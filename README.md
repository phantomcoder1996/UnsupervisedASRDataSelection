These are the training subsets that are used to fine-tune the hubert model and get the results in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01661

The subsets are selected from librispeech corpus and are either 10 hour or 1 hour subsets.

The thesis [a relative link](ReemGody_UTThesis.pdf) has more detailed results for the experiments and provides a deeper analysis. The appendices have the detailed statistics of the selected subsets as well as the WER for each run.
