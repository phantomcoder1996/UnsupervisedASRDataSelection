HE INVENTED THIS SORT OF COVER FOR THEM
HE HAD GOT A VERY THE SUIT OF ARMOR MADE WITH FINE MARTIAL ORNAMENTS IN GALILEE AND BECAUSE HIS PRESENT SICKNESS HINDERED HIM FROM COMING AND SEEING ALL THAT FINERY HE VERY MUCH DESIRED TO SEE HIM NOW IN HIS ARMOR BECAUSE SAID HE
THAT HIS ACTION MIGHT BE OBSERVED BY ALL HE SHEATHED HIS ENTIRE SWORD INTO HIS OWN BOWELS THIS YOUNG MAN WAS TO BE PITIED ON ACCOUNT OF THE STRENGTH OF HIS BODY AND THE COURAGE OF HIS SOUL BUT SINCE HE HAD ASSURED FOREIGNERS OF HIS FIDELITY
EIGHT ABOUT THIS TIME IT WAS THAT THE PEOPLE OF DAMASCUS OUT OF THEIR HATRED TO PTOLEMY THE SON OF MENHENS INVITED ARETAS TO TAKE THE GOVERNMENT AND MADE HIM KING OF CELESYRIA THIS MAN ALSO MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST JUDEA
AND SO MUCH OF THE WALL AS ENCLOSED THE CITY ON THE WEST SIDE THIS WALL WAS SPARED IN ORDER TO AFFORD A CAMP FOR SUCH AS WERE TO LIE IN GARRISON AS WERE THE TOWERS ALSO SPARED IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE TO POSTERITY WHAT KIND OF CITY IT WAS AND HOW WELL FORTIFIED
AND AS GREAT A QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS AS WOULD SUFFICE THEM FOR A LONG TIME AND LET HIMSELF AND ALL THEM DOWN INTO A CERTAIN SUBTERRANEOUS CAVERN THAT WAS NOT VISIBLE ABOVE GROUND NOW SO FAR AS HAD BEEN DIGGED OF OLD
WHICH WAS DISTANT SEVEN FURLONGS FROM THE CITY
THOUGHT OF DIMINISHING THE HONORS WHICH ALEXANDER HAD BESTOWED ON THE JEWS BUT STILL CONFLICTS PERPETUALLY AROSE WITH THE GRECIANS AND ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNORS DID EVERY DAY PUNISH MANY OF THEM YET DID THE SEDITION GROW WORSE BUT AT THIS TIME ESPECIALLY
AND ON THE THIRD DAY AFTERWARD HE SPAKE OUT OF THE GROUND TO THOSE THAT WITH GREAT LAMENTATION WERE SEARCHING FOR HIM IN ORDER TO GIVE HIM A DECENT FUNERAL AND WHEN HE WAS COME OUT HE FILLED ALL THE JEWS WITH AN UNEXPECTED JOY AS THOUGH HE WERE PRESERVED BY GOD'S PROVIDENCE TO BE THEIR COMMANDER
BEING THE WEAKER PART OF THEM GAVE IT OUT THAT AS THE TIMES WERE HE WAS THE HAPPIEST AND MOST RELIGIOUS MAN WHO SHOULD DIE FIRST BUT AS TO THE MORE BOLD AND HARDY MEN THEY GOT TOGETHER IN BODIES AND FELL A ROBBING OTHERS AFTER VARIOUS MANNERS
WHICH THE ROMAN VALOR HAD SUBDUED
BY SLAYING SO MANY OF THOSE THAT WERE RELATED TO ME WHEREFORE WE VERY JUSTLY EXPERIENCE THE PERFIDIOUSNESS OF FOREIGNERS WHILE WE ACTED AFTER A MOST WICKED MANNER AGAINST OUR OWN NATION
WHICH STILL APPEARED HEREUPON A LAMENTABLE CRY AROSE AMONG THE SPECTATORS AS IF THE SERVANT HAD SPILLED THE BLOOD ON PURPOSE IN THAT PLACE AND AS THE KING HEARD THAT CRY HE INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF IT AND WHILE NOBODY DURST TELL HIM
BUT WHEN HE HAD MADE SLAVES OF THE CITIZENS OF ALL THESE CITIES THE NATION OF THE JEWS MADE AN INSURRECTION AGAINST HIM AT A FESTIVAL FOR AT THOSE FEASTS SEDITIONS ARE GENERALLY BEGUN AND IT LOOKED AS IF HE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ESCAPE THE PLOT THEY HAD LAID FOR HIM
FOR THESE COHORTS WERE NEW RAISED MEN GATHERED OUT OF SYRIA AND HERE WAS NO MIXTURE OF THOSE CALLED VETERAN SOLDIERS AMONG THEM WHO MIGHT HAVE SUPPORTED THOSE THAT WERE UNSKILLFUL IN WAR TWO
WITH SIX MEN IN DEPTH WHICH WERE FOLLOWED AT LAST BY A CENTURION WHO ACCORDING TO CUSTOM OBSERVED THE REST AS FOR THE SERVANTS OF EVERY LEGION THEY ALL FOLLOWED THE FOOTMEN AND LED THE BAGGAGE OF THE SOLDIERS
FOR FLORUS CAUGHT SUCH AS RAN AWAY AND SENT THEM IN BONDS TO THE GALLEYS
AFTER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS OF THE EMPIRE OF SELEUCUS THREE THIS SIMON ALSO HAD A PLOT LAID AGAINST HIM AND WAS SLAIN AT A FEAST BY HIS SON IN LAW PTOLEMY WHO PUT HIS WIFE AND TWO SONS INTO PRISON AND SENT SOME PERSONS TO KILL JOHN WHO WAS ALSO CALLED HYRCANUS
CHAPTER FOUR JOSEPHUS MAKES AN ATTEMPT UPON SEPPHORIS BUT IS REPELLED
HE HEARD THAT ARISTOBULUS WAS FLED TO ALEXANDRIUM WHICH IS A STRONG HOLD FORTIFIED WITH THE UTMOST MAGNIFICENCE AND SITUATED UPON A HIGH MOUNTAIN AND HE SENT TO HIM AND COMMANDED HIM TO COME DOWN NOW HIS INCLINATION WAS TO TRY HIS FORTUNE IN A BATTLE
WHICH WAS MADE AFTER THE MANNER FOLLOWING THIS SIMON DURING THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM WAS IN THE UPPER CITY BUT WHEN THE ROMAN ARMY WAS GOTTEN WITHIN THE WALLS AND WERE LAYING THE CITY WASTE HE THEN TOOK THE MOST FAITHFUL OF HIS FRIENDS WITH HIM
AND APAMIANS SPARED THOSE THAT DWELT WITH THEM AND WOULD NOT ENDURE EITHER TO KILL ANY OF THE JEWS OR TO PUT THEM IN BONDS
AND UPON HIS HEARING HOW THE AFFAIRS OF JUDEA STOOD HE MADE HASTE THITHER AS TO A CERTAIN BOOTY THREE AS SOON THEREFORE AS HE WAS COME INTO THE COUNTRY THERE CAME AMBASSADORS FROM BOTH THE BROTHERS EACH OF THEM DESIRING HIS ASSISTANCE
ALEXANDRA REIGNS NINE YEARS DURING WHICH TIME THE PHARISEES WERE THE REAL RULERS OF THE NATION ONE
AND NO ONE MAY INSULT UPON ME AS I FALL NOW WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS HE LOOKED ROUND ABOUT HIM UPON HIS FAMILY WITH EYES OF COMMISERATION AND OF RAGE THAT FAMILY CONSISTED OF A WIFE AND CHILDREN AND HIS AGED PARENTS
HE HAD WON THE CITY PRESENTLY AND THE WAR HAD BEEN PUT AN END TO AT ONCE
AND WHEN HE HAD SLAIN MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND OF THE REBELS HE MADE AN INCURSION INTO ARABIA AND WHEN HE HAD TAKEN THAT COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH THE GILEADIRES AND MOABITES HE ENJOINED THEM TO PAY HIM TRIBUTE
AND THUS HE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BY THE BY DURING THE SIEGE OF THE CITY FOR HE HAD HIS ENEMIES IN GREAT CONTEMPT ALREADY NINE WHEN HE HAD THUS MARRIED MARIAMNE HE
THE YEAR OF REST CAME ON UPON WHICH THE JEWS REST EVERY SEVENTH YEAR AS THEY DO ON EVERY SEVENTH DAY ON THIS YEAR THEREFORE PTOLEMY WAS FREED FROM BEING BESIEGED AND SLEW THE BRETHREN OF JOHN WITH THEIR MOTHER AND FLED TO ZENO
OR WITH ITS PILLAGE OR WITH THE GREAT SLAUGHTER HE HAD MADE THERE BUT BEING OVERCOME WITH HIS VIOLENT PASSIONS AND REMEMBERING WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED DURING THE SIEGE HE COMPELLED THE JEWS TO DISSOLVE THE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRY AND TO KEEP THEIR INFANTS UNCIRCUMCISED
AND BY REASON THAT THE JEWS WHO WERE ABOUT HEROD EARNESTLY ENDEAVORED THAT NONE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES MIGHT REMAIN SO THEY WERE CUT TO PIECES BY GREAT MULTITUDES AS THEY WERE CROWDED TOGETHER IN NARROW STREETS AND IN HOUSES OR WERE RUNNING AWAY TO THE TEMPLE
AND WERE ABOUT TO OPEN THE GATES FOR HIM BUT HE OVERLOOKED THIS OFFER PARTLY OUT OF HIS ANGER AT THE JEWS AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE DID NOT THOROUGHLY BELIEVE THEY WERE IN EARNEST
BUT THIS NOT WITHOUT GREAT ENCOMIUMS AND FLATTERING COMPELLATIONS SUCH AS NECESSITY REQUIRED AND SUCH AS MIGHT MOLLIFY HIM INTO COMPLAISANCE
WHO WAS TYRANT OF PHILADELPHIA FIVE AND NOW ANTIOCHUS WAS SO ANGRY AT WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED FROM SIMON THAT HE MADE AN EXPEDITION INTO JUDEA AND SAT DOWN BEFORE JERUSALEM AND BESIEGED HYRCANUS
CHAPTER ONE HOW THE CITY JERUSALEM WAS TAKEN AND THE TEMPLE PILLAGED BY ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES AS ALSO CONCERNING THE ACTIONS OF THE MACCABEES MATTHIAS AND JUDAS
AS THEIR ABILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GIVE THEM LEAVE
UPON THE CONFIDENCE OF WHICH VICTORY HEROD HAD MARCHED IMMEDIATELY TO JERUSALEM
AND GAVE ORDER THAT IF THEY COULD TAKE THAT CITY BY SURPRISE THEY SHOULD KEEP IT BUT THAT IN CASE THE CITIZENS SHOULD PERCEIVE THEY WERE COMING TO ATTACK THEM
AND LEARNED OF HIM THE WHOLE TRUTH AND KEPT HIM IN BONDS AND LET CAESAR KNOW THAT HE WAS TAKEN
THEY ALSO ESTEEM ANY ERRORS THEY COMMIT UPON TAKING COUNSEL BEFOREHAND TO BE BETTER THAN SUCH RASH SUCCESS AS IS OWING TO FORTUNE ONLY BECAUSE SUCH A FORTUITOUS ADVANTAGE TEMPTS THEM TO BE INCONSIDERATE WHILE CONSULTATION THOUGH IT MAY SOMETIMES FAIL OF SUCCESS
THIS DISCOURSE OF THE ROMAN MILITARY CONDUCT MAY ALSO PERHAPS BE OF USE TO SUCH OF THE CURIOUS AS ARE IGNORANT OF IT AND YET HAVE A MIND TO KNOW IT I RETURN NOW FROM THIS DIGRESSION
AND PERSUADED HIM TO HAVE THEM SLAIN THAT SO SHE MIGHT EASILY GAIN TO BE MISTRESS OF WHAT THEY HAD NAY SHE EXTENDED HER AVARICIOUS HUMOR TO THE JEWS AND ARABIANS
GOT UPON AN ACCLIVITY WHENCE THE CITY MIGHT EASILY BE TAKEN JOSEPHUS WAS THEN IN FEAR FOR THE CITY AND LEAPED OUT AND ALL THE JEWISH MULTITUDE WITH HIM
AND PUT THE HINDMOST OF THE ARMY INTO DISORDER AND CARRIED OFF MANY OF THE BEASTS THAT CARRIED THE WEAPONS OF WAR AND LED SHEM INTO THE CITY BUT AS CESTIUS TARRIED THERE THREE DAYS THE JEWS SEIZED UPON THE ELEVATED PARTS OF THE CITY
AMONG THE MOUNTAINS WHILE THE REST
OR THE NEW CITY ON FIRE AS HE DID ALSO TO THE TIMBER MARKET AFTER WHICH HE CAME INTO THE UPPER CITY AND PITCHED HIS CAMP OVER AGAINST THE ROYAL PALACE AND HAD HE BUT AT THIS VERY TIME ATTEMPTED TO GET WITHIN THE WALLS BY FORCE
HE ALSO BUILT A GOOD NUMBER OF TOWERS UPON THE WALL AND FITTED IT TO STRONG BATTLEMENTS
LUCY FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CRAWLEY THE MORE SO AS MISSUS ROBARTS AND MISSUS CRAWLEY PRESENTLY WITHDREW INTO A BEDROOM TAKING THE TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH THEM HOW UNLUCKY THOUGHT LUCY THAT SHE HAS NOT GOT MY MUFF WITH HER
I DID VENTURE TO BRING THEM SAID FANNY WITH A LOOK OF SHAME FOR I KNOW HOW A SICK CHILD OCCUPIES THE WHOLE HOUSE AH MY FRIEND SAID MISSUS CRAWLEY TAKING HOLD OF MISSUS ROBARTS ARM AND LOOKING INTO HER FACE THAT SORT OF SHAME IS OVER WITH ME
SHE WAS DRIVEN TO CONFESS THAT THE LABEL WOULD IN TRUTH BE NOW TOO LATE THAT THE CAUTION HAD COME TO HER AFTER THE POISON HAD BEEN SWALLOWED WAS THERE ANY ANTIDOTE THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS LEFT FOR HER TO CONSIDER
I DID NOT SAY THAT OR THAT I HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO FLIRT WITH ME I DID NOT MEAN TO SHOCK YOU LUCY WHAT DID YOU MEAN FANNY WHY JUST THIS
LORD LUFTON WANTS ME TO LEARN TO RIDE SAID SHE
BUT IT WAS NOT QUITE SO EASY TO SAY WHAT LUDOVIC MIGHT DO OR THINK BUT LADY LUFTON WENT ON I AM SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ME FANNY WITH YOUR EXCELLENT SENSE AND TACT LUCY IS CLEVER AND AMUSING AND ALL THAT
THEY THEN WALKED UP TO THE HALL DOOR IN SILENCE WHEN THEY HAD REACHED IT LUCY STOOD IN THE DOORWAY INSTEAD OF ENTERING IT AND SAID FANNY LET US TAKE ANOTHER TURN TOGETHER IF YOU ARE NOT TIRED NO I'M NOT TIRED
WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR THAT HE WAS WANTED IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY AT WHICH HIS ATTENDANCE WAS ALWAYS REQUIRED IN HIS PARISH SCHOOL AND THAT ATTENDANCE BEING SO PUNCTUALLY GIVEN THOSE WHO WANTED HIM LOOKED FOR HIM THERE AT THIS HOUR AND IF HE WERE ABSENT DID NOT SCRUPLE TO SEND FOR HIM
SHE HAD DECLARED TO HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND COULD NOT LOVE HIM AND HAD THUS THROWN AWAY NOT ONLY RICHES AND HONOUR AND HIGH STATION BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SHE HAD FLUNG AWAY FROM HER THE LOVER TO WHOSE LOVE HER WARM HEART CLUNG
AND HIS LORDSHIP GIVING ME MY FIRST LESSON I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD LIKE IT SAID FANNY I'M SURE SHE WOULD NOT BUT I WILL NOT TRY HER TEMPER IN THAT RESPECT SOMETIMES I FANCY THAT SHE DOES NOT EVEN LIKE SEEING LORD LUFTON TALKING TO ME
AND IN THE EVENING HE AND SOWERBY HAD PLAYED BILLIARDS SOWERBY HAD WON A POUND OR TWO AND THAT HAD BEEN THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE DONE BUT THOSE SAUNTERINGS OVER TO THE PARSONAGE MIGHT BE MORE DANGEROUS
THAT HE WOULD BE BETTER FITTED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS OWN DUTIES BUT HE ANSWERS ME ANGRILY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HIS COAT IS NOT FIT FOR THE DEAN'S TABLE AND MISSUS CRAWLEY ALMOST BLUSHED AS SHE SPOKE OF SUCH A REASON WHAT WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE DOCTOR ARABIN
FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
SAID FANNY NOT KNOWING WHAT ANSWER TO MAKE TO SUCH A PROPOSITION YES SAID HE THIS HORSE WOULD CARRY HER BEAUTIFULLY HE IS AS QUIET AS A LAMB AND I MADE GREGORY GO OUT WITH HIM YESTERDAY WITH A SHEET HANGING OVER HIM LIKE A LADY'S HABIT
MISSUS ROBARTS AS SHE SAW THEM COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT THERE MIGHT BE CAUSE FOR LADY LUFTON'S FEARS BUT THEN LUCY'S MANNER AS MISSUS ROBARTS APPROACHED WAS CALCULATED TO DISSIPATE ANY SUCH FEARS
YES MY DEAR ABOUT LUCY SHE IS A VERY NICE GOOD GIRL AND A CREDIT TO HER FATHER AND A GREAT COMFORT TO US SAID FANNY I AM SURE SHE IS SHE MUST BE A VERY PLEASANT COMPANION TO YOU AND SO USEFUL ABOUT THE CHILDREN BUT
AS SHE CAME SUDDENLY WITHIN SIGHT OF THEM SHE COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE IN CLOSE CONVERSATION LORD LUFTON'S FACE WAS TOWARDS HER AND HIS HORSE WAS STANDING STILL HE WAS LEANING OVER TOWARDS HIS COMPANION AND THE WHIP WHICH HE HELD IN HIS RIGHT HAND
BUT WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY BE CAST OUT WITH UTTER SCORN BY MISTER CRAWLEY IF TENDERED IN HIS IMMEDIATE PRESENCE THERE HAD ALSO BEEN A SUGGESTION AS TO ADDING TWO OR THREE BOTTLES OF PORT BUT THE COURAGE OF THE LADIES HAD FAILED THEM ON THAT HEAD AND THE WINE WAS NOT NOW ADDED TO THEIR DIFFICULTIES
BUT YOUNG LADIES SOMETIMES ALLOW THEMSELVES TO FALL IN LOVE AND THEN TO THINK THEMSELVES VERY ILL USED JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD NO IDEA IN THEIR HEAD I WILL PUT HER ON HER GUARD IF YOU WISH IT LADY LUFTON EXACTLY MY DEAR
AND HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGERS AT THE SHOP GIRL YOU MUST GIVE HER TWO KISSES FOR THAT HEAP OF BARLEY SUGAR LOOKING AT BOBBY'S MOUTH AT THE TIME ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HIS KISSES MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WHEN THEY WERE AGAIN IN THE PONY CARRIAGE BEHIND THE IMPATIENT PUCK AND WERE WELL AWAY FROM THE DOOR
NOT MORE THAN I SHALL GET AGAIN SAID MARK
SPEAKING WITH THE OBJECT OF ASSISTING HER LADYSHIP IN HER EMBARRASSMENT BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS SHE AND LORD LUFTON ARE GETTING INTO THE WAY OF BEING TOO MUCH TOGETHER OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER TOO EXCLUSIVELY
THE ENJOYMENT OF ONE'S OWN HAPPINESS AT SUCH WINDFALLS DEPENDS SO MUCH ON THE FREE AND FREELY EXPRESSED ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS LADY LUFTON'S CONGRATULATIONS HAD NEARLY MADE HIM THROW UP THE WHOLE THING BUT HIS WIFE'S SMILES RE ENCOURAGED HIM
THAT LORD LUFTON WAS ANNOYED BECAUSE LUCY WOULD NOT CONSENT TO LEARN TO RIDE WHEREAS SHE LUCY HERSELF HAD GIVEN HER REFUSAL IN A FIRM AND DECIDED TONE AS THOUGH RESOLVED THAT NOTHING MORE SHOULD BE SAID ABOUT IT
I KNOW IT WILL BE SAID OF LORD LUFTON HIMSELF THAT PUTTING ASIDE HIS PEERAGE AND BROAD ACRES AND HANDSOME SONSY FACE HE WAS NOT WORTH A GIRL'S CARE AND LOVE
WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT FROM MISTER SOWERBY SOME LITTLE TIME SINCE WITH THE OBJECT OF OBLIGING HIM HE MARK INTENDED TO SELL HIM AGAIN AS SOON AS HE COULD DO SO JUDICIOUSLY THIS AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE WAS NOT SATISFACTORY
THAT A MATCH WAS POSSIBLE BETWEEN LORD LUFTON AND LUCY ROBARTS NOR HAD SHE THE SLIGHTEST WISH TO ENCOURAGE IT NOW THAT THE IDEA WAS SUGGESTED TO HER ON SUCH A MATTER SHE COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH LADY LUFTON THOUGH SHE DID NOT COMPLETELY AGREE WITH HER
IF LUCY WOULD PERSIST IN SECURING TO HERSELF SO MUCH OF LORD LUFTON'S TIME AND ATTENTION HER VISITS TO FRAMLEY COURT MUST BECOME LESS FREQUENT LADY LUFTON WOULD DO MUCH VERY MUCH INDEED FOR HER FRIENDS AT THE PARSONAGE
WE ARE GOING TO DRIVE OVER TO HOGGLESTOCK THIS MORNING FANNY SAID ONE DAY AT BREAKFAST I SUPPOSE MARK YOU WON'T GO WITH US
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE WHY PUCK THE PONY WAS BEATEN MARK ROBARTS RETURNED HOME THE DAY AFTER THE SCENE AT THE ALBANY CONSIDERABLY RELIEVED IN SPIRIT
LUCY COULD LISTEN TO THE YOUNG LORD'S VOICE BY THE HOUR TOGETHER WITHOUT BEING DAZZLED IN THE LEAST UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TWO THINGS OCCURRED TO HER SHE WOULD SPEAK EITHER TO HER SON OR TO FANNY ROBARTS AND BY A LITTLE DIPLOMACY
WHETHER LORD LUFTON LIKES HER I THINK HE DOES IN A SORT OF WAY HE DID NOT TALK TO HER SO MUCH AS HE DID TO YOU AH THAT WAS ALL LADY LUFTON'S FAULT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE HIM PROPERLY LABELLED
WHICH THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE IN MISTER CRAWLEY'S PRESENCE SHE AS WE HAVE SAID WAS NOT QUITE SO GAUNT NOT ALTOGETHER SO HAGGARD AS IN THE LATTER OF THOSE DREADFUL CORNISH DAYS LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ARABIN BETWEEN THEM
THAT ALL THE WORK OF HER MIND SHOULD BE GIVEN UP TO SUCH SUBJECTS AS THESE BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD BEAR IT SHE SAID AS LONG AS HE WOULD CARRY HIMSELF LIKE A MAN AND FACE HIS LOT BOLDLY BEFORE THE WORLD AND THEN SHE TOLD HOW HE HAD BEEN BETTER THERE AT HOGGLESTOCK THAN IN THEIR FORMER RESIDENCE DOWN IN CORNWALL
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GENTLEMAN IS VERY RICH AND A LORD AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING NOBODY FOR A MOMENT ATTRIBUTES ANYTHING WRONG TO YOU LUCY ANYTHING WRONG NO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD BE ANYTHING WRONG EVEN IF I WERE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM
BUT SUCH A FRIEND MUST BE EQUAL NOT ONLY IN MIND BUT IN PURSE AND WHERE CAN HE EVER FIND SUCH A MAN AS THAT BUT YOU MAY GET BETTER PREFERMENT AH NO AND IF HE DID WE ARE HARDLY FIT FOR IT NOW IF I COULD THINK THAT I COULD EDUCATE MY CHILDREN
THE HOUSE WILL NOT BE FURNISHED WILL IT MARK SAID HIS WIFE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE SHALL GET ON DON'T FRIGHTEN YOURSELVES I SHALL TAKE LODGINGS IN BARCHESTER AND WE SHALL NOT SEE YOU ALL THE TIME SAID MISSUS ROBARTS WITH DISMAY
BUT THE PREBENDARY EXPLAINED THAT HE WOULD BE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AT FRAMLEY EVERY WEEK AND THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WOULD ONLY SLEEP AT BARCHESTER ON THE SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS AND PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS THEN
THE PONY CARRIAGE IS WRETCHED FOR THREE OH AS FOR THAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE NEW HORSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY YOU AS FAR AS THAT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO SEE MISTER CRAWLEY SO I DO AND THE NEW HORSE AS YOU CALL HIM SHALL CARRY ME THERE TO MORROW
OH NO I COULD NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS IN THAT WAY BUT HE WOULD NOT GO HE COULD GO AND LEAVE ME AT HOME SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND I HAVE DONE ALL IN MY POWER TO PERSUADE HIM I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD MIX ONCE MORE WITH THE WORLD WITH THE CLERICAL WORLD YOU KNOW
BUT SHE HARDLY THOUGHT IT WORTH HER WHILE TO SAY SO MISSUS ROBARTS IMMEDIATELY STARTED OFF ON HER WALK TO HER OWN HOME AND WHEN SHE HAD GOT OUT OF THE GROUNDS INTO THE ROAD WHERE IT MAKES A TURN TOWARDS THE PARSONAGE
BUT STILL IT MAY BE WELL THAT YOU SHOULD JUST SAY A WORD TO HER A LITTLE MANAGEMENT NOW AND THEN IN SUCH MATTERS IS SO USEFUL BUT WHAT SHALL I SAY TO HER
HE'S GONE UP BY THE HOIST SAID THE SERGEANT RUNNING UP THE LADDER IN THE CORNER TO THE NEXT FLOOR AND ELEVATING THE LIGHT JUST IN TIME TO SEE BOB'S SUSPENDED FIGURE ASCENDING IN THE SAME WAY THROUGH THE SAME SORT OF
AND BY THE TIME THEY REACHED THE NARROWS THE LOVERS WHO WALKED BUT SLOWLY WERE VISIBLE IN FRONT OF THEM THERE'S YOUR MAN HE SAID THAT BUCK IN PANTALOONS AND HALF BOOTS A LOOKING LIKE A SQUIRE TWELVE MONTHS AGO HE WAS MATE OF THE BRIG PEWIT
A SAILOR ENTERS THE REMAINING FORTNIGHT OF THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER PASSED AWAY WITH A GENERAL DECLINE FROM THE SUMMER'S EXCITEMENTS
IN SPITE OF THE DARKNESS THEY BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE UP THE LADDER BOB THEREUPON SHUT THE DOOR WHICH BEING BUT OF SLIGHT CONSTRUCTION WAS AS HE KNEW ONLY A MOMENTARY DEFENCE
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS THIS I'VE HIT UPON A PLAN TO GET OUT OF THE AWKWARD CORNER SHE HAS PUT US IN WHAT YOU'LL THINK OF IT I CAN'T SAY DAVID HAS JUST GIVEN ME THE HEADS
O NOW HE SAW TRUMPET MAJOR LOVEDAY COURTING SOMEBODY LIKE YOU IN THAT GARDEN WALK AND WHEN HE CAME YOU RAN INDOORS
JOHN LEFT THE ROOM WHEN HE GAINED THE LOWER APARTMENT HIS FATHER WAS STANDING BY THE CHIMNEY PIECE THE SAILOR HAVING GONE THE TRUMPET MAJOR WENT UP TO THE FIRE AND GRASPING THE EDGE OF THE HIGH CHIMNEY SHELF STOOD SILENT
THEY LOOKED UP THE HOOK BY WHICH BOB HAD HELD ON HAD ASCENDED TO THE ROOF AND WAS WINDING ROUND THE CYLINDER NOTHING WAS VISIBLE ELSEWHERE BUT BOARDED DIVISIONS LIKE THE STALLS OF A STABLE ON EACH SIDE OF THE STAGE THEY STOOD UPON
DON'T YOU REMEMBER MA'AM WE WALKED SOME WAY TOGETHER TOWARDS OVERCOMBE EARLIER IN THE SUMMER MATILDA LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AND PERCEIVED THAT THE SPEAKER WAS DERRIMAN IN PLAIN CLOTHES HE CONTINUED YOU ARE ONE OF THE LADIES OF THE THEATRE I KNOW
UNDER THE APPLE TREE BUT SHE WAS NOT FACING IN HIS DIRECTION HE WALKED WITH A NOISIER TREAD
WELL DON'T SAY ANYTHING AGAINST HER FATHER IMPLORED BOB TWAS A SORRY HAUL AND THERE'S AN END ON'T LET HER DOWN QUIETLY AND KEEP THE SECRET YOU PROMISE THAT
THEY FOUND HER LYING INSENSIBLE UPON THE FLOOR THE TRUMPET MAJOR HIS LIPS TIGHTLY CLOSED LIFTED HER IN HIS ARMS AND LAID HER UPON THE BED AFTER WHICH HE WENT BACK TO THE DOOR TO GIVE ROOM TO HER MOTHER WHO WAS BENDING OVER THE GIRL WITH SOME HARTSHORN
TO EVERY CONCEIVABLE SURMISE ON THE CAUSE OF MISS JOHNSON'S DISAPPEARANCE THAT THE HUMAN MIND COULD FRAME TO WHICH ANNE RETURNED MONOSYLLABIC ANSWERS THE RESULT NOT OF INDIFFERENCE
SHALL WE GO DANCE THE ROUND YOUR SISTER IS LIVELY AT THE NEWS OBSERVED JIM CORNICK YES MURMURED JOHN GLOOMILY AS HE GNAWED HIS LOWER LIP AND KEPT HIS EYES FIXED ON THE FIRE WELL CONTINUED THE MAN FROM THE VICTORY
THOUGH OLD MISTER LOVEDAY WAS NOT TO BE SEEN HE HAD RETIRED AS SOON AS HE HEARD THE HORSE'S HOOFS IN THE LANE
ANNE WATCHED THESE ROMANTIC PROCEEDINGS FROM HER WINDOW WITH MUCH INTEREST AND WHEN SHE SAW HOW TRIUMPHANTLY OTHER HANDSOME GIRLS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WALKED BY ON THE GORGEOUS ARMS OF LIEUTENANT KNOCKHEELMANN
WHICH IS ONLY SEEN AFTER A CENTURY OF CONSTANT CULTIVATION THE PATHS WERE GRASSED OVER SO THAT PEOPLE CAME AND WENT UPON THEM WITHOUT BEING HEARD THE GRASS HARBOURED SLUGS
AND HE TOLD SHE HAS MADE GREAT FOOLS OF US SAID THE MILLER DELIBERATELY AND SHE MIGHT HAVE MADE US GREATER ONES BOB I
HE'S HERE HE'S HERE THE MEN EXCLAIMED RUNNING BACK FROM THE TREE BY THIS TIME THEY HAD OBTAINED ANOTHER LIGHT AND PURSUED HIM CLOSELY ALONG THE BACK QUARTERS OF THE MILL
DO YOU SEE THAT SOLDIER WALKING ALONG HE'S A MARINE HE LOOKS INTO THE GALLERY OF THE THEATRE EVERY NIGHT AND HE'S IN CONNEXION WITH THE PRESS GANG THAT CAME ASHORE JUST NOW FROM THE FRIGATE LYING IN PORTLAND ROADS THEY ARE OFTEN HERE FOR MEN YES
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE'S IN THE HOUSE HE MAY BE AND HE MAY NOT
HE DID NOT POSITIVELY GO TOWARDS HOME AT LAST HE TOOK A GUINEA FROM HIS POCKET AND RESOLVED TO PUT THE QUESTION TO THE HAZARD HEADS I GO TAILS I DON'T
WHO WORE CLOTHES ENOUGH IN AUGUST TO MELT THEM NOBODY WOULD HAVE GUESSED FROM BOB'S PRESENTATION NOW THAT HE HAD EVER BEEN ALOFT ON A DARK NIGHT IN THE ATLANTIC OR KNEW THE HUNDRED INGENUITIES THAT COULD BE PERFORMED WITH A ROPE'S END AND A MARLINE SPIKE AS WELL AS HIS MOTHER TONGUE
AND BEYOND THEM WAS THE GREY SEA PARTED INTO TWO MASSES BY THE TAPERING BRAID OF MOONLIGHT ACROSS THE WAVES TWO FORMS CROSSED THIS LINE AT A STARTLING NEARNESS TO HER SHE MARKED THEM AT ONCE AS ANNE AND BOB LOVEDAY THEY WERE WALKING SLOWLY
AND AFTER STABLING THE HORSE THEY ENTERED THE TOWN TOGETHER THE TRUMPET MAJOR INFORMING THEM THAT THE WATERING PLACE HAD NEVER BEEN SO FULL BEFORE THAT THE COURT THE PRINCE OF WALES AND EVERYBODY OF CONSEQUENCE WAS THERE AND THAT AN ATTIC COULD SCARCELY BE GOT FOR MONEY
THE KING CAME ASHORE WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HAND AND RETURNED THE SALUTATIONS OF THE WELL DRESSED CROWD IN HIS OLD INDISCRIMINATE FASHION WHILE THIS CHEERING AND WAVING OF HANDKERCHIEFS WAS GOING ON
THEY TORE ON RAPIDLY AND THE FOOTSTEPS PREVIOUSLY HEARD BECAME AUDIBLE AGAIN INCREASING IN CLEARNESS WHICH TOLD THAT THEY GAINED UPON THE FUGITIVE WHO IN ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES STOPPED AND TURNED THE RAYS OF THE CANDLE FELL UPON ANNE
HAD PERSONAL PROMINENCE IN THE SCENE BEEN AT THIS MOMENT PROPORTIONED TO INTENTNESS OF FEELING THE WHOLE AUDIENCE REGAL AND OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE FADED INTO AN INDISTINCT MIST OF BACKGROUND LEAVING AS THE SOLE EMERGENT AND TELLING FIGURES BOB AND ANNE AT ONE POINT
BUT FORTUNATELY THE DEADLOCK OF AWKWARD SUSPENSE INTO WHICH ALL FOUR HAD FALLEN WAS TERMINATED BY AN ACCIDENT A MESSENGER ENTERED THE KING'S BOX WITH DESPATCHES THERE WAS AN INSTANT PAUSE IN THE PERFORMANCE
HE DID EVERYTHING IN SHORT BUT THE ONE THING THAT FESTUS DID IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES CALL OUT TO HER HE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED ON THAT FOR THE WORLD ANY OF HIS SIGNS
HE CAME DOWN FROM THE CAMP TO THE MILL ALMOST EVERY DAY AND ANNE FINDING THAT HE ADROITLY WALKED AND SAT IN HIS FATHER'S PORTION OF THE GARDEN WHENEVER SHE DID SO IN THE OTHER HALF COULD NOT HELP SMILING AND SPEAKING TO HIM
WHEN HER EXCURSIONS BECAME RESTRICTED TO HER OWN PREMISES AND IN A SPOT OF THE GARDEN NOT FAR REMOVED THE TRUMPET MAJOR LOVED TO LINGER ALSO HAVING BY VIRTUE OF HIS OFFICE NO STABLE DUTY TO PERFORM
TO SHOW HOW ABSOLUTELY INDIFFERENT HE WAS TO THE FLIGHT OF TIME WHAT HAVE YOU COME FOR THAT YOU ARE SO ANXIOUS TO SEE ME
WAS SLOWLY EFFECTING A WARMER LIKING BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HIS FATHER THUS THE MONTH OF JULY PASSED THE TROOP HORSES CAME WITH THE REGULARITY OF CLOCKWORK TWICE A DAY DOWN TO DRINK UNDER HER WINDOW
AND SEATED HERSELF BENEATH THE BRANCHING TREE WHOSE BOUGHS HAD SHELTERED HER DURING SO MANY HOURS OF HER RESIDENCE HERE HER ATTENTION
HER INTERESTS HAD GRANDLY DEVELOPED FROM THE LIMITS OF OVERCOMBE AND THE TOWN LIFE HARD BY TO AN EXTENSIVENESS TRULY EUROPEAN DURING THE WHOLE MONTH OF OCTOBER HOWEVER NOT A SINGLE GRAIN OF INFORMATION REACHED HER OR ANYBODY ELSE
AND EVEN THEN HAD A DIFFICULTY IN GETTING THEM IT BEING A KING'S NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE SETTLED HE HIMSELF RETIRED TO AN OBSCURE PART OF THE PIT FROM WHICH THE STAGE WAS SCARCELY VISIBLE WE CAN SEE BEAUTIFULLY SAID BOB IN AN ARISTOCRATIC VOICE
OF CLODS HURDLES A LITTLE THATCH OR WHATEVER THEY COULD LAY HANDS ON THE TRUMPET MAJOR CONDUCTED HIS FRIENDS THENCE TO THE LARGE BARN WHICH HAD BEEN APPROPRIATED AS A HOSPITAL AND TO THE COTTAGE WITH ITS WINDOWS BRICKED UP THAT WAS USED AS THE MAGAZINE
AND A LOW UNCONSCIOUS HUMMING CAME FROM ANNE IN HER DISTANT CORNER THE FAINT MELODY CONTINUED MORE OR LESS WHEN THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE LOVEDAYS WAS RENEWED WE HEARD AFORE THAT THE VICTORY WAS NEAR KNOCKED TO PIECES SAID THE MILLER
HE SAID LET THEM THINK HER MINE
I KNOW YOUR FATHER CRIED THE TRUMPET MAJOR OLD JAMES CORNICK IT WAS THE MAN WHO HAD BROUGHT ANNE IN HIS LERRET FROM PORTLAND BILL AND BOB HASN'T GOT A SCRATCH SAID THE MILLER NOT A SCRATCH SAID CORNICK
DID I HEAR A NOISE WHEN I WENT OUT ASKED THE ELDER IN A TONE OF MISGIVING YES YOU DID SAID JOHN IT WAS SHE BUT HER MOTHER SAYS SHE IS BETTER NOW FATHER HE ADDED IMPETUOUSLY
IT WAS A CLEAR DAY IN DECEMBER THE FIRST SLIGHT SNOW OF THE SEASON HAD BEEN SIFTED OVER THE EARTH AND ONE SIDE OF THE APPLE TREE BRANCHES IN THE MILLER'S GARDEN WAS TOUCHED WITH WHITE
BUT THE WEEK WHICH HAD LED OFF WITH SUCH A DREARY PIPING WAS TO END IN ANOTHER KEY ON THE VERY DAY WHEN MACK'S ARMY WAS PILING ARMS AT THE FEET OF ITS CONQUEROR A BLOW HAD BEEN STRUCK BY BOB LOVEDAY AND HIS COMRADES
BUT OF INTENSE PREOCCUPATION PRESENTLY LOVEDAY THE FATHER CAME TO THE DOOR HER MOTHER VANISHED WITH HIM AND THEY REMAINED CLOSETED TOGETHER A LONG TIME

TORPENHOW LAUGHED AS HE ENTERED
AFTER YOU WENT AWAY I HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH MY EYES SO I WENT TO AN OCULIST AND HE TURNED A GASOGENE I MEAN A GAS ENGINE INTO MY EYE THAT WAS VERY LONG AGO HE SAID SCAR ON THE HEAD
THERE'S MORE IN A WEEK OF LIFE THAN IN A LIVELY WEEKLY NONE THE LESS I'LL SLATE HIM I'LL SLATE HIM PONDEROUSLY IN THE CATACLYSM GOOD LUCK TO YOU BUT I FANCY NOTHING SHORT OF A CROWBAR WOULD MAKE DICK WINCE
GO OUT FOR A WALK AND TRY TO CATCH SOME SELF RESPECT AND I SAY IF THE NILGHAI COMES UP THIS EVENING CAN I SHOW HIM YOUR DIGGINGS
AGAIN THE WHIRL OF WORDS BUT THIS TIME THEY CONVEYED A MEANING CAN YOU GIVE ME ANYTHING TO DRINK MANY SENTENCES WERE PRONOUNCED IN THAT DARKENED ROOM AND THE PRISONERS OFTEN NEEDED CHEERING
TO ASK WHY THE DICKENS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WASTING YOUR TIME WITH HER DON'T GENERALISE SAID THE NILGHAI BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE NOTES A DAY YOU MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH A GOOD DEAL AND BEHAVED ACCORDINGLY SHOULDN'T BEGIN THESE THINGS MY SON
WHAT'S THE ONE THING IN THE NILGHAI SAGA THAT I'VE NEVER DRAWN IN THE NUNGAPUNGA BOOK DICK CONTINUED TO TORPENHOW WHO WAS A LITTLE ASTONISHED AT THE OUTBURST
I REALLY COULD NOT SAY ONE CANNOT ASCERTAIN THE EXACT AMOUNT OF INJURY INFLICTED BY THE SWORD CUT THE SCAR IS AN OLD ONE AND EXPOSURE TO THE STRONG LIGHT OF THE DESERT DID YOU SAY WITH EXCESSIVE APPLICATION TO FINE WORK
THEY SAID THEY WERE ARTISTS AND I KNEW SOME OF THEM COULD DRAW BUT THEY WOULDN'T DRAW THEY GAVE ME TEA TEA AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON AND TALKED ABOUT ART AND THE STATE OF THEIR SOULS
OVER THERE HE POINTED EASTWARD THROUGH THE FOG AND YOU OH I'M IN THE NORTH THE BLACK NORTH ACROSS ALL THE PARK I AM VERY BUSY WHAT DO YOU DO
IF ONLY TORP WERE BACK NOW BUT TORPENHOW WAS IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
HE STUMBLED FORWARD AND PUT HIS ARM ROUND HER AND HER HEAD FELL ON HIS SHOULDER HUSH DEAR HUSH DON'T CRY YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT AND YOU'VE NOTHING TO REPROACH YOURSELF WITH YOU NEVER HAD
SINCE HE COULD STILL SEE EVERYTHING VERY CLEARLY
THAT THIS WAS NO PLACE FOR TAIL WAGGING AND SETTLED HIMSELF ON DICK'S LAP TILL IT WAS BEDTIME THEN HE WENT TO BED WITH DICK
SHE USED TO SHRIEK WITH RAGE WHEN DICK STARED AT HER BETWEEN HALF CLOSED EYES NOW SHE SULKED OR WATCHED HIM WITH DISGUST SAYING VERY LITTLE TORPENHOW HAD BEEN ABSENT FOR SIX WEEKS AN INCOHERENT NOTE HERALDED HIS RETURN NEWS
YOU'RE PLEASED TO DAY SAID BESSIE DICK WAVED HIS MAHL STICK IN MYSTIC CIRCLES AND WENT TO THE SIDEBOARD FOR A DRINK IN THE EVENING WHEN THE EXALTATION OF THE DAY HAD DIED DOWN HE WENT TO THE SIDEBOARD AGAIN AND AFTER SOME VISITS BECAME CONVINCED
BUT HE MUSTN'T GO ON WITH THIS HASN'T HE BEEN PRAISED AND COCKERED UP TOO MUCH YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE HERE HAVE NO SENSE OF PROPORTION THEY'LL CALL HIM A SECOND DETAILLE
I TOOK MY LAST SHOT BACK BEHOLD THE RESULT
YOU'RE TIED UP IN A SACK AND MADE TO RUN ABOUT BLIND BINKIE WEE WITHOUT ANY REASON AND IT HAS HURT YOUR LITTLE FEELINGS NEVER MIND
THEY WAKED THE CHAMBERS WITH SHOUTINGS AND SONG AND THE ELDER MEN WERE QUITE AS BAD AS THE YOUNGER FOR THE CHANCES OF WAR WERE IN FRONT OF THEM AND ALL KNEW WHAT THOSE MEANT
I THINK I SEE MYSELF SHIPPING FIRST CLASS ON A SIX THOUSAND TON HOTEL AND ASKING THE THIRD ENGINEER WHAT MAKES THE ENGINES GO ROUND AND WHETHER IT ISN'T VERY WARM IN THE STOKEHOLD
THE TALL PALE WIDOW FOR ME JOE THE LITTLE BROWN GIRL FOR YOU YOUNG JOE YOU'RE NEARING SIXTY WHY IS YOUR HIDE SO DARK KATIE HAS SOFT FAIR BLUE EYES WHO BLACKENED YOURS WHY HARK
EATING HIS MOUSTACHE AND WONDERING WHAT THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT WOULD BE LIKE
HE HAD SUFFERED NOW HE WOULD TAKE TOLL OF THE ILLS OF OTHERS THE FOG WAS DRIVEN APART FOR A MOMENT AND THE SUN SHONE A BLOOD RED WAFER ON THE WATER
WHERE IN THE WORLD DID YOU GET THAT SONG
AS A P AND O CARGO BOAT BUT CONTINUE AND BE SWIFT I'M GOING TO BED
WHAT DID THE GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA SAY TO THE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA
AND THAT ALL SHOULD BE AS IT WAS OF OLD SHE WORE A CLOSELY FITTING GRAY DRESS SINCE THE HUMAN SOUL IS FINITE AND NOT IN THE LEAST UNDER ITS OWN COMMAND DICK ADVANCING SAID
REPEATING THE PHRASE WITH AN AWFUL GRAVITY YOU'LL BE MORE DAMNED WHEN I'M DONE WITH YOU SAID THE NILGHAI UPHEAVING HIS BULK FROM BEHIND TORPENHOW'S SHOULDER AND WAVING A SHEAF OF HALF DRY MANUSCRIPT DICK
INDEED IT WOULD OLD MAN I SHOULDN'T HAVE SPOKEN IF I HADN'T THOUGHT SO ONLY YOU MAKE A JOKE OF EVERYTHING BEFORE GOD I DO NO SUCH THING SAID DICK QUICKLY AND EARNESTLY YOU DON'T KNOW ME IF YOU THINK THAT
WHEN YOU'RE BETTER YOU SHALL GO AWAY AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT WHAT SORT OF A PASSAGE DID YOU HAVE COMING OVER MAISIE WAS CRYING MORE SUBDUEDLY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE GLAD THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING TO LEAN AGAINST
AS HE ENTERED THE DARK HALL THAT LED TO THE CONSULTING ROOM A MAN CANNONED AGAINST HIM DICK SAW THE FACE AS IT HURRIED OUT INTO THE STREET THAT'S THE WRITER TYPE HE HAS THE SAME MODELLING OF THE FOREHEAD AS TORP HE LOOKS VERY SICK
I DON'T THINK IT SAID THE NILGHAI HOW CAN FELLOWS LIKE OURSELVES WHO KNOW WHAT LIFE AND DEATH REALLY MEAN DARE TO MAKE A JOKE OF ANYTHING I KNOW WE PRETEND IT TO SAVE OURSELVES FROM BREAKING DOWN OR GOING TO THE OTHER EXTREME
AND RETIRED INTO THE DARKNESS THAT THE SPOTS IN HIS EYES AND THE PAINS ACROSS HIS HEAD WERE VERY TROUBLESOME
TORPENHOW WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED THEY WALKED UP AND DOWN AS OF CUSTOM TORPENHOW'S HAND ON DICK'S SHOULDER AND DICK BURIED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS
A PROPHET HAS NO HONOUR IN HIS OWN COUNTRY SAID DICK RUEFULLY DUSTING HIS KNEES THIS FILTHY FLUFF WILL NEVER BRUSH OFF MY LEGS IT WAS ALL FOR YOUR OWN GOOD SAID THE NILGHAI NOTHING LIKE AIR AND EXERCISE
THERE ARE THE MAKINGS OF A VERY FINE PRIG IN YOU DICK SAID THE NILGHAI I'VE LIBERATED MY MIND ESTIMABLE BINKIE WITH THE FEATHERS IN HIS MOUTH DICK PICKED UP THE STILL INDIGNANT ONE AND SHOOK HIM TENDERLY
AND KNOW THE SEA ONCE MORE AND BY HER BEGET PICTURES TO TALK TO BINAT AMONG THE SANDS OF PORT SAID WHILE YELLOW TINA MIXED THE DRINKS TO HEAR THE CRACKLE OF MUSKETRY
SHE'S FRAMED IN BLACK IS THIS A BLACK FRAME THAT I HAVE MY HAND ON THERE SHE IS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER HE TURNED A SCARRED FORMLESS MUDDLE OF PAINT TOWARDS MAISIE
AND DON'T SNEEZE IN MY EYE BECAUSE I TALK LATIN GOOD NIGHT HE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM THAT'S DISTINCTLY ONE FOR YOU SAID THE NILGHAI I TOLD YOU IT WAS HOPELESS TO MEDDLE WITH HIM HE'S NOT PLEASED
HE DECIDED AFTER ALL THE HONEYMOON WILL BE THAT TOUR WITH RESERVATIONS ONLY
THE SEA IS A WICKED OLD WOMAN
SAID DICK DELIBERATELY I LIKE THE POWER I LIKE THE FUN I LIKE THE FUSS AND ABOVE ALL I LIKE THE MONEY I ALMOST LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE FUSS AND PAY THE MONEY ALMOST BUT THEY'RE A QUEER GANG AN AMAZINGLY QUEER GANG
HE'S WORKING FOR CASH NOW HE HAS THROWN UP WAR WORK I SUPPOSE HE DOESN'T SEE THAT THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SERVICE ARE JUST THE SAME ONLY THE PROPRIETORS ARE CHANGED HOW SHOULD HE KNOW
NOW THERE WAS ONE BLANK PAGE IN THE BOOK GIVEN OVER TO THE SKETCH THAT DICK HAD NOT DRAWN OF THE CROWNING EXPLOIT IN THE NILGHAI'S LIFE WHEN THAT MAN BEING YOUNG AND FORGETTING THAT HIS BODY AND BONES BELONGED TO THE PAPER THAT EMPLOYED HIM
WHAT POSSESSED HIM TO DO IT AND YET HOW THOROUGHLY HE HAS CAUGHT THE NOTE THAT CATCHES A PUBLIC WHO THINK WITH THEIR BOOTS AND READ WITH THEIR ELBOWS THE COLD BLOODED INSOLENCE OF THE WORK ALMOST SAVES IT
AND METHOUGHT ITS STAINING FAIR
TAKEN FROM THE COFFER WHICH WAS BUT SELDOM OPENED BECAUSE THE CLOTHS IT HELD WERE PRECIOUS AND THEY SET A GARLAND OF GREEN WHEAT EARS ON HIS HEAD THEN THEY FELL TO AND SPREAD THE FEAST IN THE HALL
DO THE SHADOWS DARKEN ABOUT IT IS THE EVEN HERE AT LAST OR IS THIS BUT A STORM OF THE NOON TIDE THAT THE WIND IS DRIVING PAST UNSCATHED AS YET IT STANDETH
AND THOSE WHO WERE NEAREST TO HIM RAISED HIM UP AND BORE HIM HASTILY ABACK OUT OF THE BATTLE AND THE ROMANS ALSO HAD BEHELD HIM FALL AND THEY ALSO DEEMED HIM DEAD OR SORE HURT AND SHOUTED FOR JOY AND LOITERED NOT
IS OVER THEN A DAMSEL BROUGHT HIM A HORN OF MEAD AND LET IT COME INTO HIS HAND AND HE DRANK SIGHING WITH PLEASURE WHILE THE DAMSEL FOR PLEASURE OF HIM AND HIS TIDINGS LAID HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER THEN HE SET DOWN THE HORN AND SPAKE
WITH JOYOUS SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER SO THEN THEY ORDERED THE RANKS ANEW AND SO SET FORWARD IN GREAT JOY WITHOUT HASTE OR TURMOIL
AND WHEN WE ARE ALL MET AND WELL ORDERED TOGETHER FALL ON THE ROMANS AT ONCE FOR THEN SHALL WE BE MORE THAN THEY WHEREAS NOW WE ARE FAR FEWER AND MOREOVER WE SHALL HAVE TO SET ON THEM IN THEIR GROUND OF VANTAGE
AND THEN THEY SAW HOW THE RING OF THE ROMANS SHOOK AND PARTED AND THEIR ARRAY FELL BACK AND LO THE COMPANY OF THE MARKMEN STANDING STOUTLY TOGETHER THOUGH SORELY MINISHED AND SURE IT WAS THAT THEY HAD NOT FLED OR BEEN SCATTERED
THEY BICKER ABOUT THE FORD IN THE GREY OF THE MORNING WAS OTTER AFOOT WITH THE WATCHERS AND PRESENTLY HE GOT ON HIS HORSE AND PEERED OVER THE PLAIN BUT THE MIST YET HUNG LOW ON IT
AND THEN DARK OVER THE WALL OF MIST SHOWED THE CRESTS OF THE RIDERS OF THE MARK THOUGH SCARCE WERE THEIR HORSES SEEN TILL THEIR WHOLE WAR RANK CAME DARK AND GLITTERING
A WHILE PASSED AND AGAIN WE HEARD THE HORN AND IT WAS NIGHER AND HAD A MARVELLOUS VOICE THEN IN A WHILE WAS A LITTLE NOISE OF MEN NOT THEIR VOICES BUT FOOTSTEPS GOING WARILY
AND WITH AS LITTLE NOISE AS MIGHT BE SO DID THEY AND THERE WAS LITTLE DELAY FOR MEN WERE SLEEPING WITH ONE EYE OPEN AS FOLK SAY AND MANY WERE ALREADY ASTIR
NOW FOR YOUR TIDINGS FELLOWS SAID GEIRBALD OUR TIDINGS ARE THAT BOTH OUR ERRANDS ARE PREVENTED AND COME TO NOUGHT FOR OTTER HATH NOT TARRIED BUT HATH RIDDEN WITH ALL HIS FOLK TOWARD THE STEAD OF THINE HOUSE
YET STILL FOUGHT THE WARRIORS OF THE KINDRED MOST VALIANTLY MAKING STAND AND FACING THE FOE AGAIN AND AGAIN IN KNOTS OF A SCORE OR TWO SCORE OR MAYBE TEN SCORE AND THOUGH MANY A MAN WAS SLAIN YET SCARCE ANY ONE BEFORE HE HAD SLAIN OR HURT A ROMAN
NOW OF THESE ELEVEN I ORDAIN HROSSHILD TO BE THE LEADER AND CAPTAIN AND TO CHOOSE FOR HER FELLOWS
TO THE SPEECH HILL FIRST BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT ONE WORD TO THEE HALL SUN SAITH THIODOLF SEND YE WATCHERS TO LOOK TO THE ENTRANCE INTO MID MARK WHICH IS BY THE BEARING DWELLING
AND IF MUCH DIKING SHALL BE DONE IN AN HOUR YET LITTLE SLAYING FORSOOTH SHALL BE DONE AND THAT ESPECIALLY IF THE FOE IS ALL ARMED AND SLAYETH WOMEN AND CHILDREN YEA IF THE BEARING WOMEN BE ALL SLAIN
THEREWITH HE LED HER TO A GRASSY KNOLL THAT WAS HARD BY AND SET HER DOWN THEREON AND HIMSELF BESIDE HER AND SAID SPEAK NOW DAMSEL AND FEAR NOT FOR NOW SHALL ONE FATE GO OVER US ALL EITHER
NOR WERE THEY OTHERWISE THAN EXCEEDING GLAD
AND THEN SPEEDILY SHALL HE BE WITH US GEIRBALD I SEE THEE COME HITHER NOW GEIRBALD STOOD AMIDST THE SHIELDINGS AND WHEN OTTER HAD SPOKEN HE CAME FORTH BESTRIDING A WHITE HORSE AND WITH HIS BOW SLUNG AT HIS BACK
MAN WOMAN AND CHILD FARED WITH THEM AND STOOD ABOUT THE SPEECH HILL AND THE DOGS WENT ROUND ABOUT THE EDGE OF THAT ASSEMBLY WANDERING IN AND OUT AND SOMETIMES LOOKING HARD ON SOME ONE WHOM THEY KNEW BEST IF HE CRIED OUT ALOUD
THOU ART ALIVE AND UNHURT WAR DUKE WHEN MANY HAVE BEEN HURT AND SLAIN AND METHINKS THY COMPANY IS LITTLE MINISHED THOUGH THE KINDRED OF THE BEARINGS LACKETH A ROOF
AND A CRY THAT A MESSENGER WAS RIDING TOWARD THE BURG THEREAT MOST MEN LOOKED ROUND TOWARD THE WOOD BECAUSE THEIR MINDS WERE SET ON FRESH TIDINGS FROM THIODOLF'S COMPANY BUT AS IT HAPPENED
BUT IT WAS A LITTLE WAY FURTHER BEFORE THEY SAW THE FRAY WITH THEIR EYES BECAUSE THE GROUND FELL AWAY FROM THE RIVER SOMEWHAT AT FIRST
WHEREIN JAVELINS AND SPEARS CAST BY THE HAND WERE MINGLED WITH THE ARROWS BUT THE ROMAN RANKS HAD FACED THE MEADOW AND THE STORM WHICH IT YIELDED SWIFTLY AND STEADILY
BUT HER COUNTENANCE WHICH HAD NOT CHANGED DURING HER SONG CHANGED NOT AT ALL NOW SO THEY ALL KEPT SILENCE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE REJOICING IN THIS NEW TALE OF VICTORY FOR THEY DEEMED THAT SHE WAS NOT YET AT THE END OF HER SPEAKING
AN OLD LEADER OF A HUNDRED CRIED OUT THE SAME TIDINGS IN THE ROMAN TONGUE AND ALL MEN FELL TO HANDLING THEIR WEAPONS BUT BEFORE THEY COULD FACE DULY TOWARD THE MEADOW
THOUGH NEVER WOULD OTTER SUFFER HIS MEN TO BE MINGLED WITH THEM AT THE LAST THE ROMANS SEEING THAT OTTER WOULD NOT WALK INTO THE OPEN TRAP AND GROWING WEARY OF THIS BICKERING BEGAN TO TAKE THE WATER LITTLE BY LITTLE
AND THEY AND THE MEN WHO ABODE THEM ON THE BANK SHOUTED TOGETHER FOR JOY OF FELLOWSHIP AND ALL TOSSED ALOFT THEIR WEAPONS THE MAN WHO HAD RIDDEN BEHIND VIGLUND SLIPPED OFF ON TO THE GROUND BUT WOLFKETTLE ABODE IN HIS PLACE BEHIND GEIRBALD
ON A ROCK BENEATH A SOLE ASH TREE THE FACE OF THE KITE'S NEST RISING BEHIND HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A BIGHT OF THE RIVER THERE HE SAT UNHELMED WITH THE DWARF WROUGHT HAUBERK ABOUT HIM
SO THAT HE MIGHT SEE NOUGHT FOR A WHILE BUT AT LAST HE SEEMED TO NOTE SOMETHING COMING TOWARD THE HOST FROM THE UPPER WATER ABOVE THE FORD SO HE RODE FORWARD TO MEET IT AND LO
AND THEREOF THE TALE TELLS THAT IT WAS A HOLY PLACE OF THE FOLK WHO ABIDED IN THESE PARTS BEFORE THE SONS OF THE GOTHS
AND IN THE MIDST OF IT WAS A TANGLE OF STRUGGLING MEN AND TOSSING SPEARS AND GLITTERING SWORDS SO WHEN THEY BEHELD THE BATTLE OF THEIR KINDRED THEY GAVE A GREAT SHOUT AND HASTENED ONWARD THE FASTER
HE HATH SEEN HIS SPEECH FRIEND GO HIS HEART HATH CONCEIVED A JOYANCE AND HATH BROUGHT IT UNTO BIRTH BUT HE HATH NOT CARRIED WITH HIM HIS SORROW OR HIS MIRTH HE HATH LIVED
AND TO BARE PLACES WHERE THE ROCKS CROP UP THROUGH THE GRAVEL AND THE WOODLAND LOAM THERE BREED THE CONEYS WITHOUT NUMBER AND WILD CATS HAUNT THE PLACE FOR THAT SAKE AND FOXES
AND THE WHOLE FOLK BROUGHT TO A PERILOUS AND FEARFUL PASS FOR IF THESE WERE SLAIN OR SCATTERED THERE WERE NO MORE BUT THEY AND NOUGHT BETWEEN FIRE AND THE SWORD AND THE PEOPLE OF THE MARK BUT ONCE AGAIN THE FAINT HEART FOLLY OF THE ROMAN CAPTAIN SAVED HIS FOES
FOR BY THIS TIME HAD MANY MORE DRAWN NEAR TO HEARKEN WHAT WAS TOWARD THERE THEY SAT ON THEIR HORSES THE WHITE AND THE GREY AND WOLFKETTLE STOOD BY GEIRBALD'S BRIDLE REIN FOR HE HAD NOW LIGHTED DOWN AND A LITTLE BEHIND HIM HIS HEAD TOWERING OVER THE OTHERS
WAS CLOSE AT HAND SO HE BADE HIM BLOW THE WAR BLAST AND ALL MEN KNEW THE MEANING OF THAT VOICE OF THE HORN AND EVERY MAN ARMED HIM IN HASTE AND THEY WHO HAD HORSES AND THESE WERE BUT THE BEARINGS AND THE WARNINGS SADDLED THEM AND MOUNTED
INTO THE SPACE OF THE RISING GROUND WHERE THE MIST WAS BUT A HAZE NOW AND NOW AT LAST SMITTEN ATHWART BY THE LOW SUN JUST ARISEN THEREWITH CAME ANOTHER STORM OF SHAFTS
BUT WENT ON SMITING TILL THEY WERE FELLED WITH MANY STROKES HOWBEIT THE ARRAY OF THE GOTHS WAS BROKEN AND MANY WERE SLAIN AND PERFORCE THEY MUST GIVE BACK AND IT SEEMED AS IF THEY WOULD BE DRIVEN INTO THE RIVER AND ALL BE LOST
AS FOR ME YE MUST EVEN LOSE A MAN'S AID
WHERE HE IS MINDED TO WEND TO MORROW BETIMES IN THE MORNING AND IF YE DO YOUR BEST YE SHALL BE THERE BEFORE HE IS UPON THE ROAD AND SURE IT IS THAT YOUR TIDINGS SHALL HASTEN HIM THOU SAYEST SOOTH SAITH GEIRBALD TARRY WE NO LONGER
OR EVER THEY HAVE SET THEIR HANDS TO THE DWELLINGS OF MY HOUSE AND BELIKE WHEN I HAVE DONE MINE ERRAND TO OTTER I SHALL RIDE WITH HIM TO LOOK ON THESE BURNERS
HER CLENCHED HANDS OPENED THE LIDS FELL DOWN OVER HER BRIGHT EYES HER BREAST HEAVED NO MORE AS IT HAD DONE AND PRESENTLY SHE FELL ASLEEP
FOR THE REST HE SEEMED TO BE IN A DREAM INDEED AND AS MEN DO IN DREAMS TO BE FOR EVER STRIVING TO BE DOING SOMETHING OF MORE MOMENT THAN ANYTHING WHICH HE DID BUT WHICH HE MUST EVER LEAVE UNDONE
AND SOME DEEMED IT EVIL FOR ANGER AND DISSENSION BETWEEN FRIENDS SEEMED ABROAD BUT SOME WERE SO EAGER FOR BATTLE
OTTER FALLS ON AGAINST HIS WILL
THAT THERE IS NO SOCIAL QUESTION EXCEPT FOR A FEW JOURNALISTS WHO TRY TO GET A LIVING OUT OF THE PHRASE THERE ARE JUST RICH AND POOR AS THERE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE POINT ME OUT A TIME WHEN MEN HAVE BEEN EQUAL
MISTER WILCOX LIKED BEING CALLED SIR HE RAISED HIS EYES AND GAVE HIS SON MORE OPEN A LOOK OF TENDERNESS THAN HE USUALLY VENTURED HE SAW CHARLES AS LITTLE BOY AND STRONG MAN IN ONE THOUGH HIS WIFE HAD PROVED UNSTABLE
AND SHE DID NOT DESIRE TO HEAR HIM ON THIS POINT DID HELEN COME SHE ASKED HE SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT THAT WON'T DO AT ALL AT ALL WE DON'T WANT HER GOSSIPING WITH MISSUS BAST
SHE PASSED ON FROM IT TO THE PLAN OF CAMPAIGN THAT HER NIECES SHOULD PURSUE IN THE FUTURE MARGARET TRIED TO STOP HER HELEN DID NOT TAKE THE NEWS QUITE AS I EXPECTED BUT THE WILCOX NERVE IS DEAD IN HER REALLY
IT IS NECESSARY TO PREPARE FOR AN EXAMINATION OR A DINNER PARTY OR A POSSIBLE FALL IN THE PRICE OF STOCK THOSE WHO ATTEMPT HUMAN RELATIONS MUST ADOPT ANOTHER METHOD OR FAIL
HER FAILURE DEPRESSED HER AND THOUGH SHE FORGOT THE FAILURE THE DEPRESSION REMAINED ON HER WAY HOME SHE AGAIN GLANCED UP AT THE WILCOXES FLAT AND TOOK THE RATHER MATRONLY STEP OF SPEAKING ABOUT THE MATTER TO HELEN
HE HAD A SAD MOUSTACHE BUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD WAS YOUNG I HAVE HAD A LETTER TOO NOT A NICE ONE I WANT TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOU FOR LEONARD BAST WAS NOTHING TO HIM NOW THAT SHE HAD GIVEN HIM HER WORD
HE STARED AT HER YOU GRAB THE DOLLARS GOD DOES THE REST
AND NEEDN'T HAVE STARTED LIFE ELSEWHERE AT A GREATLY REDUCED SALARY HE ONLY SAYS REDUCED CORRECTED MARGARET SEEING TROUBLE AHEAD WITH A MAN SO POOR EVERY REDUCTION MUST BE GREAT I CONSIDER IT A DEPLORABLE MISFORTUNE
GOD HELP THOSE WHO HAVE NONE BUT THIS IS SOMETHING QUITE NEW SAID MISSUS MUNT WHO COLLECTED NEW IDEAS AS A SQUIRREL COLLECTS NUTS AND WAS ESPECIALLY ATTRACTED BY THOSE THAT ARE PORTABLE
HELEN QUIVERED WITH INDIGNATION BY ALL MEANS SUBSCRIBE TO CHARITIES SUBSCRIBE TO THEM LARGELY BUT DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY BY ABSURD SCHEMES OF SOCIAL REFORM I SEE A GOOD DEAL BEHIND THE SCENES AND YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM ME
AND SHE WAS A WISP OF HAY A FLOWER
BENEATH THEM WAS THE BOURGEOIS LITTLE BAY
SHE HAD A FACE LIKE A SILKWORM AND THE DINING ROOM REEKS OF ORRIS ROOT WE CHATTED PLEASANTLY A LITTLE ABOUT HUSBANDS AND I WONDERED WHERE HERS WAS TOO AND ADVISED HER TO GO TO THE POLICE SHE THANKED ME
THEY WENT INTO BREAKFAST
THAT MISSUS MUNT SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO DISCOVER THE MISFORTUNE WAS NOT REMARKABLE FOR SHE WAS SO INTERESTED IN THE FLATS THAT SHE WATCHED THEIR EVERY MUTATION WITH UNWEARYING CARE IN THEORY SHE DESPISED THEM
MARGARET LOOKED INTENTLY AT THE BUTLER HE AS A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WAS FAINTLY ATTRACTIVE TO HER AS A WOMAN AN ATTRACTION SO FAINT AS SCARCELY TO BE PERCEPTIBLE
SHE WAS NOT INTELLECTUAL NOR EVEN ALERT AND IT WAS ODD THAT ALL THE SAME SHE SHOULD GIVE THE IDEA OF GREATNESS MARGARET ZIGZAGGING WITH HER FRIENDS OVER THOUGHT AND ART WAS CONSCIOUS OF A PERSONALITY THAT TRANSCENDED THEIR OWN
I MEAN THAT NO ONE IS TO LIVE THERE I WON'T HAVE IT HE LOOKED ANGRILY AT THE MOON TO MY MIND THIS QUESTION IS CONNECTED WITH SOMETHING FAR GREATER THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY ITSELF
OR LIVERPOOL STREET IN THE MORNING THE CITY INHALING OR THE SAME THOROUGHFARES IN THE EVENING THE CITY EXHALING HER EXHAUSTED AIR WE REACH IN DESPERATION BEYOND THE FOG BEYOND THE VERY STARS THE VOIDS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE RANSACKED TO JUSTIFY THE MONSTER
THE PARTICULAR MILLIONAIRE WHO OWNED THE FREEHOLD OF WICKHAM PLACE AND DESIRED TO ERECT BABYLONIAN FLATS UPON IT WHAT RIGHT HAD HE TO STIR SO LARGE A PORTION OF THE QUIVERING JELLY HE WAS NOT A FOOL
EXCLAIMING FOR EXAMPLE WHAT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOR A BASEMENT YOU'LL NEVER GET IT AND THEY WOULD ANSWER ONE CAN BUT TRY MADAM THE PASSENGER LIFTS THE PROVISION LIFTS
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO MARGARET GREETED HER LORD WITH PECULIAR TENDERNESS ON THE MORROW MATURE AS HE WAS
AND HIS SANDWICH A RELIC THIS OF SOME PREHISTORIC CRAVING WAS ALWAYS CUT BY HER OWN HAND HE DID NOT RELY UPON THE SANDWICH FOR LUNCH BUT LIKED TO HAVE IT BY HIM IN CASE HE GREW HUNGRY AT ELEVEN WHEN HE HAD GONE THERE WAS THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER
SHOULD HE GO ROUND TO THE GEORGE I'LL GO THANK YOU SAID MARGARET AND DISMISSED HIM IT IS NO GOOD SAID HENRY THOSE THINGS LEAK OUT YOU CANNOT STOP A STORY ONCE IT HAS STARTED I HAVE KNOWN CASES OF OTHER MEN
AND THROWS UPON PERSONAL RELATIONS A STRESS GREATER THAN THEY HAVE EVER BORNE BEFORE UNDER COSMOPOLITANISM IF IT COMES WE SHALL RECEIVE NO HELP FROM THE EARTH TREES AND MEADOWS AND MOUNTAINS WILL ONLY BE A SPECTACLE
BUT SHE CAN HARDLY BE COMING ISN'T SHE STOPPING WITH HER SISTER AT THE HOTEL PERHAPS SAID MISTER WILCOX THOUGHTFULLY PERHAPS CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU SIR NOT TONIGHT MY BOY
I PROMISED TO TELL YOU WITH HER LOVE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GERMANY WITH HER SISTER THIS EVENING THAT WAS ALL WE HAD TIME FOR MISTER WILCOX SEEMED RELIEVED
OH YES OR ILFRACOMBE AND SWANAGE AND TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND SURBITON AND BEDFORD THERE ON NO ACCOUNT LONDON THEN
I SEE YOUR POINT SAID MARGARET GETTING UP IF ONITON IS REALLY DAMP IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND MUST BE INHABITED BY LITTLE BOYS ONLY IN THE SPRING LET US LOOK BEFORE WE LEAP
AND HERE'S THE RESULT HE RAISED HIS FINGER NOW A WORD OF ADVICE I REQUIRE NO MORE ADVICE A WORD OF ADVICE DON'T TAKE UP THAT SENTIMENTAL ATTITUDE OVER THE POOR
MAKING MONEY A SPHERE AWAITING YOU AND SO ON ALL OF WHICH ARE FOR VARIOUS REASONS CANT SHE SEWED ON I'M ONLY YOUR SISTER I HAVEN'T ANY AUTHORITY OVER YOU AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY JUST TO PUT BEFORE YOU
YES YES HENRY I AM FAR FROM A SAINT IN FACT THE REVERSE BUT YOU HAVE
WICKHAM PLACE HAD BEEN SO SAFE SHE FEARED FANTASTICALLY THAT HER OWN LITTLE FLOCK MIGHT BE MOVING INTO TURMOIL AND SQUALOR
WHETHER AS BOY HUSBAND OR WIDOWER HE HAD ALWAYS THE SNEAKING BELIEF THAT BODILY PASSION IS BAD
ANOTHER HOUR PASSED THE SERVANTS WENT TO BED AND CHARLES VISITED HIS FATHER AGAIN TO RECEIVE FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS MISSUS WILCOX HAD STILL NOT RETURNED I'LL SIT UP FOR HER AS LATE AS YOU LIKE
FOR RICHES HURRAH FOR RICHES FOR RICHES ECHOED MISSUS MUNT HAVING AS IT WERE AT LAST SECURED HER NUT YES FOR RICHES MONEY FOR EVER SO AM I AND SO I AM AFRAID ARE MOST OF MY ACQUAINTANCES AT SWANAGE
THE TRIANGLE OF SEX WAS BROKEN FOR EVER THANKS TO YOUR HINT
HIS CHILDREN WERE LEFT TO HIM AFTER MIDNIGHT HE TAPPED ON CHARLES'S DOOR I CAN'T SLEEP HE SAID I HAD BETTER HAVE A TALK WITH YOU AND GET IT OVER HE COMPLAINED OF THE HEAT
CLIPPED WORDS FORMLESS SENTENCES POTTED EXPRESSIONS OF APPROVAL OR DISGUST MONTH BY MONTH THINGS WERE STEPPING LIVELIER BUT TO WHAT GOAL THE POPULATION STILL ROSE BUT WHAT WAS THE QUALITY OF THE MEN BORN
HOUSES HAVE THEIR OWN WAYS OF DYING FALLING AS VARIOUSLY AS THE GENERATIONS OF MEN SOME WITH A TRAGIC ROAR SOME QUIETLY BUT TO AN AFTER LIFE IN THE CITY OF GHOSTS WHILE FROM OTHERS
RELIGION HAD CONFIRMED HIM
WAS THERE SUCH A THING AS STETTININITY MARGARET SWEPT ON PEOPLE AT STETTIN DROP THINGS INTO BOATS OUT OF OVERHANGING WAREHOUSES
ONCE ON ANOTHER OCCASION SHE SCOLDED HIM ABOUT IT HE WAS PUZZLED BUT REPLIED WITH A LAUGH MY MOTTO IS CONCENTRATE I'VE NO INTENTION OF FRITTERING AWAY MY STRENGTH ON THAT SORT OF THING
BUT HELEN'S LAUGH RANG TRUE AS SHE RAISED A SOAPY HAND TO HEAVEN
SAID CHARLES WITH A SIGH IT WAS NO FUN DOING ERRANDS FOR HIS FATHER WHO WAS NEVER QUITE SATISFIED BUT THE REAL CAUSE WAS HEART DISEASE OF THAT YOU'RE SURE THAT OR A FIT
THE MORNING AND THE NIGHT VARIED ENCHANTMENTS WHEN A SINGLE TONE OF ONE VOICE COULD MAKE THE HEART BOUND AND THE MOST TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE FORM IS PUT IN THE AMBER OF MEMORY
THY LOVING HEART IN THE NOON AND THE AFTERNOON OF LIFE WE STILL THROB AT THE RECOLLECTION OF DAYS WHEN HAPPINESS WAS NOT HAPPY ENOUGH BUT MUST BE DRUGGED WITH THE RELISH OF PAIN AND FEAR FOR HE TOUCHED THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WHO SAID OF LOVE
YET THE REMEMBRANCE OF THESE VISIONS OUTLASTS ALL OTHER REMEMBRANCES AND IS A WREATH OF FLOWERS ON THE OLDEST BROWS BUT HERE IS A STRANGE FACT IT MAY SEEM TO MANY MEN IN REVISING THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND YIELD ITS OWN VIRTUE TO HIM HE SHOULD SEE THAT HE CAN LIVE ALL HISTORY IN HIS OWN PERSON HE MUST SIT SOLIDLY AT HOME AND NOT SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE BULLIED BY KINGS OR EMPIRES
SO THAT WHEN ART CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF NATURE IT COULD NOT MOVE ON A SMALL SCALE WITHOUT DEGRADING ITSELF WHAT WOULD STATUES OF THE USUAL SIZE OR NEAT PORCHES AND WINGS HAVE BEEN
ELM OAK PINE FIR AND SPRUCE THE GOTHIC CATHEDRAL
BY SURROUNDING OURSELVES WITH THE ORIGINAL CIRCUMSTANCES WE INVENT ANEW THE ORDERS AND THE ORNAMENTS OF ARCHITECTURE
THE PROPERTIES OF STONE WATER AND WOOD
FOR THIS IS THE ONLY AND SOVEREIGN AGENT OF THE WORKS OF THIS MIND HISTORY IS THE RECORD ITS GENIUS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE ENTIRE SERIES OF DAYS
IN MY OWN MIND WE ARE ALWAYS COMING UP WITH THE EMPHATIC FACTS OF HISTORY IN OUR PRIVATE EXPERIENCE AND VERIFYING THEM HERE ALL HISTORY BECOMES SUBJECTIVE IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS PROPERLY
AND FAR BACK IN THE WOMB OF THINGS SEES THE RAYS PARTING FROM ONE ORB
WHICH BELONG TO ACTS OF SELF RELIANCE IT IS REMARKABLE THAT INVOLUNTARILY WE ALWAYS READ AS SUPERIOR BEINGS UNIVERSAL HISTORY THE POETS THE ROMANCERS
WE ASSUME THAT WE UNDER LIKE INFLUENCE SHOULD BE ALIKE AFFECTED AND SHOULD ACHIEVE THE LIKE
HISTORY IS TO BE READ AND WRITTEN THUS IN ALL WAYS DOES THE SOUL CONCENTRATE AND REPRODUCE ITS TREASURES FOR EACH PUPIL HE TOO SHALL PASS THROUGH THE WHOLE CYCLE OF EXPERIENCE HE SHALL COLLECT INTO A FOCUS THE RAYS OF NATURE
MORE THAN ONCE SOME INDIVIDUAL HAS APPEARED TO ME WITH SUCH NEGLIGENCE OF LABOR AND SUCH COMMANDING CONTEMPLATION A HAUGHTY BENEFICIARY BEGGING IN THE NAME OF GOD AS MADE GOOD TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SIMEON THE STYLITE
BY INFINITE DIAMETERS GENIUS WATCHES THE MONAD THROUGH ALL HIS MASKS AS HE PERFORMS THE METEMPSYCHOSIS OF NATURE GENIUS DETECTS THROUGH THE FLY THROUGH THE CATERPILLAR
FROM ROME AND ATHENS AND LONDON TO HIMSELF AND NOT DENY HIS CONVICTION THAT HE IS THE COURT AND IF ENGLAND OR EGYPT HAVE ANY THING TO SAY TO HIM HE WILL TRY THE CASE
AND WHEN IT SHALL BE A PRIVATE OPINION AGAIN IT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE AGE THE FACT NARRATED MUST CORRESPOND TO SOMETHING IN ME TO BE CREDIBLE OR INTELLIGIBLE
WITH SOME CLOSENESS TO THE FAITH OF LATER AGES PROMETHEUS IS THE JESUS OF THE OLD MYTHOLOGY HE IS THE FRIEND OF MAN STANDS BETWEEN THE UNJUST JUSTICE OF THE ETERNAL FATHER AND THE RACE OF MORTALS
HE THAT IS ONCE ADMITTED TO THE RIGHT OF REASON IS MADE A FREEMAN OF THE WHOLE ESTATE WHAT PLATO HAS THOUGHT HE MAY THINK WHAT A SAINT HAS FELT HE MAY FEEL
MAN IS EXPLICABLE BY NOTHING LESS THAN ALL HIS HISTORY WITHOUT HURRY WITHOUT REST THE HUMAN SPIRIT GOES FORTH FROM THE BEGINNING TO EMBODY EVERY FACULTY
MERELY ECHOES TO HIM A SENTIMENT OF HIS INFANCY A PRAYER OF HIS YOUTH HE THEN PIERCES TO THE TRUTH THROUGH ALL THE CONFUSION OF TRADITION AND THE CARICATURE OF INSTITUTIONS RARE EXTRAVAGANT SPIRITS COME BY US AT INTERVALS
NEW PERILS TO VIRTUE HE LEARNS AGAIN WHAT MORAL VIGOR IS NEEDED TO SUPPLY THE GIRDLE OF A SUPERSTITION A GREAT LICENTIOUSNESS TREADS ON THE HEELS OF A REFORMATION
SIR WILLIAM ASHTON IS A MASK FOR A VULGAR TEMPTATION
THAT THEY HAVE NO FAIRER PAGE IN THEIR LIFE'S BOOK THAN THE DELICIOUS MEMORY OF SOME PASSAGES WHEREIN AFFECTION CONTRIVED TO GIVE A WITCHCRAFT SURPASSING THE DEEP ATTRACTION OF ITS OWN TRUTH TO A PARCEL OF ACCIDENTAL AND TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
OR HAS HEARD AN ELOQUENT TONGUE OR HAS SHARED THE THROB OF THOUSANDS IN A NATIONAL EXULTATION OR ALARM NO MAN CAN ANTEDATE HIS EXPERIENCE OR GUESS WHAT FACULTY OR FEELING A NEW OBJECT SHALL UNLOCK
MUST FASTEN THESE IMAGES TO SOME REALITY IN OUR SECRET EXPERIENCE OR WE SHALL LEARN NOTHING RIGHTLY WHAT BEFELL ASDRUBAL OR CAESAR BORGIA
STILL INDICATE THE GREEN WITHES THAT TIED THEM NO ONE CAN WALK IN A ROAD
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WITH NOTHING OF THE METAMORPHOSIS LEFT BUT THE LUNAR HORNS AS THE SPLENDID ORNAMENT OF HER BROWS THE IDENTITY OF HISTORY IS EQUALLY INTRINSIC THE DIVERSITY EQUALLY OBVIOUS
THEY COMBINE THE ENERGY OF MANHOOD WITH THE ENGAGING UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF CHILDHOOD THE ATTRACTION OF THESE MANNERS IS THAT THEY BELONG TO MAN AND ARE KNOWN TO EVERY MAN IN VIRTUE OF HIS BEING ONCE A CHILD
SHALL PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME WITH ALL THE ORNAMENT THAT TITLES OF NOBILITY COULD EVER ADD THE TRIVIAL EXPERIENCE OF EVERY DAY IS ALWAYS VERIFYING SOME OLD PREDICTION TO US AND CONVERTING INTO THINGS THE WORDS AND SIGNS
HIS OWN FORM AND FEATURES BY THEIR EXALTED INTELLIGENCE SHALL BE THAT VARIEGATED VEST
WHEN HE HAS SATISFIED HIMSELF IN GENERAL AND IN DETAIL THAT IT WAS MADE BY SUCH A PERSON AS HE SO ARMED AND SO MOTIVED
AND THEREFORE I KNOW I INCUR THE IMPUTATION OF UNNECESSARY HARDNESS AND STOICISM FROM THOSE WHO COMPOSE THE COURT AND PARLIAMENT OF LOVE BUT FROM THESE FORMIDABLE CENSORS I SHALL APPEAL TO MY SENIORS
THEIR OWN PIETY EXPLAINS EVERY FACT EVERY WORD HOW EASILY THESE OLD WORSHIPS OF MOSES OF ZOROASTER OF MENU OF SOCRATES DOMESTICATE THEMSELVES IN THE MIND I CANNOT FIND ANY ANTIQUITY IN THEM
BABYLON TROY TYRE PALESTINE AND EVEN EARLY ROME ARE PASSING ALREADY INTO FICTION THE GARDEN OF EDEN THE SUN STANDING STILL IN GIBEON
AND DO AS IT WERE RUN INTO ONE WHY SHOULD I MEASURE DEGREES OF LATITUDE WHY SHOULD I COUNT EGYPTIAN YEARS THE STUDENT INTERPRETS THE AGE OF CHIVALRY BY HIS OWN AGE OF CHIVALRY AND THE DAYS OF MARITIME ADVENTURE
HE IS THE COMPEND OF TIME HE IS ALSO THE CORRELATIVE OF NATURE
WILL YET SUPERINDUCE THE SAME SENTIMENT
BUT KNOW THAT HE IS GREATER THAN ALL THE GEOGRAPHY AND ALL THE GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD
HE HOLDS HER BOOKS TO HELP HER AND INSTANTLY IT SEEMS TO HIM AS IF SHE REMOVED HERSELF FROM HIM INFINITELY AND WAS A SACRED PRECINCT AMONG THE THRONG OF GIRLS HE RUNS RUDELY ENOUGH BUT ONE ALONE DISTANCES HIM
STILL BETRAY THE MOUNDS AND SUBTERRANEAN HOUSES OF THEIR FOREFATHERS
TRANSPORT HIM TO LARGE COUNTRIES DENSE POPULATION
OUR ADMIRATION OF THE ANTIQUE IS NOT ADMIRATION OF THE OLD BUT OF THE NATURAL
A MAN OF RUDE HEALTH AND FLOWING SPIRITS HAS THE FACULTY OF RAPID DOMESTICATION LIVES IN HIS WAGON AND ROAMS THROUGH ALL LATITUDES AS EASILY AS A CALMUC AT SEA OR IN THE FOREST OR IN THE SNOW HE SLEEPS AS WARM
NOT OF HIMSELF BUT MORE SWEET OF THAT CHARACTER HE SEEKS IN EVERY WORD THAT IS SAID CONCERNING CHARACTER YEA FURTHER IN EVERY FACT AND CIRCUMSTANCE
OF THAT WHICH IN GRAVE EARNEST THE MIND OF THAT PERIOD TOILED TO ACHIEVE MAGIC AND ALL THAT IS ASCRIBED TO IT
WHEN THE GODS COME AMONG MEN THEY ARE NOT KNOWN JESUS WAS NOT SOCRATES AND SHAKSPEARE WERE NOT ANTAEUS WAS SUFFOCATED BY THE GRIPE OF HERCULES BUT EVERY TIME HE TOUCHED HIS MOTHER EARTH HIS STRENGTH WAS RENEWED
OR DRAW A CHILD BY STUDYING THE OUTLINES OF ITS FORM MERELY
WHAT ELSE AM I WHO LAUGHED OR WEPT YESTERDAY WHO SLEPT LAST NIGHT LIKE A CORPSE
NEVER MIND I HAVE HEARD IT WOULD YOU OBJECT TO A THIRD EXCURSION THERE BEFORE MORNING
IT WAS DRAWING TO THE CLOSE OF AN ALMOST TROPICAL JUNE DAY THAT THE CROWD WHO HAD THRONGED THE PRECINCTS OF SAINT PAUL'S SINCE EARLY MORNING BEGAN TO DISPERSE
THAT ROYAL LADY SPREAD THE VELLUM ON HER KNEE TOOK THE PEN AND AFFIXED HER SIGNATURE AS COOLLY AS IF SHE WERE INDITING A SONNET IN AN ALBUM THEN HIS HIGHNESS WITH A FACE THAT FAIRLY SCINTILLATED WITH DEMONIAC DELIGHT STOOD UP AND FIXED HIS EYES ON THE GHASTLY PRISONER
AND THE MISERABLE EARL OF GLOUCESTER WITH A GASPING UNEARTHLY CRY FELL BACK IN THE ARMS OF THE ATTENDANTS DEAD AND OPPRESSIVE SILENCE REIGNED AND SIR NORMAN WHO HALF BELIEVED ALL ALONG THE WHOLE THING WAS A FARCE
THAT SINGULAR BEING I DON'T KNOW HER BUT I HAVE SEEN HER OFTEN WHY WAS PRUDENCE TALKING OF ME TO HER I WONDER THAT I DO NOT KNOW
THAT THAT FACE WAS UGLY HE DID NOT FOR AN INSTANT BELIEVE OR AT LEAST IT NEVER WOULD BE UGLY TO HIM WITH A FORM SO PERFECT A FORM A SYLPH MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
AND THEN ASK YOURSELF HOW SIR NORMAN HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF GOOD FAIRIES VISITING BRAVE KNIGHTS AND SETTING THEM FREE SIR NORMAN SMILED I AM AFRAID THE GOOD FAIRIES AND BRAVE KNIGHTS
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN DO NOTHING MORE FOR HIM NOTHING WHATEVER SIR
SOON OBTAINED THE ARTICLES NAMED AND STRUCK A LIGHT THE LADY WAS LEANING WEARILY AGAINST THE DOOR POST BUT NOW SHE CAME FORWARD AND DROPPED EXHAUSTED INTO THE DOWNY PILLOWS OF A LOUNGE IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU MADAME
WITH DIRECTIONS THAT THEY WERE TO BE GIVEN TO HER SISTERS AT HER DEATH
THE EXECUTIONER THREW A BLACK CLOTH OVER THE BLEEDING TRUNK AND HELD UP THE GRIZZLY HEAD BY THE HAIR AND SIR NORMAN COULD HAVE SWORN THE FEATURES MOVED AND THE DEAD EYES ROLLED ROUND THE ROOM
OF WHICH YOU SHALL HEAR ANON JUST NOW
BUT THERE ARE FEW WHO WOULD RISK INFECTION FOR THE SAKE OF A MERE STRANGER INSTEAD OF DOING AS YOU DID YOU MIGHT HAVE SENT ME TO THE PEST HOUSE YOU KNOW OH AS TO THAT ALL YOUR GRATITUDE IS DUE TO SIR NORMAN HE MANAGED THE WHOLE AFFAIR
TWICE HE OPENED HIS EYES TO REPLY AND TWICE ALL SOUNDS DIED AWAY IN A CHOKING GASP DO YOU HEAR HIS HIGHNESS SHARPLY INQUIRED THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR
YET THE COLD WHITE FACE WAS CONVULSED AS IF HE HAD DIED IN THROES OF AGONY
MIND LOVE CUT IN THE INEXORABLE DUKE
AS IT IS I KNOW WE ARE BEHIND TIME AND HIS MA THE COUNT I MEAN IS NOT ONE WHO IT ACCUSTOMED OR INCLINED TO BE KEPT WAITING I AM QUITE AT YOUR SERVICE NOW SAID SIR NORMAN SPRINGING ON HORSEBACK
GEORGE APPROACHED AND INTIMATED THAT SIR NORMAN WAS TO FOLLOW HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS MASTER AU REVOIR THEN SAID HUBERT
BEARING A STRONG FAMILY LIKENESS TO A DISSECTING TABLE UPON WHICH THE STARK FIGURE WAS LAID AND THE PEST CART DRIVER DISAPPEARED THE APOTHECARY HELD A MIRROR CLOSE TO THE FACE APPLIED HIS EAR TO THE PULSE AND HEART
THE DOOR OPENED A PUFF OF WIND EXTINGUISHED HIS CANDLE BUT NOT UNTIL HE HAD CAUGHT THE GLIMMER OF JEWELS THE SHINING OF GOLD AND THE FLUTTER OF LONG BLACK HAIR AND THEN SOME ONE CAME IN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
I SHOULD TAKE MY HAT MAKE HER A BOW AND GO DIRECTLY AND LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE MADE OF FLESH AND BLOOD INSTEAD OF CAST IRON YOU KNOW THE OLD SONG ORMISTON IF SHE BE NOT FAIR FOR ME WHAT CARE I HOW FAIR SHE BE
IF I HAVE TO SHOOT HIM MYSELF SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY STAND NEAR AND FEAR NOT AT HIS PERIL
AND SPOKE IN A VOICE THAT REVERBERATED LIKE THE TOLLING OF A DEATH BELL THROUGH THE ROOM MY LORD OF GLOUCESTER YOU HAVE BEEN TRIED BY A COUNCIL OF YOUR FELLOW PEERS PRESIDED OVER BY HER ROYAL SELF AND FOUND GUILTY OF HIGH TREASON
THE WET BRIDAL ROBES WERE DRENCHED AND DRIPPING ABOUT HER THE LONG DARK HAIR HUNG IN SATURATED MASSES OVER HER NECK AND ARMS AND CONTRASTED VIVIDLY WITH A FACE ORMISTON THOUGHT AT ONCE
MADAM YOU ARE TOO KIND SAID THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN LAYING HIS HAND ON HIS HEART WHILE ORMISTON SCOWLED DARKLY MORE ESPECIALLY AS I'VE THE MISFORTUNE TO BE A PERFECT STRANGER TO YOU NOT SO SIR NORMAN I HAVE KNOWN YOU THIS MANY A DAY
GOOD AND WHAT DO YOU CONFESS SAID THE DUKE BLANDLY LEANING FORWARD WHILE THE DWARF FELL BACK WITH A YELL OF LAUGHTER AT THE SUCCESS OF HIS RUSE I CONFESS ALL EVERYTHING ANYTHING ONLY SPARE MY LIFE DO
THE DWARF SKIPPED JAUNTILY AWAY TO GLOAT OVER HIS VICTIM HE REACHED THE DUNGEON DOOR WHICH THE GUARDS WITH SOME TREPIDATION IN THEIR COUNTENANCE AS THEY THOUGHT OF WHAT HIS HIGHNESS WOULD SAY WHEN HE FOUND HER MAJESTY LOCKED IN WITH THE PRISONER
AND ASSISTED HER THERE AS TENDERLY AS HE COULD HAVE DONE LA MASQUE HERSELF HE PAUSED ON THE THRESHOLD FOR THE ROOM WAS DARK THERE IS A LAMP AND A TINDER BOX ON THE MANTEL SAID THE FAINT SWEET VOICE
A BREATHLESS SILENCE FOLLOWED THE QUESTION EVERYBODY SEEMED TO HOLD HIS VERY BREATH TO LISTEN EVEN THE QUEEN LEANED FORWARD AND AWAITED THE ANSWER EAGERLY AND THE MANY EYES THAT HAD BEEN RIVETED ON SIR NORMAN SINCE HIS ENTRANCE
WHICH OF THEM INQUIRED HUBERT WITH PROVOKING GRAVITY IT WOULD BE MORE TO THE POINT IF YOU ASKED ME WHO THE OTHERS WERE I THINK SO I HAVE AND YOU MERELY ABUSED ME FOR IT BUT I THINK I KNOW ONE OF THEM WITHOUT BEING TOLD
AND I FEAR I MUST OWN THAT RUMOR DREW ME HITHER RESPONDED SIR NORMAN INVENTING A POLITE LITTLE WORK OF FICTION FOR THE OCCASION AND LET ME ADD THAT I CAME TO FIND THAT RUMOR HAD UNDER RATED INSTEAD OF EXAGGERATED HER MAJESTY'S SAID CHARMS HERE SIR NORMAN
AGAIN AT THE LADY AND LASTLY AT ORMISTON HIS HANDSOME COUNTENANCE FULL OF THE MOST UNMITIGATED WONDER TO WHOM ASKED ORMISTON WHO HAD VERY LITTLE NEED TO INQUIRE
I SHALL DRESS HIM UP IN LACE AND SILKS AND GEWGAWS AND HAVE A LEOLINE OF MY OWN ALREADY MADE ITS ORDER
AND AS THE PAGE SALAAMED AND WITHDREW HE TURNED ROUND AND GREETED SIR NORMAN WITH HIS SUAVEST AIR THE APPOINTED HOUR IS PASSED SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY BUT THAT IS PARTLY YOUR OWN FAULT
JUST STAND ASIDE THEN AND LET ME PASS THE ROOM HE ENTERED WAS SMALL SIMPLY FURNISHED AND SEEMED TO ANSWER AS BED CHAMBER AND STUDY ALL IN ONE
AND WHO IS THE OTHER HER NAME IS LA MASQUE
BOTH WERE TO BE HAD THE FORMER A HOLE IN THE WALL BEHIND THE SHOP THE LATTER A PALLID CADAVEROUS LOOKING PERSON WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO HAD BEEN DEAD A WEEK THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND ROSE AGAIN THERE WAS A LONG TABLE IN THE AFORESAID HOLE IN THE WALL
AND JAUNTY HAT SET SLIGHTLY ON ONE SIDE OF HIS HEAD WITH ITS LONG BLACK PLUME AND DIAMOND CLASP PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE SOMEBODY A PROFUSION OF SNOWY SHIRT FRILL RUSHED IMPETUOUSLY OUT OF HIS DOUBLET A BLACK VELVET CLOAK
WHERE IS SHE I TELL YOU REPEATED THE YOUNG MAN IN A FRENZY YOUR PATIENCE ONE MOMENT LONGER UNTIL WE SEE WHICH OF US HAS THE BEST RIGHT TO THE LADY I HAVE A PRIOR CLAIM A FORCED ONE LEOLINE DOES NOT CARE A SNAP FAR YOU
THE RAPID AND EXCITING EVENTS OF THE NIGHT HAD TURNED HIS HEAD INTO A MENTAL CHAOS
AND MY MASTER THE COUNT IS NOT ONE WHO BROOKS DELAY
WAS SOMETHING WONDERFUL IT BROUGHT HIS THOUGHTS BACK FROM HIMSELF AND HIS OWN FORTUNATE LOVE TO HIS VIOLENTLY SMITTEN FRIEND SIR NORMAN AND HIS PLAGUE STRICKEN BELOVED AND HE BEGAN SPECULATING WHAT HE COULD POSSIBLY BE ABOUT JUST THEN
SHE SET HER LAMP DOWN ON THE FLOOR AMONG THE RATS AND BEETLES AND STOOD WATCHING THE SMALL RED FLAME A MOMENT WITH A GLOOMY DOWNCAST EYE AND SIR NORMAN GAZING ON THE BEAUTIFUL DARKENING FACE SO LIKE AND YET SO UNLIKE LEOLINE
AND GLANCING AT THE LIFELESS FORM WITH A VERY PROFESSIONAL EYE WELL I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR ANOTHER ONE IN THE CART SO BEAR A HAND FRIEND AND LET US HAVE HIM OUT OF THIS
REASON STALKS GRAVELY NOT TO SAY SULKILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AND STANDING AFAR OFF
HER SISTER AND HAVE YOU DISCOVERED LEOLINE'S HISTORY I HAVE AND HER NAME AND HER NAME SHE IS LEOLINE DE MONTMORENCI AND WITH THE PROUDEST BLOOD OF FRANCE IN HER VEINS LIVING OBSCURE AND UNKNOWN
AND SIR NORMAN BECAME PROFOUNDLY SHOCKED SO MUCH SO THAT HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST AT THE DOOR THEN HE OPENED HIS LIPS TO ASK IN A SUBDUED TONE SHE HAS PREDICTED THE FUTURE FOR YOU WHAT DID SHE FORETELL
ARE YOU CASTING OFF THOSE ROPES TOM IS ALL CLEAR ALL BUT THE BOW AND STERN LINES YOU ATTEND TO THE BOW LINE AND I'LL GO TO THE STERN
GET A LAWYER AND HAVE TOM'S INTERESTS LOOKED AFTER MISTER SWIFT GLAD TO HAVE SOMEONE SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY WITH FELT SOMEWHAT BETTER WHEN A WELL KNOWN SHOPTON ATTORNEY ASSURED HIM THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST TOM WAS OF SUCH A FLIMSY CHARACTER
TO WHOM THEY WERE INDEBTED FOR MANY AUTOMOBILE AND MOTOR BOAT RIDES JUST WAIT ADVISED TOM WITH A TANTALIZING SMILE
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET A BREEZE IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THE RED CLOUD WOULD START FROM THE GROUND WITHOUT THE USE OF THE GAS SO AS TO MAKE THE MACHINES MORE EVEN AT THE SIGNAL OFF THEY STARTED THE MOTORS MAKING A GREAT RACKET
HIGHER AND HIGHER IT WENT AND THEN COMING TO A LEVEL KEEL THE CRAFT WAS SENT HERE AND THERE DARTING ABOUT LIKE A BIRD AND GOING ABOUT IN HUGE CIRCLES START THE GAS MACHINE AND WE'LL COME TO REST IN THE AIR SAID THE BALLOONIST AND TOM DID SO
UP TO SOME MISCHIEF I'LL WAGER COMMENTED NED HARK THEY'RE TALKING THE TWO LADS ON THE LOFT LISTENED INTENTLY THOUGH THE CRONIES ON THE GROUND BELOW THEM DID NOT SPEAK LOUDLY THEIR VOICES CAME PLAINLY TO THE LISTENERS
THERE DROVE INTO THE SWIFT YARD A DILAPIDATED WAGON DRAWN BY A BONY MULE
GOOD EXCLAIMED NED CHUCKLING GIVE ME A BROOM THERE'S ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU THE TWO LADS IN THE LOFT PEERED DOWN THE RED HEADED SQUINT EYED BULLY AND HIS CHUMS HAD THEIR KNIVES OUT AND WERE ABOUT TO CUT SOME OF THE IMPORTANT GUY WIRES
IF YOU DON'T LOOK OUT ANDY FOGER YOU'LL HAVE TROUBLE WITH ME AND AT NO VERY DISTANT DATE TOM WITH FLASHING EYES AND CLENCHED FISTS TOOK A STEP FORWARD ANDY SHRANK BACK DON'T BE AFRAID OF HIM ADVISED SAM WE'LL STAND BY YOU ANDY
AND AGAIN HE SPOKE AS IF HE HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS TOM CAME BACK AT HIM SHARPLY BUT AS EVERYONE WILL SOON KNOW I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU WE'RE BUILDING AN AIRSHIP
I'SE GWINE ON MAH WAY BUT DAT'S A POW'FUL FINE SHIP IT SUAH AM BETTER COME AND TRY A FLIGHT RAD ADDED MISTER DAMON I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU NO SAH AN I DOAN'T TAKE IT KIND
SO TOM AND MISTER SHARP HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH THE ONE RACE THEY WON THERE WERE OTHER CONTESTS AMONG MONOPLANES AND BIPLANES AND THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN WON TWO RACES
THE MONOPLANE HAD TO DESCEND FOR IT WAS IN DANGER OF TURNING TURTLE STILL THE NAVIGATOR WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP HE FLEW ALONG AT A LOWER LEVEL THEN MISTER SHARP OPENED UP THE RED CLOUD'S ENGINE AT FULL SPEED
DON'T YOU WANT TO COME AND TAKE A RIDE WITH US ME
WE'RE ON SOMETHING SOLID HE CRIED STAMPING HIS FEET A ROCK I GUESS
HE STARTED BACK IN ASTONISHMENT AT THE SIGHT OF THE THREE GROTESQUE FIGURES
WORK IN THAT DIRECTION WAS SUSPENDED FOR THE TIME BEING AND MORE ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE ENGINE THE PLANES AND RUDDERS SOME CHANGES WERE MADE AND A WEEK LATER THE RED CLOUD DEPARTED FOR BLAKEVILLE AS THE RULES OF THE CONTEST REQUIRED THREE PASSENGERS
AN AIRSHIP EXCLAIMED SAM AND PETE IN ONE BREATH AN AIRSHIP QUERIED ANDY AND THERE WAS A SNEER IN HIS VOICE WELL I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO IT TOM SWIFT YOU'LL NEVER BUILD AN AIRSHIP
UP INTO THE AIR SHOT THE NOSE OF THE RED CLOUD AS THE WIND STRUCK THE SLANTING SURFACE OF THE PLANES AND A MOMENT LATER IT WAS SAILING HIGH ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE THRONG THAT'S THE STUFF CRIED MISTER SHARP IT WORKS AS WELL THAT WAY AS IT DOES WITH THE GAS
AND THEN WAS SENT IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS TO THE NO SMALL DELIGHT OF A LARGE CROWD THAT GATHERED IN THE MEADOW BACK OF THE SWIFT PROPERTY FOR IT ONLY REQUIRED THE SIGHT OF THE AIRSHIP LOOMING ITS BULK ABOVE THE FENCE AND BUILDINGS TO ATTRACT A THRONG
REMOVED A MASS OF SOOT FROM HIS RIGHT CHEEK AND SHAKING HIS FIST WHICH WAS ALTERNATELY STRIPED RED AND BLACK CRIED OUT IN A RAGE I'LL GET EVEN WITH YOU YET TOM SWIFT YOU ONLY GOT WHAT WAS COMING TO YOU RETORTED THE YOUNG INVENTOR
TOM CALLED MISTER SHARP AS HE ENTERED THE CAR HAVING SEEN THAT EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT WE'LL NOT GO UP VERY FAR AT FIRST UNTIL MISTER DAMON GETS USED TO THE THIN AIR BLESS MY SOUL
AND IT WAS TOO STRONG THAT'S ALL AN ALUMINUM CONTAINER BLEW UP BUT NO PARTICULAR DAMAGE WAS DONE I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED HUMPH WHAT YOU MAKING ANYHOW DEMANDED ANDY
I BELIEVE I'M GETTING NERVOUS ANNOUNCED THE ECCENTRIC MAN BLESS MY LIVER BUT I HOPE NOTHING HAPPENS NOTHING WILL HAPPEN MISTER SHARP ASSURED HIM JUST KEEP CALM WHEN IT FEELS
AND YOU'RE SURE THEY WERE BURGLAR TOOLS ASKED THE CHIEF FOR HE DEPENDED ON ANDY TO BE HIS MOST IMPORTANT WITNESS
HAVING BEEN DELAYED ON THE TRIP BY A BROKEN COG WHEEL WHICH WAS MENDED IN MID AIR AS THE THREE NAVIGATORS APPROACHED THEY SAW A SMALL MACHINE FLYING AROUND THE GROUNDS LOOK CRIED NED EXCITEDLY WHAT A SMALL AIRSHIP
MAYBE WE CAN RIG UP ANOTHER CONTAINER MIX SOME FRESH GAS AND MAKE THE FINAL EXPERIMENT THIS AFTERNOON NOW DO BE CAREFUL CAUTIONED MISTER SWIFT THE AGED INVENTOR ONCE MORE
HE TRIED TO HIDE EM BUT ME AN SAM WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM HE WANTED TO LICK ME TOO
CHAPTER ONE AN EXPLOSION ARE YOU ALL READY TOM ALL READY MISTER SHARP REPLIED A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS STATIONED NEAR SOME COMPLICATED APPARATUS WHILE THE QUESTIONER A DARK MAN WITH A NERVOUS MANNER
FINALLY CONSENTED TO GO WITH HIS CHUM HE GOT A HALF HOLIDAY FROM THE BANK AND SHORTLY AFTER DINNER WENT TO TOM'S HOUSE COME ON OUT IN THE SHED AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE RED CLOUD PROPOSED THE YOUNG INVENTOR
I DON'T BET REPLIED TOM CALMLY BUT IF YOU WAIT A FEW WEEKS YOU'LL SEE ME IN AN AIRSHIP AND THEN
WHO TALKED IN SHORT SNAPPY SENTENCES WHICH HOWEVER SAID ALL HE MEANT THE FUMES OF THAT GAS AREN'T GOOD TO BREATHE WAIT UNTIL THEY HAVE BLOWN AWAY
DEADENED THE EXPLOSIONS OF THE POWERFUL MOTOR
THAT'S A MONOPLANE DECLARED TOM WHO WAS GETTING TO BE QUITE AN EXPERT YES THE SAME KIND THAT WAS USED TO CROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL INTERJECTED MISTER SHARP THEY'RE TOO UNCERTAIN FOR MY PURPOSES THOUGH THEY ARE ALL RIGHT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS
I'M ALL RIGHT BUT IT WAS TOUCH AND GO GOOD THING YOU HAD THE GAUGE ON OR WE'D NEVER HAVE KNOWN WHEN TO RUN WELL WE'VE MADE ANOTHER FAILURE OF IT AND THE MAN SPOKE SOMEWHAT BITTERLY
REJOINDER TO ANDY THAN MERE WORDS WHEN THE GATE OPENED AND MISTER SHARP STEPPED OUT THE FUMES HAVE ALL CLEARED AWAY TOM HE SAID WE CAN GO IN THE SHOP NOW
NOTED THAT THEIR HEIGHT WAS SEVEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH ENOUGH CALLED MISTER SHARP AND IT WAS TIME FOR MISTER DAMON
AS TOM PEERED OVER THE EDGE OF THE LITTLE RAISED LEDGE THERE FLASHED OUT BELOW HIM HUNDREDS OF ELECTRIC LIGHTS
WHY HE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED IT CAN'T BE TRUE JUST BEFORE HE LEFT MISTER DAMON YES WHAT DID HE DO ASKED THE CHIEF EAGERLY THINKING HE MIGHT SECURE SOME VALUABLE EVIDENCE I GUESS I'LL SAY NOTHING UNTIL I HAVE SEEN THE BANK PRESIDENT REPLIED MISTER SWIFT
WELL WE HAD ANOTHER EXPLOSION WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET THE RIGHT MIXTURE OF THE GAS BUT I THINK WE'VE HAD THE LAST OF OUR BAD LUCK WE'RE GOING TO TRY IT AGAIN UP TO NOW THE GAS HAS BEEN TOO STRONG THE TANK TOO WEAK
CHAPTER ELEVEN THE RED CLOUD DEPARTS WELL DAD I WISH YOU WERE GOING ALONG WITH US SAID TOM TO HIS FATHER NEXT MORNING YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO MISS
BUT I'LL WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT MANAGING THE SHIP BEFORE I VENTURE WITH HER IN IT IT WON'T DO TO HAVE ANY ACCIDENTS THEN THERE'S NED NEWTON TOO I MUST TAKE HIM FOR A SKIM IN THE CLOUDS GUESS I'LL INVITE HIM OVER SOME AFTERNOON
HE SHOUTED THEN AS THE TAILBOARD OF THE WAGON SWUNG PAST HIM HE REACHED OUT AND GRABBED IT PERHAPS HE THOUGHT HE COULD BRING THE RUNAWAY MULE UP STANDING BUT IF HE DID HE WAS GRIEVOUSLY DISAPPOINTED
I CAN'T GIVE THEM MY ATTENTION AND LOOK AFTER THE RUNNING OF THE MACHINERY I WAS GOING TO PROPOSE BRINGING A FRIEND OF MINE OVER TO SEE US MAKE THE TRIP TO MORROW WENT ON THE YOUNG INVENTOR NED NEWTON YOU KNOW HIM HE'D LIKE A RIDE OH I GUESS NED'S ALL RIGHT
LET'S POKE A HOLE IN THEIR GAS BAG PROPOSED SAM THAT WILL MAKE THEM THINK THEY'RE NOT SO SMART AS THEY PRETEND NAW WE CAN'T DO THAT ANSWERED ANDY WHY NOT DECLARED PETE BECAUSE THE BAG'S AWAY UP IN THE TOP PART OF THE SHED
IT IS A DEEP LAID SCHEME AND ESCAPING IN THE AIRSHIP IS PART OF IT I AM SORRY MISTER SWIFT THAT I HAVE TO BELIEVE YOUR SON AND HIS ACCOMPLICE GUILTY BUT I AM OBLIGED TO CHIEF YOU HAD BETTER SEND OUT A GENERAL ALARM THE AIRSHIP OUGHT TO BE EASY TO TRACE
TRIED TO DAMAGE THE AIRSHIP EH ASKED MISTER SHARP I WISH I'D CAUGHT THEM AT IT THE SCOUNDRELS BUT PERHAPS YOU HANDLED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD HAVE DONE I GUESS SO ASSENTED TOM I MUST SEE IF THEY DID CUT ANY OF THE WIRES BUT THE YOUNG INVENTOR AND HIS CHUM HAD ACTED TOO QUICKLY
NOW A VISITOR WILL FIND THAT NOT UNTIL AFTER SEVERAL DIFFERENT VISITS AND BY WALKING AND RIDING FOOT BY FOOT OVER THE HILLS CAN HE MAKE THEM FALL INTO LINE AS HE THINKS HE ONCE KNEW THEM
SO EXCELLENT WAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE OFFICERS AND SO READY THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN THAT THEY KEPT AN ALMOST PERFECT ALIGNMENT AS WAS SHOWN WHEN THE FINAL ORDER CAME TO CHARGE IN THE OPEN FIELDS
SAN JUAN HILL IS NOT A SOLITARY HILL BUT THE MOST PROMINENT OF A RIDGE OF HILLS WITH KETTLE HILL A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY ON THE EDGE OF THE JUNGLE AND SEPARATED FROM THE RIDGE BY A TINY LAKE IN THE LOCAL NOMENCLATURE
THE ROUGH RIDERS LEFT CAMP AT FIVE IN THE MORNING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HALF A DOZEN OFFICERS THEY WERE DISMOUNTED AND CARRIED THEIR BLANKET ROLLS HAVERSACKS AMMUNITION AND CARBINES
AND FIRED UPON BOTH BY THE BOERS AND BY THEIR OWN SHRAPNEL AND LYDDITE FOUR MEN WERE WOUNDED AND TO SAVE THEMSELVES A LINE OF THEM STOOD UP AT FULL LENGTH ON THE TRENCH AND CHEERED AND WAVED AT THE ARTILLERY
GENERAL WHEELER GUIDED BY THE CUBANS RECONNOITRED THIS TRAIL ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE AND WITH THE POSITION OF THE ENEMY FULLY EXPLAINED TO HIM RETURNED TO SIBONEY AND INFORMED GENERAL YOUNG AND COLONEL WOOD
AFTER THEATRICAL EFFECT AS THOUGH THEY WISHED TO FURNISH THE WAR CORRESPONDENTS WITH A CHANCE FOR DESCRIPTIVE WRITING WITH THE HORRORS OF WAR AS HORRIBLE AS THEY ARE WITHOUT ANY AID FROM THESE CONTRASTS
WAS TO SELL ME A PAIR OF BREECHES MADE OF PALM FIBRE WHICH CARLOS HAD WORN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TEN YEARS OF BATTLE
SOMETIMES THE MEN RISE AND FIRE AND THERE IS A FEVERISH FLUTTER OF MUSKETRY SOMETIMES THEY LIE MOTIONLESS FOR HOURS WHILE THE GUNS MAKE THE WAYS STRAIGHT ANY ONE WHO HAS SEEN EPSOM DOWNS ON A DERBY DAY WITH ITS THOUSANDS OF VANS AND TENTS AND LINES OF HORSES AND MOVING MOBS
HE HELD OFFICE FOR FULLY TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE BEGINNING THIS STORY THE READER MUST FORGET ALL HE MAY HAPPEN TO KNOW OF THIS PARTICULAR TRIUMPH OF THE PORTO RICAN EXPEDITION
BUT TIME AFTER TIME THEY ROSE AND STAGGERED FORWARD THROUGH THE HIGH GRASS
WHAT STRIKES YOU MOST IS THE BORED AIR OF THE TOMMIES THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST OF THE ENGINEERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PONTOON BRIDGE THE SOLICITUDE OF THE MEDICAL STAFF OVER THE LONG LINES OF WOUNDED
IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR WOOD AND ROOSEVELT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE CAPTAINS AND AFTER THE FIRST GENERAL ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM THEY RELIED UPON THE LATTER'S INTELLIGENCE TO PULL THEM THROUGH
AND ALTHOUGH FOR OVER A MILE OF THE WAY THE TRAIL WAS UNDER FIRE CRANE AND HARE EACH INSISTED ON GIVING ME AN ARM AND KEPT STEP WITH MY STUMBLINGS WHENEVER I PROTESTED AND REFUSED THEIR SACRIFICE AND POINTED OUT THE RISK THEY WERE TAKING THEY SMILED
HAD BEEN ABANDONED ALL ALONG ITS LENGTH IT LOOKED AS THOUGH A RETREATING ARMY HAD FLED ALONG IT RATHER THAN THAT ONE TROOP HAD FOUGHT ITS WAY THROUGH IT TO THE FRONT
AND BY ADVANCING THE WISCONSIN VOLUNTEERS THE CAVALRY HE SENT TO THE RIGHT TO CAPTURE LOS BANOS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK FROM WHERE THE MAIN BODY RESTED TWO MILES FROM COAMO WE COULD HEAR THE SIXTEENTH PENNSYLVANIA OPEN ITS ATTACK
WHITE RIDING BREECHES AND A COWBOY STETSON WITH NO INSIGNIA OF RANK NOT EVEN STRAPS
IT MAY THEN HAVE LOOKED LIKE A SUNNY NEW ENGLAND ORCHARD BUT BEFORE NIGHT FELL THE INTRENCHING TOOLS HAD LENT THOSE SUNNY SLOPES A FIERCE AND TERRIBLE ASPECT
THERE WAS NOT A FOOT OF FREE GROUND THE BUSHES SEEMED ABSOLUTELY IMPENETRABLE AS INDEED THEY WERE LATER FOUND TO BE WHEN WE HALTED THE MEN SAT
WHEN SHOT THROUGH THE BODY ASKED TO BE PROPPED UP AGAINST A TREE WITH HIS CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT BESIDE HIM AND THE LAST HIS TROOP SAW OF HIM HE WAS SEATED ALONE GRIMLY FIRING OVER THEIR HEADS
AND AS SPANISH TROOPS HATE BEING RUSHED AS A CAT HATES WATER THEY FIRED A FEW PARTING VOLLEYS AND BROKE AND RAN THE CHEERING HAD THE SAME INVIGORATING EFFECT ON OUR OWN SIDE AS A COLD SHOWER
THAT PROBABLY IS HOW MOST OF THE AMERICAN ARMY LAST SAW SAN JUAN HILL AND THAT PROBABLY IS HOW IT BEST REMEMBERS IT AS A FORTIFIED CAMP THAT WAS TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN I REVISITED IT
HE TOLD ME HE WAS THE ALCALDE AND THAT HE BEGGED TO SURRENDER INTO MY HANDS THE TOWN OF COAMO I LED HIM INSTANTLY TO ONE SIDE I WAS AFRAID THAT IF I DID NOT TAKE HIM UP HE WOULD SURRENDER TO PAGET OR TO JIMMY I BADE HIM CONDUCT ME TO HIS OFFICIAL RESIDENCE
THEY DID NOT SUSPECT THAT HE WOULD BECOME EVEN THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK CERTAINLY NOT THAT IN A FEW YEARS HE WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SO THEY SHOWED THEMSELVES TO HIM FRANKLY UNCONSCIOUSLY THEY CRITICISED ARGUED DISAGREED
WE REFUSED TO BELIEVE IT AND WHIPPED THE PONIES INTO GREATER HASTE WE WERE NOW ONLY A QUARTER OF A MILE DISTANT FROM THE BUILT UP PORTION OF COAMO WHERE THE ROAD TURNED SHARPLY INTO THE MAIN STREET OF THE TOWN CAPTAIN PAGET
A SHELL PASSES OVER THEM LIKE THE SHAKING OF MANY TELEGRAPH WIRES AND NEITHER OFFICER NOR TOMMY RAISES HIS HEAD TO WATCH IT STRIKE THEY ARE TIRED IN BODY AND IN MIND WITH CRAMPED LIMBS AND ACHING EYES THEY HAVE HAD TWELVE NIGHTS AND TWELVE DAYS OF BATTLE
EVEN THE WRITER OF THIS WHEN HE CABLED AN ACCOUNT OF THE EVENT TO HIS PAPER GAVE WITH EVERY ONE ELSE THE ENTIRE CREDIT TO GENERAL WILSON AND EVER SINCE HIS CONSCIENCE HAS UPBRAIDED HIM HIS ONLY CLAIM FOR TOLERANCE AS A WAR CORRESPONDENT
IT IS ONLY WHEN THE FIGURE ON THE STRETCHER LIES UNDER A BLANKET THAT THE TUMULT AND PUSH AND SWELTERING MASS COMES TO A QUICK PAUSE WHILE THE DEAD MAN'S COMRADE STANDS AT ATTENTION AND THE OFFICER RAISES HIS FINGERS TO HIS HELMET
AS AN EXCUSE TO GO TO LEAVE THE FIRING LINE I HAVE WATCHED OTHER FIGHTS WHERE THE MEN ENGAGED WERE QUITE WILLING TO UNSELFISHLY BEAR THE WOUNDED FROM THE ZONE OF DANGER
I HAD NEVER SEEN FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE SURRENDER TO ONE MAN
FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION COME THE SHELLS OF THE BOERS SEEKING OUT THE HIDDEN HOWITZERS THEY PASS SOMEWHAT HIGHER CRASHING INTO THE BASE OF THE KOPJE SOMETIMES KILLING SOMETIMES DIGGING THEIR OWN IGNOMINIOUS GRAVES THE STAFF REGARD THEM WITH THE SAME INDIFFERENCE
UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN I AGAIN MET YOUNG BORROWE GAYLY DISPORTING HIMSELF AT A LAWN TENNIS TOURNAMENT AT MATTAPOISETT I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HIS BROTHER'S METHOD OF REMOVING DYNAMITE WITH AN AXE HAD BEEN ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL HE SAID IT WORKED ALL RIGHT
THAT ONE WAS NOT SURE HE WAS ON THE RIGHT ROAD UNTIL HE SAW FROM THE CAR WINDOW THE ARMORED TRAIN STILL LYING ON THE EMBANKMENT THE GRAVES BESIDE IT AND THE DONGA INTO WHICH WINSTON CHURCHILL PULLED AND CARRIED THE WOUNDED
FOR THREE HOURS A SINGLE LINE OF MEN SLIPPED AND STUMBLED FORWARD ALONG THE MUDDY BANK OF THE RIVER AND FOR THREE HOURS THE ARTILLERY CRASHED SPLUTTERED AND STABBED AT THE THREE HILLS ABOVE THEM SCATTERING THE ROCKS AND BURSTING OVER AND BEHIND THE BOER TRENCHES ON THE CREST
BUT IF ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE STUPID ONES IT SEEMS A PITY THAT THE LANDMARKS OF SAN JUAN SHOULD NOT BE RESCUED FROM THE JUNGLE AND A FEW SIGN POSTS PLACED UPON THE HILLS IT IS TRUE THAT THE GREAT BATTLES OF THE CIVIL WAR AND THOSE OF THE ONE IN MANCHURIA
AS IS THEIR CUSTOM THE BOERS REMAINED INVISIBLE AND MADE NO REPLY AND THOUGH WE KNEW THEY WERE THERE IT SEEMED INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANYTHING HUMAN COULD LIVE UNDER SUCH A BOMBARDMENT OF SHOT BULLETS AND SHRAPNEL A HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT ON OUR RIGHT
WOOD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN ALONG IT LEADING HIS HORSE WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE OF USE IN CASE HE HAD TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ALTER HIS ORIGINAL FORMATION
IT WAS ONLY BY THE FIRING THAT HE COULD TELL WHERE HIS MEN LAY AND THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS ADVANCING THE ADVANCES WERE MADE IN QUICK DESPERATE RUSHES SOMETIMES THE GROUND GAINED
HE STOOD SO POINTING DOWN INTO THE TRENCH AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH WE COULD HEAR HIM CALLING UPON THE BOERS BEHIND IT TO SURRENDER A FEW MINUTES LATER THE LAST OF THE THREE HILLS WAS MOUNTED BY THE WEST YORKS WHO WERE MISTAKEN BY THEIR OWN ARTILLERY FOR BOERS
IT IS THE CONNING TOWER OF THE RELIEF COLUMN ONLY UNLIKE A CONNING TOWER IT OFFERS NO PROTECTION NO SECLUSION NO PEACE TO DAY COMMANDING GENERALS UNDER THE NEW CONDITIONS WHICH THIS WAR HAS DEVELOPED
ALONG THE TRAIL TO THE WEST WHICH WAS ON HIGH GROUND AND A HALF MILE TO A MILE DISTANT FROM THE TRAIL ALONG WHICH GENERAL YOUNG AND HIS REGULARS WERE MARCHING
THE OFFICER LOOKED AS THOUGH HE WOULD LIKE TO ARGUE HE WAS A WEST POINT GRADUATE AND A FULL FLEDGED CAPTAIN IN THE REGULAR ARMY TO HIM WOOD
THROUGH THE TWO HOURS OF FIGHTING THAT FOLLOWED ALTHOUGH MEN WERE FALLING ALL AROUND US THE SPANIARDS ON THE RIDGE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT MANY OF US SAW BUT THE FIRE AGAINST US WAS NOT MORE THAN EIGHTY YARDS AWAY
THERE WERE TWO GUIDES OLD CASANOVA
WHICH WERE BEING HURLED AT THE BEACH LIKE SLEDS DOWN A WATER CHUTE IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST WEIRD AND REMARKABLE SCENES OF THE WAR PROBABLY OF ANY WAR
WE HAD BEEN RIDING IN THIS PLEASANT FASHION FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF WITH BRIEF HALTS FOR REST WHEN WOOD STOPPED THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN AND RODE DOWN THE TRAIL TO MEET CAPRON WHO WAS COMING BACK
KETTLE HILL WHICH IS THE NAME GIVEN TO IT BY THE ROUGH RIDERS HAS ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN AS SAN JUAN HILL WITH AN ADDED NAME TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE OTHER SAN JUAN HILL OF GREATER RENOWN THE DAYS WE SPENT ON THOSE HILLS WERE SO RICH IN INCIDENT AND INTEREST AND WERE FILLED WITH MOMENTS OF SUCH EXCITEMENT
BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEVEN HOURS OF ONE DAY AND SIX DAYS IS CONSIDERABLE STILL AT PRESENT AT SAN JUAN THAT IS THE SORT OF INFORMATION UPON WHICH THE PATRIOTIC AND PUZZLED AMERICAN TOURIST IS FED YOUNG CASANOVA THE ONLY OTHER AUTHORITY IN SANTIAGO
ALL THROUGH THE LONG SUMMER PETER RABBIT WATCHED HIS FEATHERED FRIENDS
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN SAMMY JAY AND BLACKY THE CROW CREAKER CHUCKLED BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE AT ALL OFFENDED JUST THEN HE HEARD MISSUS CREAKER CALLING HIM AND WITH A HASTY
RETORTED PETER BUT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHO ROSEBREAST IS THE GROSBEAK OF COURSE STUPID SPUTTERED JENNY IF YOU DON'T KNOW ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK PETER RABBIT YOU CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND AND DEAF EVER SINCE YOU WERE BORN
THE WING WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE OH DEAR WHATEVER SHALL I DO PETER RABBIT
HE WASN'T AFRAID AND HE INTENDED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW IT ESPECIALLY REDTAIL IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS FEARLESSNESS THAT HE IS CALLED KINGBIRD ALL THE TIME HE WAS SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS CALLING REDTAIL A ROBBER AND EVERY OTHER BAD NAME HE COULD THINK OF
BUT EVEN HE MARVELLED AT THE WAY THOSE BIRDS PUT THE CHERRIES OUT OF SIGHT IT WAS QUITE CLEAR TO HIM WHY THEY ARE OFTEN CALLED CHERRYBIRDS IF THEY STAY LONG FARMER BROWN WON'T HAVE ANY CHERRIES LEFT REMARKED PETER DON'T WORRY REPLIED JENNY WREN
AND WITH THEM WERE NOTES OF SOUTHERN BIRDS WHOSE SONGS KITTY HAD LEARNED WHILE SPENDING THE WINTER IN THE SOUTH THEN THERE WERE NOTES ALL HIS OWN PETER LISTENED UNTIL THE SONG ENDED THEN SCAMPERED IN AMONG THE BUSHES AT ONCE THOSE HARSH CRIES BROKE OUT AGAIN
IT WAS TRUE CREAKER THE GRACKLE WITH THE SUN SHINING ON HIM WAS TRULY BEAUTIFUL HIS HEAD AND NECK HIS THROAT AND UPPER BREAST WERE A SHINING BLUE BLACK WHILE HIS BACK WAS A RICH SHINING BRASSY GREEN
THEY WON'T STAY LONG I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY EQUAL TO THEM FOR ROAMING ABOUT HERE ARE MOST OF US WITH FAMILIES ON OUR HANDS AND MISTER AND MISSUS BLUEBIRD WITH A SECOND FAMILY
EVERY FEW STEPS HE WOULD STOP TO PICK UP SOMETHING THEN STAND FOR A SECOND BOBBING UP AND DOWN IN THE FUNNIEST WAY AS IF HIS BODY WAS SO NICELY BALANCED ON HIS LEGS THAT IT TEETERED BACK AND FORTH LIKE A SEESAW
MAY I ASK YOU A VERY PERSONAL QUESTION CREAKER ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THEM UNLESS I WANT TO RETORTED CREAKER
I DO HOPE HE IS GOING TO STAY HERE AS I SAID BEFORE I DON'T OFTEN ENVY ANY ONE'S FINE CLOTHES BUT WHEN I SEE GLORY I'M SOMETIMES TEMPTED TO BE ENVIOUS IF I WERE MISSUS CARDINAL I'M AFRAID I SHOULD BE JEALOUS
AND SPREAD IT UNTIL IT WAS LIKE AN OPEN FAN ABOVE HIS BACK THE OUTER EDGE WAS GRAY THEN CAME A BROAD BAND OF BLACK FOLLOWED BY BANDS OF GRAY BROWN AND BLACK
BIRCH STUB AND HE AND MISSUS CHICKADEE SPENT THEIR TIME FLITTING ABOUT HITHER THITHER AND YON SPREADING GOOD CHEER EVERY TIME PETER VISITED THE OLD ORCHARD HE FOUND HIM THERE AND AS TOMMY WAS ALWAYS READY FOR A BIT OF MERRY GOSSIP
I'VE NOTICED SAID PETER THAT BIRDS WHO DO NOT SING AT ANY OTHER TIME OF YEAR SING IN THE SPRING DO YOU HAVE A SPRING SONG TOMMY TIT WELL I DON'T KNOW AS YOU WOULD CALL IT A SONG PETER CHUCKLED TOMMY
AT THAT VERY INSTANT A GREAT RACKET BROKE OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OLD ORCHARD AND IN NO TIME AT ALL THE FEATHERED FOLKS WERE HURRYING FROM EVERY DIRECTION SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES
PETER LOOKED A LITTLE PUZZLED I
HE SCARED ME FOR A SECOND THEN YOU ARE EVEN SAID A VOICE CLOSE AT HAND YOU SCARED HIM I SAW YOU COMING BUT LONGBILL DIDN'T PETER TURNED QUICKLY THERE WAS MISSUS WOODCOCK PEEPING AT HIM FROM BEHIND A TUSSOCK OF GRASS
THEY WILL EAT MORE OF FARMER BROWN'S GRAIN THAN THEY WILL PAY FOR BY THE WORMS AND BUGS THEY DESTROY HELLO THERE'S DANDY THE WAXWING AND HIS FRIENDS A FLOCK OF MODESTLY DRESSED YET RATHER DISTINGUISHED LOOKING FEATHERED FOLKS
HIS REDDISH BROWN WINGS
AS HE DREW NEARER TO IT IT SOUNDED LOUDER AND LOUDER PRESENTLY PETER STOPPED TO TRY TO LOCATE EXACTLY THE PLACE WHERE THAT SOUND WHICH NOW WAS MORE THAN EVER LIKE THUNDER WAS COMING FROM
IT WAS THOSE FAST MOVING WINGS THAT MADE THE THUNDER IT WAS SO LOUD THAT PETER ALMOST WANTED TO STOP HIS EARS WHEN IT ENDED
BUT MOST OF ALL PETER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT QUEER REQUEST OF CRESTY'S AND A DOZEN TIMES THAT DAY HE FOUND HIMSELF PEEPING UNDER OLD LOGS IN THE HOPE OF FINDING A CAST OFF COAT OF MISTER BLACK SNAKE
HIS THROAT AND BREAST WERE GRAY SHADING INTO BRIGHT YELLOW UNDERNEATH HIS BACK AND HEAD WERE OF A GRAYISH BROWN WITH A TINT OF OLIVE GREEN A POINTED CAP WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO MAKE HIM QUITE DISTINGUISHED LOOKING
PRESENTLY THE STRANGER FLEW UP IN A TREE AND PETER SAW THAT HIS TAIL WAS LITTLE MORE THAN HALF AS LONG AS THAT OF CREAKER AT ONCE IT CAME OVER PETER THAT THIS WAS A STRANGER TO HIM AND OF COURSE HIS CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED
FOR GOODNESS SAKE PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHOSE VOICE THAT IS SHE CRIED THAT'S ROSEBREAST HE AND MISSUS ROSEBREAST HAVE BEEN HERE FOR QUITE A LITTLE WHILE
AND HE STOPPED FLUTTERING AND SIMPLY LAY PANTING OH PETER HE GASPED YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GLAD I AM THAT IT IS ONLY YOU I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM TO DO
IT WAS NOT LOUD BUT IT WAS CHARMING IT CONTAINED THE CLEAR WHISTLE OF GLORY AND THERE WAS EVEN THE TINKLE OF LITTLE FRIEND THE SONG SPARROW THE NOTES OF OTHER FRIENDS WERE IN THAT SONG
ALL SUMMER LONG THEY WERE GOING TO SCHOOL ALL ABOUT HIM LEARNING HOW TO WATCH OUT FOR DANGER TO USE THEIR EYES AND EARS AND ALL THE THINGS A BIRD MUST KNOW WHO WOULD LIVE TO GROW UP
WHILE THESE WORMS WERE SO DEEP IN THE EARTH THAT PETER COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE THERE
JUST AS HE WAS LEAVING THE FAR CORNER OF THE OLD ORCHARD SOME ONE CALLED HIM PETER OH PETER RABBIT CALLED THE VOICE PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY SAT UP VERY STRAIGHT LOOKED THIS WAY LOOKED THAT WAY AND LOOKED THE OTHER WAY
HE WILL KEEP THE COLD OUT AND I'VE FOUND THAT IF A FELLOW USES HIS EYES AND ISN'T AFRAID OF A LITTLE WORK HE CAN FIND PLENTY TO EAT AT LEAST I CAN THE ONLY TIME I EVER GET REALLY WORRIED IS WHEN THE TREES ARE COVERED WITH ICE
HE WAS WALKING ABOUT ON THE GROUND SOME DISTANCE OFF HE DIDN'T HOP BUT WALKED AND AT THAT DISTANCE HE LOOKED ALL BLACK
HE FEEDS THE SAME WAY I DO ONLY HE LIKES MARSHY MEADOWS INSTEAD OF BRUSHY SWAMPS PERHAPS YOU KNOW HIM PETER NODDED I DO SAID HE NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT THERE IS A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ALTHOUGH I HADN'T THOUGHT OF HIM AS A RELATIVE OF YOURS BEFORE
HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE BLACKY THE CROW THAT I SUPPOSE THIS IS WHY THEY CALL HIM CROW BLACKBIRD
LONGBILL SUDDENLY THRUST HIS BILL STRAIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF HIM AND TO PETER'S ASTONISHMENT HE LIFTED THE END OF THE UPPER HALF WITHOUT OPENING THE REST OF HIS BILL AT ALL THAT'S THE WAY I GET THEM SAID HE
I AM GLAD IT IS NO ONE BUT YOU PETER FOR I WAS HAVING A SPLENDID MEAL HERE AND I SHOULD HAVE HATED TO LEAVE IT YOU'LL EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO ON EATING I HOPE WE CAN TALK BETWEEN BITES
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY HONEY IF I DID
YOU'RE MISTAKEN PETER SAID HE THIS ISN'T HOME I'VE SIMPLY COME DOWN HERE FOR THE WINTER YOU KNOW HOME IS WHERE YOU RAISE YOUR CHILDREN AND MY HOME IS IN THE GREAT WOODS FARTHER NORTH
EACH TOE HAS A SHARP CLAW WHEN I GO UP A TREE THE THREE FRONT CLAWS ON EACH FOOT HOOK INTO THE BARK
THE OLDER IT IS THE BETTER IT SUITS ME BUT THE WOODPECKERS SEEM TO LIKE NEW HOUSES BEST WHICH AS I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US
BUT IF HE COULDN'T SEE THE FLY HE COULD HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF SCRAPPER'S BILL AND HE KNEW BY THE WAY SCRAPPER KEPT OPENING AND SHUTTING HIS MOUTH AFTER HIS RETURN THAT HE HAD CAUGHT THAT FLY AND IT HAD TASTED GOOD
IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE THE LEAST DIFFERENCE TO TOMMY WHETHER HE WAS RIGHT SIDE UP OR UPSIDE DOWN HE WAS A LITTLE ANIMATED BUNCH OF BLACK AND WHITE FEATHERS NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN JENNY WREN THE TOP OF HIS HEAD BACK OF HIS NECK AND COAT WERE SHINING BLACK
AND NOW OUR FAMILY IS VERY WELL REPRESENTED IN THE OLD ORCHARD SAID CHEBEC PROUDLY SLOWLY PETER REACHED OVER HIS BACK WITH HIS LONG LEFT HIND FOOT AND THOUGHTFULLY SCRATCHED HIS LONG RIGHT EAR
HIS WAY OF CLIMBING THAT TREE WAS VERY LIKE CREEPING AND PETER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT SEEP SEEP WAS WELL NAMED THE BROWN CREEPER HE KNEW IT WAS QUITE USELESS TO TRY TO GET SEEP SEEP TO TALK HE KNEW THAT SEEP SEEP WOULDN'T WASTE ANY TIME THAT WAY
NO ONE WITH ANY EYES AT ALL COULD HAVE HELPED SEEING HIM BECAUSE OF THAT WONDERFUL SCARLET COAT HE SAW TOO BY THE WAY REDCOAT WAS ACTING THAT HE WAS IN GREAT TROUBLE AS FARMER BROWN'S BOY DREW NEAR AND REDCOAT SAW THAT HE WAS DISCOVERED
FOR MANY OF THEM HAD GIVEN THEIR WORD AT THE WINTER PALACE NOT TO TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE PEOPLE WILLIAMS OFFERED TO MEDIATE IF ANTONOV WERE RELEASED THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY DONE ANTONOV AND WILLIAMS MADE SPEECHES TO THE VICTORIOUS SAILORS INFLAMED BY THEIR MANY DEAD
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD IT IS NOT EASY FOR US RUSSIANS POLITICS YOU AMERICANS ARE BORN POLITICIANS YOU HAVE HAD POLITICS ALL YOUR LIVES BUT FOR US WELL IT HAS ONLY BEEN A YEAR YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK OF KERENSKY I ASKED
BUT LENIN WON'T GET GERMANY TO MAKE PEACE CRIED ONE A VIOLENT YOUNG SOLDIER REPLIED AND WHOSE FAULT IS IT YOUR DAMN KERENSKY DIRTY BOURGEOIS TO HELL WITH KERENSKY WE DON'T WANT HIM WE WANT LENIN
IN THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN THE SNOW PILED STREETS WERE QUIET WITH THE STILLNESS OF CONVALESCENCE ONLY A FEW ARC LIGHTS WERE BURNING ONLY A FEW PEDESTRIANS HURRIED ALONG THE SIDE WALKS AN ICY WIND BLEW FROM THE GREAT PLAIN
THE MOMENT IS DECISIVE EVERYBODY MUST COOPERATE WITH THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE REPORT WHERE THERE ARE STORES OF BARBED WIRE BENZINE GUNS WE'VE WON THE POWER NOW WE MUST KEEP IT THE MENSHEVIK YOFFE TRIED TO READ HIS PARTY'S DECLARATION
THE PETTY BOURGEOISIE IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS WOULD COMBINE WITH THE DEVIL HIMSELF HE SAID ONCE
AND ONCE MORE THE YUNKERS WENT FREE ALL BUT A FEW WHO IN THEIR PANIC TRIED TO FLEE OVER THE ROOFS OR TO HIDE IN THE ATTIC AND WERE FOUND AND HURLED INTO THE STREET TIRED BLOODY TRIUMPHANT THE SAILORS AND WORKERS SWARMED INTO THE SWITCHBOARD ROOM
ALSO MORTALLY STRICKEN WHO NEVERTHELESS WOULD RETURN AND POUR OUT HIS BEAUTIFUL ELOQUENCE FOR A LOST CAUSE GOTZ SAT THERE DAN LIEBER BOGDANOV BROIDO FILLIPOVSKY
THE RESULT DEPENDS UPON PETROGRAD AT THE FRONT THE DECREES ON PEACE AND LAND ARE PROVOKING GREAT ENTHUSIASM KERENSKY IS FLOODING THE TRENCHES WITH TALES OF PETROGRAD BURNING AND BLOODY OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN MASSACRED BY THE BOLSHEVIKI BUT NO ONE BELIEVES HIM
AFTER CIRCULATING ABOUT THE CITY
OUR COALITION IS THAT OF THE PROLETARIAT AND THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY WITH THE POOR PEASANTS
CHAPTER FOUR THE FALL OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER SEVENTH I ROSE VERY LATE THE NOON CANNON BOOMED FROM PETER PAUL AS I WENT DOWN THE NEVSKY IT WAS A RAW CHILL DAY
THE CHURCH OF VASILI BLAZHEINY LOOMED FANTASTIC ITS BRIGHT COLOURED CONVOLUTED AND BLAZONED CUPOLAS VAGUE IN THE DARKNESS THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY DAMAGE
THEY DO NOT DARE TO FIGHT THEY ARE COWARDS BUT IF WE SHOULD BE OVERPOWERED WELL EVERY MAN KEEPS ONE BULLET FOR HIMSELF AT THIS POINT THERE WAS A BURST OF RIFLE FIRE NOT FAR OFF OUT ON THE SQUARE
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PARQUETTED FLOOR LAY ROWS OF DIRTY MATTRESSES AND BLANKETS UPON WHICH OCCASIONAL SOLDIERS WERE STRETCHED OUT EVERYWHERE WAS A LITTER OF CIGARETTE BUTTS BITS OF BREAD CLOTH AND
HAS BEEN ANTICIPATED BY THE RISING OF THE PETROGRAD WORKERS AND SOLDIERS SO WE CAME INTO THE GREAT MEETING HALL PUSHING THROUGH THE CLAMOROUS MOB AT THE DOOR IN THE ROWS OF SEATS UNDER THE WHITE CHANDELIERS
WHEN HE COULD BE HEARD AGAIN LET'S MAKE AN END OF THIS ADVENTURE IN PETROGRAD
HENDELMAN FOR THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES COULD BE HEARD PROTESTING AGAINST THE BOMBARDMENT OF THE WINTER PALACE WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS KIND OF ANARCHY SCARCELY HAD HE STEPPED DOWN THAN A YOUNG LEAN FACED SOLDIER
THE COUNTRY AND THE ARMY ARE THREATENED WITH FAMINE TO FIGHT AGAINST IT THE REGULAR FUNCTIONING OF ALL SERVICES IS INDISPENSABLE THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT IS TAKING EVERY MEASURE TO ASSURE THE COUNTRY AND THE ARMY
IN WIDE SPREADING RIPPLES NEWS OF THE MIRACLE SPREAD OVER THE FACE OF THE LAND AND IN ITS WAKE TOWNS CITIES AND FAR VILLAGES STIRRED AND BROKE SOVIETS AND MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES AGAINST DUMAS ZEMSTVOS
BY FORCE TO TAKE OVER THE INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT REVOLUTIONARY ORDER REVOLUTIONARY DISCIPLINE
HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD THE BARINI WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND A ROOM IN ANY HOTEL HE SAID BUT I'LL TAKE YOU AROUND FOR A HUNDRED RUBLES
HE WAS REELING FROM THREE NIGHTS SLEEPLESS WORK ON THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ON THE PLATFORM SAT THE LEADERS OF THE OLD TSAY EE KAH FOR THE LAST TIME DOMINATING THE TURBULENT SOVIETS WHICH THEY HAD RULED FROM THE FIRST DAYS
AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING HE SENT WORD TO THE SECOND TSARSKOYE SELO RIFLES TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS THE SOLDIERS REPLIED THAT THEY WOULD REMAIN NEUTRAL BUT WOULD NOT DISARM KERENSKY GAVE THEM TEN MINUTES IN WHICH TO OBEY
WE DEMAND THAT KERENSKY BE ARRESTED AND THAT HE BE ORDERED IN THE NAME OF THE ORGANISATIONS HEREINAFTER MENTIONED
WORMING OUR WAY THROUGH THE PACKED AND NOISY AISLE A GOOD NATURED CROWD BEARING THE DISCOMFORT WITH HUMOROUS PATIENCE
KAMENIEV ANSWERED DISCREETLY
THEY WILL NEVER DARE FIRE ON YOU THERE HE SAID ONE GARRISON REGIMENT BADLY DEMORALISED BY LONG INACTIVITY HAD BEEN APPROACHED BY BOTH SIDES
AND BY EXECUTIVE ORDER THE WINE CELLARS WERE INVADED BY COMMITTEES WITH HATCHETS WHO SMASHED THE BOTTLES OR BLEW THEM UP WITH DYNAMITE COMPANIES OF RED GUARDS
WHO SAID THAT THE MEN WERE HOLDING HUGE MASS MEETINGS CONDEMNING THE ACTION OF THEIR LEADERS ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS HE CRIED POUNDING ON THE TABLE THE OBORONTSI IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ARE PLAYING KORNILOV'S GAME THEY TRIED TO SEND A MISSION TO THE STAVKA
AND THERE SEEMED EVEN LESS UNEASINESS AMONG THE STREET CROWDS THAN THERE HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE A WHOLE CROP OF NEW APPEALS AGAINST INSURRECTION HAD BLOSSOMED OUT ON THE WALLS DURING THE NIGHT TO THE PEASANTS TO THE SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT TO THE WORKMEN OF PETROGRAD
THAT SAME DAY THE WHITE GUARDS AND YUNKERS IN THE KREMLIN SURRENDERED AND WERE ALLOWED TO MARCH OUT UNHARMED THE TREATY OF PEACE FOLLOWS ONE THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY
MOUNTAINS OF DIRT AND ROCK WERE PILED HIGH NEAR THE BASE OF THE WALL CLIMBING THESE WE LOOKED DOWN INTO TWO MASSIVE PITS TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET DEEP AND FIFTY YARDS LONG WHERE HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS AND WORKERS WERE DIGGING IN THE LIGHT OF HUGE FIRES
WITHOUT TAKING OFFENCE THE OFFICER REPLIED YES I KNOW BUT WHAT CAN WE DO HE SHRUGGED
ALL OTHERS ARE SURRENDERED BY THE YUNKERS
WE WALKED BACK UP TO THE RED ARCH WHERE A KNOT OF SOLDIERS WAS GATHERED STARING AT THE BRIGHTLY LIGHTED WINTER PALACE AND TALKING IN LOUD TONES NO COMRADES ONE WAS SAYING HOW CAN WE SHOOT AT THEM
SHOUTS AND STAMPING ALWAYS GROWING MORE VIOLENT THE ARMY DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HAS THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY SOLDIERS BEGAN TO STAND UP ALL OVER THE HALL WHO ARE YOU SPEAKING FOR WHAT DO YOU REPRESENT
I'M GOING NOW ANSWERED TROTZKY AND LEFT THE PLATFORM HIS FACE A LITTLE PALER THAN USUAL HE PASSED DOWN THE SIDE OF THE ROOM SURROUNDED BY EAGER FRIENDS AND HURRIED OUT TO THE WAITING AUTOMOBILE KAMENIEV NOW SPOKE
OVER DRESSED FASHION APING LITTLE GIRLS WITH PINCHED FACES AND LEAKY SHOES GIRL AFTER GIRL FLUSHING WITH PLEASURE AT THE APPLAUSE OF THE NICE PEOPLE OF PETROGRAD OF THE OFFICERS THE RICH THE GREAT NAMES OF POLITICS
AS YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICER AND AS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC I DEMAND TO BE ALLOWED TO PASS THE GUARD SCRATCHED HIS HEAD LOOKING UNEASILY OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE
YOU CONSIDER IT WON THEN HE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS THERE IS MUCH TO DO HORRIBLY MUCH IT IS JUST BEGINNING ON THE LANDING I MET RIAZANOV
AT THE WESTERN CORNER OF THE PALACE LAY A BIG ARMOURED CAR WITH A RED FLAG FLYING FROM IT NEWLY LETTERED IN RED PAINT S R S D SOVIET RABOTCHIKH SOLDATSKIKH DEPUTATOV
THE MENSHEVIK GOMBERG AND THREE OR FOUR REPORTERS THEY WERE ALL IN HIGH SPIRITS SEE THEY SAID THE COWARDS ARE AFRAID OF US THEY DON'T DARE ARREST THE DUMA THEIR MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DOESN'T DARE TO SEND A COMMISSAR INTO THIS BUILDING
ALONG ONE SIDE OF THE SQUARE THE DARK TOWERS AND WALLS OF THE KREMLIN STOOD UP ON THE HIGH WALLS FLICKERED REDLY THE LIGHT OF HIDDEN FLAMES VOICES REACHED US ACROSS THE IMMENSE PLACE AND THE SOUND OF PICKS AND SHOVELS WE CROSSED OVER
THAT IS WHY I AM LEAVING THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS I FULLY REALISE THE GRAVITY OF THIS DECISION BUT I CAN BEAR NO MORE
AND FINALLY THE BOLSHEVIKI PROMISE THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE AWAY OUR LAND THERE IS NO DANGER TO US WE REMAIN NEUTRAL DURING THIS TALK PEOPLE WERE CONSTANTLY ENTERING AND LEAVING MOST OF THEM OFFICERS THEIR SHOULDER STRAPS TORN OFF
THE RESPONSE FROM THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS LIKE A BLAST OF HOT STORM THE INSURGENTS NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO SAY OPENLY THEIR OPINION TO THE MASSES OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS UPON THE TSAY EE KAH ROLLED IN LIKE BREAKERS THE FIERCE POPULAR CONDEMNATION OF THE DESERTERS
IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC IN THE GENERAL TURMOIL ATTENDING THE CONQUEST OF THE CITY THE CHIEF RAILWAY STATION HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BY THE VICTORS NOT A CAB IN SIGHT
IN A BALLOON HOPING TO CATCH HER IF SHE COULD ESCAPE MAGOG THUS THE ANIMAL WAS SURROUNDED ON EVERY SIDE AND AT FIRST WAS VERY MUCH TERRIFIED KNOWING NOT WHICH WAY SHE HAD BEST TO GO
I THEN FLUNG MYSELF INTO THE SEA AND THEY THREW OUT A ROPE BY WHICH I WAS TAKEN ON BOARD I NOW INQUIRED WHERE WE WERE AND WAS INFORMED IN THE GREAT SOUTHERN OCEAN THIS OPENED A DISCOVERY WHICH REMOVED ALL MY DOUBTS AND DIFFICULTIES
THE BARON MAKES A SPEECH TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND DRIVES OUT ALL THE MEMBERS ROUTS THE FISHWOMEN AND THE NATIONAL GUARDS PURSUES THE WHOLE ROUT INTO A CHURCH
WHEN WE BEGAN TO OBSERVE AN AMAZING CHANGE IN EVERYTHING ABOUT US OUR SPIRITS BECAME LIGHT OUR NOSES WERE REGALED WITH THE MOST AROMATIC EFFLUVIA IMAGINABLE THE SEA HAD ALSO CHANGED ITS COMPLEXION AND FROM GREEN BECAME WHITE
CORSELET OF STEEL WITH GAUNTLETS HELMET AND C SO AS NEARLY TO RESEMBLE A MOLE HE INSTANTLY PLUNGED INTO THE EARTH MAKING WAY WITH HIS SHARP STEEL HEAD PIECE AND TEARING UP THE GROUND WITH HIS IRON CLAWS
O'ER ALL THE CROWD CONTENDING
AND OF SUCH GENTLE ASCENT THAT A REGIMENT OF CAVALRY WITH A TRAIN OF CANNON COULD ASCEND WITH PERFECT EASE AND FACILITY IT SEEMED LIKE A RAINBOW IN THE HEAVENS THE BASE OF WHICH APPEARED TO RISE IN THE CENTRE OF AFRICA
ON WHICH THE INFLAMMABLE AIR RUSHED OUT WITH GREAT FORCE AND THE ROYAL GEORGE DESCENDED LIKE A FALLING STAR INTO THE VERY SPOT FROM WHENCE SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN THERE SHE STILL REMAINS
I FOUND IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SEW UP THEIR MOUTHS SO THAT BETWEEN THE BLIND JUDGES AND THE DUMB MATRONS METHOUGHT THE TRIAL HAD A CHANCE OF BEING TERMINATED SOONER THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD
AND OPPOSITE TO THESE WERE PLACED ONE HUNDRED JUDGES WITH CURLY WHITE WIGS FLOWING DOWN ON EACH SIDE OF THEM TO THEIR VERY FEET SO THAT SOLOMON IN ALL HIS GLORY WAS NOT SO WISE IN APPEARANCE
HIGH TOPPED WITH AIRY BLADDERS BY A STRING DEPENDENT HAD NOT STORMED AGAINST HIS LORDSHIP
CARRYING THEIR HEADS AT THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR TAILS I CROSSED CONTINUED HE ONE PRODIGIOUS RANGE OF ROCKS EQUAL IN HEIGHT TO THE ALPS THE TOPS OR HIGHEST PARTS OF THESE MARINE MOUNTAINS
AND AS THE NATIVES HAVE EVER EXPRESSED THEIR AVERSION TO ALL MANNER OF EUROPEAN EATABLES IT IS HEREBY STRICTLY FORBIDDEN UNDER PAIN OF THE SEVEREST PENALTIES FOR ANY OF THE OFFICERS CHARGED WITH THE KEEPING OF THE SAID FUDGE TO GIVE
ONE TIME IT WOULD BE AT THAT PART OF THE HEAVENS UNDER MY FEET AND IN THE NEXT MINUTE WOULD BE OVER MY HEAD IT WAS NEVER AT REST BUT FOR EVER GOING EAST WEST NORTH OR SOUTH AND PAID NO MORE RESPECT TO THE DIFFERENT WORLDS THAN IF THEY WERE SO MANY LANTERNS WITHOUT REFLECTORS
THINK OF WHAT SUPERIOR BENEFIT TO MANKIND IS OUR PRESENT UNDERTAKING PERSEVERE AND FORTUNE WILL SECOND YOUR ENDEAVOURS REMEMBER IT IS MUNCHAUSEN WHO LEADS YOU ON AND BE CONVINCED OF SUCCESS
AND A PRODIGIOUS CROWD OF NOBILITY AND PLACED SITTING UPON THE SUMMIT OF THE WHALE'S BONES AT THE PALACE AND HAVING REMAINED IN THIS SITUATION FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS AS A TRIAL ORDEAL
TO THE EXTREMITY OF WHICH WAS FASTENED A CORD OF ABOUT TWO FEET IN LENGTH AND TO THE END OF THE CORD WAS FASTENED A BALL OF IRON WITH SPIKES SHOOTING FROM IT LIKE THE RAYS OF A STAR WITH THIS WEAPON HE PREPARED TO ENCOUNTER AND ADVANCING THUS HE SPOKE
THEREFORE I HAD NO INCLINATION TO PROLONG THE TIME ADD TO THIS MY SITUATION WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS VERY UNPLEASANT I MET MANY LARGE FISH WHO WERE IF I COULD JUDGE BY THEIR OPEN MOUTHS
SOME TIME AFTER I ORDERED THE FOLLOWING PROCLAMATION TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE COURT GAZETTE AND IN ALL THE OTHER PAPERS OF THE EMPIRE
GOOD MY FRIENDS AND WARRIORS HEADLONG ON THE FOE BEAR DOWN IMPETUOUS HE SPOKE AND WAVING HIGH THE MIGHTY ROD TIPPED WONDERFUL EACH BULL AT WHICH MORE FIERCE THE CREATURES BELLOWED
HE ALSO PLACED REFRESHMENTS BEFORE ME PARTICULARLY NECTAR AND OTHER RICH WINES SUCH AS THE GODS AND GODDESSES ONLY ASPIRE TO AFTER THIS REPAST WAS OVER VULCAN ORDERED VENUS TO SHOW ME EVERY INDULGENCE WHICH MY SITUATION REQUIRED
WHO WAS FULMINATING AGAINST THE ARISTOCRATS AND TAKING THE CREATURE BY ONE LEG FLUNG HIM AT THE PRESIDENT I LAID ABOUT ME MOST NOBLY DROVE THEM ALL OUT OF THE HOUSE AND LOCKING THE DOORS PUT THE KEY IN MY POCKET
SHE FLEW TO THE RIGHT THEN TO THE LEFT NORTH EAST WEST AND SOUTH BUT FOUND ON EVERY SIDE THE COMPANY PREPARED UPON THEIR NETS AT LENGTH SHE FLEW RIGHT UP SOARING AT A MOST ASTONISHING RATE TOWARDS THE SUN
ITS APPEARANCE IN THIS STATE HAS BEEN SO FREQUENTLY NOTICED BY DIFFERENT TRAVELLERS THAT I WILL NOT TIRE YOU WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF OBJECTS YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH I WALKED ROUND THE EDGE OF THE CRATER WHICH APPEARED TO BE FIFTY TIMES AT LEAST AS CAPACIOUS AS THE DEVIL'S PUNCH BOWL NEAR
THE FOLLOWING SINGULAR ADVENTURES MAY NOT PROVE UNENTERTAINING AFTER WE HAD RESIDED AT CEYLON ABOUT A FORTNIGHT I ACCOMPANIED ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BROTHERS UPON A SHOOTING PARTY
THE ASTONISHING EFFECTS OF A STORM ARRIVES AT CEYLON COMBATS AND CONQUERS TWO EXTRAORDINARY OPPONENTS RETURNS TO HOLLAND SOME YEARS BEFORE MY BEARD ANNOUNCED APPROACHING MANHOOD OR IN OTHER WORDS WHEN I WAS NEITHER MAN NOR BOY
AT A LOSS WHERE TO STEER AT LENGTH THE STORM ABATED WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY A STEADY BRISK GALE THAT CARRIED US AT LEAST FORTY KNOTS AN HOUR FOR SIX MONTHS WE SHOULD SUPPOSE THE BARON HAS MADE A LITTLE MISTAKE AND SUBSTITUTED MONTHS FOR DAYS
FOR THIS PURPOSE THE WHOLE HOUSE ROSE UP TO CATCH HER
THAT SAGACIOUS ANIMAL SEEING THE DANGER OF HIS MASTER ENDEAVOURED TO PROTECT HIM BY FLOURISHING HIS PROBOSCIS ROUND THE HEAD OF THE SULTAN FEARLESS I ADVANCED AGAINST THE ELEPHANT DESIROUS TO TAKE ALIVE THE HAUGHTY TIPPOO SAHIB
AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
I VENTURED TO RAISE MY HEAD AND LOOK ROUND WHEN
WAUWAU DID NOT TOTALLY LOSE HER PRESENCE OF MIND BUT AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION MADE SEVERAL VIOLENT DARTS AGAINST THE VOLUME OF THE BALLOON SO FIERCE AS AT LENGTH TO TEAR OPEN A GREAT SPACE
IT WAS NOW EVIDENT THAT I HAD PASSED FROM MOUNT ETNA THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH TO THE SOUTH SEAS THIS GENTLEMEN WAS A MUCH SHORTER CUT THAN GOING ROUND THE WORLD AND WHICH NO MAN HAS ACCOMPLISHED OR EVER ATTEMPTED BUT MYSELF
HE CEASED AND DISMAL WAS THE TONE THAT SOFTLY BREATHED FROM ALL THE FROGS IN CHORUS WHO QUICK HAD PETRIFIED WITH FRIGHT UNLESS REDOUBTED GOG AND MAGOG BOTH WITH POLES
A COUSIN BY MY MOTHER'S SIDE TOOK A LIKING TO ME OFTEN SAID I WAS FINE FORWARD YOUTH AND WAS MUCH INCLINED TO GRATIFY MY CURIOSITY HIS ELOQUENCE HAD MORE EFFECT THAN MINE FOR MY FATHER CONSENTED TO MY ACCOMPANYING HIM IN A VOYAGE TO THE ISLAND OF CEYLON
AND FASTENED THEREIN WITH A KIND OF CEMENT OR PASTE
DEBATING UPON THE POLITICS AND LEARNING OF THEIR DAYS I GAVE THEM INEXPRESSIBLE DELIGHT IN TELLING THEM IN A FEW WORDS ALL THE DISCOVERIES OF NEWTON AND THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD SINCE THEIR TIME
CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT THE BARON SETS ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE EMPIRE TO WORK TO BUILD A BRIDGE FROM THEIR COUNTRY TO GREAT BRITAIN HIS CONTRIVANCE TO RENDER THE ARCH SECURE
WHILE SPHINX THOUGH GREAT GIGANTIC SEEMED INSTINCTIVE BASE AND COWARDLY AND AT THE SIGHT OF STORMING GINGERBREAD AND POWERS MAGOG AND GOG AND QUIXOTE ALL AGAINST HER
AND CHALLENGES TIPPOO SAHIB TO SINGLE COMBAT THEY FIGHT THE BARON RECEIVES SOME WOUNDS TO HIS FACE BUT AT LAST VANQUISHES THE TYRANT THE BARON RETURNS TO EUROPE AND RAISES THE HULL OF THE ROYAL GEORGE
QUITE RIPE AND READY TO DROP OFF THE STALK FOR WANT OF BEING PULLED HEIGH HO BUT PRAY MY LADY SAID I HOW DO YOU LIKE THE CONCERT ALAS SAID SHE LANGUISHINGLY WHILE SHE LAID HER HAND UPON MY SHOULDER
THE BARON SLIPS THROUGH THE WORLD AFTER PAYING A VISIT TO MOUNT ETNA HE FINDS HIMSELF IN THE SOUTH SEA VISITS VULCAN IN HIS PASSAGE GETS ON BOARD A DUTCHMAN
ASTONISHED THUNDERSTRUCK FORGOT THEIR NOTES AND MUSIC THAT BEFORE HAD SEEMED SO TERRIBLE AND DROWNED THE CRIES OF KNIGHT RENOWN AND MUTE IN WONDER HEARD THE WORDS OF WHITTINGTON PRONOUNCING SOLEMN
I THOUGHT I HEARD A RUSTLING NOISE BEHIND ON TURNING ABOUT I WAS ALMOST PETRIFIED AS WHO WOULD NOT BE AT THE SIGHT OF A LION WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY APPROACHING WITH THE INTENTION OF SATISFYING HIS APPETITE WITH MY POOR CARCASE
I THEN WENT TO THE POOR KING AND MAKING MY OBEISANCE TO HIM SIRE SAID I YOUR ENEMIES HAVE ALL FLED I ALONE AM THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AT PRESENT
WE LET OUT A YOUNG ONE UNFEATHERED CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN TWENTY FULL GROWN VULTURES JUST AS WE HAD GIVEN THIS YOUNGSTER HIS LIBERTY THE OLD KINGFISHER LIGHTED AND SEIZING OUR CAPTAIN WHO HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN BREAKING THE EGG IN ONE OF HER CLAWS
IF ONCE I GOT CONFUSED AS TO THE DIRECTION AND THEN PAUSED TO THINK WHAT WAS I TO DO I HAD NO MATCH IT SEEMED AWFUL TO ATTEMPT THAT LONG JOURNEY BACK THROUGH THE UTTER GLOOM AND YET I COULD NOT STAND THERE ALL NIGHT AND IF I DID
IN ADDITION HIS FACE WAS ALMOST WITHOUT FLAW A GOOD FACE AS WELL AS A BEAUTIFUL ONE AND WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HAT WHICH HE DID JUST THEN TO A PASSING LADY I SAW THAT HIS HEAD WAS COVERED WITH LITTLE GOLDEN CURLS GROWING CLOSE TO THE SCALP
PARTLY TO SEE WHERE IT WENT TO AND PARTLY FROM A RESTLESS DESIRE TO BE DOING SOMETHING I FOLLOWED THE PASSAGE IT LED TO A STONE STAIR WHICH I DESCENDED THE STAIR ENDED IN ANOTHER PASSAGE OR RATHER TUNNEL ALSO HEWN OUT OF THE BED ROCK
AND BEGGED HER TO SPARE THEM OR AT LEAST TO METE OUT THEIR FATE IN SOME LESS AWFUL WAY BUT SHE WAS HARD AS ADAMANT ABOUT IT MY HOLLY SHE SAID AGAIN SPEAKING IN GREEK WHICH TO TELL THE TRUTH ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED A BETTER SCHOLAR OF THE LANGUAGE THAN MOST MEN
OH WHY COULD I NOT DIE WITH THEE I WHO SLEW THEE ALAS THAT I CANNOT DIE ALAS ALAS AND SHE FLUNG HERSELF PRONE UPON THE GROUND AND SOBBED AND WEPT TILL I THOUGHT HER HEART MUST BURST
YOUNG WOMAN YOUR POSITION IS ONE THAT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND AND CAN'T RECOGNISE LET ME TELL YOU THAT I HAS A DUTY TO PERFORM TO MY MASTER AS IS INCAPACITATED BY ILLNESS
A FINE BROAD CHESTED FELLOW WELL ON IN MIDDLE LIFE WITH DEEP GRAVEN FEATURES AND AN EYE LIKE A HAWK'S SPOKE AND SAID THAT THE ORDERS THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED WERE NOT TO HARM THE WHITE MEN NOTHING WAS SAID OF THEIR BLACK SERVANT
HOW IS MISTER LEO JOB MUCH THE SAME SIR IF HE DON'T SOON MEND HE'LL END SIR AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT IT THOUGH I MUST SAY THAT THAT THERE SAVAGE USTANE DO DO HER BEST FOR HIM ALMOST LIKE A BAPTISED CHRISTIAN
A STOUTISH LADY WHOSE NAME I DO NOT REMEMBER CAME ALONG THE PAVEMENT ACCOMPANIED BY A PRETTY FAIR HAIRED GIRL AND THESE TWO MISTER VINCEY WHO CLEARLY KNEW THEM WELL AT ONCE JOINED WALKING OFF IN THEIR COMPANY
YE HAVE HEARD SAID SHE AT LENGTH IN A COLD CLEAR VOICE VERY DIFFERENT FROM HER USUAL TONES INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT THIS EXTRAORDINARY CREATURE
YOUR LIVES WOULD NOT BE SAFE AMONG THIS PEOPLE FOR A DAY THOU KNOWEST THEM NOT THEY ARE TIGERS TO LAP BLOOD AND EVEN NOW THEY HUNGER FOR YOUR LIVES HOW THINKEST THOU THAT I RULE THIS PEOPLE I HAVE BUT A REGIMENT OF GUARDS TO DO MY BIDDING
AND I TREMBLED AT THE NAME I MUST LOOK UPON THY FACE AGAIN THOUGH IT BE AGONY IT IS A GENERATION SINCE I LOOKED UPON THEE WHOM I SLEW SLEW WITH MINE OWN HAND
MY LOVE WHY DID THAT STRANGER BRING THEE BACK TO ME AFTER THIS SORT FOR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS I HAVE NOT SUFFERED THUS OH IF I SINNED AGAINST THEE HAVE I NOT WIPED AWAY THE SIN WHEN WILT THOU COME BACK TO ME WHO HAVE ALL
BUT OH MY DEAR SON BE MORE CAREFUL YESTERDAY I MADE SURE IN MY HEART THAT SHE WOULD BLAST THEE WHEN THOU DIDST NOT CRAWL UPON THY STOMACH BEFORE HER
WE NEVER ASCERTAINED AND NOW ALAS WE NEVER SHALL AT LEAST NOT YET THESE AND MANY OTHER QUESTIONS ARISE IN MY MIND BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD OF ASKING THEM NOW WILL YOU UNDERTAKE THE TASK
WHOSE NAME I DISCOVERED WAS HOLLY WHEN HE SAW THE LADIES ADVANCING HE SUDDENLY STOPPED SHORT IN HIS TALK CAST A REPROACHFUL LOOK AT HIS COMPANION AND WITH AN ABRUPT NOD TO MYSELF TURNED AND MARCHED OFF ALONE ACROSS THE STREET
AND THE FIERCE LIGHT AND DEEP GLOOM
BUT A MONTH AGO I RECEIVED A LETTER AND TWO PACKETS ONE OF MANUSCRIPT
WAS I MAD OR DRUNK OR DREAMING OR WAS I MERELY THE VICTIM OF A GIGANTIC AND MOST ELABORATE HOAX HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT I A RATIONAL MAN NOT UNACQUAINTED WITH THE LEADING SCIENTIFIC FACTS OF OUR HISTORY
WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE NECESSARY I INTRODUCE THE WORLD TO AYESHA AND THE CAVES OF KOR THE EDITOR P S THERE IS ON CONSIDERATION
BUT AS I WENT ON I ABANDONED THAT IDEA ALSO TO ME THE STORY SEEMS TO BEAR THE STAMP OF TRUTH UPON ITS FACE ITS EXPLANATION I MUST LEAVE TO OTHERS AND WITH THIS SLIGHT PREFACE
AS I WAS FORCED TO OWN TO MYSELF EVEN NOW IN THE SOBER LIGHT OF DAY SHE HERSELF HAD ATTRACTIONS THAT I COULD NOT FORGET NOT EVEN THE DREADFUL SIGHT WHICH I HAD WITNESSED DURING THE NIGHT COULD DRIVE THAT FOLLY FROM MY MIND AND ALAS THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO ADMIT IT
AND WELL KNEW THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER GIFT OF LIFE WATERED BY HER WISDOM AND SHONE UPON WITH THE SUNSHINE OF HER PRESENCE IT WOULD BLOOM LIKE A FLOWER AND FLASH OUT LIKE A STAR
NO MERELY MORTAL WOMAN COULD SHINE WITH SUCH A SUPERNATURAL RADIANCE ABOUT THAT SHE HAD AT ANY RATE BEEN IN THE RIGHT IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR ANY MAN TO LOOK UPON SUCH BEAUTY I WAS A HARDENED VESSEL IN SUCH MATTERS
TO BE BRIEF AND COME TO MY BUSINESS I HAVE RECENTLY READ WITH MUCH INTEREST A BOOK OF YOURS DESCRIBING A CENTRAL AFRICAN ADVENTURE
AND ALSO BY SHE HERSELF WHEN I HAD DONE AYESHA CALLED UPON BILLALI BY NAME AND LIFTING HIS HEAD FROM THE GROUND BUT WITHOUT RISING THE OLD MAN CONFIRMED MY STORY NO FURTHER EVIDENCE WAS TAKEN
AND RUNNING SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE EXACTLY BENEATH THE GALLERY THAT LED TO THE ENTRANCE OF OUR ROOMS AND ACROSS THE GREAT CENTRAL CAVE I WENT ON DOWN IT IT WAS AS SILENT AS THE GRAVE BUT STILL
A FACT THAT PROVED TO ME THAT THESE DAIS MUST HAVE BEEN USED AS ALTARS PROBABLY FOR THE CELEBRATION OF RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES AND MORE ESPECIALLY OF RITES CONNECTED WITH THE INTERMENT OF THE DEAD ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS DAIS WERE PASSAGES LEADING BILLALI INFORMED ME TO OTHER CAVES FULL OF DEAD BODIES
OF ONE I HATE AND ONE I LOVE AND THEN AS THOUGH TO TURN THE CONVERSATION SHE ADDRESSED THE CAPTAIN OF HER GUARD IN ARABIC LET THE MEN BE BROUGHT BEFORE ME THE CAPTAIN BOWED LOW FOR THE GUARD AND HER ATTENDANTS DID NOT PROSTRATE THEMSELVES
SO MUCH MORE HORRIBLE EVEN THAN ANYTHING THAT HAD GONE BEFORE THAT I COULD NO LONGER BEAR TO LOOK AT IT AND TURNING BEGAN TO CREEP SHAKING AS I WAS IN EVERY LIMB SLOWLY ALONG THE PITCH DARK PASSAGE
BUT SHE STOPPED THEM NAY SHE SAID IN HER SOFTEST VOICE STAND I PRAY YOU STAND PERCHANCE THE TIME WILL SOON BE WHEN YE SHALL GROW WEARY OF BEING STRETCHED OUT AND SHE LAUGHED MELODIOUSLY
FILLING THE WORLD WITH LIGHT AND FRAGRANCE HERE ALSO I AM NOT ABLE TO ANSWER BUT MUST LEAVE THE READER TO FORM HIS OWN JUDGMENT ON THE FACTS BEFORE HIM
GOOD GRACIOUS I SAID TO MY FRIEND WITH WHOM I WAS WALKING
SUDDENLY SHE CEASED RAISED HERSELF TO HER FEET REARRANGED HER ROBE AND TOSSING BACK HER LONG LOCKS IMPATIENTLY SWEPT ACROSS TO WHERE THE FIGURE LAY UPON THE STONE
I FEEL IT INCUMBENT ON ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT MY EXACT CONNECTION WITH IT IS AND SO I MAY AS WELL SAY AT ONCE THAT I AM NOT THE NARRATOR BUT ONLY THE EDITOR OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY HISTORY AND THEN GO ON TO TELL HOW IT FOUND ITS WAY INTO MY HANDS
YOU WILL SEE IT STATED IN THIS MANUSCRIPT THAT I OR RATHER WE HAD MADE UP OUR MINDS NOT TO MAKE THIS HISTORY PUBLIC DURING OUR JOINT LIVES NOR SHOULD WE ALTER OUR DETERMINATION WERE IT NOT FOR A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAS RECENTLY ARISEN
THIS WAS THE LAST I SAW OR HEARD OF CHARON AND THE GREEK GOD FOR MANY A LONG DAY
AY AND MORE THAN HALF OF OUR MISFORTUNES WHY CANNOT MAN BE CONTENT TO LIVE ALONE AND BE HAPPY AND LET THE WOMEN LIVE ALONE AND BE HAPPY TOO BUT PERHAPS THEY WOULD NOT BE HAPPY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT WE SHOULD EITHER HERE IS A NICE STATE OF AFFAIRS
OR IS THE TRUE EXPLANATION WHAT I BELIEVE IT TO BE NAMELY THAT AYESHA SEEING FURTHER THAN WE CAN SEE PERCEIVED THE GERM AND SMOULDERING SPARK OF GREATNESS WHICH LAY HID WITHIN HER LOVER'S SOUL
MY WEARIED BODY AND OVERSTRAINED MIND AWAKENED ALL MY IMAGINATION INTO PRETERNATURAL ACTIVITY IDEAS VISIONS ALMOST INSPIRATIONS FLOATED BEFORE IT WITH STARTLING VIVIDNESS MOST OF THEM WERE GROTESQUE ENOUGH
ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN WAS I THINK WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE HANDSOMEST YOUNG FELLOW I HAVE EVER SEEN HE WAS VERY TALL VERY BROAD AND HAD A LOOK OF POWER AND A GRACE OF BEARING THAT SEEMED AS NATIVE TO HIM AS IT IS TO A WILD STAG
AND THEREUPON THE ENTIRE CROWD OF SPECTATORS INSTANTLY PRECIPITATED ITSELF UPON THE GROUND AND LAY STILL AS THOUGH IT WERE INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY STRICKEN DEAD LEAVING ME STANDING THERE LIKE SOME SOLITARY SURVIVOR OF A MASSACRE
PERHAPS IT WAS A CAVE WHERE I COULD GET A LIGHT AT ANY RATE IT WAS WORTH INVESTIGATING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY I CREPT ALONG THE TUNNEL KEEPING MY HAND AGAINST ITS WALL AND FEELING AT EVERY STEP WITH MY FOOT BEFORE I PUT IT DOWN
HE COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE PAPERS THEMSELVES TO CRAWL ALONG DOWN TO WASHINGTON BY A MAIL TRAIN WHICH HAS NEVER RUN OVER A COW SINCE THE ROAD WAS BUILT FOR THE REASON THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO OVERTAKE ONE
HE WALKED THE FLOOR FEVERISHLY HIS MIND TORTURED BY INDECISION PRESENTLY HE STOPPED TOOK OUT HIS POCKET BOOK AND COUNTED HIS MONEY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS IT WAS ALL HE HAD IN THE WORLD
WHY DID THEY STICK TO THAT POOR THIN STORY ABOUT PICKING HER UP OUT OF A STEAMBOAT EXPLOSION UNDER THIS CEASELESS PERSECUTION LAURA'S MORBID SELF COMMUNING WAS RENEWED
WHOSE LAND HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM BY THE WHITE MAN IN THE INTERESTS OF CIVILIZATION BUT BALLOON KNEW THEIR NEEDS BETTER HE BUILT A GOVERNMENT SAW MILL ON THE RESERVATION WITH THE MONEY AND THE LUMBER SOLD FOR ENORMOUS PRICES A RELATIVE OF HIS DID ALL THE WORK FREE OF CHARGE
THE RECENT WEARING DAYS AND NIGHTS OF WATCHING AND THE WASTING GRIEF THAT HAD POSSESSED HER COMBINED WITH THE PROFOUND DEPRESSION THAT NATURALLY CAME WITH THE REACTION OF IDLENESS MADE LAURA PECULIARLY SUSCEPTIBLE AT THIS TIME
IN THE FULLNESS OF RIPE WOMANHOOD A SUPERB CREATURE WITH ALL THE FASCINATION THAT A WOMAN OF THE WORLD HAS FOR SUCH A MAN AS COLONEL SELBY NOTHING OF THIS WAS LOST ON HIM HE STEPPED QUICKLY TO HER
I SHALL NOT GET OFF I HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT HERE AS YOU WE'LL SEE SAID THE CONDUCTOR ADVANCING WITH THE BRAKEMEN THE PASSENGERS PROTESTED AND SOME OF THEM SAID TO EACH OTHER THAT'S TOO BAD AS THEY ALWAYS DO IN SUCH CASES
WHAT HE'S BOUT NO SAH DAT MAN DO NO WHAT HE'S BOUT
ENOUGH FOR HIM WAS THE PRESENT ALSO HAD THERE NOT ALWAYS BEEN SOME WAY OUT OF SUCH SCRAPES AND YET LAURA COULD NOT BE QUITE CONTENT WITHOUT PRYING INTO TOMORROW
SONS IN LAW NOTHING LIKE A SON IN LAW HERE IN WASHINGTON OR A BROTHER IN LAW AND EVERYBODY HAS EM LET'S SEE SIXTY ONE WITH PLACES TWENTY FIVE PERSUADED IT IS GETTING ON WE'LL HAVE TWO THIRDS OF CONGRESS IN TIME DILWORTHY MUST SURELY KNOW I UNDERSTAND HIM
AND THE BLACK PAST AND THE TROUBLED PRESENT AND THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE COULD NOT SNATCH THAT FROM HER WHAT DID THEY SAY AS THEY SAT THERE WHAT NOTHINGS DO PEOPLE USUALLY SAY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN IT WAS A HARD BLOW TO POOR SELLERS TO SEE THE WORK ON HIS DARLING ENTERPRISE STOP AND THE NOISE AND BUSTLE AND CONFUSION THAT HAD BEEN SUCH REFRESHMENT TO HIS SOUL SICKEN AND DIE OUT
THE PILES OF YELLOW BISCUITS THE DISCOURAGED LOOKING PLATES OF BUTTER THE LANDLORD WAITED AND PHILIP WAS PLEASED TO OBSERVE THE CHANGE IN HIS MANNER IN THE BARROOM HE WAS THE CONCILIATORY LANDLORD STANDING BEHIND HIS GUESTS AT TABLE
WHY THE ASIATIC PLAGUE THAT NEARLY DEPOPULATED LONDON A COUPLE OF CENTURIES AGO BUT HOW DOES THAT CONCERN US THERE IS NO PLAGUE HERE I RECKON SH I'VE LET IT OUT
THEY WOULD NEVER END HER DAUGHTER'S LOVE WOULD WEAN ITSELF AWAY FROM HER AND HER HEART WOULD BREAK HER GRIEF SO WROUGHT UPON LAURA THAT THE GIRL ALMOST FORGOT HER OWN TROUBLES FOR THE MOMENT IN HER COMPASSION FOR HER MOTHER'S DISTRESS
BY THE PLEASURABLE EXCITEMENT ALMOST AS EFFECTUALLY AS PRECEDING WEEKS OF ANXIETY HAD DONE IT HE SHAPED HIS COURSE STRAIGHT FOR HAWKEYE NOW AND HIS MEETING WITH HIS MOTHER AND THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD WAS JOYFUL ALBEIT HE HAD BEEN AWAY SO LONG
DOUT SOMEBODY AST HIM TO DO IT NO INDEEDY
HE WAS CLINGING TO THE STARBOARD WHEEL OF THE BURNING WRECK AT THE TIME A FALLING TIMBER STRUCK HIM ON THE HEAD BUT I WILL WRITE OUT HIS WONDERFUL ESCAPE IN FULL TO MORROW OR NEXT DAY OF COURSE
THE LITTLE COMPANY ASSEMBLED ON THE LOG WERE ALL CHILDREN AT LEAST IN SIMPLICITY AND BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE IGNORANCE AND THE REMARKS THEY MADE ABOUT THE RIVER WERE IN KEEPING WITH THE CHARACTER
THE DARKENED ROOM THE LABORED BREATHING AND OCCASIONAL MOANINGS OF THE PATIENT THE TIP TOEING OF THE ATTENDANTS AND THEIR WHISPERED CONSULTATIONS WERE FULL OF SAD MEANING FOR THREE OR FOUR NIGHTS MISSUS HAWKINS AND LAURA HAD BEEN WATCHING BY THE BEDSIDE
BUT STILL I WOULD NOT TURN MY BACK ON A HOMELESS ORPHAN IF HE WILL GO WITH ME I WILL GIVE HIM A HOME AND LOVING REGARD I WILL DO FOR HIM AS I WOULD HAVE ANOTHER DO FOR A CHILD OF MY OWN IN MISFORTUNE
AND ADDED THAT THE MONEY MUST BE PAID WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OR THE LAND WOULD BE SOLD AT PUBLIC AUCTION FOR THE TAXES AS PROVIDED BY LAW
THAT HE ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTIONS OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO HER THE NEXT DAY AN INTENTION WHICH HARRY RECEIVED GLUMLY AND WHEN THE SENATOR WAS OUT OF HEARING HE CALLED HIM AN OLD FOOL FIE SAID LAURA I DO BELIEVE YOU ARE JEALOUS HARRY
OF ALL THE AGES THERE WAS SOMETHING THRILLING ABOUT IT TO A STRANGER NOT TO SAY AWE INSPIRING STAND OFF THE CAT'S TAIL CHILD CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING COME COME COME
I HAVE A MUCH GREATER ADMIRATION FOR SENATOR BALLOON YES BALLOON IS A MAN OF PARTS THERE IS NO DENYING IT I THINK SO HE IS SPOKEN OF FOR THE POST OF MINISTER TO CHINA OR AUSTRIA AND I HOPE WILL BE APPOINTED
THERE'S WORLDS OF MONEY IN IT WHOLE WORLDS OF MONEY PRACTICE FIRST IN HAWKEYE THEN IN JEFFERSON THEN IN SAINT LOUIS THEN IN NEW YORK IN THE METROPOLIS OF THE WESTERN WORLD CLIMB AND CLIMB AND CLIMB AND WIND UP ON THE SUPREME BENCH
WHY BLESS YOU LET THE APPROPRIATION LAG IF IT WANTS TO THAT'S NO GREAT MATTER THERE'S A BIGGER THING THAN THAT
I DON'T KNOW ANY MAN IN CONGRESS I'D SOONER GO TO FOR HELP IN ANY CHRISTIAN WORK WHAT DID HE SAY OH HE BEAT AROUND A LITTLE HE SAID HE SHOULD LIKE TO HELP THE NEGRO HIS HEART WENT OUT TO THE NEGRO AND ALL THAT PLENTY OF THEM SAY THAT BUT HE WAS A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE TENNESSEE LAND BILL
IT WAS HARD TO COME DOWN TO HUMDRUM ORDINARY LIFE AGAIN AFTER BEING A GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT AND THE MOST CONSPICUOUS MAN IN THE COMMUNITY IT WAS SAD TO SEE HIS NAME DISAPPEAR FROM THE NEWSPAPERS
IS IT IN GOOD REPAIR PERFECT HAIR RUBBED OFF A LITTLE BUT THE MAIN STRUCTURE IS PERFECTLY SOUND DOES IT LEAK ANYWHERE
BUT HE IS RIGHT AT HEART HIS TERM EXPIRES NEXT YEAR AND I FEAR WE SHALL LOSE HIM HE SEEMED TO BE PACKING THE DAY I WAS THERE HIS ROOMS WERE FULL OF DRY GOODS BOXES INTO WHICH HIS SERVANT WAS CROWDING ALL MANNER OF OLD CLOTHES AND STUFF
I'M GOING TO BEGIN AGAIN TOO INDEED YES SIR I'VE SEEN ENOUGH TO SHOW ME WHERE MY MISTAKE WAS THE LAW IS WHAT I WAS BORN FOR I SHALL BEGIN THE STUDY OF THE LAW HEAVENS AND EARTH BUT THAT BRAHAM'S A WONDERFUL MAN A WONDERFUL MAN SIR
I AM LEAVING YOU IN CRUEL POVERTY I HAVE BEEN SO FOOLISH SO SHORT SIGHTED BUT COURAGE A BETTER DAY IS
THAT FIGURED IN THE TALES THE NEGRO SLAVES WERE IN THE HABIT OF TELLING THEM NIGHTLY BY THE SHUDDERING LIGHT OF THE KITCHEN FIRE AT THE END OF NEARLY A WEEK OF TRAVEL THE PARTY WENT INTO CAMP NEAR A SHABBY VILLAGE WHICH WAS CAVING HOUSE BY HOUSE INTO THE HUNGRY MISSISSIPPI
HE HOPED HE HAD LEFT A MARK ON HIM BUT AFTER ALL WAS THAT THE BEST WAY HERE WAS HE PHILIP STERLING CALLING HIMSELF A GENTLEMAN IN A BRAWL WITH A VULGAR CONDUCTOR ABOUT A WOMAN HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS SO ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE NEW YORK PAPERS WOULD SAY ABOUT THE BILL THAT HE HAD ARRANGED TO HAVE SYNOPSES OF THEIR EDITORIALS
AT FIRST PHILIP WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE THE RESULT OF EVERY BLAST AND WAS ALWAYS BACK AND PEERING AMONG THE SMOKE THE MOMENT AFTER THE EXPLOSION BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANY ENCOURAGING RESULT AND THEREFORE HE FINALLY LOST ALMOST ALL INTEREST
BUT WE HAVE A RESPECT FOR A MAN THAT'S GOT THE PLUCK THAT YOU'VE SHOWED YOU'VE FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT WITH EVERYBODY AGIN YOU
OTHER AFTERNOONS LIKE IT FOLLOWED WASHINGTON PLUNGED INTO THIS LOVE AFFAIR AS HE PLUNGED INTO EVERYTHING ELSE UPON IMPULSE AND WITHOUT REFLECTION AS THE DAYS WENT BY
HE MARSHALLED THE PROCESSION OF MASONS OF ODD FELLOWS AND OF FIREMEN THE GOOD TEMPLARS THE SONS OF TEMPERANCE THE CADETS OF TEMPERANCE THE DAUGHTERS OF REBECCA THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN AND CITIZENS GENERALLY WHICH FOLLOWED THE SENATOR TO THE COURT HOUSE
I SEE NODDED THE SENATOR BUT YOU'D BETTER BEGIN BY ASKING ONLY FOR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE USUAL WAY YOU CAN BEGIN TO SELL TOWN LOTS ON THAT APPROPRIATION YOU KNOW
THE NEARER IT GROWS TO THE TIME WHEN IT WILL START SAME AS EVERY DAY YOU LIVE BRINGS YOU NEARER TO NEARER THE GRAVE WELL NO NOT THAT EXACTLY BUT YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS
THE MOUNTAIN BEFORE HIM MIGHT BE EIGHT HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND WAS ONLY A PORTION OF A LONG UNBROKEN RANGE SAVAGELY WOODED WHICH FOLLOWED THE STREAM BEHIND THE HOTEL AND ACROSS THE BRAWLING BROOK
AFTER TRYING THAT GREEN HUED COMPOUND CALLED COFFEE AND MADE HIS BREAKFAST OUT OF THAT AND SOME HARD CRACKERS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN IMPORTED INTO ILIUM BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IRON HORSE
BUT WHEN THEY THREW THE TWO BEARS TRIUMPHANTLY ON THE FLOOR OF THE HUT THEIR FATHER HARDLY LOOKED AT THEM AND ONLY SAID
AN HOUR OR TWO PASSED AND EVERYONE WAS WAITING AND WATCHING WHEN AT LAST THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS WAS HEARD AND A GRAND PROCESSION WAS SEEN MARCHING UP THE STREET A CHAIR COVERED WITH VELVET HAD BEEN MADE READY FOR THE KING AND HE TOOK HIS SEAT UPON IT AND LOOKING ROUND UPON THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY HE SAID
BUT WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE POOR LITTLE HOUSE WHICH WAS TO BE HER HOME THEIR HEARTS GREW LIGHT AGAIN
THEY SAW AT LAST THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO CARRY TO THE KING THE SAD TIDINGS OF HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE AND WHAT GREAT WEEPING AND LAMENTATION THERE WAS IN THE PALACE WHEN THE DREADFUL NEWS WAS TOLD
BY THAT TIME THE FEAST WILL BE READY HELGA HAD SO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT THAT THE RIDE HOME APPEARED VERY SHORT HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE DELIGHTED TO SEE HER AS THEY DID NOT FEEL SURE THAT SO UGLY AND CROSS LOOKING A MAN AS HABOGI
AND THEN THE THONG OF HIS SNOW SHOES BROKE AND HE HAD TO STOP AND MEND IT SO THAT THE BEAR AND THE DOG GOT SO FAR AHEAD THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE BARKING WHEN THE STRAP WAS FIRM AGAIN
IN A SMALL HUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST LIVED A MAN HIS WIFE THREE SONS AND A DAUGHTER FOR SOME REASON ALL THE ANIMALS SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY
SUDDENLY ABOUT MIDNIGHT THE FOX GAVE A LOW WHINE AND DREW NEARER TO HIS BEDFELLOW COUSIN HE WHISPERED VERY LOW THERE IS SOMEONE COMING WHO WILL TAKE THE KNAPSACK AWAY FROM ME LOOK OVER THERE
AND SOON THE MILK WAS FLOWING THROUGH THE HUT DOWNHILL TOWARDS THEIR PARENTS IN THE FIELDS BELOW THE MAN SAW A WHITE STREAM A LONG WAY OFF AND GUESSED WHAT HAD HAPPENED WIFE WIFE HE CALLED LOUDLY TO THE WOMAN
THE GOLDEN HEN WAS GIVEN TO HIM AT ONCE AND MORE THAN THAT THE SISTER OF THE SUN TOLD HIM THAT IN A LITTLE TIME WHEN HE WAS A FEW YEARS OLDER SHE WOULD HERSELF PAY A VISIT TO HIS HOME AND BECOME HIS WIFE
BUT IT IS NOT EVERYBODY WHO HAS A WIFE AS CLEVER AS MINE MEANWHILE THE OTHER WIFE WAS NOT IDLE AS SOON AS HER HUSBAND ENTERED SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH SUCH A LOOK OF TERROR THAT THE POOR MAN WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED
THE WITCH WAS ENCHANTED AT THIS SIGHT AND EAGERLY HELPED HER BROTHER TO SET DOWN AND OPEN THE CHEST WHICH WAS FULL OF THE GHASTLY FOOD SHE HAD BEEN LONGING FOR THE HORRID PAIR SET TO AND GREEDILY DEVOURED IT ALL
AS HE CROSSED THE MOSSY LAWN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER BUT ALAS SHE WAS NO LONGER THERE HE SEARCHED EVERY THICKET AND PATH HE LOOKED BEHIND EVERY TREE AND GAZED INTO EVERY POND
BEGAN TO BARK LOUDLY AND THE BEAR RUSHED OUT OF THE THICKET AND SET OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MOUNTAIN WITHOUT THINKING THAT THEY HAD NOTHING TO DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH SHOULD THE BEAR TURN AND ATTACK THEM THE BOYS GAVE CHASE
HE PASSED THROUGH THE GARDENS WHICH FOR HIM HAD LOST THEIR CHARM AND THE SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS'S FOOTPRINTS ON THE GOLDEN SAND OF THE PATHWAY RENEWED HIS GRIEF ALL WAS LONELY EMPTY SORROWFUL
AND IF YOU SHOULD GET TIRED ON THE ROAD JUST TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND RUSTLE THE PAPER SO THE YOUNG MAN PUT THE LETTER IN HIS POCKET AND WALKED ALL DAY OVER THE HILLS TILL HE REACHED A LITTLE TURF HUT EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER TWO
THIS TIME THE PRINCESS SENT FOR THE MERCHANT AND QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THE GIVER NOW THE MERCHANT WAS USUALLY A MOST HONEST MAN BUT HE DID NOT QUITE LIKE TO DESCRIBE WALI DAD IN HIS TRUE LIGHT AS AN OLD MAN WHOSE INCOME WAS FIVE HALFPENCE A DAY
AND THE YOUNG MAN DID WHAT HE WAS TOLD AND LEFT THE FOREST LOOKING EXACTLY AS IT HAD DONE BEFORE NOW SURELY THOUGHT THE PRINCESS THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY NEED TO PUT OFF THE WEDDING AND SHE GAVE ORDERS THAT ALL SHOULD BE READY FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY
AND HIS WIFE GAVE ORDERS TO THE GRAVEDIGGER ABOUT HIS GRAVE THAT EVENING THE COFFIN WAS SENT HOME AND IN THE MORNING AT NINE O'CLOCK THE WOMAN PUT HIM ON A LONG FLANNEL GARMENT AND CALLED TO THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN
I SHALL THANK YOU HEARTILY THE MERCHANT FELT HANDSOMELY REPAID FOR HIS TROUBLE AND WONDERED GREATLY HOW THE MATTER WOULD TURN OUT
AND YOU CAN SPEEDILY CALL UP AGAIN EVERY FORM YOU WISH TO SEE THE GREAT GREEN PATCH IN THE GARDEN WILL PROVE YOU WITH A MORE LIVELY COMPANY SO SAYING THE GNOME TOOK HIMSELF OFF
WHICH CERTAINLY DID LOOK VERY INVITING AND THEY ALL WENT GAILY TO THIS NEW AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS WAS READY FIRST BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE SLIPPED OVER THE RIM OF THE POOL WHEN DOWN DOWN DOWN SHE SANK
THERE WERE OTHER YOUNG MEN TOO WHO BORE DIFFERENT NAMES THOUGH NOT ONE OF THEM WAS CALLED HABOGI AND THESE THOUGHT THAT THEY MIGHT PERHAPS GAIN THE HEART OF THE YOUNGEST BUT
THE WOLVERINE'S COAT SO NEATLY THAT THOUGH IT WAS TORN INTO TINY SHREDS THE WOLVERINE HIMSELF WAS QUITE UNHARMED THAT
AND EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS AND OTHER JEWELS THE PRINCE HAD HARDLY LEFT HER BEFORE THE WITCH RESUMED HER PROPER SHAPE AND TORE ABOUT THE ROOM RAGING AND STORMING AND FLINGING THE BEAUTIFUL SILK ON THE FLOOR
AND IN THE GARDEN WERE TWO TALL PLANTS WITH TWO BRILLIANT SHIELDS ON THE TOP YEARS PASSED AWAY AND THE BABIES WERE ALMOST MEN THEY WERE TIRED OF LIVING QUIETLY AT HOME BEING MISTAKEN FOR EACH OTHER BY EVERYBODY THEY SAW
THE MOUNTAIN WILL OPEN TO LET YOU IN AND THE HUNTERS WILL FOLLOW YOU THEN I SHALL HAVE THEM IN MY POWER AND BE ABLE TO REVENGE MYSELF THE SERVANT BOWED LOW
AND ALL FOUR TRAVELLED NIGHT AND DAY TILL THEY REACHED THE CASTLE OF THE SISTER OF THE SUN WHAT JOY AND FEASTING THERE WAS THROUGHOUT THE PALACE AT THE SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THEY HAD MOURNED AS DEAD AND THEY COULD NOT MAKE ENOUGH OF THE BOY WHO HAD GONE THROUGH SUCH DANGERS IN ORDER TO RESCUE HER
HE DID BUT WAS ASHAMED TO SAY SO AND ONLY ANSWERED WELL I AM SURE IT MUST BE BEAUTIFUL SINCE YOU SAY SO AND I SHALL BE SMARTER THAN ANYONE IN THE WHOLE VILLAGE WHAT A SPLENDID COAT THEY WILL EXCLAIM WHEN THEY SEE ME
WHILE THE HEN WRIGGLED HERSELF FREE AS BEFORE WHEN HE HAD GAZED HIS FILL HE WENT OUT INTO THE COURTYARD AND PICKED UP HIS HEN WHO WAS SEEKING FOR CORN AS HE DREW NEAR THE GATE HE PAUSED WHY DID I NOT GIVE HER A KISS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
AND AT LENGTH BEGAN TO CRY
TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS UNDERGROUND KINGDOM
THE SONS WERE RATHER DISAPPOINTED AT HEARING THIS AND THOUGH THERE WAS PLENTY OF MEAT TO LAST FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY STARTED OFF EARLY IN THE MORNING DOWN THE SAME TRAIL THAT THEY HAD FOLLOWED BEFORE
WHEN SHE HEARD THIS FOR SHE WAS VERY TIRED AND FOUND THE TWO SKINS FASTENED ROUND HER ALMOST TOO HEAVY TO CARRY SO IN SPITE OF HER DREAD OF THE OGRE SHE SLEPT TILL DAWN WHEN HER FATHER WOKE HER
HOW DELIGHTED THE WITCH WAS WHEN SHE FOUND THE CLOTHES ALL FINISHED THE NEXT TIME PRINCE RING CAME TO SEE HER SHE GAVE THEM TO HIM AND HE PAID HER MANY COMPLIMENTS ON HER SKILFUL WORK
THE SACRED MILK OF KOUMONGOE FAR WAY IN A VERY HOT COUNTRY THERE ONCE LIVED A MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAD TWO CHILDREN A SON NAMED KOANE AND A DAUGHTER
WHILST SHE WALKED ON INTO THE FOREST TILL SHE REACHED THE TWO OAK TREES HERE SHE RESUMED HER OWN GIGANTIC SHAPE TORE UP THE TREES BY THEIR ROOTS
AND I CERTAINLY SHA'N'T MOVE NOW TILL I AM FORCED TO I WILL CALL MY BROTHERS ANSWERED THE WOLVERINE
AND NIGHTINGALES SANG IN EVERY BUSH AS THE GNOME AND THE PRINCESS WANDERED IN THE LEAFY ALLEYS SOMETIMES GAZING AT THE MOON SOMETIMES PAUSING TO GATHER THE RAREST FLOWERS FOR HER ADORNMENT
OR WOULD SOME FIERY SPARK DART FROM THE HEART OF THE MIRROR AND STRIKE HIM DEAD NEITHER OF THESE THINGS OCCURRED BUT INSTEAD THE DRAGON STOPPED SHORT WITH SURPRISE AND RAGE WHEN HE SAW A MONSTER BEFORE HIM AS BIG AND STRONG AS HIMSELF
AND DANCES AND AMUSEMENTS OF ALL SORTS ON THE FOURTH DAY THE KING OF KHAISTAN TOOK HIS HOST ASIDE AND ASKED HIM WHETHER IT WAS TRUE AS HE HAD SUSPECTED THAT HE WISHED TO MARRY HIS DAUGHTER
OF GREAT HEIGHT AND DETERMINED TO THROW HIMSELF DOWN AND PUT AN END TO HIS LIFE WHEN HE GOT TO THE PLACE HE DREW BACK A FEW PACES TOOK A LITTLE RUN
FELT QUITE DAZZLED AND FEEDING ON THE GRASS WERE A QUANTITY OF LARGE FAT SHEEP WITH THE CURLIEST AND WHITEST WOOL IN THE WORLD WHAT LOVELY SHEEP WHOSE ARE THEY CRIED HELGA

SEND IN MISS CARLYLE FIRST WAS THE ANSWER WHAT IS IT CORNELIA AH YOU MAY WELL ASK WHAT SAYING THIS MORNING THAT YOU COULD NOT DINE AT SIX AS USUAL AND THEN MARCHING OFF AND NEVER FIXING THE HOUR
WHEN INSTEAD OF THE GARDEN OF ROSES IT HAD BEEN HER PERSUADER'S PLEASURE TO PROMISE HER SHE WOULD FALL INTO BUT WHICH IN TRUTH SHE HAD BARELY GLANCED AT FOR THAT HAD NOT BEEN HER MOVING MOTIVE
MISTER CARLYLE RETURNED TO HIS ROOM DELIBERATED A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN RANG HIS BELL A CLERK ANSWERED IT GO TO THE BUCK'S HEAD IF MISTER HARE AND THE OTHER MAGISTRATES ARE THERE ASK THEM TO STEP OVER TO ME THE YOUNG MAN DID AS HE WAS BID
MISTER HARE CLOSED THE GATE AND WALKED ON UP THE PATH I MUST GO RICHARD SAID BARBARA HASTILY I DARE NOT STAY ANOTHER MINUTE BE HERE AGAIN TO MORROW NIGHT AND MEANWHILE I WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
HAD NEVER MARRIED IT WAS PRETTY CERTAIN SHE NEVER WOULD PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT HER INTENSE LOVE OF HER YOUNG BROTHER KEPT HER SINGLE FOR IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICH MISTER CARLYLE HAD WANTED FOR OFFERS OTHER MAIDENS CONFESS TO SOFT AND TENDER IMPRESSIONS

BARBARA GAVE A FAINT CRY AND
YOU MAY WONDER THAT THE SUBMERGED GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS ON HIS WAY TO HIS QUARTERS THE RAVEN INN FOR HE HAD BEEN EJECTED FROM THE BUCK'S HEAD BUT HE COULD NOT HELP HIMSELF AS HE WAS DRIPPING AND SWEARING ON THE BRINK OF THE POND
I KNOW THAT NO MAN COULD HAVE RUSHED OUT IN THAT FRANTIC MANNER WITH THOSE SIGNS OF GUILT AND FEAR ABOUT HIM UNLESS HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN A BAD DEED WAS RICHARD HARE'S ANSWER IT COULD HAVE BEEN NO ONE ELSE
WITH TORTOISE SHELL RIMS LEFT BY SOME STRANGER AGES AND AGES AGO TO BE MENDED AND NEVER CALLED FOR AGAIN THIS VERY PAIR OF UGLY OLD GREEN THINGS WAS CHOSEN BY LADY ISABEL SHE PUT THEM ON THERE AND THEN

QUITE TRUE WAS HER REPLY AND I BELIEVE YOU WERE ON THE WRONG SCENT ISABEL IF IT WILL BE ANY SATISFACTION TO YOU TO HEAR IT SINCE WE ARE MUTUALLY ON THIS COMPLIMENTARY DISCOURSE IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO SMOOTH OVER FACTS
MISTER CARLYLE'S LIP CURLED HE CONTINUED HIS WAY AND DREW THE PEER WITH HIM WHAT THE DEUCE IS A GATE NOW CALLED OUT THE FOLLOWERS OF MISTER CARLYLE THAT'S LEVISON HAS HE BEEN IN A RAILWAY SMASH AND GOT DRENCHED BY THE ENGINE

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE UNDECEIVED ME THEN TO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE HOPES I WAS CHERISHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE UNBORN CHILD WERE WORSE THAN VAIN I DID NOT JUDGE SO HE REPLIED THE EXCITED STATE YOU THEN APPEARED TO BE IN
GOING DOWN HIS THROAT BY BUCKETFULS A HOARSE DERISIVE LAUGH AND A HIP HIP HURRAH BROKE FROM THE ACTORS WHILE THE JUVENILE RAGTAG IN WILD DELIGHT JOINED THEIR HANDS ROUND THE POOL
SILKY AS A HAIR AS FINE AS THE ONE BARBARA BOUGHT AT LYNNEBOROUGH AND GAVE A GUINEA FOR
ITS POSITION HAD BEEN CHANGED IN SOME LATE ALTERATIONS TO THE HOUSE YOUR ROOMS SHALL BE CHANGED TO MORROW ISABEL NO LET US REMAIN IN THESE I SHALL LIKE TO FEEL THAT PAPA WAS ONCE THEIR OCCUPANT I WON'T GET NERVOUS AGAIN
MY DARLING WHAT AILS YOU I AM TIRED I THINK SHE GENTLY ANSWERED AND COMING INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN MADE ME THINK OF PAPA I SHOULD LIKE TO GO TO MY ROOMS ARCHIBALD BUT I DON'T KNOW WHICH THEY ARE NEITHER DID MISTER CARLYLE KNOW BUT MISS CARLYLE CAME WHISKING IN AGAIN AND SAID
COMING HOME MISS CARLYLE HAVING RESOLVED UPON HER COURSE QUITTED HER OWN HOUSE AND REMOVED TO EAST LYNNE WITH PETER AND HER HANDMAIDENS IN SPITE OF MISTER DILL'S GRIEVED REMONSTRANCES SHE DISCHARGED THE SERVANTS WHOM MISTER CARLYLE HAD ENGAGED ALL SAVE ONE MAN
OUTWARDLY INTO CALMNESS AGAIN WHAT ELSE RETORTED SIR FRANCIS YOU KNOW MY DISPOSITION PRETTY WELL BY THIS TIME ISABEL AND MAY BE SURE THAT IF YOU DEAL OUT SMALL CHANGE TO ME
WAS LEFT EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN CORNELIA AND ARCHIBALD ARCHIBALD WAS NO BLOOD RELATION TO HIM BUT HE LOVED THE OPEN HEARTED BOY BETTER THAN HIS NIECE CORNELIA OF MISTER CARLYLE'S PROPERTY A SMALL PORTION ONLY WAS BEQUEATHED TO HIS DAUGHTER
I HAVE BEEN PRETTY NEARLY EVER SINCE ON MY FEET REACHING HERE I ONLY GOT A LIFT NOW AND THEN BUT RICHARD DO YOU KNOW THAT WEST LYNNE IS THE VERY WORST PLACE YOU COULD HAVE FLOWN TO
PERHAPS HE HAS SONS I ASKED NOT ANY THE MAN ANSWERED THERE'S NOBODY BUT THEIR TWO SELVES
IN ONE OF THE COMFORTABLE SITTING ROOMS OF EAST LYNNE SAT MISTER CARLYLE AND HIS SISTER ONE INCLEMENT JANUARY NIGHT THE CONTRAST WITHIN AND WITHOUT WAS GREAT THE WARM BLAZING FIRE THE HANDSOME CARPET ON WHICH IT FLICKERED
SHE BROKE OFF WITH A LOOK OF DREAD IT WOULD BE IT MIGHT BE DEATH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE CALMLY REPLIED MISTER CARLYLE THE DOORS ARE DOUBLE DOORS DID YOU NOTICE THAT THEY WERE NEVERTHELESS SHE LEFT HER CHAIR AND STOOD CLOSE TO MISTER CARLYLE
LANGUIDLY SHE TOOK HER SEAT AT THE TABLE JUST AS CAPTAIN LEVISON'S SERVANT A FRENCHMAN WHOM HE HAD ENGAGED IN PARIS ENTERED THE ROOM WITH TWO LETTERS POINT DE GAZETTE PIERRE
SHE PURSUED BENDING HER EYES DETERMINATELY UPON HIM IT MUST BE WITH ALL MY HEART RETURNED SIR FRANCIS IT IS YOU WHO HAVE THROWN OUT THE CHALLENGE MIND
SCARCELY HAD SHE CLOSED THE DOOR UPON HERSELF AND THE TRAY WHEN SIR FRANCIS LEVISON APPEARED EQUIPPED FOR TRAVELING GOOD BYE ISABEL SAID HE WITHOUT FURTHER CIRCUMLOCUTION OR CEREMONY
ON THE FLAGSHIP OF THE ADMIRAL I SPOKE TO THE OFFICERS AND ENLISTED MEN AS FOLLOWS ADMIRAL SPERRY OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE BATTLE FLEET OVER A YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE YOU STEAMED OUT OF THIS HARBOR AND OVER THE WORLD'S RIM
AND IF IT HAD BEEN THE RIGHT EYE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNABLE TO SHOOT ACCORDINGLY I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAD BECOME AN ELDERLY MAN AND WOULD HAVE TO STOP BOXING
A VETERAN POLITICIAN AND ONE OF MISTER PLATT'S RIGHT HAND MEN CERTAIN INVESTIGATIONS WHICH I MADE IN THE COURSE OF THE FIGHT SHOWED THAT THIS SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE
WHEN I WAS POLICE COMMISSIONER I HEARTILY APPROVED THE EFFORT TO GET BOXING CLUBS STARTED IN NEW YORK ON A CLEAN BASIS LATER I WAS RELUCTANTLY OBLIGED TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PRIZE RING HAD BECOME HOPELESSLY DEBASED AND DEMORALIZED
THIS WAS FURTHER REDUCED TO TEN MILES EACH MONTH WHICH IS THE PRESENT TEST AND THERE IS DANGER LEST EVEN THIS UTTERLY INSUFFICIENT TEST BE ABOLISHED I ENCLOSE A COPY OF A RECENT LETTER TO THE SURGEON GENERAL WHICH WILL SHOW OUR PRESENT DEPLORABLE CONDITION AND THE WORSE CONDITION INTO WHICH WE ARE SLIPPING BACK
THEY WERE AFTERWARDS ABANDONED NOT THROUGH PERVERSITY OR VICIOUSNESS BUT THROUGH WEAKNESS AND INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED OF PREPAREDNESS IN ADVANCE IF THE EMERGENCIES OF WAR ARE TO BE PROPERLY MET WHEN OR IF THEY ARRIVE
HE WAS MY SISTER'S FAVORITE SON AND I ALWAYS TOOK A SPECIAL INTEREST IN HIM MYSELF I DID MY BEST TO BRING HIM UP THE WAY HE OUGHT TO GO BUT THERE WAS JUST NOTHING TO BE DONE WITH HIM HIS TASTES WERE NATURALLY LOW HE TOOK TO MUSIC
WHEN I GOT BACK TO CAMP THE OLD FELLOW WAS SITTING ON A TREE TRUNK VERY ERECT WITH HIS RIFLE ACROSS HIS KNEES AND IN RESPONSE TO MY NOD OF GREETING HE MERELY LEERED AT ME I LEANED MY RIFLE AGAINST A TREE WALKED OVER TO WHERE MY BED WAS LYING
SO ONE DAY I TOOK A RIDE OF A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES MYSELF IN COMPANY WITH SURGEON GENERAL RIXEY AND TWO OTHER OFFICERS THE VIRGINIA ROADS WERE FROZEN AND IN RUTS AND IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING THERE WAS A STORM OF SNOW AND SLEET
SO AFTER GETTING SUPPER WHILE MY PONY FED ROUND I LEFT THE FIRE BURNING REPACKED THE MARE AND PUSHED AHEAD UNTIL IT LITERALLY BECAME SO DARK THAT I COULD NOT SEE THEN I PICKETED THE MARE SLEPT WHERE I WAS WITHOUT A FIRE UNTIL THE FIRST STREAK OF DAWN
AND HAPPENING TO RUMMAGE IN IT FOR SOMETHING I FOUND THE WHISKY FLASK WAS EMPTY I TURNED ON HIM AT ONCE AND ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING DRUNK IT TO WHICH HE MERELY RESPONDED BY ASKING WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO ABOUT IT THERE DID NOT SEEM MUCH TO DO SO I SAID THAT WE WOULD PART COMPANY
BUT IT IS AN ENTIRE MISREADING OF IT TO SUPPOSE THAT IT IS AIMED NARROWLY AND DEFINITELY AT ANY SINGLE POWER I FIRST DIRECTED THE FLEET OF SIXTEEN BATTLESHIPS TO GO ROUND THROUGH THE STRAITS OF MAGELLAN TO SAN FRANCISCO
OR TO KILL GRIZZLY BEARS AND LIONS BUT FOR UNFLAGGING INTEREST AND ENJOYMENT A HOUSEHOLD OF CHILDREN IF THINGS GO REASONABLY WELL
THEY WILL LOOK AT THE PICTURES AND SAY IT IS A GOOD BOOK BUT THEY WON'T READ IT THE MARINE OFFICERS ON THE CONTRARY ARE VERY MUCH INTERESTED BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TEACH THEIR MEN TO CARE FOR THEIR FEET AND THEY MUST KNOW HOW TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN
WAS ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF A SECRET OR CLANDESTINE MEETING I ALWAYS INSISTED ON GOING OPENLY SOLEMN REFORMERS OF THE TOM FOOL VARIETY WHO ACCORDING TO THEIR CUSTOM
WHEN SHOWN AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR OWN CANDIDATES BY MACHINE WARD HEELERS OF A LOW TYPE HYSTERICALLY APPLAUDED SIMILAR CORRUPT TRICKERY WHEN PRACTICED BY THESE SAME POLITICIANS AGAINST MEN WITH WHOSE POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROGRAMME THE REFORMERS WERE NOT IN SYMPATHY
FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
WHOSE BROTHER AN OFFICER IN THE ITALIAN ARMY WHO HAD DIED ON DUTY IN A FOREIGN LAND HAD ALSO GREATLY LIKED THE ARTICLE AND CARRIED IT ROUND WITH HIM
DURING YOUR WORLD CRUISE YOU HAVE TAKEN YOUR REGULAR GUNNERY PRACTICE AND SKILLED THOUGH YOU WERE BEFORE WITH THE GUNS YOU HAVE GROWN MORE SKILFUL STILL AND THROUGH PRACTICE YOU HAVE IMPROVED IN BATTLE TACTICS THOUGH HERE THERE IS MORE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THAN IN YOUR GUNNERY
AND THERE ARE COPIES OR REPRODUCTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE MOST FAMOUS HUNTING BOOKS OF THE MIDDLE AGES SUCH AS THE DUKE OF YORK'S TRANSLATION OF GASTON PHOEBUS AND THE QUEER BOOK OF THE EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN
AND A BIG TIFFANY SILVER VASE GIVEN TO MISSUS ROOSEVELT BY THE ENLISTED MEN OF THE BATTLESHIP LOUISIANA AFTER WE RETURNED FROM A CRUISE ON HER TO PANAMA IT WAS A REAL SURPRISE GIFT PRESENTED TO HER IN THE WHITE HOUSE ON BEHALF OF THE WHOLE CREW
THE MOST NOTEWORTHY INCIDENT OF THE CRUISE WAS THE RECEPTION GIVEN TO OUR FLEET IN JAPAN IN COURTESY AND GOOD BREEDING THE JAPANESE CAN CERTAINLY TEACH MUCH TO THE NATIONS OF THE WESTERN WORLD
MAY EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN O EIGHT MY DEAR CAPTAIN CONE A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE FEAT OF OUR BATTLESHIP FLEET IN ENCIRCLING SOUTH AMERICA AND GETTING TO SAN FRANCISCO
WHETHER OF PROSE OR OF POETRY THE ROOM FOR CHOICE IS SO LIMITLESS THAT TO MY MIND IT SEEMS ABSURD TO TRY TO MAKE CATALOGUES WHICH SHALL BE SUPPOSED TO APPEAL TO ALL THE BEST THINKERS
HAVE SHOWN YOURSELVES THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE AMBASSADORS AND HERALDS OF PEACE WHEREVER YOU HAVE LANDED YOU HAVE BORNE YOURSELVES SO AS TO MAKE US AT HOME PROUD OF BEING YOUR COUNTRYMEN
WE ARE SURE THAT APART FROM INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE EXISTING FLEET THIS IS THE AIM WHICH MISTER ROOSEVELT HAS IN MIND HE HAS A POLICY WHICH PROJECTS ITSELF FAR INTO THE FUTURE
THEY WERE HIS LIEUTENANTS WHO COUNSELED AND INFLUENCED HIM WHOSE ADVICE HE OFTEN FOLLOWED BUT WHO WHEN HE HAD FINALLY MADE UP HIS MIND MERELY REGISTERED AND CARRIED OUT HIS DECREES AFTER A LITTLE CONVERSATION THE SENATOR ASKED IF I HAD ANY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY
REPUTABLE MONEY CHANGERS AND AS MANY AS A THOUSAND ENGLISH SPEAKING JAPANESE COLLEGE STUDENTS ACTED AS VOLUNTEER GUIDES BESIDES JAPANESE SAILORS AND PETTY OFFICERS DETAILED FOR THE PURPOSE IN TOKYO THERE WERE A GREAT MANY EXCELLENT REFRESHMENT PLACES
I SHOULD SAY THERE WAS JUST THE PROPER MIXTURE OF FREEDOM AND CONTROL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CHILDREN THEY WERE NEVER ALLOWED TO BE DISOBEDIENT OR TO SHIRK LESSONS OR WORK AND THEY WERE ENCOURAGED TO HAVE ALL THE FUN POSSIBLE
EACH ONE OF WHICH IF REALLY READ REALLY ASSIMILATED BY THE PERSON TO WHOM IT HAPPENS TO APPEAL WILL ENABLE THAT PERSON QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY TO FURNISH HIMSELF WITH MUCH AMMUNITION WHICH HE WILL FIND OF USE IN THE BATTLE OF LIFE
AND THEN THEY STEAMED BANG INTO THE MONITOR LITTLE GIRL BROTHER DON'T YOU SINK MY MONITOR LITTLE BOY WITHOUT HEEDING AND HURRYING TOWARD THE CLIMAX AND THE TORPEDO WENT AT THE MONITOR
MOST OF THEM MY OPEN OR COVERT ENEMIES WHO LOUDLY INSISTED THAT I MUST MAKE AN OPEN FIGHT ON THE SENATOR HIMSELF AND ON THE REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION THIS WAS WHAT HE WISHED FOR AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO WAY OF UPSETTING HIM WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
OR AS HE EXPRESSED IT TRUNDLED A TENDERFOOT AND THOUGH A GOOD HUNTER WHO SHOWED ME MUCH GAME OUR EXPERIENCE TOGETHER WAS NOT HAPPY HE WAS VERY RHEUMATIC AND LIKED TO LIE ABED LATE SO THAT I USUALLY HAD TO GET BREAKFAST AND IN FACT DO MOST OF THE WORK AROUND CAMP
INCLUDING THE SO CALLED MUGWUMP PRESS TO DETERMINE THIS MATTER I APPOINTED TWO DEMOCRATIC LAWYERS MESSRS FOX AND MAC FARLANE THE LATTER FEDERAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR NEW YORK UNDER PRESIDENT CLEVELAND AND PUT THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION IN THEIR HANDS
HE SAYS THAT AT THE OUTSET ALMOST EVERY MAN IS FRIGHTENED WHEN HE GOES INTO ACTION
I WAS DEALING WITH SHREWD HARD HEADED KINDLY MEN AND WOMEN CHIEFLY CONCERNED WITH THE ABSORBING WORK OF EARNING THEIR OWN LIVING AND IMPATIENT OF FADS WHO HAD GROWN TO FEEL THAT THE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE WORD REFORMER WERE NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE WORD POLITICIAN
BOOKS ARE ALL VERY WELL IN THEIR WAY AND WE LOVE THEM AT SAGAMORE HILL BUT CHILDREN ARE BETTER THAN BOOKS SAGAMORE HILL IS ONE OF THREE NEIGHBORING HOUSES IN WHICH SMALL COUSINS SPENT VERY HAPPY YEARS OF CHILDHOOD
THEY TOOK LITTLE INTEREST IN ANY FIGHT OF MERE PERSONALITIES THEY WERE NOT INFLUENCED IN THE LEAST BY THE SILK STOCKING REFORM VIEW OF MISTER PLATT I KNEW THAT IF THEY WERE PERSUADED THAT I WAS ENGAGED IN A MERE FACTION FIGHT AGAINST HIM THAT IT WAS A MERE ISSUE BETWEEN HIS AMBITION AND MINE
ALTHOUGH HE GREETED ME AFFABLY WITH GOOD AFTERNOON COLONEL HALF AN HOUR LATER SOMEBODY ASKED HIM WHERE'S FATHER TO WHICH HE RESPONDED I DON'T KNOW BUT THE COLONEL IS TAKING A BATH
I WOULD DRAG ONE OF THE CHILDREN'S WAGONS AND WHEN THE VERY SMALLEST PAIRS OF FEET GREW TIRED OF TRUDGING BRAVELY AFTER US OR OF RACING ON RAPTUROUS SIDE TRIPS AFTER FLOWERS AND OTHER TREASURES THE OWNERS WOULD CLAMBER INTO THE WAGON ONE OF THESE WAGONS BY THE WAY
BETWEEN HONOLULU AND AUCKLAND
HE WAS NEARLY AS PLEASED AS I WAS WHEN I TOLD HIM I THOUGHT WE WOULD VOTE THE WAR A FAILURE AND ABANDON WRESTLING AFTER THAT I TOOK UP BOXING AGAIN WHILE PRESIDENT I USED TO BOX WITH SOME OF THE AIDES AS WELL AS PLAY SINGLE STICK WITH GENERAL WOOD
I SUPPOSE THERE MUST BE MANY BIG GAME LIBRARIES IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND POSSIBLY IN ENGLAND MORE EXTENSIVE THAN MINE BUT I HAVE NOT HAPPENED TO COME ACROSS ANY SUCH LIBRARY IN THIS COUNTRY SOME OF THE ORIGINALS GO BACK TO THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
BY AND BY IN SOME INEXPLICABLE WAY IT CAME TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY AFLOAT THAT THEY WERE TO BE RELEASED FROM THEIR SHAMBLES THAT SOME AMONGST THEM HAD BEEN PLOTTING FOR FREEDOM THE TWEEN DECKS HELD ITS FOUL BREATH
SEEN NONSENSE WHO IS TO SEE YOU CAPTAIN VICKERS DOCTOR PINE ANYBODY NOT THEY BESIDES
APPEARED TO STOOP DOWN OVER THE OCEAN AND AS IT STOOPED THE BILLOW ROLLED ONWARDS THE BOAT GLIDED DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS AND THE WHOLE PHANTASMAGORIA WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE TUMULTUOUS DARKNESS OF THE TEMPEST BURGESS HIS HAIR BRISTLING WITH TERROR
AND HAD STERNLY COME TO VISIT THE SICK MEN AWARE AS HE WAS THAT SUCH A VISIT WOULD NECESSITATE HIS ISOLATION FROM THE CABIN WHERE HIS CHILD LAY MISSUS VICKERS
FATE HAD IN RESERVE FOR THE CREW OF VILLAINS A LESS MERCIFUL DEATH THAN THAT OF DROWNING AIDED BY THE LIGHTNING AND THAT WONDERFUL GOOD LUCK WHICH URGES VILLAINY TO ITS DESTRUCTION VETCH BEACHED THE BOAT AND THE PARTY BRUISED AND BLEEDING
THE RED LINE OF LIGHT WHICH GLOWED FOR AN INSTANT THROUGH THE DOORWAY WAS BLOTTED OUT BY A MASS OF FIGURES ALL THE PRISON SURGED FORWARD AND BEFORE THE EYE COULD WINK FIVE TEN TWENTY OF THE MOST DESPERATE WERE OUTSIDE
AT HALF PAST NINE RICHARD DEVINE QUITTED HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE TO BEGIN THE NEW LIFE HE HAD CHOSEN AND SO
DEDICATION TO SIR CHARLES GAVAN DUFFY MY DEAR SIR CHARLES I TAKE LEAVE TO DEDICATE THIS WORK TO YOU NOT MERELY BECAUSE YOUR NINETEEN YEARS OF POLITICAL AND LITERARY LIFE IN AUSTRALIA RENDER IT VERY FITTING
SHOUTING TO THEM TO LAY TO BUT FRERE BOILING WITH RAGE AT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TABLES HAD BEEN TURNED ON HIM HAD DETERMINED NOT TO RESIGN HIS LOST AUTHORITY WITHOUT A STRUGGLE DISREGARDING THE SUMMONS HE CAME STRAIGHT ON WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE VESSEL
INSOLENT BLACKGUARDS AND THEN THE NOISE OF THE SENTRY ON THE QUARTER DECK BELOW HIM GROUNDING ARMS TURNED THE CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHTS A THIN TALL SOLDIER LIKE MAN WITH A COLD BLUE EYE AND PRIM FEATURES CAME OUT OF THE CUDDY BELOW
AND SHUDDERING SHOOK HER HEAD THE MEN ABOVE SWORE IMPATIENTLY AT THE DELAY AND THE THREE HASTENED ON DECK WHO'S TO COMMAND THE BRIG NOW ASKED UNDAUNTED BATES AS THEY CAME UP I AM SAYS JOHN REX
REACHED THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SHORE IN SAFETY OF ALL THIS NUMBER ONLY COX WAS LOST HE WAS PULLING STROKE OAR AND BEING SOMETHING OF A LAGGARD STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE CROW WHO SEEING THE IMPORTANCE OF HASTE IN PRESERVING HIS OWN SKIN PLUCKED THE MAN BACKWARDS BY THE COLLAR
AND THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE SHATTERED BOAT'S CREW CLINGING TO AN OAR HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF EM ALIVE SAID BURGESS BANDAGING HIS SPRAINED WRIST TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS AT THE NECK AND HE'S FOOD FOR THE FISHES BY THIS TIME HE WAS MISTAKEN HOWEVER
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE FLIGHT GABBETT GUIDED BY THE CROW HAD DETERMINED TO BEACH THE CAPTURED BOAT ON THE SOUTHERN POINT OF CAPE SURVILLE IT WILL BE SEEN BY THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPOGRAPHY OF COLONEL ARTHUR'S PENITENTIARY
AND UPON THE GROUP BEFORE THE BARRICADE HAD FALLEN THAT MYSTERIOUS SILENCE WHICH HAD PERPLEXED THE INMATES OF THE PRISON THEY WERE NOT PERPLEXED FOR LONG THE TWO SOLDIERS WHO WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF PINE HAD FORCED TO THE DOOR OF THE PRISON
AND OF NECESSITY DEPRIVED OF ALL RATIONAL RECREATION WHILE PUNISHMENT FOR OFFENCES WAS PROMPT AND SEVERE THE COMPANIES DRAFTED TO THE PENAL SETTLEMENTS WERE NOT COMPOSED OF THE BEST MATERIAL AND THE PAIR HAD GOOD PRECEDENT FOR THE COURSE THEY WERE ABOUT TO TAKE
RICHARD TOOK UP THE BOOK AND READ IN GOLD LETTERS ON THE COVER LORD BELLASIS THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE BODY AND RAISED IT THE SKULL HAD BEEN FRACTURED BY A BLOW BUT IT SEEMED THAT LIFE YET LINGERED
HE WAS AS ONE POSSESSED HE COULD MOVE NOR HAND NOR FOOT THE PLACE WHERE HE LAY WAS BUT DIMLY LIGHTED THE INGENUITY OF PINE HAD CONSTRUCTED A CANVAS BLIND
TO MORROW YOUR FATHER YOUR SISTERS ALL THE WORLD SHALL KNOW THE STORY YOU HAVE TOLD ME BY HEAVEN SIR YOU WILL NOT DO THIS BURST OUT THE YOUNG MAN SILENCE BASTARD CRIED SIR RICHARD
GREAT GOD CRIED BATES RUNNING UP TO HIS KNEES IN WATER AFTER THE DEPARTING BOATS WOULD YOU LEAVE US HERE TO STARVE
THEN WE MUST PUSH ON FOR IT GROWS LATE THANKS MY DEAR SIR FOR THE WE BUT I MUST GO ALONE SAID LORD BELLASIS DRYLY TO MORROW YOU CAN SETTLE WITH ME FOR THE SITTING OF LAST WEEK HARK THE CLOCK IS STRIKING NINE GOOD NIGHT
LOOKING UP HE SAW CHESHIRE'S SAVAGE FACE AND HEARD THE CLICK OF THE LOCK AS HE COCKED HIS PIECE THE TWO SOLDIERS EXHAUSTED BY THEIR LONG PULL MADE NO EFFORT TO STAY THE PROGRESS OF THE BOAT
IN THE HARWICH BOAT SHED NEARLY FIFTY YEARS BEFORE HE HAD CONTRACTED IN DEFIANCE OF PROPHESIED FAILURE TO BUILD THE HASTINGS SLOOP OF WAR FOR HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE THE THIRD'S LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY
AND BOUGHT FOR HIM A COMMISSION IN A MARCHING REGIMENT HINTING DARKLY OF SPECIAL FAVOURS TO COME HIS OPEN PREFERENCE FOR HIS NEPHEW HAD GALLED TO THE QUICK HIS SENSITIVE WIFE WHO CONTRASTED WITH SOME HEART PANGS THE GALLANT PRODIGALITY OF HER FATHER
FRERE BIT HIS THICK LIPS WITH MORTIFICATION AS HE FOLLOWED THE GIRL INTO THE CUDDY SARAH PURFOY HOWEVER TAKING THE ASTONISHED SYLVIA BY THE HAND
POOR MISSUS VICKERS WITH A WOMAN'S QUICK INSTINCT SAW THIS AND EVEN AMID HER OWN TROUBLE FOUND LEISURE TO CONSOLE HIM THE WRETCHES SHE SAID UNDER HER BREATH AS FRERE WAS FLUNG DOWN BESIDE HER TO SUBJECT YOU TO SUCH INDIGNITY
AND WITH THESE BRAVE FELLOWS I'LL TAKE HER ROUND THE WORLD THE TOUCH OF BOMBAST WAS NOT OUT OF PLACE IT JUMPED SO FAR WITH THE HUMOUR OF THE CONVICTS THAT THEY SET UP A FEEBLE CHEER AT WHICH SYLVIA FROWNED
MISSUS VICKERS PALE AND SICK WITH TERROR YET SUSTAINED BY THAT STRANGE COURAGE OF WHICH WE HAVE BEFORE SPOKEN PASSED RAPIDLY UNDER THE OPEN SKYLIGHT AND PREPARED TO ASCEND SYLVIA HER ROMANCE CRUSHED BY TOO DREADFUL REALITY
BEING A STRONG AND VIGOROUS VILLAIN HOWEVER HE CLUNG TENACIOUSLY TO HIS OAR AND EVEN UNBUCKLING HIS LEATHER BELT PASSED IT ROUND THE SLIP OF WOOD THAT WAS HIS SALVATION GIRDING HIMSELF TO IT AS FIRMLY AS HE WAS ABLE
HUDDLING TOGETHER IN ALARM AND THE PRUDENT THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE REST READY TO FIGHT OR FLY ADVANCE OR RETREAT
FELL PINIONED AS HE WAS HE COULD NOT RISE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AND RUSSEN PULLED HIM ROUGHLY TO HIS FEET WITH A COARSE LAUGH IN HIS PRESENT FRAME OF MIND THAT LAUGH GALLED HIM WORSE THAN HIS BONDS
DESPITE MISSUS VICKERS'S REITERATED OBJECTIONS ON THE SCORE OF EDUCATIONAL DIFFICULTIES HE COULD EDUCATE HER HIMSELF IF NEED BE HE SAID AND SHE SHOULD NOT STAY AT HOME SO MISSUS VICKERS AFTER A HARD STRUGGLE GAVE UP THE POINT AND HER DREAMS OF BATH TOGETHER
THERE WAS AN AWFUL MOMENT OF SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY A SKURRYING NOISE IN THE PRISON AS THOUGH A FAMILY OF RATS DISTURBED AT A FLOUR CASK WERE SCAMPERING TO THE SHIP'S SIDE FOR SHELTER
MISTER FRERE PURPLE CLUMSY AND BOUND WAS NOT AT ALL HEROIC NOW MY LADS SAYS REX WHO SEEMED TO HAVE ENDURED THE CAST OFF AUTHORITY OF FRERE WE GIVE YOU YOUR CHOICE STAY AT HELL'S GATES OR COME WITH US
I'M FOR BIZNESS AT ONCE THERE LOOK AT THAT HE ADDED WITH AN OATH AS THE FIGURE OF MAURICE FRERE APPEARED SIDE BY SIDE WITH THAT OF THE WAITING MAID AND THE TWO TURNED AWAY UP THE DECK TOGETHER IT'S ALL RIGHT YOU CONFOUNDED MUDDLEHEAD CRIED THE CROW
IF HE HAD NOT A CONSTITUTION LIKE A HORSE I DON'T THINK HE COULD LIVE OUT THE NIGHT THREE EIGHTEEN SEVEN FOUR MUTTERED REX DOT AND CARRY ONE IS THAT AN OCCUPATION FOR A GENTLEMAN NO SIR GOOD NIGHT MY LORD GOOD NIGHT
SAYS THE GIANT LICKING HIS COARSE BLUE LIPS
AS THE MEN SET THE BOAT'S HEAD TO THE WELCOME LINE OF LIGHTS THAT MARKED THE NECK A BLACK SPOT BALANCED UPON A BLACK LINE WAS SWEPT UNDER THEIR STERN AND CARRIED OUT TO SEA AS IT PASSED THEM THIS BLACK SPOT EMITTED A CRY
THE ANSWER CAME PAT TO THE QUESTION FROM THE DARK HULL OF THE BRIG BROKE A FLASH AND A REPORT AND A MUSKET BALL CUT THE WATER BESIDE THEM WITH A CHIRPING NOISE BETWEEN THE BLACK INDISTINCT MASS WHICH REPRESENTED THE BRIG
A YOUNG MAN OF TWO AND TWENTY OWNING TO NO FRIENDS AND EXISTING AMONG THEM BUT BY THE FACT OF HIS CRIMINALITY HE WAS RESPECTED AND ADMIRED
AT FIRST THE YOUNG MAN SO RUDELY ASSAILED DID NOT COMPREHEND HIS OWN DANGER HIS MIND BENT UPON ONE HIDEOUS EXPLANATION OF THE CRIME DID NOT SEE ANOTHER OBVIOUS ONE WHICH HAD ALREADY OCCURRED TO THE MIND OF THE LANDLORD OF THE THREE SPANIARDS
SHOUTED TO PUT THE BOAT ABOUT BUT HE MIGHT WITH AS MUCH REASON HAVE SHOUTED AT AN AVALANCHE THE WIND BLEW HIS VOICE AWAY AND EMPTIED IT VIOLENTLY INTO THE AIR A SNARLING BILLOW JERKED THE OAR FROM HIS HAND
HE MADE AN EFFORT TO SPEAK BUT HIS TONGUE CLOVE TO THE ROOF OF HIS MOUTH AND HIS JAWS STUCK TOGETHER HE COULD NOT RAISE A FINGER NOR UTTER A SOUND THE BOARDS OVER HIS HEAD WAVED LIKE A SHAKEN SHEET AND THE CABIN WHIRLED ROUND
TWO OTHER MEN WAITED AS EAGERLY ONE MISTER LIONEL CROFTON
HE MARRIED HIS SISTER TO A WEALTHY BRISTOL MERCHANT ONE ANTHONY FRERE
AT ANY RATE WHETHER HE FOLLOWS YOUR TRADE
I WOULD NOT GIVE MUCH FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU TRIED TO FIND THE WAY ALONE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WHEN YOU GOT ME OFF FROM BEING HUNG AFTER THAT LITTLE AFFAIR AT BRUGES
THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO CUT OFF THE SLACK OF THE ROPE THERE ARE SOME TWELVE FEET OF IT THEN WE WILL UNWIND THE STRANDS OF THAT THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX LARGE STRANDS AS FAR AS I CAN FEEL WE WILL CUT THEM UP INTO LENGTHS OF ABOUT A COUPLE OF FEET
THE VIBRATION OF THE ROPE WHEN OUR WEIGHT ONCE GETS ON IT MIGHT BE NOTICED BY ANYONE CROSSING THE COURTYARD DO YOU THINK WE HAVE SUFFICIENT BITS OF ROPE RALPH ASKED JUST ENOUGH I THINK WALTER REPLIED
THOUGH HARDLY PRESSED ON ALL SIDES
THE TOWER WAS BUT HALF A MILE DISTANT BUT BEFORE MASTER ROGER ARRIVED WALTER HAD ALREADY RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS
APPEARED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE COURTYARD HE COULD HEAR SOUNDS OF SHOUTING AND SINGING WITHIN THE CASTLE AND KNEW THAT A GREAT FEAST WAS GOING ON DESCENDING A STEP OR TWO HE HELD PARLEY WITH RALPH
SO THAT HE MAY DO VALIANT DEEDS AND WIN BACK SOME DAY THE TITLE AND HONOUR OF HIS FAMILY GEOFFREY WARD LAUGHED
AS THEY FEARED TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY LEST THEY MIGHT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF SOME ROVING BAND OF FRENCH HORSE THEY WERE TOO DOG TIRED AND WERE ASLEEP A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY LAY DOWN THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THEY AWOKE
YOU HAD BEST LIE DOWN BY THE FOOT OF THE WALL ANYONE WHO PASSES WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP
AND FORMED A LARGE ENTRENCHED CAMP NEAR THAT OF THE ENGLISH WHO THUS WHILE STILL BESIEGING VANNES WERE THEMSELVES ENCLOSED BY A VASTLY SUPERIOR FORCE THE KING OF FRANCE HIMSELF ARRIVED AT THE FRENCH CAMP THE FRENCH ALTHOUGH SO GREATLY SUPERIOR
THEY ARE SATISFIED THAT IF WE DID JUMP DOWN HERE WE ARE DROWNED AND NOW WE MUST THINK ABOUT CLIMBING UP AYE THAT WILL REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF THINKING RALPH GRUMBLED FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS SILENCE THEN WALTER SAID
EVERYONE IS INTENT ON HIS OWN PLEASURE AND WE SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN SLIPPING OUT OF THE CASTLE UNNOTICED
AND AT THE PROSPECT OF THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER WHICH WOULD ATTEND A STORM WHEN ALL HOPE OF A SUCCESSFUL RESISTANCE WAS AT AN END I FEAR WALTER SIR JOHN SAID ONE MORNING THAT THE END IS AT HAND
WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE KING'S GRANDFATHER SOME TWENTY YEARS BACK BUT AFTER ALL THEY FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY
AND THAT BERTHA WOULD SERVE HER AS GLADLY AND FAITHFULLY AS EVER SHE DID WHEN SHE WAS HER NURSE YET SHE COULD NOT BUT GREATLY FEEL THE CHANGE SHE WAS TENDERLY BROUGHT UP BEING AS I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF SIR HAROLD BROOME
A PLAIN STONE WITH THE NAME DAME ALICE SOMERS MARKING THE GRAVE THE BOY GREW AND THROVE UNTIL AT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD THERE WAS NO STRONGER OR STURDIER LAD OF HIS AGE WITHIN THE CITY BOUNDS
LAY DOWN ON THE RUSHES IN FRONT OF THE FIRE FOR IN THOSE DAYS NONE OF THE WORKING OR ARTISAN CLASS USED BEDS WHICH WERE NOT INDEED FOR CENTURIES AFTERWARDS IN USAGE BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN THE MORNING GEOFFREY WARD
HE WAS A TALL AND POWERFUL MAN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDSOME HAD NOT HIS EYES BEEN TOO CLOSELY SET TOGETHER HIS NOSE WAS NARROW AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE REMINDED WALTER OF A HAWK
GAVE HIM SO MUCH UNEASINESS THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KEEPING HIM IN ORDER SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY GEOFFREY MOREOVER HE COULD NOT BUT AGREE WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT THE PROMISE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES OFFERED A MORE FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR WALTER
THE ENGLISH FLEET IS IN SIGHT MANY OTHERS HEARD THE SHOUT AND THE TIDINGS RAN LIKE LIGHTNING THROUGH THE TOWN IN WILD EXCITEMENT THE PEOPLE RAN TO THE BATTLEMENTS AND ROOFS AND WITH CHEERING
YOUNG AS HE IS TO BE ALREADY HIGHLY SKILLED IN ARMS MEN SAY THAT HE WILL BE A WISE KING AND A GALLANT CAPTAIN SUCH A ONE AS A BRAVE SOLDIER MIGHT BE PROUD TO FOLLOW
HE IS A NOBLE PRINCE AND WILL MAKE US A GREAT KING AND THE DOINGS OF HIS MOTHER HAVE BEEN A SHAME TO US ALL HOWEVER I MEDDLE NOT IN POLITICS IF THE POOR LADY DIES AS METHINKS IS WELL NIGH CERTAIN BERTHA AND I WILL BRING UP THE BOY AS OUR OWN
AND THE TWO PUTTING ON THE STEEL CAPS AND CLOAKS WALKED QUIETLY TO THE GATE THERE WERE NONE ON GUARD AND THEY ISSUED UNMOLESTED INTO THE TOWN
AND INDEED NOT A FEW WERE THE COMPLAINTS WHICH WERE BROUGHT BEFORE GILES FLETCHER OF BRUISES AND HURTS CAUSED BY HIM YOU ARE TOO TURBULENT WALTER THE BOWYER SAID ONE DAY WHEN A HABERDASHER FROM THE WARD OF ALDERSGATE CAME TO COMPLAIN
THEN TURNING OFF FROM THE PRINCIPAL STREETS THEY MADE THEIR WAY BY QUIET LANES DOWN TO ONE OF THE GATES TO THEIR DISMAY THEY FOUND THAT THIS WAS CLOSED THE FRENCH COMMANDERS KNEW THAT SIR WALTER MANNY OR SALISBURY
HEAVY BLOWS WERE EXCHANGED AND BLOOD FLOWED FREELY FROM MANY OF THEIR HEADS AND FACES FOR IN THOSE DAYS BOYS THOUGHT LESS THAN THEY DO NOW OF HARD KNOCKS AND MANLINESS AND COURAGE WERE CONSIDERED THE FIRST OF VIRTUES
THE SOONER YOU WILL BE OUT OF YOUR TIME AND SINCE MADGE MARRIED EIGHT YEARS SINCE I HAVE BEEN LONELY IN THE HOUSE AND SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH ME GEOFFREY WARD FOUND HIS FRIEND MORE READY TO ACCEDE TO HIS REQUEST
I DON'T WANT TO BE TURBULENT WALTER SAID
YOU NEED NOT FOR THE PRESENT TROUBLE ABOUT THE CHILD'S CALLING
OFTTIMES GROWING INTO EARNEST WERE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE LADS OF THE DIFFERENT WARDS WALTER FLETCHER AS HE WAS KNOWN AMONG HIS PLAY FELLOWS
WHICH SHE NEEDS SORELY I WILL FETCH AN ARMFUL OF FRESH RUSHES FROM THE SHED AND STREW THEM HERE I WILL SLEEP IN THE SMITHY QUICK GIRL HE SAID SHARPLY
THAT MEN WHO HAVE DONE NO OTHER HARM SHOULD BE BEHEADED STILL LESS THAT THEIR HEADS AND LIMBS SHOULD BE STUCK UP THERE GIBBERING AT ALL PASSERS BY THERE ARE OVER A SCORE OF THEM AND EVERY FRESH TROUBLE ADDS TO THEIR NUMBER BUT PARDON ME
THE ROOF WAS FORMED OF AN OLD BOAT TURNED BOTTOM UPWARDS AND THIS HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BROWN TURF IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PLACE OF CONCEALMENT
OR GIVE TESTIMONY WHICH WOULD COST THE LIFE OF A FELLOW CREATURE THE CITIZENS OF LONDON WERE LOUD IN THEIR COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE DISCHARGED SOLDIERS
WHO SHOT SUCH A STORM OF BOLTS THAT GREAT NUMBERS OF THE DEFENDERS WERE KILLED THE ASSAULT WAS MADE AT A SCORE OF DIFFERENT POINTS AND THE GARRISON WAS TOO WEAK TO DEFEND ALL WITH SUCCESS
MANNED THE BREACHES AND REPULSED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ALL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE FRENCH TO CARRY THEM WHILE THE STRUGGLE WAS STILL GOING ON THE COUNTESS AIDED BY THE WIVES OF THE BURGHERS BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARING A SUMPTUOUS FEAST IN HONOUR OF HER DELIVERERS
WHEN THE GATES ARE OPEN IN THE MORNING I WILL GO FOR I HAVE A FRIEND WITHIN THE CITY WHO WILL METHINKS RECEIVE ME THE TONE OF VOICE AND THE ADDRESSING OF HIMSELF AS GOOD FELLOW AT ONCE CONVINCED THE MAN THAT THE WOMAN BEFORE HIM
PRESENTLY THE OFFICER CAME OUT FROM THE GUARD ROOM AGAIN THERE WAS A FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE LITTLE CROWD AND WALTER AND RALPH CLOSED IN TO THEIR MIDST THE GATES WERE OPENED AND WITHOUT ANY QUESTION THE VILLAGERS PASSED OUT
I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA I ONLY CAUGHT A FEW WORDS AND MAY BE WRONG
THE RUMOURS THAT WE ARE LIKELY ERE LONG TO HAVE WAR WITH FRANCE HAVE RARELY BETTERED MY TRADE SINCE THE WARS IN SCOTLAND MEN'S ARMS HAVE RUSTED SOMEWHAT
THAT NO BOY NOT YET APPRENTICED TO A TRADE
STAND YOU COWARDS RALLY ROUND YOUR LEADER AND IN HIS ENTHUSIASM THE YOUNG PRINCE URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT BUT THE ASSAILANTS WERE MASTERED
THE BUCKET HUNG AT THE WINDLASS CATCH HOLD RALPH HE EXCLAIMED
AND GENTLY AS BECOMES ONE OF GOOD BLOOD A FEW DAYS LATER LADY ALICE BREATHED HER LAST AND AT HER OWN REQUEST WAS BURIED QUIETLY AND WITHOUT POMP AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD OF THE BOWMAN
IN OCTOBER KING EDWARD HIMSELF SET SAIL WITH A GREAT ARMY AND LANDING IN BRITTANY EARLY IN NOVEMBER MARCHED FORWARD THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND SOON REDUCED PLOERMEL MALESTRAIL REDON
GAZING AS USUAL SEAWARD SUDDENLY THEY SAW HER THROW UP HER ARMS AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE CITY SHE CRIED AS SHE PERCEIVED THE ENGLISH KNIGHT I SEE THEM I SEE THEM THE ENGLISH FLEET ARE COMING RUN UP WALTER
THEY WERE TOO BUSY IN HUNTING DOWN OTHERS WHOM THEY PROCLAIMED TO BE ENEMIES OF THE KING AS THEY HAD WRONGFULLY SAID OF ROLAND WHO HAD BUT DONE HIS DUTY FAITHFULLY TO QUEEN ISABELLA AND WAS ASSUREDLY NO ENEMY OF HER SON
BELIEVING THAT YOU AND BERTHA WOULD TAKE ME IN AND SHELTER ME IN MY GREAT NEED AYE THAT WILL WE WILLINGLY GILES SAID WAS NOT BERTHA YOUR NURSE AND TO WHOM SHOULD YOU COME IF NOT TO HER BUT WILL IT PLEASE YOU TO MOUNT THE STAIRS FOR BERTHA WILL NOT FORGIVE ME IF I KEEP YOU TALKING DOWN HERE
AND HE SAW THAT IT WAS CLEFT AS IT WERE IN TWO HALVES BY ITS VEINS AND SINEWS
WHILST SHE FARED ON WITH ME TO THE EASTWARD OF BAGHDAD PRESENTLY AS I WENT ALONG BEHOLD
REPLIED SHE AND HER EYES STREAMED WITH TEARS ALLAH REQUITE THEE O WICKED OLD MAN FOR SUNDERING ME AND MY LORD HE REJOINED WANTON MINX AND WHORE THAT THOU ART THOU SHALT SEE HOW I WILL PUNISH THEE
BUT NONE IS LIKE HER I WILL NOT FORGET HE PRESSED THE PAPER INTO THE BOX AND SEALING IT UP WROTE UPON THE COVER THE FOLLOWING WORDS IN CUFIC CHARACTERS I AM NI'AMAH OF AL RABI'A OF CUFA
SO I WISH TO DEPOSIT THESE TEN THOUSAND DIRHAMS WITH THEE WHILST I MAKE MY PILGRIMAGE AND RETURN IF THE CARAVAN MARCH BACK AND THOU SEE ME NOT THEN KNOW THAT I AM DEAD IN WHICH CASE THE MONEY IS A GIFT FROM ME TO THEE BUT IF I COME BACK
FAIN SEE THEE AND FOREGATHER WITH THEE WHAT SAYEST THOU NAOMI REPLIED AND I TOO AM LONGING FOR HIS SIGHT AND DYING FOR HIS LOVE WHEREUPON THE OLD WOMAN TOOK A PARCEL OF WOMEN'S CLOTHES AND ORNAMENTS AND
AND HE ADORNED EVEN THE SHELVES WITH VESSELS OF COSTLY PORCELAIN WITH COVERS OF SILVER AND WITH GILDINGS AND STUFFS OF PRICE MOREOVER HE SET BEFORE HIMSELF VASES AND FLAGONS OF GLASS
SWINGING HER HAUNCHES AND GRACEFULLY SWAYING A SHAPE THE HANDIWORK OF HIM WHOSE BOONS ARE HIDDEN AND EACH OF THEM STOLE ONE GLANCE OF THE EYES THAT COST THEM A THOUSAND SIGHS
ON A MULE AND THEY FARED ON TILL THEY REACHED BAGHDAD WHERE HE BROUGHT HIM TO HIS OWN HOUSE AND CARRIED HIM TO THE BATH SAYING TO HIM THE GOODS AND MONEY WERE THE RANSOM OF THY LIFE O MY SON BUT IF THOU WILT HEARKEN TO ME
DO WHAT SEEMETH GOOD TO THEE WHEREUPON HE CALLED TO ONE OF HIS SLAVE GIRLS BRING ME INK CASE AND PAPER AND WROTE THESE COUPLETS I PRAY IN ALLAH'S NAME O PRINCESS MINE BE LIGHT ON ME
THE KING HEARD OF THIS WHEREUPON HE CALLED HER BEFORE HIM AND CUT OFF HER HANDS AFTER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO HER HOUSE NOW IT CHANCED AFTER A WHILE THAT THE KING SAID TO HIS MOTHER I HAVE A MIND TO TAKE A WIFE
IT SHALL BE MINE I ANSWERED BE IT AS THOU WILT AN THUS PLEASE ALLAH ALMIGHTY SO HE BROUGHT OUT A LEATHER BAG AND I SAID TO THE SERVANT FETCH THE SCALES
UPON WHICH SHE REJOINED SIT THEE DOWN AND WHEN WE WOULD BE RID OF THEE WE WILL SEND THEE AWAY SO I SAT DOWN WITH THEM TILL NEAR DAYBREAK WHEN SHE SAID TO ME O IBN MANSUR GO TO YONDER CHAMBER
SHE TURNED HER GLANCE UPON ME AND SEEING ME STANDING AT THE DOOR SAID TO ME WELL COME AND WELCOME AND ALL HAIL TO THEE O IBN MANSUR COME IN SO I ENTERED
AT THE DOOR IS A PILGRIM WIGHT WHO SEEKETH ADMISSION TO THEE QUOTH I ADMIT HIM SO HE CAME IN AND BEHOLD HE WAS A KHORASANI WE EXCHANGED SALUTATIONS AND HE SAID TO ME
BY ALLAH TO BIDE THE NIGHT WITH A BRIDE ON A BED IN A HOUSE IS FAR BETTER THAN SLEEPING IN THE STREETS AND VESTIBULES SO HE WENT WITH THEM TO THE KAZI
A DRACHM WHEREOF WOULD OVER THROW AN ELEPHANT AND HE DIPPED IT IN THE HONEY AND GAVE IT TO ALI SHAR SAYING O MY LORD BY THE TRUTH OF THY RELIGION I ADJURE THEE TO TAKE THIS SO ALI SHAR BEING ASHAMED TO MAKE HIM FORSWORN TOOK IT AND SWALLOWED IT
NAOMI AND BOTH CEASED NOT TO HONOUR HER AND SHE USED TO GO IN TO THEM MORNING AND EVENING AND ALL IN THE HOUSE RESPECTED HER TILL ONE DAY BEING ALONE WITH NAOMI SHE SAID TO HER O MY LADY
BOUGHT THEREWITH MEAT AND RICE AND CLARIFIED BUTTER AND ALL THEY REQUIRED AND WHEN IT WAS NIGHT HE LIT THE WAX CANDLES AND SAID TO HIS WIFE THE MENDICANTS
AND WENT DOWN AND WALKED ABOUT TILL THEY CAME TO THAT HOUSE WHERE HEARING MUSIC THEY WERE MINDED TO KNOW THE CAUSE THEY SPENT THE NIGHT IN JOYANCE AND HARMONY AND TELLING TALE AFTER TALE UNTIL MORNING DAWNED WHEN THE CALIPH LAID AN HUNDRED GOLD PIECES UNDER THE PRAYER CARPET
THEN HE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND SHE SAID O YOUTH
SHE TURNS TO RESTING PLACE OF TRIBE AND YEARNS THEREON TO VIEW THE SPRING CAMP LYING DESOLATE WITH RUINS OVERSTROWN SHE STANDS AND QUESTIONS OF THE SITE BUT WITH THE TONGUE OF CASE THE MOUNT REPLIES THERE IS NO PATH THAT LEADS TO UNION NONE
I WILL NOW ARISE AND GO SLEEP IN SOME PLACE AFAR FROM THEM AND LEAVE THEM TO THEIR PRIVACY ONE WITH OTHER SO I ROSE BUT SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF MY SKIRTS SAYING WHAT THINKEST THOU TO DO NOTHING BUT SO AND SO ANSWERED I
INDEED I WONDERED THAT SUCH GIFTS SHOULD BELONG TO ANY BUT THE LIKE OF THEE AND FORTUNE HATH DONE ME A GOOD TURN FOR WHICH I CANNOT THANK HER TOO MUCH BUT HAPLY THIS IS A DREAM FOR HOW COULD I HOPE THAT ONE OF THE CALIPHATE HOUSE SHOULD VISIT MY HUMBLE HOME
SO AL RABI'A SENT FOR HIM AND SEATING HIM BY HIS SIDE ENTREATED HIM WITH HONOUR AND SAID TO HIM LOOK INTO MY SON'S CASE
AND BRING ME HIS ANSWER AND HASTEN THY RETURN TO ME SO THE CHAMBERLAIN WITHOUT LOSING TIME TOOK THE DAMSEL AND SHE TEARFUL FOR SEPARATION FROM HER LORD AND SETTING OUT WITH HER ON A DROMEDARY GAVE NOT OVER JOURNEYING TILL HE REACHED DAMASCUS
JUBAYR BIN UMAYR THE SHAYBANI REJOINED HE AND WHAT HATH BEFALLEN HIM PRAISED BE ALLAH HE IS YET HERE WITH US IN THE ENJOYMENT OF PROPERTY AND RANK AND PROSPERITY EXCEPT THAT ALLAH HATH STRICKEN HIM
SHE ASKED O MY LORD IS THE MARRIAGE BOND IN THY HAND OR IN THEIRS AND HE ANSWERED O MY LADY IN MINE BUT I HAVE NOTHING SHE REJOINED THE MATTER IS EASY FEAR THOU NOTHING

HE BARED HIS FOREARMS AND SHOWED HER THAT HIS SKIN WAS ALSO LIKE VIRGIN SILVER THEREUPON SHE PRESSED HIM TO HER BOSOM AND HE PRESSED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN EMBRACED WITH CLOSEST EMBRACE THEN SHE TOOK HIM AND LYING DOWN ON HER BACK
AND MAKE SEARCH FOR HER IN ALL THE HOUSES TILL I HAPPEN ON NEWS OF HER INSHALLAH SO ALI SHAR REJOICED IN HER WORDS AND KISSED HER HANDS THEN GOING OUT SPEEDILY BROUGHT HER ALL SHE REQUIRED
AND HE BADE HIM MOUNT THE DAMSEL ON A SWIFT DROMEDARY AND BEAR HER TO DAMASCUS AND THERE DELIVER HER TO THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL ABD AL MALIK BIN MARWAN MOREOVER HE GAVE HIM A LETTER FOR THE CALIPH SAYING BEAR HIM THIS LETTER
AND HE WENT FORWARDS THROUGH THE DARK WHEN BEHOLD HE SAW THE DOOR OF A MOSQUE STANDING OPEN AND ENTERING THE VESTIBULE THERE TOOK SHELTER AND CONCEALMENT AND SUDDENLY A LIGHT APPROACHED HIM AND ON EXAMINING IT
AND RIGHT THAT I SHOULD MARRY AT NIGHTFALL AND DIVORCE IN THE MORNING THEN KISS THE KAZI'S HAND AND GIVE HIM A PRESENT AND IN LIKE MANNER KISS THE ASSESSORS HANDS AND GIVE EACH OF THEM TEN GOLD PIECES
I HEAR AND OBEY ANSWERED SHE AND WROTE THE FOLLOWING COUPLETS
SO I TOOK IT AND REPAIRING TO BUDUR'S HOUSE RAISED THE DOOR CURTAIN LITTLE BY LITTLE AS BEFORE AND LOOKING IN BEHOLD I SAW TEN DAMSELS HIGH BOSOMED VIRGINS LIKE MOONS
AND CAROUSE WITH ME THIS NIGHT

AND YOU SHALL EARN A REWARD FROM THE LORD OF ALL CREATURES WE HEAR AND OBEY ANSWERED THEY AND AT ONCE LOOSING ZUMURRUD GAVE HER TO EAT AND DRINK
AND SALUTING HER GAVE HER THE LETTER AND SHE READ IT AND WHEN SHE UNDERSTOOD IT SHE SAID LAUGHINGLY TO ME O IBN MANSUR THE POET LIED NOT WHEN HE SANG INDEED I'LL BEAR MY LOVE FOR THEE WITH FIRMEST SOUL
TO LET HIM HEAR A LITTLE MUSIC SO SHE TOOK THE LUTE AND PLAYED A MELODY
THEREUPON JUBAYR STOOD UP AND TAKING A BAG CONTAINING AN HUNDRED THOUSAND DINARS SAID O KAZI MARRY ME TO THIS YOUNG LADY AND WRITE THIS SUM TO HER MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT QUOTH THE KAZI TO HER SAY THOU
SO THEY THREW HER DOWN AND HE CEASED NOT TO BEAT HER WITH GRIEVOUS BEATING WHILST SHE CRIED FOR HELP AND NO HELP CAME THEN SHE NO LONGER IMPLORED AID BUT FELL TO SAYING ALLAH IS MY SUFFICIENCY AND HE IS INDEED ALL SUFFICIENT
AND SHE CALLED FOR SUCCOUR UPON OUR LORD MOHAMMED
SO I ROSE AND BADE THE BOY SADDLE ME THE SHE MULE ANSWERED HE O MY LORD IT IS YET BUT THE FIRST THIRD OF THE NIGHT AND INDEED WE HAVE HARDLY HAD TIME TO REST I RETURNED TO MY BED
AND BY FORCE IS SANCTIONED BY NO SCHOOL OF THE MOSLEMS THEN SAID THE YOUNG LADY'S FATHER IF THOU WILT NOT DIVORCE PAY ME THE TEN THOUSAND DINARS HER MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT
AND THE PHYSICIANS VISITED HIM AND SAID THERE IS NO REMEDY FOR HIM SAVE THE DAMSEL NOW AS HIS FATHER WAS SITTING ONE DAY BEHOLD HE HEARD TELL OF A SKILLFUL PERSIAN PHYSICIAN
BE SEATED O MY SON HE SAT DOWN AND THE KING CONTINUED
QUOTH HE I AM OF THE SONS OF ADAM A WANDERER FOR THE LOVE OF MOHAMMED WHOM ALLAH ASSAIN AND SAVE AND I HAVE STRAYED FROM MY WAY THEN HE ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WERE AND WHAT WAS THE GATE BEFORE WHICH THEY SAT
THAT HE WHO WROTE THIS TABLET WAS THE LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
SOME RIDING ON DOGS AND OTHERS AFOOT TILL THEY CAME TO THE SEA SHORE JANSHAH LOOKED FOR THE BOAT WHICH BROUGHT HIM AND FINDING IT SCUTTLED TURNED TO THE WAZIRS
BUT THOU WHENCE COMEST THOU AND WHITHER ART THOU BOUND SO HE TOLD THEM HIS STORY AND ASKED THEM OF THE ROAD THEY BADE HIM TRAVERSE THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM
A MAN OF THE PILGRIMS ONCE SLEPT A LONG SLEEP AND AWAKING FOUND NO TRACE OF THE CARAVAN SO HE ROSE UP AND WALKED ON
WHEREUPON THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL OMAR LOOKED AT HIM
WHEREFORE GAINSAY THOU NOT THE KING'S COMMANDMENT AND THAT OF THY BRETHREN AND HASAN HUNG HIS HEAD ABASHED BEFORE THE KING AND HIS FATHER THEN SAID THE KING TO THE EMIRS
IN HER ALL BEAUTIES TO CONCLUSION COME AND SHE IS THE CENTRE OF ATTRACTION TO TRAVELLER AND STAY AT HOME SHE HATH TWO LIPS OF CRAMOISY THAN CREAM SMOOTHER AND OF TASTE THAN HONEY SWEETER
SO I WOULD HAVE YOU ALL AGREE UPON SOME ONE THAT I MAY PROCLAIM HIM KING IN MY LIFETIME AND SO YE MAY BE AT EASE WHEREUPON QUOTH THEY WITH ONE VOICE WE ALL APPROVE OF THY DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND HASAN
AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY SECOND NIGHT SHE SAID
AND UPROOTETH YOU STOCK AND BRANCH REPLIED THE MAN INDEED THAT MAY BE
AND SAID DRAW ME MY HOROSCOPE AND LOOK IF ALLAH WILL GRANT ME A SON TO SUCCEED ME
QUOTH ABU AL AYNA THERE WERE IN OUR STREET TWO WOMEN ONE OF WHOM HAD FOR LOVER A MAN
TILL DAY END WHEN THE DIVAN BROKE UP AFTER THE GOODLIEST FASHION AND ALL THE TROOPS WITHDREW AND EACH WENT HIS OWN WAY THEN HE AROSE AND REPAIRED TO THE PALACE WHERE HE FOUND HIS FATHER IN LAW'S SICKNESS GROWN HEAVY UPON HIM
AND I WOULD HAVE THEE ABIDE WITH ME TILL I TELL THEE MY HISTORY AND ACQUAINT THEE HOW I COME TO BE SITTING HERE HEARING THIS MUCH HASIB AGAIN INTERRUPTED THE QUEEN OF THE SERPENTS AND SAID TO HER
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SECOND NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE PRINCE SET THEM ASHORE AND THEY SEARCHED THE ISLAND EAST AND WEST BUT FOUND NO ONE
THAT WHEN KING HASAN WAS QUIT OF THE DIVAN
AND ALL HEARTS ARE RAVISHED BY THE DAINTINESS OF HER SPRITE WHEN SHE SMILETH THOU WOULDST WEEN THE MOON SHONE OUT HER LIPS BETWEEN AND WHEN SHE EYES THEE SWORD BLADES FLASH FROM THE BABES OF HER EYES
AND SPAKE IN THE MOST ELOQUENT AND ELEGANT WORDS
AND HE REPLIED AT THY SERVICE O MY LORD QUOTH THE OLD KING MINE APPOINTED HOUR IS AT HAND BE THOU CAREFUL OF THY WIFE AND HER MOTHER
SO WE MAY DEPART TO OUR OWN LAND I HEAR AND OBEY ANSWERED THE KING
AND IT BEFITS NOT TO ADVANCE ME OVER HIM BUT ALI SAID I WILL CONSENT TO NOTHING SAVE WHATSO CONTENTETH MY BRETHREN AND THEY HAVE ALL CHOSEN AND AGREED UPON THEE
WORTHY OF THE POET'S PRAISE
HERE HE BADE THEM DISMOUNT AND THEY ALL ABODE THERE EATING AND DRINKING A SPACE OF TEN DAYS AFTER WHICH JANSHAH TOOK HIS MEN APART ONE NIGHT AND SAID I PURPOSE WE FLEE THROUGH THE VALLEY OF EMMETS
AND HE CEASED NOT FOLLOWING THEM TO THE PLACE OF EXECUTION TILL HE CAME UP WITH THEM AND SAID TO THEM HASTEN NOT TO STONE HER TILL I JUDGE BETWEEN THEM
THAT THE PREACHER WOMAN THUS PURSUED HER THEME IN THE PRAISE OF FAIR MAIDS SHE HATH TWO LIPS OF CRAMOISY THAN CREAM SMOOTHER AND THAN HONEY SWEETER ADDING AND SHE HATH A BOSOM
AND IT IS MY PURPOSE TO PROCLAIM THEE WHILST I YET LIVE AND SO MAKE AN END OF THE BUSINESS BUT HASAN STOOD UP AND KISSING THE GROUND ONCE MORE BEFORE THE KING SAID TO HIM
WHEN IT WAS THE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOURTH NIGHT SHE SAID
BULUKIYA WONDERED AND ASKED THEM WHAT IS WITHIN THE GATE AND THEY ANSWERED WE WOT NOT THEN QUOTH HE I CONJURE YOU BY THE TRUTH OF YOUR GLORIOUS LORD
AND AGAIN
AFTER WHICH THEY SAID TO HIM KNOW O KING THAT THOU SHALT BE BLESSED WITH A SON
THEN BULUKIYA LIFTED UP HIS VOICE IN SUPPLICATION TO ALLAH SAYING O LORD SEND ME THY MESSENGER GABRIEL THE FAITHFUL ONE
WITH MY SHE CAMELS HIGHLY ESTEEMED AND BY ME MOST PRECIOUS DEEMED
THUS IT IS TOLD IN HISTORY THAT ONE DAY THERE WAS SENT TO AL HAJJAJ BIN YUSUF A SLIP OF PAPER WHEREON WAS WRITTEN FEAR ALLAH AND OPPRESS NOT HIS SERVANTS WITH ALL MANNER OF OPPRESSION WHEN HE READ THIS
SO OPEN THY MOUTH THE SERPENT REPLIED DO WHATSO THOU WILT AND OPENED HIS MOUTH AND GOD PLACED HELL INTO HIS MAW SAYING KEEP IT UNTIL THE DAY OF RESURRECTION WHEN THAT TIME COMES
AND CALL UPON THEE TO PASS JUDGEMENT UPON HIM ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT OF ALLAH THEN OMAR CAST A TERRIBLE LOOK AT THE ACCUSED YOUTH AND SAID TO HIM VERILY THOU HEAREST THE COMPLAINT THESE TWO YOUNG MEN PREFER
TO REFRESH HIMSELF AMONGST ITS TREES AND PLUCK THE RIPE FRUITS WHEN THIS YOUNG MAN SLEW HIM WRONGOUSLY AND SWERVED FROM THE ROAD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHEREFORE WE DEMAND OF THEE THE RETRIBUTION OF HIS CRIME
AFTER WHICH SHE BADE A SERPENT CARRY HIM FORTH TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THE SERPENT MADE READY
AN HUNDRED YEARS OF THE SULTAN'S TYRANNY BUT NOT ONE YEAR OF THE PEOPLE'S TYRANNY ONE OVER OTHER WHEN THE LIEGES OPPRESS ONE ANOTHER ALLAH SETTETH OVER THEM A TYRANNICAL SULTAN AND A TERRIBLE KING
AND WHAT ARE THESE TWO BUILT TOMBS BETWEEN WHICH THOU SITTEST AND WHEREFORE THIS WAILING HE LOOKED AT HIM AND WEPT WITH SORE WEEPING TILL HE DRENCHED HIS CLOTHES WITH HIS TEARS THEN SAID
MADE SIGNS TO JANSHAH AND HIS MEN TO EAT THE PRINCE AND HIS FOLLOWERS CAME DOWN FROM THEIR SEATS AND ATE AND THE APES ATE WITH THEM TILL THEY WERE SATISFIED WHEN THE APES TOOK AWAY THE MEAT AND SET ON FRUITS OF WHICH THEY PARTOOK
AND THE GLORY BE TO HIM WHO IS ETERNAL AND IN WHOSE HAND ARE ANNULLING AND CONFIRMING AND OF THE TALES THEY TELL IS ONE OF THE PILGRIM MAN AND THE OLD WOMAN
EVEN TO THY SON'S SON OF MONIES AND MANSIONS
HE WEPT SORE AND REPEATED THEM TO HIS MEN THEN THEY MOUNTED AGAIN AND SURROUNDED BY THE ARMY OF THE APES WHO WERE REJOICING IN THEIR VICTORY RETURNED TO THE CASTLE
WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY FOR IT IS MY OWN AND ALL GRACIOUSNESS THOU SHOWEST HIM I TAKE FOR MYSELF BUT BEWARE OF CROSSING ME IN THIS FOR KNOW O KING BAHRWAN
JANSHAH AND HIS MEN CEASED NOT DRIVING BEFORE THE WIND AND THOSE IN SEARCH OF THEM CRUISED ABOUT FOR TEN DAYS
DOST THOU NOT SEE THAT THE GROWTH UPON HIS CHEEK IS VIOLET BLOOM THAT FROM ITS LEAVES OUTGROWS HE ABODE AWHILE IN EASE AND HAPPINESS WITH HIS FATHER WHO REJOICED AND DELIGHTED IN HIM TILL HE CAME TO MAN'S ESTATE
AND THEY ATE AND TOOK THEIR EASE AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP
AND I BOUGHT SOME OF THE PRETTIEST THINGS IN THE PLACE FOR PRESENTS AND BEAUTIFUL RARETIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE I WANTED I LIKEWISE BOUGHT FOR MYSELF A BEAST AND WE FARED FORTH AND CROSSED THE DESERTS FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY TILL I REACHED BAGHDAD
WHITHER THEY GO SO WHEN THE TIME CAME AND THEIR COMPLEXION CHANGED AND THEIR FORMS ALTERED I WENT IN TO ONE OF THE TOWNSFOLK AND SAID TO HIM ALLAH UPON THEE CARRY ME WITH THEE
I WILL MAKE THIS DAY THE BLACKEST OF THY DAYS PEACE BE ON THOSE WHO FOLLOW IN THE WAY OF SALVATION FEARING THE ISSUES OF FORNICATION AND OBEY THE HEST OF THE MOST HIGH KING LORD OF THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT HIM WHO SAITH TO A THING BE
NAY ANSWERED THE MAGHRIBI
SO HE RUBBED THE RING
AND OVERLAY IT WITH LIQUID GOLD AND FURNISH IT WITH MAGNIFICENT FURNITURE AND LET NOT THE DAY DAWN ERE THOU BE QUIT OF THE WHOLE WORK REPLIED HE THY BIDDING SHALL BE OBEYED AND SANK INTO THE EARTH
I WOULD HAVE THEE DO WITH ME AS THOU DIDST WITH MY BROTHER THEN HE GAVE HIM A SILKEN CORD SAYING BIND MY HANDS BEHIND ME AND THROW ME IN AND IF I FARE AS DID MY BROTHER
TELL ME WHO HATH WRONGED THEE THAT I MAY PROTECT THEE AGAINST HIM THOUGH IT WERE SABUR KING OF THE PERSIANS AND TURCOMANS AND DAYLAMITES QUOTH MARDAS O KING OF THE AGE HE WHO HATH WRONGED ME IS NONE OTHER THAN A YOUTH WHOM I REARED IN MY BOSOM
SHALL HAVE ANY CLAIM TO TAKE THIS BOOK SO WE ALL AGREED TO THIS CONDITION AND HE CONTINUED O MY SONS
WIELDED IT IN THE ENEMY'S FACE AND GAINED THE CITY RACE COURSE THENCE HE FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH THE FOE AND BROKE INTO THE KING'S PALACE WHERE HE MET WITH JAMAK AND SO SMOTE HIM WITH THE MACE THAT HE TOPPLED SENSELESS TO THE GROUND
HERE I WENT IN TO THE CALIPH AND AFTER SALUTING HIM AND KISSING HANDS INFORMED HIM OF ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WHEREUPON HE REJOICED IN MY SAFETY AND THANKED ALMIGHTY ALLAH AND HE BADE MY STORY BE WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF GOLD
AND DO THOU COMMAND HIM TO DO WHATEVER THOU DESIREST FOR HE WILL NOT GAINSAY THEE NOW GO TO THINE OWN COUNTRY AND TAKE CARE OF THE RING FOR BY MEANS OF IT THOU WILT BAFFLE THINE ENEMIES
ACCORDINGLY HE SPED LIKE THE WIND TO THE PERSIAN TENTS WHERE A COMPANY OF ARABS ROSE UP AND MET HIM SAYING WHO ART THOU AND WHAT DOST THOU REQUIRE HE REPLIED I AM A MESSENGER AND AN ENVOY FROM THE LORD OF THE CITY TO YOUR CHIEF
WHEREWITH THEY FLEW UNTO THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE FIRMAMENT AND NONE REMAINED IN THE CITY SAVE THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND I SAID IN MY MIND WHEN THE FIRST OF THE MONTH COMETH I WILL ASK ONE OF THEM TO CARRY ME WITH THEM
WITH WHOM HE ABODE TILL THEY HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE PILGRIMAGE RITES
TILL HE BROUGHT ME TO THE CITY AND SET ME DOWN IN MY OWN HOUSE MY WIFE CAME TO MEET ME AND SALUTING ME GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFETY AND THEN SAID BEWARE OF GOING FORTH HEREAFTER WITH YONDER FOLK NEITHER CONSORT WITH THEM
WHO GIVETH TO ALL CREATURES THEIR DAILY BREAD AND WHO OVER ALL THINGS IS OMNIPOTENT THESE FROM GHARIB SON OF KING KUNDAMIR LORD OF IRAK AND CUFA TO JAMAK IMMEDIATELY THIS LETTER REACHETH THEE
AND BE CONTENT TO TAKE A MORSEL WITH YOU IF YE ALLOW ME AUGHT TO CLOTHE ME
AND I WASHED MY HANDS AND HIS HANDMAIDS BROUGHT ME SILKEN NAPKINS WITH WHICH I DRIED THEM AND WIPED MY MOUTH ALSO THE SHAYKH SET APART FOR ME AN APARTMENT IN A PART OF HIS HOUSE
THE MAMELUKES ALSO DRESSED THEM SELVES AND KISSED JUDAR'S HANDS AND HE AND HIS BROTHERS ARRAYED THEMSELVES IN THE ROBES THE JINNI HAD BROUGHT THEM
HE HATH BUT TO FACE THE PLANISPHERE TOWARDS THE SUN'S DISC SAYING LET SUCH A CITY BE BURNT AND THAT CITY WILL BE CONSUMED WITH FIRE
I DESIRE TO LOOK UPON THIS SON OF AN ADULTERESS GHARIB THAT I MAY DESTROY HIM AND CAUSE HIM TASTE ALL MANNER OF TORMENTS THEN HE BADE GIVE MARDAS TO HIS DAUGHTER'S DOWRY
AND NEXT MORNING HE TOOK HIS NET AND GOING DOWN TO LAKE KARUN STOOD THERE AND WAS ABOUT TO CAST HIS NET WHEN BEHOLD THERE CAME UP TO HIM A SECOND MAGHRIBI RIDING ON A SHE MULE MORE HANDSOMELY ACCOUTRED
BUT COULD NOT AVAIL AGAINST THE DOG THY BROTHER FOR THAT HIS TROOPS ARE MANY AND MY TROOPS ARE FEW REPLIED GHARIB O UNCLE HERE AM I COME TO AVENGE MY SIRE AND BLOT OUT OUR SHAME AND RID THE REALM OF AJIB
AND BE NOT IGNORANT OF ITS PUISSANCE O MY LORD QUOTH JUDAR WITH THY LEAVE I WILL SET OUT HOMEWARDS QUOTH THE MAGHRIBI SUMMON THE JINNI AND MOUNT UPON HIS BACK
WHEREUPON I GAVE MYSELF UP FOR LOST AND SAID
AS SOON AS WE HAD MADE FAST WE LANDED AND I TOOK THE PRESENT AND THE LETTER AND GOING IN WITH THEM TO THE KING KISSED GROUND BEFORE HIM WHEN HE SAW ME HE SAID WELL COME O SINDBAD BY ALLAH OMNIPOTENT WE WERE LONGING TO SEE THEE
FOR SINCE YOUR FATHER'S DEATH I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY GOOD IN YOU
AND DROVE AT SA'ADAN THE GHUL SAYING WOE TO THEE O SA'ADAN WHEN THE GIANT HEARD THIS HE WAXED FURIOUS BEYOND MEASURE AND RAISING HIS TREE CLUB AIMED AT THE INFIDEL A BLOW THAT HUMMED THROUGH THE AIR THE AMALEKITE MET THE STROKE WITH HIS MACE
THEN I WENT OUT IN HIS COMPANY WITHOUT TELLING ANY OF MY FAMILY
AND HIS TROOPS POURED FORTH LIKE THE SURGING SEA AND PASSED THE NIGHT WITH INTENTION OF SLAUGHTER AS SOON AS DAWNED THE DAY
AND ALL RODE OUT TO THE CAMP WHENCE GHARIB CAME FORTH AND MET HIM AND THEY EMBRACED AND SALUTED EACH OTHER AFTER WHICH GHARIB CARRIED HIM TO HIS TENTS AND THEY SAT DOWN ON BEDS OF ESTATE
FOR OUR SAKE HOWEVER THOU WILT GO THIS TIME AND CARRY OUR PRESENT AND OUR LETTER TO HIM OF SARANDIB AND INSHALLAH BY GOD'S LEAVE THOU SHALT RETURN QUICKLY
WHERE ARE THE TWO SLAVES I SENT WITH THEE AND SHE ANSWERED THEY SLEW EACH OTHER ON MY ACCOUNT WHEREUPON AJIB BARED HIS BLADE AND SMOTE HER AND CUT HER IN TWAIN THEN THEY DRAGGED HER AWAY AND CAST HER OUT
WHERE HIS PEOPLE MADE MUCH OF ME AND SEATING ME IN A PLEASANT PLACE SET RICH FOOD BEFORE ME WHEREOF I ATE MY FILL AND RETURNED THANKS TO GOD THE MOST HIGH FOR MY DELIVERANCE THEREUPON HIS PAGES FETCHED ME HOT WATER
BUT TROUBLE AND SUSPICION ENTERED AJIB'S HEART AND HE CRIED O MARDAS GIVE ME THY DAUGHTER TO WIFE HE REJOINED SHE IS ONE OF THINE HANDMAIDS I GIVE HER TO THEE TO WIFE AND I AM THY SLAVE SAID AJIB
WHEN I SMOTE THE SERPENT ON THE HEAD WITH MY GOLDEN STAFF SHE CAST THE MAN FORTH OF HER MOUTH THEN I SMOTE HER A SECOND TIME AND SHE TURNED AND FLED
O MY LORD THE PILGRIM ALLAH UPON THEE TELL ME THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE TWO DROWNED MEN AND THE TRUTH ANENT THESE TWO FISHES AND THE JEW
WHITHER HE PURSUED THEM BUT COULD NOT PREVAIL OVER THEM BY REASON OF THEIR STEALING INTO THAT LAKE WHICH WAS GUARDED BY A SPELL
NOR TURN IT SHOREWARDS TILL IT STOPPED WITH ME AT A GREAT AND GOODLY CITY GRANDLY EDIFIED AND CONTAINING MUCH PEOPLE AND WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK SAW ME ON THE RAFT DROPPING DOWN WITH THE CURRENT
TILL THERE CAME TO THEM THE DESTOYER OF DELIGHTS AND THE SUNDERER OF SOCIETIES AND THE SHATTERER OF PALACES AND THE CATERER FOR CEMETERIES TO WIT THE CUP OF DEATH
ACCORDING TO THE VERSION OF THE CALCUTTA EDITION WHICH DIFFERS IN ESSENTIAL FORM FROM THE PRECEDING TALE KNOW O MY BROTHERS AND FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS ALL THAT WHEN I LEFT VOYAGING AND COMMERCING I SAID IN MYSELF
QUOTH GHARIB WHAT IS THINE ERRAND AND QUOTH SABA AL KIFAR I AM AN ENVOY FROM THE LORD OF THE CITY OF AL JAZIRAH AL DAMIGH BROTHER OF KING KUNDAMIR LORD OF THE CITY OF CUFA AND THE LAND OF IRAK WHEN GHARIB HEARD HIS FATHER'S NAME
RISE AND GET THEE READY TO TRAVEL WITH THE TRADERS EN ROUTE TO THY COUNTRY THEY HAD BOUGHT A NUMBER OF TUSKS WHICH THEY HAD BOUND TOGETHER IN LOADS AND WERE EMBARKING THEM WHEN MY MASTER SENT ME WITH THEM PAYING FOR MY PASSAGE AND SETTLING ALL MY DEBTS
SO THE JINNI FETCHED ALL THAT WAS NEEDED AND CLAD THE FEMALE SLAVES SAYING TO THEM THIS IS YOUR MISTRESS KISS HER HANDS AND CROSS HER NOT
ALSO CIRCUMAMBULATING AND WHEN THE MAGHRIBI CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM HE SALUTED HIM AND ASKED HIM OF HIS STATE WHEREUPON JUDAR WEPT
O SON OF MY BROTHER THOU HAST TWO BLOOD WREAKS TO TAKE THAT OF THY FATHER AND THAT OF THY MOTHER ASKED GHARIB AND WHAT AILETH MY MOTHER
BLEW A BLAST ON A TRUMPET THAT ALL IN THE CITY HEARD IT AND FELL UPON THE STRANGER AND SLEW HIM EXCEPT THEY EMBRACED THEIR CREED
AND THOU ART MASTER THEREOF AND I IMPOSE NOT ON THE KING A DIFFICULTY NOR AM I JINN DEMENTED THAT I SHOULD CRAVE OF THE KING
WITH SELLE AND TRAPPINGS OF GOLD INLAID WITH PEARLS AND JEWELS THEN HE BADE HIS GRANDEES AND CAPTAINS MOUNT ON HIS SERVICE AND ESCORT HIM TO HIS FATHER'S PRESENCE AND CHARGED HIM TELL HIS SIRE
AND EMBRACING HIM KISSED HIM BETWEEN THE EYES AND SAID TO HIM
TELL ME THEREFORE WHY THIS WEEPING AND WHEREFORE THINE AFFLICTION NEVERTHELESS THE KING NEITHER OPENED HIS MOUTH NOR RAISED HIS HEAD BUT CEASED NOT TO WEEP AND CRY WITH A LOUD CRYING AND LAMENT WITH EXCEEDING LAMENTATION AND EJACULATE
WITH RED BILL AND LEGS CAPTIVATING THE SIGHT AND BEWILDERING THE THOUGHT AND LOOKING THEREAT SAID IN HIMSELF VERILY YONDER IS A BEAUTIFUL BIRD NEVER SAW I ITS LIKE IN FAIRNESS OR FORM
AND WHEN NONE ABODE WITH HIM BUT KAYLAJAN AND KURAJAN WHO NEVER LEFT HIM HE SAID TO THEM CAN YE CARRY ME TO CUFA THAT I MAY TAKE MY PLEASURE IN MY HARIM AND BRING ME BACK BEFORE THE END OF THE NIGHT
AND HE WENT IN TO SUMMON HER AND SAID O MY LADY THE KING DESIRETH THY PRESENCE THAT THOU MAYST DIVERT THYSELF WITH THE SIGHT OF A BIRD HE HATH BOUGHT WHEN WE SET ON THE FOOD
SO KURAJAN TOOK UP JAMRKAN AND SA'ADAN
AND COME FORTH AND WAS SLAYING MEN AND OVERTHROWING WARRIORS WHEN SHE SAW HIS PROWESS HER HEART WAS DROWNED IN THE LOVE OF HIM AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF
NOW FOUR OF THEM WERE ABSENT FOUR MONTHS AND SEARCHED BUT FOUND NOTHING SO THEY RETURNED AND TOLD THEIR MASTER WHOSE BREAST WAS STRAITENED THAT THEY HAD RANSACKED TOWNS AND CITIES AND COUNTRIES FOR THE THING HE SOUGHT BUT HAD HAPPENED UPON NAUGHT THEREOF
RAISED HIS VIZOR OF MAIL AND SAHIM KNEW HIM AND CRIED OUT SAYING THIS IS YOUR KING
THE MOSLEMS REJOICING IN THEIR SAFETY DONNED THEIR MAILS AND TOOK HORSE WHILE THE KETTLE DRUMS BEAT A POINT OF WAR AND THE MISCREANTS ALSO DREW UP IN LINE
THEN HE TORE THE LETTER IN PIECES AND THREW IT AWAY WHICH VEXED SAHIM AND HE CRIED OUT UPON AJIB SAYING ALLAH WITHER THY HAND FOR THE DEED THOU HAST DONE WITH THIS AJIB CRIED OUT TO HIS MEN SAYING
AND KAYLAJAN SAID TO KURAJAN I WILL CARRY HIM GOING AND THOU COMING BACK
AND ALL SHALL BE WELL WITH YOU BUT IF YE REFUSE YOU SHALL REPENT IT SO THEY PRONOUNCED THE PROFESSION OF THE FAITH AND WERE ENROLLED AMONG THE PEOPLE OF FELICITY
THEY REPLIED O KING OF THE AGE THERE REMAIN NOR SHIPS NOR BOATS NOR THOSE WHO WERE THEREIN FOR THEY ARE ALL DROWNED AND BECOME FOOD FOR FISHES NOW WHEN HE HEARD THIS HE CRIED ALOUD
AT THE UPPER END WHEREOF WAS A WOODEN BENCH UNDER AN OPEN LATTICE WINDOW WHENCE EXHALED A SCENT OF MUSK I ENTERED THE PORCH AND SITTING DOWN ON THE BENCH WOULD HAVE STRETCHT ME AT FULL LENGTH
NIGHT AND DAY A GREAT WHILE TILL THEIR VICTUAL WAS SPENT AND THEY SAW THEMSELVES SHENT AND WERE REDUCED TO EXTREME HUNGER AND THIRST AND EXHAUSTION WHEN BEHOLD SUDDENLY THEY SIGHTED AN ISLAND FROM AFAR
WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SIXTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING
WHEN THE TWO PARTIES CAME TO BLOWS SOME OF KING AL SAMANDAL'S PAGES FLED
COME DO THY BUSINESS HE REPLIED TIS WELL AND MOUNTING ON HER BREAST SEIZED HER BY THE NECK AND BRAKE IT
AND THEY ALL BECAME TRUE BELIEVERS AFTER WHICH JAMAK RETURNED TO THE CITY AND DESPATCHED THENCE
BUT WELCOME FAIR WELCOME I CRIED TO THE SPRIGHT BUT THE THIRD I PREFERRED FOR SHE SAID IN REPLY WITH EXPRESSION MOST APPOSITE EXQUISITE MY SOUL AND MY FOLK I ENGAGE FOR THE YOUTH MUSK SCENTED I SEE IN MY BED EVERY NIGHT
PLACING MYSELF UNDER THY HAND BUT AJIB SAID I WILL NOT LEAVE MY FAITH SO
THE KING ENVIED HIM AND SAID IN HIMSELF
WHICH SHE HAD NOT DONE WERE HE NOT DEARER TO HER THAN HER SPRITE SAID THE CALIPH THOU DIDST WELL O ASMA'I AND GAVE HIM OTHER THREE HUNDRED DUCATS IN PAYMENT OF HIS STORY AND I HAVE HEARD A TALE CONCERNING
THE BLACKAMOORS WHO HAD CAPTURED THE PRINCE AND HIS MAMELUKES SET THEM BEFORE THE KING AND SAID TO HIM WE FOUND THESE BIRDS AMOUNG THE TREES AND THE KING WAS SHARP SET SO HE TOOK TWO OF THE SERVANTS AND CUT THEIR THROATS AND ATE THEM
LORD OF THIS WORLD AND OF THE NEXT THEN ZALZAL SALUTED GHARIB AND GAVE HIM JOY OF HIS SAFETY AND GHARIB SAID TO HIM HOW KNOWEST THOU OF MY CASE AND HE REPLIED O MY LORD
ASSEMBLING THE MEN UNDER THEIR COMMAND EXPLAINED WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND EXPOUNDED AL ISLAM TO THEM AND THEY ALL PROFESSED EXCEPT A FEW WHOM THEY PUT TO DEATH AFTER WHICH THEY RETURNED
THAT HE MAY LIE IN MY BOSOM THE REST OF MY LIFE THEN SHE CRIED TO HER MEN HOLD ALOOF FROM HIM AND LEAVE HIM TO HIMSELF THEN GOING UP TO HIM SHE MUTTERED CERTAIN MAGICAL WORDS WHEREUPON HIS ARM BECAME BENUMBED HIS FOREARM RELAXED
THE KING CRIED THIS IS WELL SEEN AND MY BREAST IS BRAODENED BY THIS THY SPEECH BUT WHERE SHALL WE FIND A MESSENGER BEFITTING THIS GRAVE MATTER FOR THAT THIS SOLOMON IS NO KINGLET AND THE APPROACHING HIM IS NO LIGHT AFFAIR
THE MINISTER SPEAKETH SOOTH AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINTH NIGHT SHE CONTINUED
STRANGE BUT TRUE WHICH WE WILL SET OUT IN ORDER DUE AND IT WAS THUS WHEN AJIB RETURNED TO HIS CAMP ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT HE CALLED ONE OF HIS GUARDSMEN BY NAME SAYYAR AND SAID TO HIM
BY ALLAH I HAVE SEEN HER MANY AND MANY A TIME AND SHE WAS MY COMPANION WHEN WE WERE LITTLE ONES BUT NOW WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER FOR CONSTRAINT OF DISTANCE NOR HAVE I SET EYES ON HER FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS
AND SA'ID REJOINED COME READ THIS WRITING ON THE CROWN SO SAYF AL MULUK READ IT AND CRIED OUT FROM HIS HEART'S CORE AND VERY VITALS SAYING ALAS ALAS ALAS
SO ARABS AND AJAMS MOUNTED HORSE AFTER CLOTHING THEMSELVES IN HAUBERKS OF IRON AND SKIRTING THEMSELVES IN STRAIGHT KNIT MAIL AND SALLIED FORTH TO THE FIELD
AFTER WHICH HE ROSE TO THE SURFACE AND SWAM FOR TWO DAYS AND TWO NIGHTS TILL HIS STRENGTH FAILED HIM AND HE MADE CERTAIN OF DEATH BUT ON THE THIRD DAY AS HE WAS DESPAIRING HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF AN ISLAND STEEP AND MOUNTAINOUS SO HE SWAM FOR IT AND LANDING WALKED ON INLAND
UNLESS THOU FARE FORTH TO THY BROTHER AND BRING HIM TO ME IN HASTE I WILL CUT OFF THY HEAD AND MAKE AN END OF THEE SO AJIB TOOK HEART
BUT HE BARED BLADE AND FELL UPON THEM AND SLEW OF THEM MORE THAN FIFTY BRAVES AFTER WHICH HE CUT HIS WAY OUT THOUGH BATHED IN BLOOD
THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT I TAKE HER TO WIFE SO JA'AFAR REPAIRED TO HER FATHER AND SAID TO HIM THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL HATH A MIND TO THY DAUGHTER HE REPLIED
WHEREFORE I WILL NOT RETURN TO MY MOTHER NOR CONSULT HER AND HE WEPT BEFORE HIM AND PRESENTLY ADDED I WILL GO WITH THEE AND TELL HER NOT AND AFTER WILL RETURN
THIS IS TOO MUCH OF A JEST HOW SHOULD HE BE OTHER THAN A BIRD AND SHE O KING BY ALLAH I DO NOT JEST WITH THEE
SHE ENTERED HER CHAMBER AND DOFFING ALL THAT WAS UPON HER OF RICH RAIMENT DONNED MOURNING APPAREL AND RAISED LAMENT FOR HER FATHER IT WAS SAID TO HER WHAT IS THE REASON OF THIS AND SHE REPLIED MY FATHER IS DEAD
SO SHE WENT FORTH FROM THAT ISLAND AND BROUGHT HIM TO ANOTHER ABOUNDING IN TREES AND FRUITS AND RILLS AND SETTING HIM DOWN THERE RETURNED TO HER MISTRESS AND TOLD HER I HAVE LEFT HIM ON THE THIRSTY ISLAND
THOU SPEAKEST SOOTH O SA'ADAN BUT AJIB PASSED THE NIGHT IN JOY AND HE SAID TO HIS MEN MOUNT YE ON THE MORROW AND FALL UPON THE MOSLEMS SO SHALL NOT ONE OF THEM BE LEFT ALIVE
AND METHOUGHT MY SERVANTS HAD SOUGHT TO PLEASURE ME BY ADMITTING A MAN OF SUCH GOOD BREEDING AND FINE CULTURE THEN I ASKED HIM ART THOU FOR MEAT AND HE ANSWERED I HAVE NO NEED OF IT AND FOR DRINK QUOTH I AND QUOTH HE THAT IS AS THOU WILT
BY AND BYE I WAS BORN AND WAS BROUGHT UP BY MY GRANDFATHER IN ONE OF HIS GREAT HOUSES HERE ARE THE RINGS YOU GAVE TO MY MOTHER AND HERE IS THE CROSS AND THESE WILL PROVE IF I AM YOUR SON OR NOT
AND THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT BE MORE LUCKY THE THIRD TIME SO BACK HE WENT TO THE OLD PLACE WILT THOU WED ME FARMER'S DAUGHTER HE SAID TO THE YOUNGEST INDEED I WILL WED THEE A PRETTY CREATURE IS THE HOODIE ANSWERED SHE
RAN THROUGH HIM FROM HIS COLLAR RIGHT DOWN TO HIS BOOTS IT IS BETTER FOR ME TO BEAT THE DRUM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AGAIN AND SO HE BEGAN TO BEAT IT
THEY FORGOT IN THEIR FRIGHT WHAT THEY WERE THERE FOR AND FLED TO HIDE THEMSELVES AND THE NAKED MAN STOOD ALONE AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN VERY SOON A MAN CAME OUT OF THE WOOD AND SPOKE TO HIM DO YOU KNOW ME
WHEN THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING AND THE JUDGES THE HALL WAS FULL TO OVERFLOWING WHEN THE PRISONER ENTERED IT AND ALL MARVELLED AT THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS FACE THE KING INQUIRED IF HE HAD ANY EXCUSE TO PLEAD FOR THE HIGH TREASON HE HAD COMMITTED
I DON'T SEE ANY WOLF TAKE CARE
IT IS I THE BROWNIE OF THE LAKE REPLIED THE VOICE BUT WHERE ARE YOU INQUIRED JEGU LOOK CLOSE AND YOU WILL SEE ME AMONG THE REEDS IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE GREEN FROG I CAN TAKE HE ADDED PROUDLY ANY SHAPE I CHOOSE
AND A HANDSOMER MAN OR A MORE BEAUTIFUL HOODIE NEVER WAS SEEN THE GIRL LOVED THEM BOTH AND NEVER WISHED FOR THINGS TO BE DIFFERENT BY AND BYE THEY HAD A SON AND VERY PLEASED THEY BOTH WERE
AND HIS FACE WAS SO WHITE AND DESPERATE THAT NONE OF HIS COMPANIONS DARED SPEAK TO HIM THE SAD LITTLE PROCESSION HAD PASSED SOME HOURS IN THIS MANNER WHEN NEAR THE GATE OF A MONASTERY AN OLD WOMAN APPEARED ROUND A CORNER
WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE FOLLOW ME AT ONCE
SO WHEN HE BEHELD A WOMAN WHOM HE DID NOT KNOW COMING ALONG THE STREET HOPE SPRANG UP IN HIM WILL YOU COOK THE WEDDING FEAST IN PLACE OF ME HE SAID AND I WILL PAY YOU WELL WHEN I RETURN FROM THE RACE GLADLY SHE AGREED
MANAWYDDAN THE PRINCE AND HIS FRIEND PRYDERI WERE WANDERERS
WHO SPENT ALL HER DAYS IN LOOKING AFTER HER FARM WITH THE HELP OF HER NIECE TEPHANY EARLY AND LATE THE TWO MIGHT BE SEEN IN THE FIELDS OR IN THE DAIRY MILKING COWS MAKING BUTTER FEEDING FOWLS WORKING HARD THEMSELVES AND TAKING CARE THAT OTHERS WORKED TOO
AND MY WET LINEN TO BE STRETCHED ON THE HEDGE TO DRY AND SHE NEED NEVER GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT TO THE MATTER IF SHE FOUND THE RYE BREAD TOO HARD TO BAKE OR THE OVEN TAKING TOO LONG TO HEAT SHE JUST MURMURED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY SIX LOAVES ON THE SHELF ABOVE THE BREAD BOX
THREW HIS DRUM FAR AWAY TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND RAN
WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND HER YOU MUST CONTRIVE TO GET HOLD OF THE NET OF STEEL THAT HANGS FROM HER WAIST AND SHUT HER UP IN IT FOR EVER BUT WHERE AM I TO FIND A YOUNG MAN'S CLOTHES ASKED SHE I WILL SHOW YOU HE REPLIED
SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN WHEN THE HORSE APPEARED AND MOUNTING ON HIS BACK SHE STARTED FOR THE VILLAGE WHERE THE WEDDING WAS TO BE HELD AT FIRST SHE WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH THE CHANCE OF A HOLIDAY FROM THE WORK WHICH SHE HATED THAT SHE NOTICED NOTHING
BUT DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF IT WAS NOT QUITE SO BAD AS THAT FOR THE WOLF WAS QUITE A FRIENDLY ONE HE CERTAINLY JUMPED ON TO WALTER BUT HE ONLY SHOOK HIS COAT AND RUBBED HIS NOSE AGAINST HIS FACE
LORD SAID THE PRIEST SOONER THAN SEE THEE TOUCH THIS REPTILE I WOULD PURCHASE ITS FREEDOM I WILL NEITHER SELL IT NOR SET IT FREE IT IS TRUE THAT A MOUSE IS WORTH NOTHING
WHY YOU MUST BE A HUNDRED AT LEAST OH NO IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE HE SPOKE WITHOUT THINKING BUT THE FLASH OF ANGER WHICH DARTED FROM HER EYES MADE HIM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE HOWEVER ALL SHE SAID WAS AS YOU LIKE SINCE YOU REJECT ME LET THE CROWS HAVE YOU
AND IN FIFTEEN DAYS HE WOULD BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL BEFORE THE HIGHEST JUDGES IN THE LAND THE YOUNG MAN LEFT THE KING'S PRESENCE SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS AND ACCOMPANIED BY MANY OF HIS FRIENDS FOR HE WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE
YOU SEE I LIKE SO MUCH BETTER TO FIGHT WITH BEARS
IT IS SO HARD TO LEAVE THE WORLD AND GO OUT INTO THE DARKNESS YOU WILL NOT NEED TO DO THAT ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN YOU HAVE ONLY GOT TO MARRY ME AND YOU WILL SOON BE FREE MARRY YOU EXCLAIMED HE BUT BUT I AM NOT YET TWENTY AND YOU
MY NAME IS HOUARN HE ANSWERED
IT IS MORE MANLY SAID JONAS NO IT IS BETTER FOR YOU TO COME TOO SAID WALTER PERHAPS THERE ARE MANY NO I HAVE NOT TIME SAID JONAS AND BESIDES
A CLASP KNIFE WITH A BONE HANDLE TO CUT OFF THE EARS OF THE WOLVES AS SOON AS HE HAD KILLED THEM FOR HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE CRUEL TO DO THAT WHILE THEY WERE STILL LIVING
THE GIRL WAS WILLING AND THE FATHER WAS WILLING AND VERY SOON THEY WERE MARRIED AND WENT TO LIVE AT THE FARM BY AND BYE THE SEASON CAME WHEN THEY MUST CUT THE PEATS AND PILE THEM UP TO DRY SO THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE FIRES IN THE WINTER
AND THROUGH EVERY VILLAGE HE PASSED THEY FOLLOWED HOUARN IN CROWDS MISTAKING HIM FOR A GENTLEMAN BECAUSE THERE WERE NO HOLES IN HIS CLOTHES THERE IS NO FORTUNE TO BE MADE HERE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF IT IS A PLACE FOR SPENDING AND NOT EARNING I SEE I MUST GO FURTHER
THERE WAS ANYTHING LURKING BEHIND THE STONES HE QUITE THOUGHT SOMETHING MOVED AWAY THERE IN THE DITCH
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE PIN IN HER HANDS SHE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS DREAMING BUT BY THAT TOKEN SHE KNEW IT WAS NO COMMON OLD WOMAN WHO HAD GIVEN IT TO HER BUT A FAIRY WISE IN TELLING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE DAYS TO COME
INDEED BARBAIK HAD ONLY TO EXPRESS A WISH FOR IT TO BE SATISFIED IF THE WIND WAS COLD OR THE SUN WAS HOT AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO OUT LEST HER COMPLEXION SHOULD BE SPOILT SHE NEED ONLY TO RUN DOWN TO THE SPRING CLOSE BY AND SAY SOFTLY I SHOULD LIKE MY CHURNS TO BE FULL
SHE WOULD WEAR THE BEAUTIFUL DRESSES THAT CAME WHEN SHE WISHED FOR THEM
HE WAS WONDERFULLY BRAVE WHEN HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF HIS COMPANIONS OR AT HOME WITH HIS BROTHERS AND SISTER
WHERE THE COMPANY OF YOUNG MEN REMAINED SILENT THEN HE CAME BACK HIS FACE WHITE AND STERN I TELL YOU HE SAID AND IT IS THE SOLEMN TRUTH THAT I WOULD RATHER YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT THE PRINCE WAS DEAD THOUGH HE IS MY ONLY SON
WALTER IMMEDIATELY REGAINED COURAGE IT WAS WELL I TOOK MY DRUM WITH ME HE THOUGHT AND WENT STRAIGHT ON WITH COURAGEOUS STEPS VERY SOON HE CAME QUITE CLOSE TO THE KILN
SUPPOSE THAT PACK SADDLE WERE TO FALL AND KILL ME HOW DREADFUL IT WOULD BE AND SHE SAT DOWN JUST UNDER THE PACK SADDLE SHE WAS SO MUCH AFRAID OF AND BEGAN TO CRY NOW THE OTHERS OUT ON THE MOOR GREW HUNGRIER AND HUNGRIER
AND THE MAN BECAME A HOODIE AGAIN AND FLEW AWAY THE TWO SISTERS RETURNED HOME BUT THE WIFE FOLLOWED THE HOODIE SOMETIMES SHE WOULD SEE HIM ON A HILL TOP AND THEN WOULD HASTEN AFTER HIM HOPING TO CATCH HIM
COULD THAT REALLY BE HIS WIFE THAT BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE THE PRINCE WAS STILL GAZING IN SURPRISE WHEN THE LADY OPENED HER EYES AND SMILED AT HIM YES I REALLY AM YOUR WIFE SHE SAID AS IF SHE HAD GUESSED HIS THOUGHTS
LET US GO INTO ENGLAND IT IS EASIER FOR US TO LIVE THERE SO THEY SET FORTH WHAT CRAFT WILT THOU FOLLOW ASKED KIEVA AS THEY WENT ALONG I SHALL MAKE SHOES AS ONCE I DID REPLIED HE
IN A MOMENT SHE HEARD DENIS WHISTLING GAILY AND AS HER AUNT WAS SAFELY COUNTING HER CABBAGES SHE HURRIED OUT TO MEET HIM THE YOUNG MAN WAS STRUCK DUMB BY HER TALK THERE WAS NOTHING THAT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW AND AS FOR SONGS
THEY BESOUGHT ME MUCH TO CHANGE THEM INTO MICE
WHO IS AS POOR AS A RAT WHEN THERE ARE
VERY SOON SHE LED HER VISITOR INTO THE GREAT HALL WHERE WINE AND FRUIT WERE ALWAYS WAITING AND ON THE TABLE LAY THE MAGIC KNIFE LEFT THERE BY HOUARN
AND MY WIFE TOLD ME THAT I MYSELF WAS DEAD
SO ONE DAY THE BROWNIE ASKED JEGU IF HE MIGHT BRING HIS FRIENDS TO HAVE SUPPER IN THE GREAT BARN AND WHETHER HE WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DANCE THERE OF COURSE JEGU WAS ONLY TOO PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE BROWNIE AND HE ORDERED BARBAIK TO SPREAD HER BEST TABLE CLOTHS IN THE BARN
BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT EXCLAIMED JEGU WONDERINGLY THAT IS MY AFFAIR PERHAPS I MAY TELL YOU LATER MEANWHILE YOU JUST EAT AND SLEEP AND DON'T WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT ANYTHING
AND IN THE DWELLINGS THAT WERE LEFT WAS NOTHING SAVE WILD BEASTS FOR A YEAR THESE FOUR FED ON THE MEAT THAT MANAWYDDAN AND PRYDERI KILLED OUT HUNTING AND THE HONEY OF THE BEES THAT SUCKED THE MOUNTAIN HEATHER FOR A TIME THEY DESIRED NOTHING MORE
BUT WHEN HE SAW THE BLOOD POURING FROM HIS FACE HE WENT TO A CORNER OF THE COURT AND BEGAN TO CRY WHICH WAS THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL ON HEARING THIS THE KING WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH HIS BACK TO THE ROOM
GREAT SCOTT WE'RE IN FOR IT NOW THOUGHT DOLLY IN SECRET DISMAY WHILE STUFFY GOT THE FIRST BLOW BY TRYING TO SUSTAIN HIMSELF WITH ANOTHER MUG OF BEER THAT WON'T HURT YOU BUT I MUST WARN YOU ABOUT DRINKING OTHER THINGS GEORGE
WHAT ARE YOU AT HERE MISCHIEF ASKED DEMI WITH AN IRVINGESQUE START AS HE FELT RATHER THAN SAW A DISTURBING INFLUENCE IN HIS DAY DREAM GETTING FLOWERS FOR OUR BRIDES
BUT THE LOVING HEART TURNED INSTINCTIVELY TO THE GREAT HELPER IN THIS HOUR OF DESPAIR AND HE HEARD HER FEEBLE CRY IT WAS A SWEET OLD HYMN OFTEN SUNG AT PLUMFIELD AND AS HE LISTENED ALL THE HAPPY PAST CAME BACK SO CLEARLY
AND SHOWED THAT IT SUITED HIM BY SAYING BLANDLY INSTEAD OF SNUBBING HER AS USUAL YOU ARE VERY KIND CHILD SINCE YOU ARE SO WISE COULD YOU GIVE ME A HINT HOW I'D BETTER SPEAK UP AS YOU ELEGANTLY EXPRESS IT OH WELL THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS YOU KNOW
ALL DAY HE TRIED TO CHEER AND COMFORT THEM WHILE HUNGER GNAWED THIRST PARCHED AND GROWING FEAR LAY HEAVY AT HIS HEART HE TOLD STORIES TO THE MEN IMPLORED THEM TO BEAR UP FOR THE HELPLESS WOMEN'S SAKE AND PROMISED REWARDS
FOR HE WAS A PRETTY YOUTH AND FANCIED HIMSELF AN ADONIS EAGER JOSIE EVIDENTLY DID NOT APPRECIATE THE HONOUR HE DID HER FOR WITH A NOD SHE BEGGED THEM BOTH TO COME ALONG AND PLAY TENNIS NOT GO AND GET ALL HOT AND DIRTY WITH THE BOYS
MUCH IMPRESSED BY THAT DIRE THREAT DOLLY HELPED HER FROM HER PERCH WITH DEEP RESPECT AND STUFFY RELIEVED HER OF HER EMPTY JUGS SOLEMNLY VOWING TO ABSTAIN FROM ALL FERMENTED BEVERAGES EXCEPT ROOT BEER AS LONG AS FEEBLE FLESH COULD HOLD OUT
THE POEMS WERE AS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS OF VARIED EXCELLENCE AS THE YOUTHFUL SPEAKERS TRIED TO PUT OLD TRUTHS INTO NEW WORDS AND MADE THEM FORCEFUL BY THE ENTHUSIASM OF THEIR EARNEST FACES AND FRESH VOICES
AND I'LL TIE THEM UP AND PUT THEM IN HER ROOM SHE IS COMING TO DRESS WITH DAISY SO I CAN DO IT NICELY DEMI MUSED A MOMENT WITH HIS EYES ON THE BRIDAL BUSH AND A SMILE CAME OVER HIS FACE SO UNLIKE ANY IT HAD EVER WORN BEFORE THAT JOSIE WAS TOUCHED
MY PEACE WHEN A WORD MAY KEEP YOU FROM TWO OF THE GREAT SINS THAT CURSE THE WORLD AND SEND SO MANY YOUNG MEN TO DESTRUCTION YOU ARE JUST BEGINNING TO FEEL THE ALLUREMENT OF THEM AND SOON IT WILL BE HARD TO TURN AWAY STOP NOW I BEG OF YOU
NOW YOU MAY READ IF YOU LIKE AND THERE THE TALK ENDED BUT TED TOOK GREAT COMFORT IN IT AND LOOKED AS WISE AS AN OWL AFTERWARDS A FEW QUIET WEEKS FOLLOWED DURING WHICH DAN CHAFED AT THE DELAY AND WHEN AT LENGTH WORD CAME THAT HIS CREDENTIALS WERE READY
AND SEPARATED THEM SOME NEVER TO MEET AGAIN TILL THE SEA GIVES UP ITS DEAD THE BOAT WHOSE FORTUNES WE MUST FOLLOW WAS ALONE WHEN DAWN CAME UP SHOWING THESE SURVIVORS ALL THE DANGERS OF THEIR SITUATION
MISSUS JO SHOOK HER HEAD AS IF THE SILVER LINING OF THAT CLOUD WAS HARD TO FIND BUT SHE HAD NO TIME TO CROAK AGAIN FOR JUST THEN MISTER LAURIE CAME IN LOOKING WELL PLEASED AT SOMETHING
EMIL STAYED BY HIM TILL ORDERED AWAY AND RELUCTANTLY OBEYED BUT IT WAS WELL FOR HIM HE WENT
ONE CRY BROKE FROM ALL THOSE EAGER THROATS AND RANG ACROSS THE SEA AS EVERY MAN WAVED HAT OR HANDKERCHIEF AND THE WOMEN STRETCHED IMPLORING HANDS TOWARDS THIS GREAT WHITE ANGEL OF DELIVERANCE COMING DOWN UPON THEM
AND THE OLDER FOLK REJOICED OVER HIS PROSPECTS OF COURSE ALL WANTED TO HEAR HIM PLAY AND WHEN TONGUES TIRED HE GLADLY DID HIS BEST FOR THEM SURPRISING THE MOST CRITICAL BY HIS PROGRESS IN MUSIC EVEN MORE THAN BY THE ENERGY AND SELF POSSESSION
WITH A YEARNING GLANCE TOWARDS THE HOUSE WHENCE NO SUCCOUR APPEARED HOW WOULD ROOT BEER DO ASKED A VOICE BEHIND THEM WHICH MADE DOLLY SPRING TO HIS FEET AND STUFFY ROLL OVER LIKE A STARTLED PORPOISE SITTING ON THE STILE THAT CROSSED THE WALL NEAR BY WAS MISSUS JO
TO BIND HIM BY ANY PROMISE OR EVEN TO PUT INTO WORDS THE LOVE AND HONOUR SHE FELT FOR HIM NO IT WOULD BE MORE GENEROUS TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE ALONE AND SPARE HIM THE PAIN OF HOPE DEFERRED HE WAS YOUNG HE WOULD FORGET
SO TED FOUND ONE RAY OF JOY TO LIGHT HIS GLOOM
AND PUT IT ON AGAIN AT ONCE AS IF GLAD TO GET THE DUTY OVER THE SLENDER BEING WITH THE CRIMSON TIE LIFTED HIS WITH A GRACEFUL BEND AND HELD IT ALOFT WHILE HE ACCOSTED THE ROSY BREATHLESS MAID THUS PERMITTING HER TO SEE HIS RAVEN LOCKS SMOOTHLY PARTED
SHE HAD BEEN PLAYING WITH BESS AND BEATING HER FOR THOUGH MORE GRACEFUL THE PRINCESS WAS LESS ACTIVE THAN HER COUSIN AND CULTIVATED HER ROSES BY QUIETER METHODS OH DEAR YOU ARE TIRED AND EVERY BLESSED BOY IS AT THAT STUPID BASEBALL MATCH
AND BE LIKE THE SELF SACRIFICING HEROINES SHE LOVED TO ACT
AS YOU WANTED US TO IMPROVE YOUR MANNERS ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT YOUNG LADIES IN GOOD SOCIETY DON'T MAKE PERSONAL REMARKS OR DELIVER LECTURES LITTLE GIRLS WHO ARE NOT OUT DO IT AND THINK IT WITTY BUT I ASSURE YOU IT'S NOT GOOD FORM
A TRANQUIL SNORE WAS STUFFY'S SOLE REPLY AND A GENERAL LAUGH RESTORED PEACE FOR THE MOMENT BUT JOSIE LOVED TO HARASS THE LORDS OF CREATION WHO ASSERTED THEMSELVES TOO MUCH AND BIDED HER TIME FOR ANOTHER ATTACK TILL SHE HAD SECURED MORE TENNIS
NOW WAS ALIVE WITH BOATS OF ALL KINDS FROM THE SLENDER WHERRY TO THE TRIM PLEASURE CRAFT GAY WITH CUSHIONS AWNINGS AND FLUTTERING PENNONS EVERYONE ROWED AND THE GIRLS AS WELL AS THE YOUTHS HAD THEIR RACES AND DEVELOPED THEIR MUSCLES IN THE MOST SCIENTIFIC MANNER
EMIL DID HIS BEST BUT MORTAL MAN WAS HELPLESS THERE AND HE COULD ONLY TURN HIS HAGGARD FACE FROM THE PITILESS SKY THAT DROPPED NO RAIN FOR THEIR THIRST TO THE BOUNDLESS SEA WHERE NO SAIL APPEARED TO GLADDEN THEIR LONGING EYES
SHE WOULD GO TO THE RESCUE AND BY A WISE MIXTURE OF FUN AND AUTHORITY FINALLY SUCCEED IN PERSUADING TED THAT HE WAS A THING OF BEAUTY IF NOT A JOY FOR EVER
YOU HOWLING SWELLS OUGHT TO IMPROVE OUR MINDS AND MANNERS FOR WE ARE ONLY POOR COUNTRY GIRLS IN DOWDY GOWNS AND HATS BEGAN THE GAD FLY
BUT AS THAT SOMEWHAT MELODRAMATIC CONCLUSION MIGHT SHOCK MY GENTLE READERS I WILL REFRAIN AND FORESTALL THE USUAL QUESTION HOW DID THEY END BY BRIEFLY STATING THAT ALL THE MARRIAGES TURNED OUT WELL THE BOYS PROSPERED IN THEIR VARIOUS CALLINGS SO DID THE GIRLS
A HALF BLOWN AND A FULL BLOWN ROSE I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH SHE TOOK BUT IT'S A PRETTY WAY AND ALICE KNOWS ABOUT IT BECAUSE SHE WAS THERE WHEN WE READ IT HERE ARE ALL KINDS YOU'VE GOT THE TWO BUDS PICK THE SWEETEST ROSE YOU CAN FIND
AND CHEERING ONE ANOTHER WITH PROPHECIES OF SPEEDY RESCUE SECOND MATE HOFFMANN WAS VERY BRAVE AND HELPFUL THOUGH HIS UNEXPECTED RESPONSIBILITY WEIGHED HEAVILY ON HIS SHOULDERS FOR THE CAPTAIN'S STATE SEEMED DESPERATE
HAVE A GAY OLD TIME AND BE A HOWLING SWELL IF I CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU AND ME THOUGH
AS BEST MAN HE COULD NOT REFUSE THE NEW SUIT FRANZ INSISTED ON ORDERING FOR HIM AND A CHEQUE FROM HOME ABOUT THAT TIME MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A MILLIONAIRE AND A HAPPY ONE FOR THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH KIND LETTERS FULL OF DELIGHT IN HIS SUCCESS
IF YOU WANT TO BE GAY AND EASY OR YOU COULD WRITE A POETICAL POP YOU'VE TRIED IT I DARE SAY BUT SERIOUSLY JO I DO LOVE ALICE AND I THINK SHE KNOWS IT I WANT TO TELL HER SO BUT I LOSE MY HEAD WHEN I TRY
BUT YOU WILL SOON IF YOU KEEP UP THIS SORT OF STUDY AND FORGET TO BE ASHAMED THE SOCIETY OF SUCH WOMEN WILL UNFIT YOU FOR THAT OF GOOD ONES AND LEAD YOU INTO TROUBLE AND SIN AND SHAME OH WHY DON'T THE CITY FATHERS STOP THAT EVIL THING
HIS TASK MIGHT BE A TERRIBLE ONE SO HE CLUTCHED HIS COURAGE WITH BOTH HANDS KEPT UP A MANLY FRONT AND SPOKE SO CHEERILY OF THEIR GOOD CHANCES THAT ALL INSTINCTIVELY TURNED TO HIM FOR GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT
HIS HOME THE OCEAN'S WIDE EXPANSE A CORAL BED HIS GRAVE JUST AS THE LAST NOTES OF THE CLEAR STRONG VOICE DIED AWAY MISSUS HARDY SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED WHAT'S THAT
WORK AND PLAIN FARE ARE WHAT YOU WANT AND I WISH I HAD YOU HERE FOR A FEW MONTHS OUT OF HARM'S WAY I'D BANTING YOU AND FIT YOU TO RUN WITHOUT PUFFING AND GET ON WITHOUT FOUR OR FIVE MEALS A DAY
WITH A NOD OF THANKS TO DOLLY WHO WAS CAREFULLY REMOVING AN INQUISITIVE CATERPILLAR FROM ONE OF HER LITTLE RUSSET SHOES I LIKE A LADY WHO IS ALWAYS POLITE AND DOESN'T SNAP A MAN'S HEAD OFF IF HE HAS A MIND OF HIS OWN DON'T YOU GEORGE ASKED DOLLY WITH HIS BEST SMILE FOR BESS
THINGS LOOKED DARK AND HOPE BEGAN TO FAIL THE WOUNDED MAN WAS DELIRIOUS THE WIFE WORN OUT WITH ANXIETY AND SUSPENSE THE GIRL WEAK FOR WANT OF FOOD HAVING PUT AWAY HALF HER BISCUIT FOR HER MOTHER AND GIVEN HER SHARE OF WATER TO WET HER FATHER'S FEVERISH LIPS
AND MISSUS JO TURNED TO THE OTHER CULPRIT WHO SHOOK IN HIS SHOES AND WISHED HE HADN'T COME ARE YOU STUDYING FRENCH AS INDUSTRIOUSLY AS YOU WERE LAST WINTER NO MA'AM I DON'T CARE FOR IT
JOSIE RETURNED IN TRIUMPH TO THE COURT CASTING HIMSELF PONDEROUSLY UPON THE BENCH WHICH CREAKED UNDER HIS WEIGHT STUFFY
OH I'VE HEARD YOU MEN TALK AND HEARD YOUR FATHERS SAY THEY WISH THEY HADN'T WASTED TIME AND MONEY JUST THAT YOU MIGHT SAY YOU'D BEEN THROUGH COLLEGE AS FOR THE GIRLS YOU'LL BE MUCH BETTER OFF IN ALL WAYS WHEN THEY DO GET IN AND KEEP YOU LAZY THINGS UP TO THE MARK AS WE DO HERE
IT WAS A MOOT POINT WHETHER PRISONERS WERE SO TREATED WITH SUFFICIENT WARRANT IN LAW EMINENT JURISTS HELD THAT THE DISTRICT HAD NO RIGHT TO CONVICT A PERSON UNDER ITS LAWS AND COMMIT THAT PERSON TO CONFINEMENT IN ANOTHER STATE THEY CONTENDED THAT SENTENCE IMPOSED UPON A PERSON FOR UNLAWFUL ACTS IN THE DISTRICT
MASSACHUSETTS MISSUS AGNES H MOREY BROOKLINE MISSUS WILLIAM BERGEN AND MISS CAMILLA WHITCOMB WORCESTER MISS ELLA FINDEISEN LAWRENCE MISS L J C DANIELS BOSTON NEW JERSEY
AND MISS MABEL VERNON OF DELAWARE MISS LAVINIA DOCK OF PENNSYLVANIA MISS MAUD
COME BACK ON FRIDAY I AM NOT YET PREPARED TO TRY THE CASE LOGIC DICTATED THAT EITHER WE HAD A RIGHT TO STAND AT THE GATES WITH OUR BANNERS OR WE DID NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT
USING THEIR WELCOME RELEASE TO CONTINUE THEIR PROTEST THE WOMEN AGAIN MARCHED WITH THEIR BANNERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PICKET AGAIN THEY WERE ARRESTED NO ONE WHO SAW THAT LINE WILL EVER FORGET THE IMPRESSION IT MADE NOT ONLY ON FRIENDS OF THE SUFFRAGISTS
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND INSISTING ON AN IMMEDIATE DECLARATION BY THE PRESIDENT IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT DEMOCRATIC ORATORS DID THEIR UTMOST TO MEET THIS OPPOSITION
THE CHIEF OF POLICE MAJOR PULLMAN WAS DETAILED TO REQUEST US TO STOP PICKETING AND TO TELL US THAT IF WE CONTINUED TO PICKET WE WOULD BE ARRESTED WE HAVE PICKETED FOR SIX MONTHS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE SAID MISS PAUL HAS THE LAW BEEN CHANGED
WHICH MISTER HUGHES WAS ADVOCATING AND WHICH ALONE CAN ENFRANCHISE ALL THE WOMEN OF THE NATION YOU ASKED ME THEN HOW I MET THIS SITUATION AND I TOLD YOU THAT I PROMISED THE WOMEN VOTERS OF THE WEST
MISTER MALONE'S RESIGNATION IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN SEVENTEEN CAME WITH A SUDDEN SHOCK BECAUSE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND SURELY THE ADMINISTRATION THOUGHT HIM QUIETED AND SUBDUED BY THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL APPEAL TO HIM IN JULY
THIS OCCASION OFFERED US THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO EXPOSE THE ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS IN CLAIMING COMPLETE POLITICAL DEMOCRACY WHILE WOMEN WERE STILL DENIED THEIR POLITICAL FREEDOM
ONLY AGILE SCRAMBLING BY EACH COMMITTEE MEMBER TO ASK WITH EAGERNESS AND SOME HEAT
YIELDING TO THE NAGGING OF A CERTAIN GROUP MISTER CANTRILL OF KENTUCKY DEMOCRAT BELIEVED THAT MILLIONS OF CHRISTIAN WOMEN IN THE NATION SHOULD NOT BE DENIED THE RIGHT OF HAVING A COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE TO STUDY THE PROBLEM OF SUFFRAGE
WE INTENDED TO KNOW WHY IF DEMOCRACY WERE SO PRECIOUS AS TO DEMAND THE NATION'S BLOOD AND TREASURE FOR ITS ACHIEVEMENT ABROAD ITS EXECUTION AT HOME WAS SO UNDESIRABLE MEANWHILE
THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS ADJOURNED WITHOUT EVEN REPORT ING THE MEASURE TO THAT BODY FOR A VOTE AND WENT FORTHWITH TO THE COUNTRY TO ASK REELECTION WE ALSO WENT TO THE COUNTRY
WOULD GO TO MISTER HUGHES AS FEW WOMEN PERHAPS THREW THEIR VOTES TO THE MINORITY PARTIES BUT JUST AS THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY'S PROTEST HAD BEEN EFFECTIVE IN SECURING PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION WITHOUT WINNING THE ELECTION
AND REPORTERS NOT TO ENCOURAGE US IN OUR PECULIAR CONDUCT BY PRINTING DEFIES TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EVEN WHEN FLAUNTED ON A PRETTY LITTLE PURPLE AND GOLD BANNER AND EXHORTS THE PUBLIC TO CONTROL ITS THRILLS
JUST AS THE BLUFF OF A DEMOCRATIC CRUSADE MUST BE CALLED SO MUST THE KNIGHT LEADER OF THE CRUSADE BE EXPOSED TO THE CRITICAL EYES OF THE WORLD
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE IN A FEW WORDS ANY ADEQUATE PICTURE OF THE ANGER OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS AT OUR ENTRANCE INTO THE CAMPAIGN SIX WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION THEY WOKE UP TO FIND THE ISSUE OF NATIONAL SUFFRAGE INJECTED INTO A CAMPAIGN
AND WHICH WAS BEING CONTINUED AT THAT MOMENT MISS LUCY BURNS WHO HAD ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE WOMEN HAD MANAGED TO SECRETE SMALL SCRAPS OF PAPER AND A TINY PENCIL AND JOT DOWN BRIEFLY THE DAY BY DAY EVENTS AT THE WORKHOUSE
SO THE WOMAN'S PARTY HOPED ITS PROTEST WOULD BRING RESULTS IN CONGRESS WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO WIN THE ELECTION HISTORY WILL NEVER KNOW IN ROUND NUMBERS HOW MANY WOMEN VOTED AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY AT THIS CRISIS FOR THERE ARE NO RECORDS KEPT FOR MEN AND WOMEN SEPARATELY
THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS CONTINUED TO BLOCK NATIONAL SUFFRAGE IT WOULD NOT PERMIT IT EVEN TO BE REPORTED FROM THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THE PARTY PLATFORM WAS WRITTEN
SHOULD BE EXECUTED IN THE DISTRICT HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND WHO HAD SERVED THEIR SENTENCES IN VIRGINIA HAD BEEN WITHOUT MONEY OR INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO CONTEST THIS DOUBTFUL PROCEDURE IN THE COURTS THE ADMINISTRATION
TO CHOOSE YOU AS AGAINST MISTER HUGHES I WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO GET YOUR ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE UP AND PASS THE SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT YOU WERE PLEASED AND APPROVED OF WHAT I HAD DONE I RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA AND REPEATED THIS PROMISE AND SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED
IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR SOME ONE TO MAKE A PROTEST AND YOU HAVE MADE ONE THAT HAS BEEN HEARD FAR AND WIDE MISSUS CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION WROTE
IF THERE IS ANY SACRIFICE IN THIS UNHAPPY CIRCUMSTANCE IT IS I WHO AM MAKING THE SACRIFICE I WAS SENT TWICE AS YOUR SPOKESMAN IN THE LAST CAMPAIGN TO THE WOMAN SUFFRAGE STATES OF THE WEST YOU HAVE SINCE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY
HOPING TO WIN BACK TO THE FOLD THE WANDERING PROGRESSIVES WHO HAD THUS DEMONSTRATED THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO SUFFRAGE AND SEEING AN OPPORTUNITY TO EMBARRASS THE ADMINISTRATION THE REPUBLICANS BEGAN TO INTEREST THEMSELVES IN ACTION ON THE AMENDMENT
THE PEOPLE WERE EXCITED TO AN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED PITCH OVER THE ISSUE OF PEACE VERSUS WAR IN SPITE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF COMPETING WITH THIS EMOTIONAL ISSUE WHICH MEANT THE IMMEDIATE DISPOSAL OF MILLIONS OF LIVES
FOR THE SUPPORT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTIES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SENT AS ITS REPRESENTATIVES JOHN HAYS HAMMOND AND C S OSBORN FORMERLY GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN THE DEMOCRATS SENT THEIR MOST PERSUASIVE ORATOR
AND BY A VOTE OF SIX TO FIVE DECIDED TO REPORT FAVORABLY ON THE RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR A WOMAN SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE AFTER ALL PENDING WAR MEASURES HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF BEFORE THE MEETING
THEY TOOK ME TO MISTER WHITTAKER'S OFFICE
AND SO THE HEARING PASSED IN SOMETHING OF A VERBAL RIOT BUT WITH NO DOUBT AS TO THE FACT THAT CONGRESSMEN WERE ALARMED BY THE PROSPECT OF WOMEN VOTING AS A PROTEST GROUP THE NEW YEAR FOUND THE SENATE PROMPTLY REPORTING THE MEASURE FAVORABLY AGAIN
OR ANY OTHER OFFICIAL OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR A REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES HE SEEMED TO ACQUIESCE IN THIS VIEW AND REMINDED ME THAT THE WOMEN HAD BEEN UNMOLESTED AT THE WHITE HOUSE GATES FOR OVER FIVE MONTHS ADDING THAT HE HAD EVEN ORDERED THE HEAD USHER TO INVITE THE WOMEN ON COLD DAYS TO COME INTO THE WHITE HOUSE
THE INSTANT RESPONSE WHICH MET THIS APPEAL SURPASSED THE MOST OPTIMISTIC HOPES THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ASSEMBLED IN CHICAGO FOR THIS CONVENTION WHICH BECAME EPOCH MAKING NOT ONLY IN THE SUFFRAGE FIGHT BUT IN THE WHOLE WOMAN MOVEMENT
WHILE THESE WOMEN CITIZENS ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON THE POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH DEMANDS OF THEM SUCH SACRIFICE FOR THIS REASON MANY OF YOUR MOST ARDENT FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS FEEL THAT THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT
AT THE SAME TIME HIS NOW GIGANTIC FIGURE STOOD OBSTINATELY ACROSS THE PATH TO OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE IT WAS OUR DAILY TASK TO KEEP VIVIDLY IN HIS MIND THAT OBJECTIVE IT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPEL DECISIVE ACTION FROM HIM
NOR DID THEY RELISH SPENDING MORE MONEY PUBLISHING MORE LITERATURE IN SHORT ADDING GREATLY TO THE BURDENS OF THEIR CAMPAIGN THE CANDIDATES A LITTLE MORE SUAVE THAN THE PARTY LEADERS PROVED MOST ELOQUENTLY
AND AS ANOTHER MONTH OF PICKETING DREW TO AN END THE ADMINISTRATION VENTURED TO TRY OTHER WAYS TO STOP IT AND WITH IT THE CONSEQUENT EMBARRASSMENT THEIR METHODS BECAME PHYSICALLY MORE BRUTAL AND POLITICALLY MORE STUPID THEIR CONDUCT
TWENTY MILLION AMERI CAN WOMEN ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE PRESI DENT WILSON IS THE CHIEF OPPONENT OF THEIR NA TIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT HELP US MAKE THIS NATION REALLY FREE TELL OUR GOVERNMENT IT MUST LIBERATE ITS PEOPLE BEFORE IT CAN CLAIM FREE RUSSIA AS AN ALLY
MISTER PRESIDENT IF YOU SINCERELY DESIRE TO FORWARD THE INTERESTS OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHY DO YOU OPPOSE THE NATIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT OF WOMEN
MOST OF THE DELEGATES ASSEMBLED HAD BEEN APPROACHED EITHER BEFORE GOING TO WASHINGTON OR UPON ARRIVING AND URGED TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO PERSUADE THE ORGANIZATION TO ABANDON ITS WORK FOR THE FREEDOM OF WOMEN AND TURN ITS ACTIVITIES INTO WAR CHANNELS
THE PRESIDENT HASTENED TO NEW JERSEY TO CAST HIS VOTE FOR SUFFRAGE IN A STATE REFERENDUM
THE PRESIDENT'S PARDON IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIM OF THE GRAVE INJUSTICE THAT HAS BEEN DONE THIS HE NEVER DENIED UNDER THIS PUBLISHED INTERPRETATION OF HIS PARDON THE WOMEN AT OCCOQUAN ACCEPTED THE PARDON
GOVERNMENTS DERIVE THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE THIRTEEN SILENT SENTINELS WITH BANNERS BEARING THE SAME WORDS ARE ARRESTED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY DROLL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SO TRAGIC
NEWS HAD SPREAD THROUGH THE CITY THAT THE PICKETS WERE TO BE ARRESTED A MODERATELY LARGE CROWD HAD GATHERED TO SEE THE FUN ONE HAS ONLY TO COME INTO CONFLICT WITH PREVAILING AUTHORITY WHETHER RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY TO FIND FRIENDLY HOSTS VANISHING WITH LIGHTNING SPEED
FILED THE FAVORABLE REPORT WHICH HAD BEEN LYING WITH HIS COMMITTEE SINCE MAY FIFTEENTH EXACTLY SIX MONTHS THE REPORT WHICH HE HAD SO LONG DELAYED BECAUSE HE WANTED HE SAID TO MAKE IT A PARTICULARLY BRILLIANT AND ELABORATE ONE
ON THE QUESTION OF NATIONAL SUFFRAGE AND WOULD CONFER WITH HIS PARTY COLLEAGUES THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEES HEARD THE CASE OF THE ENVOYS THEY WERE GIVEN A HEARING BEFORE THE SENATE SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE AND BEFORE THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
I SHALL NOT STAY HERE TO BE POINTED AT I WILL GO BACK HOME IF HE FOLLOWS ME THEN I SHALL CHOOSE TO FORGET ALL ABOUT HIS RANK IF HE LOVES ME WELL ENOUGH TO SHOW THAT HE IS IN EARNEST I SHALL NOT DISAPPOINT HIM FOR THE SAKE OF PLEASING HIS FATHER
I HAVE PROMISED TO GO UP TO TOWN WITH TREGEAR FOR A DAY OR TWO AFTER THAT I WILL STICK TO MY PURPOSE OF GOING TO MATCHING AGAIN I WILL BE THERE ABOUT THE TWENTY SECOND AND WILL THEN STAY OVER CHRISTMAS
I AM SORRY FOR IT I CAN SAY NOTHING ELSE YOU AIN'T SO SORRY FOR IT AS I AM OH NO YOU CAN NEVER BE THAT MY LORD AFTER ALL WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO YOU
TRUSTING MUCH TO A BELIEF THAT WHEN ONCE HE WAS MARRIED HIS FATHER WOULD COME ROUND HIS FATHER ALWAYS DID COME ROUND BUT THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE IMPOSSIBLE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD ASK HIS FATHER'S CONSENT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
I AM IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND LORD SILVERBRIDGE THAT IT WOULD BE A SATISFACTION TO TELL IT ALL EVEN AGAINST MYSELF I CAN'T PREVENT YOU THEN TIFTO GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AS THOUGH HE WERE GOING
THAT SHE MUST MARRY HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE AS AN UNMARRIED GIRL SHE WAS A BURDEN DURING THE DINNER SHE WAS VERY GAY TO BE GAY WAS THE HABIT WE MAY ALMOST SAY THE WORK OF HER LIFE IT SO CHANCED THAT SHE SAT BETWEEN SIR TIMOTHY BEESWAX
PERHAPS YOU MAY CALL HIM A GENTLEMAN BUT THERE ARE MANY SUCH WITH WHOM YOUR FATHER WOULD NOT WISH TO BE SO CLOSELY CONNECTED AS YOU PROPOSE BUT I MAY HAVE YOUR SANCTION MISTER BONCASSEN AGAIN TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND WALKED ALONG THOUGHTFULLY
I WOULD RATHER YOU WROTE THE LETTER SAID LADY MARY BUT PRAY TELL HIM THAT ALL ALONG I HAVE MEANT HIM TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT TILL LADY CANTRIP SEATED HERSELF AT HER WRITING TABLE
AS YOU AND I MY DEAR ARE FRIENDS I THINK THAT ANY CARRYING OF A MESSAGE TO MARY WOULD BE BREAKING CONFIDENCE I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO MARY ABOUT MISTER TREGEAR THEN HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT
WHEN IT IS SETTLED LET ME KNOW AT ONCE BUT IF IT SHOULD NEVER BE SETTLED I WILL ASK NO QUESTIONS BUT IF IT BE SETTLED TELL ME THEN IN PALACE YARD HE WAS TURNING TO GO
LOOK HERE MAJOR TIFTO YOU HAVE COME HERE TO CONFESS THAT YOU HAVE DONE ME A GREAT INJURY YES I HAVE AND YOU SAY YOU ARE SORRY FOR IT INDEED I AM AND I HAVE FORGIVEN YOU
IF YOU ARE COMING DOWN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN I WILL WALK WITH YOU SILVERBRIDGE OF COURSE HAD TO GO DOWN TO THE HOUSE AGAIN AND THEY STARTED TOGETHER
WE WAS VERY MUCH TOGETHER AT ONE TIME MY LORD YES MAJOR TIFTO WE WERE OF COURSE I WAS A VILLAIN BUT IT WAS ONLY ONCE AND YOUR LORDSHIP WAS SO ROUGH TO ME I AM NOT SAYING BUT WHAT I WAS A VILLAIN
THIS SHE SAID IN ANSWER TO A THREAT WHICH HE HAD MADE OFTEN BEFORE AND NOW REPEATED OF GETTING RID ALTOGETHER OF THE HOUSE IN BELGRAVE SQUARE WHENEVER HE MADE THIS THREAT HE DID NOT SCRUPLE TO TELL HER THAT THE HOUSE HAD TO BE KEPT UP SOLELY FOR HER WELFARE
WOULD IT BE NO DISGRACE THAT SHE SHOULD BE KNOWN HERE IN ENGLAND TO BE YOUR WIFE AND THAT NONE OF THOSE OF YOUR RANK OF WHAT WOULD THEN BE HER OWN RANK SHOULD WELCOME HER INTO HER NEW WORLD THAT WOULD BE OUT OF THE QUESTION
I HAVE NO IDEA OF GOING ON SUCH A JOURNEY EXCEPT ON TERMS OF EQUALITY JUST STEP AND STEP ALIKE THEN SHE TOOK HOLD OF HIS ARM AND PUT OUT ONE FOOT ARE YOU READY I AM VERY WILLING
IF HE WAS IN EARNEST HE WILL COME AGAIN HE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST THEN HE WILL COME AGAIN I DON'T THINK HE WILL SAID LADY MABEL I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS TOO OLD FOR HIM AND I TRIED TO LAUGH HIM OUT OF IT
I GOT TO THINK THAT YOUR LORDSHIP WAS UPSETTING I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR LORDSHIP REMEMBERS BUT YOU DID PUT ME DOWN ONCE OR TWICE RATHER UNCOMMON I HOPE I WAS NOT UNJUST I DON'T SAY YOU WAS MY LORD
FRANK TREGEAR HAS TAKEN TO GAMBLING LIKE THE REST OF THEM WHO SAYS SO
IT WAS BEASTLY WORK THE DUKE MADE ANOTHER MEMORANDUM TO INSTRUCT HIS SON THAT NO GENTLEMAN ABOVE THE AGE OF A SCHOOLBOY SHOULD ALLOW HIMSELF TO USE SUCH A WORD IN SUCH A SENSE
NOW I WANT YOU TO TELL PAPA ALL ABOUT IT LADY CANTRIP BEGAN TO THINK THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EVIL DAY FOR HER WHEN SHE HAD AGREED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIS VERY DETERMINED YOUNG LADY BUT SHE CONSENTED AT ONCE TO WRITE TO THE DUKE
I HOPE HE HASN'T I KNOW I HAVE I WISH SOMEONE WOULD STICK UP FOR ME AND SAY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT IS NOT MISTER TREGEAR'S WAY OF LIVING I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT LORD SILVERBRIDGE OR PERCIVAL SHOULD LOSE MONEY OR ME OR YOU IF YOU LIKE TO SAY SO OR TIFTO
IT IS THE ONE PLACE YOU DO LIKE SIR HOWEVER WE CAN MANAGE ALL THAT CARLTON TERRACE I DO NOT PARTICULARLY LIKE BUT IT IS A GOOD HOUSE
THIS IS WHERE THE OLD PALLISERS USED TO BE BURIED HE SAID OH INDEED AND MARRIED I SUPPOSE I DARE SAY THEY HAD A PRIEST OF THEIR OWN NO DOUBT WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN CONVENIENT
I WANT TO MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER SAID SILVERBRIDGE ISABEL HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS DOWNRIGHT AND IN SUCH A MATTER HE HAD HARDLY AS YET LEARNED HOW TO EXPRESS HIMSELF WITH THOSE PARAPHRASES IN WHICH THE WORLD DELIGHTS
SHE COULD SEE HIM MARRY AND SMILE AND PERHAPS EVEN LIKE HIS WIFE AND WHILE HE WAS DOING SO SHE COULD ALSO MARRY AND RESOLVE THAT THE HUSBAND WHOM SHE TOOK SHOULD BE MADE TO THINK THAT HE HAD A LOVING WIFE BUT WERE FRANK TO DIE
NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID ABOUT THE MAN BUT SILVERBRIDGE WAS UNEASY AND SILENT WHEN HIS CIGAR WAS FINISHED HE GOT UP SAYING THAT HE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE HOUSE AS HE LEFT THE CLUB HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AS THOUGH EXPECTING TO SEE HIS OLD FRIEND
I DARE SAY NOT I DARE SAY NOT SAID THE DUKE GATHERUM IS ALWAYS THOUGHT TO BE DULL
I DO NOT DENY THAT HE IS ENTITLED TO BE TREATED WELL BUT SO ALSO IS YOUR GROOM LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT HIM AND SO IT IS TO BE MABEL GREX I DID NOT SAY SO SIR
BUT STILL IT SEEMED HARD TO HIM THAT THIS INTENTION OF MARRIAGE SHOULD STAND IN HIS WAY OF HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH MISS BONCASSEN FOR A FEW WEEKS NO DOUBT THERE WERE OBJECTIONS TO MARRIAGE IT CLIPPED A FELLOW'S WINGS BUT THEN IF HE WERE MARRIED
IT MEANT COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE IN MONEY MATTERS THEN HIS MIND RAN AWAY TO A REVIEW OF HIS FATHER'S AFFAIRS IT WAS A GENUINE TROUBLE TO HIM THAT HIS FATHER SHOULD BE SO UNHAPPY OF ALL THE GRIEFS WHICH WEIGHED UPON THE DUKE'S MIND
IT IS A PITY BUT IT CANNOT BE HELPED I WILL HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO DO WITH IT OF COURSE I CANNOT BIND YOU BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU MY WISHES THE POOR WRETCH WAS SILENT BUT STILL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE DID NOT WISH TO GO QUITE YET
NEVER I MIGHT HAVE DONE SO HAD I NOT SEEN YOU I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO IF SHE HAD BEEN WILLING BUT NOW I NEVER CAN NEVER NEVER HER HAND HAD DROPPED FROM HIS ARM
WHOSE ASSISTANCE AT SUCH PERIODS HAD LONG BEEN IN REQUISITION HE KNEW VERY WELL HOW THE SEAT HAD BEEN SECURED TEN SHILLINGS A HEAD WOULD HAVE SENT THREE HUNDRED TRUE LIBERALS TO THE BALLOT BOXES
HE DID NOT THINK THAT HE WOULD MUCH OBJECT TO MAKE THE CHANGE THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING CERTAIN THAT HE MUST EXPLAIN HIS CONDITION TO MISS BONCASSEN BEFORE SHE WENT HE FOUND NO DIFFICULTY NOW IN GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY
SHOULD DISSIPATE THEIR FORTUNES AND THEIR REPUTATIONS BY EVERY KIND OF EXTRAVAGANCE HER FATHER HAD DONE SO AND SHE HAD NEVER EVEN VENTURED TO HOPE THAT HER BROTHER WOULD NOT FOLLOW HER FATHER'S EXAMPLE
THERE IS NO HUMAN BEING ALIVE MAJOR TIFTO WHOSE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE COULD BE A MATTER OF MORE INDIFFERENCE TO ME
THAT EVENING BEFORE HE WENT TO BED LORD SILVERBRIDGE WROTE TO HIS FATHER AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AT POLPENNO POLWENNING FIFTEENTH DECEMBER MY DEAR FATHER
HIS SISTER WAS AT MATCHING WITH A HOUSEFUL OF OTHER PALLISERS AND HIS FATHER WAS AGAIN DEEP IN POLITICS OF COURSE HE WAS MUCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BUT THAT ALSO WAS STUPID INDEED EVERYTHING WOULD BE STUPID TILL ISABEL CAME BACK
BUT WHEN HE SAW THEM TOGETHER HE CONCLUDED THAT MATTERS WERE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT WAS HOWEVER AN OPINION WHICH HE HAD ALL TO HIMSELF DURING THE THREE OR FOUR DAYS WHICH FOLLOWED THE SCENE IN THE BILLIARD ROOM
YOU TURNED ME OUT THAT IS TRUE MAJOR TIFTO YOU WAS VERY ROUGH THEN WASN'T YOU ROUGH A MAN'S BEDROOM IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE
I WILL DO NOTHING THAT I AM ASHAMED TO TELL EVERYBODY HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY I CANNOT HELP IT HE SHOULD NOT TREAT ME AS HE IS DOING MISTER TREGEAR IS A GENTLEMAN WHY DID HE LET HIM COME WHY DID YOU BRING HIM
AND THINKING IT TO BE A GOOD LETTER SHE DETERMINED TO SHOW IT TO THE DUKE MISTER TREGEAR HAS GOT IN AT POLPENNO SHE SAID ON THE DAY ON WHICH SHE AND THE DUKE HAD RECEIVED THEIR LETTERS SO I HEAR FROM SILVERBRIDGE
TO THIS NEITHER MISTER NOR MISSUS BONCASSEN WAS ABLE TO MAKE ANY EFFICIENT ANSWER MISSUS BONCASSEN DEAR GOOD WOMAN COULD SEE NO REASON WHY TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LOVED EACH OTHER SHOULD NOT BE MARRIED AT ONCE
WAS HE MAD I HESITATED TO ADOPT THAT CONCLUSION
BUT YOU MEAN TO TRY YES I MEAN TO TRY HE ANSWERED ME WITH LITTLE OF THE ENERGY WHICH GENERALLY DISTINGUISHED HIM PERHAPS HE WAS FATIGUED OR PERHAPS HE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK OF I OFFERED A SUGGESTION WHEN WE ARE
POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RIVER SIDE VILLAGE FATHER ISN'T AS QUICK AS HE USED TO BE HE'S OFTEN LATE OVER HIS WORK NOW WAS THERE NO ONE TO GIVE GILES TOLLER THE HELP THAT HE MUST NEED AT HIS AGE
TIME HAS PASSED SINCE I FIRST READ IT AND CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE INTERVAL WHICH LEAVE ME FREE TO EXERCISE MY OWN DISCRETION AND TO LET THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY SPEAK FOR ITSELF IF I AM ASKED WHAT IMPRESSION OF THE WRITER THOSE EXTRAORDINARY PAGES PRODUCED ON ME
YOU SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN MISS CRISTEL HIS ANSWER RAISED HIM A STEP HIGHER IN MY ESTIMATION HOW CAN I HELP IT SIR AN ODD MAN WITH A PERSONAL APPEARANCE THAT MIGHT EXCITE A PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM IN SOME MINDS
IN JUSTICE TO THE GIRL I FELT THAT I OUGHT TO SET HIM RIGHT SO FAR TAKING UP THE PENCIL AGAIN I TOLD THIS STRANGE MAN THAT I HAD JUST RETURNED TO ENGLAND AFTER AN ABSENCE OF MANY YEARS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT I HAD KNOWN CRISTEL WHEN WE WERE BOTH CHILDREN
IN THAT SHORT TIME I TOLD HER THAT HE HAD BEEN FOUND IN MY GARDEN LOOKING AT THE FLOWERS AS HE HAD DONE NO HARM I SAID
AND THE SIGNS OF MASCULINE RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY HIS MOUTH AND CHIN ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST PERSON AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION WAS CRISTEL HE BOWED SMILED POSSESSED HIMSELF ABRUPTLY OF HER HAND AND KISSED IT
NOT MINE I LIVE HERE
THE POOR GIRL AS I WAS STILL INCLINED TO FEAR MIGHT HAVE SERIOUS REASON TO REGRET THAT HE HAD EVER ENTERED HER FATHER'S COTTAGE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE MY STEPMOTHER AND I MET AGAIN MISSUS ROYLAKE IN AN EXQUISITE MORNING DRESS WITH HER SMILE IN PERFECT ORDER
YOU WILL ASK ME WHO THE PERSON IS
IF I HAVE MISBEHAVED MYSELF I DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING OR DOING I POINTED TO THE NEW SIDE OF THE COTTAGE BEHIND US IS THE CAUSE THERE I ASKED NO NO INDEED
I THANKED THE LITTLE MILL GIRL AND GAVE HER A KISS DID I FEEL THE CHILD'S BREATH IN MY DAY DREAM STILL FLUTTERING ON MY CHEEK WAS I CONSCIOUS OF HER TOUCH I STARTED TREMBLED RETURNED RELUCTANTLY TO MY PRESENT SELF
THERE WAS AN HYSTERICAL DEFIANCE IN HER MANNER ARE YOU EXCITED ARE YOU ANGRY ARE YOU TRYING TO STARTLE ME BY ACTING A PART I URGED THOSE QUESTIONS ON HER ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND I WAS LOUDLY AND CONFIDENTLY ANSWERED
I FEEL AT A LOSS HOW TO REPLY NOT ONE IMPRESSION BUT MANY IMPRESSIONS TROUBLED AND CONFUSED MY MIND CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE CONFESSION INCLINED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE WRITER WAS MAD BUT I ALTERED MY OPINION AT THE NEXT LEAF
SHE STUDIED MY FACE WITH A MENTAL EFFORT TO REMEMBER ME WHICH GATHERED HER PRETTY EYEBROWS TOGETHER QUAINTLY IN A FROWN THERE'S SOMETHING IN HIS EYES SHE REMARKED NOT SPEAKING TO ME BUT TO HERSELF WHICH DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE STRANGE
BUT I THOUGHT CRISTEL SEEMED TO BE ACTUALLY ALARMED BY MY PROPOSAL WE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE RIVER BANK ON EVERY OCCASION WHEN WE APPROACHED THE COTTAGE I DETECTED HER IN STEALING A LOOK AT THE UGLY MODERN PART OF IT THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE THIS TIME
GLOODY SETTLES THE ACCOUNT A NIGHT OF FEVER A NIGHT WHEN I DID SLUMBER FOR A FEW MINUTES OF HORRID DREAMS THIS WAS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
OF COURSE THAT BOLD GIRL CONTRIVED TO ATTRACT YOUR NOTICE I REPLIED THAT I HAD MET WITH THE BOLD GIRL PURELY BY ACCIDENT ON HER SIDE AS WELL AS ON MINE AND THEN I STARTED A NEW TOPIC
PAUSING TO LISTEN I HEARD NEXT THE WORKING OF OARS IN THEIR ROWLOCKS AFTER ANOTHER INTERVAL A BOAT APPEARED TURNING A PROJECTION IN THE BANK AND ROWED BY A WOMAN PULLING STEADILY AGAINST THE STREAM AS THE BOAT APPROACHED ME IN THE MOONLIGHT
TO THE SOFT PROFUSION OF HIS REDDISH BROWN HAIR TO HIS FINELY SHAPED SENSITIVE LIPS BUT FOR TWO MARKED PECULIARITIES IN HIM WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOWN ME TO BE WRONG THAT IS TO SAY THE EXPRESSION OF POWER ABOUT HIS HEAD
I WAS OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY IGNORANCE MISSUS ROYLAKE WAS SHOCKED AT ANY RATE SHE RESUMED YOU HAVE HEARD OF THEIR FATHER LORD UPPERCLIFF I MADE ANOTHER SHAMEFUL CONFESSION
PERFECTLY CHARMING I WAS ANGRY BY THIS TIME YOU HAVE EXACTLY DESCRIBED HER I SAID MISSUS ROYLAKE BEGAN TO GET ANGRY ON HER SIDE SURELY A LITTLE COARSE AND VULGAR SHE SUGGESTED REVERTING TO POOR CRISTEL
HE POINTED TO THE GRANDLY DARKENING VIEW THE TWO MEN WHO COULD HAVE PAINTED THE MYSTERY OF THOSE GROWING SHADOWS AND FADING LIGHTS LIE IN THE GRAVES OF REMBRANDT AND TURNER SHALL WE GO TO TEA ON OUR WAY TO HIS ROOM WE STOPPED AT THE MILLER'S DOOR
HE LED ME TO THE DOOR OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ROOM AND STOOD CLOSE BY WHEN I KNOCKED SOFTLY AND BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD COME OUT THE TONE OF THE POOR GIRL'S VOICE ANSWERING FORGIVE ME SIR I CAN'T DO IT CONVICTED THE SHE SOCIALIST AS I THOUGHT
YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME I ANSWERED SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE I SAW YOU LAST WHAT IS IT NOTHING I ADVANCED A STEP AND DREW HER CLOSER TO ME A DARK FLUSH DISCOLORED HER FACE AN OVERPOWERING BRILLIANCY FLASHED FROM HER EYES
WHEN I ADD THAT THIS DISCOVERY DID DECIDEDLY OPERATE AS A RELIEF TO MY MIND THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED ON ME BY THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER IS STATED WITHOUT EXAGGERATION AND WITHOUT RESERVE GOOD NIGHT SHE REPEATED FOR THE LAST TIME
I TOLD HER THAT I HAD BEEN ANNOYED AND OFFERED NO OTHER EXPLANATION WONDERFUL TO RELATE SHE SHOWED NO CURIOSITY AND NO SURPRISE MORE WONDERFUL STILL AT EVERY FAIR OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED SHE KEPT OUT OF MY WAY
THE CUR HAD BETRAYED HIMSELF IT WAS A PALTRY VENGEANCE I OWN TO GRATIFY A MALICIOUS PLEASURE AS I DID NOW IN THINKING OF HIM AND SPEAKING OF HIM BY THE DEGRADING NAME WHICH HIS MORBID HUMILITY HAD SUGGESTED
I RAN THE RISK OF OFFENDING HER BY BLUNTLY EXPRESSING THE THOUGHT WHICH WAS THEN IN MY MIND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU ARE CRISTEL TOLLER I SAID THE QUESTION SEEMED TO AMUSE HER WHY SHOULDN'T I BE CRISTEL TOLLER SHE ASKED
MY STEPMOTHER WAS HER CHARMING SELF AGAIN THE MOMENT MY QUESTION HAD PASSED MY LIPS SOCIETY PROVIDED IT WAS NOT SOCIETY AT THE MILL WAS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE AS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION YOUR ABSENCE WAS THE ONLY DRAWBACK SHE ANSWERED
SHE SMILED AND KISSED HER HAND AND FLUTTERED OUT OF THE ROOM CHARMING PERFECTLY CHARMING AND YET I WAS UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO WISH MYSELF BACK IN GERMANY AGAIN I LIT MY CIGAR BUT NOT ON THE TERRACE
YOU WANT TO SMOKE AFTER BREAKFAST WELL I WON'T BE IN YOUR WAY GO OUT ON THE TERRACE YOUR POOR FATHER ALWAYS TOOK HIS CIGAR ON THE TERRACE THEY SAY SMOKING LEADS TO MEDITATION I LEAVE YOU TO MEDITATE ON LADY LENA DON'T FORGET
I'M DISMISSED FROM MY MASTER'S SERVICE THAT'S ALL IT WAS PLAINLY NOT ALL RELIEVED EVEN BY THAT GUARDED REPLY I POINTED TO A CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I MEAN WELL BY YOU I ASKED
THE SOONER I RETURNED IT TO THE WRITER OF THE CONFESSION THE SOONER I TOLD HIM PLAINLY THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH I HAD ARRIVED THE MORE AT EASE MY MIND WOULD BE THE SLUGGISH RIVER LOOKED MUDDIER THAN EVER THE NEW COTTAGE LOOKED UGLIER THAN EVER
AND SHOULD REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCE WITH PLEASURE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE ILL CRISTEL WAS ALL I COULD FIND TO SAY UNDER THE DOUBLE DISADVANTAGE OF SPEAKING THROUGH A DOOR AND HAVING A FATHER LISTENING AT MY SIDE OH NO MISTER GERARD NOT ILL
ON THE RIVER MARGIN OF THE WOOD I WAS CONFRONTED BY A WILD GLEAM OF BEAUTY IN THE FAMILIAR VIEW FOR WHICH PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE HAD NOT PREPARED ME AM I WRONG IN BELIEVING THAT ALL SCENERY NO MATTER HOW MAGNIFICENT OR HOW HOMELY IT MAY BE
BUT HIS THREATENING ME IN THIS MANNER WAS SO ABSURD THAT I GAVE WAY TO THE IMPRESSION OF THE MOMENT AND LAUGHED HE STEPPED UP TO ME WITH SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF DEMONIACAL RAGE AND HATRED IN HIS FACE THAT HE BECAME ABSOLUTELY UGLY IN AN INSTANT I AMUSE YOU DO I HE SAID YOU DON'T KNOW THE MAN YOU'RE TRIFLING WITH
I WROTE MY REPLY THE PLACE MAKES ME SORRY FOR YOU HE SHOOK HIS HEAD YOUR SYMPATHY IS THROWN AWAY ON ME A MAN WHO HAS LOST HIS SOCIAL RELATIONS WITH HIS FELLOW CREATURES DOESN'T CARE HOW HE LODGES OR WHERE HE LIVES WHEN HE HAS FOUND SOLITUDE HE HAS FOUND ALL HE WANTS FOR THE REST OF HIS DAYS
WHICH REMINDED ME AGAIN OF THE VILLAGE SCHOOL THANK YOU YOUNG MAN SHE SAID SMARTLY I WONDER WHO YOU ARE TRY IF YOU CAN RECOLLECT ME I SUGGESTED MAY I TAKE A LONG LOOK AT YOU AS LONG AS YOU LIKE
I MUST TELL YOU THAT LADY RACHEL IS THE ELDEST SHE IS MARRIED TO THE HONORABLE CAPTAIN MILLBAY OF THE NAVY NOW AWAY IN HIS SHIP A PERSON OF EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH OF MIND I DON'T MEAN THE CAPTAIN I MEAN LADY RACHEL
THE MAGISTRATE WOULD PUT QUESTIONS TO ME WOULDN'T HE SIR VERY GOOD YOU PUT QUESTIONS TO ME AND I'LL ANSWER THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
I SLEPT BADLY THE EVENTS THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE MY ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND HAD EXCITED ME I SUPPOSE NOW AND THEN IN THE WAKEFUL HOURS OF THE NIGHT I THOUGHT OF CRISTEL WITH SOME ANXIETY
MY LOYALTY TOWARDS THE AFFLICTED MAN WHOSE FRIENDLY ADVANCES I HAD SEEN GOOD REASON TO RETURN WAS IN NO SENSE SHAKEN HIS UNDESERVED MISFORTUNES HIS MANLY APPEAL TO ME AT THE SPRING
PEOPLE WHO CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA AND TALK ABOUT IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CRAWL ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MOTHER ISN'T SHE WORTH KNOWING I HOPE SHE SENT ME HER LOVE AND NEW YORK HARBOUR
A SUDDEN BREATHLESS HUSH FELL UPON THE AUDIENCE EACH SYLLABLE PENETRATED THE SILENCE BORNE ON A TONE SO TENDER AND SO AMAZINGLY SWEET THAT CASUAL HEARTS STOOD STILL AND MARVELLED AT THEIR OWN EMOTION
WITH OLD LACE AT HER BOSOM AND ONE STRING OF PEARLS ROUND HER NECK WHEN SHE APPEARED THE AUDIENCE GAZED AT HER AND APPLAUDED DOUBTFULLY VELMA'S NAME ON THE PROGRAMME HAD RAISED GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND HERE WAS MISS CHAMPION WHO CERTAINLY PLAYED VERY NICELY
BUT OF A DEEPLY MOVED MAN AND HIS EMOTION WAS OF NO ORDINARY KIND THAT GARTH DALMAIN SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO MOVED AS TO FORGET EVEN MOMENTARILY
AND IF YOU DO NOT KNOW IT NO GROTESQUE SPELLING ON MY PART COULD CONVEY TO YOUR MIND ANY BUT A CARICATURED VERSION OF THE PRETTY SCOTCH ACCENT WITH WHICH MARGERY SAYS STIR THE PORRIDGE NURSE GRAY
HE CAUGHT HER BY THE SHOULDERS AND TURNED HER ROUND GO BACK HE SAID AND THE OVERMASTERING NEED QUIVERING IN HIS VOICE DREW JANE'S EYES TO HIS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT GO BACK AT ONCE AND SING IT ALL OVER AGAIN NOTE FOR NOTE WORD FOR WORD
ARE PROVED PERFECTLY RIGHT IN YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF THE SENTIMENT OF THE CASE HE SAYS HER PITY WOULD BE THE LAST STRAW ON HIS ALREADY HEAVY CROSS AND THE EXPRESSION IS AN APT ONE HER PITY FOR HIM BEING INDEED A THING OF STRAW
MY LETTER WAS FROM OH DON'T TELL ME CRIED GARTH QUICKLY PUTTING OUT HIS HAND IN PROTEST I HAD NO IDEA OF SEEMING CURIOUS AS TO YOUR PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE MISS GRAY
AND NURSE ROSEMARY BEGAN DEAR DAL WHAT CAN I WRITE IF I WERE WITH YOU THERE WOULD BE SO MUCH I COULD SAY BUT WRITING IS SO DIFFICULT SO IMPOSSIBLE
I WILL DO MY BEST ONLY ALAS I AM NOT MOSES AND DO NOT POSSESS HIS WONDER WORKING ROD MOREOVER LATEST INVESTIGATIONS HAVE PROVED THAT THE ISRAELITES COULD NOT HAVE CROSSED AT THE PLACE YOU MENTION
THE ONLY PITY SHE FEELS IS PITY FOR HERSELF THUS HOPELESSLY CAUGHT IN THE MESHES OF HER OWN MISTAKE BUT HOW TO MAKE HIM REALISE THIS IS THE PUZZLE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW THE ISRAELITES WERE SHUT IN BETWEEN MIGDOL AND THE SEA
BUT FURTHER NORTH AT THE BITTER LAKES A MERE MATTER OF DETAIL IN NO WAY AFFECTING THE EXTREME APPOSITENESS OF YOUR ILLUSTRATION RATHER ADDING TO IT FOR I FEAR THERE ARE BITTER WATERS AHEAD OF YOU MY POOR GIRL STILL I AM HOPEFUL
SO I SENT FOR SIMPSON AND MARGERY TO THE DINING ROOM THAT EVENING WHEN THE MASTER WAS SAFELY OUT OF EAR SHOT AND TOLD THEM THAT FOR REASONS WHICH I COULD NOT FULLY EXPLAIN A VERY INCORRECT DESCRIPTION OF MY APPEARANCE HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM
SHE EVEN ADDED HER OWN COMMENTARY AND A VERY GOOD THING TOO I AM THINKING FOR MASTER GARTH POOR LADDIE WAS ALWAYS SO SET UPON HAVING BEAUTY ABOUT HIM MASTER GARTHIE I WOULD SAY TO HIM WHEN HE HAD FRIENDS COMING
HIS FACE WAS JUST AS WHITE AS BEFORE BUT HIS EYES HAD LOST THAT TERRIBLE LOOK OF UNSHED TEARS WHICH HAD SENT HER BACK AT HIS BIDDING WITHOUT A WORD OF QUESTION OR REMONSTRANCE A WONDERFUL LIGHT NOW SHONE IN THEM A LIGHT OF ADORATION WHICH TOUCHED JANE'S HEART
I SHOULD HAVE LIKED THAT WE THREE SHOULD HAVE TALKED TOGETHER BUT NO WONDER YOU WANT A TIME OFF SHALL YOU BE GOING FAR NO I HAVE FRIENDS NEAR BY AND NOW DO YOU WISH TO ATTEND TO YOUR LETTERS YES SAID GARTH REACHING OUT HIS HAND
LEFT THE PLATFORM BY THE SIDE STAIRCASE BUT THERE BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE SEMI DARKNESS OF SCREENS AND CURTAINS A FRESH SURPRISE AWAITED JANE MORE STARTLING THAN THE ENTHUSIASTIC TUMULT OF HER AUDIENCE
AND WRITE ASKING YOU TO COME AND SEE ME WHEN GENERAL LORAINE TURNED UP WITH AN ENGLISH PAPER AND A LETTER FROM MYRA AND I HEARD WOULD YOU HAVE COME GARTH AND NOW MY FRIEND AS YOU CANNOT COME TO ME
AND HASTILY SCANNED ITS PAGES AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PLATFORM IN THE WAKE OF THE CAPABLE PORTER WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER RUGS AND HAND BAGGAGE IN THE PERSONAL COLUMN SHE FOUND THE VERY PARAGRAPH SHE SOUGHT
STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE STOOD GARTH DALMAIN HIS FACE WAS ABSOLUTELY COLOURLESS AND HIS EYES SHONE OUT FROM IT LIKE BURNING STARS HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS UNTIL SHE STEPPED FROM THE LAST STAIR AND STOOD CLOSE TO HIM THEN WITH A SUDDEN MOVEMENT
JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
NO SAID NURSE ROSEMARY NOT YET
EMBLEM OF THE UNDENIABLE PURITY OF ENGLAND THE STAINLESS HONOUR AND INTEGRITY OF HER THRONE HER CHURCH HER PARLIAMENT HER COURTS OF JUSTICE AND HER DEALINGS AT HOME AND ABROAD WHETHER WITH FRIEND OR FOE
AND THOSE WHO FELT DEEPLY ALREADY RESPONDED WITH A YET DEEPER THRILL TO THE MAGIC OF THAT MUSIC THE HOURS I SPENT WITH THEE DEAR HEART ARE AS A STRING OF PEARLS TO ME I COUNT THEM OVER EV'RY ONE APART MY ROSARY
THE BEE FOUGHT THE WINDOW ANGRILY UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES THEN FOUND THE OPEN GLASS AND WHIRLED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE JOYFULLY
SHE SMILED AS SHE CAME SLOWLY DOWN THE STEPS
I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT GIVE UP THE NILE TRIP BUT AN EARLY BEE HUMMED IN FROM THE HYACINTHS AND BUZZED AGAINST THE PANE OTHERWISE THE ROOM WAS VERY STILL BUT OF COURSE IF YOU HAD SENT FOR ME I SHOULD HAVE COME
A LOOK OF REAL ANNOYANCE GATHERED UPON GARTH'S FACE HE SPOKE WITH QUIET STERNNESS A FROWN BENDING HIS STRAIGHT BLACK BROWS YOU READ IT QUITE WELL HE SAID BUT YOU DO NOT DO WELL TO DISCUSS IT
TOWERING UP AGAINST THE SKY LIKE THE WEIRD SHAPES OF AN IMPREGNABLE FORTRESS
MY VOICE IN HIS ROOM WOULD MADDEN HIM DOCTOR ROB WAS EQUAL TO THE OCCASION AND WON THE DAY AND GARTH HAVING ONCE GIVEN IN NEVER MENTIONED THE MATTER AGAIN ONLY SOMETIMES I SEE HIM LISTENING AND REMEMBERING
FULL STOP AFTER MATTER NOW LET ME THINK GARTH DROPPED HIS FACE INTO HIS HANDS AND SAT FOR A LONG TIME ABSORBED IN THOUGHT NURSE ROSEMARY WAITED HER RIGHT HAND HELD THE PEN POISED OVER THE PAPER
AND I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF REPORTING ON THE NURSE SECRETARY READER AND UNSPEAKABLY PATIENT GUIDE AND COMPANION HE PROVIDED FOR ME
AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
VOLUNTEERING TO SING VELMA'S SONG
FROM INFANCY IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT TO ME TO WRITE ANYTHING BEYOND THAT STOCK COMMENCEMENT I HOPE YOU ARE QUITE WELL AND I APPROACH THE TASK OF A DESCRIPTIVE LETTER WITH AN EFFORT WHICH IS COLOSSAL AND YET
BUT NOW A YOUNG MAN WITH A WHITE FACE AND BLAZING EYES HAD UNCEREMONIOUSLY SWUNG HER ROUND ORDERED HER UP THE STAIRS AND COMMANDED HER TO SING A SONG OVER AGAIN NOTE FOR NOTE WORD FOR WORD AND SHE WAS MEEKLY GOING TO OBEY
MY DEAR JEANETTE CERTAINLY I WILL COME I WILL LEAVE EUSTON ON FRIDAY EVENING I CAN SPEND THE WHOLE OF SATURDAY AND MOST OF SUNDAY AT GLENEESH BUT MUST BE HOME IN TIME FOR MONDAY'S WORK
BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY
YOU KNOW HE IS ALWAYS SO VERY JUST THERE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOCTOR HAD MADE HIM TO MANY A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF TROUBLE HE WAS THROUGH THE LINE OF PORTERS AND HAD HIS HAND UPON THE HANDLE OF JANE'S DOOR IN A MOMENT
CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER GRADUALLY BECAME MORE SOLID AND DISTINCT UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ROSE FROM THE SEA A STRONG WHITE WALL
WITHOUT A WORD SHE QUIETLY MOUNTED THE STEPS AND WALKED ACROSS THE PLATFORM TO THE PIANO PEOPLE WERE STILL APPLAUDING AND REDOUBLED THEIR DEMONSTRATIONS OF DELIGHT AS SHE APPEARED BUT JANE TOOK HER SEAT AT THE INSTRUMENT WITHOUT GIVING THEM A THOUGHT
AND TAKING ALL OUR MISTAKES AND FAILINGS AND FOOLISHNESSES CAUSE THEM TO WORK TO OUR MOST PERFECT WELL BEING THE MORE INTRICATE AND INVOLVED THIS PROBLEM OF HUMAN EXISTENCE BECOMES THE GREATER THE NEED TO TAKE AS OUR OWN CLEAR RULE OF LIFE
HELD THE LETTER SILENTLY FOR A MOMENT THEN PASSED HIS FINGERS SLOWLY OVER THE SEAL NURSE ROSEMARY WATCHED HIM ANXIOUSLY HE MADE NO REMARK BUT AFTER A MOMENT
SOME SECRET CARE BESIDES THE NATURAL ANXIETY OF HAVING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS CASE IS WEARING HER OUT SHE MAY CONFIDE IN YOU SHE CANNOT QUITE BRING HERSELF TO TRUST IN YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT
FOR WITHIN THE PRECINCT OF FORT CAROLINE A HOMESICK SQUALID BAND DEJECTED AND WORN DRAGGED THEIR SHRUNKEN LIMBS ABOUT THE SUN SCORCHED AREA OR LAY STRETCHED IN LISTLESS WRETCHEDNESS UNDER THE SHADE OF THE BARRACKS
THERE WERE IN HIS NATURE SEEDS OF NOBLENESS SEEDS DESTINED TO BEAR LITTLE FRUIT CHIVALRY AND HONOR WERE ALWAYS ON HIS LIPS BUT FRANCIS THE FIRST A FORSWORN GENTLEMAN A DESPOTIC KING
OFTEN QUARRELLING BUT STILL DRAWING UP TREASURE FROM THOSE EXHAUSTLESS MINES AND BEARING HOME BOUNTIFUL PROVISION AGAINST THE SEASON OF LENT ON THIS DIM VERGE OF THE KNOWN WORLD THERE WERE OTHER PERILS THAN THOSE OF THE WAVES
BUT A DULL EXILE IN A PETTY FORT BY A HOT AND SICKLY RIVER WITH HARD LABOR BAD FARE PROSPECTIVE FAMINE AND NOTHING TO BREAK THE WEARY SAMENESS BUT SOME PASSING CANOE OR FLOATING ALLIGATOR GATHERED IN KNOTS
THE SURF DASHED HIM BACK FLINGING HIM WITH VIOLENCE ON THE BEACH AMONG THE RECIPIENTS OF HIS BOUNTY WHO SEIZED HIM BY THE ARMS AND LEGS AND WHILE HE CALLED LUSTILY FOR AID
SOME GATHERED PITCH IN THE PINE FORESTS SOME MADE CHARCOAL
BUT IF LAUDONNIERE DOES NOT HANG US ALL I WILL NEVER CALL HIM AN HONEST MAN THEY HAD SOME HOPE OF GETTING PROVISIONS FROM THE INDIANS AT THE MONTH OF THE RIVER AND THEN PUTTING TO SEA AGAIN BUT THIS WAS FRUSTRATED BY LA CAILLE'S SUDDEN ATTACK
THAT THE PETITIONERS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO EMBARK IN THE VESSEL LYING IN THE RIVER AND CRUISE ALONG THE SPANISH MAIN IN ORDER TO PROCURE PROVISIONS BY PURCHASE OR OTHERWISE IN SHORT THE FLOWER OF THE COMPANY WISHED TO TURN BUCCANEERS
HAD THEY PUT FORTH TO MAINTAIN THEMSELVES AT PORT ROYAL THE ENERGY AND RESOURCE WHICH THEY EXERTED TO ESCAPE FROM IT THEY MIGHT HAVE LAID THE CORNERSTONE OF A SOLID COLONY ALL
THEY PLUNDERED AND CAROUSED FOR A WEEK AND HAD HARDLY RE EMBARKED WHEN THEY MET A SMALL VESSEL HAVING ON BOARD THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND
WE RETURNED TO LAND AGAINE ACCOMPANIED WITH THE CAPTAINES GENTLEMEN AND SOULDIERS AND OTHERS OF OUR SMALL TROOPE CARRYING WITH US A PILLOUR OR COLUMNE OF HARDE STONE OUR KING'S ARMES GRAVED THEREIN
AND SENT BACK EMPTY HANDED AND HALF STARVED THEY RETURNED TO THE FORT IN THE WORDS OF LAUDONNIERE ANGRY AND PRICKED DEEPELY TO THE QUICKE FOR BEING SO MOCKED
ONE ASTINA THE PLUNDER OF WHOSE VILLAGES WOULD YIELD AN AMPLE SUPPLY THE OFFER WAS ACCEPTED OTTIGNY AND VASSEUR SET OUT BUT WERE GROSSLY DECEIVED LED AGAINST A DIFFERENT ENEMY
A FRENCH WRITER HOWEVER ADVANCES A MORE AMBITIOUS CLAIM IN THE YEAR FOURTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS AMERICA HE MAINTAINS
TO BEE SHORT IT IS A THING VNSPEAKABLE TO CONSIDER
SO DID SPAIN WATCH AND WAIT TO TRAMPLE AND CRUSH THE HOPE OF HUMANITY IN THESE DAYS OF FEAR A SECOND HUGUENOT COLONY SAILED FOR THE NEW WORLD THE CALM STERN MAN WHO REPRESENTED AND LED THE PROTESTANTISM OF FRANCE
WAR AND INTRIGUE RULED THE DAY AND IN THE WHIRL OF ITALIAN POLITICS THERE WAS NO LEISURE TO THINK OF A NEW WORLD YET PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WAS NOT QUITE BENUMBED IN FIFTEEN O SIX ONE DENIS OF HONFLEUR
THOSE WHO COULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THEIR ARMOR PUT IT ON EMBARKED TO THE NUMBER OF FIFTY IN TWO BARGES AND SAILED UP THE RIVER UNDER LAUDONNIERE HIMSELF HAVING REACHED OUTINA'S LANDING THEY MARCHED INLAND ENTERED HIS VILLAGE
FOR A TIME THEY BUSIED THEMSELVES WITH FINISHING THEIR FORT AND THIS DONE SET FORTH IN QUEST OF ADVENTURES THE INDIANS HAD LOST FEAR OF THEM RIBAUT HAD ENJOINED UPON THEM TO USE ALL KINDNESS AND GENTLENESS IN THEIR DEALING WITH THE MEN OF THE WOODS
A PLACE VERY FITTE FOR THAT PURPOSE UPON A LITTLE HILL COMPASSED WITH CYPRES BAYES PAULMES AND OTHER TREES WITH SWEETE SMELLING AND PLEASANT SHRUBBES
THEY WERE ALONE IN THOSE FEARFUL SOLITUDES FROM THE NORTH POLE TO MEXICO THERE WAS NO CHRISTIAN DENIZEN BUT THEY THE PRESSING QUESTION WAS HOW THEY WERE TO SUBSIST THEIR THOUGHT WAS NOT OF SUBSISTENCE BUT OF GOLD
IN MARRIAGE TO HIS GREAT ALLY BUT AS THE BRIDE WITH HER BRIDESMAIDS WAS JOURNEYING TOWARDS CALOS ESCORTED BY A CHOSEN BAND THEY WERE ASSAILED BY A WILD AND WARLIKE RACE INHABITANTS OF AN ISLAND CALLED
THE DRENCHED VOYAGERS GAVE UP ALL FOR LOST AT LENGTH SHE RIGHTED THE GALE SUBSIDED THE WIND CHANGED AND THE CRAZY WATER LOGGED VESSEL AGAIN BORE SLOWLY TOWARDS FRANCE GNAWED WITH FAMINE
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES OFF THE MOUTH OF A GREAT RIVER RIDING AT ANCHOR ON A SUNNY SEA THEY LOWERED THEIR BOATS CROSSED THE BAR THAT OBSTRUCTED THE ENTRANCE
AS KNEELING ON THE GROUND THEY GAVE THANKS TO GOD WHO HAD GUIDED THEIR VOYAGE TO AN ISSUE FULL OF PROMISE THE INDIANS SEATED GRAVELY UNDER THE NEIGHBORING TREES LOOKED ON IN SILENT RESPECT THINKING THAT THEY WORSHIPPED THE SUN
UTTERED MOANS AND OUTCRIES FROM THE STRAND YET NO RANSOM WAS OFFERED SINCE REASONING FROM THEIR OWN INSTINCTS THEY NEVER DOUBTED THAT AFTER THE PRICE WAS PAID THE CAPTIVE WOULD BE PUT TO DEATH LAUDONNIERE
AND THE BEDAUBED AND BEFEATHERED WARRIORS THE DRUMMING DANCING AND STAMPING THE WILD LAMENTATION OF THE WOMEN AS THEY GASHED THE ARMS OF THE YOUNG GIRLS WITH SHARP MUSSEL SHELLS AND FLUNG THE BLOOD INTO THE AIR WITH DISMAL OUTCRIES
MARRIED HIS DAUGHTER AND IN HIS ABSENCE REIGNED IN HIS STEAD BUT AS HIS SWAY VERGED TOWARDS DESPOTISM HIS SUBJECTS TOOK OFFENCE AND SPLIT HIS HEAD WITH A HATCHET DURING THE WINTER
AND THE WRETCHED BRIGANTINE WITH SAILS CLOSE REEFED TOSSED AMONG THE SAVAGE BILLOWS AT THE MERCY OF THE STORM A HEAVY SEA ROLLED DOWN UPON HER AND BURST THE BULWARKS ON THE WINDWARD SIDE THE SURGES BROKE OVER HER AND CLINGING WITH DESPERATE GRIP
WAS BROUGHT TO A PARTIAL HEAD BY ONE LA ROQUETTE WHO GAVE OUT THAT HIGH UP THE RIVER HE HAD DISCOVERED BY MAGIC A MINE OF GOLD AND SILVER WHICH WOULD GIVE EACH OF THEM A SHARE OF TEN THOUSAND CROWNS
WHICH THEY FASTEN ONTO A NARROWE GIRDLE MADE OF GRASSE THEY ARE OF COLOUR RUSSET AND NOT MUCH UNLIKE THE SARACENS THEIR HAYRE BLACKE THICKE AND NOT VERY LONG WHICH THEY TYE TOGEATHER IN A KNOT BEHINDE AND WEARE IT LIKE A TAILE
HIS FRIENDS SHOULD NOT WANT HOW LONG THIS FRIENDSHIP WOULD HAVE LASTED MAY WELL BE DOUBTED WITH THE PERCEPTION THAT THE DEPENDANTS ON THEIR BOUNTY WERE NO DEMIGODS
THAT I WOULD DEPRIVE THEM OF THIS GREAT GAME IN THAT I DID SET THEM DAYLY ON WORKE NOT SENDING THEM ON EVERY SIDE TO DISCOVER THE COUNTREYS THEREFORE THAT IT WERE A GOOD DEEDE TO DISPATCH MEE OUT OF THE WAY
HE SHARED THE IDEAS AND HABITS OF HIS CLASS NOR IS THERE REASON TO BELIEVE HIM TO HAVE BEEN IN ADVANCE OF HIS TIME IN A KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SUCCESSFUL COLONIZATION HIS SCHEME PROMISED A MILITARY COLONY NOT A FREE COMMONWEALTH
AND THE BRAVE SWISS ARLAC WAS THE ONLY OFFICER WHO HELD TO HIS DUTY A SEVERE ILLNESS AGAIN SEIZED LAUDONNIERE AND CONFINED HIM TO HIS BED
WAS FOUND BY FRENCHMEN COUSIN
BUT AS THE NOISY AND IMPERTINENT GUESTS SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO UNDUE MERRIMENT THE CHIEF SHUT THEM ALL IN HIS WIGWAM LEST THEIR GENTILE EYES SHOULD PROFANE THE MYSTERIES HERE IMMURED IN DARKNESS
AND THEY HAD ALSO THE SPANISH BRIGANTINE BROUGHT BY THE MUTINEERS BUT THESE VESSELS WERE INSUFFICIENT AND THEY PREPARED TO BUILD A NEW ONE THE ENERGY OF REVIVING HOPE LENT NEW LIFE TO THEIR EXHAUSTED FRAMES
INVITED THEM TO THE GRAND RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL OF HIS TRIBE WHEN THEY ARRIVED THEY FOUND THE VILLAGE ALIVE WITH PREPARATION AND TROOPS OF WOMEN BUSIED IN SWEEPING THE GREAT CIRCULAR AREA WHERE THE CEREMONIES WERE TO TAKE PLACE
MEN OF THE SWORD BORN WITHIN THE PALE OF NOBILITY
WOODS FRESH WITH YOUNG VERDURE MEADOWS BRIGHT WITH FLOWERS THE PALM THE CYPRESS THE PINE THE MAGNOLIA THE GRAZING DEER HERONS CURLEWS BITTERNS WOODCOCK AND UNKNOWN WATER FOWL
LEST THEY SHOULD PAY THE PENALTY OF THEIR EXTORTION THEY WOULD NOT ENTER THE FORT
ANOTHER THE COMMANDANT WITNESSES WERE CALLED WITH ARGUMENTS AND SPEECHES ON EITHER SIDE
THE ROCKS AND SHORES OF THOSE SEQUESTERED SEAS HAD SO THOUGHT THE VOYAGERS OTHER TENANTS THAN THE SEAL THE WALRUS AND THE SCREAMING SEA FOWL THE BEARS WHICH STOLE AWAY THEIR FISH BEFORE THEIR EYES AND THE WILD NATIVES DRESSED IN SEAL SKINS
TOO HIGH IN POWER AND RANK TO BE OPENLY ASSAILED WAS FORCED TO ACT WITH CAUTION HE MUST ACT TOO IN THE NAME OF THE CROWN AND IN VIRTUE OF HIS OFFICE OF ADMIRAL OF FRANCE A NOBLEMAN AND A SOLDIER FOR THE ADMIRAL OF FRANCE WAS NO SEAMAN
BY TWO OR THREE WEEKS OF EXPLORATION THEY SEEM TO HAVE GAINED A CLEAR IDEA OF THIS RICH SEMI AQUATIC REGION RIBAUT DESCRIBES IT AS
HOPES HAD BEEN DASHED AND WILD EXPECTATIONS HAD COME TO NAUGHT
AT ANY RATE HE REPLIED WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY YET
BUT SAID I THE CLOTHES AND THAT MASS OF LADDERS AND ROPES WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THEM
THE RECTOR REPEATED THE PROFESSOR IT SEEMS AXEL THAT THIS GOOD MAN IS THE RECTOR OUR GUIDE IN THE MEANWHILE WAS MAKING THE KYRKOHERDE AWARE OF THE POSITION OF THINGS WHEN THE LATTER SUSPENDING HIS LABOURS FOR A MOMENT
SHUT UP INSIDE AN IMMEASURABLE EXCAVATION ITS WIDTH COULD NOT BE ESTIMATED SINCE THE SHORE RAN WIDENING AS FAR AS EYE COULD REACH NOR COULD ITS LENGTH FOR THE DIM HORIZON BOUNDED THE NEW AS FOR ITS HEIGHT IT
GRANITE ROCKS SOFTEN INTENSE HEAT CONVERTS SOLID BODIES INTO THICK FLUIDS THE WATERS AGAIN COVER THE FACE OF THE EARTH THEY BOIL THEY RISE IN WHIRLING EDDIES OF STEAM
HANS AND MY UNCLE CLINGING TO THE WALL TRIED TO NIBBLE A FEW BITS OF BISCUIT LONG MOANS ESCAPED FROM MY SWOLLEN LIPS AFTER SOME TIME MY UNCLE APPROACHED ME AND RAISED ME IN HIS ARMS
STILL I HAD COURAGEOUSLY SHOULDERED MY BURDEN AGAIN AND WAS RAPIDLY FOLLOWING HANS WHOM MY UNCLE PRECEDED I WAS ANXIOUS NOT TO BE LEFT BEHIND MY GREATEST CARE WAS NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF MY COMPANIONS
BUT AN IMPATIENT CURIOSITY IMPELLED OUR STEPS CRACKLING AND RATTLING OUR FEET WERE TRAMPLING ON THE REMAINS OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND INTERESTING FOSSILS THE POSSESSION OF WHICH IS A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND CONTENTION
IT IS THE SHELL OF A CRUSTACEAN OF AN EXTINCT SPECIES CALLED A TRILOBITE NOTHING MORE BUT DON'T YOU CONCLUDE JUST WHAT YOU CONCLUDE YOURSELF YES I DO PERFECTLY
MY HAIR STOOD ON END WITH TERROR THE BEWILDERING FEELING OF VACUITY LAID HOLD UPON ME I FELT MY CENTRE OF GRAVITY SHIFTING ITS PLACE AND GIDDINESS MOUNTING INTO MY BRAIN LIKE DRUNKENNESS
MY UNCLE WITH DIFFICULTY PERSUADING HIM TO ACCEPT A PROPER REMUNERATION AND HANS SIGNALLED THE START AT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM GARDAER THE SOIL BEGAN TO CHANGE ITS ASPECT
CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
I WILL LOOK I HAD NOT GONE A HUNDRED PACES BEFORE INCONTESTABLE PROOFS PRESENTED THEMSELVES IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
AT LAST ON TUESDAY JULY EIGHTH WE ARRIVED ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES AND HALF DEAD AT THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO ROADS THERE I DROPPED LIKE A LIFELESS LUMP EXTENDED ON THE LAVA SOIL IT WAS TEN IN THE MORNING
THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND FEET LONG UNDULATING LIKE VAST SERPENTS BEYOND THE REACH OF SIGHT I FOUND SOME AMUSEMENT IN TRACING THESE ENDLESS WAVES ALWAYS THINKING I SHOULD COME TO THE END OF THEM
HAVE RECOGNISED IN THESE BONES NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTH AND OTHER MAMMALS OF THE POST TERTIARY PERIOD BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIMEN TO DOUBT WOULD BE TO INSULT SCIENCE THERE STANDS THE BODY YOU MAY SEE IT TOUCH IT
IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
WE HAD GONE BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS BUT MY UNCLE RAPIDLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AHA WILL FATE PLAY TRICKS UPON ME WILL THE ELEMENTS LAY PLOTS AGAINST ME
OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM
SAID MY UNCLE AND INHABITED TOO TO BE SURE SAID I AND WHY SHOULD NOT THESE WATERS YIELD TO US
THIS FOSSIL BODY WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS IMMENSE CATACOMB WE CAME UPON OTHER BODIES AT EVERY STEP AMONGST THIS MORTAL DUST AND MY UNCLE MIGHT SELECT THE MOST CURIOUS OF THESE SPECIMENS TO DEMOLISH THE INCREDULITY OF SCEPTICS
BUT IT IS THE VERY LAST YOU HEAR THE LAST I HAD KEPT IT AS A PRECIOUS TREASURE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY FLASK TWENTY TIMES NAY A HUNDRED TIMES HAVE I FOUGHT AGAINST A FRIGHTFUL IMPULSE TO DRINK IT OFF BUT NO AXEL I KEPT IT FOR YOU
ACCORDING TO YOUR SYSTEM SAID MY UNCLE
OF WHICH AN ANCIENT PEOPLE GAVE ITS NAME TO THIS SYSTEM SPECIMENS OF MAGNIFICENT MARBLES CLOTHED THE WALLS SOME OF A GREYISH AGATE FANTASTICALLY VEINED WITH WHITE OTHERS OF RICH CRIMSON OR YELLOW DASHED WITH SPLOTCHES OF RED
I SOON FOUND OUT THE CAUSE AND HOPE DAWNED AGAIN IN MY HEART FOR THIS REASON OF THE THREE WAYS OPEN BEFORE US ONE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY SAKNUSSEMM THE INDICATIONS OF THE LEARNED ICELANDER HINTED AT IN THE CRYPTOGRAM
TREADING WITH UNSTEADY FEET THE COLOURED MARLS AND THE PARTICOLOURED CLAYS I LEAN FOR SUPPORT AGAINST THE TRUNKS OF IMMENSE CONIFERS I LIE IN THE SHADE OF SPHENOPHYLLA
THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
I THEN REMEMBERED THAT WE HAD SEARCHED FOR IT IN VAIN THE EVENING BEFORE MY UNCLE QUESTIONED HANS WHO AFTER HAVING EXAMINED ATTENTIVELY WITH THE EYE OF A HUNTSMAN REPLIED
DEEP SHADOWS REPOSED UPON THEIR LOWER WREATHS AND OFTEN BETWEEN TWO SEPARATED FIELDS OF CLOUD THERE GLIDED DOWN A RAY OF UNSPEAKABLE LUSTRE BUT IT WAS NOT SOLAR LIGHT AND THERE WAS NO HEAT
AND FOR HOURS MY PATIENCE WAS VYING WITH MY SURPRISE WHAT NATURAL FORCE COULD HAVE PRODUCED SUCH PLANTS AND WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE APPEARANCE OF THE EARTH IN THE FIRST AGES OF ITS FORMATION WHEN UNDER THE ACTION OF HEAT AND MOISTURE
NOW ERUPTIONS ARE ALWAYS PRECEDED BY CERTAIN WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA I HAVE THEREFORE EXAMINED THE NATIVES I HAVE STUDIED EXTERNAL APPEARANCES AND I CAN ASSURE YOU AXEL THAT THERE WILL BE NO ERUPTION AT THIS POSITIVE AFFIRMATION I STOOD AMAZED AND SPEECHLESS
I PICKED UP A PERFECTLY FORMED SHELL WHICH HAD BELONGED TO AN ANIMAL NOT UNLIKE THE WOODLOUSE THEN JOINING MY UNCLE I SAID LOOK AT THIS VERY WELL SAID HE QUIETLY
HE ASKED YES CERTAINLY AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE DELIGHTFUL WELL TAKE MY ARM AXEL AND LET US FOLLOW THE WINDINGS OF THE SHORE I EAGERLY ACCEPTED AND WE BEGAN TO COAST ALONG THIS NEW SEA
BUT I CANNOT BE SURE OF THAT UNTIL I HAVE REACHED THE VERY END OF THIS GALLERY YOU ARE RIGHT IN DOING THIS MY UNCLE AND I SHOULD QUITE APPROVE OF YOUR DETERMINATION IF THERE WERE NOT A DANGER THREATENING US NEARER AND NEARER WHAT DANGER THE WANT OF WATER
THE ORDER OF THESE VOLCANIC FORMATIONS AFFORDS THE STRONGEST CONFIRMATION TO THE THEORIES OF DAVY
IT EXTENDS ALONG THE INNER EDGE OF A SMALL FIORD INCLOSED BETWEEN BASALTIC WALLS OF THE STRANGEST CONSTRUCTION BASALT IS A BROWNISH ROCK OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN IT ASSUMES REGULAR FORMS THE ARRANGEMENT OF WHICH IS OFTEN VERY SURPRISING
SOMETIMES HE DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER BEHIND THE HUGE BLOCKS THEN A SHRILL WHISTLE WOULD DIRECT US ON OUR WAY TO HIM SOMETIMES HE WOULD HALT PICK UP A FEW BITS OF STONE BUILD THEM UP INTO A RECOGNISABLE FORM
CLIMATES ARE NO MORE THE HEAT OF THE GLOBE CONTINUALLY INCREASES AND NEUTRALISES THAT OF THE SUN VEGETATION BECOMES ACCELERATED I GLIDE LIKE A SHADE AMONGST ARBORESCENT FERNS
THANK YOU THANK YOU I SAID ALTHOUGH MY THIRST WAS ONLY PARTIALLY QUENCHED YET SOME STRENGTH HAD RETURNED THE MUSCLES OF MY THROAT UNTIL THEN CONTRACTED NOW RELAXED AGAIN AND THE INFLAMMATION OF MY LIPS ABATED SOMEWHAT
BUT OBJECTS BEARING THE TRACES OF HIS HANDIWORK SUCH AS FOSSIL LEG BONES OF ANIMALS SCULPTURED AND CARVED EVIDENTLY BY THE HAND OF MAN
AND HAD SAVED THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THE ARTICLES AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE NOT THAT WE HAD SUFFERED NO LOSSES FOR INSTANCE OUR FIREARMS BUT WE MIGHT DO WITHOUT THEM OUR STOCK OF POWDER HAD REMAINED UNINJURED
ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION
BUT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR WAS FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE BROAD SMILES PROVOKED BY HIS LEARNED ECCENTRICITIES YES HE PURSUED WITH ANIMATION THIS IS A FOSSIL MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE MASTODONS WHOSE REMAINS FILL THIS AMPHITHEATRE
THE EASTERN AND WESTERN STRANDS SPREAD WIDE AS IF TO BID US FAREWELL BEFORE OUR EYES LAY FAR AND WIDE A VAST SEA SHADOWS OF GREAT CLOUDS SWEPT HEAVILY OVER ITS SILVER GREY SURFACE
DON'T YOU HEAR THE HAMMER AT WORK HANS IS ALREADY BUSY AT IT WHAT HAS HE ALREADY FELLED THE TREES OH THE TREES WERE ALREADY DOWN COME AND YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF
GROWLED SAM KITTERIDGE BITTERLY RESENTING THE STERN EDICT WHICH FORBADE FREE BORN CITIZENS TO BURN AS MUCH GUNPOWDER AS THEY LIKED ON THAT GLORIOUS DAY LAST YEAR JIMMY GOT HIS ARM BLOWN OFF WHEN THEY FIRED THE OLD CANNON
AND PLANNING TO DO THE HONORS HANDSOMELY TO THE BOYS IT WAS VERY WARM AND JUST OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN THEY PAUSED BY A WAYSIDE WATERING TROUGH TO WASH THEIR DUSTY FACES

WHO FELT BITTERLY TOWARD ALL MANKIND AT THAT INSTANT BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WAS NO HOPE OF HIS GOING SAY THAT AGAIN AND I'LL KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF AND BEN FACED ROUND WITH A GESTURE WHICH CAUSED THE OTHER TO SKIP OUT OF REACH PRECIPITATELY
AS IF THEIR LIVES DEPENDED ON IT EVERY ONE TALKING IN HIS GRUFFEST TONE BAWLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE SQUABBLING OVER EVERY POINT OF THE GAME AND SEEMING TO ENJOY HIMSELF IMMENSELY IN SPITE OF THE HEAT DUST UPROAR
SMOOTHING AWAY ALL OBJECTIONS FOR HE LIKED BEN AND SAW THAT HE WANTED TO GO NO I WON'T I DON'T LIKE HIM HE WINKS AT ME AND GROWLS WHEN I TOUCH HIM MUTTERED NAUGHTY CY REMEMBERING HOW MUCH REASON POOR SANCH HAD TO DISTRUST HIS TORMENTOR

FISHING OUT SEVERAL FRAGMENTS OF GINGERBREAD STARVING AND BAB ATE THEM WITH SUCH A RELISH THAT SAM ADDED A SMALL CONTRIBUTION AND BEN CAUGHT SOME WATER FOR HER IN HIS HAND WHERE THE LITTLE SPRING BUBBLED UP BESIDE A STONE NOW

SO YOU SHALL TAKE HER THESE BAB AND BETTY MAY CARRY BABY HOME FOR THE NIGHT SHE IS SO NICELY ASLEEP IT IS A PITY TO WAKE HER GOOD BY TILL TO MORROW LITTLE NEIGHBORS CONTINUED MISS CELIA AND DISMISSED THE GIRLS WITH A KISS IS BEN COMING TOO
AND BEN SWAYED ABOUT IN HIS CHAIR AS IF HE WAS ALREADY DOING IT IN IMAGINATION YOU MAY TAKE A TURN ROUND MY FIELD ON LITA ANY DAY SHE WOULD LIKE IT
ASKED BAB AS BETTY TROTTED OFF IN A SILENT RAPTURE WITH THE BIG DARLING BOBBING OVER HER SHOULDER NOT YET I'VE SEVERAL THINGS TO SETTLE WITH MY NEW MAN TELL MOTHER HE WILL COME BY AND BY OFF RUSHED BAB WITH THE PLATEFUL OF GOODIES
FOR THERE WAS A QUIVER IN HER VOICE THE MEANING OF WHICH HE FELT BEFORE HE UNDERSTOOD MISS CELIA PUT HER ARMS ABOUT HIM AND ANSWERED VERY TENDERLY BEN DEAR IF I WERE TO TELL YOU THAT HE WAS NEVER COMING BACK
DON'T YOU BOTHER WE DON'T WANT ANY GIRLS TAGGING AFTER US SAID SAM WALKING OFF TO ESCAPE THE ANNOYANCE I'LL BRING YOU A ROLL OF CHICKERBERRY LOZENGERS IF YOU WON'T TEASE
BUT BEN THOUGHT THERE NEVER WAS SO SWEET A LADY AS THE ONE WHO LEANED OVER HIM TO SHOW HIM HOW THE DISSECTED MAP WENT TOGETHER AND NEVER SMILED AT HIS MISTAKES
AND I'LL GO HOME ALONE I AIN'T AFRAID SANCH WILL TAKE CARE OF ME IF YOU WON'T ANSWERED BAB STOUTLY WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE YOUR MOTHER WILL SAY TO YOU ASKED BEN FEELING MUCH REPROACHED BY HER LAST WORDS
OF BEN BROWN THE ELDER'S DEATH THERE WAS LITTLE TO TELL EXCEPT THAT HE WAS KILLED IN SOME WILD PLACE AT THE WEST AND A STRANGER WROTE THE FACT TO THE ONLY PERSON WHOSE NAME WAS FOUND IN BEN'S POCKET BOOK MISTER SMITHERS OFFERED TO TAKE THE BOY BACK AND
COULD ONLY WHINE AND LICK AWAY THE TEARS THAT WET THE HALF HIDDEN FACE QUESTIONING THE NEW FRIEND MEANTIME WITH EYES SO FULL OF DUMB LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND SORROW THAT THEY SEEMED ALMOST HUMAN WIPING AWAY HER OWN TEARS
ANSWERED SAM PRODUCING HALF A DOLLAR AS IF SUCH MAGNIFICENT SUMS WERE NO STRANGERS TO HIS POCKET COME ON BROWN YOU'LL BE A FIRST RATE FELLOW TO SHOW US ROUND AS YOU KNOW ALL THE DODGES SAID BILLY
WHO GO GALLOPING AWAY IN A CLOUD OF DUST
TIRED TEACHER HAD DISMISSED THEM FOR EIGHT WHOLE WEEKS AND GONE AWAY TO REST THE LITTLE SCHOOL HOUSE WAS SHUT UP LESSONS WERE OVER SPIRITS RISING FAST AND VACATION HAD BEGUN THE QUIET TOWN SEEMED SUDDENLY INUNDATED WITH CHILDREN
FOR PRESENTLY THE SOUND OF MUSIC FLOATED OUT FROM THE PARLOR MUSIC SO SOFT SO SWEET THAT INVOLUNTARILY THE BOY STOPPED HIS CRYING TO LISTEN THEN QUIETER TEARS DROPPED SLOWLY
HOW LONG SHE PLAYED MISS CELIA NEVER MINDED BUT WHEN SHE STOLE OUT TO SEE IF BEN HAD GONE SHE FOUND THAT OTHER FRIENDS EVEN KINDER THAN HERSELF
COULD YOU BEAR IT I GUESS I COULD BUT YOU DON'T MEAN IT OH MA'AM HE ISN'T DEAD CRIED BEN
YOU JUST CATCH HOLD OF THIS AND RUN ALONG HOME LOCK SANCH UP FOR AN HOUR AND TELL YOUR MOTHER I'M ALL RIGHT ANSWERED BEN BOUND TO ASSERT HIS MANLY SUPREMACY BEFORE HIS MATES HE'S GOING TO THE CIRCUS
SHE IS SO NICELY ASLEEP IT IS A PITY TO WAKE HER GOOD BY TILL TO MORROW LITTLE NEIGHBORS CONTINUED MISS CELIA AND DISMISSED THE GIRLS WITH A KISS IS BEN COMING TOO
AND BOTH SUPPRESSED AN ASTONISHED HULLO FOR THERE STOOD BAB WAITING FOR SANCHO TO LAP HIS FILL OUT OF THE OVERFLOWING TROUGH SUCH A SHABBY TIRED LOOKING COUPLE AS THEY WERE
SOMETHING IN MISS CELIA'S VOICE AS SHE SAID THE LAST TWO WORDS WITH HER HAND ON BEN'S SHOULDER MADE HIM LOOK UP QUICKLY AND TURN RED WITH PLEASURE WONDERING WHAT THE SQUIRE HAD WRITTEN ABOUT HIM MOTHER MUST HAVE SOME OF THE PARTY
AND COOL OFF BEFORE PLUNGING INTO THE EXCITEMENTS OF THE AFTERNOON AS THEY STOOD REFRESHING THEMSELVES A BAKER'S CART CAME JINGLING BY AND SAM PROPOSED A HASTY LUNCH WHILE THEY RESTED A SUPPLY OF GINGERBREAD WAS SOON BOUGHT
I THOUGHT OF THAT AND PLANNED HOW I'D FIX IT IF I DIDN'T FIND BEN I'D MAKE SANCH DO HIS TRICKS AND GET A QUARTER THAT WAY SO NOW ANSWERED BAB UNDAUNTED BY ANY OBSTACLE I DO BELIEVE SHE WOULD
WELL HE WON'T LIKE THAT NOR YOU EITHER
HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE ASKED LEAVE TO GO AND BEEN KINDER TO BAB
AND MISS CELIA'S EYES TURNED TO THE DEEP SKY WHERE EARLY STARS WERE SHINING DIDN'T HE SEND FOR ME WHERE'S HE GONE WHEN S HE COMING BACK ASKED BEN QUICKLY
SAID BETTY ENJOYING A LAST HUG OF THE FASCINATING DOLL WHOSE LIDS WOULD SHUT SO THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SING BYE SWEET BABY BYE WITH NO STARING EYES TO SPOIL THE ILLUSION WHAT HEAPS SHE KNOWS
TRYING TO PULL HIM AFTER HER AS SHE TRUDGED ON BOUND TO SEE THE OUTSIDE OF THAT WONDERFUL TENT EVEN IF SHE NEVER GOT IN BUT SANCHO HAD HEARD A SOFT CHIRRUP AND WITH A SUDDEN BOUND TWITCHED THE STRAP AWAY SPRANG UP THE BANK
HE'LL GET LOST OR STOLEN IF I TAKE HIM AND IT'S TOO FAR TO CARRY HIM HOME IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY BEGAN BEN PERSUADING HIMSELF THAT THIS WAS THE TRUE REASON OF HIS DELAY LET CY TAKE HIM BACK HE'LL DO IT FOR A CENT WON'T YOU CY PROPOSED BILLY
HE KNEW HE WAS AN ORPHAN NOW AND TURNED INSTINCTIVELY TO THE OLD FRIEND WHO LOVED HIM BEST THROWING HIMSELF DOWN BESIDE HIS DOG BEN CLUNG ABOUT THE CURLY NECK SOBBING BITTERLY
AND GUARDING JACKETS WHEN NOT NEEDED WITH THE AIR OF ONE OF THE OLD GUARD ON DUTY AT THE TOMB OF NAPOLEON BAB ALSO LONGED TO JOIN IN THE FUN WHICH SUITED HER BETTER THAN STUPID PICNICS OR FUSSING OVER DOLLS
THEN SO SAD THAT IF ANY ONE HAD BEEN LOOKING HE WOULD HAVE WONDERED WHAT BAD NEWS HAD CHASED AWAY THE SUNSHINE SO SUDDENLY NO ONE DID LOOK
AND DRAWING BEN DOWN BESIDE HER ON THE WIDE STEP MISS CELIA TOOK OUT THE LETTERS WITH A SHADOW CREEPING OVER HER FACE AS SOFTLY AS THE TWILIGHT WAS STEALING OVER THE WORLD WHILE THE DEW FELL AND EVERY THING GREW STILL AND DIM
AND THE RIDERS FLYING ABOUT IN THE AIR AS IF THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION NO LONGER EXISTED BUT BEST OF ALL WAS THE GRAND CONGLOMERATION OF ANIMALS WHERE THE GIRAFFE APPEARS TO STAND ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK
YOU CAN'T YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM OH DADDY DADDY IF I'D ONLY SEEN YOU JEST ONCE MORE NO ONE COULD GRANT THAT WISH BUT MISS CELIA DID COMFORT HIM
AND IF HE DID HE'D SEND FOR ME I'D LIKE TO GO THERE IT'S A REAL SPLENDID PLACE THEY SAY HE HAS GONE FURTHER AWAY THAN THAT TO A LOVELIER COUNTRY THAN CALIFORNIA I HOPE AND MISS CELIA'S EYES TURNED TO THE DEEP SKY
IF IT BE ASSUMED THAT IT BE NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD NOTHING WILL FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE
DIFFER FROM THE PLEASURE AND PAIN FELT BY ANOTHER MAN ONLY IN SO FAR AS THE NATURE OR ESSENCE OF THE ONE MAN DIFFERS FROM THE ESSENCE OF THE OTHER CONSEQUENTLY ANY EMOTION OF ONE INDIVIDUAL ONLY DIFFERS
FOR IN SO FAR AS EACH LOVES THE SAME THING THE LOVE OF EACH IS FOSTERED THEREBY
IN OTHER WORDS OBVIOUSLY THAT WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE INTELLECT IN REPRESENTATION MUST NECESSARILY BE GRANTED IN NATURE
HENCE IT FOLLOWS FIRST THAT THE HUMAN MIND PERCEIVES THE NATURE OF A VARIETY OF BODIES TOGETHER WITH THE NATURE OF ITS OWN
THAT BY THE SAME NECESSITY OF ITS NATURE WHEREBY IT EXISTS IT LIKEWISE WORKS
IF FROM THIS ABSURDITY OF THEIRS THEY PERSIST IN DRAWING THE CONCLUSION THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE MUST BE FINITE THEY WILL IN GOOD SOOTH BE ACTING LIKE A MAN WHO ASSERTS THAT CIRCLES HAVE THE PROPERTIES OF SQUARES
SUBSTANCE ABSOLUTELY INFINITE COULD CEASE TO EXIST
FOR MEN ARE WONT TO FORM GENERAL IDEAS OF THINGS NATURAL NO LESS THAN OF THINGS ARTIFICIAL AND SUCH IDEAS THEY HOLD AS TYPES BELIEVING THAT NATURE WHO THEY THINK DOES NOTHING WITHOUT AN OBJECT HAS THEM IN VIEW AND HAS SET THEM
THAT IS OF AFFIRMATION OR NEGATION IN ORDER TO ASSENT TO AN INFINITY OF THINGS WHICH WE DO NOT PERCEIVE BUT THAT THEY HAVE NEED OF AN INCREASE IN THEIR FACULTY OF UNDERSTANDING
AND AS NO ONE ENDEAVOURS TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF HIS OWN NATURE IT FOLLOWS FIRST THAT THE FOUNDATION OF VIRTUE IS THE ENDEAVOUR TO PRESERVE ONE'S OWN BEING AND THAT HAPPINESS CONSISTS
WHEN THE MIND CONCEIVES ITSELF AND ITS POWER OF ACTIVITY IT FEELS PLEASURE
AS THEIR DEFINITIONS ALREADY GIVEN SHOW NOW BY PAIN WE MEAN THAT THE MIND'S POWER OF THINKING IS DIMINISHED OR CHECKED
IT IS NECESSARILY GOOD PROOF IN SO FAR AS A THING IS IN HARMONY WITH OUR NATURE IT CANNOT BE BAD FOR IT IT WILL THEREFORE NECESSARILY BE EITHER GOOD OR INDIFFERENT
I DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IT IS EVIDENT I REPEAT FROM THAT PROOF THAT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD LIKE HIS ESSENCE IS AN ETERNAL TRUTH FURTHER
THIS MUST BE ADMITTED BY ALL WHO KNOW CLEAR REASON TO BE INFALLIBLE AND MOST OF ALL BY THOSE WHO DENY THE POSSIBILITY OF A VACUUM FOR IF EXTENDED SUBSTANCE COULD BE SO DIVIDED THAT ITS PARTS WERE REALLY SEPARATE
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE SAY THAT TO BE INHABITED IS THE FINAL CAUSE OF THIS OR THAT HOUSE WE MEAN NOTHING MORE THAN THAT A MAN CONCEIVING THE CONVENIENCES OF HOUSEHOLD LIFE HAD A DESIRE TO BUILD A HOUSE WHEREFORE
BUT DESIRE WHICH ARISES FROM THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL THOUGH IT BE CONCERNED WITH THINGS WHICH ARE GOOD AT THE MOMENT CAN BE QUENCHED OR CONTROLLED BY ANY HEADSTRONG DESIRE
IS NOT MEASURABLE AND CANNOT BE COMPOSED OF FINITE PARTS
PROOF BESIDES GOD
THEREFORE IN SO FAR AS A THING IS IN HARMONY WITH OUR NATURE IT IS NECESSARILY GOOD
WHETHER IT BE MORE PERFECT OR LESS PERFECT WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO PERSIST IN EXISTENCE WITH THE SAME FORCE WHEREWITH IT BEGAN TO EXIST WHEREFORE IN THIS RESPECT ALL THINGS ARE EQUAL DEFINITIONS
IT CAME ABOUT THAT EACH MAN CALLED PERFECT THAT WHICH HE SAW AGREE WITH THE GENERAL IDEA HE HAD FORMED OF THE THING IN QUESTION AND CALLED IMPERFECT THAT WHICH HE SAW AGREE LESS WITH HIS OWN PRECONCEIVED TYPE
GOD OR SUBSTANCE CONSISTING OF INFINITE ATTRIBUTES OF WHICH EACH EXPRESSES ETERNAL AND INFINITE ESSENTIALITY NECESSARILY EXISTS PROOF IF THIS BE DENIED CONCEIVE IF POSSIBLE
WITH THE EMOTION OF ANOTHER AND SEE THAT ONE MAN IS MORE TROUBLED THAN ANOTHER BY THE SAME EMOTION OR WHEN WE ARE COMPARING THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS OF THE SAME MAN ONE WITH ANOTHER
BE SAID TO BE NATURALLY IN HARMONY PROOF THINGS WHICH ARE SAID TO BE IN HARMONY NATURALLY ARE UNDERSTOOD TO AGREE IN POWER
AND INVOLVES ABSOLUTE PERFECTION ALL CAUSE FOR DOUBT CONCERNING HIS EXISTENCE IS DONE AWAY AND THE UTMOST CERTAINTY ON THE QUESTION IS GIVEN THIS I THINK WILL BE EVIDENT TO EVERY MODERATELY ATTENTIVE READER
IS OTHER CONDITIONS BEING EQUAL STRONGER THAN DESIRE ARISING FROM PAIN PROOF DESIRE IS THE ESSENCE OF A MAN
THAT NO ONE IS SAID TO BE DECEIVED IN SO FAR AS HE PERCEIVES ANYTHING BUT ONLY IN SO FAR AS HE ASSENTS OR DISSENTS FOR INSTANCE HE WHO FEIGNS A WINGED HORSE
ASSUREDLY IT IS NOT LESS ABSURD TO ASSERT THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IS MADE UP OF BODIES OR PARTS THAN IT WOULD BE TO ASSERT THAT A SOLID IS MADE UP OF SURFACES A SURFACE OF LINES AND A LINE OF POINTS
WITHOUT THE IDEA OF A TRIANGLE THEREFORE
FOR AS THE POTENTIALITY OF EXISTENCE IS A POWER IT FOLLOWS THAT IN PROPORTION AS REALITY INCREASES IN THE NATURE OF A THING SO ALSO WILL IT INCREASE ITS STRENGTH FOR EXISTENCE
OF ALL SHOULD FORM AS IT WERE ONE SINGLE MIND AND ONE SINGLE BODY AND THAT ALL SHOULD WITH ONE CONSENT AS FAR AS THEY ARE ABLE ENDEAVOUR TO PRESERVE THEIR BEING AND ALL WITH ONE CONSENT SEEK WHAT IS USEFUL TO THEM ALL HENCE
AND THAT MEN MAY BE DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED BY ONE AND THE SAME OBJECT
THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THOSE WHO HAVE ASSERTED THAT GOD'S INTELLECT GOD'S WILL AND GOD'S POWER ARE ONE AND THE SAME AS THEREFORE GOD'S INTELLECT IS THE SOLE CAUSE OF THINGS NAMELY BOTH
COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IN SO FAR AS HE LOVES HIMSELF LOVES MAN AND CONSEQUENTLY
AND IT IS THE HEIGHT OF ABSURDITY TO PREDICATE SUCH A THING OF GOD A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE BUT MEANWHILE BY OTHER REASONS WITH WHICH THEY TRY TO PROVE THEIR POINT
THOSE WHICH INVOLVE THE NATURE BOTH OF THE HUMAN BODY AND OF EXTERNAL BODIES I SAY SECONDLY
I HAVE PROVED THE ETERNITY OF GOD IN ANOTHER MANNER WHICH I NEED NOT HERE REPEAT
FROM THE LATTER IT MUST FOLLOW EITHER THAT A TRIANGLE NECESSARILY EXISTS OR THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT SHOULD EXIST SO MUCH IS SELF EVIDENT
THE CAUSE FOR THEIR OPPOSITION LIES AS I HAVE SAID SOLELY IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ASSUMED TO DIFFER FOR WE ASSUME THAT PETER HAS THE IDEA OF THE LOVED OBJECT AS ALREADY IN HIS POSSESSION
PREFACE HUMAN INFIRMITY IN MODERATING AND CHECKING THE EMOTIONS I NAME BONDAGE FOR WHEN A MAN IS A PREY TO HIS EMOTIONS HE IS NOT HIS OWN MASTER BUT LIES AT THE MERCY OF FORTUNE
IT FOLLOWS THAT FROM THE NECESSITY OF ITS NATURE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT IS EVERYTHING WHICH CAN FALL WITHIN THE SPHERE OF AN INFINITE INTELLECT MUST NECESSARILY FOLLOW
CANNOT BE PRODUCED BY ANY EXTERNAL CAUSE THINGS WHICH ARE PRODUCED BY EXTERNAL CAUSES WHETHER THEY CONSIST OF MANY PARTS OR FEW OWE WHATSOEVER PERFECTION OR REALITY THEY POSSESS SOLELY TO THE EFFICACY OF THEIR EXTERNAL CAUSE
HE WILL ON THE OTHER HAND CALL IT PERFECT AS SOON AS HE SEES THAT IT IS CARRIED THROUGH TO THE END WHICH ITS AUTHOR HAD PURPOSED FOR IT BUT IF A MAN SEES A WORK THE LIKE WHEREOF HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND IF HE KNOWS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE ARTIFICER
SO IF WE SAY THAT A MAN AND A STONE ONLY AGREE IN THE FACT THAT BOTH ARE FINITE WANTING IN POWER NOT EXISTING BY THE NECESSITY OF THEIR OWN NATURE OR LASTLY INDEFINITELY SURPASSED BY THE POWER OF EXTERNAL CAUSES
AND FOLLOW AS I WILL SHORTLY SHOW FROM THE NECESSITY OF HIS ESSENCE WHEREFORE
WITHOUT GOD NOTHING CAN BE OR BE CONCEIVED
AS TO ITS ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE FOLLOWS FROM THE DIVINE NATURE AND CONSTANTLY DEPENDS ON GOD
AND ARE THOUGHT WORTHY OF BEING HATED BUT IN REALITY AVARICE AMBITION
HE WILL NECESSARILY REGARD THE HORSE AS PRESENT HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DOUBT OF ITS EXISTENCE ALTHOUGH HE BE NOT CERTAIN THEREOF WE HAVE DAILY EXPERIENCE OF SUCH A STATE OF THINGS IN DREAMS
FOR AS OBJECTS ARE SOME MORE EXCELLENT THAN OTHERS SO ALSO ARE THE IDEAS OF THEM SOME MORE EXCELLENT THAN OTHERS THIS ALSO SEEMS TO POINT TO A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UNDERSTANDING AND THE WILL
WHICH HAS HITHERTO BEEN REGARDED AS HIS MAIN SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE CARNIVORA THESE CARED NOTHING
I HAD NOT TIME TO EXPLORE IT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY BUT I MADE A MENTAL NOTE TO DO SO ON SOME FUTURE OCCASION AFTER A TWO HOURS JOURNEY FROM THE RIVER WE SAT PANTING ON THE SUMMIT AFTER OUR SCRAMBLE
BUT AFTER THIS MABRUKI KEPT CAREFULLY IN THE REAR CURIOUSLY ENOUGH ONLY A SHORT WHILE LATER WE HAD AN EXACTLY SIMILAR ADVENTURE WITH A RHINO AS OWING TO THE TORTUOUS NATURE OF THE PATH WE WALKED RIGHT INTO IT BEFORE WE WERE AWARE
AND HAD MADE OFF WITH A POOR WRETCH WHO WAS LYING THERE ASLEEP AFTER A NIGHT'S REST THEREFORE I TOOK UP MY POSITION IN A SUITABLE TREE NEAR THIS TENT
BUT THE UNFORTUNATE JEMADAR'S HEAD HAD BEEN LEFT INTACT SAVE FOR THE HOLES MADE BY THE LION'S TUSKS ON SEIZING HIM AND LAY A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE OTHER REMAINS THE EYES STARING WIDE OPEN WITH A STARTLED HORRIFIED LOOK IN THEM
AND MY FEELINGS MAY BE BETTER IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED
FORTUNATELY THERE WAS A VACANT IRON SHANTY CLOSE AT HAND WITH A CONVENIENT LOOPHOLE IN IT FOR FIRING FROM AND OUTSIDE THIS I PLACED THREE FULL GROWN GOATS AS BAIT
AND CONCEIVED A MOST UNFORTUNATE TASTE FOR OUR PORTERS
SEEMINGLY ALIVE AND CROUCHING FOR A SPRING ON LOOKING CLOSER HOWEVER I SATISFIED MYSELF THAT HE WAS REALLY AND TRULY STONE DEAD WHEREUPON MY FOLLOWERS CROWDED ROUND LAUGHED AND DANCED AND SHOUTED WITH JOY LIKE CHILDREN
WHEN I FANCIED I SAW SOMETHING MOVE A LITTLE WAY OFF AMONG THE LOW BUSHES
MAN OR BEAST WHEN REALLY DRIVEN BY HUNGER
SERIOUSLY HOWEVER MY CONTINUED ILL LUCK WAS MOST EXASPERATING AND THE RESULT WAS THAT THE INDIANS WERE MORE THAN EVER CONFIRMED IN THEIR BELIEF THAT THE LIONS WERE REALLY EVIL SPIRITS PROOF AGAINST MORTAL WEAPONS
RATHER FOOLISHLY I AT ONCE SCRAMBLED DOWN FROM THE TREE AND WALKED UP TOWARDS HIM
I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT ACCIDENTS OF THIS KIND ARE OF FAIRLY FREQUENT OCCURRENCE ALONG THE BANKS OF THESE RIVERS ON ONE OCCASION WHILE I WAS IN THE COUNTRY A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A VERY LUCKY ESCAPE
IT GAVE A FIERCE GROWL AND AT ONCE BOUNDED OFF THROUGH THE BUSH BUT TO MABRUKI WHO DOUBTLESS RECALLED THEN THE WARNING I HAD GIVEN HIM IN FUN EARLIER IN THE DAY
ON HEARING THIS DREADFUL STORY I AT ONCE SET OUT TO TRY TO TRACK THE ANIMAL AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY CAPTAIN HASLEM WHO HAPPENED TO BE STAYING AT TSAVO AT THE TIME AND WHO POOR FELLOW HIMSELF MET WITH A TRAGIC FATE VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS
I KEPT WATCH UNTIL ABOUT TWO A M WHEN I ROUSED MAHINA TO TAKE HIS TURN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR I SLEPT PEACEFULLY WITH MY BACK TO THE TREE
ONE OR TWO OF WHICH HE HAS KINDLY ALLOWED ME TO REPRODUCE IN THIS BOOK
AS IT HAPPENED THERE WAS NO SIGN OF OUR ENEMY FOR ABOUT TEN DAYS AFTER THIS AND WE BEGAN TO HOPE THAT HE HAD DIED OF HIS WOUNDS IN THE BUSH
I NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT THE INTRUDER WAS ONE OF THE DEMONS
AFTER PLAYING ME SO MANY EXASPERATING TRICKS HAD REALLY TURNED AT LAST I HAD SCARCELY TRACED THE BLOOD FOR MORE THAN A FEW PACES WHEN ON ROUNDING A BUSH
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I CONFIRMED MY OWN IDEA AS TO OUR WAY BY COMPARING MY WATCH AND THE SUN AND GAVE THE ORDER TO START AT ONCE
WE SAW NO SIGNS AND INDEED THE WHOLE REGION WAS SO DRY AND WATERLESS AS TO BE QUITE UNINHABITABLE THE ANIMALS THAT REQUIRE WATER HAVE TO MAKE A NIGHTLY JOURNEY TO AND FROM THE SABAKI
BUSH BUCK THE LESSER KUDU ZEBRA WART HOG BABOONS AND MONKEYS AND ANY NUMBER OF PAA THE LAST BEING OF A REDDER COLOUR THAN THOSE OF THE TSAVO VALLEY OF NATIVES OR OF HUMAN HABITATIONS HOWEVER
THERE WAS A RUSTLING AMONG THE BUSHES AND I SAW HIM STEALTHILY EMERGE INTO THE OPEN AND PASS ALMOST DIRECTLY BENEATH US I FIRED BOTH BARRELS PRACTICALLY TOGETHER INTO HIS SHOULDER AND TO MY JOY COULD SEE HIM GO DOWN UNDER THE FORCE OF THE BLOW
INSTANTLY HE SPRANG OUT AND MADE A MOST DETERMINED CHARGE DOWN ON US I FIRED AGAIN AND KNOCKED HIM OVER BUT IN A SECOND HE WAS UP ONCE MORE AND COMING FOR ME AS FAST AS HE COULD IN HIS CRIPPLED CONDITION A THIRD SHOT HAD NO APPARENT EFFECT
SO AS TO GET AT THE FRESH BLOOD I HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THEIR CUSTOM FROM THE APPEARANCE OF TWO HALF EATEN BODIES WHICH I SUBSEQUENTLY RESCUED THE SKIN WAS GONE IN PLACES AND THE FLESH LOOKED DRY
FOR A MOMENT I WAS SO TERRIFIED THAT I NEARLY FELL OFF THE PLANK
BUT INSTEAD OF SEIZING THE MAN HIMSELF IN HIS HURRY HE GRABBED A LARGE BAG OF RICE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE LYING IN THE TENT AND MADE OFF WITH IT DROPPING IT IN DISGUST SOME LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY WHEN HE REALISED HIS MISTAKE
HE MUST HAVE OBSERVED ME AS HE WAS OBLIVIOUS TO MY PRESENCE HOWEVER I LET HIM APPROACH TO WITHIN ABOUT FIFTEEN YARDS OF ME AND THEN COVERED HIM WITH MY RIFLE THE MOMENT I MOVED TO DO THIS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME AND SEEMED MUCH ASTONISHED AT MY SUDDEN APPEARANCE
I COULD BARELY MAKE OUT HIS FORM AS HE CROUCHED AMONG THE WHITISH UNDERGROWTH BUT I SAW ENOUGH FOR MY PURPOSE AND BEFORE HE COULD COME ANY NEARER I TOOK CAREFUL AIM AND PULLED THE TRIGGER THE SOUND OF THE SHOT WAS AT ONCE FOLLOWED BY A MOST TERRIFIC ROAR
THE CLIMB UP THE ESCARPMENT ITSELF WAS A STIFF ONE AND HAD TO BE NEGOTIATED PRINCIPALLY ON ALL FOURS BUT ON THE WAY UP I DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS CLEFT SOME MILES TO THE RIGHT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE AFFORDED AN EASIER ASCENT
I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE EVENTFUL SPOT AS I COULD NOT COMPLETELY PERSUADE MYSELF THAT EVEN YET THE DEVIL MIGHT NOT HAVE ELUDED ME IN SOME UNCANNY AND MYSTERIOUS WAY HAPPILY MY FEARS PROVED GROUNDLESS AND I WAS RELIEVED TO FIND THAT MY LUCK
I MAY MENTION THAT POISON WAS TRIED BUT WITHOUT EFFECT THE POISONED CARCASES OF TRANSPORT ANIMALS WHICH HAD DIED FROM THE BITE OF THE TSETSE FLY WERE PLACED IN LIKELY SPOTS BUT THE WILY MAN EATERS WOULD NOT TOUCH THEM AND MUCH PREFERRED LIVE MEN TO DEAD DONKEYS
IN DESPERATION AT THE THOUGHT OF HIS ESCAPING ME ONCE AGAIN I CREPT HURRIEDLY BACK TO THE CAMP SUMMONED THE AVAILABLE WORKMEN AND TOLD THEM TO BRING ALL THE TOM TOMS TIN CANS AND OTHER NOISY INSTRUMENTS OF ANY KIND THAT COULD BE FOUND
IN THE TROPICAL FOREST BOTH IN AMERICAN AND WEST CENTRAL AFRICA BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE OLD INHABITANTS OF EUROPE OR OF ASSYRIA OR ASIA MINOR EVER KILLED LIONS OR WOLVES BY THIS MEANS THEY LOOKED TO THE KING OR CHIEF OR SOME CHAMPION TO KILL THESE MONSTERS FOR THEM
SO THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE MASONRY OF THE BRIDGE WAS COMPLETED THE NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO SPAN THE SIXTY FOOT DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PIERS WITH IRON GIRDERS AS I HAD NEITHER WINCHES NOR SUFFICIENT BLOCKS AND TACKLE TO HAUL THESE OVER INTO POSITION
IT WAS VISITED BY LEOPARDS HYENAS WILD DOGS WILD CATS AND OTHER INHABITANTS OF THE JUNGLE AROUND US THESE ANIMALS DID A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE TO THE HERDS OF SHEEP AND GOATS WHICH WERE KEPT TO SUPPLY THE COMMISSARIAT
NO TIME WAS LOST IN LINKING UP THE PERMANENT WAY AND VERY SOON I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING THE FIRST TRAIN CROSS THE FINISHED WORK CURIOUSLY ENOUGH ONLY A DAY OR SO AFTER THE BRIDGE HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND THE INTERMEDIATE CRIBS CLEARED AWAY A TREMENDOUS RAIN STORM BROKE OVER THE COUNTRY
AT LAST THE LABOURERS ENTIRELY DECLINED TO GO ON UNLESS THEY WERE GUARDED BY AN IRON ENTRENCHMENT OF COURSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO WORK A RAILWAY UNDER THESE CONDITIONS AND UNTIL WE FOUND AN ENTHUSIASTIC SPORTSMAN TO GET RID OF THESE LIONS OUR ENTERPRISE WAS SERIOUSLY HINDERED
I HEARD THE BULLET STRIKE HIM BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT HAD NO KNOCKDOWN EFFECT
FOR SOME TIME WE HAD BEEN FOLLOWING A BROAD WHITE RHINO PATH AND THE GREAT FOOTMARKS OF ONE OF THESE BEASTS WERE FRESH AND PLAINLY VISIBLE IN THE DUST HE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO US
AND MADE OFF WITH GREAT LONG BOUNDS BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT HOWEVER I MANAGED TO HAVE THREE MORE SHOTS AT HIM FROM THE MAGAZINE RIFLE AND ANOTHER GROWL TOLD ME THAT THE LAST OF THESE HAD ALSO TAKEN EFFECT
AND WHICH WERE SECURED AT SUNDOWN IN A GRASS HUT AT ONE CORNER OF MY BOMA ONE PARTICULARLY DARK NIGHT WE WERE STARTLED BY A TREMENDOUS COMMOTION IN THIS SHED BUT AS THIS WAS BEFORE THE MAN EATERS WERE KILLED NO ONE DARED STIR OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE DISTURBANCE
THINKING THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY THE LION WOULD RETURN AS USUAL TO FINISH HIS MEAL I HAD A VERY STRONG SCAFFOLDING PUT UP A FEW FEET AWAY FROM THE DEAD GOATS AND TOOK UP MY POSITION ON IT BEFORE DARK ON THIS OCCASION I BROUGHT MY GUN BEARER MAHINA TO TAKE A TURN AT WATCHING
AND ON LOOKING OVER THE CREST I WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE TWO BEAUTIFUL GIRAFFE FEEDING PEACEFULLY A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY AND STRAINING THEIR LONG NECKS TO GET AT THE TOPS OF SOME MIMOSA LIKE TREES WHILE A YOUNG ONE WAS LYING DOWN IN THE GRASS QUITE CLOSE TO ME
AND BORE ME IN TRIUMPH SHOULDER HIGH ROUND THE DEAD BODY THESE THANKSGIVING CEREMONIES BEING OVER I EXAMINED THE BODY AND FOUND THAT TWO BULLETS HAD TAKEN EFFECT ONE CLOSE BEHIND THE LEFT SHOULDER EVIDENTLY PENETRATING THE HEART AND THE OTHER IN THE OFF HIND LEG
AS HOWEVER CAREFUL THE LATTER MAY BE A DEAD TWIG OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT IS SURE TO CRACKLE JUST AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT AND SO GIVE THE ALARM STILL I NEVER GAVE UP HOPE OF SOME DAY FINDING THEIR LAIR AND ACCORDINGLY CONTINUED TO DEVOTE
THEY ARE VARIOUSLY WROUGHT AND SOME OF THEM HAVING THE FORM OF MEN MUST HAVE BEEN IDOLS NEAR THE WALLS ARE MANY CAVES AND EXCAVATIONS UNDER THE EARTH BUT IN ANOTHER PLACE FARTHER WEST ARE OTHER AND GREATER MONUMENTS SUCH AS LARGE GATE WAYS WITH HINGES
AS EARLY AS FOUR THOUSAND OR FIVE THOUSAND B C THE FOURTH DYNASTY OF THE EGYPTIANS ACCORDING TO BRUGSCH DATES FROM ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED B C AT THIS TIME THE IBERIANS HAD BECOME SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL TO ATTEMPT THE CONQUEST OF THE KNOWN WORLD
AMONG THEIR SCULPTURES IN OHIO WE FIND ACCURATE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE LAMANTINE MANATEE OR SEA COW FOUND TO DAY ON THE SHORES OF FLORIDA BRAZIL AND CENTRAL AMERICA AND OF THE TOUCAN A TROPICAL AND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY SOUTH AMERICAN BIRD
TILL THE SPACE AT THE HIGHEST COURSE BECOMES SO NARROW THAT A SINGLE STONE COVERS IT
THERE WAS ALSO A GENERAL LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY CONGRESS OR PARLIAMENT HELD EVERY EIGHTY DAYS PRESIDED OVER BY THE KING CONSISTING OF ALL THE JUDGES OF THE REALM TO WHICH THE LAST APPEAL LAY
THE CONSTANT CRY OF THE MOURNERS AS THE FUNERAL PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD WAS TO THE WEST TO THE WEST THIS UNDER WORLD WAS BEYOND THE WATER HENCE THE FUNERAL PROCESSION ALWAYS CROSSED A BODY OF WATER WHERE THE TOMBS WERE AS IN MOST CASES
IBID THE IBERIANS KNOWN AS SICANES COLONIZED SICILY IN THE ANCIENT DAYS THEY WERE THE ORIGINAL SETTLERS IN ITALY AND SARDINIA THEY ARE PROBABLY THE SOURCE OF THE DARK HAIRED STOCK IN NORWAY AND SWEDEN
HEBREWS AND CUSHITES BUT BEYOND THIS THE LIGHT FAILS US
AND EVEN AUBURN HAIR THEY HAD REGULAR FEATURES LARGE HEADS AND LARGE BODIES THEIR DESCENDANTS ARE TO THIS DAY AN OLIVE SKINNED PEOPLE MUCH LIGHTER IN COLOR THAN THE INDIAN TRIBES SUBJUGATED BY THEM THEY WERE A GREAT RACE
PRESENTING AN UNBROKEN METALLIC LUSTRE THE OVERLAPPING EDGES SO WELL POLISHED AS TO BE SCARCELY DISCOVERABLE BEADS AND STARS MADE OF SHELLS HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN FOUND DOUBLY PLATED FIRST WITH COPPER THEN WITH SILVER
THE TOLTECS WERE FAIR ROBUST AND BEARDED I HAVE OFTEN SEEN INDIANS OF PURE BLOOD WITH BLUE EYES
WHILE IN THE ARCHAIC HEBREW WE HAVE THE SAME CRESCENT FIGURE
HOLD STRONGLY TO THEIR IDEAS AND USAGES ARE PERSEVERING AND MELANCHOLIC IN A WORD BOTH IN MORALE AND PHYSIQUE THEY PRESENT THE TYPE OF A SOUTHERN RACE OF THE ATLANTEANS
AT HOPETOWN OHIO ARE TWO WALLED FIGURES ONE A SQUARE THE OTHER A CIRCLE EACH CONTAINING PRECISELY TWENTY ACRES
AND MEANS PRIMITIVE CHIEF AND MANCO
RUINS WHICH AT FIRST MAKE NO IMPRESSION SO COMPLETE IS THEIR DILAPIDATION HE ASSERTS THE GREAT ANTIQUITY OF THESE RUINS BECAUSE HE FOUND THE VERY HIGHWAYS OF THE ANCIENT CITY TO BE COMPOSED OF BROKEN BRICKS AND POTTERY THE DEBRIS LEFT BY EARLIER POPULATIONS
IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE AFTER HAVING SEEN IT IN THE REALITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF SO MANY BUILDINGS COLLECTED ON A SINGLE POINT IN THEIR DIMENSIONS IN THE RESOLUTE PERSEVERANCE WHICH THEIR CONSTRUCTION REQUIRED
THE AGGLUTINATIVE IN WHICH ONE ROOT IS FASTENED ON TO ANOTHER AND A WORD IS FORMED IN WHICH THE CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENTS ARE OBVIOUSLY DISTINCT OR THE INFLEXIONAL WHERE THE AUXILIARY ROOTS GET WORN DOWN AND ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE BY THE PHILOLOGIST
NOW WE TURN TO THE ANCIENT ETHIOPIAN SIGN FOR K KA
THE TABLE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH SUBSTANTIAL MEATS ESPECIALLY GAME AMONG WHICH THE MOST CONSPICUOUS WAS THE TURKEY ALSO THERE WERE FOUND VERY DELICIOUS VEGETABLES AND FRUITS OF EVERY VARIETY NATIVE TO THE CONTINENT
HUAKIA TO CALL
MISOR GAVE BIRTH TO TAAUT THE GOD OF LETTERS THE INVENTOR OF THE ALPHABET AND TAAUT BECAME THOTH THE GOD OF HISTORY OF THE EGYPTIANS
A RUDE ARTICLE IN THE SHAPE OF AN AXE COMPOSED OF PURE LEAD WEIGHING ABOUT HALF A POUND WAS FOUND IN SINKING A WELL WITHIN THE TRENCH OF THE ANCIENT WORKS AT CIRCLEVILLE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT IT WAS THE PRODUCTION OF THE MOUND BUILDERS AS GALENA HAS OFTEN BEEN FOUND ON THE ALTARS IN THE MOUNDS
THEIR CIRCULAR MOUNDS ARE FOUND IN MINNESOTA AND IOWA AND SOME VERY LARGE ONES IN DAKOTA ILLINOIS AND INDIANA WERE DENSELY POPULATED BY THEM IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE VITAL CENTRE OF THEIR COLONIES WAS NEAR THE JUNCTION OF THE OHIO AND MISSISSIPPI RIVERS
THEN LEPSIUS FOUND THE HIEROGLYPHIC SIGN OF THE PAPYRUS ROLL ON MONUMENTS OF THE TWELFTH DYNASTY AFTERWARD HE FOUND THE SAME SIGN ON MONUMENTS OF THE FOURTH DYNASTY WHICH IS GETTING BACK PRETTY CLOSE TO MENES THE PROTOMONARCH AND INDEED LITTLE DOUBT IS ENTERTAINED
OR MO IT IS PROBABLY THE LATTER AND IN IT WE HAVE THE CIRCLE DETACHED FROM THE HIEROGLYPH WE FIND THE PRECISE MAYA O A CIRCLE IN A CIRCLE OR A DOT WITHIN A
THIRTEEN THEY USED SEDAN CHAIRS FOURTEEN THEY REGARDED AGRICULTURE AS THE PRINCIPAL INTEREST OF THE NATION AND HELD GREAT AGRICULTURAL FAIRS AND FESTIVALS FOR THE INTERCHANGE OF THE PRODUCTIONS OF THE FARMERS
THE RITES OF MARRIAGE SAYS PRESCOTT WERE CELEBRATED WITH AS MUCH FORMALITY AS IN ANY CHRISTIAN COUNTRY AND THE INSTITUTION WAS HELD IN SUCH REVERENCE THAT A TRIBUNAL WAS INSTITUTED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING QUESTIONS RELATING TO IT
THE NATION THAT BECAME MISTRESS OF THE SEAS ESTABLISHED COMMUNICATION WITH EVERY SHORE AND MONOPOLIZED THE COMMERCE OF THE KNOWN WORLD MUST HAVE SUBSTITUTED A PHONETIC ALPHABET FOR THE HIEROGLYPHICS
IN A FOSSIL STATE INDICATING AN IMMENSE ANTIQUITY THE TOLTECS POSSESSED A PURE AND SIMPLE RELIGION LIKE THAT OF ATLANTIS AS DESCRIBED BY PLATO WITH THE SAME SACRIFICES OF FRUITS AND FLOWERS THEY WERE FARMERS THEY RAISED AND WOVE COTTON
NOW WHAT IS THE PECULIARITY OF THIS HIEROGLYPH THE CIRCLE BELOW IS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THERE ARE MANY CIRCULAR FIGURES IN THE MAYA ALPHABET CLEARLY IF ONE WAS CALLED UPON TO SIMPLIFY THIS HE WOULD RETAIN THE TWO SMALL CIRCLES JOINED SIDE BY SIDE
THEY MADE KNOWN THE WORSHIP OF THIS GOD TO OTHER NATIONS TO THE EGYPTIANS FOR EXAMPLE IN OTHER WORDS THE ATLANTEANS WERE THE FIRST KNOWN NAVIGATORS LIKE ALL NAVIGATORS THEY MUST HAVE PLANTED COLONIES AT A DISTANCE
BY MIXING ONE PART OF TIN WITH NINE PARTS OF COPPER OR WHICH IS MORE PROBABLE THE MANUFACTURES OF THE MOUND BUILDERS MAY HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE SPOT AND AS THEY HAD NO TIN WITHIN THEIR TERRITORY THEY USED COPPER ALONE EXCEPT IT MAY BE FOR SUCH TOOLS AS WERE NEEDED TO CARVE STONE AND THESE PERHAPS WERE HARDENED WITH TIN
F OCCURS IN THE SAME PLACE ALSO ON THE IDALIAN TABLET OF CYPRUS IN LYCIAN ALSO IN TUARIK BERBER AND SOME OTHER WRITINGS AMERICAN CYCLOPAEDIA
AS IN OUR WORDS CITRON CIRCLE CIVIL CIRCUS ET CETERA AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE MAYA ALPHABET CA AND NOT K IT EVIDENTLY REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT SOUND
A STANI MEANS I CHANGE A THING'S PLACE FOR NI OR MI IS THE FIRST PERSON SINGULAR AND ADDED TO THE ROOT OF A VERB IS THE SIGN OF THE FIRST PERSON OF THE PRESENT INDICATIVE FOR INSTANCE
THE BOWLS OF MOST OF THE STONE PIPES ARE CARVED IN MINIATURE FIGURES OF ANIMALS BIRDS REPTILES ET CETERA ALL OF THEM ARE EXECUTED WITH STRICT FIDELITY TO NATURE AND WITH EXQUISITE SKILL NOT ONLY ARE THE FEATURES OF THE OBJECTS FAITHFULLY REPRESENTED
SO THAT THE SPACE ENCLOSED BY EACH MIGHT EXACTLY CORRESPOND
THE FIRST HERMES HERE REFERRED TO AFTERWARD CALLED MERCURY BY THE ROMANS WAS A SON OF ZEUS AND MAIA A DAUGHTER OF ATLAS THIS IS THE SAME MAIA WHOM THE ABBE BRASSEUR DE BOURBOURG IDENTIFIES
THIS DOES NOT LOOK MUCH LIKE OUR LETTER K BUT LET US EXAMINE IT FOLLOWING THE PRECEDENT
AND THE ILLYRIAN S
WHO ARE CELTS OF TALL STATURE WITH BLUE EYES WHITE SKINS AND BLOND HAIR THEY ARE COMMUNICATIVE IMPETUOUS VERSATILE THEY PASS RAPIDLY FROM COURAGE TO DESPAIR THE BRETONS ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THEY ARE TACITURN
THE LETTERS THEN WHICH WE OWE TO THE PHOENICIANS ARE A B C D E H I K L M N O
TEN THEIR WEAPONS WERE THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE OLD WORLD AND MADE AFTER THE SAME PATTERN ELEVEN THEY DRANK TOASTS AND INVOKED BLESSINGS TWELVE THEY BUILT TRIUMPHAL ARCHES FOR THEIR RETURNING HEROES AND STREWED THE ROAD BEFORE THEM WITH LEAVES AND FLOWERS
THE BRETON OF PURE BLOOD HAS A LONG HEAD LIGHT YELLOW COMPLEXION OF BISTRE TINGE EYES BLACK OR BROWN STATURE SHORT AND THE BLACK HAIR OF THE CABYLE LIKE HIM HE INSTINCTIVELY HATES STRANGERS IN BOTH ARE THE SAME PERVERSENESS AND OBSTINACY
WHO CLAIM THAT THEIR CIVILIZATION CAME TO THEM ACROSS THE SEA IN SHIPS FROM THE EAST THAT IS FROM THE DIRECTION OF ATLANTIS THE MAYAS SUCCEEDED TO THE COLHUAS WHOSE ERA TERMINATED ONE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF CHRIST
IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM CERTAIN ANIMALS WERE DOMESTICATED BY THE ABORIGINES FROM SO REMOTE A PERIOD THAT SCARCELY ANY OF THEIR SPECIES AS IN THE CASE OF THE LAMA OF PERU WERE TO BE FOUND IN A STATE OF UNRESTRAINED FREEDOM AT THE ADVENT OF THE SPANIARDS
THE CATHEDRAL OF NOTRE DAME AT PARIS COULD BE SET INSIDE ONE OF THE HALLS OF KARNAC AND NOT TOUCH THE WALLS THE WHOLE VALLEY AND DELTA OF THE NILE FROM THE CATACOMBS TO THE SEA WAS COVERED WITH TEMPLES PALACES TOMBS PYRAMIDS AND PILLARS
ON THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY INDICATED TO REDUCE THIS TO ITS ELEMENTS WE WOULD USE A FIGURE LIKE THIS
SOME CHARACTERISTIC MARK WITH WHICH THEY REPRESENTED THE WHOLE FIGURE NOW LET US APPLY THIS RULE WE HAVE SEEN IN THE TABLE OF ALPHABETS THAT IN EVERY LANGUAGE FROM OUR OWN DAY TO THE TIME OF THE PHOENICIANS O HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY A CIRCLE
WITH THE MAYA OF CENTRAL AMERICA SIR WILLIAM DRUMMOND IN HIS ORIGINES SAID THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY OF ACCOUNTING EITHER FOR THE EARLY USE OF LETTERS AMONG SO MANY DIFFERENT NATIONS
COLUMBUS FOUND THE NATIVES MAKING SUCH VOYAGES IN OPEN CANOES IF THEN WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS NO ORIGINAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INHABITANTS OF THE MAIN LAND AND OF ATLANTIS THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY OF THE ATLANTEANS WOULD SOON REVEAL TO THEM THE SHORES OF THE GULF
IN SOME CASES THE PEDIGREE IS SO PLAIN AS TO BE INDISPUTABLE
THE BUILDINGS HERE AS THROUGHOUT PERU WERE ALL CONSTRUCTED OF HEWN STONE AND HAD DOORS AND WINDOWS WITH POSTS SILLS AND THRESHOLDS OF STONE AT CUELAP IN NORTHERN PERU REMARKABLE RUINS WERE FOUND
AND BERNARD REFUSING ANY ENCOURAGEMENT OF THAT HOPE THE VERY ROOTS OF FAITH ARE DEAD IN HIM FOR EVER
A THING IN FACT NATURALLY DISTRESSING TO THE SCHOLAR WHO WILL THEREFORE EVER BE SHY OF OFFERING UNCOMPLIMENTARY ASSISTANCE TO THE READER'S WIT
SO ONLY EACH WORD OR SYLLABLE BE NOT OF FALSE COLOUR TO CHANGE MY ILLUSTRATION A LITTLE WELL THAT IS BECAUSE ANY WRITER WORTH TRANSLATING AT ALL HAS WINNOWED AND SEARCHED THROUGH HIS VOCABULARY
A CURIOSITY ABOUT EVERYTHING WHATEVER AS IT REALLY IS INVOLVING A CERTAIN HUMILITY OF ATTITUDE COGNATE TO WHAT MUST AFTER ALL BE THE LESS AMBITIOUS FORM OF LITERATURE
IF I MUST NEEDS SUFFER THE INCONSOLABLE MISFORTUNE OF RENOUNCING THE HAPPINESS I HAD HOPED FOR ARE YOU QUITE SURE THAT THE MAN TO WHOM ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU WILL GIVE YOUR NIECE MAY NOT BE SOMETHING MORE THAN A SCEPTIC OR EVEN AN ATHEIST
IN A LIBERAL NATURALISATION OF THE IDEAS OF SCIENCE TOO FOR AFTER ALL THE CHIEF STIMULUS OF GOOD STYLE IS TO POSSESS A FULL RICH COMPLEX MATTER TO GRAPPLE WITH THE LITERARY ARTIST THEREFORE
HIS PECULIAR INTUITION OF A WORLD PROSPECTIVE OR DISCERNED BELOW THE FAULTY CONDITIONS OF THE PRESENT
BUT IN MEASURE FOR MEASURE QUITE CERTAINLY SHAKESPEARE HAS DIRECTED THE ATTENTION OF SYMPATHETIC READERS ALONG CERTAIN CHANNELS OF MEDITATION BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE SCOPE OF HIS WORK MEASURE FOR MEASURE THEREFORE
I AM NOT USUALLY SO VERY TALKATIVE IT IS BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS IN QUESTION AND I SHOULD WISH HIS MEMORY TO BE AS DEAR AND AS VENERABLE TO ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD AS IT IS TO ME
IS THE PLEASANTEST OF MANY GLIMPSES WE GET HERE OF PLEASANT PLACES THE FIELD WITHOUT THE TOWN ANGELO'S GARDEN HOUSE THE CONSECRATED FOUNTAIN
YET IT IS HARDLY LESS FULL OF WHAT IS REALLY TRAGIC IN MAN'S EXISTENCE THAN IF CLAUDIO HAD INDEED STOOPED TO DEATH EVEN THE HUMOROUS CONCLUDING SCENES HAVE TRAITS OF SPECIAL GRACE
ROUGH AND DISJOINTED INDEED BUT FORCED TO YIELD IN PLACES ITS PROFOUNDER MEANING IN MEASURE FOR MEASURE IN CONTRAST WITH THE FLAWLESS EXECUTION OF ROMEO AND JULIET
IN THE JUST SPACING OUT OF WORD TO THOUGHT IN THE LOGICALLY FILLED SPACE CONNECTED ALWAYS WITH THE DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF DIFFICULTY OVERCOME DIFFERENT CLASSES OF PERSONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES MAKE OF COURSE VERY VARIOUS DEMANDS UPON LITERATURE
TO BE WORTH ETCHING OFF DAY BY DAY BY AN OBSERVER WELL INFORMED ON THE SUBJECT RECOGNISING IN HIMSELF THOUGH AS HIS ONE REAL FAULT THAT HE CAN TAKE NOTHING SERIOUSLY IN HEAVEN OR EARTH BERNARD DE VAUDRICOURT
THE LOOK OF YOUR HOUSE ITS STYLE ITS TONE AND KEEPING CARRIED ME TWO CENTURIES BACK SO COMPLETELY THAT I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
THE DUKE'S QUAINT BUT EXCELLENT MORALISING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT DOES BUT EXPRESS LIKE THE CHORUS OF A GREEK PLAY THE SPIRIT OF THE PASSING INCIDENTS TO HIM IN SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY
SURPLUSAGE HE WILL DREAD THAT AS THE RUNNER ON HIS MUSCLES FOR IN TRUTH ALL ART DOES BUT CONSIST IN THE REMOVAL OF SURPLUSAGE FROM THE LAST FINISH OF THE GEM ENGRAVER BLOWING AWAY THE LAST PARTICLE OF INVISIBLE DUST
BUT THE TRUE ARTIST ALLOWS FOR IT HE WILL REMEMBER THAT AS THE VERY WORD ORNAMENT INDICATES WHAT IS IN ITSELF NON ESSENTIAL
AND IT IS THE BUSINESS OF CRITICISM TO ESTIMATE THEM AS SUCH AS IT IS GOOD IN THE CRITICISM OF VERSE TO LOOK FOR THOSE HARD LOGICAL AND QUASI PROSAIC EXCELLENCES WHICH THAT TOO HAS OR NEEDS
WHERE AFTER ALL WE MUST NEEDS MAKE THE MOST OF THINGS CRITICAL EFFORTS TO LIMIT ART A PRIORI BY ANTICIPATIONS REGARDING THE NATURAL INCAPACITY OF THE MATERIAL WITH WHICH THIS OR THAT ARTIST WORKS AS THE SCULPTOR WITH SOLID FORM
BEHIND IT OF PERHAPS QUITE ALIEN ASSOCIATIONS JUST THERE IT MAY BE
BELOW THE SURFACE ITS TROUBLES ITS DISORDERS
WITH MILTON AND TAYLOR IT WILL BE USELESS TO PROTEST THAT IT CAN BE NOTHING AT ALL EXCEPT SOMETHING VERY TAMELY AND NARROWLY CONFINED TO MAINLY PRACTICAL ENDS
MUSICAL WITH CICERO AND NEWMAN
HE KNOWS THE NARCOTIC FORCE OF THESE UPON THE NEGLIGENT INTELLIGENCE TO WHICH ANY DIVERSION LITERALLY IS WELCOME ANY VAGRANT INTRUDER BECAUSE ONE CAN GO WANDERING AWAY WITH IT FROM THE IMMEDIATE SUBJECT JEALOUS
THAT MIGHT SEEM A SHADE TOO SERIOUS FOR LIPS SO YOUTHFUL MY FATHER SHE PROCEEDED DIED OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A WOUND HE HAD RECEIVED AT PATAY THAT MAY SHOW YOU THAT HE LOVED HIS COUNTRY BUT HE WAS NO LOVER OF HIS OWN AGE
AS FOR ME
ARE ALWAYS LIABLE TO BE DISCREDITED BY THE FACTS OF ARTISTIC PRODUCTION AND WHILE PROSE IS ACTUALLY FOUND TO BE A COLOURED THING WITH BACON
SHE PAUSED WITH A LITTLE CONFUSION AS I THOUGHT AT THE WARMTH OF HER LAST WORDS
TO BECOME TUTOR TO THE IGNORANCE OF THE FIRST I MEET IS A THING I ABHOR
HE BECOMES AN ARTIST HIS WORK FINE ART AND GOOD ART AS I HOPE ULTIMATELY TO SHOW IN PROPORTION TO THE TRUTH OF HIS PRESENTMENT OF THAT SENSE AS IN THOSE HUMBLER OR PLAINER FUNCTIONS OF LITERATURE ALSO
IN A COMPOSITION UTTERLY UNADORNED WITH HARDLY A SINGLE SUGGESTION OF VISIBLY BEAUTIFUL THINGS PARALLEL ALLUSION THE ALLUSIVE WAY GENERALLY THE FLOWERS IN THE GARDEN
I MAY TELL YOU WITH TRUTH THAT THE DAY ON WHICH I PERCEIVED MY FAITH COME TO NOUGHT THE DAY ON WHICH I LOST HOPE IN GOD I SHED THE BITTEREST TEARS OF MY LIFE IN SPITE OF APPEARANCES I AM NOT SO LIGHT A SPIRIT AS PEOPLE THINK
TO REALLY STRENUOUS MINDS THERE IS A PLEASURABLE STIMULUS IN THE CHALLENGE FOR A CONTINUOUS EFFORT ON THEIR PART TO BE REWARDED BY SECURER AND MORE INTIMATE GRASP OF THE AUTHOR'S SENSE SELF RESTRAINT A SKILFUL ECONOMY OF MEANS
AS IF IT WERE INDEED A THING OF ORDINARY EXISTENCE
ROSE MALLOWS IMMORTELLES ROSE PINKS IN SHORT WHAT PEOPLE CALL PARSONAGE FLOWERS
HIS SENSE OF PROSAIC EXCELLENCE AFFECTED HIS VERSE RATHER THAN HIS PROSE WHICH IS NOT ONLY FERVID RICHLY FIGURED POETIC AS WE SAY BUT VITIATED ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY BY MANY A SCANNING LINE
CONSIDERATELY THOUGH WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR HIM OVER THE GROUND WHICH THE FEMALE CONSCIENCE TRAVERSES SO LIGHTLY SO AMIABLY FOR THE MATERIAL IN WHICH HE WORKS IS NO MORE A CREATION OF HIS OWN THAN THE SCULPTOR'S MARBLE
IN THE HABITUAL AND SUMMARY RECOGNITION OF WHICH SCHOLARSHIP CONSISTS A WRITER FULL OF A MATTER HE IS BEFORE ALL THINGS ANXIOUS TO EXPRESS MAY THINK OF THOSE LAWS THE LIMITATIONS OF VOCABULARY STRUCTURE AND THE LIKE AS A RESTRICTION
AND OF A TRUE DIGNITY IN DANGER GIVING EACH OTHER A SYMPATHETIC IF TRANSITORY REGRET ONE SORRY THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE FOOLISHLY LOST AT A GAME OF TICK TACK
A MAN OF HONOUR YES I BELIEVE IT THEN AFTER AN INTERVAL COME MONSIEUR HE SAID GENTLY YOUR CASE IS NOT AS DESPERATE AS YOU SUPPOSE MY ALIETTE IS ONE OF THOSE YOUNG ENTHUSIASTS THROUGH WHOM HEAVEN SOMETIMES WORKS MIRACLES
IN THIS LATE DAY CERTAINLY NO CRITICAL PROCESS CAN BE CONDUCTED REASONABLY WITHOUT ECLECTICISM
THE MOATED GRANGE WITH ITS DEJECTED MISTRESS ITS LONG LISTLESS DISCONTENTED DAYS WHERE WE HEAR ONLY THE VOICE OF A BOY BROKEN OFF SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF ONE OF THE LOVELIEST SONGS OF SHAKESPEARE OR OF SHAKESPEARE'S SCHOOL
WHICH CONDITIONS MAY ALSO CONTAIN IN THEM THE SECRET OF THE PROPER DISCRIMINATION AND GUARDIANSHIP OF THE PECULIAR EXCELLENCES OF EITHER THE LINE BETWEEN FACT AND SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM EXTERNAL FACT IS INDEED HARD TO DRAW
PRESCRIBING THE REJECTION OF MANY A NEOLOGY MANY A LICENSE MANY A GIPSY PHRASE WHICH MIGHT PRESENT ITSELF AS ACTUALLY EXPRESSIVE HIS APPEAL AGAIN IS TO THE SCHOLAR WHO HAS GREAT EXPERIENCE IN LITERATURE
WITHOUT PRINCIPLES WITH NO OUTLOOK BEYOND THIS WORLD AND YET WHAT CAN ONE DO YOU WOULD TELL ME FORTHWITH IN THE GOODNESS THE COMPASSION WHICH I READ IN YOUR EYES CONFIDE TO ME YOUR OBJECTIONS TO RELIGION AND I WILL TRY TO SOLVE THEM
STIMULATED TO READ MORE CAREFULLY BY SHAKESPEARE'S OWN PROFOUNDER TOUCHES THE READER WILL NOTE THE VIVID REALITY THE SUBTLE INTERCHANGE OF LIGHT AND SHADE
TO QUIET ALL POSSIBLE SUSPICION OF A TRAP AND HIS INSPECTION OF THE PRISONER'S PERSON LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT THIS RESULT HAD BEEN ATTAINED NOW SAID HE YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR ATTENTION
WHICH RAN AFTER YOU THE GIRL WHO WAS NEATLY DRESSED THE ONE WHO THE DRIVER SUDDENLY PAUSED SOME VIVID REMEMBRANCE PASSED THROUGH HIS BRAIN AND ABRUPTLY JERKING THE RAINS
WOULD HAVE CONFESSED IT LONG AGO BUT SIR THIS MAN IS SURELY NOT THE BUFFOON MAY REPLIED THE YOUNG DETECTIVE NO CERTAINLY NOT
THE CLERK AT ONCE DIPPED HIS PEN IN THE INK AND TURNING TO THE PRISONER HE ASKED WHAT IS YOUR NAME MAY YOUR CHRISTIAN NAME I HAVE NONE
AND HE HAD MANAGED TO DECEIVE THE MOST EXPERIENCED EYES IN PARIS THE YOUNG DETECTIVE HAD WAITED DURING NEARLY THREE HOURS AS MOTIONLESS AS THE BENCH ON WHICH HE WAS SEATED AND SO ABSORBED IN STUDYING HIS CASE THAT HE HAD THOUGHT NEITHER OF THE COLD
WAS CONNIVING WITH THE MURDERER THE MOTIVE OF HER CONNIVANCE WAS YET UNKNOWN
BUT THEY WERE HURRYING AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD IN WHAT DIRECTION OH THEY WERE RUNNING TOWARD THE RUE DE VARENNES
REMARKED LECOQ YES BUT SHE WON'T THE YOUNG DETECTIVE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDENTLY SUCH WAS HIS OWN OPINION HE DID NOT DELUDE HIMSELF WITH FALSE HOPES
THE PRISONER IS KILLING HIMSELF A DOZEN KEEPERS HASTENED TO THE SPOT THE DOOR WAS QUICKLY OPENED AND IT WAS THEN ASCERTAINED THAT THE PRISONER HAVING TORN A STRIP OF BINDING FROM HIS CLOTHES HAD FASTENED IT ROUND HIS NECK AND TRIED TO STRANGLE HIMSELF
EVIDENCE WILL CRUSH THE MOST OBSTINATE MAN HE GIVES UP THE STRUGGLE AND CONFESSES NOW A WOMAN SCOFFS AT EVIDENCE SHOW HER THE SUN TELL HER IT'S DAYTIME AT ONCE SHE WILL CLOSE HER EYES AND SAY TO YOU
WHO SANG AND YELLED HER IMPRECATIONS ALTERNATELY IT IS NEEDLESS HOWEVER TO RECAPITULATE HER OATHS LET US RATHER FOLLOW THE TRAIN OF LECOQ'S MEDITATION BY WHAT MEANS COULD HE SECURE SOME CLUE TO THE MURDERER'S IDENTITY
YOU SAY YOU HAVE LIVED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES HE INQUIRED
AND I MUST GET THE PRISONER OTHER CLOTHING AS THE THINGS HE IS WEARING NOW WILL BE USED AS EVIDENCE LET SOME ONE GO AT ONCE AND TELL THE SUPERINTENDENT THAT THE OTHER OCCUPANTS OF THE VAN MUST WAIT AT THIS MOMENT THE GOVERNOR OF THE DEPOT ENTERED THE OFFICE
HAS HE CONFESSED HIS GUILT TO THE MAGISTRATE OR
AND DEPENDENT ON THE CUSTOMERS IT BROUGHT THEM BEING OF A CONSCIENTIOUS TURN OF MIND HE ENTERED EACH ESTABLISHMENT IN SUCCESSION AND MEETING NOW AND AGAIN VARIOUS ACQUAINTANCES HE FELT COMPELLED TO PROFFER AND ACCEPT
AND TO OBTAIN IT TO FIND IT HE DECIDED TO RUN THIS TERRIBLE RISK AND TO THINK THAT IT WAS MY FAULT MY FAULT ALONE THAT THIS CONVINCING PROOF ESCAPED US AND I THOUGHT MYSELF SO SHREWD
NOW RESUMED THE CLERK WILL YOU ANSWER BUT THE GOVERNOR PERCEIVED THE FUTILITY OF FURTHER QUESTIONING AND SILENCING THE CLERK BY A GESTURE HE TOLD THE PRISONER TO TAKE OFF HIS BOOTS LECOQ THOUGHT THE ASSASSIN'S GLANCE WAVERED AS HE HEARD THIS ORDER
READ THE LAST REMARK YOU TOOK DOWN IN A MONOTONOUS VOICE THE SMILING CLERK REPEATED I SHOULD LIKE TO KILL THE PERSON WHO DARED TO SAY THAT I KNEW LACHENEUR
AUDACIOUS COOL HEADED FELLOW WHILE WE WERE TRACKING HIS FOOTPRINTS HE WAS WATCHING US WHEN WE HAD GOT TO SOME DISTANCE HE WAS BOLD ENOUGH TO ENTER THE HOVEL
NO MURMURED LECOQ NO THIS MAN IS NOT WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE SO SAYING HE ENTERED THE CELL THE CULPRIT RAISED HIS HEAD GAVE THE DETECTIVE AN INDIFFERENT GLANCE BUT DID NOT UTTER A WORD WELL HOW GOES IT
UNEQUALED IN THE WORLD FOR THEIR FEATS UPON THE TRAPEZE AND THE TIGHT ROPE AND IN INNUMERABLE OTHER EXERCISES OF GRACE SUPPLENESS AND STRENGTH THAT IS SUFFICIENT INTERRUPTED THE MAGISTRATE
NOT BEFORE THE CLEVEREST HE HAD CERTAINLY OVERWHELMED THE OLD VETERAN BY HIS SUPERIORITY HE HAD LITERALLY CRUSHED HIM BUT WHAT GREAT MERIT WHAT WONDERFUL VICTORY WAS THIS
WHO WERE THESE FIVE PERSONS OH OH SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED LECOQ IN TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TONES THEN THE TWO WOMEN COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WITH THE MURDERER
THE VEHICLE WAS NOW ROLLING ALONG THE RUE DE BOURGOGNE HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET THE DRIVER PULLED UP AND TURNING TO LECOQ EXCLAIMED HERE WE ARE THAT'S THE HOUSE THE HUSSIES WENT INTO
DRAINED IT SLOWLY AND REMARKED THAT'S CAPITAL THERE CAN BE NOTHING TO BEAT THAT
ALMOST CONVINCED ME EVEN AGAINST MY REASON DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR VERY APPROPRIATE CRITICISM PROVES INQUIRED THE MAGISTRATE I AM LISTENING SIR AH WELL
YOU SEE THAT GEVROL ALREADY SPEAKS ILL OF ME HE IS JEALOUS AH WELL WHAT DOES THAT MATTER TO YOU IF YOU SUCCEED YOU WILL HAVE YOUR REVENGE IF YOU ARE MISTAKEN THEN I AM MISTAKEN TOO
A FOOTPRINT THAT BORE A CLOSE RESEMBLANCE TO THOSE LEFT BY THE MAN WHO HAD ENTERED THE GARDEN THEY COMPARED THE IMPRESSIONS AND RECOGNIZED THE SAME DESIGNS FORMED BY THE NAILS UPON THE SOLE OF THE BOOT IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE ACCOMPLICE
SHARED GEVROL'S OPINION LECOQ STOOD ALONE HE DID NOT DISCUSS THE MATTER WHAT GOOD WOULD IT HAVE DONE BESIDES THE WIDOW CHUPIN WAS JUST BEING BROUGHT IN THE JOURNEY MUST HAVE CALMED HER NERVES FOR SHE HAD BECOME AS GENTLE AS A LAMB
BEING TO ALL APPEARANCES SUBLIMELY INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING PASSING AROUND HIM TO THE MAGISTRATE'S PROPOSAL HE CARELESSLY NODDED ASSENT WAS THAT YOUR WIFE WHO CAME IN JUST NOW
AND HE PAUSED IN HIS PROMENADE AH WELL HE INQUIRED WHAT NEWS DO YOU BRING I HAVE AN ORDER TO CONDUCT THE PRISONERS TO THE PREFECTURE
AN OTHERWISE TRIVIAL ACT IS FRAUGHT WITH SERIOUS IMPORT NOTHING ASTONISHES AND SHOULD A SMILE THREATEN TO CURVE ONE'S LIPS IT IS INSTANTLY REPRESSED ALL THE SPECTATORS FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE PRISON TO THE KEEPERS
THAT THEY HOLD NEXT TO NOTHING THREE OF THESE GLASSES WERE BROKEN TWO WERE WHOLE ALL OF THEM HAD CONTAINED WINE
SO JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO GET INTO THE CAB I CALLED TO THEM WAIT A BIT MY LITTLE FRIENDS YOU HAVE PROMISED PAPA SOME SOUS WHERE ARE THEY THE ONE WHO HAD CALLED AFTER THE CAB AT ONCE HANDED ME THIRTY FRANCS
FATHER ABSINTHE AND THE VIRTUOUS TOINON ALIGHT FROM THIS VERY VEHICLE HIS PEACE OF MIND AT ONCE RETURNED AND IT WAS IN A VERY IMPORTANT AND SOMEWHAT HUSKY TONE
THAT HE SHOULD SUSPECT OUR PRESENT PERPLEXITY AH YOU ARE A HUNDRED TIMES RIGHT EXCLAIMED THE MAGISTRATE I OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT MYSELF IN HIS POSITION HE CAN SCARCELY HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH AS YET
THIS HAS BEEN A REMARKABLY QUIET NIGHT FOR SHROVE SUNDAY QUITE SURPRISING INDEED IT IS TRUE YOUR HUNT WAS INTERRUPTED YOU HAD A DRUNKEN MAN HERE HOWEVER NO YES THAT'S TRUE
ACCORDINGLY LECOQ MADE A GESTURE OF ASSENT AND THEN HURRIED TOWARD THE MORGUE IF THERE WAS A CROWD ON THE ROADWAY OUTSIDE IT WAS BECAUSE THE GLOOMY BUILDING ITSELF WAS CRAMMED FULL OF PEOPLE INDEED THE SIGHTSEERS
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT ALREADY THREE TIMES SINCE YESTERDAY REJOINED THE PRISONER IMPATIENTLY
AND HE NOW CAME TO THE MAGISTRATE FOR ADVICE REGARDING HIM I COME TO ASK SAID HE IF I AM STILL TO RETAIN THE PRISONER MAY IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT YES
I LODGE AT HIS PLACE BECAUSE I HAVE SOME SMALL INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS YOU SEE THE YOUNG DETECTIVE WAS HASTENING AWAY WHEN PAPILLON CALLED HIM BACK WHEN YOU LEAVE THE MORGUE YOU WILL WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE HE SAID
HE ORDERED HER TO LEAVE THE ROOM AT ONCE BUT THE POOR CREATURE WAS QUITE OVERCOME AND TREMBLED LIKE A LEAF HER EYES WERE FIXED UPON HER UNWORTHY HUSBAND AND THE HAPPINESS SHE FELT AT SEEING HIM AGAIN SHONE PLAINLY IN HER ANXIOUS GAZE
HE HAD IN POINT OF FACT CAREFULLY NOTED HIS ATTITUDE HIS TONE OF VOICE HIS LOOKS AND GESTURES
EXCHANGING JESTS WELL CALCULATED TO MAKE AN ORDINARY MORTAL'S FLESH CREEP AS A RULE THEY ARE FAR LESS INTERESTED IN THE CORPSES LAID OUT FOR PUBLIC VIEW ON THE MARBLE SLABS IN THE PRINCIPAL HALL
HE FELT SURE THAT THE DISGRACEFUL POSITION IN WHICH THE PRISONER WOULD FIND HIMSELF WOULD CAUSE HIM TO REVOLT TO LOSE HIS SELF CONTROL TO UTTER SOME WORD THAT MIGHT GIVE THE DESIRED CLUE IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE GLOOMY VEHICLE
EIGHTEEN OUT OF EVERY TWENTY CRIMINALS WHO APPEAR BEFORE OUR INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATES COME PREPARED WITH A MORE OR LESS COMPLETE PLAN OF DEFENSE WHICH THEY HAVE CONCEIVED DURING THEIR PRELIMINARY CONFINEMENT
AND PERSUADED THAT NO PROOFS CAN BE PRODUCED AGAINST HIM IT IS A YET MORE ARDUOUS TASK TO MAKE A WOMAN SIMILARLY SITUATED SPEAK THE TRUTH AS THEY SAY AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE
IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT WHILE THE PROPRIETORS HOUSES AND THE FARMERS HOUSES HAVE BEEN ENLARGED AND IMPROVED SO MUCH DURING THE LAST CENTURY THE COTTAGE OF THE HIND AND THE COTTER SHOULD STILL BE OF THE SAME MISERABLE DESCRIPTION
ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AFTER SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS BUSINESS MISS RENNIE AND MISS WILSON CAME IN WITH MOST IMPORTANT LOOKING FACES WHILE MISS WILSON WAS BUSIED TURNING OVER THE FASHION BOOKS HER FRIEND WHISPERED TO ELSIE
AS EVERY UNBELIEVER ALWAYS FEELS AT FIRST BUT THE EAGERNESS OF THE LARGE PARTY WHO WERE GATHERED TOGETHER HAD SOMETHING INFECTIOUS IN IT MANY OF THEM HAD KNOWN SEVERE BEREAVEMENT
BUT HERE MISTER DEMPSTER'S ATTENTION WAS CALLED TO A MESSAGE FROM AN OLD FRIEND WHO HAD JUST DIED
AND TOO GENERALLY DONE BY THE ENCLOSED BEDS WHICH ARE NOT RIGHT THINGS IN A SANITARY POINT OF VIEW THE MONEY VALUE OF THE RENT IS INCREASED TOO
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET UP THE CLASSES THAT I HOPED FOR I THINK I MUST TAKE TO MISSUS DUNN'S AND THE DRESSMAKING FOR WE CANNOT GO ON AS WE ARE DOING AH JANE MY CUP OF PROSPERITY HAS VERY MANY BITTER DROPS IN IT
HERE IS YOUR ADDRESS SAID MISTER BRANDON
BUT AS TO THE PRESENT THEIR VIEWS ARE SURE TO BE CORRECT SAID FRANCIS IF THEY ARE GOOD SPIRITS AND NOT LYING SPIRITS WE PRAYED AGAINST THEIR APPEARANCE AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE SPIRIT
THAN A CENTURY BACK I HAVE GOT PLANS FOR THE COTTAGES WHICH I WANTED YOU TO LOOK AT THIS MORNING I THINK THEY WILL DO YOU
AND HER HABITUAL ASSUMPTION THAT SHE KNEW EVERYTHING MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE BECAME TIRESOME WHEN HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN HER SUPERIORITY HE BEGAN TOO TO CONTRAST THE CHARM OF A FACE
HARRIETT OPENED IT AND WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE ELSIE HOLDING IN HER HAND THE SECOND BONNET COMPLETED EQUALLY BEAUTIFUL EQUALLY TASTEFUL AND APPARENTLY QUITE AS EXPENSIVE OH
MISTER DALZELL WITH HIS MOTHER AND TWO YOUNG LADY COUSINS WERE OF THE PARTY I THOUGHT THE COUNTY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HELD THEMSELVES ALOOF FROM THE MORE PLEBEIAN SOCIETY OF AN EDINBURGH BANKER
FOR THERE NEVER WAS A MORE ESTIMABLE WOMAN THAN PEGGY WALKER OR MORE PROMISING CHILDREN THAN HER NEPHEWS AND NIECES YOU CANNOT FANCY WHAT INTEREST I FEEL IN TOM AND HOW I AM AMBITIOUS FOR HIM HE WILL MAKE A FIGURE IN THE WORLD
BEREAVEMENT IN ALL ITS VARIED BITTERNESS HAS BEEN SUNG BY MANY POETS IN STRAINS WORTHY OF THE SUBJECT BUT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SO INSIDIOUS AND OFTEN SO PROSAIC THAT THEIR TRAGICAL OPERATION HAS BEEN RARELY TREATED OF IN VERSE
MISS WILSON WAS WARD OF MISSUS RENNIE'S AS JANE HAD HEARD A WEST INDIAN HEIRESS SOMEWHAT STUPID AND VERY MUCH IMPRESSED WITH HER OWN WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE MISS RENNIE HAD A PITYING SORT OF LIKING FOR HER
SO THAT MISTER BRANDON HAD COME SOONER THAN HE HAD INTENDED AND PROPOSED AN EARLY DEPARTURE ELSIE LOOKED SO GLAD SO VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM EXPRESSED HERSELF SO GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR ALL THE TROUBLE HE WAS TAKING FOR HER
HAS SHE NONE OF THE ALLEVIATIONS THAT YOU ARE SO GOOD AS TO MAKE THE VERY MOST OF ASKED FRANCIS
SHE MISSED THE LONG WALKS SHE HAD DAILY TAKEN IN JANE'S PLEASANT COMPANY IT WAS NOT FAR FROM PEGGY'S HOUSE TO MISSUS DUNN'S PLACE OF BUSINESS AND IT WAS A VERY MONOTONOUS WALK THE WHITE REGULAR HOUSES ALL OF ONE SIZE AND HEIGHT
WHEN IT IS TO GET A PARTNER FOR ALICE MISS MELVILLE I SUPPOSE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT DANCING SHE IS SO DREADFULLY MATTER OF FACT I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING POLITICS OR SOMETHING AS BAD IN THAT CORNER ALL THIS EVENING
WITH MUCH MORE ANIMATION THAN WAS USUAL WITH HER NOW SAID MISS RENNIE I HAVE DONE MY BEST FOR MISTER DALZELL I MUST ATTEND TO MY OTHER STRANGER BEFORE I FULFIL MY ENGAGEMENT TO YOU MISTER HOGARTH AND I HOPE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT NOW BOUGHT A FLOCK AND RUN FOR AN OLD SONG
HE TOOK IT VERY RELUCTANTLY FOR HE SAID HIS OWN AFFAIRS WERE ENOUGH FOR HIM AND PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE THAN ENOUGH SAID BRANDON WITH A SMILE IN THAT CASE I WILL BE VERY GLAD TO DO ALL IN MY POWER FOR YOU
NOT THAT SHE GRUDGED IT FOR TO PUT HALF A CROWN IN POOR LIZZIE MARR'S POCKET WAS WORTH A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE AND FATIGUE
IN DERBYSHIRE
FRANCIS WAS WONDERING IF HIS FATHER NOW SAW THE MISTAKE HE HAD COMMITTED OR REGRETTED IT WHEN HE WAS STARTLED BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HIS FATHER WAS IN THE ROOM AND WISHED TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM
STARTING UP INCREDULOUSLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME SOMEWHAT AWED BY THE MERE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH A ONE WAS THERE OUT OF THE BODY OWNING HIM AS HIS SON WHICH HE HAD NOT DONE WHILE HE WAS ALIVE DOES THE SPIRIT MEAN TO COMMUNICATE BY RAPS OR THROUGH THE MEDIUM
I MUST KEEP TO MY OWN DEPARTMENT OH LAURA WANTS YOUR TASTE TO HELP US TO DECIDE YOU KNOW BETTER WHAT SUITS THAN MADEMOISELLE SAID MISS RENNIE BUT I AM GOING TO BE BUSY HERE SAID ELSIE WHO NEVER FELT MUCH DISPOSED TO WAIT ON MISS WILSON
FOR THEY HAD AN EXTENSIVE FAMILY CONNECTION AND MISTER RENNIE WAS A KIND AND HOSPITABLE MAN WHO HAD A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE IN THE CITY MISS RENNIE HAD JUDGED HARDLY OF JANE'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE AT FIRST SIGHT
BUT TO OTHERS WHO LIKE MANY BEFORE HIM HAD INTELLIGENTLY ACCEPTED OF A STERNER THEOLOGY AND WHO HAD BEEN STRUGGLING THROUGH YEARS OF CHAOTIC DOUBTS AND FANCIES FOR FOOTING ON WHICH TO REST HE SAW THAT THESE ASSURANCES GAVE REAL STRENGTH AND SUPPORT
NAME THEM AS THEY COME IN TOM JAMIE NANCY JESSIE WILLIE A FINE LOT OF YOUNGSTERS UPON MY WORD AND SURE TO MAKE GOOD COLONISTS
AND YOU HEARD HER AGE BUT WE MUST MAKE A NOTE OF THE DATE AND ASCERTAIN IF SHE IS PARTICULARLY WORSE TO NIGHT I FEEL SURE THAT THERE ARE NOT MANY DAYS OF THIS EARTH FOR HER AND HOW BLESSED A THING IT IS
THE SPIRIT WAS IN THE RIGHT NOT TO ANSWER IT ARE YOU CONVINCED SAID MISTER DEMPSTER WHO HAD SEEN THE SURPRISE WITH WHICH MISTER HOGARTH HAD SPELLED OUT THE ANSWERS I AM STAGGERED SAID FRANCIS
AND HE COULD NOT FAIL TO SEE THAT AN ADDITIONAL COLDNESS HAD COME OVER HER WHEN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE LESS FLOURISHING AND THIS MADE HIM RATHER DISPOSED
A MAN WITH NO RELATIONS WHO RECOGNIZED HIS EXISTENCE AND WHO IS CONSCIOUS OF THE DOUBTFULNESS OF HIS BIRTH AS I WAS
SEES MORE INTO OTHER SOULS AND THEIR WORKINGS THAN WE CAN POSSIBLY DO WHILE ENCUMBERED WITH THESE ROBES OF CLAY AND CONSEQUENTLY CAN MAKE A JUSTER GENERALIZATION SAID MISTER DEMPSTER BUT NOT AN INFALLIBLE ONE SAID FRANCIS
THERE WAS NEVER ANY POWER OF KNOWING FROM WHAT PART OF THE ROOM THE RAPS WOULD COME AND AS ANSWER AFTER ANSWER APPEARED TO COME SO READILY TO HIS QUESTIONS
NOTHING HAS STRUCK ME AS SO PATHETIC AS THE CONDITION OF THE ENGLISH FARM LABOURER SO HOPELESS SO CHEERLESS OUR SCOTTISH PEASANTS HAVE MORE EDUCATION MORE ENERGY AND ARE MORE DISPOSED TO EMIGRATE
GEORGIANA GAVE WAY TO HER SO MUCH SHE HAD APPEARED MORE AMIABLE THAN SHE DID NOW THE ARMED NEUTRALITY WHICH SHE MAINTAINED WITH HER SISTER IN LAW HAD AMUSED BRANDON AT FIRST BUT NOW IT APPEARED TO HIM TO BE UNLADYLIKE AND UNGRACEFUL TO ACCEPT
OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS DEALING SO FATAL A BLOW TO THE SON WHOM HE MEANT TO BLESS AND REWARD BY PLACING HIM IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE HE COULD NOT HELP LOVING JANE AND FORBIDDING SO FAR AS HE COULD FORBID THE MARRIAGE OF TWO SOULS MADE FOR ONE ANOTHER
FRANCIS HAD HOPED TO SEE HIS COUSINS BEFORE HE MET THEM AT THE PARTY BUT WHEN HE CALLED AT PEGGY WALKER'S HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE OUT TAKING THEIR CUSTOMARY LONG WALK SO HE MET THEM IN MISSUS RENNIE'S DRAWING ROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME
JANE WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED IN OCCUPATIONS THAT DEMANDED INTELLIGENCE AND THOUGHT SHE HAD ACCESS TO BOOKS SHE WENT TO THEATRES AND PLACES OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT EVEN MORE THAN SHE CARED FOR
AND MAKING IT PRODUCE THE MOST ABUNDANT CROPS SHOWS ME THE FALLACY OF OUR INSULAR NOTIONS ON THAT HEAD I CANNOT BUT REGRET THE DECREASE OF THE YEOMANRY CLASS IN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE ACCUMULATION OF LARGE ESTATES IN FEW HANDS
AND SHE HAD NO OBJECTION TO SUCH AN ESTABLISHMENT FOR HERSELF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO PARTICULARLY FOND OF MISTER BRANDON AS TO ACCEPT FOR HIS SAKE A LIFE SO VERY DIFFERENT AND SO VERY MUCH INFERIOR SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD BEEN DECEIVED
SAID SHE THERE'S A GENTLEMAN AT THE STAIRFOOT SAID TOM HE SAYS HE HAS COME FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTER MISS MELVILLE AND AS IT WAS OUR DINNER TIME HE WOULD NOT COME UP
WHEN A SHARP TAP WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR AND PEGGY OPENED IT AND THEY BEHELD NOT FRANCIS BUT MISTER BRANDON
AND EGOTISM PEEPING OUT IN THE MOST TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCES HE OBSERVED HOW DIFFERENT HER MANNER WAS TOWARDS HIM NOW THAT A MAN OF PROPERTY IN THE OLD COUNTRY HAD APPEARED IN THE CIRCLE OF HER ACQUAINTANCES
YOU ARE UNFAIR AND UNJUST MARGARET COMPRESSED HER LIPS SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK IN ANSWER TO SUCH ACCUSATIONS BUT FOR ALL THAT FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE WORDS HE COULD HAVE THROWN HIMSELF AT HER FEET AND KISSED THE HEM OF HER GARMENT
HALF FARM HOUSE HALF INN STANDING A LITTLE APART FROM THE ROAD AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT THE HOST DID NOT SO DEPEND ON THE CUSTOM OF TRAVELLERS AS TO HAVE TO COURT IT BY ANY OBTRUSIVENESS
WHEN TRADE IS BAD THERE'S MORE UNDERMINING OF HEALTH AND PREPARATION FOR DEATH GOING ON AMONG YOU MILTON MEN THAN YOU'RE AWARE OF NOT WITH ME DOCTOR I'M MADE OF IRON THE NEWS OF THE WORST BAD DEBT I EVER HAD NEVER MADE MY PULSE VARY THIS STRIKE
CREAKING OF ONE OF THE BOARDS REMINDED HER THAT SHE MUST MAKE NO NOISE SHE WENT AND CURLED HERSELF UP
WHOSE STEPS WERE REGULATED BY THE FEEBLENESS OF THE LATTER SHE NOW SPOKE TO THE GIRL AND THERE WAS A SOUND OF TENDER PITY IN THE TONE OF HER VOICE AS SHE DID SO THAT WENT RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE FATHER
BUT YOU ARE HARDLY ACQUAINTED WITH OUR DARKSHIRE FELLOWS FOR ALL YOU'RE A DARKSHIRE MAN YOURSELF THEY HAVE SUCH A SENSE OF HUMOUR AND SUCH A RACY MODE OF EXPRESSION
MARGARET TOOK UP A PEN AND SCRAWLED WITH TREMBLING HAND MARGARET HALE IS NOT THE GIRL TO SAY HIM NAY IN HER WEAK STATE SHE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY OTHER WORDS
SHE HAD HEARD IT ALL HER LIFE BUT IT WERE VERY CRUEL FOR ALL THAT MARGARET GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND WALKED AWAY SICK AT HEART YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL NOT TO TRIUMPH OVER ME SAID MISTER BELL
TO FIND FROM WHAT MISTER HORSFALL SAID
BUT IT WAS ONE OF MISSUS THORNTON'S RIGOROUS LAWS OF HOSPITALITY THAT OF EACH SEPARATE DAINTY ENOUGH SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR ALL THE GUESTS TO PARTAKE IF THEY FELT INCLINED
JUST LONGING FOR A BIT OF A CHANGE A BIT OF A FILLIP AS IT WERE I KNOW I HA GONE AND BOUGHT A FOUR POUNDER
HE HAD NOT YET RESUMED THE INSTRUCTION TO HIS PUPILS WHICH HE HAD RELINQUISHED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS WIFE'S MORE SERIOUS ILLNESS SO HE HAD FEWER OCCUPATIONS THAN USUAL AND THE GREAT INTEREST OF THE LAST DAY OR SO BOUCHER'S SUICIDE
MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM MISTER THORNTON WENT STRAIGHT AND CLEAR INTO ALL THE INTERESTS OF THE FOLLOWING DAY THERE WAS A SLIGHT DEMAND FOR FINISHED GOODS AND AS IT AFFECTED HIS BRANCH OF THE TRADE HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT AND DROVE HARD BARGAINS
MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AT FIRST WHEN I HEARD FROM ONE OF MY SERVANTS THAT YOU HAD BEEN SEEN WALKING ABOUT WITH A GENTLEMAN SO FAR FROM HOME AS THE OUTWOOD STATION AT SUCH A TIME OF THE EVENING I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT
HE OPENED THE ROOM DOOR AND STOOD THERE UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO COME IN HIS FACE WAS GRAY AND PALE HE HAD A TIMID FEARFUL LOOK IN HIS EYES SOMETHING ALMOST PITIFUL TO SEE IN A MAN'S FACE
BUT I SAW THAT THE MEN WOULD BE HURT IF AFTER MAKING THE ADVANCE I DIDN'T MEET THEM HALF WAY SO I WENT IN AND I NEVER MADE A BETTER DINNER IN MY LIFE I TOLD THEM MY NEXT NEIGHBOURS I MEAN FOR I'M NO SPEECH MAKER
AND TELL HIM ALSO THAT I GAVE YOU LEAVE TO DO SO BECAUSE I FELT THAT FOR PAPA'S SAKE I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO LOSE HIS RESPECT THOUGH WE MAY NEVER BE LIKELY TO MEET AGAIN CERTAINLY I THINK HE OUGHT TO KNOW
WHEN THERE HAD BEEN A CONTINUAL STRAINED LISTENING FOR SOME SOUND OR SIGNAL FROM THE SICK ROOM AFTER BREAKFAST
I AM SO TIRED SO TIRED OF BEING WHIRLED ON THROUGH ALL THESE PHASES OF MY LIFE IN WHICH NOTHING ABIDES BY ME NO CREATURE NO PLACE IT IS LIKE THE CIRCLE IN WHICH THE VICTIMS OF EARTHLY PASSION EDDY CONTINUALLY
BUT THE EVENINGS WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILL UP AGREEABLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER TEA HER FATHER WITHDREW INTO HIS SMALL LIBRARY AND SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT ALONE MISSUS HALE HAD NEVER CARED MUCH FOR BOOKS
AND MISTER BELL WAS FAIN TO RESORT TO HIS FORMER OCCUPATION OF TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW HE COULD BEST BREAK THE NEWS TO MARGARET SHE WAS AT AN UP STAIRS WINDOW SHE SAW HIM ALIGHT SHE GUESSED THE TRUTH WITH AN INSTINCTIVE FLASH
SO MOST OF THE MANUFACTURERS PLACED THEIR SONS IN SUCKING SITUATIONS AT FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE
I DO NOT LIKE YOU TO REST EVEN UNDER THE SHADOW OF AN IMPROPRIETY HE WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF SEEING YOU ALONE WITH A YOUNG MAN AS FOR THAT SAID MARGARET RATHER HAUGHTILY
THEY MUST DEGRADE YOU IN THE LONG RUN IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD EVEN IF IN FACT THEY DO NOT LEAD YOU TO POSITIVE HARM FOR MY MOTHER'S SAKE SAID MARGARET IN A TEARFUL VOICE I WILL BEAR MUCH BUT I CANNOT BEAR EVERYTHING
THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN BUT THE SIMPLE TRUTH WHEN SHE HAD DESCRIBED HER FATHER'S LIVING AS VERY SMALL MARGARET MY CHILD YOU MIGHT HAVE GATHERED US SOME PEARS FOR OUR DESSERT SAID MISTER HALE
IT SHOWED THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS MY YOUNG LADY THOUGHT MISSUS THORNTON TO HERSELF YOU'VE A PRETTY GOOD TEMPER OF YOUR OWN IF JOHN AND YOU HAD COME TOGETHER HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO KEEP A TIGHT HAND OVER YOU TO MAKE YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE
COULD HAVE REPORTED HER AS HAVING LOST ALL HER GOOD LOOKS TO BE SURE IN HER QUIET BLACK DRESS SHE WAS A CONTRAST TO EDITH DANCING IN HER WHITE CRAPE MOURNING AND LONG FLOATING GOLDEN HAIR ALL SOFTNESS AND GLITTER
AND SHE THE MOST MUSICAL OFFICER'S WIFE THERE HAD TO COPY THE NEW AND POPULAR TUNES
AND TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE WAS ALIVE WHEN I WENT IN HE WOULD BE QUITE QUIET BUT ALL IN A MAZE LIKE
WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
BECAUSE IT IS SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM HELSTONE PARTLY BECAUSE MISTER BELL SAYS THERE IS AN OPENING THERE FOR A PRIVATE TUTOR PRIVATE TUTOR IN MILTON
SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SOB WITH SO LITTLE RESTRAINT
ALWAYS CALLED THE JUST AFTER A QUIET LIFE IN A COUNTRY PARSONAGE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS THERE WAS SOMETHING DAZZLING TO MISTER HALE IN THE ENERGY WHICH CONQUERED IMMENSE DIFFICULTIES WITH EASE
MY BROTHER JOHN GOES TO HIM TWICE A WEEK AND SO HE BEGGED MAMMA TO ASK THEM HERE IN HOPES OF GETTING HIM KNOWN I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME OF THEIR PROSPECTUSES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE MISTER THORNTON
THEY SPARE NO EXPENSE THEY SEND OUT SHIPS THEY SCOUR THE SEAS TO LAY HOLD OF THE OFFENDERS THE LAPSE OF YEARS DOES NOT WASH OUT THE MEMORY OF THE OFFENCE IT IS A FRESH AND VIVID CRIME ON THE ADMIRALTY BOOKS TILL IT IS BLOTTED OUT BY BLOOD
SO BOUCHER SLUNK BACK AGAIN TO HIS HOUSE
WHY THE MAYOR HISSEL DINES THERE AND THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND ALL I THINK I COULD SUPPORT THE HONOUR OF MEETING THE MAYOR OF MILTON BUT THEM LADIES DRESS SO GRAND SAID BESSY
BUT SHE DID NOT EVEN OPEN HER EYES FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
AS IF SHE FELT HIS LOOK SHE TURNED TO HIM AND ASKED A QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME IN HER MIND WHERE ARE THE POOR IMPORTED WORK PEOPLE
WHERE DID YE GET THIS FROCK IN LONDON SAID MARGARET MUCH AMUSED LONDON HAVE YO BEEN IN LONDON YES I LIVED THERE FOR SOME YEARS BUT MY HOME WAS IN A FOREST IN THE COUNTRY TELL ME ABOUT IT SAID BESSY
SHE SAW LADS IN THE BACK GROUND STOOPING TO TAKE OFF THEIR HEAVY WOODEN CLOGS
YOU MUST NOT GO TO THE SOUTH SAID MARGARET FOR ALL THAT YOU COULD NOT STAND IT
A LETTER FROM HENRY LENNOX IT MAKES MARGARET VERY HOPEFUL MISTER BELL NODDED
AND DOES HE NOT ANSWER YOU ASKED MISTER HALE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EVENING SHE WAS CALLED DOWN TO SPEAK TO MARY HIGGINS AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK MISTER HALE IMAGINED THAT HE SAW TRACES OF TEARS ON HER CHEEKS BUT THAT COULD NOT BE FOR SHE BROUGHT GOOD NEWS THAT HIGGINS HAD GOT WORK AT MISTER THORNTON'S MILL
SAID MISSUS THORNTON EAGERLY IT CERTAINLY SIGNIFIES VERY LITTLE TO US NOT AT ALL TO YOU AFTER WHAT HAS PASSED BUT I I MADE A PROMISE TO MISSUS HALE THAT I WOULD NOT ALLOW HER DAUGHTER TO GO WRONG WITHOUT ADVISING AND REMONSTRATING WITH HER
AND INDEED MARGARET THE LONGING TO SEE FREDERICK STANDS BETWEEN ME AND GOD I CANNOT PRAY TILL I HAVE THIS ONE THING INDEED I CANNOT DON'T LOSE TIME DEAR DEAR MARGARET

SHE RAN LIKE THAT SO THAT HE COULD SEE ALL THE END OF HER PETTICOAT RUNNING AND HER SKINNY SHANKS UP AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IT WOULD HAVE SERVED HER JUST RIGHT IF SHE HAD TRIPPED UP OVER SOMETHING ACCIDENTALLY ON PURPOSE

SAYS JOE AND ALF WAS TELLING US THERE WAS ONE CHAP SENT IN A MOURNING CARD WITH A BLACK BORDER ROUND IT THEY'RE ALL BARBERS SAYS HE FROM THE BLACK COUNTRY THAT WOULD HANG THEIR OWN FATHERS FOR FIVE QUID DOWN AND TRAVELLING EXPENSES
AND FITLY IS SHE TOO A HAVEN OF REFUGE FOR THE AFFLICTED BECAUSE OF THE SEVEN DOLOURS WHICH TRANSPIERCED HER OWN HEART GERTY COULD PICTURE THE WHOLE SCENE IN THE CHURCH

HER BONESETTER HER MEDICINEMAN ME SHE SLIGHTS TO THE VOICE THAT WILL SHRIVE AND OIL FOR THE GRAVE ALL THERE IS OF HER BUT HER WOMAN'S UNCLEAN LOINS OF MAN'S FLESH MADE NOT IN GOD'S LIKENESS THE SERPENT'S PREY
A DISPOSITION OR TURN OF MIND WHICH QUALIFIES A MAN TO RISE IN THE WORLD AND ADVANCE HIS FORTUNE IS ENTITLED TO ESTEEM AND REGARD AS HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED IT MAY THEREFORE NATURALLY BE SUPPOSED
BUT THE PRESUMPTION ALWAYS LIES ON THE OTHER SIDE IN ALL ENQUIRIES CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF OUR PASSIONS AND OF THE INTERNAL OPERATIONS OF THE HUMAN MIND
UNCLES AND NIECES FOR A LIKE REASON MIGHT MARRY AT ATHENS BUT NEITHER THESE NOR HALF BROTHERS AND SISTERS COULD CONTRACT THAT ALLIANCE AT ROME WHERE THE INTERCOURSE WAS MORE OPEN BETWEEN THE SEXES
PUBLIC UTILITY IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THESE VARIATIONS TO REPEAT TO A MAN'S PREJUDICE ANYTHING THAT ESCAPED HIM IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION OR TO MAKE ANY SUCH USE OF HIS PRIVATE LETTERS IS HIGHLY BLAMED
OR GOLD IN A DESERT ISLAND WOULD OTHERWISE BE FULL AS VALUABLE WHEN WE APPROACH A MAN WHO IS AS WE SAY AT HIS EASE WE ARE PRESENTED WITH THE PLEASING IDEAS OF PLENTY SATISFACTION CLEANLINESS WARMTH
AND IS REQUISITE TO SUPPORT TRUST AND GOOD CORRESPONDENCE IN SOCIETY BUT IN PLACES OF GENERAL
AND FORM A PART OF PERSONAL MERIT AND ON THE OTHER HAND A CATALOGUE OF THOSE QUALITIES WHICH ARE THE OBJECT OF CENSURE OR REPROACH AND WHICH DETRACT FROM THE CHARACTER OF THE PERSON POSSESSED OF THEM SUBJOINING SOME REFLECTIONS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THESE SENTIMENTS OF PRAISE OR BLAME
OUR PREDOMINANT MOTIVE OR INTENTION IS INDEED FREQUENTLY CONCEALED FROM OURSELVES WHEN IT IS MINGLED AND CONFOUNDED WITH OTHER MOTIVES WHICH THE MIND
WHERE BIRTH IS RESPECTED UNACTIVE SPIRITLESS MINDS REMAIN IN HAUGHTY INDOLENCE AND DREAM OF NOTHING BUT PEDIGREES AND GENEALOGIES
ALL THESE VARIOUS MIXTURES AND COMPOSITIONS AND APPEARANCES OF SENTIMENT FROM A VERY CURIOUS SUBJECT OF SPECULATION BUT ARE WIDE FOR OUR PRESENT PURPOSE THROUGHOUT THIS ENQUIRY WE ALWAYS CONSIDER IN GENERAL WHAT QUALITIES ARE A SUBJECT OF PRAISE OR OF CENSURE
AS ILL ADAPTED TO THE FIGURE OF A HUMAN CREATURE FOR WHOSE SERVICE THE FABRIC WAS INTENDED WHAT WONDER THEN THAT A MAN WHOSE HABITS AND CONDUCT ARE HURTFUL TO SOCIETY AND DANGEROUS OR PERNICIOUS TO EVERY ONE WHO HAS AN INTERCOURSE WITH HIM SHOULD ON THAT ACCOUNT
ARE OBSERVED TO BE THE MORE USUAL OBJECTS OF PRIDE AND SELF CONCEIT AND WHEN BOASTED OF BEGET A STRONG SUSPICION OF THESE SENTIMENTS IT IS HARD TO TELL WHETHER YOU HURT A MAN'S CHARACTER MOST BY CALLING HIM A KNAVE OR A COWARD
IN ALL THESE CASES THE PASSION WHICH ARISES FROM THE PLEASURE IS MORE PROPERLY DENOMINATED ESTEEM THAN LOVE BENEVOLENCE ATTENDS BOTH BUT IS CONNECTED WITH LOVE IN A MORE EMINENT DEGREE
WHAT IS THERE TOO WE ARE MORE ANXIOUS TO CONCEAL FROM OTHERS THAN SUCH BLUNDERS INFIRMITIES AND MEANNESSES OR MORE DREAD TO HAVE EXPOSED BY RAILLERY AND SATIRE
IT HAS OFTEN BEEN ASSERTED THAT AS EVERY MAN HAS A STRONG CONNEXION WITH SOCIETY AND PERCEIVES THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HIS SOLITARY SUBSISTENCE HE BECOMES ON THAT ACCOUNT FAVOURABLE TO ALL THOSE HABITS OR PRINCIPLES WHICH PROMOTE ORDER IN SOCIETY
THAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE RANKED UNDER THE SAME CLASS OR APPELLATION A VERY SMALL VARIATION OF THE OBJECT EVEN WHERE THE SAME QUALITIES ARE PRESERVED WILL DESTROY A SENTIMENT
BUT THE TOPICS OF PRAISE WHICH WE INSIST ON ARE VERY WIDE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AND WE MAY ATTEMPT TO BRING OVER OTHERS TO OUR SENTIMENTS WITHOUT ENDEAVOURING TO CONVINCE THEM
HUMAN NATURE CANNOT BY ANY MEANS SUBSIST WITHOUT THE ASSOCIATION OF INDIVIDUALS AND THAT ASSOCIATION NEVER COULD HAVE PLACE WERE NO REGARD PAID TO THE LAWS OF EQUITY AND JUSTICE DISORDER CONFUSION THE WAR OF ALL AGAINST ALL
I SHALL NOT HERE ENTER INTO ANY DETAIL ON THE PRESENT SUBJECT MANY ABLE PHILOSOPHERS HAVE SHOWN THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THESE SYSTEMS AND I SHALL TAKE FOR GRANTED WHAT
LOVE AND ESTEEM ARE NEARLY THE SAME PASSION AND ARISE FROM SIMILAR CAUSES THE QUALITIES WHICH PRODUCE BOTH ARE SUCH AS COMMUNICATE PLEASURES BUT WHERE THIS PLEASURE IS SEVERE AND SERIOUS
THOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE CAN SO SUDDENLY PROPOSE AND PERHAPS HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT OF ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE FROM THEM A TRAVELLER IS ALWAYS ADMITTED INTO COMPANY AND MEETS WITH CIVILITY IN PROPORTION AS HIS TRAIN AND EQUIPAGE
WE SEEK ONLY OUR OWN GRATIFICATION WHILE WE APPEAR THE MOST DEEPLY ENGAGED IN SCHEMES FOR THE LIBERTY AND HAPPINESS OF MANKIND BY A TURN OF IMAGINATION
IN THIS POPE SAYS HE THERE WAS A SINGULAR CAPACITY AND JUDGEMENT ADMIRABLE PRUDENCE A WONDERFUL TALENT OF PERSUASION AND IN ALL MOMENTOUS ENTERPRIZES A DILIGENCE AND DEXTERITY INCREDIBLE BUT THESE VIRTUES WERE INFINITELY OVERBALANCED BY HIS VICES
BUT NATIONS CAN SUBSIST WITHOUT INTERCOURSE THEY MAY EVEN SUBSIST IN SOME DEGREE UNDER A GENERAL WAR THE OBSERVANCE OF JUSTICE THOUGH USEFUL AMONG THEM
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE INCONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES APPEARS TO ME IN PRACTICE PRETTY DURABLE AND UNTRANSMUTABLE
I ESTEEM THE MAN WHOSE SELF LOVE BY WHATEVER MEANS IS SO DIRECTED AS TO GIVE HIM A CONCERN FOR OTHERS AND RENDER HIM SERVICEABLE TO SOCIETY AS I HATE OR DESPISE HIM
IN SHORT THE DIFFERENT RANKS OF MEN ARE IN A GREAT MEASURE REGULATED BY RICHES
WHO DID EVER SAY EXCEPT BY WAY OF IRONY THAT SUCH A ONE WAS A MAN OF GREAT VIRTUE BUT AN EGREGIOUS BLOCKHEAD BUT SECONDLY IT IS NO WONDER THAT LANGUAGES SHOULD NOT BE VERY PRECISE IN MARKING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN VIRTUES AND TALENTS VICES AND DEFECTS
AND PLACING THEM WITH THE GREATEST EXACTNESS ON THEIR PROPER CENTRE OF GRAVITY A FIGURE WHICH IS NOT JUSTLY BALANCED IS UGLY BECAUSE IT CONVEYS THE DISAGREEABLE IDEAS OF FALL HARM AND PAIN FOOTENOTE
IF WE CAN SHOW THE NECESSITY OF THAT PARTICULAR CONSTRUCTION FOR THE USE INTENDED A SHIP APPEARS MORE BEAUTIFUL TO AN ARTIST OR ONE MODERATELY SKILLED IN NAVIGATION WHERE ITS PROW IS WIDE AND SWELLING BEYOND ITS POOP
WHEN PRESSED BY THESE FACTS AND ARGUMENTS TO SAY THAT WE TRANSPORT OURSELVES BY THE FORCE OF IMAGINATION INTO DISTANT AGES AND COUNTRIES AND CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGE WHICH WE SHOULD HAVE REAPED FROM THESE CHARACTERS HAD WE BEEN CONTEMPORARIES AND HAD ANY COMMERCE WITH THE PERSONS
ARTS MANUFACTURES COMMERCE AGRICULTURE FLOURISH THE FORMER PREJUDICE BEING FAVOURABLE TO MILITARY VIRTUE IS MORE SUITED TO MONARCHIES THE LATTER BEING THE CHIEF SPUR TO INDUSTRY AGREES BETTER WITH A REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT
TO RESOLVE THE ELEMENTS OF THIS PASSION IF I MAY SO SPEAK INTO THOSE OF ANOTHER AND EXPLAIN EVERY AFFECTION TO BE SELF LOVE TWISTED AND MOULDED BY A PARTICULAR TURN OF IMAGINATION
THOUGH NOT ALTOGETHER CAPRICIOUS AND ARBITRARY SO FAR IS THERE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND THE RULES OF JUSTICE FIDELITY AND LOYALTY THE GENERAL SOCIETIES OF MEN ARE ABSOLUTELY REQUISITE FOR THE SUBSISTENCE OF THE SPECIES
WHICH HAS BEEN MUCH INSISTED ON BY PHILOSOPHERS AND HAS BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF MANY A SYSTEM THAT WHATEVER AFFECTION ONE MAY FEEL OR IMAGINE HE FEELS FOR OTHERS NO PASSION IS
WE READILY PERCEIVE AND AVOW THE MIXTURE OF THESE DISTINCT SENTIMENTS WHICH HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT FEELING AND INFLUENCE ON THE MIND WE PRAISE PERHAPS WITH MORE ALACRITY WHERE THE GENEROUS HUMANE ACTION CONTRIBUTES TO OUR PARTICULAR INTEREST
BROUGHT THE CARTHAGINIAN STATE INTO THE UTMOST DANGER AND AT LAST DIED IN OLD AGE AND IN POSSESSION OF SOVEREIGN DIGNITY MUST HE NOT BE ALLOWED SOMETHING PRODIGIOUS AND EXTRAORDINARY
A MORAL PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE NEEDS NOT ENTER INTO ALL THESE CAPRICES OF LANGUAGE WHICH ARE SO VARIABLE IN DIFFERENT DIALECTS AND IN DIFFERENT AGES OF THE SAME DIALECT BUT ON THE WHOLE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THOUGH IT IS ALWAYS ALLOWED THAT THERE ARE VIRTUES OF MANY DIFFERENT KINDS
AND IT WERE THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE RENDERED HIMSELF DEARER TO THE GENERAL OR TO THE ARMY TO NONE WOULD HASDRUBAL ENTRUST MORE WILLINGLY THE CONDUCT OF ANY DANGEROUS ENTERPRIZE UNDER NONE DID THE SOLDIERS DISCOVER MORE COURAGE AND CONFIDENCE
TO A PERFECT SIMPLICITY THE CASE IS NOT THE SAME IN THIS SPECIES OF PHILOSOPHY AS IN PHYSICS MANY AN HYPOTHESIS IN NATURE CONTRARY TO FIRST APPEARANCES
BUT COMPARING OUR OWN SPECIES TO SUPERIOR ONES IT IS A VERY MORTIFYING CONSIDERATION THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE SO LIABLE TO DISEASES AND INFIRMITIES AND DIVINES ACCORDINGLY EMPLOY THIS TOPIC IN ORDER TO DEPRESS SELF CONCEIT AND VANITY
SHOULD MARK THE PRECISE BOUNDARIES OF VIRTUES AND TALENTS VICES AND DEFECTS AND SHOULD EXPLAIN THE REASON AND ORIGIN OF THAT DISTINCTION BUT IN ORDER TO EXCUSE MYSELF FROM THIS UNDERTAKING WHICH WOULD AT LAST PROVE ONLY A GRAMMATICAL ENQUIRY
ARISES FROM THE MOST MINUTE DIFFERENCES OF THICKNESS IN THE MOST MINUTE PARTS OF THE SKIN
BENEVOLENCE NATURALLY DIVIDES INTO TWO KINDS THE GENERAL AND THE PARTICULAR THE FIRST IS WHERE WE HAVE NO FRIENDSHIP OR CONNEXION OR ESTEEM FOR THE PERSON
ABSTAINING FROM POISONED ARMS QUARTER IN WAR WITH OTHERS OF THAT KIND WHICH ARE PLAINLY CALCULATED FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF STATES AND KINGDOMS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH EACH OTHER THE RULES OF JUSTICE
NOT THEIR LOVE OF HUMANITY BUT THE IMPOTENCE OF THEIR LOVE PREVENTS THE CHRISTIANS OF TODAY BURNING US
ONE MUST REPAY GOOD AND ILL BUT WHY JUST TO THE PERSON WHO DID US GOOD OR ILL
THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
GRATITUDE AND PURITY SEVENTY FIVE THE DEGREE AND NATURE OF A MAN'S SENSUALITY EXTENDS TO THE HIGHEST ALTITUDES OF HIS SPIRIT SEVENTY SIX
IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
NOW WITH RED LIGHT NOW WITH GREEN
HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
IN THE EYES OF ALL TRUE WOMEN SCIENCE IS HOSTILE TO THE SENSE OF SHAME THEY FEEL AS IF ONE WISHED TO PEEP UNDER THEIR SKIN WITH IT OR WORSE STILL UNDER THEIR DRESS AND FINERY
DID HE PERHAPS DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT WHEN HE THUS EXHORTED SYSTEMS OF MORALS TO PRACTISE MORALITY BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH IN THE RIGHT
AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVE
PITY HAS AN ALMOST LUDICROUS EFFECT ON A MAN OF KNOWLEDGE LIKE TENDER HANDS ON A CYCLOPS
MANY A PEACOCK HIDES HIS TAIL FROM EVERY EYE AND CALLS IT HIS PRIDE SEVENTY FOUR A MAN OF GENIUS IS UNBEARABLE
NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
FOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERS
THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
THE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURING
CHAPTER SEVEN OUR VIRTUES
A DISCERNING ONE MIGHT EASILY REGARD HIMSELF AT PRESENT AS THE ANIMALIZATION OF GOD ONE HUNDRED TWO DISCOVERING RECIPROCAL LOVE SHOULD REALLY DISENCHANT THE LOVER WITH REGARD TO THE BELOVED
EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
THE BELLY IS THE REASON WHY MAN DOES NOT SO READILY TAKE HIMSELF FOR A GOD
AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
THAT WHICH AN AGE CONSIDERS EVIL IS USUALLY AN UNSEASONABLE ECHO OF WHAT WAS FORMERLY CONSIDERED GOOD THE ATAVISM OF AN OLD IDEAL
SIXTY FIVE THE CHARM OF KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE SMALL WERE IT NOT SO MUCH SHAME HAS TO BE OVERCOME ON THE WAY TO IT SIXTY FIVE A WE ARE MOST DISHONOURABLE TOWARDS OUR GOD
A NATION IS A DETOUR OF NATURE
THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
AND I HEARD ONLY PRAISE ONE HUNDRED WE ALL FEIGN TO OURSELVES THAT WE ARE SIMPLER THAN WE ARE WE THUS RELAX OURSELVES AWAY FROM OUR FELLOWS
A THING THAT IS EXPLAINED CEASES TO CONCERN US WHAT DID THE GOD MEAN WHO GAVE THE ADVICE KNOW THYSELF DID IT PERHAPS IMPLY CEASE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THYSELF BECOME OBJECTIVE
I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS EVERYTHING NOW TURNS OUT BEST FOR ME I NOW LOVE EVERY FATE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE MY FATE
ONE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE FOLLIES OF CLEVER MEN WHAT A FORFEITURE OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN
SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
TO HIM WHO FEELS HIMSELF PREORDAINED TO CONTEMPLATION AND NOT TO BELIEF ALL BELIEVERS ARE TOO NOISY AND OBTRUSIVE HE GUARDS AGAINST THEM
THE MORE ABSTRACT THE TRUTH YOU WISH TO TEACH THE MORE MUST YOU ALLURE THE SENSES TO IT
IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
LOVE BRINGS TO LIGHT THE NOBLE AND HIDDEN QUALITIES OF A LOVER HIS RARE AND EXCEPTIONAL TRAITS IT IS THUS LIABLE TO BE DECEPTIVE AS TO HIS NORMAL CHARACTER
PHARISAISM IS NOT A DETERIORATION OF THE GOOD MAN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF IT IS RATHER AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION OF BEING GOOD
NINETY TWO WHO HAS NOT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR THE SAKE OF HIS GOOD NAME NINETY THREE IN AFFABILITY THERE IS NO HATRED OF MEN
ONE SHOULD PART FROM LIFE AS ULYSSES PARTED FROM NAUSICAA BLESSING IT RATHER THAN IN LOVE WITH IT NINETY SEVEN WHAT A GREAT MAN I ALWAYS SEE MERELY THE PLAY ACTOR OF HIS OWN IDEAL
BY MEANS OF MUSIC THE VERY PASSIONS ENJOY THEMSELVES
NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
ONE OCCASIONALLY EMBRACES SOME ONE OR OTHER OUT OF LOVE TO MANKIND BECAUSE ONE CANNOT EMBRACE ALL BUT THIS IS WHAT ONE MUST NEVER CONFESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL
THAT WERE COLD A CAN TELL THE FIRST I SMARTED ALL OWER ME AS IF MY SKIN WERE SUDDENLY STRIPT OFF ME AND NEXT
AND WHEN WE HAD WIPED OUR EYES CLEAR AND GETTEN OUR HEARTS DOWN AGEN FRA OUR MOUTHS THERE WERE NEVER A BOAT NOR A GLITTERING BELLY O E'ER A GREAT WHALE TO BE SEEN
ONLY A SPECTATOR WITH DAYLIGHT CAME WAKENING AND LITTLE HOMELY EVERY DAY WONDERS
DANIEL INDEED WAS TO RETURN HOME AFTER CONVEYING HIS WIFE TO HER DESTINATION BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE DONE ON THE LAND AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THAT SYLVIA WOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE ALL DAY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ARRANGEMENT JUST MENTIONED
SHE FELT HIS EYES WERE UPON HER WATCHING EVERY MOTION AND GREW MORE AND MORE CONFUSED IN HER EXPRESSION AND BEHAVIOUR HE WAS A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK BY THE NATURE OF HIS RECEPTION AND WAS NOT SURE AT FIRST WHETHER TO TAKE THE GREAT CHANGE IN HER MANNER
AND ONE WAS ON HER LEFT HAND WHICH SHE SUPPOSED HERSELF TO BE MENDING BUT FROM TIME TO TIME SHE MADE LONG PAUSES AND LOOKED IN THE FIRE AND YET THERE WAS BUT LITTLE MOTION OF FLAME OR LIGHT IN IT OUT OF WHICH TO CONJURE VISIONS
PLACED HER NOSE BETWEEN HER PAWS AND WATCHED WITH ATTENTIVE EYES THE PREPARATIONS GOING ON FOR REFRESHMENTS PREPARATIONS WHICH TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF HER CANINE HEART CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF TUMBLERS AND SUGAR WHERE'S T WENCH SAID ROBSON
AN AS A'LL WARRANT SHE'S FORGOTTEN IT AN AS SYLVIA HERE NIVER HEERD IT IF YO'LL FILL YOUR GLASS KINRAID YO SHALL HA T BENEFIT O'T A
HE WOUND UP WITH A CHUCKLE AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM THAT THIS GREAT PIECE OF BUSINESS OF DISPOSING OF THEIR ONLY CHILD HAD BEEN CONCLUDED WHILE HIS WIFE WAS AWAY
AS TO MAKE IT AN EXPENSIVE SOMETIMES AN UNATTAINABLE LUXURY TO THE WORKING MAN GOVERNMENT DID MORE TO DEMORALISE THE POPULAR SENSE OF RECTITUDE AND UPRIGHTNESS THAN HEAPS OF SERMONS COULD UNDO
AND I'LL BE HOME AGAIN AS SOON AS IVER I CAN IN HALF A YEAR SUCH AS HE FORGETS IF IVER HE'S THOUGHT SERIOUS ABOUT HER BUT IN A MY LIFETIME IF I LIVE TO FOURSCORE I CAN NIVER FORGET
THERE WAS MUCH TO BE DONE IN FOSTERS SHOP AND LATER HOURS WERE KEPT THAN USUAL SOME PERPLEXITY OR OTHER WAS OCCUPYING JOHN AND JEREMIAH FOSTER
AND THEN MY MASTER SAW ANOTHER GIRL THAT HE LIKED BETTER' WILLIAM ALMOST CHOKED IN HIS ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP DOWN ALL APPEARANCE OF VIOLENT ANGER AND THEN WENT ON AND THAT HE PLAYED T SAME GAME WI AS I'VE HEERD TELL AND HOW DID THY SISTER TAKE IT
AND IN A MOMENT KINRAID RECOGNIZED HER AS THE PRETTY LITTLE GIRL HE HAD SEEN CRYING SO BITTERLY OVER DARLEY'S GRAVE HE ROSE UP OUT OF TRUE SAILOR'S GALLANTRY AS SHE SHYLY APPROACHED AND STOOD BY HER FATHER'S SIDE SCARCELY DARING TO LIFT HER GREAT SOFT EYES TO HAVE ONE FAIR GAZE AT HIS FACE
INDEED THEY WERE OFTEN MORE COMMUNICATIVE TO THE SHEEP DOG THAT ACCOMPANIED THEM THROUGH ALL THE DAY'S WORK AND FREQUENTLY BECAME A SORT OF DUMB CONFIDANT
I SHALL BE A LONG TIME AWAY PERHAPS I MAY NIVER COME BACK AT ALL HERE HE BITTERLY THOUGHT OF AN UNREGARDED DEATH SAY GOOD BY NO ANSWER HE WAITED PATIENTLY CAN SHE BE WEARIED OUT AND GONE TO SLEEP HE WONDERED YET ONCE AGAIN
GLITTERING ICEBERGS BEARING MERCILESSLY DOWN ON THE URANIA NOR SHUDDERING ANTICIPATION OF THE DARK WAVES OF EVIL IMPORT CROSSED HER MIND HE LOVED HER AND THAT WAS ENOUGH HER EYES LOOKED TRANCE LIKE INTO A DIM GLORIOUS FUTURE OF LIFE
WELL LUCKILY FOR US WE HAD OUR SECOND BOAT
MISCHIEF ONLY KNOWS BUT SHE'S NOAN KEEN ON MATTERIMONY
THAT SHE WHOM HE LOVED HAD ASKED HIM TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND HE HAD NEGLECTED IT SO ANXIOUS TO BE EXCUSED AND FORGIVEN HE WENT ON WITH THE APOLOGY SHE CARED NOT TO HEAR IF SHE HAD BEEN LESS OCCUPIED WITH HER OWN AFFAIRS LESS ENGROSSED WITH DEEP FEELING
THE CHEERFUL CLICK OF THE KNITTING NEEDLES MADE A PLEASANT HOME SOUND AND IN THE OCCASIONAL SNATCHES OF SLUMBER THAT OVERCAME HER MOTHER SYLVIA COULD HEAR THE LONG RUSHING BOOM OF THE WAVES DOWN BELOW THE ROCKS FOR THE HAYTERSBANK GULLEY ALLOWED THE SULLEN ROAR TO COME UP SO FAR INLAND
BUT TO WHOM THEY HAD LATTERLY ADVANCED MONEY THE LETTERS HINTED AT THE UTTER INSOLVENCY OF THIS MANUFACTURER THEY HAD URGED THEIR CORRESPONDENT TO GIVE THEM HIS NAME IN CONFIDENCE AND THIS MORNING'S LETTER HAD BROUGHT IT
THOUGH T CAPTAIN SHOULD CA IT MUTINY TO DISOBEY ORDERS
SO A TUGGED AND A LUGGED
CONSCIOUS OF THE DEMAND IN WHICH THEY WERE HELD AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR IT WAS WAR TIME TOO MANY CAPTAINS UNABLE TO PROCURE MEN IN MONKSHAVEN WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE THEIR CREWS IN THE SHETLANDS THE SHOPS IN THE TOWN WERE EQUALLY BUSY
IS HE HERE AGAIN SAID PHILIP I DIDN'T SEE HIM WHAT BRINGS HIM HERE
DARK THE WOOD FIRE NOT GATHERED TOGETHER BY CAREFUL HANDS DIED OUT INTO GRAY ASHES DOLLY REID HAD DONE HER WORK AND GONE HOME THERE WERE BUT PHILIP AND SYLVIA IN THE HOUSE
OUR VOICES DID NA RIGHTLY SEEM OUR OWN AND WE SAILED ON AND WE SAILED ON
IT'S A CHANCE MISSUS AS THOU HAD STOPPED AN OUD MAID EH DEAR A ME SAID BELL
HAD GIVEN HIM THE CHANCE OF SEEING HER ALONE AND OBTAINING HER PROMISE TO MARRY HIM WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO TELL EITHER HER FATHER OR HER MOTHER AT PRESENT I HA SPENT MY MONEY PRETTY FREE HE SAID AND I'VE NE'ER A PENNY TO THE FORE
THAT THE FOSTERS HAD FOR SOME TIME RECEIVED ANONYMOUS LETTERS WARNING THEM WITH DISTINCT MEANING THOUGH IN AMBIGUOUS TERMS AGAINST A CERTAIN SILK MANUFACTURER IN SPITALFIELDS WITH WHOM THEY HAD HAD STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS DEALINGS FOR MANY YEARS
AS I WERE SA FOND ON AND FED MYSEL AND AS WOULD HA BEEN FOURTEEN STONE BY NOW IF HE WERE AN OUNCE AND AS KNEW ME AS WELL AS ANY CHRISTIAN AND A PIG AS I MAY SAY THAT I JUST IDOLIZED WENT AND TOOK A FIT A WEEK AFTER MICHAELMAS DAY AND DIED AS IF IT HAD BEEN TO SPITE ME
AND TO SEE SYLVIA FOR THE TWO FOSTERS WERE PUNCTILIOUSLY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THEIR SHOPMEN TEST ALL THEIR STATEMENTS INSISTING ON AN EXAMINATION OF THE STOCK AS IF HEPBURN AND COULSON WERE STRANGERS TO THE SHOP
WELL THE FAST BOATS WERE OUT AFTER A FISH
I SHALL BE MAIN GLAD TO SEE THEE IF THOU'LT COME BUT I'VE NA LADS TO KEEP THEE COMPANY ONLY ONE SPRIG OF A WENCH SYLVIA COME HERE AN LET'S SHOW THEE TO THIS YOUNG FELLOW SYLVIA CAME FORWARDS RUDDY AS ANY ROSE
SUDDENLY A LIGHT SHONE DOWN INTO PHILIP'S MIND HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED AS HE SPOKE NEXT
BUT IT MUST BE SO COLD SAID SYLVIA
BUT NOT FOR LONG FOR BELL SUDDENLY STARTING UP DID ALL BUT TURN HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE IT WAS LATE SHE SAID
AND ALL THE MODIFICATION ON THIS POINT WHICH HIS JUDGMENT COULD OBTAIN FROM HIS IMPETUOUS AND EXCITED HEART WAS THAT HE WOULD WATCH HER WORDS AND MANNER WELL WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS APPROACHING ABSENCE AND IF IN THEM HE READ THE SLIGHTEST TOKEN OF TENDER REGRETFUL FEELING
AND WAS PUBLICLY DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS EXCELLENT AND PHILANTHROPIC CHARACTER BUT THESE LETTERS WERE PROVOCATIVE OF ANXIETY ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS MORNING'S POST HAD BROUGHT OUT THE WRITER'S FULL NAME AND VARIOUS PARTICULARS SHOWING HIS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF DICKINSON'S AFFAIRS
HE TOLD HIS UNCLE THAT HE WAS BOUND FOR LONDON THE NEXT DAY ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE FOSTERS DANIEL WAS DEEPLY STRUCK WITH THE FACT THAT HE WAS TALKING TO A MAN SETTING OFF FOR LONDON AT A DAY'S NOTICE
YET NEVER SO MUCH AS A SHRED ON T WAS MELTED THEY DID SAY THAT SOME BESIDE OUR CAPTAIN SAW THE BLACK DEVILS DART HITHER AND THITHER QUICKER THAN THE VERY FLAMES THEMSELVES ANYHOW HE SAW THEM
ELSE NE'ER ANOTHER MAN WILL SEE HER AND I LEFT AS GOOD A CLASP KNIFE IN HER AS EVER I CLAPT EYES ON BUT WHAT A MERCY NO MAN STAYED IN HER SAID BELL WHY MISTRESS I RECKON WE A MUST DIE SOME WAY
BRUNTON SELLS CHEESE AND THAT'S NO BETTER PHILIP PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST AND TO WRITE WORD TO ROBSON WHO SATISFIED WITH HIS WILLINGNESS TO UNDERTAKE THE COMMISSION BADE HIM GO ON AND SEE IF HE COULD NOT FIND THE LASS
GREEDY AND BREATHLESS SOME ON EM IS PAST TELLING HE REPLIED AN SOME IS NOT TO BE HAD FOR T ASKING SEEING AS HOW THEY MIGHT BRING A MAN INTO TROUBLE BUT AS A SAID
AND THERE'S YON TALL FELLOW OF A COUSIN AS LOOKS BLACK AT ME
I WISH I'D SEEN HIM SAID COULSON
THOUGH OUR SHIP LAY A FORTNEET OFF GRAVESEND KINRAID NOW SEEMED IN A HURRY BUT PHILIP WAS STUNG WITH CURIOSITY TO ASCERTAIN HIS MOVEMENTS AND SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HIM I HEARD YO WERE THESE PARTS
SO THEY PARTED BUT PHILIP HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS BEFORE HIS UNCLE CALLED HIM BACK KINRAID SLOWLY LOITERING ON MEANWHILE
EVEN NOW JEREMIAH WAS ASHAMED OF THEIR WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN ONE SO GOOD HE BELIEVED THAT THE INFORMATION THEY HAD RECEIVED WOULD ALL PROVE A MISTAKE FOUNDED ON ERRONEOUS GROUNDS IF NOT A PURE INVENTION OF AN ENEMY
HE HAD NOT TAKEN TWO STEPS WHEN SHE TURNED QUICKLY TOWARDS HIM AND SAID SOMETHING
AND YET HE WAS REPROACHED FOR THE COURSE IT WAS TAKING
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK THOUGH FROM THE MONOTONOUS COURSE OF THE EVENING IT SEEMED MUCH LATER
NO NOT DEEP WINTER AND IT WERE JUNE THEM SEAS
THIS WAS NOT COMPLIMENTARY PERHAPS BUT DANIEL WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE DID NOT MIND IF HE STEPPED OVER WITH THE SAUSAGES HIMSELF WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING ELSE
NO I SHAN'T HE REPLIED SHORTLY LIKING HAS NOUGHT TO DO WITH IT AH YO KNEW NOUGHT ABOUT IT LAST NEET CONTINUED DANIEL MUSINGLY
THERE SHOULD BE NO GREAT PLEASURE IN THE CONVERSATION OF THE OTHER SEX MEN HAVE PLENTY TO SAY TO MEN WHICH IN THEIR ESTIMATION
TO LUNNON EXCLAIMED ALICE HESTER SAID NOTHING
ALMOST AS IF BESEECHING HER TO SHOW OR EXPRESS SOME SORROW AT A JOURNEY THE VERY DESTINATION OF WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WOULD BE ABSENT FOR SOME TIME TO LUNNON
STILL LESS OF RICH MEN BUT RATHER OF ARTISTS MEN OF SCIENCE AND INVENTORS PERSONS WHO HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE GOVERNMENT
DOES NOT ALL HISTORY SHOW THAT THE GREATEST MAKERS OF HERETICS AND MASTERS OF THAT CRAFT WERE JUST THESE WISE MEN FROM WHOM THE FATHER HID HIS SECRETS THAT IS THE HYPOCRITES THE PHARISEES AND LAWYERS MEN UTTERLY GODLESS AND PERVERTED
THIS WAS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE AT FIRST OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE DOCTRINE AND AFTERWARD OF THE COMPLETE DISTORTION OF IT IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT CHRIST'S TEACHING
IT APPEARS STILL MORE BRUTAL BUT THE RISING CHRISTIAN IDEAL WHICH MUST AT A CERTAIN STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT REPLACE THE HEATHEN IDEAL OF LIFE ALREADY MAKES ITS INFLUENCE FELT A DEAD TREE STANDS APPARENTLY AS FIRMLY AS EVER
TO ASSERT OF ONE'S SELF OR OF ANY BODY OF MEN THAT ONE IS OR THEY ARE IN POSSESSION OF PERFECT UNDERSTANDING AND FULFILLMENT OF CHRIST'S WORD IS TO RENOUNCE THE VERY SPIRIT OF CHRIST'S TEACHING STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THE CHURCHES AS
AND ALL THAT IS BASED ON FORCE IF THIS STANDARD ALREADY INFLUENCES SOME THE MOST IMPRESSIONABLE AND IMPELS EACH IN HIS OWN SPHERE TO ABANDON ADVANTAGES BASED ON THE USE OF FORCE THEN ITS INFLUENCE WILL EXTEND FURTHER AND FURTHER
ONE REPRESENTS PRIDE VIOLENCE SELF ASSERTION STAGNATION AND DEATH THE OTHER MEEKNESS PENITENCE HUMILITY PROGRESS AND LIFE WE CANNOT SERVE THESE TWO MASTERS WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM
WHEN IN THE WORDS OF CHRIST THAT WHICH WAS SPOKEN IN THE EAR IS PROCLAIMED FROM THE HOUSETOPS AND WHEN THE GOSPEL IS INFLUENCING EVERY SIDE OF HUMAN LIFE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CIVIC
IT BECAME THUS IT WAS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES AND SO IT WENT ON CONSTANTLY INCREASING TILL IT REACHED IN OUR DAY THE LOGICAL CLIMAX OF THE DOGMAS OF TRANSUBSTANTIATION AND THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE POPE OR OF THE BISHOPS OR OF SCRIPTURE
AND THEREFORE THE QUESTION OF BAPTIZING THE UNCIRCUMCISED COULD ONLY HAVE ARISEN AMONG MEN WHO THOUGH THEY LOVED THEIR MASTER AND DIMLY FELT THE GRANDEUR OF HIS TEACHING STILL DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TEACHING ITSELF VERY CLEARLY AND THIS WAS THE FACT
EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT THE CHRISTIAN WORLD THE SAME RULERS AND THE SAME GOVERNMENTS THE SAME ARMIES THE SAME LAW COURTS THE SAME TAX GATHERERS THE SAME PRIESTS THE SAME RICH MEN LANDOWNERS MANUFACTURERS AND CAPITALISTS AS EVER
AND THE LESS COMPREHENSIBLE THE DOCTRINE BECAME ONE CAN SEE BY THE GOSPELS THE ACTS AND THE EPISTLES HOW FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES THE NON COMPREHENSION OF THE DOCTRINE CALLED FORTH THE NEED FOR PROOFS THROUGH THE MIRACULOUS AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE
IF THE CATHOLICS ASSERT THAT THE HOLY GHOST AT THE TIME OF THE DIVISION OF THE CHURCH INTO ARIAN AND GREEK LEFT THE CHURCH THAT FELL AWAY
TO MAKE A QUEEN OF INDIA RUBBER AND WHAT GOOD TO US ARE THESE ARMIES WITH THEIR GENERALS AND BANDS AND HORSES AND DRUMS AND WHAT NEED IS THERE OF THEM WHEN THERE IS NO WAR AND NO ONE WANTS TO MAKE WAR
SEE FOOTNOTE UNDERSTANDING BY THE WORDS PASTEURS
THE GREATER OR LESS BLESSEDNESS OF A MAN
IT IS THE SAME WITH JUDGES AND PUBLIC PROSECUTORS THE JUDGES WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO JUDGE AND CONDEMN CRIMINALS CONDUCT THE PROCEEDINGS SO AS TO WHITEWASH THEM AS FAR AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE THE CONDEMNATION OF THOSE WHOM THEY WANT TO PUNISH
THE SAME PRIESTS AND ARCHBISHOPS AND CHURCHES AND SYNODS BUT IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THEY HAVE LONG AGO CEASED TO BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY PREACH AND THEREFORE THEY CAN CONVINCE NO ONE OF THE NECESSITY OF BELIEVING WHAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEMSELVES
AND WILL NOT THIS PRESUMPTION BE TRANSFORMED INTO CERTAINTY IF WE RECOGNIZE IN THE DOCTRINE UNIVERSALLY REJECTED BY THE CHURCH THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF ONE OF THE RELIGIONS OF THE PAST TO SAY THAT GNOSTICISM OR EBIONITISM
BY UNBELIEVERS IT IS REGARDED AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF MAN'S CRAVING FOR A BELIEF IN THE SUPERNATURAL WHICH MANKIND HAS NOW OUTGROWN AS AN HISTORICAL PHENOMENON WHICH HAS RECEIVED FULL EXPRESSION IN CATHOLICISM GREEK ORTHODOXY AND PROTESTANTISM
IN THE ACCOUNT OF IT THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST PRECEDES THE ASSEMBLY BUT THE BOOK OF ACTS WAS WRITTEN MUCH LATER THAN BOTH EVENTS BUT THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST TOO HAD TO BE PROVED FOR THOSE WHO HAD NOT SEEN THE TONGUES OF FIRE
WHEN THE MEN OF OUR MODERN WORLD WHO FILL OFFICES BASED UPON VIOLENCE WILL FIND THEMSELVES IN THE POSITION OF THE EMPEROR IN ANDERSEN'S TALE OF THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES
YET YOU WILL NOT FIND ANYWHERE ANYTHING
OPENLY ASSERT THIS IN THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM IT IS SAID
REALLY DEFEND THOSE THEY OUGHT TO BE ACCUSING THE LEARNED JURISTS WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS TO JUSTIFY THE VIOLENCE OF AUTHORITY ARE MORE AND MORE DISPOSED TO DENY THE RIGHT OF PUNISHMENT AND TO REPLACE IT BY THEORIES OF IRRESPONSIBILITY AND EVEN OF MORAL INSANITY
MEN WENT FURTHER AND FURTHER IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THE MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY AND REALIZED IT MORE AND MORE IN LIFE THE LONGER MANKIND LIVED THE CLEARER AND CLEARER BECAME THE MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY
SINCE EVERY THEOLOGICAL WORK DEALS WITH THE TRUE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST AS DISTINGUISHED
THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM SAYS L'EGLISE
IN THE GOSPEL CHRIST'S TEACHING IS NOT GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD IN ITS TRUE SIMPLE AND DIRECT SENSE EVEN IN THESE DAYS WHEN THE LIGHT OF THE GOSPEL HAS PENETRATED EVEN TO THE DARKEST RECESSES OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS
LIKE MY FRIEND IN THE STREET MEETING PRAY DON'T INTERFERE WITH US AND ALL THE MESSENGERS AND THOSE WHO SEND THEM TOO WILL BE OBLIGED TO FOLLOW THIS GOOD ADVICE THAT IS TO SAY
THEN THEY WILL CEASE TO BE AND ALREADY THEY ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND IT
THAT IS JUST WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN ALL CASES OF VIOLENCE THE OFFICER WAS BORED HE HAD NOTHING TO DO HE HAD BEEN PUT POOR FELLOW IN A POSITION IN WHICH HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GIVE ORDERS HE WAS SHUT OFF FROM ALL HUMAN EXISTENCE HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT SUPERINTEND AND GIVE ORDERS
MILLOWNERS AND MANUFACTURERS BUILD HOSPITALS SCHOOLS SAVINGS BANKS ASYLUMS AND DWELLINGS FOR THEIR WORKPEOPLE SOME OF THEM FORM CO OPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS IN WHICH THEY HAVE SHARES ON THE SAME TERMS AS THE OTHERS
WHICH CANNOT BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE PLACE THE SAME GENERALS AND OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS AND CANNONS AND FORTRESSES AND REVIEWS AND MANEUVERS BUT NO WAR BREAKS OUT ONE YEAR TEN TWENTY YEARS PASS BY
IN A GREATER AND GREATER ATTAINMENT OF TRUTH AND A CLOSER AND CLOSER FOLLOWING OF IT IN THE ACTS OF LIFE THERE ARE NO ACTS IN THIS DOCTRINE WHICH COULD JUSTIFY A MAN AND MAKE HIM SAVED THERE IS ONLY THE IMAGE OF TRUTH TO GUIDE HIM FOR INWARD PERFECTION IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST
ANYTHING EXCEPT IN THE ASSERTION OF THE CHURCH CAN WE FIND THAT GOD OR CHRIST FOUNDED ANYTHING LIKE WHAT CHURCHMEN UNDERSTAND BY THE CHURCH IN THE GOSPELS THERE IS A WARNING AGAINST THE CHURCH AS IT IS AN EXTERNAL AUTHORITY
WAS IN BOTH FORM AND CONTENT ABSOLUTELY NEW TO THE JEWISH WORLD IN WHICH IT ORIGINATED AND STILL MORE TO THE ROMAN WORLD IN WHICH IT WAS PREACHED AND DIFFUSED
BUT REMEMBERING THE MAGIC PROPERTY OF THE CLOTHES NO ONE VENTURES TO SAY THAT HE HAS NOTHING ON TILL A LITTLE CHILD CRIES OUT LOOK HE IS NAKED THIS WILL BE EXACTLY THE SITUATION OF ALL WHO CONTINUE THROUGH INERTIA
BUT THERE CAN BE NO OUTER SIGNS BY WHICH ONE COULD RECKON ONESELF OR ANOTHER AS A MEMBER OF THIS HOLY BODY NOR BY WHICH ONE COULD PUT ANYONE OUTSIDE IT SO THAT NO INSTITUTION HAVING AN EXTERNAL EXISTENCE CAN CORRESPOND TO THIS IDEA
FOR CATHOLICS THE CHURCH OF GOD COINCIDES WITH THE ROMAN PRIESTHOOD AND THE POPE FOR THE GREEK ORTHODOX BELIEVER THE CHURCH OF GOD COINCIDES WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT AND PRIESTHOOD OF RUSSIA SEE FOOTNOTE FOOTNOTE
BUT THEY REST ONLY ON PUBLIC OPINION AND CAN BE DESTROYED BY IT ALREADY VIOLENCE IS REGARDED FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO ARE READY TO SERVE THE GOVERNMENT IS DIMINISHING AND EVEN THE SERVANTS OF GOVERNMENT ARE ASHAMED OF THEIR POSITION AND SO
WHETHER THE CHURCHES CAN BE ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANITY IT CANNOT BE ONE SAYS THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO CAN POINT TO SUCH MEN AS CHRYSOSTOM FENELON BUTLER AND OTHERS PROFESSING THE CHRISTIAN FAITH WERE ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANITY ONE IS TEMPTED TO SAY
THE COURTIERS COME TO LOOK AT THE TAILORS WORK AND SEE NOTHING FOR THE MEN ARE PLYING THEIR NEEDLES IN EMPTY SPACE BUT REMEMBERING THE EXTRAORDINARY PROPERTY OF THE CLOTHES THEY ALL DECLARE THEY SEE THEM AND ARE LOUD IN THEIR ADMIRATION
BUT ON THE GREATER OR LESS SWIFTNESS WITH WHICH HE IS PURSUING IT
THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF LIFE HAS ALREADY ARISEN IN OUR SOCIETY AND WILL INFALLIBLY PUT AN END TO THE PRESENT ORGANIZATION OF OUR LIFE BASED ON FORCE WHEN THAT WILL BE THE CONDITION AND ORGANIZATION OF OUR SOCIETY ARE TERRIBLE
THAT IT COULD NOT BE COMPREHENSIBLE IN ITS FULL SIGNIFICANCE IT HAS BEEN ONLY BY A SUCCESSION OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS ERRORS PARTIAL EXPLANATIONS AND THE CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS OF GENERATIONS
MY ANSWER IS TO BE FOUND IN THE UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED TRUTH WHICH THE PRECEDING WORDS EXPRESS I HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAL TO THAT TRUTH FOR I GUIDED MYSELF BY IT THROUGHOUT
THAT I AM NOW ONLY SPEAKING OF WHAT I HAVE TRIED TO DO BETWEEN THE PURPOSE HINTED AT HERE AND THE EXECUTION OF THAT PURPOSE CONTAINED IN THE SUCCEEDING PAGES LIES THE BROAD LINE OF SEPARATION WHICH DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE WILL AND THE DEED
HE WAS A POLITICAL REFUGEE DEPENDENT FOR THE BREAD HE ATE ON THE MONEY HE RECEIVED FOR TEACHING LANGUAGES HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BEGGAR FROM THE STREETS AND STILL MY FATHER WOULD HAVE TREATED HIM AS THE PRINCIPAL GUEST IN THE HOUSE FOR THIS ALL SUFFICIENT REASON
DON'T INTERRUPT ME BASIL IT WAS NOBLE I COULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DID I CAN TELL YOU I SAW HE WAS MORE STRUCK BY IT THAN HE WAS WILLING TO CONFESS AN IMPRESSION HAS BEEN MADE ON HIM BY THE TURN CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE TAKEN ONLY LEAVE THAT IMPRESSION TO STRENGTHEN AND YOU'RE SAFE
I ALLOWED THE PRURIENT MISINTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PERFECTLY INNOCENT PASSAGES IN THIS BOOK TO ASSERT ITSELF AS OFFENSIVELY AS IT PLEASED WITHOUT TROUBLING MYSELF TO PROTEST AGAINST AN EXPRESSION OF OPINION WHICH AROUSED IN ME NO OTHER FEELING THAN A FEELING OF CONTEMPT
MISTER MANNION IS MY CONFIDENTIAL CLERK SIR
TO PRACTISE THE GIRLS WITH THE FOOTMAN OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IN ATTENDANCE IN GETTING INTO A CARRIAGE AND GETTING OUT AGAIN IN A LADY LIKE MANNER NO DUCHESS HAS HAD A BETTER EDUCATION THAN MY MARGARET PERMIT ME TO ASSURE YOU MISTER SHERWIN AND THEN HER KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES
I FELT SOME DIFFICULTY IN OPENING MY BUSINESS TO HIM IT WAS NECESSARY TO SPEAK HOWEVER AT ONCE I BEGAN WITH AN APOLOGY I AM AFRAID MISTER SHERWIN THAT THIS INTRUSION ON THE PART OF A PERFECT STRANGER
WITH A LOW BOW TOWARDS THE DECREPIT OLD LADY WHO HAD ONCE BEEN MY MOTHER'S GOVERNESS THEN WALKING TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WHERE THE PENNILESS ABBE WAS LOOKING OVER A BOOK IN A CORNER HE GRAVELY AND COURTEOUSLY LED THE LITTLE DEFORMED LIMPING LANGUAGE MASTER
THE NOISOME SECRET OF THAT NIGHT WHEN YOU FOLLOWED US SHALL REEK UP LIKE A PESTILENCE IN THE NOSTRILS OF YOUR FELLOW BEINGS BE THEY WHOM THEY MAY YOU MAY SHIELD YOURSELF BEHIND YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR FRIENDS I WILL STRIKE AT YOU THROUGH THE DEAREST AND THE BRAVEST OF THEM
ON ITS APPEARANCE IT WAS CONDEMNED OFF HAND BY A CERTAIN CLASS OF READERS AS AN OUTRAGE ON THEIR SENSE OF PROPRIETY CONSCIOUS OF HAVING DESIGNED AND WRITTEN MY STORY WITH THE STRICTEST REGARD TO TRUE DELICACY AS DISTINGUISHED FROM FALSE
AND THOUGH I KNEW THAT HE MUST SURELY BE FOLLOWING ME STILL I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN NEVER DISCOVERED HOW CLOSE OR HOW FAR OFF HE WAS ON MY TRACK TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT PERIOD
RATHER MORE THAN A WEEK AGO I CONTINUED I ACCIDENTALLY MET MISS SHERWIN IN AN OMNIBUS ACCOMPANIED BY A LADY OLDER THAN HERSELF MY WIFE MISSUS SHERWIN HE SAID IMPATIENTLY MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND
AFTER MARRIAGE WHEN OPPOSITION COULD NO LONGER BE OF ANY AVAIL IT WOULD BE QUITE A DIFFERENT THING WE MIGHT BE SURE OF PRODUCING SOONER OR LATER THE MOST FAVOURABLE RESULTS
THAT A PRIVATE MARRIAGE GIVES US A CHANCE FOR THE FUTURE AS OPPORTUNITIES ARISE OF GRADUALLY DISCLOSING IT MY OFFER TO YOU MAY BE MADE UNDER SOME DISADVANTAGES AND DIFFICULTIES PERHAPS
I RESISTED THE TEMPTATION TO DASH THEM AWAY WHILE THEY STILL HID HER FROM ME WHILE I COULD NOT SEE HER AGAIN IF I WOULD I TURNED FROM THE GARDEN VIEW AND LEFT THE SQUARE
WHICH THE POPULAR NOTIONS ARE FOND OF CHARACTERISING BY A STIFF STATELY CARRIAGE BY A RIGID EXPRESSION OF FEATURES BY A HARD SEVERE INTONATION OF VOICE BY SET SPEECHES OF CONTEMPT FOR POVERTY AND RAGS AND RHAPSODICAL
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE WORLD TO HAVE HAD HIS BACK TURNED BEFORE I SPOKE TO HIM AGAIN I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT MY FAMILY AND MY NAME ARE NOT UNKNOWN TO YOU MISTER SHERWIN I RESUMED
IN CONFIDENCE HOW I AM SITUATED WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSALS I HAVE MADE THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES YES YES HE BENT FORWARD AGAIN EAGERLY TOWARDS ME AS HE SPOKE
BUT THIS I DO CERTAINLY KNOW THAT I SHALL IN NO INSTANCE CHEAT HIM OUT OF HIS SYMPATHIES IN FAVOUR OF THE BAD TO THOSE PERSONS WHO DISSENT FROM THE BROAD PRINCIPLES HERE ADVERTED TO WHO DENY THAT IT IS THE NOVELIST'S VOCATION TO DO MORE THAN MERELY AMUSE THEM
AND OF THAT DEATH HE SET HIS FOOT ONCE MORE ON THE GRAVE GO WHERE YOU WILL THIS FACE OF MINE SHALL NEVER BE TURNED AWAY FROM YOU THIS TONGUE WHICH YOU CAN NEVER SILENCE BUT BY A CRIME SHALL AWAKEN AGAINST YOU THE SLEEPING SUPERSTITIONS AND CRUELTIES OF ALL MANKIND
THAT THE DECANTER TINKLED ALL THE WHILE AGAINST THE GLASS THOUGH I WANTED NOTHING I ATE AND DRANK SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY IN COMMON CONSIDERATION FOR MISSUS SHERWIN'S EMBARRASSMENT MISTER SHERWIN FILLED HIMSELF A GLASS HELD IT UP ADMIRINGLY TO THE LIGHT
YOU'RE THE VERY MAN TO ENLIGHTEN US HERE BASIL CROSS OVER AND LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO AN OLD PARIS FRIEND OF MINE MISTER BERNARD MY BROTHER YOU'VE OFTEN HEARD ME TALK BASIL OF A YOUNGER SON OF OLD SIR WILLIAM BERNARD'S WHO PREFERRED A CURE OF BODIES TO A CURE OF SOULS
WHOSE HOSTILITY HE HAD SOME PECUNIARY REASONS TO FEAR BY ACCUSING HIS DAUGHTER AS HE HAD DECLARED HE WOULD ACCUSE HER OF HAVING BEEN THE REAL CAUSE OF HER MOTHER'S DEATH AND THAT HE TOOK CARE TO GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF SINCERITY TO THE INDIGNATION WHICH HE PROFESSED TO FEEL AGAINST HER
I CAN CONSCIENTIOUSLY ASSURE YOU THAT DUTY IS NOT INVOLVED IN IT I HAVE HOWEVER ANOTHER SUGGESTION TO MAKE WHICH IS OF A POSITIVE NATURE AND WHICH I AM SURE WILL MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL IT IS THAT HER PARENTS OR SOME OF HER OTHER RELATIONS IF HER PARENTS ARE NOT ALIVE
WHOM BY THE BYE HE CALLED MANNING OR SOME SUCH NAME IN SUCH AN OUTRAGEOUS MANNER
HOW FAR I MAY FALL SHORT OF ANOTHER MAN'S STANDARD REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED HOW FAR I HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF MY OWN I KNOW PAINFULLY WELL ONE WORD MORE ON THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PURPOSE OF THE FOLLOWING PAGES IS WORKED OUT AND I HAVE DONE
OF ALL THE REST IT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS QUITE A CHILD AND WAS TOLD ME BY ONE OF MY UNCLES NOW DEAD WHO WITNESSED THE CIRCUMSTANCE HIMSELF AND ALWAYS MADE A GOOD STORY OF IT TO THE END OF HIS LIFE A MERCHANT OF ENORMOUS WEALTH
IT HAD BEEN LEFT FOR ME TO WATCH HER DYING MOMENTS IT WAS LEFT FOR ME TO BESTOW ON HER REMAINS THE LAST HUMAN CHARITY WHICH THE LIVING CAN EXTEND TO THE DEAD IF I COULD HAVE LOOKED INTO THE FUTURE ON OUR FATAL MARRIAGE DAY
I THOUGHT OF WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED AND MIGHT YET SUFFER FOR MY SAKE AND THE LONGING TO SEE HER ONCE MORE THOUGH ONLY FOR AN INSTANT STILL KEPT ME LINGERING NEAR THE HOUSE AND LOOKING UP VAINLY AT THE LONELY WINDOWS IT WAS A BRIGHT COOL AUTUMNAL MORNING
HIS WIFE TO WHOM HE OFFERED NOTHING LOOKED AT HIM ALL THE TIME WITH THE MOST REVERENTIAL ATTENTION YOU ARE TAKING NOTHING YOURSELF MISSUS SHERWIN I SAID
I MUST ALSO BEG YOU TO SUSPEND YOUR JUDGMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE HEARD ME TO THE END YOU MAY BE DISPOSED TO VIEW TO VIEW
ON THE BARE CHANCE THAT YOU MIGHT EXERCISE SOME TRANQUILLISING INFLUENCE AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU FEAR INFECTION OR FOR ANY PRIVATE REASONS INTO WHICH I HAVE NEITHER THE RIGHT NOR THE WISH TO INQUIRE FEEL UNWILLING TO TAKE THE COURSE I HAVE POINTED OUT
HE ATTEMPTED TO GO ON TUESDAY LAST WHEN I BELIEVE HE FIRST RECEIVED INFORMATION OF THE YOUNG WOMAN'S SERIOUS ILLNESS BUT WAS SEIZED WITH A VIOLENT ATTACK OF GIDDINESS ON ATTEMPTING TO WALK AND FELL DOWN JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF THE WARD
I WARN YOU TO LOOK SHARPLY AFTER HIM WHEN HE LEAVES THE HOSPITAL EITHER THERE HAS BEEN MADNESS IN HIS FAMILY OR HIS BRAIN HAS SUFFERED FROM HIS EXTERNAL INJURIES LEGALLY HE MAY BE QUITE FIT TO BE AT LARGE
I HAD NO NEED TO PUT MY BROTHER'S READY KINDNESS IN HELPING ME TO THE TEST I STOOD ALONE BY THE GRAVE MISTER BERNARD HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF ME THE WORKERS AND THE IDLERS IN THE CHURCHYARD HAD ALIKE DEPARTED THERE WAS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THEM
THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH I HAVE OBTAINED INFORMATION OF HER RESIDENCE ARE OF THE MOST MELANCHOLY NATURE
THOSE WORDS FORMED PART OF THE ORIGINAL INTRODUCTION TO THIS NOVEL I WROTE THEM NEARLY TEN YEARS SINCE AND WHAT I SAID THEN I SAY NOW BASIL WAS THE SECOND WORK OF FICTION WHICH I PRODUCED
HE SAID INDIGNANTLY WHAT IS THERE TO CRY ABOUT
MISSUS SHERWIN COUGHED A VERY WEAK SMALL COUGH HALF STIFLED IN ITS BIRTH
HE ONLY MENTIONED HIS DAUGHTER TO DECLARE IN TERMS ALMOST OF FURY THAT HE WOULD ACCUSE HER BEFORE HIS WIFE'S SURVIVING RELATIVES OF HAVING BEEN THE CAUSE OF HER MOTHER'S DEATH AND CALLED DOWN THE MOST TERRIBLE DENUNCIATIONS ON HIS OWN HEAD IF HE EVER SPOKE TO HIS CHILD AGAIN
BUT IF YOU DESTROY IT BY STAYING HERE AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND KEEPING CLARA IN THIS NEW DILEMMA MY DEAR FELLOW YOU DESTROY YOUR BEST CHANCE THERE IS A SORT OF DEFIANCE OF HIM IN STOPPING THERE IS A DOWNRIGHT CONCESSION TO HIM IN GOING AWAY I WILL GO RALPH
TO THOSE PERSONS I SHOULD CONSIDER IT LOSS OF TIME AND WORSE TO OFFER ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION OF MY MOTIVES THAN THE SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION WHICH I HAVE GIVEN ALREADY I DO NOT ADDRESS MYSELF TO THEM IN THIS BOOK AND SHALL NEVER THINK OF ADDRESSING MYSELF TO THEM IN ANY OTHER
FEELING MY POSITION TO BE A DIFFICULT ONE I SUGGESTED THAT THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN HAD BETTER BE CALLED BUT THE DELAY DOCTOR URGED THE FRIENDS NO HARM WILL RESULT FROM IT BE ASSURED I REPLIED
AND ALSO FOR A FRESH FLY BLISTER FOUR INCHES BY NINE I LOOKED INTO THE FACE OF DOCTOR S WITH SURPRISE IT WAS PERFECTLY GRAVE AND EARNEST I HINTED TO HIM MY DOUBT OF THE GOOD THAT MODE OF TREATMENT WOULD DO
BLAKE SAID NOTHING THINKING IT POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT BUT HE REMAINED NEAR REDMOND TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO REPEAT THE INSULT IF SUCH HAD BEEN HIS INTENTION
WE HAVE CONVERSED THIS MORNING WITH SEVERAL WHO WERE PRESENT AND ALL SAY THAT THEY OBSERVED NOTHING OUT OF THE WAY IN MISTER MANLIUS ON THE OCCASION OF WHICH YOU SPEAK THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER AND WE SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR AUTHORITY FOR A STATEMENT
IS ONLY FAIR TO SAY HOWEVER THAT SUCH SPIRITUOUS INDULGENCES WERE NOT OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE IT WAS MORE THE PRINCIPLE OF THE THING AS HE SAID THAT HE STOOD UPON THAN ANY THING ELSE THAT PREVENTED HIS SIGNING A TEMPERANCE PLEDGE
HADN'T WE BETTER SEND FOR THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED THE WIFE JUST THEN THE EYES OF H OPENED AND HE LOOKED WITH HALF STUPID SURPRISE FROM FACE TO FACE OF THE ANXIOUS GROUP THAT SURROUNDED THE BED
THREATENED WITH APOPLEXY I SUPPOSE HE THEN SAID INTERROGATIVELY YES DEAR REPLIED HIS WIFE
A MAN MAY TRY TO BE A GENTLEMAN AS MUCH AS HE PLEASES BUT IF HE DON'T TRY TO PAY HIS TAILOR'S BILL AT THE SAME TIME HE TRIES IN VAIN YOU MAY BE RIGHT ENOUGH REMARKED BRIARLY A GOOD DEAL AMUSED AT THE TAILOR'S MODE OF ESTIMATING A GENTLEMAN
BESIDES SUNDRY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD COME AS THE MINISTER'S FRIENDS OR ACCUSERS PERKINS WHO HAD PUT THE REPORT IN CIRCULATION WAS THERE AT THE SPECIAL REQUEST OF ONE OF THE DEACONS WHO HAD ASCERTAINED THAT HE HAD AS MUCH OR A LITTLE MORE TO SAY IN THE MATTER THAN ANY ONE
NO NOR A DUCK GUN WITH TRUMPET MUZZLE BUT AN INFERNAL PEN A WHAT
AND PRAY UPON WHAT AUTHORITY UPON THE AUTHORITY OF YOUR OWN WORDS NEVER BUT YOU DID TELL ME SO PERKINS WAS MUCH EXCITED WHEN ON THE DAY AFTER THE DINNER PARTY DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
SUCH A HOLDING OF SIDES AND VIBRATION OF BODIES AS FOLLOWED THIS UNEXPECTED SPEECH IN THE MIDST OF THE CONFUSION AND NOISE PERKINS QUIETLY RETIRED HE HAS BEEN KNOWN EVER SINCE IN THE VILLAGE MUCH TO HIS CHAGRIN AND SCANDALIZATION
HADN'T HE BETTER BE BLED DOCTOR ASKED THE ANXIOUS WIFE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS NECESSARY I REPLIED I THINK IF WE LET HIM ALONE IT WILL PASS OFF IN THE COURSE OF A FEW HOURS A FEW HOURS
IT IS NO MATTER OF SURPRISE THAT ERE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE GENTLEMAN'S PREMONITORY SYMPTOMS WHICH HAD EXPERIENCED A TEMPORARY ABATEMENT ASSUMED A MORE ALARMING CHARACTER
SO HE INQUIRED OF THE HOTEL KEEPER WHERE HE COULD FIND A GOOD PHYSICIAN ONE OF YOUR BEST SAID HE WITH AN EMPHASIS IN HIS TONES THAT SHOWED HOW IMPORTANT WAS THE MATTER IN HIS EYES
I FOUND HIM LYING UPON THE FLOOR WHERE HE HAD TO ALL APPEARANCE FALLEN SUDDENLY FROM HIS CHAIR HIS FACE IS PURPLE AND THOUGH HE BREATHES IT IS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY I WENT UP TO SEE MY PATIENT
SO INJURIOUS TO THE REPUTATION OF THE MINISTER AND THE CAUSE OF RELIGION MY AUTHORITY IS MISTER BURTON WHO WAS PRESENT DID HE TELL YOU THAT MISTER MANLIUS WAS INTOXICATED
BY NO MEANS FOUNDED THEREON HIS CLAIM TO BE CALLED A GENTLEMAN HE NEVER LIKED L BECAUSE HE SAW THAT HE HAD NO PRINCIPLE WHATEVER THAT ALL ABOUT HIM WAS MERE SHAM THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT HE WAS HARDLY CIVIL TO HIM
IN HALF AN HOUR HE WAS PRODUCED AS HE ENTERED THE GRAVE ASSEMBLY HE LOOKED AROUND WITH GREAT COMPOSURE UPON THE ARRAY OF SOLEMN FACES AND EYES INTENTLY FIXED UPON HIM HE DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST ABASHED
THOUGH A CLOSE OBSERVER COULD SEE A SLIGHT TWITCHING IN THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH AND A SLIGHT TWINKLE IN THE CORNER OF HIS EYE MY HONOUR IS IN PAWN AND WILL REMAIN SO UNTIL I PAY THESE BILLS
A VERY WARM ADVOCATE OF TEMPERANCE AND A MEMBER OF A DIFFERENT DENOMINATION FROM THAT IN WHICH MISTER MANLIUS WAS A MINISTER AND SAID TO HIM WITH MOCK GRAVITY WE HAD A RARA AVIS AT OUR DINNER PARTY YESTERDAY PERKINS INDEED WHAT WONDERFUL THING WAS THAT
BUT HE SPOKE CONFIDENTLY OF THE RESULT AND SAID THAT IT WOULD NOT ONLY CURE THE DISEASE BUT HE BELIEVED
WON'T HE AND THE LIEUTENANT'S FACE BRIGHTENED THEN I'LL POST HIM FOR A COWARD THAT'LL FINISH HIM ALL WOMEN HATE COWARDS I'LL POST HIM YES AND COWHIDE HIM IN THE BARGAIN IF NECESSARY
SUNDRY WERE THE ATTACKS BOTH OPEN AND SECRET TO WHICH THE REVEREND MISTER MANLIUS WAS SUBJECTED AND MANY WERE THE DISCUSSIONS INTO WHICH HE WAS DRAWN BY THE ADVOCATES OF TOTAL ABSTINENCE HIS MODE OF ARGUMENT WAS VERY SUMMARY
IT WOULD DEGRADE HIM TO FIGHT WITH A TAILOR REPLIED THE MAN OF SHEARS SO I MAY SPEAK MY MIND WITH IMPUNITY BUT IF HE SHOULD CHALLENGE ME I WILL REFUSE TO FIGHT HIM ON THE GROUND THAT HE IS NO GENTLEMAN
NOT QUITE SO PREPOSTEROUS AS YOU MAY THINK MISTER B HAS MORE THAN INSINUATED THAT MISTER REDMOND IS NO GENTLEMAN FOR THIS HE IS CHALLENGED TO A SINGLE COMBAT THAT IS TO PROVE HIM TO BE A GENTLEMAN OR NOT ONE
I DID WAS THE UNHESITATING ANSWER WERE YOU PRESENT AT MISTER REESIDE'S NO SIR DID YOU SEE MISTER MANLIUS COMING FROM THE HOUSE INTOXICATED NO WHAT EVIDENCE THEN HAVE YOU OF THE TRUTH OF YOUR CHARGE
YOU MUST FIGHT APOLOGIZE OR BE POSTED THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE TO BE POSTED WON'T DO THE LAUGH WOULD BE TOO STRONGLY AGAINST YOU IT WILL BE AS BAD AND EVEN WORSE TO FIGHT AS HE PROPOSES TRUE
FOR IF YOU DO I WILL NOT STOOP TO ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE RETURNED BRIARLY I WILL CONSIDER IT PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE NO GENTLEMAN I KNOW PATTERSON VERY WELL AND WILL IN THE MEAN TIME INFORM MYSELF ON THE SUBJECT
OH YES PERFECTLY THAT YOU HAD A DRUNKEN MINISTER AT DINNER NO I NEVER SAID THAT BUT YOU DID I CAN BE QUALIFIED TO IT I SAID WE HAD A TIPSY PARSON AND PRAY
TO BECOME IS NOT PERHAPS WHAT IS AIMED AT SO MUCH AS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE GENTLEMEN FOR IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO INSINUATE ANY THING TO THE CONTRARY NO MATTER HOW WIDE FROM THE MARK THEY GO
NO OF COURSE NOT THE FELLOW'S A FOOL THEN YOU CONSENT TO BE POSTED HOW WILL THAT SOUND I'LL CUT OFF THE RASCAL'S EARS IF HE DARE DO SUCH A THING THAT WON'T SECURE MARY CLINTON THE CAUSE OF THIS CONTEST HANG IT NO
I DID NOT CALL AGAIN BUT I HEARD FROM DOCTOR S THE RESULT AFTER WE LEFT THE FRIENDS STOOD ANXIOUSLY AROUND THE BED UPON WHICH THE SICK MAN LAY
I KNOW AND YOU ARE AFRAID TO MEET THE MAN YOU HAVE CHALLENGED UPON THE TERMS HE PROPOSES THAT IS ALL PLAIN AND SIMPLE ENOUGH THE WORLD WILL UNDERSTAND IT ALL BUT WHAT IS TO BE DONE
WAS AFFECTED IN A HIGH DEGREE THE BARBER CAME THE HEAD OF H WAS SHAVED AND DOCTOR S APPLIED THE BLISTER WITH HIS OWN HANDS WHICH COMPLETELY COVERED THE SCALP FROM FOREHEAD TO OCCIPUT
YOU WERE AT MISTER REESIDE'S LAST WEEK AT A DINNER PARTY I BELIEVE SAID THE PRESIDING DEACON I WAS DID YOU SEE MISTER MANLIUS INTOXICATED ON THAT OCCASION MISTER MANLIUS GOOD HEAVENS NO
WHAT THEN IT MUST BE MADE UP SOMEHOW OR OTHER SO I THINK WILL YOU WRITE AN APOLOGY
MY WORD FOR IT THIS WILL DO THE BUSINESS FOR HIM
LET IT REMAIN ON FOR TWO HOURS AND THEN MAKE USE OF THE ORDINARY DRESSING SAID DOCTOR S IF HE SHOULD NOT RECOVER DURING THE ACTION OF THE BLISTER DON'T FEEL UNEASY SENSIBILITY WILL BE RESTORED SOON AFTER
I AM ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY PUNISHED FOR MY FOLLY PRESCRIBE FOR ME ONCE MORE AND BE ASSURED THAT I WILL NOT AGAIN PLAY THE FOOL
IF YOU INTEND PUSHING YOUR WAY INTO THE GOOD GRACES OF MY LADY MARY CLINTON YOU MUST DO SOMETHING MORE THAN FUME ABOUT THE LITTLE MATTER OF RIVALRY THAT HAS SPRUNG UP YES BUT TO THINK OF A POOR MILK SOP OF AN AUTHOR AUTHOR PAH
HE MAY DIE IN HALF AN HOUR I DON'T THINK THE CASE IS SO DANGEROUS MADAM APOPLEXY NOT DANGEROUS I HARDLY THINK IT APOPLEXY I REPLIED PRAY WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS DOCTOR
OF THE MATTER AS RELATED TO THREE OR FOUR YOUNG BUCKS IN AN OYSTER HOUSE WHERE THEY HAPPENED TO MEET HIM L WAS OF THE NUMBER A PATCH ON YOUR ELBOW TOM AS I LIVE SAID ONE AND HERE'S ANOTHER ON YOUR VEST WHY
A MODEL THAT CAUSED HER TO DRAW BUT LITTLE WATER AND ENABLED HER TO RUN FREE OVER A SANDBAR OR INTO AN INLET WHERE AN ORDINARY SHIP'S LONG BOAT WOULD HAVE GROUNDED SHE WAS VERY LONG AND SHARP WITH GRACEFUL CONCAVE LINES
HAVING TREMENDOUS SQUARE YARDS ENABLING THE CANVASS TO ACT MORE IMMEDIATELY UPON THE HULL INSTEAD OF OPERATING AS A LEVER ALOFT AND KEEPING THE SHIP CONSTANTLY OFF AN EVEN KEEL
THAT YOU ACCEPT MY WORD OF HONOR TO OBEY YOUR DIRECTIONS AS A PRISONER BUT THAT YOU SHALL NOT BIND MY ARMS OR CONFINE ME OTHERWISE HAVE YOUR OWN WAY REPLIED THE ENGLISHMAN DOGGEDLY BUT GIVE UP YOUR WEAPONS
AND WHEN WE PROPOSED TO TAKE HIM TO SEA WITH US HE READILY AGREED AND SURE ENOUGH HE SAILED IN THE SEA LION WELL HEAVE AHEAD BILL SAID ONE OF THE GROUP AS THE NARRATOR STOPPED TO STOVE A FRESH INSTALMENT OF THE VIRGINIA WEED IN HIS LARBOARD CHEEK
LIKE HER WITH WHOM PROVIDENCE HAD SO OPPORTUNELY THROWN HIM TO REFORM HIM ALTOGETHER OF THOSE ROUGHER IDEAS WHICH HE HAD NATURALLY IMBIBED IN THE COURSE OF HIS PERILOUS AND DARING PROFESSION IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT FAIR AND PURE MINDED GIRL HE WAS AS A CHILD
AND THUS HE HAD STILL REMAINED TO THE PRESENT TIME THOUGH WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE PLAN OF OPERATION FORMED UNTIL HE AVAILED HIMSELF OF MAUD'S PROPOSAL WHY BLESS ME MY CHILD
AND THE NATIVE POWER OF HER BOSOM FOR REVENGE SEEMED TO BE NOW THE FOOD UPON WHICH SHE SUSTAINED LIFE ITSELF TAKING HER LONELY PLACE IN THE CABIN AFTER THE CONVERSATION JUST REFERRED TO SHE AGAIN HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS
AND GAFF TOP GALLANTSAIL IN THEIR PLACE WHILE THE VESSEL STILL HELD ON HER COURSE A MOMENT LATER AND THE ROYAL TOP GALLANTSAIL TOPSAIL AND MAINSAIL DISAPPEAR FROM THE MAIN MAST
THEY FOUND THE ENTIRE FAMILY AROUSED AND ON THE WATCH THE HEAVY EXPLOSION OF THE SEA WITCH'S MAGAZINE HAVING SEEMED TO THEM LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE DON LEONARDO WHO SHREWDLY SUSPECTED THE TRUTH
THAT A SEVERE GALE OF WIND WAS GATHERING AND ITS FORCE WAS MOMENTARILY MORE POWERFULLY EXERCISED UPON THE VESSEL SHE STAGGERS UNDER IT MISTER FAULKNER SAID HIS SUPERIOR WITH A CALMNESS THAT EVINCED PERFECT SELF RELIANCE AND COOLNESS
HAD NOT AT ONCE GONE ON BOARD THE VESSEL OF THEIR SOVEREIGN WHICH LAY IN THE HARBOR AND BEEN CARRIED UPON THEIR DESTINATION FROM THE OUTSET CAPTAIN BRAMBLE HAD RESOLVED NOT TO LET HIS RIVAL SLIP THROUGH HIS FINGERS BY LEAVING PORT HIMSELF
AND LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF VOICES WHICH HAVE A STRANGE AND ECHO LIKE SOUND IN THAT WILD AND TANGLED SPOT HARK THOSE VOICES ARE NOT FROM THE TONGUES OF NATIVES THAT IS ENGLISH WHICH THEY SPEAK
AND NOW AND THEN A DAMP PUFF AND LULL THAT WERE TOO SIGNIFICANT TOKENS FOR A SEAMAN TO DISREGARD CAPTAIN RATLIN JUMPED UPON THE INNER BRACES OF THE TAFFRAIL AND SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HANDS FOR A MOMENT LOOKED STEADILY TO WINDWARD
AND SO DID NOT ENDEAVOR BY IMPORTUNITY TO GATHER ANYTHING FURTHER FROM HIM SO THE CONVERSATION GRADUALLY CHANGED INTO SOME OTHER CHANNEL IN THE MEANTIME WHILE THE CREW GATHERED ABOUT BILL MARLINE WERE THUS SPECULATING THE VESSEL BOWLED ALONG GRACEFULLY
I NEVER SEED A BETTER SEAMAN OF TWICE HIS YEARS ALWAYS SAVIN PRESENT COMPANY MESSMATES IN COURSE BILL GROWLED THREE OR FOUR OF HIS MESSMATES HEARTILY WELL DO YE SEE MESSMATES WE CONTINUED TOGETHER IN THE SAME SHIP FOR THE MATTER OF FIVE YEARS
AND WOULD ONLY HAVE REJOICED HAD SHE BELIEVED HE WAS BLOWN TO ATOMS WITH HIS VESSEL BY THE WILD EXPLOSION WHICH HAD SO LATELY SHAKEN THE VERY EARTH UPON WHICH SHE NOW STOOD IT WAS PLAIN THAT UP TO THIS VERY MOMENT HOWEVER
A LOOK AS THOUGH HIS HEART WAS FAR DISTANT FROM THE SCENE ABOUT HIM AND YET A HABIT OF WATCHFUL CAUTION SEEMED EVER AND ANON TO RECALL HIS SENSES AND HIS QUICK KEEN GLANCE WOULD RUN OVER THE CRAFT FROM STEM TO STERN WITH A SEARCHING AND COMPREHENSIVE POWER
HIS THOUGHTS WERE FULL OF TOO PURE AN OBJECT TO PERMIT HIM TO PARTICIPATE TO ANY EXTENT IN SO QUESTIONABLE A BUSINESS GLADLY WOULD HE AT ANY MOMENT HAVE THROWN UP HIS CHARGE OF THE SEA WITCH AND HE HAD INDEED PROMISED MISS HUNTINGTON
BUT THE WILLING CRAFT DOES ALL SHE CAN SIR I DON'T KNOW MISTER FAULKNER WE CAN MAKE HER DO ALMOST ANYTHING BUT TALK ADDED THE MATE AY SHE WILL DO THAT IN HER OWN WAY AND ELOQUENTLY TOO CONTINUED HIS SUPERIOR
BUT WHEN HE RAISED HIS EYES TO HER FACE AND DETECTED THAT TEAR A THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT RAN THROUGH HIS BRAIN A FAINT SHADOW OF HOPE THAT PERHAPS SHE LOVED HIM OR MIGHT AT SOME FUTURE TIME DO SO
COULD HAVE BEEN THE ACTUATING MOTIVE IN THUS GIVING TO THE SEA WITCH A DOUBLE CHARACTER IN HER RIG FOR THOUGH TEMPORARY AND SOMEWHAT IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE COULD AT TIMES BE THUS GAINED
WHO WERE FITTING COMPANIONS FOR EACH OTHER BUT THEY HAD NOT AS YET BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER BY ANY CHANCE SO AS TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER WE REFER TO CAPTAIN BRAMBLE AND MAUD THE QUADROON BOTH NOW HATED CAPTAIN RATLIN
AND PREPARING IT IN SUITABLE FORM FOR CAULKING THE SHIP'S SEAMS ONE OF THEIR NUMBER WAS SPINNING A YARN
CAPTAIN WILL RATLIN SEIZE HIM MY MEN SEIZE HIM AND BIND HIS ARMS HE IS OUR PRISONER SAID THE ENGLISH OFFICER BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU GIVE SUCH AN ORDER AS THAT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE ASKED THE YOUNG COMMANDER IN THE QUEEN'S NAME SIR
HAVE I EVER WRONGED YOU OR YOUR FATHER ASKED CAPTAIN RATLIN REPROACHFULLY DO YOU NOT LOVE THAT WHITE FACED GIRL YOU BROUGHT HITHER AND IF I DID MAUD WHAT WRONG IS THAT TO THEE DID I PROMISE THEE LOVE
THERE IS MY HAND ON SO HONORABLE A RESOLUTION SAID MISS HUNTINGTON FRANKLY WHILE A SINGLE TEAR OF PLEASURE TREMBLED IN HER CLEAR LUSTROUS EYES THE YOUNG COMMANDER TOOK THE HAND RESPECTFULLY THAT WAITS EXTENDED TO HIM
IT WAS NATURAL FOR A HEART SO VILE AS HIS TO COUPLE EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE AND CONNECTION IN SOME SUCH SELFISH SPIRIT WITH HIMSELF IT WAS LIKE HIM MAUD HE SAID TO HER ONE DAY WELL SHE ANSWERED
AIDED BY THAT GAUDY PAINTER AND FANCY COLORER HOPE HAD CONJURED UP BEFORE HIS MIND'S EYE BUT THE REVERSE SIDE OF THE PICTURE WAS AT HAND AND NOW HE PAUSED TO ASK HIMSELF SERIOUSLY CAN THIS BE
AND SOMEHOW I GOT RATHER MORE GROG ABOARD THAN I COULD STOW AND WHEN I CAME OFF THE CAPTAIN SWORE AT ME LIKE A PIRATE AND AFTER I GOT SOBER TRICED ME UP TO THE MAIN RIGGING FOR A ROUND DOZEN
THAT IS WHAT I WOULD REVEAL TO YOU I WILL DISCOVER TO YOU HIS SHIP IF YOU SWEAR TO ARREST HIM SEIZE THE VESSEL AND IF POSSIBLE HANG HIM YOU ARE BITTER INDEED SAID THE OFFICER
TRIFLES LIGHTER THAN STRAWS ARE LEVERS IN THE BUILDING UP OF DESTINY CAPTAIN RATLIN TURNED FROM THAT BRIEF INTERVIEW WITH A FEELING HE HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED THE IDEA THAT MISS HUNTINGTON REALLY CARED FOR HIM
HERE IT IS AGAIN ADDED THE MATE AS THE WIND HAULED ONCE MORE THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF THE CHANGE IN THE VESSEL'S RIG WHICH WE HAVE DESCRIBED WAS AT ONCE APPARENT ENABLING THE VESSEL TO LIE NEARER THE WIND IN HER COURSE
WHILE HE REGARDED THE INCREASING GALE AY SIR YOU CAN DRIVE HER AT ALMOST ANY SPEED ANSWERED THE MATE SHE'S LIKE A METTLED COURSER SIR AND LOVES THE FLEET TRACK SCUD WHILE YOU CAN MISTER FAULKNER IT'S A TRUE NAUTICAL RULE
QUICKLY REDUCED TO HER MAINSAIL FORESAIL AND FORETOPSAIL WHILE SHE FLEW BEFORE THE ON COMING GALE AT THE RATE OF SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN KNOTS AN HOUR
CAPTAIN BRAMBLE NOW SAW EVIDENT TOKENS OF A PURPOSE TO UNMOOR THE VESSEL AND LET HER DRIFT OUT INTO THE RIVER WHICH WOULD AT ONCE PLACE HER BEYOND HIS REACH AS HE HAD NO BOATS WITHIN A LEAGUE OF THE SPOT AND THEREFORE HE RESOLVED UPON A SECOND ONSLAUGHT
BEING MORE THAN ONCE STARTLED BY THE GROWL OF SOME WILD ANIMAL WHOSE HAUNTS THEY DISTURBED IT WAS WEARY STRUGGLING BY THIS PATH THROUGH THE WOOD BUT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO APPROACH THE DESIRED POINT BY LAND MAUD HESITATED NOT
AS SHE CAME IN AND SURPRISED HER GAZING OUT AT A WINDOW VACANTLY
NO HE HAD NOT RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD THE QUADROON IT WAS NOT WOUNDED PRIDE
AND BOTH AGREED TO ABIDE STRICTLY BY IT BUT DOUBTED NOT THAT AS CAPTAIN RATLIN HAD NOT BEEN ENGAGED IN ANY SLAVE COMMERCE AND INDEED HAD NOT BEEN IN THE LATE ACTION AT ALL THAT HE WOULD BE VERY SOON LIBERATED AND FREE TO CHOOSE HIS OWN CALLING
YOU ARE AN ENGLISH OFFICER AGENT OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AND SENT HERE TO SUPPRESS THIS VILE TRAFFIC TRUE AND HAVE YOU SUSPECTED NOTHING SINCE YOUR VESSEL HAS BEEN HERE I SUSPECT THAT THIS CAPTAIN RATLIN IS IN SOME WAY CONNECTED WITH THE TRADE
PAY OUT OLD FELLOW THERE'S PLENTY OF SEA ROOM AND NO LAND SHARKS TO FEAR SAID ONE OF THE GROUP ENCOURAGINGLY NEVER YOU MIND MESSMATES THERE'S NOTHING LIKE KEEPING A CIVIL TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD ESPECIALLY BEING QUIET ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS ADDED BILL
FOR HE HAD NEVER ASPIRED TO ANY MORE INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP HE WOULD IGNORE THE TRADE ALTOGETHER AND THAT HE WOULD DESPATCH MISTER FAULKNER HIS FIRST OFFICER TO THE OWNERS IN CUBA WITH THE SHIP HE HAD HIMSELF TAKEN IN CHARGE
AND SO INDEED SHE WAS CONTRARY TO THE USUAL RIG OF WHAT ARE CALLED CLIPPER SHIPS HER MASTS INSTEAD OF RAKING WERE PERFECTLY UPRIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING HER TO CARRY MORE PRESS OF SAIL WHEN NEED BE AND TO HOLD ON LONGER WHEN SPEED SHOULD BE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE
THAT'S ALL RIGHT THANK YOU BUT DON'T HARNESS THE HORSE IT HAS NEVER BEEN IN HARNESS WHY HARNESS THE HORSE AND THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU LIKE SAID LUKASHKA BENDING HIS HEAD I HAVE A KUNAK
WELL I SAT HERE AND SUDDENLY SAW SOMETHING DARK ON THE OTHER SIDE I SPIED HIM WHEN HE WAS STILL OVER THERE IT WAS AS IF A MAN HAD COME THERE AND FALLEN IN STRANGE AND A PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD A GOOD SIZED PIECE COMES FLOATING
SILVERY MISTS A SIGN OF COMING MORNING GLITTERED WHITE ABOVE THE WATER AND NOT FAR FROM HIM YOUNG EAGLES WERE WHISTLING AND FLAPPING THEIR WINGS AT LAST THE CROWING OF A COCK REACHED HIM FROM THE DISTANT VILLAGE FOLLOWED BY THE LONG SUSTAINED NOTE OF ANOTHER
ON REACHING HOME TO LUKASHKA'S GREAT SURPRISE OLENIN WITH HIS OWN HANDS LED OUT OF THE SHED A HORSE HE HAD BOUGHT IN GROZNOE IT WAS NOT THE ONE HE USUALLY RODE BUT ANOTHER NOT A BAD HORSE THOUGH NO LONGER YOUNG
AND THAT THE TEREK WITH THE DRIFTING WOOD REMAINED STATIONARY AGAIN HE PEERED OUT ONE LARGE BLACK LOG WITH A BRANCH PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION THE TREE WAS FLOATING IN A STRANGE WAY RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM NEITHER ROCKING NOR WHIRLING
SAID ONE OF THE COSSACKS WHO HAD SEEN THE SKIFF OFF ADDRESSING LUKASHKA DID YOU HEAR HIM ASKING ABOUT YOU LUKASHKA RAISED HIS HEAD MY GODSON SAID LUKASHKA MEANING BY THAT WORD THE DEAD CHECHEN YOUR GODSON WON'T RISE
LEFT THE CORDON AND WENT TOWARDS THE PLACE ON THE TEREK WHERE THEY WERE TO LIE IN AMBUSH NAZARKA DID NOT WANT TO GO AT ALL BUT LUKASHKA SHOUTED AT HIM AND THEY SOON STARTED AFTER THEY HAD GONE A FEW STEPS IN SILENCE THE COSSACKS TURNED ASIDE FROM THE DITCH
WIPING THE SWEAT FROM HIS BROAD RED FACE WITH THE SLEEVE OF HIS COAT AH THERE'S A VULTURE LIVING IN THE PLANE TREE HERE UNCLE AS SOON AS NIGHT COMES HE BEGINS HOVERING ROUND SAID NAZARKA WINKING AND JERKING HIS SHOULDER AND LEG COME COME SAID THE OLD MAN INCREDULOUSLY
ONE OF THEM FESTOONED WITH WILD GRAPE VINES AND PHEASANTS ARE FLUTTERING DRIVING ONE ANOTHER ABOUT AND PERHAPS SCENTING THEIR MURDERED BROTHERS HE FELT HIS PHEASANTS EXAMINED THEM
NAZARKA ALL CURLED UP WAS ALREADY ASLEEP ERGUSHOV SAT WITH HIS LEGS CROSSED AND MOVED SLIGHTLY TO MAKE ROOM FOR LUKASHKA
OLENIN FIRED TWELVE TIMES AND KILLED FIVE PHEASANTS BUT CLAMBERING AFTER THEM THROUGH THE BRIERS HE GOT SO FATIGUED THAT HE WAS DRENCHED WITH PERSPIRATION HE CALLED OFF HIS DOG UNCOCKED HIS GUN
YOURS KILL OURS OURS SLAY YOURS IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME REPLIED THE SCOUT EVIDENTLY INVENTING AND HE SMILED SHOWING HIS WHITE TEETH AS HE JUMPED INTO THE SKIFF THE DEAD MAN'S BROTHER SAT MOTIONLESS
SAID LUKASHKA EVIDENTLY FORGETTING HIS VEXATION AND WISHING TO GET SOME ADVANTAGE OUT OF HAVING TO GIVE A PRESENT TO HIS SUPERIOR ALL RIGHT YOU MAY GO TAKE THE BODY BEYOND THE CORDON LADS SAID THE CORPORAL STILL EXAMINING THE GUN AND
HE TOO WAS A MAN HE MUTTERED EVIDENTLY ADMIRING THE CORPSE YES IF YOU HAD FALLEN INTO HIS HANDS
AS OLENIN NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THREW A RAPID GLANCE AT ALL THE COSSACKS AND THEN ABRUPTLY ASKED HIS COMPANION A QUESTION THE LATTER ANSWERED SOMETHING AND POINTED TO LUKASHKA
ABREKS SAID THE OLD MAN NO I HAVEN'T I SAY HAVE YOU ANY CHIKHIR LET ME HAVE A DRINK THERE'S A GOOD MAN I'M REALLY QUITE DONE UP
SAID A DEEP BASS VOICE CALMLY AND MOVING THE REEDS APART DADDY EROSHKA CAME UP CLOSE TO LUKE I VERY NEARLY KILLED YOU BY GOD I DID SAID LUKASHKA WHAT HAVE YOU SHOT ASKED THE OLD MAN HIS SONOROUS VOICE RESOUNDED THROUGH THE WOOD
I HAVE A HUNDRED HORSES WORTH THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED RUBLES EACH BUT THEY ARE NOT LIKE YOURS THEY ARE TROTTERS YOU KNOW BUT STILL I LIKE THE HORSES HERE BEST WELL AND DID YOU COME HERE OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL OR WERE YOU SENT SAID LUKASHKA
ALL HIS HAPPINESS AND THAT HE NEVER HAD AND NEVER WOULD LIVE SO HAPPILY ANYWHERE AS HE DID IN THIS COSSACK VILLAGE HE WAS SO FOND OF EVERYBODY AND ESPECIALLY OF LUKASHKA THAT NIGHT
AND DID NOT THINK OF OR WISH FOR ANYTHING
UNCLE EROSHKA WAS A GIGANTIC COSSACK WITH A BROAD SNOW WHITE BEARD AND SUCH BROAD SHOULDERS AND CHEST THAT IN THE WOOD WHERE THERE WAS NO ONE TO COMPARE HIM WITH HE DID NOT LOOK PARTICULARLY TALL SO WELL PROPORTIONED WERE HIS POWERFUL LIMBS HE WORE A TATTERED COAT AND
THE WINE WAS BROUGHT LUKASHKA SAT DOWN AND TOOK THE WINE BOWL GOD WILLING I'LL FIND A WAY TO REPAY YOU HE SAID FINISHING HIS WINE HOW ARE YOU CALLED
LUKASHKA STOOD UP ON THE SANDBANK LEANED OVER THE BODY AND GAVE IT A COUPLE OF SHAKES QUITE DEAD HE SHOUTED IN A SHRILL VOICE THE CHECHEN HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE HEAD HE HAD ON A PAIR OF BLUE TROUSERS A SHIRT
HE CALLED TO HIS DOG WHO HAD RUN AWAY TO FOLLOW SOME ANIMAL AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK AS IN A DESERT AND SUDDENLY HE WAS SEIZED WITH A TERRIBLE SENSE OF WEIRDNESS HE GREW FRIGHTENED
RIGHT ENOUGH IT IS AN ABREK HE THOUGHT JOYFULLY AND SUDDENLY RISING TO HIS KNEES HE AGAIN TOOK AIM
EVIDENTLY PROUD OF THE ACQUAINTANCE HE IS MY KUNAK HE IS MY NEIGHBOUR ANSWERED THE SCOUT HE'S A TRUMP AND LUKASHKA EVIDENTLY MUCH INTERESTED BEGAN TALKING TO THE SCOUT IN TARTAR PRESENTLY A COSSACK CAPTAIN
WAS LAID ON THE BANK PRESSING DOWN THE GRASS HOW YELLOW HE IS SAID ANOTHER WHERE HAVE OUR FELLOWS GONE TO SEARCH I EXPECT THE REST OF THEM ARE ON THE OTHER BANK IF THIS ONE HAD NOT BEEN A SCOUT HE WOULD NOT HAVE SWUM THAT WAY WHY ELSE SHOULD HE SWIM ALONE SAID A THIRD
AND THE LOUD VOICES OF COSSACKS APPROACHING ALONG THE BANK ON HORSEBACK AND ON FOOT ARE YOU BRINGING THE SKIFF SHOUTED LUKASHKA YOU'RE A TRUMP LUKE LUG IT TO THE BANK SHOUTED ONE OF THE COSSACKS
WELL LEND A HAND HELP THEM HE SAID TURNING TO THE COSSACKS LUKASHKA'S FACE SHONE WITH JOY AND SEEMED HANDSOMER THAN USUAL HE MOVED AWAY FROM THE CORPORAL AND HAVING PUT ON HIS CAP SAT DOWN BESIDE OLENIN
THOUGH WITHOUT KNOWING WHY HE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE AND CONFUSED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY WHEN HE TRIED TO SPEAK LUKASHKA WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE HAVE YOU A HOUSE OF YOUR OWN IN RUSSIA HE ASKED OLENIN COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM REPLYING
LIFTING HIS BACK HIGH OUT OF THE WATER AND BREATHING DEEPLY HE SWAM ACROSS THE CURRENT OF THE TEREK TOWARDS THE SHALLOWS A CROWD OF COSSACKS STOOD ON THE BANK TALKING LOUDLY THREE HORSEMEN RODE OFF TO PATROL THE SKIFF APPEARED ROUND A BEND
THE LORD BE THANKED I'VE KILLED HIM AND WHEN HE DRIFTED ONTO THE SAND BANK I COULD SEE HIM DISTINCTLY HE TRIED TO GET UP BUT COULDN'T HE STRUGGLED A BIT AND THEN LAY DOWN EVERYTHING COULD BE SEEN LOOK HE DOES NOT MOVE HE MUST BE DEAD
EVERY TIME HE CAME TO THEM EH YOU FOOL ALWAYS LYING EXCLAIMED LUKASHKA FROM THE TOWER TO NAZARKA NAZARKA WAS IMMEDIATELY SILENCED IT MUST BE WATCHED
IN A COMMANDING VOICE TO THE COSSACKS WHO RELUCTANTLY TOOK HOLD OF THE BODY OBEYING HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE THEIR CHIEF AFTER DRAGGING THE BODY ALONG FOR A FEW STEPS THE COSSACKS LET FALL THE LEGS WHICH DROPPED WITH A LIFELESS JERK
THE CLEARNESS OF EVENING WAS NOTICEABLE IN THE AIR A SENSE OF FRESHNESS CAME FROM THE WOODS THOUGH ROUND THE POST IT WAS STILL HOT THE VOICES OF THE TALKING COSSACKS VIBRATED MORE SONOROUSLY THAN BEFORE
THE MOVING MASS OF THE TEREK'S RAPID BROWN WATERS CONTRASTED MORE VIVIDLY WITH ITS MOTIONLESS BANKS THE WATERS WERE BEGINNING TO SUBSIDE AND HERE AND THERE THE WET SANDS GLEAMED DRAB ON THE BANKS AND IN THE SHALLOWS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER
PUT A SHELTER OVER HIM FROM THE SUN PERHAPS THEY'LL SEND FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO RANSOM IT IT ISN'T HOT YET SAID SOMEONE AND SUPPOSING A JACKAL TEARS HIM WOULD THAT BE WELL REMARKED ANOTHER COSSACK WE'LL SET A WATCH IF THEY SHOULD COME TO RANSOM HIM
SUDDENLY IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SUN HAD SHONE INTO HIS SOUL HE HEARD RUSSIAN BEING SPOKEN AND ALSO HEARD THE RAPID SMOOTH FLOW OF THE TEREK AND A FEW STEPS FARTHER IN FRONT OF HIM SAW THE BROWN MOVING SURFACE OF THE RIVER
THE CAPTAIN AND THE HEAD OF THE VILLAGE ENTERED THE MUD HUT TO REGALE THEMSELVES LUKASHKA VAINLY STRIVING TO IMPART A SEDATE EXPRESSION TO HIS MERRY FACE SAT DOWN WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES BESIDE OLENIN AND WHITTLED AWAY AT A STICK
WITH THE CLOTTED WOUND ON ONE SIDE OF IT WAS THROWN BACK THE SMOOTH TANNED FOREHEAD CONTRASTED SHARPLY WITH THE SHAVEN PART OF THE HEAD THE OPEN GLASSY EYES WITH LOWERED PUPILS STARED UPWARDS SEEMING TO GAZE PAST EVERYTHING
WITH NOTHING ON BUT THE WET BLUE TROUSERS HELD BY A GIRDLE OVER THE SUNKEN STOMACH WAS WELL SHAPED AND HANDSOME THE MUSCULAR ARMS LAY STRETCHED STRAIGHT OUT BY HIS SIDES THE BLUE FRESHLY SHAVEN ROUND HEAD
BLENDING IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY WIND WITH THE MOUNTAINS MOVED SLOWLY ONWARDS ITS CURVED EDGES SHARPLY DENNED AGAINST THE DEEP STARRY SKY ONLY IN FRONT OF HIM COULD THE COSSACK DISCERN THE TEREK AND THE DISTANCE BEYOND
AS IS CUSTOMARY IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND ONLY A FEW REPLIED WITH A BOW SOME AND AMONG THEM LUKASHKA ROSE AND STOOD ERECT THE CORPORAL REPLIED THAT ALL WAS WELL AT THE OUTPOSTS ALL THIS SEEMED RIDICULOUS
BUT THESE RAGGED CLOTHES AND THESE WEAPONS ARE BELTED AND WORN WITH A CERTAIN AIR AND MATCHED IN A CERTAIN MANNER NEITHER OF WHICH CAN BE ACQUIRED BY EVERYBODY AND WHICH AT ONCE STRIKE THE EYE OF A COSSACK OR A HILLSMAN LUKASHKA HAD THIS RESEMBLANCE TO A BRAVE
ALSO PLAIN THAT SHE WAS HELD BACK IN HER ADVANCE BY SOME DOUBT IN HER BECLOUDED BRAIN WE COULD SEE HER HOVER AS IT WERE AT HER END OF THE DARK PASSAGE WHILE I HELD MY BREATH AND MISTER STEELE PANTED AUDIBLY
CHAPTER TWO QUESTIONS I KNEW ALL THE CURRENT GOSSIP ABOUT MISSUS PACKARD BEFORE I HAD PARTED WITH MISS DAVIES HER STORY WAS A SIMPLE ONE BRED IN THE WEST
SHE SUDDENLY SMOOTHED HER BROW AND CATCHING UP A PIECE OF EMBROIDERY FROM THE TABLE SAT DOWN WITH IT IN HER HAND A WIFE IS NATURALLY HEART AND SOUL WITH HER HUSBAND SHE OBSERVED
THE MAN I MEAN NOT HIS WORK WELL YES HE IS VERY GOOD COMPANY OR WOULD HAVE BEEN IF IN THE WEEK HE HAS BEEN IN THE HOUSE
FOR SEVERAL YEARS A STRUGGLE HAD GONE ON BETWEEN THE TWO NEARLY MATCHED ELEMENTS IN THIS WESTERN CITY WHICH SO FAR HAD RESULTED IN SECURING HIM TWO TERMS OF OFFICE POSSIBLY BECAUSE HIS CHARACTER APPEALED TO MEN OF ALL GRADES AND VARYING CONVICTIONS
A SPECTER HER HUSBAND REPEATED WITH A SUGGESTIVE GLANCE AT THE BRILLIANT SUNSHINE IN WHICH WE ALL STOOD YES THE TONE WAS ONE OF UTTER CONVICTION
WHICH IS DESTROYING OUR HAPPINESS HER AFFECTION FOR ME IS UNDOUBTED BUT SOMETHING GOD KNOWS WHAT HAS LAID WASTE HER LIFE TO FIND AND ANNIHILATE THAT SOMETHING IS MY FIRST AND FOREMOST DUTY
WHILE SHE WITH AN EFFORT HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER MISS SAUNDERS I PUT IN MISS SAUNDERS I CAN NOT LEAVE HER ALONE IN THE HOUSE SOME ONE MUST BE THERE TO GUARD AND WATCH
I HAVE SUCH GOOD NEWS FOR YOU THE THING YOU FEARED HASN'T ANY MEANING THE HOUSE WAS NEVER HAUNTED THE SHADOWS WHICH HAVE BEEN SEEN HERE WERE THE SHADOWS OF REAL BEINGS THERE IS A SECRET ENTRANCE TO THIS HOUSE
FACT ONE FOR ME TO ESTABLISH THE WIVES OF MEN LIKE YOU MEN MUCH BEFORE THE WORLD MEN IN THE THICK OF STRIFE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL OFTEN RECEIVE LETTERS OF A VERY THREATENING CHARACTER
BUT THE CAUSE AND PURPOSE OF MY PRESENCE UNDER THIS ROOF I PAUSED TO WONDER OVER THE FACT THAT THE ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY WHO MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO RESENT MY INTRUSION MOST WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK IT MOST KINDLY AND WITH LEAST TOKEN OF SURPRISE
THE MAN HAD NO BUSINESS HERE I DID NOT RING AND I DON'T BELIEVE HE THOUGHT I DID HE MERELY WANTED TO SEE WHAT I WAS DOING AND WHETHER I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF WHY THIS CURIOSITY I HAVE NEVER ROUSED IT ANYWHERE ELSE
HE HAS NO SPEECH TO MAKE MISSUS PACKARD SEEMED TO CONSIDER FINALLY SHE SAID WHEN YOU SEE HIM TELL HIM TO LEAVE THAT EVENING FREE AND MISTER STEELE IF YOU WILL BE SO GOOD
WHAT WAS SHE HINTING AT WHAT UNDERLAY WHAT COULD UNDERLIE HER SURPRISING REMARK I GUESS YOU NEVER HEARD ABOUT THIS HOUSE SOMETHING WORTH MY KNOWING SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN MAYOR PACKARD'S FEARS AND MISSUS PACKARD'S THERE I STOPPED
TO WHAT IS ADMIRABLE IN HER SEX YOUR IDEA IS A HAPPY ONE SAID HE I CAN GIVE YOU THREE NAMES NOW THOSE OF JUDGE WHITTAKER MISTER DUMONT THE LAWYER AND THE TWO MOWRIES
IT WAS JUST BEFORE THE NOISE YOU MADE FALLING DOWN INTO THIS HOLE OUT I WAS SORRY I WANTED TO DISBURDEN MYSELF AT ONCE WELL LEAVE EVERYTHING AS IT IS I COMMANDED DESPITE THE REBELLION IN NIXON'S EYE
ASKED A VOICE DIRECTLY OVER MY SHOULDER I WHEELED ABOUT WITH A START
TO LIVE WITH THAT MOTHER'S BROTHER IN DETROIT IN DOING THIS SHE HAD WALKED INTO A FORTUNE HER UNCLE WAS A RICH MAN AND WHEN HE DIED
AND THE OTHER ON THE WALL OF THE ADJACENT HOUSE WHICH THOUGH NEAR ENOUGH TO OBSTRUCT THE VIEW WAS NOT NEAR ENOUGH TO EXCLUDE ALL LIGHT ANOTHER AND CLOSER SCRUTINY OF THE ROOM DID NOT ALTER THE FIRST IMPRESSION
IT'S A LITTLE BOX WITH MY NAME ON IT AND IT IS HIDDEN WHERE BEHIND A BRICK I LOOSENED IN THE CELLAR WALL I CAN DESCRIBE THE VERY PLACE OH YOU THINK I AM ASKING TOO MUCH OF YOU A STRANGER AND A LADY
TO DISTURB SO WHOLESOME A NATURE WHEN MY ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY A PICTURE HANGING AT THE RIGHT OF THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE NEXT HOUSE IT GAVE PROMISE OF BEING A MOST INTERESTING SKETCH AND I CROSSED OVER TO EXAMINE IT
THIS IS YOUR ROOM MISSUS PACKARD SAYS THAT IF IT IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH OR DOES NOT SEEM PLEASANT TO YOU SHE WILL FIND YOU ANOTHER ONE TO MORROW
MISSUS PACKARD IS UTTERLY DEVOID OF SUPERSTITION THAT I MADE SURE OF BEFORE SIGNING THE LEASE OF THIS OLD HOUSE BUT I FORGOT YOU ARE DOUBTLESS IGNORANT OF ITS REPUTATION IT HAS OR RATHER HAS HAD THE NAME OF BEING HAUNTED
AND THE SYMPATHY HE UNDOUBTEDLY FELT FOR HER AN EJACULATION OF IMPATIENCE LEFT HER HUSBAND'S LIPS OBLIGATIONS VERY FAR REMOVED FROM THE FANTASIES OF A DISTURBED MIND
BUT I HAVE LOVED MISS OLYMPIA AS WE USED TO CALL HER
THEY USED TO COME UP THROUGH THIS TRAP WHERE IS MISSUS PACKARD THEY WERE TOO SPEECHLESS WITH WONDER TO ANSWER ME I HAD TO REACH UP MY ARMS TWICE BEFORE EITHER OF THEM WOULD LEND ME A HELPING HAND
AND I AM OBLIGED TO GO AWAY AND LEAVE HER IN THIS STATE FOR TWO WEEKS THREE WEEKS NOW
HER RICH GOWN SOILED TO THE WIDTH OF HALF A FOOT AROUND THE BOTTOM LAY WITH CUT LACES AND ITS TRIMMINGS IN RAGS UNDER A CHAIR WHICH HAD BEEN KNOCKED OVER AND LEFT WHERE IT FELL EVEN HER JEWELS HAD NOT BEEN PUT AWAY BUT LAY SCATTERED ON THE DRESSER
WILL YOU SEE THAT AN OPPORTUNITY IS GIVEN ME FOR DOING THIS HIS ASSENT WAS AS FRANK AS ALL THE REST AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AS HE PASSED OUT I HEARD HIM REMARK TO MISS DAVIES I EXPECT MISS SAUNDERS AT MY HOUSE BEFORE NIGHTFALL
ROSE IN THE HALL AND WE HEARD UTTERED AT THE VERY DOOR MAMA BUSY MAMA SING WITH A CRY SHE SPRANG FROM THE PIANO AND BOUNDING TO THE DOOR FLUNG IT OPEN AND CAUGHT HER CHILD IN HER ARMS
THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF THE UPRIGHTNESS OF HIS MOTIVES REGARDING HIS WIFE I VENTURED ONE MORE QUESTION HOW FAR SHALL I FEEL MYSELF AT LIBERTY TO GO IN THIS ATTEMPT
HE APPEARED TO BE IMPATIENT OF EVERY UNNECESSARY WORD THIS I COULD IN A DIM SORT OF WAY UNDERSTAND HE WAS AT THE CRISIS OF HIS FATE AND SO WAS HIS PARTY
SHE HAD THROWN HERSELF DOWN AT THE PIANO AND WAS SINGING GAILY ECSTATICALLY APPROACHING HER IN UNDISGUISED WONDER AT THIS NEW MOOD I STOOD AT HER BACK AND LISTENED I DO NOT SUPPOSE
MEANWHILE HE HAD BEEN STUDYING ME WELL YOU UNDERSTAND MY POSITION HE COMMENTED WEDNESDAY NIGHT
TO THE SHOP LOOK AT THIS SHE CRIED HOLDING UP AN ARTICLE OF SUCH CHEAP WORKMANSHIP THAT I WONDERED SO SENSIBLE AN APPEARING WOMAN WOULD CUMBER HER SHELVES WITH IT I AM GLAD YOU LIVE OVER THERE
THEN DROPPING ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS SOMEWHAT IN HIS OWN GRAND MANNER I MADE THIS REMARK IF YOUR WIFE LIKES ME WHICH VERY POSSIBLY SHE MAY FAIL TO DO
NOT ONLY TO SUCH WORDS AS MUST INEVITABLY PASS BETWEEN THEM BUT TO THEIR TONES TO THE UNCONSCIOUS SIGH TO WHATEVER MIGHT BETRAY HIS FEELING TOWARD HER OR HERS TOWARD HIM CONVINCED AS I NOW WAS
HE SURVEYED ME CLOSELY FOR AN INSTANT BEFORE SPEAKING
TAKING THE EMBROIDERY FROM HER HAND SAT DOWN IN THE PLACE SHE HAD POINTED OUT I HEARD THE DEEP BREATH SHE DREW FORGOT IN AN INSTANT MY PURPOSE OF QUESTIONING HER CONCERNING NIXON AND SETTLED MYSELF TO LISTEN
HAD HE BEEN FORTUNATE OR UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HEAR HER I'M A MARRIED WOMAN MISS AND SHOULDN'T BE WORKING LIKE THIS AND I WON'T BE ALWAYS MY MAN'LL COME BACK AND MAKE A LADY OF ME AGAIN IT'S THAT I'M WAITING FOR
TILL HE RETURNED WITH THE MAYOR THEN I HEARD THE DOOR OPEN AND QUIETLY SHUT THE INTERVIEW WAS OVER WITHOUT MY HAVING FELT CALLED UPON TO SHOW MYSELF AN INTERVAL OF SILENCE AND THEN I HEARD HER VOICE
DO YOU THINK THAT IN THE EVENT OF YOUR NOT SUCCEEDING IN FORCING AN APOLOGY FROM THE MAN WHO INSERTED THAT OBJECTIONABLE PARAGRAPH AGAINST MYSELF THAT THAT SUCH HINTS OF SOMETHING BEING WRONG WITH ME
WAITING TO TAKE HER OUT THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE FELL UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM MISSUS PACKARD'S LIPS AS THE TWO DISAPPEARED BUT PRESENTLY MEETING MY EYES SHE BLUSHED AND MADE HASTE TO REMARK
AND GATHERING UP THE SLEEP FROM HER BODY CLOSED IT AGAIN IN THE BOX AND WAKED PSYCHE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH OF ONE OF HIS ARROWS AGAIN SAID HE HAST THOU ALMOST PERISHED BY THE SAME CURIOSITY
WHAT SAID SHE SHALL I THE CARRIER OF THIS DIVINE BEAUTY NOT TAKE THE LEAST BIT TO PUT ON MY CHEEKS TO APPEAR TO MORE ADVANTAGE IN THE EYES OF MY BELOVED HUSBAND SO SHE CAREFULLY OPENED THE BOX BUT FOUND NOTHING THERE OF ANY BEAUTY AT ALL
ALL WONDERED WHAT IT COULD BE FOR SOME RECOMMENDED TO TAKE IT INTO THE CITY AS A TROPHY OTHERS FELT AFRAID OF IT WHILE THEY HESITATE
AND A BASKET ON WHEELS THE BASKET WAS TO HOLD THE WOOL AND SPOOLS FOR THE QUEEN'S WORK DYER IN HIS POEM OF
THERE WERE OTHERS FILLED WITH ALL MANNER OF TREASURES AND BEAUTIFUL AND PRECIOUS PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE AND ART WHILE HER EYES WERE THUS OCCUPIED A VOICE ADDRESSED HER THOUGH SHE SAW NO ONE UTTERING THESE WORDS SOVEREIGN LADY
PURSUED BY PYRRHUS THE SON OF ACHILLES RUSHED IN WOUNDED
THE TRADITIONAL SITE OF TROY HE HAD UNCOVERED THE ANCIENT CAPITAL SCHLIEMANN EXCAVATED DOWN BELOW THE RUINS OF THREE OR FOUR SETTLEMENTS EACH REVEALING AN EARLIER CIVILIZATION
SO THEY TRAVELLED THE WHOLE DAY AND AT DUSK SKRYMIR CHOSE A PLACE FOR THEM TO PASS THE NIGHT IN UNDER A LARGE OAK TREE SKRYMIR THEN TOLD THEM HE WOULD LIE DOWN TO SLEEP BUT TAKE YE THE WALLET HE ADDED AND PREPARE YOUR SUPPER
CELEBRATING THE MARRIAGE OF THEIR DAUGHTER HERMIONE TO NEOPTOLEMUS
WHO NOURISHED HIS INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD AND FOR THEIR CARE WERE REWARDED BY JUPITER BY BEING PLACED AS THE HYADES AMONG THE STARS WHEN BACCHUS GREW UP HE DISCOVERED THE CULTURE OF THE VINE AND THE MODE OF EXTRACTING ITS PRECIOUS JUICE
AVENGING DEITIES SEIZED UPON ORESTES AND DROVE HIM FRANTIC FROM LAND TO LAND
AND AS THE GIANT SOON WAKED UP THOR CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SIMPLY ASKING HIS NAME MY NAME IS SKRYMIR SAID THE GIANT BUT I NEED NOT ASK THY NAME FOR I KNOW THAT THOU ART THE GOD THOR BUT WHAT HAS BECOME OF MY GLOVE
BUT NOW PERFORM EXACTLY THE TASK IMPOSED ON YOU BY MY MOTHER AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST THEN CUPID AS SWIFT AS LIGHTNING PENETRATING THE HEIGHTS OF HEAVEN PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE JUPITER WITH HIS SUPPLICATION JUPITER LENT A FAVORING EAR
SO CALLING ZEPHYR SHE ACQUAINTED HIM WITH HER HUSBAND'S COMMANDS AND HE PROMPTLY OBEDIENT SOON BROUGHT THEM ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO THEIR SISTER'S VALLEY THEY EMBRACED HER AND SHE RETURNED THEIR CARESSES COME SAID PSYCHE
WHICH SO STARTLED HIM THAT IN HIS CONFUSION HE WOUNDED HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN ARROW HEEDLESS OF HIS WOUND HIS WHOLE THOUGHT NOW WAS TO REPAIR THE MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE AND HE POURED THE BALMY DROPS OF JOY OVER ALL HER SILKEN RINGLETS
I STRUGGLED TO GET MY ARMS AT LIBERTY PANTING AND REEKING WITH PERSPIRATION
SHE AIDED THE GREEKS SECRETLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND IN PARTICULAR
BUT THOR IS LITTLE IN COMPARISON TO OUR MEN LITTLE AS YE CALL ME ANSWERED THOR LET ME SEE WHO AMONG YOU WILL COME HITHER NOW I AM IN WRATH AND WRESTLE WITH ME I SEE NO ONE HERE SAID UTGARD LOKI LOOKING AT THE MEN SITTING ON THE BENCHES
A CERTAIN KING AND QUEEN HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THE CHARMS OF THE TWO ELDER WERE MORE THAN COMMON BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNGEST WAS SO WONDERFUL THAT THE POVERTY OF LANGUAGE IS UNABLE TO EXPRESS ITS DUE PRAISE THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY WAS SO GREAT
I HAVE HEARD YOU WHISPERING TO ONE ANOTHER THAT I AM NOT A MAN OF SMALL DIMENSIONS
BROUGHT FORWARD THEIR ACCUSATION
AND THAT BRIGHT SPIRIT OF IMMORTAL BIRTH UNTIL HER PINING SOUL AND WEEPING EYES HAD LEARNED TO SEEK HIM ONLY IN THE SKIES TILL WINGS UNTO THE WEARY HEART WERE GIVEN AND SHE BECAME LOVE'S ANGEL BRIDE IN HEAVEN
THIS SHIP SHALL NOT BE PROFANED BY SUCH IMPIETY SAID I I HAVE A GREATER SHARE IN HER THAN ANY OF YOU BUT LYCABAS A TURBULENT FELLOW SEIZED ME BY THE THROAT AND ATTEMPTED TO THROW ME OVERBOARD
PLACING A LADDER AGAINST THE WALL HE MOUNTED BUT JUPITER OFFENDED AT HIS IMPIOUS LANGUAGE STRUCK HIM WITH A THUNDERBOLT WHEN HIS OBSEQUIES WERE CELEBRATED EVADNE CAST HERSELF ON HIS FUNERAL PILE AND PERISHED EARLY IN THE CONTEST
THIS AT LEAST I CAN DO TO GRATIFY YOU AND FORCE YOU TO PRAISE ME AND THUS SHALL I PROVE THAT THE LOVE OF YOU LEFT ME BUT WITH LIFE NOR WILL I LEAVE IT TO RUMOR TO TELL YOU OF MY DEATH I WILL COME MYSELF AND YOU SHALL SEE ME DIE
SHE WAS INVOKED BY PHILLIPS THE AUTHOR OF A POEM ON CIDER IN BLANK VERSE THOMSON IN THE SEASONS ALLUDES TO HIM PHILLIPS POMONA'S BARD THE SECOND THOU
I KNOW HIM AS WELL AS HE KNOWS HIMSELF HE IS NOT A WANDERING DEITY BUT BELONGS TO THESE MOUNTAINS NOR IS HE LIKE TOO MANY OF THE LOVERS NOWADAYS WHO LOVE ANY ONE THEY HAPPEN TO SEE HE LOVES YOU AND YOU ONLY
SHE MOCKED AND LAUGHED AT HIM ADDING CRUEL WORDS TO HER UNGENTLE TREATMENT AND GAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST GLEAM OF HOPE IPHIS COULD NOT ANY LONGER ENDURE THE TORMENTS OF HOPELESS LOVE AND STANDING BEFORE HER DOORS HE SPAKE THESE LAST WORDS
BUT WHY SHOULD I TELL OF OTHER PERSONS TRANSFORMATIONS WHEN I MYSELF AM AN INSTANCE OF THE POSSESSION OF THIS POWER SOMETIMES I BECOME A SERPENT AND SOMETIMES A BULL WITH HORNS ON MY HEAD
LOOKED OUT OVER THE SEA AND SAID IN A VOICE OF WEEPING SAILORS THESE ARE NOT THE SHORES YOU PROMISED TO TAKE ME TO YONDER ISLAND IS NOT MY HOME WHAT HAVE I DONE THAT YOU SHOULD TREAT ME SO
AND LET THOR WRESTLE WITH HER IF HE WILL SHE HAS THROWN TO THE GROUND MANY A MAN NOT LESS STRONG THAN THIS THOR IS A TOOTHLESS OLD WOMAN THEN ENTERED THE HALL AND WAS TOLD BY UTGARD LOKI TO TAKE HOLD OF THOR THE TALE IS SHORTLY TOLD
UTGARD LOKI ORDERED A TABLE TO BE SET FOR THEM ON WHICH THERE WAS NO LACK OF VICTUALS OR DRINK
VENUS AT THE APPROACH OF TWILIGHT RETURNED FROM THE BANQUET OF THE GODS BREATHING ODORS AND CROWNED WITH ROSES SEEING THE TASK DONE SHE EXCLAIMED THIS IS NO WORK OF YOURS WICKED ONE
THE PRISONER UNTERRIFIED RESPONDED
SCATTERED ABOUT LAY SICKLES AND RAKES AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF HARVEST WITHOUT ORDER AS IF THROWN CARELESSLY OUT OF THE WEARY REAPERS HANDS IN THE SULTRY HOURS OF THE DAY THIS UNSEEMLY CONFUSION
NOW UPON THE SURFACE NOW UNDER IT SCATTERING THE SPRAY AND SPOUTING THE WATER FROM THEIR BROAD NOSTRILS OF TWENTY MEN I ALONE WAS LEFT TREMBLING WITH FEAR THE GOD CHEERED ME FEAR NOT SAID HE STEER TOWARDS NAXOS
IT WAS THE LABOR OF MY INFANCY TO CONQUER SNAKES SO SAYING HE CLASPED MY NECK WITH HIS HANDS I WAS ALMOST CHOKED
THAT I SHOULD SAIL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND TAKE THE BOY TO EGYPT TO SELL HIM FOR A SLAVE I WAS CONFOUNDED AND SAID LET SOME ONE ELSE PILOT THE SHIP WITHDRAWING MYSELF FROM ANY FURTHER AGENCY IN THEIR WICKEDNESS THEY CURSED ME AND ONE OF THEM EXCLAIMING
THAT THE CENTAURS AND LAPITHAE QUARRELLED LOOK HOW THE CROWN WHICH ARIADNE WORE UPON HER IVORY FOREHEAD THAT SAME DAY THAT THESEUS HER UNTO HIS BRIDAL BORE
AS IF FOR A FINAL DEPARTURE THE TROJANS SEEING THE ENCAMPMENT BROKEN UP AND THE FLEET GONE CONCLUDED THE ENEMY TO HAVE ABANDONED THE SIEGE THE GATES WERE THROWN OPEN
AND THE WALLS WERE ENRICHED WITH CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS REPRESENTING BEASTS OF THE CHASE AND RURAL SCENES ADAPTED TO DELIGHT THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER PROCEEDING ONWARD SHE PERCEIVED THAT BESIDES THE APARTMENTS OF STATE
HIS STEPMOTHER I ON THE OTHER HAND SAID TO THE FATHER OF THE MAIDEN BEHOLD ME THE KING OF THE WATERS THAT FLOW THROUGH YOUR LAND I AM NO STRANGER FROM A FOREIGN SHORE BUT BELONG TO THE COUNTRY A PART OF YOUR REALM
AND AS HE SPOKE HIS MOUTH WIDENED HIS NOSTRILS EXPANDED AND SCALES COVERED ALL HIS BODY ANOTHER ENDEAVORING TO PULL THE OAR FELT HIS HANDS SHRINK UP AND PRESENTLY TO BE NO LONGER HANDS BUT FINS
THE MODE OF SPINNING WHEN THE EGYPTIAN PRINCE A GOLDEN DISTAFF GAVE THAT BEAUTEOUS NYMPH TOO BEAUTEOUS HELEN NO UNCOURTLY GIFT
VAIN THE STRUGGLE VAIN AGAINST THE COILING STRAIN AND GRIPE AND DEEPENING OF THE DRAGON'S GRASP THE OLD MAN'S CLINCH THE LONG ENVENOMED CHAIN
POLYNICES KNOWING THIS GAVE ERIPHYLE THE COLLAR OF HARMONIA
UTGARD LOKI THEN ASKED THOR IN WHAT FEATS HE WOULD CHOOSE TO GIVE PROOFS OF THAT PROWESS FOR WHICH HE WAS SO FAMOUS
AND OFTENTIMES LOUD STROKES AND RINGING SOUNDS FROM UNDER THAT DEEP ROCK MOST HORRIBLY REBOUNDS THE CAUSE SOME SAY IS THIS A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE THAT MERLIN DIED
WHEREFORE HE CAUSED HIS MISTRESS
AND ASK OF HIM TO BESTOW KNIGHTHOOD ON THEE AND WHENEVER THOU SEEST A CHURCH REPEAT THERE THY PATER NOSTER
IN SEARCH OF SUCH AN INFANT VORTIGERN SENT HIS MESSENGERS ALL OVER THE KINGDOM AND THEY BY ACCIDENT DISCOVERED MERLIN WHOSE LINEAGE SEEMED TO POINT HIM OUT AS THE INDIVIDUAL WANTED THEY TOOK HIM TO THE KING BUT MERLIN
SIR DODYNAS LE SAUVAGE SIR OZANNA SIR LADYNAS SIR PERSANT OF INDE SIR IRONSIDE AND SIR PELLEAS AND THESE TEN KNIGHTS MADE THEM READY
TELL ME GOOD LAD SAID ONE OF THEM SAWEST THOU A KNIGHT PASS THIS WAY EITHER TODAY OR YESTERDAY
TRISTRAM BELIEVED IT WAS CERTAIN DEATH FOR HIM TO RETURN TO IRELAND AND HOW COULD HE ACT AS AMBASSADOR FOR HIS UNCLE IN SUCH A CAUSE YET BOUND BY HIS OATH HE HESITATED NOT FOR AN INSTANT HE ONLY TOOK THE PRECAUTION TO CHANGE HIS ARMOR
SAILED AWAY WITH ALL SPEED FOR IRELAND AND DIED SOON AFTER ARRIVING IN HIS OWN COUNTRY THE KINGDOM OF CORNWALL WAS THUS DELIVERED FROM ITS TRIBUTE TRISTRAM WEAKENED BY LOSS OF BLOOD FELL SENSELESS
AND UNDER THE EYES OF THE FAIR CAPTIVE LAUNCELOT WAS ENFEEBLED BY HIS WOUNDS AND FOUGHT NOT WITH HIS USUAL SPIRIT AND THE CONTEST FOR A TIME WAS DOUBTFUL
AND REPAIR TO KING ARTHUR'S COURT
WHO ART THOU AND HE REPLIED
THEN THE TEN KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE DREW THEIR SWORDS AND THE OTHER PARTY RUN AT THEM WITH THEIR SPEARS
AND GREW UP IMPROVING IN EVERY GALLANT AND KNIGHTLY ACCOMPLISHMENT ADDING TO HIS SKILL IN ARMS THE ARTS OF MUSIC AND OF CHESS IN PARTICULAR HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE CHASE AND TO ALL WOODLAND SPORTS SO THAT HE BECAME DISTINGUISHED ABOVE ALL OTHER CHEVALIERS OF THE COURT
FOR HE DREADED LEST SIR LAUNCELOT SHOULD HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE THEN THE QUEEN PRIVILY CALLED UNTO HER A PAGE OF HER CHAMBER THAT WAS SWIFTLY HORSED TO WHOM SHE SAID GO THOU WHEN THOU SEEST THY TIME
BE IT AS IT MAY SAID SIR MALEAGANS KNOW YOU WELL MADAM I HAVE LOVED YOU MANY A YEAR AND NEVER TILL NOW COULD I GET YOU TO SUCH ADVANTAGE AS I DO NOW AND THEREFORE I WILL TAKE YOU AS I FIND YOU
WENT BACK TO THE COURT AND RELATED ALL THESE THINGS TO ARTHUR AND GUENEVER AND TO ALL THE HOUSEHOLD
AND EVERY KNIGHT SHALL HAVE A SQUIRE AND TWO YEOMAN AND ALL WELL HORSED FOR THUS IT CHANCED ONE MORN WHEN ALL THE COURT GREEN SUITED BUT WITH PLUMES THAT MOCK'D THE MAY HAD BEEN THEIR WONT A MAYING
BUT KNOW THOU WELL SIR GAWAIN I WILL NEVER SMITE A FELLED KNIGHT
SAID SIR GAWAIN TRULY SAID THE MAN SIR GARETH AND SIR GAHERIS ARE SLAIN ALAS SAID SIR GAWAIN NOW IS MY JOY GONE AND THEN HE FELL DOWN AND SWOONED AND LONG HE LAY THERE AS HE HAD BEEN DEAD
HAD THE SATISFACTION OF MEETING HIM THE NEXT DAY
MODRED'S NARROW FOXY FACE HEART HIDING SMILE AND GRAY PERSISTENT EYE HENCEFORWARD TOO THE POWERS THAT TEND THE SOUL TO HELP IT FROM THE DEATH THAT CANNOT DIE AND SAVE IT EVEN IN EXTREMES BEGAN TO VEX AND PLAGUE GUINEVERE
AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THOSE LANDS CAME TO SIR LAUNCELOT AND RECEIVED HIM HOME RIGHT JOYFULLY
PERCEIVED THAT A PART OF THE SWORD HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT THE MISSING PORTION WAS LIKE THAT WHICH WAS LEFT IN THE SKULL OF MORAUNT THE IRISH CHAMPION SHE IMPARTED HER THOUGHT TO THE QUEEN
AND HELD HIS LIFE IN HIS POWER THE FALLEN WARRIOR CALLED ON HIM TO USE HIS RIGHT OF CONQUEST AND STRIKE THE FATAL BLOW GOD FORBID SAID TRISTRAM THAT I SHOULD TAKE THE LIFE OF SO BRAVE A KNIGHT HE RAISED HIM UP AND RESTORED HIM TO HIS FRIENDS
TRISTRAM STILL FEEBLE FROM HIS WOUND ROSE DURING THE NIGHT TOOK HIS ARMS AND CONCEALED THEM IN A FOREST NEAR THE PLACE OF THE CONTEST AND AFTER IT HAD BEGUN MINGLED WITH THE COMBATANTS HE OVERTHREW ALL THAT ENCOUNTERED HIM IN PARTICULAR PALAMEDES
HIM WHOM THOU HAST SOUGHT SO LONG WELCOME UNTO THEE CHIEFTAIN SAID ARTHUR AND HEREUPON THERE CAME THE QUEEN AND HER HANDMAIDENS AND PERCEVAL SALUTED THEM AND THEY WERE REJOICED TO SEE HIM AND BADE HIM WELCOME
THEN SIR GAWAIN SAID SURELY IT IS UNWORTHY OF A KNIGHT TO TRAVEL IN SUCH SORT BUT SIR LAUNCELOT HEEDED HIM NOT AT NIGHTFALL
CARTS WERE LITTLE USED EXCEPT FOR CARRYING OFFAL AND FOR CONVEYING CRIMINALS TO EXECUTION BUT SIR LAUNCELOT TOOK NO THOUGHT OF ANYTHING BUT THE NECESSITY OF HASTE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESCUING THE QUEEN SO HE DEMANDED OF THE CARTER
AND WITH THIS SIR LUCAN LED THE DAMSEL TO THE KING WHERE HE SAT WITH SIR GAWAIN TO HEAR WHAT SHE WOULD SAY SO WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER TALE THE TEARS RAN OUT OF THE KING'S EYES AND ALL THE LORDS WERE FORWARD TO ADVISE THE KING TO BE ACCORDED WITH SIR LAUNCELOT SAVE ONLY SIR GAWAIN AND HE SAID
LAWAYN WITH MANY MORE AND ALL WENT TO SIR LAUNCELOT AND THEY SAID MY LORD SIR LAUNCELOT WE PRAY YOU IF YOU WILL HAVE OUR SERVICE KEEP US NO LONGER WITHIN THESE WALLS FOR KNOW WELL ALL YOUR FAIR SPEECH AND FORBEARANCE WILL NOT AVAIL YOU
AND THEN THEY CAME TOGETHER WITH ALL THEIR HORSES MIGHT AND EACH SMOTE THE OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR SHIELDS BUT NEITHER OF THEM WAS UNHORSED BUT THEIR HORSES FELL TO THE EARTH AND THEN THEY LEAPT FROM THEIR HORSES AND DREW THEIR SWORDS AND GAVE MANY SAD STROKES SO THAT THE BLOOD BURST OUT IN MANY PLACES
SPENSER REPRESENTS HIM AS THE ARTIFICER OF THE IMPENETRABLE SHIELD AND OTHER ARMOR OF PRINCE ARTHUR
AT LENGTH HIS PROGRESS WAS CHECKED BY A WIDE AND RAPID TORRENT WHICH COULD ONLY BE PASSED ON A NARROW BRIDGE ON WHICH A FALSE STEP WOULD PROVE HIS DESTRUCTION LAUNCELOT LEADING HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND MAKING HIM SWIM BY HIS SIDE
THEN SPAKE SIR BOHORT AND SAID MY LORD SIR LAUNCELOT GIVE US LEAVE TO MEET THEM IN THE FIELD AND WE SHALL MAKE THEM RUE THE TIME THAT EVER THEY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY THEN SAID SIR LAUNCELOT I AM FULL LOATH TO RIDE OUT WITH MY KNIGHTS FOR SHEDDING OF CHRISTIAN BLOOD SO WE WILL YET A WHILE KEEP OUR WALLS
DIDST THOU SEE ANY ONE COMING AFTER ME FROM THE COURT
THAT SIR PALAMEDES WAS INDUCED TO RETURN WITH HER TO LAND THAT THEY MIGHT SEE THE UNKNOWN MUSICIAN TRISTRAM WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY SEIZED THE LADY'S HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND PLUNGED WITH HER INTO THE FOREST TAUNTINGLY INFORMING HIS RIVAL THAT
AND TWO MEN HAVE BEEN BEFORE ON THIS ERRAND THAT IS TRUE SAID PERCEVAL AND UNCOURTEOUSLY THEY CAME THEY ATTACKED ME AND I WAS ANNOYED THEREAT THEN HE TOLD HIM THE THOUGHT THAT OCCUPIED HIS MIND
FOR HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THAT RELATES TO HUNTING NO WONDER THAT BELINDA THE KING'S DAUGHTER FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT AS HE DID NOT RETURN HER PASSION SHE IN A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF ANGER EXCITED HER FATHER AGAINST HIM AND HE WAS BANISHED THE KINGDOM
HE DREW NEAR TO SEE WHO IT MIGHT BE THEN SIR LAUNCELOT TOLD HIM HOW THE QUEEN HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AND HOW IN HASTENING TO HER RESCUE HIS HORSE HAD BEEN DISABLED AND HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE CART RATHER THAN GIVE UP HIS ENTERPRISE
WHO LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR OF THE RETURN OF THE RIGHTFUL HEIRS OF THE KINGDOM BEGAN TO ERECT A STRONG TOWER FOR DEFENCE THE EDIFICE WHEN BROUGHT BY THE WORKMEN TO A CERTAIN HEIGHT THREE TIMES FELL TO THE GROUND WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE
FOR THUS SHALT THOU ACQUIRE FAME YET FREELY GIVE IT TO ANOTHER FOR THUS THOU SHALT OBTAIN PRAISE IF THOU SEE A FAIR WOMAN PAY COURT TO HER FOR THUS THOU WILT OBTAIN LOVE
AND MEN SAY HE TOOK THE WATER AT WESTMINSTER BRIDGE AND MADE HIS HORSE SWIM OVER THAMES UNTO LAMBETH THEN WITHIN A WHILE HE CAME TO A WOOD WHERE WAS A NARROW WAY AND THERE THE ARCHERS WERE LAID IN AMBUSH
BUT IT IS NOT IN ROMANCE ALONE THAT WE FIND SUCH SINGULAR INSTANCES OF ADHERENCE TO AN INDEFINITE PROMISE THE HISTORY OF THE TIMES PRESENTS AUTHENTIC TRANSACTIONS EQUALLY EMBARRASSING AND ABSURD SCOTT NOTE TO SIR TRISTRAM
AND SIR LAUNCELOT CARRIED AWAY THE QUEEN TO HIS CASTLE OF LA JOYEUSE GARDE THEN THERE CAME ONE TO SIR GAWAIN AND TOLD HIM HOW THAT SIR LAUNCELOT HAD SLAIN THE KNIGHTS AND CARRIED AWAY THE QUEEN O LORD DEFEND MY BRETHREN
THERE IS THE TALL LILY IN THE FOUNTAIN THAT NODS TO THE SUN IT DRIPS IN CADENCED MONOTONE AND ITS SONG IS REPEATED ON THE LIPS OF THE SLENDER HIPPED GIRL WITH THE EYES OF MIDNIGHT AND SO MIGHT I WEAVE FOR YOU A STORY OF WHAT I SEE IN THE BALLADE
A PASSIONATE LYRISM WITH A NOTE OF SELF ABSORPTION SUPPRESSED FEELING TRULY SLAVIC THIS SHYNESS AND A CONCENTRATION THAT IS REMARKABLE EVEN FOR CHOPIN THE NARRATIVE TONE IS MISSING AFTER THE FIRST PAGE
THE AUTOGRAPH IS CHOPIN'S MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT
SINCE DECEASED AND IN IT WITHOUT ANY QUESTION STANDS THE MUCH DISCUSSED E FLAT THIS TESTIMONY IS FINAL THE D NATURAL ROBS THE BAR OF ALL MEANING IT IS INSIPID COLORLESS KULLAK GIVES SIXTY TO THE HALF NOTE AT THE MODERATO
CHOPIN'S ROBUST TREATMENT OF THE FIRST THEME RESULTS IN A STRONG PIECE OF CRAFTMANSHIP THE EPISODICAL NATURE OF THIS BALLADE IS THE FRUIT OF THE ESOTERIC MOODS OF ITS COMPOSER IT FOLLOWS A HIDDEN STORY AND HAS THE QUALITY
KLINDWORTH ATTACKS THE TRILL ON THE SECOND PAGE WITH THE UPPER TONE A FLAT KULLAK AND MERTKE IN THE STEINGRABER EDITION PLAY THE PASSAGE IN THIS MANNER
GIVING SOME THEMATIC WORK OF THE SLIGHTEST TEXTURE TO THE STRINGS AND IN THE PRETTY CODA TO THE WOOD WIND A DELICATELY MANAGED ALLUSION IS MADE BY THE HORNS TO THE SECOND THEME OF THE NOCTURNE IN G
THE FIRST THREE LINES ARE HUGELY HEROIC BUT THE INDIGNATION SOON MELTS AWAY LEAVING AN APATHETIC HUMOR AFTER THE THEME RETURNS AND IS REPEATED WE GET A GENUINE LOVE MOTIF TENDER ENOUGH IN ALL FAITH WHEREWITH TO WOO A PRINCESS
THAT REVERBERATE WITH FORMIDABLE CLANGOR BY ALL MEANS READ LISZT'S GORGEOUS DESCRIPTION OF THE POLONAISE ORIGINATING DURING THE LAST HALF OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY IT WAS AT FIRST A MEASURED PROCESSION OF NOBLES AND THEIR WOMANKIND TO THE SOUND OF MUSIC
MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT IT IS A SINISTER PAGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF THE INJUNCTION TO OPEN WITH PIANISSIMO ONE WISHES THAT THE SHRILL HIGH G FLAT
NOW AUGMENTED AND TREATED WITH A BROAD BRUSH THE FIRST QUESTIONING THEME IS HEARD AGAIN AND WITH A PERPENDICULAR ROAR THE PRESTO COMES UPON US FOR TWO PAGES THE DYNAMIC ENERGY DISPLAYED BY THE COMPOSER IS ALMOST APPALLING
BUT HE CONTRIVED NEVERTHELESS TO WRITE TWO MOVEMENTS OF A PIANO SONATA THAT ARE EXCELLENT THE FIRST HALF OF THE B FLAT MINOR SONATA THE IDEALIZED DANCE FORMS HE PREFERRED
THE POLONAISE MAZURKA AND VALSE WERE ALREADY THERE FOR HIM TO HANDLE BUT THE BALLADE WAS NOT HERE HE IS NOT IMITATOR BUT CREATOR NOT LOOSELY JOINTED BUT COMPACT STRUCTURES GLOWING WITH GENIUS AND PRESENTING DEFINITE UNITY OF FORM AND EXPRESSION
OF THE FOURTH AND GLORIOUS BALLADE IN F MINOR DEDICATED TO BARONNE C DE ROTHSCHILD I COULD WRITE A VOLUME IT IS CHOPIN IN HIS MOST REFLECTIVE YET LYRIC MOOD LYRISM IS THE KEYNOTE OF THE WORK
IT SWUNG ITSELF INTO THE HIGHER REGISTER WHERE IT CAME TO A STOP BEFORE A MAJOR JUST AS THE INTRODUCTION STOPPED BEFORE C MAJOR THEN AFTER THE THEME HAS ONCE MORE PRESENTED ITSELF IN A MODIFIED FORM VARIANT
THE EFFECT WAS STRANGELY IRRITATING TO THE NERVES AND REMINDED ME OF A TORNADO SEEN FROM THE WRONG END OF AN OPERA GLASS
AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT IN AN INSTRUMENTAL VIRTUOSO IS THAT HE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW TO BREATHE AND HOW TO ALLOW HIS HEARERS TO TAKE BREATH
CHOPIN WROTE FIFTEEN POLONAISES THE AUTHENTICITY OF ONE IN G FLAT MAJOR BEING DOUBTED BY NIECKS
DE BEAUVAU THERE ARE FEW EDITORIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE EIGHTEENTH BAR FROM THE BEGINNING
AND FINALLY A SILENCE THAT MARKS THE CESSATION OF AN AGITATING NIGHTMARE NO SABRE DANCE THIS BUT A CONFESSION FROM THE DARK DEPTHS OF A SELF TORTURED SOUL
IT IS AT ONCE THE SYMBOL OF WAR AND LOVE A VIVID PAGEANT OF MARTIAL SPLENDOR A WEAVING CADENCED VOLUPTUOUS DANCE THE PURSUIT OF SHY COQUETTISH WOMAN BY THE FIERCE WARRIOR THE POLONAISE
PUBLISHED A SPECIAL NUMBER IN OCTOBER EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE WITH THE PICTURE OF A FARMER NAMED KRYSIAK BORN IN EIGHTEEN TEN THE YEAR AFTER THE COMPOSER THEREAT FINCK REMARKED
KLINDWORTH IN SIXTEENTHS THE CLOSE IS VERY STRIKING FULL OF THE SPLENDORS OF GLANCING SCALES AND SHRILL OCTAVE PROGRESSIONS IT WOULD INSPIRE A POET TO WRITE WORDS TO IT SAID ROBERT SCHUMANN
PARTLY THROUGH AN UNDEFINABLE PECULIAR INBORN DISPOSITION OF THE ENTIRE RACE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLONAISE EVERYTHING CO OPERATED WHICH SPECIFICALLY DISTINGUISHED THE NATION FROM OTHERS IN THE POLES OF DEPARTED TIMES MANLY RESOLUTION WAS UNITED
DESPITE ITS ESSENTIALLY MASCULINE MOULD IT IS GIVEN A FEMININE TITLE FORMERLY
THEN FOLLOWED A PASSAGE A TEMPO IN WHICH THE PRINCIPAL THEME PLAYED HIDE AND SEEK HOW CLEAR IT ALL BECAME AS TAUSIG PLAYED IT OF TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES HE KNEW LITERALLY NOTHING THE INTRICATE AND EVASIVE PARTS WERE AS EASY AS THE EASIEST
IT IS CHOPIN AT THE SUPREME SUMMIT OF HIS ART AN ART ALEMBICATED PERSONAL AND INTOXICATING I KNOW OF NOTHING IN MUSIC LIKE THE F MINOR BALLADE
THE PREVAILING MOODS ARE COQUETRY AND SWEET CONTENTMENT CONTRAPUNTAL SKILL IS SHOWN IN THE WORKING OUT SECTION CHOPIN ALWAYS WEARS HIS LEARNING LIGHTLY IT DOES NOT OPPRESS US
I MIGHT SAY EASIER I ADMIRED THE SHORT TRILLS IN THE LEFT HAND WHICH WERE TRILLED OUT QUITE INDEPENDENTLY AS IF BY A SECOND PLAYER
AND THERE IS A RUMOR THAT CHOPIN CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR IT XAVER SCHARWENKA MADE A NEW INSTRUMENTATION THAT IS DISCREET AND EXTREMELY WELL SOUNDING WITH EXCELLENT TACT
BEETHOVEN SCHUBERT WEBER AND EVEN BACH IN HIS B MINOR SUITE FOR STRINGS AND FLUTE ALSO INDULGED IN THIS FORM WAGNER AS A STUDENT WROTE A POLONAISE FOR FOUR HANDS IN D AND IN SCHUMANN'S PAPILLONS
NIECKS BECOMES ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THE INSINUATION AND PERSUASION OF THIS COMPOSITION THE COMPOSER SHOWING HIMSELF IN A FUNDAMENTALLY CARESSING MOOD
IT IS DEDICATED TO A LEO THIS IS THE ONE KARASOWSKI CALLS THE STORY OF CHOPIN'S VISION OF THE ANTIQUE DEAD IN AN ISOLATED TOWER OF MADAME SAND'S CHATEAU AT NOHANT
IN ORDER TO CAST ANCHOR IN THE HAVEN OF THE DOMINANT FINISHING WITH A WITCHES DANCE OF TRIPLETS DOUBLED IN THIRDS
A SPIRITUAL SPORTING WITH GRAVER AND MORE PASSIONATE EMOTIONS THOSE BROKEN OCTAVES WHICH USHER IN EACH TIME THE SECOND THEME WITH ITS FASCINATING INFECTIOUS RHYTHMICAL LILT WHAT AN IRONICALLY JOYOUS FILLIP THEY GIVE THE IMAGINATION
IT WAS PRACTICALLY A NOVELTY TO NEW YORK WHEN RAFAEL JOSEFFY PLAYED IT HERE SUPERLATIVELY WELL IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE ORCHESTRAL PART SEEMS WHOLLY SUPERFLUOUS FOR THE SCORING IS NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE
IN THE COURT OF HENRY OF ANJOU IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AFTER HIS ELECTION TO THE POLISH THRONE THE POLONAISE WAS BORN AND THROVE IN THE HARDY WARLIKE ATMOSPHERE IT BECAME A DANCE POLITICAL AND HAD WORDS SET TO IT
BAD TEMPER BECAME HIM ILL BESIDES HIS WHOLE EDUCATION AND TASTES WERE OPPOSED TO SCENES OF VIOLENCE SO THIS ENERGY SPLEEN AND RAGING AT FORTUNE FOUND ESCAPE IN SOME OF HIS MUSIC
LE MILITAIRE TO RUBINSTEIN THIS SEEMED A PICTURE OF POLAND'S GREATNESS AS ITS COMPANION IN C MINOR IS OF POLAND'S DOWNFALL ALTHOUGH KARASOWSKI AND KLECZYNSKI
WITH GLOWING DEVOTION TO THE OBJECT OF THEIR LOVE THEIR KNIGHTLY HEROISM WAS SANCTIONED BY HIGH SOARING DIGNITY AND EVEN THE LAWS OF GALLANTRY AND THE NATIONAL COSTUME EXERTED AN INFLUENCE OVER THE TURNS OF THIS DANCE
MUSICAL SCORE EXCERPT AND WHAT COULD BE MORE EVOCATIVE OF DRAMATIC SUSPENSE THAN THE SIXTEEN BARS BEFORE THE MAD TERRIFYING CODA HOW THE SOLEMN SPLENDORS OF THE HALF NOTES WEAVE AN ATMOSPHERE OF MYSTIC TRAGEDY
AT THE EIGHTH BAR AFTER THIS RETURN KULLAK ADHERES TO THE E INSTEAD OF F AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BAR TREBLE CLEF KLINDWORTH INDICATES BOTH NOR DOES KULLAK FOLLOW MIKULI IN USING A D IN THE CODA HE PREFERS A D SHARP INSTEAD OF A NATURAL
AND IN AN ADEQUATE MANNER THE CONQUEST OF THE STUPENDOUS DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLICATED FIGURES WINDING HARMONIES AND FORMIDABLE PASSAGES TAUSIG FULFILLED THESE REQUIREMENTS PRESENTING AN EMBODIMENT OF THE SIGNIFICATION AND THE FEELING OF THE WORK
THIS TENDENCY TO RETURN UPON HIMSELF A TORMENTING INTROSPECTION CERTAINLY SIGNIFIES A GRAVE STATE BUT CONSIDER THE MUSICAL WEIGHT OF THE WORK THE RECKLESSLY BOLD OUTPOURINGS OF A MIND ALMOST DISTRAUGHT
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY HAVE NO SOUL WAS HER ANSWER THIS MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT THE JAPANESE IS WITHOUT SOUL BUT IT SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE THE ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR SOULS AND THIS WOMAN'S SOUL
WHOLE ANCESTRY BEARING HEAVILY UPON HIM AND AGAIN IN THE MATTER OF HIS IDEAS WHICH HAVE BEEN THRUST UPON HIM AND WHICH HE HAS BEEN BUSILY GARNERING FROM THE GREAT WORLD EVER SINCE THE DAY WHEN HIS EYES FIRST FOCUSSED AND HE DREW STARTLED
RECEIVING BY HEREDITY THE FIERCE BULL LIKE NATURE OF HIS FATHER PLUS THE PASSIVE INDOMITABLENESS AND GROPING SPIRIT OF HIS MOTHER FOMA PROUD AND REBELLIOUS IS REPELLED BY THE SELFISH MONEY SEEKING ENVIRONMENT INTO WHICH HE IS BORN
WAR IS TO DAY THE FINAL ARBITER IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN AND IT IS AS YET THE FINAL TEST OF THE WORTH WHILENESS OF PEOPLES TESTED THUS THE KOREAN FAILS
AND THE ASSERTION WILL MAKE THEM ANGRY FOR A MOMENT THEY POSSESS SEVERAL MAGIC PHRASES WHICH ARE LIKE THE INCANTATIONS OF A VOODOO DOCTOR DRIVING DEVILS AWAY THE PHRASES THAT THE GOOD KIND PEOPLE REPEAT TO THEMSELVES
AND THEY SPOKE THE SAME TONGUE BARRING A CERTAIN BARBAROUS ACCENT WHICH I LEARNED WAS FAR OLDER THAN THE ONE IMBIBED BY ME WITH MY MOTHER'S MILK A FUR CAP SOILED AND SINGED BY MANY CAMP FIRES HALF SHELTERED THE SHAGGY TENDRILS OF MY UNCUT HAIR
A BARBER SHAMPOOED MY HAIR A SERVANT RETURNED WITH CORN BEEF IN TINS A BOTTLE OF PORT ANOTHER OF COGNAC AND BEER
THE RESULT OF THIS ADMIXTURE OF THE REAL AND THE UNREAL IS CONFUSION THRICE CONFOUNDED THE MAN THAT WALKS THE REAL WORLD IN HIS SLEEP BECOMES SUCH A TANGLED MASS OF CONTRADICTIONS PARADOXES AND LIES
THE GOVERNING CLASS ENTRENCHED BY THE PRECEDENT AND POWER OF CENTURIES AND BY THE STAMP IT HAS PUT UPON HIS MIND WILL NEVER FREE HIM IT WOULD BE THE SUICIDE OF THE GOVERNING CLASS AND THE GOVERNING CLASS KNOWS IT
I KNEW IT I FELT IT LIKE SHE AFTER HER FIRE BATH IN THE WOMB OF THE WORLD I DWINDLED IN MY OWN SIGHT MY FEET WERE UNCERTAIN AND HEAVY AND MY SOUL BECAME AS A MEAL SACK LIMP WITH EMPTINESS AND TIED IN THE MIDDLE
ALL OF US MUST CONSIDER WHY WE ARE LIVING BY GOD WE MUST THERE IS NO SENSE IN OUR LIFE THERE IS NO SENSE AT ALL SOME ARE RICH THEY HAVE MONEY ENOUGH FOR A THOUSAND MEN ALL TO THEMSELVES AND THEY LIVE WITHOUT OCCUPATION OTHERS BOW THEIR BACKS IN TOIL ALL THEIR LIFE
NOR HAS HIS MIND CHANGED THERE IS NO FACULTY OF THE MIND OF MAN TO DAY THAT DID NOT EXIST IN THE MINDS OF THE MEN OF LONG AGO MAN HAS TO DAY NO CONCEPT THAT IS TOO WIDE AND DEEP AND ABSTRACT FOR THE MIND OF PLATO OR ARISTOTLE TO GRASP
RARE AND RED RUNNING BLOOD UNDER EVERY SAWING THRUST OF THE IMPLEMENT CALLED A KNIFE HE HAS A PIECE OF CLOTH WHICH HE CALLS A NAPKIN WITH WHICH HE WIPES FROM HIS LIPS AND FROM THE HAIR ON HIS LIPS THE GREASY JUICES OF THE MEAT
AND THE GROANS AND SIGHS OF THE OLD THE RECEIVER IS AS BAD AS THE THIEF AY AND THE THIEF IS FINER THAN THE RECEIVER HE AT LEAST HAS THE COURAGE TO RUN THE RISK BUT THE GOOD KIND PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING WON'T BELIEVE THIS
BUT IF A MAN IS WEAK NOT INCLINED TO WORK SPIT UPON HIM AND GO YOUR WAY AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHEN A MAN COMPLAINS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND CRIES OUT AND GROANS HE IS NOT WORTH MORE THAN TWO KOPEKS HE IS NOT WORTHY OF PITY AND WILL BE OF NO USE TO YOU IF YOU DO HELP HIM
NO HIGHER PROMPTING THAN CONQUEST FOR CONQUEST'S SAKE AND MERE RACE GLORIFICATION TO GO FAR AND TO ENDURE IT MUST HAVE BEHIND IT AN ETHICAL IMPULSE A SINCERELY CONCEIVED RIGHTEOUSNESS
THE COMMODITIES THEY PUT UPON THE MARKET AND WHICH ANNUALLY KILL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN
OUR SOUL STUFF IS NOT A COIN TO BE POCKETED BY THE FIRST CHANCE COMER THE JAPANESE CANNOT POCKET IT ANY MORE THAN HE CAN THRILL TO SHORT SAXON WORDS OR WE CAN THRILL TO CHINESE HIEROGLYPHICS THE LEOPARD CANNOT CHANGE ITS SPOTS NOR CAN THE JAPANESE
LINBOFF WHOSE BOOKS CONTRADICT ONE ANOTHER CANNOT HELP HIM NOR CAN THE PILGRIMS ON CROWDED STEAMERS NOR THE VERSE
THE NITROGENIC WHY OF THE FERTILIZER THE ALCHEMY OF THE SUN THE MICROSCOPIC CELL STRUCTURE OF THE PLANT THE CRYPTIC CHEMISTRY OF ROOT AND RUNNER BUT THEREAT HE STRAIGHTENED HIS WORK WEARIED BACK AND RESTED HIS EYES WANDERED OVER WHAT HE HAD PRODUCED IN THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW
THE INFUSION OF OTHER BLOOD MALAY PERHAPS HAS MADE THE JAPANESE A RACE OF MASTERY AND POWER A FIGHTING RACE THROUGH ALL ITS HISTORY A RACE WHICH HAS ALWAYS DESPISED COMMERCE AND EXALTED FIGHTING TO DAY
THAT HE IS GOD'S OWN MANAGER OVER SO MANY SQUARE MILES OF EARTH CRUST FOR HELPING THE MERCHANT AND BANKING CLASSES TO BELIEVE THAT SOCIETY RESTS ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND THAT CIVILIZATION WOULD GO TO SMASH IF THEY GOT OUT FROM UNDER
BUT IT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ABOVE POSTULATE IS ITSELF A PRODUCT OF WESTERN RACE EGOTISM URGED BY OUR BELIEF IN OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FOSTERED BY A FAITH IN OURSELVES WHICH MAY BE AS ERRONEOUS AS ARE MOST FOND RACE FANCIES
WHY IS THAT AND WHAT JUSTIFICATION HAVE I AND HOW WILL ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GIVE THEIR ORDERS JUSTIFY THEMSELVES WHAT HAVE THEY LIVED FOR BUT MY IDEA IS THAT EVERYBODY OUGHT WITHOUT FAIL TO KNOW SOLIDLY WHAT HE IS LIVING FOR
BUT GIVEN POOR EMPTY KOREA FOR A BREEDING COLONY AND MANCHURIA FOR A GRANARY AND AT ONCE THE JAPANESE BEGINS TO INCREASE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS EVEN SO HE WOULD NOT OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE A BROWN PERIL
AND WE HAVE HARKED BACK TO THE BIDDING OF CONSCIENCE THE COLOSSAL FACT OF OUR HISTORY IS THAT WE HAVE MADE THE RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST OUR RELIGION NO MATTER HOW DARK IN ERROR AND DEED OURS HAS BEEN A HISTORY OF SPIRITUAL STRUGGLE AND ENDEAVOUR
THE PERSON I SOUGHT PRACTISED A PROFESSION AS ANCIENT AS THE ORACLES BUT FAR MORE LUCRATIVE IT IS MENTIONED IN EXODUS SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN CREATED SOON AFTER THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD AND DESPITE THE THUNDER OF ECCLESIASTICS AND THE
WORK IS WHAT HE DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS AND HE WILL WORK AT ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY DURING THE TAKING OF THE TAKU FORTS HE CARRIED SCALING LADDERS AT THE HEADS OF THE STORMING COLUMNS AND PLANTED THEM AGAINST THE WALLS
THEY ARE AGAIN ENSHRINED AS BRIGHT AND POLISHED AS OF YORE AND MY DESTINY IS ONCE MORE IN THEIR KEEPING IT IS GIVEN THAT TRAVAIL AND VICISSITUDE MARK TIME TO MAN'S FOOTSTEPS AS HE STUMBLES ONWARD TOWARD THE GRAVE AND IT IS WELL WITHOUT THE BITTER ONE MAY NOT KNOW THE SWEET
WERE TO DO MY FEELINGS AN INJUSTICE PERHAPS THE BLAME MAY BE SHOULDERED UPON SHYLOCK FAGIN AND THEIR ILK BUT I HAD CONCEIVED AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL
WILL DIE ALL IN GOOD TIME IN THE COURSE OF NATURAL EVOLUTION BUT THEY WILL NOT DIE SO LONG AS THE COWARDLY SOMNAMBULISTIC APES AND TIGERS CLUB AND SCRATCH AND SLASH THIS IS NOT A BRIEF FOR THE PRIZE FIGHTER
THE IDEAS OF THE WEST WERE THE LEAVEN WHICH QUICKENED THE JAPANESE AND THE IDEAS OF THE WEST TRANSMITTED BY THE JAPANESE MIND INTO IDEAS JAPANESE MAY WELL MAKE THE LEAVEN POWERFUL ENOUGH TO QUICKEN THE CHINESE
SO I AVOIDED THEIR LOOKS SHRINKING CLOSE TO THE KERBSTONE AND BY FURTIVE GLANCES DIRECTING MY PROGRESS AT LAST I CAME HARD BY THE PLACE AND PEERING STEALTHILY TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT THAT NONE WHO KNEW MIGHT BEHOLD ME I ENTERED HURRIEDLY
IT IS TO BE DOUBTED STRONGLY IF THE AVERAGE BOURGEOIS SMUG AND FAT AND PROSPEROUS CAN UNDERSTAND THIS MAN FOMA GORDYEEFF THE REBELLION IN HIS BLOOD IS SOMETHING TO WHICH THEIR OWN DOES NOT THRILL
WHY SHOULD MEN FETCH AND CARRY FOR HIM BE SLAVES TO HIM AND HIS MONEY WORK IS NOT EVERYTHING TO A MAN HE SAYS IT IS NOT TRUE THAT JUSTIFICATION LIES IN WORK SOME PEOPLE NEVER DO ANY WORK AT ALL ALL THEIR LIVES LONG YET THEY LIVE BETTER THAN THE TOILERS
NOR IS THE CHINESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE WHICH HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN DESIGNATED HE IS NOT SO ILL DISPOSED TOWARD NEW IDEAS AND NEW METHODS AS HIS HISTORY WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE TRUE
HE FIXED ME WITH A COLD AND GLITTERING EYE SEARCHING WITH THE CHILL OF SPACE TILL MY FINANCIAL STATUS STOOD BEFORE HIM SHIVERING AND ASHAMED I COMMUNED WITH MYSELF BY HIS BROW HE IS A THINKER
STRIPPING THE MANGLED BODIES COLLECTING THE SHRAPNEL AND FERRETING IN THE SHELL HOLES FOR SLIVERS AND FRAGMENTS OF IRON THE CHINESE IS NO COWARD
NOT THAT I WAS IMPERVIOUS TO THE CRITICAL GLANCES OF MY FELLOWS BUT BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN HOGSKIN BELT PLETHORIC AND SWEAT BEWRINKLED WHICH BUCKLED NEXT THE SKIN ABOVE THE HIPS OH IT'S ABSURD I GRANT BUT HAD THAT BELT NOT BEEN SO CIRCUMSTANCED AND SO SITUATED
AND A DIGNITY ENTERED INTO ME AND MY NECK WAS STIFFENED MY HEAD POISED I GATHERED TOGETHER CERTAIN CERTIFICATES OF GOODS AND CHATTELS POINTED MY HEEL TOWARDS HIM AND HIS CABBAGES AND JOURNEYED TOWNWARD I WAS YET A MAN
YOU DO WELL TO PITY PEOPLE IGNAT TELLS FOMA THE BOY ONLY YOU MUST USE JUDGMENT WITH YOUR PITY FIRST CONSIDER THE MAN
THE MIGHTIEST AND ABSURDEST SLEEP WALKER ON THE PLANET CHAINED IN THE CIRCLE OF HIS OWN IMAGININGS MAN IS ONLY TOO KEEN TO FORGET HIS ORIGIN AND TO SHAME THAT FLESH OF HIS
CLEANING THE CONFUSION PREPARATORY TO REBUILDING THEY WERE CLAD IN BLUE PIGTAILS HUNG DOWN THEIR BACKS I WAS IN CHINA I RODE TO THE SHORE INTO THE VILLAGE OF KUELIAN CHING
BUT HE STILL TOILED SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOUNG MEN AND THEY ALL PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO FOMA'S IMAGINATION AS A HUGE HEAP OF WORMS WHO WERE SWARMING OVER THE EARTH MERELY TO EAT HE BECOMES THE LIVING INTERROGATION OF LIFE
SIR GEORGE WAS NEAR FIFTY FULL FIFTEEN YEARS OLDER THAN HIS WIFE WHO WAS AGAIN OLDER THAN HER BROTHER HE WAS A MAN OF MODERATE WEALTH VERY MUCH RESPECTED AND SUPPOSED TO BE POSSESSED OF ALMOST INFINITE WISDOM
LORD RUFFORD HAD BEEN RIDING A VERY BIG CHESTNUT HORSE AND HAD WATCHED THE ANXIOUS STRUGGLES OF KATE MASTERS TO HOLD HER PLACE KATE THOUGH FIFTEEN AND QUITE UP TO THAT AGE IN INTELLIGENCE AND IMPUDENCE WAS SMALL AND LOOKED ALMOST A CHILD
HE INVITED HAMPTON TO SHOOT WITH HIM SURBITON AND BATTERSBY WERE COMING AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW NOT WISHING TO HAVE LESS THAN SIX GUNS HE ASKED HAMPTON HOW HE COULD MAKE UP HIS PARTY MORTON DOESN'T SHOOT HE SAID AND IS AS STIFF AS A POST
THAT HER AUNT WANTED HER FOLLOWED THE MAID UP STAIRS MY DEAR SAID HER AUNT WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED I WANT TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ASK MISTER MORTON TO COME HERE WHILE YOU ARE WITH US
BY MANY WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SUBJECT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST AMATEUR JUDGE OF WINE IN ENGLAND
THAT HE SHOULD BE DRIVEN TO SUCH STRAITS AS THIS THE GIRL WAS EVIDENTLY PREPARED TO MAKE A FIGHT OF IT THERE WOULD BE THE DUKE AND THE DUCHESS AND THAT PRIG MISTLETOE AND THAT IDLE ASS LORD AUGUSTUS
IT IS A MATTER IN WHICH A MAN MUST NOT TELL THE TRUTH BUT WHAT IS THE TRUTH SHE WRITES ME WORD TO SAY THAT SHE HAS TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS THAT I AM ENGAGED TO HER
HE INTENDS TO COME HOME SOMETIMES I SUPPOSE AND IF HE DIDN'T YOU WOULD LADY AUGUSTUS WAS NOT GOING TO LET HER DAUGHTER MARRY A MAN WHO COULD NOT GIVE HER A HOME FOR AT ANY RATE A PART OF THE YEAR
THEN IT WAS FELT THAT KATE MASTERS HAD HAD THE BEST OF THAT LITTLE ENCOUNTER YES I GOT ONE THERE SAID LORD RUFFORD WHILE HIS FRIENDS WERE LAUGHING AT HIM AT LENGTH CAPTAIN GLOMAX WAS SEEN IN THE ROAD AND TONY WAS WITH HIM AT ONCE
SHE HAD OFTEN DONE SO WHEN THEY WERE NOT ENGAGED AND SURELY SHE MIGHT DO SO NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO PREVENT HER COMING DOWN TO THE LIBRARY WHEN SHE HAD GOT RID OF HER TRAVELLING CLOTHES AND IN THIS HOPE HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
CAPTAIN GLOMAX HAD GOT INTO IT AND CAME UP AFTERWARDS WET THROUGH WITH TEMPER BY NO MEANS IMPROVED BUT THE GLORY OF THE DAY HAD BEEN THE WAY IN WHICH LORD RUFFORD'S YOUNG BAY MARE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN A BROOK BEFORE
BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN SEEING MARY HE LEARNED HOWEVER THAT THEY WERE ALL AWARE THAT THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN POSTPONED TO MISSUS MASTERS IT SEEMED THAT ALL THIS HAD BEEN A DISPENSATION OF PROVIDENCE
BUT AS I HAVE GOT SO FAR FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LET IT GO ON IF YOU BREAK WITH HIM I'LL TELL HIM EVERYTHING AND THROW MYSELF INTO HIS HANDS LADY AUGUSTUS SIGHED DEEPLY I WILL MAMMA IT WAS YOU SPOTTED THIS MAN
WHEN SHE GETS TANTRUMS INTO HER HEAD OF COURSE SHE'LL WRITE A LETTER BUT THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE MISSUS MASTERS WHO SAYS SO I SAY THERE AIN'T NOBODY NOBODY
HE POSITIVELY RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MARRY ARABELLA TREFOIL HE WAS BEING HUNTED AND RUN DOWN AND WITH THE INSTINCT OF ALL ANIMALS THAT ARE HUNTED HE PREPARED HIMSELF FOR ESCAPE
OH MAMMA THAT AFTER SO MANY YEARS YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW ME DID YOU EVER SEE ME YET MAKING MYSELF HAPPY IN ANY WAY WHAT NONSENSE YOU TALK
AND NOW HE WAS TELLING HER WHAT HE THOUGHT I FANCIED THAT YOU WERE HAPPY HERE WITHOUT GOING TO SEE AN OLD WOMAN WHO AFTER ALL
SHE WAS MUCH QUIETER THAN HAD BEEN HER WONT WHEN AT MISTLETOE BEFORE AND THOUGH THERE WERE PRESENT TWO OR THREE VERY WELL CIRCUMSTANCED YOUNG MEN SHE TOOK BUT LITTLE NOTICE OF THEM SHE WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH SIR JEFFREY BUNKER
HE HAS GONE HIS WAY AND I HAVE GONE MINE AND I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE PRAY REMEMBER ME TO HIM LADY AUGUSTUS SAID SHE WOULD AND DID ENTERTAIN SOME LITTLE INCREASED RESPECT FOR THE CLERGYMAN WHO COULD BOAST THAT HE HAD BEEN TIPSY IN COMPANY
IT IS LIKE HAVING ANOTHER LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN BEFORE ME THEN HE SAID WHAT HE CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID I THOUGHT MISS MASTERS THAT YOUR HEAVEN WAS ALL HERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT MISTER MORTON
MARY IS NOT GOING SHE SAID NOT GOING TO CHELTENHAM IT HAS ALL BEEN PUT OFF SHE SHAN'T GO AT ALL IF I CAN HELP IT BUT WHY HAS IT BEEN PUT OFF MISSUS MASTERS
THAT SUCH A FOX AS HE HAD BEFORE HIM WOULDN'T STAY THERE TWO MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST HOUND WAS IN IT AND THAT DILLSBOROUGH WOOD WHICH TO HIS IMAGINATION WAS FULL OF POISON WOULD THEN BE ONLY A MILE AND A HALF BEFORE HIM
MISTLETOE IS AN ENORMOUS HOUSE WITH A FRONTAGE NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE LONG COMBINING AS IT DOES ALL THE OFFICES COACH HOUSES AND STABLES THERE IS NOTHING IN ENGLAND MORE UGLY OR PERHAPS MORE COMFORTABLE
INQUIRING AS TO A CERTAIN HIRING OF ROOMS AND PREPARATION FOR A DINNER OR DINNERS WHICH HAD BEEN SPOKEN OF IN REFERENCE TO A FINAL SHOOTING DECREED TO TAKE PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF DILLSBOROUGH IN THE LAST WEEK OF JANUARY
LARRY DON'T YOU BE A COWARD NOR YET SOFT AS FOR COWARD MISSUS MASTERS I DON'T KNOW I SUPPOSE YOU REALLY DO LOVE THE GIRL I DO I THINK I'VE SHOWN THAT
JOHN MORTON MIGHT DIE AND THEN WHO COULD TELL WHETHER LADY USHANT WOULD EVER RETURN TO CHELTENHAM IN THIS WAY THE SHORT LIVED PEACE SOON CAME TO AN END ESPECIALLY AS MISSUS MASTERS ENDEAVOURED TO UTILIZE FOR GENERAL FAMILY PURPOSES
IT MUST DO MAMMA TWELVE HUNDRED A YEAR IS ALL THAT HE OFFERS AND HIS LAWYER SAYS THAT HE WILL MAKE NO STIPULATION WHATEVER AS TO AN ALLOWANCE REALLY MAMMA YOU MIGHT LEAVE THAT TO ME I LIKE TO HAVE EVERYTHING FIXED MY DEAR AND CERTAIN
A THUNDERBOLT AT HER FEET COULD HARDLY HAVE SURPRISED OR ANNOYED HER MORE IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT SHE WANTED LESS THAN ANOTHER IT WAS THE PRESENCE OF THE PARAGON AT MISTLETOE IT WOULD UTTERLY SUBVERT EVERYTHING AND ROB HER OF EVERY CHANCE
BUT AS HE READ DOLLY'S NOTE THERE CAME BACK SOMETHING OF LIFE INTO HIS EYES HE HAD FORSWORN THE CLUB BUT WOULD CERTAINLY GO WHEN THUS INVITED HE WROTE A SCRAWL TO DOLLY I'LL COME
NOR ANY PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH HIRED HORSES TRAVEL SO SLOWLY I BEG THE DUKE'S PARDON BUT I SUFFER THE LESS BECAUSE I KNOW HIS GRACE NEVER WAITS FOR ANYBODY CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE DUKE HAVING SOME REGARD FOR MY FRIENDS DINNERS
LOOKING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE CAPTAIN THE FOX HAS GONE ON TO THE GORSE SAID THE ELDER BOTSEY WHAT A STUPID OLD PIG HE IS MEANING THAT TONY TUPPETT WAS THE PIG HE WAS SEEN GOING ON SAID LARRY WHO HAD COME ACROSS A MAN MENDING A DRAIN
THEY COULD QUARREL WITH THEIR ELDER SISTER WHILE THE ASSURANCE WAS STILL WITH THEM THAT SHE WOULD BE THERE TO FORGIVE THEM BUT NOW THAT SHE WAS GOING AWAY AND THAT IT HAD COME TO BE BELIEVED BY BOTH OF THEM THAT POOR LAWRENCE HAD NO CHANCE
AND HAVING SENT IT OFF BY THE MESSENGER TRIED TO TRUST THAT THERE MIGHT YET BE GROUND FOR HOPE MISSUS MASTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED DOLLY TO SEND SUCH A MESSAGE WITHOUT GOOD REASON
THE FISH AND SOUP HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED AND THE DUKE WAS WAKENING HIMSELF TO ELOQUENCE ON THE FIRST ENTREE WHEN LORD RUFFORD ENTERED THE ROOM
CAPTAIN GLOMAX HAD GOT INTO THE BROOK AND HAD THEN RIDDEN DOWN TO THE HIGH ROAD
SO HE WALKED BY THE PATH ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND WHEN HE CAME OUT ON THE GRAVEL ROAD NEAR THE FRONT DOOR HE FOUND A GENTLEMAN SMOKING A CIGAR AND LOOKING AROUND HIM
LADY USHANT WROTE TO POSTPONE THE VISIT BECAUSE SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO BRAGTON HER LETTER TO MARY THOUGH AFFECTIONATE WAS VERY SHORT HER GRAND NEPHEW JOHN THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
SUCH THINGS WERE OFTEN PLANNED BY LORD RUFFORD AND AFTERWARDS FORGOTTEN OR NEGLECTED
HIS OLD FRIEND TOM SURBITON SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF SENDING HIM BACK TO RUFFORD THEY HAD SAT OUT THE REST OF THE MEN WHO FORMED THE PARTY AND WERE ALONE IN THE SMOKING ROOM SO YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY MISS TREFOIL SAID TOM SURBITON
THEN THERE CAME A SUDDEN DISRUPTION TO ALL THESE PLANS AND A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF HER HOPES TO MISSUS MASTERS
WAS THE VERY WAY TO PROMOTE THE DISEASE THIS MISSUS MASTERS SAID IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON NIGHT AND DAY TILL THE POOR HUSBAND LONGED FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S DEPARTURE
BUT NOTHING WAS SAID AS TO ARABELLA'S HUNTING BECAUSE THE QUESTION WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE RAISED AS TO HER RETURN TO MISTLETOE IN THE EVENING IT WAS HOWEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS TO HAVE A PLACE IN THE CARRIAGE ARABELLA HAD GAINED TWO THINGS SHE WOULD HAVE HER ONE DAY'S HUNTING
THAT SHE HAD NOTICED GROWING IN IT FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS TERRIBLE THAT HELPLESS LOOK IN THE FACE OF A MAN SO BIG IN BODY SO STRONG OF MIND SO IRON LIKE IN WILL
WHEN SHE REACHED THE GATE SHE HEARD THE CLOCK BEGINNING TO STRIKE AND WITH ONE HAND ON HER BREAST SHE BREATHLESSLY LISTENED COUNTING EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN
WITH A THUMPING HEART SHE PUSHED SLOWLY FORWARD THROUGH THE BRUSH UNTIL HER FACE FOX LIKE WITH CUNNING AND SCREENED BY A BLUEBERRY BUSH HUNG JUST OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND THERE SHE LAY
AND FINALLY MUMBLED FER FUN BUT IT WAS PLAIN FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT RUFE HAD PUT TO HALE ONLY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOOTING AND FROM THE HESITATION OF THE WITNESS
THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE JUNE DID WHAT HER FATHER COULD NEVER GET HER TO DO SHE CALLED HER MAMMY AND THEN SHE GAVE THAT OLD WOMAN THE SURPRISE OF HER LIFE SHE KISSED HER RIGHT AWAY SHE MUST SEE EVERYTHING AND BUB IN ECSTASY
THE ORDER WAS NOT OBEYED AND HALE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND HIGH ABOVE JACK'S HEAD AND DROPPED THE BUTT OF HIS WEAPON ON JACK'S SKULL HARD JACK'S HEAD DROPPED BACK BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS HIS EYES CLOSED AND HIS PISTOL CLICKED ON THE FLOOR
AND YET EVERYBODY HAD DASHED TOWARD HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD STOLEN SOMETHING EVEN HALE YES EVEN THAT BOY WITH THE CAP WHO HAD STOOD UP FOR HER AT SCHOOL THAT AFTERNOON HE HAD RUSHED UP HIS FACE AFLAME WITH EXCITEMENT
ONCE HE WENT OUTSIDE AND CREPT ALONG THE WALL OF THE CABIN TO THE EAST AND THE WEST BUT THERE WAS NO BREAK OF LIGHT IN THE MURKY SKY AND HE WENT BACK TO PIPE AND FIRE
THE OLD BEAST STUMBLING OVER THE STONES WHEREAT THE GIRL UNAFRAID MADE SOUNDS OF MUCH MERRIMENT ACROSS HALE STOPPED AND SAID COURTEOUSLY IF YOU ARE GOING UP THIS WAY YOU ARE QUITE WELCOME TO RIDE ON
I RECKON YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I BE I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE AGAIN THE MOUNTAINEER STARED NO USE GITTIN MAD YOUNG FELLER HE SAID COOLLY I MISTAKEN YE FER SOMEBODY ELSE AN I AXE YER PARDON
SHE FELT THE VINDICTIVE HATRED THAT HAD PROLONGED THE FEUD HAD SHE BEEN A MAN SHE COULD NOT HAVE RESTED UNTIL SHE HAD SLAIN THE MAN WHO HAD AMBUSHED HER FATHER SHE EXPECTED BUB TO DO THAT NOW
I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOIN TO HIT HIM SHE DRAWLED UNCONCERNEDLY WELL I'LL LET YOU KNOW SAID HALE LAUGHING NOW AND AS HE WHACKED THE BEAST AGAIN THE GIRL LAUGHED AND THEY WERE BETTER ACQUAINTED PRESENTLY THEY PASSED TWO BOYS HALE WAS WEARING RIDING BOOTS AND TIGHT BREECHES
THEN HE POINTED TO THE SMALLER ONE AND SPOKE TO HALE WITHOUT LOOKING AROUND WHY THAT LITTLE SKATE THERE WAS TEASING THIS LITTLE GIRL AND SHE SLAPPED HIM SAID HALE GRIMLY THE LAD WITH THE CAP TURNED
AND IT WAS A QUICK AND CUNNING RUSE HE OWED HER SOMETHING FOR THAT WHY DID SHE TRY TO PROTECT HIM WONDERFUL EYES TOO THE LITTLE THING HAD DEEP AND DARK AND HOW THE FLAME DID DART FROM THEM WHEN SHE GOT ANGRY HE SMILED REMEMBERING
THAT FAR AWAY LOOKED LIKE A BIT OF GREEN SPRAY SPOUTING ON ITS VERY CREST OLD MAN HE MUTTERED YOU KNOW YOU KNOW AND AS TO A BROTHER HE CLIMBED TOWARD IT
AND THERE WITH A GRIN ON HIS CURIOUS MISMATCHED FACE HE REPEATED YOUNG DAVE'S WORDS YOU'VE COME BACK AGIN
BUT I NEVER HEERD OF SECH A RING AROUND THE ROSY AS EIGHT FELLERS WITH BEAD ON ONE ANOTHER AND NOT A SHOOT SHOT I'M GLAD I WASN'T THAR HE FROWNED WHEN HALE SPOKE OF THE RED FOX
I'M NOT GOING TO BE HERE LONG SAID HALE WHERE YOU GOIN I DON'T KNOW BUDD PUFFED HIS PIPE WELL
SHE'S GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU SAID MISSUS CRANE SMILING MYSTERIOUSLY SHE'S BEEN FIXING FOR YOU FOR AN HOUR MY BUT SHE'S PRETTY IN THEM NEW CLOTHES WHY JUNE JUNE WAS COMING IN
SHE SAID CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND SOMEHOW THE MERE FACT THAT HALE HAD BEEN EVEN FOR THE MOMENT ANTAGONISTIC TO THE OTHER FACTION SEEMED TO PUT HIM IN THE GIRL'S MIND AT ONCE ON HER SIDE AND STRAIGHTWAY SHE TALKED FREELY OF THE FEUD
BUT HE SAID CHEERILY ALL RIGHT YOU GO BACK AND KEEP IN THE HOUSE AND I'LL BE OVER BY AND BY AND WE'LL TALK IT OVER AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD SHE WENT SHE HAD MEANT TO PUT ON HER NEW DRESS AND HER NEW SHOES AND STOCKINGS THAT NIGHT
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN LIKE THAT BEFORE HIS FACE WAS SMOOTH AND LOOKED DIFFERENT AS DID HIS THROAT AND HIS HANDS HIS BREECHES WERE TIGHT
JUNE'LL BE HERE IN A MINUTE AN YOU CAN RIDE BACK WITH HER I RECKON YOU AIR GOIN THAT A WAY JUNE SHORE MY BUT SHE'LL BE GLAD TO SEE YE
EACH VOLUNTEER POLICEMAN WITH HIS BACK TO THE TARGET AND AT THE WORD OF COMMAND WHEELING AND FIRING SIX SHOTS IN RAPID SUCCESSION AND HE DID NOT WONDER AT THEIR SNORTS OF SCORN AT SUCH BAD SHOOTING
AND SO SHE HAD GONE FROM THE GAP AS SHE HAD COME INTO IT WITH UNMITTENED HANDS AND BARE FEET THE SOFT WIND WAS VERY GOOD TO THOSE DANGLING FEET AND SHE ITCHED TO HAVE THEM ON THE GREEN GRASS OR IN THE COOL WATERS
AN ANXIOUS LOOK HAD COME INTO RUFE'S EYES WOULD SHE LIE FOR HIM NEVER SAID JUNE AH SHE WOULD SHE WAS A TOLLIVER AND RUFE TOOK A BREATH OF DEEP CONTENT
YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF HE SAID TO THE MOUNTAIN BOY I WASN'T ATTER THE GAL HE SAID INDIGNANTLY I WAS COMIN FER HIM THE BOY WITH THE CAP TRIED TO GET AWAY FROM HALE'S GRASP
THE QUIET SMILE OF THAT ASTUTE YOUNG WOMAN HAD TOLD HALE PLAINLY AND SOMEWHAT TO HIS EMBARRASSMENT THAT SHE KNEW SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED BETWEEN THE TWO BUT THAT SMILE SHE NEVER GAVE TO JUNE
IN THE SHADOWS BELOW IT SMOTE THE MISTS INTO TATTERS LEAF AND BUSH GLITTERED
ALL DROPPED AND WITH THOSE TWO ALL PUT UP THEIR GUNS EACH MAN HOWEVER WATCHING NOW THE MAN WHO HAD JUST BEEN COVERING HIM IT IS NOT WISE FOR THE STRANGER TO SHOW TOO MUCH INTEREST IN THE PERSONAL AFFAIRS OF MOUNTAIN MEN
I'M SORRY LITTLE GIRL THE GIRL LIFTED HER GREAT TROUBLED EYES TO HIM BUT NO WORD PASSED HER LIPS AND HALE HELPLESSLY LEFT HER JUNE DID NOT CRY THAT NIGHT SHE SAT BY THE WINDOW WRETCHED AND TEARLESS
AND TWO BODIES OF MEN ONE LED BY HER FATHER THE OTHER BY THE MAN SHE LOVED READY TO FLY AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS THE ONE TO GET THE CONDEMNED MAN ALIVE THE OTHER TO SEE THAT HE DIED SHE GOT UP WITH A GROAN SHE WALKED INTO THE GARDEN
SHE HAD NO DENIAL AND THE OLD FELLOW SMILED KINDLY COME ON NOW LITTLE JUNE WALKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MILLER FROM HALE BACK TO THE OLD MAN'S CABIN TWO HUNDRED YARDS UP THE ROAD
WELL SAID HALE HE WON'T DO IT WILL HE JUNE SHOOK HER HEAD AND THEN SHE SAID SIGNIFICANTLY DAVE'S DRINKIN HALE'S BROW CLOUDED
AND THE KEY WAS IN THE LOCK HE ROSE TO GO TO IT AND LOOK WITHIN AND THEN DROPPED HEAVILY BACK INTO HIS CHAIR HE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY NOW TO GET TO WORK SEVERAL TIMES HE ROSE RESTLESSLY AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW
AND THAT WAS WHEN THE ROAR OF THE WATER THROUGH THE ROCKY CHASM OF THE GAP MADE HIM THINK OF THE ROAR OF IRON WHEELS THAT RUSHING THROUGH SOME DAY WOULD DROWN IT INTO SILENCE
AND BEHIND HIM RAN A SMALLER ONE BELLOWING HALE HEARD THE BOY WITH THE CAP CALL KINDLY HOLD ON LITTLE GIRL I WON'T LET EM TOUCH YOU JUNE STOPPED WITH HIM AND HALE RAN TO THEM HERE HE CALLED WHAT'S THE MATTER
A PISTOL GLEAMED IN THE HAND OF EACH AND SLOWLY THRUST HIS OWN WEAPON INTO HIS POCKET GET OFF THAT HORSE ADDED THE STERN VOICE JUST THEN HALE RUSHED ACROSS THE STREET AND THE MOUNTAIN YOUTH SAW HIM
JACK MANAGED TO GET HIS PISTOL OUT
AGAIN WITH HER EYES ON RUFE SHE REPEATED
AND HE SMILED AGAIN CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE HER EYES FELL AT THE ANCIENT BANTER BUT SHE LIFTED THEM STRAIGHTWAY AND STARED AGAIN YOU LIVE AROUND HERE SHE STARED ON
LAUGHED GOOD NATUREDLY AND WITH UNDERSTANDING TURNED AWAY MECHANICALLY HE WALKED TO THE CLUB BUT THERE WAS NO CLUB
THE DOOR OPENED A FEW INCHES AND THROUGH IT BUB SHOUTED FOR HER TO COME ON THE BACK DOOR TOO WAS CLOSED AND NOT A RAY OF DAYLIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM EXCEPT AT THE PORT HOLE WHERE BUB WITH A WINCHESTER HAD BEEN STANDING ON GUARD
SHE WAS LOOKING DOWN SHYLY AND SHE DID NOT SEEM MUCH PLEASED THEY ARE KINFOLKS O MINE TOO SHE SAID
LIKE WIND DRIVEN CLOUDS OF MIST THICKENING INTO WATER AS THEY CAME THE SHINGLES RATTLED AS THOUGH WITH THE HEAVY SLAPPING OF HANDS THE PINES CREAKED AND THE SUDDEN DUSK OUTSIDE MADE THE CABIN WHEN HE PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN AS DARK AS NIGHT
FROM WHICH HANGS A POUCH OF THE SAME MATERIAL
A MINUTE LATER NESSUS SAW A DARK FIGURE COME STEALTHILY ALONG HE STOPPED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE ROADS AND STOOD FOR A FEW SECONDS IN HESITATION
AND HEARD HOW COMPLETELY THE HOSTILE FACTION WERE THE MASTERS OF CARTHAGE HE AGREED THAT THE COUNSELS OF THE OLD NOBLEMAN WERE WISE AND THAT MALCHUS COULD HAVE DONE NO GOOD WHEREAS HE WOULD HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH
THE SCENE WAS A BUSY ONE THE DOCKS OF CARTHAGE WERE EXTENSIVE
WHERE NOTHING WAS LEFT UNDONE WHICH COULD ADD TO THE COMFORT AND CONTENTMENT OF THE TROOPS THERE IS NO STRONGER EVIDENCE OF THE POPULARITY OF HANNIBAL AND OF THE INFLUENCE WHICH HE EXERCISED OVER HIS TROOPS THAN THE FACT THAT THE ARMY UNDER HIM
TO SEE THE LAST OF THEIR SONS AND RELATIVES OF THE GUARD HAVING SEEN THEIR HORSES SAFELY STOWED BELOW THE YOUNG MEN CROWDED TO THE SIDE OF THE SHIP TO EXCHANGE ADIEUS WITH THEIR FRIENDS THE PARTING WAS A BRIEF ONE FOR THE WIND WAS FAIR
FORMED BY THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS THESE RESISTED WITH GREAT OBSTINACY THE PRINCIPES WHO FORMED THE SECOND LINE OF THE ROMAN INFANTRY CAME FORWARD AND JOINED THE SPEARMEN AND EVEN THE TRIARII PRESSED FORWARD AND JOINED IN THE FIGHT
OR TO LAUNCH THEIR TRIREMES TO ENGAGE THE FLEETS OF ROME THE SEVERE CHECKS WHICH THEY HAD LATELY SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE NEWLY FORMED ROMAN NAVY AND THE CERTAINTY THAT ERE LONG A TREMENDOUS STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS MUST TAKE PLACE
AT LAST THE DAY FOR EMBARKATION ARRIVED AND THE TROOPS DEFILED THROUGH THE TEMPLE OF MOLOCH WHERE SACRIFICES WERE OFFERED UP FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE MALCHUS UNDER THE PRETENSE THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT READY AT THE LAST MOMENT LINGERED AT HOME
FIGHTING WITH EXTREME OBSTINACY THE CARTHAGINIAN CENTRE WAS FORCED GRADUALLY BACK UNTIL THEY WERE AGAIN IN A LINE WITH THE AFRICANS ON THEIR FLANKS THE ROMANS HAD INSENSIBLY PRESSED IN FROM BOTH FLANKS UPON THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD MET WITH RESISTANCE
THE WHOLE SPACE BELOW WAS OCCUPIED BY CARGO OR HORSES THE TROOPS LIVED AND SLEPT ON DECK HERE ON WIDE FLAT STONES THEY COOKED THEIR MEALS WHILED AWAY THE DAY BY GAMES OF CHANCE
WE OLD MEN BOW MORE RESIGNEDLY TO THE DECREES OF THE GODS YOU KNOW THE SAYING THOSE WHOM THE GODS WOULD DESTROY THEY FIRST STRIKE WITH MADNESS CARTHAGE IS SUCH
STAND ROCKING THEMSELVES FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE EXTERIOR OF THE TENT IS MADE OF COARSE WHITE CANVAS THIS IS THICKLY LINED BY FOLD AFTER FOLD OF A THIN MATERIAL DYED A DARK BLUE TO KEEP OUT THE HEAT OF THE SUN
HE WAS READY FOR ARMED INSURRECTION AGAINST THE TYRANTS OF CARTHAGE BUT HE REVOLTED FROM THE THOUGHT OF THIS PLAN FOR A MIDNIGHT MASSACRE
IF THE MAN BEHIND US BE HONEST HE WILL GO STRAIGHT ON IF HE BE A SPY HE WILL HESITATE AND STOP AT THE CORNER TO DECIDE WHICH OF US HE SHALL FOLLOW THEN I SHALL KNOW WHAT TO DO
MALCHUS BRINGS UP OUR NUMBER HERE TO THIRTY AND WHEN ALL THE SECTIONS ARE FILLED UP WE SHALL BE READY FOR ACTION FAILURE OUGHT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THE HOUSES OF HANNO AND THIRTY OF HIS PARTY WILL BE ATTACKED AND THE TYRANTS SLAIN
BY STUDY AND BY LEISURE HAVE PREPARED THEIR MINDS FOR SUCH A CHARGE
MANON SAID FOR THE YOUNG BLOOD RUNS HOTLY IN YOUR VEINS AND YOUR RAGE AT SEEING THE FATE WHICH IS TOO CERTAINLY IMPENDING OVER CARTHAGE AND WHICH YOU ARE POWERLESS TO PREVENT IS IN NO WAY TO BE BLAMED
HER ARISTOCRACY WERE SOLDIERS AS WELL AS TRADERS READY AT ONCE TO EMBARK ON THE MOST DISTANT AND ADVENTUROUS VOYAGES TO LEAD THE TROOPS OF CARTHAGE ON TOILSOME EXPEDITIONS AGAINST INSURGENT TRIBES OF NUMIDIA AND LIBYA
THE ROMAN ARMY WAS AS BEFORE WATCHING HIM AT A SHORT DISTANCE OFF MALCHUS AT ONCE SOUGHT THE TENT OF THE GENERAL WHOSE SURPRISE AT SEEING HIM ENTER WAS GREAT FOR HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD RETURN UNTIL THE SPRING
SWEPT ROUND BEHIND THEIR INFANTRY AND FELL UPON THE REAR OF THE ITALIAN HORSE WHILE THE NUMIDIANS CHARGED THEM FIERCELY IN FRONT THUS CAUGHT IN A TRAP THE ITALIAN HORSE WERE COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED AND SO BEFORE THE HEAVY INFANTRY OF THE TWO ARMIES MET EACH OTHER
AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF THAT EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER HE GAVE THE SIGNAL TO HIS TRUMPETER WHO AGAIN BLEW A LONG AND PIERCING BLAST THE WORK OF EMBARKATION AT ONCE COMMENCED
ON THE RIGHT BANK OF THE AUFIDUS THE NEXT MORNING EMILIUS WHO WAS IN COMMAND DETACHED A THIRD OF HIS FORCE ACROSS THE RIVER AND ENCAMPED THEM THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING THE ROMAN FORAGING PARTIES ON THAT SIDE AND OF INTERRUPTING THOSE OF THE CARTHAGINIANS
AT WHICH ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY WOULD BE PRESENT AMONG THOSE NOW IN COUNCIL OPINIONS WERE NEARLY EQUALLY DIVIDED THE ONE PARTY URGED THAT DID THEY TAKE STEPS TO PREPARE THE POPULACE FOR A RISING
AT A LITTLE FREQUENTED LANDING STAGE A BOAT WAS AWAITING THEM AND THEY WERE AT ONCE ROWED TO THE SHIP WHICH WAS LYING AT ANCHOR HALF A MILE FROM THE SHORE IN READINESS FOR AN EARLY START IN THE MORNING ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN TRACED
AND FORMED IT IN ORDER OF BATTLE LEAVING EIGHT THOUSAND OF HIS MEN TO GUARD HIS CAMP BY THUS DOING HE OBTAINED A POSITION WHICH HE COULD THE BETTER HOLD WITH HIS INFERIOR FORCES WHILE THE ROMANS DEEMING THAT HE INTENDED TO ATTACK THEIR CAMP ON THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER
BUT HE WILL CARRY NO MORE TALES TO HANNO TWO DAYS LATER NESSUS ON HIS RETURN FROM HIS VISIT TO MANON BROUGHT NEWS THAT THE LATTER HAD ARRANGED WITH THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP OWNED BY A FRIEND TO CARRY THEM ACROSS TO CORINTH
IN WHICH THE ODDS AGAINST THEM WERE OVERWHELMING AND GREAT EVEN GISCON GENERALLY GRAVE AND GLOOMY WAS AS LIGHT HEARTED AS THE REST THE ARISTOCRACY OF CARTHAGE WERE
EACH GAVE A STATEMENT OF THE NUMBER OF MEN ENROLLED IN HIS SECTION WITH A FEW WORDS AS TO THE DISPOSITION OF EACH ALMOST WITHOUT AN EXCEPTION EACH OF THESE MEN WAS ANIMATED WITH A SENSE OF PRIVATE WRONG SOME HAD LOST NEAR RELATIVES
THE LAD SAID THE SHADOWS ARE LENGTHENING AND THE HEAT IS DECLINING WE HAVE ONLY YOUR WORD FOR THE DECLINE OF THE HEAT MALCHUS ONE OF THE YOUNGER MEN LAUGHED I FEEL HOTTER THAN EVER
AND ON IT ARE SPREAD FOUR COUCHES ON WHICH IN A POSITION HALF SITTING HALF RECLINING REPOSE THE PRINCIPAL PERSONAGES OF THE PARTY
CARRYING THE PROVISIONS IN BUNDLES THEY MADE FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND AFTER THREE DAYS JOURNEY REACHED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR ADVENTURE THE CAMP OF HANNIBAL HE WAS STILL LYING IN HIS INTRENCHED CAMP NEAR GERONIUM
THE GATHERED CROWD ALL EXCITED THEIR ASTONISHMENT AND THEIR WHITE TEETH GLISTENED AS THEY CHATTED INCESSANTLY WITH A VERY BABEL OF LAUGHTER AND NOISE NOT LESS LIGHT HEARTED WERE THE CHOSEN BAND OF YOUNG NOBLES GROUPED BY THE GENERAL'S SHIP
THAT HANNO'S PARTY WOULD BE ON THEIR GUARD IN FUTURE AND THAT THE JUDGES WOULD EFFECT WHOLESALE ARRESTS AND EXECUTIONS WHEREAS WERE THE POPULACE APPEALED TO IN THE MIDST OF THE EXCITEMENT WHICH WOULD BE CAUSED
IT IS ONLY BECAUSE YOU ARE ON HORSEBACK THAT I HAVE COME ROUND TO THIS GATE HAD YOU COME ON FOOT WE SHOULD HAVE ENTERED BY THE FRONT FORTUNATELY THERE ARE AMONG US MANY WHO ARE DEEMED TO BE MERE PLEASURE SEEKERS MEN WHO WAGER FORTUNES ON THEIR HORSES
FOR CARTHAGE WITH ITS HIDEOUS TYRANNY ITS FOUL CORRUPTION ITS FORGETFULNESS OF ITS GLORY ITS HONOUR AND EVEN ITS SAFETY IS UTTERLY HATEFUL TO ME I TRUST THAT NEVER AGAIN SHALL I SET FOOT WITHIN ITS WALLS
MATTERS ARE GETTING RIPE I HAVE EIGHT MEN SWORN INTO MY SECTION AMONG THE WEAVERS
AND AVOIDING THE BUSY STREETS OF THE TOWN DIRECTED ITS COURSE TOWARDS THE MORE QUIET ROADS OF THE OPULENT QUARTER OF MEGARA THE CRIES OF THE PEOPLE AT THE APPROACH OF THE ELEPHANT PRECEDED ITS COURSE AND ALL TOOK REFUGE IN GARDENS OR HOUSES
SARDINIA THE ISLANDS OF THE AEGEAN CRETE AND EGYPT LIBYA AND PHOENICIA ARE ALL REPRESENTED THERE THEY ARE RECRUITED ALIKE FROM THE LOWER ORDERS OF THE GREAT CITY AND FROM THE TRIBES AND PEOPLE WHO OWN HER SWAY
KNOWING THAT SUCCESS WOULD BE HOPELESS AND AS WE SHOULD BE STRONG AT HOME WE SHOULD BE RESPECTED ABROAD AND MIGHT VIEW WITHOUT APPREHENSION THE RISING POWER OF ROME THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR BOTH OF US
AND THE TWO AT ONCE SET OUT FOR HIS HOUSE
BY ENDEAVOURING FURTHER TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CHARGED MANON KNOWS WHAT IS BEST AND NO DOUBT A PREMATURE ATTEMPT TO EXCITE THE POPULACE TO FORCE HANNO INTO SENDING THE REINFORCEMENTS WE SO MUCH NEED WOULD HAVE NOT ONLY FAILED
THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF THE REIGNING BEAUTIES OF CARTHAGE AND OTHER SIMILAR TOPICS AND MALCHUS WHO WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE SECRET CONSPIRACY WHICH HE HAD JUST SWORN TO AID COULD NOT HELP BEING SURPRISED AT THE CARELESS GAIETY OF THE YOUNG MEN
AT DAYLIGHT I AM AGAIN ON THE MOVE AND SUNRISE FINDS ME BUSY MAKING AN OUTLINE SKETCH OF THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CASTLE THAT OCCUPIES I SHOULD IMAGINE ONE OF THE MOST IMPREGNABLE POSITIONS IN ALL ASIA MINOR
AND IT IS DIVIDED INTO COMPARTMENTS SIMILAR TO A PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION THE SHEIKH IS A BIG BURLY FELLOW OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE WEARING A TURBAN THE SIZE OF A HALF BUSHEL MEASURE
AS IT IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND HAS THREE STEAMERS PLYING ON ITS WATERS AT FREDONIA I AM SHOWN THROUGH THE CELEBRATED WATCH MOVEMENT FACTORY HERE
IN THEIR EXCESSIVE IMPATIENCE AND INORDINATE INQUISITIVENESS TO EXAMINE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT ONE OF THEM THINKING THE CYCLOMETER TO BE A WATCH PUTS HIS EAR DOWN TO SEE IF HE CAN HEAR IT TICK
BUT THE CERULEAN WAIST SCARF BESTOWED UPON ME BY OUR HUNGARIAN FRIEND IGALI AT BELGRADE NO LONGER ADDS ITS EMBELLISHMENTS TO MY PERSONAL ADORNMENTS WHENEVER A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS
THEY SEEM MUCH CONFUSED AT FINDING THEMSELVES THE OBJECT OF DIRECT ATTENTION AND THEY APPEAR SEVERAL DEGREES WILDER THAN THE MEN SO FAR AS COMPREHENDING SUCH A PRODUCT OF CIVILIZATION AS A PHOTOGRAPH IS AN INDICATION
IS HALF BURIED IN HOT DUST THE BLACKBERRIES ARE DEAD ON THE BUSHES AND THE LONG SUFFERING CORN LOOKS AS THOUGH AFFLICTED WITH THE YELLOW JAUNDICE
TO A BOX OF BOOKS AND PERMIT ITS TRANSPORTATION THROUGH THE COUNTRY ON CONDITION IF THEY WILL THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE OPENED IN TRANSIT SURELY THERE WOULD BE NO DANGER OF THE PEOPLE'S MINDS BEING ENLIGHTENED
IN FROLICSOME CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALWAYS HAVING A HOWLING MAJORITY OVER THEIR LESS PROLIFIC NEIGHBORS REFRESHMENTS IN ABUNDANCE ARE TENDERED AND THE USUAL PANTOMIMIC EXPLANATIONS EXCHANGED BETWEEN US
THE PERSIAN TERM FOR AN OCCIDENTAL WHILE TALKING WITH THEM I AM SOMEWHAT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AT SEEING A LADY ON HORSEBACK AND TWO CHILDREN IN A KAJAVEH MULE PANIER
FALL ON BIASED EARS AND I PEREMPTORILY ORDER HIM TO DEPART THE TABREEZ TRAIL IS NOW EASILY FOLLOWED WITHOUT A GUIDE AND WITH A SENSE OF PERFECT FREEDOM AND UNRESTRAINT
WHILE THUS PARTAKING FREELY OF THE BREAD AND CHEESE I DO NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THAT THE OTHERS PARTAKE VERY SPARINGLY AND THAT THEY SEEM TO BE RATHER ASTONISHED BECAUSE I AM NOT FOLLOWING THEIR EXAMPLE
ARE USUALLY SURROUNDED BY SUBSTANTIAL MUD WALLS TEN OR TWELVE FEET HIGH
WHERE FROM THE LITTLE HAMLET OF SPRINGFIELD THE ROADS BECOME GOOD THEN BETTER AND FINALLY BEST AT GIRARD THE HOME OF THE VETERAN SHOWMAN DAN RICE THE BEAUTIFYING WORKS OF WHOSE GENEROUS HAND ARE EVERYWHERE VISIBLE IN HIS NATIVE TOWN
PLACING A PAN OF BURNING TEZEK BENEATH A LOW TABLE THE WHOLE FAMILY HUDDLE AROUND IT COVERING THE TABLE AND THEMSELVES SAVE OF COURSE THEIR HEADS UP WITH QUILTS FACING EACH OTHER IN THIS RIDICULOUS MANNER
AND WELL WORN CAMEL PATHS AFFORD SOME EXCELLENT WHEELING NEAR MID DAY WHILE LABORIOUSLY ASCENDING A LONG BUT NOT ALTOGETHER UNRIDABLE ASCENT I MEET A COUPLE OF MOUNTED SOLDIERS
AND PROCEEDS TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE ROLLING ME CIGARETTES ASKING QUESTIONS AND CURIOUSLY INVESTIGATING ANYTHING ABOUT ME THAT STRIKES HIM AS PECULIAR I SHOW THEM AMONG OTHER THINGS A CABINET PHOTOGRAPH OF MYSELF
WHERE THERE IS A WIDE BRICK PAVED WALK THE HOUSE OCCUPIES ONE SIDE OF THE GARDEN THE OTHER THREE SIDES ARE INCLOSED BY A HIGH MUD WALL AFTER RIDING A FEW TIMES ALONG THE BRICK PAVED WALK
I LIKEWISE SMILE BUT AFFECT IGNORANCE AND INNOCENCE CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THE MYSTERIOUS TICKING
BUT UNFORTUNTAELY THIS IS OLD YAORT YAORT THAT IS IN THE SERE AND YELLOW STAGE OF ITS USEFULNESS AS HUMAN FOOD AND ALTHOUGH THESE PEOPLE DOUBTLESS CONSUME IT THUS I PREFER TO WAIT UNTIL SOMETHING MORE ACCEPTABLE AND LESS ODORIFEROUS TURNS UP
AND HE NOW THINKS OF GAINING A NICE NUMEROUS HAREM AND A WALLED IN GARDEN WITH TREES AND FOUNTAINS CUCUMBERS AND CARPOOSES
GROWS INQUISITIVE ABOUT MY REVOLVER FIRST EXTRACTING THE CARTRIDGES TO PREVENT ACCIDENT I HAND IT TO HIM
ALLAH ANYBODY WOULD THINK FROM HIS ACTIONS THAT THE SANCTIMONIOUS OLD MAN IKIN FIVE FEET THREE
WHICH EMBRACES BOTH PERSIAN AND TURKISH TERRITORY AND THE OCCASION IS MOST OPPORTUNE FOR SEEING SOMETHING OF THESE WILD NOMADS IN THEIR OWN MOUNTAIN PASTURES THE GREENSWARD IS RIDABLE AND I
OR TO PREVENT A CONFLICT BETWEEN US WILL ALWAYS REMAIN AN UNCERTAINTY I AM AFRAID HOWEVER THAT WITH THE ADVANTAGE ON THEIR SIDE THE KOORDISH HERDSMEN RARELY TROUBLE THEMSELVES
AND WHEN THE MOON LOOKS ALMOST AS THOUGH FAIR LUNA HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DECORATING HERSELF TO EMBELLISH A SCENE THAT WITHOUT HER LOVELY PRESENCE WOULD BE INCOMPLETE
WATCHING THE FESTIVE MERRY MAKINGS OF THE MEN THEIR HEADS AND NECKS ARE RESPLENDENT WITH BANDS AND NECKLACES OF GOLD COINS IT STILL BEING A CUSTOM OF THE EAST TO LET THE FEMALE MEMBERS OF A FAMILY WEAR THE SURPLUS WEALTH ABOUT THEM IN THE SHAPE OF GOLD ORNAMENTS AND JEWELS
SPLENDID GRAVEL ROADS LEAD FROM CRUM'S POINT TO SOUTH BEND AND ON THROUGH MISHAWAKA ALTERNATING WITH SANDY STRETCHES TO GOSHEN WHICH TOWN IS SAID BY THE GOSHENITES TO BE THE PRETTIEST IN INDIANA
THAN ABOUT THEIR FACES AND
AND THE CHILLINESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE ALREADY APPARENT BODES ILL FOR ANYTHING LIKE A COMFORTABLE NIGHT BUT I SCARCELY ANTICIPATE BEING DISTURBED BY ANYTHING SAVE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS
OWN UNWARLIKE MINDS OF ALL DISQUIETING APPREHENSIONS AND ENJOYING THEIR FAMILY REUNION IN THE CALM ATMOSPHERE OF PERFECT SECURITY SOME LAWLESS PARTY PASSING ALONG THE ROAD MIGHT PERADVENTURE DROP IN AND ABUSE THEIR HOSPITALITY
THE SERVANT WHO PRESENTS MY LETTER OF INTRODUCTION FILLS THE UNTUTORED MIND OF HIS MASTER WITH WONDERMENT CONCERNING WHAT THE PEASANTS HAVE TOLD HIM ABOUT THE BICYCLE THE PASHA KHAN MAKES HIS APPEARANCE WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN THE TROUBLE
WHEN ALL NATURE SEEMS HUSHED IN PEACEFUL SLUMBERS WHEN THE STARS SEEM TO FIRST PEEP CAUTIOUSLY FROM THE IMPENETRABLE DEPTHS OF THEIR HIDING PLACE AND THEN TO COMMENCE BLINKING BENIGNANTLY AND APPROVINGLY UPON THE WORLD
BE IT OBSERVED THAT FEW PEOPLE ARE
A BLOOD THIRSTY YOUNGSTER OF TEN OR TWELVE SUMMERS HE BECOMES WILDLY HILARIOUS GAMBOLING ABOUT THE TENT AND ROLLING OVER AND KICKING UP HIS HEELS HE THEN GOES TO THE SHEIKH
AND BOWLING BRISKLY ALONG THE RIGHT ROAD WITHIN THEIR RANGE OF VISION FOR OVER A MILE
MOREOVER I DON'T CARE TO WAIT AROUND THREE HOURS ON PURPOSE TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THESE PEOPLE'S COOKING EGGS THERE ARE NONE THEY ARE DEVOURED I FANCY ALMOST BEFORE THEY ARE LAID
IS PLAINLY DISCERNIBLE TO EVERYBODY IN THE COMPARTMENT AND THEY BECOME HIGHLY INTERESTED AND AMUSED AND COMMENCE LOOKING AT ME FOR AN EXPLANATION WITH A VIEW TO HUMORING THE SPIRIT OF AMUSEMENT THUS AWAKENED
BUT FUEL IS AS SCARCE AS IN ASIA MINOR AND LIKE THE TURKS AND ARMENIANS IN WINTER THEY HAVE RESOURCE TO A PECULIAR AND ECONOMICAL ARRANGEMENT TO KEEP THEMSELVES WARM
AND A COUPLE OF UNATTACHED TRAVELLERS KEEPING WITH THE PARTY FOR COMPANY AND SOCIETY A MULE DRIVER HAS CHARGE OF PACK MULES CARRYING BOXES CONTAINING AMONG OTHER THINGS HER HUSBAND'S LIBRARY
I WAS GRATIFIED TO LEARN FROM THE PERSIAN CONSUL AT ERZEROUM THAT MY STOCK OF TURKISH WOULD ANSWER ME AS FAR AS TEHERAN
AND I AM SOON INSTALLED IN HOSPITABLE QUARTERS
THE OBTRUSIVE MEDDLESOMENESS OF TWO YOUNGER MEN WHOM I AFTERWARD DISCOVER TO BE SONS OF THE PASHA KHAN WHO SEEM ALMOST INCLINED TO TAKE THE BICYCLE OUT OF MY CHARGE ALTOGETHER
IN THIS OPINION I UNRESERVEDLY CONCUR FROM MUREMBWE POINT HAVING FINISHED OUR COFFEE AND ENDED OUR DISCOURSE ON ETHICS WE PROCEEDED ON OUR VOYAGE
HE APPEARED MORE LIKE A MAN WHO HAD NOT PASSED HIS FIFTIETH YEAR HIS HAIR HAS A BROWNISH COLOUR YET BUT IS HERE AND THERE STREAKED WITH GREY LINES OVER THE TEMPLES
AND OVERLAPPING IT ON THE NORTH SIDE AS FAR AS THE HILLS OF CHAMATI WAS RUWENGA ALSO A COUNTRY GOVERNED BY MUKAMBA BEYOND RUWENGA FROM THE HILLS OF CHAMATI TO THE RUANDA RIVER WAS THE COUNTRY OF CHAMATI
THAT RUGGED FRAME OF HIS ENCLOSED A YOUNG AND MOST EXUBERANT SOUL EVERY DAY I HEARD INNUMERABLE JOKES AND PLEASANT ANECDOTES INTERESTING HUNTING STORIES IN WHICH HIS FRIENDS OSWELL WEBB VARDON AND GORDEN CUMMING
AND WHY I ASKED DID YOU COME SO FAR BACK WITHOUT FINISHING THE TASK WHICH YOU SAY YOU HAVE GOT TO DO SIMPLY BECAUSE I WAS FORCED MY MEN WOULD NOT BUDGE A STEP FORWARD THEY MUTINIED AND FORMED A SECRET RESOLUTION
THE BAY AT THIS POINT HAD NARROWED FROM TWO MILES TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS IN BREADTH INVITING A CANOE TO SHOW US THE WAY A SMALL FLOTILLA OF CANOES PRECEDED US
FOR IT IS NOTORIOUS THAT THE DOCTOR HAS A FUND OF QUIET HUMOUR WHICH HE EXHIBITS AT ALL TIMES WHENEVER HE IS AMONG FRIENDS I MUST ALSO BEG LEAVE TO CORRECT THE GENTLEMAN WHO INFORMED ME THAT LIVINGSTONE TAKES NO NOTES OR OBSERVATIONS
SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN THE COUNTRY OF LUNDA OR LONDA
THE FOURTH PARTY HAVING GONE WITH EXTRAVAGANT MANIFESTATIONS OF DELIGHT THE MEN WERE HURRIED INTO THE CANOE AND WHEN ALL WERE SEATED AND THE LOOK OUTS EMBARKED WE QUIETLY PUSHED OFF BUT NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON AS THE CANOE WAS GLIDING FROM THE DARKENED LIGHT THAT SURROUNDED US
ONE CHIEF MAKES A RAID INTO THE OTHER'S COUNTRY AND SUCCEEDS IN MAKING OFF WITH A HERD OF CATTLE KILLING ONE OR TWO MEN WHO HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
OUT OF WHICH HE SELDOM AWOKE EXCEPT TO ATTEND TO THE IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL NECESSITIES OF HIMSELF AND PEOPLE THEN RELAPSED AGAIN INTO THE SAME HAPPY INNER WORLD WHICH HE MUST HAVE PEOPLED WITH HIS OWN FRIENDS RELATIONS ACQUAINTANCES
IN MANY OTHER WAYS THE TRAVELLER IN HIS EXTREMITY WAS KINDLY TREATED BY THE YET UNSOPHISTICATED AND INNOCENT NATIVES ON LEAVING THIS HOSPITABLE REGION IN THE EARLY PART OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
IF NOT YOUR TIME IS LOST AND YOU WILL ONLY ANNOY ME I SHALL SEEM TO YOU STUPID AND THE REPUTATION I HAVE FALSE ALL MY GOOD IS MAGNETIC AND I EDUCATE NOT BY LESSONS
BEING ADDICTED TO LAUGHING CONTINUALLY THERE WAS NO MISTAKING HIM THOUGH HE WAS NOW DECORATED WITH MANY IVORY ORNAMENTS WITH NECKLACES AND WITH HEAVY BRASS BRACELETS AND IRON WIRE ANKLETS OUR ADMIRATION OF HIM WAS RECIPROCATED
YOU BOMBAY SEND TWO MEN OFF TO WARN THE DOCTOR AND TELL HIM TO HURRY UP HERE BUT JUST AT THIS PERIOD THE DOCTOR AND HIS TWO MEN APPEARED ON THE BROW OF THE HILL LOOKING DOWN IN A MOST COMPLACENT MANNER UPON THE SERIO COMIC SCENE
BILALI THE STUTTERING COWARD A BULLY OF WOMEN HAD CAUSED A TUMULT IN THE MARKET PLACE AND HAD BEEN SHARPLY BELABOURED WITH THE STICK BY MABRUKI AND ABOVE ALL MOST WELCOME WAS A LETTER I RECEIVED FROM THE AMERICAN CONSUL AT ZANZIBAR
SIR RODERICK MURCHISON TO THE STERN DICTATES OF DUTY ALONE HAS HE SACRIFICED HIS HOME AND EASE THE PLEASURES REFINEMENTS AND LUXURIES OF CIVILIZED LIFE HIS IS THE SPARTAN HEROISM
THROUGH HIS COUNTRY UNDISTURBED AND UNMOLESTED HE WAS THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN HE HAD SEEN HE SAID AND HE LIKED HIM SHORTLY AFTER HIS INTRODUCTION TO THE KING THE QUEEN ENTERED THE LARGE HOUSE SURROUNDED BY A BODY GUARD OF AMAZONS WITH SPEARS
AND THE EFFORT TO GNAW AT THE CORN EARS HAD LOOSENED ALL HIS TEETH I PREFERRED THE CORN SCONES OF VIRGINIA WHICH TO MY MIND WERE THE NEAREST APPROACH TO PALATABLE BREAD OBTAINABLE IN CENTRAL AFRICA
IF I CAN WITH MEANS YOUNG MISTER BENNETT TOLD YOU TO COME AFTER ME TO FIND ME OUT AND HELP ME IT IS NO WONDER THEN YOU PRAISED MISTER BENNETT SO MUCH LAST NIGHT I KNOW HIM I AM PROUD TO SAY
THIS IS MY BELIEF BASED UPON REPORTS OF THE ARABS AND A TEST I MADE OF THE FLOW WITH WATER PLANTS BUT
THAT I DID NOT PROCEED DIRECTLY UPON THE SEARCH MISSION I HAD MANY TASKS TO FULFIL BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH IT AND MANY THOUSAND MILES TO TRAVEL OVER SUPPOSING THAT I HAD GONE DIRECT TO ZANZIBAR FROM PARIS
SHALL BRING BREAKFAST IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION YOU HAVE GIVEN ME AN APPETITE HE SAID HALIMAH IS MY COOK
YOU MAY COMMAND ME FREELY I DRESSED MYSELF QUIETLY INTENDING TO TAKE A STROLL ALONG THE TANGANIKA BEFORE THE DOCTOR SHOULD RISE OPENED THE DOOR WHICH CREAKED HORRIBLY ON ITS HINGES
IN MAKING ALL FORBEAR BLOODSHED WHILE THERE WAS LEFT THE LEAST CHANCE OF AN AMICABLE SETTLEMENT AND IN THE END IT PREVAILED THE SULTAN AND HIS SON WERE BOTH SENT ON THEIR WAY REJOICING WHILE THE DOCTOR CONVERSED WITH THEM AND ENDEAVOURED TO CALM THEIR FIERCE PASSIONS
AND REFLECTING ON EVERY IDEA WHICH EITHER OBSERVATION OR EXPERIENCE OR DISCOURSE HAS PRODUCED GAINS NEW INFORMATION BY EVERY REFLECTION THE INTELLECT CONTEMPLATES ALL THE FORMER SCENES OF LIFE
IN HIS INSANE FURY HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO SLASH AT ONE OF MY MEN WITH A BILLHOOK HE CARRIED THIS HAD BEEN TAKEN AS A DECLARATION OF HOSTILITIES AND THE SOLDIERS WERE READY ENOUGH TO ENGAGE IN WAR BUT THERE WAS NO NECESSITY TO COMMENCE FIGHTING WITH A DRUNKEN MOB
I SHALL TELL HIM THIS MORNING WHO SENT ME AND WHAT BROUGHT ME HERE I WILL THEN ASK HIM TO WRITE A LETTER TO MISTER BENNETT AND TO GIVE WHAT NEWS HE CAN SPARE I DID NOT COME HERE TO ROB HIM OF HIS NEWS
TAKE THAT AND THAT AND THAT STILL SUSI SLEPT AND GRUNTED
THESE WERE MUKAMBA'S AND IN ONE OF THEM LIVED MUKAMBA THE CHIEF
CHARGING HIM WITH A DESIRE TO HAVE THEM ALL KILLED
WE STOPPED AT THE SMALL FISHING VILLAGE OF MUGEYO WHERE WE WERE PERMITTED TO SLEEP UNMOLESTED
TAKING THEM AS AN EXPERIMENT SIX CAMELS THREE BUFFALOES TWO MULES AND THREE DONKEYS HE HAD THUS THIRTY MEN WITH HIM TWELVE OF WHOM VIZ THE SEPOYS WERE TO ACT AS GUARDS FOR THE EXPEDITION
BUT NOT WITHOUT HAVING FIRST FURNISHED THEM WITH THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THE COAST THESE MEN WERE SUCH A DISREPUTABLE SET THAT THE NATIVES SPOKE OF THEM AS THE DOCTOR'S SLAVES ONE OF THEIR WORST SINS WAS THE CUSTOM OF GIVING THEIR GUNS AND AMMUNITION
AS IT WAS THE SECOND CAMP FROM MUKUNGU BECAUSE WITH THEM A HALT IN THE COOL SHADE OF PLAINTAINS WAS INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO SITTING LIKE CARVED PIECES OF WOOD IN A CRANKY CANOE BUT BEFORE THEY STATED THEIR OBJECTIONS AND PREFERENCES
AS IT WAS A FINE MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND WE WERE FULLY ALIVE TO THE DANGEROUS POSITION IN WHICH WE MIGHT FIND OURSELVES THEY CONSENTED TO PULL AN HOUR OR TWO MORE ABOUT ONE P M WE PULLED IN SHORE FOR A DESERTED SPOT
FROM THE BANKS I COUNTED TEN HEADS OF CROCODILES
BUT LIVINGSTONE THOUGH HE SAID NOTHING YET SHOWED PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT HE DID NOT QUITE APPROVE OF THIS AS THESE DEMONSTRATIONS OF HOSTILITY WERE ANYTHING BUT WELCOME AND AS WE SAW SIGNS OF IT ALMOST EVERY TIME WE CAME OPPOSITE A VILLAGE
THE MAN WAS NOT AN APPARITION THEN AND YESTERDAY'S SCENES WERE NOT THE RESULT OF A DREAM AND I GAZED ON HIM INTENTLY FOR THUS I WAS ASSURED HE HAD NOT RUN AWAY
THEY WERE MOSTLY ARMED WITH THE ENFIELD RIFLES PRESENTED TO THE DOCTOR BY THE BOMBAY GOVERNMENT THE BAGGAGE OF THE EXPEDITION CONSISTED OF TEN BALES OF CLOTH AND TWO BAGS OF BEADS
THEN WESTWARD TO KAWENDI THEN NORTHWARD TO UVINZA THEN WESTWARD TO UJIJI ONLY ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER THE DOCTOR'S ARRIVAL TO FIND HIM RESTING UNDER THE VERANDA OF HIS HOUSE
WHERE HE HAD BEEN PUT TO SCHOOL SO THAT SHOULD HE AT ANY TIME FEEL DISPOSED
WHEN WEARIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF WILD TROPIC SCENES SUCH AS THESE WE HAVE BUT TO LIFT OUR EYES TO THE GREAT MOUNTAIN TOPS LOOMING DARKLY AND GRANDLY ON OUR RIGHT TO WATCH THE LIGHT PENCILLING OF THE CIRRUS BRUSHING THEIR SUMMITS
HE HAD HEARD THAT THE WHITE MAN HAD COME TO LOOK FOR WATERS FOR RIVERS AND SEAS THOUGH HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WHITE MAN COULD WANT WITH SUCH THINGS HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE OBJECT WAS GOOD
I WISH I COULD EMBODY MY THANKS TO MISTER BENNETT IN SUITABLE WORDS BUT IF I FAIL TO DO SO DO NOT I BEG OF YOU BELIEVE ME THE LESS GRATEFUL AND NOW DOCTOR HAVING DISPOSED OF THIS LITTLE AFFAIR FERAJJI
AND REDUCING TO NIL THE FRUITS OF LONG YEARS OF LABOR BY SHARPLY POINTED SHAFTS OF RIDICULE AND SNEERS
NO HARASSING ANXIETIES DISTRACTION OF MIND LONG SEPARATION FROM HOME AND KINDRED CAN MAKE HIM COMPLAIN HE THINKS ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT AT LAST HE HAS SUCH FAITH IN THE GOODNESS OF PROVIDENCE
WILL HE NOT DO A FRIENDLY PART BY ME WHAT SAYS THE POET NOR HOPE TO FIND A FRIEND BUT WHO HAS FOUND A FRIEND IN THEE ALL LIKE THE PURCHASE FEW THE PRICE WILL PAY
HOW CONDUCT HERSELF UNDER QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD BE MUCH MORE SEARCHING NOW THAN BEFORE SHE COULD NOT EVEN DECIDE IN HER OWN MIND SHE MUST LET IMPULSE HAVE ITS WAY HAPPILY SHE TOOK THE RIGHT STAND AT FIRST
BUT DO NOT STRUGGLE TOO RELENTLESSLY
TO NIGHT CONSCIOUS THOUGH I AM THAT YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DENY ME THIS REQUEST AND THAT MY DEBT TO YOU ALREADY PASSES THE BOUND OF PRESUMPTION ON MY PART AND INDULGENCE ON YOURS
WERE HE LOVER HUSBAND OR SON SO AMABEL BELIEVED AND SO WOULD THESE OTHERS BELIEVE ALSO WHEN ONCE RELIEVED OF THE MAGNETIC PERSONALITY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY WITNESS
THAT YOU WILL NOT BE THE LOSER BY THIS MATERIAL PROOF OF CONFIDENCE IN ME AS I SHALL SOON BE IN A POSITION TO REPAY ALL MY DEBTS AMONG WHICH
CAN NEVER TAKE PLACE I HAVE GIVEN MY SOLEMN PROMISE TO WELL WELL
THIS YOU WILL BELIEVE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I WAS THE PERSON MISS PAGE FOLLOWED INTO MISSUS WEBB'S HOUSE AND WHOM SHE HEARD DESCEND THE STAIRS DURING THE MOMENT SHE CROUCHED BEHIND THE FIGURE OF THE SLEEPING PHILEMON IT WAS MORE
HE WHISPERED IT GOES INTO OTHER HANDS MISTER SUTHERLAND WHO HAD TURNED OVER THE DOCUMENT AS HIS SON APPROACHED BREATHED MORE EASILY TAKING UP HIS PEN HE DIPPED IT IN THE INK FREDERICK WATCHED HIM WITH CONSTANTLY WHITENING CHEEK
AM I SO HARD TO TALK TO THAT THE WORDS WILL NOT LEAVE YOUR LIPS I HAVE PROMISED MY FATHER I WILL NEVER MARRY YOU HE FEELS THAT HE HAS GROUNDS OF COMPLAINT AGAINST YOU AND AS I OWE HIM EVERYTHING
IT IS A SACRED STORY TO ME AND IF YOU MUST KNOW IT LET IT BE FROM HER OWN WORDS IN THE LETTERS SHE LEFT BEHIND HER SHE ONLY TOLD ME THAT TO SAVE ME FROM THE FATE OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAD PRECEDED ME
THAT SHE WAS STILL IN THE MAZE OF THE NUMBERLESS CONFLICTING EMOTIONS WHICH THESE REVELATIONS WERE CALCULATED TO CALL OUT IN ONE WHO HAD RISKED ALL ON THE HAZARD OF A DIE AND LOST SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW AT THIS MOMENT WHETHER SHE WAS GLAD OR SORRY HE COULD EXPLAIN SO CLEVERLY
AND I BEGIN TO THINK IT DOES BUT LISTEN SUTHERLAND SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME BEGAN TO REGARD HER WITH ANYTHING BUT A LOVER'S EYES I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN SIGHT AT THAT TIME SHE CONTINUED YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE WORLD AT LARGE FEAR
OR THAT I WAS THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF HER ATTENTION OR THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN ANY WAY WHY THEN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING TO HER IN THE GREAT STRAIT IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ON THAT DAY
FOR WHILE SHE HAD HITHERTO SAT UNDER THE UNIVERSAL GAZE WITH ONLY THE FAINT SMILE OF CONSCIOUS BEAUTY ON HER INSCRUTABLE FEATURES
THE STEP ON THE WALK HAD MOUNTED TO THE FRONT DOOR NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY INQUIRED THE FATHER NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ANSWERED THE SON THE JUDGE
AND HAD ALMOST TOUCHED HIS FINGER IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION OF ASSENT WHICH AMABEL AWAITED WITH BREATHLESS EXPECTATION WHEN WAS IT MIRACLE OR ONLY THE SUGGESTION OF HIS BETTER NATURE
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU SAW ME DO SAID HE BUT WHATEVER IT WAS IT CAN MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN OUR RELATIONS HER WHISPER WHICH HAD BEEN BUT A BREATH BEFORE
FOR FEAR IT WOULD MAKE HER LAST MOMENTS MISERABLE
I WILL BE BACK BEFORE MIDNIGHT AND HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN STAIRS JUST AS THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND WATTLES STEPPED IN AH
AND TOLD HIM OF THE STRANGE AND HEART RENDING ADVENTURE WHICH HAD CHANGED THE WHOLE TENOR OF MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE
I DID NOT PAUSE AT THE GATE YOU ENTERED SAID SHE
AND SHE MADE ME PROMISE I WOULD CARE FOR HIM TO THE LAST WITH TENDERNESS SAYING THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT SEEMING IMPROPRIETY SINCE SHE HAD WILLED ME ALL HER FORTUNE UNDER THIS PROVISO FINALLY
IS IT AS WELL DONE AS THE ONE YOU TRIED TO PASS OFF ON BRADY FREDERICK CRINGED AND FOR A MOMENT LOOKED AS IF THE STRUGGLE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM
THE ASTOUNDING FACT WHICH I HAVE JUST COMMUNICATED TO YOU WAS MADE KNOWN BY MY MOTHER WITH THE DAGGER STILL PLUNGED IN HER BREAST SHE WOULD NOT LET ME DRAW IT OUT SHE KNEW THAT DEATH WOULD FOLLOW THAT ACT
WAS ALMOST APPALLING IN ITS INTENSITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISTER SUTHERLAND'S NEAR PRESENCE THE FEELING WOULD HAVE RISEN TO OUTBREAK AND MANY VOICES WERE HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS VENERATED MAN'S LAST LOOK
AND THE INVOLUNTARY OPENING AND SHUTTING OF HIS HANDS REVEALED THE EMOTION UNDER WHICH HE WAS LABOURING
I DO NOT ALLUDE TO OUR TALK OR OR IN THE ONE DANCE WE HAD FREDERICK
AS FOR ME WHO HAVE NOT BEEN AS WISE AS YOU FREDERICK SHE HAD COME SO NEAR HE DID NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH TO FINISH HER FACE
SHE HAD NOT A PURE ENOUGH HEART TO DO SO TO HER ALL SELF SACRIFICE WAS AN ANOMALY NO WOMAN OF THE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF AGATHA WEBB WOULD PLANT A DAGGER IN HER OWN BREAST JUST TO PREVENT ANOTHER PERSON FROM COMMITTING A CRIME
WHICH MADE ANY ATTEMPT SEEM REASONABLE THAT PROMISED RELIEF FROM THE UNENDURABLE BURDEN OF A PRESSING AND DISREPUTABLE DEBT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE MONEY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT AT ONCE
HESITATING STROKES RANG OUT SWEETWATER SAW FREDERICK YIELD TO A SUDDEN BUT MOST PROFOUND EMOTION THE OLD FEAR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IF SWEETWATER DID NOT HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE VICTIM OF AMABEL'S AMBITION
IT WAS TO FIND IN TWO FACES ONLY ANY SIGNS OF THE EAGERNESS AND EXPECTANCY WHICH FILLED HIS OWN BREAST TO SUFFOCATION BUT AS THESE FACES WERE THOSE OF AGNES HALLIDAY AND AMABEL PAGE
I HAVE MADE AN ASSERTION SAID HE BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE THIS JURY TO MAKE IT SEEM A CREDIBLE ONE I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MY OWN STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AM I ALLOWED TO DO SO MISTER CORONER YOU ARE
HE DROPPED THE PAPER WITH AN ALACRITY WHICH FREDERICK WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTICE FATHER HE BEGAN WITHOUT PREAMBLE OR EXCUSE
FOR SHE NEVER HAD LOOKED SO HANDSOME OR SO GLOWING INSTEAD OF SHOWING DEPRESSION OR HUMILIATION EVEN
WHAT I MUST NOW EXPLAIN IS HOW THE MONEY IN MISSUS WEBB'S DRAWER CAME INTO MY POSSESSION AND HOW THE DAGGER SHE HAD PLANTED IN HER BREAST CAME TO BE FOUND ON THE LAWN OUTSIDE WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SOON I FOUND
HER VOICE AS I HAVE BEFORE SAID
THE WORD SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM WITH THE FORCE OF A BLOW INNOCENT HE REPEATED INNOCENT BECOMING PALER STILL AS THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER MEANING BROKE GRADUALLY UPON HIM
HE DID NOT LOSE HIS DETERMINED ATTITUDE HE HAD OBSERVED A CHANGE IN AMABEL AND A CHANGE IN AGNES AND IF ONLY TO DISAPPOINT THE VILE TRIUMPH OF THE ONE
NOW AND THEN BUT ALWAYS AS IF YOU DID NOT MEAN IT
WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
AND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREAST
YOU THINK YOU OUGHT NOT TO MARRY ME AFTER WHAT TOOK PLACE LAST NIGHT
AND GRADUALLY SUBSIDE SO THIS CROWD YIELDED TO ITS AWE AND MAN BY MAN SANK BACK INTO HIS SEAT TILL QUIET WAS AGAIN RESTORED AND ONLY A CIRCLE OF LISTENING FACES CONFRONTED THE MAN WHO HAD JUST STIRRED A WHOLE ROOMFUL TO ITS DEPTHS
IN CASE MY PRESENCE IN THIS HOUSE OF DEATH SHOULD BECOME KNOWN
I WILL SOON PROVE ITS VALUE IN YOUR EYES FOLLOW ME UP STAIRS TO MY FATHER HIS ENERGY THE ENERGY OF DESPAIR NO DOUBT SEEMED TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON THE OTHER
SHE WENT ON BUT PREVIOUS TO THAT TIME
DON'T STAIN YOURS DON'T I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I THOUGHT IT OVER AFTERWARD THAT MY HAND WAS THRUST CONVULSIVELY INTO MY BREAST IN A WAY WHICH TAKEN WITH MY WILD MIEN
BUT HARDLY UNDERSTAND HOW I HAVE EARNED IT
INDEED EVERY COMFORT AND LUXURY HAD BEEN SHOWERED UPON HIS HEAD TO COMPENSATE HIM FOR HIS LOST BRIDE THIS WAS THE THIRD TIME THAT HE HAD BEEN BY NAME INVITED TO DRINK HIS WINE AND THREE TIMES HE HAD OBEYED
NO MY DEAR NO BUT DO NOT ALLOW HER TO SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY ELSE CAN PUT IT THERE EITHER LET THE MATTER GO ON SHE WILL SEE THE THINGS BOUGHT FOR HER WEDDING AND WHEN SHE REMEMBERS THAT SHE HAS ALLOWED THEM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE WITHOUT REMONSTRATING
WHY SHOULD I WISH TO BE MARRIED IF I LIKED HIM I WOULD TAKE HIM BUT I DON'T O AUNT JOSEY I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE MY FRIEND I CANNOT BE YOUR FRIEND MARIE IF YOU OPPOSE YOUR UNCLE HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING FOR YOU AND HE MUST KNOW BEST WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU
YOUR UNCLE WON'T BE UP YET THEN SHE LED THE WAY AND MARIE FOLLOWED HER YOUR UNCLE IS BECOMING ANGRY MARIE BECAUSE BECAUSE WHY HAVE I DONE ANYTHING TO MAKE HIM ANGRY
NO ROMANCE NO KISSING OF HANDS NO LOOKING INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES NO HALF MURMURED TONES OF LOVE MADAME VOSS BELIEVED STRONGLY THAT THE EVERY DAY WORK OF THE WORLD WAS DONE BETTER WITHOUT ANY OF THESE GLANCINGS AND GLIMMERINGS OF MOONSHINE
SHE BRUSHED THE CRUMBS FROM THE LONG TABLE AND SMOOTHED THE CLOTH FOR THE NEXT MORNING'S BREAKFAST SHE PUT AWAY BOTTLES AND DISHES AND SHE LOCKED UP CUPBOARDS AND SAW THAT THE WINDOWS AND THE DOORS WERE FASTENED THEN SHE WENT DOWN TO HER BOOKS IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BELOW STAIRS
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT HER UNCLE SHOULD BE INFORMED OF HER PURPOSE WHEN HE HAD COME TO HER AFTER THE WALK AND DEMANDED OF HER WHETHER SHE STILL INTENDED TO MARRY ADRIAN URMAND SHE HAD ANSWERED HIM FALSELY I SUPPOSE SO SHE HAD SAID
EVERYTHING WENT AS WELL AS COULD HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED THEY MANAGED TO DELAY THEIR DEPARTURE TILL NEARLY HALF PAST TWELVE
IS IT THAT AUNT JOSEY THAT MAKES MY UNCLE GO ON LIKE THIS ASKED MARIE YOU DO NOT ANSWER ME CHILD
MADAME VOSS WAS NO DOUBT INSIDE AS WAS ALSO MARIE BROMAR THEN THE MAN COMMENCED AN ELABORATE ACCOUNT OF THE BETROTHALS THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AT GRANPERE ANY MARRIAGE THAT HAD BEEN HALF SO IMPORTANT AS WOULD BE THIS MARRIAGE
I DO NOT BLAME HIM FOR IT SHE LIVES IN THE HOUSE WITH HIM WHILE I LIVE ELSEWHERE IT WAS NATURAL THAT SHE SHOULD BE MORE TO HIM THAN I AM
THERE WERE MANY THINGS ABOUT THE HOUSE WHICH IT WAS HER CUSTOM TO SEE IN THEIR PLACE BEFORE SHE WENT TO HER REST AND NOBODY SHOULD SAY THAT SHE NEGLECTED HER WORK BECAUSE OF THIS DRESSED UP DOLL BUT SHE WOULD WAIT TILL SHE WAS SURE OF HIM TILL SHE WAS SURE OF HER UNCLE ALSO
AND THIS THEREFORE GAVE RISE TO NO SPECIAL REMARK
WHEN SHE SWORE TO HIM THAT SHE WOULD BE HIS FOR EVER AND EVER AFTER THAT HE HAD LEFT HER
AND TO WHOM WAS HE TO SAY IT WHEN HE REACHED THE ANGULAR COURT ALONG TWO SIDES OF WHICH THE HOUSE WAS BUILT HE DID NOT AT ONCE ENTER THE FRONT DOOR NONE OF THE FAMILY WERE THEN ABOUT THE PLACE
I AM ANGRY WITH HER DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH HER I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SHE DID NOT PUT ON ANOTHER FROCK SO CAN I UNDERSTAND I CAN UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH I AM NOT A FOOL
HE DID NOT GET THROUGH A LINE WITHOUT SUNDRY INTERRUPTIONS WHICH ALL AROSE FROM HIS DETERMINATION TO CONTRADICT AT ONCE EVERY ASSERTION WHICH SHE MADE YOU CANNOT PREVENT HIS COMING HE SAID AND IT SHALL NOT BE PREVENTED
AND THOUGH COLMAR AND BASLE ARE VERY NEAR
BUT MY DEAR IT IS TIME THAT YOU SHOULD BE SETTLED IN THE WORLD I AM SETTLED I DON'T WANT ANY OTHER SETTLEMENT IF THEY WILL ONLY LET ME ALONE MARIE SAID MADAME VOSS AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
NO LOVER COMING THITHER HAD EVER BEEN BLESSED WITH SO BEAUTIFUL AND DISCREET A MAIDEN AND NO MAIDEN OF GRANPERE HAD EVER BEFORE HAD AT HER FEET A LOVER AT THE SAME TIME SO GOOD LOOKING SO WEALTHY SO SAGACIOUS AND SO GOOD TEMPERED
AFTER THE BANQUET WAS OVER MARIE EXPRESSED HERSELF SO MUCH TOUCHED AS ALMOST TO INCUR THE JEALOUSY OF HER MORE FORTUNATE LOVER WHEN THE SPEECHES WERE FINISHED THE MEN MADE THEMSELVES HAPPY WITH THEIR CIGARS AND WINE
AND GEORGE ASKED AFTER THE CHILDREN AND IN THIS WAY THE DREADED SUBJECT WAS FOR SOME MINUTES LAID ON ONE SIDE IN THE MEAN TIME INFORMATION OF GEORGE'S ARRIVAL HAD BEEN TAKEN UPSTAIRS TO MARIE
SO LONG COULD SHE RECONCILE TO HERSELF AFTER SOME PAINFUL DUBIOUS FASHION THE IDEA OF BEING THE WIFE EITHER OF ADRIAN URMAND OR OF ANY OTHER MAN
SHE WAS WAITING TILL THE HOUSE SHOULD BE QUIET SO THAT SHE COULD GO DOWN AND COMPLETE HER WORK
BY THIS TIME MARIE WAS SPEAKING ALMOST IN A FURY OF PASSION AND HER AUNT WAS ALMOST SUBDUED BY HER NOBODY IS AFRAID OF YOU MARIE SHE SAID NOBODY NEED BE IF THEY WILL LET ME ALONE I WILL DO NO HARM TO ANY ONE
THE QUESTION SUCH A QUESTION AS IT WAS HAD BEEN PUT TO HER TOO ABRUPTLY TO ADMIT OF A TRUE ANSWER ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT BUT THE FALSEHOOD ALMOST STUCK IN HER THROAT AND WAS A MISERY TO HER TILL SHE COULD SET IT RIGHT
EVEN NOW BE OBEDIENT BUT SHE WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN SHE HAD AT LAST FORMED A RESOLUTION AND HER UNCLE'S WORDS HAD NO EFFECT TOWARDS TURNING HER FROM IT UNCLE MICHEL SHE SAID AT LAST SPEAKING
BUT WHEN SHE HAD LEARNED THE TRUTH A TRUTH SO UNEXPECTED THEN SUCH SERVITUDE BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO HER ON THAT MORNING
THAT GEORGE HAD NOT COME OVER FROM COLMAR SIMPLY TO EXPRESS HIS JOYOUS SATISFACTION AT HIS COUSIN'S GOOD FORTUNE HE SOON WALKED THROUGH INTO THE LITTLE SITTING ROOM AND HIS STEP MOTHER FOLLOWED HIM GEORGE SHE SAID
INTENDING TO OBTAIN A RENEWED PLEDGE FROM HER THAT SHE WOULD BE TRUE TO HER ENGAGEMENT BUT HE HAD BEEN SO FULL OF PASSION SO BESIDE HIMSELF WITH EXCITEMENT SO DISTURBED BY ALL THAT HE HAD HEARD
I CARE NOTHING FOR GEORGE SAID MARIE AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM NOTHING AT ALL NOTHING ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LISTENING AT HER OWN DOOR SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF HER UNCLE'S FEET AS HE WENT TO HIS ROOM AND KNEW THAT THE HOUSE WAS QUIET
IT SEEMED TO BE CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD NOT STAY LONG HE STARTED ALL ALONE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND REACHED GRANPERE ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK HIS MIND WAS FULL OF PAINFUL THOUGHTS AS HE WENT
I AM AFRAID YOU WILL BE ANGRY WITH ME AND TURN ME AWAY BUT I CANNOT HELP IT THE LETTER WAS AS FOLLOWS
WHEN HE MET MARIE ABOUT THE HOUSE JUST BEFORE SUPPER HE PUT HIS HAND UPON HER SHOULDER AND SMILED AND MURMURED SOME WORD OF LOVE HE WAS BY NO MEANS CRAFTY IN WHAT HE DID CRAFT INDEED WAS NOT THE STRONG POINT OF HIS CHARACTER
WHAT IS A PERSON TO THINK GEORGE
POOR MARIE ALL THAT SHE WANTED NOW AT THIS MOMENT WAS TO BE LET ALONE
BUT MICHEL VOSS THOUGH HE WAS HEAPING ABUSE UPON HER WITH THE HOPE THAT HE MIGHT THUS ACHIEVE HIS PURPOSE HAD NOT THE REMOTEST IDEA OF SEVERING THE CONNECTION WHICH BOUND HIM AND HER TOGETHER HE WANTED TO DO HER GOOD NOT EVIL
MADAME VOSS IN OBEDIENCE TO HER HUSBAND'S COMMANDS WENT UP TO MARIE AND FOUND HER SITTING IN THE CHILDREN'S ROOM LEANING WITH HER HEAD ON HER HAND AND HER ELBOW ON THE TABLE WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP AROUND HER
HER AUNT INDEED AND
YES TO DAY OR THIS EVENING AT LEAST BUT I MUST SETTLE SOMETHING FIRST
MARIE BROMAR THE LETTER HAD TAKEN HER LONG TO WRITE AND IT TOOK HER UNCLE LONG TO READ BEFORE HE CAME TO THE END OF IT
HOW PLEASING TO THE MASTER HOW CREDITABLE TO THE VILLAGE HOW SATISFACTORY TO THE FRIENDS HOW JOYOUS TO THE BRIDEGROOM HOW TRIUMPHANT TO THE BRIDE NO DOUBT SHE WILL HAVE PLENTY TO EAT AND DRINK AND FINE CLOTHES TO WEAR
ON THAT VERY MORNING WHILE THE MEN HAD BEEN UP IN THE MOUNTAIN SHE HAD SAT WITH HER AUNT HEMMING SHEETS INTENDED AS AN ADDITION TO THE ALREADY OVERFLOWING STOCK
AND AS THE LITTLE ANIMAL RAN QUICKLY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROAD INTO THE VALLEY IN WHICH GRANPERE LIES HE ALMOST WISHED THAT HIS FEET WERE NOT SO FLEET
HAD HE COME BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD OF THE BETROTHALS HE ADMITTED THAT IT WAS SO
YOU GAVE HIM A SORT OF A PROMISE AND NOW HE THINKS THAT YOU ARE BREAKING IT I GAVE HIM NO PROMISE SAID MARIE STOUTLY
MARIE HAD THOUGHT OF THAT ALSO AND WAS AWARE THAT SHE MUST LOSE NO TIME IN MAKING HER PURPOSE KNOWN SO THAT ARTICLES WHICH WOULD BE UNNECESSARY MIGHT NOT BE PURCHASED
SAID HE I SHALL NOT BE HERE THEN AH YOUR FATHER WILL MISS YOU SO MUCH BUT IF IT CANNOT BE IT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME NOW
OF COURSE I FEEL IT A LITTLE
DOES THAT MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT TO BE HERE FOR MY MARRIAGE THIS SHE SAID WITH HER SWEETEST SMILE MAKING ALL THE EFFORT IN HER POWER TO GIVE A GRACIOUS TONE TO HER VOICE IT WAS BETTER SHE KNEW TO PLUNGE AT THE SUBJECT AT ONCE NO
BUT LYCAS REMEMBERED THE SEDUCTION OF HIS WIFE AND THE INSULTS TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED IN THE PORTICO OF THE TEMPLE OF HERCULES
SO HE DESCENDED INTO THE TOMB AND CATCHING SIGHT OF A MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN HE STOOD STILL AFRAID AT FIRST THAT IT WAS SOME APPARITION OR SPIRIT FROM THE INFERNAL REGIONS BUT HE FINALLY COMPREHENDED THE TRUE STATE OF AFFAIRS AS HIS EYE TOOK IN THE CORPSE LYING THERE
NOTHING CAN BE MORE INSINCERE THAN THE SILLY PREJUDICES OF MANKIND AND NOTHING SILLIER THAN THE MORALITY OF BIGOTRY
WHEREUPON HE EXPLAINED TO THE ASTONISHED EUMOLPUS THE REASONS FOR THEIR ENMITY AND FOR THE DANGER WHICH THREATENED US
AND THEY STILL STINK OF THE REMNANTS OF MY PATRIMONY THEREUPON FORTY STRIPES WERE ORDERED FOR EACH OF US THAT THE TUTELARY GENIUS OF THE SHIP MIGHT BE PROPITIATED AND THEY WERE NOT LONG ABOUT IT EITHER
CAME A BELLOWING AS OF SOME WILD BEAST TRYING TO GET OUT WE THEN FOLLOWED UP THE SOUND AND DISCOVERED EUMOLPUS SITTING THERE SCRIBBLING VERSES UPON AN IMMENSE SHEET OF PARCHMENT ASTOUNDED THAT HE COULD FIND TIME TO WRITE POETRY AT DEATH'S VERY DOOR
AFTER THESE REFLECTIONS WE MADE READY TO PAY THE LAST RITES TO THE CORPSE AND LYCAS WAS BURNED UPON A FUNERAL PYRE RAISED BY THE HANDS OF ENEMIES WHILE EUMOLPUS FIXING HIS EYES UPON THE FAR DISTANCE TO GAIN INSPIRATION COMPOSED AN EPITAPH FOR THE DEAD MAN
AT LAST THE GALLANT GITON TURNED THE MENACING RAZOR AGAINST HIS OWN VIRILE PARTS AND THREATENED TO CUT AWAY THE CAUSE OF SO MANY MISFORTUNES THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR TRYPHAENA SHE PREVENTED THE PERPETRATION OF SO HORRID A CRIME BY THE OUT AND OUT PROMISE OF QUARTER
SHE SPRANG AT US AND TORE US APART THOROUGHLY ENRAGED AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF HER LECHEROUS PASSION
SHE REPLIED BUT I AM NOT THE SUN CHILD NOR HAS MY MOTHER EVER STAYED THE REVOLVING WORLD IN ITS COURSE AT HER PLEASURE BUT IF THE FATES BRING US TWO TOGETHER I WILL OWE HEAVEN A FAVOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
BUT THAT HE HAD BROUGHT HIS COMPANIONS UPON THIS VOYAGE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD LONG INTENDED TAKING WITH THE MOST UPRIGHT INTENTIONS AND IN THE BEST OF GOOD FAITH BUT DEMANDED HE WHAT IS THIS AMBUSH WHO IS THIS HANNIBAL WHO SAILS WITH US
WHILE I WAS ENGAGED IN THIS DIPLOMATIC EFFORT IN BEHALF OF THE AFFECTED MEMBER A HIDEOUS CRONE WITH DISHEVELED HAIR AND CLAD IN BLACK GARMENTS WHICH WERE IN GREAT DISORDER ENTERED THE SHRINE AND LAYING HANDS UPON ME
THE SOLDIER WAS HOODWINKED WHILE ABSENT FROM HIS POST OF DUTY AND WHEN ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ONE OF THE CROSSES WITHOUT ITS CORPSE HE WAS IN TERROR OF PUNISHMENT AND EXPLAINED TO THE LADY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HE WOULD AWAIT NO SENTENCE OF COURT MARTIAL
EVEN SHOULD HE WISH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE HE WOULD LOSE IT THROUGH LACK OF BREATH WHEN BUT WITHOUT ANY CONFIDENCE I HAD ARRIVED AT THESE CONCLUSIONS AND BEGUILED MY UNEASY SPIRIT I COVERED MY HEAD WITH MY TUNIC AND BEGAN TO FEIGN SLEEP WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
BY SALT WATER AND PASSED A NIGHT THAT WAS ALMOST INTERMINABLE AS WE WERE HOLDING A COUNCIL NEXT DAY TO DETERMINE TO WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY WE HAD BEST PROCEED I SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A HUMAN BODY TURNING AROUND IN A GENTLE EDDY AND FLOATING TOWARDS THE SHORE
SOME WAY OUT MUST BE FOUND UNLESS WE BRING ABOUT A SHIPWRECK AND FREE OURSELVES FROM ALL DANGERS
SKILLFULLY TEARING OFF THE PODS WITH HER TEETH SPAT THEM UPON THE GROUND WHERE THEY LOOKED LIKE DEAD FLIES I WONDERED THEN AT THE INGENUITY OF POVERTY AND ITS EXPEDIENTS FOR EMERGENCY SO ARDENT A FOLLOWER OF THIS VIRTUE
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THE SIRENS HARMONIES WERE FLOATING IN THE BREEZE I WAS STRUCK WITH WONDER AND DAZZLED BY I KNOW NOT WHAT LIGHT THAT SHONE UPON ME BRIGHTER THAN THE WHOLE HEAVEN BUT I MADE BOLD TO INQUIRE THE NAME OF MY DIVINITY WHY
AND QUIVERING CYPRESS AND THE STATELY PLANE AND BERRY LADEN LAUREL A BROOK'S WIMPLING WATERS STRAYED LASHED INTO FOAM
THE IMAGE OF LUNA DRAWN BY MY SPELLS MUST DESCEND AND APOLLO ATREMBLE BACKS UP HIS HORSES AND TURNS FROM HIS COURSE AT MY ORDER
MY MISTRESS BELONGS TO THIS CLASS SHE JUMPS THE FOURTEEN ROWS FROM THE STAGE TO THE GALLERY AND LOOKS FOR A LOVER AMONG THE GALLERY GODS AT THE BACK PUFFED UP WITH THIS DELIGHTFUL CHATTER COME NOW CONFESS WON'T YOU I QUERIED
AGREED ON YOUR PART LYCAS THAT YOU DO REFRAIN FROM ANNOYING ENCOLPIUS WITH ABUSIVE WORD OR REPROACHFUL LOOK THAT YOU DO NOT SEEK TO ASCERTAIN WHERE HE SLEEP AT NIGHT
WHEN PRESSED TO EAT OR TO LIVE NO ONE LISTENS UNWILLINGLY AND THE LADY THIRSTY AFTER AN ABSTINENCE OF SEVERAL DAYS FINALLY PERMITTED HER OBSTINACY TO BE OVERCOME NOR DID SHE TAKE HER FILL OF NOURISHMENT WITH LESS AVIDITY THAN HAD THE MAID WHO HAD SURRENDERED FIRST
UNITED PRAYERS CLIMB BEST IS THE BELIEF SHE SEATED HERSELF UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED AND IN QUAVERING TONES COMMENCED TO ACCUSE THE DELAYS OF OLD AGE AT LAST THE PRIESTESS CAME IN
AND BACCHUS WITH THE FRUITFUL VINE TO CROWN
WE HAULED HIM OUT IN SPITE OF HIS PROTESTS AND ORDERED HIM TO RETURN TO HIS SENSES BUT HE FLEW INTO A RAGE AT BEING INTERRUPTED LEAVE ME ALONE UNTIL I FINISH THIS SENTENCE HE BAWLED THE POEM LABORS TO ITS BIRTH
AND SERVED UP A VERY DELECTABLE DINNER FOR ME WHOM BUT A MOMENT BEFORE SHE HAD HERSELF CONDEMNED TO DEATH IN HER OWN WORDS
OR ONLY A DREAM AS WHEN IN THE SLEEP BRINGING NIGHT DREAMS SPORT WITH THE WANDERING EYES AND EARTH SPADED UP
LET HIM SHAVE YOUR HEADS AND EYEBROWS TOO AND QUICKLY AT THAT I WILL FOLLOW AFTER HIM AND I WILL MARK MY INSCRIPTION SO CLEVERLY UPON YOUR FOREHEADS THAT YOU WILL BE MISTAKEN FOR SLAVES WHO HAVE BEEN BRANDED THE SAME LETTERS WILL
THOUGHT LIGHTLY OF DORIS OH JOVE WHAT'S COME TO PASS THAT THOU THINE ARMOR CAST AWAY ART MUTE IN HEAVEN AND BUT AN IDLE TALE AT SUCH A TIME THE HORNS SHOULD SPROUT THE RAGING BULL HOLD SWAY
AS THOUGH I WERE ENVELOPED IN SOME TURBULENT NIGHTMARE WAS A LONG TIME FINDING MY VOICE BUT AT LAST WITH TREMBLING HANDS I TUGGED AT THE HEM OF EUMOLPUS CLOTHING JUST AS HE WAS SINKING INTO SLUMBER FATHER I QUAVERED ON YOUR WORD OF HONOR
CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIXTH IN THE MEANTIME HAVING SHELLED THE BEANS SHE TOOK A MOUTHFUL OF THE MEAT AND WITH THE FORK WAS REPLACING THE PIG'S CHEEK WHICH WAS COEVAL WITH HERSELF
SIGNED A TREATY OF PEACE WHICH WAS DRAWN UP AS FOLLOWS
AND THE PILOT MAY BE MOVED TO MERCY AND GRANT YOUR PRAYER EUMOLPUS DENIED THE PRACTICABILITY OF THIS IT IS ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY AFFIRMED HE THAT LARGE SHIPS ARE WARPED INTO LANDLOCKED HARBORS
HOW EASILY THEY FELL IN LOVE HOW READILY THEY FORGOT EVEN THEIR OWN SONS NO WOMAN COULD BE SO CHASTE BUT THAT SHE COULD BE ROUSED TO MADNESS BY A CHANCE PASSION
WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO YOU WHEN I'VE INFORMED YOU THAT LYCAS OF TARENTUM IS MASTER OF THIS SHIP AND THAT HE CARRIES TRYPHAENA AS AN EXILE TO TARENTUM CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIRST I SHIVERED HORROR STRUCK AT THIS THUNDERBOLT AND
THEN PRODUCING SOME EYEBROWS FROM A VANITY BOX SHE SKILLFULLY TRACED OUT THE LINES OF THE LOST FEATURES AND RESTORED HIM TO HIS PROPER COMELINESS
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CITY THERE WAS BUT ONE OPINION MEN OF EVERY CALLING AGREED THAT HERE SHONE THE ONE SOLITARY EXAMPLE OF CHASTITY AND OF LOVE IN THE MEANTIME THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE HAD ORDERED SOME ROBBERS CRUCIFIED NEAR THE LITTLE VAULT IN WHICH THE LADY WAS BEWAILING HER RECENT LOSS
STILL UNSATISFIED WITH THE DRASTIC PUNISHMENT SHE HAD INFLICTED UPON ME SHE CALLED ALL THE SPINNING WOMEN AND SCRUBBING WENCHES IN THE HOUSE AND ORDERED THEM TO SPIT UPON ME I COVERED MY FACE WITH MY HANDS BUT I UTTERED NO COMPLAINT
AND I RETURNED HOME ARRIVED THERE I FEIGNED ILLNESS AND THREW MYSELF UPON MY COUCH A LITTLE LATE GITON WHO HAD HEARD OF MY INDISPOSITION ENTERED THE ROOM IN SOME CONCERN AS I WISHED TO RELIEVE HIS MIND
I INFORMED HIM THAT I HAD MERELY SOUGHT MY PALLET TO TAKE A REST TELLING HIM MUCH OTHER GOSSIP BUT NOT A WORD ABOUT MY MISHAP AS I STOOD IN GREAT FEAR OF HIS JEALOUSY AND TO LULL ANY SUSPICION WHICH HE MIGHT ENTERTAIN I DREW HIM TO MY SIDE
ONE TRIED TO HARPOON THE LEAPING FISH ANOTHER HAULED IN THE STRUGGLING CATCH ON BAITED HOOKS
I WILL COME IN ON THE SAME FOOTING ONLY DEEM MY KISSES WORTHY OF RECOGNITION AND CARESS ME AT YOUR OWN PLEASURE RATHER LET ME IMPLORE YOU BY YOUR BEAUTY I REPLIED
THAT IS A PROOF OF LOVE NOT OF MALIGNITY LET US TAKE SUCH PRECAUTIONS THAT NOT A SOUL WILL FIND THIS OUT AS FOR YOU PRAY TO THE GODS TO FORGIVE YOUR SACRILEGE THE RICH MAN CAN SAIL IN A FAVORING GALE
SHUTTING THE DOORS OF THE VAULT OF COURSE SO THAT ANYONE ACQUAINTANCE OR STRANGER COMING TO THE TOMB WOULD BE CONVINCED THAT THIS MOST VIRTUOUS OF WIVES HAD EXPIRED UPON THE BODY OF HER HUSBAND AS FOR THE SOLDIER SO DELIGHTED WAS HE WITH THE BEAUTY OF HIS MISTRESS AND THE SECRECY OF THE INTRIGUE
THAT HE MIGHT SHAVE THEM CLEAN EUMOLPUS COVERED OUR FOREHEADS COMPLETELY WITH LARGE LETTERS AND
TO LOSE ACTUAL INCHES I THOUGHT IT A WONDERFUL EXHIBITION THE VERY NEXT INSTANT THERE CAME A GROAN FROM SHIRLEY SOMETHING WHICH AT ONCE INDICATED PAIN AND REALIZATION AND FEAR HE LOST ALL CONTROL OF HIMSELF
NO THE POLICE OFFICER'S EYES TWINKLED THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THE IRISH IN HIM TO ENJOY AN ENCOUNTER OF THIS KIND MAYBE NOT BUT YOU MIGHT FIND THINGS IN A CHAP'S POCKET WHICH IS BETTER WITH A FLOURISH HE PRODUCED A HYPODERMIC SYRINGE
IF YOU CAN PROVE WHO THE MURDERER IS MISTER KENNEDY HE EXPLODED WHY DON'T YOU APPREHEND HIM BEFORE SOME ONE ELSE MEETS THE FATE OF WERNER I CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL I RETURN TO MY LABORATORY THIS AFTERNOON
KENNEDY DID NOT LOOK AT ME
IT'S TOO BAD EVERYONE WASN'T SEARCHED AT THAT KENNEDY ADMITTED
THAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR QUARREL PERHAPS SHE HAD THREATENED TO MAKE TROUBLE
I GATHERED FROM THE LOOK OF DISGUST ON MILLARD'S FACE THAT HE WANTED TO GET SHIRLEY OUT OF THE SET BEFORE KENNEDY SHOULD OBSERVE THE HEAVY MAN'S ODD REACTION TO THE TRAGEDY
MISS LORING TOLD US THAT SHIRLEY SUSPECTED SOME ONE AND WAS WATCHING AND WOULD NOT TELL HER OR ANYONE ELSE WHO IT WAS IT SEEMS MOST LIKELY TO ME THAT IT IS THE TRUTH MACKAY
LITERALLY ACTUALLY WERNER'S BODY COULD NOT BE COLD EVEN THE POLICE THE MEDICAL EXAMINER HAD NOT HAD SUFFICIENT TIME TO MAKE THE TRIP OUT FOR THEIR INVESTIGATION YET THE DIRECTOR'S SUCCESSOR HAD BEEN APPOINTED AND TOLD TO HURRY THE PRODUCTION
THE IDEA OF ANY DRUG ADDICT EVER FORGETTING TO TAKE HIS STIMULANT WAS TOO PREPOSTEROUS BUT KENNEDY CHECKED ME ALL WERE NOW KEENLY LISTENING TO THE ARGUMENT
HE MUTTERED WHY KENNEDY'S MOUTH TIGHTENED THE FINANCIER GREW RED BECAUSE THIS PICTURE HAS BEEN CRIPPLED ENOUGH FIRST A NEW STAR NOW A NEW DIRECTOR
AS BELLE DESCRIBED IT HIS FACE GRADUALLY BECAME MORE AND MORE RED
THE MOST NERVOUS OF ALL AND AND FINALLY HE HAD A MOTIVE HE WANTED TO GET ENID FAYE WITH MANTON PICTURES AS THIS NOTE SHOWS VERY GOOD WALTER KENNEDY'S EYES WERE DANCING IN AMUSEMENT
BUT HE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO COMPARE NOTES WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
THIS SEEMED UNINTERESTING TO ME
HE SAYS HE FOUND IT IN THE WASHROOM BY OUR OFFICES
EXCUSE ME MISTER KENNEDY HE APOLOGIZED AS WE APPROACHED I SHOULD HAVE COME TO YOU INSTEAD OF MAKING YOU TWO WALK OVER TO ME BUT IT'S LESS SUSPICIOUS THIS WAY WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU RECOGNIZE ME MC GROARTY THE CHAUFFEUR AS FOUND THE LITTLE BOTTLE
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO HELP ME TO STAY WITH JAMESON AND MYSELF ALL DAY KENNEDY ASKED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AFTER PERHAPS A MILE OF SILENCE SURELY IT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING YOU'D ALLOW ME TO DO I HAVE NO AUTHORITY DOWN HERE THOUGH I UNDERSTAND BUT THE POLICE OR
I SAW THAT KENNEDY SINGLED OUT MARILYN GOOD MORNING SHE SAID CHEERFULLY BUT WITH EFFORT IT WAS OBVIOUS SHE HAD SPENT A NERVOUS NIGHT THERE WERE CIRCLES UNDER HER EYES ILL CONCEALED BY THE SMALL QUANTITY OF COSMETIC SHE USED HER HANDS SHIFTING CONSTANTLY
YOU KNOW EITHER THERE'S NO EFFICIENCY IN MAKING MOVING PICTURES AT ALL
A LITTLE FLING A BIT OF SARCASM WHICH ALMOST WENT OVER THE OTHER'S HEAD
KENNEDY FOUND THE LITTLE VIAL AND EXAMINED IT ATROPIN HE EJACULATED WALTER HE TURNED TO ME GET SOME PHYSOSTIGMIN QUICK HAVE MACKAY DRIVE YOU IT'S IT'S LIFE OR DEATH HERE I'LL WRITE IT DOWN PHYSOSTIGMIN
WALTER AND I FOUND A CIGARETTE CASE BELONGING TO JACK GORDON IN THE BASEMENT
HERE WALTER IT'S DRY ENOUGH NOW I WANT YOU TO RUB THE CONTENTS OF THAT TINY CAN OF GREASE OPEN BEFORE YOU THERE INTO THE CLOTH HE HURRIED OVER TO WASH HIS HANDS
BY THE TIME YOU'VE DUG UP ALL THE GOSSIP ABOUT GORDON AND SHIRLEY YOU WON'T BE SO SURE WALTER I WAS HOWEVER
KENNEDY HURRIED TO THE SIDE OF THE PHYSICIAN AND I FOLLOWED
OF COURSE THE WHOLE WAS NOT PHOTOGRAPHED IN A CONTINUOUS STRIP FROM ONE CAMERA POSITION I SAW THAT KAUF MADE SEVERAL LONG SHOTS TO CATCH THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE THEN HE MADE CLOSE UP SCENES OF ALL THE PRINCIPALS
MANTON HAS OTHER WRITERS HASN'T HE KENNEDY ASKED YES THE SCENARIO DEPARTMENT IS ON THE THIRD FLOOR ACROSS THE COURT ABOVE THE LABORATORY AND CUTTING ROOMS WHO ELSE IS IN THE BUILDING HERE THERE ARE SIX ROOMS ON THIS FLOOR WERNER REPLIED
A WHOLE TEN DAYS WORK WENT INTO THE DEVELOPER AT ONCE NEITHER OF THE CAMERA MEN CAUGHT THE FOG IN THEIR TESTS BECAUSE IT CAME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROLLS
NO ONE HAD BEEN HURT SERIOUSLY ALREADY A PROPERTY BOY WAS AT KENNEDY'S SIDE WITH A HUGE BOX MARKED PROMINENTLY WITH THE RED CROSS INSIDE WAS EVERYTHING NECESSARY AND KENNEDY STARTED TO BIND UP THE WOUNDS WITH ALL THE SKILL OF A PROFESSIONAL PHYSICIAN
THE NEGATIVE WE TOOK FROM THE CAMERAS AT TARRYTOWN HE EXPLAINED ALSO A PRINT FROM EACH ROLL READY TO RUN I'VE BEEN HOLDING THIS AS EVIDENCE MISTER KENNEDY WANTED ME TO BRING IT WITH ME TO DAY HE'S WAITING FOR US AT THE LABORATORY I REMARKED HE'LL STRAIGHTEN EVERYTHING UP IN A HURRY WON'T HE
AN OUTSIDER MIGHT ALLOW SOME OF MY PLANS TO BECOME KNOWN HE PAUSED A MOMENT IN THOUGHT
SOFTENING AS SHE CAME CLOSE TO ME LAYING A HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND ALLOWING HER SKIRT TO BRUSH MY TROUSERS TELL ME JAMIE SHE WHISPERED HER WARM BREATH THRILLING ME THROUGH AND THROUGH HAS THE WONDERFUL CRAIG KENNEDY DISCOVERED SOMETHING
IN THE VIBRANT QUIET OF THIS STUDIO CHAMBER STILL UNDER THE SHADOW OF TRAGEDY WE WITNESSED AS COLD BLOODED A BIT OF BUSINESS GENERALSHIP AS HAS EVER COME TO MY KNOWLEDGE WE OVERHEARD BECAUSE MANTON'S VOICE CARRIED ACROSS TO US IN THE STILLNESS
WITH ALL THE HORROR WRITTEN INTO THAT STORY CONTAINED NOTHING AS FEARFUL AS THE MENACE TO THE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN ITS PRODUCTION SHIRLEY'S SKIN WAS COLD AND CLAMMY HIS FACE ALMOST RIGID WHILE CONSCIOUS HE WAS HELPLESS
SHE WOULDN'T SAY ANY MORE OVER THE PHONE BUT I WAS HUGELY CURIOUS
A POINT OCCURRED TO ME YOU DON'T THINK THE POISON WAS PLANTED LATER DURING THE EXCITEMENT HARDLY OUR CRIMINAL IS TOO CLEVER TO TAKE A LONG CHANCE IN SUCH A CASE WE WOULD KNOW IT WAS SOME ONE NEAR WERNER
REVEALED SOMETHING AND SO WOULD HAVE TO BE STOLEN OR DESTROYED
IMMEDIATELY MY SUSPICIONS WERE AWAKENED I PICKED IT UP GINGERLY AT CLOSE RANGE I SAW THAT THE SPOTS WERE ONLY CHROME YELLOW MAKE UP BUT THERE WERE ALSO SPOTS OF A DIFFERENT NATURE
THEN HE HAD BECOME INSULTING AT THAT SHIRLEY KNOCKED HIM DOWN THE HEAD WAITER A WITNESS OF THE AFFAIR ORDERED GORDON PUT OUT BUT DID NOT REQUEST SHIRLEY OR STELLA TO LEAVE BECAUSE THE OTHER MAN HAD BEEN THE AGGRESSOR WITHOUT ANY QUESTION
FIRST THERE WERE CHANGES TO BE MADE IN THE SCRIPT AND FOR THOSE MILLARD TOOK HIS OWN SWEET TIME THEN WE WERE HANDED A LOT OF NEGATIVE WHICH HAD BEEN FOGGED IN THE PERFORATOR A THING THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ONCE IN A THOUSAND YEARS BUT IT CAUGHT US JUST AS WE SENT THE COMPANY DOWN TO DELAWARE WATER GAP
ALTHOUGH BEYOND THE FACT OF HER RECEIVING THEM I CAN TELL NOTHING FOR SHE SENT THE MAID HOME AT NIGHT THERE WERE NO MAID'S QUARTERS
DON'T FORGET THAT THIS WAS A COLD BLOODED CALCULATED CRIME I'M NOT ELIMINATING MANTON YET BUT UNTIL WE FIND SOME TANGIBLE EVIDENCE OF TROUBLE BETWEEN STELLA AND HIMSELF WE CAN HARDLY ASSUME HE WOULD KILL THE GIRL
MILLARD STILL SMILING TURNED TO SAY SOMETHING TO US
WE'RE FISHING IN THE DARK ABSOLUTELY SO FAR WE HAVEN'T A SINGLE BASIC FACT ON WHICH TO BUILD ANY STRUCTURE OF HYPOTHESIS WE MUST GO ON FISHING I EXPECT YOU TO DIG UP ALL THE FACTS ABOUT THESE PEOPLE
OF HANDLING THE ACTION AND HE'S OVER IN THE THICK OF IT IT'S WORSE THAN BEDLAM AND BETTER THAN A CHAPLIN COMEDY I WAS COMPELLED TO SMILE ALTHOUGH I KNEW THAT THIS WAS NOT UNCOMMON IN PICTURE STUDIOS
LIKE ANY AUTHOR IT WAS NEVER TOO LATE FOR MINOR IMPROVEMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS I DON'T DOUBT BUT THAT IF MANTON HAD PERMITTED IT MILLARD WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE APT TO INTERRUPT A SCENE IN THE TAKING IN ORDER TO ADD SOME LITTLE TOUCH OCCURRING TO HIM AS HIS ACTION SPRANG TO LIFE
