SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
APPLIED TO HER WORK BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES SUNK AGAIN WITHOUT KNOWING IT HERSELF INTO LANGUOR AND LISTLESSNESS MOVING HERSELF IN HER CHAIR FROM THE IRRITATION OF WEARINESS MUCH OFTENER THAN SHE MOVED HER NEEDLE
HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN ROMANCE I ACKNOWLEDGE AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S DIGNITY BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE
AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
HIS VANITY INDUCED HIM TO REPRESENT THE FAMILY AS YET MORE WEALTHY THAN HIS VANITY AND AVARICE HAD MADE HIM BELIEVE THEM WITH WHOMSOEVER HE WAS OR WAS LIKELY TO BE CONNECTED
HAD BEEN OPEN AND BOLD THE GENERAL ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING
THERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
WHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON THE VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED WAS ORDERED TO BATH FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION AND HIS LADY A GOOD HUMOURED WOMAN FOND OF MISS MORLAND AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IF
HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON
NORTHANGER ABBEY
HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID
HIS OWN CONSEQUENCE ALWAYS REQUIRED THAT THEIRS SHOULD BE GREAT AND AS HIS INTIMACY WITH ANY ACQUAINTANCE GREW SO REGULARLY GREW THEIR FORTUNE THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FRIEND MORLAND THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST OVERRATED
HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF
HER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL SHE HAD NO NOTION OF DRAWING NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S PROFILE THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGN
AND THANKFUL FOR MISTER THORPE'S COMMUNICATION HE ALMOST INSTANTLY DETERMINED TO SPARE NO PAINS IN WEAKENING HIS BOASTED INTEREST AND RUINING HIS DEAREST HOPES
THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION WERE ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT BEING NEGLECTED OR POOR AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN
IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES
DESIROUS OF MISTER MORLAND'S ASSISTANCE AS WELL IN GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT AS IN FINDING CONVERSATION FOR HER GUEST WHOSE EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT SHE EARNESTLY PITIED
THE TERRIFIED GENERAL PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF ALLEN WITH AN INQUIRING LOOK AND HERE TOO THORPE HAD LEARNT HIS ERROR THE ALLENS HE BELIEVED HAD LIVED NEAR THEM TOO LONG
TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
HER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE BEGGAR'S PETITION AND AFTER ALL HER NEXT SISTER SALLY COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID NOT THAT CATHERINE WAS ALWAYS STUPID BY NO MEANS
ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
AND DESIGNED HER FOR HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON DISCOVERING HIS ERROR TO TURN HER FROM THE HOUSE SEEMED THE BEST THOUGH TO HIS FEELINGS AN INADEQUATE PROOF OF HIS RESENTMENT TOWARDS HERSELF AND HIS CONTEMPT OF HER FAMILY
LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS
HAD SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS CONTINUANCE AND EXTENT OF HIS ATTENTION AND THOUGH LATTERLY FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO ATTACH HER
OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE AND AS SOON AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL KINDNESS HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED
HE STEADILY REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIS FATHER INTO HEREFORDSHIRE AN ENGAGEMENT FORMED ALMOST AT THE MOMENT TO PROMOTE THE DISMISSAL OF CATHERINE AND AS STEADILY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF OFFERING HER HIS HAND
AND HIS OWN VIEWS ON ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH HE BOASTED WITH ALMOST EQUAL OPENNESS SEEMED SUFFICIENT VOUCHERS FOR HIS TRUTH AND TO THESE WERE ADDED THE ABSOLUTE FACTS OF THE ALLENS BEING WEALTHY AND CHILDLESS
THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME I DID NOT QUITE LIKE AT BREAKFAST
MY DEAR CATHERINE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY I DO NOT KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE IF HE HAD NO FRIEND BUT YOU YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH
AND DELIGHTED IN ALL THE EXCELLENCIES OF HER CHARACTER AND TRULY LOVED HER SOCIETY I MUST CONFESS THAT HIS AFFECTION ORIGINATED IN NOTHING BETTER THAN GRATITUDE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT A PERSUASION OF HER PARTIALITY FOR HIM
THIS WAS STRANGE INDEED BUT STRANGE THINGS MAY BE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR IF THEIR CAUSE BE FAIRLY SEARCHED OUT THERE WAS NOT ONE LORD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO NOT EVEN A BARONET
THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL DISAGREEMENT HENRY IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE
HER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL PLAIN SENSE WITH A GOOD TEMPER AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORN
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED HER AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF
CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY SAYING IN A DEJECTED VOICE THAT HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH MUCH THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE OF YOU
AS HE HAD LATELY HAD PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES OF DISCOVERING AIMING AT A STYLE OF LIFE WHICH THEIR FORTUNE COULD NOT WARRANT SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES BY WEALTHY CONNECTIONS A FORWARD BRAGGING SCHEMING RACE
SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS DISMISSED THEM TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE A TETE AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO CLOSE SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION
THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOILT FOR HOME BY GREAT ACQUAINTANCE THE MIRROR I THINK I WILL LOOK IT OUT FOR YOU SOME DAY OR OTHER BECAUSE I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD CATHERINE SAID NO MORE AND WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO DO RIGHT
MISLED BY THE RHODOMONTADE OF HIS FRIEND TO BELIEVE HIS FATHER A MAN OF SUBSTANCE AND CREDIT WHEREAS THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE LAST WEEKS PROVED HIM TO BE NEITHER
CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
AND BELIEVING THAT HEART TO BE HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO GAIN NO UNWORTHY RETRACTION OF A TACIT CONSENT
NOT MERELY TO DOLLS BUT TO THE MORE HEROIC ENJOYMENTS OF INFANCY NURSING A DORMOUSE FEEDING A CANARY BIRD OR WATERING A ROSE BUSH INDEED SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR A GARDEN
THE PUBLIC ARE ENTREATED TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE IT WAS FINISHED MANY MORE SINCE IT WAS BEGUN AND THAT DURING THAT PERIOD PLACES MANNERS BOOKS AND OPINIONS HAVE UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE CHANGES
BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON AND STATING HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME IN SAFETY
I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE HOW MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER
FOR AFTER COMING EAGERLY FORWARD ON THE FIRST OVERTURE OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WITH THE MOST LIBERAL PROPOSALS HE HAD ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE POINT BY THE SHREWDNESS OF THE RELATOR
THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
DARK LANK HAIR AND STRONG FEATURES SO MUCH FOR HER PERSON AND NOT LESS UNPROPITIOUS FOR HEROISM SEEMED HER MIND SHE WAS FOND OF ALL BOY'S PLAYS AND GREATLY PREFERRED CRICKET
CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
WHERE THERE ARE HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER BUT THE MORLANDS HAD LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN AND CATHERINE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE AS PLAIN AS ANY
FRENCH BY HER MOTHER HER PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD WHAT A STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER FOR WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLD
AND ON DEVELOPING FROM AMIDST ALL HER PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY THE MEANING WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO THEM AND
CATHERINE AT ANY RATE HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT IN SUSPECTING GENERAL TILNEY OF EITHER MURDERING OR SHUTTING UP HIS WIFE SHE HAD SCARCELY SINNED AGAINST HIS CHARACTER OR MAGNIFIED HIS CRUELTY
FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN YOU SHOULD NEVER FRET ABOUT TRIFLES AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I HOPE MY CATHERINE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND AS NORTHANGER
AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES UNBROKEN SILENCE HENRY TURNING TO CATHERINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER MOTHER'S ENTRANCE ASKED HER WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY IF MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN WERE NOW AT FULLERTON
SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT
SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENT
THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GREATLY RELIEVED BY SUCH UNLOOKED FOR MILDNESS IT WAS NOT JUST AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS POWER TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE PURPOSE RETURNING IN SILENCE TO HIS SEAT THEREFORE
HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT
ON HIS RETURN FROM WOODSTON TWO DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN MET NEAR THE ABBEY BY HIS IMPATIENT FATHER HASTILY INFORMED IN ANGRY TERMS OF MISS MORLAND'S DEPARTURE AND ORDERED TO THINK OF HER NO MORE
SO AT EIGHT YEARS OLD SHE BEGAN SHE LEARNT A YEAR AND COULD NOT BEAR IT AND MISSUS MORLAND WHO DID NOT INSIST ON HER DAUGHTERS BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN SPITE OF INCAPACITY OR DISTASTE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE OFF
BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
MISSUS MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM BUT MISTER MORLAND WAS FROM HOME AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS COULD ILL BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT BUT IN SUCH A CAUSE HIS ANGER
AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME IN THE PARLOUR HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION IN HER RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS
AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY FOLLOWED
AND HE KNEW THE YOUNG MAN ON WHOM THE FULLERTON ESTATE MUST DEVOLVE THE GENERAL NEEDED NO MORE ENRAGED WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD BUT HIMSELF HE SET OUT THE NEXT DAY FOR THE ABBEY WHERE HIS PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN SEEN
HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER THAN HER NAME THORPE MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY COMMUNICATIVE
SHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGURE
NOTHING TO LAY TO HER CHARGE BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN
SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE BUT HIS FIRST PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MISTER ALLEN'S GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN
THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
UPON SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE GENERAL HAD PROCEEDED FOR NEVER HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT ITS AUTHORITY THORPE'S INTEREST IN THE FAMILY BY HIS SISTER'S APPROACHING CONNECTION WITH ONE OF ITS MEMBERS
NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR
AND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION
SHE HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERVICEABLE
AND HIS OWN SPECULATIONS HE HAD YET SOMETHING MORE IN RESERVE AND THE TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HER FATHER COULD GIVE HER WOULD BE A PRETTY ADDITION TO MISTER ALLEN'S ESTATE
HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT
HAD EVER SINCE HIS INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA BEEN GRADUALLY INCREASING AND BY MERELY ADDING TWICE AS MUCH FOR THE GRANDEUR OF THE MOMENT BY DOUBLING WHAT HE CHOSE TO THINK THE AMOUNT OF MISTER MORLAND'S PREFERMENT TREBLING HIS PRIVATE FORTUNE
THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES
SHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE
HENRY IN HAVING SUCH THINGS TO RELATE OF HIS FATHER WAS ALMOST AS PITIABLE AS IN THEIR FIRST AVOWAL TO HIMSELF HE BLUSHED FOR THE NARROW MINDED COUNSEL WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXPOSE
MISSUS MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH AND INSTANTLY PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER
WHICH IT MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK AND MISSUS MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT
WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
BESTOWING A RICH AUNT AND SINKING HALF THE CHILDREN HE WAS ABLE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE FAMILY TO THE GENERAL IN A MOST RESPECTABLE LIGHT FOR CATHERINE HOWEVER THE PECULIAR OBJECT OF THE GENERAL'S CURIOSITY
THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
THAT THEY WERE FALSE THE GENERAL HAD LEARNT FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD SUGGESTED THEM FROM THORPE HIMSELF WHOM HE HAD CHANCED TO MEET AGAIN IN TOWN AND WHO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXACTLY OPPOSITE FEELINGS
SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET
JOHN THORPE HAD FIRST MISLED HIM THE GENERAL PERCEIVING HIS SON ONE NIGHT AT THE THEATRE TO BE PAYING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO MISS MORLAND
IRRITATED BY CATHERINE'S REFUSAL AND YET MORE BY THE FAILURE OF A VERY RECENT ENDEAVOUR TO ACCOMPLISH A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN MORLAND AND ISABELLA CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOREVER
THAT THE POOR BEETLE WHICH WE TREAD UPON IN CORPORAL SUFFERANCE FEELS A PANG AS GREAT AS WHEN A GIANT DIES AND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IN LOVE ALWAYS LOOKS
BEEN CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF GIVING THE YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN A DECENT SUPPORT THEY WERE IN FACT A NECESSITOUS FAMILY NUMEROUS TOO ALMOST BEYOND EXAMPLE BY NO MEANS RESPECTED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
SHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR HER EYES GAINED MORE ANIMATION AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCE
AND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION AMONGST THE REST THAT TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR ARE TO THE JEALOUS CONFIRMATION STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT
CATHERINE HERSELF COULD NOT BE MORE IGNORANT AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS THAN HIS OWN CHILDREN HENRY AND ELEANOR PERCEIVING NOTHING IN HER SITUATION LIKELY TO ENGAGE THEIR FATHER'S PARTICULAR RESPECT
MY DEAREST PAPA YOU DO NOT THINK I COULD MEAN YOU OR SUPPOSE MISTER KNIGHTLEY TO MEAN YOU WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT WELL INFORMED USEFUL GENTLE KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY
YOU KNOW I CANNOT MISTER WESTON IS SUCH A GOOD HUMOURED PLEASANT EXCELLENT MAN THAT HE THOROUGHLY DESERVES A GOOD WIFE AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MISS TAYLOR LIVE WITH US FOR EVER AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY NOT UNWILLING TO TALK
FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS
I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM
WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAID MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS
AND THE SHADOW OF AUTHORITY BEING NOW LONG PASSED AWAY THEY HAD BEEN LIVING TOGETHER AS FRIEND AND FRIEND VERY MUTUALLY ATTACHED AND EMMA DOING JUST WHAT SHE LIKED HIGHLY ESTEEMING MISS TAYLOR'S JUDGMENT BUT DIRECTED CHIEFLY BY HER OWN
THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED THAT THEY DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RANK AS MISFORTUNES WITH HER SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED
AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT AND HAPPY WAS SHE FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE IN THE POWER
HATING CHANGE OF EVERY KIND MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING
AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS POOR MISTER AND MISS WOODHOUSE IF YOU PLEASE BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY POOR MISS TAYLOR I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA
ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY THAT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE SIR AT ANY TIME SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY LAUGHING
AND HAD LIVED NEARLY TWENTY ONE YEARS IN THE WORLD WITH VERY LITTLE TO DISTRESS OR VEX HER SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF A MOST AFFECTIONATE INDULGENT FATHER AND HAD IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SISTER'S MARRIAGE
AND YET SHE WAS A HAPPY WOMAN AND A WOMAN WHOM NO ONE NAMED WITHOUT GOOD WILL IT WAS HER OWN UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL AND CONTENTED TEMPER WHICH WORKED SUCH WONDERS SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS
WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MISTER WOODHOUSE FULL OF TRIVIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP MISSUS GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL NOT OF A SEMINARY OR AN ESTABLISHMENT OR ANY THING WHICH PROFESSED
NOT UNFREQUENTLY THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY
WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
ONLY ONE MORE PAPA ONLY FOR MISTER ELTON POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM
AS RENTING A LARGE FARM OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL VERY CREDITABLY SHE BELIEVED SHE KNEW MISTER KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF THEM BUT THEY MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED AND VERY UNFIT
OH NO MISTER WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT
THOUGH AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON
THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS
BUT I MEANT NO REFLECTION ON ANY BODY MISS TAYLOR HAS BEEN USED TO HAVE TWO PERSONS TO PLEASE SHE WILL NOW HAVE BUT ONE THE CHANCES ARE THAT SHE MUST BE A GAINER WELL SAID EMMA WILLING TO LET IT PASS
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF
IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE
SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT
BY THE BYE I HAVE NOT WISHED YOU JOY BEING PRETTY WELL AWARE OF WHAT SORT OF JOY YOU MUST BOTH BE FEELING I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST
THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT
BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND WHERE GIRLS MIGHT BE SENT TO BE OUT OF THE WAY AND SCRAMBLE THEMSELVES INTO A LITTLE EDUCATION
WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY HE WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN IN WAYS THAN IN YEARS AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER
BEEN MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSE FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD HER MOTHER HAD DIED TOO LONG AGO FOR HER TO HAVE MORE THAN AN INDISTINCT REMEMBRANCE OF HER CARESSES AND HER PLACE HAD BEEN SUPPLIED BY AN EXCELLENT WOMAN AS GOVERNESS
LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER AND IN WINTER DRESSED THEIR CHILBLAINS WITH HER OWN HANDS IT WAS NO WONDER THAT A TRAIN OF TWENTY YOUNG COUPLE NOW WALKED AFTER HER TO CHURCH SHE WAS A PLAIN MOTHERLY KIND OF WOMAN WHO HAD WORKED HARD IN HER YOUTH
AND WAS CONSIDERED WITH ALL THE REGARD AND RESPECT WHICH A HARMLESS OLD LADY UNDER SUCH UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES CAN EXCITE HER DAUGHTER ENJOYED A MOST UNCOMMON DEGREE OF POPULARITY FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED
WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY
QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE AT ANY RATE IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE SAID EMMA PLAYFULLY
WE MUST GO AND PAY WEDDING VISIT VERY SOON MY DEAR HOW AM I TO GET SO FAR RANDALLS IS SUCH A DISTANCE I COULD NOT WALK HALF SO FAR NO PAPA NOBODY THOUGHT OF YOUR WALKING WE MUST GO IN THE CARRIAGE TO BE SURE
I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA YOU CANNOT THINK THAT I SHALL LEAVE OFF MATCH MAKING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY SUCCESS SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
AND SHE HAD THEN ONLY TO SIT AND THINK OF WHAT SHE HAD LOST THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
WE TALKED IT ALL OVER WITH MISTER WESTON LAST NIGHT AND AS FOR JAMES YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WILL ALWAYS LIKE GOING TO RANDALLS BECAUSE OF HIS DAUGHTER'S BEING HOUSEMAID THERE I ONLY DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL EVER TAKE US ANYWHERE ELSE THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA
NOT AT ALL SIR IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND SO MILD THAT I MUST DRAW BACK FROM YOUR GREAT FIRE BUT YOU MUST HAVE FOUND IT VERY DAMP AND DIRTY I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD
OH NO WE ALL FELT THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ONLY HALF A MILE APART AND WERE SURE OF MEETING EVERY DAY DEAR EMMA BEARS EVERY THING SO WELL SAID HER FATHER BUT MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHE IS REALLY VERY SORRY TO LOSE POOR MISS TAYLOR
YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE WEDDING AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU FOR WE ALL BEHAVED CHARMINGLY EVERY BODY WAS PUNCTUAL EVERY BODY IN THEIR BEST LOOKS NOT A TEAR AND HARDLY A LONG FACE TO BE SEEN
AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY A NOTE WAS BROUGHT FROM MISSUS GODDARD REQUESTING IN MOST RESPECTFUL TERMS TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER A MOST WELCOME REQUEST
AND I AM SURE SHE WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD SERVANT SHE IS A CIVIL PRETTY SPOKEN GIRL I HAVE A GREAT OPINION OF HER WHENEVER I SEE HER SHE ALWAYS CURTSEYS AND ASKS ME HOW I DO IN A VERY PRETTY MANNER
EMMA NEVER THINKS OF HERSELF IF SHE CAN DO GOOD TO OTHERS REJOINED MISTER WOODHOUSE UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART
HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
MISSUS BATES THE WIDOW OF A FORMER VICAR OF HIGHBURY WAS A VERY OLD LADY ALMOST PAST EVERY THING BUT TEA AND QUADRILLE SHE LIVED WITH HER SINGLE DAUGHTER IN A VERY SMALL WAY
SUCCESS SUPPOSES ENDEAVOUR YOUR TIME HAS BEEN PROPERLY AND DELICATELY SPENT IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS MY DEAR HOW OFTEN WE SHALL BE GOING TO SEE THEM AND THEY COMING TO SEE US WE SHALL BE ALWAYS MEETING WE MUST BEGIN
TILL HER FATHER AWOKE AND MADE IT NECESSARY TO BE CHEERFUL HIS SPIRITS REQUIRED SUPPORT HE WAS A NERVOUS MAN EASILY DEPRESSED FOND OF EVERY BODY THAT HE WAS USED TO AND HATING TO PART WITH THEM
IN LONG SENTENCES OF REFINED NONSENSE TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY
THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS
THE CARRIAGE BUT JAMES WILL NOT LIKE TO PUT THE HORSES TO FOR SUCH A LITTLE WAY AND WHERE ARE THE POOR HORSES TO BE WHILE WE ARE PAYING OUR VISIT THEY ARE TO BE PUT INTO MISTER WESTON'S STABLE PAPA YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY
EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO THAT MISS TAYLOR AND I MET WITH HIM IN BROADWAY LANE WHEN BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO DRIZZLE HE DARTED AWAY WITH SO MUCH GALLANTRY AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT
SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY AND WAS NOW JUST RETURNED FROM A LONG VISIT IN THE COUNTRY TO SOME YOUNG LADIES WHO HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL THERE WITH HER SHE WAS A VERY PRETTY GIRL AND HER BEAUTY HAPPENED TO BE OF A SORT WHICH EMMA PARTICULARLY ADMIRED
SERLE UNDERSTANDS BOILING AN EGG BETTER THAN ANY BODY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU MISS BATES
AND I AM SURE SHE WILL MISS HER MORE THAN SHE THINKS FOR EMMA TURNED AWAY HER HEAD DIVIDED BETWEEN TEARS AND SMILES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION
HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN
I OBSERVE SHE ALWAYS TURNS THE LOCK OF THE DOOR THE RIGHT WAY AND NEVER BANGS IT I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT AND IT WILL BE A GREAT COMFORT TO POOR MISS TAYLOR TO HAVE SOMEBODY ABOUT HER THAT SHE IS USED TO SEE WHENEVER JAMES GOES OVER TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER YOU KNOW SHE WILL BE HEARING OF US
I THINK YOU MUST KNOW HARTFIELD ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND THAT A STRAIGHTFORWARD OPEN HEARTED MAN LIKE WESTON AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS
BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU PAPA
AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM
DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM WELL THAT IS QUITE SURPRISING FOR WE HAVE HAD A VAST DEAL OF RAIN HERE IT RAINED DREADFULLY HARD FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE WE WERE AT BREAKFAST I WANTED THEM TO PUT OFF THE WEDDING
BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND AND THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN TO FILL THE HOUSE AND GIVE HER PLEASANT SOCIETY AGAIN HIGHBURY THE LARGE AND POPULOUS VILLAGE ALMOST AMOUNTING TO A TOWN
THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD I KNOW AND WHAT YOU WOULD CERTAINLY SAY IF MY FATHER WERE NOT BY I BELIEVE IT IS VERY TRUE MY DEAR INDEED SAID MISTER WOODHOUSE WITH A SIGH I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME
AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY
WHO HAD FALLEN LITTLE SHORT OF A MOTHER IN AFFECTION SIXTEEN YEARS HAD MISS TAYLOR BEEN IN MISTER WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY LESS AS A GOVERNESS THAN A FRIEND VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA
BETWEEN THEM IT WAS MORE THE INTIMACY OF SISTERS EVEN BEFORE MISS TAYLOR HAD CEASED TO HOLD THE NOMINAL OFFICE OF GOVERNESS
AND THEREFORE CANNOT ALLOW HERSELF TO FEEL SO MUCH PAIN AS PLEASURE EVERY FRIEND OF MISS TAYLOR MUST BE GLAD TO HAVE HER SO HAPPILY MARRIED
THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS
WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL AND HELP AND RECOMMEND THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS
THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY
AND I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING INVITE HIM TO DINNER EMMA AND HELP HIM TO THE BEST OF THE FISH AND THE CHICKEN
AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER HE COULD NOT MEET HER IN CONVERSATION
RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE
HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER AFTER SOME DAYS ABSENCE
SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES
AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF I MADE THE MATCH YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO
FOR DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT AND AS TO MY POOR WORD SUCCESS WHICH YOU QUARREL WITH I DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT ANY CLAIM TO IT YOU HAVE DRAWN TWO PRETTY PICTURES
MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET
FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES I PROMISE YOU TO MAKE NONE FOR MYSELF PAPA BUT I MUST INDEED FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT IS THE GREATEST AMUSEMENT IN THE WORLD AND AFTER SUCH SUCCESS YOU KNOW
AND ANIMATED MISTER WOODHOUSE FOR SOME TIME MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
WHERE IS YOUR MERIT WHAT ARE YOU PROUD OF YOU MADE A LUCKY GUESS AND THAT IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER
HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER WITH NO PROSPECT OF A THIRD TO CHEER A LONG EVENING HER FATHER COMPOSED HIMSELF TO SLEEP AFTER DINNER AS USUAL
THE HAPPINESS OF MISS SMITH WAS QUITE EQUAL TO HER INTENTIONS MISS WOODHOUSE WAS SO GREAT A PERSONAGE IN HIGHBURY THAT THE PROSPECT OF THE INTRODUCTION HAD GIVEN AS MUCH PANIC AS PLEASURE
HOW WAS SHE TO BEAR THE CHANGE IT WAS TRUE THAT HER FRIEND WAS GOING ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM BUT EMMA WAS AWARE THAT GREAT MUST BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MISSUS WESTON ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE
SHE WAS SHORT PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE SO MUCH LESS SO TO HER FATHER THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM REALLY SUSPECT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE AS HER NOT BEING THOUGHT PERFECT BY EVERY BODY EMMA KNOWS I NEVER FLATTER HER SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE
BUT I THINK THERE MAY BE A THIRD A SOMETHING BETWEEN THE DO NOTHING AND THE DO ALL IF I HAD NOT PROMOTED MISTER WESTON'S VISITS HERE AND GIVEN MANY LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENTS AND SMOOTHED MANY LITTLE MATTERS IT MIGHT NOT HAVE COME TO ANY THING AFTER ALL
EVERY BODY SAID THAT MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN OH DEAR NO MISTER WESTON WHO HAD BEEN A WIDOWER SO LONG
WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF COMING BACK PRODIGIES MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL WAS IN HIGH REPUTE AND VERY DESERVEDLY FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD
AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN
YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER IT WAS VERY LUCKY FOR I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD POOR JAMES THINK HIMSELF SLIGHTED UPON ANY ACCOUNT
AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES HAD IT TAKEN PLACE ONLY ONCE A YEAR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRIEVANCE
WITH AN URGENCY WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
SHE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCE IN THE PLACE FOR HER FATHER WAS UNIVERSALLY CIVIL BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
LET EMMA HELP YOU TO A LITTLE BIT OF TART A VERY LITTLE BIT OURS ARE ALL APPLE TARTS YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF UNWHOLESOME PRESERVES HERE I DO NOT ADVISE THE CUSTARD MISSUS GODDARD WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS
THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF
A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
BUT IT WAS NOT IN MISTER WESTON'S NATURE TO IMAGINE THAT ANY CAPRICE COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO AFFECT ONE SO DEAR AND AS HE BELIEVED SO DESERVEDLY DEAR HE SAW HIS SON EVERY YEAR IN LONDON AND WAS PROUD OF HIM
AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MISTER WOODHOUSE FULL OF TRIVIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP MISSUS GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL
SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF
WHERE MOST OF HIS LEISURE DAYS WERE SPENT AND BETWEEN USEFUL OCCUPATION AND THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY THE NEXT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY HE HAD BY THAT TIME REALISED AN EASY COMPETENCE
I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME MY DEAREST PAPA
HAVING BROTHERS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN A GOOD WAY IN LONDON WHICH AFFORDED HIM A FAVOURABLE OPENING IT WAS A CONCERN WHICH BROUGHT JUST EMPLOYMENT ENOUGH HE HAD STILL A SMALL HOUSE IN HIGHBURY
ON COMING OF AGE IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD EVER WANT HIS FATHER'S ASSISTANCE HIS FATHER HAD NO APPREHENSION OF IT THE AUNT WAS A CAPRICIOUS WOMAN AND GOVERNED HER HUSBAND ENTIRELY
EITHER WHEN MISSUS PERRY DRANK TEA WITH MISSUS AND MISS BATES OR WHEN MISSUS AND MISS BATES RETURNED THE VISIT NOW WAS THE TIME FOR MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL TO COME AMONG THEM AND THE HOPE STRENGTHENED
IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL
THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED
BUT WHEN TEA CAME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO SAY EXACTLY AS HE HAD SAID AT DINNER POOR MISS TAYLOR I WISH SHE WERE HERE AGAIN WHAT A PITY IT IS THAT MISTER WESTON EVER THOUGHT OF HER
SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH
MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY
WELL INFORMED USEFUL GENTLE KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY INTERESTED IN ALL ITS CONCERNS AND PECULIARLY INTERESTED IN HERSELF IN EVERY PLEASURE EVERY SCHEME OF HERS
BUT NEVER ACHIEVED NOW UPON HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE IT WAS VERY GENERALLY PROPOSED AS A MOST PROPER ATTENTION
AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
THERE WAS NO RECOVERING MISS TAYLOR NOR MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF CEASING TO PITY HER BUT A FEW WEEKS BROUGHT SOME ALLEVIATION TO MISTER WOODHOUSE THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WERE OVER
BUT NEVER DID SHE GO WITHOUT MISTER WOODHOUSE'S GIVING A GENTLE SIGH AND SAYING AH POOR MISS TAYLOR SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO STAY
YOUR MAKING THE MATCH AS YOU CALL IT MEANS ONLY YOUR PLANNING IT YOUR SAYING TO YOURSELF ONE IDLE DAY I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR MISS TAYLOR IF MISTER WESTON WERE TO MARRY HER
AND MISS CHURCHILL FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM NOBODY WAS SURPRIZED EXCEPT HER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HIM AND WHO WERE FULL OF PRIDE AND IMPORTANCE WHICH THE CONNEXION WOULD OFFEND
AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY
BUT STILL THE CAKE WAS EATEN AND THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIS BENEVOLENT NERVES TILL IT WAS ALL GONE
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY
SHE WAS SHORT PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL
I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT
AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM BUT IF YOU WANT TO SHEW HIM ANY ATTENTION MY DEAR
AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY
AND IT TOOK PLACE TO THE INFINITE MORTIFICATION OF MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL
SHE DID NOT CEASE TO LOVE HER HUSBAND BUT SHE WANTED AT ONCE TO BE THE WIFE OF CAPTAIN WESTON AND MISS CHURCHILL OF ENSCOMBE CAPTAIN WESTON WHO HAD BEEN CONSIDERED
IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
MISSUS WESTON OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND MORE IN IT FOR SHE HAD A HUSBAND WHOSE WARM HEART AND SWEET TEMPER MADE HIM THINK EVERY THING DUE TO HER IN RETURN FOR THE GREAT GOODNESS OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT THOUGH SHE HAD ONE SORT OF SPIRIT
NOT UNWILLING TO TALK AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD
MISS CHURCHILL HOWEVER BEING OF AGE AND WITH THE FULL COMMAND OF HER FORTUNE THOUGH HER FORTUNE BORE NO PROPORTION TO THE FAMILY ESTATE
POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY
AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND ENGAGED IN TRADE
HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID
RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS
WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR AND ALWAYS WELCOME AND AT THIS TIME MORE WELCOME THAN USUAL AS COMING DIRECTLY FROM THEIR MUTUAL CONNEXIONS IN LONDON HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER
MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL WAS ONE OF THE BOASTS OF HIGHBURY AND A LIVELY CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM PREVAILED
AND EVERY EXPRESSION OF CONGRATULATION WHICH HER MARRIAGE HAD ALREADY SECURED SHE FELT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE WOMAN AND SHE HAD LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW FORTUNATE SHE MIGHT WELL BE THOUGHT
TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER A MOST WELCOME REQUEST FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY
WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER
WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE
AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN THE BACKGAMMON TABLE WAS PLACED BUT A VISITOR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WALKED IN AND MADE IT UNNECESSARY MISTER KNIGHTLEY A SENSIBLE MAN ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AND THIRTY
WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY BUT PARTICULARLY CONNECTED WITH IT AS THE ELDER BROTHER OF ISABELLA'S HUSBAND HE LIVED ABOUT A MILE FROM HIGHBURY
WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER
TILL THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHED HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE BOUGHT HIS HOUSE AND OBTAINED HIS WIFE AND WAS BEGINNING A NEW PERIOD OF EXISTENCE WITH EVERY PROBABILITY OF GREATER HAPPINESS THAN IN ANY YET PASSED THROUGH
FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF
AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO
HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE TO MISSUS WESTON AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET AND HER SATISFACTION HER MORE THAN SATISFACTION HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT WAS SO JUST
SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS
HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT
UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART BUT MY DEAR PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES THEY ARE SILLY THINGS AND BREAK UP ONE'S FAMILY CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY
AND WHO SEEMED SO PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITHOUT A WIFE SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL
HOW SHE HAD DEVOTED ALL HER POWERS
EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS MY DEAR
ENOUGH TO SECURE THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING HIGHBURY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS PORTIONLESS EVEN AS MISS TAYLOR
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS
AND HAD SENSE AND ENERGY AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD
AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER
AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE HARM TO YOURSELF THAN GOOD TO THEM BY INTERFERENCE
AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER FOR DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT
HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
TAYLOR WHEN THEY LEFT HER AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT OR SAW HER GO AWAY IN THE EVENING ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER OWN
AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE
WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA
BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS TILL HER FATHER AWOKE
AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
SHE HAD NOT THE BEST SHE HAD RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO PURSUE HER OWN WILL IN SPITE OF HER BROTHER BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REFRAIN FROM UNREASONABLE REGRETS AT THAT BROTHER'S UNREASONABLE ANGER
THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON
AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE THAT I MADE THE MATCH MYSELF I MADE THE MATCH YOU KNOW FOUR YEARS AGO AND TO HAVE IT TAKE PLACE AND BE PROVED IN THE RIGHT
AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM
THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER
BUT DEAR EMMA WAS OF NO FEEBLE CHARACTER
FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY
THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER
MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT OH NO MISTER WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED
AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER THOUGH COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE REMOVED BY MATRIMONY
I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM
ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY
AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
MISSUS WESTON HAD OF COURSE FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE YOUNG MAN AND SUCH A PLEASING ATTENTION WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF HIS GREAT GOOD SENSE
ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT
IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN AND HOW IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION
AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE
MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
AND SO APPARENT THAT EMMA WELL AS SHE KNEW HER FATHER WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN BY SURPRIZE
THROUGH AT HARTFIELD BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL HAS WRITTEN TO MISSUS WESTON
AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS
POOR MISTER AND MISS WOODHOUSE IF YOU PLEASE BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY POOR MISS TAYLOR I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF DEPENDENCE OR INDEPENDENCE AT ANY RATE
MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING NOR COULD EVER SPEAK OF HER BUT WITH COMPASSION THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION
THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY SHE RECALLED HER PAST KINDNESS THE KINDNESS THE AFFECTION OF SIXTEEN YEARS HOW SHE HAD TAUGHT AND HOW SHE HAD PLAYED WITH HER FROM FIVE YEARS OLD
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE
AND SOCIAL TEMPER BY ENTERING INTO THE MILITIA OF HIS COUNTY THEN EMBODIED CAPTAIN WESTON WAS A GENERAL FAVOURITE AND WHEN THE CHANCES OF HIS MILITARY LIFE HAD INTRODUCED HIM TO MISS CHURCHILL OF A GREAT YORKSHIRE FAMILY
FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER
AND TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF HIS OWN FRIENDLY AND SOCIAL DISPOSITION IT WAS NOW SOME TIME SINCE MISS TAYLOR HAD BEGUN TO INFLUENCE HIS SCHEMES BUT AS IT WAS NOT THE TYRANNIC INFLUENCE OF YOUTH ON YOUTH
HE HAD NEVER BEEN AN UNHAPPY MAN HIS OWN TEMPER HAD SECURED HIM FROM THAT EVEN IN HIS FIRST MARRIAGE BUT HIS SECOND MUST SHEW HIM HOW DELIGHTFUL A WELL JUDGING AND TRULY AMIABLE WOMAN COULD BE
BUT ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE CHEERFUL MIND
NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME
THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN
SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER
I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM
BEING SETTLED IN LONDON ONLY SIXTEEN MILES OFF WAS MUCH BEYOND HER DAILY REACH
HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING
AND EMBRACING HIS WIFE AFTER A SHORT TIME THE COUNT SAW BERTUCCIO WHO UNTIL THEN HAD BEEN OCCUPIED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE GLIDE INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM HE WENT TO HIM
GLANCING AT THE SUN DIAL THE TEN MINUTES ARE ALMOST UP I MUST RETURN TO MY POST WILL YOU GO UP WITH ME I FOLLOW YOU MONTE CRISTO ENTERED THE TOWER WHICH WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE STORIES
BUT OF TEN THREE ONLY REMAINED THE REST HAVING BEEN BROKEN BY THE WAVES I AM FOND OF THESE JARS UPON WHICH PERHAPS MISSHAPEN FRIGHTFUL MONSTERS HAVE FIXED THEIR COLD DULL EYES
LISTEN FRIEND SAID MONTE CRISTO I DO NOT WISH TO CAUSE YOU ANY REMORSE BELIEVE ME THEN WHEN I SWEAR TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE WRONGED NO MAN BUT ON THE CONTRARY HAVE BENEFITED MANKIND
BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI THAT TENDER FATHER WITH WHOM WE ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED CLOSE TO HIM DRESSED IN ENTIRELY NEW CLOTHES ADVANCED SMILINGLY COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI THE DUTIFUL SON
HE SAID WILL YOUR EXCELLENCY DEIGN TO OPEN IT SAID THE DELIGHTED BERTUCCIO AND YOU WILL FIND GLOVES IN IT ELSEWHERE THE COUNT FOUND EVERYTHING HE REQUIRED SMELLING BOTTLES CIGARS KNICK KNACKS GOOD HE SAID
DORMICE ARE BAD NEIGHBORS FOR US WHO DO NOT EAT THEM PRESERVED AS THE ROMANS DID WHAT DID THE ROMANS EAT THEM SAID THE GARDENER ATE DORMICE
GLIDING DOWN THE STAIRS RESTORED BUT THE PREVIOUS DAY AS IF THEY HAD ALWAYS INHABITED THE HOUSE OTHERS FILLING THE COACH HOUSES WHERE THE EQUIPAGES ENCASED AND NUMBERED APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN INSTALLED FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
AT A BIRTHDAY FEAST THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF TELLING STRANGE THINGS IF IN ADDITION TO THE MENACING EARS WHICH THE PROVERB SAYS ALL WALLS ARE PROVIDED WITH IT HAD ALSO A VOICE
THE GARDEN WAS CROSSED BY A PATH OF RED GRAVEL EDGED BY A BORDER OF THICK BOX OF MANY YEARS GROWTH AND OF A TONE AND COLOR THAT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED THE HEART OF DELACROIX OUR MODERN RUBENS
STAY LOOK AT
STAY SAID DEBRAY I RECOGNIZE THIS HOBBEMA AH INDEED YES IT WAS PROPOSED FOR THE MUSEUM WHICH I BELIEVE DOES NOT CONTAIN ONE SAID MONTE CRISTO
AND IN WHICH MYRIADS OF SMALL FISH HAVE SLEPT SEEKING A REFUGE FROM THE PURSUIT OF THEIR ENEMIES MEANWHILE DANGLARS WHO HAD
DO YOU REGRET THEM ASKED MORREL WITH HIS OPEN LAUGH I CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED THE COUNT NO I SHOULD ONLY REGRET IF THE HORSE HAD NOT PROVED GOOD IT IS SO GOOD
AND I OUGHT NOT TO WASTE IT BUT HAVING RECEIVED THE SIGNAL THAT I MIGHT REST FOR AN HOUR HERE HE GLANCED AT THE SUN DIAL FOR THERE WAS EVERYTHING IN THE ENCLOSURE OF MONTLHERY EVEN A SUN DIAL
UPON WHICH GREEN FRUIT HAD SUCCEEDED TO RED AND WHITE FLOWERS MONTE CRISTO LOOKED FOR THE ENTRANCE TO THE ENCLOSURE AND WAS NOT LONG IN FINDING A LITTLE WOODEN GATE WORKING ON WILLOW HINGES
AND FASTENED WITH A NAIL AND STRING THE COUNT SOON MASTERED THE MECHANISM THE GATE OPENED AND HE THEN FOUND HIMSELF IN A LITTLE GARDEN ABOUT TWENTY FEET LONG BY TWELVE WIDE BOUNDED ON ONE SIDE BY PART OF THE HEDGE
AND ORDERED HIM TO SELL AT ANY PRICE WHEN IT WAS SEEN THAT DANGLARS SOLD THE SPANISH FUNDS FELL DIRECTLY DANGLARS LOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS BUT HE RID HIMSELF OF ALL HIS SPANISH SHARES
I SHOULD ASK YOU IF YOU WOULD SELL YOUR HORSE MORREL SMILED WITH AN EXPRESSION VERY LIKE A GRIMACE AND THEN TURNED ROUND TO MONTE CRISTO
MAKE FIFTEEN YOU ARE FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD HOW LONG MUST YOU HAVE SERVED TO CLAIM THE PENSION OH SIR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND HOW MUCH IS THE PENSION A HUNDRED CROWNS
THOUSAND FRANCS SIR IT IS NOTHING NO BUT THEN WE ARE LODGED AS YOU PERCEIVE MONTE CRISTO LOOKED AT THE ROOM THEY PASSED TO THE THIRD STORY IT WAS THE TELEGRAPH ROOM
WITH CORAL AND ENCRUSTED THEM WITH SHELLS THE WHOLE WAS CEMENTED BY TWO HUNDRED YEARS BENEATH THESE ALMOST IMPERVIOUS DEPTHS FOR A REVOLUTION CARRIED AWAY THE EMPEROR WHO WISHED TO MAKE THE TRIAL
AT FIRST MY NECK WAS CRAMPED WITH LOOKING AT IT BUT AT THE END OF A YEAR I BECAME USED TO IT
THE MAN EXECUTED ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE THREE SIGNS GIVEN BY THE COUNT IN SPITE OF THE FRIGHTFUL CONTORTIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT WHO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE CHANGE BEGAN TO THINK THE GARDENER HAD GONE MAD
MARVELLOUS ALIKE TO SIGHT AND SMELL WAS A BILLIARD TABLE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN ABANDONED DURING THE PAST HOUR BY PLAYERS WHO HAD LEFT THE BALLS ON THE CLOTH ONE CHAMBER ALONE HAD BEEN RESPECTED BY THE MAGNIFICENT BERTUCCIO
OH OH HE AT LENGTH MUTTERED DO YOU SEE WHAT WHO HIM HIM
THERE WAS NOT A BLADE OF GRASS TO BE SEEN IN THE PATHS
THOUGH THEY DO SAY AS FAT AS A DORMOUSE IT IS NOT A WONDER THEY ARE FAT SLEEPING ALL DAY AND ONLY WAKING TO EAT ALL NIGHT LISTEN LAST YEAR I HAD FOUR APRICOTS THEY STOLE ONE
AND HAVING TEN MINUTES BEFORE ME AND MY STRAWBERRIES BEING RIPE WHEN A DAY LONGER BY THE BY SIR DO YOU THINK DORMICE EAT THEM INDEED I SHOULD THINK NOT REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
WAS SCENTED WITH ITS MASTER'S FAVORITE PERFUMES AND HAD THE VERY LIGHT REGULATED ACCORDING TO HIS WISH WHEN THE COUNT ARRIVED HE HAD UNDER HIS TOUCH HIS BOOKS AND ARMS HIS EYES RESTED UPON HIS FAVORITE PICTURES
AS PALE AS THOUGH HE HAD ISSUED FROM HIS TOMB INSTEAD OF HIS CARRIAGE MADAME DANGLARS THREW A RAPID AND INQUIRING GLANCE WHICH COULD ONLY BE INTERPRETED BY MONTE CRISTO AROUND THE COURT YARD OVER THE PERISTYLE
WILL YOU CONDUCT THE BARONESS DANGLARS
AND WON THE HEART OF THE GARDENER DID YOU COME HERE SIR TO SEE THE TELEGRAPH HE SAID YES IF IT ISN'T CONTRARY TO THE RULES OH NO SAID THE GARDENER NOT IN THE LEAST
I HAVE TEN LEFT SAID THE MAN FOR HERE ARE ELEVEN AND I HAD TWENTY ONE FIVE MORE THAN LAST YEAR BUT I AM NOT SURPRISED THE SPRING HAS BEEN WARM THIS YEAR AND STRAWBERRIES REQUIRE HEAT SIR
THE MAN LOOKED AT THE BANK NOTES FELT THEM COUNTED THEM TURNED PALE THEN RED THEN RUSHED INTO HIS ROOM TO DRINK A GLASS OF WATER BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO REACH THE WATER JUG AND FAINTED IN THE MIDST OF HIS DRIED HERBS
A HUNDRED CROWNS YES SIR SO YOU SEE THAT I AM NOT LIKELY TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS NOT EVEN FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WAGES COME IT IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT FOR FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
SEVEN MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI EIGHT EIGHT REPEATED BERTUCCIO STOP YOU ARE IN A SHOCKING HURRY TO BE OFF YOU FORGET ONE OF MY GUESTS LEAN A LITTLE TO THE LEFT
FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE NEW TELEGRAM REACHED THE MINISTER DEBRAY
MONTE CRISTO HAD SEEN ENOUGH EVERY MAN HAS A DEVOURING PASSION IN HIS HEART AS EVERY FRUIT HAS ITS WORM THAT OF THE TELEGRAPH MAN WAS HORTICULTURE HE BEGAN GATHERING THE GRAPE LEAVES WHICH SCREENED THE SUN FROM THE GRAPES
YOU WILL LOSE IT FOR YOU ARE GOING TO ALTER YOUR CORRESPONDENT'S MESSAGE OH SIR WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING A JEST SIR UNLESS YOU FORCE ME
TAKE THESE AND THE COUNT PLACED THE PACKET IN THE MAN'S HANDS NOW THIS IS NOT ALL HE SAID YOU CANNOT LIVE UPON YOUR FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS I SHALL STILL HAVE MY PLACE NO
THIS IS THE REASON THAT INSTEAD OF THE SIXTEEN I HAD LAST YEAR I HAVE THIS YEAR YOU SEE ELEVEN ALREADY PLUCKED TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AH I MISS THREE
LIVED SANG AND BLOOMED LIKE THE HOUSES WE HAVE LONG CHERISHED AND IN WHICH WHEN WE ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THEM WE LEAVE A PART OF OUR SOULS THE SERVANTS PASSED GAYLY ALONG THE FINE COURT YARD SOME BELONGING TO THE KITCHENS
AND ACROSS THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE THEN REPRESSING A SLIGHT EMOTION WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SEEN ON HER COUNTENANCE IF SHE HAD NOT KEPT HER COLOR SHE ASCENDED THE STEPS SAYING TO MORREL SIR
AND FASTENED THE STRING TO THE NAIL AND CAST A LOOK AROUND THE MAN AT THE TELEGRAPH SAID HE MUST EITHER ENGAGE A GARDENER OR DEVOTE HIMSELF PASSIONATELY TO AGRICULTURE
AND THE SHAPE AND EXTENT OF THE LAWN WHICH WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE PAVING STONES THUS THE HOUSE HAD BECOME UNRECOGNIZABLE AND BERTUCCIO HIMSELF DECLARED THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW IT ENCIRCLED AS IT WAS BY A FRAMEWORK OF TREES
WAS THAT THIS HOUSE WHICH APPEARED ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE SO SAD AND GLOOMY IMPREGNATED WITH THAT SICKLY SMELL ONE CAN ALMOST FANCY TO BE THE SMELL OF TIME HAD IN A SINGLE DAY ACQUIRED THE ASPECT OF LIFE
CAVALCANTI SAID DEBRAY A FINE NAME SAID MORREL YES SAID CHATEAU RENAUD THESE ITALIANS ARE WELL NAMED AND BADLY DRESSED YOU ARE FASTIDIOUS CHATEAU RENAUD REPLIED DEBRAY
SAID THE COUNT SEVERELY I ORDERED DINNER AT THAT HOUR AND I DO NOT LIKE TO WAIT AND HE RETURNED TO HIS GUESTS WHILE BERTUCCIO LEANING AGAINST THE WALL SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE DINING ROOM
AND AT THE SAME MINUTE A CARRIAGE WITH SMOKING HORSES ACCOMPANIED BY TWO MOUNTED GENTLEMEN ARRIVED AT THE GATE WHICH OPENED BEFORE THEM THE CARRIAGE DROVE ROUND AND STOPPED AT THE STEPS FOLLOWED BY THE HORSEMEN
SAID MORREL BESTOWING A GRATEFUL SMILE ON MONTE CRISTO IT SEEMS TO ME SAID DANGLARS IN HIS COARSE TONE ILL CONCEALED BY A FORCED SMILE THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY GOT HORSES ENOUGH
HOW A GARDENER MAY GET RID OF THE DORMICE THAT EAT HIS PEACHES NOT ON THE SAME NIGHT AS HE HAD INTENDED BUT THE NEXT MORNING THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO WENT OUT BY THE BARRIER D'ENFER
GRAY MOUSTACHES A BOLD EYE A MAJOR'S UNIFORM ORNAMENTED WITH THREE MEDALS AND FIVE CROSSES IN FACT THE THOROUGH BEARING OF AN OLD SOLDIER SUCH WAS THE APPEARANCE OF MAJOR
YOU ARE FOND OF GARDENING PASSIONATELY AND YOU WOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE INSTEAD OF THIS TERRACE OF TWENTY FEET AN ENCLOSURE OF TWO ACRES SIR I SHOULD MAKE A TERRESTRIAL PARADISE OF IT
NOTWITHSTANDING HIS SELF CONTROL WAS VISIBLY AFFECTED AND WHEN MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED HIS HAND HE FELT IT TREMBLE CERTAINLY WOMEN ALONE KNOW HOW TO DISSIMULATE SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIMSELF GLANCING AT MADAME DANGLARS
AT THE END OF TWO HUNDRED YEARS THE DOCUMENTS WERE FOUND AND THEY THOUGHT OF BRINGING UP THE JARS DIVERS DESCENDED IN MACHINES MADE EXPRESSLY ON THE DISCOVERY INTO THE BAY WHERE THEY WERE THROWN
PRICKED HIM DREADFULLY HE SHUDDERED AND RUBBED HIS EYES AS THOUGH AWAKING FROM A DREAM SIR SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIM I DO NOT RECOMMEND MY PICTURES TO YOU WHO POSSESS SUCH SPLENDID PAINTINGS BUT NEVERTHELESS
IN A THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR A GARDEN WITH TWO ACRES OF LAND AND A THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR OH HEAVENS COME TAKE THEM AND MONTE CRISTO FORCED THE BANK NOTES INTO HIS HAND WHAT AM I TO DO
YOU LIVE BADLY ON YOUR THOUSAND FRANCS BADLY ENOUGH BUT YET I DO LIVE YES BUT YOU HAVE A WRETCHEDLY SMALL GARDEN TRUE THE GARDEN IS NOT LARGE
BUT A TRAVELLER BROUGHT HERE BY A CURIOSITY HE HALF REPENTS OF SINCE HE CAUSES YOU TO LOSE YOUR TIME AH MY TIME IS NOT VALUABLE REPLIED THE MAN WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE
I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO THEM BUT THEY APPEAR TO SPEAK FRENCH WITH A VERY PURE ACCENT SAID DANGLARS THE SON HAS BEEN EDUCATED IN A COLLEGE IN THE SOUTH I BELIEVE NEAR MARSEILLES YOU WILL FIND HIM QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC
UNTIL HE ENTERED HIS BEDROOM SITUATED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO THE CLOSED ROOM THEN HE APPROACHED A LITTLE PIECE OF FURNITURE MADE OF ROSEWOOD WHICH HE HAD NOTICED AT A PREVIOUS VISIT THAT CAN ONLY BE TO HOLD GLOVES
STEALING IN A GARDEN HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE THAT MAY LEAD HIM TO CERTAINLY IT IS WRONG SAID MONTE CRISTO BUT YOU SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE YOUTH AND GREEDINESS OF THE DELINQUENT OF COURSE SAID THE GARDENER
AND HE GLANCED TIMIDLY AT THE COUNT'S BLUE COAT CALM YOURSELF MY FRIEND SAID THE COUNT WITH THE SMILE WHICH HE MADE AT WILL EITHER TERRIBLE OR BENEVOLENT AND WHICH NOW EXPRESSED ONLY THE KINDLIEST FEELING I AM NOT AN INSPECTOR
NOTHING VERY DIFFICULT BUT WHAT IS IT TO REPEAT THESE SIGNS MONTE CRISTO TOOK A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET UPON WHICH WERE DRAWN THREE SIGNS WITH NUMBERS TO INDICATE THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE TO BE WORKED
FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE DOORS OF THE DRAWING ROOM WERE THROWN OPEN AND BERTUCCIO APPEARING SAID WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT
I SHOULD NOT SEE HIM THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN I COULD NOT REPEAT THE SIGNALS AND THEN NOT HAVING REPEATED THEM THROUGH NEGLIGENCE I SHOULD BE FINED HOW MUCH
YES SIR YOU ALARM ME NONSENSE SIR
PRESERVING THE SEEDS HE HAD LABELLED THEM WITH AS MUCH CARE AS IF HE HAD BEEN MASTER BOTANIST
NO AND YET THEY REFUSED TO BUY IT WHY SAID CHATEAU RENAUD YOU PRETEND NOT TO KNOW
GAVE NO INDICATIONS OF SPLENDOR NOTHING ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM THE DESTINED RESIDENCE OF THE MAGNIFICENT COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO BUT THIS SIMPLICITY WAS ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF ITS MASTER
WELL SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO ALTER A SIGNAL AND SUBSTITUTE ANOTHER AH THAT IS ANOTHER CASE I SHOULD BE TURNED OFF AND LOSE MY PENSION THREE HUNDRED FRANCS
AT THE SAME TIME TELLS MY RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT THAT I AM READY WHILE IT GIVES NOTICE TO MY LEFT HAND CORRESPONDENT TO PREPARE IN HIS TURN IT IS VERY INGENIOUS SAID THE COUNT
JUST SO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS DO YOU UNDERSTAND SIR LET ME SEE MY RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT ON THE CONTRARY DO NOT LOOK AT HIM BUT AT THIS WHAT IS IT WHAT
A RAPHAEL A VANDYKE A ZURBARAN
NOTHING MORE IS REQUIRED OF ME IS IT POSSIBLE SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIMSELF THAT I CAN HAVE MET WITH A MAN THAT HAS NO AMBITION THAT WOULD SPOIL MY PLANS SIR SAID THE GARDENER
AND THEN SUCH AS IT IS IT IS FILLED WITH DORMICE WHO EAT EVERYTHING AH THEY ARE MY SCOURGES TELL ME SHOULD YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE TO TURN YOUR HEAD
LEFT ENRAPTURED SO GREAT SO POWERFUL AND REAL WAS THE INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY THIS MAN OVER ALL WHO SURROUNDED HIM AT PRECISELY SIX O'CLOCK THE CLATTER OF HORSES HOOFS WAS HEARD AT THE ENTRANCE DOOR
THIS PATH WAS FORMED IN THE SHAPE OF THE FIGURE OF EIGHT THUS IN ITS WINDINGS MAKING A WALK OF SIXTY FEET IN A GARDEN OF ONLY TWENTY NEVER HAD FLORA THE FRESH AND SMILING GODDESS OF GARDENERS
WHAT DID YOU SAY SIR ASKED THE MAN I WAS SAYING IT WAS VERY INTERESTING WHAT WAS ALL YOU WERE SHOWING ME AND YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND NONE OF THESE SIGNALS NONE AT ALL
THAT IS TRUE SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I LIKE BEST SAID THE MAN SMILING WHY DO YOU LIKE THAT BEST BECAUSE THEN I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY I AM A MACHINE THEN AND NOTHING ELSE AND SO LONG AS I WORK
WITH HIS EYES STARTING AND HIS HAIR ON END WAITING FOR WHOM BERTUCCIO WITHOUT ANSWERING
THE TOWER CONTAINED IMPLEMENTS SUCH AS SPADES RAKES WATERING POTS HUNG AGAINST THE WALL THIS WAS ALL THE FURNITURE THE SECOND WAS THE MAN'S CONVENTIONAL ABODE OR RATHER SLEEPING PLACE
TAKING THE ROAD TO ORLEANS LEAVING THE VILLAGE OF LINAS WITHOUT STOPPING AT THE TELEGRAPH WHICH FLOURISHED ITS GREAT BONY ARMS AS HE PASSED THE COUNT REACHED THE TOWER OF MONTLHERY
WHICH HE WAS PLACING UPON GRAPE LEAVES HE HAD TWELVE LEAVES AND ABOUT AS MANY STRAWBERRIES WHICH ON RISING SUDDENLY HE LET FALL FROM HIS HAND YOU ARE GATHERING YOUR CROP SIR SAID MONTE CRISTO SMILING
THE OTHER TEN WERE SUNK THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS DEEP INTO THE SEA THE SEA KNOWING WHAT WAS REQUIRED OF HER THREW OVER THEM HER WEEDS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE TO MATCH WITH THE LIBRARY WAS THE CONSERVATORY ORNAMENTED WITH RARE FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN CHINA JARS AND IN THE MIDST OF THE GREENHOUSE
THE OVERSEER WOULD NOT HAVE OBJECTED WHILE HE WAS ABOUT IT TO HAVE MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN BUT THE COUNT HAD POSITIVELY FORBIDDEN IT TO BE TOUCHED BERTUCCIO MADE AMENDS HOWEVER
IT WAS OUR CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS WHO HAD ARRIVED ON MEDEAH I AM SURE I AM THE FIRST CRIED MORREL I DID IT ON PURPOSE TO HAVE YOU A MINUTE TO MYSELF BEFORE EVERY ONE CAME JULIE AND EMMANUEL
AND THE PENINSULA IS IN THE ENJOYMENT OF PROFOUND PEACE A TELEGRAPHIC SIGNAL IMPROPERLY INTERPRETED
A PAUL POTTER
MONTE CRISTO LOOKED IN TURN AT THE TWO IRON HANDLES BY WHICH THE MACHINE WAS WORKED IT IS VERY INTERESTING HE SAID BUT IT MUST BE VERY TEDIOUS FOR A LIFETIME YES
BUT THAT MORNING LAID DOWN AND UPON WHICH THE WATER WAS YET GLISTENING FOR THE REST THE ORDERS HAD BEEN ISSUED BY THE COUNT HE HIMSELF HAD GIVEN A PLAN TO BERTUCCIO MARKING THE SPOT WHERE EACH TREE WAS TO BE PLANTED
CAVALCANTI THAT TELLS ME THEIR NAME AND NOTHING ELSE AH TRUE YOU DO NOT KNOW THE ITALIAN NOBILITY THE CAVALCANTI ARE ALL DESCENDED FROM PRINCES HAVE THEY ANY FORTUNE
BUT PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE WAS AFRAID AND A BRAVE CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS CANNOT RISK THIS EVEN TO GRATIFY A PRETTY WOMAN WHICH IS IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE MOST SACRED OBLIGATIONS IN THE WORLD YOU SEE MY POSITION MADAME
AND OUR HOLIDAYS HOLIDAYS YES WHEN WHEN WE HAVE A FOG
I THINK I CAN EFFECTUALLY FORCE YOU AND MONTE CRISTO DREW ANOTHER PACKET FROM HIS POCKET HERE ARE TEN THOUSAND MORE FRANCS HE SAID WITH THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND ALREADY IN YOUR POCKET THEY WILL MAKE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
NOTHING ESCAPED THE COUNT'S NOTICE AND HE OBSERVED A LITTLE NOTE PASSED WITH THE FACILITY THAT INDICATES FREQUENT PRACTICE FROM THE HAND OF MADAME DANGLARS TO THAT OF THE MINISTER'S SECRETARY AFTER HIS WIFE THE BANKER DESCENDED
EXCUSE ME SIR REPLIED THE MAN RAISING HIS HAND TO HIS CAP I AM NOT UP THERE I KNOW BUT I HAVE ONLY JUST COME DOWN DO NOT LET ME INTERFERE WITH YOU IN ANYTHING MY FRIEND SAID THE COUNT GATHER YOUR STRAWBERRIES IF INDEED
OR RATHER THERE IS NO TRUTH IN ANYTHING YOU HAVE TOLD ME IT WAS A FRIGHT OF THE IMAGINATION A DREAM OF YOUR FANCY YOU WENT TO SLEEP FULL OF THOUGHTS OF VENGEANCE THEY WEIGHED HEAVILY UPON YOUR STOMACH YOU HAD THE NIGHTMARE
WITH FIVE THOUSAND YOU CAN BUY A PRETTY LITTLE HOUSE WITH TWO ACRES OF LAND
A HUNDRED FRANCS THE TENTH OF YOUR INCOME THAT WOULD BE FINE WORK AH SAID THE MAN HAS IT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU SAID MONTE CRISTO ONCE SIR WHEN I WAS GRAFTING A ROSE TREE
DO YOU NOT KNOW THESE BITS OF PAPER BANK NOTES EXACTLY THERE ARE FIFTEEN OF THEM AND WHOSE ARE THEY YOURS IF YOU LIKE MINE EXCLAIMED THE MAN
THE COUNT WATCHED HIM GOOD HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED WHAT IS THE MATTER SAID THE COUNT THAT WOMAN THAT WOMAN WHICH THE ONE WITH A WHITE DRESS AND SO MANY DIAMONDS THE FAIR ONE MADAME DANGLARS
BY LOADING THE ANTE CHAMBERS STAIRCASES AND MANTLE PIECES WITH FLOWERS WHAT ABOVE ALL MANIFESTED THE SHREWDNESS OF THE STEWARD AND THE PROFOUND SCIENCE OF THE MASTER THE ONE IN CARRYING OUT THE IDEAS OF THE OTHER
BY THE OLD TOWER COVERED WITH IVY AND STUDDED WITH WALL FLOWERS NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IN LOOKING AT THIS OLD WEATHER BEATEN FLORAL DECKED TOWER WHICH MIGHT BE LIKENED TO AN ELDERLY DAME DRESSED UP TO RECEIVE HER GRANDCHILDREN
AS TO THE LEFT HAND ONE HE CONSCIENTIOUSLY REPEATED THE SAME SIGNALS WHICH WERE FINALLY TRANSMITTED TO THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR NOW YOU ARE RICH SAID MONTE CRISTO YES REPLIED THE MAN
I THINK SO INDEED HE HAS SIX MILLIONS WORTH HE MUST SELL THEM AT WHATEVER PRICE WHY
NOT ONE BORE THE MARK OF THE SLUG NOR WERE THERE EVIDENCES ANYWHERE OF THE CLUSTERING APHIS WHICH IS SO DESTRUCTIVE TO PLANTS GROWING IN A DAMP SOIL AND YET IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THE DAMP HAD BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE GARDEN THE EARTH
SUCH A QUESTION IT IS THE WORK OF ANOTHER AGE CONSTRUCTED BY THE GENII OF EARTH AND WATER HOW SO AT WHAT PERIOD CAN THAT HAVE BEEN I DO NOT KNOW
ARE THEY GOING TO PUT HIM IN THE MINISTRY NOT YET I THINK MORE LIKELY HE HAS BEEN SPECULATING ON THE BOURSE AND HAS LOST MONEY
WHOM WE ALSO KNOW THE THREE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TALKING TOGETHER ON THE ENTRANCE OF THE NEW COMERS THEIR EYES GLANCED FROM FATHER TO SON AND THEN NATURALLY ENOUGH RESTED ON THE LATTER WHOM THEY BEGAN CRITICISING
COME CALM YOURSELF AND RECKON THEM UP
IF YOU HAD SEEN AT WHAT A PACE HE CAME LIKE THE WIND I SHOULD THINK SO A HORSE THAT COST FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS SAID MONTE CRISTO IN THE TONE WHICH A FATHER WOULD USE TOWARDS A SON
BLACK AS SOOT THE THICK FOLIAGE OF THE TREES BETRAYED ITS PRESENCE BESIDES HAD NATURAL HUMIDITY BEEN WANTING IT COULD HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATELY SUPPLIED BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS THANKS TO A TANK OF WATER
AT THE ARIZONA CAVE IT WAS DARK WHEN I OPENED MY EYES AGAIN STRANGE STIFF GARMENTS WERE UPON MY BODY
MY FATHER AND I OWNING AND OPERATING A STRING OF GENERAL STORES THROUGHOUT VIRGINIA AT THAT TIME CAPTAIN CARTER HAD A SMALL BUT BEAUTIFUL COTTAGE SITUATED ON A BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE RIVER AND DURING ONE OF MY LAST VISITS IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE
I WAS EVER A GOOD HAND WITH ANIMALS AND BY INCLINATION AS WELL AS BECAUSE IT BROUGHT MORE LASTING AND SATISFACTORY RESULTS I WAS ALWAYS KIND AND HUMANE IN MY DEALINGS WITH THE LOWER ORDERS
AND WEST I TURNED BACK IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION
THE CONCUSSION NEARLY CAPSIZED HER AND WITH A SICKENING PLUNGE SHE HURTLED DOWNWARD THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT
HE SPENT AT MY FATHER'S HOME IN VIRGINIA JUST PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE CIVIL WAR I WAS THEN A CHILD OF BUT FIVE YEARS
HIS FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS RELATED TO THIS MANUSCRIPT WHICH I WAS TO RETAIN SEALED AND UNREAD JUST AS I FOUND IT FOR ELEVEN YEARS NOR WAS I TO DIVULGE ITS CONTENTS UNTIL TWENTY ONE YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH
AND THAT I SMILED IT WAS ALL GREEK TO ME BUT THE MORE I BEGGED HER TO EXPLAIN THE MORE POSITIVE BECAME HER DENIALS OF MY REQUEST AND SO IN VERY HOPELESSNESS I DESISTED
EVEN IN SECRECY IF NECESSARY HIS PROPERTY WAS LEFT IN SUCH A WAY THAT I WAS TO RECEIVE THE ENTIRE INCOME FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHEN THE PRINCIPAL WAS TO BECOME MINE
NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROUD CLAIM OF THE THARKS TO ABSOLUTE VERITY DEJAH THORIS LAUGHED I KNEW THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU BECAME A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY YOU WOULD NOT CEASE TO BE MY FRIEND A WARRIOR MAY CHANGE HIS METAL BUT NOT HIS HEART AS THE SAYING IS UPON BARSOOM
AND LATER BY A SWIFT CRUISER CARRYING A HUNDRED MEN AND A BATTERY OF RAPID FIRE GUNS
BEFORE ME WAS A SMALL PATCH OF MOONLIT SKY WHICH SHOWED THROUGH A RAGGED APERTURE AS MY HANDS PASSED OVER MY BODY THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH POCKETS AND IN ONE OF THESE A SMALL PARCEL OF MATCHES WRAPPED IN OILED PAPER
THE WATCHMAN RELATED THE FEW DETAILS CONNECTED WITH THE FINDING OF THE BODY
AND THEN I FOUND TO MY CONSTERNATION THAT A FRAGMENT OF THE PROJECTILE HAD UTTERLY DESTROYED MY ONLY GUIDE AS WELL AS MY SPEEDOMETER IT WAS TRUE I COULD FOLLOW THE STARS IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF HELIUM BUT WITHOUT KNOWING THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE CITY
BUT THE TRUTH SLOWLY FORCED ITSELF UPON ME I WAS LOOKING UPON ARIZONA FROM THE SAME LEDGE FROM WHICH TEN YEARS BEFORE I HAD GAZED WITH LONGING UPON MARS BURYING MY HEAD IN MY ARMS I TURNED
GENTLY I PULLED ON IT TO STRENGTHEN ITS HOLD BUT WHETHER IT WOULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF MY BODY I DID NOT KNOW IT MIGHT BE BARELY CAUGHT UPON THE VERY OUTER VERGE OF THE ROOF
I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF OBSERVING A REGIMENT OF AS TRACTABLE AND DOCILE MOUNTS AS ONE MIGHT CARE TO SEE THE EFFECT ON THE PRECISION AND CELERITY OF THE MILITARY MOVEMENTS WAS SO REMARKABLE THAT LORQUAS PTOMEL PRESENTED ME WITH A MASSIVE
AS WELL AS IN THE TRAINING OF MY THOATS THE FEW TIMES I HAD VISITED HER QUARTERS SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT WALKING UPON THE STREETS WITH SOLA OR INVESTIGATING THE BUILDINGS IN THE NEAR VICINITY OF THE PLAZA
ALTHOUGH I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE TERM A RELIGIOUS MAN SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER I HAD RETURNED HOME FROM MY LAST VISIT
SOME DAY YOU SHALL KNOW JOHN CARTER IF WE LIVE BUT I MAY NOT TELL YOU AND I
AS I TOUCHED THE CORD THE SKELETONS SWUNG TO THE MOTION WITH A NOISE AS OF THE RUSTLING OF DRY LEAVES IT WAS A MOST GROTESQUE AND HORRID TABLEAU AND I HASTENED OUT INTO THE FRESH AIR GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM SO GRUESOME A PLACE
I HAD WARNED THEM AGAINST VENTURING FAR FROM THE PLAZA FOR FEAR OF THE GREAT WHITE APES WHOSE FEROCITY I WAS ONLY TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HOWEVER SINCE WOOLA ACCOMPANIED THEM ON ALL THEIR EXCURSIONS AND AS SOLA WAS WELL ARMED
SHOW ME HOW YOU ACCOMPLISH THESE RESULTS WAS TARS TARKAS ONLY REJOINDER AND SO I EXPLAINED AS CAREFULLY AS I COULD THE ENTIRE METHOD OF TRAINING I HAD ADOPTED WITH MY BEASTS AND LATER HE HAD ME REPEAT IT BEFORE LORQUAS PTOMEL AND THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS
THAT SHOULD YOU ACCIDENTALLY WOUND AN ENEMY YOU WOULD TAKE HIM HOME AND NURSE HIM BACK TO HEALTH SHE LAUGHED THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT WE DO ON EARTH I ANSWERED AT LEAST AMONG CIVILIZED MEN THIS MADE HER LAUGH AGAIN
I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP US APART SHE CONTINUED FOR WHENEVER YOU HAVE BEEN OFF DUTY ONE OF THE OLDER WOMEN OF TARS TARKAS RETINUE HAS ALWAYS ARRANGED TO TRUMP UP SOME EXCUSE TO GET SOLA AND ME OUT OF SIGHT
LED DIRECTLY TO HIS APARTMENTS AND WAS KNOWN ONLY TO HIM IF I CAN REACH THE ROOF OF THE BARRACKS AND GET MY MACHINE I CAN BE IN SAB THAN'S QUARTERS IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HOW AM I TO ESCAPE FROM THIS BUILDING GUARDED AS YOU SAY IT IS
WHAT CAN BE DONE JOHN CARTER HE CONTINUED YOU ARE A RESOURCEFUL MAN CAN YOU NOT THINK OF SOME WAY TO SAVE HELIUM FROM THIS DISGRACE IF I CAN COME WITHIN SWORD'S REACH OF SAB THAN I ANSWERED
I CAN SOLVE THE DIFFICULTY IN SO FAR AS HELIUM IS CONCERNED BUT FOR PERSONAL REASONS I WOULD PREFER THAT ANOTHER STRUCK THE BLOW THAT FREES DEJAH THORIS KANTOS KAN EYED ME NARROWLY BEFORE HE SPOKE
I SOON REACHED AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE BUILDING WHERE I HOPED TO FIND THE HELIUMITE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT I STOOD IN THE ROOM BEFORE HIM HE WAS ALONE AND SHOWED NO SURPRISE AT MY COMING SAYING HE HAD EXPECTED ME MUCH EARLIER
GRADUALLY I LEFT MY PURSUERS FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND AND I WAS JUST CONGRATULATING MYSELF ON MY LUCKY ESCAPE
THE SILVERED MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE THE ALMOST STATIONARY MOON HANGING IN THE SKY THE CACTI STUDDED VALLEY BELOW ME WERE NOT OF MARS
I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM HIM ASKING ME TO COME TO HIM AT ONCE I HAD
I LOST NO TIME IN EXPLANATION BUT PLUNGED IMMEDIATELY INTO A DISCUSSION OF OUR PLANS FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
THEY KNOW THAT I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TEN THOUSAND JEDDAKS THAT I TRACE MY ANCESTRY STRAIGHT BACK WITHOUT A BREAK TO THE BUILDER OF THE FIRST GREAT WATERWAY
I HASTENED TO THE SHEDS AND SOON HAD OUT BOTH MY MACHINE AND KANTOS KAN'S
LOOKING UP INTO THE HEAVENS AT WHAT I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I READ HIS MANUSCRIPT YEARS AFTERWARD HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD BEEN PROSPECTING AND MINING IN ARIZONA PART OF THE TIME SINCE THE WAR
WHICH HE PREVIOUSLY HAD HAD CONSTRUCTED AND WHICH AS I LATER LEARNED
LOST IN THE SKY WITHOUT EFFORT AT CONCEALMENT I HASTENED TO THE VICINITY OF OUR QUARTERS
THE SIGHT THAT MET MY EYES AS I STEPPED OUT UPON A SMALL LEDGE WHICH RAN BEFORE THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE FILLED ME WITH CONSTERNATION A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW LANDSCAPE MET MY GAZE
THE BUILDING WAS AN ENORMOUS ONE REARING ITS LOFTY HEAD FULLY A THOUSAND FEET INTO THE AIR BUT FEW BUILDINGS IN ZODANGA WERE HIGHER THAN THESE BARRACKS THOUGH SEVERAL TOPPED IT BY A FEW HUNDRED FEET
FOR TO BE CAUGHT ON THE OPEN PLAINS WITH A CAVALCADE OF CHARIOTS AND CHILDREN WAS FAR FROM THE DESIRE OF EVEN SO WARLIKE A PEOPLE AS THE GREEN MARTIANS DURING OUR PERIOD OF INACTIVITY
THERE WAS ONE SLIGHT DESPERATE CHANCE AND THAT I DECIDED I MUST TAKE IT WAS FOR DEJAH THORIS AND NO MAN HAS LIVED WHO WOULD NOT RISK A THOUSAND DEATHS FOR SUCH AS SHE CLINGING TO THE WALL WITH MY FEET
THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY AND SO I ESSAYED THE TASK THE FACT THAT BARSOOMIAN ARCHITECTURE IS EXTREMELY ORNATE MADE THE FEAT MUCH SIMPLER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED SINCE I FOUND ORNAMENTAL LEDGES AND PROJECTIONS
DURING THE DAYS JUST PRECEDING OUR DEPARTURE I HAD SEEN BUT LITTLE OF DEJAH THORIS
LEFT ALONE IN THE STUDY I OPENED THE SAFE AND WITHDREW THE CONTENTS OF THE DRAWER IN WHICH HE HAD TOLD ME I WOULD FIND MY INSTRUCTIONS THEY WERE IN PART PECULIAR INDEED
I ANSWERED TURNING TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE ROOF WHERE TWENTY FEET BELOW AT THE END OF MY STRAP HUNG ALL MY WEAPONS THE FELLOW ACTING ON IMPULSE OF CURIOSITY STEPPED TO MY SIDE AND TO HIS UNDOING
WHERE I HAD SEEN HIM ON THOSE OTHER NIGHTS WITH HIS ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION TO THE SKIES THERE WERE NO MARKS OF VIOLENCE ON THE BODY AND WITH THE AID OF A LOCAL PHYSICIAN THE CORONER'S JURY QUICKLY REACHED A DECISION OF DEATH FROM HEART FAILURE
WITH THE CARRIAGE OF THE TRAINED FIGHTING MAN HIS FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND CLEAR CUT HIS HAIR BLACK AND CLOSELY CROPPED WHILE HIS EYES WERE OF A STEEL GRAY REFLECTING A STRONG AND LOYAL CHARACTER FILLED WITH FIRE
THEIR BULLETS EXPLODE WHEN THEY STRIKE AN OBJECT WELL THE OPAQUE OUTER COATING IS BROKEN BY THE IMPACT EXPOSING A GLASS CYLINDER ALMOST SOLID IN THE FORWARD END OF WHICH IS A MINUTE PARTICLE OF RADIUM POWDER
OR THE SPEED AT WHICH I WAS TRAVELING MY CHANCES FOR FINDING IT WERE SLIM HELIUM LIES A THOUSAND MILES SOUTHWEST OF ZODANGA AND WITH MY COMPASS INTACT I SHOULD HAVE MADE THE TRIP
TARS TARKAS HAD INSTRUCTED ME IN MANY OF THE CUSTOMS AND ARTS OF WAR FAMILIAR TO THE THARKS INCLUDING LESSONS IN RIDING AND GUIDING THE GREAT BEASTS WHICH BORE THE WARRIORS THESE CREATURES WHICH ARE KNOWN AS THOATS ARE AS DANGEROUS AND VICIOUS AS THEIR MASTERS BUT WHEN ONCE SUBDUED
THOUGH UPON SOME OTHER BEAST IF NOT HIS TORN AND MANGLED BODY WAS GATHERED UP BY HIS WOMEN AND BURNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THARKIAN CUSTOM
FILLED HIM WITH DISMAY IT CANNOT BE HE EXCLAIMED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WHY NO MAN IN ALL HELIUM BUT WOULD PREFER DEATH TO THE SELLING OF OUR LOVED PRINCESS TO THE RULING HOUSE OF ZODANGA
I ASKED FEELING THE HOT BLOOD OF MY FIGHTING ANCESTORS LEAP IN MY VEINS AS I AWAITED HER REPLY ONLY IN LITTLE WAYS JOHN CARTER SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THAT CAN HARM ME OUTSIDE MY PRIDE
IF SUCCESSFUL HE WAS THEN TO FOLLOW ME HE SET MY COMPASS FOR ME A CLEVER LITTLE DEVICE WHICH WILL REMAIN STEADFASTLY FIXED UPON ANY GIVEN POINT ON THE SURFACE OF BARSOOM AND BIDDING EACH OTHER FAREWELL WE ROSE TOGETHER
AS I GAINED MY FEET I WAS CONFRONTED BY THE SENTRY ON DUTY INTO THE MUZZLE OF WHOSE REVOLVER I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING WHO ARE YOU AND WHENCE CAME YOU HE CRIED
THEY HAVE HAD ME DOWN IN THE PITS BELOW THE BUILDINGS HELPING THEM MIX THEIR AWFUL RADIUM POWDER AND MAKE THEIR TERRIBLE PROJECTILES YOU KNOW THAT THESE HAVE TO BE MANUFACTURED BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT
FOR EVEN THOUGH WE DIE AT THEIR HANDS WE CAN AFFORD THEM PITY SINCE WE ARE GREATER THAN THEY AND THEY KNOW IT
THERE WAS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE CAUSE FOR FEAR ON THE EVENING BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE I SAW THEM APPROACHING ALONG ONE OF THE GREAT AVENUES WHICH LEAD INTO THE PLAZA FROM THE EAST
BUT I HOPE NEVERTHELESS THAT I MAY BE PRESENT THE NEXT TIME THAT ANY MARTIAN GREEN RED PINK OR VIOLET HAS THE TEMERITY TO EVEN SO MUCH AS FROWN ON YOU MY PRINCESS
I AM AN AIR SCOUT FRIEND AND VERY NEAR A DEAD ONE FOR JUST BY THE MEREST CHANCE I ESCAPED FALLING TO THE AVENUE BELOW I REPLIED BUT HOW CAME YOU UPON THE ROOF MAN NO ONE HAS LANDED OR COME UP FROM THE BUILDING FOR THE PAST HOUR
AND BY MEANS OF WHICH LANDING PARTIES ARE LOWERED TO THE GROUND FROM THE BATTLESHIPS I SWUNG THIS HOOK CAUTIOUSLY
DID THE VITALIZING AIR REACH THE PEOPLE OF THAT DISTANT PLANET IN TIME TO SAVE THEM
OR DID HER BEAUTIFUL BODY LIE COLD IN DEATH BESIDE THE TINY GOLDEN INCUBATOR IN THE SUNKEN GARDEN
ONE OF THESE MATCHES I STRUCK AND ITS DIM FLAME LIGHTED UP WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HUGE CAVE TOWARD THE BACK OF WHICH I DISCOVERED A STRANGE STILL FIGURE HUDDLED OVER A TINY BENCH AS I APPROACHED IT
AND A VOICE ROARED OUT A COMMAND TO HALT FOLLOWING WITH A SHOT AS I PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIS HAIL KANTOS KAN DROPPED QUICKLY INTO THE DARKNESS WHILE I ROSE STEADILY
AS MY TOUR OF DUTY MUST HAVE ENDED SOME TIME SINCE I SAW THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AT THE PALACE AND WHEN I HAD ENLIGHTENED HIM HE WAS ALL EXCITEMENT THE NEWS THAT DEJAH THORIS HAD PROMISED HER HAND TO SAB THAN
AND ONE HAND I UNLOOSENED ONE OF THE LONG LEATHER STRAPS OF MY TRAPPINGS AT THE END OF WHICH DANGLED A GREAT HOOK BY WHICH AIR SAILORS ARE HUNG TO THE SIDES AND BOTTOMS OF THEIR CRAFT FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES OF REPAIR
EVEN IN THAT COUNTRY OF MAGNIFICENT HORSEMEN I HAVE OFTEN HEARD MY FATHER CAUTION HIM AGAINST HIS WILD RECKLESSNESS BUT HE WOULD ONLY LAUGH AND SAY THAT THE TUMBLE THAT KILLED HIM WOULD BE FROM THE BACK OF A HORSE YET UNFOALED
A MOMENT THEN RAISED IT WITH AN AIR OF CONFIDENCE I ONLY NEED TO PASS THESE GUARDS AND I CAN DO IT HE SAID AT LAST
WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT HE LEFT US NOR DID I SEE HIM AGAIN FOR SOME FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS WHEN HE RETURNED IT WAS WITHOUT WARNING AND I WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO NOTE THAT HE HAD NOT AGED APPARENTLY A MOMENT
UNSEEN THE UPPER STORY WHERE OUR APARTMENTS WERE SITUATED WAS THROUGH AN ADJOINING BUILDING AND AFTER CONSIDERABLE MANEUVERING I MANAGED TO ATTAIN THE ROOF OF A SHOP SEVERAL DOORS AWAY LEAPING FROM ROOF TO ROOF
UNUSUAL I THEREFORE DREW NEAR AND DISCOVERED THAT THE POSSESSOR OF THE PEERING FACE WAS NONE OTHER THAN SAB THAN HE WAS SLIGHTLY PUT OUT AT BEING DETECTED AND COMMANDED ME TO KEEP THE MATTER TO MYSELF EXPLAINING THAT THE PASSAGE FROM THE TOWER
THE DOCKS OF THE GREAT BATTLESHIPS OF THE LINE STANDING SOME FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET FROM THE GROUND WHILE THE FREIGHT AND PASSENGER STATIONS OF THE MERCHANT SQUADRONS ROSE NEARLY AS HIGH IT WAS A LONG CLIMB UP THE FACE OF THE BUILDING AND ONE FRAUGHT WITH MUCH DANGER BUT
I MANAGED TO ELUDE THEIR SEARCH LIGHTS MOST OF THE TIME BUT I WAS ALSO LOSING GROUND BY THESE TACTICS AND SO I DECIDED TO HAZARD EVERYTHING ON A STRAIGHT AWAY COURSE AND LEAVE THE RESULT TO FATE AND THE SPEED OF MY MACHINE
A STRANGE FEATURE ABOUT THE TOMB WHERE HIS BODY STILL LIES IS THAT THE MASSIVE DOOR IS EQUIPPED WITH A SINGLE HUGE GOLD PLATED SPRING LOCK WHICH CAN BE OPENED ONLY FROM THE INSIDE
AND THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL WAS EVIDENCED BY THE UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY WITH WHICH HE WAS SUPPLIED
ANKLET OF GOLD FROM HIS OWN LEG AS A SIGN OF HIS APPRECIATION OF MY SERVICE TO THE HORDE ON THE SEVENTH DAY FOLLOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE AIR CRAFT WE AGAIN TOOK UP THE MARCH TOWARD THARK ALL PROBABILITY OF ANOTHER ATTACK BEING DEEMED REMOTE
THAT MOMENT MARKED THE BEGINNING OF A NEW EXISTENCE FOR THE POOR THOATS
FOR DEJAH THORIS AND FOR YOU THIS VERY NIGHT I SHALL TRY TO REACH HIS QUARTERS IN THE PALACE HOW I ASKED YOU ARE STRONGLY GUARDED AND A QUADRUPLE FORCE PATROLS THE SKY HE BENT HIS HEAD IN THOUGHT
THAT SHE SHARED MY SENTIMENTS IN THIS RESPECT I WAS POSITIVE FOR ON MY APPROACH THE LOOK OF PITIFUL HOPELESSNESS LEFT HER SWEET COUNTENANCE TO BE REPLACED BY A SMILE OF JOYFUL WELCOME
DAY HAD NOW GIVEN AWAY TO NIGHT AND AS WE WANDERED ALONG THE GREAT AVENUE LIGHTED BY THE TWO MOONS OF BARSOOM AND WITH EARTH LOOKING DOWN UPON US OUT OF HER LUMINOUS GREEN EYE IT SEEMED THAT WE WERE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE AND I AT LEAST
AS SHE PLACED HER LITTLE RIGHT HAND UPON MY LEFT SHOULDER IN TRUE RED MARTIAN SALUTE SARKOJA TOLD SOLA THAT YOU HAD BECOME A TRUE THARK SHE SAID
IN FACT HE WOULD NOT TALK OF THEM AT ALL HE REMAINED WITH US FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND THEN WENT TO NEW YORK WHERE HE PURCHASED A LITTLE PLACE ON THE HUDSON WHERE I VISITED HIM ONCE A YEAR ON THE OCCASIONS OF MY TRIPS TO THE NEW YORK MARKET
WHO REPRESENTED TO ME ALL THAT I HAD LEFT BEHIND UPON EARTH IN AGREEABLE AND CONGENIAL COMPANIONSHIP THERE SEEMED BONDS OF MUTUAL INTEREST BETWEEN US AS POWERFUL AS
AND TONIGHT SHE SEEMS CALLING TO ME AGAIN AS SHE HAS NOT CALLED BEFORE SINCE THAT LONG DEAD NIGHT AND I THINK I CAN SEE ACROSS THAT AWFUL ABYSS OF SPACE A BEAUTIFUL BLACK HAIRED WOMAN STANDING IN THE GARDEN OF A PALACE AND AT HER SIDE IS A LITTLE BOY WHO PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HER
AS IT TURNED OUT HOWEVER MORNING FOUND ME SPEEDING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF DEAD SEA BOTTOM AFTER NEARLY SIX HOURS OF CONTINUOUS FLIGHT AT HIGH SPEED PRESENTLY A GREAT CITY SHOWED BELOW ME BUT IT WAS NOT HELIUM
ONLY A FEW DAYS SINCE YOU YOURSELF TOLD ME THAT THESE GREAT BRUTES BY THE UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR TEMPERS OFTEN WERE THE MEANS OF TURNING VICTORY INTO DEFEAT SINCE AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT THEY MIGHT ELECT TO UNSEAT AND REND THEIR RIDERS
AND THEN HUNG HIM OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF AS I MYSELF HAD HUNG A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE I KNEW IT WOULD BE MORNING BEFORE HE WOULD BE DISCOVERED AND I NEEDED ALL THE TIME THAT I COULD GAIN DONNING MY TRAPPINGS AND WEAPONS
I ADVANCED TO MEET THEM AND TELLING SOLA THAT I WOULD TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEJAH THORIS SAFEKEEPING I DIRECTED HER TO RETURN TO HER QUARTERS ON SOME TRIVIAL ERRAND I LIKED AND TRUSTED SOLA BUT FOR SOME REASON I DESIRED TO BE ALONE WITH DEJAH THORIS
SHE SOLILOQUIZED IN CONCLUSION THEN SHE BROKE OUT AGAIN INTO ONE OF HER GAY HAPPY LAUGHING MOODS JOKING WITH ME ON MY PROWESS AS A THARK WARRIOR AS CONTRASTED WITH MY SOFT HEART AND NATURAL KINDLINESS I PRESUME
I FELL UPON IT BY CHANCE ONE DAY AS I WAS PASSING ABOVE THE PALACE ON PATROL DUTY IN THIS WORK IT IS REQUIRED THAT WE INVESTIGATE ANY UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE WE MAY WITNESS AND A FACE PEERING FROM THE PINNACLE OF THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE WAS TO ME MOST
AND SO I HASTENED TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMAND I ARRIVED AT THE LITTLE STATION ABOUT A MILE FROM HIS GROUNDS ON THE MORNING OF MARCH FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX
BUT NONE RESEMBLING THE DESCRIPTION WHICH KANTOS KAN HAD GIVEN ME OF HELIUM
BEHIND HER DEPENDING FROM THE ROOF UPON RAWHIDE THONGS AND STRETCHING ENTIRELY ACROSS THE CAVE WAS A ROW OF HUMAN SKELETONS FROM THE THONG WHICH HELD THEM STRETCHED ANOTHER TO THE DEAD HAND OF THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN
WHICH IS EVER OLDEST YET EVER NEW I LOVED DEJAH THORIS THE TOUCH OF MY ARM UPON HER NAKED SHOULDER HAD SPOKEN TO ME IN WORDS I WOULD NOT MISTAKE
FAR BELOW ME LAY THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED STREETS THE HARD PAVEMENTS AND DEATH THERE WAS A LITTLE JERK AT THE TOP OF THE SUPPORTING EAVES
A MOMENT BEFORE AND SO I CONTINUED TO IMPORTUNE HER TO ENLIGHTEN ME NO SHE EXCLAIMED IT IS ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE SAID IT AND THAT I HAVE LISTENED AND WHEN YOU LEARN JOHN CARTER AND IF I BE DEAD
I FELT MYSELF OVER FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND FROM HEAD TO FOOT I WAS CLOTHED
THE JEDDAK OF HELIUM FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE WAITED AND PRAYED FOR AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTIONS FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE WAITED AND PRAYED TO BE TAKEN BACK TO THE WORLD OF MY LOST LOVE I WOULD RATHER LIE DEAD BESIDE HER THERE
I COULD TAKE A HUMAN LIFE IF NECESSARY WITH FAR LESS COMPUNCTION THAN THAT OF A POOR
THEY WERE DEALT A TERRIFIC BLOW BETWEEN THE EARS WITH THE BUTT OF A PISTOL AND IF THEY SHOWED FIGHT THIS TREATMENT WAS CONTINUED UNTIL THE BRUTES EITHER WERE SUBDUED OR HAD UNSEATED THEIR RIDERS
SHE MUST HAVE LOST HER MIND TO HAVE ASSENTED TO SUCH AN ATROCIOUS BARGAIN YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW WE OF HELIUM LOVE THE MEMBERS OF OUR RULING HOUSE CANNOT APPRECIATE THE HORROR WITH WHICH I CONTEMPLATE SUCH AN UNHOLY ALLIANCE
IF I WAS A FRIEND OF THE CAPTAIN'S HE HAD SOME VERY BAD NEWS FOR ME THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD SHORTLY AFTER DAYLIGHT THAT VERY MORNING BY THE WATCHMAN ATTACHED TO AN ADJOINING PROPERTY FOR SOME REASON THIS NEWS DID NOT SURPRISE ME BUT
AND THEREFORE MY FIGHTING EFFICIENCY IS ENHANCED AND I AM A BETTER WARRIOR FOR THE REASON THAT I AM A KIND MASTER YOUR OTHER WARRIORS WOULD FIND IT TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THEMSELVES AS WELL AS OF THE COMMUNITY TO ADOPT MY METHODS IN THIS RESPECT
AS I NEARED THE BUILDING I BECAME MORE CAREFUL AS I JUDGED AND RIGHTLY THAT THE PLACE WOULD BE GUARDED SEVERAL MEN IN CIVILIAN METAL LOITERED NEAR THE FRONT ENTRANCE AND IN THE REAR WERE OTHERS MY ONLY MEANS OF REACHING
THAN LIVE ON EARTH ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF TERRIBLE MILES FROM HER THE OLD MINE WHICH I FOUND UNTOUCHED HAS MADE ME FABULOUSLY WEALTHY BUT WHAT CARE I FOR WEALTH
LONGER THAN THE ACT OF ADJUSTING THE SILK REQUIRED SHE DID NOT DRAW AWAY NOR DID SHE SPEAK AND SO IN SILENCE WE WALKED THE SURFACE OF A DYING WORLD BUT IN THE BREAST OF ONE OF US AT LEAST HAD BEEN BORN THAT
AS WE NEARED THE HIGH TOWER A PATROL SHOT DOWN FROM ABOVE
TELLING ME I WOULD FIND HIS WILL THERE AND SOME PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS WHICH HE HAD ME PLEDGE MYSELF TO CARRY OUT WITH ABSOLUTE FIDELITY AFTER I HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT
GRATING SOUND WHICH TURNED ME COLD WITH APPREHENSION THEN THE HOOK CAUGHT AND I WAS SAFE CLAMBERING QUICKLY ALOFT I GRASPED THE EDGE OF THE EAVES AND DREW MYSELF TO THE SURFACE OF THE ROOF ABOVE
ASKED TARS TARKAS ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD SEEN ME RUN MY ARM FAR BETWEEN THE GREAT JAWS OF ONE OF MY THOATS WHICH HAD WEDGED A PIECE OF STONE BETWEEN TWO OF HIS TEETH WHILE FEEDING UPON THE MOSS LIKE VEGETATION WITHIN OUR COURT YARD
I ASKED THERE IS USUALLY BUT ONE MAN ON DUTY THERE AT NIGHT UPON THE ROOF GO TO THE ROOF OF THIS BUILDING KANTOS KAN AND WAIT ME THERE
EVIDENTLY IN SEARCH OF ME NOT UNTIL THEIR LIGHTS WERE NO LONGER DISCERNIBLE DID I VENTURE TO FLASH MY LITTLE LAMP UPON MY COMPASS
BUT I HAVE FOLLOWED THEM TO EACH LAST DETAIL AS FAITHFULLY AS I WAS ABLE HE DIRECTED THAT I REMOVE HIS BODY TO VIRGINIA WITHOUT EMBALMING AND THAT HE BE LAID IN AN OPEN COFFIN WITHIN A TOMB
LOVE MAKING ON MARS FOLLOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE AIR SHIPS THE COMMUNITY REMAINED WITHIN THE CITY FOR SEVERAL DAYS ABANDONING THE HOMEWARD MARCH UNTIL THEY COULD FEEL REASONABLY ASSURED THAT THE SHIPS WOULD NOT RETURN
SHE KNOWS IT KANTOS KAN AND REPULSES ME ONLY BECAUSE SHE IS PROMISED TO SAB THAN THE SPLENDID FELLOW SPRANG TO HIS FEET
AND INITIATIVE HIS MANNERS WERE PERFECT AND HIS COURTLINESS WAS THAT OF A TYPICAL SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN OF THE HIGHEST TYPE HIS HORSEMANSHIP ESPECIALLY AFTER HOUNDS WAS A MARVEL AND DELIGHT
BY KINDNESS I REPLIED YOU SEE TARS TARKAS THE SOFTER SENTIMENTS HAVE THEIR VALUE EVEN TO A WARRIOR IN THE HEIGHT OF BATTLE AS WELL AS UPON THE MARCH I KNOW THAT MY THOATS WILL OBEY MY EVERY COMMAND
IN SUBMITTING CAPTAIN CARTER'S STRANGE MANUSCRIPT TO YOU IN BOOK FORM I BELIEVE THAT A FEW WORDS RELATIVE TO THIS REMARKABLE PERSONALITY WILL BE OF INTEREST MY FIRST RECOLLECTION OF CAPTAIN CARTER IS OF THE FEW MONTHS
I HAVE SEEN HIM FROM MY WINDOW STANDING IN THE MOONLIGHT ON THE BRINK OF THE BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE HUDSON WITH HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT TO THE HEAVENS AS THOUGH IN APPEAL I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS PRAYING
I OBSERVED HE WAS MUCH OCCUPIED IN WRITING I PRESUME NOW UPON THIS MANUSCRIPT HE TOLD ME AT THIS TIME THAT IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HIM HE WISHED ME TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIS ESTATE
THE TOP FLOOR WAS ALIGHT AND FILLED WITH SOLDIERS ENGAGED IN THE PASTIMES OF THEIR KIND
AND GAZED UPON ME WITH DILATED EYES AND QUICKENING BREATH
WHICH BROUGHT ROGUISH DIMPLES TO THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND CRIED WHAT A CHILD A GREAT WARRIOR AND YET A STUMBLING LITTLE CHILD WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW I ASKED IN SORE PERPLEXITY
AND HAD THE CHOICE BEEN LEFT TO ME I COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A MORE FITTING MATE FOR THE FIRST PRINCESS OF BARSOOM HERE IS MY HAND UPON YOUR SHOULDER JOHN CARTER AND MY WORD
WAS CONTENT THAT IT SHOULD BE SO THE CHILL OF THE MARTIAN NIGHT WAS UPON US AND REMOVING MY SILKS I THREW THEM ACROSS THE SHOULDERS OF DEJAH THORIS AS MY ARM RESTED FOR AN INSTANT UPON HER I FELT A THRILL PASS THROUGH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING
YES MY DEAR REPLIED MISSUS ALLEN WITH PERFECT SERENITY IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE INDEED
THEY LOOKED RATHER COMICAL ALL STANDING IN STIFF STRAIGHT ROWS ONE AFTER THE OTHER BUT MARY DID NOT MIND THAT WHILE SHE WAS WORKING SHE HEARD THE TRAMP OF A HORSE'S HOOFS AND LOOKING UP
AND AFTERWARDS DROVE THROUGH THOSE STREETS WHICH CONDUCTED THEM TO THE HOTEL SHE WAS COME TO BE HAPPY AND SHE FELT HAPPY ALREADY THEY WERE SOON SETTLED IN COMFORTABLE LODGINGS IN PULTENEY STREET
SHE WAS LOOKED AT HOWEVER AND WITH SOME ADMIRATION FOR IN HER OWN HEARING TWO GENTLEMEN PRONOUNCED HER TO BE A PRETTY GIRL SUCH WORDS HAD THEIR DUE EFFECT
WILL BE NATURALLY SUPPOSED TO BE MOST SEVERE A THOUSAND ALARMING PRESENTIMENTS OF EVIL TO HER BELOVED CATHERINE FROM THIS TERRIFIC SEPARATION MUST OPPRESS HER HEART WITH SADNESS
SHE WAS FILLED WITH JOY WHEN ONE MORNING SHE RAN OUT TO HER FLOWER GARDEN AFTER BREAKFAST AND FOUND THE DINGLE BELLS AND COWSLIPS WERE ACTUALLY BLOSSOMING WHILE EVEN THE COCKLE SHELLS WERE SHOWING THEIR WHITE BUDS
ON HAVING PRESERVED HER GOWN FROM INJURY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SHOCKING TO HAVE IT TORN
WHO HAD HEARD WHAT THE SAILOR HAD SAID TO HIS LITTLE GIRL KNEW AT ONCE WHAT MARY MEANT SO SHE KISSED HER DAUGHTER AND REPLIED YES MARY YOU MAY HAVE THE FLOWER GARDEN IF YOU WISH WE WILL DIG A NICE LITTLE BED JUST AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE
YOU LL SEE I KNOW QUITE WELL THAT HIDDEN IN EACH MOSSY NOOK IS MANY A COCKLE SHELL THIS WAS INDEED TRUE AND AS MARY SAW THEM SHE SUDDENLY DROPPED HER HEAD AND BEGAN TO WEEP
WERE ALL THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR HER BEING THE CHOICE OF A SENSIBLE INTELLIGENT MAN LIKE MISTER ALLEN IN ONE RESPECT SHE WAS ADMIRABLY FITTED TO INTRODUCE A YOUNG LADY INTO PUBLIC
MISSUS ALLEN WAS ONE OF THAT NUMEROUS CLASS OF FEMALES WHOSE SOCIETY CAN RAISE NO OTHER EMOTION THAN SURPRISE AT THERE BEING ANY MEN IN THE WORLD WHO COULD LIKE THEM WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY THEM
WHEN YOU COME FROM THE ROOMS AT NIGHT AND I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO KEEP SOME ACCOUNT OF THE MONEY YOU SPEND I WILL GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE BOOK ON PURPOSE SALLY OR RATHER SARAH
SHE WAS INCLINED TO BE A BIT CONTRARY AND PUT HER OWN OPINIONS AND IDEAS BEFORE THOSE OF HER ELDERS PERHAPS MARY MEANT NO WRONG IN THIS
STROKING HER CURLS TENDERLY AS HE SPOKE WELL WELL MY DARLING IT WILL BE A LONG TIME INDEED DO YOU KNOW THE COWSLIPS THAT GROW IN THE PASTURES MARY OH YES I WATCH FOR THEM EVERY SPRING SHE ANSWERED
WITH A DEGREE OF MODERATION AND COMPOSURE WHICH SEEMED RATHER CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMON FEELINGS OF COMMON LIFE THAN WITH THE REFINED SUSCEPTIBILITIES THE TENDER EMOTIONS WHICH THE FIRST SEPARATION OF A HEROINE FROM HER FAMILY OUGHT ALWAYS TO EXCITE
AND BY THE PATH THAT RUNS BESIDE THE WOOD SO HE GAVE THE REIN TO HIS MARE AND THEY RODE ALONG CHATTING MERRILY TOGETHER TILL THEY CAME TO THE WOOD THEN SAID THE SQUIRE TAKE A LOOK WITHIN THAT NOOK AND TELL ME WHAT IS THERE
AND BOTH MISSUS ALLEN AND HER MAID DECLARED SHE LOOKED QUITE AS SHE SHOULD DO WITH SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT CATHERINE HOPED AT LEAST TO PASS UNCENSURED THROUGH THE CROWD AS FOR ADMIRATION
HOW OLD FASHIONED IT IS LOOK AT THE BACK AFTER SOME TIME THEY RECEIVED AN OFFER OF TEA FROM ONE OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS IT WAS THANKFULLY ACCEPTED AND THIS INTRODUCED A LIGHT CONVERSATION WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO OFFERED IT
I WISH YOU COULD DANCE MY DEAR I WISH YOU COULD GET A PARTNER FOR SOME TIME HER YOUNG FRIEND FELT OBLIGED TO HER FOR THESE WISHES BUT THEY WERE REPEATED SO OFTEN
FOR MY PART I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING I LIKE SO WELL IN THE WHOLE ROOM I ASSURE YOU HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS WHISPERED CATHERINE NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE ACQUAINTANCE HERE
MARY'S MOTHER KNEW THAT THE HARSH WINDS HAD KILLED THE FLOWERS BEFORE THEIR TIME BUT SHE DID NOT LIKE TO DISAPPOINT HER DARLING SO SHE ONLY SAID WITH A SIGH I HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT MARY
IT MAY BE STATED FOR THE READER'S MORE CERTAIN INFORMATION LEST THE FOLLOWING PAGES SHOULD OTHERWISE FAIL OF GIVING ANY IDEA OF WHAT HER CHARACTER IS MEANT TO BE THAT HER HEART WAS AFFECTIONATE HER DISPOSITION CHEERFUL AND OPEN
YOUR FATHER MEANT YOU TO WATCH THE FLOWERS IN THE FIELD AND IF YOU WILL COME AND VISIT THEM EACH DAY YOU WILL FIND THE TIME WAITING VERY SHORT INDEED MARY DRIED HER EYES AND THANKED THE KINDLY OLD SQUIRE
ARE ALL WITHERED AND FADED AWAY AND DID YOU NOT SAY THAT GOD WILLING WHEN THIS HAPPENED YOU WOULD COME BACK TO US TO BE SURE I DID ANSWERED HER FATHER WITH A HAPPY LAUGH AND I MUST HAVE SPOKEN TRULY SWEETHEART
MISTRESS MARY SO CONTRARY HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW WITH DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW AND MARY BEING A SHARP LITTLE GIRL AND KNOWING THE SQUIRE'S QUEER WAYS
THEY SAW NOTHING OF THE DANCERS BUT THE HIGH FEATHERS OF SOME OF THE LADIES STILL THEY MOVED ON SOMETHING BETTER WAS YET IN VIEW AND BY A CONTINUED EXERTION OF STRENGTH AND INGENUITY
MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW WITH DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW HIGH UPON A CLIFF THAT OVERLOOKED THE SEA WAS A LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE
ASKED THE SQUIRE IN HIS KIND BLUFF VOICE AND MARY ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THE FLOWERS I MUCH ADMIRE YOU KNOW PAPA DID SAY HE WON'T BE HOME AGAIN SQUIRE TILL ALL HAVE PASSED AWAY
AND NOW MY PAPA'S COMING HOME FOR SO HE SURELY SAID AH SAID THE SQUIRE LOOKING AT HER CURIOUSLY I M AFRAID YOU ARE GETTING WAY AHEAD OF TIME SEE HERE MARY
AND THEN HE CONTINUED T IS APTLY SAID BUT PRITHEE MAID WHY THUS YOUR GARDEN FILL WHEN EV'RY FIELD THE SAME FLOWERS YIELD TO PLUCK THEM AS YOU WILL THAT IS A LONG STORY SQUIRE
AND HOW ABOUT THE COCKLE SHELLS THEM ALSO I KNOW SAID MARY EAGERLY FOR SHE WAS GLAD HER FATHER SHOULD FIND HER SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE FIELD FLOWERS THERE IS NOTHING PRETTIER THAN THE BIG WHITE FLOWERS OF THE COCKLE SHELLS
AT WHICH A LARGE PARTY WERE ALREADY PLACED WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO DO THERE OR ANYBODY TO SPEAK TO EXCEPT EACH OTHER MISSUS ALLEN CONGRATULATED HERSELF AS SOON AS THEY WERE SEATED
WITHOUT CONCEIT OR AFFECTATION OF ANY KIND HER MANNERS JUST REMOVED FROM THE AWKWARDNESS AND SHYNESS OF A GIRL HER PERSON PLEASING AND WHEN IN GOOD LOOKS PRETTY
AND AFTER THAT SHE VISITED THE FIELDS EACH DAY AND WATCHED THE FLOWERS GROW AND IT WAS NOT SO VERY LONG AS THE SQUIRE SAID BEFORE THE BLOSSOMS BEGAN TO WITHER AND FALL AWAY AND FINALLY ONE DAY MARY LOOKED OUT OVER THE SEA
AND SAW A LITTLE SPECK UPON THE WATERS THAT LOOKED LIKE A SAIL AND WHEN IT CAME NEARER AND HAD GROWN LARGER BOTH SHE AND HER MOTHER SAW THAT IT WAS THE SKYLARK COME HOME AGAIN
BEING AS FOND OF GOING EVERYWHERE AND SEEING EVERYTHING HERSELF AS ANY YOUNG LADY COULD BE DRESS WAS HER PASSION SHE HAD A MOST HARMLESS DELIGHT IN BEING FINE AND OUR HEROINE'S ENTREE INTO LIFE
WHY DO YOU THINK SO ASKED HER MOTHER BECAUSE THE COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ARE BOTH FADING AWAY AND DYING JUST AS THE DINGLE BELLS DID AND PAPA SAID WHEN THEY FADED AND WITHERED HE AND THE BOYS WOULD COME BACK TO US
AND THAT FORTUNATELY PROVED TO BE GROUNDLESS THEY ARRIVED AT BATH CATHERINE WAS ALL EAGER DELIGHT HER EYES WERE HERE THERE EVERYWHERE AS THEY APPROACHED ITS FINE AND STRIKING ENVIRONS
BUT TELL ME PAPA WHAT HAVE THE FLOWERS TO DO WITH YOUR COMING HOME WHY JUST THIS SWEETHEART RETURNED THE SAILOR GRAVELY ALL THE TIME THAT IT TAKES THE COWSLIPS AND DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS TO SPROUT FROM THE GROUND
SHE IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT THE EVENING PLEASANTER THAN SHE HAD FOUND IT BEFORE HER HUMBLE VANITY WAS CONTENTED SHE FELT MORE OBLIGED TO THE TWO YOUNG MEN FOR THIS SIMPLE PRAISE THAN A TRUE QUALITY HEROINE
I SHALL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN LITTLE ONE AND WATCH THE GARDEN GROW
THE WEATHER NOW BEGAN TO CHANGE AND THE COLD SEA WINDS BLEW EACH NIGHT OVER MARY'S GARDEN SHE DID NOT KNOW THIS FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS LYING SNUGLY TUCKED UP IN HER BED
MISSUS ALLEN MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE THRONG OF MEN BY THE DOOR AS SWIFTLY AS THE NECESSARY CAUTION WOULD ALLOW CATHERINE HOWEVER KEPT CLOSE AT HER SIDE AND LINKED HER ARM TOO FIRMLY WITHIN HER FRIEND'S TO BE TORN ASUNDER BY ANY COMMON EFFORT OF A STRUGGLING ASSEMBLY
FOR WE BOTH SHALL BE GLAD TO WELCOME OUR DEAR ONES HOME AGAIN BUT SOON AFTERWARD THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE CAME RIDING UP AS WAS HIS WONT TO WHERE MARY STOOD BY HER GARDEN AND HE AT ONCE ASKED
AND HER MOTHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE THE HOURS WERE VERY DULL AND TEDIOUS AND MARY COUNTED THE DAYS UNTIL THE SAILORS CAME HOME AGAIN ONE SPRING
UNDER THESE UNPROMISING AUSPICES THE PARTING TOOK PLACE AND THE JOURNEY BEGAN IT WAS PERFORMED WITH SUITABLE QUIETNESS AND UNEVENTFUL SAFETY NEITHER ROBBERS NOR TEMPESTS BEFRIENDED THEM
IT WAS ALWAYS VERY WELCOME WHEN IT CAME BUT SHE DID NOT DEPEND ON IT MISSUS ALLEN WAS SO LONG IN DRESSING THAT THEY DID NOT ENTER THE BALLROOM TILL LATE THE SEASON WAS FULL THE ROOM CROWDED
SOMETHING IS SURELY THE MATTER WITH BROTHER HOBART THE DINGLE BELLS ARE DYING SAID HER MOTHER AFTER LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE FLOWERS BUT THE REASON IS THAT THE COLD WINDS FROM THE SEA SWEPT RIGHT OVER YOUR GARDEN LAST NIGHT
FOR THEY ARE THE BIGGEST AND STRONGEST AND THE DINGLE BELLS SHALL BE BROTHER HOBART AND THE COWSLIPS BROTHER ROBART AND NOW I FEEL AS IF THE FLOWERS WERE REALLY MY DEAR ONES AND I MUST BE VERY CAREFUL THAT THEY COME TO NO HARM
PRAY TELL ME DEAR THOUGH MUCH I FEAR THE ANSWER SAD I KNOW HOW GROW THE STURDY COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW AND MARY LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH HER BRIGHT SMILE AND ANSWERED
AND NOT A GARDEN IN THE LAND CAN SHOW SO FAIR A SIGHT AND SO IT WAS FOR AS THEY RODE THROUGH THE PASTURES THE COWSLIPS BLOOMED ON EVERY HAND AND MARY'S EYES GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER AS SHE THOUGHT OF HER POOR GARDEN WITH ITS DEAD FLOWERS
AND YOU SHALL PLANT YOUR FLOWERS AND CARE FOR THEM YOURSELF I THINK I D RATHER HAVE THE FLOWERS AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE SAID MARY BUT WHY ENQUIRED HER MOTHER THEY WILL BE BETTER SHELTERED AT THE SIDE
THAT SHE COULD NOT RELIEVE THE IRKSOMENESS OF IMPRISONMENT BY THE EXCHANGE OF A SYLLABLE WITH ANY OF HER FELLOW CAPTIVES AND WHEN AT LAST ARRIVED IN THE TEA ROOM SHE FELT YET MORE THE AWKWARDNESS OF HAVING NO PARTY TO JOIN
SAID MARY BUT THIS MUCH I MAY TELL YOU
HER CAUTIONS WERE CONFINED TO THE FOLLOWING POINTS I BEG CATHERINE
HOW DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ARE GROWING OH SQUIRE SOBBED MARY I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE EACH DINGLE BELL I LOVED SO WELL BEFORE MY EYES IS DYING
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR FIFTEEN SONNETS IN CELEBRATION OF HER CHARMS AND WENT TO HER CHAIR IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH EVERYBODY
AND I THINK BECAUSE THE FLOWERS ARE STRONG AND HEARTY THAT YOU MAY KNOW YOUR FATHER AND BROTHERS ARE THE SAME
SHE NODDED AND SMILED TO HIM AND THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE RODE UP TO HER SIDE AND LOOKED DOWN WITH A SMILE AT HER FLOWERS THEN HE SAID TO HER IN RHYME FOR IT WAS A WAY OF SPEAKING THE JOLLY SQUIRE HAD
AND HOW LONG WILL YOU BE GONE PAPA ASKED MARY WHO WAS PERCHED UPON HER FATHER'S KNEE WHERE SHE COULD NESTLE HER SOFT CHEEK AGAINST HIS BUSHY WHISKERS
VERY AGREEABLE INDEED SHE REPLIED VAINLY ENDEAVOURING TO HIDE A GREAT YAWN I WISH SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DANCE SAID HIS WIFE I WISH WE COULD HAVE GOT A PARTNER FOR HER
I KNEW YOU WERE COMING SOON PAPA AND HOW DID YOU KNOW SWEETHEART HE ASKED GIVING HER AN EXTRA KISS BECAUSE I WATCHED THE FLOWERS
IN ADDITION TO WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID OF CATHERINE MORLAND'S PERSONAL AND MENTAL ENDOWMENTS WHEN ABOUT TO BE LAUNCHED INTO ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS OF A SIX WEEKS RESIDENCE IN BATH
HER FATHER INSTEAD OF GIVING HER AN UNLIMITED ORDER ON HIS BANKER OR EVEN PUTTING AN HUNDRED POUNDS BANK BILL INTO HER HANDS GAVE HER ONLY TEN GUINEAS AND PROMISED HER MORE WHEN SHE WANTED IT
AND PROVED SO TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL THAT CATHERINE GREW TIRED AT LAST AND WOULD THANK HER NO MORE THEY WERE NOT LONG ABLE HOWEVER TO ENJOY THE REPOSE OF THE EMINENCE THEY HAD SO LABORIOUSLY GAINED
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW PLEASED AND HAPPY THE SIGHT OF THE PRETTY LITTLE SHIP MADE THEM AND SOON AFTER WHEN MARY HAD BEEN HUGGED BY HER TWO SUNBURNED BROTHERS AND WAS CLASPED IN HER FATHER'S STRONG ARMS SHE WHISPERED
ASKED THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE FORGETTING HIS POETRY
AND THE WARM MORNING SUN USUALLY DROVE AWAY THE WINDS BUT HER MOTHER KNEW IT AND FEARED MARY'S GARDEN WOULD SUFFER ONE DAY MARY CAME INTO THE HOUSE WHERE HER MOTHER WAS AT WORK AND SAID GLEEFULLY
I HAVE BEEN SAYING HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF THE SKINNERS WERE HERE THIS WINTER INSTEAD OF LAST OR IF THE PARRYS HAD COME AS THEY TALKED OF ONCE SHE MIGHT HAVE DANCED WITH GEORGE PARRY I AM SO SORRY SHE HAS NOT HAD A PARTNER
SHE WAS NOW SEEN BY MANY YOUNG MEN WHO HAD NOT BEEN NEAR HER BEFORE NOT ONE HOWEVER STARTED WITH RAPTUROUS WONDER ON BEHOLDING HER NO WHISPER OF EAGER INQUIRY RAN ROUND THE ROOM
A FLOWER GARDEN REPEATED HER MOTHER IN SURPRISE WHY DO YOU WISH A FLOWER GARDEN MARY I WANT TO PLANT IN IT THE COCKLE SHELLS AND THE COWSLIPS AND THE DINGLE BELLS SHE ANSWERED AND HER MOTHER
AND NOW SHE PERMITTED MARY TO MAKE HER OWN GARDEN AND PLANT IT AS SHE WOULD SO MARY MADE A LONG NARROW BED AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND THEN SHE PREPARED TO PLANT HER FLOWERS IF YOU SCATTER THE SEEDS SAID HER MOTHER
MUST FROM SITUATION BE AT THIS TIME THE INTIMATE FRIEND AND CONFIDANTE OF HER SISTER IT IS REMARKABLE HOWEVER THAT SHE NEITHER INSISTED ON CATHERINE'S WRITING BY EVERY POST
NOR WAS SHE ONCE CALLED A DIVINITY BY ANYBODY YET CATHERINE WAS IN VERY GOOD LOOKS AND HAD THE COMPANY ONLY SEEN HER THREE YEARS BEFORE THEY WOULD NOW HAVE THOUGHT HER EXCEEDINGLY HANDSOME
THE FLOWER BED WILL LOOK VERY PRETTY NOW THIS WAS WHAT MARY WAS ABOUT TO DO BUT SINCE HER MOTHER ADVISED IT SHE TRIED TO THINK OF ANOTHER WAY FOR AS I SAID SHE WAS CONTRARY AT TIMES
AND MARY EXCLAIMED A DINGLE BELL AND TRUTH TO TELL IN FULL BLOOM I DECLARE THE SQUIRE NOW CLUCKED TO HIS NAG AND AS THEY RODE AWAY HE SAID NOW COME WITH ME AND YOU SHALL SEE A FIELD WITH COWSLIPS BRIGHT
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN MARY AND HER MOTHER HAD DRIED THEIR EYES WHICH HAD BEEN WET WITH GRIEF AT THE DEPARTURE OF THEIR LOVED ONES THE LITTLE GIRL ASKED EARNESTLY MAMMA MAY I MAKE A FLOWER GARDEN
BUT TO HER UTTER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND THAT TO PROCEED ALONG THE ROOM WAS BY NO MEANS THE WAY TO DISENGAGE THEMSELVES FROM THE CROWD IT SEEMED RATHER TO INCREASE AS THEY WENT ON
I VERY MUCH SUSPECT THE REAL REASON THEY ARE DYING IS BECAUSE THE COLD SEA WIND CAUGHT THEM LAST NIGHT DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE IF YOU HAD SCATTERED THE COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ABOUT THEM THE STRONGER PLANTS WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THE WEAKER BUT YOU SEE MY GIRL
WHEN THEY HAVE GROWN UP BIG AND STRONG SAID MARY ONE MORNING AS SHE WEEDED THE BED AND WHEN THEY HAVE BUDDED AND BLOSSOMED AND FADED AWAY AGAIN THEN PAPA AND MY BROTHERS WILL COME HOME AND I SHALL CALL THE COCKLE SHELLS PAPA
SQUIRE TOOK HER TOWARD THE LITTLE BROOK THAT WANDERED THROUGH THE MEADOWS FLOWING OVER THE PEBBLES WITH A SOFT GURGLING SOUND THAT WAS VERY NEARLY AS SWEET AS MUSIC AND WHEN THEY REACHED IT THE BIG SQUIRE SAID IF YOU WILL LOOK BESIDE THE BROOK
I WANT THEM IN FRONT PERSISTED MARY FOR THE SUN SHINES STRONGER THERE VERY WELL ANSWERED HER MOTHER MAKE YOUR GARDEN AT THE FRONT IF YOU WILL
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT LAST IN THE PASSAGE BEHIND THE HIGHEST BENCH
SOMEBODY GAVE ME A PUSH THAT HAS HURT IT I AM AFRAID NO INDEED IT LOOKS VERY NICE BUT
AND DROWN HER IN TEARS FOR THE LAST DAY OR TWO OF THEIR BEING TOGETHER AND ADVICE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND APPLICABLE NATURE MUST OF COURSE FLOW FROM HER WISE LIPS IN THEIR PARTING CONFERENCE IN HER CLOSET
NOR ONE LUCKY OVERTURN TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THE HERO NOTHING MORE ALARMING OCCURRED THAN A FEAR ON MISSUS ALLEN'S SIDE OF HAVING ONCE LEFT HER CLOGS BEHIND HER AT AN INN
I WISH WE HAD ANY IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY TO GO TO VERY TRUE MY DEAR AND IF WE KNEW ANYBODY WE WOULD JOIN THEM DIRECTLY THE SKINNERS WERE HERE LAST YEAR I WISH THEY WERE HERE NOW
GARDENS ARE ALL WELL ENOUGH FOR FANCY FLOWERS TO GROW IN BUT THE POSIES THAT GOD GAVE TO ALL THE WORLD AND MADE TO GROW WILD IN THE GREAT GARDEN OF NATURE
THE DINGLE BELL I NOW MUST TELL I VE NAMED FOR BROTHER HOBART AND WHEN THE FLOWERS HAVE LIVED THEIR LIVES IN SUNSHINE AND IN RAIN AND THEN DO FADE WHY PAPA SAID
AND NOW WAS THE TIME FOR A HEROINE WHO HAD NOT YET PLAYED A VERY DISTINGUISHED PART IN THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING TO BE NOTICED AND ADMIRED EVERY FIVE MINUTES BY REMOVING SOME OF THE CROWD GAVE GREATER OPENINGS FOR HER CHARMS
AND HENCE MISS MORLAND HAD A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF ALL THE COMPANY BENEATH HER AND OF ALL THE DANGERS OF HER LATE PASSAGE THROUGH THEM IT WAS A SPLENDID SIGHT AND SHE BEGAN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT EVENING
HERE ARE NO TEA THINGS FOR US YOU SEE NO MORE THERE ARE INDEED HOW VERY PROVOKING
I DON'T UPON MY WORD I WISH I DID I WISH I HAD A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE HERE WITH ALL MY HEART AND THEN I SHOULD GET YOU A PARTNER
AND IN THE END SHE PLANTED THE DINGLE BELLS ALL IN ONE STRAIGHT ROW AND THE COCKLE SHELLS IN ANOTHER STRAIGHT ROW THE LENGTH OF THE BED AND SHE FINISHED BY PLANTING THE COWSLIPS IN ANOTHER LONG ROW AT THE BACK HER MOTHER SMILED BUT SAID NOTHING
NO ACQUAINTANCE TO CLAIM NO GENTLEMAN TO ASSIST THEM THEY SAW NOTHING OF MISTER ALLEN AND AFTER LOOKING ABOUT THEM IN VAIN FOR A MORE ELIGIBLE SITUATION WERE OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN AT THE END OF A TABLE
SAID MARY FOR THIS IS TO BE MY OWN LITTLE FLOWER GARDEN AND I WANT TO DO ALL THE WORK MYSELF NOW I MUST TELL YOU THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL ALTHOUGH VERY SWEET IN MANY WAYS HAD ONE SERIOUS FAULT
AND DO YOU KNOW THE DINGLE BELLS THAT GROW NEAR THE EDGE OF THE WOOD HE ASKED AGAIN I KNOW THEM WELL PAPA
COULD NOT TAKE PLACE TILL AFTER THREE OR FOUR DAYS HAD BEEN SPENT IN LEARNING WHAT WAS MOSTLY WORN AND HER CHAPERONE WAS PROVIDED WITH A DRESS OF THE NEWEST FASHION CATHERINE TOO MADE SOME PURCHASES HERSELF
TO HIS GRAY MARE AND RODE AWAY THE VERY NEXT DAY TO MARY'S GREAT SURPRISE AND GRIEF SHE FOUND THE LEAVES OF THE DINGLE BELLS CURLING AND BEGINNING TO WITHER OH MAMMA SHE CALLED COME QUICK
CAUTIONS AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OF SUCH NOBLEMEN AND BARONETS AS DELIGHT IN FORCING YOUNG LADIES AWAY TO SOME REMOTE FARM HOUSE MUST AT SUCH A MOMENT RELIEVE THE FULNESS OF HER HEART WHO WOULD NOT THINK SO
THEIR NAMES WERE HOBART AND ROBART THE LITTLE GIRL'S NAME WAS MARY AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY INDEED WHEN HER FATHER AND HER BROTHERS WERE AT HOME FOR THEY PETTED HER AND PLAYED GAMES WITH HER AND LOVED HER VERY DEARLY
IN WHICH DWELT A SAILOR AND HIS WIFE WITH THEIR TWO STRONG SONS AND A LITTLE GIRL THE SONS WERE ALSO SAILORS AND HAD MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES WITH THEIR FATHER IN A PRETTY SHIP CALLED THE SKYLARK
AND NOW AS THE DAYS PASSED BY MARY WATERED AND TENDED HER GARDEN WITH GREAT CARE AND WHEN THE FLOWERS BEGAN TO SPROUT SHE PLUCKED ALL THE WEEDS THAT GREW AMONG THEM AND SO IN THE MILD SPRING WEATHER THE PLANTS GREW FINELY
THAT THE READER MAY BE ABLE TO JUDGE IN WHAT MANNER HER ACTIONS WILL HEREAFTER TEND TO PROMOTE THE GENERAL DISTRESS OF THE WORK AND HOW SHE WILL PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE POOR CATHERINE TO ALL THE DESPERATE WRETCHEDNESS
OF WHICH A LAST VOLUME IS CAPABLE WHETHER BY HER IMPRUDENCE VULGARITY OR JEALOUSY WHETHER BY INTERCEPTING HER LETTERS RUINING HER CHARACTER OR TURNING HER OUT OF DOORS
REPLIED TO HIM LIKEWISE IN RHYME SAYING I THANK YOU SQUIRE THAT YOU ENQUIRE HOW WELL THE FLOWERS ARE GROWING THE DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ARE BLOWING
JUST AS THE GRASSES BEGAN TO GROW GREEN UPON THE CLIFF AND THE TREES WERE DRESSING THEIR STIFF BARREN BRANCHES IN ROBES OF DELICATE FOLIAGE THE FATHER AND BROTHERS BADE GOOD BYE TO MARY AND HER MOTHER FOR THEY WERE STARTING UPON A VOYAGE TO THE BLACK SEA
BUT MISSUS MORLAND KNEW SO LITTLE OF LORDS AND BARONETS THAT SHE ENTERTAINED NO NOTION OF THEIR GENERAL MISCHIEVOUSNESS AND WAS WHOLLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF DANGER TO HER DAUGHTER FROM THEIR MACHINATIONS
TO FEEL HERSELF AT A BALL SHE LONGED TO DANCE BUT SHE HAD NOT AN ACQUAINTANCE IN THE ROOM MISSUS ALLEN DID ALL THAT SHE COULD DO IN SUCH A CASE BY SAYING VERY PLACIDLY EVERY NOW AND THEN
WHICH WAS THE ONLY TIME THAT ANYBODY SPOKE TO THEM DURING THE EVENING TILL THEY WERE DISCOVERED AND JOINED BY MISTER ALLEN WHEN THE DANCE WAS OVER WELL MISS MORLAND SAID HE DIRECTLY I HOPE YOU HAVE HAD AN AGREEABLE BALL
WE SHALL DO BETTER ANOTHER EVENING I HOPE WAS MISTER ALLEN'S CONSOLATION THE COMPANY BEGAN TO DISPERSE WHEN THE DANCING WAS OVER ENOUGH TO LEAVE SPACE FOR THE REMAINDER TO WALK ABOUT IN SOME COMFORT
THEN GOD WILLING WE SHALL COME BACK TO YOU AND BY THAT TIME YOU MAY HAVE GROWN WISER AND BIGGER AND I AM SURE YOU WILL HAVE GROWN OLDER SO ONE MORE KISS SWEETHEART AND THEN WE MUST GO FOR OUR TIME IS UP
AND WHEN ALL THESE MATTERS WERE ARRANGED THE IMPORTANT EVENING CAME WHICH WAS TO USHER HER INTO THE UPPER ROOMS HER HAIR WAS CUT AND DRESSED BY THE BEST HAND HER CLOTHES PUT ON WITH CARE
AND DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE FLOWERS AND GROW BEST WHERE THEY ARE SHELTERED BY THE WOODS IF YOU HAD PLANTED THEM AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AS I WISHED YOU TO THE WIND WOULD NOT HAVE KILLED THEM MARY DID NOT REPLY TO THIS
MAKE EIGHTEEN BOWS AND DROP INTO THEIR EIGHTEEN PLACES OF OBSCURITY WE WILL PROCEED WITH THE HEARING ON WEDNESDAY FORTNIGHT SAYS THE CHANCELLOR FOR THE QUESTION AT ISSUE IS ONLY A QUESTION OF COSTS
THIS SCARECROW OF A SUIT HAS IN COURSE OF TIME BECOME SO COMPLICATED THAT NO MAN ALIVE KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS THE PARTIES TO IT UNDERSTAND IT LEAST BUT IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT NO TWO CHANCERY LAWYERS
SCORES OF PERSONS HAVE DELIRIOUSLY FOUND THEMSELVES MADE PARTIES IN JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE WITHOUT KNOWING HOW OR WHY WHOLE FAMILIES HAVE INHERITED LEGENDARY HATREDS WITH THE SUIT
OF SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION IS GIVEN I DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO ADD TO THESE NOTABLE FACTS AND THAT GENERAL REFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES WHICH WILL BE FOUND AT PAGE
OR I SHOULD HAVE RESTORED IT
ON SUCH AN AFTERNOON SOME SCORE OF MEMBERS OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY BAR OUGHT TO BE AS HERE THEY ARE MISTILY ENGAGED IN ONE OF THE TEN THOUSAND STAGES OF AN ENDLESS CAUSE
AT THE VERY HEART OF THE FOG SITS THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR IN HIS HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY NEVER CAN THERE COME FOG TOO THICK NEVER CAN THERE COME MUD AND MIRE TOO DEEP
WHERE HER LADYSHIP INTENDS TO STAY SOME WEEKS AFTER WHICH HER MOVEMENTS ARE UNCERTAIN THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE SAYS SO
WHICH SO EXHAUSTS FINANCES PATIENCE COURAGE HOPE SO OVERTHROWS THE BRAIN AND BREAKS THE HEART THAT THERE IS NOT AN HONOURABLE MAN AMONG ITS PRACTITIONERS WHO WOULD NOT GIVE WHO DOES NOT OFTEN GIVE THE WARNING
IT IS NOT SO UNLIKE THE COURT OF CHANCERY BUT THAT WE MAY PASS FROM THE ONE SCENE TO THE OTHER AS THE CROW FLIES BOTH THE WORLD OF FASHION AND THE COURT OF CHANCERY
WHICH HAS ITS RUINED SUITOR WITH HIS SLIPSHOD HEELS AND THREADBARE DRESS BORROWING AND BEGGING THROUGH THE ROUND OF EVERY MAN'S ACQUAINTANCE WHICH GIVES TO MONIED MIGHT THE MEANS ABUNDANTLY OF WEARYING OUT THE RIGHT
IN HIM INDEED HE MARRIED HER FOR LOVE A WHISPER STILL GOES ABOUT THAT SHE HAD NOT EVEN FAMILY
INTO THE FREEZING MOOD AN EXHAUSTED COMPOSURE A WORN OUT PLACIDITY AN EQUANIMITY OF FATIGUE NOT TO BE RUFFLED BY INTEREST OR SATISFACTION ARE THE TROPHIES OF HER VICTORY
AND THERE IS A GENERAL SMELL AND TASTE AS OF THE ANCIENT DEDLOCKS IN THEIR GRAVES MY LADY DEDLOCK WHO IS CHILDLESS LOOKING OUT IN THE EARLY TWILIGHT FROM HER BOUDOIR
AND FOR YEARS NOW MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS BEEN AT THE CENTRE OF THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE AND AT THE TOP OF THE FASHIONABLE TREE HOW ALEXANDER WEPT WHEN HE HAD NO MORE WORLDS TO CONQUER
TO MAKE A PERSONAL APPLICATION TO PURGE HIMSELF OF HIS CONTEMPT WHICH BEING A SOLITARY SURVIVING EXECUTOR WHO HAS FALLEN INTO A STATE OF CONGLOMERATION ABOUT ACCOUNTS OF WHICH IT IS NOT PRETENDED THAT HE HAD EVER ANY KNOWLEDGE
THE APPEARANCES BEYOND ALL RATIONAL DOUBT OBSERVED IN THAT CASE ARE THE APPEARANCES OBSERVED IN MISTER KROOK'S CASE THE NEXT MOST FAMOUS
THE OLD GENTLEMAN IS RUSTY TO LOOK AT BUT IS REPUTED TO HAVE MADE GOOD THRIFT OUT OF ARISTOCRATIC MARRIAGE SETTLEMENTS AND ARISTOCRATIC WILLS AND TO BE VERY RICH
AND LOSING THEIR FOOT HOLD AT STREET CORNERS WHERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER FOOT PASSENGERS HAVE BEEN SLIPPING AND SLIDING SINCE THE DAY BROKE IF THIS DAY EVER BROKE ADDING NEW DEPOSITS TO THE CRUST
AND ADMIT NO LIGHT OF DAY INTO THE PLACE WELL MAY THE UNINITIATED FROM THE STREETS WHO PEEP IN THROUGH THE GLASS PANES IN THE DOOR BE DETERRED FROM ENTRANCE BY ITS OWLISH ASPECT
CHIZZLE MIZZLE AND OTHERWISE HAVE LAPSED INTO A HABIT OF VAGUELY PROMISING THEMSELVES THAT THEY WILL LOOK INTO THAT OUTSTANDING LITTLE MATTER AND SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR DRIZZLE WHO WAS NOT WELL USED
SIX YEARS EARLIER AND THE HISTORIAN IN THAT CASE IS LE CAT
EIGHTEEN OF MISTER TANGLE'S LEARNED FRIENDS EACH ARMED WITH A LITTLE SUMMARY OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SHEETS
WHO ARE NEVER IN ANY CAUSE AND THE WELL OF SOLICITORS BEFORE MENTIONED THERE IS THE REGISTRAR BELOW THE JUDGE IN WIG AND GOWN AND THERE ARE TWO OR THREE MACES OR PETTY BAGS OR PRIVY PURSES
AND ALWAYS EXPECTING SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE JUDGMENT TO BE GIVEN IN HER FAVOUR
I COULD RAIN THEM ON THESE PAGES TO THE SHAME OF A PARSIMONIOUS PUBLIC THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER POINT ON WHICH I OFFER A WORD OF REMARK
TO ASSORT WITH THE GROPING AND FLOUNDERING CONDITION WHICH THIS HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY MOST PESTILENT OF HOARY SINNERS HOLDS THIS DAY IN THE SIGHT OF HEAVEN AND EARTH ON SUCH AN AFTERNOON IF EVER
A SALLOW PRISONER HAS COME UP IN CUSTODY
MICHAELMAS TERM LATELY OVER AND THE LORD CHANCELLOR SITTING IN LINCOLN'S INN HALL IMPLACABLE NOVEMBER WEATHER AS MUCH MUD IN THE STREETS AS IF THE WATERS HAD BUT NEWLY RETIRED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH
IT IS BUT A GLIMPSE OF THE WORLD OF FASHION
I WILL SEE THEM AND SATISFY MYSELF AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF MAKING THE ORDER FOR THEIR RESIDING WITH THEIR UNCLE MISTER TANGLE ON HIS LEGS AGAIN BEGLUDSHIP'S PARDON DEAD WITH THEIR
FOR HALF A MILE IN BREADTH IS A STAGNANT RIVER WITH MELANCHOLY TREES FOR ISLANDS IN IT AND A SURFACE PUNCTURED ALL OVER ALL DAY LONG WITH FALLING RAIN
NEAR THAT LEADEN HEADED OLD OBSTRUCTION APPROPRIATE ORNAMENT FOR THE THRESHOLD OF A LEADEN HEADED OLD CORPORATION TEMPLE BAR AND HARD BY TEMPLE BAR IN LINCOLN'S INN HALL
WITH ONE OR OTHER OF WHOM I THINK IT MUST HAVE ORIGINATED IN SUCH MOUTHS I MIGHT HAVE COUPLED IT WITH AN APT QUOTATION FROM ONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS MY NATURE IS SUBDUED
WHO SAID THAT SUCH A THING MIGHT HAPPEN WHEN THE SKY RAINED POTATOES HE OBSERVED OR WHEN WE GET THROUGH JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE MISTER BLOWERS A PLEASANTRY THAT PARTICULARLY TICKLED THE MACES BAGS AND PURSES
HE WOULD ON THE WHOLE ADMIT NATURE TO BE A GOOD IDEA A LITTLE LOW PERHAPS WHEN NOT ENCLOSED WITH A PARK FENCE BUT AN IDEA DEPENDENT FOR ITS EXECUTION
HE IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY EVER TO DO IN THE MEANTIME HIS PROSPECTS IN LIFE ARE ENDED ANOTHER RUINED SUITOR WHO PERIODICALLY APPEARS FROM SHROPSHIRE AND BREAKS OUT INTO EFFORTS
MY LORD BUT THE CHANCELLOR BEING AWARE OF HIM HAS DEXTEROUSLY VANISHED EVERYBODY ELSE QUICKLY VANISHES TOO
WELL MAY THE COURT BE DIM WITH WASTING CANDLES HERE AND THERE WELL MAY THE FOG HANG HEAVY IN IT AS IF IT WOULD NEVER GET OUT WELL MAY THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS
JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE HAS PASSED INTO A JOKE
UPON CRUST OF MUD STICKING AT THOSE POINTS TENACIOUSLY TO THE PAVEMENT AND ACCUMULATING AT COMPOUND INTEREST FOG EVERYWHERE FOG UP THE RIVER WHERE IT FLOWS AMONG GREEN
TO ADDRESS THE CHANCELLOR AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY'S BUSINESS AND WHO CAN BY NO MEANS BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS LEGALLY IGNORANT OF HIS EXISTENCE AFTER MAKING IT DESOLATE
SMOKE LOWERING DOWN FROM CHIMNEY POTS MAKING A SOFT BLACK DRIZZLE WITH FLAKES OF SOOT IN IT AS BIG AS FULL GROWN SNOWFLAKES GONE INTO MOURNING ONE MIGHT IMAGINE FOR THE DEATH OF THE SUN
AND IT KNOWS ALL FASHIONABLE THINGS TO KNOW THINGS OTHERWISE WERE TO BE UNFASHIONABLE MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS BEEN DOWN AT WHAT SHE CALLS IN FAMILIAR CONVERSATION
I HAVE NO NEED TO OBSERVE THAT I DO NOT WILFULLY OR NEGLIGENTLY MISLEAD MY READERS AND THAT BEFORE I WROTE THAT DESCRIPTION I TOOK PAINS TO INVESTIGATE THE SUBJECT
ARTICLED CLERKS HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF FLESHING THEIR LEGAL WIT UPON IT THE LAST LORD CHANCELLOR HANDLED IT NEATLY
AND IF IT BE NOT IN ITS HEYDAY IT IS NOT YET IN ITS AUTUMN SHE HAS A FINE FACE ORIGINALLY OF A CHARACTER THAT WOULD BE RATHER CALLED VERY PRETTY THAN HANDSOME
FAIR WARDS OF COURT HAVE FADED INTO MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS A LONG PROCESSION OF CHANCELLORS HAS COME IN AND GONE OUT THE LEGION OF BILLS IN THE SUIT HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO MERE BILLS OF MORTALITY
AND ITS SMOKE MOVES IN A TARDY LITTLE CLOUD TOWARDS THE GREEN RISE COPPICE TOPPED THAT MAKES A BACKGROUND FOR THE FALLING RAIN THE VIEW FROM MY LADY DEDLOCK'S OWN WINDOWS
AS THE HOUSEKEEPER HAS PASSED ALONG THE OLD ROOMS SHUTTING UP THE SHUTTERS AND WHEN THEY WILL NEXT COME FORTH AGAIN THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE WHICH LIKE THE FIEND
SAYS THE CHANCELLOR ANEW AND SATISFY MYSELF ON THE SUBJECT OF THEIR RESIDING WITH THEIR COUSIN
WHAT HAS BEEN DOING AND STILL IS DOING IN THIS CONNEXION I MENTION HERE THAT EVERYTHING SET FORTH IN THESE PAGES CONCERNING THE COURT OF CHANCERY IS SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE
IN WHAT EXACT REMOVE HE IS A COUSIN BUT HE IS A COUSIN LEAVING THIS ADDRESS
TRIPPING ONE ANOTHER UP ON SLIPPERY PRECEDENTS GROPING KNEE DEEP IN TECHNICALITIES RUNNING THEIR GOAT HAIR AND HORSEHAIR WARDED HEADS AGAINST WALLS OF WORDS AND MAKING A PRETENCE OF EQUITY
BY GIUSEPPE BIANCHINI A PREBENDARY OF VERONA OTHERWISE DISTINGUISHED IN LETTERS WHO PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF IT AT VERONA IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WHICH HE AFTERWARDS REPUBLISHED AT ROME
TO WHAT IT WORKS IN LIKE THE DYER'S HAND PITY ME THEN AND WISH I WERE RENEWED BUT AS IT IS WHOLESOME THAT THE PARSIMONIOUS PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW
WHO HAS THE HONOUR OF ACTING AS LEGAL ADVISER OF THE DEDLOCKS AND HAS AS MANY CAST IRON BOXES IN HIS OFFICE WITH THAT NAME OUTSIDE AS IF THE PRESENT BARONET WERE THE COIN OF THE CONJUROR'S TRICK
BUT NO ONE KNOWS FOR CERTAIN BECAUSE NO ONE CARES SHE CARRIES SOME SMALL LITTER IN A RETICULE WHICH SHE CALLS HER DOCUMENTS PRINCIPALLY CONSISTING OF PAPER MATCHES AND DRY LAVENDER
HOTLY PURSUED BY THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE TO PASS A FEW DAYS AT HER HOUSE IN TOWN PREVIOUS TO HER DEPARTURE FOR PARIS WHERE HER LADYSHIP INTENDS TO STAY SOME WEEKS AFTER WHICH
MY LADY DEDLOCK'S PLACE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DREARY THE WEATHER FOR MANY A DAY AND NIGHT HAS BEEN SO WET THAT THE TREES SEEM WET THROUGH
IT HAS BEEN DEATH TO MANY BUT IT IS A JOKE IN THE PROFESSION EVERY MASTER IN CHANCERY HAS HAD A REFERENCE OUT OF IT EVERY CHANCELLOR WAS IN IT FOR SOMEBODY OR OTHER WHEN HE WAS COUNSEL AT THE BAR
AND AT HER HOUSE IN TOWN UPON THIS MUDDY MURKY AFTERNOON PRESENTS HIMSELF AN OLD FASHIONED OLD GENTLEMAN ATTORNEY AT LAW AND EKE SOLICITOR OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY
FAIRY LAND TO VISIT BUT A DESERT TO LIVE IN THE OLD GENTLEMAN IS CONDUCTED BY A MERCURY IN POWDER TO MY LADY'S PRESENCE
HIS FAMILY IS AS OLD AS THE HILLS AND INFINITELY MORE RESPECTABLE HE HAS A GENERAL OPINION THAT THE WORLD MIGHT GET ON WITHOUT HILLS BUT WOULD BE DONE UP WITHOUT DEDLOCKS
IT IS A DEADENED WORLD AND ITS GROWTH IS SOMETIMES UNHEALTHY FOR WANT OF AIR MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS RETURNED TO HER HOUSE IN TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS PREVIOUS TO HER DEPARTURE FOR PARIS
AND HOLDS HER PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS IN THE HIGHEST ESTIMATION HIS GALLANTRY TO MY LADY WHICH HAS NEVER CHANGED SINCE HE COURTED HER
AND THE SOFT LOPPINGS AND PRUNINGS OF THE WOODMAN'S AXE CAN MAKE NO CRASH OR CRACKLE AS THEY FALL THE DEER LOOKING SOAKED LEAVE QUAGMIRES WHERE THEY PASS
MAY HAVE GOT AN EXTRA MORAL TWIST AND SHUFFLE INTO THEMSELVES OUT OF JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE THE RECEIVER IN THE CAUSE HAS ACQUIRED A GOODLY SUM OF MONEY BY IT BUT HAS ACQUIRED TOO A DISTRUST OF HIS OWN MOTHER
SINCE OLD TOM JARNDYCE IN DESPAIR BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT AT A COFFEE HOUSE IN CHANCERY LANE BUT JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE STILL DRAGS ITS DREARY LENGTH BEFORE THE COURT PERENNIALLY HOPELESS
TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BY ALL AUTHORITIES PUBLISHED SOME INGENIOUS LETTERS TO ME AT THE TIME WHEN THAT EVENT WAS CHRONICLED ARGUING THAT SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE
AT WHICH POINT I THOUGHT THE JUDGE'S EYE HAD A CAST IN MY DIRECTION WAS ALMOST IMMACULATE THERE HAD BEEN HE ADMITTED A TRIVIAL BLEMISH OR SO IN ITS RATE OF PROGRESS
AND ARE COME TO THE BRINK OF THE VOID BEYOND IT IS A VERY LITTLE SPECK THERE IS MUCH GOOD IN IT THERE ARE MANY GOOD AND TRUE PEOPLE IN IT IT HAS ITS APPOINTED PLACE BUT THE EVIL OF IT IS
RINGING IN THE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF THE VERY LITTLE COUNSEL DROPS AND THE FOG KNOWS HIM NO MORE EVERYBODY LOOKS FOR HIM NOBODY CAN SEE HIM I WILL SPEAK WITH BOTH THE YOUNG PEOPLE
AS ONE OF A COMPANY OF SOME HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN AND WOMEN NOT LABOURING UNDER ANY SUSPICIONS OF LUNACY THAT THE COURT OF CHANCERY THOUGH THE SHINING SUBJECT OF MUCH POPULAR PREJUDICE
A MERE BUD ON THE FOREST TREE OF THE PARENT SUIT AND REALLY WILL COME TO A SETTLEMENT ONE OF THESE DAYS THE CHANCELLOR RISES THE BAR RISES THE PRISONER IS BROUGHT
THE CHANCELLOR IS ABOUT TO BOW TO THE BAR WHEN THE PRISONER IS PRESENTED NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY COME OF THE PRISONER'S CONGLOMERATION BUT HIS BEING SENT BACK TO PRISON WHICH IS SOON DONE
NOT YET DECIDED WHICH WAS COMMENCED BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY AND IN WHICH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SEVENTY THOUSAND POUNDS HAS BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN COSTS IF I WANTED OTHER AUTHORITIES FOR JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE
BUT THIS WAS EXAGGERATED AND HAD BEEN ENTIRELY OWING TO THE PARSIMONY OF THE PUBLIC WHICH GUILTY PUBLIC IT APPEARED HAD BEEN UNTIL LATELY BENT IN THE MOST DETERMINED MANNER
DOWN IN HIS CLOSE CABIN FOG CRUELLY PINCHING THE TOES AND FINGERS OF HIS SHIVERING LITTLE PRENTICE BOY ON DECK
TO THE YOUNG GIRL AND BOY THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE MISTER TANGLE CRUSHED WHOM I DIRECTED TO BE IN ATTENDANCE TO DAY AND WHO ARE NOW IN MY PRIVATE ROOM
THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT IS CALLED SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION HAS BEEN DENIED SINCE THE DEATH OF MISTER KROOK AND MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER LEWES
OR WHATEVER THEY MAY BE IN LEGAL COURT SUITS THESE ARE ALL YAWNING FOR NO CRUMB OF AMUSEMENT EVER FALLS FROM JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE THE CAUSE IN HAND
GAS LOOMING THROUGH THE FOG IN DIVERS PLACES IN THE STREETS MUCH AS THE SUN MAY FROM THE SPONGEY FIELDS BE SEEN TO LOOM BY HUSBANDMAN AND PLOUGHBOY
ON BY NO MEANS ENLARGING THE NUMBER OF CHANCERY JUDGES APPOINTED I BELIEVE BY RICHARD THE SECOND BUT ANY OTHER KING WILL DO AS WELL THIS SEEMED TO ME TOO PROFOUND A JOKE TO BE INSERTED IN THE BODY OF THIS BOOK
THIS IS THE COURT OF CHANCERY WHICH HAS ITS DECAYING HOUSES AND ITS BLIGHTED LANDS IN EVERY SHIRE WHICH HAS ITS WORN OUT LUNATIC IN EVERY MADHOUSE AND ITS DEAD IN EVERY CHURCHYARD
BY A LARGE ADVOCATE WITH GREAT WHISKERS A LITTLE VOICE AND AN INTERMINABLE BRIEF AND OUTWARDLY DIRECTING HIS CONTEMPLATION TO THE LANTERN IN THE ROOF WHERE HE CAN SEE NOTHING BUT FOG
HOW MANY PEOPLE OUT OF THE SUIT JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE HAS STRETCHED FORTH ITS UNWHOLESOME HAND TO SPOIL AND CORRUPT WOULD BE A VERY WIDE QUESTION FROM THE MASTER
HER PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE THE WATERS ARE OUT IN LINCOLNSHIRE AN ARCH OF THE BRIDGE IN THE PARK HAS BEEN SAPPED AND SOPPED AWAY THE ADJACENT LOW LYING GROUND
SHE IS PERFECTLY WELL BRED IF SHE COULD BE TRANSLATED TO HEAVEN TO MORROW SHE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO ASCEND WITHOUT ANY RAPTURE SHE HAS BEAUTY STILL
THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OUGHT TO BE SITTING HERE AS HERE HE IS WITH A FOGGY GLORY ROUND HIS HEAD SOFTLY FENCED IN WITH CRIMSON CLOTH AND CURTAINS ADDRESSED
AND BY THE DRAWL LANGUIDLY ECHOING TO THE ROOF FROM THE PADDED DAIS WHERE THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR LOOKS INTO THE LANTERN THAT HAS NO LIGHT IN IT AND WHERE THE ATTENDANT WIGS ARE ALL STUCK IN A FOG BANK
FOG IN THE EYES AND THROATS OF ANCIENT GREENWICH PENSIONERS WHEEZING BY THE FIRESIDES OF THEIR WARDS FOG IN THE STEM AND BOWL OF THE AFTERNOON PIPE OF THE WRATHFUL SKIPPER
UPON THE BROAD FLAGGED PAVEMENT CALLED FROM OLD TIME THE GHOST'S WALK ALL NIGHT ON SUNDAYS THE LITTLE CHURCH IN THE PARK IS MOULDY
SIR LEICESTER IS TWENTY YEARS FULL MEASURE OLDER THAN MY LADY HE WILL NEVER SEE SIXTY FIVE AGAIN NOR PERHAPS SIXTY SIX NOR YET SIXTY SEVEN
LUDSHIP IS THE REPLY THAT SLIDES OUT OF MISTER TANGLE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE BAR ARE STILL TO BE HEARD I BELIEVE SAYS THE CHANCELLOR WITH A SLIGHT SMILE
UPON WHOSE IMPALING FILES REAMS OF DUSTY WARRANTS
EVERYBODY KNOWS OR HAS SOME REASON TO KNOW BY THIS TIME THE MATTER HAVING BEEN RATHER FREQUENTLY MENTIONED MY LADY DEDLOCK HAVING CONQUERED HER WORLD FELL NOT INTO THE MELTING BUT RATHER
HE IS SURROUNDED BY A MYSTERIOUS HALO OF FAMILY CONFIDENCES OF WHICH HE IS KNOWN TO BE THE SILENT DEPOSITORY
STILL ON JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE TO THE YOUNG GIRL BEGLUDSHIP'S PARDON BOY SAYS MISTER TANGLE PREMATURELY
AND IT WOULD NOT BE WONDERFUL TO MEET A MEGALOSAURUS FORTY FEET LONG OR SO
WITH SERIOUS FACES AS PLAYERS MIGHT ON SUCH AN AFTERNOON THE VARIOUS SOLICITORS IN THE CAUSE SOME TWO OR THREE OF WHOM HAVE INHERITED IT FROM THEIR FATHERS
MISTER TANGLE SAYS THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR LATTERLY SOMETHING RESTLESS UNDER THE ELOQUENCE OF THAT LEARNED GENTLEMAN MLUD SAYS MISTER TANGLE MISTER TANGLE KNOWS MORE OF JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE THAN ANYBODY
A FEW LAWYERS CLERKS AND OTHERS WHO KNOW THIS SUITOR BY SIGHT LINGER ON THE CHANCE OF HIS FURNISHING SOME FUN AND ENLIVENING THE DISMAL WEATHER A LITTLE JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE DRONES ON
AND REMARKS IN COMMENDATION OF HER HAIR ESPECIALLY THAT SHE IS THE BEST GROOMED WOMAN IN THE WHOLE STUD WITH ALL HER PERFECTIONS ON HER HEAD MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS COME UP FROM HER PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE
FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY PLANTS HIMSELF IN A GOOD PLACE AND KEEPS AN EYE ON THE JUDGE READY TO CALL OUT MY LORD IN A VOICE OF SONOROUS COMPLAINT ON THE INSTANT OF HIS RISING
CAN TALK ABOUT IT FOR FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT COMING TO A TOTAL DISAGREEMENT AS TO ALL THE PREMISES INNUMERABLE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN BORN INTO THE CAUSE INNUMERABLE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE MARRIED INTO IT INNUMERABLE OLD PEOPLE HAVE DIED OUT OF IT
HE HAS A TWIST OF THE GOUT NOW AND THEN AND WALKS A LITTLE STIFFLY HE IS OF A WORTHY PRESENCE WITH HIS LIGHT GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS HIS FINE SHIRT FRILL
RATHER THAN GIVE OCCASION FOR THE LEAST IMPEACHMENT OF HIS INTEGRITY HE IS AN HONOURABLE OBSTINATE TRUTHFUL HIGH SPIRITED INTENSELY PREJUDICED PERFECTLY UNREASONABLE MAN
ON YOUR GREAT COUNTY FAMILIES HE IS A GENTLEMAN OF STRICT CONSCIENCE DISDAINFUL OF ALL LITTLENESS AND MEANNESS AND READY ON THE SHORTEST NOTICE TO DIE ANY DEATH YOU MAY PLEASE TO MENTION
BUT IMPROVED INTO CLASSICALITY BY THE ACQUIRED EXPRESSION OF HER FASHIONABLE STATE HER FIGURE IS ELEGANT AND HAS THE EFFECT OF BEING TALL NOT THAT SHE IS SO BUT THAT
THE SHORT HAND WRITERS THE REPORTERS OF THE COURT AND THE REPORTERS OF THE NEWSPAPERS INVARIABLY DECAMP WITH THE REST OF THE REGULARS WHEN JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE COMES ON THEIR PLACES ARE A BLANK
THE MAN FROM SHROPSHIRE CRIES MY LORD MACES BAGS AND PURSES INDIGNANTLY PROCLAIM SILENCE AND FROWN AT THE MAN FROM SHROPSHIRE IN REFERENCE PROCEEDS THE CHANCELLOR
SUFFER ANY WRONG THAT CAN BE DONE YOU RATHER THAN COME HERE WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN THE LORD CHANCELLOR'S COURT THIS MURKY AFTERNOON BESIDES THE LORD CHANCELLOR THE COUNSEL IN THE CAUSE TWO OR THREE COUNSEL
IT WAS IN SOME OFF HAND MANNER NEVER MEANT TO GO RIGHT THUS IN THE MIDST OF THE MUD AND AT THE HEART OF THE FOG SITS THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR IN HIS HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY
WILL BE INFLUENCED AND MATERIALLY INFLUENCED BY THE MERE SILENT PRESENCE OF SOME EXTERNAL OBJECT WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN NEAR US WHEN WE CLOSED OUR EYES AND OF WHOSE VICINITY WE HAVE HAD NO WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS
OR HOW COULD SHE POSTPONE THE JOURNEY WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION MISTER LOSBERNE WAS WITH THEM AND WOULD BE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS BUT ROSE WAS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXCELLENT GENTLEMAN'S IMPETUOSITY AND FORESAW TOO CLEARLY THE WRATH WITH WHICH
AND READILY UNDERTOOK TO HOLD SOLEMN CONFERENCE WITH THE WORTHY DOCTOR HIMSELF TO AFFORD HIM AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THIS DESIGN IT WAS ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD CALL AT THE HOTEL AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT EVENING AND THAT IN THE MEANTIME
AND IT WAS LATE BEFORE THEY RETIRED WITH LIGHT AND THANKFUL HEARTS TO TAKE THAT REST OF WHICH AFTER THE DOUBT AND SUSPENSE THEY HAD RECENTLY UNDERGONE THEY STOOD MUCH IN NEED OLIVER ROSE NEXT MORNING IN BETTER HEART
DO YOU STILL SUPPOSE THAT I AM A BOY IGNORANT OF MY OWN MIND AND MISTAKING THE IMPULSES OF MY OWN SOUL I THINK MY DEAR SON RETURNED MISSUS MAYLIE LAYING HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
HAS ALWAYS BEEN HER CHARACTERISTIC WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT I LEAVE YOU TO DISCOVER REPLIED MISSUS MAYLIE I MUST GO BACK TO HER GOD BLESS YOU I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT SAID THE YOUNG MAN EAGERLY
MISSUS MAYLIE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUSLY INFORMED OF ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED THESE PRELIMINARIES ADJUSTED ROSE AND OLIVER RETURNED HOME ROSE HAD BY NO MEANS OVERRATED THE MEASURE OF THE GOOD DOCTOR'S WRATH NANCY'S HISTORY WAS NO SOONER UNFOLDED TO HIM
THIS IS GREAT HAPPINESS TO ME GREAT HAPPINESS BUT YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHERE HE IS NOW MISS MAYLIE YOU MUST PARDON MY FINDING FAULT WITH YOU
THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY STRATAGEM AND BY CATCHING HIM WHEN HE IS NOT SURROUNDED BY THESE PEOPLE FOR SUPPOSE HE WERE APPREHENDED WE HAVE NO PROOF AGAINST HIM HE IS NOT EVEN SO FAR AS WE KNOW OR AS THE FACTS APPEAR TO US
YET LEFT HER CHAMBER AND THERE WERE NO EVENING WALKS SAVE NOW AND THEN FOR A SHORT DISTANCE WITH MISSUS MAYLIE HE APPLIED HIMSELF WITH REDOUBLED ASSIDUITY TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE WHITE HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN AND LABOURED SO HARD THAT HIS QUICK PROGRESS SURPRISED EVEN HIMSELF
IF IT BE PAINFUL TO HIM SHE THOUGHT TO COME BACK HERE HOW PAINFUL IT WILL BE TO ME BUT PERHAPS HE WILL NOT COME HE MAY WRITE OR HE MAY COME HIMSELF AND STUDIOUSLY ABSTAIN FROM MEETING ME HE DID WHEN HE WENT AWAY
MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN IMPATIENTLY HE WOULD BE A SELFISH BRUTE UNWORTHY ALIKE OF THE NAME OF MAN AND OF THE WOMAN YOU DESCRIBE WHO ACTED THUS YOU THINK SO NOW HARRY REPLIED HIS MOTHER AND EVER WILL SAID THE YOUNG MAN
CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER IT WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH HAPPINESS TO BEAR
WILL HAVE BEGUN TO THINK BY THIS TIME THAT WE HAVE WEARIED OF HIS COMPANY AND ENTERED INTO SOME DARK CONSPIRACY TO THRUST HIM FORTH UPON THE WORLD
WHICH WAS QUITE AS CONSOLATORY AND FULL OF PROMISE AS OLIVER'S STATEMENT HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE AND TO THE WHOLE OF WHICH MISTER GILES WHO AFFECTED TO BE BUSY ABOUT THE LUGGAGE LISTENED WITH GREEDY EARS
AND DOUBTLESS HE WOULD IN THIS FIRST OUTBREAK HAVE CARRIED THE INTENTION INTO EFFECT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF HE HAD NOT BEEN RESTRAINED IN PART BY CORRESPONDING VIOLENCE ON THE SIDE OF MISTER BROWNLOW
INDEED SAID MISTER BROWNLOW OLIVER TWIST YOU KNEW HIM AS REPLIED ROSE THE WORDS NO SOONER ESCAPED HER LIPS
QUICK SHE SAID TELL THEM TO FETCH A HACKNEY COACH AND BE READY TO GO WITH ME I WILL TAKE YOU THERE DIRECTLY WITHOUT A MINUTE'S LOSS OF TIME I WILL ONLY TELL MY AUNT THAT WE ARE GOING OUT FOR AN HOUR AND BE READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE
THE MELANCHOLY WHICH HAD SEEMED TO THE SAD EYES OF THE ANXIOUS BOY TO HANG FOR DAYS PAST OVER EVERY OBJECT BEAUTIFUL AS ALL WERE WAS DISPELLED BY MAGIC THE DEW SEEMED TO SPARKLE MORE BRIGHTLY ON THE GREEN LEAVES THE AIR TO RUSTLE AMONG THEM WITH A SWEETER MUSIC
CONCERNED WITH THE GANG IN ANY OF THEIR ROBBERIES IF HE WERE NOT DISCHARGED IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT HE COULD RECEIVE ANY FURTHER PUNISHMENT THAN BEING COMMITTED TO PRISON AS A ROGUE AND VAGABOND
IN THE FIRST EXPLOSION OF HIS INDIGNATION HE WOULD REGARD THE INSTRUMENT OF OLIVER'S RECAPTURE TO TRUST HIM WITH THE SECRET WHEN HER REPRESENTATIONS IN THE GIRL'S BEHALF COULD BE SECONDED BY NO EXPERIENCED PERSON
THEY PURPOSED REMAINING IN LONDON ONLY THREE DAYS PRIOR TO DEPARTING FOR SOME WEEKS TO A DISTANT PART OF THE COAST IT WAS NOW MIDNIGHT OF THE FIRST DAY WHAT COURSE OF ACTION COULD SHE DETERMINE UPON WHICH COULD BE ADOPTED IN EIGHT AND FORTY HOURS
BE SEATED PRAY MISTER BROWNLOW I BELIEVE SIR SAID ROSE GLANCING FROM THE OTHER GENTLEMAN TO THE ONE WHO HAD SPOKEN THAT IS MY NAME SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THIS IS MY FRIEND MISTER GRIMWIG
THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF ANY MISTAKE ON YOUR PART MY BOY IS THERE DEMANDED THE GENTLEMAN IN A TREMULOUS VOICE DO NOT DECEIVE ME BY AWAKENING HOPES THAT ARE NOT TO BE FULFILLED I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD SIR REPLIED OLIVER INDEED YOU MAY BELIEVE ME
AND WHY SHOULD I SUFFER THE PAIN OF A DELAY IN GIVING THEM VENT WHICH CAN BE PRODUCTIVE OF NO EARTHLY GOOD NO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE ROSE SHALL HEAR ME SHE SHALL SAID MISSUS MAYLIE
DON'T BE AFRAID I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR GRANDFATHER YOU'RE A SWEET GIRL I LIKE YOU HERE THEY ARE IN FACT AS HE THREW HIMSELF AT ONE DEXTEROUS DIVE INTO HIS FORMER SEAT MISTER BROWNLOW RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY OLIVER
THE FORMER NOW HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HARRY MAYLIE AND HEARTY SALUTATIONS WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN THEM THE DOCTOR THEN COMMUNICATED IN REPLY TO MULTIFARIOUS QUESTIONS FROM HIS YOUNG FRIEND A PRECISE ACCOUNT OF HIS PATIENT'S SITUATION
GRIMWIG WILL YOU LEAVE US FOR A FEW MINUTES I BELIEVE INTERPOSED MISS MAYLIE THAT AT THIS PERIOD OF OUR INTERVIEW I NEED NOT GIVE THAT GENTLEMAN THE TROUBLE OF GOING AWAY IF I AM CORRECTLY INFORMED
DO ME THE FAVOUR MY DEAR YOUNG LADY TO LEAVE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT GOODNESS AND BENEVOLENCE OF WHICH YOU SPEAK AND OF WHICH NOBODY ELSE KNOWS ANYTHING
THERE IS SOMETHING IN YOUR MANNER WHICH WOULD ALMOST IMPLY THAT SHE WILL HEAR ME COLDLY MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN NOT COLDLY REJOINED THE OLD LADY FAR FROM IT HOW THEN
I KNOW THAT SHE DESERVES THE BEST AND PUREST LOVE THE HEART OF MAN CAN OFFER SAID MISSUS MAYLIE I KNOW THAT THE DEVOTION AND AFFECTION OF HER NATURE REQUIRE NO ORDINARY RETURN BUT ONE THAT SHALL BE DEEP AND LASTING IF I DID NOT FEEL THIS
HER WORDS AND MANNER HAD TOUCHED ROSE MAYLIE'S HEART AND MINGLED WITH HER LOVE FOR HER YOUNG CHARGE AND SCARCELY LESS INTENSE IN ITS TRUTH AND FERVOUR WAS HER FOND WISH TO WIN THE OUTCAST BACK TO REPENTANCE AND HOPE
I'D SEND THEM ONE AND ALL TO NEVER MIND WHERE INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNLOW BUT REFLECT WHETHER SENDING THEM ANYWHERE IS LIKELY TO ATTAIN THE OBJECT WE HAVE IN VIEW WHAT OBJECT ASKED THE DOCTOR
URGED THE YOUNG MAN SHE HAS FORMED NO OTHER ATTACHMENT NO INDEED REPLIED HIS MOTHER YOU HAVE OR I MISTAKE TOO STRONG A HOLD ON HER AFFECTIONS ALREADY WHAT I WOULD SAY RESUMED THE OLD LADY STOPPING HER SON AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK
HE ROSE AND LIMPED AS FAST AS HE COULD UP AND DOWN THE ROOM AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND THEN STOPPING SUDDENLY BEFORE ROSE KISSED HER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST PREFACE HUSH HE SAID AS THE YOUNG LADY ROSE IN SOME ALARM AT THIS UNUSUAL PROCEEDING
AND WHO CAN WONDER IF IT BE SO MOTHER REJOINED THE YOUNG MAN OR WHY SHOULD I SAY IF IT IS IT IS YOU KNOW IT MOTHER YOU MUST KNOW IT
WHETHER HE LIVED THERE AND THEY SAID HE DID LOOK HERE SAID OLIVER OPENING A SCRAP OF PAPER HERE IT IS HERE'S WHERE HE LIVES I'M GOING THERE DIRECTLY OH DEAR ME DEAR ME WHAT SHALL I DO WHEN I COME TO SEE HIM AND
WHO MAY HE BE THAT LADY'S SON AND THIS YOUNG LADY'S VERY OLD FRIEND SAID THE DOCTOR MOTIONING TOWARDS MISSUS MAYLIE AND CONCLUDING WITH AN EXPRESSIVE GLANCE AT HER NIECE
ARE IN THE RIGHT BUT THE SOMBRE COLOURS ARE REFLECTIONS FROM THEIR OWN JAUNDICED EYES AND HEARTS THE REAL HUES ARE DELICATE AND NEED A CLEARER VISION IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK AND OLIVER DID NOT FAIL TO NOTE IT AT THE TIME THAT HIS MORNING EXPEDITIONS WERE NO LONGER MADE ALONE
WITH HER ATTENTION NOT A LITTLE DISTRACTED BY THESE AND A GREAT MANY OTHER INCOHERENT EXCLAMATIONS OF JOY ROSE READ THE ADDRESS WHICH WAS CRAVEN STREET IN THE STRAND SHE VERY SOON DETERMINED UPON TURNING THE DISCOVERY TO ACCOUNT
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW WHAT INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVE OF THIS POOR CHILD ALLOWING ME TO PROMISE THAT I EXHAUSTED EVERY MEANS IN MY POWER OF DISCOVERING HIM AND THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN ABSENT FROM THIS COUNTRY MY FIRST IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD IMPOSED UPON ME
HE SEEMED ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS OF AGE AND WAS OF THE MIDDLE HEIGHT HIS COUNTENANCE WAS FRANK AND HANDSOME AND HIS DEMEANOR EASY AND PREPOSSESSING NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUTH AND AGE
THE TEARS ROSE TO HER EYES AS SHE PURSUED THIS TRAIN OF REFLECTION HE MIGHT HAVE BY THIS TIME LEARNT TO FORGET HER AND TO BE HAPPIER AWAY DISTURBED BY THESE DIFFERENT REFLECTIONS INCLINING NOW TO ONE COURSE AND THEN TO ANOTHER
THAN HE POURED FORTH A SHOWER OF MINGLED THREATS AND EXECRATIONS THREATENED TO MAKE HER THE FIRST VICTIM OF THE COMBINED INGENUITY OF MESSRS BLATHERS AND DUFF AND ACTUALLY PUT ON HIS HAT PREPARATORY TO SALLYING FORTH TO OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF THOSE WORTHIES
WERE THE SCOWLING FEATURES OF THE MAN WHO HAD ACCOSTED HIM IN THE INN YARD
UPSET IT WITH A GREAT CRASH AND FALLING BACK IN HIS CHAIR DISCHARGED FROM HIS FEATURES EVERY EXPRESSION BUT ONE OF UNMITIGATED WONDER AND INDULGED IN A PROLONGED AND VACANT STARE THEN AS IF ASHAMED OF HAVING BETRAYED SO MUCH EMOTION
THAT YOUTH HAS MANY GENEROUS IMPULSES WHICH DO NOT LAST AND THAT AMONG THEM ARE SOME WHICH BEING GRATIFIED BECOME ONLY THE MORE FLEETING ABOVE ALL I THINK SAID THE LADY FIXING HER EYES ON HER SON'S FACE THAT IF AN ENTHUSIASTIC
IN A WORD CRIED THE GENTLEMAN BETTER OR WORSE BETTER MUCH BETTER REPLIED OLIVER HASTILY THANK HEAVEN EXCLAIMED THE GENTLEMAN YOU ARE SURE QUITE SIR REPLIED OLIVER THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE ONLY A FEW HOURS AGO
AND LAID IT DOWN AGAIN FIFTY TIMES AND HAD CONSIDERED AND RECONSIDERED THE FIRST LINE OF HER LETTER WITHOUT WRITING THE FIRST WORD WHEN OLIVER WHO HAD BEEN WALKING IN THE STREETS WITH MISTER GILES FOR A BODY GUARD ENTERED THE ROOM IN SUCH BREATHLESS HASTE AND VIOLENT AGITATION
RUNNING UP TO THE CHAISE DOOR GILES POPPED OUT HIS NIGHTCAP AGAIN PREPARATORY TO MAKING SOME REPLY WHEN HE WAS SUDDENLY PULLED BACK BY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO OCCUPIED THE OTHER CORNER OF THE CHAISE AND WHO EAGERLY DEMANDED WHAT WAS THE NEWS
AND THAT YOUR ARRIVAL HERE A DAY SOONER OR A DAY LATER
NOT TO BE DISCHARGED ON EMPTY AIR BUT TO DIE AWAY IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF HIS STOMACH MISTER BROWLOW WAS NO LESS SURPRISED ALTHOUGH HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT EXPRESSED IN THE SAME ECCENTRIC MANNER HE DREW HIS CHAIR NEARER TO MISS MAYLIE'S AND SAID
SAID THE IMPETUOUS DOCTOR WHEN THEY HAD REJOINED THE TWO LADIES ARE WE TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO ALL THESE VAGABONDS MALE AND FEMALE AND BEG THEM TO ACCEPT A HUNDRED POUNDS OR SO APIECE AS A TRIFLING MARK OF OUR ESTEEM
HE IS COGNIZANT OF THE BUSINESS ON WHICH I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU MISTER BROWNLOW INCLINED HIS HEAD MISTER GRIMWIG WHO HAD MADE ONE VERY STIFF BOW AND RISEN FROM HIS CHAIR MADE ANOTHER VERY STIFF BOW AND DROPPED INTO IT AGAIN
IT WAS WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN THIS PURSUIT THAT HE WAS GREATLY STARTLED AND DISTRESSED BY A MOST UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE THE LITTLE ROOM IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SIT WHEN BUSY AT HIS BOOKS
THIS DONE THE POSTBOY DROVE OFF GILES MISTER MAYLIE AND OLIVER FOLLOWED AT THEIR LEISURE AS THEY WALKED ALONG OLIVER GLANCED FROM TIME TO TIME WITH MUCH INTEREST AND CURIOSITY AT THE NEW COMER
AND MISTER LOSBERNE SAYS THAT ALL DANGER IS AT AN END THE GENTLEMAN SAID NOT ANOTHER WORD BUT OPENING THE CHAISE DOOR LEAPED OUT AND TAKING OLIVER HURRIEDLY BY THE ARM LED HIM ASIDE YOU ARE QUITE CERTAIN
I WOULD RATHER WALK SLOWLY ON SO AS TO GAIN A LITTLE TIME BEFORE I SEE HER YOU CAN SAY I AM COMING I BEG YOUR PARDON MISTER HARRY SAID GILES GIVING A FINAL POLISH TO HIS RUFFLED COUNTENANCE WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF BUT IF YOU WOULD LEAVE THE POSTBOY TO SAY THAT
HE WAS FAIN TO ADMIT THAT NO BETTER COURSE OCCURRED TO HIM JUST THEN AND AS BOTH ROSE AND MISSUS MAYLIE SIDED VERY STRONGLY WITH MISTER BROWNLOW THAT GENTLEMAN'S PROPOSITION WAS CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY I SHOULD LIKE HE SAID
GOD BE GOOD TO ME CRIED THE OLD LADY EMBRACING HIM IT IS MY INNOCENT BOY MY DEAR OLD NURSE CRIED OLIVER HE WOULD COME BACK I KNEW HE WOULD SAID THE OLD LADY HOLDING HIM IN HER ARMS HOW WELL HE LOOKS
AND IN EXACT PROPORTION TO HIS SUCCESS IN THE WORLD BE CAST IN HIS TEETH AND MADE THE SUBJECT OF SNEERS AGAINST HIM HE MAY NO MATTER HOW GENEROUS AND GOOD HIS NATURE
AND AN UTTER INABILITY TO CONTROL OUR THOUGHTS OR POWER OF MOTION CAN BE CALLED SLEEP THIS IS IT AND YET WE HAVE A CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THAT IS GOING ON ABOUT US AND IF WE DREAM AT SUCH A TIME WORDS WHICH ARE REALLY SPOKEN OR SOUNDS WHICH REALLY EXIST AT THE MOMENT
A BURST OF TEARS CAME TO HIS RELIEF AND HE SEEMED TO AWAKEN ALL AT ONCE TO A FULL SENSE OF THE JOYFUL CHANGE THAT HAD OCCURRED AND THE ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE LOAD OF ANGUISH WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIS BREAST THE NIGHT WAS FAST CLOSING IN WHEN HE RETURNED HOMEWARD
THESE WERE ALL REASONS FOR THE GREATEST CAUTION AND MOST CIRCUMSPECT BEHAVIOUR IN COMMUNICATING IT TO MISSUS MAYLIE WHOSE FIRST IMPULSE WOULD INFALLIBLY BE TO HOLD A CONFERENCE WITH THE WORTHY DOCTOR ON THE SUBJECT AS TO RESORTING TO ANY LEGAL ADVISER
AND HE'D UNCOMMONLY LIKE TO SEE ANY MAN OFFER TO DO IT RESPONDED MISTER GRIMWIG KNOCKING HIS STICK UPON THE FLOOR HAVING GONE THUS FAR THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN SEVERALLY TOOK SNUFF
I SHALL SURPRISE YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID ROSE NATURALLY EMBARRASSED BUT YOU ONCE SHOWED GREAT BENEVOLENCE AND GOODNESS TO A VERY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND OF MINE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL TAKE AN INTEREST IN HEARING OF HIM AGAIN
NOR IS THIS THE MOST STRIKING PHENOMENON INCIDENTAL TO SUCH A STATE IT IS AN UNDOUBTED FACT THAT ALTHOUGH OUR SENSES OF TOUCH AND SIGHT BE FOR THE TIME DEAD YET OUR SLEEPING THOUGHTS AND THE VISIONARY SCENES THAT PASS BEFORE US
AND SENDING UP HER CARD BY THE SERVANT REQUESTED TO SEE MISTER BROWNLOW ON VERY PRESSING BUSINESS THE SERVANT SOON RETURNED TO BEG THAT SHE WOULD WALK UPSTAIRS AND FOLLOWING HIM INTO AN UPPER ROOM MISS MAYLIE WAS PRESENTED TO AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN OF BENEVOLENT APPEARANCE
DEAR ME SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE BOTTLE GREEN COAT HASTILY RISING WITH GREAT POLITENESS I BEG YOUR PARDON YOUNG LADY I IMAGINED IT WAS SOME IMPORTUNATE PERSON WHO I BEG YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RINGING THE BELL SEND MISSUS BEDWIN HERE IF YOU PLEASE THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH ALL DISPATCH AND DROPPING A CURTSEY AT THE DOOR WAITED FOR ORDERS WHY YOU GET BLINDER EVERY DAY BEDWIN
TO DEPOSIT IN THE LOCAL SAVINGS BANK THE SUM OF FIVE AND TWENTY POUNDS FOR HIS SOLE USE AND BENEFIT AT THIS THE TWO WOMEN SERVANTS LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS AND EYES AND SUPPOSED THAT MISTER GILES PULLING OUT HIS SHIRT FRILL REPLIED NO NO
EVEN IF SHE HAD KNOWN HOW TO DO SO IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE THOUGHT OF FOR THE SAME REASON ONCE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HER OF SEEKING ASSISTANCE FROM HARRY BUT THIS AWAKENED THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR LAST PARTING AND IT SEEMED UNWORTHY OF HER TO CALL HIM BACK WHEN
AND AFTERWARDS SHOOK HANDS ACCORDING TO THEIR INVARIABLE CUSTOM NOW MISS MAYLIE SAID MISTER BROWNLOW TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT IN WHICH YOUR HUMANITY IS SO MUCH INTERESTED
HE IS WAITING IN A COACH AT THE DOOR REPLIED ROSE AT THIS DOOR CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH WHICH HE HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM DOWN THE STAIRS UP THE COACHSTEPS AND INTO THE COACH WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
IF YOU BURIED HIM FIFTY FEET DEEP AND TOOK ME ACROSS HIS GRAVE I FANCY I SHOULD KNOW IF THERE WASN'T A MARK ABOVE IT
GETTING OUT OF A COACH REPLIED OLIVER SHEDDING TEARS OF DELIGHT AND GOING INTO A HOUSE I DIDN'T SPEAK TO HIM I COULDN'T SPEAK TO HIM FOR HE DIDN'T SEE ME AND I TREMBLED SO THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO GO UP TO HIM BUT GILES ASKED FOR ME
SAID THE DOCTOR NONE AT ALL SIR REPLIED MISTER GILES WITH MUCH GRAVITY WELL SAID THE DOCTOR I AM SORRY TO HEAR IT BECAUSE YOU DO THAT SORT OF THING ADMIRABLY PRAY HOW IS BRITTLES
RESERVING NANCY'S INFORMATION FOR THAT GENTLEMAN'S PRIVATE EAR AND CONCLUDING WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HIS ONLY SORROW FOR SOME MONTHS PAST HAD BEEN NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET WITH HIS FORMER BENEFACTOR AND FRIEND THANK GOD SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN
IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE HARRY SAID MISSUS MAYLIE
WHAT GOOD SHOULD WE BRING ABOUT HANGING A FEW OF THEM AT LEAST IN ALL PROBABILITY SUGGESTED THE DOCTOR AND TRANSPORTING THE REST VERY GOOD REPLIED MISTER BROWNLOW SMILING
AND THE PROSPECT IT COMMANDED WAS VERY EXTENSIVE ONE BEAUTIFUL EVENING WHEN THE FIRST SHADES OF TWILIGHT WERE BEGINNING TO SETTLE UPON THE EARTH OLIVER SAT AT THIS WINDOW INTENT UPON HIS BOOKS HE HAD BEEN PORING OVER THEM FOR SOME TIME
LADEN WITH FLOWERS WHICH HE HAD CULLED WITH PECULIAR CARE FOR THE ADORNMENT OF THE SICK CHAMBER AS HE WALKED BRISKLY ALONG THE ROAD HE HEARD BEHIND HIM THE NOISE OF SOME VEHICLE APPROACHING AT A FURIOUS PACE
HE BORE SO STRONG A LIKENESS TO THE OLD LADY THAT OLIVER WOULD HAVE HAD NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN IMAGINING THEIR RELATIONSHIP IF HE HAD NOT ALREADY SPOKEN OF HER AS HIS MOTHER MISSUS MAYLIE WAS ANXIOUSLY WAITING TO RECEIVE HER SON WHEN HE REACHED THE COTTAGE
OLIVER FELT STUNNED AND STUPEFIED BY THE UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE HE COULD NOT WEEP OR SPEAK OR REST HE HAD SCARCELY THE POWER OF UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING THAT HAD PASSED UNTIL AFTER A LONG RAMBLE IN THE QUIET EVENING AIR
THE GOOD SOUL LAUGHED AND WEPT UPON HIS NECK BY TURNS LEAVING HER AND OLIVER TO COMPARE NOTES AT LEISURE MISTER BROWNLOW LED THE WAY INTO ANOTHER ROOM AND THERE HEARD FROM ROSE A FULL NARRATION OF HER INTERVIEW WITH NANCY
I HAVE NO THOUGHT NO VIEW NO HOPE IN LIFE BEYOND HER AND IF YOU OPPOSE ME IN THIS GREAT STAKE YOU TAKE MY PEACE AND HAPPINESS IN YOUR HANDS AND CAST THEM TO THE WIND MOTHER THINK BETTER OF THIS AND OF ME
THERE IS A KIND OF SLEEP THAT STEALS UPON US SOMETIMES WHICH WHILE IT HOLDS THE BODY PRISONER DOES NOT FREE THE MIND FROM A SENSE OF THINGS ABOUT IT AND ENABLE IT TO RAMBLE AT ITS PLEASURE SO FAR AS AN OVERPOWERING HEAVINESS A PROSTRATION OF STRENGTH
ACCOMMODATE THEMSELVES WITH SURPRISING READINESS TO OUR VISIONS UNTIL REALITY AND IMAGINATION BECOME SO STRANGELY BLENDED THAT IT IS AFTERWARDS ALMOST MATTER OF IMPOSSIBILITY TO SEPARATE THE TWO
AND SOME SLIGHT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR KINDNESS TO OLIVER NOT EXACTLY THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW LAUGHING BUT WE MUST PROCEED GENTLY AND WITH GREAT CARE GENTLENESS AND CARE EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR
WHEN THE ROOM DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM MISTER GRIMWIG LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND CONVERTING ONE OF THE HIND LEGS OF HIS CHAIR INTO A PIVOT DESCRIBED THREE DISTINCT CIRCLES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS STICK AND THE TABLE SITTING IN IT ALL THE TIME AFTER PERFORMING THIS EVOLUTION
AND IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO PRODUCE ANY EVIDENCE WHICH WILL ALTER THE UNFAVOURABLE OPINION I WAS ONCE INDUCED TO ENTERTAIN OF THAT POOR CHILD IN HEAVEN'S NAME PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF IT A BAD ONE I'LL EAT MY HEAD IF HE IS NOT A BAD ONE
WHICH OCCASIONED HIM NO LITTLE SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY ROSE ALSO EXPLAINED HER REASONS FOR NOT CONFIDING IN HER FRIEND MISTER LOSBERNE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE OLD GENTLEMAN CONSIDERED THAT SHE HAD ACTED PRUDENTLY
OLIVER NEEDED NO PROMPTING TO DESPATCH AND IN LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CRAVEN STREET WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE ROSE LEFT OLIVER IN THE COACH UNDER PRETENCE OF PREPARING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO RECEIVE HIM
AND AS THE DAY HAD BEEN UNCOMMONLY SULTRY AND HE HAD EXERTED HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL IT IS NO DISPARAGEMENT TO THE AUTHORS WHOEVER THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TO SAY THAT GRADUALLY AND BY SLOW DEGREES HE FELL ASLEEP
OLIVER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE WAS IN HIS OWN LITTLE ROOM THAT HIS BOOKS WERE LYING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM THAT THE SWEET AIR WAS STIRRING AMONG THE CREEPING PLANTS OUTSIDE AND YET HE WAS ASLEEP SUDDENLY THE SCENE CHANGED
HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE STEPS OF THE CHAISE SUPPORTING AN ELBOW ON EACH KNEE AND WIPING HIS EYES WITH A BLUE COTTON POCKET HANDKERCHIEF DOTTED WITH WHITE SPOTS THAT THE HONEST FELLOW HAD NOT BEEN FEIGNING EMOTION
HAVE YOU SHOT ANYTHING PARTICULAR LATELY GILES INQUIRED THE DOCTOR WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED NOTHING PARTICULAR SIR REPLIED MISTER GILES COLOURING UP TO THE EYES NOR CATCHING ANY THIEVES NOR IDENTIFYING ANY HOUSE BREAKERS
AND AGAIN RECOILING FROM ALL AS EACH SUCCESSIVE CONSIDERATION PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER MIND ROSE PASSED A SLEEPLESS AND ANXIOUS NIGHT AFTER MORE COMMUNING WITH HERSELF NEXT DAY SHE ARRIVED AT THE DESPERATE CONCLUSION OF CONSULTING HARRY
WHETHER YOU THINK IT REASONABLE THAT THIS PROMISE TO THE GIRL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BINDING A PROMISE MADE WITH THE BEST AND KINDEST INTENTIONS BUT REALLY DO NOT DISCUSS THE POINT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY PRAY SAID MISTER BROWNLOW INTERRUPTING ROSE AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK
OLIVER COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT THE WITHERED FLOWERS WERE NEVER THROWN AWAY ALTHOUGH THE LITTLE VASE WAS REGULARLY REPLENISHED NOR COULD HE HELP OBSERVING THAT WHENEVER THE DOCTOR CAME INTO THE GARDEN HE INVARIABLY CAST HIS EYES UP TO THAT PARTICULAR CORNER
AND WENT ABOUT HIS USUAL OCCUPATIONS WITH MORE HOPE AND PLEASURE THAN HE HAD KNOWN FOR MANY DAYS THE BIRDS WERE ONCE MORE HUNG OUT TO SING IN THEIR OLD PLACES AND THE SWEETEST WILD FLOWERS THAT COULD BE FOUND WERE ONCE MORE GATHERED TO GLADDEN ROSE WITH THEIR BEAUTY
TO CALL IN THE AID OF MY FRIEND GRIMWIG HE IS A STRANGE CREATURE BUT A SHREWD ONE AND MIGHT PROVE OF MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO US I SHOULD SAY THAT HE WAS BRED A LAWYER AND QUITTED THE BAR IN DISGUST BECAUSE HE HAD ONLY ONE BRIEF AND A MOTION OF COURSE
BUT WHAT IS THIS OF WHOM DO YOU SPEAK I HAVE SEEN THE GENTLEMAN REPLIED OLIVER SCARCELY ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS SO GOOD TO ME MISTER BROWNLOW THAT WE HAVE SO OFTEN TALKED ABOUT WHERE ASKED ROSE
AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES LIKE MISFORTUNES SELDOM COME ALONE HER SITUATION WAS INDEED ONE OF NO COMMON TRIAL AND DIFFICULTY
SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RATHER TESTILY WELL THAT I DO SIR REPLIED THE OLD LADY PEOPLE'S EYES AT MY TIME OF LIFE DON'T IMPROVE WITH AGE SIR I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW
AND WERE WITHAL AS ORIGINAL AND AS MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AS THE REMARKS OF GREAT MEN COMMONLY ARE ABOVE STAIRS THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY FOR THE DOCTOR WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND HOWEVER FATIGUED OR THOUGHTFUL HARRY MAYLIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT FIRST
THAT CREPT OVER THE CASEMENT AND FILLED THE PLACE WITH THEIR DELICIOUS PERFUME IT LOOKED INTO A GARDEN WHENCE A WICKET GATE OPENED INTO A SMALL PADDOCK ALL BEYOND WAS FINE MEADOW LAND AND WOOD THERE WAS NO OTHER DWELLING NEAR IN THAT DIRECTION
HE JERKED HIMSELF AS IT WERE BY A CONVULSION INTO HIS FORMER ATTITUDE AND LOOKING OUT STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM EMITTED A LONG DEEP WHISTLE WHICH SEEMED AT LAST
THERE THERE AT THE WINDOW CLOSE BEFORE HIM SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD HAVE ALMOST TOUCHED HIM BEFORE HE STARTED BACK WITH HIS EYES PEERING INTO THE ROOM AND MEETING HIS THERE STOOD THE JEW AND BESIDE HIM WHITE WITH RAGE OR FEAR OR BOTH

MORE DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE MIGHT SOME DAY EVEN BE HIS PROBLEM AT PRESENT IT ROUSED ONLY HIS PROFOUND DISTASTE HE WALKED OVER TO FIFTH AVENUE DODGING THE BLIND BLACK MENACE OF UMBRELLAS AND STANDING IN FRONT OF DELMONICO'S HAILED AN AUTO BUS
FINALLY THE RATTLING BANG OF FOLDING SEATS INSIDE ANNOUNCED THAT THE USHERS WERE AT WORK NEW YORK SEEMED NOT SO MUCH AWAKENING AS TURNING OVER IN ITS BED PALLID MEN RUSHED BY PINCHING TOGETHER THEIR COAT COLLARS
THE SILENCE OF THE THEATRE BEHIND HIM ENDED WITH A CURIOUS SNAPPING SOUND FOLLOWED BY THE HEAVY ROARING OF A RISING CROWD AND THE INTERLACED CLATTER OF MANY VOICES THE MATINEE WAS OVER
THE AIR BECAME GRAY AND OPALESCENT A SOLITARY LIGHT SUDDENLY OUTLINED A WINDOW OVER THE WAY THEN ANOTHER LIGHT THEN A HUNDRED MORE DANCED AND GLIMMERED INTO VISION UNDER HIS FEET A THICK IRON STUDDED SKYLIGHT TURNED YELLOW
WE NEED NOT SAY THAT A SMILE OF CONDESCENSION WAS STAMPED UPON HIS LIPS GOOD MORNING CREDITOR SAID HE FOR I WAGER ANYTHING IT IS THE CREDITOR WHO VISITS ME
HIS BANKER DANGLARS IS HIS BANKER IS HE NOT ASKED CHATEAU RENAUD OF DEBRAY I BELIEVE SO REPLIED THE SECRETARY WITH SLIGHT UNEASINESS BUT MONTE CRISTO IS NOT THE ONLY ONE I MISS HERE I DO NOT SEE MORREL
BECOMING REALLY INSINCERE CALLING MYSELF NOT SUCH A BAD FELLOW THINKING I REGRETTED MY LOST YOUTH WHEN I ONLY ENVY THE DELIGHTS OF LOSING IT
BUT DID YOU RECEIVE MY LETTER YESTERDAY YES I HAVE BROUGHT MY RECEIPT
AND THEY BOTH RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY TO THE PROCUREUR'S STUDY
NO WITH A RELATION BUT STILL WE HAVE QUITE LOST OUR DEAR EUGENIE FOR I DOUBT WHETHER HER PRIDE WILL EVER ALLOW HER TO RETURN TO FRANCE STILL BARON SAID MONTE CRISTO
IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED BUT THE ARTICLE IS NOT MINE
WONDER WHAT HUMBIRD'S BODY LOOKED LIKE NOW IF HE HIMSELF HADN'T BEEN BAYONET INSTRUCTOR HE'D HAVE GONE UP TO LINE THREE MONTHS SOONER PROBABLY BEEN KILLED WHERE'S THE DARNED BELL
OH WORK WORK MY PASSION MY JOY MY DELIGHT IT IS FOR THEE TO ALLEVIATE MY SORROWS
THAT REMINDS ME HE SAID THAT WHEN YOU ENTERED I WAS ON THE POINT OF SIGNING FIVE LITTLE BONDS I HAVE ALREADY SIGNED TWO WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO DO THE SAME TO THE OTHERS PRAY DO SO
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE DURING WHICH THE NOISE OF THE BANKER'S PEN WAS ALONE HEARD WHILE MONTE CRISTO EXAMINED THE GILT MOULDINGS ON THE CEILING ARE THEY SPANISH HAITIAN
CERTAINLY IT WILL ONLY COST YOU A DISCOUNT OF FIVE THOUSAND OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS THE RECEIVER STARTED BACK MA FOI HE SAID I PREFER WAITING TILL TO MORROW WHAT A PROPOSITION
OH DEAR YES AND IF YOU WERE AT ROME THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH WOULD MAKE NO MORE DIFFICULTY ABOUT PAYING THE MONEY ON MY RECEIPT THAN YOU HAVE JUST DONE PARDON ME COUNT PARDON ME THEN I MAY KEEP THIS MONEY YES SAID DANGLARS
PAY ME IN A DIFFERENT FORM I WISHED FROM CURIOSITY TO TAKE THESE THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT WITHOUT ANY ADVICE OR PREPARATION THE HOUSE OF DANGLARS HAD PAID ME FIVE MILLIONS WITHOUT A MINUTE'S DELAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE BUT HERE ARE YOUR BONDS PAY ME DIFFERENTLY
AH YOU ARE LAUGHING AT ME SEND TO MORROW AT TWELVE AND THE BANK SHALL BE NOTIFIED I WILL COME MYSELF BETTER STILL SINCE IT WILL AFFORD ME THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU THEY SHOOK HANDS
ARE YOU THEN PRESSED FOR THIS MONEY YES FOR THE EXAMINATION OF OUR CASH TAKES PLACE TO MORROW TO MORROW WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME SO BEFORE WHY IT IS AS GOOD AS A CENTURY AT WHAT HOUR DOES THE EXAMINATION TAKE PLACE AT TWO O'CLOCK
DANGLARS SIGNATURE THE NEXT MORNING DAWNED DULL AND CLOUDY DURING THE NIGHT THE UNDERTAKERS HAD EXECUTED THEIR MELANCHOLY OFFICE AND WRAPPED THE CORPSE IN THE WINDING SHEET
OR NEAPOLITAN BONDS SAID MONTE CRISTO NO SAID DANGLARS SMILING
IT IS ONE OF THE BEST HOUSES IN EUROPE SAID DANGLARS CARELESSLY THROWING DOWN THE RECEIPT ON HIS DESK AND HE HAD FIVE MILLIONS IN YOUR HANDS ALONE WHY THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO MUST BE A NABOB INDEED I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS
NO DECIDEDLY NO KEEP MY SIGNATURES BUT YOU KNOW NONE ARE SO FORMAL AS BANKERS IN TRANSACTING BUSINESS I INTENDED THIS MONEY FOR THE CHARITY FUND AND I SEEMED TO BE ROBBING THEM IF I DID NOT PAY THEM WITH THESE PRECISE BONDS HOW ABSURD
THE DAY WITH THE WIFE OF THE WORTHY GENTLEMAN WHO IS RECEIVING US WHO IS HE
THAT'S WHY A GOOD MAN GOING WRONG ATTRACTS PEOPLE THEY STAND AROUND AND LITERALLY WARM THEMSELVES AT THE CALORIES OF VIRTUE HE GIVES OFF SARAH MAKES AN UNSOPHISTICATED REMARK AND THE FACES SIMPER IN DELIGHT HOW INNOCENT THE POOR CHILD IS
SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE INSULT OFFERED TO US BY THAT WRETCH SO SHE ASKED PERMISSION TO TRAVEL AND IS SHE GONE THE OTHER NIGHT SHE LEFT
YOU DID SEE HIM I THINK YES WELL
HE STOOD ASIDE EDGED A LITTLE INTO THE RAIN TO LET THE THRONG PASS A SMALL BOY RUSHED OUT SNIFFED IN THE DAMP FRESH AIR AND TURNED UP THE COLLAR OF HIS COAT CAME THREE OR FOUR COUPLES IN A GREAT HURRY
SHALL YOU BE PRESENT IN THE RECEPTION ROOM NO I HAVE A COUSIN WHO HAS UNDERTAKEN THIS SAD OFFICE I SHALL WORK DOCTOR
AT THE DOOR HE FOUND HIS CARRIAGE AND WAS IMMEDIATELY DRIVEN TO THE BANK
THERE IS STILL A SUM OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OH A MERE NOTHING SAID MONTE CRISTO THE BALANCE WOULD COME TO ABOUT THAT SUM BUT KEEP IT AND WE SHALL BE QUITS COUNT SAID DANGLARS ARE YOU SPEAKING SERIOUSLY
TWO AND THREE LOOK ALIKE NO NOT MUCH SEAT DAMP ARE CLOTHES ABSORBING WETNESS FROM SEAT OR SEAT ABSORBING DRYNESS FROM CLOTHES SITTING ON WET SUBSTANCE GAVE APPENDICITIS SO FROGGY PARKER'S MOTHER SAID WELL HE'D HAD IT
AND SAYING SOMETHING TO HIS COMPANION WITH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST PROBABLY THOUGHT AMORY WHAT HE SAID WAS MY GOD AREN'T PEOPLE HORRIBLE NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD AMORY CONSIDERED POOR PEOPLE
LEAVING HARD BROWN DEPOSITS IN THE BOWL IT WAS NOT SO BAD WHERE THERE WERE ONLY MEN OR ELSE ONLY WOMEN IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE VILELY HERDED THAT IT ALL SEEMED SO ROTTEN IT WAS SOME SHAME THAT WOMEN GAVE OFF AT HAVING MEN SEE THEM TIRED AND POOR
THEY DON'T THEY JUST WANT THE FUN OF EATING IT ALL OVER AGAIN THE MATRON DOESN'T WANT TO REPEAT HER GIRLHOOD SHE WANTS TO REPEAT HER HONEYMOON
NO SAID THE BANKER I HAVE APPEARED RATHER RIDICULOUS SINCE THAT AFFAIR OF BENEDETTO SO I REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND BAH YOU ARE WRONG HOW WERE YOU TO BLAME IN THAT AFFAIR
ONE OF THEM WAS MADE OF DEBRAY CHATEAU RENAUD AND BEAUCHAMP POOR GIRL SAID DEBRAY LIKE THE REST PAYING AN INVOLUNTARY TRIBUTE TO THE SAD EVENT POOR GIRL
NOW I THINK OF IT YOU CAN DO BETTER SAID DANGLARS HOW DO YOU MEAN
STAY COUNT HE ADDED YOU WHO MAY BE CALLED THE EMPEROR IF I CLAIM THE TITLE OF KING OF FINANCE HAVE YOU MANY PIECES OF PAPER OF THIS SIZE EACH WORTH A MILLION
FOR WHAT REASON BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT SPEND MONEY SO GUILTILY ACQUIRED
IF A THUNDERBOLT HAD FALLEN AT THE BANKER'S FEET
AT BEST JUST PEOPLE TOO HOT OR TOO COLD TIRED WORRIED HE PICTURED THE ROOMS WHERE THESE PEOPLE LIVED WHERE THE PATTERNS OF THE BLISTERED WALL PAPERS WERE HEAVY REITERATED SUNFLOWERS ON GREEN AND YELLOW BACKGROUNDS
AND MONTE CRISTO PLACED THE BONDS IN HIS POCKET WITH ONE HAND
AND SOME OF OUR OLD FRIENDS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE WE MEAN DEBRAY
NOT NECESSARILY QUESTION WHAT WOULD BE THE TEST OF CORRUPTION
FOR EXAMPLE LOOK AT THE PURITANICAL PROCUREUR WHO HAS JUST LOST HIS DAUGHTER AND IN FACT NEARLY ALL HIS FAMILY IN SO SINGULAR A MANNER MORCERF DISHONORED AND DEAD
THE QUERULOUS WORRY AS TO WHETHER SOME ONE ISN'T LEANING ON YOU A MAN DECIDING NOT TO GIVE HIS SEAT TO A WOMAN HATING HER FOR IT THE WOMAN HATING HIM FOR NOT DOING IT AT WORST A SQUALID PHANTASMAGORIA OF BREATH
I THINK I ARRIVED JUST IN TIME TO OBTAIN YOUR SIGNATURES OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DISPUTED WITH ME
THIS DIALOGUE MERGED GROTESQUELY INTO HIS MIND'S MOST FAMILIAR STATE A GROTESQUE BLENDING OF DESIRES WORRIES EXTERIOR IMPRESSIONS AND PHYSICAL REACTIONS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVENTH STREET OR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVENTH STREET
GRIEF DOES NOT STUN ME I HAVE NOT BEEN IN BED FOR TWO NIGHTS BUT THEN LOOK AT MY DESK SEE WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN DURING THESE TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS I HAVE FILLED THOSE PAPERS AND HAVE MADE OUT THE ACCUSATION AGAINST THE ASSASSIN BENEDETTO
YOU THEREFORE STILL OWE ME FIVE MILLIONS AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS I WILL TAKE THE FIVE SCRAPS OF PAPER THAT I NOW HOLD AS BONDS WITH YOUR SIGNATURE ALONE AND HERE IS A RECEIPT IN FULL FOR THE SIX MILLIONS BETWEEN US
I THINK SO I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL AT ALL ANY MORE QUESTION IS THAT A BAD SIGN IN ITSELF
AND ALWAYS THERE WAS THE ECONOMICAL STUFFINESS OF INDOOR WINTER AND THE LONG SUMMERS NIGHTMARES OF PERSPIRATION BETWEEN STICKY ENVELOPING WALLS DIRTY RESTAURANTS WHERE CARELESS TIRED PEOPLE HELPED THEMSELVES TO SUGAR WITH THEIR OWN USED COFFEE SPOONS
A GREAT SWARM OF TIRED MAGPIE GIRLS FROM A DEPARTMENT STORE CROWDED ALONG WITH SHRIEKS OF STRIDENT LAUGHTER THREE TO AN UMBRELLA A SQUAD OF MARCHING POLICEMEN PASSED ALREADY MIRACULOUSLY PROTECTED BY OILSKIN CAPES THE RAIN GAVE AMORY A FEELING OF DETACHMENT
AND DANGER IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREIN BIRTH AND MARRIAGE AND DEATH WERE LOATHSOME SECRET THINGS HE REMEMBERED ONE DAY IN THE SUBWAY WHEN A DELIVERY BOY HAD BROUGHT IN A GREAT FUNERAL WREATH OF FRESH FLOWERS
OWN TASTE THE BEST ISABELLE CLARA ROSALIND ELEANOR WERE ALL AMERICAN ELEANOR WOULD PITCH PROBABLY SOUTHPAW ROSALIND WAS OUTFIELD WONDERFUL HITTER CLARA FIRST BASE MAYBE
HE WHO WISHES MISFORTUNES TO HAPPEN TO OTHERS EXPERIENCES THEM HIMSELF WELL ON MY WORD OF HONOR I ANSWERED NO I WISHED NO ILL TO MORCERF HE WAS A LITTLE PROUD PERHAPS FOR A MAN WHO LIKE MYSELF HAS RISEN FROM NOTHING
FIVE MILLIONS HERE IS HIS RECEIPT BELIEVE YOUR OWN EYES
UPON THE MOTHER RETIRES INTO THE COUNTRY AND THE SON ENTERS THE ARMY WELL I MUST CONFESS THESE ARE SCRUPLES I REGISTERED THEIR DEED OF GIFT YESTERDAY AND HOW MUCH DID THEY POSSESS OH NOT MUCH
TAKE IT TO ROTHSCHILD'S OR LAFITTE'S AND THEY WILL TAKE IT OFF YOUR HANDS AT ONCE
CAME A FURTHER SCATTERING OF PEOPLE WHOSE EYES AS THEY EMERGED GLANCED INVARIABLY FIRST AT THE WET STREET THEN AT THE RAIN FILLED AIR FINALLY AT THE DISMAL SKY LAST A DENSE STROLLING MASS
THAT DEPRESSED HIM WITH ITS HEAVY ODOR COMPOUNDED OF THE TOBACCO SMELL OF THE MEN AND THE FETID SENSUOUSNESS OF STALE POWDER ON WOMEN AFTER THE THICK CROWD CAME ANOTHER SCATTERING A STRAY HALF DOZEN A MAN ON CRUTCHES
WHAT HE STAMMERED DO YOU MEAN TO KEEP THAT MONEY EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME BUT I OWE THIS MONEY TO THE CHARITY FUND A DEPOSIT WHICH I PROMISED TO PAY THIS MORNING OH WELL THEN SAID MONTE CRISTO
THAT IS BEING WRESTED FROM ITS GRASP SUDDENLY HE RALLIED MADE A VIOLENT EFFORT TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF AND THEN A SMILE GRADUALLY WIDENED THE FEATURES OF HIS DISTURBED COUNTENANCE CERTAINLY HE SAID YOUR RECEIPT IS MONEY
I WILL SET BEFORE HIM THE EXAMPLE OF MADAME DE MORCERF AND HER SON WHAT EXAMPLE THEY GAVE ALL THEIR FORTUNE TO THE HOSPITALS WHAT FORTUNE THEIR OWN
FOR INDEED MISFORTUNE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF MY HOUSE WHEN I PERCEIVED YOU I WAS JUST ASKING MYSELF WHETHER I HAD NOT WISHED HARM TOWARDS THOSE POOR MORCERFS WHICH WOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED THE PROVERB OF
HE SLEEPS INDEED AND THIS IS THE MORE STRANGE SINCE THE LEAST CONTRADICTION KEEPS HIM AWAKE ALL NIGHT
THE GENTLEMAN WHO RECEIVES US IS HE A DEPUTY OH NO I AM CONDEMNED TO WITNESS THOSE GENTLEMEN EVERY DAY SAID BEAUCHAMP BUT HE IS PERFECTLY UNKNOWN TO ME HAVE YOU MENTIONED THIS DEATH IN YOUR PAPER
LISTEN WHEN ONE BEARS AN IRREPROACHABLE NAME AS I DO ONE IS RATHER SENSITIVE
BUT WHOM ARE YOU SEEKING DEBRAY I AM SEEKING THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO SAID THE YOUNG MAN
BUT OLD MONOTONY IS THERE ENDLESS AVENUES OF RAIN OH MIGHT I RISE AGAIN MIGHT I THROW OFF THE HEAT OF THAT OLD WINE SEE THE NEW MORNING MASS THE SKY WITH FAIRY TOWERS LINE ON LINE
EUGENIE HAS LEFT US GOOD HEAVENS WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME THE TRUTH MY DEAR COUNT OH HOW HAPPY YOU MUST BE IN NOT HAVING EITHER WIFE OR CHILDREN DO YOU THINK SO INDEED I DO
A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT IN OUR STORY AS IN THE WORLD HE OCCUPIED ONE OF THOSE BEINGS DESIGNED FROM THEIR BIRTH TO MAKE THEMSELVES USEFUL TO OTHERS HE WAS PUNCTUAL DRESSED IN BLACK WITH CRAPE AROUND HIS HAT
IF YOU WISHED TO DEMOLISH THEM YOU COULD NOT AND IF IT WERE POSSIBLE YOU WOULD NOT DARE
THE CHARITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES TO YOU THROUGH ME THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS DEPUTE ME TO RECEIVE ALMS TO THE AMOUNT OF FIVE MILLIONS FROM YOU
HOW THE SMELL OF IT HAD SUDDENLY CLEARED THE AIR AND GIVEN EVERY ONE IN THE CAR A MOMENTARY GLOW I DETEST POOR PEOPLE THOUGHT AMORY SUDDENLY I HATE THEM FOR BEING POOR POVERTY MAY HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL ONCE BUT IT'S ROTTEN NOW
WHICH WHATEVER MAY BE SAID ABOUT THE EQUALITY OF DEATH IS AT LEAST A LAST PROOF OF THE LUXURY SO PLEASING IN LIFE THIS WINDING SHEET WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF CAMBRIC
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO NOR HAVE I MUCH CURIOSITY TO MORROW I'M GOING TO LEAVE NEW YORK FOR GOOD IT'S A BAD TOWN UNLESS YOU'RE ON TOP OF IT QUESTION DO YOU WANT A LOT OF MONEY A
AS THOUGH TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER HE SPOKE SERIOUSLY YES HE ANSWERED IF A FORTUNE BRINGS CONSOLATION I OUGHT TO BE CONSOLED I AM RICH
SOMEWHERE IN HIS MIND A CONVERSATION BEGAN RATHER RESUMED ITS PLACE IN HIS ATTENTION IT WAS COMPOSED NOT OF TWO VOICES BUT OF ONE WHICH ACTED ALIKE AS QUESTIONER AND ANSWERER QUESTION WELL WHAT'S THE SITUATION ANSWER
THEY ARE GONE TO SEEK A VERY STRICT CONVENT IN ITALY OR SPAIN
HE HAS THREE UNLIMITED CREDITS ONE ON ME ONE ON ROTHSCHILD ONE ON LAFITTE AND YOU SEE HE ADDED CARELESSLY HE HAS GIVEN ME THE PREFERENCE BY LEAVING A BALANCE OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
A FATHOM DEEP IN SLEEP I LIE WITH OLD DESIRES RESTRAINED BEFORE TO CLAMOR LIFEWARD WITH A CRY AS DARK FLIES OUT THE GREYING DOOR AND SO IN QUEST OF CREEDS TO SHARE I SEEK ASSERTIVE DAY AGAIN
I MUST VISIT HIM HE SAID AND OBTAIN SOME PIOUS GRANT FROM HIM OH YOU MAY MAKE SURE OF HIM HIS CHARITIES ALONE AMOUNT TO TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH IT IS MAGNIFICENT
I NEVER JOKE WITH BANKERS SAID MONTE CRISTO IN A FREEZING MANNER WHICH REPELLED IMPERTINENCE
WHO WAS STANDING IN THE WAITING ROOM AND WHO WAS INTRODUCED INTO DANGLARS ROOM AS SOON AS THE COUNT HAD LEFT THE COUNT'S SAD FACE WAS ILLUMINED BY A FAINT SMILE AS HE NOTICED THE PORTFOLIO WHICH THE RECEIVER GENERAL HELD IN HIS HAND
AFTER EXPRESSING ACUTE SYMPATHY WITH THE FATHER
AND WHO BOWED TO ME AS THOUGH HE KNEW ME
THAT MONEY MITIGATES MANY TRIALS AND IF YOU ADMIT THE EFFICACY OF THIS SOVEREIGN BALM YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY EASILY CONSOLED YOU THE KING OF FINANCE THE FOCUS OF IMMEASURABLE POWER
FOOL THEN ENCLOSING MONTE CRISTO'S RECEIPT IN A LITTLE POCKET BOOK HE ADDED YES COME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK I SHALL THEN BE FAR AWAY THEN HE DOUBLE LOCKED HIS DOOR EMPTIED ALL HIS DRAWERS COLLECTED ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN BANK NOTES
UNCLE HAD ONLY PAID HUNDRED A MONTH FOR WHOLE GREAT BIG HOUSE IN MINNEAPOLIS QUESTION WERE THE STAIRS ON THE LEFT OR RIGHT AS YOU CAME IN ANYWAY IN TWELVE UNIVEE THEY WERE STRAIGHT BACK AND TO THE LEFT WHAT A DIRTY RIVER
ACCOMPANIED BY ALL THE LEADING MEN OF THE DAY AT THE BAR IN LITERATURE OR THE ARMY
JUST PASSIVELY AFRAID QUESTION
BURNED SEVERAL PAPERS LEFT OTHERS EXPOSED TO VIEW
RATHER I DON'T WANT TO COMMIT MORAL SUICIDE QUESTION HAVE YOU NO INTERESTS LEFT
EQUALLY PLEASED TO WITNESS THE FESTIVITIES OR THE MOURNING OF THE RICH AND WHO RUSH WITH THE SAME AVIDITY TO A FUNERAL PROCESSION AS TO THE MARRIAGE OF A DUCHESS GRADUALLY THE RECEPTION ROOM FILLED
STILL HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HERE SAID DEBRAY I WONDER WHAT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT TO NIGHT THIS FUNERAL IS THE NEWS OF THE DAY BUT HUSH HERE COMES OUR MINISTER OF JUSTICE
THEY'RE WARMING THEMSELVES AT HER VIRTUE BUT SARAH SEES THE SIMPER AND NEVER MAKES THAT REMARK AGAIN ONLY SHE FEELS A LITTLE COLDER AFTER THAT QUESTION ALL YOUR CALORIES GONE
HE THOUGHT CYNICALLY HOW COMPLETELY HE WAS LACKING IN ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY O HENRY HAD FOUND IN THESE PEOPLE ROMANCE PATHOS LOVE HATE AMORY SAW ONLY COARSENESS PHYSICAL FILTH AND STUPIDITY HE MADE NO SELF ACCUSATIONS
FAMILY GRIEFS OR INDEED ANY OTHER AFFLICTION WHICH WOULD CRUSH A MAN WHOSE CHILD WAS HIS ONLY TREASURE ARE ENDURABLE TO A MILLIONAIRE PHILOSOPHERS MAY WELL SAY AND PRACTICAL MEN WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT THE OPINION
ALL OF THEM I'M BEGINNING TO WARM MYSELF AT OTHER PEOPLE'S VIRTUE QUESTION ARE YOU CORRUPT
IT WAS SOME DISGUST THAT MEN HAD FOR WOMEN WHO WERE TIRED AND POOR IT WAS DIRTIER THAN ANY BATTLE FIELD HE HAD SEEN
SO YOUNG SO RICH SO BEAUTIFUL COULD YOU HAVE IMAGINED THIS SCENE CHATEAU RENAUD WHEN WE SAW HER AT THE MOST THREE WEEKS AGO ABOUT TO SIGN THAT CONTRACT INDEED NO SAID CHATEAU RENAUD DID YOU KNOW HER
SAYNE WHAT THE DEVIL NECK HURTS DARNED UNCOMFORTABLE SEAT NO DESIRE TO SLEEP WITH JILL WHAT COULD ALEC SEE IN HER
IF IT WASN'T APPENDICITIS INFLUENZA MAYBE WHAT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTIETH STREET
NONE I'VE NO MORE VIRTUE TO LOSE JUST AS A COOLING POT GIVES OFF HEAT SO ALL THROUGH YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE WE GIVE OFF CALORIES OF VIRTUE THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED INGENUOUSNESS QUESTION AN INTERESTING IDEA
NO SAID MONTE CRISTO FOLDING THE FIVE NOTES MOST DECIDEDLY NOT THE THING IS SO CURIOUS I WILL MAKE THE EXPERIMENT MYSELF I AM CREDITED ON YOU FOR SIX MILLIONS I HAVE DRAWN NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
HOW SO THE COUNT HAS AN UNLIMITED CREDIT UPON ME A CREDIT OPENED BY THOMSON AND FRENCH OF ROME HE CAME TO DEMAND FIVE MILLIONS AT ONCE WHICH I PAID HIM WITH CHECKS ON THE BANK MY FUNDS ARE DEPOSITED THERE AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
AS IF ONE CROWN WERE NOT AS GOOD AS ANOTHER EXCUSE ME AND HE BEGAN TO LAUGH LOUDLY BUT NERVOUSLY CERTAINLY I EXCUSE YOU SAID MONTE CRISTO GRACIOUSLY AND POCKET THEM AND HE PLACED THE BONDS IN HIS POCKET BOOK BUT
AND PRESENTED HIMSELF AT HIS COUSIN'S WITH A FACE MADE UP FOR THE OCCASION AND WHICH HE COULD ALTER AS MIGHT BE REQUIRED AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE MOURNING COACHES ROLLED INTO THE PAVED COURT
THAT I HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS TO MY NAME QUESTION
BUT WE ALL HAVE OUR FAULTS DO YOU KNOW COUNT THAT PERSONS OF OUR TIME OF LIFE NOT THAT YOU BELONG TO THE CLASS YOU ARE STILL A YOUNG MAN BUT AS I WAS SAYING PERSONS OF OUR TIME OF LIFE HAVE BEEN VERY UNFORTUNATE THIS YEAR
AND ADVANCED TO MEET HIM WITH A SAD THOUGH AFFABLE SMILE WELL SAID HE EXTENDING HIS HAND TO MONTE CRISTO
TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK PLEASE PAY TO MY ORDER FROM THE FUND DEPOSITED BY ME THE SUM OF A MILLION AND CHARGE THE SAME TO MY ACCOUNT BARON DANGLARS
WHILE THE PERSPIRATION STARTED FROM THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR YES KEEP IT KEEP IT MONTE CRISTO REPLACED THE NOTES IN HIS POCKET WITH THAT INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED TO SAY COME REFLECT IF YOU REPENT THERE IS STILL TIME
THAT YOU HAD A DEFICIENCY TO MAKE UP INDEED SAID THE RECEIVER AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE IT WOULD BE WORTH WHILE TO MAKE SOME SACRIFICE THANK YOU NO SIR THEN IT WILL BE TO MORROW YES BUT WITHOUT FAIL
LESS OWING TO HIS SOCIAL POSITION THAN TO HIS PERSONAL MERIT THE COUSIN STANDING AT THE DOOR USHERED IN THE GUESTS AND IT WAS RATHER A RELIEF TO THE INDIFFERENT TO SEE A PERSON AS UNMOVED AS THEMSELVES
DON'T ASK ME QUESTION DON'T YOU CARE
AND THEN MYSELF COVERED WITH RIDICULE THROUGH THE VILLANY OF BENEDETTO BESIDES BESIDES WHAT ASKED THE COUNT ALAS DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT NEW CALAMITY MY DAUGHTER
FROM TWELVE TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS BUT TO RETURN TO OUR MILLIONS
IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
AND WHO DID NOT EXACT A MOURNFUL FACE OR FORCE TEARS AS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE WITH A FATHER A BROTHER OR A LOVER
IT IS INDEED SAID DANGLARS IT IS A FINE THING TO HAVE SUCH CREDIT REALLY IT IS ONLY IN FRANCE THESE THINGS ARE DONE FIVE MILLIONS ON FIVE LITTLE SCRAPS OF PAPER IT MUST BE SEEN TO BE BELIEVED
HE WOULD HAVE INTERESTED HIMSELF SOMEWHAT MORE ABOUT IT STILL SAID CHATEAU RENAUD
THAT IF I DRAW OUT TEN MILLIONS ON THE SAME DAY IT WILL APPEAR RATHER STRANGE TO THE GOVERNOR TWO DAYS WILL BE A DIFFERENT THING SAID DANGLARS SMILING COME SAID BOVILLE WITH A TONE OF ENTIRE INCREDULITY FIVE MILLIONS TO THAT GENTLEMAN WHO JUST LEFT
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SAID MONTE CRISTO FIVE MILLIONS WHY WHAT A CROESUS YOU ARE THIS IS HOW I TRANSACT BUSINESS SAID DANGLARS IT IS REALLY WONDERFUL SAID THE COUNT ABOVE ALL
EVER SINCE THE FIRST MEETING OF ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT BILLY HAD BEEN SORELY TROUBLED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE SHE HAD AS SHE MOURNFULLY TOLD HERSELF
AND AGAIN AS BILLY THOUGHT OF IT BILLY'S HEART REJOICED
BESIDES WHEN I'M DOING THIS I'M NOT TELEPHONING YOU TO COME AND AMUSE ME
I WAS TOO WEAK AFTER IT I CRIED TO MY COMPANION AND IF YOU REACH THE PUMP ROOM TURN LOOSE ALL THE PUMPS IT IS THE ONLY CHANCE BARSOOM HAS TO EXIST TOMORROW FROM WHERE I LAY I OPENED THE SECOND DOOR
HE STOOPED AND KISSED THE WOMEN OF HIS FAMILY AND LAID HIS STRONG HAND UPON THE SHOULDERS OF THE MEN AS I TURNED SADLY FROM HIM MY EYES FELL UPON DEJAH THORIS HER HEAD WAS DROOPING UPON HER BREAST TO ALL APPEARANCES SHE WAS LIFELESS
HER VOICE WHEN SHE RESUMED CARRIED THE STERN NOTE SO FAMILIAR TO BILLY IN HER FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER AS I PRESUME MISTER ARKWRIGHT HAS TOLD YOU WE HAVE MET WITH MANY CHANGES IN OUR LIFE CHANGES WHICH NECESSITATED A NEW HOME AND A NEW MODE OF LIVING
AS IF HE WANTED KATE'S OPINION ON THAT OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT CONCERNED HIM AND BILLY ONCE TORN BY JEALOUSY AND EXASPERATED AT THE FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS OF THEIR QUIET HOURS TOGETHER HE HAD COMPLAINED OPENLY ACTUALLY BILLY IT'S WORSE THAN MARIE'S WEDDING HE DECLARED
HE REPLIED IF YOU OPEN QUICKLY I CAN LAST BUT A FEW MOMENTS MORE BUT IT IS USELESS THEY ARE BOTH DEAD AND NO ONE ELSE UPON BARSOOM KNEW THE SECRET OF THESE AWFUL LOCKS FOR THREE DAYS
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE CAUSE AND BERTRAM FEBRUARY CAME THE OPERETTA FOR WHICH BILLY WAS WORKING SO HARD WAS TO BE GIVEN THE TWENTIETH THE ART EXHIBITION FOR WHICH BERTRAM WAS PREPARING HIS FOUR PICTURES WAS TO OPEN THE SIXTEENTH
APPARELLED IN CELESTIAL LIGHT WEARING A GLORY AND A FRESHNESS NOT VISIBLE TO THOSE WHO LIKE HERSELF AND CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH LOOKED AT THINGS ONLY THROUGH PROSE WHEN'S THE WEDDING TO BE SHE ASKED AFTER A PAUSE THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST
I AM GLAD DIANA IS SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED BUT WHEN MY TURN COMES IF IT EVER DOES I DO HOPE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE THRILLING ABOUT IT BUT THEN DIANA THOUGHT SO TOO ONCE
BILLY LAUGHED BUT SHE FROWNED TOO I KNOW DEAR I DON'T LIKE THAT PART I WISH THEY WOULD LET ME ALONE WHEN I'M WITH YOU BUT AS FOR THE OPERETTA IT IS REALLY A GOOD THING DEAR AND YOU'LL SAY SO WHEN YOU SEE IT
WHEN THE DELICATE SHELL SHOULD BREAK VIVID IN MY MEMORY IS THE PICTURE OF THE LAST NIGHT AS WE SAT THERE TALKING IN LOW TONES OF THE STRANGE ROMANCE WHICH HAD WOVEN OUR LIVES TOGETHER AND OF THIS WONDER WHICH WAS COMING TO AUGMENT OUR HAPPINESS
THE NINE THOUGHT WAVES AT THAT AWFUL THING BEFORE ME THE MARTIAN HAD CRAWLED TO MY SIDE AND WITH STARING EYES FIXED ON THE SINGLE PANEL BEFORE US WE WAITED IN THE SILENCE OF DEATH SLOWLY
WE WENT OUR WAYS WITH SMILES UPON OUR FACES AND SORROW GNAWING AT OUR HEARTS
THUS HAD COME THE BREAKING OF WHATEVER TIE THERE WAS BETWEEN ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT NOT TO HAVE BROKEN IT WOULD HAVE MEANT FOR ALICE THE PLACING OF HERSELF IN A POSITION WHERE SOMETIME APOLOGIES MUST BE MADE FOR HER FATHER
MISTER ARKWRIGHT AND MISS GREGGORY BUT THEN THAT OF COURSE DID NOT SIGNIFY BILLY DECLARED TO HERSELF I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T EVER CALL HIM MARY JANE SHE SAID TO THE GIRL A LITTLE MISCHIEVOUSLY ONE DAY MARY JANE MISTER ARKWRIGHT NO I DON'T
WHICH WAS WITHHOLDING THE SPARK OF LIFE FROM THE INHABITANTS OF AN ENTIRE PLANET BESIDE THE DOOR A GREAT CREW OF MEN HAD BEEN LABORING TO PIERCE THE WALL BUT THEY HAD SCARCELY SCRATCHED THE FLINT LIKE SURFACE
NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THEM HOW THEY SHOULD DIE LET US GO ABOUT OUR DUTIES AS THOUGH A THOUSAND USEFUL YEARS STILL LAY BEFORE US THE CHAMBER RANG WITH APPLAUSE
WITH ARKWRIGHT AND HIS FRIENDS THE GREGGORYS SO MUCH THERE WERE THE NEW SONGS AND THE OPERETTA WITH ITS REHEARSALS AS A CAUSE FOR IT ALL AT THE SAME TIME DEEP WITHIN HIS FEARFUL SOUL WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ARKWRIGHT THE GREGGORYS AND THE OPERETTA WERE BUT
MISS GREGGORY LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE WHY IT'S SHE STOPPED SHORT HER EYES QUESTIONING WHY HASN'T HE EVER TOLD YOU SHE QUERIED BILLY LIFTED HER CHIN NO
MARILLA GLANCED AT THE RADIANT YOUNG FACE AND REFRAINED FROM FURTHER SARCASTIC COMMENTS PERHAPS SOME REALIZATION CAME TO HER THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE LIKE ANNE THE VISION AND THE FACULTY DIVINE THAT GIFT
MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE THOROUGHLY APPROVES OF THE MATCH AND THINKS ITS LIKELY MISS LAVENDAR WILL GIVE UP HER QUEER NOTIONS AND BE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE NOW THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE MARRIED
AND THERE WAS THE RAPTURE AND WRETCHEDNESS OF CHOOSING FASHIONS AND BEING FITTED ANNE AND DIANA SPENT HALF THEIR TIME AT ECHO LODGE AND THERE WERE NIGHTS WHEN ANNE COULD NOT SLEEP FOR WONDERING WHETHER SHE HAD DONE RIGHT IN ADVISING MISS LAVENDAR TO SELECT BROWN RATHER THAN NAVY BLUE FOR HER TRAVELING DRESS
EARNESTLY SOLICITOUS THAT IT SHOULD BE A SUCCESS SHE EVEN AS HE SOMETIMES HALF IRRITABLY REMEMBERED HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT SHE REALIZED HE BELONGED TO ART BEFORE HE DID TO HIMSELF AND WHEN HE HAD INDIGNANTLY DENIED THIS SHE HAD ONLY LAUGHED AND THROWN A KISS AT HIM
WAITING HAPPILY FOR THE SUMMER TO BRING LIFE AND LAUGHTER BACK TO IT AGAIN THERE WAS MORE ROMANCE IN THE WORLD THAN THAT WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF THE MIDDLE AGED LOVERS OF THE STONE HOUSE
THE PEOPLE SEEMED NEVER TO TIRE OF HEAPING HONORS UPON ME AND NO DAY PASSED THAT DID NOT BRING SOME NEW PROOF OF THEIR LOVE FOR MY PRINCESS THE INCOMPARABLE DEJAH THORIS
POETRY AND PROSE FOR THE NEXT MONTH ANNE LIVED IN WHAT FOR AVONLEA MIGHT BE CALLED A WHIRL OF EXCITEMENT THE PREPARATION OF HER OWN MODEST OUTFIT FOR REDMOND WAS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE
THEIR RUNNING ACROSS EACH OTHER LIKE THIS MISSUS GREGGORY SHE MURMURED AND THERE WAS A ROMANCE WASN'T THERE I HAVE JUST FELT IN MY BONES THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE BILLY HELD HER BREATH IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD MEANT TO SAY BUT NOW THAT SHE HAD SAID IT THE WORDS SEEMED
BESIDES FRED'S FATHER IS GOING TO BUY THE ABRAHAM FLETCHER FARM FOR HIM AND HE SAYS HE'S GOT TO HAVE IT TWO THIRDS PAID FOR
MUSIC MUSIC THE SPECTRE THAT FROM THE FIRST HAD DOGGED HIS FOOTSTEPS WITH BILLY'S BEHAVIOR TOWARD HIMSELF BERTRAM COULD FIND NO FAULT SHE WAS ALWAYS HER SWEET LOYAL LOVABLE SELF EAGER TO HEAR OF HIS WORK
HE'S VERY NICE AND JOLLY BUT HE'S JUST FRED WRIGHT IT IS ALWAYS A VERY PUZZLING QUESTION WHAT CAN SOMEBODY SEE IN SOMEBODY ELSE BUT HOW FORTUNATE AFTER ALL THAT IT IS SO FOR IF EVERYBODY SAW ALIKE WELL
AS THE AWE OF THE GRIM SHADOW OF DEATH CREPT OVER US EVEN WOOLA SEEMED TO FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE IMPENDING CALAMITY FOR HE PRESSED CLOSE TO DEJAH THORIS AND TO ME WHINING PITIFULLY
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN FROM JOY TO DEATH FOR TEN DAYS THE HORDES OF THARK AND THEIR WILD ALLIES WERE FEASTED AND ENTERTAINED AND THEN LOADED WITH COSTLY PRESENTS
THE NEXT TWO DAYS BROUGHT NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN THE SUPPLY OF AIR
CRIED ANNE REPENTANTLY I WAS ONLY TEASING YOU A BIT I THINK YOU'LL MAKE THE SWEETEST LITTLE HOUSEKEEPER IN THE WORLD AND I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY LOVELY OF YOU TO BE PLANNING ALREADY FOR YOUR HOME O'DREAMS
ARKWRIGHT AND ALICE GREGGORY HAD BEEN ALMOST LOVERS WHEN THE CHARGES AGAINST THE JUDGE'S HONOR HAD PLUNGED THE FAMILY INTO DESPAIRING HUMILIATION THEN HAD COME THE TIME WHEN ACCORDING TO ARKWRIGHT'S OWN STORY THE TWO WOMEN HAD SHUT THEMSELVES INDOORS REFUSED TO SEE THEIR FRIENDS AND LEFT TOWN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AS IF SOMEHOW DIANA HAD GONE FORWARD INTO A NEW WORLD SHUTTING A GATE BEHIND HER LEAVING ANNE ON THE OUTSIDE THINGS ARE CHANGING SO FAST IT ALMOST FRIGHTENS ME ANNE THOUGHT A LITTLE SADLY AND I'M AFRAID
SO YOU SEE SHE FINISHED WHEN ALICE GREGGORY HAD DONE LAUGHING OVER THE TALE
THEY STARTED ON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THEIR OWN LANDS THE JED OF LESSER HELIUM WITH A SMALL PARTY OF NOBLES ACCOMPANIED THEM ALL THE WAY TO THARK TO CEMENT MORE CLOSELY THE NEW BONDS OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
BUT AS THINGS SEEN ARE MIGHTIER THAN THINGS HEARD OR SUSPECTED THE REALIZATION THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY SO CAME TO HER WITH ALMOST THE SHOCK OF PERFECT SURPRISE THIS WAS SUCCEEDED BY A QUEER LITTLE LONELY FEELING
AND THEN THE THIRD AND AS I SAW THE HOPE OF BARSOOM CRAWLING
A MESSAGE CALLED ME TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER WHICH I FOUND FILLING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THAT BODY ON THE RAISED PLATFORM OF THE THRONE
NOW WHERE IS THE ROMANCE IN ALL THAT OH THERE ISN'T ANY WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY GASPED ANNE RATHER AS IF SOMEBODY HAD THROWN COLD WATER OVER HER I SUPPOSE THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS IN PROSE
I KNEW I COULD TRUST FATHER TO PICK ME OUT A NICE LITTLE SECOND MOTHER HE SAID PROUDLY IT'S A FINE THING TO HAVE A FATHER YOU CAN DEPEND ON TEACHER I JUST LOVE MISS LAVENDAR GRANDMA IS PLEASED TOO SHE SAYS SHE'S REAL GLAD FATHER DIDN'T PICK OUT AN AMERICAN FOR HIS SECOND WIFE BECAUSE
THIS ISN'T AN UNDERSTUDY LIKE MARIE'S WEDDING YOU KNOW SHE FINISHED DEMURELY THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT BERTRAM HAD BREATHED FERVENTLY BUT EVEN AS HE SAID THE WORDS HE GREW SICK WITH FEAR WHAT IF AFTER ALL THIS WERE AN UNDERSTUDY TO WHAT WAS TO COME LATER WHEN MUSIC
AS I PRESSED HER DEAR LIPS TO MINE THE OLD FEELING OF UNCONQUERABLE POWER AND AUTHORITY ROSE IN ME THE FIGHTING BLOOD OF VIRGINIA SPRANG TO LIFE IN MY VEINS IT SHALL NOT BE MY PRINCESS
BERTRAM HENSHAW IN THE STRATA WAS AS IT HAPPENED NOT FALLING ASLEEP HE WAS LYING BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE BERTRAM VERY FREQUENTLY LAY BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE THESE DAYS OR RATHER NIGHTS HE TOLD HIMSELF ON THESE OCCASIONS
AND WILL HAVE TO STAY ALL NIGHT SEVERAL TIMES PROBABLY YOU MISSUS GREGGORY
HIS RIVAL HAD REALLY CONQUERED BERTRAM KNEW THAT HOWEVER SECURE MIGHT SEEM BILLY'S AFFECTION FOR HIMSELF THERE WAS STILL IN HIS OWN MIND A HORRID FEAR LEST UNDERNEATH THAT SECURITY WERE AN UNCONSCIOUS
BILLY WENT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT MAKING PLANS FOR ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT TO BE THROWN TOGETHER NATURALLY JUST AS A MATTER OF COURSE YOU KNOW SHE SAID DROWSILY TO HERSELF ALL IN THE DARK SOME THREE OR FOUR MILES AWAY DOWN BEACON STREET AT THAT MOMENT
NATURALLY UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES OLD FRIENDS AND OLD ROMANCES MUST CHANGE TOO BUT MISSUS GREGGORY STAMMERED BILLY I'M SURE MISTER ARKWRIGHT WOULD WANT AN UP LIFTED HAND SILENCED HER PEREMPTORILY
DEJAH THORIS AND I WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY HAD COLLECTED IN A SUNKEN GARDEN WITHIN AN INNER COURTYARD OF THE PALACE WE CONVERSED IN LOW TONES WHEN WE CONVERSED AT ALL
MEN CRAZED WITH FEAR HAVE SURGED ABOUT THIS PORTAL IN VAIN ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE ITS MYSTERY I HAD NO TIME TO TALK I WAS BECOMING VERY WEAK AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I CONTROLLED MY MIND AT ALL BUT WITH A FINAL EFFORT AS I SANK WEAKLY TO MY KNEES I HURLED
THAT THE KEEPER OF THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT HAD MADE NO WIRELESS REPORT FOR TWO DAYS NOR HAD ALMOST CEASELESS CALLS UPON HIM FROM A SCORE OF CAPITALS ELICITED A SIGN OF RESPONSE THE AMBASSADORS OF THE OTHER NATIONS ASKED US TO TAKE THE MATTER IN HAND
HER EYES OPENED AND LOOKED INTO MINE KISS ME JOHN CARTER SHE MURMURED I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU IT IS CRUEL THAT WE MUST BE TORN APART WHO WERE JUST STARTING UPON
THE TWO WERE CIVILITY ITSELF TO EACH OTHER BUT VERY PLAINLY THEY WERE NOT AT EASE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY AND BILLY MUCH TO HER SURPRISE HAD TO ADMIT THAT ARKWRIGHT DID NOT APPEAR TO APPRECIATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW THAT HE HAD THEM THE PAIR CALLED EACH OTHER CEREMONIOUSLY
HE DID NOT WAIT TO QUESTION BUT IN AN INSTANT A GUARD WAS RACING TO THE NEAREST DOCK AND THOUGH THE AIR WAS THIN AND ALMOST GONE AT THE ROOFTOP THEY MANAGED TO LAUNCH THE FASTEST ONE MAN AIR SCOUT MACHINE THAT THE SKILL OF BARSOOM HAD EVER PRODUCED
THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN A YOUNG NOBLE AROSE
THAT BILLY'S BREATH DROPPED INTO A FLUTTERING SIGH AND HER CAUSE BECAME SUDDENLY IMPERTINENCE SPELLED IN BLACK CAPITALS THEN MISSUS GREGGORY SPOKE SLOWLY A LITTLE SADLY I DON'T MIND SAYING TO YOU THAT I DID HOPE
MISS LAVENDAR WAS GETTING READY TO BE MARRIED AND THE STONE HOUSE WAS THE SCENE OF ENDLESS CONSULTATIONS AND PLANNINGS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH HOVERING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THINGS IN AGITATED DELIGHT AND WONDER THEN THE DRESSMAKER CAME
AND WAS HAPPY WITH ALL THREE EXCEPT AT THE TIMES OF THE FUNERALS BUT I THINK SHE TOOK A RESK MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM OH IT'S ALL SO ROMANTIC BREATHED ANNE TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT
SOLA ALSO ACCOMPANIED TARS TARKAS HER FATHER WHO BEFORE ALL HIS CHIEFTAINS HAD ACKNOWLEDGED HER AS HIS DAUGHTER
NEVER MIND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOMETIME WHEN YOUR OWN TURN COMES BLESS YOU DEAREST OF DIANAS I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT IS AN IMAGINATION FOR IF NOT TO ENABLE YOU TO PEEP AT LIFE THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S EYES
AIN'T MISTER IRVING SPLENDID HE JUST WORSHIPS THE GROUND SHE TREADS ON AND IT MAKES ME FEEL SO QUEER SOMETIMES TO SEE THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE'S WATCHING HER IT BEGGARS DESCRIPTION MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM I'M AWFUL THANKFUL THEY'RE SO FOND OF EACH OTHER IT'S THE BEST WAY WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE
PROMISED ANNE SOLEMNLY OF COURSE IT WON'T BE FOR EVER SO LONG YET SAID DIANA BLUSHING THREE YEARS AT THE VERY LEAST FOR I'M ONLY EIGHTEEN AND MOTHER SAYS NO DAUGHTER OF HERS SHALL BE MARRIED BEFORE SHE'S TWENTY ONE
AND TOLD ANNE THE WHOLE STORY IN THE DUSKY SECLUSION OF THE EAST GABLE BOTH GIRLS CRIED AND KISSED AND LAUGHED I'M SO HAPPY SAID DIANA BUT IT DOES SEEM RIDICULOUS TO THINK OF ME BEING ENGAGED
DEAR MISS NEILSON LET US NOT TALK OF IT ANY MORE BEGGED MISSUS GREGGORY BROKENLY NO INDEED OF COURSE NOT CRIED BILLY BUT HER HEART REJOICED SHE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL NOW
THE TALL SLENDER KIND BUT SOMEHOW I WOULDN'T WANT FRED TO BE TALL AND SLENDER BECAUSE DON'T YOU SEE HE WOULDN'T BE FRED THEN OF COURSE ADDED DIANA RATHER DOLEFULLY WE WILL BE A DREADFULLY PUDGY COUPLE
AND FULFILL OUR HOPES IN THE DISTANCE WE SAW THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT OF AN APPROACHING AIRSHIP BUT WE ATTACHED NO SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO SO COMMON A SIGHT LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING IT RACED TOWARD HELIUM UNTIL ITS VERY SPEED
YES THE QUIETLY POLITE MONOSYLLABLE WAS NOT VERY ENCOURAGING TO BE SURE BUT BILLY SECURE IN HER CONVICTION THAT HER CAUSE WAS A RIGHTEOUS ONE REFUSED TO BE DAUNTED I THINK IT WAS SO ROMANTIC
PACING BACK AND FORTH WITH TENSE DRAWN FACE WHEN ALL WERE IN THEIR SEATS HE TURNED TOWARD US THIS MORNING HE SAID
WHICH THROUGH ALL ETERNITY MUST GO SWINGING THROUGH THE HEAVENS PEOPLED NOT EVEN BY MEMORIES IT IS THE END
EVERYBODY CONCERNED IN MISS LAVENDAR'S STORY WAS VERY HAPPY
CONDITIONS SEEMED MUCH WORSE HERE THAN AT HELIUM AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I BREATHED AT ALL THERE WERE A FEW MEN STILL CONSCIOUS AND TO ONE OF THESE I SPOKE IF I CAN OPEN THESE DOORS IS THERE A MAN WHO CAN START THE ENGINES I ASKED I CAN
REJOINED MISS GREGGORY WITH AN ODD SMILE THEN AFTER A MOMENT SHE ADDED I BELIEVE HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS USED TO HOWEVER YES I KNOW LAUGHED BILLY WE THOUGHT HE WAS A REAL MARY JANE ONCE AND SHE TOLD THE STORY OF HIS ARRIVAL
VERY FEARSOME INDEED TO SAY TO MISSUS GREGGORY THEN BILLY REMEMBERED HER CAUSE AND TOOK HEART BILLY WAS SPELLING IT NOW WITH A CAPITAL C FOR A LONG MINUTE MISSUS GREGGORY DID NOT ANSWER FOR SO LONG A MINUTE
ONE HAND WAS HELD BY FRED WHO STOOD WITH HIS FACE BENT TOWARD HER STAMMERING SOMETHING IN LOW EARNEST TONES THERE WERE NO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THEIR TWO SELVES AT THAT MAGIC MOMENT SO NEITHER OF THEM SAW ANNE WHO AFTER ONE
I CRIED THERE IS THERE MUST BE SOME WAY AND JOHN CARTER WHO HAS FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH A STRANGE WORLD FOR LOVE OF YOU WILL FIND IT AND WITH MY WORDS THERE CREPT ABOVE THE THRESHOLD OF MY CONSCIOUS MIND A SERIES OF
I DO NOT NEED TO TELL YOU WHAT THIS MEANS TO BARSOOM IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS TO PENETRATE THOSE MIGHTY WALLS IN FACT THE WORK HAS ALREADY COMMENCED AND THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO FEAR WERE THE ENGINE OF THE PUMPING PLANT TO RUN AS IT SHOULD
BESPOKE THE UNUSUAL FLASHING THE SIGNALS WHICH PROCLAIMED IT A DISPATCH BEARER FOR THE JEDDAK IT CIRCLED IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE TARDY PATROL BOAT WHICH MUST CONVOY IT TO THE PALACE DOCKS
THE FACE OF DEJAH THORIS HUNG ALWAYS BEFORE ME AS I TURNED FOR A LAST LOOK AS I LEFT THE PALACE GARDEN I HAD SEEN HER STAGGER AND SINK UPON THE GROUND BESIDE THE LITTLE INCUBATOR THAT SHE HAD DROPPED INTO THE LAST COMA WHICH WOULD END IN DEATH
I SANK UNCONSCIOUS
NOT NOW WAS THE CAUSE AN IMPERTINENCE IN TALL BLACK LETTERS IT WAS INSTEAD A SHINING BEACON IN LETTERS OF FLAME GUIDING STRAIGHT TO VICTORY
BUT EVEN SO IT'S NICE TO THINK ONE WAS AN INSTRUMENT USED BY PREDESTINATION YES INDEED IT'S VERY ROMANTIC I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S SO TERRIBLY ROMANTIC AT ALL SAID MARILLA RATHER CRISPLY
WITH A PRIVATE VIEW FOR SPECIALLY INVITED FRIENDS THE EVENING BEFORE ON THE ELEVENTH DAY OF FEBRUARY MISSUS GREGGORY AND HER DAUGHTER ARRIVED AT HILLSIDE FOR A TEN DAYS VISIT NOT UNTIL AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF PLEADING AND ARGUMENT HOWEVER HAD BILLY BEEN ABLE TO BRING THIS ABOUT
THAT ALL DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE ENGAGED TO ANSWERED DIANA WITH THAT
IF IT ISN'T METHUSELAH JOHN WHAT IS IT THEN BUT ALICE GREGGORY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE TOO IT SEEMED COULD BE FIRM ON OCCASION AND THOUGH SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY ALL SHE WOULD SAY WAS IF HE HASN'T TOLD YOU I SHA'N'T YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO HIM
MARILLA THOUGHT ANNE WAS TOO WORKED UP ABOUT IT AND HAD PLENTY TO DO WITH GETTING READY FOR COLLEGE WITHOUT TRAIPSING TO ECHO LODGE TWO DAYS OUT OF THREE HELPING MISS LAVENDAR
ANNE STUMBLED SUDDENLY ON IT ONE EVENING WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO ORCHARD SLOPE BY THE WOOD CUT AND CAME OUT INTO THE BARRY GARDEN DIANA BARRY AND FRED WRIGHT WERE STANDING TOGETHER UNDER THE BIG WILLOW DIANA WAS LEANING AGAINST THE GRAY TRUNK HER LASHES CAST DOWN ON VERY CRIMSON CHEEKS
METHUSELAH JOHN BUT HE SAYS WE HAVEN'T HIT IT YET METHUSELAH JOHN INDEED LAUGHED THE OTHER MERRILY
PUSHING THE SPEED LEVER TO ITS LAST NOTCH I SPLIT THE THIN AIR OF DYING MARS WITH THE SPEED OF A METEOR AN HOUR BEFORE DARK THE GREAT WALLS OF THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT LOOMED SUDDENLY BEFORE ME AND WITH A SICKENING
ONCE THAT THERE WOULD BE A ROMANCE THERE THEY WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS AND THEY WERE WELL SUITED TO EACH OTHER IN TASTES AND TEMPERAMENT I THINK INDEED THAT THE ROMANCE WAS WELL UNDER WAY THOUGH THERE WAS NEVER AN ENGAGEMENT WHEN MISSUS GREGGORY PAUSED AND WET HER LIPS
ANNE HAD NO SOONER UTTERED THE PHRASE HOME O'DREAMS THAN IT CAPTIVATED HER FANCY AND SHE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THE ERECTION OF ONE OF HER OWN IT WAS OF COURSE TENANTED BY AN IDEAL MASTER DARK PROUD AND MELANCHOLY
MISTER ARKWRIGHT WAS VERY KIND AND A GENTLEMAN ALWAYS INTERPOSED THE LADY COLDLY BUT JUDGE GREGGORY'S DAUGHTER WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO BE PLACED WHERE APOLOGIES FOR HER FATHER WOULD BE NECESSARY EVER THERE PLEASE
IF THE AIR SUPPLY REMAINED UNREPLENISHED I WELL KNEW AND SO THROWING CAUTION TO THE WINDS I FLUNG OVERBOARD EVERYTHING BUT THE ENGINE AND COMPASS
AND HASTEN THE ASSISTANT KEEPER TO THE PLANT ALL DAY A THOUSAND CRUISERS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR HIM UNTIL JUST NOW ONE OF THEM RETURNS BEARING HIS DEAD BODY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE PITS BENEATH HIS HOUSE HORRIBLY MUTILATED BY SOME ASSASSIN
LAY A SNOW WHITE EGG FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS TEN SOLDIERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD HAD CONSTANTLY STOOD OVER IT AND NOT A DAY PASSED WHEN I WAS IN THE CITY THAT DEJAH THORIS AND I DID NOT STAND HAND IN HAND BEFORE OUR LITTLE SHRINE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE
OR FAR WORSE STILL WITH OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN IT
TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY MANY OF THE WEAKER COMMENCED TO SUCCUMB AND WITHIN AN HOUR THE PEOPLE OF BARSOOM WERE SINKING BY THOUSANDS INTO THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS WHICH PRECEDES DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION
RETURNED UPON A BATTLESHIP THAT HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO THARK TO FETCH THEM IN TIME FOR THE CEREMONY WHICH MADE DEJAH
ALL BARSOOM I HAD TO FLY LOW TO GET SUFFICIENT AIR TO BREATHE BUT I TOOK A STRAIGHT COURSE ACROSS AN OLD SEA BOTTOM AND SO HAD TO RISE ONLY A FEW FEET ABOVE THE GROUND I TRAVELED WITH AWFUL VELOCITY FOR MY ERRAND WAS A RACE AGAINST TIME WITH DEATH
THE AVENUES AND PLAZAS OF HELIUM WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE ALL BUSINESS HAD CEASED FOR THE MOST PART THE PEOPLE LOOKED BRAVELY INTO THE FACE OF THEIR UNALTERABLE DOOM HERE AND THERE HOWEVER MEN AND WOMEN GAVE WAY TO QUIET GRIEF
OH WELL I CAN STILL CALL HIM MARY JANE RETORTED BILLY WITH AIRY DISDAIN ALL THIS HOWEVER SO FAR AS BILLY COULD SEE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST HELPING ALONG THE CAUSE THAT HAD BECOME SO DEAR TO HER
SOME ONE THAT HE WAS NOT A FONDNESS THAT WOULD ONE DAY CAUSE BILLY TO AWAKE
IT HAD BEEN THE GREAT GOOD AND PLEASURE WHICH THE VISIT WOULD BRING TO MISSUS GREGGORY THAT HAD BEEN THE FINAL STRAW TO TIP THE SCALES ON THE ELEVENTH OF FEBRUARY THEREFORE IN THE COMPANY OF THE ONCE SCORNED PEGGY AND MARY JANE ALICE GREGGORY AND HER MOTHER HAD ARRIVED AT HILLSIDE
BANISH GILBERT'S IMAGE FROM HER CASTLE IN SPAIN BUT SOMEHOW HE WENT ON BEING THERE SO ANNE BEING IN A HURRY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT AND PURSUED HER AERIAL ARCHITECTURE WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT HER HOME O'DREAMS WAS BUILT AND FURNISHED BEFORE DIANA SPOKE AGAIN
AVOWED BERTRAM BUT THE WORK MAY RETORTED BILLY SHOWING ALL HER DIMPLES
DID SHE NOT HAVE IT IN HER POWER POSSIBLY EVEN PROBABLY TO BRING HAPPINESS WHERE ONLY SADNESS WAS BEFORE AS IF IT WOULD NOT BE A SIMPLE THING TO REKINDLE THE OLD FLAME TO MAKE THESE TWO ESTRANGED HEARTS BEAT AS ONE AGAIN
THERE'S NOT MUCH COMFORT FOR THE REST OF US IN THAT SEEING THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE FRED LAUGHED ANNE OH ANNE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID DIANA IN VEXATION I DIDN'T MEAN THAT IT'S SO HARD TO EXPLAIN
THAT THIS CAN'T HELP MAKING SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIANA AND ME I'M SURE I CAN'T TELL HER ALL MY SECRETS AFTER THIS SHE MIGHT TELL FRED AND
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP HOUSE WITH ONLY THIRTY SIX DOILIES CONCEDED ANNE WITH A SOLEMN FACE BUT DANCING EYES DIANA LOOKED HURT I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D MAKE FUN OF ME ANNE SHE SAID REPROACHFULLY DEAREST I WASN'T MAKING FUN OF YOU
YOU MUST BE MY BRIDESMAID YOU KNOW ANNE PROMISE ME THAT WHEREVER YOU MAY BE WHEN I'M MARRIED
BUT THE WORST WE FEAR HAS HAPPENED THE INSTRUMENTS SHOW A RAPIDLY DECREASING AIR PRESSURE ON ALL PARTS OF BARSOOM THE ENGINE HAS STOPPED MY GENTLEMEN HE CONCLUDED WE HAVE AT BEST THREE DAYS TO LIVE
HELPING HER ARRANGE PICTURES LAY OUT GARDENS AND ACCOMPLISH SUNDRY OTHER TASKS WHICH A PROUD AND MELANCHOLY HERO EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED BENEATH HIS DIGNITY ANNE TRIED TO
DAZED GLANCE OF COMPREHENSION TURNED AND SPED NOISELESSLY BACK THROUGH THE SPRUCE WOOD NEVER STOPPING TILL SHE GAINED HER OWN GABLE ROOM WHERE SHE SAT BREATHLESSLY DOWN BY HER WINDOW AND TRIED TO COLLECT HER SCATTERED WITS DIANA AND FRED ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
SHE GASPED OH IT DOES SEEM SO SO SO HOPELESSLY GROWN UP ANNE OF LATE HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT HER SUSPICIONS THAT DIANA WAS PROVING FALSE TO THE MELANCHOLY BYRONIC HERO OF HER EARLY DREAMS
SO I TOLD HER ALL THAT I HAD HEARD WE HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY JOHN CARTER SHE SAID AND I THANK WHATEVER FATE OVERTAKES US THAT IT PERMITS US TO DIE TOGETHER
MARILLA THAT IS ROMANTIC EVEN IN PROSE THERE'S TO BE NOBODY THERE EXCEPT MISSUS IRVING AND PAUL AND GILBERT AND DIANA AND I AND MISS LAVENDAR'S COUSINS
SHE WAS AND NEVER ASKED ANYBODY ANYTHING ABOUT HER AND NOW EVERYTHING HAS COME RIGHT AND I HAD A HAND IN BRINGING IT ABOUT PERHAPS AS MISSUS LYNDE SAYS
BUT MY DEARS BOTH OF YOU BILLY HAD AT LAST SAID TO THEM JUST LISTEN WE SHALL HAVE
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGH POETRY AND I THINK IT'S NICER ANNE RECOVERED HERSELF AND HER EYES SHONE AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHED
I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE MY PART IS ONLY A SMALL ONE YOU KNOW WE SHALL MAKE LOTS OF MONEY FOR THE HOME TOO I'M SURE BUT YOU'RE WEARING YOURSELF ALL OUT WITH IT DEAR SCOWLED BERTRAM
AND MEANT TO MAKE HER APOLOGY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CATHERINE'S MIND WAS GREATLY EASED BY THIS INFORMATION YET A SOMETHING OF SOLICITUDE REMAINED FROM WHICH SPRANG THE FOLLOWING QUESTION THOROUGHLY ARTLESS IN ITSELF THOUGH RATHER DISTRESSING TO THE GENTLEMAN BUT MISTER TILNEY
THE POOR MAN MEANT IT AS A COMPLIMENT BUT FELICITY WHO KNEW UNCLE BLAIR WAS AN ARTIST AND HAD A POOR OPINION OF SUCH FRY LOOKED INDIGNANT AND RETORTED INDEED SHE WASN'T
PAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING EVER KNEW AND I VOW PADDY WOULD LICK HIS CHOPS WITH DELIGHT BUT TO BE CALLED A SWEET CAT OH SARA SARA
THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE GIFT FROM HER SISTER ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF
THE STORY GIRL WOULD BOX HIS EARS WITH HER FIST AND SAY BLESS YOUR GRAY HEART PADDY YOU'RE A GOOD SORT OF OLD RASCAL AND PAT WOULD PURR HIS SATISFACTION I USED TO TAKE A HANDFUL OF THE SKIN ON HIS BACK SHAKE HIM GENTLY AND SAY
MISSUS ALLEN SAID CATHERINE THE NEXT MORNING WILL THERE BE ANY HARM IN MY CALLING ON MISS TILNEY TODAY I SHALL NOT BE EASY TILL I HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING GO BY ALL MEANS MY DEAR ONLY PUT ON A WHITE GOWN MISS TILNEY ALWAYS WEARS WHITE
TRIPPING LIGHTLY THROUGH THE CHURCH YARD AND RESOLUTELY TURNING AWAY HER EYES THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO SEE HER BELOVED ISABELLA AND HER DEAR FAMILY WHO SHE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE WERE IN A SHOP HARD BY SHE REACHED THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT LOOKED AT THE NUMBER
DON'T CRIED CECILY HYSTERICALLY DON'T YOU GO ON DON'T YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD I CAN'T BEAR IT DON'T YOU THE STORY GIRL DIDN'T BUT SHE HAD SAID ENOUGH
TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD AND IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MISSUS DASHWOOD HIS HAND PASSED SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER AS TO MAKE A RING WITH A PLAIT OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS
FELICITY TRIED AND HAD THE MOST GRATIFYING LUCK WITH A NEW AND COMPLICATED CAKE RECIPE A GORGEOUS COMPOUND
ELINOR SAW WITH GREAT UNEASINESS THE LOW SPIRITS OF HER FRIEND HIS VISIT AFFORDED HER BUT A VERY PARTIAL SATISFACTION
I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
HE STRUGGLED OUT OF MY CLASP AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE LONG GRASSES WITH SOUNDLESS LEAPS
I DO NOT LIKE RUINED TATTERED COTTAGES I AM NOT FOND OF NETTLES OR THISTLES OR HEATH BLOSSOMS I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN A SNUG FARM HOUSE THAN A WATCH TOWER
I KNOW HE'LL LAUGH AT US AWFUL BUT IT'S BETTER TO BE LAUGHED AT THAN SCARED LIKE THIS UNCLE ROGER DID NOT COME UNTIL NEARLY TEN NEVER WAS THERE A MORE WELCOME SOUND THAN THE RUMBLE OF HIS WHEELS IN THE LANE
IT DON'T SOUND A BIT LIKE OTHER CLOCKS
EVERY OTHER LOOK UPON AN AVERAGE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE BOX AND FOR THE SPACE OF TWO ENTIRE SCENES DID SHE THUS WATCH HENRY TILNEY WITHOUT BEING ONCE ABLE TO CATCH HIS EYE NO LONGER COULD HE BE SUSPECTED OF INDIFFERENCE FOR A PLAY
IS BECOME A MERE JARGON EVERY BODY PRETENDS TO FEEL AND TRIES TO DESCRIBE WITH THE TASTE AND ELEGANCE OF HIM WHO FIRST DEFINED WHAT PICTURESQUE BEAUTY WAS I DETEST JARGON OF EVERY KIND AND SOMETIMES I HAVE KEPT MY FEELINGS TO MYSELF
BUT HITHERTO THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS PREFERENCE SEEMED VERY UNCERTAIN AND THE RESERVEDNESS OF HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER CONTRADICTED ONE MOMENT WHAT A MORE ANIMATED LOOK HAD INTIMATED THE PRECEDING ONE
AND THE PRECINCTS OF A POSSIBLY ENCHANTED SPRING WHEN WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE ORCHARD AND ENTERED IT THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE IT WAS THE MAGICAL MYSTICAL TIME OF BETWEEN LIGHTS OFF TO THE WEST WAS A DAFFODIL GLOW HANGING OVER THE VALLEY OF LOST SUNSETS
SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR HOWEVER TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE INTERNALLY RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF BEYOND ALL DOUBT
ALL AT ONCE SOMETHING LEAPED FROM THE BOUGH OF A TREE AND ALIGHTED BEFORE US WE SPLIT THE AIR WITH A SIMULTANEOUS SHRIEK
CATHERINE CHEERFULLY COMPLIED AND BEING PROPERLY EQUIPPED WAS MORE IMPATIENT THAN EVER TO BE AT THE PUMP ROOM THAT SHE MIGHT INFORM HERSELF OF GENERAL TILNEY'S LODGINGS FOR THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE
WITH A HIGHWAYMAN ON A MOONLIT HEATH AND BUSKIRK'S GIRL WHO JOINED THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF TEMPERANCE JUST TO SEE WHAT WAS INTO IT AND IN EACH IMPERSONATION SHE WAS SO THOROUGHLY THE THING IMPERSONATED
AND DEPENDENCE ON CATHERINE'S HONOUR OH DO NOT SAY MISS TILNEY WAS NOT ANGRY CRIED CATHERINE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WAS FOR SHE WOULD NOT SEE ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CALLED I SAW HER WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT MINUTE AFTER MY LEAVING IT I WAS HURT BUT I WAS NOT AFFRONTED
AND HE REPLIED IN A TONE WHICH RETAINED ONLY A LITTLE AFFECTED RESERVE WE WERE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AT ANY RATE FOR WISHING US A PLEASANT WALK AFTER OUR PASSING YOU IN ARGYLE STREET YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO LOOK BACK ON PURPOSE
THERE WE STOOD IN A HUDDLED DEMORALIZED GROUP OH WHAT AN EERIE PLACE THAT ORCHARD WAS WHAT SHADOWS WHAT NOISES
WAS ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL TILNEY
HE STRODE ALONG RIGHT MASTERFULLY AND LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO WAS MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYED THE STORY GIRL KISSED HER FINGERTIPS TO HIM WITH THE DELIGHTFUL AUDACITY WHICH WAS A PART OF HER
HE COLOURED VERY DEEPLY AND GIVING A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT ELINOR REPLIED YES IT IS MY SISTER'S HAIR THE SETTING ALWAYS CASTS A DIFFERENT SHADE ON IT YOU KNOW ELINOR HAD MET HIS EYE AND LOOKED CONSCIOUS LIKEWISE
CECILY AND SARA RAY FOUND A SWEET NEW KNITTED LACE PATTERN IN AN OLD MAGAZINE
BUT IN RETURN YOUR SISTER MUST ALLOW ME TO FEEL NO MORE THAN I PROFESS I LIKE A FINE PROSPECT BUT NOT ON PICTURESQUE PRINCIPLES I DO NOT LIKE CROOKED TWISTED BLASTED TREES I ADMIRE THEM MUCH MORE IF THEY ARE TALL STRAIGHT AND FLOURISHING
THEY AND ONLY THEY CAN BRING US TIDINGS FROM THAT DEAR COUNTRY WHERE WE ONCE SOJOURNED AND FROM WHICH WE MUST EVERMORE BE EXILES THE WORLD CALLS THEM ITS SINGERS AND POETS AND ARTISTS AND STORY TELLERS
AND I GOT BACK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO I SET DOWN ON THE FRONT DOOR STEPS FOR A MOMENT AND ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A BELL RING IN THE HOUSE EIGHT TIMES I TELL YOU I WAS SKEERED I MADE A BOLT FOR THE ORCHARD AND YOU WON'T CATCH ME GOING NEAR THAT HOUSE TILL YOUR UNCLE ROGER COMES HOME
ONE BITTER DAY WHEN THEY SEEK IT
HOPE I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE HIM
NO IT ISN'T PEG BOWEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WALKS I KNOW A STORY ABOUT A GHOST SAID THE STORY GIRL THE RULING PASSION STRONG EVEN IN EXTREMITY IT IS ABOUT A GHOST WITH EYEHOLES BUT NO EYES
AND PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE NOW COMING ROUND TO THEIR BOX SHE WAS RIGHT IN A FEW MINUTES HE APPEARED
THE ODDS WERE FIVE TO FOUR AGAINST ME AND IF I HAD NOT MADE ONE OF THE CLEANEST STROKES THAT PERHAPS EVER WAS MADE IN THIS WORLD I TOOK HIS BALL EXACTLY BUT I COULD NOT MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND IT WITHOUT A TABLE HOWEVER I DID BEAT HIM A VERY FINE FELLOW AS RICH AS A JEW
A PRETTY WALK THROUGH A WORLD OF GREEN WHISPERING BOUGHS AND SPICE SWEET FERNS AND SHIFTING PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RASPBERRIES WERE PLENTIFUL
HIS NOTICE WAS NEVER WITHDRAWN FROM THE STAGE DURING TWO WHOLE SCENES
AND WITH A LOOK WHICH DID NOT QUITE CONFIRM HIS WORDS SAID HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN FOR THAT MISS TILNEY WAS WALKED OUT CATHERINE WITH A BLUSH OF MORTIFICATION LEFT THE HOUSE SHE FELT ALMOST PERSUADED THAT MISS TILNEY WAS AT HOME AND TOO MUCH OFFENDED TO ADMIT HER
BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
WAS WHITE AND CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPRUCES WE WERE WOEFULLY TIRED BUT WE COULD NOT SIT DOWN BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS REEKING WITH DEW THE FAMILY GHOST ONLY APPEARS IN DAYLIGHT SAID THE STORY GIRL
THE NUMBER OF EGGS SHE USED IN IT WOULD HAVE SHOCKED AUNT JANET'S THRIFTY SOUL BUT THAT CAKE LIKE BEAUTY WAS ITS OWN EXCUSE UNCLE ROGER ATE THREE SLICES OF IT AT TEA TIME AND TOLD FELICITY SHE WAS AN ARTIST
THEN WE FOREGATHERED AROUND A TINY WOOD SPRING COLD AND PELLUCID UNDER ITS YOUNG MAPLES AND ATE THE JELLY COOKIES AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US A TALE OF A HAUNTED SPRING IN A MOUNTAIN GLEN WHERE A FAIR WHITE LADY DWELT
HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN AND MARIANNE WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR AS SHE COULD SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES BUT BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN
NAY I AM SURE BY YOUR LOOK WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE BOX YOU WERE ANGRY I ANGRY I COULD HAVE NO RIGHT WELL NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD NO RIGHT WHO SAW YOUR FACE HE REPLIED BY ASKING HER TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM AND TALKING OF THE PLAY HE REMAINED WITH THEM SOME TIME
AND WAS ONLY TOO AGREEABLE FOR CATHERINE TO BE CONTENTED WHEN HE WENT AWAY BEFORE THEY PARTED HOWEVER IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PROJECTED WALK SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SETTING ASIDE THE MISERY OF HIS QUITTING THEIR BOX
WHEN THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS OVER THORPE CAME TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING OUT CATHERINE WAS THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF HIS GALLANTRY AND WHILE THEY WAITED IN THE LOBBY FOR A CHAIR HE PREVENTED THE INQUIRY WHICH HAD TRAVELLED FROM HER HEART ALMOST TO THE TIP OF HER TONGUE BY ASKING
HE WAS A STRANGE FURTIVE ANIMAL A QUESTING BEAST PRESENTLY THE MOON ROSE BUT THIS ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE THE SHADOWS HAD BEEN STILL BEFORE NOW THEY MOVED AND DANCED AS THE NIGHT WIND TOSSED THE BOUGHS THE OLD HOUSE WITH ITS DREADFUL SECRET
THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT IN THIS WE WERE ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF PEG BOWEN AS WE WOULD BE OF ANY SPECTRAL VISITANT PETER SCOFFED AT THE IDEA PEG BOWEN WASN'T IN THE HOUSE BEFORE YOUR UNCLE ROGER LOCKED IT UP AND HOW COULD SHE GET IN AFTERWARDS HE SAID
IN A CONSEQUENTIAL MANNER WHETHER SHE HAD SEEN HIM TALKING WITH GENERAL TILNEY HE IS A FINE OLD FELLOW UPON MY SOUL STOUT ACTIVE LOOKS AS YOUNG AS HIS SON I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM I ASSURE YOU
I WOULD HAVE JUMPED OUT AND RUN AFTER YOU IS THERE A HENRY IN THE WORLD WHO COULD BE INSENSIBLE TO SUCH A DECLARATION HENRY TILNEY AT LEAST WAS NOT WITH A YET SWEETER SMILE HE SAID EVERYTHING THAT NEED BE SAID OF HIS SISTER'S CONCERN REGRET
I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WOULDN'T MIND IF HE'D LAUGH ONCE AND HAVE IT DONE WITH IT
YOU'D UNDERSTAND WHY IF YOU EVER SAW HIM AT A PARTY OR A PICNIC SAID FELICITY TRYING TO PASS PLATES AND DROPPING THEM WHENEVER A WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM THEY SAY IT'S PITIFUL TO SEE HIM I MUST GET WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THAT MAN NEXT SUMMER SAID THE STORY GIRL
THAT'S ONLY MY OLD APRON SAID FELICITY I HUNG IT THERE TO DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR THE WHITE HEN'S NEST OH WHAT SHALL WE DO UNCLE ROGER MAY NOT BE BACK FOR HOURS I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE MAYBE IT'S ONLY PEG BOWEN SUGGESTED DAN
THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED MARIANNE'S ATTENTION AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES
WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN HONESTLY GIVE I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY
AND IS DISGUSTED WITH SUCH PRETENSIONS HE AFFECTS GREATER INDIFFERENCE AND LESS DISCRIMINATION IN VIEWING THEM HIMSELF THAN HE POSSESSES HE IS FASTIDIOUS AND WILL HAVE AN AFFECTATION OF HIS OWN IT IS VERY TRUE SAID MARIANNE THAT ADMIRATION OF LANDSCAPE SCENERY
BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED
OR AT LEAST OF ITS APPEARANCE AND WAS ONLY EAGER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING ITS CAUSE THE PLAY CONCLUDED THE CURTAIN FELL HENRY TILNEY WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO SAT BUT HIS FATHER REMAINED
WHAT YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL CRIED SIR JOHN THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN THIS AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS TO EDWARD
WHO PLEDGED ALL COMERS IN A GOLDEN CUP WITH JEWELS BRIGHT AND IF YOU DRANK OF THE CUP WITH HER SAID THE STORY GIRL HER EYES GLOWING THROUGH THE EMERALD DUSK ABOUT US YOU WERE NEVER SEEN IN THE WORLD AGAIN YOU WERE WHISKED STRAIGHTWAY TO FAIRYLAND AND LIVED THERE WITH A FAIRY BRIDE
BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER HAIR HAD BEEN DARKER MARIANNE SPOKE INCONSIDERATELY WHAT SHE REALLY FELT BUT WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH SHE HAD PAINED EDWARD HER OWN VEXATION AT HER WANT OF THOUGHT COULD NOT BE SURPASSED BY HIS
AS SHE POINTED THEM OUT TO HER COMPANION HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT HIS FATHER LIKE EVERY MILITARY MAN
WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL UNCLE ROGER STOPPED LAUGHING BEFORE WE HEARD THE EXPLANATION WE THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD STOP
PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW I HAD BEEN THERE I WAS NOT WITHIN AT THE TIME BUT I HEARD OF IT FROM ELEANOR AND SHE HAS BEEN WISHING EVER SINCE TO SEE YOU TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF SUCH INCIVILITY BUT PERHAPS I CAN DO IT AS WELL IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT MY FATHER
IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
TO THE THEATRE ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL WENT NO TILNEYS APPEARED TO PLAGUE OR PLEASE HER SHE FEARED THAT AMONGST THE MANY PERFECTIONS OF THE FAMILY A FONDNESS FOR PLAYS WAS NOT TO BE RANKED BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE HABITUATED TO THE FINER PERFORMANCES OF THE LONDON STAGE
WHY WERE YOU LESS GENEROUS THAN YOUR SISTER IF SHE FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE IN MY GOOD INTENTIONS AND COULD SUPPOSE IT TO BE ONLY A MISTAKE WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO READY TO TAKE OFFENCE ME I TAKE OFFENCE
CHANCING ACCIDENTALLY I VOW TO OVERHEAR CERTAIN OF THESE SECRETS I LEARNED THAT SARA RAY HAD NAMED AN APPLE FOR JOHNNY PRICE AND CECILY TRUE'S YOU LIVE THERE WAS EIGHT SEEDS IN IT AND YOU KNOW EIGHT MEANS THEY BOTH LOVE
WELL HERE'S THE KEY GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF SAID PETER FELICITY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AND SEEING I THINK YOU BOYS OUGHT TO GO SHE SAID RETREATING BEHIND THE DEFENCE OF SEX YOU OUGHT TO BE BRAVER THAN GIRLS
MARIANNE LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT EDWARD WITH COMPASSION AT HER SISTER
AND NOW IT HAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED YOU POOR LITTLE MONKEYS TO DEATH WE HEARD UNCLE ROGER CHUCKLING ALL THE WAY TO THE BARN
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHALL I TELL YOU CERTAINLY WELL THEN I GUESS THAT MISTER WILLOUGHBY HUNTS MARIANNE WAS SURPRISED AND CONFUSED YET SHE COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE QUIET ARCHNESS OF HIS MANNER AND AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE SAID
BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING I AM CONVINCED SAID EDWARD THAT YOU REALLY FEEL ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS TO FEEL
KING'S GHOST WHISPERED FELIX SHE NEVER APPEARED ANYWHERE BUT IN THE ORCHARD SAID THE STORY GIRL OH OH CHILDREN ISN'T THERE SOMETHING UNDER UNCLE ALEC'S TREE WE PEERED FEARFULLY THROUGH THE GLOOM THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT WAVERED AND FLUTTERED ADVANCED RETREATED
MY DEAR YOU TUMBLE MY GOWN WAS MISSUS ALLEN'S REPLY HER ASSURANCE HOWEVER STANDING SOLE AS IT DID WAS NOT THROWN AWAY IT BROUGHT A MORE CORDIAL MORE NATURAL SMILE INTO HIS COUNTENANCE
ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH HOWEVER THE SUDDEN VIEW OF MISTER HENRY TILNEY AND HIS FATHER JOINING A PARTY IN THE OPPOSITE BOX RECALLED HER TO ANXIETY AND DISTRESS THE STAGE COULD NO LONGER EXCITE GENUINE MERRIMENT NO LONGER KEEP HER WHOLE ATTENTION
WHAT COULD THEY HAVE TO SAY OF HER SHE FEARED GENERAL TILNEY DID NOT LIKE HER APPEARANCE SHE FOUND IT WAS IMPLIED IN HIS PREVENTING HER ADMITTANCE TO HIS DAUGHTER RATHER THAN POSTPONE HIS OWN WALK A FEW MINUTES HOW CAME MISTER THORPE TO KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS HER ANXIOUS INQUIRY
FOR SHE SOON RECOLLECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR STAYING AT HOME AND IN THE SECOND
AS WE SAT THERE THE AWKWARD MAN PASSED BY WITH HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS DOG AT HIS SIDE HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN AWKWARD MAN THERE IN THE HEART OF THE MAPLE WOODS
UNCLE ROGER UNLOCKED AND FLUNG OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AS HE DID SO CLEAR AND SWEET RANG OUT TEN BELL LIKE CHIMES
LOWERING HIS VOICE WELL DONE GENERAL SAID I I AM QUITE OF YOUR MIND
CECILY HOW OLD MUST WE BE BEFORE WE CAN HAVE A REAL BEAU BUT SARA ALWAYS DENIED IT SO I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE FELIX SIMPLY MADE IT UP HIMSELF PADDY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY CATCHING A RAT
TO WHAT A DEGREE OF UNFORGIVINGNESS IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY LEAD NOR TO WHAT RIGOURS OF RUDENESS IN RETURN IT MIGHT JUSTLY MAKE HER AMENABLE DEJECTED AND HUMBLED SHE HAD EVEN SOME THOUGHTS OF NOT GOING WITH THE OTHERS TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT
AND BEING INTOLERABLY CONCEITED ABOUT IT UNTIL SARA RAY CURED HIM BY CALLING HIM A DEAR SWEET CAT AND KISSING HIM BETWEEN THE EARS THEN PAT SNEAKED ABJECTLY OFF HIS TAIL DROOPING
THAT THE NAME OF FERRARS BEGAN WITH AN F AND THIS PREPARED A FUTURE MINE OF RAILLERY AGAINST THE DEVOTED ELINOR WHICH NOTHING BUT THE NEWNESS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH EDWARD COULD HAVE PREVENTED FROM BEING IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG
I SHALL TELL IT TOO I DON'T CARE IF THE JOKE IS AS MUCH ON MYSELF AS ANY ONE A STORY IS A STORY NO MATTER WHO IT'S ON BUT IT IS HATEFUL TO BE LAUGHED AT AND GROWN UPS ALWAYS DO IT I NEVER WILL WHEN I'M GROWN UP I'LL REMEMBER BETTER
SHE WAS UPON THE WHOLE LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER TELL YOU WHO ALICE IS I ASKED I HAVE A NOTION WHO ALICE IS ALREADY SAID THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURE BUT SHE WOULD TELL US NOTHING MORE WHEN THE JELLY COOKIES WERE ALL EATEN IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MOVING HOMEWARD
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THE STORY GIRL HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A BELL WHEN I HEARD IT AND THE DOOR OPEN TOO LET US BE FAIR FELICITY
CATHERINE IN DEEP MORTIFICATION PROCEEDED ON HER WAY SHE COULD ALMOST BE ANGRY HERSELF AT SUCH ANGRY INCIVILITY BUT SHE CHECKED THE RESENTFUL SENSATION SHE REMEMBERED HER OWN IGNORANCE SHE KNEW NOT HOW SUCH AN OFFENCE AS HERS MIGHT BE CLASSED BY THE LAWS OF WORLDLY POLITENESS
AND HE BEING HURRIED FOR TIME AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF MADE A POINT OF HER BEING DENIED THAT WAS ALL I DO ASSURE YOU
BUT AS IT WAS SHE ONLY LEARNED FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS HOW FAR THEIR PENETRATION FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS EXTENDED SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY OR TO DRINK TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING
VERY FEW CATS HAVE AND MOST OF THEM HAVE SUCH AN INORDINATE APPETITE FOR FLATTERY THAT THEY WILL SWALLOW ANY AMOUNT OF IT AND THRIVE THEREON PADDY HAD A FINER TASTE THE STORY GIRL AND I WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD PAY HIM COMPLIMENTS TO HIS LIKING
FRIDAY WAS A COMFORTABLE DAY IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF KING EVERYBODY WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR THE STORY GIRL SPARKLED THROUGH SEVERAL TALES THAT RANGED FROM THE AFRITES AND JINNS OF EASTERN MYTH THROUGH THE PIPING DAYS OF CHIVALRY DOWN TO THE HOMELY ANECDOTES OF CARLISLE WORKADAY FOLKS
I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT TO BE FULL OF ROCKS AND PROMONTORIES GREY MOSS AND BRUSH WOOD BUT THESE ARE ALL LOST ON ME I KNOW NOTHING OF THE PICTURESQUE
BUT IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE HAD EATEN THE COOKIES AND FELICITY SUGGESTED THAT A SAUCERFUL APIECE
AND MISSUS ALLEN'S WAVERING CONVICTIONS ONLY MADE IT MORE DOUBTFUL TO MILSOM STREET SHE WAS DIRECTED AND HAVING MADE HERSELF PERFECT IN THE NUMBER HASTENED AWAY WITH EAGER STEPS AND A BEATING HEART TO PAY HER VISIT EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT AND BE FORGIVEN
AS YOU ARE NOT YET READY FOR BREAKFAST
I'D LIKE TO SIGHED FELICITY BUT WE'D COME HOME TIRED AND WITH ALL THE MILKING TO DO YOU BOYS BETTER GO ALONE PETER AND I WILL ATTEND TO THE MILKING FOR ONE EVENING SAID UNCLE ROGER YOU CAN ALL GO
THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME AND IT ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
AND FORCED HIM TO HEAR HER EXPLANATION FEELINGS RATHER NATURAL THAN HEROIC POSSESSED HER INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING HER OWN DIGNITY INJURED BY THIS READY CONDEMNATION INSTEAD OF PROUDLY RESOLVING IN CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE
EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE AND WHEN THEIR VISITORS LEFT THEM HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HAVE BEEN GUESSING SHALL I TELL YOU MY GUESS
WHILE CECILY ADMITTED THAT WILLY FRASER HAD WRITTEN ON HIS SLATE AND SHOWED IT TO HER IF YOU LOVE ME AS I LOVE YOU NO KNIFE CAN CUT OUR LOVE IN TWO BUT SARA RAY NEVER YOU BREATHE THIS TO A LIVING SOUL
THERE'S NO USE ASKING THE MEANING OF THIS I SUPPOSE SAID UNCLE ROGER WITH THE CALM OF DESPAIR I'VE GAVE UP TRYING TO FATHOM YOU YOUNG ONES PETER WHERE'S THE KEY WHAT YARN HAVE YOU BEEN TELLING
AND AS SHE RETIRED DOWN THE STREET COULD NOT WITHHOLD ONE GLANCE AT THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS IN EXPECTATION OF SEEING HER THERE
SOMEBODY KILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENED IN OUR FAMILY THE KINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RESPECTABLE PERHAPS IT IS EMILY
WE RAN TO THE ORCHARD GATE AND SWARMED ACROSS THE YARD JUST AS UNCLE ROGER ALIGHTED AT THE FRONT DOOR HE STARED AT US IN THE MOONLIGHT
KNOW HIM THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE MUCH ABOUT TOWN THAT I DO NOT KNOW I HAVE MET HIM FOREVER AT THE BEDFORD AND I KNEW HIS FACE AGAIN TODAY THE MOMENT HE CAME INTO THE BILLIARD ROOM ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS WE HAVE BY THE BY AND WE HAD A LITTLE TOUCH TOGETHER THOUGH I WAS ALMOST AFRAID OF HIM AT FIRST
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STREET HOWEVER SHE LOOKED BACK AGAIN AND THEN NOT AT A WINDOW BUT ISSUING FROM THE DOOR SHE SAW MISS TILNEY HERSELF SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENTLEMAN WHOM CATHERINE BELIEVED TO BE HER FATHER AND THEY TURNED UP TOWARDS EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
SHE WAS IN TURN AN ORIENTAL PRINCESS BEHIND A SILKEN VEIL THE BRIDE WHO FOLLOWED HER BRIDEGROOM TO THE WARS OF PALESTINE DISGUISED AS A PAGE THE GALLANT LADY WHO RANSOMED HER DIAMOND NECKLACE BY DANCING A CORANTO
MISSUS JENNINGS ENFORCED THE NECESSITY AND WHO KNOWS BUT YOU MAY RAISE A DANCE SAID SHE AND THAT WILL TEMPT YOU MISS MARIANNE A DANCE CRIED MARIANNE IMPOSSIBLE WHO IS TO DANCE WHO WHY YOURSELVES AND THE CAREYS AND WHITAKERS TO BE SURE
WHEN EDWARD INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING YOU MUST NOT ENQUIRE TOO FAR MARIANNE REMEMBER I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE IN THE PICTURESQUE AND I SHALL OFFEND YOU BY MY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF TASTE IF WE COME TO PARTICULARS
I THINK THERE IS SUCH A PLACE IN SPITE OF UNCLE EDWARD SAID THE STORY GIRL DREAMILY AND I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF GETTING THERE TOO IF WE COULD ONLY FIND IT
YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ME SO RUDE BUT INDEED IT WAS NOT MY OWN FAULT WAS IT MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT THEY TELL ME THAT MISTER TILNEY AND HIS SISTER WERE GONE OUT IN A PHAETON TOGETHER AND THEN WHAT COULD I DO BUT I HAD TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER HAVE BEEN WITH YOU
IT'S ALL PETER'S FAULT SAID FELICITY I DO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE SENSE THAN TO TAKE A CLOCK STRIKING FOR A BELL RINGING
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT A RASPBERRY PIE FOR TO MORROW NIGHT WHEN THE FOLKS COME HOME WOULD HIT THE RIGHT SPOT ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA WE ALL SET OFF ARMED WITH JUGS AND CUPS FELICITY THOUGHTFUL CREATURE ALSO TOOK A SMALL BASKETFUL OF JELLY COOKIES ALONG WITH HER
AND WHO IS WILLOUGHBY SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE TO MISS DASHWOOD BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING SHE GAVE HIM A BRIEF REPLY
AND THAT IS THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE ON THAT DAY THE GATES OF EDEN ARE SHUT BEHIND THEM AND THE AGE OF GOLD IS OVER HENCEFORTH THEY MUST DWELL IN THE COMMON LIGHT OF COMMON DAY ONLY A FEW WHO REMAIN CHILDREN AT HEART CAN EVER FIND THAT FAIR LOST PATH AGAIN
WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
THE HILLS ARE STEEP THE WOODS SEEM FULL OF FINE TIMBER
TO SHOW HER RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM WHO COULD HARBOUR A DOUBT OF IT TO LEAVE TO HIM ALL THE TROUBLE OF SEEKING AN EXPLANATION AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIM ON THE PAST ONLY BY AVOIDING HIS SIGHT OR FLIRTING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE SHAME OF MISCONDUCT
WHICH COULD NOT BE WORN WHILE DRIVING EXCEPT BY A PERSONAGE AT HIS SIDE SAT THE LADY OF REMSEN'S HEART THE LADY WHO LOOKED LIKE POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS AND THE GIBBOUS MOON REMSEN MET THEM COMING
THERE HE RUMBLED A ROUGHLY GOOD HUMOURED PROTEST THAT'S THE GIRL FOR MY MONEY HE DECLARED SHE CAN EAT OUT OF MY SKILLET THE REST OF HER LIFE WHY I NEVER SEE SUCH A FINE GIRL I'M GOING BACK THERE AND ASK HER TO MARRY ME
THE COTTON HAS ITS BOLLWORM THE CHORUS GIRL HAS HER PITTSBURGER THE SUMMER BOARDER HAS HIS POISON IVY THE HERO HAS HIS CARNEGIE MEDAL ART HAS ITS MORGAN THE ROSE HAS ITS
THREE YEARS AGO KRAFT BILL JUDKINS A POET AND I TOOK OUR MEALS AT CYPHER'S ON EIGHTH AVENUE I SAY TOOK WHEN WE HAD MONEY CYPHER GOT IT OFF OF US AS HE EXPRESSED IT
ALL ABOUT LAY HER THINGS IN CONFUSION SHOES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR CURLING TONGS HAIR BOWS KIMONOS POWDER BOX JUMBLED TOGETHER ON DRESSER AND CHAIRS THIS WAS NOT KATY'S WAY
HICKEY AND MOONEY OF THE VAUDEVILLE TEAM UNBOOKED IN THE FLAT ACROSS THE HALL WOULD YIELD TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF DELIRIUM TREMENS AND BEGIN TO OVERTURN CHAIRS UNDER THE DELUSION THAT HAMMERSTEIN WAS PURSUING THEM
THAT WOULD HAVE DRAWN SAINT PYRITES FROM HIS IRON PILLAR OR WHATEVER THE ALLUSION IS AND OF THE LADY'S SMILE AND LOOK A LITTLE FRIGHTENED BUT A LOOK THAT WITH THE EVER COWARD HEART OF A TRUE LOVER HE COULD NOT YET CONSTRUE
HIS HOME WAS DISMANTLED
ONE DAY A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN DISTURBED HIM AT HIS CLUB AND HE AND O'ROON WERE SOON POUNDING EACH OTHER AND EXCHANGING OPPROBRIOUS EPITHETS AFTER THE MANNER OF LONG LOST FRIENDS
THEN SAID I WHEN YOU LED US AGAINST THE LUMBERMAN THE KLONDIKER IT WASN'T ALTOGETHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE WELL
LUCKILY FOR REMSEN'S PEACE OF MIND THERE CAME A DIVERSION IN THE GUISE OF A REUNION OF THE GENTLE RIDERS OF THE CITY THERE WERE NOT MANY OF THEM PERHAPS A SCORE AND THERE WAS WASSAIL AND THINGS TO EAT
THE TWO RODE SIDE BY SIDE DURING THE FAMOUS MOOTED UP HILL CHARGE THAT WAS DISPUTED SO HOTLY AT THE TIME BY THE SPANIARDS AND AFTERWARD BY THE DEMOCRATS AFTER THE WAR REMSEN CAME BACK TO HIS POLO AND SHAD
AND THE BOTTLE OF STRAWBERRY MARMALADE BLUSHING AT THE CERTIFICATE OF CHEMICAL PURITY ON ITS LABEL AFTER DINNER KATY WOULD SHOW HIM THE NEW PATCH IN HER CRAZY QUILT THAT THE ICEMAN HAD CUT FOR HER OFF THE END OF HIS FOUR IN HAND
ONCE WHEN WE LEFT HIM UNPAID
YES THERE WAS THE CITY ROARING OUTSIDE FOR JOHN PERKINS TO COME DANCE IN THE TRAIN OF MOMUS AND AT MC CLOSKEY'S THE BOYS WERE KNOCKING THE BALLS IDLY INTO THE POCKETS AGAINST THE HOUR FOR THE NIGHTLY GAME BUT NO PRIMROSE WAY
BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF THE VERY HAND OF DEATH HAD POINTED A FINGER AT HIS SECURE AND UNEVENTFUL HOME JOHN DRAGGED THE COLD MUTTON FROM THE ICE BOX
JOHN SAT AT A FRONT WINDOW HE DID NOT CARE TO SMOKE OUTSIDE THE CITY ROARED TO HIM TO COME JOIN IN ITS DANCE OF FOLLY AND PLEASURE THE NIGHT WAS HIS
REMSEN LINGERING WAS DIMLY CONSCIOUS OF A VAGUE IMPOSSIBLE UNNECESSARY OLD GENTLEMAN IN A SCOTCH CAP WHO TALKED INCESSANTLY ABOUT SOMETHING AND HE WAS ACUTELY CONSCIOUS OF A PAIR OF VIOLET EYES
DON'T MENTION IT HE SAID STOLIDLY WE POLICEMEN ARE PAID TO DO THESE THINGS IT'S OUR DUTY AND HE RODE AWAY
I'D LIKE TO BE ONE OF THOSE BOBBIES ON HORSEBACK THAT WOULD BE ABOUT THE TICKET BESIDES IT'S THE ONLY THING I COULD DO I CAN RIDE A LITTLE AND THE FRESH AIR SUITS ME THINK YOU COULD LAND THAT FOR ME
SHE WAS A GRAND EXAMPLE OF KRAFT'S THEORY OF THE ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE SHE BELONGED LARGELY TO WAITING AS MINERVA DID TO THE ART OF SCRAPPING OR VENUS TO THE SCIENCE OF SERIOUS FLIRTATION
MILLY STEERED HER MAGNIFICENT WAY LIKE SOME GREAT LINER CLEAVING AMONG THE CANOES OF HOWLING SAVAGES OUR GODDESS OF GRUB WAS BUILT ON LINES SO MAJESTIC THAT THEY COULD BE FOLLOWED ONLY WITH AWE
IT CAME JUST AS REMSEN WAS STROLLING INTO FIFTH AVENUE FROM HIS CLUB A FEW DOORS AWAY A MOTOR CAR WAS CREEPING ALONG FOOT BY FOOT IMPEDED BY A FRESHET OF VEHICLES THAT FILLED THE STREET
ONE OF THE TROOPERS WAS A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF O'ROON TO THIS YOUNG MAN REMSEN TOOK AN ESPECIAL LIKING
MA WASN'T SICK TO AMOUNT TO ANYTHING
THE PENDULUM EIGHTY FIRST STREET LET EM OUT PLEASE YELLED THE SHEPHERD IN BLUE A FLOCK OF CITIZEN SHEEP SCRAMBLED OUT AND ANOTHER FLOCK SCRAMBLED ABOARD
THERE AMID THE STEAM OF VEGETABLES AND THE VAPOURS OF ACRES OF HAM AND THE CRASH OF CROCKERY THE CLATTER OF STEEL THE SCREAMING OF SHORT ORDERS THE CRIES OF THE HUNGERING AND ALL THE HORRID TUMULT OF FEEDING MAN
YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE DIAMOND TIARAS ON MILLY'S BROW AND THE HAND EMBROIDERED SILK PARIS GOWNS THAT HE MEANT TO BUY FOR HER AT LAST THE BOLLWORM HAD ATTACKED THE COTTON THE POISON IVY WAS REACHING OUT ITS TENDRILS TO ENTWINE THE SUMMER BOARDER
KRAFT WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR SUCH A POLITE BARBED INSULT RELATING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE MISERLY WITH THEIR FUNDS THAT THE MINER CRASHED DOWN HANDFUL AFTER HANDFUL OF SILVER AND NOTES CALLING FOR ALL THE FLUIDS IN THE WORLD TO DROWN THE IMPUTATION
AND NOW AT THE EXTREME RISK OF WEARYING OLD GENTLEMEN WHO CARRY LEATHER FOB CHAINS AND ELDERLY LADIES WHO BUT NO GRANDMOTHER HERSELF YET THRILLS AT FOOLISH IMMORTAL ROMEO THERE MUST BE A HINT OF LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
WE HAD NO CREDIT WE WENT IN CALLED FOR FOOD AND ATE IT WE PAID OR WE DID NOT PAY WE HAD CONFIDENCE IN CYPHER'S SULLENNESS AND SMOULDERING FEROCITY
THE PAINTER WAS A YOUNG SCRUB OUT OF THE WEST NAMED KRAFT WHO HAD A FAVOURITE FOOD AND A PET THEORY HIS PABULUM WAS AN UNQUENCHABLE BELIEF IN THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE
DON'T FORGET TO WRITE TO THE COMPANY ABOUT THE GAS METER AND YOUR GOOD SOCKS ARE IN THE TOP DRAWER I WILL WRITE TO MORROW HASTILY KATY NEVER DURING THEIR TWO YEARS OF MATRIMONY
OUR PATHS SEPARATED AND I SAW KRAFT NO MORE AND JUDKINS SELDOM BUT AS I SAID I SAW A PAINTING THE OTHER DAY THAT WAS SOLD FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE TITLE WAS BOADICEA
WITH A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR A WEEK CONTRACT THEN THE GENT AT THE WINDOW ACROSS THE AIR SHAFT WOULD GET OUT HIS FLUTE THE NIGHTLY GAS LEAK WOULD STEAL FORTH TO FROLIC IN THE HIGHWAYS THE DUMBWAITER WOULD SLIP OFF ITS TROLLEY
STUFFED PTARMIGANS BEAD WORK AND SEAL PELTS OF THE RETURNED KLONDIKER AND BEGAN TO PRATE TO US OF HIS MILLIONS BANK DRAFTS FOR TWO MILLIONS WAS HIS SUMMING UP
OF AN ESSENCE GONE OF ITS SOUL AND LIFE DEPARTED JOHN PERKINS STOOD AMONG THE DEAD REMAINS WITH A QUEER FEELING OF DESOLATION IN HIS HEART HE BEGAN TO SET THE ROOMS TIDY AS WELL AS HE COULD
BUT HE KNEW THAT WOULD BE THE LAST MEANS OF ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO RIDE IN MOTOR CARS SLOWLY THE AUTO PASSED AND IF WE PLACE THE POETS ABOVE THE AUTOISTS CARRIED THE HEART OF REMSEN WITH IT
BUT THESE TWO WERE OF NO CONSEQUENCE EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR THE GUIDING OF THE MACHINE AND THE PAYING FOR IT AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE SAT A YOUNG LADY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS
IN THE CAR WAS A CHAUFFEUR AND AN OLD GENTLEMAN WITH SNOWY SIDE WHISKERS AND A SCOTCH PLAID CAP WHICH COULD NOT BE WORN WHILE AUTOMOBILING EXCEPT BY A PERSONAGE NOT EVEN A WINE AGENT WOULD DARE DO IT
I NEVER GOT OFF THE TRAIN SINCE I MUSHED OUT OF SEATTLE AND I'M HUNGRY THE STUFF THE NIGGERS FEED YOU ON PULLMANS DON'T COUNT YOU GENTLEMEN ORDER WHAT YOU WANT AND THEN MILLY LOOMED UP WITH A THOUSAND DISHES ON HER BARE ARM
AND HE WILL MARRY MILLY NEVER EXCLAIMED JUDKINS AND I IN HORROR A LUMBERMAN REPEATED KRAFT HOARSELY AND A MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN I SIGHED DESPAIRINGLY FROM WISCONSIN GROANED JUDKINS
NOW WHERE ARE YOU GOING I'D LIKE TO KNOW JOHN PERKINS
HE HIT UNERRINGLY UPON THE KEYNOTE OF HIS DISCOMFORT HE KNEW NOW THAT KATY WAS NECESSARY TO HIS HAPPINESS HIS FEELING FOR HER LULLED INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY THE DULL ROUND OF DOMESTICITY
HER SLEEVES WERE ALWAYS ROLLED ABOVE HER ELBOWS SHE COULD HAVE TAKEN US THREE MUSKETEERS IN HER TWO HANDS AND DROPPED US OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE HAD SEEN FEWER YEARS THAN ANY OF US BUT SHE WAS OF SUCH SUPERB EVEHOOD AND SIMPLICITY THAT SHE MOTHERED US FROM THE BEGINNING
NECESSARY BUT SCARCELY NOTICED NOW WITHOUT WARNING SHE WAS GONE VANISHED AS COMPLETELY ABSENT AS IF SHE HAD NEVER EXISTED OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS OR AT MOST A WEEK OR TWO
ASKED JUDKINS FEARSOMELY SHE WILL GO TO NIGHT SCHOOL AND BECOME REFINED I VENTURED ANXIOUSLY IT IS THIS SAID KRAFT PUNCTUATING IN A PUDDLE OF SPILLED COFFEE WITH A STIFF FOREFINGER CAESAR HAD HIS BRUTUS
WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE CAMPS HE ASSAULTED OUR EARS AND CLAIMED THE FELLOWSHIP OF MEN LOST IN THE WILDS OF A HASH HOUSE WE EMBRACED HIM AS A SPECIMEN AND IN THREE MINUTES WE HAD ALL BUT DIED FOR ONE ANOTHER AS FRIENDS
SLOWLY BECAUSE IN THE LEXICON OF HIS DAILY LIFE THERE WAS NO SUCH WORD AS PERHAPS THERE ARE NO SURPRISES AWAITING A MAN WHO HAS BEEN MARRIED TWO YEARS AND LIVES IN A FLAT AS HE WALKED
ATONED FOR HIS MODEST RATING AT ONLY TEN MILLIONS ATE HIS CANNED BEEF GAYLY BY THE CAMPFIRES OF THE GENTLE RIDERS THE WAR WAS A GREAT LARK TO HIM SO THAT HE SCARCELY REGRETTED POLO AND PLANKED SHAD
MADE COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO A LONELY MEAL FACE TO FACE WITH THE STRAWBERRY MARMALADE'S SHAMELESS CERTIFICATE OF PURITY BRIGHT AMONG WITHDRAWN BLESSINGS NOW APPEARED TO HIM THE GHOSTS OF POT ROASTS AND THE SALAD WITH TAN POLISH DRESSING
WITH YOUR BADGE ON YOUR HORSE IN YOUR UNIFORM WILL I CHARM NURSE MAIDS AND PREVENT THE GRASS FROM GROWING UNDER PEOPLE'S FEET IN THE PARK THIS DAY I WILL HAVE YOUR BADGE AND YOUR HONOR BESIDES HAVING THE JOLLIEST LARK I'VE BEEN BLESSED WITH SINCE WE LICKED SPAIN
THIS I SAY HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO AND ABOUT THAT TIME A LITTLE LUCK DESCENDED UPON US THREE AND WE WERE ENABLED TO BUY COSTLIER AND LESS WHOLESOME FOOD THAN CYPHER'S
LOOMED UP BIG AND WHITE AND PINK AND AWFUL AS MOUNT SAINT ELIAS WITH A SMILE LIKE DAY BREAKING IN A GULCH AND THE KLONDIKER THREW DOWN HIS PELTS AND NUGGETS AS DROSS AND LET HIS JAW FALL HALF WAY AND STARED AT HER
HER VOICE RANG LIKE A GREAT SILVER BELL HER SMILE WAS MANY TOOTHED AND FREQUENT SHE SEEMED LIKE A YELLOW SUNRISE ON MOUNTAIN TOPS I NEVER SAW HER BUT I THOUGHT OF THE YOSEMITE
A LITTLE PAPER BAG OF HER FAVORITE BUTTER SCOTCH LAY WITH ITS STRING YET UNWOUND A DAILY PAPER SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR GAPING RECTANGULARLY WHERE A RAILROAD TIME TABLE HAD BEEN CLIPPED FROM IT EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM SPOKE OF A LOSS
HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR ALL HIS NEGLECT WHAT WAS LIFE WITHOUT HER THE DOOR OPENED KATY WALKED IN CARRYING A LITTLE HAND SATCHEL JOHN STARED AT HER STUPIDLY MY I'M GLAD TO GET BACK SAID KATY
THE MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN THINLY DISGUISED AS THE ALASKAN MINER WAS ABOUT TO ENGULF OUR MILLY AND UPSET NATURE'S ADJUSTMENT KRAFT WAS THE FIRST TO ACT HE LEAPED UP AND POUNDED THE KLONDIKER'S BACK COME OUT AND DRINK HE SHOUTED
I GUESS SHE WON'T WANT TO SLING HASH ANY MORE WHEN SHE SEES THE PILE OF DUST I'VE GOT YOU'LL TAKE ANOTHER WHISKEY AND MILK NOW KRAFT PERSUADED WITH SATAN'S SMILE I THOUGHT YOU UP COUNTRY FELLOWS WERE BETTER SPORTS
TWO WHO SOMEWHAT RESEMBLE EACH OTHER IN FEATURE AND FIGURE WILL APPEAR AS TWIN BROTHERS SO REMSEN TROTTED DOWN THE BRIDLE PATHS ENJOYING HIMSELF HUGELY SO FEW REAL PLEASURES DO TEN MILLIONAIRES HAVE
THE BAYS HAD BOLTED REMSEN SENT HIS CHESTNUT AFTER THE VICTORIA LIKE A SHOT THERE WAS WORK CUT OUT FOR THE IMPERSONATOR OF POLICEMAN O'ROON THE CHESTNUT RANGED ALONGSIDE THE OFF BAY THIRTY SECONDS AFTER THE CHASE BEGAN
TO THE EXQUISITE CONGRUITY BETWEEN MILLY AND CYPHER'S THERE IS A CERTAIN FATE HANGING OVER MILLY SAID KRAFT AND IF IT OVERTAKES HER SHE IS LOST TO CYPHER'S AND TO US SHE WILL GROW FAT
READY TO MELT IN THE CRUCIBLE OF HER IRE A LITTLE MORE GOLD PLATING FROM THE WROUGHT STEEL CHAINS OF MATRIMONY FOR THESE THINGS CUPID WILL HAVE TO ANSWER WHEN HE STANDS AT THE BAR OF JUSTICE WITH HIS VICTIMS FROM THE FROGMORE FLATS
HAD BEEN SHARPLY STIRRED BY THE LOSS OF HER PRESENCE HAS IT NOT BEEN DINNED INTO US BY PROVERB AND SERMON AND FABLE THAT WE NEVER PRIZE THE MUSIC TILL THE SWEET VOICED BIRD HAS FLOWN
AT THE INSTANT OF THEIR PASSING HER EYES LOOKED INTO HIS AND BUT FOR THE EVER COWARD'S HEART OF A TRUE LOVER HE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT SHE FLUSHED A FAINT PINK
PROMPTLY ON TIME THE COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENT OF MOUNTED POLICEMAN O'ROON SINGLE FOOTED INTO THE PARK ON HIS CHESTNUT STEED IN A UNIFORM TWO MEN WHO ARE UNLIKE WILL LOOK ALIKE
IF YOU DAMAGED THAT HORSE OF MINE I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU I'M GOING TO BUY HIM AND TAKE HIM BACK WITH ME OH YES AND I THINK MY SISTER LADY ANGELA YOU KNOW WANTS PARTICULARLY FOR YOU TO COME UP TO THE HOTEL WITH ME THIS EVENING
NO TROUBLE AT ALL SAID REMSEN I KNOW A LOT OF MEN WHO HAVE BANKS AND STORES AND THINGS DOWNTOWN ANY PARTICULAR LINE YOU FANCY YES SAID O'ROON WITH A LOOK OF INTEREST I TOOK A WALK IN YOUR CENTRAL PARK THIS MORNING
WE WERE AT OUR SUPPER OF BEEF STEW AND DRIED APPLES WHEN HE TROTTED IN AS IF ON THE HEELS OF A DOG TEAM AND MADE ONE OF THE MESS AT OUR TABLE
SPEAK I INTERRUPTED MUCH PERTURBED YOU DO NOT THINK THAT MILLY WILL BEGIN TO LACE ONE DAY CONCLUDED KRAFT SOLEMNLY THERE WILL COME TO CYPHER'S FOR A PLATE OF BEANS A MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN FROM WISCONSIN
AND SCOTCH CAP FROM POSSIBLE DEATH WHERE WAS POLICEMAN O'ROON OFF HIS BEAT EXPOSED DISGRACED DISCHARGED
HE MIGHT GO FORTH UNQUESTIONED AND THRUM THE STRINGS OF JOLLITY AS FREE AS ANY GAY BACHELOR THERE HE MIGHT CAROUSE AND WANDER AND HAVE HIS FLING UNTIL DAWN IF HE LIKED AND THERE WOULD BE NO WRATHFUL KATY WAITING FOR HIM
O'ROON LOOKED SEEDY AND OUT OF LUCK AND PERFECTLY CONTENTED BUT IT SEEMED THAT HIS CONTENT WAS ONLY APPARENT GET ME A JOB REMSEN HE SAID I'VE JUST HANDED A BARBER MY LAST SHILLING
WINSOME WAITRESS WINS WEALTHY WISCONSIN WOODSMAN FOR A WHILE WE FELT THAT MILLY WAS ON THE VERGE OF BEING LOST TO US IT WAS OUR LOVE OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE THAT INSPIRED US
THERE ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR HUNG PATHETICALLY EMPTY AND FORMLESS THE RED WRAPPER WITH BLACK DOTS THAT SHE ALWAYS WORE WHILE GETTING THE MEALS HER WEEK DAY CLOTHES HAD BEEN TOSSED HERE AND THERE IN HER HASTE
OF RUSSIANS AND JAPS SLAUGHTERED BY THE DEADLY LINOTYPE FOR DINNER THERE WOULD BE POT ROAST A SALAD FLAVORED WITH A DRESSING WARRANTED NOT TO CRACK OR INJURE THE LEATHER STEWED RHUBARB
I LOOKED BACK AND SAW HIM SHAKING WITH INAUDIBLE LAUGHTER BEHIND HIS FILM NOW AND THEN WE PAID UP BACK SCORES BUT THE CHIEF THING AT CYPHER'S WAS MILLY MILLY WAS A WAITRESS
AND MANY WOMEN WHO AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE APPEAR TO RESEMBLE POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS YET HE HOPED TO SEE HER AGAIN FOR EACH ONE FANCIES THAT HIS ROMANCE HAS ITS OWN TUTELARY GUARDIAN AND DIVINITY
OUR FEARS MUST HAVE BEEN PROPHETIC FOR ON THAT SAME EVENING THE WILDWOOD DISCHARGED UPON US MILLY'S PREORDAINED CONFISCATOR OUR FEE TO ADJUSTMENT AND ORDER BUT ALASKA AND NOT WISCONSIN BORE THE BURDEN OF THE VISITATION
ONCE FORTUNE SMILED UPON THEM STRAIGHT TO NEW YORK THEY HIE AND LAY THEIR GOODS AT THE FEET OF THE GIRL WHO SERVES THEM BEANS IN A BEANERY WHY THE ALPHABET ITSELF CONNIVES THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPER'S HEADLINER'S WORK IS CUT FOR HIM
BUT KNOWING HE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE ANYTHING ELSE AT THE END OF THE DAY REMSEN SENT THE CHESTNUT TO HIS STABLE AND WENT TO O'ROON'S ROOM THE POLICEMAN WAS AGAIN A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN
AND SPEECHES AND THE SPANIARD WAS BEARDED AGAIN IN RECAPITULATION AND WHEN DAYLIGHT THREATENED THEM THE SURVIVORS PREPARED TO DEPART BUT SOME REMAINED UPON THE BATTLEFIELD ONE OF THESE WAS TROOPER O'ROON WHO WAS NOT SEASONED TO POTENT LIQUIDS
WHO SAT BY THE WINDOW SMOKING CIGARS I WISH YOU AND THE REST OF THE POLICE FORCE AND ALL BADGES HORSES BRASS BUTTONS AND MEN WHO CAN'T DRINK TWO GLASSES OF BRUT WITHOUT GETTING UPSET WERE AT THE DEVIL SAID REMSEN FEELINGLY
OF LATE SUCH HAD BEEN JOHN PERKINS'S HABIT AT TEN OR ELEVEN HE WOULD RETURN SOMETIMES KATY WOULD BE ASLEEP SOMETIMES WAITING UP
SUCH AS DRINK POLICEMEN HORSES AND EARLDOMS DURING A CERTAIN WAR A TROOP CALLING ITSELF THE GENTLE RIDERS RODE INTO HISTORY AND ONE OR TWO AMBUSCADES THE GENTLE RIDERS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE WILD MEN OF THE WEST
I'M A DOUBLE DYED DUB MUSED JOHN PERKINS THE WAY I'VE BEEN TREATING KATY OFF EVERY NIGHT PLAYING POOL AND BUMMING WITH THE BOYS INSTEAD OF STAYING HOME WITH HER THE POOR GIRL HERE ALL ALONE WITH NOTHING TO AMUSE HER AND ME ACTING THAT WAY
FOR SHE ALWAYS CAREFULLY PLACED THESE COMBINGS IN THE LITTLE BLUE VASE ON THE MANTEL TO BE SOME DAY FORMED INTO THE COVETED FEMININE RAT HANGING CONSPICUOUSLY TO THE GAS JET BY A STRING WAS A FOLDED PAPER
THEY WERE ASKING HIS NAME AND BESTOWING UPON HIM WELLBRED THANKS FOR HIS HEROIC DEED AND THE SCOTCH CAP WAS ESPECIALLY BABBLING AND INSISTENT BUT THE ELOQUENT APPEAL WAS IN THE EYES OF THE LADY A LITTLE THRILL OF SATISFACTION RAN THROUGH REMSEN
AND THE FIGURE SEEMED TO FILL ALL OUT OF DOORS BUT OF ALL THE PICTURE'S ADMIRERS WHO STOOD BEFORE IT I BELIEVE I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO LONGED FOR BOADICEA TO STALK FROM HER FRAME BRINGING ME CORNED BEEF HASH WITH POACHED EGG
WITH A SINKING HEART JOHN SAW THE COMB WITH A CURLING CLOUD OF HER BROWN HAIR AMONG ITS TEETH SOME UNUSUAL HURRY AND PERTURBATION MUST HAVE POSSESSED HER
AT HALF PAST SEVEN THEY WOULD SPREAD NEWSPAPERS OVER THE FURNITURE TO CATCH THE PIECES OF PLASTERING THAT FELL WHEN THE FAT MAN IN THE FLAT OVERHEAD BEGAN TO TAKE HIS PHYSICAL CULTURE EXERCISES EXACTLY AT EIGHT
HIS LEGS DECLINED TO FULFIL THE OBLIGATIONS THEY HAD SWORN TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT I'M STEWED REMSEN SAID O'ROON TO HIS FRIEND WHY DO THEY BUILD HOTELS THAT GO ROUND AND ROUND LIKE CATHERINE WHEELS
HE WAS RUGGED AND BEARDED AND WIND DRIED HE HAD JUST COME OFF THE TRAIL HE SAID AT ONE OF THE NORTH RIVER FERRIES I FANCIED I COULD SEE THE SNOW DUST OF CHILCOOT YET POWDERING HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN HE STREWED THE TABLE WITH THE NUGGETS
IT STILL RETAINED SOMETHING OF HER CONTOUR MIDWAY OF THE SLEEVES WERE FINE INDIVIDUAL WRINKLES MADE BY THE MOVEMENTS OF HER ARMS IN WORKING FOR HIS COMFORT AND PLEASURE A DELICATE BUT IMPELLING ODOR OF BLUEBELLS CAME FROM IT
JOHN PERKINS YOU'RE THE WORST KIND OF A SHINE I'M GOING TO MAKE IT UP FOR THE LITTLE GIRL I'LL TAKE HER OUT AND LET HER SEE SOME AMUSEMENT AND I'LL CUT OUT THE MC CLOSKEY GANG RIGHT FROM THIS MINUTE
ALONG THE DRIVEWAY IN THE EARLY MORNING SPUN A VICTORIA DRAWN BY A PAIR OF FIERY BAYS THERE WAS SOMETHING FOREIGN ABOUT THE AFFAIR
AND THE WILD MEN OF THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE EAST IN KHAKI THERE IS LITTLE TELLING THEM ONE FROM ANOTHER SO THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS AND COMRADES ALL AROUND ELLSWORTH REMSEN WHOSE OLD KNICKERBOCKER DESCENT
DEEP DOWN IN HIS SUNLESS SOUL HE WAS EITHER A PRINCE A FOOL OR AN ARTIST HE SAT AT A WORM EATEN DESK COVERED WITH FILES OF WAITERS CHECKS SO OLD THAT I WAS SURE THE BOTTOMEST ONE WAS FOR CLAMS THAT HENDRIK HUDSON HAD EATEN AND PAID FOR
WHEN HE TOUCHED HER CLOTHES A THRILL OF SOMETHING LIKE TERROR WENT THROUGH HIM HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT WHAT EXISTENCE WOULD BE WITHOUT KATY SHE HAD BECOME SO THOROUGHLY ANNEALED INTO HIS LIFE THAT SHE WAS LIKE THE AIR HE BREATHED
BECAUSE HE HAD A NAME TO GIVE WHICH WITHOUT UNDUE PRIDE WAS WORTHY OF BEING SPOKEN IN HIGH PLACES AND A SMALL FORTUNE WHICH WITH DUE PRIDE HE COULD LEAVE AT HIS END WITHOUT DISGRACE HE OPENED HIS LIPS TO SPEAK
YOU EXPECTED TO SEE HER COLOSSAL FIGURE LOOM THROUGH THAT REEKING BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE FROM FRYING FAT JUST AS YOU EXPECT THE PALISADES TO APPEAR THROUGH A DRIFTING HUDSON RIVER FOG
NOR CLICKING CUE COULD WOO THE REMORSEFUL SOUL OF PERKINS THE BEREFT THE THING THAT WAS HIS LIGHTLY HELD AND HALF SCORNED HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM AND HE WANTED IT BACKWARD TO A CERTAIN MAN NAMED ADAM
AND YET SOMEHOW I COULD NEVER THINK OF HER AS EXISTING OUTSIDE OF CYPHER'S THERE NATURE HAD PLACED HER AND SHE HAD TAKEN ROOT AND GROWN MIGHTILY
THE JANITOR WOULD DRIVE MISSUS ZANOWITSKI'S FIVE CHILDREN ONCE MORE ACROSS THE YALU THE LADY WITH THE CHAMPAGNE SHOES AND THE SKYE TERRIER WOULD TRIP DOWNSTAIRS AND PASTE HER THURSDAY NAME OVER HER BELL AND LETTER BOX
THUS THE WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH HIS OWN GUNS WE DROVE HIM FROM THE FIELD AND THEN WE HAD HIM CARTED TO A DISTANT SMALL HOTEL AND PUT TO BED WITH HIS NUGGETS AND BABY SEAL SKINS STUFFED AROUND HIM HE WILL NEVER FIND CYPHER'S AGAIN SAID KRAFT
THE DRIVER RELEASED HIS HANDS FROM THE WRAPPED REINS JUMPED FROM HIS SEAT AND STOOD AT THE HEADS OF THE TEAM THE CHESTNUT APPROVING HIS NEW RIDER DANCED AND PRANCED REVILING EQUINELY THE SUBDUED BAYS
TO NIGHT JOHN PERKINS ENCOUNTERED A TREMENDOUS UPHEAVAL OF THE COMMONPLACE WHEN HE REACHED HIS DOOR NO KATY WAS THERE WITH HER AFFECTIONATE CONFECTIONATE KISS THE THREE ROOMS SEEMED IN PORTENTOUS DISORDER
BEARING THE CHALICE THAT HELD THE DREGS OF HIS JOY HE MIGHT PLAY POOL AT MC CLOSKEY'S WITH HIS ROISTERING FRIENDS UNTIL AURORA DIMMED THE ELECTRIC BULBS IF HE CHOSE
DING DING THE CATTLE CARS OF THE MANHATTAN ELEVATED RATTLED AWAY AND JOHN PERKINS DRIFTED DOWN THE STAIRWAY OF THE STATION WITH THE RELEASED FLOCK JOHN WALKED SLOWLY TOWARD HIS FLAT
MORE EXQUISITE THAN THE FIRST QUARTER MOON VIEWED AT TWILIGHT THROUGH THE TOPS OF OLEANDERS REMSEN SAW HER AND KNEW HIS FATE HE COULD HAVE FLUNG HIMSELF UNDER THE VERY WHEELS THAT CONVEYED HER
JOHN SEIZED IT IT WAS A NOTE FROM HIS WIFE RUNNING THUS DEAR JOHN I JUST HAD A TELEGRAM SAYING MOTHER IS VERY SICK
AH YOU'RE ALL RIGHT O'ROON COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT MORE NEATLY
THE BADGE OF POLICEMAN O'ROON IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE LOOKED UPON ONE ANOTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME AND BECOME INSTANTLY ENAMORED IT IS A RISKY PROCESS THIS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
OF HIS OWN FORGING HE CAN EXPLAIN IN TEN THICK VOLUMES WITHOUT ILLUMINATING BY SO MUCH AS A CANDLE'S RAY THE BLACK PROFOUND OF HIS OWN IGNORANCE OF THE MATTER
EXPOUNDS THE WISDOM VIRTUE AND POWER OF THE RABBLE ROUNDHEAD
WORDS DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT THE PERSON OF WHOM THEY ARE UTTERED IS DEVOID OF THE DIGNITY OF CHARACTER DISTINGUISHING HIM WHO UTTERS THEM IT MAY BE GRAPHIC MIMETIC OR MERELY RIDENT

DID I NOT GUESS TRULY IS IT NOT SOME BAD AFFAIR
D'ARTAGNAN LISTENED TO HIM WITH EXEMPLARY COMPLAISANCE AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAID AND MADAME BONACIEUX DO YOU KNOW WHO CARRIED HER OFF FOR I DO NOT FORGET THAT I OWE TO THAT UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
I FOUND A LETTER ON THE GREEN TABLE COVER IN YOUR BEDROOM AND WHERE IS THAT LETTER
AND ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THE GAME WHICH HE HAD NEVER PLAYED HE ACCEPTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TIME FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS IT THEN SCARCELY WAS TILL TWELVE THE TWO MUSKETEERS WERE ALREADY THERE AND WERE PLAYING TOGETHER
WELL THEN I COUNT ON YOU AT THE APPOINTED HOUR I SHALL BE READY
WAS BUSY GROOMING THEM AND HAD ALREADY FINISHED TWO
WHOSE RELATIVE AS WE ALREADY KNOW BERNAJOUX WAS
THE KING THEREFORE AROSE A MINUTE AFTER AND PUTTING THE MONEY WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM INTO HIS POCKET
BUT D'ARTAGNAN WITH HIS GASCON IMAGINATION SAW IN IT HIS FUTURE FORTUNE AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN GOLDEN DREAMS
WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO DESIGNATE DURING HIS ACCOUNT BY THE TITLE OF THE CARDINAL'S EXECUTIONER AND EXPATIATED AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE BASTILLE THE BOLTS THE WICKETS THE DUNGEONS THE GRATINGS THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
D'ARTAGNAN'S INTENTION WAS TO GO OUT WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE WORTHY MERCER BUT THE LATTER MADE SO POLITE AND FRIENDLY A SALUTATION THAT HIS TENANT FELT OBLIGED NOT ONLY TO STOP BUT TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM
THE TRIUMPH OF THE QUEEN AND THE HUMILIATION OF HIS EMINENCE YOU MUST LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF WHAT HAVE I TO FEAR REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN AS LONG AS I SHALL HAVE THE LUCK TO ENJOY THE FAVOR OF THEIR MAJESTIES EVERYTHING BELIEVE ME
HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
BRAVE YOUNG MAN MURMURED THE KING WELL HE DID REMAIN WITH THEM AND YOUR MAJESTY HAS IN HIM SO FIRM A CHAMPION THAT IT WAS HE WHO GAVE JUSSAC THE TERRIBLE SWORD THRUST WHICH HAS MADE THE CARDINAL SO ANGRY
RETURNED TO HIS HOTEL AND IMMEDIATELY SENT WORD TO THE FOUR FRIENDS THAT HE AWAITED THEIR COMPANY AT DINNER
THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY FELL UPON THE INCARCERATION OF THE POOR MAN
HEAVED A PROFOUND SIGH AND SET TO WORK TO GROOM THE THIRD HORSE
AND BY AND BY BY AND BY WE WILL SEE AH SIRE IT IS BECAUSE I CONFIDE IN THAT JUSTICE THAT I SHALL WAIT PATIENTLY AND QUIETLY THE GOOD PLEASURE OF YOUR MAJESTY
AND WE ARE GOING TO BE RECOMPENSED FOR OUR DILIGENCE CONTINUED THE MERCER
AND WHO HAVE I DARE AFFIRM TO THE KING HIS SERVICE MUCH AT HEART THREE OF MY BEST SOLDIERS I SAY
BERNAJOUX WAS NOT A MAN TO HAVE SUCH A COMPLIMENT PAID TO HIM TWICE IN AN INSTANT HIS SWORD GLITTERED IN HIS HAND AND HE SPRANG UPON HIS ADVERSARY WHOM
AND AS HE DECLARED HE WAS TOO IGNORANT OF THE GAME TO PLAY IT REGULARLY THEY ONLY CONTINUED GIVING BALLS TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT COUNTING
IN A TINE OF PERFECT GOOD FELLOWSHIP WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOU ALL THESE DAYS
DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARD THE LOUVRE BUT TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE KING HAD GONE STAG HUNTING IN THE FOREST OF SAINT GERMAIN
WOULD NOT ONE SAY HE WAS SPEAKING OF A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IN TRUTH MY DEAR CAPTAIN
LA VIEUVILLE SAID HE TAKE MY PLACE
IN ADDITION TO THE SWORD THRUST IN HIS ARM WHICH IS NOT DANGEROUS
WHICH SEIZE ME ALL AT ONCE AND I HAVE JUST FELT A COLD SHIVER PAY NO ATTENTION TO IT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO OCCUPY YOURSELF WITH BUT BEING HAPPY THEN I HAVE FULL OCCUPATION FOR I AM SO NOT YET WAIT A LITTLE THIS EVENING YOU SAID WELL
EXACTLY BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT LETTERS WHICH COME IN THIS WAY INTO SHUT UP HOUSES FALL FROM HEAVEN MY FRIEND FALL FROM HEAVEN
HIS EYES THEREFORE WERE FIXED IN A SORT OF AGONY UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE KING MUST ENTER
SHALL I GIVE YOU COUNSEL GOOD COUNSEL THE COUNSEL OF A FRIEND
WE FANCY THAT WE HAVE EACH CAUSE TO COMPLAIN OF THE OTHER AND I AM COME TO ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR UP THIS AFFAIR
AND PRESSING HIM WARMLY WITHOUT DOUBT WOULD SOON HAVE COMPLETED HIS WORK WITH A THIRD BLOW WHEN THE NOISE WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET BEING HEARD IN THE TENNIS COURT TWO OF THE FRIENDS OF THE GUARDSMAN WHO HAD SEEN HIM GO OUT AFTER EXCHANGING SOME WORDS WITH D'ARTAGNAN RUSHED SWORD IN HAND FROM THE COURT AND FELL UPON THE CONQUEROR
BRUSH OFF YOUR BOOTS YESTERDAY FROM THE PAVEMENT OF PARIS
IT IS WOMAN WHO HAS RUINED US STILL RUINS US AND WILL RUIN US AS LONG AS THE WORLD STANDS TAKE MY ADVICE AND SET OUT THIS EVENING
OF WHICH THE DOCTOR SAYS BAD THINGS
THEY SUCCEEDED IN CALMING THEIR FRIENDS WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HURLING SOME PAVING STONES AGAINST THE GATES BUT THE GATES WERE TOO STRONG THEY SOON TIRED OF THE SPORT BESIDES THOSE WHO MUST BE CONSIDERED THE LEADERS OF THE ENTERPRISE HAD QUIT THE GROUP AND WERE MAKING THEIR WAY
IT IS NOT NATURAL FOR LETTERS TO ENTER PEOPLE'S HOUSES IN THIS MANNER IF THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN OR EVEN AJAR I SHOULD THINK NOTHING OF IT BUT NO ALL WAS HERMETICALLY SEALED
BY WHOM DID THE QUEEN SEND YOU THIS JEWEL SHE GAVE IT TO ME HERSELF WHERE IN THE ROOM ADJOINING THE CHAMBER IN WHICH SHE CHANGED HER TOILET HOW GIVING ME HER HAND TO KISS
DID NOT INSPIRE HIM WITH THE LEAST SUSPICION OF HIS PRETTY HOSTESS
BUT I LEAVE YOUR MAJESTY TO JUDGE WHAT FIVE ARMED MEN COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING TO DO IN SUCH A DESERTED PLACE AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
HE WAS DRESSED AS A CITIZEN THE GUARDS OF THE CARDINAL PERCEIVING HIS YOUTH AND THAT HE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CORPS INVITED HIM TO RETIRE BEFORE THEY ATTACKED SO YOU MAY PLAINLY SEE TREVILLE INTERRUPTED THE KING IT WAS THEY WHO ATTACKED
AND KNOWS THAT I HAVE BEEN TO LONDON THE DEVIL YOU HAVE BEEN TO LONDON WAS IT FROM LONDON YOU BROUGHT THAT BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND THAT GLITTERS ON YOUR FINGER BEWARE MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN A PRESENT FROM AN ENEMY IS NOT A GOOD THING
AT LENGTH HE WENT TO BED FELL ASLEEP AND HAD GOLDEN DREAMS
AND THE TWO WILL PASS OFF TOGETHER
AH LIKE THE CHARMING JOURNEY THE OTHER DAY
PERHAPS THERE IS BUT ONE AT THIS MOMENT BUT BY THIS EVENING THERE WILL BE FOUR IT APPEARS THAT OUR JOURNEY WAS A REMOUNTING JOURNEY THEN EXACTLY SO SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND NODDING TO PLANCHET HE WENT OUT
REQUIRED THIS INTELLIGENCE TO BE REPEATED TO HIM TWICE AND EACH TIME HIS COMPANIONS SAW HIS BROW BECOME DARKER HAD HIS MAJESTY ASKED HE ANY INTENTION OF HOLDING THIS HUNTING PARTY YESTERDAY NO YOUR EXCELLENCY
AND AS D'ARTAGNAN STOOD FIRM IT WAS HIS ADVERSARY WHO MADE THE RETREATING STEP BUT D'ARTAGNAN SEIZED THE MOMENT AT WHICH IN THIS MOVEMENT THE SWORD OF BERNAJOUX DEVIATED FROM THE LINE HE FREED HIS WEAPON MADE A LUNGE AND TOUCHED HIS ADVERSARY ON THE SHOULDER
THERE ARE MANY THANKS TO BE OFFERED TO YOU AND TO BE TRANSMITTED TO YOU BE THIS EVENING ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT SAINT CLOUD
BUT I WILL NOT SWEAR TO IT SIRE YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AND UNLESS A MAN BE ENDOWED WITH THAT ADMIRABLE INSTINCT
AS HE PASSED THE HOTEL DES GARDES HE TOOK A GLANCE IN TO THE STABLES THREE OF THE FOUR HORSES HAD ALREADY ARRIVED
PASSED SO CLOSE TO D'ARTAGNAN'S FACE
WHEN HE WAS LEFT STIFF AS A RUSH IN LONDON IN THE INTERVENING TIME BUCKINGHAM PERHAPS SENT HIM TO PARIS AS HE DID THE HORSES HAS ANYONE BROUGHT A LETTER FOR ME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN EAGERLY
WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOUR THREE COMPANIONS
YOU'RE IN THE WRONG THERE FOR IF YOU KNEW MY NAME PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PRESSING WHAT IS YOUR NAME
HE HAD RETIRED AT ONE O'CLOCK UNDER THE PRETENSE OF BEING INDISPOSED AS TO THEIR MAJESTIES THEY DID NOT RETURN TO THE LOUVRE TILL SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING NOW SAID TREVILLE LOWERING HIS VOICE AND LOOKING INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE APARTMENT TO SEE IF THEY WERE ALONE
DO YOU KNOW THAT HIS EMINENCE HAS BEEN MAKING FRESH COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOUR MUSKETEERS
I AM GOING OUT FOR ALL DAY PERHAPS YOU ARE THEREFORE YOUR OWN MASTER TILL SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING BUT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK YOU MUST HOLD YOURSELF IN READINESS WITH TWO HORSES
WHICH MAY BETRAY HIM WHO WEARS IT SELL THIS RING A RING WHICH COMES FROM MY SOVEREIGN NEVER SAID D'ARTAGNAN THEN AT LEAST TURN THE GEM INSIDE YOU SILLY FELLOW FOR EVERYBODY MUST BE AWARE THAT A CADET FROM GASCONY
NOT ONLY AS GOOD COMRADES BUT AS MEN WHO HAD SO OFTEN HAD THEIR TURN THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL AFFORD HIM HIS
THIS EVENING WILL COME THANK GOD AND PERHAPS YOU LOOK FOR IT WITH AS MUCH IMPATIENCE AS I DO PERHAPS THIS EVENING MADAME BONACIEUX WILL VISIT THE CONJUGAL DOMICILE
HE SALUTED THE KING RESPECTFULLY AND WITH THIS AGREEMENT TOOK LEAVE OF HIM THAT EVENING THE THREE MUSKETEERS WERE INFORMED OF THE HONOR ACCORDED THEM AS THEY HAD LONG BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE KING THEY WERE NOT MUCH EXCITED
I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
SO TRIFLING INDEED THAT D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT PERCEIVE IT ANY MORE THAN HE HAD THE MOMENTARY SHADE WHICH AN INSTANT BEFORE HAD DARKENED THE COUNTENANCE OF THE WORTHY MAN AH MAY YOU BE A TRUE PROPHET SAID D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING NO
THAT IS TRUE SIRE THERE CAN BE NO MORE DOUBT ON THAT HEAD THEY CALLED UPON HIM THEN TO RETIRE BUT HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS A MUSKETEER AT HEART ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO YOUR MAJESTY
BESIDES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID A LITTLE CONDESCENSION TOWARD A HUSBAND WHOSE PRETTY WIFE HAS APPOINTED A MEETING WITH YOU THAT SAME EVENING AT SAINT CLOUD
THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THEIR YOUNG COMPANION GO OUT WHO AS HE HAD TOLD THE GUARDSMAN OF HIS EMINENCE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE DOOR AN INSTANT AFTER THE GUARDSMAN DESCENDED IN HIS TURN
NEITHER OF THEM HAD RETURNED THEIR LACKEYS LIKEWISE WERE ABSENT AND NOTHING HAD BEEN HEARD OF EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER
DECLARING THAT HE WOULD NOT RESUME THE GAME UNTIL HE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PLAY WITH THEM ON MORE EQUAL TERMS
HE WHO WOUNDED JUSSAC CRIED THE KING HE A BOY
IS ONLY THAT I MAY KNOW WHETHER I AM DELAYING YOU WHY THAT QUESTION MY DEAR HOST ASKED D'ARTAGNAN DO YOU INTEND TO SIT UP FOR ME NO BUT SINCE MY ARREST AND THE ROBBERY THAT WAS COMMITTED IN MY HOUSE I AM ALARMED EVERY TIME I HEAR A DOOR OPEN
TWO OR THREE TIMES BAH PREOCCUPIED AS MONSIEUR WAS WITH THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED HE DID NOT OBSERVE THAT BUT I WHOM THE STRANGE FASHION IN WHICH THAT LETTER CAME INTO THE HOUSE HAD PLACED ON MY GUARD I DID NOT LOSE A MOVEMENT OF HIS FEATURES
AND YOU FOUND IT TRAITOROUS MONSIEUR INDEED
PARTICULARLY IN THE NIGHT WHAT THE DEUCE CAN YOU EXPECT I AM NO SWORDSMAN WELL DON'T BE ALARMED IF I RETURN AT ONE TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
EVERYONE TO RETURN HOME AND WAIT FOR NEWS
AH THESE MUSKETEERS OF YOURS ARE VERY DEVILS FELLOWS TO BE HANGED NO SIRE REPLIED TREVILLE WHO SAW AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOW THINGS WOULD GO ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE GOOD CREATURES AS MEEK AS LAMBS AND HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE
THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME MAGIC UNDERNEATH MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN HAD DARTED IN TO HIS CHAMBER AND OPENED THE LETTER
TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS TO THE RESCUE
HIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY LOST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING NOW AS UPON THIS AUDIENCE IN HIS GASCON IMAGINATION DEPENDED HIS FUTURE LIFE HE SALUTED ARAMIS AND PORTHOS POLITELY
HIS HEART SWELLED BY THE INTOXICATION OF JOY FELT READY TO DISSOLVE AWAY AT THE VERY GATE OF THAT TERRESTRIAL PARADISE CALLED LOVE
LET US ADJURE HIM IN THE NAME OF THE GOD BEFORE WHOM HE MUST PERHAPS APPEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
THEN UPON SEEING MY MUSKETEERS THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND FORGOT THEIR PRIVATE HATRED FOR PARTISAN HATRED FOR YOUR MAJESTY CANNOT BE IGNORANT THAT THE MUSKETEERS WHO BELONG TO THE KING AND NOBODY BUT THE KING
MY DEAR PLANCHET I AM THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
NEVER MIND BE CONTENT I WILL DO MY BEST ON GUARD BUT SAID HE WHOM D'ARTAGNAN THUS PROVOKED IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS PLACE IS BADLY CHOSEN AND THAT WE SHOULD BE BETTER
AT THESE CRIES ALL WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL RUSHED OUT AND FELL UPON THE FOUR COMPANIONS WHO ON THEIR SIDE CRIED ALOUD TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS THIS CRY WAS GENERALLY HEEDED
ONE HARDLY A YOUNG MAN BUT WHO HOWEVER BEHAVED HIMSELF SO ADMIRABLY ON THIS OCCASION THAT I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF RECOMMENDING HIM TO YOUR MAJESTY HOW DOES HE CALL HIMSELF D'ARTAGNAN SIRE
BUT WHY THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WITH HIM I WATCHED YOU WITHOUT LISTENING TO YOU
WELL THEN OFF TO THE NEAREST GOLDSMITH'S AND SELL THAT DIAMOND FOR THE HIGHEST PRICE YOU CAN GET FROM HIM HOWEVER MUCH OF A JEW HE MAY BE HE WILL GIVE YOU AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED PISTOLES PISTOLES HAVE NO NAME YOUNG MAN AND THAT RING HAS A TERRIBLE ONE
AND A YOUTH NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR GROUND AGAINST FIVE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE OF THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN BUT ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT FOUR OF THEM TO EARTH WHY THIS IS A VICTORY CRIED THE KING ALL RADIANT A COMPLETE VICTORY
BUT ONE HAS COME OF ITSELF WHAT DO YOU MEAN BLOCKHEAD I MEAN TO SAY THAT WHEN I CAME IN ALTHOUGH I HAD THE KEY OF YOUR APARTMENT IN MY POCKET
LOOK AT ME AS LONG AS YOU LIKE MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE SAID
BUT ON THE CONTRARY FOR HIM WHOSE PEOPLE THE MUSKETEERS HAD ASSAULTED AND WHOSE HOTEL THEY HAD ENDEAVORED TO BURN NOW AS THE DEBATE BETWEEN THESE TWO NOBLES MIGHT LAST A LONG TIME EACH BECOMING NATURALLY MORE FIRM IN HIS OWN OPINION
D'ARTAGNAN FOUND THE MUSKETEER DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT AS THE HOUR TO WAIT UPON THE KING WAS NOT TILL TWELVE HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH PORTHOS AND ARAMIS TO PLAY A GAME AT TENNIS
LEST IT BE OBSERVED THAT WE GO OUT TOGETHER YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT FOR OUR UNDERTAKING COMPANY WOULD BE IN THE WAY THAT'S TRUE SAID THE GUARDSMAN ASTONISHED THAT HIS NAME HAD NOT PRODUCED MORE EFFECT UPON THE YOUNG MAN
AND HOW THE DEVIL DID YOU ESCAPE
THAT IS TRUE SAID THE KING BUT NEVER MIND TREVILLE COME STILL BY THE BACK STAIRCASE TREVILLE SMILED BUT AS IT WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO HAVE PREVAILED UPON THIS CHILD TO REBEL AGAINST HIS MASTER
THE CARDINAL IS NOT THE MAN TO FORGET A MYSTIFICATION UNTIL HE HAS SETTLED ACCOUNT WITH THE MYSTIFIER AND THE MYSTIFIER APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE THE AIR OF BEING A CERTAIN YOUNG GASCON OF MY ACQUAINTANCE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CARDINAL IS AS WELL POSTED AS YOURSELF
THE DOORS OF WHICH THEY CLOSED JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR ENEMIES FROM ENTERING WITH THEM AS TO THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN AT ONCE AND AS WE HAVE SAID IN A VERY BAD STATE
HER MAJESTY DID ME THE HONOR TO GRANT ME THAT FAVOR AND THAT IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES IMPRUDENT THRICE IMPRUDENT
HE REPAIRED THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HOTEL AND CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE ANNOUNCED THE TWO NOBLES SALUTED EACH OTHER POLITELY FOR IF NO FRIENDSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS AT LEAST ESTEEM BOTH WERE MEN OF COURAGE AND HONOR
AND LET US ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE KING BEFORE HE IS PREJUDICED BY THE CARDINAL
ARE THERE NOT SOME LATIN VERSES UPON THAT SUBJECT STOP YES DOUBTLESS REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
DOES NOT FIND SUCH STONES IN HIS MOTHER'S JEWEL CASE YOU THINK THEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO DREAD ASKED D'ARTAGNAN I MEAN TO SAY YOUNG MAN THAT HE WHO SLEEPS OVER A MINE THE MATCH OF WHICH IS ALREADY LIGHTED
SHUT HIS DOOR AND SET OFF AT A QUICK PACE IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
WHOM HE HAD SENT HOME TWO HOURS BEFORE FROM THE HOTEL DE VILLE TELLING HIM TO SIT UP FOR HIM OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM THE READER MAY ASK
SHUN IT WERE IT WITH A CHILD OF TEN YEARS OLD IF YOU ARE ATTACKED BY DAY OR BY NIGHT FIGHT BUT RETREAT WITHOUT SHAME IF YOU CROSS A BRIDGE FEEL EVERY PLANK OF IT WITH YOUR FOOT
WHO WAS WAITING FOR THEM ALREADY INFORMED OF THIS FRESH DISTURBANCE
NOW LET US TALK ABOUT YOURSELF MY YOUNG FRIEND
BEWARE OF THE ENEMY WHO MAKES YOU PRESENTS
NOT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL I AM ABOUT TO MAKE TO YOU
DETAINED BY AN ACCUSATION OF COINING
YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE SCRIPTURES
ALTHOUGH HE PLAYED WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE FOUND THAT HIS WOUND WAS YET TOO RECENT TO ALLOW OF SUCH EXERTION
PERFECTLY DOES HE TALK WITH DIFFICULTY BUT HE CAN SPEAK
THE MASTER OF THE HOUNDS CAME THIS MORNING TO INFORM HIM THAT HE HAD MARKED DOWN A STAG AT FIRST THE KING ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD NOT GO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST HIS LOVE OF SPORT AND SET OUT AFTER DINNER AND THE KING HAS SEEN THE CARDINAL
WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
GENTLEMEN I WILL SEE THE KING THIS EVENING BUT AS TO YOU I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO RISK DOING SO THIS ADVICE WAS TOO REASONABLE AND MOREOVER CAME FROM A MAN WHO KNEW THE KING TOO WELL TO ALLOW THE FOUR YOUNG MEN TO DISPUTE IT
FAR FROM HERE OH LORD NO ABOUT FORTY LEAGUES ONLY
BY THE BY YOU CAN BE SURE OF YOUR LACKEY MISTRUST EVERYBODY YOUR FRIEND YOUR BROTHER YOUR MISTRESS YOUR MISTRESS ABOVE ALL D'ARTAGNAN BLUSHED MY MISTRESS ABOVE ALL REPEATED HE MECHANICALLY
WHERE MY FRIENDS STILL REMAIN AND YOU HAVE RETURNED HAVE YOU NOT
YOU ARE RIGHT TREVILLE BUT THEY WERE NOT ALONE YOUR MUSKETEERS THEY HAD A YOUTH WITH THEM YES SIRE AND ONE WOUNDED MAN SO THAT THREE OF THE KING'S MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM WAS WOUNDED
I PREFER TRAVELING ALONE TO HAVING A COMPANION WHO ENTERTAINS THE LEAST FEAR
NO BUT THANKS TO THIS DIAMOND REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN
BUT YOUR COMPANIONS I DON'T THINK THEY CAN BE IN NEED OF ANY WE LEFT PARIS EACH WITH SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES IN HIS POCKET SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE
THAT D'ARTAGNAN COULD NOT HELP PERCEIVING IT AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER
AND ALL THE FAULT IS WITH YOUR MUSKETEERS
PLACING HIS HAND UPON HIS HIP SIRE RESUMED TREVILLE AS I TOLD YOU
TO HIS EMINENCE THUS THE SOLDIERS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE RED DUKE AS ARAMIS HAD CALLED HIM OFTEN TOOK PART WITH THE KING'S MUSKETEERS IN THESE QUARRELS
AND THE MOMENT THE TWO GUARDSMEN ATTACKED THEIR YOUNG COMPANION DROVE THEM BACK BERNAJOUX NOW FELL AND AS THE GUARDSMEN WERE ONLY TWO AGAINST FOUR THEY BEGAN TO CRY TO THE RESCUE
AH THAT'S QUITE ANOTHER THING BUT PROMISE ME IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE KILLED TONIGHT THAT YOU WILL GO TOMORROW I PROMISE IT DO YOU NEED MONEY
WE ARE GOING AGAIN IT APPEARS TO HAVE OUR HIDES PIERCED IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS YOU WILL TAKE YOUR MUSKETOON AND YOUR PISTOLS
AH I HAD EIGHTY LOUIS BEFORE ME PUT DOWN THE SAME SUM SO THAT THEY WHO HAVE LOST MAY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF JUSTICE BEFORE EVERYTHING
ARE THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE GUARDSMEN WHO BELONG TO THE CARDINAL YES TREVILLE YES SAID THE KING IN A MELANCHOLY TONE AND IT IS VERY SAD BELIEVE ME TO SEE THUS TWO PARTIES IN FRANCE TWO HEADS TO ROYALTY
THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU WHY SO PLANCHET ASKED THE YOUNG MAN
HE FOUND THE DOOR OF HIS PASSAGE OPEN SPRANG UP THE STAIRS AND KNOCKED SOFTLY IN A MANNER AGREED UPON BETWEEN HIM AND HIS LACKEY
IT IS AS I HAVE THE HONOR TO RELATE IT TO YOUR MAJESTY JUSSAC ONE OF THE FIRST SWORDSMEN IN THE KINGDOM WELL SIRE FOR ONCE HE FOUND HIS MASTER I WILL SEE THIS YOUNG MAN TREVILLE I WILL SEE HIM AND IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE
HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE REMARKED IT
IT IS USELESS TO LET THE CARDINAL KNOW YES SIRE YOU UNDERSTAND TREVILLE AN EDICT IS STILL AN EDICT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT AFTER ALL BUT THIS ENCOUNTER SIRE IS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF A DUEL IT IS A BRAWL
OH THE WOMEN THE WOMEN CRIED THE OLD SOLDIER I KNOW THEM BY THEIR ROMANTIC IMAGINATION EVERYTHING THAT SAVORS OF MYSTERY CHARMS THEM SO YOU HAVE SEEN THE ARM THAT WAS ALL YOU WOULD MEET THE QUEEN AND SHE WOULD NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE
DOMESTICS IN DARING TO MAKE A SORTIE UPON THE KING'S MUSKETEERS THE PROPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE AND RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM WHEN FORTUNATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK
WHO HASTENED TO THE SUCCOR OF THEIR COMRADES THE MELEE BECAME GENERAL BUT STRENGTH WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE MUSKETEERS
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU MY DEAR HOST SO MUCH THE WORSE WHEN I AM HAPPY I WISH ALL THE WORLD TO BE SO BUT IT APPEARS THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE THE YOUNG MAN DEPARTED LAUGHING AT THE JOKE WHICH HE THOUGHT HE ALONE COULD COMPREHEND AMUSE YOURSELF WELL REPLIED BONACIEUX
THEY MERIT RICHLY THAT PIECE OF ATTENTION ON YOUR PART
HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
HE HOPED TO INTIMIDATE BUT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ON THE PRECEDING DAY SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP FRESH SHARPENED BY HIS VICTORY FULL OF HOPES OF FUTURE FAVOR HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO RECOIL A STEP SO THE TWO SWORDS WERE CROSSED CLOSE TO THE HILTS
WHO CERTAINLY DID NOT GO THERE IN SUCH A NUMEROUS COMPANY WITHOUT SOME ILL INTENTION AGAINST THE EDICTS AH AH YOU INCLINE ME TO THINK SO SAID THE KING THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WENT THITHER TO FIGHT THEMSELVES I DO NOT ACCUSE THEM SIRE
AS I SEE THERE IS NO CONCEALING ANYTHING FROM YOU YES I WAS EXPECTED AND VERY IMPATIENTLY I ACKNOWLEDGE
PLACED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AS BERNAJOUX WAS HE HAD NO IDEA FOR A MOMENT OF CONCEALING THE TRUTH AND HE DESCRIBED TO THE TWO NOBLES THE AFFAIR EXACTLY AS IT HAD PASSED
FOR THAT VERY EVENING BUT WE ARE BOUND TO SAY TO THE CREDIT OF OUR HERO
AH YOUNG MAN YOUNG MAN SOME FLIRTATION OR OTHER
AT ALL EVENTS YOUNG MAN RELY UPON ONE WHO HAS BEEN THIRTY YEARS AT COURT DO NOT LULL YOURSELF IN SECURITY OR YOU WILL BE LOST BUT ON THE CONTRARY AND IT IS I WHO SAY IT SEE ENEMIES IN ALL DIRECTIONS IF ANYONE SEEKS A QUARREL WITH YOU
WITH A LETTER IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HIM TO EJECT THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO REPRIMAND HIS PEOPLE FOR THEIR AUDACITY IN MAKING SORTIE AGAINST THE KING'S MUSKETEERS
WHICH WAS FIXED FOR MIDDAY HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND AND SEEING THAT THE STREET WAS EMPTY SAID TO HIS ADVERSARY MY FAITH IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU ALTHOUGH YOUR NAME IS BERNAJOUX TO HAVE ONLY TO DEAL WITH AN APPRENTICE MUSKETEER
EXCITEMENT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AMONG THE MUSKETEERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THEY EVEN BEGAN TO DELIBERATE WHETHER THEY SHOULD NOT SET FIRE TO THE HOTEL
WHY IT IS INDEED A TRUE ROYAL JEWEL
WHICH THE LIBERALITY OF D'ARTAGNAN HAD NOT ENTIRELY EFFACED LEFT ALONE D'ARTAGNAN READ AND REREAD HIS BILLET THEN HE KISSED AND REKISSED TWENTY TIMES THE LINES TRACED BY THE HAND OF HIS BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS
LEST ONE SHOULD GIVE WAY BENEATH YOU IF YOU PASS BEFORE A HOUSE WHICH IS BEING BUILT LOOK UP FOR FEAR A STONE SHOULD FALL UPON YOUR HEAD IF YOU STAY OUT LATE BE ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY YOUR LACKEY AND LET YOUR LACKEY BE ARMED IF
THE DEVIL SAID D'ARTAGNAN
IN WHOSE SERVICE HE HAD A RELATIVE
THE DEVIL WHAT MUST I DO ABOVE ALL THINGS BE ALWAYS ON YOUR GUARD THE CARDINAL HAS A TENACIOUS MEMORY AND A LONG ARM YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT HE WILL REPAY YOU BY SOME ILL TURN BUT OF WHAT SORT
HIS VISIT OF THE DAY BEFORE IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED HAD BEEN VERY SHORT AND VERY LITTLE EXPLICATIVE HE FOUND TREVILLE IN A JOYFUL MOOD HE HAD THOUGHT THE KING AND QUEEN CHARMING AT THE BALL IT IS TRUE THE CARDINAL HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY ILL TEMPERED
YES SIRE AS THEY ALWAYS DO AND HOW DID THE THING HAPPEN LET US SEE FOR YOU KNOW MY DEAR CAPTAIN A JUDGE MUST HEAR BOTH SIDES GOOD LORD IN THE MOST SIMPLE AND NATURAL MANNER POSSIBLE
ALL WHITE WITH BLOSSOM AND THE CHILD BEGAN SINGING AS SHE WENT SHE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHY BUT I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD MADE HER FEEL GLAD THE PATH WOUND ALONG THROUGH THE TREES AND AS IT GREW WIDER AFTER TURNING A CORNER
AND OFTEN ENOUGH A DANGEROUS YET WITH EXTRAORDINARY DEFTNESS SHE TREADS IT SHE MUST WIN HER A MATE
AND SHRILL GENTEEL SCREAM O YOU MISGUIDED DINNER GIVING SNOBS THINK HOW MUCH PLEASURE YOU LOSE AND HOW MUCH MISCHIEF YOU DO WITH YOUR ABSURD GRANDEURS AND HYPOCRISIES YOU STUFF EACH OTHER WITH UNNATURAL FORCED MEATS
HE SAID I HEAR THAT YOU KEEP A FAR BETTER HOUSE THAN I HOW DARE YOU DO SUCH A THING DON'T YOU KNOW THAT NO MAN IN THE LAND OUGHT TO LIVE BETTER THAN THE KING AND I TELL YOU THAT NO MAN SHALL O KING SAID THE ABBOT
WHO REFLECTS THAT SHE HAS NEVER BEEN THERE THE WIDOW IS VEXED OUT OF PATIENCE BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER MARIA HAS GOT A PLACE BESIDE YOUNG CAMBRIC THE PENNILESS CURATE AND NOT BY COLONEL GOLDMORE THE RICH WIDOWER FROM INDIA
THE PRINCIPAL TONE NEXT THE HIGHEST TONE THIRD
AS SOME ONE OUGHT TO HAVE SAID ARE EXCELLENT THINGS IN WOMAN OTHER MEN EQUALLY FOOLISH HAVE REGARDED GIRLS AS PLAYTHINGS I WISH THESE MEN HAD TRIED TO PLAY WITH THEM THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT THEY WERE PLAYING WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
ANSWER MY FIRST QUESTION HOW LONG SHALL I LIVE COME YOU MUST TELL ME TO THE VERY DAY YOU SHALL LIVE SAID THE SHEPHERD UNTIL THE DAY THAT YOU DIE AND NOT ONE DAY LONGER AND YOU SHALL DIE WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR LAST BREATH
MUCH ENDURING YOUTHFUL HUMAN SOULS SHOULD BE THE SPORT OF WHAT SEEMS TO HIM
AND BELGRAVIA EVEN TO THE REMOTEST CORNER OF BRUNSWICK SQUARE PEACOCKS FEATHERS ARE STUCK IN THE TAILS OF MOST FAMILIES SCARCE ONE OF US DOMESTIC BIRDS BUT IMITATES THE LANKY
THE SERVANTS ARE NOT SERVANTS BUT THE BEFORE MENTIONED RETAIL TRADESMEN THE PLATE IS NOT PLATE BUT A MERE SHINY BIRMINGHAM LACQUER AND SO IS THE HOSPITALITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE TALK IS BIRMINGHAM TALK THE WAG OF THE PARTY
AND I AM TO SEE HOW SHE IS AND TELL MOTHER WHEN I GET BACK SAID THE CHILD WITH A SMILE AND SAID THE WOLF
AND ANOTHER BY SOMETHING UNNOTICED BY THE THRONG BUT AN SHE DISSEMBLES ONE IOTA TOO MUCH HER FELLOW FARERS LOOK ASKANCE AND HE WHO EVENTUALLY JOINS HER FOR GOOD UPBRAIDS HER FOR THAT BY WHICH SHE WON
IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND BUT BUT FEW THINGS MYSTIFY POOR LAW ABIDING MAN THAN THIS THAT THE CENTRAL THE PROFOUNDEST THE MOST PORTENTOUS PUZZLE OF THE UNIVERSE THE WEAL OF WOE OF TWO HIGH ASPIRING
AN IMPERFECT TRILL IS ONE CLOSING WITHOUT A TURN SIXTY SIX
GROWLED THE WOLF SPRINGING UP SUDDENLY AT RED RIDING HOOD BUT JUST AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND TWO TALL WOOD CUTTERS
ICES SWEETS CHAMPAGNE DRIVES CHURCH GOINGS AND SOMETIMES SPOT CASH MEN ARE ALWAYS WISHING THEY KNEW ALL ABOUT GIRLS IT IS A PRECIOUS GOOD THING THAT THEY DON'T
FOR WHOM FINALLY WOULD I WISH TO CATER MORE GENEROUSLY THAN FOR YOUR VERY HUMBLE SERVANT THE PRESENT WRITER NOW NOBODY SUPPOSES THAT THE BIRMINGHAM PLATE IS HAD OUT THE DISGUISED CARPET BEATERS
SHALL BE THE WINNER OF THE GAME SO THE WOLF TROTTED OFF ONE WAY AND RED RIDING HOOD WENT THE OTHER AND I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT SHE LINGERED AND LOITERED MORE THAN SHE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE ON THE ROAD WELL WHAT WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER
TO PEEP AT THE CHILD WHO WAS SO LIKE THEM IT WAS ON A BRIGHT SPRING MORNING EARLY IN MAY WHEN LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD HAD JUST FINISHED PUTTING AWAY THE BREAKFAST CUPS THAT HER MOTHER CAME BUSTLING IN FROM THE DAIRY
HAVE SOUGHT FOR AND ASSERTED THE EXISTENCE OF THE IDEAL GIRL THIS IS SHEER NONSENSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AND IF THERE WERE SHE COULD NOT COMPARE WITH THE REAL GIRL
TO A HANDSOME COMFORTABLE DINNER SERVICE OF PLATE NOT INCLUDING PLATES FOR I HOLD SILVER PLATES TO BE SHEER WANTONNESS AND WOULD ALMOST AS SOON THINK OF SILVER TEACUPS A COUPLE OF NEAT TEAPOTS A COFFEEPOT
THAN THE HIGH SPIRITED HIGH BRED GIRL OF THIS SHE IS QUITE AWARE TO OUR COST I SPEAK AS A MAN THE CONSEQUENCE IS HER PRICE HAS GONE UP AND MAN HAS TO PAY HIGH AND PAY ALL SORTS OF THINGS
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD IN A GREAT WIDE FOREST FULL OF BEAUTIFUL TREES AND GREEN GLADES AND THORNY THICKETS THERE LIVED A LONG TIME AGO A WOOD CUTTER AND HIS WIFE
YOUNG WOMEN THEMSELVES BUT RARELY UNSOPHISTICATED VIEW WITH A CERTAIN PITYING SORT OF CURIOSITY UNSOPHISTICATEDNESS IN MEN AND A YOUNG MAN'S UNSOPHISTICATEDENESS IT IS A GREAT DELIGHT TO A WOMAN TO ERADICATE YET
AS IT IS THAT OF WHICH YOU PARTAKE YOURSELF FOR TOWARDS WHAT WOMAN IN THE WORLD DO I ENTERTAIN A HIGHER REGARD THAN TOWARDS THE BELOVED PARTNER OF MY EXISTENCE MISSUS SNOB WHO SHOULD HAVE A GREATER PLACE IN MY AFFECTIONS
DINNER GIVING SNOBS FURTHER CONSIDERED IF MY FRIENDS WOULD BUT FOLLOW THE PRESENT PREVAILING FASHION I THINK THEY OUGHT TO GIVE ME A TESTIMONIAL FOR THE PAPER ON DINNER GIVING SNOBS WHICH I AM NOW WRITING
HERE'S YOUR BASKET AND DON'T BE TOO LONG AWAY HONEY SO LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
NOT THAT THIS IS IN ANY WAY DISPARAGING TO THE GIRLS THE FACT IS A GIRL IS AN INFINITE PUZZLE AND IT IS THIS PUZZLE THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS
WHEN SHE CROSSED THE LAST MEADOW FROM THE MILL
TO THE MAN OF HER OWN FREE LAWLESS CHOICE A GIRL IS ALWAYS LOYAL TO SUBSEQUENT AND SUBORDINATE ATTACHMENTS SHE IS DUTIFUL SO EVEN THE RENEGADE IF LOVED BY A GIRL WILL BE UPHELD BY THAT GIRL THROUGH THICK AND THIN
AND SEE THE MYRIADS WHO ARE NOT SO FORTUNATE TO WEAR HONEST LINEN WHILE MAGNIFICOS OF THE WORLD ARE ADORNED WITH CAMBRIC AND POINT LACE SURELY WE OUGHT TO HOLD AS MISERABLE ENVIOUS FOOLS
THAN HER SIX BROTHERS THREE OR FOUR OF WHOM WE ARE PRETTY SURE WILL FAVOUR US WITH THEIR COMPANY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK OR HER ANGELIC MOTHER
IF SHE MAKE TEST OF MANY ADMIRERS SHE IS DESCRIBED AS A FLIRT IF CONSCIENTIOUS AND DEMURE SHE AWAIT HER FATE A DESIRABLE FATE IS BY NO MEANS ASSURED IN TRUTH IT SEEMS THAT TOO OFTEN A GIRL MUST DISSEMBLE
WHEN THEY ASK US TO DINE IF IT BE PLEASANT TO DINE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AS ALL PERSONS WITH GOOD STOMACHS AND KINDLY HEARTS WILL I PRESUME ALLOW IT TO BE IT IS BETTER TO DINE TWICE THAN TO DINE ONCE
THAN A GIRL WITH NONE SHE KNOWS MORE OF MEN ESPECIALLY OF THEIR WEAKNESSES AND IDIOSYNCRASIES AND TO KNOW THE WEAKNESSES AND IDIOSYNCRASIES OF MEN IS PERHAPS A WIFE'S CHIEF TASK UNLESS IT BE TO PUT UP WITH THEM
DOWN WHICH THEY SLIDE DURING THE DINNER TIME WAYLAYING THE DISHES AS THEY COME OUT AND FINGERING THE ROUND BUMPS ON THE JELLIES AND THE FORCED MEAT BALLS IN THE SOUP NOBODY I SAY SUPPOSES THAT A DINNER AT HOME IS CHARACTERIZED BY
ONE WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE TO DIVIDE THE PRINCIPAL TONE INTO HALVES THEN THE APPOGGIATURA RECEIVES ONE HALF THE VALUE OF THE PRINTED NOTE
SECRETLY IT MAY BE FOR OFTEN THE GIRL NEVERTHELESS DEVOTEDLY AND ONLY UNDER COMPULSION WILL HE LISTEN TO THE DETRACTOR HE MAY DESERT HER OR IF HE STICKS TO HER HE MAY BEAT HER NO MATTER HE HOLDS HER HEART
BUT THIS IS A THORNY SUBJECT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT ALL MEN LOVE ALL GIRLS THE MAID OF SWEET SIXTEEN EQUALLY WITH THE MAID OF UNTOLD AGE THERE IS SOMETHING EXASPERATINGLY SOMETHING OR OTHERISH ABOUT GIRLS AND THEY KNOW IT
THE SENIOR UNITED SERVICE HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE JOINT ONE AND THREE AND HALF PINT OF SHERRY NINE AND IF HIS GRACE WHY NOT YOU AND I THIS RULE I HAVE MADE AND FOUND THE BENEFIT OF
OFTEN ENOUGH A PREPOSTEROUS ASSUMPTION WITH IT SHE IS LOOKED UPON TOO MUCH AND ALWAYS ALWAYS A GIRL HAS TO PRETEND THAT NEVER DID SHE DESCEND TO DISSEMBLANCE
POOR GRANNIE MUST HAVE TO BE SURE TO MAKE HER SO HOARSE THOUGHT THE CHILD THEN SHE PULLED THE BOBBIN AND THE LATCH WENT UP AND RED RIDING HOOD PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND STEPPED INSIDE THE COTTAGE IT SEEMED VERY DARK IN THERE
ARE THEY GIVEN THE REIN FOR A SINGLE PASSING MOMENT INSTEAD OF BEING ACCOUNTED UNTO HER FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY WORK HER RUIN SHE MUST WIN HER ONE MAN AND SHE MUST WIN HIM FOR LIFE BUT SHE CANNOT PICK OR CHOOSE FOR SHE MUST WAIT TO BE ASKED
FATE HAS COMFORTABLY APPOINTED GOLD PLATE FOR SOME AND HAS BIDDEN OTHERS CONTENTEDLY TO WEAR THE WILLOW PATTERN AND BEING PERFECTLY CONTENTED INDEED HUMBLY THANKFUL FOR LOOK AROUND O JONES
IN MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE WHICH WILL NOT SOPHISTICATE HER THE INTEGRAL OF LOVE YET IN THE SHORT YEARS BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY A GIRL'S LOVE WILL UNDERGO RAPID AND STARTLING DEVELOPMENTS
AND WHERE MAY YOU BE GOING SWEET LASS SAID THE WOLF AS HE WALKED BESIDE HER OH GRANNIE ISN'T VERY WELL AND MOTHER CANNOT LEAVE THE CHEESE MAKING THIS MORNING AND SO I'M TAKING HER SOME LITTLE DAINTIES IN MY BASKET
THE DOCTOR'S WIFE IS SULKY BECAUSE SHE HAS NOT BEEN LED OUT BEFORE THE BARRISTER'S LADY OLD DOCTOR CORK IS GRUMBLING AT THE WINE AND GUTTLETON SNEERING AT THE COOKERY AND TO THINK THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE MIGHT BE SO HAPPY
TO PROVE HERSELF WHOLE HEARTED FOR OF COURSE ALWAYS EVERY SUITOR EXPECTS WHOLE HEARTEDNESS AND THIS EVERY GIRL INSTINCTIVELY KNOWS INDEED IS NOT A HALF HEARTED LOVE OR A HALF HEARTED ACCEPTRESS OF LOVE A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS
LEST THERE BE ANY DISASTER THERE IF THE SOUFFLE SHOULD COLLAPSE OR IF WIGGINS DOES NOT SEND THE ICES IN TIME SHE FEELS AS IF SHE WOULD COMMIT SUICIDE THAT SMILING JOLLY WOMAN THE CHILDREN UPSTAIRS ARE YELLING
SINCE EVEN IF A CLANDESTINE ENGAGEMENT AS IS USUALLY THE CASE IS MERELY A FLIRTATION WITH THE EMOLUMENTS
HATEFUL AS DISSEMBLANCE IN MEN T'IS A HARD ROAD INDEED THAT A GIRL HAS TO TRAVEL TO WIN HER A FELLOW FARER FOR LIFE SHE MUST GO OUT OF HER WAY TO ACCOMMODATE SO MANY TRAVELERS AND THIS ONE IS LURED BY THIS AND THAT ONE BY THAT
IF YOU FAIL TO ANSWER MY THREE QUESTIONS YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR HEAD I AM READY TO ANSWER THEM O KING SAID THE SHEPHERD INDEED INDEED SAID THE KING AND HE LAUGHED TO HIMSELF WELL THEN
AND WITH A GREAT TRAIN OF SERVANTS SET OUT FOR LONDON OF COURSE THE KING DID NOT KNOW HIM WELCOME SIR ABBOT HE SAID IT IS A GOOD THING THAT YOU HAVE COME BACK BUT PROMPT AS YOU ARE
OVER HIS SHEPHERD'S COAT HE THREW THE ABBOT'S LONG GOWN AND HE BOR ROWED THE ABBOT'S CAP AND GOLDEN STAFF WHEN ALL WAS READY NO ONE IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS NOT THE GREAT MAN HIMSELF THEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE
AND OH OH GRANNIE CRIED THE CHILD IN A SAD FRIGHT
RUN BEFORE THEM AND AFTER THEM SWEAR BY THEM AND AT THEM AND A BIT OF A CHIT OF A THING IN SHORT SKIRTS AND LISLE THREAD STOCKINGS WILL TWIST ABLE BODIED MALES ROUND HER LITTLE FINGER IT IS AN OPEN SECRET THAT GIRLS ARE FONDER OF MEN
HERE'S A TO DO SHE SAID FARMER HODGE HAS THIS VERY MINUTE TOLD ME THAT HE HEARS YOUR GRANNIE ISN'T QUITE WELL AND I CAN'T LEAVE THE CHEESE MAKING THIS MORNING FOR LOVE OR MONEY DO YOU GO MY DEAR
ALWAYS THE GIRL KNOWS WHETHER THE PLAY IS LEADING SHE PROBABLY CHOOSES THE GAME VERY LATE IN LIFE DOES A MAN LEARN THE TRUTH AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT ANCIENT PROVERB THAT KISSING GOES BY FAVOUR FOR
THE TURN COMES AT THE VERY END BUT IN BOTH CASES THE TIME TAKEN BY THE EMBELLISHMENT IS TAKEN FROM THE TIME VALUE OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTE FOR FURTHER DETAILS
IT WAS NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE GRACES OF ALL SORTS
THAN THEY ARE OF ONE ANOTHER WHICH IS VERY LUCKY FOR THE MEN GIRLS DIFFER AND THE SAME GIRL IS DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN SHE IS BY HERSELF SHE IS ONE THING WHEN SHE IS WITH OTHER GIRLS SHE IS ANOTHER THING WHEN SHE IS WITH A LOT OF MEN
AND THE BRAVE KNIGHTS WHO ARE WITH ME THINK ILL OF YOU SAID THE KING HOW CAN I HELP BUT THINK ILL OF YOU ALL THAT THERE IS IN THIS BROAD LAND IS MINE BY RIGHT AND HOW DO YOU DARE TO PUT ME TO SHAME
IS ALWAYS ACCENTED BUT THE ACCIACCATURA NEVER IS THE STRESS ALWAYS FALLING ON THE MELODY TONE SEE GROVE
AS THEIR MAID IS CRIMPING THEIR MISERABLE RINGLETS WITH HOT TONGS TEARING MISS EMMY'S HAIR OUT BY THE ROOTS OR SCRUBBING MISS POLLY'S DUMPY NOSE
IS SCORNFUL AND INDIGNANT WITH THE PAIR OF THEM BECAUSE HE IS KEPT OUT OF COURT YOUNG MUSCADEL THAT CHEAP DANDY IS TALKING FASHION AND ALMACK'S OUT OF THE MORNING POST AND DISGUSTING HIS NEIGHBOUR MISSUS FOX
A RICH OLD ABBOT WHO LIVED IN GRAND STYLE IN A GREAT HOUSE CALLED THE ABBEY EVERY DAY A HUNDRED NOBLE MEN SAT DOWN WITH HIM TO DINE AND FIFTY BRAVE KNIGHTS IN FINE VELVET COATS AND GOLD CHAINS
FOR NOW HE HAD NOT A WEEK TO LIVE
CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE APHORISM ARE SELDOM COUCHED IN SUCH TERMS THAT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS THEY SOUND PRECISELY OR ACCORDING TO THE WIDEST EXTENT OF SIGNIFICATION BUT DO COMMONLY NEED EXPOSITION AND ADMIT EXCEPTION
AS IF IT WERE ONE OF THE AMUSEMENTS OF LIFE BUT A DAY COMES WHEN LOVE PROVES ITSELF THE MOST SENSUOUS THING ON EARTH AND A GIRL IS QUICK TO DISCOVER THE KIND OF LOVE THAT IS REQUIRED OF HER AS A RULE MANY A GIRL WHO HAS BEEN SORE PUT TO IT
THE HORRIBLE CEREMONY THE FOOLISH MAKESHIFTS THE MEAN POMP AND OSTENTATION WHICH DISTINGUISH OUR BANQUETS ON GRAND FIELD DAYS SUCH A NOTION IS MONSTROUS I WOULD AS SOON THINK OF HAVING MY DEAREST BESSY
OF SUSTAINING TONE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME BUT WITH THE ADVENT OF THE MODERN PIANO WITH ITS COMPARATIVELY GREAT SUSTAINING POWER AND ALSO WITH THE ADVENT IN VOCAL MUSIC OF A NEW STYLE OF SINGING GERMAN LIEDER SINGING AS CONTRASTED
ALEXIS SOYER THE REGENERATOR WHAT HE IN HIS NOBLE STYLE WOULD CALL THE MOST SUCCULENT SAVOURY AND ELEGANT PASSAGES ARE THOSE WHICH RELATE NOT TO THE GRAND BANQUETS AND CEREMONIAL DINNERS BUT TO HIS DINNERS AT HOME
INTRODUCED TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE NEAT PARLOUR MAID THE MISERABLE ENTREES FROM THE PASTRYCOOK'S ORDERED IN AND THE CHILDREN PACKED OFF AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO THE NURSERY BUT REALLY ONLY TO THE STAIRCASE
SAD NEWS SAD NEWS SAID THE ABBOT AND THEN HE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED CHEER UP CHEER UP GOOD MASTER SAID THE SHEPHERD HAVE YOU NEVER YET HEARD
SHE MAKES BELIEVE TO BE CAPTURED
BUT INTERFERE THWART AND SUPPLANT ONE ANOTHER ISSAC BARROW THE VERY ESSENCE OF AN APHORISM IS THAT SLIGHT EXAGGERATION WHICH MAKES IT MORE BITING WHILST LESS RIGIDLY ACCURATE LESLIE STEPHEN
SO LEND ME YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR HORSE AND YOUR GOWN AND I WILL GO UP TO LONDON AND SEE THE KING IF NOTHING ELSE CAN BE DONE I CAN AT LEAST DIE IN YOUR PLACE
WAS AT THE TIME WHEN ALL THE BIRDS AND BEASTS OR VERY NEARLY ALL COULD SPEAK JUST AS WELL AS YOU OR I AND NOBODY WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THEM TALK AS I SUPPOSE ONE WOULD BE NOWADAYS WELL
THE MASCULINE MIND IS THE SLAVE OF LAW AND JUSTICE APHRODITE NEVER HEARD OF LAW OR JUSTICE SHE WAS BORN AT SEA THAT IS TO SAY FEW ARE THE MEN WHO AT SOME TIME IN THEIR LIVES HAVE NOT WONDERED AT THE VAGARIES
SHOULD BE AS ATTACHED AS MUCH IMPORTANCE AS TO THE WEDDING RING INDEED
SHE IS A THIRD SORT OF THING WHEN SHE IS WITH A MAN BUT THIS BAFFLED EVEN AGUR THE SON OF JAKEH AS A RULE A MAN PREFERS A GIRL BY HERSELF THIS IS NATURAL
AND SET OFF DOWN THE SUNNY GREEN SLOPE WITH HER BASKET IN HER HAND AT A BRISK PACE BUT AS SHE GOT DEEPER INTO THE FOREST SHE WALKED MORE SLOWLY EVERYTHING WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THE GREAT TREES WAVED THEIR HUGE ARMS OVER HER
THEN THE WOLF STRETCHED OUT HIS LARGE HAIRY PAWS AND BEGAN TO UNFASTEN THE BASKET OH SAID RED RIDING HOOD WHAT GREAT ARMS YOU HAVE GRANNIE
CHAPTER SIX EMBELLISHMENTS SIXTY FOUR EMBELLISHMENTS OR GRACES
IS SOMETIMES CALLED A TRANSIENT SHAKE BECAUSE IT IS REALLY ONLY A PART OF THE MORE ELABORATE GRACE CALLED TRILL
AND I HAVE COME TO BEG YOUR PARDON FOR HIM AND FOR ME AND WITH THAT HE THREW OFF HIS LONG GOWN THE KING LAUGHED LOUD AND LONG A MERRY FELLOW YOU ARE SAID HE
AND TO FLAUNT HIS MAGNIFICENT FAN TAIL IN THE SUNSHINE THE JAYS WITH PEACOCKS FEATHERS ARE THE SNOBS OF THIS WORLD AND NEVER SINCE THE DAYS OF AESOP WERE THEY MORE NUMEROUS IN ANY LAND
INVERTED MORDENT OR PRALL TRILL TURN GRUPPETTO INVERTED TURN APPOGGIATURA
IS SHE ABUNDANTLY ENDOWED WITH THE VERY ATTRIBUTES THAT MAKE FOR WIFE AND MOTHER HOOD A STRONG AND SWAYING PASSION AND AN AFFECTION UNBOUNDED SHE MUST HOLD THEM IN LEASH WITH EXEMPLARY PATIENCE FOR ALAS
A WOMAN THINKS SHE DETECTS SERIOUSNESS IN FLIPPANCY WHAT WOULD BE CONDUCT DECIDEDLY RISQUE IN A CITY MISS IS OFTEN INNOCENT PLAYFULNESS IN A COUNTRY MAID
IS TAKEN FROM THAT OF THE MELODY TONE THE APPOGGIATURA WAS FORMERLY CLASSIFIED INTO LONG APPOGGIATURA
SHOULD DISCLOSE HIS REAL QUALITY OF GREENGROCER AND SHOW THAT HE IS NOT THE FAMILY BUTLER THE HOSTESS IS SMILING RESOLUTELY THROUGH ALL THE COURSES SMILING THROUGH HER AGONY THOUGH HER HEART IS IN THE KITCHEN AND SHE IS SPECULATING WITH TERROR
A CERTAIN MEASURE OF THE SOPHISTICATED OR UNSOPHISTICATION OF A YOUTHFUL DAMSEL MAY BE FOUND
TO WITHIN A DAY JUST HOW LONG I SHALL LIVE SEC OND LY YOU MUST TELL ME HOW SOON I SHALL RIDE ROUND THE WHOLE WORLD AND LASTLY YOU SHALL TELL ME WHAT I THINK
THAN THEY ARE AT PRESENT IN THIS FREE COUNTRY HOW DOES THIS MOST ANCIENT APOLOGUE APPLY TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND THE DINNER GIVING SNOB THE IMITATION OF THE GREAT IS UNIVERSAL IN THIS CITY FROM THE PALACES OF KENSINGTONIA
O KING THAT CANNOT BE SAID THE SHEPHERD
SILENCE FAW THE CHAIR NOW IF THIS BE THE CASE IF THE BRUMMAGEM PLATE POMP AND THE PROCESSIONS OF DISGUISED FOOTMEN ARE ODIOUS AND FOOLISH IN EVERYDAY LIFE
SHOULD THE FAVORED ONE BE OPENLY CONVICTED THAT ALTERS NOT ONE WHIT HIS STATUE WITH THE GIRL FOR A GIRL HAVING GIVEN HER HEART NEVER RECALLS IT NOT WHOLLY SHE MAY REGRET SHE NEVER RECOILS IN OTHER WORDS
BUT IF THEN YOU FAIL TO ANSWER ME YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR HEAD AND ALL YOUR LANDS SHALL BE MINE THE ABBOT WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND IN GREAT FEAR HE FIRST RODE TO OXFORD HERE WAS A GREAT SCHOOL
WHOM YOU HAVE THE HONOUR OF KNOWING IF SUCH BE NOT THE CASE I AM FAR FROM WISHING THAT THEIR GRACES SHOULD TREAT ME IN A SIMILAR FASHION SPLENDOUR IS A PART OF THEIR STATION AS DECENT COMFORT LET US TRUST OF YOURS AND MINE
AND EASY AND FRIENDLY WERE THEY BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A NATURAL UNPRETENTIOUS WAY AND BUT FOR AN UNHAPPY PASSION FOR PEACOCKS FEATHERS IN ENGLAND GENTLE SHADES OF MARAT AND ROBESPIERRE
CAN THE CRUEL WOLF HAVE EATEN HER UP AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SOB BITTERLY WHEN WHO SHOULD WALK IN BUT GRANNIE HERSELF AS LARGE AS LIFE AND AS HEARTY AS EVER
TO BE WOOED AND WEDDED IS THE LAW OF HER BEING YET NOT FOR ONE MOMENT DARES SHE TO EXHIBIT TOO GREAT AN ALACRITY TO OBEY THAT LAW FOR SHE KNOWS INSTINCTIVELY THAT AN EASY VICTORY PROGNOSTICATES A FICKLE VICTOR
WITH BITTERNESS IN HIS HEART HAVING JUST QUITTED HIS LAUNDRESS WHO IS DUNNING HIM FOR HER BILL IS FIRING OFF GOOD STORIES AND THE OPPOSITION WAG IS FURIOUS THAT HE CANNOT GET AN INNINGS JAWKINS THE GREAT CONVERSATIONALIST
AND YOUR EYES GRANNIE WHAT GREAT YELLOW EYES YOU HAVE
WAITED UPON HIM AT HIS TABLE WHEN KING JOHN HEARD OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE ABBOT LIVED HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO PUT A STOP TO IT SO HE SENT FOR THE OLD MAN TO COME AND SEE HIM HOW NOW MY GOOD ABBOT
AFTER THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT OUTSIDE AND ALL RED RIDING HOOD COULD SEE WAS THAT THE WINDOW CURTAINS AND THE BED CURTAINS WERE STILL DRAWN AND HER GRANDMOTHER SEEMED TO BE LYING IN BED WITH THE BED CLOTHES PULLED ALMOST OVER HER HEAD AND HER GREAT
AGREMENTS ARE ORNAMENTAL TONES EITHER REPRESENTED IN FULL IN THE SCORE OR INDICATED BY CERTAIN SIGNS THE FOLLOWING ARE THE EMBELLISHMENTS MOST COMMONLY FOUND TRILL OR SHAKE MORDENT
MANY GIRLS WOULD LIKE TO BE MEN EXCEPT ON OCCASIONS AT LEAST SO THEY SAY BUT PERHAPS THIS IS JUST A PART OF THEIR SOMETHING OR OTHERISHNESS WHY THEY SHOULD WANT TO BE MEN MEN CANNOT CONCEIVE MEN PALE BEFORE THEM
AND ENTERTAIN EACH OTHER TO THE RUIN OF FRIENDSHIP LET ALONE HEALTH AND THE DESTRUCTION OF HOSPITALITY AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP YOU WHO BUT FOR THE PEACOCK'S TAIL MIGHT CHATTER AWAY SO MUCH AT YOUR EASE AND BE SO JOVIAL AND HAPPY
THESE THINGS BY THEMSELVES DO NOT CONSTITUTE A GIRL WHICH IS OBVIOUS NOR IS ANY ONE GIRL WITHOUT THESE THINGS WHICH IS NOT TOO OBVIOUS WHERE THE THINGS END AND THE GIRL BEGINS MANY MEN HAVE TRIED TO FIND OUT
IF ANY OF THE WISE PRO FESS ORS COULD HELP HIM BUT THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT KING JOHN IN ANY OF THEIR BOOKS THEN THE ABBOT RODE DOWN TO CAM BRIDGE
WITH ITALIAN COLORATURA SINGING
THAT A FOOL MAY TEACH A WISE MAN WIT I THINK I CAN HELP YOU OUT OF YOUR TROUBLE YOU HELP ME CRIED THE ABBOT HOW HOW WELL ANSWERED THE SHEPHERD YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY SAYS
THROUGH THE COPSE AND DOWN THE HOLLOW AND OVER THE BRIDGE AND THREE MEADOWS AFTER THE MILL
WHICH MAKES THEM MORE SOMETHING OR OTHERISH STILL THERE IS NO OTHER WORD FOR IT A GIRL IS A COMPLICATED THING IT IS MADE UP OF CLOTHES SMILES A POMPADOUR THINGS OF WHICH SPACE AND PRUDENCE FORBID THE ENUMERATION HERE
YOUR HEAD SHALL BE CUT OFF AND ALL YOUR RICHES SHALL BE MINE I WILL TRY TO ANSWER THEM O KING SAID THE ABBOT WELL THEN SAID KING JOHN AS I SIT HERE WITH MY CROWN OF GOLD ON MY HEAD YOU MUST TELL ME
FOR WHERE TWO CROSS PATHS DIVIDED THERE SAT A BIG GRAY WOLF LICKING HIS LONG PAWS AND LOOKING SHARPLY ABOUT HIM AND GOOD MORNING RED RIDING HOOD SAID HE GOOD MORNING MISTER WOLF SHE ANSWERED
WHAT A MAN DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT A GIRL WOULD FILL A SARATOGA TRUNK
WHY THEN I DO BELIEVE SHE IS A VERY DEAR OLD FRIEND OF MINE WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO YOU AND I I WILL GO BY THIS WAY AND YOU SHALL TAKE THAT AND WHOEVER GETS THERE FIRST
WHO HAD ONLY ONE CHILD A LITTLE GIRL SHE WAS SO PRETTY AND SO GOOD THAT THE SUN SEEMED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY WHEN ITS LIGHT FELL UPON HER ROSY LITTLE FACE
IN THE CASE OF BOTH MORDENT AND DOUBLE MORDENT
LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
WHERE I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED THE FORMER TO FALL LIMP AT THE END OF A BROKEN NECK IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS THE APE WAS TEARING AWAY THE ENTIRE FRONT OF ITS BREAST WHICH WAS HELD IN THE VISE LIKE GRIP OF THE POWERFUL JAWS
BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
WITH WHICH IT EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO BRAIN ME THE CREATURES WERE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET TALL STANDING ERECT AND HAD LIKE THE GREEN MARTIANS AN INTERMEDIARY SET OF ARMS OR LEGS
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHAINED IN WARHOON IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
WITH ARMS WIDE STRETCHED TO EASE HIS FALL AGAIN AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY I HAD RECOURSE TO EARTHLY TACTICS AND SWINGING MY RIGHT FIST FULL UPON THE POINT OF HIS CHIN
CAN IT BE THAT ALL EARTH MEN ARE AS YOU ALONE A STRANGER HUNTED THREATENED PERSECUTED YOU HAVE DONE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WHAT IN ALL THE PAST AGES OF BARSOOM NO MAN HAS EVER DONE
HIS GREAT EYES FASTENED UPON ME IN WHAT SEEMED A PITIFUL APPEAL FOR PROTECTION I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THAT LOOK NOR COULD I ON SECOND THOUGHT HAVE DESERTED MY RESCUER WITHOUT GIVING AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF IN HIS BEHALF
BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF
MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
BY CUSTOM HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FROM WHERE IT FELL AND PLACING HIS FOOT UPON THE NECK OF HIS ERSTWHILE RULER HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF JEDDAK OF WARHOON
BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM
JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN TWO GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS BATTLE WITH NATURE'S WEAPONS AND THE EXHIBITION OF ANIMAL FEROCITY WHICH ENSUED WAS AS FEARFUL A THING AS THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION COULD PICTURE
WE RODE FORTH AT A FURIOUS PACE IN PURSUIT OF THE COLUMN MY WOUNDS GAVE ME BUT LITTLE PAIN SO WONDERFULLY AND RAPIDLY HAD THE APPLICATIONS AND INJECTIONS OF THE FEMALE EXERCISED THEIR THERAPEUTIC POWERS
I WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW AND I KNEW THAT ONCE IN THE STREET I MIGHT GAIN THE PLAZA AND SAFETY BEFORE THE CREATURE COULD OVERTAKE ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
I BEHELD TARS TARKAS SOLA AND THREE OR FOUR WARRIORS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE CHAMBER AS MY EYES MET THEIRS I WAS FOR THE SECOND TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THEIR ZEALOUSLY GUARDED APPLAUSE
AND TURNED TO FOLLOW US FROM THE ROOM THERE SEEMED SOMETHING MENACING IN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD MY BEAST AND I HESITATED TO LEAVE UNTIL I HAD LEARNED THE OUTCOME IT WAS WELL I DID SO FOR THE WARRIOR DREW AN
RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
BUT SO ALSO WAS THE APE WHOSE STRUGGLES WERE GROWING MOMENTARILY LESS SUDDENLY I CAME TO MYSELF
THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
WHILE IT JABBERED AND GESTICULATED AT SOME ANSWERING CREATURE BEHIND ME THIS OTHER WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY ITS MATE SOON CAME TOWARD US BEARING A MIGHTY STONE CUDGEL
WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
WHEN A BOLT OF MYRIAD LEGGED HORROR HURLED ITSELF THROUGH THE DOORWAY FULL UPON THE BREAST OF MY EXECUTIONER WITH A SHRIEK OF FEAR THE APE WHICH HELD ME LEAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW BUT ITS MATE CLOSED IN A TERRIFIC
NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
HELD IN ITS POOR UGLY CARCASS MORE LOVE MORE LOYALTY MORE GRATITUDE
FOR IT WAS SAB THAN PRINCE OF ZODANGA WHO STOOD REVEALED BEFORE ME THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS AND PLACED ONE OF THE COLLARS OF GOLD ABOUT HIS SON'S NECK
IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
I WAITED HIS COMING CROUCHING LIKE SOME BEAST OF PREY AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE MY FOOD UPON THE GROUND I SWUNG THE CHAIN ABOVE MY HEAD AND CRASHED THE LINKS WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON HIS SKULL WITHOUT A SOUND
BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
FOOD WAS BROUGHT ME AT INTERVALS BUT OWING TO THE UTTER DARKNESS OF THE PLACE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I LAY THERE DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MY LIFE
AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
BACK AND FORTH UPON THE FLOOR THEY ROLLED NEITHER ONE EMITTING A SOUND OF FEAR OR PAIN PRESENTLY I SAW THE GREAT EYES OF MY BEAST BULGING COMPLETELY FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND BLOOD FLOWING FROM ITS NOSTRILS
BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
STRENGTH AND COURAGE SOLA WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED THE SEARCHING PARTY OF HER OWN VOLITION WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MARTIANS WHOSE FACE HAD NOT BEEN TWISTED IN LAUGHTER AS I BATTLED FOR MY LIFE SHE ON THE CONTRARY
TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
THIS ENCOUNTER TOGETHER WITH MY SET TO WITH THE MARTIAN WARRIOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND MY FEATS OF JUMPING PLACED ME UPON A HIGH PINNACLE IN THEIR REGARD EVIDENTLY DEVOID OF ALL THE FINER SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP
AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
WAS SOBER WITH APPARENT SOLICITUDE AND AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE MONSTER RUSHED TO ME AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED MY BODY FOR POSSIBLE WOUNDS OR INJURIES SATISFYING HERSELF THAT I HAD COME OFF UNSCATHED SHE SMILED QUIETLY
I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
AND STEALTHILY ON CAME THE AWFUL EYES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DEAD BODY AT MY FEET THEN SLOWLY THEY RETREATED BUT THIS TIME WITH A STRANGE GRATING SOUND
RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
AND SOLA GRASPING ME TIGHTLY BY THE ARM I HAD AT LEAST TWO FRIENDS ON MARS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WATCHED OVER ME WITH MOTHERLY SOLICITUDE AND A DUMB BRUTE WHICH AS I LATER CAME TO KNOW
DEATH STRUGGLE WITH MY PRESERVER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MY FAITHFUL WATCH THING I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL SO HIDEOUS A CREATURE A DOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GAINED MY FEET AND BACKING AGAINST THE WALL I WITNESSED SUCH A
FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED
I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
BATTLE AS IT IS VOUCHSAFED FEW BEINGS TO SEE THE STRENGTH AGILITY AND BLIND FEROCITY OF THESE TWO CREATURES IS APPROACHED BY NOTHING KNOWN TO EARTHLY MAN
THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
SCARCELY HAD THE BLOW DESCENDED WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A NEW DANGER THE APE'S MATE RECOVERED FROM ITS FIRST SHOCK OF TERROR HAD RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE ENCOUNTER BY WAY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING
AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS THE THING WHICH MORE NEARLY RESEMBLED OUR EARTHLY MEN THAN IT DID THE MARTIANS I HAD SEEN HELD ME PINIONED TO THE GROUND WITH ONE HUGE FOOT
FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
MY BEAST HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS FIRST HOLD HAVING SUNK HIS MIGHTY FANGS FAR INTO THE BREAST OF HIS ADVERSARY BUT THE GREAT ARMS AND PAWS OF THE APE
AGAINST ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH SHOULD I REMAIN AND FIGHT HOWEVER DESPERATELY IT IS TRUE I HELD THE CUDGEL BUT WHAT COULD I DO WITH IT AGAINST HIS FOUR GREAT ARMS
WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
RATHER THAN BY A WATER HEARTED WEAKLING FROM WHOM EVEN OLD DAK KOVA COULD TEAR THE METAL WITH HIS BARE HANDS BAR COMAS EYED THE DEFIANT AND INSUBORDINATE CHIEFTAIN FOR AN INSTANT HIS EXPRESSION ONE OF HAUGHTY
AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
BACKED BY MUSCLES FAR TRANSCENDING THOSE OF THE MARTIAN MEN I HAD SEEN HAD LOCKED THE THROAT OF MY GUARDIAN AND SLOWLY WERE CHOKING OUT HIS LIFE AND BENDING BACK HIS HEAD AND NECK UPON HIS BODY
AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS THEIR EYES WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND NON PROTRUDING THEIR EARS WERE HIGH SET BUT MORE LATERALLY LOCATED THAN THOSE OF THE MARTIANS
AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
AS HE HAD IN MINE WITHOUT MORE ADO THEREFORE I TURNED TO MEET THE CHARGE OF THE INFURIATED BULL APE HE WAS NOW TOO CLOSE UPON ME FOR THE CUDGEL TO PROVE OF ANY EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE
CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
WHO PROVED TO BE THE JEDDAK OF THE HORDES OF WARHOON LIKE THE JED WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY SCARRED AND ALSO DECORATED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF HUMAN SKULLS AND DRIED DEAD HANDS
THE INJURIES TO DAK KOVA HAD DELAYED THE MARCH SO GREATLY THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHICH WAS A RAID UPON A SMALL THARK COMMUNITY IN RETALIATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INCUBATOR UNTIL AFTER THE GREAT GAMES
BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA
AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS I TOOK A DOZEN WARRIORS AND HASTENED TO THE DUNGEONS BENEATH THE PALACE THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION
ALTHOUGH I AT FIRST BOMBARDED HIM WITH QUESTIONS FINALLY ALL THE HATRED AND MANIACAL LOATHING FOR THESE AWFUL CREATURES WHO HAD PLACED ME IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WAS CENTERED BY MY TOTTERING REASON UPON THIS SINGLE EMISSARY
HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
I SEIZED THE CUDGEL WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BATTLE AND SWINGING IT WITH ALL THE POWER OF MY EARTHLY ARMS I CRASHED IT FULL UPON THE HEAD OF THE APE CRUSHING HIS SKULL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN EGGSHELL
MISTER WICKHAM HAD RECEIVED HIS COMMISSION BEFORE HE LEFT LONDON AND HE WAS TO JOIN HIS REGIMENT AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT NO ONE BUT MISSUS BENNET REGRETTED THAT THEIR STAY WOULD BE SO SHORT AND SHE MADE THE MOST OF THE TIME BY VISITING ABOUT WITH HER DAUGHTER AND HAVING VERY FREQUENT PARTIES AT HOME
AND HER HUSBAND'S LOVE OF INDEPENDENCE HAD ALONE PREVENTED THEIR EXCEEDING THEIR INCOME FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WAS SETTLED BY MARRIAGE ARTICLES ON MISSUS BENNET AND THE CHILDREN BUT IN WHAT PROPORTIONS IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED AMONGST THE LATTER DEPENDED ON THE WILL OF THE PARENTS
HE WAS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT A CAUSE OF SO LITTLE ADVANTAGE TO ANYONE SHOULD BE FORWARDED AT THE SOLE EXPENSE OF HIS BROTHER IN LAW
AND MISSUS BENNET FOR MANY YEARS AFTER LYDIA'S BIRTH HAD BEEN CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD THIS EVENT HAD AT LAST BEEN DESPAIRED OF BUT IT WAS THEN TOO LATE TO BE SAVING MISSUS BENNET HAD NO TURN FOR ECONOMY
HE CONFIDED TO MIKE HIS INTENTION OF LEAVING THE BANK AS SOON AS HE HAD MADE A NAME AND TAKING SERIOUSLY TO THE BUSINESS HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD KNOCKED THEM AT THE BEDFORD THE WEEK BEFORE AND IN SUPPORT OF THE STATEMENT SHOWED HIM A CUTTING FROM THE ERA IN WHICH THE WRITER SAID THAT
I PROMISED THEM SO FAITHFULLY WHAT WILL WICKHAM SAY IT WAS TO BE SUCH A SECRET IF IT WAS TO BE SECRET SAID JANE SAY NOT ANOTHER WORD ON THE SUBJECT YOU MAY DEPEND UPON MY SEEKING NO FURTHER OH CERTAINLY SAID ELIZABETH
ALL HE COULD UNDERSTAND WAS THAT A FAR WORSE THING HAD HAPPENED THAN ANYTHING HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED A FORGERY HE SAID A FORGERY AND A CLUMSY ONE
THEY MUST ALL GO TO BRIGHTON THAT IS THE PLACE TO GET HUSBANDS WHAT A PITY IT IS MAMMA WE DID NOT ALL GO VERY TRUE AND IF I HAD MY WILL WE SHOULD BUT MY DEAR LYDIA I DON'T AT ALL LIKE YOUR GOING SUCH A WAY OFF MUST IT BE SO
SIR JOHN MORRISON'S SIGNATURE YES IT CAME IN THE MORNING RATHER LATE MIKE REMEMBERED THE CHEQUE PERFECTLY WELL OWING TO THE AMOUNT IT WAS THE ONLY THREE FIGURE CHEQUE WHICH HAD COME ACROSS THE COUNTER DURING THE DAY
HOW DO THESE IDEAS GET ABOUT I YIELD TO NOBODY IN MY RESPECT FOR OUR MANAGER I MAY HAVE HAD OCCASION FROM TIME TO TIME TO CORRECT HIM IN SOME TRIFLING MATTER
HIS LETTER WAS SOON DISPATCHED FOR THOUGH DILATORY IN UNDERTAKING BUSINESS
WHERE HE FOUND THE OLD ETONIAN EYEING WITH DISFAVOUR A NEW SATIN TIE WHICH BRISTOW WAS WEARING THAT MORNING FOR THE FIRST TIME
I SHALL LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS
AND CENTRED AND SANDY TURNBULL HEADED A BEAUTIFUL GOAL
SMILING THE CASHIER DID NOT NOTICE THE MOVEMENT SOMEBODY HAD COME IN TO CASH A CHEQUE AND HE WAS WORKING MECHANICALLY
WHEN THE FIRST TRANSPORTS OF RAGE WHICH HAD PRODUCED HIS ACTIVITY IN SEEKING HER WERE OVER
WE ALL HAVE OUR HOBBIES SAID PSMITH JACKSON WASN'T SAYING MUCH HE JOLLY WELL HADN'T A CHANCE OLD BICK WAS SHOOTING IT OUT FOURTEEN TO THE DOZEN I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED SAID PSMITH TO HEAR COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPEAK BOTH IN HIS SANCTUM AND IN PUBLIC
THE LITTLE THEATRE WAS OPEN WELL AND SO JUST AS THE CARRIAGE CAME TO THE DOOR MY
MY TIME FROM NOW ONWARD IS HIS HE SHALL HAVE THE FULL EDUCATIVE VALUE OF MY EXCLUSIVE ATTENTION I GIVE COMRADE BRISTOW UP MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE CORNER FLAG YOU UNDERSTAND HE ADDED AS MISTER ROSSITER EMERGED FROM HIS LAIR
THE PRINCIPAL PURPORT OF HIS LETTER WAS TO INFORM THEM THAT MISTER WICKHAM HAD RESOLVED ON QUITTING THE MILITIA IT WAS GREATLY MY WISH THAT HE SHOULD DO SO HE ADDED AS SOON AS HIS MARRIAGE WAS FIXED ON
YOU BEGIN IN A SMALL WAY BY BREAKING SCHOOL RULES TO EXTRACT COMRADE JELLICOE PERHAPS THE SUPREMEST OF ALL THE BLITHERERS I HAVE EVER MET FROM A HOLE IF YOU HAD STOPPED THERE ALL MIGHT HAVE BEEN WELL BUT THE THING ONCE STARTED FASCINATED YOU
LOOK HERE SMITH HE SAID I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU I'M IN A BIT OF A HOLE
HE RECOLLECTED THE MAN WHO HAD PRESENTED IT A TALLISH MAN WITH A BEARD
THERE WAS A CURIOUSLY GREY TIRED LOOK ON HIS FACE MIKE COULD NOT MAKE IT OUT
BUT ALL IS NOT YET LOST YOU MUST RECOLLECT THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPOKE IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT THAT GENEROUS TEMPERAMENT WAS STIRRED TO ITS DEPTHS HE DID NOT PICK HIS WORDS BUT CALM WILL SUCCEED STORM AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING YET
IT IS WHEN THE DAYS ARE LONG AND THE SUN BEATS HOT ON THE PAVEMENT AND EVERYTHING SHOUTS TO HIM HOW SPLENDID IT IS OUT IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE BEGINS TO GROW RESTLESS
EDWARD IT APPEARED HAD RALLIED IN THE AFTERNOON
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT THEY WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS AT HOME UP TILL NOW THE MATTER HAD SEEMED ENTIRELY A PERSONAL ONE
HE THEN DELIVERED ON PAPER HIS PERFECT APPROBATION OF ALL THAT WAS DONE
BUT IF I FIND AS I SUSPECT THAT HE HAS WRONGED COMRADE JACKSON I SHALL BE FORCED TO SPEAK SHARPLY TO HIM MIKE HAD LEFT THE SCENE OF BATTLE BY THE TIME PSMITH REACHED THE CASH DEPARTMENT
MY UNCLE AND AUNT AND I WERE TO GO TOGETHER AND THE OTHERS WERE TO MEET US AT THE CHURCH WELL MONDAY MORNING CAME AND I WAS IN SUCH A FUSS I WAS SO AFRAID YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO PUT IT OFF
NEUROTIC I CANNOT HAVE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JOLTED AND DISORGANIZED IN THIS MANNER AND HIS VALUE AS A CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARY AND ADVISER IMPAIRED EVEN THOUGH IT BE ONLY TEMPORARILY I MUST LOOK INTO THIS I WILL GO AND SEE IF THE ORGY IS CONCLUDED
YOU MUST DROP IT COMRADE JACKSON WHEN YOU WERE FREE AND WITHOUT TIES IT DID NOT SO MUCH MATTER
AND WENT IN THE MANAGER WAS IN HIS CHAIR AT THE BIG TABLE OPPOSITE HIM
BUT HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT ROUND WHICH IT REVOLVED
THE HEAD OF THE CASH DEPARTMENT WAS AS A RULE MILDLY CHEERFUL ON ARRIVAL AND APT EXCESSIVELY MIKE THOUGHT THOUGH HE ALWAYS LISTENED WITH POLITE INTEREST TO RELATE THE MOST RECENT SAYINGS AND DOINGS OF HIS SNUB NOSED SON EDWARD
THIS WAS ONE POINT WITH REGARD TO LYDIA AT LEAST WHICH WAS NOW TO BE SETTLED AND MISTER BENNET COULD HAVE NO HESITATION IN ACCEDING TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE HIM IN TERMS OF GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR THE KINDNESS OF HIS BROTHER THOUGH EXPRESSED MOST CONCISELY
SHE BEGAN NOW TO COMPREHEND THAT HE WAS EXACTLY THE MAN WHO IN DISPOSITION AND TALENTS WOULD MOST SUIT HER HIS UNDERSTANDING AND TEMPER THOUGH UNLIKE HER OWN WOULD HAVE ANSWERED ALL HER WISHES
LYDIA NEED NOT HAVE BEEN INDEBTED TO HER UNCLE FOR WHATEVER OF HONOUR OR CREDIT COULD NOW BE PURCHASED FOR HER THE SATISFACTION OF PREVAILING ON ONE OF THE MOST WORTHLESS YOUNG MEN IN GREAT BRITAIN TO BE HER HUSBAND MIGHT THEN HAVE RESTED IN ITS PROPER PLACE
PSMITH MAKES INQUIRIES PSMITH AS WAS HIS HABIT OF A MORNING WHEN THE FIERCE RUSH OF HIS COMMERCIAL DUTIES HAD ABATED SOMEWHAT WAS LEANING GRACEFULLY AGAINST HIS DESK
COULD HE KNOW THAT THE PROPOSALS WHICH SHE HAD PROUDLY SPURNED ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN MOST GLADLY AND GRATEFULLY RECEIVED HE WAS AS GENEROUS SHE DOUBTED NOT AS THE MOST GENEROUS OF HIS SEX BUT WHILE HE WAS MORTAL THERE MUST BE A TRIUMPH
AND THE CASHIER PUTTING ON HIS COAT AND HAT PASSED SILENTLY OUT THROUGH THE SWING DOORS HE WALKED LISTLESSLY HE WAS EVIDENTLY TIRED OUT MIKE SHUT HIS LEDGER WITH A VICIOUS BANG AND WENT ACROSS TO FIND PSMITH HE WAS GLAD THE DAY WAS OVER
LOOK HERE SMITH SAID MIKE EARNESTLY FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T GO PLAYING THE GOAT THERE'S NO EARTHLY NEED FOR YOU TO GET LUGGED INTO THIS BUSINESS DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME I SHALL BE ALL RIGHT I THINK SAID PSMITH THAT YOU WILL
INTO ONE HOUSE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THEY SHALL NEVER HAVE ADMITTANCE I WILL NOT ENCOURAGE THE IMPUDENCE OF EITHER BY RECEIVING THEM AT LONGBOURN A LONG DISPUTE FOLLOWED THIS DECLARATION BUT MISTER BENNET WAS FIRM IT SOON LED TO ANOTHER
THEIR SISTER'S WEDDING DAY ARRIVED AND JANE AND ELIZABETH FELT FOR HER PROBABLY MORE THAN SHE FELT FOR HERSELF THE CARRIAGE WAS SENT TO MEET THEM AT AND THEY WERE TO RETURN IN IT BY DINNER TIME THEIR ARRIVAL WAS DREADED BY THE ELDER MISS BENNETS AND JANE MORE ESPECIALLY
IS REASSURING I MAY NOW THINK OF MY OWN TROUBLES COMRADE BRISTOW HAS BLOWN INTO THE OFFICE TODAY IN PATENT LEATHER BOOTS WITH WHITE KID UPPERS AS I BELIEVE THE TECHNICAL TERM IS ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT HE IS STILL WEARING THE SATIN TIE THE WAISTCOAT AND THE RING
HAGGERSTON HAS OUR DIRECTIONS AND ALL WILL BE COMPLETED IN A WEEK THEY WILL THEN JOIN HIS REGIMENT UNLESS THEY ARE FIRST INVITED TO LONGBOURN AND I UNDERSTAND FROM MISSUS GARDINER THAT MY NIECE IS VERY DESIROUS OF SEEING YOU ALL BEFORE SHE LEAVES THE SOUTH
I SUCCEEDED YESTERDAY IN INDUCING THE MAN BRISTOW TO ABANDON THAT RAINBOW WAISTCOAT OF HIS TODAY I ENTER THE BUILDING BLYTHE AND BUOYANT WORN OF COURSE FROM THE LONG STRUGGLE BUT SEEING WITH ACHING EYES THE DAWN OF ANOTHER BETTER ERA
NO I PREFER TO THINK THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE REGARDS ME AS HIS FRIEND AND WELL WISHER AND WILL LEND A COURTEOUS EAR TO ANY PROPOSAL I SEE FIT TO MAKE I HOPE SHORTLY TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THIS TO YOU
AND MY DEAR AUNT IF YOU DO NOT TELL ME IN AN HONOURABLE MANNER I SHALL CERTAINLY BE REDUCED TO TRICKS AND STRATAGEMS TO FIND IT OUT JANE'S DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO SPEAK TO ELIZABETH PRIVATELY OF WHAT LYDIA HAD LET FALL ELIZABETH WAS GLAD OF IT
HE MURMURED MUSINGLY I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT COMRADE WALLER'S MISFORTUNES CANNOT BUT BE TRIVIAL COMPARED WITH MINE BUT POSSIBLY IT WILL BE AS WELL TO ASCERTAIN THEIR NATURE I WILL REEL ROUND AND MAKE INQUIRIES GOOD MAN SAID MIKE
I THINK THERE CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE SAID ON THE SUBJECT LA
MISTER WALLER STILL CHIRPY HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD NEWS OF EDWARD MIKE WENT FOR HIS MORNING STROLL ROUND THE OFFICE FEELING THAT THINGS HAD SETTLED DOWN AND HAD MADE UP THEIR MIND TO RUN SMOOTHLY WHEN HE GOT BACK BARELY HALF AN HOUR LATER THE STORM HAD BURST
GAVE HER HAND WITH AN AFFECTIONATE SMILE TO WICKHAM WHO FOLLOWED HIS LADY AND WISHED THEM BOTH JOY WITH AN ALACRITY WHICH SHEWED NO DOUBT OF THEIR HAPPINESS THEIR RECEPTION FROM MISTER BENNET TO WHOM THEY THEN TURNED WAS NOT QUITE SO CORDIAL HIS COUNTENANCE RATHER GAINED IN AUSTERITY
AND THERE WAS MY AUNT
YET THERE IT IS ONCE MORE MIKE WAS TONGUE TIED FOR THE LIFE OF HIM HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG MEN TOO THAT SHE LIKES VERY MUCH THE OFFICERS MAY NOT BE SO PLEASANT IN GENERAL REGIMENT HIS DAUGHTER'S REQUEST FOR SUCH IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED OF BEING ADMITTED INTO HER FAMILY AGAIN BEFORE SHE SET OFF FOR THE NORTH
HIS LIFE WAS VERY REGULAR
MIKE FOUND HIMSELF BY DEGREES GROWING QUITE ATTACHED TO THE NEW ASIATIC BANK ONE MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY
NOT HOWEVER FROM ANY FEAR OF DISADVANTAGE FROM IT INDIVIDUALLY TO HERSELF FOR AT ANY RATE THERE SEEMED A GULF IMPASSABLE BETWEEN THEM
WHAT WITH HER BOARD AND POCKET ALLOWANCE AND THE CONTINUAL PRESENTS IN MONEY WHICH PASSED TO HER THROUGH HER MOTHER'S HANDS LYDIA'S EXPENSES HAD BEEN VERY LITTLE WITHIN THAT SUM
HE HAD THUNDERED AT MIKE AS IF MIKE HAD BEEN HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT OR THE ENCROACHING ALIEN OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND THAT KIND OF THING IS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING AT SHORT RANGE MIKE'S HEAD WAS STILL SPINNING IT CONTINUED TO SPIN
THE WHOLE PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TO LIFT HE SAW A WAY OUT IT WAS A CURIOUS CROOKED WAY BUT AT THAT MOMENT IT STRETCHED CLEAR AND BROAD BEFORE HIM HE FELT LIGHTHEARTED AND EXCITED AS IF HE WERE WATCHING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME INTERESTING PLAY AT THE THEATRE HE GOT UP
BUT TO LIVE IN IGNORANCE ON SUCH A POINT WAS IMPOSSIBLE OR AT LEAST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TRY FOR INFORMATION
OR RATHER BEING APPARENTLY CERTAIN TO END SATISFACTORILY FOR THE INVALID THOUGH OUT OF DANGER WAS STILL IN BED
AS SOON AS HE SHOULD BE OF AGE AND THE WIDOW AND YOUNGER CHILDREN WOULD BY THAT MEANS BE PROVIDED FOR
IT EMBRACES A HUNDRED DEGREES OF MEANING MIKE HAD EXPECTED SENTENCE OF DISMISSAL AND HE HAD GOT IT SO FAR HE HAD NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TURMOIL I COULDN'T WAIT TO HEAR I WAS TOO JOLLY GLAD TO GET AWAY OLD BICK LOOKED AT ME AS IF HE COULD EAT ME
WHICH I JOLLY WELL DID HE HAD STARTED JAWING JACKSON AGAIN BEFORE I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE APPLAUDING HIS HUSTLE SAID PSMITH I FEAR THAT I MUST TAKE OFFICIAL NOTICE OF THIS COMRADE JACKSON IS ESSENTIALLY A SENSITIVE PLANT HIGHLY STRUNG
HE'S GOT THE HUMP ABOUT SOMETHING HE'S SITTING THERE LOOKING ABSOLUTELY FED UP WITH THINGS I HOPE THERE'S NOTHING UP HE'S NOT A BAD SORT IT WOULD BE ROT IF ANYTHING ROTTEN'S HAPPENED PSMITH BEGAN TO DISPLAY A GENTLE INTEREST
HE GREETED CUSTOMERS WITH BRIGHT REMARKS ON THE WEATHER AND SNAPPY VIEWS ON THE LEADING EVENTS OF THE DAY THE FORMER TINGED WITH OPTIMISM THE LATTER FULL OF A GENTLE SPIRIT OF TOLERATION
THAT WAS AT TEN O'CLOCK FROM TEN TO ELEVEN HE WOULD POTTER THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON AT THAT TIME IN HIS DEPARTMENT
APPLIES FOR A RISE OF SALARY NOW POSSIBLY IN YOUR CASE IN MY CASE INTERRUPTED MIKE THERE WAS NONE OF THAT ROT BICKERSDYKE WASN'T PUTTING IT ON HE MEANT EVERY WORD
FOR WHICH I HAVE PLEDGED MYSELF AND WILL YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF CARRYING SIMILAR ASSURANCES TO HIS CREDITORS IN MERYTON OF WHOM I SHALL SUBJOIN A LIST ACCORDING TO HIS INFORMATION HE HAS GIVEN IN ALL HIS DEBTS I HOPE AT LEAST HE HAS NOT DECEIVED US
BUT NO SUCH HAPPY MARRIAGE COULD NOW TEACH THE ADMIRING MULTITUDE WHAT CONNUBIAL FELICITY REALLY WAS
BOTH ON HIS ACCOUNT AND MY NIECE'S IT IS MISTER WICKHAM'S INTENTION TO GO INTO THE REGULARS AND AMONG HIS FORMER FRIENDS THERE ARE STILL SOME WHO ARE ABLE AND WILLING TO ASSIST HIM IN THE ARMY HE HAS THE PROMISE OF AN ENSIGNCY IN GENERAL REGIMENT
THE THING MUST STOP YOUR SECRETARIAL DUTIES MUST BE PARAMOUNT NOTHING MUST BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH THEM YES THE THING MUST STOP BEFORE IT GOES TOO FAR IT SEEMS TO ME SAID MIKE THAT IT HAS GONE TOO FAR I'VE GOT THE SACK
AND TO REALIZE THAT HIS BLUNT SPEECH WAS LARGELY DUE TO SHYNESS IN SPITE OF HIS PREJUDICE AGAINST EDWARD
THE HAPPY THOUGHT STRUCK HIM OF CONSULTING PSMITH IT WAS HIS HOUR FOR POTTERING
HE IS FURIOUS MISTER BICKERSDYKE TOO THEY ARE BOTH FURIOUS I SHALL BE DISMISSED I SHALL LOSE MY PLACE I SHALL BE DISMISSED HE WAS TALKING MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO MIKE IT WAS DREADFUL TO SEE HIM SITTING THERE ALL LIMP AND BROKEN
EXCEEDED ALL SHE COULD BELIEVE POSSIBLE
HAD NOT HAD TO STAND THE TEST OF SUNSHINE AT PRESENT THE WEATHER BEING COLD AND DISMAL HE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONTENTED NOW THAT HE HAD GOT INTO THE SWING OF HIS WORK THE DAYS PASSED VERY QUICKLY AND WITH HIS LIFE AFTER OFFICE HOURS HE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND AT ALL
WHY HE SAID IT WAS A FORGERY MUTTERED MISTER WALLER SITTING DOWN HEAVILY MIKE COULD NOT TAKE IT IN ALL AT ONCE HE WAS STUNNED
THAN TO ANY SENSE OF SHAME AT HER ELOPING AND LIVING WITH WICKHAM A FORTNIGHT BEFORE THEY TOOK PLACE
CONCERNING A CHEQUE THINGS NEVER HAPPEN QUITE AS ONE EXPECTS THEM TO MIKE CAME TO THE OFFICE NEXT MORNING PREPARED FOR A REPETITION OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HE WAS AMAZED TO FIND THE CASHIER NOT MERELY CHEERFUL BUT EVEN EXUBERANTLY CHEERFUL
HE BEGGED TO KNOW FURTHER PARTICULARS OF WHAT HE WAS INDEBTED TO HIS BROTHER BUT WAS TOO ANGRY WITH LYDIA TO SEND ANY MESSAGE TO HER THE GOOD NEWS SPREAD QUICKLY THROUGH THE HOUSE AND WITH PROPORTIONATE SPEED THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS BORNE IN THE LATTER WITH DECENT PHILOSOPHY
THE MARRIAGE OF A DAUGHTER WHICH HAD BEEN THE FIRST OBJECT OF HER WISHES SINCE JANE WAS SIXTEEN WAS NOW ON THE POINT OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND HER THOUGHTS AND HER WORDS RAN WHOLLY ON THOSE ATTENDANTS OF ELEGANT NUPTIALS FINE MUSLINS NEW CARRIAGES AND SERVANTS
THE PLACE WAS FULL OF QUAINT CHARACTERS THERE WAS WEST WHO HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO LEAVE HAILEYBURY OWING TO HIS HABIT OF BORROWING HORSES AND ATTENDING MEETS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
WHO HAD GENERALLY SOME FRESH GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE RING WEARING BRISTOW TO AIR FROM ELEVEN TO HALF PAST TWELVE HE WOULD PUT IN A LITTLE GENTLE WORK LUNCH
BLOOMING HURRICANE MORE LIKE IT I WAS IN BICK'S ROOM JUST NOW WITH A LETTER TO SIGN AND I TELL YOU THE FUR WAS FLYING ALL OVER THE BALLY SHOP
SHE REPENTED THOUGH SHE HARDLY KNEW OF WHAT SHE BECAME JEALOUS OF HIS ESTEEM WHEN SHE COULD NO LONGER HOPE TO BE BENEFITED BY IT SHE WANTED TO HEAR OF HIM WHEN THERE SEEMED THE LEAST CHANCE OF GAINING INTELLIGENCE
THOUGH I WAS THERE A FORTNIGHT NOT ONE PARTY OR SCHEME OR ANYTHING
MISTER WALLER'S FACE HAD THE UNREASONABLE EFFECT ON HIM OF MAKING HIM FEEL SHY AND AWKWARD
HE NEVER WISHED TO HEAR THE NAME AGAIN WE DO NOT CLAIM ORIGINALITY FOR THE STATEMENT THAT THINGS NEVER HAPPEN QUITE AS ONE EXPECTS THEM TO WE REPEAT IT NOW BECAUSE OF ITS PROFOUND TRUTH THE EDWARD'S PNEUMONIA EPISODE HAVING ENDED SATISFACTORILY
AND MISSUS BENNET FOUND WITH AMAZEMENT AND HORROR THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD NOT ADVANCE A GUINEA TO BUY CLOTHES FOR HIS DAUGHTER HE PROTESTED THAT SHE SHOULD RECEIVE FROM HIM NO MARK OF AFFECTION WHATEVER ON THE OCCASION MISSUS BENNET COULD HARDLY COMPREHEND IT
AGAIN WHAT COULD HE DO BY WAY OF EARNING A LIVING HE DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE CITY AND ITS WAYS BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUMMARY DISMISSAL FROM A BANK IS NOT THE BEST RECOMMENDATION ONE CAN PUT FORWARD IN APPLYING FOR ANOTHER JOB
HE DIDN'T CASH IT AT ALL I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU MISTER JACKSON I WAS AT THE COUNTER WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT IN SAID MIKE I CASHED IT
BUT MY ABSENCE WILL NOT SPELL IRRETRIEVABLE RUIN AS IT WOULD AT A PERIOD OF GREATER COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY COMRADES ROSSITER AND BRISTOW HAVE STUDIED MY METHODS THEY KNOW HOW I LIKE THINGS TO BE DONE THEY ARE FULLY COMPETENT TO CONDUCT THE BUSINESS OF THE DEPARTMENT IN MY ABSENCE
JACKSON HE SAID MIKE CAME FORWARD DO YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE SLOWLY AND WITH AN EFFORT
FOR THESE HE WAS PREPARED WHAT HE DID NOT EXPECT WAS ANY BIG CALAMITY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF IT THE SKY WAS BLUE AND FREE FROM ALL SUGGESTIONS OF APPROACHING THUNDERBOLTS
BUT HE COULD FIND NOTHING THAT WOULD NOT SOUND HORRIBLY STILTED AND COLD HE SAT SILENT SIR JOHN IS IN THERE
FOR MY UNCLE WAS TO GIVE ME AWAY AND IF WE WERE BEYOND THE HOUR WE COULD NOT BE MARRIED ALL DAY BUT LUCKILY HE CAME BACK AGAIN IN TEN MINUTES TIME AND THEN WE ALL SET OUT
LOST BUT A LITTLE OF THEIR SPIRIT IN THIS CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE WITH SUCH AN HUSBAND HER MISERY WAS CONSIDERED CERTAIN
OH IT'S HARD I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT ON ANY OTHER DAY BUT THAT I COULD NOT HAVE MISSED IT THEY SHOWED ME THE CHEQUE IN THERE JUST NOW I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I HAD PASSED IT I DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT MY MIND WAS FAR AWAY I DON'T REMEMBER THE CHEQUE OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT
WHO BELIEVED THAT THE EARTH WAS FLAT AND ADDRESSED MEETINGS ON THE SUBJECT IN HYDE PARK ON SUNDAYS AND MANY OTHERS
HE WENT ABOUT HIS DUTIES IN A COSTUME WHICH SUGGESTED THE SPORTSMAN OF THE COMIC PAPERS THERE WAS ALSO HIGNETT WHO ADDED TO THE MEAGRE SALARY ALLOWED HIM BY THE BANK BY SINGING COMIC SONGS AT THE MINOR MUSIC HALLS
NO ACTION OF THIS YOUNG PRODIGY WAS WITHHELD FROM MIKE HE HAD HEARD ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS
I HAVE WRITTEN TO COLONEL FORSTER TO INFORM HIM OF OUR PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS AND TO REQUEST THAT HE WILL SATISFY THE VARIOUS CREDITORS OF MISTER WICKHAM IN AND NEAR BRIGHTON
AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE DEFINITELY DECIDED THIS MORNING TO ABANDON ALL HOPE OF HIS REFORM
THAT INSTEAD OF SPENDING HIS WHOLE INCOME HE HAD LAID BY AN ANNUAL SUM FOR THE BETTER PROVISION OF HIS CHILDREN AND OF HIS WIFE IF SHE SURVIVED HIM HE NOW WISHED IT MORE THAN EVER HAD HE DONE HIS DUTY IN THAT RESPECT
NOW HAPPILY RECONCILED TO ADA WITH AN INGENIOUS VERBAL CATCH
COMRADE B HAD TO LAY IT ON REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE IN AMERICA AS POSSIBLY YOU ARE AWARE THERE IS A REGULAR POST OF MISTAKE CLERK WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO RECEIVE IN THE NECK ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO BE COMING ALONG WHEN CUSTOMERS MAKE COMPLAINTS HE IS HAULED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE FOAMING CUSTOMER
SHE HAD NO FEAR OF ITS SPREADING FARTHER THROUGH HIS MEANS
COULD BE SPUN OUT FROM HALF PAST TWELVE TO TWO MORE WORK FROM TWO TILL HALF PAST THREE FROM HALF PAST THREE TILL HALF PAST FOUR TEA IN THE TEAROOM WITH A NOVEL
EITHER A LITTLE MORE WORK OR MORE POTTERING ACCORDING TO WHETHER THERE WAS ANY WORK TO DO OR NOT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN UNPLEASANT MODE OF SPENDING A LATE JANUARY DAY THEN THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS AN INTERESTING LITTLE COMMUNITY THAT OF THE NEW ASIATIC BANK
SHE IS WELL AND BEGS TO BE DUTIFULLY REMEMBERED TO YOU AND YOUR MOTHER YOURS ET CETERA E GARDINER MISTER BENNET AND HIS DAUGHTERS SAW ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF WICKHAM'S REMOVAL FROM THE SHIRE
TELL ME ALL HE LISTENED GRAVELY WHILE MIKE RELATED THE INCIDENTS WHICH HAD LED UP TO HIS CONFESSION AND THE RESULTS OF THE SAME AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE NARRATIVE HE SIPPED HIS COFFEE IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT
PSMITH ROSE MIKE LED THE WAY TO A QUIET CORNER OF THE TELEGRAMS DEPARTMENT I TELL YOU COMRADE JACKSON SAID PSMITH I AM HARD PRESSED THE FIGHT IS BEGINNING TO BE TOO MUCH FOR ME
WE SHALL BE AT NEWCASTLE ALL THE WINTER AND I DARE SAY THERE WILL BE SOME BALLS AND I WILL TAKE CARE TO GET GOOD PARTNERS FOR THEM ALL I SHOULD LIKE IT BEYOND ANYTHING SAID HER MOTHER
I REGRET TO SEE YOU STILL FLAUNT IF IT IS ONE TITHE AS PAINFUL AS THAT YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHY JERK IT OUT COMRADE BRISTOW
WICKHAM WAS NOT AT ALL MORE DISTRESSED THAN HERSELF BUT HIS MANNERS WERE ALWAYS SO PLEASING THAT HAD HIS CHARACTER AND HIS MARRIAGE BEEN EXACTLY WHAT THEY OUGHT HIS SMILES AND HIS EASY ADDRESS
SHE TURNED FROM SISTER TO SISTER DEMANDING THEIR CONGRATULATIONS AND WHEN AT LENGTH THEY ALL SAT DOWN LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND THE ROOM
WALLER WAS UP ALL NIGHT HE OUGHTN'T TO BE HERE AT ALL TODAY HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING HALF THE TIME HE'S ABSOLUTELY FAGGED OUT LOOK HERE YOU'D BETTER NIP BACK AND DO AS MUCH OF THE WORK AS YOU CAN I SHOULDN'T TALK TO HIM MUCH IF I WERE YOU BUCK ALONG MIKE WENT
BUT ON THIS HAPPY DAY SHE AGAIN TOOK HER SEAT AT THE HEAD OF HER TABLE AND IN SPIRITS OPPRESSIVELY HIGH
FOCUSING HIS ATTENTION WITH SOME RELUCTANCE UPON THIS BLOT ON THE HORIZON HE DISCOVERED THAT THE EXPLOITER OF RAINBOW WAISTCOATS AND SATIN TIES WAS ADDRESSING HIM I SAY SMITHY SAID BRISTOW HE SPOKE IN RATHER AN AWED VOICE
IF ONE COULD ONLY FIND IT ALTOGETHER THE CLOUD HAD LIFTED FROM THE CASH DEPARTMENT ALL WAS JOY JOLLITY AND SONG THE ATTITUDE OF COMRADE WALLER SAID PSMITH
OH MAMMA DO THE PEOPLE HEREABOUTS KNOW I AM MARRIED TO DAY I WAS AFRAID THEY MIGHT NOT AND WE OVERTOOK WILLIAM GOULDING IN HIS CURRICLE
MISTER DARCY REPEATED ELIZABETH
MOST OF THE GOALS TOWARDS WHICH THE AVERAGE MAN STRIVES STRUCK HIM AS TOO UNAMBITIOUS FOR THE PRODIGY
THERE WAS NO WANT OF DISCOURSE THE BRIDE AND HER MOTHER COULD NEITHER OF THEM TALK FAST ENOUGH AND WICKHAM WHO HAPPENED TO SIT NEAR ELIZABETH BEGAN INQUIRING AFTER HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
HOW WICKHAM AND LYDIA WERE TO BE SUPPORTED IN TOLERABLE INDEPENDENCE SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT HOW LITTLE OF PERMANENT HAPPINESS COULD BELONG TO A COUPLE WHO WERE ONLY BROUGHT TOGETHER BECAUSE THEIR PASSIONS WERE STRONGER THAN THEIR VIRTUE SHE COULD EASILY CONJECTURE
WHAT MY CURIOSITY MUST BE TO KNOW HOW A PERSON UNCONNECTED WITH ANY OF US AND COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING A STRANGER TO OUR FAMILY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AMONGST YOU AT SUCH A TIME PRAY WRITE INSTANTLY AND LET ME UNDERSTAND IT
NOBODY WILL TAKE AN OLD MAN LIKE ME HIS VOICE DIED AWAY THERE WAS A SILENCE MIKE SAT STARING MISERABLY IN FRONT OF HIM THEN QUITE SUDDENLY AN IDEA CAME TO HIM
THEY SEEMED EACH OF THEM TO HAVE THE HAPPIEST MEMORIES IN THE WORLD NOTHING OF THE PAST WAS RECOLLECTED WITH PAIN AND LYDIA LED VOLUNTARILY TO SUBJECTS WHICH HER SISTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLUDED TO FOR THE WORLD ONLY THINK OF ITS BEING THREE MONTHS SHE CRIED
MIKE WISHED HIM LUCK AND THERE WAS RAYMOND WHO DABBLED IN JOURNALISM AND WAS THE AUTHOR OF STRAIGHT TALKS TO HOUSEWIVES IN TRIFLES UNDER THE PSEUDONYM OF LADY GUSSIE WRAGGE
I SHALL LOSE MY PLACE MISTER BICKERSDYKE HAS WANTED TO GET RID OF ME FOR A LONG TIME HE NEVER LIKED ME I SHALL BE DISMISSED WHAT CAN I DO I'M AN OLD MAN
HE'S GETTING IT HOT ON THE CARPET YOU WISH TO INDICATE SAID PSMITH THAT THERE IS SOME SLIGHT DISTURBANCE SOME PASSING BREEZE BETWEEN COMRADES JACKSON AND BICKERSDYKE BRISTOW CHUCKLED BREEZE
MISTER GARDINER SOON WROTE AGAIN TO HIS BROTHER TO MISTER BENNET'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS HE BRIEFLY REPLIED WITH ASSURANCE OF HIS EAGERNESS TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF ANY OF HIS FAMILY
LET US AS YOU SAY SCUD FORTH WE WILL GO TO A MECCA WHY SO CALLED I DO NOT KNOW NOR INDEED DO I EVER HOPE TO KNOW THERE WE MAY OBTAIN AT A PRICE A PASSABLE CUP OF COFFEE AND YOU SHALL TELL ME YOUR PAINFUL STORY
BEEN LED TO MAKE MISTER DARCY ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR FEARS FOR HER SISTER FOR SINCE HER MARRIAGE WOULD SO SHORTLY GIVE THE PROPER TERMINATION TO THE ELOPEMENT
PSMITH STIRRED HIS COFFEE BEFORE REPLYING
FOR MINE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT WILL YOU HEAR IT MOST WILLINGLY YOU SHALL HAVE IT IN A FEW WORDS MISS BINGLEY SEES THAT HER BROTHER IS IN LOVE WITH YOU AND WANTS HIM TO MARRY MISS DARCY
AND HIS PROSPECTS OF FUTURE WEALTH WERE EXCEEDINGLY FAIR LADY LUCAS BEGAN DIRECTLY TO CALCULATE WITH MORE INTEREST THAN THE MATTER HAD EVER EXCITED BEFORE HOW MANY YEARS LONGER MISTER BENNET WAS LIKELY TO LIVE
I AM CONVINCED THAT MY CHANCE OF HAPPINESS WITH HIM IS AS FAIR AS MOST PEOPLE CAN BOAST ON ENTERING THE MARRIAGE STATE ELIZABETH QUIETLY ANSWERED UNDOUBTEDLY AND AFTER AN AWKWARD PAUSE
I WILL HAVE NO RESERVES FROM YOU
FROM THIS DAY YOU MUST BE A STRANGER TO ONE OF YOUR PARENTS YOUR MOTHER WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT MARRY MISTER COLLINS AND I WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO
SHE IS A VERY HEADSTRONG FOOLISH GIRL AND DOES NOT KNOW HER OWN INTEREST BUT I WILL MAKE HER KNOW IT PARDON ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MADAM CRIED MISTER COLLINS
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE DISCUSSION OF MISTER COLLINS'S OFFER WAS NOW NEARLY AT AN END AND ELIZABETH HAD ONLY TO SUFFER FROM THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS NECESSARILY ATTENDING IT
HER REFLECTIONS WERE IN GENERAL SATISFACTORY MISTER COLLINS TO BE SURE WAS NEITHER SENSIBLE NOR AGREEABLE HIS SOCIETY WAS IRKSOME AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MUST BE IMAGINARY
AND SIR WILLIAM GAVE IT AS HIS DECIDED OPINION THAT WHENEVER MISTER COLLINS SHOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THE LONGBOURN ESTATE IT WOULD BE HIGHLY EXPEDIENT THAT BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE AT SAINT JAMES'S
THAT BECAUSE MISS BINGLEY TELLS YOU HER BROTHER GREATLY ADMIRES MISS DARCY HE IS IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE LESS SENSIBLE OF YOUR MERIT THAN WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE OF YOU ON TUESDAY OR THAT IT WILL BE IN HER POWER TO PERSUADE HIM THAT INSTEAD OF BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU
WHO SUFFER AS I DO FROM NERVOUS COMPLAINTS CAN HAVE NO GREAT INCLINATION FOR TALKING
MISTER COLLINS RECEIVED AND RETURNED THESE FELICITATIONS WITH EQUAL PLEASURE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO RELATE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR INTERVIEW WITH THE RESULT OF WHICH HE TRUSTED HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED
THE STUPIDITY WITH WHICH HE WAS FAVOURED BY NATURE MUST GUARD HIS COURTSHIP FROM ANY CHARM THAT COULD MAKE A WOMAN WISH FOR ITS CONTINUANCE AND MISS LUCAS
MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
BUT THE CASE IS THIS WE ARE NOT RICH ENOUGH OR GRAND ENOUGH FOR THEM AND SHE IS THE MORE ANXIOUS TO GET MISS DARCY FOR HER BROTHER FROM THE NOTION THAT WHEN THERE HAS BEEN ONE INTERMARRIAGE SHE MAY HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN ACHIEVING A SECOND
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO BE EQUALLY SATISFIED THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD MEANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY PROTESTING AGAINST HIS PROPOSALS BUT SHE DARED NOT BELIEVE IT
MY CONDUCT MAY I FEAR BE OBJECTIONABLE IN HAVING ACCEPTED MY DISMISSION FROM YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIPS INSTEAD OF YOUR OWN BUT WE ARE ALL LIABLE TO ERROR
TO ELIZABETH HOWEVER HE VOLUNTARILY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NECESSITY OF HIS ABSENCE HAD BEEN SELF IMPOSED I FOUND SAID HE AS THE TIME DREW NEAR
MY DEAR MADAM HE REPLIED THIS INVITATION IS PARTICULARLY GRATIFYING BECAUSE IT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN HOPING TO RECEIVE
IT KEEPS HIM IN GOOD HUMOUR SAID SHE AND I AM MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN I CAN EXPRESS CHARLOTTE ASSURED HER FRIEND OF HER SATISFACTION IN BEING USEFUL
BY ENGAGING THEM TOWARDS HERSELF SUCH WAS MISS LUCAS'S SCHEME AND APPEARANCES WERE SO FAVOURABLE THAT WHEN THEY PARTED AT NIGHT
WHILE THE FAMILY WERE IN THIS CONFUSION CHARLOTTE LUCAS CAME TO SPEND THE DAY WITH THEM SHE WAS MET IN THE VESTIBULE BY LYDIA WHO FLYING TO HER CRIED IN A HALF WHISPER
WHY WILL YOU THINK SO IT MUST BE HIS OWN DOING HE IS HIS OWN MASTER BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW ALL I WILL READ YOU THE PASSAGE WHICH PARTICULARLY HURTS ME
SHE RESOLVED TO GIVE HER THE INFORMATION HERSELF AND THEREFORE CHARGED MISTER COLLINS WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONGBOURN TO DINNER TO DROP NO HINT OF WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE ANY OF THE FAMILY
THAN SHE ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND CONGRATULATED BOTH HIM AND HERSELF
FOR THOUGH FEELING ALMOST SECURE AND WITH REASON FOR CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN TOLERABLY ENCOURAGING HE WAS COMPARATIVELY DIFFIDENT SINCE THE ADVENTURE OF WEDNESDAY HIS RECEPTION HOWEVER WAS OF THE MOST FLATTERING KIND
AND THAT SHE WISHED HER ALL IMAGINABLE HAPPINESS I SEE WHAT YOU ARE FEELING REPLIED CHARLOTTE YOU MUST BE SURPRISED VERY MUCH SURPRISED SO LATELY AS MISTER COLLINS WAS WISHING TO MARRY YOU
WOULD ONLY INCREASE THE IRRITATION SHE TALKED ON THEREFORE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FROM ANY OF THEM TILL THEY WERE JOINED BY MISTER COLLINS
MISTER COLLINS MEANWHILE WAS MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE ON WHAT HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT TOO WELL OF HIMSELF TO COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVES HIS COUSIN COULD REFUSE HIM AND THOUGH HIS PRIDE WAS HURT
SHE ADDED IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
HAD MY FAIR COUSIN HONOURED ME WITH HER HAND FOR I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT RESIGNATION IS NEVER SO PERFECT AS WHEN THE BLESSING DENIED BEGINS TO LOSE SOMEWHAT OF ITS VALUE IN OUR ESTIMATION
THERE WAS A SOLIDITY IN HIS REFLECTIONS WHICH OFTEN STRUCK HER AND THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO CLEVER AS HERSELF SHE THOUGHT THAT IF ENCOURAGED TO READ AND IMPROVE HIMSELF BY SUCH AN EXAMPLE AS HERS
MISTER COLLINS WAS ALSO IN THE SAME STATE OF ANGRY PRIDE ELIZABETH HAD HOPED THAT HIS RESENTMENT MIGHT SHORTEN HIS VISIT BUT HIS PLAN DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY IT HE WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE GONE ON SATURDAY
TO WHICH MISS BINGLEY LOOKS FORWARD MAY ARRIVE EARLIER THAN SHE IS AWARE AND THAT THE DELIGHTFUL INTERCOURSE YOU HAVE KNOWN AS FRIENDS WILL BE RENEWED WITH YET GREATER SATISFACTION AS SISTERS MISTER BINGLEY WILL NOT BE DETAINED IN LONDON BY THEM
AND ANSWER EVERY WISH OF HER HEART THEY AGREED THAT MISSUS BENNET SHOULD ONLY HEAR OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT BEING ALARMED ON THE SCORE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT BUT EVEN THIS PARTIAL COMMUNICATION GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN
AND ATTENDED THEM TO THEIR AUNT'S WHERE HIS REGRET AND VEXATION AND THE CONCERN OF EVERYBODY
HOWEVER OPENLY OR ARTFULLY SPOKEN COULD INFLUENCE A YOUNG MAN SO TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF EVERYONE SHE REPRESENTED TO HER SISTER AS FORCIBLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT SHE FELT ON THE SUBJECT
AND THAT IF SHE SUSPECTS THE NATURE OF MY FEELINGS FOR HIM SHE MEANS MOST KINDLY TO PUT ME ON MY GUARD CAN THERE BE ANY OTHER OPINION ON THE SUBJECT YES THERE CAN
WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN HANDSOME SHE FELT ALL THE GOOD LUCK OF IT THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE BUSINESS WAS THE SURPRISE IT MUST OCCASION TO ELIZABETH BENNET
AS FOR MY FAIR COUSINS THOUGH MY ABSENCE MAY NOT BE LONG ENOUGH TO RENDER IT NECESSARY
AND SHE BEWAILED IT AS EXCEEDINGLY UNLUCKY THAT THE LADIES SHOULD HAPPEN TO GO AWAY JUST AS THEY WERE ALL GETTING SO INTIMATE TOGETHER AFTER LAMENTING IT HOWEVER AT SOME LENGTH
I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME FOR THERE IS SUCH FUN HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED THIS MORNING
YOU CANNOT BE TOO MUCH UPON YOUR GUARD RISK ANYTHING RATHER THAN HER DISPLEASURE AND IF YOU FIND IT LIKELY TO BE RAISED BY YOUR COMING TO US AGAIN WHICH I SHOULD THINK EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
AND HER ASTONISHMENT WAS CONSEQUENTLY SO GREAT AS TO OVERCOME AT FIRST THE BOUNDS OF DECORUM AND SHE COULD NOT HELP CRYING OUT ENGAGED TO MISTER COLLINS
STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND BE SATISFIED THAT WE SHALL TAKE NO OFFENCE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MY GRATITUDE IS WARMLY EXCITED BY SUCH AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION
I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN TALKING TO UNDUTIFUL CHILDREN
IN A VOICE THAT MARKED HIS DISPLEASURE TO RESENT THE BEHAVIOUR OF YOUR DAUGHTER RESIGNATION TO INEVITABLE EVILS IS THE DUTY OF US ALL THE PECULIAR DUTY OF A YOUNG MAN
AND IF UPON MATURE DELIBERATION YOU FIND THAT THE MISERY OF DISOBLIGING HIS TWO SISTERS IS MORE THAN EQUIVALENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF BEING HIS WIFE I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO REFUSE HIM
RELATED THE EVENT OF THE DAY BEFORE THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTER COLLINS'S FANCYING HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER FRIEND HAD ONCE OCCURRED TO ELIZABETH WITHIN THE LAST DAY OR TWO BUT THAT CHARLOTTE COULD ENCOURAGE HIM
THAT I HAD BETTER NOT MEET MISTER DARCY THAT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM THE SAME PARTY WITH HIM FOR SO MANY HOURS TOGETHER MIGHT BE MORE THAN I COULD BEAR AND THAT SCENES MIGHT ARISE UNPLEASANT TO MORE THAN MYSELF
AND IT WAS MOST ACCEPTABLE AS AN OCCASION OF INTRODUCING HIM TO HER FATHER AND MOTHER SOON AFTER THEIR RETURN A LETTER WAS DELIVERED TO MISS BENNET
WHO ACCEPTED HIM SOLELY FROM THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED DESIRE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT CARED NOT HOW SOON THAT ESTABLISHMENT WERE GAINED SIR WILLIAM AND LADY LUCAS WERE SPEEDILY APPLIED TO FOR THEIR CONSENT
FOR THE CURIOSITY EXCITED BY HIS LONG ABSENCE BURST FORTH IN SUCH VERY DIRECT QUESTIONS ON HIS RETURN AS REQUIRED SOME INGENUITY TO EVADE AND HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME EXERCISING GREAT SELF DENIAL
ELIZABETH PASSED QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM JANE AND KITTY FOLLOWED BUT LYDIA STOOD HER GROUND DETERMINED TO HEAR ALL SHE COULD AND CHARLOTTE
AND IF MY MANNER HAS BEEN AT ALL REPREHENSIBLE
AND OCCASIONALLY FROM SOME PEEVISH ALLUSIONS OF HER MOTHER AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF HIS FEELINGS WERE CHIEFLY EXPRESSED NOT BY EMBARRASSMENT OR DEJECTION OR BY TRYING TO AVOID HER
OF MY ROOM I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE THE LIBRARY TO MYSELF AS SOON AS MAY BE NOT YET HOWEVER IN SPITE OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER HUSBAND DID MISSUS BENNET GIVE UP THE POINT
AND SAW HER DWELLING INTENTLY ON SOME PARTICULAR PASSAGES JANE RECOLLECTED HERSELF SOON AND PUTTING THE LETTER AWAY TRIED TO JOIN WITH HER USUAL CHEERFULNESS IN THE GENERAL CONVERSATION
AND THAT IT AMPLY REPAID HER FOR THE LITTLE SACRIFICE OF HER TIME THIS WAS VERY AMIABLE BUT CHARLOTTE'S KINDNESS EXTENDED FARTHER THAN ELIZABETH HAD ANY CONCEPTION OF
I HAVE CERTAINLY MEANT WELL THROUGH THE WHOLE AFFAIR MY OBJECT HAS BEEN TO SECURE AN AMIABLE COMPANION FOR MYSELF
BUT IF SHE IS REALLY HEADSTRONG AND FOOLISH I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE WOULD ALTOGETHER BE A VERY DESIRABLE WIFE TO A MAN IN MY SITUATION WHO NATURALLY LOOKS FOR HAPPINESS IN THE MARRIAGE STATE
MISTER COLLINS WAS NOT LEFT LONG TO THE SILENT CONTEMPLATION OF HIS SUCCESSFUL LOVE FOR MISSUS BENNET HAVING DAWDLED ABOUT IN THE VESTIBULE TO WATCH FOR THE END OF THE CONFERENCE NO SOONER SAW ELIZABETH OPEN THE DOOR
WHO CAME TO TELL THE SAME NEWS AND NO SOONER HAD THEY ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE MISSUS BENNET WAS ALONE THAN SHE LIKEWISE BEGAN ON THE SUBJECT CALLING ON MISS LUCAS FOR HER COMPASSION
AND HOWEVER UNCERTAIN OF GIVING HAPPINESS MUST BE THEIR PLEASANTEST PRESERVATIVE FROM WANT THIS PRESERVATIVE SHE HAD NOW OBTAINED AND AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN
SHE ADDED THAT LIZZY SHALL BE BROUGHT TO REASON
IT IS UNLUCKY SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT PAUSE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT MAY WE NOT HOPE THAT THE PERIOD OF FUTURE HAPPINESS
IS HEIGHTENED INTO SOMETHING STILL MORE INTERESTING
THE STEADY COUNTENANCE WHICH MISS LUCAS HAD COMMANDED IN TELLING HER STORY GAVE WAY TO A MOMENTARY CONFUSION HERE ON RECEIVING SO DIRECT A REPROACH THOUGH AS IT WAS NO MORE THAN SHE EXPECTED
HE IMAGINED THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TO LONDON MIGHT BE CONCLUDED IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN IT CANNOT BE SO AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVINCED THAT WHEN CHARLES GETS TO TOWN HE WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE IT AGAIN
SIR YOU QUITE MISUNDERSTAND ME SAID MISSUS BENNET ALARMED LIZZY IS ONLY HEADSTRONG IN SUCH MATTERS AS THESE IN EVERYTHING ELSE SHE IS AS GOOD NATURED A GIRL AS EVER LIVED
AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH WE ARE SCARCELY LESS EAGER TO MEET HER AGAIN I REALLY DO NOT THINK GEORGIANA DARCY HAS HER EQUAL FOR BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE AFFECTION SHE INSPIRES IN LOUISA AND MYSELF
MY DEAR MADAM REPLIED HE LET US BE FOR EVER SILENT ON THIS POINT FAR BE IT FROM ME HE PRESENTLY CONTINUED
SHE FOLLOWS HIM TO TOWN IN HOPE OF KEEPING HIM THERE AND TRIES TO PERSUADE YOU THAT HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU JANE SHOOK HER HEAD INDEED JANE YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE ME
AND YOU MAY BE VERY CERTAIN THAT I SHALL AVAIL MYSELF OF IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED AND MISTER BENNET WHO COULD BY NO MEANS WISH FOR SO SPEEDY A RETURN
SAID JANE AS SHE FINISHED IT IS IT NOT CLEAR ENOUGH DOES IT NOT EXPRESSLY DECLARE THAT CAROLINE NEITHER EXPECTS NOR WISHES ME TO BE HER SISTER THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HER BROTHER'S INDIFFERENCE
BUT IT IS ALWAYS SO THOSE WHO DO NOT COMPLAIN ARE NEVER PITIED HER DAUGHTERS LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THIS EFFUSION
WITHOUT HAVING PAID YOURSELF AND MISTER BENNET THE COMPLIMENT OF REQUESTING YOU TO INTERPOSE YOUR AUTHORITY IN MY BEHALF
I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF UNDERSTANDING YOU SAID HE
BUT ELIZABETH FELT AN ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH DREW OFF HER ATTENTION EVEN FROM WICKHAM AND NO SOONER HAD HE AND HIS COMPANION TAKEN LEAVE THAN A GLANCE FROM JANE INVITED HER TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
AFTER BREAKFAST THE GIRLS WALKED TO MERYTON TO INQUIRE IF MISTER WICKHAM WERE RETURNED AND TO LAMENT OVER HIS ABSENCE FROM THE NETHERFIELD BALL HE JOINED THEM ON THEIR ENTERING THE TOWN
WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUED BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON ELIZABETH WOULD WONDER AND PROBABLY WOULD BLAME HER AND THOUGH HER RESOLUTION WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN HER FEELINGS MUST BE HURT
AND SOON DINING AT LONGBOURN AND THE CONCLUSION OF ALL WAS THE COMFORTABLE DECLARATION THAT THOUGH HE HAD BEEN INVITED ONLY TO A FAMILY DINNER SHE WOULD TAKE CARE TO HAVE TWO FULL COURSES
SHE TALKED TO ELIZABETH AGAIN AND AGAIN COAXED AND THREATENED HER BY TURNS SHE ENDEAVOURED TO SECURE JANE IN HER INTEREST BUT JANE WITH ALL POSSIBLE MILDNESS DECLINED INTERFERING
IS THAT SHE IS DECEIVING HERSELF THAT IS RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE STARTED A MORE HAPPY IDEA SINCE YOU WILL NOT TAKE COMFORT IN MINE BELIEVE HER TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL MEANS
WHEN I CALL CHARLES MOST CAPABLE OF ENGAGING ANY WOMAN'S HEART WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOUR AN ATTACHMENT AND NOTHING TO PREVENT IT AM I WRONG MY DEAREST JANE
THAT WHEN CALLED INTO ACTION SHE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED EVERY BETTER FEELING TO WORLDLY ADVANTAGE CHARLOTTE THE WIFE OF MISTER COLLINS WAS A MOST HUMILIATING PICTURE
AND THE BOYS WERE RELIEVED FROM THEIR APPREHENSION OF CHARLOTTE'S DYING AN OLD MAID CHARLOTTE HERSELF WAS TOLERABLY COMPOSED SHE HAD GAINED HER POINT AND HAD TIME TO CONSIDER OF IT
THE WHOLE FAMILY IN SHORT WERE PROPERLY OVERJOYED ON THE OCCASION THE YOUNGER GIRLS FORMED HOPES OF COMING OUT A YEAR OR TWO SOONER THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE DONE
BUT BY STIFFNESS OF MANNER AND RESENTFUL SILENCE HE SCARCELY EVER SPOKE TO HER AND THE ASSIDUOUS ATTENTIONS WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO SENSIBLE OF HIMSELF WERE TRANSFERRED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TO MISS LUCAS
SINCE THE REFUSAL WHICH HIS COUSIN HAD STEADFASTLY GIVEN HIM WOULD NATURALLY FLOW FROM HER BASHFUL MODESTY AND THE GENUINE DELICACY OF HER CHARACTER THIS INFORMATION HOWEVER STARTLED MISSUS BENNET
CAROLINE IS INCAPABLE OF WILFULLY DECEIVING ANYONE
AND MISSUS BENNET WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CORDIALITY SAID HOW HAPPY THEY SHOULD BE TO SEE HIM AT LONGBOURN AGAIN
AS TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING THE LOSS OF THE THREE OF WHOM WE SHALL DEPRIVE YOU IT IS EVIDENT BY THIS ADDED JANE THAT HE COMES BACK NO MORE THIS WINTER
MISS LUCAS PERCEIVED HIM FROM AN UPPER WINDOW AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND INSTANTLY SET OUT TO MEET HIM ACCIDENTALLY IN THE LANE BUT LITTLE HAD SHE DARED TO HOPE THAT SO MUCH LOVE AND ELOQUENCE AWAITED HER THERE
CAROLINE DECIDEDLY SAYS THAT NONE OF THE PARTY WILL RETURN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE THIS WINTER I WILL READ IT TO YOU WHEN MY BROTHER LEFT US YESTERDAY
I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE I AM NOT ROMANTIC YOU KNOW I NEVER WAS I ASK ONLY A COMFORTABLE HOME AND CONSIDERING MISTER COLLINS'S CHARACTER
AND ELIZABETH SOMETIMES WITH REAL EARNESTNESS AND SOMETIMES WITH PLAYFUL GAIETY REPLIED TO HER ATTACKS THOUGH HER MANNER VARIED HOWEVER HER DETERMINATION NEVER DID
IN INDULGING THE HOPE OF AN EVENT WHICH WILL SECURE THE HAPPINESS OF SO MANY
EVEN SUPPOSING THE BEST IN ACCEPTING A MAN WHOSE SISTERS AND FRIENDS ARE ALL WISHING HIM TO MARRY ELSEWHERE YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF SAID ELIZABETH
THE STRANGENESS OF MISTER COLLINS'S MAKING TWO OFFERS OF MARRIAGE WITHIN THREE DAYS WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON OF HIS BEING NOW ACCEPTED SHE HAD ALWAYS FELT THAT CHARLOTTE'S OPINION OF MATRIMONY WAS NOT EXACTLY LIKE HER OWN
THE IDEA OF HIS RETURNING NO MORE ELIZABETH TREATED WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT IT APPEARED TO HER MERELY THE SUGGESTION OF CAROLINE'S INTERESTED WISHES AND SHE COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSE THAT THOSE WISHES
NOT EXCEPTING MY COUSIN ELIZABETH WITH PROPER CIVILITIES THE LADIES THEN WITHDREW
IN AS SHORT A TIME AS MISTER COLLINS'S LONG SPEECHES WOULD ALLOW EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED BETWEEN THEM TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE
HE WILL HAVE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SEEING HER ON THE MOST INTIMATE FOOTING HER RELATIONS ALL WISH THE CONNECTION AS MUCH AS HIS OWN AND A SISTER'S PARTIALITY IS NOT MISLEADING ME I THINK
BUT HERE SHE DID INJUSTICE TO THE FIRE AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS CHARACTER FOR IT LED HIM TO ESCAPE OUT OF LONGBOURN HOUSE THE NEXT MORNING WITH ADMIRABLE SLYNESS AND HASTEN TO LUCAS LODGE TO THROW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
BUT STILL HE WOULD BE HER HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING HIGHLY EITHER OF MEN OR MATRIMONY MARRIAGE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER OBJECT
AND ON PERCEIVING WHOM SHE SAID TO THE GIRLS
NO ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN YOU TOGETHER CAN DOUBT HIS AFFECTION MISS BINGLEY I AM SURE CANNOT SHE IS NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HALF AS MUCH LOVE IN MISTER DARCY FOR HERSELF
THE BENNETS WERE ENGAGED TO DINE WITH THE LUCASES AND AGAIN DURING THE CHIEF OF THE DAY WAS MISS LUCAS SO KIND AS TO LISTEN TO MISTER COLLINS ELIZABETH TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING HER
FOR HE WAS LONGING TO PUBLISH HIS PROSPEROUS LOVE AS HE WAS TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TOO EARLY ON THE MORROW TO SEE ANY OF THE FAMILY THE CEREMONY OF LEAVE TAKING WAS PERFORMED WHEN THE LADIES MOVED FOR THE NIGHT
IMMEDIATELY SAID BUT IS THERE NOT DANGER OF LADY CATHERINE'S DISAPPROBATION HERE MY GOOD SIR YOU HAD BETTER NEGLECT YOUR RELATIONS THAN RUN THE RISK OF OFFENDING YOUR PATRONESS MY DEAR SIR
SHE SOON REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND CALMLY REPLIED WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED MY DEAR ELIZA
AND HAD SOON THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ITS HAPPY EFFECT JANE'S TEMPER WAS NOT DESPONDING AND SHE WAS GRADUALLY LED TO HOPE THOUGH THE DIFFIDENCE OF AFFECTION SOMETIMES OVERCAME THE HOPE THAT BINGLEY WOULD RETURN TO NETHERFIELD
IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
HE WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID THE NOTICE OF HIS COUSINS FROM A CONVICTION THAT IF THEY SAW HIM DEPART THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO CONJECTURE HIS DESIGN
THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED A SHEET OF ELEGANT LITTLE HOT PRESSED PAPER WELL COVERED WITH A LADY'S FAIR FLOWING HAND AND ELIZABETH SAW HER SISTER'S COUNTENANCE CHANGE AS SHE READ IT
DETAINED FIRST BY THE CIVILITY OF MISTER COLLINS WHOSE INQUIRIES AFTER HERSELF AND ALL HER FAMILY WERE VERY MINUTE AND THEN BY A LITTLE CURIOSITY SATISFIED HERSELF WITH WALKING TO THE WINDOW AND PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR
HER MISTER BENNET RAISED HIS EYES FROM HIS BOOK AS SHE ENTERED AND FIXED THEM ON HER FACE WITH A CALM UNCONCERN WHICH WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALTERED BY HER COMMUNICATION
IF THEREFORE SHE ACTUALLY PERSISTS IN REJECTING MY SUIT PERHAPS IT WERE BETTER NOT TO FORCE HER INTO ACCEPTING ME BECAUSE IF LIABLE TO SUCH DEFECTS OF TEMPER SHE COULD NOT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO MY FELICITY
YOUR MOTHER INSISTS UPON YOUR ACCEPTING IT IS IT NOT SO MISSUS BENNET YES OR I WILL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AN UNHAPPY ALTERNATIVE IS BEFORE YOU ELIZABETH
SEEMED ALMOST AS FAR FROM POSSIBILITY
EXHIBITS HUMAN NATURE IN ITS MOST ABJECT AND HUMILIATING ATTITUDE SUCH AN ATTITUDE WOULD LITTLE SUIT THE PURPOSES OF THE POET WHAT THEN MUST HE DO HE MUST THROW THE INTEREST ON THE MURDERER
EMPTY HE THREW THE BOTTLE TO THE ENGLISHMAN WHO CAUGHT IT NEATLY DOLOKHOV JUMPED DOWN HE SMELT STRONGLY OF RUM WELL DONE FINE FELLOW THERE'S A BET FOR YOU DEVIL TAKE YOU CAME FROM DIFFERENT SIDES
WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TRY AND TELL THE STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AS IF IT WERE A STORY OR WHETHER TO TELL IT FROM THIS DISTANCE OF TIME AS IT REACHED ME FROM THE LIPS OF LEONORA OR FROM THOSE OF EDWARD HIMSELF
HE GAVE AN ORANGE EVERY MORNING AND THEY LASTED HIM RIGHT ROUND THE GIRDLE OF THIS MIGHTY GLOBE OF OURS WHEN THEY WERE AT NORTH CAPE EVEN HE SAW ON THE HORIZON POOR DEAR THIN MAN THAT HE WAS A LIGHTHOUSE
IT HAD CERTAINLY JUMPED OR SQUEAKED OR SOMETHING JUST SUFFICIENTLY TO TAKE IN THE DOCTORS BUT IT APPEARS THAT THAT WAS BECAUSE OF AN ODD FORMATION OF THE LUNGS I DON'T MUCH UNDERSTAND ABOUT THESE MATTERS
FOR HE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN THE EFFECT EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE THE REASON IS THAT HE ALLOWS HIS UNDERSTANDING TO OVERRULE HIS EYES
AND GREY AND PINK PALAZZI AND WALLED TOWNS A MILE OR SO BACK FROM THE SEA ON THE MEDITERRANEAN BETWEEN LEGHORN AND NAPLES NOT ONE OF THEM DID WE SEE MORE THAN ONCE
ANATOLE WITH HIS SWAGGERING AIR STRODE UP TO THE WINDOW HE WANTED TO SMASH SOMETHING PUSHING AWAY THE FOOTMEN HE TUGGED AT THE FRAME BUT COULD NOT MOVE IT HE SMASHED A PANE
AND AS THIS EFFECT IS MARVELLOUSLY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE DIALOGUES AND SOLILOQUIES THEMSELVES SO IT IS FINALLY CONSUMMATED BY THE EXPEDIENT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IT IS TO THIS THAT I NOW SOLICIT THE READER'S ATTENTION
THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DOING SINCE HIS TIME OR NOTHING THAT'S WORTH SPEAKING OF BUT THIS IS WRONG FOR IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT ALL MEN TO BE GREAT ARTISTS AND BORN WITH THE GENIUS OF MISTER WILLIAMS
BEGAN REPEATING THE TERMS OF THE WAGER TO HIM IN ENGLISH WAIT CRIED DOLOKHOV HAMMERING WITH THE BOTTLE ON THE WINDOW SILL TO ATTRACT ATTENTION WAIT A BIT KURAGIN LISTEN
AND HALF A DOZEN FOLDING CHAIRS IN A SPECIAL CASE THAT HE ALWAYS KEPT IN HIS CABIN THERE MUST HAVE BEEN HALF A CARGO OF FRUIT FOR TO EVERY PERSON ON BOARD THE SEVERAL STEAMERS THAT THEY EMPLOYED TO EVERY PERSON WITH WHOM HE HAD SO MUCH AS A NODDING ACQUAINTANCE
FOR NINE MONTHS OR SO IT WOULD MANUFACTURE BUTTONS OUT OF BONE THEN IT WOULD SUDDENLY PRODUCE BRASS BUTTONS FOR COACHMEN'S LIVERIES THEN IT WOULD TAKE A TURN AT EMBOSSED TIN LIDS FOR CANDY BOXES
THEY POLISHED HIM UP AND HER HUSBAND REMONSTRATED SERIOUSLY WITH HER VIDAL WAS YOU SEE A GREAT POET AND IT WAS NOT PROPER TO TREAT A GREAT POET WITH INDIFFERENCE SO PEIRE VIDAL DECLARED HIMSELF EMPEROR OF JERUSALEM OR SOMEWHERE
I KNOW I WAS FOR DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY WHOLE ATTENTIONS MY WHOLE ENDEAVOURS WERE TO KEEP POOR DEAR FLORENCE ON TO TOPICS LIKE THE FINDS AT CNOSSOS AND THE MENTAL SPIRITUALITY OF WALTER PATER
THIS TOGETHER WITH THE RESOLUTE INSOLENT INTELLIGENCE OF HIS EYES PRODUCED AN EFFECT WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO NOTICE HIS FACE DOLOKHOV WAS A MAN OF SMALL MEANS AND NO CONNECTIONS
AND IT STRUCK HIM THAT THE THINGS TO TAKE FOR THAT PURPOSE WERE ORANGES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THE ORANGE COUNTRY AND COMFORTABLE FOLDING CHAIRS SO HE BOUGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CASES OF ORANGES THE GREAT COOL CALIFORNIA ORANGES
NOT SO MUCH AS TO CARCASSONNE ITSELF WE TALKED OF IT OF COURSE BUT I GUESS FLORENCE GOT ALL SHE WANTED OUT OF ONE LOOK AT A PLACE SHE HAD THE SEEING EYE I HAVEN'T UNFORTUNATELY SO THAT THE WORLD IS FULL OF PLACES TO WHICH I WANT TO RETURN
AND WE DESCENDED ON IT FROM THE HIGH CLEAR WINDSWEPT WASTE OF THE NEW FOREST I TELL YOU IT WAS AMAZING TO ARRIVE THERE FROM WATERBURY AND IT CAME INTO MY HEAD
STOOD ON THE TOP DOORSTEP WITH A BUTLER AND FOOTMAN AND A MAID OR SO BEHIND HER AND SHE JUST SAID SO GLAD YOU'VE COME AS IF I'D RUN DOWN TO LUNCH FROM A TOWN TEN MILES AWAY INSTEAD OF HAVING COME HALF THE WORLD OVER AT THE CALL OF TWO URGENT TELEGRAMS
HIS HEAD AND ARM WAVERED STILL MORE WITH THE STRAIN ONE HAND MOVED AS IF TO CLUTCH THE WINDOW SILL BUT REFRAINED FROM TOUCHING IT PIERRE AGAIN COVERED HIS EYES AND THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER OPEN THEM AGAIN SUDDENLY HE WAS AWARE OF A STIR ALL AROUND HE LOOKED UP
PEIRE VIDAL FELL ALL OVER THE LADY'S BED WHILE THE HUSBAND WHO WAS A MOST FEROCIOUS WARRIOR REMONSTRATED SOME MORE ABOUT THE COURTESY THAT IS DUE TO GREAT POETS BUT I SUPPOSE LA LOUVE WAS THE MORE FEROCIOUS OF THE TWO ANYHOW
I GUESS FLORENCE WANTED TO RAISE THE CULTURE OF THE STUYVESANT CROWD AND DID IT AS SHE MIGHT HAVE GONE IN SLUMMING INTELLECTUAL SLUMMING THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO LEAVE THE WORLD A LITTLE MORE ELEVATED THAN SHE FOUND IT POOR DEAR THING
IN ORDINARY CASES WHERE THE SYMPATHY IS WHOLLY DIRECTED TO THE CASE OF THE MURDERED PERSON IS AN INCIDENT OF COARSE AND VULGAR HORROR AND FOR THIS REASON THAT IT FLINGS THE INTEREST EXCLUSIVELY UPON THE NATURAL
THAT IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THAT ANYTHING ESSENTIALLY CALAMITOUS COULD HAPPEN TO THAT PLACE AND THOSE PEOPLE I TELL YOU IT WAS THE VERY SPIRIT OF PEACE AND LEONORA BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING WITH HER COILS OF YELLOW HAIR
THEN THE WORLD OF DARKNESS PASSES AWAY LIKE A PAGEANTRY IN THE CLOUDS THE KNOCKING AT THE GATE IS HEARD AND IT MAKES KNOWN AUDIBLY THAT THE REACTION HAS COMMENCED THE HUMAN HAS MADE ITS REFLUX UPON THE FIENDISH
PRODUCED TO MY FEELINGS AN EFFECT FOR WHICH I NEVER COULD ACCOUNT THE EFFECT WAS THAT IT REFLECTED BACK UPON THE MURDER A PECULIAR AWFULNESS AND A DEPTH OF SOLEMNITY
SOBER RING CRIED FROM THE WINDOW COME HERE PART THE BETS THIS WAS DOLOKHOV AN OFFICER OF THE SEMENOV REGIMENT A NOTORIOUS GAMBLER AND DUELIST WHO WAS LIVING WITH ANATOLE PIERRE SMILED LOOKING ABOUT HIM MERRILY
THAT A STORY YOU HAVEN'T AN IDEA OF THE QUEER OLD FASHIONEDNESS OF FLORENCE'S AUNTS THE MISSES HURLBIRD NOR YET OF HER UNCLE AN EXTRAORDINARILY LOVABLE MAN THAT UNCLE JOHN
PERHAPS IF IT WEREN'T SO I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO CATCH HOLD OF NOW IS ALL THIS DIGRESSION OR ISN'T IT DIGRESSION AGAIN I DON'T KNOW YOU THE LISTENER SIT OPPOSITE ME BUT
THE ENGLISHMAN NODDED BUT GAVE NO INDICATION WHETHER HE INTENDED TO ACCEPT THIS CHALLENGE OR NOT ANATOLE DID NOT RELEASE HIM AND THOUGH HE KEPT NODDING TO SHOW THAT HE UNDERSTOOD ANATOLE WENT ON TRANSLATING DOLOKHOV'S WORDS INTO ENGLISH
I MEAN THAT SHE DIDN'T LOOK AS IF SHE WERE SEEING POETIC DREAMS OR LOOKING THROUGH YOU FOR SHE HARDLY EVER DID LOOK AT YOU HOLDING UP ONE HAND AS IF SHE WISHED TO SILENCE ANY OBJECTION OR ANY COMMENT FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SHE WOULD TALK
HE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE IN FORMING THE CHARACTER OF MY POOR DEAR WIFE JUST BEFORE THEY SET OUT FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR THE SOUTH SEAS
I'LL DO THE SAME THING HE SUDDENLY CRIED EVEN WITHOUT A BET THERE TELL THEM TO BRING ME A BOTTLE I'LL DO IT BRING A BOTTLE LET HIM DO IT LET HIM DO IT SAID DOLOKHOV SMILING WHAT NEXT HAVE YOU GONE MAD NO ONE WOULD LET YOU WHY
I SHOULD LIKE TO GO TO KURAGIN'S THOUGHT HE BUT HE IMMEDIATELY RECALLED HIS PROMISE TO PRINCE ANDREW NOT TO GO THERE THEN AS HAPPENS TO PEOPLE OF WEAK CHARACTER
DEEP DAMNATION OF HIS TAKING OFF THIS WAS TO BE EXPRESSED WITH PECULIAR ENERGY
BUT THOUGH IN MACBETH THE STRIFE OF MIND IS GREATER THAN IN HIS WIFE THE TIGER SPIRIT NOT SO AWAKE AND HIS FEELINGS CAUGHT CHIEFLY BY CONTAGION FROM HER
THESE FELLOWS MUST BE VERY LONELY LET'S TAKE THEM SOME ORANGES SO HE HAD A BOATLOAD OF HIS FRUIT OUT AND HAD HIMSELF ROWED TO THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE HORIZON THE FOLDING CHAIRS HE LENT TO ANY LADY THAT HE CAME ACROSS AND LIKED OR WHO SEEMED TIRED AND INVALIDISH ON THE SHIP
HAVE A TALK WITH HIM AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS CAME ONE FROM LEONORA SAYING YES PLEASE DO COME YOU COULD BE SO HELPFUL IT WAS AS IF HE HAD SENT THE CABLE WITHOUT CONSULTING HER AND HAD AFTERWARDS TOLD HER INDEED THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH WHAT HAD HAPPENED EXCEPT THAT
TO REPRESENT THE EFFECT OF TWO WALLS STANDING AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER OR THE APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES ON EACH SIDE OF A STREET AS SEEN BY A PERSON LOOKING DOWN THE STREET FROM ONE EXTREMITY NOW IN ALL CASES
DOLOKHOV COULD PLAY ALL GAMES AND NEARLY ALWAYS WON HOWEVER MUCH HE DRANK HE NEVER LOST HIS CLEARHEADEDNESS BOTH KURAGIN AND DOLOKHOV WERE AT THAT TIME NOTORIOUS AMONG THE RAKES AND SCAPEGRACES OF PETERSBURG
YET HOWEVER OBSTINATELY I ENDEAVORED WITH MY UNDERSTANDING TO COMPREHEND THIS FOR MANY YEARS I NEVER COULD SEE WHY IT SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH AN EFFECT HERE I PAUSE FOR ONE MOMENT TO EXHORT THE READER
THE MORE HE FELT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GOING TO SLEEP ON SUCH A NIGHT
HE STOOPED AND POINTED TO THE SLOPING LEDGE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND WITHOUT HOLDING ON TO ANYTHING IS THAT RIGHT QUITE RIGHT SAID THE ENGLISHMAN ANATOLE TURNED TO THE ENGLISHMAN AND TAKING HIM BY ONE OF THE BUTTONS OF HIS COAT
PIERRE TOOK HIS HANDS FROM HIS EYES DOLOKHOV STILL SAT IN THE SAME POSITION
THIS WAS TO BE EXPRESSED AND ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT AS WELL AS TO MAKE IT A MORE PROPORTIONABLE ANTAGONIST TO THE UNOFFENDING NATURE OF THEIR VICTIM THE GRACIOUS DUNCAN AND ADEQUATELY TO EXPOUND THE
THE ANIMAL'S ACTION ITS HIGH STEPPING ITS SKIN THAT WAS LIKE SATIN AND THE PEACE AND THE RED CHEEKS AND THE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL OLD HOUSE JUST NEAR BRANSHAW TELERAGH IT WAS
DOLOKHOV WAS OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WITH CURLY HAIR AND LIGHT BLUE EYES HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE LIKE ALL INFANTRY OFFICERS HE WORE NO MUSTACHE SO THAT HIS MOUTH THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE OF HIS FACE WAS CLEARLY SEEN
SHE WAS YET A GRADUATE OF POUGHKEEPSIE I NEVER COULD IMAGINE HOW SHE DID IT THE QUEER CHATTERY PERSON THAT SHE WAS WITH THE FAR AWAY LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH WASN'T HOWEVER IN THE LEAST ROMANTIC
THE FACT IS THAT THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WEAK AND FLUTTERING HEART DIDN'T WANT HIS FACTORY TO MANUFACTURE ANYTHING AT ALL HE WANTED TO RETIRE AND HE DID RETIRE WHEN HE WAS SEVENTY BUT HE WAS SO WORRIED AT HAVING ALL THE STREET BOYS IN THE TOWN POINT AFTER HIM AND EXCLAIM
AND I HAD TO APPOINT TRUSTEES I DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF THEIR NOT BEING PROPERLY HANDLED YES IT WAS A GREAT WORRY AND JUST AS I HAD GOT THINGS ROUGHLY SETTLED I RECEIVED THE EXTRAORDINARY CABLE FROM ASHBURNHAM BEGGING ME TO COME BACK AND
I'LL DRINK IT LET'S HAVE A BOTTLE OF RUM SHOUTED PIERRE BANGING THE TABLE WITH A DETERMINED AND DRUNKEN GESTURE AND PREPARING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE WINDOW
NO I WON'T SAID PIERRE PUSHING ANATOLE ASIDE AND HE WENT UP TO THE WINDOW DOLOKHOV WAS HOLDING THE ENGLISHMAN'S HAND AND CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY REPEATING THE TERMS OF THE BET ADDRESSING HIMSELF PARTICULARLY TO ANATOLE AND PIERRE
LOOKING FROM UNDER HIS BROWS AT THE TIPSY GUESTS WHO WERE AGAIN CROWDING ROUND THE WINDOW AND LISTENING TO THEIR CHATTER ANATOLE KEPT ON REFILLING PIERRE'S GLASS WHILE EXPLAINING THAT DOLOKHOV WAS BETTING WITH STEVENS AN ENGLISH NAVAL OFFICER
IN WHICH NOT ONLY THE UNDERSTANDING IS ALLOWED TO OVERRULE THE EYES BUT WHERE THE UNDERSTANDING IS POSITIVELY ALLOWED TO OBLITERATE THE EYES AS IT WERE
TOWNS WITH THE BLINDING WHITE SUN UPON THEM STONE PINES AGAINST THE BLUE OF THE SKY CORNERS OF GABLES ALL CARVED AND PAINTED WITH STAGS AND SCARLET FLOWERS AND CROWSTEPPED GABLES WITH THE LITTLE SAINT AT THE TOP
THAT HE TRIED TAKING A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD AND FLORENCE AND A YOUNG MAN CALLED JIMMY WENT WITH HIM
BENEATH THE TALLNESS OF THE STONE PINES WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING THE STONE PINE IS NO WE NEVER DID GO BACK ANYWHERE NOT TO HEIDELBERG NOT TO HAMELIN NOT TO VERONA NOT TO MONT MAJOUR
IN FACT MY UNDERSTANDING SAID POSITIVELY THAT IT COULD NOT PRODUCE ANY EFFECT BUT I KNEW BETTER I FELT THAT IT DID AND I WAITED AND CLUNG TO THE PROBLEM UNTIL FURTHER KNOWLEDGE SHOULD ENABLE ME TO SOLVE IT
I WILL CITE ONE ASK OF ANY PERSON WHATSOEVER WHO IS NOT PREVIOUSLY PREPARED FOR THE DEMAND BY A KNOWLEDGE OF PERSPECTIVE TO DRAW IN THE RUDEST WAY THE COMMONEST APPEARANCE WHICH DEPENDS UPON THE LAWS OF THAT SCIENCE AS FOR INSTANCE
ALL STRIFE OF THOUGHT ALL FLUX AND REFLUX OF PASSION AND OF PURPOSE ARE CRUSHED BY ONE OVERWHELMING PANIC THE FEAR OF INSTANT DEATH SMITES HIM WITH ITS PETRIFIC MACE
DOLOKHOV CLIMBED CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY THROUGH THE WINDOW AND LOWERED HIS LEGS PRESSING AGAINST BOTH SIDES OF THE WINDOW HE ADJUSTED HIMSELF ON HIS SEAT
UNLESS THE PERSON HAS HAPPENED TO OBSERVE IN PICTURES HOW IT IS THAT ARTISTS PRODUCE THESE EFFECTS HE WILL BE UTTERLY UNABLE TO MAKE THE SMALLEST APPROXIMATION TO IT YET WHY
THE LINES OF THAT MOUTH WERE REMARKABLY FINELY CURVED THE MIDDLE OF THE UPPER LIP FORMED A SHARP WEDGE AND CLOSED FIRMLY ON THE FIRM LOWER ONE
AND CHANCING TO WALK NEAR THE COURSE THROUGH WHICH IT PASSED HAS FELT POWERFULLY IN THE SILENCE AND DESERTION OF THE STREETS AND IN THE STAGNATION OF ORDINARY BUSINESS THE DEEP INTEREST WHICH AT THAT MOMENT WAS POSSESSING THE HEART OF MAN
AND SO GUARDED AGAINST HIS HEART AND HAVING HIS NIECE WITH HIM HE WENT ROUND THE WORLD HE WASN'T OBTRUSIVE ABOUT HIS HEART YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN HE HAD ONE HE ONLY LEFT IT TO THE PHYSICAL LABORATORY AT WATERBURY FOR THE BENEFIT OF SCIENCE
HE DESIRED SO PASSIONATELY ONCE MORE TO ENJOY THAT DISSIPATION HE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THAT HE DECIDED TO GO THE THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HIS PROMISE TO PRINCE ANDREW WAS OF NO ACCOUNT
HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS SEEN
THEY ARE TRANSFIGURED LADY MACBETH IS UNSEXED MACBETH HAS FORGOT THAT HE WAS BORN OF WOMAN BOTH ARE CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF DEVILS AND THE WORLD OF DEVILS IS SUDDENLY REVEALED
AT PRESENT SO GENERAL BY WHICH INSTEAD OF TAKING IT IN ITS PROPER SENSE AS THE ACT OF REPRODUCING IN OUR MINDS THE FEELINGS OF ANOTHER WHETHER FOR HATRED INDIGNATION LOVE PITY OR APPROBATION
AND THE HUSBAND HAD TO KNEEL DOWN AND KISS HIS FEET THOUGH LA LOUVE WOULDN'T AND PEIRE SET SAIL IN A ROWING BOAT WITH FOUR COMPANIONS TO REDEEM THE HOLY SEPULCHRE AND THEY STRUCK ON A ROCK SOMEWHERE AND AT GREAT EXPENSE THE HUSBAND HAD TO FIT OUT AN EXPEDITION TO FETCH HIM BACK AND
ANATOLE STOPPED HIM DON'T TOUCH HIM YOU'LL STARTLE HIM AND THEN HE'LL BE KILLED EH WHAT THEN EH
EMOTIONS WERE REALLY STIRRED HER LITTLE HEART MIGHT CEASE TO BEAT FOR TWELVE YEARS I HAD TO WATCH EVERY WORD THAT ANY PERSON UTTERED IN ANY CONVERSATION AND I HAD TO HEAD IT OFF WHAT THE ENGLISH CALL THINGS OFF LOVE POVERTY CRIME
FROM MY BOYISH DAYS I HAD ALWAYS FELT A GREAT PERPLEXITY ON ONE POINT IN MACBETH IT WAS THIS THE KNOCKING AT THE GATE WHICH SUCCEEDS TO THE MURDER OF DUNCAN
JUMPED ONTO THE WINDOW SILL LISTEN CRIED HE STANDING THERE AND ADDRESSING THOSE IN THE ROOM ALL WERE SILENT
AND DISSATISFIED BY ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SINCE DONE IN THAT LINE ALL OTHER MURDERS LOOK PALE BY THE DEEP CRIMSON OF HIS AND AS AN AMATEUR ONCE SAID TO ME IN A QUERULOUS TONE
BENEATH THE HIGH THIN LEAVED ELMS THE FIRST QUESTION THEY ASKED ME WAS NOT HOW I DID BUT WHAT DID I DO AND I DID NOTHING
THE GIRL WAS OUT WITH THE HOUNDS I THINK AND THAT POOR DEVIL BESIDE ME WAS IN AN AGONY
OR SOMETHING SO EXTRAORDINARY MAY HAPPEN TO ONE THAT HONOR AND DISHONOR WILL BE ALL THE SAME PIERRE OFTEN INDULGED IN REFLECTIONS OF THIS SORT NULLIFYING ALL HIS DECISIONS AND INTENTIONS HE WENT TO KURAGIN'S
AND MADE SENSIBLE ANOTHER WORLD HAS STEPPED IN
WAS DRINKING ON THE SLY WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE GLASSES FROM THE THIRD ROOM CAME SOUNDS OF LAUGHTER THE SHOUTING OF FAMILIAR VOICES THE GROWLING OF A BEAR AND GENERAL COMMOTION
THIN GENTLE AND WITH A HEART THAT MADE HIS LIFE VERY MUCH WHAT FLORENCE'S AFTERWARDS BECAME HE DIDN'T RESIDE AT STAMFORD HIS HOME WAS IN WATERBURY WHERE THE WATCHES COME FROM
AND THE HAND HOLDING THE BOTTLE WAS LIFTED HIGHER AND HIGHER AND TREMBLED WITH THE EFFORT THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTYING PERCEPTIBLY AND RISING STILL HIGHER AND HIS HEAD TILTING YET FURTHER BACK WHY IS IT SO LONG THOUGHT PIERRE
HE HAD TOLD THE GIRL AND THE GIRL TOLD THE WIFE I ARRIVED HOWEVER TOO LATE TO BE OF ANY GOOD IF I COULD HAVE BEEN OF ANY GOOD AND THEN I HAD MY FIRST TASTE OF ENGLISH LIFE IT WAS AMAZING IT WAS OVERWHELMING
THE ENGLISHMAN TOOK OUT HIS PURSE AND BEGAN COUNTING OUT THE MONEY DOLOKHOV STOOD FROWNING AND DID NOT SPEAK PIERRE JUMPED UPON THE WINDOW SILL GENTLEMEN
I HAD TO KEEP HER AT IT YOU UNDERSTAND OR SHE MIGHT DIE FOR I WAS SOLEMNLY INFORMED THAT IF SHE BECAME EXCITED OVER ANYTHING OR IF HER
FLORENCE'S AUNTS USED TO SAY THAT I MUST BE THE LAZIEST MAN IN PHILADELPHIA THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TO PHILADELPHIA AND THEY HAD THE NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE YOU SEE THE FIRST THING THEY SAID TO ME WHEN I CALLED IN ON FLORENCE IN THE LITTLE ANCIENT COLONIAL WOODEN HOUSE
ANATOLE BROUGHT TWO CANDLES AND PLACED THEM ON THE WINDOW SILL THOUGH IT WAS ALREADY QUITE LIGHT DOLOKHOV'S BACK IN HIS WHITE SHIRT AND HIS CURLY HEAD WERE LIT UP FROM BOTH SIDES EVERYONE CROWDED TO THE WINDOW THE ENGLISHMAN IN FRONT
WHICH WILL CREATE A HELL WITHIN HIM AND INTO THIS HELL WE ARE TO LOOK FOOTNOTE ONE
PIERRE STOOD SMILING BUT SILENT ONE MAN OLDER THAN THE OTHERS PRESENT SUDDENLY PUSHED FORWARD WITH A SCARED AND ANGRY LOOK AND WANTED TO SEIZE HOLD OF DOLOKHOV'S SHIRT I SAY THIS IS FOLLY HE'LL BE KILLED SAID THIS MORE SENSIBLE MAN
AND THE IMMENSE MISTRAL BLEW DOWN THAT VALLEY WHICH WAS THE WAY FROM FRANCE INTO PROVENCE SO THAT THE SILVER GREY OLIVE LEAVES APPEARED LIKE HAIR FLYING IN THE WIND
A TALL HANDSOME FELLOW WHO STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THE GROUP WITHOUT A COAT AND WITH HIS FINE LINEN SHIRT UNFASTENED IN FRONT WAIT A BIT YOU FELLOWS HERE IS PETYA GOOD MAN CRIED HE ADDRESSING PIERRE
AND MADE PALPABLE IN ORDER THAT A NEW WORLD MAY STEP IN THIS WORLD MUST FOR A TIME DISAPPEAR THE MURDERERS AND THE MURDER MUST BE INSULATED
FOR THE SAKE OF GRATIFYING HIS OWN ENORMOUS AND TEEMING FACULTY OF CREATION SHAKSPEARE HAS INTRODUCED TWO MURDERERS AND AS USUAL IN HIS HANDS THEY ARE REMARKABLY DISCRIMINATED
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED SUDDENLY DOLOKHOV MADE A BACKWARD MOVEMENT WITH HIS SPINE AND HIS ARM TREMBLED NERVOUSLY THIS WAS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE HIS WHOLE BODY TO SLIP AS HE SAT ON THE SLOPING LEDGE AS HE BEGAN SLIPPING DOWN
DROPPED HIS HANDS TOOK THE BOTTLE AND LIFTED IT TO HIS LIPS THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND RAISED HIS FREE HAND TO BALANCE HIMSELF
LAS TOURS OF THE FOUR CASTLES HAD
YOU ARE SO SILENT YOU DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING I AM AT ANY RATE TRYING TO GET YOU TO SEE WHAT SORT OF LIFE IT WAS I LED WITH FLORENCE AND WHAT FLORENCE WAS LIKE WELL SHE WAS BRIGHT AND SHE DANCED
ONE OF THE FOOTMEN WHO HAD STOOPED TO PICK UP SOME BROKEN GLASS REMAINED IN THAT POSITION WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THE WINDOW AND FROM DOLOKHOV'S BACK ANATOLE STOOD ERECT WITH STARING EYES
BUT IN THE MURDERER SUCH A MURDERER AS A POET WILL CONDESCEND TO THERE MUST BE RAGING SOME GREAT STORM OF PASSION JEALOUSY AMBITION VENGEANCE HATRED
AND SHE WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM SO OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO HER THE THINGS PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY'RE IN LOVE HE DRESSED HIMSELF UP IN WOLFSKINS AND WENT UP INTO THE BLACK MOUNTAINS AND THE
AFTER WHICH THERE WAS GENERALLY A DRINKING BOUT FINISHING WITH VISITS OF A KIND PIERRE WAS VERY FOND OF
FIFTY REPLIED THE LATTER ALL RIGHT FIFTY IMPERIALS THAT I WILL DRINK A WHOLE BOTTLE OF RUM WITHOUT TAKING IT FROM MY MOUTH SITTING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW ON THIS SPOT
AND I SHALL GO ON TALKING IN A LOW VOICE WHILE THE SEA SOUNDS IN THE DISTANCE AND OVERHEAD THE GREAT BLACK FLOOD OF WIND POLISHES THE BRIGHT STARS FROM TIME TO TIME WE SHALL GET UP AND GO TO THE DOOR AND LOOK OUT AT THE GREAT MOON AND SAY
SHE WOULD TALK ABOUT WILLIAM THE SILENT ABOUT GUSTAVE THE LOQUACIOUS ABOUT PARIS FROCKS ABOUT HOW THE POOR DRESSED IN THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ABOUT FANTIN LATOUR
WHICH WAS THEN STILL RESIDENTIAL I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAD GONE TO NEW YORK I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAD GONE TO THE TEA I DON'T SEE WHY FLORENCE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THAT SORT OF SPELLING BEE
NOW IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IN THE FIRST OF THESE MURDERS THAT OF THE MARRS THE SAME INCIDENT
SHE SEEMED TO DANCE OVER THE FLOORS OF CASTLES AND OVER SEAS AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER THE SALONS OF MODISTES AND OVER THE PLAGES OF THE RIVIERA LIKE A GAY TREMULOUS BEAM REFLECTED FROM WATER UPON A CEILING
I HAVE HEARD HER LECTURE TEDDY ASHBURNHAM BY THE HOUR ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FRANZ HALS AND A WOUVERMANS AND WHY THE PRE MYCENAEAN STATUES WERE CUBICAL WITH KNOBS ON THE TOP I WONDER WHAT HE MADE OF IT PERHAPS HE WAS THANKFUL
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT WAIT A BIT HE IS NOT DRUNK YET A BOTTLE HERE SAID ANATOLE TAKING A GLASS FROM THE TABLE HE WENT UP TO PIERRE FIRST OF ALL YOU MUST DRINK PIERRE DRANK ONE GLASS AFTER ANOTHER
CARDS AND SUPPER WERE OVER BUT THE VISITORS HAD NOT YET DISPERSED PIERRE THREW OFF HIS CLOAK AND ENTERED THE FIRST ROOM IN WHICH WERE THE REMAINS OF SUPPER A FOOTMAN THINKING NO ONE SAW HIM
AND MADE APPREHENSIBLE BY REACTION NOW APPLY THIS TO THE CASE IN MACBETH HERE AS I HAVE SAID
IT SEEMS ALMOST LUDICROUS TO GUARD AND EXPLAIN MY USE OF A WORD IN A SITUATION WHERE IT WOULD NATURALLY EXPLAIN ITSELF BUT IT HAS BECOME NECESSARY TO DO SO IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNSCHOLARLIKE USE OF THE WORD SYMPATHY
IF THE READER HAS EVER WITNESSED A WIFE DAUGHTER OR SISTER IN A FAINTING FIT
THAT WHICH HE HAS SEEN EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE BUT TO RETURN FROM THIS DIGRESSION MY UNDERSTANDING
BUT IGNOBLE INSTINCT BY WHICH WE CLEAVE TO LIFE AN INSTINCT WHICH AS BEING INDISPENSABLE TO THE PRIMAL LAW OF SELF PRESERVATION
I DIDN'T SEE ANY CALL TO DO IT WHY DOES ONE DO THINGS I JUST DRIFTED IN AND WANTED FLORENCE
OUR SYMPATHY MUST BE WITH HIM OF COURSE I MEAN A SYMPATHY OF COMPREHENSION A SYMPATHY BY WHICH WE ENTER INTO HIS FEELINGS AND ARE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THEM
SOME EIGHT OR NINE YOUNG MEN WERE CROWDING ANXIOUSLY ROUND AN OPEN WINDOW THREE OTHERS WERE ROMPING WITH A YOUNG BEAR ONE PULLING HIM BY THE CHAIN AND TRYING TO SET HIM AT THE OTHERS I BET A HUNDRED ON STEVENS SHOUTED ONE
AND THE MOST TO BE DISTRUSTED AND YET THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE TRUST TO NOTHING ELSE WHICH MAY DO FOR ORDINARY LIFE BUT NOT FOR PHILOSOPHICAL PURPOSES OF THIS OUT OF TEN THOUSAND INSTANCES THAT I MIGHT PRODUCE
DIFFERENT IN DEGREE AMONGST ALL LIVING CREATURES THIS INSTINCT THEREFORE BECAUSE IT ANNIHILATES ALL DISTINCTIONS AND DEGRADES THE GREATEST OF MEN TO THE LEVEL OF THE POOR BEETLE THAT WE TREAD ON
HOW ABOUT THESE WISHING PILLS ENQUIRED THE SCARECROW TAKING THE BOX FROM HIS JACKET POCKET CAN'T WE USE THEM TO ESCAPE NOT UNLESS WE CAN COUNT SEVENTEEN BY TWOS ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN
I WAS PROUD OF MY GREAT SIZE AND REALIZED THAT NOW I COULD SAFELY TRAVEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHILE MY SUPERIOR CULTURE WOULD MAKE ME A FIT ASSOCIATE FOR THE MOST LEARNED PERSON I MIGHT CHANCE TO MEET SO WHILE THE PROFESSOR PICKED THE LITTLE GIRLS
AND THEY FLED SCREAMING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WHEN THE LAST FOE HAD DISAPPEARED TIP CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE SOFAS AND ASSISTED THE WOGGLE BUG TO FOLLOW HIM
SCARECROW BECAME GREATLY ANIMATED AT THIS SIGHT AND EXCLAIMED HOW DELIGHTED I SHALL BE TO SEE MY OLD FRIEND THE TIN WOODMAN AGAIN
THE COWARDLY LION AND THE SCARECROW THE LINES OF THE ENGRAVING BEING TRACED UPON THE SILVER IN YELLOW GOLD ON THE WALLS HUNG SEVERAL PORTRAITS
THE SCHOLARS FOLLOWED AFTER HIM IN A WILD MOB AND I WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SCHOOL ROOM STILL IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE AND FREE TO DO AS I PLEASED IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO ME
IT WAS THROUGH THIS GATEWAY HIS MAJESTY PROPOSED TO ESCAPE AND THE ROYAL ARMY NOW LED THE SAW HORSE ALONG THE PASSAGE
BUT PARDON ME IF I SEEM INQUISITIVE
YOUR MAJESTY THE CITY IS CONQUERED GASPED THE ROYAL ARMY WHO WAS ALL OUT OF BREATH THIS IS QUITE SUDDEN SAID THE SCARECROW BUT PLEASE GO AND BAR ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS OF THE PALACE WHILE I SHOW THIS PUMPKINHEAD HOW TO THROW A QUOIT
GET TO WORK MY DEAR NICK AND FIT THE PUMPKINHEAD'S LEG TO THE SAW HORSE JACK WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THIS IDEA BUT HE SUBMITTED TO HAVING HIS LEFT LEG AMPUTATED BY THE TIN WOODMAN AND WHITTLED DOWN TO FIT THE LEFT LEG OF THE SAW HORSE
THE SOLDIER HASTENED TO DO THIS WHILE TIP WHO HAD ARRIVED AT HIS HEELS REMAINED IN THE COURTYARD TO LOOK AT THE SCARECROW WITH WONDERING EYES HIS MAJESTY CONTINUED TO THROW THE QUOITS
AND WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH THE COURTYARD IN WHICH THEY WERE STANDING WAS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PALACE WHICH SURROUNDED IT ON ALL SIDES BUT IN ONE PLACE A PASSAGE LED TO AN OUTER GATEWAY
THE FLUTTER OF THESE GREAT WINGS FILLED THE JACKDAWS WITH TERROR AND WHEN THE GUMP
SO WHEN THE JACKDAWS NEARLY KNOCKED HIM DOWN IN THEIR RUSH OF WINGS AND THEIR SHARP BEAKS AND CLAWS THREATENED TO DAMAGE HIS BRILLIANT PLATING THE WOODMAN PICKED UP HIS AXE AND MADE IT WHIRL SWIFTLY AROUND HIS HEAD
I MUST HAVE LIVED FULLY THREE YEARS IN THAT SECLUDED SCHOOL HOUSE HEARTH SAID HE DRINKING THIRSTILY OF THE EVER FLOWING FOUNT OF LIMPID KNOWLEDGE BEFORE ME QUITE POETICAL
AND I ACQUIRED IN THIS WAY A FUND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL MYSELF CONFESS IS SIMPLY MARVELOUS THAT IS WHY I PLACE T E THOROUGHLY EDUCATED UPON MY CARDS
WHY THE THREE PILLS ARE IN THE BOX AGAIN SAID THE SCARECROW OF COURSE THEY ARE THE WOGGLE BUG DECLARED
I WILL GET OUT MY FAMOUS MAGNIFYING GLASS AND THROW THE INSECT UPON A SCREEN IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED CONDITION THAT YOU MAY ALL STUDY CAREFULLY ITS PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
TIP DURING THIS CONVERSATION WAS LOOKING AT THE WOODMAN WITH UNDISGUISED AMAZEMENT AND NOTICED THAT THE CELEBRATED EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES WAS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF PIECES OF TIN
KNOWING NO BETTER I USED MY ARMS AS WELL AS MY LEGS FOR WALKING AND CRAWLED UNDER THE EDGES OF STONES OR HID AMONG THE ROOTS OF GRASSES WITH NO THOUGHT BEYOND FINDING A FEW INSECTS SMALLER THAN MYSELF TO FEED UPON
AND THE PAINTED SACK THAT SERVED HIM FOR A HEAD WAS CAREFULLY LAUNDERED AND RESTUFFED WITH THE BRAINS ORIGINALLY GIVEN HIM BY THE GREAT WIZARD HIS CLOTHES WERE ALSO CLEANED AND PRESSED BY THE IMPERIAL TAILORS AND HIS CROWN POLISHED AND AGAIN SEWED UPON HIS HEAD
THEY SURELY DO NOT COMPLAIN OF YOUR WISE AND GRACIOUS RULE NO BUT THEY SAY IT IS A POOR RULE THAT DON'T WORK BOTH WAYS ANSWERED THE SCARECROW AND THESE FEMALES ARE ALSO OF THE OPINION THAT MEN HAVE RULED THE LAND LONG ENOUGH
SUGGESTED TIP I CAN'T SAID THE SCARECROW WHY NOT YOU'VE A MOUTH HAVEN'T YOU ASKED THE BOY YES BUT MY MOUTH IS PAINTED ON AND THERE'S NO SWALLOW CONNECTED WITH IT ANSWERED THE SCARECROW IN FACT HE CONTINUED
WHO WERE MORE FRIGHTENED THAN HURT OFF THE GROUND AND THE PUPILS CLUSTERED AROUND HIM CLOSELY GROUPED I CALMLY WALKED OUT OF THE SCHOOL HOUSE TURNED A CORNER AND ESCAPED UNNOTICED
WE OWE YOU MANY THANKS FOR THE GALLANT FIGHT YOU MADE I REALLY THINK WE HAVE ESCAPED VERY NICELY REMARKED THE TIN WOODMAN IN A TONE OF PRIDE NOT SO EXCLAIMED A HOLLOW VOICE
AND ARE RUNNING THINGS TO SUIT THEMSELVES DEAR ME WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY IDEA CRIED THE EMPEROR WHO WAS BOTH SHOCKED
BUT OUR FRIEND THE WOGGLE BUG CLAIMS TO BE HIGHLY EDUCATED SO HE OUGHT EASILY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT CAN BE DONE IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF EDUCATION
AND AFTERWARD THE LITTLE PARTY RESUMED ITS JOURNEY
THE TIN WOODMAN LOOKED AROUND HIM IN A PUZZLED WAY FOR THE SAW HORSE HAD UNTIL NOW REMAINED QUIETLY STANDING IN A CORNER WHERE THE EMPEROR HAD NOT NOTICED HIM TIP IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE ODD LOOKING CREATURE TO THEM
I RESOLVED TO ESTABLISH MY FUTURE HOME BESIDE IT SO I FOUND A CHARMING NEST BETWEEN TWO BRICKS AND HID MYSELF THEREIN FOR MANY MANY MONTHS
NOT EXACTLY REPLIED THE SCARECROW FOR IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO ME
ARE YOUR SUBJECTS HAPPY AND CONTENTED MY DEAR FRIEND I CANNOT SAY WAS THE REPLY FOR THE GIRLS OF OZ HAVE RISEN IN REVOLT AND DRIVEN ME OUT OF THE EMERALD CITY GREAT GOODNESS CRIED THE TIN WOODMAN WHAT A CALAMITY
ASKED THE WOGGLE BUG LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER WITH UNCONCEALED INTEREST NOT MORE SO THAN YOURSELF ANSWERED THE SCARECROW EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS UNUSUAL UNTIL YOU GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT WHAT RARE PHILOSOPHY
THEN IF ONE FALLS OFF WE WILL ALL FALL OFF AND WHILE THE SOLDIER WAS GONE FOR THE CLOTHESLINE HIS MAJESTY CONTINUED
IT FITS VERY NICELY DOES IT NOT AND THE WOGGLE BUG STOOD UP AND TURNED HIMSELF AROUND SLOWLY
EXCELLENT CRIED THE SCARECROW BRING THE HORSE HERE AT ONCE THE SOLDIER HASTENED AWAY AND PRESENTLY THEY HEARD THE CLATTERING OF THE HORSE'S WOODEN LEGS UPON THE PAVEMENT AS HE WAS LED INTO THE COURTYARD HIS MAJESTY REGARDED THE STEED CRITICALLY
TO THAT OF HIS COMRADE DEAR ME SAID THE SCARECROW DOLEFULLY WHAT A MESS I'M IN NEVER MIND MY FRIEND RETURNED THE TIN WOODMAN I'LL SEND YOU TO MY IMPERIAL LAUNDRY AND YOU'LL COME OUT AS GOOD AS NEW
BUT I WON'T TAKE ANOTHER PILL I PROMISE YOU AND WITH THIS REMARK HE RETIRED SULKILY TO THE BACK OF THE NEST WELL SAID THE WOGGLE BUG IT REMAINS FOR ME TO SAVE US IN MY MOST HIGHLY MAGNIFIED AND THOROUGHLY EDUCATED MANNER FOR I SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONE ABLE AND WILLING TO MAKE A WISH
I BEG YOU TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN YOUR SPEECH SAID THE PUMPKINHEAD SHARPLY REMEMBER IF YOU PLEASE THAT IT IS MY LEG YOU ARE ABUSING I CANNOT FORGET IT RETORTED THE SAW HORSE
DON'T MENTION THAT TO THE TIN WOODMAN EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW EARNESTLY YOU WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS TERRIBLY HE IS A PROUD MAN AS HE HAS EVERY REASON TO BE AND IT PLEASES HIM TO BE TERMED EMPEROR RATHER THAN KING
EXCLAIMED THE WOGGLE BUG ADMIRINGLY YES MY BRAINS ARE WORKING WELL TODAY ADMITTED THE SCARECROW AN ACCENT OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE THEN
HAS LATELY CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE NICKEL PLATED GOOD GRACIOUS THE SCARECROW EXCLAIMED AT HEARING THIS IF HIS WIT BEARS THE SAME POLISH HOW SPARKLING IT MUST BE BUT SHOW US IN
AND THE ENGRAVED OIL CAN I BEGIN TO THINK
PROFESSOR NOWITALL IS DOUBTLESS THE MOST FAMOUS SCHOLAR IN THE LAND OF OZ AND AFTER A FEW DAYS I BEGAN TO LISTEN TO THE LECTURES AND DISCOURSES HE GAVE HIS PUPILS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS MORE ATTENTIVE THAN THE HUMBLE UNNOTICED WOGGLE BUG
HOW LARGE AN ARMY CAN YOU ASSEMBLE WE DO NOT NEED AN ARMY REPLIED THE WOODMAN WE FOUR WITH THE AID OF MY GLEAMING AXE ARE ENOUGH TO STRIKE TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE REBELS WE FIVE CORRECTED THE PUMPKINHEAD FIVE
LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER CRITICALLY I BELIEVE THE BOY AND THE WOGGLE BUG ARE THE ONLY ONES IN OUR PARTY THAT ARE ABLE TO SWALLOW OBSERVING THE TRUTH OF THIS REMARK TIP SAID THEN I WILL UNDERTAKE TO MAKE THE FIRST WISH
SAID HE I HAVE CAPTURED A WOGGLE BUG A VERY RARE AND INTERESTING SPECIMEN DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT A WOGGLE BUG IS NO YELLED THE SCHOLARS IN CHORUS THEN SAID THE PROFESSOR
BUT IN A KINDLY SYMPATHETIC TONE DO NOT I BEG OF YOU DAMPEN TODAY'S SUN WITH THE SHOWERS OF TOMORROW FOR BEFORE YOUR HEAD HAS TIME TO SPOIL YOU CAN HAVE IT CANNED AND IN THAT WAY IT MAY BE PRESERVED INDEFINITELY
NONSENSE EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW THEY'RE TOO BUSY TO COOK EVEN IF THEY KNOW HOW BUT SHOULD I REMAIN HERE A PRISONER FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME PROTESTED JACK I'M LIABLE TO SPOIL
IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE EVEN AS YOU NOW BEHOLD ME THE STUDENTS STOOD UP ON THEIR STOOLS AND CRANED THEIR HEADS FORWARD TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF ME AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS JUMPED UPON THE SILL OF AN OPEN WINDOW WHERE THEY COULD SEE MORE PLAINLY BEHOLD
THEN BRIGHT AND EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THEY SET OUT UPON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THE EMERALD CITY
AS A MATTER OF FACT WE ARE NONE OF US ABOVE CRITICISM SO LET US BEAR WITH EACH OTHERS FAULTS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION SAID THE WOGGLE BUG APPROVINGLY YOU MUST HAVE AN EXCELLENT HEART MY METALLIC FRIEND I HAVE
THIS THE SCARECROW TRIED TO DO BUT HIS PADDED GLOVES WERE TOO CLUMSY TO CLUTCH SO SMALL AN OBJECT AND HE HELD THE BOX TOWARD THE BOY WHILE TIP SELECTED ONE OF THE PILLS AND SWALLOWED IT COUNT CRIED THE SCARECROW
AH THEN YOU WOULD NOT BE FIT TO ASSOCIATE WITH RETURNED THE SCARECROW THE MATTER IS MORE SERIOUS THAN I SUSPECTED YOU SAID THE PUMPKINHEAD GLOOMILY
NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR WAS THE REPLY ALTHOUGH IT IS MY INTENTION SOON TO VISIT THE EMERALD CITY
FOR SHE NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL WHY NOT START COUNTING AT A HALF OF ONE ASKED THE SAW HORSE ABRUPTLY THEN ANYONE CAN COUNT UP TO SEVENTEEN BY TWOS VERY EASILY THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SURPRISE FOR THE SAW HORSE WAS CONSIDERED
THE INVADING ARMY ENTERED THE CITY MORE SLOWLY FOR THEY STOPPED TO DIG EMERALDS OUT OF THE WALLS AND PAVING STONES WITH THE POINTS OF THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES SO THE SOLDIER AND THE BOY REACHED THE PALACE BEFORE THE NEWS HAD SPREAD THAT THE CITY WAS CONQUERED
AS COOLLY AS IF NO DANGER THREATENED HIS THRONE BUT THE PUMPKINHEAD HAVING CAUGHT SIGHT OF TIP AMBLED TOWARD THE BOY AS FAST AS HIS WOODEN LEGS WOULD GO GOOD AFTERNOON NOBLE PARENT HE CRIED DELIGHTEDLY
YES ANSWERED THE TIN WOODMAN BUT OUR FRIEND'S CLOTHES ARE USELESS WITHOUT STUFFING WHY NOT STUFF HIM WITH MONEY
OTHERS RAN SCREAMING OUT OF THE WAY AND ONLY ONE OR TWO JABBED THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES FRANTICALLY AT THE ESCAPING PRISONERS
AND WITHOUT A PAUSE THE WOODEN STEED GAVE ONE FINAL LEAP AND LAUNCHED THEM ALL IN MID AIR A SECOND LATER THEY WERE ROLLING SPLASHING AND BOBBING ABOUT IN THE WATER
AND IT WAS THE MORE NECESSARY BECAUSE I HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT SCRATCHED DURING MY ADVENTUROUS EXPERIENCES YOU WILL OBSERVE THIS ENGRAVED STAR UPON MY LEFT BREAST IT NOT ONLY INDICATES WHERE MY EXCELLENT HEART LIES BUT
IN ACT OF PRESENTING THE TIN WOODMAN WITH A HEART COVERED ALMOST ONE ENTIRE END OF THE ROOM WHILE THE VISITORS GAZED AT THESE THINGS IN SILENT ADMIRATION THEY SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD VOICE IN THE NEXT ROOM EXCLAIM
I'M SURE THE EMPEROR WILL RECEIVE US EVEN IN HIS PRESENT STATE THE EMPEROR'S STATE IS ALWAYS MAGNIFICENT SAID THE MAN
SO HE BEGGED HIS FRIENDS TO EXCUSE HIM WHILE HE RETIRED TO HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT AND ALLOWED HIS SERVANTS TO POLISH HIM THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN A SHORT TIME AND WHEN THE EMPEROR RETURNED HIS NICKEL PLATED BODY SHONE SO MAGNIFICENTLY
SAID THE TIN WOODMAN TAKING UP THE SCARECROW'S HEAD AND CARESSING IT TENDERLY
CRIED TO THE TIN WOODMAN TO SAVE HIM AND THAT GOOD FRIEND RESPONDED WITH RENEWED ENERGY HIS AXE FAIRLY FLASHED AMONG THE JACKDAWS AND FORTUNATELY THE GUMP BEGAN WILDLY WAVING THE TWO WINGS REMAINING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF ITS BODY
REPLIED THE SOLDIER STILL PALE WITH FEAR BUT WHERE WAS MY STANDING ARMY AT THE TIME INQUIRED HIS MAJESTY LOOKING AT THE SOLDIER GRAVELY YOUR STANDING ARMY WAS RUNNING ANSWERED THE FELLOW HONESTLY
CAUGHT UP INTO KNOTS AND FASTENED WITH TINY SILVER AXES UPON A HANDSOME CENTER TABLE STOOD A LARGE SILVER OIL CAN RICHLY ENGRAVED WITH SCENES FROM THE PAST ADVENTURES OF THE TIN WOODMAN DOROTHY
FOR ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS PERCHED UPON THE WINDOW SILL GAVE A SCREAM AND FELL BACKWARD OUT THE WINDOW DRAWING HER COMPANION WITH HER AS SHE DISAPPEARED THE PROFESSOR UTTERED A CRY OF HORROR AND RUSHED AWAY THROUGH THE DOOR TO SEE IF THE POOR CHILDREN WERE INJURED BY THE FALL
IT IS NO MORE DANGEROUS TO FACE THOSE RECKLESS GIRLS THAN TO RIDE THIS FIERY UNTAMED WOODEN HORSE PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT OBSERVED HIS MAJESTY BUT FOR MY PART NOT BEING A SOLDIER I AM FOND OF DANGER
TAILORS HAVING LIKE CATS NINE LIVES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE FELLOW WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL FOR HAD HE LOST THAT NINTH LIFE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM SO HE BEGGED PERMISSION TO FURNISH ME WITH THE STYLISH COSTUME I NOW WEAR
BUT THE GUMP'S EYES WERE OF GLASS AND COULD NOT BE INJURED
ADDED THE SCARECROW YOUR MATHEMATICS SEEM TO ME VERY LIKE A BOTTLE OF MIXED PICKLES THE MORE YOU FISH FOR WHAT YOU WANT THE LESS CHANCE YOU HAVE OF GETTING IT I AM CERTAIN THAT IF THE THING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AT ALL IT IS IN A VERY SIMPLE MANNER
SO THE SAW HORSE CONTINUED HIS WILD CAREER UNCHECKED AND WITH UNABATED SPEED PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO THE BANKS OF A WIDE RIVER
THE SCARECROW AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD WERE STILL PLAYING AT QUOITS IN THE COURTYARD WHEN THE GAME WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE ABRUPT ENTRANCE OF THE ROYAL ARMY OF OZ WHO CAME FLYING IN WITHOUT HIS HAT OR GUN
NOW MY BOY YOU MUST MOUNT FIRST AND PLEASE SIT AS CLOSE TO THE HORSE'S NECK AS POSSIBLE TIP CLIMBED QUICKLY TO HIS PLACE AND THE SOLDIER AND THE SCARECROW MANAGED TO HOIST THE PUMPKINHEAD TO A SEAT JUST BEHIND HIM
THAT MAY BE BUT THE PILL GAVE ME A DREADFUL PAIN JUST THE SAME
THAT THE SCARECROW HEARTILY CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS IMPROVED APPEARANCE THAT NICKEL PLATE WAS I CONFESS A HAPPY THOUGHT SAID NICK
RETURNED NICK WELL PLEASED MY HEART IS QUITE THE BEST PART OF ME BUT NOW LET US START UPON OUR JOURNEY THEY PERCHED THE ONE LEGGED PUMPKINHEAD UPON THE SAW HORSE AND TIED HIM TO HIS SEAT WITH CORDS
UNTIL THEY DREW UP BESIDE THE PALACE STEPS AN AGED WINKIE DRESSED IN A UNIFORM OF SILVER CLOTH CAME FORWARD TO ASSIST THEM TO ALIGHT SAID THE SCARECROW TO HIS PERSONAGE SHOW US AT ONCE TO YOUR MASTER THE EMPEROR
AND TIP'S SUGGESTION WAS WITH THE SCARECROW'S CONSENT QUICKLY ACTED UPON THEY SELECTED ALL THE NEWEST AND CLEANEST BILLS AND ASSORTED THEM INTO VARIOUS PILES THE SCARECROW'S LEFT LEG AND BOOT WERE STUFFED WITH FIVE DOLLAR BILLS
THAT INSECTS WORE CLOTHES NOR DO THEY IN THEIR NATURAL STATE RETURNED THE STRANGER BUT IN THE COURSE OF MY WANDERINGS I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SAVE THE NINTH LIFE OF A TAILOR
BUT TELL ME HOW CAME YOUR MAJESTY HERE AND WHO ARE YOUR COMPANIONS THE SCARECROW WITH GREAT POLITENESS INTRODUCED TIP AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE LATTER PERSONAGE SEEMED TO INTEREST THE TIN WOODMAN GREATLY
TO ACCEPT YOUR KIND INVITATION FOR NOWHERE IN THE LAND OF OZ COULD I HOPE TO MEET WITH SO CONGENIAL A COMPANY THAT IS TRUE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PUMPKINHEAD WE ARE QUITE AS CONGENIAL AS FLIES AND HONEY
THE SCARECROW PLANS AN ESCAPE TIP SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE GIRLS AND FOLLOWED SWIFTLY AFTER THE SOLDIER WITH THE GREEN WHISKERS
HE DOESN'T SEEM ESPECIALLY GRACEFUL HE REMARKED MUSINGLY BUT I SUPPOSE HE CAN RUN HE CAN INDEED SAID TIP GAZING UPON THE SAW HORSE ADMIRINGLY
BUT ALTHOUGH MANY WERE BEATEN OFF IN THIS WAY THE BIRDS WERE SO NUMEROUS AND SO BRAVE THAT THEY CONTINUED THE ATTACK AS FURIOUSLY AS BEFORE SOME OF THEM PECKED AT THE EYES OF THE GUMP WHICH HUNG OVER THE NEST IN A HELPLESS CONDITION
REPEATED THE TIN WOODMAN YES
OBJECTED TIP NO BUT HE MAY BE INDUCED TO CARRY THREE SAID HIS MAJESTY I SHALL THEREFORE LEAVE MY ROYAL ARMY BEHIND FOR FROM THE EASE WITH WHICH HE WAS CONQUERED
WHICH SMARTED FOR AN HOUR AFTERWARD BUT THE NEEDLES HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE SCARECROW OR JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHO NEVER EVEN SUSPECTED THEY WERE BEING PRODDED AS FOR THE SAW HORSE HE MADE A WONDERFUL RECORD UPSETTING A FRUIT CART
COVERING TIP AND THE WOGGLE BUG AND JACK'S PUMPKIN HEAD AND BEGAN TEARING IT AWAY AND FLYING OFF WITH IT ONLY TO LET IT DROP STRAW BY STRAW INTO THE GREAT GULF BENEATH THE SCARECROW'S HEAD NOTING WITH DISMAY THIS WANTON DESTRUCTION OF HIS INTERIOR
KEEP QUIET COMMANDED TIP STERNLY VERY WELL DEAR FATHER ANSWERED THE OBEDIENT JACK THE WOGGLE BUG LISTENED PATIENTLY EVEN RESPECTFULLY TO THESE REMARKS AND THEN RESUMED HIS STORY
I EXPECTED THIS BLOW SAID THE SOLDIER SULKILY BUT I CAN BEAR IT I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF BY CUTTING OFF MY LOVELY GREEN WHISKERS AND AFTER ALL
ARE LIABLE TO LIVE FOR MANY YEARS MY LIFE IS NECESSARILY SHORT SO I MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEW DAYS THAT REMAIN TO ME THERE THERE DON'T WORRY ANSWERED THE SCARECROW SOOTHINGLY
THEN I AM REALLY IN DANGER DECLARED HIS MAJESTY POSITIVELY AND IT WILL BE WISE FOR ME TO CONSIDER A MEANS TO ESCAPE
IF YOU'LL KEEP QUIET LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO THINK I'LL TRY TO FIND SOME WAY FOR US ALL TO ESCAPE
THE SAW HORSE ANSWERED FOR HIMSELF BUT I SEEM TO LEARN VERY QUICKLY AND OFTEN IT OCCURS TO ME THAT I KNOW MORE THAN ANY OF THOSE AROUND ME PERHAPS YOU DO SAID THE EMPEROR FOR EXPERIENCE DOES NOT ALWAYS MEAN WISDOM
OVERTURNING SEVERAL MEEK LOOKING MEN AND FINALLY BOWLING OVER THE NEW GUARDIAN OF THE GATE A FUSSY LITTLE FAT WOMAN APPOINTED BY GENERAL JINJUR NOR DID THE IMPETUOUS CHARGER STOP THEN
AND I SUPPOSE HE IS NOW MORE PROUD THAN EVER OF HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE IS INDEED SAID THE MAN WITH A POLITE BOW
NOR WAS THE SAW HORSE ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE OPERATION EITHER FOR HE GROWLED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT BEING BUTCHERED AS HE CALLED IT AND AFTERWARD DECLARED THAT THE NEW LEG WAS A DISGRACE TO A RESPECTABLE SAW HORSE
BUT THAT ANIMAL BEING STILL UPON HIS BACK KICKED OUT SO VICIOUSLY WITH HIS WOODEN LEGS
THE FACE OF THE SCARECROW AND MANY PORTIONS OF HIS BODY BORE GREAT BLOTCHES OF PUTZ POMADE FOR THE TIN WOODMAN IN HIS EAGERNESS TO WELCOME HIS FRIEND HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE CONDITION OF HIS TOILET AND HAD RUBBED THE THICK COATING OF PASTE FROM HIS OWN BODY
THEY COULD USE YOU FOR SEED THE SOLDIER NOW RETURNED WITH A LONG LINE AND TIED ALL THREE FIRMLY TOGETHER ALSO LASHING THEM TO THE BODY OF THE SAW HORSE SO THERE SEEMED LITTLE DANGER OF THEIR TUMBLING OFF NOW THROW OPEN THE GATES COMMANDED THE SCARECROW
THE CHILL NIGHTS RENDERED ME STIFF AND MOTIONLESS FOR I WORE NO CLOTHING BUT EACH MORNING THE WARM RAYS OF THE SUN GAVE ME NEW LIFE AND RESTORED ME TO ACTIVITY
CRIED THE PROFESSOR IN A LOUD VOICE THIS HIGHLY MAGNIFIED WOGGLE BUG
IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE I COULD THINK OF YOUR MAJESTY ADDED THE SOLDIER FEARING HE HAD MADE A BLUNDER IT PLEASES ME VERY MUCH SAID THE SCARECROW HAS THE ANIMAL BEEN FED
WHY NOT USE ONE OF HIS LEGS TO MAKE A LEG FOR THE HORSE THAT CARRIES HIM I JUDGE THAT BOTH ARE MADE OF WOOD NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL REAL CLEVERNESS SAID THE SCARECROW APPROVINGLY I WONDER MY BRAINS DID NOT THINK OF THAT LONG AGO
AT THIS THEY ALL TURNED IN SURPRISE TO LOOK AT THE SCARECROW'S HEAD WHICH LAY AT THE BACK OF THE NEST I AM COMPLETELY RUINED DECLARED THE SCARECROW AS HE NOTED THEIR ASTONISHMENT
FOR NO MAN COULD FACE THE TERRIBLE WEAPONS OF THE INVADERS WELL SAID THE SCARECROW AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
AND HIS MAJESTY HAS BEEN VERY KIND INDEED TO ME
I'M SURE IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME REPLIED THE BOY THE SAW HORSE NOW AMBLED FORWARD AT A PACE SO FAST THAT ITS RIDERS HAD HARD WORK TO STICK UPON ITS BACK SO THERE WAS LITTLE FURTHER CONVERSATION
HE RATTLED AND CLANKED A LITTLE AS HE MOVED BUT IN THE MAIN HE SEEMED TO BE MOST CLEVERLY CONSTRUCTED AND HIS APPEARANCE WAS ONLY MARRED BY THE THICK COATING OF POLISHING PASTE THAT COVERED HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT
YES SAID TIP
ENTREATED THE TIN WOODMAN TEARS OF SYMPATHY RUNNING DOWN HIS NICKEL CHEEKS I I DON'T KNOW
IT IS TOO LATE TO ESCAPE THEY WOULD SOON TEAR YOU TO PIECES THE SCARECROW SIGHED IN AN EMERGENCY HE ANNOUNCED IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO PAUSE AND REFLECT
DOCTOR NIKIDIK'S FAMOUS WISHING PILLS THE TIN WOODMAN WAS USUALLY A PEACEFUL MAN BUT WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD FIGHT AS FIERCELY AS A ROMAN GLADIATOR
YOU MUST REMEMBER IT IS THE REGULAR ORDAINED EXISTENCE OF WOGGLE BUGS
THEN AT ONCE THE PAIN STOPPED AND THE BOY ROSE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND FOUND THE SCARECROW LOOKING WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE END OF THE PEPPER BOX WHAT'S HAPPENED ASKED THE BOY A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HIS RECENT EXHIBITION
THERE REMAINED SO LITTLE SPACE FOR THE KING THAT HE WAS LIABLE TO FALL OFF AS SOON AS THE HORSE STARTED FETCH A CLOTHESLINE SAID THE KING TO HIS ARMY AND TIE US ALL TOGETHER
THE MOST STUPID OF THE ENTIRE PARTY YOU MAKE ME QUITE ASHAMED OF MYSELF SAID THE SCARECROW BOWING LOW TO THE SAW HORSE NEVERTHELESS THE CREATURE IS RIGHT DECLARED THE WOGGLE BUG
AND THIS CROWN IS SO HEAVY THAT IT MAKES MY HEAD ACHE BUT I HOPE THE CONQUERORS HAVE NO INTENTION OF INJURING ME JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE THE KING I HEARD THEM SAY REMARKED TIP WITH SOME HESITATION THAT THEY
BUT TIME IS PRECIOUS JUST NOW SO LET US QUICKLY MAKE PREPARATIONS TO START UPON OUR JOURNEY THE EMPEROR CALLED HIS LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR AND INSTRUCTED HIM HOW TO RUN THE KINGDOM DURING HIS ABSENCE MEANWHILE THE SCARECROW WAS TAKEN APART
A NICKEL PLATED EMPEROR TIP AWOKE SOON AFTER DAWN BUT THE SCARECROW HAD ALREADY RISEN AND PLUCKED WITH HIS CLUMSY FINGERS A DOUBLE HANDFUL OF RIPE BERRIES FROM SOME BUSHES NEAR BY
AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE FACED THEM WITH A MORE CHEERFUL EXPRESSION UPON HIS PAINTED FACE WHERE IS THE SAW HORSE YOU RODE HERE HE ASKED THE PUMPKINHEAD
LET US BEND OUR STEPS TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY
TO ME SAID THE SAW HORSE A GOOD LEG IS MORE DESIRABLE THAN EITHER
I DID IT TO SAVE MY FRIENDS RETURNED THE HEAD AND I AM GLAD THAT I PERISHED IN SO NOBLE AND UNSELFISH A MANNER BUT WHY ARE YOU ALL SO DESPONDENT INQUIRED THE WOGGLE BUG THE SCARECROW'S CLOTHING IS STILL SAFE
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU ARE HERE THAT TERRIBLE SAW HORSE RAN AWAY WITH ME I SUSPECTED IT SAID TIP DID YOU GET HURT ARE YOU CRACKED AT ALL
I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN HIS POWERS STILL HE CAN RUN
TO THINK VERY LIGHTLY OF THE BLOODSHED AND DEVASTATION INSEPARABLE FROM GREAT MARTIAL EXPLOITS AND THE HEART OF WILLIAM WAS STEELED NOT ONLY BY PROFESSIONAL INSENSIBILITY BUT BY THAT STERNER INSENSIBILITY
THOUGH HE WAS AS YET IN CONFINEMENT ONLY FOR DEBT HE WAS PUT INTO IRONS BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE KING'S BENCH PRISON AND EVEN SO HE WAS WITH DIFFICULTY KEPT IN SAFE CUSTODY THE MASTIFF THAT GUARDED HIS DOOR WAS POISONED
AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO OBTAIN THE QUEEN'S INTERCESSION BUT SHE INDIGNANTLY REFUSED TO SAY A WORD IN FAVOUR OF SUCH A WRETCH AFTER AN INTERVAL OF ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS OATES WAS AGAIN BROUGHT OUT OF HIS DUNGEON HE WAS UNABLE TO STAND
FOR THE CONSUMMATE HYPOCRITE IS NOT HE WHO CONCEALS VICE BEHIND THE SEMBLANCE OF VIRTUE BUT HE WHO MAKES THE VICE WHICH HE HAS NO OBJECTION TO SHOW A STALKING HORSE TO COVER DARKER AND MORE PROFITABLE VICE
THAT HE OWED IT TO HIS RELIGION AND TO THE DIGNITY OF HIS CROWN TO STAND FIRM AGAINST THE OUTCRY OF HERETICAL DEMAGOGUES AND TO LET THE PARLIAMENT SEE FROM THE FIRST THAT HE WOULD BE MASTER IN SPITE OF OPPOSITION
HIS SKILL IN MARITIME AFFAIRS RECOMMENDED HIM TO JAMES WHO HAD DURING MANY YEARS PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS OF THE ADMIRALTY AND UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS AS WELL AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING
WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF A SENSE OF DUTY THREE GREAT COALITIONS THREE LONG AND BLOODY WARS IN WHICH ALL EUROPE FROM THE VISTULA TO THE WESTERN OCEAN WAS IN ARMS ARE TO BE ASCRIBED TO HIS UNCONQUERABLE ENERGY
SET HIM DOWN FOR THE WILDEST OF LIBERTINES THE MULTITUDE WAS UNABLE TO CONCEIVE THAT A MAN WHO EVEN WHEN SOBER WAS MORE FURIOUS AND BOASTFUL THAN OTHERS WHEN THEY WERE DRUNK
TO BE LED ROUND WESTMINSTER HALL WITH AN INSCRIPTION DECLARING HIS INFAMY OVER HIS HEAD TO BE PILLORIED AGAIN IN FRONT OF THE ROYAL EXCHANGE TO BE WHIPPED FROM ALDGATE TO NEWGATE AND AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO DAYS
AND WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THESE WORDS BY THE COUNT OF AVAUX POSITIVELY REFUSED EITHER TO RETRACT THEM OR TO EXPLAIN THEM AWAY
A TIME HAD ARRIVED AT WHICH IT WAS IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THERE SHOULD BE ENTIRE CONCORD BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS TILL AFTER THE SUPPRESSION OF THE WESTERN INSURRECTION GRAVE CAUSES OF DISSENSION HAD SEPARATED WILLIAM
TO REGIONS SOUTH OF THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN SUCH WAS THE PROSPECT WHICH LAY BEFORE WILLIAM WHEN FIRST HE ENTERED ON PUBLIC LIFE AND WHICH NEVER CEASED TO HAUNT HIM TILL HIS LATEST DAY THE FRENCH MONARCHY
TO PAINS SO EXCRUCIATING THAT THEY WITH UNFEIGNED EARNESTNESS BEGGED TO BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL ON CAPITAL CHARGES AND SENT TO THE GALLOWS HAPPILY THE PROGRESS OF THIS GREAT EVIL WAS SPEEDILY STOPPED BY THE REVOLUTION
BUT ONE OF THE PECULIARITIES OF JAMES'S CHARACTER WAS THAT NO ACT HOWEVER WICKED AND SHAMEFUL WHICH HAD BEEN PROMPTED BY A DESIRE TO GAIN HIS FAVOUR EVER SEEMED TO HIM DESERVING OF DISAPPROBATION
WHICH ELAPSED BETWEEN THE DEATH OF CHARLES AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE VICEROYALTY OF CLARENDON WHEN THE NEW LORD LIEUTENANT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE LONDON FOR DUBLIN THE GENERAL WAS SUMMONED FROM DUBLIN TO LONDON DICK TALBOT
AND HIS ACCENT WAS THAT OF HIS NATIVE GASCONY BUT HIS STRONG SENSE HIS KEEN PENETRATION AND HIS LIVELY WIT EMINENTLY QUALIFIED HIM FOR HIS POST
EVEN IN THE MOST ATROCIOUS CASES ILL BECOMES THE JUDICIAL CHARACTER HE BETRAYED HOWEVER NO SIGN OF FEAR OR OF SHAME AND FACED THE STORM OF INVECTIVE WHICH BURST UPON HIM FROM BAR BENCH AND WITNESS BOX
REPRESENTED FRANCE AND WHO TO VIRTUES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS EMINENTLY FRENCH JOINED IN LARGE MEASURE THAT UNQUIET UNSCRUPULOUS AND VAINGLORIOUS AMBITION WHICH HAS REPEATEDLY DRAWN ON FRANCE THE RESENTMENT OF EUROPE
NOT TO COUNTENANCE THIS BAD MAN WHO HAD NOTHING TO RECOMMEND HIM EXCEPT HIS FINE PERSON AND HIS TASTE IN DRESS TALBOT WAS NOT ONLY WELCOME AT THE PALACE WHEN THE BOTTLE OR THE DICEBOX WAS GOING ROUND
SWORE AT THE COOKS AND POSTILIONS AND ALMOST RAISED MOBS BY HIS INSOLENT RODOMONTADES THE REFORMATION HE TOLD THE PEOPLE HAD RUINED EVERYTHING BUT FINE TIMES WERE COMING
HAD LONG BEEN WELL KNOWN ON THE ROAD WHICH HE HAD NOW TO TRAVEL BETWEEN CHESTER AND THE CAPITAL THERE WAS NOT AN INN WHERE HE HAD NOT BEEN IN A BRAWL WHEREVER HE CAME HE PRESSED HORSES IN DEFIANCE OF LAW
THAT IF THEY DESIRED PEACE THEY MUST RESIGN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND DO ANNUAL HOMAGE TO THE HOUSE OF BOURBON THE INJURED NATION DRIVEN TO DESPAIR HAD OPENED ITS DYKES
BOTH FROM WHIGS AND TORIES HE HAD SEEN WITH DISPLEASURE THE ATTEMPTS OF THE WHIGS TO STRIP THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT OF SOME POWERS WHICH HE THOUGHT NECESSARY TO ITS EFFICIENCY AND DIGNITY
THEY LOOKED DOWN ON THE PROTESTANT CHURCHES OF THE CONTINENT AND REGARDED EVERY LINE OF THEIR OWN LITURGY AND RUBRIC AS SCARCELY LESS SACRED THAN THE GOSPELS HIS OPINIONS TOUCHING THE METAPHYSICS OF THEOLOGY WERE CALVINISTIC
BY LAYING THE BLAME OF THE ACCIDENT ON HER MONKEY THESE STORIES WHICH IF THEY HAD BEEN TRUE WOULD NEVER HAVE PASSED THE LIPS OF ANY BUT THE BASEST OF MANKIND WERE PURE INVENTIONS TALBOT WAS SOON FORCED TO OWN THAT THEY WERE SO
HENRY JERMYN WHOM JAMES HAD LATELY CREATED A PEER BY THE TITLE OF LORD DOVER JERMYN HAD BEEN DISTINGUISHED MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS BEFORE BY HIS VAGRANT AMOURS AND HIS DESPERATE DUELS HE WAS NOW RUINED BY PLAY
FOR HE NEVER BECAME AN ENGLISHMAN HE SAVED ENGLAND IT IS TRUE BUT HE NEVER LOVED HER AND HE NEVER OBTAINED HER LOVE TO HIM SHE WAS ALWAYS A LAND OF EXILE VISITED WITH RELUCTANCE AND QUITTED WITH DELIGHT
AND FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE THEOLOGY OF GENEVA THE ENEMIES DID NOT LONG OBSERVE THOSE COURTESIES WHICH MEN OF THEIR RANK EVEN WHEN OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER AT THE HEAD OF ARMIES SELDOM NEGLECT WILLIAM INDEED
HE HAD A GREAT WORK TO DO AND TILL IT WAS DONE NOTHING COULD HARM HIM THEREFORE IT WAS THAT
MERCILESS FLOGGING SOON BECAME AN ORDINARY PUNISHMENT FOR POLITICAL MISDEMEANOURS OF NO VERY AGGRAVATED KIND
AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO DRAG HIM TO TYBURN ON A SLEDGE
PRESENTED A REMARKABLE CONTRAST TO WILLIAM SIMPLE IN TASTES UNGRACIOUS IN DEMEANOUR INDEFATIGABLE AND INTREPID IN WAR REGARDLESS OF ALL THE ORNAMENTAL BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE
THEY CONVERSED EVERY DAY LONG AND FREELY ABOUT THE STATE OF THE SHIPPING AND THE DOCK YARDS THE RESULT OF THIS INTIMACY WAS AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT THE KEEN AND VIGILANT FRENCHMAN
ONE OF THESE WAS ROGER PALMER EARL OF CASTELMAINE IN IRELAND AND HUSBAND OF THE DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND HIS TITLE HAD NOTORIOUSLY BEEN PURCHASED BY HIS WIFE'S DISHONOUR AND HIS OWN HIS FORTUNE WAS SMALL HIS TEMPER
THIS RECKLESS FACTION WAS STRENGTHENED BY AN IMPORTANT REINFORCEMENT RICHARD TALBOT EARL OF TYRCONNEL THE FIERCEST AND MOST UNCOMPROMISING OF ALL THOSE WHO HATED THE LIBERTIES AND RELIGION OF ENGLAND ARRIVED AT COURT FROM DUBLIN
HAPPILY FOR HIM HE WAS NOT PUT TO THE BAR TILL THE FIRST BURST OF POPULAR RAGE HAD SPENT ITSELF AND TILL THE CREDIT OF THE FALSE WITNESSES HAD BEEN BLOWN UPON HE HAD THEREFORE ESCAPED
HE RECOVERED FROM MALADIES WHICH SEEMED HOPELESS THAT BANDS OF ASSASSINS CONSPIRED IN VAIN AGAINST HIS LIFE THAT THE OPEN SKIFF TO WHICH HE TRUSTED HIMSELF ON A STARLESS NIGHT ON A RAGING OCEAN AND NEAR A TREACHEROUS SHORE
CONCEIVED A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR THE KING'S ABILITIES AND CHARACTER THE WORLD HE SAID HAD MUCH OVERRATED HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY WHO HAD LESS CAPACITY THAN CHARLES
AND DOCKYARDS AND HE WAS TO MAKE SOME OVERTURES TO THE HUGUENOT REFUGEES WHO IT WAS SUPPOSED
WHEN IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE STATES GENERAL EXHAUSTED AND DISHEARTENED WERE DESIRIOUS OF REPOSE HIS VOICE WAS STILL AGAINST SHEATHING THE SWORD IF PEACE WAS MADE IT WAS MADE ONLY BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BREATHE INTO OTHER MEN
WHO WAS THE SERVANT OF A CONFEDERACY OF TRADING TOWNS AND TO EVERY MARK OF CONTEMPT THE DAUNTLESS STADTHOLDER REPLIED BY A FRESH DEFIANCE WILLIAM TOOK HIS TITLE
BUT WAS HEARD WITH ATTENTION ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS HE AFFECTED THE CHARACTER OF AN IRISH PATRIOT AND PLEADED WITH GREAT AUDACITY AND SOMETIMES WITH SUCCESS THE CAUSE OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHOSE ESTATES HAD BEEN CONFISCATED HE TOOK CARE HOWEVER
THE PROLONGED MENTAL AGONY OF THE SUFFERER THE SHAME AND MISERY OF ALL CONNECTED WITH HIM THE STAIN ABIDING EVEN TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION ARE THINGS FAR MORE DREADFUL THAN DEATH ITSELF IN GENERAL IT MAY BE SAFELY AFFIRMED
EVEN WHILE THE PRAYER FOR THE DEPARTING WAS READ AT HIS BEDSIDE THAT FEELING WAS ENMITY TO FRANCE AND TO THE MAGNIFICENT KING WHO IN MORE THAN ONE SENSE
WERE NOW AS ANXIOUS TO SUPPORT ROCHESTER AS THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN TO SUPPORT HALIFAX ALL THE INFLUENCE OF BARILLON WAS EMPLOYED ON THE OTHER SIDE AND BARILLON WAS ASSISTED BY ANOTHER FRENCH AGENT
INTO WHICH MAN CAN ENTER WITH HIS FELLOW MEN AND OF MAKING INSTITUTIONS TO WHICH IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD LOOK WITH RESPECT AND CONFIDENCE INSTRUMENTS OF FRIGHTFUL WRONG AND OBJECTS OF GENERAL DISTRUST
AND WHICH HAD TAKEN PART WITH THE CELTS IN THE REBELLION OF SIXTEEN FORTY ONE IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST NOTED SHARPERS AND BULLIES OF LONDON HE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO CHARLES AND JAMES WHEN THEY WERE EXILES IN FLANDERS
HE LOOKED ROUND FOR SUCCOUR AND LOOKED IN VAIN SPAIN WAS UNNERVED GERMANY DISTRACTED ENGLAND CORRUPTED NOTHING SEEMED LEFT TO THE YOUNG STADTHOLDER BUT TO PERISH SWORD IN HAND
BUT WITHOUT FEELING A STRONG PREDILECTION FOR EITHER SIDE NOR IN TRUTH DID HE EVER TO THE END OF HIS LIFE BECOME EITHER A WHIG OR A TORY HE WANTED THAT WHICH IS THE COMMON GROUNDWORK OF BOTH CHARACTERS
WERE CHIEFLY WITH THE OPPOSITE FACTION THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THEY SOMETIMES SAW THE SAME EVENT IN DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW
TALBOT CONTINUED TO FREQUENT THE COURT APPEARED DAILY WITH BRAZEN FRONT BEFORE THE PRINCESS WHOSE RUIN HE HAD PLOTTED AND WAS INSTALLED INTO THE LUCRATIVE POST OF CHIEF PANDAR TO HER HUSBAND IN NO LONG TIME
IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THE SENTIMENT WHICH GRADUALLY POSSESSED ITSELF OF WILLIAM'S WHOLE SOUL WHEN HE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A BOY HIS COUNTRY HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY LEWIS IN OSTENTATIOUS DEFIANCE OF JUSTICE AND PUBLIC LAW
A PERSON WHO COUNTED THE STRIPES ON THE SECOND DAY SAID THAT THEY WERE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED THE BAD MAN ESCAPED WITH LIFE BUT SO NARROWLY THAT HIS IGNORANT AND BIGOTED ADMIRERS THOUGHT HIS RECOVERY MIRACULOUS
TO BE WELL PAID FOR HIS SERVICES AND SUCCEEDED IN ACQUIRING PARTLY BY THE SALE OF HIS INFLUENCE PARTLY BY GAMBLING AND PARTLY BY PIMPING AN ESTATE OF THREE THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FOR UNDER AN OUTWARD SHOW OF LEVITY PROFUSION
SECURE OF PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT HE MIGHT NOW INDULGE IN THE LUXURY OF REVENGE HIS NATURE WAS NOT PLACABLE AND WHILE STILL A SUBJECT HE HAD SUFFERED SOME INJURIES AND INDIGNITIES
AND THEN TO PLACE IT ON THE HEAD OF A BASTARD AND IMPOSTOR AT THE SAME TIME THE PRINCE'S RELIGIOUS SYSTEM DIFFERED WIDELY FROM THAT WHICH WAS THE BADGE OF THE TORIES THEY WERE ARMINIANS AND PRELATISTS
IT WAS HIS CONSOLATION TO CREATE ROUND HIM BY BUILDING PLANTING AND DIGGING A SCENE WHICH MIGHT REMIND HIM OF THE FORMAL PILES OF RED BRICK OF THE LONG CANALS AND OF THE SYMMETRICAL FLOWER BEDS AMIDST WHICH HIS EARLY LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED
AND THE LOUD WEEPING OF ANCIENT SENATORS WHO COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF SURVIVING THE FREEDOM AND GLORY OF THEIR NATIVE LAND THAT WILLIAM HAD BEEN CALLED TO THE HEAD OF AFFAIRS FOR A TIME IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT RESISTANCE WAS HOPELESS
HIS LEGS UNEVEN THE VULGAR SAID AS THOSE OF A BADGER HIS FOREHEAD LOW AS THAT OF A BABOON HIS PURPLE CHEEKS AND HIS MONSTROUS LENGTH OF CHIN HAD BEEN FAMILIAR TO ALL WHO FREQUENTED THE COURTS OF LAW HE HAD THEN BEEN THE IDOL OF THE NATION
OCCUPIED ORANGE DISMANTLED THE FORTIFICATIONS AND CONFISCATED THE REVENUES WILLIAM DECLARED ALOUD AT HIS TABLE BEFORE MANY PERSONS THAT HE WOULD MAKE THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING REPENT THE OUTRAGE
AND WAS EAGER TO RETRIEVE HIS FALLEN FORTUNES BY MEANS OF LUCRATIVE POSTS
HIS ARMS FOLDED AND HIS HAT PULLED OVER HIS EYES IT WAS NOT IN ENGLAND ALONE THAT THESE EVENTS EXCITED STRONG INTEREST MILLIONS OF ROMAN CATHOLICS WHO KNEW NOTHING OF OUR INSTITUTIONS OR OF OUR FACTIONS
WHEN HE WAS UNBOUND IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD BORNE AS MUCH AS THE HUMAN FRAME CAN BEAR WITHOUT DISSOLUTION JAMES WAS ENTREATED TO REMIT THE SECOND FLOGGING HIS ANSWER WAS SHORT AND CLEAR HE SHALL GO THROUGH WITH IT IF HE HAS BREATH IN HIS BODY
TALBOT WAS DESCENDED FROM AN OLD NORMAN FAMILY WHICH HAD BEEN LONG SETTLED IN LEINSTER WHICH HAD THERE SUNK INTO DEGENERACY WHICH HAD ADOPTED THE MANNERS OF THE CELTS WHICH HAD LIKE THE CELTS ADHERED TO THE OLD RELIGION
AND WHO HAD BEEN REWARDED FOR HIS SERVICES WITH THE TITLE
A SPIRIT AS FIERCE AND DETERMINED AS HIS OWN AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT
WAS TO WALLACE RELIGION GAVE HER SANCTION TO THAT INTENSE AND UNQUENCHABLE ANIMOSITY HUNDREDS OF CALVINISTIC PREACHERS PROCLAIMED THAT THE SAME POWER WHICH HAD SET APART SAMSON FROM THE WOMB
HE WAS BROUGHT FORTH TO UNDERGO HIS FIRST FLOGGING AT AN EARLY HOUR AN INNUMERABLE MULTITUDE FILLED ALL THE STREETS FROM ALDGATE TO THE OLD BAILEY THE HANGMAN LAID ON THE LASH WITH SUCH UNUSUAL SEVERITY AS SHOWED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
HAD HEARD THAT A PERSECUTION OF SINGULAR BARBARITY HAD RAGED IN OUR ISLAND AGAINST THE PROFESSORS OF THE TRUE FAITH THAT MANY PIOUS MEN HAD SUFFERED MARTYRDOM AND THAT TITUS OATES HAD BEEN THE CHIEF MURDERER THERE WAS THEREFORE
WHEN SINKING UNDER MORTIFICATION PAIN SICKNESS AND SORROW WHICH TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF HIS CAREER SEEMED DURING A SHORT TIME TO LANGUISH BUT WHICH SOON BROKE FORTH AGAIN FIERCER THAN EVER AND CONTINUED TO ANIMATE HIM
A TITLE WHICH THE EVENTS OF THE PRECEDING CENTURY HAD MADE ONE OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS IN EUROPE FROM A CITY WHICH LIES ON THE BANKS OF THE RHONE NOT FAR FROM AVIGNON AND WHICH LIKE AVIGNON
HIS OPINIONS RESPECTING ECCLESIASTICAL POLITY AND MODES OF WORSHIP WERE LATITUDINARIAN HE OWNED THAT EPISCOPACY WAS A LAWFUL AND CONVENIENT FORM OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT BUT HE SPOKE WITH SHARPNESS AND SCORN OF THE BIGOTRY OF THOSE
BUT HIS CAPACITY WAS SCARCELY EQUAL TO WHAT HIS GREAT PLACE REQUIRED HE HAD BECOME SLUGGISH AND SELF INDULGENT LIKED THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY AND OF THE TABLE BETTER THAN BUSINESS AND ON GREAT EMERGENCIES
HE HAD SEEN WITH STILL DEEPER DISPLEASURE THE COUNTENANCE GIVEN BY A LARGE SECTION OF THAT PARTY TO THE PRETENSIONS OF MONMOUTH THE OPPOSITION IT SEEMED WISHED FIRST TO MAKE THE CROWN OF ENGLAND NOT WORTH THE WEARING
DISCUSSING LITERARY QUESTIONS WITH WALLER AND SAINT EVREMOND AND CORRESPONDING WITH LA FONTAINE TO ACQUIRE A CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH POLITICS
EVEN WHEN HE RENDERED TO HER THOSE SERVICES OF WHICH AT THIS DAY WE FEEL THE HAPPY EFFECTS HER WELFARE WAS NOT HIS CHIEF OBJECT WHATEVER PATRIOTIC FEELING HE HAD WAS FOR HOLLAND
OATES HAD FEW FRIENDS LEFT THE MOST RESPECTABLE WHIGS WERE NOW CONVINCED THAT EVEN IF HIS NARRATIVE HAD SOME FOUNDATION IN FACT HE HAD ERECTED ON THAT FOUNDATION A VAST SUPERSTRUCTURE OF ROMANCE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF LOW FANATICS HOWEVER
NEWCASTLE WAS LIGHTED UP WITH GREAT PILES OF COAL
IN NORTHUMBERLAND THE TRIUMPH OF SIR JOHN FENWICK A COURTIER WHOSE NAME AFTERWARDS OBTAINED A MELANCHOLY CELEBRITY WAS ATTENDED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EXCITED INTEREST IN LONDON
WHICH IT IS FOR HIS INTEREST TO HIDE TALBOT RAISED BY JAMES TO THE EARLDOM OF TYRCONNEL HAD COMMANDED THE TROOPS IN IRELAND DURING THE NINE MONTHS
STILL REGARDED HIM AS A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR THESE PEOPLE WELL KNEW THAT IF HE WERE CONVICTED HIS SENTENCE WOULD BE ONE OF EXTREME SEVERITY AND WERE THEREFORE INDEFATIGABLE IN THEIR ENDEAVOURS TO MANAGE AN ESCAPE
BUT AGE AND DISEASE HAD MADE NO ESSENTIAL CHANGE IN HIS CHARACTER AND MANNERS HE STILL WHENEVER HE OPENED HIS MOUTH
HE ALLIED HIMSELF CLOSELY WITH CASTELMAINE DOVER AND ALBEVILLE THESE MEN CALLED WITH ONE VOICE FOR WAR ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH AND THE STATE
WAS TO HIM WHAT THE ROMAN REPUBLIC WAS TO HANNIBAL WHAT THE OTTOMAN POWER WAS TO SCANDERBEG
AND EVEN FOR REPRIMANDS FROM VERSAILLES
BROUGHT HIM SAFE TO LAND AND THAT ON TWENTY FIELDS OF BATTLE THE CANNON BALLS PASSED HIM BY TO RIGHT AND LEFT THE ARDOUR AND PERSEVERANCE WITH WHICH HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO HIS MISSION
ONE OF THEM THE EARL OF HUNTINGDON BITTERLY REPROACHED HIM WITH HAVING DECEIVED THE HOUSES AND DRAWN ON THEM THE GUILT OF SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD THE JUDGES BROWBEAT AND REVILED THE PRISONER WITH AN INTEMPERANCE WHICH
HIS CONTEST WITH LEWIS TRANSFERRED FROM THE FIELD TO THE CABINET WAS SOON EXASPERATED BY A PRIVATE FEUD IN TALENTS TEMPER MANNERS AND OPINIONS THE RIVALS WERE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER
WHEREVER HE HAD APPEARED MEN HAD UNCOVERED THEIR HEADS TO HIM THE LIVES AND ESTATES OF THE MAGNATES OF THE REALM HAD BEEN AT HIS MERCY TIMES HAD NOW CHANGED
IMPROVIDENCE AND ECCENTRIC IMPUDENCE HE WAS IN TRUTH ONE OF THE MOST MERCENARY AND CRAFTY OF MANKIND HE WAS NOW NO LONGER YOUNG AND WAS EXPIATING BY SEVERE SUFFERINGS THE DISSOLUTENESS OF HIS YOUTH
IT WAS IN THE AGONY OF THAT CONFLICT WHEN PEASANTS WERE FLYING IN TERROR BEFORE THE INVADERS WHEN HUNDREDS OF FAIR GARDENS AND PLEASURE HOUSES WERE BURIED BENEATH THE WAVES WHEN THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE STATES WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE FAINTING
WAS A SPELL WHICH HAD THROUGH THREE GENERATIONS CALLED FORTH THE AFFECTIONATE ENTHUSIASM OF BOORS AND ARTISANS THE DUTCH LANGUAGE WAS THE LANGUAGE OF HIS NURSERY AMONG THE DUTCH GENTRY HE HAD CHOSEN HIS EARLY FRIENDS
YET EVEN HIS AFFECTION FOR THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH WAS SUBORDINATE TO ANOTHER FEELING WHICH EARLY BECAME SUPREME IN HIS SOUL WHICH MIXED ITSELF WITH ALL HIS PASSIONS WHICH IMPELLED HIM TO MARVELLOUS ENTERPRISES WHICH SUPPORTED HIM
THE DOORS OF THE PRISON CLOSED UPON HIM DURING MANY MONTHS HE REMAINED IRONED IN THE DARKEST HOLE OF NEWGATE IT WAS SAID THAT IN HIS CELL HE GAVE HIMSELF UP TO MELANCHOLY AND SATE WHOLE DAYS UTTERING DEEP GROANS
THE WITNESSES OF THE PLOT HE MAY WELL BE EXCUSED FOR HATING THEM
AND TO CREATE ANOTHER HOLLAND IN COUNTRIES BEYOND THE REACH OF THE TYRANNY OF FRANCE NO OBSTACLE WOULD THEN REMAIN TO CHECK THE PROGRESS OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON A FEW YEARS AND THAT HOUSE MIGHT ADD TO ITS DOMINIONS
THE WORST OF MURDERERS TO THE GUILT OF SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD
THAT OATES WAS A BAD MAN IS NOT A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR THE GUILTY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THE FIRST TO SUFFER THOSE HARDSHIPS WHICH ARE AFTERWARDS USED AS PRECEDENTS AGAINST THE INNOCENT THUS IT WAS IN THE PRESENT CASE
GREAT JOY IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE DIVINE JUSTICE HAD OVERTAKEN HIM ENGRAVINGS OF HIM LOOKING OUT FROM THE PILLORY AND WRITHING AT THE CART'S TAIL WERE CIRCULATED ALL OVER EUROPE AND EPIGRAMMATISTS IN MANY LANGUAGES
THE AMUSEMENTS THE ARCHITECTURE THE LANDSCAPE OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HAD TAKEN HOLD ON HIS HEART TO HER HE TURNED WITH CONSTANT FONDNESS FROM A PROUDER AND FAIRER RIVAL IN THE GALLERY OF WHITEHALL
LEWIS POLITE AND DIGNIFIED PROFUSE AND VOLUPTUOUS FOND OF DISPLAY AND AVERSE FROM DANGER A MUNIFICENT PATRON OF ARTS AND LETTERS AND A CRUEL PERSECUTOR OF CALVINISTS
NATURALLY UNGENTLE HAD BEEN EXASPERATED BY HIS DOMESTIC VEXATIONS BY THE PUBLIC REPROACHES AND BY WHAT HE HAD UNDERGONE IN THE DAYS OF THE POPISH PLOT HE HAD BEEN LONG A PRISONER AND HAD AT LENGTH BEEN TRIED FOR HIS LIFE
WESTMINSTER HALL WAS CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS AMONG WHOM WERE MANY ROMAN CATHOLICS
AND HE OWNED IT WITHOUT A BLUSH THE INJURED LADY BECAME DUCHESS OF YORK HAD HER HUSBAND BEEN A MAN REALLY UPRIGHT AND HONOURABLE HE WOULD HAVE DRIVEN FROM HIS PRESENCE WITH INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT THE WRETCHES WHO HAD SLANDERED HER
AND ON THE VERY NIGHT PRECEDING THE TRIAL A LADDER OF ROPES WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE CELL
THAT THEY WOULD THANKFULLY ACCEPT ALMOST ANY TERMS OF RECONCILIATION THE NEW ENVOY'S ORIGIN WAS PLEBEIAN HIS STATURE WAS DWARFISH HIS COUNTENANCE WAS LUDICROUSLY UGLY
IN SPITE OF EVERY DISADVANTAGE OF BIRTH AND FIGURE HE WAS SOON KNOWN AS A MOST PLEASING COMPANION AND AS A MOST SKILFUL DIPLOMATIST HE CONTRIVED WHILE FLIRTING WITH THE DUCHESS OF MAZARIN
HE PINED FOR THE FAMILIAR HOUSE IN THE WOOD AT THE HAGUE AND NEVER WAS SO HAPPY AS WHEN HE COULD QUIT THE MAGNIFICENCE OF WINDSOR FOR HIS FAR HUMBLER SEAT AT LOO DURING HIS SPLENDID BANISHMENT
HE WAS SENT TO LONDON CHARGED WITH SEVERAL SPECIAL COMMISSIONS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE HE WAS TO LAY THE GROUND FOR A TREATY OF COMMERCE HE WAS TO ASCERTAIN AND REPORT THE STATE OF THE ENGLISH FLEETS
TWO BILLS OF INDICTMENT AGAINST HIM FOR PERJURY HAD BEEN FOUND BY THE GRAND JURY OF MIDDLESEX A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE DEATH OF CHARLES SOON AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE ELECTIONS THE TRIAL CAME ON AMONG THE UPPER AND MIDDLE CLASSES
BY THE INTELLIGENCE AND INDUSTRY WHICH HE HAD EXHIBITED AS A CLERK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE MARINE AND WAS ESTEEMED AN ADEPT IN THE MYSTERY OF MERCANTILE POLITICS AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE
WENT THROUGH THE FORM OF TENDERING HIS BEST SERVICES TO LEWIS BUT THIS CIVILITY WAS RATED AT ITS TRUE VALUE AND REQUITED WITH A DRY REPRIMAND THE GREAT KING AFFECTED CONTEMPT FOR THE PETTY PRINCE
THE BLOOD RAN DOWN IN RIVULETS FOR A TIME THE CRIMINAL SHOWED A STRANGE CONSTANCY BUT AT LAST HIS STUBBORN FORTITUDE GAVE WAY HIS BELLOWINGS WERE FRIGHTFUL TO HEAR HE SWOONED SEVERAL TIMES BUT THE SCOURGE STILL CONTINUED TO DESCEND
THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY COMPETENT TO INFLICT WHIPPING NOR HAD THE LAW ASSIGNED A LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF STRIPES BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW CLEARLY WAS THAT NO MISDEMEANOUR SHOULD BE PUNISHED MORE SEVERELY THAN THE MOST ATROCIOUS FELONIES
LORAINE AND FLANDERS
UNDERTOOK TO FURNISH THEY AGREED TO DESCRIBE THE POOR YOUNG LADY AS A CREATURE WITHOUT VIRTUE SHAME OR DELICACY AND MADE UP LONG ROMANCES ABOUT TENDER INTERVIEWS AND STOLEN FAVOURS
SERVICEABLE SAVAGE PORTIONS THAT WE FALL BACK ON EMERGENCIES NOT ON THE POLISHED BUT UNSUBSTANTIAL TWENTIETH CIVILIZATION SHOULD WIPE AWAY OUR TEARS
AS FOR THE NOTE I HAD SENT HIM BY JIM THAT WORTHY LOST IT AND HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT TILL TO DAY BUT ACTING UPON INFORMATION HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE NATIVES HE HEADED NOT FOR SHEBA'S BREASTS
IT IS VERY HARD HAVING ONLY ONE SON TO LOSE HIM THUS BUT GOD'S WILL BE DONE WHO AM I THAT I SHOULD COMPLAIN THE GREAT WHEEL OF FATE
AND WAITED IN SILENCE WATCHING THE BIG FLAKES FALL GENTLY ONE BY ONE LIKE HEAVENLY BENEDICTIONS AND MELT IN TEARS ON HARRY'S PALL
AND RECOMMENDED US TO SELL BY DEGREES
YOU CAN FINISH WRITING THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES ON BOARD SHIP WE HAVE REFUSED TO TELL THE TALE TILL IT IS WRITTEN BY YOU FOR FEAR LEST WE SHALL NOT BE BELIEVED IF YOU START ON RECEIPT OF THIS
THE ABOVE SIGNED ALLAN QUATERMAIN IS AN EXTRACT FROM MY DIARY WRITTEN TWO YEARS AND MORE AGO I COPY IT DOWN HERE BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME
ITS STIFF FORMAL MANNERS AND ITS WELL DRESSED CROWDS HE BEGINS TO LONG AH HOW HE LONGS FOR THE KEEN BREATH OF THE DESERT AIR
I CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT I AM NOT FAR OFF HARRY WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND I USED TO LIVE IN A VERY FINE HOUSE AT LEAST I CALL IT A FINE HOUSE SPEAKING COMPARATIVELY
HE HAD PASSED HIS LAST EXAMINATION WITH HONOURS AND I WAS PROUD OF THEM MUCH PROUDER THAN HE WAS I THINK AND THEN HE MUST NEEDS GO TO THAT SMALLPOX HOSPITAL HE WROTE TO ME THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF SMALLPOX
AND REALLY I AM AFRAID TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY PUT THEM AT IT SEEMS SO ENORMOUS
HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE HE HAD BEEN HOME HE HADN'T SEEN A WOMAN TO TOUCH HER EITHER AS REGARDS HER FIGURE OR THE SWEETNESS OF HER EXPRESSION I WANT YOU TO COME HOME MY DEAR OLD COMRADE
YOU WILL REACH HERE BY CHRISTMAS AND I BOOK YOU TO STAY WITH ME FOR THAT GOOD IS COMING AND GEORGE AND SO BY THE WAY IS YOUR BOY HARRY THERE'S A BRIBE FOR YOU
EVEN AS I SAID IT THE DOOR OF THE HUT OPENED AND THERE LIMPED OUT OF IT A WHITE MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND WITH AN ENORMOUS BLACK BEARD I THOUGHT THAT I MUST HAVE GOT A TOUCH OF THE SUN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
ALL THESE THINGS SUGGEST TOUCHES OF KINSHIP AND YOU REMEMBER THAT IN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF YOUR NATURE YOU ARE QUITE IDENTICAL AS FOR YOU SIR WHO ALSO LAUGH
APPLIED FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF COURSE THEY HAVE GREAT ADVANTAGES HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE BUT THEN REMEMBER WE BREED THE SICKLY PEOPLE WHO FILL THEM IN A SAVAGE LAND THEY DO NOT EXIST
HERE A GAIN THERE A LOSS AND NATURE'S GREAT AVERAGE STRUCK ACROSS THE TWO WHEREOF THE SUM TOTAL FORMS ONE OF THE FACTORS IN THAT MIGHTY EQUATION
AND WANTED TO GAIN THE EXPERIENCE AND NOW THE DISEASE HAS KILLED HIM AND I OLD AND GREY AND WITHERED AM LEFT TO MOURN OVER HIM WITHOUT A CHICK OR CHILD TO COMFORT ME
HIS TIME IS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN SHAVING AND OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE VAIN ADORNING OF THE BODY
AND KICKED LIKE THE VERY DEUCE WELL UP AND DOWN I WALKED STARING AT THE GUNS AND THE HORNS WHICH THE GUNS HAD BROUGHT LOW AND AS I DID SO THERE ROSE UP IN ME A GREAT CRAVING
UNDEFILED AS YET BY ANY HUMAN SINKS OF SWELTERING HUMANITY I WOULD GO AGAIN WHERE THE WILD GAME WAS BACK TO THE LAND WHEREOF NONE KNOW THE HISTORY BACK TO THE SAVAGES WHOM I LOVE
THAT IT IS THE FITTEST BEGINNING TO THE HISTORY THAT I AM ABOUT TO WRITE IF IT PLEASE GOD TO SPARE ME TO FINISH IT IF NOT WELL IT DOES NOT MATTER THAT EXTRACT WAS PENNED SEVEN THOUSAND MILES OR SO
BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL A ROBIN REDBREAST CAME AS BOLD AS COULD BE AND LIT UPON THE COFFIN AND BEGAN TO SING AND THEN I AM AFRAID THAT I BROKE DOWN
IS TO A LARGE EXTENT FREE FROM THE GREED OF MONEY WHICH EATS LIKE A CANCER INTO THE HEART OF THE WHITE MAN IT IS A DEPRESSING CONCLUSION BUT IN ALL ESSENTIALS THE SAVAGE
FROM THAT DAY HE HAD BEEN SO LAME THAT HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO EITHER FORWARD OR BACK
I WOULD THAT IT HAD BEEN MY SOUL AND NOT MY BOY'S WE BURIED HIM THIS AFTERNOON UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREY AND ANCIENT TOWER OF THE CHURCH OF THIS VILLAGE WHERE MY HOUSE IS
LYING IN THE CHURCHYARD WITHOUT FEELING AS THOUGH MY HEART WOULD BREAK IN TWO AND NOW THERE IS AN END OF THIS EGOTISTICAL TALK AND THERE SHALL BE NO MORE OF IT
SIX MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF OUR RE ARRIVAL AT SITANDA'S WHERE WE FOUND OUR GUNS AND OTHER GOODS QUITE SAFE THOUGH THE OLD RASCAL IN CHARGE WAS MUCH DISGUSTED AT OUR SURVIVING TO CLAIM THEM
FINALLY WE PREVAILED UPON HIM TO CONSENT TO THIS ARRANGEMENT BUT GEORGE CURTIS DID NOT KNOW OF IT UNTIL SOME TIME AFTERWARDS
AND SO DID SIR HENRY CURTIS STRONG MAN THOUGH HE IS AND AS FOR CAPTAIN GOOD I SAW HIM TURN AWAY TOO EVEN IN MY OWN DISTRESS I COULD NOT HELP NOTICING IT
NO MAN WHO HAS FOR FORTY YEARS LIVED THE LIFE I HAVE CAN WITH IMPUNITY GO COOP HIMSELF IN THIS PRIM ENGLISH COUNTRY WITH ITS TRIM HEDGEROWS AND CULTIVATED FIELDS
TO THE CERTAINTY OF PERISHING IN THE DESERT AS FOR FOOD HOWEVER THEY GOT ON PRETTY WELL FOR THEY HAD A GOOD SUPPLY OF AMMUNITION AND THE OASIS WAS FREQUENTED ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT BY LARGE QUANTITIES OF GAME
ALL OF WHICH I HAD SHOT MYSELF THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS AS I NEVER KEEP ANY HORNS WHICH ARE NOT IN EVERY WAY PERFECT UNLESS IT MAY BE NOW AND AGAIN ON ACCOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATIONS CONNECTED WITH THEM
I LONGED ONCE MORE TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE ARMS OF NATURE NOT THE NATURE WHICH YOU KNOW THE NATURE THAT WAVES IN WELL KEPT WOODS AND SMILES OUT IN CORN FIELDS BUT NATURE
BESIDES THE QUESTION WILL ARISE HOW MANY OF THESE BLESSINGS ARE DUE TO CHRISTIANITY AS DISTINCT FROM CIVILIZATION AND SO THE BALANCE SWAYS AND THE STORY RUNS
OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NOW LOST COUNT FELL ALSO DO NOT LET ME HOWEVER BE UNDERSTOOD AS DECRYING OUR MODERN INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTING AS THEY DO THE GATHERED EXPERIENCE OF HUMANITY
DONE MY BEST TO LEARN THE WAYS OF THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT AND WHAT HAVE I FOUND A GREAT GULF FIXED NO ONLY A VERY LITTLE ONE THAT A PLAIN MAN'S THOUGHT MAY SPRING ACROSS
AND WATCH THE LINES OF GAME TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIDGES TO THE WATER THE RULING PASSION IS STRONG IN DEATH THEY SAY AND MY HEART WAS DEAD THAT NIGHT BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF MY TROUBLE
AND NOW YOU OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD YOU WHO AS I FANCIED HAD LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT ME AND WERE LIVING COMFORTABLY IN OLD ENGLAND TURN UP
THEY LOOKED VERY WHITE UPON THE BLACK CLOTH THERE WAS A LITTLE HITCH ABOUT GETTING THE COFFIN DOWN INTO THE GRAVE THE NECESSARY ROPES HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN SO WE DREW BACK FROM IT
FOR FEAR LEST WE SHOULD FLOOD THE MARKET THEY OFFER HOWEVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FOR A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THEM YOU MUST COME HOME QUATERMAIN AND SEE ABOUT THESE THINGS
I HAVE JUST BURIED MY BOY MY POOR HANDSOME BOY OF WHOM I WAS SO PROUD AND MY HEART IS BROKEN
A KAFIR CAME UP MY AVENUE OF ORANGE TREES CARRYING A LETTER IN A CLEFT STICK WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT FROM THE POST IT TURNED OUT TO BE FROM SIR HENRY AND AS IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF I GIVE IT IN FULL
GEORGE CURTIS TOLD US HIS STORY WHICH IN ITS WAY WAS ALMOST AS EVENTFUL AS OUR OWN AND PUT SHORTLY AMOUNTED TO THIS A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO YEARS BEFORE HE HAD STARTED FROM SITANDA'S KRAAL
WHICH CAME THITHER FOR WATER THESE THEY SHOT OR TRAPPED IN PITFALLS USING THE FLESH FOR FOOD AND AFTER THEIR CLOTHES WORE OUT THE HIDES FOR CLOTHING
THERE I MIGHT GO ON FOR EVER BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD CIVILIZATION IS ONLY SAVAGERY SILVER GILT A VAINGLORY IS IT
AND LIKE A NORTHERN LIGHT COMES BUT TO FADE AND LEAVE THE SKY MORE DARK OUT OF THE SOIL OF BARBARISM IT HAS GROWN LIKE A TREE AND AS I BELIEVE
IT WAS A DREARY DECEMBER AFTERNOON AND THE SKY WAS HEAVY WITH SNOW BUT NOT MUCH WAS FALLING THE COFFIN WAS PUT DOWN BY THE GRAVE AND A FEW BIG FLAKES LIT UPON IT
UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE FOR THERE IS A VESTIBULE IN MY HOUSE IN ENGLAND ON ALL THE FOUR WALLS OF THIS VESTIBULE WERE PLACED PAIRS OF HORNS ABOUT A HUNDRED PAIRS ALTOGETHER
FIXED AS THE STARS MORE ENDURING THAN THE MOUNTAINS AS UNALTERABLE AS THE WAY OF THE ETERNAL HUMAN NATURE IS GOD'S KALEIDOSCOPE AND THE LITTLE BITS OF COLOURED GLASS
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUND AND NOW I COME TO PERHAPS THE STRANGEST ADVENTURE THAT HAPPENED TO US IN ALL THIS STRANGE BUSINESS
NINETEEN SAVAGE AND ONE CIVILIZED WE MUST LOOK TO THE NINETEEN SAVAGE PORTIONS OF OUR NATURE IF WE WOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND OURSELVES AND NOT TO THE TWENTIETH
INTO THE SOIL LIKE A TREE IT WILL ONCE MORE SOONER OR LATER FALL AGAIN AS THE EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION FELL AS THE HELLENIC CIVILIZATION FELL AND AS THE ROMAN CIVILIZATION AND MANY OTHERS
CIVILIZATION FAILS US UTTERLY BACK BACK WE CREEP AND LAY US LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN ON THE GREAT BREAST OF NATURE SHE THAT PERCHANCE MAY SOOTHE US AND MAKE US FORGET
THEY HAVE A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WEAR THAT VERY LOW DRESS TO THE SAVAGE WOMAN'S BEADS YOUR HABIT OF TURNING ROUND AND ROUND TO THE SOUND OF HORNS AND TOM TOMS
WHEREBY YOU WILL MAKE IT BULGE OUT THE OTHER BUT YOU WILL NEVER WHILE THE WORLD ENDURES AND MAN IS MAN INCREASE ITS TOTAL CIRCUMFERENCE IT IS THE ONE FIXED UNCHANGEABLE THING
AND FACING TO THE STREAM WAS A COSY HUT BUILT MORE OR LESS ON THE KAFIR PRINCIPLE WITH GRASS AND WITHES BUT HAVING A FULL LENGTH DOOR INSTEAD OF A BEE HOLE
WHEN SUDDENLY I STOPPED AND RUBBED MY EYES AS WELL I MIGHT THERE NOT TWENTY YARDS IN FRONT OF ME PLACED IN A CHARMING SITUATION UNDER THE SHADE OF A SPECIES OF FIG TREE
JUST AFTER DINGAAN SWEPT INTO NATAL AND SLAUGHTERED SIX HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SO THAT THE BOERS NAMED THE PLACE WHERE THEY DIED WEENEN OR THE PLACE OF WEEPING
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL COME IF IT IS ONLY TO OBLIGE
AND HAVING SPOKEN TO GOOD I TOLD SIR HENRY THAT IT WAS OUR JOINT WISH THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A THIRD PORTION OF THE DIAMONDS OR IF HE WOULD NOT THAT HIS SHARE SHOULD BE HANDED TO HIS BROTHER WHO HAD SUFFERED EVEN MORE THAN OURSELVES ON THE CHANCE OF GETTING THEM
BUT FOR THE LADDER LIKE DESCENT OF THE MOUNTAINS DOWN WHICH WE HAD JUST COME WHICH IS CLEARLY A BETTER ROUTE THAN THAT MARKED OUT IN OLD DOM SILVESTRA'S PLAN IN THE DESERT HE AND JIM HAD SUFFERED GREAT HARDSHIPS
AS SURELY AND AS CERTAINLY AS IT TURNS THE STARS AND CONTINUALLY FALL INTO NEW PATTERNS AND COMBINATIONS BUT THE COMPOSING ELEMENTS REMAIN THE SAME
BUT WE DID ACCOMPLISH IT SOMEHOW AND TO GIVE ITS DETAILS WOULD ONLY BE TO REPRODUCE MUCH OF WHAT HAPPENED TO US ON THE FORMER OCCASION
SITTING TILL LATE INTO THE NIGHT TO DO IT BY JOVE SAID GEORGE CURTIS WHEN I SHOWED HIM SOME OF THE DIAMONDS WELL AT LEAST YOU HAVE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOUR PAINS BESIDES MY WORTHLESS SELF
IN A PROMISCUOUS WAY AND FIND ME WHERE YOU LEAST EXPECTED IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD OF AND THE MOST MERCIFUL TOO THEN SIR HENRY SET TO WORK AND TOLD HIM THE MAIN FACTS OF OUR ADVENTURES
THAT HE MAY ENJOY REST BUT THE REST HAS COME TO HIM BEFORE THE LABOUR OH MY BOY MY BOY I AM LIKE THE MAN IN THE BIBLE WHO LAID UP MUCH GOODS
LET SOME MAN COME AND STRIKE YOU IN THE FACE WHILST YOU ARE ENJOYING THAT MARVELLOUS LOOKING DISH AND WE SHALL SOON SEE HOW MUCH OF THE SAVAGE THERE IS IN YOU
AND SO MANY THINGS GOOD BAD AND INDIFFERENT HAD HAPPENED TO ME THE THIRST FOR THE WILDERNESS WAS ON ME I COULD TOLERATE THIS PLACE NO MORE I WOULD GO AND DIE AS I HAD LIVED
AS SUCH STONES HAVE NEVER TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE BEEN PUT ON THE MARKET IN ANYTHING LIKE SUCH QUANTITIES IT APPEARS THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE OR TWO OF THE LARGEST THEY ARE OF THE FINEST WATER
AND MANY OTHER BOYS WHOM I SHALL NEVER KNOW MAY IN THE ACTS AND THOUGHTS OF ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS
I TRIED TO CROSS SOLOMON'S MOUNTAINS NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO WAS THE ANSWER SPOKEN IN THE HESITATING VOICE OF A MAN WHO HAS HAD LITTLE RECENT OPPORTUNITY OF USING HIS TONGUE BUT WHEN I REACHED HERE
AND ONE WHICH SHOWS HOW WONDERFULLY THINGS ARE BROUGHT ABOUT I WAS WALKING ALONG QUIETLY SOME WAY IN FRONT OF THE OTHER TWO DOWN THE BANKS OF THE STREAM WHICH RUNS FROM THE OASIS TILL IT IS SWALLOWED UP IN THE HUNGRY DESERT SANDS
BEAUTIFULLY SHAVED FROCK COAT FITTING LIKE A GLOVE BRAND NEW EYE GLASS ET CETERA ET CETERA I WENT AND WALKED IN THE PARK WITH HIM WHERE I MET SOME PEOPLE I KNOW AND AT ONCE TOLD THEM THE STORY OF HIS BEAUTIFUL WHITE LEGS
NOR WILL THERE BE ONE MORE BIT OF COLOURED GLASS NOR ONE LESS FOR EVER AND EVER THIS BEING SO SUPPOSING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT WE DIVIDE OURSELVES INTO TWENTY PARTS
WHAT DOES IT ALL COME TO FOR FORTY YEARS AND MORE I LIVED AMONG SAVAGES AND STUDIED THEM AND THEIR WAYS AND NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE LIVED HERE IN ENGLAND AND HAVE IN MY OWN STUPID MANNER
SAW US ALL ONCE MORE SAFE AND SOUND AT MY LITTLE PLACE ON THE BEREA NEAR DURBAN WHERE I AM NOW WRITING
FETCHED UP ALL RIGHT IN ENGLAND WE GOT OFF THE BOAT AT SOUTHAMPTON AND WENT UP TO TOWN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT A SWELL
NO HUNTER EVER CAME TO SUCH A PLACE AS THIS CERTAINLY NO HUNTER WOULD EVER SETTLE IN IT I STARED AND STARED AND SO DID THE OTHER MAN AND JUST AT THAT JUNCTURE SIR HENRY AND GOOD WALKED UP
WHO GAVE US BIRTH AND WILL IN A DAY TO COME GIVE US OUR BURIAL ALSO AND SO IN MY TROUBLE AS I WALKED UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE OF MY HOUSE THERE IN YORKSHIRE
ALLAN QUATERMAIN BY H RIDER HAGGARD I INSCRIBE THIS BOOK OF ADVENTURE TO MY SON ARTHUR JOHN RIDER HAGGARD IN THE HOPE THAT IN DAYS TO COME HE
AND THE CHILD OF CIVILIZATION ARE IDENTICAL I DARE SAY THAT THE HIGHLY CIVILIZED LADY READING THIS WILL SMILE AT AN OLD FOOL OF A HUNTER'S SIMPLICITY WHEN SHE THINKS OF HER BLACK BEAD BEDECKED SISTER
WHICH IS TO BE FOUND IN THE DESERT ON THE TOP OF A BANK IMMEDIATELY ABOVE HIM IN SO DOING HE LOOSENED A GREAT BOULDER OF ROCK WHICH FELL UPON GEORGE CURTIS'S RIGHT LEG CRUSHING IT FRIGHTFULLY
AND BUILDED BARNS GOODS FOR MY BOY AND BARNS FOR HIM TO STORE THEM IN AND NOW HIS SOUL HAS BEEN REQUIRED OF HIM AND I AM LEFT DESOLATE
AMONG THE WILD GAME AND THE SAVAGES YES AS I WALKED I BEGAN TO LONG TO SEE THE MOONLIGHT GLEAMING SILVERY WHITE OVER THE WIDE VELDT AND MYSTERIOUS SEA OF BUSH
BUT I COULD NOT EAT MUCH AND SOON I TOOK TO WALKING OR RATHER LIMPING BEING PERMANENTLY LAME FROM THE BITE OF A LION UP AND DOWN
I WOULD GO AWAY FROM THIS PLACE WHERE I LIVED IDLY AND AT EASE BACK AGAIN TO THE WILD LAND WHERE I HAD SPENT MY LIFE WHERE I MET MY DEAR WIFE AND POOR HARRY WAS BORN
MACUMAZAHN HE HALLOED DON'T YOU KNOW ME BAAS I'M JIM THE HUNTER I LOST THE NOTE YOU GAVE ME TO GIVE TO THE BAAS
BUT IF YOU WHOSE EYES MAY PERCHANCE ONE DAY FALL UPON MY WRITTEN THOUGHTS HAVE GOT SO FAR AS THIS I ASK YOU TO PERSEVERE SINCE WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS NOT WITHOUT ITS INTEREST
A BOULDER FELL ON MY LEG AND CRUSHED IT AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO NEITHER FORWARD NOR BACK THEN I CAME UP HOW DO YOU DO MISTER NEVILLE I SAID DO YOU REMEMBER ME
SUCH AS USED TO BE OWNED BY THE DUTCHMEN A ROER THEY CALL IT THAT GUN THE BOER I BOUGHT IT FROM MANY YEARS AGO TOLD ME HAD BEEN USED BY HIS FATHER AT THE BATTLE OF THE BLOOD RIVER
IT WAS EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN NOW MY DEAR OLD FELLOW BURST OUT SIR HENRY AT LAST I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD I HAVE BEEN OVER SOLOMON'S MOUNTAINS TO FIND YOU
HE DREAMS OF THE SIGHT OF ZULU IMPIS BREAKING ON THEIR FOES LIKE SURF UPON THE ROCKS AND HIS HEART RISES UP IN REBELLION AGAINST THE STRICT LIMITS OF THE CIVILIZED LIFE AH THIS CIVILIZATION
YOU CAN GO ROUND AND ROUND IT YOU CAN POLISH IT HIGHLY
IF IT IS ONLY TO SEE YOU HARRY MY BOY AND TO LOOK AFTER THE PRINTING OF THIS HISTORY WHICH IS A TASK THAT I DO NOT LIKE TO TRUST TO ANYBODY ELSE
AND SO GEORGE CURTIS ENDED WE HAVE LIVED FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS LIKE A SECOND ROBINSON CRUSOE AND HIS MAN FRIDAY HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT SOME NATIVES MIGHT COME HERE TO HELP US AWAY BUT NONE HAVE COME
WHICH REPRESENT OUR PASSIONS HOPES FEARS JOYS ASPIRATIONS TOWARDS GOOD AND EVIL AND WHAT NOT ARE TURNED IN HIS MIGHTY HAND
HE IS FURIOUS ESPECIALLY AS SOME ILL NATURED PERSON HAS PRINTED IT IN A SOCIETY PAPER TO COME TO BUSINESS GOOD AND I TOOK THE DIAMONDS TO STREETER'S TO BE VALUED AS WE ARRANGED
WE DO NOT PROSTRATE OURSELVES BEFORE IT LIKE THE POOR INDIANS WE FLY HITHER AND THITHER WE CRY FOR MERCY BUT IT IS OF NO USE THE BLACK FATE THUNDERS ON
AND BEGAN HOBBLING TOWARDS US WHEN HE WAS CLOSE HE FELL DOWN IN A SORT OF FAINT WITH A SPRING SIR HENRY WAS BY HIS SIDE GREAT POWERS HE CRIED
SO THAT WE MAY NOT BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE PRIDE OF KNOWLEDGE MAN'S CLEVERNESS IS ALMOST INDEFINITE AND STRETCHES LIKE AN ELASTIC BAND
BUT FINALLY THEY REACHED THIS OASIS WHERE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT BEFELL GEORGE CURTIS ON THE DAY OF THEIR ARRIVAL HE WAS SITTING BY THE STREAM AND JIM WAS EXTRACTING THE HONEY FROM THE NEST OF A STINGLESS BEE
AND LIKE HIM HE IS A COOL YOUNG HAND HE SHOT ME IN THE LEG CUT OUT THE PELLETS AND THEN REMARKED UPON THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING A MEDICAL STUDENT WITH EVERY SHOOTING PARTY GOOD BYE OLD BOY I CAN'T SAY ANY MORE
AND THE FELLOW FELL AT MY FEET AND ROLLED OVER AND OVER WEEPING FOR JOY YOU CARELESS SCOUNDREL I SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE WELL SJAMBOCKED THAT IS HIDED MEANWHILE
AND SO IT IS CALLED TO THIS DAY AND ALWAYS WILL BE CALLED AND MANY AN ELEPHANT HAVE I SHOT WITH THAT OLD GUN
LOOK HERE YOU FELLOWS I SAID IS THAT A WHITE MAN OR AM I MAD SIR HENRY LOOKED AND GOOD LOOKED AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE LAME WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK BEARD UTTERED A GREAT CRY
IS SPREAD ALL OVER THE OTHER NINETEEN MAKING THEM APPEAR QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY REALLY ARE AS THE BLACKING DOES A BOOT OR THE VENEER A TABLE IT IS ON THE NINETEEN ROUGH
YOUR FONDNESS FOR PIGMENTS AND POWDERS THE WAY IN WHICH YOU LOVE TO SUBJUGATE YOURSELF TO THE RICH WARRIOR WHO HAS CAPTURED YOU IN MARRIAGE AND THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH YOUR TASTE IN FEATHERED HEAD DRESSES VARIES
I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF EVER SEEING YOU AGAIN AND NOW I COME ACROSS YOU PERCHED IN THE DESERT LIKE AN OLD ASSVOEGEL
SIR HENRY LAUGHED THEY BELONG TO QUATERMAIN AND GOOD IT WAS A PART OF THE BARGAIN THAT THEY SHOULD DIVIDE ANY SPOILS THERE MIGHT BE THIS REMARK SET ME THINKING
I MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIM TOO I HAVE MONEY ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US AND MUCH MORE THAN ENOUGH KING SOLOMON'S MINES PROVIDED ME WITH THAT BUT I SAID NO LET THE BOY EARN HIS LIVING LET HIM LABOUR
IT IS MY BROTHER GEORGE AT THE SOUND OF THIS DISTURBANCE ANOTHER FIGURE ALSO CLAD IN SKINS EMERGED FROM THE HUT A GUN IN HIS HAND AND RAN TOWARDS US
AND IN ITS SEASON REDUCES US TO POWDER POOR HARRY TO GO SO SOON JUST WHEN HIS LIFE WAS OPENING TO HIM HE WAS DOING SO WELL AT THE HOSPITAL
MY LAST PAPER ASSIGNED SEVERAL REASONS WHY THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE WOULD BE BEST SECURED BY UNION AGAINST THE DANGER IT MAY BE EXPOSED TO BY JUST CAUSES OF WAR GIVEN TO OTHER NATIONS
THESE AND SIMILAR CONSIDERATIONS THEN INDUCED THE PEOPLE TO RELY GREATLY ON THE JUDGMENT AND INTEGRITY OF THE CONGRESS AND THEY TOOK THEIR ADVICE NOTWITHSTANDING THE VARIOUS ARTS AND ENDEAVORS USED TO DETER THEM FROM IT
AND THE MUTUAL TRANSPORTATION AND EXCHANGE OF THEIR VARIOUS COMMODITIES WITH EQUAL PLEASURE I HAVE AS OFTEN TAKEN NOTICE THAT PROVIDENCE HAS BEEN PLEASED TO GIVE THIS ONE CONNECTED COUNTRY TO ONE UNITED PEOPLE
AND THAT THE NOBLE ENTHUSIASM OF LIBERTY IS APT TO BE INFECTED WITH A SPIRIT OF NARROW AND ILLIBERAL DISTRUST ON THE OTHER HAND IT WILL BE EQUALLY FORGOTTEN THAT THE VIGOR OF GOVERNMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE SECURITY OF LIBERTY
WILL AS IT WERE CONSOLIDATE THEM INTO ONE CORPS AND THEREBY RENDER THEM MORE EFFICIENT THAN IF DIVIDED INTO THIRTEEN OR INTO THREE OR FOUR DISTINCT INDEPENDENT COMPANIES
ARE APT TO OPERATE AS WELL UPON THOSE WHO SUPPORT AS THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE RIGHT SIDE OF A QUESTION WERE THERE NOT EVEN THESE INDUCEMENTS TO MODERATION NOTHING COULD BE MORE ILL JUDGED THAN THAT INTOLERANT SPIRIT WHICH HAS AT ALL TIMES
IN SUCH A SITUATION AS NOT TO INVITE HOSTILITY OR INSULT FOR IT NEED NOT BE OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE PRETENDED AS WELL AS JUST CAUSES OF WAR IT IS TOO TRUE HOWEVER DISGRACEFUL IT MAY BE TO HUMAN NATURE
AMERICA WILL HAVE REASON TO EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE POET FAREWELL A LONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS
THAT EVEN SUCH MEN MAY BE ACTUATED BY UPRIGHT INTENTIONS AND IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION WHICH HAS MADE ITS APPEARANCE OR MAY HEREAFTER MAKE ITS APPEARANCE WILL SPRING FROM SOURCES BLAMELESS AT LEAST IF NOT RESPECTABLE
THE CERTAIN EVILS AND THE PROBABLE DANGERS TO WHICH EVERY STATE WILL BE EXPOSED FROM ITS DISSOLUTION THIS SHALL ACCORDINGLY CONSTITUTE THE SUBJECT OF MY NEXT ADDRESS
WHO SHALL COMMAND THE ALLIED ARMIES AND FROM WHICH OF THEM SHALL HE RECEIVE HIS ORDERS WHO SHALL SETTLE THE TERMS OF PEACE AND IN CASE OF DISPUTES WHAT UMPIRE SHALL DECIDE BETWEEN THEM AND COMPEL ACQUIESCENCE
WHAT A POOR PITIFUL FIGURE WILL AMERICA MAKE IN THEIR EYES HOW LIABLE WOULD SHE BECOME NOT ONLY TO THEIR CONTEMPT BUT TO THEIR OUTRAGE AND HOW SOON WOULD DEAR BOUGHT EXPERIENCE PROCLAIM
IT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY REMARKED THAT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN RESERVED TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY BY THEIR CONDUCT AND EXAMPLE TO DECIDE THE IMPORTANT QUESTION WHETHER SOCIETIES OF MEN ARE REALLY CAPABLE OR NOT
SUCH AS THIRST FOR MILITARY GLORY REVENGE FOR PERSONAL AFFRONTS AMBITION OR PRIVATE COMPACTS TO AGGRANDIZE OR SUPPORT THEIR PARTICULAR FAMILIES OR PARTISANS THESE AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MOTIVES WHICH AFFECT ONLY THE MIND OF THE SOVEREIGN
FOR SO IS THE FACT THAT THIS PLAN IS ONLY RECOMMENDED NOT IMPOSED YET LET IT BE REMEMBERED THAT IT IS NEITHER RECOMMENDED TO BLIND APPROBATION NOR TO BLIND REPROBATION BUT TO THAT SEDATE AND CANDID CONSIDERATION
IN THE PROGRESS OF THIS DISCUSSION I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO GIVE A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO ALL THE OBJECTIONS WHICH SHALL HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE THAT MAY SEEM TO HAVE ANY CLAIM TO YOUR ATTENTION
FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN JAY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
WHICH THE MAGNITUDE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT DEMAND AND WHICH IT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO RECEIVE BUT THIS AS WAS REMARKED IN THE FOREGOING NUMBER OF THIS PAPER IS MORE TO BE WISHED THAN EXPECTED THAT IT MAY BE SO CONSIDERED AND EXAMINED
AND CAN SUPPLY THEIR MARKETS CHEAPER THAN THEY CAN THEMSELVES NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EFFORTS TO PREVENT IT BY BOUNTIES ON THEIR OWN OR DUTIES ON FOREIGN FISH
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT JEALOUSIES AND UNEASINESSES MAY GRADUALLY SLIDE INTO THE MINDS AND CABINETS OF OTHER NATIONS AND THAT WE ARE NOT TO EXPECT THAT THEY SHOULD REGARD OUR ADVANCEMENT IN UNION IN POWER AND CONSEQUENCE BY LAND AND BY SEA
THAN STATE GOVERNMENTS OR SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES CAN POSSIBLY DO FOR WANT OF CONCERT AND UNITY OF SYSTEM IT CAN PLACE THE MILITIA UNDER ONE PLAN OF DISCIPLINE AND BY PUTTING THEIR OFFICERS IN A PROPER LINE OF SUBORDINATION TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE
IN THE TRADE TO CHINA AND INDIA WE INTERFERE WITH MORE THAN ONE NATION INASMUCH AS IT ENABLES US TO PARTAKE IN ADVANTAGES WHICH THEY HAD IN A MANNER MONOPOLIZED AND AS WE THEREBY SUPPLY OURSELVES WITH COMMODITIES
NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THE INDISPENSABLE NECESSITY OF GOVERNMENT AND IT IS EQUALLY UNDENIABLE THAT WHENEVER AND HOWEVER IT IS INSTITUTED THE PEOPLE MUST CEDE TO IT
IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT A GOVERNMENT INSTITUTED IN TIMES SO INAUSPICIOUS SHOULD ON EXPERIMENT BE FOUND GREATLY DEFICIENT AND INADEQUATE TO THE PURPOSE IT WAS INTENDED TO ANSWER
OF THE POWER EMOLUMENT AND CONSEQUENCE OF THE OFFICES THEY HOLD UNDER THE STATE ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE PERVERTED AMBITION OF ANOTHER CLASS OF MEN WHO WILL EITHER HOPE TO AGGRANDIZE THEMSELVES BY THE CONFUSIONS OF THEIR COUNTRY
WHICH IN ITS CONSEQUENCES MUST PROVE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT EVER ENGAGED THEIR ATTENTION THE PROPRIETY OF THEIR TAKING A VERY COMPREHENSIVE AS WELL AS A VERY SERIOUS VIEW OF IT WILL BE EVIDENT
VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES AND INCONVENIENCES WOULD BE INSEPARABLE FROM SUCH A SITUATION WHEREAS ONE GOVERNMENT WATCHING OVER THE GENERAL AND COMMON INTERESTS AND COMBINING AND DIRECTING THE POWERS AND RESOURCES OF THE WHOLE
THE ARMS AND THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY AS THE SAFETY OF THE WHOLE IS THE INTEREST OF THE WHOLE AND CANNOT BE PROVIDED FOR WITHOUT GOVERNMENT EITHER ONE OR MORE OR MANY LET US INQUIRE WHETHER ONE GOOD GOVERNMENT IS NOT
OFTEN LEAD HIM TO ENGAGE IN WARS NOT SANCTIFIED BY JUSTICE OR THE VOICE AND INTERESTS OF HIS PEOPLE BUT INDEPENDENT OF THESE INDUCEMENTS TO WAR WHICH ARE MORE PREVALENT IN ABSOLUTE MONARCHIES BUT WHICH WELL DESERVE OUR ATTENTION
THE SUBJECT SPEAKS ITS OWN IMPORTANCE COMPREHENDING IN ITS CONSEQUENCES NOTHING LESS THAN THE EXISTENCE OF THE UNION THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE PARTS OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THE FATE OF AN EMPIRE IN MANY RESPECTS THE MOST INTERESTING IN THE WORLD
THE HONEST ERRORS OF MINDS LED ASTRAY BY PRECONCEIVED JEALOUSIES AND FEARS SO NUMEROUS INDEED AND SO POWERFUL ARE THE CAUSES WHICH SERVE TO GIVE A FALSE BIAS TO THE JUDGMENT THAT WE UPON MANY OCCASIONS
OR SEDUCED BY A TOO GREAT FONDNESS FOR PEACE TO DECLINE HAZARDING THEIR TRANQUILLITY AND PRESENT SAFETY FOR THE SAKE OF NEIGHBORS OF WHOM PERHAPS THEY HAVE BEEN JEALOUS AND WHOSE IMPORTANCE THEY ARE CONTENT TO SEE DIMINISHED
NOT TO INVOLVE IN ITS DISCUSSION A VARIETY OF OBJECTS FOREIGN TO ITS MERITS AND OF VIEWS PASSIONS AND PREJUDICES LITTLE FAVORABLE TO THE DISCOVERY OF TRUTH
THAN THE ALTERNATIVE OF AN ADOPTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION OR A DISMEMBERMENT OF THE UNION IT WILL THEREFORE BE OF USE TO BEGIN BY EXAMINING THE ADVANTAGES OF THAT UNION
I AM WELL AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS TO RESOLVE INDISCRIMINATELY THE OPPOSITION OF ANY SET OF MEN MERELY BECAUSE THEIR SITUATIONS MIGHT SUBJECT THEM TO SUSPICION INTO INTERESTED OR AMBITIOUS VIEWS CANDOR WILL OBLIGE US TO ADMIT
WITH THEM AND WITH MOST OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS WE ARE RIVALS IN NAVIGATION AND THE CARRYING TRADE AND WE SHALL DECEIVE OURSELVES IF WE SUPPOSE THAT ANY OF THEM WILL REJOICE TO SEE IT FLOURISH
WE OUGHT TO SEEK IT IN A DIVISION OF THE STATES INTO DISTINCT CONFEDERACIES OR SOVEREIGNTIES HOWEVER EXTRAORDINARY THIS NEW DOCTRINE MAY APPEAR IT NEVERTHELESS HAS ITS ADVOCATES AND CERTAIN CHARACTERS WHO WERE MUCH OPPOSED TO IT FORMERLY
BUT IF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE HAD REASON TO CONFIDE IN THE MEN OF THAT CONGRESS FEW OF WHOM HAD BEEN FULLY TRIED OR GENERALLY KNOWN STILL GREATER REASON HAVE THEY NOW TO RESPECT THE JUDGMENT AND ADVICE OF THE CONVENTION
WOULD PUT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE UNION IN THE UTMOST JEOPARDY THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE THE CASE AND I SINCERELY WISH THAT IT MAY BE AS CLEARLY FORESEEN BY EVERY GOOD CITIZEN THAT WHENEVER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION ARRIVES
AND THAT WHENEVER SUCH INDUCEMENTS MAY FIND FIT TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OPERATION PRETENSES TO COLOR AND JUSTIFY THEM WILL NOT BE WANTING WISELY THEREFORE DO THEY CONSIDER UNION AND A GOOD NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
IT MAY PERHAPS BE THOUGHT SUPERFLUOUS TO OFFER ARGUMENTS TO PROVE THE UTILITY OF THE UNION A POINT NO DOUBT DEEPLY ENGRAVED ON THE HEARTS OF THE GREAT BODY OF THE PEOPLE IN EVERY STATE AND ONE WHICH IT MAY BE IMAGINED
THIS CONVENTION COMPOSED OF MEN WHO POSSESSED THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE AND MANY OF WHOM HAD BECOME HIGHLY DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR PATRIOTISM VIRTUE AND WISDOM IN TIMES WHICH TRIED THE MINDS AND HEARTS OF MEN
SEE WISE AND GOOD MEN ON THE WRONG AS WELL AS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF QUESTIONS OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE TO SOCIETY THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IF DULY ATTENDED TO WOULD FURNISH A LESSON OF MODERATION TO THOSE WHO ARE EVER SO MUCH PERSUADED
JEALOUS AND ALIEN SOVEREIGNTIES SIMILAR SENTIMENTS HAVE HITHERTO PREVAILED AMONG ALL ORDERS AND DENOMINATIONS OF MEN AMONG US TO ALL GENERAL PURPOSES WE HAVE UNIFORMLY BEEN ONE PEOPLE EACH INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN EVERYWHERE
TO JUDGE FROM THE CONDUCT OF THE OPPOSITE PARTIES WE SHALL BE LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY WILL MUTUALLY HOPE TO EVINCE THE JUSTNESS OF THEIR OPINIONS AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THEIR CONVERTS BY THE LOUDNESS OF THEIR DECLAMATIONS AND THE BITTERNESS OF THEIR INVECTIVES
CHARACTERIZED POLITICAL PARTIES FOR IN POLITICS AS IN RELIGION IT IS EQUALLY ABSURD TO AIM AT MAKING PROSELYTES BY FIRE AND SWORD HERESIES IN EITHER CAN RARELY BE CURED BY PERSECUTION AND YET
HOWEVER JUST THESE SENTIMENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO BE WE HAVE ALREADY SUFFICIENT INDICATIONS THAT IT WILL HAPPEN IN THIS AS IN ALL FORMER CASES OF GREAT NATIONAL DISCUSSION A TORRENT OF ANGRY AND MALIGNANT PASSIONS WILL BE LET LOOSE
SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE FOR EACH OTHER AND IT APPEARS AS IF IT WAS THE DESIGN OF PROVIDENCE THAT AN INHERITANCE SO PROPER AND CONVENIENT FOR A BAND OF BRETHREN UNITED TO EACH OTHER BY THE STRONGEST TIES SHOULD NEVER BE SPLIT INTO A NUMBER OF UNSOCIAL
THIS INTELLIGENT PEOPLE PERCEIVED AND REGRETTED THESE DEFECTS STILL CONTINUING NO LESS ATTACHED TO UNION THAN ENAMORED OF LIBERTY THEY OBSERVED THE DANGER WHICH IMMEDIATELY THREATENED THE FORMER AND MORE REMOTELY THE LATTER
CERTAIN IT IS THAT FOREIGN NATIONS WILL KNOW AND VIEW IT EXACTLY AS IT IS AND THEY WILL ACT TOWARD US ACCORDINGLY IF THEY SEE THAT OUR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IS EFFICIENT AND WELL ADMINISTERED
TO INSTITUTE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PRESERVE AND PERPETUATE IT THEY FORMED IT ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY HAD A POLITICAL EXISTENCE NAY AT A TIME WHEN THEIR HABITATIONS WERE IN FLAMES WHEN MANY OF THEIR CITIZENS WERE BLEEDING
THAT IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF A SOUND AND WELL INFORMED JUDGMENT THEIR INTEREST CAN NEVER BE SEPARATED AND THAT A DANGEROUS AMBITION MORE OFTEN LURKS BEHIND THE SPECIOUS MASK OF ZEAL FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE
BECAUSE THE CHEAPNESS AND EXCELLENCE OF OUR PRODUCTIONS ADDED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF VICINITY AND THE ENTERPRISE AND ADDRESS OF OUR MERCHANTS AND NAVIGATORS WILL GIVE US A GREATER SHARE IN THE ADVANTAGES WHICH THOSE TERRITORIES AFFORD
WHICH IS MORE COMMONLY THE FAULT OF THE HEAD THAN OF THE HEART WILL BE REPRESENTED AS MERE PRETENSE AND ARTIFICE THE STALE BAIT FOR POPULARITY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC GOOD IT WILL BE FORGOTTEN ON THE ONE HAND THAT JEALOUSY IS THE USUAL CONCOMITANT OF LOVE
OR WHOSE AMBITION AIMED AT OBJECTS WHICH DID NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE PUBLIC GOOD WERE INDEFATIGABLE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PERSUADE THE PEOPLE TO REJECT THE ADVICE OF THAT PATRIOTIC CONGRESS MANY INDEED WERE DECEIVED AND DELUDED
FOR AS OUR CARRYING TRADE CANNOT INCREASE WITHOUT IN SOME DEGREE DIMINISHING THEIRS IT IS MORE THEIR INTEREST AND WILL BE MORE THEIR POLICY TO RESTRAIN THAN TO PROMOTE IT
THAN UNDER THE FORBIDDEN APPEARANCE OF ZEAL FOR THE FIRMNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT HISTORY WILL TEACH US THAT THE FORMER HAS BEEN FOUND A MUCH MORE CERTAIN ROAD TO THE INTRODUCTION OF DESPOTISM THAN THE LATTER
AMONG THE MOST FORMIDABLE OF THE OBSTACLES WHICH THE NEW CONSTITUTION WILL HAVE TO ENCOUNTER MAY READILY BE DISTINGUISHED THE OBVIOUS INTEREST OF A CERTAIN CLASS OF MEN IN EVERY STATE TO RESIST ALL CHANGES WHICH MAY HAZARD A DIMINUTION
WOULD BE FREE FROM ALL THESE EMBARRASSMENTS AND CONDUCE FAR MORE TO THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE BUT WHATEVER MAY BE OUR SITUATION WHETHER FIRMLY UNITED UNDER ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT OR SPLIT INTO A NUMBER OF CONFEDERACIES
IN WHATEVER PART OF THE UNION THEY MAY BE FOUND
IT HAS UNTIL LATELY BEEN A RECEIVED AND UNCONTRADICTED OPINION THAT THE PROSPERITY OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA DEPENDED ON THEIR CONTINUING FIRMLY UNITED AND THE WISHES PRAYERS AND EFFORTS OF OUR BEST AND WISEST CITIZENS
AND WHEN THE PROGRESS OF HOSTILITY AND DESOLATION LEFT LITTLE ROOM FOR THOSE CALM AND MATURE INQUIRIES AND REFLECTIONS WHICH MUST EVER PRECEDE THE FORMATION OF A WISE AND WELL BALANCED GOVERNMENT FOR A FREE PEOPLE
BE ONE NATION UNDER ONE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THAT THEY SHOULD DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES AND GIVE TO THE HEAD OF EACH THE SAME KIND OF POWERS WHICH THEY ARE ADVISED TO PLACE IN ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
ALTHOUGH SUCH CONDUCT WOULD NOT BE WISE IT WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE NATURAL THE HISTORY OF THE STATES OF GREECE AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES ABOUNDS WITH SUCH INSTANCES AND IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT WHAT HAS SO OFTEN HAPPENED WOULD
WHICH WE USED TO PURCHASE FROM THEM THE EXTENSION OF OUR OWN COMMERCE IN OUR OWN VESSELS CANNOT GIVE PLEASURE TO ANY NATIONS WHO POSSESS TERRITORIES ON OR NEAR THIS CONTINENT
ENJOYING THE SAME NATIONAL RIGHTS PRIVILEGES AND PROTECTION AS A NATION WE HAVE MADE PEACE AND WAR AS A NATION WE HAVE VANQUISHED OUR COMMON ENEMIES AS A NATION WE HAVE FORMED ALLIANCES
ARE AT PRESENT OF THE NUMBER WHATEVER MAY BE THE ARGUMENTS OR INDUCEMENTS WHICH HAVE WROUGHT THIS CHANGE IN THE SENTIMENTS AND DECLARATIONS OF THESE GENTLEMEN IT CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE WISE IN THE PEOPLE AT LARGE TO ADOPT THESE NEW POLITICAL TENETS
IF ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOT CALLED FORTH ALL THE NATIONAL MEANS AND MATERIALS FOR FORMING FLEETS THEIR PROWESS AND THEIR THUNDER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED LET ENGLAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET
BUT THIS IS A THING MORE ARDENTLY TO BE WISHED THAN SERIOUSLY TO BE EXPECTED THE PLAN OFFERED TO OUR DELIBERATIONS AFFECTS TOO MANY PARTICULAR INTERESTS INNOVATES UPON TOO MANY LOCAL INSTITUTIONS
BY ANY IMPRESSIONS OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE EVIDENCE OF TRUTH YOU WILL NO DOUBT AT THE SAME TIME HAVE COLLECTED FROM THE GENERAL SCOPE OF THEM THAT THEY PROCEED FROM A SOURCE NOT UNFRIENDLY TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION
WHAT FLEETS COULD THEY EVER HOPE TO HAVE IF ONE WAS ATTACKED WOULD THE OTHERS FLY TO ITS SUCCOR AND SPEND THEIR BLOOD AND MONEY IN ITS DEFENSE WOULD THERE BE NO DANGER OF THEIR BEING FLATTERED INTO NEUTRALITY BY ITS SPECIOUS PROMISES
FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER SEVENTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN JAY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
EXPERIENCE ON A FORMER OCCASION TEACHES US NOT TO BE TOO SANGUINE IN SUCH HOPES IT IS NOT YET FORGOTTEN THAT WELL GROUNDED APPREHENSIONS OF IMMINENT DANGER INDUCED THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA TO FORM THE MEMORABLE CONGRESS OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
RELATIVE TO THE OBJECT IN QUESTION MORE COMPETENT THAN ANY OTHER GIVEN NUMBER WHATEVER
BUT THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA AGAINST DANGERS FROM FOREIGN FORCE DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON THEIR FORBEARING TO GIVE JUST CAUSES OF WAR TO OTHER NATIONS BUT ALSO ON THEIR PLACING AND CONTINUING THEMSELVES
THE CRISIS AT WHICH WE ARE ARRIVED MAY WITH PROPRIETY BE REGARDED AS THE ERA IN WHICH THAT DECISION IS TO BE MADE AND A WRONG ELECTION OF THE PART WE SHALL ACT MAY IN THIS VIEW
OR SPLIT INTO THREE OR FOUR INDEPENDENT AND PROBABLY DISCORDANT REPUBLICS OR CONFEDERACIES ONE INCLINING TO BRITAIN ANOTHER TO FRANCE AND A THIRD TO SPAIN AND PERHAPS PLAYED OFF AGAINST EACH OTHER BY THE THREE
WOULD THOSE THREE GOVERNMENTS IF THEY AGREED AT ALL BE ABLE WITH ALL THEIR RESPECTIVE FORCES TO OPERATE AGAINST THE ENEMY SO EFFECTUALLY AS THE SINGLE GOVERNMENT OF GREAT BRITAIN WOULD WE HAVE HEARD MUCH OF THE FLEETS OF BRITAIN
IN THE COURSE OF THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS I HAVE HAD AN EYE MY FELLOW CITIZENS TO PUTTING YOU UPON YOUR GUARD AGAINST ALL ATTEMPTS FROM WHATEVER QUARTER TO INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION IN A MATTER OF THE UTMOST MOMENT TO YOUR WELFARE
OF ESTABLISHING GOOD GOVERNMENT FROM REFLECTION AND CHOICE OR WHETHER THEY ARE FOREVER DESTINED TO DEPEND FOR THEIR POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONS ON ACCIDENT AND FORCE IF THERE BE ANY TRUTH IN THE REMARK
YES MY COUNTRYMEN I OWN TO YOU THAT AFTER HAVING GIVEN IT AN ATTENTIVE CONSIDERATION I AM CLEARLY OF OPINION IT IS YOUR INTEREST TO ADOPT IT I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS THE SAFEST COURSE FOR YOUR LIBERTY YOUR DIGNITY
ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR OWN STATE CONSTITUTION AND LASTLY THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS ADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT TO LIBERTY AND TO PROPERTY
AND THAT OF THOSE MEN WHO HAVE OVERTURNED THE LIBERTIES OF REPUBLICS THE GREATEST NUMBER HAVE BEGUN THEIR CAREER BY PAYING AN OBSEQUIOUS COURT TO THE PEOPLE COMMENCING DEMAGOGUES AND ENDING TYRANTS
WERE ALSO MEMBERS OF THIS CONVENTION AND CARRIED INTO IT THEIR ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK THAT NOT ONLY THE FIRST BUT EVERY SUCCEEDING CONGRESS AS WELL AS THE LATE CONVENTION
IN ALL PROBABILITY BE GRADUALLY PROPAGATED TILL IT HAS VOTARIES ENOUGH TO COUNTENANCE AN OPEN AVOWAL OF IT FOR NOTHING CAN BE MORE EVIDENT TO THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO TAKE AN ENLARGED VIEW OF THE SUBJECT
THAT BODY RECOMMENDED CERTAIN MEASURES TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND THE EVENT PROVED THEIR WISDOM YET IT IS FRESH IN OUR MEMORIES HOW SOON THE PRESS BEGAN TO TEEM WITH PAMPHLETS AND WEEKLY PAPERS AGAINST THOSE VERY MEASURES
FOR IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THAT CONGRESS WHO HAVE BEEN SINCE TRIED AND JUSTLY APPROVED FOR PATRIOTISM AND ABILITIES AND WHO HAVE GROWN OLD IN ACQUIRING POLITICAL INFORMATION
THAN CONSISTS WITH THE WISHES OR POLICY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SOVEREIGNS SPAIN THINKS IT CONVENIENT TO SHUT THE MISSISSIPPI AGAINST US ON THE ONE SIDE AND BRITAIN EXCLUDES US FROM THE SAINT LAWRENCE ON THE OTHER
HAVE INVARIABLY JOINED WITH THE PEOPLE IN THINKING THAT THE PROSPERITY OF AMERICA DEPENDED ON ITS UNION TO PRESERVE AND PERPETUATE IT WAS THE GREAT OBJECT OF THE PEOPLE IN FORMING THAT CONVENTION
AND THEREFORE THAT IT WAS NOT LESS THEIR INCLINATION THAN THEIR DUTY TO RECOMMEND ONLY SUCH MEASURES AS AFTER THE MOST MATURE DELIBERATION THEY REALLY THOUGHT PRUDENT AND ADVISABLE
AND YOUR HAPPINESS I AFFECT NOT RESERVES WHICH I DO NOT FEEL I WILL NOT AMUSE YOU WITH AN APPEARANCE OF DELIBERATION WHEN I HAVE DECIDED I FRANKLY ACKNOWLEDGE TO YOU MY CONVICTIONS
OUR TRADE PRUDENTLY REGULATED OUR MILITIA PROPERLY ORGANIZED AND DISCIPLINED OUR RESOURCES AND FINANCES DISCREETLY MANAGED OUR CREDIT RE ESTABLISHED OUR PEOPLE FREE CONTENTED AND UNITED
WHAT WOULD THE MILITIA OF BRITAIN BE IF THE ENGLISH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND IF THE SCOTCH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF SCOTLAND AND IF THE WELSH MILITIA OBEYED THE GOVERNMENT OF WALES SUPPOSE AN INVASION
AND THE TIME MAY COME IF WE ARE WISE WHEN THE FLEETS OF AMERICA MAY ENGAGE ATTENTION BUT IF ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOT SO REGULATED THE NAVIGATION OF BRITAIN AS TO MAKE IT A NURSERY FOR SEAMEN
ARE INFLUENCED BY PURER PRINCIPLES THAN THEIR ANTAGONISTS AMBITION AVARICE PERSONAL ANIMOSITY PARTY OPPOSITION AND MANY OTHER MOTIVES NOT MORE LAUDABLE THAN THESE
RESORT TO SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES OF DISTINCT PORTIONS OF THE WHOLE
THAT WHEN A PEOPLE OR FAMILY SO DIVIDE IT NEVER FAILS TO BE AGAINST THEMSELVES
AND BEING PERSUADED THAT AMPLE SECURITY FOR BOTH COULD ONLY BE FOUND IN A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MORE WISELY FRAMED THEY AS WITH ONE VOICE CONVENED THE LATE CONVENTION AT PHILADELPHIA TO TAKE THAT IMPORTANT SUBJECT UNDER CONSIDERATION
BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE REASONED AND DECIDED JUDICIOUSLY AND HAPPY THEY ARE IN REFLECTING THAT THEY DID SO THEY CONSIDERED THAT THE CONGRESS WAS COMPOSED OF MANY WISE AND EXPERIENCED MEN THAT
UNDERTOOK THE ARDUOUS TASK IN THE MILD SEASON OF PEACE WITH MINDS UNOCCUPIED BY OTHER SUBJECTS THEY PASSED MANY MONTHS IN COOL UNINTERRUPTED AND DAILY CONSULTATION AND FINALLY
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFTER AN UNEQUIVOCAL EXPERIENCE OF THE INEFFICACY OF THE SUBSISTING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU ARE CALLED UPON TO DELIBERATE ON A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
NOT ONLY MANY OF THE OFFICERS OF GOVERNMENT WHO OBEYED THE DICTATES OF PERSONAL INTEREST BUT OTHERS FROM A MISTAKEN ESTIMATE OF CONSEQUENCES OR THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF FORMER ATTACHMENTS
A PEOPLE DESCENDED FROM THE SAME ANCESTORS SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE PROFESSING THE SAME RELIGION ATTACHED TO THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT VERY SIMILAR IN THEIR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AND WHO
AND THOSE REASONS SHOW THAT SUCH CAUSES WOULD NOT ONLY BE MORE RARELY GIVEN BUT WOULD ALSO BE MORE EASILY ACCOMMODATED BY A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THAN EITHER BY THE STATE GOVERNMENTS OR THE PROPOSED LITTLE CONFEDERACIES
WITHOUT HAVING BEEN AWED BY POWER OR INFLUENCED BY ANY PASSIONS EXCEPT LOVE FOR THEIR COUNTRY THEY PRESENTED AND RECOMMENDED TO THE PEOPLE THE PLAN PRODUCED BY THEIR JOINT AND VERY UNANIMOUS COUNCILS ADMIT
AND I WILL FREELY LAY BEFORE YOU THE REASONS ON WHICH THEY ARE FOUNDED THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GOOD INTENTIONS DISDAINS AMBIGUITY I SHALL NOT HOWEVER MULTIPLY PROFESSIONS ON THIS HEAD MY MOTIVES MUST REMAIN IN THE DEPOSITORY OF MY OWN BREAST
OR WHY IS IT SUGGESTED THAT THREE OR FOUR CONFEDERACIES WOULD BE BETTER THAN ONE I AM PERSUADED IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT RIGHT ON THIS SUBJECT AND THAT THEIR UNIVERSAL AND UNIFORM ATTACHMENT TO THE CAUSE OF THE UNION
LET SCOTLAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET LET WALES HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET LET IRELAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET
