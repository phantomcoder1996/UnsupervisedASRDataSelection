IN MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN BY THE COMMUNICATION OF THE WONDERFUL EVENT HOW GREAT WAS HER DISAPPOINTMENT THE IMPORTANT AFFAIR WHICH MANY WORDS OF PREPARATION USHERED IN HAD BEEN FORESEEN BY THEM BOTH EVER SINCE HER BROTHER'S ARRIVAL
I DARE SAY IT WILL NOT BE A VERY GOOD BALL I KNOW THE MITCHELLS WILL NOT BE THERE I AM SURE I PITY EVERYBODY THAT IS BUT I DARE SAY MISTER MORLAND YOU LONG TO BE AT IT DO NOT YOU I AM SURE YOU DO
THORPE TALKED TO HIS HORSE AND SHE MEDITATED BY TURNS ON BROKEN PROMISES AND BROKEN ARCHES PHAETONS AND FALSE HANGINGS TILNEYS AND TRAP DOORS AS THEY ENTERED ARGYLE BUILDINGS HOWEVER SHE WAS ROUSED BY THIS ADDRESS FROM HER COMPANION
BUT WHAT WILL YOUR EXCELLENT FATHER AND MOTHER SAY OH HEAVENS WHEN I THINK OF THEM I AM SO AGITATED CATHERINE'S UNDERSTANDING BEGAN TO AWAKE AN IDEA OF THE TRUTH SUDDENLY DARTED INTO HER MIND AND
YOU WILL BE SO INFINITELY DEARER TO ME MY CATHERINE THAN EITHER ANNE OR MARIA I FEEL THAT I SHALL BE SO MUCH MORE ATTACHED TO MY DEAR MORLAND'S FAMILY THAN TO MY OWN THIS WAS A PITCH OF FRIENDSHIP BEYOND CATHERINE
DIVIDED BETWEEN REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF ONE GREAT PLEASURE AND THE HOPE OF SOON ENJOYING ANOTHER ALMOST ITS EQUAL IN DEGREE HOWEVER UNLIKE IN KIND SHE COULD NOT THINK THE TILNEYS HAD ACTED QUITE WELL BY HER
BUT TO WHAT PURPOSE DID SHE SPEAK THORPE ONLY LASHED HIS HORSE INTO A BRISKER TROT THE TILNEYS WHO HAD SOON CEASED TO LOOK AFTER HER WERE IN A MOMENT OUT OF SIGHT ROUND THE CORNER OF LAURA PLACE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS HERSELF WHISKED INTO THE MARKETPLACE
THAT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE HOW CHARMING IT HAD BEEN AND THAT IT HAD BEEN MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN ANYBODY COULD CONCEIVE SUCH WAS THE INFORMATION OF THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES THE SECOND UNFOLDED THUS MUCH IN DETAIL
IMPATIENT FOR THE REALIZATION OF ALL THAT HE HOPED AT HOME
WITH THE NATURAL BLUSH OF SO NEW AN EMOTION SHE CRIED OUT GOOD HEAVEN MY DEAR ISABELLA WHAT DO YOU MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU REALLY BE IN LOVE WITH JAMES THIS BOLD SURMISE HOWEVER SHE SOON LEARNT COMPREHENDED BUT HALF THE FACT
MY NOTION OF THINGS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH LET ME ONLY HAVE THE GIRL I LIKE SAY I WITH A COMFORTABLE HOUSE OVER MY HEAD AND WHAT CARE I FOR ALL THE REST FORTUNE IS NOTHING I AM SURE OF A GOOD INCOME OF MY OWN
PONDERING OVER THESE HEART RENDING TIDINGS CATHERINE WALKED SLOWLY UPSTAIRS AT THE HEAD OF THEM SHE WAS MET BY MISTER ALLEN WHO ON HEARING THE REASON OF THEIR SPEEDY RETURN
IT WILL BE SO DIRTY OH THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY I NEVER MIND DIRT NO REPLIED HER FRIEND VERY PLACIDLY I KNOW YOU NEVER MIND DIRT AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
OR FUNDED MONEY MADE OVER WAS A MATTER IN WHICH HER DISINTERESTED SPIRIT TOOK NO CONCERN SHE KNEW ENOUGH TO FEEL SECURE OF AN HONOURABLE AND SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT AND HER IMAGINATION TOOK A RAPID FLIGHT OVER ITS ATTENDANT FELICITIES
I DOUBT OUR BEING ABLE TO DO SO MUCH SAID MORLAND YOU CROAKING FELLOW CRIED THORPE WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO TEN TIMES MORE KINGSWESTON AYE AND BLAIZE CASTLE TOO AND ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN HEAR OF
THERE GO GO I INSIST ON IT THE TWO FRIENDS WITH HEARTS NOW MORE UNITED THAN EVER WERE INSEPARABLE FOR THE DAY AND IN SCHEMES OF SISTERLY HAPPINESS THE HOURS FLEW ALONG MISSUS THORPE AND HER SON
THOUGH RATHER THAN BE DISAPPOINTED OF THE PROMISED WALK AND ESPECIALLY RATHER THAN BE THOUGHT ILL OF BY THE TILNEYS SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN UP ALL THE HAPPINESS WHICH ITS WALLS COULD SUPPLY THE HAPPINESS OF A PROGRESS THROUGH A LONG SUITE OF LOFTY ROOMS
SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW HOW COULD I HELP IT JOHN WOULD HAVE ME GO FOR HE VOWED HE WOULD NOT DRIVE HER BECAUSE SHE HAD SUCH THICK ANKLES I DARE SAY SHE WILL NOT BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AGAIN THIS MONTH
BUT I HAVE A NOTION MISS MORLAND YOU AND I THINK PRETTY MUCH ALIKE UPON MOST MATTERS PERHAPS WE MAY
THAT I QUITE DOTED ON YOU THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW YOU BUT SO IT ALWAYS IS WITH ME THE FIRST MOMENT SETTLES EVERYTHING THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT MORLAND CAME TO US LAST CHRISTMAS THE VERY FIRST MOMENT I BEHELD HIM MY HEART WAS IRRECOVERABLY GONE
IT IS VERY ODD BUT I SUPPOSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO DIRTY FOR A WALK AND WELL THEY MIGHT FOR I NEVER SAW SO MUCH DIRT IN MY LIFE WALK YOU COULD NO MORE WALK THAN YOU COULD FLY IT HAS NOT BEEN SO DIRTY THE WHOLE WINTER IT IS ANKLE DEEP EVERYWHERE
ENCOURAGED HIS HORSE MADE ODD NOISES AND DROVE ON AND CATHERINE ANGRY AND VEXED AS SHE WAS HAVING NO POWER OF GETTING AWAY WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE POINT AND SUBMIT HER REPROACHES HOWEVER WERE NOT SPARED
TWICE WAS HE CALLED ALMOST FROM THE DOOR BY HER EAGERNESS TO HAVE HIM GONE INDEED MORLAND I MUST DRIVE YOU AWAY CONSIDER HOW FAR YOU HAVE TO RIDE I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU LINGER SO FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE WASTE NO MORE TIME
THERE ARE NOT MANY THAT I KNOW MY OWN MIND ABOUT BY JOVE NO MORE DO I
THE TWO YOUNGEST MISS THORPES WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE PARLOUR AND ON ANNE'S QUITTING IT TO CALL HER SISTER CATHERINE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING THE OTHER FOR SOME PARTICULARS OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY
OH I AM IN SUCH ECSTASIES AT THE THOUGHTS OF A LITTLE COUNTRY AIR AND QUIET SO MUCH BETTER THAN GOING TO THE LOWER ROOMS WE SHALL DRIVE DIRECTLY TO CLIFTON AND DINE THERE
I REMEMBER I WORE MY YELLOW GOWN WITH MY HAIR DONE UP IN BRAIDS AND WHEN I CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND JOHN INTRODUCED HIM I THOUGHT I NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO HANDSOME BEFORE HERE
IN SO READILY GIVING UP THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT SENDING HER ANY MESSAGE OF EXCUSE IT WAS NOW BUT AN HOUR LATER THAN THE TIME FIXED ON FOR THE BEGINNING OF THEIR WALK AND IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD OF THE PRODIGIOUS ACCUMULATION OF DIRT IN THE COURSE OF THAT HOUR
I DO NOT KNOW INDEED YES I KNOW HE DOES I SAW HIM YOU ARE TALKING OF THE MAN YOU DANCED WITH LAST NIGHT ARE NOT YOU YES WELL I SAW HIM AT THAT MOMENT TURN UP THE LANSDOWN ROAD DRIVING A SMART LOOKING GIRL
AND THAT IF PEOPLE WHO ROLLED IN MONEY COULD NOT AFFORD THINGS HE DID NOT KNOW WHO COULD WHICH CATHERINE DID NOT EVEN ENDEAVOUR TO UNDERSTAND DISAPPOINTED OF WHAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN THE CONSOLATION FOR HER FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT
OR AT LEAST IN TUSCANY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE THE NIGHT THAT POOR SAINT AUBIN DIED SUCH BEAUTIFUL WEATHER AT HALF PAST TWELVE WHEN CATHERINE'S ANXIOUS ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER WAS OVER AND SHE COULD NO LONGER CLAIM ANY MERIT FROM ITS AMENDMENT
I THOUGHT HOW IT WOULD BE SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WALK FOR ME TODAY SIGHED CATHERINE BUT PERHAPS IT MAY COME TO NOTHING OR IT MAY HOLD UP BEFORE TWELVE PERHAPS IT MAY BUT THEN MY DEAR
STILL HOWEVER AND DURING THE LENGTH OF ANOTHER STREET SHE ENTREATED HIM TO STOP PRAY PRAY STOP MISTER THORPE I CANNOT GO ON I WILL NOT GO ON I MUST GO BACK TO MISS TILNEY BUT MISTER THORPE ONLY LAUGHED SMACKED HIS WHIP
A REVERIE SUCCEEDED THIS CONVICTION AND WHEN ISABELLA SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS TO RESOLVE ON THE QUALITY OF HER WEDDING GOWN THEIR CONFERENCE WAS PUT AN END TO BY THE ANXIOUS YOUNG LOVER HIMSELF WHO CAME TO BREATHE HIS PARTING SIGH BEFORE HE SET OFF FOR WILTSHIRE
DECLARED HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO MEN SO MUCH ALIKE IN HIS LIFE AND WOULD HARDLY GIVE UP THE POINT OF ITS HAVING BEEN TILNEY HIMSELF THEIR DRIVE EVEN WHEN THIS SUBJECT WAS OVER WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY AGREEABLE
AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY WERE OFF CATHERINE'S FEELINGS AS SHE GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE
MAY WE GO UP EVERY STAIRCASE AND INTO EVERY SUITE OF ROOMS YES YES EVERY HOLE AND CORNER BUT THEN IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE GONE OUT FOR AN HOUR TILL IT IS DRYER AND CALL BY AND BY
OR EVEN OF HAVING THEIR LAMP THEIR ONLY LAMP EXTINGUISHED BY A SUDDEN GUST OF WIND AND OF BEING LEFT IN TOTAL DARKNESS IN THE MEANWHILE THEY PROCEEDED ON THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT ANY MISCHANCE AND WERE WITHIN VIEW OF THE TOWN OF KEYNSHAM
HER BROTHER SHE FOUND WAS PREPARING TO SET OFF WITH ALL SPEED TO FULLERTON TO MAKE KNOWN HIS SITUATION AND ASK CONSENT AND HERE WAS A SOURCE OF SOME REAL AGITATION TO THE MIND OF ISABELLA CATHERINE ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HER AS SHE WAS HERSELF PERSUADED THAT
I HATE THE IDEA OF ONE GREAT FORTUNE LOOKING OUT FOR ANOTHER AND TO MARRY FOR MONEY I THINK THE WICKEDEST THING IN EXISTENCE GOOD DAY
THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS MISSUS THORPE WITH TEARS OF JOY EMBRACED HER DAUGHTER HER SON HER VISITOR AND COULD HAVE EMBRACED HALF THE INHABITANTS OF BATH WITH SATISFACTION
THIS WAS OF COURSE VEHEMENTLY TALKED DOWN AS NO REASON AT ALL MISSUS ALLEN WAS CALLED ON TO SECOND HIM AND THE TWO OTHERS WALKED IN TO GIVE THEIR ASSISTANCE MY SWEETEST CATHERINE IS NOT THIS DELIGHTFUL WE SHALL HAVE A MOST HEAVENLY DRIVE
AND IT IS NOT ONLY GOOD NATURE BUT YOU HAVE SO MUCH SO MUCH OF EVERYTHING AND THEN YOU HAVE SUCH UPON MY SOUL I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY LIKE YOU OH
IF I CAN BUT BE NEAR YOU I SHALL BE SATISFIED BUT THIS IS IDLE TALKING I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS TILL WE HAVE YOUR FATHER'S ANSWER MORLAND SAYS THAT BY SENDING IT TONIGHT TO SALISBURY WE MAY HAVE IT TOMORROW TOMORROW
TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF CURIOSITY
DO YOU THAT'S HONEST BY HEAVENS I AM GLAD YOU ARE NO ENEMY TO MATRIMONY HOWEVER DID YOU EVER HEAR THE OLD SONG GOING TO ONE WEDDING BRINGS ON ANOTHER
THAT A BRIGHT AFTERNOON WOULD SUCCEED AND JUSTIFIED THE OPINION OF MISSUS ALLEN WHO HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD CLEAR UP BUT WHETHER CATHERINE MIGHT STILL EXPECT HER FRIENDS WHETHER THERE HAD NOT BEEN TOO MUCH RAIN FOR MISS TILNEY TO VENTURE MUST YET BE A QUESTION
I DINE WITH MISS TILNEY TODAY AND MUST NOW BE GOING HOME NAY BUT THERE IS NO SUCH CONFOUNDED HURRY WHO KNOWS WHEN WE MAY BE TOGETHER AGAIN NOT BUT THAT I SHALL BE DOWN AGAIN BY THE END OF A FORTNIGHT
AND INQUIRED FOR HER A FEW MINUTES AFTER HER SETTING OFF THAT WHEN HE TOLD THEM SHE WAS GONE OUT WITH MISTER THORPE THE LADY HAD ASKED WHETHER ANY MESSAGE HAD BEEN LEFT FOR HER AND ON HIS SAYING NO HAD FELT FOR A CARD BUT SAID SHE HAD NONE ABOUT HER AND WENT AWAY
BUT THE TILNEYS WERE ENTIRELY TO BLAME WHY WERE NOT THEY MORE PUNCTUAL IT WAS DIRTY INDEED BUT WHAT DID THAT SIGNIFY I AM SURE JOHN AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE MINDED IT I NEVER MIND GOING THROUGH ANYTHING WHERE A FRIEND IS CONCERNED THAT IS MY DISPOSITION
AND IN ONE MOMENT ALL WAS JOYFUL SECURITY THE BRIGHTEST GLOW WAS INSTANTLY SPREAD OVER ISABELLA'S FEATURES ALL CARE AND ANXIETY SEEMED REMOVED HER SPIRITS BECAME ALMOST TOO HIGH FOR CONTROL AND SHE CALLED HERSELF WITHOUT SCRUPLE
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW VEXED I AM I SHALL HAVE NO PLEASURE AT CLIFTON NOR IN ANYTHING ELSE I HAD RATHER TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER GET OUT NOW AND WALK BACK TO THEM HOW COULD YOU SAY YOU SAW THEM DRIVING OUT IN A PHAETON THORPE DEFENDED HIMSELF VERY STOUTLY
I AM COME TO BID YOU GOOD BYE CATHERINE WISHED HIM A GOOD JOURNEY WITHOUT APPEARING TO HEAR HER HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW FIDGETED ABOUT HUMMED A TUNE AND SEEMED WHOLLY SELF OCCUPIED
CATHERINE FELT THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN SAFER BUT ASHAMED OF AN IGNORANCE LITTLE EXPECTED SHE DARED NO LONGER CONTEST THE POINT NOR REFUSE TO HAVE BEEN AS FULL OF ARCH PENETRATION AND AFFECTIONATE SYMPATHY AS ISABELLA CHOSE TO CONSIDER HER
WELL PRAY DO NOT LET ANYBODY HERE BE A RESTRAINT ON YOU I DARE SAY WE COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT YOU BUT YOU MEN THINK YOURSELVES OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE CATHERINE COULD ALMOST HAVE ACCUSED ISABELLA OF BEING WANTING IN TENDERNESS TOWARDS HERSELF AND HER SORROWS
DEAR THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH WOULD BESET MY LIFE HAD APPEARED TO ME CLEARLY AS IN A VISION AND I WAS SINCERELY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF THE MAN I MARRIED NOW IN THE SOLITUDE OF A LIFE LIKE OURS
AND TRY TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT THE SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT I WAS UNDERTAKING FILLED ME AT FIRST WITH TERROR MARRIAGE IS A MATTER CONCERNING THE WHOLE OF LIFE WHILST LOVE AIMS ONLY AT PLEASURE
MY ONE JOY AND IT IS SUPREME SPRINGS FROM THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING BROUGHT NEW LIFE TO MY HUSBAND BEFORE I HAVE BORNE HIM ANY CHILDREN LOUIS HAS REGAINED HIS YOUTH STRENGTH AND SPIRITS HE IS NOT THE SAME MAN
AH MY LOVE BY THE ARDOR WITH WHICH HE EMBRACED MY PLANS I CAN GAUGE THE DEPTH OF HIS AFFECTION TO CONCLUDE HERE IS A LETTER HE WROTE ME YESTERDAY FROM MARSEILLES WHERE HE HAD GONE TO SPEND A FEW HOURS MY SWEET RENEE
A PROVENCAL LAD AND THE OLD WOMAN WHO USED TO WAIT ON HIS WIFE THE ROOMS ARE SCANTILY FURNISHED NEVERTHELESS THE HOUSE OF L'ESTORADE HAD DONE ITS BEST THE CUPBOARDS HAD BEEN RANSACKED AND ITS LAST MAN BEATEN UP FOR THE DINNER
THE FAVOR I AM ABOUT TO ASK FROM YOU WILL DEMAND UNSELFISHNESS ON YOUR PART FAR NOBLER THAN THE SERVITUDE TO WHICH A MAN'S LOVE WHEN SINCERE IS SUPPOSED TO REDUCE HIM THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU RISE TO THE HEIGHT OF FRIENDSHIP SUCH AS I UNDERSTAND IT
AND INVEST HER WITH AN EXHAUSTLESS POWER A REDUNDANCY OF LIFE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING BLOSSOM AROUND HER THE MORE SHE IS MISTRESS OF HERSELF THE MORE CERTAINLY WILL THE LOVE AND HAPPINESS SHE CREATES BE FIT TO WEATHER THE STORMS OF LIFE
AND MY CHILDREN IF I HAVE ANY WILL NOT BE RENT FROM ME THEY WILL BE MINE TO TRAIN AND MAKE MEN OF THE JOY OF MY LIFE IF YOU ALSO ARE TRUE TO YOUR DESTINY
WE SHALL TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN THE SILKWORMS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT OUR MULBERRY LEAVES WILL BE SOLD WE SHALL KNOW THE STRANGE VICISSITUDES OF LIFE IN PROVENCE AND THE STORMS THAT MAY ATTACK EVEN A PEACEFUL HOUSEHOLD
LIFE GIVES US BUT ONE FRIEND AND I WISH TO BE YOURS FRIENDSHIP IS THE BOND BETWEEN A PAIR OF KINDRED SOULS UNITED IN THEIR STRENGTH AND YET INDEPENDENT LET US BE FRIENDS AND COMRADES TO BEAR JOINTLY THE BURDEN OF LIFE
THIS DIFFICULTY THE FIRST WHICH HAS ARISEN IS THE ONLY ONE WHICH HAS DELAYED THE COMPLETION OF OUR MARRIAGE ALTHOUGH AT FIRST I MAY HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT ANYTHING RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT IT IS ONLY IN HUMAN NATURE
I FOUND MY ROOM ALMOST EXACTLY AS I LEFT IT
HAVING RENOUNCED ALL IDEA OF FINDING IN MARRIAGE THOSE TRANSPORTS OF LOVE ON WHICH OUR MINDS USED SO OFTEN AND WITH SUCH PERILOUS RAPTURE TO DWELL I FOUND A GENTLE CALM SETTLING OVER ME IF DEBARRED FROM LOVE
RETAINING PERFECT INDEPENDENCE WHAT COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE MORE HONORABLE A CONTRACT OF THIS KIND DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE LEGAL CONTRACT AND EVEN TO THE SACRAMENT ITSELF COULD BE CONCLUDED ONLY BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
AND OBTAINING FOR IT THE MAXIMUM OF PLEASURE WITH THE MINIMUM OF COST I HAVE ALREADY CONVINCED LOUIS OF THE NECESSITY OF GETTING ROADS MADE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY EARN THE REPUTATION OF A MAN INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF HIS DISTRICT
WHY NOT SEEK FOR HAPPINESS I SAID TO MYSELF MOREOVER I AM LOVED AND THE LOVE OFFERED ME I SHALL ACCEPT MY MARRIED LIFE WILL BE NO SLAVERY BUT RATHER A PERPETUAL REIGN
INFUSE WITH PASSION THEN IF YOU WILL THIS FRIENDSHIP AND LET THE VOICE OF LOVE DISTURB ITS CALM ON MY PART I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO BRING MY FEELINGS INTO ACCORD WITH YOURS ONE THING ABOVE ALL I WOULD BEG OF YOU
AND BEFORE LONG IT BECAME CLEAR THAT CHANCE HAD GIVEN ME FOR ADVERSARY ONE WHO WAS THE LESS FITTED FOR THE CONTEST BECAUSE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU MAGNILOQUENTLY CALL MY GREATNESS OF SOUL BROKEN BY SUFFERINGS AND MISFORTUNE
SO YOU MUST NARRATE TO ME IN FULL ALL YOUR ADVENTURES DESCRIBE YOUR BALLS AND PARTIES TELL ME WHAT YOU WEAR WHAT FLOWERS CROWN YOUR LOVELY GOLDEN LOCKS AND WHAT ARE THE WORDS AND MANNERS OF THE MEN YOU MEET
THE WHOLE STORY OF MY LIFE LIES BEFORE ME NOW ITS GREAT CRISES WILL BE THE TEETHING AND NUTRITION OF THE YOUNG MASTERS DE L'ESTORADE AND THE MISCHIEF THEY DO TO MY SHRUBS AND ME TO EMBROIDER THEIR CAPS
HE HOARDED HIS INCOME FOR HIM AND GUARDED CAREFULLY THE PORTION OF INHERITANCE WHICH FELL TO HIM
BUILT OF BIG ROUND PEBBLES SET IN LAYERS ALTERNATELY SLOPING OR UPRIGHT ACCORDING TO THE ARTISTIC TASTE OF THE MASON WHICH FINDS HERE ITS ONLY OUTLET THE MUD IN WHICH THEY ARE SET IS FALLING AWAY IN PLACES
THAT MY DESTINED HUSBAND WAS SLOWLY TRAVELING ON FOOT THROUGH RUSSIA POLAND AND GERMANY HIS BAD LUCK ONLY FORSOOK HIM AT BERLIN WHERE THE FRENCH MINISTER HELPED HIS RETURN TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
ONLY A SIMPLE COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING BENEATH ONE OF OUR HILLS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THAT NOBLE VALLEY THE PRIDE OF WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE THE BUILDING IS QUITE UNPRETENTIOUS FOUR PEBBLE WALLS COVERED WITH A YELLOWISH WASH
WHAT GRATITUDE COULD YOU FEEL TO ME LATER FOR A GIFT IN WHICH MY GOODWILL COUNTED FOR NOTHING IF DURING THE TIME THAT I REMAINED INDIFFERENT TO YOU YIELDING ONLY A PASSIVE OBEDIENCE SUCH AS MY MOTHER HAS JUST BEEN URGING ON ME A CHILD WERE BORN TO US
THE IMPORTANT POINT OF SEPARATING MARRIAGE FROM MARITAL RIGHTS WAS SETTLED IN A CONVERSATION BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE GAVE PROOF OF AN EXCELLENT TEMPER AND A TENDER HEART
WHOSE WORDS THRILLED ME AND ON WHOSE ARM I LEANT WITH PLEASURE BEYOND WORDS IN SHORT TO BE OPEN WITH YOU AS I WOULD BE WITH GOD BEFORE WHOM CONCEALMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE THE PERFECT LOYALTY WITH WHICH HE HAD KEPT HIS OATH MAY HAVE PIQUED ME
AND THAT I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED HIS FATHER SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOOK AFTER THE ESTATE AND PRACTISE ECONOMIES BECAUSE I WISHED HIM TO DEVOTE HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO POLITICS IF WE HAD CHILDREN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM ALL PROSPEROUS AND WITH GOOD STATE APPOINTMENTS
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESE THREE OBVIOUS DRAWBACKS MADE HIM DISTRUSTFUL OF HIMSELF HE DOUBTED HIS POWER TO MAKE ME HAPPY AND GUESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS
AFTER SUCCESSFULLY ELUDING THE CONSCRIPTION HE WAS FORCED TO SEND HIM TO THE ARMY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN TO JOIN THE EMPEROR'S BODYGUARD AFTER LEIPSIC NO MORE WAS HEARD OF HIM
IN A COUNTRY LIFE SUCH AS OURS WILL BE OUGHT WE NOT TO BEAR IN MIND THE EVANESCENT NATURE OF PASSION IS IT NOT SIMPLE PRUDENCE TO MAKE PROVISION BEFOREHAND AGAINST THE CALAMITIES INCIDENT TO CHANGE OF FEELING
AH DARLING MY LIFE UNROLLS ITSELF BEFORE MY EYES LIKE ONE OF THE GREAT HIGHWAYS OF FRANCE LEVEL AND EASY SHADED WITH EVERGREEN TREES THIS CENTURY WILL NOT SEE ANOTHER BONAPARTE
HUMBLE COUNTRY PLEASURES WILL ENLIVEN THE MONOTONY OF MY FUTURE IT SHALL BE MY AMBITION TO ENLARGE THE OASIS ROUND MY HOUSE AND TO GIVE IT THE LORDLY SHADE OF FINE TREES
HAVING GOT AN INCH TO ASK FOR AN ELL AND YOU AND I SWEET LOVE ARE OF THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE IT ALL I WATCHED LOUIS OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE AND PUT IT TO MYSELF HAS SUFFERING HAD A SOFTENING OR A HARDENING EFFECT ON HIM
WHICH ARE YOURS ALSO IN PERFECTION STILL LET ME SAY THAT THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING YOUR UNCHANGING BEAUTY ON WHICH TO FEAST MY EYES GIVES ME A JOY THAT GROWS WITH EVERY GLANCE THERE IS A GRACE AND DIGNITY IN THE LINES OF YOUR FACE
WHY SHOULD WE NOT BOTH BE LAUGHING AND GAY IN YOUR PARIS WHENCE I SHALL CARRY YOU OFF NOW AND AGAIN TO MY BEAUTIFUL OASIS IN PROVENCE OH LOUISE DON'T SPOIL THE SPLENDID FUTURE WHICH AWAITS US BOTH DON'T DO THE MAD THINGS WITH WHICH YOU THREATEN ME
A YEAR HENCE HIS STYLE WILL HAVE STILL FURTHER IMPROVED LOUIS IS NOW IN HIS FIRST TRANSPORT WHAT I LOOK FORWARD TO IS THE UNIFORM AND CONTINUOUS SENSATION OF CONTENT WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE FRUIT OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE
WE SAT FIVE IN THE ANTIQUATED CARRIAGE AND ARRIVED IN STATE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK THE DINNER WAS FOR THREE AT THE GRANGE WHICH IS THE DWELLING OF THE BARON DE L'ESTORADE MY FATHER IN LAW TO BE HAS YOU SEE NO CASTLE
THE FORCE THUS DEVELOPED AT ONCE IMPETUOUS AND ENDURING SIMPLE AND DIVERSIFIED BRINGS FORTH ULTIMATELY THE FAMILY THAT NOBLE PRODUCT OF WOMANHOOD WHICH I REALIZE NOW IN ALL ITS ANIMATING BEAUTY
PERHAPS SOME DAY THE COUNTRY DAME MAY GO AND SPEND A WINTER IN MARSEILLES BUT DANGER DOES NOT HAUNT THE PURLIEUS OF A NARROW PROVINCIAL STAGE THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO FEAR NOT EVEN AN ADMIRATION SUCH AS COULD ONLY MAKE A WOMAN PROUD
YOU WHO OUGHT TO FIND YOUR MATE AMONGST THE GREAT ONES OF THE EARTH THE CHILDREN OF YOUR RENEE WILL NOT LACK A ZEALOUS PROTECTRESS FAREWELL THEN FOR ME AT LEAST TO THE ROMANCES AND THRILLING ADVENTURES IN WHICH WE USED OURSELVES TO PLAY THE PART OF HEROINE
THAT LOUIS HAS SINCE CONFESSED TO ME THE ALARM IT CAUSED HIM TO FIND IN ME SO LITTLE OF THE IGNORANT MAIDEN THEN I LISTENED TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN REPLY HE GOT MIXED UP IN HIS ARGUMENTS AS PEOPLE DO WHEN HANDICAPPED BY FEAR
FOR HIS COQUETTISH WHITE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS BLUE ROOF GLITTERING IN THE SUN THE GARDEN AND SURROUNDING WALKS ARE HORRIBLY DUSTY AND THE TREES SEEM BURNT UP
WITH THE ADDITION OF THE FATHER'S SAVINGS
UNDER PENALTY THEREFORE OF FORFEITING MY ESTEEM AND AFFECTION HE MUST GET HIMSELF CHOSEN DEPUTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AT THE COMING ELECTIONS MY FAMILY WOULD SUPPORT HIS CANDIDATURE AND WE SHOULD THEN HAVE THE DELIGHT OF SPENDING ALL OUR WINTERS IN PARIS
ACT OR THINK WITHOUT ADDING TO THE ADMIRATION I FEEL FOR YOUR CHARM BOTH OF BODY AND MIND THERE IS IN YOU A RARE COMBINATION OF THE IDEAL THE PRACTICAL AND THE BEWITCHING WHICH SATISFIES ALIKE JUDGMENT A HUSBAND'S PRIDE DESIRE AND HOPE
OUR OWN IMPULSE SHALL WITH US ALONE DICTATE THE EXPRESSION OF FEELING WE SHALL BE FREE EVEN IN OUR FETTERS I SHALL HAVE THE MORE PRIDE IN WOOING YOU AGAIN NOW THAT I KNOW THE REWARD YOU PLACE ON VICTORY YOU CANNOT SPEAK BREATHE
I CAN'T TELL YOU ALL MY REASONS FOR THIS TO YOU ALONE SHALL I CONFIDE EVEN AS MUCH AS THIS I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN WHETHER PASSIONATELY LOVED OR NOT LOSE MUCH IN THEIR RELATION WITH THEIR HUSBANDS BY NOT CONCEALING THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT MARRIAGE AND THE WAY THEY LOOK AT IT
MY HAPPINESS WOULD WOUND HIM AND HAS TO BE CONCEALED HE IS SENSITIVE AS A WOMAN LIKE ALL MEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH FOR THREE MONTHS WE REMAINED AS WE WERE BEFORE MARRIAGE AS YOU MAY IMAGINE
BY DINT OF CONSTANT WATCHING I DISCOVERED HOW HIS MIND AND COUNTENANCE HARMONIZE THE ANIMAL THAT WE CALL A HUSBAND TO QUOTE YOUR WORDS DISAPPEARED AND ONE BALMY EVENING I DISCOVERED IN HIS STEAD A LOVER
OLD GENTLEMAN OF GOOD FAMILY WHO HAS MADE HIMSELF RICH AFTER THE PROVINCIAL FASHION BY SCRAPING AND PARING
DURING THIS TIME I MADE A CLOSE STUDY OF MANY SMALL PERSONAL MATTERS WHICH HAVE MORE TO DO WITH LOVE THAN IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED IN SPITE OF MY COLDNESS LOUIS GREW BOLDER AND HIS NATURE EXPANDED I SAW ON HIS FACE A NEW EXPRESSION
AND TO QUEEN IT IN PARIS YOUR POOR LITTLE SWEETHEART RENEE THAT CHILD OF THE DESERT HAS FALLEN FROM THE EMPYREAN WHITHER TOGETHER WE HAD SOARED INTO THE VULGAR REALITIES OF A LIFE AS HOMELY AS A DAISY'S
BY DINT OF CLOSE STUDY I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS LOVE AMOUNTED TO A PASSION ONCE TRANSFORMED INTO AN IDOL WHOSE SLIGHTEST FROWN WOULD TURN HIM WHITE AND TREMBLING I REALIZED THAT I MIGHT VENTURE ANYTHING
A LOOK OF YOUTH THE GREATER REFINEMENT WHICH I INTRODUCED INTO THE HOUSE WAS REFLECTED IN HIS PERSON INSENSIBLY I BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO HIS PRESENCE AND MADE ANOTHER SELF OF HIM
WHICH MY CHILDISH EYES USED TO SEE WITHOUT COMPREHENDING A FORTNIGHT AFTER MY ARRIVAL MY FATHER AND MOTHER TOOK ME ALONG WITH MY TWO BROTHERS TO DINE WITH ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS
MY TRADE WAS A SADDLER AND AS MY DEALINGS WERE CHIEFLY NOT BY A SHOP OR CHANCE TRADE BUT AMONG THE MERCHANTS TRADING TO THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA SO MY EFFECTS LAY VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF SUCH
WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
TO NOTE WHAT BECAME OF ME I HAD TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BEFORE ME
A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
IRRESOLUTE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I HAD SET THE EVENING WHOLLY APART TO CONSIDER SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT AND WAS ALL ALONE FOR ALREADY PEOPLE HAD AS IT WERE BY A GENERAL CONSENT
SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
AND IT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ESPECIALLY AND IN CLARKENWELL SO THAT BY THE SECOND WEEK IN AUGUST CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ALONE BURIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND CLARKENWELL
OF ALL DISTEMPERS WHEREOF IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DIED OF THE PLAGUE YET THERE WAS BUT TWENTY EIGHT IN THE WHOLE CITY WITHIN THE WALLS AND BUT NINETEEN IN SOUTHWARK
AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AND IN WHICH WAS EMBARKED ALL MY EFFECTS IN THE WORLD AND THE OTHER WAS THE PRESERVATION OF MY LIFE IN SO DISMAL A CALAMITY AS I SAW APPARENTLY WAS COMING UPON THE WHOLE CITY AND WHICH
AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOUGH THEY WERE AT FIRST IN A MOST INEXPRESSIBLE CONSTERNATION YET AS I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE DISTEMPER INTERMITTED OFTEN AT FIRST SO THEY WERE AS IT WERE
BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
I READ ON TO THE SEVENTH VERSE EXCLUSIVE AND AFTER THAT INCLUDED THE TENTH AS FOLLOWS I WILL SAY OF THE LORD HE IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS MY GOD
AND IT WAS PRINTED IN THE WEEKLY BILL OF MORTALITY IN THE USUAL MANNER THUS PLAGUE TWO PARISHES INFECTED ONE
ABOUT THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BEING FROM HEAVEN I MENTION THIS STORY ALSO AS THE BEST METHOD I CAN ADVISE ANY PERSON TO TAKE IN SUCH A CASE ESPECIALLY IF HE BE ONE THAT MAKES CONSCIENCE OF HIS DUTY
FLYING FROM GOD AND THAT HE COULD CAUSE HIS JUSTICE TO OVERTAKE ME WHEN AND WHERE HE THOUGHT FIT THESE THOUGHTS QUITE TURNED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN AND WHEN I CAME TO DISCOURSE WITH MY BROTHER AGAIN
ONLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT HIRE A HORSE TO GO OR MY FELLOW WAS RUN AWAY THAT WAS TO ATTEND ME WAS RIDICULOUS SINCE AT THE TIME I HAD MY HEALTH AND LIMBS AND OTHER SERVANTS AND MIGHT
AND HARDLY ANYTHING OF REFORMATION THOUGH THEY DID NOT WANT BEING TOLD THAT THEIR CRYING VICES MIGHT WITHOUT BREACH OF CHARITY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE FAR IN BRINGING THAT TERRIBLE JUDGEMENT UPON THE WHOLE NATION
IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AND THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN IN WHITECHAPPEL THAT IS TO SAY THE BROAD STREET WHERE I LIVED INDEED NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT WAGGONS AND CARTS WITH GOODS
THE WOMAN BEING TAKEN ILL WITH WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO ENTRUST MY HOUSE AND ALL MY AFFAIRS
I SAY AS MANY DID BECAUSE SEVERAL DID SO AT LAST ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ARMIES IN THE WAR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MANY YEARS PAST AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT SPEAKING OF SECOND CAUSES
BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
BUT THIS WAS ALL KNAVERY AND COLLUSION
AS ANYONE MIGHT PERCEIVE BY THEIR APPEARANCE THIS WAS A VERY TERRIBLE AND MELANCHOLY THING TO SEE AND AS IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT BUT LOOK ON FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
AND IT WAS MEET HE SHOULD DO WITH ME AS SHOULD SEEM GOOD TO HIM WITH THIS RESOLUTION I WENT TO BED
AS OTHERS RETIRED REALLY FRIGHTED WITH THE DISTEMPER IT WAS A MERE DESOLATING OF SOME OF THE STREETS BUT THE FRIGHT WAS NOT YET NEAR SO GREAT IN THE CITY ABSTRACTLY SO CALLED
SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
SO THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM EXTRAORDINARY AND I OUGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT DID NOT EVIDENTLY POINT OUT OR INTIMATE TO ME THAT IT WAS THE WILL OF HEAVEN I SHOULD NOT GO
A LITTLE HARDENED IT IS TRUE A VAST MANY PEOPLE FLED AS I HAVE OBSERVED YET THEY WERE CHIEFLY FROM THE WEST END OF THE TOWN AND FROM THAT WE CALL THE HEART OF THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY
BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
FOR IF ANY ONE COMPLAINED IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SAID HE HAD THE PLAGUE
YET THERE WAS FOURTEEN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER AS WELL AS FOURTEEN OF THE PLAGUE
MANUFACTURERS AND THE LIKE
IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
SAINT JAMES'S SEVEN
UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE WERE FIFTY DIED THAT WEEK OF THE PLAGUE THE NEXT BILL WAS FROM THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY TO THE THIRTIETH WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE PLAGUE WAS SEVENTEEN BUT
TWO PHYSICIANS AND A SURGEON WERE ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND MAKE INSPECTION THIS THEY DID AND FINDING EVIDENT TOKENS OF THE SICKNESS UPON BOTH THE BODIES THAT WERE DEAD
IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WRITTEN BY A CITIZEN WHO CONTINUED ALL THE WHILE IN LONDON NEVER MADE PUBLIC BEFORE
HAD MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT TRAVELLED DONE SO THE PLAGUE HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED INTO SO MANY COUNTRY TOWNS AND HOUSES AS IT WAS TO THE GREAT DAMAGE AND INDEED TO THE RUIN OF ABUNDANCE OF PEOPLE
HE WAS AS ABLE TO KEEP ME IN A TIME OF THE INFECTION AS IN A TIME OF HEALTH AND IF HE DID NOT THINK FIT TO DELIVER ME STILL I WAS IN HIS HANDS
THERE WAS NONE OF THE PLAGUE AND BUT FOUR OF THE SPOTTED FEVER BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT RETURNED AGAIN AND THE DISTEMPER WAS SPREAD INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER PARISHES
THAT IF I HAD BEEN A STRANGER AND AT A LOSS FOR MY WAY I MIGHT SOMETIMES HAVE GONE THE LENGTH OF A WHOLE STREET I MEAN OF THE BY STREETS AND SEEN NOBODY TO DIRECT ME
THAT ANY SHOULD HAVE HEARTS SO HARDENED IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A CALAMITY AS TO ROB AND STEAL YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT ALL SORTS OF VILLAINIES AND EVEN LEVITIES AND DEBAUCHERIES
I OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIM WHO HAVING BEEN MY MAKER HAD AN UNDISPUTED RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN DISPOSING OF ME AND THAT THEN THERE HAD BEEN
SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
BUT THEY WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT STREET NEITHER ON ONE SIDE
FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
BUT I HAD A FAMILY OF SERVANTS WHOM I KEPT AT MY BUSINESS HAD A HOUSE SHOP AND WAREHOUSES FILLED WITH GOODS AND IN SHORT TO LEAVE THEM ALL AS THINGS IN SUCH A CASE MUST BE LEFT THAT IS TO SAY
AND OF THE LAST THE BILL ITSELF SAID
THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR THE PLAGUE WAS TO RUN AWAY FROM IT AS TO MY ARGUMENT OF LOSING MY TRADE MY GOODS OR DEBTS HE QUITE CONFUTED ME HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING WHICH
SO FULLY BECAUSE I KNOW NOT BUT IT MAY BE OF MOMENT TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER ME IF THEY COME TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SAME DISTRESS AND TO THE SAME MANNER OF MAKING THEIR CHOICE AND THEREFORE
THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
AND AS ALL TOGETHER REGARD THE QUESTION BEFORE HIM AND THEN I THINK HE MAY SAFELY TAKE THEM FOR INTIMATIONS FROM HEAVEN OF WHAT IS HIS UNQUESTIONED DUTY TO DO IN SUCH A CASE I MEAN
AND AT THAT JUNCTURE I HAPPENED TO STOP TURNING OVER THE BOOK
AMONG THE WEALTHIEST OF THE PEOPLE AND SUCH PEOPLE AS WERE UNENCUMBERED WITH TRADES AND BUSINESS BUT OF THE REST THE GENERALITY STAYED AND SEEMED TO ABIDE THE WORST SO THAT
TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
AND AS I HAD ALREADY PREPARED EVERYTHING AS WELL AS I COULD AS TO MY BUSINESS AND WHOM TO ENTRUST MY AFFAIRS WITH I HAD LITTLE TO DO BUT TO RESOLVE I WENT HOME THAT EVENING GREATLY OPPRESSED IN MY MIND
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WENT TO OXFORD WHERE IT PLEASED GOD TO PRESERVE THEM AND THE DISTEMPER DID NOT AS I HEARD OF SO MUCH AS TOUCH THEM FOR WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT
THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
HIS COAT CLOSELY BUTTONED UP AND CONSTANTLY TAKING OUT HIS PENCIL
THE INCESSANT AND MELODIOUS WARBLING OF BIRDS AND THE ENTIRE REMOVAL FROM EITHER THE NOISE OF THE STREET OR THE BUSTLE OF THE MANSION ON THE EVENING OF ONE OF THE WARMEST DAYS SPRING HAD YET BESTOWED ON THE INHABITANTS OF PARIS
THAT I CAUSE NO SMALL DISTURBANCE IN YOUR HOUSE LOOK THERE SAID MAXIMILIAN LAUGHING THERE IS HER HUSBAND CHANGING HIS JACKET FOR A COAT
OH HEAVEN EXCLAIMED JULIE CLASPING HER HANDS IN WHAT DID HE BELIEVE THEN HE DID NOT CREDIT IT AT THE PERIOD WHICH I KNEW HIM SAID MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED TO THE HEART BY THE ACCENTS OF JULIE'S VOICE BUT PERHAPS SINCE THEN HE HAS HAD PROOFS THAT GRATITUDE DOES EXIST
AND THAT YOUR FATHER WAS RESOLVED UPON COMPLETING THE MATCH
SO I HAVE BECOME A GARDENER AND CONSEQUENTLY ADOPTED THE COSTUME OF MY CALLING WHAT EXCESSIVE NONSENSE YOU TALK MAXIMILIAN NONSENSE PRAY DO NOT CALL WHAT I CONSIDER THE WISEST ACTION OF MY LIFE BY SUCH A NAME
IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ME START WHEN YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY
CLAD IN A BLOUSE AND CAP A FAINT CRY OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SURPRISE ESCAPED FROM THE LIPS OF VALENTINE WHO ALMOST INSTANTLY SAID IN A SADDENED TONE AS THOUGH SOME ENVIOUS CLOUD DARKENED THE JOY WHICH ILLUMINED HER HEART
AND THE PURCHASER OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAVING PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR IT AND BEING QUITE UNABLE TO FIND ANY ONE WILLING TO TAKE HIS BARGAIN OFF HIS HANDS WITHOUT A CONSIDERABLE LOSS YET STILL CLINGING TO THE BELIEF THAT AT SOME FUTURE DAY HE SHOULD OBTAIN A SUM FOR IT THAT WOULD REPAY HIM
IF IT BE BUT TO CARRY AWAY WITH ME THE RECOLLECTION OF SUCH SWEET MOMENTS I COULD EVEN THANK YOU FOR CHIDING ME FOR IT LEAVES ME A GLEAM OF HOPE THAT IF YOU DID NOT EXPECT ME AND THAT INDEED WOULD BE WORSE THAN VANITY TO SUPPOSE
SAID A FEW HURRIED WORDS TO MADAME HERBAULT AND PRESSING THE HANDS OF EMMANUEL AND MAXIMILIAN MADAME SAID HE I TRUST YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO VISIT YOU OCCASIONALLY I VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND FEEL GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR WELCOME
OR IN OTHER WORDS PROJECTED A STREET AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN THE STREET WAS LAID OUT A NAME WAS CHOSEN AND POSTED UP ON AN IRON PLATE BUT BEFORE CONSTRUCTION WAS BEGUN
WHERE THE FOLIAGE BECAME SO THICK AS ALMOST TO SHUT OUT DAY A LARGE STONE BENCH AND SUNDRY RUSTIC SEATS INDICATED THAT THIS SHELTERED SPOT WAS EITHER IN GENERAL FAVOR OR PARTICULAR USE BY SOME INHABITANT OF THE HOUSE
AND MONSIEUR MAXIMILIAN MORREL WOULD SEE HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO CRIED MORREL THROWING AWAY HIS CIGAR AND HASTENING TO THE CARRIAGE I SHOULD THINK WE WOULD SEE HIM AH A THOUSAND THANKS COUNT FOR NOT HAVING FORGOTTEN YOUR PROMISE
HENCEFORTH WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR I AM ON MY OWN GROUND AND HAVE AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO PLACE A LADDER AGAINST THE WALL AND TO LOOK OVER WHEN I PLEASE WITHOUT HAVING ANY APPREHENSIONS OF BEING TAKEN OFF BY THE POLICE AS A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER
AND THIS DIAMOND WAS GIVEN BY THE GENEROUS UNKNOWN TO MY SISTER AS HER DOWRY MONTE CRISTO OPENED THE LETTER AND READ IT WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF DELIGHT IT WAS THE LETTER WRITTEN AS OUR READERS KNOW TO JULIE AND SIGNED SINBAD THE SAILOR
NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO I ONLY GUESSED I KNEW A LORD WILMORE WHO WAS CONSTANTLY DOING ACTIONS OF THIS KIND WITHOUT REVEALING HIMSELF HE WAS AN ECCENTRIC BEING AND DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF GRATITUDE
PARDON ME I HAD NO INTENTION OF COMMITTING AN INDISCRETION INDISCRETION OH YOU MAKE US HAPPY BY GIVING US AN EXCUSE FOR EXPATIATING ON THIS SUBJECT IF WE WANTED TO CONCEAL THE NOBLE ACTION THIS PURSE COMMEMORATES WE SHOULD NOT EXPOSE IT THUS TO VIEW
IF LORD WILMORE WAS YOUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR I FEAR YOU WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN I PARTED FROM HIM TWO YEARS AGO AT PALERMO AND HE WAS THEN ON THE POINT OF SETTING OUT FOR THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS SO THAT I FEAR HE WILL NEVER RETURN
AGAIN THE TIMID GIRL FOUND COURAGE TO RETURN TO THE GATE SAYING AS SHE DID SO AND WHY DO YOU COME SO LATE TO DAY IT IS ALMOST DINNER TIME AND I HAD TO USE NO LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO GET RID OF MY WATCHFUL MOTHER IN LAW MY TOO DEVOTED MAID AND MY TROUBLESOME BROTHER
THE WHOLE OF THE PROPERTY CONSISTING OF AN IMMENSE WORKSHOP TWO PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN AND THE GARDEN ITSELF HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY EMMANUEL WHO HAD SEEN AT A GLANCE THAT HE COULD MAKE OF IT A PROFITABLE SPECULATION
AND WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN HAS TAKEN THIS METHOD OF REQUITING THE OBLIGATION EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN THIS AFFAIR EVEN A MIRACLE WHAT WAS HIS NAME ASKED MONTE CRISTO HE GAVE NO OTHER NAME ANSWERED JULIE LOOKING EARNESTLY AT THE COUNT
I KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND AS YOU WISHED AND WAITED NOT FOR THE DECISION OF YOUR HEART OR MY OWN
BUT LISTEN TO ME VALENTINE AND I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT I BECAME WEARY OF RANGING FIELDS AND SCALING WALLS AND SERIOUSLY ALARMED AT THE IDEA SUGGESTED BY YOU THAT IF CAUGHT HOVERING ABOUT HERE YOUR FATHER WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE ME SENT TO PRISON AS A THIEF
WAS ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED IN THE CHOICE BY THE ABSENCE OF ALL GLARE THE COOL REFRESHING SHADE THE SCREEN IT AFFORDED FROM THE SCORCHING RAYS OF THE SUN THAT FOUND NO ENTRANCE THERE EVEN DURING THE BURNING DAYS OF HOTTEST SUMMER
ENDEAVORING TO DISCERN SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE BY MEANS OF THE OPENINGS IN THE PLANKS THE EARNESTNESS OF HER ATTITUDE AND THE FIXED GAZE WITH WHICH SHE SEEMED TO SEEK THE OBJECT OF HER WISHES PROVING HOW MUCH HER FEELINGS WERE INTERESTED IN THE MATTER
I HAVE CHOSEN A TRADE A TRADE OH MAXIMILIAN HOW CAN YOU JEST AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SUCH DEEP CAUSE FOR UNEASINESS HEAVEN KEEP ME FROM JESTING WITH THAT WHICH IS FAR DEARER TO ME THAN LIFE ITSELF
FOR HE HAS DONE FOR US WHAT HE GRANTS ONLY TO HIS CHOSEN HE SENT US ONE OF HIS ANGELS
SUCH FELICITY SEEMS ABOVE ALL PRICE AS A THING IMPOSSIBLE AND UNATTAINABLE BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I PURCHASE ALL THIS DELIGHT JOY AND HAPPINESS
A FEW LOCKS OF GRAY MINGLED WITH HIS HAIR WHICH WAS STILL THICK AND MATTED WHILE HIS BRONZED FEATURES AND DETERMINED GLANCE WELL SUITED AN OLD SAILOR WHO HAD BRAVED THE HEAT OF THE EQUATOR AND THE STORMS OF THE TROPICS I THINK YOU HAILED ME
IS IT NOT WORTH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS TO SAVE OUR FATHER'S NAME FROM THE CHANCES OF EVIL FORTUNE AND FAILURE
BUT SUCH AS WE ARE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BITTER SORROWS AND GOD HAS POURED BALM INTO YOUR WOUNDS AS HE DOES INTO THOSE OF ALL WHO ARE IN AFFLICTION SAID MONTE CRISTO INQUIRINGLY YES COUNT RETURNED JULIE WE MAY INDEED SAY HE HAS
IN WHICH HE OFFERS TO PURCHASE THE GOOD WILL OF THE HOUSE TO UNITE WITH HIS OWN FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ADVISE ME WHAT I HAD BETTER DO
FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL ME DID YOU KNOW THIS ENGLISHMAN BUT YOU TELL ME ALSO THAT THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAVE CONSTANTLY DENIED HAVING RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE YES THEN IS IT NOT PROBABLE THAT THIS ENGLISHMAN MAY BE SOME ONE WHO GRATEFUL FOR A KINDNESS YOUR FATHER HAD SHOWN HIM
NOT ONLY FOR HIS PAST OUTLAY BUT ALSO THE INTEREST UPON THE CAPITAL LOCKED UP IN HIS NEW ACQUISITION CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH LETTING THE GROUND TEMPORARILY TO SOME MARKET GARDENERS AT A YEARLY RENTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
THEY ARE YOUNG AND CHEERFUL THEY ARE TENDERLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER AND WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR THEY FANCY THEMSELVES AS RICH AS ROTHSCHILD FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS IS NOT A LARGE SUM HOWEVER REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
MADEMOISELLE JULIE SAID HE PENELON HAD STILL PRESERVED THE HABIT OF CALLING HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER MADEMOISELLE JULIE AND HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THE NAME TO MADAME HERBAULT
THE CARRIAGES THAT DROVE UP TO THE DOOR WERE COMPELLED TO TURN TO AVOID A FOUNTAIN THAT PLAYED IN A BASIN OF ROCKWORK AN ORNAMENT THAT HAD EXCITED THE JEALOUSY OF THE WHOLE QUARTER
MY FATHER THOUGHT THAT THIS ACTION HAD BEEN MIRACULOUSLY PERFORMED HE BELIEVED THAT A BENEFACTOR HAD ARISEN FROM THE GRAVE TO SAVE US OH IT WAS A TOUCHING SUPERSTITION MONSIEUR AND ALTHOUGH I DID NOT MYSELF BELIEVE IT I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD HAVE DESTROYED MY FATHER'S FAITH
WHO IS ALWAYS TEASING ME ABOUT COMING TO WORK AT MY EMBROIDERY WHICH I AM IN A FAIR WAY NEVER TO GET DONE SO PRAY EXCUSE YOURSELF AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR HAVING MADE ME WAIT AND AFTER THAT TELL ME WHY I SEE YOU IN A DRESS SO SINGULAR THAT AT FIRST I DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU
WITH ITS THICKLY PLANTED COURT YARD OPENING INTO THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE AND TO THE GARDEN SHUT IN BY THIS GATE WHICH FORMERLY COMMUNICATED WITH A FINE KITCHEN GARDEN OF ABOUT AN ACRE FOR THE DEMON OF SPECULATION DREW A LINE
BUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR HAS HAD A MYSTERIOUS MEANING THAT WE CANNOT COMPREHEND WE HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND A HAND AS POWERFUL AS THAT OF AN ENCHANTER OH CRIED JULIE I HAVE NOT LOST ALL HOPE OF SOME DAY KISSING THAT HAND AS I NOW KISS THE PURSE WHICH HE HAS TOUCHED
BUT THE STRICT DECORUM AND RIGID PROPRIETY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE LEFT NO GROUNDS FOR APPREHENDING THAT ADVANTAGE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HORTICULTURE SEEMED HOWEVER TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED IN THE DESERTED KITCHEN GARDEN
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY AFFECTING THE GROWTH OF OTHER LUXURIANT SHRUBS AND FLOWERS THAT EAGERLY DRESSED FORWARD TO FILL UP THE VACANT SPACES AS THOUGH ASSERTING THEIR RIGHT TO ENJOY THE BOON OF LIGHT AND AIR AT ONE CORNER
AS THEY WAVED THEIR VARIEGATED LEAVES IN THE WIND AND CHARMED THE EYE WITH THEIR SCARLET BLOOM HAD FALLEN INTO UTTER DISUSE THE PROPRIETORS OF THE MANSION HAD MANY YEARS BEFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THE POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE ITSELF
SAW ON THE QUAY AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS ON THE POINT OF EMBARKING ON BOARD A YACHT AND HE RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE PERSON WHO CALLED ON MY FATHER THE FIFTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE AND WHO WROTE ME THIS LETTER ON THE FIFTH OF SEPTEMBER HE FELT CONVINCED OF HIS IDENTITY BUT HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ADDRESS HIM
DOOMED TO WANT AND WRETCHEDNESS CAN AT PRESENT HEAR EVERY ONE ENVYING OUR HAPPY LOT THIS LETTER AS HE SPOKE MAXIMILIAN DREW A LETTER FROM THE PURSE AND GAVE IT TO THE COUNT THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY HIM THE DAY THAT MY FATHER HAD TAKEN A DESPERATE RESOLUTION
HE MEANS THAT THE ARTICLES CONTAINED IN THIS PURSE ARE THE RELICS OF THE ANGEL I SPOKE OF JUST NOW THIS I DO NOT COMPREHEND AND YET I MAY NOT ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BOWING
LISTEN TO ME OUR HOUSE TRANSACTS BUSINESS TO THE AMOUNT OF A MILLION A YEAR FROM WHICH WE DERIVE AN INCOME OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS
THAT COMPLETES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS WE HAD FIXED AS THE LIMITS OF OUR GAINS
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO STOP THE ISSUE OF ANY MORE AND CLOSE OUR OFFICE THIS WAS DONE INSTANTLY IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AT A QUARTER PAST A MERCHANT PRESENTED HIMSELF TO INSURE TWO SHIPS IT WAS A CLEAR PROFIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
UNKNOWN YOU SAY IS THE MAN WHO RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE UNKNOWN TO YOU YES WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE HAPPINESS OF PRESSING HIS HAND CONTINUED MAXIMILIAN WE HAVE SUPPLICATED HEAVEN IN VAIN TO GRANT US THIS FAVOR
COME COME SAID MAXIMILIAN I WILL SERVE AS YOUR GUIDE SUCH A MAN AS YOU ARE OUGHT NOT TO BE INTRODUCED BY A SERVANT MY SISTER IS IN THE GARDEN PLUCKING THE DEAD ROSES MY BROTHER IS READING HIS TWO PAPERS THE PRESSE AND THE DEBATS WITHIN SIX STEPS OF HER
HE WAS MY FRIEND HE HAD NO SECRETS FROM ME AND IF THIS HAD BEEN SO HE WOULD HAVE CONFIDED IN ME AND HE TOLD YOU NOTHING NOT A WORD NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO SUPPOSE NOTHING AND YET YOU SPOKE OF HIM AT ONCE AH IN SUCH A CASE ONE SUPPOSES
AND WHERE CABBAGES CARROTS RADISHES PEASE AND MELONS HAD ONCE FLOURISHED A SCANTY CROP OF LUCERNE ALONE BORE EVIDENCE OF ITS BEING DEEMED WORTHY OF CULTIVATION
OH WOULD WE COULD RELATE IT EVERYWHERE AND TO EVERY ONE SO THAT THE EMOTION OF OUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR MIGHT REVEAL HIS PRESENCE
A FRIEND LOST TO HIM FOREVER AND ON HIS DEATH BED WHEN THE NEAR APPROACH OF ETERNITY SEEMED TO HAVE ILLUMINED HIS MIND WITH SUPERNATURAL LIGHT THIS THOUGHT WHICH HAD UNTIL THEN BEEN BUT A DOUBT BECAME A CONVICTION AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE MAXIMILIAN IT WAS EDMOND DANTES
A SMALL LOW DOOR GAVE EGRESS FROM THE WALLED SPACE WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING INTO THE PROJECTED STREET THE GROUND HAVING BEEN ABANDONED AS UNPRODUCTIVE BY ITS VARIOUS RENTERS
RECOLLECT WHAT OUR EXCELLENT FATHER SO OFTEN TOLD US IT WAS NO ENGLISHMAN THAT THUS SAVED US MONTE CRISTO STARTED
INTO THE LARGE STONE VASES THAT STOOD UPON THE TWO SQUARE PILASTERS OF A CURIOUSLY WROUGHT IRON GATE
I SHALL LOOK LIKE SOME RETIRED BAKER THAT IS WHAT I WANT COME IF YOU WILL ONLY PUT THIS SCHEME INTO EXECUTION AND BE STEADY NOTHING COULD BE BETTER
DO YOU THINK SO M BOSSUET AND YOU
I THOUGHT YOU WERE EARNING A LIVING IN TUSCANY OR PIEDMONT BY ACTING AS FACCHINO OR CICERONE AND I PITIED YOU SINCERELY AS I WOULD A CHILD OF MY OWN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS DID CALL YOU MY CHILD
AND HAD RETURNED JUST AS THEY WERE STARTING BUT INSTEAD OF EITHER OF THESE HE SAW NOTHING BUT A STRANGE FACE SUNBURNT AND ENCIRCLED BY A BEARD WITH EYES BRILLIANT AS CARBUNCLES
WHO TAKING THEM FROM HIM RESTED HIS POLISHED BOOT LIGHTLY ON THE STEP AT THAT MOMENT A HAND TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER THE YOUNG MAN TURNED ROUND
THERE TAKE A CAB THAT YOU MAY NOT BE TOO LATE THE SURPRISED GROOM RETIRED LET ME AT LEAST REACH A SHADY SPOT SAID ANDREA OH AS FOR THAT
ANDREA LOOKED AROUND IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD AND THEN STOPPING THE HORSE AND CROSSING HIS ARMS BEFORE THE MAN HE ASKED NOW
SO FAR I HAVE APPEARED TO ANSWER HIS PURPOSE AND WHO FOUND THIS FATHER FOR YOU THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
I CHOSE MY OPPORTUNITY THAT I MIGHT NOT COMPROMISE YOU
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT YOU COME TO PARIS HOW DOES THAT ANNOY YOU IT DOES NOT ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT WILL ANSWER MY PURPOSE SO SAID ANDREA
LET ME ASK YOU WHY YOU DECEIVED ME HOW HAVE I DECEIVED YOU HOW DO YOU ASK
A REAL FATHER YES SO LONG AS HE PAYS ME YOU'LL HONOR AND BELIEVE HIM THAT'S RIGHT WHAT IS HIS NAME MAJOR CAVALCANTI
I ONLY WISH TO SAY TWO OR THREE WORDS TO YOUR MASTER WHO GAVE ME A COMMISSION TO EXECUTE ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO COME SAID ANDREA WITH SUFFICIENT NERVE FOR HIS SERVANT NOT TO PERCEIVE HIS AGITATION WHAT DO YOU WANT
SINCE HE HOLDS THE MONEY CHEST WELL I WILL MENTION YOU TO HIM MEANWHILE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
AND GOOD BY TO MY DREAM OF RESEMBLING THE RETIRED BAKER NO NO MY BOY I PREFER REMAINING HONORABLY IN THE CAPITAL ANDREA SCOWLED CERTAINLY
WELL I SHALL RENT A ROOM IN SOME RESPECTABLE HOUSE WEAR A DECENT COAT SHAVE EVERY DAY AND GO AND READ THE PAPERS IN A CAFE THEN IN THE EVENING I SHALL GO TO THE THEATRE
RAGS ON MY BACK AND WORN OUT SHOES ON MY FEET YOU WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN ME YOU WRONG ME MY BOY NOW I HAVE FOUND YOU NOTHING PREVENTS MY BEING AS WELL DRESSED AS ANY ONE KNOWING AS I DO
THE MAN WHOSE HOUSE YOU HAVE JUST LEFT YES
WERE SO FULL OF AFFABILITY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HANDS EVEN WITH THE BANKER'S SERVANTS SO MUCH DID THEIR GRATITUDE NEED AN OBJECT TO EXPEND ITSELF UPON ONE THING ABOVE ALL THE REST HEIGHTENED THE RESPECT
SAID THE GROOM ENDEAVORING TO RID HIS MASTER OF THE TROUBLESOME INTRUDER I AM NOT BEGGING MY FINE FELLOW SAID THE UNKNOWN TO THE SERVANT WITH SO IRONICAL AN EXPRESSION OF THE EYE AND SO FRIGHTFUL A SMILE THAT HE WITHDREW
THERE NOW AGAIN YOU DEGRADE ME HOW SO BY MAKING ME APPLY TO THE SERVANTS WHEN I WANT TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH YOU ALONE WELL BE IT SO THEN
HE ASKED PARDON ME MY FRIEND IF I DISTURB YOU SAID THE MAN WITH THE RED HANDKERCHIEF BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BEG AT NIGHT
IT IS SO WINDY THAT YOUR HAT CAN EASILY APPEAR TO HAVE BLOWN OFF COME COME ENOUGH OF THIS SAID CAVALCANTI
AS YOU SAID JUST NOW YOU ARE A NATIVE OF MARSEILLES I AM DO YOU KNOW THEN NOW WHAT YOU ARE NO BUT I WAS BROUGHT UP IN CORSICA YOU ARE OLD AND OBSTINATE
WITH HIS UNPLEASANT SMILE IT WAS VERY POLITE OF YOU COME SAID ANDREA WHAT DO YOU WANT YOU DO NOT SPEAK AFFECTIONATELY TO ME BENEDETTO MY OLD FRIEND
YOU SPEAK TO ME BEFORE MY SERVANT HOW CAN I HELP THAT MY BOY I SPEAK TO YOU WHEN I CAN CATCH YOU YOU HAVE A QUICK HORSE A LIGHT TILBURY
THEN AFTER DINNER ON THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS HE QUESTIONED THE FATHER AND SON UPON THEIR MODE OF LIVING AND THE FATHER AND SON PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THROUGH DANGLARS THE ONE WAS TO RECEIVE HIS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
THAT YOU ARE MISTAKEN WELL WELL DON'T BE ANGRY MY BOY YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHAT IT IS TO BE UNFORTUNATE AND MISFORTUNES MAKE US JEALOUS
HAS BEEN KIND TO ME FORTUNE HAS BEEN KIND TO YOU THEN YOUR TILBURY YOUR GROOM YOUR CLOTHES ARE NOT THEN HIRED GOOD
AS HE HAD HIMSELF OWNED THE REPUTED SON OF MAJOR CAVALCANTI WAS A WILFUL FELLOW HE DREW UP FOR A MINUTE THREW A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM AND THEN HIS HAND FELL INSTANTLY INTO HIS POCKET
WHO HAD NEVER TAKEN HIS EYES OFF HIS COMPANION PASSED HIS HAND BEHIND HIS BACK AND OPENED A LONG SPANISH KNIFE WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED WITH HIM TO BE READY IN CASE OF NEED
AMONGST WHOM WITH DILATING EYES HE SAW THE KING'S ATTORNEY THEN HE HAD BEEN SEIZED UPON BY DANGLARS WHO WITH A RAPID GLANCE AT THE STIFF NECKED OLD MAJOR AND HIS MODEST SON
AND A SMILE UPON THE MOUTH WHICH DISPLAYED A PERFECT SET OF WHITE TEETH POINTED AND SHARP AS THE WOLF'S OR JACKAL'S A RED HANDKERCHIEF ENCIRCLED HIS GRAY HEAD
I CAN SCARCELY STAND THE YOUNG MAN SHUDDERED AT THIS STRANGE FAMILIARITY TELL ME HE SAID TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT WELL THEN
WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THE SIGNAL OF DEPARTURE HE OFFERED A SEAT IN HIS LANDAU TO MADAME DANGLARS THAT SHE MIGHT BE UNDER THE CARE OF HIS WIFE
AT THIS NAME NO DOUBT THE YOUNG MAN REFLECTED A LITTLE FOR HE WENT TOWARDS HIS GROOM SAYING THIS MAN IS RIGHT I DID INDEED CHARGE HIM WITH A COMMISSION THE RESULT OF WHICH HE MUST TELL ME WALK TO THE BARRIER
THE TWO FRIENDS AS WE SEE WERE WORTHY OF AND UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER ANDREA'S HAND LEFT HIS POCKET INOFFENSIVELY AND WAS CARRIED UP TO THE RED MUSTACHE WHICH IT PLAYED WITH FOR SOME TIME
HE HAD NOTICED THE APPROACH OF VILLEFORT TO MADAME DANGLARS AND HE SOON GUESSED ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THOUGH THE WORDS HAD BEEN UTTERED IN SO LOW A VOICE
WHERE IT BEGAN PLAYING WITH A PISTOL BUT MEANWHILE
BUT TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT WHY DO YOU WISH TO KNOW ASKED CAVALCANTI WHAT DO YOU AGAIN DEFY ME NO THE FACT IS I HAVE FOUND MY FATHER WHAT
WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE MAKING IN ALL ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FRANCS WHY I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE ARRESTED AT THE BARRIERS THEN TO JUSTIFY MYSELF I SHOULD SAY THAT YOU GAVE ME THE MONEY
HIS EYES SPARKLING WITH AVARICE OH YOU KNEW THAT WELL ENOUGH BEFORE SPEAKING TO ME SAID ANDREA BECOMING MORE AND MORE EXCITED IF I HAD BEEN WEARING A HANDKERCHIEF LIKE YOURS ON MY HEAD
COME COME WHAT THEN PATIENCE PATIENCE I AM PATIENT BUT GO ON
DANGLARS THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT SUCH LUXURIES WERE COMMON AT THE TABLE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS DESCENDANT OF THE CAVALCANTI WHO MOST LIKELY IN LUCCA FED UPON TROUT BROUGHT FROM SWITZERLAND AND LOBSTERS SENT FROM ENGLAND
NAY ALMOST THE VENERATION OF DANGLARS FOR CAVALCANTI THE LATTER FAITHFUL TO THE PRINCIPLE OF HORACE NIL ADMIRARI HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SHOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE
AND WHICH WAS THE FIRST THING ANDREA SAW SEEMED OF GIGANTIC SIZE DID THE YOUNG MAN RECOGNIZE THAT FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN IN HIS TILBURY
THE EVENING PASSED ON MADAME DE VILLEFORT EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO RETURN TO PARIS WHICH MADAME DANGLARS HAD NOT DARED TO DO NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNEASINESS SHE EXPERIENCED ON HIS WIFE'S REQUEST M DE VILLEFORT
BUT THAT WITH WITH WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FRANCS I SHOULD BE QUITE HAPPY HERE ARE TWO HUNDRED SAID ANDREA
OR WAS HE MERELY STRUCK WITH THE HORRIBLE APPEARANCE OF HIS INTERROGATOR WE CANNOT SAY BUT ONLY RELATE THE FACT THAT HE SHUDDERED AND STEPPED BACK SUDDENLY
COME STEP IN SAID THE YOUNG MAN IT WAS A PITY THIS SCENE HAD NOT OCCURRED IN DAYLIGHT FOR IT WAS CURIOUS TO SEE THIS RASCAL THROWING HIMSELF HEAVILY DOWN ON THE CUSHION BESIDE THE YOUNG AND ELEGANT DRIVER OF THE TILBURY
HE ASSUMED THE CARELESS ATTITUDE OF A SERVANT WHOSE MASTER DRIVES HIMSELF BUT TELL ME SAID ANDREA
WHO WAS MORE AND MORE CHARMED WITH THE IDEAS OF ORDER AND ECONOMY WHICH RULED THIS MAN AND YET WHO BEING ABLE TO ALLOW HIS SON SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
THIS WOULD CAUSE INQUIRIES IT WOULD BE FOUND THAT I LEFT TOULON WITHOUT GIVING DUE NOTICE AND I SHOULD THEN BE ESCORTED BACK TO THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN THEN I SHOULD BECOME SIMPLY
WE SHALL SEE HE THEN TOOK THE GREAT COAT WITH THE LARGE COLLAR WHICH THE GROOM HAD LEFT BEHIND IN THE TILBURY AND PUT IT ON HIS BACK THEN HE TOOK OFF CAVALCANTI'S HAT WHICH HE PLACED UPON HIS OWN HEAD AND FINALLY
I AM YOUNG AND WILFUL BETWEEN PEOPLE LIKE US THREATS ARE OUT OF PLACE EVERYTHING SHOULD BE AMICABLY ARRANGED IS IT MY FAULT IF FORTUNE
WITHOUT OPPOSING THEIR ARRANGEMENTS HE ALLOWED MORREL CHATEAU RENAUD AND DEBRAY TO LEAVE ON HORSEBACK AND THE LADIES IN M DE VILLEFORT'S CARRIAGE DANGLARS MORE AND MORE DELIGHTED WITH MAJOR CAVALCANTI
WELL SAID ANDREA
HAD OFFERED HIM A SEAT IN HIS CARRIAGE ANDREA CAVALCANTI FOUND HIS TILBURY WAITING AT THE DOOR THE GROOM IN EVERY RESPECT A CARICATURE OF THE ENGLISH FASHION
DON'T THINK I WANT THE GLORY OF RIDING IN YOUR FINE CARRIAGE SAID HE OH NO IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I AM TIRED AND ALSO BECAUSE I HAVE A LITTLE BUSINESS TO TALK OVER WITH YOU
I WOULD NOT GIVE MUCH FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU TRIED TO FIND THE WAY ALONE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WHEN YOU GOT ME OFF FROM BEING HUNG AFTER THAT LITTLE AFFAIR AT BRUGES
THAT WALTER WONDERED WHAT BUSINESS THERE MIGHT BE SCARCELY KNOWING WHY HE DID SO WALTER THREW HIMSELF DOWN AMONG SOME LOW BRUSHWOOD AND WATCHED THE APPROACHING FIGURE WHEN HE CAME NEAR
IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD TAKE HIM SOME DAY AS HIS PARTNER IN THE FORGE AFTER WORK WAS OVER AND THE MEN HAD GONE AWAY
OF DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF THOSE WHO RIDE WITH HIM MAY BE CERTAIN OF A CHANCE OF DOING VALOROUS DEEDS I WILL GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE TOMORROW AND WILL HAVE A TALK WITH MASTER FLETCHER THE SOONER YOU ARE APPRENTICED
A PLAIN STONE WITH THE NAME DAME ALICE SOMERS MARKING THE GRAVE THE BOY GREW AND THROVE UNTIL AT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD THERE WAS NO STRONGER OR STURDIER LAD OF HIS AGE WITHIN THE CITY BOUNDS
OFTTIMES GROWING INTO EARNEST WERE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE LADS OF THE DIFFERENT WARDS WALTER FLETCHER AS HE WAS KNOWN AMONG HIS PLAY FELLOWS
TEACH HIM TO BE HONEST AND TRUE IT WERE BETTER METHINKS THAT HE GREW UP THINKING YOU HIS FATHER AND MOTHER FOR OTHERWISE HE MAY GROW DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT
HER BROTHER WHO BUT A YEAR AGO BECAME LORD OF BROOMECASTLE AT THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THE QUEEN'S MEN AND IT WAS HE I BELIEVE WHO BROUGHT SIR ROLAND SOMERS TO THAT SIDE HE WAS SLAIN ON THE SAME NIGHT AS MORTIMER
THE HOUR IS LATE AND I SHALL BE HAVING THE WATCH COMING ALONG TO KNOW WHY I KEEP A FIRE SO LONG AFTER THE CURFEW SHOULD YOU BE A STRANGER IN THE CITY
THAT HE RAPIDLY ACQUIRED THEIR USE AND GEOFFREY FORESAW THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY SHOULD HIS THOUGHTS TURN THAT WAY PROVE A MIGHTY MAN AT ARMS
I AM ROUGH AND HEEDLESS IN SPEECH AS MY SISTER MADGE DOES OFTEN TELL ME AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT I HAVE SAID SOMETHING WHICH WOUNDED YOU
WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT AUGHT LAY AMONG THEM IN THE CENTRE HOWEVER THE GROUND HAD BEEN CUT AWAY AND A LOW DOORWAY ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE BUSHES GAVE ACCESS INTO A HALF SUBTERRANEAN HUT
HE MOVES NOT LIFT HIS HEAD FROM THE GROUND THE BOY WAS INDEED STILL INSENSIBLE MY LORDS THE PRINCE SAID TO THE KNIGHTS WHO HAD NOW RIDDEN UP I FEAR THAT THIS BOY IS BADLY HURT
HE HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE FIGHTS AND FROLICS OF HIS FORMER COMRADES HE WAS IN FACT FAR TOO TIRED AT THE END OF HIS DAY'S WORK TO HAVE ANY DESIRE TO DO AUGHT BUT TO SIT AND LISTEN TO THE TALES OF THE WARS
SINCE SEARCHERS COULD BE SEEN APPROACHING A LONG WAY OFF AND ESCAPE COULD BE MADE BY PATHS ACROSS THE SWAMP
SHE LEANT AGAINST THE WALL WITH A FAINT GROAN OF EXHAUSTION AND DISAPPOINTMENT
AND IN TROTH MASTER WARD METHINKS THAT GOD WOULD DEAL MOST GENTLY WITH HER
AND GENTLY AS BECOMES ONE OF GOOD BLOOD A FEW DAYS LATER LADY ALICE BREATHED HER LAST AND AT HER OWN REQUEST WAS BURIED QUIETLY AND WITHOUT POMP AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD OF THE BOWMAN
THOUGH HARDLY PRESSED ON ALL SIDES
AND NOW MADAM I AM AT YOUR SERVICE DURING THE NIGHT THE WAYFARER'S CLOTHES HAD BEEN DRIED THE CLOAK WAS OF ROUGH QUALITY SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED BY A PEASANT WOMAN BUT THE REST THOUGH OF SOMBRE COLOUR WERE OF GOOD MATERIAL AND FASHION
THAT MEN WHO HAVE DONE NO OTHER HARM SHOULD BE BEHEADED STILL LESS THAT THEIR HEADS AND LIMBS SHOULD BE STUCK UP THERE GIBBERING AT ALL PASSERS BY THERE ARE OVER A SCORE OF THEM AND EVERY FRESH TROUBLE ADDS TO THEIR NUMBER BUT PARDON ME
WALTER SAW A FIGURE APPEAR ABOVE SOME BUSHES SOME FOUR HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT THE KNIGHT AT ONCE DIRECTED HIS STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION AND WALTER CREPT CAUTIOUSLY AFTER HIM A PEST UPON THESE SWAMPS AND QUAGMIRES THE KNIGHT SAID ANGRILY AS HE NEARED THE OTHER
I THANK YOU INDEED SHE SAID FOR YOUR KINDNESS HAD YOU NOT TAKEN ME IN I THINK I WOULD HAVE DIED AT YOUR DOOR FOR INDEED I COULD GO NO FURTHER AND THOUGH I HOLD NOT TO LIFE YET WOULD I FAIN LIVE UNTIL I HAVE DELIVERED MY BOY
THE RUMOURS THAT WE ARE LIKELY ERE LONG TO HAVE WAR WITH FRANCE HAVE RARELY BETTERED MY TRADE SINCE THE WARS IN SCOTLAND MEN'S ARMS HAVE RUSTED SOMEWHAT
THE SOONER YOU WILL BE OUT OF YOUR TIME AND SINCE MADGE MARRIED EIGHT YEARS SINCE I HAVE BEEN LONELY IN THE HOUSE AND SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH ME GEOFFREY WARD FOUND HIS FRIEND MORE READY TO ACCEDE TO HIS REQUEST
CROSS LONDON BRIDGE AND WOULD SPEND HOURS IN THE ARMOURER'S FORGE
AND INDEED NOT A FEW WERE THE COMPLAINTS WHICH WERE BROUGHT BEFORE GILES FLETCHER OF BRUISES AND HURTS CAUSED BY HIM YOU ARE TOO TURBULENT WALTER THE BOWYER SAID ONE DAY WHEN A HABERDASHER FROM THE WARD OF ALDERSGATE CAME TO COMPLAIN
HE SHOULD LONG TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN THE FIELD HE SAID NOTHING OF THIS HOWEVER BUT RENEWED HIS PROMISE TO SPEAK TO GILES FLETCHER
WHAT IS THY NAME GOOD LAD THE PRINCE ASKED I AM KNOWN AS WALTER FLETCHER YOU ARE A BRAVE LAD THE PRINCE SAID AND IF YOU BEAR YOU AS WELL AS A MAN AS YOU DID BUT NOW
FOR NONE WOULD SUSPECT THAT THERE WAS A HUMAN HABITATION AMONG THESE BROWN DITCHES AND STAGNANT POOLS TO HIS DISAPPOINTMENT THE LAD COULD HEAR NOTHING OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH WAS GOING ON WITHIN THE HUT THE MURMUR OF VOICES CAME TO HIS EAR BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE
HE RECOGNIZED THE FACE AND SAW TO HIS SURPRISE THAT IT WAS A KNIGHT
WAS TAKEN ROLAND WAS KILLED AND I WAS CAST OUT WITH MY CHILD AFTERWARDS THEY REPENTED THAT THEY HAD LET ME GO AND SEARCHED FAR AND WIDE FOR ME BUT I WAS HIDDEN IN THE COTTAGE OF A WOODCUTTER
INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO WILL BE KIND TO HIM AND THIS WILL I TRUST BE TOMORROW SAY NOUGHT ABOUT IT GEOFFREY ANSWERED MADGE AND I ARE RIGHT GLAD TO HAVE BEEN OF SERVICE TO YOU
THE TOWER WAS BUT HALF A MILE DISTANT BUT BEFORE MASTER ROGER ARRIVED WALTER HAD ALREADY RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS
ARE THIS EVENING GOING TO MAKE AN ATTACK UPON A BOAT WITH A LADY IN IT COMING DOWN THE RIVER WE WILL BE ON THE SPOT
BUT WAS NOW A NARROW STRUCTURE OVER THE GATEWAY ACROSS THE RIVER UPON PIKES WERE A NUMBER OF HEADS AND HUMAN LIMBS THE LADY SHUDDERED AS SHE LOOKED UP
MORE THAN ONCE SURLY MEN HAD ACCOSTED HIM AND HAD THREATENED TO KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD IF THEY AGAIN FOUND HIM WANDERING THAT WAY BUT WALTER LAUGHED AT THEIR THREATS
HE WAS UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DISAPPEARANCE THEN HE SAW THAT THE SPOT ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY A MERE CLUMP OF BUSHES NO HIGHER THAN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS REALLY AN ELEVATED HUMMOCK OF GROUND
LOOKED ROUND AS HIS VISITOR ENTERED THE SHOP AND THEN WITH A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION LOWERED THE BOW HUSH GILES THE LADY EXCLAIMED IT IS I BUT NAME NO NAMES IT WERE BEST THAT NONE KNEW ME HERE
THOUGH INDEED I LIKE WELL TO USE THEM AND WILL PARKER WHO IS TEACHING ME SAYS THAT I SHOW RARE PROMISE BUT IT WOULD NEVER BE TO MY TASTE TO STAND ALL DAY SAWING AND SMOOTHING AND POLISHING ONE BOW IS TO ME MUCH LIKE ANOTHER THOUGH MY FATHER HOLDS THAT THERE ARE RARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM
IT IS ASSUREDLY NO BUSINESS OF MINE BUT IT MAY LEAD TO AN ADVENTURE AND I HAVE HAD NO REAL FUN SINCE I LEFT ALDGATE I WILL FOLLOW
THAT MATTER DID NOT TROUBLE ME I KNEW BETTER THAN TO BRING MONEY INTO THIS SWAMP OF YOURS WHEN I MIGHT BE ATTACKED BY HALF A DOZEN RUFFIANS LIKE YOURSELF
THE MARSHES SEARCHED FROM END TO END AND ALL FOUND THERE SHOULD BE KNOCKED ON HEAD AND THROWN INTO THEIR OWN DITCHES THERE WOULD BE NO FEAR OF ANY HONEST MAN COMING TO HIS END THEREBY BUT NOW TO BED LAD
ON SUNDAYS WALTER ALWAYS SPENT THE DAY WITH GILES FLETCHER AND HIS WIFE GOING TO MASS WITH THEM AND WALKING IN THE FIELDS WHERE
THE ROOF WAS FORMED OF AN OLD BOAT TURNED BOTTOM UPWARDS AND THIS HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BROWN TURF IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PLACE OF CONCEALMENT
I HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH MY WIFE AND SO FAR SHE AND I ARE NOT OF ONE MIND I THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO KEEP HIM IN IGNORANCE OF HIS BIRTH AND LINEAGE SINCE THE KNOWLEDGE CANNOT BENEFIT HIM AND WILL BUT RENDER HIM DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT
AND THAT BERTHA WOULD SERVE HER AS GLADLY AND FAITHFULLY AS EVER SHE DID WHEN SHE WAS HER NURSE YET SHE COULD NOT BUT GREATLY FEEL THE CHANGE SHE WAS TENDERLY BROUGHT UP BEING AS I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF SIR HAROLD BROOME
WITH DAME FLETCHER THEN UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF GEOFFREY WHO INSISTED ON CARRYING THE BOY SHE SET OUT FROM THE SMITH'S COTTAGE THEY PASSED UNDER THE OUTER GATE AND ACROSS THE BRIDGE WHICH LATER ON WAS COVERED WITH A DOUBLE LINE OF HOUSES AND SHOPS
THEY ROWED BY TURNS ALL WERE FAIRLY EXPERT AT THE EXERCISE FOR IN THOSE DAYS THE THAMES WAS AT ONCE THE GREAT HIGHWAY AND PLAYGROUND OF LONDON
I HAD HEARD BUT VAGUELY OF YOUR TROUBLES GILES FLETCHER SAID BUT HOPED THAT THE RUMOURS WERE FALSE EVER SINCE THE DUKE OF KENT WAS EXECUTED THE AIR HAS BEEN FULL OF RUMOURS THEN CAME NEWS OF THE KILLING OF MORTIMER AND OF THE IMPRISONMENT OF THE KING'S MOTHER
THEY SPOKE LITTLE MORE BUT THEIR HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ON THE SWAMPY GROUND WERE A SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE FOR HIM AT LAST
THE KNOWLEDGE OF ARMS MAY WELL BE OF USE TO HIM AND I PROMISE YOU THAT SUCH SKILL AS I HAVE I WILL TEACH HIM WHEN HE GROWS OLD ENOUGH TO WIELD SWORD AND BATTLE AXE AS YOU KNOW I MAY WITHOUT BOASTING SAY
AND BARING THEIR HEADS STOOD STILL IN CONFUSION NO HARM IS DONE THE PRINCE SAID
THAT GEOFFREY WARD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE NEEDED TO PUT OUT ALL HIS SKILL TO HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIS PUPIL BUT IT WAS NOT ALONE WITH GEOFFREY THAT WALTER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING THE USE OF ARMS WHENEVER A SOLDIER RETURNED FROM THE WARS
THE WOMAN DRANK THE STEAMING BEVERAGE WHICH HER HOST BROUGHT WITH HIM
UNTIL SHE RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN GEOFFREY WARD RETURNED THE WOMAN WAS SITTING IN A SETTLE BY THE FIRESIDE DRESSED IN A WARM WOOLEN GARMENT BELONGING TO HIS SISTER MADGE HAD THROWN FRESH WOOD ON THE FIRE WHICH WAS BLAZING BRIGHTLY NOW
HAD DRIVEN THE OTHER OFF FROM A HEAP OF RUBBISH WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED WITHOUT THE WALLS EACH PARTY HAD A FLAG ATTACHED TO A STICK AND THE BOYS WERE ARMED WITH CLUBS SUCH AS THOSE CARRIED BY THE APPRENTICE BOYS MANY OF THEM CARRIED MIMIC SHIELDS MADE OF WOOD
AND THE FIRE MUST BE ALIGHT AT DAYBREAK ON HIS WAY BACK
WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT AUGHT LAY CONCEALED WITHIN THEM A CLEVER HIDING PLACE WALTER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF NO WONDER THE POSSE SEARCH THESE SWAMPS IN VAIN THIS IS THE LOWEST AND WETTEST PART OF THE SWAMP AND WOULD BE BUT LIGHTLY SEARCHED
AS ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS WOULD CONCEAL HIS FIGURE HE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT TREAD IN A POOL OR DITCH AND SO BETRAY HIS PRESENCE PUTTING HIS FOOT EACH TIME TO THE GROUND WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION HE MOVED QUIETLY AFTER THEM
WHAT A JOY IT WILL BE TO HER TO SEE YOU AGAIN SO SAYING GILES LED THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT ABOVE THERE WAS A SCREAM OF SURPRISE AND JOY FROM HIS WIFE AND THEN GILES QUIETLY WITHDREW DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN
WHY DO YOU NOT PLAY MORE QUIETLY THE FEUDS BETWEEN THE BOYS OF DIFFERENT WARDS ARE BECOMING A SERIOUS NUISANCE AND MANY INJURIES HAVE BEEN INFLICTED
HE SAID SUDDENLY AS A SOB FROM THE FIGURE BY HIS SIDE
AS TO ARCHERY HE NEED NOT GO FAR TO LEARN IT SINCE YOUR APPRENTICE WILL PARKER LAST YEAR WON THE PRIZE AS THE BEST MARKSMAN IN THE CITY BOUNDS TRUST ME
HE AND HIS MASTER HAD A LONG BOUT TOGETHER WITH CUDGEL OR QUARTERSTAFF SWORD OR AXE
THEY WILL DOUBTLESS BE CONFERRED UPON THOSE WHO HAVE AIDED THE YOUNG KING IN FREEING HIMSELF FROM HIS MOTHER'S DOMINATION FOR WHICH INDEED ALTHOUGH I LAMENT THAT LADY ALICE SHOULD HAVE SUFFERED SO SORELY IN THE DOING OF IT I BLAME HIM NOT AT ALL
GEOFFREY WARD ENTERED THE SHOP OF GILES FLETCHER I HAVE BROUGHT YOU TWENTY SCORE OF ARROWHEADS MASTER GILES HE SAID THEY HAVE BEEN LONGER IN HAND THAN IS USUAL WITH ME BUT I HAVE BEEN PRESSED AND HOW GOES IT WITH THE LADY WHOM I BROUGHT TO YOUR DOOR LAST WEEK
YOU HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE MASTER ROGER THE PRINCE SAID
WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE KING'S GRANDFATHER SOME TWENTY YEARS BACK BUT AFTER ALL THEY FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY
SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT FOR WITH ALL HER TENDERNESS AND WOMANLY SWEETNESS SHE WAS STILL A MARTIAN AND TO A MARTIAN THE ONLY GOOD ENEMY IS A DEAD ENEMY FOR EVERY DEAD FOEMAN MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WHO LIVE
AS I TOUCHED THE CORD THE SKELETONS SWUNG TO THE MOTION WITH A NOISE AS OF THE RUSTLING OF DRY LEAVES IT WAS A MOST GROTESQUE AND HORRID TABLEAU AND I HASTENED OUT INTO THE FRESH AIR GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM SO GRUESOME A PLACE
THEIR BULLETS EXPLODE WHEN THEY STRIKE AN OBJECT WELL THE OPAQUE OUTER COATING IS BROKEN BY THE IMPACT EXPOSING A GLASS CYLINDER ALMOST SOLID IN THE FORWARD END OF WHICH IS A MINUTE PARTICLE OF RADIUM POWDER
MY FATHER AND I OWNING AND OPERATING A STRING OF GENERAL STORES THROUGHOUT VIRGINIA AT THAT TIME CAPTAIN CARTER HAD A SMALL BUT BEAUTIFUL COTTAGE SITUATED ON A BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE RIVER AND DURING ONE OF MY LAST VISITS IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE
OR THE SPEED AT WHICH I WAS TRAVELING MY CHANCES FOR FINDING IT WERE SLIM HELIUM LIES A THOUSAND MILES SOUTHWEST OF ZODANGA AND WITH MY COMPASS INTACT I SHOULD HAVE MADE THE TRIP
FOR EVEN THOUGH WE DIE AT THEIR HANDS WE CAN AFFORD THEM PITY SINCE WE ARE GREATER THAN THEY AND THEY KNOW IT
IN SUBMITTING CAPTAIN CARTER'S STRANGE MANUSCRIPT TO YOU IN BOOK FORM I BELIEVE THAT A FEW WORDS RELATIVE TO THIS REMARKABLE PERSONALITY WILL BE OF INTEREST MY FIRST RECOLLECTION OF CAPTAIN CARTER IS OF THE FEW MONTHS
FILLED HIM WITH DISMAY IT CANNOT BE HE EXCLAIMED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WHY NO MAN IN ALL HELIUM BUT WOULD PREFER DEATH TO THE SELLING OF OUR LOVED PRINCESS TO THE RULING HOUSE OF ZODANGA
I SOON REACHED AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE BUILDING WHERE I HOPED TO FIND THE HELIUMITE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT I STOOD IN THE ROOM BEFORE HIM HE WAS ALONE AND SHOWED NO SURPRISE AT MY COMING SAYING HE HAD EXPECTED ME MUCH EARLIER
WITH THE CARRIAGE OF THE TRAINED FIGHTING MAN HIS FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND CLEAR CUT HIS HAIR BLACK AND CLOSELY CROPPED WHILE HIS EYES WERE OF A STEEL GRAY REFLECTING A STRONG AND LOYAL CHARACTER FILLED WITH FIRE
AS I NEARED THE BUILDING I BECAME MORE CAREFUL AS I JUDGED AND RIGHTLY THAT THE PLACE WOULD BE GUARDED SEVERAL MEN IN CIVILIAN METAL LOITERED NEAR THE FRONT ENTRANCE AND IN THE REAR WERE OTHERS MY ONLY MEANS OF REACHING
OR DID HER BEAUTIFUL BODY LIE COLD IN DEATH BESIDE THE TINY GOLDEN INCUBATOR IN THE SUNKEN GARDEN
THE WATCHMAN RELATED THE FEW DETAILS CONNECTED WITH THE FINDING OF THE BODY
NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROUD CLAIM OF THE THARKS TO ABSOLUTE VERITY DEJAH THORIS LAUGHED I KNEW THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU BECAME A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY YOU WOULD NOT CEASE TO BE MY FRIEND A WARRIOR MAY CHANGE HIS METAL BUT NOT HIS HEART AS THE SAYING IS UPON BARSOOM
ASKED TARS TARKAS ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD SEEN ME RUN MY ARM FAR BETWEEN THE GREAT JAWS OF ONE OF MY THOATS WHICH HAD WEDGED A PIECE OF STONE BETWEEN TWO OF HIS TEETH WHILE FEEDING UPON THE MOSS LIKE VEGETATION WITHIN OUR COURT YARD
I COULD TAKE A HUMAN LIFE IF NECESSARY WITH FAR LESS COMPUNCTION THAN THAT OF A POOR
THAT SHOULD YOU ACCIDENTALLY WOUND AN ENEMY YOU WOULD TAKE HIM HOME AND NURSE HIM BACK TO HEALTH SHE LAUGHED THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT WE DO ON EARTH I ANSWERED AT LEAST AMONG CIVILIZED MEN THIS MADE HER LAUGH AGAIN
AND BY MEANS OF WHICH LANDING PARTIES ARE LOWERED TO THE GROUND FROM THE BATTLESHIPS I SWUNG THIS HOOK CAUTIOUSLY
EVIDENTLY IN SEARCH OF ME NOT UNTIL THEIR LIGHTS WERE NO LONGER DISCERNIBLE DID I VENTURE TO FLASH MY LITTLE LAMP UPON MY COMPASS
GRATING SOUND WHICH TURNED ME COLD WITH APPREHENSION THEN THE HOOK CAUGHT AND I WAS SAFE CLAMBERING QUICKLY ALOFT I GRASPED THE EDGE OF THE EAVES AND DREW MYSELF TO THE SURFACE OF THE ROOF ABOVE
THE CONCUSSION NEARLY CAPSIZED HER AND WITH A SICKENING PLUNGE SHE HURTLED DOWNWARD THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT
AS I GAINED MY FEET I WAS CONFRONTED BY THE SENTRY ON DUTY INTO THE MUZZLE OF WHOSE REVOLVER I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING WHO ARE YOU AND WHENCE CAME YOU HE CRIED
I ASKED THERE IS USUALLY BUT ONE MAN ON DUTY THERE AT NIGHT UPON THE ROOF GO TO THE ROOF OF THIS BUILDING KANTOS KAN AND WAIT ME THERE
AND HAD THE CHOICE BEEN LEFT TO ME I COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A MORE FITTING MATE FOR THE FIRST PRINCESS OF BARSOOM HERE IS MY HAND UPON YOUR SHOULDER JOHN CARTER AND MY WORD
AND THEN HUNG HIM OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF AS I MYSELF HAD HUNG A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE I KNEW IT WOULD BE MORNING BEFORE HE WOULD BE DISCOVERED AND I NEEDED ALL THE TIME THAT I COULD GAIN DONNING MY TRAPPINGS AND WEAPONS
LONGER THAN THE ACT OF ADJUSTING THE SILK REQUIRED SHE DID NOT DRAW AWAY NOR DID SHE SPEAK AND SO IN SILENCE WE WALKED THE SURFACE OF A DYING WORLD BUT IN THE BREAST OF ONE OF US AT LEAST HAD BEEN BORN THAT
A STRANGE FEATURE ABOUT THE TOMB WHERE HIS BODY STILL LIES IS THAT THE MASSIVE DOOR IS EQUIPPED WITH A SINGLE HUGE GOLD PLATED SPRING LOCK WHICH CAN BE OPENED ONLY FROM THE INSIDE
THEY WOULD FOLLOW ME LIKE DOGS RUBBING THEIR GREAT SNOUTS AGAINST MY BODY IN AWKWARD EVIDENCE OF AFFECTION AND RESPOND TO MY EVERY COMMAND WITH AN ALACRITY AND DOCILITY WHICH CAUSED THE MARTIAN WARRIORS TO ASCRIBE TO ME THE POSSESSION OF SOME EARTHLY POWER UNKNOWN ON MARS
LED DIRECTLY TO HIS APARTMENTS AND WAS KNOWN ONLY TO HIM IF I CAN REACH THE ROOF OF THE BARRACKS AND GET MY MACHINE I CAN BE IN SAB THAN'S QUARTERS IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HOW AM I TO ESCAPE FROM THIS BUILDING GUARDED AS YOU SAY IT IS
I FELL UPON IT BY CHANCE ONE DAY AS I WAS PASSING ABOVE THE PALACE ON PATROL DUTY IN THIS WORK IT IS REQUIRED THAT WE INVESTIGATE ANY UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE WE MAY WITNESS AND A FACE PEERING FROM THE PINNACLE OF THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE WAS TO ME MOST
SUCH AS CONTACT WITH NO OTHER MORTAL HAD EVEN PRODUCED AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE HAD LEANED SLIGHTLY TOWARD ME BUT OF THAT I WAS NOT SURE ONLY I KNEW THAT AS MY ARM RESTED THERE ACROSS HER SHOULDERS
ALTHOUGH I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE TERM A RELIGIOUS MAN SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER I HAD RETURNED HOME FROM MY LAST VISIT
THEY WERE DEALT A TERRIFIC BLOW BETWEEN THE EARS WITH THE BUTT OF A PISTOL AND IF THEY SHOWED FIGHT THIS TREATMENT WAS CONTINUED UNTIL THE BRUTES EITHER WERE SUBDUED OR HAD UNSEATED THEIR RIDERS
BY KINDNESS I REPLIED YOU SEE TARS TARKAS THE SOFTER SENTIMENTS HAVE THEIR VALUE EVEN TO A WARRIOR IN THE HEIGHT OF BATTLE AS WELL AS UPON THE MARCH I KNOW THAT MY THOATS WILL OBEY MY EVERY COMMAND
I HAVE SEEN HIM FROM MY WINDOW STANDING IN THE MOONLIGHT ON THE BRINK OF THE BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE HUDSON WITH HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT TO THE HEAVENS AS THOUGH IN APPEAL I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS PRAYING
HIS FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS RELATED TO THIS MANUSCRIPT WHICH I WAS TO RETAIN SEALED AND UNREAD JUST AS I FOUND IT FOR ELEVEN YEARS NOR WAS I TO DIVULGE ITS CONTENTS UNTIL TWENTY ONE YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH
THE SILVERED MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE THE ALMOST STATIONARY MOON HANGING IN THE SKY THE CACTI STUDDED VALLEY BELOW ME WERE NOT OF MARS
HE SPENT AT MY FATHER'S HOME IN VIRGINIA JUST PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE CIVIL WAR I WAS THEN A CHILD OF BUT FIVE YEARS
WHERE I HAD SEEN HIM ON THOSE OTHER NIGHTS WITH HIS ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION TO THE SKIES THERE WERE NO MARKS OF VIOLENCE ON THE BODY AND WITH THE AID OF A LOCAL PHYSICIAN THE CORONER'S JURY QUICKLY REACHED A DECISION OF DEATH FROM HEART FAILURE
THE JEDDAK OF HELIUM FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE WAITED AND PRAYED FOR AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTIONS FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE WAITED AND PRAYED TO BE TAKEN BACK TO THE WORLD OF MY LOST LOVE I WOULD RATHER LIE DEAD BESIDE HER THERE
QUICK EXPLAIN YOURSELF OR I CALL THE GUARD LOOK YOU HERE SENTRY AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW I CAME
LEFT ALONE IN THE STUDY I OPENED THE SAFE AND WITHDREW THE CONTENTS OF THE DRAWER IN WHICH HE HAD TOLD ME I WOULD FIND MY INSTRUCTIONS THEY WERE IN PART PECULIAR INDEED
AND TONIGHT SHE SEEMS CALLING TO ME AGAIN AS SHE HAS NOT CALLED BEFORE SINCE THAT LONG DEAD NIGHT AND I THINK I CAN SEE ACROSS THAT AWFUL ABYSS OF SPACE A BEAUTIFUL BLACK HAIRED WOMAN STANDING IN THE GARDEN OF A PALACE AND AT HER SIDE IS A LITTLE BOY WHO PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HER
I FELT MYSELF OVER FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND FROM HEAD TO FOOT I WAS CLOTHED
WHICH IS EVER OLDEST YET EVER NEW I LOVED DEJAH THORIS THE TOUCH OF MY ARM UPON HER NAKED SHOULDER HAD SPOKEN TO ME IN WORDS I WOULD NOT MISTAKE
DID THE VITALIZING AIR REACH THE PEOPLE OF THAT DISTANT PLANET IN TIME TO SAVE THEM
IF SUCCESSFUL HE WAS THEN TO FOLLOW ME HE SET MY COMPASS FOR ME A CLEVER LITTLE DEVICE WHICH WILL REMAIN STEADFASTLY FIXED UPON ANY GIVEN POINT ON THE SURFACE OF BARSOOM AND BIDDING EACH OTHER FAREWELL WE ROSE TOGETHER
I ADVANCED TO MEET THEM AND TELLING SOLA THAT I WOULD TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEJAH THORIS SAFEKEEPING I DIRECTED HER TO RETURN TO HER QUARTERS ON SOME TRIVIAL ERRAND I LIKED AND TRUSTED SOLA BUT FOR SOME REASON I DESIRED TO BE ALONE WITH DEJAH THORIS
WHICH BROUGHT ROGUISH DIMPLES TO THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND CRIED WHAT A CHILD A GREAT WARRIOR AND YET A STUMBLING LITTLE CHILD WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW I ASKED IN SORE PERPLEXITY
ONE OF THESE MATCHES I STRUCK AND ITS DIM FLAME LIGHTED UP WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HUGE CAVE TOWARD THE BACK OF WHICH I DISCOVERED A STRANGE STILL FIGURE HUDDLED OVER A TINY BENCH AS I APPROACHED IT
BUT I HOPE NEVERTHELESS THAT I MAY BE PRESENT THE NEXT TIME THAT ANY MARTIAN GREEN RED PINK OR VIOLET HAS THE TEMERITY TO EVEN SO MUCH AS FROWN ON YOU MY PRINCESS
SO THAT AS MY BODY SWUNG OUT AT THE END OF THE STRAP IT WOULD SLIP OFF AND LAUNCH ME TO THE PAVEMENT A THOUSAND FEET BELOW AN INSTANT I HESITATED AND THEN RELEASING MY GRASP UPON THE SUPPORTING ORNAMENT I SWUNG OUT INTO SPACE AT THE END OF THE STRAP
AT HEART THEY HATE THEIR HORRID FATES AND SO WREAK THEIR POOR SPITE ON ME WHO STAND FOR EVERYTHING THEY HAVE NOT AND FOR ALL THEY MOST CRAVE AND NEVER CAN ATTAIN LET US PITY THEM MY CHIEFTAIN
I LOST NO TIME IN EXPLANATION BUT PLUNGED IMMEDIATELY INTO A DISCUSSION OF OUR PLANS FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
THEY HAVE HAD ME DOWN IN THE PITS BELOW THE BUILDINGS HELPING THEM MIX THEIR AWFUL RADIUM POWDER AND MAKE THEIR TERRIBLE PROJECTILES YOU KNOW THAT THESE HAVE TO BE MANUFACTURED BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT
TELLING ME I WOULD FIND HIS WILL THERE AND SOME PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS WHICH HE HAD ME PLEDGE MYSELF TO CARRY OUT WITH ABSOLUTE FIDELITY AFTER I HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT
AT THE ARIZONA CAVE IT WAS DARK WHEN I OPENED MY EYES AGAIN STRANGE STIFF GARMENTS WERE UPON MY BODY
BUT THE TRUTH SLOWLY FORCED ITSELF UPON ME I WAS LOOKING UPON ARIZONA FROM THE SAME LEDGE FROM WHICH TEN YEARS BEFORE I HAD GAZED WITH LONGING UPON MARS BURYING MY HEAD IN MY ARMS I TURNED
FOR DEJAH THORIS AND FOR YOU THIS VERY NIGHT I SHALL TRY TO REACH HIS QUARTERS IN THE PALACE HOW I ASKED YOU ARE STRONGLY GUARDED AND A QUADRUPLE FORCE PATROLS THE SKY HE BENT HIS HEAD IN THOUGHT
DARK SMOOTH FACED ATHLETIC MAN WHOM I CALLED UNCLE JACK HE SEEMED ALWAYS TO BE LAUGHING
GENTLY I PULLED ON IT TO STRENGTHEN ITS HOLD BUT WHETHER IT WOULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF MY BODY I DID NOT KNOW IT MIGHT BE BARELY CAUGHT UPON THE VERY OUTER VERGE OF THE ROOF
FAR BELOW ME LAY THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED STREETS THE HARD PAVEMENTS AND DEATH THERE WAS A LITTLE JERK AT THE TOP OF THE SUPPORTING EAVES
WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE A LONG PIECE HAVEN'T WE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS EIGHT MILES I'M GLAD BECAUSE I LOVE DRIVING OH IT SEEMS SO WONDERFUL THAT I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU AND BELONG TO YOU I'VE NEVER BELONGED TO ANYBODY NOT REALLY BUT THE ASYLUM WAS THE WORST I'VE ONLY BEEN IN IT FOUR MONTHS BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
WHO HAD BEEN STOLEN AWAY FROM HER PARENTS IN HER INFANCY BY A CRUEL NURSE WHO DIED BEFORE SHE COULD CONFESS I USED TO LIE AWAKE AT NIGHTS AND IMAGINE THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE TIME IN THE DAY I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M SO THIN I AM DREADFUL THIN AIN'T I THERE ISN'T A PICK ON MY BONES
MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS UP HERE ONE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO GET A LITTLE GIRL FROM THE ASYLUM OVER IN HOPETON IN THE SPRING
AND I USED TO IMAGINE I WAS LIVING HERE BUT I NEVER REALLY EXPECTED I WOULD IT'S DELIGHTFUL WHEN YOUR IMAGINATIONS COME TRUE ISN'T IT BUT THOSE RED ROADS ARE SO FUNNY WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TRAIN AT CHARLOTTETOWN AND THE RED ROADS BEGAN TO FLASH PAST I ASKED MISSUS SPENCER WHAT MADE THEM RED
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL WHAT DID THAT TREE LEANING OUT FROM THE BANK ALL WHITE AND LACY MAKE YOU THINK OF SHE ASKED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHY A BRIDE OF COURSE A BRIDE ALL IN WHITE WITH A LOVELY MISTY VEIL
THERE'S NEVER ANYBODY TO BE HAD BUT THOSE STUPID HALF GROWN LITTLE FRENCH BOYS AND AS SOON AS YOU DO GET ONE BROKE INTO YOUR WAYS AND TAUGHT SOMETHING HE'S UP AND OFF TO THE LOBSTER CANNERIES OR THE STATES AT FIRST MATTHEW SUGGESTED GETTING A HOME BOY BUT I SAID NO FLAT TO THAT
AND HIS BEST SUIT OF CLOTHES WHICH WAS PLAIN PROOF THAT HE WAS GOING OUT OF AVONLEA AND HE HAD THE BUGGY AND THE SORREL MARE WHICH BETOKENED THAT HE WAS GOING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE NOW WHERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT GOING AND WHY WAS HE GOING THERE
CHAPTER ONE MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE IS SURPRISED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE LIVED JUST WHERE THE AVONLEA MAIN ROAD DIPPED DOWN INTO A LITTLE HOLLOW FRINGED WITH ALDERS AND LADIES EARDROPS AND TRAVERSED BY A BROOK
ANYBODY WHO WENT OUT OF IT OR INTO IT HAD TO PASS OVER THAT HILL ROAD AND SO RUN THE UNSEEN GAUNTLET OF MISSUS RACHEL'S ALL SEEING EYE SHE WAS SITTING THERE ONE AFTERNOON IN EARLY JUNE THE SUN WAS COMING IN AT THE WINDOW WARM AND BRIGHT
SHE SAID SHE HADN'T TIME TO GET SICK WATCHING TO SEE THAT I DIDN'T FALL OVERBOARD SHE SAID SHE NEVER SAW THE BEAT OF ME FOR PROWLING ABOUT BUT IF IT KEPT HER FROM BEING SEASICK IT'S A MERCY I DID PROWL ISN'T IT AND I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO BE SEEN ON THAT BOAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I'D EVER HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN HAS BEEN IN AND GONE HALF AN HOUR AGO ANSWERED THAT BRISK OFFICIAL BUT THERE WAS A PASSENGER DROPPED OFF FOR YOU A LITTLE GIRL SHE'S SITTING OUT THERE ON THE SHINGLES I ASKED HER TO GO INTO THE LADIES WAITING ROOM BUT SHE INFORMED ME GRAVELY THAT SHE PREFERRED TO STAY OUTSIDE
ONE COULD HAVE EATEN A MEAL OFF THE GROUND WITHOUT OVERBRIMMING THE PROVERBIAL PECK OF DIRT MISSUS RACHEL RAPPED SMARTLY AT THE KITCHEN DOOR AND STEPPED IN WHEN BIDDEN TO DO SO THE KITCHEN AT GREEN GABLES WAS A CHEERFUL APARTMENT
WAS SO LUDICROUSLY AFRAID MATTHEW HOWEVER WAS SPARED THE ORDEAL OF SPEAKING FIRST FOR AS SOON AS SHE CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS COMING TO HER SHE STOOD UP GRASPING WITH ONE THIN BROWN HAND THE HANDLE OF A SHABBY OLD FASHIONED CARPET BAG THE OTHER SHE HELD OUT TO HIM
BUT MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WAS ONE OF THOSE CAPABLE CREATURES WHO CAN MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS AND THOSE OF OTHER FOLKS INTO THE BARGAIN SHE WAS A NOTABLE HOUSEWIFE HER WORK WAS ALWAYS DONE AND WELL DONE SHE RAN THE SEWING CIRCLE
IT'S SO SELDOM MATTHEW SETS HIS MIND ON ANYTHING THAT WHEN HE DOES I ALWAYS FEEL IT'S MY DUTY TO GIVE IN AND AS FOR THE RISK THERE'S RISKS IN PRETTY NEAR EVERYTHING A BODY DOES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S RISKS IN PEOPLE'S HAVING CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN IF IT COMES TO THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS TURN OUT WELL
BUT THERE WAS A SAVING SOMETHING ABOUT HER MOUTH WHICH IF IT HAD BEEN EVER SO SLIGHTLY DEVELOPED MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF A SENSE OF HUMOR WE'RE ALL PRETTY WELL SAID MISSUS RACHEL I WAS KIND OF AFRAID YOU WEREN'T THOUGH WHEN I SAW MATTHEW STARTING OFF TODAY I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WAS GOING TO THE DOCTOR'S
PETER HAD ASKED HIM OF COURSE FOR MATTHEW CUTHBERT HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO VOLUNTEER INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIS WHOLE LIFE AND YET HERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT AT HALF PAST THREE ON THE AFTERNOON OF A BUSY DAY PLACIDLY DRIVING OVER THE HOLLOW AND UP THE HILL
SO IN THE END WE DECIDED TO ASK MISSUS SPENCER TO PICK US OUT ONE WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO GET HER LITTLE GIRL WE HEARD LAST WEEK SHE WAS GOING SO WE SENT HER WORD BY RICHARD SPENCER'S FOLKS AT CARMODY TO BRING US A SMART LIKELY BOY OF ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN WE DECIDED THAT WOULD BE THE BEST AGE
HE THOUGHT HE WAS TOO EARLY SO HE TIED HIS HORSE IN THE YARD OF THE SMALL BRIGHT RIVER HOTEL AND WENT OVER TO THE STATION HOUSE THE LONG PLATFORM WAS ALMOST DESERTED THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE IN SIGHT BEING A GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A PILE OF SHINGLES AT THE EXTREME END
THEY MAY BE ALL RIGHT I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT BUT NO LONDON STREET ARABS FOR ME I SAID GIVE ME A NATIVE BORN AT LEAST THERE'LL BE A RISK NO MATTER WHO WE GET BUT I'LL FEEL EASIER IN MY MIND AND SLEEP SOUNDER AT NIGHTS IF WE GET A BORN CANADIAN
IT'S WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS WICKED OF ME TO TALK LIKE THAT
HAD GOT AS FAR AWAY AS HE POSSIBLY COULD FROM HIS FELLOW MEN WITHOUT ACTUALLY RETREATING INTO THE WOODS WHEN HE FOUNDED HIS HOMESTEAD GREEN GABLES WAS BUILT AT THE FURTHEST EDGE OF HIS CLEARED LAND AND THERE IT WAS TO THIS DAY
AND HER AFTERNOON'S ENJOYMENT WAS SPOILED I'LL JUST STEP OVER TO GREEN GABLES AFTER TEA AND FIND OUT FROM MARILLA WHERE HE'S GONE AND WHY THE WORTHY WOMAN FINALLY CONCLUDED HE DOESN'T GENERALLY GO TO TOWN THIS TIME OF YEAR AND HE NEVER VISITS
GUESS THERE'S SOME MISTAKE HE SAID MISSUS SPENCER CAME OFF THE TRAIN WITH THAT GIRL AND GAVE HER INTO MY CHARGE SAID YOU AND YOUR SISTER WERE ADOPTING HER FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND THAT YOU WOULD BE ALONG FOR HER PRESENTLY THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT AND I HAVEN'T GOT ANY MORE ORPHANS CONCEALED HEREABOUTS
OR WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEERFUL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SO PAINFULLY CLEAN AS TO GIVE IT SOMETHING OF THE APPEARANCE OF AN UNUSED PARLOR ITS WINDOWS LOOKED EAST AND WEST THROUGH THE WEST ONE LOOKING OUT ON THE BACK YARD CAME A FLOOD OF MELLOW JUNE SUNLIGHT BUT THE EAST ONE
SET ABOUT ON ONE SIDE WITH GREAT PATRIARCHAL WILLOWS AND THE OTHER WITH PRIM LOMBARDIES NOT A STRAY STICK NOR STONE WAS TO BE SEEN FOR MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE SEEN IT IF THERE HAD BEEN PRIVATELY SHE WAS OF THE OPINION THAT MARILLA CUTHBERT SWEPT THAT YARD OVER AS OFTEN AS SHE SWEPT HER HOUSE
MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE LIKED TO STAY UNTIL MATTHEW CAME HOME WITH HIS IMPORTED ORPHAN BUT REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD TWO HOURS AT LEAST BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL SHE CONCLUDED TO GO UP THE ROAD TO ROBERT BELL'S AND TELL THE NEWS IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE A SENSATION SECOND TO NONE
BUT I DO HOPE THAT SOME DAY I SHALL HAVE A WHITE DRESS THAT IS MY HIGHEST IDEAL OF EARTHLY BLISS I JUST LOVE PRETTY CLOTHES AND I'VE NEVER HAD A PRETTY DRESS IN MY LIFE THAT I CAN REMEMBER BUT OF COURSE IT'S ALL THE MORE TO LOOK FORWARD TO ISN'T IT AND THEN
HE DETESTED THE WAY THEY HAD OF SIDLING PAST HIM TIMIDLY WITH SIDEWISE GLANCES AS IF THEY EXPECTED HIM TO GOBBLE THEM UP AT A MOUTHFUL IF THEY VENTURED TO SAY A WORD THAT WAS THE AVONLEA TYPE OF WELL BRED LITTLE GIRL BUT THIS FRECKLED WITCH WAS VERY DIFFERENT
THIN WOMAN WITH ANGLES AND WITHOUT CURVES HER DARK HAIR SHOWED SOME GRAY STREAKS AND WAS ALWAYS TWISTED UP IN A HARD LITTLE KNOT BEHIND WITH TWO WIRE HAIRPINS STUCK AGGRESSIVELY THROUGH IT SHE LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN OF NARROW EXPERIENCE AND RIGID CONSCIENCE WHICH SHE WAS
BUT I'D RATHER BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART WOULDN'T YOU WHEN WE GOT ON THE TRAIN I FELT AS IF EVERYBODY MUST BE LOOKING AT ME AND PITYING ME BUT I JUST WENT TO WORK AND IMAGINED THAT I HAD ON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PALE BLUE SILK DRESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE IMAGINING YOU MIGHT AS WELL IMAGINE SOMETHING WORTH WHILE
WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF LIKE MOST QUIET FOLKS HE LIKED TALKATIVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE WILLING TO DO THE TALKING THEMSELVES AND DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO KEEP UP HIS END OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO ENJOY THE SOCIETY OF A LITTLE GIRL WOMEN WERE BAD ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE BUT LITTLE GIRLS WERE WORSE
AND I KNOW ANOTHER CASE WHERE AN ADOPTED BOY USED TO SUCK THE EGGS THEY COULDN'T BREAK HIM OF IT IF YOU HAD ASKED MY ADVICE IN THE MATTER WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO MARILLA I'D HAVE SAID FOR MERCY'S SAKE NOT TO THINK OF SUCH A THING THAT'S WHAT
THEY SEEM CONTENTED ENOUGH BUT THEN I SUPPOSE THEY'RE USED TO IT A BODY CAN GET USED TO ANYTHING EVEN TO BEING HANGED AS THE IRISHMAN SAID WITH THIS MISSUS RACHEL STEPPED OUT OF THE LANE INTO THE BACKYARD OF GREEN GABLES VERY GREEN AND NEAT AND PRECISE WAS THAT YARD
MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THE CHIN WAS VERY POINTED AND PRONOUNCED THAT THE BIG EYES WERE FULL OF SPIRIT AND VIVACITY THAT THE MOUTH WAS SWEET LIPPED AND EXPRESSIVE THAT THE FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND FULL IN SHORT OUR DISCERNING EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE CONCLUDED
MATTHEW ENJOYED THE DRIVE AFTER HIS OWN FASHION EXCEPT DURING THE MOMENTS WHEN HE MET WOMEN AND HAD TO NOD TO THEM FOR IN PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO NOD TO ALL AND SUNDRY YOU MEET ON THE ROAD WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM OR NOT MATTHEW DREADED ALL WOMEN EXCEPT MARILLA AND MISSUS RACHEL
AND THAT IF SHE NOTICED ANYTHING ODD OR OUT OF PLACE SHE WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL SHE HAD FERRETED OUT THE WHYS AND WHEREFORES THEREOF THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN AVONLEA AND OUT OF IT WHO CAN ATTEND CLOSELY TO THEIR NEIGHBOR'S BUSINESS BY DINT OF NEGLECTING THEIR OWN
YET WHAT OF MATTHEW'S WHITE COLLAR AND THE SORREL MARE MISSUS RACHEL WAS GETTING FAIRLY DIZZY WITH THIS UNUSUAL MYSTERY ABOUT QUIET UNMYSTERIOUS GREEN GABLES GOOD EVENING RACHEL MARILLA SAID BRISKLY THIS IS A REAL FINE EVENING ISN'T IT WON'T YOU SIT DOWN
CHAPTER TWO MATTHEW CUTHBERT IS SURPRISED MATTHEW CUTHBERT AND THE SORREL MARE JOGGED COMFORTABLY OVER THE EIGHT MILES TO BRIGHT RIVER IT WAS A PRETTY ROAD RUNNING ALONG BETWEEN SNUG FARMSTEADS WITH NOW AND AGAIN A BIT OF BALSAMY FIR WOOD TO DRIVE THROUGH
A CHILD OF ABOUT ELEVEN GARBED IN A VERY SHORT VERY TIGHT VERY UGLY DRESS OF YELLOWISH GRAY WINCEY SHE WORE A FADED BROWN SAILOR HAT AND BENEATH THE HAT EXTENDING DOWN HER BACK WERE TWO BRAIDS OF VERY THICK DECIDEDLY RED HAIR
WELL MARILLA I'LL JUST TELL YOU PLAIN THAT I THINK YOU'RE DOING A MIGHTY FOOLISH THING A RISKY THING THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING YOU'RE BRINGING A STRANGE CHILD INTO YOUR HOUSE AND HOME AND YOU DON'T KNOW A SINGLE THING ABOUT HIM NOR WHAT HIS DISPOSITION IS LIKE NOR WHAT SORT OF PARENTS HE HAD
AND A BIG HAT ALL FLOWERS AND NODDING PLUMES AND A GOLD WATCH AND KID GLOVES AND BOOTS I FELT CHEERED UP RIGHT AWAY AND I ENJOYED MY TRIP TO THE ISLAND WITH ALL MY MIGHT I WASN'T A BIT SICK COMING OVER IN THE BOAT NEITHER WAS MISSUS SPENCER ALTHOUGH SHE GENERALLY IS
IT SEEMS UNCANNY TO THINK OF A CHILD AT GREEN GABLES SOMEHOW THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE THERE FOR MATTHEW AND MARILLA WERE GROWN UP WHEN THE NEW HOUSE WAS BUILT IF THEY EVER WERE CHILDREN WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THEM I WOULDN'T BE IN THAT ORPHAN'S SHOES FOR ANYTHING
WHENCE YOU GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE BLOOM WHITE CHERRY TREES IN THE LEFT ORCHARD AND NODDING SLENDER BIRCHES DOWN IN THE HOLLOW BY THE BROOK WAS GREENED OVER BY A TANGLE OF VINES HERE SAT MARILLA CUTHBERT WHEN SHE SAT AT ALL ALWAYS SLIGHTLY DISTRUSTFUL OF SUNSHINE
WHAT ON EARTH PUT SUCH A NOTION INTO YOUR HEAD SHE DEMANDED DISAPPROVINGLY THIS HAD BEEN DONE WITHOUT HER ADVICE BEING ASKED AND MUST PERFORCE BE DISAPPROVED WELL WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR SOME TIME ALL WINTER IN FACT RETURNED MARILLA
AND THEN NOVA SCOTIA IS RIGHT CLOSE TO THE ISLAND IT ISN'T AS IF WE WERE GETTING HIM FROM ENGLAND OR THE STATES HE CAN'T BE MUCH DIFFERENT FROM OURSELVES WELL I HOPE IT WILL TURN OUT ALL RIGHT SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN A TONE THAT PLAINLY INDICATED HER PAINFUL DOUBTS
HER FACE WAS SMALL WHITE AND THIN ALSO MUCH FRECKLED HER MOUTH WAS LARGE AND SO WERE HER EYES WHICH LOOKED GREEN IN SOME LIGHTS AND MOODS AND GRAY IN OTHERS SO FAR THE ORDINARY OBSERVER AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER
THERE WERE THREE PLATES LAID SO THAT MARILLA MUST BE EXPECTING SOME ONE HOME WITH MATTHEW TO TEA BUT THE DISHES WERE EVERYDAY DISHES AND THERE WAS ONLY CRAB APPLE PRESERVES AND ONE KIND OF CAKE SO THAT THE EXPECTED COMPANY COULD NOT BE ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY
I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF YOU DIDN'T COME FOR ME TO NIGHT
AS IF POISONING WELLS WERE A PURELY FEMININE ACCOMPLISHMENT AND NOT TO BE DREADED IN THE CASE OF A BOY I'D NEVER DREAM OF TAKING A GIRL TO BRING UP I WONDER AT MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER FOR DOING IT BUT THERE SHE WOULDN'T SHRINK FROM ADOPTING A WHOLE ORPHAN ASYLUM IF SHE TOOK IT INTO HER HEAD
AND SINCE SITTING AND WAITING WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO JUST THEN SHE SAT AND WAITED WITH ALL HER MIGHT AND MAIN MATTHEW ENCOUNTERED THE STATIONMASTER LOCKING UP THE TICKET OFFICE PREPARATORY TO GOING HOME FOR SUPPER AND ASKED HIM IF THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN WOULD SOON BE ALONG
SO MATTHEW AND I HAVE TALKED IT OVER OFF AND ON EVER SINCE WE THOUGHT WE'D GET A BOY MATTHEW IS GETTING UP IN YEARS YOU KNOW HE'S SIXTY AND HE ISN'T SO SPRY AS HE ONCE WAS HIS HEART TROUBLES HIM A GOOD DEAL AND YOU KNOW HOW DESPERATE HARD IT'S GOT TO BE TO GET HIRED HELP
AND A FULL SOFT BROWN BEARD WHICH HE HAD WORN EVER SINCE HE WAS TWENTY IN FACT HE HAD LOOKED AT TWENTY VERY MUCH AS HE LOOKED AT SIXTY LACKING A LITTLE OF THE GRAYNESS WHEN HE REACHED BRIGHT RIVER THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY TRAIN
ONLY A GREAT DEAL PRETTIER ALL THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WILL WANT ME TO GO AND RIDE BUT I SHAN'T NOTICE THEM AT ALL BECAUSE YOU KNOW I SHALL ALWAYS BE TEACHING IN SUNDAY SCHOOL AND VISITING THE POOR AND SOME DAY
AND THEN STILL KEEPING THE SITTING POSITION TO LET GO
I SAY BY THE PILGRIM'S PATH AND THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY SO DO I CHIMED IN CLOVER WHO ALWAYS AGREED WITH KATY THE PATH OF PEACE IS NICE SUGGESTED CECY NO NO
AND LONGED TO SET THEM A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT WHEN THE CHANCE CAME SHE GENERALLY FORGOT TO DO SO KATY'S DAYS FLEW LIKE THE WIND FOR WHEN SHE WASN'T STUDYING LESSONS OR SEWING AND DARNING WITH AUNT IZZIE WHICH SHE HATED EXTREMELY
PA SAID SO THE PATH OF PEACE GOT ITS NAME BECAUSE OF ITS DARKNESS AND COOLNESS HIGH BUSHES ALMOST MET OVER IT AND TREES KEPT IT SHADY EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY A SORT OF WHITE FLOWER GREW THERE
CLOVER HELD FAST AND WOULD NOT LET GO DOCTOR CARR WHO WASN'T ATTENDING PARTICULARLY HEARD NOTHING BUT THE PATHETIC TONE OF CLOVER'S VOICE AS SHE SAID
THE RANK WHICH HE HAD INHERITED IN THE STATE AND THE HIGH COMMAND WHICH HE HAD BORNE IN THE REBEL ARMY
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN TO DO ISN'T IT THE SAME THING ASKED CECY OH NO REPLIED KATY QUITE DIFFERENT FOR YOU SEE I MEAN TO DO SOMETHING GRAND
LITTLE PHIL THE YOUNGEST WAS FOUR AND THE REST FITTED IN BETWEEN DOCTOR CARR THEIR PAPA WAS A DEAR KIND BUSY MAN WHO WAS AWAY FROM HOME ALL DAY AND SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT TOO
JUST AS THEY WERE READY THE SIDE DOOR BANGED AND KATY AND CECY HALL CAME INTO THE YARD I MUST TELL YOU ABOUT CECY SHE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF THE CHILDREN'S AND LIVED IN A HOUSE NEXT DOOR
ME WANT DOLLY AND WITHOUT STOPPING TO INQUIRE HE CALLED OUT SHARPLY FOR SHAME KATY GIVE YOUR SISTER HER DOLL AT ONCE WHICH KATY MUCH SURPRISED DID WHILE CLOVER PURRED IN TRIUMPH
ALL I'M GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL LADY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE WORLD AND I'M GOING TO LIVE IN A YELLOW CASTLE WITH YELLOW PILLARS TO THE PORTICO AND A SQUARE THING ON TOP LIKE MISTER SAWYER'S MY CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HAVE A PLAY HOUSE UP THERE
IT WAS ONLY A LOW ROOF SET OVER A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND AS IT STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDE YARD IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO THE CHILDREN THAT THE SHORTEST ROAD TO EVERY PLACE WAS UP ONE OF ITS SLOPES AND DOWN THE OTHER
THE WINDOW ABOVE OPENED A GLAD SHRIEK WAS HEARD AND KATY'S HEAD APPEARED
HE HAD INSTIGATED MONMOUTH FIRST TO INVADE THE KINGDOM AND THEN TO USURP THE CROWN IT WAS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT A STRICT SEARCH WOULD BE MADE FOR THE ARCHTRAITOR AS HE WAS OFTEN CALLED
AM I ELIGIBLE FOR SOLID FOOD I ASKED THANKS TO ME HE SAID
WHAT SHE DID TO MAKE HERSELF GROW SO NOBODY COULD TELL BUT THERE SHE WAS UP ABOVE PAPA'S EAR AND HALF A HEAD TALLER THAN POOR AUNT IZZIE WHENEVER SHE STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT HER HEIGHT SHE BECAME VERY AWKWARD
AND FELT AS IF SHE WERE ALL LEGS AND ELBOWS AND ANGLES AND JOINTS HAPPILY HER HEAD WAS SO FULL OF OTHER THINGS OF PLANS AND SCHEMES AND FANCIES OF ALL SORTS THAT SHE DIDN'T OFTEN TAKE TIME TO REMEMBER HOW TALL SHE WAS
I MEAN TO HAVE A BLACK SILK DRESS AND PINK ROSES IN MY BONNET AND A WHITE MUSLIN LONG SHAWL SAID CECY AND I MEAN TO LOOK EXACTLY LIKE MINERVA CLARK I SHALL BE VERY GOOD TOO
THOUGH WHEN THERE'S MUCH OF A SEA WITHOUT ANY WIND
THEY WERE WHAT SHE CALLED NOT FIT TO BE SEEN THE NEIGHBORS PITIED HER VERY MUCH
AND SAY TO EACH OTHER WHAT A SIGHT OF WASHING THOSE CHILDREN MADE
OR TO SING FOR I COULDN'T TELL EXACTLY WHICH IT WAS ONE VOICE WAS SHRILL THE OTHER WHICH WAS A LITTLE DEEPER SOUNDED VERY POSITIVE AND CROSS THEY WERE EVIDENTLY DISPUTING ABOUT SOMETHING
THERE WAS A NOISE IN THE FOREST AND A DREADFUL BLACK BULL WITH FIERY EYES GALLOPED UP
LIKE A SATISFIED KITTEN CLOVER WAS SUNNY AND SWEET TEMPERED A LITTLE INDOLENT AND VERY MODEST ABOUT HERSELF THOUGH IN FACT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY CLEVER IN ALL SORTS OF GAMES
WHICH SHE WAVED TRIUMPHANTLY HURRAY SHE CRIED ALL DONE AND AUNT IZZIE SAYS WE MAY GO ARE YOU TIRED OUT WAITING
HE HAD WRITTEN THAT DECLARATION WHICH FOR INSOLENCE MALIGNITY AND MENDACITY
THEN SANTA CLAUS WAKED UP THE FAIRY AND TOLD HER THAT IF SHE DIDN'T TAKE BETTER CARE OF ROSY POSY HE SHOULD PUT SOME OTHER FAIRY INTO HER PLACE AND SET HER TO KEEP GUARD OVER A PRICKLY SCRATCHY BLACKBERRY BUSH
THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SO LONG AS I WAS THERE BUT THE MOMENT MY BACK WAS TURNED THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL AGAIN AND IN THE SAME OLD WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T
IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE CONTINUED KATY IN A MYSTERIOUS TONE THE FAIRY OF THE ROSARY WAS QUITE SICK SHE HAD TAKEN A DREADFUL COLD IN HER HEAD AND THE POPLAR TREE FAIRY JUST OVER THERE
POOR KATY ALWAYS SAID WHEN I'M GROWN UP FORGETTING HOW VERY MUCH SHE HAD GROWN ALREADY PERHAPS SHE WENT ON IT WILL BE ROWING OUT IN BOATS AND SAVING PEOPLES LIVES LIKE THAT GIRL IN THE BOOK
EVEN BABY VOTES AND STAR EYED CHILDREN IN WHOSE INNOCENT FACES KINDLES THE GLADNESS WHICH WAS ONCE OUR OWN CROWD ROUND OUR KNEES WITH SWEET AND COAXING VOICES ASKING FOR STORIES OF THAT OLD TIME HOME
I SHALL WEAR GOLD DRESSES AND SILVER DRESSES EVERY DAY AND DIAMOND RINGS AND HAVE WHITE SATIN APRONS TO TIE ON WHEN I'M DUSTING OR DOING ANYTHING DIRTY IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACK YARD
PEOPLE VERY OFTEN SAY AFTERWARD THAT THEY ALWAYS KNEW CONCLUDED KATY SAGACIOUSLY OH KATY HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WILL BE SAID CLOVER CLASPING HER HANDS CLOVER BELIEVED IN KATY AS SHE DID IN THE BIBLE
LEST SOME HUNGRY COW SHOULD TAKE A FANCY TO THE ROSE BUSH AND EAT IT UP YES SAID KATY STROKING A LEAF WITH HER FINGER IT WAS IN GREAT DANGER ONE NIGHT LAST WINTER BUT IT ESCAPED
WHERE SAID I IT'S AN ISLAND WHERE I LIVE SO FAR AS I KNOW IT HASN'T GOT A NAME HE STARED AT ME WITH HIS NETHER LIP DROPPING AND LOOKED SO WILFULLY STUPID OF A SUDDEN
SHE WAS A DEAR LOVING CHILD FOR ALL HER CARELESS HABITS AND MADE BUSHELS OF GOOD RESOLUTIONS EVERY WEEK OF HER LIFE ONLY UNLUCKILY SHE NEVER KEPT ANY OF THEM SHE HAD FITS OF RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT THE OTHER CHILDREN
HE TOLD ME CASUALLY THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS THREE PARTS DRUNK IN HIS OWN CABIN AS I ASSUMED THE CLOTHES
JAMES HAD WATCHED THE CIRCUIT WITH INTEREST AND DELIGHT IN HIS DRAWINGROOM AND AT HIS TABLE
AND ENCOURAGED CLIMBING AND ROUGH PLAYS IN SPITE OF THE BUMPS AND RAGGED CLOTHES WHICH RESULTED IN FACT THERE WAS JUST ONE HALF HOUR OF THE DAY WHEN AUNT IZZIE WAS REALLY SATISFIED ABOUT HER CHARGES AND THAT WAS THE HALF HOUR BEFORE BREAKFAST
NARROW WINDING PATHS RAN HERE AND THERE MADE BY THE CATTLE AS THEY WANDERED TO AND FRO THIS PLACE THE CHILDREN CALLED PARADISE AND TO THEM
YES I SAID WITH ASSURANCE I COULD EAT SOME MUTTON BUT SAID HE WITH A MOMENTARY HESITATION YOU KNOW I'M DYING TO HEAR OF HOW YOU CAME TO BE ALONE IN THAT BOAT DAMN THAT HOWLING
CLOVER IS GOING TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE WORLD BUT I'LL BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WERE SEVEN LITTLE PIES MOLASSES PIES BAKED IN SAUCERS EACH WITH A BROWN TOP AND CRISP CANDIFIED EDGE
AND THEN YOU COULD ALL COME AND LIVE WITH ME AND WE WOULD PLAY IN THE GARDEN AND DORRY SHOULD HAVE TURKEY FIVE TIMES A DAY IF HE LIKED AND WE'D HAVE A MACHINE TO DARN THE STOCKINGS AND ANOTHER MACHINE TO PUT THE BUREAU DRAWERS IN ORDER
WHICH ALWAYS LOOKED READY TO LAUGH THESE TWO WERE GREAT FRIENDS THOUGH DORRY SEEMED LIKE A GIRL WHO HAD GOT INTO BOY'S CLOTHES BY MISTAKE AND JOHNNIE LIKE A BOY WHO IN A FIT OF FUN HAD BORROWED HIS SISTER'S FROCK
TWO RED ONES A YELLOW ONE WITH SHARP HORNS TIPPED WITH TIN AND A DEAR LITTLE WHITE ONE NAMED DAISY THERE WERE SIX OF THE CARR CHILDREN FOUR GIRLS AND TWO BOYS KATY THE OLDEST WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
ALWAYS NEVER AUNTY BOYS AND GIRLS WILL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE LITTLE CARRS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD EVER HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
I THINK I SAID I FELT ALL RIGHT
THEY WERE FOREVER ESTABLISHING IN ALL SORTS OF HIDDEN PLACES BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT ELSIE AND USED TO TELL HER TO RUN AWAY AND PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN WHICH HURT HER FEELINGS VERY MUCH WHEN SHE WOULDN'T RUN AWAY
WHEREAS KATY TORE HER DRESS EVERY DAY HATED SEWING AND DIDN'T CARE A BUTTON ABOUT BEING CALLED GOOD WHILE CLOVER AND ELSIE SHIED OFF LIKE RESTLESS PONIES WHEN ANY ONE TRIED TO PAT THEIR HEADS IT WAS VERY PERPLEXING TO AUNT IZZIE
LIKE GREAT SWANS WENT FLOATING OVER IT TO AND FRO JUST OPPOSITE ME WAS A CLUMP OF GREEN RUSHES WITH DARK VELVETY SPIKES AND AMONG THEM ONE SINGLE TALL RED CARDINAL FLOWER WHICH WAS BENDING OVER THE BROOK
ALMOST WE START FORGETFUL FOR A MOMENT ALMOST WE ANSWER
I DON'T BELIEVE THE NEWSPAPERS WOULD BE SO SILLY AS TO PRINT THINGS ABOUT YOU KATY CARR PUT IN ELSIE VINDICTIVELY YES THEY WILL SAID CLOVER AND GAVE ELSIE A PUSH
HE MUST HAVE SEEN THE QUESTION IN MY FACE FOR MY VOICE WAS INACCESSIBLE TO ME YOU WERE PICKED UP IN A BOAT STARVING THE NAME ON THE BOAT WAS THE LADY VAIN
THERE'S YOUR OLD POST OFFICE BUT FEELING ALL THE TIME JUST LIKE CRYING POOR LITTLE ELSIE IN ALMOST EVERY BIG FAMILY THERE IS ONE OF THESE UNMATED LEFT OUT CHILDREN KATY
AND A BLISSFUL STICKINESS PERVADED THE PARTY
WAVED A WILD ROSE BUSH BUDDED OVER WITH FRESH GREEN EAVES THIS ROSARY WAS A FASCINATING THING TO THEIR MINDS THEY WERE ALWAYS INVENTING STORIES ABOUT IT AND WERE IN CONSTANT TERROR
HAVE SOME OF THIS SAID HE AND GAVE ME A DOSE OF SOME SCARLET STUFF ICED IT TASTED LIKE BLOOD AND MADE ME FEEL STRONGER YOU WERE IN LUCK SAID HE
SHE WAS AS HEEDLESS AND INNOCENT AS A CHILD OF SIX
SHOES AND TROUSERS AND CLOTHES GENERALLY WERE AUNT IZZIE'S AFFAIR THEIRS WAS TO SLIDE AND ENJOY THEMSELVES CLOVER NEXT IN AGE TO KATY
BRINGING UP THE REAR OH THERE IS THE DEAR ROSARY ALL SAFE CRIED THE CHILDREN AS THEY REACHED THE TOP OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY AND CAME UPON A TALL STUMP
LEFT IT ALL HE SAID TEN YEARS AGO HOW JOLLY IT ALL USED TO BE BUT I MADE A YOUNG ASS OF MYSELF
SO IN THEY MARCHED KATY AND CECY HEADING THE PROCESSION
YET HIS CRUELTY WAS NOT MORE ODIOUS THAN HIS MERCY OR PERHAPS IT MAY BE MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT HIS MERCY AND HIS CRUELTY WERE SUCH THAT EACH REFLECTS INFAMY ON THE OTHER OUR HORROR AT THE FATE OF THE SIMPLE CLOWNS THE YOUNG LADS
THE DELICATE WOMEN TO WHOM HE WAS INEXORABLY SEVERE
AS I WALKED HOME I FELL TO THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER KATY A KATY I ONCE KNEW
AS IF TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE EATEN I DON'T KNOW REPLIED KATY DREAMILY SHE HAD LEFT HER SEAT
A WEATHER BEATEN COTTAGE NEARLY HIDDEN BY THE PEPPER AND ACACIA TREES THAT SURROUND IT
AND COULD NOW GIVE VERY FAIR ORDERS AND HIS FURIOUS PURSUIT OF BLACKBEARD HAD ALSO GIVEN HIM A REPUTATION FOR RECKLESS BRAVERY WHICH HE HAD NOT ENJOYED BEFORE A MAN WHO WAS
FOR SAINT THOMAS WHICH WAS A BRITISH NAVAL STATION AND WHERE HE DECLARED HE WAS GOING IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A COMMISSION AS A PRIVATEER NOW THE WILY
HE WAS A LOYAL AND LAW ABIDING SUBJECT OF GREAT BRITAIN
AND FALLEN INTO THE OCEAN ONLY THE PROMPT ACTION OF A FRIEND WHO SCRAMBLED DOWN THE ROCKS AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE SAVED HIM
IF THE GREEN PIRATE CHOSE TO GO TO SEA AGAIN AND PERHAPS DROWN HIMSELF AND HIS CREW IT WAS A MATTER OF NO CONCERN TO BLACKBEARD BUT THIS WAS A MATTER OF VERY GREAT CONCERN TO STEDE BONNET
THROUGH A WEALTH OF TANGLED GRASSES PAST A GROVE OF LIVE OAKS FROM WHOSE TWISTED AND CONTORTED LIMBS THE GRAY MOSS HANGS IN LONG FESTOONS BY INDIAN PAINTBRUSH
WHOM HE HAD NEVER FORGIVEN FOR THE SHAMEFUL AND TREACHEROUS MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD TREATED HIM WAS STILL ON SHORE ENJOYING HIMSELF BUT HE WAS TOLD BY THE CAPTAIN OF A SMALL TRADING VESSEL THAT THE OLD PIRATE WAS PREPARING FOR ANOTHER CRUISE
ENOUGH WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS HE CAPTURED A SMALL SLOOP BELONGING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BROKE IT UP IN ORDER TO GET THE MATERIAL HE NEEDED TO MAKE HIS OWN VESSEL SEAWORTHY
BY THE SON OF JAMES THE SECOND WHO WAS A PRETENDER TO THE THRONE
FOR THE ROCKS BELOW ROSE UP LIKE DRAGON'S TEETH READY TO IMPALE US IF WE SHOULD MAKE A FALSE STEP
AND AGREED TO HOIST THE SKULL AND CROSS BONES AND TO FOLLOW CAPTAIN BONNET WHEREVER HE MIGHT LEAD BONNET NOW CRUISED ABOUT IN GRAND STYLE AND TOOK SOME PRIZES
SOME PREFER THE SMOOTH STRETCH OF SANDY BEACH WHERE ONE MAY LIE AT LUXURIOUS EASE IN THE WARM SAND AND LISTEN TO THE WAVES LAPPING ALONG SHORE OR DISCARDING SHOES AND STOCKINGS
GLEAMING LIKE SPARKS OF FIRE AMID THE GREEN AND BRONZE FOLIAGE IT GLIDES AT LAST INTO A SOMBER CANON
CONTENTEDLY A YELLOW DOG TRUE COMPANIONS OF THE HIGHWAY ARE THEY FOR NO COUNTRY ROAD WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT ITS BOY AND DOG AND AS I PASS THEM I CALL BACK GOOD LUCK MY DOUGHTY FISHERMAN
FARTHER ON WHERE THE ROCKS DESCEND TO THE SEA LEVEL WE ROAM THE BEACH AND GATHER SEA SHELLS STARFISH AND SEA URCHINS AND BY A SHALLOW POOL WE STOP TO WATCH THE SCARLET
IN THE LIGHT OF YOUR DRIFTWOOD FIRE A DAY AT THE SEASHORE IS ONE OF PLEASURE A DELIGHTFUL CHANGE FROM WOODS AND UPLANDS TO ROCKS AND RUSHING WATERS
FAR OUT THE LIGHTHOUSE STANDS ANCHORED TO THE ROCKS THE WAVES DASHING AGAINST IT AS IF TO TEAR IT FROM ITS FIRM FOUNDATION BUT IT DEFIES THEM ALL AND SENDS THE CHEERY BEACON LIGHT
HAVING NO INTENTION OF RESPECTING HIS OATHS OR OF KEEPING HIS PROMISES HE THOUGHT THAT AS HE WAS GOING TO BE DISLOYAL HE MIGHT AS WELL BE AS DISLOYAL
HE WISHED TO GO PIRATING AGAIN AND SAW A WAY OF DOING THIS WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD BE FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY OF THE COMMON METHODS IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT KING GEORGE OF ENGLAND
HE KNEW OF A DESERT ISLAND NOT VERY FAR AWAY WHERE BLACKBEARD AT THE END OF HIS LAST CRUISE HAD MAROONED A LARGE PARTY OF HIS MEN THIS HEARTLESS PIRATE HAD NOT WANTED TO TAKE ALL OF HIS FOLLOWERS INTO PORT
AND SUCH A PLACE IS LAND'S END NEAR THE GOLDEN GATE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE STARTED DOWN THE STEEP INCLINE STREWN WITH JAGGED ROCKS
ON THE VIRGINIA COAST AND THEN WENT UP INTO DELAWARE BAY WHERE HE CAPTURED SUCH SHIPS AS HE WANTED AND ACTED GENERALLY IN THE MOST DOMINEERING AND INSOLENT FASHION ONCE WHEN HE STOPPED NEAR THE TOWN OF LEWES
OR NODDING SILKEN HEADS SCATTER THEIR TINY FLEET OF A HUNDRED FAIRY BALLOONS UPON THE WINGS OF THE SUMMER WINDS DOWN THE ROAD WHISTLING BLITHELY COMES A SLIP OF A BOY
TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO GIVE UP HIS PIRATICAL INTENTION OR TO DECLINE TO JOIN HIM IN CARRYING IT OUT SO THE WHOLE OF THE CREW MINOR OFFICERS AND MEN CHANGED THEIR MINDS ABOUT GOING TO SAINT THOMAS
OF TWO ATROCIOUS VILLAINS AND CAPTAIN MAYNARD WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE HONOR OF HAVING SLAIN THE MOST FAMOUS PIRATE OF THE DAY
A PIECE OF WRECKAGE IS THROWN UPON THE BEACH AND YOU WONDER WHAT DIRE DISASTER HAPPENED FAR OUT AT SEA AND IF THE REST OF THE SHIP WENT TO THE BOTTOM WITH ALL ON BOARD
HE OBEYED THE ORDERS OF HIS USURPING PARTNER BECAUSE HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO SO BUT HE DID NOT HATE BLACKBEARD ANY THE LESS BECAUSE HE HAD TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT IT HE ACCOMPANIED HIS PIRATE CHIEF ON VARIOUS CRUISES
HE WAS NOT GOING FORTH TO PREY UPON UNRESISTING MERCHANTMEN HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO PUNISH A BLACK HEARTED PIRATE A FAITHLESS SCOUNDREL WHO HAD NOT ONLY ACTED
CHAFING AND FUMING FOR A CHANCE OF A HAND TO HAND CONFLICT WITH THE GREATEST PIRATE OF THE DAY
AND THE BALSAMIC TARWEED SPREADS ITS FRAGRANCE ALONG THE OUTER EDGE THREADING ITS WAY DOWN A STEEP HILL
THAT HE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE TRIFLED WITH AND SENT HIM THE MESSAGE THAT IF HE DID NOT KEEP CLOSE TO THE ROYAL JAMES HE WOULD FIRE INTO HIM AND SINK HIM TO THE BOTTOM
HAUNTED US LIKE A SPECTER THE PATH ALONG THE OCEAN IS A NARROW AND TORTUOUS ONE RUNNING ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE TOP OF THE CLIFF GREAT GRANITE ROCKS RISE UP LIKE GIANTS
HIS VESSEL WITHOUT MOLESTATION IF HE HAD BOUGHT AND PAID FOR THE PLANKS AND TIMBER HE REQUIRED BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BOLDLY SEIZING THEIR PROPERTY
TO GOLD FROM GOLD TO PURPLE AND THROUGH THE GATHERING DUSK THE ROAD SINKS INTO THE SURROUNDING GLOOM
BUT HAD BEHAVED MOST DISLOYALLY AND DISRESPECTFULLY TOWARD A FELLOW PIRATE CHIEF IF HE COULD ONCE RUN THE REVENGE ALONGSIDE THE SHIP OF THE PERFIDIOUS BLACKBEARD HE WOULD SHOW HIM WHAT A GREEN HAND COULD DO
WITH FISHING ROD CUT FROM THE ADJACENT THICKET OVER HIS SHOULDER AND A CAN OF BAIT TUCKED SECURELY UNDER HIS ARM HAPPY AS A KING IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FISH HE MAY NEVER CATCH AT HIS HEELS TROTS
POURS FORTH A PERFECT RHAPSODY OF MELODY AT THIS PLACE A HILL ENCROACHES UPON THE ROAD AT THE RIGHT COVERED THICKLY WITH UNDERBRUSH AND BLACKBERRY VINES ITS CREST
NOW THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST VERY SELDOM INTERFERED WITH PIRATES AS WE HAVE SEEN AND IT IS LIKELY THAT BONNET MIGHT HAVE STAYED IN PORT AS LONG AS HE PLEASED AND REPAIRED AND REFITTED
VERY DESIROUS OF BREAKING UP PIRACY ISSUED A PROCLAMATION IN WHICH HE PROMISED PARDON TO ANY PIRATE WHO WOULD APPEAR BEFORE THE PROPER AUTHORITIES RENOUNCE HIS EVIL PRACTICES AND TAKE AN OATH OF ALLEGIANCE
TO WRITE THAT BEAUTIFUL POEM CONTAINING THE LINES LET ME LIVE IN A HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND BE A FRIEND TO MAN FOR THE COOLING DRAUGHT PASSED OUT TO ME ONE HOT AFTERNOON FROM THIS HOUSE
AND THE ROAD ANSWERS
WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THEIR CAPTAINS TO FIGHT OUT THEIR PRIVATE QUARREL WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FOR PIRATES DELIGHT IN A BLOODY SPECTACLE AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TO THEM A RARE DIVERSION OF THE KIND
AFTER A TIME BONNET PUT INTO A NORTH CAROLINA PORT IN ORDER TO REPAIR THE ROYAL JAMES WHICH WAS BECOMING VERY LEAKY AND SEEING NO IMMEDIATE LEGITIMATE WAY OF GETTING PLANKS AND BEAMS
NEVER BEFORE HAD HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENGING HIMSELF ON ANYBODY BUT NOW THAT HOUR HAD ARRIVED HE WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF UPON BLACKBEARD THE IMPLACABLE BONNET SAILED OUT TO SEA
WE TURN OUR FACES HOMEWARD
COULD PREVENT ANOTHER VISITATION OF THE PIRATES THAT EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE
THEN AFTER THIS THE BLUSTERING CAPTAIN CAPTURED TWO VALUABLE SLOOPS AND WISHING TO TAKE THEM ALONG WITH HIM WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF TRANSFERRING THEIR CARGOES TO HIS OWN VESSEL
AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT SAIL A SHIP HE UNDERSTOOD THE USE OF THE SWORD EVEN BETTER PERHAPS THAN BLACKBEARD AND THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IF THE TWO SHIPS HAD COME TOGETHER THEIR RESPECTIVE CREWS
I AM TOLD BY ONE WHO OUGHT TO KNOW FOR HE IS AN OLD RESIDENT THAT IF YOU FOLLOW ITS TORTUOUS COURSE FAR ENOUGH IT WILL LEAD YOU TO A TOWN CALLED
SWEEPING ONWARD AS IF CHALLENGING THE ROCKS TO MORTAL COMBAT ITS MIGHTY CURVING CREST WHITE AND SEETHING WITH FOAM
AND COMPLAINTS OF BONNET'S BEHAVIOR SPREAD FROM SETTLEMENT TO SETTLEMENT AND IT VERY SOON BECAME KNOWN ALL DOWN THE COAST THAT THERE WAS A PIRATE IN NORTH CAROLINA WHO WAS COMMITTING DEPREDATIONS
ON A TULLE STEM WHILE REPEATING OVER AND OVER HIS PLEASANT
IN ORDER TO SEND SOME PRISONERS ASHORE HE SENT A MESSAGE TO THE OFFICERS OF THE TOWN TO THE EFFECT THAT IF THEY INTERFERED WITH HIS MEN WHEN THEY CAME ASHORE HE WOULD OPEN FIRE UPON THE TOWN WITH HIS CANNON
IT HAD NOT BEEN LONG SINCE BLACKBEARD HAD VISITED THEIR HARBOR AND HAD TREATED THEM WITH SUCH BRUTAL INSOLENCE
HE PUT INTO AN INLET IN NORTH CAROLINA WHERE HE DISBANDED HIS CREW SO LONG AS HE WAS ON SHORE SPENDING HIS MONEY AND HAVING A GOOD TIME HE DID NOT WANT TO HAVE A LOT OF MEN ABOUT HIM WHO WOULD LOOK TO HIM TO SUPPORT THEM
WAVING BACK AND FORTH WITH THE ACTION OF THE TIDE BARNACLES COVER THE TOP OF EVERY ROCK THAT THE TIDE REACHES AND THE LONG BLACKISH SNAKELIKE SEAWEED IS STREWN ALONG THE BEACH
AMONG WHICH WAS THE FAMOUS EXPEDITION TO THE HARBOR OF CHARLES TOWN WHERE BLACKBEARD TRADED MISTER WRAGG AND HIS COMPANIONS
AND HILLSIDE THE SOFT LIGHT OF EVENING TOUCHES THE TOPS OF TREE AND SHRUB WITH A ROSY SPLENDOR
NOD TO IT FROM THE MEADOW AND THE LAVENDER SNAP DRAGONS WAVE THEIR THREADLIKE FINGERS IN SILENT GREETING TALL STATELY TEASELS STAND LIKE SENTINELS ALONG THE WAY
AGAINST WARLIKE INTRUDERS TWO HARDY FISHERMEN HAVE VENTURED OUT AT LOW TIDE TO A LARGE ROCK AND ARE CASTING THEIR LINES INTO THE BOILING WATERS FOR ROCK COD OR PORGIES
THAT SHE DARE NOT TRUST HERSELF TO OFFER HER THE FIRST MOTHERLY EMBRACE IRENE PERCEIVING THE GREAT EMBARRASSMENT OF HER BELOVED LADY DILWORTH GLIDED ACROSS THE ROOM
THE GOBLINS WOULD HAVE TORN THEM ALL TO PIECES BUT THE KING HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO CARRY THEM AWAY ALIVE AND OVER EACH OF THEM IN TWELVE GROUPS WAS STANDING A KNOT OF GOBLINS WHILE AS MANY AS COULD FIND ROOM WERE SITTING UPON THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES
OR HAD SHE ONLY HINTED TO LADY DILWORTH HER MANIFEST INABILITY TO RETURN SIR JOHN'S GREAT AFFECTION MATTERS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REACHED ANOTHER CLIMAX BUT OWING TO THE PRESENT PRECARIOUS POSITION IN WHICH LORD AND LADY DILWORTH STOOD
THE BISHOP OF BARELEGS AND CANON FOOT WITH HIGHLY IMPRESSED AND OPEN FALSEHOOD AS THAT PRACTISED BY HER IN THE ABSENCE OF LABOURING UNDER SUCH A SOLEMN VOW WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BREATHLESS SURPRISE
HER BELOVED BENEFACTORS WHO HAD BEEN THE PRIME MOVERS IN THE MATTER OF MATRIMONY SAW PLAINLY A SADDENED LOOK ABOUT THE LOVELY FACE
PERSONS OF HIGH RANK WERE INSTANTLY DESPATCHED FROM VERSAILLES TO GREET AND ESCORT HIM MEANWHILE LEWIS ATTENDED BY HIS FAMILY AND HIS NOBILITY WENT FORTH IN STATE TO RECEIVE THE EXILED QUEEN
AND STILL MORE OUT OF HUMOUR WITH ITS NATURAL CHIEF
AS BEFORE STATED FEW WERE THOSE INVITED TO BE PRESENT AT THE WEDDING CEREMONY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK NOON SIR JOHN ARRIVED AT THE CASTLE SHORTLY BEFORE THAT TIME LOOKING CHARMING INDEED
TOOK THE DRESSING FROM HIS LEG RUBBED IT WITH SOMETHING THAT SMELT LIKE ROSES AND THEN WAVED HER HANDS OVER HIM THREE TIMES AT THE LAST WAVE OF HER HANDS EVERYTHING VANISHED HE FELT HIMSELF SINKING INTO THE PROFOUNDEST SLUMBER
HE TOOK THE UNCEREMONIOUS LEAVE OF AN OLD FRIEND IN A FEW HOURS THE ROYAL PAIR WERE INFORMED THAT AS LONG AS THEY WOULD DO THE KING OF FRANCE THE FAVOUR TO ACCEPT OF HIS HOSPITALITY
THE SETTING MOON WAS THROWING A FEEBLE LIGHT THROUGH THE CASEMENT AND THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF UPROAR THERE WAS SOFT HEAVY MULTITUDINOUS STAMPING A CLASHING AND CLANGING OF WEAPONS THE VOICES OF MEN AND THE CRIES OF WOMEN MIXED WITH A HIDEOUS BELLOWING
WAS DEADLY SO TO OSCAR BUT FUTURE FACTS HAD TO BE SOLVED WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY WOULD BE TREATED WITH MORE COMPARATIVE REVERENCE THAN HERETOFORE BY HIM WHO SUFFERED SEVERELY
FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE EXPEDITION SAILED THE ANXIETY OF THE WHOLE DUTCH NATION HAD BEEN INTENSE NEVER HAD THERE BEEN SUCH CROWDS IN THE CHURCHES NEVER HAD THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PREACHERS BEEN SO ARDENT
IN WHICH WERE VESSELS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FROM SAUCE PAN TO SILVER CUP PRESSING AROUND THE BUTLER WHO SAT AT THE TAP OF A HUGE CASK FILLING AND FILLING CURDIE CAST ONE GLANCE AROUND THE PLACE BEFORE COMMENCING HIS ATTACK
HARELIP WITH ANOTHER COMPANY HAD GONE OFF TO SEARCH THE HOUSE THEY CAPTURED EVERY ONE THEY MET AND WHEN THEY COULD FIND NO MORE THEY HURRIED AWAY TO CARRY THEM SAFE TO THE CAVERNS BELOW BUT WHEN THE BUTLER WHO WAS AMONGST THEM FOUND THAT THEIR PATH LAY THROUGH THE WINE CELLAR
HERE IS A GENTLEMAN SAID LEWIS TO MARY WHOM YOU WILL BE GLAD TO SEE THEN AFTER ENTREATING HIS GUESTS TO VISIT HIM NEXT DAY AT VERSAILLES AND TO LET HIM HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING THEM HIS BUILDINGS PICTURES AND PLANTATIONS
DID LADY DUNFERN EVER DREAM THAT HER APOLOGY FOR DISOBEDIENCE TO LADY DILWORTH'S ORDERS IN NOT ARRAYING HERSELF IN THE GARB OF GLISTENING GLORY COULD EVER BE ACCEPTED EVEN BY THE KIND AND LOVING LADY DILWORTH
THE ONLY APPLAUSE BY WHICH HIS STOICAL NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN STRONGLY MOVED WAS THE APPLAUSE OF HIS DEAR NATIVE COUNTRY OF HIS IMMENSE POPULARITY IN ENGLAND HE SPOKE WITH COLD DISDAIN
ONLY SEVEN DAYS AND THUS SHALL END MY CHERISHED HOPES MY GIRLISH PRIDE MY MOST ARDENT WISH BUT ALAS NOT MY LOVE SEVEN DAYS MORE SHALL SEE MY OWN DARLING OS SUDDENLY
THE GOBLINS IN THE KING'S HOUSE WHEN CURDIE FELL ASLEEP HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO DREAM HE THOUGHT HE WAS ASCENDING THE MOUNTAINSIDE FROM THE MOUTH OF THE MINE
FOR HE HAD SOON FOUND THEIR HEADS ALL BUT INVULNERABLE THE QUEEN HAD ATTACKED HIS LEGS AND FEET WITH HER HORRIBLE GRANITE SHOE AND HE WAS SOON DOWN BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD GOT HIS BACK TO THE WALL AND STOOD OUT LONGER
NONE OF THEM COULD GIVE THE LEAST INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PRINCESS LOOTIE WAS ALMOST SILLY WITH TERROR AND ALTHOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO WALK WOULD NOT LEAVE CURDIE'S SIDE FOR A SINGLE MOMENT AGAIN HE ALLOWED THE OTHERS TO SEARCH THE REST OF THE HOUSE
TO BESTOW UPON HER HIS CHOICE COLLECTION OF LOVE'S PUREST FRAGRANCE WHICH SHOULD CAST THE SWEETEST SCENT OF MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP THROUGHOUT THE DAZZLING APARTMENTS OF THE MANSION SHE WAS ABOUT TO GRACE
WHEN HE CAME UPON A WOMAN AND CHILD WHO HAD LOST THEIR WAY AND FROM THAT POINT HE WENT ON DREAMING EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE HE THUS MET THE PRINCESS AND LOOTIE HOW HE HAD WATCHED THE GOBLINS HOW HE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THEM
AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE HALL WAS NEARLY EMPTY THE GOBLINS RUNNING FROM IT AS FAST AS THEY COULD HOWLING AND SHRIEKING AND LIMPING AND COWERING EVERY NOW AND THEN AS THEY RAN TO CUDDLE THEIR WOUNDED FEET IN THEIR HARD HANDS OR TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE FRIGHTFUL STAMP STAMP OF THE ARMED MEN
BETTER LEAVE HER TO THE FREEDOM OF A WILL THAT ERE LONG WOULD SINK THE SHIP OF OPULENCE IN THE SEA OF PENURY AND WRING FROM HER THE WORDS LEAVE ME NOW DECEPTIVE DEMON OF DELUDED MOCKERY
HE WHO HAD HITHERTO ON ALL QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENCE BEEN SENSITIVE LITIGIOUS INSOLENT WHO HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONCE READY TO PLUNGE EUROPE INTO WAR RATHER THAN CONCEDE THE MOST FRIVOLOUS POINT OF ETIQUETTE
TEN THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING WERE SENT FOR OUTFIT THE LIBERALITY OF LEWIS HOWEVER
SOON HOWEVER THE MAGNIFICENT KING CONCEIVED AN INEXPLICABLE DISGUST FOR HIS BIRTHPLACE HE QUITTED SAINT GERMAINS FOR VERSAILLES AND EXPENDED SUMS ALMOST FABULOUS IN THE VAIN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A PARADISE
ON A SPOT SINGULARLY STERILE AND UNWHOLESOME ALL SAND OR MUD WITHOUT WOOD WITHOUT WATER AND WITHOUT GAME SAINT GERMAINS HAD NOW BEEN SELECTED TO BE THE ABODE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY OF ENGLAND
WAS NOW PUNCTILIOUS INDEED BUT PUNCTILIOUS FOR HIS UNFORTUNATE FRIENDS AGAINST HIMSELF HE GAVE ORDERS THAT MARY SHOULD RECEIVE ALL THE MARKS OF RESPECT THAT HAD EVER BEEN PAID TO HIS OWN DECEASED WIFE
AND CURDIE HAD NO LONGER ANY DOUBT THAT SHE HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AT THE VERY FIRST OF THE INROAD WITH A PANG OF DESPAIR HE SAW HOW WRONG THEY HAD BEEN IN NOT SECURING THE KING AND QUEEN AND PRINCE
THE INTENSE EXCITEMENT THAT FOR WEEKS BEFORE HAD FOUND SUCH REFUGE WITHIN THEIR CHERISHED AND MUCH LOVED HOME
HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF PERSUADING THEM TO TASTE THE WINE AND AS HE HAD HOPED THEY NO SOONER TASTED THAN THEY WANTED MORE THE ROUTED GOBLINS ON THEIR WAY BELOW JOINED THEM AND WHEN CURDIE ENTERED THEY WERE ALL WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS
THE NOISE GREW AS HIS SHARP EARS GUIDED HIM TO A STAIR AND SO TO THE WINE CELLAR IT WAS FULL OF GOBLINS WHOM THE BUTLER WAS SUPPLYING WITH WINE AS FAST AS HE COULD DRAW IT WHILE THE QUEEN AND HER PARTY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE MEN AT ARMS
WAS ABSOLUTELY REGULATED BY THEIR SOVEREIGN BUT IT WAS BEYOND EVEN HIS POWER TO PREVENT THEM FROM THINKING FREELY AND FROM EXPRESSING WHAT THEY THOUGHT IN PRIVATE CIRCLES WITH THE KEEN AND DELICATE WIT CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIR NATION AND OF THEIR ORDER
WOULD THERE BE ANY MEANS OF FLIGHT FROM THE DANGEROUS DRAGON THAT HAUNTS ME NIGHT AND DAY COULD ANYTHING POSSIBLE BE DONE TO SAVE MYSELF FROM FALSE ALLIANCE TOO LATE TOO LATE
DID SHE IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE TO WHOM SHE OWED ANYTHING BUT DISOBEDIENCE EVEN IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM SHOULD BE WRESTED FROM HER ARMS OF COMPANIONSHIP ERE HER RETURN TO DUNFERN MANSION
THUS WERE JOINED TWO HEARTS OF WIDELY DIFFERENT BEAT ONE OF INTENSE LOVE WHICH HEARSAY NEVER COULD SHAKE THE OTHER OF DIRE DISLIKE WHICH REASON COULD NEVER ALTER BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR
THE ELECTIONS WENT ON RAPIDLY AND SMOOTHLY THERE WERE SCARCELY ANY CONTESTS FOR THE NATION HAD DURING MORE THAN A YEAR BEEN KEPT IN CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF A PARLIAMENT WRITS INDEED HAD BEEN TWICE ISSUED AND TWICE RECALLED
THE UNFORTUNATE EXILE BOWED SO LOW THAT IT SEEMED AS IF HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE THE KNEES OF HIS PROTECTOR LEWIS RAISED HIM AND EMBRACED HIM WITH BROTHERLY TENDERNESS THE TWO KINGS THEN ENTERED THE QUEEN'S ROOM
TAKEN ON HIMSELF THE EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION A GENERAL CRY OF PRIDE AND JOY ROSE FROM ALL THE DUTCH FACTIONS AN EXTRAORDINARY MISSION WAS WITH GREAT SPEED DESPATCHED TO CONGRATULATE HIM
YEA ACUTELY FROM THE BLOW STRUCK HIM ON THE EVE OF ASPIRATION AND ACHIEVEMENT LOVE ALAS WHEN SMITTEN WITH THE SWORD OF INDIFFERENCE DIETH SOON BUT ONCE STRUCK ON THE TUNNELLED CHEEK OF SECRECY WITH THE HAND OF PITY
CHAPTER SIX THE SILVERY TOUCH OF FORTUNE IS TOO OFTEN GILT WITH BETRAYAL THE MEDDLING MOUTH OF EXTRAVAGANCE SWALLOWS EVERY DESIRE AND EATS THE HEART OF HONESTY WITH PICKLED PRIDE
AND SITTING DOWN TO THE RIGHT OF HER UPON WHOM SHE HAD THAT DAY FLUNG IN THE FACE OF DEVOTION THE LAST DREGS OF DEFIANCE BEGGED TO OFFER AN APOLOGY FOR SUCH UNRULY CONDUCT AND ADDED
BUT THAT MANY MORE GOBLIN FEET HAD TO GO LIMPING BACK OVER THE UNDERGROUND WAYS OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT MORNING PRESENTLY HOWEVER THEY WERE REINFORCED FROM ABOVE BY THE KING AND HIS PARTY WITH THE REDOUBTABLE QUEEN AT THEIR HEAD
OF LADY DILWORTH CHIEFLY AND THOSE PRESENT ALSO WHO ONLY THE EVENING PREVIOUS HAD BEEN POURING SUCH PRAISES OVER THE MAGNIFICENT DUCHESSE SATIN GOWN
BEFORE HIS GORGEOUS COACH WENT THE SWISS HALBERDIERS ON EACH SIDE OF IT AND BEHIND IT RODE THE BODY GUARDS WITH CYMBALS CLASHING AND TRUMPETS PEALING
AND NOW CURDIE APPROACHED THE GROUP WHICH IN TRUSTING IN THE QUEEN AND HER SHOE KEPT THEIR GUARD OVER THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN
THERE LEAVES A SCAR OF INDELIBLE INTOLERANCE UNTIL WIPED OUT FOR EVER WITH THE CURATIVE BALSAM OF BATTLED FREEDOM SIR JOHN AND IRENE MET IN DILWORTH CASTLE FOR THE LAST TIME ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY OF AUGUST
AND NEVER BETTER EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN THE PRESENT EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS
EMBLEMS OF THE APPROACHING FESTIVITY DID NOT FAIL TO APPEAR ON THE HOUSETOPS OF THE HUMBLEST VILLAGE PEASANT GLADNESS REIGNED THROUGHOUT THE HOUSEHOLD AND ALL HEARTS SAVE TWO REJOICED WITH UNABATED ACTIVITY
ARRAYED IN AN IRISH POPLIN OF THE DARKEST VISIBLE SHADE OF GREEN WITHOUT EITHER TRAIN OR FLOWER OF DISTINCTION NOT EVEN A SPECK OF RIBBON OR BORDER OF LACE AND NO ORNAMENT ONLY THE VALUED NECKLET WHICH GRACED HER PEARLY THROAT
THE QUEEN GAVE A HOWL OF RAGE AND DISMAY AND BEFORE SHE RECOVERED HER PRESENCE OF MIND CURDIE HAVING BEGUN WITH THE GROUP NEAREST HIM HAD ELEVEN OF THE KNIGHTS ON THEIR LEGS AGAIN STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE CRIED AS EACH MAN ROSE
BUT JAMES THEY REGARDED WITH EXTREME CONTEMPT THEY WERE DISGUSTED BY HIS INSENSIBILITY BY THE COOL WAY IN WHICH HE TALKED TO EVERY BODY OF HIS RUIN AND BY THE CHILDISH PLEASURE WHICH HE TOOK IN THE POMP AND LUXURY OF VERSAILLES
CURDIE WITH THE POINT OF HIS HUNTING KNIFE KEEPING HER FROM CLASPING HER MIGHTY ARMS ABOUT HIM AS HE WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING ONCE MORE A GOOD STAMP AT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT BUT THE QUEEN WAS MORE WARY AS WELL AS MORE AGILE THAN HITHERTO
OR HER MADDENED DESIRE TO BECOME THE WIFE OF A POOR TUTOR HAD SHE ONLY TAKEN INTO HER CONFIDENCE HER WHOSE WISE COUNSEL AND MOTHERLY EXAMPLE WERE AT ALL TIMES A PROMPT STEP TO DECISION
IS TO WORK IN EPISODES OR ACCESSORY INCIDENTS ONE MUST MIND HOWEVER THAT THE EPISODES ARE APPROPRIATE LIKE THE FIT OF MADNESS IN ORESTES WHICH LED TO HIS ARREST AND THE PURIFYING WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT HIS SALVATION
DENOUEMENT YET THERE ARE MANY DRAMATISTS WHO AFTER A GOOD COMPLICATION FAIL IN THE DENOUEMENT BUT IT IS NECESSARY FOR BOTH POINTS OF CONSTRUCTION TO BE ALWAYS DULY MASTERED
HOWEVER NOT TO MISS ME AND LOSE THYSELF THE BEST PLAN WILL BE TO CUT SOME BRANCHES OF THE BROOM THAT IS SO ABUNDANT ABOUT HERE AND AS THOU GOEST TO LAY THEM AT INTERVALS UNTIL THOU HAST COME OUT UPON THE PLAIN
D TO THE THIRD C FOR ONE MAY THEN METAPHORICALLY PUT B IN LIEU OF D AND D IN LIEU OF B NOW AND THEN TOO THEY QUALIFY
AND SO IT SUFFICES ME TO THINK AND BELIEVE THAT THE GOOD ALDONZA LORENZO IS FAIR AND VIRTUOUS AND AS TO HER PEDIGREE IT IS VERY LITTLE MATTER FOR NO ONE WILL EXAMINE INTO IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONFERRING ANY ORDER UPON HER
INDIVISIBLE SOUNDS ARE UTTERED BY THE BRUTES ALSO BUT NO ONE OF THESE IS A LETTER IN OUR SENSE OF THE TERM THESE ELEMENTARY SOUNDS ARE EITHER VOWELS SEMIVOWELS OR MUTES
A CASE OF A NOUN OR VERB IS WHEN THE WORD MEANS OF OR TO A THING AND SO FORTH
THE HEALTH THAT HE HIMSELF ENJOYS NOT IF THY BEAUTY DESPISES ME IF THY WORTH IS NOT FOR ME IF THY SCORN IS MY AFFLICTION THOUGH I BE SUFFICIENTLY LONG SUFFERING HARDLY SHALL I ENDURE THIS ANXIETY WHICH
THE UNITY OF A PLOT DOES NOT CONSIST AS SOME SUPPOSE IN ITS HAVING ONE MAN AS ITS SUBJECT AN INFINITY OF THINGS BEFALL THAT ONE MAN SOME OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REDUCE TO UNITY
THOUGH AN ATTRACTION IS THE LEAST ARTISTIC OF ALL THE PARTS AND HAS LEAST TO DO WITH THE ART OF POETRY THE TRAGIC EFFECT IS QUITE POSSIBLE WITHOUT A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE AND ACTORS
A VOWEL IS A LETTER HAVING AN AUDIBLE SOUND WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER LETTER
AS THE MOST EXALTED PRINCESS ON EARTH IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT ALL THOSE POETS WHO SANG THE PRAISES OF LADIES UNDER THE FANCY NAMES THEY GIVE THEM HAD ANY SUCH MISTRESSES
BEAUTY IS A MATTER OF SIZE AND ORDER AND THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE EITHER ONE IN A VERY MINUTE CREATURE SINCE OUR PERCEPTION BECOMES INDISTINCT AS IT APPROACHES INSTANTANEITY OR TWO
A CERTAIN MAN HAS BEEN ABROAD MANY YEARS POSEIDON IS EVER ON THE WATCH FOR HIM AND HE IS ALL ALONE MATTERS AT HOME TOO HAVE COME TO THIS THAT HIS SUBSTANCE IS BEING WASTED
OBSERVE THE LANDMARKS WELL SAID DON QUIXOTE FOR I WILL TRY NOT TO GO FAR FROM THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AND I WILL EVEN TAKE CARE TO MOUNT THE HIGHEST OF THESE ROCKS TO SEE IF I CAN DISCOVER THEE RETURNING
WITHOUT MORE ADO HE CUT A COUPLE OF GAMBADOS IN THE AIR AND A COUPLE OF SOMERSAULTS HEELS OVER HEAD
POLYGNOTUS FOR WHEREAS THE LATTER IS STRONG IN CHARACTER THE WORK OF ZEUXIS IS DEVOID OF IT AND AGAIN ONE MAY STRING TOGETHER A SERIES OF CHARACTERISTIC SPEECHES OF THE UTMOST FINISH AS REGARDS DICTION AND THOUGHT
OF A SIGNIFICANT AND A NON SIGNIFICANT PART
I SAY THAT YOUR WORSHIP IS ENTIRELY RIGHT SAID SANCHO AND THAT I AM AN ASS BUT I KNOW NOT HOW THE NAME OF ASS CAME INTO MY MOUTH FOR A ROPE
CLEON WALKS CLEON IS AN INSTANCE OF SUCH A PART A SPEECH IS SAID TO BE ONE IN TWO WAYS EITHER AS SIGNIFYING ONE THING OR AS A UNION OF SEVERAL SPEECHES MADE INTO ONE BY CONJUNCTION
THE TRAGEDIES OF MOST OF THE MODERNS ARE CHARACTERLESS A DEFECT COMMON AMONG POETS OF ALL KINDS AND WITH ITS COUNTERPART IN PAINTING
AND HIS SON'S DEATH PLOTTED BY SUITORS TO HIS WIFE THEN HE ARRIVES THERE HIMSELF AFTER HIS GRIEVOUS SUFFERINGS REVEALS HIMSELF AND FALLS ON HIS ENEMIES AND THE END IS HIS SALVATION AND THEIR DEATH
IN A DRAMATIC NOT IN A NARRATIVE FORM WITH INCIDENTS AROUSING PITY AND FEAR WHEREWITH TO ACCOMPLISH ITS CATHARSIS OF SUCH EMOTIONS
AND NEED NOT BE COUNTED THERE IS NO NOUN HOWEVER ENDING IN A MUTE OR IN EITHER OF THE TWO SHORT VOWELS E AND O ONLY THREE
AND YET FAIL TO PRODUCE THE TRUE TRAGIC EFFECT BUT ONE WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER SUCCESS WITH A TRAGEDY WHICH HOWEVER INFERIOR IN THESE RESPECTS HAS A PLOT A COMBINATION OF INCIDENTS IN IT
THAT WE ARE HAPPY OR THE REVERSE IN A PLAY ACCORDINGLY THEY DO NOT ACT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY THE CHARACTERS THEY INCLUDE THE CHARACTERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION
AND THAT THE CHARACTERS COME SECOND COMPARE THE PARALLEL IN PAINTING WHERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLOURS LAID ON WITHOUT ORDER WILL NOT GIVE ONE THE SAME PLEASURE AS A SIMPLE BLACK AND WHITE SKETCH OF A PORTRAIT
SINCE IT IS FROM THESE THAT WE ASCRIBE CERTAIN QUALITIES TO THEIR ACTIONS THERE ARE IN THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS THEREFORE TWO CAUSES CHARACTER AND THOUGHT
IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT A SPEECH IS NOT ALWAYS MADE UP OF NOUN AND VERB IT MAY BE WITHOUT A VERB LIKE THE DEFINITION OF MAN BUT IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOME PART WITH A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE BY ITSELF IN THE SPEECH
THE FOURTH CONSTITUENT IS THAT OF SPECTACLE EXEMPLIFIED IN THE
YET IN THEIR PERIPETIES AS ALSO IN THEIR SIMPLE PLOTS THE POETS I MEAN SHOW WONDERFUL SKILL IN AIMING AT THE KIND OF EFFECT THEY DESIRE A TRAGIC SITUATION THAT AROUSES THE HUMAN FEELING IN ONE LIKE THE CLEVER VILLAIN
AND THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BESIDES THESE SIX OF THESE ITS FORMATIVE ELEMENTS
THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER FORM OF QUALIFIED METAPHOR HAVING GIVEN THE THING THE ALIEN NAME ONE MAY BY A NEGATIVE ADDITION DENY OF IT ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES NATURALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ITS NEW NAME
THOUGH NOT IN REFERENCE TO THE SAME PEOPLE SIGUNOS FOR INSTANCE IS AN ORDINARY WORD IN CYPRUS AND A STRANGE WORD WITH US
AND ONE DAY SAID TO THE WORTHY WIDOW BY WAY OF BROTHERLY REMONSTRANCE I AM SURPRISED SENORA AND NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON THAT A WOMAN OF SUCH HIGH STANDING SO FAIR AND SO RICH AS YOU ARE
ONE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER WHAT HAS BEEN SAID MORE THAN ONCE AND NOT WRITE A TRAGEDY ON AN EPIC BODY OF INCIDENT
CUT SOME HE ASKED HIS MASTER'S BLESSING AND NOT WITHOUT MANY TEARS ON BOTH SIDES TOOK HIS LEAVE OF HIM
END IN I AND FIVE IN T
AND I FOR MY PART RECKON HER THE MOST EXALTED PRINCESS IN THE WORLD FOR THOU SHOULDST KNOW SANCHO IF THOU DOST NOT KNOW THAT TWO THINGS ALONE BEYOND ALL OTHERS ARE INCENTIVES TO LOVE AND THESE ARE GREAT BEAUTY AND A GOOD NAME
NOT A FEW OF THE DRAMATISTS HAVE MADE DUE USE AS EVERY PLAY ONE MAY SAY ADMITS OF SPECTACLE CHARACTER FABLE DICTION MELODY AND THOUGHT
FOR THE OLDER POETS MAKE THEIR PERSONAGES DISCOURSE LIKE STATESMEN AND THE MODERNS LIKE RHETORICIANS
AGAIN TO BE BEAUTIFUL A LIVING CREATURE AND EVERY WHOLE MADE UP OF PARTS MUST NOT ONLY PRESENT A CERTAIN ORDER IN ITS ARRANGEMENT OF PARTS BUT ALSO BE OF A CERTAIN DEFINITE MAGNITUDE
C SO IS EVENING B TO DAY A ONE WILL ACCORDINGLY DESCRIBE EVENING B AS THE OLD AGE OF THE DAY D PLUS A OR BY THE
P S OR IN THE TWO COMPOUNDS OF THIS LAST P S AND X ARE MASCULINES ALL ENDING IN THE INVARIABLY LONG VOWELS
EITHER FAIL UTTERLY OR HAVE BUT ILL SUCCESS ON THE STAGE
I AM NOT SO MAD ANSWERED SANCHO BUT I AM MORE PEPPERY BUT APART FROM ALL THIS WHAT HAS YOUR WORSHIP TO EAT UNTIL I COME BACK WILL YOU SALLY OUT ON THE ROAD LIKE CARDENIO TO FORCE IT FROM THE SHEPHERDS
AT THE TIME WHEN HE IS CONSTRUCTING HIS PLOTS AND ENGAGED ON THE DICTION IN WHICH THEY ARE WORKED OUT THE POET SHOULD REMEMBER ONE TO PUT THE ACTUAL SCENES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BEFORE HIS EYES
LONG AFTER THAT THE BROTHER OF THE PRIESTESS HAPPENED TO COME THE FACT HOWEVER OF THE ORACLE HAVING FOR A CERTAIN REASON BIDDEN HIM GO THITHER AND HIS OBJECT IN GOING ARE OUTSIDE THE PLOT OF THE PLAY
OF THIS LAST KIND EIGHT A SPEECH IS A COMPOSITE SIGNIFICANT SOUND SOME OF THE PARTS OF WHICH HAVE A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE BY THEMSELVES
TO THIS EFFECT MISTRESS NIECE BY THIS FIRST OF ASS COLTS PLEASE PAY TO SANCHO PANZA MY SQUIRE THREE OF THE FIVE I LEFT AT HOME IN YOUR CHARGE SAID THREE ASS COLTS TO BE PAID AND DELIVERED FOR THE SAME
AN INSTANCE OF THIS WOULD BE TO CALL THE SHIELD
AND I PROMISE THEE THOU WILT NOT TELL OF AS MANY AS I MEAN TO PERFORM FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MASTER MINE SAID SANCHO
NOTHING OF THE KIND THEY ONLY INVENT THEM FOR THE MOST PART TO FURNISH A SUBJECT FOR THEIR VERSES AND THAT THEY MAY PASS FOR LOVERS OR FOR MEN VALIANT ENOUGH TO BE SO
LET NOT THAT ANXIETY TROUBLE THEE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE FOR EVEN IF I HAD IT I SHOULD NOT EAT ANYTHING BUT THE HERBS AND THE FRUITS WHICH THIS MEADOW AND THESE TREES MAY YIELD ME THE BEAUTY OF THIS BUSINESS OF MINE LIES IN NOT EATING
ALL THAT THEY WILL BE METAPHORICALLY DESCRIBED IN JUST THE SAME WAY THUS TO CAST FORTH SEED
THE LETTER OR ULTIMATE ELEMENT THE SYLLABLE THE CONJUNCTION THE ARTICLE THE NOUN THE VERB THE CASE AND THE SPEECH ONE
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO LENGTHEN IT OUT BY THE INSERTION OF EPISODES THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW HOW THE UNIVERSAL ELEMENT IN IPHIGENIA FOR INSTANCE MAY BE VIEWED A CERTAIN MAIDEN
AND FELT EASY AND SATISFIED IN HIS MIND THAT HE COULD SWEAR HE HAD LEFT HIS MASTER MAD AND SO WE WILL LEAVE HIM TO FOLLOW HIS ROAD UNTIL HIS RETURN
HAVING BEEN OFFERED IN SACRIFICE AND SPIRITED AWAY FROM HER SACRIFICERS INTO ANOTHER LAND WHERE THE CUSTOM WAS TO SACRIFICE ALL STRANGERS TO THE GODDESS SHE WAS MADE THERE THE PRIESTESS OF THIS RITE
IF IT BE THY PLEASURE TO GIVE ME RELIEF I AM THINE IF NOT DO AS MAY BE PLEASING TO THEE FOR BY ENDING MY LIFE I SHALL SATISFY THY CRUELTY AND MY DESIRE
CERTAIN ALSO OF THOSE WITHIN THE PLAY FORMING THE COMPLICATION AND THE REST THE DENOUEMENT BY COMPLICATION I MEAN ALL FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY TO THE POINT JUST BEFORE THE CHANGE IN THE HERO'S FORTUNES BY
H AND O AND IN A AMONG THE VOWELS THAT MAY BE LONG ARE FEMININES SO THAT THERE IS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MASCULINE AND FEMININE
AND WHEN HE HEARD THE MILLER'S BOAST HIS GREEDINESS WAS RAISED AND HE SENT FOR THE GIRL TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM THEN HE LED HER TO A CHAMBER IN HIS PALACE WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT HEAP OF STRAW AND GAVE HER A SPINNING WHEEL AND SAID
YOU PREFER A BLUESTOCKING IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL MISS ALDEN HER SISTER TELLS ME SAID PERCY BEAUMONT THAT SHE IS TREMENDOUSLY LITERARY I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
OF COURSE I NEEDN'T ASSURE YOU HE SAID THAT IF YOU SHOULD COME TO ENGLAND NEXT YEAR I EXPECT TO BE THE FIRST PERSON THAT YOU INFORM OF IT BESSIE ALDEN LOOKED AT HIM A LITTLE AND SHE SMILED
ROUND WENT THE WHEEL AGAIN TO THE OLD SONG AND THE MANIKIN ONCE MORE SPUN THE HEAP INTO GOLD THE KING CAME IN THE MORNING AND FINDING ALL HE WANTED WAS FORCED TO KEEP HIS WORD
THE CHAMBER DOOR WAS LOCKED AND SHE WAS LEFT ALONE SHE SAT DOWN IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO BEWAIL HER HARD FATE WHEN ON A SUDDEN THE DOOR OPENED AND A DROLL LOOKING LITTLE MAN HOBBLED IN AND SAID
I DID NOT BEFORE REMARK HOW VERY ILL YOU APPEAR SO THIN AND PALE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD BEEN WATCHING FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS YOU HAVE GUESSED RIGHT
THAT HE ONE DAY TOLD THE KING OF THE LAND WHO USED TO COME AND HUNT IN THE WOOD THAT HIS DAUGHTER COULD SPIN GOLD OUT OF STRAW NOW THIS KING WAS VERY FOND OF MONEY
THIS YOUNG LADY NO LONGER APPLIED TO PERCY BEAUMONT FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING HIS LORDSHIP SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF DIRECTLY TO THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN SHE ASKED HIM A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH BORED HIM A LITTLE
AND DISCOVERED TO MY SLEEPLESS AND ACHING EYES THE CHURCH OF INGOLSTADT ITS WHITE STEEPLE AND CLOCK WHICH INDICATED THE SIXTH HOUR THE PORTER OPENED THE GATES OF THE COURT WHICH HAD THAT NIGHT BEEN MY ASYLUM AND I ISSUED INTO THE STREETS
OF EVENINGS AT OPEN WINDOWS OR ON THE PERPETUAL VERANDAS IN THE SUMMER STARLIGHT ABOVE THE WARM ATLANTIC THE YOUNG ENGLISHMEN WERE INTRODUCED TO EVERYBODY
AND SINCE YOU APPEAR IN SUCH GOOD SPIRITS I MAY SPEAK TO YOU ON ONE SUBJECT MAY I NOT I TREMBLED ONE SUBJECT WHAT COULD IT BE
AND HE DISCOVERED FOR HIMSELF THAT THE YOUNG LADY WAS CLEVER AND APPEARED TO HAVE READ A GREAT DEAL SHE SEEMED VERY NICE THOUGH HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT AS MISSUS WESTGATE HAD SAID SHE WAS SHY
AND MY LOUD UNRESTRAINED HEARTLESS LAUGHTER FRIGHTENED AND ASTONISHED HIM MY DEAR VICTOR CRIED HE WHAT FOR GOD'S SAKE IS THE MATTER DO NOT LAUGH IN THAT MANNER HOW ILL YOU ARE
ALL THIS MUST BE SPUN INTO GOLD BEFORE MORNING AS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE IT WAS IN VAIN THAT THE POOR MAIDEN SAID THAT IT WAS ONLY A SILLY BOAST OF HER FATHER
AND HE ADDED THAT MISTER WESTGATE HAD SEEMED VERY UNEASY LEST HIS WIFE SHOULD MISS HER VISITOR HE HAD BEEN IN SUCH AN AWFUL HURRY TO SEND HIM BACK TO HER I'M AFRAID YOU'LL NEVER COME UP TO AN AMERICAN HUSBAND IF THAT'S WHAT THE WIVES EXPECT HE SAID TO LORD LAMBETH
I AFTERWARDS LEARNED THAT KNOWING MY FATHER'S ADVANCED AGE AND UNFITNESS FOR SO LONG A JOURNEY AND HOW WRETCHED MY SICKNESS WOULD MAKE ELIZABETH HE SPARED THEM THIS GRIEF BY CONCEALING THE EXTENT OF MY DISORDER
AND A CONVULSIVE MOTION AGITATED ITS LIMBS HOW CAN I DESCRIBE MY EMOTIONS AT THIS CATASTROPHE OR HOW DELINEATE THE WRETCH WHOM WITH SUCH INFINITE PAINS AND CARE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO FORM
I HAVE LATELY BEEN SO DEEPLY ENGAGED IN ONE OCCUPATION THAT I HAVE NOT ALLOWED MYSELF SUFFICIENT REST AS YOU SEE BUT I HOPE I SINCERELY HOPE THAT ALL THESE EMPLOYMENTS ARE NOW AT AN END
AT OTHERS I NEARLY SANK TO THE GROUND THROUGH LANGUOR AND EXTREME WEAKNESS MINGLED WITH THIS HORROR I FELT THE BITTERNESS OF DISAPPOINTMENT
AND AS SOON AS HER LITTLE FRIEND CAME SHE SAT DOWN UPON HER THRONE AND CALLED ALL HER COURT ROUND TO ENJOY THE FUN AND THE NURSE STOOD BY HER SIDE WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS AS IF IT WAS QUITE READY TO BE GIVEN UP
DAMN MY EYES EXCLAIMED LORD LAMBETH IF ONE IS TO BE A DOZEN TIMES A DAY AT THE HOUSE IT IS A GREAT DEAL MORE CONVENIENT TO SLEEP THERE I AM SICK OF TRAVELING UP AND DOWN THIS BEASTLY AVENUE
THAT'S A GREAT PITY SAID BEAUMONT YOU WOULD FIND IT ALL SET FORTH THERE SO MUCH BETTER THAN I CAN DO IT HE IS A PEER THEN OH YES HE IS A PEER AND HAS HE ANY OTHER TITLE THAN LORD LAMBETH
AND ARE HIS PARENTS LIVING OH YES IF HIS FATHER WERE NOT LIVING HE WOULD BE A DUKE
HE KNEW THAT I COULD NOT HAVE A MORE KIND AND ATTENTIVE NURSE THAN HIMSELF AND FIRM IN THE HOPE HE FELT OF MY RECOVERY HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT INSTEAD OF DOING HARM
IT STOPPED JUST WHERE I WAS STANDING AND ON THE DOOR BEING OPENED I PERCEIVED HENRY CLERVAL WHO ON SEEING ME INSTANTLY SPRUNG OUT MY DEAR FRANKENSTEIN EXCLAIMED HE HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INFUSING LIFE INTO AN INANIMATE BODY FOR THIS I HAD DEPRIVED MYSELF OF REST AND HEALTH I HAD DESIRED IT WITH AN ARDOUR THAT FAR EXCEEDED MODERATION
I SAW A LITTLE HUT AND BEFORE THE HUT BURNT A FIRE AND ROUND ABOUT THE FIRE A FUNNY LITTLE DWARF WAS DANCING UPON ONE LEG AND SINGING MERRILY THE FEAST I'LL MAKE TODAY I'LL BREW TOMORROW BAKE
AND ALL THOSE SCENES OF HOME SO DEAR TO MY RECOLLECTION I GRASPED HIS HAND AND IN A MOMENT FORGOT MY HORROR AND MISFORTUNE I FELT SUDDENLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING MANY MONTHS CALM AND SERENE JOY
AND HE MUTTERED SOME INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHILE A GRIN WRINKLED HIS CHEEKS HE MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN BUT I DID NOT HEAR ONE HAND WAS STRETCHED OUT SEEMINGLY TO DETAIN ME
MERRILY I'LL DANCE AND SING FOR NEXT DAY WILL A STRANGER BRING LITTLE DOES MY LADY DREAM RUMPELSTILTSKIN IS MY NAME WHEN THE QUEEN HEARD THIS SHE JUMPED FOR JOY
HEREUPON IT WAS THAT AS I HAVE SAID HE WAS A LITTLE BORED DO YOU WANT TO BUY UP THEIR LEASES HE ASKED WELL HAVE YOU GOT ANY LIVINGS SHE DEMANDED OH I SAY HE CRIED
HIS POSITION PERCY BEAUMONT REPEATED HIS RANK OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T GOT A PEERAGE LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THACKERAY
NO MADAM IS IT TOM NO MADAM IS IT JEMMY IT IS NOT CAN YOUR NAME BE
HIS HAIR WAS OF A LUSTROUS BLACK AND FLOWING HIS TEETH OF A PEARLY WHITENESS BUT THESE LUXURIANCES ONLY FORMED A MORE HORRID CONTRAST WITH HIS WATERY EYES
HE AT FIRST BELIEVED THEM TO BE THE WANDERINGS OF MY DISTURBED IMAGINATION BUT THE PERTINACITY WITH WHICH I CONTINUALLY RECURRED TO THE SAME SUBJECT PERSUADED HIM THAT MY DISORDER INDEED OWED ITS ORIGIN TO SOME UNCOMMON AND TERRIBLE
PACING THEM WITH QUICK STEPS AS IF I SOUGHT TO AVOID THE WRETCH WHOM I FEARED EVERY TURNING OF THE STREET WOULD PRESENT TO MY VIEW I DID NOT DARE RETURN TO THE APARTMENT WHICH I INHABITED BUT FELT IMPELLED TO HURRY ON
I FELT ALSO SENTIMENTS OF JOY AND AFFECTION REVIVE IN MY BOSOM MY GLOOM DISAPPEARED AND IN A SHORT TIME I BECAME AS CHEERFUL AS BEFORE I WAS ATTACKED BY THE FATAL PASSION
BUT TELL ME HOW YOU LEFT MY FATHER BROTHERS AND ELIZABETH VERY WELL AND VERY HAPPY ONLY A LITTLE UNEASY THAT THEY HEAR FROM YOU SO SELDOM BY THE BY I MEAN TO LECTURE YOU A LITTLE UPON THEIR ACCOUNT MYSELF
HOW FORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE AT THE VERY MOMENT OF MY ALIGHTING NOTHING COULD EQUAL MY DELIGHT ON SEEING CLERVAL HIS PRESENCE BROUGHT BACK TO MY THOUGHTS MY FATHER ELIZABETH
IT MEANS HE SAID THAT YOUR FATHER IS LAID UP I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S ANYTHING SERIOUS BUT YOU HAVE NO OPTION TAKE THE FIRST STEAMER BUT DON'T BE ALARMED
HE PERFORMED THE KINDEST ACTION THAT HE COULD TOWARDS THEM BUT I WAS IN REALITY VERY ILL AND SURELY NOTHING BUT THE UNBOUNDED AND UNREMITTING ATTENTIONS OF MY FRIEND COULD HAVE RESTORED ME TO LIFE
THEN THE LITTLE MAN BEGAN TO CHUCKLE AT THE THOUGHT OF HAVING THE POOR CHILD TO TAKE HOME WITH HIM TO HIS HUT IN THE WOODS AND HE CRIED OUT NOW LADY WHAT IS MY NAME IS IT JOHN ASKED SHE
IF SHE WAS SHY SHE CARRIED IT OFF VERY WELL MISTER BEAUMONT SHE HAD SAID PLEASE TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT LORD LAMBETH'S FAMILY HOW WOULD YOU SAY IT IN ENGLAND HIS POSITION
COULD HE ALLUDE TO AN OBJECT ON WHOM I DARED NOT EVEN THINK COMPOSE YOURSELF SAID CLERVAL WHO OBSERVED MY CHANGE OF COLOUR I WILL NOT MENTION IT IF IT AGITATES YOU
A STEP TO WHICH PERCY BEAUMONT AT FIRST OFFERED SOME CONSCIENTIOUS OPPOSITION I CALL HIS OPPOSITION CONSCIENTIOUS BECAUSE IT WAS FOUNDED UPON SOME TALK THAT HE HAD HAD ON THE SECOND DAY WITH BESSIE ALDEN
AND WE SOON ARRIVED AT MY COLLEGE I THEN REFLECTED AND THE THOUGHT MADE ME SHIVER THAT THE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LEFT IN MY APARTMENT MIGHT STILL BE THERE ALIVE AND WALKING ABOUT
SHE HAS BEEN ASKING ME SAID BEAUMONT ALL ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR POSSESSIONS I AM SURE IT IS VERY GOOD OF HER LORD LAMBETH REJOINED WELL THEN OBSERVED HIS COMPANION IF YOU GO YOU GO WITH YOUR EYES OPEN
I DREADED TO BEHOLD THIS MONSTER BUT I FEARED STILL MORE THAT HENRY SHOULD SEE HIM ENTREATING HIM THEREFORE TO REMAIN A FEW MINUTES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS I DARTED UP TOWARDS MY OWN ROOM
BUT I ESCAPED AND RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS I TOOK REFUGE IN THE COURTYARD BELONGING TO THE HOUSE WHICH I INHABITED WHERE I REMAINED DURING THE REST OF THE NIGHT WALKING UP AND DOWN IN THE GREATEST AGITATION
LORD LAMBETH MADE HIS FAREWELLS BUT THE FEW LAST WORDS THAT HE EXCHANGED WITH BESSIE ALDEN ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE A PLACE IN OUR RECORD
BUT I REMAINED SOME MINUTES WITH MY EYES FIXED ON A COACH THAT WAS COMING TOWARDS ME FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STREET AS IT DREW NEARER I OBSERVED THAT IT WAS THE SWISS DILIGENCE
THE FIRST LITTLE CHILD THAT YOU MAY HAVE WHEN YOU ARE QUEEN THAT MAY NEVER BE THOUGHT THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER AND AS SHE KNEW NO OTHER WAY TO GET HER TASK DONE SHE SAID SHE WOULD DO WHAT HE ASKED
THE FORM OF THE MONSTER ON WHOM I HAD BESTOWED EXISTENCE WAS FOREVER BEFORE MY EYES AND I RAVED INCESSANTLY CONCERNING HIM DOUBTLESS MY WORDS SURPRISED HENRY
IT WAS LORD LAMBETH'S THEORY FREELY PROPOUNDED WHEN THE YOUNG MEN WERE TOGETHER THAT PERCY BEAUMONT WAS HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME WITH MISSUS WESTGATE AND THAT UNDER THE PRETEXT OF MEETING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANIMATED DISCUSSION
I FELT MY FLESH TINGLE WITH EXCESS OF SENSITIVENESS AND MY PULSE BEAT RAPIDLY I WAS UNABLE TO REMAIN FOR A SINGLE INSTANT IN THE SAME PLACE I JUMPED OVER THE CHAIRS CLAPPED MY HANDS AND LAUGHED ALOUD
THE CLEAN MIND WHICH IS THERE BECAUSE OF ITS WEAK BODY IS SPEEDILY FOULED AND CONTAMINATED THE MORTALITY IS EXCESSIVE BUT EVEN THEN THEY DIE FAR TOO LINGERING DEATHS
FAILURE GENERALLY MEANS DEATH MEN WHO ARE FIRED WITH ZEAL FOR ALL NEW CAUSES ARE FOREVER RUNNING FOUL OF THE LAW SOCIAL ORGANIZATION LIKE BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION IS CONSERVATIVE ALL THINGS THAT LIVE
AND CUT EACH OTHER'S THROATS AND OURS IN THE BARGAIN IF WE DON'T BELONG TO A STRONG UNION WITHOUT GOING FURTHER INTO THE ARGUMENT THIS MAN ON THE MILE END WASTE POINTED THE MORAL THAT WHEN TWO MEN WERE AFTER THE ONE JOB WAGES WERE BOUND TO FALL
THE MEMBERS ARE ANXIOUS TO MAKE EVERYONE ELSE CONFORM TO THEIR IDEAS AND HABITS SUCH LAWS AS SUNDAY LAWS LIQUOR LAWS AND THE LIKE ARE EXAMPLES
RELIGIOUS COMMANDS AND FEELINGS ARE HIGHER AND MORE BINDING ON MAN THAN HUMAN LAW THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY ARE FOREVER BELITTLING AND CRITICISING ALL THOSE LAWS MADE BY LEGISLATURES AND COURTS
BUT ONLY SERVES TO MAKE MEN DOUBT THE EVIL OF VIOLATING ANY LAW IT IS NEVER EASY TO GET A LEGISLATURE TO REPEAL A LAW GENERALLY SOME ORGANIZATION OR COMMITTEE OF PEOPLE
IT IS EASY TO DISTINGUISH THIS SORT OF ACTION FROM THE THINGS DONE BY THOSE WHO ARE KNOWN AS CRIMINALS THEIR ACTS ARE DONE TO SERVE PERSONAL ENDS
IS INTERESTED IN KEEPING IT ALIVE AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FEAR LOSING THEIR VOTES SOCIAL IDEAS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING NO LAWS OR CUSTOMS ARE ETERNAL THE ORDINARY MAN AND ESPECIALLY THE MAN UNDER THE NORMAL
THIS IS DONE ON THE EXCUSE THAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES IT AND THE MAN WHO MAKES A STRICT RETURN ACCORDING TO LAW WOULD PAY THE TAXES OF THE SHIRKERS WHILE THIS IS TRUE IT SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ALL MEN VIOLATE THE LAW
THERE YOU ARE CAME THE ANSWER HOW ABOUT THE WIFE AND KIDDIES OF THE MAN WHO WORKS CHEAPER THAN YOU AND GETS YOUR JOB EH HOW ABOUT HIS WIFE AND KIDDIES HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN THEM THAN IN YOURS AND HE CAN'T SEE THEM STARVE SO HE CUTS THE PRICE OF LABOUR AND OUT YOU GO
FACTORY LEGISLATION OF ALL KINDS ANYTHING IN SHORT THAT INTERFERES WITH THE UNRESTRICTED USE OF PROPERTY BY ITS OWNER ARE ROUNDLY CONDEMNED AND VIOLATED BY EVASION ON THE OTHER HAND
THE EXTRACTS ARE QUOTED FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE TRADE UNION I WORKED AT SULLIVAN'S PLACE IN WIDNES BETTER KNOWN AS THE BRITISH ALKALI CHEMICAL WORKS I WAS WORKING IN A SHED AND I HAD TO CROSS THE YARD IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT ABOUT
AND HABIT IN MATTERS OF CONDUCT MOST PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT AT HOME AND IN SCHOOL THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARE RIGHT AND THAT OTHERS ARE WRONG THIS CONSTANT INSTRUCTION BUILDS UP HABITS AND RULES OF CONDUCT
IT CAN BE PRESERVED ONLY BY A TOLERANT PEOPLE AND THIS MEANS ETERNAL CONFLICT EMERSON SAID THAT THE GOOD CITIZEN MUST NOT BE OVER OBEDIENT TO LAW FREEDOM IS ALWAYS TRAMPLED ON
ARE FREELY VIOLATED MANY LAWS ARE SO RECENT THAT THEY HAVE NOT GROWN TO BE FOLK WAYS OR FIXED NEW HABITS AND THEIR VIOLATION BRINGS NO MORAL SHOCK IN SPITE OF THE PROFESSIONS OFTEN MADE
AND WHEN HEAVY WORK WAS TO BE DONE HE WAS THE MAN PICKED OUT TO DO IT AND THEN THE THING HAPPENED AND HE WENT INTO THE WORKHOUSE THE ALTERNATIVE TO THE WORKHOUSE IS TO GO HOME TO IRELAND AND BURDEN HIS FRIENDS FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
THE OTHER TWO NO MATTER HOW CAPABLE THEY MAY BE WILL NONE THE LESS BE INEFFICIENTS IF GERMANY JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CAPTURE THE ENTIRE WORLD MARKET FOR IRON COAL AND TEXTILES
FOR FAR LESS RETURN I HAVE DEPICTED THE NIGHTS THEY SPEND AND HOW DRIVEN IN BY PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION THEY GO TO THE CASUAL WARD FOR A REST UP NOR IS THE CASUAL WARD A SOFT SNAP
THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO WILL USE THE STRONGEST AND HIGHEST EMOTIONS OF MEN TO SERVE THEIR PRIVATE SORDID ENDS CHANGING SOCIAL SYSTEMS NEW POLITICAL IDEAS THE LABOR CAUSE
WHEN I WAS GETTING BETTER I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND ME A JOB HE TOLD ME NOT TO TROUBLE MYSELF AS THE FIRM WAS NOT COLD HEARTED I WOULD BE RIGHT ENOUGH IN ANY CASE MISTER MANTON STOPPED COMING TO SEE ME
WITHOUT A SENSE OF GUILT BUT THEY CANNOT SEE HOW A LAW THEY BELIEVE IN CAN BE VIOLATED WITHOUT SERIOUS OBLIQUITY APART FROM THIS THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CRIMES THAT WERE NOT OF THE CLASS THAT IMPLIED MORAL WRONG
FROM THE BEGINNING OF ORGANIZED GOVERNMENT DOWN TO THE BIRTH OF THE UNITED STATES AND EVEN TO THE PRESENT TIME FURNISHES AMPLE PROOF OF THIS AND STILL THE UNSUCCESSFUL REVOLUTIONIST MEETS WITH THE SEVEREST PENALTIES TO HIM
A CUTTING OUR THROATS RIGHT ALONG YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM WAS THE ANSWER THEY'RE JUST LIKE US AND THEY'VE GOT TO LIVE DON'T BLAME THE MAN WHO OFFERS TO WORK CHEAPER THAN YOU AND GETS YOUR JOB BUT OW ABOUT THE WIFE AN KIDDIES HIS INTERLOCUTOR DEMANDED
AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW A GOOD WORKER MAY SUDDENLY BECOME INEFFICIENT AND WHAT THEN HAPPENS TO HIM I AM TEMPTED TO GIVE THE CASE OF M'GARRY A MAN THIRTY TWO YEARS OF AGE AND AN INMATE OF THE WORKHOUSE
THAT THE LEAST EFFICIENT MUST DESCEND TO THE VERY BOTTOM WHICH IS THE SHAMBLES WHEREIN THEY PERISH MISERABLY A GLANCE AT THE CONFIRMED INEFFICIENTS AT THE BOTTOM
WHEN THE FACT THAT THE WELL TO DO DO NOT END THUS IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IT BECOMES MANIFEST THAT IT IS THE FATE OF AT LEAST ONE IN EVERY THREE ADULT WORKERS TO DIE ON PUBLIC CHARITY
WHILE CROSSING THE YARD I FELT SOMETHING TAKE HOLD OF MY LEG AND SCREW IT OFF I BECAME UNCONSCIOUS
I WAS LABOURING AT THE TIME I GOT MY LEGS OFF I GOT TWENTY FOUR SHILLINGS A WEEK RATHER BETTER PAY THAN THE OTHER MEN BECAUSE I USED TO TAKE SHIFTS WHEN THERE WAS HEAVY WORK TO BE DONE I USED TO BE PICKED OUT TO DO IT MISTER MANTON THE MANAGER VISITED ME AT THE HOSPITAL SEVERAL TIMES
WHICH KNOWS NO STOPPING PLACE SHORT OF THE BOTTOM AND DEATH IN THIS LAST INSTANCE THE STATISTICS OF LONDON TELL A TERRIBLE TALE THE POPULATION OF LONDON IS ONE SEVENTH OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
AND HAVE COVERED THE HOLE UP WITH A PIECE OF SHEET IRON THEY GAVE ME TWENTY FIVE POUNDS THEY DIDN'T RECKON THAT AS COMPENSATION THEY SAID IT WAS ONLY FOR CHARITY'S SAKE OUT OF THAT I PAID NINE POUNDS FOR A MACHINE BY WHICH TO WHEEL MYSELF ABOUT
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED WORKERS THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS IN THE UNITED STATES THE TRAMP IS ALMOST INVARIABLY A DISCOURAGED WORKER HE FINDS TRAMPING A SOFTER MODE OF LIFE THAN WORKING
FOR EXAMPLE THE REVENUE LAWS THESE ARE CLEAR AND EXPLICIT AND YET MEN TAKE EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE TO HAVE THEIR PROPERTY EXEMPTED FROM TAXATION IN OTHER WORDS TO DEFRAUD THE STATE
THEN TOO EVERY STATE OR NATION CARRIES A LARGE LIST OF LAWS THAT MEN HAVE SO LONG VIOLATED AND IGNORED THAT THEY VIRTUALLY ARE DEAD TO VIOLATE THESE BRINGS NO FEELING OF WRONG
CANNOT KEEP UP WITH ALL THE SHIFTING OF A CHANGING WORLD THERE IS ALWAYS A FRACTION OF A COMMUNITY AGITATING FOR SOMETHING NEW AND GRADUALLY FORCING THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT IT INTO LAW EVEN AGAINST THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY
MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE EAGER TO GET STATUTES ON THE BOOKS ONE SELDOM HEARS OF A SOCIETY OR CLUB THAT IS ACTIVE IN GETTING LAWS REPEALED THE CONSTANT CHANGE OF LAW
A FEELING THAT NOTHING CAN STAND AGAINST OPPOSITION IS DESTROYED BY FORCE AND OFTEN BLIND CRUEL UNREASONING FORCE SOMETIMES EVEN WORSE THIS FORCE IS CREATED FOR SELFISH ENDS
ALL MOVEMENTS FOR RELIGIOUS SOCIAL OR POLITICAL CHANGE HAVE THEIR ZEALOTS THEY ARE MET BY THE FORCE OF CONVENTION AND CONSERVATISM READY TO DEFEND ITSELF AND THE CLASH IS INEVITABLE
AND UPON WHOM THE WRECKING PROCESS IS JUST BEGINNING TO OPERATE ALL THE FORCES HERE IT MUST BE REMEMBERED ARE DESTRUCTIVE THE GOOD BODY WHICH IS THERE BECAUSE ITS BRAIN IS NOT QUICK AND CAPABLE IS SPEEDILY WRENCHED AND TWISTED OUT OF SHAPE
NO TWO ETHICAL COMMANDS HAVE THE SAME IMPORTANCE TO ALL PEOPLE OR TO ANY TWO PEOPLE OFTEN MEN DO NOT HESITATE TO CIRCUMVENT OR VIOLATE ONE STATUTE
STARVATION WAGES ARMIES OF UNEMPLOYED AND GREAT NUMBERS OF THE HOMELESS AND SHELTERLESS ARE INEVITABLE WHEN THERE ARE MORE MEN TO DO WORK THAN THERE IS WORK FOR MEN TO DO THE MEN AND WOMEN I HAVE MET UPON THE STREETS AND IN THE SPIKES AND PEGS
BEING CROWDED OUT BECAUSE OF INEFFICIENCY THEY CANNOT GO UP BUT MUST DESCEND AND CONTINUE TO DESCEND UNTIL THEY REACH THEIR PROPER LEVEL A PLACE IN THE INDUSTRIAL FABRIC WHERE THEY ARE EFFICIENT IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE AND IT IS INEXORABLE
THE ACTS OF THE REVOLUTIONIST WHO SAW OR THOUGHT HE SAW VISIONS OF SOMETHING BETTER THE MAN WHO IS INSPIRED BY THE LOVE OF HIS FELLOW MAN AND WHO HAS NO PERSONAL ENDS TO GAIN
AND IN LONDON YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT ONE ADULT IN EVERY FOUR DIES ON PUBLIC CHARITY EITHER IN THE WORKHOUSE THE HOSPITAL OR THE ASYLUM
EACH PERSON HAS HIS OWN IDEA OF THE RELATIVE VALUES ATTACHED TO HUMAN ACTIONS
ARE NOT THERE BECAUSE AS A MODE OF LIFE IT MAY BE CONSIDERED A SOFT SNAP I HAVE SUFFICIENTLY OUTLINED THE HARDSHIPS THEY UNDERGO TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR EXISTENCE IS ANYTHING BUT SOFT
BELIEVES IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF ALL LAWS OR THE DUTY TO OBEY ALL LAWS AND NO ONE IN FACT DOES OBEY THEM ALL THOSE WHO PROCLAIM THE LOUDEST THE DUTY OF OBEDIENCE TO ALL LAWS NEVER OBEY
THE ENGINEER WHO IS IRREGULAR OR IRRESPONSIBLE WILL SINK DOWN UNTIL HE FINDS HIS PLACE SAY AS A CASUAL LABOURER AN OCCUPATION IRREGULAR IN ITS VERY NATURE AND IN WHICH THERE IS LITTLE OR NO RESPONSIBILITY
IN TIMES OF STRESS THE UNITED STATES SUFFERED SERIOUS ENCROACHMENTS ON LIBERTY DURING THE CIVIL WAR DURING THE LAST WAR THESE ENCROACHMENTS WERE GREATER THAN ANY AMERICAN COULD HAVE POSSIBLY DREAMED
HE ONLY RECOGNIZES WHAT IS TRUE MEN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OBLIGED TO FIGHT TO PRESERVE LIBERTY CONSTITUTIONS AND LAWS DO NOT SAFEGUARD LIBERTY
THIS IS QUITE APART FROM THE TEACHING THAT IT IS THE DUTY OF ALL MEN TO OBEY ALL LAWS A PROPOSITION SO GENERAL THAT IT HAS NO EFFECT EVEN THOSE WHO MAKE THE STATEMENT DO NOT FOLLOW THE PRECEPT
THOSE WHO ARE SLOW AND CLUMSY WHO SUFFER FROM WEAKNESS OF BODY OR MIND OR WHO LACK NERVOUS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL STAMINA MUST SINK DOWN SOMETIMES RAPIDLY SOMETIMES STEP BY STEP TO THE BOTTOM
AND THERE YOU ARE AGAIN RIGHT ON THE HEAD THE UNION CHEEKS COMPETITION AMONG THE LABOURERS BUT MAKES IT HARDER WHERE THERE ARE NO UNIONS THERE'S WHERE YOUR CHEAP LABOUR OF WHITECHAPEL COMES IN THEY'RE UNSKILLED AND HAVE NO UNIONS
AT ONCE THE ENGLISH WORKERS WOULD BE THROWN IDLE BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS SOME WOULD EMIGRATE BUT THE REST WOULD RUSH THEIR LABOUR INTO THE REMAINING INDUSTRIES A GENERAL SHAKING UP OF THE WORKERS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WOULD RESULT AND WHEN EQUILIBRIUM HAD BEEN RESTORED
PROBABLY THE CHIEF BARRIER TO THE COMMISSION OF CRIME IS THE FEELING OF RIGHT AND WRONG CONNECTED WITH THE DOING OR NOT DOING OF PARTICULAR ACTS ALL MEN HAVE A MORE OR LESS BINDING CONSCIENCE THIS IS THE RESULT OF LONG TEACHING
TO SEND ME OFF A LOST SOUL A BEAST TO THE REST OF THEIR COMUS ROUT I LOOKED ROUND FOR SOME WEAPON NOTHING THEN WITH AN INSPIRATION I TURNED OVER THE DECK CHAIR PUT MY FOOT ON THE SIDE OF IT
JUST WHERE OTHER SPECIES BEGIN TO CROUCH AND DISAPPEAR AT ITS BEST IT IS USUALLY ABOUT NINETY FEET HIGH AND FIVE OR SIX FEET IN DIAMETER THOUGH YOU MAY FIND SPECIMENS HERE AND THERE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THIS
AFTER THE BLINDING SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SULPHUROUS GROUND
AND COULD ALWAYS TRUST MY DRIVER JERRY WAS QUICK AND PATIENT AT THE SAME TIME AND COULD TRUST HIS HORSE WHICH WAS A GREAT THING TOO HE VERY SELDOM USED THE WHIP I KNEW BY HIS VOICE AND HIS CLICK CLICK WHEN HE WANTED TO GET ON FAST
THESE CREATURES I HAD SEEN WERE THE VICTIMS OF SOME HIDEOUS EXPERIMENT THESE SICKENING SCOUNDRELS HAD MERELY INTENDED TO KEEP ME BACK TO FOOL ME WITH THEIR DISPLAY OF CONFIDENCE AND PRESENTLY TO FALL UPON ME WITH A FATE MORE HORRIBLE THAN DEATH
DECORATED WITH A FEW LEAFY SPRAYS REMINDING ONE OF THE CRUMBLING TOWERS OF OLD CASTLES SCANTILY DRAPED WITH IVY ITS HOMES ON BARE BARREN DOME AND RIDGE TOP SEEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR SAFETY AGAINST FIRE
AND THE ONLY SOUND NEAR ME WAS THE THIN HUM OF SOME SMALL GNATS THAT HAD DISCOVERED ME PRESENTLY I BECAME AWARE OF A DROWSY BREATHING SOUND
WITH TORTURE AND AFTER TORTURE
UNTIL I BEGAN TO THINK OF FOOD AND DRINK
CLINGING BY SLIGHT JOINTS TO THE ROCKS LIVING CHIEFLY ON SNOW AND THIN AIR AND MAINTAINING SOUND HEALTH ON THIS DIET FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE EVERY FEATURE OR EVERY GESTURE IT MAKES EXPRESSES STEADFAST DOGGED ENDURANCE
GROWING IN BEAUTIFUL ORDER ON MORAINES SCARCELY CHANGED AS YET BY POST GLACIAL WEATHERING COMPARED WITH THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER REGIONS THIS IS A SMALL TREE SELDOM EXCEEDING A HEIGHT OF EIGHTY OR NINETY FEET
OCCUPYING THE BALDEST DOMES AND PAVEMENTS IN THE UPPER SILVER FIR AND ALPINE ZONES
ALIVE OR DEAD AS IS DOES OVER A GLACIER BOULDER I HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF THESE WONDERFUL TREES BUT AS ALL OF THE VERY OLD ONES ARE HONEY COMBED WITH DRY ROT I NEVER WAS ABLE TO GET A COMPLETE COUNT OF THE LARGEST
WITHOUT ANY STRIKING EFFECT EXCEPT WHILE VERY YOUNG WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE OF A VIVID CRIMSON COLOR AND THE WHOLE TREE APPEARS TO BE DOTTED WITH BRILLIANT FLOWERS THE STAMINATE FLOWERS ARE STILL MORE SHOWY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR GREAT ABUNDANCE
ABOVE THE SILVER FIR ZONE FORMS THE BULK OF THE ALPINE FORESTS UP TO A HEIGHT OF FROM EIGHT THOUSAND
AND WILL GLADLY PAY YOU AN EXTRA FARE I'LL DO MY VERY BEST SAID JERRY HEARTILY IF YOU THINK YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH SIR FOR HE LOOKED DREADFULLY WHITE AND ILL I MUST GO HE SAID EARNESTLY
AND AS THEY LED HIM INTO A SHOP HE WALKED AS IF HE WERE IN GREAT PAIN JERRY OF COURSE CAME BACK TO THE STAND BUT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES ONE OF THE SHOPMEN CALLED HIM
I SAW THE LEVEL BLUE OF THE SEA THE PATH COILED DOWN ABRUPTLY INTO A NARROW RAVINE BETWEEN TWO TUMBLED AND KNOTTY MASSES OF BLACKISH SCORIAE INTO THIS WE PLUNGED IT WAS EXTREMELY DARK THIS PASSAGE
JERRY BARKER I NEVER KNEW A BETTER MAN THAN MY NEW MASTER HE WAS KIND AND GOOD AND AS STRONG FOR THE RIGHT AS JOHN MANLY AND SO GOOD TEMPERED AND MERRY THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD PICK A QUARREL WITH HIM
HE MADE A SWIFT MOVEMENT AND VANISHED THE FERN FRONDS HE HAD STOOD BETWEEN CAME SWISHING TOGETHER I PUSHED OUT OF THE BRAKE AFTER HIM AND WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HIM SWINGING CHEERFULLY BY ONE LANK ARM
WHERE CAN I GET SOMETHING TO EAT EAT HE SAID EAT MAN'S FOOD NOW
MY APE LIKE COMPANION TROTTED ALONG BY MY SIDE WITH HIS HANDS HANGING DOWN AND HIS JAW THRUST FORWARD
I HAD HALF A MIND TO DROWN MYSELF THEN BUT AN ODD WISH TO SEE THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OUT A QUEER IMPERSONAL SPECTACULAR INTEREST IN MYSELF RESTRAINED ME
AND AS READY AS A HOSPITAL RABBIT FOR MY FATE HE EMERGED BEHIND THE CORNER FOR I HEARD HIM SHOUT PRENDICK THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN AFTER ME SHOUTING THINGS AS HE RAN THIS TIME RUNNING BLINDLY
WITH SCARCE A TRACE OF THE ROCKY ANGULARITY AND BROKEN LIMBS SO CHARACTERISTIC A FEATURE THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF ITS RANGE IT NEVER MAKES ANYTHING LIKE A FOREST SELDOM EVEN A GROVE USUALLY IT STANDS OUT SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT
THE MOUNTAIN PINE PINUS MONTICOLA IS THE NOBLEST TREE OF THE ALPINE ZONE HARDY AND LONG LIVED TOWERING GRANDLY ABOVE ITS COMPANIONS AND BECOMING STRONGER AND MORE IMPOSING
WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW WE CAN GET OVER THE GROUND IF WE ONLY KNOW WHY IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO DRIVE FAST IN THE CITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN THE STREETS ARE FULL OF TRAFFIC BUT WE DID WHAT COULD BE DONE AND WHEN A GOOD DRIVER
THE THIN BARK IS STREAKED AND SPRINKLED WITH RESIN AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SHOWERED UPON THE FOREST LIKE RAIN THEREFORE THIS TREE MORE THAN ANY OTHER IS SUBJECT TO DESTRUCTION BY FIRE DURING STRONG WINDS EXTENSIVE FORESTS ARE DESTROYED
SO GLAD WE HIT THE TIME SIR BUT DON'T STAY NOW SIR THE BELL IS RINGING HERE PORTER TAKE THIS GENTLEMAN'S LUGGAGE DOVER LINE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN THAT'S IT AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANOTHER WORD
FROM A ROPE OF CREEPERS THAT LOOPED DOWN FROM THE FOLIAGE OVERHEAD HIS BACK WAS TO ME HULLO SAID I HE CAME DOWN WITH A TWISTING JUMP AND STOOD FACING ME I SAY SAID I
BLOTCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON DRIFTED ACROSS MY EYES MY CONDUCTOR STOPPED SUDDENLY HOME SAID HE AND I STOOD IN A FLOOR OF A CHASM THAT WAS AT FIRST ABSOLUTELY DARK TO ME
INCREASING IN VELOCITY AND DRAGGING THE FLAMES UPWARD THEN THE LEAVES CATCH FORMING AN IMMENSE COLUMN OF FIRE BEAUTIFULLY SPIRED ON THE EDGES AND TINTED A ROSE PURPLE HUE IT RUSHES ALOFT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE TREE
OFTEN GIVING A REDDISH YELLOW TINGE TO THE WHOLE MASS OF FOLIAGE AND FILLING THE AIR WITH POLLEN NO OTHER PINE ON THE RANGE IS SO REGULARLY PLANTED AS THIS ONE COVERING MORAINES THAT EXTEND ALONG THE SIDES OF THE HIGH ROCKY VALLEYS FOR MILES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
I KNEW NO WAY OF GETTING ANYTHING TO EAT I WAS TOO IGNORANT OF BOTANY TO DISCOVER ANY RESORT OF ROOT OR FRUIT THAT MIGHT LIE ABOUT ME I HAD NO MEANS OF TRAPPING THE FEW RABBITS UPON THE ISLAND
ON TREES THAT OCCUPY EXPOSED SITUATIONS NEAR ITS UPPER LIMIT THE BARK IS DEEP REDDISH BROWN AND RATHER DEEPLY FURROWED THE MAIN FURROWS RUNNING NEARLY PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND CONNECTED ON THE OLD TREES BY CONSPICUOUS CROSS FURROWS
AND A GOOD HORSE WHO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER ARE OF ONE MIND IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT THEY CAN DO I HAD A VERY GOOD MOUTH THAT IS I COULD BE GUIDED BY THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF THE REIN AND THAT IS A GREAT THING IN LONDON
AFTERWARDS I WAS TO FIND THAT A GREAT PROPORTION OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE HAD MALFORMED HANDS LACKING SOMETIMES EVEN THREE DIGITS BUT GUESSING THIS WAS IN SOME WAY A GREETING I DID THE SAME THING BY WAY OF REPLY HE GRINNED WITH IMMENSE SATISFACTION
WITH THE BRANCHES ON BUT PEELED AND RIGID APPEARING GRAY IN THE DISTANCE LIKE MISTY CLOUDS LATER THE BRANCHES DROP OFF LEAVING A FOREST OF BLEACHED SPARS
AND SO TO A BARE PLACE COVERED WITH A YELLOW WHITE INCRUSTATION
PLEASE TO OPEN THE DOOR AND LET US LOSE NO TIME THE NEXT MINUTE JERRY WAS ON THE BOX WITH A CHEERY CHIRRUP TO ME AND A TWITCH OF THE REIN THAT I WELL UNDERSTOOD NOW THEN JACK MY BOY SAID HE SPIN ALONG
IN TURN I RECALLED EACH ONE I HAD SEEN AND TRIED TO DRAW SOME AUGURY OF ASSISTANCE FROM MY MEMORY THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A STAGHOUND BAY AND AT THAT REALISED A NEW DANGER I TOOK LITTLE TIME TO THINK
HE COULD NOT BEAR ANY CARELESS LOITERING AND WASTE OF TIME AND NOTHING WAS SO NEAR MAKING HIM ANGRY AS TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WERE ALWAYS LATE WANTING A CAB HORSE TO BE DRIVEN HARD TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR IDLENESS
AND MANAGE TO GET TO THE FRONT GOING SO NEAR THE WHEELS ON EACH SIDE THAT HALF AN INCH NEARER AND THEY WOULD SCRAPE WELL YOU GET ALONG FOR A BIT BUT SOON FIND YOURSELF IN A LONG TRAIN OF CARTS AND CARRIAGES ALL OBLIGED TO GO AT A WALK
AND FOUND MONTGOMERY WITHIN A YARD OF IT HE MEANT TO LOCK THE OUTER DOOR I RAISED THIS NAILED STICK OF MINE AND CUT AT HIS FACE BUT HE SPRANG BACK I HESITATED A MOMENT THEN TURNED AND FLED ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
I STRETCHED MY LIMBS SORE AND PAINFUL FROM THE PRICKS OF THE SPINY PLANTS AND STARED AROUND ME AT THE TREES
AND SAVE FOR A FEEBLE BAR OF DEAL SPIKED WITH A SMALL NAIL THE MEREST MOCKERY OF A MACE I WAS UNARMED
COME ALONG SAID HE I WENT WITH HIM TO SEE THE ADVENTURE OUT I GUESSED THE HUTS WERE SOME ROUGH SHELTER WHERE HE AND SOME MORE OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE LIVED I MIGHT PERHAPS FIND THEM FRIENDLY
I HEARD SOME STRANGE NOISES AND THRUST THE KNUCKLES OF MY LEFT HAND INTO MY EYES I BECAME AWARE OF A DISAGREEABLE ODOR LIKE THAT OF A MONKEY'S CAGE ILL CLEANED BEYOND THE ROCK OPENED AGAIN UPON A GRADUAL SLOPE OF SUNLIT GREENERY
THE CONES ARE FROM FOUR TO EIGHT INCHES LONG SMOOTH SLENDER CYLINDRICAL AND SOMEWHAT CURVED THEY GROW IN CLUSTERS OF FROM THREE TO SIX OR SEVEN AND BECOME PENDULOUS AS THEY INCREASE IN WEIGHT
IF YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH LONDON FAST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IT WANTS A DEAL OF PRACTICE JERRY AND I WERE USED TO IT AND NO ONE COULD BEAT US AT GETTING THROUGH WHEN WE WERE SET UPON IT I WAS QUICK AND BOLD
THE BARK IS OF A BRIGHT CINNAMON COLOR AND IS HANDSOMELY BRAIDED AND RETICULATED ON THRIFTY TREES FLAKING OFF IN THIN SHINING RIBBONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES USED BY THE INDIANS FOR TENT MATTING
THE YOUNG MAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT AND SAID ANXIOUSLY I THINK I HAD BETTER GET OUT AND WALK I SHALL NEVER GET THERE IF THIS GOES ON I'LL DO ALL THAT CAN BE DONE SIR SAID JERRY I THINK WE SHALL BE IN TIME
THIS SPECIES IS NEARLY RELATED TO THE SUGAR PINE AND THOUGH NOT HALF SO TALL IT SUGGESTS ITS NOBLE RELATIVE IN THE WAY THAT IT EXTENDS ITS LONG BRANCHES IN GENERAL HABIT IT IS FIRST MET ON THE UPPER MARGIN OF THE SILVER FIR ZONE
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ON THIS ISLAND SAID I HOW LONG HE ASKED AND AFTER HAVING THE QUESTION REPEATED HE HELD UP THREE FINGERS THE CREATURE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN AN IDIOT
PERHAPS YOU COME TO A REGULAR BLOCK UP AND HAVE TO STAND STILL FOR MINUTES TOGETHER TILL SOMETHING CLEARS OUT INTO A SIDE STREET OR THE POLICEMAN INTERFERES YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR ANY CHANCE TO DASH FORWARD IF THERE BE AN OPENING
ARRIVING AT THE FOOT OF A TREE
IT IS AS MASSIVE AND SUGGESTIVE OF ENDURING STRENGTH AS AN OAK ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE TRUNK IS COMMONLY FREE OF LIMBS BUT CLOSE FRINGY TUFTS OF SPRAY OCCUR NEARLY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND
BUT SNATCHING UP MY NAILED STICK RUSHED HEADLONG FROM MY HIDING PLACE TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE SEA I REMEMBER A GROWTH OF THORNY PLANTS WITH SPINES THAT STABBED LIKE PEN KNIVES I EMERGED BLEEDING AND WITH TORN CLOTHES UPON THE LIP OF A LONG CREEK OPENING NORTHWARD
WADING UP THE CREEK AND PRESENTLY FINDING MYSELF KNEEDEEP IN A LITTLE STREAM I SCRAMBLED OUT AT LAST ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND WITH MY HEART BEATING LOUDLY IN MY EARS CREPT INTO A TANGLE OF FERNS TO AWAIT THE ISSUE I HEARD THE DOG
AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR I HEARD MONTGOMERY SHOUTING MY NAME FAR AWAY TO THE NORTH THAT SET ME THINKING OF MY PLAN OF ACTION AS I INTERPRETED IT THEN
THE DOORKEEPER LOOKED WITH A COMICAL TWIST OF THE FACE AT THE EMINENT EGOTIST AND SAID GO AWAY FOR WE SETTLE HERE
ANNE BEAT HIM BY FIVE BUT HER TRIUMPH WAS MARRED BY THE FACT THAT GILBERT CONGRATULATED HER HEARTILY BEFORE THE WHOLE SCHOOL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO MUCH SWEETER TO HER IF HE HAD FELT THE STING OF HIS DEFEAT
WISE PIOUS HUMBLE AND ALL THAT WHO SHOWED US LIFE AS ALL SHOULD LIVE IT LET THAT BE SAID AND GOD FORGIVE IT
AND THEN IN AN UNTHINKING MOMENT I IDLY TURNED THE LEAVES AND BEGAN TO INDOLENTLY STUDY DISEASES GENERALLY I FORGET WHICH WAS THE FIRST DISTEMPER I PLUNGED INTO SOME FEARFUL DEVASTATING SCOURGE I KNOW
WOMEN IN LOVE ARE LESS ASHAMED THAN MEN THEY HAVE LESS TO BE ASHAMED OF WHILE YOUR FRIEND HOLDS YOU AFFECTIONATELY BY BOTH YOUR HANDS YOU ARE SAFE FOR YOU CAN WATCH BOTH HIS EPITAPH
THE EXCEPTION PROVES THE RULE IS AN EXPRESSION CONSTANTLY UPON THE LIPS OF THE IGNORANT WHO PARROT IT FROM ONE ANOTHER WITH NEVER A THOUGHT OF ITS ABSURDITY IN THE LATIN EXCEPTIO PROBAT REGULAM
TIGHTENED THE RIVETS AND INSCRIBED HIS OWN
I HAVE SINCE BEEN INDUCED TO COME TO THE OPINION THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME AND MUST HAVE BEEN BEATING
PLEASE SEE THAT IT IS BURIED WITH ME FOR I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL LIVE VERY LONG PERHAPS WHEN SHE SEES ME LYING COLD AND DEAD BEFORE HER MISSUS BARRY MAY FEEL REMORSE FOR WHAT SHE HAS DONE AND WILL LET DIANA COME TO MY FUNERAL
AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THEE DIANA SAID ANNE SOLEMNLY EXTENDING HER HAND IN THE YEARS TO COME THY MEMORY WILL SHINE LIKE A STAR OVER MY LONELY LIFE
UNTIL HAVING PERHAPS BEEN ENFORCED FOR MANY YEARS SOMEBODY OBJECTS TO ITS OPERATION AGAINST HIMSELF I MEAN HIS CLIENT THE PRESIDENT IF HE APPROVES IT BEGINS TO EXECUTE IT AT ONCE
I FELT RATHER HURT ABOUT THIS AT FIRST
THEY GAVE ME CLUMPS ON THE SIDE OF THE
AN APPROVED REMEDY FOR THE DISEASE OF GARRULITY IT IS ALSO MUCH USED IN CASES OF EXTREME POVERTY ELECTOR
EXCOMMUNICATION
SILLY OLD QUILLY OLD MONARCH OF THOUGHT PUBLIC OPINION'S CAMP FOLLOWER HE THUNDERING BLUNDERING PLUNDERING FREE AFFECTED UNGRACIOUS SUSPECTED MENDACIOUS RESPECTED CONTEMPORAREE
ESOTERIC A D J VERY PARTICULARLY ABSTRUSE AND CONSUMMATELY OCCULT THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHIES WERE OF TWO KINDS EXOTERIC THOSE THAT THE PHILOSOPHERS THEMSELVES COULD PARTLY UNDERSTAND
STUDENTS WOULD HAVE NO NEED TO WALK THE HOSPITALS IF THEY HAD ME I WAS A HOSPITAL IN MYSELF
ASTONISHMENT AND HOPE STRUGGLING IN HER EXPRESSIVE EYES BUT THE HOPE FADED WHEN SHE SAW DIANA'S DEJECTED COUNTENANCE YOUR MOTHER HASN'T RELENTED SHE GASPED DIANA SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY NO AND OH ANNE
DESCRIBED IN THE CHARGE SHEET AS A MEDICAL STUDENT SO THAT HE NATURALLY HAS A SOMEWHAT FAMILY PHYSICIANARY WAY OF PUTTING THINGS I AGREED WITH GEORGE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SEEK OUT SOME RETIRED AND OLD WORLD SPOT
AND AT INTERVALS FROM BEHIND THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE IS HEARD THE VOICE OF THE FOREMAN DEMANDING THREE INCHES OF WIT
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SEEMED TO START OFF I PULLED OUT MY WATCH AND TIMED IT I MADE IT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN TO THE MINUTE I TRIED TO FEEL MY HEART I COULD NOT FEEL MY HEART IT HAD STOPPED BEATING
AND THAT THE ACUTE STAGE WOULD COMMENCE IN ABOUT ANOTHER FORTNIGHT BRIGHT'S DISEASE I WAS RELIEVED TO FIND I HAD ONLY IN A MODIFIED FORM AND SO FAR AS THAT WAS CONCERNED I MIGHT LIVE FOR YEARS
HE SAID HE DIDN'T KEEP IT I SAID YOU ARE A CHEMIST
LUNARIAN THEN WHEN YOUR CONGRESS HAS PASSED A LAW IT GOES DIRECTLY TO THE SUPREME COURT IN ORDER THAT IT MAY AT ONCE BE KNOWN WHETHER IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL TERRESTRIAN O NO IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF THE SUPREME COURT
THEN HE OPENED ME AND LOOKED DOWN ME AND CLUTCHED HOLD OF MY WRIST AND THEN HE HIT ME OVER THE CHEST WHEN I WASN'T EXPECTING IT A COWARDLY THING TO DO I CALL IT AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS BUTTED ME WITH THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AFTER THAT
I SHALL KEEP YOUR LOVELY PRESENT FOREVER MINNIE ANDREWS IS A VERY NICE LITTLE GIRL ALTHOUGH SHE HAS NO IMAGINATION BUT AFTER HAVING BEEN DIANA'S BUSUM FRIEND I CANNOT BE MINNIE'S
A PERSON OF LOW TASTE
TO SERVE ONESELF IS ECONOMY OF ADMINISTRATION IN EACH HUMAN HEART ARE A TIGER A PIG AN ASS AND A NIGHTINGALE DIVERSITY OF CHARACTER IS DUE TO THEIR UNEQUAL ACTIVITY
THE SICK MAN SAID IN FAINT AND FAILING TONES A MOMENT LATER HE WAS DEAD AND TAMBOURINE WAS BONES
AND A SMALL PARCEL WERE PASSED ACROSS TO ANNE DEAR ANNE RAN THE FORMER MOTHER SAYS I'M NOT TO PLAY WITH YOU OR TALK TO YOU EVEN IN SCHOOL IT ISN'T MY FAULT AND DON'T BE CROSS AT ME BECAUSE I LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS EVER
THIS ILLUSTRIOUS SAVANT AFTER HAVING MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES AROUND THE WORLD
THE MEMORY OF DOCTOR FRANKLIN IS JUSTLY HELD IN GREAT REVERENCE PARTICULARLY IN FRANCE WHERE A WAXEN EFFIGY OF HIM WAS RECENTLY ON EXHIBITION BEARING THE FOLLOWING TOUCHING ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE AND SERVICES TO SCIENCE
A THING WHICH TAKES THE LIBERTY TO DIFFER FROM OTHER THINGS OF ITS CLASS
BUT THIS SYSTEM OF MAINTAINING AN EXPENSIVE JUDICIAL MACHINERY TO PASS UPON THE VALIDITY OF LAWS ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE LONG BEEN EXECUTED
TO DECLARE THE RABBIT THE CAUSE OF A DOG EGOTIST
USEFUL PRESCRIPTIONS CURE FOR LIVER COMPLAINT IN CHILDREN
KISSED THE BOOKMARK AND DISPATCHED A PROMPT REPLY BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCHOOL MY OWN DARLING DIANA OF COURSE I AM NOT CROSS AT YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO OBEY YOUR MOTHER OUR SPIRITS CAN COMMUNE
BUMBLESHOOK EDUCATION
THE ART OF ORALLY PERSUADING FOOLS
FROM THE OFFICER OF LOWER RANK TO WHOM HIS DEATH WOULD GIVE PROMOTION EPICURE
THEY ARE AWFULLY FASHIONABLE NOW AND ONLY THREE GIRLS IN SCHOOL KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT REMEMBER YOUR TRUE FRIEND DIANA BARRY ANNE READ THE NOTE
THE WISDOM THAT ENABLES US TO RECOGNIZE AS AN UNDESIRABLE OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE FOLLY THAT WE HAVE ALREADY EMBRACED
EXPOSTULATION
SHE WOULD NOT STOOP TO ADMIT THAT SHE MEANT TO RIVAL GILBERT IN SCHOOLWORK BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS EXISTENCE WHICH ANNE PERSISTENTLY IGNORED BUT THE RIVALRY WAS THERE AND HONORS FLUCTUATED BETWEEN THEM
A PARTIAL DEFINITION OF THE WORD EVERLASTING
AND ESOTERIC THOSE THAT NOBODY COULD UNDERSTAND IT IS THE LATTER THAT HAVE MOST PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED MODERN THOUGHT AND FOUND GREATEST ACCEPTANCE IN OUR TIME ETHNOLOGY
BY EMBALMING THEIR DEAD AND THEREBY DERANGING THE NATURAL BALANCE BETWEEN ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE THE EGYPTIANS MADE THEIR ONCE FERTILE AND POPULOUS COUNTRY BARREN AND INCAPABLE OF SUPPORTING MORE THAN A MEAGRE CREW THE MODERN METALLIC
THE POSITION FARTHEST REMOVED ON EITHER HAND FROM THE INTERLOCUTOR THE MAN WAS PERISHING APACE WHO PLAYED THE TAMBOURINE THE SEAL OF DEATH WAS ON HIS FACE TWAS PALLID FOR TWAS CLEAN THIS IS THE END
WE WERE SITTING IN MY ROOM SMOKING AND TALKING ABOUT HOW BAD WE WERE BAD FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW I MEAN OF COURSE WE WERE ALL FEELING SEEDY AND WE WERE GETTING QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT IT HARRIS SAID HE FELT SUCH EXTRAORDINARY FITS OF
A TRANSIENT HORRIBLE FANTASTIC DREAM WHEREIN IS NOTHING YET ALL THINGS DO SEEM FROM WHICH WE'RE WAKENED BY A FRIENDLY NUDGE OF OUR BEDFELLOW DEATH AND CRY O FUDGE
OF WHOM NOT A SINGLE FRAGMENT WAS EVER RECOVERED ELECTRICITY SEEMS DESTINED TO PLAY A MOST IMPORTANT PART IN THE ARTS AND INDUSTRIES THE QUESTION OF ITS ECONOMICAL APPLICATION TO SOME PURPOSES IS STILL UNSETTLED
WE SMILED SADLY AT ONE ANOTHER AND SAID WE SUPPOSED WE HAD BETTER TRY TO SWALLOW A BIT HARRIS SAID A LITTLE SOMETHING IN ONE'S STOMACH OFTEN KEPT THE DISEASE IN CHECK AND MISSUS POPPETS BROUGHT THE TRAY IN
ONE WHO SERVES HIS COUNTRY BY RESIDING ABROAD YET IS NOT AN AMBASSADOR
BUT AS THE CAESAR'S PAGEANT SHORN OF BRUTUS BUST DID BUT OF ROME'S BEST SON REMIND HER MORE SO THE MARKED ABSENCE OF ANY TRIBUTE OR RECOGNITION FROM DIANA BARRY WHO WAS SITTING WITH GERTIE PYE EMBITTERED
ONE TEN MILE WALK EVERY MORNING ONE BED AT ELEVEN SHARP EVERY NIGHT AND DON'T STUFF UP YOUR HEAD WITH THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
ANNE STOOD AND WATCHED DIANA OUT OF SIGHT
ANNE'S LITTLE TRIUMPH DIANA MIGHT JUST HAVE SMILED AT ME ONCE I THINK SHE MOURNED TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT BUT THE NEXT MORNING A NOTE MOST FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY TWISTED AND FOLDED
BITTER TEARS IF I DID ANNE WAS WELCOMED BACK TO SCHOOL WITH OPEN ARMS HER IMAGINATION HAD BEEN SORELY MISSED IN GAMES HER VOICE IN THE SINGING AND HER DRAMATIC ABILITY IN THE PERUSAL ALOUD OF BOOKS AT DINNER HOUR
ALL THERE IS IN THE WORLD IF YOU LIKE IT ENOUGH IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST FOR THAT MATTER ENOUGHER'S AS GOOD AS A FEAST FOR THE PLATTER
AN INSCRIPTION ON A TOMB SHOWING THAT VIRTUES ACQUIRED BY DEATH HAVE A RETROACTIVE EFFECT FOLLOWING IS A TOUCHING EXAMPLE
THE OVERSTRAIN UPON OUR BRAINS HAS PRODUCED A GENERAL DEPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM CHANGE OF SCENE AND ABSENCE OF THE NECESSITY FOR THOUGHT WILL RESTORE THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM
AND ROAST IT TO A NUT BROWN DISCOMFORT EXILE
HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO CUT IT WITH QUERIED DIANA WIPING AWAY THE TEARS WHICH ANNE'S AFFECTING ACCENTS HAD CAUSED TO FLOW AFRESH AND RETURNING TO PRACTICALITIES YES I'VE GOT MY PATCHWORK SCISSORS IN MY APRON POCKET FORTUNATELY
OH DIANA WILL YOU PROMISE FAITHFULLY NEVER TO FORGET ME THE FRIEND OF YOUR YOUTH NO MATTER WHAT DEARER FRIENDS MAY CARESS THEE INDEED I WILL SOBBED DIANA AND I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER BOSOM FRIEND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
MEANS THAT THE EXCEPTION TESTS THE RULE PUTS IT TO THE PROOF NOT CONFIRMS IT THE MALEFACTOR WHO DREW THE MEANING FROM THIS EXCELLENT DICTUM AND SUBSTITUTED A CONTRARY ONE OF HIS OWN
OR BIDDING HIM TURN OFF THE WISDOM AND WHACK UP SOME PATHOS
THOSE SIMPLE OLD FASHIONED REMEDIES ARE SOMETIMES MORE EFFICACIOUS THAN ALL THE DISPENSARY STUFF WE SAT THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR DESCRIBING TO EACH OTHER OUR MALADIES I EXPLAINED TO GEORGE AND WILLIAM HARRIS HOW I FELT WHEN I GOT UP IN THE MORNING
I COULDN'T LOVE ANYBODY AS I LOVE YOU OH DIANA CRIED ANNE CLASPING HER HANDS DO YOU LOVE ME WHY OF COURSE I DO DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT NO ANNE DREW A LONG BREATH
SHE HAD BEEN TOLD BY MISTER PHILLIPS TO SIT WITH THE MODEL MINNIE ANDREWS SHE FOUND ON HER DESK A BIG LUSCIOUS STRAWBERRY APPLE ANNE CAUGHT IT UP ALL READY TO TAKE A BITE WHEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE ONLY PLACE IN AVONLEA WHERE STRAWBERRY APPLES GREW
IT WAS ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED ON GILBERT'S SIDE BUT IT IS MUCH TO BE FEARED THAT THE SAME THING CANNOT BE SAID OF ANNE WHO HAD CERTAINLY AN UNPRAISEWORTHY TENACITY FOR HOLDING GRUDGES SHE WAS AS INTENSE IN HER HATREDS AS IN HER LOVES
THERE ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR HUNG PATHETICALLY EMPTY AND FORMLESS THE RED WRAPPER WITH BLACK DOTS THAT SHE ALWAYS WORE WHILE GETTING THE MEALS HER WEEK DAY CLOTHES HAD BEEN TOSSED HERE AND THERE IN HER HASTE
AND THE BOTTLE OF STRAWBERRY MARMALADE BLUSHING AT THE CERTIFICATE OF CHEMICAL PURITY ON ITS LABEL AFTER DINNER KATY WOULD SHOW HIM THE NEW PATCH IN HER CRAZY QUILT THAT THE ICEMAN HAD CUT FOR HER OFF THE END OF HIS FOUR IN HAND
NOR CLICKING CUE COULD WOO THE REMORSEFUL SOUL OF PERKINS THE BEREFT THE THING THAT WAS HIS LIGHTLY HELD AND HALF SCORNED HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM AND HE WANTED IT BACKWARD TO A CERTAIN MAN NAMED ADAM
I'M A DOUBLE DYED DUB MUSED JOHN PERKINS THE WAY I'VE BEEN TREATING KATY OFF EVERY NIGHT PLAYING POOL AND BUMMING WITH THE BOYS INSTEAD OF STAYING HOME WITH HER THE POOR GIRL HERE ALL ALONE WITH NOTHING TO AMUSE HER AND ME ACTING THAT WAY
THERE AMID THE STEAM OF VEGETABLES AND THE VAPOURS OF ACRES OF HAM AND THE CRASH OF CROCKERY THE CLATTER OF STEEL THE SCREAMING OF SHORT ORDERS THE CRIES OF THE HUNGERING AND ALL THE HORRID TUMULT OF FEEDING MAN
A LITTLE PAPER BAG OF HER FAVORITE BUTTER SCOTCH LAY WITH ITS STRING YET UNWOUND A DAILY PAPER SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR GAPING RECTANGULARLY WHERE A RAILROAD TIME TABLE HAD BEEN CLIPPED FROM IT EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM SPOKE OF A LOSS
PROMPTLY ON TIME THE COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENT OF MOUNTED POLICEMAN O'ROON SINGLE FOOTED INTO THE PARK ON HIS CHESTNUT STEED IN A UNIFORM TWO MEN WHO ARE UNLIKE WILL LOOK ALIKE
THE TWO RODE SIDE BY SIDE DURING THE FAMOUS MOOTED UP HILL CHARGE THAT WAS DISPUTED SO HOTLY AT THE TIME BY THE SPANIARDS AND AFTERWARD BY THE DEMOCRATS AFTER THE WAR REMSEN CAME BACK TO HIS POLO AND SHAD
JOHN SEIZED IT IT WAS A NOTE FROM HIS WIFE RUNNING THUS DEAR JOHN I JUST HAD A TELEGRAM SAYING MOTHER IS VERY SICK
THE PENDULUM EIGHTY FIRST STREET LET EM OUT PLEASE YELLED THE SHEPHERD IN BLUE A FLOCK OF CITIZEN SHEEP SCRAMBLED OUT AND ANOTHER FLOCK SCRAMBLED ABOARD
THAT WOULD HAVE DRAWN SAINT PYRITES FROM HIS IRON PILLAR OR WHATEVER THE ALLUSION IS AND OF THE LADY'S SMILE AND LOOK A LITTLE FRIGHTENED BUT A LOOK THAT WITH THE EVER COWARD HEART OF A TRUE LOVER HE COULD NOT YET CONSTRUE
MILLY STEERED HER MAGNIFICENT WAY LIKE SOME GREAT LINER CLEAVING AMONG THE CANOES OF HOWLING SAVAGES OUR GODDESS OF GRUB WAS BUILT ON LINES SO MAJESTIC THAT THEY COULD BE FOLLOWED ONLY WITH AWE
YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE DIAMOND TIARAS ON MILLY'S BROW AND THE HAND EMBROIDERED SILK PARIS GOWNS THAT HE MEANT TO BUY FOR HER AT LAST THE BOLLWORM HAD ATTACKED THE COTTON THE POISON IVY WAS REACHING OUT ITS TENDRILS TO ENTWINE THE SUMMER BOARDER
THE DRIVER RELEASED HIS HANDS FROM THE WRAPPED REINS JUMPED FROM HIS SEAT AND STOOD AT THE HEADS OF THE TEAM THE CHESTNUT APPROVING HIS NEW RIDER DANCED AND PRANCED REVILING EQUINELY THE SUBDUED BAYS
HER VOICE RANG LIKE A GREAT SILVER BELL HER SMILE WAS MANY TOOTHED AND FREQUENT SHE SEEMED LIKE A YELLOW SUNRISE ON MOUNTAIN TOPS I NEVER SAW HER BUT I THOUGHT OF THE YOSEMITE
STUFFED PTARMIGANS BEAD WORK AND SEAL PELTS OF THE RETURNED KLONDIKER AND BEGAN TO PRATE TO US OF HIS MILLIONS BANK DRAFTS FOR TWO MILLIONS WAS HIS SUMMING UP
DING DING THE CATTLE CARS OF THE MANHATTAN ELEVATED RATTLED AWAY AND JOHN PERKINS DRIFTED DOWN THE STAIRWAY OF THE STATION WITH THE RELEASED FLOCK JOHN WALKED SLOWLY TOWARD HIS FLAT
NOW WHERE ARE YOU GOING I'D LIKE TO KNOW JOHN PERKINS
BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF THE VERY HAND OF DEATH HAD POINTED A FINGER AT HIS SECURE AND UNEVENTFUL HOME JOHN DRAGGED THE COLD MUTTON FROM THE ICE BOX
THERE HE RUMBLED A ROUGHLY GOOD HUMOURED PROTEST THAT'S THE GIRL FOR MY MONEY HE DECLARED SHE CAN EAT OUT OF MY SKILLET THE REST OF HER LIFE WHY I NEVER SEE SUCH A FINE GIRL I'M GOING BACK THERE AND ASK HER TO MARRY ME
SHE WAS A GRAND EXAMPLE OF KRAFT'S THEORY OF THE ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE SHE BELONGED LARGELY TO WAITING AS MINERVA DID TO THE ART OF SCRAPPING OR VENUS TO THE SCIENCE OF SERIOUS FLIRTATION
I LOOKED BACK AND SAW HIM SHAKING WITH INAUDIBLE LAUGHTER BEHIND HIS FILM NOW AND THEN WE PAID UP BACK SCORES BUT THE CHIEF THING AT CYPHER'S WAS MILLY MILLY WAS A WAITRESS
MORE EXQUISITE THAN THE FIRST QUARTER MOON VIEWED AT TWILIGHT THROUGH THE TOPS OF OLEANDERS REMSEN SAW HER AND KNEW HIS FATE HE COULD HAVE FLUNG HIMSELF UNDER THE VERY WHEELS THAT CONVEYED HER
SPEAK I INTERRUPTED MUCH PERTURBED YOU DO NOT THINK THAT MILLY WILL BEGIN TO LACE ONE DAY CONCLUDED KRAFT SOLEMNLY THERE WILL COME TO CYPHER'S FOR A PLATE OF BEANS A MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN FROM WISCONSIN
AH YOU'RE ALL RIGHT O'ROON COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT MORE NEATLY
OUR PATHS SEPARATED AND I SAW KRAFT NO MORE AND JUDKINS SELDOM BUT AS I SAID I SAW A PAINTING THE OTHER DAY THAT WAS SOLD FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE TITLE WAS BOADICEA
MA WASN'T SICK TO AMOUNT TO ANYTHING
SLOWLY BECAUSE IN THE LEXICON OF HIS DAILY LIFE THERE WAS NO SUCH WORD AS PERHAPS THERE ARE NO SURPRISES AWAITING A MAN WHO HAS BEEN MARRIED TWO YEARS AND LIVES IN A FLAT AS HE WALKED
THE COTTON HAS ITS BOLLWORM THE CHORUS GIRL HAS HER PITTSBURGER THE SUMMER BOARDER HAS HIS POISON IVY THE HERO HAS HIS CARNEGIE MEDAL ART HAS ITS MORGAN THE ROSE HAS ITS
LOOMED UP BIG AND WHITE AND PINK AND AWFUL AS MOUNT SAINT ELIAS WITH A SMILE LIKE DAY BREAKING IN A GULCH AND THE KLONDIKER THREW DOWN HIS PELTS AND NUGGETS AS DROSS AND LET HIS JAW FALL HALF WAY AND STARED AT HER
BECAUSE HE HAD A NAME TO GIVE WHICH WITHOUT UNDUE PRIDE WAS WORTHY OF BEING SPOKEN IN HIGH PLACES AND A SMALL FORTUNE WHICH WITH DUE PRIDE HE COULD LEAVE AT HIS END WITHOUT DISGRACE HE OPENED HIS LIPS TO SPEAK
AND SCOTCH CAP FROM POSSIBLE DEATH WHERE WAS POLICEMAN O'ROON OFF HIS BEAT EXPOSED DISGRACED DISCHARGED
IF YOU DAMAGED THAT HORSE OF MINE I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU I'M GOING TO BUY HIM AND TAKE HIM BACK WITH ME OH YES AND I THINK MY SISTER LADY ANGELA YOU KNOW WANTS PARTICULARLY FOR YOU TO COME UP TO THE HOTEL WITH ME THIS EVENING
AND THE FIGURE SEEMED TO FILL ALL OUT OF DOORS BUT OF ALL THE PICTURE'S ADMIRERS WHO STOOD BEFORE IT I BELIEVE I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO LONGED FOR BOADICEA TO STALK FROM HER FRAME BRINGING ME CORNED BEEF HASH WITH POACHED EGG
NO TROUBLE AT ALL SAID REMSEN I KNOW A LOT OF MEN WHO HAVE BANKS AND STORES AND THINGS DOWNTOWN ANY PARTICULAR LINE YOU FANCY YES SAID O'ROON WITH A LOOK OF INTEREST I TOOK A WALK IN YOUR CENTRAL PARK THIS MORNING
AND NOW AT THE EXTREME RISK OF WEARYING OLD GENTLEMEN WHO CARRY LEATHER FOB CHAINS AND ELDERLY LADIES WHO BUT NO GRANDMOTHER HERSELF YET THRILLS AT FOOLISH IMMORTAL ROMEO THERE MUST BE A HINT OF LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
THREE YEARS AGO KRAFT BILL JUDKINS A POET AND I TOOK OUR MEALS AT CYPHER'S ON EIGHTH AVENUE I SAY TOOK WHEN WE HAD MONEY CYPHER GOT IT OFF OF US AS HE EXPRESSED IT
WHICH COULD NOT BE WORN WHILE DRIVING EXCEPT BY A PERSONAGE AT HIS SIDE SAT THE LADY OF REMSEN'S HEART THE LADY WHO LOOKED LIKE POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS AND THE GIBBOUS MOON REMSEN MET THEM COMING
WHO SAT BY THE WINDOW SMOKING CIGARS I WISH YOU AND THE REST OF THE POLICE FORCE AND ALL BADGES HORSES BRASS BUTTONS AND MEN WHO CAN'T DRINK TWO GLASSES OF BRUT WITHOUT GETTING UPSET WERE AT THE DEVIL SAID REMSEN FEELINGLY
I'D LIKE TO BE ONE OF THOSE BOBBIES ON HORSEBACK THAT WOULD BE ABOUT THE TICKET BESIDES IT'S THE ONLY THING I COULD DO I CAN RIDE A LITTLE AND THE FRESH AIR SUITS ME THINK YOU COULD LAND THAT FOR ME
AND THE WILD MEN OF THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE EAST IN KHAKI THERE IS LITTLE TELLING THEM ONE FROM ANOTHER SO THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS AND COMRADES ALL AROUND ELLSWORTH REMSEN WHOSE OLD KNICKERBOCKER DESCENT
AT THE INSTANT OF THEIR PASSING HER EYES LOOKED INTO HIS AND BUT FOR THE EVER COWARD'S HEART OF A TRUE LOVER HE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT SHE FLUSHED A FAINT PINK
HAD BEEN SHARPLY STIRRED BY THE LOSS OF HER PRESENCE HAS IT NOT BEEN DINNED INTO US BY PROVERB AND SERMON AND FABLE THAT WE NEVER PRIZE THE MUSIC TILL THE SWEET VOICED BIRD HAS FLOWN
HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR ALL HIS NEGLECT WHAT WAS LIFE WITHOUT HER THE DOOR OPENED KATY WALKED IN CARRYING A LITTLE HAND SATCHEL JOHN STARED AT HER STUPIDLY MY I'M GLAD TO GET BACK SAID KATY
ONCE FORTUNE SMILED UPON THEM STRAIGHT TO NEW YORK THEY HIE AND LAY THEIR GOODS AT THE FEET OF THE GIRL WHO SERVES THEM BEANS IN A BEANERY WHY THE ALPHABET ITSELF CONNIVES THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPER'S HEADLINER'S WORK IS CUT FOR HIM
HIS HOME WAS DISMANTLED
ALL ABOUT LAY HER THINGS IN CONFUSION SHOES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR CURLING TONGS HAIR BOWS KIMONOS POWDER BOX JUMBLED TOGETHER ON DRESSER AND CHAIRS THIS WAS NOT KATY'S WAY
IT CAME JUST AS REMSEN WAS STROLLING INTO FIFTH AVENUE FROM HIS CLUB A FEW DOORS AWAY A MOTOR CAR WAS CREEPING ALONG FOOT BY FOOT IMPEDED BY A FRESHET OF VEHICLES THAT FILLED THE STREET
BUT THESE TWO WERE OF NO CONSEQUENCE EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR THE GUIDING OF THE MACHINE AND THE PAYING FOR IT AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE SAT A YOUNG LADY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS
HER SLEEVES WERE ALWAYS ROLLED ABOVE HER ELBOWS SHE COULD HAVE TAKEN US THREE MUSKETEERS IN HER TWO HANDS AND DROPPED US OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE HAD SEEN FEWER YEARS THAN ANY OF US BUT SHE WAS OF SUCH SUPERB EVEHOOD AND SIMPLICITY THAT SHE MOTHERED US FROM THE BEGINNING
THEN SAID I WHEN YOU LED US AGAINST THE LUMBERMAN THE KLONDIKER IT WASN'T ALTOGETHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE WELL
OF LATE SUCH HAD BEEN JOHN PERKINS'S HABIT AT TEN OR ELEVEN HE WOULD RETURN SOMETIMES KATY WOULD BE ASLEEP SOMETIMES WAITING UP
HIS LEGS DECLINED TO FULFIL THE OBLIGATIONS THEY HAD SWORN TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT I'M STEWED REMSEN SAID O'ROON TO HIS FRIEND WHY DO THEY BUILD HOTELS THAT GO ROUND AND ROUND LIKE CATHERINE WHEELS
LUCKILY FOR REMSEN'S PEACE OF MIND THERE CAME A DIVERSION IN THE GUISE OF A REUNION OF THE GENTLE RIDERS OF THE CITY THERE WERE NOT MANY OF THEM PERHAPS A SCORE AND THERE WAS WASSAIL AND THINGS TO EAT
HE WAS RUGGED AND BEARDED AND WIND DRIED HE HAD JUST COME OFF THE TRAIL HE SAID AT ONE OF THE NORTH RIVER FERRIES I FANCIED I COULD SEE THE SNOW DUST OF CHILCOOT YET POWDERING HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN HE STREWED THE TABLE WITH THE NUGGETS
WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE CAMPS HE ASSAULTED OUR EARS AND CLAIMED THE FELLOWSHIP OF MEN LOST IN THE WILDS OF A HASH HOUSE WE EMBRACED HIM AS A SPECIMEN AND IN THREE MINUTES WE HAD ALL BUT DIED FOR ONE ANOTHER AS FRIENDS
WITH YOUR BADGE ON YOUR HORSE IN YOUR UNIFORM WILL I CHARM NURSE MAIDS AND PREVENT THE GRASS FROM GROWING UNDER PEOPLE'S FEET IN THE PARK THIS DAY I WILL HAVE YOUR BADGE AND YOUR HONOR BESIDES HAVING THE JOLLIEST LARK I'VE BEEN BLESSED WITH SINCE WE LICKED SPAIN
OF RUSSIANS AND JAPS SLAUGHTERED BY THE DEADLY LINOTYPE FOR DINNER THERE WOULD BE POT ROAST A SALAD FLAVORED WITH A DRESSING WARRANTED NOT TO CRACK OR INJURE THE LEATHER STEWED RHUBARB
THESE CONDITIONS BEING AGREED TO
AND HELD THEIR STOOLS IN HAND QUITE READY TO SIT DOWN THEIR JAWS MOVED PRELIMINARILY WITH FEARFUL THREATENINGS INDEED THOUGHT PORTHOS CASTING A GLANCE AT THE THREE HUNGRY CLERKS
PORTHOS MADE A MOST SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE
THE MUSKETEER COULD NOT FORGET THE EVIL REPORTS WHICH THEN PREVAILED AND WHICH INDEED HAVE SURVIVED THEM OF THE PROCURATORS OF THE PERIOD MEANNESS STINGINESS FASTS BUT AS AFTER ALL
TO WHOM ANNE OF AUSTRIA OWED THE EXTRAORDINARY TRIUMPH SHE HAD OBTAINED OVER THE CARDINAL AND WHO CONFOUNDED UNKNOWN LOST IN THE CROWD GATHERED AT ONE OF THE DOORS
AND THEY REQUIRE MANY THINGS USELESS TO THE GUARDSMEN OR THE SWISS BUT YET DETAIL THEM TO ME WHY THEY MAY AMOUNT TO SAID PORTHOS WHO PREFERRED DISCUSSING THE TOTAL TO TAKING THEM ONE BY ONE
A PRIVATE ROOM HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE KING AND ANOTHER FOR MONSIEUR
ON THE EVENING BEFORE THEY HAD SCARCELY SEEN EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT AT THE APARTMENT OF THE SWISS GUARD GERMAIN WHITHER D'ARTAGNAN HAD SENT FOR HER
WHICH SEEMED TO ASTONISH THE PERSONS WHO SURROUNDED HER AND WHO WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HER ALMOST ALWAYS SAD AND FULL OF CARE THE QUEEN ATTRIBUTED THIS JOYOUS FEELING TO THE BEAUTY OF THE FETE
AH MADAME SAID PORTHOS HAUGHTILY DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A BEGGAR NO
AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM UNCLOSED WITH A CREAK AND PORTHOS PERCEIVED THROUGH THE HALF OPEN FLAP THE LITTLE CLERK WHO NOT BEING ALLOWED TO TAKE PART IN THE FEAST ATE HIS DRY BREAD IN THE PASSAGE WITH THE DOUBLE ODOR OF THE DINING ROOM AND KITCHEN
BUT THE KING TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE PRIVILEGE HE HAD OF LEAVING HIS LADY TO ADVANCE EAGERLY TOWARD THE QUEEN I THANK YOU MADAME SAID HE FOR THE DEFERENCE YOU HAVE SHOWN TO MY WISHES BUT I THINK YOU WANT TWO OF THE STUDS AND I BRING THEM BACK TO YOU
YOU ARE CERTAINLY TREATING YOUR COUSIN VERY HANDSOMELY THE POOR FOWL WAS THIN AND COVERED WITH ONE OF THOSE THICK BRISTLY SKINS THROUGH WHICH THE TEETH CANNOT PENETRATE WITH ALL THEIR EFFORTS THE FOWL MUST HAVE BEEN SOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME ON THE PERCH
AND THE CLOCK OF SAINT JEAN HAD STRUCK THREE QUARTERS PAST TWO THE SOUND OF VOICES DIMINISHED BY DEGREES IN THE ADJOINING CHAMBER THE COMPANY WAS THEN HEARD DEPARTING THEN THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET IN WHICH D'ARTAGNAN WAS WAS OPENED
THESE KEYS WERE GIVEN UP TO HIM INSTANTLY EACH OF THEM HAD TICKET ATTACHED TO IT BY WHICH IT MIGHT BE RECOGNIZED AND FROM THAT MOMENT THE SIEUR DE LA COSTE WAS CHARGED WITH THE CARE OF ALL THE DOORS AND ALL THE AVENUES
BUT OF WHAT THEN DOES THE EQUIPMENT OF YOUR COMPANY CONSIST MONSIEUR PORTHOS OH OF MANY THINGS SAID PORTHOS THE MUSKETEERS ARE AS YOU KNOW PICKED SOLDIERS
WAS DRAWN AND THE PALE FACE OF THE CARDINAL APPEARED HE BEING DRESSED AS A SPANISH CAVALIER HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THOSE OF THE QUEEN AND A SMILE OF TERRIBLE JOY PASSED OVER HIS LIPS THE QUEEN DID NOT WEAR HER DIAMOND STUDS
AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORTHY LADY RELIEVED HIM FROM AN AWKWARD EMBARRASSMENT THE CLERKS SURVEYED HIM WITH GREAT CURIOSITY AND HE NOT KNOWING WELL WHAT TO SAY TO THIS ASCENDING AND DESCENDING SCALE REMAINED TONGUE TIED
THE HASTE WHICH THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS IN TO CONVEY TO THE QUEEN THE EXCELLENT NEWS OF THE HAPPY RETURN OF HER MESSENGER PREVENTED THE TWO LOVERS FROM EXCHANGING MORE THAN A FEW WORDS
THEN CONTINUED HE THERE IS A HORSE FOR MY LACKEY AND MY VALISE
THE YOUNG MEN FILLED UP THEIR THIRD OF A GLASS WITH WATER THEN WHEN THEY HAD DRUNK HALF THE GLASS THEY FILLED IT UP AGAIN AND CONTINUED TO DO SO THIS BROUGHT THEM BY THE END OF THE REPAST TO SWALLOWING A DRINK
FOR THE ERRAND BOY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED WAS NOT ADMITTED TO THE HONORS OF THE MAGISTERIAL TABLE IN MY COUSIN'S PLACE I WOULD NOT KEEP SUCH GOURMANDS THEY LOOK LIKE SHIPWRECKED SAILORS WHO HAVE NOT EATEN FOR SIX WEEKS
THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE WAITED TREMBLINGLY TO HOW MUCH SAID SHE I HOPE IT DOES NOT EXCEED SHE STOPPED
THE FACE OF THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS COVERED WITH A BLACK VELVET MASK BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS PRECAUTION WHICH WAS IN FACT TAKEN RATHER AGAINST OTHERS THAN AGAINST HIM HE AT ONCE RECOGNIZED HIS USUAL GUIDE THE LIGHT AND INTELLIGENT
LITTERED WITH PAPERS ON QUITTING THE STUDY THEY LEFT THE KITCHEN ON THE RIGHT AND ENTERED THE RECEPTION ROOM ALL THESE ROOMS WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH ONE ANOTHER DID NOT INSPIRE PORTHOS FAVORABLY WORDS MIGHT BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE THROUGH ALL THESE OPEN DOORS
FREQUENTLY CAST HIS EYES WITH GREAT UNEASINESS UPON A LARGE CHEST PLACED IN FRONT OF HIS OAK DESK PORTHOS COMPREHENDED THAT THIS CHEST ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT CORRESPOND IN SHAPE WITH THAT WHICH HE HAD SEEN IN HIS DREAMS MUST BE THE BLESSED COFFER
WHOM PORTHOS ASSISTED IN ROLLING HER HUSBAND UP TO THE TABLE
AND IN WHICH THEIR MAJESTIES WERE TO DANCE THE FAMOUS LA MERLAISON THE FAVORITE BALLET OF THE KING
PORTHOS LOOKED AT THE BOTTLE WHICH WAS NEAR HIM AND HOPED THAT WITH WINE BREAD AND CHEESE HE MIGHT MAKE A DINNER BUT WINE WAS WANTING THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTY
THIS SUCCOR WHICH CAME TO PORTHOS AT THE MOMENT IN WHICH HE WAS ATTACKED IN HIS GASTRONOMIC HOPES INSPIRED MUCH GRATITUDE IN THE MUSKETEER TOWARD THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE THE HOUR OF DINNER SOON ARRIVED
WELL AGREED FOR A PRETTY MULE SAID PORTHOS YOU ARE RIGHT I HAVE SEEN VERY GREAT SPANISH NOBLES WHOSE WHOLE SUITE WERE MOUNTED ON MULES BUT THEN YOU UNDERSTAND MADAME COQUENARD A MULE WITH FEATHERS AND BELLS
UPON THE EDGE OF WHICH FOR STILL GREATER PRECAUTION HE PLACED HIS FEET THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE TOOK PORTHOS INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM AND THEY BEGAN TO LAY THE BASIS OF A RECONCILIATION YOU CAN COME AND DINE THREE TIMES A WEEK
IN THEIR UTMOST NICETY AND WINNING FROM THEM BY WAY OF FEE FOR THE LESSON HE WOULD GIVE THEM IN AN HOUR THEIR SAVINGS OF A MONTH ALL THIS WAS ENORMOUSLY DELIGHTFUL TO PORTHOS
THE KING TREMBLED WITH JOY AND THE CARDINAL WITH VEXATION
AND HIS HIGHNESS MONSIEUR WITH THE QUEEN THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND THE BALLET BEGAN THE KING DANCED FACING THE QUEEN AND EVERY TIME HE PASSED BY HER HE DEVOURED WITH HIS EYES THOSE STUDS OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ASCERTAIN THE NUMBER
A PROCURATOR'S DINNER HOWEVER BRILLIANT HAD BEEN THE PART PLAYED BY PORTHOS IN THE DUEL IT HAD NOT MADE HIM FORGET THE DINNER OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE ON THE MORROW HE RECEIVED THE LAST TOUCHES OF MOUSQUETON'S BRUSH FOR AN HOUR
THE MILITARY DRESS WHICH INDICATED RANK AND A RUDDY COUNTENANCE WHICH INDICATED FAMILIARITY WITH GOOD LIVING A SHORTER CLERK CAME BEHIND THE FIRST A TALLER CLERK BEHIND THE SECOND
THE BLACK FEET OF THE FOWL AND THE ONLY MUTTON BONE ON WHICH THERE WAS THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF MEAT PORTHOS FANCIED THEY WERE MYSTIFYING HIM AND BEGAN TO CURL HIS MUSTACHE AND KNIT HIS EYEBROWS
THE CITY CARPENTERS HAD ERECTED SCAFFOLDS UPON WHICH THE INVITED LADIES WERE TO BE PLACED THE CITY GROCER HAD ORNAMENTED THE CHAMBERS WITH TWO HUNDRED FLAMBEAUX OF WHITE WAX A PIECE OF LUXURY UNHEARD OF AT THAT PERIOD
A NOTE WHICH YOU WILL FIND AT HOME WILL TELL YOU BEGONE BEGONE AT THESE WORDS SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE CORRIDOR AND PUSHED D'ARTAGNAN OUT OF THE ROOM D'ARTAGNAN OBEYED LIKE A CHILD WITHOUT THE LEAST RESISTANCE OR OBJECTION
AND TOOK FROM A BUFFET A PIECE OF CHEESE SOME PRESERVED QUINCES AND A CAKE WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF MADE OF ALMONDS AND HONEY
AND YET AT THE VERY DOOR THE MUSKETEER BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN SOME DOUBTS THE APPROACH WAS NOT SUCH AS TO PREPOSSESS PEOPLE
BEFORE ENTERING HIS CLOSET THE KING DESIRED TO BE INFORMED THE MOMENT THE CARDINAL ARRIVED HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE ENTRANCE OF THE KING FRESH ACCLAMATIONS WERE HEARD THESE ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF THE QUEEN
IN FACT THE KING COUNTED THEM AND THE TWELVE STUDS WERE ALL ON HER MAJESTY'S SHOULDER THE KING CALLED THE CARDINAL WHAT DOES THIS MEAN MONSIEUR CARDINAL ASKED THE KING IN A SEVERE TONE THIS MEANS SIRE REPLIED THE CARDINAL
CUT OFF THE NECK WHICH WITH THE HEAD SHE PUT ON ONE SIDE FOR HERSELF RAISED THE WING FOR PORTHOS AND THEN RETURNED THE BIRD OTHERWISE INTACT TO THE SERVANT WHO HAD BROUGHT IT IN
TO THE SHAME OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE AND HIS OWN REGRET THAT HE DID NOT SEE THAT FIRE THAT ANIMATION THAT BUSTLE WHICH WHEN A GOOD REPAST IS ON FOOT PREVAILS GENERALLY IN THAT SANCTUARY OF GOOD LIVING
MY HUSBAND HAS FIVE OR SIX VALISES YOU SHALL CHOOSE THE BEST THERE IS ONE IN PARTICULAR WHICH HE PREFERS IN HIS JOURNEYS LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL THE WORLD YOUR VALISE IS THEN EMPTY ASKED PORTHOS WITH SIMPLICITY
IN WHICH THE WHOLE OF HIS SLENDER BODY WAS CONCEALED WAS BRISK AND DRY HIS LITTLE GRAY EYES SHONE LIKE CARBUNCLES AND APPEARED WITH HIS GRINNING MOUTH TO BE THE ONLY PART OF HIS FACE IN WHICH LIFE SURVIVED
I CAN SEND FOR THEM TO THE LOUVRE WHERE THEY ARE AND THUS YOUR MAJESTY'S WISHES WILL BE COMPLIED WITH DO SO MADAME DO SO AND THAT AT ONCE FOR WITHIN AN HOUR THE BALLET WILL COMMENCE THE QUEEN BENT IN TOKEN OF SUBMISSION
HE WAS ABOUT TO SEE IN REALITY A CERTAIN COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD TWENTY TIMES BEHELD THE IMAGE IN HIS DREAMS A COFFER LONG AND DEEP LOCKED BOLTED FASTENED IN THE WALL A COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN HEARD
AS IT CAME IN SEARCH OF HIS HE ALSO DRANK HALF A GLASS OF THIS SPARINGLY SERVED WINE AND FOUND IT TO BE NOTHING BUT THAT HORRIBLE MONTREUIL THE TERROR OF ALL EXPERT PALATES
SMILED A LITTLE AND COLORED A GREAT DEAL
BE SATISFIED SAID THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE THERE REMAINS THE VALISE ADDED PORTHOS
THAT WE MUST ENTREAT HIM TO GIVE US EVERY INSTANT HE CAN CALL HIS OWN PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE OH MY LEGS MY POOR LEGS WHERE ARE YOU MURMURED COQUENARD AND HE TRIED TO SMILE
I WISHED TO KNOW THE DETAIL SAID SHE BECAUSE HAVING MANY RELATIVES IN BUSINESS I WAS ALMOST SURE OF OBTAINING THINGS AT A HUNDRED PER CENT LESS THAN YOU WOULD PAY YOURSELF AH AH SAID PORTHOS
HIS HEART BEAT BUT NOT LIKE D'ARTAGNAN'S WITH A YOUNG AND IMPATIENT LOVE NO A MORE MATERIAL INTEREST STIRRED HIS BLOOD HE WAS ABOUT AT LAST TO PASS THAT MYSTERIOUS THRESHOLD
AND MONSIEUR AND THE OTHER NOBLES WERE DRESSED LIKE HIM THIS WAS THE COSTUME THAT BEST BECAME THE KING SO DRESSED HE REALLY APPEARED THE FIRST GENTLEMAN OF HIS KINGDOM
WHICH WAS ENTIRELY DARK AND LED D'ARTAGNAN INTO IT THERE SHE MADE A FRESH SIGN OF SILENCE AND OPENED A SECOND DOOR CONCEALED BY TAPESTRY THE OPENING OF THIS DOOR DISCLOSED A BRILLIANT LIGHT AND SHE DISAPPEARED
EACH HOLDING A FLAMBEAU IN HIS HAND WENT TO ATTEND UPON THE KING WHOM THEY MET ON THE STEPS WHERE THE PROVOST OF THE MERCHANTS MADE HIM THE SPEECH OF WELCOME A COMPLIMENT TO WHICH HIS MAJESTY REPLIED WITH AN APOLOGY FOR COMING SO LATE
AND TWICE OR THREE TIMES HE EVEN SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON INTERCEPT THE LIGHT AT LENGTH A HAND AND AN ARM SURPASSINGLY BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR FORM AND WHITENESS GLIDED THROUGH THE TAPESTRY
THE PROCURATOR REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AH MADAME COQUENARD ACCEPT MY COMPLIMENTS YOUR DINNER HAS BEEN A REAL FEAST LORD HOW I HAVE EATEN
THE CARDINAL WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE AND THE KING WAS VERY PALE THE KING MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD WITHOUT A MASK AND THE RIBBONS OF HIS DOUBLET SCARCELY TIED HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE QUEEN AND IN AN ALTERED VOICE SAID
A HORSE FOR YOUR LACKEY RESUMED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE HESITATINGLY
PORTHOS DID NOT FEEL THE RIDICULE OF THIS AND TOOK IT FOR A PIECE OF SIMPLICITY AT WHICH HE LAUGHED IN HIS LARGE MUSTACHE
BUT I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT A BACK DOOR AND STEALING ALONG IN THE SHADE OF THE HEDGE I GAINED YONDER CLUMP OF ELDER FROM WHICH I COULD HEAR AND SEE EVERYTHING THE THREE MEN BROUGHT THE CARRIAGE UP QUIETLY AND TOOK OUT OF IT A LITTLE MAN STOUT SHORT ELDERLY
I ONLY BEG LEAVE TO OBSERVE TO MONSIEUR THAT THE NIGHT WILL BE VERY COLD THAT CHILLS BRING ON RHEUMATISM AND THAT A LACKEY WHO HAS THE RHEUMATISM MAKES BUT A POOR SERVANT PARTICULARLY TO A MASTER AS ACTIVE AS MONSIEUR WELL
SILENT AND OBSCURE WHICH HAD NO DOUBT SEEN ALL AND COULD TELL ITS TALE THE GATE OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS SHUT BUT HE LEAPED OVER THE HEDGE AND IN SPITE OF THE BARKING OF A CHAINED UP DOG WENT UP TO THE CABIN NO ONE ANSWERED TO HIS FIRST KNOCKING
AND NO ONE COULD FIND FAULT WITH IT AH MONSIEUR
THEN I SAW NO MORE BUT I HEARD THE NOISE OF BREAKING FURNITURE THE WOMAN SCREAMED AND CRIED FOR HELP BUT HER CRIES WERE SOON STIFLED TWO OF THE MEN APPEARED BEARING THE WOMAN IN THEIR ARMS AND CARRIED HER TO THE CARRIAGE INTO WHICH THE LITTLE OLD MAN GOT AFTER HER
THE OLD MAN READ SO MUCH TRUTH AND SO MUCH GRIEF IN THE FACE OF THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE MADE HIM A SIGN TO LISTEN AND REPEATED IN A LOW VOICE IT WAS SCARCELY NINE O'CLOCK WHEN I HEARD A NOISE IN THE STREET AND WAS WONDERING WHAT IT COULD BE
FOR NOTHING HAD LED HIM TO THE EXAMINATION THAT THE GROUND TRAMPLED HERE AND HOOFMARKED THERE PRESENTED CONFUSED TRACES OF MEN AND HORSES BESIDES THE WHEELS OF A CARRIAGE WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE COME FROM PARIS HAD MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION IN THE SOFT EARTH
OH MONSIEUR SAID THE OLD MAN ASK ME NOTHING FOR IF I DARED TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE SEEN CERTAINLY NO GOOD WOULD BEFALL ME YOU HAVE THEN SEEN SOMETHING REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN IN THAT CASE IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN CONTINUED HE THROWING HIM A PISTOLE
D'ARTAGNAN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE LAMP WHICH BURNED IN THE CABIN OF THE FERRYMAN
AND THAT FRESH INFORMATION AWAITED HIM THE LANE WAS STILL DESERTED
IT WAS A STRANGE THING AND ONE WHICH MADE D'ARTAGNAN TREMBLE FROM THE SOLE OF HIS FOOT TO THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR TO FIND THAT THIS SOFT LIGHT THIS CALM LAMP ENLIGHTENED A SCENE OF FEARFUL DISORDER ONE OF THE WINDOWS WAS BROKEN
HE WENT AND RESUMED HIS POST BEGINNING TO BE RATHER UNEASY AT THIS SILENCE AND THIS SOLITUDE ELEVEN O'CLOCK SOUNDED
AFTER HAVING CAST A GLANCE BEHIND IT BEYOND THAT HEDGE THAT GARDEN AND THAT COTTAGE A DARK MIST ENVELOPED WITH ITS FOLDS THAT IMMENSITY WHERE PARIS SLEPT A VAST VOID FROM WHICH GLITTERED A FEW LUMINOUS POINTS THE FUNERAL STARS OF THAT HELL
RECURRING TO HIS BESETTING IDEA THAT MONSIEUR BONACIEUX HAS SOMETHING VICIOUS IN HIS EYEBROWS AND SOMETHING VERY UNPLEASANT IN THE PLAY OF HIS LIPS WHAT THE DEVIL MAKES YOU THINK OF BONACIEUX MONSIEUR WE THINK OF WHAT WE CAN
DO NOT TAKE ON SO THEY DID NOT KILL HER AND THAT'S A COMFORT CAN YOU GUESS SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS THE MAN WHO HEADED THIS INFERNAL EXPEDITION I DON'T KNOW HIM BUT AS YOU SPOKE TO HIM YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HIM
IT CAME INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S MIND THAT BY REMAINING IN THE ENVIRONS OF THE SPOT ON WHICH THIS SAD EVENT HAD PASSED HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE SOME LIGHT THROWN UPON THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT THE SIXTH CABARET THEN AS WE SAID D'ARTAGNAN STOPPED
AND SATISFY HIMSELF THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN MISTAKEN THAT THE APPOINTMENT WAS AT SAINT CLOUD AND NOT ELSEWHERE BEFORE THE D'ESTREES'S PAVILION AND NOT IN ANOTHER STREET EVERYTHING CONSPIRED TO PROVE TO D'ARTAGNAN THAT HIS PRESENTIMENTS HAD NOT DECEIVED HIM
WE MUST NOT DISSEMBLE THAT THE OSCILLATION OF THE TALL TREES AND THE REFLECTION OF THE MOON IN THE DARK UNDERWOOD GAVE HIM SERIOUS UNEASINESS D'ARTAGNAN COULD NOT HELP PERCEIVING THAT SOMETHING MORE THAN USUAL WAS PASSING IN THE MIND OF HIS LACKEY AND SAID WELL MONSIEUR PLANCHET
HE HASTENED TO DESCEND INTO THE STREET WITH A FRIGHTFUL BEATING AT HIS HEART HE WISHED TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND OTHER TRACES OF VIOLENCE THE LITTLE SOFT LIGHT SHONE ON IN THE CALMNESS OF THE NIGHT D'ARTAGNAN THEN PERCEIVED A THING THAT HE HAD NOT BEFORE REMARKED
ASKED FOR A BOTTLE OF WINE OF THE BEST QUALITY AND PLACING HIMSELF IN THE DARKEST CORNER OF THE ROOM DETERMINED THUS TO WAIT TILL DAYLIGHT BUT THIS TIME AGAIN HIS HOPES WERE DISAPPOINTED
WHEN ON COMING TO MY DOOR I FOUND THAT SOMEBODY WAS ENDEAVORING TO OPEN IT AS I AM VERY POOR AND AM NOT AFRAID OF BEING ROBBED I WENT AND OPENED THE GATE AND SAW THREE MEN AT A FEW PACES FROM IT IN THE SHADOW WAS A CARRIAGE WITH TWO HORSES AND SOME SADDLEHORSES
THE LEADER CLOSED THE WINDOW CAME OUT AN INSTANT AFTER BY THE DOOR AND SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THE WOMAN WAS IN THE CARRIAGE HIS TWO COMPANIONS WERE ALREADY ON HORSEBACK HE SPRANG INTO HIS SADDLE THE LACKEY TOOK HIS PLACE BY THE COACHMAN
THESE HORSES EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE THREE MEN WHO WERE DRESSED AS CAVALIERS AH MY WORTHY GENTLEMEN CRIED I WHAT DO YOU WANT
THE BELFRY OF SAINT CLOUD SOUNDED HALF PAST TEN THIS TIME WITHOUT KNOWING WHY D'ARTAGNAN FELT A COLD SHIVER RUN THROUGH HIS VEINS PERHAPS THE COLD BEGAN TO AFFECT HIM AND HE TOOK A PERFECTLY PHYSICAL SENSATION FOR A MORAL IMPRESSION
D'ARTAGNAN WENT SUCCESSIVELY INTO ALL THE CABARETS IN WHICH THERE WAS A LIGHT
HE IS MY DEMON APPARENTLY AND THE OTHER WHICH THE SHORT ONE OH HE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN I'LL ANSWER FOR IT BESIDES HE DID NOT WEAR A SWORD AND THE OTHERS TREATED HIM WITH SMALL CONSIDERATION SOME LACKEY MURMURED D'ARTAGNAN
BUT CLOSED AGAIN AS SOON AS THE LIGHT FROM A MISERABLE LAMP WHICH BURNED IN THE CORNER HAD SHONE UPON THE BALDRIC SWORD BELT AND PISTOL POMMELS OF D'ARTAGNAN NEVERTHELESS RAPID AS THE MOVEMENT HAD BEEN D'ARTAGNAN HAD HAD TIME TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD MAN
AND NOT OF WHAT WE WILL BECAUSE YOU ARE A COWARD PLANCHET MONSIEUR WE MUST NOT CONFOUND PRUDENCE WITH COWARDICE PRUDENCE IS A VIRTUE AND YOU ARE VERY VIRTUOUS ARE YOU NOT PLANCHET MONSIEUR
WENT OUT BY THE GATE OF LA CONFERENCE AND FOLLOWED THE ROAD MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THEN THAN IT IS NOW WHICH LEADS TO SAINT CLOUD AS LONG AS HE WAS IN THE CITY PLANCHET KEPT AT THE RESPECTFUL DISTANCE HE HAD IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF
HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS THREE TIMES THE ORDINARY SIGNAL OF LOVERS BUT NOBODY REPLIED TO HIM NOT EVEN AN ECHO HE THEN THOUGHT WITH A TOUCH OF VEXATION THAT PERHAPS THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WHILE WAITING FOR HIM HE APPROACHED THE WALL AND TRIED TO CLIMB IT
LISTEN TO ME I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT COME I AM DYING WITH ANXIETY HAS ANYTHING PARTICULAR HAPPENED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SPEAK THE WINDOW WAS AGAIN OPENED SLOWLY AND THE SAME FACE APPEARED ONLY IT WAS NOW STILL MORE PALE THAN BEFORE
AS SOON AS HE HAD LOST SIGHT OF HIS MASTER AND IN SUCH HASTE WAS HE TO WARM HIMSELF THAT HE WENT STRAIGHT TO A HOUSE SET OUT WITH ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF A SUBURBAN TAVERN AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
A SILENCE OF DEATH REIGNED IN THE CABIN AS IN THE PAVILION BUT AS THE CABIN WAS HIS LAST RESOURCE HE KNOCKED AGAIN IT SOON APPEARED TO HIM THAT HE HEARD A SLIGHT NOISE WITHIN A TIMID NOISE WHICH SEEMED TO TREMBLE LEST IT SHOULD BE HEARD
EVERYTHING IN THE APARTMENT GAVE EVIDENCE OF A VIOLENT AND DESPERATE STRUGGLE D'ARTAGNAN EVEN FANCIED HE COULD RECOGNIZE AMID THIS STRANGE DISORDER FRAGMENTS OF GARMENTS AND SOME BLOODY SPOTS STAINING THE CLOTH AND THE CURTAINS
THAT HE HAD READ INCORRECTLY AND THAT THE APPOINTMENT WAS FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK HE DREW NEAR TO THE WINDOW AND PLACING HIMSELF SO THAT A RAY OF LIGHT SHOULD FALL UPON THE LETTER AS HE HELD IT HE DREW IT FROM HIS POCKET AND READ IT AGAIN BUT HE HAD NOT BEEN MISTAKEN THE APPOINTMENT WAS FOR TEN O'CLOCK
HE AGAIN RAN BACK TO THE CHATEAU
YOU CAN GO INTO ONE OF THOSE CABARETS THAT YOU SEE YONDER AND BE IN WAITING FOR ME AT THE DOOR BY SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING MONSIEUR I HAVE EATEN AND DRUNK RESPECTFULLY THE CROWN YOU GAVE ME THIS MORNING
WRAPPED IN THIS SWEET IDEA D'ARTAGNAN WAITED HALF AN HOUR WITHOUT THE LEAST IMPATIENCE HIS EYES FIXED UPON THAT CHARMING LITTLE ABODE OF WHICH HE COULD PERCEIVE A PART OF THE CEILING WITH ITS GILDED MOLDINGS ATTESTING THE ELEGANCE OF THE REST OF THE APARTMENT
TOWARD SIX O'CLOCK D'ARTAGNAN AWOKE WITH THAT UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING WHICH GENERALLY ACCOMPANIES THE BREAK OF DAY AFTER A BAD NIGHT HE WAS NOT LONG IN MAKING HIS TOILET HE EXAMINED HIMSELF TO SEE IF ADVANTAGE HAD BEEN TAKEN OF HIS SLEEP AND
NO YOU ARE AT YOUR JOURNEY'S END HOW MONSIEUR AND YOU I AM GOING A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND MONSIEUR LEAVES ME HERE ALONE YOU ARE AFRAID PLANCHET NO
BUT FOR D'ARTAGNAN ALL ASPECTS WERE CLOTHED HAPPILY ALL IDEAS WORE A SMILE ALL SHADES WERE DIAPHANOUS THE APPOINTED HOUR WAS ABOUT TO STRIKE IN FACT AT THE END OF A FEW MINUTES THE BELFRY OF SAINT CLOUD LET FALL SLOWLY
THEN BOTH MOUNTED AND DEPARTED QUIETLY IT WAS QUITE DARK AND NO ONE SAW THEM GO OUT PLANCHET TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS MASTER AND KEPT AT A DISTANCE OF TEN PACES FROM HIM
WHILE ALL THE DEMONS OF ANGER AND JEALOUSY WERE HOWLING IN HIS HEART BUT MY GOOD GENTLEMAN RESUMED THE OLD MAN UPON WHOM THIS MUTE DESPAIR
THE BOATMAN HAD PAID MORE ATTENTION TO HER AND DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS YOUNG AND PRETTY THERE WERE THEN AS NOW A CROWD OF YOUNG AND PRETTY WOMEN WHO CAME TO SAINT CLOUD AND WHO HAD REASONS FOR NOT BEING SEEN
THIS ANIMAL WILL END BY MAKING ME AFRAID AND HE PUT HIS HORSE INTO A TROT PLANCHET FOLLOWED THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS MASTER AS IF HE HAD BEEN HIS SHADOW AND WAS SOON TROTTING BY HIS SIDE ARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS PACE ALL NIGHT
THEN D'ARTAGNAN CEASED KNOCKING AND PRAYED WITH AN ACCENT SO FULL OF ANXIETY AND PROMISES TERROR AND CAJOLERY THAT HIS VOICE WAS OF A NATURE TO REASSURE THE MOST FEARFUL AT LENGTH AN OLD WORM EATEN SHUTTER WAS OPENED OR RATHER PUSHED AJAR
HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE LITTLE PAVILION SITUATED AT THE ANGLE OF THE WALL OF WHICH ALL THE WINDOWS WERE CLOSED WITH SHUTTERS EXCEPT ONE ON THE FIRST STORY THROUGH THIS WINDOW SHONE A MILD LIGHT
IT WAS SITUATED IN A VERY PRIVATE SPOT A HIGH WALL AT THE ANGLE OF WHICH WAS THE PAVILION RAN ALONG ONE SIDE OF THIS LANE AND ON THE OTHER WAS A LITTLE GARDEN CONNECTED WITH A POOR COTTAGE
WHICH SILVERED THE FOLIAGE OF TWO OR THREE LINDEN TREES WHICH FORMED A GROUP OUTSIDE THE PARK THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT BEHIND THIS LITTLE WINDOW WHICH THREW FORTH SUCH FRIENDLY BEAMS
AND CRIES TO US SO AS TO BE UNDERSTOOD UNMISTAKABLY THAT SOME GREAT MISFORTUNE IS HANGING OVER US THEN D'ARTAGNAN BECAME ALMOST WILD HE RAN ALONG THE HIGH ROAD TOOK THE PATH HE HAD BEFORE TAKEN AND REACHING THE FERRY
THE LACKEY HELD THE SADDLEHORSES ALL AT ONCE GREAT CRIES RESOUNDED IN THE PAVILION AND A WOMAN CAME TO THE WINDOW AND OPENED IT AS IF TO THROW HERSELF OUT OF IT BUT AS SOON AS SHE PERCEIVED THE OTHER TWO MEN SHE FELL BACK AND THEY WENT INTO THE CHAMBER
TEN STROKES FROM ITS SONOROUS JAWS THERE WAS SOMETHING MELANCHOLY IN THIS BRAZEN VOICE POURING OUT ITS LAMENTATIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BUT EACH OF THOSE STROKES WHICH MADE UP THE EXPECTED HOUR VIBRATED HARMONIOUSLY TO THE HEART OF THE YOUNG MAN
HE GAINED THE PLACE APPOINTED AND AS NO SIGNAL HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM BY WHICH TO ANNOUNCE HIS PRESENCE HE WAITED NOT THE LEAST NOISE WAS TO BE HEARD IT MIGHT BE IMAGINED THAT HE WAS A HUNDRED MILES FROM THE CAPITAL D'ARTAGNAN LEANED AGAINST THE HEDGE
AT NINE O'CLOCK D'ARTAGNAN WAS AT THE HOTEL DES GARDES HE FOUND PLANCHET ALL READY THE FOURTH HORSE HAD ARRIVED PLANCHET WAS ARMED WITH HIS MUSKETOON AND A PISTOL D'ARTAGNAN HAD HIS SWORD AND PLACED TWO PISTOLS IN HIS BELT
BECAUSE WE DARE NOT SPEAK ALOUD IN ONE OR THE OTHER BUT WHY DID YOU NOT DARE TO SPEAK ALOUD PLANCHET BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID AFRAID OF BEING HEARD YES MONSIEUR AFRAID OF BEING HEARD
AT THE SIXTH HE BEGAN TO REFLECT THAT THE SEARCH WAS RATHER DUBIOUS D'ARTAGNAN HAD APPOINTED SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FOR HIS LACKEY AND WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE HE WAS RIGHT BESIDES
THE CARRIAGE WENT OFF AT A QUICK PACE ESCORTED BY THE THREE HORSEMEN AND ALL WAS OVER FROM THAT MOMENT I HAVE NEITHER SEEN NOR HEARD ANYTHING D'ARTAGNAN ENTIRELY OVERCOME BY THIS TERRIBLE STORY REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND MUTE
AND THAT HE SHOULD FIND HER NEXT DAY AT THE LOUVRE SOMETIMES HE FEARED SHE HAD HAD AN INTRIGUE WITH ANOTHER WHO IN A JEALOUS FIT HAD SURPRISED HER AND CARRIED HER OFF HIS MIND WAS TORN BY DOUBT GRIEF AND DESPAIR
WAS IN A MISERABLE LANE OF HOVELS
AMORY WENT SEVERAL TIMES TO SPEND WEEK ENDS WITH MONSIGNOR ONCE HE TOOK BURNE WITH GREAT SUCCESS FOR HE TOOK EQUAL PRIDE AND DELIGHT IN DISPLAYING THEM TO EACH OTHER MONSIGNOR TOOK HIM SEVERAL TIMES TO SEE THORNTON HANCOCK
AMORY SIGHED AND DECIDED TO GO AS A FAVOR CLARA SHE WAS IMMEMORIAL
ONE SIX O'CLOCK NOT A BIT SHE ANSWERED
MAYBE SHE ANSWERED BUT I THINK NOT I'M NEVER REALLY WILD AND NEVER HAVE BEEN THAT LITTLE OUTBURST WAS PURE SPRING AND YOU ARE TOO SAID HE
AND ONE OF THE FEW GOOD PEOPLE WHO EVER INTERESTED HIM SHE MADE HER GOODNESS SUCH AN ASSET AMORY HAD DECIDED THAT MOST GOOD PEOPLE EITHER DRAGGED THEIRS AFTER THEM AS A LIABILITY OR ELSE DISTORTED IT TO
I'M GOING TO THE COUNTRY FOR TO MORROW SHE ANNOUNCED AS SHE STOOD PANTING SAFE BEYOND THE FLARE OF THE CORNER LAMP POST
IT'S UNFORTUNATE IF I HAPPEN TO LOOK LIKE WHAT PLEASED SOME SOPPY OLD GREEK SCULPTOR BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY FACE I'D BE A QUIET NUN IN THE CONVENT WITHOUT
WHAT A TWIST CLARA HAD TO HER MIND SHE COULD MAKE FASCINATING AND ALMOST BRILLIANT CONVERSATION OUT OF THE THINNEST AIR THAT EVER FLOATED THROUGH A DRAWING ROOM
FIRST ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS AM I PAINFULLY CONCEITED WELL NO YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS VANITY BUT IT'LL AMUSE THE PEOPLE WHO NOTICE ITS PREPONDERANCE I SEE
SMILING A REPERTOIRE WHILE THE POOR PLAY REACHED ME AS A FAINT RIPPLE REACHES SHORE YAWNING AND WONDERING AN EVENING THROUGH I WATCH ALONE AND CHATTERINGS OF COURSE SPOIL THE ONE SCENE WHICH
THEY WERE WALKING ALONG NOW NO YOU'RE WRONG AGAIN HOW CAN A PERSON OF YOUR OWN SELF REPUTED BRAINS BE SO CONSTANTLY WRONG ABOUT ME I'M THE OPPOSITE OF EVERYTHING SPRING EVER STOOD FOR
YOUTH WAS STIRRING AND SHAKING OUT A FEW NEW FEATHERS HE HAD EVEN STORED ENOUGH SURPLUS ENERGY TO SALLY INTO A NEW POSE WHAT'S THE IDEA OF ALL THIS DISTRACTED STUFF AMORY ASKED ALEC ONE DAY
THAT IT BROUGHT A PICTURE OF CLARA TO HIS MIND OF CLARA ON SUCH A COOL GRAY DAY WITH HER KEEN BLUE EYES STARING OUT TRYING TO SEE HER TRAGEDIES COME MARCHING OVER THE GARDENS OUTSIDE HE ENVIED THAT POEM
WHY WELL WE HAVE SOME QUALITIES IN COMMON THINGS THAT ARE SPONTANEOUS IN EACH OF US OR WERE ORIGINALLY
I DIDN'T FEEL AS THOUGH I WERE SPEAKING ALOUD BUT I LOVE YOU OR ADORE YOU OR WORSHIP YOU THERE YOU GO RUNNING THROUGH YOUR CATALOGUE OF EMOTIONS IN FIVE SECONDS HE SMILED UNWILLINGLY
AND THE JOY OF YOUTH FILLED HIS SOUL SO THAT HE FELT HE MUST SPEAK I THINK HE SAID AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED THAT IF I LOST FAITH IN YOU I'D
AND ARE TRYING TO LIVE UP TO THEM FOR INSTANCE YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING THAT YOU ARE A SLAVE TO HIGH BALLS BUT I AM POTENTIALLY
BEEN IN HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY FOR YEARS AN ELDERLY AUNT WHO OBJECTED TO HAVING IT SOLD HAD PUT TEN YEARS TAXES WITH A LAWYER AND PRANCED OFF TO HONOLULU LEAVING CLARA TO STRUGGLE WITH THE HEATING PROBLEM AS BEST SHE COULD
APART FROM THE DULL LITERATURE OF FEMALE VIRTUE SORROW LAY LIGHTLY AROUND HER AND WHEN AMORY FOUND HER IN PHILADELPHIA HE THOUGHT HER STEELY BLUE EYES HELD ONLY HAPPINESS A LATENT STRENGTH
TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF AND SHE GAVE THE ANSWER THAT ADAM MUST HAVE GIVEN THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL BUT EVENTUALLY
GEE GIRLS AIN'T SHE SOME KID AND CLARA BEAMED ON ALL ALIKE AMORY BELIEVED THAT TRADESPEOPLE GAVE HER DISCOUNTS SOMETIMES TO HER KNOWLEDGE AND SOMETIMES WITHOUT IT HE KNEW SHE DRESSED VERY WELL
AND ALSO FOR BEHIND ALL DOORS AND THE BED AMORY SUGGESTED OH AMORY NO CRIED ALEC IN HORROR THAT ISN'T THE WAY
WELL THEN DON'T SPOIL IT IF I ENJOY GOING AROUND TELLING PEOPLE GUILELESSLY THAT I THINK I'M A GENIUS LET ME DO IT YOU'RE GETTING A REPUTATION FOR BEING ECCENTRIC SAID ALEC LAUGHING IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN
DO YOU KNOW IT RAN THAT YOUR THIRD COUSIN CLARA PAGE WIDOWED SIX MONTHS AND VERY POOR IS LIVING IN PHILADELPHIA I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER MET HER BUT I WISH AS A FAVOR TO ME YOU'D GO TO SEE HER
FOR IN HIS DREAM SHE HAD BEEN A SILLY FLAXEN CLARA
BUT THAT NIGHT SEEMED A NIGHT OF STARS AND SINGING AND CLARA'S BRIGHT SOUL STILL GLEAMED ON THE WAYS THEY HAD TROD GOLDEN GOLDEN IS THE AIR HE CHANTED TO THE LITTLE POOLS OF WATER
ARTIFICIAL GENIALITY AND OF COURSE THERE WERE THE EVER PRESENT PRIG AND PHARISEE BUT AMORY NEVER INCLUDED THEM AS BEING AMONG THE SAVED SAINT CECILIA
YOU NEVER DECIDE AT FIRST WHILE THE MERITS OF GOING OR STAYING ARE FAIRLY CLEAR IN YOUR MIND
DON'T MAKE ME OUT SUCH A LIGHT WEIGHT CLARA YOU ARE DEPRESSING SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT A LIGHT WEIGHT OF ALL THINGS SHE SAID INTENTLY TAKING HIS ARM AND OPENING WIDE HER EYES
AIN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL ENTER A FLOOR WALKER SILENCE TILL HE MOVES FORWARD SMIRKING SOCIETY PERSON AIN'T SHE YEAH BUT POOR NOW I GUESS SO THEY SAY
MY DEAR BOY THERE'S YOUR BIG MISTAKE THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WILL POWER
THINKS UP A MILLION REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD STAY SO YOUR DECISION WHEN IT COMES ISN'T TRUE IT'S BIASSED YES OBJECTED AMORY BUT ISN'T IT LACK OF WILL POWER TO LET MY IMAGINATION SHINNY ON THE WRONG SIDE
AND A SAD AMELIA LIKE LOOK GREETED HIM INSTEAD AMORY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT FROM HIS RECEPTION THAT SHE HAD NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD A CALM VIRILITY AND A DREAMY HUMOR
AMORY BEGAN ALEC WAVED HIM INTO SILENCE OF COURSE YOU NEVER LOOK YOU STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AND BEFORE HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO MAKE A SUDDEN LEAP FOR THE BED NEVER WALK NEAR THE BED
AND TALKED NONSENSE OR ROMANCE TO HER
WHAT YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE WITH ME YOU NEVER WANTED TO MARRY ME DID YOU
SAY ALEC WHAT DOES IT BOTHER YOU DOES WHAT BOTHER ME MY ACTING DAZED AND ALL THAT WHY
TELL THAT TO SOMEBODY ELSE SCOFFED AMORY YOU KNOW YOU'RE PERFECTLY EFFULGENT HE ASKED HER THE ONE THING THAT HE KNEW MIGHT EMBARRASS HER IT WAS THE REMARK
ADAM PROBABLY TOLD THE BORE ALL THE THINGS HE THOUGHT ABOUT AT NIGHT WHEN THE LOCUSTS SANG IN THE SANDY GRASS AND HE MUST HAVE REMARKED PATRONIZINGLY
ALWAYS ALWAYS RUN THE STICK IN VICIOUSLY FIRST
FORGETTING HOW DIFFERENT SHE WAS FROM HIM AT ANY RATE CLARA TOLD AMORY MUCH ABOUT HERSELF THAT EVENING SHE HAD HAD A HARRIED LIFE FROM SIXTEEN ON AND HER EDUCATION HAD STOPPED SHARPLY WITH HER LEISURE
AND REST THEIR TIRED MINDS AS AT AN ABSORBING PLAY NOBODY SEEMS TO BORE YOU HE OBJECTED ABOUT HALF THE WORLD DO SHE ADMITTED
RATHER EMBARRASSED HIM WHEN SHE TRIED TO READ NEW INTERESTS INTO HIM FOR THE BENEFIT OF WHAT OTHER ADORERS WERE PRESENT HE FELT AS IF A POLITE BUT INSISTENT STAGE MANAGER WERE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE HIM GIVE A NEW INTERPRETATION OF A PART HE HAD CONNED FOR YEARS
HIS POOR MISTREATED WILL THAT HE HAD BEEN HOLDING UP TO THE SCORN OF HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS STOOD BEFORE HIM INNOCENT AND HIS JUDGMENT WALKED OFF TO PRISON WITH THE UNCONFINABLE IMP IMAGINATION
GOLDEN IS THE AIR GOLDEN NOTES FROM GOLDEN MANDOLINS GOLDEN FRETS OF GOLDEN VIOLINS FAIR OH WEARILY FAIR SKEINS FROM BRAIDED BASKET MORTALS MAY NOT HOLD
WILD EYED GRAD STUDENTS PRECEPTORS WITH STRANGE THEORIES OF GOD AND GOVERNMENT TO THE CYNICAL AMAZEMENT OF THE SUPERCILIOUS COTTAGE CLUB AS FEBRUARY BECAME SLASHED BY SUN AND MOVED CHEERFULLY INTO MARCH
OH CLARA AMORY SAID
GIVE ME A CIGARETTE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ME SMOKE HAVE YOU WELL I DO ABOUT ONCE A MONTH AND THEN THAT WONDERFUL GIRL AND AMORY RACED TO THE CORNER LIKE TWO MAD CHILDREN GONE WILD WITH PALE BLUE TWILIGHT
THOUGH SHE WAS WISE ENOUGH NEVER TO STULTIFY HERSELF WITH SUCH HOUSEHOLD ARTS AS KNITTING AND EMBROIDERY YET IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD PICK UP A BOOK AND LET HER IMAGINATION ROVE AS A FORMLESS CLOUD WITH THE WIND
A REALISM WAS BROUGHT TO ITS FULLEST DEVELOPMENT BY THE FACTS THAT SHE WAS COMPELLED TO FACE SHE WAS ALONE IN THE WORLD WITH TWO SMALL CHILDREN LITTLE MONEY AND WORST OF ALL A HOST OF FRIENDS
HE ARRIVED IN PHILADELPHIA EXPECTING TO BE TOLD THAT
AMORY FINALLY PREVAILED AND ALEC AGREED TO ACCEPT HIS FACE VALUE IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS IF HE WAS ALLOWED REST PERIODS WHEN THEY WERE ALONE SO AMORY RAN IT OUT AT A GREAT RATE BRINGING THE MOST ECCENTRIC CHARACTERS TO DINNER
NOT A BIT OF WILL I'M A SLAVE TO MY EMOTIONS TO MY LIKES TO MY HATRED OF BOREDOM TO MOST OF MY DESIRES YOU ARE NOT SHE BROUGHT ONE LITTLE FIST DOWN ONTO THE OTHER
BUT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM THEY COULD MAKE THEM SOUND LIKE NOTHING WHATEVER THEY GAVE HER A SORT OF INNOCENT ATTENTION AND THE BEST SMILES MANY OF THEM HAD SMILED FOR LONG THERE WERE FEW TEARS IN CLARA BUT PEOPLE SMILED MISTY EYED AT HER
OH DON'T STALL PLEASE CLARA AMORY INTERRUPTED BUT DO TALK ABOUT ME A LITTLE WON'T YOU SURELY I'D ADORE TO SHE DIDN'T SMILE THAT'S SWEET OF YOU
A LIGHT WEIGHT IS AN ETERNAL NAY THERE'S SO MUCH SPRING IN THE AIR THERE'S SO MUCH LAZY SWEETNESS IN YOUR HEART SHE DROPPED HIS ARM YOU'RE ALL FINE NOW AND I FEEL GLORIOUS
AND I LOVE YOU ANY LATENT GREATNESS THAT I'VE GOT IS OH I CAN'T TALK BUT CLARA IF I COME BACK IN TWO YEARS IN A POSITION TO MARRY YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NO SHE SAID I'D NEVER MARRY AGAIN
YOU LACK JUDGMENT THE JUDGMENT TO DECIDE AT ONCE WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR IMAGINATION WILL PLAY YOU FALSE GIVEN HALF A CHANCE WELL I'LL BE DARNED EXCLAIMED AMORY IN SURPRISE THAT'S THE LAST THING I EXPECTED
BUT CLARA TALKING CLARA TELLING A SLENDER TALE OF A HATPIN AND AN INEBRIATED MAN AND HERSELF
OH DON'T TRY TO ACT BURNE THE MYSTIC TO ME AMORY LOOKED UP INNOCENTLY WHAT WHAT MIMICKED ALEC ARE YOU TRYING TO READ YOURSELF INTO A RHAPSODY WITH LET'S SEE THE BOOK
I'VE GOT MY TWO CHILDREN AND I WANT MYSELF FOR THEM I LIKE YOU I LIKE ALL CLEVER MEN YOU MORE THAN ANY BUT YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT I'D NEVER MARRY A CLEVER MAN SHE BROKE OFF SUDDENLY AMORY
QUAINT AND MEDITATIVE CHARM METAMORPHOSED THE STRAY TELEGRAPH BOY INTO A PUCK LIKE CREATURE OF DELIGHTFUL ORIGINALITY AT FIRST THIS QUALITY OF HERS SOMEHOW IRRITATED AMORY HE CONSIDERED HIS OWN UNIQUENESS SUFFICIENT AND IT
HAS NOT YET ENTERED THE PARK WHICH IS A PITY ON SOME ACCOUNTS SUNDAY PULLED THROUGH MONDAY
WEDNESDAY BUILT ME A SHELTER AGAINST THE RAIN BUT COULD NOT HAVE IT TO MYSELF IN PEACE THE NEW CREATURE INTRUDED WHEN I TRIED TO PUT IT OUT IT SHED WATER OUT OF THE HOLES IT LOOKS WITH AND
THE SORT OF TEETH THEY WEAR WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY WERE INTENDED TO EAT EACH OTHER THIS IS FOOLISH BECAUSE TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO KILL EACH OTHER AND THAT WOULD INTRODUCE WHAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS CALLED DEATH AND DEATH
I SHOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE THAT VOICE FALL SILENT AND PASS OUT OF MY LIFE BLESSED BE THE CHESTNUT THAT BROUGHT US NEAR TOGETHER AND TAUGHT ME TO KNOW THE GOODNESS OF HER HEART
SHE COULD SAVE THE SICK BUZZARD AND FURNISH FRESH MEAT TO THE DESPONDENT LIONS AND TIGERS I ADVISED HER TO KEEP AWAY FROM THE TREE SHE SAID SHE WOULDN'T
THAT IS WHAT SHE THINKS BUT THIS IS AN ERROR IN MY JUDGMENT THE DIFFERENCE IN SIZE WARRANTS THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS A DIFFERENT AND NEW KIND OF ANIMAL A FISH PERHAPS
BY MARK TWAIN NOTE I TRANSLATED A PORTION OF THIS DIARY SOME YEARS AGO AND A FRIEND OF MINE PRINTED A FEW COPIES IN AN INCOMPLETE FORM BUT THE PUBLIC NEVER GOT THEM
AND THIS NEW SOUND IS SO CLOSE TO ME IT IS RIGHT AT MY SHOULDER RIGHT AT MY EAR FIRST ON ONE SIDE AND THEN ON THE OTHER AND I AM USED ONLY TO SOUNDS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS DISTANT FROM ME FRIDAY
SHE HAS SUCH A RAGE FOR EXPLAINING FRIDAY
WE CANNOT OVERTURN THE WHOLE SCHEME TO ACCOMMODATE THE BUZZARD SATURDAY SHE FELL IN THE POND YESTERDAY WHEN SHE WAS LOOKING AT HERSELF IN IT
I AM NOT USED TO COMPANY I WISH IT WOULD STAY WITH THE OTHER ANIMALS CLOUDY TO DAY WIND IN THE EAST THINK WE SHALL HAVE RAIN WHERE DID I GET THAT WORD I REMEMBER NOW
SHE IS DETERMINED TO RUN US INTO ALL SORTS OF FOOLISH RISKS I THINK SHE WAS NOT LIKE THIS BEFORE SHE LOST HER MIND A FORTNIGHT LATER I EXAMINED ITS MOUTH THERE IS NO DANGER YET
AND HAVING THE IMITATIVE FACULTY IN A HIGHLY DEVELOPED DEGREE I SHALL BE ASTONISHED IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE A NEW KIND OF PARROT
BUT SHE HUNTED ME OUT BY MEANS OF A BEAST WHICH SHE HAS TAMED AND CALLS A WOLF AND CAME MAKING THAT PITIFUL NOISE AGAIN AND SHEDDING THAT WATER OUT OF THE PLACES SHE LOOKS WITH
FOR A BEAR DOES NOT NEED A TAIL IN ORDER TO BE DANGEROUS FOUR MONTHS LATER
WHY I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW SAYS IT LOOKS LIKE NIAGARA FALLS THAT IS NOT A REASON IT IS MERE WAYWARDNESS AND IMBECILITY I GET NO CHANCE TO NAME ANYTHING MYSELF
BUT WILL PRESENTLY EMIGRATE AGAIN WHEN OCCASION OFFERS SHE ENGAGES HERSELF IN MANY FOOLISH THINGS AMONG OTHERS TRYING TO STUDY OUT WHY THE ANIMALS CALLED LIONS AND TIGERS LIVE ON GRASS AND FLOWERS WHEN AS SHE SAYS
AND SAYS THE RESULT WILL BE A GREAT AND FINE AND NOBLE EDUCATION I TOLD HER THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER RESULT TOO IT WOULD INTRODUCE DEATH INTO THE WORLD THAT WAS A MISTAKE IT HAD BEEN BETTER TO KEEP THE REMARK TO MYSELF IT ONLY GAVE HER AN IDEA
SHE SAYS THEY WERE ONLY MADE FOR SCENERY LIKE THE RHINOCEROS AND THE MASTODON I WENT OVER THE FALLS IN A BARREL NOT SATISFACTORY TO HER WENT OVER IN A TUB STILL NOT SATISFACTORY
I AM LIKE TO LOSE MY MIND OVER THE CAPRICIOUS AND HARASSING DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS UNCLASSIFIABLE ZOOLOGICAL FREAK IF I COULD CATCH ANOTHER ONE BUT THAT IS HOPELESS IT IS A NEW VARIETY AND THE ONLY SAMPLE THIS IS PLAIN
THE OTHER ANIMALS ARE GLAD FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS EXPERIMENTING WITH THEM AND BOTHERING THEM AND I AM GLAD BECAUSE THE SNAKE TALKS AND THIS ENABLES ME TO GET A REST FRIDAY SHE SAYS THE SNAKE ADVISES HER TO TRY THE FRUIT OF THAT TREE
THE NEW CREATURE USES IT TUESDAY BEEN EXAMINING THE GREAT WATERFALL IT IS THE FINEST THING ON THE ESTATE I THINK THE NEW CREATURE CALLS IT NIAGARA FALLS
WE AGAIN THAT IS ITS WORD MINE TOO NOW FROM HEARING IT SO MUCH GOOD DEAL OF FOG THIS MORNING I DO NOT GO OUT IN THE FOG MYSELF THE NEW CREATURE DOES
A BRIGHT THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY HEAD AND I LET IT FLY SAYING IT WOULD BE A DEAL MORE WONDERFUL TO SEE IT TUMBLE UP THERE AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO KILL MYSELF WITH LAUGHING AT IT
WIPED IT AWAY WITH THE BACK OF ITS PAWS AND MADE A NOISE SUCH AS SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS MAKE WHEN THEY ARE IN DISTRESS I WISH IT WOULD NOT TALK IT IS ALWAYS TALKING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A CHEAP FLING AT THE POOR CREATURE A SLUR BUT I DO NOT MEAN IT SO
OH WOULD THAT I HAD NEVER HAD THAT RADIANT THOUGHT NEXT YEAR WE HAVE NAMED IT CAIN SHE CAUGHT IT WHILE I WAS UP COUNTRY TRAPPING ON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE ERIE
AND MADE HER UNREASONABLE ABOUT EXPERIMENTS
THE NEW CREATURE NAMES EVERYTHING THAT COMES ALONG BEFORE I CAN GET IN A PROTEST AND ALWAYS THAT SAME PRETEXT IS OFFERED IT LOOKS LIKE THE THING THERE IS THE DODO FOR INSTANCE SAYS THE MOMENT ONE LOOKS AT IT ONE SEES AT A GLANCE THAT IT
I STILL THINK IT IS A FISH BUT SHE IS INDIFFERENT ABOUT WHAT IT IS AND WILL NOT LET ME HAVE IT TO TRY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS
AMONG FRIENDS BUT IT WAS A MISTAKE
IN FACT I WAS NOT SORRY SHE CAME FOR THERE ARE BUT MEAGRE PICKINGS HERE AND SHE BROUGHT SOME OF THOSE APPLES
EXTRACTS FROM ADAM'S DIARY
I ESCAPED THAT NIGHT AND RODE A HORSE ALL NIGHT AS FAST AS HE COULD GO HOPING TO GET CLEAR OUT OF THE PARK AND HIDE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY BEFORE THE TROUBLE SHOULD BEGIN BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE
THREE MONTHS LATER THE KANGAROO STILL CONTINUES TO GROW WHICH IS VERY STRANGE AND PERPLEXING I NEVER KNEW ONE TO BE SO LONG GETTING ITS GROWTH IT HAS FUR ON ITS HEAD NOW NOT LIKE KANGAROO FUR BUT EXACTLY LIKE OUR HAIR
THE NEW CREATURE SAYS IT IS ALL WOODS AND ROCKS AND SCENERY AND THEREFORE HAS NO RESEMBLANCE TO A GARDEN SAYS IT LOOKS LIKE A PARK AND DOES NOT LOOK LIKE ANYTHING BUT A PARK CONSEQUENTLY WITHOUT CONSULTING ME
SHE SAYS THIS PARK WOULD MAKE A TIDY SUMMER RESORT IF THERE WAS ANY CUSTOM FOR IT SUMMER RESORT ANOTHER INVENTION OF HERS JUST WORDS WITHOUT ANY MEANING WHAT IS A SUMMER RESORT
THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS TRUE BUT STYLISH AND THAT IS THE MAIN POINT ABOUT CLOTHES I FIND SHE IS A GOOD DEAL OF A COMPANION I SEE I SHOULD BE LONESOME AND DEPRESSED WITHOUT HER NOW THAT I HAVE LOST MY PROPERTY
MONDAY THIS NEW CREATURE WITH THE LONG HAIR IS A GOOD DEAL IN THE WAY IT IS ALWAYS HANGING AROUND AND FOLLOWING ME ABOUT I DON'T LIKE THIS
HER MIND IS DISORDERED EVERYTHING SHOWS IT SOMETIMES SHE CARRIES THE FISH IN HER ARMS HALF THE NIGHT WHEN IT COMPLAINS AND WANTS TO GET TO THE WATER AT SUCH TIMES THE WATER COMES OUT OF THE PLACES IN HER FACE THAT SHE LOOKS OUT OF AND SHE PATS THE FISH ON THE BACK AND MAKES SOFT SOUNDS WITH HER MOUTH TO SOOTHE IT
FOR BEARS GET THEIR GROWTH EARLIER THAN THIS BEARS ARE DANGEROUS SINCE OUR CATASTROPHE
THERE SHE SAID WITH TRIUMPH THAT IS JUST IT THE SERPENT MENTIONED THAT VERY JEST AND CALLED IT THE FIRST CHESTNUT AND SAID IT WAS COEVAL WITH THE CREATION ALAS I AM INDEED TO BLAME WOULD THAT I WERE NOT WITTY
WHICH I DIDN'T BUT WENT AWAY IN MUCH HASTE I FOUND THIS PLACE OUTSIDE THE PARK AND WAS FAIRLY COMFORTABLE FOR A FEW DAYS BUT SHE HAS FOUND ME OUT FOUND ME OUT AND HAS NAMED THE PLACE TONAWANDA SAYS IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
SHE NEARLY STRANGLED AND SAID IT WAS MOST UNCOMFORTABLE THIS MADE HER SORRY FOR THE CREATURES WHICH LIVE IN THERE WHICH SHE CALLS FISH FOR SHE CONTINUES TO FASTEN NAMES ON TO THINGS THAT DON'T NEED THEM AND DON'T COME WHEN THEY ARE CALLED BY THEM
WAS A FIGURATIVE TERM MEANING AN AGED AND MOULDY JOKE I TURNED PALE AT THAT FOR I HAVE MADE MANY JOKES TO PASS THE WEARY TIME AND SOME OF THEM COULD HAVE BEEN OF THAT SORT THOUGH I HAD HONESTLY SUPPOSED THAT THEY WERE NEW WHEN I MADE THEM
I HAVE NEVER HEARD THE HUMAN VOICE BEFORE AND ANY NEW AND STRANGE SOUND INTRUDING ITSELF HERE UPON THE SOLEMN HUSH OF THESE DREAMING SOLITUDES OFFENDS MY EAR AND SEEMS A FALSE NOTE
IT GOES OUT IN ALL WEATHERS AND STUMPS RIGHT IN WITH ITS MUDDY FEET
WHAT HARM DOES IT DO SAYS IT MAKES HER SHUDDER I WONDER WHY I HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT ALWAYS LIKED THE PLUNGE AND THE EXCITEMENT AND THE COOLNESS I SUPPOSED IT WAS WHAT THE FALLS WERE FOR THEY HAVE NO OTHER USE THAT I CAN SEE
TEN YEARS LATER THEY ARE BOYS WE FOUND IT OUT LONG AGO
SATURDAY I ESCAPED LAST TUESDAY NIGHT AND TRAVELLED TWO DAYS AND BUILT ME ANOTHER SHELTER IN A SECLUDED PLACE AND OBLITERATED MY TRACKS AS WELL AS I COULD
NEXT DAY
WITH APPARENT SINCERITY AND TRUTH THAT THE SERPENT ASSURED HER THAT THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT WAS NOT APPLES IT WAS CHESTNUTS I SAID I WAS INNOCENT THEN FOR I HAD NOT EATEN ANY CHESTNUTS SHE SAID THE SERPENT INFORMED HER THAT CHESTNUT
SO I HAVE RELINQUISHED THE IDEA THOUGH I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE IT WOULD BE AN IRREPARABLE LOSS TO SCIENCE IF THEY SHOULD GET AWAY THE OLD ONE IS TAMER THAN IT WAS AND CAN LAUGH AND TALK LIKE THE PARROT HAVING LEARNED THIS NO DOUBT FROM BEING WITH THE PARROT SO MUCH
I WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT I HAD MADE ONE TO MYSELF THOUGH NOT ALOUD IT WAS THIS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE FALLS AND I SAID TO MYSELF HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO SEE THAT VAST BODY OF WATER TUMBLE DOWN THERE THEN IN AN INSTANT
SUNDAY PULLED THROUGH THIS DAY IS GETTING TO BE MORE AND MORE TRYING IT WAS SELECTED AND SET APART LAST NOVEMBER AS A DAY OF REST I ALREADY HAD SIX OF THEM PER WEEK BEFORE
I SAID IT WAS SUPERFLUOUS THEN THE WORD EVIDENTLY RAISED ME IN ITS RESPECT AND INDEED IT IS A LARGE GOOD WORD AND WILL BEAR REPETITION
IT HAS ONLY ONE TOOTH IT HAS NO TAIL YET IT MAKES MORE NOISE NOW THAN IT EVER DID BEFORE AND MAINLY AT NIGHT I HAVE MOVED OUT
SINCE THEN I HAVE DECIPHERED SOME MORE OF ADAM'S HIEROGLYPHICS AND THINK HE HAS NOW BECOME SUFFICIENTLY IMPORTANT AS A PUBLIC CHARACTER TO JUSTIFY THIS PUBLICATION M T
IT IS NOT A KANGAROO NO FOR IT SUPPORTS ITSELF BY HOLDING TO HER FINGER AND THUS GOES A FEW STEPS ON ITS HIND LEGS AND THEN FALLS DOWN IT IS PROBABLY SOME KIND OF A BEAR AND YET IT HAS NO TAIL AS YET AND NO FUR EXCEPT ON ITS HEAD
LOOKS LIKE A DODO IT WILL HAVE TO KEEP THAT NAME NO DOUBT IT WEARIES ME TO FRET ABOUT IT AND IT DOES NO GOOD ANYWAY DODO IT LOOKS NO MORE LIKE A DODO THAN I DO
AND EVERY BEAST WAS DESTROYING ITS NEIGHBOR I KNEW WHAT IT MEANT EVE HAD EATEN THAT FRUIT AND DEATH WAS COME INTO THE WORLD THE TIGERS ATE MY HORSE PAYING NO ATTENTION WHEN I ORDERED THEM TO DESIST
BUT I CAUGHT A TRUE KANGAROO AND BROUGHT IT IN THINKING THAT THIS ONE BEING LONESOME WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT FOR COMPANY THAN HAVE NO KIN AT ALL
WHEN NIGHT COMES I SHALL THROW THEM OUT DOORS I WILL NOT SLEEP WITH THEM AGAIN FOR I FIND THEM CLAMMY AND UNPLEASANT TO LIE AMONG WHEN A PERSON HASN'T ANYTHING ON SUNDAY PULLED THROUGH TUESDAY
ANOTHER THING SHE SAYS IT IS ORDERED THAT WE WORK FOR OUR LIVING HEREAFTER SHE WILL BE USEFUL I WILL SUPERINTEND TEN DAYS LATER SHE ACCUSES ME OF BEING THE CAUSE OF OUR DISASTER SHE SAYS
NOT BY ANY ART OR SKILL BUT BY THAT UNACCOUNTABLE LUCK THAT APPEARS TO ALWAYS WAIT UPON A BOY WHEN HE PLAYS THE WAG FROM SCHOOL AND GOES OUT FISHING ON A SUNNY AFTERNOON WITH A BIT OF STRING TIED ON TO THE END OF A TREE
FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS A THIRD MAN CAME IN AND DESCRIBED HOW HE HAD CAUGHT IT EARLY ONE MORNING WITH BLEAK AND THEN HE LEFT AND A STOLID SOLEMN LOOKING MIDDLE AGED INDIVIDUAL CAME IN
YOU WILL BE NEARLY SURE TO MEET ONE OR TWO OLD ROD MEN SIPPING THEIR TODDY THERE AND THEY WILL TELL YOU ENOUGH FISHY STORIES IN HALF AN HOUR TO GIVE YOU INDIGESTION FOR A MONTH GEORGE AND I I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HARRIS
AND GEORGE ASKED THE OLD MAN HOW MUCH HE THOUGHT IT WEIGHED EIGHTEEN POUNDS SIX OUNCES SAID OUR FRIEND RISING AND TAKING DOWN HIS COAT YES HE CONTINUED IT WUR SIXTEEN YEAR AGO COME THE THIRD O NEXT MONTH THAT I LANDED HIM
AND COMING HOME WE CALLED IN AT A LITTLE RIVER SIDE INN FOR A REST AND OTHER THINGS WE WENT INTO THE PARLOUR AND SAT DOWN THERE WAS AN OLD FELLOW THERE SMOKING A LONG CLAY PIPE AND WE NATURALLY BEGAN CHATTING
I CAUGHT HIM JUST BELOW THE BRIDGE WITH A MINNOW THEY TOLD ME HE WUR IN THE RIVER AND I SAID I'D HAVE HIM AND SO I DID YOU DON'T SEE MANY FISH THAT SIZE ABOUT HERE NOW I'M THINKING GOOD NIGHT GENTLEMEN GOOD NIGHT
LIGHTS HIS PIPE AND COMMENCES TO PUFF IN SILENCE HE LETS THE YOUNGSTERS BRAG AWAY FOR A WHILE AND THEN DURING A MOMENTARY LULL HE REMOVES THE PIPE FROM HIS MOUTH AND REMARKS AS HE KNOCKS THE ASHES OUT AGAINST THE BARS
BUT THAT AGAIN WAS AWKWARD WHEN HE HAD ONLY CAUGHT ONE OR TWO SO TO SIMPLIFY MATTERS HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO JUST DOUBLE THE QUANTITY
WE THOUGHT IT STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE THAT A STUFFED TROUT SHOULD BREAK UP INTO LITTLE PIECES LIKE THAT AND SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE IF IT HAD BEEN A STUFFED TROUT BUT IT WAS NOT
THEY SAID THEY WOULD CONSIDER THE IDEA IF THE NUMBER WERE DOUBLED AND EACH FISH COUNTED AS TWENTY IF EVER YOU HAVE AN EVENING TO SPARE UP THE RIVER I SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO DROP INTO ONE OF THE LITTLE VILLAGE INNS AND TAKE A SEAT IN THE TAP ROOM
WE SAID THAT NOBODY HAD TOLD US SO BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD DONE IT WELL IT'S A MOST REMARKABLE THING MOST REMARKABLE
A STURGEON A FORTY POUND STURGEON TAKEN ON A LINE SIR YES YOU MAY WELL LOOK SURPRISED I'LL HAVE ANOTHER THREE OF SCOTCH LANDLORD PLEASE AND THEN HE GOES ON TO TELL OF THE ASTONISHMENT OF EVERYBODY WHO SAW IT
A GOOD STATION FOR FISHING AND FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THE DISTRICT I AM QUITE PREPARED TO BEAR OUT THIS STATEMENT THERE IS NO SPOT IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN GET MORE FISHING
AND ADVISED ME TO GIVE IT UP THEY SAID THAT I WAS AN EXTREMELY NEAT THROWER AND THAT I SEEMED TO HAVE PLENTY OF GUMPTION FOR THE THING AND QUITE ENOUGH CONSTITUTIONAL LAZINESS BUT THEY WERE SURE I SHOULD NEVER MAKE ANYTHING OF A FISHERMAN
THE RIVER ABOUNDS IN PIKE ROACH DACE GUDGEON AND EELS JUST HERE AND YOU CAN SIT AND FISH FOR THEM ALL DAY SOME PEOPLE DO THEY NEVER CATCH THEM
YOU HAVEN'T INJURED THE FISH HAVE YOU I CRIED IN ALARM RUSHING UP I HOPE NOT SAID GEORGE RISING CAUTIOUSLY AND LOOKING ABOUT BUT HE HAD
SO HE HAS TO GO ON BY HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY ENCOURAGEMENT NO HE CONTINUES THOUGHTFULLY I SHOULDN'T BELIEVE IT MYSELF IF ANYBODY TOLD IT TO ME BUT IT'S A FACT FOR ALL THAT I HAD BEEN SITTING THERE ALL THE AFTERNOON AND HAD CAUGHT LITERALLY NOTHING
THE RIVER BETWEEN READING AND HENLEY WAS MUCH CLEANER AFTER WE HAD WASHED OUR CLOTHES IN IT THAN IT WAS BEFORE ALL THE DIRT CONTAINED IN THE RIVER BETWEEN READING AND HENLEY WE COLLECTED DURING THAT WASH AND WORKED IT INTO OUR CLOTHES
IN FACT AT FIRST GLANCE I THOUGHT IT WAS A COD AH SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF MY GAZE FINE FELLOW THAT AIN'T HE QUITE UNCOMMON I MURMURED
WOULD REQUIRE MORE PLAY OF FANCY MORE POWER OF INVENTION THAN I APPEARED TO POSSESS SOME PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE A GOOD FISHERMAN IS THE ABILITY TO TELL LIES EASILY AND WITHOUT BLUSHING
I'D GONE OUT PIKE FISHING BLESS YOU NEVER THINKING OF A TROUT AND WHEN I SAW THAT WHOPPER ON THE END OF MY LINE BLEST IF IT DIDN'T QUITE TAKE ME ABACK WELL YOU SEE HE WEIGHED TWENTY SIX POUND GOOD NIGHT GENTLEMEN GOOD NIGHT
LAST MONDAY I LANDED A GUDGEON WEIGHING EIGHTEEN POUNDS AND MEASURING THREE FEET FROM THE TIP TO THE TAIL THERE IS NO ART NO SKILL REQUIRED FOR THAT SORT OF THING IT SHOWS PLUCK BUT THAT IS ALL
AND OUT HE WENT AND LEFT US ALONE WE COULD NOT TAKE OUR EYES OFF THE FISH AFTER THAT IT REALLY WAS A REMARKABLY FINE FISH WE WERE STILL LOOKING AT IT WHEN THE LOCAL CARRIER WHO HAD JUST STOPPED AT THE INN
AND HOW IT HAD BROKEN HIS ROD HE SAID HE HAD WEIGHED IT CAREFULLY WHEN HE REACHED HOME AND IT HAD TURNED THE SCALE AT THIRTY FOUR POUNDS HE WENT IN HIS TURN AND WHEN HE WAS GONE THE LANDLORD CAME IN TO US
THEY COME AND STAND HALF OUT OF THE WATER WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN FOR BISCUITS AND IF YOU GO FOR A BATHE THEY CROWD ROUND AND GET IN YOUR WAY AND IRRITATE YOU BUT THEY ARE NOT TO BE HAD BY A BIT OF WORM ON THE END OF A HOOK NOR ANYTHING LIKE IT
DURING WHICH OUR EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM THEY FINALLY RESTED UPON A DUSTY OLD GLASS CASE FIXED VERY HIGH UP ABOVE THE CHIMNEY PIECE AND CONTAINING A TROUT IT RATHER FASCINATED ME THAT TROUT IT WAS SUCH A MONSTROUS FISH
SOME FISHERMEN COME HERE AND FISH FOR A DAY AND OTHERS STOP AND FISH FOR A MONTH
NO YOUR ACCOMPLISHED ANGLER WOULD SCORN TO TELL A LIE THAT WAY HIS METHOD IS A STUDY IN ITSELF HE COMES IN QUIETLY WITH HIS HAT ON APPROPRIATES THE MOST COMFORTABLE CHAIR
AND GEORGE SAID THE CROPS SEEMED TO BE COMING UP NICELY AFTER THAT IT CAME OUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER THAT WE WERE STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH A POT OF BEER IN HIS HAND AND HE ALSO LOOKED AT THE FISH GOOD SIZED TROUT THAT SAID GEORGE TURNING ROUND TO HIM AH YOU MAY WELL SAY THAT SIR REPLIED THE MAN
IT TOOK ME HALF AN HOUR HALF AN HOUR SIR TO LAND THAT FISH AND EVERY MOMENT I THOUGHT THE LINE WAS GOING TO SNAP I REACHED HIM AT LAST
BUT THIS IS A MISTAKE MERE BALD FABRICATION IS USELESS THE VERIEST TYRO CAN MANAGE THAT IT IS IN THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL DETAIL THE EMBELLISHING TOUCHES OF PROBABILITY
THEN IF BY ANY CHANCE HE REALLY DID CATCH ONE FISH HE CALLED IT TWENTY WHILE TWO FISH WOULD COUNT THIRTY THREE FORTY AND SO ON IT IS A SIMPLE AND EASILY WORKED PLAN
SO EVENTUALLY HE MADE ONE FINAL ARRANGEMENT WITH HIMSELF WHICH HE HAS RELIGIOUSLY HELD TO EVER SINCE AND THAT WAS TO COUNT EACH FISH THAT HE CAUGHT AS TEN AND TO ASSUME TEN TO BEGIN WITH FOR EXAMPLE
WE PAID THE BILL WITHOUT A MURMUR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF STREATLEY AND GORING IS A GREAT FISHING CENTRE THERE IS SOME EXCELLENT FISHING TO BE HAD HERE
AND GOT OUR CLOTHES WASHED WE HAD TRIED WASHING THEM OURSELVES IN THE RIVER UNDER GEORGE'S SUPERINTENDENCE AND IT HAD BEEN A FAILURE INDEED IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN A FAILURE
YES THEY ARE THE SORT TO GIVE IT ME TO PUT UP IN MY PARLOUR IF THEY HAD CAUGHT IT THEY ARE HA HA HA AND THEN HE TOLD US THE REAL HISTORY OF THE FISH IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD CAUGHT IT HIMSELF YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS QUITE A LAD
THE GREATEST NUMBER OF FISH HE EVER CAUGHT IN ONE DAY WAS THREE AND YOU CAN'T ADD TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TO THREE AT LEAST NOT IN FISH SO HE INCREASED HIS PERCENTAGE TO THIRTY THREE AND A THIRD
IT REALLY WAS A MOST ASTONISHING TROUT THE MORE WE LOOKED AT IT THE MORE WE MARVELLED AT IT IT EXCITED GEORGE SO MUCH THAT HE CLIMBED UP ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF IT AND THEN THE CHAIR SLIPPED
OH NO NOT NOW SIR IT DID USED TO KNOCK ME OVER A BIT AT FIRST BUT LOR LOVE YOU ME AND THE MISSUS WE LISTENS TO EM ALL DAY NOW IT'S WHAT YOU'RE USED TO YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT YOU'RE USED TO
AND WITHOUT EVEN A TINGE OF BITTERNESS IN HIS TONE AS HE REFILLS HIS PIPE AND REQUESTS THE LANDLORD TO BRING HIM THREE OF SCOTCH COLD THERE IS A PAUSE AFTER THIS
I HAD NOT GOT SUFFICIENT IMAGINATION THEY SAID THAT AS A POET OR A SHILLING SHOCKER OR A REPORTER OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND I MIGHT BE SATISFACTORY BUT THAT TO GAIN ANY POSITION AS A THAMES ANGLER
AND THEN HE GREW DISSATISFIED WITH IT NOBODY BELIEVED HIM WHEN HE TOLD THEM THAT HE ONLY DOUBLED AND HE THEREFORE GAINED NO CREDIT THAT WAY WHATEVER WHILE HIS MODERATION PUT HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE AMONG THE OTHER ANGLERS
BECAUSE AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT I DID CATCH IT BUT FANCY YOUR GUESSING IT LIKE THAT DEAR ME IT'S REALLY A MOST REMARKABLE THING AND THEN HE WENT ON AND TOLD US HOW IT HAD TAKEN HIM HALF AN HOUR TO LAND IT
IT WILL BE ALL THE SAME THE ANGLER'S GUIDE TO THE THAMES SAYS THAT JACK AND PERCH ARE ALSO TO BE HAD ABOUT HERE BUT THERE THE ANGLER'S GUIDE IS WRONG
WELL I HAD A HAUL ON TUESDAY EVENING THAT IT'S NOT MUCH GOOD MY TELLING ANYBODY ABOUT OH WHY'S THAT THEY ASK BECAUSE I DON'T EXPECT ANYBODY WOULD BELIEVE ME IF I DID REPLIES THE OLD FELLOW CALMLY
I NEVER KNEW ANYBODY CATCH ANYTHING UP THE THAMES EXCEPT MINNOWS AND DEAD CATS BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO OF COURSE WITH FISHING THE LOCAL FISHERMAN'S GUIDE DOESN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT CATCHING ANYTHING ALL IT SAYS IS THE PLACE IS
WHEN HE HAD REALLY CAUGHT THREE SMALL FISH AND SAID HE HAD CAUGHT SIX IT USED TO MAKE HIM QUITE JEALOUS TO HEAR A MAN WHOM HE KNEW FOR A FACT HAD ONLY CAUGHT ONE GOING ABOUT TELLING PEOPLE HE HAD LANDED TWO DOZEN
JACK AND PERCH MAY BE ABOUT THERE INDEED I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY ARE YOU CAN SEE THEM THERE IN SHOALS WHEN YOU ARE OUT FOR A WALK ALONG THE BANKS
AND WHAT HIS WIFE SAID WHEN HE GOT HOME AND OF WHAT JOE BUGGLES THOUGHT ABOUT IT I ASKED THE LANDLORD OF AN INN UP THE RIVER ONCE IF IT DID NOT INJURE HIM SOMETIMES LISTENING TO THE TALES THAT THE FISHERMEN ABOUT THERE TOLD HIM AND HE SAID
HE HAD GONE OUT AND HAD A SHAVE EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND HAD THEN COME BACK AND SPENT FULL FORTY MINUTES IN PIPECLAYING HIS SHOES WE HAD NOT SEEN HIM SINCE
AND SAT DOWN OVER BY THE WINDOW NONE OF US SPOKE FOR A WHILE BUT AT LENGTH GEORGE TURNED TO THE NEW COMER AND SAID I BEG YOUR PARDON I HOPE YOU WILL FORGIVE THE LIBERTY THAT WE PERFECT STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ARE TAKING
I KNEW A YOUNG MAN ONCE HE WAS A MOST CONSCIENTIOUS FELLOW AND WHEN HE TOOK TO FLY FISHING HE DETERMINED NEVER TO EXAGGERATE HIS HAULS BY MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE PER CENT WHEN I HAVE CAUGHT FORTY FISH SAID HE
HE TOLD US THAT IT HAD BEEN A FINE DAY TO DAY AND WE TOLD HIM THAT IT HAD BEEN A FINE DAY YESTERDAY
IF HE DID NOT CATCH ANY FISH AT ALL THEN HE SAID HE HAD CAUGHT TEN FISH YOU COULD NEVER CATCH LESS THAN TEN FISH BY HIS SYSTEM THAT WAS THE FOUNDATION OF IT
THE GENERAL AIR OF SCRUPULOUS ALMOST OF PEDANTIC VERACITY THAT THE EXPERIENCED ANGLER IS SEEN ANYBODY CAN COME IN AND SAY OH I CAUGHT FIFTEEN DOZEN PERCH YESTERDAY EVENING OR
INDEED THEY ARE WELL YOU SEE DIAMOND I DON'T WANT TO GO LAME AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WERE SO VERY LAME AFTER ALL THERE OH BUT I WAS
MAY BE ATTENDED WITH FEWER INCONVENIENCES THAN TO LEAVE THAT DISCRETION ALTOGETHER AT LARGE
IN EVERY COUNTRY IT IS A HERCULEAN TASK
MY FATHER WOULD HEAR HER COMPLAINTS TO THE END WITHOUT PUTTING IN A WORD EXCEPT IT WERE TO ASK HER A QUESTION
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO DIAMOND AND RUBY IT WAS FRIDAY NIGHT AND DIAMOND LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSEHOLD HAD HAD VERY LITTLE TO EAT THAT DAY THE MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS PAY THE WEEK'S RENT
BUT SHE WOULD PUT A SKIN OVER IT AFTER HER OWN FASHION
JOSEPH YOUR MASTER SHOULD GROW LEAN I COULD HAVE PRETENDED TO BE LAME BUT THAT NO HORSE LEAST OF ALL AN ANGEL HORSE WOULD DO SO I MUST BE LAME AND SO I SPRAINED MY ANKLE FOR THE ANGEL HORSES HAVE ANKLES
WITH A WISDOM I HAVE SINCE LEARNED TO COMPREHEND THOUGH I REMEMBER IT SHOCKED ME A LITTLE AT THE TIME ALL THIS SET ME THINKING BEFORE THE DRESSING OF LITTLE DAVIE WAS OVER I HAD MY QUESTION TO PUT TO KIRSTY IT WAS IN FACT THE SAME QUESTION
HE SAID BUT RUBY NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD OR TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HIM I SUPPOSE HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND MORE OF ENGLISH THAN JUST WHAT THE COACHMAN AND STABLEMAN WERE IN THE HABIT OF ADDRESSING HIM WITH FINDING HOWEVER THAT HIS COMPANION MADE NO REPLY
MAY SERVE AS A STANDARD THE STATE OF AGRICULTURE AND THE POPULOUSNESS OF A COUNTRY HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS NEARLY CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER AND AS A RULE FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED NUMBERS IN THE VIEW OF SIMPLICITY AND CERTAINTY ARE ENTITLED TO A PREFERENCE
CAME RUNNING IN GREAT DISTRESS TO KIRSTY CRYING FEE FEE BY WHICH HE MEANT TO INDICATE THAT A FLEA WAS RENDERING HIS LIFE MISERABLE
BUT THERE'S YOUNG DIAMOND LISTENING TO ALL WE'RE SAYING AND HE KNOWS WELL ENOUGH THERE ARE HORSES IN HEAVEN FOR ANGELS TO RIDE UPON AS WELL AS OTHER ANIMALS LIONS AND EAGLES AND BULLS IN MORE IMPORTANT SITUATIONS
WHICH WERE EVER TRYING TO GET UP A COUNTRY WHERE EVERY CLIFF AND ROCK AND WELL HAD ITS STORY
DIAMOND OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND DOWN THE STAIR AND INTO THE YARD HIS LITTLE HEART WAS IN A FLUTTER FOR HE HAD LONG GIVEN UP ALL THOUGHT OF SEEING HER AGAIN NEITHER NOW WAS HE TO SEE HER WHEN HE GOT OUT
THEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SPAKE LIKE A DISCONTENTED PROPHET OF OLD WHY DOESN'T HE GIVE THEM SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT THEN
HE SHOT HIS HEAD OVER THE PARTITION AND LOOKING DOWN AT HIM SAID YOU JUST WAIT TILL TO MORROW AND YOU'LL SEE WHETHER I'M SPEAKING THE TRUTH OR NOT I DECLARE THE OLD HORSE IS FAST ASLEEP DIAMOND NO I WON'T
DEPEND UPON IT RUBY NO CABMAN LIKES TO BE ABUSED ANY MORE THAN HIS FARE
HE WOULD ASK OUR VERSION OF THE AFFAIR AND LISTEN TO THAT AS HE HAD LISTENED TO HERS THEN HE WOULD SET FORTH TO US WHERE WE HAD BEEN WRONG IF WE WERE WRONG AND SEND US AWAY WITH AN INJUNCTION NOT TO PROVOKE MISSUS MITCHELL WHO COULDN'T HELP BEING SHORT IN HER TEMPER POOR THING
AND WENT ON BLOWING SHE WANTS ME TO GO INTO THE STABLE
UPON A PRINCIPLE WHICH DISTRIBUTES THE PUBLIC BURDENS WITH SO UNEQUAL A HAND AND WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO IMPOVERISH AND OPPRESS THE CITIZENS OF SOME STATES WHILE THOSE OF OTHERS WOULD SCARCELY BE CONSCIOUS OF THE SMALL PROPORTION OF THE WEIGHT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO SUSTAIN
DIAMOND IN CONSEQUENCE HAD GONE TO BED VERY QUIET AND THOUGHTFUL A LITTLE TROUBLED INDEED IT HAD BEEN A VERY STORMY WINTER
AND ENOUGH LIKEWISE TO SERVE AS A BACKGROUND TO MY DESCRIPTION OF KIRSTY KIRSTY WAS A HIGHLAND WOMAN WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF THE HOUSE IN WHICH THE FARM SERVANTS LIVED SHE WAS A CHEERFUL GRACIOUS KIND WOMAN A WOMAN OF GOD'S MAKING ONE WOULD SAY
THE NORTH WIND OFTEN BLEW WHEN DIAMOND WENT TO HIS BED WHICH WAS IN A TINY ROOM IN THE ROOF HE HEARD IT LIKE THE SEA MOANING AND WHEN HE FELL ASLEEP HE STILL HEARD THE MOANING ALL AT ONCE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THE LIGHT SHOWED THE WHITE MARK ON DIAMOND'S FOREHEAD BUT RUBY'S EYE SHONE SO BRIGHT THAT HE THOUGHT MORE LIGHT CAME OUT OF IT THAN WENT IN THIS IS WHAT HE SAW BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK HE HEARD
IT'S MY BELIEF ONCE OUT THEY'D STICK OUT FOR EVER TALK OF KICKING WHY DON'T YOU PUT ONE FOOT BEFORE THE OTHER NOW AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CAB THE ABUSE MASTER GETS FOR YOUR SAKE IS QUITE SHAMEFUL NO DECENT HORSE WOULD BRING IT ON HIM
WHETHER SHE WAS NICE LOOKING OR NOT
YOU GO ALONG LIKE A BUTTOCK OF BEEF UPON CASTORS YOU DO AIN'T YOU AFRAID I'LL KICK IF YOU GO ON LIKE THAT DIAMOND
THAT THEY CONTAIN IN THEIR OWN NATURE A SECURITY AGAINST EXCESS THEY PRESCRIBE THEIR OWN LIMIT WHICH CANNOT BE EXCEEDED WITHOUT DEFEATING THE END PROPOSED THAT IS AN EXTENSION OF THE REVENUE WHEN APPLIED TO THIS OBJECT
HOLD YOUR TONGUE OR I'LL BREAK MY HALTER AND BE AT YOU WITH YOUR HANDSOME FAT NEVER MIND DIAMOND YOU'RE A GOOD HORSE YOU CAN'T HURT ME CAN'T HURT YOU JUST LET ME ONCE TRY NO YOU CAN'T WHY THEN
A GREAT PUFF OF WIND CAME AGAINST HIM AND IN OBEDIENCE TO IT HE TURNED HIS BACK AND WENT AS IT BLEW
AND BE SLEEK AND FAT AS I CAN AND GO NO FASTER THAN I NEED NOW REALLY IF THE REST OF THE HORSES WEREN'T ALL ASLEEP POOR THINGS THEY WORK TILL THEY'RE TIRED
WHERE THEY FOUND A CART WAITING TO CARRY THEM AND THEIR LUGGAGE TO THE MOUND WHICH WAS THE NAME OF MISTER RAYMOND'S NEW RESIDENCE I WILL NOT DESCRIBE THE VARIED FEELINGS OF THE PARTY AS THEY WENT OR WHEN THEY ARRIVED ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT DIAMOND WHO IS MY ONLY CARE WAS FULL OF QUIET DELIGHT
AND EVERYTHING READY FOR MIGRATING AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE
REVEALED THAT IF HE WAS NOT ALREADY ASLEEP HE WAS PAST UNDERSTANDING A WORD THAT RUBY WAS SAYING WHEN YOUNG DIAMOND FOUND THIS HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT VENTURE TO TAKE UP THE DROPT SHUTTLECOCK OF THE CONVERSATION I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IT RUBY
AND HE WORKS LIKE A HORSE I DARESAY HE GRUDGES HIS MASTER THE BEER HE DRINKS
AND THE MOST OF THE WILD FLOWERS RISE EARLY TO BE BEFORE THE LEAVES BECAUSE IF THEY DID NOT
IF WE ARE UNWILLING TO IMPAIR THE FORCE OF THIS APPLAUDED PROVISION WE SHALL BE OBLIGED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE UNITED STATES AFFORD THE EXTRAORDINARY SPECTACLE OF A GOVERNMENT DESTITUTE EVEN OF THE SHADOW OF CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO ENFORCE THE EXECUTION OF ITS OWN LAWS
HAS BEEN ALREADY POINTED OUT AND HAS SUFFICIENTLY APPEARED FROM THE TRIAL WHICH HAS BEEN MADE OF IT I SPEAK OF IT NOW SOLELY WITH A VIEW TO EQUALITY AMONG THE STATES
OH SHE'S NOT A BAD SORT SAID KIRSTY THOUGH I MUST SAY IF I WAS HER I WOULD TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE AGREEABLE TO RETURN TO KIRSTY SHE WAS OUR CONSTANT RESORT
WELL I DON'T GRUDGE YOURS WHAT HE GETS BY ME SAID RUBY GETS RETORTED DIAMOND WHAT HE GETS ISN'T WORTH GRUDGING IT COMES TO NEXT TO NOTHING WHAT WITH YOUR FAT AND SHINE
THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN CONSTANT OPPOSITION FAULT FINDING AND COMPLAINT THE REAL MISTAKE WAS THAT WE WERE BOYS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER ALTOGETHER ANTAGONISTIC TO THE BOY NATURE
OTHER DEFECTS OF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HAMILTON
THE ATTEMPT THEREFORE TO REGULATE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE MEMBERS OF A CONFEDERACY BY ANY SUCH RULE CANNOT FAIL TO BE PRODUCTIVE OF GLARING INEQUALITY AND EXTREME OPPRESSION THIS INEQUALITY WOULD OF ITSELF
ONCE I AM FAT MY NATURE IS TO KEEP FAT FOR A LONG TIME AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN MASTER MIGHT COME HOME AND WANT TO SEE ME YOU CONCEITED GOOD FOR NOTHING BRUTE YOU'RE ONLY FIT FOR THE KNACKER'S YARD YOU WANTED TO LOOK HANDSOME DID YOU
AND MUST FOR A LONG TIME CONSTITUTE THE CHIEF PART OF THE REVENUE RAISED IN THIS COUNTRY THOSE OF THE DIRECT KIND WHICH PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO LAND AND BUILDINGS MAY ADMIT OF A RULE OF APPORTIONMENT EITHER THE VALUE OF LAND
SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE GOT IT INTO OUR HEADS THAT THE SHORTNESS OF HER TEMPER WAS MYSTERIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORTNESS OF HER NOSE SHE WAS SAVING EVEN TO STINGINESS SHE WOULD DO HER BEST TO PROVIDE WHAT MY FATHER LIKED
AND AS I HEAR GET ALONG NO FASTER THAN A BIG DRAY HORSE WITH TWO TONS BEHIND HIM SO THEY TELL ME YOUR MASTER'S NOT MINE SAID RUBY I MUST ATTEND TO MY OWN MASTER'S INTERESTS AND EAT ALL THAT IS GIVEN ME
A SUCCESSFUL FACTION MAY ERECT A TYRANNY ON THE RUINS OF ORDER AND LAW WHILE NO SUCCOR COULD CONSTITUTIONALLY BE AFFORDED BY THE UNION TO THE FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
ANKLE INDEED WHY SHOULD YOU APE YOUR BETTERS HORSES AIN'T GOT ANY ANKLES
FOR I WAS ALWAYS RATHER DELICATE AND IF I TOOK A DISLIKE TO ANYTHING WOULD RATHER GO WITHOUT THAN EAT OR DRINK OF IT BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU ENOUGH ABOUT HER TO MAKE IT PLAIN THAT SHE COULD BE NO FAVOURITE WITH US
AM I AWAKE OR AM I ASLEEP BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR THERE WAS NORTH WIND CALLING HIM
BUT HE HELPED HIS FATHER STILL BOTH IN THE STABLE AND THE HARNESS ROOM AND GENERALLY WENT WITH HIM ON THE BOX THAT HE MIGHT LEARN TO DRIVE A PAIR AND BE READY TO OPEN THE CARRIAGE DOOR MISTER RAYMOND ADVISED HIS FATHER TO GIVE HIM PLENTY OF LIBERTY
THE INORDINATE PRIDE OF STATE IMPORTANCE HAS SUGGESTED TO SOME MINDS AN OBJECTION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF A GUARANTY IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
BUT FOR US SHE THOUGHT ALMOST ANYTHING GOOD ENOUGH SHE WOULD FOR INSTANCE GIVE US THE THINNEST OF MILK WE SAID SHE SKIMMED IT THREE TIMES BEFORE SHE THOUGHT IT BLUE ENOUGH FOR US MY TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS DID NOT MIND IT SO MUCH AS I DID
HAVE NO POWERS TO EXACT OBEDIENCE OR PUNISH DISOBEDIENCE TO THEIR RESOLUTIONS EITHER BY PECUNIARY MULCTS
BY WHICH IT IS DECLARED THAT EACH STATE SHALL RETAIN EVERY POWER JURISDICTION AND RIGHT
IT WILL APPEAR FROM THE SPECIMENS WHICH HAVE BEEN CITED THAT THE AMERICAN CONFEDERACY IN THIS PARTICULAR STANDS DISCRIMINATED FROM EVERY OTHER INSTITUTION OF A SIMILAR KIND AND EXHIBITS A NEW AND UNEXAMPLED PHENOMENON IN THE POLITICAL WORLD
BY BEING CROSS WITH THEM THIS COMES OF NOT HAVING FAITH ENOUGH IN GOD AND SHOWS HOW NECESSARY THIS FAITH IS FOR WHEN WE LOSE IT WE LOSE EVEN THE KINDNESS WHICH ALONE CAN SOOTHE THE SUFFERING
WHAT IS IT NOW THERE'S A FRIEND OF NANNY'S A LAME BOY CALLED JIM I'VE HEARD OF HIM SAID MISTER RAYMOND WELL NANNY DOESN'T CARE MUCH ABOUT GOING TO THE COUNTRY SIR
YOU MAKE ME ASHAMED OF BEING A HORSE YOU DARE TO SAY MY MASTER AIN'T YOUR MASTER THAT'S YOUR GRATITUDE FOR THE WAY HE FEEDS YOU AND SPARES YOU PRAY WHERE WOULD YOUR CARCASS BE IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM
THERE IS DOUBTLESS A STRIKING ABSURDITY IN SUPPOSING THAT A RIGHT OF THIS KIND DOES NOT EXIST
WHERE THE WHOLE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE
HAVING MANY BLEAK MOORLAND HILLS THAT LAY ABOUT LIKE SLOW STIFFENED WAVES OF NO GREAT HEIGHT BUT OF MUCH DESOLATION AND AS FAR AS THE IMAGINATION WAS CONCERNED IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE MINDS OF FORMER GENERATIONS HAD BEEN AS BLEAK AS THE COUNTRY
A LITTLE LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE DUSTY WINDOW FROM A GAS LAMP SUFFICIENT TO SHOW HIM DIAMOND AND RUBY WITH THEIR TWO HEADS UP
TILL SOME TIME AFTER SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS TOO SHY TO GO AND INQUIRE ABOUT HER BUT WHEN AT LENGTH SHE WENT TO LIVE WITH DIAMOND'S FAMILY
HE JUMPED OUT OF BED AND LOOKED EVERYWHERE BUT COULD NOT SEE HER DIAMOND COME HERE SHE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT WHERE THE HERE WAS HE COULD NOT TELL TO BE SURE THE ROOM WAS ALL BUT QUITE DARK
IT WAS SHE WHO GAVE US SOMETHING TO EAT AS OFTEN AND AS MUCH AS WE WANTED
WHARTON KNEW THAT THEIR MISFORTUNE AS THEY BOTH TERMED THEIR DEFEAT WAS OWING TO THE OTHER'S RASHNESS BUT HE FORBORE TO SPEAK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT WHICH HAD DEPRIVED THE ENGLISH OF THEIR LEADER AND TO WHICH HE GOOD NATUREDLY ASCRIBED THEIR SUBSEQUENT DISCOMFITURE
GOD WILL REWARD YOU FOR ALL THE GOOD YOU HAVE DONE SAID MISS PEYTON MILDLY YES INTERRUPTED THE SPINSTER HASTILY AND WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE THAT WAS INSTANTLY SUCCEEDED BY AN EXPRESSION THAT DENOTED MORE OF WORLDLY CARE
HER EYES WERE UNIFORMLY FASTENED ON THE POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS SUDDENLY LOST BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HILL AND AT EACH TURN AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF THE SPOT SHE LINGERED UNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER SISTER QUICKENED HER PACE TO AN EVEN MOTION WITH THAT OF HER OWN
TO HIS GREAT JOY HIS MAN PRONOUNCED THE STEED TO BE EQUALLY CONVALESCENT WITH THE MASTER AND LAWTON FOUND THAT BY DINT OF RUBBING THE ANIMAL'S LIMBS SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT CEASING HE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE HIS FEET IN WHAT HE CALLED SYSTEMATIC MOTION
WHO ADMINISTERED TO THE CASE NO ONE YET SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH QUICKNESS I EXPECT HE HAS MADE HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT THE SURGEON DISREGARDED THE SMILE OF THE LADIES AND PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES IT IS DOUBTLESS WISE TO BE PREPARED FOR DEATH BUT UNDER WHOSE CARE WAS THE SICK MAN DURING HIS INDISPOSITION
NOTWITHSTANDING THE SUFFERINGS OF HIS BODY HAD RISEN IN COMPLIANCE WITH A RULE FROM WHICH HE NEVER DEPARTED OF SLEEPING BUT SIX HOURS AT A TIME THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEW POINTS IN WHICH THE CARE OF THE HUMAN FRAME WAS INVOLVED ON WHICH THE TROOPER AND THE SURGEON OF HORSE WERE EVER KNOWN TO AGREE
THAT IS A QUESTION THE MAJOR CAN ANSWER BEST BUT YOU KNOW THE REDCOATS ARE ABROAD AND DUNWOODIE COMMANDS IN THE COUNTY THESE ENGLISH MUST BE LOOKED TO TRUE SAID SINGLETON SLOWLY AS IF STRUCK WITH THE OTHER'S REASONS BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE IDLE WHEN THERE IS WORK TO DO
HE HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN BRINGING ME A NURSE WHOSE PRESENCE ALONE IS ABLE TO RAISE ME FROM MY COUCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE LADY'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED
WHY MA'AM THERE WERE IN THE IRON POT IN PLAIN SIGHT FIFTY FOUR GUINEAS OF GOLD BESIDES WHAT LAY UNDERNEATH WHICH I COULDN'T COUNT WITHOUT HANDLING AND I DIDN'T LIKE TO TOUCH IT FOR THEY SAY THAT ANOTHER'S GOLD IS APT TO STICK SO JUDGING FROM THAT IN SIGHT THERE WASN'T LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
WHAT SAID THE SURGEON INTERRUPTING HER DOES HE AFFECT TO DESPISE THE NEEDLE BUT IT IS MY LOT TO MEET WITH MEN DAILY WHO ARE EQUALLY PERVERSE AND WHO SHOW A STILL MORE CULPABLE DISRESPECT FOR THE INFORMATION THAT FLOWS FROM THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE
IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF ME THAT I WANTED NOTHING BUT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE QUITE A PHYSICIAN MYSELF SO LONG AS BEFORE I CAME TO LIVE WITH HARVEY'S FATHER THEY CALLED ME THE PETTICOAT DOCTOR MORE TRUE THAN CIVIL I DARE SAY RETURNED THE SURGEON LOSING SIGHT OF THE WOMAN'S CHARACTER IN HIS ADMIRATION OF HER RESPECT FOR THE HEALING ART
IN SHORT WHARTON SAID THE COLONEL PUTTING ONE LEG OUT OF BED IT MAY BE CALLED A COMBINATION OF UNTOWARD EVENTS YOUR OWN UNGOVERNABLE HORSE PREVENTED MY ORDERS FROM BEING CARRIED TO THE MAJOR IN SEASON TO FLANK THE REBELS VERY TRUE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN KICKING A SLIPPER TOWARDS THE BED
HER BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED WITH RENOVATED BRILLIANCY AND HER FACE WAS LIGHTED WITH SMILES SO FASCINATING THAT FRANCES WHO IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER EARNEST ENTREATIES HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE SICK CHAMBER SAT GAZING ON A COUNTENANCE THAT POSSESSED SO WONDERFUL VARIABILITY
AT THE TIME OF OUR TALE WE WERE A DIVIDED PEOPLE AND SARAH THOUGHT IT WAS NO MORE THAN HER DUTY TO CHERISH THE INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY TO WHICH SHE YET CLUNG AS THE LAND OF HER FOREFATHERS BUT THERE WERE OTHER AND MORE COGENT REASONS FOR THE SILENT PREFERENCE SHE WAS GIVING TO THE ENGLISHMAN
THAT SEEMED SO OVERWHELMING A NEARER VIEW OF THE DISTURBED FEATURES OF THE VISITOR CONFIRMED MISS PEYTON IN HER BELIEF AND WITH THE SHOCK THAT GENTLE FEELINGS EVER EXPERIENCE AT A SUDDEN AND ENDLESS SEPARATION FROM EVEN THE MEANEST OF THEIR ASSOCIATES SHE SAID HASTILY
FRANCES HAD STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE ACTION AND FACE OF ISABELLA WITH A KIND OF UNEASY ADMIRATION BUT SHE NOW SPRANG TO HER SIDE WITH THE ARDOR OF A SISTER AND KINDLY DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HER OWN LED THE WAY TO A RETIRED ROOM
REPLIED TWAS THE TROUBLES OF THE TIMES AND THE LOSS OF PROPERTY THAT BROUGHT HIM DOWN HE WASTED FROM DAY TO DAY AND ALL MY CARE AND ANXIETY WERE LOST FOR NOW HARVEY IS NO BETTER THAN A BEGGAR AND WHO IS THERE TO PAY ME FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE
AND AS SUCH WAS HIGHLY PLEASED WITH WHAT HE SAID
WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
A GOOD MOTHERLY LADY BUT AS TO LOVE THAT IS A MATTER OF TASTE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER WITH DEFERENCE TO HER PRUDENCE AND EXPERIENCE WOULD ACCORD BETTER WITH MY FANCY SHE MUST BE UNDER TWENTY SAID THE OTHER QUICKLY IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY YOU COUNT IF YOU BEGIN AT THE HEEL OF LIFE WELL
HEM WITH SOMETHING OF THE KIND OF STEP YOU SPEAK OF A VERY COMPLACENT EYE AND AS TO THE BLOOM I DARE SAY OFFICES OF CHARITY CAN SUMMON AS FINE A COLOR TO HER CHEEKS AS GLOWS IN THE FACES OF HER MORE YOUTHFUL NIECES NIECES HAS SHE NIECES THEN
THE DOCTOR HAD WATCHED DURING THE NIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE BED OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE WOUNDED ENGLISHMAN WHO BEING MORE HURT IN THE SPIRIT THAN IN THE FLESH
YOU APPEAR TO BE A SENSIBLE DISCREET WOMAN AND SOME WHO HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF ACQUIRING MORE CORRECT VIEWS MIGHT ENVY YOU YOUR RESPECT FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE ALTHOUGH THE HOUSEKEEPER DID NOT ALTOGETHER COMPREHEND THE OTHER'S MEANING SHE KNEW HE USED A COMPLIMENT
THE FAMILY AT THE LOCUSTS HAD SLEPT OR WATCHED THROUGH ALL THE DISTURBANCES AT THE COTTAGE OF BIRCH IN PERFECT IGNORANCE OF THEIR OCCURRENCE THE ATTACKS OF THE SKINNERS WERE ALWAYS MADE WITH SO MUCH PRIVACY AS TO EXCLUDE THE SUFFERERS
TOLERATED THE INTERRUPTIONS WITH A VERY ILL GRACE AND ONCE FOR AN INSTANT HE VENTURED TO STEAL SOFTLY TO THE BED OF HIS OBSTINATE COMRADE AND WAS NEAR SUCCEEDING IN OBTAINING A TOUCH OF HIS PULSE WHEN A TERRIBLE OATH SWORN BY THE TROOPER IN A DREAM
HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
ON THE MARCH ISABELLA EAGERLY INQUIRED HER BROTHER NO DISMOUNTED AND SEEMINGLY AT REST WAS THE REPLY THE WONDERING DRAGOON TURNED HIS GAZE ON THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS SISTER WHO SAT WITH HER EYE BENT ON THE CARPET IN UNCONSCIOUS ABSENCE BUT FOUND NO EXPLANATION
KATY IS HE GONE NO MA'AM REPLIED THE DISTURBED DAMSEL WITH GREAT BITTERNESS HE IS NOT YET GONE BUT HE MAY GO AS SOON AS HE PLEASES NOW FOR THE WORST IS DONE
A BROTHER WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND PERHAPS A VICTIM YOUR FATHER DISTRESSED HIS PRIVACY INTERRUPTED AND NOT IMPROBABLY HIS ESTATES TORN FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS KING FRANCES CONTINUED HER WALK IN SILENCE WHILE FACING THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE VALE
BUT IF YOU RECKON DOWNWARD AS IS MOST COMMON I THINK SHE IS NEARER FORTY YOU HAVE MISTAKEN AN ELDER SISTER FOR THE AUNT SAID ISABELLA LAYING HER FAIR HAND ON THE MOUTH OF THE INVALID YOU MUST BE SILENT YOUR FEELINGS ARE BEGINNING TO AFFECT YOUR FRAME
DOCTOR SITGREAVES DOES NOT MEAN A RIG'LAR SOLDIER BUT A REGULAR PHYSICIAN MADAM SAID THE TROOPER OH CRIED THE MAIDEN AGAIN CORRECTING HERSELF FOR THE BEST OF ALL REASONS THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD SO I TOOK CARE OF HIM MYSELF
HIS CASE YOUNG LADY EXCEEDS MY ART TO HEAL AND I TAKE IT SIR HENRY CLINTON IS THE BEST ADVISER HE CAN APPLY TO THOUGH MAJOR DUNWOODIE HAS MADE THE COMMUNICATION WITH HIS LEECH RATHER DIFFICULT FRANCES SMILED BUT AVERTED HER FACE WHILE SARAH MOVED WITH THE GRACE OF AN OFFENDED JUNO FROM THE APARTMENT
AND DOCTOR SITGREAVES REMOVED ALL FURTHER APPREHENSIONS BY CONFIDENTLY PRONOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE A WELL MAN WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
HARVEY IS AS OBSTINATE ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS A DUMB BEAST ONE WOULD THINK THE CARE I TOOK OF HIS BEDRIDDEN FATHER MIGHT LEARN HIM BETTER THAN TO DESPISE GOOD NURSING BUT SOME DAY HE MAY KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANT A CAREFUL WOMAN IN HIS HOUSE THOUGH NOW I AM SURE HE IS TOO DESPISABLE HIMSELF TO HAVE A HOUSE
SPEAK I BEG WITHOUT DREAD OF MY DISPLEASURE SAID FRANCES RETURNING THE GOOD HUMORED SMILE OF THE TROOPER WITH THE ARCHNESS NATURAL TO HER OWN SWEET FACE THE ODORS OF YOUR KITCHEN THEN CRIED LAWTON BLUNTLY FORBID MY QUITTING THE DOMAINS UNTIL I QUALIFY MYSELF TO SPEAK WITH MORE CERTAINTY CONCERNING THE FATNESS OF THE LAND
HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS OWN ROOM AND NOTWITHSTANDING CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SMILES OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE
THEREIN YOU SHOW YOUR SENSE SAID THE SURGEON APPROACHING THE SPINSTER WHO SAT HOLDING THE PALMS OF HER HANDS AND THE SOLES OF HER FEET TO THE GENIAL HEAT OF A FINE FIRE MAKING THE MOST OF COMFORT AMID ALL HER TROUBLES
THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE ENLIGHTENED COUNSELORS THE EXPERIENCE OF A DISCREET MATRON IS FREQUENTLY OF GREAT EFFICACY IN CHECKING THE PROGRESS OF DISEASE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MADAM IT IS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO CONTEND WITH IGNORANCE AND OBSTINACY
AND BY HIS SYMPATHY SUCCEEDED IN RESTORING THE COLONEL TO HIS OWN GOOD GRACES
AND FEARFUL THE CONVERSATION WOULD CEASE HE INQUIRED WITH AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT INTEREST YOU THINK IT WAS AGE AND DEBILITY THAT REMOVED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AT LAST AND THE TROUBLESOME TIMES TROUBLE IS A HEAVY PULL DOWN TO A SICK BED
HER OWN ROOM HOWEVER AFFORDED HER BUT LITTLE RELIEF AND IN PASSING THROUGH THE LONG GALLERY THAT COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE BUILDING SHE NOTICED THE DOOR OF SINGLETON'S ROOM TO BE OPEN THE WOUNDED YOUTH SEEMED SLEEPING AND WAS ALONE
BUT FREQUENTLY THROUGH A DREAD OF FUTURE DEPREDATIONS FROM THE COMMISERATION OF THEIR NEIGHBORS ALSO ADDITIONAL DUTIES HAD DRAWN THE LADIES FROM THEIR PILLOWS AT AN HOUR SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL AND CAPTAIN LAWTON
DOCTOR SITGREAVES SUPPORTED HER FROM THE CHAISE AND WHEN SHE GAINED THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA SHE TURNED AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PRACTITIONER YOUR BROTHER IS OUT OF DANGER AND WISHES TO SEE YOU MISS SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON THE LADY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
ORDERS WERE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN TO BE IN READINESS TO REJOIN THE TROOP AT THE FOUR CORNERS AS SOON AS HIS MASTER HAD SHARED IN THE BOUNTY OF THE APPROACHING BANQUET
IMPELLED BY A CHARM THAT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL THE YOUTH HAD THROWN AN EARNEST LOOK AT FRANCES AS SOON AS HIS SISTER RAISED HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE LOVELY LINEAMENTS OF OUR HEROINE
FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHEN HE MADE HIS MORNING ENTRANCE BUT AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT PRESIDED OVER THE COMFORTS OF THE ENGLISH COLONEL SARAH HAD SHRUNK WITH CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ENTERING THE ROOM YET SHE KNEW THE POSITION OF EVERY GLASS AND HAD WITH HER OWN HANDS SUPPLIED THE CONTENTS OF EVERY BOWL THAT STOOD ON HIS TABLE
FRANCES FIXED HER LAUGHING EYES ON HER SISTER BUT FORBEARING TO SPEAK THE OTHER READILY CONSTRUED THEIR EXPRESSION AND HASTILY ADDED BUT I FORGET HE IS ONE OF YOUR RENOWNED CORPS OF VIRGINIANS AND MUST BE SPOKEN OF REVERENTLY AS RESPECTFULLY AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR SISTER
STILL FRANCES COULD WITH DIFFICULTY WITHDRAW HER TRUANT EYES FROM THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR VISITOR SHE WAS YOUNG AND OF A LIGHT AND FRAGILE FORM BUT OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS HER EYES WERE LARGE FULL BLACK PIERCING AND AT TIMES A LITTLE WILD HER HAIR WAS LUXURIANT
IT WAS THROWN OPEN BY A DRAGOON WHO FOLLOWED THE CARRIAGE AND WHO HAD BEEN THE MESSENGER DISPATCHED BY DUNWOODIE TO THE FATHER OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON MISS PEYTON ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR GUEST AND THE SISTERS UNITED IN GIVING HER THE KINDEST WELCOME
FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
THE MAJOR CONSIDERATE DUNWOODIE MURMURED THE EXHAUSTED YOUTH SINKING AGAIN ON HIS PILLOW WHERE THE COMMANDS OF HIS ATTENDANT COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN SILENT EVEN CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN RECEIVED WITH MANY AND COURTEOUS INQUIRIES AFTER THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
OH AUNT JEANETTE IS EXERTING HERSELF TO DO CREDIT TO MY FATHER'S HOSPITALITY SAID THE LAUGHING GIRL AND I AM A TRUANT FROM HER LABORS AS I SHALL BE A STRANGER TO HER FAVOR UNLESS I PROFFER MY ASSISTANCE
STARTLED THE PRUDENT SURGEON AND WARNED HIM OF A TRITE SAYING IN THE CORPS THAT CAPTAIN LAWTON ALWAYS SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN THIS GROUP HAD ASSEMBLED IN ONE OF THE PARLORS AS THE SUN MADE ITS APPEARANCE OVER THE EASTERN HILL DISPERSING THE COLUMNS OF FOG WHICH HAD ENVELOPED THE LOWLAND
AND THE LATTER ADVANCED PROMPTLY AND LAID HIS FINGERS ON THE PULSE OF THE YOUTH BECKONING TO HIM TO BE SILENT WHILE HE MUTTERED GROWING SYMPTOMS OF A FEBRILE PULSE NO NO MY DEAR GEORGE YOU MUST REMAIN QUIET AND DUMB THOUGH YOUR EYES LOOK BETTER AND YOUR SKIN HAS EVEN A MOISTURE
WHY RETURNED THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATING A LITTLE I THOUGHT WE WERE AS GOOD AS SO I WONDER IF I HAVE NO CLAIM ON THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOW IT IS HARVEY'S IT WILL SURELY BE CONFISCATED TURNING TO LAWTON WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN ONE POSTURE WITH HIS
HE ANSWERED THE APPLICANT WITH A GOOD NATURED SMILE I JUDGE NOT IF DEATH HAS ANTICIPATED YOUR NUPTIALS I AM FEARFUL YOU HAVE NO REMEDY AGAINST HIS STERN DECREES TO KATY THIS SOUNDED WELL ALTHOUGH SHE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF ITS MEANING BUT DEATH AND NUPTIALS
DESCENDED AND WENT INTO CURZON STREET HIS SWORD BETWEEN HIS LEGS LITTLE RAWDON STOOD WITH HIS FACE AGAINST THE PARLOUR WINDOW PANES SMILING AND NODDING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO HIS AUNT IN THE CARRIAGE WITHIN
ASKED MEN DO THAT BECKY ANSWERED BITTERLY WOMEN ARE NOT SO BAD AS YOU
AS SHE SAT AT WORK AND SITTING DOWN TO THE PIANO SHE RATTLED AWAY A TRIUMPHANT VOLUNTARY ON THE KEYS WHICH MADE THE PEOPLE PAUSE UNDER HER WINDOW TO LISTEN TO HER BRILLIANT MUSIC THAT NIGHT
AND PRESENTLY SIR PITT ISSUED FORTH FROM THE HOUSE AGAIN LEADING FORTH A LADY WITH GRAND FEATHERS COVERED IN A WHITE SHAWL AND HOLDING UP DAINTILY A TRAIN OF MAGNIFICENT BROCADE SHE STEPPED INTO THE VEHICLE
BUT THE FINEST SPORT OF ALL AFTER HER PRESENTATION WAS TO HEAR HER TALK VIRTUOUSLY
AND WE HAD NECK OF MUTTON AND TURNIPS
I DAREN'T SLEEP IN WHAT THEY CALL MY BEDROOM THE BED IS LIKE THE BALDAQUIN OF SAINT PETER'S AND THE PICTURES FRIGHTEN ME I HAVE A LITTLE BRASS BED IN A DRESSING ROOM AND A LITTLE HAIR MATTRESS LIKE AN ANCHORITE I AM AN ANCHORITE
THESE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED BECKY PAID A VISIT UPSTAIRS TO THE BEFORE MENTIONED DESK WHICH AMELIA SEDLEY HAD GIVEN HER YEARS AND YEARS AGO AND WHICH CONTAINED A NUMBER OF USEFUL AND VALUABLE LITTLE THINGS IN WHICH PRIVATE MUSEUM SHE PLACED THE ONE NOTE WHICH
AT WHICH REBECCA HELD DOWN HER HEAD THE MORE AND CRIED BITTERLY I COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS MY ONLY CHANCE I DARE NOT TELL MY HUSBAND HE WOULD KILL ME IF I TOLD HIM WHAT I HAVE DONE I HAVE KEPT IT A SECRET FROM EVERYBODY BUT YOU AND YOU FORCED IT FROM ME
THERE CAME TWO NOTES FROM GAUNT HOUSE FOR THE LITTLE WOMAN THE ONE CONTAINING A CARD OF INVITATION FROM LORD AND LADY STEYNE TO A DINNER AT GAUNT HOUSE NEXT FRIDAY WHILE THE OTHER ENCLOSED A SLIP OF GRAY PAPER BEARING LORD STEYNE'S SIGNATURE AND THE ADDRESS OF MESSRS JONES
BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IT WAS THE FIRST GENTLEMAN IN EUROPE IN WHOSE HIGH PRESENCE MISSUS RAWDON PASSED HER EXAMINATION AND AS IT WERE TOOK HER DEGREE IN REPUTATION IT SURELY MUST BE FLAT DISLOYALTY
ON THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE WHERE BECKY KEPT THE CARDS OF HER VISITORS
WHICH OTHERS ARE SLOW TO PERCEIVE HOW FOR INSTANCE COMUS FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT HE IS THE GREATEST TRAGIC ACTOR IN ENGLAND HOW BROWN THE FAMOUS NOVELIST LONGS TO BE CONSIDERED NOT A MAN OF GENIUS BUT A MAN OF FASHION
TO WAIT UPON HIS MAJESTY BECAUSE MY OWN CARRIAGE IS NOT FORTHCOMING IT APPEARS THERE HAD BEEN A DIFFERENCE ON THE LAST DRAWING ROOM DAY HENCE THE DEGRADATION WHICH THE COLONEL HAD ALMOST SUFFERED OF BEING OBLIGED TO ENTER THE PRESENCE OF HIS SOVEREIGN IN A HACK CAB
SHE GAVE US EVERYTHING SHE SHALL NEVER LEAVE ME UNTIL WE ARE RUINED UTTERLY OURSELVES
OF HIS KINGDOM DO YOU REMEMBER
YOU WILL GO TO GAUNT HOUSE YOU GIVE AN OLD FELLOW NO REST UNTIL YOU GET THERE IT'S NOT HALF SO NICE AS HERE YOU'LL BE BORED THERE I AM MY WIFE IS AS GAY AS LADY MACBETH AND MY DAUGHTERS AS CHEERFUL AS REGAN AND GONERIL
THE CARRIAGE ROLLED DOWN THE STREET UNTIL ITS CARGO WAS FINALLY DISCHARGED AT THE GATES OF THE PALACE WHERE THE SOVEREIGN WAS SITTING IN STATE THE DIAMONDS WHICH HAD CREATED RAWDON'S ADMIRATION
WHICH CONFINED A PEARL NECKLACE WHICH SHE WORE AND THE BARONET HAD OMITTED TO MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO HIS LADY BECKY LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND AND THEN AT SIR PITT WITH AN AIR OF SAUCY TRIUMPH AS MUCH AS TO SAY SHALL I BETRAY YOU
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN IN VANITY FAIR WHEN THAT REVERED AND AUGUST BEING WAS INVESTED BY THE UNIVERSAL ACCLAIM OF THE REFINED AND EDUCATED PORTION OF THIS EMPIRE WITH THE TITLE OF PREMIER GENTILHOMME
SHE GENTLY SAID SHE WOULD TAKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS IN SMALL NOTES AND THE REMAINDER IN ONE NOTE AND PASSING THROUGH SAINT PAUL'S CHURCHYARD STOPPED THERE AND BOUGHT THE HANDSOMEST BLACK SILK GOWN FOR BRIGGS WHICH MONEY COULD BUY AND WHICH
WORSE THAN THAT SAID BECKY STILL CASTING DOWN HER EYES I HAVE RUINED HER RUINED HER
UNTIL SHE HAS PUT ON A TRAIN AND FEATHERS AND HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO HER SOVEREIGN AT COURT FROM THAT AUGUST INTERVIEW THEY COME OUT STAMPED AS HONEST WOMEN THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN GIVES THEM A CERTIFICATE OF VIRTUE
SOME FAINTED WITH EMOTION PEOPLE WERE SUFFOCATED IN THE PIT SHRIEKS AND GROANS RISING UP AMIDST THE WRITHING AND SHOUTING MASS THERE OF HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE AND INDEED SHOWED THEMSELVES ALMOST TO BE READY TO DIE FOR HIM
ANOTHER GREAT AND EXCEEDING HONOUR WAS VOUCHSAFED TO THE VIRTUOUS BECKY LADY STEYNE'S CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO MISTER RAWDON CRAWLEY'S DOOR AND THE FOOTMAN INSTEAD OF DRIVING DOWN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS BY HIS TREMENDOUS KNOCKING HE APPEARED TO BE INCLINED TO DO
RELENTED AND ONLY DELIVERED IN A COUPLE OF CARDS ON WHICH WERE ENGRAVEN THE NAMES OF THE MARCHIONESS OF STEYNE AND THE COUNTESS OF GAUNT IF THESE BITS OF PASTEBOARD
WE MAY BE SURE THAT BECKY AND BRIGGS LOOKED OUT THOSE AUGUST NAMES IN THE PEERAGE AND FOLLOWED THE NOBLE RACES UP THROUGH ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE FAMILY TREE MY LORD STEYNE
AND TO APPEAR ON DRURY LANE STAGE AMONGST A CROWD WHICH ASSEMBLED THERE TO GREET THE KING THE KING THERE HE WAS BEEFEATERS WERE BEFORE THE AUGUST BOX THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE LORD OF THE POWDER CLOSET
KNEW WHENCE THE JEWELS CAME AND WHO PAID FOR THEM AS HE BOWED OVER HER HE SMILED
HOW POOR MISSUS WASHINGTON WHITE'S CARD AND LADY CRACKENBURY'S CARD WHICH OUR LITTLE FRIEND HAD BEEN GLAD ENOUGH TO GET A FEW MONTHS BACK AND OF WHICH THE SILLY LITTLE CREATURE WAS RATHER PROUD ONCE LORD LORD I SAY
IF YOU HAD BEEN SANDY HAIRED GREEN EYED AND A FRENCH ROPE DANCER'S DAUGHTER MISSUS BUTE SAID TO HER ELDEST GIRL WHO ON THE CONTRARY WAS A VERY SWARTHY SHORT AND SNUB NOSED YOUNG LADY
LOMBARD STREET RAWDON HEARD BECKY LAUGHING IN THE NIGHT ONCE OR TWICE IT WAS ONLY HER DELIGHT AT GOING TO GAUNT HOUSE AND FACING THE LADIES THERE SHE SAID WHICH AMUSED HER SO BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT SHE WAS OCCUPIED WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER THOUGHTS
AS LORD OF THE POWDER CLOSET AND ONE OF THE GREAT DIGNITARIES AND ILLUSTRIOUS DEFENCES OF THE THRONE OF ENGLAND AND CAME UP WITH ALL HIS STARS GARTERS COLLARS AND CORDONS AND PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE LITTLE WOMAN
AND ORDERED THE FINEST PORTRAIT OF HIM THAT ART HAD PRODUCED AND CREDIT COULD SUPPLY SHE CHOSE THAT FAMOUS ONE IN WHICH THE BEST OF MONARCHS IS REPRESENTED IN A FROCK COAT
AND BREECHES AND SILK STOCKINGS SIMPERING ON A SOFA FROM UNDER HIS CURLY BROWN WIG SHE HAD HIM PAINTED IN A BROOCH AND WORE IT
NEVER WENT BACK TO MISTER POLONIUS OF COVENTRY STREET AND THAT GENTLEMAN NEVER APPLIED FOR THEIR RESTORATION BUT THEY RETIRED INTO A LITTLE PRIVATE REPOSITORY IN AN OLD DESK WHICH AMELIA SEDLEY HAD GIVEN HER YEARS AND YEARS AGO
YES WE SAW HIM FATE CANNOT DEPRIVE US OF THAT OTHERS HAVE SEEN NAPOLEON SOME FEW STILL EXIST WHO HAVE BEHELD FREDERICK THE GREAT DOCTOR JOHNSON
SOME FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS SINCE AS THE MOST BRILLIANT COSTUME OF THE MOST FAMOUS BEAUTY OF THE PRESENT SEASON A SCORE OF YEARS HENCE THAT TOO THAT MILLINER'S WONDER WILL HAVE PASSED INTO THE DOMAIN OF THE ABSURD
WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN REBECCA CRAWLEY
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD YOUR OWN THERE YOU SILLY LITTLE FOOL YOU'VE GOT NO MONEY YOU WILL GET US A PLACE INTERPOSED BECKY AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE YOU'VE GOT NO MONEY AND YOU WANT TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE
AND FORGOT THAT THERE WAS NO MONEY IN THE CHEST AT HOME DUNS ROUND THE GATE TRADESMEN TO COAX AND WHEEDLE NO GROUND TO WALK UPON IN A WORD AND AS SHE WENT TO COURT IN THE CARRIAGE THE FAMILY CARRIAGE
AND OTHER GREAT OFFICERS OF STATE WERE BEHIND THE CHAIR ON WHICH HE SAT HE SAT FLORID OF FACE PORTLY OF PERSON COVERED WITH ORDERS AND IN A RICH CURLING HEAD OF HAIR HOW WE SANG GOD SAVE HIM
SAID THE PEER WITH AN OATH AND BECKY REFLECTING ON THE LARGENESS OF HIS MEANS MENTIONED NOT ONLY THE SUM WHICH SHE HAD BORROWED FROM MISS BRIGGS BUT ONE OF NEARLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT THIS CAUSED THE LORD STEYNE TO BREAK OUT IN ANOTHER BRIEF AND ENERGETIC EXPRESSION OF ANGER
AS SHE LOOKED AT HER KINSWOMAN AND OWNED SORROWFULLY TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS QUITE INFERIOR IN TASTE TO MISSUS BECKY
THE PARTICULARS OF BECKY'S COSTUME WERE IN THE NEWSPAPERS FEATHERS LAPPETS SUPERB DIAMONDS AND ALL THE REST LADY CRACKENBURY READ THE PARAGRAPH IN BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT AND DISCOURSED TO HER FOLLOWERS
HER COMPLEXION COULD BEAR ANY SUNSHINE AS YET AND HER DRESS THOUGH IF YOU WERE TO SEE IT NOW ANY PRESENT LADY OF VANITY FAIR WOULD PRONOUNCE IT TO BE THE MOST FOOLISH AND PREPOSTEROUS ATTIRE EVER WORN WAS AS HANDSOME IN HER EYES AND THOSE OF THE PUBLIC
AND I HOPE THIS WILL BE A LESSON TO YOU SPAVIN SHE SAID AND THAT ON THE NEXT DRAWING ROOM DAY MY BROTHER SIR PITT
SO ELATED WAS SHE IN SPIRIT AND SO STRONG A SENSE HAD SHE OF THE DIGNIFIED POSITION WHICH SHE HAD AT LAST ATTAINED IN LIFE EVEN OUR BECKY HAD HER WEAKNESSES AND AS ONE OFTEN SEES HOW MEN PRIDE THEMSELVES UPON EXCELLENCES
IF GOOD QUEEN CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN ALIVE IN THIS WAY THE WORTHY RECTORESS CONSOLED HERSELF AND HER DAUGHTERS SIGHED AND SAT OVER THE PEERAGE ALL NIGHT A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FAMOUS PRESENTATION
HOW SOON AT THE APPEARANCE OF THESE GRAND COURT CARDS DID THOSE POOR LITTLE NEGLECTED DEUCES SINK DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK STEYNE BAREACRES JOHNES OF HELVELLYN AND CAERYLON OF CAMELOT
IF YOU DON'T TURN OFF THAT ABOMINABLE SHEEP DOG SAID LORD STEYNE WITH A SAVAGE LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER AT HER
WITH WHICH TIME HAS MARKED HER FACE NO DRAWING ROOMS SHOULD BE ANNOUNCED FOR NOVEMBER
HE SAID GOOD NATUREDLY YOU SILLY LITTLE FIBSTER I HEARD YOU IN THE ROOM OVERHEAD WHERE I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU WERE PUTTING A LITTLE ROUGE ON YOU MUST GIVE SOME OF YOURS TO MY LADY GAUNT WHOSE COMPLEXION IS QUITE PREPOSTEROUS
AS THIS OLD CYNIC ALWAYS DID AT ANY NAIVE DISPLAY OF HUMAN WEAKNESS BECKY CAME DOWN TO HIM PRESENTLY
AND AS DUBIOUS GOODS OR LETTERS ARE PASSED THROUGH AN OVEN AT QUARANTINE SPRINKLED WITH
MANY A LADY WHOSE REPUTATION WOULD BE DOUBTFUL OTHERWISE AND LIABLE TO GIVE INFECTION PASSES THROUGH THE WHOLESOME ORDEAL OF THE ROYAL PRESENCE AND ISSUES FROM IT FREE FROM ALL TAINT
A HUNDRED YARDS OF MALINES LACE ROLLED ROUND THEM WORTH TWICE THE NUMBER OF GUINEAS BECKY COULD NOT HAVE REGARDED THEM WITH MORE PLEASURE YOU MAY BE SURE THEY OCCUPIED A CONSPICUOUS PLACE IN THE CHINA BOWL
TO DOUBT ANY MORE ABOUT HER VIRTUE I FOR MY PART LOOK BACK WITH LOVE AND AWE TO THAT GREAT CHARACTER IN HISTORY AH WHAT A HIGH AND NOBLE APPRECIATION OF GENTLEWOMANHOOD
IF SHE DID NOT WISH TO LEAD A VIRTUOUS LIFE AT LEAST SHE DESIRED TO ENJOY A CHARACTER FOR VIRTUE AND WE KNOW THAT NO LADY IN THE GENTEEL WORLD
THE BROCADE WAS AN OLD REMNANT BECKY SAID AND AS FOR THE LACE IT WAS A GREAT BARGAIN SHE HAD HAD IT THESE HUNDRED YEARS MY DEAR MISSUS CRAWLEY
AFTER A PAUSE AND IN A VERY SAD VOICE HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS SHE SPOKE AND SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
YOU'LL BE ASKED TO DINNER NEXT WEEK AND GARE AUX FEMMES LOOK OUT AND HOLD YOUR OWN HOW THE WOMEN WILL BULLY YOU THIS WAS A VERY LONG SPEECH FOR A MAN OF FEW WORDS LIKE MY LORD STEYNE
BUT PREVENT ITS REFLUX NOR DO WE NEED TO SEEK ANY OTHER REASON FOR THE NUMBER OF THESE PELLICLES BEYOND THIS THAT THE ORIFICE OF THE VENOUS ARTERY BEING OF AN OVAL SHAPE FROM THE NATURE OF ITS SITUATION CAN BE ADEQUATELY CLOSED WITH TWO
ON ALL THE BODIES THAT ARE UPON THE EARTH SINCE THEY ARE EITHER COLORED OR TRANSPARENT OR LUMINOUS AND FINALLY ON MAN SINCE HE IS THE SPECTATOR OF THESE OBJECTS
AND FINALLY HOW FROM THESE ASHES
AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN WERE IT NOT THAT THE BLOOD OF THE VENOUS ARTERY HAVING ONLY BEEN IN THE LUNGS AFTER IT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEART IS THINNER AND RAREFIES MORE READILY AND IN A HIGHER DEGREE
NATURE MUST PRODUCE THEM I REMAINED SATISFIED WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT GOD FORMED THE BODY OF MAN WHOLLY LIKE TO ONE OF OURS AS WELL IN THE EXTERNAL SHAPE OF THE MEMBERS AS IN THE INTERNAL CONFORMATION OF THE ORGANS
WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
AS THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH I HAD SPOKEN BUT THAT IT MUST BE EXPRESSLY CREATED AND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT IT BE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BODY EXACTLY LIKE A PILOT IN A SHIP UNLESS PERHAPS TO MOVE ITS MEMBERS
FROM THE VERY ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE HEART BY THE EYE ALONE AND FROM THE HEAT WHICH MAY BE FELT WITH THE FINGERS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE BLOOD AS LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE AS DOES THE MOTION OF A CLOCK FROM THE POWER
I ENDEAVORED TO DEMONSTRATE ALL THOSE ABOUT WHICH THERE COULD BE ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT
I HAVE EVER REMAINED FIRM IN MY ORIGINAL RESOLUTION TO SUPPOSE NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN THAT OF WHICH I HAVE RECENTLY AVAILED MYSELF IN DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND OF THE SOUL
BUT LIKE THE PAINTERS WHO FINDING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPRESENT EQUALLY WELL ON A PLAIN SURFACE ALL THE DIFFERENT FACES OF A SOLID BODY SELECT ONE OF THE CHIEF ON WHICH ALONE THEY MAKE THE LIGHT FALL AND THROWING THE REST INTO THE SHADE
PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
AND FINALLY THAT THIS HEAT IS CAPABLE OF CAUSING ANY DROP OF BLOOD THAT PASSES INTO THE CAVITIES RAPIDLY TO EXPAND AND DILATE JUST AS ALL LIQUORS DO WHEN ALLOWED TO FALL DROP BY DROP INTO A HIGHLY HEATED VESSEL
I HAD EXPOUNDED ALL THESE MATTERS WITH SUFFICIENT MINUTENESS IN THE TREATISE WHICH I FORMERLY THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING AND AFTER THESE I HAD SHOWN WHAT MUST BE THE FABRIC OF THE NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
SHOULD NOT IN THIS BE EQUAL TO THE MOST STUPID INFANT OF ITS KIND OR AT LEAST TO ONE THAT WAS CRACK BRAINED UNLESS THE SOUL OF BRUTES
THAT THERE ARE NO MEN SO DULL AND STUPID NOT EVEN IDIOTS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF JOINING TOGETHER DIFFERENT WORDS AND THEREBY CONSTRUCTING A DECLARATION BY WHICH TO MAKE THEIR THOUGHTS UNDERSTOOD
AND ESSAYED TO REPRESENT IT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT TO MY MIND THERE CAN BE NOTHING CLEARER AND MORE INTELLIGIBLE EXCEPT WHAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY SAID REGARDING GOD AND THE SOUL
WILL AFFORD THE MEANS OF READILY DETERMINING WHAT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF ALL THE REST
FOR EXAMPLE IF TOUCHED IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IT MAY DEMAND WHAT WE WISH TO SAY TO IT IF IN ANOTHER IT MAY CRY OUT THAT IT IS HURT AND SUCH LIKE
AS TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF HEAVENS HOW IN THE MEANTIME SOME OF ITS PARTS MUST COMPOSE AN EARTH AND SOME PLANETS AND COMETS AND OTHERS A SUN AND FIXED STARS AND MAKING A DIGRESSION AT THIS STAGE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIGHT
WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTACLE OF THE BLOOD AND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AS IT WERE OF WHICH ALL THE OTHER VEINS IN THE BODY ARE BRANCHES AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN VENA ARTERIOSA INAPPROPRIATELY SO DENOMINATED
WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IT IS DISTILLED BY PASSING AND REPASSING THROUGH THE HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES IN A DAY
WHERE IT IS DIVIDED INTO MANY BRANCHES INTERLACED WITH THOSE OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND THOSE OF THE TUBE CALLED THE WINDPIPE THROUGH WHICH THE AIR WE BREATHE ENTERS AND THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH ISSUING FROM THE HEART SENDS ITS BRANCHES ALL OVER THE BODY
WHICH IS IN THE BODY MAY FLOW OUT OF IT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THROUGH A SINGLE ARTERY THAT HAS BEEN CUT
TO SATISFY MYSELF IN A SHORT TIME ON ALL THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE USUALLY TREATED OF IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED CERTAIN LAWS ESTABLISHED IN NATURE BY GOD IN SUCH A MANNER
BECAUSE NO OTHER CAUSES ARE OBSERVED CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT
FOR I EVEN EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT IT POSSESSED NONE OF THOSE FORMS OR QUALITIES WHICH ARE SO DEBATED IN THE SCHOOLS NOR IN GENERAL ANYTHING THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IS NOT SO NATURAL TO OUR MINDS
BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
IS THE GENERATION OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WHICH ARE LIKE A VERY SUBTLE WIND OR RATHER A VERY PURE AND VIVID FLAME WHICH
BUT SINCE I HAD NOT AS YET SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE TO ENABLE ME TO TREAT OF THESE IN THE SAME MANNER AS OF THE REST THAT IS TO SAY BY DEDUCING EFFECTS FROM THEIR CAUSES AND BY SHOWING
AND ADEQUATE TO MOVEMENTS MORE ADMIRABLE THAN IS ANY MACHINE OF HUMAN INVENTION AND HERE I SPECIALLY STAYED TO SHOW THAT WERE THERE SUCH MACHINES EXACTLY RESEMBLING ORGANS AND OUTWARD FORM AN APE OR ANY OTHER IRRATIONAL ANIMAL
TWO CANALS IN SIZE EQUAL TO OR LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING VIZ THE VENOUS ARTERY ARTERIA VENOSA LIKEWISE INAPPROPRIATELY THUS DESIGNATED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A VEIN WHICH COMES FROM THE LUNGS
IT THENCE HAPPENS THAT THEIR MOTION IS THE CONTRARY OF THAT OF THE HEART AND THAT WHEN IT EXPANDS THEY CONTRACT BUT LEST THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE FORCE OF MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS AND WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DISTINGUISH
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF THESE HEAVENS AND STARS SO THAT I THOUGHT I HAD SAID ENOUGH RESPECTING THEM TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVABLE IN THE HEAVENS OR STARS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST NOT OR AT LEAST MAY NOT APPEAR PRECISELY ALIKE IN THOSE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I DESCRIBED
MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
THE OPENING VERY TIGHT FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE TIE MODERATELY STRAIGHTENED WHILE ADEQUATE TO HINDER THE BLOOD ALREADY IN THE ARM FROM RETURNING TOWARDS THE HEART BY THE VEINS CANNOT ON THAT ACCOUNT PREVENT NEW BLOOD
AND HOW THENCE IN AN INSTANT OF TIME IT TRAVERSES THE IMMENSE SPACES OF THE HEAVENS AND HOW FROM THE PLANETS AND COMETS IT IS REFLECTED TOWARDS THE EARTH TO THIS I LIKEWISE ADDED MUCH RESPECTING THE SUBSTANCE THE SITUATION THE MOTIONS
BY THE FANTASY WHICH CAN CHANGE THEM IN VARIOUS WAYS AND OUT OF THEM COMPOSE NEW IDEAS AND WHICH BY THE SAME MEANS DISTRIBUTING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS THROUGH THE MUSCLES CAN CAUSE THE MEMBERS OF SUCH A BODY TO MOVE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
AND THIS PROVES NOT ONLY THAT THE BRUTES HAVE LESS REASON THAN MAN BUT THAT THEY HAVE NONE AT ALL FOR WE SEE THAT VERY LITTLE IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SPEAK
THERE IS NONE THAT IS MORE POWERFUL IN LEADING FEEBLE MINDS ASTRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH OF VIRTUE
TO SHOW HOW IT CAN INDUCE VARIOUS COLORS UPON DIFFERENT BODIES AND OTHER DIVERSE QUALITIES HOW IT REDUCES SOME TO A LIQUID STATE AND HARDENS OTHERS HOW IT CAN CONSUME ALMOST ALL BODIES OR CONVERT THEM INTO ASHES AND SMOKE
TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
THAT THOUGH THERE ARE MANY ANIMALS WHICH MANIFEST MORE INDUSTRY THAN WE IN CERTAIN OF THEIR ACTIONS THE SAME ANIMALS ARE YET OBSERVED TO SHOW NONE AT ALL IN MANY OTHERS SO THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY DO BETTER
OF THE SAME MATTER WITH THAT I HAD DESCRIBED AND AT FIRST PLACED IN IT NO RATIONAL SOUL NOR ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE IN ROOM OF THE VEGETATIVE OR SENSITIVE SOUL BEYOND KINDLING IN THE HEART ONE OF THOSE FIRES WITHOUT LIGHT
AND TO ACCEPT AS TRUE NOTHING THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME MORE CLEAR AND CERTAIN THAN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE GEOMETERS HAD FORMERLY APPEARED AND YET I VENTURE TO STATE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE I FOUND MEANS
I CAME NEXT TO SPEAK OF THE EARTH IN PARTICULAR AND TO SHOW HOW EVEN THOUGH I HAD EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT GOD HAD GIVEN NO WEIGHT TO THE MATTER OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THIS SHOULD NOT PREVENT ALL ITS PARTS FROM TENDING EXACTLY
SINCE THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH MANY ORGANS ANALOGOUS TO OURS THEY COULD AS EASILY COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US AS TO THEIR FELLOWS
WHICH FLOW FORTH FROM THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART AND TEND TOWARDS THE BRAIN THE WEAKER AND LESS AGITATED PARTS MUST NECESSARILY BE DRIVEN ASIDE FROM THAT POINT BY THE STRONGER WHICH ALONE IN THIS WAY REACH IT
MATTER SUFFICIENT TO COMPOSE ONE AND WERE TO AGITATE VARIOUSLY AND CONFUSEDLY THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS MATTER SO THAT THERE RESULTED A CHAOS AS DISORDERED AS THE POETS EVER FEIGNED
AND TO HAVE SHOWN TO THEM ITS TWO VENTRICLES OR CAVITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WITH WHICH CORRESPOND TWO VERY AMPLE TUBES VIZ THE HOLLOW VEIN VENA CAVA
I WOULD HERE WILLINGLY HAVE PROCEEDED TO EXHIBIT THE WHOLE CHAIN OF TRUTHS WHICH I DEDUCED FROM THESE PRIMARY BUT AS WITH A VIEW TO THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY NOW TO TREAT OF MANY QUESTIONS
AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT IN HAY THAT HAS BEEN HEAPED TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS DRY OR THAT WHICH CAUSES FERMENTATION IN NEW WINES BEFORE THEY ARE RUN CLEAR OF THE FRUIT FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT
AND THERE OCCUPY THE PLACE OF SOME OTHERS EXPELLED BY THEM AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION SHAPE OR SMALLNESS OF THE PORES WITH WHICH THEY MEET SOME RATHER THAN OTHERS FLOW INTO CERTAIN PARTS
I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO REFRAIN FROM THIS EXPOSITION AND ONLY MENTION IN GENERAL WHAT THESE TRUTHS ARE THAT THE MORE JUDICIOUS MAY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MORE SPECIAL ACCOUNT OF THEM WOULD CONDUCE TO THE PUBLIC ADVANTAGE
AND AFTER THAT DID NOTHING MORE THAN LEND HIS ORDINARY CONCURRENCE TO NATURE AND ALLOW HER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THIS SUPPOSITION I IN THE FIRST PLACE DESCRIBED THIS MATTER
AND MORE VIVID AND WARMER IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE HEART IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IN THE ARTERIES THAN IT WAS A SHORT TIME BEFORE PASSING INTO EITHER IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IT WAS IN THE VEINS
AS CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUPPOSITION EXIST IN THIS BODY I FOUND PRECISELY ALL THOSE WHICH MAY EXIST IN US INDEPENDENTLY
AND THE SIX SMALL VALVES CLOSE AND THE FIVE OF THE HOLLOW
AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING SOMETHING ON THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS SINCE LIGHT ALMOST WHOLLY PROCEEDS FROM THEM ON THE HEAVENS SINCE THEY TRANSMIT IT ON THE PLANETS COMETS AND EARTH SINCE THEY REFLECT IT AND PARTICULARLY
I RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TO THEIR DISPUTES AND TO SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NEW WORLD IF GOD WERE NOW TO CREATE SOMEWHERE IN THE IMAGINARY SPACES
FOR HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME WHICH WAS OF SOME MOMENT AFTER SOME VERY KIND EXPRESSIONS HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE VERY HONEST TO HIM AND GIVE A SINCERE ANSWER TO ONE THING HE WOULD DESIRE OF ME
AS SHE DID AT FIRST AS WELL AS I TAKING IT AS I FANCIED HE WOULD AS SOMETHING FORWARD OF HER BUT WHEN HE SAW ME GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER HE CAME IMMEDIATELY TO HIMSELF AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING WE TALKED OF IT AGAIN WHEN I FOUND HE WAS FULLY SATISFIED
CALLED SHEPTON WHERE HE HAD SOME BUSINESS AND WAS THERE TAKEN VERY ILL AND SO ILL THAT HE COULD NOT TRAVEL SO HE SENT HIS MAN BACK TO BATH TO BEG ME THAT I WOULD HIRE A COACH AND COME OVER TO HIM BEFORE HE WENT
AND THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MERITED IT FROM HIM BY GIVING HIM MY COMPANY SO ENTIRELY AS I HAD DONE AFTER THIS HE MADE ME TAKE A MAID AND KEEP HOUSE
THE WINTER BEFORE AND HE CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN HIS COMPANY AND TWO SERVANTS AND LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
I WAS NOT VERY EASY IN THAT PROPOSAL NOT KNOWING WHAT POSTURE I WAS TO LIVE IN THERE OR HOW HE MIGHT USE ME BUT WHILE THIS WAS IN DEBATE
WHEN I HAD DONE SO HE MADE ME PUT THEM INTO MY LAP AND TOOK MY LITTLE DRAWER
THE PORT WHITHER SHE WAS BOUND WAS TO BRISTOL WHERE MY BROTHER'S CHIEF CORRESPONDENT LIVED I GOT TO LONDON IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS WHERE I HEARD A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT THE SHIP WAS ARRIVED IN BRISTOL
BUT I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR IT I WAS NOT NOW AT REDRIFF WHERE IF I HAD SET MYSELF TOLERABLY UP SOME HONEST SEA CAPTAIN OR OTHER MIGHT HAVE TALKED WITH ME UPON THE HONOURABLE TERMS OF MATRIMONY BUT I WAS AT THE BATH
INDEED IF I HAD BEEN HIS WIFE I COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE I SAT UP WITH HIM SO MUCH AND SO OFTEN THAT AT LAST INDEED HE WOULD NOT LET ME SIT UP ANY LONGER AND THEN I GOT A PALLET BED INTO HIS ROOM AND LAY IN IT JUST AT HIS BED'S FEET
SAID I FOR I ASSURE YOU HE BROUGHT ME ALL THE MONEY I SENT HIM FOR AND HERE IT IS SAID I PULLING OUT MY PURSE WITH ABOUT TWELVE GUINEAS IN IT AND ADDED I INTEND YOU SHALL HAVE MOST OF IT BY AND BY HE SEEMED DISTASTED A LITTLE AT HER TALKING
AND THEN REACHING HIS POCKET PULLED OUT A KEY AND BADE ME OPEN A LITTLE WALNUT TREE BOX HE HAD UPON THE TABLE AND BRING HIM SUCH A DRAWER WHICH I DID IN WHICH DRAWER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN GOLD I BELIEVE NEAR TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
HOWEVER AT LAST HE GREW BETTER AND GAVE HOPES THAT HE WOULD RECOVER AS INDEED HE DID THOUGH VERY SLOWLY WERE IT OTHERWISE THAN WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY I SHOULD NOT BE BACKWARD TO DISCLOSE IT
AND COMING INTO THAT ROOM SAID VERY FRANKLY TO HIM SIR IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE LADY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR NO
FOR THOUGH I HAD CONTRACTED SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO CAME TO THE BATH FOR HIS DIVERSION
AND IN A WORD PRESSED ME TO BUY BETTER
AS YOU SHALL HEAR IN ITS TIME I CAME AWAY FOR ENGLAND IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST AFTER I HAD BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN THAT COUNTRY AND NOW A NEW SCENE OF MISFORTUNES ATTENDED ME WHICH PERHAPS FEW WOMEN HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LIFE OF
THAT THOUGH I WAS TO HIM TO MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN IN THE WORLD YET BECAUSE HE LOVED ME HE COULD NOT INJURE ME
IF HE HAD NOT MADE THOSE PROMISES AT ALL SO AFTER A LITTLE STRUGGLE AS I SAID I LAY STILL AND LET HIM COME TO BED WHEN HE WAS THERE HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND SO I LAY ALL NIGHT WITH HIM BUT HE HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH ME OR OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME
THE BREAKING OF HER MAINMAST SHE HAD GREAT DAMAGE ON BOARD AND THAT A GREAT PART OF HER CARGO WAS SPOILED I HAD NOW A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UPON MY HANDS AND A DREADFUL APPEARANCE IT HAD I WAS COME AWAY WITH A KIND OF FINAL FAREWELL
IN NEED OF ANY ASSISTANCE HE HAD BUT ONE THING MORE TO DESIRE OF ME AND THAT WAS THAT I WOULD PROMISE HIM THAT WHEN I WAS ANY WAY STRAITENED OR LIKE TO BE SO I WOULD FRANKLY TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I WOULD MAKE USE OF HIM WITH THE SAME FREEDOM THAT HE MADE THE OFFER
NOT BY A GREAT DEAL WELL THEN HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME PROMISE TO GO AND FETCH HIM ALL THE MONEY I HAD EVERY FARTHING I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER AND FETCHED HIM A LITTLE PRIVATE DRAWER
AS A MAN OF HONOUR AND OF VIRTUE AS WELL AS OF GREAT ESTATE AND INDEED I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF REASON TO SAY SO OF HIM TOO FOR THOUGH WE LODGED BOTH ON A FLOOR AND HE HAD FREQUENTLY COME INTO MY CHAMBER EVEN WHEN I WAS IN BED
LETTING HIM KNOW THAT I WAS STILL WITH HER BUT SHE DENIED IT AND PROTESTED TO ME THAT SHE DID NOT AND HE SAID THE SAME IN A WORD THIS GENTLEMAN CAME DOWN AND CONTINUED TO SINGLE ME OUT FOR HIS PECULIAR CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION
AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
WAS A GREAT WHILE AFTER THIS THAT I HAD OCCASION ON MY OWN BUSINESS TO GO TO BRISTOL UPON WHICH HE HIRED ME A COACH AND WOULD GO WITH ME AND DID SO AND NOW INDEED OUR INTIMACY INCREASED
FOR A WICKED CORRESPONDENCE IF THEY HAD ANY OF THEM OFFERED IT YET THERE WAS ONE GENTLEMAN AS ABOVE WHO ALWAYS SINGLED ME OUT FOR THE DIVERSION OF MY COMPANY AS HE CALLED IT WHICH AS HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HIM BUT AT THAT TIME
WHICH HE WAS SORRY FOR ASSURING ME THAT HE INQUIRED INTO IT WITH NO DESIGN TO SATISFY HIS OWN CURIOSITY BUT MERELY TO ASSIST ME IF THERE WAS ANY OCCASION BUT SINCE I
WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN
HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS MONEY AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE WITH ME AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW BUT I SECURED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD AND LOCKED UP THE LODGINGS AND WENT TO HIM WHERE I FOUND HIM VERY ILL INDEED HOWEVER I PERSUADED HIM TO BE CARRIED
BUT I KNEW NOT HOW MUCH HE TOOK THE DRAWER AND TAKING MY HAND MADE ME PUT IT IN AND TAKE A WHOLE HANDFUL I WAS BACKWARD AT THAT BUT HE HELD MY HAND HARD IN HIS HAND
HE STARTS OUT OF HIS BED AND NOW MY DEAR SAYS HE YOU SHALL SEE HOW JUST I WILL BE TO YOU AND THAT I CAN KEEP MY WORD AND AWAY HE COMES TO MY BED I RESISTED A LITTLE BUT I MUST CONFESS I SHOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED HIM MUCH
AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
AND INDEED FROM THAT TIME I DID NOT APPEAR SO MUCH RESERVED TO HIM AS I HAD DONE BEFORE THOUGH STILL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STRICTEST VIRTUE ON BOTH SIDES BUT HOW FREE SOEVER OUR CONVERSATION WAS I COULD NOT ARRIVE TO THAT SORT OF FREEDOM
AND TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT ME AS LONG AS I LIVED AND THAT IF HE DIED BEFORE ME HE WOULD LEAVE SUFFICIENT TO HIS MOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME STILL IN THE NAME OF A SISTER AND HE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS CAREFUL OF ME WHEN HE HEARD OF ME
HE DECENTLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TILL I WAS IN BED AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE BED ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT LAY THERE TALKING TO ME A GREAT WHILE AT LAST REPEATING HIS USUAL SAYING THAT HE COULD LIE NAKED IN THE BED WITH ME AND NOT OFFER ME THE LEAST INJURY
WE HAD AN INDIFFERENT GOOD VOYAGE TILL WE CAME JUST UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND AND WHERE WE ARRIVED IN TWO AND THIRTY DAYS BUT WERE THEN RUFFLED WITH TWO OR THREE STORMS
AND SHE AGAIN USED TO TELL ME SHE BELIEVED IT WAS SO FROM THE BEGINNING HOWEVER SHE USED TO TELL ME THAT SHE THOUGHT I OUGHT TO EXPECT SOME GRATIFICATION FROM HIM FOR MY COMPANY FOR INDEED HE DID AS IT WERE ENGROSS ME AND I WAS SELDOM FROM HIM
AND CARRY IT ALL HOME INTO MY OWN CHAMBER I RELATE THIS STORY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HUMOUR THERE WAS IN IT AND TO SHOW THE TEMPER WITH WHICH WE CONVERSED
I WAS INDEED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH HIS CONDITION AND WITH THE APPREHENSION OF LOSING SUCH A FRIEND AS HE WAS AND WAS LIKE TO BE TO ME AND I USED TO SIT AND CRY BY HIM MANY HOURS TOGETHER
AND KEPT HIS BED FIVE WEEKS ALL WHICH TIME I NURSED HIM AND TENDED HIM MYSELF
IF I MIGHT BELIEVE HIM WAS TO HIM
AS HE WOULD DEFEND IT IF I WAS ASSAULTED BY A RAVISHER I BELIEVED HIM AND TOLD HIM I DID SO BUT THIS DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WOULD HE SAID
I TOOK THE DIVERSION OF GOING TO THE BATH FOR AS I WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING OLD SO MY HUMOUR WHICH WAS ALWAYS GAY CONTINUED SO TO AN EXTREME AND BEING NOW AS IT WERE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE THOUGH I WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT A FORTUNE
I TOLD HER I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM THE LEAST OCCASION TO THINK I WANTED IT
AT THE WORD SINCERE AND ASKING HIM IF I HAD EVER GIVEN HIM ANY ANSWERS WHICH WERE NOT SINCERE I PROMISED HIM I WOULD WHY THEN HIS REQUEST WAS HE SAID TO LET HIM SEE MY PURSE
ADDING THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS FIND I HAD A TRUE FRIEND THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS AFRAID TO TRUST HIM I OMITTED NOTHING THAT WAS FIT TO BE SAID BY ONE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAD A DUE SENSE OF HIS KINDNESS
AND I ALSO INTO HIS WHEN HE WAS IN BED YET HE NEVER OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME FURTHER THAN A KISS OR SO MUCH AS SOLICITED ME TO ANYTHING TILL LONG AFTER AS YOU SHALL HEAR
AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
AND PERHAPS MAY BE SO TO OTHERS WHO KNOW HOW THE LAWS OF NATURE WORK FOR HE WAS A STRONG VIGOROUS BRISK PERSON NOR DID HE ACT THUS ON A PRINCIPLE OF RELIGION AT ALL BUT OF MERE AFFECTION INSISTING ON IT
THOUGH I WAS SECRETLY VERY GLAD OF HIS OFFER SOME WEEKS PASSED AFTER THIS AND STILL I NEVER ASKED HIM FOR MONEY WHEN MY LANDLADY A CUNNING CREATURE WHO HAD OFTEN PRESSED ME TO IT BUT FOUND THAT I COULD NOT DO IT
BUT ALL ALONG ATTESTED IT TO BE WITH THE UTMOST RESERVE FOR MY VIRTUE AND HIS OWN I TOLD HIM I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF IT HE CARRIED IT THAT LENGTH THAT HE PROTESTED TO ME THAT IF HE WAS NAKED IN BED WITH ME
HERE I SAY I PASSED THE WINTER AS HEAVILY AS I HAD PASSED THE AUTUMN CHEERFULLY
FROM THE DISTURBANCE OF SUCH A MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE AS THAT WAS MY LANDLADY WHO OF HER OWN ACCORD ENCOURAGED THE CORRESPONDENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIM
WHERE I HAD ABOUT SIX GUINEAS MORE AND SOME SILVER AND THREW IT ALL DOWN UPON THE BED AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS ALL MY WEALTH HONESTLY TO A SHILLING HE LOOKED A LITTLE AT IT BUT DID NOT TELL IT
BUT THE MAN YOU SENT TO BRISTOL YESTERDAY FOR MONEY IS COME BACK AND SAYS HE HAS BROUGHT NONE NOW I COULD BY NO MEANS LIKE HER PROJECT
WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
SO I DID NOT FAIL TO LET MY NEW FRIEND KNOW THAT I EXPECTED A SUPPLY FROM THENCE AND SO INDEED I DID AND AS THE SHIPS WENT FROM BRISTOL TO YORK RIVER IN VIRGINIA AND BACK AGAIN GENERALLY IN LESS TIME FROM LONDON
AND THAT I WAITED AT BATH TILL THE NEXT VIRGINIA FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE BY WHICH I EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE EFFECTS I UNDERSTOOD BY HIM AND BY OTHERS OF HIM THAT HE HAD A WIFE BUT THAT THE LADY WAS DISTEMPERED IN HER HEAD AND WAS UNDER THE CONDUCT
THE COMPANY BEGINNING TO WEAR AWAY AT THE BATH HE TALKED OF GOING AWAY
AS IT IS CALLED THERE AND CONTRACTED SOME UNHAPPY ACQUAINTANCES WHICH RATHER PROMPTED THE FOLLIES I FELL AFTERWARDS INTO THAN FORTIFIED ME AGAINST THEM I LIVED PLEASANTLY ENOUGH KEPT GOOD COMPANY THAT IS TO SAY GAY FINE COMPANY
WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT WANT AND I CLEARLY SAW THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY BEING BACKWARD TO ASK SO I TOOK HER UP SHORT
STOOD ON THE TOP DOORSTEP WITH A BUTLER AND FOOTMAN AND A MAID OR SO BEHIND HER AND SHE JUST SAID SO GLAD YOU'VE COME AS IF I'D RUN DOWN TO LUNCH FROM A TOWN TEN MILES AWAY INSTEAD OF HAVING COME HALF THE WORLD OVER AT THE CALL OF TWO URGENT TELEGRAMS
FOR HE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN THE EFFECT EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE THE REASON IS THAT HE ALLOWS HIS UNDERSTANDING TO OVERRULE HIS EYES
I GUESS FLORENCE WANTED TO RAISE THE CULTURE OF THE STUYVESANT CROWD AND DID IT AS SHE MIGHT HAVE GONE IN SLUMMING INTELLECTUAL SLUMMING THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO LEAVE THE WORLD A LITTLE MORE ELEVATED THAN SHE FOUND IT POOR DEAR THING
NOT SO MUCH AS TO CARCASSONNE ITSELF WE TALKED OF IT OF COURSE BUT I GUESS FLORENCE GOT ALL SHE WANTED OUT OF ONE LOOK AT A PLACE SHE HAD THE SEEING EYE I HAVEN'T UNFORTUNATELY SO THAT THE WORLD IS FULL OF PLACES TO WHICH I WANT TO RETURN
AND CHANCING TO WALK NEAR THE COURSE THROUGH WHICH IT PASSED HAS FELT POWERFULLY IN THE SILENCE AND DESERTION OF THE STREETS AND IN THE STAGNATION OF ORDINARY BUSINESS THE DEEP INTEREST WHICH AT THAT MOMENT WAS POSSESSING THE HEART OF MAN
IF ALL AT ONCE HE SHOULD HEAR THE DEATH LIKE STILLNESS BROKEN UP BY THE SOUND OF WHEELS RATTLING AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND MAKING KNOWN THAT THE TRANSITORY VISION WAS DISSOLVED HE WILL BE AWARE THAT AT NO MOMENT
ANATOLE WITH HIS SWAGGERING AIR STRODE UP TO THE WINDOW HE WANTED TO SMASH SOMETHING PUSHING AWAY THE FOOTMEN HE TUGGED AT THE FRAME BUT COULD NOT MOVE IT HE SMASHED A PANE
THE MAN WHO HAD WISHED TO STOP THE AFFAIR RAN TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM AND THREW HIMSELF ON A SOFA WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL PIERRE HID HIS FACE FROM WHICH A FAINT SMILE FORGOT TO FADE THOUGH HIS FEATURES NOW EXPRESSED HORROR AND FEAR ALL WERE STILL
AND DISSATISFIED BY ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SINCE DONE IN THAT LINE ALL OTHER MURDERS LOOK PALE BY THE DEEP CRIMSON OF HIS AND AS AN AMATEUR ONCE SAID TO ME IN A QUERULOUS TONE
ANATOLE BROUGHT TWO CANDLES AND PLACED THEM ON THE WINDOW SILL THOUGH IT WAS ALREADY QUITE LIGHT DOLOKHOV'S BACK IN HIS WHITE SHIRT AND HIS CURLY HEAD WERE LIT UP FROM BOTH SIDES EVERYONE CROWDED TO THE WINDOW THE ENGLISHMAN IN FRONT
WHICH WILL CREATE A HELL WITHIN HIM AND INTO THIS HELL WE ARE TO LOOK FOOTNOTE ONE
IT SEEMS ALMOST LUDICROUS TO GUARD AND EXPLAIN MY USE OF A WORD IN A SITUATION WHERE IT WOULD NATURALLY EXPLAIN ITSELF BUT IT HAS BECOME NECESSARY TO DO SO IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNSCHOLARLIKE USE OF THE WORD SYMPATHY
HE GAVE AN ORANGE EVERY MORNING AND THEY LASTED HIM RIGHT ROUND THE GIRDLE OF THIS MIGHTY GLOBE OF OURS WHEN THEY WERE AT NORTH CAPE EVEN HE SAW ON THE HORIZON POOR DEAR THIN MAN THAT HE WAS A LIGHTHOUSE
AND I AGAIN SET MYSELF TO STUDY THE PROBLEM AT LENGTH I SOLVED IT TO MY OWN SATISFACTION AND MY SOLUTION IS THIS MURDER
THE ENGLISHMAN TOOK OUT HIS PURSE AND BEGAN COUNTING OUT THE MONEY DOLOKHOV STOOD FROWNING AND DID NOT SPEAK PIERRE JUMPED UPON THE WINDOW SILL GENTLEMEN
LOOKING FROM UNDER HIS BROWS AT THE TIPSY GUESTS WHO WERE AGAIN CROWDING ROUND THE WINDOW AND LISTENING TO THEIR CHATTER ANATOLE KEPT ON REFILLING PIERRE'S GLASS WHILE EXPLAINING THAT DOLOKHOV WAS BETTING WITH STEVENS AN ENGLISH NAVAL OFFICER
BUT THOUGH IN MACBETH THE STRIFE OF MIND IS GREATER THAN IN HIS WIFE THE TIGER SPIRIT NOT SO AWAKE AND HIS FEELINGS CAUGHT CHIEFLY BY CONTAGION FROM HER
AND THE IMMENSE MISTRAL BLEW DOWN THAT VALLEY WHICH WAS THE WAY FROM FRANCE INTO PROVENCE SO THAT THE SILVER GREY OLIVE LEAVES APPEARED LIKE HAIR FLYING IN THE WIND
THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DOING SINCE HIS TIME OR NOTHING THAT'S WORTH SPEAKING OF BUT THIS IS WRONG FOR IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT ALL MEN TO BE GREAT ARTISTS AND BORN WITH THE GENIUS OF MISTER WILLIAMS
AND THE TUFTS OF ROSEMARY CREPT INTO THE IRON ROCKS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE TORN UP BY THE ROOTS IT WAS OF COURSE POOR DEAR FLORENCE WHO WANTED TO GO TO LAS TOURS
THE FACT IS THAT THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WEAK AND FLUTTERING HEART DIDN'T WANT HIS FACTORY TO MANUFACTURE ANYTHING AT ALL HE WANTED TO RETIRE AND HE DID RETIRE WHEN HE WAS SEVENTY BUT HE WAS SO WORRIED AT HAVING ALL THE STREET BOYS IN THE TOWN POINT AFTER HIM AND EXCLAIM
AND WE DESCENDED ON IT FROM THE HIGH CLEAR WINDSWEPT WASTE OF THE NEW FOREST I TELL YOU IT WAS AMAZING TO ARRIVE THERE FROM WATERBURY AND IT CAME INTO MY HEAD
TOWNS WITH THE BLINDING WHITE SUN UPON THEM STONE PINES AGAINST THE BLUE OF THE SKY CORNERS OF GABLES ALL CARVED AND PAINTED WITH STAGS AND SCARLET FLOWERS AND CROWSTEPPED GABLES WITH THE LITTLE SAINT AT THE TOP
THE ANIMAL'S ACTION ITS HIGH STEPPING ITS SKIN THAT WAS LIKE SATIN AND THE PEACE AND THE RED CHEEKS AND THE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL OLD HOUSE JUST NEAR BRANSHAW TELERAGH IT WAS
YET HOWEVER OBSTINATELY I ENDEAVORED WITH MY UNDERSTANDING TO COMPREHEND THIS FOR MANY YEARS I NEVER COULD SEE WHY IT SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH AN EFFECT HERE I PAUSE FOR ONE MOMENT TO EXHORT THE READER
IN WHICH NOT ONLY THE UNDERSTANDING IS ALLOWED TO OVERRULE THE EYES BUT WHERE THE UNDERSTANDING IS POSITIVELY ALLOWED TO OBLITERATE THE EYES AS IT WERE
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED SUDDENLY DOLOKHOV MADE A BACKWARD MOVEMENT WITH HIS SPINE AND HIS ARM TREMBLED NERVOUSLY THIS WAS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE HIS WHOLE BODY TO SLIP AS HE SAT ON THE SLOPING LEDGE AS HE BEGAN SLIPPING DOWN
AND MADE SENSIBLE ANOTHER WORLD HAS STEPPED IN
WHICH IS IN THE BLACK MOUNTAINS IN THE MIDDLE OF A TORTUOUS VALLEY THERE RISES UP AN IMMENSE PINNACLE AND ON THE PINNACLE ARE FOUR CASTLES LAS TOURS THE TOWERS
AND THE MOST TO BE DISTRUSTED AND YET THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE TRUST TO NOTHING ELSE WHICH MAY DO FOR ORDINARY LIFE BUT NOT FOR PHILOSOPHICAL PURPOSES OF THIS OUT OF TEN THOUSAND INSTANCES THAT I MIGHT PRODUCE
OVER THE RHONE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT BEAUCAIRE WE NEVER DID TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT BEAUCAIRE OF COURSE BEAUTIFUL BEAUCAIRE WITH THE HIGH TRIANGULAR WHITE TOWER THAT LOOKED AS THIN AS A NEEDLE AND AS TALL AS THE FLATIRON BETWEEN FIFTH AND BROADWAY
FIFTY REPLIED THE LATTER ALL RIGHT FIFTY IMPERIALS THAT I WILL DRINK A WHOLE BOTTLE OF RUM WITHOUT TAKING IT FROM MY MOUTH SITTING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW ON THIS SPOT
EXHIBITS HUMAN NATURE IN ITS MOST ABJECT AND HUMILIATING ATTITUDE SUCH AN ATTITUDE WOULD LITTLE SUIT THE PURPOSES OF THE POET WHAT THEN MUST HE DO HE MUST THROW THE INTEREST ON THE MURDERER
BENEATH THE TALLNESS OF THE STONE PINES WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING THE STONE PINE IS NO WE NEVER DID GO BACK ANYWHERE NOT TO HEIDELBERG NOT TO HAMELIN NOT TO VERONA NOT TO MONT MAJOUR
FOR NINE MONTHS OR SO IT WOULD MANUFACTURE BUTTONS OUT OF BONE THEN IT WOULD SUDDENLY PRODUCE BRASS BUTTONS FOR COACHMEN'S LIVERIES THEN IT WOULD TAKE A TURN AT EMBOSSED TIN LIDS FOR CANDY BOXES
BUT IN THE MURDERER SUCH A MURDERER AS A POET WILL CONDESCEND TO THERE MUST BE RAGING SOME GREAT STORM OF PASSION JEALOUSY AMBITION VENGEANCE HATRED
IN FACT MY UNDERSTANDING SAID POSITIVELY THAT IT COULD NOT PRODUCE ANY EFFECT BUT I KNEW BETTER I FELT THAT IT DID AND I WAITED AND CLUNG TO THE PROBLEM UNTIL FURTHER KNOWLEDGE SHOULD ENABLE ME TO SOLVE IT
AND IT STRUCK HIM THAT THE THINGS TO TAKE FOR THAT PURPOSE WERE ORANGES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THE ORANGE COUNTRY AND COMFORTABLE FOLDING CHAIRS SO HE BOUGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CASES OF ORANGES THE GREAT COOL CALIFORNIA ORANGES
HAIL STORM AND THUNDER WHICH ARE TO BE STUDIED WITH ENTIRE SUBMISSION OF OUR OWN FACULTIES AND IN THE PERFECT FAITH THAT IN THEM THERE CAN BE NO TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE NOTHING USELESS OR INERT
HIS HEAD AND ARM WAVERED STILL MORE WITH THE STRAIN ONE HAND MOVED AS IF TO CLUTCH THE WINDOW SILL BUT REFRAINED FROM TOUCHING IT PIERRE AGAIN COVERED HIS EYES AND THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER OPEN THEM AGAIN SUDDENLY HE WAS AWARE OF A STIR ALL AROUND HE LOOKED UP
EMOTIONS WERE REALLY STIRRED HER LITTLE HEART MIGHT CEASE TO BEAT FOR TWELVE YEARS I HAD TO WATCH EVERY WORD THAT ANY PERSON UTTERED IN ANY CONVERSATION AND I HAD TO HEAD IT OFF WHAT THE ENGLISH CALL THINGS OFF LOVE POVERTY CRIME
BENEATH THE HIGH THIN LEAVED ELMS THE FIRST QUESTION THEY ASKED ME WAS NOT HOW I DID BUT WHAT DID I DO AND I DID NOTHING
HIS UNDERSTANDING WHICH INCLUDES NO INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAWS OF VISION CAN FURNISH HIM WITH NO REASON WHY A LINE WHICH IS KNOWN AND CAN BE PROVED TO BE A HORIZONTAL LINE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A HORIZONTAL LINE
AND GREY AND PINK PALAZZI AND WALLED TOWNS A MILE OR SO BACK FROM THE SEA ON THE MEDITERRANEAN BETWEEN LEGHORN AND NAPLES NOT ONE OF THEM DID WE SEE MORE THAN ONCE
THAT A STORY YOU HAVEN'T AN IDEA OF THE QUEER OLD FASHIONEDNESS OF FLORENCE'S AUNTS THE MISSES HURLBIRD NOR YET OF HER UNCLE AN EXTRAORDINARILY LOVABLE MAN THAT UNCLE JOHN
A THIN YOUNG LAD AN HUSSAR OF THE LIFE GUARDS WHO HAD BEEN LOSING THAT EVENING CLIMBED ON THE WINDOW SILL LEANED OVER AND LOOKED DOWN OH OH OH HE MUTTERED
I'LL DRINK IT LET'S HAVE A BOTTLE OF RUM SHOUTED PIERRE BANGING THE TABLE WITH A DETERMINED AND DRUNKEN GESTURE AND PREPARING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE WINDOW
I HAVE HEARD HER LECTURE TEDDY ASHBURNHAM BY THE HOUR ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FRANZ HALS AND A WOUVERMANS AND WHY THE PRE MYCENAEAN STATUES WERE CUBICAL WITH KNOBS ON THE TOP I WONDER WHAT HE MADE OF IT PERHAPS HE WAS THANKFUL
ON WHICH MURDERS BY THE WAY I MUST OBSERVE THAT IN ONE RESPECT THEY HAVE HAD AN ILL EFFECT BY MAKING THE CONNOISSEUR IN MURDER VERY FASTIDIOUS IN HIS TASTE
THE LINES OF THAT MOUTH WERE REMARKABLY FINELY CURVED THE MIDDLE OF THE UPPER LIP FORMED A SHARP WEDGE AND CLOSED FIRMLY ON THE FIRM LOWER ONE
UNLESS THE PERSON HAS HAPPENED TO OBSERVE IN PICTURES HOW IT IS THAT ARTISTS PRODUCE THESE EFFECTS HE WILL BE UTTERLY UNABLE TO MAKE THE SMALLEST APPROXIMATION TO IT YET WHY
DOLOKHOV CLIMBED CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY THROUGH THE WINDOW AND LOWERED HIS LEGS PRESSING AGAINST BOTH SIDES OF THE WINDOW HE ADJUSTED HIMSELF ON HIS SEAT
THIN GENTLE AND WITH A HEART THAT MADE HIS LIFE VERY MUCH WHAT FLORENCE'S AFTERWARDS BECAME HE DIDN'T RESIDE AT STAMFORD HIS HOME WAS IN WATERBURY WHERE THE WATCHES COME FROM
WHY IT IS NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS IN PROVENCE AND THEN WE SHALL COME BACK TO THE FIRESIDE WITH JUST THE TOUCH OF A SIGH BECAUSE WE ARE NOT IN THAT PROVENCE WHERE EVEN THE SADDEST STORIES ARE GAY CONSIDER THE LAMENTABLE HISTORY OF PEIRE VIDAL
THEY ARE TRANSFIGURED LADY MACBETH IS UNSEXED MACBETH HAS FORGOT THAT HE WAS BORN OF WOMAN BOTH ARE CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF DEVILS AND THE WORLD OF DEVILS IS SUDDENLY REVEALED
FIFTY IMPERIALS HE SPOKE FRENCH THAT THE ENGLISHMAN MIGHT UNDERSTAND HIM BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK IT VERY WELL I BET FIFTY IMPERIALS OR DO YOU WISH TO MAKE IT A HUNDRED ADDED HE ADDRESSING THE ENGLISHMAN NO
HE DESIRED SO PASSIONATELY ONCE MORE TO ENJOY THAT DISSIPATION HE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THAT HE DECIDED TO GO THE THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HIS PROMISE TO PRINCE ANDREW WAS OF NO ACCOUNT
OR SOME PROVISION OR PRINCIPLE OF THE CONSTITUTION STOOD IN THE WAY OR THEY MAY WITHOUT ANY SUCH QUESTION HAVE VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION ON WHAT APPEARED TO THEM TO BE SUFFICIENT GROUNDS OF EXPEDIENCY
NOR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION
AS THE FIRST THING TO BE ATTENDED TO INDEED SUCH CONDEMNATION OF US SEEMS TO BE AN INDISPENSABLE PREREQUISITE LICENSE SO TO SPEAK AMONG YOU TO BE ADMITTED OR PERMITTED TO SPEAK AT ALL NOW CAN YOU OR NOT
WHICH PROVIDES THAT NO PERSON SHALL BE DEPRIVED OF LIFE LIBERTY OR PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW WHILE SENATOR DOUGLAS AND HIS PECULIAR ADHERENTS PLANT THEMSELVES UPON THE TENTH AMENDMENT
IN THE INSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ACTED UPON THE QUESTION BUT FOR WHAT REASONS THEY SO VOTED IS NOT KNOWN
AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW IT IS THIS DOES THE PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION FORBID OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN OUR FEDERAL TERRITORIES
IN BOTH DEEDS OF CESSION IT WAS MADE A CONDITION BY THE CEDING STATES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT PROHIBIT SLAVERY IN THE CEDED COUNTRY BESIDES THIS SLAVERY WAS THEN ACTUALLY IN THE CEDED COUNTRY
THIS ACT PASSED BOTH BRANCHES OF CONGRESS WITHOUT YEAS AND NAYS IN THAT CONGRESS WERE THREE OF THE THIRTY NINE WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION THEY WERE JOHN LANGDON GEORGE READ AND ABRAHAM BALDWIN
NO LINE DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY NOR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION WAS VIOLATED BY CONGRESS PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY WHILE MISTER PINCKNEY
THEY ALL PROBABLY VOTED FOR IT CERTAINLY THEY WOULD HAVE PLACED THEIR OPPOSITION TO IT UPON RECORD IF IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING ANY LINE DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION
ACCORDING TO THE PRACTICE OF OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE NOT ONE OF ALL YOUR VARIOUS PLANS CAN SHOW A PRECEDENT OR AN ADVOCATE IN THE CENTURY WITHIN WHICH OUR GOVERNMENT ORIGINATED CONSIDER THEN
NO ONE WHO HAS SWORN TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION CAN CONSCIENTIOUSLY VOTE FOR WHAT HE UNDERSTANDS TO BE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEASURE HOWEVER EXPEDIENT HE MAY THINK IT BUT ONE MAY AND OUGHT TO VOTE AGAINST A MEASURE
PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY AND I MIGHT ALMOST SAY PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST HALF OF THE PRESENT CENTURY DECLARE THAT IN HIS UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION
THE FACTS WITH WHICH I SHALL DEAL THIS EVENING ARE MAINLY OLD AND FAMILIAR NOR IS THERE ANYTHING NEW IN THE GENERAL USE I SHALL MAKE OF THEM IF THERE SHALL BE ANY NOVELTY
THE SAME QUESTION OF PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORY AGAIN CAME BEFORE THE CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATION AND TWO MORE OF THE THIRTY NINE WHO AFTERWARD SIGNED THE CONSTITUTION WERE IN THAT CONGRESS AND VOTED ON THE QUESTION
HAD UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IN PROGRESS TOWARD MATURITY THESE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND THIS ACT PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN ALL THE TERRITORY THE NATION THEN OWNED THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WERE INTRODUCED BEFORE
AND A PART OF IT AT LEAST IS TRUE A PLOT FOR AN UPRISING COULD SCARCELY BE DEVISED AND COMMUNICATED TO TWENTY INDIVIDUALS BEFORE SOME ONE OF THEM TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A FAVORITE MASTER OR MISTRESS WOULD DIVULGE IT
PROPERLY FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY THE OTHER OF THE FOUR JAMES MC HENRY VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION SHOWING THAT FOR SOME CAUSE HE THOUGHT IT IMPROPER TO VOTE FOR IT
UNDERSTOOD WHETHER THEY REALLY WERE INCONSISTENT BETTER THAN WE BETTER THAN HE WHO AFFIRMS THAT THEY ARE INCONSISTENT IT IS SURELY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THE THIRTY NINE FRAMERS OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION
AND ESPECIALLY FOR PERSISTING IN THE ASSERTION AFTER YOU HAVE TRIED AND FAILED TO MAKE THE PROOF YOU NEED NOT BE TOLD THAT PERSISTING IN A CHARGE WHICH ONE DOES NOT KNOW TO BE TRUE IS SIMPLY MALICIOUS SLANDER
THEY WERE WILLIAM BLOUNT AND WILLIAM FEW AND THEY BOTH VOTED FOR THE PROHIBITION THUS SHOWING THAT IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING NO LINE DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY NOR ANYTHING ELSE
I DO NOT THINK A GENERAL OR EVEN A VERY EXTENSIVE SLAVE INSURRECTION IS POSSIBLE THE INDISPENSABLE CONCERT OF ACTION CANNOT BE ATTAINED THE SLAVES HAVE NO MEANS OF RAPID COMMUNICATION NOR CAN INCENDIARY FREEMEN BLACK OR WHITE SUPPLY IT
ENFORCING THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN THE NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY NOT ONLY WAS IT THE SAME CONGRESS BUT THEY WERE THE IDENTICAL SAME INDIVIDUAL MEN WHO AT THE SAME SESSION AND AT THE SAME TIME WITHIN THE SESSION
OR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION FORBIDS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES HE IS RIGHT TO SAY SO AND TO ENFORCE HIS POSITION BY ALL TRUTHFUL EVIDENCE AND FAIR ARGUMENT WHICH HE CAN
THE TRUE NUMBER OF THOSE OF THE THIRTY NINE WHOM I HAVE SHOWN TO HAVE ACTED UPON THE QUESTION WHICH BY THE TEXT THEY UNDERSTOOD BETTER THAN WE IS TWENTY THREE LEAVING SIXTEEN NOT SHOWN TO HAVE ACTED UPON IT IN ANY WAY
DECLARED THAT IN HIS UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES I GO A STEP FURTHER
WE SHOULD DO SO UPON EVIDENCE SO CONCLUSIVE AND ARGUMENT SO CLEAR THAT EVEN THEIR GREAT AUTHORITY
IN A MORE MARKED AND EXTENSIVE WAY THAN THEY DID IN THE CASE OF MISSISSIPPI THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PROVISION THEREIN MADE IN RELATION TO SLAVES WAS FIRST THAT NO SLAVE SHOULD BE IMPORTED INTO THE TERRITORY FROM FOREIGN PARTS
LESS THAN EIGHT YEARS BEFORE WASHINGTON GAVE THAT WARNING HE HAD AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES APPROVED AND SIGNED AN ACT OF CONGRESS ENFORCING THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN THE NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY
THE IDENTICAL OLD POLICY ON THE POINT IN CONTROVERSY WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WHILE YOU WITH ONE ACCORD REJECT AND SCOUT AND SPIT UPON THAT OLD POLICY AND INSIST UPON SUBSTITUTING SOMETHING NEW
IN EIGHTEEN O THREE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PURCHASED THE LOUISIANA COUNTRY OUR FORMER TERRITORIAL ACQUISITIONS CAME FROM CERTAIN OF OUR OWN STATES BUT THIS LOUISIANA COUNTRY WAS ACQUIRED FROM A FOREIGN NATION
IS IT NOT A LITTLE PRESUMPTUOUS IN ANY ONE AT THIS DAY TO AFFIRM THAT THE TWO THINGS WHICH THAT CONGRESS DELIBERATELY FRAMED
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CONGRESS ON TAKING CHARGE OF THESE COUNTRIES DID NOT ABSOLUTELY PROHIBIT SLAVERY WITHIN THEM BUT THEY DID INTERFERE WITH IT TAKE CONTROL OF IT EVEN THERE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
IT IS ALMOST EXACTLY TRUE TO SAY THEY FRAMED IT AND IT IS ALTOGETHER TRUE TO SAY THEY FAIRLY REPRESENTED THE OPINION AND SENTIMENT OF THE WHOLE NATION AT THAT TIME THEIR NAMES BEING FAMILIAR TO NEARLY ALL AND ACCESSIBLE TO QUITE ALL
AND ACT AS THEY ACTED UPON IT THIS IS ALL REPUBLICANS ASK ALL REPUBLICANS DESIRE IN RELATION TO SLAVERY AS THOSE FATHERS MARKED IT SO LET IT BE AGAIN MARKED AS AN EVIL NOT TO BE EXTENDED
WHICH ACT EMBODIED THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT UPON THAT SUBJECT UP TO AND AT THE VERY MOMENT HE PENNED THAT WARNING AND ABOUT ONE YEAR AFTER HE PENNED IT HE WROTE LA FAYETTE THAT HE CONSIDERED THAT PROHIBITION A WISE MEASURE EXPRESSING IN THE SAME CONNECTION
THAT FAULT IS PRIMARILY YOURS
WHETHER YOUR CLAIM OF CONSERVATISM FOR YOURSELVES AND YOUR CHARGE OF DESTRUCTIVENESS AGAINST US ARE BASED ON THE MOST CLEAR AND STABLE FOUNDATIONS AGAIN YOU SAY WE HAVE MADE THE SLAVERY QUESTION MORE PROMINENT THAN IT FORMERLY WAS
CONGRESS ORGANIZED THE TERRITORY OF MISSISSIPPI IN THE ACT OF ORGANIZATION THEY PROHIBITED THE BRINGING OF SLAVES INTO THE TERRITORY FROM ANY PLACE WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES BY FINE AND GIVING FREEDOM TO SLAVES SO BROUGHT
AND PASSED AFTER THE ACT ENFORCING THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN SO THAT DURING THE WHOLE PENDENCY OF THE ACT TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WERE ALSO PENDING THE SEVENTY SIX MEMBERS OF THAT CONGRESS
NEED NOT NOW BE REPEATED I TAKE THESE THIRTY NINE FOR THE PRESENT AS BEING OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WHAT IS THE QUESTION WHICH ACCORDING TO THE TEXT THOSE FATHERS UNDERSTOOD JUST AS WELL
THOSE WHO NOW INSIST THAT FEDERAL CONTROL OF SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORIES VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION POINT US TO THE PROVISIONS WHICH THEY SUPPOSE IT THUS VIOLATES AND AS I UNDERSTAND
AS TO MAKE THEM GUILTY OF GROSS POLITICAL IMPROPRIETY AND WILFUL PERJURY IF IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION BETWEEN LOCAL AND FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES AND SWORN TO SUPPORT
AND IF THEY DID HOW THEY ACTED UPON IT HOW THEY EXPRESSED THAT BETTER UNDERSTANDING IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THREE YEARS BEFORE THE CONSTITUTION
AS NO BETTER THAN OUTLAWS YOU WILL GRANT A HEARING TO PIRATES OR MURDERERS BUT NOTHING LIKE IT TO BLACK REPUBLICANS IN ALL YOUR CONTENTIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER EACH OF YOU DEEMS AN UNCONDITIONAL CONDEMNATION OF BLACK REPUBLICANISM
ELSE BOTH THEIR FIDELITY TO CORRECT PRINCIPLES AND THEIR OATH TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION WOULD HAVE CONSTRAINED THEM TO OPPOSE THE PROHIBITION AGAIN GEORGE WASHINGTON ANOTHER OF THE THIRTY NINE
NO GREAT WHILE AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION NORTH CAROLINA CEDED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE COUNTRY NOW CONSTITUTING THE STATE OF TENNESSEE AND A FEW YEARS LATER GEORGIA CEDED THAT WHICH NOW CONSTITUTES THE STATES OF MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA
BRAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DECLARING THAT IN HIS OPINION HE UNDERSTANDS THEIR PRINCIPLES BETTER THAN THEY DID THEMSELVES AND ESPECIALLY SHOULD HE NOT SHIRK THAT RESPONSIBILITY BY ASSERTING THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION JUST AS WELL
WHAT HAS BEEN WILL BE AGAIN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS IF YOU WOULD HAVE THE PEACE OF THE OLD TIMES READOPT THE PRECEPTS AND POLICY OF THE OLD TIMES YOU CHARGE THAT WE STIR UP INSURRECTIONS AMONG YOUR SLAVES WE DENY IT
ARE RESERVED TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY OR TO THE PEOPLE NOW IT SO HAPPENS THAT THESE AMENDMENTS WERE FRAMED BY THE FIRST CONGRESS WHICH SAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION THE IDENTICAL CONGRESS WHICH PASSED THE ACT ALREADY MENTIONED
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE BY THE FIRST CONGRESS WHICH SAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AN ACT WAS PASSED TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN INCLUDING THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN THE NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY
THAT WE REPEL YOU BY SOME WRONG PRINCIPLE OR PRACTICE IF WE DO REPEL YOU BY ANY WRONG PRINCIPLE OR PRACTICE THE FAULT IS OURS
SOME OF YOU ADMIT THAT NO REPUBLICAN DESIGNEDLY AIDED OR ENCOURAGED THE HARPER'S FERRY AFFAIR BUT STILL INSIST THAT OUR DOCTRINES AND DECLARATIONS NECESSARILY LEAD TO SUCH RESULTS WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT
TO ENUMERATE THE PERSONS WHO THUS ACTED AS BEING FOUR IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR TWO IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SEVENTEEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE
WE KNOW WE HOLD TO NO DOCTRINE AND MAKE NO DECLARATION WHICH WERE NOT HELD TO AND MADE BY OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE YOU NEVER DEALT FAIRLY BY US IN RELATION TO THIS AFFAIR WHEN IT OCCURRED
UPON THIS SENATOR DOUGLAS HOLDS THE AFFIRMATIVE AND REPUBLICANS THE NEGATIVE THIS AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL FORM AN ISSUE AND THIS ISSUE THIS QUESTION IS PRECISELY WHAT THE TEXT DECLARES OUR FATHERS UNDERSTOOD
IN THE LANGUAGE OF MISTER JEFFERSON UTTERED MANY YEARS AGO IT IS STILL IN OUR POWER TO DIRECT THE PROCESS OF EMANCIPATION AND DEPORTATION PEACEABLY
SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA I COULD HARDLY KEEP MY COUNTENANCE
THIS HAS BEEN MY MOTIVE MY FAIR COUSIN AND I FLATTER MYSELF IT WILL NOT SINK ME IN YOUR ESTEEM AND NOW NOTHING REMAINS FOR ME BUT TO ASSURE YOU IN THE MOST ANIMATED LANGUAGE OF THE VIOLENCE OF MY AFFECTION TO FORTUNE I AM PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT
VERY UNWELL THIS MORNING WHICH I SUPPOSE IS TO BE IMPUTED TO MY GETTING WET THROUGH YESTERDAY MY KIND FRIENDS WILL NOT HEAR OF MY RETURNING TILL I AM BETTER THEY INSIST ALSO ON MY SEEING MISTER JONES
I SHALL CHOOSE TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO YOUR WISH OF INCREASING MY LOVE BY SUSPENSE ACCORDING TO THE USUAL PRACTICE OF ELEGANT FEMALES I DO ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I HAVE NO PRETENSIONS WHATEVER TO THAT KIND OF ELEGANCE WHICH CONSISTS IN TORMENTING A RESPECTABLE MAN
BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS A PALTRY DEVICE A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
MY REASONS FOR BELIEVING IT ARE BRIEFLY THESE IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT MY HAND IS UNWORTHY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OR THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT I CAN OFFER WOULD BE ANY OTHER THAN HIGHLY DESIRABLE
SHE WILL BE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF AS LONG AS SHE STAYS THERE IT IS ALL VERY WELL I WOULD GO AND SEE HER IF I COULD HAVE THE CARRIAGE ELIZABETH FEELING REALLY ANXIOUS WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO HER THOUGH THE CARRIAGE WAS NOT TO BE HAD AND AS SHE WAS NO HORSEWOMAN
THAT I HAVE YOUR RESPECTED MOTHER'S PERMISSION FOR THIS ADDRESS YOU CAN HARDLY DOUBT THE PURPORT OF MY DISCOURSE HOWEVER YOUR NATURAL DELICACY MAY LEAD YOU TO DISSEMBLE MY ATTENTIONS HAVE BEEN TOO MARKED TO BE MISTAKEN
WITH A RENEWAL OF TENDERNESS HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO HER ROOM ON LEAVING THE DINING PARLOUR AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING
YES BUT AS IT HAPPENS THEY ARE ALL OF THEM VERY CLEVER THIS IS THE ONLY POINT I FLATTER MYSELF ON WHICH WE DO NOT AGREE I HAD HOPED THAT OUR SENTIMENTS COINCIDED IN EVERY PARTICULAR BUT I MUST SO FAR DIFFER FROM YOU
WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE ARE MANY AMIABLE YOUNG WOMEN BUT THE FACT IS THAT BEING AS I AM TO INHERIT THIS ESTATE AFTER THE DEATH OF YOUR HONOURED FATHER WHO HOWEVER MAY LIVE MANY YEARS LONGER
THE NEXT DAY OPENED A NEW SCENE AT LONGBOURN MISTER COLLINS MADE HIS DECLARATION IN FORM HAVING RESOLVED TO DO IT WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME AS HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXTENDED ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY
AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE
ELIZABETH ASSURED HIM THAT SHE COULD SUIT HERSELF PERFECTLY WITH THOSE IN THE ROOM I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY
ALL THIS SHE MUST POSSESS ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
DINING OUT SAID MISSUS BENNET THAT IS VERY UNLUCKY CAN I HAVE THE CARRIAGE SAID JANE NO MY DEAR YOU HAD BETTER GO ON HORSEBACK BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKELY TO RAIN AND THEN YOU MUST STAY ALL NIGHT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD SCHEME SAID ELIZABETH
BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY IF THEY HAD UNCLES ENOUGH TO FILL ALL CHEAPSIDE CRIED BINGLEY IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE
AND THEN WALKED TOWARDS THE TABLE WHERE A FEW BOOKS WERE LYING HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
AND HAVING NO FEELINGS OF DIFFIDENCE TO MAKE IT DISTRESSING TO HIMSELF EVEN AT THE MOMENT HE SET ABOUT IT IN A VERY ORDERLY MANNER WITH ALL THE OBSERVANCES WHICH HE SUPPOSED A REGULAR PART OF THE BUSINESS ON FINDING MISSUS BENNET ELIZABETH
SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT I THINK I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT THEIR UNCLE IS AN ATTORNEY IN MERYTON YES
IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT ANOTHER OFFER OF MARRIAGE MAY EVER BE MADE YOU YOUR PORTION IS UNHAPPILY SO SMALL THAT IT WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD UNDO THE EFFECTS OF YOUR LOVELINESS AND AMIABLE QUALIFICATIONS
ON THAT HEAD THEREFORE I SHALL BE UNIFORMLY SILENT AND YOU MAY ASSURE YOURSELF THAT NO UNGENEROUS REPROACH SHALL EVER PASS MY LIPS WHEN WE ARE MARRIED IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO INTERRUPT HIM NOW
BUT LYDIA WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE CONTINUED TO EXPRESS HER ADMIRATION OF CAPTAIN CARTER AND HER HOPE OF SEEING HIM IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AS HE WAS GOING THE NEXT MORNING TO LONDON I AM ASTONISHED MY DEAR SAID MISSUS BENNET
ON THIS SUBJECT AND IT WAS BUT THE VERY SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE I LEFT HUNSFORD BETWEEN OUR POOLS AT QUADRILLE WHILE MISSUS JENKINSON WAS ARRANGING MISS DE BOURGH'S FOOTSTOOL THAT SHE SAID MISTER COLLINS YOU MUST MARRY
ELIZABETH DID NOT QUIT HER ROOM FOR A MOMENT NOR WERE THE OTHER LADIES OFTEN ABSENT THE GENTLEMEN BEING OUT THEY HAD IN FACT NOTHING TO DO ELSEWHERE WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK THREE ELIZABETH FELT THAT SHE MUST GO AND VERY UNWILLINGLY SAID SO
WHO ARE SO DARING AS TO RISK THEIR HAPPINESS ON THE CHANCE OF BEING ASKED A SECOND TIME I AM PERFECTLY SERIOUS IN MY REFUSAL YOU COULD NOT MAKE ME HAPPY AND I AM CONVINCED THAT I AM THE LAST WOMAN IN THE WORLD WHO COULD MAKE YOU SO NAY
BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO OTHERWISE THAN TO DECLINE THEM I AM NOT NOW TO LEARN REPLIED MISTER COLLINS WITH A FORMAL WAVE OF THE HAND THAT IT IS USUAL WITH YOUNG LADIES TO REJECT THE ADDRESSES OF THE MAN
MISTER BENNET'S PROPERTY CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY IN AN ESTATE OF TWO THOUSAND A YEAR WHICH UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIS DAUGHTERS WAS ENTAILED IN DEFAULT OF HEIRS MALE ON A DISTANT RELATION AND THEIR MOTHER'S FORTUNE
THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY HIS ANXIETY FOR JANE WAS EVIDENT
AND ONE OF THE YOUNGER GIRLS TOGETHER SOON AFTER BREAKFAST HE ADDRESSED THE MOTHER IN THESE WORDS MAY I HOPE MADAM FOR YOUR INTEREST WITH YOUR FAIR DAUGHTER ELIZABETH WHEN I SOLICIT FOR THE HONOUR OF A PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH HER IN THE COURSE OF THIS MORNING
I THOUGHT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET LOOKED REMARKABLY WELL WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM THIS MORNING HER DIRTY PETTICOAT QUITE ESCAPED MY NOTICE YOU OBSERVED IT MISTER DARCY I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE YOUR SISTER MAKE SUCH AN EXHIBITION
LIKE MYSELF TO SET THE EXAMPLE OF MATRIMONY IN HIS PARISH SECONDLY THAT I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WILL ADD VERY GREATLY TO MY HAPPINESS AND THIRDLY WHICH PERHAPS I OUGHT TO HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER
AND IMMEDIATELY AND IN SILENCE WITHDREW DETERMINED IF HE PERSISTED IN CONSIDERING HER REPEATED REFUSALS AS FLATTERING ENCOURAGEMENT TO APPLY TO HER FATHER WHOSE NEGATIVE MIGHT BE UTTERED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE DECISIVE
AS IF THE CREDIT OF MAKING IT RAIN WERE ALL HER OWN TILL THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF ALL THE FELICITY OF HER CONTRIVANCE BREAKFAST WAS SCARCELY OVER WHEN A SERVANT FROM NETHERFIELD BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING NOTE FOR ELIZABETH MY DEAREST LIZZY I FIND MYSELF
IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE ADDED SO MUCH TO IT YOURSELF YOU ARE ALWAYS BUYING BOOKS I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE NEGLECT OF A FAMILY LIBRARY IN SUCH DAYS AS THESE
AND ELIZABETH WAS CONVINCED THAT THEY HELD HER IN CONTEMPT FOR IT SHE WAS RECEIVED HOWEVER VERY POLITELY BY THEM AND IN THEIR BROTHER'S MANNERS THERE WAS SOMETHING BETTER THAN POLITENESS THERE WAS GOOD HUMOUR AND KINDNESS MISTER DARCY SAID VERY LITTLE
CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES OR WHATEVER IT IS ABOVE HER ANKLES IN DIRT AND ALONE QUITE ALONE WHAT COULD SHE MEAN BY IT IT SEEMS TO ME TO SHOW AN ABOMINABLE SORT OF CONCEITED INDEPENDENCE
AND WHEN MISS BINGLEY LEFT THEM TOGETHER COULD ATTEMPT LITTLE BESIDES EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY KINDNESS SHE WAS TREATED WITH ELIZABETH SILENTLY ATTENDED HER WHEN BREAKFAST WAS OVER THEY WERE JOINED BY THE SISTERS
SINCE I AM WELL AWARE THAT IT COULD NOT BE COMPLIED WITH AND THAT ONE THOUSAND POUNDS IN THE FOUR PER CENTS WHICH WILL NOT BE YOURS TILL AFTER YOUR MOTHER'S DECEASE IS ALL THAT YOU MAY EVER BE ENTITLED TO
WALKING WAS HER ONLY ALTERNATIVE SHE DECLARED HER RESOLUTION HOW CAN YOU BE SO SILLY CRIED HER MOTHER AS TO THINK OF SUCH A THING IN ALL THIS DIRT YOU WILL NOT BE FIT TO BE SEEN WHEN YOU GET THERE I SHALL BE VERY FIT TO SEE JANE WHICH IS ALL I WANT
MY CONNECTIONS WITH THE FAMILY OF DE BOURGH AND MY RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR OWN ARE CIRCUMSTANCES HIGHLY IN MY FAVOUR AND YOU SHOULD TAKE IT INTO FURTHER CONSIDERATION THAT IN SPITE OF YOUR MANIFOLD ATTRACTIONS
AND PAY ME THE COMPLIMENT OF BELIEVING WHAT I SAY I WISH YOU VERY HAPPY AND VERY RICH AND BY REFUSING YOUR HAND DO ALL IN MY POWER TO PREVENT YOUR BEING OTHERWISE IN MAKING ME THE OFFER YOU MUST HAVE SATISFIED THE DELICACY OF YOUR FEELINGS WITH REGARD TO MY FAMILY
ON THE FIRST APPLICATION AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE EVEN NOW SAID AS MUCH TO ENCOURAGE MY SUIT AS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TRUE DELICACY OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER REALLY MISTER COLLINS CRIED ELIZABETH WITH SOME WARMTH YOU PUZZLE ME EXCEEDINGLY
THEY WERE WELL SUPPLIED BOTH WITH NEWS AND HAPPINESS BY THE RECENT ARRIVAL OF A MILITIA REGIMENT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS TO REMAIN THE WHOLE WINTER AND MERYTON WAS THE HEADQUARTERS THEIR VISITS TO MISSUS PHILLIPS WERE NOW PRODUCTIVE
AND JANE WHO HAD ONLY BEEN WITHHELD BY THE FEAR OF GIVING ALARM OR INCONVENIENCE FROM EXPRESSING IN HER NOTE HOW MUCH SHE LONGED FOR SUCH A VISIT WAS DELIGHTED AT HER ENTRANCE SHE WAS NOT EQUAL HOWEVER TO MUCH CONVERSATION
I WOULD RATHER BE PAID THE COMPLIMENT OF BEING BELIEVED SINCERE I THANK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR THE HONOUR YOU HAVE DONE ME IN YOUR PROPOSALS BUT TO ACCEPT THEM IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE MY FEELINGS IN EVERY RESPECT FORBID IT CAN I SPEAK PLAINER
HER INQUIRIES AFTER HER SISTER WERE NOT VERY FAVOURABLY ANSWERED MISS BENNET HAD SLEPT ILL AND THOUGH UP WAS VERY FEVERISH AND NOT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE HER ROOM ELIZABETH WAS GLAD TO BE TAKEN TO HER IMMEDIATELY
WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL
AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM HER MANNERS WERE PRONOUNCED TO BE VERY BAD INDEED A MIXTURE OF PRIDE AND IMPERTINENCE SHE HAD NO CONVERSATION NO STYLE NO BEAUTY MISSUS HURST THOUGHT THE SAME AND ADDED
THOUGH AMPLE FOR HER SITUATION IN LIFE COULD BUT ILL SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCY OF HIS HER FATHER HAD BEEN AN ATTORNEY IN MERYTON AND HAD LEFT HER FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS SHE HAD A SISTER MARRIED TO A MISTER PHILLIPS
AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
CONCEIVED A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR THE KING'S ABILITIES AND CHARACTER THE WORLD HE SAID HAD MUCH OVERRATED HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY WHO HAD LESS CAPACITY THAN CHARLES
YET EVEN HIS AFFECTION FOR THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH WAS SUBORDINATE TO ANOTHER FEELING WHICH EARLY BECAME SUPREME IN HIS SOUL WHICH MIXED ITSELF WITH ALL HIS PASSIONS WHICH IMPELLED HIM TO MARVELLOUS ENTERPRISES WHICH SUPPORTED HIM
ONE OF THESE WAS ROGER PALMER EARL OF CASTELMAINE IN IRELAND AND HUSBAND OF THE DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND HIS TITLE HAD NOTORIOUSLY BEEN PURCHASED BY HIS WIFE'S DISHONOUR AND HIS OWN HIS FORTUNE WAS SMALL HIS TEMPER
THIS RECKLESS FACTION WAS STRENGTHENED BY AN IMPORTANT REINFORCEMENT RICHARD TALBOT EARL OF TYRCONNEL THE FIERCEST AND MOST UNCOMPROMISING OF ALL THOSE WHO HATED THE LIBERTIES AND RELIGION OF ENGLAND ARRIVED AT COURT FROM DUBLIN
THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY COMPETENT TO INFLICT WHIPPING NOR HAD THE LAW ASSIGNED A LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF STRIPES BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW CLEARLY WAS THAT NO MISDEMEANOUR SHOULD BE PUNISHED MORE SEVERELY THAN THE MOST ATROCIOUS FELONIES
AND HIS ACCENT WAS THAT OF HIS NATIVE GASCONY BUT HIS STRONG SENSE HIS KEEN PENETRATION AND HIS LIVELY WIT EMINENTLY QUALIFIED HIM FOR HIS POST
THOUGH HE WAS AS YET IN CONFINEMENT ONLY FOR DEBT HE WAS PUT INTO IRONS BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE KING'S BENCH PRISON AND EVEN SO HE WAS WITH DIFFICULTY KEPT IN SAFE CUSTODY THE MASTIFF THAT GUARDED HIS DOOR WAS POISONED
AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO DRAG HIM TO TYBURN ON A SLEDGE
AND EVEN FOR REPRIMANDS FROM VERSAILLES
MERCILESS FLOGGING SOON BECAME AN ORDINARY PUNISHMENT FOR POLITICAL MISDEMEANOURS OF NO VERY AGGRAVATED KIND
INTO WHICH MAN CAN ENTER WITH HIS FELLOW MEN AND OF MAKING INSTITUTIONS TO WHICH IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD LOOK WITH RESPECT AND CONFIDENCE INSTRUMENTS OF FRIGHTFUL WRONG AND OBJECTS OF GENERAL DISTRUST
WHICH IT IS FOR HIS INTEREST TO HIDE TALBOT RAISED BY JAMES TO THE EARLDOM OF TYRCONNEL HAD COMMANDED THE TROOPS IN IRELAND DURING THE NINE MONTHS
WITH THE INSOLENCE OF DESPAIR HE WAS CONVICTED ON BOTH INDICTMENTS HIS OFFENCE THOUGH IN A MORAL LIGHT MURDER OF THE MOST AGGRAVATED KIND WAS IN THE EYE OF THE LAW MERELY A MISDEMEANOUR THE TRIBUNAL HOWEVER
EVEN WHEN HE RENDERED TO HER THOSE SERVICES OF WHICH AT THIS DAY WE FEEL THE HAPPY EFFECTS HER WELFARE WAS NOT HIS CHIEF OBJECT WHATEVER PATRIOTIC FEELING HE HAD WAS FOR HOLLAND
IT WAS HIS CONSOLATION TO CREATE ROUND HIM BY BUILDING PLANTING AND DIGGING A SCENE WHICH MIGHT REMIND HIM OF THE FORMAL PILES OF RED BRICK OF THE LONG CANALS AND OF THE SYMMETRICAL FLOWER BEDS AMIDST WHICH HIS EARLY LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED
IN NORTHUMBERLAND THE TRIUMPH OF SIR JOHN FENWICK A COURTIER WHOSE NAME AFTERWARDS OBTAINED A MELANCHOLY CELEBRITY WAS ATTENDED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EXCITED INTEREST IN LONDON
IMPROVIDENCE AND ECCENTRIC IMPUDENCE HE WAS IN TRUTH ONE OF THE MOST MERCENARY AND CRAFTY OF MANKIND HE WAS NOW NO LONGER YOUNG AND WAS EXPIATING BY SEVERE SUFFERINGS THE DISSOLUTENESS OF HIS YOUTH
BY LAYING THE BLAME OF THE ACCIDENT ON HER MONKEY THESE STORIES WHICH IF THEY HAD BEEN TRUE WOULD NEVER HAVE PASSED THE LIPS OF ANY BUT THE BASEST OF MANKIND WERE PURE INVENTIONS TALBOT WAS SOON FORCED TO OWN THAT THEY WERE SO
HE HAD A GREAT WORK TO DO AND TILL IT WAS DONE NOTHING COULD HARM HIM THEREFORE IT WAS THAT
THE DOORS OF THE PRISON CLOSED UPON HIM DURING MANY MONTHS HE REMAINED IRONED IN THE DARKEST HOLE OF NEWGATE IT WAS SAID THAT IN HIS CELL HE GAVE HIMSELF UP TO MELANCHOLY AND SATE WHOLE DAYS UTTERING DEEP GROANS
BUT AGE AND DISEASE HAD MADE NO ESSENTIAL CHANGE IN HIS CHARACTER AND MANNERS HE STILL WHENEVER HE OPENED HIS MOUTH
HE ALLIED HIMSELF CLOSELY WITH CASTELMAINE DOVER AND ALBEVILLE THESE MEN CALLED WITH ONE VOICE FOR WAR ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH AND THE STATE
ONE OF THEM THE EARL OF HUNTINGDON BITTERLY REPROACHED HIM WITH HAVING DECEIVED THE HOUSES AND DRAWN ON THEM THE GUILT OF SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD THE JUDGES BROWBEAT AND REVILED THE PRISONER WITH AN INTEMPERANCE WHICH
STILL REGARDED HIM AS A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR THESE PEOPLE WELL KNEW THAT IF HE WERE CONVICTED HIS SENTENCE WOULD BE ONE OF EXTREME SEVERITY AND WERE THEREFORE INDEFATIGABLE IN THEIR ENDEAVOURS TO MANAGE AN ESCAPE
A PLEA WAS WANTED WHICH MIGHT JUSTIFY THE DUKE OF YORK IN BREAKING THAT PROMISE OF MARRIAGE BY WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED FROM ANNE HYDE THE LAST PROOF OF FEMALE AFFECTION SUCH A PLEA TALBOT IN CONCERT WITH SOME OF HIS DISSOLUTE COMPANIONS
THOUGH INCLOSED ON EVERY SIDE BY THE FRENCH TERRITORY WAS PROPERLY A FIEF NOT OF THE FRENCH BUT OF THE IMPERIAL CROWN LEWIS WITH THAT OSTENTATIOUS CONTEMPT OF PUBLIC LAW WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM
IF THEY REMINDED HIM LESS OF THE RITES OF THE CHURCH OF ROME HE HAD BEEN HEARD TO UTTER AN OMINOUS GROWL WHEN FIRST HE SAW IN HIS WIFE'S PRIVATE CHAPEL AN ALTAR DECKED AFTER THE ANGLICAN FASHION
WESTMINSTER HALL WAS CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS AMONG WHOM WERE MANY ROMAN CATHOLICS
WHEN HE WAS UNBOUND IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD BORNE AS MUCH AS THE HUMAN FRAME CAN BEAR WITHOUT DISSOLUTION JAMES WAS ENTREATED TO REMIT THE SECOND FLOGGING HIS ANSWER WAS SHORT AND CLEAR HE SHALL GO THROUGH WITH IT IF HE HAS BREATH IN HIS BODY
AS A MAN FIT AND READY FOR THE INFAMOUS SERVICE OF ASSASSINATING THE PROTECTOR SOON AFTER THE RESTORATION TALBOT ATTEMPTED TO OBTAIN THE FAVOUR OF THE ROYAL FAMILY BY A SERVICE MORE INFAMOUS STILL
AND TO CREATE ANOTHER HOLLAND IN COUNTRIES BEYOND THE REACH OF THE TYRANNY OF FRANCE NO OBSTACLE WOULD THEN REMAIN TO CHECK THE PROGRESS OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON A FEW YEARS AND THAT HOUSE MIGHT ADD TO ITS DOMINIONS
HE RECOVERED FROM MALADIES WHICH SEEMED HOPELESS THAT BANDS OF ASSASSINS CONSPIRED IN VAIN AGAINST HIS LIFE THAT THE OPEN SKIFF TO WHICH HE TRUSTED HIMSELF ON A STARLESS NIGHT ON A RAGING OCEAN AND NEAR A TREACHEROUS SHORE
WHICH MIGHT MOVE EVEN A PLACABLE NATURE TO FIERCE AND LASTING RESENTMENT ONE SET OF MEN IN PARTICULAR HAD WITH A BASENESS AND CRUELTY BEYOND ALL EXAMPLE AND ALL DESCRIPTION ATTACKED HIS HONOUR AND HIS LIFE
LEWIS POLITE AND DIGNIFIED PROFUSE AND VOLUPTUOUS FOND OF DISPLAY AND AVERSE FROM DANGER A MUNIFICENT PATRON OF ARTS AND LETTERS AND A CRUEL PERSECUTOR OF CALVINISTS
THE BLOOD RAN DOWN IN RIVULETS FOR A TIME THE CRIMINAL SHOWED A STRANGE CONSTANCY BUT AT LAST HIS STUBBORN FORTITUDE GAVE WAY HIS BELLOWINGS WERE FRIGHTFUL TO HEAR HE SWOONED SEVERAL TIMES BUT THE SCOURGE STILL CONTINUED TO DESCEND
WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF A SENSE OF DUTY THREE GREAT COALITIONS THREE LONG AND BLOODY WARS IN WHICH ALL EUROPE FROM THE VISTULA TO THE WESTERN OCEAN WAS IN ARMS ARE TO BE ASCRIBED TO HIS UNCONQUERABLE ENERGY
TO PAINS SO EXCRUCIATING THAT THEY WITH UNFEIGNED EARNESTNESS BEGGED TO BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL ON CAPITAL CHARGES AND SENT TO THE GALLOWS HAPPILY THE PROGRESS OF THIS GREAT EVIL WAS SPEEDILY STOPPED BY THE REVOLUTION
OCCUPIED ORANGE DISMANTLED THE FORTIFICATIONS AND CONFISCATED THE REVENUES WILLIAM DECLARED ALOUD AT HIS TABLE BEFORE MANY PERSONS THAT HE WOULD MAKE THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING REPENT THE OUTRAGE
FOR HE NEVER BECAME AN ENGLISHMAN HE SAVED ENGLAND IT IS TRUE BUT HE NEVER LOVED HER AND HE NEVER OBTAINED HER LOVE TO HIM SHE WAS ALWAYS A LAND OF EXILE VISITED WITH RELUCTANCE AND QUITTED WITH DELIGHT
TWO BILLS OF INDICTMENT AGAINST HIM FOR PERJURY HAD BEEN FOUND BY THE GRAND JURY OF MIDDLESEX A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE DEATH OF CHARLES SOON AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE ELECTIONS THE TRIAL CAME ON AMONG THE UPPER AND MIDDLE CLASSES
THE WORST FELON COULD ONLY BE HANGED THE JUDGES AS THEY BELIEVED SENTENCED OATES TO BE SCOURGED TO DEATH THAT THE LAW WAS DEFECTIVE IS NOT A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR DEFECTIVE LAWS SHOULD BE ALTERED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND NOT STRAINED BY THE TRIBUNALS
MIGHT PLACE A PRINCE OF HIS FAMILY ON THE THRONE OF POLAND MIGHT BE SOLE MASTER OF EUROPE FROM THE SCYTHIAN DESERTS TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND OF AMERICA FROM REGIONS NORTH OF THE TROPIC OF CANCER
HE WAS SENT TO LONDON CHARGED WITH SEVERAL SPECIAL COMMISSIONS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE HE WAS TO LAY THE GROUND FOR A TREATY OF COMMERCE HE WAS TO ASCERTAIN AND REPORT THE STATE OF THE ENGLISH FLEETS
THE PROLONGED MENTAL AGONY OF THE SUFFERER THE SHAME AND MISERY OF ALL CONNECTED WITH HIM THE STAIN ABIDING EVEN TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION ARE THINGS FAR MORE DREADFUL THAN DEATH ITSELF IN GENERAL IT MAY BE SAFELY AFFIRMED
TO REGIONS SOUTH OF THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN SUCH WAS THE PROSPECT WHICH LAY BEFORE WILLIAM WHEN FIRST HE ENTERED ON PUBLIC LIFE AND WHICH NEVER CEASED TO HAUNT HIM TILL HIS LATEST DAY THE FRENCH MONARCHY
HIS CONTEST WITH LEWIS TRANSFERRED FROM THE FIELD TO THE CABINET WAS SOON EXASPERATED BY A PRIVATE FEUD IN TALENTS TEMPER MANNERS AND OPINIONS THE RIVALS WERE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER
HIS OPINIONS RESPECTING ECCLESIASTICAL POLITY AND MODES OF WORSHIP WERE LATITUDINARIAN HE OWNED THAT EPISCOPACY WAS A LAWFUL AND CONVENIENT FORM OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT BUT HE SPOKE WITH SHARPNESS AND SCORN OF THE BIGOTRY OF THOSE
WHEN IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE STATES GENERAL EXHAUSTED AND DISHEARTENED WERE DESIRIOUS OF REPOSE HIS VOICE WAS STILL AGAINST SHEATHING THE SWORD IF PEACE WAS MADE IT WAS MADE ONLY BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BREATHE INTO OTHER MEN
COULD REALLY BE A COLDHEARTED FARSIGHTED SCHEMING SYCOPHANT YET SUCH A MAN WAS TALBOT IN TRUTH HIS HYPOCRISY WAS OF A FAR HIGHER AND RARER SORT
HE FOUGHT ONE OF THE MOST BLOODY AND OBSTINATE BATTLES OF THAT AGE FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE TREATY OF NIMEGUEN WAS SIGNED
BUT WAS HEARD WITH ATTENTION ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS HE AFFECTED THE CHARACTER OF AN IRISH PATRIOT AND PLEADED WITH GREAT AUDACITY AND SOMETIMES WITH SUCCESS THE CAUSE OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHOSE ESTATES HAD BEEN CONFISCATED HE TOOK CARE HOWEVER
HE LOOKED ROUND FOR SUCCOUR AND LOOKED IN VAIN SPAIN WAS UNNERVED GERMANY DISTRACTED ENGLAND CORRUPTED NOTHING SEEMED LEFT TO THE YOUNG STADTHOLDER BUT TO PERISH SWORD IN HAND
THOUGH PURSUING ONE OBJECT VERY JUDICIOUSLY TOOK DIFFERENT PATHS THEY MADE A PARTITION OF THE COURT BONREPAUX LIVED CHIEFLY WITH ROCHESTER AND ROCHESTER'S ADHERENTS BARILLON'S CONNECTIONS
A SPIRIT AS FIERCE AND DETERMINED AS HIS OWN AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT
GREAT JOY IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE DIVINE JUSTICE HAD OVERTAKEN HIM ENGRAVINGS OF HIM LOOKING OUT FROM THE PILLORY AND WRITHING AT THE CART'S TAIL WERE CIRCULATED ALL OVER EUROPE AND EPIGRAMMATISTS IN MANY LANGUAGES
INFERIOR TO HIM IN STATION BUT FAR SUPERIOR IN ABILITIES BONREPAUX BARILLON WAS NOT WITHOUT PARTS AND POSSESSED IN LARGE MEASURE THE GRACES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH THEN DISTINGUISHED THE FRENCH GENTRY
BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL A ROBIN REDBREAST CAME AS BOLD AS COULD BE AND LIT UPON THE COFFIN AND BEGAN TO SING AND THEN I AM AFRAID THAT I BROKE DOWN
IT IS VERY HARD HAVING ONLY ONE SON TO LOSE HIM THUS BUT GOD'S WILL BE DONE WHO AM I THAT I SHOULD COMPLAIN THE GREAT WHEEL OF FATE
THEY LOOKED VERY WHITE UPON THE BLACK CLOTH THERE WAS A LITTLE HITCH ABOUT GETTING THE COFFIN DOWN INTO THE GRAVE THE NECESSARY ROPES HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN SO WE DREW BACK FROM IT
OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NOW LOST COUNT FELL ALSO DO NOT LET ME HOWEVER BE UNDERSTOOD AS DECRYING OUR MODERN INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTING AS THEY DO THE GATHERED EXPERIENCE OF HUMANITY
UNDEFILED AS YET BY ANY HUMAN SINKS OF SWELTERING HUMANITY I WOULD GO AGAIN WHERE THE WILD GAME WAS BACK TO THE LAND WHEREOF NONE KNOW THE HISTORY BACK TO THE SAVAGES WHOM I LOVE
AND THE FELLOW FELL AT MY FEET AND ROLLED OVER AND OVER WEEPING FOR JOY YOU CARELESS SCOUNDREL I SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE WELL SJAMBOCKED THAT IS HIDED MEANWHILE
HERE A GAIN THERE A LOSS AND NATURE'S GREAT AVERAGE STRUCK ACROSS THE TWO WHEREOF THE SUM TOTAL FORMS ONE OF THE FACTORS IN THAT MIGHTY EQUATION
IT WAS EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN NOW MY DEAR OLD FELLOW BURST OUT SIR HENRY AT LAST I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD I HAVE BEEN OVER SOLOMON'S MOUNTAINS TO FIND YOU
MACUMAZAHN HE HALLOED DON'T YOU KNOW ME BAAS I'M JIM THE HUNTER I LOST THE NOTE YOU GAVE ME TO GIVE TO THE BAAS
AND SO MANY THINGS GOOD BAD AND INDIFFERENT HAD HAPPENED TO ME THE THIRST FOR THE WILDERNESS WAS ON ME I COULD TOLERATE THIS PLACE NO MORE I WOULD GO AND DIE AS I HAD LIVED
SITTING TILL LATE INTO THE NIGHT TO DO IT BY JOVE SAID GEORGE CURTIS WHEN I SHOWED HIM SOME OF THE DIAMONDS WELL AT LEAST YOU HAVE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOUR PAINS BESIDES MY WORTHLESS SELF
APPLIED FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF COURSE THEY HAVE GREAT ADVANTAGES HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE BUT THEN REMEMBER WE BREED THE SICKLY PEOPLE WHO FILL THEM IN A SAVAGE LAND THEY DO NOT EXIST
BEAUTIFULLY SHAVED FROCK COAT FITTING LIKE A GLOVE BRAND NEW EYE GLASS ET CETERA ET CETERA I WENT AND WALKED IN THE PARK WITH HIM WHERE I MET SOME PEOPLE I KNOW AND AT ONCE TOLD THEM THE STORY OF HIS BEAUTIFUL WHITE LEGS
GEORGE CURTIS TOLD US HIS STORY WHICH IN ITS WAY WAS ALMOST AS EVENTFUL AS OUR OWN AND PUT SHORTLY AMOUNTED TO THIS A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO YEARS BEFORE HE HAD STARTED FROM SITANDA'S KRAAL
THAT IT IS THE FITTEST BEGINNING TO THE HISTORY THAT I AM ABOUT TO WRITE IF IT PLEASE GOD TO SPARE ME TO FINISH IT IF NOT WELL IT DOES NOT MATTER THAT EXTRACT WAS PENNED SEVEN THOUSAND MILES OR SO
EVEN AS I SAID IT THE DOOR OF THE HUT OPENED AND THERE LIMPED OUT OF IT A WHITE MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND WITH AN ENORMOUS BLACK BEARD I THOUGHT THAT I MUST HAVE GOT A TOUCH OF THE SUN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
YOU CAN GO ROUND AND ROUND IT YOU CAN POLISH IT HIGHLY
WHICH CAME THITHER FOR WATER THESE THEY SHOT OR TRAPPED IN PITFALLS USING THE FLESH FOR FOOD AND AFTER THEIR CLOTHES WORE OUT THE HIDES FOR CLOTHING
I MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIM TOO I HAVE MONEY ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US AND MUCH MORE THAN ENOUGH KING SOLOMON'S MINES PROVIDED ME WITH THAT BUT I SAID NO LET THE BOY EARN HIS LIVING LET HIM LABOUR
SERVICEABLE SAVAGE PORTIONS THAT WE FALL BACK ON EMERGENCIES NOT ON THE POLISHED BUT UNSUBSTANTIAL TWENTIETH CIVILIZATION SHOULD WIPE AWAY OUR TEARS
ALL OF WHICH I HAD SHOT MYSELF THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS AS I NEVER KEEP ANY HORNS WHICH ARE NOT IN EVERY WAY PERFECT UNLESS IT MAY BE NOW AND AGAIN ON ACCOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATIONS CONNECTED WITH THEM
WHO GAVE US BIRTH AND WILL IN A DAY TO COME GIVE US OUR BURIAL ALSO AND SO IN MY TROUBLE AS I WALKED UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE OF MY HOUSE THERE IN YORKSHIRE
UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE FOR THERE IS A VESTIBULE IN MY HOUSE IN ENGLAND ON ALL THE FOUR WALLS OF THIS VESTIBULE WERE PLACED PAIRS OF HORNS ABOUT A HUNDRED PAIRS ALTOGETHER
FOR FEAR LEST WE SHOULD FLOOD THE MARKET THEY OFFER HOWEVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FOR A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THEM YOU MUST COME HOME QUATERMAIN AND SEE ABOUT THESE THINGS
INTO THE SOIL LIKE A TREE IT WILL ONCE MORE SOONER OR LATER FALL AGAIN AS THE EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION FELL AS THE HELLENIC CIVILIZATION FELL AND AS THE ROMAN CIVILIZATION AND MANY OTHERS
AND LIKE A NORTHERN LIGHT COMES BUT TO FADE AND LEAVE THE SKY MORE DARK OUT OF THE SOIL OF BARBARISM IT HAS GROWN LIKE A TREE AND AS I BELIEVE
HE DREAMS OF THE SIGHT OF ZULU IMPIS BREAKING ON THEIR FOES LIKE SURF UPON THE ROCKS AND HIS HEART RISES UP IN REBELLION AGAINST THE STRICT LIMITS OF THE CIVILIZED LIFE AH THIS CIVILIZATION
AND FACING TO THE STREAM WAS A COSY HUT BUILT MORE OR LESS ON THE KAFIR PRINCIPLE WITH GRASS AND WITHES BUT HAVING A FULL LENGTH DOOR INSTEAD OF A BEE HOLE
BUT FINALLY THEY REACHED THIS OASIS WHERE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT BEFELL GEORGE CURTIS ON THE DAY OF THEIR ARRIVAL HE WAS SITTING BY THE STREAM AND JIM WAS EXTRACTING THE HONEY FROM THE NEST OF A STINGLESS BEE
LYING IN THE CHURCHYARD WITHOUT FEELING AS THOUGH MY HEART WOULD BREAK IN TWO AND NOW THERE IS AN END OF THIS EGOTISTICAL TALK AND THERE SHALL BE NO MORE OF IT
A BOULDER FELL ON MY LEG AND CRUSHED IT AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO NEITHER FORWARD NOR BACK THEN I CAME UP HOW DO YOU DO MISTER NEVILLE I SAID DO YOU REMEMBER ME
AND RECOMMENDED US TO SELL BY DEGREES
FINALLY WE PREVAILED UPON HIM TO CONSENT TO THIS ARRANGEMENT BUT GEORGE CURTIS DID NOT KNOW OF IT UNTIL SOME TIME AFTERWARDS
YOU WILL REACH HERE BY CHRISTMAS AND I BOOK YOU TO STAY WITH ME FOR THAT GOOD IS COMING AND GEORGE AND SO BY THE WAY IS YOUR BOY HARRY THERE'S A BRIBE FOR YOU
IS SPREAD ALL OVER THE OTHER NINETEEN MAKING THEM APPEAR QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY REALLY ARE AS THE BLACKING DOES A BOOT OR THE VENEER A TABLE IT IS ON THE NINETEEN ROUGH
HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE HE HAD BEEN HOME HE HADN'T SEEN A WOMAN TO TOUCH HER EITHER AS REGARDS HER FIGURE OR THE SWEETNESS OF HER EXPRESSION I WANT YOU TO COME HOME MY DEAR OLD COMRADE
WHICH IS TO BE FOUND IN THE DESERT ON THE TOP OF A BANK IMMEDIATELY ABOVE HIM IN SO DOING HE LOOSENED A GREAT BOULDER OF ROCK WHICH FELL UPON GEORGE CURTIS'S RIGHT LEG CRUSHING IT FRIGHTFULLY
THERE I MIGHT GO ON FOR EVER BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD CIVILIZATION IS ONLY SAVAGERY SILVER GILT A VAINGLORY IS IT
BUT I COULD NOT EAT MUCH AND SOON I TOOK TO WALKING OR RATHER LIMPING BEING PERMANENTLY LAME FROM THE BITE OF A LION UP AND DOWN
AND MANY OTHER BOYS WHOM I SHALL NEVER KNOW MAY IN THE ACTS AND THOUGHTS OF ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS
I WOULD GO AWAY FROM THIS PLACE WHERE I LIVED IDLY AND AT EASE BACK AGAIN TO THE WILD LAND WHERE I HAD SPENT MY LIFE WHERE I MET MY DEAR WIFE AND POOR HARRY WAS BORN
AMONG THE WILD GAME AND THE SAVAGES YES AS I WALKED I BEGAN TO LONG TO SEE THE MOONLIGHT GLEAMING SILVERY WHITE OVER THE WIDE VELDT AND MYSTERIOUS SEA OF BUSH
AND SO DID SIR HENRY CURTIS STRONG MAN THOUGH HE IS AND AS FOR CAPTAIN GOOD I SAW HIM TURN AWAY TOO EVEN IN MY OWN DISTRESS I COULD NOT HELP NOTICING IT
AND WATCH THE LINES OF GAME TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIDGES TO THE WATER THE RULING PASSION IS STRONG IN DEATH THEY SAY AND MY HEART WAS DEAD THAT NIGHT BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF MY TROUBLE
AND WAITED IN SILENCE WATCHING THE BIG FLAKES FALL GENTLY ONE BY ONE LIKE HEAVENLY BENEDICTIONS AND MELT IN TEARS ON HARRY'S PALL
WHICH REPRESENT OUR PASSIONS HOPES FEARS JOYS ASPIRATIONS TOWARDS GOOD AND EVIL AND WHAT NOT ARE TURNED IN HIS MIGHTY HAND
AND BUILDED BARNS GOODS FOR MY BOY AND BARNS FOR HIM TO STORE THEM IN AND NOW HIS SOUL HAS BEEN REQUIRED OF HIM AND I AM LEFT DESOLATE
AND WANTED TO GAIN THE EXPERIENCE AND NOW THE DISEASE HAS KILLED HIM AND I OLD AND GREY AND WITHERED AM LEFT TO MOURN OVER HIM WITHOUT A CHICK OR CHILD TO COMFORT ME
HE HAD PASSED HIS LAST EXAMINATION WITH HONOURS AND I WAS PROUD OF THEM MUCH PROUDER THAN HE WAS I THINK AND THEN HE MUST NEEDS GO TO THAT SMALLPOX HOSPITAL HE WROTE TO ME THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF SMALLPOX
SAW US ALL ONCE MORE SAFE AND SOUND AT MY LITTLE PLACE ON THE BEREA NEAR DURBAN WHERE I AM NOW WRITING
AND HAVING SPOKEN TO GOOD I TOLD SIR HENRY THAT IT WAS OUR JOINT WISH THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A THIRD PORTION OF THE DIAMONDS OR IF HE WOULD NOT THAT HIS SHARE SHOULD BE HANDED TO HIS BROTHER WHO HAD SUFFERED EVEN MORE THAN OURSELVES ON THE CHANCE OF GETTING THEM
AND SO IT IS CALLED TO THIS DAY AND ALWAYS WILL BE CALLED AND MANY AN ELEPHANT HAVE I SHOT WITH THAT OLD GUN
IF IT IS ONLY TO SEE YOU HARRY MY BOY AND TO LOOK AFTER THE PRINTING OF THIS HISTORY WHICH IS A TASK THAT I DO NOT LIKE TO TRUST TO ANYBODY ELSE
AND IN ITS SEASON REDUCES US TO POWDER POOR HARRY TO GO SO SOON JUST WHEN HIS LIFE WAS OPENING TO HIM HE WAS DOING SO WELL AT THE HOSPITAL
ALL THESE THINGS SUGGEST TOUCHES OF KINSHIP AND YOU REMEMBER THAT IN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF YOUR NATURE YOU ARE QUITE IDENTICAL AS FOR YOU SIR WHO ALSO LAUGH
SIX MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF OUR RE ARRIVAL AT SITANDA'S WHERE WE FOUND OUR GUNS AND OTHER GOODS QUITE SAFE THOUGH THE OLD RASCAL IN CHARGE WAS MUCH DISGUSTED AT OUR SURVIVING TO CLAIM THEM
AND REALLY I AM AFRAID TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY PUT THEM AT IT SEEMS SO ENORMOUS
AND SINCE THIS JUDGMENT AND FEELING ARE A FACT WHICH HE WOULD PREFER TO AVOID IT IS DOING HIM A SERVICE TO WARN HIM OF IT BEFOREHAND AS OF ANY OTHER DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HE EXPOSES HIMSELF
AND I DO NOT SEE HOW THOSE WHO BELIEVE THIS CAN THINK OTHERWISE THAN THAT THE EXAMPLE ON THE WHOLE MUST BE MORE SALUTARY THAN HURTFUL SINCE IF IT DISPLAYS THE MISCONDUCT
BY SUSPENDING THE GREATER OPERATIONS OF INDUSTRY ON A PARTICULAR DAY BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION GROUNDED ON THE DIRECT INTEREST WHICH OTHERS HAVE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL'S OBSERVANCE OF THE PRACTICE
EFFECTUAL SUMPTUARY LAW AND THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNION IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR A PERSON POSSESSING A VERY LARGE INCOME TO FIND ANY MODE OF SPENDING IT WHICH WILL NOT INCUR POPULAR DISAPPROBATION
WE HAVE A RIGHT AND IT MAY BE OUR DUTY TO CAUTION OTHERS AGAINST HIM IF WE THINK HIS EXAMPLE OR CONVERSATION LIKELY TO HAVE A PERNICIOUS EFFECT ON THOSE WITH WHOM HE ASSOCIATES
AND USUALLY DIMINISHES BY A GREATER OR LESS AMOUNT THE GENERAL RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY IF HE DETERIORATES HIS BODILY OR MENTAL FACULTIES HE NOT ONLY BRINGS EVIL UPON ALL WHO DEPENDED ON HIM FOR ANY PORTION OF THEIR HAPPINESS
IT HAS HAD THE WHOLE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD
WE MUST BEWARE OF ADMITTING A PRINCIPLE OF WHICH WE SHOULD RESENT AS A GROSS INJUSTICE THE APPLICATION TO OURSELVES THE PRECEDING INSTANCES MAY BE OBJECTED TO ALTHOUGH UNREASONABLY
INFLICTION ON THEM OF ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE NOT JUSTIFIED BY HIS OWN RIGHTS FALSEHOOD OR DUPLICITY IN DEALING WITH THEM UNFAIR OR UNGENEROUS USE OF ADVANTAGES OVER THEM
BUT WHERE HAS THERE BEEN SEEN A PUBLIC WHICH SET ANY SUCH LIMIT TO ITS CENSORSHIP OR WHEN DOES THE PUBLIC TROUBLE ITSELF ABOUT UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE IN ITS INTERFERENCES WITH PERSONAL CONDUCT IT IS SELDOM THINKING OF ANYTHING
BINDING ON OURSELVES AND ON ALL OTHERS WHAT CAN THE POOR PUBLIC DO BUT APPLY THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND MAKE THEIR OWN PERSONAL FEELINGS OF GOOD AND EVIL IF THEY ARE TOLERABLY
EXCEPT PERHAPS TO THAT OF HOLDING OPINIONS IN SECRET WITHOUT EVER DISCLOSING THEM FOR
I CLAIM AS A CITIZEN A RIGHT TO LEGISLATE WHENEVER MY SOCIAL RIGHTS ARE INVADED BY THE SOCIAL ACT OF ANOTHER
NOT SIMPLY THREATENED BUT LONG SINCE CARRIED INTO TRIUMPHANT EFFECT
THOUGH NOT REQUIRED BY THEIR RELIGION
WHY IT MAY BE ASKED SHOULD NOT LAW SO FAR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH PRACTICABILITY AND SOCIAL CONVENIENCE ENDEAVOUR TO REPRESS THESE ALSO AND AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE UNAVOIDABLE IMPERFECTIONS OF LAW
TO PUT AN END TO WHAT SEEMS TO HIM A RETROGRADE STEP IN CIVILISATION IT ALSO APPEARS SO TO ME BUT I AM NOT AWARE THAT ANY COMMUNITY HAS A RIGHT TO FORCE ANOTHER TO BE CIVILISED
A THEORY OF SOCIAL RIGHTS THE LIKE OF WHICH PROBABLY NEVER BEFORE FOUND ITS WAY INTO DISTINCT LANGUAGE BEING NOTHING SHORT OF THIS THAT IT IS THE ABSOLUTE SOCIAL RIGHT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL
BY DERIVING A PROFIT FROM THE CREATION OF A MISERY I AM TAXED TO SUPPORT IT IMPEDES MY RIGHT TO FREE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT BY SURROUNDING MY PATH WITH DANGERS AND BY WEAKENING AND DEMORALISING SOCIETY
THEY SHOULD BE FOR EVER STIMULATING EACH OTHER TO INCREASED EXERCISE OF THEIR HIGHER FACULTIES AND INCREASED DIRECTION OF THEIR FEELINGS AND AIMS TOWARDS WISE INSTEAD OF FOOLISH ELEVATING INSTEAD OF DEGRADING OBJECTS AND CONTEMPLATIONS
IT MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE ESTABLISHMENT BY CUSTOM OF A HOLIDAY ON SOME OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK FOR THOSE PARTICULAR CLASSES OF PERSONS THE ONLY GROUND THEREFORE ON WHICH RESTRICTIONS ON SUNDAY AMUSEMENTS CAN BE DEFENDED MUST BE THAT THEY ARE RELIGIOUSLY WRONG
THE NEXT EXAMPLE HOWEVER SHALL BE TAKEN FROM AN INTERFERENCE WITH LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE BY NO MEANS PASSED ALL DANGER OF WHEREVER THE PURITANS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL AS IN NEW ENGLAND AND IN GREAT BRITAIN AT THE TIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH
AND IT EASILY COMES TO BE CONSIDERED A MARK OF SPIRIT AND COURAGE TO FLY IN THE FACE OF SUCH USURPED AUTHORITY AND DO WITH OSTENTATION THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT ENJOINS AS IN THE FASHION OF GROSSNESS WHICH SUCCEEDED IN THE TIME OF CHARLES TWO
AND EVEN IF RIGHT ARE AS LIKELY AS NOT TO BE MISAPPLIED TO INDIVIDUAL CASES
WHETHER HE DISPLEASES US IN THINGS IN WHICH WE THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL HIM OR IN THINGS IN WHICH WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE NOT IF HE DISPLEASES US WE MAY EXPRESS OUR DISTASTE AND WE MAY STAND ALOOF FROM A PERSON AS WELL AS FROM A THING THAT DISPLEASES US
AND OPINIONS PROPOSED WHICH ASSERT AN UNLIMITED RIGHT IN THE PUBLIC NOT ONLY TO PROHIBIT BY LAW EVERYTHING WHICH IT THINKS WRONG BUT IN ORDER TO GET AT WHAT IT THINKS WRONG TO PROHIBIT ANY NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH IT ADMITS TO BE INNOCENT
THAT THEY WERE FORCIBLY EXPELLED IN A BODY FROM THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FIRST GREW UP WHILE NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CHASED INTO A SOLITARY RECESS IN THE MIDST OF A DESERT MANY IN THIS COUNTRY OPENLY DECLARE THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT ONLY THAT IT IS NOT CONVENIENT
IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL OF ALL HUMAN PROPENSITIES AS A FIRST INSTANCE CONSIDER THE ANTIPATHIES WHICH MEN CHERISH ON NO BETTER GROUNDS THAN THAT PERSONS WHOSE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEIRS DO NOT PRACTISE THEIR RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
THAT THIS RELIGION LIKE OTHER AND BETTER RELIGIONS HAS ITS MARTYRS THAT ITS PROPHET AND FOUNDER WAS FOR HIS TEACHING PUT TO DEATH BY A MOB THAT OTHERS OF ITS ADHERENTS LOST THEIR LIVES BY THE SAME LAWLESS VIOLENCE
GROSS DISGUSTING WHAT DO PROTESTANTS THINK OF THESE PERFECTLY SINCERE FEELINGS AND OF THE ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THEM AGAINST NON CATHOLICS
THEIR AVERSION TO THE FLESH OF THE UNCLEAN BEAST IS ON THE CONTRARY OF THAT PECULIAR CHARACTER RESEMBLING AN INSTINCTIVE ANTIPATHY WHICH THE IDEA OF UNCLEANNESS
BUT THE ENORMITY OF ACTING OR FEELING DIFFERENTLY FROM ITSELF AND THIS STANDARD OF JUDGMENT THINLY DISGUISED IS HELD UP TO MANKIND AS THE DICTATE OF RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY BY NINE TENTHS OF ALL MORALISTS AND SPECULATIVE WRITERS
DISSIMULATION AND INSINCERITY IRASCIBILITY ON INSUFFICIENT CAUSE AND RESENTMENT DISPROPORTIONED TO THE PROVOCATION THE LOVE OF DOMINEERING OVER OTHERS THE DESIRE TO ENGROSS MORE THAN ONE'S SHARE OF ADVANTAGES
HARDLY ANY OFFENCE THAT IS COMMITTED WOULD DETRACT MORE FROM THE GENERAL SUM OF GOOD FINALLY IF BY HIS VICES OR FOLLIES A PERSON DOES NO DIRECT HARM TO OTHERS HE IS NEVERTHELESS IT MAY BE SAID INJURIOUS BY HIS EXAMPLE
BUT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ENTERTAINING ANY SUCH QUESTION WHEN A PERSON'S CONDUCT AFFECTS THE INTERESTS OF NO PERSONS BESIDES HIMSELF OR NEEDS NOT AFFECT THEM UNLESS THEY LIKE
COMBINED WITH THE NOTION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO A VETO ON THE MANNER IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS SHALL SPEND THEIR INCOMES WE HAVE ONLY FURTHER TO SUPPOSE A CONSIDERABLE DIFFUSION OF SOCIALIST OPINIONS
THE PEOPLE OF ONE ENGLISH COLONY AND OF NEARLY HALF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN INTERDICTED BY LAW FROM MAKING ANY USE WHATEVER OF FERMENTED DRINKS
IT IS EASY FOR ANY ONE TO IMAGINE AN IDEAL PUBLIC WHICH LEAVES THE FREEDOM AND CHOICE OF INDIVIDUALS IN ALL UNCERTAIN MATTERS UNDISTURBED AND ONLY REQUIRES THEM TO ABSTAIN FROM MODES OF CONDUCT WHICH UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE HAS CONDEMNED
IF WE DO NOT INTERFERE BENEVOLENTLY BY SHOWING INTEREST OR CONCERN FOR HIM IT IS FAR OTHERWISE IF HE HAS INFRINGED THE RULES NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY
TO INDIVIDUALITY SHOULD BELONG THE PART OF LIFE IN WHICH IT IS CHIEFLY THE INDIVIDUAL THAT IS INTERESTED TO SOCIETY THE PART WHICH CHIEFLY INTERESTS SOCIETY THOUGH SOCIETY IS NOT FOUNDED ON A CONTRACT
DIIS CURAE IT REMAINS TO BE PROVED THAT SOCIETY OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS HOLDS A COMMISSION FROM ON HIGH TO AVENGE ANY SUPPOSED OFFENCE TO OMNIPOTENCE WHICH IS NOT ALSO A WRONG TO OUR FELLOW CREATURES
WE HAVE A RIGHT ALSO IN VARIOUS WAYS TO ACT UPON OUR UNFAVOURABLE OPINION OF ANY ONE NOT TO THE OPPRESSION OF HIS INDIVIDUALITY BUT IN THE EXERCISE OF OURS
IF ANYTHING INVADES MY SOCIAL RIGHTS CERTAINLY THE TRAFFIC IN STRONG DRINK DOES IT DESTROYS MY PRIMARY RIGHT OF SECURITY BY CONSTANTLY CREATING AND STIMULATING SOCIAL DISORDER IT INVADES MY RIGHT OF EQUALITY
THE NOTION THAT IT IS ONE MAN'S DUTY THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE RELIGIOUS
AND PROFESS TO BE A KIND OF CHRISTIANS NO ONE HAS A DEEPER DISAPPROBATION THAN I HAVE OF THIS MORMON INSTITUTION
AND THE REPROBATION WHICH IS DUE TO HIM FOR AN OFFENCE AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS IS NOT A MERELY NOMINAL DISTINCTION IT MAKES A VAST DIFFERENCE BOTH IN OUR FEELINGS AND IN OUR CONDUCT TOWARDS HIM
WHEN THE PERIOD OF EDUCATION IS PAST THE SELF REGARDING VIRTUES SHOULD BE INCULCATED HUMAN BEINGS OWE TO EACH OTHER HELP TO DISTINGUISH THE BETTER FROM THE WORSE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO CHOOSE THE FORMER AND AVOID THE LATTER
HOW MUCH OF HUMAN LIFE SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALITY AND HOW MUCH TO SOCIETY EACH WILL RECEIVE ITS PROPER SHARE IF EACH HAS THAT WHICH MORE PARTICULARLY CONCERNS IT
THE SMALL NUMBER WHO FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS MUST STILL WORK OBTAIN A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE OF EARNINGS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGED TO FOLLOW THOSE OCCUPATIONS IF THEY PREFER LEISURE TO EMOLUMENT IF A FURTHER REMEDY IS SOUGHT
TO BE FIXED ON SOME EQUITABLE PRINCIPLE OF THE LABOURS AND SACRIFICES INCURRED FOR DEFENDING THE SOCIETY OR ITS MEMBERS FROM INJURY AND MOLESTATION THESE CONDITIONS SOCIETY IS JUSTIFIED IN ENFORCING AT ALL COSTS TO THOSE WHO ENDEAVOUR TO WITHHOLD FULFILMENT
THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTS DO NOT THEN FALL ON HIMSELF BUT ON OTHERS AND SOCIETY AS THE PROTECTOR OF ALL ITS MEMBERS MUST RETALIATE ON HIM MUST INFLICT PAIN ON HIM FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF PUNISHMENT
IN SOME OF HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES UNHAPPILY ARE AMONG THOSE WHO FIGURE IN POLITICAL LIFE THE ORGAN OF THE ALLIANCE WHO WOULD DEEPLY DEPLORE THE RECOGNITION OF ANY PRINCIPLE WHICH COULD BE WRESTED TO JUSTIFY BIGOTRY AND PERSECUTION
THE MORAL CULPABILITY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME GEORGE BARNWELL MURDERED HIS UNCLE TO GET MONEY FOR HIS MISTRESS BUT IF HE HAD DONE IT TO SET HIMSELF UP IN BUSINESS HE WOULD EQUALLY HAVE BEEN HANGED
AS DRAWN FROM CONTINGENCIES IMPOSSIBLE AMONG US OPINION IN THIS COUNTRY NOT BEING LIKELY TO ENFORCE ABSTINENCE FROM MEATS OR TO INTERFERE WITH PEOPLE FOR WORSHIPPING AND FOR EITHER MARRYING OR NOT MARRYING ACCORDING TO THEIR CREED OR INCLINATION
UNDERTAKES TO POINT OUT THE BROAD AND IMPASSABLE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDES SUCH PRINCIPLES FROM THOSE OF THE ASSOCIATION ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THOUGHT OPINION CONSCIENCE APPEAR TO ME HE SAYS TO BE WITHOUT THE SPHERE OF LEGISLATION
AND HAS BEEN MADE THE FOUNDATION OF A SOCIETY IN THE AGE OF NEWSPAPERS RAILWAYS AND THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH WHAT HERE CONCERNS US IS
OR WHO CAN BLAME PEOPLE FOR DESIRING TO SUPPRESS WHAT THEY REGARD AS A SCANDAL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND MAN NO STRONGER CASE CAN BE SHOWN FOR PROHIBITING ANYTHING WHICH IS REGARDED AS A PERSONAL IMMORALITY
THOUGH THE PHRASE IS NOT UNOBJECTIONABLE LOWNESS OR DEPRAVATION OF TASTE
THE OPERATIVES ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT IN THINKING THAT IF ALL WORKED ON SUNDAY SEVEN DAYS WORK WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR SIX DAYS WAGES BUT SO LONG AS THE GREAT MASS OF EMPLOYMENTS ARE SUSPENDED
BUT THE OPINION OF A SIMILAR MAJORITY IMPOSED AS A LAW ON THE MINORITY ON QUESTIONS OF SELF REGARDING CONDUCT IS QUITE AS LIKELY TO BE WRONG AS RIGHT FOR IN THESE CASES PUBLIC OPINION MEANS AT THE BEST
IF PROTECTION AGAINST THEMSELVES IS CONFESSEDLY DUE TO CHILDREN AND PERSONS UNDER AGE
OR JUSTIFIED BY ALLOWABLE SELF PREFERENCE IS A SUBJECT OF MORAL DISAPPROBATION FOR THAT FAILURE BUT NOT FOR THE CAUSE OF IT NOR FOR THE ERRORS MERELY PERSONAL TO HIMSELF WHICH MAY HAVE REMOTELY LED TO IT
HE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN'T HELP IT I WANT EVERYBODY TO LOVE ME AND IT HURTS ME SO WHEN ANYBODY DOESN'T AND ANTHONY NEVER WILL NOW OH I JUST MADE AN IDIOT OF MYSELF TODAY MARILLA I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
YOU LAUGH AT ME BECAUSE I THINK PAUL IS A GENIUS BUT I AM SURE HIS LETTER WILL CONVINCE YOU THAT HE IS A VERY UNCOMMON CHILD PAUL LIVES AWAY DOWN NEAR THE SHORE WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER AND HE HAS NO PLAYMATES NO REAL PLAYMATES

ANNE RECOVERING HERSELF SPRANG TO OPEN DOORS AND WINDOWS AND LET OUT THE GAS AND SMOKE WHICH FILLED THE ROOM THEN SHE HELPED THE GIRLS CARRY THE UNCONSCIOUS PRILLIE INTO THE PORCH
AND ASKED HER TO TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT THE LETTER ANNETTA CRIED AND FESSED UP FREELY SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER WRITTEN A LETTER AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO OR WHAT TO SAY
I WISH YOU COULD SEE SOME OF THEIR COMPOSITIONS SO MUCH DO I WISH IT THAT I'LL SEND YOU COPIES OF SOME WRITTEN RECENTLY LAST WEEK I TOLD THE FOURTH CLASS I WANTED THEM TO WRITE ME LETTERS ABOUT ANYTHING THEY PLEASED ADDING BY WAY OF SUGGESTION THAT THEY MIGHT TELL ME OF SOME PLACE THEY HAD VISITED
P E ISLAND CAN BIRDS DEAR TEACHER I THINK I WILL WRITE YOU A COMPOSITION ABOUT BIRDS BIRDS IS VERY USEFUL ANIMALS MY CAT CATCHES BIRDS HIS NAME IS WILLIAM BUT PA CALLS HIM TOM
A JONAH DAY IT REALLY BEGAN THE NIGHT BEFORE WITH A RESTLESS WAKEFUL VIGIL OF GRUMBLING TOOTHACHE WHEN ANNE AROSE IN THE DULL BITTER WINTER MORNING SHE FELT THAT LIFE WAS FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE
WHEN WE GOT UP I STEPPED ON HER DRESS AND ALL THE GATHERS TORE OUT OF THE SKIRT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I GOT UP I HIT THE PITCHER AGAINST THE BASIN AND CRACKED THEM BOTH AND I UPSET A CUP OF TEA ON THE TABLECLOTH AT BREAKFAST
FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO SIT IN THE HALL AFTER THIS WITHOUT BEING LEAKED ON YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH ANYHOW
ESPECIALLY AS SHE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE MOUSE HAD GONE BUT SHE DECIDED NOT TO WHO COULD TAKE ANY COMFORT OUT OF HYSTERICS WITH A TEACHER SO WHITE FACED AND SO BLAZING EYED STANDING BEFORE ONE WHO PUT THAT MOUSE IN MY DESK SAID ANNE
EXCUSE ME YOU MUSTN'T MIND IT IT'S JUST A HABIT I'VE GOT YOU'D THINK HE WAS CRAZY WOULDN'T YOU AND AS FOR MISSUS LYNDE BEING A BUSYBODY PERHAPS SHE IS BUT DID YOU TELL HER SHE HAD A VERY KIND HEART AND ALWAYS HELPED THE POOR
ANNE HAD WARNED THEM THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ANY MORE CAKES TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND YET HERE WAS SAINT CLAIR DONNELL COOLLY PASSING A PARCEL OF THEM WRAPPED UP IN THE BLUE AND WHITE STRIPED PAPER MISSUS HIRAM USED UNDER HER VERY EYES
ANNE TOOK HER POINTER FROM HER DESK IT WAS A LONG HEAVY HARDWOOD POINTER COME HERE ANTHONY IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT ANTHONY PYE HAD EVER UNDERGONE ANNE
HE LETS IT SLEEP ON HIS ROCKING CHARE AND MY AUNT SAYS HE THINKS MORE OF IT THAN HE DOES OF HIS CHILDREN THAT IS NOT RIGHT WE OUGHT TO BE KIND TO CATS AND GIVE THEM NEW MILK BUT WE OUGHT NOT BE BETTER TO THEM THAN TO OUR CHILDREN
THE LUCKLESS IMPROVERS EXPECTED THAT AVONLEA WOULD BE MORE PREJUDICED THAN EVER AGAINST THEM BUT INSTEAD PUBLIC SYMPATHY VEERED AROUND IN THEIR FAVOR
EVERYBODY REALIZED THAT EVEN THE EXPLOSION HAD NOT CLEARED THE TEACHER'S MENTAL ATMOSPHERE NOBODY EXCEPT ANTHONY PYE DARED WHISPER A WORD NED CLAY ACCIDENTALLY SQUEAKED HIS PENCIL WHILE WORKING A SUM CAUGHT ANNE'S EYE AND WISHED THE FLOOR WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW HIM UP
BUT THE KNOWLEDGE ONLY ANGERED HER FURTHER
CHESTER SLOANE SPELLING ODORIFEROUS WITH TWO F'S WAS MADE TO FEEL THAT HE COULD NEVER LIVE DOWN THE DISGRACE OF IT EITHER IN THIS WORLD OR THAT WHICH IS TO COME
AND NEVER SAID A WORD WHEN TIMOTHY COTTON STOLE A CROCK OF BUTTER OUT OF HER DAIRY AND TOLD HIS WIFE HE'D BOUGHT IT FROM HER MISSUS COTTON CAST IT UP TO HER THE NEXT TIME THEY MET THAT IT TASTED OF TURNIPS AND MISSUS LYNDE JUST SAID SHE WAS SORRY IT HAD TURNED OUT SO POORLY
IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO OH NO NO MARILLA AND I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN EVER LOOK THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FACE AGAIN I FEEL THAT I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO THE VERY DUST YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CROSS AND HATEFUL AND HORRID I WAS
YOU ONLY TELL THE DISAGREEABLE PART OF THE TRUTH NOW YOU'VE TOLD ME A DOZEN TIMES THAT MY HAIR WAS RED BUT YOU'VE NEVER ONCE TOLD ME THAT I HAD A NICE NOSE
BECAUSE HER COUSIN IN MONTREAL WENT ON A HONEYMOON WHEN HE WAS MARRIED AND HE HAD ALWAYS HAD THE VERY LATEST IN BICYCLES ANOTHER DAY I ASKED THEM ALL TO TELL ME THE NAUGHTIEST THING THEY HAD EVER DONE I COULDN'T GET THE OLDER ONES TO DO SO BUT THE THIRD CLASS ANSWERED QUITE FREELY

BUT IF YOU WERE A WIDOW THERE'D BE NO DANGER OF EITHER THE MOST REMARKABLE WISH WAS SALLY BELL'S SHE WANTED A HONEYMOON
AND THERE UPON ME NOT TEN FEET FROM MY BREAST WAS THE POINT OF THAT HUGE SPEAR A SPEAR FORTY FEET LONG TIPPED WITH GLEAMING METAL AND HELD LOW AT THE SIDE OF A MOUNTED REPLICA
EVIDENTLY HE FEARED THAT WERE I TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENED AGAIN I MIGHT JUMP ENTIRELY OUT OF THE LANDSCAPE HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH HIS MEN MOTIONED TO ME THAT I WOULD RIDE BEHIND ONE OF THEM AND THEN MOUNTED HIS OWN ANIMAL
OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
MY EFFORT WAS CROWNED WITH A SUCCESS WHICH APPALLED ME NO LESS THAN IT SEEMED TO SURPRISE THE MARTIAN WARRIORS FOR IT CARRIED ME FULLY THIRTY FEET INTO THE AIR AND LANDED ME A HUNDRED FEET
BUT I NOTICED THAT WHEN I SMILED SLIGHTLY ON CONCLUDING HE DID LIKEWISE THIS FACT AND THE SIMILAR OCCURRENCE DURING MY FIRST TALK WITH TARS TARKAS CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAD AT LEAST SOMETHING IN COMMON THE ABILITY TO SMILE
MY MUSCLES PERFECTLY ATTUNED AND ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ON EARTH PLAYED THE MISCHIEF WITH ME IN ATTEMPTING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COPE WITH THE LESSER GRAVITATION AND LOWER AIR PRESSURE ON MARS
WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR THE WEIGHT OF THESE RIFLES IS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE AND WITH THE SMALL CALIBER EXPLOSIVE RADIUM PROJECTILES WHICH THEY USE AND THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE BARREL
TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CITY WAS A LARGE PLAZA AND UPON THIS AND IN THE BUILDINGS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING IT WERE CAMPED SOME NINE OR TEN HUNDRED CREATURES OF THE SAME BREED AS MY CAPTORS
ON SUCH A LITTLE THING MY LIFE HUNG THAT I OFTEN MARVEL THAT I ESCAPED SO EASILY HAD NOT THE RIFLE OF THE LEADER OF THE PARTY SWUNG FROM ITS FASTENINGS BESIDE HIS SADDLE IN SUCH A WAY
AND SOME TELEPATHIC FORCE MUST HAVE WARNED ME AGAINST AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT FROM UNDER THE MUZZLES OF TWENTY OF THESE DEATH DEALING MACHINES
WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCORD I THEREFORE IGNORED THE REPEATED COMMANDS TO SAK AND EACH TIME THEY WERE MADE I MOTIONED TO MY MOUTH AND RUBBED MY STOMACH
I SAW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND GATHERING MYSELF TOGETHER I SAKKED WITH SUCH MARVELOUS SUCCESS THAT I CLEARED A GOOD HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET NOR DID I THIS TIME LOSE MY EQUILIBRIUM BUT LANDED SQUARELY UPON MY FEET
BUT I WAS NOT LONG IN BEING ENLIGHTENED THEY FIRST REPEATED THE WORD SAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN TARS TARKAS MADE SEVERAL JUMPS REPEATING THE SAME WORD BEFORE EACH LEAP THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID SAK
I WAS NOT ASLEEP NO NEED FOR PINCHING HERE MY INNER CONSCIOUSNESS TOLD ME AS PLAINLY THAT I WAS UPON MARS AS YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE UPON EARTH YOU DO NOT QUESTION THE FACT
AS NO TWO OF US ARE IDENTICAL ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALL CAST IN A SIMILAR MOLD THIS PICTURE OR RATHER MATERIALIZED NIGHTMARE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AT LENGTH
WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TURNING THE HEAD THE EARS WHICH WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE EYES AND CLOSER TOGETHER WERE SMALL CUP SHAPED ANTENNAE PROTRUDING NOT MORE THAN AN INCH ON THESE YOUNG SPECIMENS
FOR SUCH I NOW CONSIDERED THEM DESPITE THE SUAVE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD BEEN TRAPPED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THEIR ORNAMENTS ALL WERE NAKED THE WOMEN VARIED IN APPEARANCE BUT LITTLE FROM THE MEN EXCEPT THAT THEIR TUSKS WERE MUCH LARGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR HEIGHT
HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
I WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER TO EXPLORE THE LOW STRUCTURE WHICH WAS THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF HABITATION IN SIGHT
AND SO NOW I WENT SKIPPING AND FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE DESKS AND CHAIRS LIKE SOME MONSTROUS GRASSHOPPER AFTER BRUISING MYSELF SEVERELY
THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
AT THE SAME TIME HE MOTIONED HIS FOLLOWERS TO ADVANCE THEY STARTED TOWARD US ON A WILD RUN
IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
THEIR NOSES WERE BUT LONGITUDINAL SLITS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR FACES MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS THERE WAS NO HAIR ON THEIR BODIES
TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
WHEN HE WAS WITHIN ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF ME HE UNCLASPED AN ENORMOUS METAL ARMLET AND HOLDING IT TOWARD ME IN THE OPEN PALM OF HIS HAND ADDRESSED ME IN A CLEAR RESONANT VOICE
MY CAPTOR MERELY STRODE UP TO THE ROSTRUM THE OTHERS MAKING WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE CHIEFTAIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND UTTERED THE NAME OF MY ESCORT WHO IN TURN HALTED AND REPEATED THE NAME OF THE RULER FOLLOWED BY HIS TITLE
AS TO STRIKE AGAINST THE BUTT OF HIS GREAT METAL SHOD SPEAR I SHOULD HAVE SNUFFED OUT WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT DEATH WAS NEAR ME BUT THE LITTLE SOUND CAUSED ME TO TURN
WHICH WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE ON EARTH THE THEORETIC EFFECTIVE RADIUS OF THIS RIFLE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT THE BEST THEY CAN DO IN ACTUAL SERVICE
FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
TRAILED NINETEEN OTHERS SIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS BUT AS I LEARNED LATER BEARING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES PRECISELY
AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
CHAPTER FOUR A PRISONER WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TEN MILES WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE VERY RAPIDLY WE WERE AS I WAS LATER TO LEARN NEARING THE EDGE OF ONE OF MARS LONG DEAD SEAS IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFTAIN THEN EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED A DESIRE TO SEE ME PERFORM AND MOTIONING ME TO FOLLOW HE STARTED WITH TARS TARKAS FOR THE OPEN PLAZA NOW I HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO WALK SINCE MY FIRST SIGNAL FAILURE
NOR WAS THERE ROOM BENEATH THE DESKS FOR THEIR LONG LEGS EVIDENTLY THEN THERE WERE OTHER DENIZENS ON MARS THAN THE WILD AND GROTESQUE CREATURES INTO WHOSE HANDS I HAD FALLEN BUT THE EVIDENCES OF EXTREME ANTIQUITY
AND SO HUMAN LIFE HAS COME TO BE CONSIDERED BUT LIGHTLY ON MARS AS IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR DANGEROUS SPORTS AND THE ALMOST CONTINUAL WARFARE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES
IN AVIATION AND IN WAR BUT PERHAPS BY FAR THE GREATEST DEATH LOSS COMES DURING THE AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN VAST NUMBERS OF THE LITTLE MARTIANS FALL VICTIMS TO THE GREAT WHITE APES OF MARS
SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
MAKING THESE WEAPONS PRESENT A SINGULARLY FORMIDABLE APPEARANCE MOST OF THESE DETAILS I NOTED LATER FOR I WAS GIVEN BUT LITTLE TIME TO SPECULATE ON THE WONDERS OF MY NEW DISCOVERY
WHICH LEADS NO LIVING MARTIAN KNOWS WHITHER AND FROM WHOSE BOSOM NO MARTIAN HAS EVER RETURNED OR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE DID HE RETURN AFTER ONCE EMBARKING UPON ITS COLD DARK WATERS
WAS FULLY FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT
IS TO INFLICT DEATH ON THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR IN VARIOUS INGENIOUS AND HORRIBLE WAYS THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS AND CHIEFTAINS EXAMINED ME CLOSELY FEELING MY MUSCLES AND THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN
WITHOUT A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION AS WE NEARED THE PLAZA AND MY PRESENCE WAS DISCOVERED WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PLUCK ME FROM MY SEAT BEHIND MY GUARD A WORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY
IT HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN ME TO SEE THE ROOF OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS OF SOLID GLASS
HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
I CONCLUDED TO HAZARD A LITTLE CONVERSATION ON MY OWN PART AS I HAD GUESSED THAT HE WAS MAKING OVERTURES OF PEACE THE THROWING DOWN OF HIS WEAPONS AND THE WITHDRAWING OF HIS TROOP BEFORE HIS ADVANCE TOWARD ME
WHEN EQUIPPED WITH THEIR WIRELESS FINDERS AND SIGHTERS IS BUT A TRIFLE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES THIS IS QUITE FAR ENOUGH TO IMBUE ME WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MARTIAN FIREARM
IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
ABOUT FOUR FEET IN HEIGHT NO WATER AND NO OTHER VEGETATION THAN THE MOSS WAS IN EVIDENCE AND AS I WAS SOMEWHAT THIRSTY I DETERMINED TO DO A LITTLE EXPLORING SPRINGING TO MY FEET I RECEIVED MY FIRST MARTIAN SURPRISE
AS THE MUSCULAR EXERTION WHICH CARRIED ME EASILY AND SAFELY UPON EARTH PLAYED STRANGE ANTICS WITH ME UPON MARS INSTEAD OF PROGRESSING IN A SANE AND DIGNIFIED MANNER
AND WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED THE CHIEFTAIN ADDRESSED ME AT SOME LENGTH I REPLIED IN OUR GOOD OLD ENGLISH TONGUE MERELY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT NEITHER OF US COULD UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
AND THE GROTESQUE CARICATURES WHICH SAT BLINKING IN THE SUNLIGHT WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE ME TO DOUBT MY SANITY THEY SEEMED MOSTLY HEAD WITH LITTLE SCRAWNY BODIES LONG NECKS AND SIX LEGS OR
ABOUT I FOUND A LARGE CROCODILE WITH HIS MOUTH EXTENDED ALMOST READY TO RECEIVE ME ON MY RIGHT HAND WAS THE PIECE OF WATER BEFORE MENTIONED AND ON MY LEFT A DEEP PRECIPICE SAID TO HAVE
FIRST AND FOREMOST FAGUEY SAID TOBY YES YES INTERPOSED THE JEW DRAWING UP HIS CHAIR
THEY'RE SO HAPPY SO FROLICSOME AND SO CHEERFUL THAT THEY ARE QUITE COMPANIONS FOR ME VERY NICE ANIMALS MA'AM REPLIED MISTER BUMBLE APPROVINGLY SO VERY DOMESTIC OH YES REJOINED THE MATRON WITH ENTHUSIASM
THE FOLLOWING SINGULAR ADVENTURES MAY NOT PROVE UNENTERTAINING AFTER WE HAD RESIDED AT CEYLON ABOUT A FORTNIGHT I ACCOMPANIED ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BROTHERS UPON A SHOOTING PARTY
THE ASTONISHING EFFECTS OF A STORM ARRIVES AT CEYLON COMBATS AND CONQUERS TWO EXTRAORDINARY OPPONENTS RETURNS TO HOLLAND SOME YEARS BEFORE MY BEARD ANNOUNCED APPROACHING MANHOOD OR IN OTHER WORDS WHEN I WAS NEITHER MAN NOR BOY
WAS UNABLE TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF SUCH A VIOLENT ROAR THAT THE ABUSED MISTER CHITLING WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY CEREMONIES RUSHED ACROSS THE ROOM AND AIMED A BLOW AT THE OFFENDER WHO BEING SKILFUL IN EVADING PURSUIT DUCKED TO AVOID IT AND CHOSE HIS TIME SO WELL
AT WHICH SOME PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE THEIR FILL OF LAUGHTER IN THE OUTSET
I AM NOT GOING TO STAND THIS SORT OF THING ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE HE CONTINUED LEAPING FROM HIS STOOL AND GIVING BOB SUCH A DIG IN THE WAISTCOAT THAT HE STAGGERED BACK INTO THE TANK AGAIN AND THEREFORE I AM ABOUT TO RAISE YOUR SALARY
AND FOUND THAT EVERYTHING COULD YIELD HIM PLEASURE HE HAD NEVER DREAMED THAT ANY WALK THAT ANYTHING COULD GIVE HIM SO MUCH HAPPINESS IN THE AFTERNOON HE TURNED HIS STEPS TOWARDS HIS NEPHEW'S HOUSE HE PASSED THE DOOR A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE HE HAD THE COURAGE TO GO UP AND KNOCK
AND MEDITATED FOR SOME SECONDS HIS FACE WORKING WITH AGITATION THE WHILE AS IF HE DREADED SOMETHING AND FEARED TO KNOW THE WORST AT LENGTH HE RAISED HIS HEAD WHERE IS HE HE ASKED
THOUGH THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS TYRANT WAS ACCIDENTAL THE PEOPLE CHOSE THE CUCUMBER GATHERERS FOR THEIR GOVERNORS AS A MARK OF THEIR GRATITUDE FOR DESTROYING THOUGH ACCIDENTALLY
AND ALL OF US AND SO AS TINY TIM OBSERVED GOD BLESS US
SAID MISSUS CORNEY PETTISHLY I SHALL NEVER GET ANOTHER LIKE HIM
THE BEADLE DRANK HIS TEA TO THE LAST DROP FINISHED A PIECE OF TOAST WHISKED THE CRUMBS OFF HIS KNEES WIPED HIS LIPS AND DELIBERATELY KISSED THE MATRON MISTER BUMBLE CRIED THAT DISCREET LADY IN A WHISPER FOR THE FRIGHT WAS SO GREAT THAT SHE HAD QUITE LOST HER VOICE
JOHN THE PORTER TRAVELS OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN CHAPTER ONE
TOBY CONTINUED TO EAT WITH THE UTMOST OUTWARD INDIFFERENCE UNTIL HE COULD EAT NO MORE THEN
AT FIRST THE JEW CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH PATIENTLY WATCHING HIS COUNTENANCE AS IF TO GAIN FROM ITS EXPRESSION SOME CLUE TO THE INTELLIGENCE HE BROUGHT BUT IN VAIN
BRING HIM DOWN HUSH QUIET CHARLEY GENTLY TOM SCARCE SCARCE THIS BRIEF DIRECTION TO CHARLEY BATES AND HIS RECENT ANTAGONIST WAS SOFTLY AND IMMEDIATELY OBEYED THERE WAS NO SOUND OF THEIR WHEREABOUT WHEN THE DODGER DESCENDED THE STAIRS BEARING THE LIGHT IN HIS HAND
THANK'EE SAID SCROOGE I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU I THANK YOU FIFTY TIMES BLESS YOU HE WENT TO CHURCH AND WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE HURRYING TO AND FRO AND PATTED CHILDREN ON THE HEAD AND QUESTIONED BEGGARS
OLD SALLY IS A GOING FAST WELL WHAT'S THAT TO ME ANGRILY DEMANDED THE MATRON I CAN'T KEEP HER ALIVE CAN I NO NO MISTRESS REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN NOBODY CAN SHE'S FAR BEYOND THE REACH OF HELP
AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS THE NIGHT WAS BITTER COLD THE SNOW LAY ON THE GROUND FROZEN INTO A HARD THICK CRUST SO THAT ONLY THE HEAPS THAT HAD DRIFTED INTO BYWAYS AND CORNERS WERE AFFECTED BY THE SHARP WIND THAT HOWLED ABROAD
THAT'S TWO DOUBLES AND THE RUB SAID MISTER CHITLING WITH A VERY LONG FACE AS HE DREW HALF A CROWN FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET I NEVER SEE SUCH A FELLER AS YOU JACK YOU WIN EVERYTHING
AND HE DID IT YES HE DID THE CLOCK STRUCK NINE NO BOB A QUARTER PAST NO BOB HE WAS FULL EIGHTEEN MINUTES AND A HALF BEHIND HIS TIME SCROOGE SAT WITH HIS DOOR WIDE OPEN THAT HE MIGHT SEE HIM COME INTO THE TANK
BUT IT TURNED OUT A GOOD JOB FOR YOU DIDN'T IT FAGIN AND WHAT'S SIX WEEKS OF IT
THE VERY GOODS WHICH HE HAD THUS TAKEN FROM THEM WERE SPOILING IN HIS STORES
THE MATRON OF THE WORKHOUSE TO WHICH OUR READERS HAVE BEEN ALREADY INTRODUCED AS THE BIRTHPLACE OF OLIVER TWIST SAT HERSELF DOWN BEFORE A CHEERFUL FIRE IN HER OWN LITTLE ROOM AND GLANCED WITH NO SMALL DEGREE OF COMPLACENCY AT A SMALL ROUND TABLE ON WHICH STOOD A TRAY OF CORRESPONDING SIZE
POINTING DISCONSOLATELY TO HIS TOP BOOTS
EXCITED CONSIDERABLE ADMIRATION IN THE MIND OF MISTER CHITLING IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT THE LATTER GENTLEMAN AND HIS PARTNER INVARIABLY LOST AND THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE SO FAR FROM ANGERING MASTER BATES
I HEARD A VIOLENT BUT UNUSUAL NOISE DIFFERENT FROM ANY SOUND THAT HAD EVER BEFORE ASSAILED MY EARS
AT THE CITY OF LONDON ENGLAND WE THE UNDERSIGNED AS TRUE BELIEVERS IN THE PROFIT DO MOST SOLEMNLY AFFIRM THAT ALL THE ADVENTURES OF OUR FRIEND BARON MUNCHAUSEN IN WHATEVER COUNTRY THEY MAY LIE ARE POSITIVE AND SIMPLE FACTS AND
AND DESTROYED HIM BY SUFFOCATION FOR HE COULD NEITHER GORGE NOR EJECT IT
HARK CRIED THE DODGER AT THIS MOMENT I HEARD THE TINKLER
MANY HUNGER WORN OUTCASTS CLOSE THEIR EYES IN OUR BARE STREETS AT SUCH TIMES WHO LET THEIR CRIMES HAVE BEEN WHAT THEY MAY CAN HARDLY OPEN THEM IN A MORE BITTER WORLD SUCH WAS THE ASPECT OF OUT OF DOORS AFFAIRS WHEN MISSUS CORNEY
AND TO SHAKE THE SNOW OFF HIS COAT AND WHO NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEARING THE COCKED HAT IN ONE HAND AND A BUNDLE IN THE OTHER SHALL I SHUT THE DOOR MA'AM THE LADY MODESTLY HESITATED TO REPLY
YOU'LL BE A FINE YOUNG CRACKSMAN AFORE THE OLD FILE NOW WITH THESE WORDS HE PULLED UP THE SMOCK FROCK AND WINDING IT ROUND HIS MIDDLE DREW A CHAIR TO THE FIRE AND PLACED HIS FEET UPON THE HOB
OUT OF DOOR RELIEF PROPERLY MANAGED PROPERLY MANAGED MA'AM IS THE POROCHIAL SAFEGUARD THE GREAT PRINCIPLE OF OUT OF DOOR RELIEF IS TO GIVE THE PAUPERS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DON'T WANT
AS I HAVE SINCE LEARNED A RECEPTACLE AT THE BOTTOM FOR VENOMOUS CREATURES IN SHORT I GAVE MYSELF UP AS LOST FOR THE LION WAS NOW UPON HIS HIND LEGS JUST IN THE ACT OF SEIZING ME I FELL INVOLUNTARILY TO THE GROUND WITH FEAR
MISTER BUMBLE I SHALL SCREAM MISTER BUMBLE MADE NO REPLY BUT IN A SLOW AND DIGNIFIED MANNER PUT HIS ARM ROUND THE MATRON'S WAIST
PLEASE IT'S ONLY ONCE A YEAR SIR PLEADED BOB APPEARING FROM THE TANK IT SHALL NOT BE REPEATED I WAS MAKING RATHER MERRY YESTERDAY SIR NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY FRIEND SAID SCROOGE
YOU MUST GET UP VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING TO WIN AGAINST THE DODGER MORNING SAID CHARLEY BATES
AND WHISPERED FAGIN MYSTERIOUSLY WHAT CRIED THE JEW ALONE THE DODGER NODDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND SHADING THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE WITH HIS HAND GAVE CHARLEY BATES A PRIVATE INTIMATION IN DUMB SHOW THAT HE HAD BETTER NOT BE FUNNY JUST THEN
AS SHE SAT DOWN HER EYES ONCE AGAIN ENCOUNTERED THOSE OF THE GALLANT BEADLE SHE COLOURED AND APPLIED HERSELF TO THE TASK OF MAKING HIS TEA AGAIN MISTER BUMBLE COUGHED LOUDER THIS TIME THAN HE HAD COUGHED YET
OF COURSE NOT WHEN WOULD THEY BE MISTER BUMBLE SAID THE MATRON SIPPING HER TEA WHEN INDEED MA'AM REJOINED MISTER BUMBLE
I WOULD DROWN IT MYSELF WITH PLEASURE
ALIVE OR DEAD THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT HIM THE JEW STOPPED TO HEAR NO MORE BUT UTTERING A LOUD YELL AND TWINING HIS HANDS IN HIS HAIR RUSHED FROM THE ROOM
I VENTURED TO RAISE MY HEAD AND LOOK ROUND WHEN
ANGRILY PURSUED THE POOR HALF WITTED DUPE
WE STOPPED TO TAKE HIM BETWEEN US HIS HEAD HUNG DOWN AND HE WAS COLD THEY WERE CLOSE UPON OUR HEELS EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF AND EACH FROM THE GALLOWS
MISTER BUMBLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE HESITATION AND BEING VERY COLD HIMSELF SHUT IT WITHOUT PERMISSION HARD WEATHER MISTER BUMBLE SAID THE MATRON HARD INDEED MA'AM REPLIED THE BEADLE
BUT BETWEEN BOTH I EXPRESSED IN REPEATED CONVERSATIONS A STRONG DESIRE OF SEEING THE WORLD FROM WHICH I WAS DISCOURAGED BY MY PARENTS THOUGH MY FATHER HAD BEEN NO INCONSIDERABLE TRAVELLER HIMSELF
YES SAID THE JEW
AND THAT WITHOUT ASKING MY CONSENT WHAT WAS TO BE DONE IN THIS HORRIBLE DILEMMA
AND MOREOVER INDULGED IN MANY JESTS AND IRRELEVANT REMARKS ALL HIGHLY UNBECOMING A SCIENTIFIC RUBBER INDEED THE ARTFUL PRESUMING UPON THEIR CLOSE ATTACHMENT
AND I HAD NO OTHER ABOUT ME HOWEVER THOUGH I COULD HAVE NO IDEA OF KILLING SUCH AN ANIMAL WITH THAT WEAK KIND OF AMMUNITION YET I HAD SOME HOPES OF FRIGHTENING HIM BY THE REPORT AND PERHAPS OF WOUNDING HIM ALSO I IMMEDIATELY LET FLY WITHOUT WAITING TILL HE WAS WITHIN REACH
IT WAS A ROUND TABLE AND AS MISSUS CORNEY AND MISTER BUMBLE HAD BEEN SITTING OPPOSITE EACH OTHER WITH NO GREAT SPACE BETWEEN THEM AND FRONTING THE FIRE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT MISTER BUMBLE
MY COMPANION ARRIVED IN SEARCH OF ME FOR FINDING I DID NOT FOLLOW HIM INTO THE WOOD HE RETURNED APPREHENDING I HAD LOST MY WAY OR MET WITH SOME ACCIDENT AFTER MUTUAL CONGRATULATIONS WE MEASURED THE CROCODILE WHICH WAS JUST
VARYING THESE AMUSEMENTS OCCASIONALLY BY FETCHING A DEEP SIGH
IF YOU PLEASE MISTRESS SAID A WITHERED OLD FEMALE PAUPER HIDEOUSLY UGLY
AS SHE HELD OUT HER HAND FOR THE BEADLE'S CUP AND A VERY HARD HEARTED MAN BESIDES
THAT THE BOARD ORDERED FOR THE INFIRMARY REAL FRESH GENUINE PORT WINE
IS HE GRATEFUL MA'AM IS HE GRATEFUL NOT A COPPER FARTHING'S WORTH OF IT
PACING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM MEANWHILE IN IRREPRESSIBLE EXCITEMENT
MINISTERS OF STATE LORD MAYORS AND OTHER GREAT PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES BUT MORE PARTICULARLY BENEATH THE STATELINESS AND GRAVITY OF A BEADLE WHO AS IS WELL KNOWN SHOULD BE THE STERNEST AND MOST INFLEXIBLE AMONG THEM ALL
AND TOOK IT UP AFTERWARDS SHE HAD JUST TASTED HER FIRST CUP WHEN SHE WAS DISTURBED BY A SOFT TAP AT THE ROOM DOOR
TO GIVE UTTERANCE TO CERTAIN SOFT NOTHINGS WHICH HOWEVER WELL THEY MAY BECOME THE LIPS OF THE LIGHT AND THOUGHTLESS DO SEEM IMMEASURABLY BENEATH THE DIGNITY OF JUDGES OF THE LAND MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT
SAID THE WORTHY MATRON SETTING IT DOWN VERY HASTILY ON THE HOB
EXCELLENT THEN PLACING HIS FEET AGAINST THE LOW MANTELPIECE SO AS TO BRING HIS BOOTS TO ABOUT THE LEVEL OF HIS EYE HE QUIETLY RESUMED FIRST AND FOREMOST FAGUEY SAID THE HOUSEBREAKER HOW'S BILL WHAT
AH TO BE SURE MY DEAR REPLIED THE JEW
WHAT A VERY CURIOUS QUESTION FROM A SINGLE MAN
AND CALLING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE COURT FOR HELP AND A STRAIT WAISTCOAT A MERRY CHRISTMAS BOB SAID SCROOGE WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS HE CLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK A MERRIER CHRISTMAS BOB MY GOOD FELLOW THAN I HAVE GIVEN YOU FOR MANY A YEAR
YOU HAVE A CAT MA'AM I SEE SAID MISTER BUMBLE GLANCING AT ONE WHO IN THE CENTRE OF HER FAMILY WAS BASKING BEFORE THE FIRE AND KITTENS TOO I DECLARE I AM SO FOND OF THEM MISTER BUMBLE YOU CAN'T THINK REPLIED THE MATRON
ACQUIRED GREAT ADDITIONAL INTEREST FROM HIS CLOSE OBSERVANCE OF THE GAME AND HIS ATTENTIVE PERUSAL OF MISTER CHITLING'S HAND UPON WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME AS OCCASION SERVED HE BESTOWED A VARIETY OF EARNEST GLANCES
AND I WENT PARTNERS WITH HIM AGAINST THE ARTFULL AND DUMB
WHICH HAD SERVED HIM IN LIEU OF COUNTERS WHISTLING MEANTIME WITH PECULIAR SHRILLNESS
IF YOU PLEASE SAID SCROOGE NOT A FARTHING LESS A GREAT MANY BACK PAYMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN IT I ASSURE YOU WILL YOU DO ME THAT FAVOUR MY DEAR SIR SAID THE OTHER SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO SUCH MUNIFI DON'T SAY ANYTHING PLEASE RETORTED SCROOGE
THE JEW PERCEIVING THAT MISTER CHITLING WAS CONSIDERABLY ROUSED HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM THAT NOBODY WAS LAUGHING AND TO PROVE THE GRAVITY OF THE COMPANY APPEALED TO MASTER BATES THE PRINCIPAL OFFENDER
SCROOGE WAS BETTER THAN HIS WORD HE DID IT ALL AND INFINITELY MORE AND TO TINY TIM WHO DID NOT DIE HE WAS A SECOND FATHER
IN HIS ACCUSTOMED VOICE AS NEAR AS HE COULD FEIGN IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMING HERE AT THIS TIME OF DAY I AM VERY SORRY SIR SAID BOB I AM BEHIND MY TIME YOU ARE REPEATED SCROOGE
OH MISTER BUMBLE REMONSTRATED MISSUS CORNEY
IF BET WAS ALL RIGHT I MEAN TO SAY THAT I SHOULDN'T REPLIED TOM ANGRILY THERE NOW AH
I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
YOU MAY FIND THEM ALL THE WAY FROM LAKE SUPERIOR TO THE SEA WITH THE SAME SQUARE STREETS AND THE SAME MAPLE TREES AND THE SAME CHURCHES AND HOTELS AND EVERYWHERE THE SUNSHINE OF THE LAND OF HOPE SIMILARLY THE REVEREND MISTER DRONE IS NOT ONE PERSON BUT ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN
I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY TO BE A NECESSARY AND UNIVERSAL ADJUNCT OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BOOK
AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
TO MAKE HIM I CLAPPED THE GAITERS OF ONE ECCLESIASTIC ROUND THE LEGS OF ANOTHER ADDED THE SERMONS OF A THIRD AND THE CHARACTER OF A FOURTH AND SO LET HIM START ON HIS WAY IN THE BOOK TO PICK UP SUCH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES AS HE MIGHT FIND FOR HIMSELF
THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
THAT WAS JEFF'S MONEY PART OF IT MULLINS GOT THE TELEGRAM FROM A BROKER OR SOMEONE AND HE SHOWED IT TO JEFF JUST AS HE WAS GOING UP THE STREET WITH AN ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK AT A BIG EMPTY LOT ON THE HILL BEHIND THE TOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR THESE INCURABLES
A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
ELSE HOW WAS IT THAT HENRY MULLINS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SELLING A DRAFT FOR FORTY THOUSAND ON NEW YORK AND WHY WAS IT THAT MISTER SMITH WOULDN'T PAY BILLY THE DESK CLERK HIS BACK WAGES WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT IT INTO CUBA OH YES SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE SEEN IT
AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
MY PARENTS MIGRATED TO CANADA IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM MY FATHER TOOK UP A FARM NEAR LAKE SIMCOE IN ONTARIO THIS WAS DURING THE HARD TIMES OF CANADIAN FARMING
THE FAULT LIES RATHER WITH AN ART THAT IS DEFICIENT THAN IN AN AFFECTION THAT IS WANTING
ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
AND MY FATHER WAS JUST ABLE BY GREAT DILIGENCE TO PAY THE HIRED MEN AND IN YEARS OF PLENTY TO RAISE ENOUGH GRAIN TO HAVE SEED FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S CROP WITHOUT BUYING ANY BY THIS PROCESS MY BROTHERS AND I WERE INEVITABLY DRIVEN OFF THE LAND
WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
COULD WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE AND BUY BOTH OF THESE BOOKS FOR SEVEN SHILLINGS YET THESE WORKS ARE OF SO HUMOROUS A CHARACTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO PRINT THEM THE COMPOSITORS FELL BACK FROM THEIR TASK SUFFOCATED WITH LAUGHTER AND GASPING FOR AIR
EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
AND BY MEANS OF THIS AND SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT BY MC GILL UNIVERSITY I SURVIVED UNTIL I TOOK THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN NINETEEN O THREE THE MEANING OF THIS DEGREE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF INSTRUCTION IS EXAMINED FOR THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND IS PRONOUNCED COMPLETELY FULL
AND NEEDS A TELLER AS FOR MISTER SMITH WITH HIS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POUNDS HIS HOARSE VOICE HIS LOUD CHECK SUIT
AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI
A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
AFTER THIS NO NEW IDEAS CAN BE IMPARTED TO HIM FROM THIS TIME AND SINCE MY MARRIAGE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THIS PERIOD I HAVE BELONGED TO THE STAFF OF MC GILL UNIVERSITY FIRST AS LECTURER IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LATER AS HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT OF ONE'S OWN MIND WORTH READING FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS AN ARDUOUS CONTRIVANCE ONLY TO BE ACHIEVED IN FORTUNATE MOMENTS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
THEY GIVE IT AWAY AND WHO DO THEY GIVE IT TO WHY TO THOSE AS DON'T WANT IT EVERY TIME THEY GIVE IT TO THESE PROFESSORS AND TO THIS RESEARCH AND THAT AND DO THE POOR GET ANY OF IT NOT A CENT AND NEVER WILL I TELL YOU BOYS CONTINUED JEFF
WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE DOCUMENTS TO WHICH HE ATTACHED SO MUCH VALUE MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMPOSED BY ANY LAD OF FIFTEEN
IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THE VIOLENT COMPRESSION OF SO POWERFUL AND ELASTIC A SPRING WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AS VIOLENT A RECOIL THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PEERS
STOOD BY HIM AT THE BAR THEY READ AS WELL AS THEY COULD SOME NOTES WHICH HE HAD SET DOWN AND EXAMINED HIS WITNESSES IT WAS TO LITTLE PURPOSE
IT WAS INDEED IN THE POWER OF THE KING BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS PREROGATIVE OF MERCY TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF THE PENAL LAWS IT MIGHT HEREAFTER BE IN HIS POWER BY DISCREET MANAGEMENT
MORE THAN TWO YEARS HAD SINCE ELAPSED CORNISH THOUGHT HIMSELF SAFE BUT THE EYE OF THE TYRANT WAS UPON HIM GOODENOUGH TERRIFIED BY THE NEAR PROSPECT OF DEATH
SUSPECTED AND WHISPERED BUT NOT FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THE DISCLOSURE INDEED COULD NOT BE MADE WITHOUT GREAT SCANDAL CHARLES HAD TIMES WITHOUT NUMBER DECLARED HIMSELF A PROTESTANT
BESIDES THESE COMMON AFTER STORM AVALANCHES THAT ARE TO BE FOUND NOT ONLY IN THE YOSEMITE BUT IN ALL THE DEEP SHEER WALLED CANYON OF THE RANGE THERE ARE TWO OTHER IMPORTANT KINDS
HE READ THEM WITH MUCH EMOTION AND REMAINED SILENT SUCH SILENCE WAS ONLY THE NATURAL EFFECT OF A STRUGGLE BETWEEN RESPECT AND VEXATION
MUST BE FILLED WITH SHAME AND INDIGNATION BY LEARNING THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN A LIE THAT WHILE HE PROFESSED TO BELONG TO THEIR COMMUNION HE HAD REALLY REGARDED THEM AS HERETICS
AGAINST THE INIQUITY WHICH AFFLICTED THE EARTH SINCE THAT TERRIBLE DAY NO WOMAN HAS SUFFERED DEATH IN ENGLAND
ON THEIR WAY DOWN THROUGH THE WOODS THEY SELDOM FAIL TO MAKE A PERFECTLY CLEAN SWEEP STRIPPING OFF THE SOIL AS WELL AS THE TREES CLEARING PATHS TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS WIDE FROM THE TIMBER LINE
AND I WAS SWISHED DOWN TO THE FOOT OF THE CANYON AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT THE WALLOWING ASCENT HAD TAKEN NEARLY ALL DAY THE DESCENT ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE WHEN THE AVALANCHE STARTED
WAS THE MOST UNPARDONABLE BURTON KNEW THIS HE DELIVERED HIMSELF UP TO THE GOVERNMENT AND HE GAVE INFORMATION AGAINST FERNLEY AND ELIZABETH GAUNT THEY WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL THE VILLAIN WHOSE LIFE THEY HAD PRESERVED
RUNNING CRYSTAL CLEAR DEEP AND FULL BUT NOT OVERFLOWING THEIR BANKS ABOUT AS DEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT AS THE DAY THE DIFFERENCE IN VOLUME SO MARKED IN SPRING BEING NOW TOO SLIGHT TO BE NOTICED
RUMSEY'S STORY WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE STORY WHICH HE HAD TOLD WHEN HE APPEARED AS A WITNESS AGAINST LORD RUSSELL BUT THESE THINGS WERE URGED IN VAIN ON THE BENCH SATE THREE JUDGES WHO HAD BEEN WITH JEFFREYS IN THE WEST
THEN THE DENSE MASSES ON THE ENDS OF THE LEAFY BRANCHES BEGIN TO SHIFT AND FALL THOSE FROM THE UPPER BRANCHES STRIKING THE LOWER ONES IN SUCCESSION ENVELOPING EACH TREE IN A HOLLOW CONICAL AVALANCHE OF FAIRY FINENESS
BOTH WERE IMPELLED BY THE STRONGEST PRESSURE OF HOPE END FEAR TO CRIMINATE HIM EVIDENCE WAS PRODUCED
AND PILING THEIR UPROOTED TREES HEAD DOWNWARD IN ROWS ALONG THE SIDES OF THE GAPS LIKE LATERAL MORAINES SCARS AND BROKEN BRANCHES OF THE TREES STANDING ON THE SIDES OF THE GAPS RECORD THE DEPTH OF THE OVERWHELMING FLOOD
ON NO PART OF THE RUSH WAS I BURIED I WAS ONLY MODERATELY IMBEDDED ON THE SURFACE OR AT TIMES A LITTLE BELOW IT AND COVERED WITH A VEIL OF BACK STREAMING DUST PARTICLES
IS A TASTE WHICH EVEN MEN NOT NATURALLY CRUEL MAY BY HABIT SPEEDILY ACQUIRE THE BAR AND THE BENCH UNITED TO BROWBEAT THE UNFORTUNATE WHIG THE JURY NAMED BY A COURTLY SHERIFF
THE GOVERNMENT WAS BENT ON DESTROYING A VICTIM OF NO HIGH RANK A SURGEON IN THE CITY NAMED BATEMAN HE HAD ATTENDED SHAFTESBURY PROFESSIONALLY AND HAD BEEN A ZEALOUS EXCLUSIONIST
THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY A CRUEL EXPERIENCE THAT THE ANTIPATHY OF THE NATION TO THEIR RELIGION WAS NOT A FANCY WHICH WOULD YIELD TO THE MANDATE OF A PRINCE BUT A PROFOUND SENTIMENT
WHILE THE RELIEVED BRANCHES SPRING UP AND WAVE WITH STARTLING EFFECT IN THE GENERAL STILLNESS AS IF EACH TREE WAS MOVING OF ITS OWN VOLITION HUNDREDS OF BROAD CLOUD SHAPED MASSES MAY ALSO BE SEEN
GUILTY OF SO SLIGHT AN OFFENCE WAS HUNTED DOWN WHILE TRAITORS FAR MORE CRIMINAL AND FAR MORE EMINENT WERE ALLOWED TO RANSOM THEMSELVES BY GIVING EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM SEEMED TO REQUIRE EXPLANATION AND A DISGRACEFUL EXPLANATION WAS FOUND
THEN AWAY IN GRAND STYLE GO THE PONDEROUS ICY MASSES WITHOUT ANY FINE SNOW DUST THOSE OF CLOUDS REST DESCEND LIKE THUNDERBOLTS FOR MORE THAN A MILE
AS A CALUMNY WHICH PAPISTS AND WHIGS HAD FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS A COMMON INTEREST IN CIRCULATING JAMES NOW TOOK A STEP WHICH GREATLY DISCONCERTED THE WHOLE ANGLICAN PARTY
BORDERING ON HIGH TREASON FROM HIS INDICTMENT AND FROM THE SCANTY ACCOUNT WHICH REMAINS OF HIS TRIAL IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HE WAS NOT EVEN ACCUSED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE DESIGN OF MURDERING THE ROYAL BROTHERS THE MALIGNITY WITH WHICH SO OBSCURE A MAN
HER POLITICAL AND THEOLOGICAL OPINIONS AS WELL AS HER COMPASSIONATE DISPOSITION LED HER TO DO EVERYTHING IN HER POWER FOR BURTON SHE PROCURED A BOAT WHICH TOOK HIM TO GRAVESEND WHERE HE GOT ON BOARD OF A SHIP
IN THAT THEY WERE IMPLACABLE ENEMIES OF THAT GOOD CAUSE WHICH WOULD YET REVIVE AND FLOURISH SHE LEFT THEM TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE KING OF KINGS TO THE LAST SHE PRESERVED A TRANQUIL COURAGE WHICH REMINDED THE SPECTATORS OF THE MOST HEROIC DEATHS
HAD BEGUN TO FEEL PAINFUL MISGIVINGS AND OCCASIONALLY VENTURED TO HINT A SMALL PART OF WHAT THEY FELT DURING MANY YEARS THE ZEAL OF THE ENGLISH TORY FOR HEREDITARY MONARCHY
THESE STATESMEN AND THE GREAT PARTY WHICH THEY REPRESENTED HAD TO SUFFER A CRUEL MORTIFICATION THAT THE LATE KING HAD BEEN AT HEART A ROMAN CATHOLIC HAD BEEN DURING SOME MONTHS
BEGINNING TO RISE TOWARDS SUNDOWN JUST WHEN THE STREAMS ON THE FOUNTAINS ARE BEGINNING TO DIMINISH THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME OF THE DAILY RISE AND FALL BEING CAUSED BY THE DISTANCE THE UPPER FLOOD STREAMS HAVE TO TRAVEL BEFORE REACHING THE VALLEY
CHAPTER THREE SNOW STORMS AS HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED THE FIRST OF THE GREAT SNOW STORMS THAT REPLENISH THE YOSEMITE FOUNTAINS
THE PAPISTS CLAIMED THE DECEASED PRINCE AS THEIR PROSELYTE THE WHIGS EXECRATED HIM AS A HYPOCRITE AND A RENEGADE THE TORIES REGARDED THE REPORT OF HIS APOSTASY
AND HAD OF HIS OWN ACCORD
FOR THE MEMORY OF HIS DECEASED MASTER THIS PLEA THE KING CONSIDERED AS THE SUBTERFUGE
HE WAS SAVED FROM DEATH BY AN ANCIENT MATRON OF THE BAPTIST PERSUASION NAMED ELIZABETH GAUNT THIS WOMAN
DISTRACTED BETWEEN TWO DUTIES EQUALLY SACRED BETWEEN TWO AFFECTIONS EQUALLY ARDENT HOW WAS HE TO GIVE TO CAESAR ALL THAT WAS CAESAR'S AND YET TO WITHHOLD FROM GOD NO PART OF WHAT WAS GOD'S
THEY ARE NOW FED ONLY BY SMALL SPRINGS WHOSE WATERS ARE MOSTLY EVAPORATED IN PASSING OVER MILES OF WARM PAVEMENTS AND IN FEELING THEIR WAY SLOWLY FROM POOL TO POOL THROUGH THE MIDST OF BOULDERS AND SAND
I KNEW THE CLIMB WOULD REQUIRE A LONG TIME SOME THREE OR FOUR HOURS AS I ESTIMATED BUT IT PROVED FAR MORE DIFFICULT THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED MOST OF THE WAY I SANK WAIST DEEP
WHATEVER CONFLICTS THEREFORE THE HONEST CAVALIER MIGHT HAVE HAD TO MAINTAIN AGAINST WHIGS AND ROUNDHEADS HE HAD AT LEAST BEEN HITHERTO UNDISTURBED BY CONFLICT IN HIS OWN MIND
AND APPEARED TO BE IN HIS HANDWRITING THESE PAPERS JAMES SHOWED TRIUMPHANTLY TO SEVERAL PROTESTANTS AND DECLARED THAT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE HIS BROTHER HAD LIVED AND DIED
MANY THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT THESE JUDGMENTS SHOULD BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION BUT THE KING WAS WITHOUT PITY FERNLEY WAS HANGED ELIZABETH GAUNT WAS BURNED ALIVE AT TYBURN ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH CORNISH
HAD THE HEART AND THE FOREHEAD TO APPEAR AS THE PRINCIPAL WITNESS AGAINST THEM THEY WERE CONVICTED FERNLEY WAS SENTENCED TO THE GALLOWS ELIZABETH GAUNT TO THE STAKE EVEN AFTER ALL THE HORRORS OF THAT YEAR
OF OBTAINING AT ONCE GREATNESS AND REVENGE BUT NEITHER FANATICISM NOR AMBITION NEITHER RESENTMENT FOR PAST WRONGS NOR THE INTOXICATION PRODUCED BY SUDDEN GOOD FORTUNE
NOT TO BE FORGIVEN BATEMAN WAS ARRESTED AND INDICTED THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM WERE MEN OF INFAMOUS CHARACTER MEN TOO WHO WERE SWEARING FOR THEIR OWN LIVES NONE OF THEM HAD YET GOT HIS PARDON
BUT JAMES SUPPOSED THAT THE PRIMATE WAS STRUCK DUMB BY THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCE OF REASON AND EAGERLY CHALLENGED HIS GRACE TO PRODUCE WITH THE HELP OF THE WHOLE EPISCOPAL BENCH A SATISFACTORY REPLY
WITH THESE DISTINGUISHED LEADERS ALL THE NOBLEST AND MOST OPULENT MEMBERS OF THEIR CHURCH CONCURRED EXCEPT LORD ARUNDELL OF WARDOUR AN OLD MAN
RUNNING AND SINGING SOON AFTER SUNRISE LOUDER AND LOUDER WITH INCREASING VOLUME UNTIL SUNDOWN THEN THEY GRADUALLY FAIL THROUGH THE FROSTY HOURS OF THE NIGHT
BEFORE THE SUNSHINE HAD TIME TO CHANGE THEM I SET OUT EARLY TO CLIMB BY A SIDE CANYON TO THE TOP OF A COMMANDING RIDGE A LITTLE OVER THREE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LOOSENESS OF THE SNOW THAT BLOCKED THE CANYON
THE GROWTH OF FIVE GENERATIONS DIFFUSED THROUGH ALL RANKS AND PARTIES AND INTERTWINED NOT LESS CLOSELY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE TORY THAN WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WHIG
ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT IN SOME PLACES AFTER SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY TO WITHIN HALF AN HOUR OR SO OF SUNDOWN I WAS STILL SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE SUMMIT THEN MY HOPES WERE REDUCED
JAMES HIMSELF DISTRIBUTED THE WHOLE EDITION AMONG HIS COURTIERS AND AMONG THE PEOPLE OF HUMBLER RANK WHO CROWDED ROUND HIS COACH HE GAVE ONE COPY TO A YOUNG WOMAN OF MEAN CONDITION
THOUGH AT SUCH TIMES ONE THINKS FAST ONE FINE YOSEMITE MORNING AFTER A HEAVY SNOWFALL BEING EAGER TO SEE AS MANY AVALANCHES AS POSSIBLE AND WIDE VIEWS OF THE FOREST AND SUMMIT PEAKS IN THEIR NEW WHITE ROBES
AND HIS ZEAL FOR THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION HAD GROWN UP TOGETHER AND HAD STRENGTHENED EACH OTHER IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE TWO SENTIMENTS WHICH SEEMED INSEPARABLE AND EVEN IDENTICAL
COULD PREVENT THE MOST EMINENT ROMAN CATHOLICS FROM PERCEIVING THAT THE PROSPERITY WHICH THEY AT LENGTH ENJOYED WAS ONLY TEMPORARY AND UNLESS WISELY USED MIGHT BE FATAL TO THEM
I PERSUADED REGINALD TO GO TO THE MC KILLOPS GARDEN PARTY AGAINST HIS WILL WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES OCCASIONALLY THEY KNOW YOU'RE HERE AND THEY'LL THINK IT SO FUNNY IF YOU DON'T GO AND I WANT PARTICULARLY TO BE IN WITH MISSUS MC KILLOP JUST NOW
SO DISTRESSING FOR THE POOR SOMEONE HAS OBSERVED THAT PROVIDENCE IS ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF THE BIG DIVIDENDS REMARKED REGINALD THE DUCHESS ATE AN ANCHOVY IN A SHOCKED MANNER
DARE SET FOOT IN HER HOUSE AGAIN AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT THE CROQUET PLAYERS FINISHED THEIR GAME WHICH HAD BEEN GOING ON WITHOUT A SYMPTOM OF FINALITY DURING THE WHOLE AFTERNOON WHY I ASK SHOULD IT HAVE STOPPED PRECISELY WHEN A COUNTER ATTRACTION WAS SO NECESSARY
SO I GOT UP THE NEXT MORNING AT EARLY DAWN I KNOW IT WAS DAWN BECAUSE THERE WERE LARK NOISES IN THE SKY AND THE GRASS LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN LEFT OUT ALL NIGHT AND HUNTED UP THE MOST CONSPICUOUS THING IN THE BIRD LINE THAT I COULD FIND
I KNOW YOU WANT ONE OF HER SMOKE PERSIAN KITTENS AS A PROSPECTIVE WIFE FOR WUMPLES OR A HUSBAND IS IT REGINALD HAS A MAGNIFICENT SCORN FOR DETAILS OTHER THAN SARTORIAL
KNOWING THAT WOMANLY INTUITION STOPS SHORT AT CLARET A WOMAN WILL CHEERFULLY CHOOSE HUSBANDS FOR HER LESS ATTRACTIVE FRIENDS OR TAKE SIDES IN A POLITICAL CONTROVERSY WITHOUT THE LEAST KNOWLEDGE OF THE ISSUES INVOLVED
I THINK IT'S MORE GENERALLY PRACTISED THAN YOU IMAGINE THE YOUNG HAVE ASPIRATIONS THAT NEVER COME TO PASS THE OLD HAVE REMINISCENCES OF WHAT NEVER HAPPENED IT'S ONLY THE MIDDLE AGED WHO ARE REALLY CONSCIOUS
THERE WERE SYMPTOMS OF A STAMPEDE THE ARCHDEACON'S WIFE LOOKED AT ME KIPLING OR SOMEONE HAS DESCRIBED SOMEWHERE THE LOOK A FOUNDERED CAMEL GIVES WHEN THE CARAVAN MOVES ON AND LEAVES IT TO ITS FATE
MISSUS RAMPAGE OCCUPIES A PROMINENT PLACE IN LOCAL TEMPERANCE MOVEMENTS AS SOON AS I HAD BROKEN UP THIS UNPROMISING TETE A TETE AND SETTLED REGINALD WHERE HE COULD WATCH THE CROQUET PLAYERS LOSING THEIR TEMPERS
YOUR COUSIN IS DISCUSSING ZAZA WITH THE ARCHDEACON'S WIFE AT LEAST HE IS DISCUSSING SHE IS ORDERING HER CARRIAGE SHE SPOKE IN THE DRY STACCATO TONE OF ONE WHO REPEATS A FRENCH EXERCISE AND I KNEW
REPENTED AT LEISURE SHE EVENTUALLY FINDS HER WAY TO INDIA AND GETS MARRIED AND COMES HOME TO ADMIRE THE ROYAL ACADEMY AND TO IMAGINE THAT AN INDIFFERENT PRAWN CURRY IS FOR EVER AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO BELIEVE IS LUNCHEON
AND WHEN HIS PRECEPTRESS SUGGESTED THAT HE MIGHT BEGIN THE STRENUOUS LIFE BY HELPING HER TO SUPERVISE THE ANNUAL OUTING OF THE BUCOLIC INFANTS WHO COMPOSED THE LOCAL CHOIR HIS EYES SHONE WITH THE DANGEROUS ENTHUSIASM OF A CONVERT
THAT'S BETTER THAN A DOMESTIC SCANDAL A WOMAN WHO LEAVES HER COOK NEVER WHOLLY RECOVERS HER POSITION IN SOCIETY I SUPPOSE THE SAME THING HOLDS GOOD WITH THE HOSTS THEY SELDOM HAVE MORE THAN A SUPERFICIAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH THEIR GUESTS
WHEN I WAS AT POONA IN SEVENTY SIX MY DEAR COLONEL PURRED REGINALD FANCY ADMITTING SUCH A THING SUCH A GIVE AWAY FOR ONE'S AGE I WOULDN'T ADMIT BEING ON THIS PLANET IN SEVENTY SIX
AFTERWARDS IT QUIETED DOWN A BIT AND WHEN ITS LEGS HAD STOPPED WAVING FAREWELLS TO THE LANDSCAPE I GOT A GARDENER BOY TO DRAG IT INTO THE HALL WHERE EVERYBODY MUST SEE IT ON THEIR WAY TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM I BREAKFASTED UPSTAIRS MYSELF
AND LAID STRESS ON HER UNASSISTED LABOURS IN PARISH WORK HER MENTAL LONELINESS HER DISCOURAGEMENTS AND AT THE RIGHT MOMENT SHE PRODUCED STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM REGINALD WAS OBVIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THE LATTER
FORETHOUGHT HAD PROVIDED THE OCCASION WITH A SUPPLY OF TIN WHISTLES BUT THE INTRODUCTION OF A HE GOAT FROM A NEIGHBOURING ORCHARD WAS A BRILLIANT AFTERTHOUGHT PROPERLY REGINALD EXPLAINED
AND SO OFTEN JUST WHEN THEY DO GET TO KNOW YOU A BIT BETTER THEY LEAVE OFF KNOWING YOU ALTOGETHER THERE WAS RATHER A BREATH OF WINTER IN THE AIR WHEN I LEFT THOSE DORSETSHIRE PEOPLE YOU SEE THEY HAD ASKED ME DOWN TO SHOOT AND
REGINALD PUCKERED HIS BROW INTO A TORTURED FROWN AND I KNEW THAT MY POINT WAS GAINED HE WAS DEBATING WHAT TIE WOULD GO WITH WHICH WAISTCOAT EVEN THEN I HAD MY MISGIVINGS
IN THESE DAYS OF THE OVER EDUCATION OF WOMEN SHE'S QUITE REFRESHING THEY SAY SOME PEOPLE WENT THROUGH THE SIEGE OF PARIS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT FRANCE AND GERMANY WERE AT WAR
I PLAYED MY LAST CARD REGINALD IT'S GETTING LATE AND A SEA MIST IS COMING ON I KNEW THAT THE ELABORATE CURL OVER HIS RIGHT EYEBROW WAS NOT GUARANTEED TO SURVIVE A SEA MIST NEVER
AS IF THEY WERE ANGELS OF DEATH ENTERING A PLAGUE CITY YOU SEE THAT TYPE OF BRITON VERY MUCH IN HOTELS ABROAD AND NOWADAYS THERE ARE ALWAYS THE JOHANNESBOURGEOIS WHO BRING A CAPE TO CAIRO ATMOSPHERE WITH THEM WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE
NOTHING MORE IS DEMANDED OF YOU REGINALD SHUT HIS EYES THERE WILL BE THE EXHAUSTINGLY UP TO DATE YOUNG WOMEN WHO WILL ASK ME IF I HAVE SEEN SAN TOY A LESS PROGRESSIVE GRADE WHO WILL YEARN TO HEAR ABOUT THE DIAMOND JUBILEE THE HISTORIC EVENT
AS IT WAS THOSE WHO HAD SPOTTED HANDKERCHIEFS WERE ALLOWED TO WEAR THEM WHICH THEY DID WITH THANKFULNESS REGINALD RECOGNISED THE IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE TIME AT HIS DISPOSAL
REGINALD CALLED IT A DISPENSATION IT HAD BEEN THE DREAM OF HIS LIFE TO STAGE MANAGE A CHOIR OUTING WITH STRATEGIC INSIGHT HE LED HIS SHY BULLET HEADED CHARGES TO THE NEAREST WOODLAND STREAM AND ALLOWED THEM TO BATHE
FOR NOT BEING TENDER ENOUGH OR HAVING BEEN KEPT TOO LONG MY IDEA ABOUT THE LECTURE RESUMED THE DUCHESS HURRIEDLY IS TO INQUIRE WHETHER PROMISCUOUS CONTINENTAL TRAVEL DOESN'T TEND TO WEAKEN THE MORAL FIBRE OF THE SOCIAL CONSCIENCE
BUT ONE'S HOST AND HOSTESS ARE A SORT OF HUMAN HINTERLAND THAT ONE NEVER HAS THE TIME TO EXPLORE THERE WAS A FELLOW I STAYED WITH ONCE IN WARWICKSHIRE WHO FARMED HIS OWN LAND BUT WAS OTHERWISE QUITE STEADY
A SCANDAL MY DEAR REGINALD IS AS MUCH TO BE AVOIDED AT MONACO OR ANY OF THOSE PLACES AS AT EXETER LET US SAY SCANDAL MY DEAR IRENE I MAY CALL YOU IRENE MAYN'T I
AND THEN HE BECAME A TRAPPIST MONK AND THE YOUNGEST WHO WAS INTENDED FOR THE AMERICAN MARRIAGE MARKET HAS DEVELOPED POLITICAL TENDENCIES AND WRITES PAMPHLETS ABOUT THE HOUSING OF THE POOR
JUST WHEN I WAS DOING MY BEST TO UNDERSTAND HALF THE THINGS I WAS SAYING BEING ASKED BY ONE OF THOSE SEEKERS AFTER COUNTRY HOME TRUTHS HOW MANY FOWLS SHE COULD KEEP IN A RUN TEN FEET BY SIX OR WHATEVER IT WAS
SHE FEELS IT VERY KEENLY BUT SHE ALWAYS MAINTAINS A CHEERFUL APPETITE WHICH I THINK IS SO UNSELFISH OF HER THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING DISAPPOINTMENT THERE WAS A GIRL I KNEW WHO NURSED A WEALTHY UNCLE THROUGH A LONG ILLNESS BORNE BY HER
BUT NO WOMAN EVER CHEERFULLY CHOSE A CLARET HORS D'OEUVRES HAVE ALWAYS A PATHETIC INTEREST FOR ME SAID REGINALD
GASPED AMABEL UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A WORLD OF TROUBLE I TAKE IN TRYING TO RIVAL THE LILIES IN THEIR ARTISTIC SIMPLICITY
TO SEE IF A NEW STRAWBERRY HAS HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT REGINALD RECALLED THE LILIES OF THE FIELD WHICH SIMPLY SAT AND LOOKED BEAUTIFUL AND DEFIED COMPETITION BUT THAT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE FOR US TO FOLLOW
THOSE PEOPLE WITH HER ARE THE WHIMPLES VERY OLD ACQUAINTANCES OF MINE THEY'RE ALWAYS HAVING TROUBLE POOR THINGS TROUBLE IS NOT ONE OF THOSE FANCIES YOU CAN TAKE UP AND DROP AT ANY MOMENT
IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO COME AFTER US WE MAY BE REMEMBERED FOR QUALITIES AND SUCCESSES WHICH WE QUITE LEFT OUT OF THE RECKONING IT'S NOT ALWAYS SAFE TO DEPEND ON THE COMMEMORATIVE TENDENCIES OF THOSE WHO COME AFTER US
I WANDERED OFF TO FIND MY HOSTESS AND RENEW THE KITTEN NEGOTIATIONS AT THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED I DID NOT SUCCEED IN RUNNING HER DOWN AT ONCE AND EVENTUALLY IT WAS MISSUS MC KILLOP WHO SOUGHT ME OUT AND HER CONVERSATION WAS NOT OF KITTENS
AND HAD PROMISED TO LEND HER THE ETERNAL CITY AND MY RECIPE FOR RABBIT MAYONNAISE
I'M SURE IN MY NERVOUSNESS I SHOULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT LEMONS STILL I DARESAY THEY WOULD BE QUITE AS OFFENDED IF ONE HADN'T EATEN THEM I KNOW IF I WERE SERVED UP AT A CANNIBAL FEAST I SHOULD BE DREADFULLY ANNOYED IF ANYONE FOUND FAULT WITH ME
REGINALD'S CHOIR TREAT NEVER WROTE REGINALD TO HIS MOST DARLING FRIEND BE A PIONEER IT'S THE EARLY CHRISTIAN THAT GETS THE FATTEST LION REGINALD IN HIS WAY
AND REGINALD IGNORING MY EFFORTS TO INTERCEPT HIM GLIDED AWAY TO ANOTHER PART OF THE LAWN I FOUND HIM A FEW MINUTES LATER HAPPILY ENGAGED IN TEACHING THE YOUNGEST RAMPAGE BOY THE APPROVED THEORY OF MIXING ABSINTHE WITHIN FULL EARSHOT OF HIS MOTHER
YOU ARE OF NECESSITY INTELLECTUAL ALSO SHE HAD BEEN TWICE TO FECAMP TO PICK UP A GOOD FRENCH ACCENT FROM THE AMERICANS STAYING THERE CONSEQUENTLY SHE HAD A KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD
AND WE MUST GET OUR IDEAS FROM SOMEWHERE I SUPPOSE EVEN THE HOOLIGAN WAS PROBABLY INVENTED IN CHINA CENTURIES BEFORE WE THOUGHT OF HIM ENGLAND MUST WAKE UP AS THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE SAID THE OTHER DAY WASN'T IT
AMABEL WAS ACCOUNTED A BEAUTY AND INTELLECTUALLY GIFTED SHE NEVER PLAYED TENNIS AND WAS REPUTED TO HAVE READ MAETERLINCK'S LIFE OF THE BEE IF YOU ABSTAIN FROM TENNIS AND READ MAETERLINCK IN A SMALL COUNTRY VILLAGE
THERE ARE PEOPLE ONE KNOWS QUITE NICE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE IN ENGLAND WHO ARE SO DIFFERENT WHEN THEY ARE ANYWHERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL THE PEOPLE WITH WHAT I CALL
ONE GETS TO KNOW THEIR FOX TERRIERS AND THEIR CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND WHETHER THE STORY ABOUT THE GO CART CAN BE TURNED LOOSE IN THE DRAWING ROOM OR MUST BE TOLD PRIVATELY TO EACH MEMBER OF THE PARTY FOR FEAR OF SHOCKING PUBLIC OPINION
SHOULD NEVER HAVE SUSPECTED HIM OF HAVING A SOUL YET NOT VERY LONG AFTERWARDS HE ELOPED WITH A LION TAMER'S WIDOW AND SET UP AS A GOLF INSTRUCTOR SOMEWHERE ON THE PERSIAN GULF DREADFULLY IMMORAL OF COURSE BECAUSE HE WAS ONLY AN INDIFFERENT PLAYER
OF THEIR LIMITATIONS THAT IS WHY ONE SHOULD BE SO PATIENT WITH THEM BUT ONE NEVER IS AFTER ALL SAID THE DUCHESS THE DISILLUSIONS OF LIFE MAY DEPEND ON OUR WAY OF ASSESSING IT
I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN ME LONG ENOUGH FOR THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU LONGER THAN YOUR GOD PARENTS HAD WHEN THEY TOOK THE LIBERTY OF CALLING YOU THAT NAME SCANDAL IS MERELY THE COMPASSIONATE ALLOWANCE WHICH THE GAY MAKE TO THE HUMDRUM
AND I AM EXPECTED TO UNDERGO SOCIAL MARTYRDOM TO SUIT THE CONNUBIAL EXIGENCIES REGINALD IT'S NOTHING OF THE KIND ONLY I'M SURE MISSUS MC KILLOP WOULD BE PLEASED IF I BROUGHT YOU YOUNG MEN OF YOUR BRILLIANT ATTRACTIONS ARE RATHER AT A PREMIUM AT HER GARDEN PARTIES
THINK HOW MANY BLAMELESS LIVES ARE BRIGHTENED BY THE BLAZING INDISCRETIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE TELL ME WHO IS THE WOMAN WITH THE OLD LACE AT THE TABLE ON OUR LEFT OH THAT DOESN'T MATTER
I SUPPOSE IT'S UNLUCKY TO BRING PEACOCK'S FEATHERS INTO A HOUSE ANYWAY THERE WAS A BLUE PENCILLY LOOK IN MY HOSTESS'S EYE WHEN I TOOK MY DEPARTURE SOME HOSTESSES OF COURSE WILL FORGIVE ANYTHING EVEN UNTO PAVONICIDE
IS THERE SUCH A WORD AS LONG AS ONE IS NICE LOOKING AND SUFFICIENTLY UNUSUAL TO COUNTERBALANCE SOME OF THE OTHERS AND THERE ARE OTHERS THE GIRL FOR INSTANCE WHO READS MEREDITH
TO PREVENT PLUNDERING INCURSIONS ON THE PART OF THE ATHENIANS AT PLEMMYRIUM
WAS IN THE FIELD AND DILIGENTLY PROSECUTING THE WAR GREAT MISCHIEF WAS THEREFORE DONE TO THE ATHENIANS THEY WERE DEPRIVED OF THEIR WHOLE COUNTRY MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND SLAVES HAD DESERTED A GREAT PART OF THEM ARTISANS AND ALL THEIR SHEEP AND BEASTS OF BURDEN WERE LOST
TO BE TOLD THE BEST SIDE OF THINGS AND THEN TO BLAME THE TELLER IF THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH HE HAS RAISED IN YOUR MINDS ARE NOT ANSWERED BY THE RESULT AND I THEREFORE THOUGHT IT SAFEST TO DECLARE TO YOU THE TRUTH
THAT MIGHT AGREE TO JOIN THEM GO TO SYRACUSE BY LAND FINALLY THEY DETERMINED TO SAIL FOR HIMERA
SAYING THAT THE LATTER HAD NOT INHERITED THEIR NAVAL PROWESS NOR WOULD THEY RETAIN IT FOR EVER
AND ALLIES SAILING OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
AND SO TO PROCEED WITHOUT DELAY TO SICILY WHILE CHARICLES WAITED UNTIL HE HAD COMPLETED THE FORTIFICATION OF THE PLACE AND LEAVING A GARRISON THERE RETURNED HOME SUBSEQUENTLY WITH HIS THIRTY SHIPS AND THE ARGIVES ALSO
AND THE ATHENIANS IF HARD PRESSED BY CROWDING TOGETHER IN A SMALL SPACE AND ALL TO THE SAME POINT WOULD RUN FOUL OF ONE ANOTHER
OR FREEDMEN SIX HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY IN ALL UNDER THE COMMAND OF ECCRITUS
SUDDENLY THE SYRACUSANS HAD MANNED THEIR SHIPS AND AGAIN SAILED AGAINST THEM AND THE ATHENIANS IN GREAT CONFUSION AND MOST OF THEM FASTING GOT ON BOARD AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PUT OUT TO MEET THEM FOR SOME TIME BOTH PARTIES REMAINED ON THE DEFENSIVE WITHOUT ENGAGING
IN ANY WAY THAT MIGHT OFFER EITHER IN MERCHANT VESSELS OR TRANSPORTS OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER LIKELY TO PROVE SUCCESSFUL
THUS FULFILLING THE OBJECT FOR WHICH THEY HAD BEEN MANNED ORIGINALLY WHICH WAS TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE ATHENIANS FROM THE MERCHANTMEN TO THE GALLEYS
THE ATHENIANS NOW SAILED BACK TO NAUPACTUS AND THE CORINTHIANS IMMEDIATELY SET UP A TROPHY AS VICTORS BECAUSE THEY HAD DISABLED A GREATER NUMBER OF THE ENEMY'S SHIPS
WHO NOT ONLY ROUTED THE SQUADRON IN QUESTION BUT ALSO THAT BY WHICH THEY WERE AT FIRST BEING DEFEATED IN THE HARBOUR SINKING ELEVEN OF THE SYRACUSAN VESSELS AND KILLING MOST OF THE MEN EXCEPT THE CREWS OF THREE SHIPS WHOM THEY MADE PRISONERS
WHICH NO ONE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE IF HE HAD HEARD OF IT BEFORE IT HAD COME TO PASS FOR COULD ANY ONE HAVE IMAGINED THAT EVEN WHEN BESIEGED BY THE PELOPONNESIANS ENTRENCHED IN ATTICA THEY WOULD STILL INSTEAD OF WITHDRAWING FROM SICILY
FROM THEIR BEING MORE USED TO SAIL ROUND AND CHARGE THE ENEMY'S SIDE THAN TO MEET HIM PROW TO PROW
REST OF THE TIME THE ENEMY WAS NOW PERMANENTLY FIXED IN ATTICA AT ONE TIME IT WAS AN ATTACK IN FORCE AT ANOTHER IT WAS THE REGULAR GARRISON
WHILE WITH RESPECT TO MORAL ADVANTAGES IT WERE INTOLERABLE
PROMONTORY AND STARTING FROM THENCE
NOW NICIAS AND THE ATHENIANS HELD THE OPINION THAT EVEN IF THE SYRACUSANS SHOULD NOT WISH TO OFFER BATTLE IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO PREVENT THE BUILDING OF THE CROSS WALL AS IT ALREADY
WERE HAVING THE BEST OF IT IN THE ENGAGEMENT IN THE GREAT HARBOUR AND SENT A FAST SAILING GALLEY TO PURSUE THEM
KING OF THE LACEDAEMONIANS THEY BEGAN BY DEVASTATING THE PARTS BORDERING UPON THE PLAIN AND NEXT PROCEEDED
INDEED ALMOST THE WHOLE OF SICILY EXCEPT THE AGRIGENTINES WHO WERE NEUTRAL NOW CEASED MERELY TO WATCH EVENTS AS IT HAD HITHERTO DONE AND ACTIVELY JOINED SYRACUSE AGAINST THE ATHENIANS WHILE THE SYRACUSANS AFTER THE SICEL DISASTER
TO THE SWORD THE PLACE NOT BEING WITHIN SIGHT OF THE ATHENIANS
MAKING IT HIS AIM NOW TO KEEP ON THE DEFENSIVE AND TO AVOID ANY UNNECESSARY DANGER
ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THEM ABOUT LOCRIS AND RHEGIUM AND THE APPROACH TO SICILY GYLIPPUS MEANWHILE WENT ON WITH THE WALL ACROSS EPIPOLAE USING THE STONES WHICH THE ATHENIANS HAD LAID DOWN
FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER THAT ANY SHIP THAT WAS HARD PRESSED MIGHT BE ABLE TO RETREAT IN SAFETY AND SAIL OUT AGAIN AT LEISURE THESE PREPARATIONS OCCUPIED THE ATHENIANS ALL DAY UNTIL NIGHTFALL
IT WOULD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE THE LOSSES WHICH OUR CREWS HAVE SUFFERED AND STILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER ARISE FROM THE FOLLOWING CAUSES
ABOUT TWO MILES AND A QUARTER FROM ERINEUS THE CORINTHIAN STATION THIS WAS THE TERMINATION
WHEN THE ATHENIANS HAD HEARD IT THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT HIS RESIGNATION BUT CHOSE HIM TWO COLLEAGUES
IN THE SAME WAY AS THE CORINTHIANS HAD ALTERED THEIR PROWS BEFORE ENGAGING THE SQUADRON AT NAUPACTUS THE SYRACUSANS THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD THUS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE ATHENIAN VESSELS WHICH WERE NOT CONSTRUCTED WITH EQUAL STRENGTH BUT WERE SLIGHT IN THE BOWS
SO THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO SAIL UP FOR FEAR OF RUNNING THE SHIPS UPON THEM JUST AS UPON A REEF THROUGH NOT SEEING THEM HOWEVER DIVERS WENT DOWN AND SAWED OFF EVEN THESE FOR REWARD ALTHOUGH THE SYRACUSANS DROVE IN OTHERS
THEIR OWN LOSS WAS CONFINED TO THREE VESSELS AND AFTER HAULING ASHORE THE SYRACUSAN WRECKS AND SETTING UP A TROPHY UPON THE
AND MEANWHILE PREPARED FOR THE MUSTER OF THEIR FORCES
WE HAVE NOW THEREFORE BEEN FORCED BY THE NUMBERS OF THOSE OPPOSED TO US TO DISCONTINUE THE WORK OF CIRCUMVALLATION AND TO REMAIN INACTIVE BEING UNABLE TO MAKE USE EVEN OF ALL THE FORCE WE HAVE SINCE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR HEAVY INFANTRY
AND THAT ONLY FOR A LITTLE WAY AND IN THE LITTLE SPACE IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN CAMP
DURING THE WINTER WITH THE MONEY FOR THE ARMY
MEANWHILE THE SYRACUSANS SENT EMBASSIES TO THE CITIES COMPOSED OF CORINTHIANS AMBRACIOTS AND LACEDAEMONIANS
THEIR COUNTRYMEN AT HOME SENT OFF AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE HEAVY INFANTRY IN THE MERCHANT VESSELS TO SICILY THE LACEDAEMONIANS FURNISHING A PICKED FORCE OF HELOTS AND
SOME LIGHT TROOPS AND CAVALRY FROM SELINUS A FEW GELOANS AND SICELS NUMBERING A THOUSAND IN ALL AND SET OUT ON HIS MARCH FOR SYRACUSE
BUT ARE COMPELLED TO DEPEND BOTH FOR SUPPLYING THE CREWS IN SERVICE
FOR REINFORCEMENTS WHILE THE SYRACUSANS PROCEEDED TO MAN A FLEET AND TO EXERCISE MEANING TO TRY THEIR FORTUNE IN THIS WAY ALSO AND GENERALLY BECAME EXCEEDINGLY CONFIDENT NICIAS PERCEIVING THIS AND SEEING THE STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY AND HIS OWN DIFFICULTIES DAILY INCREASING
AND PASSED THE NIGHT THERE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE LED OUT THE MAIN BODY OF HIS ARMY AND DRAWING THEM UP IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE WALLS OF THE ATHENIANS TO PREVENT THEIR GOING TO THE RELIEF OF ANY OTHER QUARTER DISPATCHED A STRONG FORCE AGAINST FORT LABDALUM AND TOOK IT
THIS CHARGING PROW TO PROW WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN THOUGHT WANT OF SKILL IN A HELMSMAN WOULD BE THE SYRACUSANS CHIEF MANOEUVRE AS BEING THAT WHICH THEY SHOULD FIND MOST USEFUL
PRODUCED THEIR FINANCIAL EMBARRASSMENT AND IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THEY IMPOSED UPON THEIR SUBJECTS INSTEAD OF THE TRIBUTE THE TAX OF A TWENTIETH UPON ALL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS BY SEA WHICH THEY THOUGHT WOULD BRING THEM IN MORE MONEY THEIR EXPENDITURE BEING NOW
AND NOTHING COULD BE BROUGHT IN WITHOUT FIGHTING BESIDES THE GENERAL IMPRESSION OF DISMAY AND DISCOURAGEMENT PRODUCED UPON THE ARMY AFTER THIS THE SYRACUSANS SENT OUT TWELVE SHIPS UNDER THE COMMAND OF AGATHARCHUS A SYRACUSAN
OF GYLIPPUS AND THE SYRACUSANS FORMED IN ORDER OF BATTLE GYLIPPUS HALTED AT A SHORT DISTANCE OFF AND SENT ON A HERALD TO TELL THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD EVACUATE SICILY WITH BAG AND BAGGAGE WITHIN FIVE DAYS TIME HE WAS WILLING TO MAKE A TRUCE ACCORDINGLY
THAT IS TO SAY THE HEAVY INFANTRY THAT
WITH TEN SHIPS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TALENTS OF SILVER AND INSTRUCTIONS TO TELL THE ARMY THAT REINFORCEMENTS WOULD ARRIVE AND THAT CARE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THEM
THE CAVALRY EXCEPTED AT THE DIFFERENT MILITARY POSTS OR UPON THE WALL BUT WHAT
SYRACUSAN CAVALRY THE LOSS OF OUR PREVIOUS SUPERIORITY EMBOLDENS OUR SLAVES TO DESERT OUR FOREIGN SEAMEN ARE IMPRESSED BY THE UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE OF A NAVY AGAINST US
AND TO GUARD THE COUNTRY THEIR HORSES WERE EITHER LAMED BY BEING CONSTANTLY WORKED UPON ROCKY GROUND OR WOUNDED BY THE ENEMY
AND ACCORDINGLY REMAINED THERE TO MUSTER AND REVIEW THE WHOLE ARMY TO SEE IF ANY HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND TO PREVAIL UPON THE THURIANS RESOLUTELY TO JOIN THEM IN THEIR EXPEDITION
GYLIPPUS LED OUT HIS HEAVY INFANTRY FURTHER FROM THE FORTIFICATIONS THAN ON THE FORMER OCCASION AND SO JOINED BATTLE POSTING HIS HORSE AND DARTERS UPON THE FLANK OF THE ATHENIANS IN THE OPEN SPACE WHERE THE WORKS OF THE TWO WALLS TERMINATED DURING THE ENGAGEMENT
TO PUT OUT AGAINST THEM FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT HARBOUR BESIDES THIS HE NOW BEGAN TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE WAR BY SEA SEEING THAT THE COMING OF GYLIPPUS HAD DIMINISHED THEIR HOPES BY LAND
AT THE SAME TIME THEY DISPATCHED DEMOSTHENES TO SICILY AS THEY HAD INTENDED
AND DRIVEN HEADLONG WITHIN THEIR LINES THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE SYRACUSANS CARRIED THEIR WALL UP TO THE ATHENIAN WORKS AND PASSED THEM THUS PUTTING IT OUT OF THEIR POWER ANY LONGER TO STOP THEM AND DEPRIVING THEM EVEN IF VICTORIOUS IN THE FIELD
THEY NOT HAVING LIKE THE SYRACUSANS THE WHOLE HARBOUR TO RETREAT OVER
UNTIL THE ATHENIANS AT LAST RESOLVED NOT TO LET THEMSELVES BE WORN OUT BY WAITING WHERE THEY WERE BUT TO ATTACK WITHOUT DELAY AND GIVING A CHEER WENT INTO ACTION THE SYRACUSANS RECEIVED THEM AND CHARGING PROW TO PROW AS THEY HAD INTENDED
SHOULD PUT AN END TO THE WAR THIS HE PREVENTED AND REASSURED THEM BY TELLING THEM THAT MORE VESSELS WERE STILL TO ARRIVE AND THAT GYLIPPUS SON OF CLEANDRIDAS HAD BEEN DISPATCHED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS TO TAKE THE COMMAND
UPON THEIR INEXPERIENCE HE ACCORDINGLY URGED THEM TO THROW ASIDE THEIR FEARS AND TO TRY THEIR FORTUNE AT SEA AND THE SYRACUSANS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GYLIPPUS AND HERMOCRATES AND PERHAPS SOME OTHERS MADE UP THEIR MINDS FOR THE SEA FIGHT AND BEGAN TO MAN THEIR VESSELS
WITH A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND SOMEONE TO SUCCEED ME AS A DISEASE IN THE KIDNEYS UNFITS ME FOR RETAINING MY POST I HAVE I THINK SOME CLAIM ON YOUR INDULGENCE
A CORINTHIAN HELD THE INTERVENING SPACE AND BLOCKED UP THE ENTRANCE THE ATHENIANS UNDER DIPHILUS NOW SAILED OUT AGAINST THEM WITH THIRTY THREE SHIPS FROM NAUPACTUS AND THE CORINTHIANS
TO SICILY HAD GOT READY FOR ENGAGING AND MANNING SOME ADDITIONAL VESSELS SO AS TO BE NUMERICALLY LITTLE INFERIOR
AND ACCORDINGLY SAILED TO AEGINA AND THERE WAITED FOR THE REMAINDER OF HIS ARMAMENT AND FOR CHARICLES TO FETCH THE ARGIVE TROOPS IN SICILY ABOUT THE SAME TIME IN THIS SPRING GYLIPPUS CAME TO SYRACUSE WITH AS MANY TROOPS AS HE COULD BRING FROM THE CITIES
TO SEND TO THE OFFICIALS IN THE CITY AND TELL THEM TO MOVE THE SALE MARKET AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD DOWN TO THE SEA
AFTER THIS ARRIVING AT ZACYNTHUS AND CEPHALLENIA HE TOOK A BODY OF HEAVY INFANTRY ON BOARD AND SENDING FOR SOME OF THE MESSENIANS
WHOSE CHEEKS HAD BEEN STRENGTHENED FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE AFTER AN ACTION OF THIS EVEN CHARACTER IN WHICH EITHER PARTY COULD CLAIM THE VICTORY
HERE ALSO CONON CAME TO THEM THE COMMANDER AT NAUPACTUS WITH NEWS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE CORINTHIAN SHIPS STATIONED OPPOSITE TO HIM FAR FROM GIVING OVER THE WAR WERE MEDITATING AN ENGAGEMENT
AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE SELFSAME DAY TO ATTACK THE ATHENIANS AGAIN WHEN THEY WERE NOT EXPECTING IT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ADVICE A MESSENGER WAS SENT AND THE MARKET GOT READY UPON WHICH THE SYRACUSANS SUDDENLY BACKED WATER AND WITHDREW TO THE TOWN
THUS THEY HAVE RUINED THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR NAVY NOW I NEED NOT REMIND YOU THAT THE TIME DURING WHICH A CREW IS IN ITS PRIME IS SHORT AND THAT THE NUMBER OF SAILORS WHO CAN START A SHIP ON HER WAY AND KEEP THE ROWING IN TIME IS SMALL
OF EXHAUSTING ALL OUR STRENGTH UPON THE BLOCKADE
BOEOTARCHS THE MYCALESSIANS LOST A LARGE PROPORTION OF THEIR POPULATION WHILE MYCALESSUS THUS EXPERIENCED A CALAMITY FOR ITS EXTENT AS LAMENTABLE AS ANY THAT HAPPENED IN THE WAR
AS THE ENEMY WILL OBTAIN HIS SICILIAN REINFORCEMENTS SHORTLY THOSE FROM PELOPONNESE AFTER A LONGER INTERVAL AND UNLESS YOU ATTEND TO THE MATTER THE FORMER WILL BE HERE BEFORE YOU WHILE THE LATTER WILL ELUDE YOU AS THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE SUCH WERE THE
DEMOSTHENES AND EURYMEDON ACCORDINGLY SENT TEN OF THEIR BEST SAILERS WITH CONON
WITHOUT ITS BEING LOST IN TRANSMISSION AND BE ABLE TO DECIDE UPON THE REAL FACTS OF THE CASE HIS EMISSARIES ACCORDINGLY DEPARTED WITH THE LETTER AND THE REQUISITE VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS AND HE ATTENDED TO THE AFFAIRS OF THE ARMY
AND UNAPPROACHED BY ANY IN SUDDENNESS AND IN HORROR
INDEED THEY MAY BE SEEN EXERCISING AND IT LIES WITH THEM TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND NOT HAVING TO MAINTAIN A BLOCKADE THEY HAVE GREATER FACILITIES FOR DRYING THEIR SHIPS
AND UMBORODOM WENT BACK INTO PEGANA AND AT ITS THRESHOLD THE THUNDER WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN THE DAWNCHILD TOSSED THE GOLDEN BALL FAR UP INTO THE BLUE ACROSS THE SKY AND THE SECOND MORNING SHONE UPON THE WORLD
DON'T BE ALARMED I AM NOT GOING TO PREACH I AM NOT AT ALL ALARMED EARNESTNESS IN YOU IS ANYTHING BUT ALARMING TO ME AH SAID CARTON WITH A CARELESS WAVE OF HIS HAND AS IF HE WAVED THAT AWAY ON THE DRUNKEN OCCASION IN QUESTION
SOMETIMES IN THEIR DREAMS THE WAR SCARRED WARRIORS OF SLID STILL LIFT THEIR HEADS AND CRY THEIR BATTLE CRY THEN DO DARK CLOUDS GATHER ABOUT TINTAGGON'S SWARTHY BROW AND HE STANDS OUT MENACING SEEN AFAR BY SHIPS WHERE ONCE HE CONQUERED SLID
BUT NEVER FIND THE BALL AND MEN NO LONGER HAVING LIGHT OF THE GOLDEN BALL SHALL PRAY TO THE GODS NO MORE WHO HAVING NO WORSHIP SHALL BE NO MORE THE GODS
AND IN THE DARKNESS UNDERNEATH THE WORLD HE MET THE THREE GREY TRAVELLERS AND RUSHED UPON THEM AND DROVE THEM FAR BEFORE HIM SMITING THEM WITH HIS SWORD TILL THEIR GREY CLOAKS STREAMED WITH BLOOD AND OUT OF THE MIDST OF THEM
AND FELL TOWARDS THE FIELDS AND AS INZANA STOOPED TO PICK IT UP SHE SUDDENLY HEARD THE SINGING OF ALL THE BIRDS THAT WERE
BUT THE BLACK MOUNTAINS DISGUISED THEMSELVES WITH SNOW AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL FELL DOWN TOWARDS THEM THEY TURNED THEIR PEAKS TO RUBY CRIMSON AND THEIR LAKES TO SAPPHIRES GLEAMING AMONGST SILVER
GENUINE TRUTH MISTER DARNAY TRUST ME I HAVE GONE ASIDE FROM MY PURPOSE I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR BEING FRIENDS NOW YOU KNOW ME YOU KNOW I AM INCAPABLE OF ALL THE HIGHER AND BETTER FLIGHTS OF MEN IF YOU DOUBT IT ASK STRYVER AND HE'LL TELL YOU SO
BUT TO THE GODS AS THEY SAT UPON THEIR HILLTOPS A NEW CRY CAME CRYING OVER THE GREEN SPACES THAT LAY BELOW THE HILLS AND THE GODS SAID THIS IS NEITHER THE CRY OF LIFE NOR YET THE WHISPER OF DEATH
AND THE GOLDEN BALL ROLLED FREE PASSING UNDER THE SHATTERED EARTH AND SO ROLLED BACK TO PEGANA AND LIMPANG TUNG CAME HOME TO THE ONYX STEP AND TOOK THE DAWNCHILD BY THE HAND AND TOLD NOT WHAT HE HAD DONE BUT SAID IT WAS THE EARTHQUAKE
ALL THE GODS MADE THEMSELVES STARS FOR TORCHES AND FAR AWAY THROUGH ALL THE SKY FOLLOWED THE TRACKS OF NIGHT AS FAR AS HE PROWLED ABROAD AND AT ONE TIME SLID WITH THE PLEIADES IN HIS HAND CAME NIGH TO THE GOLDEN BALL
AND EVER THE TRAMP OF HIS ARMIES SOUNDED NEARER AND NEARER IN THE LISTENING EARS OF THE GODS THEN THE GODS CALLED TO THEIR DOWNLANDS TO SAVE THEIR WORLD FROM SLID AND THE DOWNLANDS GATHERED THEMSELVES AND MARCHED AWAY A GREAT WHITE LINE OF GLEAMING CLIFFS
AND WHEN THE WAVES WERE SCATTERED LIKE THOSE BEFORE THEM THE FEET OF THE CLIFFS WERE NO LONGER STANDING FIRM AND THEIR FACES WERE SCARRED AND BATTERED THEN INTO EVERY CLEFT THAT STOOD IN THE ROCKS SLID SENT HIS HUGEST WAVE AND OTHERS FOLLOWED BEHIND IT
AND HIS OTHER HAND AGAINST THE HEART THAT BEAT FOR HIM I THINK CHARLES POOR MISTER CARTON DESERVES MORE CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT THAN YOU EXPRESSED FOR HIM TO NIGHT INDEED MY OWN WHY SO THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE NOT TO ASK ME
FAR OUT BEYOND THE BATTERED SHORE THAT LAY AT TINTAGGON'S FEET SLID RESTED LONG AND SENT THE NAUTILUS TO DRIFT UP AND DOWN BEFORE TINTAGGON'S EYES AND HE AND HIS ARMIES SAT SINGING IDLE SONGS OF DREAMY ISLANDS FAR AWAY TO THE SOUTH
AS THEY FLED WITH FLAPPING CLOAKS ALL RED AND GREY AND TATTERED HE LEAPT UP WITH THE GOLDEN BALL AND GAVE IT TO THE DAWNCHILD AGAIN INZANA TOSSED THE BALL INTO THE SKY MAKING THE THIRD DAY AND UP AND UP IT WENT
AND ALL WENT MARCHING ON TO ASSAIL THE CLIFFS OF THE GODS AND WHEREVER THE RIVERS HAD BROKEN THE RANKS OF THE CLIFFS
TO FIND WHAT THING IT WAS THAT CALLED WITH THE NEW CRY AND TO DRIVE IT AWAY FROM THE GODS THEN ALL THE WINDS HARNESSED UP THEIR CLOUDS AND DRAVE FORTH TILL THEY CAME TO THE GREAT GREEN VALLEY THAT DIVIDES THE SOUTH IN TWAIN
GENTLE THINGS EVEN MAGNANIMOUS THINGS SHE LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PURITY OF HER FAITH IN THIS LOST MAN THAT HER HUSBAND COULD HAVE LOOKED AT HER AS SHE WAS FOR HOURS AND O MY DEAREST LOVE SHE URGED
AND UP THE VALLEYS SHALL GO UMBORODOM
THEN ON AN ONYX STEP INZANA SAT DOWN AND WEPT WHO COULD NO MORE BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER GOLDEN BALL AND AGAIN THE GODS WERE SORRY AND THE SOUTH WIND CAME TO TELL HER TALES OF MOST ENCHANTED ISLANDS TO WHOM SHE LISTENED NOT
AND GOING ACROSS THE GREEN EARTH CAME DOWN TO AMBRADY AT THE VALLEY'S EDGE AND THERE MET THE FOREMOST OF SLID'S FIERCE ARMIES CONQUERING THE WORLD AND AGAINST HIM SLID HURLED THE FORCE OF A WHOLE BAY WHICH LASHED ITSELF HIGH OVER TINTAGGON'S KNEES
AND IN HIS MIGHTY TREASURY TURNED OVER GEMS AND PEARLS AND LORDED IT OVER THE SEA AND SHE SAID O SLID WHOSE SOUL IS IN THE SEA BRING BACK MY GOLDEN BALL AND SLID STOOD UP SWARTHY AND CLAD IN SEAWEED
BUT THE SONG THAT ONCE HAD TROUBLED THE STARS WENT MOANING ON AWAKING PENT DESIRES TILL FULL AT THE FEET OF THE GODS THE MELODY FELL THEN THE BLUE RIVERS THAT LAY CURLED ASLEEP OPENED THEIR GLEAMING EYES UNCURLED THEMSELVES AND SHOOK THEIR RUSHES
AND THE PEOPLE OF SLID THE FISHES AND THE LONG EELS WENT IN AND OUT OF ARBOURS THAT ONCE WERE DEAR TO THE GODS THEN THE GODS FEARED FOR THEIR DOMINION AND TO THE INNERMOST SACRED RECESSES OF THE MOUNTAINS TO THE VERY HEART OF THE HILLS THE GODS TROOPED OFF TOGETHER
AND INZANA LOOKING UP FOUND THAT HER BALL WAS LOST AND ALL ALONE IN THE STILLNESS ONE OWL LAUGHED WHEN THE GODS HEARD INZANA CRYING FOR HER BALL THEY CLUSTERED TOGETHER ON THE THRESHOLD AND PEERED INTO THE DARK BUT SAW NO GOLDEN BALL
THERE ON THE SAND AMONG THE BATTERED NAVIES OF THE NAUTILUS AND BROKEN WEAPONS OF THE SWORDFISH HIDDEN BY DARK WATER HE FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL AND COMING UP IN THE NIGHT ALL GREEN AND DRIPPING
AND OFTEN THE SEA RETREATS FAR OUT ALONG THE SHORE AND OFTEN WAVE BY WAVE COMES MARCHING IN WITH THE SOUND OF THE TRAMPING OF ARMIES THAT ALL MAY STILL REMEMBER THE GREAT FIGHT THAT SURGED ABOUT TINTAGGON ONCE WHEN HE GUARDED THE GODS AND THE GREEN EARTH AGAINST SLID
AND CAREFULLY SHE WATCHED IT AS IT FELL BUT ALAS IT FELL WITH A SPLASH INTO THE GREAT SEA AND GLEAMED AND SHIMMERED AS IT FELL TILL THE WATERS BECAME DARK ABOVE IT AND COULD BE SEEN NO MORE AND MEN ON THE WORLD SAID
UPON AN EVENING OF THE FORGOTTEN YEARS THE GODS WERE SEATED ON THE HILLS AND ALL THE LITTLE RIVERS OF THE WORLD LAY COILED AT THEIR FEET ASLEEP
A HERON HAD SEEN IT LYING IN A POND BUT A WILD DUCK IN SOME REEDS HAD SEEN IT LAST AS SHE CAME HOME ACROSS THE HILLS AND THEN IT WAS ROLLING VERY FAR AWAY AT LAST THE COCK CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD SEEN IT LYING BENEATH THE WORLD
AND LEANING FORWARD THEY CRIED OUT TO THE BAT AS HE PASSED UP AND DOWN BAT THAT SEEST ALL THINGS WHERE IS THE GOLDEN BALL AND THOUGH THE BAT ANSWERED NONE HEARD AND NONE OF THE WINDS HAD SEEN IT NOR ANY OF THE BIRDS
WENT OUT TOWARDS THE WORLD TO FIND THE GOLDEN BALL BECAUSE INZANA WEPT AND INTO THE WORLD HE WENT TILL HE CAME TO THE NETHER CLIFFS THAT STAND BY THE INNER MOUNTAINS IN THE SOUL AND HEART OF THE EARTH WHERE THE EARTHQUAKE DWELLETH ALONE
IT IS A HUNDRED TO ONE IF I SHOULD AVAIL MYSELF OF IT FOUR TIMES IN A YEAR IT WOULD SATISFY ME I DARE SAY TO KNOW THAT I HAD IT WILL YOU TRY THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT I AM PLACED ON THE FOOTING I HAVE INDICATED
BUT HAUGHTY AND SILENT STOOD THE MOUNTAINS WHOSE PLOT HAD DARKENED THE WORLD ALL IN THE DARK AMONG THE CRAGS IN A MIGHTY CAVERN GUARDED BY TWO TWIN PEAKS AT LAST THEY FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL FOR WHICH THE DAWNCHILD WEPT
AND STREAMED AROUND HIS FLANKS AND THEN FELL AND WAS LOST TINTAGGON STILL STOOD FIRM FOR THE HONOUR AND DOMINION OF HIS LORDS THE ELDER GODS THEN SLID WENT TO TINTAGGON AND SAID LET US NOW MAKE A TRUCE
UPON MY LIFE SAID CARTON SMILING I FIND THAT EASIER TO COMPREHEND IN MY OWN MIND THAN TO CONVEY TO YOURS HOWEVER LET ME TRY YOU REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN I WAS MORE DRUNK THAN THAN USUAL
WHAT IS THIS NEW CRY THAT THE GODS HAVE NEVER COMMANDED YET WHICH COMES TO THE EARS OF THE GODS
AND BIT THE EARTH BENEATH THEM AND HURLED THEIR CRAGS ABOUT AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH ROCKS AND FALLEN HILLS AND WENT BACK RAVENING AND GROWLING INTO THE SOUL OF THE EARTH AND THERE LAY DOWN AND SLEPT AGAIN FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
ONE OF A LARGE NUMBER AS YOU KNOW I WAS INSUFFERABLE ABOUT LIKING YOU AND NOT LIKING YOU I WISH YOU WOULD FORGET IT I FORGOT IT LONG AGO
IT WAS DARK WHEN THE CHILD INZANA THE DAWN FIRST FOUND HER GOLDEN BALL THEN RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS WITH TRIPPING FEET CHALCEDONY ONYX CHALCEDONY ONYX STEP BY STEP SHE CAST HER GOLDEN BALL ACROSS THE SKY
ONE MORNING AS SLID SANG OF OLD OUTRAGEOUS WARS
WHEN THE WORLDS AND ALL BEGAN THE GODS WERE STERN AND OLD AND THEY SAW THE BEGINNING FROM UNDER EYEBROWS HOAR WITH YEARS ALL BUT INZANA THEIR CHILD WHO PLAYED WITH THE GOLDEN BALL INZANA WAS THE CHILD OF ALL THE GODS
YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY SO AS A FASHION OF SPEECH BUT I DON'T MEAN ANY FASHION OF SPEECH INDEED WHEN I SAY I WISH WE MIGHT BE FRIENDS I SCARCELY MEAN QUITE THAT EITHER
ON THE FURTHEST EDGE OF THE WORLDS AND THOU AND I ARE TO BE EQUAL LORDS WHEN THE OLD GODS ARE GONE AND THE GREEN EARTH KNOWETH SLID BEHOLD ME GLEAMING AZURE AND FAIR WITH A THOUSAND SMILES AND SWAYED BY A THOUSAND MOODS AND TINTAGGON ANSWERED
UNTIL HE CAME TO THE MOUNTAINS AFAR AND ALOOF THERE DID THE THUNDER PUT HIS NOSE TO THE ROCKS AND BAY ALONG THE VALLEYS AND FAST AT HIS HEELS FOLLOWED UMBORODOM AND THE NEARER THE HOUND THE THUNDER CAME TO THE GOLDEN BALL THE LOUDER DID HE BAY
AS TO THE GREAT SERVICE SAID CARTON
AND OVER THE BROKEN REMNANTS OF THOSE RED CLIFFS THE ARMIES OF SLID MARCHED ON AND UP THE LONG GREEN VALLEY THEN THE GODS HEARD SLID EXULTING FAR AWAY AND SINGING SONGS OF TRIUMPH OVER THEIR BATTERED CLIFFS
CHARLES DARNAY MADE SOME MENTION OF THIS CONVERSATION IN GENERAL TERMS AND SPOKE OF SYDNEY CARTON AS A PROBLEM OF CARELESSNESS AND RECKLESSNESS HE SPOKE OF HIM IN SHORT NOT BITTERLY OR MEANING TO BEAR HARD UPON HIM BUT AS ANYBODY MIGHT WHO SAW HIM AS HE SHOWED HIMSELF
AND ON THAT MORNING THE MIGHT OF ALL FIVE OCEANS LAY DEAD AT TINTAGGON'S FEET THAT WHICH SLID HAD CONQUERED HE STILL HELD AND THERE IS NOW NO LONGER A GREAT GREEN VALLEY IN THE SOUTH
THE GOLDEN BALL WENT BOUNDING UP THE SKY AND THE DAWNCHILD WITH HER FLARING HAIR STOOD LAUGHING UPON THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS AND IT WAS DAY SO GLEAMING FIELDS BELOW SAW THE FIRST OF ALL THE DAYS THAT THE GODS HAVE DESTINED
I REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN YOU FORCED ME TO CONFESS THAT YOU HAD BEEN DRINKING I REMEMBER IT TOO THE CURSE OF THOSE OCCASIONS IS HEAVY UPON ME FOR I ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM I HOPE IT MAY BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ONE DAY WHEN ALL DAYS ARE AT AN END FOR ME
AND THE GODS ON THEIR HILL TOPS HEARD ONCE MORE THE VOICE OF SLID EXULTING OVER THEIR CLIFFS ALREADY MORE THAN HALF THE WORLD LAY SUBJECT TO SLID AND STILL HIS ARMIES ADVANCED
AND FAR AWAY TROGOOL UPON THE UTTER RIM TURNED A PAGE THAT WAS NUMBERED SIX IN A CIPHER THAT NONE MIGHT READ AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL WENT THROUGH THE SKY TO GLEAM ON LANDS AND CITIES THERE CAME THE FOG TOWARDS IT
AND WENT AWAY TO SIT AT THE FEET OF THE GODS BUT INZANA WENT AND PATTED THE EARTHQUAKE ON THE HEAD FOR SHE SAID IT WAS DARK AND LONELY IN THE SOUL OF THE EARTH THEREAFTER RETURNING STEP BY STEP CHALCEDONY ONYX CHALCEDONY ONYX
HOW THE DEW HAS FALLEN AND HOW THE MISTS SET IN WITH BREEZES FROM THE STREAMS BUT THE DEW WAS THE TEARS OF THE DAWNCHILD AND THE MISTS WERE HER SIGHS
AND SEIZED IT IN HIS JAWS WHEN INZANA SAW THE ECLIPSE BEARING HER PLAYTHING AWAY SHE CRIED ALOUD TO THE THUNDER WHO BURST FROM PEGANA AND FELL HOWLING UPON THE THROAT OF THE ECLIPSE WHO DROPPED THE GOLDEN BALL AND LET IT FALL TOWARDS EARTH
AND BADE THEM MARCH AGAINST SLID AND THE CLIFFS MARCHED DOWN TILL THEY CAME AND STOOD BEFORE SLID AND LEANED THEIR HEADS FORWARD AND FROWNED AND STOOD STAUNCH TO GUARD THE LANDS OF THE GODS AGAINST THE MIGHT OF THE SEA SHUTTING SLID OFF FROM THE WORLD
CAME TOO AND WE HAD A LITTLE PARTY THE WOMAN SEEMED TO FEEL THAT THE BURDEN OF ENTERTAINMENT RESTED UPON HER AND BY WAY OF MAKING CONVERSATION SHE TOLD US THAT HER HUSBAND HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL WHO SOLD TICKETS AT A MOVING PICTURE SHOW
HAS SHE A NICE HUSBAND
HAS GONE AND MARRIED HERSELF TO A MAN AND A COUPLE OF AUTOMOBILES AND A YACHT
I'M DIVIDING MY CHICKS INTO BIG AND LITTLE SISTERS AND BROTHERS EACH BIG ONE TO HAVE A LITTLE ONE TO LOVE AND HELP AND FIGHT FOR BIG SISTER SADIE KATE HAS TO SEE THAT LITTLE SISTER GLADIOLA ALWAYS HAS HER HAIR NEATLY COMBED
BUT AFTER EACH ONE WE SEEMED TO REACH A SOLIDER BASIS OF UNDERSTANDING
AND HE NEVER SCRUBBED OUT THE TUB AND SHE
AND OUR YELLOW DINING ROOM WITH ITS FRIEZE OF BUNNIES IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT REPORT AS MANY CHEERFUL DETAILS AS POSSIBLE TO THE POOR MOTHER AFTER THIS AS SHE SEEMED TIRED
AND I NEVER COULD FIND IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD THREE NICER MEN TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THEM JUST THINK OF ALL THAT HEALTHY EXUBERANT VOLUNTEER SERVICE GOING TO WASTE UNDER THE ASYLUM'S NOSE I SUPPOSE THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS FULL OF PLENTY MORE OF IT AND I AM GOING TO MAKE IT MY BUSINESS TO DIG IT OUT
NOTHING SEEMS QUITE SO DREADFUL NOW GOOD NIGHT ANNE GOOD NIGHT DEAR
EVEN TOSSED A PILLOW MYSELF LAST SATURDAY THOSE TWO DESIRABLE FRIENDS OF PERCY'S SPENT THE WHOLE AFTERNOON PLAYING WITH MY BOYS THEY BROUGHT UP THREE RIFLES AND EACH MAN TOOK THE LEAD OF A CAMP OF INDIANS AND PASSED THE AFTERNOON IN A BOTTLE SHOOTING CONTEST
AND I COULD SEE YOU AND JERVIS PLAINLY LEANING ON THE RAIL I WAVED FRANTICALLY BUT YOU NEVER BLINKED AN EYELASH YOUR GAZE WAS FIXED IN HOMESICK CONTEMPLATION UPON THE TOP OF THE WOOLWORTH BUILDING
IT HAD BEEN A WARM SMOKY SUMMER AFTERNOON THE WORLD WAS IN A SPLENDOR OF OUT FLOWERING THE IDLE VALLEYS WERE FULL OF HAZES THE WOODWAYS WERE PRANKED WITH SHADOWS AND THE FIELDS WITH THE PURPLE OF THE ASTERS
HATES TO HAVE CHILDREN MESSING ABOUT THEY MAKE HER NERVOUS AND AS FOR TURNFELT HIMSELF THOUGH INDUSTRIOUS AND METHODICAL AND AN EXCELLENT GARDENER STILL HIS MENTAL PROCESSES ARE NOT QUITE WHAT I HAD HOPED FOR
AND SENT HER AWAY ACTUALLY UPLIFTED
BUT ANNE WOULD NOT TALK OF THESE THINGS SHE SEEMED WRAPPED IN A REVERIE IN WHICH DIANA FELT LONESOMELY THAT SHE HAD NEITHER LOT NOR PART RUBY GILLIS WAS A GREAT GIRL TO LAUGH SAID DAVY SUDDENLY
BUT AS THEY BEGAN TO GET ACQUAINTED THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE SAME BOOKS OR JOKES OR PEOPLE OR AMUSEMENTS HE WAS EXPANSIVE AND SOCIAL AND HILARIOUS AND SHE WASN'T
THE TWO BUILDING DETAILS WE DID ACCOMPLISH ARE VERY PROMISING OUR NEW LAUNDRY GROWS BETTER AND BETTER
AND HENRY PRESENTED HIMSELF HER FAMILY SCANNED HIM CLOSELY AND FOUND HIM PERFECT IN EVERY RESPECT GOOD FAMILY GOOD MORALS GOOD FINANCIAL POSITION GOOD LOOKING HELEN WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM
I HAD ALREADY ENGAGED PERCY AS AN UNDERSTUDY BUT THERE IS NO COUNTING ON A SCOTCHMAN SANDY ACCEPTED WITH UNPRECEDENTED GRACIOUSNESS
HAS HAD A BABY AND LOST HIM DIVORCED HER HUSBAND QUARRELED WITH HER FAMILY AND COME TO THE CITY TO EARN HER OWN LIVING SHE IS READING MANUSCRIPT FOR A PUBLISHING HOUSE
AND YOU CAN HEAR US WHOOP WHEN YOU GET OFF THE TRAIN TWO MILES AWAY WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT IT JUST ONE OF THE PLEASURES OF INSTITUTION LIFE COOK HAS LEFT IN THE NIGHT WHAT THE SCOTCH CALL A MOONLIGHT FLITTING
ANNE INSTANTLY MANUFACTURED A SMILE AND PUT IT ON OF COURSE I COULDN'T BE ANYTHING BUT PLEASED OVER YOUR UNSELFISH WISH TO GIVE ME PLEASURE SHE SAID SLOWLY BUT YOU KNOW I'M SO AMAZED I CAN'T REALIZE IT
WHEN HE FIRST CAME I MADE HIM FREE OF THE LIBRARY HE BEGAN AT THE CASE NEAREST THE DOOR WHICH CONTAINS THIRTY SEVEN VOLUMES OF PANSY'S WORKS
TO WORK MORE PATIENTLY TO PLAY MORE HEARTILY ALL LIFE LESSONS ARE NOT LEARNED AT COLLEGE SHE THOUGHT LIFE TEACHES THEM EVERYWHERE BUT ALAS THE FINAL WEEK OF THAT PLEASANT VACATION WAS SPOILED FOR ANNE
I FEEL JUST THE SAME I LOVED MY POOR LITTLE STORY AND I WROTE IT OUT OF THE BEST THAT WAS IN ME AND IT IS SACRILEGE TO HAVE IT DEGRADED TO THE LEVEL OF A BAKING POWDER ADVERTISEMENT
IN WHICH WE WILL NEVER USE ANY BAKING POWDER EXCEPT ROLLINGS RELIABLE OH GASPED POOR ANNE
AND HAVE LITTLE CHILDREN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS LOVED BABIES ANNE
I GO ABOUT PLANNING AND PLANNING THEIR BABY FUTURES FEELING THAT I'M CONSTRUCTING THE NATION WHATEVER BECOMES OF ME IN AFTER LIFE
AS I WAS ENTERING THROUGH THEIR REVOLVING DOORS
PLEASING VISIONS WERE ALSO BEING WOVEN AROUND PATTY'S PLACE THERE WAS A WARM PLEASANT SENSE OF HOME IN THE THOUGHT OF IT EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER LIVED THERE BUT THE SUMMER HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY ONE TOO A TIME OF GLAD LIVING WITH SUMMER SUNS AND SKIES A TIME OF KEEN DELIGHT IN WHOLESOME THINGS
I SUGGESTED A CHANGE AND SENT HIM HOME WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN BUT HE BROUGHT IT BACK IN A FEW DAYS AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
YOU KNOW HOW FOOLISH AND SILLY I AM ON OCCASIONS
YOU KNOW IT'S RATHER DREADFUL TO LAUGH IN CHURCH BUT HEAVEN WON'T BE LIKE CHURCH ALL THE TIME SAID ANNE I HOPE IT AIN'T SAID DAVY EMPHATICALLY
ANNE PRESSED HER HAND IN AN AGONY OF SYMPATHY
WHAT YOU THINK AND HOW YOU BEHAVE ARE REALLY MATTERS OF EXTREME INDIFFERENCE TO ME BE JUST AS IMPOLITE AS YOU CHOOSE S MC B DECEMBER FOURTEENTH DEAR JUDY PLEASE PEPPER YOUR LETTERS WITH STAMPS INSIDE AND OUT
AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE OUT IN THE DAMP YOU'LL COME UP SOON AGAIN YES VERY SOON AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP YOU I'LL BE SO GLAD I KNOW YOU HAVE HELPED ME ALREADY
HOW ANNE HAD ENVIED THOSE BEAUTIFUL BRAIDS IN OLD SCHOOLDAYS LAY ON EITHER SIDE OF HER SHE HAD TAKEN THE PINS OUT THEY MADE HER HEAD ACHE SHE SAID
I DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID ANNE BLANKLY DIANA CLAPPED HER HANDS
AS IF AFTER ALL DEATH HAD COME AS A KINDLY FRIEND TO LEAD HER OVER THE THRESHOLD INSTEAD OF THE GRISLY PHANTOM SHE HAD DREADED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE SAID EMPHATICALLY AFTER THE FUNERAL THAT RUBY GILLIS WAS THE HANDSOMEST CORPSE SHE EVER LAID EYES ON HER LOVELINESS
AS SHE LAY WHITE CLAD AMONG THE DELICATE FLOWERS THAT ANNE HAD PLACED ABOUT HER WAS REMEMBERED AND TALKED OF FOR YEARS IN AVONLEA RUBY HAD ALWAYS BEEN BEAUTIFUL BUT HER BEAUTY HAD BEEN OF THE EARTH EARTHY
WE'VE JUST HAD ONE OF THOSE MISERABLE DECEIVING NIGHTS COLD AND FROSTY WHEN YOU GO TO BED AND WARM AND LIFELESS WHEN YOU WAKE IN THE DARK SMOTHERED UNDER A MOUNTAIN OF BLANKETS
WAS SADIE KATE'S SKEPTICAL QUESTION BUT SANTA CLAUS IS UNDOUBTEDLY COMING THIS TIME I ASKED THE DOCTOR OUT OF POLITENESS TO PLAY THE CHIEF ROLE AT OUR CHRISTMAS TREE AND BEING CERTAIN AHEAD OF TIME THAT HE WAS GOING TO REFUSE
AND THIS PLEASANTVILLE ASYLUM IS AN ARCHITECTURAL MODEL I ACKNOWLEDGE NOW UPON SOBER REFLECTION THAT WE WERE WISE TO POSTPONE EXTENSIVE BUILDING OPERATIONS UNTIL NEXT SUMMER OF COURSE I WAS DISAPPOINTED
BUT AS SHE WENT ON PILING UP DETAIL ON DETAIL EACH TRIVIAL IN ITSELF BUT MAKING A MOUNTAINOUS TOTAL I AGREED WITH HELEN THAT IT WAS AWFUL TO KEEP IT GOING IT WASN'T REALLY A MARRIAGE IT WAS A MISTAKE
IT ISN'T THAT I LIKE HIM ANY THE LESS BUT I AM GETTING TO LIKE ORPHANS THE MORE I JUST MET OUR MEDICAL ADVISER A FEW MINUTES AGO AS HE WAS EMERGING FROM THE NURSERY
INDEED NO I SAW THE PRIZE OFFER BUT I'D NEVER DREAM OF COMPETING FOR IT
SHE REALIZED IT FULLY SHE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WOULDN'T LAUGH AT HIS JOKES I SUPPOSE MOST OLD FASHIONED ORTHODOX PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT AWFUL TO BREAK UP A MARRIAGE ON SUCH INNOCENT GROUNDS
WITH THE RETURN OF THE INDIANS TO CIVILIZED LIFE PERCY'S OCCUPATION WAS ENDED
CAST HERSELF ON HER BED AND WEPT TEARS OF SHAME AND OUTRAGED SENSIBILITY OH SHE COULD NEVER LIVE THIS DOWN NEVER GILBERT ARRIVED AT DUSK BRIMMING OVER WITH CONGRATULATIONS
WHAT I WANT MOST ARE ABOUT EIGHT NICE PRETTY SENSIBLE YOUNG WOMEN TO COME UP HERE ONE NIGHT A WEEK AND SIT BEFORE THE FIRE AND TELL STORIES WHILE THE CHICKS POP CORN I DO SO WANT TO CONTRIVE A LITTLE INDIVIDUAL PETTING FOR MY BABIES
THIS IS APROPOS OF A CALL I RECEIVED TODAY
NO ONE COULD SEE ANY REASON FOR A DIVORCE THE PATHETIC PART OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS IS THAT BOTH SHE AND HENRY WERE ADMIRABLY FITTED TO MAKE SOME ONE ELSE HAPPY THEY JUST SIMPLY DIDN'T MATCH EACH OTHER AND WHEN TWO PEOPLE DON'T MATCH ALL THE CEREMONIES IN THE WORLD CAN'T MARRY THEM
SAID RUBY INSISTENTLY YES I KNOW
FOR PRESENTLY SHE GREW CALMER AND HER SOBS CEASED
HE PAUSED IN PASSING TO MAKE A POLITE COMMENT UPON THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE WEATHER AND TO EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT I WOULD REMEMBER HIM TO MISSUS PENDLETON WHEN I WROTE
AND ALL THAT RUBY SAID WAS SO HORRIBLY TRUE SHE WAS LEAVING EVERYTHING SHE CARED FOR SHE HAD LAID UP HER TREASURES ON EARTH ONLY SHE HAD LIVED SOLELY FOR THE LITTLE THINGS OF LIFE THE THINGS THAT PASS FORGETTING THE GREAT THINGS THAT GO ONWARD INTO ETERNITY
BY ONE OF THOSE IMPISH HAPPENINGS WHICH ARE LIKE A DREAM TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BEEN WRITING ANY MORE STORIES LATELY INQUIRED MISTER HARRISON GENIALLY ONE EVENING WHEN ANNE WAS TAKING TEA WITH HIM AND MISSUS HARRISON
ANNE PUZZLED OPENED THE LETTER AND GLANCED OVER THE TYPEWRITTEN CONTENTS MISS ANNE SHIRLEY GREEN GABLES AVONLEA P E ISLAND DEAR MADAM
THE TRUSTEES MEETING LAST WEEK WENT BEAUTIFULLY THE NEW WOMEN ARE MOST HELPFUL AND ONLY THE NICE MEN CAME I AM HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE HON CY WYKOFF IS VISITING HIS MARRIED DAUGHTER IN SCRANTON I WISH SHE WOULD INVITE FATHER TO LIVE WITH HER PERMANENTLY
SPIRIT HAD NEVER SHONE THROUGH IT INTELLECT HAD NEVER REFINED IT BUT DEATH HAD TOUCHED IT AND CONSECRATED IT BRINGING OUT DELICATE MODELINGS AND PURITY OF OUTLINE NEVER SEEN BEFORE DOING WHAT LIFE AND LOVE AND GREAT SORROW
OH YES HE WOULD TOO I'M AFRAID I'M SLANDERING HIM BABIES AT LEAST BOY BABIES GROW INTO VOTERS GOOD BY SALLIE DEAREST JUDY IF YOU EXPECT A CHEERFUL LETTER FROM ME THE DAY DON'T READ THIS
BUT AT LEAST COMPARED WITH STERRY TURNFELT IS A SCHOLARD AND SPEAKING OF STERRY HE PAID US A SOCIAL CALL A FEW DAYS AGO IN QUITE A CHASTENED FRAME OF MIND IT SEEMS THAT THE RICH CITY FELLER WHOSE ESTATE HE HAS BEEN MANAGING NO LONGER NEEDS HIS SERVICES
THE PALM DREAMS OF THE PINE AND THE PINE OF THE PALM AFTER SEEING YOU OFF I TURNED BACK TO NEW YORK WITH AN AWFUL WANDER THIRST GNAWING AT MY VITALS I TOO WANTED TO BE STARTING OFF ON MY TRAVELS IN A NEW BLUE HAT
PART OF A DOCTOR'S BUSINESS TO HEAL THE SPIRIT AS WELL AS THE BODY MOST SPIRITS APPEAR TO NEED IT IN THIS WORLD MY CALLER HAS LEFT ME NEEDING IT
LIFE HELD A DIFFERENT MEANING A DEEPER PURPOSE ON THE SURFACE IT WOULD GO ON JUST THE SAME BUT THE DEEPS HAD BEEN STIRRED IT MUST NOT BE WITH HER AS WITH POOR BUTTERFLY RUBY
BUT THE SHACKS WERE SCARCELY PLANNED FOR WINTER QUARTERS
RUBY WAS STRANGELY QUIET SHE SAID NOT A WORD ABOUT PARTIES AND DRIVES AND DRESSES AND FELLOWS SHE LAY IN THE HAMMOCK WITH HER UNTOUCHED WORK BESIDE HER AND A WHITE SHAWL WRAPPED ABOUT HER THIN SHOULDERS HER LONG YELLOW BRAIDS OF HAIR
WITH A LITTLE TREMBLE IN HER VOICE AND I ASSURE YOU I APPRECIATE THE MOTIVE OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE DIANA PLEASED AND EMBARRASSED GOT HERSELF AWAY AND POOR ANNE AFTER FLINGING THE INNOCENT CHECK INTO HER BUREAU DRAWER AS IF IT WERE BLOOD MONEY
ISN'T IT FUNNY YOU'D THINK I MUST HAVE A DASH OF CREOLE OR SPANISH OR SOME WARM BLOOD IN ME SOMEWHERE BUT I'M NOTHING ON EARTH BUT A CHILLY MIXTURE OF ENGLISH AND IRISH AND SCOTCH
IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD AS JUDSON PARKER'S PATENT MEDICINE FENCE SO SPAKE ANNE LOFTILY LITTLE DREAMING OF THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION AWAITING HER THAT VERY EVENING DIANA POPPED INTO THE PORCH GABLE BRIGHT EYED AND ROSY CHEEKED CARRYING A LETTER
I WAS SURE OF IT I SENT YOUR STORY INTO THE COMPETITION ANNE
DID YOU EVER HAVE SUCH A THRILL IN THE WHOLE OF YOUR LIFE BARRING ONE OR TWO CONNECTED WITH JERVIS
THAT YOU WON'T SAID GILBERT WONDERING UNEASILY IF IT WERE THAT CONFOUNDED JUNIOR'S OPINION IN PARTICULAR OVER WHICH ANNE WAS WORRIED THE REDS WILL THINK JUST AS I THOUGHT THAT YOU BEING LIKE NINE OUT OF TEN OF US NOT OVERBURDENED WITH WORLDLY WEALTH
MERCY
PERHAPS HE HAD UNDERSTOOD SHE COULD NOT TELL BUT HER QUICK EYE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF A LONG THIN PLANK ON THE SHORE PULLING OFF ONE OF HER MITTENS SHE SHOWED HIM A LITTLE PEARL AND TURQUOISE RING HER MOTHER HAD GIVEN HER FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT
FOR A WEEK OR MORE BEVERLY HAD BEEN BEHAVING TOWARD BALDOS IN THE MOST CAVALIER FASHION HER FRIENDS HAD BEEN TEASING HER AND TO HER OWN INTENSE AMAZEMENT SHE RESENTED IT THE FACT THAT SHE FELT THE STING OF THEIR SLY TAUNTS WAS SUFFICIENT TO AROUSE IN HER THE DISTRESSING CONVICTION
THERE WERE OTHER CHANGES SUGGESTED FOR IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION AND THEN THERE WAS A GENERAL PLAN FOR THE MODERNIZING OF THE FORTRESS AT SOME MORE CONVENIENT TIME BALDOS LACONICALLY OBSERVED THAT THE EQUIPMENT WAS YEARS BEHIND THE TIMES TO THE AMAZEMENT OF THE OFFICIALS HE WAS ABLE TO TALK INTELLIGENTLY OF FORTS IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD
HE HAD PROMISED TO CALL ON LADY EILEEN ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK AND HIS MIND DWELT ON THE POTENTIALITIES OF THE INTERVIEW AS HE LINGERED OVER HIS FRUGAL MEAL HE HAD JUST POURED OUT HIS SECOND CUP WHEN THE TELEPHONE BUZZER BEHIND HIM JARRED A CALL FROM LIVERPOOL SIR SAID THE MAN IN THE PRIVATE EXCHANGE MISTER BLAKE WANTS YOU
THE TALL LEADER WITH THE RED FEATHER THE RAKISH HAT AND THE BLACK PATCH ALONE WAS MISSING FROM THE PICTURE IT'S THE STRANGEST LOOKING CREW I'VE EVER SEEN SAID ANGUISH THEY LOOK LIKE PIRATES OR GYPSIES SUGGESTED YETIVE WHO ARE THEY COLONEL QUINNOX WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE
THE PARTY RODE FORTH AT AN EARLY HOUR IN THE MORNING IT WAS HOT IN THE CITY BUT IT LOOKED COLD AND BLEAK ON THE HEIGHTS COMFORTABLE WRAPS WERE TAKEN ALONG AND PROVISION WAS MADE FOR LUNCHEON AT AN INN HALF WAY UP THE SLOPE QUINNOX REGALED BEVERLY WITH STORIES IN WHICH GRENFALL LORRY WAS THE HERO AND YETIVE THE HEROINE
TOM TOM GRAY SHE CALLED WHERE ARE YOU RUN FOR HELP CAME THE ANSWER IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE SAW THEM CLINGING TO A BROKEN LEDGE OF ICE TOM SUPPORTING JULIA CROSBY AS FOR THE JUNIOR CAPTAIN SHE WAS WEEPING BITTERLY AND MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO HELP HERSELF
A LOCAL MAN SPOTTED HER AND CAME BACK TO FETCH ME TO MAKE CERTAIN OF HER IDENTITY
AND PUFFING A RING OF SMOKE INTO THE AIR HE TOLD IN BARE UNADORNED FASHION THE EVENTS OF THE DAY IT HAS BEEN A NARROW THING FOR GRELL HE CONCLUDED EVEN NOW I FANCY WE SHALL GET HIM GREEN'S AS TENACIOUS AS A BULL DOG WHEN HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO TAKE HOLD OF
BESIDES HE IS NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE LOVE TO ME
I DON'T THINK IT LIKELY IT WOULD DOUBLE THE DANGER OF IDENTIFICATION BUT WE CAN SOON FIND IF SHE'S GONE BACK TO HER HOME I TOLD TAYLOR WHO IS WATCHING IN BERKELEY SQUARE TO REPORT WHEN SHE RETURNED HE TOUCHED A BELL AND PUT A QUESTION TO THE MAN WHO ENTERED YES SIR WAS THE REPLY HE RANG UP HALF AN HOUR AGO
BY JOVE I LIKE THAT FELLOW'S COOLNESS SAID LORRY TO HARRY ANGUISH AFTER THE MEETING HE'S AFTER MY OWN HEART WHY HE TREATS US AS THOUGH WE WERE THE SUPPLIANTS HE THE ALMS GIVER HE IS PLAYING A GAME I'LL ADMIT BUT HE DOES IT WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT DELIGHTS ME
QUINNOX WAS SURVEYING THE VAGABONDS WITH A CRITICAL SUSPICIOUS EYE THEY ARE NOT ROBBERS OR THEY WOULD BE OFF LIKE RABBITS HE SAID REFLECTIVELY YOUR HIGHNESS THERE ARE MANY ROVING BANDS IN THE HILLS BUT I CONFESS THAT THESE MEN ARE UNLIKE ANY I HAVE HEARD ABOUT WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WILL RIDE DOWN AND QUESTION THEM
THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE SHE CRIED THEY MAY DROWN AT ANY MOMENT COME COME QUICKLY AND HELP ME SAVE THEM THE MAN LOOKED AT HER WITH A STRANGE FAR AWAY EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES
I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS THE CHAP I HAD DRIVEN DOWN BUT I COULD SEE IT WASN'T WHEN I GOT A CLOSER LOOK AT HIM HE WAS BETTER DRESSED AND HELD HIMSELF STRAIGHTER AH COULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM DID YOU NOTICE THE NUMBER OF THE CAR THE DRIVER SCRATCHED HIS HEAD A SORT OF ORDINARY LOOKING MAN SIR I DIDN'T TAKE MUCH STOCK OF HIM
TO SEND A CAR FROM LONDON TO KINGSTON RAILWAY STATION UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WOULD BE LESS RISKY HE WENT INTO THE TAILOR'S PLACE TO ARRANGE FOR A CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND SHE DISMISSED THE TAXI AS A MEASURE OF PRECAUTION IT WAS A PIECE OF LUCK THAT THE MAN NOTICED THE MOTOR CAR BUT WE CAN'T BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE NUMBER HE GAVE
EXCEPT POSSIBLY HORSE RACING IN MANY CASES IT IS PURELY AND SIMPLY LOVE OF THE GAME THAT ATTRACTS THERE IS NO ULTERIOR MOTIVE BUT IN THE CASE OF FREDDY AND MEN IN HIS LINE THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE OF COMBINING PLEASURE WITH PROFIT THE HINT WAS NOT LOST ON THE PICK POCKET
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO KINGSTON GREEN IT'S A HOT SCENT THERE YOU'VE GOT THE NUMBERS OF THE NOTES THAT MAXWELL GOT FROM THE BANK FIND OUT IF ANY OF THEM WERE CHANGED AT THE TAILOR'S THEY'VE TAKEN PRECAUTIONS TO BLIND THE TRAIL WHAT I THINK HAPPENED IS THAT SHE TELEPHONED FROM THE GENERAL POST OFFICE TO SOME MOTOR CAR FIRM
IN HIS OWN ROOM HE UNLOCKED THE BIG SAFE THAT STOOD BETWEEN THE TWO WINDOWS AND TAKING OUT THE ROLL HE HAD ABSTRACTED FROM LADY EILEEN'S DESK SURVEYED IT WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE PLAYING ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH ONCE HE HELD IT TO THE MIRROR AND THE WORD BURGHLEY WAS PLAINLY REFLECTED
BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK THE FOUR BOYS WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THE HARLOWE'S THEY CREPT QUIETLY UP TO THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW GRACE SAT BY THE FIRE READING VERY SOFTLY THEY BEGAN A POPULAR SONG THAT WAS A FAVORITE OF HERS GRACE'S QUICK EARS CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC
INDICATING THAT SHE WOULD GIVE IT TO HIM IF HE WOULD HELP HER THEN SHE SEIZED ONE END OF THE PLANK AND MADE A SIGN FOR HIM TO TAKE THE OTHER BUT THE STUBBORN CREATURE BEGAN TO UNLOAD THE CHIPS FROM THE WAGON GRACE RAN BLINDLY AHEAD DRAGGING THE PLANK ALONE HE'S FEEBLE MINDED SHE QUIVERED
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ICE HOUSE SHE CAME ABRUPTLY UPON A MAN ENGAGED IN LOADING A CHILD'S WAGON WITH CHIPS OF WOOD HELP CRIED GRACE HELP SOME PEOPLE HAVE BROKEN THROUGH THE ICE HAVE YOU A ROPE THE MAN MADE NO ANSWER WHATEVER HE DID NOT EVEN LOOK UP UNTIL GRACE SHOOK HIM BY THE SHOULDER
I SHOULD CALL HIM DUTCH FRED OH I WAS WANDERING SEND HIM IN THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE POPULAR CONCEPTION OF THE CRIMINAL ABOUT FREDDY AS HE SWAGGERED INTO THE ROOM BEARING A GLOSSY SILK HAT OF THE LATEST FASHIONABLE SHAPE ON ONE ARM HIS MORNING COAT WAS OF FAULTLESS CUT HIS TROUSERS WERE CREASED WITH PRECISION
WHERE RECENTLY SHE HAD SUNG HIS PRAISES TO YETIVE AND OTHERS SHE NOW WAS STRANGELY RETICENT
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I COULD HAVE SAVED IT SAID THE DETECTIVE REGRETFULLY AS IT IS IT'S OF NO USE AS EVIDENCE IN A COURT FOR IT ONLY RESTS ON MY WORD
WITH HIS HANDS THRUST DEEP IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS SIR HILARY STRODE TO AND FRO ACROSS THE ROOM IT'S TIME WE GOT A BIT FORWARD HE SAID
WHEN LORRY CAME DOWN TO SURRENDER HIMSELF IN ORDER TO SHIELD THE WOMAN HE LOVED AND QUINNOX HIMSELF PILOTED HIM THROUGH THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE CASTLE THEN CAME THE EXCITING SCENE IN WHICH LORRY PRESENTED HIMSELF AS A PRISONER
AND GET THE NUMBER VERIFIED IF YOU PHONE ME WHEN YOU GET DOWN THERE I'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW THINGS STAND GREEN HAD HIS HAND ON THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR BUT SUDDENLY SOMETHING OCCURRED TO HIM DO YOU THINK SHE'S GONE WITH HIM SIR HELDON FOYLE MADE A LITTLE GESTURE OF DISSENT
IT NEEDED BUT A GLANCE TO TELL HER WHO COMPRISED THE UNUSUAL COMPANY THE VERY RAGGEDNESS OF THEIR GARMENTS THE UNFORGETABLE DISREGARD FOR CONSEQUENCES THE IMPUDENT EASE WITH WHICH THEY FACED POVERTY AND WEALTH ALIKE BELONGED TO BUT ONE SET OF MEN THE VAGABONDS OF THE HAWK AND RAVEN
SHE EVEN ARGUED THE GUARD'S CASE BEFORE THE HEAD OF THE ARMY IMPRUDENTLY POINTING OUT MANY OF HIS SUPERIOR QUALITIES IN ADVOCATING HIS CAUSE THE COUNT WAS LEARNING FORBEARANCE IN HIS OLD AGE HE SAW THE WISDOM OF PROCRASTINATION BALDOS WAS IN FAVOR BUT SOMEDAY THERE WOULD COME A TIME FOR HIS UNDOING
CATCH HOLD OF THE TAIL PIECE TOM SHE CRIED FORTUNATELY THE ICE WAS VERY ROUGH WHERE THE GIRLS WERE STANDING OR THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SLIPPED AND FALLEN
I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP UP MUCH LONGER EXCLAIMED JULIA BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN KEEP ON CRYING REPLIED TOM EXASPERATED IT WILL WARM YOU AND REMEMBER THAT I AM DOING THE KEEPING UP I DON'T SEE THAT YOU ARE MAKING ANY SPECIAL EFFORT IN THAT DIRECTION
FRED TREVELYAN WHO IS HE HE ASKED MECHANICALLY HIS BRAIN STILL STRIVING WITH THE PROBLEM HE WISHED TO ELUCIDATE
THAT HE HAD BECOME IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO PROVE EMBARRASSING WHILE CONFESSING TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS A BIT TREACHEROUS AND WEAK SHE PROCEEDED TO IGNORE BALDOS WITH ASTONISHING PERSISTENCY APART FROM THE TEASING IT SEEMED TO HER OF LATE THAT HE WAS GROWING A SHADE TOO CONFIDENT
ON A DAY SOON AFTER THE RETURN OF LORRY AND ANGUISH FROM A TRIP TO THE FRONTIER BEVERLY EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO VISIT THE MONASTERY OF SAINT VALENTINE HIGH ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP IT WAS A LONG RIDE OVER THE CIRCUITOUS ROUTE BY WHICH THE STEEP INCLINE WAS AVOIDED
HE IS RIGHT ABOUT THAT DARNED OLD FORT SAID ANGUISH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH THINGS PROVES CONCLUSIVELY THAT HE IS NO ORDINARY PERSON YETIVE HAD A BIT OF A TALK WITH HIM JUST NOW SAID LORRY WITH A REFLECTIVE SMILE SHE ASKED HIM POINT BLANK IF HE KNEW WHO SHE WAS HE DID NOT HESITATE A SECOND
BALDOS REFUSED TO BE PROPERLY DEPRESSED BY HIS MISFORTUNE HE RETIRED TO THE OBLIVION SHE PROVIDED AND SEEMED DISAGREEABLY CONTENT APPARENTLY IT MADE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO HIM WHETHER HE WAS IN OR OUT OF FAVOR BEVERLY WAS IN HIGH DUDGEON AND LOW SPIRITS
GRACE ANXIOUSLY SCANNED THE EXPANSE OF THE ICE IT WAS NEARLY A MILE TO THE OTHER END OF THE POND AND THE LAST GROUP OF SKATERS HAD DISAPPEARED OVER THE BROW OF THE HILL
GRACE SOON SAW HOWEVER THAT THE IDEA WAS NOT ENTIRELY IDIOTIC LATER SHE WAS TO OFFER UP A PRAYER OF THANKS FOR THAT SAME CHILD'S WAGON THE DEAF AND DUMB MAN WAS WEARING HEAVY ARCTIC RUBBERS WHICH KEPT HIM FROM SLIPPING WHILE GRACE WHOSE SOLES WERE AS SMOOTH AS GLASS
GRACE'S MOTHER WAS JUSTLY HORRIFIED WHEN GRACE IN HER BEDRAGGLED CONDITION WALKED INTO THE LIVING ROOM SHE INSISTED ON PUTTING HER TO BED WRAPPING HER IN BLANKETS AND GIVING HER HOT DRINKS GRACE FELL INTO A SOUND SLEEP FROM WHICH SHE DID NOT AWAKEN UNTIL EVENING
THE CASHIER WAS CONFIDENT THAT HIS INITIALS IN BLUE PENCIL ON THE COUNTERFOIL WERE GENUINE YET HE WAS EQUALLY CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NOT RECEIVED THE MONEY THE TRADESMAN WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY THERE IT WAS I WAS AT A DEAD END ONE DAY I NOTICED A LITTLE STATIONER'S STORE NEAR THE TRADESMAN'S OFFICE
AND EVEN FROM DANGLOSS SHE WAS PROUD VASTLY PROUD OF HIM IN THESE DAYS THE IRON COUNT ALONE DISCREDITED THE ABILITY AND THE CONSCIENTIOUSNESS OF THE MOUNTEBANK AS HE NAMED THE MAN WHO HAD PUT HIS NOSE OUT OF JOINT BEVERLY SEEING MUCH OF MARLANX MADE THE MISTAKE OF CHIDING HIM FRANKLY AND GAILY ABOUT THIS AVERSION
SHALL I PUT HIM THROUGH A FEW MINUTES ELAPSED BEFORE FOYLE HEARD THE VOICE OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN OUTWITTED BY THE PRINCESS PETROVSKA IS THAT MISTER FOYLE THIS IS BLAKE SPEAKING WE'VE GOT ON THE TRACK OF THE LADY AGAIN SHE'D BEEN STAYING AT A BOARDING HOUSE PRETENDING SHE WAS A MEMBER OF A THEATRICAL COMPANY
WELL OFF I WENT TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL THAT THE BOY WAS ATTENDING AND HAD A TALK WITH ONE OF THE MASTERS
HURRIED AFTER HIM BUT SHE WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE AND COULD NOT RUN BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE BANK HE HAD ROUNDED THE CORNER OF THE ICE HOUSE AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT
MISS CALHOUN'S HORSE IN THE MEANTIME HAD CAUGHT THE FEVER HE PRANCED OFF TO THE ROADSIDE BEFORE SHE COULD GET HIM UNDER CONTROL SHE WAS THUS IN A POSITION TO OBSERVE THE TWO MEN ON THE GROUND SHIELDED FROM VIEW BY THE BODY OF THE HORSE THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO THE TRICK BALDOS HAD CLEVERLY WORKED
I WAS BEGINNING TO SEE MY WAY SO HAD THE BOY CALLED OUT OF HIS CLASS INTO A PRIVATE ROOM NOW TELL ME MY BOY I SAID WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE MONEY YOU STOLE FROM YOUR FATHER ON SUCH AND SUCH A DATE THE BLUFF WORKED HE TURNED PALE AND THEN ADMITTED THAT HE HAD FORGED THE INITIALS
SO THAT THE RIDER KEPT HIS SEAT ONLY BY MEANS OF ADEPT HORSEMANSHIP RAVONE LEAPED FORWARD AND AT THE RISK OF INJURY CLUTCHED THE PLUNGING STEED BY THE BIT TOGETHER THEY PARTIALLY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND BALDOS SWUNG TO THE GROUND AT RAVONE'S SIDE
REMEMBER YOUR PROMISE HE WHISPERED HOARSELY NO HARM MUST COME TO THEM
THE DEAF AND DUMB MAN WHO HELPED YOU OUT IS QUITE A CHARACTER SAID HIPPY I KNOW HIM WELL HE USED TO WORK FOR MY FATHER HE ISN'T HALF SO FOOLISH AS HE LOOKS EITHER
A BIG BROWN THING WITH AN OPEN BODY RIGHT YOU ARE WHITE SAID FOYLE WITH A NOD OF DISMISSAL THAT WILL DO FOR NOW YOU GO DOWN AND WAIT IN THE YARD WITH YOUR CAB AND WE'LL GET SOME ONE TO GO WITH YOU TO KINGSTON AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE TOLD US WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND THE MAN HIS EYES MET THOSE OF THE CHIEF DETECTIVE INSPECTOR
TOM AND JULIA WERE LIABLE TO BE SUCKED UNDER AND DROWNED WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING FOR HELP GRACE PUSHED RESOLUTELY ON IN THE MEANTIME HARDLY FOUR MINUTES HAD REALLY ELAPSED SINCE THE SKATERS HAD TUMBLED INTO THE WATER
WHEN GREEN HAD GONE FOYLE GAVE A FEW INSTRUCTIONS TO COVER THE POINTS THAT HAD ARISEN AND WALKED TO SIR HILARY THORNTON'S ROOM THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LOOKED UP AND PROFFERED A CIGAR THINK OF THE ANGELS HE SAID I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW THINGS WERE GOING
ALL RIGHT WHITE THERE'S NOTHING TO BE ALARMED ABOUT YOU PICKED UP A LADY OUTSIDE THE METROPOLITAN AND PROVINCIAL BANK THIS MORNING JUST SIT DOWN AND TELL US WHERE YOU TOOK HER
SOME DAY YOU MAY LEARN MORE ABOUT ME SHE SAID TO HIM I SINCERELY TRUST THAT I MAY MADAM SAID HE AND I'LL BET MY HAT HE WAS ENJOYING IT BETTER THAN EITHER OF US OF COURSE HE KNOWS YETIVE IS THE PRINCESS IT'S HIS INTENTION TO SERVE BEVERLY CALHOUN AND HE COULDN'T DO IT IF HE WERE TO CONFESS THAT HE KNOWS THE TRUTH
KEPT HER BALANCE ADMIRABLY BY MEANS OF THE OTHER END OF THE PLANK TOM AND JULIA CROSBY HAD NOW BEEN NEARLY TEN MINUTES IN THE WATER TWICE THE ICE HAD BROKEN UNDER TOM'S GRASP WHILE JULIA WHO SEEMED UNABLE TO HELP HERSELF HAD THROWN ALL HER WEIGHT ON THE POOR BOY
WE HAD BETTER GET HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OR WE'LL ALL BE LAID UP WITH COLDS THE THREE HALF FROZEN YOUNG PEOPLE MADE THEIR WAY HOME AS BEST THEY COULD THEIR CLOTHES HAD FROZEN STIFF MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HURRY
IN BROKEN JERKY SENTENCES RAVONE EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL THAT THEY WERE A PARTY OF ACTORS ON THEIR WAY TO EDELWEISS BUT THAT THEY HAD BEEN ADVISED TO GIVE THE PLACE A WIDE BERTH NOW THEY WERE MAKING THE BEST OF A HARD JOURNEY TO SERROS WHERE THEY EXPECTED BUT LITTLE BETTER SUCCESS
AND IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PARTY TO MAKE AN EARLY START YETIVE RODE WITH HARRY ANGUISH AND HIS WIFE THE COUNTESS WHILE BEVERLY'S COMPANION WAS THE GALLANT COLONEL QUINNOX BALDOS RELEGATED TO THE BACKGROUND BROUGHT UP THE REAR WITH HADDAN
ANYWAY I'LL SEND IT OUT TO THE COUNTY POLICE AND ASK THEM TO KEEP THEIR EYES OPEN
SUPPOSE THERE IS NO ONE THERE SHE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN RAN ON FASTER THAN BEFORE I SHALL FIND HELP OVER THERE I KNOW I SHALL SHE THOUGHT AS SHE HURRIED OVER THE FROZEN GROUND AND MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE ICE HOUSE THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST
AND ALSO SMASHED THREE BEFORE MY FATHER HAD THIS ONE MADE TO ORDER
SHE FOUND HERSELF SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY IN SNUG COMFORTABLE QUARTERS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS KINDNESS AND GOOD NATURED SIMPLE PEOPLE
THE LITTLE WOMAN THOUGHT THAT THE SECRET MIGHT KEEP AND INDEED BEING BY NO MEANS SO MUCH INTERESTED
I SAY MAC IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG IF I DROP I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO TO GO AND SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND SAY THAT I WAS VERY FOND OF HIM AND THAT
SAID THE MAN THERE'S A REGULAR SHINTY IN THE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING AT SIXES AND SEVENS THE LANDLORD'S COME IN AND TOOK POSSESSION THE SERVANTS WAS A DRINKIN UP IN THE DRAWINGROOM THEY SAID
AND WAS WAITING FOR HER HUSBAND IN THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM WITH FEMALE INSTINCT AUGURING EVIL THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM HAPPENED TO BE LEFT OPEN AND THE LADY OF COURSE WAS ISSUING FROM IT
PUNCTUALLY AS THE SHRILL TONED BELL OF THE BLACK MARBLE STUDY CLOCK BEGAN TO CHIME NINE SIR PITT MADE HIS APPEARANCE FRESH NEAT SMUGLY SHAVED
AS THEY KNELT DOWN TO PRAYERS WHICH SIR PITT READ TO THEM AND TO THE SERVANTS IN THEIR SUNDAY SUITS OR LIVERIES RANGED UPON CHAIRS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HISSING TEA URN
BUT ABOUT GOING HOME NEXT SATURDAY WHEN HIS FATHER WOULD CERTAINLY TIP HIM AND PERHAPS WOULD TAKE HIM TO THE PLAY HE'S A REGULAR TRUMP THAT BOY THE FATHER WENT ON STILL MUSING ABOUT HIS SON
THE MAN ADDED AFTER A PAUSE ONE OF THE SERVANTS IS OFF ALREADY
THINK OF HIS ONLY FINDING HER OUT NOW THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AND REMEMBERED A HUNDRED PARTICULAR CONVERSATIONS AT THE MESS TABLE IN WHICH MISSUS CRAWLEY'S REPUTATION
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL TAKE CHARGE OF HIM WHEN I'M GONE THAT DEAR GOOD WIFE OF YOURS HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO HIM AND HE'S FONDER OF HER THAN HE IS OF HIS DAMN IT LOOK HERE PITT
AS HE STRODE AWAY SO DID THE PEOPLE IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES WHO WERE OUT SO EARLY THE CHARITY BOYS WITH SHINING FACES THE GREENGROCER LOLLING AT HIS DOOR
IT WAS DAMNED UNFRIENDLY MAC SAID RAWDON QUITE OVERCOME AND COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS HE GAVE WAY TO AN EMOTION THE SIGHT OF WHICH CAUSED THE TOUGH OLD CAMPAIGNER
IN A WAY WHICH EVEN MADE THE BOY SMILE SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE THOUGHT MAJOR WILLIAM WAS THE BEST MAN IN ALL THE WORLD THE GENTLEST AND THE KINDEST THE BRAVEST AND THE HUMBLEST
TO MAKE ANY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETING WHICH HE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS HIS LORDSHIP'S INTENTION TO DEMAND AND WHICH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MORNING HAD RENDERED INEVITABLE
UNDER WHICH HIS COUNSELLOR HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN HIM LABOUR TOLD MACMURDO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STORY HIS ADVISER CAUGHT AT SOME STRAY HINTS IN IT
SHE WAS VERY DISTRAITE NERVOUS SILENT AND ILL TO PLEASE THE FAMILY HAD NEVER KNOWN HER SO PEEVISH SHE GREW PALE AND ILL
RAWDON SAT DOWN IN THE STUDY BEFORE THE BARONET'S TABLE
SHE PICKETED HER STEED HUNG UP HER WEAPONS AND WARMED HERSELF COMFORTABLY BY HIS FIRE THE HALT IN THAT ROVING RESTLESS LIFE WAS INEXPRESSIBLY SOOTHING AND PLEASANT TO HER
AND THERE'S ONLY A WAY OUT OF IT FOR ONE OF US MAC DO YOU UNDERSTAND I WAS PUT OUT OF THE WAY ARRESTED I FOUND EM ALONE TOGETHER
EVEN THE HUNDRED POUNDS THAT JANE TOOK YOU LAST NIGHT WERE PROMISED TO MY LAWYER TO MORROW MORNING AND THE WANT OF IT WILL PUT ME TO GREAT INCONVENIENCE
SHE TALKED TO HER PERPETUALLY ABOUT MAJOR DOBBIN SENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND MADE NO SCRUPLE OF DECLARING HER ADMIRATION FOR THAT EXCELLENT HIGH MINDED GENTLEMAN
THIS IS WHAT HE GAVE HER MAC AND SHE KEP IT UNKNOWN TO ME AND WITH THIS MONEY IN THE HOUSE SHE REFUSED TO STAND BY ME WHEN I WAS LOCKED UP
CAME TO DINE WITH JOS AND THEN CAME EVERY DAY TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO BECKY POOR EMMY WHO WAS NEVER VERY TALKATIVE AND MORE GLUM AND SILENT THAN EVER AFTER DOBBIN'S DEPARTURE WAS QUITE FORGOTTEN
WATCHED OVER THEM WHEN NOBODY CARED FOR THEM HOW ALL HIS COMRADES ADMIRED HIM THOUGH HE NEVER SPOKE OF HIS OWN GALLANT ACTIONS HOW GEORGY'S FATHER TRUSTED HIM BEYOND ALL OTHER MEN
SHE BROUGHT EVERYBODY TO THE HOUSE AND SHE MADE JOS BELIEVE THAT IT WAS HIS OWN GREAT SOCIAL TALENTS AND WIT
WHICH CONTAINS BIRTHS MARRIAGES AND DEATHS WHATEVER BECKY'S PRIVATE PLAN MIGHT BE BY WHICH DOBBIN'S TRUE LOVE WAS TO BE CROWNED WITH SUCCESS
SHE SAID SHE WAS ILL IN BED AND PUT ME OFF TO ANOTHER DAY AND WHEN I GOT HOME I FOUND HER IN DIAMONDS AND SITTING WITH THAT VILLAIN ALONE
AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP NEVER CEASED FROM THAT DAY UNTIL THE LAST WHEN YOUR DEAR FATHER FELL DID DOBBIN KILL THE MAN WHO KILLED PAPA
INVITED BY THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE TO MEET HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
SHE HAD A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS PERTAINING TO HERSELF TO CONSIDER AND WHICH CONCERNED HER A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN MAJOR DOBBIN'S HAPPINESS IN THIS LIFE
SHE WOULD BREAK OFF IN THE MIDST OF THE SONG
AND SAY THAT COLONEL CRAWLEY WOULD BE ALL DAY AFTER ONE O'CLOCK AT THE REGENT CLUB IN SAINT JAMES'S STREET NOT AT HOME THE FAT RED FACED MAN LOOKED AFTER HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
THANK YOU BROTHER SAID HE I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOUR WORD I WILL UPON MY HONOUR THE BARONET SAID AND THUS AND ALMOST MUTELY
HAD HE BEEN LOOKING OUT TROOPS OF SCHOOLS WERE ON THEIR MARCH TO CHURCH
I ALWAYS SAID SHE'D THROW YOU OVER HE BEGAN INDEED THERE WERE BETS IN THE REGIMENT AND AT THE CLUBS REGARDING THE PROBABLE FATE OF COLONEL CRAWLEY
OF AMELIA HE DROVE OUT WITH BECKY IN HIS OPEN CARRIAGE HE ASKED LITTLE PARTIES AND INVENTED FESTIVITIES TO DO HER HONOUR TAPEWORM
DURING WHICH REBECCA WAS LEFT TO THE SOCIETY OF MISTER JOSEPH
PITT STOOPED AND PICKED THEM UP AMAZED AT SO MUCH WEALTH NOT THAT RAWDON SAID I HOPE TO PUT A BULLET INTO THE MAN WHOM THAT BELONGS TO
AND EVERY KIND OF PERSON IN A WORD WAS RESTING HIMSELF AFTER THE NIGHT'S LABOURS AND NOT BEING ON DUTY WAS IN BED HIS ROOM WAS HUNG ROUND WITH BOXING SPORTING AND DANCING PICTURES
SPEEDILY MADE HIS WAY UP TO THE ROOM OF HIS OLD FRIEND AND COMRADE CAPTAIN MACMURDO WHO CRAWLEY FOUND TO HIS SATISFACTION WAS IN BARRACKS CAPTAIN MACMURDO
AND HER NIECE AS THEY WERE TAKING EARLY TEA AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST IN THE FORMER LADY'S APARTMENT AND WONDERED HOW THE RAWDING CRAWLEYS COULD GIT ON THE VALET HAD DAMPED AND FOLDED THE PAPER ONCE MORE
AS FOR EMMY WHO FOUND HERSELF NOT IN THE LEAST MISTRESS OF HER OWN HOUSE EXCEPT WHEN THE BILLS WERE TO BE PAID BECKY SOON DISCOVERED THE WAY TO SOOTHE AND PLEASE HER
AND INDEED BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION ROUND TO THE DOBBIN SUBJECT A SCORE OF TIMES EVERY DAY MEANS WERE EASILY FOUND TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF GEORGY AND THE SERVANTS AMELIA'S MAID
TOO HOW TO LOVE AND TO SING CERTAIN SONGS I SAY TO WHICH THE MAJOR WAS PARTIAL
SHE WAS RECONCILED TO MISSUS CRAWLEY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAUSE THE LATTER BECAME WILLIAM'S MOST ARDENT ADMIRER AND CHAMPION AND IN THOSE NIGHTLY CONCLAVES IN WHICH THE TWO LADIES INDULGED AFTER THEIR PARTIES
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED PITT I'M NOT DRUNK SHUT THE DOOR I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU PITT CLOSED THE DOOR AND CAME UP TO THE TABLE WHERE HE SAT DOWN IN THE OTHER ARM CHAIR
EVERY MORNING SHE AND THEY PERFORMED THIS DUTY PRIVATELY AND BEFORE THE PUBLIC CEREMONIAL AT WHICH SIR PITT PRESIDED AND AT WHICH ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSEHOLD WERE EXPECTED TO ASSEMBLE
A MODEL OF NEATNESS AND EVERY PROPRIETY HE STARTED WHEN HE SAW POOR RAWDON IN HIS STUDY IN TUMBLED CLOTHES WITH BLOOD SHOT EYES AND HIS HAIR OVER HIS FACE
THAT ONE PLACED FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE STEWARD AGENT OR CONFIDENTIAL VISITOR WHO CAME TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH THE BARONET AND TRIMMED HIS NAILS MORE VEHEMENTLY THAN EVER PITT
HAD BEEN TORN TO SHREDS THERE'S NO WAY BUT ONE OUT OF IT
THE MAN AS WAS VERY NOISY AND DRUNK INDEED SAYS NOTHING SHALL GO OUT OF THE HOUSE UNTIL HIS WAGES IS PAID UP THE ACCOUNT OF THIS LITTLE REVOLUTION IN MAY FAIR ASTONISHED
AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT ASHAMED OF HAVING TAKEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN'S MONEY AND HERE'S SOME MORE I'VE ONLY KEPT BACK A FEW POUNDS WHICH BECKY MAY AS WELL HAVE
AS THE TWO BROTHERS PASSED OUT OF THE STUDY SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO RAWDON AND SAID SHE WAS GLAD HE WAS COME TO BREAKFAST THOUGH SHE COULD PERCEIVE BY HIS HAGGARD UNSHORN FACE
HE HAD READ IN THE JOURNAL A FLAMING ACCOUNT OF FESTIVITIES AT GAUNT HOUSE
SHE MAY BE INNOCENT AFTER ALL HE SAID SHE SAYS SO
BUT HIS HANDS SHOOK AND HE WAS SO AGITATED THAT THE POCKET BOOK FELL FROM HIM AND OUT OF IT THE THOUSAND POUND NOTE WHICH HAD BEEN THE LAST OF THE UNLUCKY BECKY'S WINNINGS
DYED MOUSTACHE WHEN RAWDON TOLD THE CAPTAIN HE WANTED A FRIEND THE LATTER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL ON WHAT DUTY OF FRIENDSHIP HE WAS CALLED TO ACT AND INDEED HAD CONDUCTED SCORES OF AFFAIRS
OTHERWISE HE WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF SUNDAY PAPERS INTO HIS HOUSEHOLD THE THEATRICAL CRITICISMS THE FIGHT FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS A SIDE BETWEEN THE BARKING BUTCHER
IN HER MORNING GOWN WAS UP AND ABOVE STAIRS IN THE NURSERY SUPERINTENDING THE TOILETTES OF HER CHILDREN AND LISTENING TO THE MORNING PRAYERS WHICH THE LITTLE CREATURES PERFORMED AT HER KNEE
AND SAY HIS PRAYERS IN THE MOSQUES
WHO ARE TO MAKE THE PERMANENT APPOINTMENTS AND NOT TO THE RECESS OF THE NATIONAL SENATE WHO ARE TO HAVE NO CONCERN IN THOSE APPOINTMENTS AND WOULD HAVE EXTENDED THE DURATION IN OFFICE OF THE TEMPORARY SENATORS TO THE NEXT SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE
CHOSEN BY THE LEGISLATURE THEREOF FOR SIX YEARS AND THE LATTER DIRECTS THAT IF VACANCIES IN THAT BODY SHOULD HAPPEN BY RESIGNATION OR OTHERWISE DURING THE RECESS OF THE LEGISLATURE OF ANY STATE
OF COURSE IT CANNOT EXTEND TO THE APPOINTMENTS OF SENATORS WHOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONSTITUTION
AND AN ABHORRENCE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF THIS BE THE POINT ON WHICH THE OBJECTION TURNS IT DESERVES TO BE EXAMINED IS IT SUPPORTED BY REASON THIS CANNOT BE SAID WITHOUT MAINTAINING THAT FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND CITIZENS
THE ELECTION OF A REPRESENTATIVE IS LEFT TO ABOUT AS MANY HUNDREDS
IN WHOSE REPRESENTATION THE VACANCIES HAD HAPPENED INSTEAD OF MAKING IT TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE ENSUING SESSION OF THE NATIONAL SENATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BODY AUTHORIZED TO MAKE THE PERMANENT APPOINTMENTS
THAT THE PRETENDED POWER OF THE PRESIDENT TO FILL VACANCIES IN THE SENATE HAS BEEN DEDUCED A SLIGHT ATTENTION TO THE CONNECTION OF THE CLAUSES AND TO THE OBVIOUS MEANING OF THE TERMS WILL SATISFY US THAT THE DEDUCTION IS NOT EVEN COLORABLE
WHICH HAVE BEEN SO INSIDIOUSLY
THE IMAGES OF ASIATIC DESPOTISM AND VOLUPTUOUSNESS HAVE SCARCELY BEEN WANTING TO CROWN THE EXAGGERATED SCENE WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO TREMBLE AT THE TERRIFIC VISAGES OF MURDERING JANIZARIES
SUCH WILL BE THE RELATION BETWEEN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS DUTY GRATITUDE INTEREST AMBITION ITSELF ARE THE CHORDS BY WHICH THEY WILL BE BOUND TO FIDELITY AND SYMPATHY WITH THE GREAT MASS OF THE PEOPLE
THE THIRD CHARGE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS THAT IT WILL BE TAKEN FROM THAT CLASS OF CITIZENS WHICH WILL HAVE LEAST SYMPATHY WITH THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE AND BE MOST LIKELY TO AIM AT AN AMBITIOUS SACRIFICE OF THE MANY
HAS IT APPEARED ON TRIAL THAT THE SENATORS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW YORK OR THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF PENNSYLVANIA OR THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY
WHATEVER HOPES OR PROJECTS MIGHT BE ENTERTAINED BY A FEW ASPIRING CHARACTERS IT MUST GENERALLY HAPPEN THAT A GREAT PROPORTION OF THE MEN DERIVING THEIR ADVANCEMENT FROM THEIR INFLUENCE WITH THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE MORE TO HOPE FROM A PRESERVATION OF THE FAVOR
THEY WILL BE COMPELLED TO ANTICIPATE THE MOMENT WHEN THEIR POWER IS TO CEASE WHEN THEIR EXERCISE OF IT IS TO BE REVIEWED AND WHEN THEY MUST DESCEND TO THE LEVEL FROM WHICH THEY WERE RAISED THERE FOREVER TO REMAIN UNLESS A FAITHFUL DISCHARGE OF THEIR TRUST
WE SHALL FIND IT INVOLVING EVERY SECURITY WHICH CAN BE DEVISED OR DESIRED FOR THEIR FIDELITY TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE
ARE ALMOST AS LARGE AS HER DISTRICTS WILL BE BY WHICH HER FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE ELECTED THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA IS SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY THOUSAND SOULS IT WILL THEREFORE FORM NEARLY TWO DISTRICTS FOR THE CHOICE OF FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES
THERE IS IN EVERY BREAST A SENSIBILITY TO MARKS OF HONOR OF FAVOR OF ESTEEM AND OF CONFIDENCE WHICH APART FROM ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF INTEREST IS SOME PLEDGE FOR GRATEFUL AND BENEVOLENT RETURNS
BUT AS THE FULL GROWN PROGENY OF THAT DETESTED PARENT
NOR WOULD IT IN FACT BE LESS ERRONEOUS AS TO THE LAST THE ONLY DIFFERENCE DISCOVERABLE BETWEEN THE TWO CASES IS THAT EACH REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE ELECTED BY FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND CITIZENS WHILST IN THE INDIVIDUAL STATES
MUST HAVE ORIGINATED IN AN INTENTION TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE TOO PALPABLE TO BE OBSCURED BY SOPHISTRY TOO ATROCIOUS TO BE PALLIATED BY HYPOCRISY I HAVE TAKEN THE PAINS TO SELECT THIS INSTANCE OF MISREPRESENTATION
THE GENIUS OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM THE NATURE OF JUST AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS AND ABOVE ALL THE VIGILANT AND MANLY SPIRIT WHICH ACTUATES THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA A SPIRIT WHICH NOURISHES FREEDOM AND IN RETURN IS NOURISHED BY IT
WHAT ARE WE TO SAY TO THE MEN WHO PROFESS THE MOST FLAMING ZEAL FOR REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT YET BOLDLY IMPEACH THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF IT WHO PRETEND TO BE CHAMPIONS FOR THE RIGHT AND THE CAPACITY OF THE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN RULERS
AND WHO ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WILL NOT REQUIRE A FUTURE ESTABLISHMENT BY LAW THIS POSITION WILL HARDLY BE CONTESTED THE LAST OF THESE TWO CLAUSES IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR
INGRATITUDE IS A COMMON TOPIC OF DECLAMATION AGAINST HUMAN NATURE AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT INSTANCES OF IT ARE BUT TOO FREQUENT AND FLAGRANT BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN PRIVATE LIFE
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN DEEMED ONE OF THE STRONGEST BONDS BY WHICH HUMAN POLICY CAN CONNECT THE RULERS AND THE PEOPLE TOGETHER IT CREATES BETWEEN THEM THAT COMMUNION OF INTERESTS AND SYMPATHY OF SENTIMENTS OF WHICH FEW GOVERNMENTS HAVE FURNISHED EXAMPLES
IN SO FLAGRANT A CASE TO ALLOW MYSELF A SEVERITY OF ANIMADVERSION LITTLE CONGENIAL WITH THE GENERAL SPIRIT OF THESE PAPERS I HESITATE NOT TO SUBMIT IT TO THE DECISION OF ANY CANDID AND HONEST ADVERSARY
JUSTIFY OR EXTENUATE THE SHAMEFUL OUTRAGE HE HAS OFFERED TO THE DICTATES OF TRUTH AND TO THE RULES OF FAIR DEALING THE SECOND CLAUSE OF THE SECOND SECTION OF THE SECOND ARTICLE
SO THE CHOICE WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO BE DIVERTED FROM HIM
WOULD OF COURSE HAVE GOVERNED THE MODIFICATION OF A POWER WHICH RELATED TO THE TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS AND AS THE NATIONAL SENATE IS THE BODY WHOSE SITUATION IS ALONE CONTEMPLATED IN THE CLAUSE UPON WHICH THE SUGGESTION UNDER EXAMINATION HAS BEEN FOUNDED
BUT WITHOUT WHICH EVERY GOVERNMENT DEGENERATES INTO TYRANNY IF IT BE ASKED WHAT IS TO RESTRAIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM MAKING LEGAL DISCRIMINATIONS IN FAVOR OF THEMSELVES AND A PARTICULAR CLASS OF THE SOCIETY I ANSWER
WHICH HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO GIVE SUCCESS TO THE ATTEMPTED IMPOSITION IN ONE INSTANCE WHICH I CITE AS A SAMPLE OF THE GENERAL SPIRIT THE TEMERITY HAS PROCEEDED SO FAR AS TO ASCRIBE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
CAN ONLY BE DEEMED TO RESPECT THOSE OFFICERS IN WHOSE APPOINTMENT THAT BODY HAS A CONCURRENT AGENCY WITH THE PRESIDENT BUT LAST THE FIRST AND SECOND CLAUSES OF THE THIRD SECTION OF THE FIRST ARTICLE
AND THE IMPERIAL PURPLE FLOWING IN HIS TRAIN HE HAS BEEN SEATED ON A THRONE SURROUNDED WITH MINIONS AND MISTRESSES GIVING AUDIENCE TO THE ENVOYS OF FOREIGN POTENTATES IN ALL THE SUPERCILIOUS POMP OF MAJESTY
IF THIS CLAUSE IS TO BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE ONE WHICH PRECEDES THE VACANCIES OF WHICH IT SPEAKS MUST BE CONSTRUED TO RELATE TO THE OFFICERS DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING ONE AND THIS WE HAVE SEEN EXCLUDES FROM ITS DESCRIPTION
WHICH HAVE BEEN CONTRIVED TO PERVERT THE PUBLIC OPINION IN RELATION TO THE SUBJECT THEY SO FAR EXCEED THE USUAL THOUGH UNJUSTIFIABLE LICENSES OF PARTY ARTIFICE
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT OF THE PROPOSED GOVERNMENT CLAIMS NEXT OUR ATTENTION THERE IS HARDLY ANY PART OF THE SYSTEM WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN ATTENDED WITH GREATER DIFFICULTY IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF IT THAN THIS
RESTRAINING THEM FROM OPPRESSIVE MEASURES THAT THEY CAN MAKE NO LAW WHICH WILL NOT HAVE ITS FULL OPERATION ON THEMSELVES AND THEIR FRIENDS
HE COULD SUPPOSE NOTHING LESS THAN THAT SOME UNREASONABLE QUALIFICATION OF PROPERTY WAS ANNEXED TO THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE OR THAT THE RIGHT OF ELIGIBILITY WAS LIMITED TO PERSONS OF PARTICULAR FAMILIES OR FORTUNES
IS THE CONSEQUENCE FROM THIS DOCTRINE ADMISSIBLE IF WE SAY THAT FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED CITIZENS ARE AS MANY AS CAN JOINTLY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE MUST WE NOT DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE OF THE IMMEDIATE CHOICE OF THEIR PUBLIC SERVANTS
AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPROPER TO OBLIGE THIS BODY TO BE CONTINUALLY IN SESSION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF OFFICERS AND AS VACANCIES MIGHT HAPPEN IN THEIR RECESS WHICH IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE TO FILL WITHOUT DELAY
OF MORE THAN TWENTY POUNDS STERLING ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT RATE OF MONEY NOTWITHSTANDING THESE UNFAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOTWITHSTANDING SOME VERY UNEQUAL LAWS IN THE BRITISH CODE
AND TO BLUSH AT THE UNVEILED MYSTERIES OF A FUTURE SERAGLIO ATTEMPTS SO EXTRAVAGANT AS THESE TO DISFIGURE OR IT MIGHT RATHER BE SAID TO METAMORPHOSE THE OBJECT RENDER IT NECESSARY
THAT EVEN IN A DISPOSITION THE MOST CANDID AND TOLERANT THEY MUST FORCE THE SENTIMENTS WHICH FAVOR AN INDULGENT CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONDUCT OF POLITICAL ADVERSARIES TO GIVE PLACE TO A VOLUNTARY
TUESDAY FEBRUARY NINETEENTH
TO THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF THE FEW OF ALL THE OBJECTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN FRAMED AGAINST THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WHILST THE OBJECTION ITSELF IS LEVELLED AGAINST A PRETENDED OLIGARCHY
AND TO PLACE IT IN A CLEAR AND STRONG LIGHT AS AN UNEQUIVOCAL PROOF OF THE UNWARRANTABLE ARTS WHICH ARE PRACTICED TO PREVENT A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JUDGMENT OF THE REAL MERITS OF THE CONSTITUTION SUBMITTED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN MAGNIFIED INTO MORE THAN ROYAL PREROGATIVES HE HAS BEEN DECORATED WITH ATTRIBUTES SUPERIOR IN DIGNITY AND SPLENDOR TO THOSE OF A KING OF GREAT BRITAIN HE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO US WITH THE DIADEM SPARKLING ON HIS BROW
OF HALF THAT ANNUAL VALUE TO THIS QUALIFICATION ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES IS ADDED ANOTHER ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY ELECTORS WHICH RESTRAINS THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE TO PERSONS HAVING A FREEHOLD ESTATE OF THE ANNUAL VALUE
ARE LESS CAPABLE OF CHOOSING A FIT REPRESENTATIVE OR MORE LIABLE TO BE CORRUPTED BY AN UNFIT ONE THAN FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED REASON ON THE CONTRARY ASSURES US THAT AS IN SO GREAT A NUMBER A FIT REPRESENTATIVE WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO BE FOUND
THAT THE REAL REPRESENTATION IN THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS VERY LITTLE EXCEEDS THE PROPORTION OF ONE FOR EVERY THIRTY THOUSAND INHABITANTS BESIDES A VARIETY OF POWERFUL CAUSES NOT EXISTING HERE AND WHICH FAVOR IN THAT COUNTRY
IS THE CHARACTERISTIC POLICY OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT THE MEANS RELIED ON IN THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOR PREVENTING THEIR DEGENERACY ARE NUMEROUS AND VARIOUS THE MOST EFFECTUAL ONE
THE FIRST OF THESE TWO CLAUSES IT IS CLEAR ONLY PROVIDES A MODE FOR APPOINTING SUCH OFFICERS WHOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONSTITUTION AND WHICH SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW
SO IS THE GOVERNOR OF THAT STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND OF THIS STATE AND THE PRESIDENT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE I LEAVE EVERY MAN TO DECIDE WHETHER THE RESULT OF ANY ONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS CAN BE SAID TO COUNTENANCE A SUSPICION
IN THE SECOND PLACE THEY WILL ENTER INTO THE PUBLIC SERVICE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CANNOT FAIL TO PRODUCE A TEMPORARY AFFECTION AT LEAST TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS
THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE THIRD THE TIME WITHIN WHICH THE POWER IS TO OPERATE DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE AND THE DURATION OF THE APPOINTMENTS TO THE END OF THE NEXT SESSION OF THAT BODY
ARE STRENGTHENED BY MOTIVES OF A MORE SELFISH NATURE HIS PRIDE AND VANITY ATTACH HIM TO A FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH FAVORS HIS PRETENSIONS AND GIVES HIM A SHARE IN ITS HONORS AND DISTINCTIONS
THIS BOLD EXPERIMENT UPON THE DISCERNMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN HAS BEEN HAZARDED BY A WRITER WHO WHATEVER MAY BE HIS REAL MERIT HAS HAD NO INCONSIDERABLE SHARE IN THE APPLAUSES OF HIS PARTY
I WILL ADD
IT WAS A LESSON LEARNED LONG BEFORE BY OTHER COMPANIES IN OTHER STUDIOS I HAD SEEN MUSIC EMPLOYED IN THE MAKING OF SOBERLY DRAMATIC SCENES SOLELY AS AN AID TO THE ACTORS ENABLING THEM TO GET INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF THEIR WORK MORE QUICKLY
EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR THE CLIMAX SHIRLEY HAD BEEN PLAYING A SORT OF JEKYLL AND HYDE ROLE IN WHICH HE WAS AT ONCE THE YOUNG LAWYER FRIEND OF ENID AND THE BLACK TERROR
IN THE BRIGHT GLARE HER FEATURES TOOK ON A ROUND INNOCENCE AND SHE WAS AS SUCCESSFUL IN PORTRAYING SWEETNESS AS MARILYN WAS IN THE SIMULATION OF THE MOCKING EVIL OF THE VAMPIRE
DOING IT OVER AND OVER WITHOUT THE CAMERAS UNTIL EVERY DETAIL REACHED A PRACTICED PERFECTION IN THIS I WAS CERTAIN HE ACHIEVED RESULTS SUPERIOR TO WERNER'S SLAP DASH AND BANG THEN CAME THE CALL FOR ACTION
KENNEDY FOUND THE LITTLE VIAL AND EXAMINED IT ATROPIN HE EJACULATED WALTER HE TURNED TO ME GET SOME PHYSOSTIGMIN QUICK HAVE MACKAY DRIVE YOU IT'S IT'S LIFE OR DEATH HERE I'LL WRITE IT DOWN PHYSOSTIGMIN
IT WAS REAL EVEN BEFORE I HAD GRASPED THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HAPPENING KENNEDY HAD DASHED FORWARD THE CAMERAS STILL WERE GRINDING AND THEY CAUGHT HIM AS HE KNEELED AT THE SIDE OF THE STRICKEN MAN HARDLY A SECOND AFTERWARD MACKAY AND I FOLLOWED
NO CURE AT ALL I WAS UNABLE TO GET ANY MORE OUT OF KENNEDY HOWEVER MANTON I DETECTED IN THE BACKGROUND WITH PHELPS THE TWO MEN WERE ARGUING AS ALWAYS AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BANKER WAS ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING
HE WENT ON INTO THE SET BUT HIS LEGS SEEMED TO WABBLE BENEATH HIM I WAS SURE IT WAS MORE THAN THE WEAKNESS RESULTING FROM HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE FIRE KAUF'S VOICE THROUGH THE MEGAPHONE ECHOED SUDDENLY FROM WALL TO WALL REVERBERATING BENEATH THE ROOF
AS WELL AS TO POINT SUSPICION TOWARD THE LEADING MAN IN THE MIDST OF MY REVERIE SHIRLEY APPROACHED AND PASSED US HE WAS IN THE GARB OF MEPHISTO LIKE THE OTHERS HE HAD NOT YET MASKED HIS FACE
THE VIVACITY SHE ASSUMED SEEMED UNNATURAL
AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SKIDDED AROUND CURVES AND LITERALLY HURDLED OBSTACLES I REMEMBERED A FORGOTTEN FACT ATROPIN THAT WAS BELLADONNA SIMPLY ANOTHER NAME FOR THE DRUG
WERNER IN THE PHOTOGRAPHING OF ANOTHER HE HAD PREFERRED SUICIDE AND HAD SELECTED THE MOST SPECTACULAR MOMENT POSSIBLE FOR HIS LAST UPON EARTH YES SHIRLEY WAS GUILTY RATHER THAN WAIT
WHERE WERNER AND MANTON HAD DISPENSED WITH MUSIC IN A DESPERATE EFFORT AT ECONOMY KAUF HAD REALIZED THAT MONEY SAVED IN THAT WAY WAS LOST THROUGH TIME WASTED WITH DISPIRITED PEOPLE
AND IN A MOMENT PITCHED FORWARD UPON THE FLOOR SPUTTERING AND CLUTCHING AT THE EMPTY AIR ANOTHER CRY BROKE FROM BETWEEN HIS LIPS A GHASTLY CONTRACTED SHRIEK AS TREBLE AS THOUGH FROM THE THROAT OF A WOMAN THIS WAS NO PART OF THE STORY NO SKILLFUL BIT OF ACTING
AND WERE AT KENNEDY'S SIDE KAUF AND THE OTHERS THEIR FACES WEIRDLY ASHEN CLUSTERED ABOUT IN FRIGHT A THIRD TIME THE INVISIBLE HAND HAD STRUCK AT A MEMBER OF THE COMPANY THE BLACK TERROR
AS SOON AS THIS SCENE IS OVER WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE PROJECTION ROOM EVERYONE CONCERNED IN THE DEATH OF MISS LAMAR AND OF MISTER WERNER THE SCENARIO WRITER LOOKED UP QUICKLY DO YOU
AT THE START OF THIS EPISODE THE ORCHESTRA WAS PLAYING AND THE DANCERS WERE IN MOTION SUDDENLY GORDON AS THE HERO STRODE UP TO SHIRLEY AND UNMASKED HIM WITH A FEW BITTER WORDS WHICH LATER WOULD BE FLASHED UPON THE SCREEN IN A SPOKEN TITLE
BY THIS CONSTANT HANGING ABOUT THE STUDIO WHERE PREVIOUSLY MY SYMPATHY HAD BEEN WITH PHELPS ENTIRELY NOW I REALIZED THAT THE PROMOTER HAD WON ME INDEED MANTON'S INTEREST IN ALL THE AFFAIRS OF PICTURE MAKING AT THIS PLANT
I ATTRACTED KENNEDY'S ATTENTION YOU DON'T WANT MILLARD TO GET AWAY I WHISPERED KENNEDY SENT MACKAY TO STOP HIM THE AUTHOR ACCOMPANIED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILLINGLY YES MISTER KENNEDY
SHIRLEY HAD LEFT THE STUDIO FLOOR APPARENTLY TO GO TO HIS DRESSING ROOM NOW I NOTICED THAT HE RETURNED AND PASSED CLOSE JUST IN TIME TO HEAR MILLARD'S QUESTION AND KENNEDY'S ANSWER HIS EYES DILATED
AND NATURALLY UNDER THE LIGHTS THE ENTIRE SET SPARKLED WITH A TAWDRY GARISHNESS APT TO FOOL THOSE UNINITIATED INTO THE SECRETS OF PHOTOGRAPHY ON THE SCREEN
I REPEATED THE CONVERSATION AS NEAR AS I COULD RECONSTRUCT IT
A SCENE OF GAYETY CONFRONTED US IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE GLOOMY ATMOSPHERE OF THE REST OF THE ESTABLISHMENT KAUF HOWEVER HAD THOROUGHLY DEMONSTRATED HIS GENIUS AS A DIRECTOR
AS SOON AS ALL COULD BE ASSEMBLED IN THE PROJECTION ROOM THE HEAVY MAN HAD NOT CARED TO FACE JUSTICE IN SO PROSAIC A MANNER WITH THE SAME SENSE OF THE MELODRAMATIC WHICH HAD LED HIM TO SLAY STELLA LAMAR IN THE TAKING OF A SCENE
AND DRANK THE CONTENTS EVIDENTLY HE KNEW HIS MANSFIELD WELL SLOWLY HE BEGAN TO ACT OUT THE CHANGE IN HIS APPEARANCE WHICH CORRESPONDED WITH THE ASSUMPTION OF CONTROL BY THE EVIL WITHIN
HAD BEEN FAR TOO SINCERE AND EARNEST TO PERMIT THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS SEEKING TO WRECK THE COMPANY OR TO DOUBLE CROSS HIS BACKER MILLARD ENTERED THE STUDIO AS I GLANCED ABOUT FOR HIM HE HANDED SOME SHEETS TO KAUF THEN TURNED TO LEAVE
WOULD SEEM AS HEAVY AND SUBSTANTIAL AS THE WALLS AND BEAMS OF THE FINEST OLD MANSION EVEN THE INFERIOR MATERIALS IN THE GOWNS OF MOST OF THE GIRLS WOULD PHOTOGRAPH AS WELL AS THE MOST EXPENSIVE SILK IN FACT
HE ASKED SOBERLY NOT EXACTLY BUT I WILL IDENTIFY THE GUILTY PERSON
HE MAY LOSE MORE THAN THAT MUTTERED MACKAY AND I WONDERED JUST WHOM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUSPECTED IS EVERYONE HERE I ASKED ALL SEVEN GORDON AND SHIRLEY OF THE MEN
I HEARD A WOMAN'S SCREAM MARILYN DID SHE THINK HIM DEAD ONCE IN THE CAR HEADED FOR THE NEAREST DRUG STORE GRASPING WILDLY AT THE SIDE OR AT THE BACK OF THE SEAT EVERY FEW MOMENTS
WHOM SHE KNEW TO BE HER LOVER MARILYN WAS EVERYWHERE MAKING MISCHIEF THE BEST SHE COULD SHIRLEY STALKED ABOUT IN HIS SATANIC RED WHICH WOULD PHOTOGRAPH BLACK AND APPEAR EVEN MORE SOMBER ON THE SCREEN
TO THE BEING WHO WAS A VERY INCARNATION OF EVIL FOR ONCE KAUF DID NOT REHEARSE THE SCENE SHIRLEY WAS OBVIOUSLY WEAKENED FROM HIS EXPERIENCE AND THE DIRECTOR WISHED TO SPARE HIM
A PECULIAR BRIGHTNESS IN HIS EYES STRUCK ME AND I NUDGED KENNEDY BELLADONNA KENNEDY EXPLAINED WHEN HE WAS BEYOND EARSHOT OH I REMEMBERED ENID TOLD HIM TO USE IT WHAT
OF COURSE THE WHOLE WAS NOT PHOTOGRAPHED IN A CONTINUOUS STRIP FROM ONE CAMERA POSITION I SAW THAT KAUF MADE SEVERAL LONG SHOTS TO CATCH THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE THEN HE MADE CLOSE UP SCENES OF ALL THE PRINCIPALS
SO THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PEOPLE NOT TO GET INTO THE SWING AND THE RESULT WAS A RIOTOUS SWIRLING OF GRACEFULLY DANCING PAIRS THE GIRLS SELECTED FOR THEIR BEAUTY FLASHING HALF REVEALED FACES TOWARD THE CAMERA
AND OF SOME OF THE BEST APPEARING EXTRAS AT ONE TIME HE ORDERED A PANORAMA EFFECT IN WHICH THE CAMERAS PAMMED SWEPT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER GIVING A SUCCESSION OF FACES AT CLOSE RANGE FINALLY
ALL READY EVERYONE IN THE SET MASKS ON TAKE YOUR PLACES AT A SIGNAL THE ORCHESTRA STRUCK UP AND THE COUPLES STARTED TO DANCE IT WAS A WONDERFULLY COLORFUL SCENE AND I SAW THAT KAUF PROPOSED TO REHEARSE IT THOROUGHLY
CARRYING THE BAG WITH ITS INDISPUTABLE PROOF OF SOME PERSON'S GUILT WE MADE OUR WAY THROUGH THE FAMILIAR CORRIDOR BY THE DRESSING ROOMS OUT UNDER THE ROOF OF THE SO CALLED LARGE STUDIO THERE
OF A FAINT YELLOW WHICH WOULD PHOTOGRAPH DAZZLING WHITE REVEALING TRIM STOCKINGED ANKLES AND SLENDER BARE ARMS FRAMING FACE AND EYES DANCING WITH MERRIMENT AND MALICIOUSNESS
UNMASKED AND CORNERED AT THIS FUNCTION OF A SOCIETY TERRIFIED BY THE DREAD UNKNOWN MENACE HE WAS TO MAKE THE TRANSFORMATION DIRECTLY BEFORE THE EYES OF EVERYONE USING THE MYTHICAL DRUG WHICH CHANGED HIM FROM A YOUNG MAN OF GOOD APPEARANCE AND FAMILY
UNQUESTIONABLY SHE WAS THE PRETTIEST GIRL BENEATH THE ARCS NEVER TO BE SUSPECTED AS THE WOMAN WHO HAD BRAVED THE TERRORS OF A FILM FIRE TO RESCUE THE MAN SHE LOVED ENID WAS STATELY AND SERENE IN THE GOWN OF MARIE ANTOINETTE
TO LOSE ACTUAL INCHES I THOUGHT IT A WONDERFUL EXHIBITION THE VERY NEXT INSTANT THERE CAME A GROAN FROM SHIRLEY SOMETHING WHICH AT ONCE INDICATED PAIN AND REALIZATION AND FEAR HE LOST ALL CONTROL OF HIMSELF
INSTANTLY A CROWD GATHERED ABOUT BUT IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO OBSTRUCT THE CAMERA VIEW CORNERED SEEING THAT FLIGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THE SLOW PROCESSES OF LEGAL JUSTICE HE HAD ATTEMPTED SUICIDE NOW WE RACED TO SAVE HIS LIFE TO PRESERVE IT FOR A MORE FITTING END
AND MC GROARTY'S INFORMATION THAT HE HAD BEEN HANGING ABOUT THAT PART OF THE STUDIO FOR SOME TIME PREVIOUSLY SOME ONE HAD PLANTED A CIGARETTE CASE AND STUB TO IMPLICATE GORDON ACCORDING TO KENNEDY'S THEORY
SHIRLEY INTERESTED ME THE MOST HOWEVER I WONDERED IF KENNEDY STILL ELIMINATED HIM IN GUESSING AT THE IDENTITY OF THE CRIMINAL I CALLED TO MIND THE HEAVY MAN'S PRESENCE IN THE BASEMENT AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION
TO COUNTERACT THE DEPRESSION CAUSED BY ALL THE RECENT MELODRAMATIC AND TRAGIC HAPPENINGS HE HAD BROUGHT IN AN EIGHT PIECE ORCHESTRA ESTABLISHING THE MEN IN THE SET ITSELF SO AS TO GET FULL PHOTOGRAPHIC VALUE FROM THEIR JAZZ ANTICS
AND MARILYN AND ENID OF COURSE WERE OUT ON THE FLOOR OF THE SUPPOSED BALLROOM GORDON I RECOGNIZED BECAUSE I REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS TO WEAR THE GARB OF A MONK MARILYN WAS EASILY PICKED OUT ALTHOUGH
HE ASKS US TO WAIT UNTIL HE GETS THIS ONE BIG SCENE IT'S THE CLIMAX OF THE PICTURE REALLY THE UNMASKING OF THE BLACK TERROR
CAMERA KAUF BEGAN TO BOB UP AND DOWN INTO IT EVERYBODY FOR FASCINATION AND CHARM THIS FAR EXCEEDED THE BANQUET SCENE WHICH WE HAD WITNESSED IN THE TAKING PREVIOUSLY THE MUSIC WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD
ALL THE DETAILS WERE SHOUTED OUT THROUGH THE MEGAPHONE HOWEVER AND I GRASPED THAT THE ACTION OF THIS PART OF THE DANCE WAS FAMILIAR TO EVERYONE IT WAS THE BIG SCENE OF THE STORY TOWARD WHICH ALL OTHER EVENTS HAD BUILT
BY LONG EXPERIENCE MANY OF THE EXTRA GIRLS HAD LEARNED TO COUNTERFEIT THE LATEST FASHIONS AT A COST RIDICULOUS BY COMPARISON KENNEDY APPROACHED KAUF THEN RETURNED TO US
WITH ALL THE HORROR WRITTEN INTO THAT STORY CONTAINED NOTHING AS FEARFUL AS THE MENACE TO THE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN ITS PRODUCTION SHIRLEY'S SKIN WAS COLD AND CLAMMY HIS FACE ALMOST RIGID WHILE CONSCIOUS HE WAS HELPLESS
SHIRLEY HAD PROCURED THE STUFF FOR USE IN HIS EYES NEVERTHELESS HE HAD BEEN AWARE UNDOUBTEDLY OF ITS DEADLY NATURE PASSING BY KENNEDY AND THE REST OF US HE HAD OVERHEARD KENNEDY STATE THAT THE MURDERER WOULD BE IDENTIFIED
IT SHOULD BE BUT A TURN A MAN'S JOYS ARE NOT BOUNDED BY HIS LOVES OR EVEN BY THE SATISFACTION OF A PERFECTLY UNTRAMMELLED MIND
BUT WATCH AND PURSE WERE IN HIS CHAMBER WHILE THOUGH THE COLONEL'S ROOM WAS FULL OF COSTLY OBJECTS THEY WERE NOT OF THE PORTABLE NATURE THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THEM VALUABLE TO THE MEN
BUT ALWAYS TO FIND THAT THE DOOR WAS STRENGTHENED IN ALL DIRECTIONS WITH METAL PLATES AND AT LAST THE TASK WAS GIVEN UP LOOK HERE GROWLED THE LEADER OF THE PARTY THAT BED ISN'T USED
WHISPERED THE SHIVERING EX SERVANT FAINT FROM HIS WOUND
KNOW THAT THIS IS A STRANGE AND ARDUOUS BURDEN TO LAY UPON MY HEIR IN CHIEF
WHOM THE CAMPERS SURMISED CORRECTLY TO BE OLGA GRAHAM
AND AS HE LAY BACK WITH THE MAN ON HIS CHEST HALF STUNNED HELPLESS AND DESPAIRING HE SAW INDISTINCTLY THE FIGURE AGAINST THE WINDOW HEARD THE SASH SLIDE DOWN AND THE DARKNESS WAS COMPLETE
OSWALD THE TONE WAS CONTROLLING AND YET THAT OF ONE STRONG MAN TO ANOTHER IS IT FOR US TO READ THE HEART OF ANY WOMAN LEAST OF ALL OF A WOMAN OF HER SUSCEPTIBILITIES AND KEEN INNER LIFE
OF THE TESTATOR'S IMMENSE WEALTH AND GLANCED AT KATRINE I SHALL NOT GET ALL HE THOUGHT
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE GRAHAM GIRLS MUST RESULT IN A BETRAYAL OF THEIR UTTER LACK OF SYMPATHY WITH THIS SOCIAL INDISPENSABILITY OF SUCH HELPLESS SOCIETY VICTIMS
KEEP THAT LIGHT STILL WILL YOU HE CRIED MENACINGLY WHY
TO HIM I LEAVE THE REST THIS DONE
IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT ASSOCIATE WITH THE FAMILY THAT HAD CUSTODY OF THE LITTLE BOY IN WHOSE INTERESTS THEY WERE WORKING ANY ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART THEY FELT TO DISCUSS SOCIETY
AND LIVE CLOSE TO NATURE YOU KNOW
TELL ME IF I'M TO HATE YOU THROUGH LIFE YEA THROUGH ALL ETERNITY OR IF I MUST SEEK IN SOME UNIMAGINABLE FAILURE OF MY OWN CHARACTER OR CONDUCT THE CAUSE OF HER INTOLERABLE DESPAIR
NOTHING AT ALL SAID THE TALL MAN QUIETLY BUT THERE THAT'LL DO FIRST OF ALL YOU WERE SO PRECIOUS ANXIOUS TO GO NOW YOU KNOW WE CAN'T GET DOWN YOU'RE ALL FOR THE JOB I SAY
JUST ABOUT WHERE SHE SAID THE STONE THAT WAS THROWN AT HER FELL
WOULD BE GLAD TO ASSIST YOU IN ANY WAY HE CAN I'M GOING TO SEND HIM DOWN HERE IF YOU SAY THE WORD TO HELP YOU EXTEND THAT ROPE AROUND YOUR SWIMMING PLACE HE'S A VERY HANDY BOY
YOU KNOW DID ANYBODY EVER SEE IT ASKED HAZEL EDWARDS NOT THAT I KNOW
SUDDENLY THIS STRANGE BEING APPEARED NEAR THE EDGE OF THE TIMBER
THAT CENTERED ALL INTEREST IN UNAFFECTED EARNEST UPON THE LATEST DEPREDATION OF THEIR ENEMY OR ENEMIES WITH A STICK SHE FISHED OUT ONE END OF A SMALL ROPE
THE TREMBLING MAN TOOK THE LANTERN WHILE HIS LEADER WENT DOWN ON ONE KNEE
THE LITTLE MAN TOOK A BUNCH FROM THE BAG BUT
IT MUST BE SOMEBODY ESCAPED FROM A LUNATIC ASYLUM I SAW SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS MOVING THROUGH THE WOODS NEAR OUR COTTAGE ONE NIGHT ADDIE GRAHAM INTERPOSED AT THIS POINT
AND PROCEEDED DELIBERATELY TO WIPE THEM THE SERVANTS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE GLOOM WHERE THEY SAT TO GIVE EACH OTHER A CONGRATULATORY SHAKE OF THE HAND I NOW COME TO THE IMPORTANT BEQUESTS SAID MISTER GIRTLE
THEN AFTER WHAT SEEMED AN AGE OF SUSPENSE THE OLD SOLICITOR WENT ON THE SUM OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS FREE OF DUTY TO BUY MOURNING THERE WAS A DEATH LIKE STILLNESS AS THE LAWYER PAUSED
MARION STANLOCK INQUIRED WE LOOKED AROUND SPECIALLY TO FIND OUT IF THERE WERE ANY OTHERS NEAR BUT DIDN'T FIND ANY
THAT'S IT IS IT QUIET WILL YOU HE STOOD LISTENING ATTENTIVELY IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE ISN'T A SOUND LET'S GO THEN AT ONCE WHAT EMPTY
THIS BROUGHT FORTH A TORRENT OF WHISPERED OATHS FROM BOTH MEN HERE LET ME HAVE A TRY WHISPERED THE LITTLE MAN I CAN OPEN IT IF YOU'LL HOLD THIS BLESSED GLIM STILL I NEVER SEE SUCH A CUR THEN
NOTHING BUT THE STERN LANGUAGE SUITABLE TO THE STERN FACT HE WISHED TO IMPART WOULD LEAVE HIS LIPS AND ENDED THE PITIFUL STRUGGLE OF THE MOMENT WITH ONE QUICK UNPREMEDITATED BLOW WAS WHAT HE SAID
PERFORMANCE MAKES A WORLD OF ITS OWN FOR THE CAPABLE AND THE STRONG AND THIS WAS STILL LEFT TO HIM
CAN'T YOU GET THE DOOR OPEN THEN SAID THE THIRD MAN AFTER THE OTHER HAD SHAKEN HIS HEAD WHY DON'T YOU SEE WE CAN'T BUT WE SHALL GET NOTHING FOR OUR TROUBLE
DRIVING THE THIRD BACK
LAWRENCE MY GRAND NIECE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS FREE OF DUTY THE SAME TO BE INVESTED IN CONSOLS AND IF SHE MARRIES TO BE SECURED BY MARRIAGE SETTLEMENTS TO HERSELF AND CHILDREN
HE THREW A HEAVY STONE INTO OUR BONFIRE AND KNOCKED THE SPARKS AND EMBERS IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT HE KEPT HIMSELF HIDDEN A LITTLE LATER WE HEARD A HIDEOUS CALL IN THE TIMBERS
SET THEMSELVES IN LINES
I LEAVE MY FREEHOLD HOUSE AND FURNITURE LIBRARY PLATE PICTURES STATUES BRONZES AND CURIOS
AND ITS SHARP EDGE INSERTED BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE POST BUT THE GREAT SOLID MAHOGANY DOOR STOOD FIRM ONLY EMITTING NOW AND THEN A LOUD CRACK SHARP AS THAT GIVEN BY A CART WHIP
I SHOULD BUT INSULT YOUR GRIEF BY ANY LENGTHY EXPRESSIONS OF REGRET AND SORROW A GROAN OF INTOLERABLE ANGUISH FROM THE SICK MAN'S LIPS AND THEN THE QUICK THRUST
THE CLOTHES LINE THEY HAD USED TO INDICATE THE SAFETY LIMITS OF THEIR BATHING PLACE
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO THE GRAHAM GIRLS CALL THEY'RE EARLY RISERS WE MUST SAY THAT MUCH FOR THEM OBSERVED KATHERINE IN A LOW VOICE WE MUST GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR NOT LYING IN BED UNTIL TEN O'CLOCK
AT THIS SUGGESTION OF THE GUARDIAN THE GIRLS TURNED THEIR ATTENTION AGAIN TO THE CONDITIONS ABOUT THEIR BATHING BEACH A MOMENT LATER KATHERINE MADE A DISCOVERY
AND NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD EVER ATTAIN THE DELIGHTS EACH WAS SO FITTED TO ENJOY WHY SHOULDN'T HE LAUGH WHAT IS LEFT TO MAN BUT MOCKERY WHEN ALL PROPS FALL DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THE UNIVERSAL LOT
THAT'S STRANGE COMMENTED THE OLDER OF THE VISITORS MAYBE IT'S THE GHOST SUGGESTED OLGA WITH A FAINT SMILE GHOST REPEATED SEVERAL OF THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS IN UNISON
AND SELL AND INVEST THE RUSSIAN LEATHER CASE CONTAINING BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES AMOUNTING TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS ARTIS DREW A LONG BREATH THROUGH HIS TEETH
HIS FEET BECAME ENTANGLED IN THE CURTAIN AND HE FELL HEAVILY WITH HIS ADVERSARY UPON HIM QUICK MORRIS WHISPERED A VOICE NO NO CURSE YOU SHUT THE WINDOW THERE'S ONLY ONE
AND NOT WITHOUT EMITTING A LOUD NOISE THE WORK OF CUTTING BEGAN THE SAWDUST FALLING LIGHTLY ON THE LION'S SKIN BUT AT THE END OF A FEW SECONDS A DULL HARSH SOUND
ORLANDO UPON LEAVING HIS BROTHER'S ROOM DID NOT STOP TO DELIVER THAT BROTHER'S MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO DORIS HE LEFT THIS FOR TRUDA TO DO AND RETIRED IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HANGAR IN THE WOODS
THE DOORWAY SHALL THEN BE BUILT UP WITH BLOCKS OF STONE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF WHICH I HAD THE ROOM BUILT A SUFFICIENCY OF WHICH ARE STORED UP IN CELLAR NUMBER FOUR SEALED WITH MY SEAL
GO ON SAID THE VOICE OF THE LESSER MAN AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A BRIGHT FLASH OF LIGHT A SHARP REPORT
AND IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER FOR YOU TO LET HIM DO THE WORK THAN TO PERFORM SUCH A LABORIOUS TASK YOURSELVES THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH
THE BLADE FELL HEAVILY UPON THE LANTERN AND DASHED IT TO THE FLOOR
SON OF MY COUSIN WILLIAM ARTIS READ ON MISTER GIRTLE
WHERE'S YOUR MATCHES QUICK LIGHT THE GLIM AH WOULD YOU LIE STILL AND BITE THAT YOU JUST MOVE AGAIN AND I'LL PULL THE TRIGGER THE BARREL OF A REVOLVER HAD BEEN THRUST BETWEEN CAPEL'S TEETH
LOCKING HIMSELF IN HE SLIGHTLY RAISED THE ROOF AND THEN SAT DOWN BEFORE THE CAR WHICH WAS RAPIDLY TAKING ON SHAPE AND ASSUMING
HE ABRUPTLY EXCLAIMED SPEAK I AM BOUND TO LISTEN YOU ARE MY BROTHER ORLANDO TURNED TOWARDS DORIS SHE WAS SLIPPING AWAY
WHICH WAS ALL SWEETNESS NOW SHE CONTINUED HER SOCIAL DISCOURSE THUS
TURNED AND RAN AWAY MY SISTER TOLD US ABOUT THAT NEXT MORNING AND WE ALL LAUGHED AT HER SAID OLGA CONTINUING THE ACCOUNT I TOLD HER TO GO OUT AND FIND THE STONE
SOMEHOW TILL WE'VE DONE HERE
YOU SAW MISS CHALLONER IN LENOX ADMIRED HER OFFERED YOURSELF TO HER AND AFTERWARDS WROTE HER A THREATENING LETTER BECAUSE SHE REJECTED YOU IT IS TRUE
THOUGH ONLY JUST BEGUN WOULD LAST HIS LIFETIME NOTHING COULD STOP THEM NOW NOTHING NOTHING AND HE LAUGHED AS THE THOUGHT WENT HOME LAUGHED AT THE IRONY OF FATE
THEN DEATH FOLLOWS THE IMPULSE WHICH GIVEN AN INSTANT OF THOUGHT WOULD HAVE VANISHED IN A BACK SWEEP OF OTHER EMOTIONS CHANCE WAS THE REAL ACCESSORY TO THIS DEATH BY SUICIDE OSWALD
WHICH WAS IN THE CUSTOMARY FORM AND BEGAN WITH A SERIES OF BEQUESTS
TO KATRINE LEVEILLEE D'ENGHIEN
AND THE SILENCE GREW HEAVY IT WAS BROKEN WHEN IT WAS BROKEN BY A CRY FROM OSWALD
OF THE SAID FREEHOLD AS ABOVE NAMED
THEN THERE WAS THE FAINT STREAK OF LIGHT AS A MATCH WAS STRUCK THE BULL'S EYE LANTERN WAS PICKED UP AND RE LIT AND THE BRIGHT RAYS ONCE MORE PLAYED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM
ORLANDO I BELIEVE IN GOD THEN SEEK YOUR COMFORT THERE I FIND IT IN HARNESSING THE WINDS IN FORCING THE POWERS OF NATURE TO DO MY BIDDING
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO A BLANK ADVENTURE THE LIGHT PLAYED ON THE BLADE OF THE KEEN EDGED SWORD AS IF IT WERE PHOSPHORESCENT BUT THE LAMBENT QUIVERING WAS NOT SEEN BY THE HOLDER OF THE LANTERN
NOBODY ELSE IN THE FAMILY WOULD BELIEVE ME WHEN I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT IT LOOKED LIKE A MAN IN A LONG WHITE ROBE AND LONG HAIR AND A LONG WHITE BEARD IT WAS MOONLIGHT AND I WAS LOOKING OUT OF MY BEDROOM WINDOW
QUIET AND PEACEABLE IN HIS WAYS AND INOFFENSIVE ENOUGH BUT A RARE HAND AT GOSSIPING ABOUT THE BEACH AND THE WALLS YOU MIGHT FIND HIM AT ALL ODD HOURS EITHER IN THESE PUBLIC PLACES OR IN THE DOOR OF HIS SHOP
AS FAST AS HE HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS ADVANCED IN YEARS AND IN POWER OF APPRECIATING STUDIES MORE AND MORE ELEVATED THE RESULT WAS THAT WHEN AT LENGTH HE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
HE CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE TAUGHT TO DRUM NOT MERELY AS MOST BOYS DO JUST TO MAKE A NOISE FOR HIS AMUSEMENT BUT REGULARLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY SO AS TO ENABLE HIM TO UNDERSTAND AND EXECUTE ALL THE BEATS AND SIGNALS USED IN CAMP
GENERAL MENESIUS RESIDED IN THE PALACE WITH HIS CHARGE
AND STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR MY WEIGHT THE PEOPLE HAVING RECEIVED NOTICE A SECOND TIME I WENT AGAIN THROUGH THE CITY TO THE PALACE WITH MY TWO STOOLS IN MY HANDS WHEN I CAME TO THE SIDE OF THE OUTER COURT I STOOD UPON ONE STOOL
WITH THEIR CHIEF ATTENDANTS ABOUT THEM HER IMPERIAL MAJESTY WAS PLEASED TO SMILE VERY GRACIOUSLY UPON ME AND GAVE ME OUT OF THE WINDOW HER HAND TO KISS BUT I SHALL NOT ANTICIPATE THE READER WITH FURTHER DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS KIND
HE KNEW THAT AMONG THE POPULATIONS OF THAT IMMENSE COUNTRY THERE WERE A GREAT MANY WILD AND TURBULENT TRIBES HALF SAVAGE IN HABITS AND CHARACTER THAT WOULD NEVER BE CONTROLLED BUT BY MILITARY FORCE AND THAT THE COUNTRY TOO
TO SEE SOME LIKENESS TO THE DEAD MAN BUT THERE WAS NO LIKENESS TO BE SEEN FOR WHEREAS GILVERTHWAITE WAS A BIG AND STALWART FELLOW THIS WAS A SMALL AND SPARE WOMAN
MOST URGENT COUNSELS TO PERSEVERE AS HE HAD BEGUN IN THE FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTY TO RESIST EVERY TEMPTATION TO IDLENESS OR EXCESS AND TO DEVOTE HIMSELF WHILE YOUNG WITH PATIENCE
LAWS LEARNING AND RELIGION THEIR PLANTS AND ANIMALS THEIR PECULIAR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS WITH OTHER MATTERS VERY CURIOUS AND USEFUL MY CHIEF DESIGN AT PRESENT BEING ONLY TO RELATE SUCH EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS AS HAPPENED TO THE PUBLIC
THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE TWO BRANCHES OF THE FAMILY BECAME MORE DECIDED THAN EVER AND WHEN SOPHIA OBTAINED HER RELEASE FROM THE CONVENT AND MANAGED TO GET THE CONTROL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
AND I WAS HELPING HIM TO BUILD HUTCHES FOR THE BEASTS IN HIS FATHER'S BACK YARD AND WE WERE WANTING SOME BITS OF STUFF IRON AND WIRE AND THE LIKE AND KNOWING I WOULD PICK IT UP FOR A FEW PENCE AT CRONE'S SHOP I WENT ROUND THERE ALONE
AND ALONG WITH ALL THESE
IF HE KNEW IN DETAIL PRECISELY HOW EVERY THING OUGHT TO BE DONE AND THAT WAS THE REASON WHY HE TOOK SO MUCH PAINS TO LEARN HIMSELF HOW TO DO THEM AS HE GREW OLDER HE CONTRIVED TO INTRODUCE HIGHER AND HIGHER BRANCHES OF MILITARY ART INTO THE SCHOOL
ONE MORNING ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTER I HAD OBTAINED MY LIBERTY RELDRESAL PRINCIPAL SECRETARY AS THEY STYLE HIM FOR PRIVATE AFFAIRS CAME TO MY HOUSE ATTENDED ONLY BY ONE SERVANT
LITTLE VEINS BRING IT DOWN FROM THE ICE ABOVE INTO THE GREAT CAVERNS OF THE MOUNTAIN'S HEART WHENCE THE ARTERIES LET IT OUT AGAIN GUSHING IN PIPES AND CLEFTS AND DUCTS OF ALL SHAPES AND KINDS THROUGH AND THROUGH ITS BULK
RUNNING CEASELESSLY COLD AND BABBLING THROUGH BANKS CRUSTED WITH CARBUNCLES AND GOLDEN TOPAZES OR OVER A GRAVEL OF WHICH SOME OF THE STONES ARC RUBIES AND EMERALDS PERHAPS DIAMONDS AND SAPPHIRES WHO CAN TELL
IN OLD TIMES WITHOUT KNOWING SO MUCH OF THEIR STRANGENESS AND AWFULNESS AS WE DO PEOPLE WERE YET MORE AFRAID OF MOUNTAINS BUT THEN SOMEHOW THEY HAD NOT COME TO SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE AS WELL AS AWFUL AND THEY HATED THEM
PETER AND HIS WIFE HOWEVER WERE TROUBLED WITH THE FANCY THAT THEY HAD STOOD IN THE WAY OF THEIR BOY'S GOOD FORTUNE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A FINE THING FOR HIM AND THEM TOO THEY THOUGHT IF HE HAD RIDDEN WITH THE GOOD KING'S TRAIN
WAS SURROUNDED BY OTHER NATIONS THAT WOULD SOMETIMES UNLESS HE WAS WELL PREPARED FOR THEM ASSUME A HOSTILE ATTITUDE AGAINST HIS GOVERNMENT AND PERHAPS MAKE GREAT AGGRESSIONS UPON HIS TERRITORIES
UPON THE MOUNTAIN ON ONE OF ITS MANY CLAWS STOOD A GRAND OLD HOUSE HALF FARMHOUSE HALF CASTLE BELONGING TO THE KING AND THERE HIS ONLY CHILD
AND HE WANTED THE SILVER NOT TO BUY RICH THINGS FOR HIMSELF BUT TO HELP HIM TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY AND PAY THE ONES THAT DEFENDED IT FROM CERTAIN TROUBLESOME NEIGHBOURS AND THE JUDGES WHOM HE SET TO PORTION OUT RIGHTEOUSNESS AMONG THE PEOPLE
BEFORE I KNEW HOW IT CAME ABOUT CRONE WAS DEEP INTO THE MURDER BUSINESS THEY'LL NOT HAVE FOUND MUCH OUT BY THIS TIME YON POLICE FELLOWS NO DOUBT MISTER MONEYLAWS HE SAID
THAT HE WAS CERTAINLY IN LIVERPOOL
WHAT'S WANTED IN AN AFFAIR LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GENIUSES YOU READ ABOUT IN THE STORYBOOKS THE MEN THAT CAN TRACE A MURDER FROM THE WAY A MAN TURNS OUT HIS TOES
MAYBE YOUR MOTHER HUGH CAN FIND MISSUS HANSON A LODGING I ANSWERED THAT MY MOTHER WOULD NO DOUBT DO WHAT SHE COULD TO LOOK AFTER MISSUS HANSON AND PRESENTLY THE WOMAN WENT AWAY WITH MAISIE LEAVING HER PAPERS WITH MISTER LINDSEY
LIKE THE RICH EMBROIDERY OF THE GARMENT BELOW
AND TAKE THE POWER INTO HIS OWN HANDS
YOUR NAME WOULD BE GILVERTHWAITE THEN BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED TO BE SURE SIR SAME AS JAMES'S SHE REPLIED HIM AND ME WAS THE ONLY TWO THERE WAS I'VE BROUGHT PAPERS WITH ME THAT'LL PROVE WHAT I SAY
AND THERE THEY STAND IN THE COOL COLD SKY MOUNTAINS THINK OF THE CHANGE AND YOU WILL NO MORE WONDER THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING AWFUL ABOUT THE VERY LOOK OF A MOUNTAIN FROM THE DARKNESS
AND I'VE NEVER SET EYES ON HIM FROM THAT DAY TO THIS BUT I SHOULD KNOW HIM NOW HE WAS BURIED YESTERDAY REMARKED MISTER LINDSEY IT'S A PITY YOU DIDN'T TELEGRAPH TO SOME OF US
HEAVED UP IN BILLOWS TWISTED IN WATERSPOUTS DASHED TO MIST UPON ROCKS BEATEN BY MILLIONS OF TAILS AND BREATHED BY MILLIONS OF GILLS WHENCE AT LAST MELTED INTO VAPOUR BY THE SUN
AND THE TREES GROWING OUT OF ITS SIDES LIKE HAIR TO CLOTHE IT AND THE LOVELY GRASS IN THE VALLEYS AND THE GRACIOUS FLOWERS
AND TO IMPROVE AND PERFECT THE ORGANIZATION OF IT IN EVERY WAY AFTER A WHILE HE ADOPTED IMPROVED UNIFORMS AND EQUIPMENTS FOR THE PUPILS
THE WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD AS IF THIS QUESTION PRESENTED DIFFICULTIES
CHAPTER ONE THE MOUNTAIN CURDIE WAS THE SON OF PETER THE MINER HE LIVED WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER IN A COTTAGE BUILT ON A MOUNTAIN AND HE WORKED WITH HIS FATHER INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN A MOUNTAIN IS A STRANGE AND AWFUL THING
BECAUSE I RESERVE THEM FOR A GREATER WORK WHICH IS NOW ALMOST READY FOR THE PRESS CONTAINING A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THIS EMPIRE FROM ITS FIRST ERECTION THROUGH ALONG SERIES OF PRINCES WITH A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THEIR WARS AND POLITICS
THE GARRET WINDOWS AND TOPS OF HOUSES WERE SO CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS THAT I THOUGHT IN ALL MY TRAVELS I HAD NOT SEEN A MORE POPULOUS PLACE
OR TO WHEEL EARTH AND CONSTRUCT FORTIFICATIONS WITH HIS OWN HANDS STILL LESS TO MAKE THE WHEELBARROWS BY WHICH THE WORK WAS TO BE DONE BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT HE COULD SUPERINTEND THESE THINGS FAR MORE INTELLIGENTLY AND SUCCESSFULLY
THAT THE ROAD TO THE NEXT DUTY IS THE ONLY STRAIGHT ONE OR THAT FOR THEIR FANCIED GOOD WE SHOULD NEVER WISH OUR CHILDREN OR FRIENDS TO DO WHAT WE WOULD NOT DO OURSELVES IF WE WERE IN THEIR POSITION
WHOSE RUSTY BLACK CLOTHES MADE HER LOOK THINNER AND MORE MEAGRE THAN SHE REALLY WAS ALL THE SAME
AND TO HAVE ANOTHER ARRANGEMENT MADE FOR THE BOY BY WHICH SHE THOUGHT HER ENDS WOULD BE ATTAINED SO MENESIUS BADE HIS YOUNG CHARGE FAREWELL NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT GIVING HIM IN PARTING
AND ALLOW HIM TO DO AS HE PLEASED HER PLAN WAS ALSO TO SUPPLY HIM WITH MEANS OF PLEASURE AND INDULGENCE VERY FREELY THINKING THAT A BOY OF HIS AGE WOULD NOT HAVE THE GOOD SENSE OR THE RESOLUTION TO RESIST THESE TEMPTATIONS
THERE WAS A MAN A NEIGHBOUR OF OURS CAME HOME FROM CENTRAL AMERICA MAYBE FIVE YEARS AGO AND HE TOLD US HE'D SEEN OUR JAMES OUT THERE AND THAT HE WAS WORKING AS A SUB CONTRACTOR OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT ON THAT PANAMA CANAL THERE WAS SO MUCH TALK ABOUT IN THEM DAYS
HE WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD THINGS AS THEY WERE EXCEPT FOR THE PRINCESS'S SAKE BUT WHOEVER IS DILIGENT WILL SOON BE CHEERFUL AND THOUGH THE MINERS MISSED THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE CASTLE THEY YET MANAGED TO GET ON WITHOUT THEM
AYE HE SAID PANAMA NOW HE WAS THERE AND THAT'S THE LAST YOU EVER HEARD THAT'S THE VERY LAST WE EVER HEARD SIR SHE ANSWERED TILL OF COURSE WE SAW THESE PIECES IN THE PAPERS THIS LAST DAY OR TWO
AND TOOK THE OTHER IN MY HAND THIS I LIFTED OVER THE ROOF AND GENTLY SET IT DOWN ON THE SPACE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND COURT WHICH WAS EIGHT FEET WIDE I THEN STEPT OVER THE BUILDING VERY CONVENIENTLY FROM ONE STOOL TO THE OTHER
