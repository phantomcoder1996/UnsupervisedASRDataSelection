AND THAT I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED HIS FATHER SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOOK AFTER THE ESTATE AND PRACTISE ECONOMIES BECAUSE I WISHED HIM TO DEVOTE HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO POLITICS IF WE HAD CHILDREN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM ALL PROSPEROUS AND WITH GOOD STATE APPOINTMENTS
I INSIST TOO ON HIS STUDYING A GREAT DEAL BEFORE LONG I HOPE TO SEE HIM A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF MY FAMILY AND HIS MOTHER'S I HAVE TOLD HIM PLAINLY THAT I AM AMBITIOUS
WHEN I AM WITH YOU LOVE SO TRANSPORTS ME THAT I AM POWERLESS TO EXPRESS THE DEPTH OF MY AFFECTION I CAN BUT WORSHIP AND ADMIRE ONLY AT A DISTANCE DOES THE POWER OF SPEECH RETURN
WHY SHOULD WE NOT BOTH BE LAUGHING AND GAY IN YOUR PARIS WHENCE I SHALL CARRY YOU OFF NOW AND AGAIN TO MY BEAUTIFUL OASIS IN PROVENCE OH LOUISE DON'T SPOIL THE SPLENDID FUTURE WHICH AWAITS US BOTH DON'T DO THE MAD THINGS WITH WHICH YOU THREATEN ME
WE SHALL TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN THE SILKWORMS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT OUR MULBERRY LEAVES WILL BE SOLD WE SHALL KNOW THE STRANGE VICISSITUDES OF LIFE IN PROVENCE AND THE STORMS THAT MAY ATTACK EVEN A PEACEFUL HOUSEHOLD
PERHAPS SOME DAY THE COUNTRY DAME MAY GO AND SPEND A WINTER IN MARSEILLES BUT DANGER DOES NOT HAUNT THE PURLIEUS OF A NARROW PROVINCIAL STAGE THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO FEAR NOT EVEN AN ADMIRATION SUCH AS COULD ONLY MAKE A WOMAN PROUD
AND INVEST HER WITH AN EXHAUSTLESS POWER A REDUNDANCY OF LIFE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING BLOSSOM AROUND HER THE MORE SHE IS MISTRESS OF HERSELF THE MORE CERTAINLY WILL THE LOVE AND HAPPINESS SHE CREATES BE FIT TO WEATHER THE STORMS OF LIFE
I SHALL TAKE A LEADING PART IN THE PUBLIC LIFE OF THE DISTRICT AND ON YOU SHALL FALL THE RAYS OF A GLORY WHICH WILL OWE ITS EXISTENCE TO THE DESIRE OF PLEASING YOU SO MUCH FOR MY PUPIL DEAR DO YOU SUPPOSE HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN LIKE THIS BEFORE
HUMBLE COUNTRY PLEASURES WILL ENLIVEN THE MONOTONY OF MY FUTURE IT SHALL BE MY AMBITION TO ENLARGE THE OASIS ROUND MY HOUSE AND TO GIVE IT THE LORDLY SHADE OF FINE TREES
ACT OR THINK WITHOUT ADDING TO THE ADMIRATION I FEEL FOR YOUR CHARM BOTH OF BODY AND MIND THERE IS IN YOU A RARE COMBINATION OF THE IDEAL THE PRACTICAL AND THE BEWITCHING WHICH SATISFIES ALIKE JUDGMENT A HUSBAND'S PRIDE DESIRE AND HOPE
BUT ONLY ON THE EXPRESS CONDITION OF BEING ALLOWED TO WORK MY WILL UPON THE GRANGE AND MAKE A PARK THERE I HAVE DEMANDED FROM MY FATHER IN SET TERMS A GRANT OF WATER WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT THITHER FROM MAUCOMBE
MARRIAGE SOON BECOMES INTOLERABLE UNLESS THE WOMAN IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT A WOMAN IN SUCH A CASE NEEDS THE CHARM OF A MISTRESS COMBINED WITH THE SOLID QUALITIES OF A WIFE
WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED YOU WILL APPROVE THIS RESERVE ENOUGH THAT NOTHING WAS LACKING EITHER OF SATISFACTION FOR THE MOST FASTIDIOUS SENTIMENT OR OF THAT UNEXPECTEDNESS WHICH BRINGS IN A SENSE ITS OWN SANCTION
BUT ABOVE ALL I HAVE INSISTED ON THE GREATEST SECRECY IN REGARD TO OUR DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS A HUSBAND WHO SUBMITS TO HIS WIFE'S YOKE IS JUSTLY HELD AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE A WOMAN'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE ENTIRELY CONCEALED
LEAVE ME ABSOLUTELY FREE I WOULD PUT NO HINDRANCE IN THE WAY OF YOUR INSPIRING ME WITH A LOVE SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN BUT I AM DETERMINED TO BE YOURS ONLY OF MY OWN FREE GIFT CREATE IN ME THE WISH TO GIVE UP MY FREEDOM
ONLY A SIMPLE COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING BENEATH ONE OF OUR HILLS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THAT NOBLE VALLEY THE PRIDE OF WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE THE BUILDING IS QUITE UNPRETENTIOUS FOUR PEBBLE WALLS COVERED WITH A YELLOWISH WASH
A FRIENDSHIP WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF THESE ADVANTAGES WOULD SHUT ITS EYES TO MANY OF THE IMPERFECTIONS OF HUMANITY NOW THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXISTENCE OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MYSELF AND LOUIS DE L'ESTORADE
ON THE OTHER HAND MARRIAGE WILL REMAIN WHEN PLEASURES HAVE VANISHED AND IT IS THE SOURCE OF INTERESTS FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN THOSE OF THE MAN AND WOMAN ENTERING ON THE ALLIANCE MIGHT IT NOT THEREFORE BE THAT THE ONLY REQUISITE FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE WAS FRIENDSHIP
A LOOK OF YOUTH THE GREATER REFINEMENT WHICH I INTRODUCED INTO THE HOUSE WAS REFLECTED IN HIS PERSON INSENSIBLY I BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO HIS PRESENCE AND MADE ANOTHER SELF OF HIM
SO HERE ARE MY BLACK HAIR AND MY BLACK EYES WHOSE LASHES ACT ACCORDING TO YOU LIKE VENETIAN BLINDS MY COMMANDING AIR AND MY WHOLE PERSON RAISED TO THE RANK OF SOVEREIGN POWER TEN YEARS HENCE DEAR
YOU SEE THAT HE FANCIES HIMSELF VANITY OF MEN THE CHOSEN OF MY HEART JUST AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO LEGAL BONDS NEVERTHELESS I HAVE NOT YET GOT BEYOND THAT EXTERNAL ATTRACTION WHICH GIVES US STRENGTH TO PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL
YOUR FAVORS TO ME HOWEVER SLIGHT WILL ALWAYS MAKE MY HAPPINESS IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE AS NOW FOR I AM SENSIBLE HOW MUCH DIGNITY THERE IS IN OUR PROMISE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S LIBERTY
IN THE NEXT PLACE HE SHARES OUR VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF MY BEAUTY AND IT IS CRUEL FOR HIM TO SEE HOW THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS LIFE HAVE ROBBED HIM OF YOUTH FINALLY HE FELT THE SUPERIORITY OF MY WOMANHOOD OVER HIS MANHOOD
THAT LOUIS HAS SINCE CONFESSED TO ME THE ALARM IT CAUSED HIM TO FIND IN ME SO LITTLE OF THE IGNORANT MAIDEN THEN I LISTENED TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN REPLY HE GOT MIXED UP IN HIS ARGUMENTS AS PEOPLE DO WHEN HANDICAPPED BY FEAR
BY DINT OF CLOSE STUDY I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS LOVE AMOUNTED TO A PASSION ONCE TRANSFORMED INTO AN IDOL WHOSE SLIGHTEST FROWN WOULD TURN HIM WHITE AND TREMBLING I REALIZED THAT I MIGHT VENTURE ANYTHING
DO NOT FANCY I CONCLUDED THAT I ASK THIS FROM ANY WISH TO BE ECCENTRIC IT IS THE GREAT DESIRE I HAVE FOR YOUR RESPECT WHICH PROMPTS MY REQUEST IF YOU OWE THE CROWN OF YOUR LOVE MERELY TO THE LEGAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY
SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR THE PLAGUE WAS TO RUN AWAY FROM IT AS TO MY ARGUMENT OF LOSING MY TRADE MY GOODS OR DEBTS HE QUITE CONFUTED ME HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING WHICH
MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
WHAT WAS MY DUTY TO DO AND I STATED THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH MY BROTHER HAD PRESSED ME TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND I SET AGAINST THEM THE STRONG IMPRESSIONS WHICH I HAD ON MY MIND FOR STAYING THE VISIBLE CALL I SEEMED TO HAVE
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE ORDINARY BURIALS INCREASED IN NUMBER CONSIDERABLY FOR EXAMPLE FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TO JANUARY THIRD
SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALREADY INFECTED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MAY YET THE WEATHER WAS TEMPERATE VARIABLE AND COOL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE HAD STILL SOME HOPES THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED THEM WAS THAT THE CITY WAS HEALTHY
OF ALL DISTEMPERS WHEREOF IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DIED OF THE PLAGUE YET THERE WAS BUT TWENTY EIGHT IN THE WHOLE CITY WITHIN THE WALLS AND BUT NINETEEN IN SOUTHWARK
AND IT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ESPECIALLY AND IN CLARKENWELL SO THAT BY THE SECOND WEEK IN AUGUST CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ALONE BURIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND CLARKENWELL
I OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIM WHO HAVING BEEN MY MAKER HAD AN UNDISPUTED RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN DISPOSING OF ME AND THAT THEN THERE HAD BEEN
WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AND IN WHICH WAS EMBARKED ALL MY EFFECTS IN THE WORLD AND THE OTHER WAS THE PRESERVATION OF MY LIFE IN SO DISMAL A CALAMITY AS I SAW APPARENTLY WAS COMING UPON THE WHOLE CITY AND WHICH
SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
FROM THE BEGINNING OF APRIL ESPECIALLY THEY STOOD AT TWENTY FIVE EACH WEEK TILL THE WEEK FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE TWENTY FIFTH
IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AND THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN IN WHITECHAPPEL THAT IS TO SAY THE BROAD STREET WHERE I LIVED INDEED NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT WAGGONS AND CARTS WITH GOODS
THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
YET THERE DIED NO MORE OF THE PLAGUE ON THE WHOLE SOUTHWARK SIDE OF THE WATER THAN SIXTEEN BUT THIS FACE OF THINGS SOON CHANGED
SAINT BRIDE'S SIX SAINT JAMES'S NINE
TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
I TOLD HIM THAT I INCLINED TO STAY AND TAKE MY LOT IN THAT STATION IN WHICH GOD HAD PLACED ME AND THAT IT SEEMED TO BE MADE MORE ESPECIALLY MY DUTY ON THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WENT TO OXFORD WHERE IT PLEASED GOD TO PRESERVE THEM AND THE DISTEMPER DID NOT AS I HEARD OF SO MUCH AS TOUCH THEM FOR WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT
SAINT BRIDE'S EIGHT
STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT AS IT HAD GOTTEN SOME VENT IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE SECRETARIES OF STATE GOT KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND CONCERNING THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN OF THE TRUTH
THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
WENT UP THE STRADA SAN GREGORIO AND REACHED THE GATES OF SAINT SEBASTIAN
HERE WAS ONE WHOSE GAY TEMPERAMENT WAS NOT FOR A MOMENT ALTERED AS FOR FRANZ HE WAS ENCHANTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH ALBERT HAD SUSTAINED THE NATIONAL HONOR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BANDIT MY DEAR ALBERT HE SAID IF YOU WILL MAKE HASTE
AND THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE DOOR THE COUNT TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HALF PAST TWELVE HE SAID
THE STREET WAS SAFER FOR HIM ALBERT THEN HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE FAMOUS BANDIT CHIEF IN WHOSE EXISTENCE HE HAD FOR SO LONG A TIME REFUSED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE HE HASTENED TO OPEN THE SECRETARY
ANY MONEY IT IS USELESS WHERE IS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT THE LETTER IN THE STREET HE AWAITS THE ANSWER YES I MUST LEARN WHERE WE ARE GOING I WILL SUMMON HIM HITHER IT IS USELESS HE WOULD NOT COME UP TO YOUR APARTMENTS PERHAPS
YOU HAVE SEEN THE MAN WHO DESIRED TO SPEAK WITH YOU FROM YOUR FRIEND HE ASKED OF FRANZ YES I HAVE SEEN HIM HE REPLIED AND HE HAS HANDED THIS LETTER TO ME LIGHT THE CANDLES IN MY APARTMENT
HAS SENT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT A MAN IS WAITING FOR YOU WITH A LETTER
BUT HE WILL NOT MAKE ANY DIFFICULTY AT ENTERING MINE
AND I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER ME AS UNDER ETERNAL OBLIGATIONS TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR THE CARRIAGE
I WAS NEVER IN THEM BUT I HAVE OFTEN RESOLVED TO VISIT THEM
NO MATTER I KNOW IT THE COUNT KNIT HIS BROWS AND REMAINED SILENT AN INSTANT AND IF I WENT TO SEEK VAMPA WOULD YOU ACCOMPANY ME IF MY SOCIETY WOULD NOT BE DISAGREEABLE BE IT SO
AS IF HE HAD THE SINGULAR FACULTY OF SEEING IN THE DARK FRANZ HIMSELF HOWEVER SAW HIS WAY MORE PLAINLY IN PROPORTION AS HE WENT ON TOWARDS THE LIGHT
THAT HE DID NOT HEAR THE NOISE OF HIS FOOTSTEPS WHO COMES THERE CRIED THE SENTINEL WHO WAS LESS ABSTRACTED AND WHO SAW BY THE LAMP LIGHT A SHADOW APPROACHING HIS CHIEF AT THIS CHALLENGE VAMPA ROSE QUICKLY DRAWING AT THE SAME MOMENT A PISTOL FROM HIS GIRDLE
HE ORDERED THE CARRIAGE THEREFORE FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK DESIRING SIGNOR PASTRINI TO INFORM HIM THE MOMENT THAT ALBERT RETURNED TO THE HOTEL AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ALBERT HAD NOT COME BACK FRANZ DRESSED HIMSELF AND WENT OUT TELLING HIS HOST
DID NOT RISE UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
THEN IT IS TO YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT THIS LETTER IS ADDRESSED IS THERE ANY ANSWER INQUIRED FRANZ TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIM YES YOUR FRIEND AT LEAST HOPES SO COME UP STAIRS WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU
ALLOWING HIM TO LEAVE OR ENTER THE CITY AT ANY HOUR OF THE DAY OR NIGHT THE PORTCULLIS WAS THEREFORE RAISED THE PORTER HAD A LOUIS FOR HIS TROUBLE
FRANZ IMAGINED THAT HE SAW SOMETHING LIKE A SENTINEL
THREE ARCADES WERE BEFORE THEM AND THE MIDDLE ONE WAS USED AS A DOOR THESE ARCADES OPENED ON ONE SIDE INTO THE CORRIDOR WHERE THE COUNT AND FRANZ WERE
AND SIGNED BY ALBERT FRANZ READ IT TWICE BEFORE HE COULD COMPREHEND WHAT IT CONTAINED IT WAS THUS WORDED MY DEAR FELLOW THE MOMENT YOU HAVE RECEIVED THIS HAVE THE KINDNESS TO TAKE THE LETTER OF CREDIT FROM MY POCKET BOOK
AND YET I REPEAT TO YOU YOU HAVE CARRIED HIM OFF AND CONVEYED HIM HITHER AND ADDED THE COUNT TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET YOU HAVE SET A RANSOM ON HIM AS IF HE WERE AN UTTER STRANGER WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME ALL THIS
AND HE LIGHTED HIS CIGAR AT VAMPA'S TORCH NOW MY DEAR COUNT HE SAID LET US ON WITH ALL THE SPEED WE MAY I AM ENORMOUSLY ANXIOUS TO FINISH MY NIGHT AT THE DUKE OF BRACCIANO'S THEY FOUND THE CARRIAGE WHERE THEY HAD LEFT IT
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO HIM I HOPE SAID THE COUNT FROWNINGLY THE PRISONER IS THERE REPLIED VAMPA POINTING TO THE HOLLOW SPACE IN FRONT OF WHICH THE BANDIT WAS ON GUARD AND I WILL GO MYSELF AND TELL HIM HE IS FREE THE CHIEF WENT TOWARDS THE PLACE HE HAD POINTED
I AM SURE HE WOULD NOT REFUSE YOU ALBERT'S FREEDOM WHAT INFLUENCE CAN I POSSIBLY HAVE OVER A BANDIT HAVE YOU NOT JUST RENDERED HIM A SERVICE THAT CAN NEVER BE FORGOTTEN WHAT IS THAT HAVE YOU NOT SAVED PEPPINO'S LIFE WELL WELL SAID THE COUNT WHO TOLD YOU THAT
SAID THE COUNTESS TO FRANZ GO WITH ALL SPEED POOR YOUNG MAN PERHAPS SOME ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM I WILL HASTEN REPLIED FRANZ SHALL WE SEE YOU AGAIN TO GIVE US ANY INFORMATION INQUIRED THE COUNTESS YES IF IT IS NOT ANY SERIOUS AFFAIR
THAT HE WAS GOING TO PASS THE NIGHT AT THE DUKE OF BRACCIANO'S THE HOUSE OF THE DUKE OF BRACCIANO IS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL IN ROME THE DUCHESS ONE OF THE LAST HEIRESSES OF THE COLONNAS DOES ITS HONORS WITH THE MOST CONSUMMATE GRACE AND THUS THEIR FETES
THE COACHMAN WENT UP THE VIA DI RIPETTA AND THE PORTA SAN PAOLA AND WHEN THEY WERE TWO HUNDRED YARDS OUTSIDE AS THE FRENCHMAN BECAME SOMEWHAT TOO FORWARD BEPPO PUT A BRACE OF PISTOLS TO HIS HEAD THE COACHMAN PULLED UP
GOING ALONG A NARROW PATH THAT LED OVER THE IRREGULAR AND BROKEN SURFACE OF THE CAMPAGNA AND FINALLY HE DISAPPEARED IN THE MIDST OF THE TALL RED HERBAGE WHICH SEEMED LIKE THE BRISTLING MANE OF AN ENORMOUS LION NOW SAID THE COUNT
SHOULD BE RESPECTED BY YOU AND HOW HAVE I BROKEN THAT TREATY YOUR EXCELLENCY YOU HAVE THIS EVENING CARRIED OFF AND CONVEYED HITHER THE VICOMTE
YOU ARE DECIDEDLY RIGHT AND WE MAY REACH THE PALAZZO BY TWO O'CLOCK SIGNOR LUIGI CONTINUED ALBERT
SAID THE COUNT BUT PEPPINO INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES SEIZED THE COUNT'S HAND AND COVERED IT WITH KISSES AH SAID THE COUNT YOU HAVE THEN NOT FORGOTTEN THAT I SAVED YOUR LIFE
HAVE A EUROPEAN CELEBRITY FRANZ AND ALBERT HAD BROUGHT TO ROME LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION TO THEM AND THEIR FIRST QUESTION ON HIS ARRIVAL WAS TO INQUIRE THE WHEREABOUTS OF HIS TRAVELLING COMPANION FRANZ REPLIED THAT HE HAD LEFT HIM AT THE MOMENT
AT TORLONIA'S WITH THE COUNTESS G THEN HE DREW HIS WATCH FROM HIS POCKET THAT HE MIGHT SEE HOW TIME SPED HALF PAST ONE ONLY SAID HE WHY THE DEVIL DO YOU ROUSE ME AT THIS HOUR TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE FREE YOUR EXCELLENCY MY DEAR FELLOW
ONE MUST LIVE IN THE NEEDS OF THE DAY THAT IS FORGET ONESELF TO FORGET HIMSELF IN SLEEP WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOW AT LEAST TILL NIGHTTIME HE COULD NOT GO BACK NOW TO THE MUSIC SUNG BY THE DECANTER WOMEN SO HE MUST FORGET HIMSELF IN THE DREAM OF DAILY LIFE
THE WIDOW OF A STAFF CAPTAIN KALININ CAME WITH A REQUEST IMPOSSIBLE AND UNREASONABLE BUT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS HE GENERALLY DID MADE HER SIT DOWN HEARD HER TO THE END ATTENTIVELY WITHOUT INTERRUPTING HER AND GAVE HER DETAILED ADVICE AS TO HOW AND TO WHOM TO APPLY
AND HER FACE SUDDENLY SOFTENED SHE SEEMED TO BE PULLING HERSELF TOGETHER FOR A FEW SECONDS AS THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND GETTING UP RAPIDLY SHE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR WELL SHE LOVES MY CHILD HE THOUGHT
SAID A FIRM PLEASANT WOMAN'S VOICE AND THE STERN POCKMARKED FACE OF MATRONA PHILIMONOVNA THE NURSE WAS THRUST IN AT THE DOORWAY WELL WHAT IS IT MATRONA QUERIED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH
WOKE UP AT HIS USUAL HOUR THAT IS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING NOT IN HIS WIFE'S BEDROOM BUT ON THE LEATHER COVERED SOFA IN HIS STUDY HE TURNED OVER HIS STOUT WELL CARED FOR PERSON ON THE SPRINGY SOFA AS THOUGH HE WOULD SINK INTO A LONG SLEEP AGAIN
A HANDSOME SUSCEPTIBLE MAN OF THIRTY FOUR WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE THE MOTHER OF FIVE LIVING AND TWO DEAD CHILDREN AND ONLY A YEAR YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF
THE MOST UNPLEASANT THING OF ALL WAS THAT HIS PECUNIARY INTERESTS SHOULD IN THIS WAY ENTER INTO THE QUESTION OF HIS RECONCILIATION WITH HIS WIFE AND THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE LED ON BY HIS INTERESTS THAT HE MIGHT SEEK A RECONCILIATION WITH HIS WIFE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SALE OF THE FOREST THAT IDEA HURT HIM
THAT NOTHING COULD COME OF IT BUT FALSITY THAT TO AMEND TO SET RIGHT THEIR RELATIONS WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HER ATTRACTIVE AGAIN AND ABLE TO INSPIRE LOVE OR TO MAKE HIM AN OLD MAN NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOVE EXCEPT DECEIT AND LYING NOTHING COULD COME OF IT NOW
ALTHOUGH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS COMPLETELY IN THE WRONG AS REGARDS HIS WIFE AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF THIS HIMSELF ALMOST EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE EVEN THE NURSE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA'S CHIEF ALLY WAS ON HIS SIDE
HE VIGOROUSLY EMBRACED THE PILLOW ON THE OTHER SIDE AND BURIED HIS FACE IN IT BUT ALL AT ONCE HE JUMPED UP
HE FIRMLY HELD THOSE VIEWS ON ALL THESE SUBJECTS WHICH WERE HELD BY THE MAJORITY AND BY HIS PAPER AND HE ONLY CHANGED THEM WHEN THE MAJORITY CHANGED THEM OR MORE STRICTLY SPEAKING HE DID NOT CHANGE THEM BUT THEY IMPERCEPTIBLY CHANGED OF THEMSELVES WITHIN HIM
THE MUSCLES OF THE CHEEK CONTRACTED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HER PALE NERVOUS FACE WHAT DO YOU WANT SHE SAID IN A RAPID DEEP UNNATURAL VOICE DOLLY HE REPEATED WITH A QUIVER IN HIS VOICE
LIVING IN A CERTAIN SOCIETY OWING TO THE NEED ORDINARILY DEVELOPED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION FOR SOME DEGREE OF MENTAL ACTIVITY TO HAVE VIEWS WAS JUST AS INDISPENSABLE AS TO HAVE A HAT IF THERE WAS A REASON FOR HIS PREFERRING LIBERAL TO CONSERVATIVE VIEWS
THERE WAS NO SOLUTION BUT THAT UNIVERSAL SOLUTION WHICH LIFE GIVES TO ALL QUESTIONS EVEN THE MOST COMPLEX AND INSOLUBLE
WITH PAIN AND WRATH SHE UTTERED THE WORD SO TERRIBLE TO HERSELF STRANGER HE LOOKED AT HER AND THE FURY EXPRESSED IN HER FACE ALARMED AND AMAZED HIM
VULGAR IN FLIRTING WITH ONE'S GOVERNESS BUT WHAT A GOVERNESS
WHICH WERE HELD ALSO BY MANY OF HIS CIRCLE IT AROSE NOT FROM HIS CONSIDERING LIBERALISM MORE RATIONAL BUT FROM ITS BEING IN CLOSER ACCORDANCE WITH HIS MANNER OF LIFE THE LIBERAL PARTY SAID THAT IN RUSSIA EVERYTHING IS WRONG
THE CHILDREN RAN WILD ALL OVER THE HOUSE THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS QUARRELED WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER AND WROTE TO A FRIEND ASKING HER TO LOOK OUT FOR A NEW SITUATION FOR HER THE MAN COOK HAD WALKED OFF THE DAY BEFORE JUST AT DINNER TIME THE KITCHEN MAID AND THE COACHMAN
AND HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO BE DONE
TRANSLATED BY CONSTANCE GARNETT PART ONE CHAPTER ONE HAPPY FAMILIES ARE ALL ALIKE EVERY UNHAPPY FAMILY IS UNHAPPY IN ITS OWN WAY
AND CERTAINLY STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HAD MANY DEBTS AND WAS DECIDEDLY SHORT OF MONEY THE LIBERAL PARTY SAID THAT MARRIAGE IS AN INSTITUTION QUITE OUT OF DATE AND THAT IT NEEDS RECONSTRUCTION AND FAMILY LIFE CERTAINLY AFFORDED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH LITTLE GRATIFICATION
SHOULD THEY HAVE ANY MILK SHOULD NOT A NEW COOK BE SENT FOR AH LET ME ALONE LET ME ALONE SHE SAID AND GOING BACK TO HER BEDROOM SHE SAT DOWN IN THE SAME PLACE AS SHE HAD SAT WHEN TALKING TO HER HUSBAND CLASPING TIGHTLY HER THIN HANDS WITH THE RINGS THAT SLIPPED DOWN ON HER BONY FINGERS
THAT SHE MUST TAKE SOME STEP TO PUNISH HIM PUT HIM TO SHAME AVENGE ON HIM SOME LITTLE PART AT LEAST OF THE SUFFERING HE HAD CAUSED HER SHE STILL CONTINUED TO TELL HERSELF THAT SHE SHOULD LEAVE HIM BUT SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE
AS IT WAS EVEN IN THE COURSE OF THESE THREE DAYS THE YOUNGEST WAS UNWELL FROM BEING GIVEN UNWHOLESOME SOUP AND THE OTHERS HAD ALMOST GONE WITHOUT THEIR DINNER THE DAY BEFORE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO AWAY BUT CHEATING HERSELF SHE WENT ON ALL THE SAME SORTING OUT HER THINGS
WIPED HIS FACE SQUARED HIS CHEST AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM IT WAS FRIDAY AND IN THE DINING ROOM THE GERMAN WATCHMAKER WAS WINDING UP THE CLOCK STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH REMEMBERED HIS JOKE ABOUT THIS PUNCTUAL BALD WATCHMAKER
AND HOW VULGARLY SHE SHOUTED HE SAID TO HIMSELF REMEMBERING HER SHRIEK AND THE WORDS SCOUNDREL AND MISTRESS AND VERY LIKELY THE MAIDS WERE LISTENING HORRIBLY VULGAR HORRIBLE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH STOOD A FEW SECONDS ALONE
LAUGHING ONLY WITH HIS EYES AND PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS HE WATCHED HIS MASTER WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS SILENT A MINUTE THEN A GOOD HUMORED AND RATHER PITIFUL SMILE SHOWED ITSELF ON HIS HANDSOME FACE
EH MATVEY HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD IT'S ALL RIGHT SIR SHE WILL COME ROUND SAID MATVEY COME ROUND YES SIR DO YOU THINK SO WHO'S THERE ASKED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH HEARING THE RUSTLE OF A WOMAN'S DRESS AT THE DOOR IT'S I
YOU HAVE NEITHER HEART NOR HONORABLE FEELING
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA MATVEY REPEATED AS THOUGH IN DOUBT YES INFORM HER HERE TAKE THE TELEGRAM GIVE IT TO HER AND THEN DO WHAT SHE TELLS YOU YOU WANT TO TRY IT ON MATVEY UNDERSTOOD BUT HE ONLY SAID YES SIR
WHAT COULD IT MEAN HAD MY EYES DECEIVED ME AND WAS I REALLY AS MAD AS THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BELIEVE ME TO BE IF I DISCLOSED THE OBJECT OF MY SUSPICIONS I HASTENED TO RETURN HOME AND ELIZABETH EAGERLY DEMANDED THE RESULT
BUT WITH FEELINGS OF PEACE AND GENTLENESS THAT WILL HEAL INSTEAD OF FESTERING THE WOUNDS OF OUR MINDS ENTER THE HOUSE OF MOURNING MY FRIEND BUT WITH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION FOR THOSE WHO LOVE YOU AND NOT WITH HATRED FOR YOUR ENEMIES
WHEN SHE AGAIN LIVED IT WAS ONLY TO WEEP AND SIGH SHE TOLD ME THAT THAT SAME EVENING WILLIAM HAD TEASED HER TO LET HIM WEAR A VERY VALUABLE MINIATURE THAT SHE POSSESSED OF YOUR MOTHER THIS PICTURE IS GONE
I FEAR MY FRIEND THAT I SHALL RENDER MYSELF TEDIOUS BY DWELLING ON THESE PRELIMINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY WERE DAYS OF COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS AND I THINK OF THEM WITH PLEASURE MY COUNTRY MY BELOVED COUNTRY
AND THE OFFICER GUESSED THE CAUSE OF MY VISIT THE BALLOTS HAD BEEN THROWN THEY WERE ALL BLACK AND JUSTINE WAS CONDEMNED I CANNOT PRETEND TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THEN FELT I HAD BEFORE EXPERIENCED SENSATIONS OF HORROR
RISE MY POOR GIRL SAID ELIZABETH WHY DO YOU KNEEL IF YOU ARE INNOCENT I AM NOT ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES I BELIEVED YOU GUILTLESS NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY EVIDENCE UNTIL I HEARD THAT YOU HAD YOURSELF DECLARED YOUR GUILT
I SLACKENED MY PROGRESS I COULD HARDLY SUSTAIN THE MULTITUDE OF FEELINGS THAT CROWDED INTO MY MIND I PASSED THROUGH SCENES FAMILIAR TO MY YOUTH BUT WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS HOW ALTERED EVERY THING MIGHT BE DURING THAT TIME
I CONTEMPLATED THE LAKE THE WATERS WERE PLACID ALL AROUND WAS CALM AND THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS THE PALACES OF NATURE WERE NOT CHANGED BY DEGREES THE CALM AND HEAVENLY SCENE RESTORED ME AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TOWARDS GENEVA
THERE WAS THE SAME CANDOUR THE SAME VIVACITY BUT IT WAS ALLIED TO AN EXPRESSION MORE FULL OF SENSIBILITY AND INTELLECT SHE WELCOMED ME WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION YOUR ARRIVAL MY DEAR COUSIN SAID SHE FILLS ME WITH HOPE
WHO HAD GONE ON BEFORE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND WE ACCORDINGLY RESTED ON A SEAT UNTIL THEY SHOULD RETURN PRESENTLY ERNEST CAME AND ENQUIRED IF WE HAD SEEN HIS BROTHER HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN PLAYING WITH HIM
ON WHOM THE PUBLIC INDIGNATION WAS TURNED WITH RENEWED VIOLENCE CHARGING HER WITH THE BLACKEST INGRATITUDE SHE HERSELF WEPT AS ELIZABETH SPOKE BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER MY OWN AGITATION AND ANGUISH WAS EXTREME DURING THE WHOLE TRIAL
HE WHO WOULD SPEND EACH VITAL DROP OF BLOOD FOR YOUR SAKES WHO HAS NO THOUGHT NOR SENSE OF JOY EXCEPT AS IT IS MIRRORED ALSO IN YOUR DEAR COUNTENANCES WHO WOULD FILL THE AIR WITH BLESSINGS AND SPEND HIS LIFE IN SERVING YOU HE BIDS YOU WEEP
THIS WAS A DIRE BLOW TO POOR ELIZABETH
IN THESE LAST MOMENTS I FEEL THE SINCEREST GRATITUDE TOWARDS THOSE WHO THINK OF ME WITH KINDNESS HOW SWEET IS THE AFFECTION OF OTHERS TO SUCH A WRETCH AS I AM IT REMOVES MORE THAN HALF MY MISFORTUNE
AND I FEEL AS IF I COULD DIE IN PEACE NOW THAT MY INNOCENCE IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY YOU DEAR LADY AND YOUR COUSIN THUS THE POOR SUFFERER TRIED TO COMFORT OTHERS AND HERSELF
ELIZABETH ALSO SUFFERED EXTREME ANGUISH ABOUT FIVE IN THE MORNING I DISCOVERED MY LOVELY BOY WHOM THE NIGHT BEFORE I HAD SEEN BLOOMING AND ACTIVE IN HEALTH STRETCHED ON THE GRASS LIVID AND MOTIONLESS
I AM SAID SHE THE COUSIN OF THE UNHAPPY CHILD WHO WAS MURDERED OR RATHER HIS SISTER FOR I WAS EDUCATED BY AND HAVE LIVED WITH HIS PARENTS EVER SINCE AND EVEN LONG BEFORE HIS BIRTH IT MAY THEREFORE BE
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE INDEED WHO WOULD CREDIT THAT JUSTINE MORITZ WHO WAS SO AMIABLE AND FOND OF ALL THE FAMILY COULD SUDDENLY BECOME SO CAPABLE OF SO FRIGHTFUL SO APPALLING A CRIME JUSTINE MORITZ
VICTOR HE IS MURDERED I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE YOU BUT WILL SIMPLY RELATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TRANSACTION LAST THURSDAY MAY SEVENTH I MY NIECE AND YOUR TWO BROTHERS WENT TO WALK IN PLAINPALAIS
I SHOULD HAVE WILLINGLY GIVEN IT TO HER SO MUCH DO I ESTEEM AND VALUE HER A MURMUR OF APPROBATION FOLLOWED ELIZABETH'S SIMPLE AND POWERFUL APPEAL BUT IT WAS EXCITED BY HER GENEROUS INTERFERENCE AND NOT IN FAVOUR OF POOR JUSTINE
THE OTHER FAR MORE DREADFULLY MURDERED WITH EVERY AGGRAVATION OF INFAMY THAT COULD MAKE THE MURDER MEMORABLE IN HORROR JUSTINE ALSO WAS A GIRL OF MERIT AND POSSESSED QUALITIES WHICH PROMISED TO RENDER HER LIFE HAPPY NOW
MY DEAR VICTOR YOU HAVE PROBABLY WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR A LETTER TO FIX THE DATE OF YOUR RETURN TO US AND I WAS AT FIRST TEMPTED TO WRITE ONLY A FEW LINES MERELY MENTIONING THE DAY ON WHICH I SHOULD EXPECT YOU
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO DISCOVER WHAT I KNEW OF THE MURDERER AND CAUSE INSTANT PURSUIT TO BE MADE BUT I PAUSED WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE STORY THAT I HAD TO TELL A BEING WHOM I MYSELF HAD FORMED AND ENDUED WITH LIFE
IT WAS DAWN AND SHE QUITTED HER ASYLUM THAT SHE MIGHT AGAIN ENDEAVOUR TO FIND MY BROTHER IF SHE HAD GONE NEAR THE SPOT WHERE HIS BODY LAY IT WAS WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEWILDERED WHEN QUESTIONED BY THE MARKET WOMAN WAS NOT SURPRISING
ALL WAS THE WORK OF MY THRICE ACCURSED HANDS YE WEEP UNHAPPY ONES BUT THESE ARE NOT YOUR LAST TEARS AGAIN SHALL YOU RAISE THE FUNERAL WAIL AND THE SOUND OF YOUR LAMENTATIONS SHALL AGAIN AND AGAIN BE HEARD FRANKENSTEIN
WHICH STOOD OVER THE MANTEL PIECE IT WAS AN HISTORICAL SUBJECT
NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY OF THE MURDERED CHILD HAD BEEN AFTERWARDS FOUND THE WOMAN ASKED HER WHAT SHE DID THERE BUT SHE LOOKED VERY STRANGELY AND ONLY RETURNED A CONFUSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE ANSWER SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK
AND TAKING HIS FINGERS OFF THE PUBLIC PULSE DON'T YOU NOAH LOTT CHESTNUT HILL
UNTIL WE GET USED TO IT ALCOHOL THE FOREFATHER OF A HOLD OVER BOOZERINE IN THE RAW STATE FROM THE LATIN WORDS ALCO AND HAUL MEANING
CALLED FOR AND DEFIED THEM NEVER DID THEY COME ODSBODDIKINS WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE COME TO DO IN TARASCON NEVERTHELESS TARTARIN ALWAYS EXPECTED TO RUN UP AGAINST THEM
AND WITH MUCH ENTHUSIASM INVITED HIM TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY THEREON THE MAIN STEM IN THE WORKS INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD HIS FINGERS ON THE PUBLIC PULSE
AND THE REST OF THE TIME TO LADLE OUT CASTING VOTES AT THE GUNMAKER'S

NOW I HAVE GOT THE TRICK OF BREAKING MY WORD I SHALL DO IT EVERY DAY I MUST GO TO ROEHAMPTON TO DAY BUT TIS ALL ONE YOU DO NOT CARE MUCH FOR SEEING ME
HE HAD BECOME THE SWELL BRUISER THE ARISTOCRATIC PUGILIST THE CRACK BULLY OF THE LOCAL CORINTHIANS FOR THE TARASCONERS FROM HIS BUILD BEARING STYLE THAT ASPECT OF A GUARD'S
IN THE RIGHT HE CARRIED A SWORD CANE IN HIS LEFT POCKET A LIFE PRESERVER IN THE RIGHT A REVOLVER
TOGETHER WITH A HURLY BURLY OF HOUNDS CRACKING OF WHIPS AND BLOWING OF WHISTLES AND HUNTING HORNS IT'S SPLENDID TO SEE UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LACK OF GAME AN
TRUMPETER'S CHARGER WHICH FEARS NO NOISE HIS REPUTATION AS A HERO COMING FROM NOBODY KNEW WHENCE OR FOR WHAT AND SOME SCRAMBLINGS FOR COPPERS AND A FEW KICKS TO THE LITTLE RAGAMUFFINS BASKING AT HIS DOORWAY
LITTLE INDEED
WHICH SETS A TOPER LAUGHING AND SINGING AFTER THAT WHEN THOROUGHLY BRACED UP THEY RISE WHISTLE THE DOGS TO HEEL SET THE GUNS ON HALF COCK AND GO ON THE SHOOT
I COMPLAINED BITTERLY TO HIM ABOUT SUCH AN INHUMAN INVENTION WHICH RUSHED THROUGH SPACE WITH A MAN'S EXTERIOR AND LEFT HIS INTERIOR TO BUMP ITS WAY DOWNSTAIRS
SOME FATHER OF THE CHURCH HAS SAID I FEEL THERE ARE TWO MEN IN ME
THE SILLY SYCLOPEDIA A TERRIBLE THING IN THE FORM OF A LITERARY TORPEDO WHICH IS LAUNCHED FOR HILARIOUS PURPOSES ONLY INACCURATE IN EVERY PARTICULAR CONTAINING COPIOUS ETYMOLOGICAL DERIVATIONS
IT STARTS OFF WITH M AND THEN THERE IS EIGHT BARS REST UNTIL IT COMES TO SANTOS THIS IS A FRENCH CUSTOM EVERY MAN IN FRANCE BEGINS HIS FIRST NAME WITH M
THAT I COULD RISE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT HIS KINDLY COLLABORATION ONE DAY WHILE IN NEW YORK I WENT UP TO THE FIFTY NINTH FLOOR OF A SKY REMOVER BUILDING THE ELEVATOR WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS THAT DAY
A MUSICAL TERM WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED HERE BECAUSE THE MUSICAL UNION MIGHT GET SORE A FLAT A PEOPLE COOP SEVEN ROOMS AND A LANDLORD WITH HOT AND COLD GAS AND RUNNING SERVANTS

FROM THE LATIN WORD ABSCONDITTO MEANING TO GRAB THE LONG GREEN AND HIKE FOR THE BAD LANDS ABSINTHE THE NATIONAL HEADACHE OF THE FRENCH A JAG BUILDER WHICH IS MOSTLY WORMWOOD
FROM THE GREATEST TO THE LEAST THE CHASE IS THE LOCAL CRAZE AND SO IT HAS EVER BEEN SINCE THE MYTHOLOGICAL TIMES WHEN THE TARASQUE AS THE COUNTY DRAGON WAS CALLED
THAT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE CLUB BY THE SHORTEST CUT HE WENT OVER THE TOWN BY THE LONGEST AND DARKEST WAY ROUND THROUGH A MASS OF VILE PALTRY ALLEYS AT THE MOUTH OF WHICH THE RHONE COULD BE SEEN OMINOUSLY GLEAMING
THE HARD WORK A MAN DOES ON THE GOLF LINKS TO GIVE HIMSELF AN APPETITE FOR SAUSAGE LINKS ANGEL SOMETHING BEHIND A SHOW AND ALWAYS SOMETHING BEHIND APE
THEY GO OUT INTO THE REAL COUNTRY TWO OR THREE LEAGUES FROM TOWN THEY GATHER IN KNOTS OF FIVE OR SIX
GAVE ME A FAIRLY GOOD CIGAR AND BEGAN TO LOOK HARD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ELEVATOR LAST WEEK WHILE SEARCHING FOR SOME MISSING GOVERNMENT BONDS
EVERY SUNDAY MORNING OUT HE WOULD MARCH IN A NEW CAP AND BACK HE WOULD STRUT EVERY SUNDAY EVENING WITH A MERE THING OF SHREDS THE LOFT OF BAOBAB VILLA
OH I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE EXCLAIMED IN A TONE OF GREAT DISMAY AND BEGAN PICKING THEM UP AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD FOR THE ACCIDENT OF THE GOLDFISH KEPT RUNNING IN HER HEAD AND SHE HAD A VAGUE SORT OF IDEA THAT THEY MUST BE COLLECTED AT ONCE AND PUT BACK INTO THE JURY BOX OR THEY WOULD DIE
LIE FLAT ON YOUR BACK ON THE GOOD GREEN EARTH AND ROAR TILL THE GREAT VAULT ECHOES YOUR MIRTH AS HE WALKED IN THE CITY TO SYM THERE CAME SOUNDS ENVENOMED WITH FEAR AND HATE
THEY CLIMBED THE TREES TIS A BOOTLESS TASK TO SAY SO OVER AGAIN OR ASK THE CAUSE OF IT ALL OR THE REASON WHY THEY NEVER FELT HAPPIER UP ON HIGH FOR JOI ASKED WHY AND JOI WAS A FOOL AND NEVER A GLUG OF THE FINE OLD SCHOOL
BUT THE AUNT SAID TOITY AND DRAT THE BOY HE SHALL PLAY SAID THE FATHER SOME NOBLE PART WHO KNOWS BUT IT MAY BE IN LETTERS OR ART TIS A DIGNIFIED BUSINESS TO MAKE FOLK THINK BUT THE AUNT CRIED WHAT GO MESSING WITH INK AND SMEAR ALL HIS FINGERS AND TAKE TO DRINK
ALICE COULD SEE THIS AS SHE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO LOOK OVER THEIR SLATES BUT
WHY SUNLIGHT AND WORMS SAID THE LITTLE BLUE WREN SIX THE END OF JOI THEY CLIMBED THE TREES
THEY WERE JUST BEGINNING TO WRITE THIS DOWN ON THEIR SLATES WHEN THE WHITE RABBIT INTERRUPTED
AND TREATING FOES WITH THE CALM CONTEMPT OF THE ONE WHO KNOWS AND EVERY SPIDER WHO HEAVES A LINE AND TRUSTS TO HIS LUCK WHEN THE DAY IS FINE
SAID HE WHENEVER YOUR WONDERING EYES LOOK OUT ON THE GLORY OF EARTH AND SKIES SHALL YOU MID THE BLESSING OF FIELDS A BLOOM FLING BLAME AT THE BLIND MAN PRISONED IN GLOOM SO JOI HAD A SON
WHENEVER A DEWDROP CLINGS TO A GOSSAMER THREAD AND GLITTERS AND SWINGS DEEP IN HUMILITY BOW YOUR HEAD TO A THING FOR A BLUNDERING RNORTAL'S DREAD AND THERE CAME TO SYM IN HIS LATER YOUTH WITH THE FIRST CLEAR GLANCE IN THE FACE OF GUILE
WHY CLIMB SAID HE WHEN YOU REACH THE TOP THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO AND YOU HAVE TO STOP UNLESS YOU DROP AND THE HIGHER YOU ARE THE WORSE YOU FLOP AND EVERY CRICKET THAT CHIRPS AT EVE AND SCOFFS AT THE FOLLY OF FOOLS WHO GRIEVE
THERE'S NO NAME SIGNED AT THE END IF YOU DIDN'T SIGN IT SAID THE KING THAT ONLY MAKES THE MATTER WORSE YOU MUST HAVE MEANT SOME MISCHIEF
AND FREQUENTLY ASKED A DEPOSIT IN CASH THEN EVERY GLUG HE WENT HOME TO HIS REST WITH HIS HEAD IN A BAG AND HIS TOES TO THE WEST FOR THEY KNEW IT WAS BEST SINCE THEIR GRANDPAS SLEPT WITH THEIR TOES TO THE WEST
AND THE CHOKING OF THE SUPPRESSED GUINEA PIGS FILLED THE AIR MIXED UP WITH THE DISTANT SOBS OF THE MISERABLE MOCK TURTLE SO SHE SAT ON WITH CLOSED EYES AND HALF BELIEVED HERSELF IN WONDERLAND THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE HAD BUT TO OPEN THEM AGAIN
GIVE HIM A CHANCE SAID HIS FATHER JOI HIS HEAD IS ABNORMALLY LARGE FOR A BOY BUT HIS AUNT SAID PIFFIE IT'S CRAMMED WITH BOSH WHY HE DON'T KNOW THE RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS OF GOSH NOR THE NAMES OF THE NEPHEWS OF GOOD KING SPLOSH IN GOSH
WHERE I'VE HEARD IT REPORTED LARGE PROFITS ARE MADE BESIDES HE CAN SELL US CHEAP BUTTONS AND BRAID SO POOR YOUNG SYM HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL WHERE THE FIRST THING TAUGHT IS THE GOLDEN RULE DO UNTO OTHERS THE TEACHER SAID
HE TRUSTS TO YOU TO SET THEM FREE EXACTLY AS WE WERE MY NOTION WAS THAT YOU HAD BEEN BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT AN OBSTACLE THAT CAME BETWEEN HIM AND OURSELVES AND IT
WHY IT WAS SCREAMINGLY LAUGHABLE SEEMINGLY ASKING FOR NOTHING BUT STONES AND THE KING SAID HAW AND THE QUEEN SAID OH OUR DRAWING ROOM NOW IS A HEAVENLY SHOW OF LARGE OVERMANTELS AND WHATNOTS AND CHAIRS
THERE WAS A GENERAL CLAPPING OF HANDS AT THIS IT WAS THE FIRST REALLY CLEVER THING THE KING HAD SAID THAT DAY THAT PROVES HIS GUILT SAID THE QUEEN IT PROVES NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID ALICE
AND IN BRICKS OR ROAD METAL FOR GOODS YOU WILL SETTLE INDENTED BY YOUR MISTER GHONES CRIED THE GLUGS PRAISINGLY WHY HOW AMAZINGLY SMART OF INDUSTRIOUS GHONES
RULE FORTY TWO ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT EVERYBODY LOOKED AT ALICE I'M NOT A MILE HIGH SAID ALICE YOU ARE SAID THE KING NEARLY TWO MILES HIGH ADDED THE QUEEN
AND EVERYBODY LAUGHED LET THE JURY CONSIDER THEIR VERDICT THE KING SAID FOR ABOUT THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT DAY NO NO SAID THE QUEEN SENTENCE FIRST VERDICT AFTERWARDS
OR OUR INDUSTRIES SOON WILL BE GONE TO THE DOGS AND THE KING SAID BOSH YOU'RE UN GLUGGISH AND RUDE AND THE QUEEN SAID WHAT AN ABSURD ATTITUDE THEN THE GLUGS CRIED DOWN WITH POLITICAL QUACKS HOW DID OUR GRANDPAS LOOK AT A TAX SO THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE
WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE THAT'S THE JURY OF COURSE I GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO WHY THAT MUST BE WHAT HE DID WITH THE TARTS YOU KNOW BUT IT GOES ON THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU SAID ALICE WHY
WHO CLIMBED A TREE WHEN THE WEATHER WAS CALM AND THEY HANGED POOR JOI ON A SNUFFLEBUST PALM THEN THEY SANG A PSALM DID THOSE PIOUS GLUGS NEATH THE SNUFFLEBUST PALM AND EVERY BEE THAT KISSES A FLOW'R
BUT ALL OF THE TALE THAT IS SO FAR TOLD HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE OGS OF PODGE AND THEIR CRAFTY DODGE AND THE TRADE IN PICKLES AND GLUE TO TRADE WITH THE GLUGS CAME THE OGS TO GOSH AND THEY SAID IN SEDUCTIVE TONES
THEN SPLOSH THE KING ROSE UP AND SAID IT'S NOT POLITE BUT HE'S SAFER DEAD AND THERE'S NOT MUCH ROOM IN THE LAND OF GOSH FOR A GLUG NAMED JOI AND A KING CALLED SPLOSH AND EVERY GLUG FLUNG HIGH HIS HAT AND CRIED
AND THE GLUGS WERE TICKLED WITH WHAT THEY'D DONE AND AFTER THAT IF A DAY SHOULD COME WHEN A GLUG FELT EXTRA SPECIALLY GLUM HE'D CALL HIS CHILDREN AROUND HIS KNEE AND TELL THAT TALE WITH A CHUCKLE OF GLEE AND SHOULD A LITTLE GLUG GIRL OR BOY SEE NAUGHT OF A JOKE IN THE FATE OF JOI
POETRY AND PROSE FOR THE NEXT MONTH ANNE LIVED IN WHAT FOR AVONLEA MIGHT BE CALLED A WHIRL OF EXCITEMENT THE PREPARATION OF HER OWN MODEST OUTFIT FOR REDMOND WAS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE
WITH A PRIVATE VIEW FOR SPECIALLY INVITED FRIENDS THE EVENING BEFORE ON THE ELEVENTH DAY OF FEBRUARY MISSUS GREGGORY AND HER DAUGHTER ARRIVED AT HILLSIDE FOR A TEN DAYS VISIT NOT UNTIL AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF PLEADING AND ARGUMENT HOWEVER HAD BILLY BEEN ABLE TO BRING THIS ABOUT
IT HAD BEEN THE GREAT GOOD AND PLEASURE WHICH THE VISIT WOULD BRING TO MISSUS GREGGORY THAT HAD BEEN THE FINAL STRAW TO TIP THE SCALES ON THE ELEVENTH OF FEBRUARY THEREFORE IN THE COMPANY OF THE ONCE SCORNED PEGGY AND MARY JANE ALICE GREGGORY AND HER MOTHER HAD ARRIVED AT HILLSIDE
BANISH GILBERT'S IMAGE FROM HER CASTLE IN SPAIN BUT SOMEHOW HE WENT ON BEING THERE SO ANNE BEING IN A HURRY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT AND PURSUED HER AERIAL ARCHITECTURE WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT HER HOME O'DREAMS WAS BUILT AND FURNISHED BEFORE DIANA SPOKE AGAIN
HELPING HER ARRANGE PICTURES LAY OUT GARDENS AND ACCOMPLISH SUNDRY OTHER TASKS WHICH A PROUD AND MELANCHOLY HERO EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED BENEATH HIS DIGNITY ANNE TRIED TO
CONDITIONS SEEMED MUCH WORSE HERE THAN AT HELIUM AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I BREATHED AT ALL THERE WERE A FEW MEN STILL CONSCIOUS AND TO ONE OF THESE I SPOKE IF I CAN OPEN THESE DOORS IS THERE A MAN WHO CAN START THE ENGINES I ASKED I CAN
THAT THIS CAN'T HELP MAKING SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIANA AND ME I'M SURE I CAN'T TELL HER ALL MY SECRETS AFTER THIS SHE MIGHT TELL FRED AND
EARNESTLY SOLICITOUS THAT IT SHOULD BE A SUCCESS SHE EVEN AS HE SOMETIMES HALF IRRITABLY REMEMBERED HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT SHE REALIZED HE BELONGED TO ART BEFORE HE DID TO HIMSELF AND WHEN HE HAD INDIGNANTLY DENIED THIS SHE HAD ONLY LAUGHED AND THROWN A KISS AT HIM
AS IF HE WANTED KATE'S OPINION ON THAT OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT CONCERNED HIM AND BILLY ONCE TORN BY JEALOUSY AND EXASPERATED AT THE FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS OF THEIR QUIET HOURS TOGETHER HE HAD COMPLAINED OPENLY ACTUALLY BILLY IT'S WORSE THAN MARIE'S WEDDING HE DECLARED
I CRIED THERE IS THERE MUST BE SOME WAY AND JOHN CARTER WHO HAS FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH A STRANGE WORLD FOR LOVE OF YOU WILL FIND IT AND WITH MY WORDS THERE CREPT ABOVE THE THRESHOLD OF MY CONSCIOUS MIND A SERIES OF
DEJAH THORIS AND I WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY HAD COLLECTED IN A SUNKEN GARDEN WITHIN AN INNER COURTYARD OF THE PALACE WE CONVERSED IN LOW TONES WHEN WE CONVERSED AT ALL
DAZED GLANCE OF COMPREHENSION TURNED AND SPED NOISELESSLY BACK THROUGH THE SPRUCE WOOD NEVER STOPPING TILL SHE GAINED HER OWN GABLE ROOM WHERE SHE SAT BREATHLESSLY DOWN BY HER WINDOW AND TRIED TO COLLECT HER SCATTERED WITS DIANA AND FRED ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
APPARELLED IN CELESTIAL LIGHT WEARING A GLORY AND A FRESHNESS NOT VISIBLE TO THOSE WHO LIKE HERSELF AND CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH LOOKED AT THINGS ONLY THROUGH PROSE WHEN'S THE WEDDING TO BE SHE ASKED AFTER A PAUSE THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST
HER VOICE WHEN SHE RESUMED CARRIED THE STERN NOTE SO FAMILIAR TO BILLY IN HER FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER AS I PRESUME MISTER ARKWRIGHT HAS TOLD YOU WE HAVE MET WITH MANY CHANGES IN OUR LIFE CHANGES WHICH NECESSITATED A NEW HOME AND A NEW MODE OF LIVING
I KNEW I COULD TRUST FATHER TO PICK ME OUT A NICE LITTLE SECOND MOTHER HE SAID PROUDLY IT'S A FINE THING TO HAVE A FATHER YOU CAN DEPEND ON TEACHER I JUST LOVE MISS LAVENDAR GRANDMA IS PLEASED TOO SHE SAYS SHE'S REAL GLAD FATHER DIDN'T PICK OUT AN AMERICAN FOR HIS SECOND WIFE BECAUSE
AND AGAIN AS BILLY THOUGHT OF IT BILLY'S HEART REJOICED
HE'S VERY NICE AND JOLLY BUT HE'S JUST FRED WRIGHT IT IS ALWAYS A VERY PUZZLING QUESTION WHAT CAN SOMEBODY SEE IN SOMEBODY ELSE BUT HOW FORTUNATE AFTER ALL THAT IT IS SO FOR IF EVERYBODY SAW ALIKE WELL
THIS ISN'T AN UNDERSTUDY LIKE MARIE'S WEDDING YOU KNOW SHE FINISHED DEMURELY THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT BERTRAM HAD BREATHED FERVENTLY BUT EVEN AS HE SAID THE WORDS HE GREW SICK WITH FEAR WHAT IF AFTER ALL THIS WERE AN UNDERSTUDY TO WHAT WAS TO COME LATER WHEN MUSIC
EVERYBODY CONCERNED IN MISS LAVENDAR'S STORY WAS VERY HAPPY
I AM GLAD DIANA IS SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED BUT WHEN MY TURN COMES IF IT EVER DOES I DO HOPE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE THRILLING ABOUT IT BUT THEN DIANA THOUGHT SO TOO ONCE
OH WELL I CAN STILL CALL HIM MARY JANE RETORTED BILLY WITH AIRY DISDAIN ALL THIS HOWEVER SO FAR AS BILLY COULD SEE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST HELPING ALONG THE CAUSE THAT HAD BECOME SO DEAR TO HER
WE WENT OUR WAYS WITH SMILES UPON OUR FACES AND SORROW GNAWING AT OUR HEARTS
VERY FEARSOME INDEED TO SAY TO MISSUS GREGGORY THEN BILLY REMEMBERED HER CAUSE AND TOOK HEART BILLY WAS SPELLING IT NOW WITH A CAPITAL C FOR A LONG MINUTE MISSUS GREGGORY DID NOT ANSWER FOR SO LONG A MINUTE
YOU MUST BE MY BRIDESMAID YOU KNOW ANNE PROMISE ME THAT WHEREVER YOU MAY BE WHEN I'M MARRIED
KISSING DEJAH THORIS A DOZEN TIMES AND COMMANDING WOOLA WHO WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED ME TO REMAIN AND GUARD HER I BOUNDED WITH MY OLD AGILITY AND STRENGTH TO THE HIGH RAMPARTS OF THE PALACE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT I WAS HEADED TOWARD THE GOAL OF THE HOPES OF
BESIDES WHEN I'M DOING THIS I'M NOT TELEPHONING YOU TO COME AND AMUSE ME
AND WILL HAVE TO STAY ALL NIGHT SEVERAL TIMES PROBABLY YOU MISSUS GREGGORY
ANNE STUMBLED SUDDENLY ON IT ONE EVENING WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO ORCHARD SLOPE BY THE WOOD CUT AND CAME OUT INTO THE BARRY GARDEN DIANA BARRY AND FRED WRIGHT WERE STANDING TOGETHER UNDER THE BIG WILLOW DIANA WAS LEANING AGAINST THE GRAY TRUNK HER LASHES CAST DOWN ON VERY CRIMSON CHEEKS
THAT ALL DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE ENGAGED TO ANSWERED DIANA WITH THAT
BUT AFTER ALL THAT'S BETTER THAN ONE OF US BEING SHORT AND FAT AND THE OTHER TALL AND LEAN LIKE MORGAN SLOANE AND HIS WIFE MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT ALWAYS MAKES HER THINK OF THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT WHEN SHE SEES THEM TOGETHER WELL SAID ANNE TO HERSELF THAT NIGHT AS SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR BEFORE HER GILT FRAMED MIRROR
AND LET ME ALONE HEREAFTER IN FACT WE MUST BE STRANGERS FOR THE FUTURE I WILL THEN BE YOUR FRIEND OR BROTHER OR ANYTHING YOU WISH IF YOU WILL ONLY LET ME CONTINUE TO SEE YOU BUT TELL ME WHY I CANNOT BE ANYTHING MORE
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOTHING CONTRABAND I TELEPHONED THE DUCHESS TO SEND SOME OF HER PEOPLE TO MEET YOUR LUGGAGE AND NOT TO EXPECT YOU HERSELF UNTIL DINNER TIME AS YOU WERE TAKING TEA WITH US WAS THAT RIGHT THIS WAY COME OUTSIDE THE BARRIER WHAT A RABBLE
BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MISSUS MARKHAM SAID HE I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE
THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
IF YOU STAND TILL MORNING NOW THEN SAID I UNCLOSING MY HAND BUT STILL STANDING BEFORE HIM ASK ME SOME OTHER TIME WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN RETURNED HE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO PASS ME AGAIN
BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS
WELL MISTER MARKHAM WHAT IS IT SAID THE YOUNG MOTHER ACCOSTING ME WITH A PLEASANT SMILE I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS BOOK AND IF YOU PLEASE TO TAKE IT AND PERUSE IT AT YOUR LEISURE
BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN AND HOW YOUR SISTER'S ROOTS HAVE PROSPERED IN MY CHARGE ADDED SHE AS SHE OPENED THE GATE AND WE SAUNTERED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND TALKED OF THE FLOWERS THE TREES AND THE BOOK
AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY
A GREAT CALM TOOK ITS PLACE AND JANE DROPPED QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS WASHED AND BRUSHED AND GREATLY REFRESHED
WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
IN TIME FOR TEA BUT OFFERED TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATELY PREPARED IF HE WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO PARTAKE OF IT NOT ANY FOR ME I THANK YOU REPLIED HE I SHALL BE AT HOME IN A FEW MINUTES OH BUT DO STAY AND TAKE A LITTLE
WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME
BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
YOU MUST SUPPOSE ABOUT THREE WEEKS PASSED OVER MISSUS GRAHAM AND I WERE NOW ESTABLISHED FRIENDS OR BROTHER AND SISTER AS WE RATHER CHOSE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES
AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
AND HER OWN MAID WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE IN THE DUCHESS'S HOUSEHOLD IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS ON THE PLATFORM AND HER HAND WAS IN DERYCK'S THAT IS RIGHT DEAR HE SAID ALL FIT AND WELL I CAN SEE NOW HAND OVER YOUR KEYS
AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER WHY SO MISTER MILLWARD ASKED I HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED
AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND ME WITH A BANG THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND MADE MY MOTHER SCREAM AND GAVE A MOMENTARY RELIEF TO MY EXCITED FEELINGS
OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
I WOULD NOT EVEN LOOK AT HIM HE WENT INTO THE PUMP ROOM AFTERWARDS BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE FOLLOWED HIM FOR ALL THE WORLD SUCH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HIM AND YOUR BROTHER PRAY SEND ME SOME NEWS OF THE LATTER I AM QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT HIM
BUT AM AFRAID YOU NEVER THINK OF ME I WILL NOT SAY ALL THAT I COULD OF THE FAMILY YOU ARE WITH BECAUSE I WOULD NOT BE UNGENEROUS OR SET YOU AGAINST THOSE YOU ESTEEM BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHOM TO TRUST
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR VACATION ANNE SHE SAID AS THEY LEFT THE GRAVEYARD ANNE NODDED YES I COULD ROLL THE WORD AS A SWEET MORSEL UNDER MY TONGUE I THINK THE SUMMER IS GOING TO BE LOVELY
NOR TO THE PLAY EXCEPT GOING IN LAST NIGHT WITH THE HODGES FOR A FROLIC AT HALF PRICE THEY TEASED ME INTO IT AND I WAS DETERMINED THEY SHOULD NOT SAY I SHUT MYSELF UP BECAUSE TILNEY WAS GONE WE HAPPENED TO SIT BY THE MITCHELLS
AND HER DEMANDS IMPUDENT WRITE TO JAMES ON HER BEHALF NO JAMES SHOULD NEVER HEAR ISABELLA'S NAME MENTIONED BY HER AGAIN ON HENRY'S ARRIVAL FROM WOODSTON
WORSE AND THEN THERE ARE THE TWINS SOMEHOW I DON'T BELIEVE THEIR UNCLE WILL EVER REALLY SEND FOR THEM PERHAPS COLLEGE MAY BE AROUND THE BEND IN THE ROAD BUT I HAVEN'T GOT TO THE BEND YET AND I DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT LEST I MIGHT GROW DISCONTENTED
LIFE WOULD BE A SORRY BUSINESS WITHOUT THEM WITH THEM IT'S GRAND AND GREAT HOLD FAST TO YOUR IDEALS ANNE I SHALL TRY BUT I HAVE TO LET GO MOST OF MY THEORIES SAID ANNE LAUGHING A LITTLE
MY LITTLE MOTHER USED ALWAYS TO SIT BESIDE ME AND HOLD MY HAND TILL I WENT TO SLEEP I EXPECT SHE SPOILED ME MOTHERS DO SOMETIMES YOU KNOW NO ANNE DID NOT KNOW THIS ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT IMAGINE IT SHE THOUGHT SADLY OF HER LITTLE MOTHER
DO YOU THINK YOU WILL EVER GET TO COLLEGE OH I DON'T KNOW ANNE LOOKED DREAMILY AFAR TO THE OPAL TINTED HORIZON MARILLA'S EYES WILL NEVER BE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY ARE NOW ALTHOUGH WE ARE SO THANKFUL TO THINK THAT THEY WILL NOT GET
FOR YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE SHOULDERS HE HAS BUT SOMETIMES CONCLUDED PAUL WITH A SIGH AND A MEDITATIVE AIR I REALLY THINK PORRIDGE WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME ANNE PERMITTED HERSELF A SMILE SINCE PAUL WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
AND NEVER SULLY IT BY ANY FAILURE IN TRUTH AND SINCERITY I FEAR THE NAME OF FRIENDSHIP IS OFTEN DEGRADED TO A KIND OF INTIMACY THAT HAS NOTHING OF REAL FRIENDSHIP IN IT YES LIKE GERTIE PYE'S AND JULIA BELL'S
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING VERY UNEXPECTED LETTER FROM ISABELLA BATH APRIL MY DEAREST CATHERINE
I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN SEE THEM BUT YOU COULD SEE ROCK PEOPLE OF YOUR OWN YOU'RE ONE OF THE KIND THAT CAN WE'RE BOTH THAT KIND YOU KNOW TEACHER HE ADDED SQUEEZING HER HAND CHUMMILY ISN'T IT SPLENDID TO BE THAT KIND TEACHER
I'LL BE ELEVEN YOU'D NEVER THINK IT TO LOOK AT ME WOULD YOU GRANDMA SAYS I'M VERY SMALL FOR MY AGE AND THAT IT'S ALL BECAUSE I DON'T EAT ENOUGH PORRIDGE I DO MY VERY BEST BUT GRANDMA GIVES SUCH GENEROUS PLATEFULS
HE IS THE ONLY MAN I EVER DID OR COULD LOVE AND I TRUST YOU WILL CONVINCE HIM OF IT THE SPRING FASHIONS ARE PARTLY DOWN AND THE HATS THE MOST FRIGHTFUL YOU CAN IMAGINE I HOPE YOU SPEND YOUR TIME PLEASANTLY
AND HER TRICKS HAVE NOT ANSWERED I DO NOT BELIEVE SHE HAD EVER ANY REGARD EITHER FOR JAMES OR FOR ME AND I WISH I HAD NEVER KNOWN HER IT WILL SOON BE AS IF YOU NEVER HAD SAID HENRY
YOU KNOW TEACHER I WISH SHE WOULD LEAVE THE LAMP IN MY ROOM TILL I GO TO SLEEP THOUGH SHE TAKES IT RIGHT OUT AS SOON AS SHE TUCKS ME UP BECAUSE SHE SAYS I MUSTN'T BE A COWARD I'M NOT SCARED BUT I'D RATHER HAVE THE LIGHT
BUT HE'S SPLENDID WHEN YOU DO GET TO KNOW HIM I LOVE HIM THE BEST IN ALL THE WORLD AND GRANDMA IRVING NEXT AND THEN YOU TEACHER I'D LOVE YOU NEXT TO FATHER IF IT WASN'T MY DUTY TO LOVE GRANDMA IRVING BEST BECAUSE SHE'S DOING SO MUCH FOR ME
WHO AS YOU MAY REMEMBER WAS AMAZINGLY DISPOSED TO FOLLOW AND TEASE ME BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY AFTERWARDS HE GOT WORSE AND BECAME QUITE MY SHADOW MANY GIRLS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN FOR NEVER WERE SUCH ATTENTIONS
THERE'S NOTHING MEAN ABOUT GRANDMA I CAN TELL YOU EVER SINCE YOU AND I HAD THAT TALK ABOUT PRAYING GOING HOME FROM SUNDAY SCHOOL THAT DAY TEACHER WHEN YOU SAID WE OUGHT TO PRAY ABOUT ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES
I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR WHIPPING ANTHONY NONSENSE DEAR HE DESERVED IT AND IT AGREED WITH HIM YOU HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE WITH HIM SINCE AND HE HAS COME TO THINK THERE'S NOBODY LIKE YOU
FOR ONE THING MISSUS MORGAN IS COMING TO THE ISLAND IN JULY AND PRISCILLA IS GOING TO BRING HER UP I FEEL ONE OF MY OLD THRILLS AT THE MERE THOUGHT I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME ANNE
THEN SHE PAUSED ABRUPTLY IN THE DELICATE WHITE BROWED FACE BESIDE HER WITH ITS CANDID EYES AND MOBILE FEATURES THERE WAS STILL FAR MORE OF THE CHILD THAN OF THE WOMAN
I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN SAID ANNE THOUGHTFULLY AND I KNOW I HAVE SO MUCH TO FEEL THANKFUL FOR OH SO MUCH MY WORK AND PAUL IRVING AND THE DEAR TWINS AND ALL MY FRIENDS
LOSE NO TIME MY DEAREST SWEETEST CATHERINE IN WRITING TO HIM AND TO ME WHO EVER AM ET CETERA SUCH A STRAIN OF SHALLOW ARTIFICE COULD NOT IMPOSE EVEN UPON CATHERINE
THE MOTHER WHO HAD THOUGHT HER SO PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL AND WHO HAD DIED SO LONG AGO AND WAS BURIED BESIDE HER BOYISH HUSBAND IN THAT UNVISITED GRAVE FAR AWAY ANNE COULD NOT REMEMBER HER MOTHER AND FOR THIS REASON SHE ALMOST ENVIED PAUL
WE MAY BE SURE THAT BECKY AND BRIGGS LOOKED OUT THOSE AUGUST NAMES IN THE PEERAGE AND FOLLOWED THE NOBLE RACES UP THROUGH ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE FAMILY TREE MY LORD STEYNE
WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN REBECCA CRAWLEY
ANOTHER GREAT AND EXCEEDING HONOUR WAS VOUCHSAFED TO THE VIRTUOUS BECKY LADY STEYNE'S CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO MISTER RAWDON CRAWLEY'S DOOR AND THE FOOTMAN INSTEAD OF DRIVING DOWN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS BY HIS TREMENDOUS KNOCKING HE APPEARED TO BE INCLINED TO DO
MY LADY TUFTO MISSUS BUTE CRAWLEY IN THE COUNTRY AND OTHER LADIES WHO HAD COME INTO CONTACT WITH MISSUS RAWDON CRAWLEY TO CRY FIE AT THE IDEA OF THE ODIOUS LITTLE ADVENTURESS MAKING HER CURTSEY BEFORE THE SOVEREIGN
AND TO TRIP DOWN AGAIN TO WAIT UPON THE GREAT PEER SHE FOUND HIM GRINNING OVER THE BOWL SHE WAS DISCOVERED AND SHE BLUSHED A LITTLE THANK YOU MONSEIGNEUR SHE SAID
AND SAINT JAMES'S STREET TOWARDS THE OLD BRICK PALACE WHERE THE STAR OF BRUNSWICK WAS IN WAITING TO RECEIVE HIS NOBLES AND GENTLEFOLKS BECKY FELT AS IF SHE COULD BLESS THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS
AFTER A PAUSE AND IN A VERY SAD VOICE HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS SHE SPOKE AND SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
MESSRS JONES AND ROBINSON'S
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT HAD SHE BEEN ONE SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME THE CHARACTER PERFECTLY
ON THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE WHERE BECKY KEPT THE CARDS OF HER VISITORS
HE SAID GOOD NATUREDLY YOU SILLY LITTLE FIBSTER I HEARD YOU IN THE ROOM OVERHEAD WHERE I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU WERE PUTTING A LITTLE ROUGE ON YOU MUST GIVE SOME OF YOURS TO MY LADY GAUNT WHOSE COMPLEXION IS QUITE PREPOSTEROUS
IN THEIR GREAT FAMILY CARRIAGE JUST NEWLY BUILT AND READY FOR THE BARONET'S ASSUMPTION OF THE OFFICE OF HIGH SHERIFF OF HIS COUNTY DROVE UP TO THE LITTLE HOUSE IN CURZON STREET TO THE EDIFICATION OF RAGGLES
AND IN WHICH BECKY KEPT A NUMBER OF USEFUL AND PERHAPS VALUABLE THINGS
SOME FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS SINCE AS THE MOST BRILLIANT COSTUME OF THE MOST FAMOUS BEAUTY OF THE PRESENT SEASON A SCORE OF YEARS HENCE THAT TOO THAT MILLINER'S WONDER WILL HAVE PASSED INTO THE DOMAIN OF THE ABSURD
BUT I HOPE YOUR LORDSHIP IS ORTHODOX SAID THE LITTLE LADY WITH A TOSS OF HER HEAD AND MANY LADIES ROUND ABOUT WHISPERED AND TALKED AND MANY GENTLEMEN NODDED AND WHISPERED AS THEY SAW WHAT MARKED ATTENTION THE GREAT NOBLEMAN WAS PAYING TO THE LITTLE ADVENTURESS
AND FORGOT THAT THERE WAS NO MONEY IN THE CHEST AT HOME DUNS ROUND THE GATE TRADESMEN TO COAX AND WHEEDLE NO GROUND TO WALK UPON IN A WORD AND AS SHE WENT TO COURT IN THE CARRIAGE THE FAMILY CARRIAGE
AND BREECHES AND SILK STOCKINGS SIMPERING ON A SOFA FROM UNDER HIS CURLY BROWN WIG SHE HAD HIM PAINTED IN A BROOCH AND WORE IT
ANSWERED MISSUS RAWDON PLAINTIVELY AND SHE RUBBED HER CHEEK WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF AS IF TO SHOW THERE WAS NO ROUGE AT ALL ONLY GENUINE BLUSHES AND MODESTY IN HER CASE ABOUT THIS WHO CAN TELL
AND TO APPEAR ON DRURY LANE STAGE AMONGST A CROWD WHICH ASSEMBLED THERE TO GREET THE KING THE KING THERE HE WAS BEEFEATERS WERE BEFORE THE AUGUST BOX THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE LORD OF THE POWDER CLOSET
OF HIS KINGDOM DO YOU REMEMBER
OF COUNTENANCE FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEAVENS HOW MUCH MORE CAN OLD LADY CASTLEMOULDY
LAUGHING MISCHIEVOUSLY AND HAVING ENJOYED FOR SOME TIME THE DISCOMFITURE OF MY LORD WHO HATED POOR BRIGGS FOR INTERRUPTING
WHEN THIS ANGEL WAS ADMITTED INTO THE PARADISE OF A COURT WHICH SHE COVETED
RELENTED AND ONLY DELIVERED IN A COUPLE OF CARDS ON WHICH WERE ENGRAVEN THE NAMES OF THE MARCHIONESS OF STEYNE AND THE COUNTESS OF GAUNT IF THESE BITS OF PASTEBOARD
AND I HEARD THE BEDROOM DOOR OPEN AND THEN YOU CAME DOWNSTAIRS
YOU'LL BE ASKED TO DINNER NEXT WEEK AND GARE AUX FEMMES LOOK OUT AND HOLD YOUR OWN HOW THE WOMEN WILL BULLY YOU THIS WAS A VERY LONG SPEECH FOR A MAN OF FEW WORDS LIKE MY LORD STEYNE
THEN SHE WALKED TO MISTER RAGGLES INQUIRED ABOUT HIS CHILDREN AFFECTIONATELY AND GAVE HIM FIFTY POUNDS ON ACCOUNT THEN SHE WENT TO THE LIVERY MAN FROM WHOM SHE JOBBED HER CARRIAGES AND GRATIFIED HIM WITH A SIMILAR SUM
AND I HOPE THIS WILL BE A LESSON TO YOU SPAVIN SHE SAID AND THAT ON THE NEXT DRAWING ROOM DAY MY BROTHER SIR PITT
YOU POOR LITTLE EARTHENWARE PIPKIN YOU WANT TO SWIM DOWN THE STREAM ALONG WITH THE GREAT COPPER KETTLES
AH WHAT SHALL I DO LORD STEYNE FOR I AM VERY VERY UNHAPPY LORD STEYNE MADE NO REPLY EXCEPT BY BEATING THE DEVIL'S TATTOO AND BITING HIS NAILS AT LAST HE CLAPPED HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD AND FLUNG OUT OF THE ROOM
WHO WAS WATCHING FROM HIS GREENGROCER'S SHOP AND SAW FINE PLUMES WITHIN AND ENORMOUS BUNCHES OF FLOWERS IN THE BREASTS OF THE NEW LIVERY COATS OF THE FOOTMEN SIR PITT IN A GLITTERING UNIFORM
THE HYPOCRITE BEING ACTED ELLISTON BEING MANAGER DOWTON AND LISTON PERFORMERS TWO BOYS HAD LEAVE FROM THEIR LOYAL MASTERS TO GO OUT FROM SLAUGHTER HOUSE SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE EDUCATED
SO TO BE AND TO BE THOUGHT A RESPECTABLE WOMAN WAS BECKY'S AIM IN LIFE AND SHE GOT UP THE GENTEEL WITH AMAZING ASSIDUITY READINESS AND SUCCESS WE HAVE SAID THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE A FINE LADY
LOMBARD STREET RAWDON HEARD BECKY LAUGHING IN THE NIGHT ONCE OR TWICE IT WAS ONLY HER DELIGHT AT GOING TO GAUNT HOUSE AND FACING THE LADIES THERE SHE SAID WHICH AMUSED HER SO BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT SHE WAS OCCUPIED WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER THOUGHTS
I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF UNDERSTANDING YOU SAID HE
MISS LUCAS PERCEIVED HIM FROM AN UPPER WINDOW AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND INSTANTLY SET OUT TO MEET HIM ACCIDENTALLY IN THE LANE BUT LITTLE HAD SHE DARED TO HOPE THAT SO MUCH LOVE AND ELOQUENCE AWAITED HER THERE
AND ANSWER EVERY WISH OF HER HEART THEY AGREED THAT MISSUS BENNET SHOULD ONLY HEAR OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT BEING ALARMED ON THE SCORE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT BUT EVEN THIS PARTIAL COMMUNICATION GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN
AND YOU MAY BE VERY CERTAIN THAT I SHALL AVAIL MYSELF OF IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED AND MISTER BENNET WHO COULD BY NO MEANS WISH FOR SO SPEEDY A RETURN
IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
SHE SOON REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND CALMLY REPLIED WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED MY DEAR ELIZA
SHE TALKED TO ELIZABETH AGAIN AND AGAIN COAXED AND THREATENED HER BY TURNS SHE ENDEAVOURED TO SECURE JANE IN HER INTEREST BUT JANE WITH ALL POSSIBLE MILDNESS DECLINED INTERFERING
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE DISCUSSION OF MISTER COLLINS'S OFFER WAS NOW NEARLY AT AN END AND ELIZABETH HAD ONLY TO SUFFER FROM THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS NECESSARILY ATTENDING IT
MISTER COLLINS MEANWHILE WAS MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE ON WHAT HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT TOO WELL OF HIMSELF TO COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVES HIS COUSIN COULD REFUSE HIM AND THOUGH HIS PRIDE WAS HURT
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO BE EQUALLY SATISFIED THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD MEANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY PROTESTING AGAINST HIS PROPOSALS BUT SHE DARED NOT BELIEVE IT
AND HAD SOON THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ITS HAPPY EFFECT JANE'S TEMPER WAS NOT DESPONDING AND SHE WAS GRADUALLY LED TO HOPE THOUGH THE DIFFIDENCE OF AFFECTION SOMETIMES OVERCAME THE HOPE THAT BINGLEY WOULD RETURN TO NETHERFIELD
AND SIR WILLIAM GAVE IT AS HIS DECIDED OPINION THAT WHENEVER MISTER COLLINS SHOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THE LONGBOURN ESTATE IT WOULD BE HIGHLY EXPEDIENT THAT BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE AT SAINT JAMES'S
SAID JANE AS SHE FINISHED IT IS IT NOT CLEAR ENOUGH DOES IT NOT EXPRESSLY DECLARE THAT CAROLINE NEITHER EXPECTS NOR WISHES ME TO BE HER SISTER THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HER BROTHER'S INDIFFERENCE
THAT WHEN CALLED INTO ACTION SHE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED EVERY BETTER FEELING TO WORLDLY ADVANTAGE CHARLOTTE THE WIFE OF MISTER COLLINS WAS A MOST HUMILIATING PICTURE
SHE RESOLVED TO GIVE HER THE INFORMATION HERSELF AND THEREFORE CHARGED MISTER COLLINS WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONGBOURN TO DINNER TO DROP NO HINT OF WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE ANY OF THE FAMILY
THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED A SHEET OF ELEGANT LITTLE HOT PRESSED PAPER WELL COVERED WITH A LADY'S FAIR FLOWING HAND AND ELIZABETH SAW HER SISTER'S COUNTENANCE CHANGE AS SHE READ IT
WOULD ONLY INCREASE THE IRRITATION SHE TALKED ON THEREFORE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FROM ANY OF THEM TILL THEY WERE JOINED BY MISTER COLLINS
IF THEREFORE SHE ACTUALLY PERSISTS IN REJECTING MY SUIT PERHAPS IT WERE BETTER NOT TO FORCE HER INTO ACCEPTING ME BECAUSE IF LIABLE TO SUCH DEFECTS OF TEMPER SHE COULD NOT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO MY FELICITY
BUT IF SHE IS REALLY HEADSTRONG AND FOOLISH I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE WOULD ALTOGETHER BE A VERY DESIRABLE WIFE TO A MAN IN MY SITUATION WHO NATURALLY LOOKS FOR HAPPINESS IN THE MARRIAGE STATE
THAN SHE ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND CONGRATULATED BOTH HIM AND HERSELF
DETAINED FIRST BY THE CIVILITY OF MISTER COLLINS WHOSE INQUIRIES AFTER HERSELF AND ALL HER FAMILY WERE VERY MINUTE AND THEN BY A LITTLE CURIOSITY SATISFIED HERSELF WITH WALKING TO THE WINDOW AND PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR
FOR THOUGH FEELING ALMOST SECURE AND WITH REASON FOR CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN TOLERABLY ENCOURAGING HE WAS COMPARATIVELY DIFFIDENT SINCE THE ADVENTURE OF WEDNESDAY HIS RECEPTION HOWEVER WAS OF THE MOST FLATTERING KIND
STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND BE SATISFIED THAT WE SHALL TAKE NO OFFENCE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MY GRATITUDE IS WARMLY EXCITED BY SUCH AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION
MY DEAR MADAM REPLIED HE LET US BE FOR EVER SILENT ON THIS POINT FAR BE IT FROM ME HE PRESENTLY CONTINUED
MY CONDUCT MAY I FEAR BE OBJECTIONABLE IN HAVING ACCEPTED MY DISMISSION FROM YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIPS INSTEAD OF YOUR OWN BUT WE ARE ALL LIABLE TO ERROR
OF MY ROOM I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE THE LIBRARY TO MYSELF AS SOON AS MAY BE NOT YET HOWEVER IN SPITE OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER HUSBAND DID MISSUS BENNET GIVE UP THE POINT
SHE ADDED IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
HER MISTER BENNET RAISED HIS EYES FROM HIS BOOK AS SHE ENTERED AND FIXED THEM ON HER FACE WITH A CALM UNCONCERN WHICH WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALTERED BY HER COMMUNICATION
BUT STILL HE WOULD BE HER HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING HIGHLY EITHER OF MEN OR MATRIMONY MARRIAGE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER OBJECT
AND THAT HAPPEN WHAT MIGHT SHE WOULD NOT SACRIFICE THE PLEASURE OF HAVING ME CONSTANTLY WITH HER ADDING THAT THOSE WHO WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT WERE FREE TO STAY AWAY SO MUCH I HAD HEARD ONE DAY WHEN PRUDENCE HAD SAID TO MARGUERITE
MARGUERITE ROSE FROM TABLE AND JOINED THE DUKE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHERE SHE TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO INDUCE HIM TO FORGET THE INCIDENT BUT THE OLD MAN WOUNDED IN HIS DIGNITY BORE HER A GRUDGE FOR IT
YES AN EXCELLENT IDEA I STAMMERED NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS SAYING WELL I WILL ARRANGE THAT SAID MARGUERITE FREEING MY HAND AND INTERPRETING MY WORDS ACCORDING TO HER OWN DESIRE
A WEEK LATER MARGUERITE WAS SETTLED IN HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND I WAS INSTALLED AT POINT DU JOUR THEN BEGAN AN EXISTENCE WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING TO YOU
VERY MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY AND NOT POSSESSING THE FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFE THEY LEAD THEY GAMBLE THEN AND WITH THIS RESULT OR ELSE THEY GAIN AND THEN THOSE WHO LOSE SERVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HORSES AND MISTRESSES
AND I WILL SAY GOOD BYE FOREVER TO THE LIFE FOR WHICH I NOW BLUSH YOU WON'T EVER REPROACH ME FOR THE PAST TELL ME TEARS CHOKED MY VOICE I COULD ONLY REPLY BY CLASPING MARGUERITE TO MY HEART WELL
MOUNTING AS HIGH AS THE FIRST STORY I LOOKED AT THE HOUSE SO LONG THAT I BEGAN BY THINKING OF IT AS MINE SO PERFECTLY DID IT EMBODY THE DREAM THAT I WAS DREAMING I SAW MARGUERITE AND MYSELF THERE
THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT VIEW FROM THE GARDEN WHICH IS AT THE HEIGHT OF AN ORDINARY FIRST FLOOR ON THE LEFT THE AQUEDUCT OF MARLY CLOSES IN THE HORIZON
I LOST ONLY WHAT I WAS ABLE TO PAY AND GAINED ONLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOSE FOR THE REST CHANCE WAS ON MY SIDE I MADE NO DEBTS AND I SPENT THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS WHEN I DID NOT GAMBLE
SHE WOULD WRITE TO ME IN THE MORNING THAT SHE WOULD DINE WITH ME NOT AT HOME BUT AT SOME RESTAURANT IN PARIS OR IN THE COUNTRY I WOULD CALL FOR HER AND WE WOULD DINE AND GO ON TO THE THEATRE OFTEN HAVING SUPPER AS WELL
THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO JOIN MY FATHER AND SISTER HAD NOW ARRIVED AND I DID NOT GO BOTH OF THEM WROTE TO ME FREQUENTLY BEGGING ME TO COME TO THESE LETTERS I REPLIED AS BEST I COULD
WHEN AN ADROIT GAMBLER WOULD HAVE LEFT IT SETTLING ONE THING AGAINST ANOTHER I FOUND MYSELF IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS
AFTER A BUTTERFLY OR A DRAGON FLY THIS COURTESAN WHO HAD COST MORE MONEY IN BOUQUETS THAN WOULD HAVE KEPT A WHOLE FAMILY IN COMFORT WOULD SOMETIMES SIT ON THE GRASS FOR AN HOUR EXAMINING THE SIMPLE FLOWER WHOSE NAME SHE BORE
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SHE READ MANON LESCAUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I FOUND HER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING NOTES IN THE BOOK AND SHE ALWAYS DECLARED THAT WHEN A WOMAN LOVES SHE CAN NOT DO AS MANON DID
AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
AND WHO HAD NO CONCERN WITH US ALONE WITH NATURE IN THE SPRING TIME OF THE YEAR THAT ANNUAL PARDON AND SHUT OFF FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY I COULD HIDE MY LOVE AND LOVE WITHOUT SHAME OR FEAR
AND THAT HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE THAT LET MARGUERITE LEAVE THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID TO ME AND AS IN THE PAST I WILL GIVE HER ALL THAT SHE REQUIRES IF NOT LET HER ASK NOTHING MORE FROM ME
FOR THE REST NOT A PENNY OF DEBT THIS THEN WAS MY POSITION WHEN I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MARGUERITE YOU CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY EXPENSES SOON INCREASED
I CAME TO PARIS STUDIED LAW WAS CALLED TO THE BAR AND LIKE MANY OTHER YOUNG MEN PUT MY DIPLOMA IN MY POCKET AND LET MYSELF DRIFT AS ONE SO EASILY DOES IN PARIS
NO MORE BARRIERS MY MARGUERITE WE LOVE WHAT MATTERS ALL THE REST OH YES I LOVE YOU MY ARMAND SHE MURMURED PUTTING HER TWO ARMS AROUND MY NECK I LOVE YOU AS I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER LOVE
I WILL DO WITHOUT IT BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I DON'T IN THE LEAST KNOW PRUDENCE WAS NO DOUBT GOING TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT I ENTERED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG MYSELF AT MARGUERITE'S FEET
AND FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN I POSSESSED I BORROWED AT PARIS A SUM EQUAL TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY BORROWED AND PAID BACK I WAS THEN ONCE MORE IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT RECKONING MY ALLOWANCE
WHERE ASKED PRUDENCE YONDER AND MARGUERITE POINTED TO THE HOUSE IN QUESTION AH DELICIOUS REPLIED PRUDENCE DO YOU LIKE IT VERY MUCH
I FEARED ABOVE ALL THAT SHE MIGHT THINK ME CAPABLE OF SHIRKING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF EVERY CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HER LOVE FOR ME MIGHT LEAD HER IT THUS CAME ABOUT THAT THE DUKE RECEIVING NO REPLY CEASED TO WRITE
MY LOVE FOR HER HAD SO DISTURBING AN INFLUENCE UPON ME THAT EVERY MOMENT I SPENT AWAY FROM MARGUERITE WAS LIKE A YEAR AND THAT I FELT THE NEED OF CONSUMING THESE MOMENTS IN THE FIRE OF SOME SORT OF PASSION
WE SENT FOR PRUDENCE AND ALL THREE SET OFF AFTER MARGUERITE HAD GIVEN NANINE ORDERS TO TELL THE DUKE THAT SHE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE FINE DAY
I HAVE TRAVELLED A GOOD DEAL AND SEEN MUCH GRANDER THINGS
I PASSED WHOLE DAYS AT THE FEET OF MY MISTRESS WE OPENED THE WINDOWS UPON THE GARDEN AND AS WE WATCHED THE SUMMER RIPENING IN ITS FLOWERS
I LIKEWISE MARVELED AT THE NUMEROUS MEDUSAS INCLUDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEIR BREED THE COMPASS JELLYFISH UNIQUE TO THE FALKLAND SEAS
THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE CANADIAN REPLIED BUT WHERE'S THE NAUTILUS GOING I'M UNABLE TO SAY NED AFTER THE SOUTH POLE
NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS MY GALLANT CONSEIL FELT THE SAME SYMPTOMS SUFFERED THE SAME SUFFERINGS YET NEVER LEFT MY SIDE HE HELD MY HAND HE KEPT ENCOURAGING ME AND I EVEN HEARD HIM MUTTER
CONSEIL KEPT STILL I STARED AT THE CAPTAIN HIS FACE HAD RESUMED ITS USUAL EMOTIONLESSNESS HE CROSSED HIS ARMS HE PONDERED THE NAUTILUS DID NOT STIR THE CAPTAIN THEN BROKE INTO SPEECH GENTLEMEN
THEN HIS MEN SIMULTANEOUSLY STAKED IT OFF AT SEVERAL POINTS AROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE SOON THEIR PICKS WERE VIGOROUSLY ATTACKING THIS COMPACT MATTER AND HUGE CHUNKS WERE LOOSENED FROM ITS MASS
WHEN THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES BEFORE NOON WE RAISED LAND TO THE WEST
BUT THERE AREN'T TEN FEET OF WATER AHEAD OR ASTERN OF THE NAUTILUS ALL AROUND US THIS FREEZE IS GAINING FAST HOW LONG I ASKED WILL THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR TANKS ENABLE US TO BREATHE ON BOARD THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
A FEW WHIFFS OF AIR HAD ENTERED MY LUNGS HAD WE RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES HAD WE CLEARED THE ICE BANK NO NED AND CONSEIL MY TWO GALLANT FRIENDS WERE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO SAVE ME
THE INJECTIONS COULDN'T GET IT TO GO A SINGLE DEGREE HIGHER
ATOM FOR THE NAUTILUS WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I FELT HALF SUFFOCATED WHAT A NIGHT I'M UNABLE TO DEPICT IT SUCH SUFFERINGS ARE INDESCRIBABLE THE NEXT DAY I WAS SHORT WINDED
AND HE DECIDED TO CRUSH THIS LAYER THE MAN HAD KEPT HIS ENERGY AND COMPOSURE HE HAD SUBDUED PHYSICAL PAIN WITH MORAL STRENGTH HE COULD STILL THINK PLAN AND ACT AT HIS ORDERS THE CRAFT WAS EASED OFF
IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY SIXTH WE HAD LIVED OFF THE SHIP'S STORES FOR FIVE DAYS AND ALL REMAINING BREATHABLE AIR HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN EVEN TODAY AS I WRITE THESE LINES MY SENSATIONS ARE SO INTENSE
I KNOW HE TOLD ME IN THAT CALM TONE THE MOST DREADFUL OUTLOOK COULDN'T CHANGE IT'S ONE MORE DANGER BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY WAY OF WARDING IT OFF OUR SOLE CHANCE FOR SALVATION
BUT THEY'LL SUPPLY AIR FOR ONLY TWO DAYS NOW THEN WE'VE BEEN BURIED BENEATH THE WATERS FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AND THE NAUTILUS'S HEAVY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY NEEDS RENEWING IN ANOTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS OUR RESERVE AIR WILL BE USED UP
AND SHAKE THEM CONTINUALLY BUT THIS SUBSTANCE WAS MISSING ON BOARD AND NOTHING ELSE COULD REPLACE IT
AFTER TWELVE HOURS HAD GONE BY WE HAD REMOVED FROM THE OUTLINED SURFACE AREA A SLICE OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK HENCE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CUBIC METERS ASSUMING THE SAME WORK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED EVERY TWELVE HOURS
THE ICE CRACKED WITH AN ODD RIPPING SOUND LIKE PAPER TEARING AND THE NAUTILUS BEGAN SETTLING DOWNWARD WE'RE GOING THROUGH CONSEIL MUTTERED IN MY EAR I COULDN'T ANSWER HIM I CLUTCHED HIS HAND
DIDN'T PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
YES I REPLIED BECAUSE WE'RE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN AND HERE THE SUN IS DUE NORTH SURE NED LAND WENT ON BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER WE'LL MAKE FOR THE ATLANTIC OR THE PACIFIC
WHICH WAS PROMPTLY ACCEPTED THE CANADIAN GOT INTO HIS UNDERWATER COSTUME AND WAS READY AS SOON AS HIS FELLOW WORKERS
SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CUBIC METERS TO DIG A HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE SHIP COULD DESCEND BELOW THIS TRACT OF ICE WORK BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AND WAS CARRIED ON WITH TIRELESS TENACITY INSTEAD OF DIGGING ALL AROUND THE NAUTILUS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENTAILED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES
BULB BEARING SEAWEED OF WHICH THE OPEN SEA AT THE POLE HAD REVEALED A FEW SPECIMENS WITH THEIR SMOOTH VISCOUS FILAMENTS THEY MEASURED AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED METERS LONG GENUINE CABLES MORE THAN AN INCH THICK AND VERY TOUGH
WE LISTENED WE FORGOT OUR SUFFERINGS WE HOPED ONCE MORE WE HAD STAKED OUR SALVATION ON THIS ONE LAST GAMBLE DESPITE THE BUZZING IN MY HEAD I SOON COULD HEAR VIBRATIONS UNDER THE NAUTILUS'S HULL WE TILTED
AND YET NOBODY PROLONGED HIS UNDERWATER WORK BEYOND THE TIME ALLOTTED HIM HIS SHIFT OVER EACH MAN SURRENDERED TO A GASPING COMPANION THE AIR TANK THAT WOULD REVIVE HIM
THE AIR COULDN'T BE RENEWED IN THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR ACCORDINGLY THAT DAY IT KEPT GETTING WORSE AN UNBEARABLE HEAVINESS WEIGHED ME DOWN NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THIS AGONIZING SENSATION AFFECTED ME TO AN INTENSE DEGREE
WHEN I NOTED THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SIDE WALLS WERE CLOSING IN ON EACH OTHER THE LIQUID STRATA FARTHEST FROM THE TRENCH NOT WARMED BY THE MOVEMENTS OF WORKMEN AND TOOLS WERE SHOWING A TENDENCY TO SOLIDIFY IN THE FACE OF THIS IMMINENT NEW DANGER
HAD HE PERISHED HAD HIS COMPANIONS DIED WITH HIM
AND THE NAUTILUS'S ATMOSPHERE WHICH WAS ALREADY CHARGED WITH CARBON DIOXIDE THE AIR HADN'T BEEN RENEWED IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND ITS LIFE GIVING QUALITIES WERE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED MEANWHILE
AND YOU MY GALLANT CONSEIL YOU SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL NOT TOO MUCH TO BE CANDID WITH MASTER I WAS LACKING A FEW THROATFULS OF AIR BUT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BY
FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON HOW I GOT ONTO THE PLATFORM I'M UNABLE TO SAY PERHAPS THE CANADIAN TRANSFERRED ME THERE BUT I COULD BREATHE I COULD INHALE THE LIFE GIVING SEA AIR
THERE ARE STILL IN THIS COUNTRY LARGE BODIES OF PERSONS BY WHOSE NOTIONS OF MORALITY AND RELIGION THESE RECREATIONS ARE CONDEMNED AND THOSE PERSONS BELONGING CHIEFLY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS
THE PEOPLE OF ONE ENGLISH COLONY AND OF NEARLY HALF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN INTERDICTED BY LAW FROM MAKING ANY USE WHATEVER OF FERMENTED DRINKS
THERE ARE FEW ACTS WHICH CHRISTIANS AND EUROPEANS REGARD WITH MORE UNAFFECTED DISGUST THAN MUSSULMANS REGARD THIS PARTICULAR MODE OF SATISFYING HUNGER IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE AN OFFENCE AGAINST THEIR RELIGION
BUT WITHOUT DWELLING UPON SUPPOSITITIOUS CASES THERE ARE IN OUR OWN DAY GROSS USURPATIONS UPON THE LIBERTY OF PRIVATE LIFE ACTUALLY PRACTISED AND STILL GREATER ONES THREATENED WITH SOME EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS
THAT THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH ARE STRICTLY INSEPARABLE FROM THE UNFAVOURABLE JUDGMENT OF OTHERS ARE THE ONLY ONES TO WHICH A PERSON SHOULD EVER BE SUBJECTED FOR THAT PORTION OF HIS CONDUCT AND CHARACTER WHICH CONCERNS HIS OWN GOOD
A THEORY OF SOCIAL RIGHTS THE LIKE OF WHICH PROBABLY NEVER BEFORE FOUND ITS WAY INTO DISTINCT LANGUAGE BEING NOTHING SHORT OF THIS THAT IT IS THE ABSOLUTE SOCIAL RIGHT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL
THAT IS OF AN OVERRULING MAJORITY THOUGH OFTEN WRONG IS LIKELY TO BE STILL OFTENER RIGHT BECAUSE ON SUCH QUESTIONS THEY ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO JUDGE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH SOME MODE OF CONDUCT IF ALLOWED TO BE PRACTISED WOULD AFFECT THEMSELVES
TO AGITATE FOR A SIMILAR LAW IN THIS COUNTRY THE ASSOCIATION OR ALLIANCE AS IT TERMS ITSELF WHICH HAS BEEN FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS ACQUIRED SOME NOTORIETY
BUT ON THAT OF THE BUYER AND CONSUMER SINCE THE STATE MIGHT JUST AS WELL FORBID HIM TO DRINK WINE AS PURPOSELY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBTAIN IT THE SECRETARY HOWEVER SAYS
THEY SHOULD BE FOR EVER STIMULATING EACH OTHER TO INCREASED EXERCISE OF THEIR HIGHER FACULTIES AND INCREASED DIRECTION OF THEIR FEELINGS AND AIMS TOWARDS WISE INSTEAD OF FOOLISH ELEVATING INSTEAD OF DEGRADING OBJECTS AND CONTEMPLATIONS
EVERY ONE WHO RECEIVES THE PROTECTION OF SOCIETY OWES A RETURN FOR THE BENEFIT AND THE FACT OF LIVING IN SOCIETY RENDERS IT INDISPENSABLE THAT EACH SHOULD BE BOUND TO OBSERVE A CERTAIN LINE OF CONDUCT TOWARDS THE REST THIS CONDUCT CONSISTS FIRST
BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE BY NO MEANS EXPLAINS EITHER THE DEGREE OR THE KIND OF THEIR REPUGNANCE FOR WINE ALSO IS FORBIDDEN BY THEIR RELIGION AND TO PARTAKE OF IT IS BY ALL MUSSULMANS ACCOUNTED WRONG BUT NOT DISGUSTING
NO MORE THAN BETWEEN THE DESIRE OF A THIEF TO TAKE A PURSE AND THE DESIRE OF THE RIGHT OWNER TO KEEP IT AND A PERSON'S TASTE IS AS MUCH HIS OWN PECULIAR CONCERN AS HIS OPINION OR HIS PURSE
THERE MUST BE SOME LENGTH OF TIME AND AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE AFTER WHICH A MORAL OR PRUDENTIAL TRUTH MAY BE REGARDED AS ESTABLISHED AND IT IS MERELY DESIRED TO PREVENT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION FROM FALLING OVER THE SAME PRECIPICE
IF ANYTHING INVADES MY SOCIAL RIGHTS CERTAINLY THE TRAFFIC IN STRONG DRINK DOES IT DESTROYS MY PRIMARY RIGHT OF SECURITY BY CONSTANTLY CREATING AND STIMULATING SOCIAL DISORDER IT INVADES MY RIGHT OF EQUALITY
THAT THEY WERE FORCIBLY EXPELLED IN A BODY FROM THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FIRST GREW UP WHILE NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CHASED INTO A SOLITARY RECESS IN THE MIDST OF A DESERT MANY IN THIS COUNTRY OPENLY DECLARE THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT ONLY THAT IT IS NOT CONVENIENT
AND THAT NO ONE OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED THROUGH PIECEWORK OR OTHERWISE TO EARN BY SUPERIOR SKILL OR INDUSTRY MORE THAN OTHERS CAN WITHOUT IT AND THEY EMPLOY A MORAL POLICE WHICH OCCASIONALLY BECOMES A PHYSICAL ONE TO DETER SKILFUL WORKMEN FROM RECEIVING
AND HAS BEEN MADE THE FOUNDATION OF A SOCIETY IN THE AGE OF NEWSPAPERS RAILWAYS AND THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH WHAT HERE CONCERNS US IS
THE NOTION THAT IT IS ONE MAN'S DUTY THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE RELIGIOUS
IT IS A DIRECT INFRACTION OF THAT PRINCIPLE BEING A MERE RIVETING OF THE CHAINS OF ONE HALF OF THE COMMUNITY AND AN EMANCIPATION OF THE OTHER FROM RECIPROCITY OF OBLIGATION TOWARDS THEM
IN ORDER THAT PEOPLE MAY KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO EXPECT BUT IN EACH PERSON'S OWN CONCERNS HIS INDIVIDUAL SPONTANEITY IS ENTITLED TO FREE EXERCISE CONSIDERATIONS TO AID HIS JUDGMENT EXHORTATIONS TO STRENGTHEN HIS WILL MAY BE OFFERED TO HIM
THERE ARE MANY WHO CONSIDER AS AN INJURY TO THEMSELVES ANY CONDUCT WHICH THEY HAVE A DISTASTE FOR AND RESENT IT AS AN OUTRAGE TO THEIR FEELINGS AS A RELIGIOUS BIGOT WHEN CHARGED WITH DISREGARDING THE RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF OTHERS
DISSIMULATION AND INSINCERITY IRASCIBILITY ON INSUFFICIENT CAUSE AND RESENTMENT DISPROPORTIONED TO THE PROVOCATION THE LOVE OF DOMINEERING OVER OTHERS THE DESIRE TO ENGROSS MORE THAN ONE'S SHARE OF ADVANTAGES
AND USUALLY DIMINISHES BY A GREATER OR LESS AMOUNT THE GENERAL RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY IF HE DETERIORATES HIS BODILY OR MENTAL FACULTIES HE NOT ONLY BRINGS EVIL UPON ALL WHO DEPENDED ON HIM FOR ANY PORTION OF THEIR HAPPINESS
IT HAS HAD THE WHOLE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD
THOUGH THE PHRASE IS NOT UNOBJECTIONABLE LOWNESS OR DEPRAVATION OF TASTE
IF PROTECTION AGAINST THEMSELVES IS CONFESSEDLY DUE TO CHILDREN AND PERSONS UNDER AGE
AND I DO NOT SEE HOW THOSE WHO BELIEVE THIS CAN THINK OTHERWISE THAN THAT THE EXAMPLE ON THE WHOLE MUST BE MORE SALUTARY THAN HURTFUL SINCE IF IT DISPLAYS THE MISCONDUCT
IN SOME OF HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES UNHAPPILY ARE AMONG THOSE WHO FIGURE IN POLITICAL LIFE THE ORGAN OF THE ALLIANCE WHO WOULD DEEPLY DEPLORE THE RECOGNITION OF ANY PRINCIPLE WHICH COULD BE WRESTED TO JUSTIFY BIGOTRY AND PERSECUTION
UNDERTAKES TO POINT OUT THE BROAD AND IMPASSABLE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDES SUCH PRINCIPLES FROM THOSE OF THE ASSOCIATION ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THOUGHT OPINION CONSCIENCE APPEAR TO ME HE SAYS TO BE WITHOUT THE SPHERE OF LEGISLATION
AND ITS BEST EFFORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN INDIVIDUAL CASES ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL ONES BUT IT IS PERFECTLY WELL ABLE TO MAKE THE RISING GENERATION AS A WHOLE AS GOOD AS AND A LITTLE BETTER THAN ITSELF
WERE VERY FAIR TO VIEW NEVERTHELESS ALTHOUGH NONE OF US NOT EVEN UNCLE ROGER OR FELICITY SAID A WORD AT THE TIME FOR FEAR OF HURTING THE STORY GIRL'S FEELINGS THE PUDDING DID NOT TASTE EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD IT WAS TOUGH DECIDEDLY TOUGH
YET BLIGHTED AFFECTION REPRESSES MY SMILE ABROAD THE WILD FURY OF WINTER IS LOWERING AND LEAFLESS AND DREAR IS THE TREE BUT THE VERTICAL SUN OF THE SOUTH APPEARS POURING ITS FIERCE KILLING HEATS UPON ME
WAS SAID BY THE GENTLEMAN HE UTTERED A THOUSAND THINGS THAT DELIGHTED HIS COMPANION
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WERE ANY NEEDLES IN THAT SAWDUST MOTHER SIFTED IT VERY CAREFULLY I KNOW A STORY ABOUT A MAN WHOSE SON SWALLOWED A MOUSE SAID THE STORY GIRL WHO WOULD PROBABLY HAVE KNOWN A STORY AND TRIED TO TELL IT
HE GROANED AND TWISTED AND DOUBLED HIMSELF UP BUT HE OVERDID IT HE WAS NOT AS GOOD AN ACTOR AS THE STORY GIRL FELICITY LOOKED SCORNFULLY AT HIM UNCLE ROGER YOU ARE NOT ONE BIT SICK SHE SAID DELIBERATELY YOU ARE JUST PUTTING ON
THE CHILLING WHITE OF HER COMPLEXION WAS STRONGLY CONTRASTED WITH EYES OF THE DEEPEST BLACK THAT WERE FIXED IN ROOTED ATTENTION ON A PICTURE SHE HELD IN HER HAND FRANCES HARDLY BREATHED AS SHE WAS ENABLED BY A MOVEMENT OF ISABELLA
AND LEFT THE SECONDARY PREPARATION OF THE REGULAR MEALS TO CECILY AND THE STORY GIRL IT WAS AGREED THAT THE LATTER WAS TO MAKE A CORNMEAL PUDDING FOR DINNER IN SPITE OF HER DISASTER WITH THE BREAD
ISABELLA MOVED FROM THE WINDOW AS HER LAST TONES MELTED ON THE EAR OF HER ADMIRING LISTENER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HER EYE RESTED ON THE PALLID FACE OF THE INTRUDER A GLOW OF FIRE LIGHTED THE COUNTENANCE OF BOTH AT THE SAME INSTANT
A WARM HEARTED FEMALE CAN MAKE IN LOVE IN THE SHORT SPACE OF HALF AN HOUR PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE IS A PREDISPOSITION TO THE DISTEMPER SARAH FOUND THE CONVERSATION WHEN IT BEGAN TO TOUCH ON FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY TOO INTERESTING TO VENTURE HER VOICE WITH A REPLY
AS THE STORY GIRL PROUDLY INFORMED US WHEN WE CAME TO THE DINNER TABLE ALL ON HER OWN HOOK SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF IT AND CERTAINLY AS FAR AS APPEARANCE WENT IT JUSTIFIED HER TRIUMPH THE SLICES WERE SMOOTH AND GOLDEN
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A HORRIBLE FEAR WHICH FLASHED INTO HER MIND THAT POSSIBLY SAWDUST PUDDINGS WERE NOT HEALTHY FOR PEOPLE TO EAT
DO YOU KNOW DUNWOODIE HAVE YOU SEEN HIM OFTEN ONCE MORE FRANCES VENTURED TO LOOK HER GUEST IN THE FACE AND AGAIN SHE MET THE PIERCING EYES BENT ON HER AS IF TO SEARCH HER INMOST HEART SPEAK MISS WHARTON IS MAJOR DUNWOODIE KNOWN TO YOU
AND SHE ROSE AND MOVED TO A WINDOW OF HER APARTMENT
THIS SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE WEATHER AND PERHAPS THE SITUATION OF MY BROTHER HAVE UNITED TO MAKE ME MELANCHOLY MISS WHARTON SAID ISABELLA IN A LOW TONE AND IN A VOICE THAT TREMBLED AS SHE SPOKE
THE WEATHER WHICH HAD BEEN MILD AND CLEAR SINCE THE STORM NOW CHANGED WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF THE AMERICAN CLIMATE TOWARDS EVENING THE COLD BLASTS POURED DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND FLURRIES OF SNOW PLAINLY INDICATED THAT THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER HAD ARRIVED
AND IF EVER ONE OF YOU MENTIONS SAWDUST PUDDING TO ME I'LL NEVER TELL YOU ANOTHER STORY AS LONG AS I LIVE THE THREAT WAS EFFECTUAL NEVER DID WE MENTION THAT UNHOLY PUDDING
AND WHICH FOLLOWED EACH OTHER OVER HER CHEEK AT SUCH INTERVALS AS SEEMED TO PRONOUNCE THE GRIEF TOO HEAVY TO ADMIT OF
THERE WAS A PLAINTIVE EARNESTNESS IN THE VOICE OF MISS SINGLETON THAT DISARMED FRANCES OF ALL RESENTMENT AND THE ONLY ANSWER SHE COULD MAKE WAS TO HIDE HER BURNING FACE BETWEEN HER HANDS AS SHE SANK BACK IN A CHAIR TO CONCEAL HER CONFUSION
WOULD MORE THAN REPAY THE PAIN OF A MORTIFIED SPIRIT AND WOUNDED BODY ADDED THE COLONEL IN A MANNER OF PECULIAR SOFTNESS I HOPE THE LATTER IS BUT TRIFLING SAID SARAH
TRIFLING INDEED COMPARED TO THE FORMER RETURNED THE COLONEL IN THE SAME MANNER AH MISS WHARTON IT IS IN SUCH MOMENTS THAT WE FEEL THE FULL VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER TRIED IT CANNOT EASILY IMAGINE WHAT A RAPID PROGRESS
TIS THOUGHT YOU HAVE LITTLE TO APPREHEND FOR YOUR BROTHER SAID FRANCES IN THE SAME EMBARRASSED MANNER HAD YOU SEEN HIM WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT IN BY MAJOR DUNWOODIE FRANCES PAUSED WITH A FEELING OF CONSCIOUS SHAME
THE STORY GIRL HAD BEEN TAKING COOKING LESSONS FROM FELICITY ALL THE WEEK AND GETTING ON TOLERABLY WELL ALTHOUGH MINDFUL OF HER FORMER MISTAKE SHE NEVER VENTURED ON ANYTHING WITHOUT FELICITY'S APPROVAL BUT FELICITY HAD NO TIME TO OVERSEE HER THIS MORNING
NOTWITHSTANDING SEVERAL OF THE SMALL GAME HAD NESTLED IN THE POCKET OF CAPTAIN LAWTON'S MAN AND EVEN THE ASSISTANT OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES HAD CALCULATED THE UNCERTAINTY OF HIS REMAINING LONG IN SUCH GOOD QUARTERS
STILL THERE WAS MORE LEFT UNCONSUMED THAN THE PRUDENT MISS PEYTON KNEW HOW TO DISPOSE OF TO ADVANTAGE CAESAR AND HIS MISTRESS HAD THEREFORE A LONG AND CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION ON THIS IMPORTANT BUSINESS AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE IT LOOKED JUST LIKE CORNMEAL SAID THE STORY GIRL GOING FROM WHITE TO RED IN HER SHAME WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE UP TRYING TO COOK AND STICK TO THINGS I CAN DO
AND FRANCES MOVED TOWARDS IT WITH THE BENEVOLENT INTENTION OF ASCERTAINING THE SITUATION OF HER GUEST WHEN THE SURPRISED GIRL SAW HER WHOM SHE HAD THOUGHT TO BE SLEEPING NOT ONLY AWAKE BUT EMPLOYED IN A MANNER
LONG HAS THE STORM POURED ITS WEIGHT ON MY NATION AND LONG HAVE HER BRAVES STOOD THE SHOCK LONG HAS HER CHIEFTAIN ENNOBLED HIS STATION A BULWARK ON LIBERTY'S ROCK UNLICENSED AMBITION RELAXES ITS TOIL
TELL HIM TO SWALLOW A CAT ROARED THE POOR DOCTOR AND SLAMMED HIS DOOR NOW IF UNCLE ROGER HAS SWALLOWED ANY NEEDLES MAYBE IT WOULD MAKE IT ALL RIGHT IF HE SWALLOWED A PINCUSHION
I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT THESE SHARP PAINS I'VE BEEN FEELING EVER SINCE DINNER MEANT I KNOW NOW I MUST HAVE SWALLOWED A NEEDLE SEVERAL NEEDLES PERHAPS I'M DONE FOR
FELICITY AND CECILY STARED BLANKLY AT THE STORY GIRL WE BOYS BEGAN TO LAUGH BUT WERE CHECKED MIDWAY BY UNCLE ROGER HE WAS ROCKING HIMSELF BACK AND FORTH WITH HIS HAND PRESSED AGAINST HIS STOMACH OH HE GROANED
MANICAMP MADE A FACE IN THAT CASE GIVE ME THE RECOMMENDATION BACK AGAIN WHAT TO DO TO ADD TWO WORDS TO IT TWO WORDS YES TWO WORDS ONLY WHAT ARE THEY IN HASTE
AS A STATEMENT OF ITS JUST PRICE ONE FINGER LESS THAN THE MERCHANT HELD UP WHATEVER HIS NUMBER MIGHT BE NOW MISTER CRUNCHER SAID MISS PROSS WHOSE EYES WERE RED WITH FELICITY IF YOU ARE READY I AM JERRY HOARSELY PROFESSED HIMSELF AT MISS PROSS'S SERVICE
I THINK NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE WHEN OBLIGING A FRIEND YOU ARE QUITE HEROIC WHERE ARE THE TWENTY PISTOLES HERE THEY ARE SAID MALICORNE SHOWING THEM THAT'S WELL
I FEAR NOT YET IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR CHARLES YET
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD QUIETLY LISTEN MONTALAIS SAID HE WITHOUT HEEDING WHETHER THAT FAMILIARITY PLEASED HIS MISTRESS OR NOT LET US NOT DISPUTE ABOUT IT AND WHY NOT BECAUSE DURING THE YEAR WHICH I HAVE KNOWN YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD ME TURNED OUT OF DOORS TWENTY TIMES IF I DID NOT PLEASE YOU
FOR THE REST A JOYOUS BEAM OF THE SUN FOR THE SUN APPEARED TO CARE LITTLE FOR THE LOSS FRANCE HAD JUST SUFFERED A SUNBEAM WE SAY DESCENDED UPON THEM DRAWING PERFUMES FROM THE NEIGHBORING FLOWERS AND ANIMATING THE WALLS THEMSELVES
AY BUT WHEN WHEN YOU LIKE WHERE IS IT THEN IN MY POCKET HOW IN YOUR POCKET YES AND WITH A SMILE MALICORNE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A LETTER UPON WHICH MADEMOISELLE SEIZED AS A PREY AND WHICH SHE READ EAGERLY

HE TOOK THE LAMP IN HIS HAND
WITH A MIEN SOMETIMES LIVELY AND SOMETIMES DULL MAKING GOOD USE OF TWO LARGE EYES SHADED WITH LONG EYE LASHES WAS SHORT OF STATURE AND SWART OF SKIN HE SMILED WITH AN ENORMOUS BUT WELL FURNISHED MOUTH AND HIS POINTED CHIN WHICH APPEARED TO ENJOY A MOBILITY

MOVED AFTER THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN PUT THE LAMP DOWN AND CONFRONTING THE SPEAKER AND TAKING HIM NOT UNGENTLY BY THE LOOSE FRONT OF HIS RED WOOLLEN SHIRT SAID YOU KNOW HIM YOU HAVE SAID DO YOU KNOW ME YES I KNOW YOU CITIZEN DOCTOR
AND WHAT DO YOU DESIRE MONSIEUR DEMON THAT I SHOULD LOSE MY SOUL FROM ANGER MALICORNE WAS ROLLING HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY BETWEEN HIS FINGERS BUT ALL AT ONCE HE LET FALL HIS HAT SEIZED THE YOUNG GIRL BY THE SHOULDERS PULLED HER TOWARDS HIM AND SEALED HER MOUTH WITH TWO LIPS THAT WERE VERY WARM
AURE WOULD HAVE CRIED OUT BUT THE CRY WAS STIFLED IN HIS KISS NERVOUS AND APPARENTLY ANGRY THE YOUNG GIRL PUSHED MALICORNE AGAINST THE WALL GOOD SAID MALICORNE PHILOSOPHICALLY THAT'S ENOUGH FOR SIX WEEKS ADIEU MADEMOISELLE ACCEPT MY VERY HUMBLE SALUTATION

EVERY DAY SHARED THE FATE FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN CLUTCHED THAT HER HEART COULD NOT BE AS LIGHTENED OF ITS LOAD AS SHE FELT IT OUGHT TO BE THE SHADOWS OF THE WINTRY AFTERNOON WERE BEGINNING TO FALL AND EVEN NOW THE DREADFUL CARTS WERE ROLLING THROUGH THE STREETS

AS SOME FANCIED APPEARANCE INDUCED HIM TO BELIEVE IT TOO PUBLIC FOR HIS PURPOSE AT LENGTH HE STOPPED IN FRONT OF ONE MORE HUMBLE IN APPEARANCE AND MORE DIRTY THAN ANY HE HAD YET SEEN AND HAVING CROSSED OVER AND SURVEYED IT
AUNT JANE UNCLE PARKER HAVING NO AUTHORITY WHATEVER FOR ANY SUCH DESIGNATIONS BUT PARTICULARLY THE LAST TO WHICH AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE HE STUCK WITH GREAT OBSTINACY
FAGIN APPEARED TO RECEIVE THIS COMMUNICATION WITH GREAT INTEREST MOUNTING A STOOL HE CAUTIOUSLY APPLIED HIS EYE TO THE PANE OF GLASS FROM WHICH SECRET POST HE COULD SEE MISTER CLAYPOLE

HALF A DOZEN TIMES IN A YEAR AND THEN ONLY AS SOME SERVANT'S DEPUTY BUT ALSO THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE HOUSE'S RETAINERS AND OWED VASSALAGE TO IT AND WAS BOUND TO LEAL AND LOYAL INTEREST IN IT FOR THIS REASON
AND IF WE COULD ONLY GET IN WITH SOME GENTLEMAN OF THIS SORT I SAY IT WOULD BE CHEAP AT THAT TWENTY POUND NOTE YOU'VE GOT ESPECIALLY AS WE DON'T VERY WELL KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF IT OURSELVES AFTER EXPRESSING THIS OPINION
WHICH HAD BEEN EXPOSED FOR THE DAY'S SALE HE HAD TAKEN A TIN BOX FROM UNDER HIS STOOL TO PRODUCE A RELAY OF THOSE DREADFUL SPECIMENS AND WAS GOING TO LOOK IN AT THE LID WHEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF PAUSING OH HERE YOU ARE AGAIN
SHELTERLESS FRAGMENTS OF STRAW AND PAPER GOT UP REVOLVING STORMS THERE WHEN THE MAIN STREET WAS AT PEACE AND THE WATER CART AS IF IT WERE DRUNK OR SHORT SIGHTED CAME BLUNDERING AND JOLTING ROUND IT
OR A HOUSE OR A MAIL COACH OR A BANK IF HE DRINKS IT REGULARLY MISTER CLAYPOLE NO SOONER HEARD THIS EXTRACT FROM HIS OWN REMARKS THAN HE FELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED FROM THE JEW TO CHARLOTTE
IN A VERY FRIENDLY MANNER GOOD STUFF THAT OBSERVED MISTER CLAYPOLE SMACKING HIS LIPS DEAR SAID FAGIN A MAN NEED BE ALWAYS EMPTYING A TILL OR A POCKET OR A WOMAN'S RETICULE
HAS THE VERY BEST SOCIETY IN THE PROFESSION REGULAR TOWN MADERS ASKED MISTER CLAYPOLE NOT A COUNTRYMAN AMONG EM AND I DON'T THINK HE'D TAKE YOU EVEN ON MY RECOMMENDATION IF HE DIDN'T RUN RATHER SHORT OF ASSISTANTS JUST NOW

INTO NO EXPLANATION OF HIS MOTIVES AND THEY WALKED ON VERY LOVINGLY TOGETHER IN PURSUANCE OF THIS CAUTIOUS PLAN MISTER CLAYPOLE WENT ON WITHOUT HALTING UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE ANGEL
SAID NOAH BARNEY COMPLIED BY USHERING THEM INTO A SMALL BACK ROOM AND SETTING THE REQUIRED VIANDS BEFORE THEM HAVING DONE WHICH HE INFORMED THE TRAVELLERS THAT THEY COULD BE LODGED THAT NIGHT
DO YOU REMEMBER ME THEN ASKED HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE STOPPING IN HIS AMBLE ONE SIDED BEFORE THE STALL AND SPEAKING IN A POUNDING WAY THOUGH WITH GREAT GOOD HUMOUR
R THREE WHAT CRIPPLES SAID CHARLOTTE THREE CRIPPLES REPEATED NOAH AND A VERY GOOD SIGN TOO NOW THEN KEEP CLOSE AT MY HEELS AND COME ALONG
IT WAS VERY LUCKY IT WAS ONLY ME I DIDN'T TAKE IT STAMMERED NOAH NO LONGER STRETCHING OUT HIS LEGS LIKE AN INDEPENDENT GENTLEMAN BUT COILING THEM UP AS WELL AS HE COULD UNDER HIS CHAIR IT WAS ALL HER DOING
HE SALUTED ALL HIS REGULAR PASSERS BY EVERY DAY AS HE SAT ON HIS STOOL BACKED UP BY THE LAMP POST AND ON THE ADAPTABLE CHARACTER OF THESE SALUTES HE GREATLY PLUMED HIMSELF THUS TO THE RECTOR HE ADDRESSED A BOW COMPOUNDED OF LAY DEFERENCE
YOU UNDERSTAND OH YES I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY REPLIED FAGIN TELLING THE TRUTH FOR ONCE GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT
AND I SUPPOSE NOW THAT YOU KNOW OF IT YOU'LL BE THERE GOD BLESS ME EXCLAIMED MISTER QUARTERPAGE YOU'VE REALLY DONE THAT WELL WELL SO WE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AT LAST AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
IT STRIKES ME WE'VE FOUND A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN WE EVER BARGAINED FOR HE EXCLAIMED DIDN'T AYLMORE SAY THAT THE REAL CULPRIT AT CLOUDHAMPTON WAS ANOTHER MAN HIS CLERK OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT HE DID AGREED BRETON HE INSISTS ON IT THEN THIS FELLOW CHAMBERLAYNE MUST HAVE BEEN THE MAN SAID SPARGO HE CAME TO MARKET MILCASTER FROM THE NORTH
EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS QUIET AS THE DEAD FOLK WHO LAY BENEATH THEIR FEET
A GREAT DEAL YOU SAID IF WE FOUND THAT COFFIN EMPTY IT IS EMPTY COME ON QUICK ALL RIGHT I BELIEVE I KNOW WHERE ELPHICK AND CARDLESTONE CAN BE FOUND THAT'S ALL ALL IT'S ENOUGH
WE HAVE TO BE UP AT DAYBREAK AND POSSIBLY YOU TOO WOULD LIKE TO BE UP JUST AS EARLY MISTER QUARTERPAGE LOOKED AN ENQUIRY OVER THE TOP OF A DECANTER WHICH HE WAS HANDLING AT DAYBREAK HE EXCLAIMED THE FACT IS SAID SPARGO THAT GRAVE OF CHAMBERLAYNE'S IS GOING TO BE OPENED AT DAYBREAK
THEY COULD ALL READ THE LETTERING ON IT JAMES CARTWRIGHT CHAMBERLAYNE BORN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO DIED EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE SPARGO TURNED AWAY AS THE MEN BEGAN TO LIFT THE COFFIN OUT OF THE GRAVE WE SHALL KNOW NOW HE WHISPERED TO BRETON AND YET
NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM BUT THAT THE TWO SHOULD GO IN HIS FAMILY HE SAID HAD JUST RETIRED BUT HE HIMSELF WAS GOING TO TAKE A FINAL NIGHTCAP AND A CIGAR AND THEY MUST SHARE IT FOR A FEW MINUTES ONLY THEN MISTER QUARTERPAGE SAID SPARGO AS THEY FOLLOWED THE OLD MAN INTO HIS DINING ROOM
SPARGO CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF NAMES THAT WERE FAMILIAR TO HIM MISTER QUARTERPAGE'S AMONGST THEM
IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY REACHED THE LITTLE TOWN BUT SPARGO HAVING LOOKED IN AT THE PARLOUR OF THE YELLOW DRAGON AND ASCERTAINED THAT MISTER QUARTERPAGE HAD ONLY JUST GONE HOME TOOK BRETON ACROSS THE STREET
AND THAT THE BODY OF THE STOCKBROKER CHAMBERLAYNE THEN A GOOD DEAL OF HIS SPARGO'S LATEST THEORY WOULD BE DISSOLVED TO NOTHINGNESS BUT IF THAT COFFIN CONTAINED NO BODY AT ALL THEN THEY'RE DOWN TO IT WHISPERED BRETON PRESENTLY THEY ALL WENT AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE GRAVE
WHAT IS IT WE SHALL KNOW IF IF WHAT SAID BRETON IF WHAT BUT SPARGO SHOOK HIS HEAD
IN UPON THE DEAD HE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS DONE THE MEN EMPLOYED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES INSTRUCTED OVER NIGHT HAD FENCED IN THE GRAVE WITH CANVAS THE PROCEEDINGS WERE ACCORDINGLY CONDUCTED IN STRICT PRIVACY A MAN WAS POSTED TO KEEP AWAY
ONE OF THEM EVIDENTLY DESIROUS OF MAKING SURE THAT NO BODY WAS IN THE COFFIN THRUST DOWN HIS FINGERS AT VARIOUS PLACES ALONG ITS LENGTH HE TOO LAUGHED THE COFFIN'S WEIGHTED WITH LEAD HE REMARKED SEE AND TEARING THE SAWDUST ASIDE HE SHOWED THOSE AROUND HIM THAT
ONE OF THEM WAS BRUSHING THE EARTH AWAY FROM THE NAME PLATE
HIM WITH A SMILE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE GOOD GROUNDS FOR SUSPICION HE REMARKED HERE IS NO DEAD BODY GENTLEMEN SEE IF ANYTHING LIES BENEATH THE SAWDUST HE ADDED TURNING TO THE WORKMEN TURN IT OUT THE WORKMEN BEGAN TO SCOOP OUT THE SAWDUST WITH THEIR HANDS
AT FIRST THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT AND SPARGO OCCUPIED HIMSELF BY REFLECTING THAT EVERY SPADEFUL OF EARTH THROWN OUT OF THAT GRAVE WAS BRINGING HIM NEARER TO THE TRUTH HE HAD AN UNCONQUERABLE INTUITION THAT THE TRUTH
MARKET MILCASTER AND THE SEA WAS WHITE WITH FOG
FORCED HIS WAY TO WHERE THE OFFICIALS FROM THE HOME OFFICE AND THE SOLICITOR SENT BY THE WATCHMAN WERE HASTILY EXAMINING THEIR DISCOVERIES THE FIRST BUNDLE OF PAPERS OPENED EVIDENTLY RELATED TO TRANSACTIONS AT MARKET MILCASTER
BUT WELL TO YOUR POOR FATHER HE WAS LED AWAY SIR LED AWAY BY CHAMBERLAYNE GOD BLESS ME WHAT A NIGHT OF SURPRISES WHY MISTER SPARGO SUPPOSING THAT COFFIN IS FOUND EMPTY WHAT THEN THEN ANSWERED SPARGO THEN I THINK WE SHALL
LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE COFFIN
AND THE ISSUES WERE TREMENDOUS NOW FOR IT SAID THE WATCHMAN'S SOLICITOR IN AN UNDERTONE
DONE IT CLEVERLY HE REMARKED LOOKING ROUND YOU SEE HOW THESE WEIGHTS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED WHEN A BODY'S LAID OUT IN A COFFIN YOU KNOW ALL THE WEIGHT'S IN THE END WHERE THE HEAD AND TRUNK REST HERE YOU SEE THE HEAVIEST BAR OF LEAD IS IN THE MIDDLE THE LIGHTEST AT THE FEET CLEVER
A QUANTITY OF PAPERS RELATING TO CLOUDHAMPTON AND THE HEARTH AND HOME MUTUAL BENEFIT SOCIETY WERE REVEALED HE GAVE A HASTY GLANCE AT THESE AND DREW BRETON ASIDE
AND THIS OTHER YOUNG GENTLEMAN SPARGO LOOKED AT BRETON WHO HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIM PERMISSION TO SPEAK MISTER QUARTERPAGE HE SAID THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN IS WITHOUT DOUBT JOHN MAITLAND'S SON HE'S THE YOUNG BARRISTER MISTER RONALD BRETON THAT I TOLD YOU OF BUT
WORKED THEM OUT IT SEEMED TO SPARGO THAT EACH MAN GREW SLOWER AND SLOWER IN HIS MOVEMENTS HE FELT THAT HE HIMSELF WAS GETTING FIDGETY THEN HE HEARD A VOICE OF AUTHORITY LIFT THE LID OFF A MAN AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN A MAN AT THE FOOT SUDDENLY AND SWIFTLY RAISED THE LID
DECANTER AND GLASS AND HASTENED TO GIVE BRETON HIS HAND MY DEAR YOUNG SIR HE EXCLAIMED THAT I WILL INDEED AND AS TO WISHING YOU WELL
BE ABLE TO PUT OUR HANDS ON THE MAN WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN IT YOU THINK MY FATHER WAS WORKED UPON BY THIS MAN CHAMBERLAYNE SIR OBSERVED BRETON A FEW MINUTES LATER WHEN THEY HAD ALL SAT DOWN ROUND MISTER QUARTERPAGE'S HOSPITABLE HEARTH
IT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ANY SURPRISE TO ME TO HEAR DEFINITELY I MEAN YOUNG GENTLEMEN THAT ALL THIS MONEY THAT WAS IN QUESTION WENT INTO CHAMBERLAYNE'S POCKETS
AND YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT CHAMBERLAYNE IS ACTUALLY ALIVE MISTER SPARGO SPARGO PULLED OUT HIS WATCH WE SHALL ALL KNOW WHETHER HE WAS BURIED IN THAT GRAVE BEFORE ANOTHER SIX HOURS ARE OVER MISTER QUARTERPAGE HE SAID HE MIGHT WELL HAVE SPOKEN OF FOUR HOURS INSTEAD OF SIX FOR IT WAS
CHAMBERLAYNE MY DEAR YOUNG SIR HE ANSWERED
RIGHT AWAY UP IN ONE OF THE WILDEST PARTS OF THE YORKSHIRE MOORS I EXPECT THEY'VE GONE THERE NOBODY KNOWS EVEN THEIR NAMES THERE
NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM UNTIL HE CAME TO THIS TOWN AND YET BEFORE HE HAD BEEN HERE VERY LONG HE HAD CONTRIVED TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH EVERYBODY OF COURSE TO HIS OWN ADVANTAGE
THE MEN GATHERED ROUND CRANED THEIR NECKS WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT SAWDUST THE COFFIN WAS PACKED TO THE BRIM WITH SAWDUST TIGHTLY PRESSED DOWN THE SURFACE LAY SMOOTH UNDISTURBED LEVELLED AS SOME HAND HAD LEVELLED IT LONG YEARS BEFORE
THE OFFICIALS IN CHARGE OF IT HAVE COME DOWN IN THE SAME TRAIN WITH US WE'RE ALL STAYING ACROSS THERE AT THE DRAGON THE OFFICIALS HAVE GONE TO MAKE THE PROPER ARRANGEMENTS WITH YOUR AUTHORITIES
A DREADFUL THING IF THERE IS A DEAD MAN THERE SAID SPARGO
THREW DOWN THE TILES AND LET FLY ARROWS AT THEM FROM WHICH THE PRISONERS SHELTERED THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THEY COULD MOST OF THEIR NUMBER MEANWHILE WERE ENGAGED IN DISPATCHING THEMSELVES BY THRUSTING INTO THEIR THROATS THE ARROWS SHOT BY THE ENEMY AND HANGING THEMSELVES WITH THE CORDS TAKEN FROM SOME BEDS THAT HAPPENED TO BE THERE
BUT WE FOUGHT WITH NO ONE YESTERDAY BUT THE DAY BEFORE IN THE RETREAT
AND GAVE HOSTAGES AND ALL OTHER SECURITIES REQUIRED THE SAME SUMMER THE ATHENIANS SENT THIRTY SHIPS ROUND PELOPONNESE UNDER DEMOSTHENES
AND THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND PRINCIPAL MEN OF THE PELOPONNESIANS BY DEMOSTHENES AND HIS ACARNANIAN COLLEAGUES WHO DESIRED TO STRIP THE AMBRACIOTS AND THE MERCENARY HOST OF FOREIGNERS OF THEIR SUPPORTERS AND ABOVE ALL TO DISCREDIT THE LACEDAEMONIANS AND PELOPONNESIANS WITH THE HELLENES IN THOSE PARTS
WHERE EURYLOCHUS AND HIS MEN CONFRONTED THE MESSENIANS AND DEMOSTHENES THE PELOPONNESIANS WERE NOW WELL ENGAGED AND WITH THEIR OUTFLANKING WING WERE UPON THE POINT OF TURNING THEIR ENEMY'S RIGHT
FIRST THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE MYONIANS WHO HELD THE MOST DIFFICULT OF THE PASSES
INDEED THIS WAS BY FAR THE GREATEST DISASTER THAT BEFELL ANY ONE HELLENIC CITY IN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THIS WAR
SON OF CAPATON UPON THE RIVER CAICINUS TOOK SOME ARMS AND DEPARTED
WERE AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT PROVE A VERY POWERFUL NEIGHBOUR AND ACCORDINGLY CONTINUALLY HARASSED AND MADE WAR UPON THE NEW SETTLERS UNTIL THEY AT LAST WORE THEM OUT IN SPITE OF THEIR ORIGINALLY CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS PEOPLE FLOCKING FROM ALL QUARTERS TO A PLACE FOUNDED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS
AT FIRST CAUSED SOME ALARM AT ATHENS WHICH THE EVENT HOWEVER DID NOTHING TO JUSTIFY THE TOWN NEVER GIVING THEM ANY TROUBLE THE REASON OF THIS WAS AS FOLLOWS
THE FIRST DAY HE TOOK POTIDANIA THE NEXT KROKYLE AND THE THIRD TICHIUM WHERE HE HALTED AND SENT BACK THE BOOTY TO EUPALIUM IN LOCRIS HAVING DETERMINED TO PURSUE HIS CONQUESTS AS FAR AS THE OPHIONIANS AND IN THE EVENT OF THEIR REFUSING TO SUBMIT
WHICH THE ACARNANIANS SET APART FOR DEMOSTHENES AND WHICH HE BROUGHT TO ATHENS IN PERSON HIS RETURN TO HIS COUNTRY AFTER THE AETOLIAN DISASTER BEING RENDERED LESS HAZARDOUS BY THIS EXPLOIT THE ATHENIANS IN THE TWENTY SHIPS ALSO WENT OFF TO NAUPACTUS
SUMMER WAS NOW OVER THE WINTER FOLLOWING THE PLAGUE A SECOND TIME ATTACKED THE ATHENIANS FOR ALTHOUGH IT HAD NEVER ENTIRELY LEFT THEM STILL THERE HAD BEEN A NOTABLE ABATEMENT IN ITS RAVAGES
AND THE TOWN WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL AS A STATION ON THE ROAD TO THRACE IN SHORT EVERYTHING MADE THE LACEDAEMONIANS EAGER TO FOUND THE PLACE AFTER FIRST CONSULTING THE GOD AT DELPHI AND RECEIVING A FAVOURABLE ANSWER THEY SENT OFF THE COLONISTS SPARTANS AND PERIOECI
LYCOPHRON THEIR GENERAL BEING AMONG THE NUMBER THE REST OF THE ARMY BROKEN AND PUT TO FLIGHT IN THIS WAY WITHOUT BEING SERIOUSLY PURSUED OR HURRIED RETIRED TO THE HIGH GROUND AND THERE TOOK UP ITS POSITION THE ATHENIANS FINDING THAT THE ENEMY NO LONGER OFFERED TO ENGAGE THEM
THE BOMIENSIANS AND CALLIENSIANS WHO EXTEND TOWARDS THE MALIAN GULF BEING AMONG THE NUMBER THE MESSENIANS HOWEVER ADHERED TO THEIR ORIGINAL ADVICE ASSURING DEMOSTHENES THAT THE AETOLIANS WERE AN EASY CONQUEST THEY URGED HIM TO PUSH ON AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
AND WITH THE REST ENCAMPED IN AMPHILOCHIA AT THE PLACE CALLED CRENAE OR THE WELLS TO WATCH FOR EURYLOCHUS AND HIS PELOPONNESIANS AND TO PREVENT THEIR PASSING THROUGH AND EFFECTING THEIR JUNCTION WITH THE AMBRACIOTS
MEANWHILE THE REST OF THE ARMY ON EITHER SIDE FOUGHT ON TENACIOUSLY ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT WING OF THE CORINTHIANS WHERE LYCOPHRON SUSTAINED THE ATTACK OF THE ATHENIAN LEFT WHICH IT WAS FEARED MIGHT ATTEMPT THE VILLAGE OF SOLYGIA AFTER HOLDING ON FOR A LONG WHILE WITHOUT EITHER GIVING WAY
THE NEXT SUMMER THE PELOPONNESIANS AND THEIR ALLIES SET OUT TO INVADE ATTICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF AGIS SON OF ARCHIDAMUS AND WENT AS FAR AS THE ISTHMUS BUT NUMEROUS EARTHQUAKES OCCURRING TURNED BACK AGAIN WITHOUT THE INVASION TAKING PLACE
THAT IT WAS A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM HAVING SO LARGE AN ARMY ASSEMBLED TO ATTACK THE AETOLIANS WHO WERE NOT ONLY THE ENEMIES OF NAUPACTUS BUT WHOSE REDUCTION WOULD FURTHER MAKE IT EASY TO GAIN THE REST OF THAT PART OF THE CONTINENT FOR THE ATHENIANS THE AETOLIAN NATION ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS AND WARLIKE
THINKING THAT THE WAR IN SICILY WOULD THUS BE THE SOONER ENDED AND ALSO WISHING TO EXERCISE THEIR NAVY ONE OF THE GENERALS PYTHODORUS WAS ACCORDINGLY SENT OUT WITH A FEW SHIPS
THE AMBRACIOTS AND SUCH OF THE REST AS HAD ACCOMPANIED THEM IN LARGER PARTIES SEEING THEM GOING ON PUSHED ON IN THEIR TURN AND BEGAN RUNNING IN ORDER TO CATCH THEM UP THE ACARNANIANS AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT ALL ALIKE WERE DEPARTING WITHOUT PERMISSION AND BEGAN TO PURSUE THE PELOPONNESIANS
THE DEAD THEY GAVE BACK TO HIM AND SETTING UP A TROPHY TOOK UP THEIR OWN ALSO TO THE NUMBER OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THE RETREAT DEMANDED THEY REFUSED PUBLICLY TO THE ARMY BUT PERMISSION TO DEPART WITHOUT DELAY WAS SECRETLY GRANTED TO THE MANTINEANS AND TO MENEDAIUS
THE AMBRACIOTS COULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO MARCH WITH THE ACARNANIANS AGAINST THE PELOPONNESIANS NOR THE ACARNANIANS WITH THE AMBRACIOTS AGAINST THE ATHENIANS FOR THE REST THE AMBRACIOTS WERE TO GIVE UP THE PLACES AND HOSTAGES THAT THEY HELD OF THE AMPHILOCHIANS
WHILE MEN CARRYING WHIPS WENT BY THEIR SIDE AND HASTENED ON THE ROAD THOSE THAT WALKED TOO SLOWLY AS MANY AS SIXTY MEN WERE TAKEN OUT AND KILLED IN THIS WAY WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FRIENDS IN THE BUILDING WHO FANCIED THEY WERE MERELY BEING MOVED FROM ONE PRISON TO ANOTHER
WITH THEIR HELLENIC ALLIES AND SUCH OF THE SICEL SUBJECTS OR ALLIES OF SYRACUSE AS HAD REVOLTED FROM HER AND JOINED THEIR ARMY MARCHED AGAINST THE SICEL TOWN INESSA THE ACROPOLIS OF WHICH WAS HELD BY THE SYRACUSANS AND AFTER ATTACKING IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE IT RETIRED
FINDING THAT THIS FORCE HAD ENTERED AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STORM THE TOWN WITHDREW NOT TO PELOPONNESE BUT TO THE COUNTRY ONCE CALLED AEOLIS AND NOW CALYDON AND PLEURON AND TO THE PLACES IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND PROSCHIUM IN AETOLIA
IN FIRST DAYS OF THE NEXT SUMMER THERE WAS AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME OF NEW MOON AND IN THE EARLY PART OF THE SAME MONTH AN EARTHQUAKE MEANWHILE THE MITYLENIAN AND OTHER LESBIAN EXILES SET OUT FOR THE MOST PART FROM THE CONTINENT WITH MERCENARIES HIRED IN PELOPONNESE
IN THIS EMBASSY JOINED ALSO THE DORIANS FROM THE MOTHER COUNTRY OF THE LACEDAEMONIANS WITH THE SAME REQUEST AS THEY THEMSELVES ALSO SUFFERED FROM THE SAME ENEMY AFTER HEARING THEM THE LACEDAEMONIANS DETERMINED TO SEND OUT THE COLONY WISHING TO ASSIST THE TRACHINIANS AND DORIANS
AGREEABLY TO A CONCERTED SIGNAL UNDER THE COMMAND OF HIPPONICUS SON OF CALLIAS AND EURYMEDON SON OF THUCLES THEY ENCAMPED AND PASSING THAT DAY IN RAVAGING THE TANAGRAEAN TERRITORY REMAINED THERE FOR THE NIGHT AND NEXT DAY AFTER DEFEATING THOSE OF THE TANAGRAEANS WHO SAILED OUT AGAINST THEM
HIS PREPARATIONS COMPLETED EURYLOCHUS LODGED THE HOSTAGES IN KYTINIUM IN DORIS AND ADVANCED UPON NAUPACTUS THROUGH THE COUNTRY OF THE LOCRIANS
HOW AM I TO GET OUT OF HERE HE ASKED AT LAST YOU MUST JUMP OUT REPLIED THE DOCTOR SINCE YOU HAVE JUMPED IN SO SOLOMON MADE A GREAT JUMP
ACT ACT LIKE A SOLDIER AND PROUDLY RUSH ON THE MOST VALIANT IN BRAVERY'S VAN WITH KEEN FLASHING SWORD CUT YOUR WAY TO THE FRONT AND SHOW TO THE WORLD YOU'RE A MAN
AND THE DOCTOR MARVELLED GREATLY AT SO MUCH WISDOM IN A LITTLE CHILD AND MADE A NOTE OF IT IN HIS NOTE BOOK SOLOMON WAS SO FULL OF WISDOM THAT IT FLOWED FROM HIS MOUTH IN A
YOU ARE SURELY MISTAKEN SIR SAID SOLOMON WITH THE GRAVITY THAT COMES FROM GREAT WISDOM THESE ARE OUR DOG'S FORE LEGS ARE THEY NOT POINTING TO THE FRONT LEGS OF THE DOG YES
FISHERMEN WEAR WHITE MITTENS FOR LUCK
ANYTHING THAT WILL ENTERTAIN AMUSE INSTRUCT THE HOME CIRCLE THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING OCCURRING IN YOUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS SOME CURIOUS EVENT OR THRILLING EPISODE THAT WILL FURNISH YOU WITH DATA FOR AN ARTICLE
THE MAN FROM CUMBERLAND AT ONCE RAN AFTER HIM AND CHASED HIM THROUGH THE STREETS AND DOWN THE LANES AND UP THE SIDE OF THE HILL WHERE THE BRAMBLE BUSHES GROW SOLOMON RAN VERY FAST BUT THE MAN FROM CUMBERLAND WAS BIGGER
HE WAS A VERY BIG MAN AND SOLOMON WAS A VERY LITTLE MAN AND SO THE PEOPLE ALL SHOOK THEIR HEADS SADLY AND FEARED SOLOMON HAD MET HIS MATCH FOR IF THE CUMBERLAND MAN WAS AS FULL OF WISDOM AS SOLOMON
BE SURE THAT NEWSPAPER WRITING OR LITERARY WORK IS NOT YOUR FORTE AND TURN TO SOMETHING ELSE IF NOTHING BETTER PRESENTS ITSELF
I WILL SLEEP UPON THE QUESTION AND TRY TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO MORROW BUT THE SCHOOLMASTER COULD NOT SLEEP HE REMAINED AWAKE ALL THE NIGHT TRYING TO THINK WHY A COW DRINKS WATER FROM A BROOK
YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING OF GENUINE HUMAN INTEREST TO OTHERS IF THERE IS NO NEWS HAPPENING
AND DO HIM REVERENCE AND WHEN HE HAD GROWN TO MANHOOD THE FAME OF HIS WISDOM SPREAD ALL OVER THE WORLD SO THAT ALL THE OTHER WISE MEN WERE JEALOUS AND TRIED IN MANY WAYS TO CONFOUND HIM
ON ITS SECULAR SIDE IT DEALS WITH HUMAN EVENTS IN SUCH AN IMPARTIAL WAY THAT EVERY ONE NO MATTER TO WHAT CLASS THEY MAY BELONG OR TO WHAT CREED THEY MAY SUBSCRIBE CAN TAKE A LIVING PERSONAL INTEREST
UNLESS YOU BRING OUT WHAT IS IN YOU GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE TO GROW AND SEIZE UPON EVERYTHING THAT WILL ENLARGE THE SCOPE OF YOUR HORIZON KEEP YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN
LIKE MYSELF HOWEVER SMALL LIKE MYSELF OR NOT AT ALL PUT YOURSELF IN PLACE OF THE READER AND WRITE WHAT WILL INTEREST YOURSELF
WE ARE ALL CONSTITUTED ALIKE AND THE CHANCES ARE THAT WHAT WILL INTEREST YOU WILL INTEREST OTHERS DESCRIPTIONS OF ADVENTURE ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE TELL OF A FOX HUNT OR A BADGER HUNT OR A BEAR CHASE
WOULD BE INJUDICIOUS FOR YOU TO SEND AN ARTICLE ON A PRIZE FIGHT TO A RELIGIOUS PAPER OR VICE VERSA AN ACCOUNT OF A CHURCH MEETING TO
HE HAD MUCH THE ADVANTAGE IN SIZE THEY FORMED A CIRCLE AROUND THE TWO WISE MEN AND THEN BEGAN THE TRIAL TO SEE WHICH WAS THE WISEST TELL ME
CALLED OUT THE DOCTOR I M IN THE ELDERBERRY BUSH AND I VE SCRATCHED MY EYES IN AGAIN ANSWERED SOLOMON WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY MARVELLED GREATLY
ANY GREAT OCCURRENCE IS TAKING PLACE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
IF YOU ARE OF THE MASCULINE GENDER
HIS FATHER THOUGHT HE HAD A WOND'ROUS WISE LOOK WHEN HE WAS BORN AND SO HE NAMED HIM SOLOMON THINKING THAT IF INDEED HE TURNED OUT TO BE WISE THE NAME WOULD FIT HIM NICELY WHEREAS SHOULD HE BE MISTAKEN AND THE BOY GROW UP STUPID
DEEPLY READ MEN AND WOMEN IN THE NEWSPAPER REALM
THAT IS ONE WHOSE EYEBROWS MEET IS UNLUCKY AND CAN CAST SPELLS
AS IT WILL BRING ILL LUCK
ALWAYS BE IN EARNEST IN YOUR WRITING GO ABOUT IT IN A DETERMINED KIND OF WAY
AND GIVEN IT CAREFUL THOUGHT AND YET I CANNOT TELL WHY A COW DRINKS WATER FROM A BROOK SIR REPLIED THE WISE CHILD IT IS BECAUSE THE COW IS THIRSTY
IT IS COMMON TO BLOW ON THE DEAL WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT FOR GOOD LUCK
YOU WILL LOSE BY IT ON THE COMING WEEK
FOR I HAVE NEVER YET HAD MY ATTENTION CALLED TO THIS SUBJECT SO HE THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN HE SAID I MUST REALLY GIVE IT UP I CANNOT TELL FOR THE LIFE OF ME WHY A MAN HAS TWO EYES
HAD NOT THE MAN LIVED THERE WHO WAS SO WISE THAT EVERYONE MARVELLED AT HIS GREAT KNOWLEDGE HE WAS NOT ALWAYS A WISE MAN HE WAS A WISE BOY BEFORE HE GREW TO MANHOOD
ANSWERED HIS FATHER WELL CONTINUED SOLOMON THE DOG HAS TWO OTHER LEGS BESIDES AND TWO AND FOUR ARE SIX THEREFORE THE DOG HAS SIX LEGS
HE JUMPED INTO A BRAMBLE BUSH AND SCRATCHED OUT BOTH HIS EYES AND WHEN HE SAW HIS EYES WERE OUT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND MAIN HE JUMPED INTO ANOTHER BUSH AND SCRATCHED THEM IN AGAIN
IF YOU COMPLETE DRESSING ONE FOOT BEFORE BEGINNING TO DRESS THE OTHER IT IS A SIGN YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED
AND THE PEOPLE ALL WEPT WITH GRIEF AT THIS AND SOLOMON HOWLED LOUDER THAN ANY OF THEM NOW THE FACT WAS THAT WHEN SOLOMON JUMPED INTO THE BRAMBLE BUSH HE WAS WEARING HIS SPECTACLES
THERE IS IN EVERY BREAST A SENSIBILITY TO MARKS OF HONOR OF FAVOR OF ESTEEM AND OF CONFIDENCE WHICH APART FROM ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF INTEREST IS SOME PLEDGE FOR GRATEFUL AND BENEVOLENT RETURNS
JUSTIFY OR EXTENUATE THE SHAMEFUL OUTRAGE HE HAS OFFERED TO THE DICTATES OF TRUTH AND TO THE RULES OF FAIR DEALING THE SECOND CLAUSE OF THE SECOND SECTION OF THE SECOND ARTICLE
NOR WOULD IT IN FACT BE LESS ERRONEOUS AS TO THE LAST THE ONLY DIFFERENCE DISCOVERABLE BETWEEN THE TWO CASES IS THAT EACH REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE ELECTED BY FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND CITIZENS WHILST IN THE INDIVIDUAL STATES
NOT ONLY OBVIATE ALL POSSIBILITY OF DOUBT BUT DESTROY THE PRETEXT OF MISCONCEPTION THE FORMER PROVIDES THAT THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES SHALL BE COMPOSED OF TWO SENATORS FROM EACH STATE
THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE THIRD THE TIME WITHIN WHICH THE POWER IS TO OPERATE DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE AND THE DURATION OF THE APPOINTMENTS TO THE END OF THE NEXT SESSION OF THAT BODY
THEY ARE TO BE THE SAME WHO EXERCISE THE RIGHT IN EVERY STATE OF ELECTING THE CORRESPONDING BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE WHO ARE TO BE THE OBJECTS OF POPULAR CHOICE
IS THE CONSEQUENCE FROM THIS DOCTRINE ADMISSIBLE IF WE SAY THAT FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED CITIZENS ARE AS MANY AS CAN JOINTLY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE MUST WE NOT DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE OF THE IMMEDIATE CHOICE OF THEIR PUBLIC SERVANTS
IF THIS CLAUSE IS TO BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE ONE WHICH PRECEDES THE VACANCIES OF WHICH IT SPEAKS MUST BE CONSTRUED TO RELATE TO THE OFFICERS DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING ONE AND THIS WE HAVE SEEN EXCLUDES FROM ITS DESCRIPTION
HE COULD SUPPOSE NOTHING LESS THAN THAT SOME UNREASONABLE QUALIFICATION OF PROPERTY WAS ANNEXED TO THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE OR THAT THE RIGHT OF ELIGIBILITY WAS LIMITED TO PERSONS OF PARTICULAR FAMILIES OR FORTUNES
THAT THE PRETENDED POWER OF THE PRESIDENT TO FILL VACANCIES IN THE SENATE HAS BEEN DEDUCED A SLIGHT ATTENTION TO THE CONNECTION OF THE CLAUSES AND TO THE OBVIOUS MEANING OF THE TERMS WILL SATISFY US THAT THE DEDUCTION IS NOT EVEN COLORABLE
CONSPIRE TO ELUCIDATE THE SENSE OF THE PROVISION WHICH IF IT HAD BEEN INTENDED TO COMPREHEND SENATORS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE REFERRED THE TEMPORARY POWER OF FILLING VACANCIES TO THE RECESS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURES
OR DISAPPOINT THE INCLINATION OF THE PEOPLE IF WE CONSIDER THE SITUATION OF THE MEN ON WHOM THE FREE SUFFRAGES OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS MAY CONFER THE REPRESENTATIVE TRUST
TUESDAY FEBRUARY NINETEENTH
TO THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF THE FEW OF ALL THE OBJECTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN FRAMED AGAINST THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WHILST THE OBJECTION ITSELF IS LEVELLED AGAINST A PRETENDED OLIGARCHY
IF THE SAME ELECTORS AT THE SAME TIME ARE CAPABLE OF CHOOSING FOUR OR FIVE REPRESENTATIVES THEY CANNOT BE INCAPABLE OF CHOOSING ONE PENNSYLVANIA IS AN ADDITIONAL EXAMPLE SOME OF HER COUNTIES WHICH ELECT HER STATE REPRESENTATIVES
AND AN ABHORRENCE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF THIS BE THE POINT ON WHICH THE OBJECTION TURNS IT DESERVES TO BE EXAMINED IS IT SUPPORTED BY REASON THIS CANNOT BE SAID WITHOUT MAINTAINING THAT FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND CITIZENS
AND UNRESERVED INDIGNATION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BESTOW THE IMPUTATION OF DELIBERATE IMPOSTURE AND DECEPTION UPON THE GROSS PRETENSE OF A SIMILITUDE BETWEEN A KING OF GREAT BRITAIN
IN SO FLAGRANT A CASE TO ALLOW MYSELF A SEVERITY OF ANIMADVERSION LITTLE CONGENIAL WITH THE GENERAL SPIRIT OF THESE PAPERS I HESITATE NOT TO SUBMIT IT TO THE DECISION OF ANY CANDID AND HONEST ADVERSARY
SO THE CHOICE WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO BE DIVERTED FROM HIM
FOR THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL THIS IS THE CASE IN ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES OF THE STATE ARE NOT THESE FACTS THE MOST SATISFACTORY PROOFS OF THE FALLACY WHICH HAS BEEN EMPLOYED AGAINST THE BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER CONSIDERATION
CALCULATING ON THE NUMBER OF SIXTY FIVE REPRESENTATIVES ONLY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE THAT IN THESE SENATORIAL DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES A NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES ARE VOTED FOR BY EACH ELECTOR AT THE SAME TIME
NOT THE HAUGHTY HEIRS OF DISTINGUISHED NAMES MORE THAN THE HUMBLE SONS OF OBSCURITY AND UNPROPITIOUS FORTUNE
THE PRETENSIONS OF RANK AND WEALTH NO PERSON IS ELIGIBLE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A COUNTY UNLESS HE POSSESS REAL ESTATE OF THE CLEAR VALUE OF SIX HUNDRED POUNDS STERLING PER YEAR NOR OF A CITY OR BOROUGH UNLESS HE POSSESS A LIKE ESTATE
AND WHO UPON THIS FALSE AND UNFOUNDED SUGGESTION HAS BUILT A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS EQUALLY FALSE AND UNFOUNDED LET HIM NOW BE CONFRONTED WITH THE EVIDENCE OF THE FACT AND LET HIM IF HE BE ABLE
IN WHOSE REPRESENTATION THE VACANCIES HAD HAPPENED INSTEAD OF MAKING IT TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE ENSUING SESSION OF THE NATIONAL SENATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BODY AUTHORIZED TO MAKE THE PERMANENT APPOINTMENTS
HAS IT APPEARED ON TRIAL THAT THE SENATORS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW YORK OR THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF PENNSYLVANIA OR THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY
EMPOWERS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO NOMINATE AND BY AND WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE TO APPOINT AMBASSADORS OTHER PUBLIC MINISTERS AND CONSULS JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT
AND WHO ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WILL NOT REQUIRE A FUTURE ESTABLISHMENT BY LAW THIS POSITION WILL HARDLY BE CONTESTED THE LAST OF THESE TWO CLAUSES IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR
AND THERE IS PERHAPS NONE WHICH HAS BEEN INVEIGHED AGAINST WITH LESS CANDOR OR CRITICISED WITH LESS JUDGMENT HERE THE WRITERS AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN PAINS TO SIGNALIZE THEIR TALENT OF MISREPRESENTATION
MISTER MORRIS WAS LOOKING STEADILY AT THE WINDOW AND HE NOW GOT UP QUIETLY AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE AND THEN THE PROFESSOR WENT ON AND NOW WE MUST SETTLE WHAT WE DO WE HAVE HERE MUCH DATA AND WE MUST PROCEED TO LAY OUT OUR CAMPAIGN
BUT EVEN BY HIS PATIENTS WHO BEING SOME OF THEM HARDLY IN MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM
DID YOU HIT IT ASKED DOCTOR VAN HELSING I DON'T KNOW I FANCY NOT FOR IT FLEW AWAY INTO THE WOOD WITHOUT SAYING ANY MORE HE TOOK HIS SEAT AND THE PROFESSOR
STRENGTH BEING THE BEST SAFETY THROUGH CARE OF ME BUT THEIR MINDS WERE MADE UP AND THOUGH IT WAS A BITTER PILL FOR ME TO SWALLOW I COULD SAY NOTHING SAVE TO ACCEPT THEIR CHIVALROUS CARE OF ME MISTER MORRIS RESUMED THE DISCUSSION AS THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE
ON THIS OCCASION MY EXPECTATION WAS NOT REALISED FOR WHEN HE FOUND THAT HIS APPEAL WOULD NOT BE SUCCESSFUL HE GOT INTO QUITE A FRANTIC CONDITION
WE KNOW FROM THE INQUIRY OF JONATHAN THAT FROM THE CASTLE TO WHITBY CAME FIFTY BOXES OF EARTH ALL OF WHICH WERE DELIVERED AT CARFAX WE ALSO KNOW
SO AS WE ALL TOOK HANDS OUR SOLEMN COMPACT WAS MADE I FELT MY HEART ICY COLD
OR WAS JEALOUS OF SOME INTERFERENCE
WHICH HAD BEEN AT SIX O'CLOCK WE UNCONSCIOUSLY FORMED A SORT OF BOARD OR COMMITTEE PROFESSOR VAN HELSING TOOK THE HEAD OF THE TABLE TO WHICH DOCTOR SEWARD MOTIONED HIM AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM HE MADE ME SIT NEXT TO HIM ON HIS RIGHT AND ASKED ME TO ACT AS SECRETARY JONATHAN SAT NEXT TO ME
WHEN I WENT INTO THE ROOM I TOLD THE MAN THAT A LADY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM TO WHICH HE SIMPLY ANSWERED WHY SHE IS GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE
YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO CONTEND AGAINST BUT WE TOO ARE NOT WITHOUT STRENGTH
I APPEAL TO YOUR FRIENDS HE SAID THEY WILL PERHAPS NOT MIND SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON MY CASE BY THE WAY YOU HAVE NOT INTRODUCED ME I WAS SO MUCH ASTONISHED THAT THE ODDNESS OF INTRODUCING A MADMAN IN AN ASYLUM DID NOT STRIKE ME AT THE MOMENT AND BESIDES
WITH THIS TERRIBLE AND MYSTERIOUS ENEMY MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL THIRTY SEPTEMBER
YOU DON'T KNOW WHOM YOU WRONG OR HOW AND I MAY NOT TELL WOE IS ME I MAY NOT TELL BY ALL YOU HOLD SACRED BY ALL YOU HOLD DEAR BY YOUR LOVE THAT IS LOST BY YOUR HOPE THAT LIVES
HE SAID TO MISSUS HARKER I AM TOLD MADAM MINA BY MY FRIEND JOHN THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND HAVE PUT UP IN EXACT ORDER ALL THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN UP TO THIS MOMENT NOT UP TO THIS MOMENT PROFESSOR SHE SAID IMPULSIVELY BUT UP TO THIS MORNING BUT WHY NOT UP TO NOW
THE DOCTOR HERE WILL BEAR ME OUT THAT ON ONE OCCASION I TRIED TO KILL HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF STRENGTHENING MY VITAL POWERS BY THE ASSIMILATION WITH MY OWN BODY OF HIS LIFE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF HIS BLOOD RELYING OF COURSE UPON THE SCRIPTURAL PHRASE FOR THE BLOOD IS THE LIFE THOUGH INDEED THE VENDOR OF A CERTAIN NOSTRUM
SHE CAME AT ONCE AFTER SAYING PLEASANTLY TO MISTER RENFIELD GOOD BYE
AND FROM ALL THE MEANS THAT ARE HE TELL ME OF WHAT HE HAS BEEN
HE CAN FLOURISH WHEN THAT HE CAN FATTEN ON THE BLOOD OF THE LIVING EVEN MORE
THE PROFESSOR READ IT OVER GRAVELY AND HANDED IT BACK SAYING IT NEED NOT GO IN IF YOU DO NOT WISH IT
THERE WAS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN THE MAN'S MANNER SO MUCH OF THE HABIT OF EQUALITY THAT I AT ONCE MADE THE INTRODUCTION LORD GODALMING PROFESSOR VAN HELSING MISTER QUINCEY MORRIS OF TEXAS
ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES CAN HE HAVE LIMITED FREEDOM IF HE BE NOT AT THE PLACE WHITHER HE IS BOUND HE CAN ONLY CHANGE HIMSELF AT NOON
I LEFT THE BOYS BEHIND ME POOR ART SEEMED MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAS BEEN SINCE LUCY FIRST TOOK ILL AND QUINCEY IS MORE LIKE HIS OWN BRIGHT SELF THAN HE HAS BEEN FOR MANY A LONG DAY
MY FEARS HOWEVER WERE GROUNDLESS FOR HE HELD UP HIS TWO HANDS IMPLORINGLY
AS WELL AS THE BRAVEST OF THE SONS OF THE LAND BEYOND THE FOREST THAT MIGHTY BRAIN AND THAT IRON RESOLUTION WENT WITH HIM TO HIS GRAVE AND ARE EVEN NOW ARRAYED AGAINST US THE DRACULAS WERE SAYS ARMINIUS A GREAT AND NOBLE RACE
OPPOSITE US WERE LORD GODALMING DOCTOR SEWARD AND MISTER MORRIS LORD GODALMING BEING NEXT THE PROFESSOR AND DOCTOR SEWARD IN THE CENTRE THE PROFESSOR SAID I MAY I SUPPOSE TAKE IT THAT WE ARE ALL ACQUAINTED WITH THE FACTS THAT ARE IN THESE PAPERS
HE SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OF THEM SAYING IN TURN LORD GODALMING I HAD THE HONOUR OF SECONDING YOUR FATHER AT THE WINDHAM I GRIEVE TO KNOW BY YOUR HOLDING THE TITLE THAT HE IS NO MORE HE WAS A MAN LOVED AND HONOURED BY ALL WHO KNEW HIM
HE CAN COME IN MIST WHICH HE CREATE THAT NOBLE SHIP'S CAPTAIN PROVED HIM OF THIS BUT FROM WHAT WE KNOW THE DISTANCE HE CAN MAKE THIS MIST IS LIMITED AND IT CAN ONLY BE ROUND HIMSELF HE COME ON MOONLIGHT RAYS AS ELEMENTAL DUST
BUT NONE OF THE OTHERS AT FIRST SAID ANYTHING HIS REQUEST WAS THAT I WOULD AT ONCE RELEASE HIM FROM THE ASYLUM AND SEND HIM HOME THIS HE BACKED UP WITH ARGUMENTS REGARDING HIS COMPLETE RECOVERY
AN ARROW IN THE SIDE OF HIM WHO DIED FOR MAN BUT WE ARE FACE TO FACE WITH DUTY
WHICH WE ALL UNDERSTAND TOO WELL THERE HAVE BEEN FROM THE LOINS OF THIS VERY ONE GREAT MEN AND GOOD WOMEN AND THEIR GRAVES MAKE SACRED THE EARTH WHERE ALONE THIS FOULNESS CAN DWELL
AND WOULD SEE ABOUT THE NECESSARY FORMALITIES FOR HIS RELEASE IN THE MORNING I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO WAIT HOWEVER BEFORE MAKING SO GRAVE A STATEMENT FOR OF OLD I KNEW THE SUDDEN CHANGES TO WHICH THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT WAS LIABLE SO I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH MAKING A GENERAL STATEMENT
HE SAID CHEERFULLY LET THE LADY COME IN AND SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED WITH HIS HEAD DOWN
AND IN SLEEP FROM HER DREAMS AND BESIDES SHE IS YOUNG WOMAN AND NOT SO LONG MARRIED THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS TO THINK OF SOME TIME IF NOT NOW YOU TELL ME SHE HAS WROTE ALL THEN SHE MUST CONSULT WITH US
NO MATTER HOW LOW IN THE SCALE OF CREATION ONE MIGHT INDEFINITELY PROLONG LIFE
THE PROFESSOR STOOD UP AND AFTER LAYING HIS GOLDEN CRUCIFIX ON THE TABLE HELD OUT HIS HAND ON EITHER SIDE I TOOK HIS RIGHT HAND AND LORD GODALMING HIS LEFT JONATHAN HELD MY RIGHT WITH HIS LEFT AND STRETCHED ACROSS TO MISTER MORRIS
SINCE I MYSELF HAVE BEEN AN INMATE OF A LUNATIC ASYLUM I CANNOT BUT NOTICE THAT THE SOPHISTIC TENDENCIES OF SOME OF ITS INMATES LEAN TOWARDS THE ERRORS OF NON CAUSA AND IGNORATIO ELENCHI I POSITIVELY OPENED MY EYES AT THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT
A SACRED BULLET FIRED INTO THE COFFIN KILL HIM SO THAT HE BE TRUE DEAD AND AS FOR THE STAKE THROUGH HIM WE KNOW ALREADY OF ITS PEACE OR THE CUT OFF HEAD THAT GIVETH REST WE HAVE SEEN IT
SITTING BY THE FIRE IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM I APPROACHED THAT ISLAND IN MY FANCY FROM EVERY POSSIBLE DIRECTION I EXPLORED EVERY ACRE OF ITS SURFACE
AS IF ABOUT TO COLLAPSE BEHIND THE CAB AND THE INFIRM HORSE WITH THE HARNESS HUNG OVER HIS SHARP BACKBONE FLAPPING VERY LOOSE ABOUT HIS THIGHS APPEARED TO BE DANCING MINCINGLY ON HIS TOES
IN THE NARROW STREETS THE PROGRESS OF THE JOURNEY WAS MADE SENSIBLE TO THOSE WITHIN BY THE NEAR FRONTS OF THE HOUSES GLIDING PAST SLOWLY AND SHAKILY WITH A GREAT RATTLE AND JINGLING OF GLASS
HAVING INFUSED BY PERSISTENT IMPORTUNITIES SOME SORT OF HEAT INTO THE CHILLY INTEREST OF SEVERAL LICENSED VICTUALLERS THE ACQUAINTANCES ONCE UPON A TIME OF HER LATE UNLUCKY HUSBAND
POSTSCRIPT I DID NOT TELL YOU THAT BLANDLY WHO BY THE WAY IS TO SEND A CONSORT AFTER US IF WE DON'T TURN UP BY THE END OF AUGUST HAD FOUND AN ADMIRABLE FELLOW FOR SAILING MASTER A STIFF MAN WHICH I REGRET
HIS SABRE CUT CHEEK AND HIS OLD BRASS TELESCOPE NEXT MOMENT WE HAD TURNED THE CORNER AND MY HOME WAS OUT OF SIGHT THE MAIL PICKED US UP ABOUT DUSK AT THE ROYAL GEORGE ON THE HEATH
AT THAT I GAVE UP ALL ATTEMPTS AT COMMENTARY AND READ STRAIGHT ON BLANDLY HIMSELF FOUND THE HISPANIOLA AND BY THE MOST ADMIRABLE MANAGEMENT GOT HER FOR THE MEREST TRIFLE
PROPPED ON HIS CRUTCH TALKING TO A CUSTOMER MISTER SILVER SIR I ASKED HOLDING OUT THE NOTE YES MY LAD SAID HE SUCH IS MY NAME TO BE SURE AND WHO MAY YOU BE AND THEN AS HE SAW THE SQUIRE'S LETTER
HANGING TO THREADS THAT SEEMED NO THICKER THAN A SPIDER'S THOUGH I HAD LIVED BY THE SHORE ALL MY LIFE I SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE BEEN NEAR THE SEA TILL THEN THE SMELL OF TAR AND SALT WAS SOMETHING NEW
WE WAS A TALKIN OF KEEL HAULING ANSWERED MORGAN KEEL HAULING WAS YOU AND A MIGHTY SUITABLE THING TOO AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT GET BACK TO YOUR PLACE FOR A LUBBER TOM AND THEN AS MORGAN ROLLED BACK TO HIS SEAT
CATCHING SIGHT OF A HOOKED IRON CONTRIVANCE PROTRUDING FROM THE LEFT SLEEVE OF THE MAN'S COAT MISSUS VERLOC'S MOTHER LOST SUDDENLY THE HEROIC COURAGE OF THESE DAYS SHE REALLY COULDN'T TRUST HERSELF
THAT HE MIGHT PROVE TO BE THE VERY ONE LEGGED SAILOR WHOM I HAD WATCHED FOR SO LONG AT THE OLD BENBOW BUT ONE LOOK AT THE MAN BEFORE ME WAS ENOUGH I HAD SEEN THE CAPTAIN AND BLACK DOG AND THE BLIND MAN PEW
TILL THE MOST REMARKABLE STROKE OF FORTUNE BROUGHT ME THE VERY MAN THAT I REQUIRED I WAS STANDING ON THE DOCK WHEN BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT I FELL IN TALK WITH HIM I FOUND HE WAS AN OLD SAILOR KEPT A PUBLIC HOUSE
YOU NEVER IMAGINED A SWEETER SCHOONER A CHILD MIGHT SAIL HER TWO HUNDRED TONS NAME HISPANIOLA I GOT HER THROUGH MY OLD FRIEND BLANDLY WHO HAS PROVED HIMSELF THROUGHOUT THE MOST SURPRISING TRUMP
THE DELICACY GUIDING HER CHOICE TO THE LEAST VALUABLE AND MOST DILAPIDATED ARTICLES PASSED UNACKNOWLEDGED BECAUSE WINNIE'S PHILOSOPHY CONSISTED IN NOT TAKING NOTICE OF THE INSIDE OF FACTS
THE MOST TRANSPARENT CALUMNIES NONE OF THEM DARE HOWEVER TO DENY THE MERITS OF THE SHIP SO FAR THERE WAS NOT A HITCH THE WORKPEOPLE TO BE SURE RIGGERS AND WHAT NOT WERE MOST ANNOYINGLY SLOW BUT TIME CURED THAT
HAD ACQUIRED A DISMAL BUT RESIGNED NOTION OF THE FANTASTIC SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE WHAT IF MISTER VERLOC SUDDENLY TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD
THE ADMIRABLE FELLOW LITERALLY SLAVED IN MY INTEREST AND SO I MAY SAY DID EVERYONE IN BRISTOL AS SOON AS THEY GOT WIND OF THE PORT WE SAILED FOR TREASURE I MEAN REDRUTH SAID I INTERRUPTING THE LETTER
LEANING OVER FROM HIS BOX HE WHISPERED WITH MYSTERIOUS INDIGNATION WHAT WAS THE MATTER NOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO TREAT A MAN SO HIS ENORMOUS AND UNWASHED COUNTENANCE FLAMED RED
WITH INFINITE PATIENCE LATER ON IN THE WIDER SPACE OF WHITEHALL ALL VISUAL EVIDENCES OF MOTION BECAME IMPERCEPTIBLE THE RATTLE AND JINGLE OF GLASS
I CLIMBED A THOUSAND TIMES TO THAT TALL HILL THEY CALL THE SPY GLASS AND FROM THE TOP ENJOYED THE MOST WONDERFUL AND CHANGING PROSPECTS SOMETIMES THE ISLE WAS THICK WITH SAVAGES WITH WHOM WE FOUGHT
WITH A GENTLE SAD VOICE BUT SO VERY VERY THIN AND QUIET HE WAS LIKE A SHADOW MY DEAR WINNIE PROLONGING HER DUSTING OPERATIONS TILL THE TALE WAS TOLD TO THE END
AND KEEPING A BRIGHT LOOKOUT FOR A LITTLE TAVERN WITH A LARGE BRASS TELESCOPE FOR SIGN I SET OFF OVERJOYED AT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SEE SOME MORE OF THE SHIPS AND SEAMEN
ROLLING HIS QUID NOW MORGAN SAID LONG JOHN VERY STERNLY YOU NEVER CLAPPED YOUR EYES ON THAT BLACK BLACK DOG BEFORE DID YOU NOW NOT I SIR SAID MORGAN WITH A SALUTE YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIS NAME DID YOU NO SIR
WENT ON INDEFINITELY IN FRONT OF THE LONG TREASURY BUILDING AND TIME ITSELF SEEMED TO STAND STILL AT LAST WINNIE OBSERVED THIS ISN'T A VERY GOOD HORSE
WOULD PERHAPS NOT BROOK BEING BEHOLDEN TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW FOR THE CHAIRS HE SAT ON IN A LONG EXPERIENCE OF GENTLEMEN LODGERS MISSUS VERLOC'S MOTHER
HE USED TO COME HERE WITH A BLIND BEGGAR HE USED THAT HE DID YOU MAY BE SURE SAID I I KNEW THAT BLIND MAN TOO HIS NAME WAS PEW

ONLY MADE JUDE THE MORE MISERABLE THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO WOO HER AND HE LEFT THE COTTAGE OF HIS AUNT THAT DAY WITH A HEAVY HEART HE WOULD FAIN HAVE GLANCED INTO THE SCHOOL TO SEE THE ROOM IN WHICH SUE'S LITTLE FIGURE HAD SO GLORIFIED ITSELF
NOW ABANDONED PECKED ITS NEIGHBOUR SMARTLY AND THE VANE ON THE NEW VICTORIAN GOTHIC CHURCH IN THE NEW SPOT HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CREAK
IT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE INTRUSIVE VULGAR PUSHING APPLICATIONS WHICH ARE SO COMMON IN THESE DAYS HE THOUGHT WHY COULDN'T I KNOW BETTER THAN ADDRESS UTTER STRANGERS IN SUCH A WAY I MAY BE AN IMPOSTOR AN IDLE SCAMP
THAT WAS SET AMIDST THIS QUAINT AND SINGULAR CITY IT HAD WINDOWS ALL ROUND FROM WHICH AN OUTLOOK OVER THE WHOLE TOWN AND ITS EDIFICES COULD BE GAINED JUDE'S EYES SWEPT ALL THE VIEWS IN SUCCESSION MEDITATIVELY
MOURNFULLY YET STURDILY THOSE BUILDINGS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND PRIVILEGES WERE NOT FOR HIM FROM THE LOOMING ROOF OF THE GREAT LIBRARY INTO WHICH HE HARDLY EVER HAD TIME TO ENTER HIS GAZE TRAVELLED ON TO THE VARIED SPIRES
THAT THE REACTION FROM THE LONG STRAIN TO WHICH HE HAD SUBJECTED HIMSELF SHOULD AFFECT HIM DISASTROUSLY PHILLOTSON HAD NO DOUBT PASSED THROUGH A SIMILAR INTELLECTUAL DISAPPOINTMENT TO THAT WHICH NOW ENVELOPED HIM BUT THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD BEEN SINCE BLEST
AND WROTE ALONG THE WALL I HAVE UNDERSTANDING AS WELL AS YOU I AM NOT INFERIOR TO YOU YEA WHO KNOWETH NOT SUCH THINGS AS THESE
NOW YOU'VE BEEN SEEING HER SAID THE HARSH OLD WOMAN AND WHAT DID I TELL EE WELL THAT
AND WHEN HE CAME OUT IT WAS NIGHT BY THE LIGHT OF THE FLICKERING LAMPS HE RAMBLED HOME TO SUPPER AND HAD NOT LONG BEEN SITTING AT TABLE WHEN HIS LANDLADY BROUGHT UP A LETTER THAT HAD JUST ARRIVED FOR HIM SHE LAID IT DOWN AS IF IMPRESSED
HE SAW WHAT A CURIOUS AND CUNNING GLAMOUR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE PLACE HAD EXERCISED OVER HIM TO GET THERE AND LIVE THERE TO MOVE AMONG THE CHURCHES AND HALLS AND BECOME IMBUED WITH THE GENIUS LOCI HAD SEEMED TO HIS DREAMING YOUTH
A MAN WITH A BAD CHARACTER FOR ALL THAT THEY KNOW TO THE CONTRARY PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT I AM NEVERTHELESS HE FOUND HIMSELF CLINGING TO THE HOPE OF SOME REPLY AS TO HIS ONE LAST CHANCE OF REDEMPTION HE WAITED DAY AFTER DAY
IT HAD MORE HISTORY THAN THE OLDEST COLLEGE IN THE CITY IT WAS LITERALLY TEEMING STRATIFIED WITH THE SHADES OF HUMAN GROUPS WHO HAD MET THERE FOR TRAGEDY COMEDY FARCE REAL ENACTMENTS OF THE INTENSEST KIND
WENT ON IN A MOMENT IN A REVIVED VOICE RAISING IT AS HE NEARED THE END WITH THE MANNER OF A PRIEST LEADING A CONGREGATION ET IN SPIRITUM SANCTUM DOMINUM ET VIVIFICANTEM
THE CONVERSATION WAXED GENERAL CHRISTMINSTER SOCIETY WAS CRITICIZED THE DONS MAGISTRATES AND OTHER PEOPLE IN AUTHORITY BEING SINCERELY PITIED FOR THEIR SHORTCOMINGS WHILE OPINIONS ON HOW THEY OUGHT TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES AND THEIR AFFAIRS TO BE PROPERLY RESPECTED
AND HE BEHELD IT IN ALL THE GHASTLINESS OF A RIGHT MIND SHE KNEW THE WORST OF HIM THE VERY WORST HOW COULD HE FACE HER NOW SHE WOULD SOON BE COMING DOWN TO SEE ABOUT BREAKFAST AS SHE HAD SAID
ALL BOYS EXCEPT HERSELF AND THEN THEY'D CHEER HER AND THEN SHE'D SAY DON'T BE SAUCY BOYS AND SUDDENLY RUN INDOORS THEY'D TRY TO COAX HER OUT AGAIN BUT A WOULDN'T COME THESE RETROSPECTIVE VISIONS OF SUE
AND THE OTHER SUPPORTING HIM SHE LED HIM INDOORS AND PLACED HIM IN THE ONLY EASY CHAIR THE MEAGRELY FURNISHED HOUSE AFFORDED STRETCHING HIS FEET UPON ANOTHER AND PULLING OFF HIS BOOTS JUDE NOW GETTING TOWARDS HIS SOBER SENSES COULD ONLY SAY DEAR DEAR SUE
IN THE EVENING THE FREQUENTERS OF THE HOUSE DROPPED IN ONE BY ONE JUDE STILL RETAINING HIS SEAT IN THE CORNER THOUGH HIS MONEY WAS ALL SPENT AND HE HAD NOT EATEN ANYTHING THE WHOLE DAY EXCEPT A BISCUIT

ON MISTER HEATHERSTONE REPEATING TO HIM HIS INTENTIONS RELATIVE TO ARNWOOD EXPRESSED HIS SENSE OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT SIMPLY ADDING YOU MAY THINK ME IMPETUOUS SIR BUT I TRUST YOU WILL BELIEVE ME GRATEFUL
HE CAN NOT REFUSE IT PUT NOT YOUR TRUST IN PRINCES BROTHER REPLIED ALICE I DOUBT IF THE KING OR HIS COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER IT ADVISABLE TO MAKE SO MANY DISCONTENTED
NAY EDWARD RECOLLECT THAT I HAVE AS EDITH OBSERVED PASSED MY LIFE IN THE WOODS EDWARD WAS MOST KINDLY RECEIVED BY MISTER HEATHERSTONE EDWARD
THEN ALL WAS EXPLAINED ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE RESTORATION THERE WAS A FETE AT HAMPTON COURT GIVEN IN HONOR OF THREE MARRIAGES TAKING PLACE EDWARD BEVERLEY TO PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE CHALONER
NO LESS THAN ONE WITH WHOM YOU WERE FORMERLY WELL ACQUAINTED EDWARD PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE CRIED EDWARD THE TOAST OF ALL LONDON YES AND DESERVEDLY SO
IS RECEIVING A FAVOR WERE IT GIVEN AS A MARRIAGE PORTION WITH HIS DAUGHTER NOW WHY SHOULD I ACCEPT AS A FAVOR WHAT I CAN CLAIM AS A RIGHT IT IS MY INTENTION OF APPEALING TO THE KING AND DEMANDING THE RESTORATION OF MY PROPERTY
ALTHOUGH NOT SAID IT IS EXPECTED THAT SHE IS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE TRANSFER AND I WILL ACCEPT NO WIFE ON SUCH CONDITIONS THAT IS TO SAY BECAUSE ALL YOU WISH FOR YOUR PROPERTY AND A WOMAN YOU LOVE ARE OFFERED YOU IN ONE LOT
AND NOW LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE FOR YOUR FRIENDS MASTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE THAT MUCH OF THEIR PROPERTY HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND PUT INTO OTHER HANDS I KNOW AND PROBABLY THEY EXPECT IT WILL BE RESTORED UPON THEIR APPLICATION TO THE KING
AT ALL EVENTS EDWARD RECOLLECT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE THE INTENTIONS OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE PROFFERS FIRST BUT MY DEAR SISTER IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE EVIDENT
REPLIED EDITH TO BE SURE YOU DO NOT MEET MANY IN THE NEW FOREST WHERE YOU HAVE LIVED ALL YOUR LIFE VERY TRUE MY DEAR SISTER PERHAPS THAT IS THE REASON THAT THE NEW FOREST HAS HAD SUCH CHARMS FOR ME
WAS MET AT DOVER BY GENERAL MONK AND CONDUCTED TO LONDON WHICH HE ENTERED AMID THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE PEOPLE ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF THE SAME MONTH WE MAY LEAVE THE READER TO SUPPOSE THAT EDWARD
EDWARD HALF CONCEALED HIMSELF BEHIND ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE MIGHT GAZE UPON HER WITHOUT RESERVE
AND HAD BEEN RE ENFORCED BY TROOPS FROM SPAIN SET UP THE STANDARD OF REVOLT EDWARD AND HIS FRIENDS JOINED THEM WITH ABOUT THREE HUNDRED ENGLISH AND SCOTCHMEN WHICH THEY HAD ENLISTED AND VERY SOON AFTERWARD
LET HER FATHER BUT GIVE ME HER AND ARNWOOD WILL BE BUT A TRIFLE IN ADDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH YOU ARE TO POSSESS ARNWOOD SAID HUMPHREY I CAN INFORM YOU WHAT THEY ARE
HOW CAN YOU SAY SO EDWARD YOU RECEIVED HUMPHREY'S LETTERS A LONG WHILE AGO YES I DID BUT LET US NOT TALK ABOUT IT ANY MORE MY DEAR EDITH I AM IN GREAT PERPLEXITY
AND THE KING'S OBLIGATIONS TO THEM ARE MUCH GREATER THAN THEY ARE TO YOU BESIDES MERELY FOR WHAT MAY BE CALLED A POINT OF HONOR FOR IT IS NO MORE IN WHAT AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION WILL YOU PUT HIS MAJESTY
AND IT MAY BE TRUE REPLIED EDWARD MOURNFULLY WELL
AND TIME AND ABSENCE HAVE THEIR EFFECT UPON THE MOST ARDENT OF LOVERS THE SIGHT OF HER SO RESPLENDENT IN BEAUTY ACTED UPON HIM LIKE MAGIC AND HE WAS UNEASY TILL THE CEREMONY WAS OVER AND HE WAS ENABLED TO GO TO HIS SISTERS
FOR WHILE THEY HAD BEEN SPEAKING THE PROCESSION HAD STOPPED IS IT POSSIBLE THOUGHT EDWARD THAT THESE CAN BE THE TWO GIRLS IN RUSSET GOWNS THAT I LEFT AT THE COTTAGE AND YET IT MUST BE
FOR SHE WAS LYING STRETCHED ON THE GROUND COVERED WITH BLOOD AND WEEPING BITTERLY TRAITRESS CRIED THE GENIUS IS NOT THIS MAN YOUR LOVER SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES SLOWLY AND LOOKED SADLY AT ME I NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE SHE ANSWERED SLOWLY
I DON'T UNDERSTAND NO MATTER HE REPLIED GO BACK BY THE PATH THAT YOU CAME HE WOULD SAY NO MORE AND GREATLY PUZZLED I RETURNED TO MY ROOM IN THE PALACE AND WENT TO BED
I DO NOT KNOW WHO HE IS WHAT EXCLAIMED THE GENIUS
AND THE SIN WHEN IT IS FULL GROWN BRINGETH FORTH DEATH
OTHERS IN THE WESTERN WORLD FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS REGARD THE SAME ACT AS WRONG IS THE LIGHTING OR SMOKING OF A CIGAR A SIN FOR THESE CLASSES IS THE ACT NECESSARILY WRONG IN ITSELF
BUT STAY HERE WITH ME INSTEAD AND WE CAN BE HAPPY AND ALL YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IS TO BETAKE YOURSELF TO THE FOREST EVERY TENTH DAY WHEN I AM EXPECTING MY MASTER THE GENIUS HE IS VERY JEALOUS AS YOU KNOW AND WILL NOT SUFFER A MAN TO COME NEAR ME
ALLOW ME TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THIS MEETING WHICH IS NOT ONLY A CONSOLATION TO ME IN MY OWN HEAVY SORROW BUT MAY PERHAPS ENABLE ME TO RENDER YOUR LOT HAPPIER AND THEN I TOLD HER WHO I WAS AND HOW I HAD COME THERE ALAS PRINCE
AT MY FATHER'S DESIRE I WAS MARRIED TO A PRINCE WHO WAS MY OWN COUSIN BUT ON MY VERY WEDDING DAY I WAS SNATCHED UP BY A GENIUS AND BROUGHT HERE IN A FAINT FOR A LONG WHILE I DID NOTHING BUT WEEP AND WOULD NOT SUFFER THE GENIUS TO COME NEAR ME
WITH A LONG GALLERY SUPPORTED BY PILLARS OF JASPER ORNAMENTED WITH CAPITALS OF GOLD DOWN THIS GALLERY A LADY CAME TO MEET ME OF SUCH BEAUTY THAT I FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE AND THOUGHT ONLY OF HER TO SAVE HER ALL THE TROUBLE POSSIBLE I HASTENED TOWARDS HER
AND WAS COME TO SEIZE THE KINGDOM OF MY UNCLE THE CAPITAL WAS UTTERLY UNPREPARED TO STAND A SIEGE AND SEEING THAT RESISTANCE WAS USELESS AT ONCE OPENED ITS GATES MY UNCLE FOUGHT HARD FOR HIS LIFE BUT WAS SOON OVERPOWERED AND WHEN HE FELL
WHEN HE TOUCHED THE GROUND HE RAPPED IT WITH HIS FOOT IT OPENED AND WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE ENCHANTED PALACE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS OF THE EBONY ISLE BUT HOW DIFFERENT SHE LOOKED FROM WHAT SHE WAS WHEN I HAD LAST SEEN HER
MOST OF THE ELEMENTS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE STORY MAY LIKEWISE BE TRACED IN EARLIER SEMITIC TRADITIONS THE AIM OF THE PROPHET WHO HAS GIVEN US THE STORY WAS ACCORDING TO THE VIEW OF CERTAIN INTERPRETERS TO PRESENT IN VIVID CONCRETE FORM
AND PULLING UP THE DOOR FOUND A STAIRCASE WHICH I HASTILY MADE UP MY MIND TO GO DOWN CARRYING MY HATCHET WITH ME BY WAY OF PROTECTION WHEN I REACHED THE BOTTOM I DISCOVERED THAT I WAS IN A HUGE PALACE AS BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AS ANY PALACE ABOVE GROUND THAT I HAD EVER SEEN
THAT WERE STRUGGLING IN THE MIND OF THE WOMAN AGAINST HER SENSE OF DUTY NOTE THAT IN THE STORY THE TEMPTATION DID NOT COME TO MAN THROUGH HIS APPETITE OR HIS CURIOSITY OR HIS ESTHETIC SENSE BUT THROUGH HIS WIFE WHOM GOD HAD GIVEN HIM
AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DRAGGED OUT OF A FIRE BEFORE IT HAD QUITE CONSUMED THEM THIS HORRIBLE SIGHT TURNED ME FAINT BUT TO MY SURPRISE MY UNCLE DID NOT SHOW SO MUCH SURPRISE AS ANGER I KNEW HE SAID
I WAS AWARE THAT MY SON WAS BUILDING A TOMB AND I THINK I CAN FIND THE SPOT BUT AS HE WISHED TO KEEP THE MATTER SECRET LET US GO ALONE AND SEEK THE PLACE OURSELVES HE THEN BADE ME DISGUISE MYSELF AND WE BOTH SLIPPED OUT OF A GARDEN DOOR WHICH OPENED ON TO THE CEMETERY
WAS THE MAN'S ACT IN ANY WAY EXCUSABLE STRONG MEN AND WOMEN OFTEN SIN THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF THOSE WHOM THEY LOVE AND ADMIRE ARE THEY THEREBY EXCUSED WHAT NATURAL IMPULSES IMPELLED THE WOMAN TO DISOBEY THE DIVINE COMMAND
THE ORIGIN NATURE AND CONSEQUENCES OF SIN THIS METHOD OF TEACHING WAS SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH JESUS USED FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PARABLE OF DIVES AND LAZARUS THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL
BUT I MADE THEM IN PERSON IT WAS ALL OF NO USE HE CHERISHED AN UNDYING HATRED TOWARDS ME AND LOST NO OCCASION OF SHOWING IT HAVING ONCE GOT ME IN HIS POWER I FELT HE COULD SHOW NO MERCY AND I WAS RIGHT
MADAM THIS IS THE WAY THAT WILL LEAD YOU DOWN TO THE SPOT WHICH I TOLD YOU OF
SO SAYING WITH ONE SWEEP OF HIS SABRE HE CUT OFF A HAND OF THE PRINCESS
DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM IN YOUR POWER BUT I REFUSE TO OBEY YOUR CRUEL COMMAND I SEE SAID THE GENIUS THAT YOU HAVE BOTH MADE UP YOUR MINDS TO BRAVE ME BUT I WILL GIVE YOU A SAMPLE OF WHAT YOU MAY EXPECT
AFTER A JOURNEY WHICH LASTED SOME MONTHS I ARRIVED AT LENGTH AT THE GATES OF THIS CITY IT WAS SUNSET AND I PAUSED FOR A LITTLE TO LOOK ABOUT ME AND TO DECIDE WHICH WAY TO TURN MY STEPS I WAS STILL DEBATING ON THIS SUBJECT WHEN I WAS JOINED BY THIS OTHER CALENDER
SO WE TRIED TO OVERAWE THEM BY INFORMING THEM WHO WE WERE AND WHITHER WE WERE GOING THE ROBBERS HOWEVER ONLY LAUGHED AND DECLARED THAT WAS NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS AND WITHOUT MORE WORDS ATTACKED US BRUTALLY
NOW THE SULTAN OF THE INDIES CURIOUS TO SEE A YOUNG PRINCE WITH SUCH STRANGE TASTES SENT AN AMBASSADOR TO MY FATHER LADEN WITH RICH PRESENTS AND A WARM INVITATION TO VISIT HIS COURT
I THEREFORE LOST NO TIME IN TELLING MY UNCLE EVERYTHING I KNEW AND I OBSERVED THAT EVEN BEFORE I HAD ENDED HIS SORROW APPEARED TO BE LIGHTENED A LITTLE MY DEAR NEPHEW HE SAID YOUR STORY GIVES ME SOME HOPE
BUT THE LOOK OF GRATITUDE SHE GAVE ME SHOOK MY COURAGE AND I FLUNG THE SABRE TO THE EARTH I SHOULD NOT DESERVE TO LIVE I SAID TO THE GENIUS IF I WERE SUCH A COWARD AS TO SLAY A LADY WHO IS NOT ONLY UNKNOWN TO ME BUT WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT HALF DEAD HERSELF
IN A FEW DAYS I HAD QUITE RECOVERED FROM THE HARDSHIPS I HAD UNDERGONE AND THEN THE TAILOR KNOWING THAT IT WAS THE CUSTOM FOR THE PRINCES OF OUR RELIGION TO LEARN A TRADE OR PROFESSION SO AS TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES
I FOUND MYSELF IN A COUNTRY THAT WAS QUITE NEW TO ME AND DARED NOT RETURN TO THE MAIN ROAD LEST I SHOULD AGAIN FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE ROBBERS LUCKILY MY WOUND WAS ONLY A SLIGHT ONE AND AFTER BINDING IT UP AS WELL AS I COULD I WALKED ON FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
BUT IF HE REALLY IS A STRANGER TO ME SHE REPLIED
WHERE NO MISGIVING IS RELY UPON THE GENIAL SENSE OF YOUTH GLAD HEARTS WITHOUT REPROACH OR BLOT WHO DO THY WORK AND KNOW IT NOT
EVEN FOR THE LEAST DIVISION OF AN HOUR HAVE I BEEN SO BEGUILED AS TO BE BLIND TO MY MOST GRIEVOUS LOSS THAT THOUGHT'S RETURN WAS THE WORST PANG THAT SORROW EVER BORE SAVE ONE

MIGHT BE CLAIMED WITH PERHAPS EQUAL JUSTICE FOR A NARRATIVE OR DESCRIPTIVE SELECTION WHILST WITH REFERENCE ESPECIALLY TO BALLADS AND SONNETS THE EDITOR CAN ONLY STATE THAT HE HAS TAKEN HIS UTMOST PAINS TO DECIDE WITHOUT CAPRICE
RATHER IN THE WHOLE THAN IN THE PARTS SUCH AND OTHER SUCH CANONS HAVE BEEN ALWAYS STEADILY REGARDED HE MAY HOWEVER ADD THAT THE PIECES CHOSEN AND A FAR LARGER NUMBER REJECTED
THIS INVERSION OBVIOUSLY TOOK PLACE IN THE DREAM WHEN GOETHE ATTACKED THE YOUNG MAN WHICH IS ABSURD WHILST ANY ONE HOWEVER YOUNG CAN TO DAY EASILY ATTACK THE GREAT GOETHE
DISCLOSES ANOTHER SIDE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DREAM CONTENT AND DREAM THOUGHTS JUST AS ONE ELEMENT OF THE DREAM LEADS TO ASSOCIATIONS WITH SEVERAL DREAM THOUGHTS SO AS A RULE THE ONE DREAM THOUGHT REPRESENTS MORE THAN ONE DREAM ELEMENT
EACH ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE DREAM CONTENT IS OVERDETERMINED BY THE MATTER OF THE DREAM THOUGHTS
AS A SEPARATE OUTLET FOR A SERIES OF IMPRESSIONS WHEN THERE IS NOTHING IN COMMON BETWEEN THE DREAM THOUGHTS THE DREAM WORK TAKES THE TROUBLE TO CREATE A SOMETHING IN ORDER TO MAKE A COMMON PRESENTATION FEASIBLE IN THE DREAM THE SIMPLEST WAY TO APPROXIMATE TWO DREAM THOUGHTS
THE MISCONCEPTION OF THE DREAM THOUGHTS TO WHICH IT GIVES RISE IS MERELY SUPERFICIAL AND OUR FIRST PIECE OF WORK IN ANALYZING A DREAM IS TO GET RID OF THESE EARLY ATTEMPTS AT INTERPRETATION THE MOTIVES FOR THIS PART OF THE DREAM WORK ARE EASILY GAUGED
I CAN BUILD UP A PERSON BY BORROWING ONE FEATURE FROM ONE PERSON AND ONE FROM ANOTHER OR BY GIVING TO THE FORM OF ONE THE NAME OF ANOTHER IN MY DREAM I CAN ALSO VISUALIZE ONE PERSON
OR REPLACED BY TWO DIFFERENT LONG PORTIONS OF DREAMS ONE AFTER THE OTHER THIS PRESENTATION IS FREQUENTLY A REVERSED ONE THE BEGINNING OF THE DREAM BEING THE DEDUCTION AND ITS END THE HYPOTHESIS
THE DREAM CONTENT DOES NOT HOWEVER CONSIST EXCLUSIVELY OF SCENES BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES SCATTERED FRAGMENTS OF VISUAL IMAGES CONVERSATIONS AND EVEN BITS OF UNCHANGED THOUGHTS
THIS FINAL ELABORATION OF THE DREAM IS DUE TO A REGARD FOR INTELLIGIBILITY A FACT AT ONCE BETRAYING THE ORIGIN OF AN ACTION WHICH BEHAVES TOWARDS THE ACTUAL DREAM CONTENT JUST AS OUR NORMAL PSYCHICAL ACTION BEHAVES TOWARDS SOME PROFFERED
GOETHE DIED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO AS HIS ATTACK UPON MISTER M MUST OF COURSE HAVE TAKEN PLACE BEFORE MISTER M MUST HAVE BEEN THEN A VERY YOUNG MAN IT SEEMS TO ME PLAUSIBLE THAT HE WAS EIGHTEEN
THE FIRST DREAM THOUGHTS WHICH ARE UNRAVELLED BY ANALYSIS FREQUENTLY STRIKE ONE BY THEIR UNUSUAL WORDING THEY DO NOT APPEAR TO BE EXPRESSED IN THE SOBER FORM WHICH OUR THINKING PREFERS
IT WILL BE PERHAPS TO THE POINT IF WE INSTANCE IN THE BRIEFEST WAY THE MEANS OF DRAMATIZATION WHICH ARE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE DREAM WORK FOR THE REPETITION OF THE DREAM THOUGHTS IN THE PECULIAR LANGUAGE OF THE DREAM
HAS A DIFFERENT CENTER OF INTEREST FROM THAT OF THE DREAM IDEAS IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE DREAM CONTENT THE MAIN SCENE APPEARS AS IF A WOMAN WISHED TO MAKE ADVANCES TO ME IN THE DREAM IDEA THE CHIEF INTEREST RESTS ON THE DESIRE TO ENJOY DISINTERESTED LOVE
HAVING REGARD TO THE ORIGIN OF THIS STUFF THE TERM REGRESSION CAN BE FAIRLY APPLIED TO THIS PROCESS
THEREBY RISKING ITS FALSIFICATION WHILST IN FACT THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MISCONCEPTIONS ARISE IF THE DREAM CAN BE CORRELATED WITH NOTHING FAMILIAR EVERY ONE IS AWARE THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO LOOK AT ANY SERIES OF UNFAMILIAR SIGNS
WE ARE COMPELLED TO ASSUME THAT SUCH TRANSFORMATION OF SCENE HAS ALSO TAKEN PLACE IN INTRICATE DREAMS THOUGH WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT HAS ENCOUNTERED ANY POSSIBLE DESIRE THE DREAM INSTANCED AT THE COMMENCEMENT WHICH WE ANALYZED SOMEWHAT THOROUGHLY
ONE WHICH IS INDEED NOT SHARED BY EVERY DREAM I SHALL NOT TREAT THIS POSITION OF THE DREAM WORK EXHAUSTIVELY
IT DEVELOPS NO FANCIES OF ITS OWN IT JUDGES NOTHING DECIDES NOTHING IT DOES NOTHING BUT PREPARE THE MATTER FOR CONDENSATION AND DISPLACEMENT AND REFASHIONS IT FOR DRAMATIZATION
WITH WE ALL MAINTAIN UNWARRANTABLE VIOLENCE MISTER M HAS NATURALLY BEEN RUINED BY THIS ATTACK HE COMPLAINS VERY BITTERLY OF THIS AT A DINNER PARTY BUT HIS RESPECT FOR GOETHE HAS NOT DIMINISHED THROUGH THIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
WHICH HAS BEEN REPLACED BY SOMETHING INDIFFERENT WITH WHICH IT HAS ENTERED INTO ABUNDANT ASSOCIATIONS
SOME POINT OF CONTACT ARE REPLACED IN THE DREAM CONTENT BY A MIXED IMAGE WHERE THE DISTINCT GERM CORRESPONDS TO WHAT IS COMMON AND THE INDISTINCT SECONDARY MODIFICATIONS TO WHAT IS DISTINCTIVE
ELISE L EXAMPLE SHOWS ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET A HUSBAND LATER INDEED ONE A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER IF I HAD BUT WAITED
NOR MUST WE OVERLOOK THE ABSURDITY OF THE DREAM THAT TWO PERSONS SHOULD TAKE THREE TICKETS FOR THE THEATER NOW FOR THE DREAM IDEAS IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE MARRIED SO EARLY I NEED NOT HAVE BEEN IN SO GREAT A HURRY
NO SCHILLER COMPOSED THAT ET CETERA WE HAVE NOT EXHAUSTED OUR VALUATION OF THE DREAM WORK IN ADDITION TO CONDENSATION DISPLACEMENT AND DEFINITE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PSYCHICAL MATTER WE MUST ASCRIBE TO IT YET ANOTHER ACTIVITY
OF THESE MIXED IMAGES BY ANALYSIS IS OFTEN THE QUICKEST WAY TO AN INTERPRETATION OF THE DREAM THUS I ONCE DREAMT THAT I WAS SITTING WITH ONE OF MY FORMER UNIVERSITY TUTORS ON A BENCH WHICH WAS UNDERGOING A RAPID CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT AMIDST OTHER BENCHES
WITHOUT ANY POETICAL OR LITERARY INTERESTS
FORCES ITSELF UPON ME HERE IT WAS TO THIS MAN THAT SOME YOUTHFUL COLLEAGUES IN THE HOSPITAL
WHEN I FOLLOW OUT THE DREAM THOUGHTS CLOSELY I EVER FIND ONLY SCORN AND CONTEMPT AS CORRELATED WITH THE DREAM'S ABSURDITY IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE DISCOVERY OF A CRACKED SHEEP'S SKULL ON THE LIDO IN VENICE GAVE GOETHE THE HINT FOR THE SO CALLED VERTEBRAL THEORY OF THE SKULL
THAN IN CONDENSATION ALTHOUGH THE WORK OF DISPLACEMENT MUST BE HELD MAINLY RESPONSIBLE IF THE DREAM THOUGHTS ARE NOT REFOUND OR RECOGNIZED IN THE DREAM CONTENT UNLESS THE MOTIVE OF THE CHANGES BE GUESSED IT IS ANOTHER AND MILDER KIND OF TRANSFORMATION
THE MORE DEEPLY YOU GO INTO THE ANALYSIS THE MORE DEEPLY YOU ARE IMPRESSED BY IT
THE DREAM IS ABLE TO EMBODY THIS MATTER INTO A SINGLE SCENE IT UPHOLDS A LOGICAL CONNECTION AS APPROXIMATION IN TIME AND SPACE JUST AS THE PAINTER WHO GROUPS ALL THE POETS FOR HIS PICTURE OF PARNASSUS WHO THOUGH THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN ALL TOGETHER ON A MOUNTAIN PEAK
EXCLAIMING NATURE NATURE HAD GONE OUT OF HIS MIND THE DOCTORS CONSIDERED THAT THE EXCLAMATION AROSE FROM A STUDY OF GOETHE'S BEAUTIFUL ESSAY
THAT THE DREAM WORK SHOULD UNHESITATINGLY USE THE DOUBLE MEANING OF THE WORD IS CERTAINLY REMARKABLE AMPLE EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN HOWEVER THAT THE OCCURRENCE IS QUITE USUAL
OR WHETHER AN ELECTORAL ASSEMBLY SHOULD BE FORMED FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF PROCEEDING TO THE NOMINATION OF A PRESIDENT THE AMERICANS CHOSE THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE FROM A BELIEF THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE RETURNED TO MAKE THE LAWS
POSSESSED THE DIRECTING AUTHORITY IF THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM WERE ADOPTED IN EUROPE THE CONDITION OF MOST OF THE MONARCHICAL STATES WOULD BE CHANGED AT EVERY NEW ELECTION IN AMERICA THE PRESIDENT EXERCISES A CERTAIN INFLUENCE ON STATE AFFAIRS BUT HE DOES NOT CONDUCT THEM
THE THIRD EXPEDIENT WAS THEREFORE ADOPTED AND IT WAS AGREED THAT THE VOTES SHOULD BE TRANSMITTED SEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE
BUT THE DIFFICULTY WAS TO OBTAIN THIS MAJORITY WITHOUT AN INTERVAL OF DELAY WHICH IT WAS MOST IMPORTANT TO AVOID IT RARELY HAPPENS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN AT ONCE COLLECT THE MAJORITY OF THE SUFFRAGES OF A GREAT PEOPLE
AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IF NONE OF THE CANDIDATES HAS A MAJORITY
IT IS AN ESTABLISHED AXIOM IN EUROPE THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL KING CANNOT PERSEVERE IN A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH IS OPPOSED BY THE TWO OTHER BRANCHES OF THE LEGISLATURE
HE NO LONGER GOVERNS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE STATE BUT FOR THAT OF HIS RE ELECTION HE DOES HOMAGE TO THE MAJORITY AND INSTEAD OF CHECKING ITS PASSIONS AS HIS DUTY COMMANDS HIM TO DO HE FREQUENTLY COURTS ITS WORST CAPRICES
ALTHOUGH ITS CONSEQUENCES MAY BE DIFFERENT AND ITS RESULTS MORE OR LESS EXTENSIVE WHENCE I AM LED TO CONCLUDE THAT FRANCE WITH ITS KING IS NEARER AKIN TO A REPUBLIC THAN THE UNION WITH ITS PRESIDENT IS TO A MONARCHY
THE CONTRAST WOULD HAVE BEEN RENDERED STILL MORE STRIKING I HAVE REMARKED THAT THE AUTHORITY OF THE PRESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES IS ONLY EXERCISED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A PARTIAL SOVEREIGNTY
IT WAS EXPOSED TO ALL THE CHANCES OF CIVIL WAR RESULTING FROM SO MARTIAL A MODE OF PROCEEDING BESIDES THE DANGERS OF THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM IN ITSELF THE POLISH LAWS WHICH SUBJECTED THE ELECTION OF THE SOVEREIGN TO THE VETO OF A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL
AT LEAST THERE IS ALWAYS SOME ONE TO CONDUCT THEM WELL OR ILL ACCORDING TO HIS CAPACITY IN ELECTIVE STATES ON THE CONTRARY THE WHEELS OF GOVERNMENT CEASE TO ACT AS IT WERE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AT THE APPROACH OF AN ELECTION
THE PREPONDERATING POWER IS VESTED IN THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WHOLE NATION THE POLITICAL MAXIMS OF THE COUNTRY DEPEND THEREFORE ON THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE NOT ON THE PRESIDENT ALONE
AND THIS DIFFICULTY IS ENHANCED IN A REPUBLIC OF CONFEDERATE STATES WHERE LOCAL INFLUENCES ARE APT TO PREPONDERATE
THE REVOLUTIONS OF POLAND WERE NOT SOLELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM IN GENERAL BUT TO THE FACT THAT THE ELECTED MONARCH WAS THE SOVEREIGN OF A POWERFUL KINGDOM BEFORE WE CAN DISCUSS THE ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGES OF THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM
THAT HE HAS THE POWER OF PARALYZING ITS INFLUENCE IF IT OPPOSES HIS DESIGNS HE REQUIRES THE ASSISTANCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLIES TO MAKE THE LAW BUT THOSE ASSEMBLIES STAND IN NEED OF HIS AID TO EXECUTE IT
TO THE SUFFERINGS WHICH THEY HAVE PERSONALLY UNDERGONE IT IS OPPRESSION AND NOT THE EXTENT OF THE EXECUTIVE POWER WHICH EXCITES THEIR HOSTILITY AND THEY ATTACK THE FORMER WITHOUT PERCEIVING HOW NEARLY IT IS CONNECTED WITH THE LATTER
THE PRESIDENT HAS NO OPPORTUNITY OF EXERCISING HIS GREAT PREROGATIVES IN THE PREROGATIVES HE EXERCISES HE IS WEAK IF THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT IS FEEBLER IN AMERICA THAN IN FRANCE THE CAUSE IS MORE ATTRIBUTABLE
ARE OBLIGED TO CHOOSE A CITIZEN WHO HAS ALREADY BEEN DESIGNATED BY A POWERFUL MINORITY OF THE SPECIAL ELECTORS IT IS BY THIS HAPPY EXPEDIENT THAT THE RESPECT WHICH IS DUE TO THE POPULAR VOICE IS COMBINED WITH THE UTMOST CELERITY OF EXECUTION
TO RETAIN HIS PLACE BEYOND THE FIRST YEAR WHICH SUCCEEDED HIS ELECTION IT IS SOMETIMES MADE A SUBJECT OF COMPLAINT THAT IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHIES OF EUROPE THE FATE OF THE HUMBLER SERVANTS OF AN ADMINISTRATION
AND THE NAME OF THE CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY IS PUT FORWARD AS THE SYMBOL AND PERSONIFICATION OF THEIR THEORIES FOR THESE REASONS PARTIES ARE STRONGLY INTERESTED IN GAINING THE ELECTION NOT SO MUCH WITH A VIEW TO THE TRIUMPH OF THEIR PRINCIPLES UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE PRESIDENT ELECT
TO ANOTHER AUTHORITY THE FIRST TWO OF THESE ALTERNATIVES INDEPENDENTLY OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR RESULTS WERE LIKELY TO DELAY THE FINAL DECISION AND TO PERPETUATE AN AGITATION WHICH MUST ALWAYS BE ACCOMPANIED WITH DANGER
BUT SEVERAL PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO LOSE THE MAJORITY IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO ABANDON THE SUPREME POWER AND WITHOUT INFLICTING A SERIOUS EVIL UPON SOCIETY
I REMARKED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER THAT THE DANGERS OF THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM APPLIED TO THE HEAD OF THE STATE ARE AUGMENTED OR DECREASED BY THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PEOPLE WHICH ADOPTS IT HOWEVER THE FUNCTIONS OF THE EXECUTIVE POWER MAY BE RESTRICTED
HIS SINCERE AND ZEALOUS CO OPERATION IS NO DOUBT USEFUL BUT IT IS NOT INDISPENSABLE IN THE CARRYING ON OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS ALL HIS IMPORTANT ACTS ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE
COMPOSED OF ONLY SIX THOUSAND MEN HE COMMANDS THE FLEET BUT THE FLEET RECKONS BUT FEW SAIL HE CONDUCTS THE FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE UNION BUT THE UNITED STATES ARE A NATION WITHOUT NEIGHBORS
I MIGHT HAVE GONE ON TO SHOW THAT THE POWER OF THE KING'S GOVERNMENT IN FRANCE EXCEEDS ITS NATURAL LIMITS HOWEVER EXTENSIVE THEY MAY BE AND PENETRATES IN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS INTO THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRIVATE INTERESTS
AND THOSE WHICH IT WOULD CARRY INTO EFFECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY
PRESENTED NO REAL EMBARRASSMENTS TO THE NATION NEVERTHELESS
BUT THE DECISION OF THE QUESTION BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DOES NOT NECESSARILY OFFER AN IMMEDIATE SOLUTION OF THE DIFFICULTY FOR THE MAJORITY OF THAT ASSEMBLY MAY STILL BE DOUBTFUL
WERE SOMETIMES PROLONGED SO MUCH AS TO ENDANGER THE WELFARE OF THE STATE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE ELECTORS SHOULD ALL VOTE UPON THE SAME DAY
ASSUREDLY THE GOOD OLD PRIEST HAD NEVER BEEN SO LODGED IN HIS MODEST PARSONAGE THE PARSONAGE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR PADRE PASSANHA HE OUGHT TO HAVE A CHAPEL THE CHAPEL THEN WAS BUILT IN THE CENTER OF THE JANGADA AND A LITTLE BELL SURMOUNTED IT
IT WAS SMALL ENOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY AND IT COULD NOT HOLD THE WHOLE OF THE CREW BUT IT WAS RICHLY DECORATED
PADRE PASSANHA BENITO LINA FRAGOSO CYBELE AND SOME OF THE SERVANTS INDIAN OR NEGRO OF THE FAZENDA FRAGOSO COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF STILL HE WENT AND HE CAME HE RAN DOWN THE BANK AND RAN UP THE PLATEAU
A GREAT HOMOGENEOUS SANDSTONE STRETCHES DECLINING RAPIDLY AND ON ITS SIDES ARE CARVED INNUMERABLE BASINS WHICH ARE NOW FILLED WITH PURE WATER AND WE CALL THIS THE THOUSAND WELLS
THEN WE GO AROUND AMONG THE PEOPLE AND SELECT THE ARTICLES OF POTTERY STONE IMPLEMENTS INSTRUMENTS AND UTENSILS MADE OF BONE HORN SHELL ARTICLES OF CLOTHING AND ORNAMENT BASKETS TRAYS AND MANY OTHER THINGS
ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK I SET A COUPLE OF MEN TO PREPARE A HASTY LUNCH CALL UP ALL HANDS AND WE SADDLE PACK EAT OUR LUNCH AND START OFF TO THE SOUTHWEST TO REACH THE MOENKOPI WHERE THERE IS A LITTLE RANCHERIA OF INDIANS
IN THE BOW WAS THE CABIN OF THE PILOT WE SAY IN THE BOW AND NOT AT THE STERN WHERE THE HELMSMAN IS GENERALLY FOUND IN NAVIGATING UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A RUDDER IS OF NO USE LONG OARS HAVE NO EFFECT ON A RAFT OF SUCH DIMENSIONS
TO HUNT US UP SOME OF THE NATIVES AND BRING THEM TO THIS POOL WHEN WE ARRIVE WE ARE DISAPPOINTED IN NOT FINDING THEM ON HAND BUT A LITTLE LATER HALF A DOZEN MEN COME IN WITH THE INDIAN MESSENGER THEY ARE SURLY FELLOWS AND SEEM TO BE DISPLEASED AT OUR COMING
SOME OF EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS IT WAS HOPED WOULD FIGURE IN TURN ON THE TABLES OF THE MASTER AND HIS MEN AND SO EACH DAY SHOOTING AND FISHING WERE TO BE REGULARLY INDULGED IN FOR BEVERAGES THEY HAD A GOOD STORE OF THE BEST THAT COUNTRY PRODUCED CAYSUMA OR
IT IS MADE OF CORN MEAL IN SHEETS AS THIN AND LARGE AS FOOLSCAP PAPER IN THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE OVEN THE TOP OF WHICH IS A GREAT FLAT STONE AND THE GOOD HOUSEWIFE BAKES HER BREAD IN THIS MANNER
SOON THIS IS OVER AND THE WOMEN ALL FILE DOWN THE LADDER INTO THE KIVA AND THE MEN STRIP OFF THEIR MASKS AND ARRANGE THEMSELVES ABOUT THE PLAZA EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WISH BUT AS IF IN SHARP EXPECTANCY
WE EMPLOY OUR TIME IN MAKING A COLLECTION OF THE ARTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN FIRST WE DISPLAY TO THEM OUR STOCK OF GOODS COMPOSED OF KNIVES NEEDLES AWLS SCISSORS PAINTS DYESTUFFS LEATHER AND VARIOUS FABRICS IN GAY COLORS
FROM ONE FOURTH TO ONE HALF A MILE IN WIDTH ON RARE OCCASIONS A STREAM FLOWS DOWN THIS VALLEY BUT NOW SAND DUNES STRETCH ACROSS IT
WITH ONLY LIGHT POLES SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF FOLIAGE THE AIR CIRCULATED FREELY THROUGHOUT THESE OPEN CONSTRUCTIONS AND SWUNG THE HAMMOCK SUSPENDED IN THE INTERIOR AND THE NATIVES AMONG WHOM WERE THREE OR FOUR COMPLETE FAMILIES WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN
EARLY IN THE MORNING WE PASS UP A BEAUTIFUL VALLEY TO THE SOUTH AND TURN WESTWARD ONTO A GREAT PROMONTORY FROM THE SUMMIT OF WHICH THE GRAND CANYON IS IN VIEW ITS DEEP GORGE CAN BE SEEN TO THE WESTWARD FOR FIFTY OR SIXTY MILES
AND BY DIGGING INTO THE SAND THIS SWEET WATER IS FOUND
THE OTHER TOWNS ARE VERY OLD THEIR FOUNDATION DATES BACK MANY CENTURIES SO WE GATHER FROM THIS TALK THE PEOPLE OF HANO ALSO SPEAK A RADICALLY DISTINCT LANGUAGE BELONGING TO ANOTHER STOCK OF TRIBES THEY FORMERLY LIVED ON THE RIO GRANDE
NECKS SHOULDERS AND BREASTS OF THE WOMEN THEN WITH HIS FINGER AS A BRUSH HE DECORATED THEM OVER THIS GROUNDWORK WHICH WAS OF YELLOW WITH MANY FIGURES IN VARIOUS COLORS FROM THAT TIME TO DAYLIGHT THE THREE WOMEN REMAINED IN THE KIVA
WHEREVER IT DROPS IT IN THIS MANNER A SAND BANK IS FORMED NOW THE EFFECT OF THIS SAND BAR IS TO TURN THE COURSE OF THE RIVER AGAINST THE WALL OR BANK AND AS IT UNLOADS IN ONE PLACE IT CUTS IN ANOTHER BELOW AND LOADS ITSELF AGAIN
OR MEDICINE ORDERS AS THEY ARE SOMETIMES CALLED BUT THIS INSTITUTION HAS BEEN NOWHERE DEVELOPED MORE THOROUGHLY THAN AMONG THE PUEBLO INDIANS OF THIS REGION
WHO HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT THE FAZENDA HE HAD KNOWN THE CHILDREN FROM BIRTH HE HAD BAPTIZED THEM EDUCATED THEM AND HOPED TO GIVE EACH OF THEM THE NUPTIAL BLESSING THE AGE OF THE PADRE DID NOT ALLOW OF HIS EXERCISING HIS IMPORTANT MINISTRY ANY LONGER
IN A LARGE CENTRAL ROOM WE GATHER AND THE FOOD IS PLACED BEFORE US A STEW OF GOAT'S FLESH IS SERVED IN EARTHEN BOWLS AND EACH ONE OF US IS FURNISHED WITH A LITTLE EARTHEN LADLE THE BREAD IS A GREAT NOVELTY TO ME
THE PEOPLE WITH GREAT DILIGENCE GATHER SNAKES FROM THE ROCKS AND SANDS OF THE REGION ROUND ABOUT AND BRING THEM TO THE KIVA OF ONE OF THEIR CLANS IN GREAT NUMBERS BY SCORES AND HUNDREDS MOST OF THESE SNAKES ARE QUITE HARMLESS BUT RATTLESNAKES ABOUND
ALL DAY LONG OUR WAY IS OVER RED HILLS WITH A BOLD LINE OF CLIFFS ON OUR LEFT A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE REACH A GREAT SPRING AND HERE WE ARE TO CAMP FOR THE NIGHT FOR THE REGION BEYOND US IS UNKNOWN AND WE WISH TO ENTER IT WITH A GOOD DAY BEFORE US
I DID NOT KNOW WHEN WRITING THE NOTES THAT THIS WAS THE GRANDEST VIEW THAT CAN BE OBTAINED OF THE REGION FROM FREMONT'S PEAK TO THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA BUT I DID REALIZE THAT THE SCENE BEFORE ME WAS AWFUL SUBLIME AND GLORIOUS
HAD COME TO ASSIST AT THE INTERESTING SPECTACLE THEY WERE ALL KEENLY ON THE WATCH AND SILENCE REIGNED OVER THE IMPRESSIONABLE CROWD
THE JANGADA WAS MOORED TO THE BANK WITH SOLID CABLES SO THAT IT COULD NOT BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE CURRENT WHEN IT FLOATED OFF QUITE A TRIBE FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED INDIANS WITHOUT COUNTING THE POPULATION OF THE VILLAGE
THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER SHEET OF PAPER BREAD IS MADE IN LIKE MANNER AND PILED ON THE TRAY I NOTICE THAT THE PASTE STANDS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BOWLS AND THAT SHE TAKES FROM ONE BOWL AND THEN ANOTHER IN ORDER
ALL DAY LONG WE PASS BY THE FOOT OF THE ECHO CLIFFS WHICH ARE IN FACT THE CONTINUATION OF THE VERMILION CLIFFS
ADDRESS'D MY SELF THUS LIKE AN ORACLE TO THE KING OF KINGS
NO SOONER HAD I REACH'D THE BORDERS OF ARABIA BUT A NOTORIOUS FREE BOOTER ONE ARBOGAD BY NAME PICK'D ME UP AS I WAS STROLLING ALONG AND SOLD ME TO SOME MERCHANTS
BUT SAID NOTHING TO ANY ONE WHOMSOEVER ZADIG WAS TO BE EXECUTED THE NEXT DAY AND SHE HAD ONLY A FEW HOURS LEFT TO CARRY HER PROJECT INTO EXECUTION
AS TO BURN ONE CORNER OF THE CRUST WHEREUPON SHE GAVE HIS POST TO HER FAVOURITE DWARF AND MADE HER FOP OF A PAGE THE KEEPER OF HIS MAJESTY'S GREAT SEAL AND CONFIDENCE
WHILST THEY BUSY IN THEIR FRUITLESS SEARCH SAID THE BEAUTEOUS ASTARTE I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE SERIES OF SORROWS WHICH I HAVE UNDERGONE SINCE LAST WE PARTED
WHO BY THIS TIME WAS NOT ONLY RECONCIL'D TO LIVING A LITTLE LONGER BUT HAD SOME TASTE FOR THE PLEASURES OF LIFE AND KNEW THAT SHE WAS ENTIRELY INDEBTED TO ZADIG FOR IT
ON HIS WHOLE FRATERNITY CONVEN'D A SET OF PETTY DOCTORS AND APOTHECARIES WHO WERE HIS VASSALS AND ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO HIS INTEREST TO FIND OUT SOME SURE WAYS AND MEANS
WHO CONVEY'D ME TO YONDER CASTLE THE MAGNIFICENT RESIDENCE OF THE EMIR OGUL HE PURCHAS'D ME AT ALL ADVENTURES
SHE MADE USE OF THE MOST COSTLY PERFUMES AND DREST HERSELF TO THE UTMOST ADVANTAGE TO RENDER HER CHARMS AS CONSPICUOUS AS POSSIBLE
THE BOWELS OF HIS GOD AND SET UP AT THE HEAD OF A VERY POWERFUL PARTY
WHAT A NECK IS HERE AS YELLOW AS SAFFRON AN OBJECT NOT WORTH REGARDING THEN SHE DISPLAY'D SUCH A SNOWY PANTING BOSOM
EVERY NOW AND THEN A SIGH BURST OUT AS IF HER HEART WERE BREAKING IN HER HAND SHE HELD A LITTLE WAND OR ROD WITH WHICH SHE WAS TRACING OUT SOME CHARACTERS ON THE DRY SAND THAT LAY
OF THE JUSTLY ADMIR'D ASTARTE AND REFLECTING ON HIS OWN STARS THAT SO OBSTINATELY DARTED DOWN THEIR MALIGNANT RAYS AND CONTINU'D DAILY TO TORMENT HIM WHAT
PERFECTLY THUNDER STRUCK AND AS MOTIONLESS AS A STATUE AT LAST IN A SOFT FAULTRING TONE HE BROKE SILENCE O GENEROUS LADY SAID HE
AND UNSPOTTED VIRTUE I HAD ALWAYS HEARD SAY THAT HEAV'N BESTOW'D ON PERSONS OF MY RANK SUCH A PECULIAR MARK OF MAJESTY AND GRANDEUR
WHEN HE HAS GORG'D HIMSELF SO UNMERCIFULLY THAT HE IS READY TO BURST HIS CHIEF PHYSICIAN CAN PERSUADE HIM TO TAKE ANY THING FOR HIS RELIEF THO HE LAUGHS AT HIM AND DESPISES HIS ADVICE WHEN HE'S WELL AND SOBER
I SAW HIM PROSTRATE ON THE PAVEMENT BEFORE THE STATUE WHEREIN I WAS ENCLOS'D IMPLORING THE GODS TO SHOW'R DOWN THEIR CHOICEST BLESSINGS ON HIS BEAUTEOUS MISSOUF I
BY WHICH YOU WILL BE SOLE LADY REGENT YOU WILL OBLIGE ME TO THE LAST DEGREE BY YOUR FRIENDLY ASSISTANCE AND AT THE SAME TIME GET RID OF A RIVAL
SO PRECIOUS AS YOURS IS I AM A PHYSICIAN BY PROFESSION I FLEW TO YOUR PALACE ON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE DANGEROUS SITUATION YOU WERE IN
MISSOUF CAJOL'D WITH THE HINT CAME INTO MY MEASURES DIRECTLY SHE TOOK CARE TO SEND ME PACKING FORTHWITH WITH NO OTHER ATTENDANT THAN AN OLD EGYPTIAN SLAVE
IS IN A VERY BAD STATE OF HEALTH AND HIS FIRST PHYSICIAN HAS ORDER'D HIM AS A SPECIFIC TO EAT A BASILISK BOIL'D IN ROSE WATER AND AS THAT ANIMAL IS VERY HARD TO BE CATCH'D
I HAVE BEEN SINCE INFORM'D THAT HER NAME IN THE EGYPTIAN LANGUAGE SIGNIFIES THE FAIR COQUET AND IN EFFECT SHE WAS SO
TO COMPLY WITH SO PREPOSTEROUS A REQUEST SHE PERSECUTED HIM WITHOUT MERCY NOTHING WOULD SERVE HER TURN IN THE NEXT PLACE BUT HIS MAJESTY'S GRAND MASTER OF THE HORSE MUST MAKE HER
ALL THE FAVOUR I REQUEST IS THE RELEASE OF ONE OF YOUR BABYLONISH SLAVES WHO HAS BEEN IN YOUR HIGHNESS'S RETINUE FOR SOME TIME AND I
AND WAITED WITH THE UTMOST IMPATIENCE FOR THE UP RISING
AS FOR MY OWN PART I HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE OVER POWER'D LIKEWISE AND TAKEN PRISONER BY AN HYRCANIAN PARTY WHO BROUGHT ME INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE YOUNG PRINCE
THAT YOUNG LADIES LIKE ME SELDOM KILL'D THEMSELVES AND THAT THEY WERE MADE FOR ENJOYMENT AND THEN TURN'D UPON HIS HEEL
IN THE MEAN TIME HIS APOTHECARY
AND HAVE BROUGHT A BASILISK WITH ME DISTILL'D IN ROSE WATER I CAN HAVE NO HOPES OF THE HONOUR OF YOUR BED IN CASE I SUCCEED IN MY APPLICATION
RECLIN'D ON THE GRASS AND ENTIRELY DISENGAG'D HER STATURE SEEM'D MAJESTIC BUT HER FACE WAS COVER'D WITH A VAIL AND HER EYES WERE FIXT AS ONE AT HER LOOKING GLASS ON THE RIVER
BUT APPROACHING NEARER AND PERCEIVING VERY DISTINCTLY
IF IT CAN BE SET IMMEDIATELY ABOUT I WILL BE SO MUCH THE AUTHOUR'S FRIEND AS NOT TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH MERE SOLICITATIONS IN HIS FAVOUR I PROPOSE IF MY CALCULATION BE NEAR THE TRUTH
BUT IF WE WALK WITH HOPE IN THE MID DAY SUN OF REVELATION OUR TEMPER AND DISPOSITION WILL BE SUCH THAT THE COMFORTS AND ENJOYMENTS IN OUR WAY WILL BE RELISHED
DEAR SIR THOUGH I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM YOU UPON YOUR ENTRANCE INTO A NEW STATE OF LIFE AT A NEW PLACE YET RECOLLECTING NOT WITHOUT SOME DEGREE OF SHAME THAT I OWE YOU A LETTER UPON AN OLD ACCOUNT
THAT YOU WILL FAVOUR ME WITH A LETTER TO MORROW THAT I MAY KNOW WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO ALLOW HIM THAT HE MAY EITHER PART WITH IT TO YOU OR FIND OUT WHICH I DO NOT EXPECT SOME OTHER WAY MORE TO HIS SATISFACTION I HAVE ONLY TO ADD
HE LEAVES NO EXAMPLE TO HIS FRIENDS NOR BEQUEATHS ANY HONOUR TO HIS DESCENDANTS THE ONLY REASON WHY WE LAMENT A SOLDIER'S DEATH IS THAT WE THINK HE MIGHT HAVE LIVED LONGER
OLDHAM'S THOUGH LESS ELEGANT IS MORE JUST NOTHING IN POVERTY SO ILL IS BORNE AS ITS EXPOSING MEN TO GRINNING SCORN
AND WOULD FROM SINCERE BENEVOLENCE IMPRESS UPON ALL WHO HONOUR THIS BOOK WITH A PERUSAL THAT UNTIL A STEADY CONVICTION IS OBTAINED THAT THE PRESENT LIFE IS AN IMPERFECT STATE AND ONLY A PASSAGE TO A BETTER
OF DEPARTED SPIRITS A DOCTRINE WHICH IT IS A MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THAT HE HIMSELF EVER POSITIVELY HELD
WHETHER TO SEE LIFE AS IT IS WILL GIVE US MUCH CONSOLATION I KNOW NOT BUT THE CONSOLATION WHICH IS DRAWN FROM TRUTH IF ANY THERE BE IS SOLID AND DURABLE THAT WHICH MAY BE DERIVED FROM ERROUR MUST BE LIKE ITS ORIGINAL
IF WE COMPLY WITH THE DIVINE SCHEME OF PROGRESSIVE IMPROVEMENT AND ALSO THAT IT IS A PART OF THE MYSTERIOUS PLAN OF PROVIDENCE
AND OUR LEXICOGRAPHER IS IN GREAT DISTRESS HE SAYS THE BOY IS A SICKLY LAD OF A DELICATE FRAME AND PARTICULARLY SUBJECT TO A MALADY IN HIS THROAT WHICH RENDERS HIM VERY UNFIT FOR HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE
BUT AM VERY WILLING THAT IF YOU PLEASE HE SHOULD HAVE A PART IN IT AS HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE MORE DILIGENT TO DISPERSE AND PROMOTE IT IF YOU CAN SEND ME WORD TO MORROW WHAT I SHALL SAY TO HIM I WILL SETTLE MATTERS AND BRING THE POEM WITH ME FOR THE PRESS
THAT AS I AM SENSIBLE I HAVE TRANSCRIBED IT VERY COARSELY WHICH AFTER HAVING ALTERED IT I WAS OBLIGED TO DO I WILL IF YOU PLEASE TO TRANSMIT THE SHEETS FROM THE PRESS CORRECT IT FOR YOU
LIKE THAT EMPLOYED IN LEVELLING GROUND CAN BE PERCEIVED ONLY BY THOSE WHO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF COMPARING THE ORIGINAL WITH THE ALTERED COPY WHAT WE CERTAINLY KNOW TO HAVE BEEN DONE BY HIM IN THIS WAY
WHICH IS AN EXQUISITE REMARK ON THE GALLING MEANNESS AND CONTEMPT ANNEXED TO POVERTY JOHNSON'S IMITATION IS OF ALL THE GRIEFS THAT HARASS THE DISTREST SURE THE MOST BITTER IS A SCORNFUL JEST
YOU MUST THEREFORE BE ENABLED TO DISCHARGE PETTY DEBTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE LEISURE WITH SECURITY TO STRUGGLE WITH THE REST NEITHER THE GREAT NOR LITTLE DEBTS DISGRACE YOU
THO MUCH CONCERN'D TO LOSE MY DEAR OLD FRIEND THERE IS ONE PASSAGE IN THE ORIGINAL BETTER TRANSFUSED BY OLDHAM THAN BY JOHNSON NIL HABET INFELIX PAUPERTAS DURIUS IN SE
I SHOULD BE SORRY TO THINK THAT WHAT ENGROSSES THE ATTENTION OF MY FRIEND SHOULD HAVE NO PART OF MINE
MAY NOT PERHAPS HAVE MADE LIFE APPEAR TO HIM MORE INSIPID AND UNHAPPY THAN IT GENERALLY IS FOR I AM SURE THAT HE HAD LESS ENJOYMENT FROM IT THAN I HAVE
YET THIS CAUSE OF GRIEF IS COMMON TO MANY OTHER KINDS OF DEATH WHICH ARE NOT SO PASSIONATELY BEWAILED THE TRUTH IS THAT EVERY DEATH IS VIOLENT WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF ACCIDENT EVERY DEATH WHICH IS NOT GRADUALLY BROUGHT ON BY THE MISERIES OF AGE
MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROCURE THE DISCHARGE OF HIS LACQUEY IT WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS TO SAY MORE ON THE SUBJECT WHICH I LEAVE TO YOUR OWN CONSIDERATION
BUT I CANNOT LET SLIP THIS OPPORTUNITY OF DECLARING THAT I AM WITH THE MOST INVIOLABLE ESTEEM AND ATTACHMENT DEAR SIR YOUR AFFECTIONATE OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT T SMOLLET MISTER WILKES WHO UPON ALL OCCASIONS HAS ACTED AS A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN
DEAR SIR YOU WILL RECEIVE THIS BY MISTER BARETTI A GENTLEMAN PARTICULARLY INTITLED TO THE NOTICE AND KINDNESS OF THE PROFESSOR OF POESY HE HAS TIME BUT FOR A SHORT STAY AND WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE IT FILLED UP WITH AS MUCH AS HE CAN HEAR AND SEE
IN RECOMMENDING ANOTHER TO YOUR FAVOUR I OUGHT NOT TO OMIT THANKS FOR THE KINDNESS WHICH YOU HAVE SHEWN TO MYSELF HAVE YOU ANY MORE NOTES ON SHAKSPEARE I SHALL BE GLAD OF THEM
HE WAS HUMBLE ENOUGH TO DESIRE MY ASSISTANCE ON THIS OCCASION THOUGH HE AND I WERE NEVER CATER COUSINS AND I GAVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT I WOULD MAKE APPLICATION TO MY FRIEND MISTER WILKES WHO PERHAPS BY HIS INTEREST WITH DOCTOR HAY AND MISTER ELLIOT
AND OF THE WHOLE BUT A SMALL PART IS TROUBLESOME SMALL DEBTS ARE LIKE SMALL SHOT THEY ARE RATTLING ON EVERY SIDE AND CAN SCARCELY BE ESCAPED WITHOUT A WOUND GREAT DEBTS ARE LIKE CANNON OF LOUD NOISE BUT LITTLE DANGER
THAT HE IS MUCH EXCELLED BY THE ENGLISH JUVENAL
WHICH HE DESIRES TO HAVE A SHARE IN IT BEING AS HE SAYS A CREDITABLE THING TO BE CONCERNED IN I KNEW NOT WHAT ANSWER TO MAKE TILL I HAD CONSULTED YOU NOR WHAT TO DEMAND ON THE AUTHOUR'S PART
WHILE HE IS SO CAUTIOUS AS NOT TO AVOW IT TO BE HIS OWN PRODUCTION
AND AS IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE MONTH OF MAY IN THAT YEAR IT IS EVIDENT THAT MUCH TIME WAS NOT EMPLOYED IN PREPARING IT FOR THE PRESS
CONSISTING IN ADAPTING JUVENAL'S SENTIMENTS TO MODERN FACTS AND PERSONS IT WILL WITH THOSE ADDITIONS VERY CONVENIENTLY MAKE FIVE SHEETS AND SINCE THE EXPENSE WILL BE NO MORE I SHALL CONTENTEDLY INSURE IT AS I MENTIONED IN MY LAST
AND WILL NOT INCOMMODE MY DEAR LUCY BY COMING TO LICHFIELD WHILE HER PRESENT LODGING IS OF ANY USE TO HER I HOPE IN A FEW DAYS TO BE AT LEISURE AND TO MAKE VISITS WHITHER I SHALL FLY IS MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE
UNTIL THEY COOL AND RETAIN THE CURL HOW OFTEN IS THIS OPERATION REPEATED TWO OR THREE TIMES THE FURNACE EACH TIME BEING MADE LESS HOT THE TEA IS THEN PLACED IN THE STORE HOUSES OR PACKED IN CHESTS
OF WHAT USE IS BARK BARK IS USEFUL FOR MANY THINGS OF THE BARK OF WILLOWS AND LINDEN TREES ROPES ARE SOMETIMES MADE THE SIAMESE MAKE THEIR CORDAGE OF THE COCOA TREE BARK AS DO MOST OF THE ASIATIC AND AFRICAN NATIONS

THE PLANT WHICH BEARS IT IS ABOUT FIVE OR SIX FEET HIGH AT THE TOP OF THE FRUIT GROWS A RED FLOWER WHICH WHEN FULL BLOWN FALLS UPON IT THE FRUIT THEN APPEARS FULL OF LITTLE RED INSECTS HAVING VERY SMALL WINGS THESE ARE THE COCHINEALS
OF A HOT BITING TASTE AROMATIC FRAGRANT HAVING AN AGREEABLE ODOR WHAT IS CINNAMON AN AGREEABLE AROMATIC SPICE THE BARK OF A TREE OF THE LAUREL KIND
THE LIQUOR THUS OBTAINED IS LEFT TO SETTLE THE CLEAR LIQUOR IS THEN DRAWN OFF AND WHAT REMAINS IS FORMED INTO GRAINS BY BEING PASSED THROUGH METAL DISHES WITH NUMEROUS SMALL HOLES IT IS NEXT DRIED BY THE ACTION OF HEAT
ON A FLOOR OF HARD EARTH OR STONE LYE A LIQUOR MADE FROM WOOD ASHES OF GREAT USE IN MEDICINE BLEACHING
EXPERT NIMBLE DO THEY LEAVE THEIR CANOES IN THE WATER ON THEIR RETURN FROM A VOYAGE NO THEY DRAW THEM ASHORE HANG THEM UP BY THE TWO ENDS AND LEAVE THEM TO DRY
A RENOWNED ROMAN GENERAL IS THE WOOD OF THE CHERRY TREE USEFUL IT IS USED IN CABINET MAKING FOR BOXES AND OTHER ARTICLES WHAT IS BARK THE EXTERIOR PART OF TREES
A NATIVE OF ARABIA THE COFFEE TREE IS AN EVERGREEN AND MAKES A BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE AT ALL TIMES OF THE YEAR BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN IN FLOWER AND WHEN THE BERRIES ARE RED WHICH IS USUALLY DURING THE WINTER IT IS ALSO CULTIVATED IN PERSIA
ALL VEGETABLES CONTAIN MORE OR LESS SUGAR BUT THE PLANT IN WHICH IT MOST ABOUNDS IS THE SUGAR CANE IN THE UNITED STATES A LARGE QUANTITY OF SUGAR IS PREPARED FROM THE SAP OF THE SUGAR MAPLE TREE
THE CORN OF SYRIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY SUPERIOR AND BY MANY CLASSED ABOVE THAT OF EGYPT FOR WHAT IS BARLEY GENERALLY USED IT IS VERY EXTENSIVELY USED FOR MAKING MALT FROM WHICH ARE PREPARED BEER ALE
AND FOR MAKING CARMINE A BRILLIANT RED USED IN PAINTING AND SEVERAL OF THE ARTS IS IT A PLANT NO IT IS AN INSECT THE FORM OF THE COCHINEAL IS OVAL
A D FIFTY FIVE WHAT IS THE MEANING OF A D
EXCELLENT TO EAT BUT TAKING IT OFF KILLS THE TREE THE COCOA IS A SPECIES OF PALM IS NOT THE INDIAN LIQUOR CALLED TODDY PRODUCED FROM THE COCOA TREE YES
YES ESPECIALLY THAT OF THE OAK BUT THE BEST OAK BARK IS USED IN TANNING WHAT IS CORK THE THICK SPONGY EXTERNAL BARK OF THE CORK TREE A SPECIES OF OAK
IT IS ALSO A NATIVE OF BOTH INDIES THE PIMENTO TREE IS A WEST INDIAN SPECIES OF MYRTLE IT GROWS TO THE HEIGHT OF TWENTY OR THIRTY FEET THE LEAVES ARE ALL OF A DEEP SHINING GREEN
COCOA TODDY CHERRIES BARK CORK COCHINEAL CLOVES CINNAMON AND CASSIA OF WHAT FORM IS THE TREE WHICH BEARS THOSE LARGE NUTS CALLED COCOA NUTS
WHICH IS DONE BY PLACING THE ROOTS IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN OR IN OVENS AFTER BEING DUG OUT OF THE GROUND QUANTITIES NOT ONLY OF THE DRIED ROOT BUT ALSO OF THE CANDIED SUGAR ARE IMPORTED WHAT ARE NUTMEGS
ITS TASTE IS WARM BITTERISH AND RATHER PUNGENT ITS SMELL AROMATIC IT IS USED BOTH IN FOOD AND MEDICINE AS THE NUTMEG AND ALSO YIELDS AN OIL PUNGENT OF A HOT
THE SEEDS FALL OUT AND DROPPING IN VARIOUS PLACES TAKE ROOT SPRING UP AND BECOME TREES PROPAGATED SPREAD EXTENDED MULTIPLIED WHAT ELSE IS OBTAINED FROM THIS TREE
YES EXTREMELY SO THEY STRIKE THE PADDLES WITH SUCH REGULARITY THAT THE CANOES SEEM TO FLY ALONG THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AT THE SAME TIME BALANCING THE VESSELS WITH THEIR BODIES TO PREVENT THEIR OVERTURNING DEXTEROUS
THE INHABITANTS OF CRETE AN ISLAND OF THE ARCHIPELAGO WHO WERE THE SICILIANS INHABITANTS OF SICILY THE LARGEST ISLAND OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA NOW A PART OF ITALY AND SEPARATED FROM THE MAINLAND
BY CAREFULLY GATHERING THE LEAVES ONE BY ONE WHILE THEY ARE YET SMALL YOUNG AND JUICY THEY ARE THEN SPREAD ON LARGE FLAT IRON PANS AND PLACED OVER SMALL FURNACES
IT IS TALL AND STRAIGHT WITHOUT BRANCHES AND GENERALLY ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET HIGH AT THE TOP ARE TWELVE LEAVES TEN FEET LONG AND HALF A FOOT BROAD ABOVE THE LEAVES GROWS A LARGE EXCRESCENCE IN THE FORM OF A CABBAGE
HE LASHED HIMSELF INTO AN AGONY OF FIERCE JEALOUSY HE THOUGHT OF THAT LOOK THAT ATTITUDE HOW HE WOULD HAVE LAID HIS LIFE AT HER FEET FOR SUCH TENDER GLANCES SUCH FOND DETENTION HE MOCKED AT HIMSELF
AND THAT IT SUITED MISS HALE'S PURPOSE TO RECALL HER REJECTED LOVER POOR MARGARET THERE WAS PERHAPS SO MUCH TRUTH IN THE SUSPICION AS THIS THAT MISSUS THORNTON WAS THE MOTHER OF ONE WHOSE REGARD SHE VALUED AND FEARED TO HAVE LOST
SHE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY ANNOYED AT MARGARET'S WAY OF BEHAVING SHE DID NOT CARE ENOUGH FOR HER FOR THAT SHE HAD TAKEN MISSUS THORNTON'S REMONSTRANCE TO THE FULL AS KEENLY TO HEART AS THAT LADY EXPECTED AND MARGARET'S PASSION AT ONCE MOLLIFIED HER VISITOR FAR MORE THAN ANY SILENCE OR RESERVE COULD HAVE DONE
IMPLYING ANY MORE SERIOUS IMPUTATION THAN THAT SHE NOW NEEDS THE COUNSEL OF SOME KIND AND GENTLE WOMAN YOU PROMISED MISSUS HALE TO BE THAT WOMAN NO SAID MISSUS THORNTON I AM HAPPY TO SAY I DID NOT PROMISE KINDNESS AND GENTLENESS
IF HE HAD RUNG THE LODGE BELL OR EVEN GONE UP TO THE HOUSE TO ASK FOR HIM
AND THIS THOUGHT UNCONSCIOUSLY ADDED TO HER NATURAL DESIRE OF PLEASING ONE WHO WAS SHOWING HER KINDNESS BY HER VISIT MISSUS THORNTON STOOD UP TO GO BUT YET SHE SEEMED TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY
THESE GOOD PEOPLE I SEE ARE AT DINNER SAID HE CLOSING THE DOOR OF THE PORTER'S LODGE
YOU CAN SAY NOTHING MORE MISSUS THORNTON I DECLINE EVERY ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY MYSELF FOR ANYTHING YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO LEAVE THE ROOM AND SHE SWEPT OUT OF IT WITH THE NOISELESS GRACE OF AN OFFENDED PRINCESS
WAS NOT A MAN IN ALL THAT CROWD FOR WHOM SHE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE AS MUCH FAR MORE READILY THAN FOR HIM HE SHARED WITH THE MOB IN HER DESIRE OF AVERTING BLOODSHED FROM THEM BUT THIS MAN THIS HIDDEN LOVER SHARED WITH NOBODY
WHATE'ER YE SAY THINK WHAT YE MAY YE'S GET NA WORD FRAE ME SCOTCH BALLAD IT WAS NOT MERELY THAT MARGARET WAS KNOWN TO MISTER THORNTON TO HAVE SPOKEN FALSELY THOUGH SHE IMAGINED THAT FOR THIS REASON ONLY WAS SHE SO TURNED IN HIS OPINION
SAID HE AND HIS TONE WAS ROUGHER THAN BEFORE IT IS MEN SUCH AS THIS THOUGHT HE WHO INTERRUPT COMMERCE AND INJURE THE VERY TOWN THEY LIVE IN
I MIGHT AS WELL PUT A FIREBRAND INTO THE MIDST OF THE COTTON WASTE HIGGINS TURNED AWAY THEN THE RECOLLECTION OF BOUCHER CAME OVER HIM AND HE FACED ROUND WITH THE GREATEST CONCESSION HE COULD PERSUADE HIMSELF TO MAKE
THE VERY FALSEHOOD THAT STAINED HER WAS A PROOF HOW BLINDLY SHE LOVED ANOTHER THIS DARK SLIGHT ELEGANT HANDSOME MAN WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS ROUGH AND STERN AND STRONGLY MADE
NOT ONE WORD AGAINST YOU IF HE HAS KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING WHICH SHOULD MAKE YOU SOB SO HE KEEPS IT TO HIMSELF MARGARET'S FACE WAS STILL HIDDEN IN HER HANDS THE FINGERS OF WHICH WERE WET WITH TEARS MISSUS THORNTON WAS A LITTLE MOLLIFIED COME MISS HALE
INADVERTENTLY WITHOUT REMONSTRATING AT LEAST WITHOUT OFFERING ADVICE WHETHER YOU TOOK IT OR NOT MARGARET STOOD BEFORE HER BLUSHING LIKE ANY CULPRIT WITH HER EYES DILATING AS SHE GAZED AT MISSUS THORNTON
THE INCOMPETENCE OF THE IRISH HANDS WHO HAD TO BE TRAINED TO THEIR WORK AT A TIME REQUIRING UNUSUAL ACTIVITY WAS A DAILY ANNOYANCE IT WAS NOT A FAVOURABLE HOUR FOR HIGGINS TO MAKE HIS REQUEST BUT HE HAD PROMISED MARGARET TO DO IT AT ANY COST
BUT MY SON I AM SORRY TO SAY CONFIRMED HER STORY IT WAS INDISCREET TO SAY THE LEAST MANY A YOUNG WOMAN HAS LOST HER CHARACTER BEFORE NOW MARGARET'S EYES FLASHED FIRE THIS WAS A NEW IDEA THIS WAS TOO INSULTING
MISTER THORNTON HAS TOLD YOU NO MISS HALE SAID MISSUS THORNTON HER TRUTHFULNESS CAUSING HER TO ARREST THE CONFESSION MARGARET WAS ON THE POINT OF MAKING THOUGH HER CURIOSITY WAS ITCHING TO HEAR IT STOP MISTER THORNTON HAS TOLD ME NOTHING
WHAT SORT OF A MAN YOU REJECTED THIS MILTON MANUFACTURER HIS GREAT TENDER HEART SCORNED AS IT WAS SCORNED SAID TO ME ONLY LAST NIGHT GO TO HER I HAVE GOOD REASON TO KNOW THAT SHE IS IN SOME STRAIT
UPON MY WORD YOU DON'T THINK SMALL BEER OF YOURSELF
SHE SNORTED SCORNFULLY OVER THE PICTURE OF THE BEAUTY OF HER VICTIM HER JET BLACK HAIR HER CLEAR SMOOTH SKIN HER LUCID EYES WOULD NOT HELP TO SAVE HER ONE WORD OF THE JUST AND STERN REPROACH
SHE SAYS SHE MUST LEAVE US THAT HER LOVER'S DEATH HAS SO AFFECTED HER SPIRITS SHE CAN'T GIVE HER HEART TO HER WORK VERY WELL I SUPPOSE OTHER COOKS ARE TO BE MET WITH THAT'S SO LIKE A MAN IT'S NOT MERELY THE COOKING
IN THE FIRST PLACE AS IT IS NOT MANY YEARS SINCE I MYSELF WAS A DRAPER'S ASSISTANT THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF A GROCER'S ASSISTANT NOTICING ANY ACT DOES NOT ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THE ACT TO ME
CAN'T STAY NOW MY MAN I'M TOO LATE AS IT IS
WORST THEY COULD SAY OF ME IS THAT I DID WHAT I THOUGHT BEST EVEN TO MY OWN WRONG YOU'D BETTER GO AND TRY THEM THEN AND SEE WHETHER THEY'LL GIVE YOU WORK I'VE TURNED OFF UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED OF MY BEST HANDS FOR NO OTHER FAULT THAN FOLLOWING YOU AND SUCH AS YOU
AND YET SHE COULD NOT MIGHT NOT GIVE ANY EXPLANATION MISSUS THORNTON GREW IMPATIENT I SHALL BE SORRY TO BREAK OFF AN ACQUAINTANCE BUT FOR FANNY'S SAKE AS I TOLD MY SON IF FANNY HAD DONE SO WE SHOULD CONSIDER IT A GREAT DISGRACE
CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT PROMISES FULFILLED THEN PROUDLY PROUDLY UP SHE ROSE
I AM BUT UNCOUTH AND HARD BUT I WOULD NEVER HAVE LED YOU INTO ANY FALSEHOOD FOR ME THE MORE MISSUS THORNTON THOUGHT OVER WHAT HER SON HAD SAID IN PLEADING FOR A MERCIFUL JUDGMENT FOR MARGARET'S INDISCRETION THE MORE BITTERLY SHE FELT INCLINED TOWARDS HER
SHE CLEARED HER THROAT AND BEGAN MISS HALE I HAVE A DUTY TO PERFORM I PROMISED YOUR POOR MOTHER THAT AS FAR AS MY POOR JUDGMENT WENT I WOULD NOT ALLOW YOU TO ACT IN ANY WAY WRONGLY OR SHE SOFTENED HER SPEECH DOWN A LITTLE HERE
HE CROSSED TO THE PORTER'S LODGE HOW LONG HAS THAT MAN HIGGINS BEEN WAITING TO SPEAK TO ME
THEY MUST DEGRADE YOU IN THE LONG RUN IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD EVEN IF IN FACT THEY DO NOT LEAD YOU TO POSITIVE HARM FOR MY MOTHER'S SAKE SAID MARGARET IN A TEARFUL VOICE I WILL BEAR MUCH BUT I CANNOT BEAR EVERYTHING
AND THE RESPIRATION BECAME DEEP AND LABORIOUS I AM TOLD THAT IN POTOSI ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA STRANGERS DO NOT BECOME THOROUGHLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE ATMOSPHERE FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR THE INHABITANTS ALL RECOMMEND ONIONS FOR THE PUNA
THE TIDES WOULD BE ALWAYS WEARING DEEPER AND BROADER CHANNELS BETWEEN THEM AT THE PRESENT DAY EVEN IN THE MOST RETIRED SOUNDS ON THE COAST OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO THE CURRENTS IN THE TRANSVERSE BREAKS WHICH CONNECT THE LONGITUDINAL CHANNELS ARE VERY STRONG
IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IT IS FULLY AS MUCH OWING TO THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE AIR CONFOUNDING OBJECTS AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES AND LIKEWISE PARTLY TO THE NOVELTY OF AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF FATIGUE ARISING FROM A LITTLE EXERTION HABIT BEING THUS OPPOSED TO THE EVIDENCE OF THE SENSES
ARE NOW STEADILY AT WORK WEARING AWAY BOTH THE SOLID ROCK AND THESE ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS ALONG THE WHOLE LINE OF EVERY MAIN VALLEY AND SIDE VALLEY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE HERE TO GIVE THE REASONS
SUCH A BABEL OF CRIES ISSUED AT ONCE FROM THE SHIP EVERY ONE HALLOOING OUT
THE VEIN OCCURRED AT NO GREAT DISTANCE STANDING UP LIKE A WEDGE OF METAL THE MINERS ALSO TAKING A CROWBAR WITH THEM OFTEN WANDER ON SUNDAYS OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THIS SOUTH PART OF CHILE THE MEN WHO DRIVE CATTLE INTO THE CORDILLERA
EVIDENCE DERIVED FROM AN INCLINED STREAM OF LAVA AT THE EASTERN BASE OF THE PORTILLO
IT TURNED TO THE NORTH TOWARDS MENDOZA THE DISTANCE IS TWO VERY LONG DAYS JOURNEY OUR FIRST DAY'S JOURNEY WAS CALLED FOURTEEN LEAGUES TO ESTACADO AND THE SECOND SEVENTEEN TO LUXAN NEAR MENDOZA
RUDELY STRATIFIED AND GENERALLY OF CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS THESE FRINGES EVIDENTLY ONCE EXTENDED ACROSS THE VALLEYS AND WERE UNITED AND THE BOTTOMS OF THE VALLEYS IN NORTHERN CHILE WHERE THERE ARE NO STREAMS ARE THUS SMOOTHLY FILLED UP
SIR F HEAD MARVELS HOW MINES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS
THESE FROZEN MASSES DURING THE PROCESS OF THAWING
I AM SURE THAT THIS EXTREME CLEARNESS OF THE AIR GIVES A PECULIAR CHARACTER TO THE LANDSCAPE ALL OBJECTS APPEARING TO BE BROUGHT NEARLY INTO ONE PLANE AS IN A DRAWING OR PANORAMA THE TRANSPARENCY IS I PRESUME
AND THEREFORE THAT THE APPEARANCE OF A QUICKER DISINTEGRATION OF THE SOLID ROCK UNDER THE SNOW WAS DECEPTIVE WHATEVER
BUT WHEN WE REFLECT THAT THE CORDILLERA RUNNING IN A NORTH AND SOUTH LINE INTERCEPTS LIKE A GREAT WALL THE ENTIRE DEPTH OF THE LOWER ATMOSPHERIC CURRENT WE CAN EASILY SEE THAT THE TRADE WIND MUST BE DRAWN NORTHWARD FOLLOWING THE LINE OF MOUNTAINS TOWARDS THE EQUATORIAL REGIONS
WE DID NOT CROSS A SINGLE STREAM IN MANY PARTS THE GROUND WAS INCRUSTED WITH A SALINE EFFLORESCENCE HENCE WE HAD THE SAME SALT LOVING PLANTS WHICH ARE COMMON NEAR BAHIA BLANCA THE LANDSCAPE HAS A UNIFORM CHARACTER FROM THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN
HENCE DURING THE GRADUAL WEAR OF THE HILLS THEY PROJECT ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND
THE GENERAL COLOUR OF THE ROCK WAS DULLISH PURPLE AND THE STRATIFICATION VERY DISTINCT IF THE SCENERY WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL IT WAS REMARKABLE AND GRAND WE MET DURING THE DAY SEVERAL HERDS OF CATTLE WHICH MEN WERE DRIVING DOWN FROM THE HIGHER VALLEYS IN THE CORDILLERA
WE OUGHT NOT TO EXPECT ANY CLOSER SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE ORGANIC BEINGS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ANDES THAN ON THE OPPOSITE SHORES OF THE OCEAN IN BOTH CASES WE MUST LEAVE OUT OF THE QUESTION THOSE KINDS WHICH HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CROSS THE BARRIER
IF THIS BE SO AND I CANNOT DOUBT IT THE GRAND AND BROKEN CHAIN OF THE CORDILLERA INSTEAD OF HAVING BEEN SUDDENLY THROWN UP
THIS SIGN OF THE APPROACHING WINTER HURRIED OUR STEPS MORE THAN WAS CONVENIENT FOR GEOLOGIZING
THREE SPECIES OF ARMADILLO THE OSTRICH CERTAIN KINDS OF PARTRIDGES AND OTHER BIRDS NONE OF WHICH ARE EVER SEEN IN CHILE BUT ARE THE CHARACTERISTIC ANIMALS OF THE DESERT PLAINS OF PATAGONIA WE HAVE LIKEWISE MANY OF THE SAME
ONE OF THESE MEN WAS A THOROUGHBRED PAMPAS INDIAN HE WAS KEPT MUCH FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AS A BLOODHOUND TO TRACK OUT ANY PERSON WHO MIGHT PASS BY SECRETLY EITHER ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK SOME YEARS AGO A PASSENGER ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE DETECTION
THIS WIND MUST BE AN UPPER AND RETURN CURRENT
THE ROAR WHICH THE MAYPU MADE AS IT RUSHED OVER THE GREAT ROUNDED FRAGMENTS WAS LIKE THAT OF THE SEA AMIDST THE DIN OF RUSHING WATERS
OR RATHER THE MADRINA FOR ACCORDING TO THE MULETEER SHE IS THE CHIEF OBJECT OF AFFECTION THE FEELING HOWEVER IS NOT OF AN INDIVIDUAL NATURE FOR I BELIEVE I AM RIGHT IN SAYING THAT ANY ANIMAL WITH A BELL WILL SERVE AS A MADRINA IN A TROOP EACH ANIMAL CARRIES ON A LEVEL ROAD
MADE THE ONE DULL UNIFORM SOUND WERE ALL HURRYING IN ONE DIRECTION IT WAS LIKE THINKING ON TIME WHERE THE MINUTE THAT NOW GLIDES PAST IS IRREVOCABLE
AND NEXT MORNING IT WAS BOILED AGAIN BUT YET THE POTATOES WERE NOT COOKED
WHICH WAS PERHAPS PARTLY OWING TO THE PASSPORT WHICH THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAD GIVEN ME BUT I MUST EXPRESS MY ADMIRATION AT THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF ALMOST EVERY CHILENO IN THIS INSTANCE THE CONTRAST WITH THE SAME CLASS OF MEN IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES WAS STRONGLY MARKED
BY ARTICLES OF FOOD SUCH AS BREAD AND SUGAR BECOMING EXTREMELY HARD AND BY THE PRESERVATION OF THE SKIN AND PARTS OF THE FLESH OF THE BEASTS WHICH HAD PERISHED ON THE ROAD
HIRED PASTURE FOR THE ANIMALS AND BIVOUACKED IN THE CORNER OF THE SAME FIELD WITH THEM CARRYING AN IRON POT WE COOKED AND ATE OUR SUPPER UNDER A CLOUDLESS SKY AND KNEW NO TROUBLE MY COMPANIONS WERE MARIANO GONZALES WHO HAD FORMERLY ACCOMPANIED ME IN CHILE
INTERSECTED BY AN HORIZON LEVEL AS THAT OF THE OCEAN DURING THE NIGHT A HEAVY DEW FELL A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WE DID NOT EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE CORDILLERA THE ROAD PROCEEDED FOR SOME DISTANCE DUE EAST ACROSS A LOW SWAMP THEN MEETING THE DRY PLAIN
WAS IMPETUOUS AND EXTREMELY COLD ON EACH SIDE OF THE RIDGE WE HAD TO PASS OVER BROAD BANDS OF PERPETUAL SNOW WHICH WERE NOW SOON TO BE COVERED BY A FRESH LAYER WHEN WE REACHED THE CREST AND LOOKED BACKWARDS A GLORIOUS VIEW WAS PRESENTED
FOLLOW HER THE AFFECTION OF THESE ANIMALS FOR THEIR MADRINAS SAVES INFINITE TROUBLE IF SEVERAL LARGE TROOPS ARE TURNED INTO ONE FIELD TO GRAZE IN THE MORNING THE MULETEERS HAVE ONLY TO LEAD THE MADRINAS A LITTLE APART AND TINKLE THEIR BELLS
WHETHER OF SOLID ROCK OR SALT WATER FIVE A
THE WHOLE DISTANCE IS OVER A LEVEL DESERT PLAIN WITH NOT MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HOUSES THE SUN WAS EXCEEDINGLY POWERFUL AND THE RIDE DEVOID OF ALL INTEREST THERE IS VERY LITTLE WATER IN THIS TRAVERSIA
YOU'VE HANDLED MEN SHE SAID WITH RELUCTANT ADMIRATION
I AM COME INTO THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE HELP OF YOUR DAUGHTER FOR IT IS TOLD ME
THIS WILL BE THE MOST SCRUMPTIOUS EVENT IN MY LIFE I'M WILD ABOUT HER BUT I HAVEN'T ANY CLOTHES BURLINGAME WAVED HIS HANDS I KNEW I'D HEAR THAT YODEL EVE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SPEAK OF BUT SHE TRAVELLED A LOT
IF YOU GO AT IT RIGHT YOU TWO WILL REACT UPON EACH OTHER AS A TONIC KITTY REALIZED THAT THIS LITTLE JUNKET WAS THE VERY THING SHE NEEDED OPEN SPACES LONG WALKS IN WHICH TO THINK OUT HER PROBLEM SHE HURRIED HOME AND SPENT THE MORNING PACKING
SO WOULD I DO FOR I HAD LIEFER STRIFE AND DEBATE FELL IN KING MARK'S COURT RATHER THAN ARTHUR'S COURT FOR THE HONOUR OF BOTH COURTS BE NOT ALIKE AS TO THAT SAID SIR TRISTRAM I KNOW WELL BUT THAT THAT WAS DONE IT WAS FOR DESPITE OF ME
AND LIVING ON HIS MONEY THERE WAS A TOUCH OF HORROR IN THE SUGGESTION IT WAS TEARING HER TO PIECES THIS HIDDEN REPELLENCE AND YET THIS OCCULT OBJECTION WAS SO UTTERLY ABSURD
THE POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL ASPECTS OF THE POLYGLOT PEOPLES WHAT THEY WANTED WHAT THEY EXPECTED WHAT THEY NEEDED RACIAL ENMITIES THE BUGABOO OF THE UNDESIRABLE ALIEN WAS NO LONGER BOTHERING OFFICIAL HEADS IN WASHINGTON
AND HE CAME OVER THE SEA INTO ENGLAND AND THEN HE CAME INTO THE COURT OF KING ARTHUR AND THERE HE MET WITH SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAKE AND TOLD HIM OF THE MARRIAGE OF SIR TRISTRAM THEN SAID SIR LAUNCELOT
AND THERE CAME A MAN THAT SIR TRISTRAM AFOREHAND HAD SLAIN HIS BROTHER AND WHEN THIS MAN HAD FOUND HIM HE SHOT HIM THROUGH THE SHOULDER WITH AN ARROW AND SIR TRISTRAM LEAPT UP AND KILLED THAT MAN AND IN THE MEANTIME IT WAS TOLD KING MARK
AND SWARE A GREAT OATH THAT SHE SHOULD BE BURNT AND THE OTHER LADIES THEN THE BARONS GATHERED THEM TOGETHER AND SAID PLAINLY THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THOSE LADIES BURNT
THERE FOR TO TAKE HIS JUDGMENT AND SO HE WAS LED BOUNDEN WITH FORTY KNIGHTS AND WHEN SIR TRISTRAM SAW THAT THERE WAS NONE OTHER BOOT BUT NEEDS THAT HE MUST DIE THEN SAID HE FAIR LORDS
MARRY HER CHEAT HER AND STAY YOUNG GREEN STONES ACCURSED KITTY'S DAYS WERE PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT HER NIGHTS WERE SIEGES
IF HE'S GOT ANY PRIDE DIG IT UP GO AFTER EM HE HASN'T LOST ANY BLOOD NO SERIOUS BODY WOUND A CRACK ON THE CONK IT MIGHTA KILLED HIM IT DIDN'T HE DIDN'T WABBLE AN FALL DOWN SO MY DOPE IS RIGHT
KARLOV DRY WASHED HIS HANDS WE'LL SEND HIM ONE OF THE SAMPLES IF WE FAIL IN REGARD TO THE GIRL YOU SAY SHE ARRIVES DAILY AT THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE ABOUT NINE AND LEAVES BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX
AND THEN HE TOOK SUCH A THOUGHT SUDDENLY THAT HE WAS ALL DISMAYED AND OTHER CHEER MADE HE NONE BUT WITH CLIPPING AND KISSING AS FOR OTHER FLESHLY LUSTS SIR TRISTRAM NEVER THOUGHT NOR HAD ADO WITH HER SUCH MENTION MAKETH THE FRENCH BOOK
WHEN SIR TRISTRAM SAW THE PEOPLE DRAW UNTO HIM HE REMEMBERED HE WAS NAKED AND SPERD FAST THE CHAPEL DOOR AND BRAKE THE BARS OF A WINDOW
AND I'M WONDERING IF IT'S WORTH THE TROUBLE TO TRY TO FIND A WAY OUT A KNIGHT OF THE ROUND TABLE A PRINCE OF CHIVALRY WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF YOU SAW ONE IN SPATS AND A BLACK DERBY WHY ANSWERED BURLINGAME
I DO SAID THE EX PUGILIST I TOLD HIM TO EITHER HE WAS A FALSE ALARM OR HE'D ATTEMPT THE JOB EVEN IF HE FELL DOWN THE HULL THING IS THIS MAKE A GUY WANTA GET WELL AN HE'LL GET WELL
AND SHE SHALL HELP THEE THEN SIR TRISTRAM AND GOUVERNAIL GAT THEM SHIPPING AND SO SAILED INTO BRITTANY AND WHEN KING HOWEL WIST THAT IT WAS SIR TRISTRAM HE WAS FULL GLAD OF HIM SIR HE SAID
WE CANNOT VISUALIZE GOD BUT WE CAN SEE HIS STARS PINNED TO THE IMMEASURABLE SPACES SO KITTY SOUGHT HER WINDOW AND ADDED HER QUESTION TO THE COUNTLESS MILLIONS FORLORNLY WANDERING ABOUT UP THERE
REMEMBER YE NOT OF THE FALL YE DID GIVE ME ONCE AND AFTER YE REFUSED ME TO FIGHT ON FOOT THAT WAS NOT FOR FEAR I HAD OF YOU SAID SIR TRISTRAM BUT ME SHAMED AT THAT TIME TO HAVE MORE ADO WITH YOU FOR MESEEMED YE HAD ENOUGH
NATURALLY OFTEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM WHAT A REMARKABLE PIECE OF MACHINERY THE HUMAN BRAIN WAS HE COULD DIG UP ALL THIS DRY INFORMATION WITH THE PRECISE ACCURACY OF AN ECONOMIST ALL THE WHILE HIS ACTUAL THOUGHTS UPON KITTY
AND STILL THIS MYSTERIOUS REPELLENCE ROMANCE SHE WAS NOT SURRENDERING HER RIGHT TO THAT WHAT WAS A YEAR OUT OF HER LIFE IF AFTERWARD SHE WOULD BE IN COMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES FREE TO LOVE WHERE SHE WILLED
COMPLAINING HER OF THE UNTRUTH OF SIR TRISTRAM AND HOW HE HAD WEDDED THE KING'S DAUGHTER OF BRITTANY
GOIN T GIVE YOU A RUB THAT'LL START ALL YOUR MACHINERY WORKIN DOCILELY HAWKSLEY OBEYED HE WASN'T GOING TO LET THEM KNOW BUT THAT BED WAS GOING TO BE TOLERABLY WELCOME WELL SAID MISS FRANCES I DON'T SEE HOW HE DID IT
HAVING BEEN ADVISED BY CUTTY OVER THE WIRE AM I BEING FOLLOWED ANY MORE NOT THAT WE KNOW OF STILL YOU NEVER CAN TELL WHAT'S YOUR DESTINATION KITTY TOLD HIM
THAT I SHOULDN'T POSSESS A LITTLE HISTRIONIC ABILITY YOU'D THINK IT WOULD BE IN MY BLOOD TO ACT IT IS KITTY ONLY NOT TO MIMIC YOU'RE AN ACTRESS BUT THE BIG DRAMATIST WRITES YOUR BUSINESS FOR YOU
AND BY THE WAY THEY MET WITH A KNIGHT THAT WAS SENT FROM MORGAN LE FAY UNTO KING ARTHUR AND THIS KNIGHT HAD A FAIR HORN HARNESSED WITH GOLD AND THE HORN HAD SUCH A VIRTUE THAT THERE MIGHT NO LADY NOR GENTLEWOMAN DRINK OF THAT HORN BUT IF SHE WERE TRUE TO HER HUSBAND
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE AUTHOR'S FATHER WHO HAD AN INTEREST IN EXTENSIVE TRACTS OF LAND IN THIS WILDERNESS ARRIVED WITH A PARTY OF SURVEYORS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SCENE MET HIS EYE IS DESCRIBED BY JUDGE TEMPLE
CRIED THE AMUSED ALICE AND I TAKE HIM UNDER MY OWN ESPECIAL PROTECTION NAY THROW ASIDE THAT FROWN HEYWARD AND IN PITY TO MY LONGING EARS SUFFER HIM TO JOURNEY IN OUR TRAIN BESIDES SHE ADDED IN A LOW AND HURRIED VOICE
OTSEGO HAS NOW BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS DISTRICTS OF NEW YORK IT SENDS FORTH ITS EMIGRANTS LIKE ANY OTHER OLD REGION AND IT IS PREGNANT WITH INDUSTRY AND ENTERPRISE
AND EVEN THE DARK THOUGHTFUL EYE OF CORA
ALWAYS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AS IT IS THE MOST VALUABLE MODE OF CONVEYING KNOWLEDGE OF THIS NATURE HE WOULD HAVE MADE A FAR BETTER BOOK BUT IN COMMENCING TO DESCRIBE SCENES AND PERHAPS HE MAY ADD CHARACTERS
THE LITERAL FACTS ARE CHIEFLY CONNECTED WITH THE NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL OBJECTS AND THE CUSTOMS OF THE INHABITANTS THUS THE ACADEMY AND COURT HOUSE AND JAIL AND INN AND MOST SIMILAR THINGS
GOOD COMPANY WOULD SEEM CONSISTENT TO THE WISHES OF BOTH PARTIES YOU APPEAR TO POSSESS THE PRIVILEGE OF A CASTING VOTE RETURNED HEYWARD WE ARE THREE WHILE YOU HAVE CONSULTED NO ONE BUT YOURSELF EVEN SO THE FIRST POINT TO BE OBTAINED
WHO CONTINUED HIS STEADY PACE IN UNDISTURBED GRAVITY THE YOUNG MAN SMILED TO HIMSELF FOR HE BELIEVED HE HAD MISTAKEN SOME SHINING BERRY OF THE WOODS FOR THE GLISTENING EYEBALLS OF A PROWLING SAVAGE AND HE RODE FORWARD CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION
THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE AS TO THE SITE OF THE TALE THE HISTORY OF THIS DISTRICT OF COUNTRY
OF THE SAME CLASS IN LIFE WHO WOULD BE LESS ALIKE PERSONALLY THAN ELIZABETH TEMPLE
AND THE VEGETABLE WORLD IN THIS PERHAPS HE DOES NO MORE THAN ANY OTHER ENERGETIC AND IMAGINATIVE RACE WOULD DO BEING COMPELLED TO SET BOUNDS TO FANCY BY EXPERIENCE BUT
YOU MISTAKE THE PLACE OF REAL DANGER SAID HEYWARD IF ENEMIES HAVE REACHED THE PORTAGE AT ALL A THING BY NO MEANS PROBABLE AS OUR SCOUTS ARE ABROAD THEY WILL SURELY BE FOUND SKIRTING THE COLUMN
WHO MET WITH THE DEPLORABLE FATE MENTIONED IN A WORD
FOR IT IS CERTAIN THAT HEYWARD WHO POSSESSED A TRUE EYE FOR THE MERITS OF A HORSE WAS UNABLE WITH HIS UTMOST INGENUITY TO DECIDE BY WHAT SORT OF MOVEMENT HIS PURSUER WORKED HIS SINUOUS WAY ON HIS FOOTSTEPS
THERE IS SUFFICIENT HISTORICAL TRUTH IN THE PICTURE TO JUSTIFY THE USE THAT HAS BEEN MADE OF IT IN POINT OF FACT THE COUNTRY WHICH IS THE SCENE OF THE FOLLOWING TALE
IS ORIENTAL CHASTENED AND PERHAPS IMPROVED BY THE LIMITED RANGE OF HIS PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE HE DRAWS HIS METAPHORS FROM THE CLOUDS THE SEASONS THE BIRDS THE BEASTS
THAT THE INDIANS NOT ONLY GAVE DIFFERENT NAMES TO THEIR ENEMIES BUT FREQUENTLY TO THEMSELVES THE CAUSE OF THE CONFUSION WILL BE UNDERSTOOD IN THESE PAGES
IS TO KNOW ONE'S OWN MIND ONCE SURE OF THAT AND WHERE WOMEN ARE CONCERNED IT IS NOT EASY THE NEXT IS TO ACT UP TO THE DECISION I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO DO BOTH AND HERE I AM
FOR THE APPELLATION OF OUR FINEST SHEET OF WATER
OF ITS MISTRESS REPRESSED SEEK YOU ANY HERE
AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE SETTLEMENT BEGAN AND FROM THAT TIME TO THIS THE COUNTRY HAS CONTINUED TO FLOURISH
EXISTED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIS BEAUTIFUL SHEET OF WATER AS EVERY WORD UTTERED BY NATTY BUMPPO WAS NOT TO BE RECEIVED AS RIGID TRUTH WE TOOK THE LIBERTY OF PUTTING THE HORICAN INTO HIS MOUTH
BUT YOU SPEAK OF INSTRUCTION AND OF A PROFESSION ARE YOU AN ADJUNCT TO THE PROVINCIAL CORPS AS A MASTER OF THE NOBLE SCIENCE OF DEFENSE AND OFFENSE OR PERHAPS
SO INGENIOUS IS CONJECTURE THAT A PERSONAL RESEMBLANCE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED BETWEEN THE FICTITIOUS CHARACTER AND THE DECEASED RELATIVE IT IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE TWO FEMALES
FROM CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH AFTER THIS INTRODUCTION WILL BE OBVIOUS TO ALL THE AUTHOR HAS HAD MORE PLEASURE IN WRITING THE PIONEERS THAN THE BOOK WILL PROBABLY EVER GIVE ANY OF ITS READERS
WAS BURIED AND ABANDONED BY THE TROOPS ON THIS OCCASION AND IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND IN DIGGING THE CELLARS OF THE AUTHORS PATERNAL RESIDENCE SOON AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE WAR WASHINGTON
WHILE WRITING THIS BOOK FULLY A QUARTER OF A CENTURY SINCE IT OCCURRED TO US THAT THE FRENCH NAME OF THIS LAKE WAS TOO COMPLICATED THE AMERICAN TOO COMMONPLACE AND THE INDIAN TOO UNPRONOUNCEABLE
OR NORTHERLY INTO ONTARIO AND ITS OUTLET OTSEGO LAKE BEING THE SOURCE OF THE SUSQUEHANNA IS OF NECESSITY AMONG ITS HIGHEST LANDS THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY THE CLIMATE AS IT WAS FOUND BY THE WHITES
TO MAKE THEIR TREATIES AND OTHERWISE TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ALLIANCES AND WHICH REFERS THE NAME TO THIS PRACTICE AS THE INDIAN AGENT OF NEW YORK HAD A LOG DWELLING AT THE FOOT OF THE LAKE HOWEVER
THE AUTHOR HAS ELSEWHERE SAID THAT THE CHARACTER OF LEATHER STOCKING IS A CREATION RENDERED PROBABLE BY SUCH AUXILIARIES AS WERE NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THAT EFFECT
ILLNESS WHEN THE GAYETY WAS AT ITS HEIGHT HER PALLOR THE HANDKERCHIEF SHE CRUSHED AGAINST HER LIPS THE COUGH SHE SMOTHERED UNDER THE LAUGHTER WHILE GASTON KEPT PLAYING THE PIANO LIGHTLY IT ALL WRUNG MY HEART
FROM THAT MARVELLOUS WOMAN WHO WAS SHE HOW DID SHE FIRST COME TO THE CAVES OF KOR
AND NOW WHAT AM I TO SAY FURTHER I REALLY DO NOT KNOW
BUT TO HIS OWN LITTLE COUNTRY TO HIS FATHER'S FIELDS SLOPING DOWN TO THE RIVER AND TO THE OLD BEECH TREES WITH BROKEN TOPS CLERIC SAID HE THOUGHT VIRGIL WHEN HE WAS DYING AT BRINDISI MUST HAVE REMEMBERED THAT PASSAGE
I CAUGHT A FAINT ODOR OF VIOLET SACHET SO THAT'S LATIN IS IT IT LOOKS HARD
ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN WAS I THINK WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE HANDSOMEST YOUNG FELLOW I HAVE EVER SEEN HE WAS VERY TALL VERY BROAD AND HAD A LOOK OF POWER AND A GRACE OF BEARING THAT SEEMED AS NATIVE TO HIM AS IT IS TO A WILD STAG
EVERY SENTENCE MADE ONE OLDER AND WISER
SHE TOOK OFF HER JACKET AND SAT MORE AT EASE IN HER BLOUSE OF SOME SOFT FLIMSY SILK SHE WAS ALREADY AT HOME IN MY PLACE HAD SLIPPED QUIETLY INTO IT AS SHE DID INTO EVERYTHING
TO BRING THE MUSE INTO MY COUNTRY CLERIC HAD EXPLAINED TO US THAT PATRIA HERE MEANT NOT A NATION OR EVEN A PROVINCE
BUT A MONTH AGO I RECEIVED A LETTER AND TWO PACKETS ONE OF MANUSCRIPT
TO BE BRIEF AND COME TO MY BUSINESS I HAVE RECENTLY READ WITH MUCH INTEREST A BOOK OF YOURS DESCRIBING A CENTRAL AFRICAN ADVENTURE
THEY CALL HIM THE GREEK GOD BUT LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE HE'S VINCEY'S THAT'S THE GOD'S NAME GUARDIAN AND SUPPOSED TO BE FULL OF EVERY KIND OF INFORMATION
WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THEIR CLIENT AND MISTER LEO VINCEY HAD ALREADY LEFT THIS COUNTRY FOR THIBET AND THEY DID NOT AT PRESENT KNOW THEIR ADDRESS WELL THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY OF THE HISTORY ITSELF THE READER MUST JUDGE I GIVE IT HIM
AND HOW CRAZY MARY CHASED HER ROUND AND ROUND THE CORNFIELDS IT SEEMED TO ME WONDERFUL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GOT ON SO WELL IN THE WORLD CERTAINLY SHE HAD NO ONE BUT HERSELF TO THANK FOR IT
AFTER THE SECOND ACT I LEFT LENA IN TEARFUL CONTEMPLATION OF THE CEILING AND WENT OUT INTO THE LOBBY TO SMOKE AS I WALKED ABOUT THERE I CONGRATULATED MYSELF THAT I HAD NOT BROUGHT SOME LINCOLN GIRL WHO WOULD TALK DURING THE WAITS ABOUT THE JUNIOR DANCES
YOU WILL SEE IT STATED IN THIS MANUSCRIPT THAT I OR RATHER WE HAD MADE UP OUR MINDS NOT TO MAKE THIS HISTORY PUBLIC DURING OUR JOINT LIVES NOR SHOULD WE ALTER OUR DETERMINATION WERE IT NOT FOR A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAS RECENTLY ARISEN
THE DANISH LAUNDRY GIRLS AND THE THREE BOHEMIAN MARYS LENA HAD BROUGHT THEM ALL BACK TO ME IT CAME OVER ME AS IT HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE THE RELATION BETWEEN GIRLS LIKE THOSE AND THE POETRY OF VIRGIL
SINCE IT WAS EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE WOULD END IN A TRANSFER OF HER AFFECTIONS HE WAS ALTOGETHER TOO GOOD LOOKING AND WHAT IS MORE HE HAD NONE OF THAT CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONCEIT ABOUT HIM WHICH USUALLY AFFLICTS HANDSOME MEN
THAT MY WARD
GAMING TABLES WHERE THE MEN PLAYED WITH PILES OF GOLD AND A STAIRCASE DOWN WHICH THE GUESTS MADE THEIR ENTRANCE AFTER ALL THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED ROUND THE CARD TABLES AND YOUNG DUVAL HAD BEEN WARNED BY PRUDENCE MARGUERITE DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE WITH VARVILLE SUCH A CLOAK
HER ARMAND WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY YOUNG AND SLIGHT A HANDSOME YOUTH PERPLEXED IN THE EXTREME BUT WHAT DID IT MATTER I BELIEVED DEVOUTLY IN HER POWER TO FASCINATE HIM IN HER DAZZLING LOVELINESS I BELIEVED HER YOUNG
TO BEGIN WITH HE WAS SHORTISH RATHER BOW LEGGED VERY DEEP CHESTED AND WITH UNUSUALLY LONG ARMS HE HAD DARK HAIR AND SMALL EYES AND THE HAIR GREW RIGHT DOWN ON HIS FOREHEAD
HOW I LOVED TO HEAR HER LAUGH AGAIN IT WAS SO SOFT AND UNEXCITED AND APPRECIATIVE GAVE A FAVORABLE INTERPRETATION TO EVERYTHING WHEN I CLOSED MY EYES I COULD HEAR THEM ALL LAUGHING
HOW SURPRISED MISSUS BURDEN WOULD BE LENA LAUGHED SOFTLY AS SHE ROSE
WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE NECESSARY I INTRODUCE THE WORLD TO AYESHA AND THE CAVES OF KOR THE EDITOR P S THERE IS ON CONSIDERATION
MY WINDOW WAS OPEN AND THE EARTHY WIND BLOWING THROUGH MADE ME INDOLENT ON THE EDGE OF THE PRAIRIE WHERE THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN THE SKY WAS TURQUOISE BLUE LIKE A LAKE WITH GOLD LIGHT THROBBING IN IT HIGHER UP IN THE
BUT NOT SO MUCH AS HER CYNICISM IN THE LONG DIALOGUE WITH HER LOVER WHICH FOLLOWED
I THINK I'D BETTER GO HOME AND LOOK AFTER ANTONIA I SAID I THINK YOU HAD
AND HE MUST HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH THE THANKFULNESS OF A GOOD MAN I WAS THE FIRST TO BRING THE MUSE INTO MY COUNTRY WE LEFT THE CLASSROOM QUIETLY
HE WILL OBSERVE THAT SO FAR AS WE ARE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM THERE APPEARS TO BE NOTHING IN THE CHARACTER OF LEO VINCEY WHICH IN THE OPINION OF MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO ATTRACT AN INTELLECT SO POWERFUL AS THAT OF AYESHA HE IS NOT EVEN
UNDER THESE ALTERED CONDITIONS IT HAS BECOME A QUESTION WHETHER WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN WITHHOLDING FROM THE WORLD AN ACCOUNT OF A PHENOMENON WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE OF UNPARALLELED INTEREST MERELY BECAUSE OUR PRIVATE LIFE IS INVOLVED
A COUPLE OF JACK RABBITS RUN IN OFF THE PRAIRIE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE INNOCENT OF WHAT AWAITED THEM THAN WERE LENA AND I OUR EXCITEMENT BEGAN WITH THE RISE OF THE CURTAIN WHEN THE MOODY VARVILLE SEATED BEFORE THE FIRE INTERROGATED NANINE
WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE SCARAB THE ROYAL SON OF THE SUN
AS I THINK THE READER WILL BE ALSO AND AT ONCE MADE UP MY MIND TO PRESS ON WITH THE MATTER I WROTE TO THIS EFFECT TO MISTER HOLLY BUT A WEEK AFTERWARDS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THAT GENTLEMAN'S LAWYERS RETURNING MY OWN
SLIP DOWN GABRIEL LIKE A GOOD FELLOW AND SEE IF HE'S ALL RIGHT AND DON'T LET HIM UP IF HE'S SCREWED I'M SURE HE'S SCREWED I'M SURE HE IS GABRIEL WENT TO THE STAIRS AND LISTENED OVER THE BANISTERS HE COULD HEAR TWO PERSONS TALKING IN THE PANTRY THEN HE RECOGNISED FREDDY MALINS LAUGH HE WENT DOWN THE STAIRS NOISILY
RUBBING THE KNUCKLES OF HIS LEFT FIST BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS INTO HIS LEFT EYE GOOD EVENING FREDDY SAID AUNT JULIA FREDDY MALINS BADE THE MISSES MORKAN GOOD EVENING IN WHAT SEEMED AN OFFHAND FASHION BY REASON OF THE HABITUAL CATCH IN HIS VOICE AND THEN
EVERYBODY WHO KNEW THEM CAME TO IT MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY OLD FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY THE MEMBERS OF JULIA'S CHOIR ANY OF KATE'S PUPILS THAT WERE GROWN UP ENOUGH AND EVEN SOME OF MARY JANE'S PUPILS TOO NEVER ONCE HAD IT FALLEN FLAT
HE WAS STILL DISCOMPOSED BY THE GIRL'S BITTER AND SUDDEN RETORT IT HAD CAST A GLOOM OVER HIM WHICH HE TRIED TO DISPEL BY ARRANGING HIS CUFFS AND THE BOWS OF HIS TIE HE THEN TOOK FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET A LITTLE PAPER AND GLANCED AT THE HEADINGS HE HAD MADE FOR HIS SPEECH
GAVE MUSIC LESSONS TO BEGINNERS ON THE OLD SQUARE PIANO IN THE BACK ROOM LILY THE CARETAKER'S DAUGHTER DID HOUSEMAID'S WORK FOR THEM THOUGH THEIR LIFE WAS MODEST THEY BELIEVED IN EATING WELL THE BEST OF EVERYTHING DIAMOND BONE SIRLOINS
AND HERE'S MISTER BROWNE AND MISS FURLONG TAKE THEM IN JULIA WITH MISS DALY AND MISS POWER I'M THE MAN FOR THE LADIES SAID MISTER BROWNE PURSING HIS LIPS UNTIL HIS MOUSTACHE BRISTLED AND SMILING IN ALL HIS WRINKLES YOU KNOW MISS MORKAN THE REASON THEY ARE SO FOND OF ME IS
AND GLANCED AT HER SHE WAS A SLIM GROWING GIRL PALE IN COMPLEXION AND WITH HAY COLOURED HAIR THE GAS IN THE PANTRY MADE HER LOOK STILL PALER GABRIEL HAD KNOWN HER WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD AND USED TO SIT ON THE LOWEST STEP NURSING A RAG DOLL YES LILY HE ANSWERED
AUNT KATE WAS MORE VIVACIOUS HER FACE HEALTHIER THAN HER SISTER'S WAS ALL PUCKERS AND CREASES LIKE A SHRIVELLED RED APPLE AND HER HAIR BRAIDED IN THE SAME OLD FASHIONED WAY HAD NOT LOST ITS RIPE NUT COLOUR THEY BOTH KISSED GABRIEL FRANKLY
HE CONTINUED SCRAPING HIS FEET VIGOROUSLY WHILE THE THREE WOMEN WENT UPSTAIRS LAUGHING TO THE LADIES DRESSING ROOM A LIGHT FRINGE OF SNOW LAY LIKE A CAPE ON THE SHOULDERS OF HIS OVERCOAT
BOTH OF THEM KISSED GABRIEL'S WIFE SAID SHE MUST BE PERISHED ALIVE AND ASKED WAS GABRIEL WITH HER HERE I AM AS RIGHT AS THE MAIL AUNT KATE GO ON UP I'LL FOLLOW CALLED OUT GABRIEL FROM THE DARK
GABRIEL COLOURED AS IF HE FELT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER KICKED OFF HIS GOLOSHES AND FLICKED ACTIVELY WITH HIS MUFFLER AT HIS PATENT LEATHER SHOES HE WAS A STOUT TALLISH YOUNG MAN
HIS WHOLE SPEECH WAS A MISTAKE FROM FIRST TO LAST AN UTTER FAILURE JUST THEN HIS AUNTS AND HIS WIFE CAME OUT OF THE LADIES DRESSING ROOM HIS AUNTS WERE TWO SMALL PLAINLY DRESSED OLD WOMEN AUNT JULIA WAS AN INCH OR SO THE TALLER HER HAIR
THE NEXT THING HE'LL BUY ME WILL BE A DIVING SUIT GABRIEL LAUGHED NERVOUSLY AND PATTED HIS TIE REASSURINGLY WHILE AUNT KATE NEARLY DOUBLED HERSELF SO HEARTILY DID SHE ENJOY THE JOKE THE SMILE SOON FADED FROM AUNT JULIA'S FACE AND HER MIRTHLESS EYES WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS HER NEPHEW'S FACE
MARY JANE WHO WAS THEN A LITTLE GIRL IN SHORT CLOTHES WAS NOW THE MAIN PROP OF THE HOUSEHOLD FOR SHE HAD THE ORGAN IN HADDINGTON ROAD SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH THE ACADEMY AND GAVE A PUPILS CONCERT EVERY YEAR IN THE UPPER ROOM OF THE ANTIENT CONCERT ROOMS
HE WAS UNDECIDED ABOUT THE LINES FROM ROBERT BROWNING FOR HE FEARED THEY WOULD BE ABOVE THE HEADS OF HIS HEARERS SOME QUOTATION THAT THEY WOULD RECOGNISE FROM SHAKESPEARE OR FROM THE MELODIES WOULD BE BETTER THE INDELICATE CLACKING OF THE MEN'S HEELS
NOW MARY GRIMES IF I DON'T TAKE IT MAKE ME TAKE IT FOR I FEEL I WANT IT HIS HOT FACE HAD LEANED FORWARD A LITTLE TOO CONFIDENTIALLY AND HE HAD ASSUMED A VERY LOW DUBLIN ACCENT SO THAT THE YOUNG LADIES WITH ONE INSTINCT RECEIVED HIS SPEECH IN SILENCE MISS FURLONG
THE HIGH COLOUR OF HIS CHEEKS PUSHED UPWARDS EVEN TO HIS FOREHEAD WHERE IT SCATTERED ITSELF IN A FEW FORMLESS PATCHES OF PALE RED AND ON HIS HAIRLESS FACE THERE SCINTILLATED RESTLESSLY THE POLISHED LENSES AND THE BRIGHT GILT RIMS OF THE GLASSES WHICH SCREENED HIS DELICATE AND RESTLESS EYES
HE DID NOT FINISH HIS SENTENCE BUT SEEING THAT AUNT KATE WAS OUT OF EARSHOT AT ONCE LED THE THREE YOUNG LADIES INTO THE BACK ROOM THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WAS OCCUPIED BY TWO SQUARE TABLES PLACED END TO END AND ON THESE AUNT JULIA AND THE CARETAKER WERE STRAIGHTENING AND SMOOTHING A LARGE CLOTH
MISSUS CONROY LAUGHED DON'T MIND HIM AUNT KATE SHE SAID HE'S REALLY AN AWFUL BOTHER WHAT WITH GREEN SHADES FOR TOM'S EYES AT NIGHT AND MAKING HIM DO THE DUMB BELLS AND FORCING EVA TO EAT THE STIRABOUT THE POOR CHILD AND SHE SIMPLY HATES THE SIGHT OF IT
HIS GLOSSY BLACK HAIR WAS PARTED IN THE MIDDLE AND BRUSHED IN A LONG CURVE BEHIND HIS EARS WHERE IT CURLED SLIGHTLY BENEATH THE GROOVE LEFT BY HIS HAT
O FOR ONE NIGHT SAID MISSUS CONROY BESIDES BESSIE WILL LOOK AFTER THEM
TWO GENTLEMEN AND THREE LADIES MARY JANE O HERE'S MISTER BERGIN AND MISTER KERRIGAN SAID MARY JANE MISTER KERRIGAN WILL YOU TAKE MISS POWER MISS FURLONG MAY I GET YOU A PARTNER MISTER BERGIN O THAT'LL JUST DO NOW THREE LADIES MARY JANE
WHAT A COMFORT IT IS TO HAVE A GIRL LIKE THAT ONE YOU CAN DEPEND ON THERE'S THAT LILY I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS COME OVER HER LATELY SHE'S NOT THE GIRL SHE WAS AT ALL GABRIEL WAS ABOUT TO ASK HIS AUNT SOME QUESTIONS ON THIS POINT BUT SHE BROKE OFF SUDDENLY TO GAZE AFTER HER SISTER WHO HAD WANDERED DOWN THE STAIRS AND
THEY HAD GOOD REASON TO BE FUSSY ON SUCH A NIGHT AND THEN IT WAS LONG AFTER TEN O'CLOCK AND YET THERE WAS NO SIGN OF GABRIEL AND HIS WIFE BESIDES THEY WERE DREADFULLY AFRAID THAT FREDDY MALINS MIGHT TURN UP SCREWED THEY WOULD NOT WISH FOR WORLDS THAT ANY OF MARY JANE'S PUPILS SHOULD SEE HIM UNDER THE INFLUENCE
ON THE SIDEBOARD WERE ARRAYED DISHES AND PLATES AND GLASSES AND BUNDLES OF KNIVES AND FORKS AND SPOONS THE TOP OF THE CLOSED SQUARE PIANO SERVED ALSO AS A SIDEBOARD FOR VIANDS AND SWEETS AT A SMALLER SIDEBOARD IN ONE CORNER
HIS FACE WAS FLESHY AND PALLID TOUCHED WITH COLOUR ONLY AT THE THICK HANGING LOBES OF HIS EARS AND AT THE WIDE WINGS OF HIS NOSE HE HAD COARSE FEATURES A BLUNT NOSE A CONVEX AND RECEDING BROW TUMID AND PROTRUDED LIPS
AND THE SHUFFLING OF THEIR SOLES REMINDED HIM THAT THEIR GRADE OF CULTURE DIFFERED FROM HIS HE WOULD ONLY MAKE HIMSELF RIDICULOUS BY QUOTING POETRY TO THEM WHICH THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEY WOULD THINK THAT HE WAS AIRING HIS SUPERIOR EDUCATION
HE KEPT EMITTING SOUNDS MORE RESEMBLING YELPS AND SNARLS THAN ANYTHING MORE HUMAN LIKE SOME SAVAGE BEAST NURSING ITS PENT UP RAGE WHEN HE HAD MADE AN END OF READING FOR THE SEASON HE LET HIS PASSION HAVE FULL VENT
FOR MARJORIE LINDON FOR HIS DEAR LOVE IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT SHE SHALL WISH THAT SHE WAS NEVER BORN NOR HE AND THE GODS OF THE SHADOWS SHALL SMELL THE SWEET INCENSE OF HER SUFFERING
PRESENTLY I SAW HER GLANCING ACROSS AT THE PERSON WHO WAS IN THE OPPOSITE BOX ON LOOKING I SAW A WOMAN WITH WHOM I WAS QUITE FAMILIAR SHE HAD ONCE BEEN A KEPT WOMAN AND HAD TRIED TO GO ON THE STAGE HAD FAILED
WHO THINKS HE IS MAKING SOME HEADWAY BY CALLING ON HER AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING AND BY SENDING HER JEWELS TO ANY EXTENT BUT SHE CAN'T STAND HIM SHE MAKES A MISTAKE HE IS VERY RICH IT IS IN VAIN THAT I SAY TO HER FROM TIME TO TIME
THE GREAT PAUL LESSINGHAM IS AS GREAT A THIEF AS YOU AND GREATER FOR AT LEAST THAN YOU HE HAS MORE COURAGE FOR SOME MOMENTS HE WAS STILL THEN EXCLAIMED WITH SUDDEN FIERCENESS
ON EACH SHEET A CREST AND AN ADDRESS WERE STAMPED IN GOLD AND ALL THE SHEETS WERE OF THE SAME SHAPE AND SIZE I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME I SAW WRITING PAPER LIKE THAT AGAIN
AS IF TO GIVE ME TIME TO DIGEST HIS GIBE YOU SAW PAUL LESSINGHAM WELL THE GREAT PAUL LESSINGHAM WAS HE THEN SO GREAT
I KNOW NOT HOW LONG HE CONTINUED SPEECHLESS WHEN HIS BREATH RETURNED IT WAS WITH CHOKINGS AND GASPINGS IN THE MIDST OF WHICH HE HISSED OUT HIS WORDS AS IF THEIR MERE PASSAGE THROUGH HIS THROAT BROUGHT HIM NEAR TO STRANGULATION
AND WAS GIVING HER A BAG OF SWEETS INTO WHICH SHE DIPPED AT ONCE SMILING THEN SHE HELD IT OUT TOWARD PRUDENCE WITH A GESTURE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY WILL YOU HAVE SOME NO SIGNALLED PRUDENCE
THAT THEN I CONTINUED IS WHY SHE IS ALONE HERE PRECISELY BUT WHO WILL SEE HER HOME HE WILL
HE CONDESCENDED TO NOTICE WHAT I WAS HOLDING OUT TO HIM SO THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE STOLEN THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TAKEN FROM THE DRAWER IN THE BUREAU THE DRAWER WHICH WAS LOCKED
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED YOU KNOW ONE
I WOULD RATHER FOR YOU TO INTRODUCE ME TO HER AT HER OWN HOUSE YES THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT WHY BECAUSE SHE IS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A JEALOUS OLD DUKE PROTECTION IS CHARMING
THE PACKET WAS BOUND ABOUT BY A STRING OF PINK RIBBON A FACT ON WHICH HE PRESENTLY BEGAN TO COMMENT WITH WHAT A PRETTY STRING YOU HAVE ENCIRCLED IT AND HOW NEATLY IT IS TIED SURELY ONLY A WOMAN'S HAND COULD TIE A KNOT LIKE THAT
I SOON TURNED THE CONVERSATION IN HER DIRECTION THE OLD DUKE IS AT YOUR NEIGHBOURS I SAID TO PRUDENCE OH NO SHE IS PROBABLY ALONE BUT SHE MUST BE DREADFULLY BORED SAID GASTON
I SHOULD NOT FAIL TO KNOW IT THE CALIGRAPHY WAS LIKE THE PAPER UNUSUAL BOLD DECIDED AND I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED PRODUCED BY A J PEN ALL THE TIME THAT HE WAS READING
FOR WHEN SHE PUT DOWN HER GLASSES A SMILE THAT CHARMING FEMININE SALUTATION FLITTED ACROSS HER LIPS AS IF TO ANSWER THE BOW WHICH SHE SEEMED TO EXPECT BUT I DID NOT RESPOND
CHAPTER NINE THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKET I PULLED UP SHARPLY AS IF A BRAKE HAD BEEN SUDDENLY AND EVEN MERCILESSLY APPLIED TO BRING ME TO A STANDSTILL
WHO HAD REMEMBERED MY FACE FOR A MOMENT DID NOT REMEMBER MY NAME I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED TO MY DISADVANTAGE THAN THUS FORGOTTEN I KNEW SAID GASTON THAT SHE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE US
HE CALLS HER HIS DAUGHTER LOOKS AFTER HER LIKE A CHILD AND IS ALWAYS IN THE WAY I AM SURE AT THIS VERY MOMENT ONE OF HIS SERVANTS IS PROWLING ABOUT IN THE STREET TO SEE WHO COMES OUT AND ESPECIALLY WHO GOES IN AH
BY WHAT ROBBER'S ARTIFICE HAVE YOU SAVED YOURSELF FROM G A O L HIS MANNER CHANGED SO THAT ALL AT ONCE HE SEEMED TO SNARL AT ME
TO HAVE BECOME A TRIFLE SMUDGED AS USUAL THE MAN IN THE BED SEEMED TO EXPERIENCE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY IN DECIPHERING WHAT WAS PASSING THROUGH MY MIND THAT IS SO YOU AND HE YOU ARE A PAIR
THE LETTERS OF HIS DEAR LOVE OF HIS DEAR LOVE HIS PAUL LESSINGHAM'S SO IT IS AS I GUESSED AS I KNEW AS I SAW MARJORIE LINDON
SO AS TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER HER AS IF I HAD FORGOTTEN WHILE SHE REMEMBERED SUPPOSING HERSELF MISTAKEN SHE LOOKED AWAY THE CURTAIN WENT UP I HAVE OFTEN SEEN MARGUERITE AT THE THEATRE
IS IT NOT SWEET TO STAND CLOSE AT MY SIDE YOU WITH YOUR WHITE SKIN IF I WERE A WOMAN WOULD YOU NOT TAKE ME FOR A WIFE THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS WAS SAID WHICH WAS SO ESSENTIALLY FEMININE
WE AGAIN HEARD MARGUERITE'S VOICE CALLING TO PRUDENCE WHO RUSHED TO HER DRESSING ROOM WINDOW I FOLLOWED WITH GASTON AS SHE OPENED THE WINDOW WE HID OURSELVES SO AS NOT TO BE SEEN FROM OUTSIDE
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS SMILING ACROSS AT MARGUERITE TO ASK HER WHOM ARE YOU LOOKING AT MARGUERITE GAUTIER YOU KNOW HER YES I AM HER MILLINER AND SHE IS A NEIGHBOUR OF MINE
WAS A WISH TO MAKE HER SEE THAT I WAS STRONGER THAN SHE HOW MANY WAYS DOES THE HEART TAKE HOW MANY REASONS DOES IT INVENT FOR ITSELF IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT WHAT IT WANTS
THESE PEOPLE WILL ALSO BE SURPRISED THEY WILL SAY LORD
I SAW THAT IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WOULD SPEAK YOU HAVE COME SHE PANTED OUT AT LAST TO HEAR MY DECISION IT IS TOO SOON THE STEAMER HAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS YET BEFORE IT CAN MAKE PORT
IF SHE COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT ME I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT HER I'M THE EASIEST GOING PERSON IN THE WORLD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ALLOWING THE GIRL YOU ARE PRACTICALLY ENGAGED TO TO MAKE A FOOL OF HERSELF OVER ANOTHER MAN I WON'T STAND FOR IT
TAKE THE REWARD HE HAS PLANNED FOR YOU TO HAVE FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME FOOD I WAS THIRSTY AND YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK I WAS A STRANGER AND YOU TOOK ME INTO YOUR HOMES
HE MAKE ME OUT A LIAH FO A DOLLAH HE GRINNED ARE YOU SURE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT YOU SAW MISTER WOODS AT HALF PAST EIGHT I QUESTIONED YAS SUH YOU CAIN'T CATCH ME UP NO MO
MY DARLING IS HAPPY WITH MISSUS CAREW TOO HAPPY
AND SHE NEVER HINTED IT TO ME BY WORD OR LOOK OH VALERIE VALERIE WHAT TORTURES WE HAVE BOTH SUFFERED AND NOW YOU ARE HAPPY WHILE I GRIEF SEEMED TO ENGULF HER
YIELDED TO A RECOGNITION OF SOMETHING BESIDES HER OWN TERRIBLE BROODING SHE LET HER ARMS DROP AND THE LIPS WHICH HAD NOT SPOKEN THAT MORNING MOVED SLIGHTLY I WAITED RESPECTFULLY
ARE YOU SURE MISTER WOODS WAS IN HERE WELL NO SIR NOT EXACTLY I REMEMBER MISTER FARNSWORTH AND MISTER BROWN THERE WERE PROBABLY SOME OTHERS THE REASON I THINK MISTER WOODS WAS HERE
IF HE HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE IN JERUSALEM PRETENDING TO BE KING OF THE JEWS THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS WANTED TO KILL JESUS THAT WAS ALL THEY TALKED ABOUT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS TO BE DONE
I MADE HASTE TO SAY LISTEN TO MY LITTLE STORY IT WILL NOT ADD TO YOUR PAIN RATHER ALLEVIATE IT
AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO SWEAR IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER THE CORONER THOUGHT A MOMENT THEN TURNED TO ME WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY NOTHING THAT SEEMED TO REFER TO THE ACCIDENT ALL THE REST WAS APPARENTLY DELIRIUM
I DO NOT KNOW WHY I HAVE SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOU IN ANOTHER FIFTEEN MINUTES SHE CAME TO LEAD ME TO MISSUS OCUMPAUGH I ENTERED WITHOUT KNOCKING THEY TOLD ME TO SHE WAS SEATED AS THEY SAID IN A LARGE CHAIR
STARING LIKE ONE WHO SEES NOTHING OUT INTO THE NIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW WHICH OVERLOOKS THE RIVER THIS MORNING WE CAN NOT MAKE HER SPEAK HER EYES ARE DRY WITH FEVER ONLY NOW AND THEN SHE UTTERS A LITTLE MOAN
DO WHATEVER YOUR DUTY IS TO CAESAR AND HIS GOVERNMENT YOU WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT FOR YOURSELVES AND ALSO DO YOUR DUTY TO GOD IT WAS SUCH A CLEVER ANSWER THAT NO ONE HAD A WORD TO SAY
IN SPITE OF THE DESPAIR THUS EXPRESSED MY WAY SEEMED TO OPEN A LITTLE I THINK I CAN BREAK MISSUS OCUMPAUGH'S DANGEROUS APATHY IF YOU WILL LET ME SEE HER AGAIN WILL YOU LET ME TRY THE NURSE WE HAVE A NURSE NOW
HELPLESS BEFORE APPROACHING DEATH I COULD IMAGINE HELEN'S AGONY AS SHE SAW THAT DIM BLACK SHAPE
THE DOCTOR SAYS SHE WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE HER HUSBAND UNLESS SOMETHING COMES TO ROUSE HER BUT THE PAPERS GIVE NO NEWS AND ALL THE ATTEMPTS OF THE POLICE END IN NOTHING
ALMOST ANY ONE MIGHT BE ACCUSED SOME ONE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS WORRIED WE ALL KNEW SIR THAT MISTER FELDERSON AND MISTER WOODS WERE NOT VERY FRIENDLY AND MISTER WOODS LAUGHED AND SAID THAT FORTUNATELY HE HAD A PERFECT ALIBI
I HAD NOTHING TO WEAR AND YOU GAVE ME CLOTHES I WAS SICK AND IN PRISON AND YOU CAME TO VISIT ME THEN THESE PEOPLE WILL BE SURPRISED AND SAY LORD WHEN DID WE EVER DO ANYTHING FOR YOU
WHEN THE MEN JUMPED UP FROM THEIR CHAIRS HE DROVE THEM OUT OF THE TEMPLE THEN HE DROVE THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE OUT AFTER THE MEN IT IS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPTURES GOD'S HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER
MOTIONING THE ANGRY JACKSON AWAY HE HE SET DOWN AT DE TABLE BUT HE AIN'T EAT NONE THE BOY STUTTERED WHAT DO YOU MEAN GEORGE
THERE WAS A MAN'S PICTURE STAMPED ON ONE SIDE OF IT JESUS SAID WHOSE PICTURE IS THAT WHY THEY ANSWERED THAT IS A PICTURE OF CAESAR THE EMPEROR OF ROME ALL RIGHT SAID JESUS
I ALSO KNEW THAT THIS PATIENT HAD OVERHEARD WHAT YOU SAID AS WELL AS I FOR IMPERVIOUS AS THE DOOR LOOKED I HAD OFTEN HEARD THE DOCTOR'S MUTTERINGS WHEN HE THOUGHT I WAS SAFE BEYOND EAR SHOT IF NOT ASLEEP
GROGAN DO YOU REMEMBER WHO WAS IN THE BAR BETWEEN SEVEN THIRTY AND EIGHT THIRTY ON THE NIGHT OF THE FELDERSON MURDER ONLY ONE OR TWO OF THE GENTLEMEN SIR THERE WAS MISTER FARNSWORTH AND MISTER BROWN AND I THINK MISTER WOODS
WAS SHE OF COMMON BLOOD COMMON MANNERS IT DOES NOT SEEM POSSIBLE GWENDOLEN IS BY NATURE SO DAINTY IN ALL HER WAYS THE WOMAN WAS A LADY I DID NOT SEE HER FACE IT WAS HEAVILY VEILED
THEY UNTIED IT AND LED IT AWAY SOME OF THEM PUT THEIR CLOTHES ON THE DONKEY'S BACK FOR A KING MUST RIDE IN COMFORT OTHERS SPREAD THEIR CLOTHES OUT ON THE STREET FOR A KING SHOULD RIDE IN STATE
IT CONCERNS GWENDOLEN'S REAL MOTHER YOU SAY YOU DO NOT KNOW HER NO
THE OTHER DISCIPLES WILL ALL BE THERE AND THE SOLDIERS WON'T KNOW WHICH MAN TO TAKE BUT I WILL GO UP TO JESUS AND KISS HIM THE MAN I KISS WILL BE THE ONE YOU WANT
BUT I REFUSE TO ACCOMPANY YOU I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING IS A MOVING WONDER OF SUPREME INTEREST AND TRAGEDY AND BEAUTY WHICH WAS WHAT THE LETTER IN QUESTION AMOUNTED TO
THE DIRECTION OF THE SWIM WAS DETERMINED A LITTLE BY THE GENIUS OF THE PLACE FOR PLACES HAVE A GENIUS THOUGH THE LESS WE TALK ABOUT IT THE BETTER AND A GOOD DEAL BY THE TUTORS AND RESIDENT FELLOWS
POOH VOLCANIC SAYS THE LEADING TOURIST
OUR LUGGAGE EXPLAINED RICKIE COMES IN THE HOTEL OMNIBUS IF YOU WOULD KINDLY PAY A SHILLING FOR MINE ANSELL TURNED ASIDE TO SOME LARGE LIGHTED WINDOWS THE ABODE OF A HOSPITABLE DON AND FROM OTHER WINDOWS THERE FLOATED FAMILIAR VOICES
FOR WHOSE ADVANTAGE THE SCHOOL HAD BEEN FOUNDED SHE AND MISSUS JACKSON DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT AT THEIR TEA PARTIES AND THE LATTER LADY WAS SURE THAT NO GOOD NO GOOD OF ANY KIND WOULD COME TO DUNWOOD HOUSE FROM SUCH ILL GOTTEN PLUNDER
THEN THE TRAM ARRIVED THE SLOW STUFFY TRAM THAT PLIES EVERY TWENTY MINUTES BETWEEN THE UNKNOWN AND THE MARKETPLACE AND TOOK THEM PAST THE DESECRATED GROUNDS OF DOWNING PAST ADDENBROOKES HOSPITAL GIRT LIKE A VENETIAN PALACE WITH A MANTLING CANAL
TO WORK WITHOUT CRITICIZING TO THROW HIMSELF VIGOROUSLY INTO THE MACHINE NOT TO MIND IF HE WAS PINCHED NOW AND THEN BY THE ELABORATE WHEELS MISTER ANSELL CRIED HIS WIFE LAUGHING SOMEWHAT SHRILLY AHA NOW I UNDERSTAND
I KNOW SHE'D DISLIKE IT BUT SHE OUGHTN'T TO DISLIKE AFTER ALL BEDDERS ARE TO BLAME FOR THE PRESENT LAMENTABLE STATE OF THINGS JUST AS MUCH AS GENTLEFOLK SHE OUGHT TO WANT ME TO COME SHE OUGHT TO INTRODUCE ME TO HER HUSBAND
HE FELT ALMOST AS SAFE AS HE FELT ONCE WHEN HIS MOTHER KILLED A GHOST IN THE PASSAGE BY CARRYING HIM THROUGH IT IN HER ARMS THERE WAS NO GHOST NOW HE WAS FRIGHTENED AT REALITY HE WAS FRIGHTENED AT THE SPLENDOURS AND HORRORS OF THE WORLD
EACH BOY WHO PASSES PULLS HIS EARS VERY FUNNY NO DOUBT BUT EVERY DAY THEY STICK OUT MORE AND GET REDDER AND THIS AFTERNOON WHEN HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS BEING WATCHED HE WAS HOLDING HIS HEAD AND MOANING I HATE THE LOOK ABOUT HIS EYES I HATE THE WHOLE BOY
A RIFLE CORPS WAS TO BE FORMED SHE HOPED THAT THE BOYS WOULD HAVE PROPER UNIFORMS INSTEAD OF SHOOTING IN THEIR OLD CLOTHES AS MISTER JACKSON HAD SUGGESTED THERE WAS TEWSON COULD NOTHING BE DONE ABOUT HIM HE WOULD SLINK AWAY FROM THE OTHER PREFECTS AND GO WITH BOYS OF HIS OWN AGE
WE ARE NOT LEAVING SAWSTON SHE WROTE I SAW HOW SELFISH IT WAS OF ME TO RISK SPOILING HERBERT'S CAREER I SHALL GET USED TO ANY PLACE NOW THAT HE IS GONE NOTHING OF THAT SORT CAN MATTER
SINCE THAT MEETING IN THE SOHO RESTAURANT THERE HAD BEEN SO MUCH TO DO CLOTHES TO BUY PRESENTS TO THANK FOR A BRIEF VISIT TO A TRAINING COLLEGE A HONEYMOON AS BRIEF IN SUCH A BUSTLE WHAT SPIRITUAL UNION COULD TAKE PLACE
THE WOMAN HAD A QUICK EAR AND CAUGHT UP PHRASES WHENEVER SHE HEARD ENGLISH SPOKEN AS WE ROSE TO GO SHE OPENED HER WOODEN CHEST AND BROUGHT OUT A BAG MADE OF BED TICKING ABOUT AS LONG AS A FLOUR SACK AND HALF AS WIDE STUFFED FULL OF SOMETHING
HIS LOVE DESIRED NOT OWNERSHIP BUT CONFIDENCE AND TO A LOVE SO PURE IT DOES NOT SEEM TERRIBLE TO COME SECOND HE VALUED EMOTION NOT FOR ITSELF BUT BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY FINAL PATH TO INTIMACY
BUT IN THEM WAS ONE CHINK REVEALING ONE STAR AND THROUGH THIS THE SMOKE ESCAPED INTO THE LIGHT OF STARS INNUMERABLE THEN BUT THEN THE VISION FAILED AND THE VOICE OF SCIENCE WHISPERED THAT ALL SMOKE REMAINS ON EARTH IN THE FORM OF SMUTS
WE OWE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT TO THEM THEIR WAGES ARE ABSURD AND WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM OFF THEY GO TO BARNWELL AND THEN THEIR LIVES ARE HIDDEN I JUST KNOW THAT MISSUS ABERDEEN HAS A HUSBAND BUT THAT'S ALL SHE NEVER WILL TALK ABOUT HIM
IT IS THE FIRST BIG BUILDING THAT THE INCOMING VISITOR SEES OH HERE COME THE COLLEGES CRIES THE PROTESTANT PARENT AND THEN LEARNS THAT IT WAS BUILT BY A PAPIST WHO MADE A FORTUNE OUT OF MOVABLE EYES FOR DOLLS BUILT OUT OF DOLL'S EYES TO CONTAIN IDOLS
I'M GETTING SOMEWHAT INVOLVED BUT HEAR ME O AGNES FOR I AM PRACTICAL
MAREK WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO BE AGREEABLE POOR FELLOW AS IF HE HAD IT ON HIS MIND THAT HE MUST MAKE UP FOR HIS DEFICIENCIES MISSUS SHIMERDA GREW MORE CALM AND REASONABLE BEFORE OUR VISIT WAS OVER AND WHILE ANTONIA TRANSLATED PUT IN A WORD NOW AND THEN ON HER OWN ACCOUNT
ON EVOLUTION ON CATULLUS THEY DEALT WITH SO MUCH AND THEY HAD EXPERIENCED SO LITTLE WAS IT POSSIBLE HE WOULD EVER COME TO THINK CAMBRIDGE NARROW IN HIS SHORT LIFE RICKIE HAD KNOWN TWO SUDDEN DEATHS AND THAT IS ENOUGH TO DISARRANGE ANY PLACID OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD
HORNBLOWER ALSO SWEPT PAST YELLING DERISIVELY WITH HIS LUGGAGE NEATLY PILED ABOVE HIS HEAD LET'S GET OUT AND WALK MUTTERED ANSELL BUT RICKIE WAS SUCCOURING A DISTRESSED FEMALE MISSUS ABERDEEN
AND THE FAMILIAR MISTAKES IN A BEETHOVEN SONATA THE COLLEGE THOUGH SMALL WAS CIVILIZED AND PROUD OF ITS CIVILIZATION IT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT GLORY TO BE A BLUE THERE NOR AN ADDITIONAL GLORY TO GET DRUNK
WE SAY LET THEM TALK PERSISTED RICKIE BUT I NEVER DID LIKE LETTING PEOPLE TALK WE ARE RIGHT AND THEY ARE WRONG BUT I WISH THE THING COULD HAVE BEEN DONE MORE QUIETLY THE HEADMASTER DOES GET SO EXCITED HE HAS GIVEN A GANG OF FOOLISH PEOPLE THEIR OPPORTUNITY
LONG MAY THEY FLOURISH BUT I DO NOT APPROVE OF THE BOARDING HOUSE SYSTEM IT ISN'T AN INEVITABLE ADJUNCT
THE ISLAND BEGINS TO ROCK AND SO DO THE MINDS OF ITS VISITORS THEY START AND QUARREL AND JABBER FINGERS BURST UP THROUGH THE SAND BLACK FINGERS OF SEA DEVILS THE ISLAND TILTS THE TOURISTS GO MAD BUT JUST BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE ONE MAN
HOW DID YOUR POTATOES GET FROZEN WE GET FROM MISTER BUSHY AT THE POST OFFICE WHAT HE THROW OUT WE GOT NO POTATOES MISSUS BURDEN TONY ADMITTED MOURNFULLY WHEN JAKE WENT OUT MAREK CRAWLED ALONG THE FLOOR AND STUFFED UP THE DOOR CRACK AGAIN
WITH A SIGH OF JOY HE ENTERED THE PERISHABLE HOME THAT WAS HIS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL FIRE AND THE KETTLE BOILED AT ONCE HE MADE TEA ON THE HEARTH RUG AND ATE THE BISCUITS WHICH MISSUS ABERDEEN HAD BROUGHT FOR HIM UP FROM ANDERSON'S
DESTINY DROVE HIM TO HIS FATHER'S TOMB SO HE ENTERED THE CEMETERY AND THREADING HIS WAY THROUGH THE GRAVES
HE CALLED TO MIND HIS BROTHER AND HIS HOME AND HIS NATIVE LAND AND WEPT OVER HIS SEPARATION FROM THOSE HE HAD FIRST LOVED THEN
LEAVING HIM AGAINST HIS WILL NOW TAKE THEE A SHEET OF PAPER AND WRITE UPON IT WHATSO I SAY TO THEE BADR AL DIN TOOK A FAIR LEAF AND SET ABOUT DOING HIS FATHER'S BIDDING AND HE WROTE THEREON
WHEN THE WAZIR HEARD THIS HE SAID TO HIM O MY SON HEARKEN NOT TO THE VOICE OF PASSION LEST IT CAST THEE INTO THE PIT FOR
NOW THE CAUSE OF HIS DEPARTURE WAS THAT ONE NIGHT AS WE WERE SITTING TOGETHER AND TALKING OF WIVES AND CHILDREN TO COME WE HAD WORDS ON THE MATTER
AND RELATED WHAT HAD PASSED TO HIS FATHER IN LAW WHO REJOICED AND THENCEFORWARD NUR AL DIN CEASED NOT SO TO ADMINISTER THE WAZIRATE THAT THE SULTAN WOULD NOT BE PARTED FROM HIM NIGHT OR DAY AND
AS IS THE WONT OF MINISTERS WHILE THE SULTAN WATCHED HIM AND WONDERED AT HIS WIT AND GOOD SENSE JUDGEMENT AND INSIGHT WHEREFOR HE LOVED HIM AND TOOK HIM INTO INTIMACY WHEN THE DIVAN WAS DISMISSED
AND THY LUCK PREVAIL O'ER THE ENVIER'S SPITE AND
O MY LORD UP AT ONCE AND SAVE THYSELF AND LEAVE THIS HOUSE WHILE IT IS YET TIME AND HE QUOTED THESE LINES ESCAPE WITH THY LIFE IF OPPRESSION BETIDE THEE AND LET THE HOUSE OF ITS BUILDER'S FATE
SO HE SAT DOWN AND APPLIED HIMSELF TO THE BUSINESS OF HIS OFFICE
INCREASED HIS STIPEND AND SUPPLIES UNTIL HIS MEANS WERE AMPLE AND HE BECAME THE OWNER OF SHIPS
OF HIS GOING IN TO THE MINISTER'S DAUGHTER AND OF THE BIRTH OF HIS SON BRIEF HIS LIFE OF FORTY YEARS FROM THE DATE OF HIS DISPUTE WITH HIS BROTHER ADDING THE WORDS AND THIS IS WRITTEN AT MY DICTATION
THE IFRIT LOOKED UPON HIM AND EXCLAIMED PRAISE BE TO HIM THAT HATH NO EQUAL BUT O MY SISTER SHALL I TELL THEE WHAT I HAVE SEEN THIS DAY ASKED SHE WHAT IS THAT
THOSE JETTY LOCKS CANOPUS O'ER HIM THREW
NO TYRANT BUT SHALL RUE WORSE TYRANT'S IRE THE THIRD BEHEST IS LEARN TO BE SILENT IN SOCIETY AND LET THINE OWN FAULTS DISTRACT THINE ATTENTION FROM THE FAULTS OF OTHER MEN FOR
HE SAW THE PORTER WALKING THE MULE UP AND DOWN HE WAS STRUCK BY HER TRAPPINGS OF PRICE AND
IS FRIEND AND EVEN LUNA'S SELF DISPLAYETH LUNACY YOU LEFT AND BY YOUR GOING LEFT THE WORLD A WASTE A WOLF AND LIES A GLOOMY MURK UPON THE FACE OF HILL AND LEA
AND IF ANYTHING CONTRARY BEFAL THEE SET OUT FOR CAIRO AND ASK FOR THINE UNCLE AND SHOW HIM THIS PAPER AND SAY TO HIM THAT I DIED A STRANGER FAR FROM MINE OWN PEOPLE AND
A FULL ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIS SIRE FIRST AND LAST THE DATES OF HIS ARRIVAL AT BASSORAH AND OF HIS FOREGATHERING WITH THE WAZIR
DEIGN ACCEPT MY EXCUSES AND TAKE COMPASSION ON MY SORROWS FOR THOU KNOWEST THAT MY BROTHER WHO WAS PARTNER WITH ME IN THE WAZIRATE DISAPPEARED FROM AMONGST US MANY YEARS AGO
IT WAS DARK NIGHT WHEN HE ALIGHTED AT THE KHAN SO HE SPREAD OUT HIS PRAYER CARPET AND TOOK DOWN THE SADDLE BAGS FROM THE BACK OF HIS MULE AND GAVE HER WITH HER FURNITURE IN CHARGE OF THE DOOR KEEPER THAT HE MIGHT WALK HER ABOUT
WHERE I LEFT THE HUNCHBACK AT THE DOOR OF THE HAMMAM BATH AMIDST THE SULTAN'S WHITE SLAVES
HE SAID TO HIM O MY SON HERE AM I LEFT A MAN IN YEARS AND HAVE NO MALE CHILDREN BUT ALLAH HATH BLESSED ME WITH A DAUGHTER
MARS DYED HIS RUDDY CHEEK AND FROM HIS EYES THE ARCHER STAR HIS GLITTERING ARROW FLIES HIS WIT FROM HERMES CAME AND SOHA'S CARE
AND TAKE HIM BEFORE THE PRESENCE THAT HE MAY PUT HIM TO DEATH AND ALL CRIED ALAS FOR HIS BEAUTY AND HIS LOVELINESS WHEN HE HEARD THIS HE FLED FORTH AT HAZARD KNOWING NOT WHITHER HE WAS GOING AND GAVE NOT OVER HURRYING ONWARDS TILL
FOR HE IS MY BROTHER'S SON AND MY DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND AND HE IS FIT FOR THE WAZIRATE BEING A MAN OF GOOD COUNSEL AND READY CONTRIVANCE THE SULTAN LOOKED AT NUR AL DIN AND LIKED HIM SO
THAT OF THE FUTURE IS A HOUSE OF ETERNITY I WISH BEFORE I DIE TO BEQUEATH THEE CERTAIN CHARGES AND DO THOU TAKE HEED OF WHAT I SAY AND INCLINE THY HEART TO MY WORDS
AND SYMMETRY AND PERFECT GRACE EVEN AS THE POET SAID IN THESE VERSES
THEN HE TOOK NUR AL DIN AND WENT UP WITH HIM TO THE SULTAN AND HIS SON IN LAW WHEN HE CAME BEFORE THE PRESENCE OF THE KING KISSED THE GROUND BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND REPEATED THESE VERSES FOR HE WAS READY OF SPEECH
BUT FRIENDS TO LACK OF WEALTH NO FRIENDSHIP RENDER ON THIS WISE NUR AL DIN CEASED NOT TO COUNSEL HIS SON BADR AL DIN HASAN TILL HIS HOUR CAME AND SIGHING ONE SOBBING SIGH HIS LIFE WENT FORTH
ABOUT HIM AS FOR THE MINISTER'S DAUGHTER SHE SITTETH AMONG HER NURSES AND TIREWOMEN
AND HE MADE FOR HIS FATHER IN LAW A SUMPTUOUS FUNERAL CEREMONY ERE HE WAS LAID IN THE DUST THEN HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH THE EDUCATION OF THIS SON AND
QUOTH THE MINISTER O OUR LORD THE SULTAN I HAD A BROTHER
O MAY THE RAVEN BIRD WHOSE CRY OUR HAPLESS PARTING CROAKED FIND NE'ER A NESTY HOME AND EKE SHED ALL HIS PLUMERY AT LENGTH MY PATIENCE FAILS ME AND THIS ABSENCE WASTES MY FLESH
BUT HE HATH BEEN REMOVED TO THE GRACE OF ALLAH AND HE INFORMED HIM OF ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END ADDING I AM RESOLVED NEVER TO RETURN HOME BEFORE I HAVE SEEN ALL THE CITIES AND COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD

TOMORROW PARIS MAY FOURTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO HIS FATHER THE PUPIL WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE DUKE DE GUINES AN EXCELLENT FLAUTIST
THE LITTLE BOOK OF CRITICISM NEVER APPEARED EIGHTY THE ORCHESTRA IN BERLIN CONTAINS THE GREATEST AGGREGATION OF VIRTUOSI IN THE WORLD
SHE PLAYS THE HARP MAGNIFICENTLY WRITES MOZART IN THE SAME LETTER HAS A GREAT DEAL OF TALENT AND GENIUS AND AN INCOMPARABLE MEMORY SHE KNOWS TWO HUNDRED PIECES AND PLAYS THEM ALL BY HEART
IT IS INDEED DESPICABLE AND CONTRARY TO ALL NATURALNESS IN SONG TRUE THE HUMAN VOICE TREMBLES OF ITSELF BUT ONLY IN A DEGREE THAT REMAINS BEAUTIFUL IT IS IN THE NATURE OF THE VOICE
WAS ANYTHING BUT A NOBLEMAN FIFTY TWO THE ANDANTE IS GOING TO GIVE US THE MOST TROUBLE FOR IT IS FULL OF EXPRESSION AND MUST BE PLAYED WITH TASTE
TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS ACTIVE AS COURT CHAPELMASTER IN SALZBURG AND WHO HAD BEEN ASKED BY HIS SON IN THE SAME LETTER WHEN IT GREW A LITTLE WARMER TO LOOK IN THE ATTIC AND SEND SOME OF YOUR HIS CHURCH MUSIC
WHEN THEY PLAY THE LEFT HAND ALWAYS FOLLOWS AUGSBURG
I NEVER HEARD SUCH QUARTET PLAYING AS HERE BUT WHEN ALL THE GENTLEMEN ARE TOGETHER THEY MIGHT DO BETTER

SEVENTY SIX OTHERS KNOW AS WELL AS YOU AND I THAT TASTES ARE CONTINUALLY CHANGING AND THAT THE CHANGES EXTEND EVEN INTO CHURCH MUSIC
HE WENT INTO THE WINE BUSINESS WHICH FACT LED SHERIDAN TO MAKE THE WITTY SUGGESTION THAT HE INSCRIBE OVER HIS SHOP MICHAEL KELLY COMPOSER OF WINES AND IMPORTER OF MUSIC HE WAS BORN IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY FOUR AND DIED
THAT IS AS IF THE DEVIL HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE IN IT IN A LETTER WRITTEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE TO A NOBLEMAN WHO WAS A COMPOSER AND HAD SUBMITTED A SYMPHONY TO MOZART FOR CRITICISM
IT WOULD BE AN UNWISE MEASURE TO ENTER INTO A DRY STUDY YOU MAY TAKE MY WORD FOR IT NATURE HAS MADE YOU A MELODIST AND YOU WOULD ONLY DISTURB AND PERPLEX YOURSELF REFLECT A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING
AND PLAYS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FEELING MANNHEIM NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER THE PUPIL WAS ROSE CANNABICH TO WHOM THE SONATA REFERRED TO IS DEDICATED
MOZART HIMSELF WAS PLAINLY OF ANOTHER OPINION H E K SEVENTY BEECKE TOLD ME AND IT IS TRUE
REPORTED BY ROCHLITZ MOZART WAS REHEARSING THE ALLEGRO OF ONE OF HIS SYMPHONIES IN LEIPSIC HE WORKED UP SUCH A FIT OF ANGER THAT HE STAMPED HIS FOOT AND BROKE ONE OF HIS SHOE LACES
YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IT WAS ALL THE MORE UNENDURABLE BECAUSE I DID NOT DARE TO SAY TO HIM MUCH TOO QUICK MOREOVER IT IS MUCH EASIER TO PLAY RAPIDLY THAN SLOWLY YOU CAN DROP A FEW NOTES IN PASSAGES WITHOUT ANY ONE NOTICING IT
SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER
IN A LETTER WRITTEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE TO A NOBLE FRIEND CRITICIZING A SYMPHONY FIFTY SIX DO NOT WONDER AT ME IT WAS NOT A CAPRICE
THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF YES SUCH A SHALLOW PATE AS YOU FEELS A PAIN AS SOON AS HE HEARS SOMETHING WHICH HE CAN NOT UNDERSTAND MANNHEIM NOVEMBER THIRTEENTH
BUT THE BEST OF ALL IS THAT WHEN THERE COMES A PASSAGE WHICH OUGHT TO FLOW LIKE OIL IN WHICH THERE NECESSARILY OCCURS A CHANGE OF FINGERS THERE IS NO NEED OF TAKING CARE WHEN THE TIME COMES YOU STOP
I NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE MUSICIANS WERE OLD MEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO END OF DRAGGING IF I HAD NOT FIRST DRIVEN THEM INTO THE FIRE AND MADE THEM ANGRY OUT OF PURE RAGE THEY DID THEIR BEST
NO EXPRESSION NEITHER PIANO NOR FORTE BUT GOES ON ALWAYS THE SAME BUT ALL THAT SIGNIFIES NOTHING TO ME THE ORGAN IS NEVERTHELESS THE KING OF INSTRUMENTS AUGSBURG OCTOBER SEVENTEENTH
SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO HIS FATHER BEECKE WAS A CONCEITED PIANIST SEVENTY ONE NOTHING GIVES ME SO MUCH PLEASURE IN THE ANTICIPATION
A VERY SIMPLE MINUET AND TO SEE IF SHE COULD WRITE A VARIATION ON IT IN VAIN WELL THOUGHT I IT IS BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO BEGIN I THEN BEGAN A VARIATION OF THE FIRST MEASURE AND TOLD HER TO CONTINUE IT
BEFORE WE GO DO YOU MIND IF I LOOK IN YOUR POCKET BUT OF COURSE MONCHARMIN YOU MUST WELL HE ASKED AS MONCHARMIN WAS FEELING AT THE POCKET WELL I CAN FEEL THE PIN
CALLING AOUDA AND SENDING FOR A PALANQUIN IT WAS THEN EIGHT O'CLOCK AT HALF PAST NINE IT BEING THEN HIGH TIDE THE CARNATIC WOULD LEAVE THE HARBOUR MISTER FOGG AND AOUDA GOT INTO THE PALANQUIN
THAT WOULD TASTE FAR DIFFERENT TO SAY NOTHING OF THE SAUSAGES LISTEN HANS SAID THE BUTCHER FOR YOUR SAKE I WILL EXCHANGE AND LET YOU HAVE MY PIG FOR YOUR COW
YOU MUST BECOME A GRINDER LIKE ME ALL YOU WANT IS A GRINDSTONE THE REST COMES OF ITSELF I HAVE ONE WHICH IS A LITTLE DAMAGED INDEED BUT FOR WHICH I WOULD ASK NOTHING MORE THAN YOUR GOOSE WOULD THAT SUIT YOU
AND I MUST GET TO YOKOHAMA BY THE FOURTEENTH AT THE LATEST TO TAKE THE BOAT FOR SAN FRANCISCO I AM SORRY SAID THE SAILOR BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE I OFFER YOU A HUNDRED POUNDS PER DAY
WERE YOU NOT LIKE ME SIR A PASSENGER BY THE RANGOON WHICH ARRIVED YESTERDAY I WAS SIR REPLIED MISTER FOGG COLDLY BUT I HAVE NOT THE HONOUR PARDON ME I THOUGHT I SHOULD FIND YOUR SERVANT HERE
WITH THE OBJECT OF HELPING HIM TO DISCOVER THE MISCREANT WHO WAS VICTIMIZING THEM
BUT THE MANAGERS THEMSELVES THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THEIR TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS ON REACHING THE HALF DARK PASSAGE RICHARD SAID TO MONCHARMIN IN A LOW VOICE I AM SURE THAT NOBODY HAS TOUCHED ME
HOW CAN YOU ASK ME ANSWERED HANS I SHALL BE THE LUCKIEST FELLOW ON EARTH IF I HAVE MONEY AS OFTEN AS I FEEL IN MY POCKET WHAT ELSE SHALL I HAVE TO CARE ABOUT AND HE HANDED OVER THE GOOSE AND TOOK THE GRINDSTONE IN RECEIPT
THUS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO COMMUNICATE WITH HER GHOST
THAT HE WAS KNOCKED OVER AND QUITE DAZED AND FOR A LONG TIME DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS LUCKILY A BUTCHER CAME BY JUST THEN WHEELING A YOUNG PIG IN A BARROW WHAT KIND OF JOKE IS THIS CRIED HE HELPING OUR FRIEND HANS TO RISE
BELOW DECK WAS A SQUARE CABIN OF WHICH THE WALLS BULGED OUT IN THE FORM OF COTS ABOVE A CIRCULAR DIVAN
WITH A SPRIGHTLY EXPRESSION OF THE EYE AND ENERGETIC AND SELF RELIANT COUNTENANCE WOULD HAVE INSPIRED CONFIDENCE IN THE MOST TIMID
WHO WAS CONFUSED BY HIS PATIENCE AND GENEROSITY IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF MY JOURNEY A PART OF MY PROGRAMME THE PURCHASES MADE THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL WHERE THEY DINED AT A SUMPTUOUSLY SERVED TABLE D'HOTE AFTER WHICH AOUDA
AND AN ADDITIONAL REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IF I REACH YOKOHAMA IN TIME ARE YOU IN EARNEST VERY MUCH SO THE PILOT WALKED AWAY A LITTLE DISTANCE AND GAZED OUT TO SEA
WHILE RICHARD SITTING AT HIS WRITING TABLE DID NOT STIR A LITTLE PATIENCE RICHARD SAID MONCHARMIN WE HAVE ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO WAIT THE CLOCK WILL SOON STRIKE TWELVE LAST TIME WE LEFT AT THE LAST STROKE OF TWELVE
THE SAILOR LEANED ON THE RAILING OPENED HIS EYES WIDE AND SAID IS YOUR HONOUR JOKING
KNEELED DOWN AND THANKED GOD WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES THAT HE HAD SHOWN HIM THIS GRACE AND WITHOUT TROUBLING HIM TO THINK WHAT TO DO WITH THEM HAD RELIEVED HIM OF THE HEAVY STONES WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A HINDRANCE TO HIM
AND HIMSELF KEPT AN EYE ON ANY ONE APPROACHING FROM THE FRONT ONCE MORE THIS NOVEL METHOD OF WALKING BEHIND THE SCENES ADOPTED BY THE MANAGERS OF OUR NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MUSIC ATTRACTED ATTENTION
AND FOUND HIMSELF FACED BY AN EXASPERATED RICHARD WHO CROSSING HIS ARMS ON HIS CHEST SAID LOOK HERE
THE YOUTH TOLD HIM HE WAS TAKING THE GOOSE TO A CHRISTENING FEAST JUST HOLD IT HE CONTINUED SEIZING IT BY THE WINGS AND FEEL HOW HEAVY IT IS YET IT WAS ONLY FATTENED FOR EIGHT WEEKS IT WILL BE A RICH MORSEL WHEN ROASTED
MONCHARMIN WHO HAD HIS OWN IDEAS DID NOT WANT RICHARD TO COME TO HIM PRESENTLY WHEN THE TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS WERE GONE AND SAY PERHAPS IT WAS THE AMBASSADOR OR THE MANAGER OF THE CREDIT CENTRAL OR REMY
AND RICHARD BEGAN TO THINK THAT MONCHARMIN WAS TREATING HIM IN A VERY INSUPPORTABLE FASHION MONCHARMIN I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS RICHARD I'VE HAD TOO MUCH OF IT DO YOU DARE TO SUSPECT ME
A PROPER SCISSORS GRINDER IS THE SORT OF MAN WHO WHENEVER HE PUTS HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET FINDS MONEY THERE BUT WHERE HAVE YOU BOUGHT THAT FINE GOOSE I DID NOT BUY IT BUT EXCHANGED IT FOR MY PIG AND THE PIG
I AM SURE OF MY SERVANTS AND IF ONE OF THEM HAD DONE IT HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED SINCE MONCHARMIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AS THOUGH TO SAY THAT HE DID NOT WISH TO ENTER INTO DETAILS
I AM SORRY TO HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO OFFER YOU SAID MISTER FOGG TO FIX WHO BOWED WITHOUT RESPONDING THE DETECTIVE HAD A FEELING AKIN TO HUMILIATION IN PROFITING BY THE KINDNESS OF MISTER FOGG IT'S CERTAIN THOUGHT HE
GOT RID OF HER TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN THE MANAGER'S COAT TAIL POCKET AND DISAPPEARED OR RATHER SHE WAS CONJURED AWAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS RECEIVED FROM MONCHARMIN A FEW MINUTES EARLIER
BESIDES HAVING YOUR BUTTER MILK AND CHEESE EVERY MORNING FOR CERTAIN
WAS QUIETLY ESCORTING AOUDA ABOUT THE STREETS OF THE ENGLISH QUARTER MAKING THE NECESSARY PURCHASES FOR THE LONG VOYAGE BEFORE THEM IT WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR AN ENGLISHMAN LIKE MISTER FOGG TO MAKE THE TOUR OF THE WORLD WITH A CARPET BAG
URGED AOUDA WHO WAS MUCH DISTURBED BY THE SERVANT'S DISAPPEARANCE I SHALL DO ALL I CAN TO FIND HIM REPLIED PHILEAS FOGG
HANS RAISED THE STONE AND MARCHED ON WITH A JOYFUL HEART HIS EYES SHINING WITH PLEASURE I MUST HAVE BEEN BORN LUCKY HE CRIED OUT ALL THAT I DESIRE COMES TO ME AS TO A SUNDAY CHILD
THEN YOU SHALL HAVE A SHARE YOU SHALL INDEED UNCLE HALLO UNCLE CALLED OUT LUKASHKA SHARPLY FROM ABOVE ATTRACTING EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION ALL THE COSSACKS LOOKED UP AT HIM JUST GO TO THE UPPER WATER COURSE THERE'S A FINE HERD OF BOARS THERE
CAME RUNNING TO THE CORDON LUKASHKA RECOGNIZED THE DOG AS ONE BELONGING TO HIS NEIGHBOUR UNCLE EROSHKA A HUNTER AND SAW FOLLOWING IT THROUGH THE THICKET THE APPROACHING FIGURE OF THE HUNTER HIMSELF
FROWNING AND THROWING DOWN THE CHECHEN'S COAT IF AT LEAST IT WERE A GOOD COAT
HE ADDED WELL AND ARE YOU GOING TO WATCH INQUIRED THE CORPORAL AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HEARD WHAT THE OTHER SAID I DID MEAN TO WATCH TONIGHT REPLIED UNCLE EROSHKA MAYBE WITH GOD'S HELP I SHALL KILL SOMETHING FOR THE HOLIDAY
WELL I SAT HERE AND SUDDENLY SAW SOMETHING DARK ON THE OTHER SIDE I SPIED HIM WHEN HE WAS STILL OVER THERE IT WAS AS IF A MAN HAD COME THERE AND FALLEN IN STRANGE AND A PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD A GOOD SIZED PIECE COMES FLOATING
LUKASHKA PULLED HIS CLOAK UP HIGHER AND WALKED BACK ALONE THROWING SWIFT GLANCES NOW TO THE LEFT AT THE WALL OF REEDS NOW TO THE TEREK RUSHING BY BELOW THE BANK I DARESAY HE'S WATCHING OR CREEPING ALONG SOMEWHERE THOUGHT HE OF A POSSIBLE CHECHEN HILLSMAN
STARTED OFF FOR THE CORDON NOT ALONG THE RIVERBANK BUT BREAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE BRAMBLES TO REACH A PATH IN THE WOOD NOW MIND LUKASHKA THEY MAY CUT YOU DOWN HERE SO YOU'D BEST KEEP A SHARP LOOK OUT I TELL YOU
I'M NOT INVENTING REALLY THE OTHER DAY ONE OF OUR COSSACKS SHOT ONE THERE I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH ADDED HE READJUSTING THE MUSKET AT HIS BACK AND IN A TONE THAT SHOWED HE WAS NOT JOKING AH LUKASHKA THE SNATCHER IS HERE SAID THE OLD MAN LOOKING UP
THE CLEARNESS OF EVENING WAS NOTICEABLE IN THE AIR A SENSE OF FRESHNESS CAME FROM THE WOODS THOUGH ROUND THE POST IT WAS STILL HOT THE VOICES OF THE TALKING COSSACKS VIBRATED MORE SONOROUSLY THAN BEFORE
HALF AN HOUR LATER THEY WERE BOTH ON THEIR WAY HOMEWARDS TALKING INCESSANTLY AND ALMOST RUNNING THROUGH THE DENSE WOODS WHICH SEPARATED THE TEREK FROM THE VILLAGE MIND DON'T TELL HER I SENT YOU BUT JUST GO AND FIND OUT IF HER HUSBAND IS AT HOME LUKE WAS SAYING IN HIS SHRILL VOICE
IN A COMMANDING VOICE TO THE COSSACKS WHO RELUCTANTLY TOOK HOLD OF THE BODY OBEYING HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE THEIR CHIEF AFTER DRAGGING THE BODY ALONG FOR A FEW STEPS THE COSSACKS LET FALL THE LEGS WHICH DROPPED WITH A LIFELESS JERK
SAID HE SOFTLY AND BEGAN EXAMINING HIS MUSKET THAT WAS A SCOUT SWIMMING ACROSS EITHER THE OTHERS ARE HERE ALREADY OR ARE NOT FAR OFF ON THE OTHER SIDE I TELL YOU FOR SURE LUKASHKA WAS UNFASTENING HIS BELT AND TAKING OFF HIS CIRCASSIAN COAT
CLOSE IN FRONT AT HIS VERY FEET WAS THE BANK AND AT ITS BASE THE RUSHING TORRENT A LITTLE FARTHER ON WAS THE MOVING MASS OF GLASSY BROWN WATER WHICH EDDIED RHYTHMICALLY ALONG THE BANK AND ROUND THE SHALLOWS FARTHER STILL WATER
THE RUSTLING OF THE REEDS THE SNORING OF THE COSSACKS THE HUM OF MOSQUITOES AND THE RUSHING WATER
LEFT THE CORDON AND WENT TOWARDS THE PLACE ON THE TEREK WHERE THEY WERE TO LIE IN AMBUSH NAZARKA DID NOT WANT TO GO AT ALL BUT LUKASHKA SHOUTED AT HIM AND THEY SOON STARTED AFTER THEY HAD GONE A FEW STEPS IN SILENCE THE COSSACKS TURNED ASIDE FROM THE DITCH
WAS LAID ON THE BANK PRESSING DOWN THE GRASS HOW YELLOW HE IS SAID ANOTHER WHERE HAVE OUR FELLOWS GONE TO SEARCH I EXPECT THE REST OF THEM ARE ON THE OTHER BANK IF THIS ONE HAD NOT BEEN A SCOUT HE WOULD NOT HAVE SWUM THAT WAY WHY ELSE SHOULD HE SWIM ALONE SAID A THIRD
IN WHICH THE EXPERIENCED EYES OF THE COSSACK DETECTED TREES CARRIED DOWN BY THE CURRENT ONLY VERY RARELY SHEET LIGHTNING MIRRORED IN THE WATER AS IN A BLACK GLASS DISCLOSED THE SLOPING BANK OPPOSITE THE RHYTHMIC SOUNDS OF NIGHT
AS SOON AS HE LANDED AND LOOKED ROUND YOU WON'T GET AWAY OH THERE WAS SOMETHING CHOKING ME
YOU SEE IT HAS A HOLE IN IT SAID HE BLOWING INTO THE MUZZLE I WANT IT JUST FOR A SOUVENIR LUKASHKA DID NOT ANSWER EVIDENTLY THIS SORT OF BEGGING VEXED HIM BUT HE KNEW IT COULD NOT BE AVOIDED SEE WHAT A DEVIL SAID HE
ONE COSSACK WITH A THIN FACE MUCH BURNT BY THE SUN LAY NEAR THE HUT EVIDENTLY DEAD DRUNK BY A WALL WHICH THOUGH IT HAD BEEN IN SHADOW SOME TWO HOURS PREVIOUSLY WAS NOW EXPOSED TO THE SUN'S FIERCE SLANTING RAYS
RIGHT ENOUGH IT IS AN ABREK HE THOUGHT JOYFULLY AND SUDDENLY RISING TO HIS KNEES HE AGAIN TOOK AIM
TURNING RESOLUTELY AND ALMOST COMMANDINGLY TO THE CORPORAL IT'S TIME TO RELIEVE GUARD AND HOLDING ALOFT HIS GUN HE BEGAN TO DESCEND FROM THE WATCH TOWER WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE ORDER COME DOWN SAID THE CORPORAL AFTER LUKASHKA HAD STARTED AND GLANCED ROUND
HE THRUST HIMSELF OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE AND LOOKED ALONG THE RIVER BUT COULD SEE NOTHING AND AS HE CONTINUED LOOKING OUT AT INTERVALS UPON THE RIVER AND AT THE OPPOSITE BANK NOW DIMLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE WATER IN THE FAINT MOONLIGHT
WIPING THE SWEAT FROM HIS BROAD RED FACE WITH THE SLEEVE OF HIS COAT AH THERE'S A VULTURE LIVING IN THE PLANE TREE HERE UNCLE AS SOON AS NIGHT COMES HE BEGINS HOVERING ROUND SAID NAZARKA WINKING AND JERKING HIS SHOULDER AND LEG COME COME SAID THE OLD MAN INCREDULOUSLY
WHERE HAS HE BEEN SHOOTING HAVEN'T YOU SEEN I SUPPOSE YOU'RE TOO YOUNG SAID LUKASHKA CLOSE BY THE DITCH
SANDALS MADE OF UNDRESSED DEER'S HIDE TIED ON WITH STRINGS WHILE ON HIS HEAD HE HAD A ROUGH LITTLE WHITE CAP HE CARRIED OVER ONE SHOULDER A SCREEN TO HIDE BEHIND WHEN SHOOTING PHEASANTS AND A BAG CONTAINING A HEN FOR LURING HAWKS AND A SMALL FALCON
WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE SKIFF LUKASHKA BEGAN TO UNDRESS
HE DROPPED HIS HEAD UPON THE PALM FIRST OF ONE HAND AND THEN OF THE OTHER AN ELDERLY COSSACK WITH A BROAD GREYISH BLACK BEARD WAS LYING IN HIS SHIRT GIRDLED WITH A BLACK STRAP CLOSE TO THE RIVER
THE ANGEL OF SILENCE HAD TAKEN WING THE COSSACKS BEGAN BUSTLING ABOUT AND TALKING TWO OF THEM WENT TO CUT BRUSHWOOD FOR A SHELTER OTHERS STROLLED TOWARDS THE CORDON LUKE AND NAZARKA RAN TO GET READY TO GO TO THE VILLAGE
LOOK THERE SAID LUKASHKA SEIZING HIM BY THE SHOULDERS AND PULLING HIM WITH SUCH FORCE THAT ERGUSHOV GROANED HE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH LUKASHKA POINTED AND DISCERNING A BODY IMMEDIATELY CHANGED HIS TONE O LORD BUT I SAY MORE WILL COME I TELL YOU THE TRUTH
SUCH AN ATTITUDE TO DAY COULD BELONG ONLY TO MISTER EDWARD ROSIER AND THIS GENTLEMAN PROVED IN FACT TO HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING THE QUESTION OF SPEAKING TO HER WHEN HE HAD ASSURED HIMSELF THAT SHE WAS UNACCOMPANIED HE DREW NEAR
YOU'LL TRY AND MAKE HER AMENDS ALL YOU CAN FOR MY BAD LUCK AND THERE'S THE LITTLE WENCH THE FATHER TURNED HIS EYES ON MAGGIE WITH A STILL MORE EAGER LOOK WHILE SHE WITH A BURSTING HEART
HE'LL SAY NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT WISE SAID ISABEL AS IF GILBERT OSMOND HAD NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE ROSIER GAVE HER A SHARP LOOK DO YOU MEAN THAT WITHOUT MY BIBELOTS I'M NOTHING
AND SHE WENT ON WITHOUT A MURMUR WITHOUT FALTERING OR GLANCING BACK ISABEL HOWEVER ALLOWING HERSELF THIS LAST LIBERTY
BUT IF IT WAS AN AFFECTATION SHE WAS AT A LOSS TO SEE WHAT HER HUSBAND AFFECTED SHE COULD ONLY DIMLY PERCEIVE THAT HE HAD MORE TRADITIONS THAN SHE SUPPOSED IT HAD BECOME HER HABIT TO BE SO CAREFUL AS TO WHAT SHE SAID TO HIM THAT
TO ALLUDE TO HIS DAUGHTER'S SUDDEN DEPARTURE SHE SPOKE OF IT ONLY AFTER THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE BUT SHE HAD FORBIDDEN HERSELF EVER TO ASK OSMOND A QUESTION ALL SHE COULD DO WAS TO MAKE A DECLARATION AND THERE WAS ONE THAT CAME VERY NATURALLY
THAT THE SIGNORA CONTESSA BEGGED THEM NOT TO WAIT SHE WOULD COME HOME IN A CAB ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THIS LADY'S QUICK SYMPATHIES HAD ENLISTED THEMSELVES WITH MISTER ROSIER ISABEL GOING RATHER LATE TO DRESS FOR DINNER FOUND PANSY SITTING IN HER ROOM
REALLY BELIEVING THAT THIS WAS THE MEANING OF TULLIVER'S FLUSHED FACE AND SPARKLING EYES NO I'VE NOT BEEN DRINKING SAID TULLIVER I WANT NO DRINKING TO HELP ME MAKE UP MY MIND AS I'LL SERVE NO LONGER UNDER A SCOUNDREL VERY WELL
WAS THAT OF A MAN NOT SO MUCH OFFERING AN EXPLANATION AS PUTTING A THING INTO WORDS ALMOST INTO PICTURES TO SEE HIMSELF HOW IT WOULD LOOK HE CONSIDERED A WHILE THE PICTURE HE HAD EVOKED AND SEEMED GREATLY PLEASED WITH IT AND THEN HE WENT ON
WHO WAS BENDING OVER HER SEWING WHILE HER MOTHER WAS MAKING THE TEA THEY ALL LOOKED UP WITH SURPRISE WHEN THEY HEARD THE WELL KNOWN FOOT WHY WHAT'S UP NOW TOM SAID HIS FATHER YOU'RE A BIT EARLIER THAN USUAL OH THERE WAS NOTHING MORE FOR ME TO DO SO I CAME AWAY
THE MORNING LIGHT WAS GROWING CLEARER FOR THEM AND THEY COULD SEE THE HEAVINESS GATHERING IN HIS FACE AND THE DULNESS IN HIS EYES BUT AT LAST HE LOOKED TOWARD TOM AND SAID I HAD MY TURN I BEAT HIM THAT WAS NOTHING BUT FAIR
HE HAS MADE ME BELIEVE IN TRUE LOVE I NEVER DID BEFORE OF COURSE YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MIND THAT WITH THOSE CONVICTIONS I'M DREADFUL COMPANY FOR PANSY OSMOND TOOK A SIP OF A GLASS OF WINE HE LOOKED PERFECTLY GOOD HUMOURED
IT'S VERY ABSURD MY DEAR OSMOND SHE SAID TO INVENT SO MANY PRETTY REASONS FOR POOR PANSY'S BANISHMENT WHY DON'T YOU SAY AT ONCE THAT YOU WANT TO GET HER OUT OF MY WAY HAVEN'T YOU DISCOVERED THAT I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ROSIER I DO INDEED
I NEVER WANTED ANYTHING BUT WHAT WAS FAIR BUT FATHER DEAR FATHER SAID MAGGIE AN UNSPEAKABLE ANXIETY PREDOMINATING OVER HER GRIEF YOU FORGIVE HIM YOU FORGIVE EVERY ONE NOW
HE HAD REMOVED HIS HAT AND WAS BOWING AND SMILING HE HAD EVIDENTLY INTRODUCED HIMSELF WHILE THE COUNTESS'S EXPRESSIVE BACK DISPLAYED TO ISABEL'S EYE A GRACIOUS INCLINATION
LET THE ROOMS BE AS BARE AND THE HEARTS AS SAD AS THEY MIGHT INSIDE THERE IS A VERY PLEASANT LIGHT IN TOM'S BLUE GRAY EYES AS HE GLANCES AT THE HOUSE WINDOWS THAT FOLD IN HIS BROW NEVER DISAPPEARS BUT IT IS NOT UNBECOMING
SUDDENLY WAKEM FELT SOMETHING HAD ARRESTED MISTER TULLIVER'S ARM FOR THE FLOGGING CEASED AND THE GRASP ON HIS OWN ARM WAS RELAXED GET AWAY WITH YOU GO SAID TULLIVER ANGRILY BUT IT WAS NOT TO WAKEM THAT HE SPOKE
HE ONLY SAID SUDDENLY BESSY FETCH THE BOY AND GIRL TELL EM TO MAKE HASTE MAGGIE AND TOM THREW ON THEIR CLOTHES HASTILY IN THE CHILL GRAY LIGHT AND REACHED THEIR FATHER'S ROOM ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT
WAKEM HAD HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO LOOSE THE BRIDLE AT ONCE AND AS THE HORSE ONLY STAGGERED A FEW PACES AND THEN STOOD STILL HE MIGHT HAVE RISEN AND REMOUNTED WITHOUT MORE INCONVENIENCE THAN A BRUISE AND A SHAKE BUT BEFORE HE COULD RISE TULLIVER WAS OFF HIS HORSE TOO
I'STEAD O THAT POOR CROOKED CREATUR YOU'LL PROSPER THE WORLD MY LAD YOU'LL MAYBE SEE THE DAY WHEN WAKEM AND HIS SON ULL BE A ROUND OR TWO BELOW YOU YOU'LL LIKE ENOUGH BE TA'EN INTO PARTNERSHIP AS YOUR UNCLE DEANE WAS BEFORE YOU
GO AND SEEK FOR SOMEBODY TO FETCH THE DOCTOR HE LOOKED UP AT HER WITH FULL COMPREHENSION AND SAID DOCTOR NO NO DOCTOR IT'S MY HEAD THAT'S ALL HELP ME TO BED
THE EYES IN THE PARLOR WERE NOT TURNED TOWARD THE BRIDGE JUST THEN AND THE GROUP THERE WAS SITTING IN UNEXPECTANT SILENCE MISTER TULLIVER IN HIS ARM CHAIR TIRED WITH A LONG RIDE AND RUMINATING WITH A WORN LOOK FIXED CHIEFLY ON MAGGIE
WHO WAS IN THE ACT OF TRYING TO RECOVER HIS FEET GRASPED HIM BY THE LEFT ARM SO AS TO PRESS WAKEM'S WHOLE WEIGHT ON THE RIGHT ARM WHICH RESTED ON THE GROUND AND FLOGGED HIM FIERCELY ACROSS THE BACK WITH HIS RIDING WHIP WAKEM SHOUTED FOR HELP BUT NO HELP CAME
PANSY HAD SO LITTLE CHANCE TO RAMBLE THAT HER VIEW OF THE CASE WAS NOT WHOLLY DISINTERESTED IT MAY BE DIVINED THAT SHE HAD A SECRET HOPE THAT
A SPARK OF TIMID PASSION WHICH TOUCHED ISABEL TO THE HEART AT THE SAME TIME A WAVE OF ENVY PASSED OVER HER SOUL AS SHE COMPARED THE TREMULOUS LONGING THE DEFINITE IDEAL
TOM NEVER LIVED TO TASTE ANOTHER MOMENT SO DELICIOUS AS THAT AND MAGGIE COULDN'T HELP FORGETTING HER OWN GRIEVANCES TOM WAS GOOD AND IN THE SWEET HUMILITY THAT SPRINGS IN US ALL IN MOMENTS OF TRUE ADMIRATION AND GRATITUDE
SANK ON HER KNEES TO BE CLOSER TO THE DEAR TIME WORN FACE WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENT WITH HER THROUGH LONG YEARS AS THE SIGN OF HER DEEPEST LOVE AND HARDEST TRIAL YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF HER TOM DON'T YOU FRET MY WENCH
NEVER MIND PANSY ANSWERED IN THE TONE OF EAGER APOLOGY AND THEN THERE WAS A SILENCE THE COUNTESS WAS A LONG TIME COMING DID YOU SHOW YOUR AUNT EVERYTHING AND DID SHE ENJOY IT ISABEL ASKED AT LAST YES I SHOWED HER EVERYTHING
THAT THEY WILL SUBDUE SUCH A FINE SPIRIT AS YOURS UNUSED TO OPPOSITION AND TELL IT NOT IN GATH YOU MUST BE MISSUS SOLMES MEAN TIME IT IS NOW EASY AS YOU WILL OBSERVE
AN ADMIRER OF CLARISSA FAVOURED BY HER FRIENDS
AS NOT TO HAVE FREEDOM OF SPIRITS ENOUGH TO ENTER UPON THE TASK YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE ALL ADMIRE YOUR OPINION ON SUCH TOPICS WHICH EVER PRODUCES SOMETHING NEW AND INSTRUCTIVE AS YOU HANDLE THE SUBJECTS AND PRAY TELL US
BUT TO YOU WHAT AN INEXCUSABLE PRESUMPTION YET I AM AFRAID ALL OPPOSITION WILL BE IN VAIN YOU MUST YOU WILL I DOUBT BE SACRIFICED TO THIS ODIOUS MAN I KNOW YOUR FAMILY
DIFFERENT PERSONS AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED HAVE BEEN OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS
AS HAVE NOT ALLOWED YOU TO ATTEND TO THE THROBS OR IF YOU HAD THEM A LITTLE NOW AND THEN WHETHER HAVING HAD TWO ACCOUNTS TO PLACE THEM TO
FROM WOMAN TO ANGEL AS SUCH IS SHE OFTEN ESTEEMED BY THE MAN WHOSE HEART WAS SO CORRUPT THAT HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HUMAN NATURE CAPABLE OF THE PURITY WHICH ON EVERY TRIAL OR TEMPTATION
WRITERS WHOSE SUBJECTS AND CHARACTERS HAVE LESS WARRANTED THE LIBERTIES THEY HAVE TAKEN IN THE LETTERS OF THE TWO YOUNG LADIES IT IS PRESUMED
THAT HE IS A COMPLETE MASTER OF SHORT HAND WRITING BY THE WAY WHAT INDUCEMENTS COULD A SWIFT WRITER AS HE HAVE TO LEARN SHORT HAND SHE SAYS AND WE KNOW IT AS WELL AS SHE
TO KEEP IN YOUR OWN HANDS THE ESTATE BEQUEATHED TO YOU BY YOUR GRANDFATHER HAD YOU DONE SO IT WOULD HAVE PROCURED YOU AT LEAST AN OUTWARD RESPECT FROM YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THEM CONCEAL THE ENVY AND ILL WILL
MODESTY AFTER ALL PERHAPS HAS A CONCERN IN IT FOR HOW SHOULD THEY THINK THAT A NIECE OR SISTER OF THEIRS I WILL NOT GO HIGHER FOR FEAR OF INCURRING YOUR DISPLEASURE SHOULD BE AN ANGEL
ANTONY HARLOWE THIRD BROTHER
HAUGHTY AS IT CERTAINLY IS
COULD NEVER HAVE SUBMITTED TO TAKE LONG OR GREAT PAINS IN ATTAINING THE QUALIFICATIONS HE IS MASTER OF QUALIFICATIONS SO SELDOM ATTAINED BY YOUTH OF QUALITY AND FORTUNE BY SUCH ESPECIALLY
THAT HE IS NOTORIOUSLY NAY AVOWEDLY A MAN OF PLEASURE YET SAYS THAT IN ANY THING HE SETS HIS HEART UPON OR UNDERTAKES HE IS THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS AND PERSEVERING MORTAL UNDER THE SUN
IN BEING THOUGHT WORSE THAN HE IS BOTH VERY BAD AND THREATENING INDICATIONS SINCE THE FIRST MUST SHEW HIM TO BE UTTERLY ABANDONED AND IT IS BUT NATURAL TO CONCLUDE FROM THE OTHER
AS YOU AND I HAVE HEARD HIM SAY HE FREQUENTLY DOES THAT IS THE STRANGE THING
THE EVENTS AT THE TIME GENERALLY DUBIOUS SO THAT THEY ABOUND NOT ONLY IN CRITICAL SITUATIONS BUT WITH WHAT MAY BE CALLED INSTANTANEOUS DESCRIPTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
RICHARD MOWBRAY THOMAS DOLEMAN JAMES TOURVILLE
AS TO YOUR CHANGE OF STYLE TO YOUR UNCLES AND BROTHER AND SISTER SINCE THEY WERE SO FOND OF ATTRIBUTING TO YOU A REGARD FOR LOVELACE AND WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO THE CONTRARY AND SINCE YOU ONLY STRENGTHENED THEIR ARGUMENTS AGAINST YOURSELF BY DENYING IT
IN BEING SO CARELESS AS HE IS OF HIS REPUTATION I THINK A MAN CAN BE SO BUT FROM ONE OF THESE TWO REASONS EITHER THAT HE IS CONSCIOUS HE DESERVES THE ILL SPOKEN OF HIM OR THAT HE TAKES A PRIDE
WHO HAPPENED TO BE BORN THIRTY YEARS BEFORE ONE OF YOUR UNCLES I SPEAK
HOW THE CAUSE FOR IT WILL COME ON WHY SHOULD IT BE PERMITTED TO STEAL UPON YOU AND YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER WHEN WE GET A GREAT COLD WE ARE APT TO PUZZLE OURSELVES TO FIND OUT WHEN IT BEGAN OR HOW WE GOT IT
SUCH STROKES OF GAYETY FANCY AND HUMOUR AS WILL ENTERTAIN AND DIVERT AND AT THE SAME TIME BOTH WARN AND INSTRUCT ALL THE LETTERS ARE WRITTEN WHILE THE HEARTS OF THE WRITERS MUST BE SUPPOSED TO BE WHOLLY ENGAGED IN THEIR SUBJECTS
AGAINST PREFERRING A MAN OF PLEASURE TO A MAN OF PROBITY UPON THAT DANGEROUS BUT TOO COMMONLY RECEIVED NOTION
HAVE EVERY ONE'S ILL WORD AND SO INDEED THEY OUGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY SOLICITOUS TO KEEP THAT WHICH THEY PREFER TO EVERY ONE'S GOOD ONE COVETOUS INDEED WOULD THEY BE WHO DESERVED NEITHER YET EXPECTED BOTH
AND AS STRENGTHENED BY A BROTHER WHO HAS SUCH AN ASCENDANT OVER THE WHOLE FAMILY AND WHOSE INTEREST SLAVE TO IT AS HE ALWAYS WAS ENGAGED HIM TO RUIN YOU WITH EVERY ONE BOTH POSSESSED OF THE EARS OF ALL YOUR FAMILY
AND WE CAN SCRIBBLE UPON TWENTY INNOCENT SUBJECTS AND TAKE DELIGHT IN THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE INNOCENT THOUGH WERE THEY TO BE SEEN
THAT THESE PRESUMERS APPEAR NOT IN THIS VERY UNWORTHY LIGHT TO SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS IS BECAUSE THEIR DEFECTS ARE NOT SO STRIKING TO THEM AS TO OTHERS AND WHY SHALL I VENTURE TO TELL YOU
LET US SEE WHAT THEIR NEXT STEP WILL BE AS TO LOVELACE WHILE HE TELLS HIS OWN STORY
AN ADMIRER OF MISS HOWE LORD M UNCLE TO MISTER LOVELACE
BEING VERILY PERSUADED THAT ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WOULD HAVE YIELDED BY THIS TIME AND THEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD SOME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY TO FOUND MY OBSERVATIONS UPON AND INDEED WHAT CAN I WRITE
AND THERE'S NO MORE TO BE SAID ONLY MY DEAR I SHALL KEEP A GOOD LOOK OUT UPON YOU
THAT A BRAVE A LEARNED AND A DILIGENT MAN CANNOT BE NATURALLY A BAD MAN
HE RESTS IT SEEMS NOT ABOVE SIX HOURS IN THE TWENTY FOUR ANY MORE THAN YOU HE DELIGHTS IN WRITING
AND THEN THE FLOWER DROOPED PALE AND SCENTLESS THE FAIRY BELL RANG MOURNFULLY ANNIE WOULD FORGET HER BETTER RESOLUTIONS AND BE AGAIN A SELFISH WILFUL LITTLE CHILD AT LAST SHE TRIED NO LONGER BUT GREW ANGRY WITH THE FAITHFUL FLOWER
THEN TOUCHING THE CHILD WITH HER SHINING WAND THE FAIRY BID HER LOOK AND LISTEN SILENTLY
NOR WEAR THIS WITHERED FLOWER LONGER SO OUT INTO THE FIELDS SHE WENT WHERE THE LONG GRASS RUSTLED AS SHE PASSED AND TIMID BIRDS LOOKED AT HER FROM THEIR NESTS
WHILE THE TEARS BEGAN TO FALL AGAIN I AM NOT HAPPY FOR I AM NOT
THEN WITH A KIND FAREWELL THE GENTLE FAIRY FLOATED UPWARD THROUGH THE SUNNY AIR SMILING DOWN UPON THE CHILD UNTIL SHE VANISHED IN THE SOFT WHITE CLOUDS AND LITTLE ANNIE STOOD ALONE IN HER ENCHANTED GARDEN
AND THUS RENDERED A PLEASANT SUMMER HOME FOR THE GENTLE HAPPY CHILD WHOSE BOSOM FLOWER WILL NEVER FADE AND NOW DEAR ANNIE I MUST GO BUT EVERY SPRINGTIME WITH THE EARLIEST FLOWERS WILL I COME AGAIN TO VISIT YOU AND BRING SOME FAIRY GIFT
AND LEFT THE CHILD ALONE THE LIGHT AND PERFUME OF THE FLOWER SEEMED TO BRING NEW STRENGTH TO ANNIE AND SHE ROSE UP SAYING AS SHE BENT TO KISS THE BLOSSOM ON HER BREAST DEAR FLOWER HELP AND GUIDE ME NOW AND I WILL LISTEN TO YOUR VOICE
AND LET THE SHINING SPIRITS MAKE YOUR HEART THEIR HOME AND WITH THAT VOICE SOUNDING IN HER EAR LITTLE ANNIE WOKE TO FIND IT WAS A DREAM BUT LIKE OTHER DREAMS IT DID NOT PASS AWAY AND AS SHE SAT ALONE BATHED IN THE ROSY MORNING LIGHT AND WATCHED THE FOREST WAKEN INTO LIFE
THEN AS THE FAIRY SAID SHE FOUND A SWEET REWARD IN THE STRANGE SOFT PERFUME OF THE MAGIC BLOSSOM AS IT SHONE UPON HER BREAST BUT SELFISH THOUGHTS WOULD COME TO TEMPT HER SHE WOULD YIELD AND UNKIND WORDS FELL FROM HER LIPS
OTHERS WITH SULLEN ANXIOUS LOOKS SEEMED GATHERING UP ALL THEY COULD REACH AND ANNIE SAW THAT THE MORE THEY GAINED THE LESS THEY SEEMED TO HAVE AND THESE SHE KNEW WERE SHAPES OF SELFISHNESS SPIRITS OF PRIDE WERE THERE
APPEARED THE SMILING FACE OF THE LOVELY ELF WHOSE COMING SHE HAD WAITED FOR SO LONG DEAR ANNIE LOOK FOR ME NO LONGER I AM HERE ON YOUR OWN BREAST
LITTLE ANNIE LOOK AND SEE THE EVIL THINGS THAT YOU ARE CHERISHING I WILL CLOTHE IN FITTING SHAPES THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS THAT NOW DWELL WITHIN YOUR HEART AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW GREAT THEIR POWER BECOMES UNLESS YOU BANISH THEM FOR EVER THEN ANNIE SAW WITH FEAR AND WONDER
WHAT TO YOU IS NOW SO FULL OF MUSIC AND OF LIGHT TO OTHERS IS BUT A PLEASANT SUMMER WORLD THEY NEVER KNOW THE LANGUAGE OF BUTTERFLY OR BIRD OR FLOWER AND THEY ARE BLIND TO ALL THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE POWER TO SEE THESE FAIR THINGS ARE YOUR FRIENDS AND PLAYMATES NOW
THE FLOWERS NODDED WISELY ON THEIR STEMS BUT DID NOT SPEAK WHILE BUTTERFLY AND BEE BUZZED AND FLUTTERED AWAY ONE FAR TOO BUSY THE OTHER TOO IDLE TO STAY AND TELL HER WHAT SHE ASKED THEN SHE WENT THROUGH BROAD FIELDS OF YELLOW GRAIN
THEN SHE COULD HEAR NO MORE BUT SINKING DOWN AMONG THE WITHERED FLOWERS WEPT SAD AND BITTER TEARS FOR HER LOST LIBERTY AND JOY THEN THROUGH THE GLOOM THERE SHONE A FAINT SOFT LIGHT
CLEARER AND BRIGHTER GREW THE
WHY ARE THESE GREAT DROPS SHINING ON THE FLOWERS
SHE LISTENED ONLY TO THE MUSIC OF THE FAIRY BELL AND THE UNKIND THOUGHT OR FEELING FLED AWAY THE SMILING SPIRITS OF GENTLENESS AND LOVE NESTLED IN HER HEART AND ALL WAS BRIGHT AGAIN SO BETTER AND HAPPIER GREW THE CHILD
BUT WHEN AN UNKIND WORD IS ON YOUR LIPS WHEN A SELFISH ANGRY FEELING RISES IN YOUR HEART OR AN UNKIND CRUEL DEED IS TO BE DONE
EARTH AND AIR SEEMED FILLED WITH BEAUTY AND WITH MUSIC SHE HAD NEVER DREAMED OF UNTIL NOW
AND AM COME TO HELP AND COMFORT YOU NOW TELL ME WHY YOU WEEP AND LET ME BE YOUR FRIEND REPLIED THE SPIRIT AS SHE SMILED MORE KINDLY STILL ON ANNIE'S WONDERING FACE
AND THEY WILL TEACH YOU MANY PLEASANT LESSONS AND GIVE YOU MANY HAPPY HOURS WHILE THE GARDEN WHERE YOU ONCE SAT WEEPING SAD AND BITTER TEARS IS NOW BRIGHTENED BY YOUR OWN HAPPINESS FILLED WITH LOVING FRIENDS BY YOUR OWN KINDLY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS
WEARY WITH GAZING AT THE FAR OFF SKY FOR THE LITTLE FORM SHE HOPED WOULD COME SHE BENT TO LOOK WITH JOYFUL LOVE UPON HER BOSOM FLOWER AND AS SHE LOOKED ITS FOLDED LEAVES SPREAD WIDE APART AND RISING SLOWLY FROM THE DEEP WHITE CUP
THE TALL TREES AS THEIR BRANCHES RUSTLED IN THE WIND SANG A LOW DREAMY SONG WHILE THE WAVING GRASS WAS FILLED WITH LITTLE VOICES SHE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE BUTTERFLIES WHISPERED LOVELY TALES IN HER EAR AND BIRDS SANG CHEERFUL SONGS IN A SWEET LANGUAGE SHE HAD NEVER UNDERSTOOD BEFORE
O KIND AND GENEROUS FAIRY HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU FOR THIS LOVELY GIFT CRIED ANNIE I WILL BE TRUE AND LISTEN TO MY LITTLE BELL WHENEVER IT MAY RING BUT SHALL I NEVER SEE YOU MORE AH
THIS IS A FAIRY FLOWER SAID THE ELF INVISIBLE TO EVERY EYE SAVE YOURS
WITH EACH DAY'S SUN AND DEW GROWING STILL MORE BEAUTIFUL AND BRIGHT BUT THE FAIRY FLOWER THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LOVELIEST OF ALL HUNG PALE AND DROOPING ON LITTLE ANNIE'S BOSOM ITS FRAGRANCE SEEMED QUITE GONE AND THE CLEAR LOW MUSIC OF ITS WARNING CHIME RANG OFTEN IN HER EAR
BUT AFTER EACH NEW TRIAL BRIGHTER SHONE HER MAGIC FLOWER AND SWEETER GREW ITS BREATH WHILE THE SPIRITS LOST STILL MORE THEIR POWER TO TEMPT HER MEANWHILE GREEN FLOWERING VINES CREPT UP THE HIGH DARK WALL AND HID ITS ROUGHNESS FROM HER SIGHT
WHEN YOUR HEART IS FILLED WITH LOVING THOUGHTS WHEN SOME KINDLY DEED HAS BEEN DONE SOME DUTY WELL PERFORMED THEN FROM THE FLOWER THERE WILL ARISE THE SWEETEST SOFTEST FRAGRANCE TO REWARD AND GLADDEN YOU
I WILL GO OUT INTO THE FIELDS AND WOODS AND SEEK HER THERE
THE WARM WIND LIFTED UP HER SHINING HAIR AND SOFTLY KISSED HER CHEEK WHILE THE SUNBEAMS LOOKING MOST KINDLY IN HER FACE MADE LITTLE RAINBOWS IN HER TEARS AND LINGERED LOVINGLY ABOUT HER BUT ANNIE PAID NO HEED TO SUN OR WIND OR FLOWER
THAT THE ANGRY WORDS SHE UTTERED CHANGED TO DARK UNLOVELY FORMS EACH SHOWING PLAINLY FROM WHAT FAULT OR PASSION IT HAD SPRUNG SOME OF THE SHAPES HAD SCOWLING FACES AND BRIGHT FIERY EYES
THEN THE GENTLE FAIRY FOLDED HER LITTLE ARMS AROUND ANNIE'S NECK LAID A SOFT KISS ON HER CHEEK
AUTUMN FLOWERS WERE DEAD AND GONE YELLOW LEAVES LAY RUSTLING ON THE GROUND BLEAK WINDS WENT WHISTLING THROUGH THE NAKED TREES AND COLD WHITE WINTER SNOW FELL SOFTLY DOWN YET NOW WHEN ALL WITHOUT LOOKED DARK AND DREARY
WHAT THE PURPOSE OR NATURE OF THE GENERAL EXODUS WE DID NOT KNOW BUT PRESENTLY THROUGH THE LINE OF CAPTIVES RAN THE RUMOR THAT TWO ESCAPED SLAVES HAD BEEN RECAPTURED A MAN AND A WOMAN AND THAT WE WERE MARCHING TO WITNESS THEIR PUNISHMENT
WITHIN PELLUCIDAR ONE TIME IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER THERE WERE NO NIGHTS TO MASK OUR ATTEMPTED ESCAPE ALL MUST BE DONE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ALL BUT THE WORK I HAD TO DO IN THE APARTMENT BENEATH THE BUILDING
AND SO I IMAGINE THAT SAGOTHS FELT AMPLY JUSTIFIED IN MAKING THE ENTIRE PROCEEDING AS UNCOMFORTABLE AND PAINFUL TO US AS POSSIBLE THEY JABBED US WITH THEIR SPEARS AND STRUCK AT US WITH THE HATCHETS AT THE LEAST PROVOCATION AND AT NO PROVOCATION AT ALL
REPTILES THAT THEY ARE THE ROUGH SURFACE OF A GREAT STONE IS TO THEM AS PLUSH AS UPHOLSTERY TO US HERE THEY LOLLED BLINKING THEIR HIDEOUS EYES AND DOUBTLESS CONVERSING WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THEIR SIXTH SENSE FOURTH DIMENSION LANGUAGE
OF MEASURED MOVEMENTS RESULTING IN A CADENCE WHICH EVIDENTLY PLEASED THE EYE OF THE MAHAR AS THE CADENCE OF OUR OWN INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLEASES OUR EARS SOMETIMES THE BAND TOOK MEASURED STEPS IN UNISON TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER OR BACKWARD AND AGAIN FORWARD
I OFTEN WONDERED IF THE LITTLE PARTY OF FUGITIVES HAD BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THE GUARDS WHO HAD RETURNED TO SEARCH FOR THEM
IN ONE OF HIS MIGHTY SPRINGS COMPLETELY OVER THE BARRIER INTO THE MIDST OF THE SLAVES AND SAGOTHS JUST IN FRONT OF US SWINGING HIS BLOODY HORNS FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE BEAST CUT A WIDE SWATH BEFORE HIM STRAIGHT UPWARD TOWARD OUR SEATS
HAVE NEVER INDICATED A SIZE GREATER THAN THAT ATTAINED BY AN ORDINARY CROW AS WE CONTINUED ON THROUGH THE MAIN AVENUE OF PHUTRA
WE HAD COMPLETED THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR OUR PROTECTION AFTER LEAVING PHUTRA WHEN THE SAGOTHS WHO HAD BEEN SENT TO RECAPTURE THE ESCAPED PRISONERS RETURNED WITH FOUR OF THEM OF WHOM HOOJA WAS ONE DIAN AND TWO OTHERS HAD ELUDED THEM
AT ONE STEP WE MAY CARRY THEM FROM THE AGE OF STONE TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IT'S MARVELOUS ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS JUST TO THINK ABOUT IT DAVID SAID THE OLD MAN I BELIEVE THAT GOD SENT US HERE FOR JUST THAT PURPOSE IT SHALL BE MY LIFE WORK TO TEACH THEM HIS WORD
TO LEAD THEM INTO THE LIGHT OF HIS MERCY WHILE WE ARE TRAINING THEIR HEARTS AND HANDS IN THE WAYS OF CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION YOU ARE RIGHT PERRY I SAID AND WHILE YOU ARE TEACHING THEM TO PRAY I'LL BE TEACHING THEM TO FIGHT AND BETWEEN US WE'LL MAKE A RACE OF MEN THAT WILL BE AN HONOR TO US BOTH
HER BACK WAS TOWARD ME FOR A WHILE AND THE SIGHT OF THE GREAT MASS OF RAVEN HAIR PILED HIGH UPON HER HEAD FILLED ME WITH ALARM PRESENTLY A DOOR IN ONE SIDE OF THE ARENA WALL WAS OPENED TO ADMIT A HUGE SHAGGY BULL LIKE CREATURE
IT WENT CAREENING ABOUT THE ARENA IN FRENZIED ATTEMPT TO UNSEAT ITS RENDING RIDER IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE GIRL AVOIDED THE FIRST MAD RUSH OF THE WOUNDED ANIMAL ALL ITS EFFORTS TO RID ITSELF OF THE TIGER SEEMED FUTILE
SCIENCE TOOK VAST STRIDES THIS WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF THE SCIENCES WHICH WE KNOW AS BIOLOGY AND EUGENICS FINALLY A CERTAIN FEMALE SCIENTIST ANNOUNCED THE FACT THAT SHE HAD DISCOVERED A METHOD WHEREBY EGGS MIGHT BE FERTILIZED BY CHEMICAL MEANS
THEY PAID BUT LITTLE ATTENTION TO US PHUTRA IS LAID OUT UNDERGROUND WITH A REGULARITY THAT INDICATES REMARKABLE ENGINEERING SKILL IT IS HEWN FROM SOLID LIMESTONE STRATA THE STREETS ARE BROAD AND OF A UNIFORM HEIGHT OF TWENTY FEET
BUT FINALLY I SAW THEM SEPARATE AND EACH CREEP STEALTHILY TOWARD ONE OF THE COMBATANTS THE TIGER WAS NOW UPON THE BULL'S BROAD BACK CLINGING TO THE HUGE NECK WITH POWERFUL FANGS WHILE ITS LONG STRONG TALONS RIPPED THE HEAVY HIDE INTO SHREDS AND RIBBONS
AMONG THEMSELVES THEY COMMUNICATE BY MEANS OF WHAT PERRY SAYS MUST BE A SIXTH SENSE WHICH IS COGNIZANT OF A FOURTH DIMENSION I NEVER DID QUITE GRASP HIM
HASTENING BACK TO PERRY WHERE HE PORED OVER A MUSTY PILE OF TO ME MEANINGLESS HIEROGLYPHICS I EXPLAINED MY PLAN TO HIM TO MY SURPRISE HE WAS HORRIFIED IT WOULD BE MURDER DAVID HE CRIED
ONLY THE SAGOTHS WOULD THEN STAND BETWEEN THEM AND ABSOLUTE SUPREMACY AND I WAS NOT QUITE SURE BUT THAT THE SAGOTHS OWED ALL THEIR POWER TO THE GREATER INTELLIGENCE OF THE MAHARS I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE GORILLA LIKE BEASTS WERE THE MENTAL SUPERIORS OF THE HUMAN RACE OF PELLUCIDAR
FOR THE HUMAN RACE OF PELLUCIDAR AT THE SAME TIME LISTEN I HAVE LEARNED MUCH OF A MOST SURPRISING NATURE FROM THESE ARCHIVES OF THE MAHARS
AT THE SOUND OF THE ROARING OF THE TIGER THE BULL'S BELLOWING BECAME A VERITABLE FRENZY OF RAGEFUL NOISE NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD I HEARD SUCH AN INFERNAL DIN AS THE TWO BRUTES MADE AND TO THINK IT WAS ALL LOST UPON THE HIDEOUS REPTILES FOR WHOM THE SHOW WAS STAGED
BUT THIS WE MAY NEVER KNOW THEY LOOK UPON US AS WE LOOK UPON THE BEASTS OF OUR FIELDS AND I LEARN FROM THEIR WRITTEN RECORDS THAT OTHER RACES OF MAHARS FEED UPON MEN THEY KEEP THEM IN GREAT DROVES AS WE KEEP CATTLE THEY BREED THEM MOST CAREFULLY AND WHEN THEY ARE QUITE FAT
I SUGGESTED TO PERRY THAT WE WERE IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF PHUTRA BUT LATER AS HE COMMENCED TO DISCOVER THE KEY TO THEIR WRITTEN LANGUAGE HE ASSURED ME THAT WE WERE HANDLING THE ANCIENT ARCHIVES OF THE RACE
I COULD NOT AT FIRST SEE THE BEAST FROM WHICH EMANATED THIS FEARSOME CHALLENGE BUT THE SOUND HAD THE EFFECT OF BRINGING THE TWO VICTIMS AROUND WITH A SUDDEN START AND THEN I SAW THE GIRL'S FACE SHE WAS NOT DIAN I COULD HAVE WEPT FOR RELIEF AND NOW AS THE TWO STOOD FROZEN IN TERROR
WHEN IT PASSED ON HE TURNED TO ME A RHAMPHORHYNCHUS OF THE MIDDLE OLITIC DAVID HE SAID BUT GAD HOW ENORMOUS
IT ALL SEEMED VERY SILLY AND MEANINGLESS TO ME BUT AT THE END OF THE FIRST PIECE THE MAHARS UPON THE ROCKS SHOWED THE FIRST INDICATIONS OF ENTHUSIASM THAT I HAD SEEN DISPLAYED BY THE DOMINANT RACE OF PELLUCIDAR THEY BEAT THEIR GREAT WINGS UP AND DOWN
THE GREAT CAT CLAWED AT THE SHAGGY HEAD UNTIL EYES AND EARS WERE GONE AND NAUGHT BUT A FEW STRIPS OF RAGGED BLOODY FLESH REMAINED UPON THE SKULL YET THROUGH ALL THE AGONY OF THAT FEARFUL PUNISHMENT THE THAG STILL STOOD MOTIONLESS PINNING DOWN HIS ADVERSARY
AND ITS COAT LONG AND SHAGGY AS A MOUNTAIN GOAT THAT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL THERE IS NO GAINSAYING BUT IF ITS SIZE AND COLORS ARE MAGNIFIED HERE WITHIN PELLUCIDAR SO IS THE FEROCITY OF ITS DISPOSITION
AS I HAVE BUT THEY BELONG TO ME THEY SHOULD NOT BE KEPT IN A PRIVATE HOUSE LIKE THIS AT ALL IF THEY ARE WORTH ALL THAT MONEY IF I WERE TO LET THEM GO MISTER CAMPERDOWN WOULD GET THEM
AND WHERE I'M NOT BUT IT'LL BE ABOUT THE FIRST AND THE LAST VISIT AND AS FOR BRINGING THOSE DOWDY GIRLS OUT IN LONDON IT'S THE LAST THING I SHALL THINK OF DOING INDEED I DOUBT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD TO DRESS THEMSELVES
THAT IT WAS SO EVEN THOUGH HE WAS ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE VALUE OF THE STONES DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS WORTH HE ASKED LIZZIE
EVERYWHERE WAS VARIETY IN UNIFORMITY IT WAS A PIECE OF COMPOSITION IN WHICH THE MOST FASTIDIOUSLY CRITICAL TASTE
I THINK SAID HE AT LAST THAT
SO THAT SHE MIGHT PUT HER HAND UPON IT AT ONCE
THESE YET AGAIN BY STILL MORE GRACEFUL AND MORE MODEST VARIETIES THE WHOLE FACE OF THE SOUTHERN DECLIVITY WAS COVERED WITH WILD SHRUBBERY ALONE AN OCCASIONAL SILVER WILLOW OR WHITE POPLAR EXCEPTED
AND WOULD BREAK IT OFF AND NOW SHE WAS STAMPING HER LITTLE FEET AND CLENCHING HER LITTLE HANDS AND SWEARING TO HERSELF BY ALL HER GODS THAT THIS WRETCHED TIMID LORDLING SHOULD NOT GET OUT OF HER NET
THE SUN HAD MADE ITS WAY DOWN BEHIND THE GENTLE HILLS AND THENCE
I SHA'N'T DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND SAID LIZZIE SIR FLORIAN EUSTACE GAVE THEM TO ME AND I SHALL KEEP THEM SHE DID NOT LOOK AT HER LOVER AS SHE SPOKE
AND WITHOUT A WIFE'S FORTUNE
OUGHT THEY IF YOU HAD BEEN MARRIED BEFORE AND YOUR WIFE HAD GIVEN YOU A KEEPSAKE TO KEEP FOR EVER AND EVER WOULD YOU GIVE IT UP TO A LAWYER YOU WOULD NOT LIKE IT WOULD YOU FREDERIC SHE HAD PUT HER HAND ON HIS
IT WAS NOT THE AMOUNT BUT THE CHARACTER OF THE ART WHICH CAUSED ME TO TAKE A SEAT ON ONE OF THE BLOSSOMY STONES AND GAZE UP AND DOWN THIS FAIRY LIKE AVENUE FOR HALF AN HOUR OR MORE IN BEWILDERED ADMIRATION ONE THING BECAME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THE LONGER I GAZED
I KNEW NOT HERE WAS ART UNDOUBTEDLY THAT DID NOT SURPRISE ME ALL ROADS IN THE ORDINARY SENSE ARE WORKS OF ART NOR CAN I SAY THAT THERE WAS MUCH TO WONDER AT IN THE MERE EXCESS OF ART MANIFESTED
AND MISS MACNULTY DID NOT COMPREHEND THE DEPTH OF THE IGNORANCE OF HER PATRONESS THUS THE LIES WHICH LIZZIE TOLD WERE AMAZING TO MISS MACNULTY TO SAY THAT LORD FAWN WAS IN THE CABINET WHEN
HER LETTER THEREFORE TO MISSUS EUSTACE
AND ALMOST OF DISMAY AN ACTION FOR THE RECOVERY OF JEWELS BROUGHT AGAINST THE LADY WHOM HE WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY
OR BROOCH OR PERHAPS A BRACELET A LOVER OR A LOVING LORD MAY BRING IN HIS POCKET BUT SUCH AN ORNAMENT AS THIS ON WHICH LORD FAWN WAS NOW LOOKING IS GIVEN IN ANOTHER SORT OF WAY HE FELT SURE
SPRINGING FROM A GROUP OF ROCKS IN THE VERY JAWS OF THE RAVINE AND THROWING ITS GRACEFUL BODY AT AN ANGLE OF NEARLY FORTY FIVE DEGREES FAR OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE OF THE AMPHITHEATRE ABOUT THIRTY YARDS EAST OF THIS TREE STOOD
I AM GOING TO BE MARRIED AGAIN OF COURSE
ALTHOUGH IN FACT THE NEIGHBORHOOD PERHAPS ON ACCOUNT OF BEING MORE PICTURESQUE THAN FERTILE WAS VERY SPARSELY INHABITED AT ALL EVENTS WITH MY KNAPSACK FOR A PILLOW AND MY HOUND AS A SENTRY
UPON THE WHOLE AVERSE TO MATRIMONY SHE HAD TOLD MISS MACNULTY OF HER PROSPECTS
BUT HE SAYS THEY BELONG TO THE FAMILY HE'LL SAY ANYTHING SAID LIZZIE MY DEAREST GIRL THERE CAN'T BE A MORE RESPECTABLE MAN THAN MISTER CAMPERDOWN YOU MUST DO SOMETHING OF THE KIND YOU KNOW
HERE GENERALLY THE SLOPES WERE NOTHING MORE THAN GENTLE INCLINATIONS EXTENDING FROM EAST TO WEST ABOUT
SALVATORISH IN CHARACTER THEN HE SAW THE GENTLER ELM SUCCEEDED BY THE SASSAFRAS AND LOCUST THESE AGAIN BY THE SOFTER LINDEN RED BUD CATALPA AND MAPLE
THE IDEA OF RAMBLING UP INTO OUR OWN MOUNTAINS CHARMS ME FOR NOTHING SUITS MY DISPOSITION SO WELL AS THAT KIND OF SOLITUDE OF COURSE LORD FAWN IS NOT SO RICH A MAN AS SIR FLORIAN
SHOT OUT INTO FOLIAGE THIS WAS AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT EIGHTY FEET
I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT EVEN YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING AGAINST SUCH AN ALLIANCE I AM YOUR AFFECTIONATE NIECE
AT FIRST THE SAME CLASS OF TREES
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY ITSELF FOR IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE VEGETATION HITHERTO MENTIONED GREW ONLY ON THE CLIFFS OR HILLSIDES WERE TO BE SEEN THREE INSULATED TREES
SHE DID IN TRUTH DESPISE HIM BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT CLUTCH THE JEWELS SHE LOOKED UPON HIM AS MEAN AND PALTRY BECAUSE HE WAS WILLING TO SUBMIT TO MISTER CAMPERDOWN BUT STILL SHE WAS PROMPTED TO DEMAND
THE ONE WAS CONVERSANT WITH THINGS IN GENERAL BUT WAS SLOW THE OTHER WAS QUICK AS A LIZARD IN TURNING HITHER AND THITHER BUT KNEW ALMOST NOTHING
WHETHER THE STATEMENT WAS TRUE OR FALSE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE MADE IT SO FREQUENTLY HAD HER IDEA OF THE TRUTH BEEN A FIXED IDEA IT HAD ALL BEEN EXPLAINED TO HER
BY WHAT JEWELLER A MAN HAD TO COME AND SEE THEM ABOUT SOME REPAIRS OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND POOR SIR FLORIAN WISHED IT
MUST GIVE UP SAYING THAT HE DOESN'T DO HIS WORK PROPERLY
AND THEN WENT THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS STILL BURDENED WITH A NAMELESS FOREBODING OCTAVIA STROLLED INTO THE CONSERVATORY THINKING TO REFRESH HERSELF WITH THE BALMY SILENCE WHICH PERVADED THE PLACE BUT ANNON SOON JOINED HER FULL OF A LOVER'S HOPES AND FEARS
IN ALL THAT I ENDURED THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL SUFFERING BUT OF MORAL DISTRESS AN INFINITUDE MY FANCY GREW CHARNEL I TALKED OF WORMS OF TOMBS AND EPITAPHS I WAS LOST IN REVERIES OF DEATH
THEIR WONDER THEIR RAPTUROUS ASTONISHMENT MAY BE CONCEIVED THE MOST THRILLING PECULIARITY OF THIS INCIDENT NEVERTHELESS IS INVOLVED IN WHAT MISTER S HIMSELF ASSERTS HE DECLARES THAT AT NO PERIOD WAS HE ALTOGETHER INSENSIBLE THAT DULLY AND CONFUSEDLY HE WAS AWARE OF EVERYTHING
THE BLACKNESS OF THE ABSOLUTE NIGHT THE SILENCE LIKE A SEA THAT OVERWHELMS THE UNSEEN BUT PALPABLE PRESENCE OF THE CONQUEROR WORM
ARE AT BEST SHADOWY AND VAGUE WHO SHALL SAY WHERE THE ONE ENDS AND WHERE THE OTHER BEGINS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE DISEASES IN WHICH OCCUR TOTAL CESSATIONS OF ALL THE APPARENT FUNCTIONS OF VITALITY
WHICH ARE THE WARTS OF VEGETATION STOOD A FEW PACES DISTANT FROM THE PILE OF STONES HE WENT UP TO THIS TREE AND PASSED HIS HAND OVER THE BARK OF THE TRUNK AS THOUGH SEEKING TO RECOGNIZE AND COUNT ALL THE WARTS OPPOSITE THIS TREE WHICH WAS AN ASH THERE WAS A CHESTNUT TREE
WE CAN DETECT A TORPID UNEQUAL AND VACILLATING ACTION OF THE LUNGS THEN AGAIN THE DURATION OF THE TRANCE IS FOR WEEKS EVEN FOR MONTHS WHILE THE CLOSEST SCRUTINY AND THE MOST RIGOROUS MEDICAL TESTS FAIL TO ESTABLISH ANY
IT WAS ONLY TO RUSH AT ONCE INTO A WORLD OF PHANTASMS ABOVE WHICH WITH VAST SABLE OVERSHADOWING WING
HERE COMES JASPER MAMMA SAFE AND WELL CRIED OCTAVIA AN HOUR OR TWO LATER AS SHE JOINED HER MOTHER ON THE TERRACE WHERE MY LADY HAD BEEN PACING RESTLESSLY TO AND FRO NEARLY EVER SINCE HER SON RODE AWAY WITH A SMILE OF INTENSE RELIEF SHE WAVED HER HANDKERCHIEF
AND MADE SPASMODIC EXERTIONS TO FORCE OPEN THE LID IT WOULD NOT MOVE I FELT MY WRISTS FOR THE BELL ROPE IT WAS NOT TO BE FOUND AND NOW THE COMFORTER FLED FOR EVER
NOTHING HUMAN EVER WORE A LOOK LIKE THAT OF THE GHASTLY HOLLOW EYED PALE LIPPED COUNTENANCE BELOW THE HOOD ALL SAW IT AND HELD THEIR BREATH AS IT SLOWLY RAISED A SHADOWY ARM AND POINTED A SHRIVELED FINGER AT SIR JASPER
FASHIONED UPON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE VAULT DOOR
A HUGE BELLY AND A WIDE BLUE RIBBON IT WAS THE KING OUTSIDE OF PARIS HE HELD HIS HAT DECKED WITH WHITE OSTRICH PLUMES ON HIS KNEES ENWRAPPED IN HIGH ENGLISH GAITERS
AND THERE WAS A FEEBLE STRUGGLING AND THERE WAS A GENERAL SAD UNREST AND FROM OUT THE DEPTHS OF THE COUNTLESS PITS THERE CAME A MELANCHOLY RUSTLING FROM THE GARMENTS OF THE BURIED AND OF THOSE WHO SEEMED TRANQUILLY TO REPOSE I SAW THAT A VAST NUMBER HAD CHANGED
IF HE DO NOT WISH TO OFFEND OR TO DISGUST THEY ARE WITH PROPRIETY HANDLED ONLY WHEN THE SEVERITY AND MAJESTY OF TRUTH SANCTIFY AND SUSTAIN THEM WE THRILL FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE MOST INTENSE OF PLEASURABLE PAIN OVER THE ACCOUNTS OF THE PASSAGE OF THE BERESINA
VISUAL FACULTIES AND YET IT WAS DARK ALL DARK THE INTENSE AND UTTER RAYLESSNESS OF THE NIGHT THAT ENDURETH FOR EVERMORE I ENDEAVORED TO SHRIEK AND MY LIPS AND MY PARCHED TONGUE MOVED CONVULSIVELY
UPON MY LIFE I SHOULD THINK I WAS A BOY OR A BABY BY THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU MOUNT GUARD OVER ME TODAY IF YOU THINK I'M GOING TO LIVE IN DAILY FEAR OF SOME MISHAP YOU ARE ALL MUCH MISTAKEN
AT ALL AFFECTED BY THE ONE PREVALENT MALADY UNLESS INDEED AN IDIOSYNCRASY IN MY ORDINARY SLEEP MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS SUPERINDUCED UPON AWAKING FROM SLUMBER
SHE REMAINED WITH HIM UNTIL BY SLOW DEGREES SHE FULLY RECOVERED HER ORIGINAL HEALTH HER WOMAN'S HEART WAS NOT ADAMANT AND THIS LAST LESSON OF LOVE SUFFICED TO SOFTEN IT
THE MOST FEARFUL OF SUSPICIONS FEARFUL INDEED THE SUSPICION BUT MORE FEARFUL THE DOOM IT MAY BE ASSERTED WITHOUT HESITATION THAT NO EVENT IS SO TERRIBLY WELL ADAPTED TO INSPIRE THE SUPREMENESS OF BODILY AND OF MENTAL DISTRESS AS IS BURIAL BEFORE DEATH
TOGETHER IN THE ATTEMPT BUT NO VOICE ISSUED FROM THE CAVERNOUS LUNGS WHICH OPPRESSED AS IF BY THE WEIGHT OF SOME INCUMBENT MOUNTAIN GASPED AND PALPITATED WITH THE HEART AT EVERY ELABORATE AND STRUGGLING INSPIRATION THE MOVEMENT OF THE JAWS IN THIS EFFORT TO CRY ALOUD SHOWED
WE HAVE IT IN OUR POWER TO DETECT THEM WE MUST ADMIT THAT THEY MAY FREQUENTLY OCCUR WITHOUT OUR COGNIZANCE SCARCELY IN TRUTH IS A GRAVEYARD EVER ENCROACHED UPON FOR ANY PURPOSE TO ANY GREAT EXTENT THAT SKELETONS ARE NOT FOUND IN POSTURES WHICH SUGGEST
JASPER SHE LED THEM TO THE NORTH GALLERY AND PAUSING AT THE DOOR SAID MERRILY THE GHOST OR GHOSTS RATHER FOR THERE WERE TWO WHICH FRIGHTENED PATTY
AS IF TO CONFRONT THE APPARITION ALONE OUT OF THE DARKNESS IT CAME AND IN THE FULL RADIANCE OF THE LIGHT IT PAUSED MISSUS SNOWDON BEING NEAREST SAW THE FACE FIRST AND UTTERING A FAINT CRY DROPPED DOWN UPON THE STONE FLOOR COVERING UP HER EYES
HE ASKED EAGERLY FORGIVE ME IF I GIVE YOU AN UNWELCOME REPLY BUT I MUST BE TRUE AND SO REGRETFULLY REFUSE THE HONOR YOU DO ME SHE SAID SORROWFULLY MAY I ASK WHY BECAUSE I DO NOT LOVE YOU
IT IS NIGHT ALL THE HOUSES ARE SHUT HE DOES NOT ENTER THE INN AND HE IS NOT TO BE FOUND SO HE HAS DIVED THROUGH THE EARTH THE MAN HAD NOT PLUNGED INTO THE EARTH BUT HE HAD GONE WITH GREAT STRIDES THROUGH THE DARK DOWN THE PRINCIPAL STREET OF CHELLES
AND WHEN ALL WENT WELL I FANCIED I WAS SAFE BUT MY UNCLE DISCOVERED IT SECRETLY SAID NOTHING AND BELIEVING MAURICE THE FORGER DISINHERITED HIM I NEVER KNEW THIS TILL THE OLD MAN DIED AND THEN IT WAS TOO LATE I CONFESSED TO MAURICE AND HE FORGAVE ME HE SAID
I READ NO NIGHT THOUGHTS NO FUSTIAN ABOUT CHURCHYARDS NO BUGABOO TALES SUCH AS THIS IN SHORT I BECAME A NEW MAN AND LIVED A MAN'S LIFE FROM THAT MEMORABLE NIGHT I DISMISSED FOREVER MY
BUT NO ONE HAD HEART FOR FURTHER GAIETY AND FINDING LADY TREHERNE ALREADY ALARMED BY ANNON THEY WERE FORCED TO TELL HER ALL
AND THE GYPSY HAD TO TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN AT LAST HER ARMS GREW SO TIRED THAT WHEN SHE DID MANAGE TO GET THE CAN PROPERLY UNDER THE WATER SHE HAD NO STRENGTH TO PULL IT UP AND IT ROLLED TO THE BOTTOM ON SEEING THE CAN DISAPPEAR
BUT AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER HE LET HIMSELF SLIDE TO THE EARTH AND LAY DOWN BESIDE HIS HORSE HIS THROAT BURNING HIS CHEST HEAVING AND HIS HEAD GOING ROUND ALREADY
SCORCHING IN THE SUN HERE HE WAS SEIZED WITH DREADFUL THIRST HE TOOK HIS GOURD AND RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS BUT THE GOURD WAS EMPTY IN THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS JOY HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO FILL IT HE RODE ON STRUGGLING WITH HIS SUFFERINGS
HOWEVER HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO LET THIS BIRD FLY AWAY SO HE TOOK UP SOME WATER IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND AND HELD IT TO ITS BEAK SCARCELY HAD THE CANARY DRUNK WHEN SHE BECAME A BEAUTIFUL GIRL TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A POPLAR TREE WITH BLACK EYES AND A GOLDEN SKIN
COARSE HAIR AND A SKIN NOT GOLDEN LIKE THAT OF ZIZI
IF YOU DON'T BRING IT BACK FULL YOUR BONES SHALL SUFFER FOR IT
WHOM HE LOVED VERY MUCH ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT IN THE LEAST ALIKE FOR THE YOUNG PRINCE WAS AS THIN AS A CUCKOO AND WHAT VEXED HIM MORE THAN ALL WAS THAT THOUGH THE YOUNG LADIES THROUGHOUT ALL HIS LANDS DID THEIR BEST TO MAKE THE PRINCE FALL IN LOVE WITH THEM HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ANY OF THEM
POOR GIRL HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF IT IS NOT HER FAULT AFTER ALL THAT SHE HAS GROWN SO UGLY IT IS MINE OH WHY DID I NOT FOLLOW THE OLD MAN'S ADVICE WHY DID I LEAVE HER ALONE AND BESIDES IT DEPENDS ON ME TO BREAK THE SPELL
AND TO BEG HIS LORD TO HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE TUBBY SHOWED HIS PATIENCE BY ABUSING HIS SON AS IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH HE GRUMBLED BETWEEN HIS TEETH THAT THE BOY SHOULD PICK UP A HAG WITHOUT A PENNY BUT THE GOOSE MUST GO AND BURN NOW
WHERE DWELLS A HORRIBLE WITCH WHO ALLOWS NO LIVING BEING TO ENTER THE DOORS BEHIND THE CASTLE IS THE ORANGE GROVE FOLLOW THE WALL TILL YOU COME TO A HEAVY IRON GATE DON'T TRY TO PRESS IT OPEN BUT OIL THE HINGES WITH THIS
NO I DON'T MEAN TO BE A BEAST OF BURDEN ANY LONGER AND SHE FLUNG THE BUCKET SO HIGH IN THE AIR THAT IT STUCK IN THE BRANCHES OF AN OAK I MET A WOLF SHE TOLD THE BRICKLAYER AND I BROKE THE BUCKET ACROSS HIS NOSE
SO MUCH ASTONISHED THAT HE FORGOT HIS OWN SUFFERINGS AND TO SATISFY THE BIRD HE TOOK A SECOND ORANGE AND OPENED IT WITHOUT THINKING WHAT HE WAS DOING OUT OF IT FLEW ANOTHER CANARY AND SHE TOO BEGAN TO CRY I AM DYING OF THIRST GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK
WITH A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN LETTER SAYING THAT THESE GOLDEN FRUIT THEN UNKNOWN IN FLANDERS CAME STRAIGHT FROM A LAND WHERE THE SUN ALWAYS SHONE THAT EVENING TUBBY AND HIS SON ATE THE GOLDEN APPLES AT SUPPER AND THOUGHT THEM DELICIOUS
ALAS OUT OF IT FLEW A LITTLE CANARY JUST LIKE THE OTHERS WHO CRIED I AM THIRSTY GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK
HE HAD THE STRENGTH TO LIFT HIMSELF UP AND PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS BAG HE DREW OUT AN ORANGE AND OPENED IT WITH HIS KNIFE OUT OF IT FLEW THE PRETTIEST LITTLE FEMALE CANARY THAT EVER WAS SEEN GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK I AM DYING OF THIRST SAID THE GOLDEN BIRD
THEY ARE COMING WITH GREAT POMP TO FETCH YOU AND YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO SHOW YOURSELF TO SO MANY FINE LORDS AND LADIES WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN LIKE THAT GET DOWN AT ONCE MY POOR CHILD AND LET ME DRESS YOUR HAIR FOR YOU THE INNOCENT ZIZI CAME DOWN AT ONCE
BUT AS HIS FATHER WENT ON LAUGHING AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF STOPPING THE YOUNG MAN TOOK HIS HAND KISSED IT TENDERLY
A SCULLION WHO WAS HIDDEN OUTSIDE RUSHED OUT AND SHUT THE SHUTTERS THE BIRD FLEW INTO THE KITCHEN THEN ALL THE COOKS AND SCULLIONS SPRANG AFTER IT KNOCKING AT IT WITH THEIR APRONS AT LENGTH ONE OF THEM CAUGHT IT JUST AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT TUBBY ENTERED THE KITCHEN
WE WILL JUDGE HER CAUSE AT ONCE AND HE SEATED HIMSELF SOLEMNLY ON THE OVEN AND CONDEMNED TITTY TO BE BURNED ALIVE
SHE WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND FOR TEN YEARS OF THAT TIME THE WITCH HAD KEPT HER SHUT UP IN AN ORANGE IN THE SHAPE OF A CANARY WELL THEN MY CHARMING ZIZI SAID THE YOUNG PRINCE WHO WAS LONGING TO MARRY HER LET US RIDE AWAY QUICKLY
WAVING HIS SCEPTRE HE HAD COME TO SEE FOR HIMSELF WHY THE GOOSE HAD NEVER MADE ITS APPEARANCE THE SCULLION STOPPED AT ONCE JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO WRING THE CANARY'S NECK
HE ATE FOUR MEALS A DAY SLEPT TWELVE HOURS OUT OF THE TWENTY FOUR AND THE ONLY THING HE EVER DID WAS TO SHOOT AT SMALL BIRDS WITH HIS BOW AND ARROW STILL WITH ALL HIS PRACTICE HE SHOT VERY BADLY HE WAS SO FAT AND HEAVY
AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY
HE HAD A PLEASANT FEELING OF FRESHNESS ALL ABOUT HIM IT WAS NIGHT THE SKY WAS SPARKLING WITH STARS AND THE EARTH WAS COVERED WITH A HEAVY DEW THE TRAVELLER HAVING RECOVERED MOUNTED HIS HORSE
YOU NEVER GAVE ME ANY BREAD HE HAS GIVEN ME AS MUCH AS I WANT LET HIM GO IN PEACE IRON GATE IRON GATE CRIED THE VOICE GROWLING LIKE THUNDER FALL ON HIM AND GRIND HIM TO POWDER NO REPLIED THE GATE
THE FEAST WAS EXCELLENT BUT DESIRE HARDLY TOUCHED ANYTHING HOWEVER TO MAKE UP THE OTHER GUESTS ATE GREEDILY AND AS FOR TUBBY NOTHING EVER TOOK AWAY HIS APPETITE WHEN THE MOMENT ARRIVED TO SERVE THE ROAST GOOSE
THOUGH MOST LIKELY YOU WILL LAUGH AT ME I DREAMED THAT IN THE LAND OF THE SUN THERE WAS A WOOD FULL OF ORANGE TREES AND THAT IN ONE OF THE ORANGES I SHOULD FIND A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS WHO IS TO BE MY WIFE IT IS SHE I AM SEEKING
THEN HE WENT ON TO THE WELL DREW UP THE CORD WHICH WAS HALF ROTTEN AND STRETCHED IT OUT IN THE SUN LASTLY HE WENT ROUND THE CASTLE AND PLUNGED INTO THE ORANGE GROVE THERE HE GATHERED THE THREE MOST BEAUTIFUL ORANGES HE COULD FIND
AND THAT THE GOOSE MAY BURN SO THAT THERE MAY BE NONE LEFT FOR TITTY AND THE SCULLION FELL FAST ASLEEP AND WHEN THE MASTER COOK CAME BACK HE FOUND THE GOOSE AS BLACK AS THE CHIMNEY IN A FURY HE WOKE THE SCULLION WHO IN ORDER TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM BLAME TOLD THE WHOLE STORY
MISTER WILLIAMS HAS BEEN HERE BUT WE HAVE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TOGETHER HE SEEMED CONFOUNDED AT MISSUS JEWKES'S CHANGE OF TEMPER AND RESERVEDNESS AFTER HER KIND VISIT
O MY FOOLISH FEARS OF BULLS AND ROBBERS FOR NOW ALL MY UNEASINESS BEGINS TO DOUBLE UPON ME O WHAT HAS THIS INCAUTIOUS MAN SAID THAT NO DOUBT IS THE SUBJECT OF HER LONG LETTER
AND YOU CAN PRAY FOR HER WITH HEARTS SO SINCERE AND PURE THAT ARE NOT TO BE MET WITH IN PALACES OH
SHE GAVE NO HINTS OF THE KEY AND THE DOOR ET CETERA
AND I AM PERSUADED THAT FEAR BRINGS ONE INTO MORE DANGERS THAN THE CAUTION THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT DELIVERS ONE FROM I THEN LOCKED THE DOOR AND PUT THE KEY IN MY POCKET AND WAS IN A SAD QUANDARY
PROVIDENCE WILL NOT DESERT SUCH PIETY AND INNOCENCE AND BE THIS YOUR COMFORT AND RELIANCE
NOW TO ACCOUNT FOR HER KINDNESS TO MISTER WILLIAMS IN HER VISIT TO HIM WHICH WAS ONLY TO GET OUT OF HIM WHAT SHE COULD WHY MISSUS JEWKES SAID I IS ALL THIS FISHING ABOUT FOR SOMETHING WHERE THERE IS NOTHING
AND SEE AN END TO ALL MY TROUBLES AND ANXIETIES FORGIVE MY IMPATIENCE BUT MY PRESAGING MIND BODES HORRID MISCHIEFS EVERY THING LOOKS DARK AROUND ME AND THIS WOMAN'S IMPENETRABLE SULLENNESS AND SILENCE
O THIS WICKED WOMAN TO TRICK ME SO EVERY THING MAN WOMAN AND BEAST IS IN A PLOT AGAINST YOUR POOR PAMELA I THINK THEN I KNOW NOT ONE STEP OF THE WAY NOR HOW FAR TO ANY HOUSE OR COTTAGE
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS WITCHES AND SPIRITS IF THERE BE I BELIEVE IN MY HEART MISSUS JEWKES HAS GOT THIS BULL OF HER SIDE BUT YET WHAT COULD I DO WITHOUT MONEY OR A FRIEND'
AND SHE PULLED OUT HER KEY AND WE WALKED A LITTLE IN THE PASTURE TO LOOK AT THE BULL
AND BESIDES I SENT A LETTER AS YOU KNOW BUT HAVE HAD NO ANSWER TO IT SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT THAT HIS LETTER TO MISTER WILLIAMS WAS SUFFICIENT AND THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS TO THANK HIM IF BUT IN TWO LINES
I BEGIN TO WISH I HAD VENTURED EVERY THING AND GONE OFF WHEN I MIGHT O WHEN WILL THIS STATE OF DOUBT AND UNEASINESS END SHE HAS JUST BEEN WITH ME AND SAYS
OF SEEING YOU WITH US WHICH GOD GRANT AMEN AMEN SAY YOUR MOST INDULGENT PARENTS AMEN OUR HUMBLEST SERVICE AND THANKS TO THE WORTHY MISTER WILLIAMS AGAIN WE SAY
AND IS TO ACCOMPANY HER BROTHER TO LONDON OR MEET HIM THERE HE KNOWS NOT WHICH HE PROFESSES GREAT ZEAL AND AFFECTION TO YOUR SERVICE
I AM MORE AND MORE SATISFIED THERE IS MISCHIEF BREWING AND SHALL BEGIN TO HIDE MY PAPERS AND BE CIRCUMSPECT
BUT WHICH IS NOT COME TO MY HAND I THINK THERE CAN BE NO TREACHERY FOR IT IS A PARTICULAR FRIEND AT GAINSBOROUGH THAT I HAVE ORDERED HIM TO DIRECT TO AND THIS IS COME SAFE TO MY HANDS BY THIS MEANS
OUT OF ALL MY PURPOSES O HOW TERRIBLE EVERY THING APPEARS TO ME I HAD GOT TWICE AS FAR AGAIN
GOD BLESS HIM FOR EVER O WHAT A DEAL WE HAVE TO SAY TO YOU GOD GIVE US A HAPPY MEETING WE UNDERSTAND THE SQUIRE IS SETTING OUT FOR LONDON HE IS A FINE GENTLEMAN AND HAS WIT AT WILL
BUT THERE STOOD THAT HORRID BULL STARING ME FULL IN THE FACE WITH FIERY SAUCER EYES AS I THOUGHT SO I GOT IN AGAIN FOR FEAR HE SHOULD COME AT ME NOBODY SAW ME HOWEVER
HE SAYS IN HIS LETTER HE WAS A FRIGHTFUL SPECTACLE HE MIGHT BE SO INDEED WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN A DOORS BUT HE LOOKS WELL ENOUGH NOW AND ONLY FOR A FEW GROANS NOW AND THEN WHEN HE THINKS OF HIS DANGER
AND HE SEEMED TO TAKE ME AS I INTENDED INTIMATING THE RENEWING OF THE CORRESPONDENCE BY THE TILES
TO HELP MYSELF ANY WHERE ELSE O WHY ARE POOR FOOLISH MAIDENS TRIED WITH SUCH DANGERS WHEN THEY HAVE SUCH WEAK MINDS TO GRAPPLE WITH THEM I WILL SINCE IT IS SO HOPE THE BEST
SATURDAY SUNDAY MISTER WILLIAMS HAS BEEN HERE BOTH THESE DAYS AS USUAL BUT IS VERY INDIFFERENTLY RECEIVED STILL BY MISSUS JEWKES AND TO AVOID SUSPICION I LEFT THEM TOGETHER
WELL SAID I LET HIM HAVE SAID WHAT HE WOULD I CARE NOT FOR I AM SURE HE CAN SAY NO HARM OF ME AND SO LET US CHANGE THE TALK I WAS THE EASIER INDEED BECAUSE FOR ALL HER PUMPS
AND KNOW NOT HOW I GOT HOME I WILL WRITE A LETTER OF THANKS THIS NIGHT IF I AM ABLE TO MY KIND PATRON FOR HIS INESTIMABLE GOODNESS TO ME I WISH I WAS ENABLED TO SAY ALL I HOPE
SO MISSUS JEWKES IS RETURNED FROM HER VISIT WELL SAID SHE I WOULD HAVE YOU SET YOUR HEART AT REST FOR MISTER WILLIAMS WILL DO VERY WELL AGAIN HE IS NOT HALF SO BAD AS HE FANCIED O THESE SCHOLARS SAID SHE
WE HAVE JUST SUPPED TOGETHER ALL THREE AND I CANNOT YET THINK THAT ALL MUST BE RIGHT ONLY I AM RESOLVED NOT TO MARRY IF I CAN HELP IT AND I WILL GIVE NO ENCOURAGEMENT I AM RESOLVED AT LEAST
THAT HURT THE POOR COOK MAID WHO IS GOT PRETTY WELL AGAIN MISTER WILLIAMS POINTED AT THE SUNFLOWER BUT I WAS FORCED TO BE VERY RESERVED TO HIM FOR THE POOR GENTLEMAN HAS NO GUARD NO CAUTION AT ALL
AND WHETHER I COULD GAIN PROTECTION IF I GOT TO A HOUSE AND NOW THE ROBBERS ARE ABROAD TOO I MAY RUN INTO AS GREAT DANGER AS I WANT TO ESCAPE NAY GREATER MUCH IF THESE PROMISING APPEARANCES HOLD
NOT SO MISS CARLYLE ALL WHO HAD APPROACHED HER WITH THE LOVELORN TALE SHE SENT QUICKLY TO THE RIGHT ABOUT MISTER CARLYLE WAS SEATED IN HIS OWN PRIVATE ROOM IN HIS OFFICE THE MORNING AFTER HIS RETURN FROM TOWN HIS CONFIDENTIAL CLERK AND MANAGER STOOD NEAR HIM
CONTRIVE TO BE IN THE STREET AT FOUR THIS AFTERNOON STAY THAT'S YOUR DINNER HOUR BE WALKING UP THE STREET AT THREE THREE PRECISELY I WILL MEET YOU HE ROSE SHOOK HANDS AND ESCORTED BARBARA THROUGH THE SMALL HALL ALONG THE PASSAGE TO THE HOUSE DOOR
WHEN DISSENTING FROM A PROBLEM SHE WAS SURE THERE WAS SOME MYSTERY ASTIR SHE TURNED AND WALKED DOWN THE STREET WITH BARBARA
HE HAS BEEN DUCKED GRINNED THE YELLOWS IN ANSWER THEY HAVE BEEN AND DUCKED HIM IN THE RUSH POOL ON MISTER JUSTICE HARE'S LAND THE SOAKED AND MISERABLE MAN INCREASED HIS SPEED AS MUCH AS HIS COLD AND TREMBLING LEGS WOULD ALLOW HIM
HE WOULD HAVE BORNE ON WITHOUT LEGS AT ALL RATHER THAN REMAIN UNDER THE ENEMY'S GAZE THE ENEMY LOFTILY CONTINUED THEIR WAY THEIR HEADS IN THE AIR AND SCORNING FURTHER NOTICE ALL SAVE YOUNG LORD VANE HE HOVERED ROUND THE RANKS OF THE UNWASHED
WITH AN IRON HAND SHE LIKED TO RULE HIM NOW IN GREAT THINGS AS IN SMALL JUST AS SHE HAD DONE IN THE DAYS OF HIS BABYHOOD AND ARCHIBALD GENERALLY SUBMITTED FOR THE FORCE OF HABIT IS STRONG SHE WAS A WOMAN OF STRONG SENSE
THEY HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A PLAY ACTED FOR THEM BEFORE OUT OF THE PEA SOUP BEFORE HE WAS QUITE DEAD QUITE SENSELESS OF ALL DROWNED RATS HE LOOKED THE WORST AS HE STOOD THERE WITH HIS WHITE RUEFUL FACE
WHO OR WHAT WAS THAT OBJECT IN ADVANCE OF IT SUPPORTED BETWEEN DRAKE AND THE LAWYER AND LOOKING LIKE A DROWNED RAT HAIR HANGING LEGS TOTTERING CHEEKS SHAKING AND CLOTHES IN TATTERS
AND TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOR EVER AND EVER THAT SHE WAS WORSE TO HIM THAN NOTHING
MISS CORNY FLEW TO THE WINDOW LADY ISABEL IN HER WAKE TWO CROWDS IT MAY ALMOST BE SAID FOR FROM THE OPPOSITE WAY THE SCARLET AND PURPLE PARTY AS MISTER CARLYLE'S WAS CALLED IN ALLUSION TO HIS COLORS CAME IN VIEW
WAS THE PROMISE HELD OUT IN REPLY TO THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND THE LAWYER WHO WAS SHORT AND FAT AND COULD NOT HAVE KNOCKED A MAN DOWN HAD IT BEEN TO SAVE HIS LIFE BACKED OUT OF THE MELEE AND CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH ISSUING FORTH CONFUSED THREATENINGS OF THE TERRORS OF THE LAW
A COURTESY PROBABLY NOT YET SHOWN TO ANY CLIENT BY MISTER CARLYLE THE HOUSE DOOR CLOSED UPON HER AND BARBARA HAD TAKEN ONE STEP FROM IT WHEN SOMETHING LARGE LOOMED DOWN UPON HER LIKE A SHIP IN FULL SAIL
DROPPING THE POINT OF THE CONTEST AS TO THE PIPES YOU ARE VERY CLEVER ARCHIE BUT YOU CAN'T DO ME I ASKED BARBARA WHAT SHE CAME HERE FOR BUSINESS FOR MAMMA TOUCHING MONEY MATTERS WAS HER REPLY I ASK YOU
I NEVER SAW A CHAP SO EXCITED PETER CRIED CRIED ECHOED MISS CARLYLE WELL MA'AM YOU KNOW HE WAS VERY FOND OF LADY ISABEL WAS PETER AND SOMEHOW HIS FEELINGS OVERCAME HIM HE SAID HE HAD NOT HEARD ANYTHING TO PLEASE HIM SO MUCH FOR MANY A DAY
MISTER CARLYLE RETURNED TO HIS ROOM DELIBERATED A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN RANG HIS BELL A CLERK ANSWERED IT GO TO THE BUCK'S HEAD IF MISTER HARE AND THE OTHER MAGISTRATES ARE THERE ASK THEM TO STEP OVER TO ME THE YOUNG MAN DID AS HE WAS BID
IT IS NOTHING THAT COULD INTEREST YOU A TRIFLING MATTER RELATING TO A LITTLE MONEY IT'S NOTHING INDEED THEN IF IT'S NOTHING WHY WERE YOU CLOSETED SO LONG WITH ARCHIBALD HE WAS ASKING THE PARTICULARS REPLIED BARBARA RECOVERING HER EQUANIMITY
RICHARD ALSO WISHES FOR AN INTERVIEW IT IS ONLY NATURAL MISSUS HARE MUST BE THANKFUL TO HEAR SO FAR THAT HE IS SAFE I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT RETURNED BARBARA THE CHANGE IS AKIN TO MAGIC SHE SAYS IT HAS PUT LIFE INTO HER ANEW AND NOW FOR THE LAST THING
AND WITH THAT HE BURST OUT CRYING AND GAVE BILL WHITE HALF A CROWN OUT OF HIS POCKET
SEND IN MISS CARLYLE FIRST WAS THE ANSWER WHAT IS IT CORNELIA AH YOU MAY WELL ASK WHAT SAYING THIS MORNING THAT YOU COULD NOT DINE AT SIX AS USUAL AND THEN MARCHING OFF AND NEVER FIXING THE HOUR
NO POOR THING SHE IS GONE BEYOND ALL DOUBT AND HAS TAKEN HER SINS WITH HER CONVINCING PROOFS AND MISS CARLYLE LENT HER EAR TO THEM THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHILE MADAME VINE WAS AT BREAKFAST MISTER CARLYLE ENTERED
SHE SAILED ON WITH HER HEAD UP THOUGH IT WAS TURNED OCCASIONALLY TO LOOK AT THE FACE OF MADAME VINE AT THE DEEP DISTRESSING BLUSH WHICH THIS GAZE CALLED INTO HER CHEEKS IT'S VERY ODD THOUGHT MISS CORNY THE LIKENESS ESPECIALLY IN THE EYES IS
AND PUTTING GRAVER CONSIDERATIONS ASIDE THAT WOULD BE PLEASANT FOR NEITHER YOU NOR FOR ME TO HAVE A CONNECTION GIBBETED FOR A WILLFUL MURDER WOULD BE AN UGLY BLOT ON THE CARLYLE ESCUTCHEON CORNELIA
DUCK HIM THE POND BE CLOSE AT HAND LET'S GIVE HIM A TASTE OF HIS DESERVINGS
NO WONDER POOR BARBARA WAS FLURRIED AND NERVOUS FOR THERE'S DANGER ON ALL SIDES IS HE AT THEIR HOUSE HOW COULD HE BE THERE AND HIS FATHER IN IT
MISS CORNY PAUSED WHAT IS YOUR CHRISTIAN NAME MADAME BEGAN SHE AGAIN JANE REPLIED MADAME POPPING OUT AN UNFLINCHING STORY IN HER ALARM HERE HERE WHAT'S UP WHAT'S THIS
AND THAT THE SHORTEST WAY WOULD BE TO HASTEN TO THE INN ON FOOT HE OBJECTED BUT HIS JAWS WERE CHATTERING HIS LIMBS WERE QUAKING SO THEY SEIZED HIM BETWEEN THEM AND MADE OFF BUT NEVER BARGAINED FOR THE MEETING OF MISTER CARLYLE AND HIS PARTY
IT WAS MY DUTY TO DO SO THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO UNDERTAKE IT DID YOU ASCERTAIN POSITIVELY BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT SHE DID DIE
MISTER CARLYLE'S LIP CURLED HE CONTINUED HIS WAY AND DREW THE PEER WITH HIM WHAT THE DEUCE IS A GATE NOW CALLED OUT THE FOLLOWERS OF MISTER CARLYLE THAT'S LEVISON HAS HE BEEN IN A RAILWAY SMASH AND GOT DRENCHED BY THE ENGINE
MA'AM REPEATED JOYCE IN SOME SURPRISE AS IT APPEARED THE GOVERNESS DO YOU MEAN MADAME VINE DO I MEAN YOU OR DO I MEAN ME ARE WE GOVERNESSES IRASCIBLY CRIED MISS CORNY WHO SHOULD I MEAN BUT MADAME VINE
HIS FACE TURNED WHITE AND HE TREMBLED IN HIS SHOES WORTHLESS MEN ARE FREQUENTLY COWARDS LADY ISABEL TREMBLED IN HERS AND WELL SHE MIGHT HEARING THAT ONE ALLUSION THEY SET UPON HIM TWENTY PAIRS OF HANDS AT LEAST STRONG ROUGH DETERMINED HANDS
NICCOLO MACCHIAVELLI THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AND THE FUTURE DUCHESS OF FERRARA WAS ADMIRABLY RECEIVED IN EVERY TOWN ALONG HER ROUTE
IN A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS DISCUSSING THE CONDITIONS OF CAPITULATION WITH THE FRENCH CAPTAINS SUDDENLY GREAT CRIES OF DISTRESS WERE HEARD THESE WERE CAUSED BY BORGIA WHO WITHOUT A WORD TO ANYONE HAD ENTERED THE TOWN WITH HIS FAITHFUL ARMY FROM ROMAGNA
THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS WAS INVITED TO RETURN TO ROME TO TAKE HIS SHARE IN THE FAMILY REJOICING AND ON THE DAY WHEN THE NEWS WAS MADE PUBLIC THE GOVERNOR OF SAINT ANGELO RECEIVED ORDERS THAT CANNON SHOULD BE FIRED EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR FROM NOON TO MIDNIGHT
HAVING PASSED THE VOLTURNO APPROACHED TO LAY SIEGE TO CAPUA
FOOD WAS PLENTY AND EVERYBODY WAS ON THE BEST OF TERMS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE MISTER MOLE LIVED JUST AS THE REST DID HE WENT AND CAME AS HE PLEASED AND ENJOYED THE SUNSHINE AND TOOK PART IN ALL THE GOOD TIMES OF HIS NEIGHBORS
ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT ROME THE FRENCH AND SPANISH AMBASSADORS PRESENTED TO THE POPE THE TREATY SIGNED AT GRENADA
AND IT WAS ONLY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT CALONNA
FAVOUR WITH HIS HOLINESS SO WHEN SHE RETURNED TO ROME SHE NO LONGER HAD SEPARATE ROOMS FROM HIM THE RESULT OF THIS RECRUDESCENCE OF AFFECTION WAS THE APPEARANCE OF TWO PONTIFICAL BULLS
EATEN ME IF I HADN'T CRAWLED INTO AN OLD HOLLOW STUMP NOW I CAN'T RUN FAST BECAUSE MY LEGS ARE TOO SHORT I CAN'T CLIMB TREES LIKE MISTER SQUIRREL AND I CAN'T SWIM LIKE MISTER MUSKRAT THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS TO DIG
THEY ALSO STARTED FOR THE SMILING POOL GRANDFATHER FROG WAS SITTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY PAD IN THE WARM SUNSHINE AND FOR ONCE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE TEASED FOR A STORY CHUG A RUM SAID HE IN HIS DEEP VOICE
THAT SIX FLORENTINE CITIZENS TO BE CHOSEN BY VITELLOZZO SHOULD BE PUT INTO HIS HANDS THAT THEY MIGHT BY THEIR DEATH EXPIATE THAT OF PAOLO VITELLI UNJUSTLY EXECUTED BY THE FLORENTINES THAT THE SIGNORIA SHOULD ENGAGE TO GIVE NO AID TO THE LORD OF PIOMBINO
ONLY TO RECEIVE INTO HIS FORTRESSES CONQUERORS AND MASTERS INSTEAD OF ALLIES ALL THIS PERHAPS WAS NOT VERY LOYAL CONDUCT ON THE PART OF A KING WHO HAD SO LONG DESIRED AND HAD JUST NOW RECEIVED THE SURNAME OF CATHOLIC BUT IT MATTERED LITTLE TO LOUIS
EVERYBODY LIKED HIM AND WHENEVER HE MADE A CALL HE WAS SURE OF A WELCOME BUT ONE THING MISTER MOLE NEVER DID HE NEVER MEDDLED IN OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS NO SIR
SON OF DUKE HERCULES OF FERRARA IN FAVOUR OF WHICH ALLIANCE
WAS THAT IT WAS IMPROBABLE THAT THE SAME DEMONSTRATIONS OF JOY COULD BE EXPECTED FROM A TOWN PLUNGED IN MOURNING THAT WERE LOOKED FOR FROM IMALA FAENZA AND PESARO
WHILE THE ENVOYS FROM FERRARA STOOD ON THE OTHER INTO THEIR MIDST CAME LUCREZIA AND DON FERDINAND PLACED ON HER FINGER THE NUPTIAL RING THIS CEREMONY OVER
AND IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES OF NEED BUT HURRIED AS HE WAS CAESAR STILL HOPED THAT HE MIGHT FIND TIME TO CONQUER THE TERRITORY OF PIOMBINO AS HE WENT BY AND TAKE THE CAPITAL BY A SINGLE VIGOROUS STROKE
THE CEREMONY OF BETROTHAL OVER THE POPE AND THE DUKE BUSIED THEMSELVES WITH MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THE DEPARTURE THE POPE WHO WISHED THE JOURNEY TO BE MADE WITH A GREAT DEGREE OF SPLENDOUR
LEAVING THE DUKE OF VALENTINOIS TO DO THE HONOURS OF THE VATICAN TO THE MEN THAT EVENING THE GUESTS MET AGAIN AND SPENT HALF THE NIGHT IN DANCING WHILE A MAGNIFICENT DISPLAY OF FIREWORKS LIGHTED UP THE PIAZZA OF SAN PAOLO
A DAUGHTER WAS BORN OF THIS MARRIAGE ANNE DE LAVAL WHO MARRIED FRANCOIS DE LA TRIMAUILLE THROUGH HER THOSE RIGHTS WERE TRANSMITTED TO THE HOUSE OF LA TRIMOUILLE
ISSUED FROM THE VATICAN FOLLOWED BY ALL THE NOBILITY OF ROME AND PROCEEDED TO THE CHURCH OF THE MADONNA DEL PAPALO WHERE THE DUKE OF GANDIA AND CARDINAL GIAN BORGIA WERE BURIED
THAT ON EVERY THIRD DAY THERE WOULD BE A BULL FIGHT IN THE SPANISH FASHION AND THAT FROM THE END OF THE PRESENT MONTH WHICH WAS OCTOBER UNTIL THE FIRST DAY OF LENT MASQUERADES WOULD BE PERMITTED IN THE STREETS OF ROME SUCH WAS THE NATURE OF THE FETES OUTSIDE
TO ASSASSINATE WITH HIS OWN HAND AGAMEMNON MARISCOTTI THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND ORDERED THE MASSACRE OF FOUR AND THIRTY OF HIS NEAR RELATIVES BROTHERS SONS DAUGHTERS AND NEPHEWS AND TWO HUNDRED OTHER OF HIS KINDRED AND FRIENDS
HE WENT OFF BY HIMSELF TO THINK THINGS OVER IT ISN'T SAFE TO RUN AROUND ANY MORE SAID HE I MET MISTER WOLF THIS MORNING AND HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SUCH A HUNGRY LOOK IN HIS EYES THAT IT GAVE ME THE COLD SHIVERS I BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE
WITH THE TITLE OF DUKE OF THESE PROVINCES BOTH WERE TO RECEIVE THE INVESTITURE FROM THE POPE AND TO HOLD THEM OF HIM THIS PARTITION WAS ALL THE MORE LIKELY TO BE MADE IN FACT BECAUSE FREDERIC SUPPOSING ALL THE TIME THAT FERDINAND WAS HIS GOOD AND FAITHFUL FRIEND WOULD OPEN THE GATES OF HIS TOWNS
AND ORDERED THEM TO DANCE THEIR NATIONAL DANCES BEFORE HIM FOLLOWING ON THESE DANCES CAME FEASTS OF UNHEARD OF MAGNIFICENCE DURING WHICH THE POPE IN THE SIGHT OF ALL MEN COMPLETELY IGNORED LENT AND DID NOT FAST
HIS HOLINESS WAS NOW HAVING A RUN OF GOOD FORTUNE AND HE LEARNED ON THE SAME DAY THAT PIOMBINO WAS TAKEN AND THAT DUKE HERCULES HAD GIVEN THE KING OF FRANCE HIS ASSENT TO THE MARRIAGE BOTH OF THESE PIECES OF NEWS WERE GOOD FOR ALEXANDER
MISTER MOLE WAS AT THE END OF A LONG TUNNEL SO FAR FROM THE HOLE HE HAD FIRST DUG THAT HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM A LONG TIME TO DIG HIM OUT EVEN IF THEY NOTICED HIS TUNNEL BUT THEY DIDN'T THEY DUG DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF HIS HOLE AND THEN
BEFORE EXCITED BY THE MARISCOTTI OLD ENEMIES OF THE BENTIVOGLIO FAMILY
BUT GIAN DI BENTIVOGLIO WHOSE ANCESTORS HAD POSSESSED THIS TOWN FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAD NOT ONLY MADE ALL PREPARATIONS NECESSARY FOR A LONG RESISTANCE BUT HE HAD ALSO PUT HIMSELF UNDER THE PROTECTION OF FRANCE
AND THEN IT WAS THAT FEAR WAS BORN THE BIG PEOPLE LIKE OLD KING BEAR AND MISTER WOLF AND MISTER PANTHER AND MISTER LYNX BEGAN TO LOOK WITH HUNGRY EYES ON THE LITTLE PEOPLE
WHICH HE WAS AT LAST IN A POSITION TO UNDERTAKE CAESAR DARED NOT BREAK HIS WORD TO SO POWERFUL AN ALLY HE THEREFORE REPLIED THAT HE WAS AT THE KING'S ORDERS AND AS THE FLORENTINES WERE NOT AWARE THAT HE WAS QUITTING THEM ON COMPULSION
TO SUM UP THE CASE BUT THE JUDGE SAID HE NEVER HAD SUMMED UP BEFORE SO THE SNARK UNDERTOOK IT INSTEAD AND SUMMED IT SO WELL THAT IT CAME TO FAR MORE THAN THE WITNESSES EVER HAD SAID
HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS CALLED HIM CANDLE ENDS AND HIS ENEMIES TOASTED CHEESE HIS FORM IS UNGAINLY HIS INTELLECT SMALL SO THE BELLMAN WOULD OFTEN REMARK
BUT MUCH YET REMAINS TO BE SAID IN ONE MOMENT I'VE SEEN WHAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN ENVELOPED IN ABSOLUTE MYSTERY AND WITHOUT EXTRA CHARGE I WILL GIVE YOU AT LARGE A LESSON IN NATURAL HISTORY
IF ONLY I'VE STATED IT THRICE THE BEAVER HAD COUNTED WITH SCRUPULOUS CARE ATTENDING TO EVERY WORD BUT IT FAIRLY LOST HEART AND OUTGRABE IN DESPAIR WHEN THE THIRD REPETITION OCCURRED
WHAT I TELL YOU THREE TIMES IS TRUE THE CREW WAS COMPLETE IT INCLUDED A BOOTS A MAKER OF BONNETS AND HOODS A BARRISTER BROUGHT TO ARRANGE THEIR DISPUTES AND A BROKER TO VALUE THEIR GOODS
THE LOSS OF HIS CLOTHES HARDLY MATTERED BECAUSE HE HAD SEVEN COATS ON WHEN HE CAME WITH THREE PAIRS OF BOOTS BUT THE WORST OF IT WAS HE HAD WHOLLY FORGOTTEN HIS NAME HE WOULD ANSWER TO HI
AND SOME OF THEM FAINTED AWAY THEN THE SNARK PRONOUNCED SENTENCE THE JUDGE BEING QUITE TOO NERVOUS TO UTTER A WORD WHEN IT ROSE TO ITS FEET THERE WAS SILENCE LIKE NIGHT
THAT OPPRESSES MY SOUL WHEN I THINK OF MY UNCLE'S LAST WORDS AND MY HEART IS LIKE NOTHING SO MUCH AS A BOWL BRIMMING OVER WITH QUIVERING CURDS IT IS THIS IT IS THIS
IT'S EXCESSIVELY AWKWARD TO MENTION IT NOW WITH THE SNARK SO TO SPEAK AT THE DOOR WE SHOULD ALL OF US GRIEVE AS YOU WELL MAY BELIEVE IF YOU NEVER WERE MET WITH AGAIN BUT SURELY MY MAN
THEY MARCHED ALONG SHOULDER TO SHOULDER THEN A SCREAM SHRILL AND HIGH RENT THE SHUDDERING SKY AND THEY KNEW THAT SOME DANGER WAS NEAR THE BEAVER TURNED PALE TO THE TIP OF ITS TAIL
I INFORMED YOU THE DAY WE EMBARKED YOU MAY CHARGE ME WITH MURDER OR WANT OF SENSE WE ARE ALL OF US WEAK AT TIMES BUT THE SLIGHTEST
IN A DREAMY DELIRIOUS FIGHT I SERVE IT WITH GREENS IN THOSE SHADOWY SCENES AND I USE IT FOR STRIKING A LIGHT
THEY SOUGHT IT WITH THIMBLES THEY SOUGHT IT WITH CARE THEY PURSUED IT WITH FORKS AND HOPE THEY THREATENED ITS LIFE WITH A RAILWAY SHARE THEY CHARMED IT
THE FIVE UNMISTAKABLE MARKS BY WHICH YOU MAY KNOW WHERESOEVER YOU GO THE WARRANTED GENUINE SNARKS LET US TAKE THEM IN ORDER THE FIRST IS THE TASTE WHICH IS MEAGRE
NO MATERIALS WERE TO BE HAD THE LAST OF THE CREW NEEDS ESPECIAL REMARK THOUGH HE LOOKED AN INCREDIBLE DUNCE HE HAD JUST ONE IDEA BUT THAT ONE BEING SNARK
AND THEN MULTIPLY OUT BY ONE THOUSAND DIMINISHED BY EIGHT THE RESULT WE PROCEED TO DIVIDE AS YOU SEE
EACH THOUGHT HE WAS THINKING OF NOTHING BUT SNARK AND THE GLORIOUS WORK OF THE DAY AND EACH TRIED TO PRETEND THAT HE DID NOT REMARK THAT THE OTHER WAS GOING THAT WAY
YOU COULD NEVER MEET EITHER ALONE AND WHEN QUARRELS AROSE AS ONE FREQUENTLY FINDS QUARRELS WILL SPITE OF EVERY ENDEAVOUR THE SONG OF THE JUBJUB RECURRED TO THEIR MINDS
AND HOLLOW BUT CRISP LIKE A COAT THAT IS RATHER TOO TIGHT IN THE WAIST WITH A FLAVOUR OF WILL O' THE WISP ITS HABIT OF GETTING UP LATE YOU'LL AGREE THAT IT CARRIES TOO FAR WHEN I SAY
ON THE CHARGE OF DESERTING ITS STY THE WITNESSES PROVED WITHOUT ERROR OR FLAW THAT THE STY WAS DESERTED WHEN FOUND AND THE JUDGE KEPT EXPLAINING THE STATE OF THE LAW IN A SOFT
IF WE HAPPEN TO MEET IT TOGETHER AND THE BELLMAN SAGACIOUSLY NODDING HIS HEAD SAID THAT MUST DEPEND ON THE WEATHER THE BEAVER WENT SIMPLY GALUMPHING ABOUT AT SEEING THE BUTCHER SO SHY
THEN SUBTRACT SEVENTEEN AND THE ANSWER MUST BE EXACTLY AND PERFECTLY TRUE THE METHOD EMPLOYED I WOULD GLADLY EXPLAIN WHILE I HAVE IT SO CLEAR IN MY HEAD IF I HAD BUT THE TIME AND YOU HAD BUT THE BRAIN
AND THE CREW WERE MUCH PLEASED WHEN THEY FOUND IT TO BE A MAP THEY COULD ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE GOOD OF MERCATOR'S NORTH POLES AND EQUATORS TROPICS ZONES AND MERIDIAN LINES
EASE AND SUCH GRACE SUCH SOLEMNITY TOO ONE COULD SEE HE WAS WISE THE MOMENT ONE LOOKED IN HIS FACE HE HAD BOUGHT A LARGE MAP REPRESENTING THE SEA WITHOUT THE LEAST VESTIGE OF LAND
NOW OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND SPEAK IF YOUR THOUGHTS INCLINE EVER SO LITTLE TOWARDS FUMING YOU WILL SAY FUMING FURIOUS IF THEY TURN BY EVEN A HAIR'S BREADTH TOWARDS FURIOUS YOU WILL SAY FURIOUS FUMING BUT
A PERFECTLY BALANCED MIND YOU WILL SAY FRUMIOUS SUPPOSING THAT WHEN PISTOL UTTERED THE WELL KNOWN WORDS UNDER WHICH KING BEZONIAN SPEAK OR DIE
THOUGH THE BARRISTER TRIED TO APPEAL TO ITS PRIDE AND VAINLY PROCEEDED TO CITE A NUMBER OF CASES IN WHICH MAKING LACES
THERE WAS THE CRITICISM IN THE PRESS AND ON THE LIPS OF MEN THAT WE WERE EMBARRASSING OUR GOVERNMENT BEFORE THE EYES OF FOREIGN VISITORS IN ANSWERING THE CRITICISM MISS PAUL PUBLICLY STATED OUR POSITION THUS
AND THE FOLLOWING DAY A DELEGATION LEFT FOR WASHINGTON I CITE THIS EXPERIENCE OF MINE BECAUSE IT WAS TYPICAL EVERY ONE WHO WENT THROUGH THE COUNTRY TELLING THE STORY HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AT THIS TIME INDIGNATION WAS SWIFT AND HOT
IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE TO US IN THAT IT MADE OUR ATTACK MORE DRAMATIC ONE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPECCABLE WAS MORE VULNERABLE IT WAS A DISADVANTAGE TO HAVE TO OVERCOME THIS UNIVERSAL TRUST AND WORLD WIDE POPULARITY
SOME RUMBLINGS OF POLITICAL ACTION BEGAN TO BE HEARD THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY HAD APPOINTED A SENATE COMMITTEE ON WOMAN SUFFRAGE WHOSE MEMBERS WERE OVERWHELMINGLY FOR FEDERAL ACTION THE CHAIRMAN SENATOR ANDREAS JONES OF NEW MEXICO
THE OFFICIAL BULLETIN CONCLUDES WITH IT IS A FACT THAT THERE REMAINS IN AMERICA ONE MAN WHO HAS KNOWN EXACTLY THE RIGHT ATTITUDE TO TAKE AND MAINTAIN TOWARD THE PICKETS
PROMISED AN EARLY REPORT TO THE SENATE THERE WERE SCORES OF GAINS IN CONGRESS REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS WERE TUMBLING OVER EACH OTHER TO INTRODUCE SIMILAR SUFFRAGE RESOLUTIONS WE ACTUALLY HAD DIFFICULTY IN CHOOSING THE MAN WHOSE NAME SHOULD STAMP OUR MEASURE
THE FOLLOWING DAY MISS LUCY BURNS AND MISS KATHERINE MOREY OF BOSTON CARRIED TO THE WHITE HOUSE GATES WE SHALL FIGHT FOR THE THINGS WE HAVE ALWAYS HELD NEAREST OUR HEARTS FOR DEMOCRACY FOR THE RIGHT OF THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY
BECAUSE WOMEN WERE HOLDING BANNERS ASKING FOR THE PRECIOUS PRINCIPLE AT HOME THAT MEN WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DYING FOR ABROAD FINALLY A DECISION WAS REACHED EMBODYING THE COMBINED WISDOM OF ALL THE VARIOUS CONFEREES
EVIDENTLY AROUSED PROTESTS FROM POWERFUL QUARTERS ALSO THE REPUBLICANS QUICKLY SUBSIDED WHEN THEY SAW THE DEMOCRATS MAKING AN ADVANCE AND SO THE DEMOCRATIC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE BEGAN TO SPREAD ABROAD THE NEWS THAT ITS ACT WAS NOT REALLY OFFICIAL
HAD NOTHING TO DO IT WAS CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE EFFORT TO OBTAIN FOR WOMEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE EFFECTIVE EXPRESSION THROUGH POLITICAL POWER TO THEIR IDEALS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT BE
THAT WE WERE ADVANCING TO THAT POSITION WHERE WE WERE AS GOOD POLITICAL MATERIAL TO BE CONTESTED OVER BY OPPOSING POLITICAL GROUPS AS WAS A MONUMENT TO A DEAD PRESIDENT AND IF THE DEMOCRATS COULD DEFEND SUCH AN ISSUE AS A WAR MEASURE
AND DID NOT RELISH HAVING OUR QUESTION SO VIVID IN THE PUBLIC MIND
THE ADMINISTRATION HAD LITTLE CHOICE IT MUST YIELD TO THIS PRESSURE FROM THE PEOPLE OR IT MUST SUPPRESS THE AGITATION WHICH WAS CAUSING SUCH INTEREST IT MUST PASS THE AMENDMENT OR REMOVE THE TROUBLESOME PICKETS IT DECIDED TO REMOVE THE PICKETS
WE WERE FACE TO FACE WITH THE QUESTION WHICH WE HAD CONSIDERED AT THE CONVENTION THE PREVIOUS MONTH WHEN WAR WAS RUMORED AS TO WHAT POSITION WE AS AN ORGANIZATION SHOULD TAKE IN THIS SITUATION THE ATMOSPHERE OF THAT CONVENTION HAD BEEN DRAMATIC IN THE EXTREME
THEY APPOINTED A COMMITTEE FROM THE CONVENTION TO CARRY THESE RESOLUTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT THE COMMITTEE INCLUDED MISTER J A H HOPKINS OF THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY AS CHAIRMAN
JUST AS THE BLUFF OF A DEMOCRATIC CRUSADE MUST BE CALLED SO MUST THE KNIGHT LEADER OF THE CRUSADE BE EXPOSED TO THE CRITICAL EYES OF THE WORLD
MOST OF THE DELEGATES ASSEMBLED HAD BEEN APPROACHED EITHER BEFORE GOING TO WASHINGTON OR UPON ARRIVING AND URGED TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO PERSUADE THE ORGANIZATION TO ABANDON ITS WORK FOR THE FREEDOM OF WOMEN AND TURN ITS ACTIVITIES INTO WAR CHANNELS
AT THE SAME TIME HIS NOW GIGANTIC FIGURE STOOD OBSTINATELY ACROSS THE PATH TO OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE IT WAS OUR DAILY TASK TO KEEP VIVIDLY IN HIS MIND THAT OBJECTIVE IT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPEL DECISIVE ACTION FROM HIM
BAYONETS MACHINE GUNS POISON GAS DEADLY GRENADES LIQUID FIRE BOMBS ARMORED TANKS PISTOLS BARBED WIRE ENTANGLEMENTS SUBMARINES MINES EVERY KNOWN SCIENTIFIC DEVICE WITH WHICH TO ANNIHILATE THE ENEMY
AND POINTED OUT THE DIFFICULTY OF WAGING A WAR FOR DEMOCRACY ABROAD WHILE DEMOCRACY WAS DENIED AT HOME BUT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT WILLING TO PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF ITS ALLIES IN EXTENDING SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN WITHOUT FIRST OFFERING A TERRIBLE AND BRUTAL RESISTANCE
HOPING TO WIN BACK TO THE FOLD THE WANDERING PROGRESSIVES WHO HAD THUS DEMONSTRATED THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO SUFFRAGE AND SEEING AN OPPORTUNITY TO EMBARRASS THE ADMINISTRATION THE REPUBLICANS BEGAN TO INTEREST THEMSELVES IN ACTION ON THE AMENDMENT
AND REPORTERS NOT TO ENCOURAGE US IN OUR PECULIAR CONDUCT BY PRINTING DEFIES TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EVEN WHEN FLAUNTED ON A PRETTY LITTLE PURPLE AND GOLD BANNER AND EXHORTS THE PUBLIC TO CONTROL ITS THRILLS
COMPARE THE METHODS WOMEN ADOPTED TO THOSE MEN USE IN THE PURSUIT OF DEMOCRACY
AND STILL NO ATTEMPT BY THE POLICE TO QUELL THE RIOT THE CLIMAX CAME WHEN IN THE LATE AFTERNOON A BULLET WAS FIRED THROUGH ONE OF THE HEAVY GLASS WINDOWS OF THE SECOND FLOOR EMBEDDING ITSELF IN THE CEILING THE BULLET GRAZED PAST THE HEAD OF MISSUS ELLA MORTON DEAN OF MONTANA
THIS OCCASION OFFERED US THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO EXPOSE THE ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS IN CLAIMING COMPLETE POLITICAL DEMOCRACY WHILE WOMEN WERE STILL DENIED THEIR POLITICAL FREEDOM
THE THOUSAND DELEGATES PRESENT AT THE CONVENTION THOUGH DIFFERING WIDELY ON THE DUTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN WAR WERE UNANIMOUS IN VOTING THAT IN THE EVENT OF WAR THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S PARTY AS AN ORGANIZATION SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK FOR POLITICAL LIBERTY FOR WOMEN AND FOR THAT ALONE
THE CHIEF OF POLICE MAJOR PULLMAN WAS DETAILED TO REQUEST US TO STOP PICKETING AND TO TELL US THAT IF WE CONTINUED TO PICKET WE WOULD BE ARRESTED WE HAVE PICKETED FOR SIX MONTHS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE SAID MISS PAUL HAS THE LAW BEEN CHANGED
AS ONE PRISONER CONFIDED TO MISS JOY YOUNG IT DEVELOPED THAT ORDERS HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT THE JAIL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ARRESTS AND BEFORE THE TRIAL TO MAKE READY FOR THE SUFFRAGETTES WHAT DID IT MATTER THAT THEIR CASE HAD NOT YET BEEN HEARD
THIS ENTIRE SPECTACLE WAS ENACTED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH WITHIN A STONE'S THROW OF THE WHITE HOUSE MISS PAUL SUMMED UP THE SITUATION WHEN SHE SAID THE SITUATION NOW EXISTING IN WASHINGTON EXISTS BECAUSE PRESIDENT WILSON PERMITS IT
SO WHEN WE CAME TO THE FORKS OF THE ROAD I FOLLOWED THE BEST BEATEN TRACK AND WAS SOON TRAVELING ALONG ON THE LEVEL HARD BUT NARROW WAY THE TOWPATH ALL WENT WELL THAT DAY
THERE WAS A FAINT SCRAPING SOUND FOLLOWED BY A CLICK THE DARKNESS OF THE ROOM WAS RELIEVED BY MOONLIGHT THE FIGURES PASSED THROUGH
THE FUN OF IT WAS THAT THE GUN THAT HAD SPREAD SUCH CONSTERNATION HADN'T BEEN LOADED FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS
CONSIDERING THAT NO ONE WAS LIKELY TO TEST THE LEGALITY OF THE ORDINANCE HE THOUGHT I WOULD BE SAFE IN ACTING AS THOUGH IT WERE LEGAL JUST THIRTY DAYS FROM THE TIME I HAD THE BOTHER WITH THE POLICEMEN AND HAVING INCURRED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS OF EXTRA EXPENSE
IT IS NOW DISTRIBUTED OVER THE NEIGHBOURING SOIL THUS REMOVING A POWERFUL TEMPTATION FROM YOUR PATH YOU'RE BETTER WITHOUT IT HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH WELL IT OUGHT TO BE ALL RIGHT NOW HE WENT TO THE WINDOW THERE'S AN AUTOMOBILE DOWN THERE I SUPPOSE IT'S JERRY
THE FELLOW WAS BRAZEN ENOUGH ALSO TO DEMAND PAY FOR KEEPING HIM THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN I GOT UP AND TALKED POINTEDLY BUT I HAD MY FAITHFUL DOG BACK AND I KEPT HIM MORE CLOSELY BY ME WHILE I WAS MAKING THE REST OF MY TOUR
AFTER HIS FATHER AND OGDEN HAD PASSED THROUGH AND HE PROPOSED TO REMAIN HID IN THE GALLERY THERE UNTIL THE TIME CAME FOR HIM TO DO THIS IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT HE AVOID BEING SEEN BY OGDEN LOCKING HIS DOOR BEHIND HIM HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS
DO YOU WANT TO MURDER ME WHY NOT MISTER CROCKER'S MAKE UP WAS TRICKLING DOWN HIS FACE IN STICKY STREAMS THE MASK HOWEVER PREVENTED OGDEN FROM SEEING THIS PECULIAR PHENOMENON HE WAS GAZING INTERESTEDLY AT HIS VISITOR
THE ONLY TROUBLE IS JIM HE SAID PEERING AT HIMSELF IN THE GLASS SHAN'T I SCARE THE BOY TO DEATH DIRECTLY HE SEES ME
HAD BEEN THE DAILY INTERVIEWS WITH THE DETECTIVES SHE ACHED TO TELEPHONE FOR ONE NOW THE ONLY CONSIDERATION THAT KEPT HER BACK WAS A REGARD FOR LORD WISBEACH'S FEELINGS HE HAD BEEN SO KIND AND SO SHREWD THAT TO SUGGEST REINFORCING HIM WITH OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE
THE MAYOR WAS ABSENT AND THE ACTING MAYOR COULD NOT SIGN AN ORDINANCE UNTIL AFTER TEN DAYS HAD ELAPSED THE CITY ATTORNEY CAME IN AND SAID THE ALDERMEN HAD EXCEEDED THEIR AUTHORITY AS THEY COULD NOT LEGALLY GRANT A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE
FAINT SNORES PROCEEDED FROM THE BASKET IN THE CORNER WHERE AIDA THE POMERANIAN LAY CURLED IN REFRESHING SLEEP THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW FLOATED SOUNDS OF WARMTH AND SUMMER YIELDING TO THE DROWSY CALM
BUT I THOUGHT IT WELL TO MAKE A CAMPAIGN OF EDUCATION TO GET THE WORK BEFORE THE GENERAL PUBLIC SO THAT CONGRESS MIGHT KNOW ABOUT IT THEREFORE A ROUTE WAS LAID OUT TO OCCUPY THE TIME UNTIL THE FIRST OF DECEMBER JUST BEFORE CONGRESS WOULD AGAIN ASSEMBLE
NAW A NEW GUY OH SAY I DON'T REMEMBER YOU IF IT COMES TO THAT YOU DON'T SAID MISTER CROCKER A LITTLE DISCOMPOSED WELL MAYBE I WOULDN'T WITH THAT MASK ON YOU WHICH OF THEM ARE YOU CHICAGO ED S MY MONAKER
BUT WHY DID YOU I TOLD YOU THAT I PRETENDED TO ACCEPT THIS MAN AS THE REAL JIMMY CROCKER FOR A PURPOSE AT PRESENT THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO MERE IMPERSONATION IS NOT A CRIME IF I HAD EXPOSED HIM WHEN WE MET
BUT IT WILL BE TWO WEEKS BEFORE YOU GO TO THE COUNTRY AND IN THOSE TWO WEEKS YOU MUST COME HERE AT ONCE LORD WISBEACH TO NIGHT
HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED WATCHING HIS FATHER PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO HIS MAKE UP WHICH WAS OF A SHAGGY AND INTIMIDATING NATURE THE ELDER CROCKER HAD CONCEIVED THE OUTWARD ASPECT OF CHICAGO ED KING OF THE KIDNAPPERS
SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF THE DETECTIVE AGENCY WHICH SHE HAD EMPLOYED ON THE OCCASION OF THE KIDNAPPING OF OGDEN BUT SHE REMEMBERED THE NAME
AMOUNTED TO THE REALISATION THAT THE BEST MODE OF DEFENCE IS ATTACK IT IS YOUR MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THE BOLD GAME ON OCCASION WHO WINS A DULLER SCHEMER THAN LORD WISBEACH MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO BE INACTIVE AFTER SUCH A CONVERSATION
I'M STRONG FOR BUCK HE SAID CONVERSATIONALLY WE'RE OLD PALS DID YOU SEE THE PIECE IN THE PAPER ABOUT HIM KIDNAPPING ME LAST TIME I'VE GOT IT IN MY PRESS CLIPPING ALBUM SURE SAID MISTER CROCKER SAY LISTEN IF YOU TAKE ME NOW BUCK'S GOT TO COME ACROSS
AS TO LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ADEQUATE TO DEAL WITH THE MATTER SINGLE HANDED BUT ADMIRABLE THOUGH HE WAS HE WAS NOT A PROFESSIONAL EXPONENT OF THE ART OF ESPIONAGE HE NEEDED TO BE HELPED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
AND A FIRM FRIENDSHIP SEEMS TO HAVE SPRUNG UP BETWEEN THEM THERE'S NOTHING LIKE COMING WITH A GOOD INTRODUCTION MISTER CROCKER TOOK A FINAL SURVEY OF HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR GEE I I'D HATE TO MEET MYSELF ON A LONELY ROAD HE OPENED THE DOOR AND STOOD FOR A MOMENT LISTENING
MISSUS PETT ON LEAVING THE LUNCHEON TABLE HAD RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM TO SIT BESIDE THE SICK SETTEE OF HER STRICKEN CHILD SHE WAS TROUBLED ABOUT OGDEN THE POOR LAMB WAS NOT AT ALL HIMSELF TO DAY A BOWL OF CLEAR SOUP
DAT'S RIGHT BUCK'LL SLIP YOUSE HALF OF ANYT'ING HE GETS ALL RIGHT THEN WAIT TILL I'VE GOT THIS SHOE ON AND LET'S START NOW I'M READY BEAT IT QUIETLY WHAT DID YOU THINK I WAS GOING TO DO SING
WITH SURPRISING DOCILITY THE BOY ROSE ALL RIGHT HE SAID POOR OGGIE IS NOT AT ALL WELL TO DAY SAID MISSUS PETT WHEN HE WAS GONE HE IS VERY SUBJECT TO THESE ATTACKS
ROLLING HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL HE CAME OUT AS DIZZY AS A DRUNKEN MAN I THOUGHT HE WAS A GONER THAT TIME FOR SURE BUT HE SOON STRAIGHTENED UP FINALLY IN THE STREETS OF KANSAS CITY HE WAS RUN OVER BY A HEAVY TRUCK WHILE FIGHTING WITH ANOTHER DOG
MISSUS PETT WAS JUST NODDING INTO A PLEASANT NAP WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND LORD WISBEACH CAME IN LORD WISBEACH HAD BEEN DOING SOME RAPID THINKING RAPID THOUGHT IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIALS IN THE COMPOSITION OF MEN WHO ARE KNOWN AS GENTLEMAN JACK TO THE BOYS
HE FORGOT TO MIX IN OATHS AND SLUNK OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND THE WAGON THE OTHERS ALSO DREW BACK JIM SHOWED HIS TEETH AND A TRUCE FOLLOWED WITH BUT LITTLE INCONVENIENCE THE MULES WERE TAKEN OFF THE PATH AND THE OX TEAM WAS DRIVEN PAST
YOU REMEMBER WE MET SOME YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS MISSUS FORD YES THE MOTHER OF OGDEN FORD I WANT TO CONSULT
SHE SAT WITH HER BABY AT HER THIN WHITE BREAST THE CRIME SHE HAD COMMITTED WAS THAT WHEN A RECRUIT WAS ACCORDING TO THE PEASANTS VIEW UNLAWFULLY TAKEN FROM THEIR VILLAGE
OMITTED TO INFORM THE JURY WHAT THE JUDICIAL POINTS ARE THAT CONSTITUTE GUILT AND DID NOT MENTION THAT HAVING ADMITTED THE FACT OF MASLOVA HAVING ADMINISTERED THE POISON TO SMELKOFF THE JURY HAD A RIGHT NOT TO IMPUTE THE GUILT OF MURDER TO HER
FANARIN SAID LAUGHING BUT ALL THE SAME IT WILL DO AS A REASON FOR APPEAL THIRDLY THE PRESIDENT IN HIS SUMMING UP
ON WHICH LAY ILLUSTRATED PAPERS MEANT TO AMUSE THEM AWAITING THEIR TURNS TO BE ADMITTED TO THE ADVOCATE THE ADVOCATE'S ASSISTANT SAT IN THE ROOM AT A HIGH DESK AND HAVING RECOGNISED NEKHLUDOFF HE CAME UP TO HIM
AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE COURT SHE TURNED TO THE USHER WITH THE QUESTION WHETHER SHE MIGHT GIVE MASLOVA A LITTLE MONEY THE USHER SAID SHE MIGHT HAVING GOT PERMISSION SHE REMOVED THE THREE BUTTONED SWEDISH KID GLOVE FROM HER PLUMP WHITE HAND
SOKOLOFF TAKE HER IN SHOUTED THE ASSISTANT INSPECTOR THE CHIEF WARDER CAME UP
HE SAID YOU SAW THIS HERE FELLOW WHY HE HAS ABOUT TWELVE MILLION ROUBLES AND HE CANNOT SPEAK CORRECTLY AND IF HE CAN GET A TWENTY FIVE ROUBLE NOTE OUT OF YOU HE'LL HAVE IT IF HE'S TO WRENCH IT OUT WITH HIS TEETH
ALL QUITE USELESS THEIR ONLY USE NEKHLUDOFF THOUGHT WAS THE PROVIDING OF EXERCISE FOR AGRAPHENA PETROVNA CORNEY THE GATE KEEPER THE BOY AND THE COOK
THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO SPEAK SHE HAS RETURNED FROM THE LAW COURTS SIR SAID ONE OF THE SOLDIERS COMING FORWARD WITH HIS FINGERS LIFTED TO HIS CAP WELL HAND HER OVER TO THE CHIEF WARDER I WON'T HAVE THIS SORT OF THING YES SIR
THIS WOMAN STOOD SILENT BUT KEPT SMILING WITH PLEASURE AND APPROVAL AT WHAT WAS GOING ON BELOW WITH THESE STOOD A PEASANT WOMAN OF MEDIUM HEIGHT THE MOTHER OF THE BOY WHO WAS PLAYING WITH THE OLD WOMAN AND OF A SEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL
BUSINESS LIKE FACES OF JUDGES AND JURY WHO HEARD THIS NEWS AS IF IT WERE PERFECTLY NATURAL AND EXPECTED SHE GREW INDIGNANT AND PROCLAIMED LOUDLY TO THE WHOLE COURT THAT SHE WAS NOT GUILTY
BUT IT'S NOT WORTH WHILE ALTERING MY MANNER OF LIFE NOW HE THOUGHT WHILE MASLOVA'S CASE IS NOT DECIDED BESIDES IT IS TOO DIFFICULT IT WILL ALTER OF ITSELF WHEN SHE WILL BE SET FREE OR EXILED AND I FOLLOW HER
AND ANOTHER DEBATE ON THE QUESTION OF THE PRISONER'S GUILT THEN WHY DID THE PRESIDENT NOT DO IT I TOO SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY FANARIN SAID LAUGHING THEN THE SENATE WILL OF COURSE CORRECT THIS ERROR
SHE DID BRIGHTEN UP A LITTLE WHEN BOTCHKOVA AND KARTINKIN WERE LED AWAY AND AN ATTENDANT BROUGHT HER THREE ROUBLES ARE YOU MASLOVA HE ASKED
YES BUT WE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT OURSELVES IT WAS OUR MISTAKE AND NOW THE FOURTH POINT THE ADVOCATE CONTINUED THE FORM OF THE ANSWER GIVEN BY THE JURY CONTAINED AN EVIDENT CONTRADICTION
HER MOUTH WATERED AND SHE REALISED SHE WAS HUNGRY BUT CONSIDERED IT BENEATH HER DIGNITY TO BEG OF THEM THREE HOURS LATER THE DESIRE TO EAT HAD PASSED AND SHE FELT ONLY WEAK
AS HE RAN PAST THE OLD WOMAN HE KEPT REPEATING THERE HAVEN'T CAUGHT ME THIS OLD WOMAN AND HER SON WERE ACCUSED OF INCENDIARISM SHE BORE HER IMPRISONMENT WITH PERFECT CHEERFULNESS BUT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HER SON
BUT IT WAS THE PROSECUTING SIDE THAT DEMANDED THIS READING NEKHLUDOFF SAID WITH SURPRISE THAT DOES NOT MATTER THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN REASONS FOR THE DEFENCE TO DEMAND THIS READING TOO OH
PASSING MASLOVA ALL THE CONVICTS LOOKED AT HER AND SOME CAME UP TO HER AND BRUSHED HER AS THEY PASSED
COMING IN FROM BEHIND THE CONVICT SHRANK BACK AND JUMPED AWAY THE ASSISTANT ASSAILED MASLOVA WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR MASLOVA WAS GOING TO SAY SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK FROM THE LAW COURTS BUT SHE WAS SO TIRED
SHE WAS ATTIRED IN THE MOST ORIGINAL MANNER SHE SEEMED ENVELOPED IN SOMETHING MADE OF VELVET AND SILK SOMETHING YELLOW AND GREEN AND HER THIN HAIR WAS CRIMPED SHE STEPPED OUT TRIUMPHANTLY INTO THE ANTE ROOM
SHE WAS SERVING HER TERM OF IMPRISONMENT FOR ILLICIT SALE OF SPIRITS SHE STOOD A LITTLE FURTHER FROM THE WINDOW KNITTING A STOCKING AND THOUGH SHE LISTENED TO THE OTHER PRISONERS WORDS SHE SHOOK HER HEAD DISAPPROVINGLY FROWNED
SAID THE ADVOCATE SITTING DOWN OPPOSITE NEKHLUDOFF AND TRYING TO CONCEAL A SMILE APPARENTLY STILL EXCITED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE ACCOMPLISHED TRANSACTION THANKS I HAVE COME ABOUT MASLOVA'S CASE YES YES DIRECTLY
THAT HE AND NEKHLUDOFF BELONGED TO ONE AND THE SAME CAMP WHILE HIS OTHER CLIENTS BELONGED TO ANOTHER HE HAS WORRIED ME TO DEATH A FEARFUL SCOUNDREL I FELT I MUST RELIEVE MY FEELINGS SAID THE ADVOCATE
AND THE VOICE OF FANARIN HIMSELF FANARIN WAS ALSO A MIDDLE AGED MAN OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WITH A WORN LOOK ON HIS FACE BOTH FACES BORE THE EXPRESSION WHICH YOU SEE ON THE FACES OF THOSE WHO HAVE JUST CONCLUDED A PROFITABLE BUT NOT QUITE HONEST TRANSACTION
REFERRED TO THE CAUSES OF HER FALL HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE PRESIDENT CALLING HIM TO ORDER FOR THE ALLEGED DEVIATION FROM THE DIRECT SUBJECT YET AS HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY POINTED OUT BY THE SENATE THE ELUCIDATION OF THE CRIMINAL'S CHARACTERISTICS
SHE WAS CRUSHED BY THE UNEXPECTEDLY SEVERE SENTENCE AND TORMENTED BY HUNGER DURING THE FIRST INTERVAL OF HER TRIAL WHEN THE SOLDIERS WERE EATING BREAD AND HARD BOILED EGGS IN HER PRESENCE
MASLOVA IS ACCUSED OF WILFULLY POISONING SMELKOFF HER ONE OBJECT BEING THAT OF CUPIDITY THE ONLY MOTIVE TO COMMIT MURDER SHE COULD HAVE HAD THE JURY IN THEIR VERDICT ACQUIT HER OF THE INTENT TO ROB
LAY A PILE OF FINELY WRITTEN MANUSCRIPT AN OVERTURNED MARBLE PRESS TURNING GREEN AN ANCIENT BOOK IN A LEATHER COVER WITH RED EDGES A LEMON DRIED AND SHRUNKEN TO THE DIMENSIONS OF A HAZELNUT THE BROKEN ARM OF A CHAIR
AND THEN HANDED HIM THE MONEY PLUSHKIN TOOK IT IN BOTH HANDS BORE IT TO A BUREAU WITH AS MUCH CAUTION AS
WAS BETRAYED BY THE SPECTACLE OF AN OLD NIGHTCAP RESTING ON THE TABLE WHILST CHICHIKOV WAS GAZING AT THIS EXTRAORDINARY MESS A SIDE DOOR OPENED AND THERE ENTERED THE HOUSEKEEPER WHO HAD MET HIM NEAR THE OUTBUILDINGS
MAY CLUTCH THE ROPE WHICH HAS BEEN THROWN HIM MAY CLUTCH IT BEFORE THE SURFACE OF THE UNSTABLE ELEMENT SHALL HAVE RESUMED FOR EVER ITS CALM DREAD VACUITY BUT THE HOPE IS SHORT LIVED AND THE HANDS DISAPPEAR
BUT OF NO USE FOR LAYING A PLEA BEFORE A COURT
IN THE END THEREFORE I SHALL BE FORCED TO GO AND SPEND MY OLD AGE IN ROAMING ABOUT THE WORLD
AT ALL EVENTS FEELING'S PALE REFLECTION JUST SUCH A PHENOMENON MAY BE WITNESSED WHEN FOR A BRIEF MOMENT A DROWNING MAN MAKES A LAST RE APPEARANCE ON THE SURFACE OF A RIVER AND THERE RISES FROM THE CROWD LINING
NO THE MOST NOTICEABLE FEATURE ABOUT THE MAN WAS HIS CLOTHES IN NO WAY COULD IT HAVE BEEN GUESSED OF WHAT HIS COAT WAS MADE FOR BOTH ITS SLEEVES AND ITS SKIRTS WERE SO RAGGED AND FILTHY
BUT NOW CHICHIKOV PERCEIVED THIS PERSON TO BE A MAN RATHER THAN A WOMAN SINCE A FEMALE HOUSEKEEPER WOULD HAVE HAD NO BEARD TO SHAVE WHEREAS THE CHIN OF THE NEWCOMER WITH THE LOWER PORTION OF HIS CHEEKS STRONGLY RESEMBLED THE CURRY COMB WHICH IS USED FOR GROOMING HORSES
WHEREAS I SCARCELY GET ENOUGH TO EAT I WILL TAKE ANY PRICE FOR THEM THAT YOU MAY CARE TO OFFER TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT IT AND SHOULD THEY FIND
ENCLOSING A CATERPILLAR LASTLY IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM LAY A PILE OF ARTICLES WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN ADJUDGED UNWORTHY OF A PLACE ON THE TABLE YET WHAT THE PILE CONSISTED OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO SAY
LYING ON THE TABLE HE WENT ON BUT WHERE IT IS NOW I CANNOT THINK THAT COMES OF MY SERVANTS BEING SUCH RASCALS
HE WENT ON ALSO I FEEL BOUND TO SAY THAT I CAN SEE LITTLE GOOD IN THEIR COMING ONCE INTRODUCE THE ABOMINABLE CUSTOM OF FOLK PAYING CALLS AND FORTHWITH THERE WILL ENSUE SUCH RUIN TO THE MANAGEMENT OF ESTATES
AND THE OWNER OF STOREHOUSES AND SO FORTH THAT WERE CRAMMED WITH HOMESPUN CLOTH AND LINEN TANNED AND UNDRESSED SHEEPSKINS DRIED FISH AND EVERY CONCEIVABLE SPECIES OF PRODUCE NEVERTHELESS SUCH A PHENOMENON IS RARE IN RUSSIA
ABOUT SEVENTY SURELY NOT ALAS YES NEVER DOES A YEAR PASS WITHOUT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEM MAKING OFF YET SO GLUTTONOUS AND IDLE ARE MY SERFS THAT THEY ARE SIMPLY BURSTING WITH FOOD
WHOM ONE CAN NEVER SATISFY HOWEVER MUCH ONE MAY GIVE HIM FOR INSTANCE THAT CAPTAIN OF MINE IS CONSTANTLY BEGGING ME TO LET HIM HAVE A MEAL THOUGH HE IS ABOUT AS MUCH MY NEPHEW
JUST DESCRIBED DEPARTED THIS WORLD THE PROPOSAL SEEMED TO ASTONISH PLUSHKIN FOR HE SAT STARING OPEN EYED AT LENGTH HE INQUIRED MY DEAR SIR HAVE YOU SEEN MILITARY SERVICE NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF SOME FLOWERS AND FRUIT HALF A WATER MELON A BOAR'S HEAD AND THE PENDENT FORM OF A DEAD WILD DUCK ATTACHED TO THE CEILING THERE WAS A CHANDELIER IN A HOLLAND COVERING
AND THROW IN ANOTHER TWO KOPECKS PARDON ME BUT I CANNOT
WITH TOOTHLESS GUMS PLUSHKIN MURMURED SOMETHING IN REPLY BUT NOTHING IS KNOWN AS TO ITS PRECISE TERMS BEYOND THAT IT INCLUDED A STATEMENT THAT THE DEVIL WAS AT LIBERTY TO FLY AWAY WITH CHICHIKOV'S SENTIMENTS
FOR THE PURPOSE OF CUTTING THE MATTER SHORT AND OF DISPENSING WITH CIRCUMLOCUTION TO TRANSFER TO HIMSELF THE OBLIGATION OF PAYING THE TAXES
SEEING THAT THE DUST ON THE SAME WAS SO THICK THAT ANY HAND WHICH TOUCHED IT WOULD HAVE AT ONCE RESEMBLED A GLOVE PROMINENTLY PROTRUDING FROM THE PILE WAS THE SHAFT OF A WOODEN SPADE AND THE ANTIQUATED SOLE OF A SHOE NEVER WOULD ONE HAVE SUPPOSED THAT A LIVING CREATURE HAD TENANTED THE ROOM
BUT HOW CAN I GET FODDER MY LANDS ARE SMALL
AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS ROOM MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE HE FELL TO THINKING HOW BEST HE COULD CONTRIVE TO RECOMPENSE HIS GUEST FOR THE LATTER'S MEASURELESS BENEVOLENCE I WILL PRESENT HIM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF WITH A WATCH IT IS A GOOD SILVER ARTICLE
AND ARRIVED AT THE BUREAU AND GLANCING ROUND ONCE MORE CAREFULLY PACKED THE CASH IN ONE OF HIS MONEY BAGS WHERE DOUBTLESS
YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSING ME FOR NO REASON WHATEVER
WILL AMOUNT TO TWENTY FOUR ROUBLES NINETY SIX KOPECKS
WELL AND WHAT ARE YOU MAKING SUCH A NOISE ABOUT
AS IT HAPPENS THERE IS NEVER A BITE OF ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE SO HE HAS TO GO AWAY EMPTY BUT ABOUT THE LIST OF THOSE GOOD FOR NOTHING SOULS I HAPPEN TO POSSESS SUCH A LIST
BUT TWINKLED UNDER THEIR OVERHANGING BROWS LIKE THE EYES OF MICE WHEN WITH ATTENTIVE EARS AND SENSITIVE WHISKERS THEY SNUFF THE AIR AND PEER FORTH FROM THEIR HOLES TO SEE WHETHER A CAT OR A BOY MAY NOT BE IN THE VICINITY
A MAN OF GOOD SOCIETY WHERESOEVER ONE MAY BE A MAN OF THAT KIND NEVER EATS ANYTHING
BUT IN THE PRESENT CASE THERE WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM NOT A MENDICANT BUT A LANDOWNER AND A LANDOWNER POSSESSED OF FULLY A THOUSAND SERFS THE SUPERIOR OF ALL HIS NEIGHBOURS IN WEALTH OF FLOUR AND GRAIN
WHILE MOMENTARILY CHECKING THE SPEED OF HIS HAND LEST IT SHOULD MEANDER TOO MUCH OVER THE PAPER AND CRAWLING FROM LINE TO LINE AS THOUGH HE REGRETTED THAT THERE WAS SO LITTLE VACANT SPACE LEFT ON THE SHEET
HE INQUIRED YES REPLIED THE PERSON ADDRESSED THEN WERE IS HE
AND ENTER THE PARLOUR DRY SHOD SUBSEQUENTLY LEAVING THE BOOTS WHERE HE HAD FOUND THEM AND DEPARTING IN HIS FORMER BAREFOOTED CONDITION INDEED HAD ANY ONE ON A SLUSHY WINTER'S MORNING GLANCED FROM A WINDOW INTO THE SAID COURTYARD
YOU MIGHT ACCUSE ME OF ANY OTHER FAULT THAN THEFT
THE FACT THAT I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY RICH
CRUSHING THOSE BENEATH HIM AND STIFLING UNDER THOSE ON TOP OF HIM ENDEAVORING IN VAIN TO SHAKE OFF ALL THE EFFORTS WHICH WERE HEAPED UPON HIM
SHOVED ASIDE THE SCREEN WHICH HE LEANED AGAINST THE NEIGHBORING PALLET AND THUS UNMASKED THE BRAZIER FULL OF GLOWING COALS
FROM EIGHTEEN THIRTY TO EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT HE SCRAWLED PEARS ON THE WALLS ONE SUMMER EVENING WHEN LOUIS PHILIPPE WAS RETURNING HOME ON FOOT HE SAW A LITTLE FELLOW NO HIGHER THAN HIS KNEE
WHY DID YOU BRING SO MANY THEY WERE NOT NEEDED WHAT CAN YOU DO REPLIED THE MAN WITH THE CUDGEL THEY ALL WANTED TO BE IN IT THIS IS A BAD SEASON
FOR THEY THAT TOLD YOU THOSE TALES WERE LIARS AND SO IT FELL UPON THEM FOR BY LIKELIHOOD HAD NOT THE MIGHT OF GOD BEEN WITH ME I MIGHT NEVER HAVE ENDURED FOURTEEN KNIGHTS AND THEY ARMED AND AFORE PURPOSED AND I UNARMED AND NOT PURPOSED
TIE HIM TO THE LEG OF THE BED SAID HE
TO MENTION THE NAME WAS TO DELIVER THE WHOLE AFFAIR INTO THEIR HANDS AND TO TELL THEM MORE ABOUT IT THAN THERE WAS ANY NEED OF THEIR KNOWING HE WENT ON SIGN WHAT IS YOUR NAME
HAD BEEN TEMPORARILY DEPOSITED
A CERTAIN AUDACITY ON MATTERS OF RELIGION SETS OFF THE GAMIN TO BE STRONG MINDED IS AN IMPORTANT ITEM TO BE PRESENT AT EXECUTIONS CONSTITUTES A DUTY
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT HE WILL ACCEPT AND IN THAT CASE HE SERVES THE MASS CIVILLY THERE ARE TWO THINGS TO WHICH HE PLAYS TANTALUS AND WHICH HE ALWAYS DESIRES WITHOUT EVER ATTAINING THEM TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND TO GET HIS TROUSERS SEWED UP AGAIN
IN THE FIRST PLACE I MUST COMMUNICATE TO YOU AN OBSERVATION WHICH I HAVE MADE WHICH IS THAT YOU HAVE NOT UTTERED THE FAINTEST CRY THENARDIER WAS RIGHT THIS DETAIL WAS CORRECT ALTHOUGH IT HAD ESCAPED MARIUS IN HIS AGITATION
THAT NO HUMAN POWER CAN GET YOU OUT OF THIS AND THAT WE SHALL BE REALLY GRIEVED IF WE ARE FORCED TO PROCEED TO DISAGREEABLE EXTREMITIES I KNOW NEITHER YOUR NAME NOR YOUR ADDRESS BUT I WARN YOU THAT YOU WILL REMAIN BOUND UNTIL THE PERSON CHARGED WITH CARRYING THE LETTER
AND MY LORD SIR GAWAINE BOTH IN JOUSTS AND TOURNAMENTS AND IN BATTLES SET BOTH ON HORSEBACK AND ON FOOT I HAVE OFTEN RESCUED YOU AND MY LORD SIR GAWAINE AND MANY MO OF YOUR KNIGHTS IN MANY DIVERS PLACES FOR NOW I WILL MAKE AVAUNT
AND WHO IN THE FACE OF THIS NEW PHASE SAW NO INCONVENIENCE IN WAITING A WHILE LONGER WHO KNOWS WHETHER SOME CHANCE WOULD NOT ARISE WHICH WOULD DELIVER HIM FROM THE HORRIBLE ALTERNATIVE OF ALLOWING URSULE'S FATHER TO PERISH OR OF DESTROYING THE COLONEL'S SAVIOUR
JUSTICE WELL YOU HAVE NOT MADE AN OUTCRY THAT IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE TO HAVE THE POLICE AND THE COURTS COME IN ANY MORE THAN WE DO IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE LONG SUSPECTED IT
BUT INSOMUCH SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR MY SAKE MESEEMETH IT WAS MY PART TO SAVE HER LIFE AND PUT HER FROM THAT DANGER TILL BETTER RECOVER MIGHT COME AND NOW I THANK GOD SAID SIR LAUNCELOT THAT THE POPE HATH MADE HER PEACE
HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO ACQUIRE BY NO ONE KNOWS WHAT MYSTERIOUS MUTUAL INSTRUCTION ALL THE TALENTS WHICH CAN BE OF USE TO THE PUBLIC
THE GAMIN IN HIS PERFECT STATE POSSESSES ALL THE POLICEMEN OF PARIS AND CAN ALWAYS PUT THE NAME TO THE FACE OF ANY ONE WHICH HE CHANCES TO MEET HE CAN TELL THEM OFF ON THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS HE STUDIES THEIR HABITS
OF RIGHT TO REMEMBER THIS FOR AN I MIGHT HAVE YOUR GOOD WILL I WOULD TRUST TO GOD TO HAVE MY LORD ARTHUR'S GOOD GRACE CHAPTER SIXTEEN OF THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN SIR GAWAINE AND SIR LAUNCELOT WITH MUCH OTHER LANGUAGE
HE WAS HALF OUT WHEN SIX ROBUST FISTS SEIZED HIM AND DRAGGED HIM BACK ENERGETICALLY INTO THE HOVEL THESE WERE THE THREE CHIMNEY BUILDERS WHO HAD FLUNG THEMSELVES UPON HIM AT THE SAME TIME THE THENARDIER WOMAN HAD WOUND HER HANDS IN HIS HAIR
A SOMBRE CALM HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE WILD UPROAR WHICH HAD FILLED THE GARRET BUT A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE
THE BOY REPLIED THERE IS A CURE THERE IT WAS THERE IN FACT THAT THE PAPAL NUNCIO LIVED NEVERTHELESS WHATEVER MAY BE THE VOLTAIRIANISM OF THE SMALL GAMIN IF THE OCCASION TO BECOME A CHORISTER PRESENTS ITSELF
U F THAT'S IT URBAIN FABRE WELL SIGN IT U F THE PRISONER SIGNED AS TWO HANDS ARE REQUIRED TO FOLD THE LETTER GIVE IT TO ME I WILL FOLD IT THAT DONE THENARDIER RESUMED ADDRESS IT
I DARE ADVENTURE ME TO KEEP HER FROM AN HARDER SHOUR THAN EVER I KEPT HER IT SHALL NOT NEED YOU SAID THE BISHOP TO DREAD SO MUCH FOR WIT YOU WELL THE POPE MUST BE OBEYED
WITH TINY SCARLET STARS
YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE THAT AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE TROUBLED YOU ON THAT ACCOUNT YOU WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE BEEN GAGGED AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY THIS ROOM IS VERY PRIVATE THAT'S ITS ONLY RECOMMENDATION BUT IT HAS THAT IN ITS FAVOR
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE POSITION PROFIT BY THE FACT TO MAKE THEMSELVES RIDICULOUS
BE EASY I HAVE IT IN MY BOSOM A MINUTE HAD NOT ELAPSED WHEN THE SOUND OF THE CRACKING OF A WHIP WAS HEARD WHICH RAPIDLY RETREATED AND DIED AWAY GOOD GROWLED THENARDIER THEY'RE GOING AT A FINE PACE
AND THEN SAY YE UNTO MY MOST REDOUBTED KING THAT I WILL SAY LARGELY FOR THE QUEEN THAT I SHALL NONE EXCEPT FOR DREAD NOR FEAR BUT THE KING HIMSELF AND MY LORD SIR GAWAINE AND THAT IS MORE FOR THE KING'S LOVE THAN FOR HIMSELF
THAT OTHER HAS A MANIA FOR PULLING PERSON'S EARS ET CETERA ET CETERA CHAPTER NINE THE OLD SOUL OF GAUL THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THAT BOY IN POQUELIN THE SON OF THE FISH MARKET BEAUMARCHAIS HAD SOMETHING OF IT
AND WHO MADE NO MOVEMENT HE ADDED IS BOULATRUELLE DEAD
SUCH ANOTHER IS RIDICULOUS ALL THESE WORDS TRAITOR MALICIOUS GREAT RIDICULOUS HAVE A PARTICULAR MEANING IN HIS MOUTH THAT ONE IMAGINES THAT HE OWNS THE PONT NEUF AND HE PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM WALKING ON THE CORNICE OUTSIDE THE PARAPET
AND THE DUSKY MEADOWS BUT THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE DREAM STICKS AND A DREAM FIRE
IN WHICH MISTER SANDFORD WAS TREATED AND MISS WOODLEY TURNED TO HIM WITH A BENEVOLENT SMILE UPON HER FACE HOPING TO SET HIM AN EXAMPLE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SHOULD RECEIVE THE REPROACH HER GOOD WISHES DID NOT SUCCEED
HE GAVE IT TO CUTHBERT DO YOU WANT TO GO THERE HE SAID YOU'VE SAVED MY LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE AND YOU'VE ONLY TO SAY THE WORD
IT WAS AGREED THE ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE INSTEAD OF RECEIVING THIS ABRUPT PROPOSAL WITH UNEASINESS MISS MILNER TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL PRESENT IMMEDIATELY CONSENTED
EVERY RIVULET INTO A STAGNATED POOL AND EVERY SINGING BIRD INTO A CROAKING RAVEN
SHE WAS JUST NINETEEN SHE'D BEEN PADDLING IN THE STREAM I CALLED OUT TO HER AND SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT ME SHE WAS IN AN OLD FROCK BUT SHE LOOKED QUITE THE LADY HER EYES WAS DARK AND SHE WAS SMILING HE MOVED HIS HEAD A LITTLE
YES I'D LIKE TO HE SAID IT WOULD BE RATHER EXCITING BEARDY NED BENT FORWARD AND TOOK A STICK FROM THE FIRE HE LIT THE END OF THE CANDLE BETWEEN CUTHBERT'S FINGERS NOW BLOW IT OUT HE SAID AND YOU'LL GO OUT WITH IT IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT YOU'LL BE BACK IN A TICK
BUT ALL TIMES ARE NOT GOOD FOR FUNNING AND JESTING THE FOX REPLIED O IGNORAMUS IN GOOD SOOTH JESTING HATH A LIMIT WHICH THE JESTER MUST NOT OVERPASS
SHE HAD LEFT HIM WITH A LITTLE GIRL ONLY TEN MONTHS OLD AND THAT WAS WHY NED HAD LET HIS BEARD GROW HE HADN'T TIME HE SAID TO LOOK AFTER THE LITTLE GIRL AND SHAVE HIS FACE EVERY DAY AS WELL
AND THE FOX SAID TO HIMSELF I HAVE A MIND TO SET UP A FRIENDSHIP WITH THIS CROW AND MAKE A COMRADE OF HIM
WHILE HE LOOKED AT CUTHBERT HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED HE SAID WHERE CANDLES GOES TO WHERE THEY GOES TO WHEN THEY GOES OUT NO I DON'T THINK SO SAID CUTHBERT WHERE DO THEY GO TO
SHE WOULD BE SURE TO DROWN BECAUSE BEARDY NED WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT
OVERLOOKING THE VINEYARD AND STANDING THERE
AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD GO FAR AWAY AND NOT COME BACK FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS
ANSWERED THE CROW THOU HAST MY LEAVE TO LET ME HEAR THY COMMUNICATION
DRAWING TOWARDS HER HOUSE WHERE LORD ELMWOOD WAS INVITED TO DINE
AND HATH EATEN HIS FILL OF IT HE AND HIS FAMILY AND HATH LEFT MUCH EVERY LIVING BEING HATH EATEN OF IT AND IF THOU TAKE OF IT IN THEY TURN THOU ART WORTHIER THEREOF THAN ANY OTHER
SHE EXPECTED HE WAS ANGRY
OF COURSE CUTHBERT COULDN'T ALWAYS BE BOTHERED TO GO UP THE RIVER WITH THE GIRLS
SO THE FOLK LOOKED INTO THE CLEFT AND SPYING THE WOLF SET TO PELTING HIM WITH HEAVY STONES AND THEY STINTED NOT SMITING HIM WITH STONES AND STICKS AND STABBING HIM WITH SPEARS
AND KNOW O MY FRIEND THAT THOU ART MY NEIGHBOUR
HE HAD PUT A COUPLE OF BLANKETS THERE AND AN OLD WATERPROOF AND STANDING ON THE BEACH WERE A CUP AND KETTLE
BUT AS SOON AS THE BLOODSUCKER WAS AWARE OF THE SEARCH HE TURNED TO FLEE AND COMING
THOSE INVOLUNTARY SIGHS HOWEVER THAT MISS WOODLEY HAD LONG AGO OBSERVED
OR CONSENT TO BECOME HIS WIFE IN ANSWER TO THE ALTERNATIVE THUS OFFERED SHE APPEARED AVERSE TO BOTH PROPOSITIONS AND YET CAME TO NO EXPLANATION WHY BUT LEFT HER GUARDIAN AT THE END OF THE CONFERENCE
FOR BEARDY NED IN SPITE OF HIS GREAT TROUBLE WAS ALWAYS FULL OF A SECRET HAPPINESS AND HE HAD MADE THIS LITTLE SONG OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD THAT HE USED TO SING EVERY TWO OR THREE HOURS THE WICKEDEST GIRL THERE WAS THE WICKEDEST GIRL THERE IS
AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LORD FREDERICK SAID MISS WOODLEY TO HERSELF BUT HER UNDERSTANDING COMPELS HER TO SEE HIS FAULTS
SHE WAS OBLIGED AT LENGTH TO GO BY HERSELF HOW MUCH DOES THE DIFFERENCE OF EXTERIOR CIRCUMSTANCES INFLUENCE NOT ONLY THE MANNERS BUT EVEN THE PERSONS OF SOME PEOPLE MISS MILNER IN LORD ELMWOOD'S DRAWING ROOM
MISS MILNER DID NOT LIKE MISTER SANDFORD
AND UPROOT THE VINES FROM BASE
IT IS THAT VERY TENDERNESS WHICH FRIGHTENS ME WHICH INTIMIDATES AND STRIKES ME DUMB
ELMWOOD HOUSE OR RATHER CASTLE THE SEAT OF LORD ELMWOOD WAS ONLY A FEW MILES DISTANT FROM THIS RESIDENCE
LEFT THE CUB ALIVE AND BRED IT BY HIS SIDE
AND THE CARE OF SO DANGEROUS A PERSON GIVEN INTO OTHER HANDS DORRIFORTH ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROPRIETY OF THIS ADVICE BUT LAMENTED THE DIFFICULTY OF PLEASING HIS WARD AS TO THE QUALITY OF HER LOVER
THAT THE BIGGEST OF THE TROUT HAD THEIR NESTS WHERE FISHERMEN WITH FLIES COULDN'T REACH THEM BUT THERE WERE SOME BIG TROUT TOO THAT LIVED UNDER THE MEADOW BANKS AND USED TO PUT UP THEIR NOSES IN THE SUMMER EVENINGS
WITH MY FANGS FOR THOU KNOWEST WE EXCEED NOT THAT RECOMPENSE SO SAYING SHE GAVE HIM A BITE WHEREOF HE DIED AND I LIKEN THEE O DULLARD TO THE SERPENT IN HER DEALINGS WITH THAT MAN HAST THOU NOT HEARD WHAT THE POET SAITH
SHE IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCED A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE HAD NOT ACTED PROPERLY AT LORD ELMWOOD'S
HER SATISFACTION WAS AS EVIDENT AS EVERY OTHER PERSON'S
OF THE GOODLINESS OF TRUE FRIENDSHIP
THAT I SHALL NEVER ENTER A HOUSE IN WHICH YOU ARE THE MISTRESS NOR ANY HOUSE I AM CERTAIN MISTER SANDFORD BUT IN WHICH YOU ARE YOURSELF THE MASTER
THE TWO PARTIES WOULD OCCASIONALLY JOIN AND OF COURSE SANDFORD AND SHE AT THOSE TIMES MET YET SO DISTANT
AND DRANK TEA AND LIZ WHO WAS ALMOST ASLEEP HAD A CUP OF MILK AND THEN THEY ATE BISCUITS AND JAM OUT OF A POT AND BEARDY NED FILLED HIS PIPE HE HAD MADE LIZ TAKE OFF HER WET CLOTHES OF COURSE
AND WHO SHOWETH NO CONSTANCY IN FRIENDSHIP THE MOUSE REPLIED EVEN SO O MY FRIEND AND I DELIGHT IN THEE AND IN THEY NEIGHBORHOOD BUT WHAT BE THE MOTIVE OF THIS SPEECH
THAT I FIRST SAW MY LIZ I MEAN HER MOTHER PERHAPS IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING IT WAS WHERE I FIRST SAW THIS ONE TOO
THERE AIN'T NO TIME THERE NOT AS WE RECKONS TIME BUT ONCE YOU'VE BEEN THERE
THE COMPLICATION WAS OF THIS NATURE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S CHARACTERISTIC QUALITY AS A POLITICIAN THAT SPECIAL INDIVIDUAL QUALIFICATION THAT EVERY RISING FUNCTIONARY POSSESSES
WELL THOUGHT RAOUL AFTER OR RATHER BEFORE MYSELF YOU HAVE A MASTER TO CONSULT THAT MASTER BEING THE KING
BEGAN COVERING THEM OVER WITH STRAW WHILE KERBALAY BEGAN HURRIEDLY HARNESSING THE ASSES SMUGGLING PERHAPS THOUGHT THE DEACON HERE WAS THE FALLEN TREE WITH THE DRIED PINE NEEDLES
WHO SHOWED HIS HEAD FROM AN ARBOR COVERED WITH JASMINE WHICH HE WAS OCCUPIED IN TRIMMING MY HORSES GRIMAUD CONTINUED THE COUNT WHY THIS ORDER MONSIEUR INQUIRED RAOUL WE SHALL SET OFF IN A FEW HOURS
AND THE FRENCH WORK ON EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS THAT HE HAD BEGUN OVER THE EASY CHAIR THERE HUNG IN A GOLD FRAME AN OVAL PORTRAIT OF ANNA A FINE PAINTING BY A CELEBRATED ARTIST ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH GLANCED AT IT
PROVED THAT THE CONDITION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES WAS EXCEEDINGLY FLOURISHING THAT THE PROPOSED RECONSTRUCTION MIGHT BE THE RUIN OF THEIR PROSPERITY AND THAT IF THERE WERE ANYTHING WRONG IT AROSE MAINLY FROM THE FAILURE ON THE PART OF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S DEPARTMENT
NO DOUBT KERBALAY'S WIFE OR DAUGHTER WERE BRINGING SACKS OF SOMETHING OUT OF THE DUHAN AND PUTTING THEM ON MAIZE STRAW IN THE CART NEAR THE CART STOOD A PAIR OF ASSES HANGING THEIR HEADS
THAT IS THE SECOND TIME YOU HAVE SAID SO RAOUL IT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY YOU REQUIRE MY FORMAL CONSENT AND YOU HAVE IT WE NEED TALK NO MORE ON THE SUBJECT THEREFORE COME AND SEE MY NEW PLANTATIONS RAOUL
IT IS LOYAL IN YOU TO SUBMIT YOURSELF VOLUNTARILY TO THIS DOUBLE PROOF I WILL GRANT YOUR REQUEST WITHOUT DELAY RAOUL THE COUNT APPROACHED THE WINDOW AND LEANING OUT CALLED TO GRIMAUD
THEY ARE SURE TO BE SAVED HE SAID ALOUD LIGHTING A CIGARETTE BY WHAT STANDARD MUST ONE MEASURE MEN'S QUALITIES TO JUDGE RIGHTLY OF THEM
SINKING AT ONCE FROM THE LOFTY TONE HE HAD ASSUMED WHAT WAS YOUR REPLY MONSIEUR INQUIRED THE COUNT STAMPING HIS FEET UPON THE GROUND MONSIEUR MY SWORD WAS IN MY HAND IMMEDIATELY MY ADVERSARY PLACED HIMSELF ON GUARD
FOR YOU AND FOR OUR SON I AM FULLY PERSUADED THAT YOU HAVE REPENTED AND DO REPENT OF WHAT HAS CALLED FORTH THE PRESENT LETTER AND THAT YOU WILL COOPERATE WITH ME IN ERADICATING THE CAUSE OF OUR ESTRANGEMENT AND FORGETTING THE PAST
A KARENIN P S I ENCLOSE THE MONEY WHICH MAY BE NEEDED FOR YOUR EXPENSES HE READ THE LETTER THROUGH AND FELT PLEASED WITH IT AND ESPECIALLY THAT HE HAD REMEMBERED TO ENCLOSE MONEY
IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHE IS SO GOOD SO GENTLE AND PURE THAT YOUR MIND SO PERFECT IN ITS PENETRATION OUGHT TO APPRECIATE HER ACCORDINGLY DOES ANY SECRET REPUGNANCE OR ANY HEREDITARY DISLIKE
FOUR ETHNOGRAPHICAL FIVE MATERIAL AND SIX RELIGIOUS POINTS OF VIEW THIRDLY THAT EVIDENCE SHOULD BE REQUIRED FROM THE RIVAL DEPARTMENT
TO INVESTIGATE THE DEPLORABLE CONDITION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES FROM THE ONE POLITICAL TWO ADMINISTRATIVE
AFTER WAITING TEN MINUTES THE DEACON CAME OUT OF THE DRYING SHED AND TAKING OFF HIS BLACK HAT THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE NOTICED HE BEGAN THREADING HIS WAY AMONG THE BUSHES AND STRIPS OF MAIZE ALONG THE BANK
HAD BEEN INITIATED BY THE PREDECESSOR OF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S PREDECESSOR AND VAST SUMS OF MONEY HAD ACTUALLY BEEN SPENT AND WERE STILL BEING SPENT ON THIS BUSINESS AND UTTERLY UNPRODUCTIVELY
BY THE MERE FORCE OF INERTIA MANY PEOPLE GAINED THEIR LIVELIHOOD BY THE BOARD OF IRRIGATION ESPECIALLY ONE HIGHLY CONSCIENTIOUS AND MUSICAL FAMILY ALL THE DAUGHTERS PLAYED ON STRINGED INSTRUMENTS AND ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH KNEW THE FAMILY
AND FOLLOWED THE ROAD TO BLOIS WHILE THE MARRIAGE FESTIVITIES OF MONSIEUR AND THE PRINCESS OF ENGLAND WERE BEING CELEBRATED WITH EXCEEDING ANIMATION BY THE COURTIERS BUT TO THE DESPAIR OF DE GUICHE AND BUCKINGHAM RAOUL LOST NO TIME ON THE ROAD
DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A DON DIEGO HIS NAME I SAY YOU INSIST UPON IT I DEMAND IT THE VICOMTE DE WARDES VERY WELL SAID ATHOS TRANQUILLY I KNOW HIM
HE LOOKS LIKE AN OLD MAN HOW RUDE IT IS OF THEM SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE POST OFFICE LOOKING AT HIS WATCH IT MAY BE LEARNED MANNERS TO BE LATE BUT TO MY THINKING IT'S HOGGISH
THE SHRIEKS OF WOMEN THE SOUND OF A CARRIAGE INTERRUPTED THE DEACON'S THOUGHTS HE GLANCED OUT OF THE DOOR AND SAW A CARRIAGE AND IN IT THREE PERSONS LAEVSKY SHESHKOVSKY
TO CARRY OUT THE MEASURES PRESCRIBED BY LAW NOW ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH INTENDED TO DEMAND FIRST THAT A NEW COMMISSION SHOULD BE FORMED WHICH SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO INVESTIGATE THE CONDITION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES ON THE SPOT
ON THE CONDITION I REPEAT CONTINUED ATHOS THAT YOU TELL ME THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO SPOKE OF YOUR MOTHER IN THAT WAY WHAT NEED IS THERE THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW HIS NAME
ACCOMPANIED BY GRIMAUD KEEN SIGHTED AND PENETRATING A MERE GLANCE AT HIS SON TOLD HIM THAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY HAD BEFALLEN HIM
MARCIE OF CLIFF HOUSE THE MARCELLA OF THE PRESENT SAW WITH A MIXTURE OF AMUSEMENT AND SELF PITY THAT ONE GREAT
INCE'S OUTLINES OF ENGLISH HISTORY
THE YOUNG LADIES CONCERNED EVIDENTLY FELT THEMSELVES VERY MUCH AT HOME
FIGURING GENERALLY AS THE
MARMION TO THE KIND OFFICES OF THE
SARCASM OR AMUSEMENT
SEEMLY AND PLEASANT THINGS OF A HOUSE IN LONDON OF A LARGE AND BRIGHT NURSERY OF A SMILING MOTHER WHO TOOK
AND AS SHE LOOKED
OF GAMES LITTLE FRIENDS AND BIRTHDAY PARTIES
SOMETHING GENERALLY INTERPOSED
DILAPIDATED FURNITURE AND THEN OUT AGAIN TO WOODS AND LAWNS
THE BOYCES AND IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN SIX WEEKS SINCE MARCELLA HAD RECEIVED HER SUMMONS HOME FROM THE STUDENTS BOARDING HOUSE IN KENSINGTON WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LATELY LIVING
SHE WAS ONE OF THE BOYCES OF BROOKSHIRE
AND THAT THESE DAYS IN BED REPRESENTED CRISES WHICH MUST BE BORNE WITH
THE SIZE OF THE TREES THE WIDE UPLANDS OF THE FALLING VALLEY TO THE LEFT OF THE AVENUE
FOR SOME FOURTEEN HOURS THEREFORE ON THESE DAYS OF
WHICH NOW SEEMED SO FAR AWAY HER FATHER HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN POINTED IT OUT TO THE CHILD AND TAUGHT HER TO BE PROUD OF IT AND MORE THAN ONCE HER CHILDISH EYE HAD BEEN CAUGHT
IRRITABLE SENSE OF SOCIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HERSELF AND HER COMPANIONS
HER ROMANTIC FRIENDSHIP WITH THE ADORED OF ENGLAND MAKING HER ALL THE TIME THE OBSERVED OF ALL OBSERVERS BRINGING HER A THOUSAND
IN THIS IMPRESSION WITH AVIDITY YET AT THE SAME MOMENT SHE NOTICED INVOLUNTARILY THE GATELESS GAP AT THE END OF THE AVENUE THE CHOKED CONDITION OF THE GARDEN PATHS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LAWN
GENERALLY OF WHITE MUSLIN WITH CHERRY COLOURED RIBBONS SHE WENT HERE AND THERE WITH THE PRINCESS LAUGHING AND TALKING QUITE CALMLY WITH THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE LAND
RECTOR WAS A CALAMITY HARDLY TO BE BORNE IF THE EXIT OF THE SCHOOL PARTY WERE DELAYED BY ANY ACCIDENT SO THAT MISTER AND MISSUS ELLERTON OVERTOOK THEM IN THE CHURCHYARD
IT IS TO BE FEARED OR ANY WISH TO BE GOOD BUT ONLY AN ACHING INMOST SENSE OF CHILDISH LONELINESS AND HELPLESSNESS
PERPETUAL COLDS TO TRY THE EFFECTS OF A DAY'S SECLUSION AND SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
DOZEN OTHERS IN THE COMFORTLESS LAVATORY SHE HATED THE MEALS IN THE LONG SCHOOLROOM WHERE BECAUSE TWICE MEAT WAS FORBIDDEN AND TWICE PUDDING ALLOWED
AND MIGHT SHE HOPED DO HER GOOD FOR I DO BELIEVE A GREAT PART OF IT'S LIVER OR NERVES
NINE TO FOURTEEN AND WHERE
AND AN ADORATION TO TAKE THE ADORATION FIRST
MARCELLA WAS LEFT ALMOST WHOLLY ALONE NOTHING BUT A WILD
THROWING THE SENNA TEA IN MARTHA'S FACE AND RUSHING DOWNSTAIRS IN HER NIGHTGOWN
IMAGINATIVE CHILD WELL AWARE IN SPITE OF APPEARANCES
AND THE UNSIGHTLY TUFTS OF GRASS SPOTTING THE BROAD GRAVEL TERRACE BENEATH HER WINDOW IT IS A HEAVENLY PLACE ALL SAID AND DONE
SHE HAD BEEN AN AVERAGE CHILD OF THE QUICK AND CLEVER TYPE
SHE HATED GETTING UP IN THE WINTRY DARK AND HER COLD
WHO HAPPENED TO BE KNOWN TO SOME OF THE BOYCE FAMILY HE AND HIS WIFE THEY HAD NO CHILDREN DID THEIR DUTY
AND PROPPING HER FACE UPON HER HANDS DEVOURED THE SCENE
INVARIABLY HUNGERED FIERCELY FOR MORE MUTTON AND SCORNED HER SECOND COURSE
MISS FREDERICK'S HAD FOR SOME TIME TAKEN NOTICE OF MARCELLA AND AT LENGTH WON HER BY NOTHING ELSE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THAN A REMARKABLE GIFT FOR STORY TELLING
OR BY THROWING HERSELF IN FRONT OF THE
SHE WAS MARCELLA BOYCE A FINISHED AND GROWN UP YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY ONE
AND THE BIG GIRL THE STOUT AND
TO CHOOSE NEXT MORNING BETWEEN ANOTHER DUMB DAY OF SENNA TEA AND GRUEL
NINE YEARS OLD THERE WAS THE DOMINANT FACT IN THESE MOTLEY UNCOMFORTABLE YEARS BEHIND HER
ALTERNATELY MYSTIFIED AND
YOU GREAT YOU GREAT BIG BULLY YOU
AUNT HAD GIVEN HER SHE PROBABLY NEVER READ ANY OF THEM THROUGH SHE HAD NOT A PARTICLE OF INDUSTRY OR METHOD IN HER COMPOSITION BUT SHE LIVED IN THEM THE PARTS WHICH IT
MARCELLA HAD BETTER GO ON WITH HER STUDIES AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
LAVISHED HER TINY WEEKLY ALLOWANCE THE MAD GAMES OF TIG WHICH SHE LED AND ORGANISED IN THE TOP PLAYGROUND AND THE KINDNESSES OF
DRIVING HER PERPETUALLY INTO THE MOST CRUDE AND RIDICULOUS OUTBREAKS
STORMY BREAST AN OVERMASTERING ABSORBING PASSION FOR THESE TWO PERSONS
HE'S ALMOST AS STRONG AS FATHER THOUGH HE IS SO OLD YOU GET ALONG WITH YOU AND BEHAVE YOURSELF AND DON'T TALK STUFF TO ME WHEREUPON MARCELLA
MISSUS ELLERTON'S PONY CARRIAGE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO PASS ALONG THAT ROAD
IT COULD BE SORTED OUT BY A PRISM INTO AN INFINITE NUMBER OF CONSTITUENT PARTS
DEAR ME I THOUGHT I HAD NOT DINED BUT I SEE I HAVE IT WAS BY THIS CONTINUOUS APPLICATION THAT THE PRINCIPIA WAS ACCOMPLISHED PROBABLY NOTHING OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT SOMETHING OF THE SAME ABSORBED UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND FREEDOM FROM INTERRUPTION
IT IS AS WHEN ONE IS CONSIDERING SHAKSPEARE KING LEAR MACBETH OTHELLO SURELY A SUFFICIENT ACHIEVEMENT BUT THE MASTERPIECE REMAINS COMPARISONS IN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ARE BUT LITTLE HELP PERHAPS
WHO HAS EVER LIVED IN A WAY THAT WE CAN FIND NO PARALLEL FOR IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS OTHER NATIONS ADMIT HIS SCIENTIFIC PRE EMINENCE WITH AS MUCH ALACRITY AS WE DO
IT IS VERY LIKE ONE OF THOSE ANECDOTES WHICH ARE EASILY INVENTED AND BELIEVED IN AND VERY OFTEN TURN OUT ON SCRUTINY TO HAVE NO FOUNDATION FORTUNATELY THIS ANECDOTE IS WELL AUTHENTICATED AND MOREOVER IS INTRINSICALLY PROBABLE
IN A WINDOW SHUTTER INSERTED THE PRISM IN THE LIGHT AND RECEIVED THE DEFLECTED BEAM ON A WHITE SCREEN TURNING THE PRISM ABOUT TILL IT WAS DEVIATED AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE THE PATCH ON THE SCREEN WAS NOT A ROUND DISK
WHAT IF IT SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE TRUE AFTER ALL HE TOOK OUT HIS OLD PAPERS AND BEGAN AGAIN THE CALCULATION IF GRAVITY WERE THE FORCE KEEPING THE MOON IN ITS ORBIT IT WOULD FALL TOWARD THE EARTH SIXTEEN FEET EVERY MINUTE
TO WHICH HE FELT COMPELLED TO FIND ANSWERS MANY MEN WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THIS PART OF THE WORK AND TAKEN IT AS EVIDENCE OF INTEREST AND SUCCESS BUT TO NEWTON'S SHY AND RETIRING DISPOSITION THESE DISCUSSIONS WERE MERELY PAINFUL HE WRITES INDEED HIS ANSWERS WITH GREAT PATIENCE AND ABILITY
WHICH I OUGHT NOT TO DIMINISH NOW TIS YOURS
WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TAKING ORDERS YET IT WAS RATHER DISGRACEFUL THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE BETTER OFF SO AN APPEAL WAS MADE TO THE GOVERNMENT ON HIS BEHALF AND LORD HALIFAX WHO EXERTED HIMSELF STRONGLY IN THE MATTER SUCCEEDING TO OFFICE ON THE ACCESSION OF WILLIAM THE THIRD
THE FAME OF HIS MATHEMATICAL GENIUS CAME TO THE EARS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND A MOTION WAS MADE TO GET HIM ELECTED A FELLOW OF THAT BODY THE ROYAL SOCIETY THE OLDEST AND MOST FAMOUS OF ALL SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES WITH A CONTINUOUS EXISTENCE
OF A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN HE COULD REALLY STATE OR PROVE BY INDISCREET FRIENDS THESE TWO GREAT MEN WERE SET SOMEWHAT AT LOGGERHEADS AND WORSE MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HAD THEY NOT MANAGED TO COME TO CLOSE QUARTERS AND CORRESPOND PRIVATELY IN A QUITE FRIENDLY MANNER
AMONG THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS BEING BOYLE HOOKE CHRISTOPHER WREN AND OTHER LESS FAMOUS NAMES BOYLE WAS A GREAT EXPERIMENTER A WORTHY FOLLOWER OF DOCTOR GILBERT HOOKE BEGAN AS HIS ASSISTANT BUT BEING OF A MOST EXTRAORDINARY INGENUITY
AND THIRD FOR DEFRAYING THE COST OF ITS PUBLICATION OUT OF HIS OWN SCANTY PURSE FOR THOUGH HE ULTIMATELY SUFFERED NO PECUNIARY LOSS RATHER THE CONTRARY YET THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE RISK IN BRINGING OUT A BOOK
WITH HIS VALUABLE BURDEN HALLEY HASTENED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND TOLD THEM WHAT HE HAD DISCOVERED THE SOCIETY AT HIS REPRESENTATION WROTE TO MISTER NEWTON ASKING LEAVE THAT IT MIGHT BE PRINTED TO THIS HE CONSENTED
THE IDEA PERHAPS DID NOT NATURALLY OCCUR TO HIM ANY MORE THAN THE IDEA OF PUBLISHING HIS WORK DID HE WAS ALWAYS A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN AND A SINCERE CHRISTIAN THOUGH SOMEWHAT OF THE ARIAN OR UNITARIAN PERSUASION SO AT LEAST IT IS ASSERTED BY ORTHODOX DIVINES WHO UNDERSTAND THESE MATTERS
AND YET IF ONE REALIZES HIS METHOD OF WORK AND THE CALM UNINTERRUPTED FLOW OF ALL HIS EARLIER LIFE PERHAPS HIS ACHIEVEMENTS BECOME MORE INTELLIGIBLE WHEN ASKED HOW HE MADE HIS DISCOVERIES HE REPLIED
THAT IS THE WAY QUIET STEADY CONTINUOUS THINKING UNINTERRUPTED AND UNHARASSED BROODING MUCH MAY BE DONE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS MUCH OUGHT TO BE SACRIFICED TO OBTAIN THOSE CONDITIONS
I SAY FORTUNATELY BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS PAINFUL TO HAVE TO GIVE UP THESE CHILD LEARNT ANECDOTES LIKE ALFRED AND THE CAKES AND SO ON THIS ANECDOTE OF THE APPLE WE NEED NOT RESIGN THE TREE WAS BLOWN DOWN IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY
CAMBRIDGE REBELLED AND SENT EIGHT OF ITS MEMBERS AMONG THEM MISTER NEWTON TO PLEAD THEIR CAUSE BEFORE THE COURT OF HIGH COMMISSION JUDGE JEFFREYS PRESIDED OVER THE COURT AND THREATENED AND BULLIED WITH HIS USUAL INSOLENCE
AND THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS BESIDES A GOOD NUMBER OF MINOR RESULTS BINOMIAL THEOREM REFLECTING TELESCOPE SEXTANT AND THE LIKE ONE WOULD THINK IT ENOUGH FOR ONE MAN'S LIFE WORK
WITH A MIRROR WEIGHING FOUR TONS THE SEXTANT AS USED BY NAVIGATORS
IT DIFFERED FROM SUNLIGHT IN BEING SIMPLE WITH MANY INGENIOUS AND BEAUTIFULLY SIMPLE EXPERIMENTS WHICH ARE QUOTED IN FULL IN SEVERAL BOOKS ON OPTICS HE CLINCHED THE ARGUMENT AND ESTABLISHED HIS DISCOVERY WHITE LIGHT WAS NOT SIMPLE BUT COMPOUND
INSTEAD OF SETTLING HIMSELF DOWN TO THE WORK IN WHICH HE WAS SO PRE EMINENTLY GREAT WELL I EXPECT YOUR TRULY GREAT MAN NEVER REALIZES HOW GREAT HE IS AND SELDOM KNOWS WHERE HIS REAL STRENGTH LIES CERTAINLY NEWTON DID NOT KNOW IT
REPLACING AND COVERING UP THE BONES AGAIN
HE HAD SHREWD INKLINGS OF THE TRUTH THOUGH HIS GUESSES WERE BASED ON LITTLE ELSE THAN A MOST SAGACIOUS INTUITION HE SURMISED ALSO THAT GRAVITY WAS THE FORCE CONCERNED AND ASSERTED THAT THE PATH OF AN ORDINARY PROJECTILE WAS AN ELLIPSE LIKE THE PATH OF A PLANET WHICH IS QUITE RIGHT
AS HE SURELY MUST HAD HE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN GREATNESS NO SELF CONSCIOUSNESS WAS THE LAST THING THAT AFFECTED HIM IT IS FOR A GREAT MAN'S CONTEMPORARIES TO DISCOVER HIM TO MAKE MUCH OF HIM AND TO PUT HIM IN SURROUNDINGS WHERE HE MAY FLOURISH LUXURIANTLY
THE NEWLY KNOWN SIZE OF THE EARTH WOULD MODIFY THE FIGURES WITH INTENSE EXCITEMENT HE RUNS THROUGH THE WORKING HIS MIND LEAPS BEFORE HIS HAND AND AS HE PERCEIVES THE ANSWER TO BE COMING OUT RIGHT ALL THE INFINITE MEANING AND SCOPE OF HIS MIGHTY DISCOVERY FLASHES UPON HIM
AND HAD A CONSIDERABLE TASTE AND FACULTY FOR SCIENCE THESE THEN WERE THE LUMINARIES OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AT THE TIME WE ARE SPEAKING OF AND TO THEM NEWTON'S FIRST SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION WAS SUBMITTED HE COMMUNICATED TO THEM AN ACCOUNT OF HIS REFLECTING TELESCOPE
WHICH GAVE HIM A DEAL OF TROUBLE AND NO WONDER FOR IN THE WAY HE HAS PUT IT THERE NEVER WAS A MAN YET LIVING WHO COULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING
BUT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE THE ENJOYMENT OF HER HUSBAND'S COMPANY WITHOUT ANY DANGER AND HE TOLD HER THAT IN THE COMPANY OF HER HUSBAND SHE MIGHT HAVE GREAT BOLDNESS FROM A GOOD CONSCIENCE BOTH BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE MEN NAY THAT SHE WOULD ACT BETTER LIKE HIS MISTRESS
AS DID ALSO HIS DREAMS WHICH HE SAW AND RELATED TO HIS FATHER AND TO THEM WHICH FORETOLD HIS FUTURE HAPPINESS IT BEING USUAL WITH MANKIND TO ENVY THEIR VERY NEAREST RELATIONS SUCH THEIR PROSPERITY
IN WHOSE CASE THE INFIRMITY OF HIS SMALL AGE SHOULD RATHER PROCURE HIM MERCY AND MOVE THEM TO UNITE TOGETHER IN THE CARE OF HIS PRESERVATION
IN WHICH IT WAS THE CUSTOM FOR WOMEN TO COME TO THE PUBLIC SOLEMNITY SHE PRETENDED TO HER HUSBAND THAT SHE WAS SICK AS CONTRIVING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOLITUDE AND LEISURE THAT SHE MIGHT ENTREAT JOSEPH AGAIN WHICH OPPORTUNITY BEING OBTAINED SHE USED MORE KIND WORDS TO HIM THAN BEFORE
THESE DWELT IN THAT PART OF IDUMEA WHICH IS CALLED GEBALITIS AND THAT DENOMINATED FROM AMALEK AMALEKITIS FOR IDUMEA WAS A LARGE COUNTRY AND DID THEN PRESERVE THE NAME OF THE WHOLE
AND SHREWD ALSO IN UNDERSTANDING AND GOD EXERCISED SUCH A PROVIDENCE OVER HIM AND SUCH A CARE OF HIS HAPPINESS AS TO BRING HIM THE GREATEST BLESSINGS EVEN OUT OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE MOST SORROWFUL CONDITION
AS SOON AS HE SAW HIM IN A CHEERFUL AND JOYFUL DISPOSITION AND BEGAN TO INTRODUCE A DISCOURSE ABOUT DAVID WHAT UNJUST ACTION O FATHER EITHER LITTLE OR GREAT HAST THOU FOUND SO EXCEPTIONABLE IN DAVID AS TO INDUCE THEE TO ORDER US TO SLAY A MAN WHO HATH BEEN OF GREAT ADVANTAGE TO THY OWN PRESERVATION
AND THE TRUTH OF THE FACT WOULD BE MORE POWERFUL THAN THOSE THAT INFLICTED THE PUNISHMENTS UPON HIM
AND BECAUSE WE ARE NOT WILLING TO INJURE HIM THAT HAS THUS DISTRESSED US THOUGH IT WERE FOR OUR OWN PLEASURE THE CUPBEARER THEREFORE AS WAS NATURAL TO DO REJOICED TO HEAR SUCH AN INTERPRETATION OF HIS DREAM
SAUL SENT DAVID WITH AN ARMY TO FIGHT WITH THEM AND JOINING BATTLE WITH THEM HE SLEW MANY OF THEM AND AFTER HIS VICTORY HE RETURNED TO THE KING BUT HIS RECEPTION BY SAUL WAS NOT AS HE EXPECTED UPON SUCH SUCCESS FOR HE WAS GRIEVED AT HIS PROSPERITY
UNLESS HE IN EVERY RESPECT CARRY HIMSELF IN A MANNER AGREEABLE TO US THIS MAN I SAY LAID A PRIVATE DESIGN TO ABUSE THY WIFE AND THIS AT THE TIME OF A FESTIVAL OBSERVING WHEN THOU WOULDST BE ABSENT
HE HAD HIM IN THE GREATEST HONOR AND TAUGHT HIM THE LEARNING THAT BECAME A FREE MAN AND GAVE HIM LEAVE TO MAKE USE OF A DIET BETTER THAN WAS ALLOTTED TO SLAVES HE INTRUSTED ALSO THE CARE OF HIS HOUSE TO HIM SO HE ENJOYED THESE ADVANTAGES
HOWEVER THOU SHALT GAIN SECURITY BY MY MEANS AND SHALT BY NO MEANS SUFFER ANY HARM BUT SEE THOU DOST NOT FORGET WHAT I HAVE DESIRED OF THEE IN THE TIME OF THY PROSPERITY AND BE SERVICEABLE TO MY CHILDREN NOW DAVID
AND TO INQUIRE ONE OF ANOTHER WHAT WERE THE OCCASIONS OF THEIR BEING CONDEMNED TO A PRISON AMONG THEM THE KING'S CUPBEARER AND ONE THAT HAD BEEN RESPECTED BY HIM WAS PUT IN BONDS UPON THE KING'S ANGER AT HIM THIS MAN WAS UNDER THE SAME BONDS WITH JOSEPH
THAT HIS WHEAT SHEAF STOOD STILL IN THE PLACE WHERE HE SET IT BUT THAT THEIR SHEAVES RAN TO BOW DOWN TO IT AS SERVANTS BOW DOWN TO THEIR MASTERS BUT AS SOON AS THEY PERCEIVED THE VISION FORETOLD THAT HE SHOULD OBTAIN POWER AND GREAT WEALTH
YOU THAT ARE MEN OF MY OWN TRIBE I CONCLUDE THAT YOU REMEMBER THE BENEFITS THAT I HAVE BESTOWED UPON YOU AND THAT I HAVE MADE SOME OF YOU OWNERS OF LAND AND MADE YOU COMMANDERS AND BESTOWED POSTS OF HONOR UPON YOU
IF THOU WILT GIVE ME LEAVE I WILL GO THITHER FOR THOU KNOWEST THE GOOD WILL THAT I BEAR HIM AND THEN IT WAS THAT JONATHAN UNDERSTOOD HIS FATHER'S HATRED TO DAVID AND PLAINLY SAW HIS ENTIRE DISPOSITION FOR SAUL COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS ANGER BUT REPROACHED JONATHAN
AFTER HE HAD ENDURED HIS BONDS TWO YEARS AND HAD RECEIVED NO ASSISTANCE FROM THE CUPBEARER WHO DID NOT REMEMBER WHAT HE HAD SAID TO HIM FORMERLY AND GOD CONTRIVED THIS METHOD OF DELIVERANCE FOR HIM PHARAOH THE KING HAD SEEN IN HIS SLEEP THE SAME EVENING TWO VISIONS
AND USED ENTREATIES TO THEM AND THEREBY ENDEAVORED TO DIVERT THEM FROM THE MURDER OF THEIR BROTHER BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT HIS DISCOURSE HAD NOT MOLLIFIED THEM AT ALL AND THAT THEY MADE HASTE TO DO THE FACT
THOU SAYEST THAT THOU DIDST SQUEEZE THIS WINE FROM THREE CLUSTERS OF GRAPES WITH THINE HANDS AND THAT THE KING RECEIVED IT KNOW THEREFORE THAT THIS VISION IS FOR THY GOOD
HE FLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY OF THE HEBREWS INTO THAT OF THE PHILISTINES OVER WHICH ACHISH REIGNED AND WHEN THE KING'S SERVANTS KNEW HIM AND HE WAS MADE KNOWN TO THE KING HIMSELF THE SERVANTS INFORMING HIM THAT HE WAS THAT DAVID WHO HAD KILLED MANY TEN THOUSANDS OF THE PHILISTINES
NOR TO THE CALUMNIES OF THOSE THAT RAISED THOSE REPORTS IF THERE WERE ANY THAT DID SO BUT TO DEPEND ON HIM AND TAKE COURAGE FOR THAT HIS FATHER HAD NO SUCH INTENTION SINCE HE WOULD HAVE ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THAT MATTER AND HAVE TAKEN HIS ADVICE HAD IT BEEN SO
AND FOR PASTURAGE THERE THEY FED THEIR FLOCKS WITHOUT ACQUAINTING THEIR FATHER WITH THEIR REMOVAL THITHER WHEREUPON HE HAD MELANCHOLY SUSPICIONS ABOUT THEM AS BEING IGNORANT OF HIS SONS CONDITION
WERE BY ONE WIFE WHOSE NAME WAS ALIBAMA BUT OF THE REST ALIPHAZ WAS BORN TO HIM BY ADA
AND YIELDED TO REPENTANCE AND AMENDMENT BUT IN CASE THEY PROCEEDED TO DO THE FACT ALL SORTS OF PUNISHMENTS WOULD OVERTAKE THEM FROM GOD FOR THIS MURDER OF THEIR BROTHER SINCE THEY POLLUTED HIS PROVIDENCE WHICH WAS EVERY WHERE PRESENT AND WHICH
HAVING THEIR HEADS BORNE DOWN BY THE WEIGHT OF THE GRAINS AND BENDING DOWN WITH THE FRUIT WHICH WAS NOW RIPE AND FIT FOR REAPING AND NEAR THESE I SAW SEVEN OTHER EARS OF CORN MEAGER AND WEAK FOR WANT OF RAIN WHICH FELL TO EATING AND CONSUMING THOSE THAT WERE FIT FOR REAPING
FOR THAT THE THREE BASKETS SIGNIFY THAT ON THE THIRD DAY HE SHOULD BE CRUCIFIED AND DEVOURED BY FOWLS WHILE HE WAS NOT ABLE TO HELP HIMSELF NOW BOTH THESE DREAMS HAD THE SAME SEVERAL EVENTS THAT JOSEPH FORETOLD THEY SHOULD HAVE AND THIS TO BOTH THE PARTIES
THAT HE MIGHT COME INTO THE JUDGMENT HALL AND SO MIGHT BE DELIVERED UP AND CONDEMNED AND SLAIN
AND CHOSE TO UNDERGO THE SHARPEST PUNISHMENT RATHER THAN TO ENJOY HIS PRESENT ADVANTAGES BY DOING WHAT HIS OWN CONSCIENCE KNEW WOULD JUSTLY DESERVE THAT HE SHOULD DIE FOR IT HE ALSO PUT HER IN MIND THAT SHE WAS A MARRIED WOMAN AND THAT SHE OUGHT TO COHABIT WITH HER HUSBAND ONLY
BOTH REPRESENT IN A CERTAIN MEASURE THE CONFISCATION OF RIGHT AND IN ORDER TO CLEAR AWAY UNIVERSAL INSURRECTION THEY MUST BE COMBATED IT MUST BE DONE FRANCE BEING ALWAYS THE ONE TO BEGIN
BY THE BOULEVARD TRAVERSED THE ESPLANADE AND THE BRIDGE OF THE INVALIDES
WHICH SHE HAD NOT YET DONE UP TO THAT TIME SHE HAD CONTENTED HERSELF WITH WATCHING HIM ON HIS PASSAGE ALONG THE BOULEVARD WITHOUT EVER SEEKING TO ENCOUNTER HIM IT WAS ONLY ON THE EVENING BEFORE THAT SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS HIM
AND HE PUSHED HER ASIDE WITH THE INTENTION OF ENTERING MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER MONTPARNASSE SAID EPONINE I ENTREAT YOU YOU ARE A GOOD FELLOW DON'T ENTER
MAD WITH GRIEF NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING FIXED OR SOLID IN HIS BRAIN INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING ANYTHING THENCEFORTH OF FATE AFTER THOSE TWO MONTHS PASSED IN THE INTOXICATION OF YOUTH AND LOVE
AND SAID GENTLY WELL NO I WON'T APPROACH BUT DON'T SPEAK SO LOUD SO YOU INTEND TO HINDER US IN OUR WORK MY DAUGHTER BUT WE MUST EARN OUR LIVING ALL THE SAME
BLOWS GIVEN AND RECEIVED IN THE REAR IT WAS BECAUSE COMING FROM MARENGO AND FRIEDLAND IT DID NOT WISH TO GO TO THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE IT WAS BECAUSE AFTER WHAT IT HAD DONE WITH THE FATHER IT DID NOT WISH TO DO THIS FOR THE SON
IT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE SCORCHED HIS HANDS AND BURST OUT AFLAME BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE THE SWORD OF THE ANGEL
WAR OF THE STREETS WHY NOT THAT WAS THE WAR OF AMBIORIX OF ARTEVELDE OF MARNIX OF PELAGIUS BUT AMBIORIX FOUGHT AGAINST ROME ARTEVELDE AGAINST FRANCE
OVERWHELMED AT ONCE BY ALL THE REVERIES OF DESPAIR HE HAD BUT ONE DESIRE REMAINING TO MAKE A SPEEDY END OF ALL HE SET OUT AT RAPID PACE HE FOUND HIMSELF MOST OPPORTUNELY ARMED
CLASPING AND THROWING EACH OTHER WHILE EACH ONE HASTENED AND INVITED THE LAST AND DECISIVE HOUR OF THE CRISIS FAR AWAY AND QUITE OUTSIDE OF THIS FATAL QUARTER IN THE MOST PROFOUND DEPTHS OF THE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES OF THAT
CRIED THENARDIER WHEN WE'VE TURNED THE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN AND PUT THE CELLAR AT THE TOP AND THE ATTIC BELOW WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT THERE IS INSIDE AND WHETHER IT'S FRANCS OR SOUS OR HALF FARTHINGS
NONE OF THAT LISETTE SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE UNDERPINNING OF THE RAILING CLOSE BESIDE THE BAR AS THOUGH SHE WERE GUARDING IT IT WAS PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE THE RAILING TOUCHED THE NEIGHBORING WALL THERE WAS A DIM NOOK THERE
THE WHOLE OF THIS ITINERARY
WHEN THE MASTER FALLS IN FRANCE HE FALLS EVERYWHERE IN SHORT WHAT CAUSE IS MORE JUST AND CONSEQUENTLY WHAT WAR IS GREATER THAN THAT WHICH RE ESTABLISHES SOCIAL TRUTH
WRETCHED OLD PARIS WHICH DISAPPEARS UNDER THE SPLENDOR OF HAPPY AND OPULENT PARIS THE SOMBRE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE COULD BE HEARD GIVING UTTERANCE TO A DULL ROAR A FEARFUL AND SACRED VOICE
FOR THE ONE PARTY TO ADVANCE MEANT DEATH AND NO ONE DREAMED OF RETREATING FOR THE OTHER TO REMAIN MEANT DEATH AND NO ONE DREAMED OF FLIGHT IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT ALL SHOULD BE ENDED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
HE HAD THE REPUTATION OF NOT STICKING AT ANYTHING AND IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE HAD PLUNDERED A POLICE POST SIMPLY OUT OF BRAVADO BESIDES THIS HE MADE VERSES AND SONGS WHICH GAVE HIM GREAT AUTHORITY
AFTER DIDEROT DANTON MULTITUDES HAVE A TENDENCY TO ACCEPT THE MASTER THEIR MASS BEARS WITNESS TO APATHY A CROWD IS EASILY LED AS A WHOLE TO OBEDIENCE MEN MUST BE STIRRED UP PUSHED ON
THE TENTH OF AUGUST ELECTRIFIES THEM
WHO WERE A MERE HANDFUL AGAINST AN ARMY SHOULD HE BE UNTRUE AT ONCE TO HIS LOVE TO COUNTRY TO HIS WORD SHOULD HE GIVE TO HIS COWARDICE THE PRETEXT OF PATRIOTISM BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND IF THE PHANTOM OF HIS FATHER WAS THERE IN THE GLOOM
YOU DON'T FRIGHTEN ME I TELL YOU THAT YOU SHAN'T ENTER THIS HOUSE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SUIT ME IF YOU APPROACH I'LL BARK I TOLD YOU I'M THE DOG AND I DON'T CARE A STRAW FOR YOU GO YOUR WAY YOU BORE ME
I HAVE ONLY TO CRY OUT AND PEOPLE WILL COME AND THEN SLAP BANG THERE ARE SIX OF YOU I REPRESENT THE WHOLE WORLD THENARDIER MADE A MOVEMENT TOWARDS HER DON'T APPROACH SHE CRIED HE HALTED
OF WHOM ARE YOU SPEAKING DO YOU CALL LOUIS PHILIPPE THE TYRANT NO
CIVIL WAR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THERE A FOREIGN WAR IS NOT ALL WAR BETWEEN MEN WAR BETWEEN BROTHERS WAR IS QUALIFIED ONLY BY ITS OBJECT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FOREIGN OR CIVIL WAR
THESE MELANCHOLY OPENINGS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE GLOOM BEFORE DESPAIR ARE TEMPTING MARIUS THRUST ASIDE THE BAR WHICH HAD SO OFTEN ALLOWED HIM TO PASS EMERGED FROM THE GARDEN AND SAID I WILL GO
TREATED ROUGHLY BY THE VERY BENEFIT OF THEIR DELIVERANCE THEIR EYES MUST BE WOUNDED BY THE TRUE LIGHT MUST BE HURLED AT THEM IN TERRIBLE HANDFULS
AND TO DEPART IN WRATH INTO THE GLOOM THAT IF IT HAD THUS FLED IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS INTELLIGENT AND BECAUSE IT HAD FORESEEN THE FUTURE THAT IT HAD HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF THIS REBELLION THE WAR OF THE GUTTERS
HAD PRESERVED WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AT THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE ON HIS LEFT HE THRUST HIS HEAD FORWARD AND LOOKED INTO THE FRAGMENT OF THE RUE MONDETOUR
WHICH HAD THE FORM OF A HUGE SPIDER THESE STREETS WERE NOT DESERTED THERE COULD BE DESCRIED PILES OF GUNS MOVING BAYONETS AND TROOPS BIVOUACKING NO CURIOUS OBSERVER PASSED THAT LIMIT THERE CIRCULATION CEASED
THE REALITY OF THE POLITICAL ACTION SUCH AS IT WAS SEEMED CLOSER AND ACQUIRED POIGNANCY BY ANTONIA'S BELIEF IN THE CAUSE ITS CRUDENESS HURT HIS FEELINGS HE WAS SURPRISED AT HIS OWN SENSITIVENESS I SUPPOSE I AM MORE OF A COSTAGUANERO THAN I WOULD HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
AND THOSE WERE THE LAST WORDS IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT COULD EVER HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ANTONIA HE HAD NEVER MADE IT UP WITH HER SO COMPLETELY IN ALL THEIR INTERCOURSE OF SMALL ENCOUNTERS BUT EVEN BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO TURN TOWARDS HIM WHICH SHE DID SLOWLY WITH A RIGID GRACE HE HAD BEGUN TO PLEAD
CHAPTER FOUR HE EXPLAINS HIMSELF GILES TOLLER'S MISERLY NATURE HAD OFFERED TO HIS LODGER SHELTER FROM WIND AND RAIN AND THE FURNITURE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO MAKE A BEDROOM HABITABLE AND NOTHING MORE
THE PRECONCEIVED VIEWS OF HIS EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION
BUT HIS THREATENING ME IN THIS MANNER WAS SO ABSURD THAT I GAVE WAY TO THE IMPRESSION OF THE MOMENT AND LAUGHED HE STEPPED UP TO ME WITH SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF DEMONIACAL RAGE AND HATRED IN HIS FACE THAT HE BECAME ABSOLUTELY UGLY IN AN INSTANT I AMUSE YOU DO I HE SAID YOU DON'T KNOW THE MAN YOU'RE TRIFLING WITH
THERE IS A CERTAIN CONVENT WALL ROUND THE CORNER OF THE PLAZA OPPOSITE THE DOOR OF THE BULL RING YOU KNOW OPPOSITE THE DOOR WITH THE INSCRIPTION INTRADA DE LA SOMBRA APPROPRIATE PERHAPS THAT'S WHERE THE UNCLE OF OUR HOST GAVE UP HIS ANGLO SOUTH AMERICAN SOUL AND NOTE HE MIGHT HAVE RUN AWAY
EVEN HE THIS IS SHEER CALUMNY SAID ANTONIA NOT VERY SEVERELY
AS WHEN DIRECTING A DEBATE FROM A HIGH TRIBUNE THOUGH THEY ALL RAISED THEIR EYES ANTONIA DID NOT MAKE THE USUAL GREETING GESTURE OF A FLUTTERED HAND AND THEY AFFECTED NOT TO SEE THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE COSTAGUANEROS WITH EUROPEAN MANNERS WHOSE ECCENTRICITIES WERE DISCUSSED BEHIND THE BARRED WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FAMILIES IN SULACO
THEY EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS OF WHICH ONLY THE PHRASE THE GREATEST ENTHUSIASM PRONOUNCED BY MISSUS GOULD COULD BE HEARD
WHEN YOU MAKE WAR YOU MAY RETREAT BUT NOT WHEN YOU SPEND YOUR TIME IN INCITING POOR IGNORANT FOOLS TO KILL AND TO DIE HIS TONE REMAINED LIGHT AND AS IF UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE SHE STOOD MOTIONLESS HER HANDS CLASPED LIGHTLY THE FAN HANGING DOWN FROM HER INTERLACED FINGERS
THEY LOOKED AT ME WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SAD AND SOLEMN WARNING DISCOVER FOR YOURSELF HE SAID WHAT DEVILS MY DEAFNESS HAS SET LOOSE IN ME AND LET NO EYES BUT YOURS SEE THAT HORRID SIGHT YOU WILL FIND ME HERE TOMORROW AND YOU WILL DECIDE BY THAT TIME WHETHER YOU MAKE AN ENEMY OF ME OR NOT
MY MASTER WAS THE GUARDED ANSWER THAT THIS ODD SERVANT RETURNED
IF HE IS SUCCESSFUL SAID ANTONIA THOUGHTFULLY YOU SEEM SATISFIED TO SEE MY LIFE HANG ON A THREAD DECOUD REPLIED WITH A BROAD SMILE AND THE OTHER MONTERO THE MY TRUSTED BROTHER OF THE PROCLAMATIONS THE GUERRILLERO
DON JOSE HAD RAISED HIS VOICE HE RUBBED HIS HANDS CHEERILY
HER BLUE EYES GLIDED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM SLIGHTLY UPWARDS MOLLIFIED AND QUESTIONING YOU CAN'T THINK I AM SERIOUS WHEN I CALL MONTERO A GRAN BESTIA EVERY SECOND DAY IN THE PORVENIR THAT IS NOT A SERIOUS OCCUPATION NO OCCUPATION IS SERIOUS NOT EVEN WHEN A BULLET THROUGH THE HEART IS THE PENALTY OF FAILURE
THE WINDOW WAS THROWN OPEN AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE THICKNESS OF THE WALL THE LONG FOLDS OF THE DAMASK CURTAIN FALLING STRAIGHT FROM THE BROAD BRASS CORNICE HID HIM PARTLY FROM THE ROOM HE FOLDED HIS ARMS ON HIS BREAST AND LOOKED STEADILY AT ANTONIA'S PROFILE
THIS ASSERTION OF MY WILL AGAINST HIS ROUSED HIM HE STOPPED ME AT THE DOOR NOT BY A MOTION OF HIS HAND BUT BY THE MASTERY OF HIS LOOK THE DIM CANDLELIGHT AFFORDED ME NO HELP IN DETERMINING THE COLOR OF HIS EYES DARK LARGE AND FINELY SET IN HIS HEAD
I HAVE ONLY ONE AIM IN THE WORLD SHE MADE AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE NEGATIVE MOVEMENT OF HER HEAD STILL STARING ACROSS THE STREET AT THE AVELLANOS'S HOUSE GREY MARKED WITH DECAY AND WITH IRON BARS LIKE A PRISON
HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MINUTE STARTLED AS IF OVERWHELMED BY A SORT OF AWED HAPPINESS WITH THE LINES OF THE MOCKING SMILE STILL STIFFENED ABOUT HIS MOUTH AND INCREDULOUS SURPRISE IN HIS EYES THE VALUE OF A SENTENCE IS IN THE PERSONALITY WHICH UTTERS IT FOR NOTHING NEW CAN BE SAID BY MAN OR WOMAN
HAVEN'T I WRITTEN THAT HE WAS TAKING THE GUESTS OVERCOATS AND CHANGING PLATES IN PARIS AT OUR LEGATION IN THE INTERVALS OF SPYING ON OUR REFUGEES THERE IN THE TIME OF ROJAS HE WILL WASH OUT THAT SACRED TRUTH IN BLOOD IN MY BLOOD WHY DO YOU LOOK ANNOYED
I WROTE MY REPLY THE PLACE MAKES ME SORRY FOR YOU HE SHOOK HIS HEAD YOUR SYMPATHY IS THROWN AWAY ON ME A MAN WHO HAS LOST HIS SOCIAL RELATIONS WITH HIS FELLOW CREATURES DOESN'T CARE HOW HE LODGES OR WHERE HE LIVES WHEN HE HAS FOUND SOLITUDE HE HAS FOUND ALL HE WANTS FOR THE REST OF HIS DAYS
SHE TOO AFFECTED NOT TO SEE THE SENOR DECOUD TALKING PUBLICLY WITH ANTONIA IN DEFIANCE OF EVERY CONVENTION AND HE NOT EVEN HER NOVIO AS FAR AS THE WORLD KNEW THOUGH EVEN IN THAT CASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SCANDAL ENOUGH BUT THE DIGNIFIED OLD LADY RESPECTED AND ADMIRED BY THE FIRST FAMILIES
THE NEXT SLIP OF PAPER THAT I HANDED TO HIM ADMINISTERED THE SMARTEST REBUFF THAT MY DULL BRAINS COULD DISCOVER ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT THE CUR IS REQUESTED TO KEEP HIS ADVICE TILL HE IS ASKED FOR IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING LIKE A SMILE SHOWED ITSELF FAINTLY ON HIS LIPS
INSTEAD OF RESENTING THIS UNCIVIL LANGUAGE HE INDIRECTLY REPROVED ME BY BECOMING MORE RESPECTFUL THAN EVER MY MISTRESS DESIRES ME TO TELL YOU SIR THAT LUNCHEON IS WAITING I WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF A THOROUGHBRED ENGLISH SERVANT
HE WAS THINKING OF THE ANGRY FACE OF ANTONIA HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS PEACE WITH HER HE HAD NOT STAYED IN SULACO TO QUARREL WITH ANTONIA MARTIN DECOUD WAS ANGRY WITH HIMSELF ALL HE SAW AND HEARD GOING ON AROUND HIM EXASPERATED
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SLIGHTLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE SHE MURMURED HE WANTED THE WHOLE LOT WHAT SHE WAS FACING HIM NOW IN THE DEEP RECESS OF THE WINDOW VERY CLOSE AND MOTIONLESS HER LIPS MOVED RAPIDLY
AT ANY RATE HE SAID CHANGING SUDDENLY TO A TONE OF BITTER LEVITY YOU WOULD HAVE SENT ME TO STAB HIM WITHOUT COMPUNCTION
THE SQUAT TURRETED SIDES HELD UP BETWEEN THEM A MASS OF MASONRY WITH BUNCHES OF GRASS GROWING AT THE TOP
A JINGLE OF SPURS DIED OUT AT THE FURTHER END
AND IT WOULD BE SO EASY OF ATTAINMENT HE CONTINUED THIS AIM WHICH WHETHER KNOWINGLY OR NOT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD IN MY HEART EVER SINCE THE DAY WHEN YOU SNUBBED ME SO HORRIBLY ONCE IN PARIS YOU REMEMBER A SLIGHT SMILE SEEMED TO MOVE THE CORNER OF THE LIP THAT WAS ON HIS SIDE

A KING THESE BROUGHT US INTO THIS VERY LAND WHICH YOU NOW POSSESS AND WHEN YOU ENJOYED THESE ADVANTAGES FROM GOD YOU BETRAYED HIS WORSHIP AND RELIGION NAY MOREOVER
AND WILL MAKE IT VISIBLE TO YOU NOW AS SOON AS HE HAD SAID THIS GOD GAVE SUCH GREAT SIGNALS BY THUNDER AND LIGHTNING AND THE DESCENT OF HAIL
SO THEY FELL UPON THEM AS THEY WERE ASLEEP AND SLEW ABOUT TWENTY OF THEM AND THEREBY FILLED THEM WITH DISORDER AND SURPRISE INSOMUCH THAT SOME OF THEM THREW AWAY THEIR ENTIRE ARMOR AND FLED BUT THE GREATEST PART
THEY WERE UNDER A GREAT CONSTERNATION AND SOME OF THEM HID THEMSELVES IN CAVES AND IN DENS UNDER GROUND BUT THE GREATER PART FLED INTO THE LAND BEYOND JORDAN
JONATHAN MADE USE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S ASSISTANCE AND DESCENDED FROM THE HILL AND WENT TO THEIR ENEMIES NOW THE ENEMY'S CAMP WAS UPON A PRECIPICE WHICH HAD THREE TOPS
AND THAT IN THE VERY SAME MANNER AS IF I WERE TO PUNISH A STRANGER AND ONE NOT AT ALL RELATED TO ME FOR THE SAME OFFENSE SO WHEN THE MULTITUDE CRIED OUT TO HIM SO TO DO HE PRESENTLY SET ALL THE REST ON ONE SIDE
LAY SOME ONE SUCH CRIME TO MY CHARGE NOW WE ARE IN YOUR KING'S PRESENCE BUT THEY CRIED OUT THAT NO SUCH THING HAD BEEN DONE BY HIM
OR WERE TAKEN BY HIM IN WAR AND THIS HE DID THAT WHEN THEIR LEFT EYES WERE COVERED BY THEIR SHIELDS THEY MIGHT BE WHOLLY USELESS IN WAR NOW WHEN THE KING OF THE AMMONITES HAD SERVED THOSE BEYOND JORDAN IN THIS MANNER
IF THEY HAD ANY DESIRE OF BEING PRESERVED AND MADE HAPPY WITH THEIR KING BUT HE SAID THAT IF THEY SHOULD GROW CARELESS OF THESE THINGS GREAT JUDGMENTS WOULD COME FROM GOD UPON THEM AND UPON THEIR KING
WHEN YOU WERE BROUGHT UNDER THE HANDS OF YOUR ENEMIES HE DELIVERED YOU FIRST BY RENDERING YOU SUPERIOR TO THE ASSYRIANS AND THEIR FORCES HE THEN MADE YOU TO OVERCOME THE AMMONITES AND THE MOABITES AND LAST OF ALL THE PHILISTINES
PERSONS SO FORTUNATE ARE NOT THEN ABLE TO USE THEIR REASON CONSISTENTLY AS HE WAS DESIROUS TO AVENGE HIMSELF AND TO EXACT A DUE PUNISHMENT OF THE PHILISTINES
THEY NOW CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND HONORED HIM AND ESTEEMED HIM AS THE BEST OF MEN FOR HE DID NOT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH HAVING SAVED THE INHABITANTS OF JABESH ONLY BUT HE MADE AN EXPEDITION INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE AMMONITES
THAT GOD HIMSELF UPON THE PRAYERS OF OUR FATHERS SENT MOSES AND AARON WHO WERE BRETHREN AND GAVE THEM POWER TO DELIVER THE MULTITUDE OUT OF THEIR DISTRESS AND THIS WITHOUT
DIMINISHING THEIR FORCES AND DESPISING THEM AS NOT VERY CONSIDERABLE AND AS NOT SO GREAT BUT THEY MIGHT HAZARD A BATTLE WITH THEM BUT WHEN THE PEOPLE ABOUT SAUL OBSERVED HOW NUMEROUS THE PHILISTINES WERE
ON CONDITION TO HAVE THEIR RIGHT EYES PLUCKED OUT OR TO UNDERGO A SIEGE AND TO HAVE THEIR CITIES OVERTHROWN HE GAVE THEM THEIR CHOICE WHETHER THEY WOULD CUT OFF A SMALL MEMBER OF THEIR BODY OR UNIVERSALLY PERISH
THEY HAD SLAIN MANY TEN THOUSANDS OF THE PHILISTINES THEY FELL UPON SPOILING THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES BUT NOT TILL LATE IN THE EVENING THEY ALSO TOOK A GREAT DEAL OF PREY AND CATTLE AND KILLED THEM AND ATE THEM WITH THEIR BLOOD
THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF THE HEBREWS THAT CAME UP AND SO THEY FOUGHT ONE AGAINST ANOTHER AND SOME OF THEM DIED IN THE BATTLE AND SOME AS THEY WERE FLYING AWAY
BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY THAT HERE AROSE FROM THE SITUATION OF THE PLACE AND BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT ALTOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE NOT ONLY TO ASCEND UP TO THE CAMP ON THAT QUARTER BUT SO MUCH AS TO COME NEAR IT AS SOON THEREFORE
AND SENT AWAY THE AMBASSADORS FROM THE INHABITANTS OF JABESH AND PROMISED THEM TO COME TO THEIR ASSISTANCE ON THE THIRD DAY AND TO BEAT THEIR ENEMIES BEFORE SUN RISING THAT THE SUN UPON ITS RISING MIGHT SEE THAT THEY HAD ALREADY CONQUERED
THEN HE INQUIRED WHETHER ANY BODY WAS GONE AWAY FROM THE ARMY AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT HIS SON AND WITH HIM HIS ARMOR BEARER WERE ABSENT HE BADE THE HIGH PRIEST TAKE THE GARMENTS OF HIS HIGH PRIESTHOOD
THE REPORT BEING GONE ABROAD THAT THEY WERE COMING DOWN UPON HIM OF GILGAL TO WHICH SAMUEL REPLIED
AND LAID IT ALL WASTE AND TOOK A LARGE PREY AND SO RETURNED TO HIS OWN COUNTRY MOST GLORIOUSLY SO THE PEOPLE WERE GREATLY PLEASED AT THESE EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES OF SAUL AND REJOICED THAT THEY HAD CONSTITUTED HIM THEIR KING
BECAUSE HAD THEY TAKEN SOME FOOD THEY HAD PURSUED THE ENEMY WITH GREATER RIGOR AND ALACRITY AND HAD BOTH TAKEN AND SLAIN
THAT YOU WILL NOT SPEAK WHAT YOU SAY TO GRATIFY ME
UPON HEARING THAT SAUL WAS GAINING A VICTORY CAME RUNNING TO HIM WHEN THEREFORE THE NUMBER OF THE HEBREWS THAT CAME TO SAUL AMOUNTED TO ABOUT TEN THOUSAND HE PURSUED THE ENEMY WHO WERE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
AND THAT IT WAS MORE AGREEABLE TO BE MEN OF A FRIENDLY DISPOSITION
AND THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED UNDER THE CONDUCT OF JEPHTHA AND GIDEON WHAT MADNESS THEREFORE POSSESSED YOU TO FLY FROM GOD
WHO SAID THAT THEY SHOULD GET THE VICTORY AND PREVAIL AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES SO HE WENT OUT AFTER THE PHILISTINES AND SET UPON THEM AS THEY WERE SLAYING ONE ANOTHER THOSE ALSO WHO HAD FLED TO DENS AND CAVES
AND AGAINST WHOMSOEVER HE MADE WAR HE RETURNED CONQUEROR AND ADVANCED THE AFFAIRS OF THE HEBREWS TO A GREAT DEGREE OF SUCCESS AND PROSPERITY AND MADE THEM SUPERIOR TO OTHER NATIONS
HOW THE PHILISTINES MADE ANOTHER EXPEDITION AGAINST THE HEBREWS
THIS WAS TOLD TO THE KING BY THE SCRIBES THAT THE MULTITUDE WERE SINNING AGAINST GOD AS THEY SACRIFICED AND WERE EATING BEFORE THE BLOOD WAS WELL WASHED AWAY AND THE FLESH WAS MADE CLEAN THEN DID SAUL GIVE ORDER THAT A GREAT STONE SHOULD BE ROLLED INTO THE MIDST OF THEM
LOUIS CONCLUDED ON THE THIRTY FIRST OF MARCH FIFTEEN O FOUR A TRUCE FOR THREE YEARS WITH THE KING OF SPAIN

I NEVER IMAGINED I WAS ENTERING ALL ALONE AND THOUGHT SURELY I WAS BEING FOLLOWED OF MY COMRADES WHO KNEW MORE ABOUT WAR THAN I FOR IF THEY HAD DONE AS I DID THEY WOULD LIKE ME BE PRISONERS
HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING AT THE MOMENT HE PROMISED HE HAS BORNE UPON HIS SHOULDERS THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THIS AFFAIR AND I TELL YOU HE ADDED WITH A FIXED LOOK AT THOSE WHOM HE WAS ADDRESSING THAT HIS ARMY IS A LARGE ONE WHICH HE WILL KEEP UP AND AUGMENT EVERY DAY
GONZALVO WHO WAS KEPT WELL INFORMED OF HIS ENEMIES CONDITION THREW ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF DECEMBER A BRIDGE OVER THE GARIGLIANO
THE COMMAND DEVOLVED UPON THE MARQUIS OF MANTUA WHO MARCHED ON GAETA
WHO SAID NO MORE THAN WELCOME LORD NEXT DAY APRIL ELEVENTH
OF THE NOBLEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THIS GENEROUS ADVICE WAS ACCEPTED BY THE FATHERS AND CARRIED OUT BY THE SONS WITH THAT EARNEST PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE ARDOR WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE RESOLUTION OF GREAT SOULS
CAPUA AND AVERSA FOLLOWED ITS EXAMPLE GAETA WAS THE ONLY IMPORTANT PLACE WHICH STILL HELD OUT FOR THE FRENCH AND CONTAINED A GARRISON CAPABLE OF DEFENDING IT AND THITHER THE REMNANT OF THE TROOPS BEATEN AT SEMINARA AND AT CERIGNOLA
MY OPINION IS THAT YOU MY LORD OUGHT TO SEND BACK TO THE EMPEROR A REPLY OF THIS SORT THAT YOU HAVE HAD A MEETING OF YOUR CAPTAINS WHO ARE QUITE DETERMINED TO DO HIS BIDDING ACCORDING TO THE CHARGE THEY HAVE FROM THE KING THEIR MASTER
WENT THITHER TO LOOK AND HE MARVELLED AND THOUGHT IT GREAT SHAME TO HIM WITH THE NUMBER OF MEN HE HAD THAT HE HAD NOT SOONER DELIVERED THE ASSAULT ON RETURNING TO HIS QUARTERS HE SENT FOR A FRENCH SECRETARY OF HIS WHOM HE BADE WRITE TO THE LORD OF LA PALISSE A LETTER
AND ORDERED ITS COMMANDANTS TO EVACUATE SUCH PLACES AS THEY STILL HELD NEARLY ALL SUCH SUBMITTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE TO THE VICTOR OF AGNADELLO AND HIS ALLIES OF CAMBRAI BUT AT TREVISO WHEN EMPEROR MAXIMILIAN'S COMMISSIONER PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER TO TAKE POSSESSION OF IT
AT THE FIRST RUMOR OF THIS NEWS GONZALVO OF CORDOVA WHETHER SINCERELY OR NOT
AND BARRING MY DUTY TO THE KING MY MASTER AND SAVING MY HONOR I WOULD SHOW MY GRATITUDE FOR IT IN WHATSOEVER IT MIGHT PLEASE YOU TO COMMAND ME IN GOOD FAITH SAID LORD LUDOVICO YOU SHALL HAVE PRESENTLY THAT WHICH YOU DO ASK FOR
AND TESTIFYING GREAT GOOD WILL AND THE SPECIAL COURIER WHO BROUGHT IT DECLARED THAT THE KING HAD WRITTEN TO NOBODY IN ITALY EXCEPT THE POPE THE VENETIANS AND THE FLORENTINES THE VENETIANS DID NOT CARE TO NEGLECT SUCH AN OPENING
HAD BY HIS SAGACITY AND FERTILE MIND BY HIS TASTE FOR ARTS AND SCIENCES AND THE INTELLIGENT PATRONAGE HE BESTOWED UPON THEM BY HIS ABILITY IN SPEAKING AND BY HIS FACILE CHARACTER OBTAINED IN ITALY A POSITION FAR BEYOND HIS REAL POWER
LA PALISSE FELL IN WITH THE GOOD KNIGHT BAYARD TO WHOM HE SAID MY COMRADE MY FRIEND WOULD YOU NOT LIKE US TO BE COMRADES TOGETHER BAYARD WHO ASKED NOTHING BETTER ANSWERED HIM GRACIOUSLY THAT HE WAS AT HIS SERVICE TO BE DISPOSED OF AT HIS PLEASURE
WERE AS LITTLE TO BE DEPENDED UPON IN THE FUTURE AS THEY WERE COMPROMISING AT THE PRESENT BY REASON OF THEIR REPUTATION FOR UNBRIDLED AMBITION PERFIDY AND CRIME THE KING OF FRANCE WHATEVER SACRIFICES HE MIGHT ALREADY HAVE MADE AND MIGHT STILL MAKE IN ORDER TO INSURE THEIR CO OPERATION COULD NO MORE COUNT UPON IT
THE TITLES OF KING OF NAPLES AND OF JERUSALEM AND DUKE OF MILAN
I DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE MANY WHO WILL NOT BE OBEDIENT TO THAT WHICH THE EMPEROR SHALL BE PLEASED TO COMMAND
WHEREFORE MY LORDS SAID THE EMPEROR I PRAY YOU AS MUCH AS EVER I CAN TO BE PLEASED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND SET YOURSELVES AFOOT WITH THEM AND I HOPE WITH GOD'S HELP THAT AT THE FIRST ASSAULT WE SHALL BE MASTERS OF OUR ENEMIES WHEN THE EMPEROR HAD DONE SPEAKING
I HAVE A GOOD MIND THAT THE KING OF FRANCE'S ARMY AND MINE SHOULD COME TOGETHER IN ORDER THAT BY BATTLE IT MAY BE KNOWN TO WHOM OF RIGHT BELONGS THIS HERITAGE FOR I SEE NO OTHER WAY TO IT BY MY SACRED OATH MY LORD SAID THE GOOD KNIGHT I WOULD THAT IT MIGHT BE TO MORROW PROVIDED THAT I WERE OUT OF CAPTIVITY
ALL THE OTHER PLACES WERE GIVEN UP BY TRAITORS OR SURRENDERED WITHOUT A SHOW OF RESISTANCE THE VENETIANS HAD THE SAME SUCCESS ON THE EASTERN FRONTIER OF THE DUCHY MILAN AND CREMONA ALONE REMAINED TO BE OCCUPIED LUDOVIC SFORZA
AND WHEN THE HOLY SEE SUDDENLY BECAME ONCE MORE VACANT
IN ONE OF THE FIGHTS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THIS SUDDEN REVOLUTION THE YOUNG CHEVALIER BAYARD CARRIED AWAY BY THE IMPETUOSITY OF HIS AGE AND COURAGE PURSUED RIGHT INTO MILAN THE FOES HE WAS DRIVING BEFORE HIM WITHOUT NOTICING
AND PROVISIONED IT WELL AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE FIFTEENTH OF SEPTEMBER THAT HE SAT DOWN BEFORE THE PLACE ALL THE ALLIES OF THE LEAGUE OF CAMBRAI HELD THEMSELVES BOUND TO FURNISH HIM WITH THEIR CONTINGENT ON SALLYING FROM MILAN FOR THIS CAMPAIGN
WHEREAT HE WAS RIGHT JOYOUS AND HAD BONFIRES LIGHTED TOGETHER WITH DEVOTIONAL PROCESSIONS GIVING THANKS TO THE PRINCE OF PRINCES FOR THE HAPPY VICTORY HE HAD BY THE DIVINE AID OBTAINED OVER HIS ENEMIES
APPEARED BEFORE HIS TROOPS AND HIS PEOPLE LIKE THE VERY SPIRIT OF LETHARGY SAYS A CONTEMPORARY UNPUBLISHED CHRONICLE WITH HIS HEAD BENT DOWN TO THE EARTH AND FOR A LONG WHILE HE REMAINED THUS PENSIVE AND WITHOUT A SINGLE WORD TO SAY
LOUIS ON HIS SIDE SHOWED ANXIETY AS TO THE CONDUCT WHICH WOULD BE EXHIBITED TOWARDS HIM BY THE VENETIANS IF HE ENCOUNTERED ANY EMBARRASSMENT IN HIS EXPEDITION TO NAPLES
WOULD SUCCEED HIM AND THAT HOPE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH THE SHOCKING FAVOR HE SHOWED CAESAR BORGIA THAT INFAMOUS SON OF A DEMORALIZED FATHER
AND IN SHORT EVERYTHING IN READINESS TO DECAMP NEXT MORNING AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE JUST AS HE LEFT MILAN HE SAID TO THE VENETIAN AMBASSADORS YOU HAVE BROUGHT THE KING OF FRANCE TO DINNER WITH ME
WITH THE HOPE THAT THE KING'S MINISTER WOULD BECOME THE HEAD OF CHRISTENDOM WHEN ONCE HE WAS HIMSELF IN POSSESSION OF THIS PUISSANT TITLE HE SHOWED HIMSELF AS HE REALLY WAS AMBITIOUS AUDACIOUS IMPERIOUS ENERGETIC STUBBORN AND COMBINING THE EGOTISM OF THE ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGN
HOWBEIT HE WAS NOT SO DISCOMFITED BUT THAT ON THAT VERY SAME DAY HE COULD GET HIS LUGGAGE PACKED HIS TRANSPORT TRAIN UNDER ORDERS HIS HORSES SHOD HIS DUCATS WITH WHICH HE HAD MORE THAN THIRTY MULES LADEN PUT BY
THE SPOIL THEY SHOULD GET FROM HIM CAPUA CAPITULATED AND WAS NEVERTHELESS PLUNDERED AND LAID WASTE A FRENCH FLEET COMMANDED BY PHILIP DE RAVENSTEIN ARRIVED OFF NAPLES WHEN D'AUBIGNY WAS ALREADY MASTER OF IT
ONE HISTORIAN SAYS THAT AN EVENT WAS PRODUCED BY NAPOLEON'S POWER ANOTHER THAT IT WAS PRODUCED BY ALEXANDER'S
BUT CONTRADICT THEMSELVES PEASANTS HAVING NO CLEAR IDEA OF THE CAUSE OF RAIN SAY ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY WANT RAIN OR FINE WEATHER THE WIND HAS BLOWN THE CLOUDS AWAY OR THE WIND HAS BROUGHT UP THE CLOUDS
BECAUSE ON THAT FACE WHOSE EYES HAD ALWAYS SHONE WITH A SUPPRESSED SMILE OF THE JOY OF LIFE NOW WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED AND GLANCED AT HER THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SHADOW OF A SMILE ONLY HER EYES WERE KINDLY ATTENTIVE AND SADLY INTERROGATIVE
A MAN WHO HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE POST WHEN DRON DIED AND WHO WAS ACCUSED OF DISHONESTY AND VARIOUS IRREGULARITIES NICHOLAS WENT OUT INTO THE PORCH TO QUESTION HIM AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ELDER HAD GIVEN A FEW REPLIES THE SOUND OF CRIES AND BLOWS WERE HEARD
AND HAD GROWN QUITE RECONCILED TO HER LOT AS A STERILE FLOWER SHE SEEMED TO BE FOND NOT SO MUCH OF INDIVIDUALS AS OF THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE LIKE A CAT SHE HAD ATTACHED HERSELF NOT TO THE PEOPLE BUT TO THE HOME
BUT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE SUBMISSION OF MILLIONS AND THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN HOW FROM THESE RELATIONS OF THEIRS THE SUBMISSION OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE RESULTED THAT IS HOW COMPONENT FORCES EQUAL TO ONE A GAVE A RESULTANT EQUAL TO A THOUSAND TIMES A
AND WOULD HE MIND TAKING A PARCEL FOR SOMEONE HE REPLIED YES PERHAPS OR I THINK SO AND SO ON HE HAD HEARD THAT THE ROSTOVS WERE AT KOSTROMA BUT THE THOUGHT OF NATASHA SELDOM OCCURRED TO HIM
JUST AS SUCH A CONNECTION MAY BE FOUND BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF HUMANITY AND COMMERCE HANDICRAFT GARDENING OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU PLEASE
I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOR IT SHAN'T OCCUR AGAIN AND LET THIS ALWAYS BE A REMINDER TO ME AND HE POINTED TO THE BROKEN RING AFTER THAT WHEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS VILLAGE ELDERS OR STEWARDS THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS FACE AND HIS FISTS BEGAN TO CLENCH
THE BUILDINGS BEGUN UNDER STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES WERE MORE THAN SIMPLE THE IMMENSE HOUSE ON THE OLD STONE FOUNDATIONS WAS OF WOOD PLASTERED ONLY INSIDE IT HAD BARE DEAL FLOORS AND WAS FURNISHED WITH VERY SIMPLE HARD SOFAS ARMCHAIRS TABLES AND CHAIRS
AT FIRST HE SAW NOTHING REPREHENSIBLE IN THIS BUT IN THE SECOND YEAR OF HIS MARRIAGE HIS VIEW OF THAT FORM OF PUNISHMENT SUDDENLY CHANGED ONCE IN SUMMER HE HAD SENT FOR THE VILLAGE ELDER FROM BOGUCHAROVO
THIS CONTRADICTION OCCURS BECAUSE AFTER ENTERING THE FIELD OF ANALYSIS THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS STOP HALFWAY TO FIND COMPONENT FORCES EQUAL TO THE COMPOSITE OR RESULTANT FORCE THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS MUST EQUAL THE RESULTANT
SPECIALIST HISTORIANS DESCRIBING THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN OR THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS PLAINLY ASSERT THAT THESE EVENTS WERE PRODUCED BY THE WILL OF ALEXANDER BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIAN GERVINUS REFUTING THIS OPINION OF THE SPECIALIST HISTORIAN
A THIRD CLASS OF HISTORIANS THE SO CALLED HISTORIANS OF CULTURE FOLLOWING THE PATH LAID DOWN BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS WHO SOMETIMES ACCEPT WRITERS AND LADIES AS FORCES PRODUCING EVENTS AGAIN TAKE THAT FORCE TO BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
NICHOLAS WOULD TURN THE BROKEN RING ON HIS FINGER AND WOULD DROP HIS EYES BEFORE THE MAN WHO WAS MAKING HIM ANGRY BUT HE DID FORGET HIMSELF ONCE OR TWICE WITHIN A TWELVEMONTH AND THEN HE WOULD GO AND CONFESS TO HIS WIFE AND WOULD AGAIN PROMISE THAT THIS SHOULD REALLY BE THE VERY LAST TIME
MADE BY THEIR OWN SERF CARPENTERS OUT OF THEIR OWN BIRCHWOOD THE HOUSE WAS SPACIOUS AND HAD ROOMS FOR THE HOUSE SERFS AND APARTMENTS FOR VISITORS WHOLE FAMILIES OF THE ROSTOVS AND BOLKONSKIS RELATIONS SOMETIMES CAME TO BALD HILLS WITH SIXTEEN HORSES AND DOZENS OF SERVANTS AND STAYED FOR MONTHS
AT THAT MOMENT PIERRE INVOLUNTARILY BETRAYED TO HER TO PRINCESS MARY AND ABOVE ALL TO HIMSELF A SECRET OF WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN UNAWARE HE FLUSHED JOYFULLY YET WITH PAINFUL DISTRESS HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS AGITATION BUT THE MORE HE TRIED TO HIDE IT THE MORE CLEARLY
ARE SIGNIFICANT FROM THE FACT THAT AFTER SERIOUSLY AND MINUTELY EXAMINING
FOR THAT VIEW IS NOT CONFIRMED BY SUCH FACTS AS THE VERY CRUEL MURDERS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION RESULTING FROM THE DOCTRINE OF THE EQUALITY OF MAN OR THE VERY CRUEL WARS AND EXECUTIONS RESULTING FROM THE PREACHING OF LOVE BUT EVEN ADMITTING AS CORRECT
HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING FRENCHMEN BEGIN TO DROWN ONE ANOTHER CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSAL NEXUS OF THIS NEW FORCE WITH THE EVENT UNDOUBTEDLY SOME RELATION EXISTS BETWEEN ALL WHO LIVE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY
TO HIM THAT HATH SHALL BE GIVEN AND FROM HIM THAT HATH NOT SHALL BE TAKEN AWAY YOU REMEMBER SHE IS ONE THAT HATH NOT WHY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS SHE LACKS EGOTISM I DON'T KNOW BUT FROM HER IS TAKEN AWAY AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY
SUCH AN INSOLENT SCOUNDREL HE CRIED GROWING HOT AGAIN AT THE MERE RECOLLECTION OF HIM IF HE HAD TOLD ME HE WAS DRUNK AND DID NOT SEE BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU MARY HE SUDDENLY ASKED
SHE AGAIN GLANCED RAPIDLY FROM PIERRE'S FACE TO THAT OF THE LADY IN THE BLACK DRESS AND SAID DO YOU REALLY NOT RECOGNIZE HER PIERRE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE COMPANION'S PALE DELICATE FACE WITH ITS BLACK EYES AND PECULIAR MOUTH AND SOMETHING NEAR TO HIM LONG FORGOTTEN AND MORE THAN SWEET
THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE INVOLUNTARILY CONTRADICT THEMSELVES AND SHOW THAT THE NEW FORCE THEY HAVE DEVISED DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN HISTORY
THAT PRINCESS MARY WAS IN MOSCOW THE DEATH SUFFERINGS AND LAST DAYS OF PRINCE ANDREW HAD OFTEN OCCUPIED PIERRE'S THOUGHTS AND NOW RECURRED TO HIM WITH FRESH VIVIDNESS HAVING HEARD AT DINNER THAT PRINCESS MARY WAS IN MOSCOW AND LIVING IN HER HOUSE
HE SPOKE OF YOU EVEN AT THE VERY LAST SHE WENT ON TURNING HER EYES FROM PIERRE TO HER COMPANION WITH A SHYNESS THAT SURPRISED HIM FOR AN INSTANT I WAS SO GLAD TO HEAR OF YOUR SAFETY IT WAS THE FIRST PIECE OF GOOD NEWS WE HAD RECEIVED FOR A LONG TIME
WHICH HAD NOT BEEN BURNED IN VOZDVIZHENKA STREET HE DROVE THAT SAME EVENING TO SEE HER ON HIS WAY TO THE HOUSE PIERRE KEPT THINKING OF PRINCE ANDREW OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP OF HIS VARIOUS MEETINGS WITH HIM AND ESPECIALLY OF THE LAST ONE AT BORODINO
ON RETURNING TO LUNCH NICHOLAS WENT UP TO HIS WIFE WHO SAT WITH HER HEAD BENT LOW OVER HER EMBROIDERY FRAME AND AS USUAL BEGAN TO TELL HER WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING THAT MORNING AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SPOKE OF THE BOGUCHAROVO ELDER COUNTESS MARY TURNED RED AND THEN PALE
FICHTE CHATEAUBRIAND AND OTHERS THE HISTORIAN EVIDENTLY DECOMPOSES ALEXANDER'S POWER INTO THE COMPONENTS TALLEYRAND CHATEAUBRIAND AND THE REST BUT THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS THAT IS THE INTERACTIONS OF CHATEAUBRIAND
AND BEGAN WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PAVEMENT GOING AND COMING IN PERFECT PEACE OF MIND AT MOMENTS
CAMILLE WAS HIDEOUS HE HAD BEEN A FORTNIGHT IN THE WATER HIS FACE STILL APPEARED FIRM AND RIGID THE FEATURES WERE PRESERVED BUT THE SKIN HAD TAKEN A YELLOWISH MUDDY TINT
AND TOLD HIM HE HAD JUST RECOGNIZED CAMILLE LYING ON ONE OF THE SLABS IN THE MORGUE THE FORMALITIES WERE PERFORMED THE DROWNED MAN WAS BURIED AND A CERTIFICATE OF DEATH DELIVERED
IT HAD SHRUNK UP IN ITS DECAY AND THE HEAP IT FORMED WAS QUITE SMALL ANYONE MIGHT HAVE GUESSED THAT IT BELONGED TO A CLERK AT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FRANCS A YEAR WHO WAS STUPID AND SICKLY
UNDERSTOOD THAT HER SON HAD MET WITH MISFORTUNE FROM THAT MOMENT SHE INSISTED ON KNOWING THE TRUTH WITH SUCH A PASSIONATE OUTBURST OF DESPAIR WITH SUCH A VIOLENT FLOW OF TEARS AND SHRIEKS
UNABLE TO DETACH HIS EYES FROM HIS VICTIM HE DID NOT SUFFER HE MERELY EXPERIENCED A GREAT INNER CHILL ACCOMPANIED BY SLIGHT PRICKS ON HIS SKIN HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE TREMBLED MORE VIOLENTLY
IT FORMED A RED HOLE AS BIG AS A PENNY PIECE THE SKIN HAD BEEN TORN AWAY DISPLAYING THE ROSY FLESH STUDDED WITH DARK SPECKS
AND THEY WERE CAREFUL TO SEE INSERTED IN THE REPORT THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD PLUNGED INTO THE WATER TO SAVE CAMILLE RAQUIN THE FOLLOWING DAY THE NEWSPAPERS RELATED THE ACCIDENT WITH A GREAT DISPLAY OF DETAIL THE UNFORTUNATE MOTHER
SAID HE IN A BROKEN VOICE AH GOOD HEAVENS WHAT A FRIGHTFUL THING
HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO ATTEND TO THE BUSINESS HIMSELF NOTWITHSTANDING THAT HIS HEART ROSE WITH REPUGNANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHUDDERS THAT SOMETIMES RAN THROUGH HIS FRAME
BUT THE MURDERER WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE FOUND HIS BODY SO AS TO OBTAIN A CERTIFICATE OF DEATH THE DAY FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT A FRUITLESS SEARCH HAD BEEN MADE FOR THE CORPSE OF THE DROWNED MAN
IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HIS FRAME REVOLTED
PERCEIVING THAT EVERYTHING WAS PROCEEDING AS WELL AS HE COULD WISH LAURENT WITHDREW AND SLOWLY GAINED HIS WRETCHED DEN IN THE RUE SAINT VICTOR IT WAS PAST MIDNIGHT FRESH AIR CIRCULATED IN THE DESERTED SILENT STREETS
NUDGING ONE ANOTHER WITH THEIR ELBOWS AND MAKING BRUTAL OBSERVATIONS AT THE END OF A WEEK LAURENT BECAME DISHEARTENED AT NIGHT HE DREAMT OF THE CORPSES HE HAD SEEN IN THE MORNING
AND PRESSING HER CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF TO HER NOSTRILS SHE WORE A DELICIOUS GREY SILK SKIRT WITH A LARGE BLACK LACE MANTLE HER FACE WAS COVERED BY A VEIL AND HER GLOVED HANDS SEEMED QUITE SMALL AND DELICATE
WHEN THE YOUNG WOMAN HEARD THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE SHE STARTED AND STARED AT HIM WITH EYES WIDE OPEN SHE SEEMED AS IF CRAZY AND WAS SHUDDERING PAINFULLY SHE RAISED HERSELF INTO A SITTING POSTURE WITHOUT ANSWERING
AND THAT POOR MADAME RAQUIN HIS MOTHER
SHE WAS HALF SMILING WITH HER HEAD SLIGHTLY INCLINED ON ONE SIDE AROUND HER NECK SHE HAD A BLACK BAND WHICH GAVE HER A SORT OF NECKLET OF SHADOW SHE WAS A GIRL
HERE AND THERE THE NAKED BODIES FORMED GREEN AND YELLOW WHITE AND RED PATCHES WHILE SOME RETAINED THEIR NATURAL CONDITION IN THE RIGIDITY OF DEATH OTHERS SEEMED LIKE LUMPS OF BLEEDING AND DECAYING MEAT
WHO HAD HANGED HERSELF IN A FIT OF LOVE MADNESS EACH MORNING WHILE LAURENT WAS THERE HE HEARD BEHIND HIM THE COMING AND GOING OF THE PUBLIC WHO ENTERED AND LEFT THE MORGUE IS A SIGHT WITHIN REACH OF EVERYBODY AND ONE TO WHICH PASSERS BY
HAD NOT SUZANNE TAKEN HER ROUND THE WAIST WEEPING ON HER KNEES AND RAISING HER PALE COUNTENANCE TOWARDS HER OLIVIER AND HIS FATHER ON THEIR FEET UNNERVED AND MUTE TURNED ASIDE THEIR HEADS
THE LADY EXAMINED HIM TURNED HIM ROUND AND WEIGHED HIM SO TO SAY WITH HER EYES FOR A TIME SHE SEEMED QUITE ABSORBED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THIS MAN SHE RAISED A CORNER OF HER VEIL FOR ONE LAST LOOK
SOONER THAN WE OUGHT TO TELL IT TO HER WAIT FOR US HERE THIS ARRANGEMENT RELIEVED THE MURDERER WHO SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT OF ENTERING THE SHOP IN THE ARCADE HE RECOVERED HIS CALM
GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE DROWNING IN ITS SMALLEST DETAILS DESCRIBING HOW THE THREE HOLIDAY MAKERS HAD FALLEN INTO THE WATER AS IF THEY THEMSELVES HAD WITNESSED THE MISFORTUNE HAD OLIVIER AND HIS FATHER THE LEAST SUSPICION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISPELLED AT ONCE BY THIS TESTIMONY
AS TO OLD MICHAUD HE UTTERED EXCLAMATIONS OF FRIGHT COMMISERATION AND ASTONISHMENT HE FIDGETED ON HIS CHAIR JOINED HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND CAST UP HIS EYES TO THE CEILING
HE FELT THE HAND TREMBLE BUT IT WAS NOT WITHDRAWN ON THE CONTRARY IT EVER AND ANON GAVE A SUDDEN CARESS THESE TWO HANDS ONE IN THE OTHER WERE BURNING THE MOIST PALMS ADHERED
EACH OF THEM BURIED HIMSELF IN A CORNER OF THE CAB WHICH JOLTED ALONG OVER THE STONES THERE THEY REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND MUTE IN THE OBSCURITY THAT PREVAILED WITHIN THE VEHICLE EVER AND ANON
AS HE FELT THEIR EYES EXAMINING HIM HE SAW DISTRUST WHERE THERE WAS NAUGHT BUT STUPOR AND PITY SUZANNE WEAKER AND PALED THAN USUAL SEEMED READY TO FAINT
A MASON WHO HAD RECENTLY KILLED HIMSELF ON THE SPOT BY FALLING FROM A SCAFFOLDING HE HAD A BROAD CHEST LARGE SHORT MUSCLES AND A WHITE WELL NOURISHED BODY DEATH HAD MADE A MARBLE STATUE OF HIM
DID MY DUTY MISS WHEN I TOLD YOU WHAT YOUR AUNT SAID YOU FORGOT YOUR DUTY WHEN YOU LISTENED TO WHAT MY AUNT SAID
AND PERSUADED HERSELF THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN THE WRONG WHEN SHE HAD ATTACHED IMPORTANCE TO ANYTHING THAT HER AUNT HAD SAID UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DELIRIUM HAVING ADOPTED THIS CONCLUSION
THE DARK GENTLEMAN ENDEAVORED TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM HE HAD AS HE SUPPOSED ALLOWED TOO LONG A TIME TO PASS AFTER AN EARLY BREAKFAST THAT MORNING WITHOUT TAKING FOOD
LIKE A GENTLEMAN ON A PEDESTRIAN EXCURSION HIS MANNERS WERE PLEASANT AND HE WAS DECIDEDLY GOOD LOOKING HIS COMPANION OLDER TALLER AND DARKER AND A FINER MAN ALTOGETHER LEANED ON HIS ARM
PERHAPS THEY ARE SHAME FACED OR PROUD OR SULLEN PERHAPS THEY DESPAIR OF OTHERS BEING ACCUSTOMED TO DESPAIR OF THEMSELVES PERHAPS THEY HAVE THEIR REASONS
SHE RESOLVED TO FACE THE PROSPECT OF A NIGHT'S SOLITUDE BY THE DEATH BED RATHER THAN PERMIT MISSUS MOSEY TO HAVE A SECOND OPPORTUNITY OF DRAWING HER OWN INFERENCES
AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT EFFECT SHE HAD PRODUCED SORELY TRIED ALREADY BY THE CRUEL PERPLEXITIES OF HER POSITION EMILY'S COURAGE FAILED TO RESIST THE FIRST SENSATION OF HORROR
NO MOTHER NATURE IS STEPMOTHER TO THE SICK AT HEART SOON TOO SOON SHE COULD HARDLY SEE WHERE SHE WENT AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE RESOLUTELY CLEARED HER EYES UNDER THE SHELTER OF HER VEIL
IN THE CASE OF THE WISER ANIMALS THE PERSON SUBMITS TO SLEEP IT IS ONLY THE SUPERIOR HUMAN BEING WHO TRIES THE HOPELESS EXPERIMENT OF MAKING SLEEP SUBMIT TO THE PERSON WAKEFUL ON THE WARM SIDE OF THE PILLOW
THERE WAS THE WELCOME NAME THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE
CHOOSE YOUR OWN TIME MY POOR CHILD AND COME AND STAY WITH ME AT BRIGHTON THE SOONER THE BETTER EMILY SHRANK
INCAPABLE OF GIVING EXACT DATES CECILIA HAD INFORMED HER THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN THE AUTUMN THE MONTH TO CHOOSE IN BEGINNING HER EXAMINATION WAS THEREFORE THE MONTH OF AUGUST NO DISCOVERY REWARDED HER
TWO GENTLEMEN PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT MISTER ROOK'S HOUSE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ESPECIALLY EXCITED HIS ATTENTION THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO WAS SHORT AND OF FAIR COMPLEXION HE CARRIED A KNAPSACK
FOR WHAT MISSUS MOSEY HAD HEARD UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WAS BUT ONE WAY OF ESCAPING FROM THIS DILEMMA AND EMILY DELIBERATELY TOOK IT SHE TURNED HER BACK ON HER OWN CONVICTIONS
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THE FIRST HOUR OF HER SEARCH STRENGTHENED THE SINCERE SENSE OF GRATITUDE WITH WHICH SHE REMEMBERED THE BOOKSELLER'S KINDNESS TO KEEP HER ATTENTION STEADILY FIXED
WHAT DID YOU DO AFTER MAKING THESE DISCOVERIES I CLOSED THE YARD DOOR THEN I LOCKED THE OTHER DOOR
BRIGHTON WAS ALWAYS THE SAME THE SEA WAS ALWAYS THE SAME THE DRIVES WERE ALWAYS THE SAME FRANCINE FELT A PRESENTIMENT THAT SHE SHOULD DO SOMETHING DESPERATE UNLESS EMILY JOINED HER AND MADE BRIGHTON ENDURABLE
WHICH RAISED HER SINKING SPIRITS ON LEAVING THE COTTAGE THAT MORNING SHE HAD GIVEN CERTAIN INSTRUCTIONS RELATING TO THE MODEST STRANGER WHO HAD TAKEN CHARGE OF HER CORRESPONDENCE IN CASE OF HIS PAYING A SECOND VISIT
CONFUSED AND FRIGHTENED AS SHE WAS MISSUS MOSEY STILL FOUND RELIEF IN HER CUSTOMARY FLOW OF WORDS MANY AND MANY A PERSON HAVE I NURSED IN FEVER SHE ANNOUNCED
DID MISS LETITIA FANCY SHE WAS ADDRESSING A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN YOU WERE NURSING HER SHE CALLED OUT LIKE A PERSON MAKING PUBLIC PROCLAMATION WHEN I WAS IN HER ROOM WHOEVER YOU ARE GOOD PEOPLE
BUT THE RAIN CONTINUED TO FALL HEAVILY SOON AFTER ELEVEN THE GUESTS AT THE INN RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT THERE WAS SOME LITTLE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE TWO TRAVELERS AS TO WHICH OF THEM SHOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF THE TRUCKLE BED IT WAS PUT AN END TO
SO FAR AS HE COULD JUDGE IN A SWOON HAVING A FLASK WITH BRANDY IN IT HE REVIVED THE FAINTING MAN AND LED HIM TO THE INN THIS STATEMENT WAS CONFIRMED BY A LABORER WHO WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE VILLAGE AT THE TIME
WITH A MAKESHIFT BED AT ONE END OF IT AND A MAKESHIFT BED AT THE OTHER I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOR THAT WAS HOW YOUR AUNT PUT IT SHE SPOKE OF
CONSCIOUS OF THE ERROR INTO WHICH HER OWN IMPATIENCE HAD LED HER SHE WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO RETRACE THE FALSE STEP THAT SHE HAD TAKEN BUT TWO ALTERNATIVES PRESENTED THEMSELVES EITHER TO ABANDON THE HOPE OF MAKING ANY DISCOVERY
TO MODIFY THE ARBITRARY INSTRUCTIONS OF HIS EMPLOYER THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAS NO MERCY ON HIMSELF AND NO MERCY ON OTHERS HE EXPLAINED WHERE HIS LITERARY LABORS ARE CONCERNED
HAPPY IN THE COMPANY OF HER LIGHT HEARTED FRIEND THE LONELY INTERVAL PASSED AND PERSONS CAME NEAR TWO SISTERS GIRLS LIKE HERSELF STOPPED TO REST ON THE BENCH
WAS TO FIND EXACTLY THE EXAMPLE OF WHICH SHE STOOD MOST IN NEED AS THE HOURS WORE ON SHE PURSUED HER WEARY WAY DOWN ONE COLUMN AND UP ANOTHER RESIGNED AT LEAST IF NOT QUITE RECONCILED YET
IT MUST BE GIANTS THAT SAIL IN IT FROST GIANTS SAID ANOTHER OF THE MEN BUT AS THEY CAME NEARER
OR STRANGE MEN MIGHT COME OUT OF THIS INLAND ICE AND KILL OUR PEOPLE WE MUST STAY TOGETHER FARTHER NORTH THEY FOUND ONLY THE SAME BARE FROZEN COUNTRY SO AFTER A WHILE THEY SAILED BACK TO THEIR HOME AND LIVED THERE
SOMETIMES THE SUN SHOWED FOR AN HOUR SOMETIMES FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES SOMETIMES IT DID NOT SHOW AT ALL FOR A WEEK THE MEN HUNTED BY THE BRIGHT SHINING OF THE MOON OR BY THE NORTHERN LIGHTS AS IT GREW WARMER
GRAIN GROWS WILD AND YOU YOURSELVES SAW THE GRAPES THAT WE GOT FROM THERE THE FORESTS ARE WITHOUT END THE SEA IS FULL OF FISH THE GREENLANDERS LISTENED WITH OPEN MOUTHS TO ALL THIS
WHAT WILL HE NOT DO SOME MEN LIKED THE SOUND OF IT AND THEY CAME TO ERIC AND SAID WE WILL GO WITH YOU TO THIS STRANGE LAND SO ALL WERE READY AND THEY PUSHED OFF WITH ERIC'S FAMILY ABOARD AND THOSE FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED HIM
THE KING GAVE HIM TWO THRALLS AS A PARTING GIFT LET THIS GIFT SHOW MY LOVE LEIF ERICSSON HE SAID FOR YOUR SAKE I SHALL NOT FORGET GREENLAND LEIF SAILED BACK AGAIN AND HAD GOOD LUCK UNTIL HE WAS PAST ICELAND
WE SHALL SURELY FIND SOMETHING I DO NOT KNOW EITHER HOW LONG WE MUST GO SO THEY SAILED THAT STRANGE OCEAN NEVER DREAMING WHAT MIGHT BE AHEAD OF THEM THEY FOUND NO ISLANDS TO REST ON THEY MET HEAVY FOGS
BUT WHEN THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY FOUND NO PLACE TO GO IN STEEP BLACK WALLS SHOT UP FROM THE SEA NOTHING GREW ON THEM WHEN THE MEN LOOKED ABOVE THE CLIFFS THEY SAW A LONG LINE OF WHITE CUTTING THE SKY IT IS A LAND OF ICE
WHEN THEY SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN THEY COULD NOT TALK ENOUGH OF OLD TIMES IN THE SPRING ERIC MEANS TO GIVE HIM A FARM UP THE FIORD A WAY IT SEEMS THAT THIS THORBIORN COMES OF A GOOD FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN RICH AND GREAT IN ICELAND FOR YEARS
IT WAS SUCH A FEAST AS HAD NOT BEEN IN ICELAND FOR YEARS THORBIORN SPENT ON IT ALL THE WEALTH THAT HE HAD LEFT FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT LEAVE IN SHAME MEN SHALL REMEMBER MY LAST FEAST
LUCK HAS FOLLOWED ME ALL THE WAY SAID LEIF SEE WHAT I HAVE BROUGHT HOME THE GREENLANDERS LOOKED LUMBER LUMBER THEY CRIED OH IT IS BETTER STUFF THAN GOLD
NOW ERIC HAD LIVED IN GREENLAND FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HIS SONS THORSTEIN AND LEIF HAD GROWN UP TO BE BIG STRONG MEN ONE SPRING LEIF SAID TO HIS FATHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN NORWAY OUR MOTHER LAND
THERE ARE SOME OF US WHO WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO ERIC CALLED A MAN FROM ACROSS THE FIRE IS IT SO ERIC CRIED LEAPING UP OH THEN WE SHALL HAVE SOME MERRY TIMES YET
LINED WITH SEAL FUR HIS LONG SWORD STUCK OUT FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK ON HIS HEAD HE PUT A KNITTED CAP OF BRIGHT COLORS THEN HE WALKED TO THE KING'S FEAST HALL AND WENT THROUGH THE DOOR
IT WAS A GREAT HALL AND IT WAS FULL OF RICHLY DRESSED MEN THE FIRES SHONE ON SO MANY GOLDEN HEAD BANDS AND BRACELETS AND SO MANY GLITTERING SWORDS AND SPEARS ON THE WALL AND THERE WAS SO MUCH NOISE OF TALKING AND LAUGHING
SO LEIF SAT IN THE HIGH SEAT OPPOSITE ERIC ALL MEN THOUGHT HIM A HANDSOME AND WISE MAN HE TOLD THEM OF THE STORM AND OF WINELAND NO MAN WOULD EVER NEED A CLOAK THERE THE SOIL IS RICHER THAN THE SOIL OF NORWAY
SOME MEN WENT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT FROLIC TO GO TO A NEW COUNTRY SOME WENT BECAUSE THEY WERE POOR IN ICELAND AND THOUGHT I CAN BE NO WORSE OFF IN GREENLAND AND PERHAPS I SHALL GROW RICH THERE AND SOME WENT BECAUSE THEY LOVED ERIC
AND WANTED TO BE HIS NEIGHBORS SO THE NEXT SUMMER THIRTY FIVE SHIPS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN AND GOODS FOLLOWED ERIC FOR GREENLAND BUT THEY MET HEAVY STORMS AND SOME SHIPS WERE WRECKED AND THE MEN DROWNED
ONCE ERIC AND HIS MEN CLIMBED THE CLIFFS AND WENT BACK INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAND WHEN THEY CAME HOME THEY HAD THIS TO TELL IT IS A COUNTRY OF ICE SHINING WHITE NOTHING GROWS ON IT BUT A FEW MOSSES
HE WAS A GREAT GRANDSON OF HARALD HAIRFAIR FOR HARALD HAD BEEN DEAD A HUNDRED YEARS NOW THE KING WAS GOING TO HOLD A FEAST AT NIGHT AND LEIF PUT ON HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES TO GO TO IT
THEY ATE THE MEAT AND WORE THE SKINS TO KEEP THEM WARM THE HARDEST THING WAS TO GET FUEL FOR THE FIRE NO TREES GREW THERE THE MEN FOUND A LITTLE DRIFTWOOD ALONG THE SHORE
WHY DID YOU NOT SET OUT TO LOOK FOR HIM WHO KNOWS WHAT TERRIBLE THING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM IN THESE GREAT FORESTS THEN HE TURNED AND STARTED OUT TO HUNT FOR HIM HIS MEN FOLLOWED SILENT AND ASHAMED
WE WILL FILL THE ROWBOAT WITH GRAPES AND TOW IT BEHIND US THE SHIP WE WILL LOAD WITH LOGS FROM THESE GREAT TREES THAT WILL BE A WELCOME SHIPLOAD IN GREENLAND WHERE WE HAVE NEITHER TREES NOR VINES
SO THEY BURNED THE BONES AND THE FAT OF THE ANIMALS THEY KILLED IT IS A SICKENING SMELL THORHILD SAID I HAVE NOT BEEN OUT OF THIS MEAN HOUSE FOR WEEKS I AM TIRED OF THE DARKNESS AND THE SMOKE AND THE CATTLE
THEY TOOK HORSES AND CATTLE WITH THEM AND ALL KINDS OF TOOLS AND FOOD I DO NOT WELL KNOW WHERE THIS LAND IS ERIC SAID GUNNBIORN SAID ONLY THAT HE SAILED EAST WHEN HE CAME HOME TO ICELAND SO I WILL STEER STRAIGHT WEST
ERIC LAUGHED DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT STORY THAT GUNNBIORN TOLD
NOW HALF OF YOU SHALL GATHER GRAPES FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THE OTHER HALF SHALL CUT TIMBER SO THEY DID AND AFTER A WEEK SAILED OFF THE SHIP WAS FULL OF LUMBER AND THEY TOWED THE ROWBOAT LOADED WITH GRAPES
FOR A WEEK OR MORE THEY STAYED IN HIS WOODS SOMETIMES IN A SECRET CAVE OF HIS WHEN THEY KNEW THAT THORGEST WAS ABOUT
WHILE THE PRIEST PRIVILEGED BY HIS ORDER TO MINGLE WITH PERSONS OF ALL CREEDS IS OPEN ALERT AND LIBERAL IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH THEM DESIROUS OF POPULARITY
AT LEAST SOME OF THEM WERE I SUPPOSE AND THAT HORRID GHASTLY FUNERAL AND DEBTS I DON'T DOUBT DUE BY THE CURSED OLD COUNTESS
AND USUALLY SKILFUL IN THE MODE OF OBTAINING IT FATHER VAUGHAN WAS A PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCE OF RASHLEIGH'S OTHERWISE IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WOULD SCARCE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN HIS FOOTING AT OSBALDISTONE HALL
AND SO WOULD I YOU DON'T SUPPOSE I ORDERED IT TO BE DONE POOR DEAR THING IF IT COULD DO HER ANY GOOD GOD KNOWS I WOULD NOT BEGRUDGE IT
THAT MY FATHER SHOULD LEAVE THE CARE OF SUPPLYING MY NECESSITIES TO HIS CLERK BUT I CONCLUDED IT WAS A MATTER ARRANGED BETWEEN THEM AT ANY RATE OWEN WAS A BACHELOR RICH IN HIS WAY AND PASSIONATELY ATTACHED TO ME
WAVERLEY ASKED FOR WHAT JOYFUL OCCASION MISS MAC IVOR MADE SUCH AMPLE PREPARATION IT IS FOR FERGUS'S BRIDAL SHE SAID SMILING INDEED SAID EDWARD HE HAS KEPT HIS SECRET WELL
A MAN DOESN'T MARRY AN EARL'S DAUGHTER FOR NOTHING BUTTERWELL AND THEN TO THINK WHAT I LOST IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW YOU KNOW
I RAISED SOMETHING OVER FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS AND NOW I OWE FIVE WHICH MUST BE PAID PART TO MORROW AND THE REMAINDER THIS DAY MONTH AND YOU'VE NO SECURITY
MISTER WAVERLEY IS JUST NOW TOO MUCH AGITATED BY FEELINGS OF RECENT EMOTION FOR ME TO PRESS UPON HIM A RESOLUTION OF CONSEQUENCE
IT MAY BE SAID THAT THIS MODE FAILS OFTENER THAN ANY OTHER THERE IS THE PITEOUS MANNER THE PLEA FOR COMMISERATION MY DEAR FELLOW UNLESS YOU WILL SEE ME THROUGH NOW UPON MY WORD I SHALL BE VERY BADLY OFF
HOPE YOU WILL ADVISE THE ABOVE COMING SAFE TO HAND AM SORRY WE HAVE SO FEW OF YOURS YOUR FATHER SAYS HE IS AS USUAL BUT LOOKS POORLY FROM THIS EPISTLE WRITTEN IN OLD OWEN'S FORMAL STYLE
WITHOUT HIS ABSENCE OR PRESENCE ATTRACTING ANY OBSERVATION BUT DURING HIS ABSENCE THE STAIR AND THE TURRET DOOR WERE ENTIRELY DISUSED AND THIS MADE ANDREW'S OBSERVATION SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE HAVE YOU OFTEN OBSERVED THAT DOOR OPEN
AND NOTE THE CONTENTS SHALL DO MISTER R O SUCH CIVILITIES AS ARE IN MY POWER AND HAVE TAKEN HIM TO SEE THE BANK AND CUSTOM HOUSE HE SEEMS A SOBER STEADY YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND TAKES TO BUSINESS
AND FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WHIGS THEN IN POWER HAD INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO OBTAIN A HEARING FOR MY CAUSE SO UPON THE WHOLE I JUDGED IT MOST SAFE TO STATE MY WHOLE STORY IN THE SHAPE OF A NARRATIVE
COULD LEAVE THE HALL OR RETURN TO IT AT PLEASURE
IF EVER HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF PLEADING HIS OWN CAUSE WITH HER HE CERTAINLY WOULD TELL HER EVERYTHING RESPECTING HIS OWN MONEY DIFFICULTIES IN THAT LAST RESOLVE I THINK WE MAY SAY THAT HE WAS RIGHT
GOD KNOWS MINE EXCEEDS HIS IF THAT BE POSSIBLE BUT I AM NOT LIKE HIM RAPT BY THE BUSTLE OF MILITARY PREPARATION AND THE INFINITE DETAIL NECESSARY TO THE PRESENT UNDERTAKING
THAT CONDESCENDING FRIEND WHO WOULD STRENGTHEN ME TO REDEEM MY ERRORS MY FUTURE LIFE HUSH MY DEAR SIR
AS AN IDEA TO WHICH NO RECEPTION COULD BE GIVEN FOR A MOMENT CROSBIE HAD NOT BEEN TREATED AS WAS THE NEEDY KNIFE GRINDER
CAN ONLY BE FURTHERED BY MEASURES IN THEMSELVES TRUE AND JUST TO OPERATE UPON YOUR PRESENT FEELINGS MY DEAR MISTER WAVERLEY TO INDUCE YOU TO AN IRRETRIEVABLE STEP
BUT LADY ALEXANDRINA YES OF COURSE I KNOW I
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT I AM ONLY NOW FREE FROM THE
THAT'S JUST HOW I STAND I OWED GAZEBEE SOMETHING OVER A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH IS ARRANGED AS I HAVE TOLD YOU
THIS GAVE ME NO DESIRE TO CULTIVATE HIS INTIMACY NOR DID HE SEEM TO MAKE ANY ADVANCES TOWARDS MINE SO OUR OCCASIONAL INTERCOURSE WAS CONFINED TO THE EXCHANGE OF MERE CIVILITY I CONSIDERED IT AS EXTREMELY PROBABLE
NO MISS MAC IVOR I DARE NOT HOPE IT A THOUSAND CIRCUMSTANCES OF FATAL SELF INDULGENCE HAVE MADE ME THE CREATURE RATHER OF IMAGINATION THAN REASON DURST I BUT HOPE COULD I BUT THINK
BUT IT'S HARD TO REFUSE WHEN ONE MAN HAS KNOWN ANOTHER FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS THEN HE COMFORTED HIMSELF SOMEWHAT WITH THE REFLECTION THAT CROSBIE WOULD NO DOUBT MAKE HIMSELF MORE PLEASANT FOR THE FUTURE THAN HE HAD DONE LATELY AND WITH A SECOND REFLECTION
MISTER BUTTERWELL GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS HE WAS THINKING AT THAT MOMENT WHAT MISSUS BUTTERWELL WOULD SAY TO HIM WILL AN ANSWER DO TO MORROW MORNING HE SAID
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NONE SUCH IN SCOTLAND NA NA ANSWERED ANDREW BOLDLY THEN SHADED AWAY HIS NEGATIVE WITH UNLESS IT BE ON FASTERN'S E'EN OR THE LIKE O THAT
I HAVE AS YET SAID NOTHING FOR I HAD SEEN BUT LITTLE HE WAS AGED ABOUT SIXTY OF A GOOD FAMILY AS I WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND IN THE NORTH OF A STRIKING AND IMPOSING PRESENCE GRAVE IN HIS EXTERIOR
AN HUNDRED FIRELOCKS MY FRIEND AND AS MANY BROADSWORDS JUST ARRIVED FROM GOOD FRIENDS
IF IT HAD REACHED HIM IN SAFETY I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE RECEIPT OF THE BILL AND PROMISED TO MAKE USE OF THE CONTENTS IF I SHOULD HAVE ANY OCCASION FOR MONEY I THOUGHT INDEED IT WAS ODD
THAT IS THE CASE EVERYWHERE RESPONDED MISTER MERRICK THOUGHTFULLY AND BETWEEN US MC NUTT I'M GLAD WAGES ARE BETTER IN THESE PROSPEROUS TIMES
ETHEL THOMPSON HAD REFUSED TO ACCEPT ANY PAYMENT FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE BUT PEGGY BRAVELY CHARGED IT UP AT GOOD ROUND FIGURES WHEN THE BILL WAS MADE OUT AND FIGURED UP
HE PUT THEM DOWN AT THREE DOLLARS A DAY AND MADE THE DAYS STRETCH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALSO HE CHARGED A ROUND COMMISSION ON THE WAGES OF LON TAFT AND NED LONG AND DOUBLED THE LIVERYMAN'S BILL FOR HAULING THE GOODS OVER FROM THE JUNCTION
AND THE SHREWD ALERT LOOK THAT ACCOMPANIED IT EVEN MILLIONAIRES DO NOT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE SWINDLED IF THEY CAN HELP IT
AND WITH A SORT OF SHEEPISH SULLENNESS SHE INSTANTLY TURNED HER HORSE'S HEAD TOWARDS ME SAYING WELL WELL THORNIE IF YOU WON'T I MUST THAT'S ALL SIR SHE CONTINUED ADDRESSING ME
DON'T YOU SCENT SOME MYSTERY IN WHAT THE MAN SAID OF IT MYSTERY CRIED UNCLE JOHN LORDY NO LOUISE YOU'VE BEEN READIN TOO MANY NOVELS ROMANCES DON'T GROW IN PARTS LIKE THESE BUT I THINK THIS IS WHERE THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO GROW UNCLE
BUT WHAT ON EARTH BRINGS YOU TO CUB CASTLE FOR SO THE NEIGHBOURS HAVE CHRISTENED THIS HUNTING HALL OF OURS YOU MIGHT HAVE STAYED AWAY I SUPPOSE IF YOU WOULD
DUFFER AS TO RETURN THAT MONEY
EXCEPT HIS PALE WIFE OF COURSE AND SHE IS DESCRIBED AS SAD AND UNHAPPY WHO WAS SHE DO YOU THINK I DON'T THINK SAID UNCLE JOHN SMILING AND PATTING THE FAIR CHECK OF HIS NIECE
HOSSES IS HIGH TOO HE REMARKED COMPLACENTLY AN LUMBER AN NAILS IS UP AS FER THE LIVE STOCK I BOUGHT FER YE I FOUND I HAD TO PAY LIKE SIXTY FOR IT
WHICH HE HAD INTENDED TO PAY IF THE SMALLER BILL HAD BEEN PRESENTED UNCLE JOHN TOOK THE MONEY YOU ARE AN HONEST FELLOW MC NUTT SAID HE I HADN'T EXPECTED A DOLLAR BACK
THE CAP'N BOUGHT THIS NO'COUNT FARM AN HAD THIS HOUSE BUILT ON IT A PROCEEDIN THAT EF I DO SAY IT
WITHOUT A DOUBT I TRIED FER TO DO MY BEST SIR HE SAID AND YOU DID VERY WELL WAS THE REPLY I HOPE YOU KEPT YOUR EXPENDITURES WELL WITHIN BOUNDS THE AGENT'S HEART SANK AT THE QUESTION
AND THEN INTIMATED HIS INTENTION OF LEAVING ME THAT HE MIGHT HELP THE HUNTSMAN AND HIS BROTHERS TO COUPLE UP THE HOUNDS A PURPOSE WHICH HE RATHER COMMUNICATED BY WAY OF INFORMATION TO MISS VERNON THAN AS APOLOGY TO ME THERE HE GOES SAID THE YOUNG LADY
THE TWO GIRLS WOULD PLAY TENNIS OR CROQUET TOGETHER BETH INVARIABLY WINNING SUCH DELIGHTFUL LAZINESS COULD BROOK NO INTERFERENCE FOR THE FIRST DAYS OF THEIR ARRIVAL AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL PEGGY MC NUTT VENTURED OVER ON MONDAY MORNING
FIRST MADE HIS APPEARANCE FROM THE COPSE WHICH CLOTHED THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE VALLEY HIS DROOPING BRUSH HIS SOILED APPEARANCE AND JADED TROT PROCLAIMED HIS FATE IMPENDING
I PAUSED THEREFORE ON A RISING GROUND AND NOT UNMOVED BY THE SENSE OF INTEREST WHICH THAT SPECIES OF SILVAN SPORT IS SO MUCH CALCULATED TO INSPIRE
AS SHE PASSED ME HER HORSE MADE IN HIS IMPETUOSITY AN IRREGULAR MOVEMENT JUST WHILE COMING ONCE MORE UPON OPEN GROUND SHE WAS AGAIN PUTTING HIM TO HIS SPEED IT SERVED AS AN APOLOGY FOR ME TO RIDE CLOSE UP TO HER
WHO HAS BEEN FOR SOME DAYS EXPECTED AT OSBALDISTONE HALL I WAS TOO HAPPY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF TO BE THE PARTY INQUIRED AFTER AND TO EXPRESS MY THANKS FOR THE OBLIGING INQUIRIES OF THE YOUNG LADY IN THAT CASE SIR SHE REJOINED
AND THAT FINISHED THE ROMANCE LOUISE OH NO THAT ADDED TO ITS INTEREST THE BOY GREW UP IN THIS DISMAL PLACE AND BROODED ON HIS MOTHER'S WRONGS HIS STERN SULKY OLD FATHER DIED SUDDENLY WAS HE MURDERED
I AM VERY MUCH PLEASED THERE SEEMS TO BE A HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS MY DUE REMAINING FROM THE FIVE HUNDRED I SENT YOU HERE IT IS SIR RESPONDED MC NUTT TAKING THE MONEY FROM HIS POCKET BOOK IN ANOTHER PLACE HE HAD MORE MONEY
PATTING THE NECK OF THE BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL ON WHICH SHE RODE HAD NOT GOT AMONG THE CLIFFS YOU WOULD HAVE HAD LITTLE CAUSE FOR BOASTING THEY MET AS SHE SPOKE
SEEMED TO INVITE THE TRAVELLER TO EXPLORE THEIR RECESSES THE CHEVIOTS ROSE BEFORE ME IN FROWNING MAJESTY NOT INDEED WITH THE SUBLIME VARIETY OF ROCK AND CLIFF WHICH CHARACTERIZES MOUNTAINS OF THE PRIMARY CLASS
THE KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH RECKLESS EXPENDITURES HAD FORTIFIED LITTLE MC NUTT IN MARKING UP THE ACCOUNT OF THE MONEY HE HAD RECEIVED AND INSTEAD OF CHARGING TWO DOLLARS A DAY FOR HIS OWN SERVICES
AND DRESSED IN GREEN AND RED THE UNIFORM OF A SPORTING ASSOCIATION FORMED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF OLD SIR HILDEBRAND OSBALDISTONE MY COUSINS THOUGHT I AS THEY SWEPT PAST ME THE NEXT REFLECTION WAS
HAVING IN THE HURRY OF THE CHASE ESCAPED FROM THE RIBBON WHICH BOUND IT SOME VERY BROKEN GROUND THROUGH WHICH SHE GUIDED HER HORSE WITH THE MOST ADMIRABLE ADDRESS AND PRESENCE OF MIND RETARDED HER COURSE AND BROUGHT HER CLOSER TO ME THAN ANY OF THE OTHER RIDERS HAD PASSED
WITH THESE WORDS UNCLE JOHN AROSE AND SAUNTERED AROUND TO THE BARN TO LOOK AT THE LITTER OF NEW PIGS THAT JUST THEN SERVED TO INTEREST AND AMUSE HIM
OR MISCONDUCT OF MY ANCESTORS BUT ENOUGH WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE OLD MANSION TO GIVE MY UNCLE THE TITLE OF A MAN OF LARGE PROPERTY THIS HE EMPLOYED AS I WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND BY SOME INQUIRIES WHICH I MADE ON THE ROAD
WAS AT A CLOSE ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHOM WE HAD SEEN APPROACHED US WAVING THE BRUSH OF THE FOX IN TRIUMPH AS IF TO UPBRAID MY FAIR COMPANION I SEE SHE REPLIED I SEE BUT MAKE NO NOISE ABOUT IT IF PHOEBE SHE SAID
A VISION THAT PASSED ME INTERRUPTED THESE REFLECTIONS IT WAS A YOUNG LADY THE LOVELINESS OF WHOSE VERY STRIKING FEATURES WAS ENHANCED BY THE ANIMATION OF THE CHASE AND THE GLOW OF THE EXERCISE
PARTICULARLY HAD IT HAPPENED IN A YOUNG CHILD BUT HERE WE HAVE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT A GROWN LADY IS CHANGED STRAIGHTWAY INTO A FOX THERE IS NO EXPLAINING THAT AWAY BY ANY NATURAL PHILOSOPHY
WHO HAS JUST COME INTO THE TITLE MA'M AND
MADE WITH GIRLISH SIMPLICITY WHICH ADMIRABLY BECAME HER AND A WIDE FLEXIBLE BRIMMED HAT WITH A SINGLE HEAVY PLUME TAKEN FROM BETTY'S OWN HAT OF THE LAST WINTER CASSANDRA STOOD A LONG MOMENT BEFORE THE TWO GOWNS
NAY EVEN IN HIS PASSION TEARING OPEN HIS WAISTCOAT AND HIS SHIRT THAT SHE MIGHT LIE THE CLOSER TO HIS HEART FOR WHEN WE ARE OVERCOME WITH THE GREATEST SORROW WE ACT NOT LIKE MEN OR WOMEN
FOR IM TO LOOK SO LIKE BEING AS E BELONGED TO THE YOUNGER BRANCH WHO AVEN'T ELD THE TITLE FOR FOUR GENERATIONS BUT COME TO DRESS IM IN VELVET AND GOLD LACE AND THE LIKENESS WOULD BE NIGH AS PERFECT AS IF E AD STOOD FOR IT
AND FOR THAT VERY REASON CLAIMED LITTLE OF THE GENERAL ATTENTION OF MANKIND FOR THE SUDDEN CHANGING OF MISSUS TEBRICK INTO A VIXEN IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT WHICH WE MAY ATTEMPT TO ACCOUNT FOR AS WE WILL
A CHILL STRUCK TO HER BONES AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE VAST CLOSED ROOMS
IT WAS A PLEASANT MORNING IN LONDON WITH AS CLEAR A SKY AS IS EVER PERMITTED TO THAT GREAT CITY CASSANDRA HAD PLACED HER LITTLE SON IN THE MIDDLE OF A HUGE BED WHICH NEARLY FILLED THE SMALL ROOM SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN IN A HOTEL
BECAUSE HE HAD NOT GUESSED THAT HIS WIFE WOULD NOT LIKE TO GO NAKED NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHAPE SHE WAS IN NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THEN TILL HE HAD CLOTHED HER SUITABLY BRINGING HER DRESSES FROM THE WARDROBE FOR HER TO CHOOSE
WHEN HE RECOLLECTED HIMSELF AND THE NEXT THING WAS THAT HE MUST SOMEHOW HIDE HER AND THEN BRING HER HOME HE WAITED TILL IT WAS QUITE DARK THAT HE MIGHT THE BETTER BRING HER INTO HER OWN HOUSE WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND BUTTONED HER INSIDE HIS TOPCOAT
AND GRACEFUL ENTER A CAB AND A MAID FOLLOWING HER WEARING A PRETTY CAP AND CARRYING A CHILD EAGER FOR DAVID'S SAKE TO DRAW NO ADVERSE COMMENT UPON HERSELF SHE TOOK NOTE OF EVERYTHING
THE SETTER JUMPING UP AND DOWN AT THE END OF HIS CHAIN IN A FRENZY AND NELLY SHIVERING WAGGING HER TAIL AND LOOKING FIRST AT HER MASTER AND THEN AT THE HOUSE DOOR WHERE SHE COULD SMELL THE FOX RIGHT ENOUGH
WHEN A HUNT WAS STIRRING AND NEVER RODE TO HOUNDS TILL AFTER HER MARRIAGE WHEN HER HUSBAND PERSUADED HER TO IT SHE WAS MARRIED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE TO MISTER RICHARD TEBRICK AFTER A SHORT COURTSHIP
AND HE SAW AT ONCE THAT HIS WIFE WAS LOOKING AT HIM FROM THE ANIMAL'S EYES YOU MAY WELL THINK IF HE WERE AGHAST AND SO MAYBE WAS HIS LADY AT FINDING HERSELF IN THAT SHAPE SO THEY DID NOTHING FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR BUT STARE AT EACH OTHER
ESPECIALLY IN HER NOT WISHING TO RUN NAKED THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH COMFORTED AND BEGAN TO FANCY THEY COULD BE HAPPY ENOUGH IF THEY COULD ESCAPE THE WORLD AND LIVE ALWAYS ALONE FROM THIS TOO SANGUINE DREAM HE WAS AROUSED
HAVING ONCE HUNTED WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD OF TEN AND HAVING BEEN BLOODED MIGHT FURNISH MORE OF AN EXPLANATION IT SEEMS SHE TOOK GREAT FRIGHT OR DISGUST AT IT AND VOMITED AFTER IT WAS DONE
AND SHOULD HE WAIT OH YES WAIT CRIED CASSANDRA WHAT IF DAVID WERE NOT THERE AND OF COURSE HE MIGHT BE OUT THEN THEY WERE SWALLOWED UP IN THE DARK INTERIOR
BUT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THEY WERE TOO BIG FOR HER NOW BUT AT LAST HE PICKED OUT A LITTLE DRESSING JACKET THAT SHE WAS FOND OF WEARING SOMETIMES IN THE MORNINGS IT WAS MADE OF A FLOWERED SILK TRIMMED WITH LACE
AND LACE CURTAINS THAT OBSCURED THE ONE HIGH NARROW WINDOW OF HER ROOM SHE HAD TRIED TO PUT THEM ONE SIDE THAT SHE MIGHT LOOK OUT WHEN SHE AWOKE BUT SHE COULD SEE ONLY CHIMNEY POTS AND GRIMY IRREGULARLY TILED ROOFS
HE ONLY CALLED TO HER SOFTLY SILVIA SILVIA WHAT DO YOU DO THERE AND THEN IN A MOMENT SAW FOR HIMSELF WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT AND BEGAN ONCE MORE TO BLAME HIMSELF HEARTILY
HER GRAVITY AND SILENCE GAVE HER A POISE AND DIGNITY THAT ALLAYED SUSPICION BUT HE AND HIS OLD WIFE LIKED DIVERSION AND A SPICE OF GOSSIP LIGHTENED THE MONOTONY OF THEIR LIVES SO HE WAITED
AND SEA SERPENTS ENGULF EVERY PASSING SHIP AND TERRIBLE CATACLYSMS BESET HUMANITY BUT THE STRANGE EVENT WHICH I SHALL HERE RELATE CAME ALONE UNSUPPORTED WITHOUT COMPANIONS INTO A HOSTILE WORLD
FOR THE FIRST MOMENT HE THOUGHT THE ROOM WAS EMPTY AND HIS VIXEN GOT AWAY FOR HE COULD SEE NO SIGN OF HER ANYWHERE BUT AFTER A MOMENT HE SAW SOMETHING STIRRING IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM AND THEN BEHOLD SHE CAME FORTH DRAGGING HER DRESSING GOWN
OUGHT SHE THEN TO ARRIVE ATTENDED BY A MAID CARRYING HER BABY BUT DAVID WOULD KNOW SHE DID NOT NEED ONE BRINGING HIM HIS LITTLE SON IN HER OWN ARMS WHAT WOULD HE CARE FOR ANYTHING MORE SO THE ADDRESS WAS GIVEN THE CABMAN
THE SOLDIERS THE GUARDSMEN THE LIVERIED LACKEYS THE ERRAND BOYS ALL WERE THERE AND THE LADIES IN FINE CARRIAGES THERE WERE THE NURSEMAIDS THE BABIES THE BEGGARS THE RAGGED URCHINS AND THE VENDERS OF THE STREET
THE GRADUAL EXTENSION OF HAIR ALL OVER THE BODY THE SLOW CHANGE OF THE WHOLE ANATOMY BY A PROCESS OF GROWTH THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MONSTROUS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE TO OUR ORDINARY CONCEPTIONS
SHE CLASPED HER BABY CLOSER UNTIL HE LOOKED UP IN HER FACE WITH ROUND EYED WONDER AND PUT UP HIS LIP IN PITIFUL PROTEST SHE SOOTHED AND COMFORTED HIM UNTIL HER PANIC PASSED
THE LITTLE MAN COUGHED HIS DEPRECATORY COUGH AND ESSAYED TO LEAD HER ON BUT SHE WAS SEEING VISIONS AND DID NOT HEED HIM WHEN AT LAST SHE TURNED HER GRAY EYES HAD DEEPENED
OH NO I WAS BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE IN THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN MARRIAGE AND I DID WHAT I THOUGHT BECAME A WOMANLY WOMAN I ASSERTED MY RIGHTS AND MADE A COMMON OR GARDEN ROW THE DOCTOR LAUGHED AS SHE STAMPED HER FOOT AT HIM
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MAN COMES OUT OF A GREAT PASSION JUST AS GOOD AS NEW WHILE A WOMAN IS SHATTERED IN A MORAL SENSE AND NEVER FULLY RECOVERS HERSELF SHATTUCK'S BACK WAS TOWARD HER WHEN HE REPLIED
MY FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO BE DONE WITH LIFE BUT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO THAT MUCH AS I DESIRED IT IT WOULD HAVE LEFT YOU SUCH A WRETCHED MEMORY OF ME YOU COULD NEVER HAVE PARDONED ME THE SCANDAL AND I FELT THAT I HAD AT LEAST THE RIGHT TO LEAVE YOU A DECENT RECOLLECTION OF ME
AT WHICH NATURE LAUGHS YET THIS OTHER WOMAN PROUD HIGH MINDED UNSELFISH HITHERTO ABOVE REPROACH HAD GIVEN HERSELF FOR LOVE ALONE WITH EVERYTHING TO LOSE AND NOTHING TO GAIN I HAVE COME TO DOUBT MYSELF
YET ALL ABOUT US THE COUNTRY WAS SO LOVELY AND SO TRANQUIL HORSES WERE WALKING THE FIELDS AND EVEN AS WE SAT AT DINNER WE COULD HEAR THE VOICES AND THE HEAVY FEET OF THE PEASANT WOMEN AS THEY WENT HOME FROM THEIR WORK
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SPEAKING ANXIOUSLY EJACULATED I SWEAR I DON'T FOLLOW YOU SHE WENT ON AS IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY WHICH HAD TO BE SAID AS IF SHE WERE REASONING IT OUT FOR HERSELF
THE SPELL OF NATURE WAS UPON ME AND FOR A TIME I DREAMED THAT A DEPTH OF PASSIONATE LOVE LIKE MINE A LIFE OF LOYAL DEVOTION MIGHT WRAP ONE MAN ROUND AND KEEP HIM SAFE MIGHT IN FACT WORK A MIRACLE
AND MAKE ONE POLYGAMOUS MAN MONOGAMOUS BUT EVEN WHILE THAT HOPE WAS IN MY HEART REASON ROSE UP AND MOCKED IT BIDDING ME ADVANCE INTO THE FUTURE AT MY PERIL I DID IT BUT I MADE A BARGAIN WITH MYSELF
I KNOW I'VE NOT BEEN UNLOVING AND I HOPE YOU'VE NOT SUFFERED MANY DISCOMFORTS ON MY ACCOUNT I THINK AS WOMEN GO I AM FAIRLY REASONABLE OR I HAVE BEEN
VERY UNJUSTLY AND YET AS THIS LIFE IS THE ONLY ONE WE KNOW WE MUST ADJUST OURSELVES TO IT AS WE FIND IT NO NO WE HAD BETTER HAVE ACCEPTED THE THING AS NATURE GAVE IT TO US
SHE SHRANK BACK WITH A SHUDDER CRYING OUT THAT HE SHOULD SPARE HER HER OWN CONTEMPT THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE HER THE POWER TO SEEK PEACE AND HER VOICE HAD SUCH A TONE OF TERROR AS SHE RECOILED FROM HIM THAT HE FELT HOW POWERLESS ANY PROTEST WOULD BE
SORRY TO SPOIL ANY MORE ILLUSIONS DEAR CHILD BUT HOW ABOUT THE LONG LIST OF MEN WHO ARE ANNUALLY RUINED BY IT THE MEN IN THE PRISONS THE MEN WHO KILL THEMSELVES THE MEN WHO HANG FOR IT THOSE ARE CRIMES I AM NOT TALKING OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES
THAT HE WOULD NEVER DESERT HIS WIFE FOR HER HAD HE NOT BETRAYED HER OF WHAT USE TO TELL HER HOW HE HAD REPENTED HIS FOLLY THAT HE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT HIMSELF THERE WERE THE FACTS AND NATURE AND HIS WIFE'S PHILOSOPHY AGAINST HIM
I COULD NOT BEAR TO HUMBLE YOU IN YOUR OWN EYES BY LETTING YOU SUSPECT THAT I KNEW THE TRUTH I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO DISTURB THE OUTWARD RESPECTABILITY OF YOUR LIFE BY INTERRUPTING ITS OUTWARD CALM TO BE ABSOLUTELY HONEST THOUGH I HAD LOST YOU I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO GIVE YOU UP
DID I NOT FIND A CLEAR LOGICAL MIND GOING THE SAME WAY MY MIND WILL GO I MIGHT BE TROUBLED WITH DOUBTS AND AFRAID THAT I WAS GOING QUITE WRONG WELL THE DEUCE AND ALL WITH A WOMAN WHEN SHE BEGINS TO READ STUFF LIKE THAT IS HER INABILITY TO GENERALIZE
BUT NOT ENOUGH OF ONE TO BEAR THE THOUGHT OF HER ALONE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WITH MIND AND EMOTIONS CLOUDED I MAY BE COWARDLY ENOUGH TO WISH THAT I HAD NEVER FOUND IT OUT I AM NOT COWARD ENOUGH TO KEEP SILENT ANY LONGER
STILL TURNING THE LEAVES OF THE BOOK HE HELD THAT THIS PLEASES YOU NOT EXACTLY WELL AMUSES YOU INSTRUCTS YOU IF YOU LIKE THAT BETTER NO I MEAN TO SAY SIMPLY SINCE YOU INSIST THAT HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH
MEN AND WOMEN KNOW VERY RARELY ANYTHING OF THE GREAT STRUGGLES THAT GO ON IN THE HEARTS OF ONE ANOTHER BESIDES I KNEW HOW EASILY YOU WOULD REPLY NATURALLY WE ARE ALL ON THE DEFENSIVE IN THIS LIFE IT WAS WITH THINGS DEEPER THAN WORDS THAT I WAS DEALING
I'D RATHER THAT IT WERE TRUE THAT SHE HAD PICKED IT UP SOMEWHERE AS WE BEGAN TO PREPARE TO GO IN THE DOCTOR LOOKED DOWN THE PATH TO WHERE THE DIVORCEE WAS STILL STANDING
AS THE PENALTY OF YOUR LOVE NOTHING MORE I MUST BE SINGULARLY UNFITTED FOR MARRIAGE BECAUSE WHEN THE HOUR CAME IN WHICH I FELT THAT I WAS NO LONGER YOUR WIFE YOUR CHILDREN SEEMED NO LONGER MINE THEY MERELY REPRESENTED THE NEXT GENERATION BORN OF ME
I KICK AGAINST CIVILIZATION WHICH MAKES LAWS REGARDLESS OF NATURE WHICH DELIBERATELY SHUTS ITS EYES TO ALL NATURAL TRUTHS IN REGARD TO THE RELATIONS OF MEN TO WOMEN AND IS THEREFORE FORCED TO CONTINUALLY WINK TO AVOID CONFESSING ITS FOLLY

SURFEIT RETURNED WITH THANKS HAVING FULLY DIGESTED THE CONTENTS FIRST SWEET THEN SAVOURY MISTER BLOOM COASTED WARILY RUMINANTS HIS SECOND COURSE
CHAPTER ONE UNCLE JOHN'S FARM HOW DID I HAPPEN TO OWN A FARM ASKED UNCLE JOHN INTERRUPTING HIS SOUP LONG ENOUGH TO FIX AN INQUIRING GLANCE UPON MAJOR DOYLE WHO SAT OPPOSITE
AND THE INCONSEQUENT HOME ENVIRONMENTS THE GIRL WAS MORE UNAFFECTED AND NATURAL IN HER WAYS AND HER FAULTS WERE DOUBTLESS MORE THE RESULT OF EDUCATION THAN OF NATURAL TENDENCY ONE THING WAS INDISPUTABLE HOWEVER
IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT AN EFFORT TO READ TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA CAPTAIN'S ROMANCE WOULD BE A CHARMING DIVERSION WHILE SHE RESIDED AT MILLVILLE AND IN UNDERTAKING THE TASK SHE LAUGHINGLY ACCUSED HERSELF OF BECOMING AN AMATEUR DETECTIVE
THAT COPY MUST BE DESTROYED NOT SATISFIED WITH ALL THESE DIRECTIONS THE MASTER TAUGHT HIS SCHOLAR TO COUNT THE LETTERS OF EVERY BOOK
SIMPLE IN HIS TASTES MODEST AND RETIRING LACKING THE EDUCATION AND REFINEMENTS OF POLITE SOCIETY BUT SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD THE LITTLE MAN FOUND HIS GREATEST ENJOYMENT IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE
WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER WHAT OF IT RETORTED THE LITTLE ROUND FACED MILLIONAIRE LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STARING FIXEDLY AT THE OTHER THAT'S WHAT I EMPLOY YOU FOR NOW NOW GENTLEMEN CRIED PATSY EARNESTLY
IN HER PLAIN MUSLIN GOWN A STRANGER WOULD BE TEMPTED TO WONDER WHY SHE WAS RED HAIRED FRECKLED AS A ROBIN'S EGG PUG NOSED AND WIDE MOUTHED BUT HER BLUE EYES WERE BEAUTIFUL
HAVE YOU INVESTIGATED THE FARM AT ALL I LOOKED UP A REAL ESTATE DEALER LIVING AT MILLVILLE AND WROTE HIM ABOUT THE WEGG FARM HE SAID IF ANY ONE WANTED THE PLACE VERY BADLY IT MIGHT SELL FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS HUMPH
I JUST HAVE TO FORM A JUDGMENT AN TAKE ME CHANCES AND WHIN A POOR DEVIL GOES WRONG
DAN GROANED AND AMBLED SLOWLY AROUND TO WHERE UNCLE JOHN STOOD AWAITING HIS NIECE
HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE ROMAN CAMP DURING THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND HE WATCHED WITH DISMAY THE GREAT BATTERING RAMS AND WAR ENGINES CRASHING THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE HOLY CITY HIS EARS RANG WITH THE CRIES OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WHICH BROKE FROM THE JEWS WITHIN
HE REPLIED WHAT BECAME OF THE YOUNG MAN ASKED THE GIRL HE'S A COMPETENT CHAUFFEUR AND SO HE WENT TO WORK DRIVING AN AUTOMOBILE WHERE IS MILLVILLE INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN THOUGHTFULLY SOMEWHERE AT THE NORTH OF THE STATE I BELIEVE
WHEN HER UNCLE RETURNED FROM HIS VISIT TO THE PIGS LOUISE SAID TO HIM I'VE BEEN THINKING DEAR THAT WE OUGHT TO CALL UPON THAT YOUNG LADY WHO ARRANGED OUR ROOMS AND THANK HER FOR HER KINDNESS THAT'S TRUE HE REPLIED
BUCKLING A STRAP UNMOVED WHO TOL YE I WERE ONCE A SEA FARIN MAN I GUESSED IT AS HE APPEARED INDISPOSED TO SAY MORE ON THE SUBJECT SHE ASKED DID YOU SAIL WITH CAPTAIN WEGG PARTLY MISS DAN'S ALREADY NOW
AS ONE BY ONE THEIR DEFENCES FELL AND THE END DREW NEAR THEN FOOD FAILED IN THE CITY MEN FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS IN THE STREETS FOR A TINY LOAF OF BARLEY BREAD SO FRANTIC WERE THE PEOPLE WITH HUNGER
WHICH STILL GLITTERED LIKE A HILL OF SNOW IN THE MORNING SUNSHINE OR SPARKLED AS THOUGH WRAPPED IN FLAME WHEN THE SUNBEAMS STRUCK FULL ON ITS GOLDEN ROOF THEN REDDER FLAMES THAN EVER THE SUNSHINE MADE LEAPT ABOVE THE GOLDEN ROOF
THAT MOTHERS EVEN SNATCHED THE BREAD FROM THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S MOUTHS LOOK OVER THE WALLS O PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM THE ROMAN SOLDIERS ARE CRUCIFYING ALL THE PRISONERS THEY HAVE TAKEN AND THE LINE OF CROSSES IS AS LONG AS OUR CITY IS WIDE
BUT HIS BEST INFORMATION WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT NO ONE WANTED IT AT ALL PATSY LAUGHED POOR UNCLE JOHN SHE SAID THE LITTLE MAN HOWEVER WAS SERIOUS
WHAT DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THEIR OLD MASTER'S SECRET HISTORY WHAT TRAGIC MEMORIES LURKED BENEATH THE MAN'S PERPETUAL SMILE AND THE WOMAN'S COMPOSED AND SIGHTLESS FACE SURELY THERE WAS ENOUGH HERE TO EXCITE THE CURIOSITY
OR WHY SOMEONE DON'T KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD DAN TURNED HIS LONG LEAN FACE AS IF TO GIVE THE SPEAKER A REPROACHFUL LOOK THEN HE GROANED AGAIN LEANED FORWARD AND DREW THE BUGGY SLOWLY INTO THE STONY LANE
WERE NEARLY FORGOTTEN IN THE COMMUNITY AND SOON WOULD BE FORGOTTEN ALTOGETHER UNLESS THE QUICK EAR OF A YOUNG GIRL HAD CAUGHT THE CLUE SO LONG IGNORED AT FIRST SHE SCARCELY APPRECIATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING
OVER WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HAD SAILED SO OFTEN AND BESIDE WHOSE SHORES HE HAD DONE SO MANY WONDERFUL DEEDS OF LOVE AND MERCY A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL COLLEGE IT WAS WITH BROAD TERRACED GARDENS
THAT THEY DECLARED A MAN TO BE A BLOCKHEAD IF HE KNEW ONLY THE SCRIPTURES AND NOT THE TALMUD EXPLANATION THE LAW OF MOSES IS LIKE SALT BUT THE TALMUD IS BALMY SPICE THEY WOULD SAY
AND THE WELFARE AND ENTERTAINMENT OF HIS THREE NIECES HE HAD RESCUED MAJOR DOYLE AND HIS DAUGHTER FROM A LOWLY CONDITION AND PLACED THE FORMER IN THE GREAT BANKING HOUSE OF ISHAM MARVIN AND COMPANY
SO ALL DAY LONG THEY STUDIED AND COPIED THE OLD HEBREW BIBLE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE JEWISH SCRIBES HAD NOT BEEN CONTENT WITH TAKING THE WORD OF GOD JUST AS IT STOOD THEY HAD BEGUN EVEN IN OUR LORD'S DAY
PATRICIA WAS THE APPLE OF UNCLE JOHN'S EYE AND THE ONE GODDESS ENSHRINED IN HER DOTING FATHER'S HEART GLANCING AT HER
HE WANTED CAPITAL TO PATENT THE PUMP AND PUT IT ON THE MARKET THE THING LOOKED PRETTY GOOD JOHN SO I LENT HIM A THOUSAND OF YOUR MONEY QUITE RIGHT RETURNED UNCLE JOHN NODDING BUT PRETTY SOON HE CAME BACK WITH A SAD TALE
BUT HE TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO HARNESS THE HORSE LOUISE STOOD WATCHING HIM YOUR FINGERS ARE QUITE NIMBLE THOMAS CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT YOU WERE ONCE A SAILOR SHE SAID BUT SAILORS HAVE TO BE NIMBLE MISS HE RETURNED
JUST AT PRESENT TO SEE HOW CRASWELLER BEARS IT WHAT HAS ALL THAT TO DO WITH EVA'S MARRIAGE I SUPPOSE I MIGHT MARRY HER BUT HE HASN'T MADE ANY WILL WHAT DOES THAT MATTER THERE IS NOBODY TO INTERFERE WITH EVA BUT HE MIGHT GO OFF MISTER NEVERBEND
THE BIRTHS AS THEY OCCURRED THE READER WILL SEE HOW IMPORTANT AS TIME WENT ON IT WOULD BECOME TO HAVE AN ACCURATE RECORD AND I ALREADY THEN FEARED THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME WANT OF FIDELITY AFTER I MYSELF HAD BEEN DEPOSITED
COULD IT BE THAT HE SHOULD BE UNWILLING TO BE DEPOSITED WHEN THE DAY HAD COME COULD IT BE THAT HE SHOULD BE ANXIOUS TO FLY FROM HIS COUNTRY AND HER LAWS JUST AS THE TIME HAD ARRIVED WHEN THOSE LAWS MIGHT OPERATE UPON HIM FOR THE BENEFIT OF THAT COUNTRY
THE VALLEYS WERE FILLED WITH HIS CATTLE AND HE COULD ALWAYS SELL HIS SALMON FOR HALF A CROWN A POUND AND HIS PHEASANTS FOR SEVEN AND SIXPENCE A BRACE EVERYTHING HAD THRIVEN WITH CRASWELLER AND EVERYTHING MUST BELONG TO EVA AS SOON AS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LED INTO THE COLLEGE
ABRAHAM GRUNDLE CAME TO ME AT THE EXECUTIVE HALL AND SAID THAT HE HAD A FEW THINGS TO DISCUSS WITH ME OF IMPORTANCE ABRAHAM WAS A GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN WITH BLACK HAIR AND BRIGHT EYES AND A REMARKABLY HANDSOME MOUSTACHE AND HE WAS ONE
MANY AND MOST INTERESTING WERE THE CONVERSATIONS HELD BETWEEN CRASWELLER AND MYSELF ON THE GREAT SUBJECT WHICH FILLED OUR HEARTS
AND THE MARKING OF HIS BALES IT WOULD BE A PITY SAID TO ME A BRITANNULIST ONE DAY A MAN YOUNGER THAN MYSELF TO LOCK UP OLD CRASWELLER AND LET THE BUSINESS GO INTO THE HANDS OF YOUNG GRUNDLE YOUNG GRUNDLE WILL NEVER KNOW HALF AS MUCH ABOUT SHEEP
WE WERE ARRANGING THAT HE SHOULD BE ATTENDED BY PLEASANT VISITORS TILL WITHIN THE LAST WEEK OR TWO AND I WAS MAKING SPECIAL ALLUSION TO THE LAW WHICH REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD ABANDON ALL CONTROL OF HIS PROPERTY IMMEDIATELY ON HIS ENTERING THE COLLEGE I SUPPOSE HE WOULD DO THAT
IN BRITANNULA AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE SAID MY WIFE I TURNED ALL THIS OVER IN MY MIND BECAUSE THE SLOPES OF LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH ARE VERY ALLURING AND THEY WOULD ALL BELONG TO EVA SO SOON AND THEN IT WOULD BE WELL
AT THESE READINGS GABRIEL CRASWELLER WAS THE FAVOURITE PERFORMER AND IT HAD BEGUN TO BE WHISPERED
YOU COULD NOT HAVE USED MORE OPPROBRIOUS LANGUAGE AND AS TO PUTTING AN END TO HIM YOU MUST I THINK BE IGNORANT OF THE METHOD PROPOSED FOR ADDING HONOUR AND GLORY TO THE LAST MOMENTS IN THIS WORLD OF THOSE DEAR FRIENDS WHOSE HAPPY LOT
IF HE DID FLY WHAT STEP SHOULD WE TAKE NEXT THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW SOUTH WALES WAS HOSTILE TO US ON THE VERY MATTER OF THE FIXED PERIOD AND CERTAINLY WOULD NOT SURRENDER HIM IN OBEDIENCE TO ANY LAW OF EXTRADITION AND
EVA WAS PERFECT IN SYMMETRY IN FEATURES IN COMPLEXION AND IN SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS ALL LANGUAGES ARE THE SAME TO HER BUT THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT HAS BECOME SO COMMON IN BRITANNULA THAT BUT LITTLE IS THOUGHT OF IT
BUT YOU HAVE NOT I SAID AT ALL REALISED THE FEELING OF THE CEREMONY A FEW ILL SPOKEN WORDS SUCH AS THESE YOU HAVE JUST UTTERED WILL DO US MORE HARM IN THE MINDS OF MANY THAN ALL YOUR VOTING WILL HAVE DONE GOOD
AND HOW SELDOM IT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE FIRST MAN TO SCALE THE WALLS OF PREJUDICE AND FORCE HIMSELF INTO THE CITADEL OF REASON BUT THEY HAD NOT YIELDED WHEN THINGS HAD GONE AGAINST THEM AND THOUGH THEY HAD NOT BROUGHT THEIR VISIONS DOWN TO THE PALPABLE TOUCH OF HUMANITY
FOR THE TYRANNICAL SLAVES OF A MODERN MONARCH HAVE TAKEN ME IN THE FLESH AND ARE CARRYING ME OFF TO ENGLAND SO THAT AS THEY SAY ALL THAT NONSENSE OF A FIXED PERIOD MAY DIE AWAY IN BRITANNULA THEY THINK POOR
I AND FATHER AND GRABBE AND POSTLECOTT OUR CHIEF CLERK
HE BEGAN UPON A SUBJECT THAT DISTURBS MY CONSCIENCE VERY MUCH YOUR CONSCIENCE SAID I YES MISTER PRESIDENT I BELIEVE YOU'RE AWARE THAT I AM ENGAGED TO MARRY MISS CRASWELLER IT MAY BE AS WELL TO EXPLAIN HERE
HAD I DARED TO REGARD MYSELF AS THE FOREMOST SPIRIT OF MY AGE AND SHOULD I THUS BE TURNED BACK BY THE HUMAN WEAKNESS OF ONE POOR CREATURE WHO HAD NOT SUFFICIENTLY COLLECTED THE STRENGTH OF HIS HEART TO BE ABLE TO LOOK DEATH IN THE FACE AND TO LAUGH HIM DOWN
HE HAD BEEN COLONEL OF THE CURRICULUM AS THEY NOW CALL THE HEAD BOY BUT EVA HAD NOT THEN CARED FOR COLONELS OF CURRICULUMS BUT HAD THOUGHT MORE OF YOUNG GRUNDLE'S MOUSTACHE MY WIFE DECLARED THAT ALL THAT WAS ALTERED
A PRETTIER SPOT AS IT TURNED OUT FOR THE FATTENING OF BOTH BEEF AND MUTTON AND FOR THE GROWTH OF WOOL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE FOUND EVERYTHING THAT HUMAN NATURE WANTS WAS THERE AT LITTLE CHRISTCHURCH
I THINK I MAY SAY THAT NO RACE SO WELL INFORMED EVER BEFORE SET ITSELF DOWN TO FORM A NEW NATION I AM NOW NEARLY SIXTY YEARS OLD VERY NEARLY FIT FOR THE COLLEGE WHICH
I MAY BE DOOMED BY THE FOOLISH PREJUDICE OF MEN TO DRAG OUT A MISERABLE EXISTENCE AMIDST THE SORROWS AND WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE THOUGH IT MAY NEVER BE GIVEN TO ME TO FEEL THE INEFFABLE COMFORTS OF A TRIUMPHANT DEPOSITION STILL
SHOULD BE ANXIOUS TO THROW OVER THE WHOLE SYSTEM TO PRESERVE THE POOR REMNANT OF HIS LIFE IF HE WOULD DO SO WHO COULD BE EXPECTED TO ABSTAIN IF HE SHOULD PROVE FALSE WHEN THE MOMENT CAME WHO WOULD PROVE TRUE
I AM TOLD KNOWS NOTHING HE HAD IMPORTED PHEASANTS EGGS AND SALMON SPAWN AND YOUNG DEER AND BLACK COCK AND GROUSE AND THOSE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ALDERNEY COWS NO BIGGER THAN GOOD SIZED DOGS WHICH WHEN MILKED GIVE NOTHING BUT CREAM
THAT IT WOULD BE WELL THAT I SHOULD SEE CRASWELLER AND TALK TO HIM FREELY ON THE SUBJECT IT HAD SOMETIMES BEEN THAT BY MY STRENGTH I HAD REINVIGORATED HIS HALTING COURAGE
OF YOUTHFUL FEMININE BEAUTY I HAVE NOT YET SEEN THOSE ENGLISH BEAUTIES OF WHICH SO MUCH IS SAID IN THEIR OWN ROMANCES BUT WHOM THE YOUNG MEN FROM NEW YORK AND SAN FRANCISCO WHO MAKE THEIR WAY TO GLADSTONOPOLIS DO NOT SEEM TO ADMIRE VERY MUCH
BUT WHAT CAN I DO I FEAR THAT HE REGARDS THE RICH AS HIS ENEMIES HE IS PINING FOR THE SOLACE OF SOME FRIEND TO WHOM HE COULD TALK FOR SOME EQUAL WITH A MIND EDUCATED LIKE HIS OWN TO WHOSE THOUGHTS HE COULD LISTEN AND TO WHOM HE COULD SPEAK HIS OWN THOUGHTS
BUT ALWAYS WITH A MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EACH OTHER'S TRUTH NOW THEY LIVED COMPARATIVELY NEAR TOGETHER BUT NO OPPORTUNITIES AROSE FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS AT ANY RATE ONCE A QUARTER MISTER CRAWLEY WAS PRESSED BY HIS OLD FRIEND TO VISIT HIM AT THE DEANERY
MOVING A PILE OF RAGGED COVERLESS BOOKS ON TO THE TABLE I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME FOR MOVING THEM THEY ARE NOT BOB'S AT LEAST NOT THE MOST OF THEM BUT MINE SAID THE GIRL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MINE SAID THE BOY AIN'T THEY GRACE
ATONING TO HIS OWN CONSCIENCE FOR PAST SHORTCOMINGS BY PRESENT ZEAL AND THEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO HERSELF THE ABSENCE OF HER DEAR FRIEND LADY LUFTON WAS PERHAPS IN ITSELF NOT DISAGREEABLE MISSUS ROBARTS DID LOVE LADY LUFTON HEARTILY
WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR THAT HE WAS WANTED IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY AT WHICH HIS ATTENDANCE WAS ALWAYS REQUIRED IN HIS PARISH SCHOOL AND THAT ATTENDANCE BEING SO PUNCTUALLY GIVEN THOSE WHO WANTED HIM LOOKED FOR HIM THERE AT THIS HOUR AND IF HE WERE ABSENT DID NOT SCRUPLE TO SEND FOR HIM
WILL YOU SAY THAT I'LL BE OVER ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK YOU HAD BETTER SAY EARLIER AS HE IS ALWAYS OUT ABOUT THE PARISH VERY WELL SAY ELEVEN IT IS PARISH BUSINESS ABOUT WHICH I AM GOING SO IT NEED NOT IRK HIS CONSCIENCE TO STAY IN FOR ME
THEN OLD DAYS WOULD HAVE COME BACK TO THEM BUT NOW ARABIN ALWAYS RIDES ON A SLEEK FINE HORSE NOW A DAYS HE ONCE SAID TO HIS WIFE WITH A SNEER
ON THE DAY AFTER HIS RETURN HE RECEIVED PROPER AUTHENTIC TIDINGS OF HIS PRESENTATION TO THE PREBEND HE WAS IN FACT ALREADY PREBENDARY
I HAVE LEFT A BOOK BEHIND ME HE SAID AND COMING BACK THROUGH THE ROOM HE TOOK UP THE WELL WORN PRAYER BOOK WHICH ACCOMPANIED HIM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS THROUGH THE PARISH BOBBY WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER HAD RETREATED A FEW STEPS BACK AS ALSO DID GRACE WHO TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
HE COULD PROVE WITH THE EASIEST VOICE AND MOST JAUNTY MANNER THAT EVERYTHING WAS QUITE SERENE NOW AT THIS PERIOD HE WAS IN THAT MOOD OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND HE CALLED LOUDLY FOR THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS FOR DANDY AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED
BUT I SHALL INDEED BE SURPRISED IF HE WISHES IT ALSO AND THEN AS SHE FINISHED HER SPEECH LUCY AGAIN FLOGGED THE PONY THIS SHE DID IN VEXATION BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT THE TELL TALE BLOOD HAD SUFFUSED HER FACE WHY LUCY
AND THE SCANTY COMFORT OF THEIR IMPROVED THOUGH STILL WRETCHED INCOME HAD DONE SOMETHING TOWARDS BRINGING HER BACK TO THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD LIVED IN THE SOFT DAYS OF HER CHILDHOOD BUT EVEN THE LIBERAL STIPEND OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
SUCH THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE FOR A MAN THAN FOR A WOMAN FANNY WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED TO ADMIT THIS IN HER OWN HEART BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY ON THAT HEAD I AM SURE I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO BE OF USE TO YOU SHE SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY LOOK UPON ME AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT ME
FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
WENT AWAY WHEN THE SPRING CAME LEAVING THEIR HOUSES INNOCENT AND EMPTY THE PARISH DUTY WAS BETTER ATTENDED TO AND PERHAPS DOMESTIC DUTIES ALSO AT SUCH PERIOD HE WAS A PATTERN PARSON AND A PATTERN HUSBAND
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE WHY PUCK THE PONY WAS BEATEN MARK ROBARTS RETURNED HOME THE DAY AFTER THE SCENE AT THE ALBANY CONSIDERABLY RELIEVED IN SPIRIT
SO THAT LUCY ANXIOUSLY WISHED THAT MISTER CRAWLEY COULD BE GOT RID OF AND THE PRESENTS PRODUCED I HOPE YOU HAVE LEFT MISTER ROBARTS QUITE WELL SAID MISTER CRAWLEY WITH A STIFF CEREMONIAL VOICE
DANDY WAS RATHER A THORN IN HIS SIDE THOSE WRETCHED BILLS WERE TO COME DUE EARLY IN MAY AND BEFORE THE END OF APRIL SOWERBY WROTE TO HIM SAYING THAT HE WAS DOING HIS UTMOST TO PROVIDE FOR THE EVIL DAY
BUT THE MUFF LAY IN HER LAP PONDEROUS WITH ITS RICH ENCLOSURES I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE IN BARCHESTER FOR A PORTION OF THE YEAR NOW SAID MISTER CRAWLEY I REALLY DO NOT KNOW AS YET MARK TALKS OF TAKING LODGINGS FOR HIS FIRST MONTH'S RESIDENCE
WE ARE GOING TO DRIVE OVER TO HOGGLESTOCK THIS MORNING FANNY SAID ONE DAY AT BREAKFAST I SUPPOSE MARK YOU WON'T GO WITH US
MARK THINKS THAT AS HE IS SO NEAR HE NEED NOT BE MUCH ABSENT FROM FRAMLEY EVEN DURING HIS RESIDENCE AND THEN LADY LUFTON IS SO GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AH YES BUT LADY LUFTON IS NOT A CLERGYMAN MISS ROBARTS
OH NO I COULD NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS IN THAT WAY BUT HE WOULD NOT GO HE COULD GO AND LEAVE ME AT HOME SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND I HAVE DONE ALL IN MY POWER TO PERSUADE HIM I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD MIX ONCE MORE WITH THE WORLD WITH THE CLERICAL WORLD YOU KNOW
THEN I REALLY DO THINK THAT HE HAS UNCOMMON BAD TASTE SAID LUCY WITH A REALITY IN HER VOICE DIFFERING MUCH FROM THE TONE OF BANTER SHE HAD HITHERTO USED WHAT LUCY SAID HER SISTER IN LAW LOOKING AT HER
AND THEN SHE IS QUIET AND RESERVED SHE DOES NOT REQUIRE EXCITEMENT AND I AM SURE IS CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DUTIES VERY CONSCIENTIOUS I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID LUCY WITH SOMETHING LIKE A SNEER IN HER TONE BUT THE QUESTION I SUPPOSE IS
IT GALLED HIM HOWEVER TO THINK THAT HE AND HIS WERE SO POORLY DRESSED I AM AFRAID YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A CHAIR MISS ROBARTS SAID MISTER CRAWLEY
HIS NEW DUTIES DO NOT DISTURB HIM MUCH AS YET SAID LUCY AND HIS RIDING OVER HERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE TO HIM YES THERE HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER ME I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NO HORSE
TREATS HERSELF AS A FARMER TREATS HIS SHEEP AND OXEN MAKES HARDLY MORE OF HERSELF OF HER OWN INNER SELF IN WHICH ARE COMPRISED A MIND AND SOUL THAN THE POOR WRETCH OF HER OWN SEX WHO EARNS HER BREAD IN THE LOWEST STAGE OF DEGRADATION
AS FOR HER OWN RAIMENT THE WIVES OF FEW ARTISANS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO PUT UP WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY'S BEST GOWN THE STUFF OF WHICH IT WAS MADE HAD BEEN PAID FOR BY HER MOTHER WHEN SHE WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY BESTOWED UPON HER DAUGHTER HER MODEST WEDDING TROUSSEAU
WAS IN STOPPIN TO EAT OUR LUNCH BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW TO CRY OVER SPILT MILK I DON'T MIND NOT MUCH ANYHOW ASSERTED TROT BRAVELY
HE WOULD SCRAMBLE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND DASH ALONG THE PATH UNTIL A BOARD OR THE BASKET TRIPPED HIM AGAIN
INQUIRED THE THIRD SNUBNOSED ONE BY MEANS OF A MAGIC UMBRELLA WHICH I HAVE CAPTURED AND PUT AWAY IN MY TREASURE CHAMBER REPLIED THE BOOLOOROO
I SPEAK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES AND HAVE HEARD WITH MY OWN EARS PASSING STRANGE BE IT SO I WILL INQUIRE CONCERNING IT ON THE MORROW THE KING REPEATED TO HIS VIZIER WHAT HIS WIFE HAD TOLD HIM
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM AND SPEAK TO HIM VERY WELL SAID THE FARMER I WILL GO AND FIND HIM AND BRING HIM IN TELL HIM FATHER THAT OUR BEAMS ARE STRONG ENOUGH AND THEN HE WILL COME IN
I SHALL CALL YOU OLD MOONFACE REPLIED THE KING FOR THAT SUITS YOU QUITE WELL I SHALL APPOINT YOU THE ROYAL NECTAR MIXER TO THE COURT OF SKY ISLAND AND IF YOU DON'T MIX OUR NECTAR PROPERLY I'LL HAVE YOU PATCHED
STEADILY YET WITH WONDERFUL SWIFTNESS THE END OF THE GREAT BOW DESCENDED UNTIL IT RESTED UPON THE PINK FIELD ALMOST AT THE FEET OF THE LITTLE PARTY OF OBSERVERS THEN THEY SAW DANCING GAILY UPON THE ARCH
YES YES YES OF COURSE THEN ON ENTERING A CERTAIN VILLAGE HE BADE ME TAKE HIS CLASP KNIFE AND GET TWO HORSES WITH IT AND BRING BACK THE KNIFE TO HIM
SHALL BE THE RULER KING OR QUEEN AS LONG AS HE OR SHE LIVES UNLESS SOME ONE OF A LIGHTER SKIN IS FOUND AND THIS RULER'S COMMANDS ALL THE PEOPLE MUST OBEY DO YOU KNOW THIS LAW OH YES REPLIED TOURMALINE
TO WAIT UPON US AND AMUSE US WHEN WE'RE DULL
UNTIL A SIGNAL FROM THE KING AROUSED THEM TO ACTION THE LITTLE GIRL WAS GREATLY SURPRISED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF HER CAPTURE AND SO WAS BUTTON BRIGHT CAP'N BILL SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID HE WAS AFEARED THEY'D GET INTO TROUBLE OUR MISTAKE HE ADDED
HOWEVER HE KEPT HIS THOUGHTS TO HIMSELF PRESENTLY THEY HAD TO WADE THROUGH A STREAM THAT RAN ALONG THE EDGE OF THE CEMETERY THE WATER WAS RATHER DEEP SO THE OLD FARMER TOOK OFF HIS SHOES AND PAJAMAS AND CROSSED OVER BUT THE YOUNG MAN WADED THROUGH IT WITH HIS SHOES AND PAJAMAS ON
BUT LET ME FIRST INQUIRE IF YOU PLEASE WHETHER THE BEAM OF YOUR HOUSE IS STRONG THE OLD FARMER LEFT HIM IN DESPAIR AND ENTERED HIS HOUSE LAUGHING THERE IS A MAN IN YONDER FIELD HE SAID AFTER RETURNING THEIR GREETINGS
AS IT WAS STILL MUDDY UNDERFOOT THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER TOOK A CLOAK FROM ONE OF THE WOMEN PARTLY ROLLED IT AND THREW IT UPON THE GROUND THEN SHE STEPPED UPON IT AND BEGAN WALKING FORWARD THE CLOAK UNROLLED AS SHE ADVANCED AFFORDING A CONSTANT CARPET FOR HER FEET
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS SOME SHARP CONTRAST TO ENHANCE THE CHARM OF YOUR COUNTRY AND TO KEEP THESE THREE PEOPLE WITH YOU WOULD BE A BENEFIT RATHER THAN AN INJURY TO YOU AT THIS THE PINKIES LOOKED DOWNCAST AND ASHAMED
SAID THE OLD MAN TO HIMSELF HOWEVER HE LIKED THE FELLOW AND THINKING THAT HE WOULD AMUSE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER HE INVITED HIM TO COME AND STAY AT HIS HOUSE AS LONG AS HE HAD OCCASION TO REMAIN IN THE VILLAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE YOUNG MAN REPLIED
AND AT SUCH TIMES HE WOULD BE HELPLESS UNTIL TWO OF THE PINKIES WHO WERE A STRONG PEOPLE PULLED HIM OUT AGAIN THE PARROT WAS GETTING ITS FEATHERS SADLY DRAGGLED IN THE RAIN AND THE POOR BIRD SOON PRESENTED A WET AND WOEBEGONE APPEARANCE
IMMEDIATELY ON ARRIVAL HE RAN TO THE PALACE AND INFORMED HIS FATHER OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE POOR VIZIER NOW ALMOST DEAD FROM THE EXPECTATION OF DEATH WAS AT ONCE CARRIED TO THE KING TO WHOM HE REPEATED THE NEWS THAT HIS SON HAD JUST BROUGHT
HALF WAY THE BEARER OF THIS PRESENT AND MESSAGE MET HIS LITTLE SON WHO SEEING WHAT WAS IN THE BASKET BEGGED HIS FATHER TO GIVE HIM SOME OF THE FOOD HIS FATHER FOOLISHLY COMPLIED PRESENTLY HE SAW THE YOUNG MAN AND GAVE HIM THE REST OF THE PRESENT AND THE MESSAGE
OR ELSE TRYING TO PLAY THE FOOL WITH HIM THE YOUNG MAN PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE HIS REPLY AND REMAINED ALMOST SILENT TILL THEY REACHED THE CITY A SHORT DISTANCE OUTSIDE WHICH WAS THE OLD FARMER'S HOUSE
YOU'LL KNOW HOW TO BRING HER TO TIME I IMAGINE HE REMARKED AND IF THE GIRL ISN'T REASONABLE AND OBEDIENT SEND HER TO ME AND I'LL HAVE HER PATCHED NOW THEN TAKE HER AWAY BUT TROT WAS OBSTINATE AND WOULDN'T BUDGE A STEP
AND HELD FAST UNTIL IT WAS UNWOUND AGAIN TROT DECIDED THESE BLUESKINS MUST HAVE STOLEN INTO THE GARDEN WHEN SUMMONED BY THE BELLS THE BOOLOOROO HAD RUNG BUT THEY HAD KEPT OUT OF SIGHT AND CREPT UP BEHIND THE BENCH ON WHICH OUR FRIENDS WERE SEATED
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO KILL US POLLY CAN'T YOU HELP US POLLY WANTS A CRACKER POLLY WANTS A CRACKER SCREECHED THE PARROT
POLYCHROME BEGAN TURNING OVER THE LEAVES WHILE THE OTHERS ALL WATCHED HER ANXIOUSLY AND IN SILENCE HERE SHE SAID PRESENTLY IS A LAW WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS
WHAT A FOOL THE MAN IS THOUGHT THE OLD FARMER PRESENTLY THEY PASSED THROUGH A FIELD OF CORN READY FOR THE SICKLE AND LOOKING LIKE A SEA OF GOLD AS IT WAVED TO AND FRO IN THE BREEZE IS THIS EATEN OR NOT SAID THE YOUNG MAN
GIVE YOUR MISTRESS MY SALAAM HE REPLIED AND TELL HER THAT THE MOON IS NEW AND THAT I CAN FIND ONLY ELEVEN MONTHS IN THE YEAR AND THE SEA IS BY NO MEANS FULL
THE OTHER END HAD BEEN HIDDEN IN THE CLOUDS AND NOW THE RAINBOW BEGAN TO FADE GRADUALLY LIKE MIST AND THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND SHOT ITS CHEERING RAYS OVER THE PINK COUNTRY UNTIL PRESENTLY THE RAINBOW HAD VANISHED ALTOGETHER
YOU WERE SALUTED BY KIND FRIENDS AND PROVIDED WITH BREAD TRUE TRUE SAID THE ASTONISHED FARMER
AND BADE HIM INVESTIGATE THE MATTER AND BE READY WITH A SATISFACTORY ANSWER WITHIN SIX MONTHS ON PAIN OF DEATH THE VIZIER PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST THOUGH HE FELT ALMOST CERTAIN OF FAILURE
TO KNOW THAT HIS MAJESTY WOULD NOT GO BACK FROM HIS THREAT AMONG OTHER THINGS HE ADVISED HIS SON TO TRAVEL FOR A TIME UNTIL THE KING'S ANGER SHOULD HAVE SOMEWHAT COOLED THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO WAS BOTH CLEVER AND HANDSOME
HE ISN'T A FIT COMPANION FOR YOU NOT THAT THE POOR LITTLE UNFORTUNATE IS TO BLAME HE CANNOT HELP BEING A CHILD OF THE SLUMS AND HE MUST BE PUT IN AN ORPHAN ASYLUM OR A REFORM SCHOOL AT ONCE
OF HEARING THE BOSS SWEAR AT HIM TO BE QUICK AND FOLLOW HIM OR HE WOULD BE BURNED TO DEATH THEN THERE HAD BEEN AN AWFUL MOMENT OF GROPING THROUGH THE BLINDING CHOKING SMOKE TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT THE MAN SPRANG TO A WINDOW AND MADE HIS ESCAPE
VIRGINIA CAME FLYING DOWN THE STEPS WHITE AS A LITTLE GHOST
COULDN'T YOU RAISE ANY MORE MONEY THAN THAT IT WAS MALCOLM'S TURN TO SHAKE HIS HEAD HE TURNED AWAY TOO DISAPPOINTED TO TRUST HIMSELF TO ANSWER ANY OTHER WAY THE TEARS SPRANG TO KEITH'S EYES
WITH A FINAL LOVING PAT I GUESS HE'LL NOT MIND THOUGH MAYBE HE'LL THINK HE IS IN THE WOODS IF I PUT THIS GOOD SMELLING PINE PILLOW ON THE RUG BESIDE HIM OH BOYS CALLED VIRGINIA FROM THE HALL DOWN STAIRS
I WISH WE HAD ONE IT'S NICER THAN ANY PETS WE EVER HAD EXCEPT THE PONIES SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENED TO THE DOGS AND THE MONKEY WAS SUCH A NUISANCE AND THE WHITE RABBITS WERE STOLEN AND THE GUINEA PIGS DIED
I MUST MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIM TO BE PUT INTO ONE AS SOON AS HE IS ABLE TO BE MOVED I THINK HE WILL BE VERY LOATH TO LEAVE THE OLD PROFESSOR ANSWERED MISS ALLISON HE HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO THE CHILD AMUSING HIM BY THE HOUR WITH HIS MICROSCOPES
WHEN THEY REACHED THE TOP OF THE STAIRS VIRGINIA WENT INTO HER ROOM TO LIGHT A WAX TAPER IN ONE OF THE TALL SILVER CANDLESTICKS ON HER DRESSING TABLE I THINK THAT AUNT ALLISON MUST HAVE LEFT THOSE ARROWS IN THE BLUE ROOM SHE SAID
IT WAS IN A BRIGHT NEW TIN PAN AND ITS DAINTILY BROWNED CRUST WOULD HAVE MADE THEM HUNGRY EVEN IF THEIR APPETITES HAD NOT BEEN SHARPENED BY THE COLD AND EXERCISE OF THE AFTERNOON WHAT A QUEER PLACE TO SERVE PIE SAID MALCOLM
I'M AFRAID THE BOSS WILL FIND OUT THAT I'M HERE HE STARTED TO THE STORE FOR SOME TOBACCO AS SOON AS YOU LEFT HE'S BEEN WILD FER SOME BUT DIDN'T HAVE NO MONEY DON'T YOU LEAVE THAT BEAR OUT HERE TO NIGHT IF YOU EVER EXPECT TO SEE IT AGAIN
IT SHONE FULL ACROSS THE WINDOW OF VIRGINIA'S ROOM BUT SHE WAS DREAMING OF BEING CHASED BY BEARS AND ONLY TURNED UNEASILY IN HER SLEEP THE OLD PROFESSOR ON HIS WAY TO THE KITCHEN NOTICED THAT IT SEEMED STRANGELY LIGHT OUTSIDE
THE GUESTS CAME PROMPTLY THEY HAD BEEN INVITED FOR HALF PAST SIX AND DINNER WAS TO BE SERVED SOON AFTER THAT TIME THE LAST TO ARRIVE WAS THE LITTLE COLONEL SHE CAME IN CHARGE OF AN OLD COLOURED WOMAN MOM BECK
I'VE RAISED THAT BEAR FROM THE TIME IT WAS A TEENY CUB I'VE TAUGHT IT AND FED IT AND LOOKED TO IT FOR COMPANY WHEN I HADN'T NOBODY IN THE WORLD TO CARE FOR ME COULDN'T SELL THAT BEAR FOR NO SUCH SUM AS THAT
STILL SHE DID NOT CARE TO TAKE UNC HENRY INTO HER CONFIDENCE THE FOOD THE WARMTH AND THE NIGHT'S REST HAD SO RESTORED THE BEAR THAT IT WAS ABLE TO GO THROUGH ALL ITS PERFORMANCES FOR THE BOYS ENTERTAINMENT ALTHOUGH IT LIMPED BADLY
LEST SOME STRAY SPARK SHOULD BE BLOWN TOWARD THE OTHER BUILDINGS DIS YERE OLE NIGGAH WA'N'T MISTAKEN AFTAH ALL HE MUTTERED
WE CAN HIDE HIM AWAY IN THE BARN IT IS SO DARK OUT DOORS NOW THAT NOBODY WILL SEE US IT WOULDN'T SEEM LIKE HE IS REALLY OURS IF WE COULDN'T TAKE HIM WITH US AFTER SOME GRUMBLING THE MAN CONSENTED AND POCKETED THE FOUR DOLLARS
SHE HAD A HORROR OF TRAMPS BUT THE BOYS BEGGED HER TO WAIT UNTIL DAYLIGHT FOR JONESY'S SAKE THE MAN WILL BEAT HIM IF HE FINDS OUT THAT JONESY WARNED US PLEADED KEITH HE WAS SO EARNEST THAT THE TEARS STOOD IN HIS BIG TRUSTFUL EYES
AND IT WILL BE PLENTY WARM FOR A BEAR IF WE TURN ON THE FURNACE A LITTLE AS HE SPOKE HE WAS TYING THE BEAR'S ROPE AROUND A LEG OF THE BIG HIGH POSTED BED WON'T GINGER BE SURPRISED ANSWERED KEITH
FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER THAT MADE EVERY ONE DOWN STAIRS TURN PALE WITH FRIGHT TWO VOICES WERE UTTERING PIERCING SHRIEKS ONE AFTER ANOTHER SO LOUD AND FRANTIC THAT EVEN THE SERVANTS IN THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE CAME RUNNING
VIRGINIA PLEASED TO HAVE CAUGHT THEM SO CLEVERLY SHOWED THEM THE ENDS OF TWENTY FOUR PIECES OF NARROW RIBBON PEEPING FROM UNDER THE DELICATELY BROWN TOP CRUST THE WHITE ONES ARE FOR THE GIRLS
FOR FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW HE FOUND SOME TRACKS PRESENTLY AND FOLLOWED THEM OVER THE MEADOW IN THE STARLIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD AND DOWN THE RAILROAD TRACK SEVERAL RODS THERE THEY SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
BY THE TIME THEY WERE DRESSED THEY HAD DECIDED TO PUT IT IN THE BLUE ROOM A GUEST CHAMBER IN THE NORTH WING SELDOM USED IN WINTER BECAUSE IT WAS SO HARD TO HEAT NOBODY WILL EVER THINK OF COMING IN HERE SAID MALCOLM
TURNING A HANDSPRING IN THE SNOW TO SHOW HIS DELIGHT COME ON WE'LL ASK THE MAN NOW BUT THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD WHEN THEY DASHED INTO THE CABIN AND TOLD THEIR ERRAND
THERE IS A VALENTINE ON THE END OF EACH ONE AND THOSE ON THE RED RIBBONS MATCH THE ONES ON THE WHITE WE'LL ALL PULL AT ONCE AND THE ONES WHO HAVE VALENTINES ALIKE
AND MY LITTLE NEPHEWS BROUGHT HIM HERE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF HIM THE PROFESSOR WAVED HER ASIDE LIFTING JONESY'S HEAD AS TENDERLY AS A NURSE COULD HAVE DONE AND MOTIONED THE COLOURED MEN TO LIFT HIM UP
MAYBE IF JONESY HAD BEEN AN ATTRACTIVE CHILD WITH A SENSITIVE MOUTH AND BIG APPEALING EYES HE MIGHT HAVE FOUND HIS WAY MORE EASILY INTO PEOPLE'S HEARTS BUT HE WAS A LEAN SNUB NOSED LITTLE FELLOW
SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT MALCOLM FOUND THE TRAMP'S PICTURE IN THE COURIER JOURNAL HE WAS A NOTED CRIMINAL WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM A NORTHERN PENITENTIARY SOME TWO MONTHS BEFORE AND HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE LOUISVILLE POLICE
AND THE BEAR OBLIGINGLY WENT THROUGH ALL HIS TRICKS HE WAS USED TO BEING PULLED OUT TO PERFORM WHENEVER A CROWD COULD BE COLLECTED VIRGINIA FORGOT HER FEAR OF HIM WHEN HE STOOD UP AND PRESENTED ARMS LIKE A REAL SOLDIER
THE WAY FROM THE LAWN INTO THE HOUSE THROUGH THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW WAS NOT AS YET OPEN AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO GO ROUND BY THE KITCHEN GARDEN ON TO THE ROAD AND THENCE IN BY THE FRONT DOOR OR ELSE TO PASS THROUGH THE BACK DOOR AND INTO THE HOUSE BY THE KITCHEN
BUT IT IS AS WELL THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE MEANS OF JUDGING THAT OTHER MAN WAS A VILLAIN THIS MAN IS HONEST WOULD IT NOT BE WELL THAT SHE SHOULD LEARN TO LIKE HIM SHE ALWAYS DID LIKE HIM I THOUGHT BEFORE THAT OTHER FELLOW CAME DOWN HERE AMONG US
LILY HAD EXACTED A PROMISE FROM HER MOTHER BEFORE HER ILLNESS AND DURING THE PERIOD OF HER CONVALESCENCE OFTEN REFERRED TO IT REMINDING HER MOTHER THAT THAT PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE AND MUST BE KEPT
HE HAS MADE THAT LADY HIS WIFE I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS THEM AND I PRAY THAT THEY MAY BE HAPPY AS SHE SPOKE THESE WORDS THERE WAS AN UNWONTED SOLEMNITY IN HER TONE WHICH STARTLED MISSUS DALE AND BELL
OH AT ALL MANNER OF HOURS ANY TIME BEFORE TWELVE THEY WILL BE FASHIONABLE AND WILL BE MARRIED LATE YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S MISSUS CROSBIE YET THEN LADY ALEXANDRINA CROSBIE SAID BELL SHUDDERING YES
HOW DIFFERENT HAD IT BEEN WHEN CROSBIE HAD MADE HIS OFFER LILY FOR THE TIME HAD BEEN RAISED TO A PINNACLE A PINNACLE WHICH MIGHT BE DANGEROUS BUT WHICH WAS AT ANY RATE LOFTY WITH WHAT A PRETTY SPEECH HAD CROSBIE BEEN GREETED
BUT EVEN AS INVOLUNTARY EJACULATIONS WERE VERY IMPROPER MISSUS DALE HEARD THEM AND WAS NOT OFFENDED EITHER BY THEIR IMPROPRIETY OR THEIR WARMTH BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SHE SAID THAT SHE CANNOT BRING HERSELF TO GO THERE
THAT HE COULD NOT DISCUSS THE SUBJECT WITH HER SEEING THAT HE HAD BEEN SPECIALLY INFORMED BY MISSUS DALE THAT HIS INTERFERENCE WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED AND THEN HE WAS PERHAPS AWARE THAT IF HE DID DISCUSS THE SUBJECT WITH BELL HE WOULD NOT GAIN MUCH BY SUCH DISCUSSION
NO YOU MAY NOT AS IF I HADN'T KNOWN IT ALL ALONG AND WASN'T IT HARD TO BEAR THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SCOLDED ME WITH SUCH PERTINACIOUS AUSTERITY
IN THE FIRST MONTH OR TWO THEY WERE TO LIVE IN LODGINGS AND THEIR GOODS WERE TO BE STORED IN SOME FRIENDLY WAREHOUSE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD IT NOT BE WELL
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MAMMA YOU MAY HAVE SOME COMFORT IN THIS THAT WHEN TO DAY'S GONE BY I SHAN'T MAKE A FUSS ABOUT ANY OTHER DAY NOBODY THINKS THAT YOU ARE MAKING A FUSS LILY YES BUT I AM ISN'T IT ODD BELL
SAID BELL BECAUSE IF WE ARE ILL HE WON'T HAVE SUCH A TERRIBLE DISTANCE TO COME THAT WILL BE A COMFORT FOR HIM I SHOULD THINK SAID BELL VERY DEMURELY IN THE EVENING THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HAD BEEN PROCURED
IT IS ARRANGED APPARENTLY THAT THE INJURER SHALL BE PUNISHED BUT THAT THE PERSON INJURED SHALL NOT GRATIFY HIS DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE AND WILL YOU GO TO GUESTWICK YOURSELF ASKED MISSUS DALE I WILL TAKE THE NOTE SAID THE SQUIRE
THAT WOULD BE HARDLY POSSIBLE SAID MISSUS DALE IT ONLY WANTS THREE WEEKS AND WITH THE HOUSE IN SUCH A CONDITION JAMES IS JOKING SAID BELL I WAS NOT JOKING AT ALL SAID THE DOCTOR
BUT LILY WOULD NOT HAVE IT AVOIDED FOR THEM IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT MATTER ON WHICH TO SPEAK IN HER HEARING IT WAS NOT PERMITTED TO THEM TO SAY A WORD OF ABUSE AGAINST CROSBIE AS TO WHOM THEY THOUGHT THAT NO WORD OF CONDEMNATION COULD BE SUFFICIENTLY SEVERE
BUT WE WILL NOT TALK ABOUT IT AH BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT IT WAS AS I HAVE SAID AND IF SO YOU SHOULDN'T HATE HIM BECAUSE HE DID THE ONLY THING WHICH HE HONESTLY COULD DO WHEN HE FOUND OUT HIS MISTAKE
STRIVING TO THINK GOOD AND NOT EVIL THESE WERE KIND LOVING WORDS SHOWING IN THEMSELVES A SPIRIT OF LOVE AND FORBEARANCE BUT THEY WERE SPOKEN IN A HARSH UNSYMPATHIZING VOICE AND THE SPEAKER AS HE UTTERED THEM LOOKED GLOOMILY AT THE FIRE
THAT LILY WAS UNABLE TO GO OUT SO SOON AFTER HER ILLNESS AND THAT SHE HERSELF WAS OBLIGED TO STAY WITH LILY SHE EXPLAINED ALSO THAT THE BUSINESS OF MOVING WAS IN HAND AND THAT THEREFORE SHE COULD NOT HERSELF ACCEPT THE INVITATION
THOSE WHO OFFEND US ARE GENERALLY PUNISHED FOR THE OFFENCE THEY GIVE BUT WE SO FREQUENTLY MISS THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT WE ARE AVENGED
AND THEY WERE FORCED TO LISTEN TO SUCH EXCUSES FOR HIS CONDUCT AS LILY CHOSE TO MANUFACTURE NEVER DARING TO POINT OUT HOW VAIN THOSE EXCUSES WERE INDEED IN THOSE DAYS LILY REIGNED AS A QUEEN AT THE SMALL HOUSE
I THINK I'LL READ PILGRIM'S PROGRESS AGAIN
THAT I GAVE MYSELF UP TO HIM ALL AT ONCE WITHOUT GIVING HIM A CHANCE OF THINKING OF IT IN A WEEK OR TWO IT WAS DONE WHO COULD EXPECT THAT SUCH AN ENGAGEMENT SHOULD BE LASTING AND WHY NOT THAT IS NONSENSE LILY
SHE HAS GOT ON YOUR OLD CHECKED APRON AND WHEN HE CAME IN SHE WAS ROLLING UP THE FIRE IRONS IN BROWN PAPER I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE WAS EVER IN SUCH A MESS BEFORE THERE'S ONE THING CERTAIN HE CAN'T KISS HER HAND IT'S YOU ARE THE GOOSE LILY
THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WHAT WE CALL CHRISTIANITY SEEMS TO ME TO BE HARDLY POSSIBLE WHEN YOUR FOOT GOES IN THAT WAY IT IS A VERY UNCHRISTIAN FOOT AND YOU OUGHT TO KEEP IT STILL IT MEANS ANGER AGAINST HIM
THAT IT SHOULD TAKE PLACE ON VALENTINE'S DAY
WHY NOT SEND FOR MISTER BOYCE AND CARRY HER OFF AT ONCE ON A PILLION BEHIND YOU SAID LILY IT'S JUST THE SORT OF THING FOR PRIMITIVE PEOPLE TO DO LIKE YOU AND BELL ALL THE SAME BELL I DO WISH YOU COULD HAVE BEEN MARRIED FROM THIS HOUSE
BUT IT IS DONE AND WE CANNOT NOW GO BACK SHE LOVES HIM YET AS DEARLY AS SHE EVER LOVED HIM THEN THE SQUIRE MUTTERED CERTAIN WORDS BELOW HIS BREATH EJACULATIONS AGAINST CROSBIE WHICH WERE HARDLY VOLUNTARY
DON'T YOU THINK WE MIGHT GO IN OR WOULD IT BE ILL NATURED LILY DON'T BE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO SAY ANYTHING YOU MAY BE MISTAKEN YOU KNOW AND THERE'S MANY A SLIP BETWEEN THE CUP AND THE LIP YES MAMMA THERE IS SAID LILY
I DON'T REMEMBER THE AUSTERITY SAID MISSUS DALE NOR YET LILY'S SILENCE SAID BELL BUT IT'S ALL SETTLED NOW SAID LILY AND I'M DOWNRIGHT HAPPY I NEVER FELT MORE SATISFACTION NEVER BELL NOR DID I SAID HER MOTHER
SAID HE WE FIND THAT WE CAN'T CROSS THIS DESERT WHICH TURNS ALL LIVING FLESH THAT TOUCHES IT INTO DUST SO I HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME AND HELP US JOHNNY DOOIT PUFFED HIS PIPE
THE UNIT WAS THE STAR PIECE THE STELLY WHEN HE ASKED TO SEE SOME OF IT THEY WERE INDIGNANT NOBODY CARRIED MONEY WASN'T MASTERLY A MASTER NEVER EVEN TOUCHED THE STUFF THAT WAS WHAT SLAVES WERE FOR
THAN THAT DATE PUFF YESTERDAY NOON BERTRAM LAUGHED AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS MY DEAR LOVE I'M NOT QUESTIONING YOUR ABILITY TO DO IT HE SOOTHED QUICKLY STILL HE ADDED WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE
BERTRAM FROWNED FOR A MINUTE HE LOOKED AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO TAKE UP THE MATTER SERIOUSLY AND ARGUE IT WITH HER BUT THE NEXT MOMENT HE SMILED AND TOSSED HIS HEAD WITH JAUNTY PLAYFULNESS BERTRAM TO TELL THE TRUTH
HE KNOCKED THE ASHES FROM HIS PIPE AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET THEN HE UNLOCKED THE COPPER CHEST AND LIFTED THE LID AND DOROTHY SAW IT WAS FULL OF SHINING TOOLS OF ALL SORTS AND SHAPES JOHNNY DOOIT MOVED QUICKLY NOW
IT MEANT THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION
SO THE HUNGRY ADVENTURERS SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES PROVIDED WITH PLENTY TO EAT AND TO DRINK THEY LOST NO TIME IN PICKING THE BIGGEST STRAWBERRIES AND RIPEST ORANGES AND SOON HAD FEASTED TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU WHERE DID YOU GET THAT DONKEY HEAD REALLY I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN YOU AT ALL SHAGGY MAN IF I HADN'T LOOKED AT YOUR FEET THE SHAGGY MAN INTRODUCED JOHNNY DOOIT TO DOROTHY AND TOTO AND BUTTON BRIGHT AND THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER
WITH NOT A THING TO EAT YET THEY ALL GOT DINNER THEN TOGETHER WITH MANY A SIGH AND QUICK COMING TEAR AS EVERYWHERE THEY MET SOME SAD REMINDER OF THE GENTLE OLD HANDS THAT WOULD NEVER AGAIN MINISTER TO THEIR COMFORT
WHEN BILLY WENT UP STAIRS THAT NIGHT SHE RAN ACROSS HER TALK TO YOUNG WIVES IN HER DESK WITH A HALF STIFLED CRY SHE THRUST IT FAR BACK OUT OF SIGHT I HATE YOU I HATE YOU
AND SOME SILVER SHOES BROUGHT ME BACK AGAIN IN HALF A SECOND THEN OZMA TOOK ME OVER ON HER MAGIC CARPET AND THE NOME KING'S MAGIC BELT TOOK ME HOME THAT TIME
SO QUICKLY THAT THEY WERE ASTONISHED AT THE WORK HE WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH HE HAD IN HIS CHEST A TOOL FOR EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO DO AND THESE MUST HAVE BEEN MAGIC TOOLS BECAUSE THEY DID THEIR WORK SO FAST AND SO WELL
NO PLANETARY GOVERNMENT SHALL MAKE WAR ENTER INTO ANY ALLIANCE TAX REGULATE OR RESTRAIN INTERSTELLAR TRADE OR COMMUNICATION EVERY SAPIENT BEING SHALL BE EQUALLY PROTECTED
THEN HE CAME TO ARTICLE SIX HE CLEARED HIS THROAT RAISED HIS VOICE AND READ THERE SHALL BE NO CHATTEL SLAVERY OR SERFDOM ANYWHERE IN THE EMPIRE NO SAPIENT BEING OF ANY RACE WHATSOEVER
WRITING STAMMERED BILLY STILL HALF UNDER HER BREATH OF COURSE YOU HAVEN'T TRIUMPHED BERTRAM YOU'VE BEEN TOO DEAD TIRED AND THAT'S JUST WHAT I SAY BILLY YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL YOURSELF BUT I WANT TO
AND THE CONCERTS YOU'D LOSE BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO DEAD TIRED TO GO TO THEM YOU KNOW HOW IT WAS WITH THAT CONCERT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WHICH ALICE GREGGORY WANTED YOU TO GO TO WITH HER I DIDN'T WANT TO GO CHOKED BILLY UNDER HER BREATH
A FEW LOOKED APPREHENSIVELY AT THE CEILING AS THOUGH EXPECTING THE HELLBURNERS AND PLANET BUSTERS AND NEGA MATTER BOMBS AT ANY MOMENT THEN ONE OF THE MEMBERS AMONG THE BENCHES ROSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO IT PRINCE TREVANNION HE SAID
SECTION ONE THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE EMPIRE THE ABSOLUTE POWERS OF THE EMPEROR THE RULES OF SUCCESSION THE EMPEROR ALSO TO BE PLANETARY KING OF ODIN SECTION TWO
SHALL BE THE PROPERTY OF ANY BEING BUT HIMSELF THE CONVOCATION CHAMBER WAS SILENT LIKE A BOMB WITH A DEFECTIVE FUSE FOR ALL OF THIRTY SECONDS
ALWAYS FOR EVERMORE THEY WOULD BURN DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO HER SOUL AND NOT ONCE IN ALL BERTRAM'S APOLOGIES HAD HE REFERRED TO THEM THOSE WORDS HE HAD UTTERED HE HAD NOT SAID HE DID NOT MEAN THEM
ASKED THE SHAGGY MAN LOOKING ALL AROUND HIM I'LL MAKE YOU ONE SAID JOHNNY DOOIT AS HE SPOKE
BUT THAT HER EARS WERE ONLY SEEMINGLY AND NOT REALLY DEAF WAS SHOWN VERY CLEARLY A LITTLE LATER WHEN AT A PARTICULARLY ABJECT WAIL ON THE PART OF THE BABBLING SHADOW AT HER HEELS BILLY CHOKED INTO A LITTLE GASP
IT OUGHT TO BE PAINTED SAID JOHNNY DOOIT TOSSING HIS TOOLS BACK INTO THE CHEST FOR THAT WOULD MAKE IT LOOK PRETTIER BUT THOUGH I CAN PAINT IT FOR YOU IN THREE SECONDS IT WOULD TAKE AN HOUR TO DRY AND THAT'S A WASTE OF TIME
EVERY PLANETARY GOVERNMENT TO BE SOVEREIGN IN ITS OWN INTERNAL AFFAIRS ONLY ONE SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT UPON ANY PLANET OR WITHIN NORMAL SPACE TRAVEL DISTANCE ALL HYPERSPACE SHIPS AND ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS
BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD SUIT ME BETTER THAN DANCING ON RAINBOWS I'M FRAID THEY'D BE KIND OF SOFT AN SQUASHY UNDER FOOT ANYHOW ALTHOUGH THEY'RE SO PRETTY TO LOOK AT THIS DIDN'T HELP TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
THAT NEED NOT BE TOO IMMEDIATE THEN I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU SET UP SOME AGENCY TO HANDLE ALL THE DETAILS AND AS SOON AS YOU HAVE ENACTED THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY WHICH SHOULD BE THIS AFTERNOON
MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW IT BUT THERE ARE TWENTY MILLION SLAVES ON THIS PLANET LOOK YOU CAN'T FREE SLAVES THAT'S RIDICULOUS A SLAVE'S A SLAVE WHO'LL DO THE WORK AND WHO WOULD THEY BELONG TO THEY'D HAVE TO BELONG TO SOMEBODY
AND ONE CAN'T FORGIVE WITHOUT FORGETTING SO THERE HE FINISHED WITH A SMILINGLY DETERMINED NOW EVERYTHING IS JUST AS IT WAS BEFORE AIR BILLY MADE NO RESPONSE
SMALL AND UNPRETENTIOUS BAR ROOMS WHICH ARE REALLY MALE BROTHELS
WHEN HE ONCE SAW A SCHOOLFELLOW COPULATING WITH A LITTLE GIRL IT GAVE HIM A SENSE OF MYSTICAL HORROR NOR DID THE SIGHT OF THE MALE ORGANS AROUSE ANY PARTICULAR SENSATIONS HE IS HOWEVER OF OPINION THAT LIVING WITH HIS SISTERS IN CHILDHOOD
THESE SECOND VISIONS TOOK THE FORM OF THE LARGE ERECT ORGANS OF NAKED YOUNG GROOMS OR PEASANTS THESE GROSS VISIONS OFFENDED HIS TASTE AND HURT HIM THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME THEY EVOKED A STRONG ACTIVE DESIRE FOR POSSESSION HE TOOK A STRANGE POETIC PLEASURE IN THE IDEAL FORM
ON ONE OCCASION THE CHILD ACCIDENTALLY OBSERVED A BOY WHO SAT NEXT TO HIM IN SCHOOL PLAYING WITH HIS PENIS AND CARESSING IT THIS GAVE HIM A POWERFUL UNEASY SENSATION
IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO ARGUE THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS INCREASED IF WE CAN BELIEVE THAT IN WOMEN ALSO THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE PERSISTS EVEN WHEN ITS OUTWARD MANIFESTATIONS NO LONGER OCCUR
HE THINKS THIS TREATMENT EXAGGERATED HIS NEUROSIS ALL THIS TIME NO KIND OF SEXUAL FEELING FOR GIRLS MADE ITSELF FELT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS FOUND IN WOMEN OR THE STORIES THEY TOLD ABOUT WANTONNESS AND DELIGHT OF COITUS
EXCESSIVE SHYNESS AND RELIGIOUS DISQUIETUDE
BUT THE SEMINAL LOSSES WHICH ACCOMPANIED BOTH KINDS OF DREAMS WERE A PERPETUAL SOURCE OF MISERY TO HIM THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT AT THIS TIME THAT IS BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH YEARS A HOMOSEXUAL DIATHESIS HAD BECOME ESTABLISHED
GERMANS USUALLY DENY HOWEVER THAT THERE IS ANY SPECIAL GERMAN PROCLIVITY TO INVERSION AND IT WOULD NOT APPEAR THAT SUCH STATISTICS AS ARE AVAILABLE THOUGH ALL SUCH STATISTICS CANNOT BE REGARDED AS MORE THAN APPROXIMATIONS SHOW ANY PRONOUNCED PREDOMINANCE OF INVERSION AMONG GERMANS
HE BELONGS TO A FAMILY WHO ARE ALL HEALTHY AND HAVE SHOWN MARKED ABILITY IN DIFFERENT INTELLECTUAL DEPARTMENTS
AFTER THEY HAD SLEPT TOGETHER THE FEELING OF THE PENIS PLEASED HIM WHEN SLEEPING WITH ANOTHER COUSIN THEY USED TO LIE WITH HANDS OUTSTRETCHED TO COVER EACH OTHER'S PENIS OR NATES HE PREFERRED THE NATES BUT HIS COUSIN THE PENIS
SINCE HE YIELDED FREELY TO HIS INCLINATIONS THE MEN HE HAS SOUGHT ARE INVARIABLY PERSONS OF A LOWER SOCIAL RANK THAN HIS OWN HE CARRIED ON ONE LIAISON CONTINUOUSLY FOR TWELVE YEARS IT BEGAN WITHOUT PASSION ON THE FRIEND'S SIDE BUT GRADUALLY GREW TO NEARLY EQUAL STRENGTH ON BOTH SIDES
MEANWHILE HIS HOMOSEXUAL EMOTIONS STRENGTHENED AND ASSUMED A MORE SENSUAL CHARACTER HE ABSTAINED FROM INDULGING THEM AS ALSO FROM ONANISM
WITH REGARD TO ALL THESE POINTS THE SUBJECT OBSERVES THAT NONE OF THE BOYS WITH WHOM HE WAS CONNECTED AT THIS PERIOD AND WHO WERE EXPOSED TO PRECISELY THE SAME INFLUENCES BECAME HOMOSEXUAL HE WAS HIMSELF FROM THE FIRST INDIFFERENT TO THE OPPOSITE SEX
BUT HE WAS OFTEN FORCED WITH SHAME AND RELUCTANCE TO FREQUENT PLACES BATHS URINARIES AND SO FORTH WHERE THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES OF SEEING NAKED MEN HAVING NO PASSION FOR WOMEN IT WAS EASY TO AVOID THEM YET THEY INSPIRED HIM WITH NO EXACT HORROR
IN BOYHOOD HE HAD NO LIKING FOR FEMALE OCCUPATIONS OR FOR THE SOCIETY OF GIRLS PREFERRING STUDY AND SOLITUDE HE AVOIDED GAMES AND THE NOISY OCCUPATIONS OF BOYS BUT WAS ONLY NON MASCULINE IN HIS INDIFFERENCE TO SPORT
IDEAS AND FEELINGS WHICH IN A SLIGHTER AND MORE FRAGMENTARY SHAPE MAY BE PARALLELED IN THE EARLY EXPERIENCES OF MANY NORMAL MEN AND WOMEN BUT IT MUST BE RARE TO FIND SO MANY POINTS IN SEXUAL PSYCHOLOGY SO DEFINITELY ILLUSTRATED IN A SINGLE CHILD
NEITHER OF THESE COUSINS WAS HOMOSEXUAL AND THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT AT MUTUAL MASTURBATION HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF PLAYING WITH FIVE MALE COUSINS ONE OF THESE BOYS WAS UNPOPULAR WITH THE OTHERS AND THEY INVENTED A METHOD OF PUNISHING HIM FOR SUPPOSED OFFENSES
HE NEVER YIELDS HIMSELF TO THE OTHER AND HE ASSERTS THAT HE NEVER HAS THE JOY OF FINDING HIMSELF DESIRED WITH ARDOR EQUAL TO HIS OWN HE DOES NOT SHRINK FROM PASSIVE PEDICATIO BUT IT IS NEVER DEMANDED OF HIM
THE INVERT RISKS BEING BLACKMAILED OR ROBBED IF HE GOES HOME OR TO A HOTEL WITH A CAFE ACQUAINTANCE
IN THE STATES SEEM TO BE IN A LARGE PROPORTION ASSOCIATED WITH HOMOSEXUALITY
HIRSCHFELD THOUGH SO ACUTE AND EXPERIENCED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY STATES THAT WHEN VISITING PHILADELPHIA AND BOSTON HE COULD SCARCELY DETECT ANY EVIDENCE OF HOMOSEXUALITY
SOME CENTURIES AT LEAST INQUISITIVE OBSERVERS HERE AND THERE HAVE THOUGHT THEY FOUND REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN PRESENT VARIOUS SIGNS OF A MENSTRUAL PHYSIOLOGICAL CYCLE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO COLLECT A NUMBER OF OPINIONS IN FAVOR OF SUCH A MONTHLY PHYSIOLOGICAL PERIODICITY IN MEN
WHICH IN THIS RESPECT IS HELD TO BE DISTINCT FROM NORTHERN ITALY
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE UNDOUBTED FACT THAT HOMOSEXUALITY IS LESS CONSPICUOUS IN FRANCE AND THE OTHER LATIN COUNTRIES THAN IN TEUTONIC LANDS
IT IS NOT VERY EASY TO SAY IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT IN DEALING WITH A NORTHERN COUNTRY LIKE ENGLAND HOMOSEXUAL PHENOMENA DO NOT PRESENT THEMSELVES IN THE SAME WAY AS THEY DO IN SOUTHERN ITALY TODAY OR IN ANCIENT GREECE
THE NURSERY MAID SNIGGERED AND HE FELT THAT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING PECULIAR ABOUT THE PENIS
SO THAT ANY GIVEN NUMBER OF HOMOSEXUAL PERSONS AMONG THE GREEKS WOULD HAVE PRESENTED A FAR SMALLER PROPORTION OF CONSTITUTIONALLY ABNORMAL INDIVIDUALS THAN A LIKE NUMBER IN ENGLAND IN A SIMILAR MANNER THOUGH I DO NOT REGARD THE ANALOGY AS COMPLETE
NO PLEASURE HE HAS ENJOYED HE DECLARES CAN EQUAL A THOUSANDTH PART OF THE PAIN CAUSED BY THE INTERNAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF PARIAHDOM THE UTMOST HE CAN PLEAD IN HIS OWN DEFENSE HE ADMITS IS IRRESPONSIBILITY
STRIVING TO PUT ASIDE THIS SOURCE OF FALLACY AND ONLY CONSIDERING THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN CONTACT BY THE ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF LIFE AND WITH WHOSE MODES OF FEELING I AM ACQUAINTED I AM STILL LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PROPORTION IS CONSIDERABLE
BUT MAINLY TO GENERAL DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERAMENT
A SIX WEEKLY PERIOD IN ONE CASE AND NOTABLY IN HEMICRANIA OR MIGRAINE BY HARRY CAMPBELL OSLER ET CETERA
AND IN THE LATIN COUNTRIES GENERALLY THAN IN TEUTONIC AND SLAVONIC LANDS
THIS MIN PALMER MUST AT LEAST BE DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE CORNERITES IF ONLY IN THE GREATER FORCE OF HER WICKEDNESS
JEST LET RUN WILD ALL HER LIFE WELL ROD PALMER TOOK TO DANCIN ATTENDANCE ON HER ROD WAS A WORTHLESS SCAMP OLD PALMER WAS WELL OFF AND ROD WAS HIS ONLY CHILD BUT THIS ROSE LIVED THERE AND KEPT HOUSE FOR THEM AFTER MIS PALMER DIED
WHILE COLD DROPS CAME OUT ON HIS FOREHEAD MIN'S FACE WAS AS PALLID AS MARBLE SAVE FOR ONE HEAVY BRUISE ACROSS THE CHEEK AND A CRUEL CUT AT THE EDGE OF THE DARK HAIR FROM WHICH THE BLOOD TRICKLED DOWN ON THE PILLOW
MIN'S IN ONE OF HER TANTRUMS NOW AND TAIN'T SAFE TO CROSS HER PATH WHAT IS MISSUS FULLER TO DO ASKED TELFORD ANXIOUSLY THAT'S THE QUESTION SHE'S SICKLY CAN'T WORK MUCH AND THEN SHE HAS HER LEETLE GAL
BUT SHE HAS HAD TO GO AT LAST GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT THE POOR CRITTER'LL DO SHE HASN'T A CENT NOR A RELATION SHE WAS JUST AN ORPHAN GIRL THAT PALMER BROUGHT UP SHE IS AT RAWLINGSES NOW
TELFORD HAD A CURIOUS EXPERIENCE AT THAT MOMENT HE SEEMED TO SEE LOOKING OUT FROM BEHIND THIS EXTERNAL MASK OF DEGRADED BEAUTY THE SEMBLANCE OF WHAT THIS WOMAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNDER MORE FAVOURING CIRCUMSTANCE OF BIRTH AND ENVIRONMENT
HE FLUNG HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BESIDE HER MIN MIN HE CALLED WILDLY THERE WAS NO ANSWER HE LIFTED HER IN HIS ARMS AND STAGGERED INTO THE HOUSE WITH HIS BURDEN HIS HEART STILLING WITH A HORRIBLE FEAR
HE WENT OFF AWFUL SUDDEN ANYWAY EVERYTHING WENT TO MIN'S CHILD TO MIN AS YE MIGHT SAY SHE'S BEEN BOSS
HE WOULD HAVE IT NEAR HIM ALWAYS HE BENT AND REVERENTLY KISSED THE COLD FACE THE CLOSED EYELIDS AND THE BLOOD STAINED BROW OF THE DEAD WOMAN THEN HE STOOD UP COME WITH ME DEAR HE SAID GENTLY TO THE CHILD
HE LIFTED HIS HAND TO KNOCK BUT BEFORE HE COULD DO SO THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND MIN HERSELF CONFRONTED HIM ON THE THRESHOLD SHE DID NOT NOW HAVE ON THE MAN'S OVERCOAT WHICH SHE HAD WORN AT THE STORE
CLOSE TO THE WINDOW SAT MIN'S CHILD
COMFORTABLY CURLED UP IN A NEIGHBOUR'S CHIMNEY CORNER SAW HIM DRIVE PAST EF THE MINISTER AIN'T GOIN TO PALMERS AFTER ALL HE CHUCKLED
BUT I HAVE NO WISH TO HEAR IDLE GOSSIP HIS CONCLUDING SENTENCE WAS QUITE UNHEEDED BY GALLETLY MIN PALMER'S THE WORST WOMAN IN RYKMAN'S CORNER OR OUT OF IT SHE ALWAYS WAS AN ODD ONE
AS SHE CAUGHT THE HORSE BY THE BRIDLE THE KITCHEN DOOR SWUNG HEAVILY TO WITH A SHARP SUDDEN BANG THE HORSE A GREAT POWERFUL NERVOUS BRUTE STARTED WILDLY AND THEN REARED IN TERROR THE ICE UNDERFOOT WAS GLIB AND TREACHEROUS
SHE WAS YET FAR NOBLER THAN THOSE WHO SAT IN JUDGEMENT UPON HER MIN MADE SOME SCANTY PURCHASES AND LEFT THE STORE QUICKLY BRUSHING UNHEEDINGLY PAST THE MINISTER AS SHE DID SO
I HATE ALL YOU MINISTERS DID YOU COME HERE TO LECTURE ME I SUPPOSE SOME OF THE CORNER SAINTS SET
AND HINTING THAT A CALL WAS TO BE MODERATED FOR HIM UNLESS HE SIGNIFIED HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT TWO YEARS BEFORE ALLAN TELFORD FRESH FROM COLLEGE AND FULL OF VIGOROUS ENTHUSIASM AND HIGH IDEAS WOULD HAVE SAID NO THAT IS NOT FOR ME
I'D BE WELL OUT OF THE WAY IT WAS A DULL GREY AFTERNOON A WEEK AFTERWARDS WHEN ALLAN TELFORD AGAIN WALKED UP THE RIVER ROAD TO THE PALMER PLACE THE WIND WAS BITTER AND HE WALKED WITH BENT HEAD TO AVOID ITS FURY
HER AND ROD FOUGHT LIKE CAT AND DOG ROSE MARRIED OSH FULLER A WORTHLESS DRUNKEN FELLOW HE DIED IN A YEAR OR SO AND LEFT ROSE AND HER BABY WITHOUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS THEN OLD PALMER WENT AND BROUGHT HER HOME
I WILL ACCEPT THIS CALL AND GO BACK TO MY OWN WORLD PERHAPS THE KEYNOTE OF HIS FAILURE WAS SOUNDED IN HIS LAST WORDS MY OWN WORLD HE HAD NEVER FELT
EVERY TIME I GO IN AND OUT AMONG MY PEOPLE I BEGIN TO SEE WHEREIN I HAVE FAILED I SHALL BEGIN AGAIN PATIENTLY AND HUMBLY I WROTE TODAY TO DECLINE THE C CHURCH CALL
FORGIVE ME FORGIVE ME AND WITH THE CRY THE SOUL OF POOR SUFFERING SINNING SINNED AGAINST MIN PALMER FLED WHO SHALL SAY WHITHER WHO SHALL SAY THAT HER REMORSEFUL CRY WAS NOT HEARD
GALLETLY EAGERLY JOINED THE GROUP OF LOUNGERS ON THE DIRTY WET PLATFORM AND TELFORD PASSED INTO THE STORE A COUPLE OF SLATTERNLY WOMEN WERE TALKING TO MISSUS RYKMAN ABOUT THE PALMER ROW
BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT MISSUS FULLER WAS IN TROUBLE OF SOME KIND AND THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO HELP HER IF POSSIBLE
JUST AS IF WE WERE STANDING ALONE SOMEWHERE OUT OF THE WORLD WHERE THERE WAS NO NEED OF WORDS TO SAY THINGS HE DOESN'T DESPISE ME
SHE WAS A QUIET WELL BEHAVED LITTLE CREETUR FOLKS SAID THE OLD MAN WANTED ROD TO MARRY HER
DO YOU THINK WE WILL EVER MEET AGAIN SHE SAID FAINTLY OUT THERE IT'S SO DARK GOD CAN NEVER FORGIVE ME I'VE BEEN SO WICKED
MIN DEAR HE SAID GENTLY YOU HAVE BEEN HURT NOT SERIOUSLY I HOPE I MUST LEAVE YOU FOR A MINUTE WHILE I RUN FOR HELP I WILL NOT BE LONG COME BACK SAID MIN IN A LOW BUT DISTINCT TONE
HE HAD BEEN TOO OUTSPOKEN FOR THEM THEY RESENTED SULLENLY HIS DIRECT AND INCISIVE TIRADES AGAINST THEIR PET SINS THEY VIEWED HIS SMALL INNOVATIONS ON THEIR TRADITIONAL WAYS OF WORSHIP WITH DISFAVOUR AND DISTRUST
MEANT TO BE SEEN AND HAILED THE MINISTER CHEERFULLY GOOD MORNIN MISTER TELFORD
HE TURNED AND WENT DOWN TO THE GATE A BITTER SENSE OF DEFEAT AND DISAPPOINTMENT FILLED HIS HEART AS HE DROVE AWAY MIN STOOD IN THE DOORWAY AND WATCHED THE SLEIGH OUT OF SIGHT DOWN THE RIVER ROAD
I KNOW NOT WHY BUT I HAVE LONGED INTENSELY LONGED FOR SOME TRUSTWORTHY EAR INTO WHICH TO POUR THIS HORRID SECRET WHY I REPEAT I CANNOT TELL FOR I EXPECT NO SYMPATHY AND HATE COMPASSION IT IS I SUPPOSE THE RESTLESS NATURE OF THE DEVIL THAT IS IN ME BUT BE IT WHAT IT MAY
SHE TURNED TO CYRIL WITH OUTSTRETCHED HAND OH YES MARIE'S COMING SHE SMILED IN ANSWER TO THE QUICK SHIFTING OF CYRIL'S EYES TO THE HALL DOORWAY AND AUNT HANNAH TOO THEY'RE UP STAIRS AND MARY JANE DEMANDED WILLIAM A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY
HIS FACE TWITCHING WITH A SMILE AND THEN THERE'S MISKITIES AND BLACK FLIES AND MOOSE FLIES AND BULL DOGS SAY WAIT A MONTH OR TWO TILL THE MISKITIES GET BUSY AND THEN TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW ANY GREAT AND GOOD GOD WOULD PUT SUCH THINGS ON EARTH
JOHN LOOKED UP AND SAW THE SMILING FACE OF FRANK AT HIS KITCHEN DOOR
A MAN BILLY THREE MASCULINE FORMS SAT SUDDENLY ERECT YES OH UNCLE WILLIAM I KNOW NOW JUST HOW YOU FELT I KNOW I KNOW GURGLED BILLY INCOHERENTLY
TO ME SIR THE PAST IS INTOLERABLY REPULSIVE ONE BOUNDLESS BARREN AND HIDEOUS GOLGOTHA OF DEAD HOPES AND MURDERED OPPORTUNITIES THE FUTURE STILL BLACKER AND MORE FURIOUS PEOPLED WITH DREADFUL FEATURES OF HORROR AND MENACE
I DON'T MEAN OF A MORAL SORT FOR THOSE I HOLD VERY CHEAP TO MY PREJUDICE INDEED I SHOULD HARDLY SAY TO MY PREJUDICE I MEAN I OUGHT TO SAY IN SHORT HAVE YOU HEARD PEOPLE REMARK UPON ANY FANCIED ECCENTRICITIES OR THAT SORT OF THING ABOUT ME
FOUR HAND ROUND DOS A BALNETTE RIGHT HAND TO PARTNER AND GRAND DOS A BALNETTE EVERY MAN TOOK HIS PARTNER'S RIGHT HAND AND WHEELED TO THE RIGHT AND THEN HER LEFT HAND THIS MOVEMENT BROUGHT THEM OPPOSITE AND SO THEY WERE IN A CIRCLE AT WHICH THEY BALANCED
DON'T PLEASE DON'T SHE CHOKED OR I SHALL DIE I'VE HAD ALL I CAN STAND ALREADY ALL YOU CAN STAND WHAT DO YOU MEAN
OR IF A FELLOW WERE SICK YOU WOULD HELP HIM OUT ALL YOU COULD AND YOU'D EXPECT ME TO DO THE SAME IF YOU SAW A FELLOW DROWNING IN THE RIVER YOU'D HELP HIM OUT BUT THE CHINAMAN WHO IS NOT A CHRISTIAN WOULD LET HIM DROWN YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN ALL RIGHT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT
THAT OCCURRENCE ABOUT WYNSTON BERKLEY HE IS THE HERO OF THE HELLISH ILLUSION AT CERTAIN TIMES SIR IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF HE THOUGH DEAD WERE STILL INVESTED WITH A SORT OF SPURIOUS LIFE GOING ABOUT UNRECOGNIZED EXCEPT BY ME IN SQUALOR AND CONTEMPT
WILLIAM'S FACE WAS RED A MAN MARY JANE CYRIL WAS MERELY CROSS
THAT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIS COMPANION UNTIL THEY WERE IN MOTION WHEN HE DID SO IT WAS WITH NO VERY PLEASURABLE FEELING AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT MARSTON TOO WOULD HAVE GLADLY ESCAPED THE COINCIDENCE WHICH THUS REDUCED THEM ONCE MORE TO THE TEMPORARY NECESSITY OF A TATE A TATE
HUGH AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD BY THE DOOR OF THE DINING HALL ON WENT THE DANCE AND THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE THICK WITH TOBACCO SMOKE THE NATIVE WOMEN WERE GUIDED THEIR BRONZED FACES SPEAKING EXCITEMENT COME ON IN GENTLEMEN THE WALLS OF THE ROOM WERE LINED WITH MEN
MARSTON PAUSED HE WAS STOOPED FORWARD AND LOOKING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE VEHICLE SO THAT HIS COMPANION COULD NOT SEE HIS COUNTENANCE A SILENCE ENSUED WHICH WAS INTERRUPTED BY MARSTON WHO ONCE MORE RESUMED SIR SAID HE
IF ANY OF YOU HAD SUFFERED WHAT HE HAS AT THE HANDS OF A SWARM OF YOUNGSTERS FOR THAT NAME'S SAKE YOU WOULDN'T BLAME HIM FOR BEING TEMPTED TO GET WHAT FUN HE COULD OUT OF MARY JANE IF THERE EVER CAME A CHANCE NATURALLY AFTER THIS THERE COULD BE NOTHING STIFF OR EMBARRASSING
BUT WHAT DOES THE M J STAND FOR ANYHOW NOBODY ANSWERED THIS HOWEVER PERHAPS BECAUSE AUNT HANNAH AND MARIE APPEARED JUST THEN IN THE DOORWAY DINNER PROVED TO BE A LIVELY MEAL IN THE NEWCOMER BERTRAM MET HIS MATCH FOR WIT AND SATIRE
THE SENSE OF SOLITUDE UNDER THIS AGGRESSIVE AND TREMENDOUS DELUSION WAS AGONY HOURLY DEATH TO MY SOUL THAT IS THE SECRET OF MY TALKATIVENESS MY SOLE EXCUSE FOR PLAGUING YOU WITH THE DREAMS OF A WRETCHED HYPOCHONDRIAC
CYRIL AND MARIE WITHDREW INTO A STILL MORE SECLUDED CORNER TO LOOK AT THEIR PLANS AND BERTRAM FOUND HIMSELF AT LAST ALONE WITH BILLY HE FORGOT THEN IN THE BLISSFUL HOUR HE SPENT WITH HER BEFORE THE OPEN FIRE HOW HE HATED MUSIC
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE FELT CALLED UPON AT ONE TIME TO DIVULGE HIS BELIEF WHICH IN THE PAST HAD BEEN A BURDEN OF MUCH QUESTIONING BUT HERE IT WAS ASKED PERHAPS IN LEVITY BY ONE WHO EVIDENTLY COULD NOT FULLY BELIEVE HE FELT CALLED UPON TO ANSWER YES I DO
SAY WHY DON'T YOU FELLOWS GET IN AND DANCE DREAMS AND FANCIES WERE REFT AWAY AS REALITY IN THE PERSON OF HASKINS OF THE SAW PITS STOOD BEFORE JOHN BERWICK
BREATHED BILLY CONFUSEDLY THREE CRIMSON FACED MEN SPRANG TO THEIR FEET THE SITUATION FOR A MOMENT THREATENED EMBARRASSED MISERY FOR ALL CONCERNED BUT ARKWRIGHT WITH A CHEERY SMILE ADVANCED STRAIGHT TOWARD BERTRAM AND HELD OUT A FRIENDLY HAND
THAT THIS LITTLE GENTLEMAN HAVING VISITED ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM ALL HIS DOMESTIC PATIENTS WAS ABOUT TO TAKE HIS ACCUSTOMED WALK IN HIS SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED PLEASURE GROUNDS WHEN HIS SERVANT ANNOUNCED A VISITOR A GENTLEMAN HE REPEATED YOU HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE EH NO SIR REPLIED THE MAN
CYRIL'S CHIN HAD LIFTED AT THE FIRST TONE HE WAS LISTENING NOW WITH VERY OBVIOUS PLEASURE BERTRAM TOO WAS SHOWING BY HIS ATTITUDE THE KEENEST APPRECIATION WILLIAM AND AUNT HANNAH RESTING BACK IN THEIR CHAIRS
AVOIDED ALL CONTACT AND INTERCOURSE WITH MISSUS MARSTON OR AS FOR DISTINCTNESS SAKE WE SHALL CONTINUE TO CALL HER MADEMOISELLE SINCE HER RETURN
BUT THE FACT IS THIS BEGINNING LIKE A SPECK THIS ONE IDEA HAS GRADUALLY DARKENED AND DILATED UNTIL IT HAS FILLED MY ENTIRE MIND THE SOLITARY CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE GIGANTIC MASTERY IT HAS ESTABLISHED THERE HAD GROWN INTOLERABLE I MUST HAVE TOLD IT
HE PUT THE QUESTION WITH OBVIOUS DIFFICULTY AND AT LAST SEEMED TO OVERCOME HIS OWN RELUCTANCE WITH A SORT OF ANGRY AND EXCITED SELF CONTEMPT AND IMPATIENCE DOCTOR DANVERS WAS A LITTLE PUZZLED BY THE INTERROGATORY AND ADMITTED IN REPLY
THOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY IT SERIOUS LIKE BUT THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD TALK OF YOURS AND SURE SOUNDS NATURAL SAY IS THAT OTHER KING GEORGE MAN WITH YOU AS GOOD A FELLOW AS YOU ARE SAY YOU'VE SET ME THINKING
OF THE TALISMAN OF SOLOMON TELL ME O TALISMAN SAID HE WHY ALL THESE PEOPLE WEEP AND WAIL SO CONTINUOUSLY REST CONTENT SAID THE TALISMAN OF SOLOMON WITH KNOWING THAT WHICH CONCERNS THINE OWN SELF
NOT A SOUND WAS TO BE HEARD NOT A THING MOVED BUT SILENCE HUNG LIKE A VEIL BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SKY FOLLOWING THE DEMON THE YOUNG MAN ASCENDED A FLIGHT OF STEPS AND SO ENTERED THE VESTIBULE OF THE PALACE
AND IN AN INSTANT TRANSPORTED THEM TO THE GARDEN AND TO THE TREASURE HOUSE THOU ART WHERE THOU COMMANDEST TO BE SAID THE DEMON THE YOUNG MAN IMMEDIATELY DREW A CIRCLE UPON THE GROUND WITH HIS FINGER TIP HE STRUCK HIS HEEL UPON THE CIRCLE
AND WHICH WE ARE TO ENJOY TOGETHER THE YOUNG MAN WAS DRUNK WITH HAPPINESS THOU SHALT SEE IT ALL SAID HE THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THE TALISMAN SPOKE WITHOUT BEING QUESTIONED FOOL IT CRIED WILT THOU NOT BE ADVISED
AYE AYE SAID SAINT GEORGE AND SO IT SHOULD END
IT OPENED SWIFTLY AND SILENTLY AND THEY ENTERED WITHIN WAS A NARROW ROOM AS RED AS BLOOD A FLAMING LAMP HUNG FROM THE CEILING ABOVE THE YOUNG MAN STOOD AS THOUGH TURNED TO STONE
HE SEIZED THE YOUNG MAN BY THE GIRDLE AND IN AN INSTANT FLEW AWAY WITH HIM TO A HANGING GARDEN THAT LAY BEFORE THE QUEEN'S PALACE THOU ART THE FIRST MAN SAID ZADOK WHO HAS SEEN
NO ONE SINCE THAT TIME HAS BEEN PERMITTED TO ENTER THE PALACE IT IS FORBIDDEN FOR ANY ONE EVEN TO ASK A QUESTION CONCERNING IT BUT EVERY YEAR ON THE DAY ON WHICH THE QUEEN WAS TURNED TO STONE THE WHOLE LAND MOURNS WITH WEEPING AND WAILING
THE YOUNG MAN DESCENDED THE STEPS WITH THE QUEEN BEHIND HIM AND BEHIND THEM BOTH CAME THE DEMON ZADOK THE YOUNG MAN OPENED THE DOOR OF ADAMANT AND ENTERED THE FIRST OF THE VAULTED ROOMS
CROWDED WITH COURTIERS AND NOBLES AND LORDS IN THEIR ROBES OF OFFICE MAGNIFICENT BEYOND FANCYING BUT EACH SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EACH A STONE AS WHITE AS ALABASTER
AND WHEREON WERE ENGRAVED THESE WORDS BEHOLD BEYOND THIS DOOR IS THAT ALONE WHICH SHALL SATISFY ALL THY DESIRES NO CRIED SHE WHAT IS IT THAT LIES BEHIND YON DOOR
FOR THERE STOOD A GIGANTIC BLACK DEMON WITH A NAPKIN WRAPPED AROUND HIS LOINS AND A SCIMITAR IN HIS RIGHT HAND THE BLADE OF WHICH GLEAMED LIKE LIGHTNING IN THE FLAME OF THE LAMP BEFORE HIM LAY A BASKET FILLED WITH SAWDUST
CALLED THE WISE ALL THIS HAPPINESS THIS ECSTASY THAT IS NOW MINE
THEREUPON HE VANISHED LIKE A FLASH LEAVING THE YOUNG MAN STANDING LIKE ONE IN A DREAM HE SAW BEFORE HIM A GARDEN OF SUCH SPLENDOR AND MAGNIFICENCE AS HE HAD NEVER DREAMED OF EVEN IN HIS WILDEST FANCY
IT BECAME ALIVE EVEN IF IT WERE A DEAD STONE TELL ME ZADOK CRIED THE YOUNG MAN I COMMAND YOU TO TELL ME WHERE IS THAT WAND OF SILVER AND GOLD I HAVE IT WITH ME SAID ZADOK
INSTANTLY THE EARTH OPENED AND THERE APPEARED A FLIGHT OF MARBLE STEPS LEADING DOWNWARD INTO THE EARTH
BUT WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE STOOD WAS A GREAT ARCHED DOOR OF ADAMANT THE DOOR WAS TIGHTLY SHUT AND THERE WAS NEITHER LOCK NOR KEY TO IT UPON THE DOOR WERE WRITTEN THESE WORDS IN LETTERS OF FLAME
A PALACE OF MARBLE AND GOLD AND CARMINE AND ULTRAMARINE RISING INTO THE PURPLE STARRY SKY AND SHINING IN THE MOONLIGHT LIKE A VISION OF PARADISE THE PALACE WAS ILLUMINATED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
TO ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL THE YOUNG MAN WALKED UP THE AVENUE OF MARBLE TO THE PALACE SURROUNDED BY THE ARMED ATTENDANTS IN THEIR DRESSES OF JEWELS AND GOLD AND PRECEDED BY DANCING GIRLS AS BEAUTIFUL AS
THEY WENT INTO THE THIRD ROOM AND WHEN THE QUEEN SAW THE BASIN OF JEWELS
NOW SAID HE TO THE QUEEN I WILL SHOW YOU OUR TREASURE HE CALLED ALOUD
THY FATHER WHO WAS THE WISEST AND MOST CUNNING MAGICIAN IN THE WORLD TURNED HER INTO STONE
THEN HE TOUCHED THE LIPS WITH THE GOLDEN TIP OF THE WAND IN AN INSTANT THERE CAME A MARVELLOUS CHANGE HE SAW THE STONE MELT AND BEGIN TO GROW FLEXIBLE AND SOFT HE SAW IT BECOME WARM
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR WAS A BASIN SUCH AS ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL HAD SEEN IN THE OTHER ROOM BEYOND ONLY THIS WAS FILLED WITH GOLD
BEAR THY PUNISHMENT THOU FOOL SAID THE TALISMAN
AS LIGHT AS DAY UPON EITHER SIDE OF THE AVENUE STOOD A ROW OF BLACK SLAVES CLAD IN GARMENTS OF WHITE SILK
AND WHY DO THEY GO CRAZY WHEN I DO BUT ASK THEM WHY THEY ARE SO AFFLICTED I WILL TELL THEE SAID ZADOK SEVEN AND THIRTY YEARS AGO THERE WAS A QUEEN OVER THIS LAND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THAT EVER WAS SEEN
THEN SAID THE YOUNG MAN I COMMAND YOU TO TAKE ME THITHER INSTANTLY
THUS SHOULD THE HEADS OF ALL THE LIKE BE CHOPPED OFF FROM THEIR SHOULDERS IS THERE NOT SOME ONE HERE TO TELL US A FAIR STORY ABOUT A SAINT FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SAID THE LAD WHO FIDDLED WHEN THE JEW WAS IN THE BRAMBLE BUSH
THE YOUNG MAN SMOTE HIS HAND UPON HIS HEAD WHAT A FOOL I AM SAID HE NOT TO HAVE THOUGHT TO CALL UPON ZADOK BEFORE THIS THEN HE CALLED ALOUD
AND FLEW THROUGH THE AIR SO SWIFTLY THAT THE STARS APPEARED TO SLIDE AWAY BEHIND THEM IN A MOMENT HE SET THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN UPON THE GROUND AND ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL FOUND HIMSELF AT THE END OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE A VAST AND SPLENDID GARDEN
