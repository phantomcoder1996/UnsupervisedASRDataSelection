AND HE THEN TURNED TO GOD ALL THE PIOUS IDEAS THAT HAD BEEN SO LONG FORGOTTEN RETURNED HE RECOLLECTED THE PRAYERS HIS MOTHER HAD TAUGHT HIM
EDMOND FANCIED HE HEARD A BITTER LAUGH RESOUNDING FROM THE DEPTHS
ALL HIS SORROWS ALL HIS SUFFERINGS WITH THEIR TRAIN OF GLOOMY SPECTRES FLED FROM HIS CELL WHEN THE ANGEL OF DEATH SEEMED ABOUT TO ENTER DANTES REVIEWED HIS PAST LIFE WITH COMPOSURE
OR WHETHER THE NOISE WAS REALLY LOUDER THAN USUAL EDMOND RAISED HIS HEAD AND LISTENED IT WAS A CONTINUAL SCRATCHING AS IF MADE BY A HUGE CLAW A POWERFUL TOOTH OR SOME IRON INSTRUMENT ATTACKING THE STONES
WHEN MY MORNING AND EVENING MEALS ARE BROUGHT THOUGHT HE I WILL CAST THEM OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THEY WILL THINK THAT I HAVE EATEN THEM HE KEPT HIS WORD TWICE A DAY HE CAST OUT THROUGH THE BARRED APERTURE THE PROVISIONS HIS JAILER BROUGHT HIM
IF IT IS A WORKMAN I NEED BUT KNOCK AGAINST THE WALL AND HE WILL CEASE TO WORK IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHO IS KNOCKING AND WHY HE DOES SO BUT AS HIS OCCUPATION IS SANCTIONED BY THE GOVERNOR HE WILL SOON RESUME IT
HE FEARED THAT THE EMOTION OF HIS VOICE WOULD BETRAY HIM THE JAILER WENT AWAY SHAKING HIS HEAD NIGHT CAME DANTES HOPED THAT HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD PROFIT BY THE SILENCE TO ADDRESS HIM BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER
THEN HE RAISED TO HIS LIPS THE REPAST THAT LIKE A VOLUNTARY TANTALUS HE REFUSED HIMSELF BUT HE THOUGHT OF HIS OATH AND HE WOULD NOT BREAK IT HE PERSISTED UNTIL AT LAST
AND LOOKING FORWARD WITH TERROR TO HIS FUTURE EXISTENCE CHOSE THAT MIDDLE LINE THAT SEEMED TO AFFORD HIM A REFUGE SOMETIMES SAID HE IN MY VOYAGES WHEN I WAS A MAN AND COMMANDED OTHER MEN
YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY WHEN YOU BRING ME MY BREAKFAST THIS ADVICE WAS TO THE JAILER'S TASTE AS IT SPARED HIM THE NECESSITY OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP HE LEFT THE SAUCEPAN
OR THE PUNISHMENT THAT POSSIBLY WILL FOLLOW THERE IS A SORT OF CONSOLATION AT THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE YAWNING ABYSS AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH LIE DARKNESS AND OBSCURITY EDMOND FOUND SOME SOLACE IN THESE IDEAS
HE WENT TO A CORNER OF HIS DUNGEON DETACHED A STONE AND WITH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE WALL WHERE THE SOUND CAME HE STRUCK THRICE AT THE FIRST BLOW THE SOUND CEASED AS IF BY MAGIC EDMOND LISTENED INTENTLY AN HOUR PASSED
IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE TO DIG ABOVE OR UNDER IT THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THIS O MY GOD MY GOD MURMURED HE I HAVE SO EARNESTLY PRAYED TO YOU THAT I HOPED MY PRAYERS HAD BEEN HEARD
SOON THE FURY OF THE WAVES AND THE SIGHT OF THE SHARP ROCKS ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND DEATH THEN TERRIFIED ME AND I USED ALL MY SKILL AND INTELLIGENCE AS A MAN AND A SAILOR TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE WRATH OF GOD BUT I DID SO BECAUSE I WAS HAPPY
DEVOURED IT SO TO SPEAK AS THE IMPLACABLE UGOLINO DEVOURS THE SKULL OF ARCHBISHOP ROGER IN THE INFERNO OF DANTE RAGE SUPPLANTED RELIGIOUS FERVOR
EDMOND'S HAIR STOOD ON END AND HE ROSE TO HIS KNEES AH SAID HE I HEAR A HUMAN VOICE EDMOND HAD NOT HEARD ANY ONE SPEAK SAVE HIS JAILER FOR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS
I HAVE LOST ALL THAT BOUND ME TO LIFE DEATH SMILES AND INVITES ME TO REPOSE I DIE AFTER MY OWN MANNER I DIE EXHAUSTED AND BROKEN SPIRITED AS I FALL ASLEEP WHEN I HAVE PACED THREE THOUSAND TIMES ROUND MY CELL
THE JAILER ALWAYS BROUGHT DANTES SOUP IN AN IRON SAUCEPAN THIS SAUCEPAN CONTAINED SOUP FOR BOTH PRISONERS
BUT NOW THE JAILER MIGHT HEAR THE NOISE AND PUT AN END TO IT AND SO DESTROY A RAY OF SOMETHING LIKE HOPE THAT SOOTHED HIS LAST MOMENTS THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM HIS BREAKFAST
HE SOON FELT THAT HIS IDEAS BECAME AGAIN COLLECTED HE COULD THINK AND STRENGTHEN HIS THOUGHTS BY REASONING THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF I MUST PUT THIS TO THE TEST BUT WITHOUT COMPROMISING ANYBODY
BUT AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR HE HAD SCRAPED OFF A HANDFUL A MATHEMATICIAN MIGHT HAVE CALCULATED THAT IN TWO YEARS SUPPOSING THAT THE ROCK WAS NOT ENCOUNTERED A PASSAGE TWENTY FEET LONG AND TWO FEET BROAD MIGHT BE FORMED
I HAVE A FATHER WHO IS SEVENTY IF HE YET LIVES I ONLY LOVE HIM AND A YOUNG GIRL CALLED MERCEDES MY FATHER HAS NOT YET FORGOTTEN ME I AM SURE BUT GOD ALONE KNOWS IF SHE LOVES ME STILL I SHALL LOVE YOU AS I LOVED MY FATHER
SINCE EIGHTEEN ELEVEN DANTES SHUDDERED THIS MAN HAD BEEN FOUR YEARS LONGER THAN HIMSELF IN PRISON DO NOT DIG ANY MORE SAID THE VOICE ONLY TELL ME HOW HIGH UP IS YOUR EXCAVATION
HE FELT MORE GRATITUDE FOR THE POSSESSION OF THIS PIECE OF IRON THAN HE HAD EVER FELT FOR ANYTHING HE HAD NOTICED HOWEVER THAT THE PRISONER ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD CEASED TO LABOR NO MATTER THIS WAS A GREATER REASON FOR PROCEEDING
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HEAVEN HAD AT LENGTH TAKEN PITY ON HIM AND HAD SENT THIS NOISE TO WARN HIM ON THE VERY BRINK OF THE ABYSS PERHAPS ONE OF THOSE BELOVED ONES HE HAD SO OFTEN THOUGHT OF WAS THINKING OF HIM
EDMOND HEARD A HOLLOW SOUND IN THE WALL AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LYING SO MANY LOATHSOME ANIMALS INHABITED THE PRISON THAT THEIR NOISE DID NOT IN GENERAL AWAKE HIM BUT WHETHER ABSTINENCE HAD QUICKENED HIS FACULTIES
UNLESS THE PROTECTING HAND OF GOD SNATCH HIM THENCE ALL IS OVER AND HIS STRUGGLES BUT TEND TO HASTEN HIS DESTRUCTION THIS STATE OF MENTAL ANGUISH IS HOWEVER LESS TERRIBLE THAN THE SUFFERINGS THAT PRECEDE
AND DURING THE FOUR DAYS THAT HE HAD BEEN CARRYING OUT HIS PURPOSE EDMOND HAD NOT SPOKEN TO THE ATTENDANT HAD NOT ANSWERED HIM WHEN HE INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL WHEN HE LOOKED TOO CURIOUSLY AT HIM
DANTES MIND HAD REVOLTED AT THE IDEA OF ASSEMBLAGES OF PRISONERS MADE UP OF THIEVES VAGABONDS AND MURDERERS HE NOW WISHED TO BE AMONGST THEM IN ORDER TO SEE SOME OTHER FACE BESIDES THAT OF HIS JAILER
BECAUSE AFTER TORTURE CAME DEATH AND AFTER DEATH IF NOT REPOSE AT LEAST THE BOON OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY DINT OF CONSTANTLY DWELLING ON THE IDEA THAT TRANQUILLITY WAS DEATH
IN THE MORNING THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM FRESH PROVISIONS HE HAD ALREADY DEVOURED THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HE ATE THESE LISTENING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE SOUND WALKING ROUND AND ROUND HIS CELL
DANTES RAISED HIMSELF UP AND BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BAD QUALITY OF THE FOOD ABOUT THE COLDNESS OF HIS DUNGEON GRUMBLING AND COMPLAINING IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR SPEAKING LOUDER
HIS PROSPECTS LESS DESPERATE HE WAS STILL YOUNG HE WAS ONLY FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY HE HAD NEARLY FIFTY YEARS TO LIVE WHAT UNFORSEEN EVENTS MIGHT NOT OPEN HIS PRISON DOOR AND RESTORE HIM TO LIBERTY
JUST AS HE REMOVED HIS BED FROM THE WALL HE HEARD THREE KNOCKS HE THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES IS IT YOU SAID HE I AM HERE IS YOUR JAILER GONE
AND IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A SCREW DRIVER TO TAKE THEM OFF THE TABLE AND CHAIR HAD NOTHING THE PAIL HAD ONCE POSSESSED A HANDLE BUT THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED
NOW WHEN EVENING CAME DANTES PUT HIS PLATE ON THE GROUND NEAR THE DOOR THE JAILER AS HE ENTERED STEPPED ON IT AND BROKE IT
OF HAVING CONSPIRED TO AID THE EMPEROR'S RETURN
WHEN THE HOUR FOR HIS JAILER'S VISIT ARRIVED DANTES STRAIGHTENED THE HANDLE OF THE SAUCEPAN AS WELL AS HE COULD AND PLACED IT IN ITS ACCUSTOMED PLACE THE TURNKEY POURED HIS RATION OF SOUP INTO IT TOGETHER WITH THE FISH
IT WAS EASY TO ASCERTAIN THIS BUT HOW COULD HE RISK THE QUESTION IT WAS EASY TO CALL HIS JAILER'S ATTENTION TO THE NOISE AND WATCH HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE LISTENED
HE HAD OFTEN HEARD THAT SHIPWRECKED PERSONS HAD DIED THROUGH HAVING EAGERLY DEVOURED TOO MUCH FOOD EDMOND REPLACED ON THE TABLE THE BREAD HE WAS ABOUT TO DEVOUR AND RETURNED TO HIS COUCH HE DID NOT WISH TO DIE
THE PRISONER HAD DISCOVERED THE DANGER AND HAD SUBSTITUTED A LEVER FOR A CHISEL ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY EDMOND DETERMINED TO ASSIST THE INDEFATIGABLE LABORER
AT THE END OF THE SECOND HE HAD CEASED TO MARK THE LAPSE OF TIME DANTES SAID I WISH TO DIE AND HAD CHOSEN THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH AND FEARFUL OF CHANGING HIS MIND HE HAD TAKEN AN OATH TO DIE
DANTES HEARD JOYFULLY THE KEY GRATE IN THE LOCK HE LISTENED UNTIL THE SOUND OF STEPS DIED AWAY AND THEN HASTILY DISPLACING HIS BED SAW BY THE FAINT LIGHT THAT PENETRATED INTO HIS CELL
IF HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD NOT COME TO HIM HE WOULD GO TO HIS NEIGHBOR ALL DAY HE TOILED ON UNTIRINGLY AND BY THE EVENING HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN EXTRACTING TEN HANDFULS OF PLASTER AND FRAGMENTS OF STONE
TWO HOURS PASSED AND NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE WALL ALL WAS SILENT THERE FULL OF HOPE EDMOND SWALLOWED A FEW MOUTHFULS OF BREAD AND WATER AND THANKS TO THE VIGOR OF HIS CONSTITUTION FOUND HIMSELF WELL NIGH RECOVERED
PROPOSED TASKS TO ACCOMPLISH AND AT THE END OF EVERY PRAYER INTRODUCED THE ENTREATY OFTENER ADDRESSED TO MAN THAN TO GOD FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES AS WE FORGIVE THEM THAT TRESPASS AGAINST US
HE HELD THE PLATE IN HIS HAND FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME AND GAZED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MORSEL OF BAD MEAT OF TAINTED FISH OF BLACK AND MOULDY BREAD IT WAS THE LAST YEARNING FOR LIFE CONTENDING WITH THE RESOLUTION OF DESPAIR
OR REFUSE FOOD AND DIE OF STARVATION BUT THE FIRST WAS REPUGNANT TO HIM
A SAILOR HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE SINCE THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN YOUR CRIME I AM INNOCENT
AS THE JAILER WAS VISITING HIM FOR THE LAST TIME THAT NIGHT
THE PRISONER REPROACHED HIMSELF WITH NOT HAVING THUS EMPLOYED THE HOURS HE HAD PASSED IN VAIN HOPES PRAYER AND DESPONDENCY DURING THE SIX YEARS THAT HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED WHAT MIGHT HE NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
HE ADDRESSED HIS SUPPLICATIONS NOT TO GOD BUT TO MAN GOD IS ALWAYS THE LAST RESOURCE UNFORTUNATES WHO OUGHT TO BEGIN WITH GOD DO NOT HAVE ANY HOPE IN HIM TILL THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER MEANS OF DELIVERANCE
FOR A CHANGE HOWEVER DISADVANTAGEOUS WAS STILL A CHANGE AND WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME AMUSEMENT HE ENTREATED TO BE ALLOWED TO WALK ABOUT TO HAVE FRESH AIR BOOKS AND WRITING MATERIALS HIS REQUESTS WERE NOT GRANTED
YES SAID DANTES HE WILL NOT RETURN UNTIL THE EVENING SO THAT WE HAVE TWELVE HOURS BEFORE US I CAN WORK THEN SAID THE VOICE OH YES YES THIS INSTANT I ENTREAT YOU IN A MOMENT THAT PART OF THE FLOOR ON WHICH DANTES WAS RESTING HIS TWO HANDS
AND HE LAID THE REQUEST OF NUMBER THIRTY FOUR BEFORE THE GOVERNOR BUT THE LATTER SAPIENTLY IMAGINED THAT DANTES WISHED TO CONSPIRE OR ATTEMPT AN ESCAPE AND REFUSED HIS REQUEST DANTES HAD EXHAUSTED ALL HUMAN RESOURCES
BUT HE WENT ON ASKING ALL THE SAME HE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SPEAKING TO THE NEW JAILER ALTHOUGH THE LATTER WAS IF POSSIBLE MORE TACITURN THAN THE OLD ONE BUT STILL TO SPEAK TO A MAN EVEN THOUGH MUTE WAS SOMETHING
DANTES SPOKE FOR THE SAKE OF HEARING HIS OWN VOICE HE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK WHEN ALONE BUT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TERRIFIED HIM OFTEN BEFORE HIS CAPTIVITY
DANTES WAS ON HIS BED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THUS HE BETTER GUARDED THE UNFINISHED OPENING DOUBTLESS THERE WAS A STRANGE EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES FOR THE JAILER SAID COME ARE YOU GOING MAD AGAIN DANTES DID NOT ANSWER
ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT I WAS JUST NINETEEN WHEN I WAS ARRESTED THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN NOT QUITE TWENTY SIX MURMURED THE VOICE AT THAT AGE HE CANNOT BE A TRAITOR
I SWEAR TO YOU BY HIM WHO DIED FOR US THAT NAUGHT SHALL INDUCE ME TO BREATHE ONE SYLLABLE TO MY JAILERS BUT I CONJURE YOU DO NOT ABANDON ME IF YOU DO I SWEAR TO YOU FOR I HAVE GOT TO THE END OF MY STRENGTH
HIS DEADLY ENEMIES INDEED ONE OF HIS MOST SERIOUS FAULTS WAS AN INORDINATE CONTEMPT FOR YOUTH AND THIS CONTEMPT WAS THE MORE UNJUSTIFIABLE
HE WAS UNABLE TO PERCEIVE THAT THE TIME WAS FAST APPROACHING WHEN THAT HOUSE IF IT CONTINUED TO EXIST AT ALL MUST BE SUPREME IN THE STATE WHEN THE MANAGEMENT OF THAT HOUSE WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS AND WHEN
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE ROUNDHEADS THE ANGLICAN CHURCH THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ENGLAND SCOTLAND IRELAND YET SUCH WAS HIS GENIUS AND RESOLUTION
AND THAT THE RESTORATION OF THE MONARCHY WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THE RESTORATION OF HIS OWN DILAPIDATED FORTUNES NONE OF THESE EXPECTANTS COULD RESTRAIN HIS INDIGNATION WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS AS POOR UNDER THE KING
THE PLACE WHERE ELIZABETH HAD WITH MANLY SPIRIT HURLED FOUL SCORN AT PARMA AND SPAIN WAS INSULTED BY THE INVADERS THE ROAR OF FOREIGN GUNS WAS HEARD
WHEN IT WAS NOISED ABROAD THAT THE COURT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO TREAT PAPISTS WITH THE SAME RIGOUR WHICH HAD BEEN SHOWN TO PRESBYTERIANS A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE KING AND THE DUKE WERE NOT SINCERE PROTESTANTS
PACIFIED AND REGULATED KINGDOMS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE INDEED IF HIS NOTIONS HAD BEEN STILL THE SAME AS IN THE DAYS WHEN HIS MIND WAS PRINCIPALLY OCCUPIED BY HIS FIELDS AND HIS RELIGION AND WHEN THE GREATEST EVENTS WHICH DIVERSIFIED THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE WERE A CATTLE FAIR
THE PARLIAMENT FORGOT THAT IT WAS BUT THE CREATURE OF THE ARMY THE ARMY WAS LESS DISPOSED THAN EVER TO SUBMIT TO THE DICTATION OF THE PARLIAMENT INDEED
THE LORDS UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED THE PROPOSITION THAT THE KING SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL THEIR HOUSE WAS INSTANTLY CLOSED NO COURT KNOWN TO THE LAW WOULD TAKE ON ITSELF THE OFFICE OF JUDGING THE FOUNTAIN OF JUSTICE
HE WAS THE OSTENSIBLE HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WAS THEREFORE HELD RESPONSIBLE EVEN FOR THOSE ACTS WHICH HE HAD STRONGLY BUT VAINLY OPPOSED IN COUNCIL HE WAS REGARDED BY THE PURITANS
UNDER THE RULE OF HER LEGITIMATE KINGS ENGLAND HAD ALREADY CEASED TO STRUGGLE BUT THE TWO OTHER KINGDOMS WHICH HAD BEEN GOVERNED BY THE STUARTS WERE HOSTILE TO THE NEW REPUBLIC THE INDEPENDENT PARTY WAS EQUALLY ODIOUS TO THE ROMAN CATHOLICS OF IRELAND
WITH THE FATE OF THE CHANCELLOR BEFORE THEIR EYES WERE ANXIOUS FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY THEY ACCORDINGLY ADVISED THEIR MASTER TO SOOTHE THE IRRITATION WHICH PREVAILED BOTH IN THE PARLIAMENT AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND FOR THAT END
WERE SUMMONED TO THE ASSEMBLY WHICH WAS TO LEGISLATE AT WESTMINSTER FOR EVERY PART OF THE BRITISH ISLES TO CREATE A HOUSE OF LORDS WAS A LESS EASY TASK DEMOCRACY DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SUPPORT OF PRESCRIPTION
OF HIS OWN PALACE IN NO LONG TIME IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT THOSE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS TO WHOM THIS DEED IS TO BE ASCRIBED HAD COMMITTED NOT ONLY A CRIME BUT AN ERROR
HE COULD BE SAFE ONLY BY BEING ABSOLUTE THE FIRST HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH THE PEOPLE ELECTED BY HIS COMMAND QUESTIONED HIS AUTHORITY AND WAS DISSOLVED WITHOUT HAVING PASSED A SINGLE ACT HIS SECOND HOUSE OF COMMONS
THE COMMONS ALONE COULD LEGALLY GRANT HIM MONEY THEY COULD NOT BE PREVENTED FROM PUTTING THEIR OWN PRICE ON THEIR GRANTS THE PRICE WHICH THEY PUT ON THEIR GRANTS WAS THIS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH EVERY ONE OF THE KING'S PREROGATIVES
AND HOW WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE WAS NO MORE AMSTERDAM WAS LIGHTED UP AS FOR A GREAT DELIVERANCE AND CHILDREN RAN ALONG THE CANALS SHOUTING FOR JOY THAT THE DEVIL WAS DEAD EVEN ROYALISTS
WITH MANY STRUGGLES AND MISGIVINGS AND PROBABLY NOT WITHOUT MANY PRAYERS THE DECISION WAS MADE CHARLES WAS LEFT TO HIS FATE THE MILITARY SAINTS RESOLVED THAT IN DEFIANCE OF THE OLD LAWS OF THE REALM
AND DREAD TO HIS SUBJECTS FEW INDEED LOVED HIS GOVERNMENT BUT THOSE WHO HATED IT MOST HATED IT LESS THAN THEY FEARED IT HAD IT BEEN A WORSE GOVERNMENT IT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS STRENGTH HAD IT BEEN A WEAKER GOVERNMENT
IN SPITE OF THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF JEALOUS TRADERS AND FANATICAL THEOLOGIANS PERMITTED TO BUILD A SYNAGOGUE IN LONDON
EXCLAIMED THAT THE STATE COULD BE SAVED ONLY BY CALLING THE OLD SOLDIERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH TO ARMS SOON THE CAPITAL BEGAN TO FEEL THE MISERIES OF A BLOCKADE FUEL WAS SCARCELY TO BE PROCURED TILBURY FORT
PROFESSED THE STRONGEST ATTACHMENT BUT TO CLARENDON THEY OWED NO ALLEGIANCE AND THEY FELL ON HIM AS FURIOUSLY AS THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD FALLEN ON STRAFFORD THE MINISTER'S VIRTUES AND VICES ALIKE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS RUIN
HE HAD AN OBVIOUS MOTIVE FOR WISHING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A BARREN QUEEN AND HE WAS THEREFORE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PURPOSELY RECOMMENDED ONE THE SALE OF DUNKIRK WAS JUSTLY IMPUTED TO HIM
BUT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THE CHARGES OF DUNKIRK FELL FAR SHORT OF THE SUMS WHICH WERE WASTED AT COURT IN VICE AND FOLLY IT SEEMED INSUPPORTABLE THAT A SOVEREIGN PROFUSE BEYOND EXAMPLE IN ALL THAT REGARDED HIS OWN PLEASURES
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS READILY VOTED SUMS UNEXAMPLED IN OUR HISTORY SUMS EXCEEDING THOSE WHICH HAD SUPPORTED THE FLEETS AND ARMIES OF CROMWELL AT THE TIME WHEN HIS POWER WAS THE TERROR OF ALL THE WORLD
HAD REGARDED THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA WAS IT WISE MEN ASKED AT SUCH A TIME TO MAKE ANY ADDITION TO THE STRENGTH OF A MONARCHY ALREADY TOO FORMIDABLE DUNKIRK WAS MOREOVER PRIZED BY THE PEOPLE
HIS PICTURE GALLERY FILLED WITH MASTERPIECES OF VANDYKE WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN THE PROPERTY OF RUINED CAVALIERS HIS PALACE WHICH REARED ITS LONG AND STATELY FRONT RIGHT OPPOSITE TO THE HUMBLER RESIDENCE OF OUR KINGS
FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS HE WAS EQUALLY DISLIKED BY THE COURT
AN ADDITION WAS MADE TO THE NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS FOR THE CAPITAL THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE WAS PLACED ON SUCH A FOOTING THAT EVERY MAN OF SUBSTANCE WHETHER POSSESSED OF FREEHOLD ESTATES IN LAND OR NOT HAD A VOTE FOR THE COUNTY IN WHICH HE RESIDED
BUT IN A FEW YEARS HE THOUGHT IT SAFE TO PROCEED FURTHER AND TO RESTORE ALMOST EVERY PART OF THE ANCIENT SYSTEM UNDER HEW NAMES AND FORMS THE TITLE OF KING WAS NOT REVIVED
NOT MERELY AS A PLACE OF ARMS AND AS A KEY TO THE LOW COUNTRIES BUT ALSO AS A TROPHY OF ENGLISH VALOUR IT WAS TO THE SUBJECTS OF CHARLES WHAT CALAIS HAD BEEN TO AN EARLIER GENERATION AND WHAT THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR
SAW WITH INDIGNATION THE INCREASING SPLENDOUR AND PROFUSION OF WHITEHALL AND WERE IMMOVABLY FIXED IN THE BELIEF THAT THE MONEY WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE SUPPORTED THEIR HOUSEHOLDS HAD BY SOME INEXPLICABLE PROCESS
BUT CONSTANT TROUBLES WHICH MUST BE SUPPRESSED BY THE CONSTANT USE OF THE SWORD HE THEREFORE WISHED TO RESTORE IN ALL ESSENTIALS THAT ANCIENT CONSTITUTION WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND FOR WHICH THEY NOW PINED
HE MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HIS SCORN OF THE MIMICS
SINGULARLY UNFAVOURABLE TO THE HEALTH AND VIGOUR OF THE ENGLISH RACE BUT THE MURMURS EXCITED BY THESE ERRORS WERE FAINT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CLAMOURS WHICH SOON BROKE FORTH THE GOVERNMENT ENGAGED IN WAR WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES
REACTION WHICH NEVER CEASED TILL THE THRONE HAD AGAIN BEEN SET UP IN ALL ITS OLD DIGNITY AT FIRST HOWEVER THE SLAYERS OF THE KING SEEMED TO HAVE DERIVED NEW ENERGY FROM THAT SACRAMENT OF BLOOD BY WHICH THEY HAD BOUND THEMSELVES CLOSELY TOGETHER
ENCOMPASSED HIM THICK ON EVERY SIDE HAD HE BEEN A CRUEL LICENTIOUS AND RAPACIOUS PRINCE THE NATION MIGHT HAVE FOUND COURAGE IN DESPAIR AND MIGHT HAVE MADE A CONVULSIVE EFFORT TO FREE ITSELF FROM MILITARY DOMINATION
CROMWELL HAD TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE WOULD PUT TO HAZARD THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS PARTY THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS ARMY HIS OWN GREATNESS NAY HIS OWN LIFE IN AN ATTEMPT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN VAIN TO SAVE A PRINCE WHOM NO ENGAGEMENT COULD BIND
THE VICES OF THE OLD REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO SERIOUS AS THEY AFTERWARDS BECAME HAD ALREADY BEEN REMARKED BY FARSIGHTED MEN CROMWELL REFORMED THAT SYSTEM ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES ON WHICH MISTER PITT
DISGUSTED AND ALARMED HIM NOTHING WOULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO PUT THE GREAT SEAL TO A WRIT FOR RAISING SHIPMONEY OR TO GIVE HIS VOICE IN COUNCIL FOR COMMITTING A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO THE TOWER ON ACCOUNT OF WORDS SPOKEN IN DEBATE
THE ROYAL DIGNITY MIGHT DESCEND WITH GENERAL ACQUIESCENCE TO HIS POSTERITY THE ABLEST ROYALISTS WERE OF OPINION THAT THESE VIEWS WERE CORRECT AND THAT IF CROMWELL HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO FOLLOW HIS OWN JUDGMENT THE EXILED LINE WOULD NEVER
DREW ON HIM MUCH DESERVED AND SOME UNDESERVED CENSURE
THE AUSTERE PURITANS
GONE TO THE FAVOURITES OF THE KING THE MINDS OF MEN WERE NOW IN SUCH A TEMPER THAT EVERY PUBLIC ACT EXCITED DISCONTENT CHARLES HAD TAKEN TO WIFE CATHARINE PRINCESS OF PORTUGAL
AND SEPARATED THEMSELVES FOR EVER FROM THE GREAT BODY OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN ENGLAND WAS DECLARED A COMMONWEALTH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS REDUCED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF MEMBERS WAS NOMINALLY THE SUPREME POWER IN THE STATE IN FACT
HE HAD AT LEAST GIVEN HER GLORY IN EXCHANGE
IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS MERITS BUT IT HAD MODERATION ENOUGH TO ABSTAIN FROM THOSE OPPRESSIONS WHICH DRIVE MEN MAD AND IT HAD A FORCE AND ENERGY WHICH NONE BUT MEN DRIVEN MAD BY OPPRESSION WOULD VENTURE TO ENCOUNTER
BOTH OF CAVALIERS AND LEVELLERS THE LOYAL GENTRY DECLARED THAT THEY WERE STILL AS READY AS EVER TO RISK THEIR LIVES FOR THE OLD GOVERNMENT AND THE OLD DYNASTY IF THERE WERE THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF SUCCESS BUT TO RUSH
THE KING FEASTED WITH THE LADIES OF HIS SERAGLIO AND AMUSED HIMSELF WITH HUNTING A MOTH ABOUT THE SUPPER ROOM THEN AT LENGTH TARDY JUSTICE WAS DONE TO THE MEMORY OF OLIVER EVERYWHERE MEN MAGNIFIED HIS VALOUR
WAS A TASK TOO HARD FOR THAT ADMINISTRATION
A HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS A NECESSARY PART OF THE NEW POLITY IN CONSTITUTING THIS BODY THE PROTECTOR SHOWED A WISDOM AND A PUBLIC SPIRIT WHICH WERE NOT DULY APPRECIATED BY HIS CONTEMPORARIES
A REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL WAS CREATED THAT TRIBUNAL PRONOUNCED CHARLES A TYRANT A TRAITOR A MURDERER AND A PUBLIC ENEMY AND HIS HEAD WAS SEVERED FROM HIS SHOULDERS BEFORE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS IN FRONT OF THE BANQUETING HALL
THE FEW MEMBERS WHO MADE UP WHAT WAS CONTEMPTUOUSLY CALLED THE RUMP OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD NO MORE CLAIM THAN THE MILITARY CHIEFS TO BE ESTEEMED THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION THE DISPUTE WAS SOON BROUGHT TO A DECISIVE ISSUE CROMWELL FILLED THE HOUSE WITH ARMED MEN
AND WERE DISPOSED TO DOUBT WHETHER THE SULLEN PRECISENESS OF PRAISE GOD BAREBONE MIGHT NOT BE PREFERABLE TO THE OUTRAGEOUS PROFANENESS AND LICENTIOUSNESS OF THE BUCKINGHAMS AND SEDLEYS EVEN IMMORAL MEN
ASKED BY WHAT RIGHT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD BEEN PURGED OF ITS MOST RESPECTABLE MEMBERS AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS DEPRIVED OF ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS AND TOLD HIS WEEPING HEARERS THAT HE WAS DEFENDING NOT ONLY HIS OWN CAUSE BUT THEIRS
BUT THE GRIEVANCES WHICH THE COUNTRY SUFFERED THOUGH SUCH AS EXCITED SERIOUS DISCONTENT WERE BY NO MEANS SUCH AS IMPEL GREAT MASSES OF MEN TO STAKE THEIR LIVES THEIR FORTUNES AND THE WELFARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AGAINST FEARFUL ODDS
AND IF ONE THEN MARKS DOWN ONE'S THOUGHTS POETRY IS PRODUCED
AS INDEED ONE MUST DO ACCORDING TO THE DEMANDS OF THE WORLD AT PRESENT
EACH ONE KEPT TO HIS OWN OPINION AND SO THEY SEPARATED IT'S A STRANGE RACE THOSE POETS SAID THE CLERK WHO WAS VERY FOND OF SOLILOQUIZING I SHOULD LIKE SOME DAY JUST FOR A TRIAL TO TAKE SUCH NATURE UPON ME AND BE A POET MYSELF
NOW LET US SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO AMUSE OURSELVES THEY HAD GOT JUST SO FAR AND THE CONVERSATION BEGAN TO CRYSTALLISE AS IT COULD BUT DO WITH THE SCANTY STREAM WHICH THE COMMONPLACE WORLD SUPPLIED AMONGST OTHER THINGS THEY SPOKE OF THE MIDDLE AGES
BUT THE SHOES MEANWHILE REMAINED BEHIND FOUR A MOMENT OF HEAD IMPORTANCE AN EVENING'S DRAMATIC READINGS A MOST STRANGE JOURNEY EVERY INHABITANT OF COPENHAGEN KNOWS FROM PERSONAL INSPECTION HOW THE ENTRANCE TO FREDERICK'S HOSPITAL LOOKS
THEY POURED OUT THE LIQUOR AND MADE THE MOST FRIENDLY GESTICULATIONS WHILE A COLD PERSPIRATION TRICKLED DOWN THE BACK OF THE POOR COUNCILLOR WHAT'S TO BE THE END OF THIS WHAT'S TO BECOME OF ME
DOES YOUR HONOR WANT TO CROSS THE FERRY TO THE HOLME ASKED THEY ACROSS TO THE HOLME SAID THE COUNCILLOR WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE AT THAT MOMENT WAS NO I AM GOING TO CHRISTIANSHAFEN TO LITTLE MARKET STREET BOTH MEN STARED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
BUT WHAT SHE HAD YET TO PERFORM WAS SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL I MUST TELL YOU SAID SHE
AS TO A PAVEMENT I CAN FIND NO TRACES OF ONE AND ALL THE LAMPS IT SEEMS HAVE GONE TO SLEEP THE MOON WAS NOT YET VERY HIGH IT WAS BESIDES RATHER FOGGY SO THAT IN THE DARKNESS ALL OBJECTS SEEMED MINGLED IN CHAOTIC CONFUSION
WAS AGAIN SILENT GREAT HEAVEN WHAT IS COME TO ME
AS ON THE CONTINENT IN ALL LAW AND POLICE PRACTICES NOTHING IS VERBAL BUT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER TRIFLING IS REDUCED TO WRITING THE LABOR AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF PAPERS THAT THUS ACCUMULATE IS ENORMOUS
THE YOUNGER IT IS TRUE WAS NOT DAME FORTUNE HERSELF BUT ONE OF THE WAITING MAIDS OF HER HANDMAIDENS WHO CARRY ABOUT THE LESSER GOOD THINGS THAT SHE DISTRIBUTES THE OTHER LOOKED EXTREMELY GLOOMY IT WAS CARE SHE ALWAYS ATTENDS TO HER OWN SERIOUS BUSINESS HERSELF
EVERYDAY NECESSITY IS THE STAGNANT POOL OF LIFE NO LOVELY PICTURE REFLECTS ITSELF THEREIN LIEUTENANT LOVE AND LACK OF MONEY THAT IS A SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE OR MUCH THE SAME AS THE HALF OF THE SHATTERED DIE OF FORTUNE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR BORNHOLMISH DIALECT SAID HE AT LAST ANGRILY AND TURNING HIS BACK UPON THEM HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE BRIDGE THERE WAS NO RAILWAY EITHER IT IS REALLY DISGRACEFUL WHAT A STATE THIS PLACE IS IN MUTTERED HE TO HIMSELF
OH HE IS A HUNDRED TIMES HAPPIER THAN I
HE STOOD IN THE HANDSOMELY FURNISHED APARTMENT AND HELD BETWEEN HIS FINGERS A SMALL SHEET OF ROSE COLORED PAPER ON WHICH SOME VERSES WERE WRITTEN WRITTEN INDEED BY THE OFFICER HIMSELF
HE FOUND HOWEVER A LITTLE SIDE DOOR OPEN AND THROUGH THIS HE WENT AND STEPPED INTO OUR NEW MARKET OF THE PRESENT TIME IT WAS A HUGE DESOLATE PLAIN SOME WILD BUSHES STOOD UP HERE AND THERE WHILE ACROSS THE FIELD FLOWED A BROAD CANAL OR RIVER
THE COPYING CLERK TURNED ROUND AND SPOKE AWHILE WITH THE MAN ABOUT THE REPORTS AND LEGAL DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION BUT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED AND HIS EYE FELL AGAIN ON THE SHOES HE WAS UNABLE TO SAY WHETHER THOSE TO THE LEFT OR THOSE TO THE RIGHT BELONGED TO HIM
THE WHITE DOVE OF INNOCENCE FLUTTERED OVER THE ALTAR HOW GLADLY WOULD HE HAVE SUNK UPON HIS KNEES BUT HE MUST AWAY TO THE NEXT HEART
THE SWEET AIR CONTINUED HE OF THE POLICE OFFICE IN HIS DREAMY IMAGININGS HOW IT REMINDS ME OF THE VIOLETS IN THE GARDEN OF MY AUNT MAGDALENA YES THEN I WAS A LITTLE WILD BOY WHO DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL VERY REGULARLY O HEAVENS
WHOM WE HAVE CERTAINLY NOT FORGOTTEN THOUGHT MEANWHILE OF THE GALOSHES HE HAD FOUND AND TAKEN WITH HIM TO THE HOSPITAL
WITH SONGS AND HURRAHS THE ICE WAS SAWN ASUNDER THE SHIPS WERE FRESH TARRED AND RIGGED THAT THEY MIGHT SAIL AWAY TO DISTANT LANDS BUT I HAVE REMAINED HERE
AND FROM THE GREEN HERBAGE A FRAGRANCE IS EXHALED THAT FILLS ME WITH DELIGHT FOR MANY A YEAR HAVE I NOT FELT AS AT THIS MOMENT WE SEE ALREADY BY THE FOREGOING EFFUSION THAT HE IS BECOME A POET TO GIVE FURTHER PROOF OF IT HOWEVER WOULD IN MOST CASES BE INSIPID
THE COUNCILLOR IMAGINED IT WAS THE CHOLERA THAT WAS MEANT WHICH PEOPLE MADE SO MUCH FUSS ABOUT AND THE DISCOURSE PASSED OFF SATISFACTORILY ENOUGH
HE HAD ON THE SHOES FOR AS YET NO LAWFUL OWNER HAD APPEARED TO CLAIM THEM AND BESIDES IT WAS SO VERY DIRTY OUT OF DOORS THEY WERE JUST THE THING FOR HIM HE THOUGHT THE BEGINNING OF THE POEM HE PRAISED WITH GREAT GENEROSITY HE EVEN FOUND THE IDEA ORIGINAL AND EFFECTIVE
BESIDES HOW ASHAMED WOULD HE HAVE BEEN TO BE FOUND CAUGHT IN A TRAP LIKE AN OUTWITTED FOX HOW WAS HE TO TWIST HIMSELF THROUGH HE SAW CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HIS IRREVOCABLE DESTINY TO REMAIN A PRISONER TILL DAWN OR PERHAPS EVEN LATE IN THE MORNING
WITH A SICK BED RID MOTHER REVEALED BUT GOD'S WARM SUN STREAMED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW LOVELY ROSES NODDED FROM THE WOODEN FLOWER BOXES ON THE ROOF
BUT I'M CONDEMNED TO SILENCE OH POOR ME AS THOU DOST KNOW WHO ALL MEN'S HEARTS CANST SEE OH WERE I RICH IN CALM AND PEACE OF MIND MY GRIEF YOU THEN WOULD NOT HERE WRITTEN FIND
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE DECENT SHOP FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER NOTHING BUT WRETCHED HUTS CAN I SEE ANYWHERE JUST AS IF I WERE AT RINGSTEAD OH I AM ILL I CAN SCARCELY BEAR MYSELF ANY LONGER WHERE THE DEUCE CAN THE HOUSE BE
NEVER HAD HIS AGE WITH WHICH HOWEVER HE WAS ALWAYS GRUMBLING SEEMED SO MISERABLE AS ON THIS EVENING I'LL TAKE A HACKNEY COACH THOUGHT HE BUT WHERE WERE THE HACKNEY COACHES NOT ONE WAS TO BE SEEN
THE GOOD OLD SOUL SHE LIVED BEHIND THE EXCHANGE SHE ALWAYS HAD A FEW TWIGS OR GREEN SHOOTS IN WATER LET THE WINTER RAGE WITHOUT AS IT MIGHT THE VIOLETS EXHALED THEIR SWEET BREATH
HE THOUGHT OF THE DISTRESS AND AGONY HE HAD ENDURED AND PRAISED FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS HEART THE HAPPY REALITY OUR OWN TIME WHICH WITH ALL ITS DEFICIENCIES IS YET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT IN WHICH SO MUCH AGAINST HIS INCLINATION HE HAD LATELY BEEN THREE
BUT WITH ALL HIS CLOTHES ON IN HIS BOOTS AND GALOSHES WHILE THE HOT DROPS FELL SCALDING FROM THE CEILING ON HIS FACE HOLLOA CRIED HE LEAPING DOWN THE BATHING ATTENDANT ON HIS SIDE UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE BEHELD IN THE BATH A MAN COMPLETELY DRESSED
ALAS SIGHED HE I KNOW ONE IN WHICH ALL IS STATELY BUT THERE SITS ALREADY A SPRUCE YOUNG SHOPMAN WHICH IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S AMISS IN THE WHOLE SHOP ALL WOULD BE SPLENDIDLY DECKED OUT AND WE SHOULD HEAR
HAD THE WATCH THAT EVENING THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS YET DESPITE THESE TWO OBSTACLES THE YOUNG MAN WAS OBLIGED TO GO OUT IF IT WERE BUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND AS TO TELLING THE DOOR KEEPER ABOUT IT THAT HE THOUGHT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY
WOULD TO HEAVEN I COULD BUT CHANGE WITH HIM HOW HAPPY SHOULD I BE WHILE EXPRESSING HIS WISH THE CHARM OF THE SHOES WHICH HE HAD PUT ON BEGAN TO WORK THE WATCHMAN ENTERED INTO THE BEING AND NATURE OF THE LIEUTENANT
A VERY LARGE PARTY IN ORDER AS IS OFTEN THE CASE TO GET A RETURN INVITATION FROM THE OTHERS
BUT NOBODY CAME TO FETCH THE SHOES IN THE EVENING DRAMATIC READINGS WERE TO BE GIVEN AT THE LITTLE THEATRE IN KING STREET THE HOUSE WAS FILLED TO SUFFOCATION AND AMONG OTHER PIECES TO BE RECITED WAS A NEW POEM BY H C ANDERSEN CALLED MY AUNT'S SPECTACLES
A FEW PERSONS IN THE COSTUME OF THE TIME OF KING HANS PASSED QUICKLY BY HIM HOW STRANGE THEY LOOK THE GOOD FOLKS COME PROBABLY FROM A MASQUERADE
WHAT CHANGE WHAT MAGNIFICENCE YONDER IN THE CANAL LAY THE SHIPS FROZEN UP AND DESERTED BY THEIR WHOLE CREWS WITH A SCREAMING CROW FOR THE SOLE OCCUPANT BUT WHEN THE SPRING WITH A GENTLE STIRRING MOTION ANNOUNCED HER ARRIVAL A NEW AND BUSY LIFE AROSE
HE TOOK UPON HIM THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF THE OFFICER BUT AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN HE FELT HIMSELF IN HIS NEW SITUATION MUCH LESS CONTENTED AND NOW PREFERRED THE VERY THING WHICH BUT SOME MINUTES BEFORE HE HAD REJECTED SO THEN THE WATCHMAN WAS AGAIN WATCHMAN
MUST ALWAYS REMAIN HERE SITTING AT MY DESK IN THE OFFICE AND PATIENTLY SEE OTHER PEOPLE FETCH THEIR PASSPORTS TO GO ABROAD SUCH IS MY FATE
FOR IT IS A MOST FOOLISH NOTION TO FANCY A POET DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MEN AMONG THE LATTER THERE MAY BE FAR MORE POETICAL NATURES THAN MANY AN ACKNOWLEDGED POET WHEN EXAMINED MORE CLOSELY COULD BOAST OF
THAT IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE INTERESTING TRICK HE NEED ONLY REPAIR TO SOME PLACE WHERE A GREAT MANY PERSONS WERE ASSEMBLED AND THEN FROM A HIGHER POSITION WHENCE HE COULD OVERLOOK THE CROWD PASS THE COMPANY IN REVIEW BEFORE HIM THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES IMMEDIATELY
THE DIFFERENCE ONLY IS THAT THE POET POSSESSES A BETTER MENTAL MEMORY ON WHICH ACCOUNT HE IS ABLE TO RETAIN THE FEELING AND THE THOUGHT TILL THEY CAN BE EMBODIED BY MEANS OF WORDS A FACULTY WHICH THE OTHERS DO NOT POSSESS BUT THE TRANSITION FROM A COMMONPLACE NATURE
AND HE NOW REMEMBERED THE IMPORTANT EVENT OF THE EVENING BEFORE HOW HIS HEAD HAD GOT JAMMED IN BETWEEN THE IRON RAILINGS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT'S WHAT IT IS NO DOUBT SAID HE I MUST DO SOMETHING IN TIME UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A RUSSIAN BATH MIGHT DO ME GOOD
AS THEN SHE IS SURE OF HAVING IT DONE PROPERLY THEY WERE TELLING EACH OTHER WITH A CONFIDENTIAL INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN DURING THE DAY THE MESSENGER OF FORTUNE HAD ONLY EXECUTED A FEW UNIMPORTANT COMMISSIONS SUCH AS SAVING A NEW BONNET FROM A SHOWER OF RAIN ET CETERA
THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD A SORE CHEST AND A BLEEDING BACK AND EXCEPTING THE FRIGHT THAT WAS ALL THAT HE HAD GAINED BY THE SHOES OF FORTUNE FIVE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE COPYING CLERK THE WATCHMAN
WHOSE NAME IS CERTAIN TO BE FOUND IN THE DIRECTORY
BUT NO THAT WOULD BE TOO SILLY AND HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS IF THEY ARE UP STILL HE LOOKED FOR THE HOUSE BUT IT HAD VANISHED IT IS REALLY DREADFUL GROANED HE WITH INCREASING ANXIETY I CANNOT RECOGNISE EAST STREET AGAIN
WALK IN GENTLEMEN PRAY WALK IN HERE YOU WILL FIND ALL YOU PLEASE TO WANT AH I WISH TO HEAVEN I COULD WALK IN AND TAKE A TRIP RIGHT THROUGH THE HEARTS OF THOSE PRESENT AND BEHOLD TO THE SHOES OF FORTUNE THIS WAS THE CUE
THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE SITTING NEAREST HIM AND HEARD HIS SPEECH STARED AT HIM IN WONDERMENT AND ONE OF THEM ROSE TOOK OFF HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY AND SAID WITH A SERIOUS COUNTENANCE YOU ARE NO DOUBT A VERY LEARNED MAN MONSIEUR
SUCH A PAIR OF SHOES MUST BE VERY WARM AND COMFORTABLE SAID HE THE LEATHER IS SO SOFT AND SUPPLE THEY FITTED HIS FEET AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIM TIS A CURIOUS WORLD WE LIVE IN CONTINUED HE SOLILOQUIZING
THE FIRST HEART THROUGH WHICH HE CAME WAS THAT OF A MIDDLE AGED LADY BUT HE INSTANTLY FANCIED HIMSELF IN THE ROOM OF THE INSTITUTION FOR THE CURE OF THE CROOKED AND DEFORMED WHERE CASTS OF MIS SHAPEN LIMBS ARE DISPLAYED IN NAKED REALITY ON THE WALL
LONG HEADED PEOPLE GET THROUGH BEST SO MUCH THEN FOR THE INTRODUCTION ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHOSE HEAD IN A PHYSICAL SENSE ONLY MIGHT BE SAID TO BE OF THE THICKEST
SO HE PUT THEM ON THE QUESTION NOW WAS IF HE COULD SQUEEZE HIMSELF THROUGH THE GRATING FOR HE HAD NEVER TRIED BEFORE WELL THERE HE STOOD WOULD TO HEAVEN I HAD GOT MY HEAD THROUGH SAID HE INVOLUNTARILY
BUT DOUBLY CAREFUL MUST ONE BE WHEN WE HAVE THE SHOES OF FORTUNE ON OUR FEET NOW JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WATCHMAN
HE TURNED ROUND ANEW FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS SERIOUSLY ILL HE GAZED AT THE STREET FORMERLY SO WELL KNOWN TO HIM AND NOW SO STRANGE IN APPEARANCE AND LOOKED AT THE HOUSES MORE ATTENTIVELY MOST OF THEM WERE OF WOOD SLIGHTLY PUT TOGETHER AND MANY HAD A THATCHED ROOF NO
YET WE MAY BOLDLY ASSERT THAT THE SOUL IS SHREWDEST WHEN IT SHAKES OFF EVERY FETTER AND EVERY SORT OF LEADING STRING THE BODY ONLY MAKES IT STUPID THE SEEMINGLY DEAD BODY OF THE WATCHMAN WANDERED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE HOSPITAL
OH OH I REALLY CANNOT SQUEEZE MYSELF THROUGH HE NOW WANTED TO PULL HIS OVER HASTY HEAD BACK AGAIN BUT HE COULD NOT FOR HIS NECK THERE WAS ROOM ENOUGH BUT FOR NOTHING MORE HIS FIRST FEELING WAS OF ANGER HIS NEXT THAT HIS TEMPER FELL TO ZERO
WHICH I AM TO CARRY TO MANKIND THESE SHOES POSSESS THE PROPERTY OF INSTANTLY TRANSPORTING HIM WHO HAS THEM ON TO THE PLACE OR THE PERIOD IN WHICH HE MOST WISHES TO BE EVERY WISH AS REGARDS TIME OR PLACE OR STATE OF BEING WILL BE IMMEDIATELY FULFILLED AND SO AT LAST MAN WILL BE HAPPY HERE BELOW
THIS THE LIEUTENANT FELT MOST POIGNANTLY AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE LEANT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW AND SIGHED SO DEEPLY
AND THE FIRST THING THAT WAS DONE HERE WAS NATURALLY TO PULL OFF THE GALOSHES WHEN THE SPIRIT THAT WAS MERELY GONE OUT ON ADVENTURES MUST HAVE RETURNED WITH THE QUICKNESS OF LIGHTNING TO ITS EARTHLY TENEMENT IT TOOK ITS DIRECTION TOWARDS THE BODY IN A STRAIGHT LINE
WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW THE PALE MOON SHEDDING A LONG STREAM OF WHITE LIGHT ON THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE LIKE A SPECTRE I LEANED AGAINST THE WALL AND NEARLY SHRIEKED I SEEMED TO BE GOING MAD AT LAST I MASTERED MY AGITATION
ALWAYS THE SAME ALWAYS THE CHILD'S CORPSE COMING EVERY NIGHT IN MY DREAMS RISING FROM THE EARTH AND HOVERING OVER THE GRAVE WITH MENACING LOOK AND GESTURE I INQUIRED IMMEDIATELY ON MY RETURN TO PARIS THE HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN INHABITED SINCE WE LEFT IT
NIGHT ARRIVED I ALLOWED IT TO BECOME QUITE DARK I WAS WITHOUT A LIGHT IN THAT ROOM WHEN THE WIND SHOOK ALL THE DOORS BEHIND WHICH I CONTINUALLY EXPECTED TO SEE SOME SPY CONCEALED I TREMBLED
SHE WAS VERY PLAINLY DRESSED AS WOULD BE THE CASE WITH A WOMAN OF TASTE WALKING IN THE MORNING
AND YOU ALMOST DYING YOURSELF CAME TO MEET ME WE WERE OBLIGED TO KEEP SILENT UPON THE DREADFUL CATASTROPHE YOU HAD THE FORTITUDE TO REGAIN THE HOUSE ASSISTED BY YOUR NURSE A DUEL WAS THE PRETEXT FOR MY WOUND
AND THEN FLUNG IT DOWN IN HASTE SCARCELY HAD I COVERED IT WITH EARTH WHEN THE ARM OF THE CORSICAN WAS STRETCHED TOWARDS ME I SAW A SHADOW RISE AND AT THE SAME TIME A FLASH OF LIGHT I FELT PAIN
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE PATH WHICH LED TO THE LITTLE GATE BUT THIS EXAMINATION WAS AS USELESS AS THE FIRST AND WITH A BURSTING HEART I RETURNED TO THE THICKET WHICH NOW CONTAINED NO HOPE FOR ME OH CRIED MADAME DANGLARS
IT WAS THE END OF NOVEMBER ALL THE VERDURE OF THE GARDEN HAD DISAPPEARED THE TREES WERE NOTHING MORE THAN SKELETONS WITH THEIR LONG BONY ARMS AND THE DEAD LEAVES SOUNDED ON THE GRAVEL UNDER MY FEET MY TERROR OVERCAME ME TO SUCH A DEGREE AS I APPROACHED THE THICKET
DESCRIBING A HALF CIRCLE WITH HIS CHAIR SO AS TO PLACE HIMSELF EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO MADAME DANGLARS IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SPEAKING ALONE WITH YOU AND I REGRET THAT WE HAVE ONLY NOW MET TO ENTER UPON A PAINFUL CONVERSATION
IF I DRIVE AWAY THREE OR FOUR HEAD OF CATTLE EVERY DAY I SHALL SOON BECOME POOR SO FROM THAT TIME HE LOOKED OUT FOR ANY STRAYING CATTLE AND WOULD DRIVE THEM HOME WITH HIS OWN IF THE OWNER CLAIMED THEM HE GAVE THEM UP
I HAD TURNED UP THE EARTH OVER A SURFACE OF MORE THAN TWENTY FEET SQUARE AND A DEPTH OF TWO FEET A LABORER WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IN A DAY WHAT OCCUPIED ME AN HOUR BUT I COULD FIND NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEN I RENEWED THE SEARCH SUPPOSING IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE
AND I DID NOT DARE INQUIRE FOR YOU WHEN I RETURNED TO PARIS I LEARNED THAT YOU
HIS MOTHER WASHED HIS CLOTHES FOR HIM AND GAVE HIM FOOD FOR THE JOURNEY AND HE SET OUT ON THE WAY HE MET A MAN WHO ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING AND HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A PETITION TO SINGH CHANDO THEN SAID THE MAN MAKE A PETITION FOR ME ALSO
THE MEANS WE MIGHT HAVE USED WHICH WE IN OUR BLINDNESS COULD NOT SEE THEN SEEM SIMPLE AND EASY AND WE SAY WHY DID I NOT DO THIS INSTEAD OF THAT WOMEN ON THE CONTRARY ARE RARELY TORMENTED WITH REMORSE
WOULD HE NOT ONE DAY MAKE YOU PAY FOR KEEPING THIS TERRIBLE SECRET WOULD IT NOT BE A SWEET REVENGE FOR HIM WHEN HE FOUND THAT I HAD NOT DIED FROM THE BLOW OF HIS DAGGER IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE AND AT ALL RISKS
I UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD NOTHING TO FEAR THAT I SHOULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD SO I DECIDED UPON DESCENDING TO THE GARDEN
SHE WAS LEFT WELL OFF AND AMONG HER PROPERTY WERE THREE GOLD COINS AND AS SHE WAS AFRAID OF THESE BEING STOLEN SHE DECIDED TO PLACE THEM IN THE CARE OF THE VILLAGE HEADMAN SO SHE TOOK THEM TO HIM AND ASKED HIM TO KEEP THEM TILL HER CHILD WAS BORN
THOUGH I HAD MADE A HOLE TWICE AS LARGE AS THE FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN DECEIVED HAD MISTAKEN THE SPOT I TURNED AROUND I LOOKED AT THE TREES I TRIED TO RECALL THE DETAILS WHICH HAD STRUCK ME AT THE TIME
MADAME DANGLARS HAD RISEN AND STOOD BEFORE THE PROCUREUR WHOSE HANDS SHE WRUNG IN HER FEEBLE GRASP I KNOW NOT I MERELY SUPPOSE SO AS I MIGHT SUPPOSE ANYTHING ELSE REPLIED VILLEFORT WITH A LOOK SO FIXED
DOUBTLESS IT IS CHANCE CHANCE
NEVERTHELESS SIR YOU SEE I HAVE ANSWERED YOUR FIRST APPEAL ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY THE CONVERSATION MUST BE MUCH MORE PAINFUL FOR ME THAN FOR YOU
THEN THE YOUTH ASKED ABOUT THE TWO MEN HE HAD MET SINGH CHANDO SAID TELL THE FIRST MAN WHEN HE IS PLOUGHING TO PLOUGH TWO OR THREE FURROWS BEYOND THE BOUNDARY OF HIS FIELD AND HIS WEALTH WILL DIMINISH
OUTSIDE THIS DOOR A SPADE WAS PLACED AGAINST THE WALL I TOOK IT AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE THICKET I HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A DARK LANTERN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAWN I STOPPED TO LIGHT IT THEN I CONTINUED MY PATH
THE BARONESS KNEW HOW CALM VILLEFORT NATURALLY WAS AND HIS PRESENT EXCITEMENT FRIGHTENED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SCREAM BUT THE SOUND DIED IN HER THROAT HOW HAS THIS TERRIBLE PAST BEEN RECALLED CRIED VILLEFORT
WHAT THEN ASKED HERMINE TREMBLING VIOLENTLY SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE MORE FATAL MORE ALARMING FOR US THE CHILD WAS PERHAPS ALIVE AND THE ASSASSIN MAY HAVE SAVED IT
IT IS GENERALLY THE CASE THAT WHAT WE MOST ARDENTLY DESIRE IS AS ARDENTLY WITHHELD FROM US BY THOSE WHO WISH TO OBTAIN IT OR FROM WHOM WE ATTEMPT TO SNATCH IT THUS THE GREATER NUMBER OF A MAN'S ERRORS
IF MY HEART BE PETRIFIED IT IS THAT IT MIGHT SUSTAIN THE BLOWS IT HAS RECEIVED I WAS NOT SO IN MY YOUTH I WAS NOT SO ON THE NIGHT OF THE BETROTHAL
THANKS MADAME THANKS FOR YOUR PUNCTUALITY AND HE OFFERED A CHAIR TO MADAME DANGLARS WHICH SHE ACCEPTED FOR HER HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE FELT NEARLY SUFFOCATED IT IS A LONG TIME MADAME SAID THE PROCUREUR
AND HAD LEFT HOME IN THE CARRIAGE SHE DIRECTED HER COURSE TOWARDS THE FAUBOURG SAINT GERMAIN WENT DOWN THE RUE MAZARINE AND STOPPED AT THE PASSAGE DU PONT NEUF SHE DESCENDED AND WENT THROUGH THE PASSAGE
THE INSTANT SHE APPEARED THE DOOR KEEPER ROSE CAME TO HER AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS NOT THE PERSON WITH WHOM THE PROCUREUR HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT AND ON HER AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER BEING GIVEN
A COLD SHARP WIND WHISTLED THROUGH THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES AND YET THE DROPS FELL FROM MY FOREHEAD I RECOLLECTED THAT I WAS STABBED JUST AS I WAS TRAMPLING THE GROUND TO FILL UP THE HOLE WHILE DOING SO I HAD LEANED AGAINST A LABURNUM
THAT HER WHITE COMPLEXION AND BRILLIANT EYES WERE ALONE VISIBLE THE CAB CROSSED THE PONT NEUF AND ENTERED THE RUE DE HARLAY BY THE PLACE DAUPHINE THE DRIVER WAS PAID AS THE DOOR OPENED
ALAS NO I KNOW NOT A WOMAN ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER CAME TO CLAIM IT WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THE NAPKIN THIS WOMAN GAVE ALL THE REQUISITE PARTICULARS AND IT WAS INTRUSTED TO HER BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE INQUIRED FOR THE WOMAN YOU SHOULD HAVE TRACED HER
THENCE I PASSED ON TO THE RHONE WHENCE I DESCENDED MERELY WITH THE CURRENT TO ARLES AT ARLES I WAS AGAIN PLACED ON MY LITTER AND CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TO MARSEILLES MY RECOVERY LASTED SIX MONTHS I NEVER HEARD YOU MENTIONED
THE MAGISTRATE WAS SEATED IN AN ARM CHAIR WRITING WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THE DOOR HE DID NOT MOVE AS HE HEARD IT OPEN AND THE DOOR KEEPER PRONOUNCE THE WORDS WALK IN MADAME AND THEN RECLOSE IT
BUT SINCE THEN EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED IN AND ABOUT ME I AM ACCUSTOMED TO BRAVE DIFFICULTIES AND IN THE CONFLICT TO CRUSH THOSE WHO BY THEIR OWN FREE WILL OR BY CHANCE VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY INTERFERE WITH ME IN MY CAREER
IF SHE KNEW HOW TO CHOOSE A WIFE AND ALSO WHAT SORT OF CATTLE TO BUY AND SHE SAID THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER HUSBAND HAD NOT TOLD HER THIS SO THE YOUTH SAID THAT HE WOULD GO TO SINGH CHANDO AND ASK
IF I PLOUGH OVER THE BOUNDARY ON TO MY NEIGHBOUR'S LAND IT WILL BE A GREAT SIN AND I SHALL SOON BECOME POOR AND HE WENT TO HIS PLOUGHMEN AND TOLD THEM NEVER TO PLOUGH RIGHT UP TO THE EDGE OF THE FIELD BUT TO LEAVE TWO OF THREE FURROWS SPACE
BEHIND ME WAS AN ARTIFICIAL ROCKERY INTENDED TO SERVE AS A RESTING PLACE FOR PERSONS WALKING IN THE GARDEN IN FALLING MY HAND RELAXING ITS HOLD OF THE LABURNUM FELT THE COLDNESS OF THE STONE ON MY RIGHT I SAW THE TREE BEHIND ME THE ROCK
IT IS TRUE THEN HE SAID RATHER UTTERING HIS THOUGHTS ALOUD THAN ADDRESSING HIS COMPANION IT IS TRUE THEN
VILLEFORT'S ONLY ANSWER WAS A STIFLED GROAN BUT THE CHILD THE CHILD SIR REPEATED THE AGITATED MOTHER HOW I HAVE SEARCHED FOR HIM REPLIED VILLEFORT WRINGING HIS HANDS HOW I HAVE CALLED HIM IN MY LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
DOUBTLESS HE IS CAPRICIOUS BUT THAT IS ALL ONE THING ALONE STRUCK ME OF ALL THE EXQUISITE THINGS HE PLACED BEFORE US HE TOUCHED NOTHING I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED HE WAS POISONING US AND YOU SEE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED
BUT LISTEN TO ME LISTEN AND YOU WILL PITY ME WHO HAS FOR TWENTY YEARS ALONE BORNE THE HEAVY BURDEN OF GRIEF I AM ABOUT TO REVEAL WITHOUT CASTING THE LEAST PORTION UPON YOU OH YOU FRIGHTEN ME BUT SPEAK I WILL LISTEN YOU RECOLLECT THAT SAD NIGHT
VILLEFORT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS DO I KNOW SAID HE AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF I KNEW
I RAN TO THE HOSPITAL AND LEARNED THAT THE SAME NIGHT THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER A CHILD HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE WRAPPED IN PART OF A FINE LINEN NAPKIN PURPOSELY TORN IN HALF THIS PORTION OF THE NAPKIN WAS MARKED WITH HALF A BARON'S CROWN
TO ANY ONE LIVING I MEAN YES YES I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL EJACULATED THE BARONESS NEVER I SWEAR TO YOU WERE YOU EVER IN THE HABIT OF WRITING IN THE EVENING WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED IN THE MORNING DO YOU KEEP A JOURNAL
AND HE PROMISED AND WENT ON AND CAME TO SINGH CHANDO AND THERE HE ASKED HOW TO CHOOSE A WIFE AND HOW TO BUY CATTLE AND SINGH CHANDO SAID
IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE YOU MAD I HOPED FOR A MOMENT THAT IT MIGHT SAID VILLEFORT BUT THAT HAPPINESS WAS DENIED ME HOWEVER RECOVERING MY STRENGTH AND MY IDEAS WHY SAID I SHOULD THAT MAN HAVE CARRIED AWAY THE CORPSE
WHEN YOU WERE HALF EXPIRING ON THAT BED IN THE RED DAMASK ROOM WHILE I SCARCELY LESS AGITATED THAN YOU AWAITED YOUR DELIVERY THE CHILD WAS BORN WAS GIVEN TO ME MOTIONLESS BREATHLESS VOICELESS WE THOUGHT IT DEAD
I STOOD IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AND THREW MYSELF DOWN I ROSE AND AGAIN BEGAN DIGGING AND ENLARGING THE HOLE STILL I FOUND NOTHING NOTHING THE CHEST WAS NO LONGER THERE THE CHEST NO LONGER THERE MURMURED MADAME DANGLARS CHOKING WITH FEAR
THE VILLAGERS WERE VERY SORRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT THE HEADMAN AND HIS WIFE ABUSED THEM FOR NOT HAVING BELIEVED THEIR WORD THE WOMAN HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE SHE MET A STRANGER WHO ASKED WHY SHE WAS CRYING AND WHEN SHE TOLD HIM HE SAID
WALKING SIX LEAGUES A DAY MADAME DE VILLEFORT FOLLOWED THE LITTER IN HER CARRIAGE
WHEN YOU BUY A BULLOCK FIRST PUT YOUR HAND ON ITS QUARTER AND IF IT SHRINKS AND TRIES TO GET FREE BUY IT AND WHEN YOU WANT A WIFE ENQUIRE FIRST AS TO THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER GOOD PARENTS MAKE GOOD CHILDREN
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND DIED WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT AND SHE WAS VERY UNHAPPY
WE KNOW OF NO GOLD COINS WHERE ARE YOUR WITNESSES YOU MUST HAVE HAD WITNESSES IN SUCH A BUSINESS AND THEY DROVE HER OUT SHE WENT AWAY CRYING AND CALLED THE VILLAGERS TOGETHER AND ASKED THEM TO DECIDE THE MATTER SO THEY QUESTIONED HER AND THE HEADMAN
HOW I HAVE LONGED FOR ROYAL WEALTH TO PURCHASE A MILLION OF SECRETS FROM A MILLION OF MEN AND TO FIND MINE AMONG THEM AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME I TOOK UP MY SPADE I ASKED MYSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN
BUT IT HAD JUST BEEN LET FOR NINE YEARS I FOUND THE TENANT I PRETENDED THAT I DISLIKED THE IDEA THAT A HOUSE BELONGING TO MY WIFE'S FATHER AND MOTHER SHOULD PASS INTO THE HANDS OF STRANGERS
THE PATHS OF WHICH YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING HAVE BEEN TRACED BY ALL YOUNG MEN OF ARDENT IMAGINATIONS BESIDES THE PLEASURE THERE IS ALWAYS REMORSE FROM THE INDULGENCE OF OUR PASSIONS AND AFTER ALL WHAT HAVE YOU MEN TO FEAR FROM ALL THIS
MY CHILD WAS ALIVE SAID SHE YOU BURIED MY CHILD ALIVE
IT INDICATED THAT HIS POWERFUL MIND WAS ON THE VERGE OF DESPAIR AND MADNESS AH MY CHILD MY POOR CHILD CRIED THE BARONESS FALLING ON HER CHAIR AND STIFLING HER SOBS IN HER HANDKERCHIEF VILLEFORT BECOMING SOMEWHAT REASSURED
THE MASTER SAID A MAN AND HIS FAULTS ARE OF A PIECE BY WATCHING HIS FAULTS WE LEARN WHETHER LOVE BE HIS EIGHT THE MASTER SAID
IF YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KEEPING YOUR CREAM COOL IN HOT WEATHER IT OUGHT TO BE CHURNED TWICE A WEEK THE EARLIER IN THE MORNING THE BETTER ALWAYS PUT COLD WATER IN YOUR CHURN THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU USE IT AND CHANGE IT IN THE MORNING JUST BEFORE YOU PUT IN THE CREAM
WASH AND WIPE THE VAT PUT IN A CLEAN CLOTH AND TURN IN THE CHEESE UPSIDE DOWN
MENG WU ASKED WHETHER TZU LU HAD LOVE
OBTAINED BY POST FROM A SECOND HAND BOOKSELLER HE ABANDONED THE NOW FAMILIAR IONIC FOR A NEW DIALECT AND FOR A LONG TIME ONWARD LIMITED HIS READING ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE GOSPELS AND EPISTLES IN GRIESBACH'S TEXT
THE APPEARANCE OF ACHILLES UNARMED AND HIS HEAVENLY ARMOUR IN THE EIGHTEENTH AND THE FUNERAL GAMES IN THE TWENTY THIRD
SHE BROUGHT AS BY MAGIC UPON ITS SMOOTH AND ROTUND SURFACE A PERFECT DIMPLE WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO RETAIN THERE AS LONG AS SHE CONTINUED TO SMILE THIS PRODUCTION OF DIMPLES AT WILL
I DIDN'T THROW IT I TELL YOU ASSERTED ONE GIRL TO HER NEIGHBOUR AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S PRESENCE NOR I THE SECOND ANSWERED OH ANNY HOW CAN YOU SAID THE THIRD
AS A WOMAN IS SINGLED OUT IN SUCH CASES FOR NO REASONED PURPOSE OF FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE BUT IN COMMONPLACE OBEDIENCE TO CONJUNCTIVE ORDERS FROM HEADQUARTERS
AND JUDE WAS LOST TO ALL CONDITIONS OF THINGS IN THE ADVENT OF A FRESH AND WILD PLEASURE THAT OF HAVING FOUND A NEW CHANNEL FOR EMOTIONAL INTEREST HITHERTO UNSUSPECTED THOUGH IT HAD LAIN CLOSE BESIDE HIM
INSTEAD OF BY HAILING HIM BUT SHE SLYLY LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
IT WAS THEN VERY SWEET AND GOOD IT WILL NOT DO TO USE FOR A MONTH BECAUSE EARLIER THE SALTS WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY BLENDED WITH IT IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN WOODEN VESSELS OR NICE STONE JARS EARTHEN WARE JARS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR BUTTER
JUDE ASKED POLITELY ACCEPTING HER ASSERTION THOUGH HE HAD VERY LARGE DOUBTS AS TO ITS TRUTH IMPUDENCE DON'T TELL FOLK IT WAS I MIND HOW CAN I I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME AH NO
WHEN PUT ON THE TOP A SMALL MUSLIN BAG FILLED WITH SALT AND TIE THE JAR UP CLOSE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE BUTTER IN A COOL PLACE A GREAT DEAL DEPENDS ON THE BUTTER BEING WELL WORKED PERSONS THAT HAVE LARGE DAIRIES SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A MACHINE TO WORK IT
TWENTY SIX
CH'ANG IS PASSIONATE HOW CAN HE BE FIRM ELEVEN TZU KUNG SAID
PUT MORE ON IN TWO DAYS KEEP IT IN A COLD PLACE IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS IT WILL DO TO STRETCH ON STICKS HANG IT UP IN A DRY COOL PLACE WITH AS MUCH SALT AS WILL STICK TO IT WHEN QUITE DRY PUT IT IN A PAPER BAG AND HANG IT UP
AN ADROIT LITTLE SUCK TO THE INTERIOR OF EACH OF HER CHEEKS IN SUCCESSION
AS DURING THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE SALTS THEY CORRODE THE GLAZING AND THE BUTTER BECOMES RANCID AND UNHEALTHY A FRIEND OF MINE AND A LADY OF MUCH EXPERIENCE REMARKED ON READING THE ABOVE
LOOKING AT THE GROUND AS THOUGH THE FUTURE WERE THROWN THEREON BY A MAGIC LANTERN ON A SUDDEN SOMETHING SMACKED HIM SHARPLY IN THE EAR AND HE BECAME AWARE THAT A SOFT COLD SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN FLUNG AT HIM
HAVING PROMISED TO CALL AT A FLOUR MILL NEAR CRESSCOMBE TO EXECUTE A COMMISSION FOR HIS AUNT HE WAS IN AN ENTHUSIASTIC MOOD HE SEEMED TO SEE HIS WAY TO LIVING COMFORTABLY IN CHRISTMINSTER IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR OR TWO AND KNOCKING AT THE DOORS OF ONE OF THOSE STRONGHOLDS OF LEARNING
AND I'LL BE HER BELOVED SON IN WHOM SHE SHALL BE WELL PLEASED IN HIS DEEP CONCENTRATION ON THESE TRANSACTIONS OF THE FUTURE JUDE'S WALK HAD SLACKENED AND HE WAS NOW STANDING QUITE STILL
A LAND OF A THOUSAND CHARIOTS MIGHT GIVE YU CHARGE OF ITS LEVIES
BUTTER CHEESE COFFEE TEA
NO MORE NO LESS AND JUDE WAS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT TO HER WAS ATTRIBUTABLE THE ENTERPRISE OF ATTRACTING HIS ATTENTION FROM DREAMS OF THE HUMANER LETTERS TO WHAT WAS SIMMERING IN THE MINDS AROUND HIM THAT YOU'LL NEVER BE TOLD
PLATO ARISTOTLE LUCRETIUS EPICTETUS SENECA ANTONINUS THEN I MUST MASTER OTHER THINGS THE FATHERS THOROUGHLY
IT IS BEST TO HAVE ONE KETTLE OR BASKET TO PUT THE BUTTER IN THAT IS USED AT THE TABLE IT SHOULD BE DEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD FIVE OR SIX PLATES EACH COVERED WITH A SAUCER IT CAN BE KEPT IN THIS WAY AS FIRM AND SWEET AS IN AN ICE HOUSE
WHO HAD DRAWN HIM TO HER WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD ASSERT MERE SPORTIVENESS ON HIS PART AS HIS REASON IN SEEKING HER SOMETHING IN HER QUITE ANTIPATHETIC TO THAT SIDE OF HIM WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED WITH LITERARY STUDY AND THE MAGNIFICENT CHRISTMINSTER DREAM
AT THIS MEMORABLE DATE OF HIS LIFE HE WAS ONE SATURDAY RETURNING FROM ALFREDSTON TO MARYGREEN ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT WAS FINE WARM AND SOFT SUMMER WEATHER AND HE WALKED WITH HIS TOOLS AT HIS BACK
YOU MAY MAKE CHEESE TWICE A WEEK AND STILL HAVE BUTTER FOR THE FAMILY YOU SHOULD KEEP FOUR THIN CLOTHS ON PURPOSE FOR CHEESE PENNSYLVANIA CREAM CHEESE THE CHEESE CALLED BY THIS NAME IS NOT IN REALITY MADE OF CREAM
THREE YOUNG WOMEN WERE KNEELING WITH BUCKETS AND PLATTERS BESIDE THEM CONTAINING HEAPS OF PIGS CHITTERLINGS WHICH THEY WERE WASHING IN THE RUNNING WATER
THE ONLY COPIES HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO LAY HANDS ON WERE OLD DELPHIN EDITIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE SUPERSEDED AND THEREFORE CHEAP
HE INCLINED TO THEY BUILT IN A CITY THEREFORE HE WOULD LEARN TO BUILD HE THOUGHT OF HIS UNKNOWN UNCLE HIS COUSIN SUSANNA'S FATHER AN ECCLESIASTICAL WORKER IN METAL AND SOMEHOW
THE SAME PIECE SALTED AND DRIED WILL DO SEVERAL TIMES COTTAGE CHEESE OR SMEARCASE
PERSONS WITH WEAK NERVES SHOULD NEVER DRINK STRONG TEA AND COFFEE I HAVE KNOWN INSTANCES OF PERSONS BEING AFFLICTED WITH VIOLENT ATTACKS OF NERVOUS HEAD ACHE
FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW LONG BUT HAD SOMEHOW BEEN DIVIDED FROM HIS ACTUAL BREATHING AS BY A SHEET OF GLASS THE INTENTIONS AS TO READING WORKING AND LEARNING WHICH HE HAD SO PRECISELY FORMULATED ONLY A FEW MINUTES EARLIER
AND REPEATING THE ODD LITTLE SUCKING OPERATION BEFORE MENTIONED JUDE BEING STILL UNCONSCIOUS OF MORE THAN A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF HER APPEARANCE NEXT SUNDAY HE HAZARDED TO MORROW THAT IS YES
FIRST IMPORTANCE THAT EVERY THING CONNECTED WITH MILK AND BUTTER SHOULD BE KEPT CLEAN IF THE MILK ACQUIRES AN UNPLEASANT TASTE IT COMMUNICATES IT TO THE BUTTER TIN PANS ARE BEST TO KEEP MILK IN
ON A DAY WHEN FAWLEY WAS GETTING QUITE ADVANCED BEING NOW ABOUT SIXTEEN
IF YOU HAVE A LARGE FAMILY BY USING SEVERAL PANS SIX POUNDS OF COFFEE CAN THUS BE ROASTED AND BUT LITTLE TIME SPENT ON IT BOILING COFFEE A LARGE TEA CUPFUL OF UNGROUND COFFEE WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR SIX PERSONS
OR HATE OTHERS FOUR THE MASTER SAID
JUDE FAWLEY SHOULDERED HIS TOOL BASKET AND RESUMED HIS LONELY WAY FILLED WITH AN ARDOUR AT WHICH HE MENTALLY STOOD AT GAZE HE HAD JUST INHALED A SINGLE BREATH FROM A NEW ATMOSPHERE WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN HANGING ROUND HIM EVERYWHERE HE WENT
AND THESE GIRLS ARE HELPING ME WASH THE INNERDS FOR BLACK PUDDINGS AND SUCH LIKE THEY TALKED A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AS THEY STOOD REGARDING EACH OTHER AND LEANING AGAINST THE HAND RAIL OF THE BRIDGE THE UNVOICED CALL OF WOMAN TO MAN
ONE GOOD WORKING ANSWERS VERY WELL FOR BUTTER IN WINTER ALWAYS SCALD THE CHURN BEFORE YOU PUT IN THE CREAM IN COLD WEATHER TO PUT UP BUTTER FOR WINTER WORK IT WELL AND SALT IT RATHER MORE THAN FOR TABLE USE
SHALL WELCOME WHOM NOW IT WOULD SPURN IF I WAIT TWENTY YEARS FOR THE WELCOME I'LL BE D D BEFORE I HAVE DONE
THREE THE MASTER SAID
AND LIVE SUMPTUOUSLY FOR HIM ON THE REMAINDER WELL ON SECOND THOUGHTS A BISHOP WAS ABSURD HE WOULD DRAW THE LINE AT AN ARCHDEACON
BY MEANS OF A STRAP ATTACHED TO THE TILT THE VOLUME HE WAS READING SPREAD THE DICTIONARY ON HIS KNEES AND PLUNGE INTO THE SIMPLER PASSAGES FROM CAESAR VIRGIL OR HORACE AS THE CASE MIGHT BE IN HIS PURBLIND STUMBLING WAY
ULTIMATELY HE DECIDED THAT IN HIS SHEER LOVE OF READING HE HAD TAKEN UP A WRONG EMOTION FOR A CHRISTIAN YOUNG MAN HE HAD DABBLED IN CLARKE'S HOMER BUT HAD NEVER YET WORKED MUCH AT THE NEW TESTAMENT IN THE GREEK THOUGH HE POSSESSED A COPY
I HAVE ACQUIRED QUITE AN AVERAGE STUDENT'S POWER TO READ THE COMMON ANCIENT CLASSICS LATIN IN PARTICULAR
AS JUDE HAD TO GET UP AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO HEAT THE OVEN AND MIX AND SET IN THE BREAD THAT HE DISTRIBUTED LATER IN THE DAY HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO BED AT NIGHT IMMEDIATELY AFTER LAYING THE SPONGE SO THAT IF HE COULD NOT READ HIS CLASSICS ON THE HIGHWAYS
BEGIN BY PUTTING A LAYER OF THE PRINTS IN THE BOTTOM OF A STONE POT PRESS THE BUTTER DOWN CLOSE SO THAT NO CAVITIES FOR THE ADMISSION OF AIR MAY REMAIN THEN STREW MORE OF THE MIXTURE OVER IT PROCEED IN THIS MANNER UNTIL THE VESSEL IS FILLED
WHEN IT IS NEAR BOILING PUT IT IN THE TUB WITH THE NEW MILK AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT'S MILK IT SHOULD BE RATHER MORE THAN MILK WARM
MANY PERSONS USE COFFEE ROASTERS BUT SOME OLD EXPERIENCED HOUSEKEEPERS THINK THAT THE FINE FLAVOR FLIES OFF MORE THAN WHEN DONE IN A DUTCH OVEN AND CONSTANTLY STIRRED IF YOU ARE CAREFUL IT CAN BE DONE VERY WELL IN THE DRIPPING PAN OF A STOVE
IN SPITE OF SUCH OBSTINACIES AS HE NOW KNEW THEM INHERENTLY TO POSSESS WAS A HERCULEAN PERFORMANCE WHICH GRADUALLY LED HIM ON TO A GREATER INTEREST IN IT THAN IN THE PRESUPPOSED PATENT PROCESS
HERODOTUS AESCHYLUS SOPHOCLES ARISTOPHANES
SPREAD A THIN LINEN CLOTH OVER THE TOP AND AS THE WHEY RISES DIP IT OFF WITH A SAUCER PUT THE CURD AS WHOLE AS POSSIBLE INTO A CHEESE HOOP ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DINNER PLATE FIRST SPREADING A WET CLOTH INSIDE THEN FOLD THE CLOTH SMOOTHLY OVER THE TOP
PUT ABOUT TWO POUNDS IN A PAN STIR IT A FEW TIMES IT WILL ROAST GRADUALLY AND IF NOT SUFFICIENTLY BROWN FINISH IN A STOVE OR BEFORE THE FIRE
MAY HAVE HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BECOMING A SCHOLAR BY THESE ROUGH AND READY MEANS HE WAS IN THE WAY OF GETTING INTO THE GROOVE HE WISHED TO FOLLOW WHILE HE WAS BUSIED WITH THESE ANCIENT PAGES WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN THUMBED BY HANDS POSSIBLY IN THE GRAVE
HERE JUDE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING AT LEAST THE RUDIMENTS OF FREESTONE WORKING SOME TIME LATER HE WENT TO A CHURCH BUILDER IN THE SAME PLACE AND UNDER THE ARCHITECT'S DIRECTION BECAME HANDY AT RESTORING THE DILAPIDATED MASONRIES OF SEVERAL VILLAGE CHURCHES ROUND ABOUT
WAS A NOT UNKNOWN OPERATION WHICH MANY ATTEMPTED BUT ONLY A FEW SUCCEEDED IN ACCOMPLISHING THEY MET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLANK AND JUDE TOSSING BACK HER MISSILE SEEMED TO EXPECT HER TO EXPLAIN WHY SHE HAD AUDACIOUSLY STOPPED HIM BY THIS NOVEL ARTILLERY
ITS INTERIOR WAS THE SCENE OF MOST OF JUDE'S EDUCATION BY PRIVATE STUDY AS SOON AS THE HORSE HAD LEARNT THE ROAD AND THE HOUSES AT WHICH HE WAS TO PAUSE AWHILE THE BOY SEATED IN FRONT WOULD SLIP THE REINS OVER HIS ARM INGENIOUSLY FIX OPEN
AS BY THE LIGHT OF A FALLING LAMP ONE MIGHT MOMENTARILY SEE AN INSCRIPTION ON A WALL BEFORE BEING ENSHROUDED IN DARKNESS AND THEN THIS PASSING DISCRIMINATIVE POWER WAS WITHDRAWN
HE STOPPED THE HORSE ALIGHTED AND GLANCING ROUND TO SEE THAT NOBODY WAS IN SIGHT KNELT DOWN ON THE ROADSIDE BANK WITH OPEN BOOK HE TURNED FIRST TO THE SHINY GODDESS WHO SEEMED TO LOOK SO SOFTLY AND CRITICALLY AT HIS DOINGS
CERTAINLY THERE SEEMED LITTLE HARMONY BETWEEN THIS PAGAN LITERATURE AND THE MEDIAEVAL COLLEGES AT CHRISTMINSTER THAT ECCLESIASTICAL ROMANCE IN STONE
TILL MOVED BY AMATORY CURIOSITY SHE TURNED HER EYES CRITICALLY UPON HIM YOU DON'T THINK I WOULD SHY THINGS AT YOU OH NO
WHAT DID YOU STAY TALKING TO HIM FOR IF YOU DIDN'T WANT UN WHETHER YOU DO OR WHETHER YOU DON'T HE'S AS SIMPLE AS A CHILD
PUTREFACTION AND TAR EVERY NEWCOMER FELT SAD AND DEJECTED IN IT THE WOMAN WARDER FELT THIS THOUGH SHE WAS USED TO BAD AIR SHE HAD JUST COME IN FROM OUTSIDE
EVERYTHING SEEMED REPUGNANT TO HER
THE ADVOCATE IS A GENIUS HE SAID THE LISTENERS HEARD IT ALL WITH RESPECTFUL ATTENTION AND SEVERAL OF THEM TRIED TO PUT IN A WORD BUT THE MAN INTERRUPTED THEM AS IF HE ALONE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
STILL SPRING WAS SPRING EVEN IN THE TOWN THE SUN SHONE WARM THE AIR WAS BALMY
AND WAS ABOUT TO GO AWAY BUT SEEING THE BABY HER HEART WAS TOUCHED
AND HE TAKING IT AS HIS DUE AS HE ALWAYS DID WHEN AMONG STRANGERS HAD HE BEEN ASKED WHY HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ABOVE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HE COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN AN ANSWER
A LIFE WHICH IS LED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN AND WHICH IS NOT MERELY TOLERATED BUT SANCTIONED BY THE GOVERNMENT ANXIOUS FOR THE WELFARE OF ITS SUBJECTS
WHO HAD STOOD GODMOTHER TO THE GIRL HAD THE KINDER HEART OF THE TWO SISTERS
MISSY WHEN NEKHLUDOFF HAD FINISHED HIS COFFEE HE WENT TO HIS STUDY TO LOOK AT THE SUMMONS AND FIND OUT WHAT TIME HE WAS TO APPEAR AT THE COURT BEFORE WRITING HIS ANSWER TO THE PRINCESS PASSING THROUGH HIS STUDIO
AND MASLOVA STEPPED OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CORRIDOR
AND FARM ALL THE LAND NOW RENTED BY THE PEASANTS THEMSELVES THE STEWARD WROTE THAT THIS WOULD BE A FAR MORE PROFITABLE WAY OF MANAGING THE PROPERTY
WHICH WAS COVERED WITH A FINE STARCHED CLOTH STOOD A SILVER COFFEEPOT FULL OF AROMATIC COFFEE A SUGAR BASIN A JUG OF FRESH CREAM AND A BREAD BASKET FILLED WITH FRESH ROLLS RUSKS AND BISCUITS
THANKING HER FOR THE INVITATION AND PROMISING TO TRY AND COME TO DINNER HAVING WRITTEN ONE NOTE HE TORE IT UP AS IT SEEMED TOO INTIMATE HE WROTE ANOTHER BUT IT WAS TOO COLD HE FEARED IT MIGHT GIVE OFFENCE SO HE TORE IT UP TOO
THEY DESCENDED THE STONE STAIRS
HE GAVE HER ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES AND OFFERED HER A SEPARATE LODGING NEXT DOOR TO THE LODGING RENTED FOR HER BY THE AUTHOR THERE LIVED A JOLLY YOUNG SHOPMAN WITH WHOM KATUSHA SOON FELL IN LOVE SHE TOLD THE AUTHOR
AND WAS HURT IF HE DID NOT GET IT IN THE JURYMEN'S ROOM HIS FEELINGS WERE HURT BY DISRESPECTFUL TREATMENT AMONG THE JURY THERE HAPPENED TO BE A MAN WHOM HE KNEW A FORMER TEACHER OF HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN PETER GERASIMOVITCH
THE UNPRINCIPLED WIFE OF THE MARECHAL DE NOBLESSE OF A DISTRICT WHERE NEKHLUDOFF WAS PRESENT AT AN ELECTION THE DESIRE OF VANQUISHING HIM THIS WOMAN DREW HIM INTO AN INTIMACY WHICH ENTANGLED HIM MORE AND MORE
HE LOOKED AT THE LUXURIOUS FITTINGS OF THE STUDIO WITH A HEAVY HEART AND IT WAS IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD THAT HE ENTERED HIS STUDY A LARGE LOFTY ROOM FITTED UP WITH A VIEW TO COMFORT CONVENIENCE AND ELEGANT APPEARANCE
WAS TO NEKHLUDOFF A PROOF OF HER GOOD SENSE AND CORRECT JUDGMENT AGAINST MARRYING MISSY IN PARTICULAR WAS THAT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GIRL WITH EVEN HIGHER QUALITIES COULD BE FOUND THAT SHE WAS ALREADY TWENTY SEVEN
WHILE IT DAILY BECAME MORE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM HAVING SUCCUMBED TO THE TEMPTATION NEKHLUDOFF FELT GUILTY AND HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO BREAK THE TIE WITHOUT HER CONSENT
ALSO THE TERRIBLE SCENE HE HAD WITH HER WHEN SHE RAN OUT INTO THE PARK AND IN HER EXCITEMENT TRIED TO DROWN HERSELF IN THE POND
WAS OF THE BEST QUALITY VERY QUIET SIMPLE DURABLE AND COSTLY NEKHLUDOFF DRESSED LEISURELY AND WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM
THE WOMAN RECEIVED HER VERY KINDLY SET CAKE AND SWEET WINE BEFORE HER THEN WROTE A NOTE AND GAVE IT TO A SERVANT TO TAKE TO SOMEBODY IN THE EVENING A TALL MAN WITH LONG GREY HAIR AND A WHITE BEARD
THIS LETTER WAS PARTLY DISAGREEABLE AND PARTLY PLEASANT IT WAS PLEASANT TO FEEL THAT HE HAD POWER OVER SO LARGE A PROPERTY AND YET DISAGREEABLE
PRINCE DMITRI IVANOVITCH NEKHLUDOFF WHO HAD SEDUCED HER WAS STILL LYING ON HIS HIGH BEDSTEAD WITH A FEATHER BED ON THE TOP OF THE SPRING MATTRESS IN A FINE CLEAN WELL IRONED LINEN NIGHT SHIRT
PUT THE PAPER INTO THE SLEEVE OF HIS COAT WINKED
ALL WERE GLAD THE PLANTS THE BIRDS THE INSECTS AND THE CHILDREN BUT MEN GROWN UP MEN AND WOMEN DID NOT LEAVE OFF CHEATING AND TORMENTING THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER
THEIR FACES ALL HAD A CERTAIN LOOK OF SATISFACTION AT THE PROSPECT OF FULFILLING A PUBLIC DUTY ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM HAD HAD TO LEAVE THEIR BUSINESSES AND MOST WERE COMPLAINING OF IT THE JURYMEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES ABOUT THE WEATHER
THE OLD MAIDEN LADY SCOLDED THE MAIDS AGAIN
THEREFORE EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD HIM THIS UNDERSTANDING OF HIM
A PEASANT WHO HAD SOLD HIS CHARCOAL AND HAD HAD SOME TEA IN THE TOWN CAME UP AND AFTER CROSSING HIMSELF GAVE HER A COPECK THE PRISONER BLUSHED AND MUTTERED SOMETHING
BEGAN BEATING HER KATUSHA DEFENDED HERSELF AND THEY HAD A FIGHT
THE LITTLE BLACK EYED MAIDEN GREW TO BE EXTREMELY PRETTY AND SO FULL OF SPIRITS THAT THE LADIES FOUND HER VERY ENTERTAINING THE YOUNGER OF THE LADIES SOPHIA IVANOVNA
TO HARMONY AND TO LOVE BUT ONLY THEIR OWN DEVICES FOR ENSLAVING ONE ANOTHER THUS IN THE PRISON OFFICE OF THE GOVERNMENT TOWN
THE EARLY SPRING AND THE BUSINESS BEFORE THEM SOME HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED OTHERS JUST GUESSING WHO WAS WHO THOSE WHO WERE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH NEKHLUDOFF MADE HASTE TO GET INTRODUCED EVIDENTLY LOOKING UPON THIS AS AN HONOUR
YES SIR IT IS NOT VERY POLITE BUT I CAN'T WRITE NO MATTER I SHALL SEE HER TODAY THOUGHT NEKHLUDOFF AND WENT TO GET HIS OVERCOAT WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AN ISVOSTCHIK HE KNEW
SMOKING A CIGARETTE AND CONSIDERING WHAT HE HAD TO DO TO DAY AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED YESTERDAY RECALLING THE EVENING HE HAD SPENT WITH THE KORCHAGINS
ENTERED THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN AT ONCE NEAR KATUSHA SMILING AND GAZING AT HER WITH GLISTENING EYES HE BEGAN JOKING WITH HER THE HOSTESS CALLED HIM AWAY INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND KATUSHA HEARD HER SAY A FRESH ONE FROM THE COUNTRY
THAT HE HAD A LIAISON WITH A MARRIED WOMAN AND THOUGH HE CONSIDERED IT BROKEN OFF SHE DID NOT NEKHLUDOFF WAS RATHER SHY WITH WOMEN AND HIS VERY SHYNESS AWAKENED IN THIS MARRIED WOMAN
THAT JUSTICE FORBIDS PRIVATE LANDHOLDING AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD RESOLUTENESS OF HIS AGE HAD NOT MERELY SPOKEN TO PROVE THAT LAND COULD NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND WRITTEN ESSAYS ON THAT SUBJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY
WHERE A FEW STUDIES HUNG ON THE WALLS AND FACING THE EASEL STOOD AN UNFINISHED PICTURE A FEELING OF INABILITY TO ADVANCE IN ART A SENSE OF HIS INCAPACITY CAME OVER HIM HE HAD OFTEN HAD THIS FEELING OF LATE
ANY MORE THAN MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN HIS MIND AT THIS TIME IT WAS IN FAVOUR OF MARRIAGE IN GENERAL THAT BESIDES THE COMFORTS OF HEARTH AND HOME IT MADE A MORAL LIFE POSSIBLE AND CHIEFLY THAT A FAMILY WOULD
NEKHLUDOFF NEVER KNEW HIS SURNAME AND EVEN BRAGGED A BIT ABOUT THIS THIS MAN WAS NOW A MASTER AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL NEKHLUDOFF COULD NOT STAND HIS FAMILIARITY HIS SELF SATISFIED LAUGHTER
YES MY DEAR SIR THIS IS IT ONE OF US ON THE JURY ARE YOU ASKED THE MERCHANT WITH A MERRY WINK
AND SHE REMAINED WITH THE SON AS HIS HOUSEKEEPER AGRAPHENA PETROVNA HAD SPENT NEARLY TEN YEARS AT DIFFERENT TIMES ABROAD WITH NEKHLUDOFF'S MOTHER AND HAD THE APPEARANCE AND MANNERS OF A LADY
APPEARED IN STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE DULL PALLOR OF HER FACE SHE CARRIED HERSELF VERY STRAIGHT EXPANDING HER FULL BOSOM WITH HER HEAD SLIGHTLY THROWN BACK
NEKHLUDOFF FLUSHED AND FELT HIS ENERGIES AWAKENING AS THEY ALWAYS DID WHEN HE WAS FACING ANY KIND OF DANGER BUT HIS EXCITEMENT PASSED AT ONCE THE MARECHAL DO NOBLESSE OF THE DISTRICT IN WHICH HIS LARGEST ESTATE LAY
CALLED OUT MASLOVA TO THE COURT AND CLOSED THE DOOR AGAIN EVEN INTO THE PRISON YARD THE BREEZE HAD BROUGHT THE FRESH VIVIFYING AIR FROM THE FIELDS
THEN FROM A TAP FIXED TO HIS MARBLE WASHSTAND HE LET A SPRAY OF COLD WATER RUN OVER HIS FACE AND STOUT NECK HAVING FINISHED THIS PART OF THE BUSINESS HE WENT INTO A THIRD ROOM WHERE A SHOWER BATH STOOD READY FOR HIM
WAS NEGLECTED BY ITS MOTHER WHOM IT HINDERED AT HER WORK
I NEVER MEANT TO GET OUT OF IT REPLIED NEKHLUDOFF GLOOMILY AND IN A TONE OF SEVERITY WELL I CALL THIS BEING PUBLIC SPIRITED BUT JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU GET HUNGRY OR SLEEPY YOU'LL SING TO ANOTHER TUNE THEN
THE MARECHAL'S WIFE AND FINISH COMPLETELY WITH HER I CAN DO NOTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND THE CONVICTION THAT HE MIGHT AND WAS EVEN OBLIGED TO DELAY HIS DECISION WAS COMFORTING WELL
A TABLE WHICH LOOKED VERY IMPOSING WITH ITS FOUR LEGS CARVED IN THE SHAPE OF LIONS PAWS AND A HUGE SIDE BOARD TO MATCH STOOD IN THE OBLONG ROOM THE FLOOR OF WHICH HAD BEEN POLISHED BY THREE MEN THE DAY BEFORE ON THE TABLE
AND HAD LOOKED DOWN WITH SOME DISDAIN AT ALL OTHER ACTIVITY FROM THE HEIGHT OF HIS ARTISTIC STANDPOINT AND NOW IT TURNED OUT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT REMINDED HIM OF ALL THIS WAS UNPLEASANT
THE TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES SOON WENT SOME SHE PAID TO HER AUNT FOR BOARD AND LODGING THE REST WAS SPENT ON A HAT RIBBONS AND SUCH LIKE A FEW DAYS LATER THE AUTHOR SENT FOR HER AND SHE WENT
HE FOUND THE SUMMONS AT ONCE IN A PIGEON HOLE LABELLED IMMEDIATE OF HIS LARGE WRITING TABLE HE HAD TO APPEAR AT THE COURT AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK NEKHLUDOFF SAT DOWN TO WRITE A NOTE IN REPLY TO THE PRINCESS
WHICH THERE IS THE CIVIL COURT AND THE CRIMINAL COURT I AM ON THE JURY THE CRIMINAL COURT YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID HERE TO THE RIGHT THEN TO THE LEFT THE SECOND DOOR NEKHLUDOFF FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION
AND SPENT ALL HE COULD LAY HANDS ON AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE
AND BEGAN SPEAKING TO MASLOVA BUT THE JAILER CLOSED THE DOOR PUSHING THE OLD WOMAN'S HEAD WITH IT A WOMAN'S LAUGHTER WAS HEARD FROM THE CELL AND MASLOVA SMILED
REEKING OF TOBACCO AND POINTING TO THE PRISONER REMARKED TAKE HER THE SOLDIER
I SHALL CONSIDER ALL THAT LATER ON HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS THE TRAP DROVE SILENTLY ALONG THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT UP TO THE DOORS OF THE COURT NOW I MUST FULFIL MY PUBLIC DUTIES CONSCIENTIOUSLY AS I AM IN THE HABIT OF ALWAYS DOING
AND TOLD HER THAT THE MAN WAS AN AUTHOR AND THAT HE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND THAT IF HE LIKED HER HE WOULD NOT GRUDGE HER ANYTHING HE DID LIKE HER AND GAVE HER TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES PROMISING TO SEE HER OFTEN
SHE WORE LINEN STOCKINGS AND PRISON SHOES AND ROUND HER HEAD WAS TIED A WHITE KERCHIEF FROM UNDER WHICH A FEW LOCKS OF BLACK HAIR WERE BRUSHED OVER THE FOREHEAD
WERE NEARLY ALWAYS SORRY FOR IT AFTERWARDS PRESENTLY SHE SPIED CHEE CHEE SWINGING THROUGH THE TREES STILL LOOKING FOR THE DOCTOR WHEN CHEE CHEE SAW HER HE CAME INTO HER TREE
DO NOT SPEAK A WORD OF THIS TO ANY ONE AND WHEN I HAVE DONE AS YOU ASK YOU MUST LET ME AND ALL MY ANIMALS OUT OF PRISON PROMISE BY THE CROWN OF JOLLIGINKI
THE TWELFTH CHAPTER
SO I COME TO YOU FOR HELP IF YOU WILL TURN ME WHITE SO THAT I MAY GO BACK TO THE SLEEPING BEAUTY I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM AND ANYTHING BESIDES YOU ASK PRINCE BUMPO
YOU ASK HIM THEN JIP STILL FAST ASLEEP BEGAN TO GROWL AGAIN AND HIS LIP CURLED UP ANGRILY SHOWING HIS CLEAN WHITE TEETH I SMELL BAD MEN
THE LAND WHERE THEY WERE BORN AND WHEN THE DOCTOR STOOD UPON THE BOAT HE LOOKED OVER THE SIDE ACROSS THE WATER AND THEN HE REMEMBERED
THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF GETTING OUT THEN GUB GUB BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN ALL THIS TIME POLYNESIA WAS STILL SITTING IN THE TREE IN THE PALACE GARDEN
HE CLIMBED HIGH TREES AND LOOKED OUT FROM THE TOP BRANCHES TO TRY AND SEE THE DOCTOR'S HIGH HAT HE WAVED AND SHOUTED HE CALLED TO ALL THE ANIMALS BY NAME BUT IT WAS NO USE
IN A SWIFT SHIP AND WHAT SHOULD HE DO ABOUT IT WHEN THE SWALLOWS HEARD THIS THEY ALL CAME DOWN ON TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP AND THEY TOLD HIM TO UNRAVEL SOME PIECES OF LONG ROPE
YOU CAN COUNT ITS THREE BIG SAILS ALL RED WHOEVER IT IS THEY ARE COMING AFTER US I WONDER WHO THEY ARE THEY ARE BAD SAILORS SAID JIP AND THEIR SHIP IS VERY SWIFT
HE MUST BEGIN SCRUBBING THE KITCHEN FLOOR THEY WERE ALL VERY UNHAPPY THIS IS A GREAT NUISANCE SAID THE DOCTOR
THEY ALL LOOKED UP AND THERE STREAMING ACROSS THE FACE OF THE MOON
THE WIDE WIDE SEA LOOKED TERRIBLY BIG AND LONESOME IN THE MOONLIGHT AND HE BEGAN TO WONDER IF THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR WAY WHEN THEY PASSED OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
AND FLEW OFF PULLING THE BOAT ALONG AND ALTHOUGH SWALLOWS ARE NOT VERY STRONG WHEN ONLY ONE OR TWO ARE BY THEMSELVES IT IS DIFFERENT WHEN THERE ARE A GREAT LOT OF THEM TOGETHER
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT SAID POLYNESIA IMPATIENTLY BUT YOU MUST
WOOF OO WOOF THEN HE BARKED LOUD AND WOKE HIMSELF UP WITH A SURPRISED LOOK ON HIS FACE SEE CRIED DAB DAB THAT BOAT IS NEARER NOW
ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE TREES THE DOCTOR COULD SEE THAT THEY HAD BLUE WINGS AND WHITE BREASTS AND VERY SHORT FEATHERED LEGS
AND BEGAN READING THE FAIRY STORIES TO HIMSELF CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA WATCHED HIM KEEPING VERY QUIET AND STILL
I MUST BE A WHITE PRINCE YOU KNOW IT IS VERY HARD TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF A PRINCE SAID THE DOCTOR ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS A MAGICIAN CAN DO
THOSE WHO STAYED BEHIND CHEE CHEE POLYNESIA AND THE CROCODILE GREW TERRIBLY SAD FOR NEVER IN THEIR LIVES HAD THEY KNOWN ANY ONE THEY LIKED SO WELL AS DOCTOR JOHN DOLITTLE
BUT WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE SO I CAME BACK FULL OF SADNESS TO MY FATHER'S KINGDOM
AND IN A MOMENT THE DOCTOR FOUND HIMSELF TRAVELING SO FAST HE HAD TO HOLD HIS HAT ON WITH BOTH HANDS FOR HE FELT AS THOUGH THE SHIP ITSELF
LOST THE MEDICINE BAG IN THE UNDER BRUSH THERE SEEMED NO END TO THEIR TROUBLES AND NOWHERE COULD THEY COME UPON A PATH AT LAST
HE CAME STROLLING DOWN THE GRAVEL WALK HUMMING A SAD SONG TILL HE REACHED A STONE SEAT RIGHT UNDER THE TREE WHERE THE PARROT AND THE MONKEY WERE HIDING THEN HE LAY DOWN ON THE SEAT
THE SLOWEST HE COULD FIND I SHOULD THINK MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO WIN A RACE IN A SOUP TUREEN AS HOPE TO GET AWAY FROM THEM
CATCHING HIM AND BRINGING HIM BACK THAT I TURNED TO THE LEFT INSTEAD OF THE RIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE SWAMP SH LOOK THERE'S PRINCE BUMPO COMING INTO THE GARDEN HE MUST NOT SEE US
THERE LIES A FAMOUS WIZARD JOHN DOLITTLE BY NAME MANY THINGS HE KNOWS OF MEDICINE AND MAGIC AND MIGHTY DEEDS HAS HE PERFORMED
IT MEANT THAT SOMEBODY HAD BEEN MAKING TROUBLE AND SHE WAS THINKING OUT SOME WAY TO PUT THINGS RIGHT PEOPLE WHO MADE TROUBLE FOR POLYNESIA OR HER FRIENDS
WAS SO THICK WITH BUSHES AND CREEPERS AND VINES THAT SOMETIMES THEY COULD HARDLY MOVE AT ALL AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO TAKE OUT HIS POCKET KNIFE AND CUT HIS WAY ALONG
THE KING'S SON LAID THE BOOK DOWN AND SIGHED A WEARY SIGH IF I WERE ONLY A WHITE PRINCE SAID HE WITH A DREAMY FAR AWAY LOOK IN HIS EYES THEN THE PARROT
NO SOUND BUT THIS GREAT RUSTLING OF FEATHERS WHICH GREW GREATER NOW THAN EVER WHEN THEY BEGAN TO SETTLE ON THE SANDS ALONG THE ROPES OF THE SHIP
CAN'T BLAME HER FOR GETTING SCARED I WONDER WHO HE'LL GO AND KISS THIS TIME SILLY BUSINESS THEN THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE WHITE MOUSE GUB GUB DAB DAB
USED TO WAIT FOR SAILORS TO BE SHIPWRECKED ON THEIR SHORES AND OFTEN IF THEY SAW A BOAT PASSING THEY WOULD COME OUT IN THEIR FAST SAILING SHIPS AND CHASE IT WHEN THEY CAUGHT A BOAT
BUT IT ISN'T SO EASY TO TURN A BLACK MAN WHITE YOU SPEAK AS THOUGH HE WERE A DRESS TO BE RE DYED IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE SHALL THE LEOPARD CHANGE HIS SPOTS OR THE ETHIOPIAN HIS SKIN
SAID THE DOCTOR IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO GET ANOTHER BOAT TO GO HOME IN OH WELL PERHAPS WE'LL FIND ONE LYING ABOUT ON THE BEACH THAT NOBODY IS USING NEVER LIFT YOUR FOOT
HE NEEDED IT TO SHAVE WITH THEN THE PRINCE TAKING A BUNCH OF COPPER KEYS FROM HIS POCKET UNDID THE GREAT DOUBLE LOCKS AND THE DOCTOR WITH ALL HIS ANIMALS
BUT EVEN WHILE HE WAS WONDERING THEY HEARD A STRANGE WHISPERING NOISE HIGH IN THE AIR COMING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE ANIMALS ALL STOPPED SAYING GOOD BY AND LISTENED
LOOKING AT ALL THE BOTTLES HE HAD USED FOR THE MIXTURE AND READING THE LABELS ON THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN A STRONG SMELL FILLED THE PRISON LIKE THE SMELL OF BROWN PAPER BURNING AT LAST
I SUPPOSE IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE SAID THE DOCTOR LET ME SEE AND HE WENT OVER TO HIS MEDICINE BAG MURMURING SOMETHING ABOUT LIBERATED CHLORINE ON ANIMAL PIGMENT
I WENT IN SEARCH OF THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WHOM I HAD READ OF IN A BOOK AND HAVING TRAVELED THROUGH THE WORLD MANY DAYS I AT LAST FOUND HER
THEN THEY USED TO MAKE THE PEOPLE THEY HAD CAUGHT WRITE HOME TO THEIR FRIENDS FOR MONEY AND IF THE FRIENDS SENT NO MONEY THE PIRATES OFTEN THREW THE PEOPLE INTO THE SEA
RAN AS FAST AS THEY COULD DOWN TO THE SEASHORE WHILE BUMPO LEANED AGAINST THE WALL OF THE EMPTY DUNGEON SMILING AFTER THEM HAPPILY HIS BIG FACE SHINING LIKE POLISHED IVORY IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES THAT SPEAK TO THEE I AM HIDING IN A ROSE BUD OH TELL ME FAIRY QUEEN CRIED BUMPO CLASPING HIS HANDS IN JOY
NOW ONE SUNSHINY DAY THE DOCTOR AND DAB DAB WERE WALKING UP AND DOWN ON THE SHIP FOR EXERCISE A NICE FRESH WIND WAS BLOWING THE BOAT ALONG AND EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE BEACH THEY SAW POLYNESIA AND CHEE CHEE WAITING FOR THEM ON THE ROCKS NEAR THE SHIP I FEEL SORRY ABOUT BUMPO SAID THE DOCTOR
AND PRESENTLY ALL THESE BIRDS CAME DOWN CLOSE SKIMMING OVER THE WATER AND THE LAND AND THE NIGHT SKY WAS LEFT CLEAR ABOVE AND THE MOON SHONE AS BEFORE
HE GROWLED THE WORST MEN I EVER SMELT I SMELL TROUBLE I SMELL A FIGHT SIX BAD SCOUNDRELS FIGHTING AGAINST ONE BRAVE MAN I WANT TO HELP HIM
AND THERE TIED TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP WERE A THOUSAND STRINGS AND TWO THOUSAND SWALLOWS WERE PULLING ON EACH STRING ALL TERRIBLY SWIFT FLIERS
SAID THE DOCTOR QUICKLY WELL I WILL DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU YOU WILL HAVE TO BE VERY PATIENT THOUGH YOU KNOW WITH SOME MEDICINES YOU CAN NEVER BE VERY SURE I MIGHT HAVE TO TRY TWO OR THREE TIMES
YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF MEDICINES LEFT IN THE BAG HE'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU IF YOU CHANGE HIS COLOR IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO GET OUT OF PRISON WELL
BUMPO BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT KEEP THE LOOKING GLASS AS IT WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI AND HE WANTED TO LOOK AT HIMSELF ALL DAY LONG BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
TO TELL THE TRUTH I WAS SURPRISED MYSELF THAT IT WORKED SO WELL BUT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING DIDN'T I I COULDN'T POSSIBLY SCRUB THE KING'S KITCHEN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IT WAS SUCH A DIRTY KITCHEN
THE BOAT DID NOT GO NEARLY AS FAST AS THE PIRATES' WHICH KEPT COMING ON BEHIND CLOSER AND CLOSER THIS IS A POOR SHIP THE PRINCE GAVE US SAID GUB GUB THE PIG
FAREWELL FAREWELL CRIED THE PRINCE A THOUSAND THANKS GOOD TRIPSITINKA AND HE SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT AGAIN WITH A SMILE UPON HIS FACE
AND WHO KNOWS HE MAY STAY WHITE AFTER ALL THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WOULD NEVER HAVE HIM EVEN IF HE DID SAID DAB DAB HE LOOKED BETTER THE WAY HE WAS I THOUGHT BUT HE'D NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT UGLY
SIR WILLIAM ASHTON IS A MASK FOR A VULGAR TEMPTATION
EVERY THOUGHT EVERY EMOTION WHICH BELONGS TO IT IN APPROPRIATE EVENTS BUT THE THOUGHT IS ALWAYS PRIOR TO THE FACT
WE HAVE AS IT WERE BEEN THE MAN THAT MADE THE MINSTER WE HAVE SEEN HOW IT COULD AND MUST BE WE HAVE THE SUFFICIENT REASON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN IS IN THEIR PRINCIPLE OF ASSOCIATION
ONE MAY SAY A GRAVITATING SOLAR SYSTEM
AND YIELD ITS OWN VIRTUE TO HIM HE SHOULD SEE THAT HE CAN LIVE ALL HISTORY IN HIS OWN PERSON HE MUST SIT SOLIDLY AT HOME AND NOT SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE BULLIED BY KINGS OR EMPIRES
BY SURROUNDING OURSELVES WITH THE ORIGINAL CIRCUMSTANCES WE INVENT ANEW THE ORDERS AND THE ORNAMENTS OF ARCHITECTURE
HE IS THE COMPEND OF TIME HE IS ALSO THE CORRELATIVE OF NATURE
AND FAR BACK IN THE WOMB OF THINGS SEES THE RAYS PARTING FROM ONE ORB
SERVE THEM FACTS ENCUMBER THEM TYRANNIZE OVER THEM AND MAKE THE MEN OF ROUTINE THE MEN OF SENSE IN WHOM A LITERAL OBEDIENCE TO FACTS HAS EXTINGUISHED EVERY SPARK OF THAT LIGHT BY WHICH MAN IS TRULY MAN
DOWN TO THE DOMESTIC LIFE OF THE ATHENIANS AND SPARTANS FOUR OR FIVE CENTURIES LATER WHAT BUT THIS
I FIND TRUE IN CONCORD
ALONG THE SIDES OF THE STONE WALL WHICH OBVIOUSLY GAVE THE IDEA OF THE COMMON ARCHITECTURAL SCROLL
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT COMMON SOULS PAY WITH WHAT THEY DO NOBLER SOULS WITH THAT WHICH THEY ARE AND WHY BECAUSE A PROFOUND NATURE AWAKENS IN US BY ITS ACTIONS AND WORDS BY ITS VERY LOOKS AND MANNERS
STILL INDICATE THE GREEN WITHES THAT TIED THEM NO ONE CAN WALK IN A ROAD
THE VALUE WHICH IS GIVEN TO WOOD BY CARVING LED TO THE CARVING OVER THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN OF STONE OF A CATHEDRAL WHEN WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS
SACRED CITIES TO WHICH A PERIODICAL RELIGIOUS PILGRIMAGE WAS ENJOINED OR STRINGENT LAWS AND CUSTOMS TENDING TO INVIGORATE THE NATIONAL BOND
PROPERTY ALSO HOLDS OF THE SOUL COVERS GREAT SPIRITUAL FACTS AND INSTINCTIVELY WE AT FIRST HOLD TO IT WITH SWORDS AND LAWS AND WIDE AND COMPLEX COMBINATIONS
MORE THAN ONCE SOME INDIVIDUAL HAS APPEARED TO ME WITH SUCH NEGLIGENCE OF LABOR AND SUCH COMMANDING CONTEMPLATION A HAUGHTY BENEFICIARY BEGGING IN THE NAME OF GOD AS MADE GOOD TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SIMEON THE STYLITE
SOFT AND FLUID AS A CLOUD OR THE AIR WHY SHOULD WE BE SUCH HARD PEDANTS AND MAGNIFY A FEW FORMS WHY SHOULD WE MAKE ACCOUNT OF TIME OR OF MAGNITUDE OR OF FIGURE THE SOUL KNOWS THEM NOT
THROUGH THE GRUB THROUGH THE EGG THE CONSTANT INDIVIDUAL THROUGH COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS THE FIXED SPECIES THROUGH MANY SPECIES THE GENUS THROUGH ALL GENERA THE STEADFAST TYPE
WHILST NOW WE PRAY WITH THE UTMOST COLDNESS AND VERY SELDOM
SEE IN GOETHE'S HELENA THE SAME DESIRE THAT EVERY WORD SHOULD BE A THING THESE FIGURES HE WOULD SAY
NOT OF HIMSELF BUT MORE SWEET OF THAT CHARACTER HE SEEKS IN EVERY WORD THAT IS SAID CONCERNING CHARACTER YEA FURTHER IN EVERY FACT AND CIRCUMSTANCE
AND VERIFIES THEM WITH HIS OWN HEAD AND HANDS THE BEAUTIFUL FABLES OF THE GREEKS BEING PROPER CREATIONS OF THE IMAGINATION AND NOT OF THE FANCY ARE UNIVERSAL VERITIES WHAT A RANGE OF MEANINGS AND WHAT PERPETUAL PERTINENCE HAS THE STORY OF PROMETHEUS
COLUMBUS NEEDS A PLANET TO SHAPE HIS COURSE UPON
I WILL NOT MAKE MORE ACCOUNT OF THEM I BELIEVE IN ETERNITY I CAN FIND GREECE ASIA ITALY SPAIN AND THE ISLANDS
INSTEAD OF THIS OLD CHRONOLOGY OF SELFISHNESS AND PRIDE TO WHICH WE HAVE TOO LONG LENT OUR EYES
THESE PROPENSITIES STILL FIGHT OUT THE OLD BATTLE IN THE NATION AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL THE NOMADS OF AFRICA WERE CONSTRAINED TO WANDER BY THE ATTACKS OF THE GAD FLY
WILL YET SUPERINDUCE THE SAME SENTIMENT
ONLY A BUNYAN DISGUISE FOR HONEST INDUSTRY WE MAY ALL SHOOT A WILD BULL THAT WOULD TOSS THE GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL BY FIGHTING DOWN THE UNJUST AND SENSUAL LUCY ASHTON IS ANOTHER NAME FOR FIDELITY
THERE IS NO AGE OR STATE OF SOCIETY OR MODE OF ACTION IN HISTORY TO WHICH THERE IS NOT SOMEWHAT CORRESPONDING IN HIS LIFE EVERY THING TENDS IN A WONDERFUL MANNER TO ABBREVIATE ITSELF
AS BY PERSONAL ALLUSIONS A TRUE ASPIRANT THEREFORE NEVER NEEDS LOOK FOR ALLUSIONS PERSONAL AND LAUDATORY IN DISCOURSE HE HEARS THE COMMENDATION
THERE IS A RELATION BETWEEN THE HOURS OF OUR LIFE AND THE CENTURIES OF TIME AS THE AIR I BREATHE IS DRAWN FROM THE GREAT REPOSITORIES OF NATURE
FOR THIS IS THE ONLY AND SOVEREIGN AGENT OF THE WORKS OF THIS MIND HISTORY IS THE RECORD ITS GENIUS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE ENTIRE SERIES OF DAYS
OR DRAW A CHILD BY STUDYING THE OUTLINES OF ITS FORM MERELY
TANTALUS IS BUT A NAME FOR YOU AND ME TANTALUS MEANS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DRINKING THE WATERS OF THOUGHT WHICH ARE ALWAYS GLEAMING AND WAVING WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SOUL THE TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULS IS NO FABLE I WOULD IT WERE BUT MEN AND WOMEN ARE ONLY HALF HUMAN
IS AS MUCH AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE MIND'S POWERS AND DEPRAVATIONS AS WHAT HAS BEFALLEN US EACH NEW LAW AND POLITICAL MOVEMENT HAS MEANING FOR YOU STAND BEFORE EACH OF ITS TABLETS AND SAY
THE GREAT PROSPERITIES OF MEN BECAUSE THERE LAW WAS ENACTED THE SEA WAS SEARCHED THE LAND WAS FOUND OR THE BLOW WAS STRUCK
ANY MORE THAN HE CAN DRAW TO DAY THE FACE OF A PERSON WHOM HE SHALL SEE TO MORROW FOR THE FIRST TIME I WILL NOT NOW GO BEHIND THE GENERAL STATEMENT TO EXPLORE THE REASON OF THIS CORRESPONDENCY LET IT SUFFICE THAT IN THE LIGHT OF THESE TWO FACTS NAMELY
AND ALTHOUGH THAT POEM BE AS VAGUE AND FANTASTIC AS A DREAM YET IS IT MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN THE MORE REGULAR DRAMATIC PIECES OF THE SAME AUTHOR FOR THE REASON THAT IT OPERATES A WONDERFUL RELIEF TO THE MIND FROM THE ROUTINE OF CUSTOMARY IMAGES
COOK BUTCHER AND SOLDIER AND THE HABIT OF SUPPLYING HIS OWN NEEDS EDUCATES THE BODY TO WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES
EVERY PLANT EVERY ANIMAL IN ITS GROWTH TEACHES THE UNITY OF CAUSE THE VARIETY OF APPEARANCE UPBORNE AND SURROUNDED AS WE ARE BY THIS ALL CREATING NATURE
DOCTOR SAID HIS WIFE TO MARTIN LUTHER ONE DAY
THE GOTHIC CHURCH PLAINLY ORIGINATED IN A RUDE ADAPTATION OF THE FOREST TREES

IT IS THE SPIRIT AND NOT THE FACT THAT IS IDENTICAL BY A DEEPER APPREHENSION
AND AS CRABS GOATS SCORPIONS THE BALANCE AND THE WATERPOT LOSE THEIR MEANNESS WHEN HUNG AS SIGNS IN THE ZODIAC SO I CAN SEE MY OWN VICES WITHOUT HEAT
OUR ADMIRATION OF THE ANTIQUE IS NOT ADMIRATION OF THE OLD BUT OF THE NATURAL
SHALL PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME WITH ALL THE ORNAMENT THAT TITLES OF NOBILITY COULD EVER ADD THE TRIVIAL EXPERIENCE OF EVERY DAY IS ALWAYS VERIFYING SOME OLD PREDICTION TO US AND CONVERTING INTO THINGS THE WORDS AND SIGNS
OR HAS HEARD AN ELOQUENT TONGUE OR HAS SHARED THE THROB OF THOUSANDS IN A NATIONAL EXULTATION OR ALARM NO MAN CAN ANTEDATE HIS EXPERIENCE OR GUESS WHAT FACULTY OR FEELING A NEW OBJECT SHALL UNLOCK
BESIDES THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS INDIVIDUALS WHO RETAIN THESE CHARACTERISTICS A PERSON OF CHILDLIKE GENIUS AND INBORN ENERGY
WHEN HE HAS SATISFIED HIMSELF IN GENERAL AND IN DETAIL THAT IT WAS MADE BY SUCH A PERSON AS HE SO ARMED AND SO MOTIVED
NAMELY A DISCONTENT WITH THE BELIEVED FACT THAT A GOD EXISTS AND A FEELING THAT THE OBLIGATION OF REVERENCE IS ONEROUS
TO SUSA IN SUMMER AND TO BABYLON FOR THE WINTER
SO THAT WHEN ART CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF NATURE IT COULD NOT MOVE ON A SMALL SCALE WITHOUT DEGRADING ITSELF WHAT WOULD STATUES OF THE USUAL SIZE OR NEAT PORCHES AND WINGS HAVE BEEN

THEY COMBINE THE ENERGY OF MANHOOD WITH THE ENGAGING UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF CHILDHOOD THE ATTRACTION OF THESE MANNERS IS THAT THEY BELONG TO MAN AND ARE KNOWN TO EVERY MAN IN VIRTUE OF HIS BEING ONCE A CHILD
HISTORY IS TO BE READ AND WRITTEN THUS IN ALL WAYS DOES THE SOUL CONCENTRATE AND REPRODUCE ITS TREASURES FOR EACH PUPIL HE TOO SHALL PASS THROUGH THE WHOLE CYCLE OF EXPERIENCE HE SHALL COLLECT INTO A FOCUS THE RAYS OF NATURE
HIS THOUGHT LIVES ALONG THE WHOLE LINE OF TEMPLES AND SPHINXES AND CATACOMBS PASSES THROUGH THEM ALL WITH SATISFACTION AND THEY LIVE AGAIN TO THE MIND OR ARE NOW

IT MAY OR IT MAY NOT BE NEAR HERE DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ME THUNDER AGAIN OF COURSE PETER SAID HE DID AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR STRUTTER TO SHOW OFF PETER STAYED A WHILE LONGER
HE DIDN'T SEE ME AT ALL CHUCKLED MISSUS GROUSE AS SHE SETTLED DOWN ONCE MORE THAT IS WHAT COMES OF HAVING A CLOAK SO LIKE THE COLOR OF THESE NICE BROWN LEAVES
HENYARD IN THE MOST STATELY WAY YOU CAN IMAGINE STRUTTER WALKED THE LENGTH OF THAT MOSSY LOG
IT WAS THOSE FAST MOVING WINGS THAT MADE THE THUNDER IT WAS SO LOUD THAT PETER ALMOST WANTED TO STOP HIS EARS WHEN IT ENDED
IT IS ENOUGH TO SCARE ANYBODY BUT I'LL TRY AND LET THEM SEE THAT I BELONG TO A SUPERIOR RACE AND WILL NOT SHOW WHAT I FEEL MY EYES KEPT WANDERING ABOUT EAGERLY FIRST TO LOOK WHERE MY COMPANIONS
THAT MY PURSUERS WERE AS SWIFT OF FOOT AND THAT THOUGH I WAS CLOSE UPON
STRETCHED HIMSELF TO HIS FULL HEIGHT AND HIS WINGS BEGAN TO BEAT FIRST SLOWLY THEN FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL THEY WERE JUST A BLUR THEY SEEMED TO TOUCH ABOVE HIS BACK BUT WHEN THEY CAME DOWN THEY DIDN'T QUITE STRIKE HIS SIDES
AS HE DREW NEARER TO IT IT SOUNDED LOUDER AND LOUDER PRESENTLY PETER STOPPED TO TRY TO LOCATE EXACTLY THE PLACE WHERE THAT SOUND WHICH NOW WAS MORE THAN EVER LIKE THUNDER WAS COMING FROM
IT WAS TRUE CREAKER THE GRACKLE WITH THE SUN SHINING ON HIM WAS TRULY BEAUTIFUL HIS HEAD AND NECK HIS THROAT AND UPPER BREAST WERE A SHINING BLUE BLACK WHILE HIS BACK WAS A RICH SHINING BRASSY GREEN
THIS CHANGING OF COLORS IS CALLED IRIDESCENCE ONE OTHER THING PETER NOTICED AND THIS WAS THAT CREAKER'S EYES WERE YELLOW JUST AT THE MOMENT PETER COULDN'T REMEMBER ANY OTHER BIRD WITH YELLOW EYES
AT MY HEAD IF THAT BLOW HAD TAKEN EFFECT I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL
BUT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME I SAW NOT THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF ESCAPE THERE WERE TOO MANY SAVAGES CLOSE ABOUT ME AND THEY MUST HAVE DIVINED MY IDEAS FOR THEY KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE UPON
STRUTTER NODDED SHE HAS TWELVE EGGS HE ADDED PROUDLY I SUPPOSE SAID PETER ARTFULLY HER NEST IS SOMEWHERE NEAR HERE ON THE GROUND
AND SPREAD IT UNTIL IT WAS LIKE AN OPEN FAN ABOVE HIS BACK THE OUTER EDGE WAS GRAY THEN CAME A BROAD BAND OF BLACK FOLLOWED BY BANDS OF GRAY BROWN AND BLACK
AND PRETTY SWIFTLY THEN THE HARDY LIFE I HAD LED OUT IN THE BUSH WITH JIMMY FOR MY COMPANION HAD MADE ME LIGHT OF FOOT AND TOLERABLY ENDURING
IT WAS A SOUND VERY LIKE DISTANT THUNDER IT BEGAN SLOWLY AT FIRST AND THEN WENT FASTER AND FASTER BOOM BOOM BOOM
OF REDDISH BROWN BLACK AND GRAY FEATHERS HE WAS RESTING SUDDENLY HE STRAIGHTENED UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT
OUT ON THE GREEN MEADOWS JUST BEYOND HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A BLACK FORM WALKING ABOUT IN A STATELY WAY AND NOW AND THEN PICKING UP SOMETHING IT REMINDED HIM OF BLACKY THE
ON HIS WAY HE PASSED A CERTAIN BIG TREE ALL AROUND THE GROUND WAS CARPETED WITH BROWN DEAD LEAVES THERE WERE NO BUSHES OR YOUNG TREES THERE
LAY THE SEA WITH OUR SCHOONER BUT THE OTHER WAS GONE
AND I'M ASHAMED OF MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING CALLED ON HIM THOUGHT PETER AS HE HOPPED OUT AND STARTED ACROSS THE GREEN MEADOWS TOWARDS CREAKER WHAT A SPLENDID LONG TAIL HE HAS I BELIEVE JENNY WREN
HIS REDDISH BROWN WINGS
IN ONE OF THOSE PINE TREES ON THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND I EXPECT ANY DAY NOW WE WILL HAVE FOUR HUNGRY BABIES TO FEED I SHALL HAVE TO GET BUSY THEN YOU KNOW I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT EVERY FATHER
HE ISN'T THE FIRST ONE WHO HAS PASSED ME WITHOUT SEEING ME AT ALL IT IS BETTER THAN TRYING TO HIDE A NEST AND I CERTAINLY AM THANKFUL TO OLD MOTHER NATURE FOR THE CLOAK SHE GAVE ME
ASKED PETER EAGERLY ATTENDING TO HER HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS AS A GOOD HOUSEWIFE SHOULD RETORTED STRUTTER PROMPTLY DO YOU MEAN SHE HAS A NEST AND EGGS ASKED PETER
AND A TALL BLACK ARMED WITH A WAR CLUB CAME DANCING UP TO ME SWINGING HIS WEAPON ABOUT CHATTERING WILDLY AND AFTER A FEW FEINTS HE MADE A BLOW
MAY I ASK YOU A VERY PERSONAL QUESTION CREAKER ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THEM UNLESS I WANT TO RETORTED CREAKER
IF I CAN I HAD NOT MUCH TIME GIVEN ME TO THINK FOR I WAS DRAGGED TO MY FEET AND OUT INTO A LARGE OPEN PLACE WHERE THERE WERE HUTS AND TREES AND THERE BEFORE ME
HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE BLACKY THE CROW THAT I SUPPOSE THIS IS WHY THEY CALL HIM CROW BLACKBIRD
AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO CATCH THE SPEAR ON A SHIELD AND TO AVOID BLOWS MADE WITH WADDIES JIMMY'S LESSONS WERE NOT THROWN AWAY I COULD AVOID A THROWN SPEAR THOUGH HELPLESS
IF I DO SAY IT MYSELF
I SOMETIMES HELP MYSELF TO THE EGGS YOU SEE THE OWNER MIGHT NOT COME BACK AND THEN THOSE EGGS WOULD SPOIL AND THAT WOULD BE A PITY THAT'S NO EXCUSE AT ALL DECLARED PETER I BELIEVE
I KNEW THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN BURNED TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND THEN SUNK I BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FATE OF THE OTHER SCHOONER'S CREW
SHOULD DO HIS FULL SHARE IN TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY IT DECLARED PETER NODDING HIS HEAD WITH APPROVAL
IT WAS THE LAST PLACE IN THE WORLD HE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND ONE WHEN HE WAS WELL PAST THE BIG TREE THERE WAS A SOFT CHUCKLE AND FROM AMONG THE BROWN LEAVES RIGHT AT THE FOOT OF THAT BIG TREE
A HEAD WITH A PAIR OF THE BRIGHTEST EYES WAS RAISED A LITTLE
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN SAMMY JAY AND BLACKY THE CROW CREAKER CHUCKLED BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE AT ALL OFFENDED JUST THEN HE HEARD MISSUS CREAKER CALLING HIM AND WITH A HASTY
I CERTAINLY MUST GO OVER AND PAY HIM A CALL AND FIND OUT WHERE MISSUS GROUSE IS MY HOW STRUTTER CAN DRUM PETER PROMPTLY HEADED TOWARDS THAT DISTANT THUNDER
PETER RATHER TIMIDLY CREAKER SHOOK HIS HEAD NOT QUITE SAID HE SHE LIKES PLAIN BLACK BETTER
BETTER THE LONG ANXIETY I THOUGHT OF WATCHING AND WAITING FOR MY RETURN THAN TO KNOW I HAD BEEN KILLED LIKE THIS BUT I'M NOT KILLED YET I THOUGHT AS THE BLOOD FLUSHED TO MY FACE
SUDDENLY PETER REMEMBERED SOMETHING I KNOW JUST WHERE HE IS SAID HE TO HIMSELF THERE'S A BIG MOSSY HOLLOW LOG OVER YONDER
IF THEY DO I CERTAINLY WILL HAVE A FAMILY TO BE PROUD OF MEANWHILE PETER HURRIED ON IN HIS USUAL HAPPY GO LUCKY FASHION UNTIL HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST
STRIKING THE WRETCH RIGHT IN THE CHEST WITH MY HEAD DRIVING HIM BACKWARD AND LEAPING OVER HIM I RAN FOR MY LIFE
CASTING GLANCES BEHIND ME FROM TIME TO TIME AND SEEING THAT
HIS WINGS AND TAIL WERE MUCH LIKE HIS HEAD AND NECK
AND SOMEHOW IT SEEMED THAT THEY DESERVED IT THEN I BEGAN THINKING OF MY OWN FRIENDS AND THEN VERY SELFISHLY NO DOUBT ABOUT MYSELF BUT I HAD LITTLE TIME FOR THOUGHT
AND BE SEIZED AND KNOCKED ON THE HEAD FOR CERTAIN THE FIERCE RESISTANCE HE WOULD MAKE CERTAINLY WOULD CAUSE HIS DEATH AND I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT
AT LAST HE REACHED A PLACE WHERE HE COULD PEEP OUT AND SEE THAT BIG MOSSY HOLLOW LOG SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS STRUTTER THE RUFFED GROUSE WHEN PETER FIRST SAW HIM HE WAS CROUCHED ON ONE END OF THE LOG
THERE WERE FOUR WHO WERE PRETTY CLOSE UPON MY HEELS ONE OF WHOM HURLED
WERE PLACED BUT AS I SAW NO SIGN OF THEM I BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED SECONDLY TO SEE WHICH WOULD BE THE BEST COURSE TO TAKE IF I RAN FOR MY LIFE FOR I COULD RUN
AND TO MY GREAT JOY I FELT MORE MYSELF AT LAST AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHATTER IT SEEMED THAT A DECISION HAD BEEN COME TO ABOUT ME
BUT I HAD BEEN TOO MUCH WITH MY FRIEND JIMMY NOT TO BE WELL UPON THE ALERT WE HAD OFTEN PLAYED TOGETHER HE LIKE A BIG BOY IN MIMIC FIGHT WHEN HE HAD PRETENDED
HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT IT WASN'T BLACKY BECAUSE IT WAS SO MUCH SMALLER BEING NOT MORE THAN HALF AS BIG IT'S CREAKER THE GRACKLE
THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE ME EASILY AND ONCE CAUGHT I KNEW NOW WHAT WAS TO BE MY FATE I BEGAN THINKING OF THE HUNTED HARE AS I RAN ON
I WAS PANTING HEAVILY AND A CHOKING SENSATION CAME UPON ME BUT I RACED ON SINCE IT WAS FOR LIFE HOW LONG THE PURSUIT LASTED I CANNOT TELL PERHAPS A MINUTE
BIRDS I WOULD CHANGE COATS WITH
CRIED PETER AND HE MEANT JUST WHAT HE SAID STRUTTER THREW OUT HIS CHEST PROUDLY THAT IS JUST WHAT MISSUS GROUSE SAYS HE REPLIED I DON'T KNOW OF ANY BETTER THUNDERER
IN THE SUN AND TO TAKE CARE OF FINE FEATHERS WHERE IS SHE NOW ASKED PETER OVER HOME REPLIED CREAKER PULLING A WHITE GRUB OUT OF THE ROOTS OF THE GRASS WE'VE GOT A NEST OVER THERE
TO GOSSIP BUT FINDING STRUTTER MORE INTERESTED IN THUNDERING THAN IN TALKING HE ONCE MORE STARTED FOR HOME
CREAKER'S YELLOW EYES BEGAN TO TWINKLE THAT IS A VERY PERSONAL QUESTION SAID HE I WON'T GO SO FAR AS TO SAY I STEAL EGGS
I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO REPLIED CREAKER
WHY WHY EE EXCLAIMED PETER RUBBING HIS EYES WITH ASTONISHMENT HE ISN'T JUST BLACK HE'S BEAUTIFUL SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL AND I'VE ALWAYS SUPPOSED HE WAS JUST PLAIN HOMELY BLACK
AND I REMEMBER THAT MISSUS GROUSE ONCE TOLD ME THAT THAT IS STRUTTER'S THUNDER LOG VERY VERY CAREFULLY PETER STOLE FORWARD MAKING NO SOUND AT ALL
EVERY ACT AT FIRST I HAD FELT NUMBED AND COLD MY LEGS AND ARMS ACHED AND WHEN THE BLACKS TOOK OFF THE ROPE THAT THEY HAD BOUND ABOUT MY LIMBS
ONE TIDINGS OF THE COMER
TO SEARCH OUT THE BEST AND LARGEST OF THEM FOR THE COMING HOLIDAY TIME THE LOFT WAS LIGHTED BY A SEMICIRCULAR HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE PIGEONS CREPT TO THEIR LODGINGS IN THE SAME HIGH QUARTERS OF THE PREMISES
STRANGERS DON'T SEE YOU AS I DO SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT THEY JUDGE FROM FALSE REPORT WELL IT IS A SILLY JOB AND I AM PARTLY TO BLAME HOW QUICKLY A RASH THING CAN BE DONE
SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WHAT A CLASS TO BELONG TO DO I REALLY BELONG TO THEM TIS ABSURD YET WHY AUNT DOES EVERYBODY KEEP ON MAKING ME THINK THAT I DO BY THE WAY THEY BEHAVE TOWARDS ME
I THINK HE MAY DO IT NOW THAT HE KNOWS SOMETHING I TOLD HIM I DON'T FOR A MOMENT DISPUTE THAT IT IS THE MOST PROPER THING FOR YOU TO MARRY HIM MUCH AS I HAVE OBJECTED TO HIM IN BYGONE DAYS I AGREE WITH YOU NOW YOU MAY BE SURE
WHY SHOULD SHE NOT GO THAT WAY THE SCENE OF THE DAYDREAM IS SUFFICIENT FOR A PILGRIMAGE AT NINETEEN TO LOOK AT THE PALINGS BEFORE THE YEOBRIGHTS HOUSE HAD THE DIGNITY OF A NECESSARY PERFORMANCE
TO ANY OTHER PERSON THAN A MOTHER IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A LITTLE HUMILIATING THAT SHE THE ELDER OF THE TWO WOMEN SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO MAKE ADVANCES BUT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD WELL CONSIDERED ALL THAT AND SHE ONLY THOUGHT
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CHAP TERRIBLE MUCH AFTER SO MANY YEARS
IS THE VERY THING THAT WILL HINDER THE TALE FROM REACHING HIM EARLY IF I AM NOT MADE SAFE FROM SNEERS IN A WEEK OR TWO I WILL TELL HIM MYSELF THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH THOMASIN SPOKE PREVENTED FURTHER OBJECTIONS
NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN TO SEE THEM TWO MAN AND WIFE THEY'D LOOK VERY NATTY ARM IN CROOK TOGETHER AND THEIR BEST CLOTHES ON WHETHER OR NO
YES SIR THAT'S IT TIS A BLAZING GREAT BUSINESS THAT HE BELONGS TO SO I'VE HEARD HIS MOTHER SAY
IN A PROFOUND REVERIE HER TOE UNCONSCIOUSLY TAPPING THE DRY TURF WHICH LAY BURNING AT HER FEET
WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUDGE ME BY MY ACTS NOW LOOK AT ME AS I KNEEL HERE PICKING UP THESE APPLES DO I LOOK LIKE A LOST WOMAN I WISH ALL GOOD WOMEN WERE AS GOOD AS I SHE
IT WAS NOW NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS LEAVING THE VALES WHEN THE WEST GREW RED THE TWO RELATIVES CAME AGAIN FROM THE HOUSE AND PLUNGED INTO THE HEATH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE FIRST
THOMASIN CAME DOWN WHEN THE APPLES WERE COLLECTED AND TOGETHER THEY WENT THROUGH THE WHITE PALINGS TO THE HEATH BEYOND THE OPEN HILLS WERE AIRY AND CLEAR AND THE REMOTE ATMOSPHERE APPEARED
SHE STOPPED A MOMENT DEAR CLYM I WONDER HOW YOUR FACE LOOKS NOW SHE SAID GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY AT THE PIGEON HOLE
AND EVEN STIFF CABBAGES WERE LIMP BY NOON IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ON THIS DAY THAT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STARTED ACROSS THE HEATH TOWARDS HER SON'S HOUSE TO DO HER BEST IN GETTING RECONCILED WITH HIM AND EUSTACIA
HAD THE NOVELTY OF PAGEANTRY AND WHERE ANY MAN COULD IMAGINE HIMSELF TO BE ADAM WITHOUT THE LEAST DIFFICULTY THEY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF EVERY BIRD WITHIN EYESHOT EVERY REPTILE NOT YET ASLEEP
THE FURZE STACK WAS NOT FAR FROM THE CHIMNEY AND THE VOICES WERE THOSE OF THE WORKERS HER GRANDFATHER JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION
BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF IT HE MUST SOON KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED A MERE LOOK AT YOUR FACE WILL SHOW HIM THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG THOMASIN TURNED AND REGARDED HER AUNT FROM THE TREE
I CAN WELL MIND WHEN HE LEFT HOME SAID SAM TIS A GOOD THING FOR THE FELLER SAID HUMPHREY
HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL THE CENTRE AND VORTEX
THOMASIN WAS PERFORCE CONTENT AND YOU WILL KEEP THE SECRET OF MY WOULD BE MARRIAGE FROM CLYM FOR THE PRESENT SHE NEXT ASKED
SOME IN THE AIR SOME ON THE HOT GROUND AND VEGETATION SOME IN THE TEPID AND STRINGY WATER OF A NEARLY DRIED POOL ALL THE SHALLOWER PONDS HAD DECREASED TO A VAPOROUS MUD
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THESE NEW MOVES IN FAMILIES MY FATHER WAS A SAILOR SO WAS I AND SO SHOULD MY SON HAVE BEEN IF I HAD HAD ONE THE PLACE HE'S BEEN LIVING AT IS PARIS SAID HUMPHREY
THERE BEING LITTLE HERE TO REMIND AN INHABITANT THAT HE MUST UNLEARN HIS SUMMER EXPERIENCE OF THE SKY AS A DIAL IN THE COURSE OF MANY DAYS AND WEEKS
AT WHICH MYRIADS OF IMPRISONED SHAPES AROSE WHERE HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEARED THE STILLNESS OF A VOID
WERE WASPS ROLLING DRUNK WITH THE JUICE OR CREEPING ABOUT THE LITTLE CAVES IN EACH FRUIT WHICH THEY HAD EATEN OUT BEFORE STUPEFIED BY ITS SWEETNESS BY THE DOOR LAY CLYM'S FURZE HOOK
AUNT SHE SAID PRESENTLY I HAVE I THINK A RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YES YOU HAVE
CERTAIN EPHEMERAL OPERATIONS WERE APT TO DISTURB IN THEIR TRIFLING WAY THE MAJESTIC CALM OF EGDON HEATH THEY WERE ACTIVITIES WHICH BESIDE THOSE OF A TOWN A VILLAGE OR EVEN A FARM
CLYM'S FAMILY IS AS GOOD AS HERS
YOU HAVE TIS NEWS TO ME WHILE THE FURZE GATHERERS HAD DESULTORILY CONVERSED THUS EUSTACIA'S FACE GRADUALLY BENT TO THE HEARTH
THE LEAVES OF THE HOLLYHOCKS HUNG LIKE HALF CLOSED UMBRELLAS THE SAP ALMOST SIMMERED IN THE STEMS AND FOLIAGE WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE GLARED LIKE METALLIC MIRRORS
THOMASIN CAME OUT OF THE TREE SHOOK FROM HER HAIR AND DRESS THE LOOSE BERRIES WHICH HAD FALLEN THEREON AND WENT DOWN THE HILL WITH HER AUNT EACH WOMAN BEARING HALF THE GATHERED BOUGHS
ON ANY INFINITESIMAL MATTER WHICH CAUGHT HER EYES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN TO HER SON'S HOUSE AND ITS EXACT POSITION WAS UNKNOWN TO HER
LET HIM BUT SINCE HE LOVED ME ONCE WE WILL NOT PAIN HIM BY TELLING HIM MY TROUBLE TOO SOON THE AIR IS FULL OF THE STORY I KNOW BUT GOSSIPS WILL NOT DARE TO SPEAK OF IT TO HIM FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS HIS CLOSENESS TO ME
EUSTACIA WAS INDOORS IN THE DINING ROOM WHICH WAS REALLY MORE LIKE A KITCHEN HAVING A STONE FLOOR AND A GAPING CHIMNEY CORNER THE AIR WAS STILL AND WHILE SHE LINGERED A MOMENT HERE ALONE
AND SAT DOWN UNDER THEIR SHADE TO RECOVER HERSELF AND TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO BREAK THE GROUND WITH EUSTACIA SO AS NOT TO IRRITATE A WOMAN UNDERNEATH WHOSE APPARENT INDOLENCE LURKED PASSIONS
EVEN THE PURPLE HEATH FLOWERS HAVING PUT ON A BROWNNESS UNDER THE DRY BLAZES OF THE FEW PRECEDING DAYS EVERY VALLEY WAS FILLED WITH AIR LIKE THAT OF A KILN
WHICH MARKED THE VERGE OF THE HEATH IN THIS LATITUDE THEY SHOWED UPON THE DUSKY SCENE THAT THEY BORDERED AS DISTINCTLY AS WHITE LACE ON VELVET BEHIND THE WHITE PALINGS WAS A LITTLE GARDEN BEHIND THE GARDEN
AS A BLACK SPOT IN THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWN OF THE HILL ON REACHING THIS PLACE MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FELT DISTRESSINGLY AGITATED WEARY AND UNWELL SHE ASCENDED
I BELONG TO ONE MAN NOTHING CAN ALTER THAT
SAID THOMASIN WITH ROUND EYES WHAT DO YOU MEAN DON'T BE ALARMED IT WAS MY DUTY
HE USED TO LIKE THEM ALMOST AS WELL AS RIBSTONES THOMASIN TURNED AND ROLLED ASIDE THE FERN FROM ANOTHER NOOK WHERE MORE MELLOW FRUIT GREETED HER WITH ITS RIPE SMELL BEFORE PICKING THEM OUT
HAD UNDERGONE A SPECIES OF INCINERATION SINCE THE DROUGHT HAD SET IN
THAT'S A BAD TROUBLE ABOUT HIS COUSIN THOMASIN
WHERE HE PAUSED AWHILE ON COMING IN HER TURN TO EACH OF THESE SPOTS SHE FOUND HALF A DOZEN LONG LIMP BRAMBLES WHICH HE HAD CUT FROM THE BUSH DURING HIS HALT AND LAID OUT STRAIGHT BESIDE THE PATH
REPLIED THE GIRL HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING AND TEARS SO CROWDED THEMSELVES INTO HER EYES THAT SHE COULD HARDLY DISTINGUISH APPLES FROM FERN AS SHE CONTINUED INDUSTRIOUSLY SEARCHING TO HIDE HER WEAKNESS
A SMALL APPLE TREE OF THE SORT CALLED RATHERIPE GREW JUST INSIDE THE GATE THE ONLY ONE WHICH THROVE IN THE GARDEN BY REASON OF THE LIGHTNESS OF THE SOIL AND AMONG THE FALLEN APPLES ON THE GROUND BENEATH
SHE AND CLYM YEOBRIGHT WOULD MAKE A VERY PRETTY PIGEON PAIR HEY IF THEY WOULDN'T I'LL BE DAZED BOTH OF ONE MIND ABOUT NICETIES FOR CERTAIN AND LEARNED IN PRINT
THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HAPPY MEETING IS THERE ANY USE IN SAYING WHAT CAN DO NO GOOD AUNT YES SAID HER AUNT WITH SOME WARMTH TO THOROUGHLY FILL THE AIR WITH THE PAST MISFORTUNE
AS IT OFTEN APPEARS ON A FINE WINTER DAY IN DISTINCT PLANES OF ILLUMINATION INDEPENDENTLY TONED THE RAYS WHICH LIT THE NEARER TRACTS OF LANDSCAPE
SOUNDS OF VOICES IN CONVERSATION CAME TO HER EARS DIRECTLY DOWN THE CHIMNEY SHE ENTERED THE RECESS AND LISTENING LOOKED UP THE OLD IRREGULAR SHAFT WITH ITS CAVERNOUS HOLLOWS WHERE THE SMOKE BLUNDERED ABOUT
IT WAS A FINE AND QUIET AFTERNOON ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK BUT THE WINTER SOLSTICE HAVING STEALTHILY COME ON THE LOWNESS OF THE SUN CAUSED THE HOUR TO SEEM LATER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS
MADE HIM KNOWN TO THE WATCHMAN OF THE KING HIS WALK IS EXACTLY AS MY HUSBAND'S USED TO BE SHE SAID AND THEN THE THOUGHT BURST UPON HER THAT THE FURZE CUTTER WAS HER SON
HOW BEST TO MAKE HER VISIT APPEAR TO EUSTACIA NOT ABJECT BUT WISE FROM HER ELEVATED POSITION THE EXHAUSTED WOMAN COULD PERCEIVE THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE BELOW AND THE GARDEN
STRANGE NOTIONS HAS HE SAID THE OLD MAN AH THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THAT SENDING TO SCHOOL IN THESE DAYS IT ONLY DOES HARM
ON ITS WAY TO THE SQUARE BIT OF SKY AT THE TOP FROM WHICH THE DAYLIGHT STRUCK DOWN WITH A PALLID GLARE UPON THE TATTERS OF SOOT DRAPING THE FLUE AS SEAWEED DRAPES A ROCKY FISSURE SHE REMEMBERED
WHENEVER IT PREVAILED SOME WERE BLASTED AND SPLIT AS IF BY LIGHTNING BLACK STAINS AS FROM FIRE MARKING THEIR SIDES WHILE THE GROUND AT THEIR FEET WAS STREWN WITH DEAD FIR NEEDLES AND HEAPS OF CONES
SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM AND INQUIRED THE WAY THE LABOURER POINTED OUT THE DIRECTION AND ADDED
MORE SINGULAR STILL THE HEATHMEN HAD INSTINCTIVELY COUPLED HER AND THIS MAN TOGETHER IN THEIR MINDS AS A PAIR BORN FOR EACH OTHER
I'VE NEVER SEEN TOAD SO DETERMINED
IN ORDER THAT ANY MAN WHO MISSED HIS FOOTING MIGHT BE HELD UP BY HIS COMPANIONS THIS SOLID FORMATION WAS PRUDENT BUT DID NOT REMOVE ALL DANGER YET NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DESCENT DOWN STEEPS UNKNOWN TO THE GUIDE
ITS DEPTH APPEARED TO BE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET IMAGINE THE ASPECT OF SUCH A RESERVOIR BRIM FULL AND RUNNING OVER WITH LIQUID FIRE AMID THE ROLLING THUNDER THE BOTTOM OF THE FUNNEL WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FEET IN CIRCUIT
AND FOUR HUNDRED FEET LONG FIRST HE DROPPED HALF OF IT DOWN THEN HE PASSED IT ROUND A LAVA BLOCK THAT PROJECTED CONVENIENTLY AND THREW THE OTHER HALF DOWN THE CHIMNEY EACH OF US COULD THEN DESCEND BY HOLDING WITH THE HAND BOTH HALVES OF THE ROPE
HE WAS LOOKING VERY HARD AT TOAD AS HE SAID THIS AND COULD NOT HELP THINKING HE PERCEIVED SOMETHING VAGUELY RESEMBLING A TWINKLE IN THAT ANIMAL'S STILL SORROWFUL EYE THERE'S ONLY ONE THING MORE TO BE DONE CONTINUED THE GRATIFIED BADGER TOAD
I'LL MAKE ONE MORE EFFORT TO BRING YOU TO REASON YOU WILL COME WITH ME INTO THE SMOKING ROOM AND THERE YOU WILL HEAR SOME FACTS ABOUT YOURSELF AND WE'LL SEE WHETHER YOU COME OUT OF THAT ROOM THE SAME TOAD THAT YOU WENT IN
THE DAY WORE ON AND NO SHADOW CAME TO LAY ITSELF ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER HANS DID NOT MOVE FROM THE SPOT HE HAD SELECTED YET HE MUST BE ASKING HIMSELF WHAT WERE WE WAITING FOR IF HE ASKED HIMSELF ANYTHING AT ALL
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS THEY NEARED THE DOOR IT WAS FLUNG OPEN AND MISTER TOAD ARRAYED IN GOGGLES CAP GAITERS AND ENORMOUS OVERCOAT CAME SWAGGERING DOWN THE STEPS DRAWING ON HIS GAUNTLETED GLOVES HULLO
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE WONDERS OF TERRESTRIAL DEPTHS AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING A RAY OF DAYLIGHT CAME TO WAKE US UP THE THOUSAND SHINING SURFACES OF LAVA ON THE WALLS RECEIVED IT ON ITS PASSAGE AND SCATTERED IT LIKE A SHOWER OF SPARKS
AND I FIND THAT I'M NOT A BIT SORRY OR REPENTANT REALLY SO IT'S NO EARTHLY GOOD SAYING I AM NOW IS IT THEN YOU DON'T PROMISE SAID THE BADGER NEVER TO TOUCH A MOTOR CAR AGAIN CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED TOAD EMPHATICALLY ON THE CONTRARY
AFTER SOME THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BADGER REAPPEARED SOLEMNLY LEADING BY THE PAW A VERY LIMP AND DEJECTED TOAD HIS SKIN HUNG BAGGILY ABOUT HIM
EACH SHOULDERED HIS PACKAGE HANS DROVE BEFORE HIM THE LOAD OF CORDS AND CLOTHES
THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH SURROUNDING OBJECTS WELL AXEL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT CRIED MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS DID YOU EVER SPEND A QUIETER NIGHT IN OUR LITTLE HOUSE AT KOENIGSBERG
INTENDED FOR SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS HE CONSULTED HIS INSTRUMENTS AND RECORDED
I REPUDIATE THE NOTION OF CENTRAL HEAT ALTOGETHER
HAD LOST ALL SCINTILLATION AND WHICH BY MY COMPUTATION SHOULD BE FORTY SIX URSA MINOR
MOREOVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO THROUGH GNEISS
I'D HAVE SAID ANYTHING IN THERE YOU'RE SO ELOQUENT DEAR BADGER AND SO MOVING AND SO CONVINCING AND PUT ALL YOUR POINTS SO FRIGHTFULLY WELL YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH ME IN THERE AND YOU KNOW IT BUT I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY MIND SINCE AND GOING OVER THINGS IN IT
IT WAS A BRIGHT MORNING IN THE EARLY PART OF SUMMER THE RIVER HAD RESUMED ITS WONTED BANKS AND ITS ACCUSTOMED PACE AND A HOT SUN SEEMED TO BE PULLING EVERYTHING GREEN AND BUSHY AND SPIKY UP OUT OF THE EARTH TOWARDS HIM AS IF BY STRINGS
MY UNCLE'S RAGE KNEW NO BOUNDS IT WAS ENOUGH TO IRRITATE A MEEKER MAN THAN HE FOR IT WAS FOUNDERING ALMOST WITHIN THE PORT BUT HEAVEN NEVER SENDS UNMIXED GRIEF
MY HAIR STOOD ON END WITH TERROR THE BEWILDERING FEELING OF VACUITY LAID HOLD UPON ME I FELT MY CENTRE OF GRAVITY SHIFTING ITS PLACE AND GIDDINESS MOUNTING INTO MY BRAIN LIKE DRUNKENNESS
HANS BUILT A HUT OF PIECES OF LAVA I FELT A MALICIOUS PLEASURE IN WATCHING THE THOUSAND RILLS AND CASCADES THAT CAME TUMBLING DOWN THE SIDES OF THE CONE
MY UNCLE TURNED TOO AND FOLLOWED IT AT NOON BEING AT ITS LEAST EXTENT IT CAME AND SOFTLY FELL UPON THE EDGE OF THE MIDDLE CHIMNEY THERE IT IS
THE SHADOW PROJECTED FROM WHICH ON A CERTAIN DAY WOULD POINT OUT THE ROAD TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH NOW NO SUN NO SHADOW AND THEREFORE NO GUIDE HERE WAS JUNE TWENTY FIFTH
I DROPPED AS IT WERE FRANTICALLY CLUTCHING THE DOUBLE CORD WITH ONE HAND AND BUTTRESSING MYSELF FROM THE WALL WITH THE OTHER BY MEANS OF MY STICK ONE IDEA OVERPOWERED ME ALMOST FEAR LEST THE ROCK SHOULD GIVE WAY FROM WHICH I WAS HANGING
NO CRIES OF BASKET WOMEN NO BOATMEN SHOUTING
HANS SLEPT PEACEABLY AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK IN A LAVA BED WHERE HE HAD FOUND A SUITABLE COUCH FOR HIMSELF BUT MY UNCLE WAS PACING AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE I HAD NEITHER THE WISH NOR THE STRENGTH TO RISE
HE MUST NEVER BE LEFT AN INSTANT UNGUARDED WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE IT IN TURNS TO BE WITH HIM TILL THE POISON HAS WORKED ITSELF OUT OF HIS SYSTEM THEY ARRANGED WATCHES ACCORDINGLY
HANS AND THE ICELANDERS NEVER STIRRED
THE FANCIFUL CREATION OF SCANDINAVIAN SUPERSTITIONS I FELT INTOXICATED WITH THE SUBLIME PLEASURE OF LOFTY ELEVATIONS WITHOUT THINKING OF THE PROFOUND ABYSSES INTO WHICH I WAS SHORTLY TO BE PLUNGED
HANS CARRIED THE OTHER APPARATUS WHICH WAS ALSO PUT INTO ACTION THIS INGENIOUS APPLICATION OF ELECTRICITY WOULD ENABLE US TO GO ON FOR A LONG TIME BY CREATING AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INFLAMMABLE GASES NOW MARCH CRIED MY UNCLE
YOU'VE GONE ON SQUANDERING THE MONEY YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU AND YOU'RE GETTING US ANIMALS A BAD NAME IN THE DISTRICT BY YOUR FURIOUS DRIVING AND YOUR SMASHES AND YOUR ROWS WITH THE POLICE
BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GUIDE I HELD MY PEACE MY HEART FLEW BACK TO MY SWEET VIRLANDAISE AND I APPROACHED THE CENTRAL CHIMNEY I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT IT WAS A HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER AND THREE HUNDRED FEET ROUND
AND SENT THEM BODILY DOWN THE GULF BEFORE US I LISTENED TO THE DULL THUDS OF THE DESCENDING BALE MY UNCLE LEANING OVER THE ABYSS FOLLOWED THE DESCENT OF THE LUGGAGE WITH A SATISFIED NOD AND ONLY ROSE ERECT WHEN HE HAD QUITE LOST SIGHT OF IT
OR ELSE HUNTED UP IN HIS OWN HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOOD WHICH WAS A SERIOUS UNDERTAKING THE BADGER STRODE HEAVILY INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD LOOKING AT THE TWO ANIMALS WITH AN EXPRESSION FULL OF SERIOUSNESS THE RAT LET HIS EGG SPOON FALL ON THE TABLE CLOTH AND SAT OPEN MOUTHED
EACH OF US WILL STRAP ONE UPON HIS BACK I MEAN ONLY FRAGILE ARTICLES OF COURSE WE WERE NOT INCLUDED UNDER THAT HEAD HANS SAID HE
THE NEXT MORNING A GREY HEAVY CLOUDY SKY SEEMED TO DROOP OVER THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE I DID NOT KNOW THIS FIRST FROM THE APPEARANCES OF NATURE BUT I FOUND IT OUT BY MY UNCLE'S IMPETUOUS WRATH
CARBONIFEROUS DEVONIAN SILURIAN OR PRIMITIVE WAS ALL ONE TO ME BUT THE PROFESSOR NO DOUBT WAS PURSUING HIS OBSERVATIONS OR TAKING NOTES FOR IN ONE OF OUR HALTS HE SAID TO ME THE FARTHER I GO THE MORE CONFIDENCE I FEEL
AND DURING THAWS THE WHITE BEARS
HIS HEARTY ACCENTS FALTERED AND FELL AWAY AS HE NOTICED THE STERN UNBENDING LOOK ON THE COUNTENANCES OF HIS SILENT FRIENDS AND HIS INVITATION REMAINED UNFINISHED THE BADGER STRODE UP THE STEPS TAKE HIM INSIDE HE SAID STERNLY TO HIS COMPANIONS
VERY WELL THEN SAID THE BADGER FIRMLY RISING TO HIS FEET SINCE YOU WON'T YIELD TO PERSUASION WE'LL TRY WHAT FORCE CAN DO I FEARED IT WOULD COME TO THIS ALL ALONG
IT IS MAGNIFICENT I CRIED SPONTANEOUSLY MY UNCLE WHAT A SIGHT DON'T YOU ADMIRE THOSE BLENDING HUES OF LAVA PASSING FROM REDDISH BROWN TO BRIGHT YELLOW BY IMPERCEPTIBLE SHADES AND THESE CRYSTALS ARE JUST LIKE GLOBES OF LIGHT
THEN THE RAT SAT ON HIM AND THE MOLE GOT HIS MOTOR CLOTHES OFF HIM BIT BY BIT AND THEY STOOD HIM UP ON HIS LEGS AGAIN A GOOD DEAL OF HIS BLUSTERING SPIRIT SEEMED TO HAVE EVAPORATED WITH THE REMOVAL OF HIS FINE PANOPLY
SEATED UPON LOOSE LAVA ROCKS LOOKED AT HIM WITH AS MUCH WONDER AS THEY KNEW HOW TO EXPRESS AND PERHAPS TAKING HIM FOR AN ESCAPED LUNATIC SUDDENLY MY UNCLE UTTERED A CRY I THOUGHT HIS FOOT MUST HAVE SLIPPED AND THAT HE HAD FALLEN DOWN ONE OF THE HOLES
IF THE SUN WAS CLOUDED FOR SIX DAYS WE MUST POSTPONE OUR VISIT TILL NEXT YEAR MY LIMITED POWERS OF DESCRIPTION WOULD FAIL WERE I TO ATTEMPT A PICTURE OF THE PROFESSOR'S ANGRY IMPATIENCE
I DEMAND AN INSTANT EXPLANATION TAKE THEM OFF HIM THEN YOU TWO ORDERED THE BADGER BRIEFLY THEY HAD TO LAY TOAD OUT ON THE FLOOR KICKING AND CALLING ALL SORTS OF NAMES BEFORE THEY COULD GET TO WORK PROPERLY
AND PRESENTLY THEY NOTICED THAT THE SERMON BEGAN TO BE PUNCTUATED AT INTERVALS BY LONG DRAWN SOBS EVIDENTLY PROCEEDING FROM THE BOSOM OF TOAD WHO WAS A SOFT HEARTED AND AFFECTIONATE FELLOW VERY EASILY CONVERTED FOR THE TIME BEING TO ANY POINT OF VIEW
WHEN ONE OF THESE SLIPPERY STEPS SHOOK UNDER THE HEAVIER FORM OF HANS HE SAID IN HIS TRANQUIL VOICE
SO THAT THE GENTLE SLOPE ALLOWED ITS LOWER BRIM TO BE REACHED WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY INVOLUNTARILY I COMPARED THE WHOLE CRATER TO AN ENORMOUS ERECTED MORTAR AND THE COMPARISON PUT ME IN A TERRIBLE FRIGHT WHAT MADNESS I THOUGHT
I THEN REMEMBERED THAT WE HAD SEARCHED FOR IT IN VAIN THE EVENING BEFORE MY UNCLE QUESTIONED HANS WHO AFTER HAVING EXAMINED ATTENTIVELY WITH THE EYE OF A HUNTSMAN REPLIED
THEN AS TOAD WAS HUSTLED THROUGH THE DOOR STRUGGLING AND PROTESTING HE TURNED TO THE CHAUFFEUR IN CHARGE OF THE NEW MOTOR CAR I'M AFRAID YOU WON'T BE WANTED TO DAY HE SAID MISTER TOAD HAS CHANGED HIS MIND
ANOTHER NEW AND EXCEPTIONALLY POWERFUL MOTOR CAR WILL ARRIVE AT TOAD HALL ON APPROVAL OR RETURN AT THIS VERY MOMENT PERHAPS TOAD IS BUSY ARRAYING HIMSELF IN THOSE SINGULARLY HIDEOUS HABILIMENTS SO DEAR TO HIM
AND IT WAS BEGINNING TO GROW DARKER STILL WE KEPT DESCENDING IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE FALLING STONES WERE MEETING WITH AN EARLIER RESISTANCE AND THAT THE CONCUSSION GAVE A MORE ABRUPT AND DEADENED SOUND
NO VARIATION ALWAYS THE SAME CONCLUSION
AT THIS POINT A RUNIC TEXT APPEARS
I STOPPED SHORT JUST AS I WAS GOING TO PLACE MY FEET UPON MY UNCLE'S HEAD
THE ORDER OF THESE VOLCANIC FORMATIONS AFFORDS THE STRONGEST CONFIRMATION TO THE THEORIES OF DAVY
LEANING OVER THE EDGE OF OUR NARROW STANDING GROUND I OBSERVED THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE WAS STILL INVISIBLE THE SAME MANOEUVRE WAS REPEATED WITH THE CORD AND HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE HAD DESCENDED ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED FEET
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO DROP DOWN WHEN A HAND LAID HOLD OF ME IT WAS THAT OF HANS
POINTED TO THIS FACT THAT THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS CAME TO TOUCH THAT PARTICULAR WAY DURING THE LATTER DAYS OF THE MONTH OF JUNE THAT SHARP PEAK MIGHT HENCE BE CONSIDERED AS THE GNOMON OF A VAST SUN DIAL
ADDED THE MOLE TURNING THE KEY ON HIM THEY DESCENDED THE STAIR TOAD SHOUTING ABUSE AT THEM THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND THE THREE FRIENDS THEN MET IN CONFERENCE ON THE SITUATION IT'S GOING TO BE A TEDIOUS BUSINESS SAID THE BADGER SIGHING
THAT ON RAISING MY HEAD AGAIN I SAW ONLY MY UNCLE AND HANS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER THE ICELANDERS HAD BEEN DISMISSED
BUT WE MUST LAY IN A GOOD STOCK FOR WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE MAY HAVE TO GO ON THE BISCUIT AND EXTRACT OF MEAT WERE WASHED DOWN WITH A DRAUGHT OF WATER MINGLED WITH A LITTLE GIN BREAKFAST OVER MY UNCLE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A SMALL NOTEBOOK
THIS GAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT OUR DESCENT WAS MORE HORIZONTAL THAN VERTICAL AS FOR THE EXACT DEPTH REACHED IT WAS VERY EASY TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE PROFESSOR MEASURED ACCURATELY THE ANGLES OF DEVIATION AND INCLINATION ON THE ROAD BUT HE KEPT THE RESULTS TO HIMSELF
THE ORDER TO HALT THEREFORE GAVE ME PLEASURE HANS LAID OUR PROVISIONS UPON A BLOCK OF LAVA AND WE ATE WITH A GOOD APPETITE BUT ONE THING TROUBLED ME OUR SUPPLY OF WATER WAS HALF CONSUMED
THEY SET OFF UP THE ROAD ON THEIR MISSION OF MERCY BADGER LEADING THE WAY ANIMALS WHEN IN COMPANY WALK IN A PROPER AND SENSIBLE MANNER IN SINGLE FILE INSTEAD OF SPRAWLING ALL ACROSS THE ROAD AND BEING OF NO USE OR SUPPORT TO EACH OTHER IN CASE OF SUDDEN TROUBLE OR DANGER
THE NINE THOUGHT WAVES AT THAT AWFUL THING BEFORE ME THE MARTIAN HAD CRAWLED TO MY SIDE AND WITH STARING EYES FIXED ON THE SINGLE PANEL BEFORE US WE WAITED IN THE SILENCE OF DEATH SLOWLY
THE NEXT TWO DAYS BROUGHT NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN THE SUPPLY OF AIR
BESIDES WHEN I'M DOING THIS I'M NOT TELEPHONING YOU TO COME AND AMUSE ME
THEY STARTED ON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THEIR OWN LANDS THE JED OF LESSER HELIUM WITH A SMALL PARTY OF NOBLES ACCOMPANIED THEM ALL THE WAY TO THARK TO CEMENT MORE CLOSELY THE NEW BONDS OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
ANNE STUMBLED SUDDENLY ON IT ONE EVENING WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO ORCHARD SLOPE BY THE WOOD CUT AND CAME OUT INTO THE BARRY GARDEN DIANA BARRY AND FRED WRIGHT WERE STANDING TOGETHER UNDER THE BIG WILLOW DIANA WAS LEANING AGAINST THE GRAY TRUNK HER LASHES CAST DOWN ON VERY CRIMSON CHEEKS
BESPOKE THE UNUSUAL FLASHING THE SIGNALS WHICH PROCLAIMED IT A DISPATCH BEARER FOR THE JEDDAK IT CIRCLED IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE TARDY PATROL BOAT WHICH MUST CONVOY IT TO THE PALACE DOCKS
WAITING HAPPILY FOR THE SUMMER TO BRING LIFE AND LAUGHTER BACK TO IT AGAIN THERE WAS MORE ROMANCE IN THE WORLD THAN THAT WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF THE MIDDLE AGED LOVERS OF THE STONE HOUSE
ANNE HAD NO SOONER UTTERED THE PHRASE HOME O'DREAMS THAN IT CAPTIVATED HER FANCY AND SHE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THE ERECTION OF ONE OF HER OWN IT WAS OF COURSE TENANTED BY AN IDEAL MASTER DARK PROUD AND MELANCHOLY
BILLY WENT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT MAKING PLANS FOR ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT TO BE THROWN TOGETHER NATURALLY JUST AS A MATTER OF COURSE YOU KNOW SHE SAID DROWSILY TO HERSELF ALL IN THE DARK SOME THREE OR FOUR MILES AWAY DOWN BEACON STREET AT THAT MOMENT
CONDITIONS SEEMED MUCH WORSE HERE THAN AT HELIUM AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I BREATHED AT ALL THERE WERE A FEW MEN STILL CONSCIOUS AND TO ONE OF THESE I SPOKE IF I CAN OPEN THESE DOORS IS THERE A MAN WHO CAN START THE ENGINES I ASKED I CAN
I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE MY PART IS ONLY A SMALL ONE YOU KNOW WE SHALL MAKE LOTS OF MONEY FOR THE HOME TOO I'M SURE BUT YOU'RE WEARING YOURSELF ALL OUT WITH IT DEAR SCOWLED BERTRAM
BERTRAM HENSHAW IN THE STRATA WAS AS IT HAPPENED NOT FALLING ASLEEP HE WAS LYING BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE BERTRAM VERY FREQUENTLY LAY BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE THESE DAYS OR RATHER NIGHTS HE TOLD HIMSELF ON THESE OCCASIONS
MARILLA THOUGHT ANNE WAS TOO WORKED UP ABOUT IT AND HAD PLENTY TO DO WITH GETTING READY FOR COLLEGE WITHOUT TRAIPSING TO ECHO LODGE TWO DAYS OUT OF THREE HELPING MISS LAVENDAR
SO I TOLD HER ALL THAT I HAD HEARD WE HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY JOHN CARTER SHE SAID AND I THANK WHATEVER FATE OVERTAKES US THAT IT PERMITS US TO DIE TOGETHER
THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN A YOUNG NOBLE AROSE
I DO NOT NEED TO TELL YOU WHAT THIS MEANS TO BARSOOM IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS TO PENETRATE THOSE MIGHTY WALLS IN FACT THE WORK HAS ALREADY COMMENCED AND THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO FEAR WERE THE ENGINE OF THE PUMPING PLANT TO RUN AS IT SHOULD
SHE GASPED OH IT DOES SEEM SO SO SO HOPELESSLY GROWN UP ANNE OF LATE HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT HER SUSPICIONS THAT DIANA WAS PROVING FALSE TO THE MELANCHOLY BYRONIC HERO OF HER EARLY DREAMS
AIN'T MISTER IRVING SPLENDID HE JUST WORSHIPS THE GROUND SHE TREADS ON AND IT MAKES ME FEEL SO QUEER SOMETIMES TO SEE THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE'S WATCHING HER IT BEGGARS DESCRIPTION MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM I'M AWFUL THANKFUL THEY'RE SO FOND OF EACH OTHER IT'S THE BEST WAY WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE
LAY A SNOW WHITE EGG FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS TEN SOLDIERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD HAD CONSTANTLY STOOD OVER IT AND NOT A DAY PASSED WHEN I WAS IN THE CITY THAT DEJAH THORIS AND I DID NOT STAND HAND IN HAND BEFORE OUR LITTLE SHRINE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE
THAT BILLY'S BREATH DROPPED INTO A FLUTTERING SIGH AND HER CAUSE BECAME SUDDENLY IMPERTINENCE SPELLED IN BLACK CAPITALS THEN MISSUS GREGGORY SPOKE SLOWLY A LITTLE SADLY I DON'T MIND SAYING TO YOU THAT I DID HOPE
I CRIED THERE IS THERE MUST BE SOME WAY AND JOHN CARTER WHO HAS FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH A STRANGE WORLD FOR LOVE OF YOU WILL FIND IT AND WITH MY WORDS THERE CREPT ABOVE THE THRESHOLD OF MY CONSCIOUS MIND A SERIES OF
OH WELL I CAN STILL CALL HIM MARY JANE RETORTED BILLY WITH AIRY DISDAIN ALL THIS HOWEVER SO FAR AS BILLY COULD SEE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST HELPING ALONG THE CAUSE THAT HAD BECOME SO DEAR TO HER
CRIED ANNE REPENTANTLY I WAS ONLY TEASING YOU A BIT I THINK YOU'LL MAKE THE SWEETEST LITTLE HOUSEKEEPER IN THE WORLD AND I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY LOVELY OF YOU TO BE PLANNING ALREADY FOR YOUR HOME O'DREAMS
IF IT ISN'T METHUSELAH JOHN WHAT IS IT THEN BUT ALICE GREGGORY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE TOO IT SEEMED COULD BE FIRM ON OCCASION AND THOUGH SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY ALL SHE WOULD SAY WAS IF HE HASN'T TOLD YOU I SHA'N'T YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO HIM
PROMISED ANNE SOLEMNLY OF COURSE IT WON'T BE FOR EVER SO LONG YET SAID DIANA BLUSHING THREE YEARS AT THE VERY LEAST FOR I'M ONLY EIGHTEEN AND MOTHER SAYS NO DAUGHTER OF HERS SHALL BE MARRIED BEFORE SHE'S TWENTY ONE
BUT EVEN SO IT'S NICE TO THINK ONE WAS AN INSTRUMENT USED BY PREDESTINATION YES INDEED IT'S VERY ROMANTIC I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S SO TERRIBLY ROMANTIC AT ALL SAID MARILLA RATHER CRISPLY
PUSHING THE SPEED LEVER TO ITS LAST NOTCH I SPLIT THE THIN AIR OF DYING MARS WITH THE SPEED OF A METEOR AN HOUR BEFORE DARK THE GREAT WALLS OF THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT LOOMED SUDDENLY BEFORE ME AND WITH A SICKENING
MARILLA GLANCED AT THE RADIANT YOUNG FACE AND REFRAINED FROM FURTHER SARCASTIC COMMENTS PERHAPS SOME REALIZATION CAME TO HER THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE LIKE ANNE THE VISION AND THE FACULTY DIVINE THAT GIFT
BUT THE WORST WE FEAR HAS HAPPENED THE INSTRUMENTS SHOW A RAPIDLY DECREASING AIR PRESSURE ON ALL PARTS OF BARSOOM THE ENGINE HAS STOPPED MY GENTLEMEN HE CONCLUDED WE HAVE AT BEST THREE DAYS TO LIVE
THE TALL SLENDER KIND BUT SOMEHOW I WOULDN'T WANT FRED TO BE TALL AND SLENDER BECAUSE DON'T YOU SEE HE WOULDN'T BE FRED THEN OF COURSE ADDED DIANA RATHER DOLEFULLY WE WILL BE A DREADFULLY PUDGY COUPLE
EVERYBODY CONCERNED IN MISS LAVENDAR'S STORY WAS VERY HAPPY
EARNESTLY SOLICITOUS THAT IT SHOULD BE A SUCCESS SHE EVEN AS HE SOMETIMES HALF IRRITABLY REMEMBERED HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT SHE REALIZED HE BELONGED TO ART BEFORE HE DID TO HIMSELF AND WHEN HE HAD INDIGNANTLY DENIED THIS SHE HAD ONLY LAUGHED AND THROWN A KISS AT HIM
AS IF HE WANTED KATE'S OPINION ON THAT OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT CONCERNED HIM AND BILLY ONCE TORN BY JEALOUSY AND EXASPERATED AT THE FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS OF THEIR QUIET HOURS TOGETHER HE HAD COMPLAINED OPENLY ACTUALLY BILLY IT'S WORSE THAN MARIE'S WEDDING HE DECLARED
HE REPLIED IF YOU OPEN QUICKLY I CAN LAST BUT A FEW MOMENTS MORE BUT IT IS USELESS THEY ARE BOTH DEAD AND NO ONE ELSE UPON BARSOOM KNEW THE SECRET OF THESE AWFUL LOCKS FOR THREE DAYS
THUS HAD COME THE BREAKING OF WHATEVER TIE THERE WAS BETWEEN ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT NOT TO HAVE BROKEN IT WOULD HAVE MEANT FOR ALICE THE PLACING OF HERSELF IN A POSITION WHERE SOMETIME APOLOGIES MUST BE MADE FOR HER FATHER
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGH POETRY AND I THINK IT'S NICER ANNE RECOVERED HERSELF AND HER EYES SHONE AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHED
YOU KNOW TEACHER CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH WAS ANOTHER RADIANT PERSON OH MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM IT HAS ALL TURNED OUT SO BEAUTIFUL
EVER SINCE THE FIRST MEETING OF ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT BILLY HAD BEEN SORELY TROUBLED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE SHE HAD AS SHE MOURNFULLY TOLD HERSELF
OR FAR WORSE STILL WITH OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN IT
THERE'S NOT MUCH COMFORT FOR THE REST OF US IN THAT SEEING THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE FRED LAUGHED ANNE OH ANNE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID DIANA IN VEXATION I DIDN'T MEAN THAT IT'S SO HARD TO EXPLAIN
NEVER MIND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOMETIME WHEN YOUR OWN TURN COMES BLESS YOU DEAREST OF DIANAS I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT IS AN IMAGINATION FOR IF NOT TO ENABLE YOU TO PEEP AT LIFE THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S EYES
BUT THREE YEARS ISN'T ANY TOO MUCH TIME TO GET READY FOR HOUSEKEEPING FOR I HAVEN'T A SPECK OF FANCY WORK MADE YET BUT I'M GOING TO BEGIN CROCHETING DOILIES TOMORROW
A MESSAGE CALLED ME TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER WHICH I FOUND FILLING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THAT BODY ON THE RAISED PLATFORM OF THE THRONE
BANISH GILBERT'S IMAGE FROM HER CASTLE IN SPAIN BUT SOMEHOW HE WENT ON BEING THERE SO ANNE BEING IN A HURRY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT AND PURSUED HER AERIAL ARCHITECTURE WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT HER HOME O'DREAMS WAS BUILT AND FURNISHED BEFORE DIANA SPOKE AGAIN
AND TOLD ANNE THE WHOLE STORY IN THE DUSKY SECLUSION OF THE EAST GABLE BOTH GIRLS CRIED AND KISSED AND LAUGHED I'M SO HAPPY SAID DIANA BUT IT DOES SEEM RIDICULOUS TO THINK OF ME BEING ENGAGED
DID SHE NOT HAVE IT IN HER POWER POSSIBLY EVEN PROBABLY TO BRING HAPPINESS WHERE ONLY SADNESS WAS BEFORE AS IF IT WOULD NOT BE A SIMPLE THING TO REKINDLE THE OLD FLAME TO MAKE THESE TWO ESTRANGED HEARTS BEAT AS ONE AGAIN
I AM GLAD DIANA IS SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED BUT WHEN MY TURN COMES IF IT EVER DOES I DO HOPE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE THRILLING ABOUT IT BUT THEN DIANA THOUGHT SO TOO ONCE
HER VOICE WHEN SHE RESUMED CARRIED THE STERN NOTE SO FAMILIAR TO BILLY IN HER FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER AS I PRESUME MISTER ARKWRIGHT HAS TOLD YOU WE HAVE MET WITH MANY CHANGES IN OUR LIFE CHANGES WHICH NECESSITATED A NEW HOME AND A NEW MODE OF LIVING
SOME ONE THAT HE WAS NOT A FONDNESS THAT WOULD ONE DAY CAUSE BILLY TO AWAKE
SO YOU SEE SHE FINISHED WHEN ALICE GREGGORY HAD DONE LAUGHING OVER THE TALE
AND HASTEN THE ASSISTANT KEEPER TO THE PLANT ALL DAY A THOUSAND CRUISERS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR HIM UNTIL JUST NOW ONE OF THEM RETURNS BEARING HIS DEAD BODY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE PITS BENEATH HIS HOUSE HORRIBLY MUTILATED BY SOME ASSASSIN
BUT MY DEARS BOTH OF YOU BILLY HAD AT LAST SAID TO THEM JUST LISTEN WE SHALL HAVE
NATURALLY UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES OLD FRIENDS AND OLD ROMANCES MUST CHANGE TOO BUT MISSUS GREGGORY STAMMERED BILLY I'M SURE MISTER ARKWRIGHT WOULD WANT AN UP LIFTED HAND SILENCED HER PEREMPTORILY
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE CAUSE AND BERTRAM FEBRUARY CAME THE OPERETTA FOR WHICH BILLY WAS WORKING SO HARD WAS TO BE GIVEN THE TWENTIETH THE ART EXHIBITION FOR WHICH BERTRAM WAS PREPARING HIS FOUR PICTURES WAS TO OPEN THE SIXTEENTH
HER EYES OPENED AND LOOKED INTO MINE KISS ME JOHN CARTER SHE MURMURED I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU IT IS CRUEL THAT WE MUST BE TORN APART WHO WERE JUST STARTING UPON
AS IF SOMEHOW DIANA HAD GONE FORWARD INTO A NEW WORLD SHUTTING A GATE BEHIND HER LEAVING ANNE ON THE OUTSIDE THINGS ARE CHANGING SO FAST IT ALMOST FRIGHTENS ME ANNE THOUGHT A LITTLE SADLY AND I'M AFRAID
THE FACE OF DEJAH THORIS HUNG ALWAYS BEFORE ME AS I TURNED FOR A LAST LOOK AS I LEFT THE PALACE GARDEN I HAD SEEN HER STAGGER AND SINK UPON THE GROUND BESIDE THE LITTLE INCUBATOR THAT SHE HAD DROPPED INTO THE LAST COMA WHICH WOULD END IN DEATH
HE DID NOT WAIT TO QUESTION BUT IN AN INSTANT A GUARD WAS RACING TO THE NEAREST DOCK AND THOUGH THE AIR WAS THIN AND ALMOST GONE AT THE ROOFTOP THEY MANAGED TO LAUNCH THE FASTEST ONE MAN AIR SCOUT MACHINE THAT THE SKILL OF BARSOOM HAD EVER PRODUCED
SOLA ALSO ACCOMPANIED TARS TARKAS HER FATHER WHO BEFORE ALL HIS CHIEFTAINS HAD ACKNOWLEDGED HER AS HIS DAUGHTER
IF THE AIR SUPPLY REMAINED UNREPLENISHED I WELL KNEW AND SO THROWING CAUTION TO THE WINDS I FLUNG OVERBOARD EVERYTHING BUT THE ENGINE AND COMPASS
I SANK UNCONSCIOUS
NOW WHERE IS THE ROMANCE IN ALL THAT OH THERE ISN'T ANY WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY GASPED ANNE RATHER AS IF SOMEBODY HAD THROWN COLD WATER OVER HER I SUPPOSE THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS IN PROSE
AND FULFILL OUR HOPES IN THE DISTANCE WE SAW THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT OF AN APPROACHING AIRSHIP BUT WE ATTACHED NO SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO SO COMMON A SIGHT LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING IT RACED TOWARD HELIUM UNTIL ITS VERY SPEED
HE REPLIED THEY WERE BRIGHTENED BY THE EXERCISE A SHORT PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS SPEECH AND MISSUS HURST BEGAN AGAIN I HAVE AN EXCESSIVE REGARD FOR MISS JANE BENNET SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL
AT LENGTH HIS SISTERS WITH TREMBLING HANDS REPLACED HIS ORIGINAL DISGUISE THE INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT AT HAND BY CAESAR IN EXPECTATION OF SOME SUDDEN EMERGENCY
MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE
INDEED MAMMA YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID ELIZABETH BLUSHING FOR HER MOTHER YOU QUITE MISTOOK MISTER DARCY HE ONLY MEANT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE TO BE MET WITH IN THE COUNTRY AS IN THE TOWN
AND DROVE THE BLOOD FROM THEIR FACES TO THEIR HEARTS WITH A CHILL THAT NEARLY ANNIHILATED FEELING A MAN WHOSE COLOSSAL STATURE MANIFESTED THE POSSESSION OF VAST STRENGTH ENTERED THE ROOM AND REMOVING HIS CAP
SAID MISS BINGLEY WILL SHE BE AS TALL AS I AM I THINK SHE WILL SHE IS NOW ABOUT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET'S HEIGHT OR RATHER TALLER HOW I LONG TO SEE HER AGAIN I NEVER MET
ELIZABETH JOINED THEM AGAIN ONLY TO SAY THAT HER SISTER WAS WORSE AND THAT SHE COULD NOT LEAVE HER BINGLEY URGED MISTER JONES BEING SENT FOR IMMEDIATELY WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE
SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA
IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS
COMPOSE THE SEASON FOR ENJOYMENT IN THE OPEN AIR THEY HAVE THEIR STORMS BUT THEY ARE DISTINCT AND NOT OF LONG CONTINUANCE LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE AND A CLOUDLESS SKY
AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT
THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS HASTILY AND IMPERFECTLY COMPLETED AS THE DRAGOONS ENTERED THE LAWN AND ORCHARD OF THE LOCUSTS RIDING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF THE WIND AND IN THEIR TURN THE WHARTONS WERE SURROUNDED
NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING AND THE MODERN LANGUAGES TO DESERVE THE WORD
DARCY ONLY SMILED AND THE GENERAL PAUSE WHICH ENSUED MADE ELIZABETH TREMBLE LEST HER MOTHER SHOULD BE EXPOSING HERSELF AGAIN SHE LONGED TO SPEAK BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY
WALTER SCOTT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WHARTON FAMILY LAID THEIR HEADS ON THEIR PILLOWS THAT NIGHT WITH A FOREBODING OF SOME INTERRUPTION TO THEIR ORDINARY QUIET UNEASINESS KEPT THE SISTERS FROM ENJOYING THEIR USUAL REPOSE
HIS ANSWER TO THIS SUDDEN ATTACK WAS DELIGHTFUL TO THEIR MOTHER'S EAR I AM PERFECTLY READY I ASSURE YOU TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT AND WHEN YOUR SISTER IS RECOVERED YOU SHALL IF YOU PLEASE NAME THE VERY DAY OF THE BALL
TURNING TO HIS YOUNGER AND EVIDENTLY FAVORITE SISTER AND TAPPING HER CHEEK DID YOU SEE BANNERS IN THE CLOUDS AND MISTAKE MISS PEYTON'S AEOLIAN HARP FOR REBELLIOUS MUSIC NAY HENRY REJOINED THE MAID
HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
THOUGH THE UNTASTED COFFEE SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THAT BY NONE OF HIS RELATIVES WAS HIS ABSENCE DISREGARDED I THINK I DID MUCH BETTER HE CRIED TAKING A CHAIR BETWEEN HIS SISTERS AND RECEIVING THEIR OFFERED SALUTES
THE SISTERS DESCENDED TO THE PARLOR WITH A RETURNING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR BROTHER'S SECURITY AND THEIR OWN HAPPINESS THE FAMILY WERE EARLY IN ASSEMBLING AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND MISS PEYTON WITH A LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE
SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AND THE GOWN WHICH HAD BEEN LET DOWN TO HIDE IT NOT DOING ITS OFFICE YOUR PICTURE MAY BE VERY EXACT LOUISA SAID BINGLEY BUT THIS WAS ALL LOST UPON ME
VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MATTERS OF NO TRIFLING CONCERN WERE ON THE CARPET A SHORT COMMUNICATION WITH THE LOQUACIOUS HOUSEKEEPER FOLLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAIN BODY OF THE TROOP AND THE ADVANCE PARTY REMOUNTING
HIS COUNTENANCE GRADUALLY LIGHTING INTO A SMILE OF PLEASURE
WITH ANYBODY WHO DELIGHTED ME SO MUCH SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY
ON MISS BINGLEY'S APPEARANCE AND INVITATION THE MOTHER AND THREE DAUGHTERS ALL ATTENDED HER INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR BINGLEY MET THEM WITH HOPES THAT MISSUS BENNET HAD NOT FOUND MISS BENNET WORSE THAN SHE EXPECTED
WHICH WAS SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OPENED FOR HIS ADMISSION BY CAESAR THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE TROOPER AS HE FOLLOWED THE BLACK TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR RANG IN THE EARS OF THE FEMALES AS IT APPROACHED NEARER AND NEARER
ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
OF A FINE STOUT HEALTHY LOVE IT MAY EVERYTHING NOURISHES WHAT IS STRONG ALREADY BUT IF IT BE ONLY A SLIGHT THIN SORT OF INCLINATION I AM CONVINCED THAT ONE GOOD SONNET WILL STARVE IT ENTIRELY AWAY
IN ESKE OR LIDDEL FORDS WERE NONE BUT HE WOULD RIDE THEM ONE BY ONE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIME OR TIDE DECEMBER'S SNOW OR JULY'S PRIDE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIDE OR TIME MOONLESS MIDNIGHT OR MATIN PRIME
IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT
SO MUCH THE MAN OF FASHION SO GENTEEL AND EASY HE HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO SAY TO EVERYBODY THAT IS MY IDEA OF GOOD BREEDING AND THOSE PERSONS WHO FANCY THEMSELVES VERY IMPORTANT
THE WORD IS APPLIED TO MANY A WOMAN WHO DESERVES IT NO OTHERWISE THAN BY NETTING A PURSE OR COVERING A SCREEN BUT I AM VERY FAR FROM AGREEING WITH YOU IN YOUR ESTIMATION OF LADIES IN GENERAL
I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED
WHERE THE FAMILY WERE ALREADY COLLECTED IN THE GREATEST CONSTERNATION
AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
MISTER HARPER ECHOED THE OTHER FEELING A LOAD REMOVED FROM HIS HEART YES I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT HE IS GONE AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS CHARACTER WE ARE IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF IT
NOT THAT I THINK CHARLOTTE SO VERY PLAIN BUT THEN SHE IS OUR PARTICULAR FRIEND
FOR MY PART MISTER BINGLEY I ALWAYS KEEP SERVANTS THAT CAN DO THEIR OWN WORK MY DAUGHTERS ARE BROUGHT UP VERY DIFFERENTLY BUT EVERYBODY IS TO JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE LUCASES ARE A VERY GOOD SORT OF GIRLS I ASSURE YOU IT IS A PITY THEY ARE NOT HANDSOME
STILL THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE THOUGH PIERCING WAS NOT BAD AND HIS VOICE THOUGH DEEP AND POWERFUL WAS FAR FROM UNPLEASANT FRANCES VENTURED TO THROW A TIMID GLANCE AT HIS FIGURE AS HE ENTERED
BUT PEOPLE THEMSELVES ALTER SO MUCH
YOU WILL NOT THINK OF QUITTING IT IN A HURRY I HOPE THOUGH YOU HAVE BUT A SHORT LEASE WHATEVER I DO IS DONE IN A HURRY REPLIED HE AND THEREFORE IF I SHOULD RESOLVE TO QUIT NETHERFIELD I SHOULD PROBABLY BE OFF IN FIVE MINUTES
MISTER WHARTON GROANED ALOUD BUT THE LADIES IGNORANT OF THE EXTENT OF THEIR VISITOR'S KNOWLEDGE REMAINED IN TREMBLING YET RIGID SILENCE THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF MOVED HIS HAND INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS HEAD
I DO NOT TRUST MY OWN PARTIALITY WHEN SHE WAS ONLY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A MAN AT MY BROTHER GARDINER'S IN TOWN SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT MY SISTER IN LAW WAS SURE HE WOULD MAKE HER AN OFFER BEFORE WE CAME AWAY
OH YES I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY I WISH I MIGHT TAKE THIS FOR A COMPLIMENT BUT TO BE SO EASILY SEEN THROUGH I AM AFRAID IS PITIFUL THAT IS AS IT HAPPENS
TO ME HE WAS A TOTAL STRANGER YOU HAVE BUT LITTLE TO APPREHEND FROM HIS CHARACTER ANSWERED THE DRAGOON DRYLY BUT HE IS GONE HOW WHEN AND WHITHER
REMOVED CRIED BINGLEY IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT OF MY SISTER I AM SURE WILL NOT HEAR OF HER REMOVAL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MADAM SAID MISS BINGLEY WITH COLD CIVILITY
HIS HOUSE WAS SURROUNDED BY A DOZEN SENTINELS TWO OR THREE OF THE DRAGOONS NOW DISMOUNTED AND DISAPPEARED IN A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO THE YARD FOLLOWED BY KATY FROM WHOSE
MY BUSINESS WILL BE CONFINED TO A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH IF FREELY ANSWERED WILL INSTANTLY REMOVE US FROM YOUR DWELLING AND WHAT MAY THEY BE SIR STAMMERED MISTER WHARTON
AND SAW AT ONCE THE MAN FROM WHOSE SCRUTINY HARVEY BIRCH HAD WARNED THEM THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE APPREHENDED YOU HAVE NO CAUSE FOR ALARM LADIES SAID THE OFFICER PAUSING A MOMENT AND CONTEMPLATING THE PALE FACES AROUND HIM
AND BY THAT TIME MOST LIKELY CAPTAIN CARTER WOULD BE AT MERYTON AGAIN AND WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR BALL SHE ADDED I SHALL INSIST ON THEIR GIVING ONE ALSO I SHALL TELL COLONEL FORSTER IT WILL BE QUITE A SHAME IF HE DOES NOT
GAINING THE LAWN IN EARNEST AND APPARENTLY PLEASED CONVERSATION WITH HIS TWO SUBALTERNS IN A FEW MOMENTS ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE TROOPS AND HORSEMEN LEFT THE VALLEY AT FULL SPEED BY ITS VARIOUS ROADS
SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAS RATHER AFFECTED YOUR ADMIRATION OF HER FINE EYES
AND NEVER OPEN THEIR MOUTHS QUITE MISTAKE THE MATTER DID CHARLOTTE DINE WITH YOU NO SHE WOULD GO HOME I FANCY SHE WAS WANTED ABOUT THE MINCE PIES
CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES
WHICH YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE TRUE CERTAINLY MY DEAR NOBODY SAID THERE WERE BUT AS TO NOT MEETING WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW NEIGHBOURHOODS LARGER I KNOW WE DINE WITH FOUR AND TWENTY FAMILIES
INDEED I HAVE SIR WAS HER ANSWER SHE IS A GREAT DEAL TOO ILL TO BE MOVED MISTER JONES SAYS WE MUST NOT THINK OF MOVING HER WE MUST TRESPASS A LITTLE LONGER ON YOUR KINDNESS
AND WHEN THEY WERE GETTING BETTER THEY USED TO SIT IN CHAIRS ON THE LAWN AND OFTEN EVEN AFTER THEY GOT WELL THEY DID NOT WANT TO GO AWAY THEY LIKED THE DOCTOR AND HIS HOUSE SO MUCH
JUST LOOK AT PERCIVAL B SLOOP A MOST UNPLEASANT SORT OF GOOP HE POKES HIS FINGERS IN HIS NOSE AND WIPES HIS HANDS UPON HIS CLOTHES HE DOES A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU
SAYS YOUNG AMELIA PRATT I WON'T DO THIS I WON'T DO THAT NOW ISN'T WON'T THE NAUGHTIEST WORD
OF NAUGHTY ONES DON'T BE A GOOP MARMADUKE ARGYLL
HE IS NOT ALWAYS DOOMED TO BE
AND YET HOW VERY VERY FEW DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE TWO WHILE EVEN MISTER BURBANK CAN'T
I WONDER IF YOU EVER MEET
A GOOP THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME SMILE IS THIS ONE MARMADUKE ARGYLL HIS MOUTH IS FULL FROM CHEEK TO CHEEK
BUT WITHOUT MONEY THEY FOUND IT VERY HARD THEN THE ANIMALS MADE A VEGETABLE AND FLOWER STALL OUTSIDE THE GARDEN GATE AND SOLD RADISHES AND ROSES TO THE PEOPLE THAT PASSED BY ALONG THE ROAD BUT STILL
THE OLD LADIES GREW AFRAID TO SEND THEIR LAP DOGS TO DOCTOR DOLITTLE BECAUSE OF THE CROCODILE AND THE FARMERS WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD NOT EAT THE LAMBS AND SICK CALVES THEY BROUGHT TO BE CURED
IN FACT HE HAS WORKED HIMSELF ALMOST TO DEATH WHILE THE LAZY ASPARAGUS SO IT IS SAID SPENDS ALL OF HIS TIME IN THE SPARAGUS BED THE TERN
MISS MACKADOO SHE NEVER SPEAKS WHEN SPOKEN TO WHEN SPOKEN TO SHE TURNS HER EYES AND NEVER ANSWERS OR REPLIES SHE HANGS HER HEAD AND SUCKS HER THUMB
SIX THE MASTER SAID THE YOUNG SHOULD BE DUTIFUL AT HOME
AND GRAVELY FROM HIS PRAYER BOOK READS
IT IS FOR OUR SAKES THAT THE OLD MAN FINDS HIMSELF SO LONELY AND SO POOR SO IT WAS AGREED THAT THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE WAS TO DO THE COOKING AND MENDING THE DOG WAS TO SWEEP THE FLOORS THE DUCK WAS TO DUST AND MAKE THE BEDS
NOT EVERY ONE IS ALWAYS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A VEGETABLE FOR SOME ARE GUIDED BY TRADITION WHILE OTHERS USE THEIR INTUITION AND EVEN I MAKE NO PRETENSE OF HAVING MORE THAN COMMON SENSE
AND SOON NOW THE DOCTOR BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY AGAIN AND HIS SISTER SARAH BOUGHT A NEW DRESS AND WAS HAPPY SOME OF THE ANIMALS WHO CAME TO SEE HIM WERE SO SICK THAT THEY HAD TO STAY AT THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE FOR A WEEK
LETTING WATER FLOOD THE SINK ANDREW WAS A GOOP I THINK
SHE CALLED HER SISTER HORRID NAMES SHE CALLED HER BROTHER NAMES AS WELL SO BAD I WOULDN'T DARE TO TELL IT'S SHOCKING HOW A GOOP WILL ACT
HE USED TO PINCH HE USED TO POKE AND CALLED HIS RUDENESS JUST A JOKE WHAT MADE HIM PLAGUE HIS PLAYMATES SO HE WAS A GOOP AND DIDN'T KNOW
IS CLASSIFIED A BIRD OF PREY IBISCUS WE HAVE HEARD RELATED THE CRIMSON EYE IS DESIGNATED THEIR DIFFERENCE IS PLAIN INDEED THE FLOWER IS RED THE BIRD CAN READ THE BUTTER BALL
SWEEPING HIS TAIL OVER THE FLOOR WITH A RAG TIED ONTO IT FOR A BROOM AFTER A LITTLE THEY GOT TO DO THE WORK SO WELL THAT THE DOCTOR SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER HAD HIS HOUSE KEPT SO TIDY OR SO CLEAN BEFORE IN THIS WAY
FIGURED IT OUT THAT THERE WAS ONLY MONEY ENOUGH LEFT TO LAST ANOTHER WEEK IF THEY EACH HAD ONE MEAL A DAY AND NO MORE THEN THE PARROT SAID I THINK WE ALL OUGHT TO DO THE HOUSEWORK OURSELVES AT LEAST WE CAN DO THAT MUCH AFTER ALL
NOW THE FARMERS AND THE OLD LADIES ARE AFRAID TO SEND THEIR ANIMALS TO YOU JUST AS WE WERE BEGINNING TO BE WELL OFF AGAIN NOW WE SHALL BE RUINED ENTIRELY THIS IS THE LAST STRAW I WILL NO LONGER BE HOUSEKEEPER FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T SEND AWAY THAT ALLIGATOR
IS ALMOST ALWAYS IN THE WAY IN THE ROOM OR IN THE STREET ALWAYS UNDER PEOPLE'S FEET GOOPS LIKE THAT ANNOY ME SO YOU KEEP OUT THE WAY I KNOW
DON'T BE SO FUSSY I TELL YOU I WILL NOT HAVE HIM AROUND SAID SARAH HE EATS THE LINOLEUM IF YOU DON'T SEND HIM AWAY THIS MINUTE I'LL I'LL GO AND GET MARRIED ALL RIGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
MISS GWENDOLYN DE VERE DE WITT
I ALWAYS THINK OF SUSIE KLEIN I THINK OF HOW SHE HANGS HER HEAD SHE DOESN'T SPEAK SHE WHINES INSTEAD DON'T WHINE IF YOU DON'T SPEAK RIGHT OUT
AND SO IT SHOULD DIRECT YOUR WAY TO GOOD BEHAVIOR EVERY DAY THE CHILDREN OF WHOSE FAULTS I TELL
BUT HE WEPT SUCH BIG TEARS AND BEGGED SO HARD TO BE ALLOWED TO STAY THAT THE DOCTOR HADN'T THE HEART TO TURN HIM OUT SO THEN THE DOCTOR'S SISTER CAME TO HIM AND SAID
THE PELICAN
SO LONG AS THE HENS LAY EGGS AND THE COW GIVES MILK WE CAN HAVE OMELETTES AND JUNKET AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF VEGETABLES LEFT IN THE GARDEN THE WINTER IS STILL A LONG WAY OFF DON'T FUSS THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH SARAH SHE WOULD FUSS
ALWAYS MESSES WITH HER FOOD ALWAYS PLAYS WITH HER POTATOES MEAT AND GRAVY AND TOMATOES

WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED WITH YOUR PLAY
MOTHER ALWAYS IS DISTRESSED IF YOU FIDGET WHEN YOU'RE DRESSED IF YOU FIDGET LIKE MISS MIDGET HOPPER OR HER SISTER BRIDGET GOOPS LIKE THAT ARE SO MUCH BOTHER THAT THEY OUGHT TO DRESS EACH OTHER
IF YOU SHOULD ASK WHY ROSAMUND ELIZA PUDDINGFOOT WAS SHUNNED I'D SAY BECAUSE SHE'D ALWAYS CHEAT IN EVERY GAME SO SHE COULD BEAT ONLY A GOOP WOULD ACT THAT WAY
BUT THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM THAT IF HE DIDN'T GO AWAY HE WOULD PUNCH HIM ON THE NOSE JOHN DOLITTLE WAS A STRONG MAN THOUGH HE WASN'T VERY TALL
WHEN JOHN D PELL WANTS SOMETHING DONE D'YOU THINK HE ASKS OF ANYONE OH NO HE ORDERS SOMEONE TO WITH GET MY HAT OR TIE MY SHOE THE GOOPS ALL SAY RUDE THINGS LIKE THESE BUT YOU OF COURSE SAY
HE WAS POORER THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE WITH ALL THESE MOUTHS TO FILL AND THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER AND NO ONE TO DO THE MENDING AND NO MONEY COMING IN TO PAY THE BUTCHER'S BILL THINGS BEGAN TO LOOK VERY DIFFICULT BUT THE DOCTOR DIDN'T WORRY AT ALL
OF COURSE AT FIRST THEY ALL FOUND THEIR NEW JOBS VERY HARD TO DO ALL EXCEPT CHEE CHEE WHO HAD HANDS AND COULD DO THINGS LIKE A MAN BUT THEY SOON GOT USED TO IT AND THEY USED TO THINK IT GREAT FUN TO WATCH JIP THE DOG
WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT PLACES FOR THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANIMALS HE TOO WANTED TO LIVE WITH THE DOCTOR HE ASKED COULDN'T HE SLEEP IN THE FISH POND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN IF HE PROMISED NOT TO EAT THE FISH
ALWAYS WHISPERING IN CHURCH ALWAYS PLAYING WITH THE BOOKS NEVER CARING HOW SHE LOOKS
GO AND GET MARRIED IT CAN'T BE HELPED AND HE TOOK DOWN HIS HAT AND WENT OUT INTO THE GARDEN SO SARAH DOLITTLE PACKED UP HER THINGS AND WENT OFF AND THE DOCTOR WAS LEFT ALL ALONE WITH HIS ANIMAL FAMILY AND VERY SOON
SO BILDAD WOULD NOT SHARE HIS TOYS OR LEND THEM TO THE OTHER BOYS HE WAS A GOOP AND SO ARE YOU IF YOU ARE EVER SELFISH TOO
THOUGH JUMBO LOVES TO FUSS AND FIGHT
TO GUIDE A LAND OF A THOUSAND CHARIOTS
THE DOCTOR SAW AT ONCE THAT THE MONKEY'S COLLAR WAS TOO TIGHT AND THAT HE WAS DIRTY AND UNHAPPY SO HE TOOK THE MONKEY AWAY FROM THE ITALIAN GAVE THE MAN A SHILLING AND TOLD HIM TO GO
OH SAYS LITTLE SUSIE SMALT
I WONDER HOW SARAH'S GETTING ON AN EXCELLENT WOMAN IN SOME WAYS WELL WELL BUT THE SNOW CAME EARLIER THAN USUAL THAT YEAR AND ALTHOUGH THE OLD LAME HORSE HAULED IN PLENTY OF WOOD FROM THE FOREST OUTSIDE THE TOWN
SO THEY COULD HAVE A BIG FIRE IN THE KITCHEN MOST OF THE VEGETABLES IN THE GARDEN WERE GONE AND THE REST WERE COVERED WITH SNOW
OF A GOOP WHOSE NAME WAS EZRA HECHT OF COURSE HE WOULD REFUSE TO HEED OR MIND HIS MOTHER YES INDEED OF COURSE HE WOULD OF COURSE HE DID BUT YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU ARE BID
AND ONE EVENING WHEN THE DOCTOR WAS ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE THEY BEGAN TALKING IT OVER AMONG THEMSELVES IN WHISPERS AND THE OWL TOO TOO WHO WAS GOOD AT ARITHMETIC
FOUR
THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY ALL THE BILLS AND STILL THE DOCTOR WOULDN'T WORRY WHEN THE PARROT CAME TO HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT THE FISHMONGER WOULDN'T GIVE THEM ANY MORE FISH HE SAID NEVER MIND
THE OWL TOO TOO WAS TO KEEP THE ACCOUNTS AND THE PIG WAS TO DO THE GARDENING THEY MADE POLYNESIA THE PARROT HOUSEKEEPER AND LAUNDRESS BECAUSE SHE WAS THE OLDEST
IT ISN'T AN ALLIGATOR SAID THE DOCTOR IT'S A CROCODILE I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL IT SAID HIS SISTER IT'S A NASTY THING TO FIND UNDER THE BED I WON'T HAVE IT IN THE HOUSE
FREDDIE FISHER FAIRLY FUSSED WHEN HE CAME TO EAT HIS CRUST OFTEN ON THE FLOOR HE'D THROW IT HOPING MOTHER WOULDN'T KNOW IT GOOPS ALL HATE TO EAT THE CRUST IF YOU'RE TOLD TO THEN YOU MUST
HOW THOUGHTLESS WAS ROBERTO LEES FOR ONLY THOUGHTLESS CHILDREN TEASE HE TEASED THE LITTLE PUSSY CAT HE TEASED THE PUPPY THINK OF THAT HE EVEN TEASED HIS SISTER TOO I THINK HE WAS A GOOP
WHILE ORCHIDS CAN BE FOUND IN LEGIONS WITHIN THE EQUATORIAL REGIONS THE GRACEFUL ORCHID ON ITS STALK
SHE'S THE GOOPIEST GOOP OF ALL
THE OTHER ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE CALLED HIM CHEE CHEE WHICH IS A COMMON WORD IN MONKEY LANGUAGE MEANING GINGER AND ANOTHER TIME
NUFFIN UPON THIS CAKE OF ICE IS PERCHED THE PADDLE FOOTED PUFFIN TO FIND HIS DOUBLE WE HAVE SEARCHED BUT HAVE DISCOVERED NUFFIN AUTHOR'S APOLOGY
FROM MORN TILL NIGHT LIKE ANYTHING THE QUACKING OF THE BUTTER BALL CANNOT BE CALLED A SONG AT ALL
MONEY IS A NUISANCE HE USED TO SAY WE'D ALL BE MUCH BETTER OFF IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN INVENTED WHAT DOES MONEY MATTER SO LONG AS WE ARE HAPPY BUT SOON THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO GET WORRIED
IS SURELY WORTHY OF REMARK ALTHOUGH TO SEE IT WE REQUIRE THE AID OF A SMALL MAGNIFIER
BUT HE HAS PROMISED ME THE DOCTOR ANSWERED THAT HE WILL NOT BITE ANY ONE HE DOESN'T LIKE THE CIRCUS AND I HAVEN'T THE MONEY TO SEND HIM BACK TO AFRICA WHERE HE COMES FROM HE MINDS HIS OWN BUSINESS AND ON THE WHOLE IS VERY WELL BEHAVED
WHEN THE CIRCUS MEN CAME TO TAKE HIM BACK HE GOT SO WILD AND SAVAGE THAT HE FRIGHTENED THEM AWAY BUT TO EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE HE WAS ALWAYS AS GENTLE AS A KITTEN BUT NOW
THOUGH CORALIE WAS SMALL AND SWEET
SO IN THIS WAY HE WENT ON GETTING MORE AND MORE PETS ONCE WHEN HE WAS SITTING ON HIS GARDEN WALL SMOKING A PIPE IN THE EVENING AN ITALIAN ORGAN GRINDER CAME ROUND WITH A MONKEY ON A STRING
YOU CAN EASILY TELL THEM APART WITHOUT FAIL BY MERELY OBSERVING THE RUE LACKS DE TAIL THE PARROT
A THING WHICH EVERYONE SHOULD LEARN OBSERVE THE TERN UP IN THE AIR SEE HOW HE TURNS AND NOW COMPARE HIM WITH THIS INERT VEGETABLE WHO THUS TO TURN IS QUITE UNABLE FOR HE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT WHILE AS WE SEE THE TERN IS NOT

OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR

THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HIM JANE KNEW BUT SHE FELT UTTERLY UNABLE TO ARRANGE HOW OR IN WHAT WAY HER GOING COULD BE MANAGED THAT IT WAS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM HER COMMON SENSE TOLD HER
AND THIS NIGHT AND DAY TRAVELLING HAD BROUGHT HER AT LAST WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SHORES OF ENGLAND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WOULD SET FOOT UPON THEM AND THEN THERE WOULD BE BUT TWO MORE STAGES TO HER JOURNEY FOR FROM THE MOMENT SHE STARTED
JANE STOOD AT THE WINDOW OF HER COMPARTMENT AS THE TRAIN STEAMED INTO CHARING CROSS THE DOCTOR WAS STATIONED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THE DOOR WHEN HER CARRIAGE CAME TO A STANDSTILL

JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME
I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MISTER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY
YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY
BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
PEOPLE WHO CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA AND TALK ABOUT IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CRAWL ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MOTHER ISN'T SHE WORTH KNOWING I HOPE SHE SENT ME HER LOVE AND NEW YORK HARBOUR
AND THE SCANDAL MONGERS HAVE GREEDILY SEIZED THE RUMOUR TO MAKE IT THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN INFERNAL STRUCTURE WELL BUT GILBERT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TO COUNTENANCE SUCH REPORTS DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN HER MANNER
SHE READ HIS TELEGRAM THROUGH ONCE MORE AND SMILED HOW LIKE HIM TO THINK OF THE COFFEE AND OH HOW LIKE HIM TO BE COMING TO THE STATION SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND LEANED BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONS
HERE YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL FOR ME NO NEVER MIND THE CHANGE COFFEE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SHOULD FETCH A FANCY PRICE GOOD BYE THE TRAIN MOVED ON AND THE PORTER STOOD LOOKING AFTER IT WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES
WHO KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS ASKING THAT HE MIGHT CATCH THE EYE OF A GENEROUS TRAVELLER HE FELT HE HAD INDEED BEEN LED TO THIS PLAIN BROWN FACED BROAD SHOULDERED LADY WHEN HE REMEMBERED HOW NEARLY
OVER THE FIRST HALF CROWN HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF MILK AND NEW LAID EGGS NOW AS HE POCKETED THE SECOND HE ADDED THE OTHER TWO THINGS MENTIONED BY THE PARISH DOCTOR SOUP AND JELLY AND HIS HEART GLOWED
BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
THIS STRUCK ME AS A PRETTY NEEDLESS QUESTION TO SAY THE LEAST WELL CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON I ADMIT CAPTAIN I'M NOT YET ON VERY FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THAT GENUS OF FISH WE'RE USED TO THEM
AND WE'LL ARRIVE THERE LATE TONIGHT
THEN THEY REMOVE THE OYSTER'S MEATY TISSUE BOIL IT AND FINALLY STRAIN IT IN ORDER TO EXTRACT EVEN THE SMALLEST PEARLS DO THE PRICES OF THESE PEARLS DIFFER DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE CONSEIL ASKED NOT ONLY ON THEIR SIZE I REPLIED
AND IF BY CHANCE SOME EAGER FISHERMAN ARRIVES EARLY WELL WE CAN WATCH HIM AT WORK THAT SUITS ME CAPTAIN BY THE WAY PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF SHARKS ARE YOU SHARKS I EXCLAIMED
HAS JUST MADE US A VERY PLEASANT PROPOSITION OH I SAID YOU KNOW ABOUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER HAS INVITED US TOGETHER WITH MASTER
DIVE IN ROTATION AND DESCEND TO A DEPTH OF TWELVE METERS WITH THE HELP OF A HEAVY STONE CLUTCHED BETWEEN THEIR FEET AND ATTACHED BY A ROPE TO THEIR BOAT YOU MEAN I SAID
BRIGHT AND EARLY THIS SAID IN A CAREFREE TONE CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE LOUNGE IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT BEARS IN THE SWISS MOUNTAINS YOU MIGHT SAY OH GOOD I GET TO GO BEAR HUNTING TOMORROW
THEY FORM IN ISOLATION WITHIN THE MOLLUSK'S TISSUE THEY'RE WHITE OFTEN OPAQUE BUT SOMETIMES OF OPALESCENT TRANSPARENCY AND USUALLY SPHERICAL OR PEAR SHAPED THE SPHERICAL ONES ARE MADE INTO BRACELETS
THAT SUCH PRIMITIVE METHODS ARE STILL ALL THAT THEY USE ALL
IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT LIONS ON THE ATLAS PLAINS OR TIGERS IN THE JUNGLES OF INDIA YOU MIGHT SAY HA NOW'S MY CHANCE TO HUNT LIONS AND TIGERS BUT IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT SHARKS IN THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT
NECKS AND EARS THAT'S OBLONG IN SHAPE GLASSY IN LUSTER AND FORMED FROM MOTHER OF PEARL FOR CHEMISTS IT'S A MIXTURE OF CALCIUM PHOSPHATE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE WITH A LITTLE GELATIN PROTEIN
CONSEIL SAID TO ME GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON PEARL FISHING ON THE FISHING ITSELF I ASKED OR ON THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS THAT ON THE FISHING THE CANADIAN REPLIED BEFORE WE TACKLE THE TERRAIN IT HELPS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT
CONSEIL PUT IN AND WHY NOT WHAT GOOD WOULD A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS DO US HERE ON THE NAUTILUS HERE NO NED LAND SAID BUT ELSEWHERE OH ELSEWHERE CONSEIL PUT IN
THE SEAS OF CHINA AND JAPAN PLUS THOSE SEAS SOUTH OF THE UNITED STATES THE GULF OF PANAMA AND THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S OFF CEYLON THAT SUCH FISHING REAPS ITS RICHEST REWARDS NO DOUBT WE'LL BE ARRIVING A LITTLE EARLY
THAT VALUABLE SHELLFISH PEARLS RESULT SIMPLY FROM MOTHER OF PEARL SOLIDIFYING INTO A GLOBULAR SHAPE EITHER THEY STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL OR THEY BECOME EMBEDDED IN THE CREATURE'S FOLDS
MAYBE THAT'S WHY KATE TENDER MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE REPLIED MISTER LAND PHILOSOPHICALLY BUT I SAID GETTING BACK TO PEARLS OF GREAT VALUE I DON'T THINK ANY SOVEREIGN EVER POSSESSED ONE SUPERIOR TO THE PEARL OWNED BY CAPTAIN NEMO
THAT PEARL DANGLING FROM THE LOWER LOBE OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA I WENT LOOKING IN THE LIBRARY FOR A BOOK ABOUT THIS ISLAND ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE IN THE WORLD SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A VOLUME ENTITLED CEYLON AND THE SINGHALESE
FOR ORIENTALS IT'S A DROP OF SOLIDIFIED DEW FOR THE LADIES IT'S A JEWEL
NED LAND YELPED DID I SAY SHARKS I EXCLAIMED HASTILY I MEANT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEARLS SHARKS WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE INDEED CONSEIL SAID
MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED LAUGHING THOSE WERE ARTIFICIAL PEARLS ORDINARY GLASS BEADS WHOSE INSIDES WERE COATED WITH ESSENCE OF ORIENT WOW
FOR MY PART I STARED AT THEM WITH ANXIOUS EYES AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY MISSING A LIMB OR TWO SHOULD I ALERT THEM YES SURELY BUT I HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT WOULD MASTER
WELL HOW ABOUT YOU CONSEIL WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THESE MAN EATERS ME CONSEIL SAID I'M AFRAID I MUST BE FRANK WITH MASTER GOOD FOR YOU I THOUGHT
THOSE NOT SLIPPING THROUGH THE SIEVES PIERCED WITH ONE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED HOLES ARE IN THE SECOND ORDER FINALLY THOSE PEARLS FOR WHICH ONE USES STRAINERS PIERCED WITH NINE HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND HOLES MAKE UP THE SEED PEARLS
DANGEROUS NED LAND REPLIED A SIMPLE TRIP TO AN OYSTERBANK ASSUREDLY
BUT NOW THEY BRING IN ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THAT AMOUNT ALL IN ALL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NINE MILLION FRANCS IS THE CURRENT YEARLY RETURN FOR THE WHOLE PEARL HARVESTING INDUSTRY BUT CONSEIL ASKED
DANGER HOWEVER GREAT HELD A PERENNIAL ATTRACTION FOR HIS AGGRESSIVE NATURE I WENT BACK TO READING SIRR'S BOOK BUT I LEAFED THROUGH IT MECHANICALLY BETWEEN THE LINES I KEPT SEEING FEARSOME WIDE OPEN JAWS
BY THE WAY GALLANT NED ARE YOU AFRAID OF SHARKS
HOW INGENIOUS CONSEIL SAID TO REDUCE DIVIDING AND CLASSIFYING PEARLS TO A MECHANICAL OPERATION AND COULD MASTER TELL US THE PROFITS BROUGHT IN BY HARVESTING THESE BANKS OF PEARL OYSTERS ACCORDING TO SIRR'S BOOK I REPLIED
THE REST OF US CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED AND IN TIME YOU WILL BE TOO ANYHOW WE'LL BE ARMED AND ON OUR WAY WE MIGHT HUNT A MAN EATER OR TWO IT'S A FASCINATING SPORT SO PROFESSOR I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
AROUND WHICH THE MOTHER OF PEARL IS DEPOSITED IN THIN CONCENTRIC LAYERS OVER SEVERAL YEARS IN SUCCESSION CAN ONE FIND SEVERAL PEARLS IN THE SAME OYSTER CONSEIL ASKED YES MY BOY
THAT ESSENCE OF ORIENT MUST SELL FOR QUITE A LARGE SUM AS LITTLE AS ZERO IT COMES FROM THE SCALES OF A EUROPEAN CARP IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A SILVER SUBSTANCE THAT COLLECTS IN THE WATER AND IS PRESERVED IN AMMONIA IT'S WORTHLESS
ONLY ONE PENNY TO THOSE POOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYERS RICH THAT'S ATROCIOUS ON THAT NOTE PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME
IT'S EVEN SAID THAT IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN WHEN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT WENT FISHING ON ITS OWN BEHALF ITS DIVERS WORKED JUST TWENTY DAYS AND BROUGHT UP SEVENTY SIX MILLION OYSTERS
I'VE EVEN HEARD STORIES THE CANADIAN SAID ABOUT SOME LADY IN ANCIENT TIMES WHO DRANK PEARLS IN VINEGAR CLEOPATRA CONSEIL SHOT BACK IT MUST HAVE TASTED PRETTY BAD NED LAND ADDED ABOMINABLE NED MY FRIEND
IN OTHER WORDS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THAT OF IRELAND JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER APPEARED THE CAPTAIN GLANCED AT THE CHART THEN TURNING TO ME THE ISLAND OF CEYLON HE SAID
JUST THEN CONSEIL AND THE CANADIAN ENTERED WITH A CALM EVEN GLEEFUL AIR LITTLE DID THEY KNOW WHAT WAS WAITING FOR THEM YE GODS SIR NED LAND TOLD ME YOUR CAPTAIN NEMO THE DEVIL TAKE HIM
BUT YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY TRUST ME ON THIS PROFESSOR ITS PEARLS WERE SO BIG
AND ONE THAT EXISTS ONLY TO GRATIFY THE WHIMS OF FASHION BUT TELL ME CAPTAIN HOW MANY OYSTERS CAN A BOAT FISH UP IN A WORKDAY
ONLY DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH AND FOR THIRTY DAYS SOME THREE HUNDRED BOATS CONCENTRATE ON THE LUCRATIVE HARVEST OF THESE TREASURES FROM THE SEA EACH BOAT IS MANNED BY TEN OARSMEN AND TEN FISHERMEN THE LATTER DIVIDE INTO TWO GROUPS
LINING THE INSIDES OF THEIR VALVES ARE MUSSELS INCLUDED TOO THE CANADIAN ASKED YES THE MUSSELS OF CERTAIN STREAMS IN SCOTLAND WALES IRELAND SAXONY BOHEMIA AND FRANCE
YET IT STRIKES ME THAT DIVING SUITS LIKE YOURS COULD PERFORM YEOMAN SERVICE IN SUCH WORK YES SINCE THOSE POOR FISHERMEN CAN'T STAY LONG UNDERWATER ON HIS VOYAGE TO CEYLON
BUT WILL MASTER NOW TELL US HOW ONE GOES ABOUT EXTRACTING THESE PEARLS ONE PROCEEDS IN SEVERAL WAYS AND OFTEN WHEN PEARLS STICK TO THE VALVES FISHERMEN EVEN PULL THEM LOOSE WITH PLIERS
TURBO SNAILS GIANT CLAMS AND SALTWATER SCALLOPS BRIEFLY ALL THOSE THAT SECRETE MOTHER OF PEARL IN OTHER WORDS THAT BLUE AZURE VIOLET OR WHITE SUBSTANCE
THE CANADIAN SAID NO MY FRIEND THAT TASK IS PERFORMED WITH ELEVEN STRAINERS OR SIEVES THAT ARE PIERCED WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF HOLES THOSE PEARLS STAYING IN THE STRAINERS WITH TWENTY TO EIGHTY HOLES ARE IN THE FIRST ORDER
THIS ONE CONSEIL SAID POINTING TO A MAGNIFICENT JEWEL IN ITS GLASS CASE EXACTLY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT FAR OFF WHEN I ESTIMATE ITS VALUE AT TWO MILLION UH FRANCS
THE SMALLEST PEARLS ARE KNOWN BY THE NAME SEED PEARLS THEY'RE PRICED BY THE MEASURING CUP AND ARE USED MAINLY IN THE CREATION OF EMBROIDERY FOR CHURCH VESTMENTS BUT IT MUST BE A LONG HARD JOB SORTING OUT THESE PEARLS BY SIZE
THE ENGLISHMAN PERCIVAL MADE MUCH OF A KAFFIR WHO STAYED UNDER FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT COMING UP TO THE SURFACE BUT I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE
THUS THEY DIE IN THE OPEN AIR AND BY THE END OF TEN DAYS THEY'VE ROTTED SUFFICIENTLY NEXT THEY'RE IMMERSED IN HUGE TANKS OF SALT WATER THEN THEY'RE OPENED UP AND WASHED AT THIS POINT THE SORTERS BEGIN THEIR TWOFOLD TASK
HAVEN'T CERTAIN FAMOUS PEARLS BEEN QUOTED AT EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES YES MY BOY
THE PEAR SHAPED ONES INTO EARRINGS AND SINCE THEY'RE THE MOST VALUABLE THEY'RE PRICED INDIVIDUALLY THE OTHER PEARLS THAT STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL ARE MORE ERRATICALLY SHAPED AND ARE PRICED BY WEIGHT FINALLY CLASSED IN THE LOWEST ORDER
I KNOW THAT SOME DIVERS CAN LAST UP TO FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS AND HIGHLY SKILLFUL ONES TO EIGHTY SEVEN BUT SUCH MEN ARE RARE
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK IT OVER BEFORE ACCEPTING AS FOR ME I PASSED A HAND OVER MY BROW WHERE BEADS OF COLD SWEAT WERE BUSY FORMING LET'S THINK THIS OVER I SAID TO MYSELF AND LET'S TAKE OUR TIME
ALTHOUGH THESE FISHERIES BELONG TO THE MOST INDUSTRIALIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE ENGLISH
ALL RIGHT SIT DOWN MY FRIENDS
ON THE VALVES A PEARL STICKS FAST ON THE FLESH IT LIES LOOSE BUT ITS NUCLEUS IS ALWAYS SOME SMALL HARD OBJECT SAY A STERILE EGG OR A GRAIN OF SAND
WHO WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY SOON THE NAUTILUS REENTERED ITS LIQUID ELEMENT AND THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED THAT IT WAS STAYING AT A DEPTH OF THIRTY FEET WITH THE CHART UNDER MY EYES
ITS LENGTH IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILES ITS MAXIMUM WIDTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES ITS CIRCUMFERENCE NINE HUNDRED MILES ITS SURFACE AREA TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT SQUARE MILES
BUT ALSO ACCORDING TO THEIR SHAPE THEIR WATER IN OTHER WORDS THEIR COLOR AND THEIR ORIENT IN OTHER WORDS THAT DAPPLED SHIMMERING GLOW THAT MAKES THEM SO DELIGHTFUL TO THE EYE THE FINEST PEARLS ARE CALLED VIRGIN PEARLS OR PARAGONS
I FOUND IT BY THE NINTH PARALLEL OFF THE NORTHWESTERN SHORES OF CEYLON
THAT WOULD DO FOR TO DAY WOULDN'T IT THEN DAY AFTER TO MORROW WE COULD HAVE THE PICNIC AND FOR THE NEXT WEEK I HAVE A MAGNIFICENT IDEA BUT I WANT TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOUR FATHER
LET ALONE BEAUTIFULEST WHAT A DEAR BOY JACK MUST BE
AND I THINK THAT IS A BETTER OMEN STILL HE TOLD MOTHER HE THOUGHT YOU WERE THE BEAUTIFULEST GIRL HE EVER SAW DORA'S EYES OPENED WIDE WITH ASTONISHMENT
IT WAS A TIRED AND HOMESICK LITTLE GIRL THAT MISTER MERRITHEW HELPED OUT OF THE COACH AND LED UP THE STEPS OF HIS HOUSE ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTER OUR STORY OPENS THE JOURNEY FROM MONTREAL HAD BEEN LONG AND LONELY
THAT'LL DO SAID BRETON AT LAST HE DROPPED HIS REVOLVER INTO HIS POCKET AND TURNED TO THE TWO OLD MEN ELPHICK AVERTED HIS EYES AND SANK INTO A CHAIR IN THE DARKEST CORNER OF THE ROOM
WELL ANSWERED BRETON THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A QUANTITY OF PAPERS THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN LOOK VERY ILL AND VERY MISERABLE MYERST IS EVIDENTLY LAYING DOWN THE LAW TO THEM IN SOME FASHION OR OTHER I'VE FORMED A NOTION SPARGO
I HAVE ALWAYS WISHED FOR A REAL FRIEND OR A TWIN SISTER SHE SAID THOUGHTFULLY THE TWIN SISTER IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY AND I HAVE NEVER BEFORE SEEN A GIRL THAT I WANTED FOR A GREAT GREAT FRIEND
GUARDIAN CONTINUED BRETON DON'T BE FRIGHTENED AND DON'T YOU BE FRIGHTENED EITHER MISTER CARDLESTONE THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF JUST YET WHATEVER THERE MAY BE LATER ON IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MISTER SPARGO AND I CAME JUST IN TIME
DORA'S DARK BROWN EYES LOOKED GRAVELY INTO MARJORIE'S BLUE ONES SHE SEEMED TO BE TAKING THE PROPOSITION VERY SERIOUSLY
WHICH HAD BEEN NAMED BY THE NEIGHBOURS WHEN IT WAS THE ONLY BRICK HOUSE ON THE STREET AND THE LARGEST ONE IN TOWN OPENED AND HER AUNT'S MOTHERLY ARMS CLOSED AROUND HER WHILE MARJORIE'S ROSY LAUGHING FACE AND JACKIE'S FAIR CHERUBIC ONE BEAMED ON HER IN GREETING
CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR THE WHIP HAND SPARGO ALMOST IRRITABLE FROM DESIRE TO GET AT CLOSE GRIPS WITH THE OBJECTS OF HIS LONG JOURNEY SHOOK OFF BRETON'S HAND WITH A GROWL OF RESENTMENT
BUT YOU AH YES YOU ARE LIKE MY FATHER AND BESIDES WE ARE COUSINS AND THAT MAKES US UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER LET US BE FRIENDS
THEN MARJORIE'S BRIGHT FACE APPEARED AT THE DOOR AND MAY I COME IN SHE ASKED OH PLEASE DO DORA CRIED KITTY HAS MADE FRIENDS WITH ME ALREADY
SHE HELD OUT HER HAND WITH A LITTLE GESTURE WHICH REMINDED MARJORIE THAT THIS PALE DARK HAIRED COUSIN WAS THE DESCENDANT OF MANY FRENCH GRANDES DAMES SHE CLASPED THE SLENDER HAND WITH HER OWN PLUMP FINGERS
NOW YOU SHALL GET WHERE I DID JUST NOW BEHIND THAT BUSH AND I'LL STATION MYSELF IN THE DOORWAY YOU CAN REPORT TO ME AND WHEN MYERST COMES OUT I'LL COVER HIM COME ON SPARGO IT'S BEGINNING TO GET LIGHT ALREADY
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE I KNOW THAT COTTAGE THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS THIS WE MUST CATCH MYERST UNAWARES HE'S HERE FOR NO GOOD LOOK HERE
ANOTHER GLANCE SHOWED HIM THE FIGURE OF A SECOND BUSINESS LIKE LOOKING YOUNG MAN AT HIS SIDE WHOSE ATTITUDE SHOWED A DESIRE TO GRAPPLE WITH HIM GOOD MORNING MISTER MYERST SAID BRETON WITH COLD AND IRONIC POLITENESS
AND THEY HEARD MYERST'S VOICE THREATENING COMMANDING IN TONE NOW REMEMBER ALL I'VE SAID AND DON'T YOU FORGET I'VE THE WHIP HAND OF BOTH OF YOU THE WHIP HAND
THE PARTING FROM HER PARENTS HARD AND THE THOUGHT OF MEETING THE UNKNOWN RELATIVES HAD WEIGHED UPON HER MIND AND HELPED TO MAKE HER UNUSUALLY SUBDUED BUT WHEN THE DOOR OF THE BIG BRICK HOUSE
AS THEY ARE IN ENGLAND LIVED FOR A TIME
A MOMENT LATER SPARGO WHISPERED AGAIN LOOK OUT BRETON HE'S COMING BRETON DREW BACK INTO THE ANGLE OF THE PORCH SPARGO QUITTED HIS PROTECTING BUSH AND TOOK THE OTHER ANGLE THE DOOR OPENED
THIS VENERABLE DAME HAD BEEN ADDICTED TO THE UNLIMITED EATING OF APPLES AND HER MOTTO SHE WAS NOT A GRAMMATICAL OLD LADY HAD BEEN ACCORDING TO TRADITION APPLES NEVER HURTS NOBODY
AT THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR THE THREE MEN SAT CARDLESTONE'S FACE WAS IN THE SHADOW MYERST HAD HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW OLD ELPHICK BENDING OVER THE TABLE WAS LABORIOUSLY WRITING WITH SHAKING FINGERS
THERE WAS A SMALL BUT WELL ARRANGED MUSEUM OF STUFFED BIRDS AND BEASTS ALL CANADIAN AND MOST OF THEM FROM NEW BRUNSWICK THERE WERE OTHER THINGS TOO TO SEE AND MANY ANECDOTES TO HEAR
THE INTERIOR INTO WHICH HE LOOKED WAS ROUGH AND COMFORTLESS IN THE EXTREME THERE WERE THE BARE ACCESSORIES OF A MOORLAND COTTAGE ROUGH CHAIRS AND TABLES PLASTERED WALLS A FISHING ROD OR TWO PILED IN A CORNER SOME FOOD SET OUT ON A SIDE TABLE
THERE IS ALWAYS ANOTHER LOVELY PLAN JUST AHEAD NO MATTER HOW MANY YOU KNOW ABOUT ALREADY AND MISTER MERRITHEW WHO OVERHEARD THE REMARK THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THIS WAS PART OF THE SECRET OF HIS WIFE'S UNFAILING YOUTHFULNESS
HE TURNED TO OLD ELPHICK GUARDIAN HE SAID
AND HOW ON EARTH CAN I WASTE TIME GUESSING HE EXCLAIMED WHO IS HE BRETON LAUGHED SOFTLY STEADY SPARGO STEADY HE SAID IT'S MYERST THE SAFE DEPOSIT MAN MYERST
HE LIVES IN THAT HOUSE IN MIDDLE TEMPLE LANE YOU KNOW IN THE TOP FLOOR ROOMS ABOVE CARDLESTONE'S AND AND HE SAYS HE'S THE FULLEST EVIDENCE AGAINST CARDLESTONE AND AGAINST ME AS AN ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT AND IT'S A LIE
HE KEPT MYERST COVERED WHILE SPARGO MADE PLAY WITH THE ROPE DON'T BE AFRAID OF HURTING HIM SPARGO HE SAID TIE HIM WELL AND STRONG HE WON'T SHIFT THAT CHAIR IN A HURRY
YES HE MUTTERED BLACKMAIL THAT WAS IT BLACKMAIL HE HE GOT MONEY PAPERS FROM US THEY'RE ON HIM BRETON TURNED ON THE CAPTIVE WITH A LOOK OF CONTEMPT I THOUGHT AS MUCH MISTER MYERST HE SAID
WHAT NOTION MYERST IS IN POSSESSION OF WHATEVER SECRET THEY HAVE AND HE'S FOLLOWED THEM DOWN HERE TO BLACKMAIL THEM THAT'S MY NOTION SPARGO THOUGHT AWHILE PACING UP AND DOWN THE RIVER BANK
AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE THE NEXT MORNING THERE WAS A MERRY DISCUSSION AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE FIRST TO AMUSE DORA JACKIE WHO HAD INVITED HER TO SIT BESIDE HIM AND BEAMED AT HER APPROVINGLY OVER HIS PORRIDGE AND CREAM
ELPHICK BEGAN TO MOVE IN HIS CORNER MUST THE POLICE COME HE SAID MUST THE POLICE MUST COME ANSWERED BRETON FIRMLY GO AHEAD WITH YOUR WIRE SPARGO WHILE I WRITE THIS NOTE
HER SPIRITS BEGAN TO REVIVE THE GREETING WAS SO WARM AND KIND AND THE JOY AT HER COMING SO GENUINE THAT HER FATIGUE SEEMED TURNED AS BY MAGIC TO A PLEASANT RESTFULNESS
IT IS RATHER NICE TO GET GOOD AND HUNGRY JACKIE GRAVELY OBSERVED THAT IS IF YOU HAVE PLENTY IN THE HOUSE TO EAT
SIT DOWN IN THAT CHAIR IT'S THE HEAVIEST THE PLACE AFFORDS INTO IT NOW SPARGO YOU SEE THAT COIL OF ROPE THERE TIE MYERST UP HAND AND FOOT TO THAT CHAIR AND TIE HIM WELL ALL THE KNOTS TO BE DOUBLE SPARGO AND BEHIND HIM
WHEN DORA WAS READY SHE SAT DOWN IN THE LITTLE ARMCHAIR THAT STOOD NEAR A TABLE PILED WITH BOOKS AND LOOKED ABOUT HER CONTENTEDLY THERE WAS AN AIR OF SOLID COMFORT AND COSINESS ABOUT THIS HOUSE THAT RESTED HER
THE BED TO HER GREAT DELIGHT HAD A TOP PIECE AND A CANOPY OF BLUE FLOWERED CHINTZ AND THE LITTLE DRESSING TABLE WAS DRAPED TO MATCH IT JUST OVER THE SIDE OF THE BED WAS A BOOK SHELF QUITE EMPTY
CAME IN AND CARRIED HIM OFF IN HER STALWART ARMS TO HIS LITTLE WHITE BED WHEN HIS MOTHER STOLE UP A LITTLE LATER TO GIVE HIM A FINAL GOOD NIGHT KISS SHE HEARD SUSAN SINGING AND PAUSED AT THE DOOR TO LISTEN
THEN MYERST TURNED AND STEPPED OUT INTO THE GREY LIGHT TO FIND HIMSELF CONFRONTED BY AN ATHLETIC YOUNG MAN WHO HELD THE MUZZLE OF AN UGLY REVOLVER WITHIN TWO INCHES OF THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE AND IN A REMARKABLY FIRM AND STEADY GRIP
I'M GOING TO WRITE A NOTE TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE AT HAWES THERE'S A FARM HALF A MILE FROM HERE WHERE I CAN GET A MAN TO RIDE DOWN TO HAWES WITH THE NOTE NOW IF YOU WANT TO SEND A WIRE TO THE WATCHMAN DRAFT IT OUT AND HE'LL TAKE IT WITH HIM
WHITHER THE LEFT FOLLOWED IT BRETON LAUGHED SOFTLY THAT'S WISE MISTER MYERST HE SAID KEEPING HIS REVOLVER STEADILY POINTED AT HIS PRISONER'S NOSE DISCRETION WILL CERTAINLY BE THE BETTER PART OF YOUR VALOUR ON THIS OCCASION SPARGO
WE WE DIDN'T SEE THAT WE HAD A CHANCE WHAT DOES HE KNOW OF THE MURDER OF MARBURY AND OF YOU IN CONNECTION WITH IT DEMANDED BRETON COME TELL ME THE TRUTH NOW HE'S BEEN INVESTIGATING SO HE SAYS ANSWERED ELPHICK
THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR LATER WHEN BRETON CAME BACK FROM THE FARM HE SAT DOWN AT ELPHICK'S SIDE AND LAID HIS HAND ON THE OLD MAN'S NOW GUARDIAN HE SAID QUIETLY
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING CONSIDERING THAT SPARGO HAD NEVER GONE THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF SEARCHING A MAN BEFORE HE MADE SHARP AND CREDITABLE WORK OF SEEING WHAT THE PRISONER CARRIED
SPARGO STARTED AS IF SOMETHING HAD BITTEN HIM MYERST HE ALMOST SHOUTED MYERST GOOD LORD WHY DID I NEVER THINK OF HIM MYERST THEN I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM SAID BRETON BUT
NOW THE DAY IS OVER WAS ENDED AND THEN A DROWSY VOICE MURMURED NOW SUSAN MY VERY FAVOURITE SONG
SCARCELY LESS ALARMED HAD RISEN AND WAS COMING FORWARD WITH TREMBLING LIMBS WAIT A MOMENT SAID BRETON SOOTHINGLY DON'T ALARM YOURSELF WE'LL DEAL WITH MISTER MYERST HERE FIRST NOW MYERST MY MAN
AND BRETON POINTED SPARGO TO AN OLD CORNER CUPBOARD SPARGO HE SAID I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'LL FIND WHISKY IN THERE GIVE THEM BOTH A STIFF DOSE THEY'VE BROKEN UP NOW GUARDIAN HE CONTINUED
AND SHE NODDED AND SMILED AT THAT GENTLEMAN IN A WAY WHICH MADE HIM ALMOST AS CURIOUS AS THE CHILDREN THAT'S THE WAY WITH MOTHER MARJORIE SAID TO DORA AFTER BREAKFAST SHE NEVER ENDS THINGS UP
AND HER HOMESICKNESS WAS LOST IN THIS BRIGHT HOME ATMOSPHERE MISSUS MERRITHEW TOOK THE LITTLE NEWCOMER TO HER ROOM HAD HER TRUNKS SETTLED CONVENIENTLY AND THEN LEFT HER TO PREPARE FOR THE LATE TEA WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM ALL
RIKA DOM WHICH MEANS RIVER HOUSE AND HAD WRITTEN IN MANY OF HER LETTERS OF THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER ON WHICH IT LOOKED AND THE GNARLED OLD WILLOWS ON THE BANK JUST IN FRONT OF HER WINDOWS THESE WILLOWS SHE HAD OFTEN SKETCHED
AND MAKE HER THOROUGHLY AT HOME IN THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THEN THIS AFTERNOON PERHAPS YOUR FATHER WILL TAKE YOU FOR A WALK AND SHOW DORA THE HOUSE WHERE MISSUS EWING LIVED AND ANY OTHER INTERESTING PLACES
BOTH IN LOOKS AND SPIRITS THE WALK THAT AFTERNOON WAS ONE WHICH DORA ALWAYS REMEMBERED MISTER MERRITHEW HAD AS JACKIE SAID THE SPLENDIDEST WAY OF SPLAINING THINGS
I THINK LIFE WOULD BE VERY DULL WITHOUT MEALS THESE PHILOSOPHICAL REMARKS RATHER ASTONISHED DORA WHO WAS NOT YET ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTRAST BETWEEN JACK'S SAGE REFLECTIONS AND HIS TENDER YEARS
I HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SET OF THEORIES YOU EVER KNEW WHEN I STARTED OUT AS A SCHOOLMA'AM BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS FAILED ME AT SOME PINCH OR ANOTHER EVEN THE THEORY ON CORPORAL PUNISHMENT TEASED MISSUS ALLAN BUT ANNE FLUSHED
THERE IS BUT ONE THING THAT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND I SEE THAT SHE HAS HAD DESIGNS ON CAPTAIN TILNEY WHICH HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAS BEEN ABOUT ALL THIS TIME
PAUL HAD TALKED SO MUCH TO ANNE ABOUT HIS MOTHER AND FATHER THAT SHE FELT AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THEM SHE THOUGHT HIS MOTHER MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIKE WHAT HE WAS HIMSELF IN TEMPERAMENT AND DISPOSITION AND SHE HAD AN IDEA THAT STEPHEN IRVING
AND BOTH KNEW THE WAY TO THAT HAPPY LAND THERE THE ROSE OF JOY BLOOMED IMMORTAL BY DALE AND STREAM CLOUDS NEVER DARKENED THE SUNNY SKY SWEET BELLS NEVER JANGLED OUT OF TUNE AND KINDRED SPIRITS ABOUNDED
ANNE'S HEART SO FAR HARBORED ONLY DREAMS OF FRIENDSHIP AND AMBITION AND MISSUS ALLAN DID NOT WISH TO BRUSH THE BLOOM FROM HER SWEET UNCONSCIOUSNESS
IF WE HAVE FRIENDS WE SHOULD LOOK ONLY FOR THE BEST IN THEM AND GIVE THEM THE BEST THAT IS IN US DON'T YOU THINK THEN FRIENDSHIP WOULD BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD FRIENDSHIP IS VERY BEAUTIFUL SMILED MISSUS ALLAN BUT SOME DAY
DO YOU THINK YOU WILL EVER GET TO COLLEGE OH I DON'T KNOW ANNE LOOKED DREAMILY AFAR TO THE OPAL TINTED HORIZON MARILLA'S EYES WILL NEVER BE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY ARE NOW ALTHOUGH WE ARE SO THANKFUL TO THINK THAT THEY WILL NOT GET
WAS A RATHER RESERVED MAN WITH A DEEP AND TENDER NATURE WHICH HE KEPT HIDDEN SCRUPULOUSLY FROM THE WORLD FATHER'S NOT VERY EASY TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH PAUL HAD SAID ONCE I NEVER GOT REALLY ACQUAINTED WITH HIM UNTIL AFTER MY LITTLE MOTHER DIED
THEY ARE BROAD OR NARROW ACCORDING TO WHAT WE PUT INTO THEM NOT WHAT WE GET OUT LIFE IS RICH AND FULL HERE EVERYWHERE IF WE CAN ONLY LEARN HOW TO OPEN OUR WHOLE HEARTS TO ITS RICHNESS AND FULNESS
SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I JUST CAN'T BEAR IT IT HURTS SO PAUL'S VOICE QUIVERED AND HIS LIP TREMBLED HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS ROSES HOPING THAT HIS TEACHER WOULD NOT NOTICE THE TEARS IN HIS EYES AND YET
AT LEAST TILNEY TOLD ME SO AT THE TIME AND SAID EVERY EYE WAS UPON ME BUT HE IS THE LAST MAN WHOSE WORD I WOULD TAKE I WEAR NOTHING BUT PURPLE NOW I KNOW I LOOK HIDEOUS IN IT BUT NO MATTER
THOUGH IT HAS TURNED OUT SO WELL FOR US I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL AS IT HAPPENS THERE IS NO GREAT HARM DONE BECAUSE I DO NOT THINK ISABELLA HAS ANY HEART TO LOSE BUT SUPPOSE HE HAD MADE HER VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM
IT HAD LOST SOME OF ITS BLOOM AND YOUTHFUL CURVES AND THERE WERE FINE PATIENT LINES ABOUT EYES AND MOUTH A TINY GRAVE IN THAT VERY CEMETERY ACCOUNTED FOR SOME OF THEM AND SOME NEW ONES HAD COME DURING THE RECENT ILLNESS
BUT HE'S SPLENDID WHEN YOU DO GET TO KNOW HIM I LOVE HIM THE BEST IN ALL THE WORLD AND GRANDMA IRVING NEXT AND THEN YOU TEACHER I'D LOVE YOU NEXT TO FATHER IF IT WASN'T MY DUTY TO LOVE GRANDMA IRVING BEST BECAUSE SHE'S DOING SO MUCH FOR ME
HE SEEMED SO UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN HE WENT AWAY WITH A COLD OR SOMETHING THAT AFFECTED HIS SPIRITS I WOULD WRITE TO HIM MYSELF BUT HAVE MISLAID HIS DIRECTION AND AS I HINTED ABOVE AM AFRAID HE TOOK SOMETHING IN MY CONDUCT AMISS
AND THEY PRETENDED TO BE QUITE SURPRISED TO SEE ME OUT I KNEW THEIR SPITE AT ONE TIME THEY COULD NOT BE CIVIL TO ME BUT NOW THEY ARE ALL FRIENDSHIP BUT I AM NOT SUCH A FOOL AS TO BE TAKEN IN BY THEM
I THOUGHT I'D WAIT FOR YOU TEACHER BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO THE GRAVEYARD HE SAID SLIPPING HIS HAND INTO HERS I'M GOING THERE TOO I'M TAKING THIS BOUQUET OF GERANIUMS TO PUT ON GRANDPA IRVING'S GRAVE FOR GRANDMA
NO BUT I THINK SHE SUSPECTS I'M ALMOST SURE SHE WATCHED ME THE LAST TIME I WENT TO THE CAVE I DON'T MIND IF SHE FINDS OUT IT IS ONLY FOR HER SAKE I DON'T WANT HER TO SO THAT HER FEELINGS WON'T BE HURT
FOR YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE SHOULDERS HE HAS BUT SOMETIMES CONCLUDED PAUL WITH A SIGH AND A MEDITATIVE AIR I REALLY THINK PORRIDGE WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME ANNE PERMITTED HERSELF A SMILE SINCE PAUL WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
YOU KNOW TEACHER I WISH SHE WOULD LEAVE THE LAMP IN MY ROOM TILL I GO TO SLEEP THOUGH SHE TAKES IT RIGHT OUT AS SOON AS SHE TUCKS ME UP BECAUSE SHE SAYS I MUSTN'T BE A COWARD I'M NOT SCARED BUT I'D RATHER HAVE THE LIGHT
THE BEGINNING OF VACATION ANNE LOCKED THE SCHOOLHOUSE DOOR ON A STILL YELLOW EVENING WHEN THE WINDS WERE PURRING IN THE SPRUCES AROUND THE PLAYGROUND AND THE SHADOWS WERE LONG AND LAZY BY THE EDGE OF THE WOODS
I WOULD NOT EVEN LOOK AT HIM HE WENT INTO THE PUMP ROOM AFTERWARDS BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE FOLLOWED HIM FOR ALL THE WORLD SUCH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HIM AND YOUR BROTHER PRAY SEND ME SOME NEWS OF THE LATTER I AM QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT HIM
THERE'S NOTHING MEAN ABOUT GRANDMA I CAN TELL YOU EVER SINCE YOU AND I HAD THAT TALK ABOUT PRAYING GOING HOME FROM SUNDAY SCHOOL THAT DAY TEACHER WHEN YOU SAID WE OUGHT TO PRAY ABOUT ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES
FREDERICK COULD NOT BE UNPARDONABLY GUILTY WHILE HENRY MADE HIMSELF SO AGREEABLE
THE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT LAND'S GEOGRAPHY EAST O THE SUN WEST O THE MOON IS PRICELESS LORE NOT TO BE BOUGHT IN ANY MARKET PLACE IT MUST BE THE GIFT OF THE GOOD FAIRIES AT BIRTH AND THE YEARS CAN NEVER DEFACE IT OR TAKE IT AWAY
BUT AM AFRAID YOU NEVER THINK OF ME I WILL NOT SAY ALL THAT I COULD OF THE FAMILY YOU ARE WITH BECAUSE I WOULD NOT BE UNGENEROUS OR SET YOU AGAINST THOSE YOU ESTEEM BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHOM TO TRUST
DOES THE OLDEST TWIN STILL CONTINUE TO BEHAVE HIMSELF HE HAS TO SAID PAUL EMPHATICALLY HE KNOWS I WON'T ASSOCIATE WITH HIM IF HE DOESN'T HE IS REALLY FULL OF WICKEDNESS I THINK AND HAS NORA FOUND OUT ABOUT THE GOLDEN LADY YET
WORSE AND THEN THERE ARE THE TWINS SOMEHOW I DON'T BELIEVE THEIR UNCLE WILL EVER REALLY SEND FOR THEM PERHAPS COLLEGE MAY BE AROUND THE BEND IN THE ROAD BUT I HAVEN'T GOT TO THE BEND YET AND I DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT LEST I MIGHT GROW DISCONTENTED
ANNE PUT ON MATTHEW'S GRAVE THE FLOWERS SHE HAD BROUGHT FOR IT AND THEN WENT OVER TO THE LITTLE POPLAR SHADED CORNER WHERE HESTER GRAY SLEPT EVER SINCE THE DAY OF THE SPRING PICNIC ANNE HAD PUT FLOWERS ON HESTER'S GRAVE WHEN SHE VISITED MATTHEW'S
SHE DROPPED THE KEY INTO HER POCKET WITH A SIGH OF SATISFACTION THE SCHOOL YEAR WAS ENDED SHE HAD BEEN REENGAGED FOR THE NEXT WITH MANY EXPRESSIONS OF SATISFACTION ONLY MISTER HARMON ANDREWS TOLD HER SHE OUGHT TO USE THE STRAP OFTENER
WHO AS YOU MAY REMEMBER WAS AMAZINGLY DISPOSED TO FOLLOW AND TEASE ME BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY AFTERWARDS HE GOT WORSE AND BECAME QUITE MY SHADOW MANY GIRLS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN FOR NEVER WERE SUCH ATTENTIONS
PRAY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO HIS SATISFACTION OR IF HE STILL HARBOURS ANY DOUBT A LINE FROM HIMSELF TO ME OR A CALL AT PUTNEY WHEN NEXT IN TOWN MIGHT SET ALL TO RIGHTS I HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE ROOMS THIS AGE
NOBODY ELSE UNDERSTANDS SO WELL NOT EVEN GRANDMA ALTHOUGH SHE'S SO GOOD TO ME FATHER UNDERSTOOD PRETTY WELL BUT STILL I COULDN'T TALK MUCH TO HIM ABOUT MOTHER BECAUSE IT MADE HIM FEEL SO BAD
THEN SHE PAUSED ABRUPTLY IN THE DELICATE WHITE BROWED FACE BESIDE HER WITH ITS CANDID EYES AND MOBILE FEATURES THERE WAS STILL FAR MORE OF THE CHILD THAN OF THE WOMAN
AND HER DEMANDS IMPUDENT WRITE TO JAMES ON HER BEHALF NO JAMES SHOULD NEVER HEAR ISABELLA'S NAME MENTIONED BY HER AGAIN ON HENRY'S ARRIVAL FROM WOODSTON
SINCE THE EARLIEST MAYFLOWERS ANNE HAD NEVER MISSED HER WEEKLY PILGRIMAGE TO MATTHEW'S GRAVE EVERYONE ELSE IN AVONLEA EXCEPT MARILLA HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN QUIET SHY UNIMPORTANT MATTHEW CUTHBERT
BUT IF SHE IS DETERMINED TO HAVE HER FEELINGS HURT IT CAN'T BE HELPED IF I WERE TO GO TO THE SHORE SOME NIGHT WITH YOU DO YOU THINK I COULD SEE YOUR ROCK PEOPLE TOO PAUL SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY NO I DON'T THINK YOU COULD SEE MY ROCK PEOPLE
LIFE WOULD BE A SORRY BUSINESS WITHOUT THEM WITH THEM IT'S GRAND AND GREAT HOLD FAST TO YOUR IDEALS ANNE I SHALL TRY BUT I HAVE TO LET GO MOST OF MY THEORIES SAID ANNE LAUGHING A LITTLE
FOR YOU ARE DEARER TO ME THAN ANYBODY CAN CONCEIVE I AM QUITE UNEASY ABOUT YOUR DEAR BROTHER NOT HAVING HEARD FROM HIM SINCE HE WENT TO OXFORD AND AM FEARFUL OF SOME MISUNDERSTANDING YOUR KIND OFFICES WILL SET ALL RIGHT
WHEN HE PUT HIS HAND OVER HIS FACE I ALWAYS KNEW IT WAS TIME TO STOP POOR FATHER HE MUST BE DREADFULLY LONESOME WITHOUT ME BUT YOU SEE HE HAS NOBODY BUT A HOUSEKEEPER NOW AND HE THINKS HOUSEKEEPERS ARE NO GOOD TO BRING UP LITTLE BOYS
HOME FOR HIS VACATION TOO I SUPPOSE HOW ARE YOU AND HE GETTING ON WITH YOUR STUDIES PRETTY WELL WE PLAN TO FINISH THE VIRGIL TONIGHT THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY LINES TO DO THEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO STUDY ANY MORE UNTIL SEPTEMBER
THEY ARE VERY INTIMATE AND GO EVERYWHERE TOGETHER BUT GERTIE IS ALWAYS SAYING NASTY THINGS OF JULIA BEHIND HER BACK AND EVERYBODY THINKS SHE IS JEALOUS OF HER BECAUSE SHE IS ALWAYS SO PLEASED WHEN ANYBODY CRITICIZES JULIA I THINK IT IS DESECRATION TO CALL THAT FRIENDSHIP
IT IS BETTER TO POSSESS IT LIVING IN A GARRET THAN TO BE THE INHABITANT OF PALACES WITHOUT IT THE AVONLEA GRAVEYARD WAS AS YET THE GRASS GROWN SOLITUDE IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR VACATION ANNE SHE SAID AS THEY LEFT THE GRAVEYARD ANNE NODDED YES I COULD ROLL THE WORD AS A SWEET MORSEL UNDER MY TONGUE I THINK THE SUMMER IS GOING TO BE LOVELY
THAT IS WHAT HUMILIATES ME WELL WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES DEAR SO JUST PUT IT BEHIND YOU WE SHOULD REGRET OUR MISTAKES AND LEARN FROM THEM BUT NEVER CARRY THEM FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE WITH US THERE GOES GILBERT BLYTHE ON HIS WHEEL
I AM PERSUADED THAT HE NEVER DID AND ONLY MADE BELIEVE TO DO SO FOR MISCHIEF'S SAKE HENRY BOWED HIS ASSENT WELL THEN I MUST SAY THAT I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL
I'VE PRAYED EVERY NIGHT THAT GOD WOULD GIVE ME ENOUGH GRACE TO ENABLE ME TO EAT EVERY BIT OF MY PORRIDGE IN THE MORNINGS
I'LL BE ELEVEN YOU'D NEVER THINK IT TO LOOK AT ME WOULD YOU GRANDMA SAYS I'M VERY SMALL FOR MY AGE AND THAT IT'S ALL BECAUSE I DON'T EAT ENOUGH PORRIDGE I DO MY VERY BEST BUT GRANDMA GIVES SUCH GENEROUS PLATEFULS
BUT WE MUST FIRST SUPPOSE ISABELLA TO HAVE HAD A HEART TO LOSE CONSEQUENTLY TO HAVE BEEN A VERY DIFFERENT CREATURE AND IN THAT CASE SHE WOULD HAVE MET WITH VERY DIFFERENT TREATMENT IT IS VERY RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD STAND BY YOUR BROTHER
AND LOOK TEACHER I'M GOING TO PUT THIS BUNCH OF WHITE ROSES BESIDE GRANDPA'S GRAVE IN MEMORY OF MY LITTLE MOTHER BECAUSE I CAN'T GO TO HER GRAVE TO PUT IT THERE BUT DON'T YOU THINK SHE'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT JUST THE SAME
MY BIRTHDAY IS NEXT WEEK SAID PAUL AS THEY WALKED UP THE LONG RED HILL BASKING IN THE JUNE SUNSHINE AND FATHER WROTE ME THAT HE IS SENDING ME SOMETHING THAT HE THINKS I'LL LIKE BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE COULD SEND
AND THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE IS THAT HAVING A STRONGER HEAD THEY HAVE NOT YET INJURED HIMSELF IF THE EFFECT OF HIS BEHAVIOUR DOES NOT JUSTIFY HIM WITH YOU WE HAD BETTER NOT SEEK AFTER THE CAUSE THEN YOU DO NOT SUPPOSE HE EVER REALLY CARED ABOUT HER
TO BE SURE THE IMPROVERS HAD AN EYE ON IT AND PRISCILLA GRANT HAD READ A PAPER ON CEMETERIES BEFORE THE LAST MEETING OF THE SOCIETY
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING VERY UNEXPECTED LETTER FROM ISABELLA BATH APRIL MY DEAREST CATHERINE
AND WHAT REMAINED OF ALL THINGS KNOWABLE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THROUGH NOVELS PLAYS AND POEMS ABOUT HER FRENCH AND MUSIC THE TWO JUSTIFYING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A YOUNG LADY SHE FELT NO GROUND FOR UNEASINESS
THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
THE ARCHERY CLUB AND INVITATIONS TO DINE WITH THE ARROWPOINTS AS THE HIGHEST LIGHTS IN HER SCENERY WAS NOT A POSITION THAT SEEMED TO OFFER REMARKABLE CHANCES BUT GWENDOLEN'S CONFIDENCE LAY CHIEFLY IN HERSELF
ALWAYS SHE WAS THE PRINCESS IN EXILE WHO IN TIME OF FAMINE WAS TO HAVE HER BREAKFAST ROLL MADE OF THE FINEST BOLTED FLOUR FROM THE SEVEN THIN EARS OF WHEAT AND IN A GENERAL DECAMPMENT WAS TO HAVE HER SILVER FORK KEPT OUT OF THE BAGGAGE
AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
IN WHICH A WOMAN COULD NOT DO WHAT SHE LIKED HAD MORE CHILDREN THAN WERE DESIRABLE WAS CONSEQUENTLY DULL AND BECAME IRREVOCABLY IMMERSED IN HUMDRUM OF COURSE MARRIAGE WAS SOCIAL PROMOTION
WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
HER KNOWLEDGE BEING SUCH AS WITH NO SORT OF STANDING ROOM OR LENGTH OF LEVER COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MOVE THE WORLD SHE MEANT TO DO WHAT WAS PLEASANT TO HERSELF IN A STRIKING MANNER
THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
HOW WAS THIS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE ANSWER MAY SEEM TO LIE QUITE ON THE SURFACE IN HER BEAUTY A CERTAIN UNUSUALNESS ABOUT HER
AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
THAT HAD BEEN BURNE DYNAMICALLY HUMOROUS FUNDAMENTALLY SERIOUS
I'M READING THE FOUR GOSPELS NOW AND THE VARIETIES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE WHAT CHIEFLY STARTED YOU WELLS I GUESS AND TOLSTOI AND A MAN NAMED EDWARD CARPENTER I'VE BEEN READING FOR OVER A YEAR NOW
BUT THIS FAD OF POPULAR PREACHERS RISING ON THEIR TOES IN SIMULATED VIRILITY
IT'S A BAD TIME TO ADMIT IT PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO THINK HE'S ODD HE'S WAY OVER THEIR HEADS
HELLO AMORY HELLO TOM AMORY ROSE EVENING BURNE DON'T MIND IF I SEEM TO RUSH I'M GOING TO RENWICK'S BURNE TURNED TO HIM QUICKLY
BROAD BROWED AND STRONG CHINNED WITH A FINENESS IN THE HONEST GRAY EYES THAT WERE LIKE KERRY'S BURNE WAS A MAN WHO GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPRESSION OF BIGNESS AND SECURITY STUBBORN THAT WAS EVIDENT
NO BURNE I CAN'T GO THAT WELL LET'S WAIVE IT WE WON'T GET ANYWHERE AND BESIDES I HAVEN'T QUITE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT MYSELF NOW HERE'S SOMETHING I DO KNOW PERSONAL APPEARANCE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT COLORING
IN POLITICS AND BUSINESS ONE FOUND HIM AND AMONG THE OLD STATESMEN AND KINGS AND GENERALS
ONE IS ON THE SENIOR COUNCIL AND OF THE DARK HAIRED MEN IT'S ONLY ONE IN FIFTY IT'S TRUE BURNE AGREED THE LIGHT HAIRED MAN IS A HIGHER TYPE GENERALLY SPEAKING
QUITE SUBMERGED IN HIS BROTHER'S PERSONALITY
BURNE HOLIDAY WAS SO EVIDENTLY DEVELOPING
THAN THAT I SHOULD TURN BACK AND I DID GO INTO THEM NOT ONLY FOLLOWED THE ROAD THROUGH THEM BUT WALKED INTO THEM UNTIL I WASN'T FRIGHTENED ANY MORE
BURNE OPENED THE PAPER AND READ HE WHO IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME AS THAT GENTLEMAN SAID WHO WAS NOTORIOUSLY CAPABLE OF ONLY COARSE DISTINCTIONS AND PUERILE GENERALITIES WHAT OF IT FERRENBY BEGAN TO LOOK ALARMED
THE HERO SET OFF IN LIFE ARMED WITH THE BEST WEAPONS AND AVOWEDLY INTENDING TO USE THEM AS SUCH WEAPONS ARE USUALLY USED TO PUSH THEIR POSSESSORS AHEAD AS SELFISHLY AND BLINDLY AS POSSIBLE BUT THE HEROES OF THE QUEST BOOKS DISCOVERED
AND GIGANTIC PADDED SHOULDERS ON THEIR HEADS WERE RAKISH COLLEGE HATS PINNED UP IN FRONT AND SPORTING BRIGHT ORANGE AND BLACK BANDS WHILE FROM THEIR CELLULOID COLLARS BLOSSOMED FLAMING ORANGE TIES THEY WORE BLACK ARM BANDS WITH ORANGE P'S AND CARRIED CANES FLYING PRINCETON PENNANTS
YET THE WORLD IS FULL OF DARK SILENT MEN AND LANGUOROUS BRUNETTES
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM LATELY NO THEN YOU HAVEN'T ANY CONCEPTION OF HIM THE ARGUMENT ENDED NOWHERE
UNABASHED BURNE RAN HIS HAND LOVINGLY ACROSS THE SPACIOUS FOREHEADS AND PILING UP THE PICTURES PUT THEM BACK IN HIS DESK WALKING AT NIGHT WAS ONE OF HIS FAVORITE PURSUITS AND ONE NIGHT HE PERSUADED AMORY TO ACCOMPANY HIM
GOOD LORD TOM YOU USED TO STAND OUT AGAINST PEOPLE SUCCESS HAS COMPLETELY CONVENTIONALIZED YOU TOM GREW RATHER ANNOYED WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO BE EXCESSIVELY HOLY NO NOT LIKE ANYBODY YOU'VE EVER SEEN
BURNE HURRIED ON AND IT WAS SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE AMORY HEARD AN ACCOUNT OF THE ENSUING CONVERSATION BURNE HAD COME INTO THE EDITOR'S SANCTUM DISPLAYING THE PAPER CHEERFULLY HELLO JESSE HELLO THERE SAVONAROLA
YET THINK OF THE PREPONDERANT NUMBER OF BRUNETTES IN THE RACE PEOPLE UNCONSCIOUSLY ADMIT IT SAID AMORY YOU'LL NOTICE A BLOND PERSON IS EXPECTED TO TALK IF A BLOND GIRL DOESN'T TALK WE CALL HER A DOLL IF A LIGHT HAIRED MAN IS SILENT HE'S CONSIDERED STUPID
YES BUT THAT QUOTATION JESSE SAT UP WHAT QUOTATION YOU KNOW HE WHO IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME WELL WHAT ABOUT IT JESSE WAS PUZZLED BUT NOT ALARMED WELL YOU SAY HERE LET ME SEE
OF COURSE I PEOPLED THE WOODS WITH EVERYTHING GHASTLY JUST LIKE YOU DO DON'T YOU I DO AMORY ADMITTED WELL I BEGAN ANALYZING IT
FIRST AND PARTLY BY ACCIDENT THEY STRUCK ON CERTAIN BOOKS A DEFINITE TYPE OF BIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL THAT AMORY CHRISTENED QUEST BOOKS IN THE QUEST BOOK
OH THREE MONTHS AGO AND I ALWAYS STOPPED AT THAT CROSS ROAD WE JUST PASSED THERE WERE THE WOODS LOOMING UP AHEAD JUST AS THEY DO NOW
OH MODERATELY WELL BURNE'S A DAMN GOOD TALKER AND SO OBVIOUSLY SINCERE THAT YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE WITH HIM IT'S SO EVIDENT THAT RESIGNING FROM HIS CLUB MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO HIM THAN PREVENTING IT DOES TO US THAT I FELT FUTILE WHEN I ARGUED
BUT IT DOES REPRESENT SUCCESS HERE IN A GENERAL WAY WELL I SUPPOSE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF EVERY CLASS HERE ARE BLONDS ARE REALLY LIGHT YET TWO THIRDS OF EVERY SENIOR COUNCIL ARE LIGHT WE LOOKED AT PICTURES OF TEN YEARS OF THEM MIND YOU
SHE WAS VOCIFEROUSLY GREETED AND ESCORTED ENTHUSIASTICALLY ACROSS THE CAMPUS FOLLOWED BY HALF A HUNDRED VILLAGE URCHINS TO THE STIFLED LAUGHTER OF HUNDREDS OF ALUMNI AND VISITORS HALF OF WHOM HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS WAS A PRACTICAL JOKE
PROPERTY OF DEAN HOLLISTER BOUGHT AND PAID FOR
BUT THIS IS THE REAL THING ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'LL GO THROUGH FOR PETE'S SAKE TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT WELL BEGAN TOM
THIS TIME IT BEGAN AS PURELY A MENTAL INTEREST
BURNE I DISAGREE WITH YOU ALTOGETHER HOW ABOUT THE SUPERMAN WELL HE'S EVIL I THINK YET HE'S STRONG AND SANE I'VE NEVER MET HIM I'LL BET THOUGH THAT HE'S STUPID OR INSANE I'VE MET HIM OVER AND OVER AND HE'S NEITHER
I'D HAVE COME IN WELL BURNE SAID SUDDENLY AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE WE'RE HALF WAY THROUGH LET'S TURN BACK ON THE RETURN HE LAUNCHED INTO A DISCUSSION OF WILL IT'S THE WHOLE THING HE ASSERTED
THEY TALKED UNTIL THREE FROM BIOLOGY TO ORGANIZED RELIGION AND WHEN AMORY CREPT SHIVERING INTO BED
PLOTTED THE IMPERFECTABILITY OF MAN AND READ SHAW AND CHESTERTON ENOUGH TO KEEP HIS MIND FROM THE EDGES OF DECADENCE
BUT THAT NIGHT AMORY WAS STRUCK BY BURNE'S INTENSE EARNESTNESS A QUALITY HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ASSOCIATE ONLY WITH THE DREAD STUPIDITY AND BY THE GREAT ENTHUSIASM THAT STRUCK DEAD CHORDS IN HIS HEART
AND DEPRESSED HIM THOROUGHLY ASIDE FROM LOATHING PHYLLIS
OLIVER CROMWELL SAID IT DIDN'T HE OR WAS IT WASHINGTON OR ONE OF THE SAINTS GOOD LORD I'VE FORGOTTEN BURNE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER OH JESSE OH GOOD KIND JESSE WHO SAID IT FOR PETE'S SAKE WELL SAID BURNE RECOVERING HIS VOICE
BUT SOMEHOW ARE NEVER ACCUSED OF THE DEARTH AND THE LARGE MOUTH AND BROAD CHIN AND RATHER BIG NOSE UNDOUBTEDLY MAKE THE SUPERIOR FACE I'M NOT SO SURE AMORY WAS ALL FOR CLASSICAL FEATURES OH YES I'LL SHOW YOU AND BURNE PULLED OUT OF HIS DESK
THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU'RE WRONG I'M SURE I'M NOT AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE IN IMPRISONMENT EXCEPT FOR THE INSANE ON THIS POINT AMORY COULD NOT AGREE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT LIFE AND HISTORY WERE RIFE WITH THE STRONG CRIMINAL KEEN BUT OFTEN SELF DELUDING
CAME UNDER THE LASH OF MANY TONGUES UNTIL A FRAILER MAN THAN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SNOWED UNDER DON'T YOU MIND LOSING PRESTIGE ASKED AMORY ONE NIGHT THEY HAD TAKEN TO EXCHANGING CALLS SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK OF COURSE I DON'T WHAT'S PRESTIGE AT BEST
BURNE YOU KNOW YOU'RE SECRETLY MAD ABOUT HER THAT'S THE REAL TROUBLE WHAT CAN YOU DO BURNE WHAT CAN YOU DO AGAINST PHYLLIS BUT BURNE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MUTTERED THREATS WHICH CONSISTED LARGELY OF THE PHRASE SHE'LL SEE SHE'LL SEE
SHE TRIED TO WALK A LITTLE BEHIND BUT THEY STAYED CLOSE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT WHOM SHE WAS WITH TALKING IN LOUD VOICES OF THEIR FRIENDS ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM UNTIL SHE COULD ALMOST HEAR HER ACQUAINTANCES WHISPERING
IT'S THE ONE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL I'VE NEVER MET A MAN WHO LED A ROTTEN LIFE AND DIDN'T HAVE A WEAK WILL HOW ABOUT GREAT CRIMINALS THEY'RE USUALLY INSANE IF NOT THEY'RE WEAK THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A STRONG SANE CRIMINAL
AND WAS EVEN ACCUSED OF BECOMING A SNOB BUT AMORY KNEW IT WAS NOTHING OF THE SORT AND ONCE WHEN BURNE PASSED HIM FOUR FEET OFF ABSOLUTELY UNSEEINGLY HIS MIND A THOUSAND MILES AWAY AMORY ALMOST CHOKED WITH THE ROMANTIC JOY OF WATCHING HIM
NEVER DID THEY SEEM TO HAVE NEW EXPERIENCES IN COMMON FOR TOM AND ALEC HAD BEEN AS BLINDLY BUSY WITH THEIR COMMITTEES AND BOARDS AS AMORY HAD BEEN BLINDLY IDLING
WHAT LIKE THIS MORNING WHAT THE DEVIL
FINALLY TOOK A POSITION THAT WAS BRILLIANTLY NEUTRAL IN FACT
HOW MUCH IT WAS WORTH WHILE BEING A DIPLOMATIC AUTOCRAT AROUND HIS CLUB ON PROSPECT AVENUE AND BASKING IN THE HIGH LIGHTS OF CLASS OFFICE IT WAS DISTINCTLY THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF ARISTOCRACY THAT BURNE FOUND HIS WAY AMORY THROUGH KERRY
HE WROTE THIS EDITORIAL GOING TO FLAY HIM ALIVE
BURNE SEEMED TO BE CLIMBING HEIGHTS WHERE OTHERS WOULD BE FOREVER UNABLE TO GET A FOOTHOLD I TELL YOU AMORY DECLARED TO TOM HE'S THE FIRST CONTEMPORARY I'VE EVER MET
WE'LL GO EAST BURNE SUGGESTED AND DOWN THAT STRING OF ROADS THROUGH THE WOODS DOESN'T SOUND VERY APPEALING TO ME ADMITTED AMORY RELUCTANTLY BUT LET'S GO
SO HE TURNED ON HIS READING LAMP AND TAKING DOWN THE KREUTZER SONATA SEARCHED IT CAREFULLY FOR THE GERMS OF BURNE'S ENTHUSIASM BEING BURNE WAS SUDDENLY SO MUCH REALLER THAN BEING CLEVER YET HE SIGHED HERE WERE OTHER POSSIBLE CLAY FEET
A PETTY CONSUMMATION OF HIMSELF AND LIKE A SOMBRE BACKGROUND LAY THAT INCIDENT OF THE SPRING BEFORE THAT FILLED HALF HIS NIGHTS WITH A DREARY TERROR AND MADE HIM UNABLE TO PRAY
THE YOUNGER PROFESSORS THE ILLITERATE ATHLETES LIKE LANGUEDUC THINK HE'S GETTING ECCENTRIC BUT THEY JUST SAY GOOD OLD BURNE HAS GOT SOME QUEER IDEAS IN HIS HEAD AND PASS ON THE PHARISEE CLASS GEE THEY RIDICULE HIM UNMERCIFULLY
OH NO AMORY PROTESTED HE WORKED TOO HARD FOR THAT I IMAGINE THAT WHEN HE DIED HE WAS A BROKEN DOWN MAN AND THE GREAT SAINTS HAVEN'T BEEN STRONG HALF OF THEM HAVE WELL EVEN GRANTING THAT I DON'T THINK HEALTH HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH GOODNESS OF COURSE
AMORY ASKED EAGERLY YES THAT'S WHAT TOM AND I FIGURED AMORY AGREED
A PHOTOGRAPHIC COLLECTION OF HEAVILY BEARDED SHAGGY CELEBRITIES TOLSTOI WHITMAN CARPENTER AND OTHERS AREN'T THEY WONDERFUL AMORY TRIED POLITELY TO APPRECIATE THEM AND GAVE UP LAUGHINGLY BURNE
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHY I CAN WALK ANYWHERE NOW AND NOT BE AFRAID GO ON AMORY URGED EAGERLY THEY WERE STRIDING TOWARD THE WOODS BURNE'S NERVOUS ENTHUSIASTIC VOICE WARMING TO HIS SUBJECT I USED TO COME OUT HERE ALONE AT NIGHT
HOW ABOUT RELIGION AMORY ASKED HIM DON'T KNOW I'M IN A MUDDLE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS I'VE JUST DISCOVERED THAT I'VE A MIND AND I'M STARTING TO READ READ WHAT EVERYTHING I HAVE TO PICK AND CHOOSE OF COURSE BUT MOSTLY THINGS TO MAKE ME THINK
AND ENTERTAIN SOME HARVARD FRIENDS SHE'LL SEE HE INFORMED A DELEGATION WHO ARRIVED IN HIS ROOM TO JOSH HIM
PHYLLIS HAD PINNED HIM DOWN AND SERVED HIM UP
OF COURSE HEALTH COUNTS A HEALTHY MAN HAS TWICE THE CHANCE OF BEING GOOD HE SAID I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU I DON'T BELIEVE IN MUSCULAR CHRISTIANITY I DO I BELIEVE CHRIST HAD GREAT PHYSICAL VIGOR
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU'RE JUST A RATHER ORIGINAL POLITICIAN HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER THAT'S WHAT FRED SLOANE TOLD ME TO DAY I SUPPOSE I HAVE IT COMING ONE AFTERNOON THEY DIPPED INTO A SUBJECT THAT HAD INTERESTED AMORY FOR A LONG TIME
AND AROUND SMALL TABLES AT THE NASSAU INN
BURNE WAS DRAWING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE WORLD ABOUT HIM HE RESIGNED THE VICE PRESIDENCY OF THE SENIOR CLASS AND TOOK TO READING AND WALKING AS ALMOST HIS ONLY PURSUITS HE VOLUNTARILY ATTENDED GRADUATE LECTURES IN PHILOSOPHY AND BIOLOGY
DID THEIR FRIENDSHIP COMMENCE HEARD THE LATEST SAID TOM
BUT I MEAN THE MASS OF HIS WORK HE'S TREMENDOUS LIKE TOLSTOI THEY BOTH LOOK THINGS IN THE FACE AND SOMEHOW DIFFERENT AS THEY ARE STAND FOR SOMEWHAT THE SAME THINGS YOU HAVE ME STUMPED BURNE AMORY ADMITTED I'VE READ ANNA KARENINA
AND LET IT LOOK OUT AT ME I LET IT PLAY STRAY DOG OR ESCAPED CONVICT OR GHOST AND THEN SAW MYSELF COMING ALONG THE ROAD THAT MADE IT ALL RIGHT AS IT ALWAYS MAKES EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT TO PROJECT YOURSELF COMPLETELY INTO ANOTHER'S PLACE
NEVER ENTERS THE PHILADELPHIAN SOCIETY HE HAS NO FAITH IN THAT ROT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS AND A KIND WORD IN TIME WILL RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THE WORLD MOREOVER HE TAKES A DRINK WHENEVER HE FEELS LIKE IT HE CERTAINLY IS GETTING IN WRONG
SO THERE EXISTS AN INTELLECTUALIST THEORY OF EFFORT WHICH LIKEWISE TENDS TO BRING BACK ALL WILL TO INTELLIGENCE IT IS AGAIN THE SAME AUTHOR THAT TRUE GENIUS W JAMES WHO HAS ATTEMPTED THIS REDUCTION
THUS WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE THINGS ARE IDENTICAL OR DIFFERENT IN AGREEMENT OR OPPOSITION ET CETERA
SAID ZADIG I WAS THE PERSON THAT HAD THE HONOUR OF BEING VICTOR AT YOUR CIRCUS THE WHITE ARMOUR MOST PUISSANT LORDS WAS MINE THAT AWKWARD WARRIOR THERE LORD ITOBAD DRESS'D HIMSELF IN IT WHILST I WAS ASLEEP
OR THE ALMOST UNDEFINABLE ORGANIC TROUBLES REVEALED TO US BY THE SINGING IN THE EARS CONSTRICTION OF THE EPIGASTRIUM THE JERKS THE TREMBLING VERTIGO OR NAUSEA ALL THIS COLLECTION OF ORGANIC TROUBLES
BUT WHAT OTHER INTERNAL ATTRIBUTES OF SUCH AN OBJECT CAN I THINK THAN THOSE WHICH MY INTERNAL SENSE PRESENTS TO ME THAT TO WIT
WHAT IS THE LONGEST AND YET THE SHORTEST THING IN THE WORLD THE MOST SWIFT AND THE MOST SLOW THE MOST DIVISIBLE AND THE MOST EXTENDED THE LEAST VALU'D AND THE MOST REGRETTED
IN AN OBJECT OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING ONLY THAT IS INTERNAL WHICH HAS NO RELATION AS REGARDS ITS EXISTENCE TO ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM ITSELF ON THE OTHER HAND THE INTERNAL DETERMINATIONS OF A SUBSTANTIA PHAENOMENON IN SPACE
ALWAYS SAID THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS MORE EASY THAN TO SOLVE SUCH OBVIOUS QUESTIONS AND THAT HE COULD INTERPRET A THOUSAND OF THEM WITHOUT THE LEAST HESITATION WERE HE INCLIN'D TO TROUBLE HIS HEAD ABOUT SUCH TRIFLES
OUR SENTIMENTS OUR EMOTIONS AND OUR PASSIONS IT IS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED THAT THESE STATES ARE OF A MENTAL NATURE
THE QUEEN AND HE ADOR'D THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE ZADIG PERMITTED MISSOUF THE FAIR COQUET TO MAKE HER CONQUESTS WHERE SHE COULD HE SENT COURIERS TO BRING THE FREE BOOTER ARBOGAD TO COURT
UNDER THE FORM OF TACTILE MUSCULAR THERMAL AND OTHER SENSATIONS UNTIL NOW THIS CATEGORY OF PHENOMENA HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT NEGLECTED BECAUSE WE SAW IN IT EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH THE ROLE IN EMOTION ITSELF SEEMED SLIGHT
SHE COULDN'T CONCEIVE WHY ZADIG SHOULD APPEAR WITHOUT HIS ACCOUTREMENTS NOR IMAGINE WHICH WAY ITOBAD COULD PROCURE THE SNOW WHITE ARMOUR AT THE SIGHT OF ZADIG A CONFUS'D MURMUR RAN THRO THE WHOLE PLACE
FOR IN IT NO ACCOUNT IS TAKEN OF THE FACULTY OF COGNITION TO WHICH THE GIVEN CONCEPTIONS BELONG AND THEY ARE CONSEQUENTLY AS FAR AS REGARDS THEIR ORIGIN TO BE TREATED AS HOMOGENEOUS WHILE TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION
HAPPENED TO DISCOVER ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME
WHICH APPEAR TO US AS PERCEIVED BY US BUT AS BEING OTHER THAN OURSELVES ON THE CONTRARY WE CONSTANTLY AND WITHOUT HESITATION REFER OUR EMOTIONAL STATES TO OUR EGO IT IS I WHO SUFFER WE SAY
AND ORCAN WAS SENTENC'D NOT ONLY TO PAY HIM A VERY CONSIDERABLE SUM FOR THE INJUSTICE DONE HIM IN DETAINING HIS WIFE BUT TO RESIGN HER LIKEWISE TO THE PROPER OWNER THE FISHERMAN HOWEVER GROWN WISE BY EXPERIENCE
THEY PROCEED FROM THE FACT THAT STUDIES ON THE NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS ARE STILL VERY LITTLE ADVANCED THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THESE STATES ARE PRETTY WELL KNOWN AND THEIR PSYCHICAL AND SOCIAL EFFECTS HAVE BEEN ABUNDANTLY DESCRIBED
TOGETHER WITH THE FAIR ALMONZA HIS NEW BRIDE
HE DID NOT DOUBT BUT BEING PROPERLY ACCOUTRED WITH HIS HELMET HIS CUIRASS AND HIS BRACELETS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HUE DOWN AN ANTAGONIST IN HIS MANTLE AND CAP AND NOTHING TO SKREEN HIM FROM HIS RESENTMENT BUT A SINGLE SABRE
AND EVEN INTO OBJECTS SEPARATE FROM OUR BODIES AND WHOSE SOLE RELATION TO US IS THAT OF A LEGAL PROPRIETORSHIP WE MUST GUARD AGAINST THE SOMEWHAT FREQUENT ERROR OF IDENTIFYING THE EGO WITH THE PSYCHICAL
IN A CONCEPTION OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING THE MATTER PRECEDES THE FORM AND FOR THIS REASON
CONCEPTIONS OF COMPARISON CONCEPTUS COMPARATIONIS
IN REGARD TO JUSTICE THE SOVEREIGN GOOD
THEY ANNIHILATE THE EFFECTS OF EACH OTHER AND MAY BE REPRESENTED IN THE FORMULA
WHICH SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT FOR INSTANCE DESIRE REPRESENT A COMPLEMENT OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS
THUS IN THE CASE OF TWO DROPS OF WATER
IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT EMOTION IS NOTHING ELSE THAN A PERCEPTION OF A CERTAIN KIND AN INTELLECTUAL ACT STRICTLY COMPARABLE TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF A LANDSCAPE ONLY IN THE PLACE OF A LANDSCAPE WITH PLACID FEATURES
THE FIRST AND TRADITIONAL ONE CONSISTS IN SEEING IN EMOTION A PHENOMENON SUI GENERIS THIS IS VERY SIMPLE AND LEAVES NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID
OR IT IS THE HEART WHICH HASTENS OR SLACKENS ITS BEATS OR MAKES THEM IRREGULAR OR ENFEEBLES OR AUGMENTS THEM OR THE RESPIRATION WHICH CHANGES ITS RHYTHM OR INCREASES OR IS SUSPENDED
OR THE REFLEX ACTION ON THE CIRCULATION THE PALLOR OR BLUSHING
THE TRANSLATION AND THE DISTANT EFFECTS OF THE EMOTIONS CONSTITUTE THEIR ESSENTIAL BASE THESE EFFECTS ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THE PHYSIOGNOMY THE GESTURE THE CRY AND THE SPEECH
TO ENGAGE WITH THE USURPER OF THE WHITE ARMOUR WITH MY SWORD ONLY IN MY MANTLE AND BONNET AND TO TESTIFY THAT I ONLY WAS THE HAPPY VICTOR OF THE JUSTLY ADMIRED HOTTAM
TO THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OR FACULTIES OF COGNITION BY WHICH ALONE THEIR RELATION TO EACH OTHER CAN BE RIGHTLY DETERMINED THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH OCCURS IN CONSIDERING OUR REPRESENTATIONS IS TO WHAT FACULTY OF COGNITION DO THEY BELONG TO THE UNDERSTANDING
COMPARATIO BUT ONLY BY DISTINGUISHING THE MODE OF COGNITION TO WHICH THEY BELONG IN OTHER WORDS BY MEANS OF TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION WE MAY THEREFORE WITH JUSTICE SAY THAT LOGICAL REFLECTION IS MERE COMPARISON
OR ELSE IT IS THE SECRETION OF THE SALIVA OR OF THE SWEAT WHICH FLOWS IN ABUNDANCE OR DRIES UP OR THE MUSCULAR FORCE WHICH IS INCREASED OR DECAYS
BUT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE IN THIS RESPECT PERFECTLY THE SAME
WHO BY THE BY GAVE IT A PECULIAR FORM BY CAUSING THE PLAY OF IMAGES TO INTERVENE IN THE FORMATION OF THE FEELINGS HOWEVER THIS PARTICULAR POINT IS OF SLIGHT IMPORTANCE
AS WE DO OUR INDIFFERENT SENSATIONS THE SENSATIONS OF WEIGHT
ZADIG'S ANSWERS STILL CARRIED THE GREATEST WEIGHT WHAT PITY TIS SAID SOME WHO WERE PRESENT THAT ONE OF SO COMPREHENSIVE A GENIUS SHOULD MAKE SUCH A SCURVY CAVALIER MOST ILLUSTRIOUS GRANDEES
AND WAS HIS FAVOURITE MINISTER AT COURT AS THE JUST REWARD OF HIS PAST SERVICES HE WAS IN SHORT THE KING'S REAL FRIEND AND ZADIG WAS THE ONLY MONARCH IN THE UNIVERSE THAT COULD BOAST OF SUCH AN ATTENDANT
CONSEQUENTLY AS INTELLIGIBILIA THAT IS OBJECTS OF PURE UNDERSTANDING ALTHOUGH ON ACCOUNT OF THE CONFUSED NATURE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS HE GAVE THEM THE NAME OF PHENOMENA AND IN THIS CASE HIS PRINCIPLE OF THE INDISCERNIBLE
SOFTEN'D THE RIGOUR OF THE SENTENCE AND TOOK THE MONEY ONLY IN FULL OF ALL ACCOUNTS HE DIDN'T LEAVE SO MUCH AS SEMIRA WHOLLY DISCONSOLATE THO SHE HAD SUCH AN AVERSION TO A BLIND EYE NOR AZORA
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE HAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE PARALLELISM OF THE TWO THEORIES BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS EVIDENT EFFORT THAT BASIS OF ACTIVITY THAT STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH SO MANY PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE DESCRIBED AS SOMETHING SUI GENERIS
ON THE OTHER HAND THE REAL IN A PHENOMENON REALITAS PHAENOMENON MAY VERY WELL BE IN MUTUAL OPPOSITION AND WHEN UNITED IN THE SAME SUBJECT THE ONE MAY COMPLETELY OR IN PART ANNIHILATE THE EFFECT OR CONSEQUENCE OF THE OTHER
AND CONSIDERS THEM THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF THE EXTERNAL EXCITANT WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY THIS ELEGANT FORMULA
NOW THE RELATIONS IN WHICH CONCEPTIONS CAN STAND TO EACH OTHER ARE THOSE OF IDENTITY AND DIFFERENCE AGREEMENT AND OPPOSITION OF THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FINALLY OF THE DETERMINABLE AND THE DETERMINING MATTER AND FORM
AND WE ASK OURSELVES WHETHER THIS CLEARNESS OF PERCEPTION IS NOT SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL WHETHER AFFECTIVITY EMOTIVITY TENDENCY WILL ARE REALLY ALL REDUCED TO PERCEPTIONS OR WHETHER THEY ARE NOT RATHER IRREDUCIBLE ELEMENTS
THIS THEORY HAS AT LEAST THE MERIT OF ORIGINALITY IT ALSO PLEASES ONE BY ITS GREAT CLEARNESS
IS LIKEWISE AN INTELLECTUALIST SYSTEM THE DEFINITION OF EMOTION AS IT IS TAUGHT BY W JAMES SEEMS EXPRESSLY MADE FOR US WHO ARE SEEKING TO RESOLVE ALL INTELLECTUAL STATES INTO PHYSICAL IMPRESSIONS ACCOMPANIED BY CONSCIOUSNESS
AND W JAMES AS A PHILOSOPHER THEIR THEORY AT FIRST SIGHT APPEARS SINGULAR LIKE EVERYTHING WHICH RUNS COUNTER TO OUR MENTAL HABITS IT LAYS DOWN THAT THE SYMPTOMS WHICH WE ALL TILL NOW
UPON HIS FORT AS THE SWORDS MEN CALL IT BY WHICH MEANS ITOBAD'S SWORD WAS SNAPT IN TWO WITH THAT ZADIG IN AN INSTANT CLOS'D HIS ADVERSARY AND BY HIS SUPERIOR STRENGTH AS WELL AS SKILL
THESE DERANGEMENTS ARE THE BASIS OF EMOTION ITS PHYSICAL BASIS AND TO BE MOVED IS TO PERCEIVE THEM TAKE AWAY FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THIS PHYSICAL REFLEX AND EMOTION CEASES IT IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT AN IDEA
AND WHEN WE HATE IN ANOTHER BUT THE WHY WOULD REMAIN WITHOUT AN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF KNOWING WHAT PLACE IN OUR METAPHYSICAL THEORY WE OUGHT TO SECURE FOR EMOTION SEEMS DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE
WHICH APPLIES TO THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES CONTAINS THE GROUND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OBJECTIVE COMPARISON OF REPRESENTATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AND IS THEREFORE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE FORMER BECAUSE THE FACULTIES OF COGNITION TO WHICH THEY BELONG ARE NOT EVEN THE SAME
THAT THE WHITE ARMOUR WAS ZADIG'S PROPERTY HE WAS THEREUPON ACKNOWLEDG'D KING OF BABYLON BY THE UNANIMOUS CONTENT OF THE WHOLE COURT BUT MORE PARTICULARLY
FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECTLY OBTAINING CONCEPTIONS OF THEM BUT IS THAT STATE OF THE MIND IN WHICH WE SET OURSELVES TO DISCOVER THE SUBJECTIVE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OBTAIN CONCEPTIONS IT IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE RELATION OF GIVEN REPRESENTATIONS
OF THE EQUIVOCAL NATURE OR AMPHIBOLY OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF REFLECTION FROM THE CONFUSION OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL WITH THE EMPIRICAL USE OF THE UNDERSTANDING REFLECTION REFLEXIO IS NOT OCCUPIED ABOUT OBJECTS THEMSELVES
ARE NOTHING BUT RELATIONS AND IT IS ITSELF NOTHING MORE THAN A COMPLEX OF MERE RELATIONS SUBSTANCE IN SPACE WE ARE COGNIZANT OF ONLY THROUGH FORCES OPERATIVE IN IT EITHER DRAWING OTHERS TOWARDS ITSELF ATTRACTION
THAT THE SENTIMENT LOVE FOR EXAMPLE CORRESPONDS TO A RIGHT HAND SPIRAL MOVEMENT OF THE MOLECULES OF THE BRAIN AND THE SENTIMENT HATRED TO A LEFT HAND SPIRAL MOVEMENT WE SHOULD THEN KNOW THAT WHEN WE LOVE A MOVEMENT IS PRODUCED IN ONE DIRECTION
AND IN THE SAME WAY THAT THERE EXISTS AN INTELLECTUALIST THEORY OF THE EMOTIONS VIZ THAT OF JAMES
IT EXISTS IN ALL DOCTRINES IN WHICH THE CHARACTERISTIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOUGHT AND FEELING IS EXPUNGED AND FEELING IS BROUGHT BACK TO THOUGHT
AND DETERMINE THEIR POSSIBILITY AN OBJECTION PERFECTLY CORRECT IF WE ASSUME THAT WE INTUITE THINGS AS THEY ARE ALTHOUGH WITH CONFUSED REPRESENTATION
ON THAT VERY DAY WHEN THOSE COMBATANTS WHO HAD BEEN BEFORE ENGAG'D IN THE LIST OR CIRCUS WERE ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE SPACIOUS OUTER COURT OF THE PALACE
THO ANOTHER APPEARS CLAD IN MY ARMOUR BUT IN THE MEAN TIME BEFORE I CAN POSSIBLY PROVE MY ASSERTION I INSIST UPON BEING ADMITTED INTO COURT
THAT HE'D MAKE A PUBLICK EXAMPLE OF HIM IF HE FOLLOW'D HIS PROFESSION OF FREE BOOTING FOR THE FUTURE
AND GAVE HIM AN HONOURABLE MILITARY POST IN HIS ARMY WITH A FARTHER PROMISE OF PROMOTION TO THE HIGHEST DIGNITY BUT UPON THIS EXPRESS CONDITION THAT HE WOULD ACT FOR THE FUTURE AS A SOLDIER OF HONOUR BUT ASSUR'D HIM AT THE SAME TIME
I SEIZED THE CUDGEL WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BATTLE AND SWINGING IT WITH ALL THE POWER OF MY EARTHLY ARMS I CRASHED IT FULL UPON THE HEAD OF THE APE CRUSHING HIS SKULL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN EGGSHELL
SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
I BEHELD TARS TARKAS SOLA AND THREE OR FOUR WARRIORS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE CHAMBER AS MY EYES MET THEIRS I WAS FOR THE SECOND TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THEIR ZEALOUSLY GUARDED APPLAUSE
WITH WHICH IT EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO BRAIN ME THE CREATURES WERE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET TALL STANDING ERECT AND HAD LIKE THE GREEN MARTIANS AN INTERMEDIARY SET OF ARMS OR LEGS
AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS THE THING WHICH MORE NEARLY RESEMBLED OUR EARTHLY MEN THAN IT DID THE MARTIANS I HAD SEEN HELD ME PINIONED TO THE GROUND WITH ONE HUGE FOOT
NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN TWO GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS BATTLE WITH NATURE'S WEAPONS AND THE EXHIBITION OF ANIMAL FEROCITY WHICH ENSUED WAS AS FEARFUL A THING AS THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION COULD PICTURE
HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS I TOOK A DOZEN WARRIORS AND HASTENED TO THE DUNGEONS BENEATH THE PALACE THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION
BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
AND STEALTHILY ON CAME THE AWFUL EYES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DEAD BODY AT MY FEET THEN SLOWLY THEY RETREATED BUT THIS TIME WITH A STRANGE GRATING SOUND
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHAINED IN WARHOON IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
AGAINST ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH SHOULD I REMAIN AND FIGHT HOWEVER DESPERATELY IT IS TRUE I HELD THE CUDGEL BUT WHAT COULD I DO WITH IT AGAINST HIS FOUR GREAT ARMS
I WAITED HIS COMING CROUCHING LIKE SOME BEAST OF PREY AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE MY FOOD UPON THE GROUND I SWUNG THE CHAIN ABOVE MY HEAD AND CRASHED THE LINKS WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON HIS SKULL WITHOUT A SOUND
WHILE IT JABBERED AND GESTICULATED AT SOME ANSWERING CREATURE BEHIND ME THIS OTHER WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY ITS MATE SOON CAME TOWARD US BEARING A MIGHTY STONE CUDGEL
FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED
SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS THEIR EYES WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND NON PROTRUDING THEIR EARS WERE HIGH SET BUT MORE LATERALLY LOCATED THAN THOSE OF THE MARTIANS
AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
I DRINK YOUR HEALTH WITH CHEERFULNESS MISSUS MANN AND HE SWALLOWED HALF OF IT AND NOW ABOUT BUSINESS SAID THE BEADLE TAKING OUT A LEATHERN POCKET BOOK THE CHILD THAT WAS HALF BAPTIZED OLIVER TWIST IS NINE YEAR OLD TO DAY
WHEN THERE WAS SOME MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING INQUEST UPON A PARISH CHILD WHO HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED IN TURNING UP A BEDSTEAD OR INADVERTENTLY SCALDED TO DEATH WHEN THERE HAPPENED TO BE A WASHING THOUGH THE LATTER ACCIDENT WAS VERY SCARCE ANYTHING APPROACHING TO A WASHING BEING OF RARE OCCURRENCE IN THE FARM
I HAVE COME OUT MYSELF TO TAKE HIM THERE SO LET ME SEE HIM AT ONCE I'LL FETCH HIM DIRECTLY SAID MISSUS MANN LEAVING THE ROOM FOR THAT PURPOSE OLIVER
IF IF WE CAN WE CERTAINLY CAN BOTH BEING OF FULL AGE AND I HAVE NOT FOLLOWED MY OCCUPATION ALL THESE YEARS WITHOUT HAVING ACCUMULATED MONEY AND IF YOU WILL AGREE TO LIVE IN A TINY COTTAGE SOMEWHERE ON THE HEATH
THEY CANNOT NOBODY DARES TO SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF YOU OR OF ME OH HOW I WISH I WAS SURE OF NEVER LOSING YOU THAT YOU COULD NOT BE ABLE TO DESERT ME ANYHOW CLYM STOOD SILENT A MOMENT
AS THEY WERE EATING THEY SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND THE SOUND OF A BELL THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM AMONG SOME BRAMBLES AND THICK BUSHES THAT WERE CLOSE BY AND THE SAME INSTANT THEY OBSERVED A BEAUTIFUL GOAT SPOTTED ALL OVER BLACK WHITE AND BROWN SPRING OUT OF THE THICKET
MY HEART ALIVE MISTER BUMBLE HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU SURE LY NOW MISTER BUMBLE WAS A FAT MAN AND A CHOLERIC SO INSTEAD OF RESPONDING TO THIS OPEN HEARTED SALUTATION IN A KINDRED SPIRIT HE GAVE THE LITTLE WICKET A TREMENDOUS SHAKE
RETURNED SANCHO PANZA ALL I KNOW IS I WOULD I HAD THE COUNTY AS SOON AS I SHALL KNOW HOW TO GOVERN IT
REPLIED MISSUS MANN AS SHE OPENED A CORNER CUPBOARD AND TOOK DOWN A BOTTLE AND GLASS IT'S GIN I'LL NOT DECEIVE YOU MISTER B IT'S GIN DO YOU GIVE THE CHILDREN DAFFY MISSUS MANN INQUIRED BUMBLE FOLLOWING WITH HIS EYES THE INTERESTING PROCESS OF MIXING
UPON COMING SUDDENLY INTO HAPPINESS HAVE DIED FROM ANXIETY LEST THEY SHOULD NOT LIVE TO ENJOY IT I FELT MYSELF IN THAT WHIMSICAL STATE OF UNEASINESS LATELY BUT I SHALL BE SPARED IT NOW LET US WALK ON
IN THE MINOR VALLEYS BETWEEN THE HILLOCKS WHICH DIVERSIFIED THE CONTOUR OF THE VALE THE FRESH YOUNG FERNS WERE LUXURIANTLY GROWING UP ULTIMATELY TO REACH A HEIGHT OF FIVE OR SIX FEET HE DESCENDED A LITTLE WAY
GOODNESS GRACIOUS IS THAT YOU MISTER BUMBLE SIR SAID MISSUS MANN THRUSTING HER HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW IN WELL AFFECTED ECSTASIES OF JOY SUSAN TAKE OLIVER AND THEM TWO BRATS UPSTAIRS AND WASH EM DIRECTLY
AND NOT STAND HAGGLING OVER TRIFLES BUT WASH MY HANDS AT ONCE OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND ENJOY MY RENTS LIKE A DUKE AND LET THINGS GO THEIR OWN WAY THAT BROTHER SANCHO SAID THE CANON ONLY HOLDS GOOD AS FAR AS THE ENJOYMENT OF THE REVENUE GOES
WHEN A WOMAN ONCE DISLIKES ANOTHER SHE IS MERCILESS O CLYM PLEASE DON'T GO SETTING DOWN AS MY FAULT WHAT IS YOUR OBSTINATE WRONGHEADEDNESS IF YOU WISHED TO CONNECT YOURSELF WITH AN UNWORTHY PERSON WHY DID YOU COME HOME HERE TO DO IT
AND I SHALL BE AS MUCH KING OF MY REALM AS ANY OTHER OF HIS AND BEING SO I SHOULD DO AS I LIKED AND DOING AS I LIKED I SHOULD PLEASE MYSELF AND PLEASING MYSELF I SHOULD BE CONTENT
AND THE MOIST HOLLOWS OF THE HEATH HAD PASSED FROM THEIR BROWN TO THEIR GREEN STAGE YEOBRIGHT WALKED TO THE EDGE OF THE BASIN WHICH EXTENDED DOWN FROM MISTOVER AND RAINBARROW BY THIS TIME HE WAS CALM AND HE LOOKED OVER THE LANDSCAPE
WHICH WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE BEADLE ON THE CHAIR AND THE COCKED HAT ON THE TABLE WILL YOU GO ALONG WITH ME OLIVER SAID MISTER BUMBLE IN A MAJESTIC VOICE OLIVER WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT HE WOULD GO ALONG WITH ANYBODY WITH GREAT READINESS
YOU HAVE COME ONLY TO DISTRESS ME A LONELY WOMAN AND SHORTEN MY DAYS I WISH THAT YOU WOULD BESTOW YOUR PRESENCE WHERE YOU BESTOW YOUR LOVE CLYM SAID HUSKILY YOU ARE MY MOTHER I WILL SAY NO MORE BEYOND THIS
AH BLESS EM THAT I DO DEAR AS IT IS REPLIED THE NURSE I COULDN'T SEE EM SUFFER BEFORE MY VERY EYES YOU KNOW SIR NO SAID MISTER BUMBLE APPROVINGLY NO YOU COULD NOT YOU ARE A HUMANE WOMAN MISSUS MANN
THOUGH I MAY SEEM TO PUT MYSELF FORWARD WITHOUT BEING ASKED I WILL IF IT WILL NOT TIRE YOU GENTLEMEN AND YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR ATTENTION FOR A LITTLE TELL YOU A TRUE STORY WHICH WILL CONFIRM THIS GENTLEMAN'S WORD AND HE POINTED TO THE CURATE AS WELL AS MY OWN
FOR I KNOW ALREADY BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE WOODS BREED MEN OF LEARNING AND SHEPHERDS HARBOUR PHILOSOPHERS AT ALL EVENTS SENOR RETURNED THE GOATHERD THEY SHELTER MEN OF EXPERIENCE AND THAT YOU MAY SEE THE TRUTH OF THIS AND GRASP IT
THEY CALL HIM CAPTAIN BUT ANYBODY IS CAPTAIN HE WAS IN THE ROYAL NAVY NO DOUBT HE HAS BEEN TO SEA IN SOME TUB OR OTHER WHY DOESN'T HE LOOK AFTER HER
AND PROVING HERSELF A VERY GREAT EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHER EVERYBODY KNOWS THE STORY OF ANOTHER EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHER WHO HAD A GREAT THEORY ABOUT A HORSE BEING ABLE TO LIVE WITHOUT EATING AND WHO DEMONSTRATED IT SO WELL
QUITE ENOUGH TO OVERLOAD ITS STOMACH AND MAKE IT UNCOMFORTABLE THE ELDERLY FEMALE WAS A WOMAN OF WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND SHE HAD A VERY ACCURATE PERCEPTION OF WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HERSELF
THAT HE HAD GOT HIS OWN HORSE DOWN TO A STRAW A DAY AND WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE RENDERED HIM A VERY SPIRITED AND RAMPACIOUS ANIMAL ON NOTHING AT ALL IF HE HAD NOT DIED FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS BEFORE HE WAS TO HAVE HAD HIS FIRST COMFORTABLE BAIT OF AIR
KEEP A SCHOOL IN BUDMOUTH AS I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT'S INCREDIBLE THE PLACE IS OVERRUN WITH SCHOOLMASTERS YOU HAVE NO SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS WHAT POSSIBLE CHANCE IS THERE FOR SUCH AS YOU
AND THE NEXT VILKINS I HAVE GOT NAMES READY MADE TO THE END OF THE ALPHABET AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT AGAIN WHEN WE COME TO Z WHY YOU'RE QUITE A LITERARY CHARACTER SIR SAID MISSUS MANN WELL WELL SAID THE BEADLE
AND IF THE MAN IS NOT WELL FILLED OR HIS ALFORJAS WELL STORED THERE HE MAY STAY AS VERY OFTEN HE DOES TURNED INTO A DRIED MUMMY THOU ART IN THE RIGHT OF IT SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE GO WHERE THOU WILT AND EAT ALL THOU CANST
ELSE THOU SHALT NOT BE WORTHY TO SEE THE MIGHTY WONDERS CONTAINED IN THE SEVEN CASTLES OF THE SEVEN FAYS THAT LIE BENEATH THIS BLACK EXPANSE AND THEN THE KNIGHT ALMOST ERE THE AWFUL VOICE HAS CEASED WITHOUT STOPPING TO CONSIDER
WELL WELL MISSUS MANN HE REPLIED IN A CALMER TONE IT MAY BE AS YOU SAY IT MAY BE LEAD THE WAY IN MISSUS MANN FOR I COME ON BUSINESS AND HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
WHO HAD GONE TO THE INN TO FETCH THE SUMPTER MULE HAD RETURNED AND MAKING A CARPET AND THE GREEN GRASS OF THE MEADOW SERVE AS A TABLE THEY SEATED THEMSELVES IN THE SHADE OF SOME TREES AND MADE THEIR REPAST THERE THAT THE CARTER MIGHT NOT BE DEPRIVED OF THE ADVANTAGE OF THE SPOT AS HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID
CLYM TOOK THE HAND WHICH WAS ALREADY BARED FOR HIM IT WAS A FAVOURITE WAY WITH THEM TO WALK BARE HAND IN BARE HAND AND LED HER THROUGH THE FERNS THEY FORMED A VERY COMELY PICTURE OF LOVE AT FULL FLUSH AS THEY WALKED ALONG THE VALLEY THAT LATE AFTERNOON
AND HERE CAPACITY AND SOUND JUDGMENT COME IN AND ABOVE ALL A FIRM DETERMINATION TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH FOR IF THIS BE WANTING IN THE BEGINNING THE MIDDLE AND THE END WILL ALWAYS GO WRONG AND GOD AS COMMONLY AIDS THE HONEST INTENTIONS OF THE SIMPLE AS HE FRUSTRATES THE EVIL DESIGNS OF THE CRAFTY
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ITS OPPRESSIVE HORIZONTALITY WHICH TOO MUCH REMINDED HIM OF THE ARENA OF LIFE IT GAVE HIM A SENSE OF BARE EQUALITY WITH AND NO SUPERIORITY TO A SINGLE LIVING THING UNDER THE SUN
IF THOU WOULDST WIN THE PRIZE THAT LIES HIDDEN BENEATH THESE DUSKY WAVES PROVE THE VALOUR OF THY STOUT HEART AND CAST THYSELF INTO THE MIDST OF ITS DARK BURNING WATERS
INFLAMING HER LEFT EYE WITH THE CORNER OF HER APRON AND NOTWITHSTANDING A OFFERED REWARD OF TEN POUND WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS INCREASED TO TWENTY POUND NOTWITHSTANDING THE MOST SUPERLATIVE AND I MAY SAY SUPERNAT'RAL EXERTIONS ON THE PART OF THIS PARISH SAID BUMBLE
FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE CHILD HAD CONTRIVED TO EXIST UPON THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE PORTION OF THE WEAKEST POSSIBLE FOOD IT DID PERVERSELY HAPPEN IN EIGHT AND A HALF CASES OUT OF TEN EITHER THAT IT SICKENED FROM WANT AND COLD OR FELL INTO THE FIRE FROM NEGLECT
TRUST ME I AM ADVISING YOU NOW TO ACT AS A SENSIBLE MAN SHOULD ONLY READ THEM AND YOU WILL SEE THE PLEASURE YOU WILL DERIVE FROM THEM FOR COME TELL ME CAN THERE BE ANYTHING MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN TO SEE AS IT WERE
HE WAS BROUGHT UP BY HAND THE HUNGRY AND DESTITUTE SITUATION OF THE INFANT ORPHAN WAS DULY REPORTED BY THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES TO THE PARISH AUTHORITIES THE PARISH AUTHORITIES INQUIRED WITH DIGNITY OF THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES
AND A DELIGHTFUL GROVE OF GREEN LEAFY TREES PRESENTS ITSELF TO THE EYES AND CHARMS THE SIGHT WITH ITS VERDURE WHILE THE EAR IS SOOTHED BY THE SWEET UNTUTORED MELODY OF THE COUNTLESS BIRDS OF GAY PLUMAGE THAT FLIT TO AND FRO AMONG THE INTERLACING BRANCHES
ALTHOUGH THIS INVITATION WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A CURTSEY THAT MIGHT HAVE SOFTENED THE HEART OF A CHURCH WARDEN IT BY NO MEANS MOLLIFIED THE BEADLE DO YOU THINK THIS RESPECTFUL OR PROPER CONDUCT MISSUS MANN INQUIRED MISTER BUMBLE GRASPING HIS CANE
SANCHO PARTLY HEARD THESE LAST WORDS OF HIS MASTER AND SAID TO HIM STRIVE HARD YOU SENOR DON QUIXOTE TO GIVE ME THAT COUNTY SO OFTEN PROMISED BY YOU AND SO LONG LOOKED FOR BY ME
HE WAS IN A NEST OF VIVID GREEN THE FERNY VEGETATION ROUND HIM THOUGH SO ABUNDANT WAS QUITE UNIFORM IT WAS A GROVE OF MACHINE MADE FOLIAGE A WORLD OF GREEN TRIANGLES WITH SAW EDGES AND NOT A SINGLE FLOWER
THERE IS NO CHANCE OF GETTING RICH BUT WITH MY SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WHICH IS AS NEW AS IT IS TRUE I SHALL DO A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD TO MY FELLOW CREATURES DREAMS DREAMS
MINGLED WITH FRAGMENTS OF GLITTERING CRYSTAL AND MOCK EMERALDS MAKE UP A WORK OF VARIED ASPECT WHERE ART
THE SUN SLOPING DOWN ON THEIR RIGHT AND THROWING THEIR THIN SPECTRAL SHADOWS TALL AS POPLAR TREES FAR OUT ACROSS THE FURZE AND FERN
THAT THOUGH THE MATERIALS OF WHICH IT IS BUILT ARE NOTHING LESS THAN DIAMONDS CARBUNCLES RUBIES PEARLS GOLD AND EMERALDS
THESE MEETINGS WERE CARRIED ON WITH THE GREATEST SECRECY ONE AFTERNOON HIS MOTHER CAME HOME FROM A MORNING VISIT TO THOMASIN
FOR IF YOU WHO OUGHT TO KEEP AND LEAD THEM GO WANDERING ASTRAY WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEM
WHERE TWENTY OR THIRTY OTHER JUVENILE OFFENDERS AGAINST THE POOR LAWS ROLLED ABOUT THE FLOOR ALL DAY WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE OF TOO MUCH FOOD OR TOO MUCH CLOTHING UNDER THE PARENTAL SUPERINTENDENCE OF AN ELDERLY FEMALE
HERE HE SEES A BROOK WHOSE LIMPID WATERS LIKE LIQUID CRYSTAL RIPPLE OVER FINE SANDS AND WHITE PEBBLES THAT LOOK LIKE SIFTED GOLD AND PUREST PEARLS THERE HE PERCEIVES A CUNNINGLY WROUGHT FOUNTAIN OF MANY COLOURED JASPER AND POLISHED MARBLE HERE ANOTHER OF RUSTIC FASHION
EVIDENTLY GRATIFIED WITH THE COMPLIMENT PERHAPS I MAY BE PERHAPS I MAY BE MISSUS MANN HE FINISHED THE GIN AND WATER AND ADDED OLIVER BEING NOW TOO OLD TO REMAIN HERE THE BOARD HAVE DETERMINED TO HAVE HIM BACK INTO THE HOUSE
AFTER PARTICIPATING WITH HIM IN A SOUND THRASHING HAD BEEN LOCKED UP FOR ATROCIOUSLY PRESUMING TO BE HUNGRY WHEN MISSUS MANN THE GOOD LADY OF THE HOUSE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY STARTLED BY THE APPARITION OF MISTER BUMBLE THE BEADLE STRIVING TO UNDO THE WICKET OF THE GARDEN GATE
FOR BEING A FEMALE AS YOU SAY SHE WILL FOLLOW HER NATURAL INSTINCT IN SPITE OF ALL YOU CAN DO TO PREVENT IT TAKE THIS MORSEL AND DRINK A SUP AND THAT WILL SOOTHE YOUR IRRITATION AND IN THE MEANTIME THE GOAT WILL REST HERSELF AND SO SAYING
I THINK YOU WILL SAID MISSUS MANN WHO HAD NOTICED THE TONE OF THE REFUSAL AND THE GESTURE THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED IT JUST A LEETLE DROP WITH A LITTLE COLD WATER AND A LUMP OF SUGAR MISTER BUMBLE COUGHED
YOU ARE UNNATURAL CLYM AND I DID NOT EXPECT IT VERY LIKELY SAID HE CHEERLESSLY YOU DID NOT KNOW THE MEASURE YOU WERE GOING TO METE ME AND THEREFORE DID NOT KNOW THE MEASURE THAT WOULD BE RETURNED TO YOU AGAIN
AND THAT ARMAND CAN NEVER GIVE YOU HE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS SOUL BUT HE HAS NO FORTUNE CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING YOUR NEEDS AND HE WILL BE BOUND TO LEAVE YOU ONE DAY WHEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE AND WHEN THE DUKE WILL REFUSE TO DO ANY MORE FOR YOU
WHILE GAMBLING GAVE A NEW TURN TO THE FEVER WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PREYED UPON MY HEART AND FIXED IT UPON A PASSION WHICH LAID HOLD ON ME IN SPITE OF MYSELF UNTIL THE HOUR STRUCK WHEN I MIGHT GO TO MY MISTRESS THEN
NO MORE BARRIERS MY MARGUERITE WE LOVE WHAT MATTERS ALL THE REST OH YES I LOVE YOU MY ARMAND SHE MURMURED PUTTING HER TWO ARMS AROUND MY NECK I LOVE YOU AS I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER LOVE
AND WHO HAD NO CONCERN WITH US ALONE WITH NATURE IN THE SPRING TIME OF THE YEAR THAT ANNUAL PARDON AND SHUT OFF FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY I COULD HIDE MY LOVE AND LOVE WITHOUT SHAME OR FEAR
ARMAND ORDER AN OPEN CARRIAGE AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER WE WERE AT WIDOW ARNOULD'S PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE INN WHICH IS A HOTEL ON WEEK DAYS AND A TEA GARDEN ON SUNDAYS
WE BREATHED TOGETHER THAT TRUE LIFE WHICH NEITHER MARGUERITE NOR I HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE HER DELIGHT IN THE SMALLEST THINGS WAS LIKE THAT OF A CHILD THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE RAN IN THE GARDEN LIKE A CHILD OF TEN
FORMERLY WHEN ONE WENT TO FRASCATI ONE HAD THE CHANCE OF MAKING A FORTUNE ONE PLAYED AGAINST MONEY AND IF ONE LOST THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CONSOLATION OF SAYING THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE GAINED WHEREAS NOW EXCEPT IN THE CLUBS
ASKING FOR A NOTE FOR A THOUSAND FRANCS PROFESSEDLY ON BEHALF OF MARGUERITE YOU KNOW I HAD WON SOME MONEY AT GAMBLING I THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY HANDED OVER TO PRUDENCE WHAT SHE ASKED FOR MARGUERITE
THOUGH I WAS HALF INCLINED TO SO MUCH DID I PITY HIM BUT I WAS AFRAID LEST IF I SO ADVISED HER SHE SHOULD THINK THAT I WISHED THE DUKE NOT MERELY TO COME AND SEE HER AGAIN BUT TO TAKE OVER THE EXPENSES OF THE HOUSE
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCEPT IT SAVE FROM ONE MAN LET ME ALONE BIG BABY AND SAY NOTHING THAT MEANS SAID PRUDENCE THAT WHEN I HAVE TWO DAYS FREE I WILL COME AND SPEND THEM WITH YOU
BEYOND DISTINCT IN THE SUNLIGHT RISE LITTLE WHITE HOUSES WITH RED ROOFS AND MANUFACTORIES WHICH AT THAT DISTANCE PUT AN ADMIRABLE FINISH TO THE LANDSCAPE BEYOND THAT PARIS IN THE MIST
IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN LOVE YOU MUST HAVE FELT THE NEED OF ISOLATING FROM THIS WORLD THE BEING IN WHOM YOU WOULD LIVE WHOLLY IT SEEMS AS IF HOWEVER INDIFFERENT SHE MAY BE TO HER SURROUNDINGS THE WOMAN WHOM ONE LOVES LOSES SOMETHING OF HER PERFUME
THE BREEZE THE SHINING SOLITUDE OF FIELDS OR WOODS HOWEVER MUCH ONE LOVES A WOMAN WHATEVER CONFIDENCE ONE MAY HAVE IN HER WHATEVER CERTAINTY HER PAST MAY OFFER US AS TO HER FUTURE ONE IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS JEALOUS
I WILL DO WITHOUT IT BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I DON'T IN THE LEAST KNOW PRUDENCE WAS NO DOUBT GOING TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT I ENTERED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG MYSELF AT MARGUERITE'S FEET
MY EXPENSES WERE VERY MODERATE ONLY I USED UP MY YEAR'S INCOME IN EIGHT MONTHS AND SPENT THE FOUR SUMMER MONTHS WITH MY FATHER WHICH PRACTICALLY GAVE ME TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AND IN ADDITION THE REPUTATION OF A GOOD SON
UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE AWAKENED THE HABIT OR THE NEED OF SEEING ME WHICH MARGUERITE HAD NOW CONTRACTED HAD THIS GOOD RESULT THAT IT FORCED ME TO LEAVE THE GAMING TABLE JUST AT THE MOMENT
AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
FOR THE REST NOT A PENNY OF DEBT THIS THEN WAS MY POSITION WHEN I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MARGUERITE YOU CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY EXPENSES SOON INCREASED
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST AN EXISTENCE
PRUDENCE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO SEEM MADE ON PURPOSE FOR DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER UNCHANGING GOOD HUMOUR AND HER ETERNAL APPETITE SHE NEVER LEFT A DULL MOMENT TO THOSE WHOM SHE WAS WITH AND WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ORDERING EGGS CHERRIES MILK
WELL IT IS ALL SETTLED SHE SAID AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE IS TAKEN ASKED PRUDENCE YES HE AGREED AT ONCE I DID NOT KNOW THE DUKE BUT I FELT ASHAMED OF DECEIVING HIM
SINCE THAT DAY HE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF IN VAIN MARGUERITE DISMISSED HER GUESTS CHANGED HER WAY OF LIFE THE DUKE WAS NOT TO BE HEARD OF I WAS THE GAINER IN SO
THE SUN SHONE UPON MY MISTRESS AS IT MIGHT HAVE SHONE UPON THE PUREST BRIDE WE WALKED TOGETHER IN THOSE CHARMING SPOTS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON PURPOSE TO RECALL THE VERSES OF LAMARTINE OR TO SING THE MELODIES OF SCUDO
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE
ALWAYS REPEATING THAT I WAS QUITE WELL AND THAT I WAS NOT IN NEED OF MONEY TWO THINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD CONSOLE MY FATHER FOR MY DELAY IN PAYING HIM MY ANNUAL VISIT JUST THEN ONE FINE DAY IN SUMMER
AS PRUDENCE HAD TOLD US IT WAS THE REAL COUNTRY AND I MUST ADD IT WAS A REAL LUNCH IT IS NOT ONLY OUT OF GRATITUDE FOR THE HAPPINESS I OWE IT
I CAME TO PARIS STUDIED LAW WAS CALLED TO THE BAR AND LIKE MANY OTHER YOUNG MEN PUT MY DIPLOMA IN MY POCKET AND LET MYSELF DRIFT AS ONE SO EASILY DOES IN PARIS
WHEN AN ADROIT GAMBLER WOULD HAVE LEFT IT SETTLING ONE THING AGAINST ANOTHER I FOUND MYSELF IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS
THE COURTESAN DISAPPEARED LITTLE BY LITTLE I HAD BY ME A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHOM I LOVED AND WHO LOVED ME AND WHO WAS CALLED MARGUERITE THE PAST HAD NO MORE REALITY AND THE FUTURE NO MORE CLOUDS
WE LEFT THE HOUSE AND STARTED ON OUR RETURN TO PARIS TALKING OVER THE NEW PLAN
FAR THAT MY MISTRESS NOW BELONGED TO ME MORE COMPLETELY AND MY DREAM WAS AT LENGTH REALIZED MARGUERITE COULD NOT BE WITHOUT ME NOT CARING WHAT THE RESULT MIGHT BE SHE PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED OUR LIAISON
WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
MARGUERITE WAS NO LONGER THE SAME WOMAN THAT I HAD KNOWN SHE AVOIDED EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT RECALL TO ME THE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LEADING WHEN I FIRST MET HER NEVER DID WIFE OR SISTER SURROUND HUSBAND OR BROTHER WITH SUCH LOVING CARE AS SHE HAD FOR ME
VERY MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY AND NOT POSSESSING THE FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFE THEY LEAD THEY GAMBLE THEN AND WITH THIS RESULT OR ELSE THEY GAIN AND THEN THOSE WHO LOSE SERVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HORSES AND MISTRESSES
AND I WILL SAY GOOD BYE FOREVER TO THE LIFE FOR WHICH I NOW BLUSH YOU WON'T EVER REPROACH ME FOR THE PAST TELL ME TEARS CHOKED MY VOICE I COULD ONLY REPLY BY CLASPING MARGUERITE TO MY HEART WELL
THEN SHE SOMETIMES CAME TO DINE WITH ME ONE MORNING I DID NOT GO TILL EIGHT AND THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I DID NOT GO TILL TWELVE BUT SOONER THAN THE MORAL METAMORPHOSIS A PHYSICAL METAMORPHOSIS CAME ABOUT IN MARGUERITE
ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN US LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE RIVER IN THE CHARMING LITTLE BOAT WHICH I HAD BOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WEARING A STRAW HAT
PRUDENCE ON HER SIDE BROUGHT DOWN ALL THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW AND DID THE HONOURS OF THE HOUSE AS IF THE HOUSE BELONGED TO HER THE DUKE'S MONEY PAID FOR ALL THAT AS YOU MAY IMAGINE BUT FROM TIME TO TIME PRUDENCE CAME TO ME
AND WHEN SHALL YOU MOVE INTO THE HOUSE INQUIRED PRUDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WILL YOU TAKE YOUR HORSES AND CARRIAGE I SHALL TAKE THE WHOLE HOUSE AND YOU CAN LOOK AFTER MY PLACE WHILE I AM AWAY
AND FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN I POSSESSED I BORROWED AT PARIS A SUM EQUAL TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY BORROWED AND PAID BACK I WAS THEN ONCE MORE IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT RECKONING MY ALLOWANCE
BY DAY IN THE LITTLE WOOD THAT COVERED THE HILLSIDE IN THE EVENING SEATED ON THE GRASS AND I ASKED MYSELF IF EARTHLY CREATURES HAD EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS WE SHOULD BE WHAT A PRETTY HOUSE MARGUERITE SAID TO ME
AND ALL THE SIMPLICITY OF ITS DEVELOPMENTS I REALIZED THEN THAT AS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD MAKE ME FORGET MY MISTRESS IT WAS NEEDFUL FOR ME TO FIND SOME WAY OF MEETING THE EXPENSES INTO WHICH SHE DREW ME THEN TOO
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SHE READ MANON LESCAUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I FOUND HER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING NOTES IN THE BOOK AND SHE ALWAYS DECLARED THAT WHEN A WOMAN LOVES SHE CAN NOT DO AS MANON DID
I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THIS RAPID NOISY AND VOLCANIC LIFE WHICH HAD FORMERLY TERRIFIED ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AND WHICH HAD BECOME FOR ME THE NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF MY LOVE FOR MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE DONE
I HAD TAKEN HER CURE IN HAND AND THE POOR GIRL SEEING MY AIM OBEYED ME IN ORDER TO PROVE HER GRATITUDE I HAD SUCCEEDED WITHOUT EFFORT OR TROUBLE IN ALMOST ISOLATING HER FROM HER FORMER HABITS MY DOCTOR
WHICH IS VERY DISAGREEABLE DEBTS ARE CONTRACTED ACQUAINTANCES BEGUN ABOUT A GREEN TABLE END BY QUARRELS IN WHICH LIFE OR HONOUR COMES TO GRIEF AND THOUGH ONE MAY BE AN HONEST MAN ONE FINDS ONESELF RUINED BY VERY HONEST MEN
I LOST ONLY WHAT I WAS ABLE TO PAY AND GAINED ONLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOSE FOR THE REST CHANCE WAS ON MY SIDE I MADE NO DEBTS AND I SPENT THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS WHEN I DID NOT GAMBLE
THE NIGHTS THAT I DID NOT SPEND IN THE RUE D'ANTIN IF I HAD SPENT THEM ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM I COULD NOT HAVE SLEPT JEALOUSY WOULD HAVE KEPT ME AWAKE AND INFLAMED MY BLOOD AND MY THOUGHTS
AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
I TOOK IT WAS I RIGHT I FLUNG MY ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND KISSED HER IT WILL BE CHARMING SHE CONTINUED YOU HAVE THE KEY OF THE LITTLE DOOR AND I HAVE PROMISED THE DUKE THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR
MARGUERITE GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS NEW EXISTENCE WHOSE SALUTARY EFFECTS SHE ALREADY REALIZED SHE BEGAN TO SPEND SOME OF HER EVENINGS AT HOME OR IF THE WEATHER WAS FINE SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A SHAWL PUT ON A VEIL AND WE WENT ON FOOT
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL HER AND I HAD LISTENED AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM INTO WHICH THEY HAD SHUT THEMSELVES NOT LONG AFTER PRUDENCE RETURNED AGAIN I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND SHE DID NOT SEE ME
NOTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE AS THEIR CAPRICES FLOWERS BOXES AT THE THEATRE SUPPERS DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH ONE CAN NEVER REFUSE TO ONE'S MISTRESS AS I HAVE TOLD YOU I HAD LITTLE MONEY
IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD BECOME A MILLIONAIRE WHAT HAPPENED TO LAMP WICK MY DEAR CHILDREN I DO NOT KNOW PINOCCHIO I CAN TELL YOU MET WITH GREAT HARDSHIPS EVEN FROM THE FIRST DAY
WHERE THE RAINBOW TOUCHED THE EARTH AND THE RAINBOW WAS A GREAT BRIDGE BUILT OF LIVING COLOURS SO DAZZLING AND WONDERFUL THAT BEYOND IT THE EYE COULD SEE NOTHING ONLY FAR AWAY A GREAT BLINDING SPARKLING GLORY
AND EAGER AS SHE HAD LONG BEEN TO QUIT IT COULD NOT WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT BID ADIEU TO THE HOUSE IN WHICH SHE HAD FOR THE LAST TIME ENJOYED THOSE HOPES AND THAT CONFIDENCE IN WILLOUGHBY WHICH WERE NOW EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER WITHOUT GREAT PAIN
A GREAT SASH OF GOLD AND SILVER WAS FASTENED AROUND HIS WAIST AND HIS TAIL WAS DECORATED WITH RIBBONS OF MANY BRILLIANT COLORS HE WAS A HANDSOME DONKEY INDEED THE MANAGER WHEN INTRODUCING HIM TO THE PUBLIC
A SHOWER OF APPLAUSE GREETED THE DONKEY AS HE AROSE TO HIS FEET CRIES AND SHOUTS AND HANDCLAPPINGS WERE HEARD ON ALL SIDES AT ALL THAT NOISE PINOCCHIO LIFTED HIS HEAD AND RAISED HIS EYES
AND NEEDLESS ALARM OF A LOVER TWO DELIGHTFUL TWILIGHT WALKS ON THE THIRD AND FOURTH EVENINGS OF HER BEING THERE NOT MERELY ON THE DRY GRAVEL OF THE SHRUBBERY BUT ALL OVER THE GROUNDS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MOST DISTANT PARTS OF THEM
CECILY AND FELIX WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD DISTINGUISH THE DOUBLE STAR IN THE HANDLE OF THE BIG DIPPER AND GREATLY DID THEY PLUME THEMSELVES THEREON THE STORY GIRL TOLD US THE MYTHS AND LEGENDS WOVEN AROUND THESE IMMEMORIAL CLUSTERS
SHE RETURNED JUST IN TIME TO JOIN THE OTHERS AS THEY QUITTED THE HOUSE ON AN EXCURSION THROUGH ITS MORE IMMEDIATE PREMISES AND THE REST OF THE MORNING WAS EASILY WHILED AWAY IN LOUNGING ROUND THE KITCHEN GARDEN EXAMINING THE BLOOM UPON ITS WALLS
THE DAY CAME AT LAST WHEN PINOCCHIO'S MASTER WAS ABLE TO ANNOUNCE AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE THE ANNOUNCEMENTS POSTED ALL AROUND THE TOWN AND WRITTEN IN LARGE LETTERS READ THUS
MOST HONORED FRIENDS GENTLEMEN AND LADIES YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT THE MANAGER OF THIS THEATER PRESENTS HIMSELF BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IN ORDER TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE GREATEST
AND LIKE EVERY OTHER PLACE OF THE SAME DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE IT HAD ITS OPEN SHRUBBERY AND CLOSER WOOD WALK A ROAD OF SMOOTH GRAVEL WINDING ROUND A PLANTATION LED TO THE FRONT THE LAWN WAS DOTTED OVER WITH TIMBER THE HOUSE ITSELF WAS UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE FIR
AND HE WEPT BITTERLY NO ONE KNEW IT HOWEVER LEAST OF ALL THE MANAGER WHO CRACKING HIS WHIP CRIED OUT BRAVO PINOCCHIO NOW SHOW US HOW GRACEFULLY YOU CAN JUMP THROUGH THE RINGS
TO REST WITH COMPLACENCY ON THE REMEMBRANCE OF EDWARD'S GENEROUS TEMPER SIMPLE TASTE AND DIFFIDENT FEELINGS OF EDWARD OR AT LEAST OF SOME OF HIS CONCERNS SHE NOW RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE FROM COLONEL BRANDON
OCTOBER WAS A BUSY MONTH ON THE HILL FARMS THE APPLES HAD TO BE PICKED AND THIS WORK FELL MAINLY TO US CHILDREN WE STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL TO DO IT IT WAS PLEASANT WORK AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FUN IN IT
AS SOON AS THE BUYER HAD PAID THE FOUR CENTS THE DONKEY CHANGED HANDS HIS NEW OWNER TOOK HIM TO A HIGH CLIFF OVERLOOKING THE SEA PUT A STONE AROUND HIS NECK TIED A ROPE TO ONE OF HIS HIND FEET GAVE HIM A PUSH
ODIN WAS THE GREAT GOD OF THE NORTHLAND YOU KNOW AND WHEREVER HE WENT AMONG MEN HE TAUGHT THEM LOVE AND BROTHERHOOD AND SKILFUL ARTS
CHAPTER THIRTY THREE PINOCCHIO HAVING BECOME A DONKEY IS BOUGHT BY THE OWNER OF A CIRCUS WHO WANTS TO TEACH HIM TO DO TRICKS THE DONKEY BECOMES LAME AND IS SOLD TO A MAN WHO WANTS TO USE HIS SKIN FOR A DRUMHEAD
AND AS HE DID THERE CAME RUSHING OVER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE A GREAT COMPANY THE BAND OF FELLOW TRAVELLERS BUT ALL WERE TOO LATE TO WIN THE DOUBLE BOON VING HAD WON TO IT THROUGH THE DANGER AND SUFFERING OF THE DARK RIVER
AS IF THE GOLD AND FLAME OF HER SPIRIT HAD BROKEN OUT IN A CORONAL AS MUCH A PART OF HER AS THE PALE HALO SEEMS A PART OF THE MADONNA IT ENCIRCLES WHAT TALES SHE TOLD US ON THOSE FAR AWAY AUTUMN DAYS
IN ORDER TO BRING HIM TO MY WILL WITH ALL MY KINDNESS HOWEVER I NEVER SUCCEEDED IN GAINING MY DONKEY'S LOVE HE IS STILL TODAY AS SAVAGE AS THE DAY I FOUND HIM HE STILL FEARS AND HATES ME
THE GREAT SQUARE OF PEGASUS WAS OVER OUR HEADS CASSIOPEIA SAT ENTHRONED IN HER BEAUTIFUL CHAIR IN THE NORTH EAST AND NORTH OF US THE DIPPERS SWUNG UNTIRINGLY AROUND THE POLE STAR
FORD THAT FLOOD ON THE FURTHEST BANK IS THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE THOU MOCKEST ME MUTTERED VING SULLENLY NO MORTAL COULD CROSS THAT FLOOD OH MASTER HE PRAYED TURNING BESEECHINGLY TO ODIN
IT AMUSED HER TO OBSERVE THAT ALL HER FRIENDS SEEMED DETERMINED TO SEND HER TO DELAFORD A PLACE IN WHICH OF ALL OTHERS SHE WOULD NOW LEAST CHUSE TO VISIT OR WISH TO RESIDE
THAT BEAUTIFUL LADY IS MY FAIRY SAID PINOCCHIO TO HIMSELF RECOGNIZING HER HE FELT SO HAPPY THAT HE TRIED HIS BEST TO CRY OUT OH MY FAIRY MY OWN FAIRY
WHEN THE FIRST PART OF THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER THE OWNER AND MANAGER OF THE CIRCUS IN A BLACK COAT WHITE KNEE BREECHES AND PATENT LEATHER BOOTS PRESENTED HIMSELF TO THE PUBLIC AND IN A LOUD POMPOUS VOICE MADE THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT
THE MORNING WAS FINE AND DRY AND MARIANNE IN HER PLAN OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD HAD NOT CALCULATED FOR ANY CHANGE OF WEATHER DURING THEIR STAY AT CLEVELAND WITH GREAT SURPRISE THEREFORE
BUT AT LAST HE WON THROUGH TO THE FURTHEST SIDE BREATHLESS AND REELING HIS VESTURE TORN HIS GREAT WOUNDS BLEEDING HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE SHORE WHERE THE FOUNTAIN OF IMMORTALITY SPRANG UP
SHE LIKED HIM HOWEVER UPON THE WHOLE MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND IN HER HEART WAS NOT SORRY THAT SHE COULD LIKE HIM NO MORE NOT SORRY TO BE DRIVEN BY THE OBSERVATION OF HIS EPICURISM HIS SELFISHNESS AND HIS CONCEIT
THEN IN ORDER TO TEACH THE DONKEY THAT IT WAS NOT GOOD MANNERS TO BRAY BEFORE THE PUBLIC THE MANAGER HIT HIM ON THE NOSE WITH THE HANDLE OF THE WHIP THE POOR LITTLE DONKEY STUCK OUT A LONG TONGUE AND LICKED HIS NOSE FOR A LONG TIME
JUST THINK HOW DREADFUL IT WOULD BE IF OUR FATHER HAD LEFT US LIKE THAT OUR FATHER IS A KING SAID FELICITY LOFTILY AND PETER'S FATHER WAS ONLY A CRAIG A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY COULDN'T BEHAVE LIKE THAT
TALL AND STRAIGHT WAS HE AS A YOUNG PINE AND HIS LONG HAIR WAS THE COLOUR OF RIPE WHEAT IN THE SUN AND HIS BLUE EYES WERE LIKE THE NORTHLAND HEAVENS ON A STARRY NIGHT IN ODIN'S BAND WAS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN NAMED ALIN
WELL WHAT IS THE REASON ASKED FELICITY BECAUSE THERE'S MORE OF THEM SAID FELIX GRINNING I FORGET WHAT WE DID TO FELIX
AND WHILE HIS LOOKS OF ANXIOUS SOLICITUDE ON MARIANNE'S FEELING IN HER HEAD AND THROAT THE BEGINNING OF A HEAVY COLD BECAUSE UNEXPRESSED BY WORDS ENTIRELY ESCAPED THE LATTER LADY'S OBSERVATION SHE COULD DISCOVER IN THEM THE QUICK FEELINGS
WE WERE ALL OF US TOO TIRED THOSE NIGHTS TO DO ANY SPECIAL PRAYING SOMETIMES I FEAR OUR REGULAR PRAYERS WERE SLURRED OVER OR MUMBLED IN ANYTHING BUT REVERENT HASTE
STEALING AWAY THROUGH THE WINDING SHRUBBERIES NOW JUST BEGINNING TO BE IN BEAUTY TO GAIN A DISTANT EMINENCE WHERE FROM ITS GRECIAN TEMPLE HER EYE WANDERING OVER A WIDE TRACT OF COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH EAST
HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE AVOIDED BY THE FAMILY IN GENERAL SOON PROCURED HERSELF A BOOK NOTHING WAS WANTING ON MISSUS PALMER'S SIDE THAT CONSTANT AND FRIENDLY GOOD HUMOUR COULD DO TO MAKE THEM FEEL THEMSELVES WELCOME
THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU HERE ONLY TO GIVE YOU FOOD AND DRINK OH NO YOU ARE TO HELP ME EARN SOME FINE GOLD PIECES DO YOU HEAR COME ALONG NOW I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU TO JUMP AND BOW
AND CONFIRMING HER OWN THEIR JOURNEY WAS SAFELY PERFORMED THE SECOND DAY BROUGHT THEM INTO THE CHERISHED OR THE PROHIBITED COUNTY OF SOMERSET FOR AS SUCH WAS IT DWELT ON BY TURNS IN MARIANNE'S IMAGINATION
THE MOUNTAIN ASH AND THE ACACIA AND A THICK SCREEN OF THEM ALTOGETHER INTERSPERSED WITH TALL LOMBARDY POPLARS SHUT OUT THE OFFICES MARIANNE ENTERED THE HOUSE WITH A HEART SWELLING WITH EMOTION
AND HIS DEFERENCE FOR HER OPINION MIGHT VERY WELL JUSTIFY MISSUS JENNINGS'S PERSUASION OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH PERHAPS HAD NOT ELINOR STILL AS FROM THE FIRST BELIEVED MARIANNE HIS REAL FAVOURITE TO MAKE HER SUSPECT IT HERSELF
AFTER PUTTING HIM IN A STABLE HIS NEW MASTER FILLED HIS MANGER WITH STRAW BUT PINOCCHIO AFTER TASTING A MOUTHFUL SPAT IT OUT THEN THE MAN FILLED THE MANGER WITH HAY
BUT AS IT WAS SUCH A NOTION HAD SCARCELY EVER ENTERED HER HEAD EXCEPT BY MISSUS JENNINGS'S SUGGESTION AND SHE COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING HERSELF THE NICEST OBSERVER OF THE TWO SHE WATCHED HIS EYES WHILE MISSUS JENNINGS THOUGHT ONLY OF HIS BEHAVIOUR
AND HE PLUNGED FIERCELY IN HE SWAM AND STRUGGLED HE BUFFETTED THE TURMOIL THE WAVES WENT OVER HIS HEAD AGAIN AND AGAIN THE WHIRLPOOLS CAUGHT HIM AND FLUNG HIM ON THE CRUEL ROCKS
NOR COULD SHE LEAVE THE PLACE IN WHICH WILLOUGHBY REMAINED BUSY IN NEW ENGAGEMENTS AND NEW SCHEMES IN WHICH SHE COULD HAVE NO SHARE
AND TOLERABLY EARLY IN THE DAY THE TWO PARTIES FROM HANOVER SQUARE AND BERKELEY STREET SET OUT FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES TO MEET BY APPOINTMENT ON THE ROAD FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF CHARLOTTE AND HER CHILD
FINALLY NOT FINDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THE MANGER HE TASTED THE HAY AFTER TASTING IT HE CHEWED IT WELL CLOSED HIS EYES AND SWALLOWED IT THIS HAY IS NOT BAD HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THOSE TWO GIRLS WERE OF A DOMESTIC TYPE THAT ASSORTED ILL WITH THE WILDFIRE IN NATURE'S VEINS BUT WHEN THE STORY GIRL WREATHED HER NUT BROWN TRESSES WITH CRIMSON LEAVES IT SEEMED AS PETER SAID THAT THEY GREW ON HER
STRONG NOBLE AND VALIANT HE SAID RAINBOW BRIDGE IS NOT FOR THEE VERY DARK GREW VING'S FACE HOT REBELLION ROSE IN HIS HEART AND RUSHED OVER HIS PALE LIPS
AND THAT ALL OUR OLD FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS WERE MOMENTARILY FORGOTTEN AND STRANGE THAT NIGHT WHEN HE POINTED OUT THE STARS TO US FROM THE PULPIT STONE WAS THE LAST TIME FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THAT PETER SHARED OUR TOIL AND PASTIME
THAT THEY MIGHT DRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE BEYOND AND THE WARDER SET OPEN THE GATE PASS ON AND DRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN HE SAID TO ALL WHO TASTE OF IT SHALL IMMORTALITY BE GIVEN
AND IN VISITING HER POULTRY YARD WHERE IN THE DISAPPOINTED HOPES OF HER DAIRY MAID BY HENS FORSAKING THEIR NESTS OR BEING STOLEN BY A FOX OR IN THE RAPID DECREASE OF A PROMISING YOUNG BROOD SHE FOUND FRESH SOURCES OF MERRIMENT
ADMIRE HIM O SIGNORI AND ENJOY YOURSELVES I LET YOU NOW BE THE JUDGES OF MY SUCCESS AS A TEACHER OF ANIMALS BEFORE I LEAVE YOU I WISH TO STATE THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER PERFORMANCE TOMORROW NIGHT
AND HE STARTED TO YAWN FROM HUNGER AS HE YAWNED HE OPENED A MOUTH AS
BUT INSTEAD OF WORDS A LOUD BRAYING WAS HEARD IN THE THEATER SO LOUD AND SO LONG THAT ALL THE SPECTATORS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN BUT ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN BURST OUT LAUGHING
THOU MAYEST RETURN TO EARTH IF THOU FEAREST TO ESSAY THE FLOOD SAID THE WARDER NAY SAID VING WILDLY EARTHLY LIFE WITHOUT ALIN IS MORE DREADFUL THAN THE DEATH WHICH AWAITS ME IN YON DARK RIVER
IN THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP FINE SAMPLES OF ALGAE IN PARTICULAR CERTAIN FUCUS PLANTS WHOSE ROOTS WERE LADEN WITH THE WORLD'S BEST MUSSELS
WORKING HIMSELF CAPTAIN NEMO PASSED NEAR ME JUST THEN I TOUCHED HIM WITH MY HAND AND POINTED TO THE WALLS OF OUR PRISON THE STARBOARD WALL HAD MOVED FORWARD TO A POINT LESS THAN FOUR METERS FROM THE NAUTILUS'S HULL
THE BOAT SANK AND WAS FITTED INTO ITS SOCKET JUST THEN THE WHOLE CREW RETURNED ON BOARD AND THE DOUBLE OUTSIDE DOOR WAS CLOSED BY THIS POINT THE NAUTILUS WAS RESTING ON A BED OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK
I SQUEEZED IT IN AN INVOLUNTARY CONVULSION ALL AT ONCE CARRIED AWAY BY ITS FRIGHTFUL EXCESS LOAD THE NAUTILUS SANK INTO THE WATERS LIKE A CANNONBALL IN OTHER WORDS DROPPING AS IF IN A VACUUM
AND THE NAUTILUS'S ATMOSPHERE WHICH WAS ALREADY CHARGED WITH CARBON DIOXIDE THE AIR HADN'T BEEN RENEWED IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND ITS LIFE GIVING QUALITIES WERE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED MEANWHILE
A TORTURE UNDREAMED OF BY EVEN THE WILDEST SAVAGES I FELT LIKE I WAS LYING IN THE JAWS OF A FEARSOME MONSTER JAWS IRRESISTIBLY CLOSING SUPERVISING OUR WORK
IS DEATH BY CRUSHING THE SECOND IS DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION I DON'T MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH BY STARVATION BECAUSE THE NAUTILUS'S PROVISIONS WILL CERTAINLY LAST LONGER THAN WE WILL
BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE METERS AND WENT ALONG THE SOUTH AMERICAN COAST
WE'LL NEVER REGRET HAVING KNOWN HIM ESPECIALLY ONCE WE'VE LEFT HIM NED LAND SHOT BACK THE NEXT DAY
WHEN THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES BEFORE NOON WE RAISED LAND TO THE WEST
BY THEN ALL OUR PAST SUFFERINGS WERE FORGOTTEN THE MEMORY OF THAT IMPRISONMENT UNDER THE ICE FADED FROM OUR MINDS WE HAD THOUGHTS ONLY OF THE FUTURE
HISSING SOUNDS SOON TOLD ME THAT WATER WAS BEING ADMITTED INTO THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS SLOWLY SETTLED AND RESTED ON THE ICY BOTTOM AT A DEPTH OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY METERS THE DEPTH AT WHICH THE LOWER SHELF OF ICE LAY SUBMERGED
CONSEIL PUT IN YES NED LAND WENT ON YOU CAN REPAY YOUR DEBT BY COMING WITH ME WHEN I LEAVE THIS INFERNAL NAUTILUS BY THE WAY CONSEIL SAID ARE WE GOING IN A FAVORABLE DIRECTION
I WAS FINALLY ASSURED THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF IT SOLIDIFYING BY THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH SIX METERS OF ICE HAD BEEN TORN FROM THE SOCKET ONLY FOUR METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED THAT STILL MEANT FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF WORK
COULD COME TO OUR RESCUE DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY SOLIDIFYING IT COULD BURST THESE TRACTS OF ICE IMPRISONING US JUST AS ITS FREEZING CAN BURST THE HARDEST STONES AREN'T YOU AWARE THAT THIS FORCE COULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR SALVATION RATHER THAN OUR DESTRUCTION
BEFORE DIGGING INTO THE ICE THE CAPTAIN HAD TO OBTAIN BORINGS TO INSURE WORKING IN THE BEST DIRECTION LONG BORES WERE DRIVEN INTO THE SIDE WALLS BUT AFTER FIFTEEN METERS THE INSTRUMENTS WERE STILL IMPEDED BY THE THICKNESS OF THOSE WALLS
WITHOUT THIS PRECAUTION WE WOULDN'T HAVE AWAKENED THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SIXTH I RETURNED TO MY MINER'S TRADE WORKING TO REMOVE THE FIFTH METER THE ICE BANK'S SIDE WALLS AND UNDERBELLY HAD VISIBLY THICKENED
AFTER NED WAS DRESSED I REENTERED THE LOUNGE WHOSE WINDOWS HAD BEEN UNCOVERED STATIONED NEXT TO CONSEIL I EXAMINED THE STRATA SURROUNDING AND SUPPORTING THE NAUTILUS SOME MOMENTS LATER WE SAW A DOZEN CREWMEN SET FOOT ON THE SHELF OF ICE
THE LAND OF FIRE A NAME GIVEN IT BY EARLY NAVIGATORS AFTER THEY SAW NUMEROUS CURLS OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE NATIVES HUTS THIS LAND OF FIRE FORMS A HUGE CLUSTER OF ISLANDS OVER THIRTY LEAGUES LONG AND EIGHTY LEAGUES WIDE
SHADOWS ILLUSIONS MELTING AND EVAPORATING OUTSIDE THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT WHEN THE LAST TIPS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS HAD DISAPPEARED BELOW THE HORIZON
HAD HE PERISHED HAD HIS COMPANIONS DIED WITH HIM
EACH ONE OF US DETERMINED TO DO HIS DUTY TO THE END DURING THE NIGHT IN LINE WITH MY FORECASTS A NEW ONE METER SLICE WAS REMOVED FROM THIS IMMENSE SOCKET BUT IN THE MORNING WEARING MY DIVING SUIT
BOILING HOT AT THE BODY OF THE PUMP THE STEAMING WATER WAS INJECTED INTO THE ICY WATER OUTSIDE AND AFTER THREE HOURS HAD PASSED
HE SAID IN A CALM VOICE THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DYING UNDER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE'RE PLACED THIS INEXPLICABLE INDIVIDUAL ACTED LIKE A MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR WORKING OUT A PROBLEM FOR HIS PUPILS THE FIRST WAY HE WENT ON
AND SHAKE THEM CONTINUALLY BUT THIS SUBSTANCE WAS MISSING ON BOARD AND NOTHING ELSE COULD REPLACE IT
TO LEAVE MORE AIR FOR MASTER IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES TO HEAR HIM SAY THESE WORDS SINCE CONDITIONS INSIDE WERE UNIVERSALLY UNBEARABLE
THAT AN INVOLUNTARY TERROR SWEEPS OVER ME AND MY LUNGS STILL SEEM SHORT OF AIR MEANWHILE
PICKS RANG OUT ON THAT BED OF ICE ARMS GREW WEARY HANDS WERE RUBBED RAW BUT WHO CARED ABOUT EXHAUSTION WHAT DIFFERENCE WERE WOUNDS LIFE SUSTAINING AIR REACHED OUR LUNGS WE COULD BREATHE WE COULD BREATHE
AND WHAT POWERFUL INHALATIONS THE CANADIAN DREW LIKE A FURNACE GOING FULL BLAST OUR STRENGTH RETURNED PROMPTLY AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I SAW THAT WE WERE ALONE ON THE PLATFORM NO CREWMEN
AFTER I MONITORED THE OPERATION'S PROGRESS DOUBLE CHECKING IT WITH MANY INSPECTIONS I TOLD THE CAPTAIN IT'S WORKING I THINK SO HE ANSWERED ME WE'VE ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED NOW WE HAVE ONLY ASPHYXIATION TO FEAR
THEN HIS MEN SIMULTANEOUSLY STAKED IT OFF AT SEVERAL POINTS AROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE SOON THEIR PICKS WERE VIGOROUSLY ATTACKING THIS COMPACT MATTER AND HUGE CHUNKS WERE LOOSENED FROM ITS MASS
KEEPING TO ITS NORTHERLY HEADING IT FOLLOWED THE LONG WINDINGS OF SOUTH AMERICA BY THEN WE HAD FARED SIXTEEN THOUSAND LEAGUES SINCE COMING ON BOARD IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
THE INJECTIONS COULDN'T GET IT TO GO A SINGLE DEGREE HIGHER
CAPTAIN NEMO HAD NO LIKING FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BRAZIL'S POPULOUS SHORES BECAUSE HE SHOT BY WITH DIZZYING SPEED
WELL THEN CAPTAIN LET'S FREE OURSELVES WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS WE'LL TRY TO AT LEAST BY CUTTING THROUGH ONE OF THESE WALLS SURROUNDING US WHICH ONE I ASKED BORINGS WILL TELL US THAT
THE AIR COULDN'T BE RENEWED IN THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR ACCORDINGLY THAT DAY IT KEPT GETTING WORSE AN UNBEARABLE HEAVINESS WEIGHED ME DOWN NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THIS AGONIZING SENSATION AFFECTED ME TO AN INTENSE DEGREE
IS TO WORK FASTER THAN THE WATER SOLIDIFIES WE'VE GOT TO GET THERE FIRST THAT'S ALL GET THERE FIRST BY THEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO THIS TYPE OF TALK FOR SEVERAL HOURS THAT DAY I WIELDED MY PICK DOGGEDLY
GOOD LORD PROFESSOR NED LAND ANSWERED ME DON'T MENTION IT WHAT DID WE DO THAT'S SO PRAISEWORTHY NOT A THING IT WAS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE ARITHMETIC YOUR LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN OURS SO WE HAD TO SAVE IT
AFTER TWELVE HOURS HAD GONE BY WE HAD REMOVED FROM THE OUTLINED SURFACE AREA A SLICE OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK HENCE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CUBIC METERS ASSUMING THE SAME WORK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED EVERY TWELVE HOURS
OUR FULL ELECTRIC POWER WAS THEN PUT ON THE PUMPS WHICH INSTANTLY BEGAN TO EXPEL WATER FROM THE BALLAST TANKS AFTER A FEW MINUTES WE HAD CHECKED OUR FALL THE PRESSURE GAUGE SOON INDICATED AN ASCENDING MOVEMENT
THE ICE CRACKED WITH AN ODD RIPPING SOUND LIKE PAPER TEARING AND THE NAUTILUS BEGAN SETTLING DOWNWARD WE'RE GOING THROUGH CONSEIL MUTTERED IN MY EAR I COULDN'T ANSWER HIM I CLUTCHED HIS HAND
IT'S WORTH TRYING I SAID RESOLUTELY SO LET'S TRY IT PROFESSOR
ATOM FOR THE NAUTILUS WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I FELT HALF SUFFOCATED WHAT A NIGHT I'M UNABLE TO DEPICT IT SUCH SUFFERINGS ARE INDESCRIBABLE THE NEXT DAY I WAS SHORT WINDED
THE NAUTILUS'S CHIEF OFFICER SUPERVISED US THE WATER STRUCK ME AS UNUSUALLY COLD BUT I WARMED UP PROMPTLY WHILE WIELDING MY PICK MY MOVEMENTS WERE QUITE FREE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE EXECUTED UNDER A PRESSURE OF THIRTY ATMOSPHERES
DIDN'T PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
ITS COASTLINE LOOKED FLAT BUT HIGH MOUNTAINS ROSE IN THE DISTANCE I EVEN THOUGHT I GLIMPSED MT SARMIENTO
HEADACHES AND STAGGERING FITS OF DIZZINESS MADE ME REEL LIKE A DRUNK MY COMPANIONS WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOMS SOME CREWMEN WERE AT THEIR LAST GASP
THERE WAS NO LACK OF OXYGEN ALL THIS WATER CONTAINED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
NEAR EVENING ONE MORE METER HAD BEEN DUG FROM THE TRENCH WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I WAS WELLNIGH ASPHYXIATED BY THE CARBON DIOXIDE SATURATING THE AIR OH IF ONLY WE HAD THE CHEMICAL METHODS THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DRIVE OUT THIS NOXIOUS GAS
A PYRAMID SHAPED BLOCK OF SHALE WITH A VERY SHARP SUMMIT WHICH DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S CLEAR OR VEILED IN VAPOR PREDICTS FAIR WEATHER OR FOUL AS NED LAND TOLD ME A FIRST CLASS BAROMETER MY FRIEND
MY EYES FLEW TOWARD THE CLOCK IT WAS ELEVEN IN THE MORNING IT HAD TO BE MARCH TWENTY EIGHTH THE NAUTILUS WAS TRAVELING AT THE FRIGHTFUL SPEED OF FORTY MILES PER HOUR IT WAS WRITHING IN THE WATERS
BUT THERE AREN'T TEN FEET OF WATER AHEAD OR ASTERN OF THE NAUTILUS ALL AROUND US THIS FREEZE IS GAINING FAST HOW LONG I ASKED WILL THE OXYGEN IN THE AIR TANKS ENABLE US TO BREATHE ON BOARD THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
WHAT FINE OXYGEN LET MASTER HAVE NO FEARS ABOUT BREATHING THERE'S ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE AS FOR NED LAND HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD BUT HIS WIDE OPEN JAWS WOULD HAVE SCARED OFF A SHARK
BROUGHT TO FULL SPEED THE PROPELLER MADE THE SHEET IRON HULL TREMBLE DOWN TO ITS RIVETS AND WE SPED NORTHWARD BUT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO NAVIGATE UNDER THE ICE BANK TO THE OPEN SEA ANOTHER DAY I WOULD BE DEAD FIRST
INSTEAD OF BREATHING IT THEMSELVES THEY HAD SAVED IT FOR ME AND WHILE THEY WERE SUFFOCATING THEY POURED LIFE INTO ME DROP BY DROP I TRIED TO PUSH THE DEVICE AWAY THEY HELD MY HANDS AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS I COULD BREATHE LUXURIOUSLY
NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WE CUT THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN ON THE THIRTY SEVENTH MERIDIAN PASSING WELL OUT FROM CAPE FRIO MUCH TO NED LAND'S DISPLEASURE
I KNOW HE TOLD ME IN THAT CALM TONE THE MOST DREADFUL OUTLOOK COULDN'T CHANGE IT'S ONE MORE DANGER BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY WAY OF WARDING IT OFF OUR SOLE CHANCE FOR SALVATION
OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE AREA ONLY TWO METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED ONLY TWO METERS SEPARATED US FROM THE OPEN SEA BUT THE SHIP'S AIR TANKS WERE NEARLY EMPTY THE LITTLE AIR THAT REMAINED HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN NOT AN
THOSE STRANGE SEAMEN ON THE NAUTILUS WERE CONTENT WITH THE OXYGEN CIRCULATING INSIDE NOT ONE OF THEM HAD COME UP TO ENJOY THE OPEN AIR THE FIRST WORDS I PRONOUNCED WERE WORDS OF APPRECIATION
IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY SIXTH WE HAD LIVED OFF THE SHIP'S STORES FOR FIVE DAYS AND ALL REMAINING BREATHABLE AIR HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN EVEN TODAY AS I WRITE THESE LINES MY SENSATIONS ARE SO INTENSE
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD THE NEWS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT GOOD LUCK IS MINE WHAT IS IT TOMORROW I END MY DAYS AS A MARIONETTE AND BECOME A BOY LIKE YOU AND ALL MY OTHER FRIENDS
ONLY THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO A LAND WHERE WE SHALL BE ALLOWED TO MAKE ALL THE RACKET WE LIKE FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT PINOCCHIO DID NOT ANSWER BUT SIGHED DEEPLY ONCE
THEY BECAME EVERYBODY'S FRIEND WHO COULD BE HAPPIER THAN THEY WHAT WITH ENTERTAINMENTS AND PARTIES THE HOURS THE DAYS THE WEEKS PASSED LIKE LIGHTNING OH
IN THE LAND OF TOYS NOT EVEN THE SHADOW OF ONE NOT EVEN ONE TEACHER NOT ONE AND ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO STUDY
ENJOY OURSELVES AND BE HAPPY FROM MORN TILL NIGHT AND WHY DID YOU FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF THAT FALSE FRIEND WHY
BOYS GIVE PROMISES VERY EASILY BUT THEY AS EASILY FORGET THEM BUT I AM NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS WHEN I GIVE MY WORD I KEEP IT
BECOME LIKE THOSE OF A DONKEY IN A LITTLE WHILE HE CHANGES INTO A REAL DONKEY AND BEGINS TO BRAY EVERYONE AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER
BLOWING OF TRUMPETS THAT IT WAS DEAFENING EVERYWHERE GROUPS OF BOYS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER SOME PLAYED AT MARBLES AT HOPSCOTCH AT BALL OTHERS RODE ON BICYCLES OR ON WOODEN HORSES SOME PLAYED AT
ROUND AND SHINY AS A BALL OF BUTTER WITH A FACE BEAMING LIKE AN APPLE A LITTLE MOUTH THAT ALWAYS SMILED AND A VOICE SMALL AND WHEEDLING LIKE THAT OF A CAT BEGGING FOR FOOD
EVEN TO THE COLLEGES IF YOU MEET THEM ON THE WAY
WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT MARVELOUS COUNTRY
AT THESE WHISPERED WORDS
TURNING ONCE MORE TO HIS FRIEND
HAS FOUND SOME SURPRISE AWAITING HIM OF THE KIND WHICH PINOCCHIO HAD ON THAT EVENTFUL MORNING OF HIS LIFE THERE ARE BUT FEW
HOME MY GOOD FAIRY WANTS ME TO RETURN HOME BEFORE NIGHT WAIT TWO MINUTES MORE IT'S TOO LATE ONLY TWO MINUTES AND IF THE FAIRY SCOLDS ME
HE LEARNED TO MUMBLE A FEW WORDS WHEN HE LIVED FOR THREE YEARS WITH A
WHERE CAN YOU FIND A PLACE THAT WILL AGREE BETTER WITH YOU AND ME NO SCHOOLS NO TEACHERS NO BOOKS
SAID LAMP WICK ARE YOU GOING ALONE OR WITH OTHERS ALONE THERE WILL BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED OF US WILL YOU WALK AT MIDNIGHT THE WAGON PASSES HERE THAT IS TO TAKE US
THE BOYS SLEPT LAMP WICK SNORED LIKE A DORMOUSE
A VERY QUIET VOICE WHISPERING TO HIM POOR SILLY YOU HAVE DONE AS YOU WISHED BUT YOU ARE GOING TO BE A SORRY BOY
YOU MAY INVITE YOUR FRIENDS TO TOMORROW'S PARTY ONLY REMEMBER TO RETURN HOME BEFORE DARK DO YOU UNDERSTAND
BUT STILL WITHOUT SUCCESS
IN CASE YOU DO DISOBEY YOU WILL BE THE ONE TO SUFFER NOT ANYONE ELSE WHY BECAUSE BOYS WHO DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR ELDERS ALWAYS COME TO GRIEF
LIKE A BOX OF SARDINES THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE THEY WERE PILED ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER THEY COULD HARDLY BREATHE YET NOT ONE WORD OF COMPLAINT WAS HEARD THE THOUGHT
AT THAT MOMENT A LOUD KNOCKING WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR AND A VOICE CALLED TO THEM
GLADLY WITH MY WHOLE HEART WILL YOU LET ME SEE YOUR EARS WHY NOT
SHALL I SEE YOU AT MY PARTY TOMORROW BUT I'M TELLING YOU THAT I GO
AND CLAPPED THEIR HANDS IN HEARTY APPLAUSE SUDDENLY THE LITTLE DONKEY GAVE A KICK WITH HIS TWO HIND FEET AND AT THIS UNEXPECTED MOVE
I'LL WALK
LOOKED ABOUT HIM TO SEE WHENCE THE WORDS HAD COME BUT HE SAW NO ONE THE DONKEYS GALLOPED
TO THINK THAT EVEN YESTERDAY THE IDEA CAME INTO YOUR HEAD TO RETURN HOME TO SEE YOUR FAIRY
I WANT TO SEE YOURS DEAR PINOCCHIO NO YOU MUST SHOW YOURS FIRST
IN A VOICE SWEET AS HONEY AND SOFT AS A FLUTE SAID TO HIS COMPANION TELL ME LAMP WICK DEAR FRIEND HAVE YOU EVER SUFFERED
I LEAVE YOU TO THINK OF THE TERRIBLE GRIEF THE SHAME THE DESPAIR OF THE POOR MARIONETTE HE BEGAN TO CRY TO SCREAM TO KNOCK HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL
BUT THE MOST HORRIBLE MOMENT WAS THE ONE IN WHICH THE TWO POOR CREATURES FELT THEIR TAILS APPEAR OVERCOME WITH SHAME AND GRIEF THEY TRIED TO CRY AND BEMOAN THEIR FATE
AND THEN A SCENE TOOK PLACE WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE BUT IT IS ALL TOO TRUE
AT THE WORD THREE THE TWO BOYS PULLED OFF THEIR CAPS
BOYS WHO STOP STUDYING AND TURN THEIR BACKS
I CAN'T EITHER CRIED PINOCCHIO AND HIS LAUGHTER TURNED TO TEARS AS HE STUMBLED ABOUT HELPLESSLY THEY HAD HARDLY FINISHED SPEAKING WHEN BOTH OF THEM FELL ON ALL FOURS AND BEGAN RUNNING AND JUMPING AROUND THE ROOM
INDEED I KNOW HOW MUCH HE DISLIKED ME AND HOW HE ENJOYED SPEAKING ILL OF ME BUT I AM OF
I AM THE LITTLE MAN
NOR SLEEP NOR DISCOMFORT NO SOONER HAD THE WAGON STOPPED THAN THE LITTLE FAT MAN TURNED TO LAMP WICK WITH BOWS AND SMILES HE ASKED IN A WHEEDLING TONE
HOW WELL I CAN PROVE IT TO YOU A DAY WILL COME
WHICH IS COMING TO GET ME FOR THE LAST TIME ARE YOU COMING OR NOT BUT IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT IN THAT COUNTRY BOYS NEVER HAVE TO STUDY
TO A REAL COUNTRY THE BEST IN THE WORLD A WONDERFUL PLACE
AND I GLADLY FORGIVE HIM
AND STILL OTHERS A MIXTURE OF BROWN AND BLACK HERE AND THERE WERE A FEW WITH LARGE YELLOW AND BLUE STRIPES THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL WAS THAT
DURING WHICH TIME THE TWO FRIENDS
TILL NIGHT WITHOUT EVER SEEING A BOOK OR A DESK OR A SCHOOL BUT MY CHILDREN THERE CAME A MORNING WHEN PINOCCHIO AWOKE
WHAT A GREAT LAND SAID PINOCCHIO FEELING HIS MOUTH WATER WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LAND I HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE BUT I CAN WELL IMAGINE IT WHY DON'T YOU COME TOO
IN THE DISTANCE A SMALL LIGHT FLICKERED A QUEER SOUND COULD BE HEARD SOFT AS A LITTLE BELL AND FAINT AND MUFFLED LIKE THE
I WONDER IF HE TOO HAS DONKEY FEVER BUT PRETENDING HE HAD SEEN NOTHING HE ASKED WITH A SMILE HOW ARE YOU MY DEAR LAMP WICK VERY WELL
ON AWAKENING PINOCCHIO PUT HIS HAND UP TO HIS HEAD AND THERE HE FOUND GUESS HE FOUND THAT DURING THE NIGHT HIS EARS HAD GROWN AT LEAST TEN FULL
TWICE A THIRD TIME FINALLY HE SAID
LITTLE DORMOUSE VERY VERY SICK AND FROM AN ILLNESS WHICH FRIGHTENS ME DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO FEEL THE PULSE A LITTLE FEEL MINE THEN AND TELL ME IF I HAVE A FEVER
AND REASONABLE PINOCCHIO MOUNTED AND THE WAGON STARTED ON ITS WAY WHILE THE DONKEYS GALLOPED ALONG THE STONY ROAD
SAID PINOCCHIO BUT FROM NOW ON I OBEY
LAMP WICK AND ALL THE OTHER BOYS WHO HAD TRAVELED WITH THEM STARTED OUT ON A TOUR OF INVESTIGATION THEY WANDERED EVERYWHERE THEY LOOKED INTO EVERY NOOK AND CORNER HOUSE AND THEATER
THE FAIRY'S WORDS HAD THROWN HIM PINOCCHIO ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO GIVE OUT THE INVITATIONS
DONKEY JUST LIKE THE ONES THAT PULL THE FRUIT CARTS TO MARKET OH WHAT HAVE I DONE
VERY VERY SURE
TELL ME MY FINE BOY DO YOU ALSO WANT TO COME TO MY WONDERFUL COUNTRY
BUT WHAT FEVER IS IT THE DONKEY FEVER
THE LONGER AND THE MORE HAIRY GREW HIS EARS
IN A MOCKING WAY FINALLY
BY CHANCE HE MET HIS FRIEND LAMP WICK WAS I RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERED LAMP WICK
WHAT A PITY IF IT WERE ONLY ONE HOUR I MIGHT WAIT FOR YOU AND THE FAIRY
NEVER MIND ANSWERED LAMP WICK IF THERE'S NO ROOM INSIDE
RUNS AWAY TO THE LAND OF TOYS WITH HIS FRIEND LAMP WICK
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WILL YOU COME WITH US
AND WITH ONE LEAP HE PERCHED HIMSELF THERE
OVERNIGHT THOSE TWO DAINTY ORGANS HAD BECOME AS LONG AS SHOE BRUSHES HE WENT IN SEARCH OF A MIRROR BUT NOT FINDING ANY HE JUST FILLED A BASIN WITH WATER AND LOOKED AT HIMSELF
PINOCCHIO SEARCHED HERE AND THERE AND EVERYWHERE AND FINALLY DISCOVERED HIM HIDING
CATCALLS HAND CLAPPING FOLLOWED THIS PARADE ONE BOY MADE A NOISE LIKE A HEN ANOTHER LIKE A ROOSTER AND A THIRD IMITATED A LION IN HIS DEN ALL TOGETHER THEY CREATED SUCH A PANDEMONIUM THAT IT
THINK HOW GREAT WAS HIS SURPRISE
BUT TO BE ALLOWED TO RIDE
VACATION BEGINS ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY AND ENDS ON THE LAST DAY OF DECEMBER
IN THE MEANTIME THE NIGHT BECAME DARKER AND DARKER
AND FOUND A GREAT SURPRISE AWAITING HIM A SURPRISE WHICH MADE HIM FEEL VERY UNHAPPY
LIKE A MOUSE IN A PARMESAN CHEESE IS THAT REALLY TRUE WHY SHOULD I LIE TO YOU I BEG YOUR PARDON MY FRIEND BUT
FOR ITS WHEELS WERE BOUND WITH STRAW AND RAGS IT WAS DRAWN BY TWELVE PAIR OF DONKEYS ALL OF THE SAME SIZE BUT ALL OF DIFFERENT COLOR SOME WERE GRAY OTHERS WHITE
GOOD BY THEN AND REMEMBER ME TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS
BUT NOTHING IS QUITE PERFECT IN THIS LIFE AT ANY TIME I HAD MADE A PIPE A WHILE BACK AND ALSO SOME PRETTY FAIR TOBACCO NOT THE REAL THING BUT WHAT SOME OF THE INDIANS USE THE INSIDE BARK OF THE WILLOW
AND YOU HAD TO BE ALWAYS CHANGING HANDS AND PASSING YOUR SPEAR OVER TO THE OTHER FOOT IT GOT SO IRKSOME FOR ONE HAND TO HOLD IT LONG AT A TIME WELL
IMAGINING THE HANDKERCHIEF PICTURING THE HANDKERCHIEF AND IT WAS BITTER AND AGGRAVATING TO HAVE THE SALT SWEAT KEEP TRICKLING DOWN INTO MY EYES AND I COULDN'T GET AT IT IT SEEMS LIKE A LITTLE THING ON PAPER
SO THERE YOU ARE NOTHING BUT IRON BETWEEN IT IS NOT A LIGHT THING LET IT SOUND AS IT MAY FIRST IT IS ONE PLACE THEN ANOTHER THEN SOME MORE
EXCEPT THAT BY THE CUSTOMS OF CHIVALRY SHE WAS MY PROPERTY UNTIL SOME KNIGHT SHOULD WIN HER FROM ME IN THE FIELD SHE HAD HUNTED BRITAIN OVER FOR ME HAD FOUND ME AT THE HANGING BOUT OUTSIDE OF LONDON
FROM BEING THE BEST ELECTRIC LIGHTED TOWN IN THE KINGDOM AND THE MOST LIKE A RECUMBENT SUN OF ANYTHING YOU EVER SAW IT WAS BECOME SIMPLY A BLOT A BLOT UPON DARKNESS
BUT SO I GOT HIS BANDANNA HE COULD KEEP HIS HARDWARE FOR ALL OF ME MEANTIME
HOW DEAR AND GOOD IT IS OF YOU TOO BUT I WANT TO HEAR THESE LIPS OF YOURS WHICH ARE ALSO MINE UTTER IT FIRST THEN ITS MUSIC WILL BE PERFECT PLEASED TO THE MARROW SHE MURMURED HELLO CENTRAL I DIDN'T LAUGH
A FLY GOT IN THROUGH THE BARS AND SETTLED ON MY NOSE AND THE BARS WERE STUCK AND WOULDN'T WORK AND I COULDN'T GET THE VISOR UP AND I COULD ONLY SHAKE MY HEAD WHICH WAS
INVASION INVASION IS A TRIVIALITY TO IT
DURING TWO WEEKS AND A HALF WE WATCHED BY THE CRIB AND IN OUR DEEP SOLICITUDE
ONLY ONE FIELD AND ONE HUT IN SIGHT AND THEY SO FAR AWAY THAT NOBODY COULD SEE US FROM THERE IT WILL BE WELL TO MOVE A LITTLE OFF THE ROAD AND PUT IN THE WHOLE DAY DRILLING YOU SIRE AFTER THE
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU PERSPIRE THAT WAY IN RIVERS THERE COMES A TIME WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WELL WHEN YOU ITCH YOU ARE INSIDE YOUR HANDS ARE OUTSIDE
AND HOW ONE GRIEVES WHEN IT WASTES AWAY AND DISSOLVES INTO CORRECTNESS KNOWING IT WILL NEVER VISIT HIS BEREAVED EAR AGAIN WELL
WE COULD IMAGINE NO EXPLANATION THAT WOULD BEGIN TO EXPLAIN HAD THERE BEEN AN INVASION
PLEASE WALK THIRTY YARDS SO THAT I CAN GET A PERSPECTIVE ON THE THING NOW THEN YOUR HEAD'S RIGHT SPEED'S RIGHT SHOULDERS RIGHT EYES RIGHT CHIN RIGHT
THAT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME WHEN I PUT IT THERE AND IN FACT I DIDN'T KNOW IT I SUPPOSED IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY CONVENIENT THERE AND SO NOW THE THOUGHT OF ITS BEING THERE SO HANDY AND CLOSE BY AND YET
SPIRITUAL WANTS AND INSTINCTS ARE AS VARIOUS IN THE HUMAN FAMILY AS ARE PHYSICAL APPETITES
SHE SADDLED THAT CRY OF MINE UPON OUR CHILD CONCEIVING IT TO BE THE NAME OF SOME LOST DARLING OF MINE IT TOUCHED ME TO TEARS
OPPRESSION INSULT AND THE OTHER SEVERAL AND COMMON INHUMANITIES THAT SAP THE MANLINESS OUT OF A MAN AND MAKE HIM A LOYAL AND PROPER AND APPROVED SUBJECT AND A SATISFACTION TO HIS MASTERS
CLEAREST AND COLDEST OF RUNLETS WENT FRISKING AND GOSSIPING OVER ITS REEFS AND MAKING A SORT OF WHISPERING MUSIC COMFORTABLE TO HEAR AND AT TIMES WE LEFT THE WORLD BEHIND AND ENTERED INTO THE SOLEMN GREAT DEEPS AND
THERE VERY GOOD EYES TOO HIGH PRAY DON'T LOOK AT THE HORIZON LOOK AT THE GROUND TEN STEPS IN FRONT OF YOU AH THAT IS BETTER THAT IS VERY GOOD WAIT
AN EARTHQUAKE A PESTILENCE HAD THE NATION BEEN SWEPT OUT OF EXISTENCE BUT GUESSING WAS PROFITLESS I MUST GO AT ONCE I BORROWED THE KING'S NAVY
AND EATEN UP BY RELENTLESS CREDITORS YOU ARE OUT OF WORK WHICH IS HORSE SHOEING LET US SAY AND CAN GET NONE
A SHIP NO BIGGER THAN A STEAM LAUNCH AND WAS SOON READY THE PARTING AH YES THAT WAS HARD AS I WAS DEVOURING THE CHILD WITH LAST KISSES IT BRISKED UP AND JABBERED OUT ITS VOCABULARY
WITH THE WIDE HIGHWAY OF SALT WATER ALL TO MYSELF THERE WERE SHIPS IN THE HARBOR AT DOVER BUT THEY WERE NAKED AS TO SAILS AND THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE ABOUT THEM IT WAS SUNDAY YET AT CANTERBURY THE STREETS WERE EMPTY STRANGEST OF ALL
THE ONE IS EARTHLY THE OTHER DIVINE IN MY DREAMS ALONG AT FIRST I STILL WANDERED THIRTEEN CENTURIES AWAY
AND FOR WEEKS AFTERWARD I COULD HEAR MY BONES CLACK WHEN I WALKED SHE NEVER FOUND OUT HER MISTAKE THE FIRST TIME SHE HEARD THAT FORM OF SALUTE USED AT THE TELEPHONE SHE WAS SURPRISED AND NOT PLEASED
WE WERE BACK IN THIS WORLD IN ONE INSTANT THEN WE LOOKED THE SAME STARTLED THOUGHT INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES AT THE SAME MOMENT MORE THAN TWO WEEKS GONE AND THAT SHIP NOT BACK YET IN ANOTHER MINUTE I APPEARED IN THE PRESENCE OF MY TRAIN THEY HAD BEEN STEEPED IN TROUBLED BODINGS ALL THIS TIME
THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AND IT MADE FOOLS OF US FOR JOY THE DARLING MISPRONUNCIATIONS OF CHILDHOOD DEAR ME THERE'S NO MUSIC THAT CAN TOUCH IT
SO LATELY HAD MADE THESE GLISTENING EXPANSES POPULOUS AND BEAUTIFUL WITH ITS WHITE WINGED FLOCKS VANISHED EVERY ONE NOT A SAIL FROM VERGE TO VERGE NOT A SMOKE BANK
REVENUES WERE ALREADY QUADRUPLED AND YET THE BURDEN WAS SO MUCH MORE EQUABLY DISTRIBUTED THAN BEFORE THAT ALL THE KINGDOM FELT A SENSE OF RELIEF AND THE PRAISES OF MY ADMINISTRATION WERE HEARTY AND GENERAL
TRAMPING AN HOUR IN THE CHILL DAWN I CAME TO A RESOLUTION THE KING MUST BE DRILLED THINGS COULD NOT GO ON SO HE MUST BE TAKEN IN HAND AND DELIBERATELY AND CONSCIENTIOUSLY DRILLED
IN FACT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT CAN RIGHT THE MATTER BUT PRACTICE THIS IS A GOOD PLACE FOR IT ROOTS AND STONY GROUND TO BREAK UP YOUR STATELY GAIT A REGION NOT LIABLE TO INTERRUPTION
AND MY UNSATISFIED SPIRIT WENT CALLING AND HARKING ALL UP AND DOWN THE UNREPLYING VACANCIES OF A VANISHED WORLD MANY A TIME SANDY HEARD THAT IMPLORING CRY COME FROM MY LIPS IN MY SLEEP WITH A GRAND MAGNANIMITY
AH YOUR GRACE THAT IS NOT WELL DONE IN WHAT LACKETH IT THESE PEOPLE DO NOT CALL EACH OTHER
TO DIRT LIKE THAT
WE CROSSED BROAD NATURAL LAWNS SPARKLING WITH DEW AND WE MOVED LIKE SPIRITS THE CUSHIONED TURF GIVING OUT NO SOUND OF FOOTFALL WE DREAMED ALONG THROUGH GLADES IN A
BEFORE YOU COULD EVEN GET YOUR EYE ON THE PLACE WHERE THE NOISE WAS AND WHERE ONLY THE EARLIEST BIRDS WERE TURNING OUT AND GETTING TO BUSINESS WITH A SONG HERE AND A QUARREL YONDER AND A MYSTERIOUS
AND HAD STRAIGHTWAY RESUMED HER OLD PLACE AT MY SIDE IN THE PLACIDEST WAY AND AS OF RIGHT I WAS A NEW ENGLANDER AND IN MY OPINION THIS SORT OF PARTNERSHIP WOULD COMPROMISE HER
HOLES GRUBBED IN THE EARTH AND THE MINERAL BROUGHT UP IN SACKS OF HIDE BY HAND AT THE RATE OF A TON A DAY BUT I HAD BEGUN TO PUT THE MINING ON A SCIENTIFIC BASIS AS EARLY AS I COULD
THE VERY CATS WOULD KNOW THIS MASQUERADER FOR A HUMBUG AND NO PEASANT SO I CALLED A HALT AND SAID SIRE AS BETWEEN CLOTHES AND COUNTENANCE YOU ARE ALL RIGHT THERE IS NO DISCREPANCY
AS SURE A FACT AND AS SUBSTANTIAL A FACT AS ANY SERENE VOLCANO STANDING INNOCENT WITH ITS SMOKELESS SUMMIT IN THE BLUE SKY AND GIVING NO SIGN OF THE RISING HELL IN ITS BOWELS
NOT THE WHOLE IDEA AT ONCE WOULD YOU HAVE A SEAT ALSO AND SIT IF I DID NOT SIT THE MAN WOULD PERCEIVE THAT WE WERE ONLY PRETENDING TO BE EQUALS AND PLAYING THE DECEPTION PRETTY POORLY TOO
THE VAST CASTLE LOOMED BLACK UPON THE HILLTOP NOT A SPARK VISIBLE ABOUT IT THE DRAWBRIDGE WAS DOWN THE GREAT GATE STOOD WIDE I ENTERED WITHOUT CHALLENGE MY OWN HEELS MAKING THE ONLY SOUND I HEARD
PERMITTING NOTHING OF IT IN MY OTHER EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS I COULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN SECT THE PREFERENCE AND MADE EVERYBODY A PRESBYTERIAN WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO AFFRONT A LAW OF HUMAN NATURE
NOW TIS RIGHT NOT QUITE
AND RELIEVE ME OF IT THEN SHE EMPTIED THE CONVENIENCES OUT OF IT AND FETCHED IT FULL OF WATER AND I DRANK AND THEN STOOD UP AND SHE POURED THE REST DOWN INSIDE THE ARMOR ONE CANNOT THINK HOW REFRESHING IT WAS
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CRUEL TO CONFESS IT AND SPOIL HER PRETTY GAME SO I NEVER LET ON BUT SAID YES I KNOW SWEETHEART
AND MOREOVER I COULDN'T SEEM TO STAND THAT SHIELD SLATTING AND BANGING NOW ABOUT MY BREAST
NO PRIEST A FUNERAL WITHOUT BELL BOOK OR CANDLE THERE WAS A CHURCH THERE CLOSE AT HAND BUT THEY PASSED IT BY WEEPING AND DID NOT ENTER IT I GLANCED UP AT THE BELFRY
SANDY WHAT A RIGHT HEART SHE HAD HOW SIMPLE AND GENUINE AND GOOD SHE WAS SHE WAS A FLAWLESS WIFE AND MOTHER AND YET I HAD MARRIED HER FOR NO OTHER PARTICULAR REASONS
NO NO FOR HE MAY BE A FREEMAN AH SO THEN PERADVENTURE I SHOULD CALL HIM GOODMAN THAT WOULD ANSWER YOUR GRACE
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE TURNED THE CORNER AND BEGAN TO MEND GRATEFUL IT ISN'T THE TERM THERE ISN'T ANY TERM FOR IT YOU KNOW THAT YOURSELF IF YOU'VE WATCHED YOUR CHILD THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW
YOU SEE THE SUN WAS BEATING DOWN AND WARMING UP THE IRON MORE AND MORE ALL THE TIME WELL WHEN YOU ARE HOT THAT WAY EVERY LITTLE THING IRRITATES YOU WHEN I TROTTED I RATTLED LIKE A CRATE OF DISHES AND THAT ANNOYED ME
EXCEPT THE MAN BE OF THE SERF CLASS AND FINALLY
OUR FIRST VENTURE IN THIS LINE THESE WIRES WERE FOR PRIVATE SERVICE ONLY AS YET AND MUST BE KEPT PRIVATE UNTIL A RIPER DAY SHOULD COME WE HAD A GANG OF MEN ON THE ROAD WORKING MAINLY BY NIGHT
THEN I SHOULD BE READY ALL THE CHANCES WERE THAT AT THE END OF THAT TIME
I DON'T DENY THAT I AM NOT BETTER THAN OTHERS WE COULDN'T SEEM TO MEET ANYBODY IN THIS LONESOME BRITAIN NOT EVEN AN OGRE AND IN THE MOOD I WAS IN THEN IT WAS WELL FOR THE OGRE THAT IS AN OGRE WITH A HANDKERCHIEF
BUT NONE OF THE BALLS STRUCK THE PIRATE OR HIS JARS AND HE SOON FLOATED OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING KICKING OUT WITH HIS LEGS AND PADDLING AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE HELD ON TO THE JARS WITH THE OTHER HE AT LAST MANAGED TO REACH THE LAND
THE NOISE OF FIRING DOGGED THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO BE DRIVEN A LITTLE WAY BUT IT ALWAYS RETURNED AGAIN WITH INCREASED INSOLENCE THE MEN MUTTERED AND CURSED THROWING BLACK LOOKS IN ITS DIRECTION
NEVER ONCE SETTING HIS FOOT UPON THE GROUND BY WHICH IS MEANT MUD WATER AND ROOTS BUT SWINGING HIMSELF BY HIS HANDS AND ARMS FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AS IF HE HAD BEEN A GREAT APE ONLY RESTING OCCASIONALLY DRAWING HIMSELF UPON A STOUT LIMB WHERE HE MIGHT SIT FOR A WHILE AND GET HIS BREATH
HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RID OF HIS FETTERS AND COULD MOVE ABOUT AS FREELY AS A TIGER IN A CAGE TO GET OUT OF THIS CAGE WAS BARTHOLEMY'S FIRST OBJECT IT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASY BECAUSE IN THE COURSE OF TIME SOME ONE WOULD COME INTO THE HOLD
WHEN HE HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FREE PASSAGE HE WOULD DASH IN AND HURRY ACROSS AT OTHER TIMES GREAT FORESTS STRETCHED DOWN TO THE VERY COAST AND THROUGH THESE HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE HIS WAY
BUT THEIR WAY WAS A VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM ANY WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP THEY ROWED OFF INTO THE DARKNESS INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE TOWN AND WAITED UNTIL NEARLY DAYBREAK THEN THEY BOLDLY MADE FOR THE MAN OF WAR
HE CRUISED ABOUT THE COAST AT SOME DISTANCE FROM DE LOS CAYOS ENDEAVORING TO PROCURE TWO SMALL BOATS IN WHICH TO APPROACH THE TOWN BUT ALTHOUGH HIS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE THE PRESENCE OF HIS VESSEL WAS DISCOVERED BY SOME FISHERMEN
THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD BARTHOLEMY AND THE OTHERS IN CHARGE DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN IMPORTANT CAPTURE HE HAD MADE HE SUPPOSED THAT THESE PIRATES WERE ORDINARY BUCCANEERS AND IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO KEEP THEM AS HIS OWN PRIVATE PRISONERS
SAID A MAN HERE WE ARE EVERYBODY FIGHTIN BLOOD AN DESTRUCTION
FOR AS THEY WERE ALL VERY ABLE BODIED MEN THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL ON A SHIP BUT WHEN HIS VESSEL WAS SAFELY MOORED AND IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE HAD A COMPANY OF PIRATES ON BOARD
AND THERE HE COMPOSED A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR OF HAVANA A PART OF WHICH READ AS FOLLOWS I SHALL NEVER HENCEFORWARD GIVE QUARTER UNTO ANY SPANIARD WHATSOEVER
IN A CLEAR SPACE THE TROOPS WERE AT LAST HALTED REGIMENTS AND BRIGADES BROKEN AND DETACHED THROUGH THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THICKETS GREW TOGETHER AGAIN AND LINES WERE FACED TOWARD THE PURSUING BARK OF THE ENEMY'S INFANTRY
AND THE ATHLETIC BUCCANEER THOUGHT THAT HE COULD EASILY GET THE BETTER OF WHOEVER MIGHT OPEN THE HATCH BUT THE NEXT ACT IN THIS TRULY MELODRAMATIC PERFORMANCE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL MORE DIFFICULT FOR IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THE SHIP IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR BARTHOLEMY TO SWIM TO SHORE
BARTHOLEMY PERCEIVED AN OLD BOARD IN WHICH THERE WERE SOME LONG AND HEAVY RUSTY NAILS GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY THE INDEFATIGABLE TRAVELLER SET ABOUT A WORK WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF THE OLD WOMAN WHO WANTED A NEEDLE
BUT AFTER A DIET OF ROOTS SHELLFISH MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY AGREEABLE CHANGE AND THEY GAVE HIM ALL THE STRENGTH AND VIGOR HE NEEDED VERY OFTEN HE FOUND STREAMS AND INLETS WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO FORD
IT SEEMED THAT THE CANNON HAD COME FROM ALL PARTS AND WERE ENGAGED IN A STUPENDOUS WRANGLE IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A SENTENCE HEARD THE YOUTH WISHED TO LAUNCH A JOKE A QUOTATION FROM NEWSPAPERS HE DESIRED TO SAY
AND THEN WE BEGIN TO FIGHT AND THE REBS HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT DON'T TELL ME IT'S JUST LUCK I KNOW BETTER IT'S THIS DERNED OLD THE FRIEND SEEMED JADED BUT HE INTERRUPTED HIS COMRADE WITH A VOICE OF CALM CONFIDENCE
CHAPTER THIRTEEN A RESURRECTED PIRATE
WHO HAD BEEN PRESERVED FROM THE FATE OF THE OTHERS BECAUSE L'OLONNOIS HAD SOME CORRESPONDENCE TO ATTEND TO AND HE NEEDED A MESSENGER TO CARRY A LETTER THE PIRATE CAPTAIN WENT INTO THE CABIN WHERE HE FOUND WRITING MATERIALS READY TO HIS HAND
AND HE ALSO DISCOVERED MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW PROVISIONS ON BOARD FOR WHEN THE VESSEL WAS SENT FROM HAVANA IT WAS SUPPOSED SHE WOULD MAKE BUT A VERY SHORT CRUISE
ALWAYS THE NOISE OF SKIRMISHERS CAME FROM THE WOODS ON THE FRONT AND LEFT AND THE DIN ON THE RIGHT HAD GROWN TO FRIGHTFUL PROPORTIONS THE GUNS WERE ROARING WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S PAUSE FOR BREATH
AND I DON'T SEE ANY SENSE IN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING YET ALWAYS LOSING THROUGH SOME DERNED OLD LUNKHEAD OF A GENERAL
BUT STILL STILL WE DON'T HAVE NO LUCK WELL THEN IF WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL AN DON'T EVER WHIP IT MUST BE THE GENERAL'S FAULT SAID THE YOUTH GRANDLY AND DECISIVELY
FOR A MOMENT HE SANK BELOW THE SURFACE BUT THE TWO AIR TIGHT JARS QUICKLY ROSE AND BORE HIM UP WITH THEM THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON BOARD THE SHIP THERE WAS SOME RANDOM FIRING OF MUSKETS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLASHING WHICH THE WATCH HAD HEARD
ONE CANOE ATTACKING HER ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER BEFORE THE SPANISH COULD COMPREHEND WHAT HAD HAPPENED THERE WERE MORE THAN TWENTY PIRATES UPON THEIR DECKS THE DREADED L'OLONNOIS AT THEIR HEAD
BUT NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP HIS PROJECT ENTERED HIS MIND AS THE SPANISH VESSEL WAS IN HIS WAY HE WOULD ATTACK HER AND GET HER OUT OF HIS WAY IF THE THING COULD BE DONE IN THIS NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS HE WAS OBLIGED TO USE STRATAGEM
YOU'VE BEEN JAWIN LIKE A LOT A OLD HENS
DON'T WE DO ALL THAT MEN CAN DEMANDED THE YOUTH LOUDLY HE WAS SECRETLY DUMFOUNDED AT THIS SENTIMENT WHEN IT CAME FROM HIS LIPS FOR A MOMENT HIS FACE LOST ITS VALOR AND HE LOOKED GUILTILY ABOUT HIM
THE DISORDERED HURRYING LINES OF THE ENEMY COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN DOWN THROUGH THE GROVES AND LITTLE FIELDS THEY WERE YELLING SHRILL AND EXULTANT AT THIS SIGHT THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY PERSONAL MATTERS AND BECAME GREATLY ENRAGED HE EXPLODED IN LOUD SENTENCES
THIS PART OF THE WORLD LED A STRANGE BATTLEFUL EXISTENCE THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT WAS MARCHED TO RELIEVE A COMMAND THAT HAD LAIN LONG IN SOME DAMP TRENCHES THE MEN TOOK POSITIONS BEHIND A CURVING LINE OF RIFLE PITS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED UP LIKE A LARGE FURROW
HE WISHED TO GIVE SPAIN A LESSON WHICH WOULD MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE INTERFERED WITH IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS ENTERPRISES AND HE DETERMINED TO ALLOW HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF PERSONALLY TEACHING THIS LESSON
IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BELIEVE IT THE GOOD NEWS OF THE DEATH OF L'OLONNOIS HAD COME FROM CAMPEACHY TO HAVANA AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LATTER TOWN ALSO REJOICED GREATLY TO BE NOW TOLD THAT THIS SCOURGE OF THE WEST INDIES WAS ALIVE
THE TROOPS SIFTING THROUGH THE FOREST WERE SULLEN IN THE YOUTH'S COMPANY ONCE A MAN'S LAUGH RANG OUT A DOZEN SOLDIERS TURNED THEIR FACES QUICKLY TOWARD HIM AND FROWNED WITH VAGUE DISPLEASURE
THE MAN OF WAR WAS ANCHORED NOT VERY FAR FROM THE TOWN AND WHEN ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE WATCH ON DECK SAW SOME CANOES APPROACHING THEY SUPPOSED THEM TO BE BOATS FROM SHORE
NOW A PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAPPENED TO HIM ALTHOUGH TO AN ORDINARY TRAVELLER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER ON THE EDGE OF THE SHORE WHERE IT HAD FLOATED DOWN FROM SOME REGION HIGHER UP THE RIVER
IF THEY MET AN ENEMY WHO WAS WEAK THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM AND IF THEY MET WITH ONE WHO WAS A GOOD DEAL STRONGER THAN THEMSELVES THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM ALL THE SAME WHEN THE TIME CAME TO FIGHT THEY FOUGHT
THEY WERE WORN EXHAUSTED HAVING SLEPT BUT LITTLE AND LABORED MUCH
ALTHOUGH HE COULD HEAR THE ROARS AND SCREAMS OF WILD BEASTS ALL ABOUT HIM ANY ONE WHO IS AFRAID TO GO DOWN INTO A DARK CELLAR TO GET SOME APPLES FROM A BARREL AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SORT OF MIND POSSESSED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ
AT THIS TIME THERE WAS AN INTERPOSITION BY THE SAVAGE MINDED LIEUTENANT WHO WAS OBLIGED TO VENT SOME OF HIS INWARD DISSATISFACTION UPON HIS MEN YOU BOYS SHUT RIGHT UP
HERE WAS A NICE LITTLE PRIZE THAT COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM AND L'OLONNOIS HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS TO SEIZE IT AS HE COULD NOT SAIL A SHIP DIRECTLY UP TO THE TOWN
LESS TALKIN AN MORE FIGHTIN IS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU BOYS I NEVER SAW SECH GABBLING JACKASSES HE PAUSED READY TO POUNCE UPON ANY MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO REPLY
BUT A MAN IN HIS SITUATION WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO GIVE UP READILY
BY THE TIME THE WAR VESSEL HAD ARRIVED AT DE LOS CAYOS L'OLONNOIS HAD MADE HIS PREPARATION TO ATTACK THE PLACE HE HAD PROCURED TWO LARGE CANOES AND IN THESE HE HAD INTENDED TO ROW UP TO THE TOWN AND LAND WITH HIS MEN
AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM WHICH SEEMS A STRANGE FAILING IN A HARDY SAILOR WITH SO MANY OTHER NAUTICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE ROUGH HOLD WHERE HE WAS SHUT UP OUR PIRATE PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUS AND EARNEST
GATHERING UP HIS LEGS SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF REACH OF THE ALLIGATORS AND WITH A LONG POLE PUSHED HIMSELF OFF FROM SHORE SOMETIMES PADDLING AND SOMETIMES PUSHING HIS POLE AGAINST THE BOTTOM HE AT LAST GOT ACROSS THE RIVER AND TOOK UP HIS JOURNEY UPON DRY LAND
INFORMING THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND THAT THE CRUEL PIRATE L'OLONNOIS WAS IN A SHIP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR VILLAGE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED TO ATTACK WHEN THE GOVERNOR HEARD THIS ASTONISHING TALE
ALL QUIET ON THE RAPPAHANNOCK BUT THE GUNS REFUSED TO PERMIT EVEN A COMMENT UPON THEIR UPROAR HE NEVER SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE BUT AT LAST THE GUNS STOPPED AND AMONG THE MEN IN THE RIFLE PITS RUMORS AGAIN FLEW
BARING HIS MUSCULAR AND HAIRY RIGHT ARM HE CLUTCHED THE HANDLE OF HIS SHARP AND HEAVY CUTLASS AND ORDERED THE PRISONERS TO BE BROUGHT UP FROM BELOW ONE AT A TIME AND CONDUCTED TO THE PLACE WHERE HE STOOD
WHICH WAS WHAT HE WISHED TO DO IF THE HOUNDS SHOULD GET UPON HIS TRAIL HE WAS A LOST MAN THE DESPERATE PIRATE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE BLOODHOUNDS NO CHANCE TO FOLLOW HIM AND FOR THREE DAYS HE REMAINED IN A MARSHY FOREST IN THE DARK RECESSES OF WHICH HE COULD HIDE
NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE WE GO OR WHY WE GO WE JUST GET FIRED AROUND FROM PILLAR TO POST AND GET LICKED HERE AND GET LICKED THERE AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S DONE FOR IT MAKES A MAN FEEL LIKE A DAMN KITTEN IN A BAG
WHO WERE LYING DOWN BEHIND WHATEVER PROTECTION THEY HAD COLLECTED A BATTERY HAD TRUNDLED INTO POSITION IN THE REAR AND WAS THOUGHTFULLY SHELLING THE DISTANCE THE REGIMENT UNMOLESTED AS YET
AND HE DID NOT AT ALL DESIRE TO GIVE UP SUCH A VALUABLE ADDITION TO HIS CREW BUT THE MERCHANT GREW VERY ANGRY FOR HE KNEW THAT BARTHOLEMY HAD INFLICTED GREAT INJURY ON SPANISH COMMERCE AND AS THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM HE WENT TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN AND REPORTED THE CASE
THE DAY HAD GROWN MORE WHITE UNTIL THE SUN SHED HIS FULL RADIANCE UPON THE THRONGED FOREST A SORT OF A GUST OF BATTLE CAME SWEEPING TOWARD THAT PART OF THE LINE WHERE LAY THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT THE FRONT SHIFTED A TRIFLE TO MEET IT SQUARELY
BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HEART AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS IRONS WHICH WERE PROBABLY VERY CLUMSY AFFAIRS AT LAST CARING LITTLE HOW MUCH HE SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS SKIN
INCREASED TO A LOUD AND JOYOUS BURST AND THEN AS THE SUN WENT SERENELY UP THE SKY THROWING ILLUMINATING RAYS INTO THE GLOOMY THICKETS IT BROKE FORTH INTO PROLONGED PEALINGS THE WOODS BEGAN TO CRACKLE AS IF AFIRE
THIS CAME SOON AFTER NIGHTFALL A MAN DESCENDED WITH A LANTERN TO SEE THAT THE PRISONER WAS STILL SECURE LET US HOPE THAT IT WAS NOT THE SOLDIER WHO HAD KINDLY INFORMED HIM OF HIS FATE AND AS SOON AS HE WAS FAIRLY IN THE HOLD BARTHOLEMY SPRANG UPON HIM
WHICH WAS FORTY LEAGUES AWAY BUT WHERE HE HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE HE WOULD FIND SOME FRIENDS WHEN HE CAME OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES HE MOUNTED A SMALL HILL AND LOOKED BACK UPON THE TOWN THE PUBLIC SQUARE WAS LIGHTED AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE SAW THE GALLOWS WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR HIS EXECUTION
CUT OFF HIS HEAD LIKEWISE AND HIS BODY WAS TUMBLED INTO THE SEA AFTER THOSE OF HIS COMPANIONS NOW THERE WAS NOT A SPANIARD LEFT ON BOARD THE GREAT SHIP EXCEPT ONE MAN
BUT NOW THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO ALTER HIS PLANS THE ORDINARY PERSON IN COMMAND OF TWO SMALL BOATS WHO SHOULD SUDDENLY DISCOVER THAT A VILLAGE WHICH HE SUPPOSED ALMOST DEFENCELESS WAS PROTECTED BY A LARGE MAN OF WAR
MADE HER ALMOST TURN FROM HER WITH HORROR NO REMEMBRANCE OF REGINALD NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT GAVE ONE LOOK OF EMBARRASSMENT
SOME KNEW WHAT OTHERS KNEW AND OTHERS DIDN'T AND IF THEY DIDN'T THEN OTHERS AGAIN HAD BETTER BE CAREFUL
NOR IN THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN JOURNALISM AND LITERATURE WHICH WAS STARTED AS A CONVERSATIONAL HARE THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE DARTED AFTER IT WITH CRIES OF JOY MARGARET LEADING THEM
THE PARTICULAR MILLIONAIRE WHO OWNED THE FREEHOLD OF WICKHAM PLACE AND DESIRED TO ERECT BABYLONIAN FLATS UPON IT WHAT RIGHT HAD HE TO STIR SO LARGE A PORTION OF THE QUIVERING JELLY HE WAS NOT A FOOL
OR LIVERPOOL STREET IN THE MORNING THE CITY INHALING OR THE SAME THOROUGHFARES IN THE EVENING THE CITY EXHALING HER EXHAUSTED AIR WE REACH IN DESPERATION BEYOND THE FOG BEYOND THE VERY STARS THE VOIDS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE RANSACKED TO JUSTIFY THE MONSTER
NEVER MIND THAT IT WOULD BE CHEAP TO ME WHAT EVER IT COST RETURNED THE LITTLE MAN ANYTHING ELSE JOHN A SMALL BOX REPLIED THE CARRIER HERE YOU ARE FOR CALEB PLUMMER
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SPARED HERSELF ALL THE TROUBLE OF URGING A REMOVAL WHICH LADY SUSAN HAD DOUBTLESS RESOLVED ON FROM THE FIRST FREDERICA'S VISIT WAS NOMINALLY FOR SIX WEEKS BUT HER MOTHER THOUGH INVITING HER TO RETURN IN ONE OR TWO AFFECTIONATE LETTERS
AND FOR DISCUSSING WITH HUMILITY I AM TOO OLD WE NEVER DISCUSS ANYTHING
WHAT I THINK THE TRUTH YOU SEE
FOR THAT GOOD DOG MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN HIS MASTER HAD IT SEEMED BEEN WATCHING THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS SLEEP LEST HE SHOULD WALK OFF WITH A FEW YOUNG POPLAR TREES THAT WERE TIED UP BEHIND THE CART
MARGARET WAS NOT SHOCKED BUT WENT ON SEWING FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SHE REPLIED
NO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR NINNIES THEN THEY WERE MEN WHO HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO SAID HIS SISTER FEELING THAT SHE WAS ENTITLED TO SCORE THIS POINT SO TAKE WARNING YOU MUST WORK OR ELSE YOU MUST PRETEND TO WORK WHICH IS WHAT I DO
THAT'S WHERE IT CUTS WHAT'S THE DAMAGE JOHN I'LL DAMAGE YOU SAID JOHN IF YOU INQUIRE DOT VERY NEAR WELL IT'S LIKE YOU TO SAY SO OBSERVED THE LITTLE MAN IT'S YOUR KIND WAY
WON'T YOU EVEN HAVE COFFEE THEY LEFT THE DINING ROOM CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND AS MISSUS WILCOX BUTTONED UP HER JACKET SHE SAID WHAT AN INTERESTING LIFE YOU ALL LEAD IN LONDON NO
I DECLARE I'VE CLEAN FORGOTTEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE CART SAID JOHN HE WAS ASLEEP AMONG THE STRAW THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM I'VE
VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE TO THE STATE COULD BE DERIVED FROM THE EPISTOLARY INTERCOURSE OF MISSUS VERNON AND HER NIECE
WHILE HER SHALLOWS WASHED MORE WIDELY AGAINST THE HILLS OF SURREY AND OVER THE FIELDS OF HERTFORDSHIRE THIS FAMOUS BUILDING HAD ARISEN THAT WAS DOOMED TODAY WHITEHALL HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED IT WOULD BE THE TURN OF REGENT STREET TOMORROW
ACKNOWLEDGING IN TERMS OF GRATEFUL DELIGHT THAT FREDERICA WAS NOW GROWING EVERY DAY MORE AND MORE WHAT A PARENT COULD DESIRE MISSUS VERNON SURPRIZED AND INCREDULOUS KNEW NOT WHAT TO SUSPECT
NICER THAN WOMEN LABOURING UNDER SUCH A DELUSION WHY DO YOU NOT MARRY I SOMETIMES JOLLY WELL THINK I WOULD IF I GOT THE CHANCE HAS NOBODY ARST YOU ONLY NINNIES DO PEOPLE ASK HELEN PLENTIFULLY TELL ME ABOUT THEM
AND DARK BRIGHT PENETRATING EYES LOOKED ROUND WITH A SMILE AND SALUTED THE CARRIER'S WIFE BY GRAVELY INCLINING HIS HEAD HIS GARB WAS VERY QUAINT AND ODD A LONG LONG WAY BEHIND THE TIME ITS HUE WAS BROWN ALL OVER
ROUSE UP THAT'S MY HEARTY JOHN SAID THESE LATTER WORDS OUTSIDE THE DOOR WHITHER HE HAD HURRIED WITH THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND MISS SLOWBOY CONSCIOUS OF SOME MYSTERIOUS REFERENCE TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND CONNECTING IN HER MYSTIFIED IMAGINATION
AND STAMPED WITH A HUMAN FACE LONDON IS RELIGION'S OPPORTUNITY NOT THE DECOROUS RELIGION OF THEOLOGIANS BUT ANTHROPOMORPHIC CRUDE YES THE CONTINUOUS FLOW WOULD BE TOLERABLE IF A MAN OF OUR OWN SORT
A DESCRIPTION WHICH WILL EQUALLY APPLY TO HIS VOICE OR AT JOHN FOR ANOTHER SAID CALEB OR AT TILLY AS FAR AS THAT GOES OR CERTAINLY AT BOXER BUSY JUST NOW CALEB ASKED THE CARRIER WHY PRETTY WELL JOHN
ITS LITERATURE AND ART HAVE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL THE KINK OF THE UNSEEN ABOUT THEM AND THIS PERSISTS EVEN THROUGH DECADENCE AND AFFECTATION
THAT SHE CERTAINLY DID NOT FEEL SHE HAD KEPT HOUSE FOR OVER TEN YEARS SHE HAD ENTERTAINED ALMOST WITH DISTINCTION SHE HAD BROUGHT UP A CHARMING SISTER AND WAS BRINGING UP A BROTHER SURELY IF EXPERIENCE IS ATTAINABLE SHE HAD ATTAINED IT
WICKHAM PLACE HAD BEEN SO SAFE SHE FEARED FANTASTICALLY THAT HER OWN LITTLE FLOCK MIGHT BE MOVING INTO TURMOIL AND SQUALOR
MURMURED MARGARET PUTTING DOWN HER WORK I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS SO FUNNY HELEN IT MEANS SOME HORRIBLE VOLCANO SMOKING SOMEWHERE DOESN'T IT
AND WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN HER OWN VIEWS ONLY FEARED GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ACCOMPLISHING THEM THE FIRST HOPE OF ANYTHING BETTER WAS DERIVED FROM LADY SUSAN'S ASKING HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT FREDERICA LOOKED QUITE
CONCERTS AND PLAYS SWEPT PAST THEM MONEY HAD BEEN SPENT AND RENEWED REPUTATIONS WON AND LOST AND THE CITY HERSELF EMBLEMATIC OF THEIR LIVES ROSE AND FELL IN A CONTINUAL FLUX
INDEED THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MOST BEAUTIFUL VIEW MISS SCHLEGEL SO I SAY BUT HELEN WHO WILL MUDDLE THINGS SAYS NO IT'S LIKE MUSIC
AND SHE WAS A WISP OF HAY A FLOWER
AND A CHILL FELL ON THE CONVERSATION OH MISSUS WILCOX SAY SOMETHING NICER THAN THAT IT'S SUCH A SNUB TO BE TOLD YOU PUT THINGS SPLENDIDLY I DO NOT MEAN IT AS A SNUB
YET SHE AND DAILY LIFE WERE OUT OF FOCUS ONE OR THE OTHER MUST SHOW BLURRED AND AT LUNCH SHE SEEMED MORE OUT OF FOCUS THAN USUAL AND NEARER THE LINE THAT DIVIDES LIFE FROM A LIFE THAT MAY BE OF GREATER IMPORTANCE
SIR JAMES MAY SEEM TO HAVE DRAWN A HARDER LOT THAN MERE FOLLY MERITED I LEAVE HIM THEREFORE TO ALL THE PITY THAT ANYBODY CAN GIVE HIM FOR MYSELF I CONFESS THAT I CAN PITY ONLY MISS MAINWARING WHO
FOR WHO WOULD TAKE HER ASSURANCE OF IT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION THE WORLD MUST JUDGE FROM PROBABILITIES SHE HAD NOTHING AGAINST HER BUT HER HUSBAND AND HER CONSCIENCE
AND AM NOT PRETENDING
CLIPPED WORDS FORMLESS SENTENCES POTTED EXPRESSIONS OF APPROVAL OR DISGUST MONTH BY MONTH THINGS WERE STEPPING LIVELIER BUT TO WHAT GOAL THE POPULATION STILL ROSE BUT WHAT WAS THE QUALITY OF THE MEN BORN
NOT ANYONE POMPOUS OR TEARFUL WERE CARING FOR US UP IN THE SKY THE LONDONER SELDOM UNDERSTANDS HIS CITY UNTIL IT SWEEPS HIM TOO AWAY FROM HIS MOORINGS
I AM NOT SURE THAT I AGREE DO YOU SAID HE TURNING TO MISSUS WILCOX SHE REPLIED I THINK MISS SCHLEGEL PUTS EVERYTHING SPLENDIDLY
AND MARGARET'S EYES WERE NOT OPENED UNTIL THE LEASE OF WICKHAM PLACE EXPIRED SHE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT IT MUST EXPIRE BUT THE KNOWLEDGE ONLY BECAME VIVID ABOUT NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT
NEVER SAID MISSUS WILCOX GRAVELY
FOR WHEN HE TURNED TO SHUT THE DOOR AND KEEP THE WEATHER OUT HE DISCLOSED UPON THE BACK OF THAT GARMENT THE INSCRIPTION G AND T IN LARGE BLACK CAPITALS ALSO THE WORD GLASS IN BOLD CHARACTERS GOOD EVENING JOHN SAID THE LITTLE MAN
IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM SAID MISSUS WILCOX UNEXPECTEDLY CATCHING ON TO THE THOUGHT AND ROUSING FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME A FAINT HOPE IN THE BREASTS OF THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM AND I SOMETIMES THINK BUT
NOT TO BE MARRIED WAS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE OF THIS PROFOUND DESIRE TO WHICH YOU ALLUDE ENUNCIATED TIBBY
PEOPLE WILL THERE DISCUSS WITH HUMILITY VITAL QUESTIONS THAT WE HERE THINK OURSELVES TOO GOOD TO TOUCH WITH TONGS I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO PRUSSIAN SAID MISSUS WILCOX NOT EVEN TO SEE THAT INTERESTING VIEW THAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING
SOMEWHAT LESS FORMIDABLE THE LUCKY ALARM OF AN INFLUENZA DECIDED WHAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN DECIDED QUITE SO SOON LADY SUSAN'S MATERNAL FEARS WERE THEN TOO MUCH AWAKENED FOR HER TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT FREDERICA'S REMOVAL FROM THE RISK OF INFECTION
WAS THERE SUCH A THING AS STETTININITY MARGARET SWEPT ON PEOPLE AT STETTIN DROP THINGS INTO BOATS OUT OF OVERHANGING WAREHOUSES
SAID THE LITTLE MAN SPELLING OUT THE DIRECTION WITH CASH WITH CASH JOHN I DON'T THINK IT'S FOR ME WITH CARE RETURNED THE CARRIER LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER WHERE DO YOU MAKE OUT CASH
CERTAINLY LONDON FASCINATES ONE VISUALIZES IT AS A TRACT OF QUIVERING GREY INTELLIGENT WITHOUT PURPOSE AND EXCITABLE WITHOUT LOVE AS A SPIRIT THAT HAS ALTERED BEFORE IT CAN BE CHRONICLED
CONCLUDED BY DECLINING ENTIRELY TO PROFIT BY SUCH UNEXAMPLED ATTENTION MISSUS VERNON PERSEVERED HOWEVER IN THE OFFER OF IT AND THOUGH LADY SUSAN CONTINUED TO RESIST HER RESISTANCE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS SEEMED
IF YOU PLEASE I WAS TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR SAID THE STRANGER MILDLY DON'T MIND ME
IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GREAT BROWN CLUB OR WALKING STICK AND STRIKING THIS UPON THE FLOOR IT FELL ASUNDER AND BECAME A CHAIR ON WHICH HE SAT DOWN QUITE COMPOSEDLY THERE SAID THE CARRIER TURNING TO HIS WIFE
TO BE LIKE MUSIC IT'S OBLIGED TO REMIND HER OF A SYMPHONIC POEM
SUCH MEN GIVE ME MORE PLEASURE THAN MANY WHO ARE BETTER EQUIPPED AND I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE WORKED REGULARLY AND HONESTLY SPARE ME THE WILCOXES HE MOANED
CHAPTER NINE MISSUS WILCOX CANNOT BE ACCUSED OF GIVING MARGARET MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT LIFE AND MARGARET ON THE OTHER HAND HAS MADE A FAIR SHOW OF MODESTY AND HAS PRETENDED TO AN INEXPERIENCE
AND MONTH BY MONTH THE ROADS SMELT MORE STRONGLY OF PETROL AND WERE MORE DIFFICULT TO CROSS AND HUMAN BEINGS HEARD EACH OTHER SPEAK WITH GREATER DIFFICULTY BREATHED LESS OF THE AIR AND SAW LESS OF THE SKY NATURE WITHDREW
I HAVE LONG WANTED TO HEAR WHAT IS SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE THE OTHER SIDE THEN YOU DO DISAGREE OH GOOD GIVE US YOUR SIDE I HAVE NO SIDE BUT MY HUSBAND HER VOICE SOFTENED THE CHILL INCREASED
FOR THE FORMER SOON PERCEIVED BY THE STYLE OF FREDERICA'S LETTERS THAT THEY WERE WRITTEN UNDER HER MOTHER'S INSPECTION AND THEREFORE DEFERRING ALL PARTICULAR ENQUIRY TILL SHE COULD MAKE IT PERSONALLY IN LONDON CEASED WRITING MINUTELY
IT'S A BOX OF DOLLS EYES FOR MY DAUGHTERS WORK
BUT THE DEMON OF VOCIFERATION WAS IN HER AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS OFF AGAIN ONLY ON TUESDAY FOR THEY LIVE RIGHT AWAY AT STETTIN
WAS VERY READY TO OBLIGE THE WHOLE PARTY BY CONSENTING TO A PROLONGATION OF HER STAY AND IN THE COURSE OF TWO MONTHS CEASED TO WRITE OF HER ABSENCE AND IN THE COURSE OF TWO OR MORE TO WRITE TO HER AT ALL
AND I'M SURE I NEED ONLY LOOK AT YOU FOR ANOTHER SAID CALEB HE DIDN'T LOOK AT HER THOUGH HE HAD A WANDERING AND THOUGHTFUL EYE WHICH SEEMED TO BE ALWAYS PROJECTING ITSELF INTO SOME OTHER TIME AND PLACE NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID
OH MISSUS WILCOX YOU WOULD LOVE THE ODER THE RIVER OR RATHER RIVERS THERE SEEM TO BE DOZENS OF THEM ARE INTENSE BLUE AND THE PLAIN THEY RUN THROUGH AN INTENSEST GREEN
I LAUGHED AND WEPT I WAS SO HAPPY IN IT I READ THAT YOU WERE IN WARM LANDS WHERE THE COFFEE TREE GROWS
AND YOU CAN GET THE KEY IF YOU CHOOSE I SAID YES WHEN I AM UP STAIRS HE ANSWERED BUT I CAN'T WALK UP STAIRS NOW IN WHAT APARTMENT IS IT I ASKED OH HE CRIED I SHAN'T TELL YOU WHERE IT IS IT IS OUR SECRET
NONE COULD HAVE NOTICED THE EXACT MINUTE OF HIS DEATH IT WAS SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT A STRUGGLE WHETHER CATHERINE HAD SPENT HER TEARS OR WHETHER THE GRIEF WERE TOO WEIGHTY TO LET THEM FLOW SHE SAT THERE DRY EYED TILL THE SUN ROSE
SAT IN THE TREE NODDED TO BOTH OF THEM AND SAID TO DAY IS THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY AND THEN SHE TOOK TWO FLOWERS OUT OF HER HAIR AND KISSED THEM FIRST THEY SHONE LIKE SILVER THEN LIKE GOLD
THE COVER ROSE MORE AND MORE AND THE ELDER FLOWERS CAME FORTH SO FRESH AND WHITE AND SHOT UP LONG BRANCHES OUT OF THE SPOUT EVEN DID THEY SPREAD THEMSELVES ON ALL SIDES AND GREW LARGER AND LARGER
HE DID NOT KNOW IF HE HAD DREAMED OR NOT OR IF HE HAD BEEN LISTENING WHILE SOMEONE TOLD HIM THE STORY THE TEA POT WAS STANDING ON THE TABLE BUT NO ELDER TREE WAS GROWING OUT OF IT AND THE OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN TALKING
AND THAT TOO FOR MANY A YEAR A LONG WAY OFF ON GREAT VOYAGES
HER EYES WERE SO LARGE AND BLUE THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT THEM SHE KISSED THE BOY AND NOW THEY WERE OF THE SAME AGE AND FELT ALIKE HAND IN HAND THEY WENT OUT OF THE BOWER AND THEY WERE STANDING IN THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN OF THEIR HOME
AND HER MOUTH FILLING WITH BLOOD AND THEN SHE GATHERED UP
AND REMEMBRANCE NODDED AND THE OLD PEOPLE DECKED WITH CROWNS OF GOLD SAT IN THE FLUSH OF THE EVENING SUN THEY CLOSED THEIR EYES AND AND YES THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY THE LITTLE BOY LAY IN HIS BED
BUT I BESPOKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF IT MYSELF HOW CHANGED I FOUND HIM EVEN IN THOSE FEW DAYS HE LAY AN IMAGE OF SADNESS AND RESIGNATION AWAITING HIS DEATH VERY YOUNG HE LOOKED
IT WAS A SPLENDID ELDERBUSH A WHOLE TREE AND IT REACHED INTO THE VERY BED AND PUSHED THE CURTAINS ASIDE HOW IT BLOOMED AND WHAT AN ODOUR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUSH SAT A FRIENDLY LOOKING OLD WOMAN IN A MOST STRANGE DRESS
BUT NOW IT'S COMING THE MOST WONDERFUL FAIRY TALES GROW OUT OF THAT WHICH IS REALITY WERE THAT NOT THE CASE YOU KNOW MY MAGNIFICENT ELDERBUSH COULD NOT HAVE GROWN OUT OF THE TEA POT AND THEN SHE TOOK THE LITTLE BOY OUT OF BED LAID HIM ON HER BOSOM
YOU WHO HAVE FELT WHAT IT IS TO BE SO NEGLECTED YOU COULD PITY YOUR OWN SUFFERINGS AND SHE PITIED THEM TOO BUT YOU WON'T PITY HERS I SHED TEARS MASTER HEATHCLIFF YOU SEE AN ELDERLY WOMAN
IF I HAD BUT SOMETHING NEW TO TELL SAID THE OLD MAN BUT HOW DID THE CHILD GET HIS FEET WET THAT IS THE VERY THING THAT NOBODY CAN MAKE OUT SAID HIS MOTHER
ZILLAH NO NO SIT YOU DOWN MY GOOD MISTRESS SHE REPLIED YOU'RE RIGHT SICKLY YET HE'S NOT DEAD
AND SHE TUCKED HIM UP NICELY LEAST HE SHOULD TAKE COLD
SHE WEPT TO MISS ONE EVENING BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED AND YOU FELT THEN THAT SHE WAS A HUNDRED TIMES TOO GOOD TO YOU AND NOW YOU BELIEVE THE LIES YOUR FATHER TELLS THOUGH YOU KNOW HE DETESTS YOU BOTH AND YOU JOIN HIM AGAINST HER THAT'S FINE GRATITUDE IS IT NOT
AND THE MORE HE LOOKED AT IT THE FRESHER IT BECAME
SUCKING A STICK OF SUGAR CANDY AND PURSUING MY MOVEMENTS WITH APATHETIC EYES WHERE IS MISS CATHERINE I DEMANDED STERNLY SUPPOSING I COULD FRIGHTEN HIM INTO GIVING INTELLIGENCE BY CATCHING HIM THUS ALONE HE SUCKED ON LIKE AN INNOCENT IS SHE GONE I SAID
THUS PASSED MANY YEARS AND HE WAS NOW AN OLD MAN AND SAT WITH HIS OLD WIFE UNDER THE BLOOMING TREE THEY HELD EACH OTHER BY THE HAND AS THE OLD GRAND FATHER AND GRAND MOTHER YONDER IN THE NEW BOOTHS DID
THEY WENT HAND IN HAND AS THE OLD PEOPLE HAD DONE WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN BUT NOT TO THE ROUND TOWER OR TO FRIEDERICKSBERG NO THE LITTLE DAMSEL WOUND HER ARMS ROUND THE BOY AND THEN THEY FLEW FAR AWAY THROUGH ALL DENMARK AND SPRING CAME AND SUMMER
FORTUNATELY NO THOUGHT OF WORLDLY AFFAIRS CROSSED THE LATTER'S MIND TO DISTURB HIM AFTER HIS DAUGHTER'S ARRIVAL MISTER GREEN TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO ORDER EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY ABOUT THE PLACE HE GAVE ALL THE SERVANTS BUT ME NOTICE TO QUIT
AND WHERE THE HALF NAKED MEN ARE BANGING WITH THEIR HAMMERS TILL THE SPARKS FLY ABOUT AWAY AWAY TO THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY SEAT
I TREMBLED AT THE FIRST EFFECTS OF THIS INTELLIGENCE HE HALF ROSE UP LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND THE APARTMENT AND THEN SANK BACK IN A SWOON AS SOON AS HE RECOVERED I RELATED OUR COMPULSORY VISIT AND DETENTION AT THE HEIGHTS
HE HAD GONE OUT AND GOT HIS FEET WET
AND WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO BED HE BEGGED TO SLEEP WITH HARETON AND HIS PETITION WAS GRANTED FOR ONCE CATHERINE STOLE OUT BEFORE BREAK OF DAY SHE DARED NOT TRY THE DOORS LEST THE DOGS SHOULD RAISE AN ALARM SHE VISITED THE EMPTY CHAMBERS AND EXAMINED THEIR WINDOWS
AND THEY STOOD IN A BEECH WOOD THAT HAD JUST PUT ON ITS FIRST GREEN WHERE THE WOODROOF AT THEIR FEET SENT FORTH ITS FRAGRANCE
TO BE SURE SAID HE AND THERE IN THE CORNER STOOD A WATERPAIL WHERE I USED TO SWIM MY BOATS TRUE BUT FIRST WE WENT TO SCHOOL TO LEARN SOMEWHAT SAID SHE AND THEN WE WERE CONFIRMED
AND THEY TALKED EXACTLY LIKE THEM OF OLD TIMES AND OF THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR WEDDING
DID SHE COME TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS BECAUSE SHE HATED YOU I CONTINUED THINK FOR YOURSELF
AND THE BRANCHES OF THE ELDER TREE FULL OF FLOWERS CLOSED AROUND HER THEY SAT IN AN AERIAL DWELLING AND IT FLEW WITH THEM THROUGH THE AIR OH IT WAS WONDROUS BEAUTIFUL OLD NANNY HAD GROWN ALL OF A SUDDEN A YOUNG AND PRETTY MAIDEN
BUT AT HIS DEPARTURE THE LITTLE MAIDEN TOOK AN ELDER BLOSSOM FROM HER BOSOM AND GAVE IT HIM TO KEEP AND IT WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF HIS PRAYER BOOK AND WHEN IN FOREIGN LANDS HE OPENED THE BOOK IT WAS ALWAYS AT THE PLACE WHERE THE KEEPSAKE FLOWER LAY
MANY A NIGHT HAVE I GOT UP TO SEE IF THE WIND HAD NOT CHANGED AND CHANGED IT HAD SURE ENOUGH BUT YOU NEVER CAME I REMEMBER SO WELL ONE DAY WHEN THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN IN TORRENTS THE SCAVENGERS WERE BEFORE THE HOUSE WHERE I WAS IN SERVICE
WON'T THERE BE A TAP SOON ASKED THE LITTLE BOY
HE WOULD HAVE CARRIED HIS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE POINT OF INSISTING THAT EDGAR LINTON SHOULD NOT BE BURIED BESIDE HIS WIFE BUT IN THE CHAPEL WITH HIS FAMILY THERE WAS THE WILL HOWEVER TO HINDER THAT
HAVING RECEIVED HIS ORDERS I DESPATCHED A MAN TO FETCH THE ATTORNEY AND FOUR MORE PROVIDED WITH SERVICEABLE WEAPONS TO DEMAND MY YOUNG LADY OF HER JAILOR BOTH PARTIES WERE DELAYED VERY LATE THE SINGLE SERVANT RETURNED FIRST HE SAID MISTER GREEN THE LAWYER
DIRECT ME TO HER ROOM IMMEDIATELY OR I'LL MAKE YOU SING OUT SHARPLY PAPA WOULD MAKE YOU SING OUT IF YOU ATTEMPTED TO GET THERE HE ANSWERED HE SAYS I'M NOT TO BE SOFT WITH CATHERINE SHE'S MY WIFE
SO HIS MOTHER UNDRESSED HIM PUT HIM TO BED AND HAD THE TEA POT BROUGHT IN TO MAKE HIM A GOOD CUP OF ELDERFLOWER TEA JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE MERRY OLD MAN CAME IN WHO LIVED UP A TOP OF THE HOUSE ALL ALONE FOR HE HAD NEITHER WIFE NOR CHILDREN BUT HE LIKED CHILDREN VERY MUCH
I CAN REMEMBER I CAN TELL THINGS LET ME SEE IF YOU HAVE MY FLOWER STILL AND THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS PRAYER BOOK THERE LAY THE ELDER BLOSSOM AS FRESH AS IF IT HAD BEEN PLACED THERE BUT A SHORT TIME BEFORE
YOU ARRIVED AS SOON AS YOUR LETTER AND YOU WERE SO HANDSOME THAT YOU STILL ARE AND HAD A LONG YELLOW SILK HANDKERCHIEF ROUND YOUR NECK AND A BRAN NEW HAT ON OH YOU WERE SO DASHING GOOD HEAVENS WHAT WEATHER IT WAS AND WHAT A STATE THE STREET WAS IN
AND ONE FALLING STAR AFTER THE OTHER WAS SEEN IN THE SKY THE CHRISTMAS TREE WAS LIGHTED IN THE ROOM PRESENTS WERE THERE AND GOOD HUMOR REIGNED IN THE COUNTRY THE VIOLIN SOUNDED IN THE ROOM OF THE PEASANT THE NEWLY BAKED CAKES WERE ATTACKED EVEN THE POOREST CHILD SAID
SHE GOT EASILY OUT OF ITS LATTICE AND ON TO THE GROUND BY MEANS OF THE FIR TREE CLOSE BY
SHE SAT TILL NOON AND WOULD STILL HAVE REMAINED BROODING OVER THAT DEATHBED BUT I INSISTED ON HER COMING AWAY AND TAKING SOME REPOSE IT WAS WELL I SUCCEEDED IN REMOVING HER
AND I HAD COME UP WITH THE DUST AND REMAINED STANDING AT THE DOOR IT WAS DREADFUL WEATHER WHEN JUST AS I WAS THERE THE POSTMAN CAME AND GAVE ME A LETTER IT WAS FROM YOU WHAT A TOUR THAT LETTER HAD MADE I OPENED IT INSTANTLY AND READ
I'M GLAD FOR I SHALL BE MASTER OF THE GRANGE AFTER HIM CATHERINE ALWAYS SPOKE OF IT AS HER HOUSE IT ISN'T HERS IT'S MINE PAPA SAYS EVERYTHING SHE HAS IS MINE ALL HER NICE BOOKS ARE MINE SHE OFFERED TO GIVE ME THEM AND HER PRETTY BIRDS AND HER PONY MINNY
I WINK TO SEE MY FATHER STRIKE A DOG OR A HORSE HE DOES IT SO HARD YET I WAS GLAD AT FIRST SHE DESERVED PUNISHING FOR PUSHING ME BUT WHEN PAPA WAS GONE
IF I WOULD GET THE KEY OF OUR ROOM AND LET HER OUT BUT I TOLD HER SHE HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEY WERE ALL ALL MINE AND THEN SHE CRIED AND TOOK A LITTLE PICTURE FROM HER NECK AND SAID I SHOULD HAVE THAT TWO PICTURES IN A GOLD CASE
SHE HEARD PAPA COMING AND SHE BROKE THE HINGES AND DIVIDED THE CASE AND GAVE ME HER MOTHER'S PORTRAIT THE OTHER SHE ATTEMPTED TO HIDE BUT PAPA ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND I EXPLAINED IT HE TOOK THE ONE I HAD AWAY AND ORDERED HER TO RESIGN HERS TO ME
AND THOSE PARTS THAT WERE LIKE IT PLEASED THEM BEST THUS IT IS SAID THE LITTLE MAIDEN IN THE TREE SOME CALL ME OLD NANNY OTHERS A DRYAD BUT IN REALITY MY NAME IS REMEMBRANCE TIS I WHO SIT IN THE TREE THAT GROWS AND GROWS
BUT THEY COULD NOT EXACTLY RECOLLECT THE DATE AND OLD GRANNY SAT IN THE TREE AND LOOKED AS PLEASED AS NOW I KNOW THE DATE SAID SHE
AND THE COCK IS SCRAPING AWAY THE EARTH FOR THE HENS LOOK HOW HE STRUTS AND NOW WE ARE CLOSE TO THE CHURCH IT LIES HIGH UPON THE HILL BETWEEN THE LARGE OAK TREES ONE OF WHICH IS HALF DECAYED AND NOW WE ARE BY THE SMITHY WHERE THE FIRE IS BLAZING
AND HE DID GO HOW SPLENDID THAT WAS SAID THE LITTLE BOY MOTHER I HAVE BEEN TO WARM COUNTRIES SO I SHOULD THINK SAID HIS MOTHER WHEN ONE HAS DRUNK TWO GOOD CUPFULS OF ELDER FLOWER TEA TIS LIKELY ENOUGH ONE GOES INTO WARM CLIMATES
THEY BROUGHT WORD THAT CATHERINE WAS ILL TOO ILL TO QUIT HER ROOM AND HEATHCLIFF WOULD NOT SUFFER THEM TO SEE HER I SCOLDED THE STUPID FELLOWS WELL FOR LISTENING TO THAT TALE WHICH I WOULD NOT CARRY TO MY MASTER RESOLVING TO TAKE A WHOLE BEVY UP TO THE HEIGHTS AT DAY LIGHT
THE BOY SAW IT ALL AND YET THEY WERE ONLY GOING ROUND THE GRASS PLOT THEN THEY PLAYED IN A SIDE AVENUE AND MARKED OUT A LITTLE GARDEN ON THE EARTH AND THEY TOOK ELDER BLOSSOMS FROM THEIR HAIR PLANTED THEM AND THEY GREW JUST LIKE THOSE THE OLD PEOPLE PLANTED WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN AS RELATED BEFORE
I REMEMBER IT WELL SAID THE OLD WOMAN I REMEMBER IT QUITE WELL WE WATERED THE SLIPS AND ONE OF THEM WAS AN ELDERBUSH IT TOOK ROOT
AND CALLED OUT QUITE DELIGHTED THAT THERE WAS TO BE SOMETHING VERY SPLENDID THAT EVENING
HE SAYS SHE HATES ME AND WANTS ME TO DIE THAT SHE MAY HAVE MY MONEY BUT SHE SHAN'T HAVE IT AND SHE SHAN'T GO HOME SHE NEVER SHALL SHE MAY CRY AND BE SICK AS MUCH AS SHE PLEASES HE RESUMED HIS FORMER OCCUPATION CLOSING HIS LIDS AS IF HE MEANT TO DROP ASLEEP
THOUGH HIS ACTUAL AGE WAS THIRTY NINE ONE WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM TEN YEARS YOUNGER AT LEAST HE THOUGHT OF CATHERINE FOR HE MURMURED HER NAME I TOUCHED HIS HAND AND SPOKE CATHERINE IS COMING DEAR MASTER I WHISPERED SHE IS ALIVE AND WELL AND WILL BE HERE I HOPE TO NIGHT
IT WAS NOT THE ATTORNEY MY OWN SWEET LITTLE MISTRESS SPRANG ON MY NECK SOBBING ELLEN ELLEN IS PAPA ALIVE YES I CRIED YES MY ANGEL HE IS GOD BE THANKED YOU ARE SAFE WITH US AGAIN
THE SEA WAS DARK BLUE COVERED WITH SHIPS FULL OF WHITE SAILS AND IN THE BARN OLD WOMEN MAIDENS AND CHILDREN WERE SITTING PICKING HOPS INTO A LARGE CASK THE YOUNG SANG SONGS BUT THE OLD TOLD FAIRY TALES OF MOUNTAIN SPRITES AND SOOTHSAYERS
IT WAS QUITE GREEN LIKE THE LEAVES OF THE ELDER AND WAS TRIMMED WITH LARGE WHITE ELDER FLOWERS SO THAT AT FIRST ONE COULD NOT TELL WHETHER IT WAS A STUFF OR A NATURAL GREEN AND REAL FLOWERS
I CONSIDERED IT BEST TO DEPART WITHOUT SEEING MISTER HEATHCLIFF AND BRING A RESCUE FOR MY YOUNG LADY FROM THE GRANGE
AND KNEW SO MANY FAIRY TALES THAT IT WAS QUITE DELIGHTFUL
BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE UP FOR IT TO MORROW SAID THE STORY GIRL ENERGETICALLY IN FACT I'LL BEGIN TO NIGHT I'M GOING TO THE PANTRY AS SOON AS I GET HOME AND I'LL READ FATHER'S LETTER BEFORE I GO TO BED WASN'T THE MISSIONARY SPLENDID THAT CANNIBAL STORY WAS SIMPLY GRAND
AND WE ATE WHAT SEEMED GOOD UNTO US SOME OF US HAD FRIGHTFUL DREAMS AND ALL OF US CARRIED CHIPS ON OUR SHOULDERS AT BREAKFAST FELICITY AND DAN BEGAN A BICKERING WHICH THEY KEPT UP THE ENTIRE DAY FELICITY HAD A NATURAL APTITUDE FOR WHAT WE CALLED BOSSING
THAT WE DID NOT WONDER IN THE LEAST AT THE KING'S LOVE FOR HER I HAD READ THE STORY BEFORE AND IT HAD BEEN MY OPINION THAT IT WAS ROT NO KING I FELT CERTAIN WOULD EVER MARRY A BEGGAR MAID WHEN HE HAD PRINCESSES GALORE FROM WHOM TO CHOOSE
I'LL TELL YOU SAID PETER I'LL PICK UP A LOT OF THOSE LITTLE ROUND PEBBLES ON MISTER KING'S FRONT WALK
I DO SAID THE STORY GIRL SAGELY WHEN NEXT WE ASSEMBLED OURSELVES TOGETHER IT WAS AFTER MILKING AND THE CARES OF THE DAY WERE DONE WITH WE FOREGATHERED IN THE BALSAM FRAGRANT AISLES OF THE FIR WOOD
UNCLE ROGER WHO HAD BEEN SUMMONED FROM HIS OWN PLACE WENT AT ONCE FOR THE DOCTOR TELLING PETER TO GO DOWN THE HILL FOR MISSUS RAY PETER WENT BUT RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY SARA ONLY MISSUS RAY AND JUDY PINEAU WERE BOTH AWAY
NOT IF YOU DON'T GO TOO FAR WITH YOUR NONSENSE SHE SAID TOLERANTLY THANK YOU
GIVE HIM COURAGE NOT TO FEAR THE FACE OF MAN
I WISH MA HAD NEVER GONE AWAY I WISH YOU'D LEAVE FELICITY ALONE DAN I WISH GIRLS HAD SOME SENSE SAID DAN WHICH BROUGHT THE ORGY OF WISHING TO AN END FOR THE TIME
IN WHICH NOBLE AMBITION HE SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY
HE DIDN'T THINK SO BUT THE PRESBYTERY HAD THEIR WAY BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM TO ONE OF HIM HE WAS RETIRED AND A YOUNG MAN WAS CALLED TO CARLISLE MISTER SCOTT WENT TO LIVE IN TOWN BUT HE CAME OUT TO CARLISLE VERY OFTEN
BUT NOTHING OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY WHEN AN HOUR HAD PASSED WE CONCLUDED THAT THE BAD BERRIES WERE NOT POISON AFTER ALL AND WE LOOKED UPON DAN AS QUITE A HERO FOR DARING TO EAT THEM
I MUST HEAR THAT MISSIONARY SPEAK
THE BEAUTY OF PENANCE IS THAT IT MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU DO WHETHER IT'S USEFUL OR NOT SO LONG AS IT'S NASTY OH I WONDER HOW SARA IS THIS MORNING MOTHER'S GOING DOWN THIS AFTERNOON SAID FELICITY
AND VISITED ALL THE PEOPLE REGULARLY JUST THE SAME AS WHEN HE WAS THEIR MINISTER THE YOUNG MINISTER WAS A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN
AND IN HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE SHE DEEMED THAT SHE HAD A RIGHT TO RULE SUPREME SHE KNEW BETTER THAN TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO ASSERT AUTHORITY OVER THE STORY GIRL AND FELIX AND I WERE ALLOWED SOME LENGTH OF TETHER BUT CECILY DAN AND PETER WERE EXPECTED TO SUBMIT
BUT NOW I UNDERSTOOD IT ALL WHEN FELICITY RETURNED WE CONCLUDED FROM HER EXPRESSION THAT SHE HAD NEWS AND SHE HAD SARA IS REAL SICK SHE SAID WITH REGRET AND SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT REGRET MINGLED IN HER VOICE
WELL WE HAVEN'T ANY ANYHOW SAID FELICITY I SUPPOSE BLUEBERRY WINE WOULDN'T DO IN ITS PLACE
WITHOUT YOUR DOING ANYTHING SAID CECILY WELL MY CONSCIENCE WILL FEEL BETTER I DON'T BELIEVE PRESBYTERIANS EVER DO PENANCE SAID FELICITY DUBIOUSLY I NEVER HEARD OF ONE DOING IT BUT THE REST OF US RATHER LOOKED WITH FAVOUR ON THE STORY GIRL'S IDEA
SHE SAID I HEARD UNCLE EDWARD TELLING EVER SO MANY STORIES ABOUT HIM HE WAS CALLED TO THIS CONGREGATION AND HE LABOURED HERE LONG AND FAITHFULLY AND WAS MUCH BELOVED THOUGH HE WAS VERY ECCENTRIC WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ASKED PETER HUSH
PAT CAME OVER BUT HIS MOST SEDUCTIVE PURRS WON NO NOTICE FROM HIS MISTRESS WHO REFUSED HERSELF THE PLEASURE OF EVEN PATTING HIM AUNT JANET COULD NOT GO DOWN THE HILL IN THE AFTERNOON TO FIND OUT HOW SARA WAS BECAUSE COMPANY CAME TO TEA
I'M NOT GOING TO EAT A SINGLE THING ALL DAY EXCEPT BREAD AND WATER AND NOT MUCH OF THAT
HER ASCETIC FARE WAS REALLY SWEETER TO HER THAN HONEY OF HYMETTUS SHE WAS THOUGH QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY ACTING A PART AND TASTING ALL THE SUBTLE JOY OF THE ARTIST WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE EXQUISITE THAN ANY MATERIAL PLEASURE
IF THAT'S WHERE MY STOMACH IS MOANED DAN PUTTING HIS HAND ON A PORTION OF HIS ANATOMY CONSIDERABLY BELOW HIS STOMACH OH OH OH GO FOR UNCLE ROGER COMMANDED CECILY PALE BUT COMPOSED
WILLIAM IS A MAN'S NAME AND MEN ARE NEVER SWEET
BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THE OLD MINISTER WAS VERY ANGRY AT BEING SET ASIDE AND WOULD LIKELY GIVE HIM A SOUND DRUBBING IF HE EVER MET HIM ONE DAY THE YOUNG MINISTER WAS VISITING THE CRAWFORDS IN MARKDALE WHEN THEY SUDDENLY HEARD OLD MISTER SCOTT'S VOICE IN THE KITCHEN
WRINGING HER HANDS AS SHE WALKED THE KITCHEN FLOOR OH WHY DOESN'T THE DOCTOR COME I TOLD DAN THE BAD BERRIES WERE POISON BUT SURELY THEY CAN'T KILL PEOPLE ALTOGETHER PA'S COUSIN DIED OF EATING SOMETHING FORTY YEARS AGO SOBBED SARA RAY
SARA MIGHT BETTER HAVE STAYED HOME SHE WAS OF NO USE AND COULD ONLY ADD TO THE GENERAL CONFUSION WANDERING AIMLESSLY ABOUT CRYING AND ASKING IF DAN WAS GOING TO DIE
THE STORY GIRL HAD NOT RECOVERED FROM THE MORTIFICATIONS OF THE PREVIOUS DAY SHE WOULD NOT TALK AND SHE WOULD NOT TELL A SINGLE STORY SHE SAT ON RACHEL WARD'S CHEST AND ATE HER BREAKFAST WITH THE AIR OF A MARTYR AFTER BREAKFAST SHE WASHED THE DISHES
JUST THINK HOW MANY NEW STORIES I'D HAVE TO TELL AFTER I'D HEARD HIM NO I MUST GO BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO I'LL WEAR MY SCHOOL DRESS AND HAT THAT WILL BE PENANCE FELICITY WHEN YOU SET THE TABLE FOR DINNER PUT THE BROKEN HANDLED KNIFE FOR ME I HATE IT SO
NOBODY EVER KNEW THEY SUPPOSED HE HAD SEEN HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW BEFORE HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE
SHE SAYS NONE OF US MUST GO NEAR THE PLACE TILL WE KNOW WHETHER IT IS THE MEASLES OR NOT I'VE THOUGHT OF A GREAT PENANCE SAID CECILY EAGERLY DON'T GO TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING TO NIGHT THE STORY GIRL LOOKED PITEOUS
AND EATING ONLY BREAD AND WATER BEFORE THE CRITICAL MILLWARDS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVE BLISS TO HER WHEN WE WENT TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING THAT EVENING
DAN CRAMMED THE WHOLE BUNCH INTO HIS CAPACIOUS MOUTH AND CHEWED IT UP THEY TASTE GREAT HE SAID SMACKING AND HE ATE TWO MORE CLUSTERS REGARDLESS OF OUR HORROR STRICKEN PROTESTATIONS AND FELICITY'S PLEADINGS WE FEARED THAT DAN WOULD DROP DEAD ON THE SPOT
IF THEY DON'T DIE COMPLETELY OF THEM IT LEAVES THEM DEAF
AND SO TOOK UP LESS ROOM DURING THE DISCUSSION WE CAME OUT TO THE FENCE OF THE HILL PASTURE WHERE GREW THE BAD BERRY BUSHES JUST WHAT THESE BAD BERRIES WERE I CANNOT TELL WE NEVER KNEW THEIR REAL NAME
WHEN YOUR FATHER'S RUN AWAY AND YOUR MOTHER GOES OUT WASHING AND YOU'RE ONLY OLD ENOUGH TO GET FIFTY CENTS A WEEK YOU CAN'T GIVE MUCH TO THE HEATHEN BUT I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN MY AUNT JANE WAS FOND OF MISSIONS
TO SIT DOWN TO ONE OF AUNT JANET'S MEALS IN ORDINARY HEALTH AND APPETITE AND EAT NOTHING BUT BREAD AND WATER THAT WOULD BE PENANCE WITH A VENGEANCE WE FELT WE COULD NEVER DO IT BUT THE STORY GIRL DID IT WE ADMIRED AND PITIED HER
FELICITY MIGHT CHARM THE PALATE AND THE STORY GIRL BIND CAPTIVE THE SOUL BUT WHEN PAIN AND SICKNESS WRUNG THE BROW IT WAS CECILY WHO WAS THE MINISTERING ANGEL SHE MADE THE WRITHING DAN GO TO BED
BUT SHE COULDN'T GET HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND ALL SHE COULD DO WAS TO HIDE HIM IN THE CHINA CLOSET THE YOUNG MINISTER SLIPPED INTO THE CHINA CLOSET AND OLD MISTER SCOTT CAME INTO THE ROOM HE TALKED VERY NICELY AND READ AND PRAYED
I'M GOING TO DO PENANCE ALL DAY FOR COAXING SARA TO DISOBEY HER MOTHER SHE ANNOUNCED WITH CHASTENED TRIUMPH PENANCE WE MURMURED IN BEWILDERMENT YES I'M GOING TO DENY MYSELF EVERYTHING I LIKE
DETERMINED TO START ONE I DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO FEEL AS INT'RESTED IN MISSIONARIES AS YOU FOLKS DO HE SAID BUT MAYBE IF I BEGIN TO GIVE SOMETHING I'LL GET INT'RESTED I'LL WANT TO KNOW HOW MY MONEY'S BEING SPENT I WON'T BE ABLE TO GIVE MUCH
YOU'LL DO NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID AUNT JANET SARA MUST NOT DO PENANCE IN THAT WAY SHE WOULD WEAR HOLES IN HER STOCKINGS AND MIGHT SERIOUSLY BRUISE HER FEET WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOOK A WHIP AND WHIPPED MY BARE SHOULDERS TILL THE BLOOD CAME
MISTER SCOTT PLANTED THE YELLOW PLUM TREE IN GRANDFATHER'S TIME SAID CECILY PEELING ONE OF THE PLUMS AND WHEN HE DID IT HE SAID IT WAS AS CHRISTIAN AN ACT AS HE EVER DID I WONDER WHAT HE MEANT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING VERY CHRISTIAN ABOUT PLANTING A TREE
I NOTICED THAT DAN WAS RATHER PALE AND QUIET HE LAY DOWN ON THE KITCHEN SOFA
BY TEA TIME THINGS HAD BRIGHTENED UP THE RAIN HAD CEASED AND THE OLD LOW RAFTERED ROOM WAS FULL OF SUNSHINE WHICH DANCED ON THE SHINING DISHES OF THE DRESSER MADE MOSAICS ON THE FLOOR
DEMANDED THE STORY GIRL AGGRIEVED I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING RETORTED AUNT JANET
ALL DAY SHE SAT IN THE KITCHEN AND WORKED BUTTONHOLES SUBSISTING ON BREAD AND WATER AND MEXICAN TEA FELICITY DID A MEAN THING SHE WENT TO WORK AND MADE LITTLE RAISIN PIES RIGHT THERE IN THE KITCHEN BEFORE THE STORY GIRL
AND HE BEGAN THE DAY WITH A FLATLY EXPRESSED DETERMINATION THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO LET FELICITY RULE THE ROOST IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT DAY AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE IT RAINED UNTIL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
CAROUSING WITHOUT STINT ON RAISIN PIES AND UNCLE EDWARD'S CHERRIES BUT SHE WORKED ON AT HER BUTTONHOLES SHE WOULD NOT LOOK AT THE EXCITING SERIAL IN THE NEW MAGAZINE DAN BROUGHT HOME FROM THE POST OFFICE NEITHER WOULD SHE OPEN A LETTER FROM HER FATHER
CECILY'S HEADACHE WAS BETTER AND THE STORY GIRL REFRESHED BY AN AFTERNOON SIESTA CAME DOWN WITH SMILES AND SPARKLING EYES DAN ALONE CONTINUED TO NURSE HIS GRIEVANCES
EVEN CHILDREN CANNOT DEVOUR MINCE PIE AND COLD FRIED PORK HAM AND FRUIT CAKE BEFORE GOING TO BED WITH ENTIRE IMPUNITY AUNT JANET HAD FORGOTTEN TO WARN UNCLE ROGER TO KEEP AN EYE ON OUR BEDTIME SNACKS
AND I'M GOING TO TAKE A DOSE OF MEXICAN TEA EVERY TWO HOURS IT'S SUCH DREADFUL TASTING STUFF BUT IT'S A GOOD BLOOD PURIFIER SO AUNT JANET CAN'T OBJECT TO IT THE STORY GIRL CARRIED OUT HER SELF IMPOSED PENANCE FULLY
SHUT UP HE SAID I SHUT UP FELICITY AND CECILY WERE SETTING OUT A LUNCH IN THE PANTRY WHEN WE WERE ALL STARTLED BY A LOUD GROAN FROM THE SOFA
IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK BEFORE DAN BEGAN TO GET BETTER BUT FROM THAT TIME HE IMPROVED RAPIDLY WHEN THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HOME WHEN UNCLE ROGER REACHED MARKDALE CAME AT HALF PAST TEN HE FOUND HIS PATIENT VERY WEAK AND WHITE BUT FREE FROM PAIN
AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK WE GASPED SHE HAD COMBED HER HAIR OUT STRAIGHT AND BRAIDED IT IN A TIGHT KINKY PUDGY BRAID AND SHE WORE AN OLD DRESS OF FADED PRINT WITH HOLES IN THE ELBOWS AND RAGGED FLOUNCES WHICH WAS MUCH TOO SHORT FOR HER SARA STANLEY
FOR A SIN I COMMITTED I CAN'T CONFESS IT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BRING TROUBLE ON ANOTHER PERSON SO I'M GOING TO DO PENANCE ALL DAY YOU DON'T MIND DO YOU AUNT JANET WAS IN A VERY GOOD HUMOUR THAT MORNING SO SHE MERELY LAUGHED
AND ATE EARLY AUGUST APPLES TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE STORY GIRL SAID WE MADE HER THINK OF THE IRISHMAN'S PIG AN IRISHMAN WHO LIVED AT MARKDALE HAD A LITTLE PIG SHE SAID AND HE GAVE IT A PAILFUL OF MUSH
LISTENING TO THE STORY OF KING COPHETUA AND THE BEGGAR MAID ALL OF US EXCEPT PETER WHO WAS HOEING TURNIPS AND FELICITY WHO HAD GONE DOWN THE HILL ON AN ERRAND TO MISSUS RAY THE STORY GIRL IMPERSONATED THE BEGGAR MAID SO VIVIDLY AND WITH SUCH AN ILLUSION OF BEAUTY
THE SMELL OF RAISIN PIES IS SOMETHING TO TEMPT AN ANCHORITE AND THE STORY GIRL WAS EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF THEM FELICITY ATE TWO IN HER VERY PRESENCE AND THEN BROUGHT THE REST OUT TO US IN THE ORCHARD THE STORY GIRL COULD SEE US THROUGH THE WINDOW
WE FELT SURE THAT SHE WOULD DO PENANCE AS PICTURESQUELY AND THOROUGHLY AS SHE DID EVERYTHING ELSE YOU MIGHT PUT PEAS IN YOUR SHOES YOU KNOW SUGGESTED PETER THE VERY THING I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT I'LL GET SOME AFTER BREAKFAST
AND FLICKERED OVER THE TABLE WHEREON A DELICIOUS MEAL WAS SPREAD FELICITY HAD PUT ON HER BLUE MUSLIN AND LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL IN IT THAT HER GOOD HUMOUR WAS QUITE RESTORED
WE ALL DECIDED TO INCREASE OUR WEEKLY CONTRIBUTION BY A CENT OR SO
FOR THE DISCUSSION OF AN INTERESTING FAMILY TOPIC THE LAST THREE WORDS DOUBLY UNDERLINED AND POINTED WITH A NOTE OF ADMIRATION AND TWEMLOW REPLYING NOT ENGAGED AND MORE THAN DELIGHTED
VENEERING WITH GREAT CONTEMPT AND WHAT DOES VENEERING KNOW ABOUT ME WAS HE NOT YOUR TRUSTEE NO I HAVE NO TRUSTEE BUT THE ONE YOU SAW ON THE DAY WHEN YOU FRAUDULENTLY MARRIED ME
I HAVE ORIGINATED NOTHING THE DOUBLE EDGED QUESTION WAS YOURS WAS MINE THE BRIDE REPEATS AND HER PARASOL BREAKS IN HER ANGRY HAND
AT LENGTH COMES TO BE EXPECTED BY THE COMPANY WHO MAKE EMBARRASSING PAUSES WHEN IT IS FALLING DUE AND BY WAITING FOR IT RENDER IT MORE EMPHATIC WHEN IT COMES THE STONEY AUNT HAS LIKEWISE AN INJURIOUS WAY OF REJECTING ALL DISHES WHEREOF LADY TIPPINS PARTAKES
BUT HERE COLLAPSES AND DOES NOT COMPLETELY RECOVER UNTIL DINNER IS OVER AND THE ANALYTICAL HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO WITHDRAW WE NOW COME SAYS VENEERING TO THE POINT THE REAL POINT OF OUR LITTLE FAMILY CONSULTATION SOPHRONIA
IN THE FRIENDLIEST MANNER HE IS MAKING HIMSELF QUITE AT HOME WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE EXECUTING A STATUETTE OF THE COLOSSUS AT RHODES TWEMLOW HAS BEFORE NOTICED IN HIS FEEBLE WAY HOW SOON THE VENEERING GUESTS BECOME INFECTED WITH THE VENEERING FICTION
IF YOU HAD WAITED A MOMENT YOU TOO ARE DISAPPOINTED AND CUT A POOR FIGURE AN INJURED FIGURE YOU ARE NOW COOL ENOUGH SOPHRONIA TO SEE THAT YOU CAN'T BE INJURED WITHOUT MY BEING EQUALLY INJURED AND THAT THEREFORE THE MERE WORD IS NOT TO THE PURPOSE
TO GIVE HIS MIND TO THE CARVING AND GILDING OF THE PILGRIMS GOING TO CANTERBURY IN ORDER TO SHOW TWEMLOW THE LITTLE FLOURISH HE HAS PREPARED FOR THE TRUMPETS OF FASHION DESCRIBING HOW THAT ON THE SEVENTEENTH INSTANT AT SAINT JAMES'S CHURCH THE REVEREND BLANK BLANK ASSISTED BY THE REVEREND DASH DASH
UNITED IN THE BONDS OF MATRIMONY ALFRED LAMMLE ESQUIRE OF SACKVILLE STREET PICCADILLY TO SOPHRONIA ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE LATE HORATIO AKERSHEM ESQUIRE OF YORKSHIRE ALSO HOW THE FAIR BRIDE WAS MARRIED FROM THE HOUSE OF HAMILTON VENEERING
WE AGREE TO KEEP OUR OWN SECRET AND TO WORK TOGETHER IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR OWN SCHEMES WHAT SCHEMES ANY SCHEME THAT WILL BRING US MONEY BY OUR OWN SCHEMES I MEAN OUR JOINT INTEREST AGREED
OSCILLATE ON MYSTERIOUS BUSINESS BETWEEN LONDON AND PARIS AND BE GREAT WHERE DOES HE COME FROM SHARES WHERE IS HE GOING TO SHARES WHAT ARE HIS TASTES SHARES HAS HE ANY PRINCIPLES SHARES
AND OMINOUS MARKS HAVE COME TO LIGHT ABOUT HIS NOSE AS IF THE FINGER OF THE VERY DEVIL HIMSELF HAD WITHIN THE LAST FEW MOMENTS TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE BUT HE HAS REPRESSIVE POWER AND SHE HAS NONE THROW IT AWAY HE COOLLY RECOMMENDS AS TO THE PARASOL
AND HAS DONE MUCH TO LURE THEM TO THE ALTAR
SO WE AGREE TO KEEP THE FACT TO OURSELVES YOU AGREE IF IT IS POSSIBLE I DO POSSIBLE
THAT THE LATTER IN THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR APPEARS TO BE CONTEMPLATING ALL THE WRONG HE WOULD LIKE TO DO PARTICULARLY TO THE PRESENT COMPANY IN WHICH STATE OF AFFAIRS THE USUAL CEREMONIES RATHER DROOP AND FLAG AND THE SPLENDID CAKE WHEN CUT BY THE FAIR HAND OF THE BRIDE
WITH A SMACK AND A RELISH
AGAIN THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUESTION MISSUS LAMMLE WHAT DO YOU PRETEND TO BELIEVE SO YOU FIRST DECEIVE ME AND THEN INSULT ME CRIES THE LADY WITH A HEAVING BOSOM
ON THE SANDS AT SHANKLIN IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT MISTER AND MISSUS LAMMLE HAVE WALKED FOR SOME TIME ON THE SHANKLIN SANDS AND ONE MAY SEE BY THEIR FOOTPRINTS THAT THEY HAVE NOT WALKED ARM IN ARM AND THAT THEY HAVE NOT WALKED IN A STRAIGHT TRACK
WHAT OF IT SAYS MISTER LAMMLE HAVE YOU THE FACE TO UTTER THE WORD TO ME THE FACE TOO REPLIED MISSUS LAMMLE STARING AT HIM WITH COLD SCORN PRAY HOW DARE YOU SIR UTTER THE WORD TO ME I NEVER DID
BE VENEERING'S OLDEST FRIENDS WARDS OF HIS PERHAPS YET THAT CAN SCARCELY BE FOR THEY ARE OLDER THAN HIMSELF
DON'T BE BETRAYED INTO DOING SO AGAIN BECAUSE I HAVE A DEVIL OF A TEMPER MYSELF SO THE HAPPY PAIR WITH THIS HOPEFUL MARRIAGE CONTRACT THUS SIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED REPAIR HOMEWARD
AND WHEN I LOOK BACK THE BRIDE CRIES INTERRUPTING AND WHEN YOU LOOK BACK YOU WONDER HOW YOU CAN HAVE BEEN YOU'LL EXCUSE THE WORD MOST CERTAINLY WITH SO MUCH REASON SUCH A FOOL AS TO TAKE ME
THIRTY SHILLINGS A YARD VEIL FIFTEEN POUND POCKET HANDKERCHIEF A PRESENT BRIDESMAIDS
WORN OUT BY WORRY AND EXCITEMENT AS SHE TELLS HER DEAR MISTER TWEMLOW
IS NOW AMONG US THAT FRIEND IS TWEMLOW CERTAINLY FROM PODSNAP THAT FRIEND VENEERING REPEATS WITH GREATER FIRMNESS IS OUR DEAR GOOD TWEMLOW
SHE BURSTS INTO TEARS DECLARING HERSELF THE WRETCHEDEST THE MOST DECEIVED THE WORST USED OF WOMEN THEN SHE SAYS THAT IF SHE HAD THE COURAGE TO KILL HERSELF SHE WOULD DO IT THEN SHE CALLS HIM VILE IMPOSTOR
CRYING ON A BLOCK OF STONE AND IS IN ALL THE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN HUMOURS OF HER SEX AT ONCE PENDING HER CHANGES THOSE AFORESAID MARKS IN HIS FACE HAVE COME AND GONE NOW HERE NOW THERE LIKE WHITE STEPS OF A PIPE ON WHICH THE DIABOLICAL PERFORMER HAS PLAYED A TUNE
MISTER LAMMLE TAKES HIS GINGEROUS WHISKERS IN HIS LEFT HAND AND BRINGING THEM TOGETHER FROWNS FURTIVELY AT HIS BELOVED OUT OF A THICK GINGEROUS BUSH DO I MEAN TO SAY
BROODING OVER THE FIRE WITH HIS DRIED LITTLE HEAD IN HIS DRIED LITTLE HANDS AND HIS DRIED LITTLE ELBOWS ON HIS DRIED LITTLE KNEES TWEMLOW IS MELANCHOLY NO ADORABLE TO BEAR ME COMPANY HERE THINKS HE NO ADORABLE AT THE CLUB
THE ANALYTICAL WHO OBJECTS AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE TO EVERYTHING THAT OCCURS ON THE PREMISES NECESSARILY OBJECTS TO THE MATCH BUT HIS CONSENT HAS BEEN DISPENSED WITH AND A SPRING VAN IS DELIVERING ITS LOAD OF GREENHOUSE PLANTS AT THE DOOR
AND A LITTLE MORE SILENCE MISTER LAMMLE BREAKS THE LATTER YOU SHALL PROCEED IN YOUR OWN WAY
AND OVER THE STABLE YARD IN DUKE STREET SAINT JAMES'S RECEIVED A HIGHLY PERFUMED COCKED HAT AND MONOGRAM FROM MISSUS VENEERING ENTREATING HER DEAREST MISTER T IF NOT PARTICULARLY ENGAGED THAT DAY TO COME LIKE A CHARMING SOUL AND MAKE A FOURTH AT DINNER WITH DEAR MISTER PODSNAP
TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT UPON TRUST BUT THE FOLLY IS COMMITTED ON BOTH SIDES I CANNOT GET RID OF YOU YOU CANNOT GET RID OF ME WHAT FOLLOWS SHAME AND MISERY THE BRIDE BITTERLY REPLIES I DON'T KNOW A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING FOLLOWS
NO THEN YOU MARRIED ME ON FALSE PRETENCES IF YOU WERE SO DULL A FORTUNE HUNTER THAT YOU DECEIVED YOURSELF OR IF YOU WERE SO GREEDY AND GRASPING THAT YOU WERE OVER WILLING TO BE DECEIVED BY APPEARANCES IS IT MY FAULT YOU ADVENTURER THE LADY DEMANDS WITH GREAT ASPERITY
AND I CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESS TO YOU MY DEAR PODSNAP THE PLEASURE I FEEL IN HAVING THIS OPINION OF MINE AND ANASTATIA'S SO READILY CONFIRMED BY YOU THAT OTHER EQUALLY FAMILIAR AND TRIED FRIEND WHO STANDS IN THE PROUD POSITION
CAN'T WE UNITED PRETEND TO THE WORLD AGREED SECONDLY WE OWE THE VENEERINGS A GRUDGE AND WE OWE ALL OTHER PEOPLE THE GRUDGE OF WISHING THEM TO BE TAKEN IN AS WE OURSELVES HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN AGREED YES AGREED
THAT THE POKEY UNKNOWNS SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN BEING UNIMPRESSIBLE THEY PERSIST IN NOT BEING FRIGHTENED BY THE GOLD AND SILVER CAMELS AND THEY ARE BANDED TOGETHER TO DEFY THE ELABORATELY CHASED ICE PAILS THEY EVEN SEEM TO UNITE IN SOME VAGUE UTTERANCE OF THE SENTIMENT
WE KNOW VERY WELL HOW IT WAS WHY SHOULD YOU AND I TALK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU AND I CAN'T DISGUISE IT TO PROCEED I AM DISAPPOINTED AND CUT A POOR FIGURE AM I NO ONE SOME ONE AND I WAS COMING TO YOU
ALSO HIS LIVID LIPS ARE PARTED AT LAST AS IF HE WERE BREATHLESS WITH RUNNING YET HE IS NOT NOW GET UP MISSUS LAMMLE AND LET US SPEAK REASONABLY SHE SITS UPON HER STONE AND TAKES NO HEED OF HIM GET UP I TELL YOU
AND THE TWO OTHER BUFFERS EACH BUFFER WITH A FLOWER IN HIS BUTTON HOLE HIS HAIR CURLED AND HIS GLOVES BUTTONED ON TIGHT APPARENTLY COME PREPARED
DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THEN SOPHRONIA
FOLLOWS EVERY LIVELY REMARK MADE BY THAT DEAR CREATURE WITH AN AUDIBLE SNORT WHICH MAY BE REFERABLE TO A CHRONIC COLD IN THE HEAD BUT MAY ALSO BE REFERABLE TO INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT
YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS WITH IT WHEREUPON SHE CALLS HIM IN HER RAGE A DELIBERATE VILLAIN AND SO CASTS THE BROKEN THING FROM HER AS THAT IT STRIKES HIM IN FALLING THE FINGER MARKS ARE SOMETHING WHITER FOR THE INSTANT BUT HE WALKS ON AT HER SIDE
GAVE AWAY ANYBODY ELSE FIRST HE WOULD NEVER GIVE AWAY BABY THUS MISSUS VENEERING WITH HER OPEN HANDS PRESSED TOGETHER AND EACH OF HER EIGHT AQUILINE FINGERS LOOKING SO VERY LIKE HER ONE AQUILINE NOSE THAT THE BRAN NEW JEWELS ON THEM SEEM NECESSARY FOR DISTINCTION'S SAKE
AND THAT THEY HAVE WALKED IN A MOODY HUMOUR FOR THE LADY HAS PRODDED LITTLE SPIRTING HOLES IN THE DAMP SAND BEFORE HER WITH HER PARASOL AND THE GENTLEMAN HAS TRAILED HIS STICK AFTER HIM
WHAT SQUEEZES HIM INTO PARLIAMENT SHARES PERHAPS HE NEVER OF HIMSELF ACHIEVED SUCCESS IN ANYTHING NEVER ORIGINATED ANYTHING NEVER PRODUCED ANYTHING SUFFICIENT ANSWER TO ALL SHARES O MIGHTY SHARES
IN A NUT SHELL THERE'S THE STATE OF THE CASE YOU SOUGHT ME OUT TUT
AND WHOSE LEFT HAND APPEARS TO BE IN A STATE OF ACUTE RHEUMATISM BUT IS IN FACT VOLUNTARILY DOUBLED UP TO ACT AS A MONEY BOX AND NOW VENEERING SHOOTS OUT OF THE STUDY WHEREIN HE IS ACCUSTOMED WHEN CONTEMPLATIVE
MISERABLE IS THAT THE WAY YOU DO YOUR DUTY BEYOND AN IMPRESSION THAT HE IS TO SIT UPON MY KNEE AND BE SECONDED AT SOME POINT OF THE SOLEMNITIES
AND EVEN THE UNKNOWNS ARE SLOWLY STRAINED OFF AND IT IS ALL OVER ALL OVER THAT IS TO SAY FOR THE TIME BEING BUT THERE IS ANOTHER TIME TO COME AND IT COMES IN ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AND IT COMES TO MISTER AND MISSUS LAMMLE
ANNOUNCES BREAKFAST DINING ROOM NO LESS MAGNIFICENT THAN DRAWING ROOM TABLES SUPERB ALL THE CAMELS OUT AND ALL LADEN SPLENDID CAKE COVERED WITH CUPIDS SILVER AND TRUE LOVERS KNOTS
MY DEAR TWEMLOW SAYS VENEERING YOUR READY RESPONSE TO ANASTATIA'S UNCEREMONIOUS INVITATION IS TRULY KIND AND LIKE AN OLD OLD FRIEND YOU KNOW OUR DEAR FRIEND PODSNAP TWEMLOW OUGHT TO KNOW THE DEAR FRIEND PODSNAP WHO COVERED HIM WITH SO MUCH CONFUSION
AS THIS HAPPENS TO BE TRUE MISSUS LAMMLE IS THROWN ON THE FEMININE RESOURCE OF SAYING I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU UTTERED OR DID NOT UTTER
AND HE SAYS HE DOES KNOW HIM AND PODSNAP RECIPROCATES APPARENTLY PODSNAP HAS BEEN SO WROUGHT UPON IN A SHORT TIME AS TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS BEEN INTIMATE IN THE HOUSE MANY MANY MANY YEARS
MORTIMER YOU WRETCH SAYS LADY TIPPINS TURNING THE EYEGLASS ABOUT AND ABOUT WHERE IS YOUR CHARGE THE BRIDEGROOM
IS PERHAPS KNOWN TO HER MAID BUT YOU COULD EASILY BUY ALL YOU SEE OF HER IN BOND STREET OR YOU MIGHT SCALP HER AND PEEL HER AND SCRAPE HER AND MAKE TWO LADY TIPPINSES OUT OF HER AND YET NOT PENETRATE TO THE GENUINE ARTICLE
TO SET THOSE BLARING IMAGES SO HIGH AND TO CAUSE US SMALLER VERMIN AS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HENBANE OR OPIUM TO CRY OUT NIGHT AND DAY RELIEVE US OF OUR MONEY SCATTER IT FOR US BUY US AND SELL US RUIN US ONLY WE BESEECH YE TAKE RANK AMONG THE POWERS OF THE EARTH AND FATTEN ON US
SHE HAS A LARGE GOLD EYE GLASS HAS LADY TIPPINS TO SURVEY THE PROCEEDINGS WITH IF SHE HAD ONE IN EACH EYE IT MIGHT KEEP THAT OTHER DROOPING LID UP AND LOOK MORE UNIFORM BUT PERENNIAL YOUTH IS IN HER ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS AND HER LIST OF LOVERS IS FULL
PUTTING IT ON ME THE UNMANLY DISINGENUOUSNESS MISTER LAMMLE STOPS RELEASES HIS WHISKERS AND LOOKS AT HER THE WHAT MISSUS LAMMLE HAUGHTILY REPLIES WITHOUT STOPPING AND WITHOUT LOOKING BACK THE MEANNESS
HAS BUT AN INDIGESTIBLE APPEARANCE HOWEVER ALL THE THINGS INDISPENSABLE TO BE SAID ARE SAID
AND A LOOK AT THE MARRIAGE SERVICE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY CUT IN AT THE RIGHT PLACE TO MORROW AND HE IS LOW AND FEELS IT DULL OVER THE LIVERY STABLE YARD AND IS DISTINCTLY AWARE OF A DINT IN HIS HEART MADE BY THE MOST ADORABLE OF THE ADORABLE BRIDESMAIDS
AND THAT HOT STONES MAY BE PICKED UP WHERE A LUMINOUS OBJECT SEEMINGLY HAD LANDED ONLY LIGHTNING STRIKING A STONE HEATING EVEN MELTING IT THE STONE OF LUCE SHOWED SIGNS OF FUSION
SO AUTHORITATIVELY FALLING STONES WERE DAMNED THE STOCK MEANS OF EXCLUSION REMAINED THE EXPLANATION OF LIGHTNING THAT WAS SEEN TO STRIKE SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE
IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE COMMON SENSE TO SAY THAT THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STATIONARY OVER THE TOWN OF BATH SEVERAL DAYS THE SEVEN BLACK RAINS OF SLAINS THE FOUR RED RAINS OF SIENA
FAR UP OR FAR AWAY THE WHOLE SKY IS GELATINOUS THAT METEORS TEAR THROUGH AND DETACH FRAGMENTS THAT FRAGMENTS ARE BROUGHT DOWN BY STORMS
OF OUTSIDE FORCES ONE MAY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF A LAVOISIER AND STILL NOT BE ABLE TO ANALYZE NOT BE ABLE EVEN TO SEE
BUT THE COMMON IMPRESSION OF THEM IS ONLY A RETREAT OF ATTEMPTED EXCLUSION THAT ONLY TWO KINDS OF SUBSTANCE FALL FROM THE SKY METALLIC AND STONY
OCCURS THE INEVITABLE DAMNATION OF THE AMHERST OBJECT PROFESSOR EDWARD HITCHCOCK WENT TO LIVE IN AMHERST
SO TO KNOW WAS CONVENIENT WHEN WE COME TO REPORTED FALLS OF GELATINOUS SUBSTANCES I'D LIKE IT TO BE NOTICED HOW OFTEN THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS WHITISH OR GRAYISH IN LOOKING UP THE SUBJECT MYSELF I HAVE READ ONLY
SCIENTISTS HAVE PERPETRATED SUCH AN ENORMITY AS SUSPENSION OF VOLCANIC DUST SEVEN YEARS IN THE AIR DISREGARDING THE LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS
IF INTRODUCED POLITELY HAILSTONES FOR INSTANCE ONE READS IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF HAILSTONES THE SIZE OF HENS EGGS ONE SMILES NEVERTHELESS I WILL ENGAGE TO LIST ONE HUNDRED INSTANCES FROM THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
TO ACCEPT CONNECTION OR THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST VAST GELATINOUS AREAS ALOFT AND THAT METEORITES TEAR THROUGH CARRYING DOWN SOME OF THE SUBSTANCE
AS LATE AS NOVEMBER NINETEEN O TWO
OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE TWO POUNDERS AUTHENTICATED AND SIX POUNDERS REPORTED AT SERINGAPATAM INDIA ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FELL A HAILSTONE
TO SEE THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC BUT HE HAD ALSO CALLED UPON DOCTOR HAMILTON WHO HAD A SPECIMEN AND DOCTOR HAMILTON HAD DECLARED IT TO BE LUNG TISSUE DOCTOR EDWARDS
BUT POSITIVENESS AND THE FATE OF EVERY POSITIVE STATEMENT IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO THINK OF DAMNED STONES RAISING AN OUTCRY AGAINST A SENTENCE OF EXCLUSION BUT SUBJECTIVELY
OF ABOUT THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF A TWENTY FIVE CENT PIECE THAT ACCORDING TO A COMMUNICATION FROM A C TWINING TO PROFESSOR OLMSTEAD A WOMAN AT WEST POINT NEW YORK
THE FALL OF A THOUSAND TONS OF BUTTER JET BLACK SNOW PINK SNOW BLUE HAILSTONES HAILSTONES FLAVORED LIKE ORANGES PUNK AND SILK AND CHARCOAL
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IF ANYONE WAS SO CREDULOUS AS TO THINK THAT STONES HAD EVER FALLEN FROM THE SKY HE WAS REASONED WITH IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE NO STONES IN THE SKY THEREFORE NO STONES CAN FALL FROM THE SKY
THE ARRIVAL OF DUST FROM SOMEWHERE BEYOND THIS EARTH NOT THAT SCIENTISTS THEMSELVES HAVE EVER ACHIEVED POSITIVENESS IN ITS ASPECT OF UNITEDNESS AMONG THEMSELVES BECAUSE NORDENSKIOLD
GRAYISH OR WHITISH GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE IS NOT NOSTOC AND IS NOT SPAWN IF OCCURRING IN TIMES UNSEASONABLE FOR SPAWN THE KENTUCKY PHENOMENON
BUT IN CONFORMITY WITH A GENERAL ATTEMPT TO HOLD OUT FOR ISOLATION OF THIS EARTH THIS IS ATTEMPTED POSITIVENESS WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT SCIENCE CAN NO MORE SUCCEED THAN
IT IS SAID THAT THESE PHENOMENA WERE CAUSED BY PARTICLES OF VOLCANIC DUST THAT WERE CAST HIGH IN THE AIR BY KRAKATOA THIS IS THE EXPLANATION THAT WAS AGREED UPON IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT FOR SEVEN YEARS THE ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA CONTINUED
IN THE TOPOGRAPHY OF INTELLECTION I SHOULD SAY THAT WHAT WE CALL KNOWLEDGE IS IGNORANCE SURROUNDED BY LAUGHTER BLACK RAINS RED RAINS
LUMPS OF JELLY WERE FOUND ON THE GROUND AT RAHWAY NEW JERSEY THE SUBSTANCE WAS WHITISH OR RESEMBLED THE COAGULATED WHITE OF AN EGG THAT MISTER H H GARLAND OF NELSON COUNTY VIRGINIA HAD FOUND A JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE
OR THE SPIRIT OR HOPE OR AMBITION OF THE COSMOS WHICH WE CALL ATTEMPTED POSITIVISM NOT TO FIND OUT THE NEW NOT TO ADD TO WHAT IS CALLED KNOWLEDGE BUT TO SYSTEMATIZE
ALMOST ALWAYS THE EXCLUSIONISTS ARGUE
AS IF THIS TIME FROG SPAWN DID FALL FROM THE SKY AND MAY HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED BY A WHIRLWIND BECAUSE
THAT THEY HAD SCATTERED THE DECAYING FLESH OF A DEAD HOG OVER THE TOBACCO FIELDS IF WE DON'T ACCEPT THIS DATUM
NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS WROTE BROADCAST AND WITNESSES WERE QUOTED AND THIS TIME THERE IS NO MENTION OF A HOAX AND EXCEPT BY ONE SCIENTIST
IT IS SAID THAT THE FISH WERE OF THE CHALWA SPECIES ABOUT A SPAN IN LENGTH AND A SEER IN WEIGHT YOU KNOW THEY WERE DEAD AND DRY OR
THE WRITER ABANDONS THE FIRST OR ABSOLUTE EXCLUSION AND MODIFIES IT WITH THE EXPLANATION THAT THE DAY BEFORE A REPORTED FALL OF STONES IN TUSCANY JUNE SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR THERE HAD BEEN AN ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS
WAS FOUND A SUBSTANCE UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE OBSERVED BY ANYONE WHO SAW IT IT WAS A BOWL SHAPED OBJECT ABOUT EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER AND ONE INCH THICK BRIGHT BUFF COLORED AND HAVING UPON IT A
A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE WAS FOUND
RAW MEAT SHOULD NOT BE FED TO BABIES WE SHALL HAVE A FEW DATA INITIATORILY I FEAR ME THAT THE HORSE AND THE BARN WERE A LITTLE EXTREME FOR OUR BUDDING LIBERALITIES THE OUTRAGEOUS IS THE REASONABLE
ONE SMILES IN MONTANA IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FELL SNOWFLAKES FIFTEEN INCHES ACROSS AND EIGHT INCHES THICK MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW NINETEEN FIFTEEN SEVENTY THREE
AS MUCH AS IT CAN EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH THIS BOOK IS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF DATA OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT OUR DATA HAVE BEEN DAMNED UPON NO CONSIDERATION FOR INDIVIDUAL MERITS OR DEMERITS
THESE DATA ARE SO IMPROPER THEY'RE OBSCENE TO THE SCIENCE OF TODAY BUT WE SHALL SEE THAT SCIENCE
THAT HAS EVER BEEN ACCEPTABLY TRACED TO TERRESTRIAL ORIGIN FALLING STONES HAD TO BE UNDAMNED
SEEMS TO PARTAKE SO MUCH OF THE MARVELOUS AS ALMOST ENTIRELY TO EXCLUDE THE OPERATION OF KNOWN AND NATURAL AGENTS YET A BODY OF EVIDENCE IS HERE BROUGHT TO PROVE THAT SUCH EVENTS HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE
EXCEPT THAT IN THE SEVEN THERE WAS A LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS AND WHERE WAS THE VOLCANIC DUST ALL THAT TIME
THAT NOTHING BUT THIS FALLING SUBSTANCE WAS VISIBLE IN THE SKY IT FELL IN FLAKES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME TWO INCHES SQUARE
MY OWN CHIEF REASON FOR INDIGNATION HERE THAT THIS PREPOSTEROUS EXPLANATION INTERFERES WITH SOME OF MY OWN ENORMITIES IT WOULD COST ME TOO MUCH EXPLAINING IF I SHOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE
BUT BEFORE EVENING TWO OTHERS SPRANG UP OR WE'VE ARRIVED AT ONE OF THE OLDEST OF THE EXCLUSIONISTS CONVENTIONS OR NOSTOC WE SHALL HAVE MANY DATA
ALSO THERE WERE BLUE MOONS
MAY SIXTEENTH OR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS THE DATE GIVEN IN THE JOURNAL
THE PHENOMENON WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE REMARKS BEFORE US WILL SEEM TO MOST PERSONS AS LITTLE WORTHY OF CREDIT AS ANY THAT COULD BE OFFERED THE FALLING OF LARGE STONES FROM THE SKY WITHOUT ANY ASSIGNABLE CAUSE OF THEIR PREVIOUS ASCENT
OR DATA OF THEM BOMBARDED THE WALLS RAISED AGAINST THEM MONTHLY REVIEW
GREEN SCIENCE GOSSIP
THAT SEEMED TO PASS NEAR THE GROUND
TO GIVE COMPLETENESS TO THE PROPER EXPLANATION IT IS SAID THAT MISTER BRANDEIS HAD IDENTIFIED THE SUBSTANCE AS FLESH COLORED NOSTOC PROFESSOR LAWRENCE SMITH OF KENTUCKY
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SO DEFINITELY IDENTIFIED AS OF A KNOWN LOCAL SPECIES OR THEY WERE NOT FISH AT ALL I INCLINE MYSELF TO THE ACCEPTANCE THAT THEY WERE NOT FISH
SAYS THAT ALL OUR DATA IN THIS RESPECT MUST BE
WRITES OF THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD SO COMPLETELY OR BEAUTIFULLY IF BEAUTY IS COMPLETENESS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC IT TURNED OUT TO BE LUNG TISSUE ALSO
HE IS VERY SURE BUT JUST A LITTLE REDUNDANT WE SHALL BE OPPOSED BY THE STANDARD RESISTANCES THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
THE FLAKE FORMATION IS INTERESTING LATER WE SHALL THINK OF IT AS SIGNIFYING PRESSURE SOMEWHERE IT WAS A THICK SHOWER ON THE GROUND ON TREES ON FENCES BUT IT WAS NARROWLY LOCALIZED
DISTRIBUTION OF THE DUST OF KRAKATOA VELOCITY OF TRANSLATION
RECOGNIZED IT IN A MOMENT IT WAS A GELATINOUS FUNGUS HE DID NOT SATISFY HIMSELF AS TO JUST THE EXACT SPECIES IT BELONGED TO BUT HE PREDICTED THAT SIMILAR FUNGI MIGHT SPRING UP WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
OF BATH HIS DESCRIPTION IS OF MINUTE WORMS IN FILMY ENVELOPES HE TRIES TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR SEGREGATION THE MYSTERY OF IT IS WHAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT SO MANY OF THEM TOGETHER
WITH WHICH WE SHALL END UP IT WILL MEAN THAT SOMETHING HAD BEEN IN A STATIONARY POSITION FOR SEVERAL DAYS OVER A SMALL PART OF A SMALL TOWN IN ENGLAND THIS IS THE REVOLUTIONARY THING THAT WE HAVE ALLUDED TO BEFORE
SMALL FROGS FELL AT WIGAN ENGLAND NATURE EIGHTY SEVEN TEN THAT JUNE TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN ELEVEN AT ETON BUCKS ENGLAND THE GROUND WAS FOUND COVERED WITH MASSES OF JELLY THE SIZE OF PEAS
IN A WHIRLWIND NOW I CAN'T SAY THAT NOSTOC IS ALWAYS GREENISH ANY MORE THAN I CAN SAY THAT BLACKBIRDS ARE ALWAYS BLACK HAVING SEEN A WHITE ONE WE SHALL QUOTE A SCIENTIST WHO KNEW OF FLESH COLORED NOSTOC WHEN
IF THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD SEEM TO COMBINE AGAINST YOU IT IS ONLY UNREAL COMBINATION OR INTERMEDIATENESS TO UNITY AND DISUNITY EVERY RESISTANCE IS ITSELF DIVIDED INTO PARTS RESISTING ONE ANOTHER THE SIMPLEST STRATEGY SEEMS TO BE
THAT FAR INTO OUR OWN TIMES SOME SCIENTISTS NOTABLY PROFESSOR LAWRENCE SMITH AND SIR ROBERT BALL CONTINUED TO HOLD OUT AGAINST ALL EXTERNAL ORIGINS ASSERTING THAT NOTHING COULD FALL TO THIS EARTH
SO HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT SOMETHING IS NOT SOMETHING ELSE WHEN NEITHER IS SOMETHING ELSE SOME OTHER THING THERE'S NOTHING TO PROVE THIS IS ONE OF THE PROFUNDITIES THAT WE ADVERTISED IN ADVANCE
STEP THIS WAY SIR IF YOU PLEASE IT'S ONLY ONCE A YEAR SIR PLEADED BOB APPEARING FROM THE TANK IT SHALL NOT BE REPEATED I WAS MAKING RATHER MERRY YESTERDAY SIR

HE THOUGHT IT QUITE AS WELL THAT THEY SHOULD WRINKLE UP THEIR EYES IN GRINS AS HAVE THE MALADY IN LESS ATTRACTIVE FORMS HIS OWN HEART LAUGHED AND THAT WAS QUITE ENOUGH FOR HIM
GLORIOUS RUNNING TO THE WINDOW HE OPENED IT AND PUT OUT HIS HEAD NO FOG NO MIST CLEAR BRIGHT JOVIAL
OPENED HIS LITTLE STABLE AND CRIED HANSEL WE ARE SAVED THE OLD WITCH IS DEAD THEN HANSEL SPRANG LIKE A BIRD FROM ITS CAGE WHEN THE DOOR IS OPENED HOW THEY DID REJOICE AND EMBRACE EACH OTHER

I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAY OF THE MONTH IT IS SAID SCROOGE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN AMONG THE SPIRITS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING I'M QUITE A BABY NEVER MIND I DON'T CARE
THE DUCK CAME TO THEM AND HANSEL SEATED HIMSELF ON ITS BACK AND TOLD HIS SISTER TO SIT BY HIM NO REPLIED GRETEL THAT WILL BE TOO HEAVY FOR THE LITTLE DUCK

AS HE HAD SEEN THEM WITH THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND WALKING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM SCROOGE REGARDED EVERY ONE WITH A DELIGHTED SMILE HE LOOKED SO IRRESISTIBLY PLEASANT IN A WORD

IS YOUR MASTER AT HOME MY DEAR SAID SCROOGE TO THE GIRL NICE GIRL VERY YES SIR WHERE IS HE MY LOVE SAID SCROOGE HE'S IN THE DINING ROOM SIR
THERE'S THE WINDOW WHERE I SAW THE WANDERING SPIRITS IT'S ALL RIGHT
WERE ONLY TO BE EXCEEDED BY THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN AND CHUCKLED TILL HE CRIED SHAVING WAS NOT AN EASY TASK
OF COURSE THEY CAN OF COURSE THEY CAN HALLO MY FINE FELLOW
HE WAS AT HOME IN FIVE MINUTES NOTHING COULD BE HEARTIER HIS NIECE LOOKED JUST THE SAME SO DID TOPPER WHEN HE CAME SO DID THE PLUMP SISTER WHEN SHE CAME SO DID EVERY ONE WHEN THEY CAME
AND HAD HEARD WHAT THEIR STEPMOTHER HAD SAID TO THEIR FATHER GRETEL WEPT BITTER TEARS AND SAID TO HANSEL NOW ALL IS OVER WITH US BE QUIET GRETEL SAID HANSEL
AND HE DID IT YES HE DID THE CLOCK STRUCK NINE NO BOB A QUARTER PAST NO BOB
IF THE WILD BEASTS IN THE FOREST HAD BUT DEVOURED US WE SHOULD AT ANY RATE HAVE DIED TOGETHER JUST KEEP YOUR NOISE TO YOURSELF SAID THE OLD WOMAN IT WON'T HELP YOU AT ALL
YOU NAUGHTY CHILDREN WHY HAVE YOU SLEPT SO LONG IN THE FOREST WE THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING BACK AT ALL THE FATHER HOWEVER REJOICED FOR IT HAD CUT HIM TO THE HEART TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND ALONE
BUT SCOLDED AND REPROACHED HIM HE WHO SAYS A MUST SAY B LIKEWISE AND AS HE HAD YIELDED THE FIRST TIME HE HAD TO DO SO A SECOND TIME ALSO
GET UP LAZY THING FETCH SOME WATER AND COOK SOMETHING GOOD FOR YOUR BROTHER HE IS IN THE STABLE OUTSIDE AND IS TO BE MADE FAT WHEN HE IS FAT I WILL EAT HIM
AND DANCE ABOUT AND KISS EACH OTHER AND AS THEY HAD NO LONGER ANY NEED TO FEAR HER THEY WENT INTO THE WITCH'S HOUSE AND IN EVERY CORNER THERE STOOD CHESTS FULL OF PEARLS AND JEWELS
BUT NOW WE MUST BE OFF SAID HANSEL THAT WE MAY GET OUT OF THE WITCH'S FOREST WHEN THEY HAD WALKED FOR TWO HOURS THEY CAME TO A GREAT STRETCH OF WATER WE CANNOT CROSS SAID HANSEL
WHEN AT LAST THEY AWOKE IT WAS ALREADY DARK NIGHT GRETEL BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID HOW ARE WE TO GET OUT OF THE FOREST NOW BUT HANSEL COMFORTED HER AND SAID JUST WAIT A LITTLE
SHE SHALL TAKE US ACROSS ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE GOOD LITTLE DUCK DID SO AND WHEN THEY WERE ONCE SAFELY ACROSS AND HAD WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME THE FOREST SEEMED TO BE MORE AND MORE FAMILIAR TO THEM AND AT LENGTH
THE CHILDREN HOWEVER WERE STILL AWAKE AND HAD HEARD THE CONVERSATION WHEN THE OLD FOLKS WERE ASLEEP HANSEL AGAIN GOT UP AND WANTED TO GO OUT AND PICK UP PEBBLES AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE
NOW CHILDREN LAY YOURSELVES DOWN BY THE FIRE AND REST WE WILL GO INTO THE FOREST AND CUT SOME WOOD WHEN WE HAVE DONE WE WILL COME BACK AND FETCH YOU AWAY HANSEL AND GRETEL

I THANK YOU FIFTY TIMES BLESS YOU HE WENT TO CHURCH AND WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE HURRYING TO AND FRO AND PATTED CHILDREN ON THE HEAD AND QUESTIONED BEGGARS

IN HIS BED AND TOSSED ABOUT IN HIS ANXIETY HE GROANED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE

SAT BY THE FIRE AND WHEN NOON CAME EACH ATE A LITTLE PIECE OF BREAD AND AS THEY HEARD THE STROKES OF THE WOOD AXE THEY BELIEVED THAT THEIR FATHER WAS NEAR IT WAS NOT THE AXE HOWEVER
I AM AS MERRY AS A SCHOOLBOY I AM AS GIDDY AS A DRUNKEN MAN A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO EVERYBODY A HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL THE WORLD HALLO HERE WHOOP
YOU MUST HAVE A CAB THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE SAID THIS AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE PAID FOR THE TURKEY AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE PAID FOR THE CAB AND THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE RECOMPENSED THE BOY
REALLY FOR A MAN WHO HAD BEEN OUT OF PRACTICE FOR SO MANY YEARS IT WAS A SPLENDID LAUGH A MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LAUGH THE FATHER OF A LONG LONG LINE OF BRILLIANT LAUGHS
THE WOMAN LED THE CHILDREN STILL DEEPER INTO THE FOREST WHERE THEY HAD NEVER IN THEIR LIVES BEEN BEFORE THEN A GREAT FIRE WAS AGAIN MADE AND THE MOTHER SAID
GRETEL BEGAN TO WEEP BITTERLY BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN FOR SHE WAS FORCED TO DO WHAT THE WICKED WITCH COMMANDED AND NOW THE BEST FOOD WAS COOKED FOR POOR HANSEL BUT GRETEL
YERSTED THAT WILL BE THE SIMPLER WAY TO RETURN I SAID SMILING AS I HANDED THE FORGED ORDER TO THE BOY COME WE SHALL SEE NOW HOW WELL IT WORKS BUT OUR SWORDS HE EXCLAIMED WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO EXPLAIN THEM
IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE OUR PREPARATIONS IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE UTMOST SECRECY MUST BE MAINTAINED TO KEEP THE PROJECT FROM THE EARS OF ZAT ARRAS KANTOS KAN WAS CONFIDENT NOW THAT THE MAN'S AMBITIONS WERE FULLY AROUSED
BUT OF A SUDDEN THE OLD FIRE OF UNCONQUERABLE SELF CONFIDENCE SURGED THROUGH ME I SPRANG TO MY FEET AND WITH BACK THROWN SHOULDERS AND UPRAISED SWORD TOOK A SOLEMN VOW TO REACH RESCUE AND REVENGE MY PRINCESS A HUNDRED SWORDS LEAPED FROM A HUNDRED SCABBARDS
AS LAY WITHIN THE POWER OF MY SWORD ARM IT WAS A GLORIOUS BATTLE BUT THE END SEEMED INEVITABLE
HE LAUGHED A LOW LAUGH OF PLEASURE AND RELIEF AND THEN REACHING OUT THROUGH THE INKY BLACKNESS HE SOUGHT MY SHOULDER AND PULLED MY EAR CLOSE TO HIS MOUTH NOTHING COULD BE BETTER HE WHISPERED THERE ARE SECRETS WITHIN THE SECRETS OF ISSUS OF WHICH
I HAD BACKED INTO THE PIT WHICH HAD RECEIVED ISSUS FOR A SECOND I TOPPLED THERE UPON THE BRINK THEN I TOO WITH THE BOY STILL TIGHTLY CLUTCHED IN MY ARMS PITCHED BACKWARD INTO THE BLACK ABYSS WE STRUCK A POLISHED CHUTE
WE WERE NOW IN A QUANDARY AS TO HOW TO PASS THE GUARDS WHO PATROLLED THE ISLAND ABOUT THE POOL AT LAST I HIT UPON A PLAN
WOULD HAVE TUMBLED ABOUT OUR HEADS BUT EVIDENTLY HE DECIDED THE MESSAGE MUST BE GENUINE NOR INDEED WAS THERE ANY GOOD REASON TO DOUBT IT SINCE IT WOULD SCARCE HAVE SEEMED CREDIBLE TO HIM THAT TWO SLAVES WOULD VOLUNTARILY HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES INTO CUSTODY IN ANY SUCH MANNER AS THIS
EVEN THEN THERE WAS NO SCURRYING OF FEET AS WE HAD EXPECTED AND WHILE THE BOY REMAINED TO DIRECT THE BOAT I SLID FROM CABIN TO CABIN IN FUTILE SEARCH FOR SOME MEMBER OF THE CREW
ONLY OUR FIRST ANCESTOR KNOWS HE REPLIED WE REACHED THE SUBMARINE POOL IN OMEAN WITHOUT INCIDENT HERE WE DEBATED THE WISDOM OF SINKING THE CRAFT BEFORE LEAVING HER BUT FINALLY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD ADD NOTHING TO OUR CHANCES FOR ESCAPE
WILL YOU TAKE OATH TO PROSECUTE THE SEARCH FOR HER AND BRING HER BACK IN SAFETY TO HER GRANDFATHER'S COURT UPON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD EACH OF THEM SWORE TO DO AS I HAD ASKED IT WAS AGREED THAT THE BATTLESHIPS THAT WERE TO BE REMODELLED SHOULD BE ORDERED TO HASTOR
IMMEDIATELY TWO GUARDSMEN APPEARED DRAGGING THE UNWILLING BRIDE TOWARD THE ALTAR HER HANDS WERE STILL MANACLED BEHIND HER EVIDENTLY TO PREVENT SUICIDE HER DISHEVELED HAIR AND PANTING BOSOM BETOKENED THAT
AND WE MAY RETURN TO THE BATTLE WHILE SHE WHO IS NOW THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM LOOKS DOWN FROM THE QUEEN'S TOWER UPON THE ANNIHILATION OF HER FORMER COUNTRYMEN AND WITNESSES THE GREATNESS
BENEATH WHICH THE POOR BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WAS DRAGGED TOWARD HER DOOM A GRIM SMILE FORCED ITSELF TO MY LIPS AS I THOUGHT OF THE RUDE AWAKENING THAT LAY IN STORE FOR THE RULER OF OKAR AND MY ITCHING FINGERS FONDLED THE HILT OF MY BLOODY SWORD
EVIDENTLY THIS SEEMED TO HIM THE EASIEST WAY OF RIDDING THE VESSEL OF MY PRESENCE AND KILLING ME AT THE SAME TIME BUT A KIND FATE INTERVENED AND BY A MIRACLE I ESCAPED WITH BUT SLIGHT BRUISES THE SHIP WAS MOVING SLOWLY AT THE TIME
WITH YOU AND CARTHORIS OUT OF THE WAY THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO PREVENT HIM FROM ASSUMING THE TITLE OF JEDDAK AND YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT SO LONG AS HE IS SUPREME HERE THERE IS NO SAFETY FOR EITHER OF YOU THERE IS A WAY CRIED HOR VASTUS TO THWART HIM EFFECTUALLY AND FOR EVER
WHO HAD FALLEN THICK BEFORE THE THRONE UPON ME AND UPON THE BATTLING WARRIORS AT THE OTHER DOOR THEY DID NOT ESSAY TO ENTER THE APARTMENT BUT SCANNED ITS EVERY CORNER FROM WHERE THEY STOOD AND THEN WHEN THEIR EYES HAD SOUGHT ITS ENTIRE AREA
OF THIS DYING WORLD AND SET THEM ONCE MORE TO THE LABOURS THE INTRIGUES THE MYSTERIES AND THE CRUELTIES
IT WAS THE VERY BOLDNESS OF THE PLAN WHICH RENDERED IT SUCCESSFUL WERE YOU CONNECTED WITH THE RISING OF THE SLAVES ASKED TORITH WE HAVE JUST HAD MEAGRE REPORTS OF SOME SUCH EVENT ALL WERE INVOLVED I REPLIED BUT IT AMOUNTED TO LITTLE
ANOTHER HELIUMETIC CITY FAR TO THE SOUTH WEST KANTOS KAN THOUGHT THAT THE DOCKS THERE IN ADDITION TO THEIR REGULAR WORK WOULD ACCOMMODATE AT LEAST SIX BATTLESHIPS AT A TIME AS HE WAS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE NAVY
CHAINED THOUGH SHE WAS STILL HAD SHE FOUGHT AGAINST THE THING THAT THEY WOULD DO TO HER AT SIGHT OF HER SALENSUS OLL ROSE AND DREW HIS SWORD
INTO THE MIGHTY MAGNET OF DESTRUCTION IT CONTROLLED THE RESULT OF THE SUDDEN COMING OF THE GUARDSMEN HAD BEEN TO COMPEL ME TO SEEK SECLUSION IN THE FIRST PASSAGEWAY THAT I COULD FIND AND THAT TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT PROVED TO BE NOT THE ONE WITH WHICH I WAS FAMILIAR
I EXPERIENCED THE SAME THRILLS AS THOUGH I WERE HANGING ABOVE A BOTTOMLESS PIT THEN I RELEASED MY HOLD AND DROPPED FOUR FEET TO A SOFT CUSHION OF SAND
THAT ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO INSPIRE ME TO VICTORY OVER EVEN GREATER ODDS AND I VERILY BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BESTED THE ENTIRE ROOMFUL OF YELLOW WARRIORS THAT DAY IN THE NUPTIAL CHAMBER OF THE PALACE AT KADABRA HAD NOT INTERRUPTION COME TO MY AID
AND AS ONE THEY ENLISTED WITH ME TO FOLLOW OUR BELOVED PRINCESS IN HER WANDERINGS EVEN TO THE SACRED ISS AND THE VALLEY DOR WE CAME UPON HER BUT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE PALACE WITH HER WAS FAITHFUL WOOLA THE HOUND BUT NONE OTHER
AT SIGHT OF US THE MEMBERS OF THE GUARD SPRANG FORWARD IN SURPRISE AND WITH LEVELLED RIFLES HALTED US I HELD OUT THE MESSAGE TO ONE OF THEM HE TOOK IT AND SEEING TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED TURNED AND HANDED IT TO TORITH
FATHER OF THERNS AND PHAIDOR HIS DAUGHTER PEERING INTO THE ROOM A QUICK GLANCE ABOUT THEY TOOK THEIR EYES RESTED FOR A MOMENT WIDE IN HORROR UPON THE DEAD BODY OF SALENSUS OLL UPON THE BLOOD THAT CRIMSONED THE FLOOR UPON THE CORPSES OF THE NOBLES
FROM SCRAPS OF CONVERSATION WHICH WE OVERHEARD IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BLACK PIRATES WERE SEARCHING FOR A PARTY OF FUGITIVES THAT HAD ESCAPED THEM SEVERAL DAYS PRIOR
WHAT I WAS MOST CONCERNED IN OF COURSE WAS THE RESCUING OF DEJAH THORIS
HE ALONE MAY REVIVE THE FLAGGING COURAGE OF OUR WARRIORS HE ALONE MAY SAVE THE DAY FOR OKAR WHERE IS SALENSUS OLL THE NOBLES STEPPED BACK FROM ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF THEIR RULER AND ONE OF THEM POINTED TO THE GRINNING CORPSE
I HOPE HE HEARD ONLY OUR REFERENCES TO A NEW JEDDAK I SAID IF HE OVERHEARD OUR PLANS TO RESCUE DEJAH THORIS IT WILL MEAN CIVIL WAR FOR HE WILL ATTEMPT TO THWART US AND IN THAT I WILL NOT BE THWARTED THERE WOULD I TURN AGAINST TARDOS MORS HIMSELF
ON A LEVEL FLOOR OF SOFT SAND VERY QUIETLY I LOWERED MYSELF FROM THE INKY CELL ABOVE INTO THE INKY PIT BELOW SO UTTERLY DARK WAS IT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE OUR HANDS AT AN INCH FROM OUR NOSES NEVER I THINK
THE ALLOTTED HOUR HAS COME HE WAS SAYING AS I ENTERED THE APARTMENT AND THOUGH THE ENEMIES OF OKAR BE WITHIN HER GATES NAUGHT MAY STAY THE WILL OF SALENSUS OLL THE GREAT CEREMONY MUST BE OMITTED
THERE WERE PLENTY OF BLACKS ON OMEAN TO THWART US WERE WE APPREHENDED HOWEVER MANY MORE MIGHT COME FROM THE TEMPLES AND GARDENS OF ISSUS WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY DECREASE OUR CHANCES
AND MY HEART SANK WITHIN ME AS I CURSED MYSELF FOR A STUPID FOOL IN NOT HAVING SUNK THE SUBMARINE TO MAKE GOOD THE LIE THAT I MUST TELL HIS ORDERS WERE TO RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO THE TEMPLE LANDING I REPLIED
CHAPTER TWELVE DOOMED TO DIE FOR AN INSTANT I STOOD THERE BEFORE THEY FELL UPON ME BUT THE FIRST RUSH OF THEM FORCED ME BACK A STEP OR TWO MY FOOT FELT FOR THE FLOOR BUT FOUND ONLY EMPTY SPACE
BLACKNESS PLEASANT OLD LADY SAID A VOICE AT MY SIDE WHO SPEAKS I ASKED TIS I YOUR COMPANION WHO HAS HAD THE HONOUR THIS DAY OF FIGHTING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE GREATEST WARRIOR THAT EVER WORE METAL UPON BARSOOM
IN THE POWER OF THE FIRST BORN IT IS THE ONLY WAY I ANSWERED
FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME AT LEAST THEY WILL BE COMPARATIVELY SAFE HE SAID AND WE WILL AT LEAST KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THEM
SINCE WE CANNOT EXPLAIN THEM WE SHALL HAVE TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND US I REPLIED IS IT NOT THE
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT IN SOME FAR OFF CORNER OF THE PLANET THERE STILL EXISTED A REMNANT OF THE ANCIENT RACE OF YELLOW MEN MY REVERIES WERE BROKEN IN UPON BY A LOW EXCLAMATION FROM THE BOY AT LAST THE LIGHTED WAY HE CRIED
IT WOULD BE WEARISOME TO NARRATE THE DETAILS OF THAT BLOODY STRUGGLE OF HOW WE FOUGHT FROM THE DOORWAY THE FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM TO THE VERY FOOT OF THE THRONE BEFORE THE LAST OF MY ANTAGONISTS FELL WITH MY BLADE PIERCING HIS HEART AND THEN WITH A GLAD CRY
WHOM IT WAS OUR PLAN TO SEND IN TRANSPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE VALLEY DOR AND THE TEMPLE OF ISSUS WHILE THE FLEET ENTERED OMEAN AND DESTROYED THE VESSELS OF THE FIRST BORN UPON HOR VASTUS DEVOLVED THE DELICATE MISSION OF ORGANISING A SECRET FORCE OF FIGHTING MEN SWORN TO FOLLOW JOHN CARTER
WITH THE FLAT OF MY SWORD I STRUCK DOWN HIS POLLUTING HAND AND GRASPING DEJAH THORIS ROUND THE WAIST I SWUNG HER BEHIND ME AS WITH MY BACK AGAINST THE DRAPERIES OF THE DAIS I FACED THE TYRANT OF THE NORTH AND HIS ROOMFUL OF NOBLE WARRIORS
OF THE DEAD SEA BOTTOMS THAT HAD DRIVEN THEM STEP BY STEP TO THE UTTERMOST PINNACLE OF THE WORLD WHERE THEY WERE NOW INTRENCHED BEHIND AN IMPENETRABLE BARRIER OF SUPERSTITION IN ADDITION TO THE GREEN MEN THERE HAD BEEN THREE PRINCIPAL RACES UPON BARSOOM
NEVER SHALL I FORGET THAT TRIP THROUGH THE PITS OF ISSUS WHILE IT WAS DEVOID OF IMPORTANT INCIDENTS YET IT WAS FILLED FOR ME WITH A STRANGE CHARM OF EXCITEMENT AND ADVENTURE
SO I CANNOT DESERT HIM NO SAID THE BOY ONE CANNOT DESERT A FRIEND IT WERE BETTER TO BE RECAPTURED OURSELVES THAN THAT THEN HE COMMENCED GROPING HIS WAY ABOUT THE FLOOR OF THE DARK CHAMBER
A WAY INTO THE ALMOST IMPREGNABLE PALACE OF THE TYRANT OF THE NORTH AS I CROSSED THE CHAMBER TO ATTACK THE KADABRANS FROM THE REAR A SMALL DOORWAY AT MY LEFT OPENED AND TO MY SURPRISE REVEALED THE FIGURES OF MATAI SHANG
SO THAT TO ME WAS LEFT THE REMNANTS OF THE YELLOW MEN WITHIN THE THRONEROOM THEY KEPT ME BUSY TOO
THE FORMER AGREED TO TAKE SUCH VESSELS AS WE REQUIRED INTO DOCK AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
WITH A SINGLE LOW FOR THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM I RAN MY BLADE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE ROTTEN HEART OF OKAR'S ROTTEN RULER AND BEFORE THE WHITE DRAWN FACES OF HIS NOBLES SALENSUS OLL ROLLED GRINNING IN HORRIBLE DEATH TO THE FOOT OF THE STEPS BELOW HIS MARRIAGE THRONE
THAT THEY CONSIDERED THE CAPTURE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN IMPORTANT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE LONG AND EARNEST INTERVIEW THE COMMANDER OF THE FLEET HELD WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM LATER SHE WAS BOUND AND PLACED IN THE COMPARTMENT WITH DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF THE NEW CAPTIVE WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL
THE GUARDS BELOW THERE THE GUARDS WE WERE CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND ALL SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN RUN QUICKLY ACROSS A LITTLE PIECE OF SWARD AND DISAPPEAR IN THE SHRUBBERY BEYOND HE WAS ON THE BALCONY WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM CRIED HOR VASTUS QUICK LET US FOLLOW HIM
WHO WAS EMERGING FROM HIS OFFICE TO LEARN THE CAUSE OF THE COMMOTION THE BLACK READ THE ORDER AND FOR A MOMENT EYED US WITH EVIDENT SUSPICION
SILENTLY THEY LIFTED ME AND BORE ME TOWARD THE DOOR OF MY CHAMBER AS THEY PASSED THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH THE FARTHER MOON WAS CASTING ITS BRILLIANT BEAMS I SAW THAT EACH OF THE PARTY HAD HIS FACE SWATHED IN LAYERS OF SILK I COULD NOT RECOGNIZE ONE OF THEM
FESTERING IN ITS ROTTENNESS BY YOUR SIDE UNTIL CRAZED BY LONELINESS AND HUNGER YOU FEED UPON THE CRAWLING MAGGOTS THAT WERE ONCE A MAN THAT WAS ALL IN ANOTHER INSTANT SHE WAS GONE AND THE DIM LIGHT WHICH HAD FILLED THE CELL
BUT SOLAN'S LAST LOUD CRY HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT EFFECT FOR A MOMENT LATER A DOZEN GUARDSMEN BURST INTO THE CHAMBER THOUGH NOT BEFORE I HAD SO BENT AND DEMOLISHED THE GREAT SWITCH THAT IT COULD NOT BE AGAIN USED TO TURN THE POWERFUL CURRENT
WE SEEM TO BE IN A PRETTY FIX HERE WITH A SPLENDID CHANCE OF DYING OF STARVATION AND THIRST WHERE ARE WE BENEATH THE ARENA I REPLIED WE TUMBLED DOWN THE SHAFT THAT SWALLOWED ISSUS AS SHE WAS ALMOST AT OUR MERCY
WHEN WE OVERTOOK HER SHE FEIGNED ANGER AND ORDERED US BACK TO THE PALACE BUT FOR ONCE WE DISOBEYED HER AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT WE WOULD NOT LET HER GO UPON THE LAST LONG PILGRIMAGE ALONE SHE WEPT AND EMBRACED US AND TOGETHER WE WENT OUT INTO THE NIGHT TOWARD THE SOUTH
WHILE THE PRINCESS JUMPED UP AND WITH A GESTURE OF DESPERATION
AH MY FRIEND SHE SAID TOUCHING HIS ARM AS SHE HAD DONE HER SON'S WHEN SPEAKING TO HIM THAT AFTERNOON BELIEVE ME I SUFFER NO LESS THAN YOU DO BUT BE A MAN
ON THE MOUNTAIN CALLED HIYEI ZAN NEAR KYOTO ONE SUMMER DAY THIS GOOD PRIEST AFTER A VISIT TO THE CITY WAS RETURNING TO HIS TEMPLE BY WAY OF KITA NO OJI
AND MISTER GREGORY HAD AN EYE COMPARED WITH WHICH THAT OF AN EAGLE WAS MORE OR LESS BLEARED PSMITH SAUNTERED TO THE DOOR AND PUSHED IT OPEN IN A GINGERLY MANNER
AND ONLY THEN BEGAN TO THINK OF THE INTERVIEW WITH HIS DYING FATHER WHICH AWAITED HIM HE NOTICED THAT THEY HAD NOT COME TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE BUT TO THE BACK DOOR
HALFWAY UP THE STAIRS THEY WERE ALMOST KNOCKED OVER BY SOME MEN WHO CARRYING PAILS CAME RUNNING DOWNSTAIRS THEIR BOOTS CLATTERING THESE MEN PRESSED CLOSE TO THE WALL
NEVER A DAY PASSES IN WHICH THIS REGRET DOES NOT COME TO ME IN THE HOUR OF MORNING OR OF EVENING PRAYER AH MY FRIEND IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO CONQUER TIME AND SPACE LIKE THE BODHISATTVAS
AND ALL THE DEMONS HE SAW BOW DOWN BEFORE THE LION THRONE AND HE HEARD THAT MULTITUDE INCALCULABLE OF BEINGS PRAISING THE SUTRA OF THE LOTOS OF THE GOOD LAW LIKE THE ROAR OF A SEA BEFORE THE LORD
WITH ALL HER MIGHT THIS ACTION WAS SO UNLIKE HER USUAL COMPOSURE AND THE FEAR DEPICTED ON PRINCE VASILI'S FACE SO OUT OF KEEPING WITH HIS DIGNITY
EXCELLENT WE MUST BE GETTING ON WE MUST NOT MISS A MOMENT OF THE MATCH
NOT TWO MINUTES HAD PASSED BEFORE PRINCE VASILI WITH HEAD ERECT MAJESTICALLY ENTERED THE ROOM
A GRAND BAT THAT BOY I SAID SO LAST SUMMER BETTER THAN ANY OF HIS BROTHERS
THEN FORGETTING UTTERLY HIS PLEDGE FOOLISHLY DREAMING THAT HE STOOD IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VERY BUDDHA HE CAST HIMSELF DOWN IN WORSHIP WITH TEARS OF LOVE AND THANKSGIVING
VIA THE POSTAGE AND INWARDS BILLS DEPARTMENTS TOOK HIM TO THE SWING DOORS IT WAS HERE THAT THE DANGER BECAME ACUTE THE DOORS WERE WELL WITHIN VIEW OF THE FIXED DEPOSITS DEPARTMENT
THIRTY AT LUNCH TIME HE WOULD APPEAR TO BE MAKING SOMETHING OF A STAND WITH HIS BROTHER JOE WHO HAS MADE SIXTY ONE UP TO THE MOMENT OF GOING TO PRESS IT'S POSSIBLE HE MAY STILL BE IN WHEN WE GET THERE IN WHICH CASE WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO SLIDE INTO THE PAVILION
AND AT THE BIG STOUT FIGURE OF PIERRE WHO HANGING HIS HEAD MEEKLY FOLLOWED HER
OUR RESOLVE AND RETURN TO THE BANK IS UNWORTHY OF YOU BE A MAN BITE THE BULLET THE FIRST KEEN PANG WILL PASS TIME WILL SOFTEN THE FEELING OF BEREAVEMENT YOU MUST BE BRAVE
HE HAD NOT PROCEEDED VERY FAR WHEN HE SAW A STRANGE MONK COME OUT OF A BAMBOO GROVE BY THE ROAD SIDE AND HASTEN TOWARDS HIM THE MONK RESPECTFULLY SALUTED HIM AND SAID SIR
ALL WE RELATIVES HAVE BEEN IN SUCH ANXIETY THIS YOUNG MAN IS THE COUNT'S SON SHE ADDED MORE SOFTLY WHAT A TERRIBLE MOMENT
THIS STORY MAY BE FOUND IN THE CURIOUS OLD JAPANESE BOOK CALLED JIKKUN SHO THE SAME LEGEND HAS FURNISHED THE SUBJECT OF AN INTERESTING NO PLAY CALLED DAI E THE GREAT ASSEMBLY
PITYINGLY THROUGH HIS EYEGLASS MIKE WHO FELT EMBARRASSED TOOK A SEAT SOME LITTLE WAY BEHIND HIS COMPANION THIS WAS PSMITH'S AFFAIR AND HE PROPOSED TO ALLOW HIM TO DO THE TALKING
WHAT
HAD PLUNGED INTO HIS ROOM WITH A LONG STATEMENT OF HOW PSMITH DEPUTED TO HELP IN THE LIFE AND THOUGHT OF THE FIXED DEPOSITS DEPARTMENT HAD LEFT THE BUILDING AT FOUR O'CLOCK
A STRANGE LADY THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TO THE PRIESTS ROSE AND OFFERED HIM HER SEAT AN AIDE DE CAMP PICKED UP AND RETURNED A GLOVE PIERRE HAD DROPPED
SHE HURRIEDLY ASCENDED THE NARROW DIMLY LIT STONE STAIRCASE CALLING TO PIERRE WHO WAS LAGGING BEHIND TO FOLLOW THOUGH
BUT I INTEND TO ACQUIRE A KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW WHICH SHALL OUTWEIGH THIS DEFECT BEFORE LEAVING YOU I SHOULD LIKE TO SAY I MAY SPEAK FOR YOU AS WELL AS MYSELF COMRADE JACKSON
THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PSMITH ESTATES SEEMS THE JOB ON WHICH HE CAN GET THE RAPID HALF NELSON FOR MY OWN PART I FEEL THAT MY LONG SUIT IS THE BAR I AM A POOR UNREADY SPEAKER
MISTER SMITH HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THEN MADE UP HIS MIND VERY WELL HE SAID I REALLY THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA THERE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES OPEN TO A BARRISTER I WISH WE HAD THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE I AM
MISTER GREGORY WAS LEANING OVER THE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDED HIS LAIR FROM THE OUTER WORLD AND GESTICULATING VIOLENTLY WHERE ARE YOU GOING ROARED THE HEAD OF THE FIXED DEPOSITS
AND THE GODS OF THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE WIND AND THE SHINING MYRIADS OF BRAHMA'S HEAVEN AND INCOMPARABLY FURTHER THAN EVEN THE MEASURELESS CIRCLING OF THE GLORY OF THESE HE SAW
I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME MYSELF IN HIS PLACE PSMITH SMOOTHED HIS WAISTCOAT
HAVING TURNED WITH WORDS OF COMFORT TO HER COMPANION REALIZED THAT HE WAS ASLEEP IN HIS CORNER AND WOKE HIM UP ROUSING HIMSELF
SAID PSMITH PERHAPS YOU ARE WISE IN A WORD THEN HE PICKED UP THE BRANDY AND HELD IT OUT TO HIM
AS HE WALKED DELICATELY NOT COURTING OBSERVATION HE REMINDED HIMSELF OF THE HERO OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS ON ALL SIDES OF HIM LAY FEARSOME BEASTS LYING IN WAIT TO POUNCE UPON HIM
WITH SAMANTABHADRA AT HIS RIGHT HAND AND MANJUSRI AT HIS LEFT AND BEFORE THEM ASSEMBLED IMMEASURABLY SPREADING INTO SPACE LIKE A FLOOD OF STARS THE HOSTS OF THE MAHASATTVAS AND THE BODHISATTVAS
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING TIRED OF IT NOT PRECISELY TIRED BUT
ENGAGED WITH A CIGAR AND A CUP OF COFFEE IN THE LOWER SMOKING ROOM OF THE SENIOR CONSERVATIVE CLUB PSMITH AND MIKE ENTERED THE ROOM WHEN HE WAS ABOUT HALF THROUGH THESE LUXURIES PSMITH'S FIRST ACTION WAS TO SUMMON A WAITER
AND BEGIN IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME SAID THE MANAGER I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD SAY IT AND GO
ADDRESSING A MAID WHO WAS HURRYING PAST WITH A DECANTER ON A TRAY AS MY DEAR AND MY SWEET ASKED ABOUT THE PRINCESS HEALTH AND THEN LED PIERRE ALONG A STONE PASSAGE
THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL TO BE SAID FOR THE BAR AS A CAREER PSMITH KNEW HIS FATHER
KEEPING HIS EYES CLOSED AT LAST A VOICE SUDDENLY RESOUNDED ABOVE HIM A WONDERFUL VOICE DEEP AND CLEAR LIKE THE PEALING OF A MIGHTY BELL THE VOICE OF THE BUDDHA SAKYAMUNI
THEY HAD CAUGHT THE BIRD IN A SNARE AND WERE BEATING IT WITH STICKS OH THE POOR CREATURE COMPASSIONATELY EXCLAIMED THE PRIEST WHY DO YOU TORMENT IT SO CHILDREN
AND THAT IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE HIS HEAD AND DO FOOLISH THINGS HE MUST NOT ACT ON HIS OWN IDEAS TONIGHT BUT MUST YIELD HIMSELF UP ENTIRELY TO THE WILL OF THOSE WHO WERE GUIDING HIM
ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU IN SHORT PLEASE TO TELL ME FOR AS I HAPPEN TO POSSESS IN A SMALL DEGREE THE SIX SUPERNATURAL POWERS I AM ABLE TO GRATIFY ALMOST ANY WISH THAT YOU CAN EXPRESS
LITTLE BY LITTLE WE COME TO OURSELVES AGAIN LIFE WHICH WE HAD THOUGHT COULD HOLD NO MORE PLEASURE FOR US GRADUALLY SHOWS ITSELF NOT WHOLLY GREY
MISTER BICKERSDYKE SEEMED ABOUT TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION AT THIS POINT BUT PSMITH WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND HURRIED ON WE FIND THAT THE SUN STILL SHINES THE BIRDS STILL SING
THE DOCTOR CAST A RAPID GLANCE UPWARDS AND SILENTLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
MISTER BICKERSDYKE LOOKED FORWARD TO TOMORROW'S INTERVIEW WITH HIS EMPLOYEE MEANWHILE HAVING ENJOYED AN EXCELLENT DINNER HE WAS NOW AS PSMITH HAD PREDICTED
AND HE TURNED TO GO BUT PIERRE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO ASK HOW IS AND HESITATED NOT KNOWING WHETHER IT WOULD BE PROPER TO CALL THE DYING MAN
YOU MUST NOT SPEAK AT ALL
SO THAT NOW I CANNOT FLY AND WITH THESE WORDS THE TENGU VANISHED FOREVER
AND SAT DOWN IN THE LADY'S CHAIR PLACING HIS HUGE HANDS SYMMETRICALLY ON HIS KNEES IN THE NAIVE ATTITUDE OF AN EGYPTIAN STATUE AND DECIDED IN HIS OWN MIND THAT ALL WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
WITH ITS LARGE BUST AND FULL LENGTH PORTRAIT OF CATHERINE THE GREAT THE SAME PEOPLE
AND HEEDLESSLY ALLOWED YOUR FEELINGS TO OVERCOME YOU THE GOHOTENDO WHO IS THE GUARDIAN OF THE DOCTRINE SWOOPED DOWN SUDDENLY FROM HEAVEN UPON US
ALMOST CLOSING THE LATTER SIGHED AND MOVED AWAY FROM THE DOCTOR TO PIERRE TO HIM IN A PARTICULARLY RESPECTFUL AND TENDERLY SAD VOICE
THEY WERE MET BY A DEACON WITH A CENSER AND BY A SERVANT WHO PASSED OUT ON TIPTOE WITHOUT HEEDING THEM THEY WENT INTO THE RECEPTION ROOM FAMILIAR TO PIERRE
BUT HE DECIDED THAT ALL THESE THINGS HAD TO BE FROM THE PASSAGE THEY WENT INTO A LARGE DIMLY LIT ROOM ADJOINING THE COUNT'S RECEPTION ROOM
AND THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH MANDARAVA AND MANJUSHAKA FLOWERS SHOWERED FROM HEAVEN AND THE NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH FRAGRANCE AND SPLENDOUR AND THE SWEETNESS OF THE GREAT VOICE AND IN MID AIR
REASON SUGGESTED THAT THERE WERE PROBABLY ONE OR TWO KNOCKING ABOUT SOMEWHERE BUT THIS WAS NO TIME TO THINK OF THEM HE EXAMINED THE FUTURE AND FOUND IT GOOD
MISTER BICKERSDYKE EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT DEEPENING OF THE COLOUR OF HIS COMPLEXION GAVE NO SIGN OF HAVING SEEN THEM HE PUFFED AWAY AT HIS CIGAR HIS EYES FIXED ON THE CEILING AN
HOWEVER SAID PSMITH PHILOSOPHICALLY THESE ARE LIFE'S TRIALS AND MUST BE BORNE PATIENTLY A ROUNDABOUT ROUTE
MERCY AND POINTING OUT A SMALL SOFA FOR HIM TO SIT AND WAIT FOR HER SHE WENT SILENTLY TOWARD THE DOOR THAT EVERYONE WAS WATCHING
THE PROBLEM OF LIFE SEEMED TO HIM TO BE SOLVED HE LOOKED ON DOWN THE YEARS
THE MYSTERY WAS UNVEILED HAINES WAS THE THIRD BROTHER HIS REAL NAME WAS CHILDS THE BLACK PANTHER WAS HIMSELF THE GHOST OF HIS OWN FATHER HE DRANK DRUGS TO OBLITERATE FOR THIS RELIEF MUCH THANKS THE LONELY HOUSE BY THE GRAVEYARD IS UNINHABITED NO SOUL WILL LIVE THERE

WHILE TO RIGHT AND LEFT OF HIM WERE ACCOMMODATED THE FLIPPANT PROGNOSTICATOR
POSTHUMITY WITH RESPECT TO THE FATHER AND THAT RARER FORM WITH RESPECT TO THE MOTHER THE FRATRICIDAL CASE KNOWN AS THE CHILDS MURDER AND RENDERED MEMORABLE BY THE IMPASSIONED PLEA OF MISTER ADVOCATE BUSHE WHICH SECURED THE ACQUITTAL OF THE WRONGFULLY ACCUSED

HIS FACE GLOWING FROM THE BRINY AIRS OF THE MULL OF GALLOWAY THERE TOO OPPOSITE TO HIM WAS LYNCH WHOSE COUNTENANCE BORE ALREADY THE STIGMATA OF EARLY DEPRAVITY AND PREMATURE WISDOM
ALREADY ON THE ROAD A FULLFLEDGED TRAVELLER FOR THE FAMILY FIRM EQUIPPED WITH AN ORDERBOOK A SCENTED HANDKERCHIEF NOT FOR SHOW ONLY HIS CASE OF BRIGHT TRINKETWARE ALAS A THING NOW OF THE PAST
AND SNARES OF THE POXFIEND WHERE'S THE BUCK AND NAMBY AMBY SKUNKED LEG BAIL AWEEL YE MAUN E E N GANG YER GATES CHECKMATE KING TO TOWER
IN THE FIRST BLOOM OF HER NEW MOTHERHOOD BREATHING A SILENT PRAYER OF THANKSGIVING TO ONE ABOVE THE UNIVERSAL HUSBAND AND AS HER LOVING EYES BEHOLD HER BABE SHE WISHES ONLY ONE BLESSING MORE
LAST WORD IN ART SHADES MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOK COME OUT OF IRELAND MY TIME SILENTIUM GET A SPURT ON TENTION PROCEED TO NEAREST CANTEEN AND THERE ANNEX LIQUOR STORES MARCH TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP THE BOYS ARE ATITUDES PARCHING
NOW HE IS HIMSELF PATERNAL AND THESE ABOUT HIM MIGHT BE HIS SONS WHO CAN SAY THE WISE FATHER KNOWS HIS OWN CHILD HE THINKS OF A DRIZZLING NIGHT IN HATCH STREET HARD BY THE BONDED STORES THERE THE FIRST TOGETHER
THE MURMURING OF THE WATERS WHERE TILL WAS POURING ITS SLUGGISH FLOOD INTO THE MORE ACTIVE SWIRL AND RUSH OF THE TWEED THE HOT OPPRESSIVE AIR OF THE NIGHT AND THE BLOOD ON THE DRY ROAD
SO SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE WOULD WRITE MISSUS SMITH OR SEE HER TO SAY THAT YOU TOO ARE GOING TO BE MISSUS SMITH CHUCKLED THE ARCHDEACON'S COUSIN IN HIS DRY WAY WHICH MADE HIM SEEM EVEN OLDER THAN HE WAS
THEN YOU'LL BE PROVIDED WITH A CHAPERON I'M NOT ANXIOUS ABOUT MYSELF BUT ABOUT YOU ANNESLEY SAID YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME YET WHAT HAPPENED AFTER YOU WENT UPSTAIRS AT MISSUS ELLSWORTH'S AND HOW YOU KNEW THOSE MEN WERE GONE
AND I KNEW THEN THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN DEAD SOME TIME AND I KNEW ANOTHER THING IN THAT MOMENT POOR MAISIE LYING AWAKE TO LISTEN FOR THE TAP AT HER WINDOW SO THAT SHE MIGHT GET UP AND PEEP ROUND THE CORNER OF HER BLIND
REMEMBERING HOW HE HAD SAID THE COUNTESS WOULD MOTHER HER ANY ONE LESS MOTHERLY THAN THIS JUNO LIKE BEAUTY IN FLAME COLOURED CHIFFON OVER GOLD TISSUE IT WOULD BE HARD TO IMAGINE THE SPANISH SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTESS WAS OF A CAMELIA PALENESS
IT WAS THE BIGGEST THING THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED AND I STOOD STARING DOWN AT THE WHITE FACE AS IF I SHOULD NEVER LOOK AT ANYTHING ELSE AS LONG AS I LIVED I REMEMBER ALL ABOUT THAT SCENE
NOW YOU MUST ENGAGE HER ROOM NELSON SMITH SAID ABRUPTLY IT'S LATE YOU CAN MAKE FRIENDS AFTERWARD VERY WELL THE COUNTESS AGREED AND YOU WILL YOU COME TO THE DESK YET NO IT IS BETTER NOT
AND CALLING TO ME LET ME KNOW THAT THEY WERE MAISIE DUNLOP AND HER BROTHER TOM THAT SHE HAD MADE TO COME WITH HER
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU SLIP OUT OF MY DREAM NOW I'VE GOT YOU IN IT
NOTHING AND NOBODY I SAID WELL SAID HE WE'LL HAVE TO GET HIM AWAY FROM THIS YOU'LL HAVE TO GET HELP HE WENT ON TURNING TO THE CONSTABLE FETCH SOME MEN TO HELP US CARRY HIM
SHE WOULD HAVE FELT INSULTED YET SO IT WAS
WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN INTRODUCTION A HARDNESS ABOUT THE HANDSOME FACE A FEW LINES ABOUT THE EYES AND MOUTH AND A FULLNESS OF THE CHIN SHOWED THAT SHE WAS OLDER FORTY PERHAPS
THEN THEY WERE OFF THEY TWO ALONE TOGETHER AND ANNESLEY GUESSED THAT THE CHAUFFEUR MUST HAVE HAD HIS INSTRUCTIONS WHERE TO DRIVE AS SHE HEARD NONE GIVEN PERHAPS IT WAS BEST THAT THEIR DESTINATION SHOULD NOT BE PUBLISHED ALOUD FOR THERE ARE WALLS WHICH HAVE EARS
AND IF THEY WERE STILL LURKING ABOUT AND WATCHING ME FROM THE BRUSHWOOD AND I MADE AN EFFORT AND BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED ONE OF THE NERVELESS HANDS IT WAS STIFFENED ALREADY
BUT YOU'LL NOT MIND ME ASKING IT NOW WHAT WERE YOU DOING HERE YOURSELF AT THIS HOUR YOU'VE A GOOD RIGHT CHISHOLM SAID I AND I'LL TELL YOU FOR BY ALL I CAN SEE THERE'LL BE NO WAY OF KEEPING IT BACK
AFTERWARD YOU'LL BE NICE TO HER AND THAT WILL BE DOING HER A GOOD TURN BECAUSE SHE'S APT TO BE LONESOME IN LONDON
NOBODY PAID THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO THE NEWCOMERS AND ANNESLEY SETTLED DOWN UNOBTRUSIVELY IN A CORNER WHILE HER COMPANION WENT TO SCRIBBLE A LINE TO THE COUNTESS DE SANTIAGO WHEN HE HAD FINISHED AND SENT UP THE LETTER HE DID NOT RETURN
UNTIL THE MOMENT YOU'RE MY WIFE MEANTIME I'LL TRY TO GROW A BIT MORE LIKE WHAT YOUR LOVER OUGHT TO BE AND LATER I SHALL KISS YOU ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IF FIVE HOURS AGO ANY ONE HAD TOLD ANNESLEY GRAYLE
ANNESLEY STAMMERED HER EYES APPEALING SEEKING TO EXPLAIN AND BEGGING PARDON BUT IF QUITE RIGHT WHY NOT TELL HE ANSWERED INSTANTLY HIS FIRST GLANCE OF SURPRISE TURNING TO CHEERFUL REASSURANCE
I THINK THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN AND YOU WILL BE A LUCKY GIRL HE TOO WILL BE LUCKY I SEE THAT WITH ANOTHER SMILE ANNESLEY WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S VOICE WAS NOT SWEET
WHAT'S IN A NAME WE MIGHT AS WELL BE IN REALITY WHAT WE PLAYED AT BEING TO NIGHT
ALL THAT WAS WHAT AT MISTER GILVERTHWAITE'S BIDDING I HAD RIDDEN OUT FROM BERWICK TO FIND IN THAT LONELY SPOT BUT I KNEW OF COURSE THAT JAMES GILVERTHWAITE HIMSELF HAD NOT FORESEEN THIS AFFAIR
AND HAD ALMOND SHAPED DARK EYES WITH BROODING LASHES UNDER SLENDER BROWS THAT MET IN CONTRAST HER HAIR WAS OF A FLAME COLOUR VIVID AS HER DRAPERIES AND HER LIPS WERE RED AT FIRST GLANCE ANNESLEY THOUGHT THAT THE DAZZLING CREATURE COULD NOT BE MORE THAN THIRTY
WAS THIS THE MAN MISTER GILVERTHWAITE MEANT ME TO MEET WOULD MISTER GILVERTHWAITE HAVE BEEN MURDERED TOO IF HE HAD COME THERE IN PERSON AND HAD THE MAN BEEN MURDERED FOR THE SAKE OF ROBBERY
FOR IF HE KNOWS NO MORE HE'LL KNOW WHO YON MAN IS I MADE NO ANSWER TO THAT I HAD NO CERTAIN ANSWER TO MAKE I WAS ALREADY WONDERING ABOUT A LOT OF CONJECTURES
NOBODY AT THE SAVOY BUT THE COUNTESS DE SANTIAGO KNOWS WHO I AM AND SHE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT IT MAY BE CONVENIENT FOR ME TO CHANGE MY NAME NELSON SMITH IS A RESPECTABLE ONE AND SHE'LL RESPECT IT
IT FLASHED INTO THE GIRL'S MIND THAT IT WOULD BE PERFECT IF SHE COULD BE MARRIED TO HER KNIGHT BY ARCHDEACON SMITH BUT SHE HAD BEEN IMPRUDENT TOO OFTEN ALREADY SHE DARED NOT MAKE SUCH A SUGGESTION WITHOUT CONSULTING THE OTHER PERSON MOST CONCERNED
AND YET IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE HERSELF BUT SOMETHING WITHIN STRONGER THAN SHE THAT SUDDENLY TOOK CONTROL OF HER WHY SHOULD I NOT WISH TO TELL YOU THE SOMETHING WAS SAYING THE NAME IS THE SAME AS YOUR OWN SMITH
WHO HAD MET THERE IN THE COURSE OF THEIR NIGHT ROUNDS I KNEW THEM BOTH THE SERGEANT BEING ONE CHISHOLM AND THE CONSTABLE A MAN NAMED TURNDALE AND THEY KNEW ME WELL ENOUGH FROM HAVING SEEN ME IN THE COURT AT BERWICK
NOT CARING TO STAY LONGER FOR I HAD HEARD WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE SPOT BY A SINGLE BLOW FROM A KNIFE OR DAGGER WHICH HAD BEEN THRUST INTO HIS HEART FROM BEHIND WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE AND THE THOUGHT OF IT
TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT HER HUGHIE WAS ALIVE AND SAFE WOULD HAVE TO LIE QUAKING AND SPECULATING THROUGH THE DARK HOURS OF THAT NIGHT
I TELL YOU MEETING YOU AND WINNING YOU IN THIS WAY IS WORTH THE BEST TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE BUT YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION I'LL ANSWER IT NOW CRIED THE GIRL MEETING YOU IS WORTH ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE
HE SEEMED TO PUT THE THOUGHT OUT OF HIS MIND AND TURN TO THE NEXT ABOUT THE SAVOY HE WENT ON I WANT TO TAKE YOU THERE BECAUSE I KNOW A WOMAN STAYING IN THE HOTEL A WOMAN OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR MOTHER WHO'LL LOOK AFTER YOU TO PLEASE ME TILL WE'RE MARRIED
I WAS GOOD BEFORE WHEN I WAS TEMPTED TO KISS YOU YOU'RE AT MY MERCY NOW IN A WAY ALL THE MORE BECAUSE I'M TAKING YOU FROM YOUR OLD EXISTENCE TO ONE YOU DON'T KNOW I SHA'N'T ASK TO KISS YOU EXCEPT MAYBE YOUR LITTLE HAND IF YOU DON'T MIND
CHAPTER FOUR THE MURDERED MAN THERE MAY BE FOLK IN THE WORLD TO WHOM THE FINDING OF A DEAD MAN LYING GRIM AND STARK BY THE ROADSIDE WITH THE BLOOD FRESHLY RUN FROM IT
THAT THERE WAS MYSTERY IN THIS AFFAIR WAS SURER THAN EVER WHEN HAVING GOT THE MAN TO THE NEAREST INN AND BROUGHT MORE HELP INCLUDING A DOCTOR THEY BEGAN TO EXAMINE HIM AND HIS CLOTHING AND NOW
SHE SPOKE ENGLISH PERFECTLY WITH A SLIGHT FOREIGN ACCENT AND A ROLL OF THE LETTER R MY FRIEND NELSON SMITH SHE TURNED LAUGHING TO HIM HAS TOLD ME EX CITING NEWS WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER A LONG TIME
AND LINEN AND A TWEED SUIT OF THE SORT AFFECTED BY TOURISTS THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY IN HIS POCKETS BANK NOTES GOLD AND SILVER AND AN EXPENSIVE WATCH AND CHAIN AND OTHER SUCH THINGS THAT A GENTLEMAN WOULD CARRY
YOU SAW NOBODY ABOUT CLOSE BY NOR IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO STRANGERS ON THE ROAD I WAS READY FOR THAT QUESTION EVER SINCE FINDING THE BODY I HAD BEEN WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD SAY WHEN AUTHORITY
AND IT WAS WITH OPEN MOUTHED SURPRISE THAT THEY LISTENED TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL THEM PRESENTLY WE WERE ALL THREE ROUND THE DEAD MAN AND THIS TIME THERE WAS THE LIGHT OF THREE LAMPS ON HIS FACE AND ON THE GOUTS OF BLOOD THAT WERE ALL ABOUT HIM
BY JOVE HE EXCLAIMED I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT IT'S A DIFFICULTY BUT WE'LL OBVIATE IT SOMEHOW DON'T WORRY ONLY I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T ASK YOUR FRIEND THE ARCHDEACON TO MARRY US AS I MEANT TO SUGGEST
DRAWING ME ASIDE THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T ROB THE MAN OF HIS MONEY AND VALUABLES THEY TOOK SOMETHING ELSE FROM HIM THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OF MUCH MORE VALUE THAN EITHER WHAT I ASKED PAPERS SAID HE
MY ASSOCIATION WITH THOSE MEN IS ONE OF THE THINGS I LONG TO TURN THE KEY UPON I KNOW THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE BLUEBEARD TO FATIMA BUT IT ISN'T AS BAD AS THAT TO ME IT DOESN'T SEEM BAD AT ALL AND I SWEAR THAT WHATEVER MYSTERY
I SAW NOBODY AND HEARD NOTHING ABOUT HERE SAID I IT'S NOT LIKELY THERE'D BE STRANGERS IN THIS SPOT AT MIDNIGHT FOR THAT MATTER THE POOR FELLOW IS A STRANGER HIMSELF SAID HE
THIS IS NO BY CHANCE MURDER CHISHOLM AS YOU'LL BE FINDING OUT WELL WELL I NEVER KNEW ITS LIKE HE REMARKED STARING FROM ME TO THE BODY AND FROM IT TO ME
OR A FEW YEARS AGO AND IN THE WAVE OF RELIEF WHICH OVERWHELMED HER ANNESLEY FORGOT RUTHVEN SMITH'S QUESTION AND HER ANSWER SHE REMEMBERED AGAIN ONLY WITH THE SHOCK OF HEARING HIM ADDRESS THE NEWCOMER BY THE NAME SHE HAD GIVEN
AND THAT THE DEAD MAN MUST ACCORDINGLY HAVE COME TO COLDSTREAM NOT MANY HOURS BEFORE HIS DEATH AND WE'LL LIKELY FIND SOMETHING ABOUT HIM FROM EITHER DUNDEE OR PEEBLES BUT I'M INCLINED TO THINK MISTER HUGH HE CONTINUED
SHE NOTICED THAT THIS HAND WAS AS WONDERFUL AS THE REST OF THE WOMAN'S PERSONALITY IT WAS VERY LONG VERY NARROW
WOULD MISTER GILVERTHWAITE KNOW WHO THE MAN WAS WAS HE THE MAN I OUGHT TO HAVE MET OR HAD THAT MAN BEEN THERE WITNESSED THE MURDER AND GONE AWAY FRIGHTENED TO STOP WHERE THE MURDER HAD BEEN DONE OR
EVEN THE THUMB WAS ABNORMALLY LONG WHICH FACT PREVENTED THE HAND FROM BEING AS BEAUTIFUL AS IT WAS SOMEHOW UNFORGETTABLE THIS IS A PLEASURE AND A SURPRISE BEGAN THE COUNTESS SMILING
NOW MISSUS ELLSWORTH IS ELIMINATED I'M NO LONGER A SECRET AND I EXPECT YOU'LL LIKE TO MEET MISTER RUTHVEN SMITH AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE A HOUSE TO ENTERTAIN HIM IN SO SPEAKING
I SUPPOSE YOU DID KNOW OR DID YOU CHANCE IT I WAS AS SURE AS I NEEDED TO BE NELSON SMITH ANSWERED A MOMENT AFTER I SWITCHED ON THE ELECTRICITY IN THE ROOM UP THERE I HEARD A TAXI DRIVE AWAY
AND HE'S AT PRESENT IN HIS BED WITH A CHILL OR SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE TO KEEP HIM THERE AND TONIGHT HE GOT ME TO RIDE OUT HERE TO MEET A MAN WHOM HE OUGHT TO HAVE MET HIMSELF AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AND ALL THAT I HAVE TO DO WITH IT
I'M NOT MUCH OF A PRINCESS BUT YOU ARE SAINT GEORGE SAINT GEORGE HE ECHOED A RING OF BITTERNESS UNDER HIS LAUGH THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN CALLED A SAINT AND I'M AFRAID IT WILL BE THE LAST I CAN'T LIVE UP TO THAT
I TURNED OFF THE LIGHT SO I COULD LOOK OUT BY FLATTENING MY NOSE AGAINST THE GLASS I COULD SEE THAT THE PLACE WHERE THOSE CHAPS HAD WAITED WAS EMPTY BUT IN CASE THE TAXI WAS ONLY TURNING AND MEANT TO PASS THE HOUSE AGAIN I LIT THE ROOM ONCE MORE FOR REALISM
YET AGAIN WAS THIS SOME MAN WHO HAD COME UPON MISTER GILVERTHWAITE'S CORRESPONDENT AND FOR SOME REASON BEEN MURDERED BY HIM IT WAS HOWEVER ALL BEYOND ME JUST THEN AND PRESENTLY THE SERGEANT AND I WERE ON OUR MACHINES
TO THE VALLEY IN GOOD TIME PROVIDED YOU LEFT YOUR HOFFMAN SKY CAMP EARLY TWO DAY EXCURSIONS
THREE BROTHERS AND EL CAPITAN WITH THE DOME PAVED BASIN OF YOSEMITE CREEK AND MOUNT HOFFMAN IN THE BACKGROUND
THE GROVES ABOUT THE SODA SPRINGS ARE FAVORITE CAMPING GROUNDS ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLD PLEASANT TASTING WATER CHARGED WITH CARBONIC ACID AND BECAUSE OF THE VIEWS OF THE MOUNTAINS ACROSS THE MEADOW THE GLACIER MONUMENT CATHEDRAL PEAK
TO ANY ONE NOT DESPERATELY TIME POOR THIS TRIP SHOULD HAVE FOUR DAYS INSTEAD OF THREE CAMPING THE SECOND NIGHT AT THE SODA SPRINGS
WERE THE MOST INTERESTING OF THEM ALL THE PATH OF THE VANISHED GLACIER SHONE IN MANY PLACES AS IF WASHED WITH SILVER AND PUSHING UP THE CANYON ON THIS BRIGHT ROAD I PASSED LAKE AFTER LAKE IN SOLID BASINS OF GRANITE
WITH A SLOPE OF ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF IT I DISCOVERED A VERY SMALL BUT WELL CHARACTERIZED GLACIER SWOOPING DOWN FROM THE SHADOWY CLIFFS OF THE MOUNTAIN TO ITS TERMINAL MORAINE
WHILE THE GLACIER MEADOWS WILL BE IN THEIR GLORY AND THE SNOW ON THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE FIRM ENOUGH TO MAKE CLIMBING SAFE LONG AGO I MADE THESE SIERRA TRIPS CARRYING ONLY A SACKFUL OF BREAD WITH A LITTLE TEA AND SUGAR AND WAS THUS INDEPENDENT AND FREE
TRITICUM AND AGROSTIS IN OCTOBER THE NIGHTS ARE FROSTY AND THEN THE MEADOWS AT SUNRISE WHEN EVERY LEAF IS LADEN WITH CRYSTALS ARE A FINE SIGHT
SWEEPING IN BEAUTIFUL CURVES FROM THE HOLLOWS AND CANYONS
SEPARATED BY CANYONS AND DARKENED WITH LINES AND FIELDS OF FOREST CATHEDRAL PEAK AND MOUNT HOFFMAN IN THE DISTANCE SMALL LAKES AND INNUMERABLE MEADOWS IN THE FOREGROUND
THE TOP OF LIBERTY CAP VERNAL FALL AND THE WILD BOULDER CHOKED RIVER CANYON THE TRAIL LEAVES THE VALLEY AT THE BASE OF THE SENTINEL ROCK
WAS FROM TWELVE TO FOURTEEN FEET WIDE THE MELTING SNOW AND ICE FORMED A NETWORK OF RILLS THAT RAN GRACEFULLY DOWN THE SURFACE OF THE GLACIER MERRILY SINGING IN THEIR SHINING CHANNELS
ANOTHER GRAND ONE DAY EXCURSION IS TO THE UPPER YOSEMITE FALL THE TOP OF THE HIGHEST OF THE THREE BROTHERS CALLED EAGLE PEAK ON THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MAPS THE BROW OF EL CAPITAN
AND ITS DEEPLY SCULPTURED FOUNTAIN PEAKS CALLED
BUT ON THE EAST A GENTLE ICE BURNISHED JUNIPER DOTTED SLOPE EXTENDS TO THE SUMMIT WHERE OTHER WONDERFUL VIEWS ARE DISPLAYED WHERE ALL ARE WONDERFUL THE SOUTH SIDE AND SHOULDERS OF HALF DOME AND CLOUDS REST
AWAKENING THE LAKES AND CRYSTALS
THE UPPER TUOLUMNE EXCURSION WE COME NOW TO THE GRANDEST OF ALL THE YOSEMITE EXCURSIONS ONE THAT REQUIRES AT LEAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS THE BEST TIME TO MAKE IT IS FROM ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF JULY
THAT ARE FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD STILL HOLDING BRAVELY TO LIFE MAKING THE MOST OF THEIR SLENDER SUMMERS SHAKING THEIR TASSELED NEEDLES IN THE BREEZE RIGHT CHEERILY
TO THE SOUTHWARD THERE IS A WELL DEFINED RANGE OF PALE GRAY EXTINCT VOLCANOES AND THOUGH THE HIGHEST OF THEM RISES NEARLY TWO THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LAKE YOU CAN LOOK DOWN FROM HERE INTO THEIR CIRCULAR CUP LIKE CRATERS
ANOTHER GRAND TWO DAY EXCURSION IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST OF THE ONE DAY TRIPS AS FAR AS THE HEAD OF ILLILOUETTE FALL
BETWEEN THE FALL AND A PLAIN MURAL CLIFF THAT IS BURNISHED HERE AND THERE BY GLACIAL ACTION YOU SHOULD STOP A WHILE ON A FLAT IRON FENCED ROCK A LITTLE BELOW THE HEAD OF THE FALL
WHERE FROM AN OUTJUTTING ROCK AT ITS HEAD YOU WILL GET A FINE VIEW OF ITS REJOICING WATERS AND WILD CANYON AND THE HALF DOME THENCE RETURNING TO THE TRAIL FOLLOW IT TO THE HEAD OF THE NEVADA FALL
LIKE ARTIFICIAL EMBANKMENTS COVERED WITH A MAGNIFICENT GROWTH OF SILVER FIR AND PINE BUT THIS GARDEN AND FOREST LUXURIANCE IS SPEEDILY LEFT BEHIND
BOUNDED BY ITS SNOWY PEAKS IN GLORIOUS ARRAY SOUTHWARD YOSEMITE AND WESTWARD THE VAST FOREST ON NO OTHER YOSEMITE PARK MOUNTAIN ARE YOU MORE LIKELY TO LINGER YOU WILL FIND IT A MAGNIFICENT SKY CAMP
LINGER HERE AN HOUR OR TWO FOR NOT ONLY HAVE YOU GLORIOUS VIEWS OF THE WONDERFUL FALL BUT OF ITS WILD LEAPING EXULTING RAPIDS
AND GREATER THAN ALL THE STUPENDOUS SCENERY INTO THE HEART OF WHICH THE WHITE PASSIONATE RIVER GOES WILDLY THUNDERING SURPASSING EVERYTHING OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD AFTER AN UNMEASURED HOUR OR SO OF THIS GLORY
A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWELVE MILES FORMING CHARMING SAUNTERING GROUNDS FROM WHICH THE GLORIOUS MOUNTAINS MAY BE ENJOYED AS THEY LOOK DOWN IN DIVINE SERENITY OVER THE DARK FORESTS THAT CLOTHE THEIR BASES
AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE FOOT OF THE WONDERFUL SERIES OF RIVER CATARACTS ALL OF THESE EXCURSIONS ARE SURE TO BE MADE MEMORABLE WITH JOYFUL HEALTH GIVING EXPERIENCES
EVENING CAME ON JUST AS I GOT FAIRLY INTO THE MAIN CANYON IT IS ABOUT A MILE WIDE AND A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO MILES LONG
FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN SHUTS IT IN ON THE EAST MY CAMP WAS ON THE BRINK OF ONE OF THE LAKES IN A THICKET OF MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK PARTLY SHELTERED FROM THE WIND
WHICH BROAD DEEP AND FAR REACHING EXERTED VAST INFLUENCE ON THE SCENERY OF THIS PORTION OF THE SIERRA BUT THERE ARE FINE CAMPING GROUNDS
SOME SPECIMENS THAT I MEASURED WERE OVER A HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND TWENTY FOUR FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SHOWING HARDLY A TRACE OF SEVERE STORMS LOOKING AS FRESH AND VIGOROUS AS THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER ZONES
THE GRAY PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL RANGE BOUNDS IT ON THE SOUTH A SIMILAR RANGE OR SPUR THE HIGHEST PEAK OF WHICH IS MOUNT CONNESS ON THE NORTH THE NOBLE MOUNTS DANA GIBBS MAMMOTH LYELL
EARLY NEXT MORNING I SET OUT TO TRACE THE ANCIENT GLACIER TO ITS HEAD PASSING AROUND THE NORTH SHORE OF MY CAMP LAKE I FOLLOWED THE MAIN STREAM FROM ONE LAKELET TO ANOTHER
RISING EARLY WHICH WILL BE EASY AS YOUR BED WILL BE RATHER COLD AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP MUCH ANYHOW AFTER VISITING THE GLACIER CLIMB THE RED MOUNTAIN AND ENJOY THE MAGNIFICENT VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT
THAT ONE MAY RIDE A MULE TO THE VERY SUMMIT ACROSS MANY A BUSY STREAM FROM MEADOW TO MEADOW LIES YOUR FLOWERY WAY MOUNTAINS ALL ABOUT YOU FEW OF THEM HIDDEN BY IRREGULAR FOREGROUNDS
A SHORT DISTANCE EAST OF PORCUPINE FLAT FROM THAT POINT PUSH STRAIGHT UP TO THE SUMMIT MOUNT HOFFMAN IS A MASS OF GRAY GRANITE THAT RISES ALMOST IN THE CENTER OF THE YOSEMITE PARK
THE EXCURSION TO THE TOP OF MOUNT DANA IS A VERY EASY ONE FOR THOUGH THE MOUNTAIN IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH THE ASCENT FROM THE WEST SIDE IS SO GENTLE AND SMOOTH
ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN MILES IN A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE VALLEY ITS SOUTHERN SLOPES ARE LOW AND EASILY CLIMBED AND ADORNED HERE AND THERE WITH CASTLE LIKE CRUMBLING PILES AND LONG JAGGED CRESTS
AND BEYOND ALL MARSHALED ALONG THE EASTERN HORIZON THE ICY SUMMITS ON THE AXIS OF THE RANGE AND BROAD SWATHS OF FORESTS GROWING ON ANCIENT MORAINES WHILE THE NEVADA VERNAL
AND OFFER NO APPRECIABLE RESISTANCE IN WALKING THROUGH THEM ALONG THE EDGES OF THE MEADOWS BENEATH THE PINES AND THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF THE VALLEY TALL RIBBON LEAVED GRASSES GROW IN ABUNDANCE CHIEFLY BROMUS
AND MANY A MEADOW ALONG THE CANYON STREAM THAT LINKS THEM TOGETHER THE MAIN LATERAL MORAINES THAT BOUND THE VIEW BELOW THE CANYON ARE FROM A HUNDRED TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND WONDERFULLY REGULAR
AND DOWN ITS FINE GRADES TO THE VALLEY ENJOYING GLORIOUS YOSEMITE SCENERY ALL THE WAY TO THE FOOT OF EL CAPITAN AND YOUR CAMP TWO DAY EXCURSIONS
THE FIRST OF THE SIXTY FIVE THAT I DISCOVERED IN THE SIERRA GLACIAL PHENOMENA IN THE ILLILOUETTE BASIN ARE ON THE GRANDEST SCALE AND IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPLORATIONS I FOUND
LINGER HERE IF NIGHT IS STILL DISTANT FOR VIEWS OF THIS FAVORITE FALL AND THE STUPENDOUS ROCK SCENERY ABOUT IT THEN DESCEND A STAIRWAY BY ITS SIDE FOLLOW A DIM TRAIL THROUGH ITS SPRAY
AND IF CURIOUS ABOUT SUCH THINGS YOU MAY DISCOVER SPECIMENS OF THIS HARDY TREE MOUNTAINEER NOT MORE THAN FOUR FEET HIGH AND ABOUT AS MANY INCHES IN DIAMETER AT THE GROUND
AND AS YOU SLOWLY SAUNTER FROM POINT TO POINT ALONG ITS MANY ACCOMMODATING ZIGZAGS NEARLY ALL THE VALLEY ROCKS AND FALLS ARE SEEN IN STRIKING EVER CHANGING COMBINATIONS
AND THOSE OF THE YOSEMITE ROCKS ESPECIALLY THE HALF DOME AND THE UPPER PART OF THE NORTH WALL ARE VERY FINE BUT OF COURSE FAR THE MOST IMPOSING VIEW IS THE VAST ARRAY OF SNOWY PEAKS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE
AS ON THE FOREGOING EXCURSION YOU LEAVE THE VALLEY BY THE YOSEMITE FALLS TRAIL
ALL ALONG THE MEADOWS AND ONE MAY MOVE FROM GROVE TO GROVE EVERY DAY ALL SUMMER ENJOYING NEW HOMES AND NEW BEAUTY TO SATISFY EVERY ROVING DESIRE FOR CHANGE
THE OTHER EASTWARD TO MOUNT DANA AND MOUNT GIBBS ALONG BOTH FORKS STRIPS OF MEADOW EXTEND ALMOST TO THEIR HEADS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PORTIONS OF THE MEADOWS ARE SPREAD OVER LAKE BASINS
ARE CONTINUED IN STRAGGLING MASSES ALONG THE WALLS
SOUTHEASTWARD THE STARR KING
THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE YOSEMITE VALLEY AND ITS MANY DOMES THE STARR KING CLUSTER OF DOMES SENTINEL DOME GLACIER POINT AND PERHAPS THE MOST TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSIVE OF ALL
YOU FOLLOW YOUR TRAIL WAY THROUGH SILVER FIR AND PINE WOODS TO EAGLE PEAK WHERE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE OF ALL THE VIEWS TO BE HAD ON THE NORTH WALL HEIGHTS ARE DISPLAYED AFTER AN HOUR OR TWO OF GAZING DREAMING
COMBINED WITH INEFFABLE FINENESS OF BEAUTY DRAGGING YOURSELF AWAY GO TO THE HEAD OF THE RIBBON FALL THENCE ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL RIBBON CREEK BASIN TO THE BIG OAK FLAT STAGE ROAD
AND FOLLOW THE DIVIDE TO CLOUDS REST AFTER A GLORIOUS VIEW FROM THE CREST OF THIS LOFTY GRANITE WAVE YOU WILL FIND A TRAIL ON ITS WESTERN END THAT WILL LEAD YOU DOWN PAST NEVADA AND VERNAL FALLS
FOR A TWO DAY TRIP I WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO MOUNT HOFFMAN SPEND THE NIGHT ON THE SUMMIT NEXT MORNING GO DOWN BY MAY LAKE TO TENAYA LAKE AND RETURN TO THE VALLEY BY CLOUD'S REST AND THE NEVADA AND VERNAL FALLS
FROM GLACIER POINT YOU LOOK DOWN THREE THOUSAND FEET OVER THE EDGE OF ITS SHEER FACE TO THE MEADOWS AND GROVES AND INNUMERABLE YELLOW PINE SPIRES
HAVE AT AN ELEVATION OF TEN THOUSAND FEET ONLY SMALL BROWN MATS OF CAREX LEAVING BARE ROCKS AROUND MORE THAN HALF THEIR SHORES YET
AND TO DAY ONE SEETH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN EVER YEA MINE ANIMALS ANSWERED HE YE COUNSEL ADMIRABLY AND ACCORDING TO MY HEART I WILL TO DAY ASCEND A HIGH MOUNTAIN
CAN LOVERS MOVE A HIGHER LAW IS LOVE FOR ORPHEUS WOE IS ME
THOU HONEY OF MY HEART BITE MY FISHING HOOK INTO THE BELLY OF ALL BLACK AFFLICTION LOOK OUT LOOK OUT MINE EYE OH HOW MANY SEAS ROUND ABOUT ME WHAT DAWNING HUMAN FUTURES
WHEN I TOUCHED IT IT SAID TO ME IN FIRM TONES LET ME ALONE I AM NOT FOR YOUR COLLECTION LIKE THESE PLANTS TO WHICH NATURE HAS GIVEN ONLY A SINGLE YEAR OF LIFE I AM A LITTLE OAK
FOR ONE DAY MUST IT YET COME AND MAY NOT PASS BY WHAT MUST ONE DAY COME AND MAY NOT PASS BY OUR GREAT HAZAR
A POSTURING WRATH SNORTER WITH WAITING A HOLY HOWL STORM FROM THE MOUNTAINS AN IMPATIENT ONE THAT SHOUTETH DOWN INTO THE VALLEYS HEARKEN ELSE I WILL SCOURGE YOU WITH THE SCOURGE OF GOD
THOU NOW BRINGEST TO THE SEARCH EYES QUICKER IN DISCERNING TRUTH BUT WHAT I SHALL SAY NEXT IS NO LESS PLAIN AND EASY TO SEE WHAT IS IT SAID I WHY SAID SHE
UNTIL BITING AT MY SHARP HIDDEN HOOKS THEY HAVE TO COME UP UNTO MY HEIGHT THE MOTLEYEST ABYSS GROUNDLINGS TO THE WICKEDEST OF ALL FISHERS OF MEN
BUT IN TWO ENTIRELY OPPOSITE WAYS ACCORDING AS IT IS HIS PHYSICAL OR HIS MENTAL STATURE THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE ONE WILL SEEM SMALLER THE FARTHER OFF YOU MOVE THE OTHER
AS THE ECHOES WAKEN ALL TAENARUS IS SHAKEN WHILST HE TO RUTH PERSUADES
EVERY ONE OF THEM ALIKE STANDING THERE SO ERECT AND BEARING THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE EAR
WOE UNTO ALL LOVING ONES WHO HAVE NOT AN ELEVATION WHICH IS ABOVE THEIR PITY THUS SPAKE THE DEVIL UNTO ME ONCE ON A TIME
THE MAN WHO GOES UP IN A BALLOON DOES NOT FEEL AS THOUGH HE WERE ASCENDING HE ONLY SEES THE EARTH SINKING DEEPER UNDER HIM THERE IS A MYSTERY
GREATER NATURE COVERS ALL HER WORKS WITH A VARNISH OF BEAUTY LIKE THE TENDER BLOOM THAT IS BREATHED AS IT WERE ON THE SURFACE OF A PEACH OR A PLUM
THE VULTURE TOO DOTH SPARE SOME LITTLE WHILE TO TEAR
TAKES VERY DIFFERENT SHAPES ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AT BOTTOM HE IS A MAN WHO CARES NOTHING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND ONLY STRIVES TO GAIN THE SEMBLANCE OF IT THAT HE MAY USE IT FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL ENDS
SINCE GOD IS RIGHTLY BELIEVED TO GOVERN ALL THINGS WITH THE RUDDER OF GOODNESS AND SINCE ALL THINGS DO LIKEWISE AS I HAVE TAUGHT HASTE TOWARDS GOOD BY THE VERY AIM OF NATURE CAN IT BE DOUBTED THAT HIS GOVERNANCE IS WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
OF WHAT ACCOUNT IS MY HAPPINESS ANSWERED HE I HAVE LONG CEASED TO STRIVE ANY MORE FOR HAPPINESS I STRIVE FOR MY WORK O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THE ANIMALS ONCE MORE
FOR IN A WORLD OF NEED AND IMPERFECTION EVERYTHING IS SEIZED UPON WHICH CAN BE USED TO SATISFY WANT NOTHING IS EXEMPT FROM THIS SERVICE NO
AND THE MANY AND IF IN THE END HE LOSES ALL PATIENCE HE CRUSHES BOTH THEM AND HIMSELF OR HE IS LIKE GULLIVER AT LILLIPUT
IT OUGHT TO EXIST FOR ITS OWN SAKE ALONE BUT BEFORE VERY LONG IT IS MISUSED TO SERVE ALIEN ENDS
FOURTH AND LAST PART AH WHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE THERE BEEN GREATER FOLLIES THAN WITH THE PITIFUL AND WHAT IN THE WORLD HATH CAUSED MORE SUFFERING THAN THE FOLLIES OF THE PITIFUL
SO RICH IS THE WORLD IN WONDERFUL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL ESPECIALLY THE HUMAN WORLD THE HUMAN SEA TOWARDS IT DO I NOW THROW OUT MY GOLDEN ANGLE ROD AND SAY OPEN UP
IN BODY LIKE TO A SPHERE ON ALL SIDES PERFECTLY ROUNDED IT ROLLS THE RESTLESS ORB OF THE UNIVERSE KEEPING ITSELF MOTIONLESS THE WHILE
FALLS CROUCHING AT HIS FEET THE DREAD AVENGERS TOO THAT GUILTY MINDS PURSUE WITH EVER HAUNTING FEARS ARE ALL DISSOLVED IN TEARS IXION ON HIS WHEEL A RESPITE
SO THAT I HAVE TO DAY ASCENDED THIS HIGH MOUNTAIN TO CATCH FISH DID EVER ANY ONE CATCH FISH UPON HIGH MOUNTAINS AND THOUGH IT BE A FOLLY WHAT I HERE SEEK AND DO
THAT IS TO SAY OUR GREAT REMOTE HUMAN KINGDOM THE ZARATHUSTRA KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS HOW REMOTE MAY SUCH REMOTENESS BE WHAT DOTH IT CONCERN ME
WHICH ONLY THOSE WILL UNDERSTAND WHO FEEL THE TRUTH OF IT YOUR ESTIMATION OF A MAN'S SIZE WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE DISTANCE AT WHICH YOU STAND FROM HIM
RICH SEA A SEA FULL OF MANY HUED FISHES AND CRABS FOR WHICH EVEN THE GODS MIGHT LONG AND MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO BECOME FISHERS IN IT AND CASTERS OF NETS
THEN HE LAUGHED FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART LOOKED AROUND HIM AND SPAKE THUS THAT I SPAKE OF SACRIFICES AND HONEY SACRIFICES IT WAS MERELY A RUSE IN TALKING AND VERILY
FOR THIS AM I FROM THE HEART AND FROM THE BEGINNING DRAWING HITHER DRAWING UPWARD DRAWING UPBRINGING A DRAWER A TRAINER A TRAINING MASTER
AND FROM THIS THOU DIDST GO ON TO ADD AS BY THE WAY THE PROOF THAT NO ONE WOULD BE HAPPY UNLESS HE WERE LIKEWISE GOD AGAIN THOU DIDST SAY THAT THE VERY FORM OF GOOD WAS THE ESSENCE BOTH OF GOD
YOU HAVE THE ASTRONOMER AND THE PHILOSOPHER WISDOM WHICH IS ONLY THEORETICAL AND NEVER PUT INTO PRACTICE IS LIKE A DOUBLE ROSE
THEN SAID I WITH ALL MY HEART I AGREE WITH PLATO INDEED THIS IS NOW THE SECOND TIME THAT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO MY MIND FIRST I LOST THEM THROUGH THE CLOGGING CONTACT OF THE BODY
SUFFERED TO REMAIN ONLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO GETTING RID OF THEM AND YET BUT FOR THESE FLOWERS THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO CHARM THE EYE IN THAT WILDERNESS OF STALKS THEY ARE EMBLEMATIC OF
OUT ON THE SEA AND AWAY BEYOND SINUOUS ABYSSES THEN WENT HIS ANIMALS THOUGHTFULLY ROUND ABOUT HIM AND AT LAST SET THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF HIM
OF HIS SONG ONE SOLE CONDITION YET UPON THE BOON IS SET LET HIM NOT TURN HIS EYES TO VIEW HIS HARD WON PRIZE TILL THEY SECURELY PASS THE GATES OF HELL ALAS WHAT LAW
THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DISPERSE HOWEVER THE COLD DROVE THEM TOGETHER AGAIN WHEN JUST THE SAME THING HAPPENED AT LAST AFTER MANY TURNS OF HUDDLING AND DISPERSING
BUT SEE THAT HONEY IS THERE READY TO HAND YELLOW WHITE GOOD ICE COOL GOLDEN COMB HONEY FOR KNOW THAT WHEN ALOFT I WILL MAKE THE HONEY SACRIFICE
ONCE ON A TIME BECOME WHAT THOU ART THUS MAY MEN NOW COME UP TO ME FOR AS YET DO I AWAIT THE SIGNS THAT IT IS TIME FOR MY DOWN GOING
I CALL BY THE NAME WHICH ALL RECOGNISE GOD THEN SAID SHE SEEING THAT SUCH IS THY BELIEF IT WILL COST ME LITTLE TROUBLE I THINK TO ENABLE THEE TO WIN HAPPINESS AND RETURN IN SAFETY TO THY OWN COUNTRY
IT WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOTENT THERE IS NOTHING THEN WHICH HAS EITHER THE WILL OR THE POWER TO OPPOSE THIS SUPREME GOOD NO I THINK NOT SO THEN
BUT WHEN WINTER COMES YOU WILL BE BARED OF YOUR GLORY AND I SHALL BE AS I AM NOW ONCE AS I WAS BOTANIZING UNDER AN OAK
LO THOU SITTEST IN THY PITCH WHAT DO YE SAY MINE ANIMALS SAID ZARATHUSTRA LAUGHING VERILY I REVILED WHEN I SPAKE OF PITCH
LONG BEFORE WE ENTER UPON LIFE ITSELF AND WHEN AFTERWARDS WE COME TO SEE THE WORKS OF NATURE FOR OURSELVES THE VARNISH IS GONE THE ARTISTS HAVE USED IT UP AND WE HAVE ENJOYED IT IN ADVANCE
AS HUNTSMEN AND FISHERMEN REQUIRE IT FOR IF THE WORLD BE AS A GLOOMY FOREST OF ANIMALS AND A PLEASURE GROUND FOR ALL WILD HUNTSMEN IT SEEMETH TO ME RATHER AND PREFERABLY A FATHOMLESS
UNTO WHICH ALL WINDS COME AS UNTO THE STORM PARTING ASKING WHERE AND WHENCE AND WHITHER HERE LAUGH LAUGH MY HEARTY HEALTHY WICKEDNESS FROM HIGH MOUNTAINS CAST DOWN THY GLITTERING SCORN LAUGHTER
NOT EVEN THOSE VERY THINGS WHICH ARISE ONLY WHEN NEED AND WANT ARE FOR A MOMENT LOST SIGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE TRUE SOUGHT FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
BUT MOST OF ALL AT THESE VERY WORDS WHICH THOU USEST I AM NOW AT LAST ASHAMED OF THE FOLLY THAT SO SORELY VEXED ME THOU HAST HEARD THE STORY OF THE GIANTS ASSAILING HEAVEN
ERSTWHILE THOU DIDST CONFESS THYSELF IGNORANT WHAT IS THAT SAID I THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WORLD'S GOVERNMENT SAID SHE YES I REMEMBER MY CONFESSION AND
AND WILL NOT LEAVE ME AND IS LIKE MOLTEN PITCH THEN WENT HIS ANIMALS AGAIN THOUGHTFULLY AROUND HIM AND PLACED THEMSELVES ONCE MORE IN FRONT OF HIM O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THEY
SAID SHE IT IS THE SUPREME GOOD WHICH RULES IN STRENGTH AND GRACIOUSLY DISPOSES ALL THINGS THEN SAID I HOW DELIGHTED AM I AT THY REASONINGS AND THE CONCLUSION TO WHICH THOU HAST BROUGHT THEM
UNTO THE CLEARER DAY IF ON THE DARKNESS PAST ONE BACKWARD LOOK YE CAST YOUR WEAK AND WANDERING EYES
ONE OF THEM DID NOTHING BUT STUDY THE MACHINERY AND HE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT HOW IT WAS WORKED THE OTHER TRIED TO GET AT THE MEANING OF THE PIECE IN SPITE OF HIS IGNORANCE OF THE LANGUAGE HERE
A SQUANDERER WITH A THOUSAND HANDS HOW COULD I CALL THAT SACRIFICING AND WHEN I DESIRED HONEY I ONLY DESIRED BAIT AND SWEET MUCUS AND MUCILAGE
AND EVEN DURING THE HOURS DEVOTED TO SLUMBER THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WHICH I MADE SEEMED TO ATTRACT THE NOTICE OF THOSE WHO SHARED THE MATS WITH ME IN SPITE OF THESE OBSTACLES HOWEVER I DETERMINED FORTHWITH TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT
AND WHEN OPENED THEY ARE FOUND TO BE ABOUT TWO THIRDS FULL OF AN OINTMENT OF A LIGHT YELLOW COLOUR AND DIFFUSING THE SWEETEST PERFUME THIS ELEGANT LITTLE ODOROUS GLOBE WOULD NOT BE OUT OF PLACE EVEN UPON THE TOILETTE OF A QUEEN
HE SAID YOU TABOO WHY YOU NO LIKE TO STAY PLENTY MOEE MOEE SLEEP PLENTY KI KI EAT PLENTY WAHENEE YOUNG GIRLS OH VERY GOOD PLACE TYPEE
AND HAS FOUR OR FIVE STOPS WITH A LARGE HOLE NEAR ONE END WHICH LATTER IS HELD JUST BENEATH THE LEFT NOSTRIL THE OTHER NOSTRIL BEING CLOSED BY A PECULIAR MOVEMENT OF THE MUSCLES ABOUT THE NOSE THE BREATH IS FORCED INTO THE TUBE
FROM THE EXTRAVAGANT VALUE PLACED UPON THE ARTICLE I VERILY BELIEVE THAT WITH A BUSHEL OF COMMON LIVERPOOL SALT ALL THE REAL ESTATE IN TYPEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED WITH A SMALL PINCH OF IT IN ONE HAND
THE LEAF DROOPING ON ONE SIDE WITH ITS FORWARD HALF TURNED JAUNTILY UP ON THE BROWS AND THE REMAINING PART SPREADING LATERALLY BEHIND THE EARS
IT WAS IN FAYAWAY'S DELICATE LITTLE HANDS ONE OF THE MOST GRACEFUL I HAVE EVER SEEN A YOUNG LADY IN THE ACT OF TORMENTING A GUITAR STRUNG ABOUT HER NECK BY A COUPLE OF YARDS OF BLUE RIBBON IS NOT HALF SO ENGAGING
TO RESCUE ME FROM A CONDITION THAT HAD NOW BECOME INSUPPORTABLE AS HE DREW NEAR I REMEMBERED WITH MANY MISGIVINGS THE INAUSPICIOUS TERMINATION OF OUR FORMER INTERVIEW AND WHEN HE ENTERED THE HOUSE I WATCHED WITH INTENSE ANXIETY
HOW TRUE IT IS THAT THE RARITY OF ANY PARTICULAR ARTICLE ENHANCES ITS VALUE AMAZINGLY IN SOME PART OF THE VALLEY I KNOW NOT WHERE BUT PROBABLY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE SEA
THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE GATHERED TOGETHER ON THE MATS
HIS NATIVE VALLEY AND THAT HE INTENDED TO RETURN TO IT THE SAME DAY AT ONCE IT STRUCK ME THAT COULD I BUT REACH THAT VALLEY UNDER HIS PROTECTION I MIGHT EASILY FROM THENCE REACH NUKUHEVA BY WATER AND ANIMATED BY THE PROSPECT WHICH THIS PLAN HELD OUT
THE FLICKERING RAYS OF THE ARMOR NUT JUST SERVED TO REVEAL THEIR SAVAGE LINEAMENTS WITHOUT DISPELLING THE DARKNESS THAT HOVERED ABOUT THEM
AS NOT ONE OF THE NATIVES HAD SOUL ENOUGH IN HIM TO STAND UP LIKE A MAN AND ALLOW ME TO HAMMER AWAY AT HIM FOR MY OWN PERSONAL GRATIFICATION AND THAT OF THE KING I WAS NECESSITATED TO FIGHT WITH AN IMAGINARY ENEMY
AT MY REQUEST MY MATS WERE ALWAYS SPREAD DIRECTLY FACING THE DOOR OPPOSITE WHICH AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WAS THE HUT OF BOUGHS THAT MARHEYO WAS BUILDING WHENEVER MY GENTLE FAYAWAY AND KORY KORY
BUT WHEN I DID SO MY VALET ALWAYS ROSE WITH ME AS IF DETERMINED I SHOULD NOT REMOVE MYSELF FROM HIS OBSERVATION FOR THE PRESENT THEREFORE I WAS OBLIGED TO ABANDON THE ATTEMPT BUT I ENDEAVOURED TO CONSOLE MYSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT BY THIS MODE
WOULD COMMENCE A LOW DISMAL AND MONOTONOUS CHANT ACCOMPANYING THE VOICE WITH THE INSTRUMENTAL MELODY PRODUCED BY TWO SMALL HALF ROTTEN STICKS TAPPED SLOWLY TOGETHER A PAIR OF WHICH WERE HELD IN THE HANDS OF EACH PERSON PRESENT
AND YOU RUN AWAY SHIP NO MORE WITH THESE WORDS ENFORCED BY A VEHEMENCE OF GESTURE I CANNOT DESCRIBE MARNOO STARTED FROM MY SIDE AND IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH SOME OF THE CHIEFS WHO HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE
GLOOMILY PONDERING OVER THE FATE WHICH IT APPEARED NOW IDLE FOR ME TO RESIST WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE LOVED FRIENDS WHO WERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THE SAVAGE ISLAND IN WHICH I WAS HELD A CAPTIVE
AFTER BATHING AS THEY SOMETIMES DO FIVE OR SIX TIMES EVERY DAY THE HAIR IS CAREFULLY DRIED AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE SEA INVARIABLY WASHED IN FRESH WATER AND ANOINTED WITH A HIGHLY SCENTED OIL EXTRACTED FROM THE MEAT OF THE COCOANUT
WHETHER AGAINST THE EXPRESS WILL OF PROVIDENCE IT IS TWISTED UPON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND THERE COILED AWAY LIKE A ROPE ON A SHIP'S DECK WHETHER IT BE STUCK BEHIND THE EARS AND HANGS DOWN LIKE THE SWAG OF A SMALL WINDOW CURTAIN
IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING AND EVENING AND TREATING IT TO A BATH NO WONDER THAT THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDERS ARE SO AMPHIBIOUS A RACE WHEN THEY ARE THUS LAUNCHED INTO THE WATER AS SOON AS THEY SEE THE LIGHT
AND A QUARTER SECTION OF A BREAD FRUIT IN THE OTHER THE GREATEST CHIEF IN THE VALLEY WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT ALL LUXURIES OF A PARISIAN TABLE THE CELEBRITY OF THE BREAD FRUIT TREE AND THE CONSPICUOUS PLACE IT OCCUPIES IN A TYPEE BILL OF FARE
CONSISTS IN PLACING ANY NUMBER OF THE FRESHLY PLUCKED FRUIT WHEN IN A PARTICULAR STATE OF GREENNESS AMONG THE EMBERS OF A FIRE IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD ROAST A POTATO AFTER THE LAPSE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES THE GREEN RIND EMBROWNS AND CRACKS
WHEN I OBSERVED A WOMAN SITTING UPON A ROCK IN THE MIDST OF THE CURRENT AND WATCHING WITH THE LIVELIEST INTEREST THE GAMBOLS OF SOMETHING WHICH AT FIRST I TOOK TO BE AN UNCOMMONLY LARGE SPECIES OF FROG THAT WAS SPORTING IN THE WATER NEAR HER
ENVELOPED IN MULTITUDINOUS FOLDS OF LEAVES AND AS A SPECIAL MARK OF THE ESTEEM IN WHICH THEY HELD ME WOULD SPREAD AN IMMENSE LEAF ON THE GROUND AND DROPPING ONE BY ONE A FEW MINUTE PARTICLES OF THE SALT UPON IT INVITE ME TO TASTE THEM
THIS IS THE FORM IN WHICH THE TUTAO IS GENERALLY CONSUMED THE SINGULAR MODE OF EATING IT I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED WERE IT NOT THAT THE BREAD FRUIT IS THUS CAPABLE OF BEING PRESERVED FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
WERE THREE MAGNIFICENT BREAD FRUIT TREES AT THIS MOMENT I CAN RECAP TO MY MIND THEIR SLENDER SHAFTS AND THE GRACEFUL INEQUALITIES OF THEIR BARK ON WHICH MY EYE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DWELL DAY AFTER DAY
FEARFUL OF DISTURBING THE SLUMBERING NATIVES AND TAKING THE FAN FROM MY HAND WOULD SIT BEFORE ME SWAYING IT GENTLY TO AND FRO AND GAZING EARNESTLY INTO MY FACE
THE FLEETING SHADES OF THE EXPIRING DOLPHIN THE AUTUMNAL TINTS OF OUR AMERICAN FORESTS GLORIOUS AS THEY ARE SINK INTO NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THIS TREE
BUT I WAS NOW PROMOTED TO THE PLACE OF COURT MINSTREL IN WHICH CAPACITY I WAS AFTERWARDS PERPETUALLY CALLED UPON TO OFFICIATE BESIDES THE STICKS AND THE DRUMS
THUS WOULD THEY EMPLOY THEMSELVES FOR AN HOUR OR TWO SOMETIMES LONGER LYING IN THE GLOOM WHICH WRAPPED THE FURTHER END OF THE HOUSE I COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING AT THEM
ITS SURFACE IS DOTTED ALL OVER WITH LITTLE CONICAL PROMINENCES LOOKING NOT UNLIKE THE KNOBS ON AN ANTIQUATED CHURCH DOOR THE RIND IS PERHAPS AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS AND DENUDED OF THIS
GRASPING THE CALABASH ON HEARING MY REPLY THEY SANK BACK AGAIN AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO I RETURNED TO MY MAT ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE SAVAGES TURNING RESTLESSLY
STIR UP THE MIXTURE WHICH THEY CALL BO A SHO I NEVER COULD ENDURE THIS COMPOUND AND INDEED THE PREPARATION IS NOT GREATLY IN VOGUE AMONG THE MORE POLITE TYPEES THERE IS ONE FORM HOWEVER IN WHICH THE FRUIT IS OCCASIONALLY SERVED
AND AT ONCE TAKE THE ROUTE TO PUEEARKA THE VERY NIGHT WHICH FOLLOWED MARNOO'S DEPARTURE I PROCEEDED TO PUT THIS PROJECT INTO EXECUTION ABOUT MIDNIGHT AS I IMAGINED I AROSE AND DREW THE SLIDE
THE ACTION OF THE OVEN HAVING CONVERTED IT INTO AN AMBER COLOURED CAKY SUBSTANCE A LITTLE TART BUT NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO THE TASTE BY ANOTHER AND FINAL PROCESS THE AMAR IS CHANGED INTO POEE POEE
FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING VARIOUS SPECIES OF RARE SEA WEED SOME OF WHICH AMONG THESE PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERED A GREAT LUXURY AFTER A WHOLE DAY SPENT IN THIS EMPLOYMENT HE WOULD RETURN ABOUT NIGHTFALL WITH SEVERAL COCOANUT SHELLS FILLED WITH DIFFERENT DESCRIPTIONS OF KELP
IT WAS ALSO BY NIGHT ALONE THAT I COULD HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH MY OBJECT AND THEN ONLY BY ADOPTING THE UTMOST PRECAUTION THE ENTRANCE TO MARHEYO'S HABITATION WAS THROUGH A LOW NARROW OPENING IN ITS WICKER WORK FRONT
ITS MERITS AS A PREPARATION FOR THE HAIR ARE UNDENIABLE
THE FRUIT SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES IN MAGNITUDE AND GENERAL APPEARANCE ONE OF OUR CITRON MELONS OF ORDINARY SIZE BUT UNLIKE THE CITRON IT HAS NO SECTIONAL LINES DRAWN ALONG THE OUTSIDE
THIS STATELY TREE WHICH IS RARELY MET WITH UPON THE SANDWICH ISLANDS AND THEN ONLY OF A VERY INFERIOR QUALITY AND AT TAHITI DOES NOT ABOUND TO A DEGREE THAT RENDERS ITS FRUIT THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF FOOD
OR WHETHER IT BE PERMITTED TO FLOW OVER THE SHOULDERS IN NATURAL RINGLETS IT IS ALWAYS THE PRIDE OF THE OWNER AND THE GLORY OF THE TOILETTE THE TYPEE GIRLS DEVOTE MUCH OF THEIR TIME TO THE DRESSING OF THEIR FAIR AND REDUNDANT LOCKS
YOU SEE AH BY BY YOU NO MIND YOU GET WELL HE KILL YOU EAT YOU HANG YOU HEAD UP THERE LIKE HAPPAR KANAKA NOW YOU LISTEN BUT NO TALK ANY MORE BY BY I GO YOU SEE WAY I GO
AND SHAVEN HEADS DISPOSED IN A CIRCLE
INDUCES ME TO GIVE AT SOME LENGTH A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE TREE AND THE VARIOUS MODES IN WHICH THE FRUIT IS PREPARED THE BREAD FRUIT TREE IN ITS GLORIOUS PRIME IS A GRAND AND TOWERING OBJECT
THAT RENDERS IT A DISH FIT FOR A KING AS SOON AS IT IS TAKEN FROM THE FIRE THE EXTERIOR IS REMOVED THE CORE EXTRACTED AND THE REMAINING PART IS PLACED IN A SORT OF SHALLOW STONE MORTAR AND BRISKLY WORKED WITH A PESTLE OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE
SADLY DISCURSIVE AS I HAVE ALREADY BEEN I MUST STILL FURTHER ENTREAT THE READER'S PATIENCE AS I AM ABOUT TO STRING TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT ORDER A FEW ODDS AND ENDS OF THINGS NOT HITHERTO MENTIONED
WITH A VIEW OF CAREFULLY NOTING THE PATH HE WOULD TAKE IN LEAVING THE VALLEY
AND THE NEXT MOMENT BE CLASPED TO ITS MOTHER'S BOSOM THIS WAS REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE BABY REMAINING IN THE STREAM ABOUT A MINUTE AT A TIME ONCE OR TWICE IT MADE WRY FACES AT SWALLOWING A MOUTHFUL OF WATER
TO SAVAGES GENERALLY IS IMPUTED A GUTTURAL ARTICULATION THIS HOWEVER IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE ESPECIALLY AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE POLYNESIAN ARCHIPELAGO
AND LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY AT ME EXCLAIMED NOW YOU SEE YOU DO WHAT I TELL YOU AH THEN YOU DO GOOD YOU NO DO SO AH THEN YOU DIE
LAYING THEMSELVES DOWN BESIDE ME WOULD LEAVE ME AWHILE TO UNINTERRUPTED REPOSE I TOOK A STRANGE INTEREST IN THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENTS OF THE ECCENTRIC OLD WARRIOR ALL ALONE DURING THE STILLNESS OF THE TROPICAL MID DAY
THE RECEPTION HE MET WITH FROM ITS INMATES TO MY JOY HIS APPEARANCE WAS HAILED WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND ACCOSTING ME KINDLY HE SEATED HIMSELF BY MY SIDE AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE NATIVES AROUND HIM
WITH WHICH THEY SET TO IN COLUMN AND PUMMELLED ONE ANOTHER AT THE WORD OF COMMAND ONE DAY IN COMPANY WITH KORY KORY I HAD REPAIRED TO THE STREAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF BATHING
FREQUENTLY SUSPENDING HIS EMPLOYMENT AND NOTICING MY MELANCHOLY EYE FIXED UPON HIM HE WOULD RAISE HIS HAND WITH A GESTURE EXPRESSIVE OF DEEP COMMISERATION AND THEN MOVING TOWARDS ME SLOWLY WOULD ENTER ON TIP TOES
WAS SOON OUT OF SIGHT A MODE OF ESCAPE WAS NOW PRESENTED TO ME BUT HOW WAS I TO AVAIL MYSELF OF IT I WAS CONTINUALLY SURROUNDED BY THE SAVAGES I COULD NOT STIR FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER WITHOUT BEING ATTENDED BY SOME OF THEM
GIVING A MUSICAL PROLONGATION TO THE FINAL SYLLABLE OF EVERY SENTENCE AND CHIRPING OUT SOME OF THE WORDS WITH A LIQUID BIRD LIKE ACCENT WAS SINGULARLY PLEASING
BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN CASES WHERE THEY DID NOT SUCCEED AS HAPPENED WHEN THEY MARCHED AGAINST THE TOWN OF NATA HE SAYS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE AFFAIR AND AMPLIFIES ONLY THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR SUCCESSES BUT THE PIRATES ROUTED THE HORSEMEN
HE DID SO WITH THE IDEA OF FOUNDING THERE A PERMANENT PIRATE PRINCIPALITY THE INHABITANTS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ENGLISH FRENCH OR DUTCH BUT PLAIN PIRATES HAVING A NATIONALITY AND COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN
IT WAS NECESSARY TO START OUT AGAIN AND COMMIT SOME MORE ACTS OF ROBBERY AND RUIN AND L'OLONNOIS WHOSE RAPACIOUS MIND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH A DESIRE FOR TOWN DESTROYING PROJECTED AN EXPEDITION TO NICARAGUA
AND THEY OCCUPIED PART OF THE TIME IN GARDENING PLANTING FRENCH BEANS WHICH CAME TO MATURITY IN SIX WEEKS AND GAVE THEM SOME FRESH VEGETABLES
ON WHICH HE WISHED TO LAND IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE AN ACCOUNT OF STOCK AND DIVIDE THE PROFITS THIS THE PIRATES ALWAYS DID AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THEY HAD CONCLUDED ONE OF THEIR NEFARIOUS ENTERPRISES BUT HIS MEN WERE NOT AT ALL SATISFIED WITH WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ISLAND
WORSE THAN ANYTHING THEY HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE NOW THE EIGHT SHIPS WITH THEIR DEMON CREWS SAILED AWAY OVER THE LAKE TOWARD MARACAIBO IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET OUT TO SEA WITHOUT REVISITING THIS UNFORTUNATE TOWN
THESE BLOODY PIRATES HAD ALWAYS CONQUERED IN THEIR DESPERATE FIGHTS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO RECKLESS AND SO SAVAGE BUT NOW THEY HAD FALLEN AMONG THOROUGHBRED SAVAGES MORE CRUEL AND MORE BRUTAL AND PITILESS THAN THEMSELVES
IT WAS AT LAST ARRANGED THAT THE CITIZENS SHOULD PAY TWENTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WHICH WAS THE UTMOST SUM THEY COULD POSSIBLY RAISE AND IN ADDITION TO THIS FIVE HUNDRED HEAD OF BEEF CATTLE
THEIR VOYAGE WAS A VERY LONG ONE AND THEY WERE BESET BY CALMS AND INSTEAD OF REACHING NICARAGUA THEY DRIFTED INTO THE GULF OF HONDURAS HERE THEY FOUND THEMSELVES NEARLY OUT OF PROVISIONS
WHICH GREW IN ABUNDANCE IN THOSE REGIONS IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT CATCH HIMSELF A SUPPER WHEN HE REACHED THE SEA AFTER A TIME THE BUCCANEERS GOT BACK TO THEIR FLEET AND REMAINED ON THE COAST ABOUT THREE MONTHS
WHERE THEY HOPED TO BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT IF THEY COULD FIND NOTHING ELSE THEY MIGHT AT LEAST CATCH FISH ON THEIR WAY EVERY RASCAL OF THEM PREPARED HIMSELF A NET
A NEGRO WAS CAPTURED WHO CARRIED LETTERS FROM THE GOVERNOR OF SANTIAGO A NEIGHBORING CITY
THEY DEVASTATED LITTLE TOWNS TAKING EVERYTHING THAT THEY CARED FOR AND BURNING WHAT THEY DID NOT WANT AND TREATING THE PEOPLE THEY CAPTURED WITH VILER CRUELTIES THAN ANY IN WHICH THE BUCCANEERS HAD YET INDULGED
THESE LATTER WERE APPORTIONED AMONG THE MEN IN THE MOST RIDICULOUS MANNER THE PIRATES HAVING NO IDEA OF THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE JEWELS SOME OF THEM PREFERRING LARGE AND WORTHLESS COLORED STONES TO SMALLER DIAMONDS AND RUBIES WHEN ALL THEIR WICKEDLY GAINED PROPERTY HAD BEEN DIVIDED
CHAPTER SIXTEEN A PIRATE POTENTATE SOMETIME IN THE LAST HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ON A QUIET FARM IN A SECLUDED PART OF WALES THERE WAS BORN A LITTLE BOY BABY
THE FLEET SAILED DIRECTLY FOR SAINT CATHERINE AN ISLAND NEAR COSTA RICA WHICH WAS STRONGLY FORTIFIED BY THE SPANIARDS AND USED BY THEM AS A STATION FOR AMMUNITION AND SUPPLIES AND ALSO AS A PRISON
SO HE LEFT THE ROAD MARCHED HIS MEN INTO THE WOODS LED THEM ENTIRELY AROUND THE BARRICADES AND THEN AFTER PROCEEDING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE EMERGED UPON A WIDE PLAIN WHICH LAY BEFORE THE TOWN
AND PROMISED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIM TO JAMAICA AND DELIVER HIM TO JUSTICE BUT THE FRENCHMEN DECLINED TO BE SATISFIED THEY HAD RECEIVED BUT VERY LITTLE MONEY AFTER THEY HAD PILLAGED A RICH TOWN AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THEIR ENGLISH COMPANIONS WERE INCLINED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IN EVERY WAY
AND MADE BREAD FROM SOME WHEAT WHICH WAS AMONG THEIR PROVISIONS THUS MANAGING TO LIVE VERY WELL L'OLONNOIS WAS NEVER INTENDED BY NATURE TO BE A BOAT BUILDER OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WAS USEFUL AND HONEST AND WHEN THE BOAT WAS FINISHED IT WAS DISCOVERED
AND REACHED THE MOUTH OF THE NICARAGUA RIVER THERE HIS PARTY WAS ATTACKED BY SOME SPANIARDS AND INDIANS WHO KILLED MORE THAN HALF OF THEM AND PREVENTED THE OTHERS FROM LANDING
THEY SOLD THEIR VALUABLE MERCHANDISE FOR A TWENTIETH PART OF ITS VALUE TO SOME OF THE MORE LEVEL HEADED PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND HAVING RIOTED GAMBLED AND COMMITTED EVERY SORT OF EXTRAVAGANCE FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS
HAD THE SEED THUS PLANTED BY MANSVELT AND MORGAN GROWN AND MATURED IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT THE WHOLE OF THE WEST INDIES MIGHT NOW BE OWNED AND INHABITED BY AN INDEPENDENT NATION WHOSE FOUNDERS WERE THE BOLD BUCCANEERS
THE CLAIMS OF THE WOUNDED WERE FULLY SATISFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR ESTABLISHED CODE FOR THE LOSS OF A RIGHT ARM A MAN WAS PAID ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SIX SLAVES FOR THE LOSS OF A LEFT ARM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FIVE SLAVES
BUT WENT TO THE COAST OF CARTAGENA THE PIRATES LEFT ON THE ISLAND WERE EVENTUALLY TAKEN OFF BY A BUCCANEERING VESSEL BUT L'OLONNOIS HAD NOW REACHED THE END OF THE STRING BY WHICH THE DEVIL HAD ALLOWED HIM TO GAMBOL ON THIS EARTH FOR SO LONG A TIME
THIS WAS GIVEN AND THE TIME WAS OCCUPIED BY THE PEOPLE IN RUNNING AWAY INTO THE WOODS AND CARRYING OFF THEIR VALUABLES BUT WHEN THE TWO HOURS HAD EXPIRED L'OLONNOIS AND HIS MEN ENTERED THE TOWN AND INSTEAD OF RUMMAGING AROUND TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD FIND
HE DEPARTED WITH SEVEN HUNDRED MEN AND SIX SHIPS STOPPING ON THE WAY NEAR THE COAST OF CUBA AND ROBBING SOME POOR FISHERMEN OF THEIR BOATS WHICH HE WOULD NEED IN SHALLOW WATER
THEY HAD HEARD OF L'OLONNOIS AND HIS BUCCANEERS AND WHEN THEY FOUND THIS NOTORIOUS PIRATE UPON THEIR SHORES
AND ABILITY AS A LEADER THE BUCCANEERS PROCEEDED TO MAKE VERY GOOD USE OF THEIR VICTORY THEY CAPTURED SOME SMALL ADJOINING ISLANDS AND BROUGHT THE CANNON FROM THEM TO THE MAIN FORTRESS
AND ACCORDING TO THESE CURIOUS REGULATIONS THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF PLUNDER WAS APPORTIONED AMONG THE OFFICERS AND CREWS OF THE DIFFERENT SHIPS BEFORE THE REGULAR ALLOTMENT OF SHARES WAS MADE
AND WERE OBLIGED TO LAND AND SCOUR THE COUNTRY TO FIND SOMETHING TO EAT LEAVING THEIR SHIPS THEY BEGAN A LAND MARCH THROUGH THE UNFORTUNATE REGION WHERE THEY NOW FOUND THEMSELVES THEY ROBBED INDIANS THEY ROBBED VILLAGES
AND THEREFORE COULD GIVE NO INFORMATION TO THEIR BRUTAL INQUISITORS AND OTHERS DIED WITHOUT TELLING WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH THEIR VALUABLES WHEN THE TOWN HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY SEARCHED AND SIFTED THE PIRATES SENT MEN OUT
NOW L'OLONNOIS PROPOSED TO HIS MEN THAT THEY SHOULD SAIL FOR GUATEMALA BUT HE MET WITH AN UNEXPECTED OBSTACLE THE BUCCANEERS WHO HAD ENLISTED UNDER HIM HAD EXPECTED TO MAKE GREAT FORTUNES IN THIS EXPEDITION
OF THIS MONSTER IF IN HIS INFANCY HE HAD DIED OF CROUP
AND AMONG THEIR SPOILS WERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SLAVES OF ALL AGES AND BOTH SEXES WHO HAD BEEN OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY TO RANSOM THEMSELVES BUT WHO OF COURSE HAD NO MONEY WITH WHICH TO BUY THEIR FREEDOM AND WHO WERE NOW CONDEMNED TO A CAPTIVITY
BUT THEY WERE NOT EXTINGUISHED UNTIL A QUARTER OF THE TOWN WAS ENTIRELY BURNED AND A FINE CHURCH REDUCED TO ASHES WHEN THE BUCCANEERS FOUND THEY COULD SQUEEZE NOTHING MORE OUT OF THE TOWN THEY WENT ON BOARD THEIR SHIPS CARRYING WITH THEM ALL THE PLUNDER AND BOOTY THEY HAD COLLECTED
NO MORE DREADFUL MISERIES COULD BE CONCEIVED THAN THOSE INFLICTED UPON THE PEACEFUL INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THESE WRETCHES PASSED
THE FRENCHMAN CHALLENGED THE ENGLISHMAN BUT THE LATTER BEING A MEAN SCOUNDREL TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIS OPPONENT UNFAIRLY STABBED HIM IN THE BACK AND KILLED HIM NOW ALL THE FRENCHMEN IN THE COMPANY ROSE IN FURIOUS PROTEST
AND THE ONLY THING LEFT TO BE DONE WAS TO DECIDE WHAT PARTICULAR PLACE THEY SHOULD FAVOR WITH A VISIT THERE WERE SOME WHO ADVISED AN ATTACK UPON HAVANA GIVING AS A REASON THAT IN THAT CITY THERE WERE A GREAT MANY NUNS MONKS AND PRIESTS
SO STRONG WAS HIS DISLIKE THAT WHEN HE BECAME A YOUNG MAN HE RAN AWAY TO THE SEACOAST FOR HE HAD A FANCY TO BE A SAILOR THERE HE FOUND A SHIP BOUND FOR THE WEST INDIES AND IN THIS HE STARTED OUT ON HIS LIFE'S CAREER
WAITING FOR SOME EXPECTED SPANISH SHIPS WHICH THEY HOPED TO CAPTURE THEY EVENTUALLY MET WITH ONE AND AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF ORDINARY FIGHTING AND STRATAGEM THEY BOARDED AND TOOK HER BUT FOUND HER NOT A VERY VALUABLE PRIZE
WHEN YOUNG MORGAN REACHED THE BARBADOES HE WAS RESOLD TO A PLANTER AND DURING HIS TERM OF SERVICE HE PROBABLY WORKED A GOOD DEAL HARDER AND WAS TREATED MUCH MORE ROUGHLY THAN ANY OF THE LABORERS ON HIS FATHER'S FARM
AND THEN HE SENT SOME MESSENGERS ASHORE TO INFORM THE ALREADY HALF RUINED CITIZENS THAT UNLESS THEY SENT HIM THIRTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT HE WOULD ENTER THEIR TOWN AGAIN CARRY AWAY EVERYTHING THEY HAD LEFT AND BURN THE PLACE TO THE GROUND THE POOR CITIZENS
FOUND THEMSELVES AS POOR AS WHEN THEY HAD STARTED OFF ON THEIR EXPEDITION IT TOOK THEM ALMOST AS LONG TO DIVIDE THEIR SPOILS AS IT DID TO GET RID OF THEM AS THESE PRECIOUS RASCALS HAD NOW NOTHING TO LIVE UPON
SENT A COMMITTEE TO CONFER WITH THE PIRATES AND WHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE GOING ON SOME OF THE CONSCIENCELESS BUCCANEERS WENT ON SHORE AND CARRIED OFF FROM ONE OF THE GREAT CHURCHES ITS IMAGES PICTURES AND EVEN ITS BELLS
RETURNING FROM ONE OF HIS VOYAGES MORGAN FOUND AN OLD BUCCANEER NAMED MANSVELT IN JAMAICA WHO HAD GATHERED TOGETHER A FLEET OF VESSELS
THE PIRATES SAILED TO TORTUGA WHERE THEY PROCEEDED WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME TO GET RID OF THE WEALTH THEY HAD AMASSED THEY ATE THEY DRANK THEY GAMBLED THEY CROWDED THE TAVERNS AS TAVERNS HAVE NEVER BEEN CROWDED BEFORE
WHICH HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED BY THE MEN WHO HAD BEEN GATHERING THE CROP WHEN MORGAN'S FLEET ARRIVED AT THE NEAREST HARBOR TO PORT AU PRINCE
THAT UNLESS IN THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS A RANSOM OF TEN THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WERE PAID TO THEM THEY WOULD BURN THE TOWN TO THE GROUND NO MATTER WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THIS HEARTLESS DEMAND IT WAS NOT EASY FOR THE SCATTERED CITIZENS TO COLLECT SUCH A SUM AS THIS
BUT AS SOON AS HE WAS A FREE MAN HE WENT TO JAMAICA AND THERE WERE FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE A YOUNG MAN COULD BE MORE FREE AND MORE INDEPENDENT THAN IN THIS LAWLESS ISLAND HERE WERE ROLLICKING AND BLUSTERING
IF THEY HAD BEEN ATTACKED FROM ABOVE BY MEANS OF BALLOONS OR FROM BELOW BY MINES AND EXPLOSIVES THEY WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE ADAPTED THEIR STYLE OF DEFENCE TO THE METHOD OF ATTACK THEY ALWAYS DID THIS AND ACCORDING TO ESQUEMELING THEY NEARLY ALWAYS GOT THE BETTER OF THEIR ENEMIES
NO OTHER BUCCANEERING VESSEL WAS SO WIDELY KNOWN AND SO GREATLY FEARED AND THE ENGLISH PEOPLE IN THESE REGIONS WERE AS PROUD OF THE YOUNG CAPTAIN MORGAN AS IF HE HAD BEEN A REGULARLY COMMISSIONED ADMIRAL CRUISING AGAINST AN ACKNOWLEDGED ENEMY
SO THAT HE COULD HOLD THE ISLAND AS A REGULAR STATION FOR THE ASSEMBLING AND FITTING OUT OF PIRATE VESSELS THE PERMANENT PIRATE COLONY NEVER CAME TO ANYTHING NO REENFORCEMENTS WERE SENT MANSVELT DIED
BUT HE DELIBERATELY SELECTED HIS PROFESSION AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO ACQUIRE A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS PRACTICE THERE WAS A BUCCANEER SHIP ABOUT TO SAIL FROM JAMAICA AND ON THIS MORGAN ENLISTED HE WAS A CLEVER FELLOW
MORGAN ESTIMATED THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE BOOTY TO BE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WHEN THIS COMPARATIVELY SMALL SUM WAS DIVIDED MANY OF THE MEN COMPLAINED THAT IT WOULD NOT GIVE THEM ENOUGH TO PAY THEIR DEBTS IN JAMAICA THEY WERE UTTERLY ASTONISHED
THIS EXPEDITION SEEMED A PROMISING ONE TO MORGAN AND HE JOINED IT BEING ELECTED VICE ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET OF FIFTEEN VESSELS SINCE THE SUCCESSES OF L'OLONNOIS AND OTHERS ATTACKS UPON TOWNS HAD BECOME VERY POPULAR WITH THE BUCCANEERS
WHERE HE PROPOSED TO PILLAGE AND DEVASTATE AS MANY TOWNS AND VILLAGES AS POSSIBLE HIS REPUTATION AS A SUCCESSFUL COMMANDER WAS NOW SO HIGH THAT HE HAD NO TROUBLE IN GETTING MEN FOR MORE OFFERED THEMSELVES THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY TAKE
HOWEVER MUCH ONE TABULATED WAS YET A MYSTERY THERE WERE ALWAYS SOME PEOPLE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLACE FREDERICK WAS ONE OF THEM HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BEAR THE REMOTEST RESEMBLANCE TO THE ORIGINAL FREDERICK
BUT NO SOUND CAME OR IF IT DID THE CRACKLING OF THE FIRE COVERED IT UP SHE MUST GO NEARER SHE BEGAN TO CREEP TOWARDS HIM SOFTLY SOFTLY HE DID NOT MOVE
SHE WAS STARING STRAIGHT INTO THE FIRE AND IT WAS NO DOUBT THE FIRE THAT MADE HER FACE SO RED I AM THINKING HE REPEATED RAISING HIS CLEAR CULTIVATED VOICE AND SPEAKING WITH ACERBITY
LOTTY WOULD HAVE REMOVED IT BY THE FRANK COMMENTS SHE MADE WHILE SHE AND ROSE SAT TOGETHER AFTER TEA ON THE WALL LOTTY WAS DELIGHTED AT MORE LOVE BEING INTRODUCED INTO SAN SALVATORE EVEN IF IT WERE ONLY ONE SIDED
BY JUST AN INCOHERENT STRANGER IT WAS INDEED DISTURBING SHE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND HER SUDDEN LONGING
DRAWING ROOM DOOR WAS OPEN AND THE HOUSE WAS QUIET WITH THE HUSH THAT PRECEDES DINNER WHEN THE INHABITANTS ARE ALL SHUT UP IN THEIR ROOMS DRESSING BRIGGS IN HIS ROOM
SHE HAD TRIED IN DAYS GONE BY TO THINK THE SITUATION OUT TO DISCOVER THE EXACT RIGHT COURSE FOR HER TO TAKE BUT HAD FOUND IT AS SHE HAD FOUND FREDERICK TOO DIFFICULT AND HAD LEFT IT
HE TOLD MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AS A MATTER OF HONOUR NOT TO MENTION IT AND AT LEAST HER LITTLE HOUSE WAS NOT HAUNTED BY THE LOOSE LIVED LADIES FOR FREDERICK DID HIS WORK AWAY FROM HOME HE HAD TWO ROOMS NEAR THE BRITISH MUSEUM
AND OUTSIDE THE DEEP SLITS OF WINDOWS HUNG THE BLUE CURTAIN OF THE NIGHT HOW PRETTY WHAT A SWEET PLACE SAN SALVATORE WAS AND THAT GORGEOUS LILAC ON THE TABLE
HOW GAY IT LOOKED THE FIRE TRANSFORMED THE ROOM A DARK UGLY ROOM IN THE DAYTIME IT WAS TRANSFORMED JUST AS SHE HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED BY THE WARMTH OF
AND FOUND HERSELF MORE TANGLED IN DOUBTS THAN EVER MISSUS WILKINS ON THE CONTRARY HAD NO DOUBTS SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS A MOST PROPER THING TO HAVE A HOLIDAY AND ALTOGETHER RIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL
SHE MUST GO AND PUT HER FACE IN IT BUT SHE NEVER GOT TO THE LILAC SHE WENT ONE STEP TOWARDS IT AND THEN STOOD STILL FOR SHE HAD SEEN THE FIGURE LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW IN THE FARTHEST CORNER
CHAPTER TWENTY SCRAP WANTED TO KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT HER MOTHER THAT ARUNDEL HAD PRESENTLY TO INVENT HE WOULD TALK ABOUT ANYTHING SHE WISHED
FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST TILL ONE HAD HAD MORE TIME DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THE EXACT RIGHT WORDS WERE A SUGGESTION THAT IT WOULD DO NO HARM TO ANSWER THE ADVERTISEMENT NON COMMITTAL MERE INQUIRY
AND ALSO ANY CHARMING FUNNY THINGS THAT HAD BEEN DONE OR MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE FOR HE COULD IMAGINE ALMOST ANYTHING SCRAP'S EYES GREW ROUND WITH WONDER AND AFFECTIONATE PRIDE IN HER MOTHER
EACH ONE CONVINCED THAT THEY NEEDED CONTRIBUTIONS THEMSELVES SHE LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE WERE HIDING SOMETHING DISCREDITABLE BUT DELIGHTFUL CERTAINLY HER CUSTOMARY CLEAR EXPRESSION OF CANDOR WAS NOT THERE
BUT OF COURSE IT COULDN'T GO ON ONCE CAROLINE APPEARED ROSE KNEW HER PLACE SHE COULD SEE AS WELL AS ANY ONE THE UNUSUALLY
A HAD A HOUSE THERE IN FACT MISSUS WILKINS DRIVEN BY TERROR GUILT AND SURPRISE HAD BEEN MORE INCOHERENT IF POSSIBLE THAN USUAL
SHE HUNG HIM UP FINALLY BY HER BEDSIDE AS THE CHIEF SUBJECT OF HER PRAYERS AND LEFT HIM EXCEPT FOR THOSE ENTIRELY TO GOD SHE HAD LOVED FREDERICK TOO DEEPLY
AND SHE FELT AFRAID AND SHE HAD ALL THE FEELINGS THOUGH THIS SHE DID NOT KNOW OF A WOMAN WHO WAS COME AWAY FROM A SECRET MEETING WITH HER LOVER THAT INDEED WAS WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE
LIVING FOR OTHERS AND PRAYER AND THE PEACE TO BE FOUND IN PLACING ONESELF UNRESERVEDLY IN GOD'S HANDS TO MEET ALL THESE WORDS MISSUS WILKINS HAD OTHER WORDS INCOHERENT AND YET
SURE AS SHE SO MISERABLY WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO ANYTHING SHE DID SHE MERELY WROTE HIM A NOTE AND PUT IT ON THE HALL TABLE READY FOR HIM IF AND WHEN HE SHOULD COME HOME
SOON SHE WOULD BE BACK WITH THEM AGAIN AND WHAT WOULD A CAMELLIA BEHIND HER EAR SEEM LIKE THEN SIMPLY FANTASTIC BUT ON ONE THING SHE WAS DETERMINED
I MUST TRY AND HELP HER NOT TO ALOUD SHE SAID GRAVELY I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU INSIST THAT I'M NOT HAPPY WHEN YOU KNOW ME BETTER I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT I AM
AS SHE HAD LEFT FREDERICK TO GOD NOTHING OF THIS MONEY WAS SPENT ON HER HOUSE OR DRESS THOSE REMAINED EXCEPT FOR THE GREAT SOFT SOFA AUSTERE
WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS MISTER WILKINS COMING BACK DAILY TO HIS DINNER AND EATING HIS FISH IN THE SILENCE OF IMAGINED SECURITY
BOX ONE THOUSAND THE TIMES FOR PARTICULARS SHE ASKED FOR ALL PARTICULARS BUT THE ONLY ONE THEY REALLY WANTED WAS THE ONE ABOUT THE RENT THEY BOTH FELT THAT IT WAS MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WHO OUGHT TO WRITE THE LETTER AND DO THE BUSINESS PART
THEN HE WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR AT BREAKFAST HAVING LET HIMSELF IN WITH HIS LATCHKEY THE NIGHT BEFORE VERY JOVIAL AND GOOD NATURED AND FREE HANDED AND GLAD IF SHE WOULD ALLOW HIM TO GIVE HER SOMETHING A WELL FED MAN CONTENTED WITH THE WORLD
AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SHE WAS UNABLE TO LOOK ANYBODY IN THE FACE SHE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM MAKING SPEECHES APPEALING FOR MONEY HOW COULD SHE STAND UP AND ASK PEOPLE FOR MONEY
OH NO NOT TILL APRIL SAID MISSUS ARBUTHNOT OVER HER SHOULDER VERY ODD THOUGHT THE VICAR VERY ODD INDEED AND HE WENT HOME AND WAS NOT PERHAPS QUITE CHRISTIAN
NEVERTHELESS SEEMED TO HER TO BE THE ONE WHO IMPELLED INCOHERENT SHE YET IMPELLED SHE APPEARED TO HAVE APART FROM HER NEED OF HELP AN UPSETTING KIND OF CHARACTER
AS THEY TURNED AWAY FROM THE LETTER BOX HOW IMMACULATELY GOOD WE'VE BEEN ALL OUR LIVES
PERHAPS THEY NEED A HOLIDAY SUGGESTED MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AN UNSATISFACTORY A QUEER REPLY THE VICAR THOUGHT IN FEBRUARY HE CALLED AFTER HER SARCASTICALLY
SHE LOOKED AT HER LITTLE CLOCK STILL TEN MINUTES BEFORE DINNER TIRED OF STAYING IN HER BEDROOM SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD GO ON TO MISSUS FISHER'S BATTLEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE EMPTY AT THIS HOUR
TO SPEND ONE'S OWN HARD COLLECTED SAVINGS ON BEING HAPPY
FOR INATTENTION AT SUCH A MOMENT WAS DEPLORABLE OF TAKING YOU TO ITALY FOR EASTER DID YOU NOT HEAR ME YES SHE HAD HEARD HIM
FANCY MOTHER WHAT AN OLD DARLING DID SHE REALLY DO THAT HOW PERFECTLY ADORABLE OF HER AND DID SHE REALLY SAY BUT HOW WONDERFUL OF HER TO THINK OF IT
NOT A SINGLE OFFICIAL AT CALAIS CARED A FIG FOR MELLERSH IN PARIS THERE WAS NO TIME TO THINK OF HIM BECAUSE THEIR TRAIN WAS LATE
THERE SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DIRECT TO LEAD TO ADVISE TO SUPPORT EXCEPT FREDERICK SHE LONG SINCE HAD LEARNED TO LEAVE FREDERICK TO GOD BEING LED HERSELF BEING INFLUENCED AND THROWN OFF HER FEET BY JUST AN ADVERTISEMENT
TIED TOGETHER BY A BLUE ENAMEL RIBBON ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN GOLD LETTERS ESTO PERPETUA MISTER WILKINS WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED BRUSHING HIS WIFE'S HAIR
HOW SHE HAD BEEN INVITED A FRIEND HAD INVITED HER EASTER TOO EASTER WAS IN APRIL WASN'T IT
ONE WOMAN BEING HAPPY AND THESE PITEOUS MULTITUDES SHE WAS UNABLE TO LOOK THE VICAR IN THE FACE HE DID NOT KNOW NOBODY KNEW WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO
AND AT THE END OF THE MEETING HER EYES
AND MISTER ARUNDEL STILL WENT ON AMUSING HER AND IT WAS A QUARTER TO EIGHT BEFORE SHE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED DINNER OH GOOD HEAVENS SHE EXCLAIMED JUMPING UP YES IT'S LATE SAID ARUNDEL
WHICH WAS THE SCENE OF HIS EXHUMATIONS AND THERE HE WENT EVERY MORNING AND HE CAME BACK LONG AFTER HIS WIFE WAS ASLEEP SOMETIMES HE DID NOT COME BACK AT ALL SOMETIMES SHE DID NOT SEE HIM FOR SEVERAL DAYS TOGETHER
SHE KNEW HE OFTEN HAD NO IDEA OF HAVING DONE IT FOR A PERSON WHO WROTE BOOKS THOUGHT ROSE FREDERICK DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH IMAGINATION ANYHOW SHE SAID TO HERSELF
I AM THINKING OF TAKING YOU TO ITALY FOR EASTER AND PAUSED FOR HER ASTOUNDED AND GRATEFUL ECSTASY NONE CAME THE SILENCE IN THE ROOM
MISSUS ARBUTHNOT SPOKE ON AND ON
ARUNDEL FOLLOWED HE DID NOT WISH TO ARRIVE TOO HOT SO HAD TO GO SLOWLY FORTUNATELY HE WAS NEAR THE TOP AND FRANCESCA CAME DOWN THE PERGOLA TO PILOT HIM INDOORS
SO THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PUBLISH A BOOK OF MEMOIRS DURING EACH YEAR OF HIS MARRIED LIFE AND EVEN SO THERE WERE GREATER FURTHER PILES OF THESE LADIES WAITING TO BE DEALT WITH MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WAS HELPLESS
WHAT SORT OF A FACE DID LLOYD GEORGE MAKE SHE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND HAD A GREAT LONGING TO HUG HER MOTHER AND THE TIME FLEW AND IT GREW QUITE DUSK AND IT GREW NEARLY DARK
IN ORDER TO ANSWER HER INQUIRES AND KEEP HER THERE TO HIMSELF HE PROCEEDED TO INVENT IT WAS QUITE EASY TO FASTEN SOME OF THE ENTERTAINING THINGS HE WAS CONSTANTLY THINKING ON TO OTHER PEOPLE
WHEN SHE HERSELF WAS SPENDING SO MUCH ON HER OWN SELFISH PLEASURE NOR DID IT HELP HER OR QUIET HER THAT HAVING ACTUALLY TOLD FREDERICK IN HER DESIRE TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT SHE WAS SQUANDERING THAT SHE WOULD BE GRATEFUL
WAS THROWING AWAY SPOILT TIE AFTER SPOILT TIE SCRAP IN HERS WAS HURRYING INTO A BLACK FROCK WITH A VAGUE NOTION THAT MISTER BRIGGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE HER SO CLEARLY IN BLACK
OF LADY CAROLINE HOW WARM THOUGH THINGS LIKE ADMIRATION AND APPRECIATION MADE ONE FEEL HOW CAPABLE OF REALLY DESERVING THEM HOW DIFFERENT HOW GLOWING
AND PRETEND THEY WERE THEIRS SCRAP WHO HAD THAT AFFECTION FOR HER PARENTS WHICH WARMS IN ABSENCE WAS ATHIRST FOR NEWS AND BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED BY THE NEWS HE GRADUALLY IMPARTED
CROSS EXAMINED HER WITH THE UTMOST SEVERITY HE DEMANDED THAT SHE REFUSE THE INVITATION HE DEMANDED THAT SINCE SHE HAD SO OUTRAGEOUSLY ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM
HE COULDN'T DO NOTHIN WITH EM ALL HE THINKS OF WHEN HE SEES A CROWD IS HOW TO MARCH EM TIS ALL VERY WELL WHEN HE DON'T TEMPT TOO MUCH HE NEVER DID ACT LIKE OTHER FOLKS
CONFERENCE IN PLATOONS AND GOT EM ALL FLUSTERED UP TRYIN TO SENSE HIS IDEAS OF A HOLLER SQUARE SHE BURST FORTH
HAS SUCH A POWER OF SURVIVAL THAT I FELT ALL THE TIME AS IF ONE MUST TRY TO MAKE THE OCCASION EASY FOR SOME ONE WHO WAS YOUNG AND NEW TO THE AFFAIRS OF SOCIAL LIFE HE ASKED POLITELY IF I WOULD LIKE TO GO UP TO THE GREAT LEDGE
THERE WAS NO MORE TIME FOR CONVERSATION UNTIL WE WERE SEATED IN ORDER AT THE LONG TABLES I'M ONE THAT ALWAYS DREADS SEEING SOME O THE FOLKS THAT I DON'T LIKE AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS
WITH A SIMPLE KINDNESS THAT WAS THE SOUL OF CHIVALRY WAITED UPON US AND OUR BASKETS AND LED AWAY THE WHITE HORSE I ALREADY KNEW SOME OF MISSUS TODD'S FRIENDS AND KINDRED AND FELT LIKE AN ADOPTED BOWDEN IN THIS HAPPY MOMENT
OUT OF THE CHATTERING CROWD OF NOISY CHILDREN AND LARGE WAISTED WOMEN WHOSE BEST BLACK DRESSES FELL STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND IN GENEROUS FOLDS AND SUNBURNT MEN WHO LOOKED AS SERIOUS AS IF IT WERE TOWN MEETING DAY
THERE THEY'RE CALLIN OUT IT'S TIME TO SET THE TABLES SAID MISSUS CAPLIN WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT HERE'S COUSIN SARAH JANE BLACKETT WELL I AM PLEASED CERTAIN
GOOD FOR NOTHING ELSE MOST O HIS TIME TROUBLE IS HE I TURNED WITH INTEREST TO HEAR THE WORST MISSUS CAPLIN'S TONE WAS BOTH ZEALOUS AND IMPRESSIVE STIM'LATES SHE EXPLAINED SCORNFULLY
YET STILL BE HEARD WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COMPANY OF ANCIENT GREEKS GOING TO CELEBRATE A VICTORY OR TO WORSHIP THE GOD OF HARVESTS IN THE GROVE ABOVE IT WAS STRANGELY MOVING TO SEE THIS AND TO MAKE PART OF IT
AND STRAYING OUT PRESENTLY I FOUND THE HOE BY THE WELL HOUSE AND AN OLD SPLINT BASKET AT THE WOODSHED DOOR AND ALSO FOUND MY WAY DOWN TO THE FIELD WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT SQUARE PATCH OF ROUGH WEEDY POTATO TOPS AND TALL RAGWEED
ANSWERED MISSUS TODD HE'S A GOOD SIGHT BETTER COMPANY THOUGH DREAMY THAN SUCH SORDID CREATUR'S AS MARI HARRIS LIVE AND LET LIVE SAID DEAR OLD MISSUS BLACKETT GENTLY I HAVEN'T SEEN THE CAPTAIN FOR A GOOD WHILE
I'VE HAD TO FAVOR OLD MIS EVINS WITH DRYIN YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS ALL THEM EVINS FOLKS THERE JUST YOU LOOK UP TO THE CROSSROADS MOTHER SHE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED SEE ALL THE TEAMS AHEAD OF US
HE DON'T OFTEN HAVE SUCH A CHANCE TO SHOW OFF HIS GIFTS SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A FRIEND FROM THE LANDING WHO HAD JOINED US THAT'S SANT BOWDEN HE ALWAYS TAKES THE LEAD SUCH DAYS
WILLIAM MISSUS TODD HAD TAKEN THE ONION OUT OF HER BASKET AND LAID IT DOWN UPON THE KITCHEN TABLE THERE'S JOHNNY BOWDEN COME WITH US YOU KNOW SHE REMINDED HER MOTHER HE'LL BE HUNGRY ENOUGH TO EAT HIS SIZE
BUT WHEN AT LONG INTERVALS THE ALTARS TO PATRIOTISM TO FRIENDSHIP TO THE TIES OF KINDRED ARE REARED IN OUR FAMILIAR FIELDS THEN THE FIRES GLOW THE FLAMES COME UP
I COULD PLAINLY HEAR HER GREET HIM GOT ROUND TO COMIN IN DIDN'T YOU SHE INQUIRED WITH AMUSEMENT WELL NOW THAT'S CLEVER DIDN'T KNOW'S I SHOULD SEE YOU TO DAY WILLIAM AN I WANTED TO SETTLE AN ACCOUNT
HE WAS ABLE TO PURSUE THEM WITH MORE OR LESS PLEASURE HE WAS ABOUT SIXTY AND NOT YOUNG LOOKING FOR HIS YEARS
HE PICKED A FEW SPRIGS OF LATE BLOOMING LINNAEA AS WE CAME OUT UPON AN OPEN BIT OF PASTURE AT THE TOP OF THE ISLAND AND GAVE THEM TO ME WITHOUT SPEAKING BUT HE KNEW AS WELL AS I THAT ONE COULD NOT SAY HALF HE WISHED ABOUT LINNAEA
THE MINISTER STOOD THERE IN THE PULPIT TRYIN TO KEEP SOBER AN ALL AT ONCE HE BURST RIGHT OUT LAUGHIN HE WAS A VERY NICE MAN THEY SAID AND HE SAID HE'D BETTER GIVE EM THE BENEDICTION AND THEY COULD HEAR THE SERMON NEXT SUNDAY
THEN WE MOVED EASILY TOWARD THE HOUSE TOGETHER SPEAKING OF THE FINE WEATHER AND OF MACKEREL WHICH WERE REPORTED TO BE STRIKING IN ALL ABOUT THE BAY WILLIAM HAD BEEN OUT SINCE THREE O'CLOCK AND HAD TAKEN AN EXTRA FARE OF FISH
BUT THEY WERE NOT MANY SO I SAID TO MYSELF THEIR ANCESTORS MAY HAVE SAT IN THE GREAT HALL OF SOME OLD FRENCH HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN BATTLES AND SIEGES AND PROCESSIONS AND FEASTS
IN BOTH HER APPEARANCE AND HER CHARMING GIFTS
BEFORE ME MOST BUSINESSLIKE AND INTENT UPON HIS ERRAND WE WENT FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE FIELD ABOVE THE HOUSE INTO A SMOOTH BROWN PATH AMONG THE DARK SPRUCES THE HOT SUN BROUGHT OUT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE PITCHY BARK
I TOLD HIM ONCE THE COUNTRY'D LOST A GREAT GENERAL AN I MEANT IT TOO I EXPECT YOU'RE NEAR RIGHT SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A LITTLE CRESTFALLEN AND APOLOGETIC I BE RIGHT INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH MUCH
I BEGAN TO RESPECT THE BOWDENS FOR THEIR INHERITANCE OF GOOD TASTE AND SKILL AND A CERTAIN PLEASING GIFT OF FORMALITY SOMETHING MADE THEM DO ALL THESE THINGS IN A FINER WAY THAN MOST COUNTRY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DONE THEM
INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH SOME EXCITEMENT
LAND SAKES ALIVE
WE RANKED BY FOURS AND EVEN THEN WE MADE A LONG PROCESSION THERE WAS A WIDE PATH MOWED FOR US ACROSS THE FIELD AND AS WE MOVED ALONG
I ALWAYS DID THINK MARI HARRIS RESEMBLED A CHINEE MARI HARRIS WAS PRETTY AS A CHILD I REMEMBER SAID THE PLEASANT VOICE OF MISSUS BLACKETT WHO AFTER RECEIVING THE AFFECTIONATE GREETINGS OF NEARLY THE WHOLE COMPANY
MISSUS TODD HAD TAKEN OFF HER WARM GLOVES AND LOOKED THE PICTURE OF CONTENT THERE SHE EXCLAIMED I'VE ALWAYS MEANT TO HAVE YOU SEE THIS PLACE BUT I NEVER LOOKED FOR SUCH A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY
THAT ANY OCCASION OF GENERAL INTEREST PROVES TO BE LESS THAN GREAT SUCH IS THE HIDDEN FIRE OF ENTHUSIASM IN THE NEW ENGLAND NATURE THAT ONCE GIVEN AN OUTLET IT SHINES FORTH
SERENE AND MINDFUL OF PRIVILEGE AND RESPONSIBILITY THE MISTRESS BY SIMPLE FITNESS OF THIS GREAT DAY MISSUS TODD LOOKED UP AT THE ROOF OF GREEN TREES AND THEN CAREFULLY SURVEYED THE COMPANY
THERE WAS AN INSTANT CRY OF REJOICING AND TWO OR THREE PERSONS RAN TOWARD US FROM THE BUSY GROUP WHY DEAR MIS BLACKETT HERE'S MIS BLACKETT I HEARD THEM SAY AS IF IT WERE PLEASURE ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY TO HAVE A SIGHT OF HER
WEATHER AN OCCASION BOTH MADE TO MATCH YES IT SUITS ME I DON'T ASK NO MORE I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU SAW MOTHER WALKIN AT THE HEAD IT CHOKED ME RIGHT UP TO SEE MOTHER AT THE HEAD WALKIN WITH THE MINISTERS
I SEE EM BETTER NOW THEY'RE ALL SETTIN DOWN SHE SAID WITH SATISFACTION
AND HELD IT CAPTIVE ONE SEES EXACTLY THE SAME TYPES IN A COUNTRY GATHERING AS IN THE MOST BRILLIANT CITY COMPANY
STEALING A GLANCE AT ME THERE'S ONE THING CERTAIN THERE'S NOTHING TAKES IN THIS WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE ANYTHING RELATED TO THE BOWDENS YES I DO FEEL
BEYOND THE FIELDS AND COVE A HIGHER POINT OF LAND RAN OUT INTO THE BAY COVERED WITH WOODS WHICH MUST HAVE KEPT AWAY MUCH OF THE NORTHWEST WIND IN WINTER
THE BIRDS FLEW UP OUT OF THE THICK SECOND CROP OF CLOVER AND THE BEES HUMMED
SOMEBODY OBSERVED ONCE THAT YOU COULD PICK OUT THE LIKENESS OF MOST EVERY SORT OF A FOREIGNER WHEN YOU LOOKED ABOUT YOU IN OUR PARISH SAID SISTER CAPLIN HER FACE BRIGHTENING WITH SUDDEN ILLUMINATION I DIDN'T SEE THE BEARIN OF IT THEN QUITE SO PLAIN
AND LENDS SOME BEAUTY TO THE PLAINEST FACE OH I EXPECT I SHALL MEET FRIENDS TODAY THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN IN A LONG WHILE SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH DEEP SATISFACTION
WHICH WAS BUT THE REFLECTED LIGHT FROM HER BEAMING COUNTENANCE IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS FULL OF WONDER AT THE WASTE OF HUMAN ABILITY IN THIS WORLD AS A BOTANIST WONDERS AT THE WASTEFULNESS OF NATURE THE THOUSAND SEEDS THAT DIE
CAME TO JOIN US TO SEE AS SHE INSISTED THAT WE WERE OUT OF MISCHIEF YES MARI WAS ONE O THEM PRETTY LITTLE LAMBS THAT MAKE DREADFUL HOMELY OLD SHEEP REPLIED MISSUS TODD WITH ENERGY CAP'N LITTLEPAGE
I WISH THEY WERE SITTIN WITH US THEY'RE NOT AMONG FOLKS THEY CAN PARLEY WITH AN THEY LOOK DISAPPOINTED AS THE FEAST WENT ON THE SPIRITS OF MY COMPANION STEADILY ROSE
SHE STOOD UP IN THE HIGH WAGON TO SEE EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN SHE TOOK FAST HOLD OF MY HAND HADN'T YOU BETTER URGE THE HORSE A LITTLE ALMIRY SHE ASKED HE'S HAD IT EASY AS WE CAME ALONG
SHE HAD SIMPLY GROWN SLUGGISH FOR LACK OF PROPER SURROUNDINGS SHE WAS NOT SO MUCH REMINISCENT NOW AS EXPECTANT AND AS ALERT AND GAY AS A GIRL WE WHO WERE HER NEIGHBORS WERE FULL OF GAYETY
WE NEVER HAD FITS NONE OF US AND TWAS LUCKY WE DIDN'T WAY OUT THERE TO GREEN ISLAND NOW THESE FOLKS RIGHT IN FRONT
I WAS SURE THAT MISSUS BLACKETT MUST BE WAITING IMPATIENTLY TO SLICE THE POTATOES INTO THE CHOWDER LAYER AFTER LAYER WITH THE FISH YOU LET ME TAKE HOLT O THAT BASKET MA'AM SAID THE PLEASANT ANXIOUS VOICE BEHIND ME I TURNED
TWOULDN'T HURT HER TO SIT DOWN AN HEAR HIS GREAT STORIES ONCE IN A WHILE THE STORIES ARE VERY INTERESTING I VENTURED TO SAY YES YOU ALWAYS CATCH YOURSELF A THINKIN WHAT IF THEY ALL WAS TRUE AND HE HAD THE RIGHT OF IT
I EXPECT YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSE A SOMEWHAT LARGER FISH BUT I'LL TRY AN MAKE IT DO I SHALL HAVE TO HAVE A FEW EXTRA POTATOES BUT THERE'S A FIELD FULL OUT THERE AN THE HOE'S LEANIN AGAINST THE WELL HOUSE
AND HE CAN REST WHEN WE GET THERE THE OTHERS ARE SOME LITTLE WAYS AHEAD AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE A MINUTE WE WATCHED THE BOATS DROP THEIR SAILS ONE BY ONE IN THE COVE AS WE DROVE ALONG THE HIGH LAND
BUT HE WILL HAVE THOSE POOR GLOOMY SPELLS COME OVER HIM NOW AN THEN AN THEN HE HAS TO DRINK MISSUS CAPLIN GAVE A HEAVY SIGH THERE'S A GREAT MANY SUCH STRAYAWAY FOLKS
AND THE SHADE WAS PLEASANT AS WE CLIMBED THE HILL WILLIAM STOPPED ONCE OR TWICE TO SHOW ME A GREAT WASPS' NEST CLOSE BY OR SOME FISHHAWKS' NESTS BELOW IN A BIT OF SWAMP
TURNED AWAY TO HIDE THE FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT INSTANTLY CONTROL WHO WAS THE MARSHAL I HASTENED TO ASK WAS HE AN OLD SOLDIER DON'T HE DO WELL ANSWERED MISSUS TODD WITH SATISFACTION
I COUNTED THREE OR FOUR THAT WERE BAFFLED BY THE LIGHT BREEZE BUT BEFORE LONG ALL THE BOWDENS SMALL AND GREAT SEEMED TO HAVE ASSEMBLED AND WE STARTED TO GO UP TO THE GROVE ACROSS THE FIELD
I REMEMBER THE DAY I PROMISED TO NATHAN HOW IT COME OVER ME
THE BOWDEN REUNION IT IS VERY RARE IN COUNTRY LIFE
HAD MADE HIS HOME THERE AND IT WAS STILL THE BOWDEN FARM FIVE GENERATIONS OF SAILORS AND FARMERS AND SOLDIERS HAD BEEN ITS CHILDREN AND PRESENTLY MISSUS BLACKETT
RIGHT FOR WILLIAM'S FISH HOUSE FIVE MILES OUT ON GREEN ISLAND OR UP THERE ON BURNT ISLAND WHERE THE SIGNAL IS HE HAD IT ALL OVER TO ME ONE DAY AN I TRIED HARD TO APPEAR INTERESTED HIS LIFE'S ALL IN IT
