WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT I DON'T IT'S VERLOC WHO SAYS THAT A LYING DOG OF SOME SORT SAID MISTER VLADIMIR IN SOMEWHAT ORIENTAL PHRASEOLOGY
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER PAUSED IN HIS SPECULATIONS TO REFLECT FOR A MOMENT THOUGH HOW IN THAT LAST CASE HE COULD HOPE TO HAVE HIS OWN SHARE IN THE BUSINESS CONCEALED IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL HE CONTINUED IN HIS IGNORANCE OF POOR STEVIE'S DEVOTION TO MISTER VERLOC
HE MIGHT HAVE HOPED THAT THE FELLOW WOULD GET CLEAR AWAY IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING THIS THING HOME TO ANYONE AT ANY RATE
PERHAPS TO THE QUESTIONS OF HIS COUNTRY'S DOMESTIC POLICY THE BATTLE GROUND OF HIS CRUSADING VALOUR AGAINST THE PAYNIM CHEESEMAN THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WITHDREW QUIETLY UNNOTICED AS IF ALREADY FORGOTTEN
BUT THAT SENTIMENT WHICH RESEMBLED THE IRRATIONAL HORROR SOME PEOPLE HAVE OF CATS DID NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS IMMENSE CONTEMPT FOR THE ENGLISH POLICE HE FINISHED THE SENTENCE ADDRESSED TO THE GREAT LADY AND TURNED SLIGHTLY IN HIS CHAIR
YES A GENUINE WIFE AND THE VICTIM WAS A GENUINE BROTHER IN LAW FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW WE ARE HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A DOMESTIC DRAMA THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LAUGHED A LITTLE BUT THE GREAT MAN'S THOUGHTS SEEMED TO HAVE WANDERED FAR AWAY
SO THIS INSTRUCTIVE CRIME WAS PLANNED ABROAD MISTER VLADIMIR SAID QUICKLY YOU ADMIT IT WAS PLANNED ABROAD THEORETICALLY THEORETICALLY ONLY ON FOREIGN TERRITORY ABROAD ONLY BY A FICTION SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
BUT IN HIS HEART HE WAS ALMOST AWED BY THE MIRACULOUS CLEVERNESS OF THE ENGLISH POLICE THE CHANGE OF HIS OPINION ON THE SUBJECT WAS SO VIOLENT THAT IT MADE HIM FOR A MOMENT FEEL SLIGHTLY SICK HE THREW AWAY HIS CIGAR AND MOVED ON
AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIS IGNORANCE OF ALL OTHER INDUSTRIAL MATTERS IMMENSE
WHOSE FACE APPEARED TO HIM MORE OMINOUSLY WOODEN THAN EVER BEFORE AND QUITE WONDERFULLY LONG WHAT A QUEER FOREIGN LOOKING CHAP HE IS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SMILING FROM A DISTANCE WITH FRIENDLY BUOYANCY
AT THE NAME OF THAT EXTREMELY EXCLUSIVE CLUB TOODLES LOOKED SCARED AND STOPPED SHORT NONSENSE HE PROTESTED BUT IN AN AWE STRUCK TONE WHAT DO YOU MEAN A MEMBER
FEEL AN IRRESISTIBLE NEED OF CONFESSING OF MAKING A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO SOMEBODY TO ANYBODY AND THEY DO IT OFTEN TO THE POLICE IN THAT VERLOC WHOM HEAT WISHED SO MUCH TO SCREEN I'VE FOUND A MAN IN THAT PARTICULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE
ONLY HE FELT CERTAIN THAT HIS WIFE WOULD NOT EVEN HEAR OF GOING ABROAD NOTHING COULD BE MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RESPECTABLE BOND THAN THAT WENT ON WITH A TOUCH OF GRIMNESS THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WHOSE OWN WIFE TOO HAD REFUSED TO HEAR OF GOING ABROAD
MISTER VLADIMIR ASKED HIMSELF WHAT THAT CONFOUNDED AND INTRUSIVE POLICEMAN WAS DRIVING AT DESCENDED FROM GENERATIONS VICTIMISED BY THE INSTRUMENTS OF AN ARBITRARY POWER HE WAS RACIALLY
YOU SEE THAT WE ARE NOT SO BAD I WANTED PARTICULARLY TO TELL YOU OF OUR SUCCESS I'M SURE I'M VERY GRATEFUL MUTTERED MISTER VLADIMIR THROUGH HIS TEETH
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU EVER MET BEFORE SAID THE GREAT LADY MISTER VLADIMIR AND THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER INTRODUCED ACKNOWLEDGED EACH OTHER'S EXISTENCE WITH PUNCTILIOUS AND GUARDED COURTESY
YES SIR ETHELRED SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER PRESSING DEFERENTIALLY THE EXTENDED HAND A GENUINE WIFE AND A GENUINELY RESPECTABLY MARITAL RELATION HE TOLD ME THAT AFTER HIS INTERVIEW AT THE EMBASSY HE WOULD HAVE THROWN EVERYTHING UP
FINDING THE DRAWING ROOM DARK HE WENT UPSTAIRS AND SPENT SOME TIME BETWEEN THE BEDROOM AND THE DRESSING ROOM CHANGING HIS CLOTHES GOING TO AND FRO WITH THE AIR OF A THOUGHTFUL SOMNAMBULIST
CHAPTER TEN THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DRIVEN RAPIDLY IN A HANSOM FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SOHO IN THE DIRECTION OF WESTMINSTER GOT OUT AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE EMPIRE ON WHICH THE SUN NEVER SETS
IN SOME MANNER OR OTHER HOW LONG WERE YOU WITH HIM INTERRUPTED THE PRESENCE FROM BEHIND HIS BIG HAND SOME FORTY MINUTES SIR ETHELRED IN A HOUSE OF BAD REPUTE CALLED CONTINENTAL HOTEL
YOU DID BUT THE FELLOW WILL DISAPPEAR PARDON ME I DON'T THINK SO WHERE COULD HE GO TO MOREOVER YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT HE HAS GOT TO THINK OF THE DANGER FROM HIS COMRADES TOO HE'S THERE AT HIS POST
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WAS DULY HELPED INTO HIS COAT AND LET OUT AT ONCE AFTER DESCENDING THE FRONT STEPS HE STOPPED AS IF TO CONSIDER THE WAY HE SHOULD TAKE ON SEEING THIS THROUGH THE DOOR HELD OPEN MISTER VLADIMIR LINGERED IN THE HALL TO GET OUT A CIGAR
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THEN IMPARTED BRIEFLY TO THE GREAT MAN WHO SAT STILL RESTING HIS EYES UNDER THE SCREEN OF HIS HAND MISTER VERLOC'S APPRECIATION OF MISTER VLADIMIR'S PROCEEDINGS AND CHARACTER
NO NO DETAILS PLEASE THE GREAT SHADOWY FORM SEEMED TO SHRINK AWAY AS IF IN PHYSICAL DREAD OF DETAILS THEN CAME FORWARD EXPANDED ENORMOUS AND WEIGHTY OFFERING A LARGE HAND AND YOU SAY THAT THIS MAN HAS GOT A WIFE
WHOM HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO LOOK OUT FOR SOME TIME ABOUT MIDNIGHT HIS TURNING UP SO EARLY HE CONCLUDED TO BE THE SIGN THAT THINGS WHATEVER THEY WERE HAD GONE WRONG
THE GREAT MAN MANIFESTED NO SURPRISE NO EAGERNESS NO SENTIMENT WHATEVER THE ATTITUDE IN WHICH HE RESTED HIS MENACED EYES WAS PROFOUNDLY MEDITATIVE HE DID NOT ALTER IT THE LEAST BIT
BUT IN TRUTH THERE IS A SORT OF LUCIDITY PROPER TO EXTRAVAGANT LANGUAGE AND THE GREAT MAN WAS NOT OFFENDED A SLIGHT JERKY MOVEMENT OF THE BIG BODY HALF LOST IN THE GLOOM OF THE GREEN SILK SHADES
THE THING'S BECOMING INDECENT AND DANGEROUS TOO FOR US HERE MISTER VLADIMIR STOPPED AGAIN FOR A MOMENT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ENTERING SAW AT FIRST ONLY A BIG PALE HAND SUPPORTING A BIG HEAD AND CONCEALING THE UPPER PART OF A BIG PALE FACE AN OPEN DESPATCH BOX STOOD ON THE WRITING TABLE NEAR A FEW OBLONG SHEETS OF PAPER
WHO LOOKED TO HIM UNCOMMONLY LIKE A MAN WHO HAS MADE A MESS OF HIS JOB BUT HIS CURIOSITY WAS TOO STRONG TO BE RESTRAINED BY MERE COMPASSION HE COULD NOT HELP
PAR EXCELLENCE IN THE MINDS OF MANY MILLIONS OF MEN HE WAS MET AT LAST BY THE VOLATILE AND REVOLUTIONARY TOODLES THAT NEAT AND NICE YOUNG MAN CONCEALED HIS ASTONISHMENT AT THE EARLY APPEARANCE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
HE LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM HURRIEDLY AND FOUND MISTER VLADIMIR STILL IN THE HALL WRAPPING UP HIS THROAT CAREFULLY IN A LARGE SILK HANDKERCHIEF BEHIND HIM A FOOTMAN WAITED HOLDING HIS OVERCOAT ANOTHER STOOD READY TO OPEN THE DOOR
THE THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND THAT MISTER VLADIMIR HONORARY MEMBER WOULD NOT BE SEEN VERY OFTEN THERE IN THE FUTURE HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH IT WAS ONLY HALF PAST TEN
IT IS RATHER A CURIOUS AFFAIR TOO LONG PERHAPS TO STATE FULLY JUST NOW WHAT THEN HAVE YOU LEARNED ASKED THE GREAT MAN FIRST I'VE LEARNED THAT THE EX CONVICT MICHAELIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
AND THE CONVERSATION DROPPED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS MISTER VLADIMIR TOOK LEAVE DIRECTLY HIS BACK WAS TURNED ON THE COUCH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ROSE TOO
YOU MEAN THAT WE HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE OF THESE PEOPLE YES INDEED WE SUFFER GREATLY FROM THEIR ACTIVITY WHILE YOU MISTER VLADIMIR HESITATED FOR A MOMENT IN SMILING PERPLEXITY WHILE YOU SUFFER THEIR PRESENCE GLADLY IN YOUR MIDST
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER GAVE HIM AN UNSMILING GLANCE TILL THEY CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE GREAT MAN'S ROOM TOODLES PRESERVED A SCANDALISED AND SOLEMN SILENCE
WHICH UPON THE WHOLE HE BELIEVED TO BE A NICE PLACE TO LIVE ON HE STOOD ASIDE GO IN WITHOUT KNOCKING HE SAID
HE BECAME ANGRY AND FRIGHTENED UPON MY WORD MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE THOUGHT THESE EMBASSY PEOPLE QUITE CAPABLE
THE WEALTH AND PRECISION OF DETAIL WILL CARRY CONVICTION TO THE GREAT MASS OF THE PUBLIC ADVANCED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER GENTLY
AND TOOK AWAY THE LAD ON THE PRETENCE OF GOING OUT FOR A WALK IN THE LANES AS IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT HE DID THIS MICHAELIS COULD NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL FOR THE REST SIR ETHELRED
AND YOUR SPRAT GOT HIM ANSWERED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WITH A CONCISION WHICH DID NOT MEAN TO BE REPELLENT IN THE LEAST GOOD YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW THESE GREAT MEN DISLIKE TO BE DISAPPOINTED IN SMALL THINGS
AS THOUGH HE WERE QUOTING CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ALL THAT'S WANTED NOW IS TO DO AWAY WITH THE AGENT PROVOCATEUR TO MAKE EVERYTHING SAFE MISTER VLADIMIR HELD UP HIS HAND TO A PASSING HANSOM
NOTWITHSTANDING THE KINDNESS OF HIS DISPOSITION THE YOUNG PRIVATE SECRETARY UNPAID WAS ACCESSIBLE TO THE COMMON FAILINGS OF HUMANITY HE DID NOT WISH TO HARROW THE FEELINGS OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
HE HAD HIS OWN CRUSADING INSTINCTS THIS AFFAIR WHICH IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER DISGUSTED CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT SEEMED TO HIM A PROVIDENTIALLY GIVEN STARTING POINT FOR A CRUSADE HE HAD IT MUCH AT HEART TO BEGIN
WITH OLD STOTT WARTENHEIM HIMSELF AND HAD COME TO REGARD HIS SERVICES AS INDISPENSABLE IT WAS AN EXTREMELY RUDE AWAKENING
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HE DID NOT PLAN THE DEATH OF THAT WRETCHED LAD HIS BROTHER IN LAW THAT WAS A SHOCK TO HIM I COULD SEE THAT PERHAPS HE IS A MAN OF STRONG SENSIBILITIES PERHAPS HE WAS EVEN FOND OF THE LAD WHO KNOWS
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MAY BE DONE WITH A SPRAT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ASKED IN HIS TURN HE'S SOMETIMES PUT INTO A SARDINE BOX CHUCKLED TOODLES WHOSE ERUDITION ON THE SUBJECT OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY WAS FRESH
THE GREAT PRESENCE MADE A SLIGHT MOVEMENT YOU MUST BE LUCID PLEASE YES SIR ETHELRED
AMENDED THE LADY FORCE OF HABIT PERHAPS SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER MOVED BY AN IRRESISTIBLE INSPIRATION HE HAS BEEN THREATENING SOCIETY WITH ALL SORTS OF HORRORS CONTINUED THE LADY
AT THE END OF THE FOURTH STRIDE MISTER VLADIMIR FELT INFURIATED AND UNEASY THIS COULD NOT LAST ROTTEN WEATHER HE GROWLED SAVAGELY MILD SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WITHOUT PASSION
BUT MISTER VLADIMIR SITTING STONY EYED INSIDE THE HANSOM DROVE OFF WITHOUT A WORD THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER HIMSELF DID NOT TURN INTO THE NOBLE BUILDING IT WAS THE EXPLORERS CLUB
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A SCANDAL FOR FROM MORALITY OR WHAT MISTER VLADIMIR'S ANXIETY WAS OBVIOUS THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER HAVING ASCERTAINED IN THIS WAY THAT THERE MUST BE SOME TRUTH IN THE SUMMARY STATEMENTS OF MISTER VERLOC
HE SAW NONE A COUPLE OF CARRIAGES WAITED BY THE CURBSTONE THEIR LAMPS BLAZING STEADILY THE HORSES STANDING PERFECTLY STILL AS IF CARVED IN STONE
THE PROSECUTION OF THIS VERLOC WILL DEMONSTRATE TO THE PUBLIC BOTH THE DANGER AND THE INDECENCY NOBODY WILL BELIEVE WHAT A MAN OF THAT SORT SAYS SAID MISTER VLADIMIR CONTEMPTUOUSLY
ONE MET EVERYBODY SOONER OR LATER MISTER VLADIMIR'S ROSY COUNTENANCE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES BECAUSE HE WAS WITTY BUT HIS EYES REMAINED SERIOUS LIKE THE EYES OF CONVINCED MAN WELL HE TRIED TO AT LEAST
SHADES OF GREEN SILK FITTED LOW OVER ALL THE LIGHTS IMPARTED TO THE ROOM SOMETHING OF A FOREST'S DEEP GLOOM THE HAUGHTY EYES WERE PHYSICALLY THE GREAT MAN'S WEAK POINT THIS POINT WAS WRAPPED UP IN SECRECY
OF THE BIG HEAD LEANING ON THE BIG HAND ACCOMPANIED AN INTERMITTENT STIFLED BUT POWERFUL SOUND THE GREAT MAN HAD LAUGHED WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ANSWERED VERY READILY
BUT HE SHOOK IT OFF BEFORE GOING OUT AGAIN TO JOIN HIS WIFE AT THE HOUSE OF THE GREAT LADY PATRONESS OF MICHAELIS HE KNEW HE WOULD BE WELCOMED THERE ON ENTERING THE SMALLER OF THE TWO DRAWING ROOMS HE SAW HIS WIFE IN A SMALL GROUP NEAR THE PIANO
I'LL SEE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO NIGHT AND WILL SEND FOR YOU TO MORROW MORNING IS THERE ANYTHING MORE YOU'D WISH TO TELL ME NOW THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER HAD STOOD UP ALSO SLENDER AND FLEXIBLE I THINK NOT SIR ETHELRED UNLESS I WERE TO ENTER INTO DETAILS WHICH
WITHOUT AS MUCH AS A QUIVER STIRRING THE WHITE THONGS OF THEIR BIG WHIPS MISTER VLADIMIR WALKED ON AND THE CONFOUNDED POLICEMAN FELL INTO STEP AT HIS ELBOW HE SAID NOTHING
THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS CANNOT COMPLAIN OF THE INEFFICIENCY OF OUR POLICE LOOK AT THIS OUTRAGE
CLOSETED IN A ROOM WHICH BY THE BY I TOOK FOR THE NIGHT I FOUND HIM UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT REACTION WHICH FOLLOWS THE EFFORT OF CRIME THE MAN CANNOT BE DEFINED AS A HARDENED CRIMINAL
SOME STALWART CONSTABLES WHO DID NOT SEEM PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED BY THE DUTY OF WATCHING THE AUGUST SPOT SALUTED HIM PENETRATING THROUGH A PORTAL BY NO MEANS LOFTY INTO THE PRECINCTS OF THE HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE
AS THOUGH HE WERE OFFENDED WITH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER FOR EXPOSING SUCH AN UNSAVOURY AND DISTURBING FACT IT REVOLUTIONISED HIS IDEA OF THE EXPLORERS CLUB'S EXTREME SELECTNESS OF ITS SOCIAL PURITY TOODLES WAS REVOLUTIONARY ONLY IN POLITICS
THOUGH INDEED THE LAD HAD BEEN LIVING WITH HIM TEMPORARILY IN THE COUNTRY UP TO EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT MICHAELIS KNOWS NOTHING OF IT TO THIS MOMENT YOU ARE POSITIVE AS TO THAT ASKED THE GREAT MAN QUITE CERTAIN SIR ETHELRED
IT'S A WITTY FISH I HAVE SEEN HIM SAID TOODLES INCREDULOUSLY I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHERE I COULD HAVE SEEN HIM AT THE EXPLORERS I SHOULD SAY DROPPED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CALMLY
WHAT PLEASED ME MOST IN THIS AFFAIR THE ASSISTANT WENT ON TALKING SLOWLY
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO A COURSE OF ACTION ON WHICH I WISHED TO KNOW YOUR PRECISE INTENTIONS FIRST THE GREAT PERSONAGE ROSE HEAVILY AN IMPOSING SHADOWY FORM IN THE GREENISH GLOOM OF THE ROOM
I MEAN GOVERNMENTS AND MEN YES SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SIMPLY ONLY YOU LOOK AT EUROPE FROM ITS OTHER END
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO STAY AND TAKE ANNIE HOME SAID THE LADY PATRONESS OF MICHAELIS I FIND THAT I'VE YET A LITTLE WORK TO DO TO NIGHT IN CONNECTION
SHE EXTENDED HER HAND TO THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER I NEVER HOPED TO SEE YOU HERE TO NIGHT ANNIE TOLD ME YES I HAD NO IDEA MYSELF THAT MY WORK WOULD BE OVER SO SOON
AND ASKED FOR A LIGHT IT WAS FURNISHED TO HIM BY AN ELDERLY MAN OUT OF LIVERY WITH AN AIR OF CALM SOLICITUDE BUT THE MATCH WENT OUT THE FOOTMAN THEN CLOSED THE DOOR AND MISTER VLADIMIR LIGHTED HIS LARGE HAVANA WITH LEISURELY CARE
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER INVITED TO TAKE A CHAIR SAT DOWN IN THE DIM LIGHT THE SALIENT POINTS OF HIS PERSONALITY THE LONG FACE THE BLACK HAIR HIS LANKNESS MADE HIM LOOK MORE FOREIGN THAN EVER
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER KNEW THE LADY YOU DO NOT LOOK FRIGHTENED HE PRONOUNCED AFTER SURVEYING HER CONSCIENTIOUSLY WITH HIS TIRED AND EQUABLE GAZE HE WAS THINKING MEANTIME TO HIMSELF THAT IN THIS HOUSE
HE'S BEEN FRIGHTENING ME DECLARED SUDDENLY THE LADY WHO SAT BY THE SIDE OF MISTER VLADIMIR
HE TOODLES HOPED HE WOULD BORE THEM INTO A COUNT OUT EVERY MINUTE
BUT OUR MAN TOOK IT SERIOUSLY IT APPEARS HE FELT HIMSELF THREATENED
TO TWO THICK MEN WHOSE BACKS LOOKED OLD AND THREE SLENDER WOMEN WHOSE BACKS LOOKED YOUNG BEHIND THE SCREEN THE GREAT LADY HAD ONLY TWO PERSONS WITH HER A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO SAT SIDE BY SIDE ON ARM CHAIRS AT THE FOOT OF HER COUCH
WHOSE ENUNCIATION WAS CARESSING AND SLOW APROPOS OF THIS EXPLOSION IN GREENWICH PARK IT APPEARS WE ALL OUGHT TO QUAKE IN OUR SHOES AT WHAT'S COMING IF THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT SUPPRESSED ALL OVER THE WORLD I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS SUCH A GRAVE AFFAIR
THE PATRONESS OF THE EX CONVICT RECEIVED THIS ASSURANCE INDIGNANTLY WHY WERE YOUR PEOPLE STUPID ENOUGH TO CONNECT HIM WITH NOT STUPID INTERRUPTED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CONTRADICTING DEFERENTIALLY
SAID INDIFFERENTLY THERE'S A PRACTICAL SIDE TOO WE HAVE REALLY ENOUGH TO DO TO LOOK AFTER THE GENUINE ARTICLE YOU CAN'T SAY WE ARE NOT EFFECTIVE
IN MY OPINION THEY ARE A GHASTLY NUISANCE ALSO AN ELEMENT OF DANGER BUT WE CAN'T VERY WELL SEEK THEM OUT INDIVIDUALLY THE ONLY WAY IS TO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYMENT UNPLEASANT TO THEIR EMPLOYERS
WHO PUT YOU UP TO IT AND WHO WAS THE MAN WHO DID IT HE ANSWERED THE FIRST WITH REMARKABLE EMPHASIS AS TO THE SECOND QUESTION I GATHER THAT THE FELLOW WITH THE BOMB WAS HIS BROTHER IN LAW QUITE A LAD A WEAK MINDED CREATURE
NOT EXACTLY WHAT I AM AFTER IS MORE LIKE A DOG FISH YOU DON'T KNOW PERHAPS WHAT A DOG FISH IS LIKE YES I DO WE'RE BURIED IN SPECIAL BOOKS UP TO OUR NECKS WHOLE SHELVES FULL OF THEM WITH PLATES
WE'VE GOT THE MAN WE HAVE NO CHOICE
ANYWAY THE CHIEF COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO GO HOME HE WILL SEE YOU AT ONCE I THINK HE'S SITTING ALL ALONE IN HIS ROOM THINKING OF ALL THE FISHES OF THE SEA CONCLUDED TOODLES AIRILY COME ALONG
WHO WAS GOOD AND OF HIS TRULY PECULIAR DUMBNESS WHICH IN THE OLD AFFAIR OF FIREWORKS ON THE STAIRS HAD FOR MANY YEARS RESISTED ENTREATIES COAXING ANGER AND OTHER MEANS OF INVESTIGATION USED BY HIS BELOVED SISTER
BUT HIS TONE WAS NOT DREAMY WELL WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'VE FOUND OUT ALREADY YOU CAME UPON SOMETHING UNEXPECTED ON THE FIRST STEP NOT EXACTLY UNEXPECTED SIR ETHELRED WHAT I MAINLY CAME UPON WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE
IT MUST HAVE SEEMED MIRACULOUS TO HIM THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ALREADY BUT HE TOOK IT ALL IN THE STRIDE THE WONDERFULNESS OF IT NEVER CHECKED HIM FOR A MOMENT
THE MAN FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING FLUNG HIMSELF ON MY BREAST IT WAS ENOUGH ON MY PART TO WHISPER TO HIM WHO I WAS AND TO ADD I KNOW THAT YOU ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS AFFAIR
HE FINISHED DISPLAYING A DIMPLE ON EACH CLEAN SHAVEN CHEEK THEN HE ADDED MORE GRAVELY I MAY EVEN SAY BECAUSE YOU DO WHEN MISTER VLADIMIR CEASED SPEAKING THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LOWERED HIS GLANCE
AFTER THIS PROFOUND OBSERVATION THE EXPERIENCED TOODLES SEEMED TO REFLECT AT ANY RATE HE SAID NOTHING FOR QUITE TWO SECONDS THEN I'M GLAD
BUT HE COULD NOT PREVENT HIMSELF FROM EXCLAIMING WHAT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DID NOT REPEAT HIS STATEMENT YOU KNOW HIM HE WENT ON IN THE SAME TONE MISTER VLADIMIR STOPPED AND BECAME GUTTURAL
HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A LITTLE WHILE WE'VE GOT HOLD OF A MAN CALLED VERLOC HE ANNOUNCED CASUALLY
MISTER VLADIMIR'S TONE BECAME LOFTY FOR MY PART I CAN'T SHARE YOUR VIEW IT IS SELFISH MY SENTIMENTS FOR MY OWN COUNTRY CANNOT BE DOUBTED BUT I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT WE OUGHT TO BE GOOD EUROPEANS BESIDES
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER INTERRUPTED THE APPRENTICE STATESMAN YES YES BUT A SPRAT IS ALSO THROWN AWAY SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO CATCH A WHALE A WHALE PHEW EXCLAIMED TOODLES WITH BATED BREATH YOU'RE AFTER A WHALE THEN
NATIONALLY AND INDIVIDUALLY AFRAID OF THE POLICE IT WAS AN INHERITED WEAKNESS ALTOGETHER INDEPENDENT OF HIS JUDGMENT OF HIS REASON OF HIS EXPERIENCE HE WAS BORN TO IT
HE WALKED SLOWLY HOME MEDITATING THAT ENTERPRISE ON THE WAY AND THINKING OVER MISTER VERLOC'S PSYCHOLOGY IN A COMPOSITE MOOD OF REPUGNANCE AND SATISFACTION HE WALKED ALL THE WAY HOME
YOU'RE NOT GOING IN HERE REMARKED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER LOOKING AT A BUILDING OF NOBLE PROPORTIONS AND HOSPITABLE ASPECT WITH THE LIGHT OF A GREAT HALL FALLING THROUGH ITS GLASS DOORS ON A BROAD FLIGHT OF STEPS
WITH AN EXTREMELY READY SYMPATHY WHICH IN NICE YOUNGSTERS GOES OFTEN WITH A JOYOUS TEMPERAMENT HE FELT SORRY FOR THE GREAT PRESENCE HE CALLED THE CHIEF AND ALSO FOR THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER DID NOT SEEM TO REFUSE IT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COMPETENCY BUT THE GREAT PERSONAGE REMARKED ALL THIS SEEMS VERY FANTASTIC DOESN'T IT ONE WOULD THINK A FEROCIOUS JOKE
THE INDIGNATION OF THIS MAN VERLOC HAD LEFT NOTHING IN DOUBT NOTHING WHATEVER HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF HIS MIND ALMOST BY AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE
AND A SCATTERED HANDFUL OF QUILL PENS THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE ON THE LARGE FLAT SURFACE EXCEPT A LITTLE BRONZE STATUETTE DRAPED IN A TOGA MYSTERIOUSLY WATCHFUL IN ITS SHADOWY IMMOBILITY
HONORARY MUTTERED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THROUGH HIS TEETH HEAVENS TOODLES LOOKED SO THUNDERSTRUCK THAT THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SMILED FAINTLY THAT'S BETWEEN OURSELVES STRICTLY HE SAID
MISTER VLADIMIR AFFECTING NOT TO LISTEN LEANED TOWARDS THE COUCH TALKING AMIABLY IN SUBDUED TONES BUT HE HEARD THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER SAY I'VE NO DOUBT THAT MISTER VLADIMIR HAS A VERY PRECISE NOTION OF THE TRUE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AFFAIR
HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN LEAVING IT BUT EVEN IF THERE WERE NO OBSTACLES TO HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION HE WOULD DO NOTHING AT PRESENT HE HASN'T ENOUGH MORAL ENERGY TO TAKE A RESOLUTION OF ANY SORT PERMIT ME ALSO TO POINT OUT THAT IF I HAD DETAINED HIM
IT LOOKED AS IF THE GREAT ASSAULT THREATENED FOR THAT NIGHT WERE GOING TO FIZZLE OUT AN INFERIOR HENCHMAN OF THAT BRUTE CHEESEMAN WAS UP BORING MERCILESSLY A VERY THIN HOUSE WITH SOME SHAMELESSLY COOKED STATISTICS
IN LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE IDENTITY OF A MAN LITERALLY BLOWN TO SHREDS HAVE FOUND THE ORGANISER OF THE ATTEMPT AND HAVE HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE INCITER BEHIND HIM
WELL YES IN A WAY TELL ME WHAT IS IT REALLY THIS HORROR IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT IT IS BUT IT MAY YET BE A CAUSE CELEBRE SAID THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
CLEVER ENOUGH QUITE CLEVER ENOUGH FOR THAT A SILENCE FELL THE MAN AT THE FOOT OF THE COUCH HAD STOPPED SPEAKING TO THE LADY AND LOOKED ON WITH A FAINT SMILE
IT'S A NOXIOUS RASCALLY LOOKING ALTOGETHER DETESTABLE BEAST WITH A SORT OF SMOOTH FACE AND MOUSTACHES DESCRIBED TO A T COMMENDED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ONLY MINE IS CLEAN SHAVEN ALTOGETHER YOU'VE SEEN HIM
WHEN AT LAST HE GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE HE SAW WITH DISGUST THE CONFOUNDED POLICEMAN STILL STANDING ON THE PAVEMENT CAN HE BE WAITING FOR ME THOUGHT MISTER VLADIMIR LOOKING UP AND DOWN FOR SOME SIGNS OF A HANSOM
OBLIGES THEM TO ADOPT THESE OPINIONS MOST OF THE CATHOLICS ARE POOR AND THEY HAVE NO CHANCE OF TAKING A PART IN THE GOVERNMENT UNLESS IT BE OPEN TO ALL THE CITIZENS THEY CONSTITUTE A MINORITY
RETAINS A GREATER INFLUENCE OVER THE SOULS OF MEN THAN IN AMERICA AND THERE CAN BE NO GREATER PROOF OF ITS UTILITY AND OF ITS CONFORMITY TO HUMAN NATURE THAN THAT ITS INFLUENCE IS MOST POWERFULLY FELT OVER THE MOST ENLIGHTENED
WHEN THEY RETURN FROM THEIR EXPEDITION WE SHALL HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE PERSONS IN FRANCE WHO LOOK UPON REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS AS A TEMPORARY MEANS OF POWER OF WEALTH AND DISTINCTION MEN WHO ARE THE CONDOTTIERI OF LIBERTY
INFLUENCE OF MANNERS UPON THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES I HAVE PREVIOUSLY REMARKED THAT THE MANNERS OF THE PEOPLE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE GENERAL
SO AS TO AVOID ANY QUESTIONINGS FROM PERSONS THEY MIGHT MEET AS TO WHERE THEY HAD COME FROM
HIS JOYS ARE INNOCENT AND CALM AND AS HE FINDS THAT AN ORDERLY LIFE IS THE SUREST PATH TO HAPPINESS HE ACCUSTOMS HIMSELF WITHOUT DIFFICULTY TO MODERATE HIS OPINIONS AS WELL AS HIS TASTES
WELL WE LAUGHED WHEN WE SAW THE THREE PARTIES OF WHITE WOLVES RIDE OUT FROM SAINT DENIS BUT I TELL YOU THERE WAS NO LAUGHING WHEN THEY GOT AMONG US WE WERE IN THE CONSTABLE'S TROOP AND THOUGH AS FAR AS I KNOW WE WERE ALL PRETTY STOUT MEN AT ARMS AND WERE FOUR TO ONE AGAINST THEM AT LEAST
THE FACT THAT YOU MADE FOR SHORE TO LAND PASSENGERS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT THOSE PASSENGERS WERE OF SOME IMPORTANCE NOW GOOD LUCK TO YOU MASTER PHILIP I TRUST TO SEE YOU BACK HERE AGAIN BEFORE LONG THEY KEPT STRAIGHT OUT FROM LA ROCHELLE TO THE ISLE OF OLERON
WHO IS STARTING IN THE MORNING AND HAS CHARTERED A BOAT TO CARRY HIS PRODUCE IF I SAY A WORD TO HIM I HAVE NO DOUBT HE WOULD GIVE THE FOUR OF YOU A PASSAGE FOR A CROWN
THEY PASSED THROUGH THE GATES HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THEY WERE CLOSED AND ENTERED A SMALL CABARET HERE CALLING FOR SOME BREAD AND COMMON WINE THEY SAT DOWN IN A CORNER AND LISTENED TO THE TALK OF THE MEN WHO WERE DRINKING THERE IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE MOVEMENTS OF TROOPS AND THE SCRAPS OF NEWS THAT HAD COME IN FROM ALL QUARTERS
LET NOT TYRANNY MAR THY WORK AND ESTABLISH INEQUALITY UPON THE EARTH ALMIGHTY GOD DO THOU WATCH OVER THE DESTINY OF THE POLES AND RENDER THEM WORTHY TO BE FREE MAY THY WISDOM DIRECT THEIR COUNCILS
LEST BOATS COMING OUT FROM THE CHARENTE MIGHT OVERHAUL THEM FROM THE SOUTHERN END OF THE ISLAND IT WAS ONLY A RUN OF SOME EIGHT MILES INTO THE MOUTH OF THE SEUDRE A BRISK WIND HAD BLOWN AND THEY MADE THE FORTY MILES VOYAGE IN SEVEN HOURS THEY COULD SEE SEVERAL WHITE SAILS FAR TO THE SOUTH AS THEY RAN IN
WITH SOME FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED MEN WHO JOINED THEM ON THE WAY AN EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE BROKE FROM HIS HEARERS THEN WE SHALL HAVE TROUBLE ONE EXCLAIMED LA ROCHELLE IS A HARD NUT TO CRACK IN ITSELF
POLITICAL OPINION WHICH IS CONNECTED WITH IT BY AFFINITY IF THE HUMAN MIND BE LEFT TO FOLLOW ITS OWN BENT IT WILL REGULATE THE TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL INSTITUTIONS OF SOCIETY UPON ONE UNIFORM PRINCIPLE AND MAN WILL ENDEAVOR IF I MAY USE THE EXPRESSION
THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE HAS NO TROOPS
THE PRINCIPAL AIM OF THIS BOOK HAS BEEN TO MAKE KNOWN THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES IF THIS PURPOSE HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE READER IS ALREADY ENABLED TO JUDGE FOR HIMSELF WHICH ARE THE LAWS THAT REALLY TEND TO MAINTAIN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
AND WHICH ENDANGER ITS EXISTENCE IF I HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN EXPLAINING THIS IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY WORK I CANNOT HOPE TO DO SO WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A SINGLE CHAPTER IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO RETRACE THE PATH I HAVE ALREADY PURSUED
WHILST HE SPOKE IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS ALMIGHTY GOD THE GOD OF ARMIES THOU WHO DIDST STRENGTHEN THE HEARTS AND GUIDE THE ARMS OF OUR FATHERS WHEN THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED RIGHTS OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE
SOCIETY HAS NO FUTURE LIFE TO HOPE FOR OR TO FEAR AND PROVIDED THE CITIZENS PROFESS A RELIGION THE PECULIAR TENETS OF THAT RELIGION ARE OF VERY LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO ITS INTERESTS MOREOVER
TWO OF THEM WORE STEEL CAPS AND HAD THE APPEARANCE OF DISCHARGED SOLDIERS THE OTHER TWO LOOKED LIKE FRESH COUNTRYMEN AND WORE THE LOW CAPS IN USE BY THE PEASANTRY ON THEIR HEADS CARRYING STEEL CAPS SLUNG BY CORDS FROM THEIR SHOULDER
AND FREE NATION OF THE EARTH I HAVE REMARKED THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN CLERGY IN GENERAL WITHOUT EVEN EXCEPTING THOSE WHO DO NOT ADMIT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ARE ALL IN FAVOR OF CIVIL FREEDOM BUT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT ANY PARTICULAR POLITICAL SYSTEM
AND WOMEN ARE THE PROTECTORS OF MORALS
CATHOLICISM IS LIKE AN ABSOLUTE MONARCHY IF THE SOVEREIGN BE REMOVED ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF SOCIETY ARE MORE EQUAL THAN THEY ARE IN REPUBLICS
AND THE HUMAN INTELLECT FLOWS ONWARDS IN ONE SOLE CURRENT I HAPPENED TO BE STAYING IN ONE OF THE LARGEST TOWNS IN THE UNION WHEN I WAS INVITED TO ATTEND A PUBLIC MEETING WHICH HAD BEEN CALLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSISTING THE POLES AND OF SENDING THEM SUPPLIES OF ARMS AND MONEY
I COMPRISE THEREFORE UNDER THIS TERM THE WHOLE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF A PEOPLE MY INTENTION IS NOT TO DRAW A PICTURE OF AMERICAN MANNERS BUT SIMPLY TO POINT OUT SUCH FEATURES OF THEM
WHICH RETARD AND STOP THEIR COMPLETION THE IMAGINATION OF THE AMERICANS EVEN IN ITS GREATEST FLIGHTS IS CIRCUMSPECT AND UNDECIDED ITS IMPULSES ARE CHECKED AND ITS WORKS UNFINISHED
IT WOULD SAVE US SOME THIRTY OR FORTY MILES WALKING AND PERHAPS SOME EXPENSE FOR FERRYS TO SAY NOUGHT OF TROUBLE WITH THE TROOPS WHO ARE APT ENOUGH MOREOVER TO SEARCH THE POCKETS OF THOSE WHO PASS I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLAN HIS BROTHER REPLIED
BE NOT CONSUMMATED IN OUR TIME O LORD WHO HOLDEST ALIKE THE HEARTS OF NATIONS AND OF MEN IN THY POWERFUL HAND RAISE UP ALLIES TO THE SACRED CAUSE OF RIGHT AROUSE THE FRENCH NATION FROM THE APATHY IN WHICH ITS RULERS RETAIN IT
AND IF NOT WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHOM YOU HAD LANDED AND OTHER MATTERS I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THE CRAFT WHICH HAS DONE ME GOOD SERVICE IN HER TIME AND IS A HANDY LITTLE COASTER BUT I WOULD RATHER LOSE IT THAN THAT YOU SHOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE BORDEAUX BOATS AND GET INTO TROUBLE
THE REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS WHICH NOW FLOURISH UPON THE SHORES OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN WOULD BE IN GREAT PERIL IT IS THEREFORE OUR INTEREST THAT THE NEW STATES SHOULD BE RELIGIOUS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR LIBERTIES
THE FREQUENTERS OF THE CABARET PRESENTLY DROPPED OFF
AH WELL WE SHALL DO BETTER THIS TIME THE FIRST SPEAKER SAID WE ARE BETTER PREPARED THAN WE WERE THEN AND EXCEPT LA ROCHELLE AND FOUR OR FIVE SMALL TOWNS EVERY PLACE IN FRANCE IS IN OUR HANDS
AND IF SO THEY WILL BE MOVING IN ALL DIRECTIONS TO JOIN HIM THERE
BUT THE REVOLUTIONISTS OF AMERICA ARE OBLIGED TO PROFESS AN OSTENSIBLE RESPECT FOR CHRISTIAN MORALITY AND EQUITY WHICH DOES NOT EASILY PERMIT THEM TO VIOLATE THE LAWS THAT OPPOSE THEIR DESIGNS
WHEN EVERY BRIDGE AND FORD ACROSS THE RIVERS IS WATCHED BY ARMED MEN AND ALL WHO PASS ARE QUESTIONED SHARPLY AS TO THEIR BUSINESS WELL IF THEY WON'T LET US PASS
WITH WHICH THEY SEEK FOR FORTUNE IF THE MIND OF THE AMERICANS WERE FREE FROM ALL TRAMMELS THEY WOULD VERY SHORTLY BECOME THE MOST DARING INNOVATORS AND THE MOST IMPLACABLE DISPUTANTS IN THE WORLD
AND TWO OR THREE FLASKS OF GOOD WINE
THAN WHEN IT SAYS NOTHING OF FREEDOM
FOR MY COMRADE HERE AND I SERVED UNDER DE BRISSAC IN ITALY WE WOULD RATHER ENLIST UNDER OUR OWN LORD THAN UNDER A STRANGER YES THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND THE LANDLORD SAID
CAUSES TO WHICH THE MAINTENANCE OF A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES IS ATTRIBUTABLE I HERE USED THE WORD MANNERS WITH THE MEANING WHICH THE ANCIENTS ATTACHED TO THE WORD MORES
TO SHELTER ALL THE TYRANTS OF FUTURE AGES THUS WHILST THE LAW PERMITS THE AMERICANS TO DO WHAT THEY PLEASE RELIGION PREVENTS THEM FROM CONCEIVING AND FORBIDS THEM TO COMMIT WHAT IS RASH OR UNJUST
IN THE UNITED STATES THE INFLUENCE OF RELIGION IS NOT CONFINED TO THE MANNERS BUT IT EXTENDS TO THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE PEOPLE AMONGST THE ANGLO AMERICANS THERE ARE SOME WHO PROFESS THE DOCTRINES OF CHRISTIANITY
YOUR BEST PLAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE GONE BY BOAT TO BORDEAUX
THREE PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS JUDICIAL POWER
THEY ARE FERVENT AND ZEALOUS IN THE SUPPORT AND BELIEF OF THEIR DOCTRINES NEVERTHELESS THEY CONSTITUTE THE MOST REPUBLICAN AND THE MOST DEMOCRATIC CLASS OF CITIZENS
IT MUST BE OWNED ANOTHER OF THE GROUP SAID THAT THESE WOLVES BITE HARD
IT FACILITATES THE USE OF FREE INSTITUTIONS INDEED IT IS IN THIS SAME POINT OF VIEW THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THE UNITED STATES THEMSELVES LOOK UPON RELIGIOUS BELIEF I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER ALL THE AMERICANS HAVE A SINCERE FAITH IN THEIR RELIGION
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN PRINCIPAL CAUSES MAINTAINING THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC PART TWO INFLUENCE OF THE LAWS UPON THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES
HAVING HUNG UP A LANTERN HAD LEFT THEM ALONE HALF OUR DIFFICULTIES WILL BE OVER WHEN WE GET TO BORDEAUX
SUCH ARE THE OPINIONS OF THE AMERICANS AND IF ANY HOLD THAT THE RELIGIOUS SPIRIT WHICH I ADMIRE IS THE VERY THING MOST AMISS IN AMERICA
TOWARDS WHICH MODERN SOCIETY IS DAILY IMPELLED BY THE IDEAS AND MANNERS OF THE TIME AND WHO SINCERELY DESIRE TO PREPARE MEN TO BE FREE WHEN THESE MEN ATTACK RELIGIOUS OPINIONS THEY OBEY THE DICTATES OF THEIR PASSIONS
NOR WOULD THEY FIND IT EASY TO SURMOUNT THE SCRUPLES OF THEIR PARTISANS EVEN IF THEY WERE ABLE TO GET OVER THEIR OWN HITHERTO NO ONE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS DARED TO ADVANCE THE MAXIM THAT EVERYTHING IS PERMISSIBLE WITH A VIEW TO THE INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
WHILST THE EUROPEAN ENDEAVORS TO FORGET HIS DOMESTIC TROUBLES BY AGITATING SOCIETY THE AMERICAN DERIVES FROM HIS OWN HOME THAT LOVE OF ORDER WHICH HE AFTERWARDS CARRIES WITH HIM INTO PUBLIC AFFAIRS
IT HAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY OCCURRED THAT THE CATHOLIC PRIEST HAS LEFT THE SERVICE OF THE ALTAR TO MIX WITH THE GOVERNING POWERS OF SOCIETY AND TO TAKE HIS PLACE AMONGST THE CIVIL GRADATIONS OF MEN
THEY SAY THEY HADN'T FIFTY MEN WITH THEM IT SEEMS TO ME THEY ARE MAKING A GREAT FUSS ABOUT NOTHING I HAVE JUST HEARD A REPORT A MAN WHO HAD TWO OR THREE MINUTES BEFORE ENTERED THE ROOM SAID TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY ARRIVED FOUR DAYS SINCE AT LA ROCHELLE
ATE A HEARTY MEAL AND THEN LAY DOWN TO SLEEP THEY WERE AFOOT AGAIN AT DAYLIGHT THE COUNTRY WAS SPARSELY POPULATED THEY PASSED THROUGH A FEW SMALL VILLAGES BUT NO PLACE OF ANY IMPORTANCE UNTIL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THEY APPROACHED BLAYE AFTER A LONG DAY'S TRAMP
IT SUBJECTS THE WISE AND IGNORANT THE MAN OF GENIUS AND THE VULGAR CROWD TO THE DETAILS OF THE SAME CREED IT IMPOSES THE SAME OBSERVANCES UPON THE RICH AND NEEDY IT INFLICTS THE SAME AUSTERITIES UPON THE STRONG AND THE WEAK
BUT ALL THE SECTS PREACH THE SAME MORAL LAW IN THE NAME OF GOD IF IT BE OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE TO MAN AS AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HIS RELIGION SHOULD BE TRUE THE CASE OF SOCIETY IS NOT THE SAME
THE PRIEST AND THE PEOPLE THE PRIEST ALONE RISES ABOVE THE RANK OF HIS FLOCK AND ALL BELOW HIM ARE EQUAL ON DOCTRINAL POINTS THE CATHOLIC FAITH PLACES ALL HUMAN CAPACITIES UPON THE SAME LEVEL
AND FIND THAT THEY ARE TOO FAST FOR YOU PUT THEM ASHORE WHEREVER THEY MAY DIRECT IF YOU ARE TOO HOTLY CHASED TO ESCAPE AFTER LANDING THEM YOU HAD BEST ALSO DISEMBARK AND MAKE YOUR WAY BACK BY LAND AS BEST YOU CAN LEAVING THEM TO DO WHAT THEY WILL WITH THE BOAT AS LIKE AS NOT THEY WOULD CUT YOUR THROATS DID THEY TAKE YOU
AND WE THANK YOU FOR HAVING PUT US IN THE WAY OF SAVING OUR LEGS TOMORROW WHAT TIME DO YOU THINK YOUR COUSIN WILL BE IN HE WILL HAVE HIS CARTS AT THE GATES BY THE TIME THEY OPEN THEM HE IS NOT ONE TO WASTE TIME BESIDES EVERY MINUTE IS OF IMPORTANCE
IF THEN THE CATHOLIC CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE NOT FORCIBLY LED BY THE NATURE OF THEIR TENETS TO ADOPT DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES AT LEAST THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO THEM
AND MAY GIVE A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE AFTER ALL WHAT CAN THE CATHOLIC LORDS HAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT THEY MANAGED TO LET THEM SLIP THROUGH THEIR HANDS IN THAT WAY THEY MUST HAVE SEEN FOR SOME TIME THAT THEY WERE MAKING FOR THE ONE PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD BE SAFE UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE MAKING DOWN FOR NAVARRE
ARRIVAL OF THE CATHOLICS FOR WHAT REASON THE CATHOLICS FORM THE MOST DEMOCRATIC AND THE MOST REPUBLICAN CLASS AT THE PRESENT TIME EVERY RELIGION IS TO BE FOUND IN JUXTAPOSITION TO A
WHICH SEEMS TO VEGETATE IN THE SOUL RATHER THAN TO LIVE I HAVE KNOWN OF SOCIETIES FORMED BY THE AMERICANS TO SEND OUT MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL INTO THE NEW WESTERN STATES
PITIFULLY LOOK DOWN UPON THAT HEROIC NATION WHICH IS EVEN NOW STRUGGLING AS WE DID IN THE FORMER TIME AND FOR THE SAME RIGHTS WHICH WE DEFENDED WITH OUR BLOOD THOU WHO DIDST CREATE MAN IN THE LIKENESS OF THE SAME IMAGE
THIS RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE HAS SOMETIMES BEEN USED TO SECURE THE INTERESTS OF THAT POLITICAL STATE OF THINGS TO WHICH HE BELONGED AT OTHER TIMES CATHOLICS HAVE TAKEN THE SIDE OF ARISTOCRACY FROM A SPIRIT OF RELIGION
IT LISTENS TO NO COMPROMISE WITH MORTAL MAN BUT REDUCING ALL THE HUMAN RACE TO THE SAME STANDARD IT CONFOUNDS ALL THE DISTINCTIONS OF SOCIETY AT THE FOOT OF THE SAME ALTAR EVEN AS THEY ARE CONFOUNDED IN THE SIGHT OF GOD
I FOUND TWO OR THREE THOUSAND PERSONS COLLECTED IN A VAST HALL WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM IN A SHORT TIME A PRIEST IN HIS ECCLESIASTICAL ROBES ADVANCED TO THE FRONT OF THE HUSTINGS THE SPECTATORS ROSE AND STOOD UNCOVERED
WERE MUNCHING THEIR BREAD STOLIDLY
WHILST I WAS IN AMERICA A WITNESS WHO HAPPENED TO BE CALLED AT THE ASSIZES OF THE COUNTY OF CHESTER
I WILL MAKE YOU UP A BASKET FOR YOUR JOURNEY SHALL I SAY A BOTTLE OF WINE EACH AND SOME BREAD
ETERNITY IS ONLY ONE MOTIVE OF THEIR DEVOTION TO THE CAUSE AND IF YOU CONVERSE WITH THESE MISSIONARIES OF CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO FIND HOW MUCH VALUE THEY SET UPON THE GOODS OF THIS WORLD
I HAVE JUST SHOWN WHAT THE DIRECT INFLUENCE OF RELIGION UPON POLITICS IS IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ITS INDIRECT INFLUENCE APPEARS TO ME TO BE STILL MORE CONSIDERABLE AND IT NEVER INSTRUCTS THE AMERICANS MORE FULLY IN THE ART OF BEING FREE
THEY WERE ROWED ASHORE IN THE LITTLE BOAT THE CRAFT CARRIED
WE MUST JOIN SOME LEADER HERE
AND OTHERS WHO DO THE SAME BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID TO BE SUSPECTED OF UNBELIEF CHRISTIANITY THEREFORE REIGNS WITHOUT ANY OBSTACLE BY UNIVERSAL CONSENT THE CONSEQUENCE IS
WHAT I HAVE PREVIOUSLY EXPLAINED THREE CIRCUMSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO CONTRIBUTE MOST POWERFULLY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES THE FIRST IS THAT FEDERAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THE AMERICANS HAVE ADOPTED
AND AT THE SAME TIME IMPART A TASTE FOR FREEDOM AND A KNOWLEDGE OF THE ART OF BEING FREE TO THE PEOPLE THE THIRD IS TO BE MET WITH IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE JUDICIAL POWER
THAT IT GO FORTH AGAIN TO FIGHT FOR THE LIBERTIES OF THE WORLD LORD TURN NOT THOU THY FACE FROM US AND GRANT THAT WE MAY ALWAYS BE THE MOST RELIGIOUS
THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT THERE IS NOT A DAY PASSES NOW THAT THE WIND IS FAIR THAT THREE OR FOUR BOATS DO NOT GO OFF TO BORDEAUX WITH PRODUCE FROM THE FARMS AND VINEYARDS OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T GET UP WITHOUT PAYING
IS TO BELIEVE IN SOME BLIND COSMOGONY OR TO ASSERT WITH CABANIS THE SECRETION OF THOUGHT BY THE BRAIN I CAN ONLY REPLY THAT THOSE WHO HOLD THIS LANGUAGE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN AMERICA AND THAT THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN A RELIGIOUS OR A FREE NATION
TO FOUND SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES THERE LEST RELIGION SHOULD BE SUFFERED TO DIE AWAY IN THOSE REMOTE SETTLEMENTS AND THE RISING STATES BE LESS FITTED TO ENJOY FREE INSTITUTIONS THAN THE PEOPLE FROM WHICH THEY EMANATED
RELIGION IS OFTEN UNABLE TO RESTRAIN MAN FROM THE NUMBERLESS TEMPTATIONS OF FORTUNE NOR CAN IT CHECK THAT PASSION FOR GAIN WHICH EVERY INCIDENT OF HIS LIFE CONTRIBUTES TO AROUSE BUT ITS INFLUENCE OVER THE MIND OF WOMAN IS SUPREME
AND THAT YOU MEET WITH A POLITICIAN WHERE YOU EXPECTED TO FIND A PRIEST THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT ALL THE AMERICAN REPUBLICS ARE COLLECTIVELY INVOLVED WITH EACH OTHER IF THE REPUBLICS OF THE WEST WERE TO FALL INTO ANARCHY OR TO BE MASTERED BY A DESPOT
I EXPECT THEY ARE WATCHING BOTH WAYS ANOTHER SAID
BUT NO SOONER IS THE PRIESTHOOD ENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS IS THE CASE IN THE UNITED STATES
THAT WILL BE AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER WAY AND SAVE MUCH TROUBLE IT IS A LONG CHASE TO CATCH A PACK OF WOLVES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT ONE CAN MAKE SHORT WORK OF THEM ALL WHEN YOU GET THEM PENNED UP IN AN INCLOSURE
ALTHOUGH THE POLITICAL WORLD IS ABANDONED TO THE DEBATES AND THE EXPERIMENTS OF MEN THUS THE HUMAN MIND IS NEVER LEFT TO WANDER ACROSS A BOUNDLESS FIELD AND WHATEVER MAY BE ITS PRETENSIONS
AS HIS DUTIES WERE NOW OVER HE CAME ACROSS TO THEM WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING LADS HE ASKED
THEN WHEN THAT PESTILENT QUEEN OF NAVARRE AND HER BOY ARE IN OUR HANDS THE WHOLE THING WILL BE OVER AND THE LAST EDICT WILL BE CARRIED OUT AND EACH HUGUENOT WILL HAVE THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE MASS AND THE GALLOWS WELL I WILL HAVE ONE MORE STOUP OF WINE
THESE TWO CAUSES INDUCE THEM UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ADOPT POLITICAL DOCTRINES WHICH THEY WOULD PERHAPS SUPPORT WITH LESS ZEAL IF THEY WERE RICH AND PREPONDERANT
AND WHICH ENABLES THE UNION TO COMBINE THE POWER OF A GREAT EMPIRE WITH THE SECURITY OF A SMALL STATE THE SECOND CONSISTS IN THOSE MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH LIMIT THE DESPOTISM OF THE MAJORITY
FOR WHO CAN SEARCH THE HUMAN HEART BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT THEY HOLD IT TO BE INDISPENSABLE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS THIS OPINION IS NOT PECULIAR TO A CLASS OF CITIZENS OR TO A PARTY BUT IT BELONGS TO THE WHOLE NATION AND TO EVERY RANK OF SOCIETY
SO THERE IS NO MORE WOLF HUNTING FOR ME BUT EVEN IF I HAD MY RIGHT HAND BACK AGAIN I SHOULD NOT CARE FOR ANY MORE SUCH ROUGH SPORT AS THAT PHILIP CONGRATULATED HIMSELF THAT HE WAS SITTING WITH HIS BACK TO THE SPEAKER FOR HE REMEMBERED THE INCIDENT WELL
THE CLERGY OF ALL THE DIFFERENT SECTS HOLD THE SAME LANGUAGE
TO DESPISE THE NATURAL BONDS AND LEGITIMATE PLEASURES OF HOME IS TO CONTRACT A TASTE FOR EXCESSES A RESTLESSNESS OF HEART AND THE EVIL OF FLUCTUATING DESIRES AGITATED BY THE TUMULTUOUS PASSIONS WHICH FREQUENTLY DISTURB HIS DWELLING
I MET WITH WEALTHY NEW ENGLANDERS WHO ABANDONED THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY WERE BORN IN ORDER TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF FREEDOM ON THE BANKS OF THE MISSOURI OR IN THE PRAIRIES OF ILLINOIS
FOR HE FELT SO INCLINED TO RETORT HIMSELF THAT HE FEARED THEY MIGHT GIVE WAY TO A SIMILAR IMPULSE
ALMIGHTY GOD HEAR OUR SUPPLICATIONS THIS DAY SAVE THE POLES WE BESEECH THEE IN THE NAME OF THY WELL BELOVED SON OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST WHO DIED UPON THE CROSS FOR THE SALVATION OF MEN
OPINION OF THE AMERICANS ON THE POLITICAL UTILITY OF RELIGION THEIR EXERTIONS TO EXTEND AND SECURE ITS PREDOMINANCE
AND WHO FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE WHATEVER BE THE COLORS THEY WEAR IT IS NOT TO THESE THAT I ADDRESS MYSELF BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO LOOK FORWARD TO THE REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT AS A TRANQUIL AND LASTING STATE
BUT IT SEEKS RATHER TO JUSTIFY ITS RESULTS THE PRIESTS IN AMERICA HAVE DIVIDED THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD INTO TWO PARTS IN THE ONE THEY PLACE THE DOCTRINES OF REVEALED RELIGION WHICH COMMAND THEIR ASSENT
FOR I APPLY IT NOT ONLY TO MANNERS IN THEIR PROPER SENSE OF WHAT CONSTITUTES THE CHARACTER OF SOCIAL INTERCOURSE BUT I EXTEND IT TO THE VARIOUS NOTIONS AND OPINIONS CURRENT AMONG MEN AND TO THE MASS OF THOSE IDEAS WHICH CONSTITUTE THEIR CHARACTER OF MIND
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SOCIETY SHOULD ESCAPE DESTRUCTION IF THE MORAL TIE BE NOT STRENGTHENED IN PROPORTION AS THE POLITICAL TIE IS RELAXED
THESE HABITS OF RESTRAINT RECUR IN POLITICAL SOCIETY AND ARE SINGULARLY FAVORABLE BOTH TO THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE PEOPLE AND TO THE DURABILITY OF THE INSTITUTIONS IT HAS ESTABLISHED
WE HAD LITTLE TO BOAST OF WHEN THE FIGHT WAS OVER AT ANY RATE I GOT A MARK OF THE WOLVES TEETH WHICH HAS PUT A STOP TO MY HUNTING AS YOU SEE AND HE HELD OUT HIS ARM I LEFT MY RIGHT HAND ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE IT WAS IN THE FIGHT ROUND CONDE A
IF A POLITICAL CHARACTER ATTACKS A SECT THIS MAY NOT PREVENT EVEN THE PARTISANS OF THAT VERY SECT FROM SUPPORTING HIM BUT IF HE ATTACKS ALL THE SECTS TOGETHER EVERYONE ABANDONS HIM AND HE REMAINS ALONE
THEY ALL DIFFER IN RESPECT TO THE WORSHIP WHICH IS DUE FROM MAN TO HIS CREATOR BUT THEY ALL AGREE IN RESPECT TO THE DUTIES WHICH ARE DUE FROM MAN TO MAN EACH SECT ADORES THE DEITY IN ITS OWN PECULIAR MANNER
FOR WITH THIS WIND HE MAY WELL HOPE TO ARRIVE AT BORDEAUX IN TIME TO GET HIS CARGO DISCHARGED BY NIGHTFALL THAT WAS A LUCKY STROKE INDEED
CHAPTER TEN THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE THE SUN HAD JUST RISEN WHEN MAITRE BERTRAM ACCOMPANIED BY FOUR MEN IN THE ATTIRE OF PEASANTS WENT DOWN TO THE PORT
IF CATHOLICISM PREDISPOSES THE FAITHFUL TO OBEDIENCE IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT PREPARE THEM FOR INEQUALITY BUT THE CONTRARY MAY BE SAID OF PROTESTANTISM WHICH GENERALLY TENDS TO MAKE MEN INDEPENDENT MORE THAN TO RENDER THEM EQUAL
AND MAY THY STRENGTH SUSTAIN THEIR ARMS SHED FORTH THY TERROR OVER THEIR ENEMIES SCATTER THE POWERS WHICH TAKE COUNSEL AGAINST THEM AND VOUCHSAFE THAT THE INJUSTICE WHICH THE WORLD HAS WITNESSED FOR FIFTY YEARS
THOU WHO DIDST MAKE THEM TRIUMPH OVER A HATEFUL OPPRESSION AND HAST GRANTED TO OUR PEOPLE THE BENEFITS OF LIBERTY AND PEACE TURN O LORD A FAVORABLE EYE UPON THE OTHER HEMISPHERE
AND THE OTHER TWO ALSO ASSENTED VERY WELL THEN THE LANDLORD SAID MY COUSIN WILL BE HERE IN THE MORNING FOR HE IS GOING TO LEAVE TWO OR THREE BARRELS OF LAST YEAR'S VINTAGE WITH ME
ARE AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST FAITHFUL BELIEVERS AND THE MOST ZEALOUS CITIZENS IT MAY BE ASSERTED THAT IN THE UNITED STATES NO RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE DISPLAYS THE SLIGHTEST HOSTILITY TO DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS
THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM INTO THE NEW WORLD A FORM OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH I CANNOT BETTER DESCRIBE THAN BY STYLING IT A DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN RELIGION THIS SECT CONTRIBUTED POWERFULLY TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DEMOCRACY AND A REPUBLIC
OR WHERE CONJUGAL HAPPINESS IS MORE HIGHLY OR WORTHILY APPRECIATED IN EUROPE ALMOST ALL THE DISTURBANCES OF SOCIETY ARISE FROM THE IRREGULARITIES OF DOMESTIC LIFE
FROM HABIT MORE THAN FROM CONVICTION IN THE UNITED STATES THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY IS RELIGIOUS AND CONSEQUENTLY HYPOCRISY MUST BE COMMON BUT THERE IS NO COUNTRY IN THE WHOLE WORLD IN WHICH THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
AMEN THE WHOLE MEETING RESPONDED AMEN WITH DEVOTION INDIRECT INFLUENCE OF RELIGIOUS OPINIONS UPON POLITICAL SOCIETY IN THE UNITED STATES
THEY KEEP ALOOF FROM PARTIES AND FROM PUBLIC AFFAIRS IN THE UNITED STATES RELIGION EXERCISES BUT LITTLE INFLUENCE UPON THE LAWS AND UPON THE DETAILS OF PUBLIC OPINION BUT IT DIRECTS THE MANNERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND BY REGULATING DOMESTIC LIFE
RELIGION CONSIDERED AS A POLITICAL INSTITUTION WHICH POWERFULLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC AMONGST THE AMERICANS NORTH AMERICA PEOPLED BY MEN WHO PROFESSED A DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN CHRISTIANITY
OF THE STATE EXACT BUT WHEN THE AMERICAN RETIRES FROM THE TURMOIL OF PUBLIC LIFE TO THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY HE FINDS IN IT THE IMAGE OF ORDER AND OF PEACE THERE HIS PLEASURES ARE SIMPLE AND NATURAL
WE COME FROM NEAR THERE I THOUGHT YOUR TONGUE HAD A SMACK OF GASCON IN IT
RELIGION IN AMERICA TAKES NO DIRECT PART IN THE GOVERNMENT OF SOCIETY BUT IT MUST NEVERTHELESS BE REGARDED AS THE FOREMOST OF THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY FOR IF IT DOES NOT IMPART A TASTE FOR FREEDOM
CHRISTIAN MORALITY COMMON TO ALL SECTS INFLUENCE OF RELIGION UPON THE MANNERS OF THE AMERICANS RESPECT FOR THE MARRIAGE TIE
IT IS CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY BARRIERS WHICH IT CANNOT SURMOUNT BEFORE IT CAN PERPETRATE INNOVATION CERTAIN PRIMAL AND IMMUTABLE PRINCIPLES ARE LAID DOWN AND THE BOLDEST CONCEPTIONS OF HUMAN DEVICE ARE SUBJECTED TO CERTAIN FORMS
WHO ACTED AS SPOKESMAN HAD ON ENTERING ASKED THE LANDLORD IF THEY COULD SLEEP THERE
I HAVE SHOWN IN WHAT MANNER THE COURTS OF JUSTICE SERVE TO REPRESS THE EXCESSES OF DEMOCRACY AND HOW THEY CHECK AND DIRECT THE IMPULSES OF THE MAJORITY WITHOUT STOPPING ITS ACTIVITY
AND FROM THE EARLIEST SETTLEMENT OF THE EMIGRANTS POLITICS AND RELIGION CONTRACTED AN ALLIANCE WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN DISSOLVED ABOUT FIFTY YEARS AGO IRELAND BEGAN TO POUR A CATHOLIC POPULATION INTO THE UNITED STATES
IN THE OTHER THEY LEAVE THOSE TRUTHS WHICH THEY BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN FREELY LEFT OPEN TO THE RESEARCHES OF POLITICAL INQUIRY
TO HARMONIZE THE STATE IN WHICH HE LIVES UPON EARTH WITH THE STATE WHICH HE BELIEVES TO AWAIT HIM IN HEAVEN THE GREATEST PART OF BRITISH AMERICA WAS PEOPLED BY MEN WHO AFTER HAVING SHAKEN OFF THE AUTHORITY OF THE POPE ACKNOWLEDGED NO OTHER RELIGIOUS SUPREMACY
FOR WE MARCH AT DAYBREAK HOW MANY RIDE OUT WITH YOU THE MAN WHO HAD LOST HIS HAND ASKED A HUNDRED THE TOWN HAS VOTED THE FUNDS AND WE MARCH TO JOIN D'ESCARS TOMORROW I BELIEVE WE ARE NOT GOING TO PERIGUEUX
AND AID HIM WITH HIS OTHER GOODS IT WILL SAVE HIM FROM HAVING TO EMPLOY MEN THERE
ALMOST ALL THE SECTS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE COMPRISED WITHIN THE GREAT UNITY OF CHRISTIANITY AND CHRISTIAN MORALITY IS EVERYWHERE THE SAME IT MAY BE BELIEVED WITHOUT UNFAIRNESS THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF AMERICANS PURSUE A PECULIAR FORM OF WORSHIP
IT REGULATES THE STATE I DO NOT QUESTION THAT THE GREAT AUSTERITY OF MANNERS WHICH IS OBSERVABLE IN THE UNITED STATES ARISES IN THE FIRST INSTANCE FROM RELIGIOUS FAITH
THEY DID NOT APPROACH THE TOWN BUT KEEPING BEHIND IT CAME DOWN UPON THE ROAD RUNNING ALONG THE SHORE THREE MILES BEYOND IT AND WALKED ALONG IT UNTIL ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK BY WHICH TIME ALL WERE THOROUGHLY TIRED WITH THEIR UNACCUSTOMED EXERCISE LEAVING THE ROAD THEY FOUND A SHELTERED SPOT AMONG THE SAND HILLS
DESPOTISM MAY GOVERN WITHOUT FAITH BUT LIBERTY CANNOT RELIGION IS MUCH MORE NECESSARY IN THE REPUBLIC WHICH THEY SET FORTH IN GLOWING COLORS THAN IN THE MONARCHY WHICH THEY ATTACK AND IT IS MORE NEEDED IN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICS
AND IT WAS HIS ARM THAT HAD STRUCK THE BLOW HIS VISOR HAD BEEN UP BUT AS HIS FACE WAS SHADED BY THE HELMET AND CHEEK PIECES
THIS HAS BEEN YOUR DOING MY KIND BROTHER SAID HE BUT HOW CAME YOU TO DISCOVER ME I MISSED YOU WHEN THE DAWN BROKE AND AT LAST FOUND YOU HERE SLEEPING UNDER THE DEW AND HAS NONE ELSE BEEN ASTIR INQUIRED WALLACE THINKING OF THE FIGURE HE HAD SEEN
WALTER BLUNT IS A PARLOUS EVIL MINDED KNAVE AND METHINKS WILL DO WHATEVER EVIL HE PROMISETH I FEAR HIM NOT SAID MYLES AGAIN BUT HIS HEART FOREBODED TROUBLE
HOW HE HAD REDEEMED THE GLEN FROM ITS DISGRACEFUL CONDITION AND RESTORED IT TO ITS FORMER BEAUTY HE ASKED THEM TO OBSERVE WEBB'S PRETTY HOMESTEAD NO LONGER MARRED BY THE UNSIGHTLY SIGN UPON THE BARN AND THEN
THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS QUICK TO CATCH THE LACK OF SYMPATHY IN THE AUDIENCE STOOD UP AND BEGGED LEAVE TO REPLY TO YOUNG FORBES HE SAID THE OBJECTION TO ADVERTISING SIGNS WAS ONLY A RICH MAN'S ARISTOCRATIC HOBBY
WAS THE FACT THAT HE WAS COMING FORWARD FOR RE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER AND BELIEVED THAT THIS AFFORDED A GOOD CHANCE TO MEET SOME OF HIS CONSTITUENTS AND MAKE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION SO HE CAME EARLY AND SHOOK HANDS WITH EVERYONE THAT ARRIVED AND AFTERWARD TOOK AS PROMINENT A SEAT AS POSSIBLE INDEED
E N THOUGH MY TRADE BE MAKING OF BLADES RATHER WOULD I HA A GOOD STOUT CUDGEL IN MY HAND THAN THE BEST DAGGER THAT EVER WAS FORGED MYLES STOOD THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MOMENT OR TWO THEN LOOKING UP
THE GATHERING HAD AT FIRST THE APPEARANCE OF BEING A POLITICAL ONE SO ENTIRELY DID THE REPRESENTATIVE DOMINATE IT BUT MISTER WATSON TOOK THE PLATFORM AND SHYLY INTRODUCED THE SPEAKER OF THE EVENING THE FARMERS ALL KNEW MISTER WATSON AND LIKED HIM
MYLES AND GASCOYNE WERE THROWING THEIR DAGGERS FOR A WAGER AT A WOODEN TARGET AGAINST THE WALL BACK OF THE ARMORER'S SMITHY
HE MIGHT FIND SOME BETTER WAY TO DO SO THAN BY ADVANCING SUCH CRAZY IDEAS BUT THIS CONTINUED THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS A SUBJECT OF SMALL IMPORTANCE WHAT HE WISHED ESPECIALLY TO CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD SERVED THE DISTRICT FAITHFULLY AS REPRESENTATIVE
AND THAT IT COULD NOT BE INDULGED IN A DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITY OF HONEST PEOPLE HIS OWN FIRM HE SAID BOUGHT THOUSANDS OF BUSHELS OF OATS FROM THE FARMERS AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE CELEBRATED EAGLE EYE BREAKFAST FOOD THREE PACKAGES FOR A QUARTER
I TAKE NO SUCH COWARD'S PART AS THAT I SAY AN THEY HUNGER TO FIGHT GIVE THEM THEIR STOMACHFUL THE OTHERS WERE VERY RELUCTANT FOR SUCH EXTREME MEASURES BUT MYLES AS USUAL CARRIED HIS WAY AND SO A PITCHED BATTLE WAS DECIDED UPON
AND SEEING THEM LAID TO REST PLANTED HIS MEN TO KEEP GUARD AROUND THE CIRCLE THE MOON HAD SUNK IN THE WEST BEFORE THE WHOLE OF HIS LITTLE CAMP WERE ASLEEP BUT WHEN ALL SEEMED COMPOSED HE WANDERED FORTH BY THE DIM LIGHT OF THE STARS TO VIEW THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY
THEY WISHED WELL TO THE ARMS OF SIR WILLIAM WALLACE AND SHOULD HE CONTINUE SUCCESSFUL WOULD WATCH THE MOMENT TO AID HIM WITH ALL THEIR LITTLE POWER THOSE WHO HAD MUCH PROPERTY FEARED TO RISK ITS LOSS BY EMBRACING A DOUBTFUL STRUGGLE
IT WOULD COST THE BOY SOMETHING BUT HE WOULD GAIN HIS MONEY'S WORTH IN EXPERIENCE AFTER A FEW DAYS THE SIGN PAINTER ANSWERED THE LETTER HE WOULD RELINQUISH THE THREE SIGNS IN THE GLEN FOR A PAYMENT OF FIFTY DOLLARS EACH
BUT EXPOSE THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE REVENGE OF A RESENTFUL ENEMY THIS WAS THE BEST APOLOGY OF ANY THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED NATURAL AFFECTION WAS THE PLEADER AND THOUGH BLINDED TO ITS TRUE INTEREST SUCH WEAKNESS HAD AN AMIABLE SOURCE AND SO WAS PARDONED
THOU'LT HAVE CAUSE TO FEAR ME ERE I AM THROUGH WITH THEE HE SMILED A BALEFUL LINGERING SMILE AND THEN TURNED SLOWLY AND WALKED AWAY WHAT THINKEST THOU MYLES SAID GASCOYNE AS THE TWO LEFT THE ARMORY TOGETHER I THINK NAUGHT SAID MYLES GRUFFLY
WHEN THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE WERE GATHERED IN THE BRUTUS TOWER SEE YE NOT THAT THEY GROW AS BAD AS EVER AN WE PUT NOT A STOP TO THIS OVERMASTERY NOW IT WILL NEVER STOP BEST LET IT BE MYLES SAID WILKES THEY WILL KILL THEE AN THOU CEASE NOT TROUBLING THEM
OTHER AND FAR MORE BITTER BATTLES LAY BEFORE HIM ERE HE COULD LOOK AROUND HIM AND SAY I HAVE WON THE VICTORY FOR A DAY FOR TWO DAYS THE BACHELORS WERE DEMORALIZED AT THE FALL OF THEIR LEADER
SO HE EXHORTED THEM EARNESTLY TO KEEP THEIR HOMES BEAUTIFUL AND FREE FROM THE DEGRADATION OF ADVERTISING AND NEVER TO PERMIT GLARING COMMERCIALISM TO MAR THE SCENERY AROUND THEM HE TOLD THEM WHAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BY HIMSELF IN A SHORT TIME
IT WAS GASCOYNE WHO SUGGESTED THE PLAN WHICH THEY AFTERWARDS FOLLOWED THEN WILKES STARTED AWAY TO GATHER TOGETHER THOSE OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE NOT UPON HOUSEHOLD DUTY
BLUNT IS GOING TO SERVE THEE OUT TO DAY AND I MYSELF HEARD HIM SAY SO HE SAYS HE IS GOING TO SLIT THINE EARS AND THEN HE WAS GONE AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD APPEARED MYLES DARTED AFTER HIM CAUGHT HIM MIDWAY IN THE QUADRANGLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK BY THE SCUFF OF THE NECK SQUALLING AND STRUGGLING
OR WERE VISITED IN VISION BY SOME HEROIC SHADE WHO OFFERED TO HIS SLEEPING FANCY DESIGNS FAR VASTER THAN HIS WAKING FACULTIES COULD HAVE CONCEIVED HE HAD THOUGHT THAT THE YOUNG WALLACE MIGHT HAVE WON DUMBARTON BY A BOLD STROKE AND THAT WHEN HIS INVINCIBLE COURAGE SHOULD BE STEERED BY STROKE
SO WHEN KENNETH ROSE THEY PREPARED TO LISTEN IN RESPECTFUL SILENCE USUALLY A YOUNG MAN MAKING HIS MAIDEN SPEECH IS SOMEWHAT DIFFIDENT BUT YOUNG FORBES WAS SO THOROUGHLY IN EARNEST AND SO INDIGNANT AT THE OPPOSITION THAT HIS PLANS HAD ENCOUNTERED
INDEED SOME WERE PROUD OF THEM AND BELIEVED IT A MARK OF DISTINCTION TO HAVE THEIR FENCES AND SHEDS ANNOUNCE AN EYE REMEDY OR SEVERAL VARIETIES OF PICKLES MISTER WATSON AT FIRST AN AMUSED OBSERVER OF THE CAMPAIGN SOON BECAME INDIGNANT AT THE WAY THAT KENNETH WAS RIDICULED AND REVILED
DRIVE OUT ONE AND ANOTHER WILL TAKE HIS PLACE THEY PAY LIBERALLY FOR LOCATIONS PSHAW TEN DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ROCK AS BIG AS A BARN BUT THEY RENT THOUSANDS OF SUCH POSITIONS AND IN THE AGGREGATE OUR FARMERS GET LARGE SUMS FROM THEM
MYLES HAD RISEN AND WAS NOW STANDING LISTENING WITH THE OTHERS WHEN BLUNT HAD ENDED READING THE LIST OF NAMES HE ROLLED UP THE PARCHMENT AND THRUST IT INTO HIS BELT THEN SWINGING SUDDENLY ON HIS HEEL HE STRODE STRAIGHT UP TO MYLES FACING HIM FRONT TO FRONT
NEVER WILL I FORGET OR FORGIVE THAT OFFENCE AND WILL HAVE A RECKONING WITH THEE RIGHT SOON THAT THOU WILT NOT FORGET TO THE LAST DAY OF THY LIFE WHEN MYLES HAD SEEN HIS ENEMY TURN UPON HIM HE DID NOT KNOW AT FIRST WHAT TO EXPECT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED HAD THEY COME TO BLOWS THERE AND THEN
I'LL DRIVE EVERY ADVERTISING SIGN OUT OF THIS COUNTRY IMPOSSIBLE THE GREAT CORPORATIONS WHO CONTROL THESE INDUSTRIES MAKE THEIR FORTUNES BY THIS STYLE OF ADVERTISING THE RURAL DISTRICTS ARE THEIR STRONGHOLDS AND THEY MUST ADVERTISE OR THEY CAN'T SELL THEIR PRODUCTS
THEY WERE HAILED BY A GROUP OF THE BACHELORS STANDING AT THE STONE STEPS OF THE GREAT BUILDING HOLLOA FALWORTH THEY CRIED KNOWEST THOU THAT BLUNT IS NIGH WELL AGAIN NAY SAID MYLES I KNEW IT NOT BUT I AM RIGHT GLAD TO HEAR IT
SOME WERE TOO GREAT COWARDS TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS THEY WOULD GLADLY REGAIN BY THE EXERTIONS OF OTHERS
AND WHERE THE POSSESSION OF SUCH A CASTLE WOULD COMPEL THE NEIGHBORING ONES TO SURRENDER AND WHERE OCCUPYING THE HILLS WITH BANDS OF RESOLUTE SCOTS WOULD BE A MORE EFFICIENT BULWARK THAN A THOUSAND TOWERS THAT MAXWELL GAZED ON HIM WITH ADMIRATION AND LENNOX WITH WONDER
AND HE HELD HIMSELF PREPARED FOR ANY EVENT HE FACED THE OTHER PLUCKILY ENOUGH AND WITHOUT FLINCHING AND SPOKE UP BOLDLY IN ANSWER SO BE IT WALTER BLUNT I FEAR THEE NOT IN WHATEVER WAY THOU MAYST ENCOUNTER ME
WHEN OF A SUDDEN HIS HEART GAVE A GREAT LEAP WITHIN HIM IT WAS WALTER BLUNT HE CAME WALKING IN AT THE DOOR AS IF NOTHING HAD PASSED AND AT HIS UNEXPECTED COMING THE HUBBUB OF TALK AND LAUGHTER WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED
AND THAT WHEN HIS INVINCIBLE COURAGE SHOULD BE STEERED BY GRAVER HEADS EVERY SUCCESS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM HIS ARMS AND SAW THAT WHEN TURNED TO ANY CAUSE OF POLICY THE GORDIAN KNOT OF IT HE DID UNLOOSE FAMILIAR AS HIS GARTER HE MARVELED AND SAID WITHIN HIMSELF
KENNETH FLUSHED RED HE WAS BY NATURE SHY AND RETIRING TO A DEGREE ONLY HIS PENT UP ENTHUSIASM HAD CARRIED HIM THROUGH THE ORDEAL AND NOW THAT IT WAS OVER HE WAS CHAGRINED TO THINK THAT THE SPEECH HAD BEEN SO INEFFECTIVE
THAT HE FORGOT THAT IT WAS HIS FIRST PUBLIC SPEECH AND THOUGHT ONLY OF IMPRESSING HIS HEARERS WITH HIS VIEWS EXULTING IN THE FACT THAT ON THIS OCCASION THEY COULD NOT TALK BACK AS THEY USUALLY DID IN PRIVATE
BLUNT'S COMPANIONS WERE TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM AGAINST SOMETHING BUT WITHOUT AVAIL IT WAS MYLES'S HEART THRILLED AND HIS BLOOD BOILED TO LIE IN WAIT FOR HIM TO OVERPOWER HIM BY NUMBERS AND TO MUTILATE HIM BY SLITTING HIS EARS
THERE MY DEAR LORD SAID HE PRESENTING IT IT WILL NOT DISHONOR YOUR HAND FOR IT CUT DOWN MANY A PROUD NORWEGIAN ON THE FIELD OF LARGS WALLACE TOOK THE SWORD AND TURNED TO MEET MURRAY WITH EDWIN IN THE PORTAL WHEN THEY REACHED THE CITADEL
GIVE IT UP MY BOY ADVISED THE ELDER MAN LAYING A KINDLY HAND ON THE YOUTH'S SHOULDER IT REALLY ISN'T WORTH THE STRUGGLE BUT I CAN'T GIVE IT UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF BEATEN PROTESTED KENNETH ALMOST READY TO WEEP WITH DISAPPOINTMENT
AND GASOLINE AND AN EQUIPMENT OF SCRUBBING BRUSHES PARSONS THE FARMER CAME OVER TO WATCH THIS NOVEL PROCEEDING HAPPY IN THE POSSESSION OF THREE CRISP FIVE DOLLAR NOTES GIVEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT MADE WITH HIM
THAT THOU WERT GOING THITHER FOR THY ARBALIST THIS MORN TO SHOOT AT THE ROOKS WITHAL THAT WILL DO ROBIN SAID MYLES THOU MAYST GO AND THEREWITH THE LITTLE IMP SCURRIED OFF PULLING THE LOBES OF HIS EARS SUGGESTIVELY AS HE DARTED AROUND THE CORNER
NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE NOVEL IDEAS OF THE YOUNG ARTIST AS BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED TO BE AMUSED BY HEARING THE BOYISH MASTER OF ELMHURST LECTURE AT EM SO THEY FILLED THE LITTLE ROOM TO OVERFLOWING AND TO ADD TO THE DIGNITY OF THE PROCEEDINGS
PEOPLE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THESE THINGS SO LONG THAT THE MANUFACTURERS CONSIDER THEMSELVES JUSTIFIED IN COVERING EVERY BARN ROCK AND FENCE WITH THEIR SIGNS I SEE NO WAY TO STOP THEM NOR I AT PRESENT BUT THERE MUST BE A WAY
THAT BRAVE KNIGHT HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE VERY SAME NIGHT IN WHICH DE VALENCE FLED BEFORE THE ARMS OF WALLACE ACROSS THE CLYDE AND HE NO SOONER SAW THE SCOTTISH COLORS ON THE WALLS OF DUMBARTON THAN FINDING OUT WHO WAS THEIR PLANTER
AND THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE WERE PROPORTIONATELY UPLIFTED THE DAY THAT BLUNT MET HIS FALL
WHO WAS IT STOLE THEIR TANK IF THEY DID BUT KNOW HE SHOULD SMART FOR IT
ON THE FARM NEAREST TO ELMHURST AT THE NORTH WHICH BELONGED TO A MAN NAMED WEBB WAS A BARN FACING THE ROAD THAT DISPLAYED ON ITS SIDE A TOBACCO SIGN KENNETH INTERVIEWED MISTER WEBB AND FOUND THAT HE RECEIVED NO MONEY FOR THE SIGN BUT THE MAN CONTENDED
A COUNCIL BEING HELD RESPECTING THE DISPOSAL OF THE NEW TROOPS IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE LENNOX MEN MUST REMAIN WITH THEIR EARL IN GARRISON WHILE THOSE BROUGHT BY MAXWELL AND UNDER HIS COMMAND SHOULD FOLLOW WALLACE IN THE PROSECUTION OF HIS CONQUESTS ALONG WITH HIS OWN ESPECIAL PEOPLE
LORD MAR PROPOSED TRAVELING ALL NIGHT BUT AT THE CLOSE OF THE EVENING HIS COUNTESS COMPLAINED OF FATIGUE DECLARING SHE COULD NOT ADVANCE FURTHER THAN THE EASTERN BANK OF THE RIVER CART
ONE EVENING THE BACHELORS WERE MORE THAN USUALLY NOISY IN THEIR END OF THE DORMITORY LAUGHING AND TALKING AND SHOUTING TO ONE ANOTHER HOLLOA YOU SIRRAH FALWORTH CALLED ONE OF THEM ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM BLUNT COMETH AGAIN TO MORROW DAY
HE WILL NOT DARE TO TOUCH ME TO HARM ME I FEAR HIM NOT NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT SPEAK THE FULL FEELINGS OF HIS HEART I KNOW NOT MYLES SAID GASCOYNE SHAKING HIS HEAD DOUBTFULLY
EVEN IF MYLES HAD ENTERTAINED COMFORTING THOUGHTS TO THE CONTRARY HE WAS SPEEDILY UNDECEIVED ONE MORNING ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE FIGHT AS HE AND GASCOYNE WERE CROSSING THE ARMORY COURT
HIS COUNTRY'S ENEMIES HAD LEVELED WITH THE GROUND HE TURNED IN ANGUISH OF HEART TOWARD THE SOUTH FOR THERE LESS RACKING REMEMBRANCES HOVERED OVER THE DISTANT HILLS LEANING ON THE SHATTERED STUMP OF AN OLD TREE HE FIXED HIS EYES ON THE FAR STRETCHING PLAIN
BUT WHEN SCOTLAND LOST HER FREEDOM AS THE SWORD WAS NOT DRAWN IN HER DEFENSE I LOOKED NOT WHERE IT LAY I THEN STUDIED THE ARTS OF PEACE THAT IS OVER AND NOW THE PASSION OF MY SOUL REVIVES WHEN THE MIND IS BENT ON ONE OBJECT ONLY
LISTENED TO THEM AS THEY DESCRIBED THE WEAPONS NAY NAY MASTER MYLES SAID HE WHEN MYLES HAD ENDED BY TELLING THE USE TO WHICH HE INTENDED PUTTING THEM THOU ART GOING ALL WRONG IN THIS MATTER WITH SUCH BLADES ERE THIS BATTLE IS ENDED SOME ONE WOULD BE SLAIN AND SO MURDER DONE
AND SANCTIONED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE EARL OF LENNOX WHOSE NAME HELD A GREAT INFLUENCE IN THOSE PARTS SEVERAL WHO BEFORE HAD HELD BACK FROM DOUBTING THEIR OWN JUDGMENT NOW CAME FORWARD AND NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED WELL APPOINTED MEN MARCHED INTO THE FORTRESS
IF MYLES FANCIED THAT ONE SINGLE VICTORY OVER HIS ENEMY WOULD CURE THE EVIL AGAINST WHICH HE FOUGHT HE WAS GRIEVOUSLY MISTAKEN WRONGS ARE NOT RIGHTED SO EASILY AS THAT IT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING
BUT IT FLED AND AGAIN VANISHED HE DROPPED UPON THE GROUND IN SPEECHLESS DISAPPOINTMENT TIS FALSE CRIED HE RECOVERING FROM HIS FIRST EXPECTATION TIS A PHANTOM OF MY OWN CREATING
WHAT ARISTOCRATIC NOTION COULD PREVENT HIM IT WAS A MIGHTY GOOD THING FOR THE FARMERS TO BE REMINDED BY MEANS OF THE SIGNS ON THEIR BARNS AND FENCES OF THE THINGS THEY NEEDED IN DAILY LIFE IF THE YOUNG MAN AT ELMHURST WOULD LIKE TO BE OF PUBLIC SERVICE
AND DESERVED THEIR SUFFRAGES FOR RENOMINATION AND THEN HE BEGAN TO DISCUSS POLITICAL QUESTIONS IN GENERAL AND HIS OWN MERITS IN PARTICULAR SO THAT KENNETH AND MISTER WATSON DISGUSTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HAD CAPTURED THE MEETING
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT NO OTHER COMPETING SIGNS WERE TO TAKE THEIR PLACE KENNETH PROMPTLY MAILED A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNT DEMANDED AND EARLY NEXT MORNING STARTED FOR THE GLEN WITH WHAT HE CALLED HIS ELIMINATORS THESE ELIMINATORS CONSISTED OF TWO MEN WITH CANS OF TURPENTINE
THEN THE FAMILY OF HIM WHO WAS KILLED WOULD HAPLY HAVE YE CITED
AND SUMMONING HIS LITTLE RESERVE THEY MARCHED WITH FLYING PENNONS THROUGH THE TOWN OF DUMBARTON
THEY SOLD THIS BREAKFAST FOOD TO THOUSANDS OF FARMERS TO GIVE THEM HEALTH AND STRENGTH TO HARVEST ANOTHER CROP OF OATS THUS HE BENEFITED THE COMMUNITY GOING AND COMING WHAT SHOULD HE NOT ADVERTISE THIS MUTUAL BENEFIT COMMODITY WHEREVER HE PLEASED AND ESPECIALLY AMONG THE FARMERS
WHICH PAINTED SIGNS WHEREVER IT COULD SECURE SPACE THESE SIGNS WERE NOT WORKS OF ART BUT THEY WERE DISTINCTLY HELPFUL TO BUSINESS AND ONLY A FOOL IN THE OPINION OF THE HONORABLE ERASTUS WOULD PROTEST AGAINST THE INEVITABLE WHAT BROUGHT THE LEGISLATOR TO THE MEETING
WHEN HE AWOKE THE LARK WAS CAROLING ABOVE HIS HEAD AND TO HIS SURPRISE HE FOUND A PLAID WAS LAID OVER HIM HE THREW IT OFF AND BEHELD EDWIN SEATED AT HIS FEET
FINDING EVERYBODY READY HE TOOK HIS STATION AND SETTING FORTH ALL PROCEEDED CHEERFULLY THOUGH SLOWLY THROUGH THE DELIGHTFUL VALLEYS OF BAROCHAN BY SUNSET THEY ARRIVED AT THE POINT OF EMBARKATION
EVEN MYLES STOPPED IN HIS SPEECH FOR A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED WITH A BEATING HEART AND A CARELESSNESS OF MANNER THAT WAS ALTOGETHER ASSUMED IN HIS HAND BLUNT CARRIED THE HOUSE ORDERS FOR THE DAY AND WITHOUT SEEMING TO NOTICE MYLES HE OPENED IT AND READ THE LIST OF THOSE CALLED UPON FOR HOUSEHOLD SERVICE
I DO INDEED FEAR ME THAT HE MEANETH TO DO THEE EVIL I KNOW NOT SAID MYLES BOLDLY BUT I FEAR HIM NOT NEVERTHELESS HIS HEART WAS HEAVY WITH THE WEIGHT OF IMPENDING ILL
A DISGRACEFUL PUNISHMENT ADMINISTERED AS A RULE ONLY FOR THIEVING AND POACHING HE WOULD NOT DARE TO DO SUCH A THING CRIED MYLES WITH HEAVING BREAST AND FLASHING EYES AYE BUT HE WOULD SAID GASCOYNE HIS FATHER LORD REGINALD BLUNT IS A GREAT MAN OVER NOTTINGHAM WAY
PRITHEE TELL IT ME ROBIN WHERE DO THEY PROPOSE TO LIE IN WAIT FOR FALWORTH IN THE GATE WAY OF THE BUTTERY COURT SO AS TO CATCH HIM WHEN HE PASSES BY TO THE ARMORY ANSWERED THE BOY ARE THEY THERE NOW SAID WILKES AYE NINE OF THEM SAID ROBIN
THE PURE SPIRIT OF MARION WOULD NEVER FLY FROM ME I LOVED HER TOO WELL SHE WOULD NOT THUS REDOUBLE MY GRIEF BUT I SHALL GO TO THEE WIFE OF MY SOUL CRIED HE AND THAT IS COMFORT BALM INDEED IS THE CHRISTIAN'S HOPE
AND NOW AND THEN APPLAUDING A MORE THAN USUALLY WELL AIMED CAST OF THE KNIFE SUDDENLY THAT IMPISH LITTLE PAGE SPOKEN OF BEFORE ROBIN INGOLDSBY THRUST HIS SHOCK HEAD AROUND THE CORNER OF THE SMITHY AND SAID HO FALWORTH
THESE FARMERS SEEM VERY HONEST DECENT FELLOWS THEY ARE KEN I WISH YOU KNEW THEM BETTER SO DO I MISTER WATSON THIS CAMPAIGN OUGHT TO BRING US CLOSER TOGETHER FOR I MEAN TO GET THEM TO HELP ME YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY THEM I'M AFRAID
HE APPEALED TO THEM TO HELP HIM IN DRIVING ALL THE ADVERTISING SIGNS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY WHEN HE ENDED THEY APPLAUDED HIS SPEECH MILDLY BUT IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE REASON THAT HE HAD SPOKEN SO FORCIBLY AND WELL THEN
AND MY LORD WOULD NOT DARE TO PUNISH HIM EVEN FOR SUCH A MATTER AS THAT BUT TELL ME ROBIN INGOLDSBY
HE WANTED THE YOUNG MAN TO ROUSE HIMSELF AND TAKE AN INTEREST IN LIFE AND IF HIS ANTAGONISM TO ADVERTISING SIGNS WOULD EFFECT THIS
ALL BECOMES CLEAR THAT LEADS TO IT ZEAL IN SUCH CASES IS ALMOST GENIUS SOON AFTER THESE OBSERVATIONS IT WAS ADMITTED THAT WALLACE MIGHT ATTEND LORD MAR AND HIS FAMILY ON THE MORROW TO THE ISLE OF BUTE
SUCH WERE HIS WORDS SUCH WERE HIS THOUGHTS TILL THE COLDNESS OF THE HOUR AND THE EXHAUSTION OF NATURE PUTTING A FRIENDLY SEAL UPON HIS SENSES HE SUNK UPON THE BANK AND FELL INTO A PROFOUND SLEEP
NOT ALL OF THEM THERE MUST BE SOME REFINEMENT AMONG THEM BUT THE LAWYER WAS NOT CONVINCED HOWEVER IT WAS NOT HIS DESIRE TO STIFLE THIS NEW BORN ENTHUSIASM OF KENNETH'S EVEN THOUGH HE BELIEVED IT MISDIRECTED
NO ONE DOUBTED THAT WILKES HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH IN HIS TAUNT AND THAT THE BACHELORS HAD INDEED STOLEN THEIR OWN TANK SO NO MORE WATER WAS EVER CARRIED FOR THE HEAD SQUIRES BUT IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT THE WAR FOR THE UPPERHAND WAS NOT YET OVER
WHICH ALONE SEEMED TO DIVIDE HIM FROM THE VENERABLE SIR RONALD CRAWFORD AND HIS YOUTHFUL HAUNTS AT AYR FULL OF THOUGHTS OF HER WHO USED TO SHARE THOSE HAPPY SCENES HE HEARD A SIGH BEHIND HIM HE TURNED ROUND AND BEHELD A FEMALE FIGURE DISAPPEAR AMONG THE TREES
I HEARD BLUNT TELL MOWBRAY TO GO AND GATHER THE OTHERS
THE HON ERASTUS HOPKINS STATE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE DISTRICT LENT HIS PRESENCE TO THE ASSEMBLAGE NOT THAT THE HONORABLE ERASTUS CARED A FIG ABOUT THIS FOOLISH TALK OF EXTERMINATING ADVERTISING SIGNS HE WAS HIMSELF A LARGE STOCKHOLDER IN A BREAKFAST FOOD FACTORY
SMOKE YE NOT THEIR TRICKS LADS SEE YE NOT THAT THEY HAVE STOLEN THEIR OWN WATER TANK SO THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE NO NEED FOR ANOTHER FIGHT OVER THE CARRYING OF THE WATER THE BACHELORS MADE AN OBVIOUS SHOW OF NOT HAVING HEARD WHAT HE SAID AND A GENERAL LAUGH WENT AROUND
AND A FEW BRAVE SPIRITS WHO WOULD PUT ALL TO THE HAZARD FOR SO GOOD A CAUSE COULD BE PREVAILED ON TO HOLD THEMSELVES IN READINESS TO OBEY SIR EUSTACE WHEN HE SHOULD SEE THE MOMENT TO CONDUCT THEM TO SIR WILLIAM WALLACE
TRUE ENOUGH IF YOU'RE SERIOUS KEN I'LL FRANKLY SAY THE THING CAN'T BE DONE YOU MAY PERHAPS BUY THE PRIVILEGE OF MAINTAINING THE ROCKS OF THE GLEN FREE FROM ADVERTISING BUT THE ADVERTISERS WILL PAINT MORE SIGNS ON ALL THE APPROACHES AND YOU WON'T HAVE GAINED MUCH
HIS SOUL TOOK FIRE AND STUNG WITH A GENEROUS AMBITION OF EQUALING IN GLORY HIS EQUAL IN YEARS HE DETERMINED TO ASSIST WHILE HE EMULATED THE VICTOR TO THIS END
LET THEM ADVERTISE IN DECENT WAYS THEN WHAT RIGHT HAS ANY SOAP MAKER TO FLAUNT HIS WARES IN MY FACE WHETHER I'M INTERESTED IN THEM OR NOT THE RIGHT OF CUSTOM
AND ACKNOWLEDGED FRANKLY THAT IT WAS A PITY TO DECORATE THEIR PREMISES WITH SIGNS OF PATENT MEDICINES AND QUESTIONABLE SOAPS BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM SNEERED AT THE CHAMPION AND MANY REFUSED POINT BLANK TO CONSIDER ANY PROPOSITION TO DISCARD THE ADVERTISEMENTS
LEFT THE SCHOOL HOUSE AND INDIGNANTLY RETURNED TO ELMHURST THIS MAN HOPKINS SAID MISTER WATSON ANGRILY IS NOT A GENTLEMAN HE'S AN IMPERTINENT MEDDLER HE RUINED ANY GOOD EFFECT MY SPEECH MIGHT HAVE CREATED SAID KENNETH GLOOMILY
EVEN BEFORE THAT COMING THE BACHELORS HAD SOMEWHAT RECOVERED FROM THEIR DEMORALIZATION AND NOW AGAIN THEY BEGAN TO PLUCK UP THEIR CONFIDENCE AND TO ORDER THE YOUNGER SQUIRES AND PAGES UPON THIS PERSONAL SERVICE OR UPON THAT SEE YE NOT SAID MYLES ONE DAY
BUT HIS ENERGY WAS NOT EXHAUSTED NO ONE EVER KNEW WHAT IT COST IN LABOR AND MATERIAL TO ERASE THOSE THREE SIGNS BUT AFTER TEN DAYS THEY HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY AND THE BOY HEAVED A SIGH OF SATISFACTION AND TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO EXTENDING THE CAMPAIGN
THAT HE WOULD HAVE THY BLOOD FOR THE FALL THOU GAVEST HIM LOOK TO THYSELF FALWORTH HE COMETH AGAIN WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY NEXT THOU STANDEST IN A PARLOUS STATE MYLES SAID GASCOYNE AS THEY ENTERED THE GREAT QUADRANGLE
WELL WELL LET'S THINK IT OVER KEN AND SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE PERHAPS THAT RASCALLY HOPKINS WAS RIGHT WHEN HE ADVISED YOU TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY I CAN'T DO BETTER THAN TO MAKE IT CLEAN TO DO AWAY WITH THESE DISREPUTABLE SIGNS SAID THE BOY STUBBORNLY
THERE SAID HE STILL PANTING FROM THE CHASE AND SEATING THE BOY BY NO MEANS GENTLY UPON THE BENCH BESIDE WILKES SIT THOU THERE THOU IMP OF EVIL AND NOW TELL ME WHAT THOU DIDST MEAN BY THY WORDS ANON
SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO LECTURE HIM ON FISHING IN TROUBLED WATERS AND WARNED HIM IF HE WOULD KEEP HIS HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS TO WEAR HIS YOKE IN PEACE OTHERS THOUGHT THE PROJECT TOO ARDUOUS FOR MEN OF SMALL MEANS
AN THOU STOP NOT THINE OUTCRY I WILL CUT THY THROAT FOR THEE AND HE MADE A FEROCIOUS GESTURE WITH HIS DAGGER IT WAS BY NO MEANS EASY TO WORM THE STORY FROM THE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MONKEY HE KNEW MYLES TOO WELL TO BE IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF HIS THREATS
LORD MAR BETWEEN MURRAY AND EDWIN FOLLOWED AND THE SERVANTS AND GUARD COMPLETED THE SUIT BEING WELL MOUNTED THEY PLEASANTLY PURSUED THEIR WAY AVOIDING ALL INHABITED PLACES AND RESTING IN THE DEEPEST RECESSES OF THE HILLS
ALL DAY THE TWO MEN SCRUBBED THE ROCKS FAITHFULLY ASSISTED AT ODD TIMES BY THEIR IMPATIENT EMPLOYER BUT THE THICK SPLASHES OF PAINT CLUNG DESPERATELY TO THE RUGGED SURFACE OF THE ROCK AND THE TASK WAS A HARD ONE
THAT NIGHT AS THE YOUNGSTERS WERE SHOUTING AND ROMPING AND SKYLARKING AS THEY ALWAYS DID BEFORE TURNING IN HE STOOD UPON HIS COT AND SHOUTED SILENCE LIST TO ME A LITTLE AND THEN IN THE HUSH THAT FOLLOWED
HE WAS TRYING HIS ELOQUENCE AMONG THE CLAN AT LENNOX WHEN KER ARRIVING STAMPED HIS PERSUASIONS WITH TRUTH AND ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED MEN ARRANGED THEMSELVES UNDER THEIR LORD'S STANDARD MAXWELL GLADLY EXPLAINED HIMSELF TO WALLACE'S LIEUTENANT
THE SILVER LIGHT OF THE STARS WAS NOT BRIGHTER THAN ITS AIRY ROBES WHICH FLOATED IN THE WIND HIS HEART PAUSED IT BEAT VIOLENTLY STILL THE FIGURE ADVANCED
MAR HAD SEEN THE POWER OF HIS ARMS MURRAY HAD ALREADY DRUNK THE EXPERIENCE OF A VETERAN FROM HIS GENIUS HENCE THEY WERE NOT SURPRISED ON HEARING THAT WHICH FILLED STRANGERS WITH AMAZEMENT
YOU WILL SEND YOUR HIRELINGS TO TOW HIM IN BUT IF A PLANK COULD SAVE HIM NOW YOU WOULD NOT THROW IT TO HIM I UNDERSTAND YOU SIRS AND SHALL TROUBLE YOUR PATRIOTISM NO MORE IN SHORT
THOU WILT SING A DIFFERENT SONG ANON SAID ONE OF THE BACHELORS I TELL THEE HE IS HOT AGAINST THEE AND SWEARS WHEN HE COMETH AGAIN HE WILL CARVE THEE SOOTHLY AYE MARRY SAID ANOTHER
MYLES SAW GASCOYNE DIRECT A SHARP GLANCE AT HIM BUT HE ANSWERED NOTHING EITHER TO HIS ENEMY'S WORDS OR HIS FRIEND'S LOOK AS THE BACHELOR HAD SAID BLUNT CAME THE NEXT MORNING
HE TRAVERSED THE ADJOINING COUNTRY STRIVING TO ENLIGHTEN THE UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE STUPIDLY SATISFIED AND TO EXCITE THE DISCONTENTED TO REVOLT WITH MOST HE FAILED
WHEN THE DAWN BROKE HE AROSE FROM HIS HEATHER BED IN THE GREAT TOWER AND HAVING CALLED FORTH TWENTY OF THE BOTHWELL MEN TO ESCORT THEIR LORD HE TOLD IRELAND HE SHOULD EXPECT TO HAVE A CHEERING ACCOUNT OF THE WOUNDED ON HIS RETURN
AMONG THEM WAS THAT OF HIS TASKMASTER FEARING PUNISHMENT FOR HIS NEGLECTED DUTY HE HAD SLIPPED OUT OF THE COT AND HIDDEN HIMSELF BENEATH IT THOSE WHO HAD ENTERED WERE WALTER BLUNT AND THREE OF THE OLDER BACHELORS
THEN HE JUMPED DOWN AGAIN FROM HIS ELEVATED STAND AND AN UPROAR OF CONFUSION INSTANTLY FILLED THE PLACE WHAT WAS THE EFFECT OF HIS WORDS UPON THE BACHELORS HE COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS THE RESULT HE WAS NOT SLOW IN DISCOVERING THE NEXT DAY
AND RUIN THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR HOMES AND FARMS MISTER WATSON SMILED THEY'RE NOT ARTISTS KEN THEY CAN'T REALIZE ON APPEARANCES BUT THEY CAN USE THE MONEY THE SIGNS BRING THEM THEY NEED TO BE EDUCATED THAT'S ALL
CHAPTER THREE DON QUIXOTE WHEN KENNETH GOT HOME HE TOLD MISTER WATSON OF HIS DISCOVERY AND ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO WRITE TO THE SIGN PAINTER AND FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE DONE THE LAWYER LAUGHED HEARTILY AT HIS YOUNG FRIEND'S WHIM BUT AGREED TO HELP HIM
NO MISTER WATSON I'M SET ON THIS IT'S A CRIME TO ALLOW THESE SIGNS TO FLAUNT THEMSELVES IN OUR PRETTIEST SCENES MY INSTINCT REVOLTS AT THE DESECRATION BESIDES
IT WAS JUST AFTER CHAPEL AND THE WHOLE BODY OF SQUIRES WAS GATHERED IN THE ARMORY WAITING FOR THE ORDERS OF THE DAY AND THE CALLING OF THE ROLL OF THOSE CHOSEN FOR HOUSEHOLD DUTY MYLES WAS SITTING ON A BENCH ALONG THE WALL TALKING AND JESTING WITH SOME WHO STOOD BY
ONE IS INCLINED TO DO MORE FOR A DUKE OF OMNIUM THAN FOR A MISTER JONES THE DUKES HAVE MORE TO OFFER THAN THE JONESES I DON'T MEAN IN THE WAY OF WEALTH ONLY BUT OF WHAT ONE ENJOYS MOST IN SOCIETY GENERALLY
IN THEIR PLACE OF REFUGE YET WHAT MATTERS
WHEN I COME UP TO YOUR BEDROOM THAT MORNING I REMEMBER IT THE FIRST TIME YES I REMEMBER IT BECAUSE I CAME TWICE MY LORD WHEN I CAME FIRST IT HADN'T BEEN DONE
AMONG THEM THEY GOT A LOT OF MONEY AS THE DUKE OUGHT TO REMEMBER HE IS NOT WITH THEM SAID SILVERBRIDGE AS THOUGH HE WERE IN SOME DEGREE MOURNING OVER THE FATE OF HIS UNFORTUNATE FRIEND I SUPPOSE CAPTAIN GREEN WAS THE LEADER IN ALL THAT
AND EVERYBODY KNEW AS YOUR LORDSHIP AND ME WAS TOGETHER IN HIM THEN HE BURST OUT INTO A PAROXYSM OF TEARS AND SOBBING THE YOUNG LORD CERTAINLY COULD NOT TAKE THE MAN INTO PARTNERSHIP AGAIN
NOR COULD HE RESTORE TO HIM EITHER THE HOUNDS OR HIS CLUB OR HIS CLEAN HANDS NOR DID HE KNOW IN WHAT WAY HE COULD SERVE THE MAN EXCEPT BY PUTTING HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET WHICH HE DID
TIFTO YES TIFTO
THEY SHALL PUNISH ME AND HIM TOO I'M IN THAT STATE OF MIND THAT ANY CHANGE WOULD BE FOR THE BETTER BUT HE HE OUGHT TO HAVE IT HEAVY IT WON'T BE DONE BY ME MAJOR TIFTO
THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH MADAME GOESLER ASKED PHINEAS FINN WHEN THEY HAD BOTH AGREED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO JUMP OVER THE BANK OUT OF THE WOOD AND IT WAS OF COURSE NECESSARY THAT SOME ANSWER SHOULD BE GIVEN TO IT
IF YOU CANNOT MOVE MORE SWIFTLY I MUST LEAVE YOU OR WE BOTH PERISH FLY BOY THEN AND LEAVE THY SIRE BUT I CANNOT FLY TO STARVE GIVE ME THY BAG OF GOLD AND THE YOUTH SNATCHED AT IT
YOU TURNED ME OUT THAT IS TRUE MAJOR TIFTO YOU WAS VERY ROUGH THEN WASN'T YOU ROUGH A MAN'S BEDROOM IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE
AND NOTHING IS TO BE DONE TO GREEN I SHOULD SAY NOTHING ON THAT SCORE AND HE HAS GOT THEY SAY FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS CLEAR MONEY
I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE AT ANY RATE I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SOME EXCUSE FOR ME BUT I DO LIKE THE MAN HE IS GRACIOUS AND NOBLE IN HIS BEARING
THAN THE CLOSE AND BLIND DARKNESS OF SOME NARROW ROOM BUT IN PROPORTION AS THE BLACKNESS GATHERED DID THE LIGHTNINGS AROUND VESUVIUS INCREASE IN THEIR VIVID AND SCORCHING GLARE
ALREADY IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE MADE BUT A CIRCLE AND ARE IN THE VERY SPOT WHICH WE QUITTED AN HOUR AGO O GODS YON ROCK SEE IT HATH RIVEN THE ROOF BEFORE US IT IS DEATH TO MOVE THROUGH THE STREETS
WILD HAGGARD GHASTLY WITH SUPERNATURAL FEARS THESE GROUPS ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER BUT WITHOUT THE LEISURE TO SPEAK TO CONSULT TO ADVISE FOR THE SHOWERS FELL NOW FREQUENTLY THOUGH NOT CONTINUOUSLY
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN FRIENDSHIP THEN CERTAINLY I DO BUT THIS FRIENDSHIP IS SO UNEQUAL I CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT SHOULD HAVE GROWN FROM PERSONAL LIKING ON YOUR SIDE I THINK IT HAS
IT WAS EVIDENT SHE HAD BEEN SWEPT ALONG SOME OPPOSITE DIRECTION BY THE HUMAN CURRENT THEIR FRIEND THEIR PRESERVER WAS LOST AND HITHERTO NYDIA HAD BEEN THEIR GUIDE
NOW WHICH WAY COULD THEY WEND ALL WAS RAYLESS TO THEM A MAZE WITHOUT A CLUE WEARIED DESPONDENT BEWILDERED THEY HOWEVER PASSED ALONG THE ASHES FALLING UPON THEIR HEADS
THERE IS NO HUMAN BEING ALIVE MAJOR TIFTO WHOSE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE COULD BE A MATTER OF MORE INDIFFERENCE TO ME
I AM HEARTILY GLAD TO SEE YOU BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE COME HAD I BEEN TOLD AND WHEN I DID SEE YOU IT WAS QUITE IMPROBABLE THAT WE SHOULD BE THROWN TOGETHER AS WE ARE NOW WAS IT NOT AH HERE IS A MAN AND HE CAN TELL US THE WAY BACK TO COPPERHOUSE CROSS
TIFTO ACCEPTED THE GRATUITY AND ULTIMATELY BECAME AN ANNUAL PENSIONER ON HIS FORMER NOBLE PARTNER
FOR THE OCEAN HAD RETREATED RAPIDLY FROM THE SHORE AN UTTER DARKNESS LAY OVER IT AND UPON ITS GROANING AND TOSSING WAVES THE STORM OF CINDERS AND ROCK FELL WITHOUT THE PROTECTION WHICH THE STREETS AND ROOFS AFFORDED TO THE LAND
I AM SORRY FOR IT I CAN SAY NOTHING ELSE YOU AIN'T SO SORRY FOR IT AS I AM OH NO YOU CAN NEVER BE THAT MY LORD AFTER ALL WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO YOU
THAT THE DUKE TOOK TO COMING TO MY HOUSE THE DUKE SPOKEN OF WAS THE DUKE OF OMNIUM AND PHINEAS WELL REMEMBERED TO HAVE HEARD SOME RUMOURS ABOUT THE DUKE AND MADAME MAX IT HAD BEEN HINTED TO HIM THAT THE DUKE WANTED TO MARRY THE LADY
SO THAT IN POINT OF FACT THEY HAVE DRAWN TRUMPETON BUT THEY DIDN'T MEAN IT WHEN MADAME MAX GOESLER AND PHINEAS HAD REACHED HARRINGTON HALL THEY WERE ABLE TO GIVE THEIR OWN STORY OF THE DAY'S SPORT TO LADY CHILTERN
SAID MADAME GOESLER SLOWLY YOU SEE MISTER FINN THAT YOU AS A YOUNG MAN CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND HOW NATURAL IT IS THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IF I MAY CALL MYSELF YOUNG SHOULD MINISTER TO AN OLD MAN
HE DETERMINED THAT MARRIAGE CLIPS A FELLOW'S WINGS CONFOUNDEDLY AND SO HE SET HIMSELF TO ENJOY LIFE AFTER HIS OLD FASHION THERE WAS PERHAPS A LITTLE SWAGGER AS HE THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR AND ADDRESSED THE HAPPY LOVER
SOON AFTER THIS THEY WERE OVERTAKEN BY OTHERS WHO WERE RETURNING HOME AND WHO HAD BEEN MORE FORTUNATE THAN THEY IN GETTING AWAY WITH THE HOUNDS THE FOX HAD GONE STRAIGHT FOR TRUMPETON WOOD NOT DARING TO TRY THE GORSE ON THE WAY AND THEN HAD BEEN RUN TO GROUND
I GOT TO THINK THAT YOUR LORDSHIP WAS UPSETTING I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR LORDSHIP REMEMBERS BUT YOU DID PUT ME DOWN ONCE OR TWICE RATHER UNCOMMON I HOPE I WAS NOT UNJUST I DON'T SAY YOU WAS MY LORD
HE FELT THAT HE ALMOST OWED SOME REPARATION TO THE WRETCHED MAN WHOM HE HAD UNFORTUNATELY ADMITTED AMONG HIS FRIENDS WHOM HE HAD USED AND TO WHOM HE HAD BEEN UNCOURTEOUS EXACTLY AT THE HOUR NAMED THE MAJOR WAS SHOWN INTO HIS ROOM
BUT SEEMED TO BE THOROUGHLY HUMILIATED I DON'T THINK I CAN BE OF ANY SERVICE TO YOU AND THEREFORE I HAD RATHER DECLINE I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE OF ANY SERVICE MY LORD THEN WHAT'S THE GOOD
READ TO HIM TALK TO HIM GIVE HIM HIS FOOD AND DO ALL THAT IN ME LIES TO MAKE HIS LIFE BEARABLE LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS THOUGHT NECESSARY THAT VERY DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENTERTAINED AT THE GREAT FAMILY CASTLE
OR PARENT FROM CHILD VAIN WAS THE HOPE OF REUNION EACH HURRIED BLINDLY AND CONFUSEDLY ON NOTHING IN ALL THE VARIOUS AND COMPLICATED MACHINERY OF SOCIAL LIFE WAS LEFT
IT IS A PITY BUT IT CANNOT BE HELPED I WILL HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO DO WITH IT OF COURSE I CANNOT BIND YOU BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU MY WISHES THE POOR WRETCH WAS SILENT BUT STILL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE DID NOT WISH TO GO QUITE YET
FROM THE LIGHTNING AND THE SHOWERS THE BEAUTY AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF LOVE COULD HALLOW EVEN THAT DISMAL TIME WHO IS THERE SAID THE TREMBLING AND HOLLOW VOICE OF ONE WHO HAD PRECEDED THEM
PERHAPS HE DID NOT TAKE MUCH DELIGHT IN THEM HE WAS NO DOUBT IMPATIENT TO COMMENCE THAT STEADY MARRIED LIFE FOR WHICH HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF BUT NEVERTHELESS JUST AT PRESENT HE LIVED A GOOD DEAL AT THE BEARGARDEN WHERE WAS HE TO LIVE THE BONCASSENS WERE IN PARIS
AN OLD MAN WITH A BAG IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND LEANING UPON A YOUTH TOTTERED BY THE YOUTH BORE A TORCH GLAUCUS RECOGNIZED THE TWO AS FATHER AND SON MISER AND PRODIGAL FATHER SAID THE YOUTH
EXTINGUISHING THE LIGHTS WHICH SHOWED TO EACH BAND THE DEATHLIKE FACES OF THE OTHER AND HURRYING ALL TO SEEK REFUGE BENEATH THE NEAREST SHELTER THE WHOLE ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION WERE BROKEN UP EVER AND ANON
BUT YOU'LL BE AT MATCHING I DO GET A FEW DAYS AT HOME SOMETIMES YOU SEE I HAVE ESCAPED FOR THE PRESENT OR OTHERWISE YOU AND I WOULD NOT HAVE COME TO GRIEF TOGETHER IN BROUGHTON SPINNIES
THE PORTICO OF THE TEMPLE OF FORTUNE IS BEFORE US LET US CREEP BENEATH IT IT WILL PROTECT US FROM THE SHOWERS HE CAUGHT HIS BELOVED IN HIS ARMS AND WITH DIFFICULTY AND LABOR GAINED THE TEMPLE
WHY SHOULD YOU SUBJECT YOURSELF TO SUCH INDIGNITY SIMPLY FROM LOVE OF THE MAN BUT YOU SEE I WAS NOT SUBJECTED FOR TWO DAYS I WORE MY JEWELS BENEATH ROYAL EYES EYES THAT WILL SOONER OR LATER BELONG TO ABSOLUTE MAJESTY
WOE TO YE OF THE FASCES AND THE PURPLE WOE TO THE IDOLATER AND THE WORSHIPPER OF THE BEAST WOE TO YE WHO POUR FORTH THE BLOOD OF SAINTS AND GLOAT OVER THE DEATH PANGS OF THE SONS OF GOD WOE TO THE HARLOT OF THE SEA
GUSHING FORTH THROUGH THE COLUMNS OF SMOKE FAR AND WIDE AND LIGHTING UP THE WHOLE CITY FROM ARCH TO ARCH THEN SUDDENLY DYING INTO A SICKLY PALENESS LIKE THE GHOST OF THEIR OWN LIFE
THE GRINDING AND HISSING MURMUR OF THE ESCAPING GASES THROUGH THE CHASMS OF THE DISTANT MOUNTAIN SOMETIMES THE CLOUD APPEARED TO BREAK FROM ITS SOLID MASS AND BY THE LIGHTNING TO ASSUME QUAINT AND VAST MIMICRIES OF HUMAN
NOW OF A LIVID AND SNAKELIKE GREEN DARTING RESTLESSLY TO AND FRO AS THE FOLDS OF AN ENORMOUS SERPENT
IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT DOLLY HAD DECLARED HIS PURPOSE OF EMIGRATING AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT THE DUKE'S HEIR HAD SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF MARRYING THE LADY WHOM HE LOVED HE WITHDREW AT ONCE FROM THE CONTEST
HE IS NOW VERY OLD AND SINKING FAST INTO THE GRAVE BUT EVEN THE WRECK IS NOBLE I DON'T KNOW THAT HE EVER DID MUCH SAID PHINEAS I DON'T KNOW THAT HE EVER DID ANYTHING ACCORDING TO YOUR IDEA OF DOING
THERE MUST BE SOME MEN WHO DO NOTHING BUT A MAN WITH HIS WEALTH AND RANK HAS OPPORTUNITIES SO GREAT LOOK AT HIS NEPHEW NO DOUBT MISTER PALLISER IS A GREAT MAN
IT IS BETTER SO FOR OTHERWISE I SHOULD NOT HAVE COME AND THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL ALONE IN YOUR DISCOMFITURE AT THE BANK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY BAD YOU SEE I CAN BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU MISTER FINN
BY THE FLICKERING LIGHTS YOU SAW THE THIEF HASTENING BY THE MOST SOLEMN AUTHORITIES OF THE LAW LADEN WITH AND FEARFULLY CHUCKLING OVER THE PRODUCE OF HIS SUDDEN GAINS IF IN THE DARKNESS WIFE WAS SEPARATED FROM HUSBAND
WE WAS VERY MUCH TOGETHER AT ONE TIME MY LORD YES MAJOR TIFTO WE WERE OF COURSE I WAS A VILLAIN BUT IT WAS ONLY ONCE AND YOUR LORDSHIP WAS SO ROUGH TO ME I AM NOT SAYING BUT WHAT I WAS A VILLAIN
AND WHEN HE HAD PASSED THROUGH THE FIRST STREET AND HAD GOT INTO THE HAYMARKET THERE HE WAS THE MAJOR CAME UP TO HIM TOUCHED HIS HAT ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO SAY A FEW WORDS I DON'T THINK IT CAN DO ANY GOOD SAID SILVERBRIDGE
I CERTAINLY DID NOT THINK THAT WE SHOULD MEET AGAIN SO SOON NO I LEFT YOU AS THOUGH I HAD GROUNDS FOR QUARRELLING BUT THERE WAS NO QUARREL I WROTE TO YOU AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT YOU DID
CHILTERN WAS AGAIN IN A TOWERING PASSION AS THE EARTHS HE SAID HAD BEEN PURPOSELY LEFT OPEN BUT ON THIS MATTER THE MEN WHO HAD OVERTAKEN OUR FRIENDS WERE BOTH OF OPINION THAT CHILTERN WAS WRONG HE HAD ALLOWED IT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WOULD NOT DRAW TRUMPETON WOOD
TO ADD TO THIS PARTIAL RELIEF OF THE DARKNESS THE CITIZENS HAD HERE AND THERE IN THE MORE PUBLIC PLACES SUCH AS THE PORTICOES OF TEMPLES AND THE ENTRANCES TO THE FORUM ENDEAVORED TO PLACE ROWS OF TORCHES
GLAUCUS SHOUTED HER NAME NO ANSWER CAME THEY RETRACED THEIR STEPS IN VAIN THEY COULD NOT DISCOVER HER
BUT WHEN THERE CAME A QUESTION OF THE ENTERTAINMENT OF ROYALTY I FOUND MYSELF REDUCED TO BLIND OBEDIENCE I HAD TO GO TO GATHERUM CASTLE TO THE ABSOLUTE NEGLECT OF MY BUSINESS AND I WENT DO YOU STILL KEEP IT UP OH DEAR YES
BUT AS HE DID SO HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE COULD BE NO LONGER A HOME FOR HIM IN THE COUNTRY WHICH ISABEL WAS TO INHABIT AS THE WIFE OF ANOTHER MAN GRADUALLY HOWEVER BETTER THOUGHTS RETURNED TO HIM AFTER ALL WHAT WAS SHE BUT A PERT POPPET
BUT CERTAINLY THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY DO YOU TELL YOUR FRIEND LORD CHILTERN NOT TO ABUSE THE POOR DUKE ANY MORE BEFORE ME I DARE SAY OUR HOST IS ALL RIGHT IN WHAT HE SAYS BUT I DON'T LIKE IT YOU'LL COME AND SEE ME IN LONDON MISTER FINN
THE LESSON OF DESPAIR FREQUENTLY BY THE MOMENTARY LIGHT OF THESE TORCHES PARTIES OF FUGITIVES ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER SOME HURRYING TOWARDS THE SEA OTHERS FLYING FROM THE SEA BACK TO THE LAND
PERHAPS THE DAY MAY ARRIVE IN WHICH THEY SHALL BE CODIFIED UNDER THE CARE OF SOME GREAT AND LABORIOUS MASTER OF HOUNDS AND THEY DID NOTHING MORE ASKED PHINEAS YES THEY CHOPPED ANOTHER FOX BEFORE THEY LEFT THE PLACE
ONLY THAT YOU ASK ME I DO ASK YOU AND YOU ARE QUITE WELCOME TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINION AND WERE IT NOT EXPRESSED I SHOULD KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT JUST THE SAME I HAVE WONDERED AT IT MYSELF SOMETIMES
WILL NEVER RECEIVE A TITHE OF THE RESPECT THAT HAS BEEN PAID TO THIS OLD FAINEANT BUT HE WILL ACHIEVE MUCH MORE THAN TEN TIMES THE REPUTATION SAID PHINEAS I WON'T COMPARE THEM NOR WILL I ARGUE BUT I LIKE THE DUKE
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN SHOW YOUR GRATITUDE HOLD YOUR TONGUE ABOUT IT LET IT BE AS A THING DONE AND GONE THE MONEY HAS BEEN PAID THE HORSE HAS BEEN SOLD
THE DARKNESS WAS NOW TERRIBLY RELIEVED FOR SEVERAL HOUSES AND EVEN VINEYARDS HAD BEEN SET ON FLAMES AND AT VARIOUS INTERVALS THE FIRES ROSE SUDDENLY AND FIERCELY AGAINST THE SOLID GLOOM
BEHOLD THE LORD DESCENDETH TO JUDGMENT HE MAKETH FIRE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IN THE SIGHT OF MEN
HE IS AT MATCHING NOW AND I DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL EVER LEAVE IT AGAIN I SHALL GO THERE FROM HERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND RELIEVE GUARD WITH LADY GLENCORA I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU GET FOR IT ALL GET WHAT SHOULD I GET
LET ME SEE WE ARE TO TURN HERE TO THE LEFT THAT GOES TO COPPERHOUSE CROSS NO DOUBT IS IT NOT ODD THAT I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THIS HISTORY JUST BECAUSE THIS BRUTE WOULD NOT JUMP OVER THE FENCE I DARE SAY I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU EVEN IF HE HAD JUMPED OVER
BUT THAT RUMOUR HE HAD NEVER BELIEVED THE READER IF HE HAS DULY STUDIED THE HISTORY OF THE AGE WILL KNOW THAT THE DUKE DID MAKE AN OFFER TO MADAME GOESLER PRESSING IT WITH ALL HIS ELOQUENCE
AND THE GLADIATOR DID NOT RECEDE OR TREMBLE THE REVOLUTION OF NATURE HAD DISSOLVED HER LIGHTER TERRORS AS WELL AS HER WONTED TIES WHILE THEY WERE THUS TERRIBLY PROTECTED
THE UNSUBSTANTIAL VAPORS WERE AS THE BODILY FORMS OF GIGANTIC FOES THE AGENTS OF TERROR AND OF DEATH THE ASHES IN MANY PLACES WERE ALREADY KNEE DEEP AND THE BOILING SHOWERS WHICH CAME FROM THE STEAMING BREATH OF THE VOLCANO
OH OF COURSE IT MUST LAST THE DUKE'S TIME AND LAST NO LONGER IT WOULD NOT BE A HEALTHY KIND OF LIFE WERE IT NOT THAT I DO MY VERY BEST TO MAKE THE EVENING OF HIS DAYS PLEASANT FOR HIM
THAT LIGHTNING HAD REVEALED TO EACH OTHER THE FORM OF BEAST AND MAN YET THE INSTINCT OF BOTH WAS QUELLED NAY THE LION CREPT NEARER AND NEARER TO THE GLADIATOR AS FOR COMPANIONSHIP
AND A SUBLIME AND UNEARTHLY EMOTION HAD NOT INDEED QUELLED THEIR AWE BUT IT HAD ROBBED AWE OF FEAR THEY HAD LONG BELIEVED ACCORDING TO THE ERROR OF THE EARLY CHRISTIANS THAT THE LAST DAY WAS AT HAND
BUT I GOT A FEELING ON ME THAT YOU WANTED TO GET RID OF ME AND I ALL THE TIME DOING THE BEST I COULD FOR THE ORSES I DID DO THE BEST I COULD UP TO THAT VERY MORNING AT DONCASTER WELL IT WAS GREEN PUT ME UP TO IT
THAT I SHOULD HAVE BECOME AS IT WERE ENGULFED IN THIS NEW LIFE ALMOST WITHOUT WILL OF MY OWN AND WHEN HE DIES HOW SHALL I RETURN TO THE OTHER LIFE
IONE TURNED AT THE SOUND OF THE VOICE AND WITH A FAINT SHRIEK COWERED AGAIN BENEATH THE ARMS OF GLAUCUS AND HE LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOICE BEHELD THE CAUSE OF HER ALARM
MASTER OF HOUNDS MEMBER OF THE CLUB
AND IS ALWAYS THINKING SO MUCH ABOUT THE COUNTRY THAT I DOUBT IF HE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT HIS OWN AFFAIRS OF COURSE HE IS A MAN OF A DIFFERENT STAMP AND OF A HIGHER STAMP IF YOU WILL BUT I HAVE AN IDEA THAT SUCH CHARACTERS AS THOSE OF THE PRESENT DUKE
LADY GLENCORA AT SUCH A TIME WOULD HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO AND I MUST BE THERE OR GATHERUM CASTLE SHOULD NOT BE OPENED I SUGGESTED WHETHER I COULD NOT REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND AND LOOK AFTER THE DUKE AS A KIND OF UPPER NURSE BUT LADY GLENCORA SAID IT WOULD NOT DO
BUT THEY RESOLVED TO ABANDON THAT AND TO RIDE DIRECT TO HARRINGTON HALL IT WAS NOW NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK AND THEY WOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE SHAME WHICH FALLS UPON SPORTSMEN WHO ARE SEEN RIDING HOME VERY EARLY IN THE DAY
AND IN SPITE OF HIS JEWELLERY THERE WAS A HANG DOG LOOK ABOUT HIM I'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT I PARTICULARLY WANT TO SAY TO YOU MY LORD SILVERBRIDGE WOULD NOT SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM BUT COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM OFFERING HIM A CHAIR WELL
HE WAS TRUE TO ME TILL HE THOUGHT I SNUBBED HIM I WOULD NOT LET HIM GO DOWN TO SILVERBRIDGE WITH ME I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I DROVE THE POOR MAJOR TO HIS MALPRACTICES AT THIS MOMENT DOLLY LONGSTAFF SAUNTERED INTO THE ROOM AND CAME UP TO THEM
IN BARSETSHIRE YOU KNOW I HAVE HEARD OF THE PLACE A REGULAR TREATY OR AGREEMENT WAS DRAWN UP CONDITIONS WERE SEALED AND SIGNED ONE CONDITION WAS THAT BOTH LADY GLENCORA AND I SHOULD BE THERE
I CAME THEN TO CONFESS IT ALL BEFORE IT WAS DONE THEN WHY COULDN'T YOU LET THE HORSE ALONE I WAS IN THEIR HANDS AND THEN YOU WAS SO ROUGH WITH ME SO I SAID TO MYSELF I MIGHT AS WELL DO IT
SAVE THE PRIMAL LAW OF SELF PRESERVATION THROUGH THIS AWFUL SCENE DID THE ATHENIAN WADE HIS WAY ACCOMPANIED BY IONE AND THE BLIND GIRL SUDDENLY A RUSH OF HUNDREDS IN THEIR PATH TO THE SEA SWEPT BY THEM
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT IT HERE AND FEEL IT AS I DO
BELOVED FLY AND LEAVE ME TO MY FATE HUSH MY BETROTHED MY BRIDE DEATH WITH THEE IS SWEETER THAN LIFE WITHOUT THEE YET WHITHER OH WHITHER CAN WE DIRECT OURSELVES THROUGH THE GLOOM
WRETCH WOULDST THOU ROB THY FATHER AY WHO CAN TELL THE TALE IN THIS HOUR MISER PERISH THE BOY STRUCK THE OLD MAN TO THE GROUND PLUCKED THE BAG FROM HIS RELAXING HAND
DOLLY HAD SAID THAT HE WAS SHABBY BUT THE MAN WAS ALTERED RATHER THAN SHABBY HE STILL HAD RINGS ON HIS FINGERS AND STUDS IN HIS SHIRT AND A JEWELLED PIN IN HIS CRAVAT BUT HE HAD SHAVEN OFF HIS MOUSTACHE AND THE TUFT FROM HIS CHIN
WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER TO TRY TO AVOID THIS AS OF COURSE THE PRINCE WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE ME PARTICULARLY AND IT WAS ALTOGETHER SO GRAND AN AFFAIR THAT THINGS HAD TO BE WEIGHED BUT THE DUKE WAS INEXORABLE
NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID ABOUT THE MAN BUT SILVERBRIDGE WAS UNEASY AND SILENT WHEN HIS CIGAR WAS FINISHED HE GOT UP SAYING THAT HE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE HOUSE AS HE LEFT THE CLUB HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AS THOUGH EXPECTING TO SEE HIS OLD FRIEND
I REMEMBER IT WELL I WAS THERE AND FIRST MADE THE DUKE'S ACQUAINTANCE ON THAT OCCASION I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS THAT WE BECAME INTIMATE BUT WE DID AND THEN I FORMED A SORT OF FRIENDSHIP WITH LADY GLENCORA
THE FRAGMENTARY STONES DASHING UP IN SPARKLES BEFORE THEIR FEET ALAS ALAS MURMURED IONE I CAN GO NO FARTHER MY STEPS SINK AMONG THE SCORCHING CINDERS FLY DEAREST
AND TO BE RETURNING AFTER AN EXCELLENT DAY'S WORK THEN MADAME GOESLER BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HERSELF AND TO GIVE A SHORT HISTORY OF HER LIFE DURING THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS SHE DID THIS IN A FRANK NATURAL MANNER
HOW WILL IT BE WHEN HE HAS GONE AH HOW INDEED LADY GLENCORA AND I WILL HAVE TO CURTSEY TO EACH OTHER AND THERE WILL BE AN END OF IT SHE WILL BE A DUCHESS THEN AND I SHALL NO LONGER BE WANTED BUT EVEN IF YOU WERE WANTED
ARE NECESSARY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF A GREAT ARISTOCRACY HE HAS HAD THE POWER OF MAKING THE WORLD BELIEVE IN HIM SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN RICH AND A DUKE HIS NEPHEW WHEN HE COMES TO THE TITLE
UNWITTING OF THE VICINITY LAY THE GIANT FORM OF HIM WHO HAD ACCOSTED THEM THE WOUNDED GLADIATOR
AND THOUGH MY ANSWER WAS NECESSARILY SHORT I WAS VERY GRATEFUL AND HERE YOU ARE BACK AMONG US AND IT DOES SEEM SO ODD LADY CHILTERN NEVER TOLD ME THAT I WAS TO MEET YOU NOR DID SHE TELL ME
BUT THESE RARELY CONTINUED LONG THE SHOWERS AND THE WINDS EXTINGUISHED THEM AND THE SUDDEN DARKNESS INTO WHICH THEIR SUDDEN BIRTH WAS CONVERTED HAD SOMETHING IN IT DOUBLY TERRIBLE AND DOUBLY IMPRESSING ON THE IMPOTENCE OF HUMAN HOPES
SINCE THE BUSINESS HAD BEEN COMPLETED SHE HAD SPOKEN OF IT TO NO ONE BUT TO LADY GLENCORA PALLISER WHO HAD FORCED HERSELF INTO A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHILE THEY WERE BEING ACTED I MET THE DUKE ONCE AT MATCHING SAID PHINEAS
NOR WAS THEIR HORRIBLE BEAUTY CONFINED TO THE USUAL HUES OF FIRE NO RAINBOW EVER RIVALLED THEIR VARYING AND PRODIGAL DYES NOW BRIGHTLY BLUE AS THE MOST AZURE DEPTH OF A SOUTHERN SKY
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY MAY I COME TO YOU TO MORROW THEN SILVERBRIDGE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND AN HOUR WAS NAMED AT WHICH TIFTO MIGHT CALL IN CARLTON TERRACE
THEY IMAGINED NOW THAT THE DAY HAD COME
AND THE SILENCE OF DEATH AGAIN FELL OVER THE SCENE THERE WAS ONE OF THE FREQUENT PAUSES IN THE SHOWERS AND GLAUCUS ENCOURAGED IONE ONCE MORE TO PROCEED JUST AS THEY STOOD HESITATING ON THE LAST STEP OF THE PORTICO
LOOK HERE MAJOR TIFTO YOU HAVE COME HERE TO CONFESS THAT YOU HAVE DONE ME A GREAT INJURY YES I HAVE AND YOU SAY YOU ARE SORRY FOR IT INDEED I AM AND I HAVE FORGIVEN YOU
I AIN'T SAID IT ALL YET HE'S HERE IN LONDON WHO'S HERE GREEN HE'S HERE HE DOESN'T THINK THAT I KNOW BUT I COULD LAY MY HAND ON HIM TO MORROW
I AM IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND LORD SILVERBRIDGE THAT IT WOULD BE A SATISFACTION TO TELL IT ALL EVEN AGAINST MYSELF I CAN'T PREVENT YOU THEN TIFTO GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AS THOUGH HE WERE GOING
YOU ASK ME WHY I DID IT THE FACT IS THAT THINGS SOMETIMES BECOME TOO STRONG FOR ONE EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO REAL POWER OF CONSTRAINT FOR YEARS PAST I HAVE BEEN USED TO HAVE MY OWN WAY
IF YOU HAVE SAID WHAT YOU HAVE GOT TO SAY MAJOR TIFTO I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU THAT MY TIME IS ENGAGED AND MUST THAT BE ALL WHAT ELSE
HER BLINDNESS RENDERED THE SCENE FAMILIAR TO HER ALONE ACCUSTOMED THROUGH A PERPETUAL NIGHT TO THREAD THE WINDINGS OF THE CITY SHE HAD LED THEM UNERRINGLY TOWARDS THE SEA SHORE BY WHICH THEY HAD RESOLVED TO HAZARD AN ESCAPE
OR OF MONSTER SHAPES STRIDING ACROSS THE GLOOM HURTLING ONE UPON THE OTHER AND VANISHING SWIFTLY INTO THE TURBULENT ABYSS OF SHADE
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN MADAME GOESLER'S STORY AFTER ALL THAT HAS COME AND GONE IS IT NOT ODD THAT YOU AND I SHOULD FIND OURSELVES RIDING ABOUT BROUGHTON SPINNIES TOGETHER
AND I DID IT WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY AS FAR AS MY FORGIVENESS GOES YOU HAVE IT THAT'S SAYING A GREAT DEAL MY LORD A GREAT DEAL SAID TIFTO NOW IN TEARS BUT
BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME BOND TO THE OLD MAN THERE IS A BOND YOU MUST NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME SAID PHINEAS I AM NOT IN THE LEAST ANGRY I SHOULD NOT VENTURE TO EXPRESS ANY OPINION OF COURSE
AND FLED ONWARD WITH A SHRILL YELL
WHICH YET MORE AND MORE WITH EVERY HOUR OBSTRUCTED THE WAY AND AS THE DAY ADVANCED THE MOTION OF THE EARTH WAS MORE SENSIBLY FELT THE FOOTING SEEMED TO SLIDE AND CREEP NOR COULD CHARIOT OR LITTER BE KEPT STEADY EVEN ON THE MOST LEVEL GROUND
CONTINUING HER TALE IN A LOW VOICE AS THOUGH IT WERE ALMOST A MATTER OF COURSE THAT SHE SHOULD MAKE THE RECITAL TO SO OLD A FRIEND AND PHINEAS SOON BEGAN TO FEEL THAT IT WAS NATURAL THAT SHE SHOULD DO SO IT WAS JUST BEFORE YOU LEFT US SHE SAID
HIS SISTER WAS AT MATCHING WITH A HOUSEFUL OF OTHER PALLISERS AND HIS FATHER WAS AGAIN DEEP IN POLITICS OF COURSE HE WAS MUCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BUT THAT ALSO WAS STUPID INDEED EVERYTHING WOULD BE STUPID TILL ISABEL CAME BACK
TO GET ONESELF LOST BEFORE TWELVE AND THEN TO COME HOME IS A VERY DEGRADING THING
VERY LITTLE I MEANT THAT I WAS SORRY FOR YOUR SAKE I BELIEVE YOU ARE MY LORD FOR THOUGH YOU COULD BE ROUGH YOU WAS ALWAYS KIND NOW I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING AND THEN YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE
HE WROTE TO ME AND I ANSWERED HIM AS YOU KNOW BUT WHITHER HE VANISHED OR WHAT HE IS DOING OR HOW HE IS LIVING I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA GONE TO JOIN THOSE OTHER FELLOWS ABROAD I SHOULD SAY
I WISH TO DO NOTHING AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THE MATTER IS OVER IT MADE ME SICK OF HORSES AND I DO NOT WISH TO HAVE TO THINK OF IT AGAIN NEVERTHELESS MY LORD I'VE GOT TO TELL IT IT WAS GREEN WHO PUT ME UP TO IT
THE NAZARENES PACED SLOWLY ON THEIR TORCHES STILL FLICKERING IN THE STORM THEIR VOICES STILL RAISED IN MENACE AND SOLEMN WARNING TILL LOST AMID THE WINDINGS IN THE STREETS THE DARKNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE
THE PROGRESS OF THE DESTRUCTION THE CLOUD WHICH HAD SCATTERED SO DEEP A MURKINESS OVER THE DAY HAD NOW SETTLED INTO A SOLID AND IMPENETRABLE MASS IT RESEMBLED LESS EVEN THE THICKEST GLOOM OF A NIGHT IN THE OPEN AIR
NYDIA WAS TORN FROM THE SIDE OF GLAUCUS WHO WITH IONE WAS BORNE RAPIDLY ONWARD AND WHEN THE CROWD WHOSE FORMS THEY SAW NOT SO THICK WAS THE GLOOM WERE GONE NYDIA WAS STILL SEPARATED FROM THEIR SIDE
AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT THE EARTHS SHOULD BE STOPPED BUT THERE WERE AND HAD BEEN VARIOUS OPINIONS ON THIS DIFFICULT POINT AS THE LAWS OF HUNTING ARE COMPLEX RECONDITE NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND NOT ALWAYS PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD
A SHABBY HAT AND OLD GLOVES DID HE SPEAK TO YOU ASKED SILVERBRIDGE NO NOR I TO HIM
HE BORE HER TO THE REMOTER AND MORE SHELTERED PART OF THE PORTICO
I DON'T SAY I WAS TO GET NOTHING BUT IT WASN'T SO MUCH MORE THAN I COULD HAVE GOT BY THE ORSE WINNING AND I'VE LOST PRETTY NEARLY ALL THAT I DID GET DO YOU REMEMBER MY LORD AND NOW THE MAJOR SANK HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER
I SUPPOSE YOU LIKE LADY GLENCORA VERY MUCH INDEED AND THE DUKE TOO THE TRUTH IS MISTER FINN THAT LET ONE BOAST AS ONE MAY OF ONE'S INDEPENDENCE AND I VERY OFTEN DO BOAST OF MINE TO MYSELF
I'LL GO BEFORE ANY JUDGE OR MAGISTRATE OR POLICE OFFICER IN THE COUNTRY AND TELL THE TRUTH
THIS PUT HIS HAND UPON HIS HEART YOU CAN'T SLEEP IN YOUR BED TILL IT'S OUT I DID THAT THING THAT THEY SAID I DID WHAT THING WHY THE NAIL IT WAS I LAMED THE HORSE
FORCED THEIR WAY INTO THE HOUSES BEARING WITH THEM A STRONG AND SUFFOCATING VAPOR IN SOME PLACES IMMENSE FRAGMENTS OF ROCK HURLED UPON THE HOUSE ROOFS BORE DOWN ALONG THE STREETS MASSES OF CONFUSED RUIN
THROUGH THE DARKNESS GLARED FORTH TWO BURNING EYES THE LIGHTNING FLASHED AND LINGERED ATHWART THE TEMPLE AND GLAUCUS WITH A SHUDDER PERCEIVED THE LION TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN DOOMED COUCHED BENEATH THE PILLARS AND CLOSE BESIDE IT
PERHAPS DINNER WAS MORE COMFORTABLE AT THE CLUB THAN AT THE HOUSE AND THEN AS EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS A GOOD THING TO CHANGE THE SCENE THEREFORE HE DINED AT THE CLUB
A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN BEARING TORCHES PASSED BY THE TEMPLE
HE SPENT MANY LONG HOURS AT THE BEARGARDEN THERE'LL VERY SOON BE AN END OF THIS AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED
SOMETIMES THE HUGER STONES STRIKING AGAINST EACH OTHER AS THEY FELL BROKE INTO COUNTLESS FRAGMENTS EMITTING SPARKS OF FIRE WHICH CAUGHT WHATEVER WAS COMBUSTIBLE WITHIN THEIR REACH AND ALONG THE PLAINS BEYOND THE CITY
FOR THE LEFT ARM FIVE HUNDRED PIECES OF EIGHT OR FIVE SLAVES FOR A RIGHT LEG FIVE HUNDRED PIECES OF EIGHT OR FIVE SLAVES FOR THE LEFT LEG FOUR HUNDRED PIECES OF EIGHT OR FOUR SLAVES FOR AN EYE ONE HUNDRED PIECES OF EIGHT OR ONE SLAVE
THEY ALL PUT THEMSELVES INTO CANOES AND ENTERED THE RIVER BEING FIVE HUNDRED MEN LEAVING ONLY FIVE OR SIX PERSONS IN EACH SHIP TO KEEP THEM THEY TOOK NO PROVISIONS BEING PERSUADED THEY SHOULD FIND EVERYWHERE SUFFICIENT BUT THESE THEIR HOPES WERE FOUND TOTALLY VAIN NOT BEING GROUNDED ON ALMIGHTY GOD
TO WHAT THE ORDINARY SEAMEN HAVE THE MASTER'S MATE ONLY TWO AND OTHER OFFICERS PROPORTIONATELY TO THEIR EMPLOY AFTER WHICH
BUT AT JAMAICA THEY OUGHT NOT TO RUN VERY DEEP IN DEBT SEEING THE INHABITANTS THERE EASILY SELL ONE ANOTHER FOR DEBT
WAITING FOR THE RETURN OF THEM WHO GOT AWAY ONLY TO THEIR GREAT MISFORTUNE HEARING NO NEWS OF THEIR CAPTAIN NOR COMPANIONS AT LAST EMBARKED ON THE SHIP OF A CERTAIN PIRATE WHO HAPPENED TO PASS THAT WAY
IF HE SHOULD PUNISH THEM HEREUPON HE RELEASED THEM EXACTING ONLY AN OATH ON THEM
BUT ESPECIALLY ABUSING THE POOR SPANIARDS WHO FELL INTO THEIR HANDS WITH ALL SORTS OF CRUELTY THE SPANIARDS FINDING THEY COULD GAIN NOTHING ON THESE PEOPLE NOR DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER DAILY RESOLVED TO LESSEN THE NUMBER OF THEIR TRADING SHIPS BUT NEITHER WAS THIS OF ANY SERVICE
AFTER HAVING SPENT ALL WAS FORCED TO GO TO SEA AGAIN TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE HE SET FORTH TOWARDS THE COAST OF CAMPECHY HIS COMMON RENDEZVOUS FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL
NOT TO CONCEAL THE LEAST THING THEY FIND AMONG THE PRIZES AND IF ANY ONE IS FOUND FALSE TO THE SAID OATH HE IS IMMEDIATELY TURNED OUT OF THE SOCIETY THEY ARE VERY CIVIL AND CHARITABLE TO EACH OTHER SO THAT IF ANY ONE WANTS WHAT ANOTHER HAS
YOU KNOW IT'S A SHAME THAT GEEK MESSIAH ISN'T A SMART CROOK INSTEAD OF AN HONEST FANATIC HE COULD TAKE IN THE EQUIVALENT OF A COUPLE OF MILLION SOLS A YEAR OFF THE NORTH ULLER MERCHANTS AND THE EQUATORIAL ZONE SHIPOWNERS BUT IT IS A FACT WHICH NOT EVEN RAKKEED CAN SUCCESSFULLY DENY
THE SHEATHS OF THEIR SWORDS KNIVES AND OTHER SUCH THINGS BEING ALMOST RAVENOUS AND EAGER TO MEET SOME INDIANS
THE PIRATES GAINING IN THIS ADVENTURE BUT SEVEN OR EIGHT POUNDS WEIGHT OF GOLD THEY RETURNED GIVING OVER THE DESIGN TO GO TO THE TOWN OF NATA SITUATE ON THE COASTS OF THE SOUTH SEA
THE KRAGANS ARE THE ONLY REAL FRIENDS WE HAVE ON THIS PLANET HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
THEY CAN MANIPULATE MORE CONTROLS AND DO MORE THINGS AT ONCE THAN WE CAN HERE ON ULLER AT THE POLAR MINES
BEING ALL COME ABOARD THEY CONSIDER WHERE TO GET PROVISIONS ESPECIALLY FLESH SEEING THEY SCARCE EAT ANYTHING ELSE AND OF THIS THE MOST COMMON SORT IS PORK THE NEXT FOOD IS TORTOISES WHICH THEY SALT A LITTLE
WHICH HE HAD CERTAINLY CARRIED OFF IF HIS MAIN MAST HAD NOT BEEN LOST AS WE SAID BEFORE ANOTHER BOLD ATTEMPT LIKE THIS NO LESS REMARKABLE I SHALL ALSO GIVE YOU
BUT THE MEDICS WERE NOT GREATLY DISTURBED AND EXPECTED HIM TO BE FULLY RECOVERED IN A FEW WEEKS VON SCHLICHTEN INVITED HER AND HER ESCORT TO JOIN HIM AND BLOUNT COLONEL O'LEARY WAS CARRYING A COCKTAIL JUG AND A COUPLE OF GLASSES FINDING A TABLE OUT OF THE WORST OF THE NOISE
HIS OWN NAME NOT BEING KNOWN
WHENCE THEY GATHER ABUNDANCE OF FRUITS AS POTATOES BANANAS RACOVEN ANANAS AND MANY OTHERS THEY HAVE NO HOUSES TO DWELL IN AS AT OTHER PLACES IN THE INDIES SOME SAY THEY EAT HUMAN FLESH WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN LOLONOIS WAS THERE
WHERE HE ARRIVED WITHIN A FORTNIGHT AFTER HIS ESCAPE DURING WHICH TIME AS ALSO AFTERWARDS HE ENDURED EXTREME HUNGER AND THIRST HAVING NO OTHER PROVISION WITH HIM THAN A SMALL CALABACA WITH A LITTLE WATER BESIDES THE FEARS OF FALLING AGAIN INTO THE HANDS OF THE SPANIARDS
WHEN WE CAME TO ULLER WE FOUND A CULTURE ROUGHLY LIKE THAT OF EUROPE DURING THE SEVENTH CENTURY PRE ATOMIC OR MORE CLOSELY LIKE THAT OF JAPAN BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST CENTURY P A WE INITIATED A TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC REVOLUTION HERE
HERE THEY SET DOWN DISTINCTLY WHAT SUMS OF MONEY EACH PARTICULAR PERSON OUGHT TO HAVE FOR THAT VOYAGE THE FUND OF ALL THE PAYMENTS BEING WHAT IS GOTTEN BY THE WHOLE EXPEDITION FOR OTHERWISE IT IS THE SAME LAW AMONG THESE PEOPLE AS WITH OTHER PIRATES NO PREY NO PAY
THEM LIKE KNIVES THOUGH NOT SO WELL
THIS MAN HAD WITHIN THREE MONTHS BEFORE THREE THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT IN READY CASH ALL WHICH HE WASTED IN THAT LITTLE TIME AND BECAME AS POOR AS I HAVE TOLD YOU
THEY COMMONLY UNDERTAKE SOME MORE HAZARDOUS ENTERPRISES ONE REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF WHICH I SHALL HERE GIVE YOU A CERTAIN PIRATE CALLED PIERRE FRANCOIS OR PETER FRANCIS WAITING A LONG TIME AT SEA WITH HIS BOAT AND TWENTY SIX MEN
YET SEEING THEIR BRAVE COMMANDER OPPOSE THE ENEMY WITH SUCH COURAGE RESOLVED TO DO THE LIKE HEREUPON THEY FACED THE TROOP OF SPANIARDS AND DISCHARGED THEIR MUSKETS ON THEM SO DEXTROUSLY THAT THEY KILLED ONE HORSEMAN ALMOST WITH EVERY SHOT
ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS GAVE ME AN EXACT ACCOUNT OF THIS TRAGEDY AFFIRMING THAT HIMSELF HAD ESCAPED THE SAME PUNISHMENT WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY
HE RESOLVED TO ATTEMPT THE MAN OF WAR WITH WHICH ADDITION HE HOPED TO MASTER THE REST OF THE FLEET TO THIS END HE PRESENTLY SUNK HIS OWN BOAT PUTTING FORTH THE SPANISH COLOURS AND WEIGHED ANCHOR WITH A LITTLE WIND WHICH THEN BEGAN TO STIR HAVING WITH THREATS AND PROMISES COMPELLED
INDEPENDENTLY HIRED FREE WORKERS CAN MAKE THEMSELVES RICH BY NATIVE STANDARDS IN A COUPLE OF SEASONS MANY OF THE SERFS PICK UP ENOUGH MONEY FROM US IN INCENTIVE PAY TO BUY THEIR FREEDOM AFTER ONE SEASON WELL IF THE COMPANY'S DOING SO MUCH GOOD ON THIS PLANET
TELLING THEM THEY WERE BETTER SOLDIERS AND OUGHT RATHER TO DIE UNDER THEIR ARMS FIGHTING AS IT BECAME MEN OF COURAGE THAN SURRENDER TO THE SPANIARDS WHO WOULD TAKE AWAY THEIR LIVES WITH THE UTMOST TORMENTS THE PIRATES WERE BUT THIRTY
HEREUPON THEY DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL SENTIMENTS
AND SUCH REVOLUTIONS HAVE THEIR CASUALTIES TOO A NUMBER OF CLASSES AND GROUPS GOT SQUEEZED PRETTY BADLY LIKE THE HORSE BREEDERS AND HARNESS MANUFACTURERS ON TERRA BY THE INVENTION OF THE AUTOMOBILE
BEING DETERRED BY THE MULTITUDES OF SPANIARDS GATHERED ON ALL SIDES TO FALL UPON THEM WHEREOF THEY HAD TIMELY ADVICE
INTENDING TO HANG THEM EVERY ONE AND DOUBTLESS HE HAD DONE SO BUT FOR A STRATAGEM OF BRASILIANO WHICH SAVED THEIR LIVES HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR IN THE NAMES OF OTHER PIRATES THAT WERE ABROAD AT SEA TELLING THEM HE SHOULD HAVE A CARE HOW HE USED THOSE PERSONS HE HAD IN CUSTODY
BLOUNT TOLD HIM HA SHE'S BEEN READING THAT THING OF STANLEY BROWNE'S HE SAID WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH STANLEY BROWNE PAULA DEMANDED
YOU STAY ON THIS PLANET VERY LONG AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN YOU CALL THEM THAT TOO SHE ASKED AS THOUGH DISAPPOINTED IN HIM MAYBE IF YOU STOPPED CALLING THEM GEEKS THEY WOULDN'T RESENT YOU THE WAY THEY DO YOU KNOW THAT'S A NASTY NAME
AFTERWARDS FOR PROVISIONS AND VICTUALLING THEY DRAW OUT OF THE SAME COMMON STOCK ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PIECES OF EIGHT ALSO A SALARY FOR THE SURGEON AND HIS CHEST OF MEDICAMENTS
HE WENT FIRST ASHORE AND INSTANTLY KILLED THE SENTINEL THIS DONE THEY ENTERED THE CITY AND WENT DIRECTLY TO THREE OR FOUR HOUSES OF THE CHIEF CITIZENS WHERE THEY KNOCKED SOFTLY THESE BELIEVING THEM TO BE FRIENDS OPENED THE DOORS AND THE PIRATES SUDDENLY POSSESSING THEMSELVES OF THE HOUSES
BUT NO SOONER HAD THEY WEIGHED ANCHOR WHEN THEY SAW A TROOP OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SPANIARDS ALL WELL ARMED AT THE SEA SIDE AGAINST THESE THEY LET FLY SEVERAL GUNS WHEREWITH THEY FORCED THEM TO QUIT THE SANDS
TWO DAYS AFTER THIS MISFORTUNE THERE AROSE A GREAT STORM WHICH SEPARATED THE SHIPS FROM ONE ANOTHER THE GREAT VESSEL WHERE THE PIRATES WERE ARRIVED AT CAMPECHY
THEY ALL SAT DOWN TOGETHER I SUPPOSE YOU THINK IT'S A JOKE OUR BEING NEARLY MURDERED BY THE PEOPLE WE CAME TO HELP PAULA BEGAN A TRIFLE DEFENSIVELY NOT A VERY FUNNY JOKE VON SCHLICHTEN TOLD HER IT'S BEEN PLAYED ON US TILL IT'S LOST ITS HUMOR YES
THE COMMON REFUGE OF THE PIRATES BEING UPON HIS JOURNEY AND ALL VERY HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AS IS USUAL IN DESERT PLACES THEY WERE PURSUED BY A TROOP OF AN HUNDRED SPANIARDS BRASILIANO PERCEIVING THEIR IMMINENT DANGER ENCOURAGED HIS COMPANIONS
TAKING OUT THE GEEK SPEAKER SHE PUT IT AWAY WHY THAT'S EXACTLY HOW THEY'D PRONOUNCE IT AND DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T HEARD IT BEFORE O'LEARY SAID
WHO WERE TAKEN IN THAT ENCOUNTER BY THOSE INDIANS WERE AS THEIR CRUEL CAPTAIN TORN IN PIECES AND BURNT ALIVE THUS ENDS THE HISTORY THE LIFE
WELL MANNED PROTECTING A FEW CANOES THAT WERE LADING WOOD HEREUPON THEY SENT SIX OF THEIR MEN TO WATCH THEM WHO NEXT MORNING BY A WILE POSSESSED THEMSELVES OF THE CANOES HAVING GIVEN NOTICE TO THEIR COMPANIONS THEY BOARDED THEM AND ALSO TOOK THE LITTLE MAN OF WAR THEIR CONVOY
AND SOME PRISONERS THESE THEY LED AWAY THAT IF ANY OF THEM SHOULD BE TAKEN BY THE SPANIARDS THEY MIGHT USE THEM FOR RANSOM THUS THEY GOT TO THEIR SHIP AND WITH ALL SPEED PUT TO SEA FORCING THE PRISONERS BEFORE THEY LET THEM GO
WITHOUT TAKING SOME BOATS SUCH AS HE LOOKED FOR TO THIS EFFECT HE DETERMINED TO GO ON TO THE COASTS OF CARTHAGENA BUT GOD ALMIGHTY THE TIME OF HIS DIVINE JUSTICE BEING NOW COME HAD APPOINTED THE INDIANS OF DARIEN TO BE THE INSTRUMENTS AND EXECUTIONERS THEREOF
BUT THE MAJOR PART JUDGING THE PROPOUNDED VOYAGE LITTLE TO THEIR PURPOSE SEPARATED FROM LOLONOIS AND THE REST OF THESE ONE MOSES VANCLEIN WAS RINGLEADER CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP TAKEN AT PUERTO CAVALLO
ON THESE ARTICLES THEY YIELDED WITH ALL THEY HAD TAKEN WHICH WAS WORTH IN PEARLS ALONE
THE PORTUGUESE LOST ONLY TEN MEN AND HAD FOUR WOUNDED SO THAT HE HAD STILL REMAINING TWENTY FIGHTING MEN WHEREAS THE SPANIARDS HAD DOUBLE THE NUMBER
FOR HE ORDAINED IT SO THAT THE INDIANS AWARE OF THEIR COMING ALL FLED NOT LEAVING IN THEIR HOUSES OR PLANTATIONS WHICH FOR THE MOST PART BORDER ON THE SIDES OF RIVERS ANY NECESSARY PROVISIONS OR VICTUALS
OTHERWISE SHE LOOKED NONE THE WORSE FOR RECENT EXPERIENCES WELL YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN YOURSELF REPAIRED MISS QUINTON HE GREETED HER FEEL BETTER NOW MISS QUINTON THIS IS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BLOUNT ERIC MISS PAULA QUINTON DELIGHTED MISS QUINTON BLOUNT SAID
THIS UNHAPPY EVENT MUCH ENCOURAGED THOSE IN THE MAN OF WAR THEY GAINING UPON THE PIRATES EVERY MOMENT AND AT LAST OVERTOOK THEM BUT FINDING THEY HAD TWENTY TWO SOUND MEN THE REST BEING EITHER KILLED OR WOUNDED RESOLVED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
YET ALL THIS COURAGE AND VIGOUR LASTED BUT A FORTNIGHT WHEN THEIR HEARTS AS WELL AS BODIES BEGAN TO FAIL FOR HUNGER INSOMUCH AS THEY WERE FORCED TO QUIT THE RIVER AND BETAKE THEMSELVES TO THE WOODS SEEKING OUT SOME VILLAGES WHERE THEY MIGHT FIND RELIEF
AND CARTHAGENA BOUND FOR THE HAVANNAH WELL PROVIDED WITH TWENTY GREAT GUNS AND SEVENTY MEN PASSENGERS AND MARINERS THIS SHIP HE PRESENTLY ASSAULTED WHICH THEY ON BOARD AS RESOLUTELY DEFENDED
THEY PRESENTLY GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND EQUIPPED HIM A BOAT ACCORDINGLY
HIS INTENT WAS TO ROB THE CHURCHES AND RIFLE THE HOUSES OF THE CHIEF CITIZENS OF NICARAGUA THUS IN THE DARK NIGHT THEY ENTERED THE RIVER LEADING TO THAT CITY ROWING IN THEIR CANOES BY DAY THEY HID THEMSELVES AND BOATS UNDER THE BRANCHES OF TREES ON THE BANKS
TWELVE VESSELS WITH A MAN OF WAR FOR THEIR DEFENCE EVERY VESSEL HAS AT LEAST TWO NEGROES IN IT WHO ARE VERY DEXTROUS IN DIVING TO THE DEPTH OF SIX FATHOMS WHERE THEY FIND GOOD STORE OF PEARLS ON THIS FLEET
HE DOUBTED NOT AS SOON AS HE HEARD THEM SPEAK THEY HAD IN THEIR COMPANY AN INDIAN WHO HAD RUN AWAY FROM HIS MASTER
AS THEY FORCED THE PIRATES TO RETIRE BUT THE SMOKE OF THE POWDER CONTINUING THICK AS A DARK FOG OR MIST WITH FOUR CANOES WELL MANNED THEY BOARDED THE SHIP WITH GREAT AGILITY AND FORCED THE SPANIARDS TO SURRENDER THE SHIP BEING TAKEN THEY FOUND NOT IN HER WHAT THEY THOUGHT
THAT WE'VE RAISED THE GENERAL LIVING STANDARD OF THIS PLANET BY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PERCENT RAKKEED IS A ZIRK VON SCHLICHTEN SAID THEY'RE THE NOMADS WHO HIRE OUT TO THE NORTHERN MERCHANTS AS CARAVAN DRIVERS AND ALSO PREY OR USED TO PREY ON THE CARAVANS AS BRIGANDS
THEY CLAIM WE MAKE THEM DISSATISFIED WITH THE TREATMENT THEY GET AT HOME OF COURSE THEY'RE ALWAYS GLAD TO HAVE THE PEASANTS TAKEN OFF THEIR HANDS DURING A SLACK AGRICULTURAL SEASON BLOUNT ADDED AND WE TRAIN WORKERS TO HANDLE CONTRAGRAVITY POWER EQUIPMENT
FIGHTING LIKE A COMMANDO HOW IS MOHAMMED BY THE WAY NO DANGER I HOPE WE ALL LIKE HIM MOHAMMED FERRIERA WAS STILL UNCONSCIOUS THE GIRL REPORTED HE HAD A MINOR CONCUSSION
WHO FULL OF HORRID EXECRABLE AND ENORMOUS DEEDS AND DEBTOR TO SO MUCH INNOCENT BLOOD DIED BY CRUEL AND BUTCHERLY HANDS SUCH AS HIS OWN WERE IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE THOSE THAT REMAINED IN THE ISLAND DE LAS PERTAS
THE PIRATE ESCAPING THE FIRST ENCOUNTER RESOLVED TO ATTACK HER MORE VIGOROUSLY THAN BEFORE SEEING HE HAD YET SUFFERED NO GREAT DAMAGE THIS HE PERFORMED WITH SO MUCH RESOLUTION THAT AT LAST AFTER A LONG AND DANGEROUS FIGHT HE BECAME MASTER OF IT
WHEN YOU GET UP NORTH WATCH HOW THE PEASANTS KILL THESE LITTLE THINGS LIKE SIX LEGGED IGUANAS THAT THEY RAISE FOR FOOD THAT ISN'T THE REASON THOUGH VON SCHLICHTEN SAID AS WE USE IT THE WORD'S PURE ONOMATOPOEIA
AND VERY OFTEN HE WOULD THROW THESE LIQUORS ABOUT THE STREETS AND WET PEOPLES CLOTHES WITHOUT REGARDING WHETHER HE SPOILED THEIR APPAREL AMONG THEMSELVES THESE PIRATES ARE VERY LIBERAL IF ANY ONE HAS LOST ALL WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS IN THEIR MANNER OF LIFE
HIS SHIP BEING TOO GREAT TO GET OUT AT THE REFLUX OF THOSE SEAS THERE HE SUSTAINED GREAT WANT OF PROVISIONS SO AS THEY WERE CONSTRAINED TO GO ASHORE EVERY DAY TO SEEK SUSTENANCE AND NOT FINDING ANYTHING ELSE THEY WERE FORCED TO KILL AND EAT MONKEYS AND OTHER ANIMALS SUCH AS THEY COULD FIND
BARBAROUS AND CRUEL OUT OF AN INVETERATE HATRED AGAINST THAT NATION OF THESE HE COMMANDED SEVERAL TO BE ROASTED ALIVE ON WOODEN SPITS FOR NOT SHOWING HIM HOG YARDS WHERE HE MIGHT STEAL SWINE AFTER MANY OF THESE CRUELTIES AS HE WAS CRUISING ON THE COASTS OF CAMPECHY
GIVING THEMSELVES TO ALL MANNER OF DEBAUCHERY SUCH OF THESE PIRATES WILL SPEND TWO OR THREE THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT IN A NIGHT NOT LEAVING THEMSELVES A GOOD SHIRT TO WEAR IN THE MORNING MY OWN MASTER WOULD BUY SOMETIMES A PIPE OF WINE
NOW LOOK YOU JUST CAME HERE FROM NIFLHEIM VON SCHLICHTEN OBJECTED THE COMPANY EMPLOYS QUITE A FEW GEEKS THERE HOW MUCH BRUTALITY DID YOU RUN INTO THERE WELL I MUST ADMIT THE ULLERANS WHO WORK THERE ARE VERY WELL TREATED EXCEPT THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO EMPLOY ANY PEOPLE WITH SILICONE BODY TISSUES
THAT IN A LITTLE TIME THEY COMPELLED THE SPANIARDS TO SURRENDER
FIRST THEREFORE THEY MENTION HOW MUCH THE CAPTAIN IS TO HAVE FOR HIS SHIP NEXT THE SALARY OF THE CARPENTER OR SHIPWRIGHT WHO CAREENED MENDED AND RIGGED THE VESSEL THIS COMMONLY AMOUNTS TO ONE HUNDRED OR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PIECES OF EIGHT ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT
ESPECIALLY A PARTY OF THEM WHO WERE BUT RAW IN THOSE EXERCISES AND WHO IMAGINED AT THEIR SETTING FORTH FROM TORTUGA THAT PIECES OF EIGHT WERE GATHERED AS EASY AS PEARS FROM A TREE BUT FINDING MOST THINGS CONTRARY TO THEIR EXPECTATION THEY QUITTED THE FLEET AND RETURNED
SINCE OUR AIR FREIGHTERS GOT INTO OPERATION NEITHER CARAVAN DRIVING NOR CARAVAN RAIDING HAS BEEN A PAYING BUSINESS AND OUR AIR PATROLS HAVE MADE CARAVAN RAIDING SUICIDAL AS WELL SO THE ZIRKS DON'T LIKE US THE ONLY THING THEY KNOW OR ARE WILLING TO LEARN IS HANDLING THESE SIX LEGGED RIDING AND PACK ANIMALS WE CALL HIPPOSAURS
A PRINCIPAL CITY IN NEUVA GRANADA BUT THE BOLD ATTEMPTS AND ACTIONS OF JOHN DAVIS BORN AT JAMAICA OUGHT NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN BEING SOME OF THE MOST REMARKABLE ESPECIALLY HIS RARE PRUDENCE AND VALOUR SHOWED IN THE FORE MENTIONED KINGDOM OF GRANADA THIS PIRATE HAVING LONG CRUISED IN THE GULF OF POCATAURO
WHICH USUALLY IS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PIECES OF EIGHT LASTLY THEY AGREE WHAT RATE EACH ONE OUGHT TO HAVE THAT IS EITHER WOUNDED OR MAIMED IN HIS BODY SUFFERING THE LOSS OF ANY LIMB AS FOR THE LOSS OF A RIGHT ARM SIX HUNDRED PIECES OF EIGHT OR SIX SLAVES
HERE THEY GOT ASHORE IN A CANOE AND MARCHING ALONG THE COAST WITH ALL THE SPEED THEY COULD
SO HE'S BEEN CURRYING FAVOR WITH THE URBAN MERCHANTS THAT MAKES HIM AS PRO RAKKEED AND AS ANTI TERRAN AS THEY ARE AT KRINK KING JONKVANK HAS THE SUPPORT OF HIS BARONS BUT HE'S AFRAID OF HIS URBAN BOURGEOISIE AND WE PAY HIM A HANDSOME SUBSIDY SO HE'S PRO TERRAN AND ANTI RAKKEED
WAS CRUISING IN A BOAT OF THIRTY MEN AND FOUR SMALL GUNS FROM JAMAICA
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SOUND LIKE GEEK GEEK GEEK AS FAR AS THAT GOES YOU KNOW WHAT THE GEEK NAME FOR A TERRAN IS BLOUNT ASKED
FOR BEING ARRIVED AT CAMPECHY WITH AN UNDAUNTED COURAGE AND WITHOUT ANY NOISE HE ASSAULTED THE SAID SHIP
SHE LOOKED PUZZLED FOR A MOMENT THEN SLIPPED IN HER ENUNCIATOR
FOR A FINGER THE SAME AS FOR AN EYE ALL WHICH SUMS ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE COMMON STOCK OF WHAT IS GOTTEN BY THEIR PIRACY AND A VERY EXACT AND EQUAL DIVIDEND IS MADE OF THE REMAINDER THEY HAVE ALSO REGARD TO QUALITIES AND PLACES
THE BOYS NOT BEING OMITTED WHO DRAW HALF A SHARE BECAUSE WHEN THEY TAKE A BETTER VESSEL THAN THEIR OWN IT IS IN THE BOYS DUTY TO FIRE THEIR FORMER VESSEL AND THEN RETIRE TO THE PRIZE THEY OBSERVE AMONG THEMSELVES VERY GOOD ORDERS
HIS SHIP STRUCK ON A BANK OF SAND WHERE IT STUCK SO FAST AS NO ART COULD GET HER OFF AGAIN THOUGH THEY UNLADED ALL THE GUNS IRON AND OTHER WEIGHTY THINGS AS MUCH AS THEY COULD HEREUPON THEY WERE FORCED TO BREAK THE SHIP IN PIECES AND WITH PLANKS AND NAILS
THE MAN OF WAR SCARCE HALF A LEAGUE DISTANT FROM THE SMALL SHIPS AND THE WIND VERY CALM
BUT ALL IN VAIN FOR HAVING RANGED UP AND DOWN THE WOODS FOR SOME DAYS WITHOUT FINDING THE LEAST COMFORT THEY WERE FORCED TO RETURN TO THE RIVER
AND NOT MEETING ANY OF THEM RESOLVED AT LAST TO LAND IN NICARAGUA LEAVING HIS SHIP HID ON THE COAST THIS DESIGN HE SOON EXECUTED FOR TAKING EIGHTY MEN OUT OF NINETY WHICH HE HAD IN ALL AND THE REST HE LEFT TO KEEP THE SHIP HE DIVIDED THEM EQUALLY INTO THREE CANOES
BEING THUS MASTERS OF THIS FLEET THEY WANTED ONLY PROVISIONS OF WHICH THEY FOUND LITTLE ABOARD THOSE VESSELS BUT THIS DEFECT WAS SUPPLIED BY THE HORSES WHICH THEY KILLED AND SALTED WITH SALT WHICH BY GOOD FORTUNE THE WOOD CUTTERS HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM WITH WHICH THEY SUPPORTED THEMSELVES TILL THEY COULD GET BETTER
AND TAKE THE CITY OF CARTHAGENA THESE TWO CREWS OF PIRATES BEING NOW JOINED WERE INFINITELY GLAD AT THE PRESENCE AND SOCIETY OF ONE ANOTHER
THIS THEY PERFORMED VERY COURAGEOUSLY FOR SOME TIME TILL THEY WERE FORCED BY THE MAN OF WAR ON CONDITION THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED AS SLAVES TO CARRY STONES OR BE EMPLOYED IN OTHER LABOURS FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS AS THEY SERVED THEIR NEGROES BUT THAT THEY SHOULD BE SET SAFE ASHORE ON FREE LAND
AND NOT MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED GEEKS ALL EMPLOYED ON CONSTRUCTION WORK AND IN THE MINES ON THE PLANET ITSELF WORKING DIRECTLY UNDER TERRAN SUPERVISION WE USE THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOUR HANDS AND IN THE POWER DRIVEN CONTRAGRAVITY ARMOR THAT'S NECESSARY THERE
HAVING VANQUISHED THE ENEMY THEY MOUNTED ON HORSES THEY FOUND IN THE FIELD AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY BRASILIANO HAVING LOST BUT TWO OF HIS COMPANIONS IN THIS BLOODY FIGHT AND HAD TWO WOUNDED PROSECUTING THEIR WAY BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE PORT THEY SPIED A BOAT AT ANCHOR FROM CAMPECHY
WHEREIN THEY HAD LIVED TEN ENTIRE MONTHS THESE BECAUSE THEY WERE NOW CONSIDERABLY STRENGTHENED TO EFFECT WITH GREATER SATISFACTION THEIR DESIGNS
MOST OF THE SPANIARDS TO ASSIST HIM BUT SO SOON AS THE MAN OF WAR PERCEIVED ONE OF HIS FLEET TO SAIL HE DID SO TOO FEARING LEST THE MARINERS DESIGNED TO RUN AWAY WITH THE RICHES THEY HAD ON BOARD
IN THE FIRST CENTURY PRE ATOMIC IT DESIGNATED A DEGRADED PERSON WHO PERFORMED SOME SORT OF REVOLTING PUBLIC EXHIBITION BITING OFF LIVE CHICKENS HEADS IN A SIDESHOW WILD MAN ACT HIDEYOSHI O'LEARY SUPPLIED
AFTER SCOT CAME ANOTHER NAMED MANSVELT WHO INVADED GRANADA AND PENETRATED EVEN TO THE SOUTH SEA TILL AT LAST FOR WANT OF PROVISION HE WAS FORCED TO GO BACK HE ASSAULTED THE ISLE OF SAINT CATHERINE WHICH HE TOOK WITH A FEW PRISONERS THESE DIRECTED HIM TO CARTHAGENA
THE TERRAN FEDERATION SPACE NAVY DISCOVERED AND EXPLORED BOTH ULLER AND NIFLHEIM WHICH MADE BOTH PLANETS PUBLIC DOMAIN THE COMPANY WAS ORIGINALLY FORMED TO EXPLOIT ULLER ALONE BUT THE FEDERATION INSISTED THAT BOTH PLANETS WOULD HAVE TO BE FRANCHISED TO THE SAME COMPANY
IT'S A FACT YOU CAN EASILY VERIFY THAT PERMISSION TO JOIN THE LABOR COMPANIES AT THE POLAR MINES IS REGARDED AS A PRIVILEGE GRANTED AS A REWARD OR DENIED AS A PUNISHMENT AND MOST OF THE GEEK LANDOWNERS ARE BITTERLY CRITICAL OF THE WAY WE TREAT OUR LABOR AT THE MINES
AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND ANY PREY AT LAST HE RESOLVED TO DIRECT HIS COURSE TO RANCHEIRAS NEAR THE RIVER DE LA PLATA
FOR IN THE PRIZES WHICH THEY TAKE IT IS SEVERELY PROHIBITED TO EVERY ONE TO TAKE ANYTHING TO THEMSELVES HENCE ALL THEY TAKE IS EQUALLY DIVIDED AS HATH BEEN SAID BEFORE YEA THEY TAKE A SOLEMN OATH TO EACH OTHER
BEING ALREADY ALMOST UNLADEN ALL THEY GOT WAS ONLY FIFTY BARS OF IRON A SMALL PARCEL OF PAPER SOME EARTHEN JARS OF WINE AND OTHER THINGS OF SMALL IMPORTANCE THEN LOLONOIS CALLED A COUNCIL OF WAR AND TOLD THEM HE INTENDED FOR GUATEMALA
FOR IF HE HURT THEM IN THE LEAST THEY SWORE THEY WOULD NEVER GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD THAT SHOULD FALL INTO THEIR HANDS THESE PIRATES HAVING BEEN OFTEN AT CAMPECHY AND OTHER PLACES OF THE WEST INDIES IN THE SPANISH DOMINIONS THE GOVERNOR FEARED WHAT MISCHIEF THEIR COMPANIONS ABROAD MIGHT DO
AND WE CAN BELIEVE OH UP TO EIGHTY PERCENT OF WHAT HE TELLS US AND THAT'S SIXTY PERCENT BETTER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER NATIVE PRINCES
BUT THE INDIANS WITHIN A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL TOOK HIM PRISONER AND TORE HIM IN PIECES ALIVE THROWING HIS BODY LIMB BY LIMB INTO THE FIRE AND HIS ASHES INTO THE AIR THAT NO TRACE OR MEMORY MIGHT REMAIN OF SUCH AN INFAMOUS INHUMAN CREATURE
NOT AS RICH OR AS ACCESSIBLE BLOUNT SAID YOU KNOW WHAT THE SEASONS ARE LIKE AT THE POLES OF THIS PLANET
THE NIMBLE FRENCHMAN ESCAPED BUT THE SPANIARD BEING NOT SO SWIFT WAS TAKEN AND HEARD OF NO MORE SOME DAYS AFTER TWELVE PIRATES SET FORTH WELL ARMED TO SEEK THEIR COMPANION AMONG WHOM WAS THE FRENCHMAN
AND THOUGH IN HIS PRIVATE AFFAIRS HE GOVERNED HIMSELF VERY WELL HE WOULD OFTENTIMES APPEAR BRUTISH AND FOOLISH WHEN IN DRINK RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE STREETS BEATING AND WOUNDING THOSE HE MET NO PERSON DARING TO MAKE ANY RESISTANCE TO THE SPANIARDS HE WAS ALWAYS VERY
LADEN WITH DIVERS SORTS OF MERCHANDISE AND PIECES OF EIGHT DESIGNED TO BUY COCOA NUTS FOR THEIR LADING HOME
SHE LEANED TOWARD THE LIGHTER FLAME O'LEARY HAD SNAPPED INTO BEING I SUSPECT THAT OF BEING A PRINCIPLE YOU'D LIKE ME TO BEAR IN MIND AT THE POLAR MINES WHEN I SEE LET'S SAY SOME LABORER BEING BEATEN BY A COUPLE OF OVERSEERS WITH THREE FOOT LENGTHS OF THREE QUARTER INCH STEEL CABLE
THE MERCHANTS IN THE NORTH DON'T LIKE US BESIDE SPOILING THE CARAVAN TRADE WE'RE SPOILING THEIR LOCAL BUSINESS BECAUSE THE LAND OWNING BARONS WHO USED TO DEAL WITH THEM ARE NOW DEALING DIRECTLY WITH US
AND PLACING IT IN THE STREET WOULD FORCE THOSE THAT PASSED BY TO DRINK WITH HIM
HERE THEY ALLOW TWICE A DAY EVERY ONE AS MUCH AS HE CAN EAT WITHOUT WEIGHT OR MEASURE NOR DOES THE STEWARD OF THE VESSEL GIVE ANY MORE FLESH OR ANYTHING ELSE TO THE CAPTAIN THAN TO THE MEANEST MARINER THE SHIP BEING WELL VICTUALLED
THEY DELIBERATE WHITHER THEY SHALL GO TO SEEK THEIR DESPERATE FORTUNES AND LIKEWISE AGREE UPON CERTAIN ARTICLES WHICH ARE PUT IN WRITING WHICH EVERY ONE IS BOUND TO OBSERVE AND ALL OF THEM OR THE CHIEFEST PART DO SET THEIR HANDS TO IT
BY REASON OF HIS LONG RESIDENCE IN BRASIL HENCE HE WAS FORCED TO FLY WHEN THE PORTUGUESE RETOOK THOSE COUNTRIES FROM THE DUTCH SEVERAL NATIONS THEN INHABITING AT BRASIL AS ENGLISH FRENCH DUTCH AND OTHERS
AND MARCHED IN GOOD ORDER TO THE TOWN OF THE SAME NAME THIS THEY TOOK AND TOTALLY PILLAGED THOUGH THE SPANIARDS MADE A STRONG RESISTANCE THEY BROUGHT AWAY SOME OF THE INHABITANTS AS PRISONERS WITH ALL THEY HAD
WHICH GROW VERY THICK ALONG THE RIVER SIDES IN THOSE COUNTRIES AND ALONG THE SEA COAST BEING ARRIVED AT THE CITY THE THIRD NIGHT THE SENTINEL WHO KEPT THE POST OF THE RIVER THOUGHT THEM TO BE FISHERMEN THAT HAD BEEN FISHING IN THE LAKE AND MOST OF THE PIRATES UNDERSTANDING SPANISH
HAVING POSSESSED THEMSELVES OF THE SHIP THE WIND BEING CONTRARY TO RETURN TO JAMAICA THEY RESOLVED TO STEER TO CAPE SAINT ANTHONY WHICH LIES WEST OF CUBA THERE TO REPAIR AND TAKE IN FRESH WATER OF WHICH THEY WERE THEN IN GREAT WANT BEING VERY NEAR THE CAPE
WITH ALL THIS THEY ARRIVED AT JAMAICA SOON AFTER BUT THIS SORT OF PEOPLE BEING NEVER LONG MASTERS OF THEIR MONEY THEY WERE SOON CONSTRAINED TO SEEK MORE BY THE SAME MEANS AND CAPTAIN JOHN DAVIS PRESENTLY AFTER HIS RETURN WAS CHOSEN ADMIRAL OF SEVEN OR EIGHT VESSELS
ABOVESAID THEY UNEXPECTEDLY MET WITH THREE GREAT SHIPS COMING FROM NEW SPAIN AND BOUND FOR THE HAVANNAH
SO THAT THE WHOLE CITY WAS IN AN UPROAR AND ALL THE CITIZENS RALLIED IN ORDER TO A DEFENCE
THERE WILL BE VIOLENT CIRCULAR STORMS OF HOT WIND BLOWING AWAY THE LIGHT SAND AND DUST AND LEAVING THE HEAVIER PARTICLES OF METALLIC ORES AND METALS BEHIND
THEY MADE HIM CAPTAIN WITHIN A FEW DAYS AFTER HE TOOK A GREAT SHIP COMING FROM NEW SPAIN WHICH HAD A GREAT QUANTITY OF PLATE ON BOARD AND CARRIED IT TO JAMAICA THIS ACTION GOT HIM A GREAT REPUTATION AT HOME
WITH HIM JOINED ANOTHER COMRADE OF HIS BY NAME PIERRE LE PICARD WHO SEEING THE REST LEAVE LOLONOIS THOUGHT FIT TO DO THE SAME THESE RUNAWAYS HAVING THUS PARTED COMPANY STEERED HOMEWARDS COASTING ALONG THE CONTINENT TILL THEY CAME TO COSTA RICA HERE THEY LANDED A STRONG PARTY NIGH THE RIVER VERAGUAS
IN THE NORTH METALLURGY AND FOOD PREPARATION HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COMBINED THAT WAY YES IF YOU THINK THE NATIVES WHO WORK AT THE MINES FEEL THEMSELVES ILL TREATED YOU MIGHT PROPOSE CLOSING THEM DOWN ENTIRELY AND SEE WHAT THE NATIVE REACTION WOULD BE VON SCHLICHTEN TOLD HER
BESIDES THE VESSEL PROVISIONS GOODS
THESE INDIANS OF DARIEN ARE ESTEEMED AS BRAVOES OR WILD SAVAGE INDIANS BY THE NEIGHBOURING SPANIARDS WHO NEVER COULD CIVILIZE THEM HITHER LOLONOIS CAME BROUGHT BY HIS EVIL CONSCIENCE THAT CRIED FOR PUNISHMENT THINKING TO ACT HIS CRUELTIES
SOMETIMES THEY ROB SUCH OR SUCH HOG YARDS WHERE THE SPANIARDS OFTEN HAVE A THOUSAND HEAD OF SWINE TOGETHER THEY COME TO THESE PLACES IN THE NIGHT AND HAVING BESET THE KEEPER'S LODGE THEY FORCE HIM TO RISE AND GIVE THEM AS MANY HEADS AS THEY DESIRE THREATENING TO KILL HIM IF HE REFUSES
A DISMAL TEMPEST SURPRISED HIM SO VIOLENTLY THAT HIS SHIP WAS WRECKED UPON THE COASTS THE MARINERS ONLY ESCAPING WITH THEIR MUSKETS AND SOME FEW BULLETS AND POWDER WHICH WERE THE ONLY THINGS THEY COULD SAVE
AND WITHAL HE SENT THEM AS COMMON MARINERS IN THE GALLEONS TO SPAIN THEY GOT IN THIS VOYAGE ALL TOGETHER FIVE HUNDRED PIECES OF EIGHT SO THAT THEY TARRIED NOT LONG THERE AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL PROVIDING THEMSELVES WITH NECESSARIES THEY RETURNED TO JAMAICA FROM WHENCE THEY SET FORTH AGAIN TO SEA
AND GIVE HIM BACK ALL HIS GOLD AND SILVER JACK PUT IT ALL IN THE TWO ENDS OF A SACK AND LAID IT ACROSS NEDDY'S BACK AND ALL TOOK THE ROAD IN THEIR HANDS AWAY THEY WENT THROUGH BOGS UP HILLS DOWN DALES
AND WHEN THE HARE WAS ENTERING THE CASTLE WHERE THE TWELVE SONS OF THE GRUAGACH WERE KILLED THE COWBOY CAUGHT HIM BY THE TWO HIND LEGS AND DASHED OUT HIS BRAINS AGAINST THE WALL AND THE SKULL OF THE HARE WAS KNOCKED INTO THE CHIEF ROOM OF THE CASTLE
TOLD THE MASTER HE CAME UP JACK YOU ANOINTED SCOUNDREL WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO GO TO SLEEP
AND CUTLASHES SITTING AT A TABLE EATING ROAST BEEF AND PORK AND DRINKING MULLED BEER AND WINE AND WHISKY PUNCH WASN'T THAT A FINE HAUL WE MADE AT THE LORD OF DUNLAVIN'S
ALL THE STICKING PLASTER IN ENNISCORTHY WILL BE TOO LITTLE FOR THE CUTS AND BRUISES I HAVE ON ME AH
SAYS HE HELP ME OUT OR I'LL BE DROWNED NEVER SAY'T TWICE SAYS JACK AND HE
THEN SNAPPED THE TWELVE HEADS OFF THEM AND TURNING TO THEIR FATHER SAID
JACK AND HIS COMRADES ONCE THERE WAS A POOR WIDOW AS OFTEN THERE HAS BEEN AND SHE HAD ONE SON A VERY SCARCE SUMMER CAME AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY'D LIVE TILL THE NEW POTATOES WOULD BE FIT FOR EATING
AND WHEN HE HAD THEM OFF HE CUT OUT THE TONGUES AND THREW THE HEADS OVER THE WALL THEN HE PUT THE TONGUES IN HIS POCKET AND DROVE HOME THE CATTLE THAT EVENING THE GRUAGACH
AND SIT ON NEDDY'S CRUPPER WHEN YOUR LEGS AND WINGS ARE TIRED WELL THE MARCH BEGAN AGAIN AND JUST AS THE SUN WAS GONE DOWN THEY LOOKED AROUND AND THERE WAS NEITHER CABIN NOR FARM HOUSE IN SIGHT WELL WELL SAYS JACK
WHAT PUT A STOP TO THE LAUGHING OF THE GRUAGACH THE SHEE AN GANNON MADE NO ANSWER BUT LEFT THE KING AND PUSHED AWAY TO KNOW COULD HE FIND WHY THE GRUAGACH WAS SILENT HE TOOK A GLEN AT A STEP
YOU NASTY BRUTE
I GOT A PELT FROM A SLEDGE HAMMER THAT SENT ME HALF A MILE OFF IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME I'LL GIVE YOU LEAVE TO GO AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES OH MY POOR CAPTAIN SAYS THEY
I COULD DEFEND MYSELF BETTER WITH THE IRON THAN THE WOODEN PIKE YELLOW FACE GAVE ME THE IRON PIKE
WHEN HE WAS RESTED AND GOT SOMETHING TO EAT HE TOLD THEM HOW HE GOT SERVICE WITH THE GRAY CHURL OF THE TOWNLAND OF MISCHANCE AND THAT THE AGREEMENT WAS WHOEVER WOULD FIRST SAY HE WAS SORRY FOR HIS BARGAIN
THE ELDEST GOT TIRED OF STAYING AT HOME AND SAID HE'D GO LOOK FOR SERVICE HE STAYED AWAY A WHOLE YEAR AND THEN CAME BACK ONE DAY DRAGGING ONE FOOT AFTER THE OTHER AND A POOR WIZENED FACE ON HIM
GO AND SEARCH FOR THEM AS IF THEY WERE YOUR OWN THE HEIFERS WERE ALL IN THE PADDOCK BEFORE SUNSET NEXT MORNING SAYS THE MASTER JACK THE PATH ACROSS THE BOG TO THE PASTURE IS VERY BAD THE SHEEP DOES BE SINKING IN IT EVERY STEP
HE TOOK THE SKIN OF A BLACK SHEEP THAT HAD BEEN HANGING ON THE WALL FOR SEVEN YEARS AND CLAPPED IT ON MY BODY IN PLACE OF MY OWN FLESH AND SKIN AND THE SHEEPSKIN GREW ON ME AND EVERY YEAR SINCE THEN I SHEAR MYSELF
SHE GAVE HIM THAT THINKING HE'D TAKE IT TO THE BOG BUT HE FELL TO ON THE SPOT AND DID NOT LEAVE A SCRAP TO TELL TALES ON HIM AND THE MISTRESS WAS A LITTLE ASTONISHED HE CALLED TO SPEAK TO THE MASTER IN THE HAGGARD AND SAID HE
AND I'LL HAVE THE FEET OFF EVERY SHEEP IN THE FLOCK WHILE YOU'D BE BLESSING YOURSELF FEET OFF MY SHEEP YOU ANOINTED ROGUE AND WHAT WOULD YOU BE TAKING THEIR FEET OFF FOR
THE SHEE AN GANNON TOOK SERVICE AND ATE HIS SUPPER THEN THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SAID I AM THE GRUAGACH GAIRE NOW THAT YOU ARE MY MAN AND HAVE EATEN YOUR SUPPER YOU'LL HAVE A BED OF SILK TO SLEEP ON
AND THE LORD OF DUNLAVIN AND HIS PRETTY DAUGHTER THAT WERE STANDING AT THE PARLOUR WINDOW UNKNOWNST TO THE PORTER PUT OUT THEIR HEADS I'D BE GLAD BARNEY SAYS THE MASTER TO HEAR YOUR ANSWER TO THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE RED COMB ON HIM
WELL HE COULDN'T IMAGINE WHO THREW IT AT HIM OR WHY IT WAS THROWN AT HIM AFTER A LITTLE HE GOT A BLOW ON THE OTHER CHEEK
HAD GUARDED THE FIVE GOLDEN COWS AND THE BULL WITHOUT HORNS CUT OFF THE HEADS OF THE FIVE HEADED GIANT KILLED THE WIZARD HARE AND BROUGHT HIS OWN TWELVE SONS TO LIFE AND THEN SAID THE GRUAGACH HE IS THE ONLY MAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD
MAYBE I WON'T REMEMBER YOUR KINDNESS IF EVER I FIND YOU IN HARDSHIP AND WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE YOU ALL GOING WE'RE GOING TO SEEK OUR FORTUNE TILL THE HARVEST COMES IN
AND AS SOON AS HE FOUND THAT HIS LEGS WERE ABLE TO CARRY HIM HE CRAWLED AWAY DRAGGING ONE FOOT AFTER ANOTHER TILL HE REACHED THE WOOD WELL WELL CRIED THEM ALL WHEN HE CAME WITHIN HEARING
TO HOLD THE MILK OF THE FIVE GOLDEN COWS
THIS DAMP GRASS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR WARM ROOM SAYS ONE I WAS OBLIGED TO DROP A FINE PIG'S FOOT SAYS ANOTHER
THE NEXT DAY THREE HEIFERS WERE MISSING AND THE MASTER BADE JACK GO IN SEARCH OF THEM

WHAT FOR OH I SEE YOU'VE FORGOT YOUR BARGAIN ARE YOU SORRY FOR IT
THE MASTER CAUGHT HIMSELF IN TIME BUT HE WAS SO STOMACHED HE SAID NOTHING
BACK FOREMOST BUT THE ASS RECEIVED HIM WITH A KICK ON THE BROADEST PART OF HIS SMALL CLOTHES AND LAID HIM COMFORTABLY ON THE DUNGHILL WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND BEGAN TO THINK WHAT HAPPENED HIM
THE MISTRESS GOD BLESS HER

SATURDAY SUNDAY MISTER WILLIAMS HAS BEEN HERE BOTH THESE DAYS AS USUAL BUT IS VERY INDIFFERENTLY RECEIVED STILL BY MISSUS JEWKES AND TO AVOID SUSPICION I LEFT THEM TOGETHER
BEING A CUNNING ARTFUL WOMAN I KNOW NOT WHAT TO MAKE OF IT I HAVE REFUSED HER ABSOLUTELY URGING THAT EXCEPT I INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE HIS SUIT I OUGHT NOT TO DO IT AND SHE IS GONE WITHOUT ME I HAVE
I WISH HE WAS AS GOOD BUT I HOPE HE WILL NOW REFORM
BUT IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO TALK OF THESE THINGS
AS HE HAS DONE AND I SHALL THINK YOU HAVE SOME FAVOUR FOR ME AND RELIANCE UPON ME AND PERHAPS YOU MIGHT NOT REPENT IT SHE WAS SO EARNEST THAT I MISTRUSTED SHE DID THIS TO PUMP ME AND I KNEW HOW
HE SAYS IN HIS LETTER HE WAS A FRIGHTFUL SPECTACLE HE MIGHT BE SO INDEED WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN A DOORS BUT HE LOOKS WELL ENOUGH NOW AND ONLY FOR A FEW GROANS NOW AND THEN WHEN HE THINKS OF HIS DANGER
AND I CAN MORE EASILY BE INDUCED WITH YOU WHEN ALL MY APPREHENSIONS ARE OVER TO CONSIDER HIS PROPOSAL OF MISTER WILLIAMS THAN I COULD HERE AND HE PRETENDS AS YOU HAVE READ IN HIS LETTER
AND HERE IS THE BULL IT HAS AS EFFECTUALLY FRIGHTENED ME AS IF I HAD BEEN HURT BY IT INSTEAD OF THE COOK MAID AND SO THESE JOINED TOGETHER AS I MAY SAY TO MAKE A VERY DASTARD OF ME
TO HELP MYSELF ANY WHERE ELSE O WHY ARE POOR FOOLISH MAIDENS TRIED WITH SUCH DANGERS WHEN THEY HAVE SUCH WEAK MINDS TO GRAPPLE WITH THEM I WILL SINCE IT IS SO HOPE THE BEST
GOD BLESS HIM FOR EVER O WHAT A DEAL WE HAVE TO SAY TO YOU GOD GIVE US A HAPPY MEETING WE UNDERSTAND THE SQUIRE IS SETTING OUT FOR LONDON HE IS A FINE GENTLEMAN AND HAS WIT AT WILL
BUT MY FOLLY WAS THE WORST OF ALL BECAUSE THAT DEPRIVED ME OF MY MONEY FOR HAD I HAD THAT I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE VENTURED BOTH THE BULL AND THE ROBBERS MONDAY AFTERNOON
AS TO SUPPOSE EVERY ONE IN A PLOT AGAINST ME
O MY FOOLISH FEARS OF BULLS AND ROBBERS FOR NOW ALL MY UNEASINESS BEGINS TO DOUBLE UPON ME O WHAT HAS THIS INCAUTIOUS MAN SAID THAT NO DOUBT IS THE SUBJECT OF HER LONG LETTER
PRAY DEAREST MADAM LAY ASIDE YOUR FEARS AND WAIT A FEW DAYS FOR THE ISSUE OF MISSUS JEWKES'S LETTER AND MINE OF THANKS TO MISTER B THINGS I HOPE MUST BE BETTER THAN YOU EXPECT
I BEGIN TO WISH I HAD VENTURED EVERY THING AND GONE OFF WHEN I MIGHT O WHEN WILL THIS STATE OF DOUBT AND UNEASINESS END SHE HAS JUST BEEN WITH ME AND SAYS
THAT HURT THE POOR COOK MAID WHO IS GOT PRETTY WELL AGAIN MISTER WILLIAMS POINTED AT THE SUNFLOWER BUT I WAS FORCED TO BE VERY RESERVED TO HIM FOR THE POOR GENTLEMAN HAS NO GUARD NO CAUTION AT ALL
AND TRUST TO PROVIDENCE TO GUIDE HIM FOR MY SAFEGUARD FOR I WOULD NOT ENDANGER YOU NOW JUST UPON THE EDGE OF YOUR PREFERMENT YET SIR I FEAR YOUR FATAL OPENNESS WILL MAKE YOU SUSPECTED AS ACCESSARY
MY HEART UP AT MY MOUTH I COULD NOT SEE I WAS WATCHED SO THIS LOOKS WELL BUT IF ANY THING SHOULD GO BAD AFTERWARDS I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR NOT TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY WELL I WILL GO DOWN AGAIN
YOUR MOST FAITHFUL HUMBLE SERVANT
AND SURE MY MASTER CANNOT BE SO BLACK AS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT WHAT CAN I DO I HAVE A GOOD MIND TO TRY FOR IT ONCE MORE BUT THEN I MAY BE PURSUED AND TAKEN AND IT WILL BE WORSE FOR ME
SO HERE I AM AGAIN
YOUR MOST FAITHFUL HUMBLE SERVANT I WAS TOO FREE INDEED WITH MISSUS JEWKES LED TO IT BY HER DISSIMULATION AND BY HER PRETENDED CONCERN TO MAKE ME HAPPY WITH YOU I HINTED
BEGGING THE CONTINUANCE OF YOUR PRAYERS AND BLESSINGS YOUR EVER DUTIFUL DAUGHTER MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER
EVERY THING GIVES ME ADDITIONAL DISTURBANCE THE MISSED LETTER OF JOHN ARNOLD'S MAKES ME SUSPECT A PLOT
I TOLD HER I WAS RESOLVED TO GIVE NO ENCOURAGEMENT TILL I HAD TALKED TO MY FATHER AND MOTHER SHE SAID HE FANCIED I THOUGHT OF SOMEBODY ELSE OR I COULD NEVER BE SO INSENSIBLE
I CANNOT HELP SAYING THAT I DON'T LIKE THIS THING AND THEIR TAKING HIS LETTERS MOST ALARMS ME HOW HAPPY IT WAS THEY MISSED MY PACKET I KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK OF IT BUT WHY SHOULD I LET EVERY ACCIDENT BREAK MY PEACE
I WILL GIVE YOU THE SUBSTANCE ONLY I EXPOSTULATED WITH HIM ON HIS TOO GREAT OPENNESS AND EASINESS
THAT I COULD NOT THINK OF ANY SCHEME OF LIFE WITH PLEASURE TILL I HAD TRIED THAT I ASKED HER FOR MY MONEY AND SHE SAID IT WAS ABOVE IN HER STRONG BOX BUT THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT TO MORROW
MISSUS JEWKES CONTINUES STILL SULLEN AND ILL NATURED AND I AM ALMOST AFRAID TO SPEAK TO HER SHE WATCHES ME AS CLOSE AS EVER AND PRETENDS TO WONDER WHY I SHUN HER COMPANY AS I DO
FAR BE IT FROM US TO OFFER VIOLENCE TO YOUR INCLINATION SO MUCH PRUDENCE AS YOU HAVE SHEWN IN ALL YOUR CONDUCT
OF SEEING YOU WITH US WHICH GOD GRANT AMEN AMEN SAY YOUR MOST INDULGENT PARENTS AMEN OUR HUMBLEST SERVICE AND THANKS TO THE WORTHY MISTER WILLIAMS AGAIN WE SAY
BUT OTHERWISE THEY ARE THE DELIGHT OF OUR SPARE HOURS AND WE SHALL READ THEM OVER AND OVER AS LONG AS WE LIVE WITH THANKFULNESS TO GOD WHO HAS GIVEN US SO VIRTUOUS AND SO DISCREET A DAUGHTER
I HAVE JUST PUT UNDER THE TILES THESE LINES INSPIRED BY MY FEARS WHICH ARE INDEED VERY STRONG AND I DOUBT NOT WITHOUT REASON SIR
IF IT BE I WILL LOSE NO TIME TO PROVIDE A HORSE FOR YOU AND ANOTHER FOR MYSELF FOR I CAN NEVER DO EITHER GOD OR MYSELF BETTER SERVICE THOUGH I WERE TO FOREGO ALL MY EXPECTATIONS FOR IT HERE I AM
WHICH HAS ENABLED THEE TO WITHSTAND SO MANY TEMPTATIONS WE HAVE NOT YET HAD LEISURE TO READ THROUGH YOUR LONG ACCOUNTS OF ALL YOUR HARDSHIPS I SAY LONG BECAUSE I WONDER HOW YOU COULD FIND TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM
DILIGENT SEARCH IS MAKING AFTER THE ROGUES MY HUMBLE RESPECTS TO GOOD MISSUS PAMELA IF SHE PITIES MY MISFORTUNES I SHALL BE THE SOONER WELL
AND WHOLLY DIRECTED BY HIM ESPECIALLY AS MY FATHER WHOSE RESPECTS I MENTIONED HAD ASSURED ME MY MASTER WAS SETTING OUT FOR LONDON WHICH HE MUST HAVE SOMEHOW FROM HIS OWN FAMILY OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN ME WORD OF IT
AND SHE RETURNED THE LESS THE BETTER POOR MAN HE HAS GOT BUT LITTLE BY HIS OPENNESS MAKING MISSUS JEWKES HIS CONFIDANT AS SHE BRAGGED
AND TWO OR THREE LETTERS I HAD IN MY POCKETS BY GOOD FORTUNE THE LETTER MISSUS PAMELA GAVE ME WAS IN MY BOSOM AND SO THAT ESCAPED BUT THEY BRUISED MY HEAD AND FACE AND CURSING ME FOR HAVING NO MORE MONEY TIPPED ME INTO THE DAM
AND I AM PERSUADED THAT FEAR BRINGS ONE INTO MORE DANGERS THAN THE CAUTION THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT DELIVERS ONE FROM I THEN LOCKED THE DOOR AND PUT THE KEY IN MY POCKET AND WAS IN A SAD QUANDARY
NOW TO ACCOUNT FOR HER KINDNESS TO MISTER WILLIAMS IN HER VISIT TO HIM WHICH WAS ONLY TO GET OUT OF HIM WHAT SHE COULD WHY MISSUS JEWKES SAID I IS ALL THIS FISHING ABOUT FOR SOMETHING WHERE THERE IS NOTHING
PROVIDENCE WILL NOT DESERT SUCH PIETY AND INNOCENCE AND BE THIS YOUR COMFORT AND RELIANCE
HE WILL LEAVE ME TO MY CHOICE WHY THEN SHOULD I BE AFRAID I WILL GO DOWN AGAIN I THINK BUT YET MY HEART MISGIVES ME BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES BEFORE ME IN ESCAPING
AND YOU CAN PRAY FOR HER WITH HEARTS SO SINCERE AND PURE THAT ARE NOT TO BE MET WITH IN PALACES OH
TO BUY ANY BODY'S CIVILITIES OR TO PAY FOR NECESSARIES OR LODGINGS BUT I'LL GO INTO THE GARDEN AND RESOLVE AFTERWARDS I HAVE BEEN IN THE GARDEN AND TO THE BACK DOOR AND THERE I STOOD
THEY HAVE NOT THE HEARTS OF MICE HE HAS ONLY A FEW SCRATCHES ON HIS FACE WHICH SAID SHE I SUPPOSE HE GOT BY GRAPPLING AMONG THE GRAVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DAM TO TRY TO FIND A HOLE IN THE GROUND TO HIDE HIMSELF FROM THE ROBBERS
AND WITHOUT A HAT AND WIG WHEN HE GOT HOME I WARRANT ADDED SHE
TO BE SURE THERE IS WITCHCRAFT IN THIS HOUSE AND I BELIEVE LUCIFER IS BRIBED AS WELL AS ALL ABOUT ME AND IS GOT INTO THE SHAPE OF THAT NASTY GRIM BULL TO WATCH ME FOR I HAVE BEEN AGAIN AND VENTURED TO OPEN THE DOOR
AND THEN I'LL GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO YOUR CURIOSITY I DON'T CARE SAID SHE WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT FOR I HAVE AS MUCH AS I WANTED FROM HIM
I SAID I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BARBAROUS TO LAUGH AT SUCH A MISFORTUNE BUT SHE REPLIED AS HE WAS SAFE SHE LAUGHED OTHERWISE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY AND SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE ME SO CONCERNED FOR HIM
BUT PRAY DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM AS I SAID FOR HE IS MUCH TOO HEADY AND PRECIPITATE AS TO THIS MATTER IN MY WAY OF THINKING THOUGH TO BE SURE HE IS A VERY GOOD MAN AND I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM
DEAREST MADAM I AM UTTERLY CONFOUNDED AND MUST PLEAD GUILTY TO ALL YOUR JUST REPROACHES I WISH I WERE MASTER OF ALL BUT HALF YOUR CAUTION AND DISCRETION I HOPE AFTER ALL
MISTER WILLIAMS HAS BEEN HERE BUT WE HAVE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TOGETHER HE SEEMED CONFOUNDED AT MISSUS JEWKES'S CHANGE OF TEMPER AND RESERVEDNESS AFTER HER KIND VISIT
WHAT IS IT YOU CANNOT DO FOR YOUR CHILD YOU CAN GIVE HER THE ADVICE SHE HAS SO MUCH WANTED AND STILL WANTS AND WILL ALWAYS WANT YOU CAN CONFIRM HER IN THE PATHS OF VIRTUE INTO WHICH YOU FIRST INITIATED HER
HE HAD FOUND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL MY WATCHFULNESS TO MAKE YOU COME COME SAID SHE NO MORE OF THESE SHAMS WITH ME YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT HEAD PIECE FOR YOUR YEARS BUT MAY BE I AM AS CUNNING AS YOU
IN THE SAME EXCELLENT COURSE AND WE SHALL NOT ENVY THE HIGHEST ESTATE BUT DEFY THEM TO PRODUCE SUCH A DAUGHTER AS OURS I SAID WE HAD NOT READ THROUGH ALL YOURS IN COURSE
TO BOTH WHICH POINTS SHE RETURNED SUSPICIOUS ANSWERS SAYING AS TO THE ONE WHY YOU ARE MIGHTY EARNEST FOR YOUR MONEY I SHAN'T RUN AWAY WITH IT AND TO THE OTHER GOOD LACK YOU NEED NOT BE SO WILLING AS I KNOW OF
BUT THERE STOOD THAT HORRID BULL STARING ME FULL IN THE FACE WITH FIERY SAUCER EYES AS I THOUGHT SO I GOT IN AGAIN FOR FEAR HE SHOULD COME AT ME NOBODY SAW ME HOWEVER
HOWEVER SAID SHE ALL IS WELL NOW BECAUSE MY WATCHMENTS ARE NOW OVER BY MY MASTER'S DIRECTION HOW HAVE YOU EMPLOYED YOURSELF IN MY ABSENCE I WAS SO TROUBLED AT WHAT MIGHT HAVE PASSED BETWEEN MISTER WILLIAMS AND HER
I ASSURED HER AS I COULD DO VERY SAFELY THAT THERE WAS NOT A MAN ON EARTH I WISHED TO HAVE AND AS TO MISTER WILLIAMS HE MIGHT DO BETTER BY FAR AND I HAD PROPOSED SO MUCH HAPPINESS IN LIVING WITH MY POOR FATHER AND MOTHER
AND RECEIVE FROM YOUR OWN LIPS THE BLESSINGS OF SUCH GOOD PARENTS BUT ALAS HOW ARE MY PROSPECTS AGAIN OVERCLOUDED TO WHAT THEY WERE WHEN I CLOSED MY LAST PARCEL
O THIS WICKED WOMAN TO TRICK ME SO EVERY THING MAN WOMAN AND BEAST IS IN A PLOT AGAINST YOUR POOR PAMELA I THINK THEN I KNOW NOT ONE STEP OF THE WAY NOR HOW FAR TO ANY HOUSE OR COTTAGE
I AM MORE AND MORE SATISFIED THERE IS MISCHIEF BREWING AND SHALL BEGIN TO HIDE MY PAPERS AND BE CIRCUMSPECT
STRANGE TEMPTATIONS TO GET AWAY IN HER ABSENCE FOR ALL THESE FINE APPEARANCES TIS SAD TO HAVE NOBODY TO ADVISE WITH I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO BUT ALAS FOR ME I HAVE NO MONEY IF I SHOULD
WITHOUT ANY APPARENT REASON FROM A CONDUCT SO VERY CONTRARY BID ME FEAR THE WORST BLAME ME SIR IF YOU THINK ME WRONG AND LET ME HAVE YOUR ADVICE WHAT TO DO WHICH WILL OBLIGE
THOUGH WITH GREAT PAIN AS I DO THIS TO BE SURE THIS GOOD MAN CAN KEEP NO SECRET AND SENDING IT AWAY BY A MAN AND HORSE THIS MORNING I AM GOOD MISSUS JEWKES YOUR MOST OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT
IT LOOKED PROMISING SHE SAID I HEEDED NOT HER REFLECTIONS
MY SOUL IS OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE WITH THE SOUL OF A PRINCESS THOUGH MY QUALITY IS INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE MEANEST SLAVE SAVE THEN MY INNOCENCE GOOD HEAVEN AND PRESERVE MY MIND SPOTLESS
AND BESIDES I SENT A LETTER AS YOU KNOW BUT HAVE HAD NO ANSWER TO IT SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT THAT HIS LETTER TO MISTER WILLIAMS WAS SUFFICIENT AND THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS TO THANK HIM IF BUT IN TWO LINES
AND HE SEEMED TO TAKE ME AS I INTENDED INTIMATING THE RENEWING OF THE CORRESPONDENCE BY THE TILES
THAT HAD WE BEEN DISPOSED WE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY FOR IT FROM YOUR WATCHFUL CARE AND CIRCUMSPECTION NO SAID SHE THAT'S VERY TRUE MISSUS PAMELA NOT SO MUCH AS FOR THAT DECLARATION THAT HE OWNED BEFORE ME
AND SHE PULLED OUT HER KEY AND WE WALKED A LITTLE IN THE PASTURE TO LOOK AT THE BULL
OUT OF ALL MY PURPOSES O HOW TERRIBLE EVERY THING APPEARS TO ME I HAD GOT TWICE AS FAR AGAIN
AND WHETHER I COULD GAIN PROTECTION IF I GOT TO A HOUSE AND NOW THE ROBBERS ARE ABROAD TOO I MAY RUN INTO AS GREAT DANGER AS I WANT TO ESCAPE NAY GREATER MUCH IF THESE PROMISING APPEARANCES HOLD
AND RETIRED TO MY CLOSET TO WRITE A LETTER FOR THE TILES
ONCE MORE I'LL VENTURE GOD DIRECT MY FOOTSTEPS AND MAKE SMOOTH MY PATH AND MY WAY TO SAFETY WELL HERE I AM COME BACK AGAIN FRIGHTENED LIKE A FOOL
THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE SCRUPLED TO HAVE PROCURED YOUR DELIVERANCE BY ANY MEANS AND THAT I HAD PROPOSED TO YOU AS THE ONLY HONOURABLE ONE MARRIAGE WITH ME BUT I ASSURED HER THOUGH SHE WOULD HARDLY BELIEVE ME
THAT YOU DISCOURAGED MY APPLICATION WHICH IS TOO TRUE
WE HAVE JUST SUPPED TOGETHER ALL THREE AND I CANNOT YET THINK THAT ALL MUST BE RIGHT ONLY I AM RESOLVED NOT TO MARRY IF I CAN HELP IT AND I WILL GIVE NO ENCOURAGEMENT I AM RESOLVED AT LEAST
NOT AT ALL REPLIED SHE BUT I SUPPOSE YOU WILL SOON BE AT LIBERTY TO WALK TOGETHER AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE AND I HAVE SENT A MESSENGER FOR MY LAST INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT THIS AND MORE WEIGHTY MATTERS AND WHEN THEY COME
AND SAW THE BULL AS I THOUGHT BETWEEN ME AND THE DOOR AND ANOTHER BULL COMING TOWARDS ME THE OTHER WAY WELL THOUGHT I HERE IS DOUBLE WITCHCRAFT TO BE SURE HERE IS THE SPIRIT OF MY MASTER IN ONE BULL
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS WITCHES AND SPIRITS IF THERE BE I BELIEVE IN MY HEART MISSUS JEWKES HAS GOT THIS BULL OF HER SIDE BUT YET WHAT COULD I DO WITHOUT MONEY OR A FRIEND'
SHE GAVE NO HINTS OF THE KEY AND THE DOOR ET CETERA
BUT WHICH IS NOT COME TO MY HAND I THINK THERE CAN BE NO TREACHERY FOR IT IS A PARTICULAR FRIEND AT GAINSBOROUGH THAT I HAVE ORDERED HIM TO DIRECT TO AND THIS IS COME SAFE TO MY HANDS BY THIS MEANS
AND THEIR FREEDOM WITH ONE ANOTHER AND MUCH MORE AT WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU HE ASKED IF I WOULD TAKE A TURN IN THE GARDEN WITH MISSUS JEWKES AND HIM NO SAID SHE I CAN'T GO
WELL SAID I LET HIM HAVE SAID WHAT HE WOULD I CARE NOT FOR I AM SURE HE CAN SAY NO HARM OF ME AND SO LET US CHANGE THE TALK I WAS THE EASIER INDEED BECAUSE FOR ALL HER PUMPS
ESPECIALLY AS YOUR LATE LADY'S KINDNESS GAVE YOU SUCH GOOD OPPORTUNITIES WHICH YOU HAVE HAD THE GRACE TO IMPROVE BUT MAY THINK HIMSELF HAPPY IN YOU
AND WAS CONTRIVING BETWEEN YOU TWO THIS ALARMED ME PRODIGIOUSLY AND THE RATHER AS I SAW BY TWO OR THREE INSTANCES THAT HIS HONEST HEART COULD KEEP NOTHING BELIEVING EVERY ONE AS UNDESIGNING AS HIMSELF
THAT I THOUGHT THERE WAS THE HIGHEST REASON TO RESUME OUR PROSPECT OF THE ESCAPE BY THE BACK DOOR I PUT THIS IN THE USUAL PLACE IN THE EVENING AND NOW WAIT WITH IMPATIENCE FOR AN ANSWER THURSDAY I HAVE THE FOLLOWING ANSWER
NO NEED OF IT SAID I FOR I DON'T INTEND TO HAVE MISTER WILLIAMS WHAT THEN IS THAT LETTER TO ME WELL SAID SHE I SEE THOU ART QUITE UNFATHOMABLE I DON'T LIKE ALL THIS
OR TO OFFER TO DIRECT YOU IN YOUR CHOICE BUT ALAS MY CHILD WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU TO PARTAKE OUR HARD LOT AND INVOLVE YOURSELF INTO AS HARD A LIFE WOULD NOT HELP US BUT ADD TO YOUR AFFLICTIONS
WITH REGARD TO THE BETTER PART OF HIS BOUNTY TO ME INCOMPARABLE MISSUS PAMELA THE WICKED BRUTE FELL A LAUGHING WHEN SHE HAD READ THIS LETTER TILL HER FAT SIDES SHOOK SAID SHE
AND SEE AN END TO ALL MY TROUBLES AND ANXIETIES FORGIVE MY IMPATIENCE BUT MY PRESAGING MIND BODES HORRID MISCHIEFS EVERY THING LOOKS DARK AROUND ME AND THIS WOMAN'S IMPENETRABLE SULLENNESS AND SILENCE
SAID HE MAY NOT MISSUS PAMELA TAKE A WALK NO SAID SHE I DESIRE SHE WON'T WHY MISSUS JEWKES SAID HE I AM AFRAID I HAVE SOMEHOW DISOBLIGED YOU
FOR MISSUS JEWKES GIVES ME LEAVE TO SEND A LETTER TO MY FATHER WHICH LOOKS WELL AND I AM GLAD I CAN CONCLUDE AFTER ALL MY SUFFERINGS WITH MY HOPES TO BE SOON WITH YOU WHICH I KNOW WILL GIVE YOU COMFORT AND SO I REST
AND KNOW NOT HOW I GOT HOME I WILL WRITE A LETTER OF THANKS THIS NIGHT IF I AM ABLE TO MY KIND PATRON FOR HIS INESTIMABLE GOODNESS TO ME I WISH I WAS ENABLED TO SAY ALL I HOPE
SHE HAS NOW BEEN ACTUALLY THESE TWO HOURS SHUT UP A WRITING THOUGH SHE PRETENDED SHE HAD GIVEN ME UP ALL HER STORES OF PAPERS ET CETERA AND THAT I SHOULD WRITE FOR HER
MONDAY MORNING ALAS A DAY WE HAVE BAD NEWS FROM POOR MISTER WILLIAMS HE HAS HAD A SAD MISCHANCE FALLEN AMONG ROGUES IN HIS WAY HOME LAST NIGHT BUT BY GOOD CHANCE HAS SAVED MY PAPERS
TO PART WITH ME FOR A BED FELLOW TILL YOU ARE SURE OF ONE YOU LIKE BETTER THIS CUT ME TO THE HEART AND AT THE SAME TIME STOPPED MY MOUTH TUESDAY WEDNESDAY
AS THEY ARE NOT THE EFFECT OF MY OWN VANITY OR PRESUMPTION BUT I WILL PROCEED WITH MY HOPELESS STORY I SAW MISTER WILLIAMS WAS A LITTLE NETTLED AT MY IMPATIENCE AND SO I WROTE TO ASSURE HIM I WOULD BE AS EASY AS I COULD
AND YOUR MASTER'S HEART TURNED TO SEE THE FOLLY OF HIS WAYS AND THE INJURY HE HAD INTENDED TO OUR DEAR CHILD FOR TO BE SURE MY DEAR HE WOULD HAVE RUINED YOU IF HE COULD BUT SEEING YOUR VIRTUE HIS HEART IS TOUCHED
AH MISSUS JEWKES MISSUS JEWKES THIS MIGHT HAVE DONE WITH ME HAD HE HAD ANY THING THAT HE COULD HAVE TOLD YOU OF BUT
THOUGH MISSUS JEWKES IS SOMETIMES A LITTLE HARD UPON ME YET I KNOW NOT WHERE I AM WITHOUT HER I GO UP AND I COME DOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN THE GARDEN AND NOT HAVING HER KNOW SCARCELY WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF AY SAID THE IDEOT
THAT I COULD NOT HIDE IT AND SHE SAID WELL MISSUS PAMELA SINCE ALL MATTERS ARE LIKELY TO BE SO SOON AND SO HAPPILY ENDED LET ME ADVISE YOU TO BE A LITTLE LESS CONCERNED AT HIS DISCOVERIES AND MAKE ME YOUR CONFIDANT
BUT IT IS NOT CANNOT BE IN HIM I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM JOHN ARNOLD IN WHICH HE TELLS ME THAT HIS MASTER IS PREPARING FOR HIS LONDON JOURNEY AND BELIEVES AFTERWARDS HE WILL COME INTO THESE PARTS
GOD BE PRAISED IT IS NO WORSE AND I FIND I HAVE GOT NO COLD THOUGH MISERABLY WET FROM TOP TO TOE MY FRIGHT I BELIEVE PREVENTED ME FROM CATCHING COLD FOR I WAS NOT RIGHTLY MYSELF FOR SOME HOURS
BUT AS EVERY THING IS SO FRIGHTFUL TO ME I FIND I AM NOT FIT TO THINK OF MY ESCAPE
AND BEING SO POOR AND SO FRIENDLESS O GOOD GOD THE PRESERVER OF THE INNOCENT DIRECT ME WHAT TO DO
I THINK YOU ARE TOO APPREHENSIVE BY MUCH I AM SORRY FOR YOUR UNEASINESS YOU MAY DEPEND UPON ME AND ALL I CAN DO BUT I MAKE NO DOUBT OF THE LONDON JOURNEY NOR OF JOHN'S CONTRITION AND FIDELITY
NO FORTUNE TO OUR DEAR CHILD BUT RATHER MUST BE A DISGRACE TO HER AS THE WORLD WILL THINK YET I HOPE I DO NOT SIN IN MY PRIDE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO GOOD MAN OF A COMMON DEGREE
BUT TILL THEN IT IS NO MATTER HOW LITTLE YOU ARE TOGETHER THIS ALARMED US BOTH
SO MISSUS JEWKES IS RETURNED FROM HER VISIT WELL SAID SHE I WOULD HAVE YOU SET YOUR HEART AT REST FOR MISTER WILLIAMS WILL DO VERY WELL AGAIN HE IS NOT HALF SO BAD AS HE FANCIED O THESE SCHOLARS SAID SHE
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FORBORNE GIVING ME A TOUCH OF AND SO WE GAVE UP ONE ANOTHER AS DESPAIRING TO GAIN OUR ENDS OF EACH OTHER BUT I AM SURE HE MUST HAVE SAID MORE THAN HE SHOULD
THIS IS THE ACCOUNT HE GIVES OF IT TO MISSUS JEWKES GOOD MISSUS JEWKES I HAVE HAD A SORE MISFORTUNE IN GOING FROM YOU WHEN I HAD GOT AS NEAR THE TOWN AS THE DAM AND WAS GOING TO CROSS THE WOODEN BRIDGE
SHE SHALL SEND A MESSENGER TO BEDFORDSHIRE AND HE SHALL CARRY A LETTER OF THANKS FOR ME IF I WILL WRITE IT FOR MY MASTER'S FAVOUR TO ME INDEED SAID I I HAVE NO THANKS TO GIVE TILL I AM WITH MY FATHER AND MOTHER
AND IS TO ACCOMPANY HER BROTHER TO LONDON OR MEET HIM THERE HE KNOWS NOT WHICH HE PROFESSES GREAT ZEAL AND AFFECTION TO YOUR SERVICE
FOR WELL I KNOW I DURST TRUST NOTHING TO BRETT AT THE POST HOUSE HERE THIS GIVES ME A LITTLE PAIN BUT I HOPE ALL WILL END WELL AND WE SHALL SOON HEAR IF IT BE NECESSARY TO PURSUE OUR FORMER INTENTIONS
GOOD SAID MY LADY WITH EMPHASIS AND READ ON AGAIN
NAMING NO NAMES AS IF THERE WERE ONLY ONE SHE IN THE WORLD TILL YOU HAD SEEN MORE OF HER AND FORMED YOUR OWN JUDGMENT OF HER
THEY COULDN'T WELTER IN GORE TO SAVE THEIR LIVES WELTERING IN GORE IS A VERY EXPRESSIVE PHRASE CERTAINLY CAN IT BE DONE IN ANY FLUID I WONDER
AND THE GRAVE DOCTOR COLOURED SLIGHTLY AS HE ADDED YES I AGREE WITH YOU SHE IS BEAUTIFUL I QUITE LOST MY HEART TO HER I WENT ON MISCHIEVOUSLY
WASTING NO TIME OVER PRELIMINARIES THE SUB WARDENSHIP IS ABOLISHED AND MY BROTHER IS APPOINTED TO ACT AS VICE WARDEN WHENEVER I AM ABSENT
THIS WAY MY LADY HE ADDED IN A PERFECTLY DIFFERENT TONE IF YOUR LADYSHIP WILL TAKE A SEAT
DON'T YOU BE A GREAT BLETHERING GOOSE
ALL THIS TIME THE SUB WARDEN WAS BUSY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S HELP SHIFTING THE PAPERS FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND POINTING OUT TO THE WARDEN THE PLACE WHEW HE WAS TO SIGN HE THEN SIGNED IT HIMSELF AND MY LADY AND THE CHANCELLOR ADDED THEIR NAMES AS WITNESSES
MY LADY AGAIN CHIMED IN POSSIBLY THERE WAS NO RED HOT POKER HANDY BUT SOME STICKS WERE FORTHCOMING IN A MOMENT AND THREATENING FACES SURROUNDED THE POOR OLD WANDERER WHO WAVED THEM BACK WITH QUIET DIGNITY NO NEED TO BREAK MY OLD BONES HE SAID I AM GOING
PLEASE I'M SYLVIE AND WHO'S THAT OTHER THING SAID THE GARDENER WHAT THING SAID SYLVIE LOOKING ROUND OH THAT'S BRUNO HE'S MY BROTHER
HE REMARKED EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT BUT MY LADY WOULD NOT BE CHECKED HE IS A CLEVER BOY SHE CONTINUED WITH ENTHUSIASM BUT HE NEEDS A MAN LIKE YOUR LORDSHIP TO DRAW HIM OUT THE CHANCELLOR BIT HIS LIP
WELL DONE MY BOY CRIED THE VICE WARDEN THAT'S THE WAY TO SETTLE SUCH FOLK
BRUNO CRIED PASSIONATELY STRUGGLING OUT OF SYLVIE'S ARMS YES
AS HE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE LOCKET NOW SYLVIE LOOK AT THIS AND HE SHOWED HER LYING ON THE PALM OF HIS HAND A LOCKET OF A DEEP CRIMSON COLOUR THE SAME SHAPE AS THE BLUE ONE AND LIKE IT ATTACHED TO A SLENDER GOLDEN CHAIN LOVELIER AND LOVELIER EXCLAIMED SYLVIE
WITH A NOT UNPLEASANT THRILL LIKE WHAT A GOOD GHOST STORY GIVES ONE AT THE UNCANNY COINCIDENCE OF MY HAVING SO UNEXPECTEDLY DIVINED THE SUBJECT OF HER STUDIES IT WAS A BOOK OF DOMESTIC COOKERY OPEN AT THE ARTICLE BREAD SAUCE
IT'S FOR YOU TO KEEP YOU KNOW HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE NOT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE YOU'LL REMEMBER HOW TO USE IT YES I'LL REMEMBER SAID SYLVIE AND NOW DARLINGS IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO BACK OR THEY'LL BE MISSING YOU AND THEN THAT POOR GARDENER WILL GET INTO TROUBLE
BUT IT WAS LIKE GRASPING AIR AND I SOON GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT AND RETURNED TO SYLVIE LOOK WELL AT IT MY DARLING THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING AND TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE IT
ONCE MORE A FEELING OF WONDER ROSE IN MY MIND AS TO HOW IN THE WORLD WE WERE TO GET BACK AGAIN SINCE I TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT WHEREVER THE CHILDREN WENT I WAS TO GO
I FEEL INCLINED TO SAY WITH ALEXANDER SELKIRK
CROSSING THE ROOM AND OPENING A CUPBOARD FROM WHICH SHE PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH TWO SLICES OF PLUM CAKE EAT AND DON'T CRY WERE HER SHORT AND SIMPLE ORDERS AND THE POOR CHILDREN SAT DOWN SIDE BY SIDE BUT SEEMED IN NO MOOD FOR EATING FOR THE SECOND TIME THE DOOR OPENED
BUT WHAT'S THE DIFFICULTY SAID MY LADY WHY DON'T YOU SEE THE AMBASSADOR THAT BROUGHT THIS IS WAITING IN THE HOUSE AND HE'S SURE TO SEE SYLVIE AND BRUNO AND THEN WHEN HE SEES UGGUG AND REMEMBERS ALL THAT ABOUT
YOU'RE RIGHT MY DEAR
THE LINES CAME TO MY LIPS FROM SACKCLOTH COUCH THE MONK AROSE
THREE SCORE YEARS AND TEN BALDNESS AND SPECTACLES HAVE THEIR ADVANTAGES AFTER ALL I SAID TO MYSELF INSTEAD OF A BASHFUL YOUTH AND MAIDEN GASPING OUT MONOSYLLABLES AT AWFUL INTERVALS
SO AS I AM GOING ABROAD FOR A WHILE HE WILL ENTER ON HIS NEW DUTIES AT ONCE AND THERE WILL REALLY BE A VICE AFTER ALL MY LADY ENQUIRED I HOPE SO THE WARDEN SMILINGLY REPLIED MY LADY LOOKED MUCH PLEASED
I HOPE I DIDN'T FRIGHTEN YOU I STAMMERED OUT AT LAST I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I SAID I WAS DREAMING YOU SAID UGGUG INDEED THE YOUNG LADY REPLIED WITH QUIVERING LIPS THAT WOULD CURVE THEMSELVES INTO A SMILE
BUT THE BOOKLETS THE LITTLE THRILLING ROMANCES WHERE THE MURDER COMES AT PAGE FIFTEEN AND THE WEDDING AT PAGE FORTY SURELY THEY ARE DUE TO STEAM AND WHEN WE TRAVEL BY ELECTRICITY IF I MAY VENTURE TO DEVELOP YOUR THEORY WE SHALL HAVE LEAFLETS INSTEAD OF BOOKLETS
A DEVELOPMENT WORTHY OF DARWIN THE LADY EXCLAIMED ENTHUSIASTICALLY ONLY YOU REVERSE HIS THEORY
AND THEN MADE HER DECISION IT'S VERY NICE TO BE LOVED SHE SAID BUT IT'S NICER TO LOVE OTHER PEOPLE
A GARDENER HE SEEMED TO BE YET SURELY A MAD ONE BY THE WAY HE BRANDISHED HIS RAKE MADDER BY THE WAY HE BROKE EVER AND ANON INTO A FRANTIC JIG
BUT DON'T THROW IT OUT HE'S GONE AWAY DON'T YOU SEE LET'S GO AFTER HIM
TAKE A STICK TO HIM SHOUTED THE VICE WARDEN AS THE OLD BEGGAR SHOOK THE WATER FROM HIS RAGGED CLOAK AND AGAIN GAZED MEEKLY UPWARDS
I EXCLAIMED IN A BURST OF INDIGNATION I COULD NO LONGER CONTROL TO BRING OUT EVEN THAT ONE WORD SEEMED A GIGANTIC EFFORT
FOR INSTANCE YOU MIGHT WELTER IN BREAD SAUCE THAT BEING WHITE WOULD BE MORE SUITABLE FOR A GHOST
I COULD BUT RUB MY EYES AND SAY WHERE THEN ARE THE RAGS GONE TO FOR THE OLD MAN WAS NOW DRESSED IN ROYAL ROBES THAT GLITTERED WITH JEWELS AND GOLD EMBROIDERY
IT'LL DO NO HARM AND WHEN
WELL YOU DO LOOK A BIT PULLED DOWN AND HE PUT ON A SOLEMN PROFESSIONAL AIR I PRESCRIBE OZONE QUANT SUFF SOCIAL DISSIPATION
HE ISN'T INDEED MY LADY WAS APPEASED
SHOULD IT NOT BE READ OUT FIRST MY LADY ENQUIRED NO NEED NO NEED
AND BEGAN COMPARING THE TWO AGREEMENTS ITEM THAT HE SHALL EXERCISE THE AUTHORITY OF WARDEN IN THE WARDEN'S ABSENCE WHY THAT'S BEEN CHANGED INTO SHALL BE ABSOLUTE GOVERNOR FOR LIFE WITH THE TITLE OF EMPEROR IF ELECTED TO THAT OFFICE BY THE PEOPLE
I MOVED AWAY A FEW STEPS AND WAITED TO FOLLOW HER INTO THE CARRIAGE WHERE I RESUMED THE CONVERSATION
LOVE SYLVIE HE MADE THEM OUT AT LAST AND SO THEY DOOS HE CRIED CLASPING HIS ARMS ROUND HER NECK EVERYBODY LOVES SYLVIE BUT WE LOVE HER BEST DON'T WE BRUNO SAID THE OLD KING
AND I LEANED BACK DROWSILY IN MY EASY CHAIR FILLED WITH BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL IMAGININGS OF ARTHUR AND HIS LADY LOVE
BUT WHAT IT WAS SHE HAD YET TO LEARN YOU SAID I SHOULD HEAR ALL ABOUT IT WHEN THE WARDEN HAD GONE SHE REMARKED AS SOON AS SHE COULD MAKE HERSELF HEARD AND SO YOU SHALL TABBY HER HUSBAND GRACIOUSLY REPLIED AS HE REMOVED THE BLOTTING PAPER
AND WE THEREFORE ENTREAT YOU GRACIOUSLY TO ACCEPT THE KINGSHIP
ALL WAS THE INNOCENT FRANKNESS OF SOME ANGELIC VISITANT NEW TO THE WAYS OF EARTH AND THE CONVENTIONALISMS OR IF YOU WILL THE BARBARISMS OF SOCIETY EVEN SO I MUSED WILL SYLVIE LOOK AND SPEAK IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS
ALL NOW YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE SAID THE OLD MAN DIFFERENT COLOURS AND DIFFERENT WORDS
AND AM I VICE WARDENESS IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THAT TITLE SAID THE WARDEN
YOU HAVE A REAL GOOD TERRIFYING GHOST IN THAT BOOK I HINTED HOW COULD YOU GUESS SHE EXCLAIMED WITH THE MOST ENGAGING FRANKNESS AND PLACED THE VOLUME IN MY HANDS I OPENED IT EAGERLY
WHICH ROOM IS HE WAITING IN SHE INQUIRED IN THE LIBRARY MADAM AND WHAT DID YOU SAY HIS NAME WAS SAID THE VICE WARDEN
THEN TO MY SURPRISE THEY BROKE INTO PEALS OF UNCONTROLLABLE LAUGHTER
TO BE TAKEN FEASTING THREE TIMES A DAY BUT DOCTOR I REMONSTRATED
BUT LOOKED SADLY ILL AND WORN A CRUST OF BREAD IS WHAT I CRAVE HE REPEATED A SINGLE CRUST AND A LITTLE WATER HERE'S SOME WATER DRINK THIS
AND MAKING ROOM AMONG THEM FOR THE ONE THE WARDEN HAD JUST HANDED TO HIM THESE ARE MERELY THE ROUGH COPIES HE EXPLAINED AND AS SOON AS I HAVE PUT IN THE FINAL CORRECTIONS MAKING A GREAT COMMOTION AMONG THE DIFFERENT PARCHMENTS A SEMI COLON OR TWO THAT I HAVE ACCIDENTALLY OMITTED
IF STEAM HAS DONE NOTHING ELSE IT HAS AT LEAST ADDED A WHOLE NEW SPECIES TO ENGLISH LITERATURE NO DOUBT OF IT I ECHOED THE TRUE ORIGIN OF ALL OUR MEDICAL BOOKS AND ALL OUR COOKERY BOOKS
I RETURNED THE BOOK LOOKING I SUPPOSE A LITTLE BLANK AS THE LADY LAUGHED MERRILY AT MY DISCOMFITURE IT'S FAR MORE EXCITING THAN SOME OF THE MODERN GHOSTS I ASSURE YOU NOW THERE WAS A GHOST LAST MONTH
IN A SMOCK FROCK WHO SAT WITH ROUNDED SHOULDERS AND DROOPING HEAD AND WITH HANDS CLASPED ON THE TOP OF HIS STICK SO AS TO MAKE A SORT OF PILLOW FOR THAT WRINKLED FACE WITH ITS LOOK OF PATIENT WEARINESS COME YOU BE OFF THE STATION MASTER ROUGHLY ACCOSTED THE POOR OLD MAN
BUT SYLVIE HASN'T GOT THAT CALM RESOLUTE MOUTH NOR THAT FAR AWAY LOOK OF DREAMY SADNESS LIKE ONE THAT HAS HAD SOME DEEP SORROW VERY LONG AGO AND THE THICK COMING FANCIES ALMOST PREVENTED MY HEARING THE LADY'S NEXT WORDS
I'LL MAKE HIM BELIEVE UGGUG TO BE A MODEL OF CLEVERNESS AND ALL THAT
THEN SYLVIE ADVANCED ALONE BRUNO HAVING SUDDENLY TURNED SHY
ALL OF US EXCEPT SYLVIE AND BRUNO WHO TOOK NO NOTICE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON FOLLOWED HER TO THE WINDOW THE OLD BEGGAR LOOKED UP AT US WITH HUNGRY EYES
BRUNO WAS AT THE WINDOW TRYING TO THROW OUT HIS SLICE OF PLUM CAKE BUT SYLVIE HELD HIM BACK
AND WAS SILENT HE EVIDENTLY FEARED THAT STUPID AS SHE LOOKED SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHE SAID THIS TIME AND WAS HAVING A JOKE AT HIS EXPENSE HE MIGHT HAVE SPARED HIMSELF ALL ANXIETY WHATEVER ACCIDENTAL MEANING HER WORDS MIGHT HAVE SHE HERSELF NEVER MEANT ANYTHING AT ALL
HERE HE DARTED ABOUT PEN IN HAND FROM ONE PART OF THE SCROLL TO ANOTHER SPREADING SHEETS OF BLOTTING PAPER OVER HIS CORRECTIONS
I SUPPOSE NOW THAT WORD ITEM HAS SOME DEEP LEGAL MEANING UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED THE CHANCELLOR AS ARTICULATELY AS HE COULD WITH A PEN BETWEEN HIS LIPS HE WAS NERVOUSLY ROLLING AND UNROLLING SEVERAL OTHER SCROLLS
AND TRIED TO CLAP HER HANDS BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE KNOCKED TWO FEATHER BEDS TOGETHER FOR ANY NOISE IT MADE WHEN MY HUSBAND IS VICE SHE SAID IT WILL BE THE SAME AS IF WE HAD A HUNDRED VICES HEAR HEAR CRIED THE SUB WARDEN
THAT HE HAD THE FEET OF AN ELEPHANT BUT THE REST OF HIM WAS SKIN AND BONE AND THE WISPS OF LOOSE STRAW THAT BRISTLED ALL ABOUT HIM SUGGESTED THAT HE HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY STUFFED WITH IT AND THAT NEARLY ALL THE STUFFING HAD COME OUT
AND I KNOW SOME OF THE LADY SOCIETY ALREADY I ADDED ONE OF THEM CAME IN THE SAME CARRIAGE WITH ME WHAT WAS SHE LIKE THEN PERHAPS I CAN IDENTIFY HER THE NAME WAS LADY MURIEL ORME
AND WE SOON FOUND OURSELVES WITH ALL OUR PORTABLE PROPERTY AROUND US ON THE PLATFORM THE ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED FOR PASSENGERS WAITING AT THIS JUNCTION WAS DISTINCTLY INADEQUATE A SINGLE WOODEN BENCH APPARENTLY INTENDED FOR THREE SITTERS ONLY
A HEART SHAPED LOCKET APPARENTLY CUT OUT OF A SINGLE JEWEL OF A RICH BLUE COLOUR WITH A SLENDER GOLD CHAIN ATTACHED TO IT IT ARE WELLY PRETTY
BUT I CAN TRUST YOU WITH A SECRET OLD FRIEND YES IT'S TRUE OF ME WHAT I SUPPOSE YOU SAID IN JEST IN THE MEREST JEST BELIEVE ME I SAID EARNESTLY WHY MAN I'M THREE TIMES HER AGE
HERE WE HAVE AN OLD MAN AND A CHILD QUITE AT THEIR EASE TALKING AS IF THEY HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS THEN YOU THINK I CONTINUED ALOUD THAT WE OUGHT SOMETIMES TO ASK A GHOST TO SIT DOWN BUT HAVE WE ANY AUTHORITY FOR IT
YOUR HUSBAND AND I HAVE GONE THROUGH IT TOGETHER IT PROVIDES THAT HE SHALL EXERCISE THE FULL AUTHORITY OF WARDEN
HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ELEPHANT THAT PRACTISED ON A FIFE HE LOOKED AGAIN AND FOUND IT WAS A LETTER FROM HIS WIFE AT LENGTH I REALISE HE SAID THE BITTERNESS OF LIFE AND WHAT A WILD BEING IT WAS WHO SANG THESE WILD WORDS
SHORT PARTINGS ARE BEST SAID THE WARDEN ALL IS READY FOR MY JOURNEY MY CHILDREN ARE WAITING BELOW TO SEE ME OFF HE GRAVELY KISSED MY LADY SHOOK HANDS WITH HIS BROTHER AND THE CHANCELLOR
HE MAKES HAMLET SAY REST REST PERTURBED SPIRIT AND THAT I SUPPOSE MEANS AN EASY CHAIR AN AMERICAN ROCKING CHAIR I THINK FAYFIELD JUNCTION MY LADY CHANGE FOR ELVESTON THE GUARD ANNOUNCED FLINGING OPEN THE DOOR OF THE CARRIAGE
AT HOME LAWN TENNIS THREE P M AT HOME KETTLEDRUM FIVE P M AT HOME MUSIC ELVESTON DOESN'T GIVE DINNERS EIGHT P M CARRIAGES AT TEN THERE YOU ARE IT SOUNDED VERY PLEASANT I WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT
HUMPH NO HE SAID MUSINGLY WOULDN'T DO
AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T SAY IT YOU SHOUTED IT I'M VERY SORRY WAS ALL I COULD SAY FEELING VERY PENITENT AND HELPLESS SHE HAS SYLVIE'S EYES I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
A CUNNING CONSPIRACY THE WARDEN ENTERED AT THIS MOMENT AND CLOSE BEHIND HIM CAME THE LORD CHANCELLOR
AND HE AND THE VICE WARDEN JOINED HANDS AND SKIPPED WILDLY ABOUT THE ROOM MY LADY WAS TOO DIGNIFIED TO SKIP BUT SHE LAUGHED LIKE THE NEIGHING OF A HORSE AND WAVED HER HANDKERCHIEF ABOVE HER HEAD IT WAS CLEAR TO HER VERY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING THAT SOMETHING VERY CLEVER HAD BEEN DONE
AND HE STEADILY RESISTED ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT OF LADY MURIEL UNTIL THE EVENING HAD ALMOST WORN ITSELF AWAY THEN AS WE SAT GAZING INTO THE FIRE AND CONVERSATION WAS LAPSING INTO SILENCE HE MADE A HURRIED CONFESSION
THE CHANCELLOR CHUCKLED JUST THE SAME WORD FOR WORD HE SAID WITH ONE EXCEPTION MY LADY INSTEAD OF BRUNO I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY TO PUT IN
AND SYLVIE AND BRUNO CAME IN WITH THEIR ARMS TWINED LOVINGLY ROUND EACH OTHER BRUNO SOBBING CONVULSIVELY WITH HIS FACE HIDDEN ON HIS SISTER'S SHOULDER AND SYLVIE MORE GRAVE AND QUIET
THE PLEASURE WE ALL SEEK SO MADLY AND ENJOY SO MOURNFULLY BRUNO RAN EAGERLY TO THE WALL AND PICKED A FRUIT THAT WAS SHAPED SOMETHING LIKE A BANANA BUT HAD THE COLOUR OF A STRAWBERRY HE ATE IT WITH BEAMING LOOKS THAT BECAME GRADUALLY MORE GLOOMY AND WERE VERY BLANK INDEED BY THE TIME HE HAD FINISHED
WE MUST SPREAD A REPORT OF HIS DEATH A LITTLE CONSPIRACY A CONSPIRACY CRIED THE DELIGHTED LADY CLAPPING HER HANDS OF ALL THINGS I DO LIKE A CONSPIRACY IT'S SO INTERESTING
ALL THE JEWELS ONLY THINK MAY I GO AND PUT THEM ON DIRECTLY WELL NOT JUST YET LOVEY HER HUSBAND UNEASILY REPLIED
I PICTURED THEM TO MYSELF WALKING TOGETHER LINGERINGLY AND LOVINGLY UNDER ARCHING TREES IN A SWEET GARDEN OF THEIR OWN AND WELCOMED BACK BY THEIR FAITHFUL GARDENER ON THEIR RETURN FROM SOME BRIEF EXCURSION
OR FAILING THAT UNTIL BRUNO COMES OF AGE AND THAT HE SHALL THEN HAND OVER TO MYSELF OR TO BRUNO AS THE CASE MAY BE THE WARDENSHIP THE UNSPENT REVENUE AND THE CONTENTS OF THE TREASURY WHICH ARE TO BE PRESERVED INTACT UNDER HIS GUARDIANSHIP
FOR AN ENTIRELY STUPID WOMAN MY LADY'S REMARKS WERE CURIOUSLY FULL OF MEANING OF WHICH SHE HERSELF WAS WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS THE CHANCELLOR BOWED BUT WITH A VERY UNEASY AIR
WE MUST FEEL OUR WAY OF COURSE WE'LL HAVE THE COACH AND FOUR OUT AT ONCE AND I'LL TAKE THE TITLE OF EMPEROR AS SOON AS WE CAN SAFELY HOLD AN ELECTION BUT THEY'LL HARDLY STAND OUR USING THE JEWELS AS LONG AS THEY KNOW THE WARDEN'S ALIVE
WHAT ARE YOU EMPEROR DARLING NOT YET DEAR THE VICE WARDEN REPLIED IT WON'T DO TO LET THIS PAPER BE SEEN JUST AT PRESENT ALL IN GOOD TIME MY LADY NODDED AND READ ON ITEM THAT WE WILL BE KIND TO THE POOR
PERTURBED SPIRIT IS SUCH A HAPPY PHRASE PERTURBED REFERRING NO DOUBT SHE REJOINED
BECAUSE YOU DON'T BELONG TO ELFLAND YET BUT TO ME THEY ARE REAL BRUNO LOOKED PUZZLED I'LL TRY ANUVVER KIND OF FRUITS HE SAID AND JUMPED DOWN OFF THE KING'S KNEE THERE'S SOME LOVELY STRIPED ONES JUST LIKE A RAINBOW AND OFF HE RAN
HE'S JUST UNDER HERE SAID UGGUG WHO HAD GONE TO THE WINDOW AND WAS LOOKING DOWN INTO THE COURT YARD
MUSTN'T CRY LIKE THAT THE VICE WARDEN SAID SHARPLY BUT WITHOUT ANY EFFECT ON THE WEEPING CHILDREN CHEER EM UP A BIT HE HINTED TO MY LADY CAKE MY LADY MUTTERED TO HERSELF WITH GREAT DECISION
BUT I COULD SEE HIS EYES FILL WITH TEARS AS HE BENT HIS HEAD AND PRESSED HIS LIPS TO HER FOREHEAD IN A LONG LOVING KISS
TO THE ADDRESS LEGIBLE ON THE PILE OF LUGGAGE WHICH ANNOUNCED THEIR OWNER TO BE LADY MURIEL ORME PASSENGER TO ELVESTON VIA FAYFIELD JUNCTION AS I WATCHED THE OLD MAN SLOWLY RISE TO HIS FEET AND HOBBLE A FEW PACES DOWN THE PLATFORM
THE LADY LOOKED PUZZLED AND THOUGHTFUL FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE ALMOST CLAPPED HER HANDS
FROM WHICH THE LUGGAGE WAS BEING TAKEN OUT AND AFTER GIVING DIRECTIONS TO HAVE MY BOXES SENT AFTER ME I MADE MY WAY ON FOOT TO ARTHUR'S LODGINGS AND SOON LOST MY LONELY FEELING IN THE HEARTY WELCOME MY OLD FRIEND GAVE ME
HE UNROLLED A LARGE PARCHMENT SCROLL AND READ ALOUD THE WORDS ITEM THAT WE WILL BE KIND TO THE POOR THE CHANCELLOR WORDED IT FOR ME HE ADDED GLANCING AT THAT GREAT FUNCTIONARY
LESS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD SHOW IT BY SUCH WILD DANCES SUCH CRAZY SONGS
HE'S NOT TO HAVE ANY FOOD THE VICE WARDEN WAS BEGINNING BUT THE CHANCELLOR INTERRUPTED HIM
IN A HANDSOME LIVERY CAME FORWARDS AND RESPECTFULLY TOUCHED HIS HAT THE CARRIAGE IS HERE MY LADY HE SAID TAKING FROM HER THE WRAPS AND SMALL ARTICLES SHE WAS CARRYING
YOU DON'T CARE FOR GHOSTS THEN I VENTURED TO SUGGEST UNLESS THEY ARE REALLY TERRIFYING QUITE SO THE LADY ASSENTED THE REGULAR RAILWAY GHOSTS I MEAN THE GHOSTS OF ORDINARY RAILWAY LITERATURE
SOMETHING ABOUT GHOSTS OR DYNAMITE OR MIDNIGHT MURDER ONE COULD UNDERSTAND IT THOSE THINGS AREN'T WORTH THE SHILLING UNLESS THEY GIVE ONE A NIGHTMARE BUT REALLY WITH ONLY A MEDICAL TREATISE YOU KNOW AND SHE GLANCED WITH A PRETTY SHRUG OF CONTEMPT AT THE BOOK OVER WHICH I HAD FALLEN ASLEEP
BUT WHERE IS MY PRECIOUS CHILD MY LADY ENQUIRED AS THE FOUR TOOK THEIR SEATS AT THE SMALL SIDE TABLE DEVOTED TO LEDGERS AND BUNDLES AND BILLS HE LEFT THE ROOM A FEW MINUTES AGO WITH THE LORD CHANCELLOR THE SUB WARDEN BRIEFLY EXPLAINED
AND SHOWED THE TWO PARCHMENTS LYING SIDE BY SIDE THIS IS THE ONE HE READ BUT DIDN'T SIGN AND THIS IS THE ONE HE SIGNED BUT DIDN'T READ
THE CONSPIRATORS RETURNED TO THEIR SEATS AND CONTINUED THEIR CONVERSATION IN AN UNDERTONE SO AS NOT TO BE HEARD BY UGGUG WHO WAS STILL STANDING AT THE WINDOW BY THE WAY
HER FRIENDLINESS AND UTTER UNRESERVE TOOK ME ABACK FOR A MOMENT YET THERE WAS NO TOUCH OF FORWARDNESS OR BOLDNESS ABOUT THE CHILD FOR CHILD ALMOST SHE SEEMED TO BE I GUESSED HER AT SCARCELY OVER TWENTY
I THOUGHT I SAW I MURMURED SLEEPILY AND THEN THE PHRASE INSISTED ON CONJUGATING ITSELF AND RAN INTO YOU THOUGHT YOU SAW HE THOUGHT HE SAW AND THEN IT SUDDENLY WENT OFF INTO A SONG
HARD WORD SYLVIE IT WAS A PHLIZZ SYLVIE GRAVELY REPLIED
MEANWHILE THE FAIRY KING AND SYLVIE WERE TALKING TOGETHER BUT IN SUCH LOW TONES THAT I COULD NOT CATCH THE WORDS
AND YET IT CAN HARDLY BE CALLED EXPLORATION PROPER HE VISITED PLACES WHICH HAD BEEN SETTLED AND INHABITED FOR CENTURIES AND TRAVERSED PLACES WHICH HAD BEEN TRAVELLED BY CIVILIZED MEN FOR YEARS BEFORE HE FOLLOWED IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS
MODERN SCIENTISTS LIKE MODERN HISTORIANS AND ABOVE ALL SCIENTIFIC AND HISTORICAL EDUCATORS SHOULD EVER KEEP IN MIND THAT CLEARNESS OF SPEECH AND WRITING IS ESSENTIAL TO CLEARNESS OF THOUGHT AND THAT A SIMPLE CLEAR
NO MORE QUALIFIES A MAN TO SPEAK OF OR TO TAKE PART IN EXPLORING UNKNOWN SOUTH AMERICAN RIVERS THAN A TRIP ON THE LOWER SAINT LAWRENCE QUALIFIES A MAN TO REGARD HIMSELF AS AN EXPERT IN A CANOE VOYAGE ACROSS LABRADOR
AT LEAST HE CAN IF HE CHOOSES GO OVER HIS SENTENCES UNTIL HE IS REASONABLY SURE THAT THEY CAN BE PARSED HE CAN TAKE PAINS TO SEE THAT HIS WHOLE THOUGHT IS EXPRESSED
OR THE BALKAN STATES IS DIFFICULT MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE A TASTE FOR TRAVEL IN OUT OF WAY PLACES AND WHO THEREFORE DO NOT MIND SLIGHT DISCOMFORTS AND INCONVENIENCES HAVE THE CHANCE THEMSELVES TO ENJOY AND TO MAKE OTHERS PROFIT BY
AND THERE IS NOTHING MORE NEEDED AT THE PRESENT MOMENT AMONG OUR SCIENTIFIC MEN THAN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SCHOOL OF MEN WHO WHILE INDUSTRIOUS AND MINUTE OBSERVERS AND COLLECTORS AND CAUTIOUS GENERALIZERS
MORE REMAINS TO BE DONE IN THE WAY OF PIONEER EXPLORING AND OF SCIENTIFIC WORK IN THE GREAT STRETCHES OF VIRGIN WILDERNESS THE ONLY TWO OTHER CONTINENTS WHERE SUCH WORK OF LIKE VOLUME AND VALUE REMAINS TO BE DONE ARE AFRICA AND ASIA
HE ADDS A RARE POWER TO DRAW WITH BOTH CAUTION AND ORIGINALITY THE NECESSARY GENERAL CONCLUSIONS FROM THE RESULTS OF HIS OWN OBSERVATIONS AND FROM THE RECORDED STUDIES OF OTHER MEN
HE LIVED AN EXCEEDINGLY ISOLATED PRIMITIVE AND LABORIOUS LIFE FOR ELEVEN YEARS NOW HALF A CENTURY AFTER IT WAS WRITTEN HIS NATURALIST ON THE AMAZON IS AS INTERESTING AND VALUABLE AS IT EVER WAS
OF COURSE SUCH A TRIP REPRESENTS TRAVELLING OF ESSENTIALLY THE SAME KIND AS TRAVELLING BY RAILROAD FROM ATLANTA TO CALGARY OR FROM MADRID TO MOSCOW NEXT THERE ARE THE TRAVELLERS WHO VISIT THE LONG SETTLED DISTRICTS AND COLONIAL CITIES OF THE INTERIOR
THIS IS A TRIP WELL WORTH TAKING BY ALL INTELLIGENT MEN AND WOMEN WHO CAN AFFORD IT AND IT IS BEING TAKEN BY SUCH MEN AND WOMEN WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IT ENTAILS NO MORE DIFFICULTY THAN A SIMILAR TRIP TO THE MEDITERRANEAN
BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT HE STUDIED AT FIRST HAND MANY OTHER MORE OR LESS KINDRED SUBJECTS AS MAY BE SEEN IN HIS REMARKS ON THE INDIANS AND IN HIS EXCELLENT PAMPHLET ON SOME FACTORS OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN SOUTH AMERICA
THERE HAS BEEN FOR INSTANCE A RECENT VOGUE FOR THE EXTENSIVE MISUSE USUALLY TAUTOLOGICAL MISUSE OF THE WORD COMPLEXUS AN EXCELLENT WORD IF USED RARELY AND FOR DEFINITE PURPOSES
IN ADDITION TO VALUABLE INVESTIGATIONS OF FOSSIL BEARING BEDS IN THE ARGENTINE HE MADE SOME EXCELLENT GENERAL SUGGESTIONS SUCH AS THAT THE PITHECOID APES LIKE THE BABOONS DO NOT STAND IN THE LINE OF MAN'S ANCESTRAL STEM
FURTHER RESEARCH CAREFUL ACCURATE AND LONG EXTENDED CAN ALONE ENABLE US TO DECIDE DEFINITELY IN THE MATTER
FOR INSTANCE BETWEEN PATAGONIA AND AUSTRALIA OR BETWEEN BRAZIL AND SOUTH AFRICA OR BETWEEN THE WEST INDIES AND THE MEDITERRANEAN OR BETWEEN A PART OF THE ANDEAN REGION AND NORTHEASTERN ASIA
ABOUT BACKWARD COUNTRY FOLK KINDLY OR THE REVERSE WHO SHOW A MIXTURE OF THE IDEAS OF SAVAGERY WITH THE IDEAS OF AN ANCIENT PEASANTRY AND ABOUT ROUGH OLD HIGHWAYS OF TRAVEL WHICH IN COMFORT DO NOT DIFFER MUCH FROM THOSE OF MEDIAEVAL EUROPE
AND THAT THE ANCESTRAL TYPES OF MODERN MAMMALS AND OF MAN HIMSELF WANDERED ACROSS ONE OF THESE BRIDGES TO THE OLD WORLD AND THAT THENCE THEIR REMOTE DESCENDANTS AFTER AGES OF TIME RETURNED TO THE NEW
BATES CAME TO THE AMAZON JUST BEFORE THE ERA OF AMAZONIAN STEAMBOATS HE NEVER WENT OFF THE NATIVE ROUTES OF ORDINARY TRAVEL BUT HE WAS A DEVOTED AND ABLE NATURALIST
TO MY MIND HE HAS ESTABLISHED A STRONGER PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF THE THEORY HE CHAMPIONS THAN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN FAVOR OF THE THEORIES OF ANY OF THE LEARNED AND ABLE SCIENTIFIC MEN FROM WHOSE CONCLUSIONS HE DISSENTS
FIRST THERE ARE THE TRAVELLERS WHO SKIRT THE CONTINENT IN COMFORTABLE STEAMERS GOING FROM ONE GREAT SEAPORT TO ANOTHER AND OCCASIONALLY TAKING A SHORT RAILWAY JOURNEY TO SOME BIG INTERIOR CITY NOT TOO FAR FROM THE COAST
CONCLUDE THAT AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE UNITED STATES AND ALMOST EVERY OTHER PORTION OF THE EARTH WERE CONNECTED BY LAND AND SEVERED FROM ALL OTHER REGIONS BY WATER AND FROM THE STUDY OF CERTAIN OTHER GROUPS OF ANIMALS
EXACTLY AS A GOOD ARCHAEOLOGIST MAY NOT BE COMPETENT TO SPEAK OF CURRENT SOCIAL OR POLITICAL PROBLEMS SO A MAN WHO HAS DONE CAPITAL WORK AS A TOURIST OBSERVER IN LITTLE VISITED CITIES AND ALONG REMOTE HIGHWAYS
THE TRAVELLERS WHO GO UP OR DOWN THE HIGHWAY RIVERS THAT HAVE BEEN TRAVELLED FOR FROM ONE TO FOUR HUNDRED YEARS RIVERS LIKE THE PARAGUAY AND PARANA THE AMAZON THE TAPAJOS THE MADEIRA THE LOWER ORINOCO
WERE OF MUCH GREATER AGE THAN THE STRATA WITH CORRESPONDING REMAINS ELSEWHERE THAT IN SOUTH AMERICA VARIOUS SPECIES AND GENERA OF MEN EXISTED IN TERTIARY TIMES
IN OTHER WORDS THE MOST DIFFICULT AND THEREFORE ORDINARILY THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES OF FIRST HAND EXPLORATION ARE PRECISELY THOSE WHERE THE SCIENTIFIC WORK OF THE ACCOMPANYING CARTOGRAPHER GEOLOGIST BOTANIST AND ZOOLOGIST
AMEGHINO RENDERED MARKED SERVICES TO PALEONTOLOGY BUT HE GENERALIZED WITH COMPLETE RECKLESSNESS FROM THE SLENDEREST DATA AND EVEN THESE DATA HE OFTEN COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTOOD OR MISINTERPRETED
BUT REPRESENT A DIVERGENCE FROM IT AWAY FROM HUMANITY AND TOWARD A RETROGRESSIVE BESTIALIZATION BUT OF HIS MAIN THESES HE PROVES NONE AND WHAT EVIDENCE WE HAVE TELLS AGAINST THEM
ON THE HEADWATERS OF THE XINGU AND HERE AND THERE ALONG THE EASTERN BASE OF THE ANDES BUT AS A RULE THE WORK MUST BE SPECIALIZED AND IN ITS FINAL SHAPE IT MUST BE SPECIALIZED EVERYWHERE
IT IS MORE TRUE OF THE EXPLORATION WHICH MUST IN SOUTH AMERICA BECOME INCREASINGLY NECESSARY DONE ACROSS COUNTRY AWAY FROM THE RIVERS THE SCIENTIFIC WORK PROPER OF THESE EARLY EXPLORERS MUST BE OF A SOMEWHAT PRELIMINARY NATURE
SURELY IF HE WILL TAKE AS MUCH PAINS WITH HIS WRITING AS HE HAS WITH THE FAR MORE DIFFICULT BUSINESS OF EXPLORING AND COLLECTING HE WILL BECOME ABLE TO EXPRESS HIS THOUGHT CLEARLY AND FORCEFULLY
USE COMPLEXUS IN MUCH THE SAME SPIRIT AS THAT DISPLAYED BY THE FAMOUS OLD LADY WHO DERIVED RELIGIOUS INSTEAD OF SCIENTIFIC CONSOLATION FROM THE USE OF
OVER A LARGE EXTENT OF SOUTH AMERICAN TERRITORY HITHERTO ONLY PARTIALLY KNOWN OR QUITE UNEXPLORED HASEMAN'S PRIMARY OBJECT WAS TO STUDY THE CHARACTERISTICS AND DISTRIBUTION OF SOUTH AMERICAN FISHES
AT THE MUSEUM OF LA PLATA I FOUND THAT THE AUTHORITIES WERE PRACTICALLY A UNIT IN REGARDING HIS REMAINS OF TERTIARY MEN AND PROTO MEN
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THREE GREAT CONTINENTAL MASSES SOMETIMES SOLID SOMETIMES BROKEN EXTENDING SOUTHWARD FROM THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AND FROM TIME TO TIME CONNECTED IN THE NORTH
TRAVELLING OVER LAND OR RIVER HIGHWAYS WHICH HAVE BEEN TRAVERSED FOR CENTURIES BUT WHICH ARE STILL PRIMITIVE AS REGARDS THE INNS AND THE MODES OF CONVEYANCE SUCH TRAVELLING IS DIFFICULT IN THE SENSE THAT TRAVELLING IN PARTS OF SPAIN OR SOUTHERN ITALY
BUT ABILITY TO GIVE IT CLEAR EXPRESSION IS ONLY LESS ESSENTIAL ABILITY TO WRITE WELL IF THE WRITER HAS NOTHING TO WRITE ABOUT ENTITLES HIM TO MERE DERISION BUT THE GREATEST THOUGHT IS ROBBED OF AN IMMENSE PROPORTION OF ITS VALUE
AND NO BOOK SINCE WRITTEN HAS IN ANY WAY SUPPLANTED IT TRAVEL OF THE THIRD CATEGORY INCLUDES THE WORK OF THE TRUE WILDERNESS EXPLORERS WHO ADD TO OUR SUM OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE AND OF THE SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO FOLLOWING THEIR SEVERAL BENTS
MUCH REMAINS TO BE KNOWN SO FAR AS THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS CONCERNED OF THE SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CONDITION IN THE LONG SETTLED INTERIOR REGIONS
THAN SUCH A TRIP WHICH TO A LEARNED AND BROAD MINDED OBSERVER OFFERS THE SAME CHANCE FOR ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE AND IF HE IS HIMSELF GIFTED WITH WISDOM THE SAME CHANCE OF IMPARTING HIS KNOWLEDGE TO OTHERS
THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE SO FAR AS IT GOES TENDS TO SHOW THAT THE SOUTH AMERICAN FAUNA ALWAYS HAS BEEN MORE ARCHAIC IN TYPE THAN THE ARCTOGEAL FAUNA OF THE SAME CHRONOLOGICAL LEVEL
TO LOOSE GENERALIZATIONS AND TO ELABORATE MISINTERPRETATIONS OF PALEONTOLOGICAL RECORDS THE KIND OF WORK DONE BY MISTER HASEMAN FURNISHES AN INVALUABLE ANTISCORBUTIC
THE EXTREME OBSCURITY OF HIS STYLE AN OBSCURITY MIXED WITH OCCASIONAL BITS OF SCIENTIFIC PEDANTRY WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO TELL WHETHER OR NOT ON SOME POINTS HIS THOUGHT IS OBSCURE ALSO
MISTER HASEMAN DRAGS IT IN CONTINUALLY WHEN ITS USE IS EITHER POINTLESS AND REDUNDANT OR ELSE SERVES PURELY TO DARKEN WISDOM HE SPEAKS OF THE ANTILLEAN COMPLEX WHEN HE MEANS THE ANTILLES OF THE ORGANIC COMPLEX
AS BEING EITHER THE REMAINS OF TERTIARY AMERICAN MONKEYS OR OF AMERICAN INDIANS FROM STRATA THAT WERE LONG POST TERTIARY THE EXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY DUE TO THAT EMINENT SCIENTIST AND PUBLIC SERVANT DOCTOR MORENO
AND THAT THESE TYPES PERSISTED INTO WHAT WAS GEOLOGICALLY A VERY RECENT PERIOD ONLY SOME TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO WHEN SAVAGE MAN OF PRACTICALLY A MODERN TYPE HAD ALREADY APPEARED IN SOUTH AMERICA
SINCE THE CARBONIFEROUS EPOCH HE HOLDS THAT LIFE HAS BEEN INTERMITTENTLY DISTRIBUTED SOUTHWARD ALONG THESE CONTINENTAL MASSES WHEN THERE WERE NO BREAKS IN THEIR SOUTHWARD CONNECTION AND INTERMITTENTLY EXCHANGED BETWEEN THEM WHEN THEY WERE CONNECTED IN THE NORTH
OF A WHOLLY DIFFERENT GENUS FROM THE MODERN HORSE CONCLUSIVELY SHOWS THAT IN ITS LATER STAGES THE SOUTH AMERICAN FAUNA CONSISTED LARGELY OF TYPES THAT ELSEWHERE HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED
ALSO WORK IN THE UNTRODDEN WILDS COLONEL RONDON AND HIS ASSOCIATES HAVE DONE MUCH IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLORATION OF UNKNOWN COUNTRY AND CHERRIE AND MILLER HAVE PENETRATED AND LIVED FOR MONTHS AND YEARS IN THE WASTES ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES
AND IF POSSIBLE VIVID STYLE IS VITAL TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE BEST WORK IN EITHER SCIENCE OR HISTORY DARWIN AND HUXLEY ARE CLASSICS AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IF THEY HAD NOT WRITTEN GOOD ENGLISH THE THOUGHT IS ESSENTIAL
ROUGHLY THE TRAVELLERS WHO NOW VISIT LIKE THOSE WHO FOR THE PAST CENTURY HAVE VISITED SOUTH AMERICA COME IN THREE CATEGORIES ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THESE CATEGORIES ARE NOT DIVIDED BY HARD AND FAST LINES
SOME OF THEM AT LEAST AS ADVANCED AS FAIRLY WELL ADVANCED MODERN SAVAGES THAT THERE EXISTED VARIOUS LAND BRIDGES BETWEEN SOUTH AMERICA AND OTHER SOUTHERN CONTINENTS INCLUDING AFRICA
LONG NARROW TONGUES OF LAND THRUST IN EVERY DIRECTION ACROSS THE BROAD OCEANS ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW THE CONTINENTAL LAND MASSES HAVE BEEN IN A FAIRLY FLUID CONDITION OF INSTABILITY
CANNOT TAKE WITH THEM THE ELABORATE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO DO THE THOROUGH SCIENTIFIC WORK DEMANDED BY MODERN SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS THIS IS TRUE EVEN OF EXPLORATION DONE ALONG THE COURSES OF UNKNOWN RIVERS
AND HUMBOLDT WAS THE FIRST SCIENTIFIC MAN OF INTELLECTUAL INDEPENDENCE WHO HAD PERMISSION TO VISIT THEM TO THIS DAY MANY OF HIS SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS ARE OF REAL VALUE
SO IMPERFECTLY EXPRESSED AS TO MAKE US DOUBTFUL WHETHER IT IS PERFECTLY APPREHENDED BY THE WRITER HE CAN AVOID THE USE OF THOSE PEDANTIC TERMS WHICH ARE REALLY NOTHING BUT OFFENSIVE AND FORTUNATELY EPHEMERAL SCIENTIFIC SLANG
COME IN THIS CATEGORY THEY CAN ADD LITTLE TO OUR GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE BUT IF THEY ARE COMPETENT ZOOLOGISTS OR ARCHAEOLOGISTS ESPECIALLY IF THEY LIVE OR SOJOURN LONG IN A LOCALITY
THE UPHOLDERS OF THIS THEORY BASE IT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF LIVING AND FOSSIL FORMS OF LIFE THAT IS IT IS BASED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON BIOLOGICAL AND NOT GEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
THERE IS NO BETTER EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF ZOOLOGIST WHO DOES FIRST CLASS FIELD WORK IN THE WILDERNESS THAN JOHN D HASEMAN WHO SPENT FROM NINETEEN O SEVEN TO NINETEEN TEN IN PAINSTAKING AND THOROUGH SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION
AS INCIDENTS TO THEIR MAMMALOGICAL AND ORNITHOLOGICAL WORK PROFESSOR FARRABEE THE ANTHROPOLOGIST IS A CAPITAL EXAMPLE OF THE MAN WHO DOES THIS HARD AND VALUABLE TYPE OF WORK
THE REASON THAT IT IS WORTH WHILE TO ENTER THIS PROTEST AGAINST MISTER HASEMAN'S STYLE IS BECAUSE HIS WORK IS OF SUCH REAL AND MARKED VALUE THE PAMPHLET ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF SOUTH AMERICAN SPECIES SHOWS THAT TO EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY AS A FIELD WORKER
YET IF THE EXISTENCE OF WIDELY SEPARATED BUT CLOSELY ALLIED FORMS IS HABITUALLY TO BE EXPLAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VIEWS OF THE EXTREMISTS OF THIS SCHOOL WE COULD FROM THE EXCLUSIVE STUDY OF CERTAIN GROUPS OF ANIMALS
AND NEITHER AFRICA NOR ASIA OFFERS A MORE INVITING FIELD FOR THE BEST KIND OF FIELD WORKER IN GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLORATION AND IN ZOOLOGICAL GEOLOGICAL AND PALEONTOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
THE OPPOSITE VIEW IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN FREQUENT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE GREAT LAND MASSES ALIKE IN THE TROPICS IN THE SOUTH TEMPERATE ZONE AND IN THE ANTARCTIC REGION
FOR BOOKS OF TRAVEL DARWIN'S VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE IS TO ME THE BEST BOOK OF THE KIND EVER WRITTEN IT IS ONE OF THOSE CLASSICS WHICH DECLINE TO GO INTO ARTIFICIAL CATEGORIES AND WHICH STAND BY THEMSELVES
YET DO NOT PERMIT THE FACULTY OF WISE GENERALIZATION TO BE ATROPHIED BY EXCESSIVE DEVOTION TO LABYRINTHINE DETAIL HASEMAN UPHOLDS WITH STRONG REASONING THE THEORY THAT SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF ALL BUT THE LOWEST FORMS OF LIFE ON THIS GLOBE
OF THE REMAINS OF MAN ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMAINS OF THE GREAT EXTINCT SOUTH AMERICAN FAUNA OF THE MYLODON OF A GIANT UNGULATE OF A HUGE CAT LIKE THE LION AND OF AN EXTRAORDINARY ABERRANT HORSE
INSTEAD OF THE CHARACTERISTIC OR BODILY CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ANIMAL OR SPECIES AND OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLEX WHEN HE MEANS NOTHING WHATEVER BUT THE ENVIRONMENT
IF EXPRESSED IN A MEAN OR OBSCURE MANNER MISTER HASEMAN HAS SUCH EXCELLENT THOUGHT THAT IT IS A PITY TO MAKE IT A WORK OF IRRITATING LABOR TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT THE THOUGHT IS
IT IS DESIRABLE THAT HERE AND THERE A PART OF THE WORK SHOULD BE DONE IN OUTLINE BY SUCH A GEOGRAPHIC AND ZOOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE AS OURS WE WOULD FOR EXAMPLE BE VERY GRATEFUL FOR SUCH WORK IN PORTIONS OF THE INTERIOR OF THE GUIANAS
BUT THESE PLACES WERE IN SPANISH COLONIES AND ACCESS TO THEM HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN BY THE MISCHIEVOUS AND INTOLERANT TYRANNY ECCLESIASTICAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC WHICH THEN RENDERED SPAIN THE MOST BACKWARD OF EUROPEAN NATIONS
AND YET DARWIN WITH HIS USUAL MODESTY SPOKE OF IT AS IN EFFECT A YACHTING VOYAGE HUMBOLDT'S WORK HAD A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE THOUGHT OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD HIS TRIP WAS ONE OF ADVENTURE AND DANGER
TRAVELS OF THIS KIND IN SOUTH AMERICA IN ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL MATTERS THE STUDIES AND OBSERVATIONS OF THESE TRAVELLERS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO SUPPLEMENT AND SOMETIMES TO CORRECT THOSE OF TRAVELLERS OF THE FIRST CATEGORY
ARE OTHER INSTANCES OF THE WORK THAT CAN THUS BE DONE BURTON'S WRITINGS ON THE INTERIOR OF BRAZIL OFFER AN EXCELLENT INSTANCE OF THE VALUE OF A SOJOURN OR TRIP OF THIS TYPE EVEN WITHOUT ANY ESPECIAL SCIENTIFIC OBJECT
MUST BEWARE OF REGARDING HIMSELF AS BEING THEREBY RENDERED FIT FOR GENUINE WILDERNESS WORK OR COMPETENT TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THE MEN WHO DO SUCH WORK TO CROSS THE ANDES ON MULE BACK ALONG THE REGULAR ROUTES IS A FEAT
AND ALL THE OTHER CONTINENTS PRESENT AND PAST OF THE WORLD SINCE A PERIOD GEOLOGICALLY NOT VERY REMOTE THESE LAND BRIDGES MOREOVER MUST MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN LITERALLY BRIDGES
AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF THIS TRUE WILDERNESS WORK GEOGRAPHICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL REMAINS TO BE DONE IN SOUTH AMERICA IT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH REASONABLE THOROUGHNESS ONLY BY THE EFFORTS OF VERY MANY DIFFERENT WORKERS EACH IN HIS OWN SPECIAL FIELD
THE TROUBLE IS THAT AS MORE GROUPS OF ANIMALS ARE STUDIED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THIS HYPOTHESIS THE NUMBER OF SUCH LAND BRIDGES DEMANDED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EXISTING FACTS OF ANIMAL DISTRIBUTION IS CONSTANTLY AND INDEFINITELY EXTENDED
THEIR WORK MAY BE INVALUABLE FROM THE SCIENTIFIC STANDPOINT THE WORK OF THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS AMONG THE IMMEASURABLY ANCIENT RUINS OF THE LOW LAND FORESTS AND THE ANDEAN PLATEAUX IS OF THIS KIND
MUST BE FURTHEST REMOVED FROM FINALITY THE ZOOLOGIST WHO WORKS TO MOST ADVANTAGE IN THE WILDERNESS MUST TAKE HIS TIME AND THEREFORE HE MUST NORMALLY FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF AND NOT ACCOMPANY THE FIRST EXPLORERS
THAT IS OFFERED BY A TRIP OF SIMILAR LENGTH THROUGH THE LARGER CITIES OF EUROPE OR THE UNITED STATES PROBABLY THE BEST INSTANCE OF THE EXCELLENT USE TO WHICH SUCH AN OBSERVER CAN PUT HIS EXPERIENCE IS AFFORDED BY THE VOLUME OF MISTER BRYCE
AND HE ALSO UPHOLDS THE VIEW THAT FROM A COMMON ANCESTRAL FORM THE SAME SPECIES HAS BEEN OFTEN DEVELOPED IN ENTIRELY DISCONNECTED LOCALITIES WHEN IN THESE LOCALITIES THE CONDITIONS OF ENVIRONMENT WERE THE SAME
APPENDIX A THE WORK OF THE FIELD ZOOLOGIST AND FIELD GEOGRAPHER IN SOUTH AMERICA PORTIONS OF SOUTH AMERICA ARE NOW ENTERING ON A CAREER OF GREAT SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
FOR IT IS NOT SAFE TO GENERALIZE OVERMUCH ABOUT ANY COUNTRY MERELY FROM A VISIT TO ITS CAPITAL OR ITS CHIEF SEAPORT THESE TRAVELLERS OF THE SECOND CATEGORY CAN GIVE US MOST INTERESTING AND VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT QUAINT LITTLE BELATED CITIES
OR THE BARREN GROUNDS WEST OF HUDSON BAY A HUNDRED YEARS AGO EVEN SEVENTY OR EIGHTY YEARS AGO BEFORE THE AGE OF STEAMBOATS AND RAILROADS IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT THAN AT PRESENT TO DEFINE THE LIMITS BETWEEN THIS CLASS AND THE NEXT
UNQUESTIONABLY THE DISTRIBUTION OF MANY FORMS OF LIFE PAST AND PRESENT OFFERS PROBLEMS WHICH WITH OUR PRESENT PALEONTOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE WE ARE WHOLLY UNABLE TO SOLVE
AND BOTH MISCHIEVOUS UNLESS THIS SCIENTIST POSSESS A RARE AND ACCURATE HABIT OF THOUGHT JOINED TO INDUSTRY AND MASTERY OF DETAIL NAMELY THE GIFT OF CLEAR AND INTERESTING WRITING AND THE GIFT OF GENERALIZATION
HIS FAVORITE THESIS INCLUDED THE ORIGIN OF MAMMALIAN LIFE AND OF MAN HIMSELF IN SOUTHERNMOST SOUTH AMERICA WITH AS INCIDENTS THE BELIEF THAT THE MAMMALIAN BEARING STRATA OF SOUTH AMERICA
INSTEAD OF LEAVING VACANCIES WHICH MUST BE FILLED BY THE PUZZLED AND GROPING READER HIS OWN VIEWS AND HIS QUOTATIONS FROM THE VIEWS OF OTHERS ABOUT THE STATIC AND DYNAMIC THEORIES OF DISTRIBUTION ARE EXAMPLES OF AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE
HIS WRITINGS ARE RENDERED VALUABLE BY HIS ACCURACY AND COMMON SENSE THE NEED OF THE FORMER OF THESE TWO ATTRIBUTES WILL BE APPRECIATED BY WHOEVER HAS STUDIED THE REALLY SCANDALOUS FICTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED AS GENUINE BY SOME MODERN EXPLORERS
BY PARITY OF REASONING THE LAND BRIDGES COULD BE MADE A HUNDRED INSTEAD OF MERELY TEN IN NUMBER THE FACTS OF DISTRIBUTION ARE IN MANY CASES INEXPLICABLE WITH OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE
COMPARABLE TO THE FEATS OF THE ENERGETIC TOURISTS WHO BY THOUSANDS TRAVERSE THE MULE TRAILS IN OUT OF THE WAY NOOKS OF SWITZERLAND AN ORDINARY TRIP ON THE HIGHWAY PORTIONS OF THE AMAZON PARAGUAY OR ORINOCO IN ITSELF
THE EXPLORER IS MERELY THE MOST ADVENTUROUS KIND OF FIELD GEOGRAPHER AND THERE ARE TWO OR THREE POINTS WORTH KEEPING IN MIND IN DEALING WITH THE SOUTH AMERICAN WORK OF THE FIELD GEOGRAPHER AND FIELD ZOOLOGIST
IF WE CONSIDER ONLY THE BIOLOGICAL FACTS CONCERNING SOME ONE GROUP OF ANIMALS IT IS NOT ONLY EASY BUT INEVITABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT ITS DISTRIBUTION MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EXISTENCE OF SOME FORMER DIRECT LAND BRIDGE EXTENDING
OF COURSE TRAVELLERS OF THIS KIND NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THEMSELVES DO NOT QUALIFY THEM TO SPEAK AS WILDERNESS EXPLORERS
AND ADVENTURERS IN SOUTH AMERICA AND THE NEED OF THE LATTER BY WHOEVER HAS STUDIED SOME OF THE WILD THEORIES PROPOUNDED IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE CONCERNING THE HISTORY OF LIFE ON THE SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENT THERE IS HOWEVER ONE SERIOUS CRITICISM TO BE MADE ON HASEMAN
ARRIVE AT DIRECTLY OPPOSITE AND INCOMPATIBLE CONCLUSIONS THE MOST BRILLIANT AND UNSAFE EXPONENT OF THIS SCHOOL WAS AMEGHINO WHO POSSESSED AND ABUSED TWO GIFTS BOTH ESSENTIAL TO THE HIGHEST TYPE OF SCIENTIST
COME WITH US AND SEE FOR YOURSELF IT IS A FOOL'S ERRAND NO THE CHRIST IS BORN THE CHRIST HOW DO YOU KNOW LET US GO AND SEE FIRST THE MAN LAUGHED SCORNFULLY THE CHRIST INDEED
AT THE BARE SUSPICION OF BEING CAPABLE OF SUCH A DEED NO LORD MONTGOMERY IT IS NOT OUR CONQUEROR WE ARE OPPOSING IT IS A TRAITOR WHO UNDER THE MASK OF FRIENDSHIP HAS ATTEMPTED TO USURP OUR RIGHTS DESTROY OUR LIBERTIES AND MAKE A DESERT OF OUR ONCE HAPPY COUNTRY
WHICH WOULD MAKE ME REVERE ITS POSSESSOR WERE HE THE LOWLIEST MAN IN YOUR LEGIONS ALLOW ME NOBLEST OF SCOTS TO PLEAD ONE WORD IN VINDICATION OF HIM TO WHOM MY ALLEGIANCE IS PLEDGED HAD HE COME HITHER CONDUCTED BY WAR ALONE WHAT WOULD EDWARD HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN ANY OTHER CONQUEROR
I KNOW MY KING TOO WELL TO EXPECT PACIFIC MEASURES HE MAY DIE WITH THE SWORD IN HIS HAND BUT HE WILL NEVER GRANT AN HOUR'S REPOSE TO THIS COUNTRY TILL IT SUBMITS TO HIS SCEPTER THEN REPLIED WALLACE THE SWORD MUST BE THE PORTION OF HIM AND HIS
WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN THEY LED THE WAY TO THE MARAH AND BY NIGHTFALL HAD EVERYTHING SAFE IN THE FIELD THEN THEY KINDLED A FIRE DOWN BY THE GATE PARTOOK OF THEIR HUMBLE SUPPER AND SAT DOWN TO REST AND TALK LEAVING ONE ON WATCH
THAT OUGHT TO BE THE HAPPY RESULT OF MATRIMONY AND CHASTITY CONSEQUENTLY HE FREQUENTLY REPRIMANDED JOHN BY TELLING HIM THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS BENEATH THE DIGNITY AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD INDIANS
CERTAINLY NOT RETURNED HE BUT I SHALL SEE YOU AMIDST YOUR NOBLE FRIENDS AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD WHEN THE PEACE YOUR ARMS MUST WIN IS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS I SHALL THEN REVISIT SCOTLAND AND OPENLY DECLARE MY FRIENDSHIP FOR SIR WILLIAM WALLACE
ONE OF THE WOMEN TOOK THE BABY AND WENT TO MARY LYING NEAR AND PUT IT IN HER ARMS THEN THE BYSTANDERS COLLECTED ABOUT THE TWO IT IS THE CHRIST SAID A SHEPHERD AT LAST
BY THE GATE HUGGING HIS MANTLE CLOSE THE WATCHMAN WALKED AT TIMES HE STOPPED ATTRACTED BY A STIR AMONG THE SLEEPING HERDS OR BY A JACKAL'S CRY OFF ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THE MIDNIGHT WAS SLOW COMING TO HIM BUT AT LAST IT CAME
ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE WALL AND AS AN ADDITIONAL SECURITY AGAINST THE CONSTANT DANGER A HEDGE OF THE RHAMNUS HAD BEEN PLANTED
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THEIR DIFFICULTIES AND CONSEQUENT UNHAPPINESS CONTINUED AND RATHER INCREASED CONTINUALLY EXCITING IN MY BREAST THE MOST FEARFUL APPREHENSIONS AND GREATEST ANXIETY FOR THEIR SAFETY
PARENTS MOTHERS ESPECIALLY WILL LOVE THEIR CHILDREN THOUGH EVER SO UNKIND AND DISOBEDIENT THEIR EYES OF COMPASSION OF REAL SENTIMENTAL AFFECTION WILL BE INVOLUNTARILY EXTENDED AFTER THEM IN THEIR GREATEST EXCESSES OF INIQUITY
THE LORD WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM LET US MAKE HASTE THEN THEY ALL AROSE AND LEFT THE MARAH AROUND THE MOUNTAIN AND THROUGH THE TOWN THEY PASSED AND CAME TO THE GATE OF THE KHAN WHERE THERE WAS A MAN ON WATCH WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HE ASKED
GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND ON EARTH PEACE GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN NOT ONCE THE PRAISE BUT MANY TIMES
I SHALL ACCOMPANY YOU MYSELF TO THE SCOTTISH BORDERS AND THERE MADE MY REPLY DE WARENNE WHO DID INDEED LOOK FOR THIS ANSWER REPLIED I ANTICIPATED THAT SUCH WOULD BE YOUR DETERMINATION AND I HAVE TO REGRET THAT THE WILD COUNSELS WHICH SURROUND MY PRINCE PRECIPITATE HIM INTO CONDUCT
HIS TASK WAS DONE NOW FOR THE DREAMLESS SLEEP WITH WHICH LABOR BLESSES ITS WEARIED CHILDREN HE MOVED TOWARDS THE FIRE BUT PAUSED A LIGHT WAS BREAKING AROUND HIM SOFT AND WHITE LIKE THE MOON'S HE WAITED BREATHLESSLY
NOT UNFREQUENTLY THE SHEPHERD WAS STARTLED BY THE BLARE OF TRUMPETS AND PEERING OUT BEHELD A COHORT SOMETIMES A LEGION IN MARCH AND WHEN THE GLITTERING CRESTS WERE GONE AND THE EXCITEMENT INCIDENT TO THE INTRUSION OVER HE BENT HIMSELF TO EVOLVE THE MEANING OF THE EAGLES AND GILDED GLOBES OF THE SOLDIERY AND THE CHARM OF A LIFE SO THE OPPOSITE OF HIS OWN YET THESE MEN RUDE AND SIMPLE AS THEY WERE HAD A KNOWLEDGE AND A WISDOM OF THEIR OWN
AND LYING IN A MANGER THE FIRST SPEAKER GAZED INTO THE FIRE THOUGHTFULLY BUT AT LENGTH SAID LIKE ONE POSSESSED OF A SUDDEN RESOLVE THERE IS BUT ONE PLACE IN BETHLEHEM WHERE THERE ARE MANGERS BUT ONE AND THAT IS IN THE CAVE NEAR THE OLD KHAN
ON THE GROUND NEAR EACH ONE LAY HIS CROOK A SYMBOL OF HIS CALLING AND A WEAPON OF OFFENCE SUCH WERE THE SHEPHERDS OF JUDEA IN APPEARANCE ROUGH AND SAVAGE AS THE GAUNT DOGS SITTING WITH THEM AROUND THE BLAZE IN FACT SIMPLE MINDED TENDER HEARTED
AFTER THOMAS AND JOHN ARRIVED TO MANHOOD IN ADDITION TO THE FORMER CHARGE JOHN GOT TWO WIVES
THE CHILD IS HERE THEY WERE LED TO ONE OF THE MANGERS AND THERE THE CHILD WAS THE LANTERN WAS BROUGHT AND THE SHEPHERDS STOOD BY MUTE THE LITTLE ONE MADE NO SIGN IT WAS AS OTHERS JUST BORN WHERE IS THE MOTHER ASKED THE WATCHMAN
WHERE IT WAS SAID THAT HE WAS AN INDUSTRIOUS SCHOLAR AND MADE GREAT PROFICIENCY IN THE STUDY OF THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES TO WHICH HE ATTENDED HAVING SPENT TWO YEARS AT THAT INSTITUTION HE RETURNED IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN
AND COUNSEL MY KING AS BECOMES AN HONEST MAN HIGHLY WOULD HE ESTIMATE SUCH COUNSEL CRIED WALLACE HAD HE VIRTUE TO FEEL THAT HE WHO WILL BE JUST TO HIS SOVEREIGN'S ENEMIES MUST BE OF AN HONOR THAT WILL BIND HIM WITH DOUBLE FIDELITY TO HIS KING
I KNOW THAT SUCH EXERCISES ARE FREQUENTLY UNAVAILING BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR ULTIMATE FAILURE IT STILL REMAINS TRUE AND EVER WILL THAT THE LOVE OF A PARENT FOR A DISOBEDIENT CHILD
THEN THE HERALD RAISED HIS EYES AS SEEKING APPROVAL OF ONE FAR OFF HIS WINGS STIRRED AND SPREAD SLOWLY AND MAJESTICALLY ON THEIR UPPER SIDE WHITE AS SNOW
WHICH MUST DRAW MUCH BLOOD ON BOTH SIDES BEFORE HIS ROYAL FATHER'S PRESENCE CAN REGAIN WHAT HE HAS LOST AH MY LORD REPLIED WALLACE IS IT TO BE NOTHING BUT WAR HAVE YOU NOW A STRONGHOLD OF ANY FORCE IN ALL THE HIGHLANDS IS NOT THE GREATER PART OF THE LOWLANDS FREE
AND IN THE LAST CAPACITY WENT TWO OR THREE TIMES TO PHILADELPHIA TO ASSIST IN MAKING TREATIES WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES THOMAS HAD FOUR WIVES BY WHOM HE HAD EIGHT CHILDREN JACOB JEMISON HIS SECOND SON BY HIS LAST WIFE
IT SO HAPPENED THAT AS HE WAS LOOKING OUT FOR HIS ENEMIES HE DISCOVERED TWO MEN BOILING SAP IN THE WOODS HE WATCHED THEM UNPERCEIVED TILL DARK WHEN HE ADVANCED WITH A NOISELESS STEP TO WHERE THEY WERE STANDING
GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND ON EARTH PEACE GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN WHEN THE SHEPHERDS CAME FULLY TO THEIR SENSES THEY STARED AT EACH OTHER STUPIDLY UNTIL ONE OF THEM SAID IT WAS GABRIEL THE LORD'S MESSENGER UNTO MEN NONE ANSWERED
AND THEY LISTENED FEAR NOT FOR BEHOLD I BRING YOU GOOD TIDINGS OF GREAT JOY WHICH SHALL BE TO ALL PEOPLE THE VOICE IN SWEETNESS AND SOOTHING MORE THAN HUMAN AND LOW AND CLEAR PENETRATED ALL THEIR BEING AND FILLED THEM WITH ASSURANCE
RUTHLESS TYRANT IF THE BLOOD OF ABEL CALLED FOR VENGEANCE ON HIS MURDERER WHAT MUST BE THE VIALS OF WRATH WHICH ARE RESERVED FOR THEE A FLUSH OVERSPREAD THE FACE OF DE WARENNE AT THIS APOSTROPHE AND FORCING A SMILE
BUT THOMAS EARL OF LANCASTER THE KING'S NEPHEW IS COME FROM ABROAD WITH A NUMEROUS ARMY HE IS TO CONDUCT THE SCOTTISH PRISONERS TO THE BORDERS AND THEN TO FALL UPON SCOTLAND WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH
IN A VERSE OF THE SHEMA THEY FOUND ALL THE LEARNING AND ALL THE LAW OF THEIR SIMPLE LIVES THAT THEIR LORD WAS ONE GOD AND THAT THEY MUST LOVE HIM WITH ALL THEIR SOULS AND THEY LOVED HIM AND SUCH WAS THEIR WISDOM SURPASSING THAT OF KINGS
WITH THEIR FAMILIES IS WHEN THEIR CHILDREN ARE YOUNG
HE WAS MANLY IN HIS DEPORTMENT COURAGEOUS AND ACTIVE AND COMMANDED RESPECT THOUGH HE APPEARED WELL PLEASED WITH PEACE
YE SHALL FIND THE BABE WRAPPED IN SWADDLING CLOTHES LYING IN A MANGER THE HERALD SPOKE NOT AGAIN HIS GOOD TIDINGS WERE TOLD YET HE STAYED AWHILE SUDDENLY THE LIGHT OF WHICH HE SEEMED THE CENTRE
HOW ARE YOU TO KNOW HIM HE WAS BORN THIS NIGHT AND IS NOW LYING IN A MANGER SO WE WERE TOLD AND THERE IS BUT ONE PLACE IN BETHLEHEM WITH MANGERS THE CAVE YES COME WITH US
THOMAS WAS ANXIOUS TO GO WITH ME BUT AS I HAVE BEFORE OBSERVED THE CHIEFS WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON THE ACCOUNT OF HIS COURAGE AND SKILL IN WAR EXPECTING THAT THEY SHOULD NEED HIS ASSISTANCE HE WAS A GREAT COUNSELLOR AND A CHIEF WHEN QUITE YOUNG
TO OUR FRIENDS AT THAT PLACE AND REQUEST THE CHIEFS TO HOLD A COUNCIL AND DISPOSE OF JOHN AS THEY SHOULD THINK PROPER SHANKS SET OUT ON HIS ERRAND IMMEDIATELY AND JOHN FEARING THAT HE SHOULD BE APPREHENDED AND PUNISHED FOR THE CRIME HE HAD COMMITTED
AT BIRTH IT BECAME HIS CHARGE HIS TO KEEP ALL ITS DAYS TO HELP OVER THE FLOODS TO CARRY DOWN THE HOLLOWS TO NAME AND TRAIN IT WAS TO BE HIS COMPANION HIS OBJECT OF THOUGHT AND INTEREST THE SUBJECT OF HIS WILL
TURNED ROSEATE AND BEGAN TO TREMBLE THEN UP FAR AS THE MEN COULD SEE THERE WAS FLASHING OF WHITE WINGS AND COMING AND GOING OF RADIANT FORMS AND VOICES AS OF A MULTITUDE CHANTING IN UNISON
HAD ANY PROBABLE CHANCE FOR THE THRONE BUT BRUCE OR BALIOL SUCH READY ACQUIESCENCE WAS MEANT TO CREATE THEM ONE BRUCE CONSCIOUS OF HIS INHERENT RIGHTS REJECTED THE INIQUITOUS DEMAND OF EDWARD BALIOL ACCORDED WITH IT AND WAS MADE KING
FOR MY SON THOMAS FROM SOME CAUSE UNKNOWN TO ME FROM THE TIME HE WAS A SMALL LAD ALWAYS CALLED HIS BROTHER JOHN A WITCH WHICH WAS THE CAUSE AS THEY GREW TOWARDS MANHOOD OF FREQUENT AND SEVERE QUARRELS BETWEEN THEM
CHRIST THE LORD IS BORN SAID HE NOT SO THEN ANOTHER RECOVERED HIS VOICE AND REPLIED THAT IS WHAT HE SAID AND DID HE NOT ALSO SAY IN THE CITY OF DAVID WHICH IS OUR BETHLEHEM YONDER AND THAT WE SHOULD FIND HIM A BABE IN SWADDLING CLOTHES
A MILE AND A HALF IT MAY BE TWO MILES SOUTHEAST OF BETHLEHEM THERE IS A PLAIN SEPARATED FROM THE TOWN BY AN INTERVENING SWELL OF THE MOUNTAIN BESIDES BEING WELL SHELTERED FROM THE NORTH WINDS
AND WITH JOYFUL FACES DEPARTED IN THE KHAN TO ALL THE PEOPLE AROUSED AND PRESSING ABOUT THEM THEY TOLD THEIR STORY AND THROUGH THE TOWN AND ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE MARAH THEY CHANTED THE REFRAIN OF THE ANGELS
THOUGH HIS AMIABLE NATURE MADE HIM GRACIOUS IN THE MIDST OF HOSTILITY AND HIS GOOD DISPOSITIONS WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO ACT DISGRACEFULL IN ANY CONCERN YET DUTY TO GOD SEEMED A POET'S FLIGHT TO HIM
HIS NATURAL ABILITIES WERE SAID TO BE OF A SUPERIOR CAST AND HE SOARED ABOVE THE TRIFLING SUBJECTS OF REVENGE
REQUESTING HIS PRESENCE AT AN ENTERTAINMENT WHICH BY HER HUSBAND'S CONSENT SHE MEANT TO GIVE THAT NIGHT AT SNAWDOUN TO THE SOUTHRON LORDS BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE FOR ENGLAND I FEAR YOU DARE NOT EXPEND YOUR STRENGTH ON THIS PARTY INQUIRED WALLACE TURNING TO MONTGOMERY
AS THESE ARE YOUR SENTIMENTS REPLIED WALLACE I SHALL HOPE THAT YOU WILL UNITE YOUR INFLUENCE WITH THAT OF THE BRAVE EARL OF GLOUCESTER TO PERSUADE YOUR KING TO STOP THIS BLOODSHED FOR IT IS NO VAIN BOAST TO DECLARE THAT HE MAY BURY SCOTLAND BENEATH HER SLAUGHTERED SONS
WHILE THEY TALKED AND BEFORE THE FIRST WATCH WAS OVER ONE BY ONE THE SHEPHERDS WENT TO SLEEP EACH LYING WHERE HE HAD SAT THE NIGHT LIKE MOST NIGHTS OF THE WINTER SEASON IN THE HILL COUNTRY WAS CLEAR CRISP AND SPARKLING WITH STARS
AND IS NOW AT BUFFALO WHERE I HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE CONTEMPLATES COMMENCING THE STUDY OF MEDICINE AS A PROFESSION
AT THE SIDE FARTHEST FROM THE TOWN CLOSE UNDER A BLUFF THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE MARAH OR SHEEPCOT AGES OLD IN SOME LONG FORGOTTEN FORAY THE BUILDING HAD BEEN UNROOFED AND ALMOST DEMOLISHED THE ENCLOSURE ATTACHED TO IT REMAINED INTACT HOWEVER
WHEN REMONSTRANCES WERE SENT TO LONDON HE NEITHER PUNISHED NOR REPRIMANDED THE DELINQUENTS BUT MARCHED AN ARMED FORCE INTO OUR COUNTRY TO COMPEL US TO BE TRAMPLED ON IT WAS NOT AN ALEXANDER NOR A CHARLEMAGNE COMING IN HIS STRENGTH TO SUBDUE ANCIENT ENEMIES OR TO AGGRANDIZE HIS NAME
SEEKING FRESH WALKS FOR THEIR FLOCKS LED THEM UP TO THIS PLAIN AND FROM EARLY MORNING THE GROVES HAD BEEN MADE RING WITH CALLS AND THE BLOWS OF AXES THE BLEATING OF SHEEP AND GOATS THE TINKLING OF BELLS THE LOWING OF CATTLE AND THE BARKING OF DOGS
JOHN ALWAYS RESENTED SUCH REPRIMAND AND REPROOF WITH A GREAT DEGREE OF PASSION THOUGH THEY NEVER QUARRELLED UNLESS THOMAS WAS INTOXICATED IN HIS FITS OF DRUNKENNESS THOMAS SEEMED TO LOSE ALL HIS NATURAL REASON
THERE WAS NO WIND THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED NEVER SO PURE AND THE STILLNESS WAS MORE THAN SILENCE IT WAS A HOLY HUSH A WARNING THAT HEAVEN WAS STOOPING LOW TO WHISPER SOME GOOD THING TO THE LISTENING EARTH
SUCH PROOF GIVE YOUR SOVEREIGN AND IF HE HAVE ONE SPARK OF THAT GREATNESS OF MIND WHICH YOU SAY HE POSSESSES THOUGH HE MAY NOT ADOPT YOUR ADVICE HE MUST RESPECT THE ADVISER
AT LENGTH THOMAS CAME TO MY HOUSE ON THE FIRST DAY OF JULY EIGHTEEN ELEVEN IN MY ABSENCE SOMEWHAT INTOXICATED WHERE HE FOUND JOHN WITH WHOM HE IMMEDIATELY COMMENCED A QUARREL ON THEIR OLD SUBJECTS OF DIFFERENCE
HE LOOKED UP THE STARS WERE GONE THE LIGHT WAS DROPPING AS FROM A WINDOW IN THE SKY AS HE LOOKED IT BECAME A SPLENDOR THEN IN TERROR HE CRIED AWAKE AWAKE UP SPRANG THE DOGS AND HOWLING RAN AWAY
AS WAS HER HABIT IN THOSE DAYS ROME DID NOT WAIT FOR PEOPLE SLOW TO INQUIRE ABOUT HER SHE CAME TO THEM OVER THE HILLS ALONG WHICH HE WAS LEADING HIS LAGGING HERD OR IN THE FASTNESSES IN WHICH HE WAS HIDING THEM
THE CHIEFS SOON ASSEMBLED IN COUNCIL ON THE TRIAL OF JOHN AND AFTER HAVING SERIOUSLY EXAMINED THE MATTER ACCORDING TO THEIR LAWS JUSTIFIED HIS CONDUCT AND ACQUITTED HIM
WHO IS AT THIS TIME TWENTY SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE WENT TO DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING A GOOD EDUCATION
BY VANQUISHING NATIONS FAR REMOTE WITH WHOM HE COULD HAVE NO AFFINITY TERRIBLE AS SUCH AMBITION WAS IT IS INNOCENCE TO WHAT EDWARD HAS DONE HE CAME IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO SCOTLAND AS A FRIEND THE NATION COMMITTED ITS DEAREST INTERESTS TO HIS VIRTUE
BRETHREN LET US GO SEE THIS THING WHICH HAS COME TO PASS THE PRIESTS AND DOCTORS HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR THE CHRIST NOW HE IS BORN AND THE LORD HAS GIVEN US A SIGN BY WHICH TO KNOW HIM LET US GO UP AND WORSHIP HIM BUT THE FLOCKS
THE LIGHT DEEPENED THINGS BEFORE INVISIBLE CAME TO VIEW HE SAW THE WHOLE FIELD AND ALL IT SHELTERED A CHILL SHARPER THAN THAT OF THE FROSTY AIR A CHILL OF FEAR SMOTE HIM
ABOVE ITS SHOULDERS TOWERED THE TOPS OF WINGS SHINING AND FOLDED A STAR OVER ITS FOREHEAD GLOWED WITH STEADY LUSTRE BRILLIANT AS HESPERUS ITS HANDS WERE STRETCHED TOWARDS THEM IN BLESSING ITS FACE WAS SERENE AND DIVINELY BEAUTIFUL
AS WALLACE PRESSED THE HAND OF HIS NEW FRIEND TO LEAVE HIM TO REPOSE A MESSENGER ENTERED FROM LORD MAR TO REQUEST THE REGENT'S PRESENCE IN HIS CLOSET HE FOUND HIM WITH LORD DE WARENNE THE LATTER PRESENTED HIM WITH ANOTHER DISPATCH FROM THE PRINCE OF WALES
I HAVE FREQUENTLY HEARD IT ASSERTED BY WHITE PEOPLE AND CAN TRULY SAY FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE
I REVERE YOUR PRINCIPLE SIR WILLIAM WALLACE BUT IT IS TOO SUBLIME TO BE MINE NAY NOR WOULD IT BE POLITIC FOR ONE WHO HOLDS HIS POSSESSIONS IN ENGLAND BY THE RIGHT OF CONQUEST TO QUESTION THE VIRTUE OF THE DEED
AS THEY WENT BAREHEADED HABITUALLY THEIR HAIR STOOD OUT IN THICK COARSE SUNBURNT SHOCKS THEIR BEARD COVERED THEIR THROATS AND FELL IN MATS DOWN THE BREAST MANTLES OF THE SKIN OF KIDS AND LAMBS WITH THE FLEECE ON WRAPPED THEM FROM NECK TO KNEE
SCOTLAND WILL DISCHARGE ITSELF UPON THE VALLEYS OF ENGLAND AND THERE COMPEL THEM TO SHARE THE FATE IN WHICH WE MAY BE DOOMED TO PERISH I WILL THINK OF THIS DISCOURSE RETURNED MONTGOMERY WHEN I AM FAR DISTANT AND RELY ON IT NOBLE WALLACE THAT I WILL ASSERT THE PRIVILEGE OF MY BIRTH
HE WOULD PUT LORD DOUGLAS INTO CLOSER CONFINEMENT AND WHILE THE SOUTHRON FLEETS WOULD INEVITABLY BAFFLE WALLACE'S ATTEMPTS THE MOMENT THE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS WAS COMPLETED ON THE BORDERS AN ARMY FROM ENGLAND SHOULD ENTER SCOTLAND AND RAVAGE IT WITH FIRE AND SWORD
JOHN'S ANGER BECAME DESPERATE HE CAUGHT THOMAS BY THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD DRAGGED HIM OUT AT THE DOOR AND THERE KILLED HIM BY A BLOW WHICH HE GAVE HIM ON THE HEAD WITH HIS TOMAHAWK I RETURNED SOON AFTER AND FOUND MY SON LIFELESS AT THE DOOR
AND TO BE FRIENDLY TOLD THEM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR CONTINUING TO CHERISH SO MUCH MALIGNITY AND MALICE THAT IT WOULD END IN THEIR DESTRUCTION THE DISGRACE OF THEIR FAMILIES AND BRING ME DOWN TO THE GRAVE
AND SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS HAD COME IN TO ASSIST IN TAKING CARE OF THE CORPSE I HIRED SHANKS AN INDIAN TO GO TO BUFFALO
AFTER HAVING TRANSFERRED HIS CAPTIVES TO THE CHARGE OF LORD MAR WALLACE WENT ALONE TO THE CHAMBER OF MONTGOMERY TO SEE WHETHER THE STATE OF HIS WOUNDS WOULD ALLOW HIM TO MARCH ON THE MORROW WHILE HE WAS YET THERE AN INVITATION ARRIVED FROM THE COUNTESS OF MAR
WHY THEN THIS UNRECEDING DETERMINATION TO INVADE US NOT A BLADE OF GRASS WOULD I DISTURB ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHEVIOT IF WE MIGHT HAVE PEACE LET EDWARD YIELD TO THAT AND THOUGH HE HAS PIERCED US WITH MANY WOUNDS WE WILL YET FORGIVE HIM DE WARENNE SHOOK HIS HEAD
I GIVE YOU PEACE THE WATCHMAN SAID TO JOSEPH AND THE BETH DAGONITE HERE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A CHILD BORN THIS NIGHT WHOM THEY ARE TO KNOW BY FINDING HIM IN SWADDLING CLOTHES AND LYING IN A MANGER
WE HAVE SEEN AND HEARD GREAT THINGS TO NIGHT THEY REPLIED WELL WE TOO HAVE SEEN GREAT THINGS BUT HEARD NOTHING WHAT DID YOU HEAR LET US GO DOWN TO THE CAVE IN THE ENCLOSURE THAT WE MAY BE SURE THEN WE WILL TELL YOU ALL
THERE WERE SIX OF THESE MEN OMITTING THE WATCHMAN AND AFTERWHILE THEY ASSEMBLED IN A GROUP NEAR THE FIRE SOME SITTING SOME LYING PRONE
FEW MOTHERS PERHAPS HAVE HAD LESS TROUBLE WITH THEIR CHILDREN DURING THEIR MINORITY THAN MYSELF IN GENERAL MY CHILDREN WERE FRIENDLY TO EACH OTHER AND IT WAS VERY SELDOM THAT I KNEW THEM TO HAVE THE LEAST DIFFERENCE OR QUARREL
ALTHOUGH POLYGAMY WAS TOLERATED IN OUR TRIBE THOMAS CONSIDERED IT A VIOLATION OF GOOD AND WHOLESOME RULES IN SOCIETY
BUT THEY NEVER WILL AGAIN CONSENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY RIGHT IN AN USURPER SANGUINARY HAVE BEEN THE INSTRUMENTS OF MY SOVEREIGN'S RULE IN SCOTLAND REPLIED MONTGOMERY BUT SUCH CRUELTY IS FOREIGN TO HIS GALLANT HEART AND WITHOUT OFFENDING THAT HIGH SOULED PATRIOTISM
THUS DID EDWARD ESTABLISH HIMSELF AS THE LIEGE LORD OF THIS KINGDOM AND WHETHER THE OPPRESION WHICH FOLLOWED WERE HIS OR HIS AGENTS IMMEDIATE ACTS IT MATTERS NOT FOR HE MADE THEM HIS OWN BY HIS AFTER CONDUCT
THEY PUT THEIR HANDS INTO HIS AND HE BOUND THEM IN SHACKLES WAS THIS HONOR WAS THIS THE RIGHT OF CONQUEST THE CHEEK OF ALEXANDER WOULD HAVE BLUSHED DEEP AS HIS TYRIAN ROBE AND THE FACE OF CHARLEMAGNE TURNED PALE AS THE LILIES
BY THE SWORD MY ANCESTORS GAINED THEIR ESTATES AND WITH THE SWORD I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO EXTEND MY TERRITORIES
DIRECTLY THE ANGEL CONTINUED FOR UNTO YOU IS BORN THIS DAY IN THE CITY OF DAVID A SAVIOR WHICH IS CHRIST THE LORD AGAIN THERE WAS A REST WHILE THE WORDS SANK INTO THEIR MINDS
SO LONG AS A HOPE OF ITS REFORMATION IS CAPABLE OF STIMULATING A DISAPPOINTED BREAST MY ADVICE AND EXPOSTULATIONS WITH MY SONS WERE ABORTIVE AND YEAR AFTER YEAR THEIR DISAFFECTION FOR EACH OTHER INCREASED
THE VALE WAS COVERED WITH A GROWTH OF SYCAMORE DWARF OAK AND PINE TREES WHILE IN THE GLENS AND RAVINES ADJOINING THERE WERE THICKETS OF OLIVE AND MULBERRY ALL AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR INVALUABLE FOR THE SUPPORT OF SHEEP GOATS AND CATTLE OF WHICH THE WANDERING FLOCKS CONSISTED
WHEN THE SHELIACH READ THE TEXT NONE LISTENED TO THE INTERPRETER WITH MORE ABSOLUTE FAITH AND NONE TOOK AWAY WITH THEM MORE OF THE ELDER'S SERMON OR GAVE IT MORE THOUGHT AFTERWARDS
THE CHRIST THEY ALL REPEATED FALLING UPON THEIR KNEES IN WORSHIP ONE OF THEM REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES OVER IT IS THE LORD AND HIS GLORY IS ABOVE THE EARTH AND HEAVEN AND THE SIMPLE MEN NEVER DOUBTING KISSED THE HEM OF THE MOTHER'S ROBE
SUDDENLY THE LIGHT BECAME INTOLERABLY BRIGHT AND THEY COVERED THEIR EYES AND DROPPED UPON THEIR KNEES THEN AS THEIR SOULS SHRANK WITH FEAR THEY FELL UPON THEIR FACES BLIND AND FAINTING AND WOULD HAVE DIED HAD NOT A VOICE SAID TO THEM FEAR NOT
WHEN THEY WERE EXPANDED MANY CUBITS BEYOND HIS STATURE HE AROSE LIGHTLY AND WITHOUT EFFORT FLOATED OUT OF VIEW TAKING THE LIGHT UP WITH HIM LONG AFTER HE WAS GONE DOWN FROM THE SKY FELL THE REFRAIN IN MEASURE MELLOWED BY DISTANCE
AND TO CONDUCT LIKE A WILD OR CRAZY MAN WITHOUT REGARD TO RELATIVES DECENCY OR PROPRIETY AT SUCH TIMES HE OFTEN THREATENED TO TAKE MY LIFE FOR HAVING RAISED A WITCH AS HE CALLED JOHN
THEY ROSE UPON THEIR KNEES AND LOOKING WORSHIPFULLY BEHELD IN THE CENTRE OF A GREAT GLORY THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN CLAD IN A ROBE INTENSELY WHITE
AND THAT WAS OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE SHEPHERDS WHO DROVE THEIR CHARGES THITHER THAN THE HOUSE ITSELF THE STONE WALL AROUND THE LOT WAS HIGH AS A MAN'S HEAD YET NOT SO HIGH BUT THAT SOMETIMES A PANTHER OR A LION HUNGERING FROM THE WILDERNESS LEAPED BOLDLY IN
CAUGHT ONE OF THEM BEFORE THEY WERE APPRIZED OF DANGER AND CONDUCTED HIM TO THE CAMP HE WAS WELL TREATED WHILE A PRISONER AND REDEEMED AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR
THEY CONSIDERED THOMAS TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TRANSGRESSOR AND THAT FOR THE ABUSES WHICH HE HAD OFFERED HE HAD MERITED FROM JOHN THE TREATMENT THAT HE HAD RECEIVED JOHN ON LEARNING THE DECISION OF THE COUNCIL RETURNED TO HIS FAMILY
IT WAS TO ENLIVEN AND SHARE HIS WANDERINGS IN ITS DEFENSE HE MIGHT BE CALLED ON TO FACE THE LION OR ROBBER TO DIE THE GREAT EVENTS SUCH AS BLOTTED OUT NATIONS AND CHANGED THE MASTERY OF THE WORLD
LEAVING THE ARMS EXPOSED BROAD BELTS GIRTHED THE RUDE GARMENTS TO THEIR WAISTS THEIR SANDALS WERE OF THE COARSEST QUALITY FROM THEIR RIGHT SHOULDERS HUNG SCRIPS CONTAINING FOOD AND SELECTED STONES FOR SLINGS WITH WHICH THEY WERE ARMED
I BELIEVE I NEVER SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOU IN ARMS AGAINST SCOTLAND BUT I WILL REMOVE THEM BY A SIMPLE ANSWER ALL THE PRINCES WHOM YOU SPEAK OF EXCEPTING BRUCE OF ANNANDALE DID ASSENT TO THE NEWLY OFFERED CLAIM OF EDWARD ON SCOTLAND BUT WHO AMONGST THEM
THE HERDS RUSHED TOGETHER BEWILDERED THE MEN CLAMBERED TO THEIR FEET WEAPONS IN HAND WHAT IS IT THEY ASKED IN ONE VOICE SEE CRIED THE WATCHMAN THE SKY IS ON FIRE
AND WHEN HE RETURNED BROUGHT ONE WHITE MAN A PRISONER WHOM HE HAD TAKEN WITH HIS OWN HANDS
NO ONE CAN CONCEIVE OF THE CONSTANT TROUBLE THAT I DAILY ENDURED ON THEIR ACCOUNT ON THE ACCOUNT OF MY TWO OLDEST SONS WHOM I LOVED EQUALLY AND WITH ALL THE FEELINGS AND AFFECTION OF A TENDER MOTHER STIMULATED BY AN ANXIOUS CONCERN FOR THEIR FATE
INDECENT AND UNBECOMING A GENTLEMAN AND AS HE NEVER COULD RECONCILE HIMSELF TO IT HE WAS FREQUENTLY ALMOST CONSTANTLY WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER TALKING TO HIM ON THE SAME SUBJECT
AND BEFORE THIS DAY MONTH NOT A ROOD OF LAND IN SCOTLAND IS LIKELY TO HOLD A SOUTHRON SOLDIER
POURED INTO MY CUP OF AFFLICTIONS FILLING IT EVEN TO OVERFLOWING AND BLASTING ALL MY PROSPECTS AS SOON AS I HAD RECOVERED A LITTLE FROM THE SHOCK WHICH I FELT AT THE SIGHT OF MY DEPARTED SON
ON THE SPOT WHERE HE WAS KILLED NO ONE CAN JUDGE OF MY FEELINGS ON SEEING THIS MOURNFUL SPECTACLE AND WHAT GREATLY ADDED TO MY DISTRESS WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD FALLEN BY THE MURDEROUS HAND OF HIS BROTHER I FELT MY SITUATION UNSUPPORTABLE
HAVING PASSED THROUGH VARIOUS SCENES OF TROUBLE OF THE MOST CRUEL AND TRYING KIND I HAD HOPED TO SPEND MY FEW REMAINING DAYS IN QUIETUDE AND TO DIE IN PEACE SURROUNDED BY MY FAMILY THIS FATAL EVENT HOWEVER SEEMED TO BE A STREAM OF WOE
SWORE TO THE FALSEHOOD OTHERS REMAINED GLOOMILY SILENT AND THE BRAVEST OF THEM RETIRED TO THE HIGHLANDS WHERE THEY DWELL AMONGST THEIR MOUNTAINS TILL THE CRIES OF SCOTLAND CALLED THEM AGAIN TO FIGHT HER BATTLES
THOMAS EXCEPT WHEN INTOXICATED WHICH WAS NOT FREQUENT WAS A KIND AND TENDER CHILD WILLING TO ASSIST ME IN MY LABOR
IT WAS TO SAY THAT NEWS HAD REACHED HIM OF WALLACE'S DESIGN TO ATTACK THE CASTLES GARRISONED BY ENGLAND ON THE EASTERN COAST SHOULD THIS INFORMATION PROVE TRUE HE THE PRINCE DECLARED THAT AS A PUNISHMENT FOR SUCH INCREASING AUDACITY
THIS IS THE TRUE STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND THOUGH I WISH NOT TO MAKE A SUBJECT OUTRAGE HIS SOVEREIGN YET TRUTH DEMANDS OF YOU TO SAY TO EDWARD THAT TO WITHDRAW HIS PRETENSIONS FROM THIS EXHAUSTED COUNTRY IS THE RESTITUTION WE MAY JUSTLY CLAIM IS ALL THAT WE WISH
THERE HE HAD BUILT A HUT AND PLANTED A GARDEN WITH POTATOES AND OTHER VEGETABLES FLESH MEAT HE OBTAINED FROM THE KANGAROOS AND SEALS THEIR SKINS HE TOOK TO LAUNCESTON IN HIS BOAT
EVERY FEW MOMENTS I WOULD STOP AND KNEEL BEFORE BRIGITTE WHO WOULD CALL ME AN IDLER
WHEN I SPOKE OF OUR DEPARTURE SHE AROSE COLD AND RESIGNED AND CONTINUED HER PREPARATIONS WHEN I SWORE TO HER THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE HAPPY AND THAT I WOULD CONSECRATE MY LIFE TO HER
THESE FARMS WERE VERY VALUABLE IN THE DAYS OF THE LATE BOOM AND ARE CALLED THE CITY OF MELBOURNE BATMAN WANTED TO OUST THE NEWCOMERS HE CLAIMED THE FARMS UNDER HIS GRANT FROM THE JAGGA JAGGAS
AS THOUGH ASTONISHED TO SEE ME IN SUCH A PLACE FOR I WAS ELEGANTLY ATTIRED LITTLE BY LITTLE SHE APPROACHED MY TABLE AND SEEING THAT ALL THE BOTTLES WERE EMPTY SMILED
FOR EIGHT DAYS WE SPENT OUR TIME MAKING PURCHASES AND PREPARING FOR OUR DEPARTURE THEN A YOUNG MAN PRESENTED HIMSELF AT OUR APARTMENTS HE BROUGHT LETTERS TO BRIGITTE
AND ADMIRATION AND LOVE RESUMED THEIR SWAY IN MY HEART BRIGITTE AND I EXAMINED A MAP TO DETERMINE WHERE WE SHOULD GO TO BURY OURSELVES FROM THE WORLD WE HAD NOT YET DECIDED
HE HAD OBTAINED THREE COPIES OF THE GRANT SIGNED BY THREE BROTHERS JAGGA JAGGA BY BUNGAREE YAN YAN MOORWHIP AND MARMARALLAR
A SINGULAR IMPUDENCE MINGLED WITH PITY THAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IF SHE HAD TAKEN MY HAND IN THE STREET SHE WOULD HAVE INSPIRED A FEELING OF HORROR IN ME
HOW CAN ANY ONE ENDURE THOSE GRILLED WINDOWS AND THAT HORRIBLE BROWN COLOR WITH WHICH ALL THE HOUSES ARE SOILED WHAT COULD WE DO AT ROME WE ARE NOT TRAVELING IN ORDER TO FORGET OURSELVES
NINE FREE WOMEN AND THEIR TWENTY TWO CHILDREN AND A CREW OF TWENTY SIX SEVERAL SHIPS HAD BEEN WRECKED ON KING'S ISLAND
SO ANXIOUS WAS I TO PROVE THE SINCERITY OF MY LOVE FOR BRIGITTE THAT I HARDLY DARED KISS THE HEM OF HER DRESS HER LIGHTEST WORDS MADE ME TREMBLE AS THOUGH HER VOICE WAS STRANGE TO ME
BUT WERE NOT BOURGEOIS IN SHORT THEY BELONGED TO THAT AMBIGUOUS CLASS
THEY DISEMBARKED ON ITS BANKS PLOUGHED SOME LAND SOWED MAIZE AND WHEAT AND PLANTED TWO THOUSAND FRUIT TREES THEY WERE NOT SO GRASPING AS BATMAN AND EACH MAN PEGGED OUT A FARM OF ONLY ONE HUNDRED ACRES
ALTHOUGH STILL PALE FROM THE SORROWS OF THE PAST HAPPY PROJECTS OF FUTURE JOY YOU ARE PERHAPS THE ONLY TRUE HAPPINESS KNOWN TO MAN
HE WOULD TURN OVER AND CONTINUE TO SLEEP AND I I DO NOT SLEEP I CONTINUED PACING UP AND DOWN THE STREET I DO NOT SLEEP I
THE OCEAN OF EVIL THAT SURROUNDS US AND IS CONTENT TO HANG A SMALL BLACK FRUIT ALONG OUR PATHS SINCE THAT MAN SLEEPS SO SOUNDLY ON HIS BENCH WHY DO NOT I SLEEP ON MINE
ONE IS A MONK AND ANOTHER A SOLDIER FLORENCE IS SAD IT IS THE MIDDLE AGES LIVING IN THE MIDST OF MODERN LIFE
AFTER THEIR INTERVIEW I FOUND HER SAD AND DISTRAUGHT BUT I COULD NOT GUESS THE CAUSE UNLESS THE LETTERS WERE FROM N
ON ARRIVING AT THE HUT SCOTT AND HIS LUBRAS PREPARED FOR THEIR GUESTS A BEAUTIFUL MEAL OF KANGAROO AND POTATOES THIS WAS THEIR ONLY FOOD AS LONG AS THEY REMAINED ON KING'S ISLAND FOR SCOTT'S ONLY BOAT HAD GOT ADRIFT
AND I WILL WHISPER TO YOU THAT NOT LONG SINCE I LOVED A TERRIBLE FELLOW WHO MADE ME VERY UNHAPPY YOU WILL REPROVE ME AND CLOSE MY MOUTH AND WE WILL AGREE
AND THAT I WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING AND ALL SORTS OF PROJECTS FLITTED THROUGH OUR MINDS SICILY WAS FAR AWAY BUT THE WINTERS ARE SO DELIGHTFUL THERE
THEY WERE ONLY ELEVEN ALL TOLD AND WERE ADVANCING SLOWLY NOW THEY SAW THAT SEVEN OF THE ELEVEN WERE SMALL ONLY PICANINNIES
PERHAPS BEFORE I KNEW YOU ANOTHER WOMAN MIGHT HAVE CURED ME BUT NOW YOU ALONE OF ALL THE WORLD HAVE POWER TO DESTROY ME OR TO SAVE ME
AND I FORCED THE WINE DOWN AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED BY A PHYSICIAN TO SAVE MY LIFE THE HEAVY FUMES OF THE LIQUOR WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS ADULTERATED MOUNTED TO MY HEAD
IS IT TRUE THAT I AM YOURS YES FAR FROM THIS ODIOUS WORLD IN WHICH YOU HAVE GROWN OLD BEFORE YOUR TIME YES MY CHILD YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE I WILL HAVE YOU SUCH AS YOU ARE
SEA SICKNESS NEARLY KILLED HIM SO HE STAYED BEHIND WHILE THE OTHER ADVENTURERS WENT AND LAID THE FOUNDATION THEY FIRST EXAMINED THE SHORES OF WESTERN PORT THEN WENT TO PORT PHILIP BAY AND ENTERED THE RIVER YARRA
I STOPPED BEFORE THE SLEEPER WHAT SLEEP I SAID SURELY THIS MAN DOES NOT DREAM HIS CLOTHES ARE IN TATTERS HIS CHEEKS ARE WRINKLED HIS HANDS HARDENED WITH TOIL
O MY GOOD BRAVE MISTRESS YOU HAVE MADE A MAN OUT OF A CHILD
IN THIS SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE BATMAN WENT TO PORT PHILLIP WITH A FEW FRIENDS AND SEVEN SYDNEY BLACKFELLOWS
SHE SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER ROOM AND WEPT WHEN I KISSED HER
IS SAID TO BE AS GOOD AS BREAD IN THE MONTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE HEAVY GALES WERE BLOWING OVER KING'S ISLAND FOR FOURTEEN DAYS THE SCHOONER ELIZABETH WITH WHALERS FOR PORT FAIRY
GOD THE JUICE OF A GRAPE CRUSHED UNDER THE FOOT SUFFICES TO DISSIPATE THE DEEPEST SORROW AND TO BREAK ALL THE INVISIBLE THREADS THAT THE FATES WEAVE ABOUT OUR PATHWAY WE WEEP LIKE WOMEN WE SUFFER LIKE MARTYRS
AND WE FOUND PLEASURE IN THAT VERY UNCERTAINTY WHILE GLANCING OVER THE MAP WE SAID WHERE SHALL WE GO WHAT SHALL WE DO WHERE SHALL WE BEGIN LIFE ANEW
WHICH TAKES POSSESSION OF THE HEART ON THE EVE OF A LONG JOURNEY
AND LEAVE EVERYTHING FOR ME AS I FELT MYSELF UNWORTHY OF THE DEVOTION SHE EXHIBITED I WISHED TO REQUITE HER BY MY LOVE AT LAST MY GOOD ANGEL HAD TRIUMPHED
WHO HAD SAVED HIM FROM FURTHER FLOGGING AT THIS TIME ALSO CAPTAIN FRIEND OF THE WHALING CUTTER SARAH ANN TOOK SHELTER UNDER THE LEE OF NEW YEAR'S ISLAND AND HE PULLED ASHORE TO VISIT SCOTT THE SEALER
WHEN THEY CAME NEARER THREE OUT OF THE OTHER FOUR WERE SEEN TO BE LUBRAS AND THE ELEVENTH INDIVIDUAL THEN RESOLVED HIMSELF INTO A WHITE SAVAGE WHO ROARED OUT
AND WITH THE FLINT AND STEEL THEY STRUCK A LIGHT AND MADE A FIRE WHEN THEY WENT DOWN TO THE BEACH IN SEARCH OF SHELLFISH ONE MAN KEPT GUARD AT THE BARRICADE AND LOOKED OUT FOR THE BLACKFELLOWS HIS MUSKET WAS LOADED WITH POWDER AND PEBBLES
HE AFTERWARDS CLAIMED TO BE THE FOUNDER OF MELBOURNE HE COULD WRITE AND TALK EVERLASTINGLY
ONE HAS TO TRAVEL LIKE AN ARMY ON THE MARCH AND MAY EXPECT EVERYTHING EXCEPT REPOSE LET US GO TO SWITZERLAND TOO MANY PEOPLE GO THERE
NEVERTHELESS OUR PREPARATIONS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY AND I BECAME IMPATIENT TO GET AWAY AT THE SAME TIME I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD HARDLY REST
IT WAS NOW NOTHING BUT DREAMS OF HAPPINESS AND VOWS OF ETERNAL LOVE I WISHED ONCE FOR ALL TO MAKE MY DEAR MISTRESS FORGET ALL THE SUFFERING I HAD CAUSED HER
AND BY THE TWENTY FIFTH OF THE SAME MONTH HE HAD COMPILED A REPORT OF HIS EXPEDITION WHICH HE SENT TO GOVERNOR ARTHUR TOGETHER WITH A COPY OF THE GRANT OF LAND EXECUTED BY THE BLACK CHIEFS
SOME SAY IT IS DEATH PASSING OVER THE HEAD BUT IT WAS NOT DEATH THAT PASSED OVER MINE IT WAS THE MALADY OF THE AGE
WHEN I TOLD HER THAT NOTHING HAD YET BEEN DONE THAT IT WAS NOT TOO LATE TO RENOUNCE OUR PLANS SHE FROWNED SEVERELY WHEN I BEGGED HER TO OPEN HER HEART TO ME
I KNOW NOT WHETHER IT IS WITH JOY OR WITH FEAR THAT I TREMBLE I AM ABOUT TO CARRY OFF MY TREASURE DIE MY YOUTH DIE ALL MEMORIES OF THE PAST DIE ALL CARES AND REGRETS
THE ONLY CHEST THAT CAME ASHORE UNBROKEN WAS THAT OF ROBINSON THE APPRENTICE AND IN IT THERE WAS A CANISTER OF POWDER A FLINT MUSKET WAS ALSO FOUND AMONG THE WRECKAGE
THEN RETURNED AND RESUMED MY SEAT I COULD NOT LEAVE THAT DOOR AT WHICH I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOCKED FOR AN EMPIRE
BUT SPAIN
HE MUTTERED A FEW WORDS IN A DAZED MANNER AND THEN BEGAN TO SING HE WAS SO MUCH UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIQUOR THAT HE WALKED AT TIMES ON ONE SIDE OF THE GUTTER AND THEN ON THE OTHER
GENOA IS VERY PRETTY WITH ITS PAINTED HOUSES ITS GREEN GARDENS AND THE APENNINES IN THE BACKGROUND BUT WHAT NOISE WHAT CROWDS OUT OF EVERY THREE MEN ON THE STREET
I COULD SEE THE LIGHTS IN HER ROOM I COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF HER PIANO AT TIMES I SAW SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A SHADOW THROUGH THE PARTIALLY DRAWN CURTAINS
MY RIVAL IS DOUBTLESS PASSING THE NIGHT WITH MY MISTRESS HE WILL LEAVE HER AT DAYBREAK SHE WILL ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE DOOR AND THEY WILL SEE ME ASLEEP ON MY BENCH
I RAN HITHER AND THITHER KNOCKING AT THE DOORS OF TAVERNS CRYING WINE WINE AT LAST I FOUND ONE OPEN I CALLED FOR A BOTTLE
BRIGITTE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE LAKE
I ALTERNATED BETWEEN TEARS AND LAUGHTER AND I NEVER SPOKE OF THE PAST EXCEPT WITH HORROR AND DISGUST OUR ROOM WAS FULL OF OUR GOODS SCATTERED ABOUT IN DISORDER
THEIR KISSES WILL NOT AWAKEN ME AND THEY WILL SHAKE ME BY THE SHOULDER I WILL TURN OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE AND SLEEP ON THUS INSPIRED BY A FIERCE JOY
AND ROBINSON AN APPRENTICE COVERED THE WOMEN AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH SOME PIECES OF SAIL AND BLANKETS SOAKED WITH SALT WATER THE MEN WALKED ABOUT THE BEACH ALL NIGHT TO KEEP THEMSELVES WARM
YOU HAVE DRUNK LIKE THE CHILD THAT YOU ARE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU WERE DOING SIT DOWN IN THIS CHAIR AND WAIT UNTIL A CAB PASSES YOU WILL TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE AND I WILL ORDER THE DRIVER TO TAKE YOU HOME TO YOUR MOTHER
I WOULD NOT TOUCH YOU WITH THE TIP OF MY FINGER WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE REPLY AT ONCE IS IT MONEY YOU WANT WHAT PRICE DO YOU PUT ON YOUR PITY I AROSE AND TRIED TO GO OUT
ALBUMS PICTURES BOOKS AND THE DEAR MAP WE LOVED SO MUCH
AND IN IT HE BROUGHT BACK SUPPLIES OF FLOUR AND GROCERIES HE HAD OBSERVED DEAD BODIES OF WOMEN AND MEN AND PIECES OF A WRECKED VESSEL CAST UP BY THE SEA
THEN CONSCIOUSNESS LEFT ME I LEANED MY ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND SAID ADIEU TO MYSELF BUT I HAD A CONFUSED IDEA THAT I WAS NOT ALONE IN THE TAVERN
FINALLY HE FELL ON A BENCH FACING ANOTHER HOUSE OPPOSITE ME THERE HE LAY STILL SUPPORTED ON HIS ELBOWS AND SLEPT PROFOUNDLY THE STREET WAS DESERTED
SCOTT AND HIS HOUNDS HUNTED THE KANGAROO AND SUPPLIED THE COLONY WITH MEAT THE LIVER OF THE KANGAROO WHEN BOILED AND LEFT TO GROW COLD IS A DRY SUBSTANCE WHICH WITH THE HELP OF HUNGER AND A LITTLE IMAGINATION
I SAW THAT SHE HAD FINE TEETH OF BRILLIANT WHITENESS I TOOK HER HAND AND BEGGED HER TO BE SEATED SHE CONSENTED WITH GOOD GRACE AND ASKED WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE FOR SUPPER
SINCE SHE ADDED YOU REALLY FIND ME UGLY AS SHE SPOKE I RAISED MY EYES PERHAPS MY DRUNKENNESS DECEIVED ME OR PERHAPS I HAD NOT SEEN HER FACE CLEARLY BEFORE
NEVER TO SPEAK OF SUCH THINGS WHEN BRIGITTE SPOKE THUS I EXPERIENCED A FEELING THAT RESEMBLED AVARICE I CAUGHT HER IN MY ARMS AND CRIED O GOD
AND IT WAS SHE WHO WITH HER PALE HALF MOCKING FEATURES
ALREADY LAUSANNE VEVAY OBERLAND AND BEYOND THE SUMMITS OF MONTE ROSA AND THE IMMENSE PLAIN OF LOMBARDY ALREADY OBLIVION REPOSE FLIGHT
SHE OBSERVED MY EMOTION AND INQUIRED THE CAUSE I COULD NOT REPLY SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD SOME SECRET SORROW AND FOREBORE ANY ATTEMPT TO LEARN THE CAUSE
AND WE SIT DOWN IN OUR TEARS AS DID ADAM AT EDEN'S GATE AND IN ORDER TO CURE OUR WOUND WE HAVE BUT TO MAKE A MOVEMENT OF THE HAND AND MOISTEN OUR THROATS
FOR IT HAS SEEN OUR WOES
I SET OUT IN QUEST OF A TAVERN AS IT WAS PAST MIDNIGHT SOME WERE CLOSED THAT PUT ME IN A FURY WHAT I CRIED EVEN THAT CONSOLATION IS REFUSED ME
BUT THE FLASH AND REPORT WOULD BE SURE TO STRIKE THEM WITH TERROR AND PUT THEM TO FLIGHT BY THIS TIME THEIR DIET OF SHELLFISH HAD LEFT THEM ALL WEAK AND EMACIATED SKELETONS ONLY JUST ALIVE
AND HIS FLOUR TEA AND SUGAR HAD BEEN ALL CONSUMED BUT KANGAROO BEEF AND POTATOES SEEMED A MOST LUXURIOUS DIET TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN KEPT ALIVE FOR THREE WEEKS ON NOTHING BUT SHELLFISH
JOSEPH BENNET THOMAS SHARP JOHN WATSON EDWARD CALTHORP THOMAS HINES ROBERT BALLARD JOHN ROBINSON
MY MISSION WILL HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE THANKFUL FOR IT FINALLY WE DECIDED TO GO TO GENEVA AND THEN CHOOSE SOME RESTING PLACE IN THE ALPS
THEY WERE DISPUTING OVER A DIRTY PACK OF CARDS AMONG THEM I SAW A GIRL WHO APPEARED TO BE VERY YOUNG AND VERY PRETTY DECENTLY CLAD
REVOLTED AND YET CHARMED WHAT I HAD DONE HAD BEEN DONE SO QUICKLY THAT I SEEMED TO HAVE OBEYED SOME IMPULSE OF DESPAIR
WAS HOVE TO OFF THE COAST STANDING OFF AND ON SIX HOURS ONE WAY AND SIX HOURS THE OTHER AKERS THE CAPTAIN AND HIS MATE GOT DRUNK ON RUM AND WATER DAILY
AND WITHOUT CARING WHETHER IT WAS GOOD OR BAD I GULPED IT DOWN A SECOND FOLLOWED AND THEN A THIRD I DOSED MYSELF AS WITH MEDICINE
THREE WEEKS PASSED AWAY BEFORE ANY OF THE NATIVES APPEARED BUT AT LAST THEY WERE SEEN APPROACHING ALONG THE SHORE FROM THE SOUTH AT THE FIRST ALARM ALL THE SHIP WRECKED PEOPLE RAN TO THE BARRICADE FOR SHELTER
FOR I BEAR ON MY HEART THE WOUND OF ALL THE EVIL I HAVE DONE YOU I HAVE BEEN AN INGRATE BLIND AND CRUEL GOD BE PRAISED YOU LOVE ME STILL
BEING AFRAID TO GO INLAND FOR FEAR OF THE CANNIBAL BLACKFELLOWS IN THE MORNING THEY WENT TO ROUSE THE WOMEN AND FOUND THAT SEVEN OF THE THIRTEEN WERE DEAD THE SURVIVING MEN WERE THE MASTER B H PECK
HOW SHALL I TELL HOW DEEPLY I REPENTED MY CRUELTY WHEN I LOOKED UPON HER SMILING FACE
NOW HIS MISTRESS CAN BETRAY HIM HIS FRIEND CAN GLIDE LIKE A THIEF INTO HIS HUT I COULD SHAKE HIM BY THE SHOULDER AND TELL HIM THAT HE IS BEING MURDERED THAT HIS HOUSE IS ON FIRE
BUT MY FEET REFUSED TO SUPPORT ME AT THE SAME TIME MY EYES FAILED ME A MORTAL WEAKNESS TOOK POSSESSION OF ME AND I FELL OVER A CHAIR YOU ARE NOT WELL SHE SAID TAKING ME BY THE ARM
AND HAD TRAVELLED ALONG THE SHORE WITH HIS FAMILY LOOKING FOR ANYTHING USEFUL OR VALUABLE WHICH THE WRECK MIGHT YIELD AFTER HEARING THE STORY AND SEEING THE MISERABLE PLIGHT OF THE CASTAWAYS HE INVITED THEM TO HIS HOME
HE SQUATTED ON BATMAN'S HILL AND LOOKED DOWN WITH EVIL EYES ON THE RIVAL IMMIGRANTS HE SAW THEM CLEARING AWAY THE SCRUB ALONG FLINDERS STREET AND SPLITTING POSTS AND RAILS ALL OVER THE CITY FROM SPENCER STREET TO SPRING STREET
TO KEEP A BRIGHT LOOK OUT HE SAID KING'S ISLAND IS INHABITED BY ANTHROPOPHAGI THE BLOODIEST MAN EATERS EVER KNOWN AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO POT YOU HAD BETTER KEEP YOUR EYES SKINNED
NEVERTHELESS THIS EVENING HE HAD A PIECE OF MONEY IN HIS POCKET HE ENTERED A TAVERN WHERE HE PURCHASED OBLIVION HE HAS EARNED ENOUGH IN A WEEK TO ENJOY A NIGHT OF SLUMBER
HE IS SOME UNFORTUNATE WHO DOES NOT HAVE BREAD EVERY DAY A THOUSAND GNAWING CARES A THOUSAND MORTAL SORROWS AWAIT HIS RETURN TO CONSCIOUSNESS
BUT SUDDENLY I DETECTED IN THAT UNFORTUNATE A FATAL RESEMBLANCE TO MY MISTRESS I SHUDDERED AT THE SIGHT THERE IS A CERTAIN SHUDDER THAT AFFECTS THE HAIR
IS THERE NOT A WORLD OF MEANING IN THE SIMPLE WORDS ALL IS READY WE ARE ABOUT TO GO SUDDENLY BRIGITTE BECAME LANGUID SHE BOWED HER HEAD AND WAS SILENT
NO MORE SORROW
WHICH HAS NEITHER FORTUNE NOR OCCUPATION WHICH NEVER WORKS EXCEPT AT SOME CRIMINAL PLOT WHICH IS NEITHER POOR NOR RICH
THEN STOPPED AND REPULSED ME AS THOUGH INVOLUNTARILY
AT LAST THEY FOUND A PUNCHEON OF RUM UPENDED IT STOVE IN THE HEAD AND DRANK THE THIRTEEN WOMEN THEN LAY DOWN ON THE SAND CLOSE TOGETHER AND SLEPT THE NIGHT WAS VERY COLD
HE CLAIMED BOTH THE LAND AND THE BLACKS AND IGNORED THE CROWN GRANT
SO THE LOOK OUT MAN DID NOT GO TO SLEEP
THE COOK OF THE INDUSTRY WAS ON BOARD THE ELIZABETH THE MAN WHOM CAPTAIN BLOGG WAS FLOGGING WHEN HIS CREW SEIZED HIM AND THREW HIM OVERBOARD THE COOK ALSO WAS NOW PITCHED OVERBOARD FOR HAVING GIVEN EVIDENCE AGAINST THE FOUR MEN
AND RESEMBLING HER COMPANIONS IN NO WAY EXCEPT IN THE HARSHNESS OF HER VOICE WHICH WAS ROUGH AND BROKEN AS THOUGH IT HAD PERFORMED THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC CRIER SHE LOOKED AT ME CLOSELY
DRAWING HER HANDKERCHIEF SHE DRIED MY TEARS FROM TIME TO TIME AS WE DINED THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT GIRL THAT WAS AT ONCE REPULSIVE AND SWEET
NOT SUSPECTING MY PRESENCE WAS SLEEPING ON THAT STONE BENCH AS PEACEFULLY AS THOUGH IN HIS OWN BED HE SERVED TO DIVERT MY GRIEF I AROSE TO LEAVE HIM IN FULL POSSESSION
THERE HE FOUND THE SHIPWRECKED MEN AND WOMEN WHOM HE TOOK ON BOARD HIS CUTTER AND CONVEYED TO LAUNCESTON EXCEPT ONE WOMAN AND TWO MEN IT WAS THEN TOO LATE IN THE SEASON TO TAKE THE WHALERS TO PORT FAIRY
A PLACE OF SMALL ACCOUNT EVEN TO THIS DAY BATMAN WAS A LONG LIMBED SYDNEY NATIVE AND HE BESTRODE HIS REAL ESTATE LIKE A COLOSSUS BUT KING WILLIAM WAS A BIGGER COLOSSUS THAN BATMAN
THE CANNIBAL BLACKS HAD DISAPPEARED AND CONTINUED TO EXIST ONLY IN THE FANCIES OF THE MARINERS SCOTT'S RESIDENCE WAS OPPOSITE NEW YEAR'S ISLAND NOT FAR FROM THE SHORE
WHO HAD TAKEN UP IS ABODE ON THE ISLAND WITH HIS HAREM THREE TASMANIAN GINS AND SEVEN CHILDREN THEY WERE THE ONLY PERMANENT INHABITANTS
STILL THE LITTLE LIFE LEFT IN THEM WAS PRECIOUS AND THEY RESOLVED TO SELL IT AS DEAR AS THEY COULD THEY WATCHED THE SAVAGES APPROACHING AT LENGTH THEY COULD COUNT THEIR NUMBER
REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT THE GROUND UNDER THEIR FEET WOULD BE IN THE DAYS OF THEIR GRANDCHILDREN WORTH THREE THOUSAND POUNDS PER FOOT THEIR BULLOCK DRAYS WERE OFTEN BOGGED IN ELIZABETH STREET
I HAD WRITTEN MY MISTRESS SAYING THAT I NEVER WISHED TO SEE HER AGAIN I KEPT MY WORD BUT I PASSED THE NIGHTS UNDER HER WINDOW SEATED ON A BENCH BEFORE HER DOOR
FOR THREE WEEKS THESE PEOPLE LIVED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON SHELLFISH THEY THREW UP A BARRICADE ON THE SHORE ABOVE HIGH WATER MARK TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST THE CANNIBALS
EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE B H PECK MASTER DOCTOR STEVENSON R N SURGEON
THE WOMEN WERE ELLEN GALVIN MARY STATING ANN CULLEN ROSA HELAND ROSE DUNN AND MARGARET DRURY
AND THE MEN ARMED THEMSELVES WITH ANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF WEAPONS THEY COULD FIND BUT THEIR MAIN HOPE OF VICTORY WAS THE MUSKET THEY COULD NOT EXPECT TO KILL MANY CANNIBALS WITH ONE SHOT
LOOK CAREFULLY ABOUT THAT DESERTED HOUSE YOU WILL FIND A FANTOM THERE FOR THE MAN WHO LEFT IT AND WENT AWAY WITH YOU IS NOT THE MAN WHO ENTERED IT IS IT TRUE
I SUDDENLY CRIED OUT WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM WHO TOLD YOU TO DRY MY TEARS IS THIS YOUR VOCATION AND DO YOU THINK I DESIRE YOU
HOW PITIABLE OUR GRIEF SINCE IT CAN BE THUS ASSUAGED WE ARE SURPRISED THAT PROVIDENCE DOES NOT SEND ANGELS TO GRANT OUR PRAYERS IT NEED NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE
YOU MET ME AT A BALL I PLEASED YOU AND I LOVE YOU YOU TELL ME THAT SOME LEAGUES DISTANT IN A CERTAIN LITTLE TOWN YOU LOVED A CERTAIN MADAME PIERSON WHAT PASSED BETWEEN YOU AND HER I DO NOT KNOW
ALL THE DELIGHTS OF HAPPY SOLITUDE INVITED US ALREADY WHEN IN THE EVENING WITH JOINED HANDS WE LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN SILENCE WE FELT RISING WITHIN US THAT SENTIMENT OF STRANGE GRANDEUR
BUT IT SEEMED SO STRANGE THAT A CREATURE I HAD NEVER SEEN SHOULD COME TO ME AND WITHOUT A WORD PROCEED TO ORDER SUPPER AND DRY MY TEARS WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF THAT I WAS RENDERED SPEECHLESS
AS I HAD GULPED IT DOWN AT A BREATH DRUNKENNESS SEIZED ME PROMPTLY I FELT THAT I WAS BECOMING MUDDLED THEN I EXPERIENCED A LUCID MOMENT THEN CONFUSION FOLLOWED
I AM SO PROUD AND SO FOOLISH THAT I DARE NOT ENTER A TAVERN AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT IF ALL UNFORTUNATES ENTER THERE IT IS IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY COME OUT HAPPY OH
A DRY WIND SWEPT THE DUST HERE AND THERE THE MOON SHONE THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS AND LIGHTED THE SPOT WHERE THE MAN SLEPT SO I FOUND MYSELF TETE A TETE WITH THIS MAN WHO
AND MOST OF THEM ARE DECEIVED AS TO THE NATURE OF ITS ATTRACTIONS BUT IT IS THERE ARE UNFOLDED THE THREE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLORS ON GOD'S EARTH
WHICH HAS IN IT SOMETHING OF THE TERRORS OF EXILE AND THE HOPES OF A PILGRIMAGE ARE THERE NOT IN THE HUMAN MIND WINGS THAT FLUTTER AND SONOROUS CHORDS THAT VIBRATE HOW SHALL I DESCRIBE IT
MUCH LESS FOR THE SAKE OF INSTRUCTION TO THE RHINE BUT THE SEASON IS OVER AND ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT CARE FOR THE WORLD OF FASHION
CAPTAIN FRIEND WAS APPOINTED CHIEF DISTRICT CONSTABLE AT LAUNCESTON ALL THE CONSTABLES UNDER HIM WERE PRISONERS OF THE CROWN RECEIVING HALF A DOLLAR A DAY
ONE NIGHT AS I WAS SEATED ON THE BENCH PLUNGED IN FRIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY I SAW A BELATED WORKMAN STAGGERING ALONG THE STREET
THE SHARE OF THE CREW OF A WHALING VESSEL WAS ONE FIFTIETH OF THE VALUE OF THE OIL AND BONE THE BOAT STEERER RECEIVED ONE THIRTIETH AND OF THE HEADMEN SOME HAD ONE TWENTY FIFTH OTHERS ONE FIFTEENTH
AND WE TOOK A FURNISHED APARTMENT FOR ONE MONTH THE DECISION TO LEAVE FRANCE HAD CHANGED EVERYTHING
HOW HAD I BEEN ABLE TO RESIST SUCH PROOFS OF TENDER AFFECTION AND COURAGEOUS RESIGNATION NOT ONLY DID BRIGITTE PARDON ME BUT SHE WAS WILLING TO MAKE A STILL GREATER SACRIFICE
AND THE WHITENESS OF THE SNOWS ON THE SUMMITS OF GLACIERS LET US GO LET US GO CRIED BRIGITTE LET US FLY AWAY LIKE TWO BIRDS LET US PRETEND MY DEAR OCTAVE THAT WE JUST MET EACH OTHER YESTERDAY
BUT IT WAS OF GREAT EXTENT LIKE INFINITE SPACE WHOSE CENTRE IS EVERYWHERE AND CIRCUMFERENCE NOWHERE
WHEN I AROSE IN THE MORNING AND THE SUN WAS SHINING THROUGH OUR WINDOWS I EXPERIENCED SUCH TRANSPORTS OF JOY THAT I WAS ALMOST INTOXICATED WITH HAPPINESS
UNSHIPPED HER RUDDER AND PARTED INTO FOUR PIECES ONLY NINE MEN AND THIRTEEN WOMEN REACHED THE ISLAND THEY WERE NEARLY NAKED AND HAD NOTHING TO EAT AND THEY WANDERED ALONG THE BEACH DURING THE NIGHT SEARCHING AMONGST THE WRECKAGE
SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF GREATEST DESPAIR
IT BEGAN IN PARIS SOME NEWSPAPER WOMAN TRIED TO BLACKMAIL HIM AND HE HAD HER PUT IN JAIL FOR THREE MONTHS AND WHEN SHE GOT OUT AGAIN THEN THE PAPERS AT HOME BEGAN TO GET STORIES ABOUT POOR INGHAM'S CUTTING UP
LOOKED TWO LITTLE EYES LIKE THOSE OF A PIG IT WAS ONLY AFTER STUDYING THEM FOR A WHILE THAT ONE DISCOVERED THAT THEY TWINKLED SHREWDLY MISTER GAMBLE WAS ALTOGETHER THE VULGAREST LOOKING PERSONAGE THAT ALICE MONTAGUE HAD EVER MET
AS SHE TOOK THE WEAPON FROM HIM AND HANDED IT TO MISTER BRITTON WHO LAID IT CAREFULLY ON A TABLE NEAR BY AND THEN PROCEEDED TO SEARCH WALCOTT'S CLOTHING SAYING
A MAN'S WIFE IS HIS BETTER HALF AND HIS CHILDREN ARE A GOOD PART OF THE REMAINDER AND WHAT THEY DO OR DON'T DO BECOMES A MATTER OF LEGITIMATE PUBLIC CONCERN AS A MATTER OF FACT A PUBLIC MAN
SIMILARLY WITH THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WHEN THE DAILY FLIM FLAM ASSERTS THAT HE BELIEVES THAT THE WORKING MAN IS ENTITLED TO FOUR CENTS A DAY FOR SIXTEEN HOURS WORK
MISTER GAMBLE PROPOSED THAT THEY VISIT ONE OF THE THEATRES HE HAD A BOX ALL READY IT SEEMED AND OLIVER ACCEPTED FOR ALICE BEFORE MONTAGUE COULD SAY A WORD FOR HER HE SPOKE FOR HIMSELF HOWEVER HE HAD IMPORTANT WORK TO DO AND MUST BE EXCUSED
OR INTERFERE WITH HIS CHANCES OF ELECTION IN THE LEAST TAKE THAT OTHER STORY PUBLISHED IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER THAT ON THE TENTH OF LAST AUGUST THOMPSON BONDIFELLER'S YACHT WAS SEEN ANCHORED FOR SIX HOURS OFF TOM WATSON'S FARM
IF JIM JONES WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ASKED TO PUT HIM THERE
TO THE STILETTO ALREADY PLACED UPON THE TABLE WERE ADDED ANOTHER OF LARGER SIZE TWO LOADED REVOLVERS SEVERAL PACKAGES OF VALUABLE SECURITIES TAKEN FROM THE VAULTS OF THE FIRM THAT AFTERNOON
HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND THE HAND JUST WITHDRAWN FROM HIS COAT DISCLOSED TO VIEW A TINY GLITTERING STILETTO KATE'S ONLY ANXIOUS THOUGHT WAS FOR HER FATHER WHO TOO BEWILDERED TO MOVE OR SPEAK
THE CHIEF TROUBLE WITH HIM IS THAT HE GETS CONFIDENTIAL MONTAGUE RELAPSED INTO SILENCE AND OLIVER CHANGED THE SUBJECT IT SEEMS TOO BAD ABOUT LUCY HE SAID IS THERE NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT
AND HAS REPEATEDLY AVOWED THAT BREAD AND WATER IS THE PROPER FOOD FOR MOTORMEN EVERYBODY WITH COMMON SENSE REALIZES AT ONCE THAT EVEN THE FLIM FLAM DOESN'T BELIEVE THE STORY IT HURTS NO ONE THEREFORE
YOU THINK THAT DO YOU OBSERVED THE BIBLIOMANIAC WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU I FOR ONE AM SICK AND TIRED OF POLITICS AND IT WILL BE A GREAT RELIEF TO ME WHEN IT IS ALL OVER
MADE MY PILE SO TO SPEAK AND GOT OUT I WANT TO SEE THE WORLD A BIT BEFORE I GET TOO OLD THE WAITER CAME TO TAKE THEIR ORDERS IN THE MEANTIME MONTAGUE DARTED AN INDIGNANT GLANCE AT HIS BROTHER WHO SAT AND SMILED SERENELY
HE WENT UPSTAIRS AND SHOOK OFF HIS ANNOYANCE AND PLUNGED INTO HIS WORK SOMETIME AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HE WENT OUT FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR AND AS HE RETURNED HE FOUND OLIVER AND HIS FRIEND STANDING IN THE LOBBY OF THE HOTEL
THE STEEL MAN YOU MEAN ASKED MONTAGUE NO I NEVER MET HIM WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HIM SAID THE OTHER POOR CHAP IT REALLY WAS HARD LUCK YOU KNOW IT WASN'T HIS FAULT DID YOU EVER HEAR THE TRUE STORY NO SAID MONTAGUE
KATE ON LEAVING HER CARRIAGE DIRECTED THE DRIVER TO GO BACK TO THE PINES TO AWAIT MISTER BRITTON'S RETURN AND BRING HIM IMMEDIATELY TO THE OFFICE SHE THEN UNLOCKED THE DOOR TO THE ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN DARRELL'S OFFICE AND WHICH OPENED DIRECTLY UPON THE STREET
BY THE WAY OLIVER REMARKED AFTER A MOMENT THE PRENTICES HAVE ASKED ALICE UP TO NEWPORT ALICE SEEMS TO BE QUITE TAKEN WITH THAT YOUNG CHAP CURTISS HE COMES AROUND A GOOD DEAL SAID MONTAGUE HE SEEMS A VERY DECENT FELLOW
THEN YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN IF UNCLE SAM IS EQUALLY SOLICITOUS ABOUT THE PERSONAL PARAPHERNALIA OF THE MAN WHO ASKS TO OCCUPY HIS LITTLE COTTAGE ON THE POTOMAC SAID THE IDIOT
NO NO SAID OLIVER SMILING CHEERFULLY PURELY SOCIAL HE WANTS TO BE INTRODUCED ABOUT YOU KNOW ARE YOU GOING TO PUT HIM INTO SOCIETY BY ANY CHANCE ASKED THE OTHER SARCASTICALLY
AND SHE AND HER COMPANION ENTERED AND SEATED THEMSELVES IN THE DARKNESS THE ROOM NEXT ADJOINING WAS WALCOTT'S PRIVATE OFFICE AND BEYOND THAT WAS MISTER UNDERWOOD'S PRIVATE OFFICE THE TWO LATTER ROOMS BEING SEPARATED BY A SMALL ENTRANCE
THEN MONTAGUE CAUGHT ALICE'S EYE AND HE COULD ALMOST HEAR HER SAYING TO HIM WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT BUT IT PROVED NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK WITH THE GENTLEMAN FROM PITTSBURG HE APPEARED TO KNOW ALL THE GOSSIP OF THE METROPOLIS
I IMAGINE IT'S NOT A VERY SAVOURY ONE SAID MONTAGUE FOR LACK OF SOMETHING TO SAY IT'S TOO BAD SAID THE OTHER EARNESTLY I HAVE TALKED TO THEM SOMETIMES BUT IT DON'T DO ANY GOOD I REMEMBER DAVIDSON ONE NIGHT
YOU'VE NOTICED THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS I SUPPOSE I HAVE NOTICED THEM SAID MONTAGUE HE IS ADDING SOMETHING OVER A MILLION A MONTH I HEAR IT SOUNDS VERY ATTRACTIVE SAID THE OTHER AND ADDED DRILY
OR AT LEAST THAT THE STORY IS GREATLY EXAGGERATED HE MAY HAVE STUCK A PIN INTO THE COOK AND PLAYED SOME BOYISH TRICK UPON SOME OF HIS RELATIVES BUT THE STORY ON THE FACE OF IT IS UNTRUE AND THEREFORE HARMLESS
YOU SEEM TO HAVE GONE TO A VAST AMOUNT OF LABOR FOR NOTHING HE REMARKED AS MISTER UNDERWOOD CONCLUDED I COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU THAT MUCH INFORMATION OFF HAND YOU HAVE NOT LIVED UP TO YOUR PART OF THE CONTRACT
YOU MUST ADMIT HOWEVER SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC THAT A MAN WITH AN HONORABLE NAME MUST FIND IT UNPLEASANT TO HAVE SUCH OUTRAGEOUS STORIES TOLD OF HIM NOT A BIT OF IT LAUGHED THE IDIOT
AS SHE EXTENDED HER HAND SHE TAUNTINGLY HELD HER WRIST CLOSE TO THE TINY POINT SCARCELY LARGER THAN A GOOD SIZED PIN LIFE AND FREEDOM ARE PRECIOUS SENOR SHE SAID IN LOW MOCKING TONES
THEY SAY HE'S MAKING BARRELS OF MONEY SAID OLIVER THEN HE ADDED LONGINGLY MY GOD I WISH I HAD A TRUST COMPANY TO PLAY WITH WHY A TRUST COMPANY PARTICULARLY ASKED THE OTHER IT'S THE EASIEST GRAFT THAT'S GOING SAID OLIVER
DAVID OLD FRIEND CALM YOURSELF HE EXCLAIMED DON'T BE RASH OR FOOLISH LET THE LAW TAKE ITS COURSE THE LAW INTERPOSED MISTER UNDERWOOD FIERCELY
YOU HAVE ESCAPED THIS TIME WERE MISTER UNDERWOOD'S PARTING WORDS BUT REMEMBER IF YOU EVER AGAIN SEEK TO INJURE ME OR MINE NO POWER ON EARTH CAN SAVE YOU AND I'LL NOT GO INTO THE COURTS EITHER
THEY'RE STUNNING GIRLS I TELL YOU I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET THEM MISTER MONTAGUE I SHOULD BE PLEASED SAID MONTAGUE WRITHING INWARDLY
A FIERCE STRUGGLE ENSUED FOR A MOMENT BETWEEN THE TWO MEN WHICH ENDED IN JOHN BRITTON'S DISARMING HIS FRIEND KATE MEANWHILE KEEPING WALCOTT AT BAY AS HE SOUGHT IN THE MOMENTARY CONFUSION TO EFFECT AN ESCAPE
HE GAVE A SINISTER SMILE BUT BEFORE SHE HAD TAKEN ANOTHER STEP HER COMPANION SPRANG INTO THE ROOM WITH A PIERCING CRY AND INTERCEPTED HER NO NO SENORITA SHE EXCLAIMED DO NOT TOUCH IT MOTHER OF GOD IT IS POISONED
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THAT STORY HAS BEEN PUT FORTH FOR THE PURPOSE OF TURNING THE MAIDEN AUNT NEGRO AND GRANDFATHER VOTES AGAINST HIM YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE EITHER NEVER DID WHAT IS CHARGED AGAINST HIM
WITHOUT THE DISTRESSING SHEDDING OF BLOOD WHICH ATTENDS REAL WAR AND REGARDED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HUMOR I KNOW OF NOTHING THAT TO THE EYE OF AN ORDINARILY KEEN OBSERVER IS MORE PROVOCATIVE OF GOOD HONEST WHOLESOME MIRTH
HIS TIME HAS NOT COME YET SENORITA BUT WHEN IT DOES THIS MUST BE THE HAND SHE LIFTED HER OWN RIGHT HAND WITH A SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT AS SHE SAID THIS AND GLIDED OUT INTO THE DARKNESS AND WAS GONE ERE KATE COULD RECALL HER
I THINK THAT CAN BE VERY EASILY AND QUICKLY DONE MISTER UNDERWOOD WALCOTT REPLIED KATE WHO HAD STATIONED HERSELF IN THE ENTRANCE WHERE SHE HAD A VIEW OF BOTH MEN SAW THE CRUEL LEER THAT ACCOMPANIED WALCOTT'S WORDS
WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT THAT YOUR NAME HAS BEEN PUBLICLY ASSOCIATED WITH HERS I WOULD PROSECUTE YOU FOR THE SCOUNDREL AND BLACK LEG THAT YOU ARE BUT FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR DAUGHTER'S NAME YOU INTEND TO DEAL LENIENTLY WITH ME WALCOTT SNEERED
NOBODY YOU HAVE HEARD OF SAID OLIVER BUT I WANT YOU TO MEET HIM YOU WILL THINK HE'S RATHER QUEER BUT I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU AFTERWARDS TELL ALICE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR HIM MONTAGUE DELIVERED THE MESSAGE AND AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THEY WENT DOWNSTAIRS
BUT YOU NEVER CAN SATISFY A WOMAN AND MISTER GAMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD TOO BAD TOO BAD HE REPEATED WERE YOU IN THE STEEL BUSINESS YOURSELF ASKED MONTAGUE POLITELY NO NO OIL WAS MY LINE
I HAVE A RIGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT I WISH TO VOTE TO PLACE SUCH A LADY AT THE HEAD OF MY OFFICIAL TABLE AT WHITE HOUSE BANQUETS WHERE SHE IS LIKELY SOONER OR LATER TO ENCOUNTER THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR
WHEN A MAN WHO IS NOMINATED FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN JUNE OR JULY CAN EMERGE IN NOVEMBER UNSCATHED IN SPITE OF THE MINUTE SCRUTINY TO WHICH HIMSELF AND HIS RECORD AND THE RECORD OF HIS SISTERS AND HIS COUSINS
OF THE WHOLESALE ROBBERY THE PLANS FOR WHICH WALCOTT HAD SO NEARLY PERFECTED HE KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AS WALCOTT LISTENED THE SNEER ON HIS FACE DEEPENED
THEY HAD WAITED BUT A FEW MOMENTS WHEN MISTER UNDERWOOD'S CARRIAGE STOPPED BEFORE THIS ENTRANCE AND AN INSTANT LATER KATE HEARD HER FATHER'S VOICE DIRECTING THE COACHMAN TO CALL FOR HIM IN ABOUT AN HOUR AS THE KEY TURNED IN THE LOCK SHE HEARD WALCOTT'S VOICE ALSO
AND THE PUBLIC WENT WILD AND THEY MADE HIM RESIGN JUST IMAGINE IT GAMBLE CHUCKLED SO VIOLENTLY THAT HE WAS SEIZED BY A COUGHING SPELL AND HAD TO SIGNAL FOR A GLASS OF WATER
NOTHING SAID THE OTHER SHE IS SIMPLY RUINING HERSELF SAID OLIVER I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET REGGIE MANN TO HAVE HER INTRODUCED TO MISSUS DEVON BUT HE SAYS HE WOULDN'T DARE TO TAKE THE RISK NO I PRESUME NOT SAID MONTAGUE
OUGHT TO BE WARNED BEFOREHAND YOU WOULDN'T YOURSELF RENT A FURNISHED RESIDENCE TO A MAN WHOSE CHILDREN WERE KNOWN TO HAVE BUILT BONFIRES IN THE PARLOR OF THEIR LAST KNOWN HOME WOULD YOU I THINK NOT SMILED THE BIBLIOMANIAC
THAT MODERN CIVILIZATION SO CALLED HAS PRODUCED A COUPLE OF MEN ARE PUT UP FOR THE MOST DIGNIFIED OFFICE KNOWN TO THE WORLD BOTH ARE GENTLEMEN BY BIRTH AND EDUCATION MEN OF HONOR
AND SHE SAVED ME FROM WORSE THAN DEATH IN PREVENTING THE CARRYING OUT OF THE FARCE OF AN ILLEGAL MARRIAGE WITH THAT VILLAIN BY GIVING ME A GLIMPSE OF HIS REAL CHARACTER BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE
HE HAD AN AGREEMENT DRAWN AND SIGNED WHEREBY UPON THE REPAYMENT OF THE FUNDS BELONGING TO HIM AFTER DEDUCTING AN AMOUNT THEREFROM SUFFICIENT TO REPLACE WHAT HE HAD MISAPPROPRIATED HE WAS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY ALTOGETHER
A WEEKOR TWO HAD PASSED WHEN ONE DAY OLIVER CALLED HIS BROTHER ON THE PHONE HAVE YOU OR ALICE ANY ENGAGEMENT THIS EVENING HE ASKED I WANT TO BRING A FRIEND AROUND TO DINNER WHO IS IT INQUIRED MONTAGUE
THE FELLOW WHO DOES THAT MISTER BIB WANTS TO LEAD A DOUBLE LIFE AND THAT IS REPREHENSIBLE THE MAN WHO OFFERS HIMSELF TO THE PEOPLE HASN'T ANY BUSINESS TO TIE A STRING TO ANY PART OF HIM
BEFORE HE HAD COVERED HALF THE SPACE HOWEVER A VOICE RANG THROUGH THE ROOM WITH STARTLING CLEARNESS NOT A STEP FARTHER OR YOU ARE A DEAD MAN
AND PROVOKES A GREAT DEAL OF INNOCENT MIRTH YOU DON'T YOURSELF BELIEVE THAT LAST YARN ABOUT THE PROHIBITION CANDIDATE DO YOU I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY YARN ABOUT HIM SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC THAT HE IS THE OWNER OF A BREWERY UP IN ROCHESTER
WHO SPENT HIS LIFE LOOKING FOR AN HONEST MAN WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT EVERY FOUR YEARS THAT HE COULD SPOT HIM INSTANTLY BY MERELY COMING TO THIS COUNTRY AND TAKING HIS CHOICE FROM AMONG THE SEVERAL CANDIDATES
BUT HIS WIFE AND HIS DAUGHTERS EXCLAIMED THE OTHER OH THAT'S NOT IT THE FAMILY STAYS IN PITTSBURG IT'S ONLY HIMSELF THIS TIME ALL THE SAME OLIVER ADDED AFTER A PAUSE
THAT'S ALL VERY WELL SAID THE OTHER BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO INFLICT SUCH A MAN UPON ALICE OH STUFF SAID OLIVER SHE'LL MEET HIM AT NEWPORT THIS SUMMER ANYWAY
HOW COULD I INTRODUCE HIM ANYWHERE ELSE IF I WASN'T WILLING TO INTRODUCE HIM HERE HE WON'T HURT ALICE HE GAVE HER A GOOD TIME THIS EVENING AND I WAGER SHE'LL LIKE HIM BEFORE HE GETS THROUGH HE'S REALLY A GOOD NATURED CHAP
A SINGLE SCRATCH MEANS DEATH AT SIGHT OF HER WALCOTT'S FACE GREW LIVID YOU FIEND YOU SHE DEVIL HE HISSED THIS IS YOUR DOING IS IT AND HE BURST INTO A TORRENT OF CURSES AND IMPRECATIONS
THE TWO MEN ENTERED AND WENT AT ONCE INTO MISTER UNDERWOOD'S PRIVATE OFFICE MISTER UNDERWOOD IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED TO BUSINESS IN HIS USUAL ABRUPT FASHION MISTER WALCOTT THERE IS NO USE DALLYING OR BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH
MISTER SO AND SO THE CANDIDATE OF THE THISORTHATIC PARTY FOR THE PRESIDENCY IS MARRIED TO AN ESTIMABLE LADY WHO REFERS TO ALL FRENCHMEN AS PARRICIDES BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THEY HAVE COME FROM PARIS
ONCE CALMED MISTER UNDERWOOD NOTWITHSTANDING MISTER BRITTON'S PROTESTATIONS SULLENLY REFUSED TO PROSECUTE WALCOTT TELEPHONING FOR AN ATTORNEY WHO WAS AN OLD TIME AND TRUSTED FRIEND
UNIMAGINATIVE PEOPLE AND THAT WOULD BE DEATH TO PROGRESS NO PEOPLE CAN PROGRESS THAT LACKS IMAGINATION POLITICS IS AN EMERY WHEEL THAT KEEPS OUR WITS POLISHED WELL
AND I SEE NO REASON WHY I SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO FULFIL MINE YOU PROMISED ME YOUR DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE AND THEN SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE SAW FIT WE WILL LEAVE MY DAUGHTER'S NAME OUT OF THIS CONTROVERSY SIR MISTER UNDERWOOD INTERPOSED STERNLY
SHE MET HIM THROUGH A COUSIN OF HERS A NAVAL OFFICER HE HAS BEEN LIVING IN BROOKLYN THIS WINTER HE KNOWS ALL THE NAVY PEOPLE WHAT IS IT ANYWAY DEMANDED MONTAGUE IMPATIENTLY IS IT SOME BUSINESS AFFAIR THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN
JIM SAYS HE A FELLOW GETS A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY AND HE BUYS HIM EVERYTHING HE WANTS UNTIL AT LAST HE BUYS A WOMAN AND THEN HIS TROUBLE BEGINS IF YOU'RE BUYING PICTURES THERE'S AN END TO IT YOU GET YOUR WALLS COVERED SOONER OR LATER
I WANT THIS PARTNERSHIP TERMINATED AT ONCE THERE'S NO USE IN AN HONEST MAN AND A THIEF TRYING TO DO BUSINESS TOGETHER AND THIS INTERVIEW TO NIGHT IS TO FIND THE SHORTEST WAY OF DISSOLVING THE PARTNERSHIP
HE'S GOT BARRELS OF MONEY YOU KNOW AND HE UNDERSTANDS THE SITUATION PERFECTLY HE WON'T MAKE MANY MISTAKES
BE SILENT MISTER BRITTON ORDERED STERNLY AND KATE ACCOMPANIED THE COMMAND WITH AN OMINOUS CLICK OF HER REVOLVER
WHAT MEAN ASKED OLIVER INNOCENTLY THAT MAN EXCLAIMED THE OTHER WHY I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET HIM SAID OLIVER HE IS AN INTERESTING CHAP I AM IN NO MOOD FOR FOOLING SAID HIS BROTHER ANGRILY
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING THE TRUST AND LAST YEAR THEY BOUGHT ME OUT AND NOW I'M SEEING THE WORLD MISTER GAMBLE RELAPSED INTO THOUGHT AGAIN I NEVER WENT IN FOR THAT SORT OF THING MYSELF HE SAID MEDITATIVELY I AM A MARRIED MAN I AM
THAT'S THE STRANGEST ARGUMENT OF ALL HE SAID THE VERY IDEA OF A MAN WHO DELIBERATELY CHOOSES PUBLIC LIFE AS THE SPHERE OF HIS ACTIVITIES SEEKING TO HIDE BEHIND HIS PRIVATE LIFE IS PREPOSTEROUS
WHEN IT IS TOLD TO ME THAT TOM WATSON'S UNCLE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR TOM BECAUSE HE KNOWS TOM DOESN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE SAYS I AM ALMOST INCLINED TO VOTE FOR HIM AS THE UNCLE OF HIS COUNTRY WHEN I HEAR THAT DEBS'S SON AGED THREE
HIS TONES STRANGELY QUIET YES SENOR I HAVE THE PAPERS TO PROVE IT DO YOU ADMIT IT HE DEMANDED OF WALCOTT WITH A GLANCE WHICH MADE THE LATTER QUAIL WHILE HIS HAND SOUGHT ONE OF THE LOADED REVOLVERS LYING ON THE TABLE
MISTER GAMBLE COMES FROM PITTSBURG INTERPOSED OLIVER INDEED SAID MONTAGUE STRIVING TO MAKE CONVERSATION ARE YOU IN BUSINESS THERE NO I AM OUT OF BUSINESS SAID MISTER GAMBLE WITH A SMILE
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE THAT NO ONE PRESENT HAD EVER HEARD THERE BEFORE ILLEGAL PAPA BECAUSE THIS WOMAN IS HIS LAWFUL WIFE AND KATE GAVE A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE SITUATION IS THAT SO HE APPEALED TO THE WOMAN
HE PUT OUT THE EYES OF A MAIDEN AUNT WITH A RED HOT POKER AND STABBED A NEGRO COOK IN THE BACK WITH A SKEWER BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO PUT RAT POISON IN HIS GRANDFATHER'S COFFEE
IF HE HAD THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF THE FACT THAT ALL HIS CONVERSATION WAS NOT SUPREMELY INTERESTING TO MONTAGUE AND HIS COUSIN HE GAVE NO HINT OF IT AFTER HE HAD DISPOSED OF THE ELABORATE DINNER WHICH OLIVER ORDERED
MONTAGUE SAW HIM CLAMBER LABORIOUSLY INTO HIS AUTOMOBILE AND THEN HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER
AND BACKS FIFTEEN SALOONS AND A POOL ROOM IN NEW YORK SAID THE IDIOT OF COURSE I DON'T SAID THE BIBLIOMANIAC WHO DOES NOBODY SAID THE IDIOT AND THEREFORE THE STORY DOESN'T HURT THE MAN'S REPUTATION A BIT
I FEEL THAT POSSIBLY THERE IS A FAMILY AVERAGE THERE THAT MAY BE STRUCK TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE COUNTRY SAY MISTER IDIOT PUT IN THE POET AT THIS POINT WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR ANYHOW
THEY'VE GOT A NEW SCANDAL ON THEIR HANDS NOW SAID OLIVER THEY'RE A LIVELY CROWD THE STEEL FELLOWS LAUGHED THE OTHER THEY WANT TO MAKE DAVIDSON RESIGN TOO BUT HE'LL FIGHT THEM HE KNOWS TOO MUCH YOU SHOULD HEAR HIS STORY
IT'S A SHAME SAID OLIVER I THOUGHT MISSUS BILLY ALDEN WOULD ASK HER TO NEWPORT THIS SUMMER BUT NOW I DON'T BELIEVE SHE'LL HAVE A THING TO DO WITH HER LUCY WILL FIND SHE KNOWS NOBODY EXCEPT STANLEY RYDER AND HIS CROWD
DON'T ASK ME LAUGHED THE IDIOT I DON'T KNOW YET I ADMIRE ALL THE CANDIDATES PERSONALLY VERY MUCH BUT WHAT ARE YOUR POLITICS REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC ASKED THE LAWYER OH THAT'S DIFFERENT SAID THE IDIOT
I SUPPOSE RYDER FEELS AS IF HE OWNED IT ALL HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL OWN IT WAS THE REPLY IF I WERE GOING INTO WALL STREET TO MAKE MONEY I'D RATHER HAVE THE CONTROL OF FIFTY MILLIONS THAN THE ABSOLUTE OWNERSHIP OF TEN
THE GLEAM OF THE WEAPON NOW PARTIALLY CONCEALED BY THE FOLDS OF HER SKIRT WITH NOISELESS CAT LIKE STEP SHE APPROACHED KATE AND TOUCHED HER ARM YOU WILL NOT SHOOT YOU WILL NOT KILL HIM
RETURNED THE IDIOT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN DOES NOT KEEP YOUR NERVE CENTRES IN A CONSTANT STATE OF PLEASURABLE TITILLATION WHY TO ME IT IS WHAT A BAG FULL OF NUTS MUST BE TO A SQUIRREL
CAN HAVE NO PRIVATE LIFE THEN YOU APPROVE OF THESE STORIES OF CANDIDATES COUSINS THE PRATTLING ANECDOTES OF THEIR GRANDCHILDREN THESE PARAGRAPHS NARRATING THE DOINGS OF THEIR UNCLES IN LAW AND ALL THAT SNEERED THE BIBLIOMANIAC
AND ONE WOMAN IS ENOUGH FOR ME IS YOUR FAMILY IN NEW YORK ASKED MONTAGUE IN AN EFFORT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT NO NO THEY LIVE IN PITTSBURG WAS THE ANSWER I'VE GOT FOUR DAUGHTERS ALL IN COLLEGE
HE PUT OUT A FAT LITTLE HAND TO HER AND SHE TOUCHED IT GINGERLY AND THEN GAZED AT OLIVER AND HIS BROTHER IN HELPLESS DISMAY GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING HE BEGAN VOLUBLY
MY GOD BUT I'M TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE OTHER PROTESTED THAT YOUR FRIENDS WILL STAND FOR A MAN LIKE THAT SOME OF THEM WILL
I FAIRLY GLOAT OVER THESE QUADRENNIAL POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS OF OURS THEY ARE TO ME AMONG THE MOST EXHILARATING INSTITUTIONS OF MODERN LIFE THEY SATISFY ALL ONE'S ZEST FOR WARFARE
THE CHANGE THAT PASSED OVER MISTER UNDERWOOD'S COUNTENANCE DURING KATE'S WORDS WAS FEARFUL TO SEE
YOU ARE WARM AS THE CHILDREN SAY LAUGHED HIS BROTHER MONTAGUE STARED AT HIM OLIVER YOU DON'T MEAN IT HE SAID THAT FELLOW IN SOCIETY
SO IT HAPPENS THAT WHEN A MAN RUNS FOR THE PRESIDENCY THE PERSONS WHO INTRUDE UPON HIS PRIVATE LIFE AS YOU PUT IT ARE CONFERRING A REAL SERVICE UPON THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS WHEN I HEAR FROM AN AUTHENTIC SOURCE THAT
MEN WHO YOU WOULD THINK WOULD SCORN BASENESS AS THEY HATE POISON AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS FOR THREE WEARY MONTHS THE FOLLOWERS OF EACH ATTACK THE CHARACTER AND INTELLIGENCE OF THE OTHER
I AM ALL RIGHT SHE CRIED BRIGHTLY LOOK AFTER PAPA FIRST THEN WE WILL ATTEND TO THIS CREATURE WITH THE REVOLVER STILL LEVELLED AT WALCOTT KATE SLOWLY ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM GIVE ME THAT WEAPON SHE DEMANDED
AND A NEARLY COMPLETE SET OF DUPLICATE KEYS TO THE SAFES AND DEPOSIT BOXES OF THE OFFICES MISTER BRITTON THEN RELIEVED KATE CONGRATULATING HER WARMLY AND STATIONED HIMSELF NEAR WALCOTT WHO GLOWERED LIKE A WILD BEAST THAT
SUPPOSING WE COME AT ONCE TO THE POINT OF DISSOLVING OUR PARTNERSHIP IT CANNOT BE DONE ANY TOO QUICKLY FOR ME MAY I INQUIRE ON WHAT TERMS YOU PROPOSE TO SETTLE
IT'S PREPOSTEROUS ON THE FACE OF IT SAID MISTER BIB WELL THAT'S THE WAY THE THING WORKS SAID THE IDIOT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF BULLY GOOD FUN TO BE HAD OUT OF A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN
IN THE RECEPTION ROOM THEY MET OLIVER AND HIS FRIEND AND IT WAS ALL THAT MONTAGUE COULD DO TO REPRESS A LOOK OF CONSTERNATION THE NAME OF THE PERSONAGE WAS MISTER GAMBLE
SHE BREATHED RATHER THAN WHISPERED KATE'S ONLY REPLY WAS TO LAY HER FINGER ON HER LIPS NEVER REMOVING HER EYES FROM WALCOTT'S FACE BUT EVEN THEN IN HER ABSORPTION SHE NOTED A PECULIAR QUALITY IN THOSE SCARCELY AUDIBLE TONES
CERTAINLY I DO SAID THE IDIOT WHEN I HEAR THAT JUDGE TORKIN'S GRANDSON AGED FOUR HAS COME OUT FOR HIS GRANDFATHER'S OPPONENT I AM DELIGHTED AND GIVE THE JUDGE CREDIT FOR THE INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHICH HEREDITY ACCOUNTS FOR
AND THE PRINCIPAL WITNESS AGAINST THAT MAN HIS OWN WIFE DO YOU SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT I'LL HAVE MY DAUGHTER'S NAME DRAGGED THROUGH SUCH MIRE NO BY GOD I'LL BLOW THE DOG'S BRAINS OUT WITH MY OWN HAND FIRST
AS KATE AND HER STRANGE COMPANION PARTED THE FORMER INQUIRED WHY DID YOU ASK ME NOT TO SHOOT HIM YOU SURELY CANNOT LOVE HIM LOVE HIM SHE EXCLAIMED SOFTLY NO BUT I FEARED YOU WOULD KILL HIM
HE WAS A LITTLE MAN A TRIFLE OVER FIVE FEET HIGH AND SO FAT THAT ONE WONDERED HOW HE COULD GET ABOUT ALONE HIS CHIN AND NECK WERE A SERIES OF ROLLS OF FAT HIS FACE WAS ROUND LIKE A FULL MOON AND OUT OF IT
MISTER UNDERWOOD WENT BRIEFLY OVER THE TERMS WHICH HE HAD OUTLINED ON A SHEET OF PAPER BEFORE HIM ON HIS DESK WALCOTT SEATED EIGHT OR TEN FEET DISTANT LISTENED HIS DARK FACE PALING WITH ANGER
WE WERE MARRIED YEARS AGO BUT I DID NOT KNOW THE WOMAN WAS LIVING I SWEAR I DID NOT I SUPPOSED SHE WAS DEAD UNTIL THE DAY SHE CAME TO ME HOW ABOUT THE PAST YEAR YOU HAVE KNOWN ALL THIS TIME THAT SHE WAS LIVING
AND HE CHEERFULLY SUPPLIED THE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION HE HAD BEEN TO PALM BEACH AND HOT SPRINGS DURING THE WINTER AND TOLD ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN THERE HE WAS GOING TO NEWPORT IN THE SUMMER AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS THERE
NO DOUBT SAID THE OTHER BUT HE HASN'T ENOUGH MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF A GIRL LIKE ALICE
WATCHING JEALOUSLY AS HUNGRY DOGS DO FOR THE LEAST SUSPICIOUS SIGN TO SWOOP DOWN AND SHARE THE SPOIL
AND THE KOODOO TRYING TO REGAIN ITS FOOTING WAS TRIPPED BY THE CROSSED LEGS AND CAME DOWN WITH A CRASH AS IT FELL JOCK WAS ROUND AND FASTENED ON THE NOSE BUT IT WAS NO DUIKER IMPALA OR RIETBUCK THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS TIME
SHE WAS A BULL TERRIER WITH A DULL BRINDLED COAT BLACK AND GREY IN SHADOWY STRIPES SHE HAD SMALL CROSS LOOKING EYES AND UNCERTAIN ALWAYS MOVING EARS SHE WAS BAD TEMPERED AND MOST UNSOCIABLE BUT SHE WAS AS FAITHFUL AND AS BRAVE A DOG AS EVER LIVED
WAS NOT AT ALL A BAD ONE IT WAS AFTER THAT THAT THE NATURAL EFFECT OF SUCH A MEETING AND SUCH A CHANCE BEGAN TO TELL THINKING IT ALL OUT BEFOREHAND DOES NOT HELP MUCH FOR THINGS NEVER HAPPEN AS THEY ARE EXPECTED TO
AND BEYOND THEM THE ORDINARY SCATTERED THORNS AS I REACHED THIS POINT AND STOPPED TO LOOK OUT BETWEEN THE BUSHES ON TO THE MORE OPEN GROUND A KOODOO COW WALKED QUIETLY UP THE SLOPE FROM THE WATER
AND EVEN WITHOUT BEING RUN TO DEATH BY JOCK MUST HAVE DIED IN THE NIGHT OR HAVE LAIN DOWN AND BECOME TOO COLD AND STIFF TO MOVE IF NOT DISCOVERED BY WILD ANIMALS THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE OF FINDING IT UNTOUCHED IN THE EARLY MORNING
HE WOULD SPRING FORWARD AND STRIKE WITH THE SHARP CLOVEN FORE FOOT ZIP ZIP ZIP AT JOCK AS HE LANDED ANY ONE OF THE VICIOUS FLASHING STABS WOULD HAVE PINNED HIM TO THE EARTH AND FINISHED HIM BUT JOCK WAS NEVER THERE
EVIDENTLY THE KOODOO HAD BACKED AGAINST IT WHILST FACING JOCK AND HAD FALLEN OVER IT RENEWING THE FIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE WERE ALSO SOME GOLDEN HAIRS STICKING ON THE STUMPY END OF A BROKEN BRANCH WHICH MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH JOCK'S SCRAPED SIDES
AND THAT SHE WOULD FOLLOW PRESENTLY AFTER HE HAD DISAPPEARED SHE RAN BACK TO HER PATCH OF GRASS AND LAY DOWN BUT IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WAS BACK AGAIN SQUATTING IN THE ROAD LOOKING WITH THAT SAME ANXIOUS WORRIED EXPRESSION AFTER HER MASTER
THE KOODOO HAD FALLEN ON THE WOUNDED LEG AND FAILED TO RISE WITH THE FIRST EFFORT JOCK WHILE STILL SLITHERING ALONG THE GROUND ON HIS BACK WAS TEARING AT THE AIR WITH HIS FEET IN HIS MAD HASTE TO GET BACK TO THE ATTACK AND AS HE SCRAMBLED UP
FIFTY YARDS AWAY AMONG SOME BUSHES JOCK FOUND THE HEAD AND STILL FURTHER AFIELD WERE REMAINS OF SKIN AND THIGH BONES CRUSHED ALMOST BEYOND RECOGNITION NO AASVOGEL HAD DONE THIS IT WAS HYENAS WORK
AND THIS WAS ALMOST SURE TO HAPPEN WHEN THE CARBINE BECAME HOT FROM QUICK FIRING IT JAMMED NOW AND FEARING TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE CHASE I DARED NOT STOP A SECOND BUT RAN ON STRUGGLING FROM TIME TO TIME TO WRENCH THE BREACH OPEN REACHING THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD DISAPPEARED
AND RETURN IN HALF AN HOUR TO FIND NOTHING BUT A FEW BONES THE HORNS AND HOOFS A RAG OF SKIN AND A GROUP OF DISGUSTING GORGED VULTURES SQUATTING ON A PATCH OF GROUND ALL SMEARED TORN AND FEATHER STREWN FROM THEIR VORACIOUS STRUGGLES
JOCK MADE HIS DISCOVERY WHILE FOLLOWING A RIETBUCK WHICH I HAD WOUNDED IN THIS WAY HE HAD MADE SEVERAL TRIES AT ITS NOSE AND THROAT BUT THE BUCK WAS GOING TOO STRONGLY AND WAS OUT OF REACH MOREOVER IT WOULD NOT STOP OR TURN WHEN HE HEADED IT BUT CHARGED STRAIGHT ON
WENT ON WITH HIM INTENDING TO REJOIN US AT THE NEXT OUTSPAN AS HE JUMPED ON TO THE PASSING WAGGON HE CALLED TO JESS AND SHE RAN OUT OF A PATCH OF SOFT GRASS UNDER ONE OF THE BIG TREES BEHIND OUR WAGGONS SHE ANSWERED HIS CALL INSTANTLY
THE SHOT ONLY MADDENED HER AND SHE CHARGED BUT THE TWO DOGS DASHED AT HER ONE AT EACH SIDE BARKING SNAPPING AND YELLING RUSHING IN AND JUMPING BACK SO FAST AND FURIOUSLY THAT THEY FLUSTERED HER LEAVING THE MAN FOR THE MOMENT SHE TURNED ON THEM
FOR A LITTLE WAY THE PACE SEEMED AS GREAT AS EVER BUT IT SOON DIED AWAY THE DRIVING POWER WAS GONE THE STRAIN AND WEIGHT ON THE ONE SOUND LEG AND THE TRIPPING OF THE BROKEN ONE WERE TELLING AND FROM THAT ON I WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE IT ALL
BUT THERE WAS NO SPOOR OF KOODOO OR OF JOCK TO BE SEEN THERE ONLY PRINTS INNUMERABLE OF WILD DOGS HYENAS AND JACKALS AND SOME TRACES OF WHERE THE CARCASE NO DOUBT ALREADY HALF EATEN HAD BEEN DRAGGED BY THEM IN THE EFFORT TO TEAR IT ASUNDER
THEN WITH A SNORT OF FURY THE KOODOO HALF RISING GAVE ITS HEAD A WILD UPWARD SWEEP AND SHOOK AS A SPRINGING ROD FLINGS A FISH THE KOODOO FLUNG JOCK OVER ITS HEAD AND ON TO A LOW FLAT TOPPED THORN TREE BEHIND
AND THESE ARE THE DRINKING PLACES OF THE GAME
IN THE FIRST RUSH THE KOODOO SEEMED TO DASH RIGHT OVER JOCK THE SWIRL OF DUST AND LEAVES AND THE BULK OF THE KOODOO HIDING HIM THEN I SAW HIM CLOSE ABREAST LOOKING UP AT IT AND MAKING FURIOUS JUMPS FOR ITS NOSE ALTERNATELY FROM ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER
IT WAS A RUNNING FIGHT FROM THAT ON THE INSTANT THE KOODOO TURNED TO GO JOCK WAS ON TO THE LEG AGAIN AND NOTHING COULD SHAKE HIS HOLD I HAD TO KEEP AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE FOR THE BULL WAS STILL GOOD FOR A FURIOUS CHARGE EVEN WITH JOCK HANGING ON
BUT WHEN SHE SAW HIM MOVING OFF ON THE OTHER WAGGON SHE SAT DOWN IN THE ROAD AND WATCHED HIM ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME SECONDS THEN RAN ON A FEW STEPS IN HER CURIOUS QUICK SILENT WAY AND AGAIN STOPPED GIVING SWIFT GLANCES ALTERNATELY TOWARDS TED AND TOWARDS US
WHILE I WAS EXAMINING IT HE PICKED UP THE TRAIL AND TROTTED ON WE CAME UPON FOUR OR FIVE OTHER RINGS WHERE THEY HAD FOUGHT THE LAST OF THESE WAS CURIOUSLY DIVIDED BY A FALLEN TREE
ONCE MORE I KNELT GRIPPING HARD AND HOLDING MY BREATH TO SNATCH A MOMENT'S STEADINESS AND FIRED BUT I MISSED AGAIN
EVERY ONE WHO IS GOOD AT ANYTHING HAS SOME FAVOURITE METHOD OR DEVICE OF HIS OWN THAT WAS JOCK'S IT MAY HAVE COME TO HIM AS IT COMES TO MANY BY ACCIDENT BUT HAVING ONCE GOT IT HE PERFECTED IT AND USED IT WHENEVER IT WAS POSSIBLE
MAYBE TOO HE WAS BLAZING WITH ANGER AND CONTEMPT FOR THIS PERSISTENT LITTLE GAD FLY THAT WORRIED HIM SO AND KEPT OUT OF REACH SOMETIMES HE SNORTED AND FEINTED TO CHARGE AT OTHER TIMES BACKED SLOWLY GIVING WAY TO DRAW THE ENEMY ON
AND IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE FOR BONE AND MUSCLE TO STAND THE TWO OR THREE TERRIBLE WRENCHES THAT I SAW THE SHOT WAS THE END AND AS THE SPLENDID HEAD DROPPED SLOWLY OVER JOCK LET GO HIS HOLD
AND WHEN WE PASSED THROUGH THEIR KNOWN HAUNTS CHANCES OF SMALLER GAME WERE OFTEN NEGLECTED IN THE HOPE OF COMING ACROSS THE KOODOO I COULD NOT GIVE UP WHOLE DAYS TO HUNTING FOR WE HAD TO KEEP MOVING ALONG WITH THE WAGGONS ALL THE TIME
THE BULL TRIED TO CHOP HIM WITH ITS FORE FEET BUT COULD NOT RAISE ITSELF ENOUGH AND AT EACH PAUSE JOCK WITH HIS WATCHFUL LITTLE EYES EVER ON THE ALERT DODGED HIS BODY ROUND TO AVOID THE CHOPPING FEET WITHOUT LETTING GO HIS HOLD
AND RUNNING AHEAD OF THE KOODOO I MADE FOR THESE HOPING TO FIND A STICK STRAIGHT ENOUGH FOR A RAMROD TO FORCE THE EMPTY CARTRIDGE OUT
OUTSIDE THIS THE GRASS WAS ALSO FLATTENED AND THERE I FOUND A DOG'S FOOTPRINTS
I COULD NOT HEAR THE NAME OR SEE THE SPOOR OF KOODOO WITHOUT A PANG OF REGRET AND THE THOUGHT THAT NEVER AGAIN WOULD SUCH A CHANCE OCCUR KOODOO LIKE OTHER KINDS OF GAME WERE NOT TO BE FOUND EVERYWHERE THEY FAVOURED SOME LOCALITIES MORE THAN OTHERS
THE ONE I HAD SEEN AND SHOT WAS BUT ONE OF A HERD ALL DOZING PEACEFULLY IN THE SHADE AND STRANGEST OF ALL IT WAS THE ONE THAT WAS FARTHEST FROM ME TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THIS ONE AT DISTANCES FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY YARDS FROM ME
AND THEN WITHOUT GIVING ME A CHANCE HE WAS OFF INTO THE BUSH IN A FEW FRISKY SKIPS I FOLLOWED QUIETLY KNOWING THAT AS HE WAS ON THE FEED AND NOT SCARED HE WOULD NOT GO FAR
WHICH SHE APPEARED BEFORE WE GOT INTO POSITION SO DEMORALISED THE KAFFIRS THAT THEY BOLTED AND WE GAVE IT UP OWNING OURSELVES BEATEN
ONCE MORE LIKE A FLASH JOCK WAS OVER THE FALLEN BODY AND HAD FASTENED ON THE NOSE BUT ONLY TO BE SHAKEN WORSE THAN BEFORE THE KOODOO LITERALLY FLOGGED THE GROUND WITH HIM AND FOR AN INSTANT I SHUT MY EYES IT SEEMED AS IF THE PLUCKY DOG WOULD BE BEATEN INTO PULP
I HOOKED THE LEVER ON TO A BRANCH AND SETTING MY FOOT AGAINST THE TREE WRENCHED UNTIL THE EMPTY CARTRIDGE FLEW OUT AND I WENT STAGGERING BACKWARDS IN THE LAST STRUGGLE WHILE I WAS BUSY WITH THE RIFLE THE KOODOO HAD MOVED AND IT WAS THEN LYING AGAINST ONE OF THE FALLEN TRUNKS
THE DOG SOMERSAULTED SLOWLY AS HE CIRCLED IN THE AIR DROPPED ON HIS BACK IN THE THORNS SOME TWELVE FEET FROM THE GROUND AND CAME TUMBLING DOWN THROUGH THE BRANCHES SURELY THE TREE SAVED HIM FOR IT SEEMED AS IF SUCH A THROW MUST BREAK HIS BACK
AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN ROUGHLY GRAVELLED THERE HE SEEMED A LITTLE STIFF AND FLINCHED WHEN I PRESSED HIS SIDES AND MUSCLES BUT HE WAS AS GAME AS EVER WHEN HE SAW THE RIFLE TAKEN DOWN THE KOODOO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BODY
BUT UNTIL HE DROPPED WITH A THUD AND TEARING AND SCRAMBLING TO HIS FEET HE RACED IN AGAIN I FELT CERTAIN HE HAD BEEN GORED THROUGH THE KOODOO WAS UP AGAIN THEN I HAD RUSHED IN WITH RIFLE CLUBBED WITH THE WILD IDEA OF STUNNING IT BEFORE IT COULD RISE
OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY ENOUGH IN MANY PARTS TO LOCATE THE KOODOO AND MAKE SURE OF GETTING A GOOD BAG AS IT WAS ON THREE OR FOUR OCCASIONS WE DID COME ACROSS THEM AND ONCE I GOT A RUNNING SHOT BUT MISSED THIS WAS NOT NEEDED TO KEEP MY INTEREST IN THEM ALIVE
STOPPING HIMSELF WITH ALL FOUR FEET SPREAD JUST OUT OF REACH THEN LIKE A RED STREAK HE WOULD FLY THROUGH THE AIR WITH A SNAP FOR THE KOODOO'S NOSE IT WAS A FIGHT FOR LIFE AND A GRAND SIGHT FOR THE KOODOO IN SPITE OF HIS WOUND EASILY HELD HIS OWN
JOCK HAD LEARNED ONE VERY CLEVER TRICK IN PULLING DOWN WOUNDED ANIMALS
THE KOODOO GAVE A SNORT OF INDIGNATION AND SHOOK ITS HEAD AS A TERRIER SHAKES A RAT SO IT SHOOK JOCK WHIPPING THE GROUND WITH HIS SWINGING BODY AND WITH ANOTHER INDIGNANT SNORT AND TOSS OF THE HEAD FLUNG HIM OFF SENDING HIM SKIDDING ALONG THE GROUND ON HIS BACK
HER EARS WERE LAID FLAT BACK HER LIPS TWITCHING CONSTANTLY SHOWING THE STRONG WHITE TEETH AND HER CROSS WICKED EYES HAD SUCH A LOOK OF REMORSELESS CRUELTY IN THEM THAT WE STOPPED AS IF WE HAD BEEN TURNED TO STONE
BUT THE BROKEN LEG SWAYED OVER ONE OF THE BRANCHES AND JOCK WITH FEET PLANTED AGAINST THE TREE HUNG ON AND THE KOODOO TURNING FURIOUSLY ON HIM STUMBLED FLOUNDERED TRIPPED AND CAME DOWN WITH A CRASH AMONGST THE CRACKLING WOOD
NO ONE COULD DO ANYTHING WITH HER NO ONE COULD GET NEAR THE GUNS OR THE WATER BARREL AS SOON AS WE RETURNED FOR A FRESH ATTEMPT SHE REAPPEARED IN THE SAME PLACE AND IN THE SAME WAY THE POSITION WAS TOO RIDICULOUS AND WE WERE AT OUR WITS END
AND NOTING HER TUCKED UP APPEARANCE AND SHORTENED STRIDES SET JOCK ON HER TRAIL BELIEVING THAT SHE WOULD BE DOWN IN A FEW MINUTES IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GO OVER IT ALL AGAIN IT WAS MUCH THE SAME AS THE IMPALA CHASE
A BROKEN LEG SHOWS AT ONCE BUT A BODY SHOT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PLACE AND ANIMALS SHOT THROUGH THE LUNGS AND EVEN THROUGH THE LOWER PART OF THE HEART OFTEN GO AWAY AT A CRACKING PACE AND ARE OUT OF SIGHT IN NO TIME PERHAPS TO KEEP IT UP FOR MILES
UNDER A BIG TREE ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE STREAM IT WAS THE TREE UNDER WHICH SOLTKE PRAYED AND DIED ABOUT SUNDOWN JUST BEFORE WE WERE READY TO START SOME OTHER WAGGONS PASSED AND TED KNOWING THE OWNER
BUT AT THE THIRD OR FOURTH ATTEMPT HE GOT IT AND HUNG ON AND WITH ALL FOURS SPREAD HE DRAGGED ALONG THE GROUND THE FIRST STARTLED SPRING OF THE KOODOO JERKED HIM INTO THE AIR BUT THERE WAS NO LET GO NOW
I LEFT THE SCENE OF TORN CARCASE AND CRUNCHED BONES CONSUMED BY REGRETS AND DISAPPOINTMENT EACH FRESH DETAIL ONLY ADDED TO MY FEELING OF DISGUST BUT JOCK DID NOT SEEM TO MIND
JESS MET HIM OUT ON THE ROAD IN THE DARK WHERE SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING HALF THE TIME EVER SINCE HE LEFT
I TRIED STICK AFTER STICK FOR A RAMROD BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS AT LAST IN DESPERATION AT SEEING JOCK ONCE MORE HANGING TO THE KOODOO'S NOSE
WHEN A MOVEMENT ON A HIGHER LEVEL CAUGHT MY EYE IT WAS JUST THE FLIP OF A FLY TICKLED EAR BUT IT WAS A MOVEMENT WHERE ALL ELSE WAS STILL AND INSTANTLY THE FORM OF A KOODOO COW APPEARED BEFORE ME AS A PICTURE IS THROWN ON A SCREEN BY A MAGIC LANTERN
AS THEY RACED ALONG TOGETHER THE KOODOO HOLDING ITS NOSE HIGH AND WELL FORWARD AS THEY DO WHEN ON THE MOVE WITH THE HORNS THROWN BACK ALMOST HORIZONTALLY WAS OUT OF HIS REACH AND GALLOPED HEAVILY ON COMPLETELY IGNORING HIS ATTACKS
SHE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OR SKILL AND WAS ONLY FIERCE AND BRAVE AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT SHE WOULD BE KILLED SHE WOULD LISTEN TO TED BUT TO NO ONE ELSE ONE OF US MIGHT HAVE SHOUTED HIS LUNGS OUT
THEN FOR A MATTER OF A HUNDRED YARDS OR MORE IT LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD FOUGHT AND TUMBLED ALL THE WAY JOCK WAS SOME DISTANCE AHEAD OF ME TROTTING ALONG QUIETLY WHEN I SAW HIM LOOK UP GIVE THAT RARE GROWLING BARK OF HIS ONE OF SUPPRESSED BUT REAL FURY
AND THRUSTING HIS FEET WELL OUT SIMPLY DRAGGED UNTIL THE BUCK SLOWED DOWN AND THEN BEGAN FURIOUSLY TUGGING SIDEWAYS THE CROSSING OF THE LEGS BROUGHT THE WOUNDED ANIMAL DOWN IMMEDIATELY
BUT EVEN SMALL DOGS ARE USEFUL AND MANY A FINE FEAT STANDS TO THE CREDIT OF LITTLE TERRIERS IN GUARDING CAMPS AT NIGHT AND IN STANDING OFF WOUNDED ANIMALS THAT MEANT MISCHIEF DENNISON WAS SAVED FROM A WOUNDED LIONESS BY HIS TWO FOX TERRIERS
SO THEY TURNED THIS WAY AND THAT UNTIL A WILDER PLUNGE SWUNG JOCK OFF HIS FEET THROWING THE BROKEN LEG ACROSS THE OTHER ONE THEN WITH FEET FIRMLY PLANTED JOCK TUGGED AGAIN
BUCK OF MANY KINDS HAD FALLEN TO US BUT SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED THERE WAS ONE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT WAS NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN THE PICTURE OF THAT KOODOO BULL AS HE APPEARED FOR THE LAST TIME LOOKING OVER THE ANT HEAP THE DAY WE WERE LOST WAS ALWAYS BEFORE ME
LOOKING ABOUT WITH BIG ANGRY BUT UNFRIGHTENED EYES FOR THE HERD HIS HERD THAT HAD DESERTED HIM OR WITH A SLIGHT TOSS OF HIS HEAD HE WOULD WALK LIMPINGLY FORWARD FORCING THE IGNORED JOCK BEFORE HIM
THE FIRST SWING TO GET RID OF JOCK HAD LITERALLY SLOGGED HIM AGAINST THE TREE THE SECOND SWING SWEPT HIM UNDER IT WHERE A BEND IN THE TRUNK RAISED IT ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND
AND BOTH IN BARREL AND BREECH IT WAS WELL PITTED WITH RUST SCARS ONE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT IT WAS ALWAYS JAMMING AND UNLESS THE CARTRIDGES WERE KEPT WELL GREASED THE EMPTY SHELLS WOULD STICK AND THE EJECTOR FAIL TO WORK
AND WITH HIS LARGE BUT SHAPELY AND MOST SENSITIVE EARS THROWN FORWARD EXAMINED US FRANKLY WHILE HE MOVED SLIGHTLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO AS TO KEEP UNDER COVER OF THE OXEN AND BUSILY CONTINUE HIS BROWSING
HE HAD GONE OUT TO SHOOT BUSH PHEASANTS AND CAME UNEXPECTEDLY ON A LIONESS PLAYING WITH HER CUBS THE CUBS HID IN THE GRASS BUT SHE STOOD UP AT BAY TO PROTECT THEM AND HE FORGETTING THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE BIG LOOPER CARTRIDGES FROM HIS GUN AND RELOADED WITH NUMBER SIX FIRED
FOR HE WAS ONLY ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF JOCK
THE MAGNIFICENT CREATURES HAD BEEN STANDING AND I HAD NOT SEEN THEM IT WAS THE FLICKER OF THIS ONE'S EAR ALONE THAT HAD CAUGHT MY EYE
I SAW WITH INTENSE RELIEF AND EXCITEMENT JOCK AND THE KOODOO HAVING IT OUT LESS THAN A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY THE KOODOO'S LEG WAS BROKEN RIGHT UP IN THE HAM AND IT WAS A TERRIBLE HANDICAP FOR AN ANIMAL SO BIG AND HEAVY BUT HIS NIMBLENESS AND QUICKNESS WERE ASTONISHING
YET THE WRENCHES IT GAVE TO FREE ITSELF DREW THE NOSE AND UPPER LIP OUT LIKE TOUGH RUBBER AND SEEMED TO STRETCH JOCK'S NECK VISIBLY I HAD TO COME ROUND WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THEM TO AVOID RISK OF HITTING JOCK
A MILE OR SO ON WE CHECKED AGAIN WHERE THE GRASS WAS TRAMPLED AND THE GROUND SCORED WITH SPOOR
YOU MUST NOT FEED ANOTHER MAN'S DOG A DOG HAS ONLY ONE MASTER WE RESPECTED JESS GREATLY BUT NO ONE KNEW QUITE HOW MUCH WE RESPECTED HER UNTIL THE MEMORABLE DAY NEAR SHIP MOUNTAIN WE HAD RESTED THROUGH THE HEAT OF THE DAY
AND THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO PULL IT DOWN OR BAY IT
FORGETTING THE LAST NIGHT'S EXPERIENCE FORGETTING EVERYTHING EXCEPT HOW WE HAD TWICE CHASED AND TWICE LOST THEM SEEING ONLY ANOTHER AND THE GRANDEST PRIZE SLIPPING AWAY
AND THERE RUNNING HARD AND DROPPING QUICKLY TO MY KNEE FOR STEADIER AIM I FIRED AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT EACH TIME A LONGER SHOT AND MORE OBSCURED BY THE INTERVENING BUSH AND NO TELL TALE THUD CAME BACK TO CHEER ME ON
FOR A MINUTE WE STOOD OUR GROUND AND THEN THE HAIR ON HER BACK AND SHOULDERS BEGAN VERY SLOWLY TO STAND UP THAT WAS ENOUGH WE CLEARED OFF IT WAS A MIGHTY UNCANNY APPEARANCE THEN ANOTHER TRIED HIS HAND BUT IT WAS JUST THE SAME
I DECIDED TO STAY ON WHERE WE WERE UNTIL THE NEXT EVENING AND TO HAVE ANOTHER TRY FOR THE WOUNDED KOODOO WITH THE CHANCE OF COMING ACROSS THE TROOP AGAIN BY DAYBREAK
A LOT OF QUALITIES ARE NEEDED IN THE MAKE UP OF A GOOD HUNTING DOG SIZE STRENGTH QUICKNESS SCENT SENSE AND SPEED AND PLENTY OF COURAGE THEY ARE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO GET
ONCE MORE THE KOODOO CAME IN SIGHT JUST A CHANCE AT FOUR HUNDRED YARDS AS HE REACHED AN OPEN SPACE ON RISING GROUND
AND YOU MAY SEE TINY SPECKS WHERE NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BEFORE TAKE YOUR FIELD GLASSES THE SPECKS ARE VULTURES CIRCLING UP ON HIGH LOOK AGAIN AND FAR FAR ABOVE YOU
HE WENT AHEAD SOBERLY AND STEADILY AND ONCE WHEN HE STOPPED COMPLETELY TO SNIFF AT A PARTICULAR TUFT OF GRASS I FOUND OUT WHAT WAS HELPING HIM THE GRASS WAS WELL STREAKED WITH BLOOD QUITE DRY IT IS TRUE STILL IT WAS BLOOD
THE GREAT CHARM OF BUSHVELD HUNTING IS ITS VARIETY YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL TURN UP NEXT THE ONLY CERTAINTY BEING THAT IT WILL NOT BE WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTING
LOWER HIS HEAD AND CHARGE THEN CAME HEAVY FLAPPING AND SCRAMBLING AND THE WIND OF HUGE WINGS AS TWENTY OR THIRTY GREAT LUMBERING AASVOGELS FLOPPED ALONG THE GROUND WITH JOCK DASHING FURIOUSLY ABOUT AMONG THEM
BEFORE THE WILDNESS OF PANIC HAD STRICKEN THEM THE PICTURE SEEMS PHOTOGRAPHED ON EYE AND BRAIN NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN A WHIRLWIND OF DUST AND LEAVES MARKED HIS COURSE AND THROUGH IT I FIRED UNSTEADIED BY EXCITEMENT AND HARDLY ABLE TO SEE
ALL EXCEPT THE WOUNDED ONE WHICH HAD TURNED OFF FROM THE OTHERS
AND IF SO WAS HE FOLLOWING THE SCENT OF THE OLD CHASE OR MERELY WHAT HE MIGHT REMEMBER OF THE WAY HE HAD GONE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT SCENT COULD LIE IN THAT DRY COUNTRY FOR TWELVE HOURS YET IT WAS CLEARLY NOSE MORE THAN EYES THAT GUIDED HIM
FOR JESS HELD THE CAMP THE KAFFIRS DECLARED THE DOG WAS MAD AND WE BEGAN TO HAVE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SUSPICIONS THAT THEY WERE RIGHT BUT WE DECIDED TO MAKE A LAST ATTEMPT AND SURROUNDING THE PLACE APPROACHED FROM ALL SIDES BUT THE SUDDENNESS WITH
SOMETIMES SWINGING IN THE AIR AND SOMETIMES SLIDING ON HIS BACK HE PULLED FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO THROW THE BIG ANIMAL INEFFECTUAL AND EVEN HOPELESS AS IT LOOKED AT FIRST JOCK'S ATTACKS SOON BEGAN TO TELL
BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE STOPPED HER FROM GIVING CHASE THE MOMENT SHE SAW ANYTHING AND KEEPING ON TILL SHE WAS TOO DEAD BEAT TO MOVE ANY FURTHER THE FIRST TIME I SAW JESS WE WERE HAVING DINNER AND I GAVE HER A BONE PUTTING IT DOWN CLOSE TO HER AND SAYING HERE GOOD DOG
AND GAINING HIS FOOTHOLD THERE JOCK STOOD FAST THERE THERE WITH HIS FEET PLANTED FIRMLY AND HIS SHOULDER HUMPED AGAINST THE DEAD TREE HE STOOD THIS TUG OF WAR THE KOODOO WITH ITS HEAD TWISTED BACK AS CAUGHT AT THE END OF THE SWING COULD PUT NO WEIGHT TO THE PULL
USING THE SOUND HIND LEG AS A PIVOT HE SWUNG ROUND ALWAYS FACING HIS ENEMY
AND THUS DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE MAN IN THIS CASE THE BONNY LITTLE RED BROWN FELLOW WAS NOT A BIT SCARED HE MAINTAINED HIS PRESENCE OF MIND ADMIRABLY FROM TIME TO TIME HE TURNED HIS HEAD OUR WAY
KNOWING HOW JESS HATED KAFFIRS WE LAUGHED AT THE NOTION AND WENT FOR THE THINGS OURSELVES AS WE CAME WITHIN FIVE YARDS OF THE TREE WHERE WE HAD LEFT THE GUNS THERE WAS A RUSTLE IN THE GRASS AND JESS CAME OUT WITH HER SWIFT SILENT RUN
HE JUMPED OUT BRISKLY AS SOON AS I STARTED WALKING IN EARNEST AS THOUGH HE RECOGNISED THAT WE WERE MAKING A FRESH START AND HE BEGAN TO LOOK FORWARD IMMEDIATELY THE LITTLE BARE FLAT WHERE THE KOODOO HAD FALLEN FOR THE LAST TIME
AND FROM THAT ON HE LED THE WAY IT WAS MUCH SLOWER WORK THEN AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED THERE WAS NOTHING TO GUIDE ME AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS AFTER
IN THE EARLY MORNING FROM THEIR WHITE SPLASHED EERIES ON SOME DISTANT MOUNTAIN THEY SLIDE OFF LIKE A LAUNCHING SHIP INTO THEIR SEA OF BLUE AND STRIKING THE CURRENTS OF THE UPPER AIR SWEEP ROUND AND UPWARDS IN IMMENSE CIRCLES
WILL OFTEN TAKE NO NOTICE OF NATIVES ALLOWING THEM TO APPROACH TO VERY CLOSE QUARTERS
THERE IS A SUGGESTION OF GRACE AND POISE IN THE MOVEMENT OF THE KOODOO BULL'S HEAD AS HE GALLOPS THROUGH THE BUSH WHICH IS ONE OF HIS DISTINCTIONS ABOVE THE OTHER ANTELOPES
PARTLY BECAUSE YOU KNEW SHE WOULD NOT STAND ANY NONSENSE NO PUSHING PATTING OR PUNISHMENT AND VERY LITTLE TALKING TO AND PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FAITHFUL AND PLUCKY SHE WAS NOT A HUNTING DOG BUT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HAD HELPED TO PULL DOWN WOUNDED GAME
NO DOUBT HE HAD FOUGHT OUT MANY A LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE TO WIN AND HOLD HIS PLACE AS LORD OF THE HERD AND KNEW EVERY TRICK OF ATTACK AND DEFENCE
AND EYED ME IN THE MOST UNPROMISING FASHION WHENEVER I ATTEMPTED TO HEAD IT OFF OR EVEN TO COME CLOSE UP THE BIG EYES WERE BLOOD SHOT THEN BUT THERE WAS NO LOOK OF FEAR IN THEM THEY BLAZED WITH BAFFLED RAGE
MOVING ALONG SILENTLY UNDER GOOD COVER I REACHED A THICK SCRUBBY BUSH AND PEERED OVER THE TOP OF IT TO SEARCH THE GRASS UNDER THE SURROUNDING THORN TREES FOR THE LITTLE RED BROWN FORM I WAS LOOKING ABOUT LOW DOWN IN THE RUSSETY GRASS
WHEN I COULD AFFORD A HORSE AND COULD KEEP PACE WITH HIM
AS IT WAS HE DROPPED WITH A SICKENING THUMP YET EVEN AS HE FELL I SAW AGAIN THE SCRAMBLING TEARING MOVEMENT AS IF HE WAS TRYING TO RACE BACK TO THE FIGHT EVEN BEFORE HE REACHED GROUND
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY IN WORDS ANY REAL IDEA OF THE SCENE AND HOW THINGS HAPPENED OF COURSE IT WAS ONLY FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND THAT WE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
THINGS LOOKED VERY BLACK INDEED I HEARD HIS PANTING BREATH BEFORE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SEE ANYTHING IT WAS PAST ONE O'CLOCK WHEN HE RETURNED AS WE HAD MISSED THE NIGHT TREK TO WAIT FOR JOCK
THE OXEN WERE INSPANNED AND THE LAST ODD THINGS WERE BEING PUT UP WHEN ONE OF THE BOYS CAME TO SAY THAT HE COULD NOT GET THE GUNS AND WATER BARREL BECAUSE JESS WOULD NOT LET HIM NEAR THEM THERE WAS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH THE DOG HE SAID HE THOUGHT SHE WAS MAD
INDEED ALMOST AS THOUGH IT WERE BEARING THE BODY BELOW AT THE FOURTH OR FIFTH ATTEMPT BY JOCK A SPURT FROM THE KOODOO BROUGHT HIM CANNONING AGAINST ITS SHOULDER AND HE WAS SENT ROLLING UNNOTICED YARDS AWAY HE SCRAMBLED INSTANTLY TO HIS FEET
THE HIGH SHOULDERED SLINKING BRUTE WITH JAWS LIKE A STONE CRUSHER ALONE CRACKS BONES LIKE THOSE AND BIGGER ONES WHICH EVEN THE LION CANNOT TACKLE I WALKED BACK A LITTLE WAY AND FOUND THE SCENE OF THE LAST STAND ALL HARROWED BARE
I LOOKED AT HIM THE MANE ON HIS NECK AND SHOULDERS WHICH HAD RISEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE VULTURES WAS NOT FLAT YET HE WAS SNIFFING ABOUT SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY ON THE SPOOR OF THE HYENAS AND WILD DOGS AND HE LOOKED FIGHT ALL OVER
APPEARING AS UNEXPECTEDLY AS A SNAKE DOES AND WITH SOME ODD SUGGESTION OF A SNAKE IN HER LOOK AND ATTITUDE HER HEAD BODY AND TAIL WERE IN A DEAD LINE AND SHE WAS CROUCHING SLIGHTLY AS FOR A SPRING
THE SAME SUPPLE BALANCING MOVEMENT THAT ONE NOTES IN THE NATIVE GIRLS BEARING THEIR CALABASHES OF WATER UPON THEIR HEADS IS SEEN IN THE NECK OF THE KOODOO AND FOR THE SAME REASON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY ARE SOFTENED INTO MERE UNDULATIONS
THE THUD OF THE BULLET AND THE TREMENDOUS BOUND OF THE KOODOO STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR TOLD THAT THE SHOT HAD GONE HOME BUT THESE THINGS WERE FOR A TIME FORGOTTEN IN THE SURPRISE THAT FOLLOWED AT THE SOUND OF THE SHOT TWENTY OTHER KOODOO JUMPED INTO LIFE AND SIGHT BEFORE ME
DASHING OUT FROM THE SCRUB REACHED HIS HEELS THE OLD MARTINI CARBINE HAD ONE BAD FAULT EVEN I COULD NOT DENY THAT YEARS OF ROUGH AND CARELESS TREATMENT IN ALL SORTS OF WEATHER FOR IT WAS ONLY A DISCARDED OLD MOUNTED POLICE WEAPON HAD TOLD ON IT
ONLY ONCE HE MADE A MISTAKE AND HE PAID FOR IT VERY NEARLY WITH HIS LIFE HE HAD ALREADY USED THIS DEVICE SUCCESSFULLY SEVERAL TIMES BUT SO FAR ONLY WITH THE SMALLER BUCK
HE WAS TOO MAD TO BE WARY
BOUNDING OVER HIM IN TRYING ONCE MORE FOR THE THROAT HE CANNONED AGAINST THE BUCK'S SHOULDER AND WAS SENT ROLLING YARDS AWAY THIS SEEMED TO MADDEN HIM RACING UP BEHIND HE FLEW AT THE DANGLING LEG CAUGHT IT AT THE SHIN
BUT BEFORE THERE WAS TIME TO RAISE THE RIFLE HER EASY STRIDE HAD CARRIED HER BEHIND A SMALL MIMOSA TREE I TOOK ONE QUICK STEP OUT TO FOLLOW HER UP AND FOUND MYSELF FACE TO FACE AT LESS THAN A DOZEN YARDS WITH A GRAND KOODOO BULL
DABBING VICIOUSLY WITH HER HUGE PAWS FIRST AT ONE THEN AT THE OTHER QUICK AS LIGHTNING SHE STRUCK RIGHT AND LEFT AS A KITTEN WILL AT A TWIRLED STRING BUT THEY KEPT OUT OF REACH
AND FOR AUGHT YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE OTHERS STILL BEYOND HOW HIGH ARE THEY AND WHAT CAN THEY SEE FROM THERE WHO KNOWS BUT THIS IS SURE THAT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES SCORES WILL COME SWOOPING DOWN IN GREAT SPIRAL RUSHES WHERE NOT ONE WAS VISIBLE BEFORE
BUT FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN BEHIND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THIS FACT THAT INSPIRED THE NEXT ATTEMPT OR PERHAPS HE REALISED THAT ATTACK IN FRONT WAS USELESS FOR THIS TIME HE WENT DETERMINEDLY FOR THE BROKEN LEG IT SWUNG ABOUT IN WILD ECCENTRIC CURVES
BUZZING FLY TORMENTS ONE ON A HOT DAY AND INDEED TO THE KOODOO JUST THEN HE WAS THE FLY AND NOTHING MORE HE COULD ONLY ANNOY HIS BIG ENEMY AND WAS PLAYING WITH HIS LIFE TO DO IT SOMETIMES HE TRIED TO GET ROUND SOMETIMES PRETENDED TO CHARGE STRAIGHT IN
DRY IN WINTER BUT FULL CHARGED WITH MUDDY FLOOD IN SUMMER WHICH DRAIN THE BUSHVELD TO ITS RIVERS HERE AND THERE WHERE AN IMPERMEABLE ROCK FORMATION CROSSES THESE CHANNELS THERE ARE DEEP POOLS WHICH EXCEPT IN YEARS OF DROUGHT LAST ALL THROUGH THE WINTER
THEN THE RIGHT HIND LEG SWUNG OUT AND THE GREAT CREATURE SANK FOR A MOMENT ALMOST TO THE GROUND AND THE SENSE OF TRIUMPH THE LONGED FOR AND UNEXPECTED SUCCESS WENT TO MY HEAD LIKE A RUSH OF BLOOD THERE HAD BEEN NO TIME TO AIM AND THE SHOT A REAL SNAP SHOT
ONE BLACK POINT SEEMED TO PIERCE HIM THROUGH AND THROUGH SHOWING A FOOT OUT THE OTHER SIDE AND A JERKY TWIST OF THE GREAT HEAD SENT HIM TWIRLING LIKE A TIP CAT EIGHT OR TEN FEET UP IN THE AIR
AND HIS JAWS SNAPPING LIKE RAT TRAPS AS HE MISSED THEM ON A LITTLE OPEN FLAT OF HARD BAKED SAND LAY THE STRIPPED FRAME OF THE KOODOO THE HEAD AND LEG BONES WERE MISSING MEAT STRIPPED FRAGMENTS WERE SCATTERED ALL ABOUT
SHE GAVE A LOW GROWL AND HER LITTLE EYES TURNED ON ME FOR JUST ONE LOOK AS SHE GOT UP AND WALKED AWAY THERE WAS A SNIGGER OF LAUGHTER FROM SOME OF THE OTHERS BUT NOBODY SAID ANYTHING AND IT SEEMED WISER TO ASK NO QUESTIONS JUST THEN
THEIR HUGE MOTIONLESS WINGS CARRYING THEM HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL THEY ARE LOST TO HUMAN SIGHT LIE ON YOUR BACK IN SOME DENSE SHADE WHERE NO SIDE LIGHTS STRIKE IN BUT WHERE AN OPENING ABOVE FORMS A SORT OF NATURAL TELESCOPE TO THE SKY
SHE NEVER BARKED NEVER HOWLED WHEN BEATEN FOR BITING STRANGERS OR KAFFIRS OR GOING FOR THE CATTLE SHE WAS VERY SILENT VERY SAVAGE AND VERY QUICK SHE BELONGED TO MY FRIEND TED AND NEVER LEFT HIS SIDE DAY OR NIGHT HER NAME WAS JESS
EVEN UNBORN PUPPIES HAD JEALOUS PROSPECTIVE OWNERS WAITING TO CLAIM THEM THERE IS ALWAYS PLENTY OF ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GOOD HUNTING DOGS WERE AS RARE AS GOOD MEN GOOD HORSES AND GOOD FRONT OXEN
IMPOSSIBLE AS IT SEEMED TO SHAKE JOCK OFF OR TO GET AWAY FROM US AND IN SPITE OF THE BROKEN LEG AND LOSS OF BLOOD THE FURIOUS ATTEMPTS TO BEAT US OFF DID NOT SLACKEN IT WAS A DESPERATE RUNNING FIGHT AND RIGHT BRAVELY HE FOUGHT IT TO THE END
BUT IT MADE ME KEENER THAN EVER DAY BY DAY I WENT OUT ALWAYS HOPING TO GET MY CHANCE AND WHEN AT LAST THE CHANCE DID COME IT WAS QUITE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY OTHERS THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST EXPECTED
SHE NEVER MOVED A MUSCLE OR MADE A SOUND BUT KEPT THOSE EYES STEADILY FIXED ON US WE MOVED BACK A PACE OR TWO AND BEGAN TO COAX AND WHEEDLE HER BUT IT WAS NO GOOD SHE NEVER MOVED OR MADE A SOUND AND THE UNBLINKING LOOK REMAINED
JOCK HAD SEVERAL TIMES SHOWN THAT HE STRONGLY OBJECTED TO ANY INTERFERENCE WITH HIS QUARRY OTHER DOGS KAFFIRS AND EVEN WHITE MEN HAD SUFFERED OR BEEN BADLY SCARED FOR RASHLY LAYING HANDS ON WHAT HE HAD PULLED DOWN
BUT AFTER SUNRISE EVERY MINUTE'S DELAY MEANT FRESH RISK FROM THE AASVOGELS THERE IS VERY LITTLE WHICH IF LEFT UNCOVERED WILL ESCAPE THEIR EYES
KEEPING WHAT COVER THERE WAS I CAME UP SLOWLY BEHIND THEM STRUGGLING AND USING ALL THE FORCE I DARED SHORT OF SMASHING THE LEVER TO GET THE EMPTY CARTRIDGE OUT AT LAST ONE OF THE TURNS IN THE FIGHT BROUGHT ME IN VIEW AND THE KOODOO DASHED OFF AGAIN
AND THE ONLY CHANCE YOU HAVE OF GETTING ANYTHING IS WITH A RUNNING SHOT IF THEY GO STRAIGHT FROM YOU THE SHOT IS NOT A VERY DIFFICULT ONE ALTHOUGH YOU SEE NOTHING BUT THE LIFTING AND FALLING HIND QUARTERS AS THEY CANTER AWAY AND A COMMON RESULT OF SUCH A SHOT IS THE BREAKING OF ONE OF THE HIND LEGS BETWEEN THE HIP AND THE HOCK
THE STEM OF A MIMOSA HID THE SHOULDERS BUT ALL THE REST WAS PLAINLY VISIBLE AS IT STOOD THERE UTTERLY UNCONSCIOUS OF DANGER THE TREE MADE A DEAD SHOT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BUT THE RISK OF TRYING FOR ANOTHER POSITION WAS TOO GREAT AND I FIRED
HE HAD BEEN QUITE CLOSE TO IT HE SAID AND IT WAS VERY TAME
PERHAPS TO DROP DEAD WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT DAY WITH THE IMPALA WE HAD MANY GOOD DAYS TOGETHER AND MANY HARD ONES WE HAD OUR DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT WE HAD OUR TRIUMPHS AND WE WERE BOTH GETTING TO KNOW OUR WAY ABOUT BY DEGREES
THE KOODOO MADE WILD EFFORTS TO GET AT HIM BUT WITH EVERY TURN HE TURNED TOO AND DID IT SO VIGOROUSLY THAT THE STAGGERING ANIMAL SWAYED OVER AND HAD TO PLUNGE VIOLENTLY TO RECOVER ITS BALANCE
OTHERWISE HE WOULD NOT HAVE TACKLED THEM WITHOUT WORD FROM ME IT WAS ALSO SURE THAT UNTIL PAST MIDNIGHT HE HAD BEEN THERE WITH THE KOODOO WATCHING OR FIGHTING THEN WHEN HAD THE HYENAS AND WILD DOGS COME
THEY'RE TOO BIG SAID PERCY SURVEYING THEM CRITICALLY
HE HAD SO COMMITTED HIMSELF THAT THE OFFER MUST NOW BE MADE HE DID NOT SPECIALLY REGRET THAT THOUGH HE WISHED THAT HE HAD BEEN MORE RETICENT WHAT A FOOL A MAN IS TO BLURT OUT EVERYTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF A WIFE WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR HIM
THAT WAS KIND AND I WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO YOU ALL THIS ABOUT MY SISTER MUST BE GIVEN UP MUST BE GIVEN UP IT CAN NEVER LEAD TO ANY GOOD I MEAN THAT THERE NEVER CAN BE A MARRIAGE THEN HE PAUSED
THE LITTLE WHITE HEN BOWED VERY LOW BEFORE THE KING SO LOW IN FACT THAT IT MUSSED UP ALL HER FEATHERS WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS ASKED THE KING IN HIS BIG DEEP KINGLY VOICE
AND WE'LL HAVE A SPLENDID PAIR IN JUST ONE MINUTE SHE SANG AND SO THE SAILS WERE CUT OUT AND THE HEMS TURNED DOWN AND BASTED AND TUCKED AWAY INTO POLLY'S LITTLE WORK BASKET READY FOR THE SEWING ON THE MORROW
AND THERE GOES THE FIRST BELL AS THE LOUD SOUNDS UNDER JANE'S VIGOROUS RINGING PEALED UP OVER THE STAIRS THERE WON'T BE TIME ANYWAY NOW I WISH THERE WASN'T SUCH A THING AS SHOES IN THE WORLD AND SHE GAVE A FLOUNCE AND SAT UP STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER MOTHER
WHAT SAID VAN COOLING OFF A LITTLE AND ALLOWING PERCY TO EDGE INTO A CORNER WITH THE BELOVED BOAT AND ONE SAIL WHAT WILL YOU POLLY I'LL MAKE YOU ANOTHER PAIR OF SAILS SAID POLLY
WE DID MEET AS YOU SAW THE OTHER DAY BY THE MEREST CHANCE AFTER THAT DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR SISTER WISHES ME TO GIVE HER UP AS FOR SUPPOSING THAT GIRLS ARE TO HAVE WHAT THEY WISH THAT IS NONSENSE
ALL THE ROYAL FOWLS FLEW AT HER SOME PLUCKED AT HER RUMPLED WHITE FEATHERS OTHERS TRIED TO PICK OUT HER EYES ONE PULLED OFF THE COVER OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET OUT SPRANG THE FOX FROM THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET
POLLY SAID MISSUS PEPPER STERNLY DEFTLY FASTENING THE LITTLE BUTTONS TIGHTLY INTO PLACE WITH QUICK FIRM STITCHES BETTER BE GLAD YOU'VE GOT THEM TO SEW AT ALL THERE NOW HERE THEY ARE
THE MONEY WHICH GERALD OWED AT CAMBRIDGE WOULD BE NOTHING IF THAT OTHER SORROW COULD BE CONQUERED
WHERE IS THE WORK BASKET MAMSIE OH HERE IT IS ON THE WINDOW SEAT A RATTLE OF SPOOLS SCISSORS AND NECESSARY UTENSILS SHOWED PLAINLY THAT POLLY HAD FOUND IT FOLLOWED BY A JUMBLE OF WORDS AND DESPAIRING EJACULATIONS
OH HOW DOES THIS GO OH
THAT THEY SHOULD NOW PRESERVE THEIR LIVES OF WHICH THEY DESPAIRED BEFORE AND HAD THEIR MINDS FULL OF NOTHING BUT THE THOUGHTS OF DYING SO WHEN HE HAD WITH THEM RETURNED THANKS TO GOD WHO HAD COMMISERATED THEIR YOUTH WHEN IT WAS DAY
IT MEANT COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE IN MONEY MATTERS THEN HIS MIND RAN AWAY TO A REVIEW OF HIS FATHER'S AFFAIRS IT WAS A GENUINE TROUBLE TO HIM THAT HIS FATHER SHOULD BE SO UNHAPPY OF ALL THE GRIEFS WHICH WEIGHED UPON THE DUKE'S MIND
THAT SILVERBRIDGE HAD TAKEN MARY HE DID UNDERSTAND AND THAT THEY HAD TOGETHER GONE TO LORD GREX'S HOUSE HE UNDERSTOOD ALSO THAT THE MEETING HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE PRESENCE OF SILVERBRIDGE AND OF LADY MABEL NO DOUBT IT WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT
IT WAS SIMPLY AN ACCIDENT SUCH AN ACCIDENT AS MUST OCCUR OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNLESS MARY IS TO BE LOCKED UP WHO TALKS OF LOCKING ANYBODY UP WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO SPEAK IN THAT WAY
BECAUSE IT COULD NOT BE AVOIDED BUT THEIR BODIES AND COLORS MUST BE CHANGED WITH THEIR DIET ESPECIALLY WHILE THEY WOULD BE CLEARLY DISCOVERED BY THE FINER APPEARANCE OF THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO WOULD FARE BETTER AND THUS THEY SHOULD BRING HIM INTO DANGER AND OCCASION HIM TO BE PUNISHED
I WILL DO NOTHING THAT I AM ASHAMED TO TELL EVERYBODY HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY I CANNOT HELP IT HE SHOULD NOT TREAT ME AS HE IS DOING MISTER TREGEAR IS A GENTLEMAN WHY DID HE LET HIM COME WHY DID YOU BRING HIM
TO CARRY A LETTER TO THE KING INDEED LITTLE WHITE HEN SAID THE FOX
AND HE WAS LEAVING HER WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO THE SCENE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE WHEN AN IDEA STRUCK HIM THAT THIS WOULD BE CRUEL MARY HE SAID I WAS VERY SORRY FOR ALL THAT IT WAS NOT MY DOING
BUT STILL IT SEEMED HARD TO HIM THAT THIS INTENTION OF MARRIAGE SHOULD STAND IN HIS WAY OF HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH MISS BONCASSEN FOR A FEW WEEKS NO DOUBT THERE WERE OBJECTIONS TO MARRIAGE IT CLIPPED A FELLOW'S WINGS BUT THEN IF HE WERE MARRIED
IT IS QUITE CLEAR SHE ADDED THAT THIS IS NOT A PASSING FANCY ON HER PART
O LITTLE WHITE HEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING THE RIVER CALLED OUT AS SOON AS HE SAW HER
THIS WAS DONE BY THE POWER OF GOD
BUT TO GIVE THEM PULSE AND DATES FOR THEIR FOOD AND ANY THING ELSE BESIDES THE FLESH OF LIVING CREATURES THAT HE PLEASED FOR THAT THEIR INCLINATIONS WERE TO THAT SORT OF FOOD AND THAT THEY DESPISED THE OTHER
BUT TREGEAR WAS DETERMINED TO HEAR HIM OUT IT IS MAKING MY FATHER SO MISERABLE THAT YOU WOULD PITY HIM IF YOU COULD SEE HIM I DARE SAY I SHOULD WHEN I SEE PEOPLE UNHAPPY I ALWAYS PITY THEM WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK OF IS THIS
HOW THE SPECKLED HEN GOT HER SPECKLES ONCE UPON A TIME AGES AND AGES AGO THERE WAS A LITTLE WHITE HEN ONE DAY SHE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED IN SCRATCHING THE SOIL
WITH A LITTLE LAUGH BEGINNING TO BE VERY MUCH ASHAMED WHAT COULD YOU DO WITH YOUR LITTLE MITES OF HANDS PULLING THIS BIG THREAD THROUGH THAT OLD LEATHER
SILVERBRIDGE FOUND IT TO BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY ANYTHING IN ANSWER TO THIS ARE YOU GOING TO CHURCH ASKED THE DUKE I WAS NOT THINKING OF DOING SO PARTICULARLY DO YOU NOT EVER GO
AND WERE THEIRS JUST LIKE THIS ASKED PERCY LAYING HIS HAND ON THE SAIL SHE HAD FINISHED CUTTING OUT PRE CISELY SAID POLLY WITH A PIN IN HER MOUTH JUST AS LIKE AS TWO PEAS PERCY WHITNEY THEN I LIKE THEM CRIED PERCY
BUT IT IS OF NO USE THE THING IS SETTLED PAPA CAN BREAK MY HEART
BUT THE DUKE'S CHARACTER ADDED MUCH TO THE SEVERITY OF THE TASK AND THEN THAT EMBRACE SHE KNEW THAT THE DUKE WOULD BE STRUCK WITH HORROR AS HE READ OF SUCH A TALE AND SHE FOUND HERSELF ALMOST STRUCK WITH HORROR AS SHE ATTEMPTED TO WRITE IT
YOU ARE QUITE AT LIBERTY TO TELL HIM THAT I SAY SO I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK YOUR FATHER FOR A PENNY AND I WILL NEVER DO SO THE POWER IS ALL IN HIS HANDS AS FAR AS I KNOW MY OWN PURPOSES I SHALL NOT MAKE ANY IMMEDIATE ATTEMPT EVEN TO SEE HER
SAID POLLY SITTING DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND PULLING ON HER STOCKINGS THERE NOW SEE THAT HATEFUL OLD SHOE MAMSIE AND SHE THRUST OUT ONE FOOT IN DISMAY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH IT
IF YOU ALL HAD NOT BEEN THERE THEN AGAIN SHE BURST INTO TEARS HE DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT
HIMSELF AND HIS THREE KINSMEN WERE IN DANGER
THIS MUST BE A LETTER ONE TIME WHEN THE KING THE GREAT RULER OF OUR COUNTRY
AND DESIRED TO KNOW OF HIM WHAT WAS THE REASON WHY THE KING HAD GIVEN COMMAND THAT ALL THE WISE MEN AND CHALDEANS AND MAGICIANS SHOULD BE SLAIN SO WHEN HE HAD LEARNED THAT THE KING HAD HAD A DREAM AND HAD FORGOTTEN IT AND THAT WHEN THEY WERE ENJOINED TO INFORM THE KING OF IT
BUT THE LEGS AND THE FEET OF IRON AFTER WHICH THOU SAWEST A STONE
AND THEN MISTER KING CAME IN AND TOOK JASPER OFF WITH HIM
AND THEY HAD NOW EXERCISED THEMSELVES SUFFICIENTLY IN THAT WISDOM WHICH HE HAD ORDERED THEY SHOULD APPLY THEMSELVES TO NOW AMONG THESE THERE WERE FOUR OF THE FAMILY OF ZEDEKIAH OF MOST EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS ONE OF WHOM WAS CALLED DANIEL
FOR AFTER HE HAD CONTINUED IN THE WILDERNESS THE FOREMENTIONED INTERVAL OF TIME WHILE NO ONE DURST ATTEMPT TO SEIZE HIS KINGDOM DURING THOSE SEVEN YEARS HE PRAYED TO GOD THAT HE MIGHT RECOVER HIS KINGDOM AND HE RETURNED TO IT
SAID MISSUS PEPPER STRAIGHTENING THE THINGS ON THE BUREAU YOU HAVEN'T WORN IT OUT ALREADY POLLY OH NO SAID POLLY WITH A LITTLE LAUGH
THAT THE WHOLE EARTH BENEATH IT SEEMED TO BE FILLED THEREWITH THIS IS THE DREAM WHICH THOU SAWEST AND ITS INTERPRETATION IS AS FOLLOWS THE HEAD OF GOLD DENOTES THEE AND THE KINGS OF BABYLON THAT HAVE BEEN BEFORE THEE
TAKE THIS STUPID LITTLE WHITE HEN AND THROW HER OUT INTO THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD I THINK WE WILL HAVE HER FOR DINNER TO MORROW THE LITTLE WHITE HEN WAS ROUGHLY SEIZED BY THE TALLEST ROYAL ATTENDANT AND CARRIED DOWN THE BACK STAIRS
SO THESE MEN WERE CONVICTED AND CAST IMMEDIATELY INTO THE FIRE BUT WERE SAVED BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE
IF YOU MEAN BY CONTROLLING MYSELF HOLDING MY TONGUE HE IS THE MAN I LOVE WHOM I HAVE PROMISED TO MARRY BUT MARY DO LADIES GENERALLY EMBRACE THEIR LOVERS IN PUBLIC NO NOR SHOULD I
HE SHOULD REDUCE THEM TO THEIR FORMER DIET NOW WHEN IT APPEARED THAT THEY WERE SO FAR FROM BECOMING WORSE BY THE USE OF THIS FOOD THAT THEY GREW PLUMPER AND FULLER IN BODY THAN THE REST
THAT TOOK ALL POLLY'S PATIENCE TO UNRAVEL IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE IN SUCH A HURRY SAID MISSUS PEPPER
HE CAME TO ARIOCH AND DESIRED HIM TO BRING HIM TO THE KING
OH THAT CORNER'S COMING OFF CRIED POLLY CHEERFULLY GIVING IT A SHARP CUT
NOW I TOO EVEN I THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAVE A LETTER I AM GOING TO CARRY MY LETTER TO THE KING THE NEXT MORNING THE LITTLE WHITE HEN STARTED BRAVELY OUT ON HER LONG JOURNEY
ON THAT NIGHT MARY TOLD THE WHOLE OF HER STORY TO LADY CANTRIP THERE WAS NOTHING THAT SHE TRIED TO CONCEAL I GOT UP SHE SAID AND THREW MY ARMS ROUND HIM IS HE NOT ALL THE WORLD TO ME
HE FELL UPON THE FOWLS OF THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD NOT A SINGLE FOWL WAS LEFT ALIVE THERE WAS SUCH A GREAT COMMOTION THAT THE KING THE QUEEN THE ROYAL ATTENDANTS AND ALL THE ROYAL SERVANTS OF THE PALACE
NOT EXACTLY SIR IT IS DIFFERENT WITH YOU BUT A MAN LET HIM BE WHO HE MAY SHOULD LIVE WITHIN CERTAIN MEANS AS FOR YOUR SISTER I THINK SHE WILL BREAK MY HEART
SINCE THEY CONFESSED THEY COULD NOT DO WHAT THEY WERE COMMANDED TO DO NOW WHEN DANIEL HEARD THAT THE KING HAD GIVEN A COMMAND THAT ALL THE WISE MEN SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH
BUT TWAS ALL OF NO USE THE DAY SEEMED TO BE ALWAYS JUST RACING AHEAD OF HER AND TURNING A CORNER BEFORE SHE COULD CATCH UP TO IT AND BEN AND THE OTHER BOYS ONLY CAUGHT DISSOLVING VIEWS OF HER AS SHE FLITTED THROUGH HALLS OR OVER STAIRS
AS VAN BOUNDED IN WITH A TORRENT OF COMPLAINTS AND GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT IN EVERY LINE OF HIS FACE OH NOW THAT'S TOO BAD HE CRIED SEEING POLLY FOLD UP THE REMAINING BITS OF CLOTH
BUT THE TWO HANDS AND ARMS SIGNIFY THIS THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT SHALL BE DISSOLVED BY TWO KINGS BUT ANOTHER KING THAT SHALL COME FROM THE WEST ARMED WITH BRASS SHALL DESTROY THAT GOVERNMENT AND ANOTHER GOVERNMENT
HE MADE AN IMAGE OF GOLD WHOSE HEIGHT WAS SIXTY CUBITS AND ITS BREADTH SIX CUBITS AND SET IT IN THE GREAT PLAIN OF BABYLON AND WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DEDICATE THE IMAGE HE INVITED THE PRINCIPAL MEN OUT OF ALL THE EARTH THAT WAS UNDER HIS DOMINIONS
YOU'RE A MEAN OLD HATEFUL THING PERCY WHITNEY OH DON'T
ARIOCH FROM THAT TIME SECURELY TOOK HIMSELF WHAT THE KING SENT EVERY DAY FROM HIS SUPPER ACCORDING TO CUSTOM TO THE CHILDREN BUT GAVE THEM THE FOREMENTIONED DIET
I NEVER DID SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE BEFORE BUT AS HE WAS THERE I HAD TO SHOW THAT I WAS NOT ASHAMED OF HIM
SHE HANDED THE KING THE PIECE OF PAPER WHICH HAD REMAINED ALL THIS TIME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET THERE WERE MARKS OF DIRT UPON IT WHERE THE FRIENDLY FOX'S FEET HAD RESTED IT WAS DAMP WHERE THE RIVER HAD LAIN
SHE HAD HELPED THE FOX TO ESCAPE FROM A TRAP AND THE FOX HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN HER KINDNESS TO HIM O LITTLE WHITE HEN WHERE ARE YOU GOING ASKED THE FOX
IS IT ASKED PERCY LOOKING WITH MORE RESPECT AT THE PIECE OF CLOTH POLLY WAS WAVING ALLURINGLY BEFORE HIM JUST EXACTLY LIKE IT POLLY YES SAID POLLY
AND I'M A HATEFUL CROSS OLD BEAR SO I AM SHE CRIED REMORSEFULLY BUTTONING HERSELF INTO HER BOOTS
AND MADE HIM AND HIS KINSMEN RULERS OF HIS WHOLE KINGDOM WHICH KINSMEN OF HIS HAPPENED TO FALL INTO GREAT DANGER BY THE ENVY AND MALICE OF THEIR ENEMIES FOR THEY OFFENDED THE KING UPON THE OCCASION FOLLOWING
WHEN UPON THEIR ENTIRE INABILITY TO DISCOVER HIS DREAM HE WAS UNDERTAKING TO INFORM HIM OF IT FOR THIS WAS NOT BY HIS OWN SKILL OR ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HAVING BETTER CULTIVATED HIS UNDERSTANDING THAN THE REST BUT HE SAID
ALL HEMMED AND EVERYTHING THERE AS SHE HELD ONE UP FOR INSPECTION
WATCHING HER MAKE A BIG KNOT BUT THE KNOT DIDN'T STAY FOR WHEN POLLY DREW UP THE LONG THREAD TRIUMPHANTLY TO THE END OUT IT FLEW AND AWAY THE BUTTON HOPPED AGAIN AS IF GLAD TO BE RELEASED AND THEN THE THREAD KINKED HORRIBLY
SAID PHRONSIE TUCKING UP HER TOES UNDER THE NIGHT GOWN BUT POLLY HURRIED HER INTO BED
AND NOW STOOD TO LOSE SOME TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS ON THE DOINGS OF THE LAST NIGHT AND HE HAD MADE THESE BETS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MAJOR TIFTO
GROANING WITHIN HERSELF AS SHE THOUGHT OF THE WASTED MINUTES AND THEN YOU CAN SEE ME CUT EM VAN WILL YOU REALLY HE SAID DELIGHT COMING ALL OVER HIS FLUSHED FACE YES I WILL CRIED POLLY
AFTER A WHILE SHE MET A FRIENDLY FOX FOXES AND LITTLE WHITE HENS ARE NOT USUALLY VERY GOOD FRIENDS YOU KNOW BUT THIS FOX WAS A FRIEND OF THE LITTLE WHITE HEN ONCE UPON A TIME
THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD ALL RAN AFTER HER IN SWIFT PURSUIT THEY HAD ALMOST CAUGHT HER WHEN THE RIVER SUDDENLY SPRANG OUT OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET AND FLOWED BETWEEN THE LITTLE WHITE HEN AND HER ROYAL PURSUERS THEY COULDN'T GET ACROSS WITHOUT CANOES
WAIT A MINUTE TILL I GET SOME MORE CLOTH AND SHE STARTED FOR THE DOOR OH NOW THAT'S TOO BAD SAID JASPER
SAID JASPER QUICKLY YOU'RE ALWAYS TEASING HER TO DO SOMETHING HE ADDED I DIDN'T TEASE SAID PERCY INDIGNANTLY COMING UP TO THE SOFA BOAT IN HAND TO ENFORCE HIS WORDS
THAT SHALL BE LIKE UNTO IRON SHALL PUT AN END TO THE POWER OF THE FORMER AND SHALL HAVE DOMINION OVER ALL THE EARTH ON ACCOUNT OF THE NATURE OF IRON WHICH IS STRONGER THAN THAT OF GOLD OF SILVER AND OF BRASS
ABEDNEGO THESE THE KING HAD IN ESTEEM AND CONTINUED TO LOVE BECAUSE OF THE VERY EXCELLENT TEMPER THEY WERE OF AND BECAUSE OF THEIR APPLICATION TO LEARNING
NOW I WANT YOU TO TELL PAPA ALL ABOUT IT LADY CANTRIP BEGAN TO THINK THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EVIL DAY FOR HER WHEN SHE HAD AGREED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THIS VERY DETERMINED YOUNG LADY BUT SHE CONSENTED AT ONCE TO WRITE TO THE DUKE
I WOULD RATHER YOU WROTE THE LETTER SAID LADY MARY BUT PRAY TELL HIM THAT ALL ALONG I HAVE MEANT HIM TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT TILL LADY CANTRIP SEATED HERSELF AT HER WRITING TABLE
AND PIANO PLAYING ISN'T VERY NICE WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO STICK YOUR TOES UNDER IT TO KEEP YOUR SHOES ON WELL THEN GRUMBLED POLLY
FOR THE FIRE DID NOT TOUCH THEM AND I SUPPOSE THAT IT TOUCHED THEM NOT AS IF IT REASONED WITH ITSELF THAT THEY WERE CAST INTO IT WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF THEIRS AND THAT THEREFORE IT WAS TOO WEAK TO BURN THE YOUNG MEN WHEN THEY WERE IN IT
HE MIGHT BE SURE THAT TIFTO WOULD BE LAID ASIDE
THAT IT COULD NOT CONSUME THEM THIS IT WAS WHICH RECOMMENDED THEM TO THE KING AS RIGHTEOUS MEN AND MEN BELOVED OF GOD
HE HAD WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THROWN SOME UGLY WORMS UPON THE BANK AND HE WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD CRAWL BACK IN AGAIN THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD EATEN THEM FOR HIM ALWAYS AFTER THAT THE RIVER HAD BEEN HER FRIEND
SO THEY READILY UNDERSTOOD ALL THE LEARNING THAT WAS AMONG THE HEBREWS AND AMONG THE CHALDEANS AS ESPECIALLY DID DANIEL WHO BEING ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY SKILLFUL IN WISDOM WAS VERY BUSY ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
AND WHERE COULD HE POSSIBLY FIND A BETTER WIFE THAN MABEL GREX IN BEAUTY SHE WAS NO DOUBT INFERIOR TO MISS BONCASSEN THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT MISS BONCASSEN WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORGET HER BUT MISS BONCASSEN WAS AN AMERICAN AND ON MANY ACCOUNTS OUT OF THE QUESTION
YOU DID SAY SO POLLY YOU KNOW YOU DID OF COURSE I DID VANNY SAID POLLY
AND COMMANDED THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WHEN THEY SHOULD HEAR THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET THEY SHOULD THEN FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP THE IMAGE
IF TREGEAR COULD BE GOT OUT OF THE WAY HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE RECONCILED TO OTHER THINGS HE FELT VERY TENDER HEARTED ABOUT HIS FATHER
SHOULD BE CAST INTO A FIERY FURNACE WHEN THEREFORE ALL THE REST UPON THE HEARING OF THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET WORSHIPPED THE IMAGE THEY RELATE THAT DANIEL'S KINSMEN DID NOT DO IT BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT TRANSGRESS THE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRY
OH MAMSIE CRIED POLLY IGNORING FOR A MOMENT THE DELIGHTS OF THE FINISHED SHOE TO FLING HER ARMS AROUND HER MOTHER'S NECK AND GIVE HER A GOOD HUG YOU'RE JUST THE SPLENDIDEST GOODEST MAMSIE IN ALL THE WORLD
WHICH COURSE HE TOOK ALSO WITH THOSE OF OTHER NATIONS WHOM HE HAD TAKEN IN THE FLOWER OF THEIR AGE AND AFFORDED THEM THEIR DIET FROM HIS OWN TABLE AND HAD THEM INSTRUCTED IN THE INSTITUTES OF THE COUNTRY AND TAUGHT THE LEARNING OF THE CHALDEANS
O LITTLE WHITE HEN MAY I GO WITH YOU ASKED THE RIVER THE LITTLE WHITE HEN TOLD THE RIVER THAT HE MIGHT GO WITH HER AND ASKED HIM TO RIDE IN THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET SO THE RIVER CLIMBED INTO THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET
AFTER THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD JOURNEYED ALONG FOR A TIME SHE CAME TO A FIRE ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE FIRE HAD BEEN DYING THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD BROUGHT SOME DRIED GRASS THE GRASS HAD GIVEN THE FIRE NEW LIFE
THEN THE FIRE WHICH HAD CHANGED ITSELF INTO HOT ASHES JUMPED OUT OF THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET IT IMMEDIATELY BECAME DARK SO DARK THAT THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD COULD NOT EVEN SEE EACH OTHER'S FACES AND OF COURSE
BUT OF WHOM YOU WOULD SAY AFTER DUE OBSERVATION THAT HE HAD NOT AS YET PUT OFF ALL HIS CHILDISH WAYS HE NOW SAT WITH HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT WITH HIS CANE IN HIS HANDS
FOR IT WAS I FEAR IN THAT WAY THAT HE HAD LOOKED AT IT DID NOT SEE ANY REASON FOR PERFORMING A DUTY WHICH HIS FATHER HIMSELF OMITTED AND THERE WERE VARIOUS MATTERS ALSO WHICH HARASSED HIM ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AFTER DINNER
THERE NOW LET MOTHER SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER OH DEAR SAID POLLY RESIGNING THE NEEDLE WITH A BIG SIGH AND LEANING BACK TO TAKE A GOOD STRETCH FOLLOWED BY PHRONSIE'S SYMPATHIZING EYES
BUT YET AS HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN HE SHUDDERED WITH VEXATION I WAS THINKING OF THE GOVERNOR HE SAID HE SHALL BE TOLD EVERYTHING THAT YOU MET TREGEAR CERTAINLY AND THAT I KISSED HIM
FOR YOUNG MEN I SUPPOSE EQUALLY SO LIFE OUGHT TO BE A LIFE OF SELF DENIAL NO DOUBT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MY DUTY TO RETIRE FROM THIS AFFAIR IF BY DOING SO I SHOULD SACRIFICE ONLY MYSELF
AND TO ABSTAIN FROM THOSE KINDS OF FOOD WHICH CAME FROM THE KING'S TABLE AND ENTIRELY TO FORBEAR TO EAT OF ALL LIVING CREATURES
AND TO PUT OFF THEIR SLAUGHTER SO LONG FOR THAT HE HOPED WITHIN THAT TIME TO OBTAIN BY PRAYER TO GOD THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DREAM ACCORDINGLY ARIOCH INFORMED THE KING OF WHAT DANIEL DESIRED
I ONLY MEANT THAT OF COURSE THEY WILL STUMBLE ACROSS EACH OTHER IN LONDON I THINK I WILL GO ABROAD SAID THE DUKE HE WAS SILENT FOR AWHILE AND THEN REPEATED HIS WORDS I THINK I WILL GO ABROAD NOT FOR LONG I HOPE SIR
EVERYTHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH POLLY THAT DAY IT BEGAN WITH HER BOOTS OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD THAT TRIED POLLY'S PATIENCE MOST WERE THE TROUBLESOME LITTLE BLACK BUTTONS THAT ORIGINALLY ADORNED THOSE USEFUL PARTS OF HER CLOTHING
SHE CARRIED THE LETTER VERY CAREFULLY IN HER LITTLE BROWN BASKET IT WAS A LONG DISTANCE TO THE ROYAL PALACE WHERE THE KING LIVED THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD NEVER BEEN SO FAR FROM HOME IN ALL HER LIFE
SAID POLLY SNIPPING AWAY VIGOROUSLY AND LONGING TO GET BACK TO MAMSIE
WHY SHE SAID SHE'D MAKE VAN AND ME OUR SAILS YOU KNOW SAID PERCY HOLDING UP A RATHER FORLORN LOOKING SPECIMEN OF A BOAT BUT WHICH THE BOYS HAD CARVED WITH THE GREATEST ENTHUSIASM
I COULDN'T COME BEFORE MAMSIE WANTED ME NOW SAYS I FOR THE SAILS AND SHE BEGAN TO FLAP OUT A LONG WHITE PIECE OF COTTON CLOTH ON THE TABLE TO TRIM INTO JUST THE DESIRED SHAPE THAT ISN'T THE WAY
WITH ALL MY HEART SAID TREGEAR SIT DOWN HERE SAID SILVERBRIDGE
LADY CANTRIP WROTE HOW COULD IT BE AN ACCIDENT YOU HAD MARY UP IN TOWN ON FRIDAY
I AM HIGHLY OFFENDED I ALWAYS KNEW THAT HENS WERE STUPID LITTLE CREATURES BUT YOU ARE QUITE THE STUPIDEST LITTLE HEN I EVER SAW IN ALL MY LIFE HERE AND HE TURNED TO ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS STANDING BY THE THRONE
THAT WAS WHEN I WAS EVER SO LITTLE
THROUGH THE BACK GATE OUT INTO THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD SHE STILL CLUNG TO THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER ON HER LONG JOURNEY TO THE ROYAL PALACE AND THROUGH ALL THE SAD EXPERIENCES SHE HAD MET THERE WHEN THE LITTLE WHITE HEN REACHED THE ROYAL POULTRY YARD
I THINK I PERHAPS MIGHT EXPRESS SUCH AN OPINION WELL THEN I HAVE TO EXAMINE MYSELF AND FIND OUT WHETHER I AM GUILTY OF THE MEANNESS WHICH I MIGHT PERHAPS BE TOO READY TO IMPUTE TO ANOTHER I HAVE DONE SO
I WISH THEY'D ALL GO THEY MIGHT AS WELL SHE CRIED TOSSING THAT BOOT ON THE FLOOR IN INTENSE SCORN WHILE SHE INVESTIGATED THE STATE OF THE OTHER ONE
I KNEW HE HAD A FEW HORSES THERE IT IS NOT THE MONEY BUT THE ABSENCE OF PRINCIPLE THAT A YOUNG MAN SHOULD HAVE NO FEELING THAT HE OUGHT TO LIVE WITHIN CERTAIN PRESCRIBED MEANS
HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BACK THE PRIME MINISTER FOR THE LEGER TO A VERY SERIOUS AMOUNT
NOBODY'LL SEE ME IF I TUCK MY FOOT UNDER THE PIANO AND I CAN SEW EM ON AFTERWARDS THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME DO JUST ONCE MAMSIE NO SAID MISSUS PEPPER FIRMLY THERE ISN'T ANY TIME BUT NOW
IN MY LITTLE BROWN BASKET THE FOX CLIMBED INTO THE LITTLE BROWN BASKET AFTER THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD GONE ON FOR SOME DISTANCE FARTHER SHE MET A RIVER ONCE UPON A TIME THE LITTLE WHITE HEN HAD DONE THE RIVER A KINDNESS
WHEN SHE CAME TO THE POINT SHE FOUND SHE COULD NOT WRITE IT I FEAR THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF WARMTH SHOWN ON BOTH SIDES SHE SAID FEELING THAT SHE WAS CALUMNIATING THE MAN AS TO WHOSE WARMTH SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING
SINCE I HAVE ONLY UNDERTAKEN TO DESCRIBE THINGS PAST OR THINGS PRESENT BUT NOT THINGS THAT ARE FUTURE YET IF ANY ONE BE SO VERY DESIROUS OF KNOWING TRUTH AS NOT TO WAVE SUCH POINTS OF CURIOSITY AND CANNOT CURB HIS INCLINATION
OH NO I WON'T I WON'T HE CRIED IN THE GREATEST ALARM
BUT THE YOUNG MAN RETIRED TO HIS OWN HOUSE WITH HIS KINSMEN AND BESOUGHT GOD THAT WHOLE NIGHT TO DISCOVER THE DREAM AND THEREBY DELIVER THE MAGICIANS AND CHALDEANS WITH WHOM THEY WERE THEMSELVES TO PERISH FROM THE KING'S ANGER
KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR SAW A WONDERFUL DREAM THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF WHICH GOD SHOWED HIM IN HIS SLEEP BUT WHEN HE AROSE OUT OF HIS BED HE FORGOT THE ACCOMPLISHMENT SO HE SENT FOR THE CHALDEANS AND MAGICIANS AND THE PROPHETS AND TOLD THEM THAT HE HAD SEEN A DREAM
AND YOU SHAN'T HAVE EM SO HE CRIED MAKING A LUNGE AT THE ONE ON THE TABLE FOR I MADE MOST OF THE BOAT THERE OH NO YOU DIDN'T CRIED PERCY IN THE GREATEST ALARM
THE GRASS THE ROSE NOW SINCE HE CHERISHED THE ROSE SO WELL SEE THE ROSE WILL NOT LEAVE HIM OUT OF THE DUST IT RISES IT GROWS IT BLOOMS AGAINST HIS LIPS IT PRESSES IT IS THE BEGINNING
I SAW THE SMALL LOW HILLS WELL COVERED WITH SHORT OAKS AND HAZEL BUSHES WHICH ROLLED ON AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE FAR OUT ALMOST TO THE DELECTABLE MOUNTAINS WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN TO BE UPON THE EDGE OF THE WORLD
I EXPERIENCED A SENTIMENT HALF OF HORROR HALF OF REMORSE FOR THE CRIME OF WHICH I HAD BEEN GUILTY BUT IT WAS AT BEST A FEEBLE AND EQUIVOCAL FEELING AND THE SOUL REMAINED UNTOUCHED
AND SO I GAZED WHERE THE SINGING MOUSE POINTED QUITE BEYOND THE DUSTY WALLS AND THERE I SAW AS IT HAD SAID I HEARD NOT THE THUNDER OF THE HOOFS OF BUFFALO NOR THE FAINT CRACK OF THE TWIG BENEATH THE PANTHER'S FOOT
MAD INDEED WOULD I BE TO EXPECT IT IN A CASE WHERE MY VERY SENSES REJECT THEIR OWN EVIDENCE YET MAD AM I NOT AND VERY SURELY DO I NOT DREAM BUT TOMORROW I DIE AND TODAY I WOULD UNBURTHEN MY SOUL
AH WHAT DOES THIS MAN MEAN WHO WHISPERS TO HIMSELF IN RIDDLES LOOK IT IS THE TIME OF WAR THERE IS MUSIC THE BLOOD STINGS THE HEART LEAPS THE EYE FLAMES
MY ORIGINAL SOUL SEEMED AT ONCE TO TAKE ITS FLIGHT FROM MY BODY AND A MORE THAN FIENDISH MALEVOLENCE GIN NURTURED THRILLED EVERY FIBER OF MY FRAME I TOOK FROM MY WAISTCOAT POCKET A PENKNIFE OPENED IT
NO IT WAS NONE OF THESE THAT CAME TO MIND NOR DID THE MOUNTAINS NOR THE PLAINS NOR THE WILDERNESS OF THE PINES BUT WHEN THE SINGING MOUSE WHISPERED DO YOU SEE I MURMURED IN REPLY I SEE IT ALL AGAIN
MARCHED UP INTO THE DOORYARD BEARING ON A POLE BETWEEN THEM THEIR QUARRY WELL SUSPENDED BY THE GAMBRELS MY BOYS I FEARED THAT YOU WERE LOST EXCLAIMS THE TEARFUL MOTHER WHO STANDS WAITING IN THE DOOR
FATHER MUST BE ASKED ABOUT THIS TREMENDOUS STARTLING BIRD MEANTIME THE HEART HAVING BEGUN TO BEAT AGAIN LET THE TWO ADVENTURERS PRESS YET A LITTLE FARTHER ON AND SO WITH FEARS AND TREMBLINGS WITH DOUBTS AND JOYS
WHICH CONSTITUTED THE CHIEF FURNITURE OF THE APARTMENT I HAD BEEN LOOKING STEADILY AT THE TOP OF THIS HOGSHEAD FOR SOME MINUTES AND WHAT NOW CAUSED ME SURPRISE WAS THE FACT THAT I HAD NOT SOONER PERCEIVED THE OBJECT THEREUPON
IT SET IN MOTION MANY SHADOWS WHICH HAD THEIR HOME IN THE CORNERS OF THE WALLS AND BADE THEM CEASE THEIR SULLENNESS AND COME FORTH TO DANCE IN THE RIOT OF THE HOUR AND SO EACH SHADOW FOUND ITS PARTNER IN A RAY OF FIRELIGHT AND THERE THEY DANCED
WONDERING AT THESE WORDS I SCARCE COULD TELL WHEN THE SINGING MOUSE WENT AWAY LEAVING ME STARING AT THE BARREN WALLS AND AT THE WHITE SKULL BY MY HAND FOR A MOMENT IT NEARLY SEEMED TO ME THE HOLLOW EYES HAD LIGHT AND SPOKE TO ME
FEAR VANISHED AT THE SIGHT OF THE QUARRY AND THE ONLY THOUGHT REMAINING WAS THAT OF BATTLE AND OF VICTORY WELL FOR THE ANIMAL THAT IT RAN ILL FOR IT THAT IT RAN DOWN THE ROAD AND NOT BACK INTO THE COVER
THIS WAS THE CAT'S NAME WAS MY FAVOURITE PET AND PLAYMATE I ALONE FED HIM AND HE ATTENDED ME WHEREVER I WENT ABOUT THE HOUSE IT WAS EVEN WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I COULD PREVENT HIM FROM FOLLOWING ME THROUGH THE STREETS
BUT AT LENGTH REFLECTION CAME TO MY AID THE CAT I REMEMBERED HAD BEEN HUNG IN A GARDEN ADJACENT TO THE HOUSE UPON THE ALARM OF FIRE THIS GARDEN HAD BEEN IMMEDIATELY FILLED BY THE CROWD
CLUTCH CLOSER LITTLE BROTHER THOUGH BOTH BE PALE HOW SHOULD EITHER OF YOU YET KNOW THE THUNDEROUS FLIGHT OF THE WILD GROUSE THIS GREAT BIRD WHICH WHIRLED AWAY THROUGH THE BROWN LEAVES OF THE OAKS
IT IS HE WHO SAID IN THE MOUNTAINS THAT RIDDLE OF THE END AND THE BEGINNING WHO KNEW THAT TO THE HEART OF NATURE WE MUST COME FOR EITHER THE END OR THE BEGINNING OF THIS OUR LIFE DO YOU SEE UPON HIS BREAST THE RED ROSE
THE GRASS HERE WAS SO GREEN IT IS RED THE ROSE UPON HIS BREAST IS RED HIS FACE IS WHITE BUT STILL THE SMILE IS THERE AND NOW IT IS CALMER AND MORE SWEET THOUGH STILL HE WHISPERS
WHICH GOES DIRECTLY TO THE HEART OF HIM WHO HAS HAD FREQUENT OCCASION TO TEST THE PALTRY FRIENDSHIP AND GOSSAMER FIDELITY OF MERE MAN
THERE THOUGHT I IS THE STAG WHICH ONCE FELL FAR IN THE PINE WOODS OF THE NORTH THIS ANTELOPE TAKES ME BACK TO THE HARD WHITE PLAINS THESE HUGE ANTLERS COULD GROW ONLY AMID THE FORESTS OF THE ROCKIES THAT WOLF
A DEADLY SIN THAT WOULD SO JEOPARDIZE MY IMMORTAL SOUL AS TO PLACE IT IF SUCH A THING WERE POSSIBLE EVEN BEYOND THE REACH OF THE INFINITE MERCY OF THE MOST MERCIFUL AND MOST TERRIBLE GOD ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY ON WHICH THIS CRUEL DEED WAS DONE
I APPROACHED IT AND TOUCHED IT WITH MY HAND IT WAS A BLACK CAT A VERY LARGE ONE FULLY AS LARGE AS PLUTO AND CLOSELY RESEMBLING HIM IN EVERY RESPECT BUT ONE
I AGAIN PLUNGED INTO EXCESS AND SOON DROWNED IN WINE ALL MEMORY OF THE DEED IN THE MEANTIME THE CAT SLOWLY RECOVERED THE SOCKET OF THE LOST EYE PRESENTED IT IS TRUE A FRIGHTFUL APPEARANCE
THEY CROSSED THE GRINNING SKULL OF THE GRAY WOLF THEY SOFTENED THE EYES OF THE ANTELOPE'S HEAD AND MADE DARK LINES BEHIND THE LONG TINED ANTLERS OF THE ELK AND OF THE DEER
BE KINDLY FOR BY MOONLIGHT ONE STILL MAY LABOR AND HERE IS LABOR TO BE DONE EVERY BLADE IN THE BARLOW KNIVES IS BROKEN THE HOLE IN THE STUMP YIELDS NOT TO SLASHINGS NOR TO ATTEMPTS TO PRY IT OPEN
MY PETS OF COURSE WERE MADE TO FEEL THE CHANGE IN MY DISPOSITION I NOT ONLY NEGLECTED BUT ILL USED THEM FOR PLUTO HOWEVER I STILL RETAINED SUFFICIENT REGARD TO RESTRAIN ME FROM MALTREATING HIM
RUSTLE NOW YE LEAVES AND THREATEN NOW ALL YE BOUGHS WITH MENACINGS
TO DO WRONG FOR THE WRONG'S SAKE ONLY THAT URGED ME TO CONTINUE AND FINALLY TO CONSUMMATE THE INJURY I HAD INFLICTED UPON THE UNOFFENDING BRUTE ONE MORNING IN COOL BLOOD I SLIPPED A NOOSE ABOUT ITS NECK AND HUNG IT TO THE LIMB OF A TREE
THE MOUTH MUST HAVE BEEN DRY WITH THE ARDOR OF THE CHASE AT THOSE TIMES BUT NOW BUT WHY DOES THE HEART LEAP TO NIGHT DO THE VEINS FILL WITH THE RUSH OF THE BLOOD TUMULTUOUS IN THE JOY OF STIMULUS OR DANGER
A FACT WHICH I ATTRIBUTED TO ITS HAVING RECENTLY SPREAD ABOUT THIS WALL A DENSE CROWD WERE COLLECTED AND MANY PERSONS SEEMED TO BE EXAMINING A PARTICULAR PORTION OF IT WITH VERY MINUTE AND EAGER ATTENTION THE WORDS STRANGE
HARK I HEAR THE SINGING OF THIS UNSEEN THING SEE HE OF THE ROSE IS BITTEN HE HAS FALLEN AY AY HE WAS SO BRAVE AND STRONG HIS HORSE HAS GONE HE IS ALONE
THOUGH IT WAS STILL CLEAR AND RESONANT IN ITS OWN PECULIAR WAY AND VERY FINE AND SWEET I WILL TELL YOU WHICH TROPHY YOU MOST PRIZE IT SAID I WILL SHOW YOU YOUR ILIAD OF THE CHASE DO YOU NOT REMEMBER
THE TRAMP OF HURRYING HOOFS THE FALLING OF MEN WHO DIE CAN YOU SEE THIS CAN YOU CATCH THE HORROR THE EXULTATION THE JOY OF THIS I SAY THEY COME THEY GO THEY RUN THEIR RACE
AND HE WHO THINKS MUST WEEP HE LEAVES THE SHIP AND THE IRON RAIL AND HIS ROAD IS NARROWER AND SLOWER FOR HE TRAVELS NOW BY WHEELS OF WOOD HE SEES THE VALLEYS AND HIS SMILE HAS MORE OF PEACE
SOME INTELLECT MORE CALM MORE LOGICAL AND FAR LESS EXCITABLE THAN MY OWN WHICH WILL PERCEIVE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DETAIL WITH AWE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ORDINARY SUCCESSION OF VERY NATURAL CAUSES AND EFFECTS
WHO HAS NOT A HUNDRED TIMES FOUND HIMSELF COMMITTING A VILE OR A SILLY ACTION FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE SHOULD NOT HAVE WE NOT A PERPETUAL INCLINATION IN THE TEETH OF OUR BEST JUDGMENT TO VIOLATE THAT WHICH IS LAW
AND TO LOOK ABOUT ME AMONG THE VILE HAUNTS WHICH I NOW HABITUALLY FREQUENTED FOR ANOTHER PET OF THE SAME SPECIES AND OF SOMEWHAT SIMILAR APPEARANCE WITH WHICH TO SUPPLY ITS PLACE
THROUGH THESE LOW HILLS A WINDING ROAD LED ON A ROAD WHOSE END NO MAN HAD EVER REACHED BUT WHICH WENT TO PLACES WHERE NO DOUBT MANY WONDERS WERE
HOW MANY OF THE HOUNDS HE MANGLED I REMEMBER AND THE GIANT BEAR IT WAS A GOOD FIGHT HE MADE PERHAPS DANGEROUS HAD THE OLD RIFLE THERE BEEN LESS SURE YES YES OF COURSE I COULD RECALL EACH INCIDENT
THEY BROUGHT FORTH TO VIEW IN ALTERNATE ECLIPSE AND DEFINITION THE GREAT GRIM BEAR'S HEAD WHICH HUNG ABOVE THE MANTEL EVERY TROPHY GATHERED IN YEARS OF THE CHASE ONCE PERHAPS PRIZED NOW PERHAPS FORGOTTEN
FOR MONTHS I COULD NOT RID MYSELF OF THE PHANTASM OF THE CAT AND DURING THIS PERIOD THERE CAME BACK INTO MY SPIRIT A HALF SENTIMENT THAT SEEMED BUT WAS NOT REMORSE I WENT SO FAR AS TO REGRET THE LOSS OF THE ANIMAL
I THINK HE RIDES TO BATTLE WITH THE ROSE KNOWING WHAT FATE WILL COME YOU KNOW OF THIS BITING WHISTLE IN THE AIR THIS SMALL THING THAT SMITES UNSEEN
HUNG IT WITH THE TEARS STREAMING FROM MY EYES AND WITH THE BITTEREST REMORSE AT MY HEART HUNG IT BECAUSE I KNEW IT HAD LOVED ME AND BECAUSE I FELT IT HAD GIVEN ME NO REASON OF OFFENCE
IT WAS NO MATTER ABOUT THE SUN THIS WAS THE VALLEY OF AJALON PERHAPS OF WHICH ONE HAD HEARD IN THE CLASS AT SABBATH SCHOOL AND SURELY THIS WAS A GOOD DRONING YELLOW BODIED BEE
AND AT LENGTH EVEN PLUTO WHO WAS NOW BECOMING OLD AND CONSEQUENTLY SOMEWHAT PEEVISH EVEN PLUTO BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE THE EFFECTS OF MY ILL TEMPER ONE NIGHT RETURNING HOME MUCH INTOXICATED FROM ONE OF MY HAUNTS ABOUT TOWN
DO YOU HEAR HIM SIGH AND WHAT IS THIS HE WHISPERS HERE AT THE END OF THE LONG AND NARROWING WAY
SO SPAKE THE GOOD OLD SAVAGERY OF THE NATURAL MAN BETTER FOR THIS CREATURE HAD IT NEVER DISTURBED THESE TWO WITH ITS FOOTFALLS APPROACHING AMONG THE LEAVES OUT OF ITS REFUGE NOW MUST IT COME YEA THOUGH ONE LOST A THOUSAND SUPPERS THAT NIGHT
FOR A MOMENT ALMOST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE ROSE STIRRED DEEP DOWN AMONG ITS PETALS
THIS LATTER WAS A REMARKABLY LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL ENTIRELY BLACK AND SAGACIOUS TO AN ASTONISHING DEGREE IN SPEAKING OF HIS INTELLIGENCE MY WIFE WHO AT HEART WAS NOT A LITTLE TINCTURED WITH SUPERSTITION
AND IT IS ALL HERE ARE THOSE WHO RIDE AGAINST THOSE WHO SLAY DO YOU KNOW THIS ONE WHO RIDES AT THE HEAD SMILING SWINGING HIS SWORD WELL AND SMILING ALL THE TIME
IT PLUCKED THE LEAF WHICH MADE A BUCKLER FOR ITS SMALL THROBBING BREAST IT SPOKE THE ROSE IS BOLD AND RED SAID THE SINGING MOUSE BLOOD IS RED A SKULL IS WHITE
OBSERVING MY PARTIALITY FOR DOMESTIC PETS SHE LOST NO OPPORTUNITY OF PROCURING THOSE OF THE MOST AGREEABLE KIND WE HAD BIRDS GOLD FISH A FINE DOG RABBITS A SMALL MONKEY AND A CAT
I GREW DAY BY DAY MORE MOODY MORE IRRITABLE MORE REGARDLESS OF THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS I SUFFERED MYSELF TO USE INTEMPERATE LANGUAGE TO MY WIFE AT LENGTH I EVEN OFFERED HER PERSONAL VIOLENCE
AND BITTEN FINGERS AND TEARS BUT AFTER ALL WAS OVER THERE LAY THE SQUIRREL VANQUISHED AT THE FEET OF THESE YOUNG BARBARIANS WHO HAD WANDERED OUT FROM HOME INTO THE UNKNOWN LANDS OF EARTH CRUEL BARBARIANS THOUGHTLESS RELENTLESS
I SAW NOT THE LURCHING GALLOP OF THE LONG JAWED WOLF NOR THE HIGH ELASTIC BOUNDING OF THE DEER THE LEVEL SWINGING SPEED OF THE ANTELOPE THE SLINKING OF THE LYNX THE CRASHING FLIGHT OF THE WAPITI
THE SOUL EXULTS FLICKERING OF LIGHT ON STEEL THE FLASH OF SERVANT FORCES USED TO SLAY THE REVERBERANT GROWL OF ENGINES MADE FOR DEATH THE PASSING OF MEN IN CLOTH AND MEN IN BLANKETS
BUT HE NO LONGER APPEARED TO SUFFER ANY PAIN HE WENT ABOUT THE HOUSE AS USUAL BUT AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FLED IN EXTREME TERROR AT MY APPROACH I HAD SO MUCH OF MY OLD HEART LEFT AS TO BE AT FIRST GRIEVED BY THIS EVIDENT DISLIKE ON THE PART OF A CREATURE
THROUGH BRIERS AND FLOWERS THROUGH HINDRANCES AND RECOMPENSES ALONG THIS CROOKED WINDING UNKNOWN ROAD WHICH LED ON OUT INTO THE UNKNOWN THEY WANDERED
THIS PECULIARITY OF CHARACTER GREW WITH MY GROWTH AND IN MY MANHOOD I DERIVED FROM IT ONE OF MY PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF PLEASURE TO THOSE WHO HAVE CHERISHED AN AFFECTION FOR A FAITHFUL AND SAGACIOUS DOG
AND WITH SMALL HAZEL TREES WHICH SOON WOULD OFFER FRUIT FOR THE REGULAR HARVEST OF THE FALL THIS SAME TO BE SPREAD FOR DRYING ON THE WOODSHED ROOF IT WAS PERHAPS WISE CURIOSITY AS TO THE CROP OF NUTS WHICH HAD BROUGHT THUS FAR FROM HOME THESE TWO FIGURES
MANY EAGER EXPLANATIONS AND MUCH DESCRIPTIVE NARRATIVE SIMULTANEOUSLY UTTERED BY TWO MOUTHS EAGER BOTH TO EAT AND TO TALK I SEE IT ALL I SAID TO THE SINGING MOUSE IT ALL COMES BACK AGAIN
WHAT IS IT THIS SOUND APPROACHING COMING DIRECTLY TOWARD THE ROAD SURELY IT MUST BE THE FOOTFALL OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL THIS CADENCED RUSTLING ON THE LEAVES IT COMES IT WILL CROSS NEAR
MADE FREQUENT ALLUSION TO THE ANCIENT POPULAR NOTION WHICH REGARDED ALL BLACK CATS AS WITCHES IN DISGUISE NOT THAT SHE WAS EVER SERIOUS UPON THIS POINT AND I MENTION THE MATTER AT ALL FOR NO BETTER REASON THAN THAT IT HAPPENS JUST NOW TO BE REMEMBERED PLUTO
ONE KNEW NOT WHAT IT WAS THEREFORE WELL THAT THE YOUNGER BOY SHOULD CLASP TIGHTLY THE HAND OF THE OLDER HIM WHO BORE WITH SUCH CONFIDENCE THE BOW AND ARROWS
PLUTO HAD NOT A WHITE HAIR UPON ANY PORTION OF HIS BODY BUT THIS CAT HAD A LARGE ALTHOUGH INDEFINITE SPLOTCH OF WHITE COVERING NEARLY THE WHOLE REGION OF THE BREAST
HE SLEEPS IT IS ALL IT IS DONE IT IS THE WAY OF LIFE
YET THE CAWING OF A CROW ACROSS THE WOODS SEEMED FRIENDLY AND A SMALL BROWN BIRD WHICH HOPPED AHEAD ALONG THE ROAD WAS INTIMATE AND KIND AND THUS TOUCHED THE FOUNTS OF BRAVERY IN THE TWO VENTUROUS HEARTS CERTAINLY THEY WOULD GO ON
ITS EYES BRIGHT AND BLACK AND KEEN HAD IT NOT BEEN SAID THERE WERE WILD ANIMALS IN THESE WOODS EACH HEART NOW THUMPED HARD WITH THE SURGING BLOOD IT BORE
HIS TRAIL BECOMES NARROWER YET HE GOES BY SADDLE AND THE MOUNTAINS HEM HIM IN BUT NOW HE SMILES THE MORE NOW HE MUST LEAVE EVEN THE SADDLE AND THE TRAIL IS DIM AND HARD SEE
AND THOUGH A THOUSAND STONES LAY WAITING IN THE DARK ALONG THE ROAD TO HURT BARE UNPROTECTED TOES THE SUN FORGOT ITS PART AND SANK RED THOUGH RELUCTANT BEYOND THE DELECTABLE MOUNTAINS THOU MOON THIS IS AJALON
THIS EXCEPTION WAS FOUND IN A COMPARTMENT WALL NOT VERY THICK WHICH STOOD ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE AND AGAINST WHICH HAD RESTED THE HEAD OF MY BED THE PLASTERING HAD HERE IN GREAT MEASURE RESISTED THE ACTION OF THE FIRE
FROM MY INFANCY I WAS NOTED FOR THE DOCILITY AND HUMANITY OF MY DISPOSITION MY TENDERNESS OF HEART WAS EVEN SO CONSPICUOUS AS TO MAKE ME THE JEST OF MY COMPANIONS
I WAS AROUSED FROM SLEEP BY THE CRY OF FIRE THE CURTAINS OF MY BED WERE IN FLAMES THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS BLAZING IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT MY WIFE A SERVANT AND MYSELF MADE OUR ESCAPE FROM THE CONFLAGRATION
BUT HO THE CREATURE RALLIES RECOVERS IT GATHERS ITS FORCES IT FLIES PURSUIT THEN BUT PURSUIT APPARENTLY USELESS FOR THE ANIMAL HAS FOUND REFUGE DEEP IN THIS HOLLOW STUMP BEYOND THE REACH OF LONGEST MORTAL ARM
THE ROSE AND THE SKULL LOVE ONE ANOTHER THEY UNDERSTAND WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND AS I SAT BY THE SKULL I SAW A DREAM OF THE PAST GO BY IT WAS AS YOU SEE IT NOW
AND IF ONE BE FORTUNATE AND IF THIS SPLIT BESTRIDE THE TAIL OF THE CONCEALED ANIMAL AND IF THE STICK BE TWISTED I'VE GOT HIM CRIED THIS PHILOSOPHER FOR HIS EUREKA AND THEN THERE WAS TWISTING AND PULLING AND SCRATCHING AND SQUEAKING
I KNOW NOT IF IT BE THE END OR THE BEGINNING HE IS ALONE WITH NATURE AGAIN THE HEAVENS WEEP FOR HIM THE GRASSES AND LEAVES BEGIN WITH BUSY FINGERS TO COVER HIM UP THE EARTH PILLOWS HIM
ALWAYS THE ROSE IS THERE DO YOU SEE HIM LOOK UP AT THE MOUNTAINS ABOUT HIM AT THE TREES DO YOU SEE HIM LAY HIS HEAD UPON THE EARTH DO YOU STILL SEE HIS SMILE THE SMILE WHICH IS WEARY AND YET NOT AFRAID
FOR SO A WISE MAN ONCE HAD SAID HIS WORDS HARKENED TO WITH AWE THIS WAS A PLEASANT ROAD LINED WITH BRAVE SUMACS WITH BUSHES OF THE WILD BLACKBERRY
MY IMMEDIATE PURPOSE IS TO PLACE BEFORE THE WORLD PLAINLY SUCCINCTLY AND WITHOUT COMMENT A SERIES OF MERE HOUSEHOLD EVENTS IN THEIR CONSEQUENCES THESE EVENTS HAVE TERRIFIED HAVE TORTURED HAVE DESTROYED ME
I FANCIED THAT THE CAT AVOIDED MY PRESENCE I SEIZED HIM WHEN IN HIS FRIGHT AT MY VIOLENCE HE INFLICTED A SLIGHT WOUND UPON MY HAND WITH HIS TEETH THE FURY OF A DEMON INSTANTLY POSSESSED ME I KNEW MYSELF NO LONGER
AN ENORMOUS DISTANCE PERHAPS AT LEAST A MILE BEYOND WHAT HERETOFORE HAD BEEN THE UTMOST LIMIT OF THEIR WANDERINGS IT WAS NOT PERHAPS SAFE TO VENTURE SO FAR THERE WERE KNOWN TO BE STRANGE CREATURES IN THESE WOODS
THE NOISES OF THE WOODS THRILLED THEM THE SUDDEN CLANGING NOTE OF THE JAY NEAR BY CAUSED THEM TO STOP HEART IN MOUTH FOR THE MOMENT STRANGE RUSTLINGS IN THE LEAVES MADE THEM CROSS THE ROAD AND STEP MORE QUICKLY
WHICH UNKNOWN TO ME HAD COME AND PLACED ITSELF UPON THE TABLE I KNOW AND IT CLIMBED UPON MY ARM WHICH LAY ACROSS THE TABLE
AS I MADE NO SCRUPLE OF MALTREATING THE RABBITS THE MONKEY OR EVEN THE DOG WHEN BY ACCIDENT OR THROUGH AFFECTION THEY CAME IN MY WAY BUT MY DISEASE GREW UPON ME FOR WHAT DISEASE IS LIKE ALCOHOL
MERELY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT TO BE SUCH THIS SPIRIT OF PERVERSENESS I SAY CAME TO MY FINAL OVERTHROW IT WAS THIS UNFATHOMABLE LONGING OF THE SOUL TO VEX ITSELF TO OFFER VIOLENCE TO ITS OWN NATURE
THE PREY IS STILL UNREACHED WHAT IS TO BE DONE THE ELDER HUNTER BETHINKS HIM OF A SOLUTION FOR THIS PROBLEM THE BROKEN BLADE WILL DO TO GNAW OFF THIS BOUGH AND IT WILL SERVE TO MAKE A SPLIT IN THE END OF IT
THERE IT HAS TURNED IT IS NEAR THE ROAD LOOK THERE IT IS A GREAT ANIMAL HALF THE LENGTH OF ONE'S ARM WITH BUSHY LONG RED TAIL ARCHED HIGH FOR EASIER RUNNING ITS GRAYISH COAT SHOWING IN THE BARS OF SUNLIGHT
NO CHASE WAS EVER OR WILL EVER BE SO GREAT AS THIS ONE BACK THERE NEAR THE DELECTABLE MOUNTAINS IN THOSE DAYS GONE BY THOSE INCOMPARABLE DAYS OF YOUTH
SINGULAR AND OTHER SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS EXCITED MY CURIOSITY
NO LONGER CAN YE STRIKE TERROR INTO THESE TWO SOULS SMALL THOUGH THEY BE THE HEART OF THE HUNTER HAS NOW BEEN BORN FOR EACH FEAR AND DEFEAT ARE KNOWN NO LONGER IN THE COMPASS OF THEIR THOUGHTS FOLLOW FOLLOW FOLLOW
HE LOVED HE THOUGHT HE KNEW HE IS NOT DEAD HE IS WITH NATURE IT IS BUT THE BEGINNING LET THE ROSE PRESS AGAINST HIS LIPS IN AN ETERNAL PURE CARESS THERE IS NO END
YET I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO EXPOUND THEM TO ME THEY PRESENTED LITTLE BUT HORROR TO MANY THEY WILL SEEM LESS TERRIBLE THAN BAROQUES HEREAFTER PERHAPS SOME INTELLECT MAY BE FOUND WHICH WILL REDUCE MY PHANTASM TO THE COMMONPLACE
THE SINGING MOUSE BALANCED AND MOVED ITSELF IN HARMONY WITH THE BEAT OF THE FIRE'S RAYS I LOOKED AT IT SO CLOSELY THAT A DREAM CAME UPON MY EYES SO THAT THE VOICE OF THE SINGING MOUSE SOUNDED FAR AWAY AND FAINT
GRASPED THE POOR BEAST BY THE THROAT AND DELIBERATELY CUT ONE OF ITS EYES FROM THE SOCKET I BLUSH I BURN I SHUDDER WHILE I PEN THE DAMNABLE ATROCITY WHEN REASON RETURNED WITH THE MORNING
THE FIRE SHONE FAIR UPON ITS LITTLE FORM SO THAT IN SILHOUETTE ITS OUTLINE WAS DELICATE AND KEEN AS AN IMAGE CUT FROM THE FIERY HEART OF A NOBLE OPAL STONE AND WHAT IS IT THAT YOU KNOW I ASKED MAKER OF DREAMS TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW TO NIGHT
YET I AM NOT MORE SURE THAT MY SOUL LIVES THAN I AM THAT PERVERSENESS IS ONE OF THE PRIMITIVE IMPULSES OF THE HUMAN HEART ONE OF THE INDIVISIBLE PRIMARY FACULTIES OR SENTIMENTS WHICH GAVE DIRECTION TO THE CHARACTER OF MAN
OUR FRIENDSHIP LASTED IN THIS MANNER FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH MY GENERAL TEMPERAMENT AND CHARACTER THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE FIEND INTEMPERANCE HAD I BLUSH TO CONFESS IT EXPERIENCED A RADICAL ALTERATION FOR THE WORSE
THE TRAIL IS GONE HERE WHERE NO FOOT HAS TROD WHERE THE MOUNTAINS CLOSE ABOUT WHERE THE TREES WHISPER HE SITS AND LOOKS ABOUT HIM DO YOU SEE THE RED ROSE ON HIS BREAST
BUT THE SILENT FATHER STANDING BACK OF HER IN THE GLOW OF THE LAMPLIGHT SEES WHAT THE POLE IS BEARING AND IN HIS EYE THERE IS A SMILE AFTER THAT MOTHERLY REPROACH FATHERLY INQUIRY PLENTEOUS BREAD AND MILK
BY SOME ONE OF WHOM THE ANIMAL MUST HAVE BEEN CUT FROM THE TREE AND THROWN THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW INTO MY CHAMBER THIS HAD PROBABLY BEEN DONE WITH THE VIEW OF AROUSING ME FROM SLEEP
WHERE DID THE BEES GO TO WHEN THEY ROSE UP STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR AND THIS LITTLE MOUSE WHAT BECAME OF IT IN WINTER AND AH WHAT WAS THAT THAT AWFUL BURST OF SOUND
THE SINGING MOUSE PEEPED OUT FROM THE HOLLOW ORBIT OF THE WHITE SKULL WHICH LIES UPON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE VOLUME OF SHAKESPEARE IT REACHED DOWN A TINY PINK PAW AND TOUCHED A LEAF OF THE BRAVE RED ROSE WHICH EVERY DAY LIES BEFORE THE SKULL
ONE NIGHT AS I SAT HALF STUPEFIED IN A DEN OF MORE THAN INFAMY MY ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY DRAWN TO SOME BLACK OBJECT REPOSING UPON THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE IMMENSE HOGSHEADS OF GIN OR OF RUM
ALONG THIS MYSTERIOUS ROAD THROUGH THIS WILD AND UNKNOWN WILDERNESS SO FAR FROM ANY HABITATION OF MANKIND THE ZEAL OF THE EXPLORER HELD THEM FAST THEY SCARCE DARED FARE FARTHER ON BUT YET WOULD NOT TURN BACK
THE FALLING OF OTHER WALLS HAD COMPRESSED THE VICTIM OF MY CRUELTY INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE FRESHLY SPREAD PLASTER THE LIME OF WHICH WITH THE FLAMES AND THE AMMONIA FROM THE CARCASS HAD THEN ACCOMPLISHED THE PORTRAITURE AS I SAW IT
WAS BROUGHT INTO EVIDENCE NOR COULD ONE ESCAPE NOTING EACH ONE AND GIVING TO EACH FOR THIS ONE NIGHT MORE THE STORY WHICH BELONGED TO IT I SAT AND LOOKED UPON THEM ALL AND SO THERE PASSED A PANORAMA OF THE YEARS
CAT THE IMPRESSION WAS GIVEN WITH AN ACCURACY TRULY MARVELLOUS THERE WAS A ROPE ABOUT THE ANIMAL'S NECK WHEN I FIRST BEHELD THIS APPARITION FOR I COULD SCARCELY REGARD IT AS LESS MY WONDER AND MY TERROR WERE EXTREME
WELL DAVID YOU DON'T SEEM SATISFIED IS IT WITH MY CONDITION YOUR CONDITION NO NO NO IT'S NOT YOUR CONDITION YES YES FINE FINE I NEVER SAW SUCH A MARVELLOUS CHANGE IN MY LIFE NEVER
THAT I HAVE NEGLECTED HER MY OWN MOTHER I COULDN'T OPEN AND READ IT WITH THAT MAN'S EYES ON ME NO NO STAY HERE I BEG OF YOU STAY YOU ARE DIFFERENT I WANT YOU
HE HELD IT IN HIS SLENDER FINGERS AND EYED IT CRITICALLY HOW DID YOU COME TO TRY TO MAKE A PICTURE OF THE SEA WHEN YOU NEVER SAW IT DO KNOW
I WAS PLANNING IT OUT SLOWLY BUT THIS YOU SEE DOCTOR THEIR IDEAS ARE ALL WARPED OVER THERE THEY ACCEPT ALL THAT CUSTOM DECREES AND HAVE BUT THE ONE POINT OF VIEW
AND THEREFORE HAD NEVER DESIRED NOW GIVEN HIM BY SO CRUEL A BLOW HE WOULD NOT SHRINK FROM WHATEVER DUTY
OF COURSE THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING WE ALL DO WE MEN BUT WE DAMN IT ALL DO YOU SUPPOSE I'VE LIVED ALL THESE YEARS AND NOT SEEN WHY WE THINK OF OURSELVES FIRST EVERY TIME
DAVID SMILINGLY LOOKED ON HOW OFTEN HAD HE SEEN THE DELIGHTFUL OLD MAN AMUSE HIMSELF THUS WITH THE CHILDREN HE WOULD CONTORT HIS MOBILE FACE INTO ALL THE VARYING EXPRESSIONS OF WONDER AND DISMAY
TELL US WHAT THEY MEAN THIS'N HIT'S THE OCEAN AN THAT THAR
DAVID GLANCED AT THE YOUNG WOMAN INDICATED SHE WAS PLEASANT FACED AND ROSY AND LOOKED PRACTICAL AND GOOD HE'S SUCH AN ODD LITTLE CHAP SHE SAID WHAT BE THAT ODD DOES HIT MEAN THIS ER LUMP ON MY BACK
WHAT ARE THESE MOUNDS HERE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SEA THEM'S MOUNTAINS BUT WHY DID YOU PUT MOUNTAINS IN THE SEA THE BOY LOOKED WITH WIDE EYES DREAMILY PAST THE TWO MEN SO ATTENTIVELY REGARDING HIM I
FOR HER YES YES BUT YOUR UNCLE YOU KNOW DIED OF GRIEF AND YOUR M MOTHER I KNOW SO THE LAWYER SAID NOW AT LAST WE'LL READ MOTHER'S LETTER
THE DOCTOR'S VOICE BROKE THE SILENCE WITH SUDDEN IMPULSE IN THIS SHE SPEAKS AS IF SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE I TOLD YOU I HAD NEGLECTED HER CRIED DAVID CONTRITELY
AND ANY FLING AT HER SONS IS A BLOW TO HER BUT WHAT I SAY I COULDN'T TELL HER I TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN DRINKING FROM THE CUP OF HAPPINESS I HAVE DRAINED IT TO THE LAST DROP MY WIFE IS MINE
DOCTOR HOYLE YOU'LL ACCOMPANY US AT MY REQUEST UNDOUBTEDLY YOU ARE INTERESTED IN YOUR YOUNG FRIEND MECHANICALLY DAVID WALKED WITH THE TWO OLDER MEN FILLED WITH A STRANGE SINKING OF THE HEART AND AT THE SAME TIME WITH A VAGUE ELATION
WHEN YOU COMIN BACK BROTHAH DAVID DOES IT HURT YOU VERY MUCH HOYLE I RECKON HIT HAVE TO HURT SAID THE CHILD WITH FATALISTIC RESIGNATION I DON'T GUESS HE'D HURT ME THOUT HE HAD TO
HE OPENED HIS MOTHER'S LETTER AND SLOWLY READ IT THEN PASSED IT TO HIS FRIEND AND RISING WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD GAZING DOWN INTO THE SQUARE
EVERYTHING IT'S THE DESTINY OF WOMEN TO LOVE US THANK GOD SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DOOMED SURELY TO DIE IF SHE HAD MARRIED THE ONE WHO WANTED HER FIRST OR TO LIVE A LIFE FOR HER WORSE THAN DEATH OH LORD BLESS YOU BOY YES
BETTER THAN I COULD DAVID LIFTED HIS EYES TO HIS OLD FRIEND'S THEN TURNED THEM AWAY I FEEL HIM TO BE A SACRED TRUST AGAIN HE PAUSED IT WOULD TAKE A
DO YOU MEAN DEAD MY UNCLE DEAD AND I I HIS HEIR THE LAWYER REPLIED FORMALLY YOU ARE NOW THE HEAD OF A MOST ANCIENT AND HONORABLE HOUSE
HE PULLED DAVID DOWN AND WHISPERED THE QUESTION IN HIS EAR NO NO SHE ONLY MEANS THAT YOU'RE A DEAR QUEER LITTLE CHAP
BRUSHED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES AND CAUGHT UP A BATTERED SILK HAT HE TURNED IT ABOUT AND LOOKED AT IT RUEFULLY WITH A QUIZZICAL SMILE PLAYING ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES REMEMBER THAT HAT HE ASKED WELL DO I REMEMBER IT
OR CUT HIS COAT AFTER ANY PATTERN OTHER THAN THE ORDINARY CONVENTIONAL LINES EVEN THE BOYS ON THE STREET WILL FLING STONES AT HIM HER PATRONIZING FRIENDS WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST POLITELY RAISE THEIR EYEBROWS SHE IS PROUD AND SENSITIVE
THE LAWYER BEGAN A FEW CONGRATULATORY REMARKS BUT DAVID STOPPED HIM WITH UPLIFTED HAND IT IS CALAMITOUS IT IS TOO TERRIBLE HE SAID SADLY AND WHAT IT BRINGS MAY BE FAR MORE OF A BURDEN THAN A JOY
HE WONDERED I SUPPOSE THAT I DIDN'T LOOK AT IT WHEN HE GAVE IT TO ME BUT I FELT CONSCIENCE STRICKEN I'VE BEEN SO FILLED WITH MY LIFE DOWN THERE THE PEACE
BUT YOUR MOTHER DAVID TURNED AND WALKED TO THE TABLE AND SAT WITH HIS HEAD BOWED ON HIS ARMS HAD HE BEEN ALONE HE WOULD HAVE WEPT AS IT WAS HE SPOKE BROKENLY OF HIS OLD HOME
VERY OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO YOU OH NO NO I'M NOT THINKING OF ADAM BLESS YOU NO THE DOCTOR ALWAYS CALLED HIS LITTLE NAMESAKE ADAM I'M THINKING OF HER THE LITTLE GIRL YOU LEFT BEHIND YOU
I'VE KNOWN I'VE KNOWN CURIOUS BUT WHY HELLO
DAVID NEVER HEARD THE CLINKING OF GLASSES AND BOTTLES BORNE ON A TRAY WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S SICKENING SINKING OF THE HEART AND THE FOREBODING THAT SEEMED TO DRENCH HIM WITH DISMAY AS THE GLASSES WERE PLACED ON THE STAND AT MISTER STRETTON'S ELBOW
AND WALKED RAPIDLY AND RESTLESSLY ABOUT THE SMALL APARTMENT AND LAUGHED IN SYMPATHY IT'S NOT NOT I KNOW DAVID GREW INSTANTLY SOBER AGAIN OF COURSE THE LITTLE CHAP'S CASE IS SERIOUS
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IN WHICH DOCTOR HOYLE SPEAKS HIS MIND DOCTOR HOYLE SAT IN HIS OFFICE STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM NOT AS IF HE WERE LOOKING AT DAVID THRYNG WHO SAT IN RANGE OF HIS VISION
IT'S A WOMAN'S DESTINY I'M AN OLD FOOL THERE THERE'S MY OWN LITTLE GIRL SHE'S M MARRIED AND GONE GONE TO LIVE IN ENGLAND THEY WILL DO IT THE WOMEN WILL COME WE'LL GO SEE ADAM THE DOCTOR SPRANG UP

MISTER STRETTON DID NOT REPLY DIRECTLY BUT CONTINUED SMILING AS HIS MANNER WAS AND TURNED TOWARD DAVID'S COMPANION SHALL WE GO TO MY HOTEL I HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO TALK OVER BUSINESS WHICH CONCERNS
I FEAR YOU MISTAKE ME FOR MY COUSIN SIR SAID DAVID SMILING I HOPE YOU HAVE NO ILL NEWS FROM MY GOOD UNCLE BUT I AM NOT THE DAVID WHO INHERITS I THINK HE IS IN SOUTH AFRICA

WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO WITH ME RATHER I'LL GO BACK TO HER AS SOON AS I DARE LEAVE THE BOY
DAVID SMILED OVER THE OLD DOCTOR'S STAMMER OF ENTHUSIASM IT WAS AS IF HIS THOUGHTS FERTILE AND VEHEMENT AND THE FEELINGS OF HIS GREAT WARM HEART WELLED UP WITHIN HIM AND TRYING TO BURST FORTH ALL AT ONCE TUMBLED OVER THEMSELVES
I HAVE LEARNED OF HIM I BELIEVE HE WAS A MAN WHO WALKED WITH GOD AND AT CASSANDRA'S SIDE I HAVE TROD IN HIS SECRET PLACES THAT'S RIGHT I'M SATISFIED NOW ABOUT HER YOU'RE ALL RIGHT BUT
THEY WOULD ALL FLOCK TO HER AND PESTER HER WITH THEIR OUTCRY OF HOW VERY EXTRAORDINARY I CAN HEAR THEM AND SEE THEM NOW I TELL YOU IF A MAN STEPS OUT OF THE BEATEN TRACK OVER THERE IF HE ATTEMPTS TO ORDER HIS OWN LIFE MARRY TO PLEASE HIMSELF

WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY NOT BEEN UNPACKED BEFORE HE TRIED IT ON HIS HEAD TURNED IT ABOUT AND ABOUT TOOK IT OFF AND GAZED AT IT WITHIN AND WITHOUT THEN HASTILY TOSSED IT ASIDE AND SNATCHING HIS OLD ONE FROM DAVID PUT IT ON HIS HEAD AND THEY STARTED OFF

FROM THEIR BEDS LAUGHED OUT MERRILY AND STRAINED THEIR NECKS TO SEE THESE'RE THEIRN I MADE THIS'N FER HIM AN THIS'N FER HIM HE TOSSED THE PICTURES FEEBLY TOWARD THEM AND THEY FLUTTERED TO THE FLOOR
THROWING DANCING FLECKS OF LIGHT AND THE WINE IN THEM WHY DID IT MAKE HIM THINK OF BLOOD WERE THEY DEAD THEN ALL THREE HIS TWO COUSINS AND HIS BROTHER DEAD SHOT
HAD HE EVER SEEN THE MAN BEFORE HE REALLY DID NOT KNOW THEY REACHED THE HOTEL SHORTLY AND WERE CONDUCTED TO MISTER STRETTON'S PRIVATE APARTMENT WHERE WINE WAS ORDERED AND PROMPTLY SERVED FOR YEARS THEREAFTER
THAT THE REASON I CANNOT TAKE HER WITH ME NOW IS THAT OUR GREAT FRIENDS OVER THERE ARE TOO SMALL TO UNDERSTAND HER NATURE AND MIGHT DESPISE HER I MUST GO TO MY MOTHER FIRST AND FEEL MY WAY SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
I KNOW YOU MUST GO TO YOUR MOTHER YES I MUST GO TO HER OF COURSE OF COURSE AND WITHOUT DELAY WELL I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE LITTLE CHAP I KNOW YOU WILL
HOYLE HAD BEEN PLACED IN A SMALL WARD WHERE WERE ONLY TWO OTHER LITTLE BEDS BOTH OCCUPIED WITH ONE NURSE TO ATTEND ON THE THREE PATIENTS ONE OF THEM HAD BROKEN HIS LEG AND HAD TO LIE IN A CAST AND THE OTHER
AT LAST IT WAS DECIDED THAT HE SHOULD SAIL FOR ENGLAND WITHOUT DELAY TAKING THE PASSAGE ALREADY PROVISIONALLY ENGAGED FOR HIM BY MISTER STRETTON I CAN WRITE TO CASSANDRA SHE WILL UNDERSTAND MORE EASILY THAN MY MOTHER
YES YES OF HER SHE'S NOT SO LITTLE NOW DOCTOR SHE'S TALL TALL ENOUGH TO BE BEAUTIFUL I REMEMBER HER SLIGHT SLIGHT LITTLE CREATURE
BUT THE NAME MY LORD THE ANCIENT AND HONORABLE LINEAGE THAT LAST WAS ALREADY MINE AND FOR THE TITLE I HAVE NEVER COVETED IT
AND IT TAKES SOME TIME TO GET WONTED TO A NEW ONE HE GRAVELY LAID THE OLD ONE WITHIN EASY REACH OF HIS ARM AND RESTORED THE NEW ONE TO ITS BOX THEN HE SAT HIMSELF NEAR DAVID AND PLACED HIS HAND KINDLY ON HIS KNEE

UNTIL I CAME DOWN TO THE BEGINNINGS OF THINGS WITH THEM HER HER FATHER WHY HE'S DEAD HE
AND OCCUPY THE HOME OF YOUR ANCESTORS HE TOOK UP ONE OF THE PAPERS AND ADJUSTED HIS MONOCLE FOR A TIME DAVID DID NOT SPEAK AT LAST HE ROSE AND WITH HEAD ERECT EXTENDED HIS HAND TO THE LAWYER
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT DO ABOUT IT I MEANT TO KEEP HER TO MYSELF UNTIL THE RIGHT TIME CAME PERHAPS IN ANOTHER YEAR BRING HER HERE AND BEGIN LIFE IN A MODEST WAY AND LET MY MOTHER VISIT US AND SEE FOR HERSELF
BUT BOTH WERE WELL ENOUGH TO BE COMPANIONABLE WITH THE LONELY LITTLE SOUTHERNER HOYLE'S FACE BEAMED UPON DAVID AS HE BENT OVER HIM I KIN MAKE PI'CHERS WHILST I'M A LYIN HERE

THE DOCTOR TURNED THE PAPER OVER AND REGARDED IT A MOMENT SHOW ME THE WINDOW I I SEE NO WINDOW ON THE OTHER SIDE AGAIN THE THREE LITTLE INVALIDS LAUGHED UPROARIOUSLY AT THEIR VISITOR
OF TERROR OR STUPEFACTION AND HIS ENTRANCE TO THE CHILDREN'S WARD WAS ALWAYS GREETED WITH OUTCRIES OF DELIGHT WHEN THE LITTLE ONES WERE WELL ENOUGH TO ALLOW OF SUCH FREEDOM HAVEN'T YOU ONE TO SEND TO YOUR SISTER

HE COULD THINK ONLY OF HIS MOTHER HE SAW HER FACE AGED AND GRIEF STRICKEN HE KNEW HOW SHE LOVED THE BOY SHE HAD LOST ABOVE ALL AND NOW SHE MUST TURN TO HIMSELF
THE DOCTOR TOOK THE PAPER AND REGARDED IT GRAVELY A MOMENT THEN LIFTED HIS EYEBROWS AND MADE GRIMACES OF WONDERMENT UNTIL THE THREE PATIENTS IN THE THREE LITTLE BEDS WERE IN GALES OF LAUGHTER AT LAST HE SAID
LONG TIME TO GO TO HER FIRST TO HER FOR THE INSTANT THE OLD MAN HAD FORGOTTEN CASSANDRA NOT SO DAVID MY WIFE IT WILL BE DESPERATELY HARD

THREE DAYS PASSED ON THE FOURTH MARCELLA RETURNED LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FROM A ROUND OF PARISH VISITS WITH MARY HARDEN AS SHE OPENED THE OAK DOORS WHICH SHUT OFF THE CENTRAL HALL OF MELLOR FROM THE OUTER VESTIBULE
HER WAVERING EYE SEEMED TO INTERROGATE HER COMPANION MARCELLA WAS PUZZLED BY HER MANNER IT WAS SO FAR FROM SIMPLE BUT THAT WAS LONG AGO SURELY SHE SAID YES IT WOR LONG AGO BUT YOU DON'T FORGET THEM THINGS MISS
HE CARRIED HIM IN TO THE FIRE AND SAT HIM ON HIS KNEES THE LITTLE EMACIATED CREATURE FLUSHED WITH THE PLEASURE OF HIS FATHER'S COMPANY PLAYED CONTENTEDLY IN THE INTERVALS OF COUGHING WITH THE SHINING CHESTNUTS OR ATE HIS SLICE OF THE FINE PEAR
IN YOUR INTERESTS AS WELL AS MINE YOU WILL MAKE ALL THE GREATER IMPRESSION MY DEAR FOR I HAVE REALLY FORGOTTEN HOW TO BEHAVE THOSE CARDS SHALL BE PROPERLY RETURNED OF COURSE FOR THE REST LET NO ONE DISTURB THEMSELVES TILL THEY MUST
THE KEEPER BIG BURLY PROSPEROUS WOULD SPEAK TO HIM WITH INSOLENT PATRONAGE WATCHING HIM ALL THE TIME OR WITH THE OLD BRUTALITY WHICH HURD DARED NOT RESENT ONLY IN HIS EXCITABLE DWARF'S SENSE
I THOUGHT PRAPS YOU'D BETTER KNOW HER EXCLAMATION OF TERROR HER WILD LOOK AT HIM WERE EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD EXPECTED NEVERTHELESS HE FLINCHED BEFORE THEM HIS BRUTALITY WAS MOSTLY ASSUMED
SO TAKE IT QUIETLY SAYS HE HE HAD YOUNG DYNES WITH HIM SO I DIDN'T SAY NOUGHT I KEP AS STILL AS A MOUSE
BUT MINTA WAS SORE AFRAID AND WENT ON TALKING AND LAMENTING WHILE SHE MADE THE TEA HE TOOK LITTLE HEED OF HER HE SAT BY THE FIRE QUIVERING AND THINKING
BECAUSE OF A LIE GEORGE TOLD IM THE POOR CHAP LAY IN A DITCH UNDER DISLEY WOOD ALL DAY BECAUSE HE WAS THAT KNOCKED ABOUT HE COULDN'T WALK AND AT NIGHT HE CRAWLED HOME ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES HE'S SHOWN ME THE PLACE MANY A TIME
AGAINST HER WILL SHE REDDENED A LITTLE BUT SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO HELP THROWING OUT THE PROMISE
FOR THEY WERE ALWAYS WELL THUMBED BEFORE THEY CAME BACK TO HER BUT TO NIGHT HIS SULLEN WEARINESS WOULD MAKE NO EFFORT AND THE HUNTED RESTLESS GLANCES HE THREW FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS HE SAT CROUCHING OVER THE FIRE THE LARGE MOUTH TIGHT SHUT
SAID MISSUS JELLISON SHARPLY TO HER AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD OF TEN THAT YOU DON'T SAY GOOD EVENIN TO THE YOUNG LADY MISSUS WESTALL CURTSIED LOW AND HOPED SHE MIGHT BE EXCUSED AS IT HAD GROWN SO DARK
WITH DESIGNS ON THE HEAD KEEPER'S POST WHENEVER IT MIGHT BE VACANT IN THE CASE OF A POACHER HE HAD THE SCENT OF ONE OF HIS OWN HARES IT WAS KNOWN TO HIM IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME THAT THAT LOW CASELTY FELLOW HURD
AND FELL INTO A CHAIR BY THE GRATE HE HAD HARDLY GREETED MARCELLA WHO HAD CERTAINLY LOOKED TO BE GREETED EVER SINCE HER ARRIVAL IN AUGUST AS SHE HAD TOLD ALDOUS RAEBURN SHE HAD TAKEN A WARM INTEREST IN THIS MAN
AND IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION TO MISSUS BOYCE AND HER DAUGHTER TO TAKE LUNCHEON AT THE COURT ON THE FOLLOWING FRIDAY THE NOTE WAS COURTEOUSLY AND KINDLY WORDED WE SHOULD BE SO GLAD SAID THE WRITER
ON THE STRANGE CELTIC FACE AND MATTED HAIR OF THE DWARF FAMILY AFFECTION AND THE SATISFACTION OF THE SIMPLER PHYSICAL NEEDS THESE THINGS MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF THE POOR FOR THIS HOUR TO NIGHT
YOU TAKE GREAT INTEREST IN YOUR BOYCE BELONGINGS I PERCEIVE YOU MAY REMEMBER TOO PERHAPS THAT THERE IS OTHER BLOOD IN YOU AND THAT NO MERRITT HAS EVER SUBMITTED QUIETLY TO EITHER PATRONAGE OR PITY MARCELLA STARTED
AND NOW AFTER SEVEN MONTHS OF REGULAR FIELD WORK AND RESPECTABLE LIVING IT WAS ALL TO BEGIN AGAIN WITH THE NEW WINTER THE SAME SHUDDERS AND TERRORS THE SAME SHAMES BEFORE THE GENTRY AND MISTER HARDEN THE SOFT TIMID WOMAN WITH HER CONSCIENCE
SHE SOON DISCOVERED OR IMAGINED THAT HURD HAD MORE EDUCATION THAN HIS NEIGHBOURS AT ANY RATE HE WOULD SIT LISTENING TO HER AND SMOKING AS SHE MADE HIM DO WHILE SHE TALKED POLITICS AND SOCIALISM TO HIM
AND IF I WERE YOU MARCELLA I WOULD HARDLY DISCUSS THE FAMILY AFFAIRS ANY MORE WITH MISTER RAEBURN OR ANYBODY ELSE AND AGAIN HER KEEN GLANCE DISCONCERTED THE TALL HANDSOME GIRL WHOSE POWER OVER THE WORLD ABOUT HER HAD NEVER EXTENDED TO HER MOTHER
ON THE MELLOR LAND WOULD THE WIFE AND MOTHER EVER FORGET THE PURE ANIMAL SATISFACTION OF THAT MEAL OR THE FEARFUL JOY OF THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN HE GOT THREE SHILLINGS FROM A LOCAL PUBLICAN FOR A HARE AND TWO RABBITS
IF YOU HAVE CHOSEN YOUR LINE AND WISH TO MAKE FRIENDS HERE VERY WELL I WILL DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU SO LONG AS YOU DO NOT EXPECT ME TO CHANGE MY LIFE FOR WHICH MY DEAR I AM GROWN TOO CROTCHETY AND TOO OLD MARCELLA LOOKED AT HER WITH DISMAY
AND TAKING UP A BIT OF HALF BURNT WOOD WHICH LAY ON THE HEARTH HE THREW IT VIOLENTLY BACK INTO THE GRATE MARCELLA LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WITH SURPRISE MISSUS HURD'S EXPRESSION WAS ONE OF MISERABLE DISCOMFORT
BUT HIS MOTHER SHE WAS A QUEER MAD BODY WITH RED HAIR JUST LIKE JIM AND THE CHILDREN AND A TEMPER MY WORD THEY DO SAY SHE WAS AN IRISH GIRL OUT OF A GANG AS USED TO WORK NEAR HERE AN SHE LET HIM DROP ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS IN LIQUOR
THERE WAS A DIGNITY ABOUT HER MOTHER'S LIGHTEST ACTION ABOUT EVERY MOVEMENT OF HER SLENDER FINGERS AND FINE FAIR HEAD WHICH HAD ALWAYS HELD THE DAUGHTER IN CHECK EVEN WHILE SHE REBELLED MISSUS BOYCE READ IT AND THEN HANDED IT TO MARCELLA
MARCELLA FLUSHED AND PLAYED WITH THE FIRE YOU SEE MAMMA SHE SAID AFTER A MOMENT STILL LOOKING AT THE LOGS AND THE SHOWER OF SPARKS THEY MADE AS SHE MOVED THEM ABOUT YOU NEVER LET ME DISCUSS THEM WITH YOU HEAVEN FORBID
BUT AFTER THE FIRST RELIEF MINTA HAD GONE IN FEAR AND TREMBLING FOR THE OLD WOODCRAFT REVIVED IN HURD AND THE OLD PASSION FOR THE FIELDS AND THEIR CHANCES
AND YOU WILL SEE IF YOU SO CHOOSE IT THAT THERE WILL BE NOTHING UNSURMOUNTABLE IN YOUR WAY ONE PIECE OF ADVICE LET ME GIVE YOU DON'T BE TOO GRATEFUL TO MISS RAEBURN OR ANYBODY ELSE
MISSUS JELLISON GRUMBLED GIBED AT HER AND MADE LONG LEAVE TAKINGS WHILE THE DAUGHTER STOOD SILENT WAITING AND EVERY NOW AND THEN PEERING AT MARCELLA WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE I DON KNOW WHERE YUR MANNERS IS
WAS ATTACKING HIS GAME HURD NOTWITHSTANDING WAS CUNNING ITSELF AND WESTALL LAY IN WAIT FOR HIM IN VAIN MEANWHILE ALL THE OLD HATRED BETWEEN THE TWO MEN REVIVED
AND WANTED A LOCAL WATCHER AND ACCOMPLICE HE HAD THOUGHT THE MATTER AT FIRST TOO DANGEROUS TO TOUCH MOREOVER HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN A PERIOD OF TRANSITION PESTERED BY MINTA TO GIVE UP THE POACHIN AND YET DRAWN BACK TO IT AFTER HIS SPRING AND SUMMER OF FIELD WORK
IN A PUBLIC HOUSE TWO NIGHTS BEFORE THIS ONE OVERTURES HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM ON BEHALF OF A WELL KNOWN GANG OF POACHERS WITH HEAD QUARTERS IN A NEIGHBOURING COUNTY TOWN WHO HAD THEIR EYES ON THE PHEASANT PRESERVES IN WESTALL'S PARTICULAR BEAT THE TUDLEY END BEAT
VERY SOON HE WAS NO LONGER CONTENT WITH MELLOR WHERE SINCE THE DEATH OF YOUNG HAROLD THE HEIR THE KEEPERS HAD BEEN DISMISSED AND WHAT REMAINED OF A ONCE NUMEROUS HEAD OF GAME LAY OPEN TO THE WILES OF ALL THE BOLD SPIRITS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
YOU'RE GOIN TO PUT THAT BIT OF HARE ON WELL MAK EEASTE DO FOR I'M STARVIN WHAT DID SHE WANT TO STAY ALL THAT TIME FOR YOU GO AND GET IT I'LL BLOW THE FIRE UP DAMN THESE STICKS
CAN'T YOU AS JIM DON'T WANT TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WESTALL THANK YOU KINDLY ALL THE SAME SHE ADDED BREAKING OFF HER NARRATIVE WITH THE SAME UNCERTAINTY OF MANNER THE SAME TIMID SCRUTINY OF HER VISITOR THAT MARCELLA HAD NOTICED BEFORE
SHUT OFF FROM EVERYBODY JOINING WITH NOBODY WITH NO FRIENDLY FEELINGS OR SOCIETY IT WAS BAD ENOUGH IN THE OLD LODGING HOUSE DAYS BUT HERE WHY SHOULD WE MISSUS BOYCE HAD CERTAINLY GROWN PALE
TRYING WITH SHORTSIGHTED EYES TO DISTINGUISH HER DAUGHTER AMONG THE SHADOWS OF THE GREAT BARE PLACE A DARK DAY WAS DRAWING TO ITS CLOSE
AN THE LOW WAGES HE'D GET AN OF NOT BEIN STRONG MYSELF BUT ONE DAY I WAS GOING UP A LANE INTO TUDLEY END WOODS AN I HEARD GEORGE WESTALL ON TOTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE WITH A YOUNG DOG HE WAS TRAINING
FOR THE SAKE OF GIVING EMPLOYMENT BUT THEIR OWN MEN ON THE ESTATE WOULD COME FIRST AND THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM OUT OF WORK WELL BUT THERE IS THE GAME PERSISTED MARCELLA
LEANING AGAINST THE BARE SHELVES WHICH HELD THEIR FEW POTS AND PANS SHE THREW HER APRON OVER HER HEAD AND BURST INTO THE FORLORNEST WEEPING I WISH I WAS DEAD I WISH I WAS DEAD AN THE CHILLEN TOO
THE NOSTRILS WORKING SHOWED HER THAT HE WOULD BE GLAD WHEN SHE WENT AWAY HER YOUNG EXACTING TEMPER WAS PIQUED SHE HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME TRYING TO ARRANGE THEIR LIVES FOR THEM SO IN SPITE OF HIS DUMB RESISTANCE SHE LINGERED ON
WITH HIS DEFORMITY HIS EARTH STAINS HIS BLUE EYES HIS BROWN WRINKLED SKIN AND HIS SHOCK OF RED HAIR HE HAD THE LOOK OF SOME STRANGE GNOME CROUCHING THERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE AT I'LL SWEAR HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE
AND SHE KEPT TWISTING HER APRON IN HER GNARLED HANDS YES I SHALL
ON THE THRESHOLD STOOD MISSUS JELLISON'S DAUGHTER MISSUS WESTALL WITH HER LITTLE BOY BESIDE HER THE WOMAN'S BROAD SHOULDERS AND HARSH STRIKING HEAD STANDING OUT AGAINST THE PALE SKY BEHIND
HE MUST NEEDS GO ON TO THOSE WOODS OF LORD MAXWELL'S WHICH GIRDLED THE MELLOR ESTATE ON THREE SIDES AND HERE HE CAME ONCE MORE ACROSS HIS ENEMY FOR GEORGE WESTALL WAS NOW IN THE FAR BETTER PAID SERVICE OF THE COURT AND A VERY CLEVER KEEPER
AN WESTALL HE'S JUST THE SAME SORT AS HE WAS THEN SO FOLKS SAY SHE ADDED HURRIEDLY YOU SEE JIM MISS HOW HE'S MADE HIS BACK WAS TWISTED THAT WAY WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE UN HIS FATHER WAS A GOOD OLD MAN EVERYBODY SPOKE WELL OF IM

MEANWHILE IN THE LANE OUTSIDE MARCELLA AS SHE WALKED HOME PASSED A TALL BROAD SHOULDERED MAN IN A VELVETEEN SUIT AND GAITERS HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND TWO DOGS BEHIND HIM
BUT HE CAUGHT ME LOOKIN AT A SNARE THIS MORNIN' IT WOR MISTY AND I DIDN'T SEE NO ONE COMIN IT WOR CLOSE TO THE FOOTPATH AND IT WORN'T MY SNARE JIM MY CHAP SAYS HE MOCKIN I'M SORRY FOR IT BUT I'M GOING TO SEARCH YER
A LACKADAISICAL SILLY WOMAN HAD GIVEN HER HER FINE NAME BY WAY OF ADDITIONAL PROOF THAT SHE AND HER CHILDREN WERE SOMETHING OUT OF THE COMMON MOREOVER SHE HAD THE CONFORMING LAW ABIDING INSTINCTS OF THE WELL TREATED DOMESTIC SERVANT
AN OFF I WALKED DON'T YOU BE AFEARED
TO SHOW YOU AND MISS BOYCE OUR BEAUTIFUL WOODS WHILE THEY ARE STILL AT THEIR BEST IN THE WAY OF AUTUMN COLOUR HOW WILL MAMMA TAKE IT THOUGHT MARCELLA ANXIOUSLY THERE IS NOT A WORD OF PAPA WHEN SHE ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM
SAID MISSUS BOYCE QUICKLY THEN AFTER A PAUSE
BUT THE QUESTION WITH ME HAS ALWAYS BEEN SHALL I ACCEPT PITY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO MEET IT WITH A NO YOU ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM ME BUT FOR YOU ALSO I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST ANSWER
THAT WE WON'T TAKE THEIR HANDS WHEN THEY STRETCH THEM OUT WHEN THEY WRITE SO KINDLY AND NICELY AS THIS AND SHE LAID HER FINGERS ALMOST PITEOUSLY ON THE NOTE UPON HER KNEE MISSUS BOYCE TILTED THE SILVER URN
AND HALF THE ABLE BODIED MEN OF MELLOR HAD TRAMPED UP INTO THE SMOKE AS THE VILLAGE PUT IT IN SEARCH OF LONDON WORK THEN OUT OF ACTUAL SHEER STARVATION THAT VERY RARE EXCUSE OF THE POACHER HURD HAD GONE ONE NIGHT AND SNARED A HARE
SHE SAW SOMETHING WHITE LYING ON THE OLD CUT AND DISUSED BILLIARD TABLE WHICH STILL OCCUPIED THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR TILL RICHARD BOYCE IN THE COURSE OF HIS ECONOMIES AND IMPROVEMENTS COULD REPLACE IT BY A NEW ONE SHE RAN FORWARD AND TOOK UP A SHEAF OF CARDS
WHERE UD YOU AN THE CHILLEN BE THIS NIGHT IF I ADN'T DONE IT ADN'T WE GOT RID OF EVERY STICK O STUFF WE IVER AD ERE'S A WELL FURNISHED PLACE FOR A CHAP TO SIT IN HE GLANCED BITTERLY ROUND THE BARE KITCHEN WHICH HAD NONE OF THE LITTLE PROPERTIES OF THE COUNTRY POOR

TURNING THEM OVER IN A SMILING EXCITEMENT
THE LOOK OF SUFFERING FOR AN INSTANT WAS UNMISTAKABLE THEN SHE STARTED AT THE SOUND OF MARCELLA'S STEP AND PUT DOWN THE CADDY AMID THE DELICATE CHINA CROWDED ON THE TRAY WITH ALL THE QUIET PRECISION OF HER ORDINARY MANNER
HURD DRANK THIS WINTER MORE THAN HE HAD EVER DRUNK YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO KEEP ON GOOD TERMS WITH ONE OR TWO PUBLICANS WHO ACTED AS RECEIVERS OF THE POACHED GAME OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT WESTALL PURSUED HIM INTO THESE LOW DENS
BUT HE'LL NOT FIND IT MISS HE'LL NOT FIND IT SHE SAID TWISTING HER HANDS IN A SORT OF RESTLESS MISERY
SHE HAD THE AIR OF PROTECTING AND GUIDING THIS POVERTY THAT COULD NOT HELP ITSELF THE MOTHER AND WIFE FELT HERSELF SHY INTIMIDATED THE TEARS CAME BACK TO HER BROWN EYES WHEN MISS BOYCE HAD GONE
HURD LIFTED THE BOY IN HIS ARM WHERE YOU BIN WILL WHAT WERE YO OUT FOR IN THIS NASTY DAMP
SHE THREW DOWN HER APRON WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR AS SHE STOOD BESIDE HIM IN FRONT OF THE FIRE WATCHING THE PAN WHAT AM I TO DO JIM AN THEM CHILLEN WHEN YOU'RE TOOK TO PRISON SHE ASKED HIM VEHEMENTLY I SHAN'T GET TOOK TO PRISON I TELL YER
YOU'LL TRUST ME I COULD ALWAYS DO SOMETHING SHE TOOK MISSUS HURD'S HAND WITH A SWEET LOOK AND GESTURE STANDING THERE IN HER TALL VIGOROUS YOUTH HER FURS WRAPPED ABOUT HER
WOULDN'T WE JES ANSWER ME THAT DIDN'T WE SIT HERE AN STARVE TILL THE BONES WAS COMIN THROUGH THE CHILLEN'S SKIN DIDN'T WE THAT HE COULD STILL ARGUE THE POINT WITH HER SHOWED THE INNER VULNERABLENESS THE INNER NEED OF HER AFFECTION
IN HER EAGER WAY TO TRY AND PENETRATE THEIR PEASANT LIVES WHICH WERE SO FULL OF ENIGMA AND ATTRACTION TO HER MAINLY BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY DEFECTIVENESS THEIR CLOSENESS TO AN ANIMAL SIMPLICITY NEVER TO BE REACHED BY ANY ONE OF HER SORT
AS COULDN'T PAY HIM BACK THAT MADE HIM AS CROSS AS VINEGAR AN WHEN JIM BEGAN TO BE ABOUT WITH ME OV A SUNDAY SOMETIMES INSTEAD OF HIM HE GOT MADDER AND MADDER AN JIM ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM HE BEGGED OF ME
THE STATELY LADY HAD DIED WHILE SHE WAS STILL A CHILD AT HER FIRST SCHOOL SHE COULD RECOLLECT HER OWN MOURNING FROCK BUT THAT WAS ALMOST THE LAST PERSONAL REMEMBRANCE SHE HAD CONNECTED WITH THE MERRITTS
OH THANK YOU THANK YOU KINDLY MISS SAID MISSUS HURD RAISING HER APRON TO HER EYES TO STAUNCH SOME IRREPRESSIBLE TEARS AS MARCELLA SHOWED HER THE ADVERTISEMENT WHICH IT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE WORTH HURD'S WHILE TO ANSWER
HE TREATED HIM CRUEL HE'D KICK AND SWEAR AT HIM THEN HE'D DARE HIM TO FIGHT AN THRASH HIM TILL THE OTHERS CAME IN AN GOT HIM AWAY THEN HE'D CARRY TALES TO HIS FATHER AND ONE DAY OLD WESTALL BEAT JIM WITHIN AN INCH OF IS LIFE WITH A STRAP END
MARCELLA FELT AN INSTANT'S FEAR FEAR OF THE IRONIC POWER IN THE SPARKLING LOOK SO KEENLY FIXED ON HER OFFENDING SELF SHE SHRANK BEFORE THE PROUD RESERVE EXPRESSED IN EVERY LINE OF HER MOTHER'S FRAGILE IMPERIOUS BEAUTY
NOT O BREAKIN OV EM BUT I'M SICK O THIS WHERE'S THEM CHILLEN WHY DO YER LET THAT BOY OUT SO LATE AND OPENING THE DOOR HE STOOD ON THE THRESHOLD LOOKING UP AND DOWN THE VILLAGE STREET WHILE MINTA ONCE MORE GAVE UP THE STRUGGLE DRIED HER EYES
ANY LETTERS SHE ASKED NO BUT THERE ARE SOME CARDS OH YES THERE IS A NOTE AND SHE POUNCED UPON AN ENVELOPE SHE HAD OVERLOOKED IT IS FOR YOU MOTHER
AND NOW THIS NOTE OF INTENSE PERSONAL AND FAMILY PRIDE UNDER WHICH MISSUS BOYCE'S VOICE HAD FOR THE FIRST TIME QUIVERED A LITTLE MARCELLA HAD NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE AND IT THRILLED HER
SHE CAUGHT HER MOTHER STANDING ABSENTLY AT THE TEA TABLE THE LITTLE SILVER CADDY WAS STILL IN HER HAND AS THOUGH SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO PUT IT DOWN AND HER EYES WHICH EVIDENTLY SAW NOTHING WERE TURNED TO THE WINDOW THE BROWS FROWNING
A SMALL ELDERLY LADY IN A VERY LARGE MUSHROOM HAT DROVE PAST HER IN THE DUSK AND BOWED STIFFLY MARCELLA WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE BARELY RETURNED THE BOW THEN SHE LOOKED AFTER THE CARRIAGE THAT WAS MISS RAEBURN
I ASKED MISTER ALDOUS RAEBURN THE OTHER DAY WHETHER EVERYBODY HERE WAS GOING TO CUT US PAPA TOLD ME THAT LORD MAXWELL HAD WRITTEN HIM AN UNCIVIL LETTER AND YOU ASKED MISTER RAEBURN SAID MISSUS BOYCE QUICKLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THEN A CRY OF NATURE BROKE FROM THE GIRL YOU HAVE GOT USED TO IT MAMMA
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS I WANT TO DO HERE AND ONE CAN DO NOTHING IF EVERY ONE IS AGAINST YOU PEOPLE WOULD BE FRIENDS WITH YOU AND ME AND WITH PAPA TOO THROUGH US SOME OF THEM WISH TO BE KIND
I MUST GO AND MAKE THE TEA SHE SAID IN A LIGHT COLD TONE AND TURNING SHE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHITHER AFTERNOON TEA HAD JUST BEEN CARRIED MARCELLA FOLLOWED READING THE NOTE WAS FROM MISS RAEBURN
MARCELLA HUNG OVER HER ONE FLAME OF PASSIONATE PITY COMFORTING SOOTHING PROMISING HELP MISSUS HURD PRESENTLY RECOVERED ENOUGH TO TELL HER THAT HURD HAD GONE OFF THAT MORNING
YET NO DOUBT HE IS A VALUABLE KEEPER LORD MAXWELL WOULD BE SORRY TO LOSE HIM IT IS THE SYSTEM MAKES SUCH MEN AND MUST HAVE THEM THE CLATTER OF A PONY CARRIAGE DISTURBED HER THOUGHTS
MARCELLA NOTICED THAT SHE GREETED NONE OF THE OLD PEOPLE NOR THEY HER AND AS FOR MISSUS HURD AS SOON AS SHE SAW THE KEEPER'S WIFE SHE TURNED HER BACK ABRUPTLY ON HER VISITOR AND WALKED TO THE OTHER END OF THE KITCHEN ARE YOU COMIN MOTHER REPEATED ISABELLA
SUCH A KIND HUSBAND AND FATHER SO FULL OF A DUMB WISH TO SHOW HER HE WAS GRATEFUL TO HER FOR MARRYING SUCH A FELLOW AS HE THE QUARREL WITH WESTALL SEEMED TO HAVE SUNK OUT OF HIS MIND HE NEVER SPOKE TO OR OF HIM LOW WAGES
MISSUS HURD SAID WONDERING
AND WENT OUT OF THE COTTAGE BY THE BACK DOOR INTO THE GARDEN THE WIFE SAT IN SOME AGITATION A MOMENT THEN SHE RESUMED HE CAN'T BEAR NO TALK ABOUT WESTALL IT SEEMS TO DRIVE HIM SILLY BUT I SAY AS HOW PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS GLAD TO FAIL THERE WAS A CERTAIN EASE AND JAUNTINESS IN HIS AIR TO NIGHT
THINKING OF ALDOUS RAEBURN'S WORDS AND EXPRESSION AS HE BENT TO HER AT THE GATE I KNOW THEY DO AND IF WE CAN'T HOLD OUR HEADS HIGH BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THINGS IN THE PAST OUGHT WE TO BE SO PROUD
BY INSTINCTS ONLY RECENTLY REVIVED AFTER LONG DORMANCY BUT NOW HARD TO RESIST PRESENTLY HE TURNED WITH ANGER UPON ONE OF MINTA'S WAILS WHICH HAPPENED TO REACH HIM LOOK ERE SAID HE TO HER
AN SETTIN HIS FATHER AGAINST ANY OF EM AS DIDN'T GIVE IN TO HIM
OF HEARING THE SPHINX'S RIDICULOUS ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS AND INCIDENTALLY TO TRY IF POSSIBLE TO DISCOVER HER IDENTITY EMMA HAD SUCCEEDED IN CHANGING HER VOICE SO COMPLETELY THAT THE FAR AWAY ALMOST WAILING TONES OF THE EGYPTIAN WONDER
YOU'RE NOT CONTRADICTED MARY UNSYMPATHETICALLY HE OPENED HIS EYES QUITE WIDE WITH INDIGNATION
THE ADMISSION FEE HAD BEEN FIXED AT TWENTY FIVE CENTS AND THE PUBLIC HAD BEEN INVITED AS A COLLEGE TOWN OVERTON'S PUBLIC WAS LARGELY MADE UP OF THE CLASSES RATHER THAN THE MASSES AND MANY OF THE VISITORS CLAIMED OVERTON AS THEIR ALMA MATER THE STUDENTS HOWEVER
SO FAR NOTHING STARTLING HAS HAPPENED REPLIED ANNE REALLY ELEANOR HAPPENED ALONG AT A GOOD TIME FOR MARIAN WHY DID SHE ASKED GRACE QUICKLY
IN THE HEARING OF ALL THAT HE WOULD GOVERN HIS PEOPLE WITH STRICT JUSTICE AND THAT HE WOULD OBSERVE THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND MAINTAIN THE OLD CUSTOMS OF THE TRIBE OR KINGDOM THEN HE PUT BY HIS SWORD
I WISH THA'D GONE HE WAS NIGH GOIN INTO ONE O HIS TANTRUMS THERE'S BEEN A NICE TO DO ALL AFTERNOON TO KEEP HIM QUIET
WHAT ARE YOU SAID MARY SELFISH PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THAT ANY ONE IS SELFISH WHO DOESN'T DO WHAT THEY WANT YOU'RE MORE SELFISH THAN I AM YOU'RE THE MOST SELFISH BOY I EVER SAW I'M NOT SNAPPED COLIN
ALL WITH GOOD SALARIES THE HIGHER THE GRADE OF THE KING THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF HIS HOUSEHOLD AND THE GRANDER THE PERSONS HOLDING OFFICES FORMING PART OF HIS RETINUE THERE WERE NOBLES WHO DID NOTHING AT ALL BUT WAIT ON HIM
THE OLD IRISH KINGS LIVED IN GREAT STYLE ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE HIGHER RANKS AND LIKE THE KINGS OF OUR OWN DAY KEPT IN THEIR PALACES NUMBERS OF PERSONS TO ATTEND ON THEM HOLDING VARIOUS OFFICES
IT'S A PLEASURE TO HEAR HER RECITE I DO ADMIRE HER ABILITY AGREED ANNE PERHAPS SHE WILL SEE THROUGH HENRY HAMMOND AND PERSUADE MARIAN TO DROP HIM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID GRACE DUBIOUSLY I SAW HIM WITH ELEANOR IN THE RUN ABOUT THE OTHER DAY
AND HE REGULATED THE RECEPTION OF GUESTS
GRACE HAD PAUSED FOR A MOMENT OUTSIDE THE GYPSY ENCAMPMENT TO CAST A SPECULATIVE EYE OVER THE CROWD WHICH SEEMED TO BE STEADILY INCREASING
ARE YOU MAKING HAMMOND YOUR VICTIM YOU MAY TEASE ME IF YOU LIKE REPLIED GRACE WITH DIGNITY BUT SOME DAY YOU'LL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS RIGHT ALL RIGHT GIRLIE SMILED HER FATHER SHALL I SAY SO NOW
THE IRISH TOOK CARE THAT THEIR KINGS HAD NOT TOO MUCH POWER IN THEIR HANDS SO THAT THEY COULD NOT ALWAYS DO AS THEY PLEASED A PROPER AND WISE ARRANGEMENT THEY WERE WHAT WE NOW CALL LIMITED MONARCHS
IT WOULD BE A WILDERNESS OF GROWING THINGS BEFORE THE SPRINGTIME WAS OVER THERE'LL BE APPLE BLOSSOMS AN CHERRY BLOSSOMS OVERHEAD DICKON SAID WORKING AWAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
AND HAD A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHT AS IT WAS THEY DID THE NEXT THING TO IT YOU ARE A SELFISH THING
DID YOU KNOW THAT MISSUS GRAY HAS POSTPONED COMING HOME UNTIL MARCH YES ANSWERED GRACE SHE UNDERSTOOD ANNE'S GROWING DESPAIR AS TIME WENT ON AND THE PROSPECT OF EARNING ENOUGH MONEY TO DEFRAY HER COLLEGE EXPENSES GREW LESS
HE ANSWERED WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER I MADE THEM PUT ME BACK IN BED THIS AFTERNOON MY BACK ACHED AND MY HEAD ACHED AND I WAS TIRED WHY DIDN'T YOU COME I WAS WORKING IN THE GARDEN WITH DICKON SAID MARY COLIN FROWNED AND CONDESCENDED TO LOOK AT HER
TO SEE MARTHA STANDING WAITING FOR HER WITH A DOLEFUL FACE WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED WHAT DID COLIN SAY WHEN YOU TOLD HIM I COULDN'T COME
WHICH ALMOST PUT AN END TO THE CIRCUS THEN AND THERE AFTER DUE CONSIDERATION THE PERFORMERS AGREED TO GO ON WITH THE SPECTACLE BUT MANY AND INDIGNANT WERE THE THEORIES ADVANCED AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE NEWS HAD TRAVELED ABROAD THAT THE INFORMATION HAD GONE FORTH THROUGH A MEMBER OF THE CLUB
WHO WERE SUBJECT TO THE ARD RI THE PROVINCES WERE DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF TERRITORIES OVER WHICH WERE KINGS OF A STILL LOWER GRADE EACH UNDER THE KING OF HIS OWN PROVINCE
DON'T GIVE UP YET DEAR GRACE PRESSED ANNE'S HAND
IN ROSCOMMON THE MOST IMPORTANT RESIDENCE OF THE LEINSTER KINGS
THE GIRLS SEPARATED AT THE CORNER AND WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS
TIED UP ON ONE SIDE WITH A BLUE RIBBON LOOKED EXACTLY AS LEWIS CARROLL'S IMMORTAL ALICE MIGHT HAVE LOOKED IF SHE HAD BEEN INSPIRED WITH LIFE ALICE WAS ALLOWED TO SHOW HERSELF TO THE PUBLIC BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE AND ON CATCHING SIGHT OF GRACE
DON'T SAY THAT GRACE SAID ANNE QUICKLY I NEVER SHALL
YOU KNOW MY VIEWS ON THAT SUBJECT I WAS ONLY JESTING DEAR GRACE ASSURED HER SEEING THE LOOK OF ANXIETY THAT CREPT INTO ANNE'S EYES I KNOW YOU'LL COME BACK WE COULDN'T GRADUATE WITHOUT YOU
IF YOU SEND DICKON AWAY I'LL NEVER COME INTO THIS ROOM AGAIN SHE RETORTED
FOUR THIRTY EIGHT THIRTY AND NINE THIRTY RESPECTIVELY IN WHICH WOULD APPEAR THE CELEBRATED ALICE IN WONDERLAND ANIMALS
YOU JUST SAY THAT TO MAKE PEOPLE SORRY I BELIEVE YOU'RE PROUD OF IT I DON'T BELIEVE IT IF YOU WERE A NICE BOY IT MIGHT BE TRUE BUT YOU'RE TOO NASTY
WERE THE HOPE ON WHICH THE CLUB BASED ITS DREAMS OF PROFIT NO GIRL COULD WALK AROUND THE GYMNASIUM WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY SHE COULDN'T RESIST THOSE DARLING SHOPS THEY ARE ALL TOO FASCINATING FOR WORDS ARLINE HAD DECLARED RAPTUROUSLY
HE SAID MARY FLEW INTO A FINE PASSION SHE COULD FLY INTO A PASSION WITHOUT MAKING A NOISE
MARY WENT BACK TO HER ROOM NOT FEELING AT ALL
THIS IS THE SECOND CONVERSATION OF THE SORT THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THAT I HAVE OVERHEARD I WONDER IF HE HAS PERSUADED MARIAN TO PUT MONEY INTO HIS REAL ESTATE SCHEMES FOR I BELIEVE THEY ARE NOTHING BUT SCHEMES
I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO GIVE IT ALL UP FOR NEXT YEAR AT LEAST GRACE ANNE'S VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE
HER COMPANION ANSWERED IN ROUGH TONES
DOLLS TOYS BOOKS SHE OPENED THE PACKAGE WONDERING IF HE HAD SENT A DOLL
A FIERCE AND MIGHTY MAN WHO ANSWERED CHALLENGES AND WHEN NECESSARY FOUGHT SINGLE COMBATS FOR THE HONOUR OF THE KING GUARDS WERE ALWAYS AT HAND WHO REMAINED STANDING UP WITH DRAWN SWORDS OR BATTLEAXES DURING DINNER
AND THE APPLAUSE HAD DIED AWAY IN A PLEASANT HUM OF CONVERSATION THAT AROSE FROM THE THRONG OF STUDENTS AND VISITORS THAT MORE THAN COMFORTABLY FILLED THE GYMNASIUM I DON'T SEE HOW THOSE GIRLS MANAGED TO ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH IN SO SHORT A TIME
I MADE THE PAWS RATHER REALISTIC AREN'T THEY ALL THIS DRAPERY CAME WITH THE HEAD I AM INSIDE THE HEAD SITTING ON A STOOL IT'S RATHER DARK AND STUFFY
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SHE ASKED HER AT YOU TWO YOUNG ONES SAID THE NURSE
WHO HAD COME UP AND NOW STOOD BESIDE HER
JUST THEN ANNE EXCLAIMED VERY SOFTLY LOOK GRACE ISN'T THAT MARIAN AND HER CAVALIER WHERE ASKED GRACE TURNING QUICKLY ACROSS THE STREET COMING IN THIS DIRECTION I DO BELIEVE MARIAN IS CRYING TOO THEY ARE CROSSING NOW AND WILL PASS US
BECAME SUDDENLY DISCONCERTED BY THE STEADY SCORNFUL GAZE OF TWO PAIRS OF EYES THAT LOOKED THEIR FULL MEASURE OF CONTEMPT AND HASTILY TURNING HIS ATTENTION TO MARIAN PASSED BY WITHOUT SPEAKING CONTEMPTIBLE COWARD RAGED GRACE DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID ANNE
AND IN MOST OF THEM THE RAMPARTS AND MOUNDS ARE STILL TO BE SEEN MORE OR LESS DILAPIDATED AFTER THE LONG LAPSE OF TIME THE RUINS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES SUCH AS WE SEE THEM NOW ARE DESCRIBED IN SOME DETAIL
WITH A SAVAGE CUT IT OUT CAN'T YOU DON'T LET EVERY ONE KNOW YOUR BUSINESS
I HADN'T HEARD THAT SAID GRACE
WHY ARE YOU SO BITTER AGAINST THAT YOUNG MAN DAUGHTER ASKED HER FATHER RATHER CURIOUSLY WHEN SHE INTERVIEWED HIM AS TO THE BEST MEANS OF FINDING OUT SOMETHING OF HENRY HAMMOND'S PAST HE SEEMS TO BE A GOOD STRAIGHT FORWARD YOUNG FELLOW
THIS WAS A BAD BEGINNING AND MARY MARCHED UP TO HIM WITH HER STIFF MANNER WHY DIDN'T YOU GET UP SHE SAID
I'M A SURE ENOUGH GRADUATE NOW UNLESS SOMETHING SERIOUS HAPPENS SO AM I REPLIED ANNE IF I COULD GET CLERICAL WORK TO DO THIS TERM I'D RECITE IN THE MORNING ONLY AND GIVE MY AFTERNOONS TO EARNING A LITTLE MONEY IT SEEMS AS THOUGH EVERYTHING IS AGAINST ME
HE WAS AT THE WHEEL AND THEY SEEMED TO BE HAVING A VERY INTERESTING SESSION WITHOUT MARIAN HE NEVER DID GIVE ME THE IMPRESSION OF BEING A VERY CONSTANT SWAIN LAUGHED ANNE I'M SO GLAD THAT MID YEAR EXAMS ARE OVER SIGHED GRACE
AS SUITED HIS FANCY OR CONVENIENCE
OTHERS OF LESS IMPORTANCE LOWER DOWN WHILE THE ATTENDANTS WHEN THEY WERE NOT OTHERWISE OCCUPIED SAT AT TABLES OF THEIR OWN AT THE LOWER END OF THE HALL TO PAY THE EXPENSES OF HIS GREAT HOUSEHOLD
HE SHOULD KNOW HIS HUNCH HAD BEGUN TO GROW SOMETHING HE HAD HEARD MISSUS MEDLOCK WHISPERING TO THE NURSE HAD GIVEN HIM THE IDEA
WHY ANNE THINK OF IT YOU WILL HAVE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SIX WEEKS WORK
REPLIED MISS DUNCAN WARMLY WHICH WAS A REMARKABLE STATEMENT FROM THIS RATHER AUSTERE TEACHER THE JUNIOR CLASS IS PARTICULARLY RICH IN GOOD MATERIAL REPLIED THE DEAN I COULD NAME AT LEAST A DOZEN YOUNG WOMEN WHOM I CONSIDER SPLENDID TYPES OF THE IDEAL OVERTON GIRL
HE'S BETTER THAN A COMMON RAJAH RETORTED MARY HE'S A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER BECAUSE SHE WAS THE STRONGER OF THE TWO SHE WAS BEGINNING TO GET THE BETTER OF HIM THE TRUTH WAS THAT HE HAD NEVER HAD A FIGHT WITH ANY ONE LIKE HIMSELF IN HIS LIFE
NOW CALLED KNOCKAULIN AN IMMENSE FORT SURROUNDING THE SUMMIT OF A HILL NEAR KILCULLEN IN KILDARE
KEEPERS OF HOUNDS AND COURSING DOGS A CHIEF SWINEHERD WITH HIS UNDERLINGS FOOLS JUGGLERS AND JESTERS FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE COMPANY WITH A WHOLE ARMY OF UNDER SERVANTS AND WORKMEN OF VARIOUS KINDS
AND PLAYED THE SOFT STRANGE LITTLE NOTES
SHE FELT SO SOUR AND UNRELENTING THAT FOR A FEW MINUTES SHE ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT DICKON AND THE GREEN VEIL CREEPING OVER THE WORLD AND THE SOFT WIND BLOWING
AND HELD TO HER UNRELENTING RESOLVE TO BE REVENGED UPON THEM INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNITY SHOULD ARISE IN CAUTIONING HER FRIENDS THE PREVIOUS YEAR AGAINST PLACING THEMSELVES IN A POSITION LIABLE TO PUT THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH ELEANOR
SHE FOUND THE TRAINED NURSE STANDING AS IF SHE HAD BEEN LISTENING AND MORE AMAZING STILL SHE WAS LAUGHING SHE WAS A BIG HANDSOME YOUNG WOMAN WHO OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN A TRAINED NURSE AT ALL AS SHE COULD NOT BEAR INVALIDS AND SHE WAS ALWAYS MAKING EXCUSES TO LEAVE COLIN TO MARTHA
AND CAHER IN TIPPERARY ALSO WE HAVE NAAS IN KILDARE DUNLAVIN IN WICKLOW
ALSO DYESTUFFS SEWING THREAD FIREWOOD HORSES RICH BRIDLES CHESSBOARDS JEWELLERY AND SOMETIMES GOLD AND SILVER RECKONED OUT IN OUNCES AS ABRAHAM PAID EPHRON FOR THE CAVE
WITH BEST WISHES I REMAIN YOURS SINCERELY EVERETT SOUTHARD WELL I SHOULD SAY THE UNEXPECTED HAD HAPPENED SAID GRACE AS ANNE FINISHED READING
I E LEARNED AND DISTINGUISHED MEN OF THE SEVERAL PROFESSIONS HISTORIANS POETS PHYSICIANS BUILDERS BREHONS OR JUDGES MUSICIANS AND SO FORTH
AND THEIR SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION WITH NUMEROUS OTHER MATTERS OF A LIKE KIND ALL PERTAINING TO THE HOUSEHOLD HIS WORD WAS LAW AND NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF QUESTIONING HIS ARRANGEMENTS
IN RECEIVING AND ENTERTAINING GUESTS BESIDES ALL THIS
EACH KING OF WHATEVER GRADE SHOULD ACCORDING TO LAW HAVE AT LEAST THREE CHIEF RESIDENCES
WHO ISSUED ORDERS EACH DAY FOR THE PROVISIONS TO BE LAID IN FOR NEXT DAY THE NUMBER OF OXEN SHEEP AND HOGS TO BE SLAUGHTERED THE QUANTITY OF BREAD TO BE BAKED AND OF ALE MEAD AND WINE TO BE MEASURED OUT
NOW I WON'T TELL YOU A SINGLE THING
ANOTHER FEATURE WHEN SHALL WE HAVE IT WON'T THAT BE SPLENDID NOT THIS AFTERNOON LATE IN THE EVENING COUNSELED EMMA
SHE WAS CROSS AND DISAPPOINTED
AND JUST WHAT WE INTENDED TO HAVE WHEN WE WANTED THE WHOLE THING TO BE A SURPRISE REALLY I THINK THE PERSON WHO TOLD THE TALES DID US A GOOD TURN AFTER ALL LAUGHED GRACE THE GIRLS WERE EVER SO MUCH MORE ANXIOUS TO ATTEND THE BAZAAR AFTER THEY HEARD OF THE CIRCUS
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCONCERTING TO SAY THE LEAST
YOU'RE A DEAR LAUGHED GRACE RUBBING HER SOFT CHEEK AGAINST HIS ONLY YOU WILL TEASE
YES I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LOOK AT THE MATTER IN THE SAME LIGHT
HE HAD A LARGE TRACT OF LAND FREE BESIDES WHICH EVERY TENANT AND HOUSEHOLDER THROUGHOUT HIS DOMINION HAD TO MAKE A YEARLY PAYMENT ACCORDING TO HIS MEANS THESE PAYMENTS WERE MADE NOT IN MONEY
SAID THE NURSE HYSTERICS AND TEMPER ARE HALF WHAT AILS HIM WHAT ARE HYSTERICS ASKED MARY
AND IF NECESSARY TAKE THEIR VOTES WHEN THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS AND BESIDES THIS KINGS AS WE SHALL SEE FARTHER ON HAD TO OBEY THE LAW THE SAME AS THEIR SUBJECTS
UNFOLDING THE LETTER THAT SHE HAD BEEN HOLDING IN ONE HAND
THERE IS AN ARRANGEMENT INSIDE THE HEAD THAT MAKES PROMENADING POSSIBLE
THAT IS THEY COULD NOT ENTER ON ANY IMPORTANT UNDERTAKING AFFECTING THE KINGDOM OR THE PUBLIC WITHOUT CONSULTING THEIR PEOPLE ON SUCH OCCASIONS THE KING HAD TO CALL A MEETING OF HIS CHIEF MEN AND ASK THEIR ADVICE
THA'S A GOOD BIT STRONGER THAN THA WAS DICKON SAID LOOKING AT HER AS SHE WAS DIGGING THA'S BEGINNING TO LOOK DIFFERENT FOR SURE MARY WAS GLOWING WITH EXERCISE AND GOOD SPIRITS I'M GETTING FATTER AND FATTER EVERY DAY SHE SAID QUITE EXULTANTLY
AND ISN'T SHE GREAT HOW DID EMMA HAPPEN TO THINK OF HER LET ALONE GETTING HER UP
AS SHE AND GRACE WERE TAKING A LAST WALK AROUND THE GREAT GAYLY DECORATED ROOM BEFORE GOING TO LUNCHEON THAT DAY NOW AS THEY STOOD SIDE BY SIDE ANXIOUSLY WATCHING THE STEADILY INCREASING TIDE OF VISITORS
THAT IS IF YOU CAN STAND STILL LONG ENOUGH TO DO IT I HAVE HAD THE SURPRISE OF MY LIFE TO NIGHT GRACE SAID ANNE AS SHE ENTERED THE HALL
HE WAS AT ONCE FURIOUS AND SLIGHTLY PLEASED IF A PERSON COULD BE BOTH AT ONE TIME I'M NOT HE CRIED I AM YOU KNOW I AM EVERYBODY SAYS SO I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID MARY SOURLY
THEN ALBERTA WICKS MARY HAMPTON AND KATHLEEN WEST WERE USHERED INTO THE TENT I AM THE SPHINX BEGAN THE FAR AWAY VOICE AGAIN IN THE MAMMOTH HEAD ASK ME A QUESTION
SAID GRACE RISING AND PUTTING ONE FINGER UNDER ANNE'S CHIN LOOK ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND TELL THE TRUTH YOU THOUGHT I'D BE SHOCKED
YES REPLIED MISS DUNCAN MISS HARLOWE SEEMS TO HAVE PLENTY OF INITIATIVE SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THIS NEW CLUB
EMMA DEAN'S FAMILIAR DRAWL STARTLED BOTH GRACE AND ARLINE MY BROTHER HAD IT MADE FOR A COLLEGE PLAY CALLED SPHINX WHEN WE BEGAN TO PLAN FOR THE BAZAAR I SENT HOME FOR IT
CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS GRACE LOST NO TIME IN PUTTING HER RESOLUTION INTO PRACTICE AND LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED REGARDING THE OBJECT OF HER DISTRUST
SHE WAS STARTLED BY A LOUD RINGING OF THE BELL GOING TO THE DOOR SHE BEHELD ANNE WHO WAS FAIRLY WRIGGLING WITH EXCITEMENT HER CHEEKS WERE FLUSHED AND HER DARK EYES WERE LIKE STARS OH GRACE SHE CRIED THE UNEXPECTED HAS HAPPENED
AND GRACE DEPLORING THE FACT THAT ANNE WAS TOO PROUD TO ACCEPT ANY HELP FROM HER FRIENDS AS GRACE WAS ABOUT TO CURL HERSELF UP IN A BIG CHAIR BEFORE THE FIRE THAT NIGHT WITH RICHARD CARVEL IN ONE HAND AND A BOX OF PEANUT BRITTLE IN THE OTHER
WAS RECEIVING GREAT BENEFIT FROM HER HIGH SCHOOL ASSOCIATIONS SHE STOOD NEXT TO ANNE PIERSON IN HER CLASSES AND HER APTITUDE FOR STUDY AND BRILLIANT RECITATIONS EVOKED THE ADMIRATION OF THE ENTIRE CLASS BUT DESPITE THESE CHANGES FOR THE BETTER
UNTIL THE PATRONS OF THE BAZAAR SHOULD ENTER THE GYMNASIUM BUT IN SOME MYSTERIOUS MANNER THE SECRET HAD LEAKED OUT EVEN THE IDENTITY OF CERTAIN ANIMALS WAS KNOWN AND WHEN THIS UNPLEASANT NEWS HAD REACHED THE EARS OF THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES A MEETING WAS CALLED
I THINK IT COUNTS DECLARED ARLINE STUBBORNLY I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT AS LONG AS I LIVE
BOWING TO THE NEWCOMERS RATHER COLDLY GRACE AND ARLINE TURNED TO LEAVE THE TENT BUT GRACE REFLECTED GRIMLY AS SHE LIFTED THE TENT FLAP THAT IF ANY ONE OF THE TRIO HAD BEEN THE ALL WISE SPHINX INSTEAD OF HER FRIEND EMMA DEAN
I HAD INSIDE INFORMATION THAT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE MONEY ON IT YOU ACT LIKE A BABY THEN HE MUTTERED SOMETHING THAT WAS INAUDIBLE TO THE LISTENERS YOU ARE VERY UNKIND HENRY WAILED MARIAN BUT IN THE NEXT INSTANT HENRY HAMMOND HAD SEEN THE TWO GIRLS
THAT MOST OF HIS TANTRUMS AS THEY CALLED THEM GREW OUT OF HIS HYSTERICAL HIDDEN FEAR MARY HAD BEEN SORRY FOR HIM WHEN HE HAD TOLD HER HE ALWAYS BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT IT WHEN HE WAS CROSS OR TIRED
I THINK THE IDEA IS SIMPLY GREAT DON'T YOU
AND WHEN A KING DIED THOSE CHIEFS WHO HAD VOTES HELD A MEETING LASTING FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS AT WHICH THEY ELECTED WHATEVER MEMBER OF THAT FAMILY THEY CONSIDERED THE WISEST BEST AND BRAVEST
MOVING QUITE LEISURELY IN HIS CHARIOT FROM PLACE TO PLACE WITH A NUMEROUS RETINUE ALL IN THEIR OWN CHARIOTS WHILE THE SEVERAL SUB KINGS THROUGH WHOSE TERRITORIES HE PASSED HAD TO LODGE FEED AND ENTERTAIN THE WHOLE COMPANY FREE
AND TWO OF THEM WERE ABOUT GARDENS AND WERE FULL OF PICTURES THERE WERE TWO OR THREE GAMES AND THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE WRITING CASE WITH A GOLD MONOGRAM ON IT AND A GOLD PEN AND INKSTAND EVERYTHING WAS SO NICE THAT HER PLEASURE BEGAN TO CROWD HER ANGER OUT OF HER MIND
HE HAD A WAY OF DOING THAT WHICH SHE COULD NOT BEAR
WITH AN INAUGURATION STONE ON TOP AND OFTEN A GREAT BRANCHING OLD TREE UNDER THE SHADE OF WHICH THE MAIN PROCEEDINGS WERE CARRIED ON THE NEW KING STANDING ON THE INAUGURATION STONE SWORE A SOLEMN OATH
IF THE DISTRICT WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO HAVE A KING IT WAS RULED BY A CHIEF WHO WAS SUBJECT TO THE KING OF THE LARGER TERRITORY IN WHICH THE DISTRICT WAS INCLUDED THE KING WAS ALWAYS CHOSEN FROM ONE PARTICULAR RULING FAMILY
I CAN'T STAY SHE ANSWERED DICKON'S WAITING FOR ME AND SHE RAN AWAY THE AFTERNOON WAS EVEN LOVELIER AND BUSIER THAN THE MORNING HAD BEEN ALREADY NEARLY ALL THE WEEDS WERE CLEARED OUT OF THE GARDEN AND MOST OF THE ROSES AND TREES HAD BEEN PRUNED OR DUG ABOUT
EVERY GIRL LOVES ALICE IN WONDERLAND I THINK AND THEN THE SPHINX IS A FIRST CLASS SURPRISE ISN'T IT FUNNY CHUCKLED ARLINE WHO IN HER SHORT WHITE EMBROIDERED DRESS PALE BLUE SASH BLUE SILK STOCKINGS AND HEELLESS BLUE KID SLIPPERS
I DON'T THINK THEY'VE SEEN US YET COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS THE APPROACHING COUPLE HAD NOT NOTICED EITHER GRACE OR ANNE HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO FOOLISH THE TWO GIRLS HEARD MARIAN SAY TEARFULLY
MARTHA SAYS MY HAIR IS GROWING THICKER
AND EXERCISED THEIR SEVERAL PROFESSIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE KING AND HIS HOUSEHOLD FOR WHICH EACH HAD A HOUSE AND A TRACT OF LAND FREE OR SOME OTHER EQUIVALENT STIPEND THEN THERE WAS A HOUSE STEWARD
BUT MARY'S FACE LOOKED AS PINCHED AS A NUTCRACKER I'M GOING SHE SAID AND I WON'T COME BACK SHE WALKED TO THE DOOR
GAINED CONSIDERABLE POPULARITY WITH A NUMBER OF THE SENIOR CLASS AND WIELDED A TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE OVER THEM SHE HAD DROPPED HER ANNOYING TACTICS TOWARD THE TEACHERS AND HER CONDUCT DURING THE YEAR HAD BEEN IRREPROACHABLE
ALTHOUGH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE ACT WAS REPREHENSIBLE THE ACT ITSELF HAD SERVED ONLY AS A MEANS OF ADVERTISING AND HAD AROUSED THE CURIOSITY AND INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC AFTER SEVERAL EARNEST DISCUSSIONS ON THE PART OF THE CLUB
BOTH DECLARED ARLINE BOLDLY
EACH DAY THE WHOLE COMPANY SAT IN THE GREAT HALL AT DINNER ARRANGED AT TABLES IN THE ORDER OF RANK THE GREAT GRANDEES
HE WAS CALLED THE ARD RI
SHE WANTED TO TELL COLIN ABOUT DICKON'S FOX CUB AND THE ROOK AND ABOUT WHAT THE SPRINGTIME HAD BEEN DOING SHE FELT SURE HE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR
STILL RETAINING ITS OLD NAME IN THE FORM OF GREENAN ELY THE CHIEF PALACE OF THE KINGS OF CONNAUGHT WAS CROGHAN THE OLD FORT OF WHICH LIES THREE MILES FROM TULSK
AND DICKON TALKED TO HIM JUST AS HE HAD TALKED TO THE ROBIN
FOR THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO COINED MONEY THEN BUT IN KIND THAT IS TO SAY CATTLE AND PROVISIONS OF VARIOUS SORTS PLOUGH OXEN HOGS SHEEP WITH MANTLES AND OTHER ARTICLES OF DRESS
AND GENTLY TWEAKED HIS EAR WITH HIS LARGE BEAK WHEN MARY WANTED TO REST A LITTLE DICKON SAT DOWN WITH HER UNDER A TREE
I KNOW JUST AS MUCH NOW AS I DID AT FIRST AND PERHAPS A TRIFLE LESS SAID GRACE THEN TAKING ANNE BY THE SHOULDERS SHE MARCHED HER INTO THE SITTING ROOM SHOVED HER INTO THE EASY CHAIR OPPOSITE HER OWN AND SAID NOW BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING AND DON'T LEAVE OUT ANY DETAILS
DRESSED AS A SAILOR DOLL PRESIDED THEN CAME THE JAPANESE TEA SHOP WITH THE EMERSON TWINS AS PROPRIETORS LOOKING SO REALISTICALLY JAPANESE THAT ARLINE DECLARED SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE THEY WERE THE EMERSON TWINS
IN MY TWO SOCIAL HISTORIES OF ANCIENT IRELAND BUT HERE OUR SPACE WILL NOT PERMIT US TO MENTION MORE THAN A FEW THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS TARA THE CHIEF RESIDENCE OF THE OVER KINGS WHICH IS SITUATED ON THE SUMMIT
AND THE CHIEF HOME OF CONCOBAR MAC NESSA AND THE RED BRANCH KNIGHTS THE IMPOSING REMAINS OF THIS PALACE CONSISTING OF A GREAT MOUND SURROUNDED BY AN IMMENSE CIRCULAR RAMPART
OF THE ZINGARI JINGLED THEIR TAMBOURINES IN THEIR FAMILIAR BUT EVER POPULAR SPANISH DANCE AND READ CURIOUS PINK PALMS ITCHING TO KNOW THE FUTURE ADJOINING THE GYPSY ENCAMPMENT WAS A DOLL SHOP OVER WHICH THE CUNNING FRESHMAN MYRA STONE
I DON'T KNOW AND I'M A POOR GUESSER SO TELL ME RESPONDED GRACE IT WAS FROM MISTER EVERETT SOUTHARD NO REALLY CRIED GRACE HOW NICE OF HIM TO WRITE TO YOU
BUT GRACE WHO IN SPITE OF HER FORMER DISAGREEMENT WITH HIM HAD FOR MARIAN'S SAKE FAVORED HIM WITH A COOL BOW WHEN HE HAPPENED TO CROSS HER PATH EVEN AFTER MARIAN HAD STOPPED SPEAKING WAS UP IN ARMS AT HIS DISPLAY OF RUDENESS TO THE GIRL WHO HAD CUT HERSELF OFF FROM HER DEAREST FRIENDS TO PLEASE HIM
I UNDERSTAND THEIR TREASURY IS ALREADY IN A FLOURISHING CONDITION THANKS TO THEIR OWN EFFORTS AND A TIMELY CONTRIBUTION THEY RECEIVED AFTER THEIR CONCERT LAST SPRING I CONSIDER MISS HARLOWE THE FINEST TYPE OF YOUNG WOMAN I HAVE ENCOUNTERED DURING ALL MY YEARS OF TEACHING
I DO HOPE EVERYONE WILL LIKE THE BAZAAR AND HAVE A GOOD TIME THIS AFTERNOON AND TO NIGHT EVERYTHING HAS GONE SO BEAUTIFULLY THERE HASN'T BEEN A SIGN OF A HITCH OH YES THERE WAS ONE HER FACE CLOUDED FOR A SECOND THEN SHE LOOKED AT ARLINE BRIGHTLY I'M NOT GOING TO THINK OF IT
AND ONE OF THE CHIEFS WHOSE SPECIAL OFFICE IT WAS PUT INTO HIS HAND A LONG STRAIGHT WHITE WAND THIS WAS TO SIGNIFY THAT HE WAS TO GOVERN NOT BY VIOLENCE OR HARSHNESS BUT BY JUSTICE
SIX MILES FROM NAVAN IN MEATH AND TWO MILES FROM THE MIDLAND RAILWAY STATION OF KILMESSAN THE VARIOUS MOUNDS CIRCULAR RAMPARTS AND OTHER FEATURES ARE PLAINLY MARKED ON THE PLAN GIVEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS BOOK
THE RUINS OF WHICH ARE SITUATED IN COUNTY DONEGAL ON THE SUMMIT OF A HILL EIGHT HUNDRED FEET HIGH FIVE MILES NORTH WEST FROM DERRY IT IS A CIRCULAR STONE FORTRESS OF DRY MASONRY
OR ANY ONE TAKING PART IN THE CIRCUS NO ONE OF THEM BELIEVED COMPLETE OSTRACISM THREATENED THE OFFENDER OR OFFENDERS PROVIDED SHE OR THEY AS THE CASE MIGHT BE WERE DISCOVERED LATER THE MEMBERS OF THE CLUB WERE FORCED TO ADMIT THAT
OR OVER KING BECAUSE HE CLAIMED AUTHORITY OVER ALL THE OTHERS THERE WAS ALSO A KING OVER EACH OF THE FIVE PROVINCES LEINSTER MUNSTER CONNAUGHT ULSTER AND MEATH
COME ON OVER AND SEE HER SHE COAXED A MOMENT LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE THE ENTRANCE TO A SMALL TENT HUNG WITH A HEAVY CURTAIN
BECAUSE HE ALWAYS LOOKED SO FRIGHTENED HIMSELF
WERE DISPENSING CAKES AND ICES TO A STEADILY INCREASING PATRONAGE THERE WAS A POSTCARD AND SOUVENIR BOOTH AROUND WHICH A CROWD SEEMED PERPETUALLY STATIONED THE SOUVENIRS CONSISTED MAINLY OF SMALL BLACK AND WHITE OR WATER COLOR SKETCHES
MARY'S LIPS PINCHED THEMSELVES TOGETHER
ASKED ARLINE CURIOUSLY MYSTERY ALL IS MYSTERY CROAKED THE SPHINX BUT YOU SAID YOU WOULD ANSWER MY QUESTION PERSISTED ARLINE WHICH ONE PLAINTIVELY INQUIRED THE VOICE
THE HOUSE STEWARD'S OFFICE WAS ONE OF GREAT RESPONSIBILITY AND HE HAD PLENTY OF ANXIETY AND WORRY AND ACCORDINGLY HE HELD A HIGH RANK AND WAS WELL PAID FOR HIS SERVICES THERE WAS A CHAMPION
DICKON HAD BROUGHT A SPADE OF HIS OWN AND HE HAD TAUGHT MARY TO USE ALL HER TOOLS
I DON'T BELIEVE ANY ONE OUTSIDE THE CLUB KNOWS EITHER
HE'S A VILLAIN I KNOW HE IS ASSERTED GRACE BUT HE'S TOO SHARP FOR ME NONSENSE LAUGHED HER FATHER
THEY PAY MORE THAN THAT IN COMPANIES LIKE MISTER SOUTHARD'S REPLIED ANNE IF I HAD ACQUIRED FAME I COULD COMMAND TWICE THAT SUM I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY HE EVER CHOSE ME SUPPOSE I SHOULD FAIL ENTIRELY NONSENSE RETORTED GRACE YOU COULDN'T FAIL IF YOU TRIED
AND HAD DIVIDED HER TIME AFTER SCHOOL EQUALLY BETWEEN ELEANOR SAVELLI AND HENRY HAMMOND ELEANOR HAD KEPT HER WORD IN REFERENCE TO EDNA WRIGHT AND THE TWO GIRLS EXCHANGED ONLY THE BAREST CIVILITIES WHENEVER THEY CHANCED TO MEET ELEANOR HAD HOWEVER
BUT OF COURSE NOW SHE FELT THAT COLIN WAS QUITE WRONG
THERE WAS A MASTER OF HORSE WITH NUMEROUS GROOMS KEEPERS OF THE KING'S JEWELS AND CHESSBOARDS COURIERS OR RUNNERS TO CONVEY THE KING'S MESSAGES AND ORDERS AND TO BRING HIM TIDINGS
AND ANYONE WHO WALKS OVER THE HILL WITH THE PLAN IN HIS HAND CAN EASILY RECOGNISE THEM NEXT TO TARA IN CELEBRITY WAS THE PALACE OF EMAIN OR EMANIA THE RESIDENCE OF THE KINGS OF ULSTER
THIS SUDDEN MYSTERIOUS CROAK THAT ISSUED FROM INSIDE THE GREAT HEAD CAUSED ARLINE TO START AND STEP BACK ASK ME A QUESTION I AM AS OLD AS THE WORLD
NOT FOR ANY ONE ELSE I'M NOT AS SELFISH AS YOU BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS ILL AND I'M SURE THERE IS A LUMP COMING ON MY BACK HE SAID
OF MACHPELAH MUCH INCOME ALSO ACCRUED TO THE KING FROM OTHER SOURCES NOT MENTIONED HERE AND HE WANTED IT ALL FOR HE WAS EXPECTED TO BE LAVISH IN GIVING PRESENTS AND HOSPITABLE WITHOUT STINT
AND THEY WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT THE PICTURES AND READ SOME OF THE GARDENING BOOKS AND PERHAPS TRIED PLAYING THE GAMES AND HE WOULD HAVE ENJOYED HIMSELF SO MUCH
MY DEAR MISS PIERSON REMEMBERING YOUR EXCEPTIONALLY FINE WORK AS ROSALIND IN THE PRODUCTION OF AS YOU LIKE IT GIVEN AT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL LAST YEAR
HE'S SELFISH IF YOU LIKE MARY'S EYES FLASHED FIRE HE'S NICER THAN ANY OTHER BOY THAT EVER LIVED SHE SAID HE'S HE'S LIKE AN ANGEL IT MIGHT SOUND RATHER SILLY TO SAY THAT BUT SHE DID NOT CARE A NICE ANGEL COLIN SNEERED FEROCIOUSLY
AND FOSSE HALF OBLITERATED THE WHOLE STRUCTURE COVERING ABOUT ELEVEN ENGLISH ACRES LIE TWO MILES WEST OF ARMAGH ANOTHER ULSTER PALACE QUITE AS IMPORTANT AS EMAIN
THEN THEY PAUSED BEFORE A PLATFORM ABOUT FOUR FEET IN HEIGHT ON WHICH REPOSED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GIGANTIC SPHINX HER PAWS STIFFLY FOLDED IN FRONT OF HER ASK ME A QUESTION
THAT'S AS SPOILED AS HIMSELF AND SHE LAUGHED INTO HER HANDKERCHIEF AGAIN IF HE'D HAD A YOUNG VIXEN OF A SISTER TO FIGHT WITH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAVING OF HIM IS HE GOING TO DIE
WHEN SHE HAD HAD A HEADACHE IN INDIA
WELL SAID ANNE DRAWING A LONG BREATH WHEN I REACHED HOME AFTER LEAVING YOU I FOUND A LETTER FOR ME POSTMARKED NEW YORK CITY FOR AN INSTANT I THOUGHT IT WAS FROM MY FATHER BUT THE HAND WRITING WAS NOT HIS
THE LITTLE FOX AND THE ROOK WERE AS HAPPY AND BUSY AS THEY WERE AND THE ROBIN AND HIS MATE FLEW BACKWARD AND FORWARD LIKE TINY STREAKS OF LIGHTNING SOMETIMES THE ROOK FLAPPED HIS BLACK WINGS AND SOARED AWAY OVER THE TREE TOPS IN THE PARK
THIS ONE IS SMILED GRACE THEN HER FACE SOBERED INSTANTLY I HOPE NO ONE ELSE BESIDES OURSELVES FINDS OUT
WAIT I'LL GO TO THE CORNER WITH YOU SAID GRACE SLIPPING INTO HER COAT AND THROWING A SILK SCARF OVER HER HEAD
AND THAT HIS DECISIONS WERE TO BE STRAIGHT AND STAINLESS LIKE THE WAND SEVERAL OTHER FORMS HAD TO BE GONE THROUGH TILL THE CEREMONY WAS COMPLETED AND HE WAS THEN THE LAWFUL KING
EACH TIME HE CAME BACK AND PERCHED NEAR DICKON
GET OUT OF THE ROOM HE SHOUTED
I HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN REPLIED ANNE GRAVELY I KNEW THAT NOTHING COULD INDUCE ME TO REFUSE SO I SETTLED THE MATTER AT ONCE CONFESS YOU BAD CHILD
HAD LITTLE IN COMMON WITH HER USUAL DRAWL SHE AND HER FAITHFUL ARAB HAD THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE ATTEMPTS OF THE VARIOUS GIRLS TO DISCOVER WHO WAS INSIDE THE GREAT HEAD AND VOLUMINOUS DRAPERY
AND PULLED THE PINS FROM HER HAT I JUST COULDN'T WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT
AND SHE SAW NO REASON WHY AN ILL TEMPERED BOY SHOULD INTERFERE WITH THE THING SHE LIKED BEST SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE PITIFULNESS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN ILL AND NERVOUS AND WHO DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY COULD CONTROL THEIR TEMPERS
THIS GRIEVED THE TENDER HEART OF HIS PRETTY DAUGHTER WHO LOVED HIM DEARLY AND WAS THE COMFORT OF HIS LIFE PETER WAS THINKING OF HER AS HE SAT IN THE INN KITCHEN AND HEARD THE SHEPHERDS TALKING ABOUT THE BURIED TREASURE
IF ONLY HE COULD COME BACK AGAIN HERE WE ARE ROLLING IN RICHES WHILE HE MAY BE NIBBLING AT HUNGER'S TABLE AND THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH A THING MADE HER WEEP
CONSIDERED NOT IN ITSELF BUT AS ORDAINED TO THE GOOD OF THE UNIVERSE
AS THE EARTH HAS OF PRODUCING PLANTS WHEREFORE SCRIPTURE DOES NOT SAY LET THE FIRMAMENT PRODUCE LIGHTS THOUGH IT SAYS LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH THE GREEN HERB REPLY
RECEIVED ITS FORM THE LIGHTS THEREFORE
I SHOULD NOT BE SORRY MYSELF TO SEE HIM COME BACK THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING LACKING IN A HOUSE WHEN THE GOOD MAN IS AWAY BUT THE FACT WAS THAT SHE WAS GROWING QUITE TIRED OF HAVING NO ONE TO SCOLD
TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL THE INTERMEDIATE ELEMENT FOR THEY MOVE IN AIR AND WATER
WHERE ADDERS AND SERPENTS LODGE BUT OPEN THE FAST CLOSED DOOR BY MEANS OF THE WELL KNOWN SPRING ROOT WHICH YOU MUST ON NO ACCOUNT FORGET TO TAKE WITH YOU OR ALL YOUR TROUBLE WILL BE FOR NAUGHT FOR NO CROWBAR OR MORTAL TOOLS WILL HELP YOU
NAMELY THE HEAVEN THE WATER AND THE EARTH
I DO NOT DESIRE YOUR TREASURES AT THIS THE SPECTRE GRINNED IN MY FACE AND CRIED MOCKINGLY SIMPLETON DO YOU SCORN YOUR GOOD FORTUNE WELL THEN REMAIN A RAGAMUFFIN ALL YOUR DAYS HE TURNED AS IF TO GO AWAY FROM ME
BUT BEWARE HOW YOU STRETCH OUT A HAND TOWARDS THE JEWELS IN THE MIDST OF THE CAVERN STANDS A COPPER CHEST IN THAT YOU WILL FIND GOLD AND SILVER
THAT NO ONE COULD EVER TELL ME WHERE THE SPRING ROOT WAS TO BE FOUND THEN BLAIZE ANOTHER AGED SHEPHERD LIFTED UP HIS VOICE TIS A PITY FATHER MARTIN THAT YOUR SECRET HAS GROWN OLD WITH YOU
HE TOOK WITH HIM ONLY A STAFF A STRONG SACK AND A LITTLE BOX WHICH HIS DAUGHTER LUCIA HAD GIVEN HIM IT HAPPENED THAT ON THE VERY DAY PETER HAD CHOSEN FOR SETTING OUT LUCIA AND HER MOTHER WENT OFF EARLY TO THE TOWN LEAVING HIM TO GUARD THE HOUSE
FURTHER THE LIGHTS ARE FIXED IN THE FIRMAMENT AS PLANTS ARE FIXED IN THE EARTH FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS HE SET THEM IN THE FIRMAMENT BUT PLANTS ARE DESCRIBED AS PRODUCED WHEN THE EARTH TO WHICH THEY ARE ATTACHED
WHICH HAVING ATTAINED IT RESTS THIS DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE MOVEMENT OF HEAVENLY BODIES HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY ARE MOVED BY SOME INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCES AUGUSTINE APPEARS TO BE OF THE SAME OPINION WHEN HE EXPRESSES HIS BELIEF
HE HELD THE MAGIC ROOT TO THE KEYHOLE AND TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HEARD ALL THE SEVEN LOCKS CREAKING AND TURNING THE DOOR FLEW SUDDENLY WIDE OPEN AND HIS GREEDY WIFE'S STORE OF GOLD PIECES LAY BEFORE HIS EYES HE STOOD STILL IN SHEER AMAZEMENT
THOUGH SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER HAVING EVER SET EYES UPON HIM BEFORE HOWEVER SHE INVITED HIM TO STEP INTO THE HOUSE AND BE SEATED WHILE HE UNFOLDED HIS BUSINESS WITH A GREAT AIR OF MYSTERY HE BEGGED PERMISSION TO SPEAK TO THE FAIR LUCIA
WHICH THE HEATHENS FEAR THEREFORE THE HEAVENLY LIGHTS WERE NOT MADE TO BE SIGNS
ACCORDING AS ONE DAY IS HOTTER THAN ANOTHER ONE SEASON THAN ANOTHER AND ONE YEAR THAN ANOTHER ARE DUE TO CERTAIN PARTICULAR MOVEMENTS OF THE STARS WHICH MOVEMENTS MAY HAVE HAD THEIR BEGINNING ON THE FOURTH DAY
NOT KNOWING WHICH TO REJOICE OVER MOST THIS UNEXPECTED FIND OR THE PROOF OF THE MAGIC ROOT'S REAL POWER BUT AT LAST HE REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS QUITE TIME TO BE STARTING ON HIS JOURNEY
FURTHER THE DISTINCTION OF SEASONS AND DAYS BEGAN FROM THE FIRST DAY THEREFORE THE LIGHTS WERE NOT MADE
AND EVERY BEAM BUT LUCKILY MASTER PETER WAS NOT HANGING FROM ANY OF THEM AFTER THAT THE NEIGHBOURS WENT OUT WITH LONG POLES TO FISH IN EVERY DITCH AND POND BUT THEY FOUND NOTHING
WAS ALREADY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HANDSOME STRANGER AND QUITE WILLING TO BE HIS BRIDE BEFORE SHE HAD DONE STARING THIS HASTY WOOER HAD SMOOTHED HIS WAY BY COVERING THE SHINING TABLE WITH GOLD PIECES AS A WEDDING GIFT TO THE BRIDE'S MOTHER
IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE LIGHTS OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ON THE FOURTH DAY FOR THE HEAVENLY LUMINARIES ARE BY NATURE INCORRUPTIBLE BODIES WHEREFORE THEIR MATTER CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT THEIR FORM
WHICH IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ITS END YET FOR SOME OF THESE OPERATIONS AS SENSATION AND NUTRITION OUR BODY IS A NECESSARY INSTRUMENT HENCE IT IS CLEAR
DO NOT NEGLECT EACH TIME TO HEAP BACK THE LOOSE EARTH WHICH CONCEALED THE ENTRANCE OF THE KING'S TREASURE CHAMBER
ALWAYS HUNG ABOUT HER NECK MASTER PETER HAD NO CONTROL AT ALL OF THE MONEY AFFAIRS OF THE HOUSEHOLD SO THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECRET HOARD WERE QUITE UNKNOWN TO HIM AND THIS SEEMED TO BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR FINDING OUT WHAT THEY WERE
THIRDLY THAT OF THE SIXTH DAY AND FOURTHLY SUCH MATTERS AS BELONG TO THE SEVENTH DAY UNDER THE FIRST HEAD THERE ARE THREE POINTS OF INQUIRY ONE AS TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE LIGHTS TWO
WE ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIDDEN EFFECTS THROUGH THEIR SENSIBLE CAUSES AND CONVERSELY HENCE NOTHING PREVENTS A SENSIBLE CAUSE FROM BEING A SIGN BUT HE SAYS SIGNS RATHER THAN CAUSES TO GUARD AGAINST IDOLATRY
FURTHER AS ASTRONOMERS SAY THERE ARE MANY STARS LARGER THAN THE MOON THEREFORE THE SUN AND THE MOON ALONE ARE NOT CORRECTLY DESCRIBED AS THE TWO GREAT LIGHTS ON THE CONTRARY
OR FOR THE GLORY OF GOD OF THESE REASONS ONLY THAT WHICH POINTS OUT THE USEFULNESS OF THESE THINGS TO MAN IS TOUCHED UPON BY MOSES IN ORDER TO WITHDRAW HIS PEOPLE FROM IDOLATRY HENCE IT IS WRITTEN
HE EXPLAINS THIS SERVICE AT THE BEGINNING OF GENESIS AS THREEFOLD FIRST THE LIGHTS ARE OF SERVICE TO MAN IN REGARD TO SIGHT WHICH DIRECTS HIM IN HIS WORKS AND IS MOST USEFUL FOR PERCEIVING OBJECTS IN REFERENCE TO THIS HE SAYS
FURTHER PLANTS ARE AN EFFECT OF THE SUN MOON AND OTHER HEAVENLY BODIES NOW CAUSE PRECEDES EFFECT IN THE ORDER OF NATURE THE LIGHTS THEREFORE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ON THE FOURTH DAY BUT ON THE THIRD DAY
HAVE YOU NOT WASTED GOODS AND POSSESSIONS AND NOW DO YOU TALK OF MAKING A WILL AND SHE SEIZED HIM LIKE A FURY AND TRIED TO SCRATCH OUT HIS EYES BUT BY AND BY THE QUARREL WAS PATCHED UP AND EVERYTHING WENT ON AS BEFORE FROM THAT DAY
CERTAIN THINGS BELONG TO THE ADORNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE BY REASON OF THEIR PROPER MOVEMENT AND IN THIS WAY THE HEAVENLY LUMINARIES AGREE WITH OTHERS THAT CONDUCE TO THAT ADORNMENT FOR THEY ARE MOVED BY A LIVING SUBSTANCE
THE DAY FOR THE WEDDING WAS CHOSEN AND ALL THEIR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS WERE BIDDEN TO THE FEAST AS LUCIA WAS TRYING ON HER BRIDAL WREATH SHE SAID TO HER MOTHER THIS WEDDING GARLAND WOULD PLEASE ME INDEED IF FATHER PETER COULD LEAD ME TO THE CHURCH
DEEP UNDER THE EARTH AT TWILIGHT AND AT HIGH NOON IT IS HIDDEN BUT AT MIDNIGHT IT MAY BE DUG UP FOR SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS HAVE I WATCHED OVER IT BUT NOW
BUT IT HAS BEEN STATED ABOVE
FURTHER NOTHING IS MADE FOR THE SAKE OF THAT WHICH IS INFERIOR TO ITSELF
HIS CHOICE FELL UPON A WOMAN WHOSE EVIL TONGUE WAS WELL KNOWN IN THE TOWN
IN THE JOY OF HIS HEART PETER HAD TASTED FREELY OF HIS OWN GOOD WINE AND AS THE BRIDE HUNG UPON HIS ARM HE STUMBLED AND FELL DRAGGING HER DOWN WITH HIM WHEREUPON SHE BEAT HIM SOUNDLY AND THE NEIGHBOURS SAID TRULY THAT THINGS DID NOT PROMISE WELL FOR MASTER PETER'S COMFORT
LIGHT WAS GIVEN TO THE EARTH FOR THE SERVICE OF MAN WHO BY REASON OF HIS SOUL IS NOBLER THAN THE HEAVENLY BODIES NOR IS IT UNTRUE TO SAY THAT A HIGHER CREATURE MAY BE MADE FOR THE SAKE OF A LOWER
THAT THESE BODIES HAVE LIFE IS NOT A DIFFERENCE OF THINGS BUT OF WORDS
WHETHER THE LIGHTS OF HEAVEN ARE LIVING BEINGS
BUT IN SPITE OF THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF TAKING HIS DEPARTURE WHEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE AS WELL FIRST TO TEST THE MUCH VAUNTED POWERS OF THE MAGIC ROOT FOR HIMSELF
ON THE FIRST DAY OF THIS WORK WHICH IS THE FOURTH OF CREATION ARE PRODUCED THE LIGHTS TO ADORN THE HEAVEN BY THEIR MOVEMENTS ON THE SECOND DAY WHICH IS THE FIFTH BIRDS AND FISHES ARE CALLED INTO BEING
SOME DAY YOU WILL RUE THIS AND LOOKED AT ME SADLY THEN HE CRIED
WHICH PREVENT WEARINESS PRESERVE HEALTH AND PROVIDE FOR THE NECESSITIES OF FOOD ALL OF WHICH THINGS COULD NOT BE SECURED
WHEN THE MOON IS AT ITS PERFECTION IT RISES IN THE EVENING AND SETS IN THE MORNING AND THUS IT RULES THE NIGHT AND IT WAS PROBABLY MADE IN ITS FULL PERFECTION AS WERE PLANTS YIELDING SEED AS ALSO WERE ANIMALS AND MAN HIMSELF
THEN HE SAID CALMLY DO NOT BE ANNOYED DEAR WIFE I HAVE A GOOD PIECE OF BUSINESS IN HAND WHICH MAY TURN OUT WELL FOR US YOU WITH A GOOD BUSINESS
YET THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOON IS MORE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES IN THIS LOWER WORLD MOREOVER AS FAR AS THE SENSES ARE CONCERNED ITS APPARENT SIZE IS GREATER
IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH THEM
HE HAD A GARLAND UPON HIS HEAD AND A GIRDLE OF OAK LEAVES ABOUT HIS BODY AND CARRIED AN UPROOTED FIR TREE IN HIS RIGHT HAND
HOW IT IS TO BE FOUND THE EASIEST WAY TO GET IT IS BY THE HELP OF A BLACK WOODPECKER LOOK IN THE SPRING WHERE SHE BUILDS HER NEST IN A HOLE IN A TREE AND WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR HER BROOD TO FLY OFF
ONLY WONDERING HOW THE SACKS OF CORN WERE TO BE CARRIED TO THE MILL IN FUTURE SHE DECIDED TO BUY A STRONG ASS TO DO THE WORK AND HAVING CHOSEN ONE AND AFTER SOME BARGAINING WITH THE OWNER AS TO ITS PRICE SHE WENT TO THE CUPBOARD IN THE WALL TO FETCH THE MONEY
HIS MOTTO WAS IT WILL ALL COME RIGHT IN THE END BUT WHAT IT DID COME TO WAS RUIN FOR MASTER PETER HE WAS AT HIS WITS END TO KNOW HOW TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING FOR TRY AS HE MIGHT ILL LUCK SEEMED TO PURSUE HIM
AND NOT MERELY VIRTUALLY FOR THE FIRMAMENT
AND WHAT FRIEDLIN TOLD HER SEEMED TO MAKE LUCIA EVERY MOMENT MORE HAPPY AND CONTENTED
THE WRETCH MAY HAVE BEEN IDLING IN SOME TAVERN SINCE EARLY MORNING THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT STARTLED HER AND SHE FELT FOR HER KEYS SUPPOSE THEY HAD FALLEN INTO HER GOOD FOR NOTHING HUSBAND'S HANDS AND
AND THEN DART OFF TOWARDS THE SUN SETTING WHEN YOU SEE HER DO THIS TAKE A SCARLET CLOAK OR IF THAT BE LACKING TO YOU BUY A FEW YARDS OF SCARLET CLOTH AND HURRY BACK TO THE TREE BEFORE THE WOODPECKER RETURNS WITH THE SPRING ROOT IN HER BEAK
THEY LAUGHED IN HIS FACE AND RAN AWAY THIS WENT ON FOR SOME TIME BUT AT LAST ONE OF THE BOYS SPIED OUT A WOODPECKER IN THE MEADOW LANDS AMONG THE WOOD PIGEONS AND WHEN HE HAD FOUND HER NEST IN A HALF DEAD ALDER TREE CAME RUNNING TO PETER WITH THE NEWS OF HIS DISCOVERY
BLOCK UP THE ENTRANCE TO THE NEST WITH A HARD SOD AND LURK IN AMBUSH BEHIND THE TREE TILL THE BIRD RETURNS TO FEED HER NESTLINGS WHEN SHE PERCEIVES THAT SHE CANNOT GET INTO HER NEST SHE WILL FLY ROUND THE TREE UTTERING CRIES OF DISTRESS
LEST PERHAPS LIFTING UP THY EYES TO HEAVEN THOU SEE THE SUN AND THE MOON AND ALL THE STARS OF HEAVEN AND BEING DECEIVED BY ERROR THOU ADORE AND SERVE THEM WHICH THE LORD THY GOD CREATED FOR THE SERVICE OF ALL NATIONS NOW
IN SO FAR AS THE LIGHTS ARE SET IN THE HEAVENS TO INDICATE FAIR OR FOUL WEATHER AS FAVORABLE TO VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS AND IN THIS RESPECT HE SAYS LET THEM BE FOR SIGNS REPLY
SUFFICES THE AUTHORITY OF SCRIPTURE I ANSWER THAT IN RECAPITULATING THE DIVINE WORKS SCRIPTURE SAYS
AND EVERYTHING FELL OUT EXACTLY AS BLAIZE HAD FORETOLD AS SOON AS THE WOODPECKER CAME BACK WITH THE ROOT IN HER BEAK OUT RUSHED MASTER PETER FROM BEHIND THE TREE AND DISPLAYED THE FIERY RED CLOAK SO ADROITLY THAT THE TERRIFIED BIRD DROPPED THE ROOT JUST WHERE IT COULD BE EASILY SEEN
PETER SAVED UP EVERY PENNY THAT HIS DAUGHTER LUCIA GAVE HIM ON THE SLY AND BRIBED THE BOYS OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE TO SPY OUT A BLACK WOODPECKER'S NEST FOR HIM HE SENT THEM INTO THE WOODS AND FIELDS BUT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR A NEST THEY ONLY PLAYED PRANKS ON HIM
IN THE SECOND OR WORK OF DISTINCTION
CAN BE EXERCISED BY THE HEAVENLY BODIES FOR SUCH OPERATIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH A BODY NATURALLY INCORRUPTIBLE EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE IS IT THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SENSITIVE SOUL CAN APPERTAIN TO THE HEAVENLY BODY
BUT THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTELLECT WHICH DOES NOT ACT THROUGH THE BODY DO NOT NEED A BODY AS THEIR INSTRUMENT EXCEPT TO SUPPLY PHANTASMS THROUGH THE SENSES MOREOVER THE OPERATIONS OF THE SENSITIVE SOUL AS WE HAVE SEEN
AND MASTER PETER NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THEY KNOCKED AND CALLED BUT NOTHING STIRRED WITHIN BUT THE HOUSE CAT
AND REMORSE CAUSED HER THE GLOOMIEST FOREBODINGS AH LUCIA SHE CRIED
THAT SO RESPECTABLE A MAN AS PETER SHOULD BORROW HIS ROBE OF OFFICE AND WILLINGLY LENT IT TO HIM PETER NOW HAD ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE THE MAGIC ROOT HE STOPPED UP THE ENTRANCE TO THE NEST
THE PARTY HAD LISTENED WITH INTEREST TO THIS SPEECH BUT BY THE TIME IT WAS ENDED THE HOUR WAS LATE AND THEY WENT THEIR WAYS HOMEWARD
AND THERE STOOD FATHER PETER
FURTHER THE NEW MOON CANNOT BE SAID TO RULE THE NIGHT BUT SUCH IT PROBABLY DID WHEN FIRST MADE FOR MEN BEGIN TO COUNT FROM THE NEW MOON THE MOON THEREFORE WAS NOT MADE TO RULE THE NIGHT
THAT IS TO SAY ON THE SECOND DAY
SOMEONE KNOCKED AT DAME ILSE'S DOOR ONE DAY AND SHE WENT TO SEE IF IT WAS A CUSTOMER FOR MEAL BUT IN STEPPED A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN DRESSED LIKE A DUKE'S SON WHO GREETED HER RESPECTFULLY AND ASKED AFTER HER PRETTY DAUGHTER AS IF HE WERE AN OLD FRIEND
SO THAT HEAVEN WAS FORMED ON THE FIRST DAY ON THE SECOND DAY THE WATERS WERE SEPARATED AND ON THE THIRD DAY THE EARTH WAS DIVIDED INTO SEA AND DRY LAND SO ALSO IS IT IN THE WORK OF ADORNMENT
THOUGH WE SEARCHED AMONG THE BUSHES TILL NIGHT FELL AND THEN AS I DID NOT KNOW THE COUNTRY AND COULD NOT FIND MY WAY HOME IN THE DARK I DECIDED TO SLEEP UNDER A TREE
TAKE COURAGE FAINTHEARTED SHEPHERD
AND THUS FAR IS DEPENDENT ON THE BODY ALTHOUGH CAPABLE OF EXISTING APART FROM IT IT IS NOT HOWEVER POSSIBLE THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF NUTRITION GROWTH AND GENERATION THROUGH WHICH THE NUTRITIVE SOUL OPERATES
CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE HEAVENLY BODIES ACCORDINGLY THE UNION OF A SOUL TO A HEAVENLY BODY
AND YOU MAY HELP YOURSELF TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT IF YOU TAKE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN CARRY YOU WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT TO LAST YOUR LIFETIME AND YOU MAY RETURN THREE TIMES BUT WOE BETIDE YOU IF YOU VENTURE TO COME A FOURTH TIME
AND HE LOST ONE POST AFTER ANOTHER TILL AT LAST ALL HE COULD DO
THEREFORE THEY WERE NOT MADE TO ENLIGHTEN IT
AND AT THIS THOUGHT SHE BROKE OUT INTO LOUD LAMENTATIONS BUT HER MOTHER ONLY CRIED
ON THE CONTRARY SUFFICES THE AUTHORITY OF SCRIPTURE I ANSWER THAT
FURTHER THE LUMINARIES ARE AS IT WERE VESSELS OF LIGHT BUT LIGHT WAS MADE ON THE FIRST DAY THE LUMINARIES THEREFORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE FIRST DAY
HOWEVER AS THE MEETING WOULD BE UNDER HER OWN EYE SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
BETHINK YOURSELF BETHINK YOURSELF ROGUE I WILL FILL YOUR KNAPSACK I WILL FILL YOUR POUCH AWAY FROM ME MONSTER I ANSWERED I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU
TO THEIR PRODUCTION THE INTELLECT FOR EXAMPLE
EVEN WHEN THE ILL MATCHED COUPLE WERE PRESENTLY BLESSED WITH CHILDREN HIS HAPPINESS WAS BUT SHORT LIVED THE SAVAGE TEMPER OF HIS QUARRELSOME WIFE SEEMED TO BLIGHT THEM FROM THE FIRST
TO BE OF THE NATURE OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS FOR IT MAY BE SAID THAT THEY WERE FORMED OUT OF MATTER ALREADY EXISTING AS ANIMALS AND PLANTS WERE FORMED FOR THOSE HOWEVER WHO HOLD THE HEAVENLY BODIES TO BE OF ANOTHER NATURE FROM THE ELEMENTS AND NATURALLY INCORRUPTIBLE
HE CAREFULLY LOCKED THE EMPTY CUPBOARD AGAIN AND LEFT THE HOUSE WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY
ONE BEING MAY BE NOBLER THAN ANOTHER ABSOLUTELY BUT NOT IN A PARTICULAR RESPECT WHILE THEN IT IS NOT CONCEDED THAT THE SOULS OF HEAVENLY BODIES ARE NOBLER THAN THE SOULS OF ANIMALS ABSOLUTELY IT MUST BE CONCEDED THAT THEY ARE SUPERIOR TO THEM
WHICH RECEIVE LIFE FROM THE POWER OF THE SUN AND STARS MUCH MORE THEREFORE HAVE THE HEAVENLY BODIES A LIVING SOUL
THAT HE MIGHT NOT FORGET ANYTHING AND WHEN IT LAY CLEAR AND PLAIN BEFORE HIS EYES HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THOUGH HE MUST DO THE ROUGH WORK FOR HIS WIFE DURING ONE MORE WINTER AT LEAST HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO TREAD THE PATH TO THE MILL
IN AUGUSTINE'S OPINION THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY HERE FOR HE DOES NOT HOLD A SUCCESSION OF TIME IN THESE WORKS AND SO THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THE MATTER OF THE LIGHTS TO EXIST UNDER ANOTHER FORM
AND THEY SAT TILL MORNING WEEPING OVER THEIR OWN FANCIES AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT
I AM MAKING MY WILL SAID HE THAT WHEN MY HOUR COMES MY HOUSE MAY BE IN ORDER THESE UNEXPECTED WORDS CUT HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HEART SHE REMEMBERED THAT ALL NIGHT LONG SHE HAD DREAMED OF A NEWLY DUG GRAVE
SINCE THE HEAVENLY BODY IS A MOVER MOVED IT IS OF THE NATURE OF AN INSTRUMENT WHICH ACTS IN VIRTUE OF THE AGENT AND THEREFORE SINCE THIS AGENT IS A LIVING SUBSTANCE THE HEAVENLY BODY CAN IMPART LIFE IN VIRTUE OF THAT AGENT
LET HIM FIND IT WHO CAN SO I THOUGHT TO GIVE IT INTO YOUR HAND HAVING A KINDNESS FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU FEED YOUR FLOCK UPON MY MOUNTAIN THEREUPON THE SPECTRE TOLD ME EXACTLY WHERE THE TREASURE LAY AND HOW TO FIND IT
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE HEAVENLY BODIES ARE NOT LIVING BEINGS IN THE SAME SENSE AS PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND THAT IF THEY ARE CALLED SO IT CAN ONLY BE EQUIVOCALLY IT WILL ALSO BE SEEN THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THOSE WHO AFFIRM AND THOSE WHO DENY
SO ENDED THE SHEPHERD'S TALE
AFTER WHICH THE DAME MADE NO DIFFICULTIES AND THE MATTER WAS SPEEDILY SETTLED
WE MUST NEXT CONSIDER THE WORK OF ADORNMENT FIRST AS TO EACH DAY BY ITSELF SECONDLY AS TO ALL SEVEN DAYS IN GENERAL IN THE FIRST PLACE THEN WE CONSIDER THE WORK OF THE FOURTH DAY SECONDLY THAT OF THE FIFTH DAY
THAT THE SENSITIVE AND NUTRITIVE SOULS MUST BE UNITED TO A BODY IN ORDER TO EXERCISE THEIR FUNCTIONS THERE ARE HOWEVER OPERATIONS OF THE SOUL WHICH ARE NOT EXERCISED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE BODY THOUGH THE BODY MINISTERS AS IT WERE
THE NOISE IS CAUSED BY THE POWER OF THE MAGIC ROOT AND YOU WILL NOT BE HURT NOW TRIM YOUR LAMP THAT IT MAY NOT FAIL YOU FOR YOU WILL BE NEARLY BLINDED BY THE FLASH AND GLITTER OF THE GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES ON THE WALLS AND PILLARS OF THE VAULT
NO DEAREST GIRL ANSWERED HE I AM COME TO COMPLETE YOUR HAPPINESS AND MY OWN SINCE WE LAST MET MY FORTUNE HAS UTTERLY CHANGED I AM NO LONGER THE POOR VAGABOND THAT I WAS THEN
FOR SHE HAD SOME ILL WORD FOR EVERYONE THEREFORE WHEN MASTER PETER CAME ALONG AND LET HIMSELF BE TAKEN IN BY HER BOASTED SKILL AS A HOUSEWIFE SHE JUMPED AT HIS OFFER AND THEY WERE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY BUT THEY HAD NOT GOT HOME BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL
BY THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT FROM THE BEGINNING
BUT WHAT WERE HER FEELINGS WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT EVERY SHELF LAY EMPTY AND BARE BEFORE HER FOR A MOMENT SHE STOOD BEWILDERED THEN BROKE INTO SUCH FRIGHTFUL RAVINGS THAT LUCIA RAN TO HER IN ALARM
BUT AS I DID NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT
SO THERE WILL BE NO FRUIT TO GROW RIPE BUT BY AND BY HE HAD A LITTLE DAUGHTER SO STRONG AND HEALTHY THAT NEITHER HER MOTHER'S TEMPER NOR HER FATHER'S SPOILING COULD KEEP HER FROM GROWING UP TALL AND BEAUTIFUL
PETER COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND WENT QUICKLY TO SEE FOR HIMSELF IF IT WAS REALLY TRUE AND WHEN HE REACHED THE TREE THERE CERTAINLY WAS A BIRD FLYING IN AND OUT AS IF SHE HAD A NEST IN IT PETER WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS FORTUNATE DISCOVERY
WHETHER THE CAUSE ASSIGNED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE LIGHTS IS REASONABLE OBJECTION ONE
AND THAT ON THE FOURTH DAY THE LIGHTS RECEIVED A DEFINITE POWER TO PRODUCE DETERMINATE EFFECTS THUS WE OBSERVE THAT THE RAYS OF THE SUN HAVE ONE EFFECT THOSE OF THE MOON ANOTHER AND SO FORTH HENCE SPEAKING
FURTHER SIGN IS CONTRADISTINGUISHED FROM CAUSE BUT THE LIGHTS ARE THE CAUSE OF WHAT TAKES PLACE UPON THE EARTH THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT SIGNS
A CAUSE IS NOBLER THAN ITS EFFECT BUT THE SUN MOON AND STARS ARE A CAUSE OF LIFE AS IS ESPECIALLY EVIDENCED IN THE CASE OF ANIMALS
THEY LED HIM MILES OVER HILL AND VALE STOCK AND STONE TO FIND A RAVEN'S BROOD
THEN THE HOUSE WAS SEARCHED FROM GARRET TO CELLAR BUT NO MASTER PETER WAS TO BE FOUND WHO KNOWS
IN REFERENCE TO THIS HE SAYS LET THEM BE FOR SEASONS AND FOR DAYS AND YEARS THIRDLY AS REGARDS THE CONVENIENCE OF BUSINESS AND WORK
MASTER PETER BLOCH HAD ONCE BEEN A PROSPEROUS INNKEEPER AND A MASTER COOK BUT HE HAD GONE STEADILY DOWN IN THE WORLD FOR SOME TIME AND WAS NOW QUITE POOR FORMERLY HE HAD BEEN A MERRY FELLOW
SO SOON AS SHE TOUCHES WITH THE ROOT THE SOD THAT BLOCKS THE NEST IT WILL FLY VIOLENTLY OUT OF THE HOLE THEN SPREAD THE RED CLOTH QUICKLY UNDER THE TREE SO THAT THE WOODPECKER MAY THINK IT IS A FIRE AND IN HER TERROR DROP THE ROOT SOME PEOPLE REALLY LIGHT A FIRE AND
THOSE THINGS THAT BELONG TO THEM INTRINSICALLY BUT THE ADORNMENT THOSE THAT ARE EXTRINSIC JUST AS THE PERFECTION OF A MAN LIES IN HIS PROPER PARTS AND FORMS AND HIS ADORNMENT IN CLOTHING OR SUCH LIKE
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SOON HE HEARD HIS WIFE'S HARSH VOICE SINGING ITS MORNING SONG AS SHE WENT ABOUT HER HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS SCOLDING HER DAUGHTER THE WHILE SHE BURST OPEN HIS DOOR WHILE HE WAS STILL DRESSING WELL TOPER WAS HER GREETING
THE HEAVEN IS SAID TO MOVE ITSELF IN AS FAR AS IT IS COMPOUNDED OF MOVER AND MOVED NOT BY THE UNION OF THE MOVER AS THE FORM WITH THE MOVED AS THE MATTER BUT BY CONTACT WITH THE MOTIVE POWER AS WE HAVE SAID
THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES ARE NATURAL NOT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR ACTIVE PRINCIPLE BUT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR PASSIVE PRINCIPLE THAT IS TO SAY FROM A CERTAIN NATURAL APTITUDE FOR BEING MOVED BY AN INTELLIGENT POWER
THOUGH MASTER PETER HAD NO GREAT WEALTH TO LEAVE BEHIND HIM STILL IT WAS SAD TO HIM TO BE CHILDLESS AND HE WOULD BEMOAN HIMSELF TO HIS FRIENDS WHEN HE LAID ONE BABY AFTER ANOTHER IN THE GRAVE SAYING THE LIGHTNING HAS BEEN AMONG THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS AGAIN
WHEN YOU FIND THIS HOLLOW DIG IT OUT BUT IT WILL BE HARD WORK FOR THE EARTH HAS BEEN PRESSED DOWN INTO IT WITH CARE STILL WORK AWAY TILL YOU FIND SOLID ROCK ON ALL SIDES OF YOU AND SOON YOU WILL COME TO A SQUARE SLAB OF STONE
FOND OF A JOKE AND IN THE ART OF COOKING HAD NO EQUAL IN THE TOWN HE COULD MAKE FISH JELLY AND QUINCE FRITTERS AND EVEN WAFER CAKES AND HE GILDED THE EARS OF ALL HIS BOARS HEADS PETER HAD LOOKED ABOUT HIM FOR A WIFE EARLY IN LIFE BUT UNLUCKILY
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG LAD I HAD NO HOME AND NO ONE TO CARE FOR ME AND I WANDERED FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WITH MY KNAPSACK ON MY BACK
IT COST MASTER PETER MANY STRUGGLES BEFORE HE COULD BRING HIMSELF TO VISIT SUCH A PERSON BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT AND LITTLE AS HE LIKED IT
WITH REGARD TO THEIR RESPECTIVE FORMS SINCE THEIR FORM PERFECTS THEIR MATTER ENTIRELY WHICH IS NOT IN POTENTIALITY TO OTHER FORMS WHEREAS A SOUL DOES NOT DO THIS ALSO AS REGARDS MOVEMENT THE POWER THAT MOVES THE HEAVENLY BODIES IS OF A NOBLER KIND
SO THAT I DARE TO PRESENT MYSELF TO YOUR MOTHER AS A SUITOR FOR YOUR HAND THAT I LOVE YOU I KNOW WELL IF YOU CAN LOVE ME I AM INDEED A HAPPY MAN LUCIA'S PRETTY BLUE EYES HAD LOOKED UP SHYLY AS HE SPOKE
OF WHOSE SKILL IN NEEDLEWORK HE HAD HEARD SO MUCH
WHICH IN A WAY OBLIGES ALL TO FOLLOW WHERE SOME LEAD I TRUST
SO THAT A FLOWER MAY POSSESS FEATURES OR QUALITIES THAT ENDOW IT WITH THE HIGHEST BEAUTY BUT THAT EXCLUDE IT BECAUSE THE HARD AND NARROW LIMITS OF THE SHOW LAWS PROVIDE NO MEANS OF DEALING WITH IT IT IS THEREFORE THROWN OUT
NOW BEING FOLLOWED BY COLOURED ONES OF THE SAME HABIT SEEMS TO ME WORTHY OF NOTHING BUT CONDEMNATION IT WOULD BE AS RIGHT AND SENSIBLE TO DWARF A HOLLYHOCK INTO A PODGY MASS A FOOT HIGH
A SHEPHERD BOY TENDED HIS MASTER'S SHEEP NEAR A DARK FOREST NOT FAR FROM THE VILLAGE SOON HE FOUND LIFE IN THE PASTURE VERY DULL ALL HE COULD DO
AND NOT ANYTHING OF THE NATURE OF FASHION OR FANCY AND THAT EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TOWARDS THE RAISING RATHER THAN THE LOWERING OF THE STANDARD OF TASTE THE SOCIETIES WHICH EXIST THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ARE WELL ORGANISED
WHEN THEIR CLUSTERED HEADS OF FLOWER WOULD BE GIVEN ENOUGH ROOM AND BE SEEN TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE BUT AT SHOWS THE TRIUMPH OF THE TRAINING ART SEEMS TO BE TO DRAG THE POOR THING ROUND AND ROUND
THAT IT IS RIGHT AND LAUDABLE TO DEVOTE TO IT MUCH TIME AND DELICATE WORKMANSHIP I CANNOT BUT THINK AS WELL AS HOPE THAT THE STRONG INFLUENCES FOR GOOD THAT ARE NOW BEING BROUGHT TO BEAR ON ALL DEPARTMENTS OF GARDENING
WHAT CANNOT FAIL TO BE DEBASING TO PUBLIC TASTE I WILL JUST TAKE TWO EXAMPLES TO SHOW HOW OBVIOUS METHODS OF LEADING TASTE ARE NOT ONLY OVERLOOKED BUT EVEN PERVERTED
IF THEY WILL LIE QUITE FLAT AND SHOW AN OUTLINE OF A PERFECT CIRCLE ALL THAT IS MOST BEAUTIFUL IN A PANSY THE WING LIKE CURVES THE WAVED OR SLIGHTLY FLUTED RADIATIONS THE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE
THE RED ALSO IS OF A RATHER DULL AND HEAVY NATURE SO THAT INSTEAD OF A HANDSOME YELLOW FLOWER WITH A BROAD CENTRAL RING HERE IS AN UGLY RED ONE WITH A YELLOW BORDER THERE IS NO POSITIVE HARM DONE
HOW USELESS IS THE PLANE SAID ONE OF THEM IT BEARS NO FRUIT WHATEVER AND ONLY SERVES TO LITTER THE GROUND WITH LEAVES UNGRATEFUL CREATURES
FOR IT IS NOT ONLY IN THE INDIVIDUAL BLOOMS THAT MUCH OF THE SHOW TEACHING IS UNWORTHY BUT ALSO IN THE TRAINING OF THE PLANTS SO THAT A PLANT THAT BY NATURE HAS SOME BEAUTY OF FORM
FOR MANY OF THE SHOW SORTS HAVE MISERABLY WEAK STALKS AND A VERY POOR LANKY HABIT OF GROWTH THEN THE POOR PANSIES HAVE SINGLE BLOOMS LAID FLAT ON WHITE PAPERS AND ARE ONLY APPROVED
THOUGH HE HAD NOT SEEN ANYTHING THAT EVEN LOOKED LIKE A WOLF HE RAN TOWARD THE VILLAGE SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE WOLF WOLF AS HE EXPECTED THE VILLAGERS WHO HEARD THE CRY
OR A FOXGLOVE HAPPILY THESE HAVE AS YET ESCAPED DWARFING THOUGH I REGRET TO SEE THAT A DEFORMITY THAT NOT UNFREQUENTLY APPEARS AMONG GARDEN FOXGLOVES LOOKING LIKE A BELL SHAPED FLOWER
NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ANY FAULT TO FIND WITH IT BUT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONCERN THEM AND THE ORDINARY GARDENER TO WHOSE PRACTICE IT MIGHT BE OF THE HIGHEST VALUE ACCEPTING THE VERDICT OF THE SHOW JUDGE AS AN INFALLIBLE GUIDE
AND THOSE WHO FRAME THE SCHEDULES HAVE BEEN IN MOST CASES MEN WHO HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF FLOWERS BUT WHO ARE NOT PEOPLE OF CULTIVATED TASTE AND IN DECIDING WHAT POINTS ARE TO CONSTITUTE THE MERITS OF A FLOWER
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE NOVELTY AND VARIETY WHEN I LOOK BACK OVER THIRTY YEARS OF GARDENING I SEE WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS THERE HAS BEEN NOT ONLY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF GOOD PLANTS NEW TO GENERAL CULTIVATION
THE BOY RAN TOWARD THE VILLAGE SHOUTING WOLF WOLF BUT THOUGH THE VILLAGERS HEARD THE CRY THEY DID NOT RUN TO HELP HIM AS THEY HAD BEFORE HE CANNOT FOOL US AGAIN
ALSO TREATS IT WITH CONTEMPT AND NEGLECT NOW ALL THIS WOULD NOT SO MUCH MATTER IF IT DID NOT DELUDE THOSE WHOSE TASTE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY EDUCATED TO ENABLE THEM TO FORM AN OPINION OF THEIR OWN
NOR HAVE I EVER SEEN ELSEWHERE ANY THAT I THINK CAN COMPARE WITH IT
IF NOT ABSOLUTELY HARMFUL SHOWS OF CARNATIONS AND PANSIES WHERE THE OLDER RULES PREVAIL ARE EQUALLY MISLEADING
SOME DAYS LATER WHILE STALKING HIS PREY IN THE FOREST THE LION WAS CAUGHT IN THE TOILS OF A HUNTER'S NET UNABLE TO FREE HIMSELF HE FILLED THE FOREST WITH HIS ANGRY ROARING
FOR THE PODGY LITTLE DWARF SNAPDRAGONS THEY ARE UNGRACEFUL LITTLE DUMPY THINGS
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME REPLIED THE BULL I DID NOT EVEN KNOW YOU WERE THERE WE ARE OFTEN OF GREATER IMPORTANCE IN OUR OWN EYES
CAN IT BE REALLY TO TEACH WITH DELIBERATE INTENTION THAT INSTEAD OF DISPLAYING ITS NATURAL AND GRACEFUL TREE FORM IT SHOULD AIM AT A MORE DESIRABLE KIND OF BEAUTY SUCH AS THAT OF THE CHIMNEY POT OR DRAIN PIPE AND THAT THIS IS SO IMPORTANT
BUT ALSO IN THE HOME PRODUCTION OF IMPROVED KINDS OF OLD FAVOURITES
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BEST AND TRUEST STANDARDS OF BEAUTY FOR I VENTURE TO REPEAT THAT WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR GARDENS AND FOR OUR OWN BETTERING AND INCREASE OF HAPPINESS IN THOSE GARDENS ARE THINGS THAT ARE BEAUTIFUL
AND SEEMING TO SAY WE WERE REALLY A GOOD BIT MILDEWED BUT HAVE BEEN DOCTORED UP FOR THE SHOW BY BEING CRAMMED AND STUFFED WITH ARTIFICIAL ALIMENT MY SECOND EXAMPLE IS THAT OF AZALEA INDICA
THAT IS INCREASED BY DIVISION AS WELL AS BY SEED
THE MOUSE KNEW THE VOICE AND QUICKLY FOUND THE LION STRUGGLING IN THE NET RUNNING TO ONE OF THE GREAT ROPES THAT BOUND HIM SHE GNAWED IT UNTIL IT PARTED AND SOON THE LION WAS FREE
AS THE PLANT HAS BEEN PROPAGATED AT EVERY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AND ONE MAY CHOOSE WHAT ONE WILL BUT TO SEE THEM TOGETHER IS AN INSTRUCTIVE LESSON NO ANNUAL PLANT
FOR ALL THESE FALSE GODS ARE AMONG US
AS WITH THE CHRYSANTHEMUM EVERY SORT OF TRICKERY IS ALLOWED IN ARRANGING THE PETALS OF THE CARNATION BLOOMS PETALS ARE PULLED OUT OR STUCK IN AND THEY ARE TWISTED ABOUT AND GROOMED AND COMBED AND MANIPULATED WITH SPECIAL TOOLS
NOT FOR VARIETY OR NOVELTY AS ENDS IN THEMSELVES BUT ONLY TO WELCOME THEM AND OFFER THEM IF THEY ARE DISTINCTLY OF GARDEN VALUE IN THE BEST SENSE FOR IF PLANTS ARE GROWN OR ADVERTISED OR OTHERWISE PUSHED
AND RIGID ARRANGEMENT AND COMPUTATION THAT ONE WOULD THINK MORE APPLICABLE TO ASTRONOMY OR GEOMETRY THAN TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO HORTICULTURE I DO MOST STRONGLY URGE THAT BEAUTY OF THE HIGHEST CLASS SHOULD BE THE AIM
AND AT THE LONDON SHOWS THERE ARE NOW CLASSES FOR BORDER CARNATIONS SET UP IN LONG STALKED BUNCHES JUST AS THEY GROW IT IS ONLY LIKE THIS THAT THEIR VALUE AS OUTDOOR PLANTS CAN BE TESTED
THERE HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE ADVANCE AND HERE AGAIN THOUGH MANY REALLY BEAUTIFUL THINGS ARE BEING BROUGHT FORWARD THERE SEEMS ALWAYS TO BE AN UNDUE VALUE ASSIGNED TO A FRESH DEVELOPMENT ON THE SCORE OF ITS NOVELTY
MAY REACH THIS CLASS OF SHOW FOR THERE ARE ALREADY MORE HOPEFUL SIGNS IN THE ADMISSION OF CLASSES FOR GROUPS ARRANGED FOR DECORATION THE PRIZE SHOW SYSTEM NO DOUBT CREATES ITS OWN EVILS BECAUSE THE JUDGES
THAT DISPLAYS TO PERFECTION THE ADMIRABLE DELICACY OF VELVETY TEXTURE ALL THE LITTLE TENDER TRICKS AND WAYS THAT MAKE THE PANSY ONE OF THE BEST LOVED OF GARDEN FLOWERS ALL THIS IS OVERLOOKED
AS THE SUN WAS SETTING BEHIND THE FOREST AND THE SHADOWS WERE CREEPING OUT OVER THE PASTURE A WOLF REALLY DID SPRING FROM THE UNDERBRUSH AND FALL UPON THE SHEEP IN TERROR
DOES THIS REALLY HELP THE BEST INTERESTS OF HORTICULTURE AND AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THAT IT DOES THIS I THINK THE SHOW RIGHT AND HELPFUL AND WHENEVER IT DOES NOT I THINK IT HARMFUL AND MISLEADING
HE MADE READY TO FLY AWAY BUT BEFORE HE LEFT HE BEGGED THE BULL'S PARDON FOR HAVING USED HIS HORN FOR A RESTING PLACE YOU MUST BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE ME GO NOW HE SAID
AS TO KEEP IN VIEW THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND AS A POINT OF HONOUR NOT TO MERE INCREASE OF SIZE OF BLOOM OR COMPACTNESS OF HABIT MANY PLANTS HAVE BEEN SPOILT BY EXCESS OF BOTH
WHEN THIS KIND CAME OUT IT WAS A NOTEWORTHY NOVELTY NOT BECAUSE IT WAS A NOVELTY BUT BECAUSE IT WAS A BETTER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THING
WHOSE RED AND PINK COLOURINGS HAD HITHERTO BEEN OF A BAD AND RANK QUALITY IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT HERE AND THERE THE DWARF KIND IS A DISTINCTLY USEFUL THING
AND OF BRIGHTENING OUR HOMES AND EVEN GARDENS DURING THE DIM DAYS OF EARLY WINTER ARE TEASED AND TORTURED AND FATTED AND BLOATED INTO UGLY AND USELESS MONSTROSITIES FOR NO PURPOSE BUT TO GAIN MONEY
THAT WE CAN HAVE IN TREE SHAPE IN A MODERATE SIZED POT AND WHERE ELSE CAN ONE SEE A TREE LOADED WITH LOVELY BLOOM WHOSE INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS HAVE A DIAMETER EQUAL TO FIVE TIMES THAT OF THE TRUNK
AND MUCH AS I FEEL GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO IMPROVE GARDEN FLOWERS I VENTURE TO REPEAT MY STRONG CONVICTION THAT THEIR EFFORTS IN SELECTION AND OTHER METHODS SHOULD BE SO DIRECTED
THAN IN THE EYES OF OUR NEIGHBOR THE SMALLER THE MIND
TRAINED IN THIS MANNER SUCH A SIGHT GIVES ME A FEELING OF SHAME NOT UNMIXED WITH WRATHFUL INDIGNATION I ASK MYSELF WHAT IS IT FOR
THEY SAID THE WOLF KILLED A GREAT MANY OF THE BOY'S SHEEP AND THEN SLIPPED AWAY INTO THE FOREST LIARS ARE NOT BELIEVED EVEN WHEN THEY SPEAK THE TRUTH
I AM OF OPINION THAT THE SHOW TABLE IS UNWORTHILY USED WHEN ITS OBJECT IS TO BE AN END IN ITSELF AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ONLY A MEANS TO A BETTER END AND THAT WHEN IT EXHIBITS WHAT HAS BECOME MERELY A FANCY
FLORISTS FLOWERS BY WHICH I MEAN THOSE THAT FIND FAVOUR IN THE EXCLUSIVE SHOWS OF SOCIETIES FOR THE GROWING AND EXHIBITION OF SUCH FLOWERS AS TULIPS CARNATIONS DAHLIAS AND CHRYSANTHEMUMS IN SUPPORT OF THIS I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
IN THIS GRAND PLANT ONE IS GLAD TO HAVE DWARF ONES AS WELL AS THE OLD TRAILING KINDS
BUT WHICH IS NEVERTHELESS BEING PUSHED FORWARD IN TRADE IT HAS NO MERIT WHATEVER IN ITSELF AND IS ONLY LIKELY TO SELL BECAUSE IT IS NEW AND CURIOUS AND ALL THIS PARADE OF DISTORTION AND DEFORMITY
MANY HAVE EXISTED FOR A GREAT NUMBER OF YEARS THEY ARE THE LOCAL SOURCES OF HORTICULTURAL EDUCATION TO WHICH LARGE CIRCLES OF PEOPLE NATURALLY LOOK FOR GUIDANCE AND THOUGH THEY PRODUCE AND ESPECIALLY THE ROSE SHOWS
WHOSE OBJECT IS TO BRING TOGETHER BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS OF ALL KINDS TO A PLACE WHERE THEY MAY BE SEEN ARE OF THE UTMOST VALUE AND THAT ANY SHOWS ANYWHERE FOR A LIKE PURPOSE AND ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE ARE NO MONEY PRIZES
TO AMUSE HIMSELF WAS TO TALK TO HIS DOG OR PLAY ON HIS SHEPHERD'S PIPE ONE DAY AS HE SAT WATCHING THE SHEEP AND THE QUIET FOREST AND THINKING WHAT HE WOULD DO SHOULD HE SEE A WOLF
ALL IDEA OF GARDEN DELIGHT SEEMS TO BE EXCLUDED AS THIS KIND OF JUDGING APPEALS TO NO RECOGNITION OF BEAUTY FOR BEAUTY'S SAKE BUT TO HARD SYSTEMS OF MEASUREMENT
WHEREAS A REASONABLY DOUBLE ONE WELL BRANCHED AND TWO FEET HIGH IS A HANDSOME PLANT I ALSO THINK THAT STOCKS AND WALLFLOWERS ARE MUCH HANDSOMER WHEN RATHER TALL AND BRANCHING DWARF STOCKS MOREOVER
AND IN NOT KNOWING WHEN OR WHERE TO STOP ABNORMAL SIZE WHETHER GREATLY ABOVE OR MUCH BELOW THE AVERAGE APPEALS TO THE VULGAR AND UNEDUCATED EYE AND WILL ALWAYS COMMAND ITS ATTENTION AND WONDERMENT
NO USE ANYWHERE BUT ON THAT BOARD AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF GAINING A MONEY PRIZE I HOLD THAT THE SHOW TABLE HAS A DEBASED AIM AND A DEBASING INFLUENCE BEAUTY
IT LOSES SIGHT OF ITS HONOURABLE POSITION AS A TRUSTWORTHY EXPONENT OF HORTICULTURE AND HAS DEGENERATED TO A BASER USE WHEN AS IN CHRYSANTHEMUM SHOWS
WHAT IS PRETTIER IN A ROOM THAN ONE OF THESE IN ITS LITTLE TREE FORM A TRUE TREE WITH TINY TRUNK AND WIDE SPREADING BRANCHES AND ITS ABSURDLY LARGE AND LOVELY FLOWERS SURELY IT IS THE MOST PERFECT ROOM ORNAMENT
THE QUESTION IS BEYOND HIM AND HE SMILES VAGUELY AND EDGES AWAY EVIDENTLY THINKING MY CONVERSATION PERPLEXING AND MY COMPANY UNDESIRABLE
A GNAT FLEW OVER THE MEADOW WITH MUCH BUZZING FOR SO SMALL A CREATURE AND SETTLED ON THE TIP OF ONE OF THE HORNS OF A BULL AFTER HE HAD RESTED A SHORT TIME
DRESSED AS THE SHOW WORD HAS IT DRESSED SO ELABORATELY THAT THE DRESSING ONLY STOPS SHORT OF APPLYING ACTUAL PAINT AND PERFUMERY ALREADY IN THE CASE OF CARNATIONS A BETTER INFLUENCE IS BEING FELT
HAS OF LATE YEARS BEEN SO MUCH IMPROVED AS THE SWEET PEA AND ONE REASON WHY ITS CHARMING BEAUTY AND SCENT ARE SO ENJOYABLE IS THAT THEY GROW TALL AND CAN BE SEEN ON A LEVEL WITH THE EYE
THEY BECOME OF THE SAME NATURE AS ANY OTHER ARTICLE IN TRADE THAT IS GOT UP FOR SALE FOR THE SOLE BENEFIT OF THE SELLER THAT IS UNDULY LAUDED BY ADVERTISEMENT AND THAT MAKES ITS FIRST APPEAL TO THE VULGAR EYE
IS NOT ENCOURAGED OR EVEN ALLOWED TO DEVELOP THAT BEAUTY BUT IS TRAINED INTO SOME SHAPE THAT IS NOT ONLY FOREIGN TO ITS OWN NATURE BUT IS ABSOLUTELY UGLY AND UNGRACEFUL AND ENTIRELY STUPID
QUANTITIES OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS IT CANNOT BUT BE PERCEIVED BY ALL WHO HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF SOME REFINEMENT OF EDUCATION THAT IN VERY MANY CASES THEY EITHER DELIBERATELY TEACH OR AT ANY RATE ALLOW TO BE SEEN WITH THEIR SANCTION
THE SHEPHERD BOY AGAIN SHOUTED WOLF WOLF AGAIN THE VILLAGERS RAN TO HELP HIM ONLY TO BE LAUGHED AT AGAIN THEN ONE EVENING
BUT THE SHOW DECREES THAT ALL THIS IS WRONG AND THAT THE TINY BRITTLE BRANCHES MUST BE TRAINED STIFFLY ROUND TILL THE SHAPE OF THE PLANT SHOWS AS A SORT OF CYLINDER AGAIN I ASK MYSELF WHAT IS THIS FOR WHAT DOES IT TEACH
THE NATURAL HABIT OF THE CHRYSANTHEMUM IS TO GROW IN THE FORM OF SEVERAL UPRIGHT STEMS THEY SPRING UP SHEAF WISE STRAIGHT UPRIGHT FOR A TIME AND ONLY BENDING A LITTLE OUTWARDS ABOVE TO GIVE ROOM FOR THE BRANCHING HEADS OF BLOOM
IN ALL THE BEST SENSE IS PUT ASIDE IN FAVOUR OF SET RULES AND MEASUREMENTS AND THE PRODUCTION OF A THING THAT IS OF NO USE OR VALUE AND INDIVIDUALS OF A RACE OF PLANTS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE HIGHEST AND MOST DELIGHTFUL FORMS OF BEAUTY
AND NOT ONLY PASSIVELY OVERLOOKED BUT OVERTLY CONTEMNED THE SHOW PANSY JUDGE APPEARS TO HAVE NO EYE OR BRAIN OR HEART BUT TO HAVE IN THEIR PLACE A PAIR OF COMPASSES WITH WHICH TO DESCRIBE A CIRCLE
HE THOUGHT OF A PLAN TO AMUSE HIMSELF HIS MASTER HAD TOLD HIM TO CALL FOR HELP SHOULD A WOLF ATTACK THE FLOCK AND THE VILLAGERS WOULD DRIVE IT AWAY SO NOW
BY AN EXAGGERATED AND SHOWY PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION THAT WILL SERVE NO USEFUL PURPOSE AND FOR WHICH THERE IS NO TRUE OR HEALTHY DEMAND NO DOUBT MUCH OF IT COMES ABOUT FROM THE UNWHOLESOME PRESSURE OF TRADE COMPETITION
OH IT IS ONE OF THE WAYS THEY ARE TRAINED FOR SHOWS I ASK HIM DOES HE THINK IT PRETTY OR IS IT ANY USE AND HE SAYS WELL THEY THINK IT MAKES A NICE VARIETY AND WHEN I PRESS HIM FURTHER
OR IN SOME SUCH WAY BETTER THAN AN OLDER THING OF THE SAME CLASS AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A GENERAL WISH AMONG SEED GROWERS JUST NOW TO DWARF ALL ANNUAL PLANTS
ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST INTERESTING AND ADMIRABLE OF GARDEN PLANTS
WITH A NARROW RING OF RED ROUND THE CENTRE THE IMPROVER HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE THE WIDTH OF THE RED RING UP TO A CERTAIN POINT IT MAKES A LIVELIER AND BRIGHTER LOOKING FLOWER BUT HE HAS GONE TOO FAR AND EXTENDED THE RED
THAT MY LIMITED CAPACITY IS WORTH AND BROADLY I HAVE COME TO THIS THAT SHOWS SUCH AS THOSE AT THE FORTNIGHTLY MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY AND THEIR MORE IMPORTANT ONE IN THE EARLY SUMMER
WHAT A SILLY LITTLE DUMPY FORMLESS PINCUSHION OF A THING IT IS AND THEN THE DWARFEST OF THE CHINA ASTERS HERE IS A PLANT WHOSE CHIEF WEAKNESS ALREADY LIES IN A CERTAIN OVER STIFFNESS MADE STIFFER
SO THAT EACH STEM MAY LEAN A LITTLE OVER
BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE PLANTS ARE INDIVIDUALLY MADE MUCH UGLIER BY THE PROCESS TAKE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE DWARFEST AGERATUMS
TOPPING A STUNTED SPIKE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FIXED AND IS BEING OFFERED AS A NOVELTY HERE IS ONE OF THE CLEAREST EXAMPLES OF A NEW DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS A DISTINCT DEBASEMENT OF A NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL FORM
IN INFERRING FROM THIS THAT ALL ANNUALS ARE THE BETTER FOR DWARFING I TAKE IT THAT THE BEDDING SYSTEM HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO WITH IT IT NO DOUBT ENABLES IGNORANT GARDENERS TO USE A LARGER VARIETY OF PLANTS
DROPPED THEIR WORK AND RAN IN GREAT EXCITEMENT TO THE PASTURE BUT WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY FOUND THE BOY DOUBLED UP WITH LAUGHTER AT THE TRICK HE HAD PLAYED ON THEM A FEW DAYS LATER
IN A SMALL GARDEN OF A TYPE THAT I THOUGHT EXTREMELY DESIRABLE WITH A DOUBLE FLOWER OF JUST THE RIGHT DEGREE OF FULNESS AND OF AN UNUSUALLY FINE COLOUR I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET SOME SEED
AND IN HER FRIGHT AND HASTE TO GET AWAY RAN ACROSS THE LION'S NOSE ROUSED FROM HIS NAP THE LION LAID HIS HUGE PAW ANGRILY ON THE TINY CREATURE TO KILL HER
ARE INVARIABLY SPATTERED WITH SOIL IN HEAVY AUTUMN RAIN AN EXAMPLE OF THE IMPROVER NOT KNOWING WHERE TO STOP IN THE MATTER OF COLOURING ALWAYS STRIKES ME IN THE GAILLARDIAS
THEY HAVE TO TAKE SUCH QUALITIES AS ARE WITHIN THE CLEAREST UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE OF AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE AND AVERAGE EDUCATION SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS SIZE THAT CAN BE MEASURED SYMMETRY THAT CAN BE EASILY ESTIMATED THICKNESS OF PETAL THAT CAN BE FELT
THE INTRODUCTION OF A BETTER CLASS OF RED COLOURING
THAT GIVE THEM A KIND OF ABSURD PRETTINESS AND A CERTAIN GARDEN VALUE I ALSO LOOK AT THEM AS A LITTLE FLORAL JOKE THAT IS HARMLESS AND NOT DISPLEASING
COMES ABOUT FROM THE GROWER LOSING SIGHT OF BEAUTY AS THE FIRST CONSIDERATION OR FROM HIS NOT HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE POINTS OF CHARACTER IN VARIOUS PLANTS MOST DESERVING OF DEVELOPMENT
SAID THE MOUSE NOW YOU SEE THAT EVEN A MOUSE CAN HELP A LION A KINDNESS
THE STEMS ARE RATHER STIFF BECAUSE THEY ARE HALF WOODY AT THE BASE IN THE CASE OF POT PLANTS IT WOULD SEEM RIGHT ONLY SO FAR TO STAKE OR TRAIN THEM AS TO GIVE THE NECESSARY SUPPORT
SAID A VOICE FROM THE PLANE TREE YOU LIE HERE IN MY COOLING SHADE AND YET YOU SAY I AM USELESS THUS UNGRATEFULLY O JUPITER DO MEN RECEIVE THEIR BLESSINGS
ARE ALSO SURE TO BE HELPFUL
WHEN A ZINNIA HAS A HARD STIFF TALL FLOWER WITH A GREAT MANY ROWS OF PETALS PILED UP ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER AND WHEN ITS HABIT IS DWARFED TO A MEAN DEGREE OF SQUATNESS IT LOOKS TO ME BOTH UGLY AND ABSURD
AND MORE SHAPELESS STILL BY DWARFING AND BY CRAMMING WITH TOO MANY PETALS THE COMET ASTERS OF LATER YEARS ARE A MUCH IMPROVED TYPE OF FLOWER WITH A LOOSER SHAPE AND A CERTAIN DEGREE OF APPROACH TO GRACE AND BEAUTY
MAY BE A DISTINCT GAIN TO HORTICULTURE IT MAY JUST MAKE A GOOD GARDEN PLANT OUT OF ONE THAT WAS FORMERLY OF INDIFFERENT QUALITY BUT THERE SEEMS TO ME TO BE A KIND OF STUPIDITY
BUT THEN THE PRODUCTION OF THE IMMENSE SIZE THAT PROVOKES ASTONISHMENT AND THE MISAPPLIED INGENUITY THAT PRODUCES UNUSUAL DWARFING ARE NEITHER OF THEM VERY HIGH AIMS
THERE CAN BE NO EXCUSE WHATEVER FOR DWARFING THIS AS HAS LATELY BEEN DONE THERE ARE ALREADY PLENTY OF GOOD FLOWERING PLANTS UNDER A FOOT HIGH AND THE LITTLE DWARF WHITE MONSTROSITY
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO UGLY
THE LOVE OF GARDENING HAS SO GREATLY GROWN AND SPREAD WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT THE NEED OF REALLY GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL GARDEN FLOWERS IS ALREADY FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE DEMAND FOR THE SO CALLED
BEING ALL BOUND IN A KIND OF BONDAGE TO THE GENERAL SYSTEM AND THERE IS ONE GREAT EVIL THAT CALLS LOUDLY FOR REDRESS
THE WORSHIP OF FALSE GODS SEVERAL TIMES DURING THESE NOTES I HAVE SPOKEN IN A DISPARAGING MANNER OF THE SHOW TABLE AND I HAVE NOT DONE SO LIGHTLY BUT WITH ALL THE CARE AND THOUGHT AND POWER OF OBSERVATION
OF A LEADING DAHLIA NURSERY I FIND THAT THE DECORATIVE KINDS FILL TEN PAGES WHILE THE SHOW KINDS INCLUDING POMPONES FILL ONLY THREE
TWO TRAVELLERS WALKING IN THE NOONDAY SUN SOUGHT THE SHADE OF A WIDESPREADING TREE TO REST AS THEY LAY LOOKING UP AMONG THE PLEASANT LEAVES THEY SAW THAT IT WAS A PLANE TREE
OVER AN INTERNAL SCAFFOLDING OF STICKS WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF TIES AND CROSS BRACES SO THAT IT MAKES A SORT OF SHAPELESS BALL AND TO ARRANGE THE FLOWERS SO THAT THEY ARE EQUALLY SPOTTED ALL OVER IT BY TYING BACK SOME ALMOST TO SNAPPING POINT
AND WHEN PRIVATE GARDENERS GO TO THESE SHOWS AND SEE HOW THE PRIZES ARE AWARDED AND HOW ALL THE GLORY IS ACCORDED TO THE FIRST PRIZE BLOATED MONSTER CAN WE WONDER THAT THE EFFECT ON THEIR MINDS IS CONFUSING
WHAT PROPORTION OF DEMAND THERE IS IN DAHLIAS FOR INSTANCE BETWEEN THE SHOW KINDS WHOSE AIM AND OBJECT IS THE SHOW TABLE AND THE DECORATIVE KINDS THAT ARE INDISPUTABLY BETTER FOR GARDEN USE LOOKING AT THE CATALOGUE
NOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS ALREADY AT HAND FOR GARDEN USE THERE IS NO MERIT WHATEVER IN NOVELTY OR VARIETY UNLESS THE THING NEW OR DIFFERENT IS DISTINCTLY MORE BEAUTIFUL
AND WHY RETRIBUTION HAS COME UPON HIM I HAD MY PLANS ARRANGED BY WHICH I SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING THE MAN WHO HAD WRONGED ME UNDERSTAND THAT HIS OLD SIN HAD FOUND HIM OUT IT CHANCED THAT SOME DAYS BEFORE A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN LOOKING OVER SOME HOUSES IN THE BRIXTON ROAD HAD DROPPED THE KEY OF ONE OF THEM IN MY CARRIAGE
I COULDN'T FORGIVE FLORENCE AND I TOLD HER PLAINLY I COULD NEVER BE A REAL FRIEND TO HER AGAIN FLORENCE FELT BADLY BECAUSE SHE REALLY DID LOVE ME AND SHE ASKED ME TO FORGIVE HER BUT IT SEEMED AS IF I COULDN'T WELL AUNT EMMY THAT WAS MY CHRISTMAS GIFT TO HER MY FORGIVENESS
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LUCY FERRIER NOW I CRIED LOCKING THE DOOR AND SHAKING THE KEY IN HIS FACE PUNISHMENT HAS BEEN SLOW IN COMING BUT IT HAS OVERTAKEN YOU AT LAST
THERE HE REMAINED UNTIL CLOSING TIME AND WHEN HE CAME OUT HE WAS SO FAR GONE THAT I KNEW THE GAME WAS IN MY OWN HANDS
AND THERE IN SOME DESERTED LANE HAVE MY LAST INTERVIEW WITH HIM I HAD ALMOST DECIDED UPON THIS WHEN HE SOLVED THE PROBLEM FOR ME THE CRAZE FOR DRINK HAD SEIZED HIM AGAIN AND HE ORDERED ME TO PULL UP OUTSIDE A GIN PALACE HE WENT IN LEAVING WORD THAT I SHOULD WAIT FOR HIM
I WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT ESCAPE ME AGAIN THEY WERE VERY NEAR DOING IT FOR ALL THAT GO WHERE THEY WOULD ABOUT LONDON I WAS ALWAYS AT THEIR HEELS SOMETIMES I FOLLOWED THEM ON MY CAB AND SOMETIMES ON FOOT
I'M GOING INTO MISTER CALLENDER'S STORE DOWN AT MURRAYBRIDGE IN FEBRUARY
THAT'S BETTER HE SAID WELL I WAITED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR MORE WHEN SUDDENLY THERE CAME A NOISE LIKE PEOPLE STRUGGLING INSIDE THE HOUSE NEXT MOMENT THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND TWO MEN APPEARED ONE OF WHOM WAS DREBBER AND THE OTHER WAS A YOUNG CHAP WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
ON THAT THE SECRETARY GAVE IT UP AS A BAD JOB AND SIMPLY BARGAINED WITH HIM THAT IF HE MISSED THE LAST TRAIN HE SHOULD REJOIN HIM AT HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL
AND I KNEW THAT I COULD GIVE SOME GIFTS AFTER ALL I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY FOR A WEEK AT FIRST I DIDN'T THINK I COULD GIVE SOME OF THEM AND THEN I THOUGHT HOW SELFISH I WAS
WE RATTLED ACROSS WATERLOO BRIDGE AND THROUGH MILES OF STREETS UNTIL TO MY ASTONISHMENT WE FOUND OURSELVES BACK IN THE TERRACE IN WHICH HE HAD BOARDED I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT HIS INTENTION WAS IN RETURNING THERE
THAT IS I FELT THAT ON SECOND THOUGHT AT FIRST AUNT EMMY I THOUGHT I WOULD BE ASHAMED TO OFFER MISS MITCHELL A SHABBY OLD BOOK WORN WITH MUCH READING AND ALL MARKED OVER WITH FATHER'S NOTES AND PENCILLINGS
THINKING THAT I MIGHT HAVE DROPPED IT WHEN I STOOPED OVER DREBBER'S BODY I DROVE BACK AND LEAVING MY CAB IN A SIDE STREET I WENT BOLDLY UP TO THE HOUSE
AND I DID SO WANT TO GIVE SOME LITTLE THING TO EACH OF MY DEAREST PEOPLE BUT I SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT THAT'S THE HATEFUL UGLY TRUTH CLORINDA SIGHED AGAIN THE GIFTS WHICH MONEY CAN PURCHASE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE CAN GIVE SAID AUNT EMMY GENTLY
WAITING TO SEE WHICH WAS TO LIVE AND WHICH WAS TO DIE SHALL I EVER FORGET THE LOOK WHICH CAME OVER HIS FACE WHEN THE FIRST WARNING PANGS TOLD HIM THAT THE POISON WAS IN HIS SYSTEM
HE COWERED AWAY WITH WILD CRIES AND PRAYERS FOR MERCY BUT I DREW MY KNIFE AND HELD IT TO HIS THROAT UNTIL HE HAD OBEYED ME
SHE MUST BE SO LONELY OUT THERE AND AUNT EMMY HERSELF OF COURSE AND POOR OLD AUNT KITTY DOWN THE LANE AND AUNT MARY AND
AND EARLY NEXT MORNING I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME LADDERS WHICH WERE LYING IN THE LANE BEHIND THE HOTEL AND SO MADE MY WAY INTO HIS ROOM IN THE GREY OF THE DAWN I WOKE HIM UP AND TOLD HIM THAT THE HOUR HAD COME WHEN HE WAS TO ANSWER FOR THE LIFE HE HAD TAKEN SO LONG BEFORE
I CAN DRIVE YOU SAID LESTRADE GOOD AND GREGSON CAN COME INSIDE WITH ME YOU TOO DOCTOR YOU HAVE TAKEN AN INTEREST IN THE CASE AND MAY AS WELL STICK TO US I ASSENTED GLADLY AND WE ALL DESCENDED TOGETHER OUR PRISONER MADE NO ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE BUT STEPPED CALMLY INTO THE CAB WHICH HAD BEEN HIS
IF ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE EVER PINED FOR A THING AND LONGED FOR IT DURING TWENTY LONG YEARS AND THEN SUDDENLY FOUND IT WITHIN YOUR REACH YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS I LIT A CIGAR AND PUFFED AT IT TO STEADY MY NERVES BUT MY HANDS WERE TREMBLING AND MY TEMPLES THROBBING WITH EXCITEMENT
THE BLOOD HAD BEEN STREAMING FROM MY NOSE BUT I HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE OF IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT PUT IT INTO MY HEAD TO WRITE UPON THE WALL WITH IT PERHAPS IT WAS SOME MISCHIEVOUS IDEA OF SETTING THE POLICE UPON A WRONG TRACK FOR I FELT LIGHT HEARTED AND CHEERFUL
IF THERE'S A VACANT PLACE FOR A CHIEF OF THE POLICE I RECKON YOU ARE THE MAN FOR IT
ORDINARY LETTER DEAR ME NO I TOOK A WHOLE DAY TO WRITE IT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE POSTMISTRESS'S EYES STICK OUT WHEN I MAILED IT I JUST TOLD HER EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED IN GREENVALE SINCE SHE WENT AWAY I MADE IT AS NEWSY AND CHEERFUL AND LOVING AS I POSSIBLY COULD
I'M WORSE THAN POOR THIS CHRISTMAS I'M STONY BROKE SAID CLORINDA DOLEFULLY MY SPELL OF FEVER IN THE SUMMER AND THE CONSEQUENT DOCTOR'S BILLS HAVE CLEANED OUT MY COFFERS COMPLETELY NOT A SINGLE CHRISTMAS PRESENT CAN I GIVE
THE OFFICIAL WAS A WHITE FACED UNEMOTIONAL MAN WHO WENT THROUGH HIS DUTIES IN A DULL MECHANICAL WAY THE PRISONER WILL BE PUT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES IN THE COURSE OF THE WEEK HE SAID
AND LEAVE MY WORK UNDONE AT LAST ONE EVENING I WAS DRIVING UP AND DOWN TORQUAY TERRACE AS THE STREET WAS CALLED IN WHICH THEY BOARDED WHEN I SAW A CAB DRIVE UP TO THEIR DOOR PRESENTLY SOME LUGGAGE WAS BROUGHT OUT
BUT OF COURSE YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF DEAR IT IS HARD TO BE POOR I KNOW IT I AM POOR
AND THAT IF THE OTHER WOULD WAIT FOR HIM HE WOULD SOON REJOIN HIM HIS COMPANION REMONSTRATED WITH HIM AND REMINDED HIM THAT THEY HAD RESOLVED TO STICK TOGETHER DREBBER ANSWERED THAT THE MATTER WAS A DELICATE ONE AND THAT HE MUST GO ALONE I COULD NOT CATCH WHAT STANGERSON SAID TO THAT
AND EXPRESSED HIS HOPES THAT HE HAD NOT HURT ANY OF US IN THE SCUFFLE
THAT OLD BOOK WHICH FATHER HAD LOVED AND WHICH I LOVED
WHICH HE HAD EXTRACTED FROM SOME SOUTH AMERICAN ARROW POISON AND WHICH WAS SO POWERFUL THAT THE LEAST GRAIN MEANT INSTANT DEATH
IT IS A DREADFUL THING TO BE POOR A FORTNIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS SAID CLORINDA WITH THE MOURNFUL SIGH OF SEVENTEEN YEARS AUNT EMMY SMILED AUNT EMMY WAS SIXTY
SAID CLORINDA WITH A GRIMACE THAT IS MY PREDICAMENT EXACTLY
SAID HE STAMPING ABOUT WE'LL SOON HAVE A LIGHT I SAID STRIKING A MATCH AND PUTTING IT TO A WAX CANDLE WHICH I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME NOW ENOCH DREBBER I CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM AND HOLDING THE LIGHT TO MY OWN FACE WHO AM I
THAT WAS HOW ENOCH DREBBER CAME TO HIS END ALL I HAD TO DO THEN WAS TO DO AS MUCH FOR STANGERSON AND SO PAY OFF JOHN FERRIER'S DEBT I KNEW THAT HE WAS STAYING AT HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL AND I HUNG ABOUT ALL DAY
AND PRINTED IT ON A CONVENIENT PLACE ON THE WALL THEN I WALKED DOWN TO MY CAB AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ABOUT AND THAT THE NIGHT WAS STILL VERY WILD
YOU ARE AT LIBERTY SIR TO GIVE YOUR ACCOUNT WHICH I AGAIN WARN YOU WILL BE TAKEN DOWN I'LL SIT DOWN WITH YOUR LEAVE THE PRISONER SAID SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORD THIS ANEURISM OF MINE MAKES ME EASILY TIRED AND THE TUSSLE WE HAD HALF AN HOUR AGO HAS NOT MENDED MATTERS I'M ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE AND I AM NOT LIKELY TO LIE TO YOU
BUT I INQUIRED AND INQUIRED UNTIL AT LAST I DROPPED ACROSS THEM THEY WERE AT A BOARDING HOUSE AT CAMBERWELL OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WHEN ONCE I FOUND THEM OUT I KNEW THAT I HAD THEM AT MY MERCY I HAD GROWN MY BEARD AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF THEIR RECOGNIZING ME I WOULD DOG THEM AND FOLLOW THEM UNTIL I SAW MY OPPORTUNITY
EVERYTHING BRIGHT AND FUNNY I COULD THINK OF WENT INTO IT THE NEXT WAS OLD AUNT KITTY
OUR PRISONER'S FURIOUS RESISTANCE DID NOT APPARENTLY INDICATE ANY FEROCITY IN HIS DISPOSITION TOWARDS OURSELVES FOR ON FINDING HIMSELF POWERLESS
SHE WAS THINKING OVER WHAT AUNT EMMY HAD SAID ABOUT CHRISTMAS GIFTS AND GIVING
GIVE ME A GLASS OF WATER IF YOU PLEASE MY MOUTH GETS DRY WITH THE TALKING
HE CRIED BUT IT WAS YOU WHO BROKE HER INNOCENT HEART I SHRIEKED THRUSTING THE BOX BEFORE HIM LET THE HIGH GOD JUDGE BETWEEN US CHOOSE AND EAT THERE IS DEATH IN ONE AND LIFE IN THE OTHER I SHALL TAKE WHAT YOU LEAVE LET US SEE IF THERE IS JUSTICE UPON THE EARTH OR IF WE ARE RULED BY CHANCE
IT WAS BUT FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ACTION OF THE ALKALOID IS RAPID A SPASM OF PAIN CONTORTED HIS FEATURES HE THREW HIS HANDS OUT IN FRONT OF HIM STAGGERED AND THEN WITH A HOARSE CRY FELL HEAVILY UPON THE FLOOR I TURNED HIM OVER WITH MY FOOT AND PLACED MY HAND UPON HIS HEART THERE WAS NO MOVEMENT HE WAS DEAD
I WHIPPED UP MY HORSE AND KEPT WITHIN SIGHT OF THEM FEELING VERY ILL AT EASE FOR I FEARED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SHIFT THEIR QUARTERS AT EUSTON STATION THEY GOT OUT AND I LEFT A BOY TO HOLD MY HORSE AND FOLLOWED THEM ON TO THE PLATFORM
HE REMARKED TO SHERLOCK HOLMES MY CAB'S AT THE DOOR IF YOU'LL LOOSE MY LEGS I'LL WALK DOWN TO IT I'M NOT SO LIGHT TO LIFT AS I USED TO BE
AS I DROVE I COULD SEE OLD JOHN FERRIER AND SWEET LUCY LOOKING AT ME OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND SMILING AT ME JUST AS PLAIN AS I SEE YOU ALL IN THIS ROOM ALL THE WAY THEY WERE AHEAD OF ME
AS IF THEY THOUGHT THIS PROPOSITION RATHER A BOLD ONE BUT HOLMES AT ONCE TOOK THE PRISONER AT HIS WORD
WON'T YOUR AUNT MISS YOU TERRIBLY SAID AUNT EMMY GRAVELY CLORINDA FLUSHED THERE WAS A NOTE IN AUNT EMMY'S VOICE THAT DISTURBED HER OH YES I SUPPOSE SHE WILL
SHE IS VERY DEAF AND RATHER DULL AND STUPID YOU KNOW WELL I GAVE HER A WHOLE DAY I TOOK MY KNITTING YESTERDAY AND SAT WITH HER THE WHOLE TIME AND JUST TALKED AND TALKED I TOLD HER ALL THE GREENVALE NEWS AND GOSSIP AND EVERYTHING ELSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKE TO HEAR
AND WANTED TO BE REAL CLOSE FRIENDS AGAIN I GAVE AUNT MARY HER GIFT THIS MORNING
CLORINDA PUZZLED OVER AUNT EMMY'S MEANING FOR FOUR DAYS AND PART OF THREE NIGHTS THEN ALL AT ONCE IT CAME TO HER OR IF IT WASN'T AUNT EMMY'S MEANING IT WAS A VERY GOOD MEANING IN ITSELF AND IT GREW CLEARER AND EXPANDED IN MEANING DURING THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED
ON A SOFA OR IN A WHEEL CHAIR BUT AUNT EMMY WAS NEVER HEARD TO SIGH I SUPPOSE IT IS WORSE THEN THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME SHE ADMITTED THAT WAS ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT AUNT EMMY SHE ALWAYS SYMPATHIZED AND UNDERSTOOD
BUT STILL IT WAS ONE I LOVED VERY MUCH
I DO WISH I COULD FIND OUT IF IT WOULD HELP ME ANY I'D LOVE TO REMEMBER A FEW OF MY FRIENDS AT LEAST THERE'S MISS MITCHELL SHE'S BEEN SO GOOD TO ME ALL THIS YEAR
THEN FLORENCE ONCE TOLD ROSE WATSON SOMETHING I HAD TOLD HER IN CONFIDENCE
IN THE SILENCE OF THE ROOM I COULD HEAR A DULL HUMMING AND BUZZING NOISE WHICH PROCEEDED FROM THE SAME SOURCE WHY I CRIED YOU HAVE AN AORTIC ANEURISM THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT HE SAID PLACIDLY I WENT TO A DOCTOR LAST WEEK ABOUT IT
I'M DREADFULLY TIRED OF BEING POOR AUNT EMMY AND NOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO EARN SOMETHING FOR MYSELF I MEAN TO TAKE IT I CAN HELP AUNT MARY TOO I'M TO GET FOUR DOLLARS A WEEK I THINK SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE YOUR COMPANIONSHIP THAN A PART OF YOUR SALARY CLORINDA SAID AUNT EMMY
I'VE GOT A GOOD DEAL TO SAY OUR PRISONER SAID SLOWLY I WANT TO TELL YOU GENTLEMEN ALL ABOUT IT HADN'T YOU BETTER RESERVE THAT FOR YOUR TRIAL
WOULD YOU MURDER ME HE STAMMERED THERE IS NO MURDER I ANSWERED WHO TALKS OF MURDERING A MAD DOG WHAT MERCY HAD YOU UPON MY POOR DARLING WHEN YOU DRAGGED HER FROM HER SLAUGHTERED FATHER AND BORE HER AWAY TO YOUR ACCURSED AND SHAMELESS HAREM
THE HARDEST JOB WAS TO LEARN MY WAY ABOUT FOR I RECKON THAT OF ALL THE MAZES THAT EVER WERE CONTRIVED THIS CITY IS THE MOST CONFUSING I HAD A MAP BESIDE ME THOUGH AND WHEN ONCE I HAD SPOTTED THE PRINCIPAL HOTELS AND STATIONS I GOT ON PRETTY WELL IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE I FOUND OUT WHERE MY TWO GENTLEMEN WERE LIVING
THERE WAS NOT A SOUL TO BE SEEN NOR A SOUND TO BE HEARD EXCEPT THE DRIPPING OF THE RAIN WHEN I LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOW I FOUND DREBBER ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP I SHOOK HIM BY THE ARM IT'S TIME TO GET OUT I SAID ALL RIGHT CABBY
AND WE FOLLOWED HIM LESTRADE MOUNTED THE BOX WHIPPED UP THE HORSE AND BROUGHT US IN A VERY SHORT TIME TO OUR DESTINATION WE WERE USHERED INTO A SMALL CHAMBER WHERE A POLICE INSPECTOR NOTED DOWN OUR PRISONER'S NAME AND THE NAMES OF THE MEN WITH WHOSE MURDER HE HAD BEEN CHARGED
SOME OF THEM QUITE COSTLY TOO THAT IS THEY WILL COST ME SOMETHING BUT I KNOW I'LL BE BETTER OFF AND RICHER AFTER I'VE PAID THE PRICE THAT IS WHAT MISTER GRIERSON WOULD CALL A PARADOX ISN'T IT
I HAD TO WALK BESIDE HIM TO KEEP HIM STEADY FOR HE WAS STILL A LITTLE TOP HEAVY WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR I OPENED IT AND LED HIM INTO THE FRONT ROOM I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT ALL THE WAY THE FATHER AND THE DAUGHTER WERE WALKING IN FRONT OF US IT'S INFERNALLY DARK
BUT DREBBER WAS RATHER PLEASED THAN OTHERWISE I GOT SO CLOSE TO THEM IN THE BUSTLE THAT I COULD HEAR EVERY WORD THAT PASSED BETWEEN THEM
OR TO DESIRE THEY WERE RICH AND I WAS POOR SO THAT IT WAS NO EASY MATTER FOR ME TO FOLLOW THEM WHEN I GOT TO LONDON MY POCKET WAS ABOUT EMPTY AND I FOUND THAT I MUST TURN MY HAND TO SOMETHING FOR MY LIVING DRIVING AND RIDING ARE AS NATURAL TO ME AS WALKING
SAID CLORINDA KISSING HER WHY YOU ARE THE RICHEST WOMAN I KNOW AUNT EMMY RICH IN LOVE AND GOODNESS AND CONTENTMENT
SHE WAS SO PLEASED AND PROUD SHE TOLD ME WHEN I CAME AWAY THAT SHE HADN'T HAD SUCH A NICE TIME FOR YEARS THEN THERE WAS
HE STAGGERED BACK WITH A LIVID FACE AND I SAW THE PERSPIRATION BREAK OUT UPON HIS BROW WHILE HIS TEETH CHATTERED IN HIS HEAD AT THE SIGHT I LEANED MY BACK AGAINST THE DOOR AND LAUGHED LOUD AND LONG I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT VENGEANCE WOULD BE SWEET BUT I HAD NEVER HOPED FOR THE CONTENTMENT OF SOUL WHICH NOW POSSESSED ME
THAT GIRL THAT I SPOKE OF WAS TO HAVE MARRIED ME TWENTY YEARS AGO SHE WAS FORCED INTO MARRYING THAT SAME DREBBER AND BROKE HER HEART OVER IT I TOOK THE MARRIAGE RING FROM HER DEAD FINGER AND I VOWED THAT HIS DYING EYES SHOULD REST UPON THAT VERY RING AND THAT HIS LAST THOUGHTS SHOULD BE OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH HE WAS PUNISHED
YOU DOG I SAID I HAVE HUNTED YOU FROM SALT LAKE CITY TO SAINT PETERSBURG AND YOU HAVE ALWAYS ESCAPED ME NOW AT LAST YOUR WANDERINGS HAVE COME TO AN END FOR EITHER YOU OR I SHALL NEVER SEE TO MORROW'S SUN RISE
DRIVE ME TO HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL SAID HE WHEN I HAD HIM FAIRLY INSIDE MY CAB MY HEART JUMPED SO WITH JOY THAT I FEARED LEST AT THIS LAST MOMENT MY ANEURISM MIGHT GO WRONG I DROVE ALONG SLOWLY WEIGHING IN MY OWN MIND WHAT IT WAS BEST TO DO I MIGHT TAKE HIM RIGHT OUT INTO THE COUNTRY
AREN'T THEY ALL WORTH WHILE OF COURSE THEY ARE LAUGHED CLORINDA ONLY UNFORTUNATELY CHRISTMAS GIFTS CAN'T BE COINED OUT OF THEM DID YOU EVER TRY ASKED AUNT EMMY
YOU MAY CONSIDER ME TO BE A MURDERER BUT I HOLD THAT I AM JUST AS MUCH AN OFFICER OF JUSTICE AS YOU ARE
WE ALWAYS HAVE SUCH FADED BROWN DECEMBERS CLORINDA LIVED JUST ACROSS THE ROAD FROM AUNT EMMY IN A TINY WHITE HOUSE BEHIND SOME HUGE WILLOWS BUT AUNT MARY LIVED THERE TOO THE ONLY RELATIVE CLORINDA HAD FOR AUNT EMMY WASN'T REALLY HER AUNT AT ALL CLORINDA HAD ALWAYS LIVED WITH AUNT MARY EVER SINCE SHE COULD REMEMBER
HE WAS CUNNING WAS STANGERSON AND ALWAYS ON HIS GUARD IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD KEEP ME OFF BY STAYING INDOORS HE WAS VERY MUCH MISTAKEN
HE SHRUNK STILL FURTHER AWAY AS I SPOKE AND I COULD SEE ON HIS FACE THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS MAD SO I WAS FOR THE TIME
I HAD MY ENEMIES WITHIN MY POWER TOGETHER THEY COULD PROTECT EACH OTHER BUT SINGLY THEY WERE AT MY MERCY I DID NOT ACT HOWEVER WITH UNDUE PRECIPITATION MY PLANS WERE ALREADY FORMED
I'LL TEACH YOU TO INSULT AN HONEST GIRL
THEN YOU KNOW MISSUS MARTIN LAST YEAR SHE WAS MISS HOPE MY DEAR SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER SHE MARRIED A HOME MISSIONARY AND THEY ARE IN A LONELY PART OF THE WEST WELL I WROTE HER A LETTER NOT JUST AN
I'LL EXPLAIN ALL ABOUT IT TO YOU ON CHRISTMAS DAY ON CHRISTMAS DAY CLORINDA WENT OVER TO AUNT EMMY'S IT WAS A FADED BROWN CHRISTMAS AFTER ALL FOR THE SNOW HAD NOT COME BUT CLORINDA DID NOT MIND THERE WAS SUCH JOY IN HER HEART THAT SHE THOUGHT IT THE MOST DELIGHTFUL CHRISTMAS DAY THAT EVER DAWNED
BUT WELL YOU KNOW AUNT EMMY I'M ASHAMED TO CONFESS IT
THAT KIND OF GIFT IS JUST AS MUCH OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR ME AS ANY OTHER THAT WAS NOT WHAT I MEANT SAID AUNT EMMY WHAT DID YOU MEAN THEN ASKED CLORINDA LOOKING PUZZLED AUNT EMMY SMILED SUPPOSE YOU THINK OUT MY MEANING FOR YOURSELF SHE SAID
THEY WERE VERY CUNNING THOUGH THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS SOME CHANCE OF THEIR BEING FOLLOWED FOR THEY WOULD NEVER GO OUT ALONE AND NEVER AFTER NIGHTFALL DURING TWO WEEKS I DROVE BEHIND THEM EVERY DAY AND NEVER ONCE SAW THEM SEPARATE DREBBER HIMSELF WAS DRUNK HALF THE TIME BUT STANGERSON WAS NOT TO BE CAUGHT NAPPING
AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT THEY WERE FREE ONCE MORE I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I EYED HIM THAT I HAD SELDOM SEEN A MORE POWERFULLY BUILT MAN AND HIS DARK SUNBURNED FACE BORE AN EXPRESSION OF DETERMINATION AND ENERGY WHICH WAS AS FORMIDABLE AS HIS PERSONAL STRENGTH
ALTHOUGH AT FIRST CLORINDA SHRANK A LITTLE FROM SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH IT LED HER
AND THERE'S MISSUS MARTIN OUT IN MANITOBA
AUNT EMMY PATTED THE HAND THAT WAS IN HER OWN FROM YOUR FACE DEAR GIRL IT WILL BE PLEASANT HEARING AND TELLING SHE SAID CLORINDA NODDED AUNT EMMY I THOUGHT FOR DAYS OVER YOUR MEANING
FROM THAT DAY I HAD ALWAYS MY PILL BOXES ABOUT WITH ME AND THE TIME HAD NOW COME WHEN I WAS TO USE THEM IT WAS NEARER ONE THAN TWELVE AND A WILD BLEAK NIGHT BLOWING HARD AND RAINING IN TORRENTS
IF I DIE TO MORROW AS IS LIKELY ENOUGH I DIE KNOWING THAT MY WORK IN THIS WORLD IS DONE AND WELL DONE
CLORINDA STOPPED SHORT SUDDENLY SHE HAD JUST REMEMBERED THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE LIKED TO SAY THAT LAST SENTENCE TO AUNT EMMY THEREFORE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT IT CLORINDA HAD LONG AGO LEARNED THAT THERE WAS SURE TO BE SOMETHING WRONG IN ANYTHING THAT COULD NOT BE SAID TO AUNT EMMY SO SHE STOPPED TO THINK IT OVER
EVERY WORD I SAY IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND HOW YOU USE IT IS A MATTER OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ME WITH THESE WORDS JEFFERSON HOPE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND BEGAN THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE STATEMENT HE SPOKE IN A CALM AND METHODICAL MANNER AS THOUGH THE EVENTS WHICH HE NARRATED WERE COMMONPLACE ENOUGH
TO SOLVE HE WALKED DOWN THE ROAD AND WENT INTO ONE OR TWO LIQUOR SHOPS STAYING FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR IN THE LAST OF THEM WHEN HE CAME OUT HE STAGGERED IN HIS WALK AND WAS EVIDENTLY PRETTY WELL ON
THAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN IF I EXPLAINED IT BESIDES I DON'T THINK I COULD EXPLAIN IT TAKE THE BEAUTIFUL LINE OF A BEAUTIFUL POEM TO HELP YOU IN YOUR THINKING OUT THE GIFT WITHOUT THE GIVER IS BARE
BUT I WASN'T WILLING TO PAY WHAT I HAD I GOT OVER THAT THOUGH AUNT EMMY NOW I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I DID GIVE FIRST THERE WAS MY TEACHER MISS MITCHELL I GAVE HER ONE OF FATHER'S BOOKS
NOR THE BEST EITHER OH I KNOW IT'S NICER TO GIVE SOMETHING OF YOUR OWN WORK AGREED CLORINDA
BY MEANS OF THIS I HAD ACCESS TO AT LEAST ONE SPOT IN THIS GREAT CITY
I WAS A FAIRLY GOOD DISPENSER SO I WORKED THIS ALKALOID INTO SMALL SOLUBLE PILLS AND EACH PILL I PUT IN A BOX WITH A SIMILAR PILL MADE WITHOUT THE POISON I DETERMINED AT THE TIME THAT WHEN I HAD MY CHANCE MY GENTLEMEN SHOULD EACH HAVE A DRAW OUT OF ONE OF THESE BOXES WHILE I ATE THE PILL THAT REMAINED IT WOULD BE QUITE AS DEADLY
I FEEL CHEERED UP YOU ALWAYS CHEER PEOPLE UP AUNT EMMY HOW GREY IT IS OUTDOORS
YES I AM I ANSWERED THEN PUT YOUR HAND HERE HE SAID WITH A SMILE MOTIONING WITH HIS MANACLED WRISTS TOWARDS HIS CHEST I DID SO AND BECAME AT ONCE CONSCIOUS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY THROBBING AND COMMOTION WHICH WAS GOING ON INSIDE
OH PUSSY SAID THE QUEEN ONE DAY YOU ARE HAPPIER THAN I AM FOR YOU HAVE A DEAR KITTEN JUST LIKE YOURSELF AND I HAVE NOBODY TO PLAY WITH BUT YOU DON'T CRY ANSWERED THE CAT
MADE SCURRILOUS CHARGES AGAINST HIM WHICH WERE ANSWERED BY THAT GREAT WRITER ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
GROUND A DEAD COAL MIXED IT WITH BEAR'S OIL AND RUBBED IT ON HIS ENTIRE FACE DURING THIS TIME EVERY HOLE IN THE TENT WAS OCCUPIED WITH AN EYE AMONG THE LOOKERS ON WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER SHE WAS VERY NEAR RELENTING
AND IT FELL INTO A CLUMP OF ROSE BUSHES THE PRINCESS OF COURSE RAN AFTER IT AT ONCE
IT CAN BE IMAGINED THAT A GASP OF ASTONISHMENT AND ADMIRATION WENT THROUGH THE ASSEMBLAGE THAT HEARD THIS COURAGEOUS OFFER FOR THE MAN WHO VOLUNTEERED FOR SUCH SERVICE WAS GOING TO LIVING DEATH TO A PLACE OF HORROR AND HUMAN SUFFERING
BUT HAD BEEN CARRIED THERE BY MERCHANTS OR VOYAGERS FROM THE FAR EAST WHERE WAS ITS HOME BUT IT SPREAD SO RAPIDLY AMONG THE NATIVES THAT BEFORE LONG IT SEEMED AS IF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS THEMSELVES HAD BEEN THE CRADLE OF THIS TERRIBLE SCOURGE THIS WAS DUE WE ARE TOLD
IT WAS NOW FULL BORN DAY THE SUN SHONE HOT UPON THE BARE GROUND AND THE DROPS STOOD UPON SNANA'S FOREHEAD AS SHE PLIED HER LONG POLE THERE WAS A COOL SPRING IN THE DRY CREEK BED NEAR BY
THE OTHER WAS OHITIKA THE WOMAN HAD BEEN INVITED TO STAY ALTHOUGH ONLY A NEIGHBOR THE DOG BY FORCE OF HABIT HAD TAKEN UP HIS USUAL POSITION BY THE SIDE OF HIS MASTER WHEN THEY ENTERED THE TEEPEE
WHEN HE CAUGHT HIS GRANDMOTHER'S EYE AND RECOLLECTED HER OFT REPEATED ADAGE TEARS FOR WOMAN AND THE WAR WHOOP FOR MAN TO DROWN SORROW HE SWALLOWED TWO OR THREE BIG MOUTHFULS OF HEARTACHE
AND THE MOTHER WAS NOT TOO FAR AWAY TO HEAR NOW SHE CALLED FRANTICALLY FOR HER CHILD AT THE SAME TIME STAMPING WITH HER DELICATE FOREFEET YES SISTER YOU ARE RIGHT SHE IS YOURS BUT YOU CANNOT SAVE HER TO DAY
TO THE HOSPITABLE HABITS OF THE ISLANDERS WHO LIVED CLOSELY TOGETHER
HE HASTENED TO THE TENT FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED CARRYING IN HIS HANDS A BOW AND ARROWS GORGEOUSLY PAINTED WHILE THE SMALL BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS THAT HE HAD KILLED WITH THESE WEAPONS DANGLED FROM HIS BELT
SO THAT ONLY RED WAS REQUIRED AND THIS HAKADAH SUPPLIED GENEROUSLY
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT BY AND BY SAID THE CAT AS SHE MADE HER BEST BOW AND TURNED HER HORSE'S HEAD THE PRINCESS WAS VERY UNHAPPY WHEN KISA LEFT HER WITHOUT EVEN BIDDING HER FAREWELL SHE WOULD NEITHER EAT NOR DRINK
TOSH SHE REPLIED COQUETTISHLY IT WAS SO OFTEN SAID AMONG THE INDIANS THAT THE DOE WAS WONT TO PUT ON HUMAN FORM TO MISLEAD THE HUNTER THAT IT LOOKED STRANGE TO SEE A WOMAN WITH A FAWN AND THE YOUNG MAN COULD NOT FORBEAR TO GAZE UPON SNANA YOU ARE NOT THE REAL MOTHER IN MAIDEN'S GUISE TELL ME TRULY IF YOU ARE OF HUMAN BLOOD
IN A FEW MINUTES SHE HEARD THE LIGHT PATTER OF HOOFS AND CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A DOE RUNNING STRAIGHT TOWARD THE FAWN'S HIDING PLACE WHEN SHE STOLE NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE DOE AND THE FAWN WERE EXAMINING ONE ANOTHER CAREFULLY AS IF FEARING SOME TREACHERY AT LAST BOTH WERE APPARENTLY SATISFIED
EVEN WHEN MY OWN WAS IN DANGER HO HO WAKAN YE LO YES YES TIS HOLY OR MYSTERIOUS THEY EXCLAIMED APPROVINGLY
FATHER DAMIEN'S REAL NAME WAS JOSEPH DE VEUSTER
AND WAS DESTINED IN THE END TO MAKE HIS NAME FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE CIVILIZED WORLD THE PICPUS FATHERS LIKE MANY OTHER CATHOLIC BROTHERS WERE GREAT MISSIONARIES CARRYING ON THIS SERVICE IN WHAT WERE THEN CALLED THE SANDWICH ISLANDS
AS HE COULD NOT SLEEP IN THE HUTS OF THE LEPERS THE BRAVE PRIEST MADE HIS LODGING ON THE GROUND BENEATH A PANDANUS TREE AND CALLING HIS NEW PARISHIONERS TOGETHER HE PREACHED TO THEM WITH BRAVE AND COMFORTING WORDS TELLING THEM THAT THEY MUST NOT DESPAIR
BUT THINK MY BOY YOU HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED THE THING THAT WILL BE A PLEASANT OFFERING TO THE GREAT MYSTERY THE BOY LOOKED INTO THE WOMAN'S FACE WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION
YOU MUST REMEMBER SHE SAID THAT IN THIS OFFERING YOU WILL CALL UPON HIM WHO LOOKS AT YOU FROM EVERY CREATION IN THE WIND YOU HEAR HIM WHISPER TO YOU HE GIVES HIS WAR WHOOP IN THE THUNDER HE WATCHES YOU BY DAY WITH HIS EYE THE SUN
AND BEGAN TO BE SORRY THAT SHE HAD NOT STAYED WITHIN REACH OF HELP BUT AS THERE WAS NO USE IN DISOBEYING THE GIANT SHE WALKED MEEKLY BEHIND
AND AFTER THAT WHEN SPEAKING TO HIS CONGREGATION HE USED THE WORDS WE LEPERS TELLING THEM THAT HE HIMSELF HAD RECEIVED THE CROSS FROM WHICH THEY SUFFERED AND HENCEFORTH WAS ONE OF THEM IN SOMETHING MORE THAN NAME
A FEELING OF AWE AND REVERENCE CAME TO THE BOY IT IS THE HOME OF THE GREAT MYSTERY HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AND THE IMPRESSIVENESS OF HIS SURROUNDINGS MADE HIM FORGET HIS SORROW VERY SOON WAHCHEWIN CAME WITH SOME DIFFICULTY TO THE STEPS
IN ANSWER TO THE SUMMONS THERE EMERGED FROM THE WOODS WHICH WERE ONLY A FEW STEPS AWAY A BOY ACCOMPANIED BY A SPLENDID BLACK DOG THERE WAS LITTLE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE LITTLE FELLOW TO DISTINGUISH HIM FROM THE OTHER SIOUX BOYS
THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO THE MOUTH OF AN IMMENSE CAVE SOME FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE RIVER UNDER THE CLIFF
DESERTED BY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES LIVING IN WRETCHEDNESS AND DESOLATION
WHILE THE FILLED PIPE WAS LAID BESIDE THE DEAD OHITIKA SHE SCATTERED PAINTS AND TOBACCO ALL ABOUT AGAIN THEY STOOD A FEW MOMENTS SILENTLY THEN SHE DREW A DEEP BREATH AND BEGAN HER PRAYER TO THE GREAT MYSTERY
THE SHARP POINTED STICK WITH WHICH THE SIOUX WOMEN DIG WILD TURNIPS THEY WERE GAYLY GOSSIPING TOGETHER OR EACH HUMMING A LOVE SONG AS SHE WORKED ONLY SNANA STOOD SOMEWHAT APART FROM THE REST IN FACT CONCEALED BY THE CREST OF THE RIDGE
HOW LONG IT WAS SINCE SHE HAD SET OUT IN THE MORNING SHE COULD NOT TELL IT SEEMED YEARS TO HER OF COURSE BUT THE SUN WAS STILL HIGH IN THE HEAVENS WHEN SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF WHEELS AND THEN WITH A GREAT EFFORT FOR HER THROAT WAS PARCHED WITH FRIGHT AND PAIN SHE GAVE A SHOUT
NOW BETTER KNOWN AS THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
WHO HAD A SERIOUS AND CONTEMPLATIVE NATURE EVEN WHEN VERY YOUNG AND SPENT MUCH OF HIS TIME IN PRAYER AND MEDITATION ON ONE OCCASION WHEN ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD JOSEPH HAD BEEN FOUND
SUBMITTED OHITIKA TO WACOOTA WITH A SMILE AND WALKED OFF WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER AND WAHCHEWIN THE BOY AND HIS GRANDMOTHER DESCENDED THE BANK FOLLOWING A TORTUOUS FOOT PATH UNTIL THEY REACHED THE WATER'S EDGE
O GREAT MYSTERY WE HEAR THY VOICE IN THE RUSHING WATERS BELOW US WE HEAR THY WHISPER IN THE GREAT OAKS ABOVE OUR SPIRITS ARE REFRESHED WITH THY BREATH FROM WITHIN THIS CAVE O HEAR OUR PRAYER BEHOLD THIS LITTLE BOY AND BLESS HIM
ARE THESE THE THINGS DEAREST TO YOU SHE DEMANDED NOT THE BOW AND ARROWS BUT THE PAINTS WILL BE VERY HARD TO GET FOR THERE ARE NO WHITE PEOPLE NEAR AND THE NECKLACE IT IS NOT EASY TO GET ONE LIKE IT AGAIN
THEY LEARNED IT EVENTUALLY FROM OTHERS AND THE SHOCK OF THE DISCOVERY HASTENED HIS MOTHER'S DEATH AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS SERVICE AMONG THE LEPERS FATHER DAMIEN DIED OF THE DISEASE LEAVING BEHIND HIM A NAME FOR PURE SELF SACRIFICE THAT HAS NOT BEEN SURPASSED
IT WAS NO SMALL TROUBLE FOR SNANA TO KEEP HER TRUST AS MAY WELL BE SUPPOSED ALL THE DOGS OF THE TEEPEE VILLAGE MUST BE WATCHED AND KEPT AT A DISTANCE NEITHER WAS IT EASY TO FEED THE LITTLE CAPTIVE
NOW WOMANLY SYMPATHY FOR THE MOTHER WAS IN CONTROL AND NOW A DESIRE TO POSSESS AND PROTECT HER HELPLESS PET I CAN TAKE CARE OF HER AGAINST ALL HUNTERS BOTH ANIMAL AND HUMAN
THE MOTHER SYMPATHY HAD TAKEN HOLD ON HER MIND SHE PICKED THE FAWN UP TENDERLY BOUND ITS LEGS AND PUT IT ON HER BACK TO CARRY LIKE AN INDIAN BABE IN THE FOLDS OF HER ROBE
THE HUNTERS WILL SOON BE HERE LET ME KEEP HER FOR YOU I WILL RETURN HER TO YOU SAFELY AND HEAR ME O SISTER OF THE WOODS THAT SOME DAY I MAY BECOME THE MOTHER OF A NOBLE RACE OF WARRIORS AND OF FINE WOMEN AS HANDSOME AS YOU ARE
AND FLEW FOR THE NEAREST SCRUB OAK ON THE EDGE OF THE BANK UP THE TREE SHE SCRAMBLED WITH THE FAWN STILL SECURELY BOUND TO HER BACK THE GRIZZLY CAME ON WITH TEETH EXPOSED AND THE DOE MOTHER IN HER FLIGHT CAME BETWEEN HIM AND THE TREE
THE DOE CARESSED HER NATURAL CHILD AND THE LITTLE ONE ACCEPTED THE MILK SHE OFFERED IN THE SIOUX MAIDEN'S MIND THERE WAS TURMOIL A CLOSE ATTACHMENT TO THE LITTLE WILD CREATURE HAD ALREADY TAKEN ROOT THERE CONTENDING WITH THE SENSE OF JUSTICE THAT WAS STRONG WITHIN HER
IT WILL BE A GREAT FEAT IF I CAN FIND AND TAKE FROM HER THE BABE THE LITTLE TAWNY SKIN SHALL BE BEAUTIFULLY DRESSED BY MY MOTHER
AND AT LENGTH BEGAN TO CRY
IN HER TWO FRONT PAWS LAID HER UPON SOME SOFT HAY AND DROVE BACK TO HER OWN LITTLE HUT IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS A PILE OF CUSHIONS AND THESE KISA ARRANGED AS A BED
BUT MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR LIVES AS THEY WERE AND THAT HE WOULD HELP THEM TO BUILD BETTER HOUSES AND BRING TO THEM THE COMFORTS THAT THEY NEEDED AND AT ONCE HE BUSIED HIMSELF GETTING BUILDING MATERIALS FROM THE GOVERNMENT WITH WHICH TRIM COTTAGES WERE BUILT
BUT HE WAS UNMINDFUL OF HIS FRIEND AND COMPANION OHITIKA THE DOG SO SCARCELY HAD UNCHEEDAH FINISHED SPEAKING WHEN HE ALMOST SHOUTED GRANDMOTHER I WILL GIVE UP ANY OF MY POSSESSIONS FOR THE OFFERING TO THE GREAT MYSTERY
GIVING A SERIES OF INDIGNANT SNORTS AS SHE RAN
IN THAT FAR COUNTRY THAN BY REMAINING IN LOUVAIN WHERE HE HAD HIS PARISH AFTER HIS PASSAGE HAD BEEN ENGAGED HOWEVER
AS IT WAS HAKADAH CAME OUT OF THE TEEPEE WITH HIS FACE LOOKING LIKE AN ECLIPSED MOON LEADING HIS BEAUTIFUL DOG WHO WAS EVEN HANDSOMER THAN EVER WITH THE RED TOUCHES ON HIS SPECKS OF WHITE IT WAS NOW UNCHEEDAH'S TURN TO STRUGGLE WITH THE STORM AND BURDEN IN HER SOUL
THEY ARE EVER READY TO SEIZE THE HELPLESS FAWN FOR FOOD HER LIFE WILL BE OFTEN EXPOSED YOU CANNOT SAVE HER FROM DISASTER O TAKCHA MY SISTER LET ME STILL KEEP HER FOR YOU SHE FINALLY APPEALED TO THE POOR DOE
MY OHITIKA IS UPON HIM HE KNELT UPON ONE KNEE AS HE TALKED HIS BLACK EYES SHINING LIKE EVENING STARS SIT DOWN HERE SAID UNCHEEDAH TO THE BOY I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU
JOSEPH HIMSELF PLANNED TO TAKE THE NAME OF FATHER DAMIEN FOR SOME TIME JOSEPH LIVED WITH HIS BROTHER IN LOUVAIN WHERE HE CONTINUED HIS STUDIES BUT HE WAS NOT YET ORDAINED AS A PRIEST WHEN AN EVENT TOOK PLACE THAT CHANGED THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE
AS USUAL HER ATTENDANTS LET HER DO ANYTHING SHE PLEASED AND SITTING DOWN ON A MOSSY BANK WHERE A LITTLE STREAM TINKLED BY SOON FELL SOUND ASLEEP
BUT THE BOY WAS EMBOLDENED BY THE PEOPLE'S ADMIRATION OF HIS BRAVERY AND DID NOT SHED A TEAR AS SOON AS SHE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK THE LOVING GRANDMOTHER SAID NO MY YOUNG BRAVE NOT SO YOU MUST NOT MOURN FOR YOUR FIRST OFFERING WASH YOUR FACE
TO PUT HER IN THE BABY'S COT SHE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND WHAT A HUNT THERE WAS FOR THAT KITTEN TO BE SURE THE SERVANTS EACH ANXIOUS TO FIND HER AS THE QUEEN WAS CERTAIN TO REWARD THE LUCKY MAN SEARCHED IN THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE PLACES
A LITTLE STREAM OF LIMPID WATER TRICKLED DOWN FROM A SPRING WITHIN THE CAVE THE LITTLE WATERCOURSE SERVED AS A SORT OF NATURAL STAIRCASE FOR THE VISITORS A COOL PLEASANT ATMOSPHERE EXHALED FROM THE MOUTH OF THE CAVERN
WHICH WAS BEING ADDRESSED BY THE BISHOP WHO SAID THAT HE DEEPLY REGRETTED THAT HE COULD SPARE NO PRIEST TO SEND TO THE ISLAND OF MOLOKAI TO THE UNFORTUNATE LEPERS WHO SEEMED TO BE CAST OFF THERE FORSAKEN OF GOD AND MAN ALIKE
AND THEY IMMEDIATELY GAVE A GENERAL ALARM MATO SAW THEM BUT APPEARED NOT AT ALL CONCERNED AND WAS STILL INTENT UPON DISLODGING THE GIRL WHO CLUNG FRANTICALLY TO HER PERCH PRESENTLY THERE APPEARED UPON THE LITTLE KNOLL SEVERAL WARRIORS MOUNTED AND UTTERING THE USUAL WAR WHOOP
ANSWERED INGIBJORG VERY MUCH PUZZLED FOR SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE SO LONG AGO DON'T YOU REMEMBER HOW I ALWAYS SLEPT IN YOUR COT BESIDE YOU AND HOW YOU CRIED TILL I CAME BUT GIRLS HAVE NO MEMORIES AT ALL
UNLESS THE KITTEN LAY CURLED UP BESIDE HER TWO OR THREE MONTHS WENT BY AND THOUGH THE BABY WAS STILL A BABY THE KITTEN WAS FAST BECOMING A CAT AND ONE EVENING WHEN AS USUAL THE NURSE CAME TO LOOK FOR HER
AT NIGHT HE GAZES UPON YOUR SLEEPING COUNTENANCE THROUGH THE MOON IN SHORT IT IS THE MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES WHO CONTROLS ALL THINGS TO WHOM YOU WILL MAKE YOUR FIRST OFFERING BY THIS ACT YOU WILL ASK HIM TO GRANT TO YOU WHAT HE HAS GRANTED TO FEW MEN
ALLOWING EXPERIMENTS TO BE PERFORMED ON THEIR OWN BODIES AND GIVING THEIR LIVES WITHOUT FEAR IN THE HOPE OF SAVING INVALIDS AND SUFFERERS BUT NO STORY IS MORE THRILLING THAN THAT OF THE BELGIAN PRIEST NAMED FATHER DAMIEN
TO DAY YOU WILL MAKE YOUR FIRST OFFERING TO HIM THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE FAIRLY DILATED THE EYES OF THE YOUNG HUNTER FOR HE FELT THAT A GREAT EVENT WAS ABOUT TO OCCUR IN WHICH HE WOULD BE THE PRINCIPAL ACTOR BUT UNCHEEDAH RESUMED HER SPEECH
HE DEMANDED RUDELY I AM A SIOUX MAIDEN DO YOU NOT KNOW MY FATHER SHE REPLIED AH BUT WHO IS YOUR FATHER WHAT IS HIS NAME HE INSISTED NERVOUSLY FINGERING HIS ARROWS
ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE ALTAR OF THE CHURCH WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM HOME AND BEEN LOST IN THE WOODS OR THE FIELDS ABOUT THE TOWN
NOR TAKE ANY NOTICE OF ALL THE BEAUTIFUL DRESSES HER PARENTS BOUGHT FOR HER SHE WILL DIE UNLESS WE CAN MAKE HER LAUGH ONE WHISPERED TO THE OTHER IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE WORLD THAT WE HAVE LEFT UNTRIED
NOT FAR FROM THE CITY OF LOUVAIN THAT BECAME FAMOUS IN THE WORLD WAR WHEN THE GERMANS SACKED IT BURNED ITS UNIVERSITY AND MURDERED ITS INHABITANTS A STRONG RELIGIOUS IMPULSE RULED THE DE VEUSTER FAMILY AND OUT OF THREE CHILDREN
AND THOSE THAT LIVED THERE TRIED TO FORGET THEIR UNHAPPY LOT IN WILD ORGIES AND REVELS DRINKING A FIERY SPIRIT THEY DISTILLED THEMSELVES CALLED KI WHICH WAS MADE FROM THE ROOT OF A PLANT THAT GREW IN PROFUSION ON THE ISLAND FIGHTING AND GAMBLING AS THEY CHOSE AND DYING LIKE DOGS
YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE NOW ALMOST A MAN OBSERVE THE GAME YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE YOU WILL LEAVE ME
THIS WAS MERE SPECULATION HOWEVER FOR THE CLEAR SIGHTED OLD WOMAN HAD DETERMINED TO KEEP THIS PART OF THE MATTER SECRET UNTIL THE OFFERING SHOULD BE COMPLETED
AT THIS MOMENT THE QUICK EYES OF THE INDIAN GIRL DETECTED SOMETHING STRANGE IN THE DOE'S ACTIONS SHE GLANCED IN EVERY DIRECTION AND BEHOLD
AND TO STUDY THE FRENCH LANGUAGE BUT WHILE HE HAD GONE THERE WILLINGLY HE FELT THE DESIRE FOR A RELIGIOUS LIFE MORE AND MORE STRONGLY
WITHOUT MOVING A MUSCLE SAVE THOSE OF HIS EYES HE HAD BEEN A VERY CLOSE OBSERVER OF WHAT PASSED HAD THE DOG BUT MOVED ONCE TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF HIS LITTLE FRIEND HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DISSUADED FROM THAT IMPETUOUS EXCLAMATION
WHILE THE BARE SPOTS WERE PURPLE WITH THE WILD DAKOTA CROCUSES
THIS BLUNT HEADED ARROW SAID HE ACTUALLY HAD EYES THIS MORNING
WELL HIDDEN BY A CLUMP OF CHOKE CHERRY BUSHES AND SHE TURNED THITHER TO COOL HER THIRSTY THROAT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE RAVINE HER EYE CAUGHT A FAMILIAR FOOTPRINT THE TRACK OF A DOE WITH THE YOUNG FAWN BESIDE IT THE HUNTING INSTINCT AROSE WITHIN
WHO WAS NERVOUSLY WATCHING THE INTRUDER AND APPARENTLY THINKING HOW SHE MIGHT BEST ESCAPE WITH THE FAWN JUST AT THIS MOMENT THERE CAME A LOW CALL FROM THE WOOD IT WAS A DOE CALL BUT THE WILD MOTHER AND HER NEW FRIEND BOTH KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT THE CALL OF A REAL DOE
WHY I COULD FIND MY WAY STRAIGHT UP TO THAT COT THIS MOMENT IF I WAS ONCE INSIDE THE PALACE WHY DID YOU GO AWAY THEN ASKED THE PRINCESS
HAKADAH COOWAH WAS THE SONOROUS CALL
DURING THIS SPEECH THE BOY HAD BEEN COMPLETELY AROUSED TO THE SPIRIT OF MANLINESS AND IN HIS EXCITEMENT WAS WILLING TO GIVE UP ANYTHING HE HAD EVEN HIS PONY
IF THE BLACKFEET OR THE CROWS DO NOT STEAL HIM UNCHEEDAH WAS NOT FULLY SATISFIED WITH THE BOY'S FREE OFFERINGS PERHAPS IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM WHAT SHE REALLY WANTED BUT UNCHEEDAH KNEW WHERE HIS AFFECTION WAS VESTED HIS FAITHFUL DOG
THROUGH HIS EFFORTS A HOSPITAL WAS FINALLY PROVIDED AND A DOCTOR CAME TO MOLOKAI AND FOLLOWING HIS EXAMPLE SISTERS OF MERCY AND BRAVE MISSIONARIES CAME THERE TO WORK BUT FOR A LONG TIME
THE PRINCESS SAW WITH DELIGHT THAT THEY WOULD PAY NO HEED TO HER AND WANDERED ON AND ON EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO SEE SOME FAIRIES DANCING ROUND A RING OR SOME LITTLE BROWN ELVES PEEPING AT HER FROM BEHIND A TREE BUT ALAS SHE MET NONE OF THESE
WITHIN THE TENT SAT TWO OLD WOMEN ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE FIRE UNCHEEDAH WAS THE BOY'S GRANDMOTHER WHO HAD BROUGHT UP THE MOTHERLESS CHILD
AND WATER PIPES THROUGH WHICH HE HAD FRESH WATER PIPED DOWN TO THE SETTLEMENT FROM A COLD SPRING ABOVE THE CLIFF HE BUILT A CHAPEL AND A DISPENSARY AND NOT CONTENT WITH THIS HE BANDAGED THE SORES OF THE LEPERS WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND WASHED THEIR WOUNDS
JOSEPH HIMSELF IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS PARENTS DESIGN THAT HE WAS TO BECOME A BUSINESS MAN WENT TO A TOWN IN FRANCE CALLED BRAINE LE COMTE TO LEARN THE RUDIMENTS OF A COMMERCIAL CAREER
HE IS BRAVE AND YOU TOO ARE BRAVE HE WILL NOT FEAR DEATH YOU WILL BEAR HIS LOSS BRAVELY COME HERE ARE FOUR BUNDLES OF PAINTS AND A FILLED PIPE LET US GO TO THE PLACE
UPON THE LOWEST OF A SERIES OF NATURAL TERRACES THERE STOOD ON THIS MAY MORNING A YOUNG SIOUX GIRL WHOSE GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS WERE NOT UNLIKE THOSE OF A DOE WHICH CHANCED TO BE LURKING IN A NEIGHBORING GULCH ON THE UPPER PLAINS NOT FAR AWAY WERE HER YOUNG COMPANIONS ALL BUSILY EMPLOYED WITH THE WEWOPTAY AS IT IS CALLED
ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOW AN INVALID HE DID NOT FAIL TO PERFORM HIS PRIESTLY DUTIES UNTIL THE END BUT HE NEVER TOLD HIS FAMILY IN BELGIUM OF THE MISFORTUNE
GRANDMOTHER I WILL GIVE UP ANY OF MY POSSESSIONS IT WAS HARD FOR UNCHEEDAH TO TELL THE BOY THAT HE MUST PART WITH HIS DOG BUT SHE WAS EQUAL TO THE SITUATION HAKADAH SHE PROCEEDED CAUTIOUSLY YOU ARE A YOUNG BRAVE
WHICH HE PICKED UP AND PUT IN HIS POCKET
DO NOT BE A COWARD SURELY YOU SHOULD KNOW A MAID OF YOUR OWN RACE SHE REPLIED REPROACHFULLY AH YOU KNOW THE TRICKS OF THE DOE WHAT IS THY NAME HAST THOU FORGOTTEN THE ETIQUETTE OF THY PEOPLE
THE MEN RAN FORWARD AND COUNTED THEIR COUPS ON HIM JUST AS WHEN AN ENEMY IS FALLEN THEN THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND PLACED THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR MOUTHS AS THE YOUNG GIRL DESCENDED THE TREE WITH A FAWN BOUND UPON HER BACK
IT IS A SIOUX HUNTER WHISPERED THE GIRL YOU MUST GO MY SISTER BE OFF I WILL TAKE YOUR CHILD TO SAFETY WHILE SHE WAS YET SPEAKING THE DOE SEEMED TO REALIZE THE DANGER SHE STOPPED ONLY AN INSTANT TO LICK FONDLY THE TAWNY COAT OF THE LITTLE ONE
TWO WERE DESTINED FOR A RELIGIOUS LIFE AS A MATTER OF FACT ALL THREE FINALLY ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH A GIRL NAMED PAULINE WHO ENTERED A CONVENT AND TWO BROTHERS AUGUSTE AND JOSEPH WHO BECAME RESPECTIVELY
HAD SHE NOT FEARED THE WRATH OF THE GREAT MYSTERY SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO CALL OUT TO THE BOY KEEP YOUR DEAR DOG MY CHILD
WHERE HIS BROTHER WAS ALREADY A PRIEST IN HOLY ORDERS
UNTIL HE FINALLY TOLD HIS PARENTS THAT HE DESIRED TO BE A PRIEST IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO OBTAIN THEIR CONSENT AND JOSEPH WENT TO PARIS TO STUDY AT THE SAME SCHOOL THAT HIS BROTHER HAD ATTENDED IN PARIS JOSEPH SERVED AS A NOVICE AND WHEN THIS TERM WAS ENDED HE WENT TO LOUVAIN
AND WHOSE CONDITION WAS WRETCHED BEYOND BELIEF BUT FATHER DAMIEN AT ONCE AROSE AND POINTED OUT TO THE BISHOP THAT A PRIEST COULD BE SPARED FOR SUCH SERVICE
AND HE MADE THE OFFER IN SIMPLE SINCERITY WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF HIMSELF OR OF THE DANGERS THAT HE WOULD ENCOUNTER
WAHCHEWIN WAS ONLY A CALLER BUT SHE HAD BEEN INVITED TO REMAIN AND ASSIST IN THE FIRST PERSONAL OFFERING OF HAKADAH TO THE GREAT MYSTERY IT HAD BEEN WHISPERED THROUGH THE TEEPEE VILLAGE THAT UNCHEEDAH INTENDED TO GIVE A FEAST IN HONOR OF HER GRANDCHILD'S FIRST SACRIFICIAL OFFERING
AND THE NATIVES HAVE BECOME KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR THEIR STRANGE CUSTOMS THEIR UNUSUAL MUSIC AND THEIR SKILL IN SWIMMING THE DEEP BLUE WATERS THAT SURROUND THE LAND WHERE THEY LIVE
LAYING HER PAW ON HER MISTRESS'S ARM CRYING NEVER DOES ANY GOOD I WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE THE CAT WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD AS SOON AS SHE RETURNED FROM HER DRIVE SHE TROTTED OFF TO THE FOREST TO CONSULT A FAIRY WHO DWELT THERE
IF IT WOULD BE HIS PLEASURE FOR HIM TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND ENGAGE IN THE MISSIONARY WORK THAT HAD BEEN INTENDED FOR THE ELDER BROTHER
AND WAS AT ONCE MADE A FULL PRIEST AND GIVEN A PARISH IN A WILD PART OF THE COUNTRY A PARISH SO LARGE THAT IT TOOK HIM DAYS TO GO FROM ONE END OF IT TO THE OTHER
I KNOW YOU WISH TO BE A GREAT WARRIOR AND HUNTER I AM NOT PREPARED TO SEE MY HAKADAH SHOW ANY COWARDICE FOR THE LOVE OF POSSESSIONS IS A WOMAN'S TRAIT AND NOT A BRAVE'S
TO THIS HE FASTENED TWO OF THE SQUIRRELS TAILS AND A WING FROM THE ORIOLE THEY HAD KILLED THAT MORNING JUST THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT GOOD WARRIORS ALWAYS MOURN FOR THEIR DEPARTED FRIENDS AND THE USUAL MOURNING WAS BLACK PAINT HE LOOSENED HIS BLACK BRAIDED LOCKS
THE PRINCESS WAS VERY MUCH VEXED WITH HER LADIES IN WAITING FOR FRIGHTENING AWAY HER OLD PLAYFELLOW AND TOLD THE QUEEN WHO CAME TO HER ROOM EVERY EVENING TO BID HER GOOD NIGHT YES IT IS QUITE TRUE WHAT KISA SAID ANSWERED THE QUEEN
THIS SOMEWHAT CONFUSED THE BOY NOT THAT HE WAS SELFISH BUT RATHER UNCERTAIN AS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE THING TO GIVE THEN TOO HE SUPPOSED THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER REFERRED TO HIS ORNAMENTS AND PLAYTHINGS ONLY SO HE VOLUNTEERED
ORIGINALLY THE PARENTS OF THESE THREE CHILDREN HAD DECIDED THAT AUGUSTE WAS TO BECOME A PRIEST AND JOSEPH WAS TO ENTER BUSINESS AND BE A MERCHANT BUT IT COULD EASILY BE SEEN THE PRIESTHOOD WAS ALSO THE LIFE FOR JOSEPH
AND WOULDST COMPEL ME TO PRONOUNCE MY OWN NAME I REFUSE THOU ART JESTING SHE RETORTED WITH A SMILE
AND OF HERDING SHEEP UNTIL HE BECAME KNOWN AS THE LITTLE SHEPHERD WHEN JOSEPH WAS EIGHTEEN HIS SISTER PAULINE LEFT HOME TO ENTER THE CONVENT AND EVEN BEFORE THAT TIME HIS BROTHER HAD GONE TO PARIS TO STUDY AT THE HOME OF THE PICPUS FATHERS
AH A MOTHER'S RUSE SNANA ENTERED THE THORNY ENCLOSURE WHICH WAS ALMOST A RUDE TEEPEE AND TUCKED AWAY IN THE FURTHER MOST CORNER LAY SOMETHING WITH A TROUT LIKE SPECKLED TAWNY COAT SHE BENT OVER IT THE FAWN WAS APPARENTLY SLEEPING
AND VERY SOON AFTER THE QUEEN HAD A LITTLE GIRL WHO SEEMED MADE OUT OF SNOW AND SUNBEAMS THE QUEEN WAS DELIGHTED AND SOON THE BABY BEGAN TO TAKE NOTICE OF THE KITTEN AS SHE JUMPED ABOUT THE ROOM
AND THE LITTLE WARRIOR WAS MASTER OF THE SITUATION GRANDMOTHER MY BRAVE WILL HAVE TO DIE LET ME TIE TOGETHER TWO OF THE PRETTIEST TAILS OF THE SQUIRRELS THAT HE AND I KILLED THIS MORNING TO SHOW TO THE GREAT MYSTERY WHAT A HUNTER HE HAS BEEN
FOR A WARRIOR MUST SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE HIM GREAT AMONG HIS PEOPLE YOU MUST ENDEAVOR TO EQUAL YOUR FATHER AND GRANDFATHER SHE WENT ON THEY WERE WARRIORS AND FEAST MAKERS
SO THAT WAS THE BAIT THEY CRIED AND WILL YOU NOT MAKE A FEAST WITH THAT FAWN FOR US WHO CAME TO YOUR RESCUE THE FAWN IS YOUNG AND TENDER AND WE HAVE NOT EATEN MEAT FOR TWO DAYS IT WILL BE A GENEROUS THING TO DO ADDED HER FATHER WHO WAS AMONG THEM YE E E SHE CRIED OUT IN DISTRESS DO NOT ASK IT I HAVE SEEN THIS FAWN'S MOTHER I HAVE PROMISED TO KEEP HER CHILD SAFE SEE I HAVE SAVED ITS LIFE
THAT THE MOTHER WOULD RETURN SHE CROUCHED UNDER A CLUMP OF BUSHES NEAR BY AND GAVE THE DOE CALL IT WAS A RECKLESS THING FOR HER TO DO FOR SUCH A CALL MIGHT BRING UPON HER A MOUNTAIN LION OR EVER WATCHFUL SILVER TIP BUT SNANA DID NOT THINK OF THAT
FOR ONE OF THE NEWCOMERS TO THE ISLANDS COULD TAKE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PARISH WHILE HE HIMSELF HE SAID WOULD GO TO MOLOKAI AND SPEND HIS LIFE IN CARING FOR THE LEPERS WHOSE CONDITION MADE HIS HEART BLEED WHENEVER HE THOUGHT OF THEM
I AM COMING WAS THE ANSWER AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT A CART MADE ITS WAY THROUGH THE TREES DRIVEN BY KISA WHO USED HER TAIL AS A WHIP TO URGE THE HORSE TO GO FASTER
AS IF THEY WERE ABOUT TO SWOOP DOWN UPON A HUMAN ENEMY THIS TOUCHED THE DIGNITY OF MATO AND HE IMMEDIATELY PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE EVERY INDIAN WAS ALIVE TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE OCCASION FOR IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MATO OR GRIZZLY BEAR ALONE AMONG ANIMALS
AND HE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT OTHERS WOULD CARRY ON EFFICIENTLY THE WORK THAT HE HAD BEGUN BUT IN SPITE OF ALL HIS BRAVERY AND HIS SELF SACRIFICE THIS HEROIC PRIEST WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS TRADUCERS A SHORT TIME AFTER HIS DEATH A CERTAIN MISSIONARY NAMED DOCTOR HYDE
WHEN THE LAST WORDS WERE UTTERED HAKADAH DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR THEM HE WAS SIMPLY UNABLE TO SPEAK TO A CIVILIZED EYE HE WOULD HAVE APPEARED AT THAT MOMENT LIKE A LITTLE COPPER STATUE HIS BRIGHT BLACK EYES WERE FAST MELTING IN FLOODS OF TEARS
BUT FATHER DAMIEN THOUGHT LITTLE OF ALL THIS
LEPROSY WAS NOT A NATIVE DISEASE IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS ORIGINALLY
EVERY INDIAN BOY KNOWS THAT WHEN A WARRIOR IS ABOUT TO MEET DEATH HE MUST SING A DEATH DIRGE HAKADAH THOUGHT OF HIS OHITIKA AS A PERSON WHO WOULD MEET HIS DEATH WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
AND WERE SO HORRIFIED AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGE CAT
WHO WAS WAGGING HIS TAIL PROMISCUOUSLY AS IF TO SAY MASTER AND I ARE REALLY HUNTERS HAKADAH BREATHLESSLY GAVE A DESCRIPTIVE NARRATIVE OF THE KILLING OF EACH BIRD AND SQUIRREL AS HE PULLED THEM OFF HIS BELT AND THREW THEM BEFORE HIS GRANDMOTHER
BELIEVING THAT THE GREAT MYSTERY SHOULD BE MET IN SILENCE AND DIGNITY THE BOY CAME RUSHING INTO THE LODGE FOLLOWED BY HIS DOG OHITIKA
AND SOON A LETTER WAS RECEIVED CONSENTING TO THE NEW ARRANGEMENT WILD WITH DELIGHT HE TOLD HIS BROTHER OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND AT ONCE COMMENCED MAKING HIS PREPARATIONS FOR THE VOYAGE THE ISLANDS TO WHICH FATHER DAMIEN WAS BOUND ARE OF THE GREATEST TROPICAL BEAUTY
IS GIVEN THE RANK OF A WARRIOR SO THAT WHOEVER CONQUERS HIM MAY WEAR AN EAGLE FEATHER WOO WOO THE WARRIORS SHOUTED AS THEY MANEUVERED TO DRAW HIM INTO THE OPEN PLAIN
HE WORKED HARD AND SOON BECAME WELL KNOWN AMONG THE NATIVES UNDER HIS CARE AND TO HIS FELLOW CHURCHMEN AS A MAN OF GREAT EARNESTNESS AND MUCH PHYSICAL STRENGTH ONE DAY FATHER DAMIEN HAPPENED TO BE AT A MEETING OF CHURCHMEN
AND WHEN THE CAT DROVE THE CART UP TO THE PALACE GATE LASHING THE HORSE FURIOUSLY WITH HER TAIL AND THE KING AND QUEEN SAW THEIR LOST DAUGHTER
BUT IT IS NOT THE POOR HUNTER WHO MAKES MANY FEASTS DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THE LEGEND OF THE FEAST MAKER WHO GAVE FORTY FEASTS IN TWELVE MOONS AND HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE STORY OF THE WARRIOR WHO SOUGHT THE WILL OF THE GREAT MYSTERY
HE ANSWERED WITH HOARSE GROWLS THREATENING A RIDER WHO HAD VENTURED TOO NEAR BUT ARROWS WERE MANY AND WELL AIMED AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE GREAT AND WARLIKE MATO LAY DEAD AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE
THEN SHE BOUNDED AWAY AS SNANA EMERGED FROM THE BUSHES WITH HER CHARGE A YOUNG HUNTER MET HER FACE TO FACE AND STARED AT HER CURIOUSLY HE WAS NOT OF HER FATHER'S CAMP BUT A STRANGER UGH YOU HAVE MY GAME
NOTHING EXCEPT MARRIAGE ANSWERED THE KING AND HE INVITED ALL THE HANDSOMEST YOUNG MEN HE COULD THINK OF TO THE PALACE
SHE PLACED THE BODY OF OHITIKA UPON THE GROUND IN A LIFE LIKE POSITION AND AGAIN LEFT THE TWO ALONE
LET ME PAINT HIM MYSELF THIS REQUEST UNCHEEDAH COULD NOT REFUSE AND SHE LEFT THE PAIR ALONE FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE SHE WENT TO ASK WACOOTA TO EXECUTE OHITIKA
AFTER A VOYAGE OF FIVE MONTHS IN WHICH HIS SHIP CONTENDED WITH MANY GALES AND MUCH ROUGH WEATHER FATHER DAMIEN ARRIVED IN THE SANDWICH ISLANDS
AT THAT TIME HOWEVER THEY WERE SUFFERING FROM THE RAVAGES OF THE MOST TERRIBLE DISEASE PERHAPS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD CERTAINLY THE ONE MOST FEARED FROM THE TIMES OF THE BIBLE DOWN TO THE PRESENT DAY THIS WAS THE DISEASE OF LEPROSY
PRESENTLY ITS EYES MOVED A BIT AND A SHIVER PASSED THROUGH ITS SUBTLE BODY THOU SHALT NOT DIE THY SKIN SHALL NOT BECOME MY WORK BAG UNCONSCIOUSLY THE MAIDEN SPOKE
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA HE HAD LIVED TO SEE THE LEPER COLONY GROW FROM A RIBALD OBSCENE SETTLEMENT TO AN ORDERLY HOSPITAL WHERE AS MUCH AS WAS POSSIBLE WAS DONE FOR THE SUFFERERS THAT WERE COMPELLED TO REMAIN THERE
BOXES WERE OPENED THAT WOULD HARDLY HAVE HELD THE KITTEN'S PAW BOOKS WERE TAKEN FROM BOOKSHELVES LEST THE KITTEN SHOULD HAVE GOT BEHIND THEM DRAWERS WERE PULLED OUT FOR PERHAPS THE KITTEN MIGHT HAVE GOT SHUT IN
FATHER DAMIEN WAS ALONE WITH HIS CHARGES PERFORMING ROUGH TASKS WITH NONE TO AID HIM EXCEPT THE AID THAT HE OBTAINED FROM THE LEPERS THEMSELVES IT CANNOT BE THOUGHT THAT A MAN WHO PERFORMED SUCH SERVICES COULD FOREVER ESCAPE CONTRACTING THE DISEASE
AND AFTER FATHER DAMIEN HAD BEEN TEN YEARS ON MOLOKAI HE FOUND HIMSELF A VICTIM OF THE SCOURGE AGAINST WHICH HE HAD SO BRAVELY AND SUCCESSFULLY CONTENDED A VISIT TO THE RESIDENT DOCTOR CONFIRMED THE WORST OF HIS FEARS
ON THE IMPULSE OF THIS THOUGHT SHE SUMMONED A LOYAL AND TRUSTED VASSAL TO HER AID VON LEYENBURG SHE SAID GO YOU IN HASTE AND IN SECRET TO THE LORD OF ARKELL AND BEAR FROM ME THIS MESSAGE FOR HIS EAR ALONE THUS SAYS THE LADY OF HOLLAND
IN CLINGING ROBES OF BLUE AND UNDERGOWN OF CLOTH OF GOLD THE PRINCESS JACQUELINE HERSELF THE WATCHERS IN THE GALLERY FOLLOWED THE LION'S STARE AND SAW WITH HORROR THE ADVANCING FIGURE OF THIS FAIR YOUNG GIRL
THEN UPROSE THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL HOLD THERE HE CRIED HOTLY THIS HUBERT OF MALSEN IS BUT A CRAVEN SIRS IF HE DOTH SAY THE MERCHANTS OF DORT ARE RASCAL COWARDS HAD THEY BEEN FAIRLY MATED HE HAD NO MORE DARED TO PUT HIS NOSE WITHIN THE GATES OF DORT
FRIEND OTTO IS A BRAVE YOUNG GALLANT ELSE HAD HE NEVER DARED RAISED SPEAR AND BANNER AS HE DID AGAINST HIS RIGHTFUL LIEGE BUT MY FATHER PERSISTED THE GENTLE HEARTED GIRL SPEAR AND BANNER ARE NOT LIONS JAWS AND SURELY YOU MAY NOT IN HONOR PERMIT THE WILFUL MURDER OF A HOSTAGE
FOR THIS LITTLE MAID OF THIRTEEN HAD BEEN FOR EIGHT YEARS THE WIFE OF THE DAUPHIN OF FRANCE THE YOUNG PRINCE JOHN OF TOURAINE TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN MARRIED WHEN SHE WAS SCARCE FIVE YEARS OLD AND HE BARELY NINE SURROUNDED BY ALL THE POMP OF AN AGE OF GLITTER AND DISPLAY
MARGARET THE EMPRESS AND PHILIPPA THE QUEEN AND OF A HOUSE THAT TRACED ITS DESCENT THROUGH THE WARLIKE HOHENSTAUFENS BACK TO CHARLEMAGNE HIMSELF ALL GIRLS ADMIRE BRAVERY EVEN THOUGH NOT THEMSELVES PERSONALLY COURAGEOUS
AND SHE WAS PLEDGED BY HER DYING FATHER'S COMMAND TO MARRY HER COUSIN WHOM SHE DETESTED DUKE JOHN OF BRABANT BUT HOW MUCH BETTER SO SHE REASONED THAT THE NAME AND MIGHT OF HER HOUSE AS RULERS OF HOLLAND SHOULD BE UPHELD BY A BRAVE AND FEARLESS KNIGHT
BUT AJAX FIERCEST OF THE THREE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE LAD STRAIGHT ACROSS HIS COMRADES HE LOOKED TO WHERE SCARCE A ROD BEHIND THE DARING LAD CAME ANOTHER FIGURE A LIGHT AND GRACEFUL FORM
AND OCCUPIED AMONG OTHER PLACES THE IMPORTANT TOWN OF GORKUM ON THE MAAS THE STOUT CITADEL OF THE TOWN WAS HOWEVER GARRISONED WITH LOYAL TROOPS THIS THE LORD OF ARKELL BESEIGED AND DEMANDING ITS SURRENDER
EVEN THE CHIVALRY OF THAT DAY WHICH SHOULD HAVE PROMPTED HIM TO AID RATHER THAN ANNOY THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE RAISED A CONSIDERABLE ARMY AMONG THE KNIGHTS OF THE CODS OR LIBERAL PARTY AND THE WARLIKE MERCHANTS OF THE CITIES TOOK POSSESSION OF MANY STRONG POSITIONS IN HOLLAND
NO LONGER CROWN PRINCESS AND HEIRESS TO A THRONE BUT SIMPLY LADY OF HOLLAND BUT IN HOLLAND TOO SORROW WAS IN STORE FOR HER SWIFTLY FOLLOWING THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND THE DAUPHIN
HAD HERSELF LOWERED THE DRAWBRIDGE ADMITTED HER ARMED RETAINERS OVERPOWERED AND DRIVEN OUT HER REBELLIOUS SON AND THAT THEN RELENTING SHE HAD APPEALED TO COUNT WILLIAM TO PARDON THE LAD AND TO RECEIVE HIM AT COURT AS HOSTAGE FOR HIS OWN FEALTY
THE BRAVE VON BREDERODE FELL PIERCED WITH WOUNDS AND THE DAY SEEMED LOST INDEED TO THE LADY OF HOLLAND THEN JACQUELINE THE COUNTESS SEEING HER CAUSE IN DANGER LIKE ANOTHER JOAN OF ARC THOUGH SHE WAS INDEED A YOUNGER AND MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL GIRL GENERAL
BUT BEFORE HE COULD ACT
SHE WAS DAUGHTER OF HOLLAND COUNTESS OF PONTHIEU DUCHESS OF BERRY LADY OF CREVECOEUR OF MONTAGUE AND ARLOEUX BROUGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF TILTS AND TOURNAMENTS OF BANQUETS AND FEASTING AND ALL THE LAVISH DISPLAY OF THE RICH BAVARIAN COURT
WERE IT NOT BETTER OTTO OF ARKELL THAT WE JOIN HANDS IN MARRIAGE BEFORE THE ALTAR THAN THAT WE SPILL THE BLOOD OF FAITHFUL FOLLOWERS AND VASSALS IN A CRUEL FIGHT IT WAS A SINGULAR AND PERHAPS TO OUR MODERN EARS A MOST UNLADYLIKE PROPOSAL
WAS REARED IN THE SCHOOL OF SO CALLED CHIVALRY AND ROMANCE WHICH IN HER TIME WAS FAST APPROACHING ITS END SHE WAS INDEED AS ONE HISTORIAN DECLARES THE LAST HEROINE OF KNIGHTHOOD
SHE RAISED HER FACE TO THE STARTLED GALLERIES YOU WHO COULD DARE AND YET DARED NOT TO DO SHE CRIED IT SHALL NOT BE SAID THAT IN ALL COUNT WILLIAM'S COURT NONE SAVE THE REBEL LORD OF ARKELL DARED TO FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS
THE LORD OF ARKELL DREW THE LOOSE GRAY CLOAK OVER HIS RICH SILK SUIT AND TURNED TOWARD THE DOOR OTTO VON ARKELL LETS NO ONE CALL HIM FOOL OR COWARD LORD PRINCE HE SAID WHAT I HAVE DARED YOU ALL TO DO I DARE DO IF YOU DO NOT
AND WE CANNOT BUT THINK WITH SADNESS UPON THE POWER FOR GOOD THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN HER LAND OF FOGS AND FLOODS IF INSTEAD OF BEING MADE THE TOOL OF PARTY HATE AND THE AMBITIONS OF MEN HER FRANK AND FEARLESS GIRL NATURE
TO JOIN IN THE FESTIVITIES AT COUNT WILLIAM'S COURT NOT ONE THAT APPROACHED HER FATHER IN NOBILITY OF BEARING OR MANLY STRENGTH NOT EVEN HER HUSBAND HER HUSBAND YES
GO YOU INTO THE LIONS DEN LORD PRINCE AND I WILL FOLLOW YOU THOUGH IT WERE INTO OLD HERCULES VERY TEETH IT WAS A SHREWD REPLY AND COVERED AS GOOD A DOUBLE DARE AS EVER ONE BOY MADE TO ANOTHER SOME OF THE MANLIER OF THE YOUNG COURTIERS INDEED EVEN DARED TO APPLAUD
AND SO BETWEEN ALL THESE YOUNG FOLK THERE WAS MUCH BOASTFUL TALK AND MUCH HARMLESS GOSSIP HOW THE LITTLE LADY OF COURTRAI HAD USED THE WRONG CORNER OF THE TOWEL YESTERDAY
IT IS NOT THEREFORE SURPRISING THAT THIS INTREPID AND ROMANCE REARED YOUNG PRINCESS THE WIFE OF A LAD FOR WHOM SHE NEVER ESPECIALLY CARED AND WHOSE SOCIETY HAD FOR POLITICAL REASONS BEEN FORCED UPON HER SHOULD HAVE PLACED AS THE HERO OF HER ADMIRATION
WHEN THEY WERE NOT AS AT THE TIME OF OUR STORY
HERALD OF ARKELL AS HIS TRUMPET BLAST SOUNDED BEFORE THE GATE OF THE CITADEL THE FREE LORD OF ARKELL HERE GIVETH YOU WORD AND WARNING THAT HE WILL FIGHT AGAINST YOU ON THE MORROW AND FROM THE CITADEL CAME BACK THIS RINGING REPLY AS THE KNIGHT OF LEYENBURG MADE ANSWER FOR HIS SOVEREIGN LADY
BUT THE KNIGHTS AND NOBLES WHO FOLLOWED HER BANNER LOUDLY PRAISED HER VALOR AND HER FEARLESSNESS AND THEIR HIGHEST AND MOST KNIGHTLY VOW THEREAFTER WAS TO SWEAR BY THE COURAGE OF OUR PRINCESS THE BRILLIANT VICTORY OF THIS GIRL OF SIXTEEN WAS NOT HOWEVER
THE STORY OF JACQUELINE OF HOLLAND IS ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC THAT HAS COME DOWN TO US FROM THOSE ROMANTIC DAYS OF THE KNIGHTS HAPPY ONLY IN HER EARLIEST AND LATEST YEARS SHE IS NEVERTHELESS A BRIGHT AND ATTRACTIVE FIGURE AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF FEUDAL TYRANNY AND CRIME
BUT IT SHOWS HOW EVEN IN THE HEART OF A SOVEREIGN COUNTESS AND A GIRL GENERAL WARLIKE DESIRES MAY GIVE PLACE TO GENTLER THOUGHTS TO THE LORD ARKELL HOWEVER THIS UNEXPECTED PROPOSITION CAME AS AN INDICATION OF WEAKNESS
THE LORD OF ARKELL SPRANG TO HIS COMRADE'S SIDE WITH A HURRIED WORD OF PRAISE HE FLUNG THE GABARDINE ABOUT HER GRASPED HER ARM AND BADE HER KEEP HER EYES FIRMLY FIXED UPON THE LIONS THEN STEP BY STEP THOSE TWO FOOLHARDY YOUNG PERSONS BACKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE DANGER
APPEARED THE BRAVE LAD WHO HAD ONCE BEEN THE COMPANION OF THE PRINCESS IN DANGER THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL IT WAS HE WHO LIFTED THE STANDARD OF REVOLT AGAINST HER REGENCY PLACING THE WELFARE OF HOLLAND ABOVE PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP AND SINKING IN HIS DESIRE FOR GLORY
COUNT WILLIAM OF HOLLAND DEARLY LOVED PLUCK AND NERVE WELL DAUGHTER MINE HE SAID
MAY BE ACQUIRED BY EVERY GIRL AND BOY WHO READS THIS ROMANTIC STORY OF THE COUNTESS JACQUELINE
FOR AS THE RECORDS TELL US THEY DID NO HARM TO THEIR VISITORS AJAX SLOWLY ROSE AND LOOKED UP INTO THE GIRL'S CALM FACE THEN THE VOICE OF JACQUELINE RANG OUT FRESH AND CLEAR AS STANDING WITH HER HAND BURIED IN THE LION'S TAWNY MANE
HEAR YE SIR HERALD AND ANSWER THUS TO THE REBEL LORD OF ARKELL FOR THE PURPOSE OF FIGHTING HIM CAME WE HERE AND FIGHT HIM WE WILL UNTIL HE AND HIS REBELS ARE BEATEN AND DEAD LONG LIVE OUR SOVEREIGN LADY OF HOLLAND ON THE MORROW
NAY MADAM HAVE NO FEAR THE LORD OF ARKELL SAID BENDING IN COURTEOUS RECOGNITION OF HER INTEREST THAT WHICH I DO OF MINE OWN FREE WILL IS NO MURDER EVEN SHOULD IT FAIL AND HE HASTENED FROM THE HALL
FROM HER STATION IN THE CITADEL SHE LOOKED OVER THE SCENE BEFORE HER HERE ALONG THE LOW BANK OF THE RIVER MAAS STRETCHED THE CAMP OF HER OWN FOLLOWERS AND THE LITTLE GAYLY COLORED BOATS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER ARMY UP THE RIVER FROM THE RED ROOFS OF ROTTERDAM
AND LAID HIS HAND CARESSINGLY UPON THE SHAGGY MANE CLOSE TO HIS SIDE PRESSED JUNO THE LIONESS AND SO SAYS THE RECORD OF THE OLD DUTCH CHRONICLER VON HILDEGAERSBERCH THE LIONS DID HIM NO HARM
INTO WHICH THEY HAD SO THOUGHTLESSLY AND UNNECESSARILY FORCED THEMSELVES THE LIONS GATE CLOSED BEHIND THEM WITH A CLANG
SEIZED THE LION BANNER OF HER HOUSE AND AT THE HEAD OF HER RESERVE TROOPS CHARGED THROUGH THE OPEN GATE STRAIGHT INTO THE RANKS OF HER VICTORIOUS FOES THERE WAS NEITHER MERCY NOR GENTLENESS IN HER HEART THEN AS WHEN SHE HAD COWED WITH A LOOK AJAX THE LION
SENT ALSO A HAUGHTY CHALLENGE TO THE YOUNG COUNTESS WHO WAS HASTENING TO THE RELIEF OF HER BELEAGUERED TOWN JACQUELINE'S ANSWER WAS SWIFT AND UNMISTAKABLE WITH THREE HUNDRED SHIPS AND SIX THOUSAND KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS
BUT NOW THE LORD OF ARKELL HAD FOUND HIS TONGUE MY LORD PRINCE HE SAID BOWING LOW WITH STATELY COURTESY IF AS MY LADY MOTHER AND GOOD COUNT WILLIAM WOULD FORCE ME I AM TO BE LOYAL VASSAL TO YOU MY LIEGES HERE I SHOULD BUT FOLLOW WHERE YOU DARE TO LEAD
SUCCEEDED TO HIS TITLES AND LORDSHIP AS COUNTESS AND LADY SUPREME OF HAINAULT OF HOLLAND AND OF ZEALAND FOR YEARS HOWEVER THERE HAD BEEN THROUGHOUT THE LOW COUNTRIES A STRONG OBJECTION TO THE RULE OF A WOMAN
EASILY SLIP FROM IT OTTO VON ARKELL BOLDLY ENTERED THE INCLOSURE SOHO JUNO UP HERCULES HOLLO UP AJAX CRIED COUNT WILLIAM FROM THE BALCONY HERE COMETH A RIGHT ROYAL PLAYFELLOW UP UP MY BEAUTIES AND THE GREAT BRUTES ROUSED BY THE VOICE OF THEIR MASTER
SHE WAS AS WE LEARN FROM HER CHRONICLERS THE LEADER OF ADORING KNIGHTS AND VASSALS THE IDOL OF HER PARENTS THE RULER OF HER SOFT HEARTED BOY HUSBAND AN EXPERT FALCONER A DARING HORSEWOMAN AND A FEARLESS DESCENDANT OF THOSE WOMAN WARRIORS OF HER RACE
SHE SAILED FROM THE OLD HARBOR OF ROTTERDAM AND THE LION FLAG OF HER HOUSE SOON FLOATED ABOVE THE LOYAL CITADEL OF GORKUM HER DOUGHTY DUTCH GENERAL VON BREDERODE COUNSELLED IMMEDIATE ATTACK BUT THE GIRL COUNTESS THOUGH FULL OF ENTHUSIASM AND DETERMINATION HESITATED
THAT WERE THEN DISGRACING AND ENDANGERING THE FEEBLE THRONE OF FRANCE THE DREAM OF FUTURE POWER AND GREATNESS AS QUEEN OF FRANCE IN WHICH THE GIRL WIFE OF THE DAUPHIN HAD OFTEN INDULGED WAS THUS RUDELY DISPELLED AND JACQUELINE RETURNED TO HER FATHER'S COURT IN HOLLAND
SHE WHO HAD ONCE BEEN CROWN PRINCESS OF FRANCE AND LADY OF HOLLAND DIED AT THE EARLY AGE OF THIRTY SIX STRIPPED OF ALL HER TITLES AND ESTATES IT IS HOWEVER PLEASANT TO THINK THAT SHE WAS HAPPY IN THE LOVE OF HER HUSBAND
AND THE MERCHANTS OR CODS WITH THEIR SLOUCH HATS OF QUIET GRAY STRUGGLED FOR THE LEAD IN THE STATE AND HOW THEY DID HATE ONE ANOTHER CERTAIN OF THE YOUNGER NOBLES HOWEVER WHO WERE OPPOSED TO THE REIGNING HOUSE OF HOLLAND
HAD DARED TO FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS AGAIN THE REMEMBRANCE OF HOW HIS DARING HAD MADE HIM ONE OF HER HEROES FILLED HER HEART AND A DREAM OF WHAT MIGHT BE POSSESSED HER HER BOY HUSBAND THE FRENCH DAUPHIN WAS DEAD
A MURKY DECEMBER DAY IN THE YEAR FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN THE BATTLE WAS JOINED AS ANNOUNCED ON THE LOW PLAIN BEYOND THE CITY KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS ARCHERS AND SPEARMEN CLOSED IN THE SHOCK OF BATTLE AND A STUBBORN AND BLOODY FIGHT IT WAS
SEVEN TIMES DID THE KNIGHTS OF JACQUELINE GLITTERING IN THEIR STEEL ARMOR CLASH INTO THE REBEL RANKS SEVEN TIMES WERE THEY DRIVEN BACK UNTIL AT LAST THE LORD OF ARKELL WITH A FIERY CHARGE FORCED THEM AGAINST THE VERY GATES OF THE CITADEL
WITH A BOUND HE CLEARED THE INTERVENING SPACE AND CROUCHED AT THE FEET OF THE FAIR YOUNG PRINCESS JACQUELINE
MY LADY COUNTESS FEARS TO FACE MY DETERMINED FOLLOWERS HE THOUGHT LET ME BUT FORCE THIS FIGHT AND THE VICTORY IS MINE IN THAT IS GREATER GLORY AND MORE OF POWER THAN BEING HUSBAND TO THE LADY OF HOLLAND AND SO HE RETURNED A MOST UNGRACIOUS ANSWER
TO BE THE MOST PICTURESQUE FIGURE IN THE HISTORY OF HOLLAND AS SHE HAS BEEN CALLED IS DISTINCTION INDEED BUT HIGHER STILL MUST SURELY BE THAT GENTLENESS OF CHARACTER AND NOBILITY OF SOUL THAT IN THESE DAYS OF OURS
HOW THE FAT DUCHESS OF ENKHUYSEN HAD VIOLATED THE LAWS OF ALL ETIQUETTE BY PLACING THE WRONG NUMBER OF FINGER BOWLS UPON HER TABLE ON SAINT JACOB'S DAY AND HOW THE STOUT YOUNG HUBERT OF MALSEN HAD SCATTERED THE RASCAL MERCHANTS OF DORT AT THEIR SHROVETIDE FAIR
I SAID NOTHING OF HIM MADAM REPLIED COUNT OTTO I DID MEAN THESE YOUNG RED HATS HERE WHO DO NO MORE DARE TO BAIT YOUR FATHER'S LIONS THAN TO FACE THE CODS OF DORT IN FAIR AND EQUAL FIGHT AT THIS BOLD SPEECH THERE WAS INSTANT COMMOTION
THERE STRETCHING OUT INTO THE FLAT COUNTRY BEYOND THE STRAGGLING STREETS OF GORKUM LAY THE TENTS OF THE REBELS AND YET THEY WERE ALL HER COUNTRYMEN REBELS AND RETAINERS ALIKE HOLLANDERS ALL THEY WERE EVER READY TO COMBINE FOR THE DEFENCE OF THEIR HOMELAND
AND OVER ALL THEY HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LORD OF HOLLAND MINGLING COMMENDATION AND PRAISE WITH CENSURE FOR THE RASHNESS OF THEIR ACTION AND IT WAS A RASH AND FOOLISH ACT BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THOSE WERE DAYS WHEN SUCH FEATS WERE ESTEEMED AS BRAVE AND VALOROUS
SEE NOW I WILL FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS THE PRINCESS JACQUELINE SPRANG UP IN PROTEST NO NO YOU SHALL NOT SHE CRIED MY LORD PRINCE DID BUT JEST AS DID WE ALL JOHN SHE SAID TURNING APPEALINGLY TO HER YOUNG HUSBAND WHO SAT SULLEN AND UNMOVED
THE STORY OF HER WOMANHOOD SHOULD INDEED BE TOLD IF WE WOULD STUDY HER LIFE AS A WHOLE BUT FOR US WHO CAN IN THIS PAPER DEAL ONLY WITH HER ROMANTIC GIRLHOOD HER YOUNG LIFE IS TO BE TAKEN AS A TYPE OF THE STIRRING AND EXTRAVAGANT DAYS OF CHIVALRY
AND POINTED SHOES BUT WITHOUT A WORD WITH SCARCE A LOOK TOWARD HIS CHALLENGER HE TURNED TO HIS NEAREST NEIGHBOR A BRAVE ZEALAND LAD AFTERWARD NOTED IN DUTCH HISTORY FRANCIS VON BORSELEN LEND ME YOUR GABARDINE FRIEND FRANZ WILL YOU NOT HE SAID
TELL THE COUNTESS JACQUELINE HE SAID TO THE KNIGHT OF LEYENBURG THAT THE HONOR OF HER HAND I CANNOT ACCEPT I AM HER FOE AND WOULD RATHER DIE THAN MARRY HER ALL THE HOT BLOOD OF HER ANCESTORS FLAMED IN WRATH AS YOUNG JACQUELINE HEARD THIS REPLY OF THE REBEL LORD
SO THIS FLING OF THE DAUPHIN'S CUT DEEP BUT BEFORE THE YOUNG OTTO COULD RETURN AN ANGRY ANSWER JACQUELINE HAD INTERFERED NAY NAY MY LORD SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND THE DAUPHIN T IS NOT A KNIGHTLY ACT THUS TO IMPEACH THE HONOR OF A NOBLE GUEST
NEXT TO HER OWN FEARLESS FATHER NOT THE DAUPHIN JOHN OF FRANCE BUT THIS BRAVE YOUNG REBEL LAD OTTO THE LORD OF ARKELL
AND THE VENGEANCE OF THE COUNTESS WAS SHARP AND MERCILESS BUT IN THE FLUSH OF VICTORY WRATH GAVE WAY TO PITY AGAIN AND THE YOUNG CONQUEROR IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID SADLY AND IN TEARS AH I HAVE WON AND YET HOW HAVE I LOST
FACE YOU THE LIONS LORD COUNT AND I WILL WARRANT ME THEY WILL NOT PROVE AS FORBEARING AS DID SHE IT WAS COMMON TALK AT COUNT WILLIAM'S COURT THAT THE BRAVE LADY OF ARKELL MOTHER OF THE COUNT OTTO HAD MADE HER WAY DISGUISED INTO WE CASTLE OF HER SON
THE YOUNG VON BORSELEN TOOK FROM THE BACK OF THE SETTLE OVER WHICH IT WAS FLUNG HIS GABARDINE THE LONG LOOSE GRAY CLOAK THAT WAS A SORT OF OVERCOAT IN THOSE DAYS OF QUEER COSTUME IT IS HERE MY OTTO HE SAID
BECAUSE OF CERTAIN BOLD ATTEMPTS TO FAVOR THE CODS IN HIS OWN CASTLE OF ARKELL HIS DEFIANT WORDS THEREFORE RAISED A STORM OF PROTESTS
CAME THE STILL HEAVIER BLOW OF HER FATHER'S DEATH ON THE THIRTIETH OF MAY FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN COUNT WILLIAM DIED IN HIS CASTLE OF BOUCHAIN IN HAINAULT AND HIS SORROWING DAUGHTER JACQUELINE NOW A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF SIXTEEN
A CRY OF TERROR BROKE FROM EVERY LIP THE DAUPHIN JOHN TURNED PALE WITH FRIGHT AND COUNT WILLIAM OF HOLLAND CALLING OUT DOWN AJAX BACK GIRL BACK
SO NOW WITH DEFIANCE AND WRATH IN HER FACE SHE DASHED STRAIGHT AT THE FOE HER DISHEARTENED KNIGHTS RALLIED AROUND HER AND FOLLOWING THE IMPETUOUS GIRL THEY WIELDED AXE AND LANCE FOR THE FINAL STRUGGLE THE RESULT CAME QUICKLY
AND THE HAGUE WERE FAST DRAWING TO A CLOSE ON THE FOURTH OF APRIL FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN THE DAUPHIN JOHN DIED BY POISONING IN HIS FATHER'S CASTLE AT COMPIEGNE
OF WHICH COUNT WILLIAM YOUNG JACQUELINE'S FATHER WAS THE HEAD HAD ESPOUSED THE CAUSE OF THE MERCHANTS SEEING IN THEIR SUCCESS GREATER PROSPERITY AND WEALTH FOR HOLLAND AMONG THESE HAD BEEN THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL NOW A SORT OF HALF PRISONER AT COUNT WILLIAM'S COURT
THE BARON OF THE FORESTS OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY A PLAIN DUTCH GENTLEMAN FRANCIS VON BORSELEN THE LAD WHO YEARS BEFORE HAD FURNISHED THE GRAY GABARDINE THAT HAD SHIELDED COUNT WILLIAM'S DAUGHTER FROM HER FATHER'S LIONS
A RAISED GALLERY LOOKED DOWN INTO THE SPACIOUS INCLOSURE IN WHICH COUNT WILLIAM KEPT THE LIVING SPECIMENS OF HIS OWN PRINCELY BADGE OF THE LION AND HERE THE COMPANY GATHERED TO SEE THE SPORT WITH THE GRAY GABARDINE DRAWN BUT LOOSELY OVER HIS SILKEN SUIT SO THAT HE MIGHT IF NEED BE
NOBLES AND PAGES AND LITTLE LADIES IN WAITING AND THERE WAS MUCH OF THE STATELY CEREMONIAL AND FLOWERY TALK THAT IN THOSE DAYS OF KNIGHTHOOD CLOTHED ALIKE THE FEARS OF COWARDS AND THE DESIRES OF HEROES FOR THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HEROES AND COWARDS IN THE WORLD
YOU WHO PRATE SO LOUDLY WOULD BETTER PROVE YOUR WORDS BY SOME SIGN OF YOUR OWN VALOR YOU MAY HAVE DARED FIGHT YOUR LADY MOTHER WHO SO ROUNDLY PUNISHED YOU THEREFOR BUT A LION HATH NOT THE TENDER WAYS OF A WOMAN
SEE LORD OF ARKELL YOU WHO CAN PRATE SO LOUDLY OF CODS AND LIONS HERE BEFORE ALL I DARE YOU TO FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS YOURSELF THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL WAS IN HIS RICH COURT SUIT A TIGHT FITTING GREAT SLEEVED SILK JACKET
THAN DARE ONE OF YOU HERE TO GO DOWN YONDER AMID COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS HAVE A CARE FRIEND OTTO SAID THE LITTLE LADY OF HOLLAND WITH WARNING FINGER THERE IS ONE HERE AT LEAST WHO DARETH TO GO AMID THE LIONS MY FATHER SIR
THE DEATH OF COUNT WILLIAM SHOWED THE CODS A WAY TOWARD GREATER LIBERTY REBELLION FOLLOWED REBELLION AND THE RULE OF THE COUNTESS JACQUELINE WAS BY NO MEANS A RESTFUL ONE AND CHIEF AMONG THE REBELLIOUS SPIRITS AS LEADER AND COUNSELLOR AMONG THE CODS
FOR THE NOBLES AND MERCHANTS OF HOLLAND FOUR CENTURIES AND A HALF AGO WERE AT OPEN STRIFE WITH ONE ANOTHER THE NOBLES SAW IN THE INCREASING PROSPERITY OF THE MERCHANTS THE END OF THEIR OWN FEUDAL POWER AND TYRANNY THE MERCHANTS
WHEN THREATENED BY FOREIGN FOES OR BY THE DESTROYING OCEAN FLOODS JACQUELINE'S EYE CAUGHT THE FLUTTER OF THE BROAD BANNER OF THE HOUSE OF ARKELL THAT WAVED OVER THE REBEL CAMP AGAIN SHE SAW THE BRAVE LAD WHO ALONE OF ALL HER FATHER'S COURT SAVE SHE
THE PONDEROUS BATTLE AXE OF THE KNIGHT OF LEYENBURG CRASHED THROUGH THE HELMET OF THE LORD OF ARKELL AND AS THE BRAVE YOUNG LEADER FELL TO THE GROUND HIS PANIC STRICKEN FOLLOWERS TURNED AND FLED THE TROOPS OF JACQUELINE PURSUED THEM THROUGH THE STREETS OF GORKUM AND OUT INTO THE OPEN COUNTRY
RECOGNIZED IN THE ARROGANT NOBLES THE ONLY BAR TO THE GROWTH OF HOLLAND'S COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE SO EACH FACTION HAD ITS LEADERS ITS PARTISANS ITS BADGES AND ITS FOLLOWERS
TO ACCOMPLISH HER DESIRES PEACE NEVER CAME TO HER HARASSED BY REBELLION AT HOME AND PERSECUTED BY HER RELENTLESS AND PERFIDIOUS UNCLES COUNT JOHN OF BAVARIA RIGHTLY CALLED THE PITILESS AND DUKE PHILIP OF BURGUNDY FALSELY CALLED THE GOOD
CRUSH WE THESE REBEL CURS VON BREDERODE SHE CRIED POINTING TO THE BANNER OF ARKELL FOR BY MY FATHER'S MEMORY THEY SHALL HAVE NEITHER MERCY NOR LIFE FROM ME FAST UPON THE CURT REFUSAL OF THE LORD OF ARKELL CAME HIS MESSAGE OF DEFIANCE HEAR YE COUNTESS OF HOLLAND RANG OUT THE CHALLENGE OF THE
BUT THE DAUPHIN JOHN WAS STRONGER IN TONGUE THAN IN HEART PESTE HE CRIED CONTEMPTUOUSLY T IS A FOOL'S ANSWER AND A FOOL'S WILL
TELL HIM YOU MEANT NO SUCH MURDEROUS TEST MY FATHER SHE CRIED TURNING NOW TOWARD COUNT WILLIAM WHOSE ATTENTION HAD BEEN DRAWN TO THE DISPUTE
AS THE NOBLES OR HOOKS AS THEY WERE CALLED
PULLED THEMSELVES UP SHOOK THEMSELVES AWAKE AND STARED AT THE INTRUDER BOLDLY AND WITHOUT HESITATION WHILE ALL THE WATCHERS HAD EYES BUT FOR HIM ALONE THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO HERCULES THE LARGEST OF THE THREE
A MOMENT'S LEEWAY AND NO MORE BEFORE THE SAVAGE BAND WOULD IMPALE THE FOUR UPON THEIR STONE POINTED SPEARS THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR IDENTITY KNOWN FOR GOD'S SAKE HURRY JIM YELLED IN TODE'S EAR
THEN I SHUT OFF THE POWER AND LET THE WATERS RUSH IN OVER THE ATOM SMASHER AND SWAM ASHORE AND THERE IT LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL AND MAY IT LIE THERE TILL THE JUDGMENT DAY TODE WAS A GENIUS SAID JIM BUT HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT CHARACTER COUNTS FOR MORE THAN GENIUS
YES SIR THAR SURELY IS IN THE HAPPINESS OF BEING BACK ON EARTH ONCE MORE JIM WAS CONTENT TO LET FURTHER EXPLANATIONS GO THE RETURN OF PARRISH HAD BEEN DULY CHRONICLED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND HAD PROVOKED A MILD INTEREST
THEN THE ARMS CAUGHT PRIEST AND DRILGO AND THE STEEL HOOKS DUG DEEP INTO THEIR FLESH A SCREECH OF TERROR A HOWL THAT REVERBERATED THROUGH THE AMPHITHEATRE AND NOTHING REMAINED OF EITHER BUT A HEAP OF MACERATED FLESH
THE FIGHT IN THE DARK HE DROPPED DOWN SOFTLY TO THE CAUSEWAY WITHIN THE CITY HE HEARD A SOUND SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE AS IF SOME ANCIENT PROPHECY OF DOOM HAD BEEN FULFILLED A WAILING
AND JIM UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT SCENE PORTENDED IN DESPAIR AT THE IRRUPTION OF THE DRILGOES THE PRIESTS WERE SEEKING TO PROPITIATE THEIR GODS BY SACRIFICING THE THREE STRANGERS WHOM THEY HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THEIR WOES
NEVER HAS SUCH A SHADOW PLAY BEEN SEEN PERHAPS AS THAT BELOW WHERE DEATH STALKED IN DENSE DARKNESS AND THE SLAYER DID NOT EVEN SEE HIS VICTIM ONLY THE THRUST OF SPEARS THE SOFT YIELDING FLESH THAT THEY ENCOUNTERED
TOGETHER WE'D HAVE MADE OURSELVES MASTERS OF ATLANTIS AND BROUGHT BACK HER PLUNDER TO OUR TWENTIETH CENTURY WORLD YOU REFUSED BECAUSE OF A GIRL A GIRL DENT WHO LOVED ME LONG BEFORE YOU CAME UPON THE SCENE
WHIRLING THE CLUB AROUND HIS HEAD HE FOUGHT BACK THE FANATICS ALL THE WHILE SHOUTING TO TODE TO START THE ATOM SMASHER IN SUCH A MOMENT HE ONLY REMEMBERED THAT TODE WAS A WHITE MAN AND OF HIS OWN GENERATION HE STRUCK DOWN THREE OF THE PRIESTS
BUT OF A SUDDEN LUCILLE'S SCREAM RANG OUT ABOVE THE DIN BELOW WITH THREE LEAPS JIM WAS AT HER SIDE HE SAW THE GIRL TODE AND PARRISH STRUGGLING IN THE GRASP OF A DOZEN PRIESTS THEY WERE DRAGGING THEM TOWARD THE IDOLS
WHICH LED HIM BACK INTO THE CENTRAL PLACE OF ASSEMBLY IT WAS LIKE A NIGHTMARE THAT BLIND SEARCH UNDER THE PALE THREE QUARTER MOON AND THE BLACK STAR BLOTCHED SKY
THAT TOOK A WHOLE YEAR SAID TODE THAT PRETTY LITTLE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION WE'VE JUST WITNESSED THE GOOD OLD ATOM SMASHER HAS BEEN DOING SOME LIVELY STUNTS OR WE'D HAVE BEEN ENGULFED TOO WE'RE NOT LIKELY TO SEE ANYTHING SO PRETTY IN HISTORY AGAIN
SUPPOSE YOU TAKE US BACK TO PECONIC BAY WE'LL DUMP THE ATOM SMASHER INTO THE POND AND TRY TO FORGET THAT WE'VE HAD ANYTHING EXCEPT A BAD NIGHTMARE DON'T TRUST HIM JIM WHISPERED LUCILLE
TODE HAD GOT THE DIALS POINTING TO THE FIFTH DIMENSION ETERNITY HE CALLED IT THOUGH ACTUALLY I BELIEVE IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN ANNIHILATION A GRAND SMASH WELL HE PRESSED THAT LEVER BUT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG
AND HIS CLOTHES BURNED TO CINDERS IT SURE SEEMS STRANGE TO ME TO THINK MISTER PARRISH GOT AWAY SAFE AFTER THAT EXPLOSION FIVE YEARS AGO AND OF HIS WANDERING AROUND WITH LOSS OF MEMORY TILL YOU FOUND HIM AND BRUNG HIM BACK HERE TO RESTORE IT BUT THAR'S STRANGE THINGS IN THE WORLD
MADE ME AND MY WIFE UNEASY THAT DID ANDY SHE SAYS I GOT AN INKLING YOU OUGHTER GO TO THE VANISHING PLACE AND SEE IF SHE AIN'T THERE AND THERE I FOUND YOU TWO MIRED TO THE WAIST AND MISTER PARRISH DANCING AROUND AND FRETTING
JIM THOUGHT HE REMEMBERED WHERE HE WAS BEYOND THAT NEXT HALL THERE SHOULD BE THE TONGUE OF FLOORING CROSSING THE AMPHITHEATRE AND JOINING THE PLATFORM OF THE IDOLS BUT HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS HE EMERGED NOT UPON THE TONGUE BUT UPON STILL ANOTHER STAIRWAY
WELL MISTER DENT MY WIFE AND ME SURE WERE GLAD TO BE ON THE SPOT WHEN YOU AND MISS PARRISH GOT BOGGED ON THE EDGE OF THE BLACK POOL HE SAID MEAN TREACHEROUS PLACE IT IS THAR WAS A COW GOT MIRED THAR LAST MONTH UP TO HER BELLY IF US HADN'T FOUND HER
BUT OVER HIM HE COULD FAINTLY SEE THE STAIRS AND THE BALUSTRADE WINDING AWAY TO WHAT SEEMED IMMEASURABLE HEIGHT THAT STAIRWAY MUST LEAD TO THE TOP OF THE BUILDING AND THENCE THERE SHOULD BE SOME ACCESS TO THE AMPHITHEATRE JIM TURNED TOWARD IT
HE HAD EMERGED UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AMPHITHEATRE UPON THE PLATFORM WHERE HE HAD SEEN THE PRIESTS AND DIGNITARIES GATHERED WHEN HE WAS LED FORWARD TO BE SACRIFICED THERE IN THE REAR WERE THE HIDEOUS SHADOWY GODS LOOMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS
ONLY THE OCEAN WAS TO BE SEEN PLACID BENEATH THE STARS THE ATOM SMASHER WAS VIBRATING AT TREMENDOUS SPEED JIM WITH ONE ARM ROUND LUCILLE FACED TODE AT THE INSTRUMENT BOARD NEAR BY SAT PARRISH WATCHING HIM TOO
HOW ABOUT PICKING UP A LITTLE TREASURE FROM THE HOARDS OF SOLOMON OR GENGHIS KHAN A FEW POUNDS OF PRECIOUS STONES WOULD MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE IN OUR SOCIAL STATUS WHEN WE REACH LONG ISLAND JIM FELT A COLD FURY PERMEATING HIM
IT BURNED HIM TO A FEW GREASE SPOTS HE SIMPLY VANISHED YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID AT THE MOMENT BOY I DON'T SEEM TO REMEMBER ANYTHING SAID JIM WELL YOUR RESPONSE WAS AN AUTOMATIC ONE YOU JUMPED HIM
IT WAS SEALED UP IN WAX AND TODE HAD GOT IT FREE ON THE WAY OUT OF ATLANTIS WELL THIS IT WHAT I MADE OUT FROM EXAMINING THE THING AFTERWARD CAIN HAD BEEN MONKEYING WITH THE LEVER HE'D PRIED LOOSE ONE OF THE WIRES THAT HOOKED TO THE TRANSFORMER
RECHARGING THEMSELVES WITH THE FEEL OF EARTH UNTIL THE MEMORY OF THOSE DREAD EXPERIENCES GREW DIM WELL JIM I RECKON I'D BETTER TELL YOU AND GET IT OVER SAID OLD PARRISH ONE MORNING PARRISH QUITE HIS OLD JAUNTY SELF AGAIN
I MUST HAVE LUCILLE CHOOSE HIS VOICE RANG OUT IN MANIAC TONES CHOOSE ALL OF YOU LUCILLE HAS ANSWERED YOU JIM RETORTED
UNLESS WE GO TO WATCH THE DESTRUCTION OF HERCULANEUM AND POMPEII BY LAVA FROM VESUVIUS BUT THAT WOULD BE QUITE TAME IN COMPARISON WITH THIS TODE'S JEERING TONE GRATED ON JIM'S EARS IMMEASURABLY
THEIR OUTSTRETCHED ARMS INTERLACED AND THERE UPON THE PLATFORM WAS THE ATOM SMASHER A LITTLE THREAD OF VIOLET LIGHT SEEPING OUT OF THE CENTRAL TUBE BESIDE IT STOOD A GROUP OF FIGURES IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH IN THE DARKNESS
YOU REMEMBER HOW POOR CAIN SEEMED TO TAKE GREAT INTEREST IN THE ATOM SMASHER THERE'S NO WAY OF TELLING WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON IN THAT BRAIN OF HIS BUT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE HE'D KNOWN THAT THAT LEVER MEANT DEATH
BUT FORTUNATELY THE PUBLIC MIND WAS SO OCCUPIED AT THE MOMENT WITH THE TRIAL OF A NIGHT CLUB HOSTESS THAT AFTER THE FIRST RUSH OF NEWSPAPER MEN THE THREE WERE LEFT ALONE DAY AFTER DAY IN THE BRILLIANT AUTUMN WEATHER JIM AND LUCILLE WOULD ROAM THE TINTED WOODS
I'LL HAVE TO TRUST YOU BUT I SHALL HAVE MEANS OF EVENING UP IF YOU PLAY CROOKED WHY DON'T YOU ASK MY GIRL HERSELF PIPED OLD PARRISH HE NEEDN'T TROUBLE HE KNOWS THE ANSWER CRIED LUCILLE SCORNFULLY
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE BUT MY IMPRESSION OF IT IS THAT IT'S A FAIRLY GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE PLACE POPULARLY KNOWN AS HELL YOU FOOL DENT TODE'S VOICE RANG OUT WITH VICIOUS SNARLING EMPHASIS I GAVE YOU YOUR CHANCE TO COME IN WITH ME
THE LAST SUDDENLY WITH LOUD YELLS A BAND OF DRILGOES LEAPED FORWARD FROM THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS AND RUSHED UPON THE STRUGGLING PRIESTS AND VICTIMS AND DARK AS IT WAS JIM RECOGNIZED THEIR LEADER CAIN
OLD PARRISH SNAPPED HIS FINGERS BUT YOU MUST HAVE GOT INTO THE FIELD OF MAGNETIC FORCE ANY WAY YOU WERE ALMOST ELECTROCUTED LUCILLE AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD FOR HOURS WE LAID YOU DOWN AND SET A COURSE FOR HOME I USED THOSE DIAL NUMBERINGS TODE HAD GIVEN ME
UTTER IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS REIGNED AND EVEN THE GIBBOUS MOON FLOATING OVERHEAD SEEMED TO GIVE NO LIGHT JIM DROPPED TO THE CAUSEWAY AND BEGAN RUNNING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY
TILL OF A SUDDEN THE PORTALS LOOMED BEFORE HIM AND HE SAW A CROWD OF FRENZIED ATLANTEANS STRUGGLING TO PASS THROUGH AND A FILE OF SOLDIERS STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEM BACK HE COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING MORE THAN THE CONFUSED STRUGGLE
AND LOUDER ABOVE THE SOUND OF WAILING CAME THE ROARS OF THE DRILGOES SWARMING ALONG THE CAUSEWAY SUDDENLY SOMETHING GAVE BEHIND HIM A DOOR AS IT SEEMED BROKEN OFF ITS HINGES BY THE MOB PRESSURE JIM WAS HURLED BACKWARD
SUDDENLY JIM FOUND HIMSELF WEDGED BY THE PRESSURE OF THE CROWD INTO A SORT OF RECESS LEADING OFF THE ELEVATOR COURT SO STRONG WAS THE PRESSURE HERE THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO MOVE AN INCH WEDGED BOLT UPRIGHT HE COULD ONLY WAIT AND LET THE FRENZIED MOB STREAM PAST HIM
THEY HAD A MOMENT'S LEEWAY THE DRILGOES HAD DRIVEN THE PRIESTS BACK INTO THE HOOKS WITH AWFUL SHRIEKS THE FANATICS WERE YIELDING UP THEIR LIVES IN THE PLACE OF THEIR SELECTED VICTIMS BUT MORE DRILGOES WERE POURING UP THE STAIRS
DIDN'T KNOW I'D WORKED THAT OUT DID YOU A PLEASANT LITTLE SURPRISE NO DON'T TRY TO MOVE MY HAND IS ON THE LEVER I HAVE ONLY TO PRESS IT AND WE'RE THERE JIM STOOD STOCK STILL IN HORROR
WITH LUCILLE BESIDE HIM OLD PARRISH FOLLOWING STILL MAKING A FUTILE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WHILE PITIFUL SCREECHES ISSUED FROM HIS MOUTH JIM SAW THE REVOLVING ARMS DESCEND WITHIN A FOOT OF HIS HEAD ONE MORE FIGHT ONE MORE
AND WHERE FIRE AND WATER MET A CLOUD OF STEAM ROSE UP A BOILING CHAOS IN WHICH WATER AND EARTH AND FIRE WERE BLENDED SPREAD OVER LAND AND SEA AND THEN SUDDENLY IT WAS ENDED WHERE THE LAST ISLAND OF THE ATLANTEAN CONTINENT HAD BEEN
THANK YOU HE ANSWERED SCOWLING BUT SERIOUSLY DENT WE CAN'T GO BACK WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR ALL OUR TROUBLE THOSE FOOLS TRIED TO BETRAY ME AND THEN THE EYE WENT OUT PERHAPS I HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR THAT PERFORMANCE
AND IN THE FOREGROUND LUCILLE'S FACE THE GIRL WAS BENDING OVER JIM ONE HAND SOOTHING HIS FOREHEAD WHERE AM I JIM MUTTERED BACK ON EARTH JIM THE GOOD OLD EARTH NEVER AGAIN TO LEAVE IT ANSWERED LUCILLE WITH A CATCH IN HER VOICE
JIM CAUGHT LUCILLE IN HIS ARMS SHOUTING HER NAME SHE KNEW HIM TURNED TOWARD HIM THEN ONE OF THE PRIESTS ARMED WITH A GREAT STONE HEADED CLUB FOR NO METAL IS PERMITTED WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF THE GOD CRUK
THE SCREAM THE WRENCH OF STONE FROM TISSUE AND THE BLENDED HOWL OF TRIUMPH AND SCREAM OF DESPAIR YET ONLY FOR A MOMENT DID JIM TURN HIS EYES UPON THAT SIGHT FOR HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS NOW
BUT BEHIND HIM HE HEARD ANOTHER SOUND AND SHUDDERED AT IT ALL HIS HOPES SUDDENLY REVERSED FOR THAT SOUND WAS THE SHOUTING OF THE DRILGOES AS THEY RUSHED FORWARD TO CONQUEST
A ROAR THAT SEEMED TO REND THE HEAVENS FOLLOWED ROAR UPON ROAR AS THE INFINITE MOMENTUM OF THE DISINTEGRATING URANIUM STRUCK OBSTACLE AFTER OBSTACLE THE DRILGOES VANISHED
HE THRUST HIS ARM INTO HIS BREAST AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE LEVER JIM RECOGNIZED IT AND REMEMBERED IT WAS THE INSTRUMENT OF UNIVERSAL DEATH
THE AMPHITHEATRE MELTED AWAY WALLS AND ROOF OVERHEAD WERE THE MOON AND STARS AND PROUD ATLANTIS WAS SINKING INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA NOT AS A SHIP SINKS BUT PIECEMEAL
IT WAS THE DEATH KEENING OF PROUD ATLANTIS QUEEN OF THE ATLANTIC FOR FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS SHE WAS DYING IN DARKNESS FOR WITH THE BLINDING OF THE EYE ALL THE SOFT LIGHTS WITHIN THE CITY HAD GONE OUT DENSE
INSTEAD JIM FOUND HIMSELF LOOKING DOWN INTO THE AMPHITHEATRE THE THICK WALLS HAD CUT OFF ALL SOUND FROM HIS EARS SAVE A CONFUSED MURMUR BUT NOW A HIDEOUS UPROAR ASSAILED THEM THE WHOLE FLOOR OF THE AMPHITHEATRE WAS A MASS OF MOVING SHADOWS
THE WHEELS WERE REVOLVING A STREAM OF VIOLET LIGHT LEAPING OUT OF THE CENTRAL TUNNEL CAST A LURID ILLUMINATION UPON THE SCENE BUT IT WAS TOO LATE A SCORE OF DRILGOES WITH LEVELED SPEARS WERE RUSHING ON THE FOUR HOLD TIGHT SCREECHED PARRISH
JIM SAW HIM NOW A FIGURE POISED UPON A PLATFORM BEHIND THE ARMS HIS OWN ARMS RAISED HEAVENWARD
HE HAD GONE ASTRAY AND OUT OF HIS BURSTING LUNGS A CRY OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WENT UP FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD STILL WHAT USE TO PROCEED FURTHER AND THEN AMAZINGLY THERE CAME WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SIGN FROM HEAVEN
STRUCK AT HIM FURIOUSLY JIM LEAPED ASIDE LETTING THE CLUB DESCEND HARMLESSLY UPON THE FLOOR HE SHOT OUT HIS RIGHT WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH BEHIND IT CATCHING THE PRIEST UPON THE JAW AND THE MAN CRUMPLED
