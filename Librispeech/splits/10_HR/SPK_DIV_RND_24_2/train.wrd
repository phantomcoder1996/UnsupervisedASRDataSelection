HE WAS MY FRIEND HE HAD NO SECRETS FROM ME AND IF THIS HAD BEEN SO HE WOULD HAVE CONFIDED IN ME AND HE TOLD YOU NOTHING NOT A WORD NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO SUPPOSE NOTHING AND YET YOU SPOKE OF HIM AT ONCE AH IN SUCH A CASE ONE SUPPOSES
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THOROUGHFARES IN THE CITY OF PARIS IN MATTERS OF SPECULATION HOWEVER THOUGH MAN PROPOSES MONEY DISPOSES FROM SOME SUCH DIFFICULTY THE NEWLY NAMED STREET DIED ALMOST IN BIRTH
LISTEN TO ME OUR HOUSE TRANSACTS BUSINESS TO THE AMOUNT OF A MILLION A YEAR FROM WHICH WE DERIVE AN INCOME OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS
HE MEANS THAT THE ARTICLES CONTAINED IN THIS PURSE ARE THE RELICS OF THE ANGEL I SPOKE OF JUST NOW THIS I DO NOT COMPREHEND AND YET I MAY NOT ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BOWING
A SMALL LOW DOOR GAVE EGRESS FROM THE WALLED SPACE WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING INTO THE PROJECTED STREET THE GROUND HAVING BEEN ABANDONED AS UNPRODUCTIVE BY ITS VARIOUS RENTERS
FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL ME DID YOU KNOW THIS ENGLISHMAN BUT YOU TELL ME ALSO THAT THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAVE CONSTANTLY DENIED HAVING RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE YES THEN IS IT NOT PROBABLE THAT THIS ENGLISHMAN MAY BE SOME ONE WHO GRATEFUL FOR A KINDNESS YOUR FATHER HAD SHOWN HIM
WHERE HE RECEIVED HIS FRIENDS HE WAS SUPERINTENDING THE GROOMING OF HIS HORSE AND SMOKING HIS CIGAR AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GARDEN WHEN THE COUNT'S CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE GATE
FORGETTING THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO RENEW THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD CEASED AFTER THE FIRST SALUTATIONS HAD BEEN EXCHANGED THE SILENCE BECAME ALMOST PAINFUL WHEN BY A VIOLENT EFFORT TEARING HIMSELF FROM HIS PLEASING REVERIE
BUT HE NEVER HAS ANY REGARD FOR HIS POOR SISTER PENELON PENELON AN OLD MAN WHO WAS DIGGING BUSILY AT ONE OF THE BEDS STUCK HIS SPADE IN THE EARTH AND APPROACHED CAP IN HAND STRIVING TO CONCEAL A QUID OF TOBACCO HE HAD JUST THRUST INTO HIS CHEEK
I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE RUE MESLAY YOUR FAMILY APPEARS TO BE A VERY HAPPY ONE SAID THE COUNT AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF OH YES I ASSURE YOU COUNT THEY WANT NOTHING THAT CAN RENDER THEM HAPPY
AND WHERE CABBAGES CARROTS RADISHES PEASE AND MELONS HAD ONCE FLOURISHED A SCANTY CROP OF LUCERNE ALONE BORE EVIDENCE OF ITS BEING DEEMED WORTHY OF CULTIVATION
WITH A TONE SO SWEET AND GENTLE THAT IT WENT TO MAXIMILIAN'S HEART LIKE THE VOICE OF A FATHER BUT THEY WILL NOT BE CONTENT WITH THAT YOUR BROTHER IN LAW IS A BARRISTER A DOCTOR HE WAS A MERCHANT MONSIEUR AND HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE BUSINESS OF MY POOR FATHER
MONTE CRISTO ROSE AND WITHOUT MAKING ANY ANSWER FOR THE TREMULOUSNESS OF HIS VOICE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIS EMOTION WALKED UP AND DOWN THE APARTMENT WITH A SLOW STEP OUR MAGNIFICENCE MAKES YOU SMILE COUNT SAID MAXIMILIAN WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES
EVERYTHING IN THIS CHARMING RETREAT FROM THE WARBLE OF THE BIRDS TO THE SMILE OF THE MISTRESS BREATHED TRANQUILLITY AND REPOSE THE COUNT HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THIS HAPPINESS FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND HE REMAINED SILENT AND PENSIVE
AGAIN THE TIMID GIRL FOUND COURAGE TO RETURN TO THE GATE SAYING AS SHE DID SO AND WHY DO YOU COME SO LATE TO DAY IT IS ALMOST DINNER TIME AND I HAD TO USE NO LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO GET RID OF MY WATCHFUL MOTHER IN LAW MY TOO DEVOTED MAID AND MY TROUBLESOME BROTHER
IT IS NEEDLESS TO ADD THAT THERE WERE GOLD AND SILVER FISH IN THE BASIN THE HOUSE WITH KITCHENS AND CELLARS BELOW HAD ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR TWO STORIES AND ATTICS
BUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR HAS HAD A MYSTERIOUS MEANING THAT WE CANNOT COMPREHEND WE HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND A HAND AS POWERFUL AS THAT OF AN ENCHANTER OH CRIED JULIE I HAVE NOT LOST ALL HOPE OF SOME DAY KISSING THAT HAND AS I NOW KISS THE PURSE WHICH HE HAS TOUCHED
FROM PRESUMING TO SULLY THE ARISTOCRATIC ENCLOSURE BELONGING TO THE MANSION THE GATE HAD BEEN BOARDED UP TO A HEIGHT OF SIX FEET TRUE THE PLANKS WERE NOT SO CLOSELY ADJUSTED BUT THAT A HASTY PEEP MIGHT BE OBTAINED THROUGH THEIR INTERSTICES
THAT I CAUSE NO SMALL DISTURBANCE IN YOUR HOUSE LOOK THERE SAID MAXIMILIAN LAUGHING THERE IS HER HUSBAND CHANGING HIS JACKET FOR A COAT
SO I HAVE BECOME A GARDENER AND CONSEQUENTLY ADOPTED THE COSTUME OF MY CALLING WHAT EXCESSIVE NONSENSE YOU TALK MAXIMILIAN NONSENSE PRAY DO NOT CALL WHAT I CONSIDER THE WISEST ACTION OF MY LIFE BY SUCH A NAME
CAREFULLY CLOSING AND SECURING IT AFTER HIM PROCEEDED WITH A HURRIED STEP TOWARDS THE BARRIER AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE EXPECTED THOUGH PROBABLY NOT IN SUCH A COSTUME THE YOUNG WOMAN STARTED IN TERROR AND WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A HASTY RETREAT
THE COUNT'S FEATURES DISPLAYED AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST INTENSE CURIOSITY OH ALL THIS IS A FAMILY HISTORY AS CHATEAU RENAUD TOLD YOU THE OTHER DAY OBSERVED MAXIMILIAN
IS IT NOT WORTH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS TO SAVE OUR FATHER'S NAME FROM THE CHANCES OF EVIL FORTUNE AND FAILURE
THAT COMPLETES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS WE HAD FIXED AS THE LIMITS OF OUR GAINS
DEAREST VALENTINE SAID THE YOUNG MAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR RESPECTIVE STATIONS MAKES ME FEAR TO OFFEND YOU BY SPEAKING OF MY LOVE BUT YET I CANNOT FIND MYSELF IN YOUR PRESENCE WITHOUT LONGING TO POUR FORTH MY SOUL AND TELL YOU HOW FONDLY I ADORE YOU
IF LORD WILMORE WAS YOUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR I FEAR YOU WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN I PARTED FROM HIM TWO YEARS AGO AT PALERMO AND HE WAS THEN ON THE POINT OF SETTING OUT FOR THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS SO THAT I FEAR HE WILL NEVER RETURN
ALAS NO MAXIMILIAN THIS MUST NOT BE FOR MANY REASONS WE SHOULD PRESUME TOO MUCH ON OUR OWN STRENGTH AND LIKE OTHERS PERHAPS BE LED ASTRAY BY OUR BLIND CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER'S PRUDENCE
BUT CONTINUED SHE LORD WILMORE HAD A FAMILY OR FRIENDS HE MUST HAVE KNOWN SOME ONE CAN WE NOT OH IT IS USELESS TO INQUIRE RETURNED THE COUNT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE WAS NOT THE MAN YOU SEEK FOR
NOT ONLY FOR HIS PAST OUTLAY BUT ALSO THE INTEREST UPON THE CAPITAL LOCKED UP IN HIS NEW ACQUISITION CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH LETTING THE GROUND TEMPORARILY TO SOME MARKET GARDENERS AT A YEARLY RENTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
AND SO AS WE HAVE SAID THE IRON GATE LEADING INTO THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAD BEEN CLOSED UP AND LEFT TO THE RUST WHICH BADE FAIR BEFORE LONG TO EAT OFF ITS HINGES WHILE TO PREVENT THE IGNOBLE GLANCES OF THE DIGGERS AND DELVERS OF THE GROUND
I HAVE CHOSEN A TRADE A TRADE OH MAXIMILIAN HOW CAN YOU JEST AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SUCH DEEP CAUSE FOR UNEASINESS HEAVEN KEEP ME FROM JESTING WITH THAT WHICH IS FAR DEARER TO ME THAN LIFE ITSELF
INTO THE LARGE STONE VASES THAT STOOD UPON THE TWO SQUARE PILASTERS OF A CURIOUSLY WROUGHT IRON GATE
OR IN OTHER WORDS PROJECTED A STREET AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN THE STREET WAS LAID OUT A NAME WAS CHOSEN AND POSTED UP ON AN IRON PLATE BUT BEFORE CONSTRUCTION WAS BEGUN
BUT AS HE HAD BUT ONE EYE AND THAT EYE HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT DIM IN THE COURSE OF NINE YEARS
AND HAD NOW FALLEN SO COMPLETELY IN GENERAL ESTIMATION AS TO RETURN NOT EVEN THE ONE HALF PER CENT IT HAD ORIGINALLY PAID TOWARDS THE HOUSE THE CHESTNUT TREES WE HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED ROSE HIGH ABOVE THE WALL
PARDON ME I HAD NO INTENTION OF COMMITTING AN INDISCRETION INDISCRETION OH YOU MAKE US HAPPY BY GIVING US AN EXCUSE FOR EXPATIATING ON THIS SUBJECT IF WE WANTED TO CONCEAL THE NOBLE ACTION THIS PURSE COMMEMORATES WE SHOULD NOT EXPOSE IT THUS TO VIEW
THE CARRIAGES THAT DROVE UP TO THE DOOR WERE COMPELLED TO TURN TO AVOID A FOUNTAIN THAT PLAYED IN A BASIN OF ROCKWORK AN ORNAMENT THAT HAD EXCITED THE JEALOUSY OF THE WHOLE QUARTER
AND THROUGH THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO CHANGE ANY OF THE CUSTOMS OF THEIR PATERNAL HOUSE TAKING SIX YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT LESS SCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EFFECTED IN TWO OR THREE MARSEILLES RESOUNDED WITH THEIR WELL EARNED PRAISES AT LAST ONE DAY EMMANUEL CAME TO HIS WIFE WHO HAD JUST FINISHED MAKING UP THE ACCOUNTS
COME COME SAID MAXIMILIAN I WILL SERVE AS YOUR GUIDE SUCH A MAN AS YOU ARE OUGHT NOT TO BE INTRODUCED BY A SERVANT MY SISTER IS IN THE GARDEN PLUCKING THE DEAD ROSES MY BROTHER IS READING HIS TWO PAPERS THE PRESSE AND THE DEBATS WITHIN SIX STEPS OF HER
PENELON COUNT IS THE OLD SAILOR YOU SAW IN THE GARDEN AND WHO FROM QUARTERMASTER HAS BECOME GARDENER
AN ENGLISHMAN SAID MONTE CRISTO WHO GREW UNEASY AT THE ATTENTION WITH WHICH JULIE LOOKED AT HIM AN ENGLISHMAN YOU SAY YES REPLIED MAXIMILIAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO REPRESENTED HIMSELF AS THE CONFIDENTIAL CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH AT ROME
I KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND AS YOU WISHED AND WAITED NOT FOR THE DECISION OF YOUR HEART OR MY OWN
HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE A LARGE VASE OF JAPAN PORCELAIN FILLED WITH FLOWERS THAT LOADED THE AIR WITH THEIR PERFUME STOOD IN THE SALON JULIE SUITABLY DRESSED AND HER HAIR ARRANGED SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS FEAT IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES RECEIVED THE COUNT ON HIS ENTRANCE
WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN INCREASING BECAME ALARMING HE COULD NOT SPEAK
SAW ON THE QUAY AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS ON THE POINT OF EMBARKING ON BOARD A YACHT AND HE RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE PERSON WHO CALLED ON MY FATHER THE FIFTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE AND WHO WROTE ME THIS LETTER ON THE FIFTH OF SEPTEMBER HE FELT CONVINCED OF HIS IDENTITY BUT HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ADDRESS HIM
HAD LORD WILMORE SEEN WHAT I NOW SEE HE WOULD BECOME ATTACHED TO LIFE FOR THE TEARS YOU SHED WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO MANKIND AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO JULIE WHO GAVE HIM HERS CARRIED AWAY BY THE LOOK AND ACCENT OF THE COUNT
IT OCCURRED TO THE POSSESSOR OF THE PROPERTY THAT A HANDSOME SUM MIGHT BE OBTAINED FOR THE GROUND THEN DEVOTED TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY BUILDING ALONG THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED STREET AND SO MAKING IT A BRANCH OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE ITSELF
SUCH FELICITY SEEMS ABOVE ALL PRICE AS A THING IMPOSSIBLE AND UNATTAINABLE BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I PURCHASE ALL THIS DELIGHT JOY AND HAPPINESS
THEY ARE YOUNG AND CHEERFUL THEY ARE TENDERLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER AND WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR THEY FANCY THEMSELVES AS RICH AS ROTHSCHILD FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS IS NOT A LARGE SUM HOWEVER REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
FOR HE HAS DONE FOR US WHAT HE GRANTS ONLY TO HIS CHOSEN HE SENT US ONE OF HIS ANGELS
WITH ITS THICKLY PLANTED COURT YARD OPENING INTO THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE AND TO THE GARDEN SHUT IN BY THIS GATE WHICH FORMERLY COMMUNICATED WITH A FINE KITCHEN GARDEN OF ABOUT AN ACRE FOR THE DEMON OF SPECULATION DREW A LINE
AND MONSIEUR MAXIMILIAN MORREL WOULD SEE HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO CRIED MORREL THROWING AWAY HIS CIGAR AND HASTENING TO THE CARRIAGE I SHOULD THINK WE WOULD SEE HIM AH A THOUSAND THANKS COUNT FOR NOT HAVING FORGOTTEN YOUR PROMISE
AND THE PURCHASER OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAVING PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR IT AND BEING QUITE UNABLE TO FIND ANY ONE WILLING TO TAKE HIS BARGAIN OFF HIS HANDS WITHOUT A CONSIDERABLE LOSS YET STILL CLINGING TO THE BELIEF THAT AT SOME FUTURE DAY HE SHOULD OBTAIN A SUM FOR IT THAT WOULD REPAY HIM
OH HEAVEN EXCLAIMED JULIE CLASPING HER HANDS IN WHAT DID HE BELIEVE THEN HE DID NOT CREDIT IT AT THE PERIOD WHICH I KNEW HIM SAID MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED TO THE HEART BY THE ACCENTS OF JULIE'S VOICE BUT PERHAPS SINCE THEN HE HAS HAD PROOFS THAT GRATITUDE DOES EXIST
OH MONSIEUR THIS IS CRUEL OF YOU SAID JULIE MUCH AFFECTED AND THE YOUNG LADY'S EYES SWAM WITH TEARS MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO GRAVELY AND GAZING EARNESTLY ON THE TWO LIQUID PEARLS THAT TRICKLED DOWN JULIE'S CHEEKS
DOOMED TO WANT AND WRETCHEDNESS CAN AT PRESENT HEAR EVERY ONE ENVYING OUR HAPPY LOT THIS LETTER AS HE SPOKE MAXIMILIAN DREW A LETTER FROM THE PURSE AND GAVE IT TO THE COUNT THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY HIM THE DAY THAT MY FATHER HAD TAKEN A DESPERATE RESOLUTION
I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD BE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PURSE WITH THE PAPER AT ONE END AND THE LARGE DIAMOND AT THE OTHER COUNT REPLIED MAXIMILIAN WITH AN AIR OF GRAVITY THOSE ARE OUR MOST PRECIOUS FAMILY TREASURES THE STONE SEEMS VERY BRILLIANT ANSWERED THE COUNT
THE INCESSANT AND MELODIOUS WARBLING OF BIRDS AND THE ENTIRE REMOVAL FROM EITHER THE NOISE OF THE STREET OR THE BUSTLE OF THE MANSION ON THE EVENING OF ONE OF THE WARMEST DAYS SPRING HAD YET BESTOWED ON THE INHABITANTS OF PARIS
AND RECIPROCALLY AS THEY SAY AT THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL AT THE SOUND OF THEIR STEPS A YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY TO FIVE AND TWENTY DRESSED IN A SILK MORNING GOWN AND BUSILY ENGAGED IN PLUCKING THE DEAD LEAVES OFF A NOISETTE ROSE TREE RAISED HER HEAD
BUT SUCH AS WE ARE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BITTER SORROWS AND GOD HAS POURED BALM INTO YOUR WOUNDS AS HE DOES INTO THOSE OF ALL WHO ARE IN AFFLICTION SAID MONTE CRISTO INQUIRINGLY YES COUNT RETURNED JULIE WE MAY INDEED SAY HE HAS
HE HAD RESERVED THE HOUSE AND HALF THE GARDEN AND BUILDING A WALL BETWEEN THE GARDEN AND THE WORKSHOPS HAD LET THEM UPON LEASE WITH THE PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
THIS WAS JULIE WHO HAD BECOME AS THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAD PREDICTED MADAME EMMANUEL HERBAULT SHE UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER AND MAXIMILIAN BEGAN TO LAUGH
BUT CONTENTMENT IS SO NEW A SIGHT TO ME THAT I COULD NEVER BE WEARY OF LOOKING AT YOURSELF AND YOUR HUSBAND WE ARE VERY HAPPY MONSIEUR REPLIED JULIE BUT WE HAVE ALSO KNOWN UNHAPPINESS AND FEW HAVE EVER UNDERGONE MORE BITTER SUFFERINGS THAN OURSELVES
THERE WAS A STUDY FOR EMMANUEL WHO NEVER STUDIED AND A MUSIC ROOM FOR JULIE WHO NEVER PLAYED THE WHOLE OF THE SECOND STORY WAS SET APART FOR MAXIMILIAN IT WAS PRECISELY SIMILAR TO HIS SISTER'S APARTMENTS EXCEPT THAT FOR THE BREAKFAST PARLOR HE HAD A BILLIARD ROOM
HENCEFORTH WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR I AM ON MY OWN GROUND AND HAVE AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO PLACE A LADDER AGAINST THE WALL AND TO LOOK OVER WHEN I PLEASE WITHOUT HAVING ANY APPREHENSIONS OF BEING TAKEN OFF BY THE POLICE AS A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER
HIS COAT CLOSELY BUTTONED UP AND CONSTANTLY TAKING OUT HIS PENCIL
AS THEY WAVED THEIR VARIEGATED LEAVES IN THE WIND AND CHARMED THE EYE WITH THEIR SCARLET BLOOM HAD FALLEN INTO UTTER DISUSE THE PROPRIETORS OF THE MANSION HAD MANY YEARS BEFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THE POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE ITSELF
AND IN THE REAR OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPOSING MANSIONS IN THIS RICH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE VARIOUS HOUSES VIE WITH EACH OTHER FOR ELEGANCE OF DESIGN AND MAGNIFICENCE OF CONSTRUCTION EXTENDED A LARGE GARDEN
A FEW LOCKS OF GRAY MINGLED WITH HIS HAIR WHICH WAS STILL THICK AND MATTED WHILE HIS BRONZED FEATURES AND DETERMINED GLANCE WELL SUITED AN OLD SAILOR WHO HAD BRAVED THE HEAT OF THE EQUATOR AND THE STORMS OF THE TROPICS I THINK YOU HAILED ME
MONTE CRISTO FELT TEARS START INTO HIS EYES AND HE AGAIN WALKED HASTILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN SAID MAXIMILIAN IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HIM TELL US WHAT IT IS ALAS CRIED MONTE CRISTO STRIVING TO REPRESS HIS EMOTION
MY FATHER THOUGHT THAT THIS ACTION HAD BEEN MIRACULOUSLY PERFORMED HE BELIEVED THAT A BENEFACTOR HAD ARISEN FROM THE GRAVE TO SAVE US OH IT WAS A TOUCHING SUPERSTITION MONSIEUR AND ALTHOUGH I DID NOT MYSELF BELIEVE IT I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD HAVE DESTROYED MY FATHER'S FAITH
AND DO YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN MONSIEUR INQUIRED EMMANUEL OH IF YOU DO KNOW HIM CRIED JULIE CAN YOU TELL US WHERE HE IS WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM MAXIMILIAN EMMANUEL IF WE DO BUT DISCOVER HIM HE MUST BELIEVE IN THE GRATITUDE OF THE HEART
FOR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY YEARS THAT I HAVE THUS YIELDED TO MY FEELINGS AND HE HASTILY QUITTED THE APARTMENT THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO IS A STRANGE MAN SAID EMMANUEL YES ANSWERED MAXIMILIAN BUT I FEEL SURE HE HAS AN EXCELLENT HEART AND THAT HE LIKES US
AND THAT YOUR FATHER WAS RESOLVED UPON COMPLETING THE MATCH
WHERE THE WIDE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREES RAISED THEIR HEADS HIGH ABOVE THE WALLS IN A SOLID RAMPART AND WITH THE COMING OF EVERY SPRING SCATTERED A SHOWER OF DELICATE PINK AND WHITE BLOSSOMS
UNKNOWN YOU SAY IS THE MAN WHO RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE UNKNOWN TO YOU YES WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE HAPPINESS OF PRESSING HIS HAND CONTINUED MAXIMILIAN WE HAVE SUPPLICATED HEAVEN IN VAIN TO GRANT US THIS FAVOR
ENDEAVORING TO DISCERN SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE BY MEANS OF THE OPENINGS IN THE PLANKS THE EARNESTNESS OF HER ATTITUDE AND THE FIXED GAZE WITH WHICH SHE SEEMED TO SEEK THE OBJECT OF HER WISHES PROVING HOW MUCH HER FEELINGS WERE INTERESTED IN THE MATTER
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY AFFECTING THE GROWTH OF OTHER LUXURIANT SHRUBS AND FLOWERS THAT EAGERLY DRESSED FORWARD TO FILL UP THE VACANT SPACES AS THOUGH ASSERTING THEIR RIGHT TO ENJOY THE BOON OF LIGHT AND AIR AT ONE CORNER
IN WHICH HE OFFERS TO PURCHASE THE GOOD WILL OF THE HOUSE TO UNITE WITH HIS OWN FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ADVISE ME WHAT I HAD BETTER DO
CLAD IN A BLOUSE AND CAP A FAINT CRY OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SURPRISE ESCAPED FROM THE LIPS OF VALENTINE WHO ALMOST INSTANTLY SAID IN A SADDENED TONE AS THOUGH SOME ENVIOUS CLOUD DARKENED THE JOY WHICH ILLUMINED HER HEART
BUT I WISHED TO HAVE YOUR ADVICE IS MY COUNSEL
WHERE THE FOLIAGE BECAME SO THICK AS ALMOST TO SHUT OUT DAY A LARGE STONE BENCH AND SUNDRY RUSTIC SEATS INDICATED THAT THIS SHELTERED SPOT WAS EITHER IN GENERAL FAVOR OR PARTICULAR USE BY SOME INHABITANT OF THE HOUSE
AND THIS DIAMOND WAS GIVEN BY THE GENEROUS UNKNOWN TO MY SISTER AS HER DOWRY MONTE CRISTO OPENED THE LETTER AND READ IT WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF DELIGHT IT WAS THE LETTER WRITTEN AS OUR READERS KNOW TO JULIE AND SIGNED SINBAD THE SAILOR
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO STOP THE ISSUE OF ANY MORE AND CLOSE OUR OFFICE THIS WAS DONE INSTANTLY IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AT A QUARTER PAST A MERCHANT PRESENTED HIMSELF TO INSURE TWO SHIPS IT WAS A CLEAR PROFIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
AND YOU HAVE I AM SURE THE FULLEST CONFIDENCE IN MY HONOR WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME OF EXPERIENCING A VAGUE AND INDEFINITE SENSE OF COMING DANGER I PLACED MYSELF BLINDLY AND DEVOTEDLY AT YOUR SERVICE ASKING NO OTHER REWARD THAN THE PLEASURE OF BEING USEFUL TO YOU
IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ME START WHEN YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY
AND WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN HAS TAKEN THIS METHOD OF REQUITING THE OBLIGATION EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN THIS AFFAIR EVEN A MIRACLE WHAT WAS HIS NAME ASKED MONTE CRISTO HE GAVE NO OTHER NAME ANSWERED JULIE LOOKING EARNESTLY AT THE COUNT
MIGHT BE SEEN NEGLIGENTLY THROWN UPON THE STONE BENCH A BOOK A PARASOL AND A WORK BASKET FROM WHICH HUNG A PARTLY EMBROIDERED CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF WHILE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THESE ARTICLES WAS A YOUNG WOMAN STANDING CLOSE TO THE IRON GATE
RECOLLECT WHAT OUR EXCELLENT FATHER SO OFTEN TOLD US IT WAS NO ENGLISHMAN THAT THUS SAVED US MONTE CRISTO STARTED
BUT THE STRICT DECORUM AND RIGID PROPRIETY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE LEFT NO GROUNDS FOR APPREHENDING THAT ADVANTAGE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HORTICULTURE SEEMED HOWEVER TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED IN THE DESERTED KITCHEN GARDEN
AT LEAST I WAS IN YOUR THOUGHTS YOU ASKED ME THE CAUSE OF MY BEING LATE AND WHY I COME DISGUISED I WILL CANDIDLY EXPLAIN THE REASON OF BOTH
THOSE BORN TO WEALTH AND WHO HAVE THE MEANS OF GRATIFYING EVERY WISH SAID EMMANUEL KNOW NOT WHAT IS THE REAL HAPPINESS OF LIFE JUST AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TOSSED ON THE STORMY WATERS OF THE OCEAN ON A FEW FRAIL PLANKS CAN ALONE REALIZE THE BLESSINGS OF FAIR WEATHER
WHO IS ALWAYS TEASING ME ABOUT COMING TO WORK AT MY EMBROIDERY WHICH I AM IN A FAIR WAY NEVER TO GET DONE SO PRAY EXCUSE YOURSELF AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR HAVING MADE ME WAIT AND AFTER THAT TELL ME WHY I SEE YOU IN A DRESS SO SINGULAR THAT AT FIRST I DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU
LEFT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN MY SISTER AND MYSELF FOR WE WERE HIS ONLY CHILDREN HER HUSBAND WHO WHEN HE MARRIED HER HAD NO OTHER PATRIMONY THAN HIS NOBLE PROBITY HIS FIRST RATE ABILITY AND HIS SPOTLESS REPUTATION WISHED TO POSSESS AS MUCH AS HIS WIFE
WAS ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED IN THE CHOICE BY THE ABSENCE OF ALL GLARE THE COOL REFRESHING SHADE THE SCREEN IT AFFORDED FROM THE SCORCHING RAYS OF THE SUN THAT FOUND NO ENTRANCE THERE EVEN DURING THE BURNING DAYS OF HOTTEST SUMMER
WHICH IS EVIDENTLY NOT HIS REAL NAME BUT A FICTITIOUS ONE THEN NOTICING THAT JULIE WAS STRUCK WITH THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TELL ME CONTINUED HE WAS HE NOT ABOUT MY HEIGHT PERHAPS A LITTLE TALLER WITH HIS CHIN IMPRISONED AS IT WERE IN A HIGH CRAVAT
HOW CAN YOU FOR AN INSTANT ENTERTAIN SO UNWORTHY A THOUGHT DEAR VALENTINE HAVE I NOT FROM THE FIRST BLESSED HOUR OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE SCHOOLED ALL MY WORDS AND ACTIONS TO YOUR SENTIMENTS AND IDEAS
IF IT BE BUT TO CARRY AWAY WITH ME THE RECOLLECTION OF SUCH SWEET MOMENTS I COULD EVEN THANK YOU FOR CHIDING ME FOR IT LEAVES ME A GLEAM OF HOPE THAT IF YOU DID NOT EXPECT ME AND THAT INDEED WOULD BE WORSE THAN VANITY TO SUPPOSE
BUT LISTEN TO ME VALENTINE AND I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT I BECAME WEARY OF RANGING FIELDS AND SCALING WALLS AND SERIOUSLY ALARMED AT THE IDEA SUGGESTED BY YOU THAT IF CAUGHT HOVERING ABOUT HERE YOUR FATHER WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE ME SENT TO PRISON AS A THIEF
WHICH WAS FAINTLY DISCERNIBLE THROUGH THE DENSE MASS OF VERDURE THAT PARTIALLY CONCEALED IT THOUGH SITUATED BUT A HUNDRED PACES OFF WHOEVER HAD SELECTED THIS RETIRED PORTION OF THE GROUNDS AS THE BOUNDARY OF A WALK OR AS A PLACE FOR MEDITATION
ALL OF THE RICHEST AND GLOSSIEST BLACK ILL ACCORDED WITH HIS PLEBEIAN ATTIRE AFTER CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS UNOBSERVED HE ENTERED BY THE SMALL GATE AND
MAXIMILIAN HAD SCARCELY FINISHED HIS STORY DURING WHICH THE COUNT'S HEART HAD SWELLED WITHIN HIM WHEN EMMANUEL ENTERED WEARING A HAT AND COAT HE SALUTED THE COUNT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS AWARE OF THE RANK OF HIS GUEST THEN AFTER HAVING LED MONTE CRISTO AROUND THE LITTLE GARDEN
OH WOULD WE COULD RELATE IT EVERYWHERE AND TO EVERY ONE SO THAT THE EMOTION OF OUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR MIGHT REVEAL HIS PRESENCE
SAID A FEW HURRIED WORDS TO MADAME HERBAULT AND PRESSING THE HANDS OF EMMANUEL AND MAXIMILIAN MADAME SAID HE I TRUST YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO VISIT YOU OCCASIONALLY I VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND FEEL GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR WELCOME
A FRIEND LOST TO HIM FOREVER AND ON HIS DEATH BED WHEN THE NEAR APPROACH OF ETERNITY SEEMED TO HAVE ILLUMINED HIS MIND WITH SUPERNATURAL LIGHT THIS THOUGHT WHICH HAD UNTIL THEN BEEN BUT A DOUBT BECAME A CONVICTION AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE MAXIMILIAN IT WAS EDMOND DANTES
BUT THE EYE OF LOVE HAD ALREADY SEEN EVEN THROUGH THE NARROW CHINKS OF THE WOODEN PALISADES THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHITE ROBE AND OBSERVED THE FLUTTERING OF THE BLUE SASH PRESSING HIS LIPS CLOSE TO THE PLANKS HE EXCLAIMED DON'T BE ALARMED VALENTINE IT IS I
NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO I ONLY GUESSED I KNEW A LORD WILMORE WHO WAS CONSTANTLY DOING ACTIONS OF THIS KIND WITHOUT REVEALING HIMSELF HE WAS AN ECCENTRIC BEING AND DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF GRATITUDE
DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF JULIE SAID HE THE COUNT HAS ONLY BEEN TWO OR THREE DAYS IN PARIS BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS WHAT A FASHIONABLE WOMAN OF THE MARAIS IS AND IF HE DOES NOT YOU WILL SHOW HIM
AT THAT INSTANT THE LITTLE SIDE GATE LEADING FROM THE WASTE GROUND TO THE STREET WAS NOISELESSLY OPENED AND A TALL POWERFUL YOUNG MAN APPEARED HE WAS DRESSED IN A COMMON GRAY BLOUSE AND VELVET CAP BUT HIS CAREFULLY ARRANGED HAIR BEARD AND MUSTACHE
HE LABORED AND TOILED UNTIL HE HAD AMASSED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS SIX YEARS SUFFICED TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECT OH I ASSURE YOU SIR IT WAS A TOUCHING SPECTACLE TO SEE THESE YOUNG CREATURES DESTINED BY THEIR TALENTS FOR HIGHER STATIONS TOILING TOGETHER
THAT WOULD COMPROMISE THE HONOR OF THE FRENCH ARMY TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT THE CONTINUAL PRESENCE OF A CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS IN A PLACE WHERE NO WARLIKE PROJECTS COULD BE SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR IT MIGHT WELL CREATE SURPRISE
THE WHOLE OF THE PROPERTY CONSISTING OF AN IMMENSE WORKSHOP TWO PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN AND THE GARDEN ITSELF HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY EMMANUEL WHO HAD SEEN AT A GLANCE THAT HE COULD MAKE OF IT A PROFITABLE SPECULATION
THERE IS NOTHING NOW TO PREVENT MY BUILDING MYSELF A LITTLE HUT ON MY PLANTATION AND RESIDING NOT TWENTY YARDS FROM YOU ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HAPPINESS THAT WOULD AFFORD ME I CAN SCARCELY CONTAIN MYSELF AT THE BARE IDEA
MONSIEUR RETURNED MAXIMILIAN RAISING THE GLASS COVER AND RESPECTFULLY KISSING THE SILKEN PURSE THIS HAS TOUCHED THE HAND OF A MAN WHO SAVED MY FATHER FROM SUICIDE US FROM RUIN AND OUR NAME FROM SHAME AND DISGRACE A MAN BY WHOSE MATCHLESS BENEVOLENCE WE POOR CHILDREN
CONSIDER BY BECOMING A GARDENER I EFFECTUALLY SCREEN OUR MEETINGS FROM ALL SUSPICION OR DANGER I BESEECH OF YOU MAXIMILIAN TO CEASE TRIFLING AND TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN SIMPLY
MADEMOISELLE JULIE SAID HE PENELON HAD STILL PRESERVED THE HABIT OF CALLING HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER MADEMOISELLE JULIE AND HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THE NAME TO MADAME HERBAULT
AND THE YOUNG OFFICER SHOOK THE COUNT'S HAND SO WARMLY THAT MONTE CRISTO COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS TO THE SINCERITY OF HIS JOY AND HE SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED WITH IMPATIENCE AND WAS RECEIVED WITH PLEASURE
NO NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO PALE AS DEATH PRESSING ONE HAND ON HIS HEART TO STILL ITS THROBBINGS WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE POINTED TO A CRYSTAL COVER BENEATH WHICH A SILKEN PURSE LAY ON A BLACK VELVET CUSHION
THE HOUSE WAS OF WHITE STONE AND IN A SMALL COURT BEFORE IT WERE TWO SMALL BEDS FULL OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS
AN EXPRESSION OF INTENSE HORROR AND ANNOYANCE WAS SEEN ON HIS FACE BUT MARTHA WAS STRONGER THAN HE SHE LIFTED HIM UP AND CARRIED HIM INTO THE HOUSE NONE OF THE CHILDREN WILL EVER FORGET THAT PICTURE
WELL THEN SAID ROBERT LET'S WAKE HIM UP AND SEE WHAT HE'LL DO PERHAPS HE'LL TAKE US TO MAIDSTONE AND STAND SAM HE OUGHT TO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF THOSE EXTRA SPECIAL BAGS WE MUST HAVE DINNER ANYWAY THEY DREW LOTS WITH LITTLE BITS OF BRACKEN
SHOOTING OUT ITS LONG SNAIL'S EYES I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU ALL OF YOU YOU HAVE NO MORE SENSE THAN SO MANY OYSTERS GO ALONG WITH YOU AND CYRIL WENT WHAT AN AWFUL LONG TIME BABIES STAY BABIES
PERHAPS HE WOULD ALSO HAVE TEA THERE PERHAPS SUNSET WOULD COME UPON HIM AMID THE DAZZLING LUXURY OF CLUB LAND AND A HELPLESS CROSS SLEEPY BABY WOULD FIND ITSELF ALONE AMID UNSYMPATHETIC WAITERS AND WOULD WAIL MISERABLY FOR PANTY FROM THE DEPTHS OF A CLUB ARM CHAIR
THE PICTURE MOVED ANTHEA ALMOST TO TEARS OH NO LAMB DUCKY YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT SHE CRIED INCAUTIOUSLY THE GROWN UP LAMB FROWNED MY DEAR ANTHEA HE SAID
SHE EXPLAINED TURNING TO THE LADY WHO WITH TREMBLING HANDS WAS NOW TURNING HER BICYCLE TOWARDS THE GATE AND WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF HIM AND WE MUST GET HIM HOME BEFORE SUNSET OR I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER WILL BECOME OF US YOU SEE HE'S SORT OF UNDER A SPELL ENCHANTED YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
WERE MAKING THE CHILDREN WISE BEYOND THEIR YEARS DEAR HILARY SAID ANTHEA
ONE OF WHOSE NAMES WAS DEVEREUX SAYING ME LOVE PANTY WANTS TO COME TO OWN PANTY OH LET'S GET HOME FOR GOODNESS SAKE SHE SAID YOU SHALL SAY WHATEVER YOU LIKE IN THE MORNING IF YOU CAN SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER
NEVER MIND WHAT NAMES HE WAS CHRISTENED BY AND MARTHA RUSHED AT HIM AND CAUGHT HIM IN HER ARMS EXCLAIMING COME TO HIS OWN MARTHA THEN A PRECIOUS POPPET THE GROWN UP LAMB WHOSE NAMES SHALL NOW BE BURIED IN OBLIVION STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY
YOU'RE VERY KIND SAID THE LADY LOOKING AT THE LAMB SHE LOOKED RATHER SHY BUT AS THE BOYS PUT IT THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY NONSENSE ABOUT HER BUT OH WHISPERED CYRIL BEHIND THE PIG PAIL I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE'D HAD ENOUGH BICYCLE MENDING FOR ONE DAY
AND ELECTRIFIED HER RELATIVES AT DINNER BY TELLING THEM OF HER ESCAPE FROM A FAMILY OF DANGEROUS LUNATICS THE LITTLE GIRL'S EYES WERE SIMPLY THOSE OF A MANIAC I CAN'T THINK HOW SHE CAME TO BE AT LARGE SHE SAID WHEN HER BICYCLE HAD WHIZZED AWAY DOWN THE ROAD
TAKE HIM REPEATED CYRIL YES DO IT'S ALL MY FAULT I DON'T DENY THAT BUT YOU'LL FIND YOU'VE GOT YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU IF YOU TRY TO TAKE THAT YOUNG MAN ANYWHERE THE LAMB ALWAYS WAS SPOILT BUT NOW HE'S GROWN UP HE'S A DEMON SIMPLY
AND COME AND HAVE HIS NICE BREMMILK FORTUNATELY THE SUN SET AS THEY REACHED THE DOORSTEP THE BICYCLE DISAPPEARED AND MARTHA WAS SEEN TO CARRY INTO THE HOUSE THE REAL LIVE DARLING SLEEPY TWO YEAR OLD LAMB THE GROWN UP LAMB NAMELESS HENCE FORTH
A YOUNG MAN WHO WORE THE SAME LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE WHICH JUST BEFORE THEY HAD ACTUALLY SEEN GROWING UPON THE BABY'S LIP THIS THEN WAS THE LAMB GROWN UP THEIR OWN LAMB IT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT
IT WAS A GLOOMY PARTY THAT WENT HOME THROUGH THE SOFT EVENING DURING ANTHEA'S REMARKS ROBERT HAD AGAIN MADE PLAY WITH THE PIN AND THE BICYCLE TYRE AND THE LAMB WHOM THEY HAD TO CALL SAINT MAUR OR DEVEREUX OR HILARY
I WISH TO GOODNESS HE WOULD OH TAKE CARE CRIED ANTHEA IN AN AGONY OF APPREHENSION BUT IT WAS TOO LATE LIKE MUSIC TO A SONG HER WORDS AND CYRIL'S CAME OUT TOGETHER ANTHEA OH TAKE CARE CYRIL GROW UP NOW
HE SAID BITTERLY I SUPPOSE I HAD BETTER TAKE YOU HOME BUT YOU'RE NOT TO SUPPOSE I SHALL PASS THIS OVER
AND THERE BEFORE THE HORRIFIED EYES OF ITS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE LAMB SUDDENLY AND VIOLENTLY GREW UP IT WAS THE MOST TERRIBLE MOMENT THE CHANGE WAS NOT SO SUDDEN AS THE WISH CHANGES USUALLY WERE THE BABY'S FACE CHANGED FIRST
INTO THEIR OWN DEAR TIRESOME BABY BROTHER BUT HE IN HIS GROWN UPNESS INSISTED ON GOING ON AND THUS HE WAS MET IN THE FRONT GARDEN BY MARTHA NOW YOU REMEMBER THAT AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR
CYRIL HAD PERSUADED THE OTHERS TO AGREE TO HIS PLAN AND NOT TO WISH FOR ANYTHING MORE TILL THEY REALLY DID WISH IT MEANTIME IT SEEMED GOOD TO GO TO THE WOODS FOR NUTS AND ON THE MOSSY GRASS UNDER A SWEET CHESTNUT TREE THE FIVE WERE SITTING
TWICE AND THEN OPENED HIS EYES
JANE DOUBTFULLY SUPPOSED SO NOW THE LAMB WHOM I MUST TRY TO REMEMBER TO CALL SAINT MAUR WAS EXAMINING THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND TALKING TO HER WITH A VERY GROWN UP MANNER INDEED NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE SUPPOSED TO SEE AND HEAR HIM
THE LAMB WAS PULLING UP THE MOSS BY FAT HANDFULS AND CYRIL WAS GLOOMILY CONTEMPLATING THE RUINS OF HIS WATCH HE DOES GROW SAID ANTHEA DOESN'T OO PRECIOUS ME GROW
HE WON'T STAND OUR LOOKING AFTER HIM AND IF HE'S STILL A BABY INSIDE OF HIM HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO GET HIM TO DO ANYTHING AND IT'LL BE GETTING ON FOR DINNER TIME IN A MINUTE
CYRIL SPOKE GRAVELY HILARY OLD CHAP HE SAID YOU MUST HAVE HAD A SUNSTROKE OR SOMETHING AND THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN SAYING TO THAT LADY WHY IF WE WERE TO TELL YOU THE THINGS YOU'VE SAID WHEN YOU ARE YOURSELF AGAIN SAY TO MORROW MORNING YOU WOULDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THEM LET ALONE BELIEVE THEM
ROBERT HAD ENOUGH TO EAT AND THAT WAS SOMETHING QUIETLY BUT PERSISTENTLY THE MISERABLE FOUR TOOK IT IN TURNS TO TRY TO PERSUADE THE LAMB OR SAINT MAUR TO SPEND THE REST OF THE DAY IN THE WOODS THERE WAS NOT VERY MUCH OF THE DAY LEFT BY THE TIME HE HAD MENDED THE EIGHTEENTH PUNCTURE
IT GREW THINNER AND LARGER LINES CAME IN THE FOREHEAD THE EYES GREW MORE DEEP SET AND DARKER IN COLOUR THE MOUTH GREW LONGER AND THINNER MOST TERRIBLE OF ALL A LITTLE DARK MOUSTACHE APPEARED ON THE LIP OF ONE WHO WAS STILL EXCEPT AS TO THE FACE
SAID JANE OH BOTHER NUTS SAID ROBERT BUT DINNER'S DIFFERENT
CYRIL DRESSED HASTILY HE DID NOT TAKE A BATH BECAUSE TIN BATHS ARE SO NOISY AND HE HAD NO WISH TO ROUSE ROBERT AND HE SLIPPED OFF ALONE AS ANTHEA HAD ONCE DONE AND RAN THROUGH THE DEWY MORNING TO THE SAND PIT
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME SINCE PEOPLE LEFT OFF EATING REALLY WHOLESOME THINGS HOWEVER HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY GOOD BYE GOOD BYE SAID CYRIL POLITELY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
A TWO YEAR OLD BABY IN A LINEN SMOCK AND WHITE OPEN WORK SOCKS OH I WISH IT WOULDN'T OH I WISH IT WOULDN'T YOU BOYS MIGHT WISH AS WELL THEY ALL WISHED HARD FOR THE SIGHT WAS ENOUGH TO DISMAY THE MOST HEARTLESS
ANTHEA DETACHED A PIN FROM HER WAISTBAND A PIN WHOSE WITHDRAWAL LEFT A GAPING CHASM BETWEEN SKIRT AND BODICE AND HANDED IT FURTIVELY TO ROBERT WITH A GRIMACE OF THE DARKEST AND DEEPEST MEANING ROBERT SLIPPED AWAY TO THE ROAD
YOU KNOW FATHER DIDN'T WISH YOU TO GO TO LONDON HE WOULDN'T LIKE US TO BE LEFT ALONE WITHOUT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF US OH DECEITFUL BEAST THAT I AM SHE ADDED TO HERSELF LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL IF YOU'RE OUR ELDER BROTHER
WHICH WARNED HIM OF THE APPROACH OF THE OTHERS
A FAT LOT OF DINNER WE SHOULD GET IF WE WENT BACK WITHOUT THE LAMB SAID CYRIL IN SCORNFUL MISERY AND IT'LL BE JUST THE SAME IF WE GO BACK WITH HIM IN THE STATE HE IS NOW YES I KNOW IT'S MY DOING DON'T RUB IT IN I KNOW I'M A BEAST AND NOT FIT TO LIVE
HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE INDEED RATHER DIRTY BECAUSE EARLIER IN THE DAY THE LAMB IN HIS INFANT STATE HAD SPRINKLED A GOOD DEAL OF GARDEN SOIL OVER THEM THE GROWN UP LAMB'S VOICE WAS SO TYRANT LIKE AS JANE SAID AFTERWARDS THAT THEY ACTUALLY RETREATED TO THE BACK GARDEN
IT FELL TO JANE'S LOT TO WAKEN THE GROWN UP LAMB SHE DID IT GENTLY BY TICKLING HIS NOSE WITH A TWIG OF WILD HONEYSUCKLE HE SAID
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW WHAT ANSWER THE YOUNG LADY INTENDED TO GIVE TO THIS GALLANT OFFER FOR DIRECTLY ANTHEA HEARD IT MADE SHE RUSHED OUT KNOCKING AGAINST THE PIG PAIL
GO AWAY LITTLE GIRL SAID SAINT MAUR AS WE WILL NOW CALL HIM IN A TERRIBLE VOICE GO HOME AT ONCE YOU'D MUCH BETTER NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM THE NOW RECKLESS ANTHEA WENT ON HE DOESN'T KNOW WHO HE IS HE'S SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU THINK HE IS
A PUNCTURE HE WAS SAYING CAN I NOT BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU COULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A STIFLED EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER BEHIND THE PIG PAIL THE GROWN UP LAMB OTHERWISE DEVEREUX TURNED THE TAIL OF AN ANGRY EYE IN ITS DIRECTION
BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE WISHES OF THE CHILDREN THEREFORE MARTHA MERELY SAW THE USUAL PARTY WITH THE BABY LAMB ABOUT WHOM SHE HAD BEEN DESPERATELY ANXIOUS ALL THE AFTERNOON TROTTING BESIDE ANTHEA ON FAT BABY LEGS WHILE THE CHILDREN OF COURSE STILL SAW THE GROWN UP LAMB
AND WE'LL GO ON THE RIVER AFTERWARDS I'M INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU SAID THE LAMB COURTEOUSLY BUT I SHOULD PREFER SOLITUDE GO HOME TO YOUR LUNCH I MEAN YOUR DINNER PERHAPS I MAY LOOK IN ABOUT TEA TIME
RUN ALONG HOME LIKE GOOD CHILDREN THE POSITION WAS DESPERATE
WAS GONE FOR EVER FOR EVER SAID CYRIL BECAUSE AS SOON AS EVER THE LAMB'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE BULLIED WE MUST JOLLY WELL BEGIN TO BULLY HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE SO THAT HE MAYN'T GROW UP LIKE THAT YOU SHAN'T BULLY HIM SAID ANTHEA STOUTLY
WHAT'S THE GIDDY HOUR YOU'LL BE LATE FOR YOUR GRUB I KNOW WE SHALL SAID ROBERT BITTERLY THEN CUT ALONG HOME SAID THE GROWN UP LAMB WHAT ABOUT YOUR GRUB THOUGH ASKED JANE
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN CYRIL WENT ON IMPATIENTLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS
THE NEAT GREY FLANNEL SUITED GROWN UP YOUNG MAN WITH THE GREEN TIE AND THE LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE FORTUNATELY HE WAS SLIGHTLY BUILT AND NOT TALL STRUGGLING IN THE STURDY ARMS OF MARTHA WHO BORE HIM AWAY HELPLESS IMPLORING HIM AS SHE WENT TO BE A GOOD BOY NOW
AND WHEN EVEN IMMERSION IN A WASH HAND BASIN HAD FAILED TO WASH THE MOULD FROM THE WORKS AND MAKE THE WATCH GO AGAIN CYRIL HAD SAID SEVERAL THINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT BUT NOW HE WAS CALMER AND HAD EVEN CONSENTED TO CARRY THE LAMB PART OF THE WAY TO THE WOODS
YOU CAN TAKE THAT FOR SETTLED AND SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
THE AWFUL THING TO DAY WAS HIS GROWING UP SO SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO TIME TO IMPROVE HIM AT ALL HE DOESN'T WANT ANY IMPROVING SAID ANTHEA AS THE VOICE OF THE LAMB CAME COOING THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR JUST AS SHE HAD HEARD IT IN HER HEART THAT AFTERNOON
LOOK HERE JANE SAID THE GROWN UP LAMB
WHERE ARE YOU GOING OLD MAN YOU MIGHT LET BOBS AND ME COME WITH YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT THE GIRLS THIS WAS REALLY RATHER NOBLE OF CYRIL
AN IMAGINATION OR VOCABULARY GAVE OUT HERE BUT ANYWAY IT WAS THE LONGEST SPEECH THE LAMB HAD EVER MADE AND IT CHARMED EVERYONE EVEN CYRIL WHO TUMBLED THE LAMB OVER AND ROLLED HIM IN THE MOSS TO THE MUSIC OF DELIGHTED SQUEALS
I SUPPOSE HE'LL BE GROWN UP SOME DAY ANTHEA WAS SAYING DREAMILY LOOKING UP AT THE BLUE OF THE SKY THAT SHOWED BETWEEN THE LONG STRAIGHT CHESTNUT LEAVES BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE LAMB
OF COURSE ROBERT UNDERSTOOD AT ONCE THAT IF THE LAMB WAS GROWN UP HE MUST HAVE A BICYCLE THIS HAD ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF ROBERT'S OWN REASONS FOR WISHING TO BE GROWN UP HE HASTILY BEGAN TO USE THE PIN ELEVEN PUNCTURES IN THE BACK TYRE SEVEN IN THE FRONT
YOUR BIKE'S RUN DOWN SAID ROBERT WONDERING HOW HE COULD SO SOON HAVE LEARNED TO DECEIVE SO IT IS SAID CYRIL IT'S A PUNCTURE SAID ANTHEA STOOPING DOWN AND STANDING UP AGAIN WITH A THORN WHICH SHE HAD GOT READY FOR THE PURPOSE LOOK HERE
THE GROWN UP LAMB MOVED GRACEFULLY ACROSS THE MOSS AND SETTLED HIMSELF AGAINST THE TRUNK OF THE SWEET CHESTNUT HE TILTED THE STRAW HAT OVER HIS EYES HE WAS EVIDENTLY WEARY HE WAS GOING TO SLEEP THE LAMB THE ORIGINAL LITTLE TIRESOME BELOVED LAMB
THEY ALL WISHED SO HARD INDEED THAT THEY FELT QUITE GIDDY AND ALMOST LOST CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THE WISHING WAS QUITE VAIN FOR WHEN THE WOOD CEASED TO WHIRL ROUND THEIR DAZZLED EYES WERE RIVETED AT ONCE BY THE SPECTACLE OF A VERY PROPER LOOKING YOUNG MAN IN FLANNELS AND A STRAW HAT
LITTLE GIRLS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD YOU KIDS MUST LEARN NOT TO MAKE YOURSELVES A NUISANCE RUN ALONG HOME NOW AND PERHAPS IF YOU'RE GOOD I'LL GIVE YOU EACH A PENNY TO MORROW LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL IN THE BEST MAN TO MAN TONE AT HIS COMMAND
WITHERED HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH A GLANCE AND THEN SAID TO THE LADY WITH WHOM HE SEEMED TO BE QUITE FRIENDLY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL RIDE WITH YOU AS FAR AS THE CROSS ROADS IT IS GETTING LATE AND THERE ARE TRAMPS ABOUT
HE LOOKED UP FROM THE COMPLETED WORK WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AND SUDDENLY PUT HIS TIE STRAIGHT THERE'S A LADY COMING HE SAID BRISKLY FOR GOODNESS SAKE GET OUT OF THE WAY GO HOME HIDE VANISH SOMEHOW I CAN'T BE SEEN WITH A PACK OF DIRTY KIDS
YES YOU WILL MY LAMB SAID ANTHEA UNDER HER BREATH BUT IT WON'T BE AT ALL THE SORT OF THING YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN HER HEART SHE COULD HEAR THE PRETTY SOFT LITTLE LOVING VOICE OF THE BABY LAMB SO DIFFERENT FROM THE AFFECTED TONES OF THE DREADFUL GROWN UP LAMB
AND THE CHILDREN COULD NOT HEAR WHAT SHE SAID THOUGH THEY WERE CRANING ROUND THE CORNER BY THE PIG PAIL AND LISTENING WITH ALL THEIR EARS THEY FELT IT TO BE PERFECTLY FAIR AS ROBERT SAID WITH THAT WRETCHED LAMB IN THAT CONDITION WHEN THE LAMB SPOKE IN A LANGUID VOICE HEAVY WITH POLITENESS THEY HEARD WELL ENOUGH
THERE WAS A CRACK THE INNOCENT LAMB HAD BROKEN THE GLASS OF FATHER'S SECOND BEST WATERBURY WATCH WHICH CYRIL HAD BORROWED WITHOUT LEAVE GROW UP SOME DAY SAID CYRIL BITTERLY PLUMPING THE LAMB DOWN ON THE GRASS I DARESAY HE WILL WHEN NOBODY WANTS HIM TO
WHO OF COURSE AFTER SUNSET WOULD BE A BABY AGAIN THE MAN TO MAN TONE SUCCEEDED I SHALL JUST RUN OVER TO MAIDSTONE ON MY BIKE SAID THE NEW LAMB AIRILY FINGERING THE LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE I CAN LUNCH AT THE CROWN AND PERHAPS I'LL HAVE A PULL ON THE RIVER
THEIR BEDS SPEAKING GLANCES FLASHED BETWEEN THE WRETCHED FOUR MUCH BED THERE WOULD BE FOR THEM IF THEY WENT HOME WITHOUT THE LAMB WE PROMISED MOTHER NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF YOU IF WE TOOK YOU OUT
BLANK MISERY FELL LIKE A PALL ON THE FOUR OTHERS THE LAMB
AND IF SHE ONLY KNEW THAT REALLY AND TRULY HE'S ONLY A WHINY PINY SILLY LITTLE BABY HE'S NOT ANTHEA MURMURED ANGRILY HE'S A DEAR IF PEOPLE ONLY LET HIM ALONE IT'S OUR OWN PRECIOUS LAMB STILL WHATEVER SILLY IDIOTS MAY TURN HIM INTO ISN'T HE PUSSY
NOW DO BE PERSUADED FOR YOUR OWN GOOD ASK FOR A GOOD FAT MEGATHERIUM AND HAVE DONE WITH IT THANK YOU NOT TO DAY I THINK SAID CYRIL CAUTIOUSLY WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SAY WAS YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS WISHING FOR THINGS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AT ANYTHING
NOT IF I CAN STOP IT WE MUST TAME HIM BY KINDNESS SAID JANE YOU SEE SAID ROBERT IF HE GROWS UP IN THE USUAL WAY
THIS WAS PAID FOR OUT OF THE FIFTEEN SHILLINGS WHICH HAD BEEN EARNED BY ROBERT WHEN HE WAS A GIANT FOR THE LAMB IT APPEARED HAD UNFORTUNATELY NO MONEY ABOUT HIM THIS WAS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE OTHERS BUT IT IS A THING THAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN TO THE MOST GROWN UP OF US HOWEVER
AGAIN AND AGAIN THE LAMB DEVEREUX I MEAN HAD TRIED TO STOP JANE'S ELOQUENCE BUT ROBERT AND CYRIL HELD HIM ONE BY EACH LEG AND NO PROPER EXPLANATION WAS POSSIBLE THE LADY RODE HASTILY AWAY
THE GROWN UP LAMB OR HILARY AS I SUPPOSE ONE MUST NOW CALL HIM FIXED HIS PUMP AND BLEW UP THE TYRE THE PUNCTURED STATE OF IT WAS SOON EVIDENT I SUPPOSE THERE'S A COTTAGE SOMEWHERE NEAR WHERE ONE COULD GET A PAIL OF WATER SAID THE LAMB
I SELDOM PLAY
A RELIC OF FOOLISH AND FAR OFF CHILDHOOD THIS WAS AWFUL HE WAS THEIR ELDER BROTHER NOW WAS HE WELL OF COURSE HE WAS IF HE WAS GROWN UP SINCE THEY WEREN'T THUS
CHAPTER NINE GROWN UP CYRIL HAD ONCE POINTED OUT THAT ORDINARY LIFE IS FULL OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH A WISH WOULD BE MOST USEFUL
IT REPLIED POLITELY AND NOW WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU IT SAID I SUPPOSE YOU'VE COME HERE SO EARLY TO ASK FOR SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF
AND LEFT HIM WITH HIS LITTLE MOUSTACHE AND HIS FLANNEL SUIT TO MEET ALONE THE YOUNG LADY WHO NOW CAME UP THE FRONT GARDEN WHEELING A BICYCLE THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE CAME OUT AND THE YOUNG LADY SPOKE TO HER
ASKED THE LADY NOT UNNATURALLY WHILE DEVEREUX AS I MUST TERM THE GROWN UP LAMB TRIED VAINLY TO PUSH ANTHEA AWAY THE OTHERS BACKED HER UP AND SHE STOOD SOLID AS A ROCK YOU JUST LET HIM GO WITH YOU SAID ANTHEA YOU'LL SOON SEE WHAT I MEAN
AND JUST WHERE WE HAPPEN TO BE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO COME AND DISTURB YOU AGAIN ADDED THE CRAFTY CYRIL IT'LL ONLY END IN YOUR WISHING FOR SOMETHING YOU DON'T REALLY WANT LIKE YOU DID ABOUT THE CASTLE
AND CAUGHT THE LAMB I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO SAY HILARY BY THE ARM THE OTHERS FOLLOWED AND IN AN INSTANT THE FOUR DIRTY CHILDREN WERE VISIBLE BEYOND DISGUISE DON'T LET HIM SAID ANTHEA TO THE LADY AND SHE SPOKE WITH INTENSE EARNESTNESS HE'S NOT FIT TO GO WITH ANYONE
BECAUSE IT SEEMED SO UNFAIR THAT THE BABY WHO HAD ONLY THAT MORNING DESTROYED TWO CHEAP BUT HONEST WATCHES SHOULD NOW IN THE GROWN UPNESS CYRIL'S FOLLY HAD RAISED HIM TO HAVE A REAL GOLD WATCH WITH A CHAIN AND SEALS HILARY AS I WILL NOW TERM HIM
YOU TRUST TO ME OLD CHAP AND COME HOME NOW AND IF YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF IN THE MORNING WE'LL ASK THE MILKMAN TO ASK THE DOCTOR TO COME THE POOR GROWN UP LAMB SAINT MAUR WAS REALLY ONE OF HIS CHRISTIAN NAMES SEEMED NOW TOO BEWILDERED TO RESIST
SOMETIMES CALLED SAINT MAUR IN THESE PAGES I DON'T KNOW HE LIED MISERABLY
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUDDENLY SEE A POOR LITTLE HELPLESS BABY SPINNING ALONG DOWNHILL BESIDE YOU WITH ITS FEET UP ON A BICYCLE IT HAD LOST CONTROL OF THE LADY HAD TURNED RATHER PALE WHO ARE THESE VERY DIRTY CHILDREN SHE ASKED THE GROWN UP LAMB
THERE WAS AND WHEN THE NUMBER OF PUNCTURES HAD BEEN MADE MANIFEST IT WAS FELT TO BE A SPECIAL BLESSING THAT THE COTTAGE PROVIDED TEAS FOR CYCLISTS IT PROVIDED AN ODD SORT OF TEA AND HAMMY MEAL FOR THE LAMB AND HIS BROTHERS
AND THIS THOUGHT FILLED HIS MIND WHEN HE HAPPENED TO WAKE EARLY ON THE MORNING AFTER THE MORNING AFTER ROBERT HAD WISHED TO BE BIGGER THAN THE BAKER'S BOY AND HAD BEEN IT THE DAY THAT LAY BETWEEN THESE TWO DAYS HAD BEEN OCCUPIED ENTIRELY BY GETTING THE GOVERNESS CART HOME FROM BENENHURST
THAT ONLY THAT VERY MORNING HE HAD BEEN A CHUBBY CHILD OF TWO YEARS BREAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S WATERBURY WATCHES DEVEREUX AS HE OUGHT TO BE CALLED FOR THE FUTURE TOOK OUT A GOLD WATCH WHEN HE HAD MENDED THE LADY'S BICYCLE AND ALL THE ONLOOKERS BEHIND THE PIG PAIL SAID OH
SO THE MACHINE WAS WHEELED THE SUN WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF SETTING WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE WHITE HOUSE THE FOUR ELDER CHILDREN WOULD HAVE LIKED TO LINGER IN THE LANE TILL THE COMPLETE SUNSETTING TURNED THE GROWN UP LAMB WHOSE CHRISTIAN NAMES I WILL NOT FURTHER WEARY YOU BY REPEATING
SAID CYRIL AFTER THE LAMB HAD TAKEN HIS WATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET WHILE HE WASN'T NOTICING AND WITH COOS AND CLUCKS OF NAUGHTY RAPTURE HAD OPENED THE CASE AND USED THE WHOLE THING AS A GARDEN SPADE
OR HAD HIS MIND GROWN UP TOGETHER WITH HIS BODY THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH THE OTHERS IN A HURRIED COUNCIL HELD AMONG THE YELLOWING BRACKEN A FEW YARDS FROM THE SLEEPER DEBATED EAGERLY WHICHEVER IT IS IT'LL BE JUST AS AWFUL SAID ANTHEA IF HIS INSIDE SENSES ARE GROWN UP TOO
AS I RECALL NOW MY IMPRESSIONS OF THAT EPISODE I FIND THAT IT WAS ONLY DURING MY MOMENTS OF SELF FORGETFULNESS THAT MY GRIEF WAS WHOLEHEARTED TRUE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE FUNERAL I NEVER CEASED TO CRY
AT LAST MIMI CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE AND FORCED ME TO RETIRE TO BED THAT WAS HOW MY ILLNESS BEGAN AND IT WAS ALL THROUGH MY OWN FAULT THE NEXT DAY I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF FEVER
AND KEPT HEARING STRANGE NOISES IN MY EARS I WOULD BEGIN ONE TWO THREE AND THEN SUDDENLY GO ON EIGHT FIFTEEN AND SO ON AS THOUGH I WERE TALKING NONSENSE AND COULD NOT HELP IT
A PASSION WHICH BEREAVES ME OF PART OF YOUR TENDER AFFECTION AND OBLIGES ME TO TELL YOU SUCH BITTER TRUTHS AS GOD KNOWS WITH WHAT PAIN I AM NOW TELLING YOU I NEVER CEASE TO BESEECH HIM THAT HE MAY PRESERVE US
A GARMENT WHICH WAS TIGHT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND UPON HOW TO AVOID SOILING MY TROUSERS AT THE KNEES ALSO I TOOK THE MOST MINUTE NOTICE OF ALL PRESENT PAPA STOOD AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN
YES IT IS THE HEAVY CROSS WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN US BOTH TO CARRY ALSO YOU WRITE ABOUT THE CHILDREN AND COME BACK TO OUR OLD POINT OF DIFFERENCE BY ASKING MY CONSENT TO YOUR PLACING THEM AT A BOARDING SCHOOL
AND FOR A WHILE I BECAME INSENSIBLE HOW LONG I REMAINED IN THAT CONDITION I DO NOT KNOW NOR YET HOW IT OCCURRED I ONLY KNOW THAT FOR A TIME I LOST ALL SENSE OF EXISTENCE
PERHAPS IT MAY YET BE PERMITTED ME TO EMBRACE AND BLESS THEM IT IS MY LAST WISH THAT IT SHOULD BE SO I KNOW WHAT A TERRIBLE BLOW THIS WILL BE TO YOU BUT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO HEAR IT SOONER OR LATER IF NOT FROM ME
THAT IT HAD SEEN MY SORROW AND PITYING ME HAD RETURNED TO EARTH ON THE WINGS OF LOVE TO CONSOLE AND BLESS ME WITH A HEAVENLY SMILE OF COMPASSION
HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OR BOWED UNTIL HE TOUCHED THE FLOOR WITH HIS HAND A CUSTOM OF THE GREEK FUNERAL RITE OR TOOK THE CANDLE FROM THE PRIEST OR WENT TO THE COFFIN ALL WERE EXCEEDINGLY EFFECTIVE YET FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER
THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT IN ABOUT THREE DAYS TIME I SHALL BE WELL AGAIN AND ABLE TO TAKE THE OPEN AIR AND TO ENJOY THE APRIL SUN NOW AU REVOIR MY DEAREST ONE DO NOT BE ALARMED
KATENKA IS AS CHARMING AS USUAL AND MIMI TOO IS GOOD BUT TIRESOME NOW LET ME SPEAK OF MORE SERIOUS MATTERS YOU WRITE TO ME THAT YOUR AFFAIRS ARE NOT GOING WELL THIS WINTER
HITHERTO GOD HAS LISTENED TO MY PRAYERS YOU HAVE NEVER YET OVERSTEPPED THE LIMIT BEYOND WHICH WE SHOULD BE OBLIGED EITHER TO SACRIFICE PROPERTY WHICH WOULD NO LONGER BELONG TO US BUT TO THE CHILDREN OR
BUT THINKING AT SHE DID SO IN DELIRIUM I WAITED UNTIL THIS MORNING WITH THE INTENTION OF SEALING AND SENDING IT THEN HARDLY HAD I DONE SO WHEN NATALIA NICOLAEVNA ASKED ME WHAT I HAD DONE WITH THE LETTER
I THINK OF GETTING UP TO MORROW ON FRIDAY LAST I TOOK THE GIRLS FOR A DRIVE AND CLOSE TO THE LITTLE BRIDGE BY THE TURNING ON TO THE HIGH ROAD THE PLACE WHICH ALWAYS MAKES ME NERVOUS
THAN I FELT OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN I WAS SO TIRED AND IN THIS WAY HALF AN HOUR PASSED WHILE HELP WAS BEING SENT FOR TO GET THE CARRIAGE DUG OUT I FELT COLD FOR I HAD ONLY THIN BOOTS ON AND THEY HAD BEEN WET THROUGH
HAVE I RECEIVED YOUR DEAR LETTER OF THE THIRD OF APRIL BUT AS USUAL I ANSWER IT AT ONCE
AND FROM THAT THOUGHT I GLEAN SUCH COMFORT THAT I AWAIT THE APPROACH OF DEATH CALMLY AND WITHOUT FEAR YES I AM CALM AND GOD KNOWS THAT I HAVE EVER LOOKED AND DO LOOK NOW
SOME OF THEM IN REFERRING TO OURSELVES CALLED US ORPHANS JUST AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT A MATTER OF COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT CHILDREN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR MOTHER ARE KNOWN AS ORPHANS PROBABLY I THOUGHT
AS I STOOD GRAZING AT IT I AT LAST RECOGNISED THE WELL KNOWN BELOVED FEATURES I SHUDDERED WITH HORROR TO REALISE THAT IT WAS SHE WHY WERE THOSE EYES SO SUNKEN
WHILE I WAS FEVERISH AND DELIRIOUS HE SAT THE WHOLE NIGHT BY MY BEDSIDE WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES AND AT THIS MOMENT SINCE HE KNOWS I AM BUSY WRITING HE IS WITH THE GIRLS IN THE DIVANNAIA
WHY MUST YOU MY HUSBAND EXPERIENCE SUCH A HEAVY AND UNLOOKED FOR BLOW WHY MUST I DIE WHEN YOUR LOVE WAS MAKING LIFE SO INEXPRESSIBLY HAPPY FOR ME BUT HIS HOLY WILL BE DONE
THE NOISE AWAKENED ME AND MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT SEEING ME STANDING ON THE CHAIR IN A POSTURE WHICH HAD NOTHING TOUCHING IN ITS ASPECT
HE MIGHT TAKE ME FOR AN UNFEELING BOY WHO HAD CLIMBED ON TO THE CHAIR OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY WHEREFORE I HASTENED TO MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS TO BEND DOWN MY HEAD AND TO BURST OUT CRYING
I SHALL NOT THINK MUCH OF IT AND YOU NEED NOT BE UNEASY I HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO NO LONGER RELYING SO FAR AS THE CHILDREN ARE CONCERNED UPON YOUR GAINS AT PLAY NOR YET EXCUSE ME FOR SAYING SO
STANDING ON THE CHAIR NEAR THE COFFIN WAS THE PEASANT WOMAN WHILE STRUGGLING AND FIGHTING IN HER ARMS WAS THE LITTLE GIRL AND IT WAS THIS SAME POOR CHILD WHO HAD SCREAMED WITH SUCH DREADFUL DESPERATE FRENZY
THE HORSES AND CARRIAGE STUCK FAST IN THE MUD WELL THE DAY BEING FINE I THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD WALK A LITTLE UP THE ROAD UNTIL THE CARRIAGE SHOULD BE EXTRICATED BUT NO SOONER HAD WE REACHED THE CHAPEL
ON THE CONTRARY I AM PERFECTLY CLEAR AT THIS MOMENT AND ABSOLUTELY CALM NOR MUST YOU COMFORT YOURSELF WITH THE FALSE HOPE THAT THESE ARE THE UNREAL CONFUSED FEELINGS OF A DESPONDENT SPIRIT
AND SHE IS MOST ATTENTIVE AND ATTACHED TO ME SHE EVEN TELLS ME HER SECRET AFFAIRS UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES HER BEAUTIFUL FACE GOOD TEMPER AND YOUTH MIGHT HAVE MADE A MOST EXCELLENT GIRL OF HER
AND AS THOUGH HE WERE STARING AT SOME OBJECT WITH FIXED EYES THEN SUDDENLY HIS LIPS WOULD BEGIN TO QUIVER AND HE WOULD HASTILY MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS AND BEND HIS HEAD AGAIN
FAREWELL WOLODA FAREWELL MY PET FAREWELL MY BENJAMIN MY LITTLE NICOLINKA SURELY THEY WILL NEVER FORGET ME WITH THIS LETTER HAD COME ALSO A FRENCH NOTE FROM MIMI
GO AND RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU WE SHALL ALL OF US BE LONELY SPRING IS COMING IN BEAUTIFULLY WE KEEP THE DOOR ON TO THE TERRACE ALWAYS OPEN NOW WHILE THE PATH TO THE ORANGERY
THEY LIKED TO BE THE FIRST TO GIVE US THAT NAME JUST AS SOME PEOPLE FIND PLEASURE IN BEING THE FIRST TO ADDRESS A NEWLY MARRIED GIRL AS MADAME IN A FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM
IN WHICH THE LATTER SAID THE SAD CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH SHE HAS WRITTEN TO YOU ARE BUT TOO SURELY CONFIRMED BY THE WORDS OF THE DOCTOR YESTERDAY EVENING SHE ORDERED THE LETTER TO BE POSTED AT ONCE
WHY WERE THE LIPS SO WHITE AND THEIR OUTLINE SO BEAUTIFUL SO MAJESTIC SO EXPRESSIVE OF AN UNNATURAL CALM THAT AS I LOOKED AT THEM A CHILL SHUDDER RAN THROUGH MY HAIR
AND DOWN MY BACK SOMEHOW AS I GAZED AN IRREPRESSIBLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE POWER SEEMED TO COMPEL ME TO KEEP MY EYES FIXED UPON THAT LIFELESS FACE I COULD NOT TURN AWAY
THE FACE WHICH I LOVED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN ALL THE WORLD WAS NOW CAPABLE OF INSPIRING HORROR AT LENGTH REVEALED TO ME AS THOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME
OF AN INTEREST WHICH I TOOK IN OBSERVING THE EFFECT PRODUCED UPON OTHERS BY MY TEARS AND OF AN IDLE CURIOSITY LEADING ME TO REMARK MIMI'S BONNET AND THE FACES OF ALL PRESENT
AND TO LOOK MISERABLE YET I FEEL CONSCIENCE STRICKEN WHEN I RECALL THAT GRIEF OF MINE SEEING THAT ALWAYS PRESENT IN IT THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF CONCEIT OF A DESIRE TO SHOW THAT I WAS MORE GRIEVED THAN ANY ONE ELSE
UPON YOUR INCOME THEREFORE YOUR LOSSES CAUSE ME AS LITTLE ANXIETY AS YOUR GAINS GIVE ME PLEASURE WHAT I REALLY GRIEVE OVER IS YOUR UNHAPPY PASSION ITSELF FOR GAMBLING
I FELT A GRUDGE AGAINST HIM FOR THAT VERY ABILITY TO APPEAR EFFECTIVE AT SUCH A MOMENT MIMI STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AS THOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO SUPPORT HERSELF HER DRESS WAS ALL AWRY AND COVERED WITH FEATHERS
AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH TERROR THAT WERE I TO LIVE A HUNDRED YEARS MORE I SHOULD NEVER FORGET IT EVEN NOW THE RECOLLECTION ALWAYS SENDS A COLD SHUDDER THROUGH MY FRAME I RAISED MY HEAD
MIMI'S AND KATENKA'S FORTUNES SECURE FOR EVER MIMI HAD SHED BITTER TEARS WHILE RELATING THIS AND VERY LIKELY HER SORROW IF NOT WHOLLY PURE AND DISINTERESTED WAS IN THE MAIN SINCERE
ALIVE HAPPY AND SMILING THEN SOME WELL KNOWN FEATURE IN THE FACE AT WHICH I WAS GAZING WOULD SUDDENLY ARREST MY ATTENTION AND IN A FLASH I WOULD RECALL THE TERRIBLE REALITY AND SHUDDER
THOUGH STILL UNABLE TO TURN MY EYES AWAY THEN AGAIN THE DREAMS WOULD REPLACE REALITY THEN AGAIN THE REALITY PUT TO FLIGHT THE DREAMS AT LAST THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BOTH LEFT ME
THE LETTER ON THE SIXTEENTH OF APRIL NEARLY SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DAY JUST DESCRIBED PAPA ENTERED OUR SCHOOLROOM AND TOLD US THAT THAT NIGHT WE MUST START WITH HIM FOR OUR COUNTRY HOUSE
AND MY IMAGINATION BEGAN TO PICTURE BEFORE ME SCENES OF HER ACTIVE LIFE AND HAPPINESS I FORGOT THAT THE CORPSE LYING BEFORE ME NOW
MADE FREQUENT SIGNS OF THE CROSS AND PERFORMED MANY GENUFLECTIONS BUT I DID NOT PRAY WITH MY SOUL AND FELT IF ANYTHING ALMOST INDIFFERENT MY THOUGHTS WERE CHIEFLY CENTRED UPON THE NEW COAT WHICH I WAS WEARING
I FELT A PANG AT MY HEART WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS AND MY THOUGHTS AT ONCE TURNED TO MAMMA THE CAUSE OF OUR UNEXPECTED DEPARTURE WAS THE FOLLOWING LETTER PETROVSKOE TWELFTH APRIL ONLY THIS MOMENT
AND THAT YOU WISH TO BREAK INTO THE REVENUES OF CHABAROVSKA IT SEEMS TO ME STRANGE THAT YOU SHOULD THINK IT NECESSARY TO ASK MY CONSENT SURELY WHAT BELONGS TO ME BELONGS NO LESS TO YOU YOU ARE SO KIND HEARTED DEAR
IS DRY AND THE PEACH TREES ARE IN FULL BLOSSOM ONLY HERE AND THERE IS THERE A LITTLE SNOW REMAINING THE SWALLOWS ARE ARRIVING AND TO DAY LUBOTSHKA BROUGHT ME THE FIRST FLOWERS
ONLY NOW DID I UNDERSTAND THE SOURCE OF THE STRONG OPPRESSIVE SMELL WHICH MINGLING WITH THE SCENT OF THE INCENSE FILLED THE CHAMBER WHILE THE THOUGHT THAT THE FACE WHICH BUT A FEW DAYS AGO HAD BEEN FULL OF FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY
KATENKA STOOD NEAR HER MOTHER AND DESPITE HER LENGTHENED FACE LOOKED AS LOVELY AS EVER WOLODA'S FRANK NATURE WAS FRANK ALSO IN GRIEF HE STOOD LOOKING GRAVE
SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS THAT SHE IS BETTER OFF NOW SHE WAS TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD AND SO ON AWAKENED IN ME SOMETHING LIKE FURY WHAT RIGHT HAD THEY TO WEEP OVER OR TO TALK ABOUT HER
DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE JUST WRITTEN TO YOU ABOUT MY ILLNESS IT IS MORE SERIOUS THAN ANY ONE KNOWS I ALONE KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER LEAVE MY BED AGAIN DO NOT THEREFORE DELAY A MINUTE IN COMING HERE WITH THE CHILDREN
SOON I SHALL APPEAR BEFORE GOD HIMSELF TO PRAY THAT HE MAY REWARD YOU FAREWELL MY DEAREST REMEMBER THAT IF I AM NO LONGER HERE
YOU WOULD BE ASTONISHED TO HEAR WHAT PROGRESS SHE HAS MADE BUT IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I FOUND THAT I COULD NOT COUNT THE BEATS SEVERAL TIMES I BEGAN TO DO SO YET ALWAYS FELT CONFUSED IN MY HEAD
AND I CAN HEAR HIM TELLING THEM GERMAN STORIES AND THEM LAUGHING AS THEY LISTEN TO HIM LA BELLE FLAMANDE AS YOU CALL HER IS NOW SPENDING HER SECOND WEEK HERE AS MY GUEST HER MOTHER HAVING GONE TO PAY A VISIT SOMEWHERE
AFTER LUNCHEON TOO I HAD ALTERNATE COLD AND HOT FITS YET STILL CONTINUED TO FOLLOW OUR ORDINARY ROUTINE
LUBOTSHKA IN BLACK GARMENTS AND SUFFUSED WITH TEARS STOOD WITH HER HEAD BOWED UPON HER BREAST SHE RARELY LOOKED AT THE COFFIN YET WHENEVER SHE DID SO HER FACE EXPRESSED A SORT OF CHILDISH FEAR
AND I ONLY NEED YOUR PRESENCE TO REALISE THEM THE REST OF THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN FRENCH AS WELL AS IN A STRANGE UNCERTAIN HAND ON ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER I TRANSCRIBE IT WORD FOR WORD
FOR I FEEL INDEED I KNOW SINCE GOD HAS DEIGNED TO REVEAL IT TO ME THAT I HAVE NOW BUT A VERY SHORT TIME TO LIVE WILL MY LOVE FOR YOU AND THE CHILDREN CEASE WITH MY LIFE I KNOW THAT THAT CAN NEVER BE
THIS IS THE FOURTH DAY THAT I HAVE BEEN IN BED YET DO NOT BE UNEASY I FEEL ALMOST MYSELF AGAIN NOW
THAT MAMMA'S DEATH HAD COME UPON HER AS A BLOW FROM WHICH SHE COULD NEVER HOPE TO RECOVER THAT WITH MAMMA SHE HAD LOST EVERYTHING BUT THAT THE ANGEL AS SHE CALLED MY MOTHER HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HER WHEN AT THE POINT OF DEATH
I MOUNTED A CHAIR TO SEE HER FACE YET WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN I COULD SEE ONLY THAT WAX LIKE TRANSPARENT SOMETHING I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT TO BE HER FACE YET
I CONFESS SAID NATALIA SAVISHNA THAT I TOO FELL ASLEEP IN THE ARM CHAIR AND LET MY KNITTING SLIP FROM MY HANDS SUDDENLY TOWARDS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I HEARD HER SAYING SOMETHING
AND TOLD ME TO BURN IT IF NOT YET DESPATCHED SHE IS FOREVER SPEAKING OF IT AND SAYING THAT IT WILL KILL YOU DO NOT DELAY YOUR DEPARTURE FOR AN INSTANT IF YOU WISH TO SEE THE ANGEL BEFORE SHE LEAVES US PRAY EXCUSE THIS SCRIBBLE
NOR YET AFTER MY DEATH IF GOD SHOULD SEE FIT TO SEPARATE US SHALL SUCH A THING BE DONE ALSO YOU WRITE THAT OUR AFFAIRS RENDER IT INDISPENSABLE FOR YOU TO VISIT SAINT PETERSBURG THE LORD GO WITH YOU
HER SOUL WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND SHE WAS ASKING HIM SOON TO REUNITE HER TO HER WHOM SHE HAD LOVED BEYOND ALL BEINGS ON THIS EARTH AND WHOM SHE STEADFASTLY BELIEVED THAT SHE WOULD VERY SOON MEET AGAIN
UPON DEATH AS NO MORE THAN THE PASSAGE TO A BETTER LIFE YET WHY DO TEARS BLIND MY EYES WHY SHOULD THE CHILDREN LOSE A MOTHER'S LOVE
WHEREUPON I OPENED MY EYES AND LOOKED AT HER MY DARLING WAS SITTING UP IN BED WITH HER HANDS CLASPED TOGETHER AND STREAMS OF TEARS GUSHING FROM HER EYES IT IS ALL OVER NOW SHE SAID
BUT IN THE SOCIETY IN WHICH ACCORDING TO HER OWN ACCOUNT SHE MOVES SHE WILL BE WASTED THE IDEA HAS MORE THAN ONCE OCCURRED TO ME THAT HAD I NOT HAD SO MANY CHILDREN OF MY OWN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEED OF MERCY TO HAVE ADOPTED HER
THAT FOR FEAR OF WORRYING ME YOU CONCEAL THE REAL STATE OF THINGS BUT I CAN GUESS THAT YOU HAVE LOST A GREAT DEAL AT CARDS AS ALSO THAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF MY BEING ANGRY AT THAT YET SO LONG AS YOU CAN TIDE OVER THIS CRISIS
AT TEN O'CLOCK WE WERE SUMMONED TO ATTEND THE PRE FUNERAL REQUIEM THE ROOM WAS FULL OF WEEPING SERVANTS AND PEASANTS WHO HAD COME TO BID FAREWELL TO THEIR LATE MISTRESS DURING THE SERVICE I MYSELF WEPT A GREAT DEAL
AND EXPERIENCED A KIND OF VAGUE BLISSFULNESS WHICH THOUGH GRAND AND SWEET WAS ALSO SAD IT MAY BE THAT AS IT ASCENDED TO A BETTER WORLD HER BEAUTIFUL SOUL HAD LOOKED DOWN WITH LONGING AT THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD LEFT US
SUCH OF THOSE PRESENT AS WERE STRANGERS I FOUND INTOLERABLE
AND I KNOW THAT THAT LOVE WILL EXIST FOR EVER SINCE SUCH A FEELING COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN AWAKENED IF IT WERE NOT TO BE ETERNAL I SHALL NO LONGER BE WITH YOU YET I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MY LOVE WILL CLEAVE TO YOU ALWAYS
I IMAGINE THAT SHE DID THIS TO CHECK HER CONTINUAL SOBBING WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY THE SPECTATORS I REMEMBER TOO HER TELLING PAPA THE EVENING BEFORE
THE CANDLES THE BROCADE THE VELVET THE GREAT CANDELABRA THE PINK SATIN CUSHION TRIMMED WITH LACE THE CHAPLET OF FLOWERS THE RIBBONED CAP AND SOMETHING OF A TRANSPARENT
I STOPPED AT THE DOOR AND TRIED TO LOOK BUT MY EYES WERE SO WEAK WITH CRYING AND MY NERVES SO TERRIBLY ON EDGE THAT I COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING EVERY OBJECT SEEMED TO MINGLE TOGETHER IN A STRANGE BLUR
AND ALL PRESENT EXCEPT OURSELVES WENT TO THE COFFIN TO GIVE HER THE KISS OF FAREWELL ONE OF THE LAST TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER DEPARTED MISTRESS WAS A PEASANT WOMAN WHO WAS HOLDING BY THE HAND
AND ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE OPEN DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM STOOD A GREY OLD WOMAN WITH BENT KNEES WITH HANDS CLASPED TOGETHER AND EYES LIFTED TO HEAVEN SHE PRAYED ONLY NOT WEPT
HE HAS NOT LEFT US SINCE BUT PROMISES SOON TO RESTORE ME TO THE WORLD WHAT A WONDERFUL OLD MAN HE IS
WHAT HAD LAID THAT DREADFUL PALENESS UPON HER CHEEKS AND STAMPED THE BLACK SPOT BENEATH THE TRANSPARENT SKIN ON ONE OF THEM
THE TEARS PREVENT MY WRITING MORE IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN I THANK YOU MY DARLING BEYOND ALL PRICE FOR ALL THE FELICITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE SURROUNDED ME IN THIS LIFE
A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL OF FIVE WHOM SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER GOD KNOWS FOR WHAT REASON JUST AT A MOMENT WHEN I CHANCED TO DROP MY WET HANDKERCHIEF AND WAS STOOPING TO PICK IT UP AGAIN A LOUD PIERCING SCREAM STARTLED ME
I BEG OF YOU EITHER ON ACCOUNT OF MY ILLNESS OR ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR LOSSES AT PLAY END THE CRISIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THEN RETURN HERE WITH THE CHILDREN FOR THE SUMMER I AM MAKING WONDERFUL PLANS FOR OUR PASSING OF IT
BUT AS IT WAS LATE HE DID NOT GIVE IT TO MIMI TILL THIS MORNING AND MIMI SINCE I WAS UNWELL KEPT IT FROM ME ALL DAY I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE FEVERISH IN FACT TO TELL THE TRUTH
YOU KNOW MY OBJECTION TO THAT KIND OF EDUCATION I DO NOT KNOW DEAR WHETHER YOU WILL ACCEDE TO MY REQUEST BUT I NEVERTHELESS BESEECH YOU BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME TO GIVE ME YOUR PROMISE THAT NEVER SO LONG AS I AM ALIVE
AND HER CAP COCKED TO ONE SIDE WHILE HER EYES WERE RED WITH WEEPING HER LEGS TREMBLING UNDER HER AND SHE SOBBED INCESSANTLY IN A HEARTRENDING MANNER AS EVER AND AGAIN SHE BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDKERCHIEF OR HER HANDS
NOT FROM POVERTY FOR WHAT IS POVERTY BUT FROM THE TERRIBLE JUNCTURE WHICH WOULD ARISE SHOULD THE INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN WHICH I AM CALLED UPON TO PROTECT EVER COME INTO COLLISION WITH OUR OWN
YET FOR ALL MY ASKING SHE WOULD SAY NO MORE BEYOND COMMANDING ME TO HAND HER THE LETTER TO THAT LETTER SHE ADDED SOMETHING
THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I DESPISED MYSELF FOR NOT FEELING GRIEF TO THE EXCLUSION OF EVERYTHING ELSE AND THAT I ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL THE FACT SHOWS THAT MY SADNESS WAS INSINCERE AND UNNATURAL
AT LEAST FROM OTHERS LET US TRY TO BEAR THE CALAMITY WITH FORTITUDE AND PLACE OUR TRUST IN THE MERCY OF GOD LET US SUBMIT OURSELVES TO HIS WILL DO NOT THINK THAT WHAT I AM WRITING IS SOME DELUSION OF MY SICK IMAGINATION
AS STRAINING HER TERRIFIED FACE AWAY SHE STILL CONTINUED TO GAZE WITH DILATED EYES AT THE FACE OF THE CORPSE I TOO SCREAMED IN A VOICE PERHAPS MORE DREADFUL STILL AND RAN HEADLONG FROM THE ROOM
I TOOK A DELIGHT IN FEELING THAT I WAS UNHAPPY AND IN TRYING TO FEEL MORE SO CONSEQUENTLY THIS EGOTISTIC CONSCIOUSNESS COMPLETELY ANNULLED ANY ELEMENT OF SINCERITY IN MY WOE
THERE STANDS ONE WHO SINCERELY LOVED HER I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND FELT ASHAMED THE REQUIEM WAS OVER THEY UNCOVERED THE FACE OF THE DECEASED
HE WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW AND ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY RESTRAINED HIS TEARS HIS TALL FIGURE IN ITS BLACK FROCKCOAT HIS PALE EXPRESSIVE FACE THE GRACEFUL ASSURED MANNER IN WHICH AS USUAL
LUBOTSHKA HAD MEANT TO WRITE TO YOU HERSELF BUT SHE HAS TORN UP THREE SHEETS OF PAPER SAYING I KNOW WHAT A QUIZZER PAPA ALWAYS IS IF HE WERE TO FIND A SINGLE FAULT IN MY LETTER HE WOULD SHOW IT TO EVERYBODY
THE THING AT WHICH I WAS GAZING UNCONSCIOUSLY AS AT AN OBJECT WHICH HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH MY DREAMS WAS SHE I FANCIED I COULD SEE HER NOW HERE NOW THERE
AT THIS MOMENT I AM TOO FULL OF THAT LOVE TO BE CAPABLE OF BELIEVING THAT SUCH A FEELING WHICH CONSTITUTES A PART OF MY VERY EXISTENCE CAN EVER PERISH MY SOUL CAN NEVER LACK ITS LOVE FOR YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ON A TABLE LAY THE COFFIN WITH WAX CANDLES BURNING ALL ROUND IT ON TALL SILVER CANDELABRA IN THE FURTHER CORNER SAT THE CHANTER READING THE PSALMS IN A LOW MONOTONOUS VOICE
AND HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS I SPRANG TO MY FEET AND ASKED WHAT THE MATTER WAS AH NATALIA SAVISHNA IF YOU COULD ONLY KNOW WHAT I HAVE JUST SEEN SHE SAID
BUT I HAVE NOT SLEPT NOW FOR THREE NIGHTS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE HER LATER I HEARD FROM NATALIA SAVISHNA WHO PASSED THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT OF THE ELEVENTH APRIL AT MAMMA'S BEDSIDE THAT AFTER WRITING THE FIRST PART OF THE LETTER
THAT NIGHT I SLEPT CALMLY AND SOUNDLY AS IS USUAL AFTER ANY GREAT EMOTION AND AWOKE WITH MY TEARS DRIED AND MY NERVES RESTORED
HE LOOKED JUST LIKE WHAT HE IS A BIG CAT WITH A SHORT TAIL REPLIED JUMPER JUST TO LOOK AT HIM ANY ONE WOULD KNOW HE WAS OWN COUSIN TO BLACK PUSSY HE HAD A ROUND HEAD RATHER LONG LEGS AND WAS ABOUT TWICE AS BIG AS BLACK PUSSY
IN THE GREAT FORESTS OF THE FAR NORTH LIVES YOWLER'S COUSIN TUFTY THE CANADA LYNX ALSO CALLED LOUP CERVIER AND LUCIVEE HE IS NEARLY A THIRD LARGER THAN YOWLER FROM THE TIP OF EACH EAR LONG TUFTS OF BLACK HAIR STAND UP
IN WHICH ALL THINGS OF A SORT ARE LAID BY THEMSELVES AND THITHER EVERY FATHER GOES AND TAKES WHATSOEVER HE OR HIS FAMILY STAND IN NEED OF WITHOUT EITHER PAYING FOR IT OR LEAVING ANYTHING IN EXCHANGE THERE IS NO REASON FOR GIVING A DENIAL TO ANY PERSON
THEY GIVE THEMSELVES A LARGE ALLOWANCE THAT WAY AND INDULGE THEMSELVES IN ALL SUCH PLEASURES AS ARE ATTENDED WITH NO INCONVENIENCE THUS DO THOSE THAT ARE IN THE TOWNS LIVE TOGETHER
HALF WAY HERE I STOPPED FOR A FEW MINUTES IN A THICK CLUMP OF FERNS I WAS JUST ABOUT TO START ON AGAIN WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING MOVING JUST BACK OF AN OLD STUMP
WITHOUT DIMINISHING THEM TOO MUCH WHICH IS SAID TO HAVE FALLEN OUT BUT TWICE SINCE THEY WERE FIRST A PEOPLE WHEN GREAT NUMBERS WERE CARRIED OFF BY THE PLAGUE
IF ALL THOSE WHO LABOUR ABOUT USELESS THINGS WERE SET TO MORE PROFITABLE EMPLOYMENTS AND IF ALL THEY THAT LANGUISH OUT THEIR LIVES IN SLOTH AND IDLENESS EVERY ONE OF WHOM CONSUMES AS MUCH AS ANY TWO OF THE MEN THAT ARE AT WORK WERE FORCED TO LABOUR
WHEN HE HAS LEARNED BOTH HE FOLLOWS THAT WHICH HE LIKES BEST UNLESS THE PUBLIC HAS MORE OCCASION FOR THE OTHER THE CHIEF AND ALMOST THE ONLY BUSINESS OF THE SYPHOGRANTS IS TO TAKE CARE THAT NO MAN MAY LIVE IDLE BUT THAT EVERY ONE MAY FOLLOW HIS TRADE DILIGENTLY
FOR THEY ACCOUNT IT A VERY JUST CAUSE OF WAR FOR A NATION TO HINDER OTHERS FROM POSSESSING A PART OF THAT SOIL OF WHICH THEY MAKE NO USE BUT WHICH IS SUFFERED TO LIE IDLE AND UNCULTIVATED
IN THE SOUTH HE IS QUITE COMMON AND THERE OFTEN STEALS CHICKENS AND TURKEYS EVEN YOUNG PIGS HE PREFERS TO HUNT AT NIGHT BUT SOMETIMES IS SEEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT MISSUS YOWLER'S KITTENS ARE BORN IN A CAVE OR IN A HOLLOW TREE DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE IS AN EXPERT CLIMBER
AGRICULTURE IS THAT WHICH IS SO UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD AMONG THEM THAT NO PERSON EITHER MAN OR WOMAN IS IGNORANT OF IT THEY ARE INSTRUCTED IN IT FROM THEIR CHILDHOOD PARTLY BY WHAT THEY LEARN AT SCHOOL
WITHOUT MUCH REGARD TO THE FINENESS OF THE THREAD
HIS FEET LOOKED BIG EVEN FOR HIM ON THE TIPS OF HIS EARS WERE A FEW LONG BLACK HAIRS HIS COAT WAS YELLOWISH TO REDDISH BROWN WITH DARK SPOTS ON IT HIS CHIN AND THROAT WERE WHITE AND UNDERNEATH HE WAS WHITE SPOTTED WITH BLACK
SHE MAY WITHOUT DISTURBING THE REST RISE AND GO TO THE NURSES ROOM WHO ARE THERE WITH THE SUCKING CHILDREN WHERE THERE IS ALWAYS CLEAN WATER AT HAND AND CRADLES IN WHICH THEY MAY LAY THE YOUNG CHILDREN IF THERE IS OCCASION FOR IT
ONLY IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY SERVE THE PRINCE THE CHIEF PRIEST THE TRANIBORS THE AMBASSADORS AND STRANGERS IF THERE ARE ANY WHICH INDEED FALLS OUT BUT SELDOM
ALL THE UNEASY AND SORDID SERVICES ABOUT THESE HALLS ARE PERFORMED BY THEIR SLAVES BUT THE DRESSING AND COOKING THEIR MEAT AND THE ORDERING THEIR TABLES BELONG ONLY TO THE WOMEN ALL THOSE OF EVERY FAMILY TAKING IT BY TURNS
IS NEGLECTED BY ANOTHER WHO THINKS HE HAS A MORE DELICATE SENSE OF THE BEAUTIES OF ARCHITECTURE AND HE SUFFERING IT TO FALL TO RUIN BUILDS ANOTHER AT NO LESS CHARGE BUT AMONG THE UTOPIANS ALL THINGS ARE SO REGULATED THAT MEN VERY SELDOM BUILD UPON A NEW PIECE OF GROUND
HAD HE KEPT IT STILL I WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN HIM AT ALL BUT HE WAS TWITCHING IT BACK AND FORTH HE WAS CROUCHED DOWN CLOSE TO THE GROUND WITH ALL FOUR FEET DRAWN CLOSE TOGETHER UNDER HIM THERE HE CROUCHED AND THERE I SAT FOR THE LONGEST TIME
WAS THAT ALL OF YOUR ADVENTURE JUMPER NO REPLIED JUMPER I REMAINED RIGHT WHERE I WAS FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT JUST AS DAYLIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO STEAL THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST I DECIDED THAT IT WAS SAFE TO LEAVE MY HIDING PLACE AND COME OVER HERE
YOU KNOW THE MOON WAS VERY BRIGHT LAST NIGHT IT MADE THAT OPEN PLACE IN FRONT OF WHERE I WAS HIDING ALMOST AS LIGHT AS DAY ONCE I CLOSED MY EYES FOR JUST A MINUTE WHEN I OPENED THEM THERE WAS YOWLER SNEAKING ACROSS THAT OPEN PLACE WHERE HE HAD COME FROM I DON'T KNOW
FOR IF THOSE WHO WORK WERE EMPLOYED ONLY IN SUCH THINGS AS THE CONVENIENCES OF LIFE REQUIRE THERE WOULD BE SUCH AN ABUNDANCE OF THEM THAT THE PRICES OF THEM WOULD SO SINK THAT TRADESMEN COULD NOT BE MAINTAINED BY THEIR GAINS
I COULDN'T GET CATS OUT OF MY MIND ALL DAY YESTERDAY BEGAN JUMPER BLACK PUSSY DOESN'T WORRY ME BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT IF THERE IS ANY ONE I FEAR IT IS YOWLER THE BOB CAT JUST THINKING ABOUT HIM MAKE ME NERVOUS THE MORE I TRIED NOT TO THINK ABOUT HIM
EVERY CITY IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR EQUAL PARTS AND IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH THERE IS A MARKET PLACE WHAT IS BROUGHT THITHER AND MANUFACTURED BY THE SEVERAL FAMILIES IS CARRIED FROM THENCE TO HOUSES APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE
FOR IF HE HAD THEM HE WOULD NEITHER BE THE WARMER NOR WOULD HE MAKE ONE JOT THE BETTER APPEARANCE FOR IT AND THUS SINCE THEY ARE ALL EMPLOYED IN SOME USEFUL LABOUR AND SINCE THEY CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH FEWER THINGS IT FALLS OUT THAT THERE IS A GREAT ABUNDANCE OF ALL THINGS AMONG THEM
AS HE LIVES FOR THE MOST PART FAR FROM THE HOMES OF MEN HE DOES LESS DAMAGE TO MAN THAN DOES HIS COUSIN YOWLER THE BOB CAT TUFTY MUST DEPEND WHOLLY FOR HIS LIVING ON THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN FOREST SOMETIMES HE WILL ATTACK A FOX
WHICH IS NO HARD MATTER FOR ANY ONE THAT CAN DO IT OFFERS HERSELF CHEERFULLY FOR AS THEY ARE MUCH INCLINED TO THAT PIECE OF MERCY SO THE CHILD WHOM THEY NURSE CONSIDERS THE NURSE AS ITS MOTHER ALL THE CHILDREN UNDER FIVE YEARS OLD SIT AMONG THE NURSES
BUT THE TIME APPOINTED FOR LABOUR IS TO BE NARROWLY EXAMINED OTHERWISE YOU MAY IMAGINE THAT SINCE THERE ARE ONLY SIX HOURS APPOINTED FOR WORK THEY MAY FALL UNDER A SCARCITY OF NECESSARY PROVISIONS BUT IT IS SO FAR FROM BEING TRUE THAT THIS TIME IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR SUPPLYING THEM WITH PLENTY OF ALL THINGS
WHICH ARE AMONG THE BEST OF THOSE AFFECTIONS THAT ARE BORN WITH US ARE MUCH IMPAIRED BY THE BUTCHERING OF ANIMALS NOR DO THEY SUFFER ANYTHING THAT IS FOUL OR UNCLEAN TO BE BROUGHT WITHIN THEIR TOWNS LEST THE AIR SHOULD BE INFECTED BY ILL SMELLS WHICH MIGHT PREJUDICE THEIR HEALTH
THE REST OF THEIR TIME BESIDES THAT TAKEN UP IN WORK EATING AND SLEEPING IS LEFT TO EVERY MAN'S DISCRETION YET THEY ARE NOT TO ABUSE THAT INTERVAL TO LUXURY AND IDLENESS BUT MUST EMPLOY IT IN SOME PROPER EXERCISE ACCORDING TO THEIR VARIOUS INCLINATIONS
AND FOR WHOM THERE ARE HOUSES WELL FURNISHED PARTICULARLY APPOINTED FOR THEIR RECEPTION WHEN THEY COME AMONG THEM AT THE HOURS OF DINNER AND SUPPER THE WHOLE SYPHOGRANTY BEING CALLED TOGETHER BY SOUND OF TRUMPET
YET THEY DO NOT WEAR THEMSELVES OUT WITH PERPETUAL TOIL FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AS IF THEY WERE BEASTS OF BURDEN WHICH AS IT IS INDEED A HEAVY SLAVERY SO IT IS EVERYWHERE THE COMMON COURSE OF LIFE AMONGST ALL MECHANICS EXCEPT THE UTOPIANS
LIVE STILL IN THE SAME HOUSE IN GREAT OBEDIENCE TO THEIR COMMON PARENT UNLESS AGE HAS WEAKENED HIS UNDERSTANDING AND IN THAT CASE HE THAT IS NEXT TO HIM IN AGE COMES IN HIS ROOM BUT LEST ANY CITY SHOULD BECOME EITHER TOO GREAT OR BY ANY ACCIDENT BE DISPEOPLED
AS THEY NEED LESS WOOLLEN CLOTH THAN IS USED ANYWHERE ELSE SO THAT WHICH THEY MAKE USE OF IS MUCH LESS COSTLY THEY USE LINEN CLOTH MORE BUT THAT IS PREPARED WITH LESS LABOUR AND THEY VALUE CLOTH ONLY BY THE WHITENESS OF THE LINEN OR THE CLEANNESS OF THE WOOL
AND AS MANY VESTS OF SILK WILL SCARCE SERVE ONE MAN AND WHILE THOSE THAT ARE NICER THINK TEN TOO FEW EVERY MAN THERE IS CONTENT WITH ONE WHICH VERY OFTEN SERVES HIM TWO YEARS NOR IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN TEMPT A MAN TO DESIRE MORE
IN SUMMER FOOD IS PLENTIFUL AND TUFTY LIVES WELL BUT IN WINDER TUFTY HAS HARD WORK TO GET ENOUGH RARELY DOES HE KNOW WHAT A FULL STOMACH MEANS THEN LIKE HOWLER HE CAN GO A SURPRISING LENGTH OF TIME WITHOUT FOOD AND STILL RETAIN HIS STRENGTH
THAT THEY MAY APPLY THEMSELVES WHOLLY TO STUDY AND IF ANY OF THESE FALL SHORT OF THOSE HOPES THAT THEY SEEMED AT FIRST TO GIVE THEY ARE OBLIGED TO RETURN TO WORK
THEY HAVE HOWEVER TWO SORTS OF GAMES NOT UNLIKE OUR CHESS THE ONE IS BETWEEN SEVERAL NUMBERS IN WHICH ONE NUMBER AS IT WERE CONSUMES ANOTHER THE OTHER RESEMBLES A BATTLE BETWEEN THE VIRTUES AND THE VICES IN WHICH THE ENMITY IN THE VICES AMONG THEMSELVES AND THEIR AGREEMENT AGAINST VIRTUE
AS TO THEIR CLOTHES OBSERVE HOW LITTLE WORK IS SPENT IN THEM WHILE THEY ARE AT LABOUR THEY ARE CLOTHED WITH LEATHER AND SKINS CUT CARELESSLY ABOUT THEM WHICH WILL LAST SEVEN YEARS AND WHEN THEY APPEAR IN PUBLIC THEY PUT ON AN UPPER GARMENT WHICH HIDES THE OTHER
EVERY FAMILY MAKES THEIR OWN CLOTHES BUT ALL AMONG THEM WOMEN AS WELL AS MEN LEARN ONE OR OTHER OF THE TRADES FORMERLY MENTIONED WOMEN FOR THE MOST PART DEAL IN WOOL AND FLAX WHICH SUIT BEST WITH THEIR WEAKNESS LEAVING THE RUDER TRADES TO THE MEN
AFTER SUPPER THEY SPEND AN HOUR IN SOME DIVERSION IN SUMMER IN THEIR GARDENS AND IN WINTER IN THE HALLS WHERE THEY EAT WHERE THEY ENTERTAIN EACH OTHER EITHER WITH MUSIC OR DISCOURSE THEY DO NOT SO MUCH AS KNOW DICE OR ANY SUCH FOOLISH AND MISCHIEVOUS GAMES
HE DOES MOST OF HIS HUNTING IN JUST THAT WAY SNEAKING ABOUT ON THE CHANCE OF SURPRISING A RABBIT BIRD OR MOUSE OR ELSE PATIENTLY WATCHING AND WAITING BESIDE A HOLE IN WHICH HE KNOWS SOME ONE HAS TAKEN REFUGE
IF THERE IS A TEMPLE WITHIN THE SYPHOGRANTY THE PRIEST AND HIS WIFE SIT WITH THE SYPHOGRANT ABOVE ALL THE REST NEXT THEM THERE IS A MIXTURE OF OLD AND YOUNG WHO ARE SO PLACED THAT AS THE YOUNG ARE SET NEAR OTHERS SO THEY ARE MIXED WITH THE MORE ANCIENT
THE REST OF THE YOUNGER SORT OF BOTH SEXES TILL THEY ARE FIT FOR MARRIAGE EITHER SERVE THOSE THAT SIT AT TABLE OR IF THEY ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THAT STAND BY THEM IN GREAT SILENCE AND EAT WHAT IS GIVEN THEM NOR HAVE THEY ANY OTHER FORMALITY OF DINING
AND THUS THE BUILDERS TO WHOM THAT CARE BELONGS ARE OFTEN WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT EXCEPT THE HEWING OF TIMBER AND THE SQUARING OF STONES THAT THE MATERIALS MAY BE IN READINESS FOR RAISING A BUILDING VERY SUDDENLY WHEN THERE IS ANY OCCASION FOR IT
THE LOSS IS THEN SUPPLIED BY RECALLING AS MANY AS ARE WANTED FROM THEIR COLONIES FOR THEY WILL ABANDON THESE RATHER THAN SUFFER THE TOWNS IN THE ISLAND TO SINK TOO LOW BUT TO RETURN TO THEIR MANNER OF LIVING IN SOCIETY
ON EACH SIDE OF HIS FACE IS A RUFF OF LONG HAIR HIS TAIL IS EVEN SHORTER THAN YOWLER'S AND THE TIP OF IT IS ALWAYS WHOLLY BLACK HIS GENERAL COLOR IS GRAY MOTTLED WITH BROWN HIS FACE RUFF IS WHITE WITH BLACK BORDER
MISTER AND MISSUS TUFTY OFTEN HUNT TOGETHER AND IN EARLY WINTER THE WHOLE FAMILY OFTEN JOIN IN THE HUNT YOWLER AND TUFTY ARE THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE CAT FAMILY NOW FOUND IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY
WHICH THEY SAY WAS APPOINTED ON THIS ACCOUNT THAT THE GRAVITY OF THE OLD PEOPLE AND THE REVERENCE THAT IS DUE TO THEM MIGHT RESTRAIN THE YOUNGER FROM ALL INDECENT WORDS AND GESTURES DISHES ARE NOT SERVED UP TO THE WHOLE TABLE AT FIRST BUT THE BEST ARE FIRST SET BEFORE THE OLD
THIS RULE IS EASILY OBSERVED BY REMOVING SOME OF THE CHILDREN OF A MORE FRUITFUL COUPLE TO ANY OTHER FAMILY THAT DOES NOT ABOUND SO MUCH IN THEM BY THE SAME RULE THEY SUPPLY CITIES THAT DO NOT INCREASE SO FAST FROM OTHERS THAT BREED FASTER AND IF THERE IS ANY INCREASE OVER THE WHOLE ISLAND
THERE WERE SPOTS ALL DOWN HIS LEGS HE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF A TAIL TO CALL IT A TAIL IT WAS WHITISH ON THE UNDER SIDE AND HAD BLACK STRIPES ON THE UPPER SIDE AND ALL THE TIME HE KEPT TWITCHING IT JUST THE WAY BLACK PUSSY TWITCHES HER TAIL WHEN SHE IS OUT HUNTING
BUT IT IS SO SHORT THAT IT IS NOT TEDIOUS NOR UNEASY TO THEM TO HEAR IT FROM HENCE THE OLD MEN TAKE OCCASION TO ENTERTAIN THOSE ABOUT THEM WITH SOME USEFUL AND PLEASANT ENLARGEMENTS
THE OLDEST MAN OF EVERY FAMILY AS HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID IS ITS GOVERNOR WIVES SERVE THEIR HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN THEIR PARENTS AND ALWAYS THE YOUNGER SERVES THE ELDER
THAT AS NONE IS SENT TO THEM AGAINST THEIR WILL SO THERE IS SCARCE ONE IN A WHOLE TOWN THAT IF HE SHOULD FALL ILL WOULD NOT CHOOSE RATHER TO GO THITHER THAN LIE SICK AT HOME
AND THUS FROM THE GREAT NUMBERS AMONG THEM THAT ARE NEITHER SUFFERED TO BE IDLE NOR TO BE EMPLOYED IN ANY FRUITLESS LABOUR YOU MAY EASILY MAKE THE ESTIMATE HOW MUCH MAY BE DONE IN THOSE FEW HOURS IN WHICH THEY ARE OBLIGED TO LABOUR
HE HADN'T MADE A SOUND NOT A LEAF RUSTLED UNDER HIS BIG FEET RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT OPEN PLACE WHERE THE MOONLIGHT WAS BRIGHTEST HE STOPPED TO LISTEN AND I SIMPLY HELD MY BREATH TELL US HOW HE LOOKED PROMPTED OLD MOTHER NATURE
WHOSE SEATS ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE YOUNG AND AFTER THEM ALL THE REST ARE SERVED ALIKE THE OLD MEN DISTRIBUTE TO THE YOUNGER ANY CURIOUS MEATS THAT HAPPEN TO BE SET BEFORE THEM IF THERE IS NOT SUCH AN ABUNDANCE OF THEM THAT THE WHOLE COMPANY MAY BE SERVED ALIKE
AT THAT TIME OF YEAR HE IS A GREAT TRAVELER HE HAS TO BE IN ORDER TO LIVE THERE IS NO FIERCER LOOKING ANIMAL IN ALL THE GREEN FOREST THAN TUFTY THE LYNX BUT DESPITE THIS HE IS LIKE MOST CATS COWARDLY
THE HOSPITALS ARE FURNISHED AND STORED WITH ALL THINGS THAT ARE CONVENIENT FOR THE EASE AND RECOVERY OF THE SICK AND THOSE THAT ARE PUT IN THEM ARE LOOKED AFTER WITH SUCH TENDER AND WATCHFUL CARE AND ARE SO CONSTANTLY ATTENDED BY THEIR SKILFUL PHYSICIANS
SINCE EVERY MAN HAS BY THE LAW OF NATURE A RIGHT TO SUCH A WASTE PORTION OF THE EARTH AS IS NECESSARY FOR HIS SUBSISTENCE IF AN ACCIDENT HAS SO LESSENED THE NUMBER OF THE INHABITANTS OF ANY OF THEIR TOWNS THAT IT CANNOT BE MADE UP FROM THE OTHER TOWNS OF THE ISLAND
THEY NEVER SUP WITHOUT MUSIC AND THERE IS ALWAYS FRUIT SERVED UP AFTER MEAT WHILE THEY ARE AT TABLE SOME BURN PERFUMES AND SPRINKLE ABOUT FRAGRANT OINTMENTS AND SWEET WATERS IN SHORT THEY WANT NOTHING THAT MAY CHEER UP THEIR SPIRITS
ONLY WHEN CORNERED WILL HE FIGHT HE IS POSSESSED OF A LIVELY CURIOSITY AND OFTEN HE WILL STEALTHILY FOLLOW A HUNTER OR TRAPPER FOR MILES THE FUR OF HIS COAT IS VERY LONG AND HANDSOME AND HE IS HUNTED AND TRAPPED FOR THIS
OLD PASTURES AND PLACES WHERE THERE ARE GREAT MASSES OF BRIARS ROCKY LEDGES WHERE THERE ARE CAVES IN WHICH TO HIDE AND PLENTY OF BRUSH ALSO SUIT HIM HE IS A COWARD BUT WHEN CORNERED WILL FIGHT THOUGH HE WILL RUN FROM A LITTLE DOG HALF HIS SIZE AND TAKE TO A TREE
THEY SIT AT THREE OR MORE TABLES ACCORDING TO THEIR NUMBER THE MEN SIT TOWARDS THE WALL AND THE WOMEN SIT ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT IF ANY OF THEM SHOULD BE TAKEN SUDDENLY ILL WHICH IS NO UNCOMMON CASE AMONGST WOMEN WITH CHILD
WITHOUT ANY OTHER DISTINCTION EXCEPT WHAT IS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH THE TWO SEXES AND THE MARRIED AND UNMARRIED THE FASHION NEVER ALTERS AND AS IT IS NEITHER DISAGREEABLE NOR UNEASY SO IT IS SUITED TO THE CLIMATE AND CALCULATED BOTH FOR THEIR SUMMERS AND WINTERS
THERE ARE ALSO WITHOUT THEIR TOWNS PLACES APPOINTED NEAR SOME RUNNING WATER FOR KILLING THEIR BEASTS AND FOR WASHING AWAY THEIR FILTH WHICH IS DONE BY THEIR SLAVES FOR THEY SUFFER NONE OF THEIR CITIZENS TO KILL THEIR CATTLE BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT PITY AND GOOD NATURE
THEN CONSIDER HOW FEW OF THOSE THAT WORK ARE EMPLOYED IN LABOURS THAT ARE OF REAL SERVICE FOR WE WHO MEASURE ALL THINGS BY MONEY GIVE RISE TO MANY TRADES THAT ARE BOTH VAIN AND SUPERFLUOUS AND SERVE ONLY TO SUPPORT RIOT AND LUXURY
THUS OLD MEN ARE HONOURED WITH A PARTICULAR RESPECT YET ALL THE REST FARE AS WELL AS THEY BOTH DINNER AND SUPPER ARE BEGUN WITH SOME LECTURE OF MORALITY THAT IS READ TO THEM
IN THESE HALLS THEY ALL MEET AND HAVE THEIR REPASTS THE STEWARDS OF EVERY ONE OF THEM COME TO THE MARKET PLACE AT AN APPOINTED HOUR AND ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THOSE THAT BELONG TO THE HALL THEY CARRY HOME PROVISIONS
ADD TO THESE ALL THOSE STRONG AND LUSTY BEGGARS THAT GO ABOUT PRETENDING SOME DISEASE IN EXCUSE FOR THEIR BEGGING AND UPON THE WHOLE ACCOUNT YOU WILL FIND THAT THE NUMBER OF THOSE BY WHOSE LABOURS MANKIND IS SUPPLIED IS MUCH LESS THAN YOU PERHAPS IMAGINED
AND A FIRE THAT THEY MAY SHIFT AND DRESS THEM BEFORE IT EVERY CHILD IS NURSED BY ITS OWN MOTHER IF DEATH OR SICKNESS DOES NOT INTERVENE AND IN THAT CASE THE SYPHOGRANTS WIVES FIND OUT A NURSE QUICKLY
IN EVERY STREET THERE ARE GREAT HALLS THAT LIE AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER DISTINGUISHED BY PARTICULAR NAMES THE SYPHOGRANTS DWELL IN THOSE THAT ARE SET OVER THIRTY FAMILIES FIFTEEN LYING ON ONE SIDE OF IT AND AS MANY ON THE OTHER
AND WHERE THEY DO THAT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THEY QUICKLY ENTER INTO THEIR METHOD OF LIFE AND CONFORM TO THEIR RULES AND THIS PROVES A HAPPINESS TO BOTH NATIONS FOR ACCORDING TO THEIR CONSTITUTION SUCH CARE IS TAKEN OF THE SOIL THAT IT BECOMES FRUITFUL ENOUGH FOR BOTH
YOU CAN SCARCE FIND FIVE HUNDRED EITHER MEN OR WOMEN BY THEIR AGE AND STRENGTH CAPABLE OF LABOUR THAT ARE NOT ENGAGED IN IT EVEN THE SYPHOGRANTS THOUGH EXCUSED BY THE LAW YET DO NOT EXCUSE THEMSELVES
BUT THEY DIVIDING THE DAY AND NIGHT INTO TWENTY FOUR HOURS APPOINT SIX OF THESE FOR WORK THREE OF WHICH ARE BEFORE DINNER AND THREE AFTER THEY THEN SUP AND AT EIGHT O'CLOCK COUNTING FROM NOON GO TO BED AND SLEEP EIGHT HOURS
THEY MEET AND EAT TOGETHER EXCEPT ONLY SUCH AS ARE IN THE HOSPITALS OR LIE SICK AT HOME YET AFTER THE HALLS ARE SERVED NO MAN IS HINDERED TO CARRY PROVISIONS HOME FROM THE MARKET PLACE FOR THEY KNOW THAT NONE DOES THAT BUT FOR SOME GOOD REASON
AS LONG AS I STAYED THERE I FELT REASONABLY SAFE BECAUSE YOWLER WOULD HAVE TO FIND ME AND TO DO THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO CROSS AN OPEN PLACE WHERE I COULD SEE HIM I KNEW THAT IF I WENT ROAMING ABOUT I MIGHT WALK RIGHT INTO HIS CLUTCHES
THEY DESPATCH THEIR DINNERS QUICKLY BUT SIT LONG AT SUPPER BECAUSE THEY GO TO WORK AFTER THE ONE AND ARE TO SLEEP AFTER THE OTHER DURING WHICH THEY THINK THE STOMACH CARRIES ON THE CONCOCTION MORE VIGOROUSLY
OUT OF THESE THEY CHOOSE THEIR AMBASSADORS THEIR PRIESTS THEIR TRANIBORS AND THE PRINCE HIMSELF ANCIENTLY CALLED THEIR BARZENES BUT IS CALLED OF LATE THEIR ADEMUS
AND THESE BIG BROAD FEET ENABLE HIM TO TRAVEL ABOUT ON THE SNOW WITHOUT BREAKING THROUGH HE CAN TRAVEL WITH EASE WHERE REDDY FOX NOT HALF HIS SIZE AND WEIGHT WOULD BREAK THROUGH AT EVERY STEP
I HAD A FEELING THAT YOWLER WASN'T FAR AWAY I HATE THAT CAT I HATE THE WAY HE HUNTS HE GOES SNEAKING ABOUT WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND OR ELSE HE LIES IN WAIT READY TO SPRING WITHOUT WARNING ON THE FIRST ONE WHO HAPPENS ALONG
IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THE NEEDFUL ARTS AMONG THEM ARE MANAGED WITH LESS LABOUR THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
THAT IT MAKES ME SHIVER JUST TO THINK OF IT I GUESS IF I HADN'T BEEN THINKING ABOUT HIM HE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT ME TELL US ALL ABOUT IT DEMANDED OLD MOTHER NATURE SEEING BLACK PUSSY OVER HERE YESTERDAY AND KNOWING THAT TO DAY'S LESSON WAS TO BE ABOUT YOWLER
IT IS THE FEAR OF WANT THAT MAKES ANY OF THE WHOLE RACE OF ANIMALS EITHER GREEDY OR RAVENOUS BUT BESIDES FEAR THERE IS IN MAN A PRIDE THAT MAKES HIM FANCY IT A PARTICULAR GLORY TO EXCEL OTHERS IN POMP AND EXCESS
YOWLER IS HIMSELF A LYNX THE BAY LYNX IN SOME PLACES HE IS CALLED SIMPLY WILD CAT IN OTHERS HE IS CALLED THE CATAMOUNT HE IS NOT SO FOND OF THE THICK FORESTS AS HE IS OF SWAMPS BRUSH GROWN HILLSIDES
THEY WERE YOWLER'S FOOTPRINTS AND THEY HADN'T BEEN MADE VERY LONG OF COURSE SEEING THOSE FOOTPRINTS MADE ME MORE NERVOUS THAN EVER AND EVERY TIME I SAW A LEAF MOVE I JUMPED INSIDE MY HEART FELT AS IF IT WERE UP IN MY THROAT MOST OF THE TIME
THE PRETTY LITTLE SPOTTED BABIES OF LIGHTFOOT THE DEER ARE VICTIMS WHENEVER HE CAN FIND THEM THE DARKER AND DEEPER THE GREEN FOREST THE BETTER TUFTY LIKES IT HE MAKES HIS DEN UNDER GREAT TANGLES OF FALLEN TREES OR SIMILAR PLACES
BUT THEY TAKE MORE CARE OF THEIR SICK THAN OF ANY OTHERS THESE ARE LODGED AND PROVIDED FOR IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS THEY HAVE BELONGING TO EVERY TOWN FOUR HOSPITALS THAT ARE BUILT WITHOUT THEIR WALLS AND ARE SO LARGE THAT THEY MAY PASS FOR LITTLE TOWNS
TUFTY'S WAYS ARE MUCH LIKE THOSE OF HIS COUSIN YOWLER SAVE THAT HE IS A DWELLER IN THE DEEP WOODS ANYTHING HE CAN CATCH IS FOOD FOR TUFTY BUT HIS PRINCIPAL FOOD IS THE NORTHERN HARE THE COLOR OF HIS COAT BLENDS WITH THE SHADOWS SO THAT HE SEEMS LIKE A LIVING SHADOW HIMSELF
BY THIS MEANS IF THEY HAD EVER SUCH A NUMBER OF SICK PERSONS THEY COULD LODGE THEM CONVENIENTLY AND AT SUCH A DISTANCE THAT SUCH OF THEM AS ARE SICK OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES MAY BE KEPT SO FAR FROM THE REST THAT THERE CAN BE NO DANGER OF CONTAGION
BECAUSE OFTEN A THRIFTLESS HEIR SUFFERS A HOUSE THAT HIS FATHER BUILT TO FALL INTO DECAY SO THAT HIS SUCCESSOR MUST AT A GREAT COST REPAIR THAT WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE KEPT UP WITH A SMALL CHARGE IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT THE SAME HOUSE WHICH ONE PERSON BUILT AT A VAST EXPENSE
BUT THEY DO NOT ENGROSS THE WHOLE DISCOURSE SO TO THEMSELVES DURING THEIR MEALS THAT THE YOUNGER MAY NOT PUT IN FOR A SHARE ON THE CONTRARY THEY ENGAGE THEM TO TALK THAT SO THEY MAY IN THAT FREE WAY OF CONVERSATION FIND OUT THE FORCE OF EVERY ONE'S SPIRIT AND OBSERVE HIS TEMPER
AS THEIR CITIES ARE COMPOSED OF FAMILIES SO THEIR FAMILIES ARE MADE UP OF THOSE THAT ARE NEARLY RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER THEIR WOMEN WHEN THEY GROW UP ARE MARRIED OUT BUT ALL THE MALES BOTH CHILDREN AND GRAND CHILDREN
FOR HE IS A SPLENDID CLIMBER YOWLER IS FOUND IN NEARLY ALL OF THE SWAMPY BRUSHY AND WOODED PARTS OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY EXCEPTING IN THE GREAT FORESTS OF THE FAR NORTH WHERE HIS COUSIN TUFTY THE LYNX LIVES
HIS BIG SOFT EYES WERE SHINING WITH EXCITEMENT YOU LOOK AS THOUGH YOU HAD HAD AN ADVENTURE JUMPER SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE I HAVE REPLIED JUMPER IT IS A WONDER I AM HERE AT ALL
SINCE THERE IS SUCH PLENTY OF EVERYTHING AMONG THEM AND THERE IS NO DANGER OF A MAN'S ASKING FOR MORE THAN HE NEEDS THEY HAVE NO INDUCEMENTS TO DO THIS SINCE THEY ARE SURE THEY SHALL ALWAYS BE SUPPLIED
YELLING THAT WAY IS ONE OF YOWLER'S TRICKS EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE HE DOES IT FOR THE SAME REASON HOOTY THE OWL HOOTS HE HOPES THAT IT WILL STARTLE SOME SLEEPER SO THAT THEY WILL MOVE IF THEY DO HIS KEEN EARS ARE SURE TO HEAR IT
ACCORDING TO THEIR INCLINATIONS BUT IF OTHERS THAT ARE NOT MADE FOR CONTEMPLATION CHOOSE RATHER TO EMPLOY THEMSELVES AT THAT TIME IN THEIR TRADES AS MANY OF THEM DO THEY ARE NOT HINDERED BUT ARE RATHER COMMENDED AS MEN THAT TAKE CARE TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY
FOR DOING ALL THAT IS EITHER NECESSARY PROFITABLE OR PLEASANT TO MANKIND ESPECIALLY WHILE PLEASURE IS KEPT WITHIN ITS DUE BOUNDS THIS APPEARS VERY PLAINLY IN UTOPIA FOR THERE IN A GREAT CITY AND IN ALL THE TERRITORY THAT LIES ROUND IT
I DIDN'T MOVE AND HE DIDN'T MOVE SAVE THAT FOOLISH LOOKING TAIL OF HIS I HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE TO STAY IN THAT CLUMP OF FERNS ALL DAY WHEN SUDDENLY YOWLER SPRANG LIKE A FLASH THERE WAS A LITTLE SQUEAK AND THEN I SAW YOWLER TROT AWAY WITH A MOUSE IN HIS MOUTH
WHICH IS FOR THE MOST PART READING IT IS ORDINARY TO HAVE PUBLIC LECTURES EVERY MORNING BEFORE DAYBREAK AT WHICH NONE ARE OBLIGED TO APPEAR BUT THOSE WHO ARE MARKED OUT FOR LITERATURE YET A GREAT MANY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN OF ALL RANKS GO TO HEAR LECTURES OF ONE SORT OR OTHER
AND PARTLY BY PRACTICE THEY BEING LED OUT OFTEN INTO THE FIELDS ABOUT THE TOWN WHERE THEY NOT ONLY SEE OTHERS AT WORK BUT ARE LIKEWISE EXERCISED IN IT THEMSELVES BESIDES AGRICULTURE WHICH IS SO COMMON TO THEM ALL EVERY MAN HAS SOME PECULIAR TRADE TO WHICH HE APPLIES HIMSELF
I GUESS HE MUST HAVE SEEN THAT MOUSE GO IN A HOLE AND KNEW THAT IF HE WAITED LONG ENOUGH IT WOULD COME OUT AGAIN AS SOON AS YOWLER DISAPPEARED I HURRIED OVER HERE THAT'S ALL THAT WAS A SPLENDID ACCOUNT OF YOWLER AND HIS WAY OF HUNTING SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE
HE HUNTS IN THE GREEN FOREST EXACTLY AS BLACK PUSSY FARMER BROWN'S CAT HUNTS MICE IN THE BARN OR BIRDS IN THE OLD ORCHARD IN THE SPRING YOWLER DESTROYS MANY EGGS AND YOUNG BIRDS NOT ONLY THOSE FOUND IN NESTS ON THE GROUND BUT ALSO THOSE IN NESTS IN TREES
SO THAT IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT FOR WANT OF OTHER WORK VAST NUMBERS ARE SENT OUT TO MEND THE HIGHWAYS BUT WHEN NO PUBLIC UNDERTAKING IS TO BE PERFORMED THE HOURS OF WORKING ARE LESSENED
FOR THOUGH ANY THAT WILL MAY EAT AT HOME YET NONE DOES IT WILLINGLY SINCE IT IS BOTH RIDICULOUS AND FOOLISH FOR ANY TO GIVE THEMSELVES THE TROUBLE TO MAKE READY AN ILL DINNER AT HOME WHEN THERE IS A MUCH MORE PLENTIFUL ONE MADE READY FOR HIM SO NEAR HAND
IS NOT UNPLEASANTLY REPRESENTED TOGETHER WITH THE SPECIAL OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE PARTICULAR VIRTUES AND VICES AS ALSO THE METHODS BY WHICH VICE EITHER OPENLY ASSAULTS OR SECRETLY UNDERMINES VIRTUE AND VIRTUE ON THE OTHER HAND RESISTS IT
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND GAVE SUCH A YELL THAT IT IS A WONDER I DIDN'T JUMP OUT OF MY SKIN IT FRIGHTENED ME SO THAT I COULDN'T HAVE MOVED IF I HAD WANTED TO WHICH WAS A LUCKY THING FOR ME THE INSTANT HE YELLED HE COCKED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LISTENED
A FELLOW NEVER KNOWS WHERE TO WATCH OUT FOR YOWLER I SPENT NEARLY ALL NIGHT SITTING UNDER A LITTLE HEMLOCK TREE WITH BRANCHES VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND I SAT THERE BECAUSE I DIDN'T DARE DO ANYTHING ELSE
YOWLER'S FEET ARE LARGE BUT TUFTY'S ARE IMMENSE FOR HIS SIZE
THE SAME TRADE GENERALLY PASSES DOWN FROM FATHER TO SON INCLINATIONS OFTEN FOLLOWING DESCENT
AND ARE NOT ONLY VERY QUICK IN REPAIRING THEIR HOUSES BUT SHOW THEIR FORESIGHT IN PREVENTING THEIR DECAY
AND WHEN THAT IS TO BE DONE CARE IS TAKEN NOT ONLY BY HIS FATHER BUT BY THE MAGISTRATE THAT HE MAY BE PUT TO A DISCREET AND GOOD MAN AND IF AFTER A PERSON HAS LEARNED ONE TRADE HE DESIRES TO ACQUIRE ANOTHER THAT IS ALSO ALLOWED AND IS MANAGED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE FORMER
THEN THEY DRAW OUT A NUMBER OF THEIR CITIZENS OUT OF THE SEVERAL TOWNS AND SEND THEM OVER TO THE NEIGHBOURING CONTINENT WHERE IF THEY FIND THAT THE INHABITANTS HAVE MORE SOIL THAN THEY CAN WELL CULTIVATE THEY FIX A COLONY TAKING THE INHABITANTS INTO THEIR SOCIETY IF THEY ARE WILLING TO LIVE WITH THEM
BUT WORK THAT BY THEIR EXAMPLES THEY MAY EXCITE THE INDUSTRY OF THE REST OF THE PEOPLE THE LIKE EXEMPTION IS ALLOWED TO THOSE WHO BEING RECOMMENDED TO THE PEOPLE BY THE PRIESTS ARE BY THE SECRET SUFFRAGES OF THE SYPHOGRANTS PRIVILEGED FROM LABOUR
AFTER THE STEWARD OF THE HOSPITALS HAS TAKEN FOR THE SICK WHATSOEVER THE PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBES THEN THE BEST THINGS THAT ARE LEFT IN THE MARKET ARE DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY AMONG THE HALLS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR NUMBERS
PROVISION IS MADE THAT NONE OF THEIR CITIES MAY CONTAIN ABOVE SIX THOUSAND FAMILIES BESIDES THOSE OF THE COUNTRY AROUND IT NO FAMILY MAY HAVE LESS THAN TEN AND MORE THAN SIXTEEN PERSONS IN IT BUT THERE CAN BE NO DETERMINED NUMBER FOR THE CHILDREN UNDER AGE
EITHER NECESSARY OR CONVENIENT THAT IT IS RATHER TOO MUCH AND THIS YOU WILL EASILY APPREHEND IF YOU CONSIDER HOW GREAT A PART OF ALL OTHER NATIONS IS QUITE IDLE FIRST WOMEN GENERALLY DO LITTLE WHO ARE THE HALF OF MANKIND AND IF SOME FEW WOMEN ARE DILIGENT THEIR HUSBANDS ARE IDLE
THOUGH IT MIGHT BE OTHERWISE TOO NARROW AND BARREN FOR ANY ONE OF THEM BUT IF THE NATIVES REFUSE TO CONFORM THEMSELVES TO THEIR LAWS THEY DRIVE THEM OUT OF THOSE BOUNDS WHICH THEY MARK OUT FOR THEMSELVES AND USE FORCE IF THEY RESIST
BUT BY THE LAWS OF THE UTOPIANS THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THIS NEAR THESE MARKETS THERE ARE OTHERS FOR ALL SORTS OF PROVISIONS WHERE THERE ARE NOT ONLY HERBS FRUITS AND BREAD BUT ALSO FISH FOWL AND CATTLE
THE MORE I DID THINK ABOUT HIM AND THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM THE MORE NERVOUS I GOT THEN JUST BEFORE DARK ON THE BANK OF THE LAUGHING BROOK I FOUND SOME TRACKS IN THE MUD THOSE TRACKS WERE ALMOST ROUND AND THAT FACT WAS ENOUGH TO TELL ME WHO HAD MADE THEM
THAT YELL MUST HAVE WAKENED SOMEBODY AND CAUSED THEM TO MOVE FOR YOWLER TURNED SUDDENLY AND CREPT SWIFTLY AND WITHOUT A SOUND OUT OF SIGHT A MINUTE LATER I HEARD A JUMP AND THEN I HEARD A FLUTTERING I THINK HE CAUGHT ONE OF THE GROUSE FAMILY
AND OF THOSE THAT ARE CALLED RELIGIOUS MEN ADD TO THESE ALL RICH MEN CHIEFLY THOSE THAT HAVE ESTATES IN LAND WHO ARE CALLED NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN TOGETHER WITH THEIR FAMILIES MADE UP OF IDLE PERSONS THAT ARE KEPT MORE FOR SHOW THAN USE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST TABLE WHICH STANDS ACROSS THE UPPER END OF THE HALL SIT THE SYPHOGRANT AND HIS WIFE FOR THAT IS THE CHIEF AND MOST CONSPICUOUS PLACE NEXT TO HIM SIT TWO OF THE MOST ANCIENT FOR THERE GO ALWAYS FOUR TO A MESS
SUCH AS THE MANUFACTURE OF WOOL OR FLAX MASONRY SMITH'S WORK OR CARPENTER'S WORK FOR THERE IS NO SORT OF TRADE THAT IS IN GREAT ESTEEM AMONG THEM THROUGHOUT THE ISLAND THEY WEAR THE SAME SORT OF CLOTHES
AMONG THOSE MINISTERS PERTH AS FILLING THE GREAT PLACE OF CHANCELLOR AS STANDING HIGH IN THE ROYAL FAVOUR AS AN APOSTATE FROM THE REFORMED FAITH AND AS THE MAN WHO HAD FIRST INTRODUCED THE THUMBSCREW INTO THE JURISPRUDENCE OF HIS COUNTRY
WILLIAM DOUBTLESS READ THESE WORDS WITH ONE OF THOSE BITTER AND CYNICAL SMILES WHICH GAVE HIS FACE ITS LEAST PLEASING EXPRESSION
HAD CARRIED NEWS WHICH STIRRED THE PASSIONS OF THE OPPRESSED SCOTS WHILE THE EVENT OF THE MILITARY OPERATIONS WAS STILL DOUBTFUL THERE WERE AT EDINBURGH RIOTS AND CLAMOURS WHICH BECAME MORE MENACING AFTER JAMES HAD RETREATED FROM SALISBURY
GREAT CROWDS ASSEMBLED AT FIRST BY NIGHT AND THEN BY BROAD DAYLIGHT POPES WERE PUBLICLY BURNED LOUD SHOUTS WERE RAISED FOR A FREE PARLIAMENT PLACARDS WERE STUCK UP SETTING PRICES ON THE HEADS OF THE MINISTERS OF THE CROWN
A PENSIONER ON THE BOUNTY OF FRANCE EVEN THIS WAS NOT THE WORST VISIONS OF AN INNUMERABLE CROWD COVERING TOWER HILL AND SHOUTING WITH SAVAGE JOY AT THE SIGHT OF THE APOSTATE OF A SCAFFOLD HUNG WITH BLACK
HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT ANY PROMISE INTO WORDS STRONGER THAN THOSE IN WHICH JAMES HAD REPEATEDLY DECLARED THAT HE WOULD STRICTLY RESPECT THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF THE ANGLICAN CLERGY IF LAW OR HONOUR COULD HAVE BOUND HIM
MUNSTER AND HILDESHEIM THE MAJORITY WAS ADVERSE TO FRANCE LEWIS SAW WITH INDIGNATION AND ALARM
THAT DISSENSION HAD BY HIS SKILFUL MANAGEMENT BEEN EASILY QUIETED BUT FROM THE DAY ON WHICH HE ENTERED SAINT JAMES'S PALACE IN TRIUMPH SUCH MANAGEMENT COULD NO LONGER BE PRACTISED HIS VICTORY
THERE WOULD STILL REMAIN ONE ARGUMENT SUFFICIENT TO DECIDE THE CONTROVERSY WHAT CONCEIVABLE MOTIVE HAD SUNDERLAND TO WISH FOR A REVOLUTION UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM HE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF DIGNITY AND PROSPERITY
SERVICES BEYOND ALL PRICE FOR HE HAD THE ROYAL EAR HE HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER THE JESUITICAL CABAL AND HE WAS BLINDLY TRUSTED BY THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR A CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION WAS NOT WANTING A CHANNEL
AND SECRET INTELLIGENCE WAS STILL TRANSMITTED FROM THE WITTOL TO THE ADULTERESS FROM THE ADULTERESS TO THE GALLANT
TO THE ENEMIES OF JAMES IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE FIRST DECISIVE ASSURANCES OF SUNDERLAND'S SUPPORT WERE CONVEYED ORALLY BY SIDNEY TO WILLIAM ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST IT IS CERTAIN THAT FROM THAT TIME TILL THE EXPEDITION WAS READY TO SAIL
THE GREAT DESIGN WHICH HE MEDITATED HE WITH EXQUISITE SKILL PRESENTED TO DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS IN DIFFERENT LIGHTS AND IT MUST BE ADDED THAT THOUGH THOSE LIGHTS WERE DIFFERENT NONE OF THEM WAS FALSE HE CALLED ON THE PRINCES OF NORTHERN GERMANY
SHE VEHEMENTLY PROTESTED THAT IT WAS A FORGERY HER HUSBAND WITH CHARACTERISTIC INGENUITY DEFENDED HIMSELF BY REPRESENTING THAT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY MAN TO BE SO BASE AS TO DO WHAT HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF DOING
OF BURNET READING THE PRAYER FOR THE DEPARTING AND OF KETCH LEANING ON THE AXE WITH WHICH RUSSELL AND MONMOUTH HAD BEEN MANGLED IN SO BUTCHERLY A FASHION BEGAN TO HAUNT THE UNHAPPY STATESMAN THERE WAS YET ONE WAY IN WHICH HE MIGHT ESCAPE
IN THE SUMMER OF THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE ARCHBISHOPRIC BECAME VACANT FURSTEMBURG WAS THE CANDIDATE OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON THE ENEMIES OF THAT HOUSE PROPOSED THE YOUNG PRINCE CLEMENT OF BAVARIA FURSTEMBURG WAS ALREADY A BISHOP
THE STRONG TERRORS OF DEATH WERE UPON HIM AT THIS TIME
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY SMALL FORCE WHICH UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE OF GORDON A GREAT ROMAN CATHOLIC LORD GARRISONED THE CASTLE OF EDINBURGH EVERY MAIL WHICH HAD GONE NORTHWARD DURING THE EVENTFUL MONTH OF NOVEMBER
IF WE NEGLECT MINUTE SUBDIVISIONS WE SHALL FIND THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE NATION AND OF THE CONVENTION WAS DIVIDED INTO FOUR BODIES THREE OF THESE BODIES CONSISTED OF TORIES THE WHIG PARTY FORMED THE FOURTH
BY INSULTING THE HOLY SEE THESE FAULTS HE COMMITTED AT A CONJUNCTURE AT WHICH NO FAULT COULD BE COMMITTED WITH IMPUNITY AND UNDER THE EYE OF AN OPPONENT SECOND IN VIGILANCE SAGACITY AND ENERGY TO NO STATESMAN WHOSE MEMORY HISTORY HAS PRESERVED
THE ANXIETY OF WILLIAM BECAME INTENSE FROM COMMON EYES HIS FEELINGS WERE CONCEALED BY THE ICY TRANQUILLITY OF HIS DEMEANOUR
WHAT CHANCE WAS THERE THAT IN A NEW ORDER OF THINGS A MAN SO DEEPLY IMPLICATED IN ILLEGAL AND UNPOPULAR ACTS A MEMBER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION A RENEGADE WHOM THE MULTITUDE IN PLACES OF GENERAL RESORT PURSUED WITH THE CRY OF POPISH DOG
THAT BELOVED CHURCH TOO FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD AFTER A PAINFUL STRUGGLE BROKEN THROUGH HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE THRONE WAS SHE REALLY IN SAFETY OR HAD HE RESCUED HER FROM ONE ENEMY ONLY THAT SHE MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO ANOTHER
IF HE SUCCEEDED IN HIS DESIGN HE WOULD USE THE POWER WHICH HE MUST THEN POSSESS AS HEAD OF THE PROTESTANT INTEREST TO PROTECT THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF ROME PERHAPS THE PASSIONS EXCITED BY THE TYRANNY OF JAMES MIGHT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EFFACE THE PENAL LAWS FROM THE STATUTE BOOK
AND IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT FORTUNES OF THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR WERE IN HIS TIME RARER THAN FORTUNES OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR NOW ARE
BROUGHT INTELLIGENCE WHICH DAMPED THE ARDOUR OF HIS ADHERENTS
ONE SECTION OF THIS GREAT PARTY A SECTION WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY STRONG AMONG DIVINES AND OF WHICH SHERLOCK WAS THE CHIEF ORGAN
WAS THE MOST DETESTED HIS NERVES WERE WEAK HIS SPIRIT ABJECT AND THE ONLY COURAGE WHICH HE POSSESSED WAS THAT EVIL COURAGE WHICH BRAVES INFAMY AND WHICH LOOKS STEADILY ON THE TORMENTS OF OTHERS
THE NATION HAD NOT WAITED FOR THE CALL TOWN AND COUNTRY WERE ALREADY UP IN ARMS FOR THE PRINCE OF ORANGE NITHISDALE AND CLYDESDALE WERE THE ONLY REGIONS IN WHICH THERE WAS THE LEAST CHANCE THAT THE ROMAN CATHOLICS WOULD MAKE HEAD
FOR WHAT SATISFACTORY GUARANTEE COULD HE GIVE HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO DRAW UP AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT IN LANGUAGE CLEARER THAN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ACTS OF PARLIAMENT WHICH REQUIRED THAT THE DEAN OF CHRIST CHURCH SHOULD BE A PROTESTANT
THENCE BY ORDER OF THE COUNCIL OVER WHICH HE HAD LATELY PRESIDED AND WHICH WAS FILLED WITH MEN WHO HAD BEEN PARTAKERS IN HIS GUILT HE WAS REMOVED TO STIRLING CASTLE IT WAS ON A SUNDAY DURING THE TIME OF PUBLIC WORSHIP THAT HE WAS CONVEYED UNDER A GUARD TO HIS PLACE OF CONFINEMENT
WILLIAM SAW WITH STERN DELIGHT HIS ADVERSARIES TOILING TO CLEAR AWAY OBSTACLE AFTER OBSTACLE FROM HIS PATH WHILE THEY RAISED AGAINST THEMSELVES THE ENMITY OF ALL SECTS HE LABOURED TO CONCILIATE ALL
THE POPISH PRIESTS INDEED WERE IN EXILE IN HIDING OR IN PRISON
BUT THOSE LAWS SHOULD BE MITIGATED BY A LENIENT ADMINISTRATION NO CLASS WOULD REALLY GAIN MORE BY THE PROPOSED EXPEDITION THAN THOSE PEACEABLE AND UNAMBITIOUS ROMAN CATHOLICS WHO MERELY WISHED TO FOLLOW THEIR CALLINGS AND TO WORSHIP THEIR MAKER WITHOUT MOLESTATION
WHILE WILLIAM EXERTED HIMSELF TO ENLIST ON HIS SIDE THE SYMPATHIES BOTH OF PROTESTANTS AND OF ROMAN CATHOLICS HE EXERTED HIMSELF WITH NOT LESS VIGOUR AND PRUDENCE TO PROVIDE THE MILITARY MEANS WHICH HIS UNDERTAKING REQUIRED
AND YET WITHOUT DESPOILING HIM OF HIS CROWN THIS DEVICE WAS A REGENCY THE MOST UNCOMPROMISING OF THOSE DIVINES WHO HAD INCULCATED THE DOCTRINE OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE
IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THIS ARMY THE GARRISONS WERE WITHDRAWN FROM THE STRONGHOLDS IN DUTCH BRABANT EVEN THE RENOWNED FORTRESS OF BERGOPZOOM WAS LEFT ALMOST DEFENCELESS FIELD PIECES
NO FACT IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT SUNDERLAND OPPOSED SOME OF THE MOST IMPRUDENT STEPS WHICH JAMES TOOK AND IN PARTICULAR THE PROSECUTION OF THE BISHOPS WHICH REALLY BROUGHT ON THE DECISIVE CRISIS BUT EVEN IF THIS FACT WERE NOT ESTABLISHED
SUCH WAS THE REASONING OF THE PRIMATE HAD MADE JAMES AS UNFIT TO RULE HIS DOMINIONS AS ANY CHILD IN SWADDLING CLOTHES
THE CHIEFS OF A HOUSE OF ALMOST REGAL DIGNITY APPEARED AT THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY THIRTY LORDS AND ABOUT EIGHTY GENTLEMEN OF NOTE WILLIAM DESIRED THEM TO CONSULT TOGETHER
IT WAS IN TRUTH AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE A MIDDLE WAY WHERE THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR A MIDDLE WAY TO EFFECT A COMPROMISE BETWEEN TWO THINGS WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF COMPROMISE RESISTANCE AND NONRESISTANCE
IN A LETTER WRITTEN WITH A CERTAIN ELEVATION OF LANGUAGE WHICH WAS THE SURE MARK THAT HE WAS GOING TO COMMIT A BASENESS DECLARED THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO PERFORM HIS DUTY TO HEAVEN AND TO HIS COUNTRY AND THAT HE PUT HIS HONOUR ABSOLUTELY INTO THE HANDS OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
HE DISGUISED HIMSELF AS WELL AS HE COULD
THE ONLY LOSERS WOULD BE THE TYRCONNELS THE DOVERS THE ALBEVILLES AND THE OTHER POLITICAL ADVENTURERS WHO IN RETURN FOR FLATTERY AND EVIL COUNSEL HAD OBTAINED FROM THEIR CREDULOUS MASTER GOVERNMENTS REGIMENTS AND EMBASSIES
BY RELIEVING THE NATION FROM THE STRONG DREAD OF POPISH TYRANNY HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF HALF HIS INFLUENCE OLD ANTIPATHIES WHICH HAD SLEPT WHEN BISHOPS WERE IN THE TOWER WHEN JESUITS WERE AT THE COUNCIL BOARD
A SKIFF COMMANDED BY AN OLD BUCCANEER OVERTOOK THE FLYING VESSEL AND BOARDED HER PERTH WAS DRAGGED OUT OF THE HOLD ON DECK IN WOMAN'S CLOTHES STRIPPED HUSTLED AND PLUNDERED BAYONETS WERE HELD TO HIS BREAST BEGGING FOR LIFE WITH UNMANLY CRIES
NOT A DAY PASSED ON WHICH HE WAS NOT SEEN SPURRING FROM HIS VILLA TO THE HAGUE HE WAS PERPETUALLY CLOSETED WITH HIS MOST DISTINGUISHED ADHERENTS TWENTY FOUR SHIPS OF WAR WERE FITTED OUT FOR SEA IN ADDITION TO THE ORDINARY FORCE WHICH THE COMMONWEALTH MAINTAINED
AS HIS OWN CONVERT ALL FINES ALL FORFEITURES WENT TO SUNDERLAND ON EVERY GRANT TOLL WAS PAID TO HIM
SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD HE BY THAT INEXPIABLE CRIME MADE HIMSELF AN OBJECT OF HATRED AND CONTEMPT TO THE WHOLE NATION
AND TO LET HIM KNOW IN WHAT WAY HE COULD BEST PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF THEIR COUNTRY HE THEN WITHDREW AND LEFT THEM TO DELIBERATE UNRESTRAINED BY HIS PRESENCE THEY REPAIRED TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND PUT HAMILTON INTO THE CHAIR
AND CONFIDED TO A REGENT NAMED BY THE ESTATES OF THE REALM IN THIS WAY SANCROFT GRAVELY MAINTAINED THE PEOPLE WOULD REMAIN TRUE TO THEIR ALLEGIANCE THE OATHS OF FEALTY WHICH THEY HAD SWORN TO THEIR KING WOULD BE STRICTLY FULFILLED
THE ANSWER WAS HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO MY LORD PRESIDENT ONE BOLD MAN VENTURED TO SAY THAT THE LORD PRESIDENT GOT ALL THE MONEY OF THE COURT WELL REPLIED HIS MAJESTY
AS PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL HE TOOK PRECEDENCE OF THE WHOLE TEMPORAL PEERAGE AS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE HE WAS THE MOST ACTIVE AND POWERFUL MEMBER OF THE CABINET
BUT IN THE WIDE INTERVAL WHICH SEPARATED THE BIGOTS WHO STILL CLUNG TO THE DOCTRINES OF FILMER FROM THE ENTHUSIASTS WHO STILL DREAMED THE DREAMS OF HARRINGTON THERE WAS ROOM FOR MANY SHADES OF OPINION
CONSISTED OF PERSONS IN WHOM LOVE OF HEREDITARY MONARCHY AND LOVE OF CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM WERE COMBINED THOUGH IN DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS AND WHO WERE EQUALLY OPPOSED TO THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE KINGLY OFFICE AND TO THE UNCONDITIONAL RESTORATION OF THE KING
SUNDERLAND THEY REPRESENTED AS THE CHIEF CONSPIRATOR HE HAD THEY AVERRED IN PURSUANCE OF HIS GREAT DESIGN INCITED HIS TOO CONFIDING MASTER TO DISPENSE WITH STATUTES TO CREATE AN ILLEGAL TRIBUNAL
THAT COURSE MUST THEREFORE BE TAKEN WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN WHEN HENRY THE SIXTH WAS AN INFANT AND AGAIN WHEN HE BECAME LETHARGIC JAMES COULD NOT BE KING IN EFFECT BUT HE MUST STILL CONTINUE TO BE KING IN SEMBLANCE
HAD NEVER MAINTAINED THAT SUCH OBEDIENCE WAS DUE TO A BABE OR TO A MADMAN IT WAS UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WHEN THE RIGHTFUL SOVEREIGN WAS INTELLECTUALLY INCAPABLE OF PERFORMING HIS OFFICE A DEPUTY MIGHT BE APPOINTED TO ACT IN HIS STEAD
THERE WAS AS IT CHANCED AN EXCELLENT PRETENCE FOR MAKING THIS ADDITION TO THE MARINE FOR SOME ALGERINE CORSAIRS HAD RECENTLY DARED TO SHOW THEMSELVES IN THE GERMAN OCEAN A CAMP WAS FORMED NEAR NIMEGUEN MANY THOUSANDS OF TROOPS WERE ASSEMBLED THERE
AND TRELAWNEY BISHOP OF BRISTOL HAD DURING THEIR RESIDENCE IN THE TOWER RECONSIDERED THE DOCTRINE OF NONRESISTANCE AND WERE READY TO WELCOME AN ARMED DELIVERER A BROTHER OF THE BISHOP OF BRISTOL COLONEL CHARLES TRELAWNEY
BEEN SO DEEPLY CONCERNED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN THE LATE RISING AGAINST THE KING THAT THEY COULD NOT FOR VERY SHAME TALK AT THAT MOMENT ABOUT THE SACRED DUTY OF OBEYING NERO
WRITS MUST STILL RUN IN HIS NAME HIS IMAGE AND SUPERSCRIPTION MUST STILL APPEAR ON THE COIN AND ON THE GREAT SEAL ACTS OF PARLIAMENT MUST STILL BE CALLED FROM THE YEARS OF HIS REIGN BUT THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE TAKEN FROM HIM
AND THAT ANY PERSON WHO SHOULD RESIST THE DEPUTY AND SHOULD PLEAD AS AN EXCUSE FOR DOING SO THE COMMAND OF A PRINCE WHO WAS IN THE CRADLE OR WHO WAS RAVING WOULD JUSTLY INCUR THE PENALTIES OF REBELLION STUPIDITY PERVERSENESS AND SUPERSTITION
TO RALLY ROUND HIM IN DEFENCE OF THE COMMON CAUSE OF ALL REFORMED CHURCHES
THEY COULD NOT INDEED BE FORMALLY ENLISTED WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF THE FEDERATION BUT THEY WERE WELL DRILLED AND KEPT IN SUCH A STATE OF DISCIPLINE THAT THEY MIGHT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BE DISTRIBUTED INTO REGIMENTS WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THAT SANCTION SHOULD BE OBTAINED
HE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS WITH ALL SPEED AND WHEN THEY WERE COMPLETE TO SEIZE SOME FAVOURABLE MOMENT FOR REQUESTING THE CONSENT OF THE FEDERATION IT WAS OBSERVED BY THE AGENTS OF FRANCE THAT HE WAS MORE BUSY THAN THEY HAD EVER KNOWN HIM
THOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCOVER THE WHOLE TRUTH IT IS EASY TO DETECT SOME PALPABLE FICTIONS THE JACOBITES FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AFFIRMED THAT THE REVOLUTION OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WAS THE RESULT OF A PLOT CONCERTED LONG BEFORE
OF THE BRITISH ROMAN CATHOLICS WAS THAT SHORTSIGHTED AND HEADSTRONG MONARCH WHO WHEN HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE OBTAINED FOR THEM A LEGAL TOLERATION HAD TRAMPLED ON LAW LIBERTY PROPERTY IN ORDER TO RAISE THEM TO AN ODIOUS AND PRECARIOUS ASCENDENCY
AND BOTH NITHISDALE AND CLYDESDALE WERE SOON OCCUPIED BY BANDS OF ARMED PRESBYTERIANS AMONG THE INSURGENTS WERE SOME FIERCE AND MOODY MEN WHO HAD FORMERLY DISOWNED ARGYLE AND WHO WERE NOW EQUALLY EAGER TO DISOWN WILLIAM
AND SHOULD IN SPITE OF ALL THE FAULTS OF THE HEREDITARY MONARCH UPHOLD THE CAUSE OF HEREDITARY MONARCHY THE BODY WHICH WAS ANIMATED BY THESE SENTIMENTS WAS LARGE AND RESPECTABLE
TWO THIRDS OF THE CHAPTER OF COLOGNE SHOULD JOIN THE POPE WOULD GRANT NO DISPENSATION TO A CREATURE OF FRANCE THE EMPEROR INDUCED MORE THAN A THIRD PART OF THE CHAPTER TO VOTE FOR THE BAVARIAN PRINCE MEANWHILE
BUT THIS MOTION WAS ILL RECEIVED BY THE MOVER'S FATHER AND BY THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY AND DID NOT EVEN FIND A SECONDER AT LENGTH RESOLUTIONS WERE CARRIED CLOSELY RESEMBLING THE RESOLUTIONS WHICH THE ENGLISH LORDS AND COMMONERS HAD PRESENTED TO THE PRINCE A FEW DAYS BEFORE
OR FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS DOWN FROM IRELAND WHAT SUMS HE MADE BY SELLING PLACES TITLES AND PARDONS CAN ONLY BE CONJECTURED BUT MUST HAVE BEEN ENORMOUS JAMES SEEMED TO TAKE A PLEASURE IN LOADING WITH WEALTH ONE WHOM HE REGARDED
IF THE MISGOVERNMENT OF JAMES WERE SUFFERED TO CONTINUE IT MUST PRODUCE AT NO REMOTE TIME A POPULAR OUTBREAK WHICH MIGHT BE FOLLOWED BY A BARBAROUS PERSECUTION OF THE PAPISTS THE PRINCE DECLARED THAT TO AVERT THE HORRORS OF SUCH A PERSECUTION WAS ONE OF HIS CHIEF OBJECTS
WITH ALL THAT FROM HIS YOUTH UP HE HAD MOST HATED WITH OLD PARLIAMENTARY CAPTAINS WHO HAD STORMED HIS COUNTRY HOUSE WITH OLD PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERS WHO HAD SEQUESTRATED HIS ESTATE WITH MEN WHO HAD PLOTTED THE RYE HOUSE BUTCHERY AND HEADED THE WESTERN REBELLION
HE COULD NOT MAKE A DESCENT ON ENGLAND WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES IF HE ASKED FOR THAT SANCTION BEFORE HIS DESIGN WAS RIPE FOR EXECUTION HIS INTENTIONS MIGHT POSSIBLY BE THWARTED BY THE FACTION HOSTILE TO HIS HOUSE AND WOULD CERTAINLY BE DIVULGED TO THE WHOLE WORLD
WOULD BE GREATER AND RICHER WHAT CHANCE THAT HE WOULD EVEN BE ABLE TO ESCAPE CONDIGN PUNISHMENT HE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN LONG IN THE HABIT OF LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN WILLIAM AND MARY MIGHT BE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF NATURE AND LAW
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FLY FROM HIS KINGDOM IF NEITHER LAW NOR HONOUR COULD BIND HIM COULD HE SAFELY BE PERMITTED TO RETURN IT IS PROBABLE HOWEVER THAT IN SPITE OF THESE ARGUMENTS A MOTION FOR OPENING A NEGOTIATION WITH JAMES
THAT EVERY FENCE WHICH EXCLUDED THEM FROM ECCLESIASTICAL PREFERMENT WOULD SOON BE LEVELLED THAT THE ARTICLES WOULD BE SOFTENED DOWN THAT THE LITURGY WOULD BE GARBLED THAT CHRISTMAS WOULD CEASE TO BE A FEAST THAT GOOD FRIDAY WOULD CEASE TO BE A FAST
TO CONFISCATE FREEHOLD PROPERTY AND TO SEND THE FATHERS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH TO A PRISON THIS ROMANCE RESTS ON NO EVIDENCE AND THOUGH IT HAS BEEN REPEATED DOWN TO OUR OWN TIME SEEMS HARDLY TO DESERVE CONFUTATION
HE WILDLY TRIED TO FIND CONSOLATION IN THE RITES OF HIS NEW CHURCH HE IMPORTUNED HIS PRIESTS FOR COMFORT PRAYED CONFESSED AND COMMUNICATED BUT HIS FAITH WAS WEAK AND HE OWNED THAT IN SPITE OF ALL HIS DEVOTIONS
AND MANY OTHERS NOW HASTENED THITHER TO PAY THEIR COURT TO HIM ON THE SEVENTH OF JANUARY HE REQUESTED THEM TO ATTEND HIM AT WHITEHALL THE ASSEMBLAGE WAS LARGE AND RESPECTABLE THE DUKE OF HAMILTON AND HIS ELDEST SON THE EARL OF ARRAN
TO FILL THE CHURCH WITH POPISH DIGNITARIES AND TO PLACE THE ARMY UNDER THE COMMAND OF POPISH OFFICERS BUT IF AS THE TORIES THEMSELVES NOW SEEMED TO CONFESS THAT THEORY WAS UNSOUND WHY TREAT WITH THE KING
THE PREPARATIONS WERE NOT QUITE COMPLETE THE DESIGN WAS ALREADY SUSPECTED
BUT EVEN RIGID PURITANS FORGOT THE SANCTITY OF THE DAY AND OF THE WORK THE CHURCHES POURED FORTH THEIR CONGREGATIONS AS THE TORTURER PASSED BY AND THE NOISE OF THREATS EXECRATIONS AND SCREAMS OF HATRED
EVEN IF THIS IS LADY SUNDERLAND'S HAND HE SAID THAT IS NO AFFAIR OF MINE YOUR MAJESTY KNOWS MY DOMESTIC MISFORTUNES THE FOOTING ON WHICH MY WIFE AND MISTER SIDNEY ARE IS BUT TOO PUBLIC WHO CAN BELIEVE THAT I WOULD MAKE A CONFIDANT OF THE MAN
GREAT QUANTITIES OF GOLD NOT LESS IT WAS SAID THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND GUINEAS CAME TO HIM FROM ENGLAND
THAT CANONS ON WHOM NO BISHOP HAD EVER LAID HIS HAND WOULD WITHOUT THE SACRED VESTMENT OF WHITE LINEN DISTRIBUTE IN THE CHOIRS OF CATHEDRALS THE EUCHARISTIC BREAD AND WINE TO COMMUNICANTS LOLLING ON BENCHES THE PRINCE INDEED
WHO HAS INJURED MY HONOUR IN THE TENDEREST POINT
AND CHANGED SIDES WITH A PROMPTITUDE THEN COMMON AMONG SCOTTISH POLITICIANS THE PRIVY COUNCIL BY ONE PROCLAMATION ORDERED THAT ALL PAPISTS SHOULD BE DISARMED AND BY ANOTHER INVITED PROTESTANTS TO MUSTER FOR THE DEFENCE OF PURE RELIGION
THE KING OF FRANCE OR THE CITY OF AMSTERDAM MIGHT STILL FRUSTRATE THE WHOLE PLAN IF LEWIS WERE TO SEND A GREAT FORCE INTO BRABANT
THE TORIES HAD FORMERLY TAKEN THEIR STAND ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NONRESISTANCE BUT THAT GROUND MOST OF THEM HAD NOW ABANDONED AND WERE NOT DISPOSED AGAIN TO OCCUPY THE CAVALIERS OF ENGLAND HAD AS A CLASS
THE AMITY OF THE WHIGS AND TORIES HAD NOT SURVIVED THE PERIL WHICH HAD PRODUCED IT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS DURING THE PRINCE'S MARCH FROM THE WEST DISSENSION HAD APPEARED AMONG HIS FOLLOWERS
WAS A VERY SMALL PART OF WHAT HE RECEIVED FROM FRANCE ALONE HE DREW A REGULAR STIPEND OF NEAR SIX THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR BESIDES LARGE OCCASIONAL GRATUITIES HE HAD BARGAINED WITH TYRCONNEL FOR FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR
HIS HIGHNESS THEY SAID WAS PLAINLY A MALIGNANT THERE WAS NOT A WORD ABOUT THE COVENANT IN HIS DECLARATION THE DUTCH WERE A PEOPLE WITH WHOM NO TRUE SERVANT OF THE LORD WOULD UNITE THEY CONSORTED WITH LUTHERANS
THESE PREPARATIONS REQUIRED READY MONEY BUT WILLIAM HAD BY STRICT ECONOMY LAID UP AGAINST A GREAT EMERGENCY A TREASURE AMOUNTING TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING WHAT MORE WAS WANTING WAS SUPPLIED BY THE ZEAL OF HIS PARTISANS
THE LOSS OF HIS PLACES HIS SALARIES HIS PENSIONS WAS THE LEAST THAT HE HAD TO DREAD HIS PATRIMONIAL MANSION AMID WOODS AT ALTHORPE MIGHT BE CONFISCATED HE MIGHT LIE MANY YEARS IN A PRISON HE MIGHT END HIS DAYS IN A FOREIGN LAND
BUT THE PRESBYTERIAN AND INDEPENDENT TEACHERS WENT IN LONG PROCESSION TO SALUTE THE CHIEF OF THE GOVERNMENT AND WERE AS GRACIOUSLY RECEIVED AS THE TRUE SUCCESSORS OF THE APOSTLES SOME SCHISMATICS AVOWED THE HOPE
THERE WAS A VERY SMALL FACTION WHICH WISHED TO RECALL JAMES WITHOUT STIPULATIONS THERE WAS ALSO A VERY SMALL FACTION WHICH WISHED TO SET UP A COMMONWEALTH AND TO ENTRUST THE ADMINISTRATION TO A COUNCIL OF STATE UNDER THE PRESIDENCY OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
WAS NOT A FANATICAL PRESBYTERIAN BUT HE WAS AT BEST A LATITUDINARIAN HE HAD NO SCRUPLE ABOUT COMMUNICATING IN THE ANGLICAN FORM BUT HE CARED NOT IN WHAT FORM OTHER PEOPLE COMMUNICATED HIS WIFE IT WAS TO BE FEARED HAD IMBIBED TOO MUCH OF HIS SPIRIT
BOMBS AND TUMBRELS FROM ALL THE MAGAZINES OF THE UNITED PROVINCES WERE COLLECTED AT THE HEAD QUARTERS ALL THE BAKERS OF ROTTERDAM TOILED DAY AND NIGHT TO MAKE BISCUIT ALL THE GUNMAKERS OF UTRECHT WERE FOUND TOO FEW TO EXECUTE THE ORDERS FOR PISTOLS AND MUSKETS
THE KING OUGHT TO BE IMMEDIATELY INVITED BACK AND PERMITTED IF SUCH WERE HIS PLEASURE TO PUT SEYMOUR AND DANBY THE BISHOP OF LONDON AND THE BISHOP OF BRISTOL TO DEATH FOR HIGH TREASON TO REESTABLISH THE ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION
WILLIAM FIRST RECEIVED ASSURANCES OF SUPPORT FROM A VERY DIFFERENT QUARTER THE HISTORY OF SUNDERLAND'S INTRIGUES IS COVERED WITH AN OBSCURITY WHICH IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT ANY INQUIRER WILL EVER SUCCEED IN PENETRATING BUT
A WAY MORE TERRIBLE TO A NOBLE SPIRIT THAN A PRISON OR A SCAFFOLD HE MIGHT STILL BY A WELL TIMED AND USEFUL TREASON EARN HIS PARDON FROM THE FOES OF THE GOVERNMENT IT WAS IN HIS POWER TO RENDER TO THEM AT THIS CONJUNCTURE
WHO COMMANDED ONE OF THE TANGIER REGIMENTS NOW KNOWN AS THE FOURTH OF THE LINE SIGNIFIED HIS READINESS TO DRAW HIS SWORD FOR THE PROTESTANT RELIGION SIMILAR ASSURANCES ARRIVED FROM THE SAVAGE KIRKE CHURCHILL
IT INCLUDED ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS A MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN AND AT LEAST NINE TENTHS OF THE CLERGY BUT IT WAS TORN BY DISSENSIONS AND BESET ON EVERY SIDE BY DIFFICULTIES
HIS POST AT SUCH A TIME WAS AT THE HEAD OF THE COUNCIL BOARD BUT HIS HEART FAILED HIM AND HE DETERMINED TO TAKE REFUGE AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT FROM THE DANGER WHICH AS HE JUDGED BY THE LOOKS AND CRIES OF THE FIERCE AND RESOLUTE POPULACE OF EDINBURGH WAS NOT REMOTE
WAS STORMED AND SACKED HUGE HEAPS OF POPISH BOOKS BEADS CRUCIFIXES AND PICTURES WERE BURNED IN THE HIGH STREET IN THE MIDST OF THE AGITATION CAME DOWN THE TIDINGS OF THE KING'S FLIGHT THE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT GAVE UP ALL THOUGHT OF CONTENDING WITH THE POPULAR FURY
BUT HOSTILE TO HIM IN A PAPER WRITTEN WITH GREAT ACRIMONY HE COMPLAINED OF THE INJUSTICE WITH WHICH FRANCE WAS ON ALL OCCASIONS TREATED BY THAT SEE WHICH OUGHT TO EXTEND A PARENTAL PROTECTION
A STRONG GUARD ESCORTED HIM SAFE TO CASTLE DRUMMOND BUT SCARCELY HAD HE DEPARTED WHEN THE CITY ROSE UP A FEW TROOPS TRIED TO SUPPRESS THE INSURRECTION BUT WERE OVERPOWERED THE PALACE OF HOLYROOD WHICH HAD BEEN TURNED INTO A ROMAN CATHOLIC SEMINARY AND PRINTING HOUSE
HE SUCCEEDED IN EMBARKING BUT IN SPITE OF ALL HIS PRECAUTIONS HE HAD BEEN RECOGNISED AND THE ALARM HAD BEEN GIVEN AS SOON AS IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE CRUEL RENEGADE WAS ON THE WATERS AND THAT HE HAD GOLD WITH HIM PURSUERS INFLAMED AT ONCE BY HATRED AND BY AVARICE WERE ON HIS TRACK
WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE CONVENTION AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE GREAT BODY OF TORIES HAD HE NOT BEEN ON THIS AS ON EVERY OTHER OCCASION HIS OWN WORST ENEMY
IT WAS NOT OVER ENGLAND ALONE THAT WILLIAM'S GUARDIANSHIP NOW EXTENDED SCOTLAND HAD RISEN ON HER TYRANTS ALL THE REGULAR SOLDIERS BY WHOM SHE HAD LONG BEEN HELD DOWN HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY JAMES TO HIS HELP AGAINST THE DUTCH INVADERS
GOD SUPPORT YOU WILLIAM WROTE AND ENABLE YOU TO BEAR YOUR PART IN A WORK ON WHICH AS FAR AS HUMAN BEINGS CAN SEE
THOUGH THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN LITTLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THEIR DEBATES LASTED THREE DAYS A FACT WHICH IS SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SIR PATRICK HUME WAS ONE OF THE DEBATERS ARRAN VENTURED TO RECOMMEND A NEGOTIATION WITH THE KING
LEFT VAGUE PERPLEXING MEMORIES STRANGE CREATURES STRANGE SCENERY AS IF FROM ANOTHER PLANET THERE WAS A DISTINCT IMPRESSION TOO OF A MOMENTOUS CONVERSATION OF A NAME
THE SELF WHO CAN TRACE ITS REINTEGRATION AS MORNING AFTER MORNING WE AWAKEN THE FLUX AND CONFLUENCE OF ITS COUNTLESS FACTORS INTERWEAVING REBUILDING THE DIM FIRST STIRRINGS OF THE SOUL
WERE THREE FIGURES RICHLY DRESSED IN LOOSE AND EASY GARMENTS OF BRIGHT SOFT COLOURINGS THE NOISE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE POURED UP OVER THE BALCONY AND ONCE IT SEEMED
WHEN THE LITTLE POSSUMS CRAWLED OUT WHERE THE BRANCHES WERE SMALL THEY SIMPLY WRAPPED THEIR TAILS AROUND THE TWIGS TO KEEP FROM FALLING MY EXCLAIMED PETER
I'M GLAD YOU DID REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE YOU SEE THE REST OF YOUR FRIENDS HERE ARE A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT THE POSSUM FAMILY MEANWHILE OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS CLIMBING A TREE
WERE VAST AND VAGUE ARCHITECTURAL FORMS THE TUMULT OF VOICES ROSE NOW LOUD AND CLEAR AND ON THE BALCONY AND WITH THEIR BACKS TO HIM GESTICULATING AND APPARENTLY IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION
THE APARTMENT LOST NONE OF ITS SIZE AND MAGNIFICENCE NOW THAT THE GREENISH TRANSPARENCY THAT HAD INTERVENED WAS REMOVED THE ARCHWAY HE SAW LED TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS GOING DOWNWARD WITHOUT THE INTERMEDIATION OF A DOOR
IT IS A WONDER THAT BETWEEN YOU AND CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL ANY OF THE BIRDS SUCCEED IN RAISING FAMILIES AROUND HERE HAVE YOU VISITED FARMER BROWN'S HEN HOUSE LATELY UNC BILLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
THEN WITH A SHOCK HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS NAKED AND CASTING ABOUT HIM FOR COVERING SAW A LONG BLACK ROBE THROWN ON ONE OF THE CHAIRS BESIDE HIM THIS HE WRAPPED ABOUT HIM AND SAT DOWN AGAIN TREMBLING
AND STAGGERED AND PUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE GLASS LIKE PANE BEFORE HIM TO STEADY HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT IT RESISTED HIS HAND BENDING OUTWARD LIKE A DISTENDED BLADDER THEN IT BROKE WITH A SLIGHT REPORT
AND A COUPLE WERE IN THE BIG POCKET WHERE THEY HAD SPENT THEIR BABYHOOD WE ALL DONE THOUGHT WE'D COME TO SCHOOL EXPLAINED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN
AND AS HE LOOKED A STEADY SWEEPING SHADOW BLOTTED IT OUT AND PASSED AND CAME AGAIN AND PASSED BEAT BEAT THAT SWEEPING SHADOW HAD A NOTE OF ITS OWN IN THE SUBDUED TUMULT THAT FILLED THE AIR
UNC POKED HIS HEAD A LITTLE FARTHER OUT AND PUT HIS HAND BEHIND HIS EAR AS IF HE WERE A LITTLE HARD OF HEARING
BUT HIS MIND WAS QUITE CLEAR EVIDENTLY HIS SLEEP HAD BENEFITED HIM HE WAS NOT IN A BED AT ALL AS HE UNDERSTOOD THE WORD BUT LYING NAKED ON A VERY SOFT AND YIELDING MATTRESS
THAT IT SEEMED TO PASS INTO HIS SKIN ABOVE AND BELOW AND THIS BED WAS PLACED IN A CASE OF GREENISH COLOURED GLASS AS IT SEEMED TO HIM A BAR IN THE WHITE FRAMEWORK OF WHICH HAD FIRST ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION
THE GROWTH AND SYNTHESIS OF THE UNCONSCIOUS TO THE SUBCONSCIOUS THE SUBCONSCIOUS TO DAWNING CONSCIOUSNESS UNTIL AT LAST WE RECOGNISE OURSELVES AGAIN AND AS IT HAPPENS TO MOST OF US AFTER THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
KNOW CRIED PETER I SAW HIM DO IT ONCE FARMER BROWN'S BOY SURPRISED UNC BILLY AND UNC BILLY JUST FELL RIGHT OVER DEAD POOH THAT'S A STORY PETER RABBIT
IT WENT UP BEYOND THE TOP OF HIS EYES HE TRIED TO THINK WHERE HE MIGHT BE DID IT MATTER SEEING HE WAS SO WRETCHED
THE PILGRIMAGE TOWARDS A PERSONAL BEING SEEMED TO TRAVERSE VAST GULFS TO OCCUPY EPOCHS GIGANTIC DREAMS THAT WERE TERRIBLE REALITIES AT THE TIME
AGAIN UNC BILLY GRINNED AND THEN PULLED HIMSELF BACK TO THE OTHER BRANCH OLD MOTHER NATURE SHOOK HER HEAD REPROVINGLY UNC BILLY SAID SHE
THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN ORDER OF THEIR OWN EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE THEY BELONG TO THE ORDER OF MARSUPIALS WHICH MEANS POUCHED ANIMALS
AND AFTER A PERIOD OF HESITATION SCRAMBLED OFF THE TRANSLUCENT MATTRESS AND TRIED TO STAND ON THE CLEAN WHITE FLOOR OF HIS LITTLE APARTMENT HE HAD MISCALCULATED HIS STRENGTH HOWEVER
AND ENDED REMOTELY IN A RAILED SPACE LIKE A BALCONY BRIGHTLY LIT AND PROJECTING INTO A SPACE OF HAZE A SPACE LIKE THE INTERIOR OF SOME GIGANTIC BUILDING BEYOND AND REMOTE
AND TOUCHED SOME SMOOTH HARD SURFACE LIKE GLASS THIS WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT STARTLED HIM EXTREMELY QUITE SUDDENLY HE ROLLED OVER STARED FOR A MOMENT AND STRUGGLED INTO A SITTING POSITION
THERE WAS A REITERATION OF WAKE HE HEARD SOME INDISTINCT SHRILL CRY AND ABRUPTLY THESE THREE MEN BEGAN LAUGHING HA HA HA LAUGHED ONE
AND VANISHED A PRICKED BUBBLE HE REELED OUT INTO THE GENERAL SPACE OF THE HALL GREATLY ASTONISHED HE CAUGHT AT THE TABLE TO SAVE HIMSELF KNOCKING ONE OF THE GLASSES TO THE FLOOR
HE REMEMBERED NOW THAT HE HAD WANTED TO SLEEP HE RECALLED THE CLIFF AND WATERFALL AGAIN AND THEN RECOLLECTED SOMETHING ABOUT TALKING TO A PASSER BY HOW LONG HAD HE SLEPT
THE EFFORT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY DIFFICULT AND IT LEFT HIM GIDDY AND WEAK AND AMAZED HE RUBBED HIS EYES THE RIDDLE OF HIS SURROUNDINGS WAS CONFUSING
TRIPPED ON THE CORNER OF THE BLACK CLOAK HE HAD WRAPPED ABOUT HIMSELF AND SAVED HIMSELF BY CATCHING AT ONE OF THE BLUE PILLARS THE PASSAGE RAN DOWN A COOL VISTA OF BLUE AND PURPLE
THE EFFORT OF A MAN NEAR DROWNING IN DARKNESS THEN CAME A PANORAMA OF DAZZLING UNSTABLE CONFLUENT SCENES GRAHAM BECAME AWARE THAT HIS EYES WERE OPEN
HIS MIND WAS STILL A SURGING PERPLEXITY CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT AND HAD BEEN REMOVED IN HIS SLEEP BUT WHERE AND WHO WERE THOSE PEOPLE THE DISTANT CROWD BEYOND THE DEEP BLUE PILLARS
AND IN THE WARMER PARTS OF THE MIDDLE WEST UNC BILLY AND HIS RELATIVES ARE NOT FOND OF COLD WEATHER THEY PREFER TO BE WHERE THEY CAN BE REASONABLY WARM ALL THE YEAR ROUND SOME FOLKS THINK UNC BILLY ISN'T SMART
A COUPLE OF GRACEFUL CHAIRS AND ON THE TABLE A NUMBER OF DISHES WITH SUBSTANCES PILED ON THEM A BOTTLE AND TWO GLASSES HE REALISED THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HUNGRY HE COULD SEE NO ONE
AND REGARDING SOME UNFAMILIAR THING IT WAS SOMETHING WHITE THE EDGE OF SOMETHING A FRAME OF WOOD HE MOVED HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF THIS SHAPE
WE UNS HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST YET SO WE UNS ARE FEELING PO'LY REPLIED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN A SUDDEN THOUGHT POPPED INTO PETER'S HEAD
SUPPOSE YOU CLIMB A TREE UNC BILLY AND SHOW YOUR FRIENDS HERE HOW YOU MANAGE TO GET THE EGGS FROM A NEST THAT YOU CANNOT REACH BY CRAWLING ALONG THE BRANCH ON WHICH IT IS PLACED SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE
CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR UNC BILLY AND OLD MISSUS POSSUM
IN A TROUGH OF DARK GLASS THE MATTRESS WAS PARTLY TRANSPARENT A FACT HE OBSERVED WITH A SENSE OF INSECURITY AND BELOW IT WAS A MIRROR REFLECTING HIM GREYLY
WITH A PLEASING FAINT AROMA AND TASTE AND A QUALITY OF IMMEDIATE SUPPORT AND STIMULUS HE PUT DOWN THE VESSEL AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
HE LOOKED A GREAT DEAL AS THOUGH HE MIGHT BE A GIANT RAT BUT IF UNC BILLY WAS A FUNNY LOOKING FELLOW OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS EVEN MORE FUNNY LOOKING
HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT NAME THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO RECUR OF SOME QUEER LONG FORGOTTEN SENSATION OF VEIN AND MUSCLE OF A FEELING OF VAST HOPELESS EFFORT
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU UNC BILLY DIDN'T SO MUCH AS WINK AN EYE FARMER BROWN'S BOY WENT OFF UP THE PATH CARRYING UNC BILLY BY THE TAIL BY AND BY HE LAID UNC BILLY DOWN
THE TOP OF A BANNER PASSED AND ONCE SOME BRIGHTLY COLOURED OBJECT A PALE BLUE CAP OR GARMENT THROWN UP INTO THE AIR PERHAPS FLASHED ATHWART THE SPACE AND FELL THE SHOUTS SOUNDED LIKE ENGLISH
AM I A WHAT HE DEMANDED
ABOUT HIS ARM AND HE SAW WITH A SHOCK THAT HIS SKIN WAS STRANGELY DRY AND YELLOW WAS BOUND A CURIOUS APPARATUS OF RUBBER BOUND SO CUNNINGLY
WHAT'S YO HURRY PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND LOOKED UP IN THAT TREE THERE PEERING DOWN AT HIM FROM A HOLE HIGH UP IN THE TRUNK WAS A SHARP WHITISH GRAY FACE
MISTER OPOSSUM BUT PETER WASN'T LISTENING THE FACT IS PETER HAD STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR SCHOOL WITHOUT EVEN BEING POLITE ENOUGH TO SAY GOOD BY HE ARRIVED AT SCHOOL QUITE OUT OF BREATH
AND WHEN SHE HAD REACHED A COMFORTABLE CROTCH THE LITTLE POSSUMS LEFT HER AND BEGAN TO PLAY ABOUT IN THE TREE IT WAS THEN THAT IT APPEARED WHAT HANDY THINGS THOSE NAKED LITTLE TAILS WERE
ON HIS WAY THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST HE PASSED A CERTAIN TREE HE WAS JUST PAST AND NO MORE WHEN A FAMILIAR VOICE HAILED HIM
ALL THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL PETER RABBIT DID HIS BEST TO THINK WHO IT COULD BE WHO ATE FLESH YET WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
IN THE CORNER OF THE CASE WAS A STAND OF GLITTERING AND DELICATELY MADE APPARATUS FOR THE MOST PART QUITE STRANGE APPLIANCES THOUGH A MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THERMOMETER WAS RECOGNISABLE
THE LIFE HAD BEEN SCARED RIGHT OUT OF UNC BILLY I GUESS FARMER BROWN'S BOY THOUGHT SO TOO HE PICKED UNC BILLY UP BY THE TAIL AND LOOKED HIM ALL OVER AND SAID YOU POOR LITTLE THING
THERE WERE TWELVE YOUNGSTERS AND THEY WERE EXACTLY LIKE THEIR PARENTS ONLY SMALL THEY WERE CLINGING ALL OVER OL MISSUS POSSUM SOME WERE ON HER BACK SOME WERE CLINGING TO HER SIDES
AND WERE BLACK FOR THE LOWER HALF THE REST BEING WHITE HE HAD A LONG WHITISH TAIL WITHOUT ANY HAIR ON IT ALTOGETHER WITH HIS SHARP FACE AND NAKED TAIL
A RED HAIRED MAN IN A SHORT PURPLE ROBE WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES WHEN HE TURNED HIS EYES FULL OF MERRIMENT ALONG THE PASSAGE HIS FACE CHANGED THE WHOLE MAN CHANGED
BECAME RIGID THE OTHER TWO TURNED SWIFTLY AT HIS EXCLAMATION AND STOOD MOTIONLESS THEIR FACES ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF CONSTERNATION AN EXPRESSION THAT DEEPENED INTO AWE
ON AN OLD STUMP WHILE HE WENT TO LOOK AT A NEST OF BLACKY THE CROW WHEN HE CAME BACK UNC BILLY WASN'T THERE I NEVER DID SEE UNC BILLY HURRY AS HE DID THE MINUTE FARMER BROWN'S BOY'S BACK WAS TURNED
NOW HAVE I MADE IT QUITE CLEAR WHY ALTHOUGH THEY EAT FLESH UNC BILLY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE SAME BIG ORDER AS BUSTER BEAR AND THE OTHER FLESH EATERS EVERYBODY NODDED
SO IT WAS WITH GRAHAM AT THE END OF HIS VAST SLUMBER A DIM CLOUD OF SENSATION TAKING SHAPE A CLOUDY DREARINESS AND HE FOUND HIMSELF VAGUELY SOMEWHERE RECUMBENT FAINT BUT ALIVE
BOSCASTLE HE POURED OUT AND PARTIALLY DRANK ANOTHER GLASS OF THE COLOURLESS FLUID WHAT WAS THIS PLACE THIS PLACE THAT TO HIS SENSES SEEMED SUBTLY QUIVERING LIKE A THING ALIVE
WHAT WAS THAT SOUND OF PATTERING FEET AND THAT RISE AND FALL LIKE THE MURMUR OF BREAKERS ON PEBBLES HE PUT OUT A LANGUID HAND TO REACH HIS WATCH FROM THE CHAIR WHEREON IT WAS HIS HABIT TO PLACE IT
HE CAME TO LIFE AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD DROPPED DEAD VERY GOOD PETER SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE SOME OTHER SMART LITTLE PEOPLE TRY THAT TRICK SOMETIMES
TO A SPACIOUS TRANSVERSE PASSAGE THIS PASSAGE RAN BETWEEN POLISHED PILLARS OF SOME WHITE VEINED SUBSTANCE OF DEEP ULTRAMARINE AND ALONG IT CAME THE SOUND OF HUMAN MOVEMENTS
ON MY WAY HERE I SAW UNC BILLY AND IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD RIGHT AWAY THAT HE WAS ONE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT AND MUST BE THE ONE BUT IF HE EATS FLESH
THOSE CERTAINLY ARE HANDY TAILS HANDIEST TAILS EVER WAS DECLARED UNC BILLY
AND HE DID TOO HE WAS THE DEADEST LOOKING THING I EVER SAW I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD MYSELF I WAS WATCHING FROM A BRAMBLE TANGLE WHERE I WAS HIDING AND I CERTAINLY THOUGHT
AND VOICES AND A DEEP UNDEVIATING DRONING NOTE HE SAT NOW FULLY AWAKE LISTENING ALERTLY FORGETTING THE VIANDS IN HIS ATTENTION
STRETCHING DOWN FULL LENGTH HE COULD JUST REACH THE BRANCH BELOW HIM YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED IF THERE WAS A NEST ON THIS BRANCH DOWN HERE AH COULD GET THOSE EGGS WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
CRIED PETER RIGHT YOU ARE REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOWEVER DID YOU FIND IT OUT I DIDN'T EXACTLY FIND IT OUT I GUESSED IT REPLIED PETER
YET DOESN'T BELONG TO THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
WITH A PAIR OF TWINKLING BLACK EYES HELLO UNC BILLY CRIED PETER HOW ARE YOU AND OL MISSUS POSSUM PO'LY PETER PO'LY
THEY LOOK TOO FUNNY FOR ANYTHING THE OPOSSUMS ARE THE ONLY MARSUPIALS IN THIS COUNTRY CONTINUED OLD MOTHER NATURE
UNC BILLY GRINNED AND GOOD NATUREDLY STARTED UP A TREE HE CREPT OUT ON A BRANCH THAT OVERHUNG ANOTHER BRANCH WAY OUT WHERE THE BRANCH WAS SMALL CREPT UNC BILLY
HOW COULD UNC BILLY HAVE FALLEN OVER DEAD AND BE ALIVE UP IN THAT TREE THIS VERY MINUTE CRIED HAPPY JACK I DIDN'T MEAN HE WAS REALLY DEAD BUT THAT HE LOOKED AS IF HE WERE DEAD EXPLAINED PETER
BUT NONE OF THEM CAN DO IT AS WELL AS UNC BILLY POSSUM PRETENDING TO BE DEAD IN ORDER TO REMAIN ALIVE IS THE CLEVEREST THING UNC BILLY DOES
THE MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD INVOLVED A PERCEPTION OF EXTREME PHYSICAL WEAKNESS HE SUPPOSED HE WAS IN BED IN THE HOTEL AT THE PLACE IN THE VALLEY BUT HE COULD NOT RECALL THAT WHITE EDGE HE MUST HAVE SLEPT
AND FORGOTTEN TO BRUSH HIS HAIR IT POINTED EVERY WHICH WAY HIS LEGS WERE DARK HIS FEET BLACK AND HIS TOES WHITE HIS EARS WERE WITHOUT ANY HAIR AT ALL
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE
CAME THE POSSUM FAMILY AND A FUNNY LOOKING SIGHT THEY WERE UNC BILLY WAS WHITISH GRAY HIS FACE WHITER THAN THE REST OF HIM HE LOOKED AS IF HE HAD JUST GOTTEN OUT OF BED
SAID HE ARE POSSUMS FOUND ANYWHERE EXCEPT AROUND HERE INQUIRED HAPPY JACK YES INDEED REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE THEY ARE FOUND ALL DOWN THROUGH THE SUNNY SOUTH
BUT THOSE FOLKS DON'T KNOW UNC BILLY HE LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT HE CAN'T RUN AS FAST AS SOME OTHERS SO HE HAS LEARNED TO DEPEND ON HIS WITS IN TIME OF DANGER WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DOES I
THEN HE WRAPPED THE END OF HIS TAIL AROUND THE BRANCH AND SWUNG HIMSELF OFF KEEPING HOLD OF THE BRANCH ONLY WITH HIS TAIL AND ONE HIND FOOT THEN
AND WITH A VERY LARGE AND SIMPLE WHITE ARCHWAY FACING HIM CLOSE TO THE WALLS OF THE CAGE WERE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE A TABLE COVERED WITH A SILVERY CLOTH SILVERY LIKE THE SIDE OF A FISH
CHAPTER THREE THE AWAKENING BUT WARMING WAS WRONG IN THAT AN AWAKENING CAME WHAT A WONDERFULLY COMPLEX THING THIS SIMPLE SEEMING UNITY
SHE SEEMED TO HAVE HEADS AND TAILS ALL OVER HER YOU SEE SHE HAD BROUGHT ALONG HER FAMILY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM IS ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN LARGE FAMILIES
REPEATED PETER AH RECKONS AH MIGHT BE IF AH KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT AS LONG AS AH DON'T
IT IS BECAUSE THE MOTHERS HAVE BIG POCKETS IN WHICH THEY CARRY THEIR BABIES OLD MISSUS POSSUM HAS JUST SUCH A POCKET
I DON'T SEE WHY HE ISN'T A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS IT IS BECAUSE HE BELONGS TO A GROUP WHICH HAS SOMETHING WHICH MAKES THEM ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER ANIMALS AND FOR THIS REASON
JUST THEN CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL SHOUTED HERE COMES UNC BILLY OL MISSUS POSSUM AND ALL THE LITTLE POSSUMS SURE ENOUGH DOWN THE LONE LITTLE PATH
HE WOULD HAVE CALLED OUT BUT ONLY A LITTLE SOUND CAME INTO HIS THROAT THEN HE STOOD UP AND WITH THE UNCERTAIN STEPS OF A DRUNKARD MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY HE STAGGERED DOWN THE STEPS
THE SLIGHTLY GREENISH TINT OF THE GLASS LIKE SUBSTANCE WHICH SURROUNDED HIM ON EVERY HAND OBSCURED WHAT LAY BEHIND BUT HE PERCEIVED IT WAS A VAST APARTMENT OF SPLENDID APPEARANCE
HE FELT THE FEATURELESS MISERY OF ONE WHO WAKES TOWARDS THE HOUR OF DAWN HE HAD AN UNCERTAIN SENSE OF WHISPERS AND FOOTSTEPS HASTILY RECEDING
HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AT THE CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL FORM OF THE APARTMENT UNSTAINED BY ORNAMENT AND SAW THAT THE ROOF WAS BROKEN IN ONE PLACE BY A CIRCULAR SHAFT FULL OF LIGHT
WHERE IS YOUR HOME ASKED JOHNNY CHUCK I KNOW SAID PETER RABBIT IT'S UP IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE UNC BILLY LOOKED DOWN AT PETER
IT RANG BUT DID NOT BREAK AND SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE ARMCHAIRS WHEN HE HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED HE FILLED THE REMAINING GLASS FROM THE BOTTLE AND DRANK A COLOURLESS LIQUID IT WAS BUT NOT WATER
EVERY FEW HOPS HE WOULD STOP TO THINK BUT ALL HIS STOPPING AND ALL HIS THINKING WERE IN VAIN AND WHEN HE STARTED FOR SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS AS PUZZLED AS EVER
YOU ARE A BAD OLD RASCAL TO STEAL EGGS WHAT'S MORE
NOT LATELY SAID HE AH DONE GOT A DREADFUL SCARE THE LAST TIME AH WAS UP THERE
I HAVE SOMETIMES FANCIED I HAVE SOMETIMES WONDERED WHETHER I HAVE STILL TWO COMMENTS TO MAKE I HAVE TAKEN PAINS TO KNOW
I HOPE NOT TO OCCUPY MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES I HOPE THAT I SHALL NOT BE SO UNFORTUNATE I HOPE THE DAY MAY BE FAR DISTANT
AN AUDACIOUS CHALLENGE OF RIDICULE
I DO NOT SAY THIS WITH ANY AFFECTATION I DO NOT SEE HOW IT IS POSSIBLE I DO NOT SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN I DO NOT SEEK TO PALLIATE
I HAVE PLEASANT MEMORIES OF I HAVE POINTED OUT I HAVE PRIDE AND PLEASURE IN QUOTING I HAVE RACKED THIS BRAIN OF MINE
I DO NOT SPEAK EXCLUSIVELY I DO NOT STOP TO DISCUSS I DO NOT THEREFORE WONDER I DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO WARN YOU
LINGERED IN FANCY I HAVE ONE STEP FARTHER TO GO I HAVE ONLY PARTIALLY EXAMINED I HAVE PARTLY ANTICIPATED
I GIVE YOU IN CONCLUSION THIS SENTENCE I GO FURTHER I GRANT ALL THIS I GRANT WITH MY WARMEST ADMIRATION
ALL THE WORLD WAS FLOODED WITH A SOFT GOLDEN LIGHT ALL WAS A VAGUE JUMBLE OF CHAOTIC IMPRESSIONS ALL WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE
I HAVE A GREAT ADMIRATION FOR I HAVE A PLEASING AND PERSONAL DUTY I HAVE A PROFOUND PITY FOR THOSE I HAVE A RIGHT TO CONSIDER I HAVE A STRONG BELIEF
SO YOU OBSERVE THE TRANSFORMATION SOMETHING AMUSES YOU SOMETIMES THE ABSURDITY OF IT OCCURS TO ME
ANTICIPATION PAINTED THE WORLD IN ROSE APPALLED IN SPEECHLESS DISGUST APPEALING TO THE URGENT TEMPER OF YOUTH
I HAVE ANTICIPATED THE OBJECTION I HAVE ASSUMED THROUGHOUT I HAVE ATTEMPTED THUS HASTILY I HAVE BARELY TOUCHED SOME OF THE POINTS
I HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR INTRUDING I HAVE NO FEAR OF MYSELF I HAVE NO FEARS FOR THE SUCCESS I HAVE NO HESITATION IN ASSERTING
AN INTENSE TRAVAIL OF MIND AN OBSCURE THRILL OF ALARM AN ODD LITTLE AIR OF PENITENT SELF DEPRECIATION
ALL THE PLACE IS PEOPLED WITH SWEET AIRS ALL THE SKY WAS MOTHER OF PEARL AND TENDER ALL THE UNKNOWN OF THE NIGHT AND OF THE UNIVERSE WAS PRESSING UPON HIM
I FANCY I HEAR YOU SAY I FEAR I MAY SEEM TRIFLING I FEAR LEST I MAY I FEARLESSLY APPEAL
I FEARLESSLY CHALLENGE I FEEL A GREAT NECESSITY TO I FEEL BOUND TO ADD MY EXPRESSION I FEEL CONSTRAINED TO DECLARE
I HEAR IT SOMETIMES SAID I HEAR YOU SAY TO YOURSELVES I HEARTILY FEEL THE SINGULAR CLAIMS I HESITATE TO TAKE AN INSTANCE
I HAVE NO THOUGHT OF VENTURING TO SAY I HAVE NO WISH AT ALL TO PREACH I HAVE NOT ACCUSTOMED MYSELF I HAVE NOT ALLOWED MYSELF
ABSOLUTELY VULGARIZED BY TOO PERPETUAL A PARROTING ABSORBED IN A STREAM OF THOUGHTS AND REMINISCENCES ABSORBED IN THE SCENT AND MURMUR OF THE NIGHT
I FEEL TEMPTED TO INTRODUCE HERE I FEEL THAT I HAVE A SPECIAL RIGHT TO I FEEL THAT IT IS NOT TRUE I FEEL THE GREATEST SATISFACTION
ALIEN PATHS AND IRRELEVANT JUNKETINGS ALL EMBROWNED AND MOSSED WITH AGE ALL HER GIFT OF SERENE IMMOBILITY BROUGHT INTO PLAY
I HOPE THE TIME MAY COME AGAIN I HOPE TO BE EXCUSED IF I HOPE TO BE FORGIVEN IF
I HAVE NOT THE RIGHT TO REPROACH I HAVE NOT TIME TO PRESENT I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY I HAVE NOTICED OF LATE YEARS
SHOW ME THAT THE TWO CASES ARE ANALOGOUS SO FAR SO GOOD SO I INFERRED SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR ME
I DO NOT WONDER I DOUBT VERY MUCH WHETHER I DWELL WITH PLEASURE ON THE CONSIDERATIONS I EARNESTLY MAINTAIN
AN AIR OF INIMITABLE SCRUTINIZING SUPERB IMPERTINENCE AN AIR OF STERN DEEP AND IRREDEEMABLE GLOOM HUNG OVER AND PERVADED ALL
I DO NOT MEAN ANYTHING SO ABSURD I DO NOT MEAN NOW TO GO FURTHER THAN I DO NOT MEAN TO IMPUTE I DO NOT MERELY URGE
ALL WAS INSTINCTIVE AND SPONTANEOUS ALOOF FROM THE MOTLEY THRONG AMBITION SHIVERED INTO FRAGMENTS AMID DISTRESS AND HUMILIATION
AMID THE DIREFUL CALAMITIES OF THE TIME AN ACUTE NOTE OF DISTRESS IN HER VOICE AN AGREEABLY GRAVE VACUITY
QUIBBLING I CALL IT QUITE SO
I DO NOT DEEM IT INCUMBENT UPON ME I DO NOT DEPRECIATE FOR A MOMENT I DO NOT DESIRE TO CALL IN QUESTION I DO NOT DESIRE TO PUT TOO MUCH EMPHASIS
NO I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT NOT AT ALL NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE NOTHING COULD BE MORE DELIGHTFUL NOW IS IT VERY PLAIN TO YOU
REFLECT UPON THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES RELATIVELY SPEAKING RELUCTANTLY I ADMIT IT
AN IMPERSONAL AND SLIGHTLY IRONIC INTEREST AN IMPERVIOUS BECKONING MOTION
I HAVE LITTLE HOPE THAT I CAN ADD ANYTHING I HAVE LIVED TO SEE I HAVE LONG AGO INSISTED I HAVE LONG BEEN OF THE CONVICTION
PERHAPS YOU DO NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO DO SO PERHAPS YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL PERSONALLY I CONFESS TO AN OBJECTION
PRAY DON'T APOLOGIZE PRAY FORGIVE ME FOR INTRUDING ON YOU SO UNCEREMONIOUSLY PRAY GO ON PRECISELY THAT IS JUST WHAT I MEANT
AFFECTED AN IRONIC INCREDULITY AFFECTING A TONE OF GAYETY AFTER A FIRST MOMENT OF RELUCTANCE AFTER AN ETERNITY OF RESOLUTIONS DOUBTS AND INDECISIONS
I FEEL THE TASK IS FAR BEYOND MY POWER I FERVENTLY TRUST I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UTTER IN WORDS I FIND IT MORE EASY
PLEASE CONTINUE TO BE FRANK PLEASE DO NOT THINK I AM ASKING OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY PLEASE FORGIVE MY THOUGHTLESSNESS PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME
HOW KIND AND GOOD YOU ARE MAY I ASK TO WHOM YOU ALLUDE MAY I BE PRIVILEGED TO HEAR IT MAY I SPEAK FREELY
SPEAKING WITH ALL DUE RESPECT STILL YOU MIGHT MAKE AN EXCEPTION STRANGELY IT'S TRUE SUCH CONDUCT SEEMS TO ME UNJUSTIFIABLE
I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO EMPHASIZE I HAVE ENLARGED ON THIS SUBJECT I HAVE FELT IT ALMOST A DUTY TO
I HAVE NOW EXPLAINED TO YOU I HAVE NOW MADE BOLD TO TOUCH UPON I HAVE NOW RATHER MORE THAN KEPT MY WORD
I HOLD THIS TO BE A TRUTH I HOLD TO THE PRINCIPLE I HOPE BY THIS TIME WE ARE ALL CONVINCED I HOPE FOR OUR OWN SAKES
I HAVE SAID WHAT I SOLEMNLY BELIEVE I HAVE SCANT PATIENCE I HAVE SEEN FOR MYSELF I HAVE SEEN IT STATED IN A RECENT JOURNAL
I GRATEFULLY ACCEPT I GREATLY DEPLORE I HAD A KIND OF HOPE I HAD ALMOST SAID I HAD IN COMMON WITH OTHERS
I HAVE THOUGHT IT INCUMBENT ON ME I HAVE THOUGHT IT RIGHT ON THIS DAY I HAVE THOUGHT IT WELL TO SUGGEST
LET ME SAY HOW DEEPLY INDEBTED I FEEL FOR YOUR KINDNESS LET ME SPEAK FRANKLY
I HAVE TRIED TO CONVEY TO YOU I HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO SPEAK I HAVE VERY MUCH LESS FEELING OF I HAVE WATCHED WITH SOME ATTENTION
MY INFORMATION IS RATHER SCANTY MY MEANING IS QUITE THE CONTRARY MY POINT OF VIEW IS DIFFERENT BUT I SHALL NOT INSIST UPON IT
OF COURSE BUT THAT AGAIN ISN'T THE POINT OF COURSE I AM DELIGHTED OF COURSE I DON'T WANT TO PRESS YOU AGAINST YOUR WILL OF COURSE
ALL HOPE OF DISCREET RETICENCE WAS RIPPED TO SHREDS ALL THE LESSER LIGHTS PALED INTO INSIGNIFICANCE ALL THE MAGIC OF YOUTH AND JOY OF LIFE WAS THERE
I DO NOT FEAR A CONTRADICTION I DO NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY I DO NOT FORGET THE PRACTICAL NECESSITY I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY
I FEEL ENTIRELY SATISFIED I FEEL I HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY I FEEL IT A PROUD PRIVILEGE I FEEL KEENLY MYSELF IMPELLED BY EVERY DUTY
I DO NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE I DO NOT THINK IT UNFAIR REASONING I DO NOT THINK MYSELF OBLIGED TO DWELL I DO NOT THINK THAT I NEED FURTHER DISCUSS
I HAVE A VERY HIGH RESPECT FOR I HAVE ABSTAINED FROM I HAVE ACQUIRED SOME USEFUL EXPERIENCE I HAVE ALL ALONG IMPLIED
I HAVE BEEN TOO LONG ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR I HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY THE LARGE GENEROSITY I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SHOW
AN ICINESS A SINKING A SICKENING OF THE HEART AN IGNORING EYE AN IMPENETRABLE SCREEN OF FOLIAGE
AN UTTER DEPRESSION OF SOUL AND DAY PEERS FORTH WITH HER BLANK EYES
I HAVE NOW SAID ALL THAT OCCURS TO ME I HAVE OFTEN BEEN IMPRESSED WITH I HAVE OFTEN BEEN STRUCK WITH THE RESEMBLANCE I HAVE OFTEN
I HAVE ALL BUT FINISHED I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO I HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THE GROUND OF MY HOPE I HAVE ALREADY STATED AND NOW REPEAT
I FIND MY REFERENCE TO THIS I FIND MYSELF CALLED UPON TO SAY SOMETHING I FIND MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF I FIND NO BETTER EXAMPLE THAN
I HAVE BEEN GLAD TO OBSERVE I HAVE BEEN HERETOFORE TREATING I HAVE BEEN INSISTING THEN ON THIS I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN HEARING
I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK I HAVE NO SCRUPLE IN SAYING I HAVE NO SUCH GLOOMY FOREBODINGS I HAVE NO SYMPATHY WITH THE MEN
I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION I HAVE INCIDENTALLY DWELT ON I HAVE INTRODUCED IT TO SUGGEST I HAVE LABORED TO MAINTAIN
I DO NOT MISTRUST I DO NOT MYSELF PRETEND TO BE I DO NOT NEED TO REMIND YOU I DO NOT OF COURSE DENY I DO NOT PRETEND TO ARGUE
I DO NOT DESPAIR OF SURMOUNTING I DO NOT DISGUISE THE FACT I DO NOT ENTER INTO THE QUESTION I DO NOT FAIL TO ADMIRE
I HAVE THE CONFIDENT HOPE I HAVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CONFIDENCE I HAVE THE HONOR TO PROPOSE I HAVE THEN TO INVESTIGATE
AN OPEN WIT AND RECKLESSNESS OF BEARING AN OPPRESSIVE SENSE OF STRANGE SWEET ODOR AN OPTIMISTIC AFTER DINNER MOOD
I HAVE BEFORE ME THE STATISTICS I HAVE BUT ONE MORE WORD TO ADD I HAVE DEMONSTRATED TO YOU I HAVE DEPICTED
I DO NOT AT THIS MOMENT REMEMBER I DO NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE I DO NOT BELONG TO THOSE WHO I DO NOT CHOOSE TO CONSUME
I HAVE BEEN ALLOWED THE PRIVILEGE I HAVE BEEN ASKED SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY ANXIOUS I HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND
I DON'T THINK SO PARDON ME I MEANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT PERHAPS I AM INDISCREET PERHAPS NOT IN THE STRICTEST SENSE
I DO INDEED RECOLLECT I DO NOT ABSOLUTELY ASSERT I DO NOT ADVOCATE I DO NOT ARGUE I DO NOT ASK YOU TO
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION I HAVE ALWAYS LISTENED WITH THE GREATEST SATISFACTION I HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED I HAVE ANOTHER OBJECTION
I DO NOT PROPOSE TO TAKE UP YOUR TIME I DO NOT QUESTION FOR A MOMENT I DO NOT RECOUNT ALL I DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE FUTURE
I HAVE THROUGHOUT HIGHLY APPRECIATED I HAVE THUS BEEN LED BY MY FEELINGS I HAVE THUS STATED THE REASON
I FIND NO FAULT WITH I FIND NUMBERLESS CASES I FLATTER MYSELF I FOR MY PART WOULD RATHER
AN EXPRESSION OF MILDLY HUMOROUS SURPRISE AN EXPRESSION OF RARE AND INEXPLICABLE PERSONAL ENERGY AN EXQUISITE PERCEPTION OF THINGS BEAUTIFUL AND RARE
I ENTIRELY DISSENT FROM THE VIEW I ESPECIALLY HAIL WITH APPROVAL I EVEN ADD THIS I EVEN VENTURE TO DENY
SURELY THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT
I DO NOT IMAGINE I DO NOT IN THE LEAST DEGREE I DO NOT INDEED DENY I DO NOT INDULGE IN THE DELUSION
AN OVERBURDENING SENSE OF THE INEXPRESSIBLE AN UNCOMFORTABLE PREMONITION OF FEAR AN UNFAILING SWEETNESS AND UNERRING PERCEPTION
AGHAST AT HIS OWN HELPLESSNESS AGITATED AND ENTHRALLED BY DAY DREAMS AGITATED WITH VIOLENT AND CONTENDING EMOTIONS
SHE HAS AN EXTRAORDINARY GIFT OF CONVERSATION SHE IS EASILY PREJUDICED SHE SEEMS UNCOMMONLY APPRECIATIVE
I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT SUGGESTED I HAVE NEVER WHISPERED A SYLLABLE I HAVE NO ACQUAINTANCE WITH I HAVE NO DOUBT WHATEVER
I HOPE IT IS NO DISPARAGEMENT I HOPE MOST SINCERELY AND TRULY I HOPE NONE WHO HEAR ME
I DO NOT VOUCH FOR I DO NOT WANT TO DISCOURAGE YOU I DO NOT WISH TO BE CONSIDERED EGOTISTIC I DO NOT WISH TO BE MISREPRESENTED
APPREHENSIVE SOLICITUDE ABOUT THE FUTURE ARDENT WORDS OF ADMIRATION ARMED ALL OVER WITH SUBTLE ANTAGONISMS ARTLESS AND UNQUESTIONING DEVOTION
I HAVE LAID MUCH STRESS UPON I HAVE LATELY OBSERVED MANY STRONG INDICATIONS I HAVE LISTENED WITH THE UTMOST INTEREST
I HAVE FOUND GREAT CAUSE FOR WONDER I HAVE FREQUENTLY BEEN SURPRISED AT I HAVE GAZED WITH ADMIRATION I HAVE GENERALLY OBSERVED
I HAVE SEEN SOME SIGNS OF ENCOURAGEMENT I HAVE SHOWN I HAVE SOME SORT OF FEAR I HAVE SOMETIMES ASKED MYSELF
I EMBRACE WITH PECULIAR SATISFACTION I END AS I BEGAN I ENTERTAIN GREAT APPREHENSION FOR
I HAVE READ WITH GREAT REGRET I HAVE SAID AND I REPEAT I HAVE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN
I DO NOT KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN BELIEVE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE AWARE OF IT I DO NOT KNOW WHY I DO NOT KNOW WITH WHAT CORRECTNESS
I HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT HOW I HAVE BEEN PROFOUNDLY MOVED I HAVE BEEN REQUESTED TO SAY A WORD I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY AN EMINENT AUTHORITY
I HAVE WITNESSED THE EXTRAORDINARY I HAVE YET A MORE COGENT REASON I HAVE YET TO LEARN I HAZARD NOTHING IN SAYING
AN AIR HALF QUIZZICAL AND HALF DEFERENTIAL AN AIR OF AFFECTED CIVILITY AN AIR OF BEING METICULOUSLY EXPLICIT
I HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST I HAVE GOOD REASON FOR I HAVE HAD STEADILY IN MIND I HAVE HAD THE HONOR
YOU WILL DO WHAT YOU THINK BEST OH CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH IT OH DO NOT FORM AN ERRONEOUS IMPRESSION OH I APPRECIATE THAT IN YOU OH
MY ATTITUDE WOULD BE ONE OF DISAPPROVAL MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU IS ABSOLUTE MY IDEA OF IT IS QUITE THE REVERSE
JOIN US PLEASE WHEN YOU HAVE TIME JUST TRUST TO THE INSPIRATION OF THE MOMENT
I HAD OCCASION TO CRITICIZE I HAPPEN TO DIFFER I HARDLY DARE TO DWELL LONGER I HARDLY KNOW ANYTHING MORE STRANGE
I HOPE I HAVE EXPRESSED MYSELF EXPLICITLY I HOPE I MAY BE ALLOWED TO INTIMATE I HOPE I SHALL NOT BE TOLD
ACCIDENTS WHICH PERPETUALLY DEFLECT OUR VAGRANT ATTENTION ACROSS THE GULF OF YEARS ADMINISTERING A LITTLE DEFT THOUGH VEILED CASTIGATION
ONE ASSUMPTION YOU MAKE I SHOULD LIKE TO CONTEST ONE HAS NO CHOICE TO ENDURE IT ONE MUST BE INDULGENT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DENY I HAVE NOT PARTICULARLY REFERRED TO I HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING YET I HAVE NOT THE MEANS OF FORMING A JUDGMENT
I FEEL ONLY A GREAT EMOTION OF GRATITUDE I FEEL RESPECT AND ADMIRATION I FEEL SOME EXPLANATION IS DUE I FEEL SURE
I DO NOT THINK THIS AT ALL AN EXAGGERATION I DO NOT THINK WE CAN GO FAR WRONG I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL OFTEN HEAR I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN APPLY
I HOLD IT TO BE CLEARLY EXPEDIENT I HOLD MYSELF OBLIGED TO I HOLD THE MAXIM NO LESS APPLICABLE
AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WELL BRED WORLDLY CYNICISM AN ERECT MARTIAL MAJESTIC AND IMPOSING PERSONAGE AN ETERNITY OF SILENCE OPPRESSED HIM
DRIVE OUT ONE AND ANOTHER WILL TAKE HIS PLACE THEY PAY LIBERALLY FOR LOCATIONS PSHAW TEN DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ROCK AS BIG AS A BARN BUT THEY RENT THOUSANDS OF SUCH POSITIONS AND IN THE AGGREGATE OUR FARMERS GET LARGE SUMS FROM THEM
AND RUIN THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR HOMES AND FARMS MISTER WATSON SMILED THEY'RE NOT ARTISTS KEN THEY CAN'T REALIZE ON APPEARANCES BUT THEY CAN USE THE MONEY THE SIGNS BRING THEM THEY NEED TO BE EDUCATED THAT'S ALL
THESE FARMERS SEEM VERY HONEST DECENT FELLOWS THEY ARE KEN I WISH YOU KNEW THEM BETTER SO DO I MISTER WATSON THIS CAMPAIGN OUGHT TO BRING US CLOSER TOGETHER FOR I MEAN TO GET THEM TO HELP ME YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY THEM I'M AFRAID
WHICH PAINTED SIGNS WHEREVER IT COULD SECURE SPACE THESE SIGNS WERE NOT WORKS OF ART BUT THEY WERE DISTINCTLY HELPFUL TO BUSINESS AND ONLY A FOOL IN THE OPINION OF THE HONORABLE ERASTUS WOULD PROTEST AGAINST THE INEVITABLE WHAT BROUGHT THE LEGISLATOR TO THE MEETING
IF MYLES FANCIED THAT ONE SINGLE VICTORY OVER HIS ENEMY WOULD CURE THE EVIL AGAINST WHICH HE FOUGHT HE WAS GRIEVOUSLY MISTAKEN WRONGS ARE NOT RIGHTED SO EASILY AS THAT IT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING
WHEN THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE WERE GATHERED IN THE BRUTUS TOWER SEE YE NOT THAT THEY GROW AS BAD AS EVER AN WE PUT NOT A STOP TO THIS OVERMASTERY NOW IT WILL NEVER STOP BEST LET IT BE MYLES SAID WILKES THEY WILL KILL THEE AN THOU CEASE NOT TROUBLING THEM
HIS SOUL TOOK FIRE AND STUNG WITH A GENEROUS AMBITION OF EQUALING IN GLORY HIS EQUAL IN YEARS HE DETERMINED TO ASSIST WHILE HE EMULATED THE VICTOR TO THIS END
AND MY LORD WOULD NOT DARE TO PUNISH HIM EVEN FOR SUCH A MATTER AS THAT BUT TELL ME ROBIN INGOLDSBY
THEY WERE HAILED BY A GROUP OF THE BACHELORS STANDING AT THE STONE STEPS OF THE GREAT BUILDING HOLLOA FALWORTH THEY CRIED KNOWEST THOU THAT BLUNT IS NIGH WELL AGAIN NAY SAID MYLES I KNEW IT NOT BUT I AM RIGHT GLAD TO HEAR IT
WHEN THE DAWN BROKE HE AROSE FROM HIS HEATHER BED IN THE GREAT TOWER AND HAVING CALLED FORTH TWENTY OF THE BOTHWELL MEN TO ESCORT THEIR LORD HE TOLD IRELAND HE SHOULD EXPECT TO HAVE A CHEERING ACCOUNT OF THE WOUNDED ON HIS RETURN
AND DESERVED THEIR SUFFRAGES FOR RENOMINATION AND THEN HE BEGAN TO DISCUSS POLITICAL QUESTIONS IN GENERAL AND HIS OWN MERITS IN PARTICULAR SO THAT KENNETH AND MISTER WATSON DISGUSTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HAD CAPTURED THE MEETING
GIVE IT UP MY BOY ADVISED THE ELDER MAN LAYING A KINDLY HAND ON THE YOUTH'S SHOULDER IT REALLY ISN'T WORTH THE STRUGGLE BUT I CAN'T GIVE IT UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF BEATEN PROTESTED KENNETH ALMOST READY TO WEEP WITH DISAPPOINTMENT
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT NO OTHER COMPETING SIGNS WERE TO TAKE THEIR PLACE KENNETH PROMPTLY MAILED A CHECK FOR THE AMOUNT DEMANDED AND EARLY NEXT MORNING STARTED FOR THE GLEN WITH WHAT HE CALLED HIS ELIMINATORS THESE ELIMINATORS CONSISTED OF TWO MEN WITH CANS OF TURPENTINE
WHO WAS IT STOLE THEIR TANK IF THEY DID BUT KNOW HE SHOULD SMART FOR IT
TRUE ENOUGH IF YOU'RE SERIOUS KEN I'LL FRANKLY SAY THE THING CAN'T BE DONE YOU MAY PERHAPS BUY THE PRIVILEGE OF MAINTAINING THE ROCKS OF THE GLEN FREE FROM ADVERTISING BUT THE ADVERTISERS WILL PAINT MORE SIGNS ON ALL THE APPROACHES AND YOU WON'T HAVE GAINED MUCH
INDEED SOME WERE PROUD OF THEM AND BELIEVED IT A MARK OF DISTINCTION TO HAVE THEIR FENCES AND SHEDS ANNOUNCE AN EYE REMEDY OR SEVERAL VARIETIES OF PICKLES MISTER WATSON AT FIRST AN AMUSED OBSERVER OF THE CAMPAIGN SOON BECAME INDIGNANT AT THE WAY THAT KENNETH WAS RIDICULED AND REVILED
AND SANCTIONED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE EARL OF LENNOX WHOSE NAME HELD A GREAT INFLUENCE IN THOSE PARTS SEVERAL WHO BEFORE HAD HELD BACK FROM DOUBTING THEIR OWN JUDGMENT NOW CAME FORWARD AND NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED WELL APPOINTED MEN MARCHED INTO THE FORTRESS
I HEARD BLUNT TELL MOWBRAY TO GO AND GATHER THE OTHERS
SOME WERE TOO GREAT COWARDS TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS THEY WOULD GLADLY REGAIN BY THE EXERTIONS OF OTHERS
THEN HE JUMPED DOWN AGAIN FROM HIS ELEVATED STAND AND AN UPROAR OF CONFUSION INSTANTLY FILLED THE PLACE WHAT WAS THE EFFECT OF HIS WORDS UPON THE BACHELORS HE COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS THE RESULT HE WAS NOT SLOW IN DISCOVERING THE NEXT DAY
LISTENED TO THEM AS THEY DESCRIBED THE WEAPONS NAY NAY MASTER MYLES SAID HE WHEN MYLES HAD ENDED BY TELLING THE USE TO WHICH HE INTENDED PUTTING THEM THOU ART GOING ALL WRONG IN THIS MATTER WITH SUCH BLADES ERE THIS BATTLE IS ENDED SOME ONE WOULD BE SLAIN AND SO MURDER DONE
OR WERE VISITED IN VISION BY SOME HEROIC SHADE WHO OFFERED TO HIS SLEEPING FANCY DESIGNS FAR VASTER THAN HIS WAKING FACULTIES COULD HAVE CONCEIVED HE HAD THOUGHT THAT THE YOUNG WALLACE MIGHT HAVE WON DUMBARTON BY A BOLD STROKE AND THAT WHEN HIS INVINCIBLE COURAGE SHOULD BE STEERED BY STROKE
BLUNT'S COMPANIONS WERE TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM AGAINST SOMETHING BUT WITHOUT AVAIL IT WAS MYLES'S HEART THRILLED AND HIS BLOOD BOILED TO LIE IN WAIT FOR HIM TO OVERPOWER HIM BY NUMBERS AND TO MUTILATE HIM BY SLITTING HIS EARS
THOU WILT SING A DIFFERENT SONG ANON SAID ONE OF THE BACHELORS I TELL THEE HE IS HOT AGAINST THEE AND SWEARS WHEN HE COMETH AGAIN HE WILL CARVE THEE SOOTHLY AYE MARRY SAID ANOTHER
MYLES AND GASCOYNE WERE THROWING THEIR DAGGERS FOR A WAGER AT A WOODEN TARGET AGAINST THE WALL BACK OF THE ARMORER'S SMITHY
AMONG THEM WAS THAT OF HIS TASKMASTER FEARING PUNISHMENT FOR HIS NEGLECTED DUTY HE HAD SLIPPED OUT OF THE COT AND HIDDEN HIMSELF BENEATH IT THOSE WHO HAD ENTERED WERE WALTER BLUNT AND THREE OF THE OLDER BACHELORS
THAT NIGHT AS THE YOUNGSTERS WERE SHOUTING AND ROMPING AND SKYLARKING AS THEY ALWAYS DID BEFORE TURNING IN HE STOOD UPON HIS COT AND SHOUTED SILENCE LIST TO ME A LITTLE AND THEN IN THE HUSH THAT FOLLOWED
EVEN BEFORE THAT COMING THE BACHELORS HAD SOMEWHAT RECOVERED FROM THEIR DEMORALIZATION AND NOW AGAIN THEY BEGAN TO PLUCK UP THEIR CONFIDENCE AND TO ORDER THE YOUNGER SQUIRES AND PAGES UPON THIS PERSONAL SERVICE OR UPON THAT SEE YE NOT SAID MYLES ONE DAY
LET THEM ADVERTISE IN DECENT WAYS THEN WHAT RIGHT HAS ANY SOAP MAKER TO FLAUNT HIS WARES IN MY FACE WHETHER I'M INTERESTED IN THEM OR NOT THE RIGHT OF CUSTOM
MYLES HAD RISEN AND WAS NOW STANDING LISTENING WITH THE OTHERS WHEN BLUNT HAD ENDED READING THE LIST OF NAMES HE ROLLED UP THE PARCHMENT AND THRUST IT INTO HIS BELT THEN SWINGING SUDDENLY ON HIS HEEL HE STRODE STRAIGHT UP TO MYLES FACING HIM FRONT TO FRONT
THEY SOLD THIS BREAKFAST FOOD TO THOUSANDS OF FARMERS TO GIVE THEM HEALTH AND STRENGTH TO HARVEST ANOTHER CROP OF OATS THUS HE BENEFITED THE COMMUNITY GOING AND COMING WHAT SHOULD HE NOT ADVERTISE THIS MUTUAL BENEFIT COMMODITY WHEREVER HE PLEASED AND ESPECIALLY AMONG THE FARMERS
THIS HAS BEEN YOUR DOING MY KIND BROTHER SAID HE BUT HOW CAME YOU TO DISCOVER ME I MISSED YOU WHEN THE DAWN BROKE AND AT LAST FOUND YOU HERE SLEEPING UNDER THE DEW AND HAS NONE ELSE BEEN ASTIR INQUIRED WALLACE THINKING OF THE FIGURE HE HAD SEEN
THE GATHERING HAD AT FIRST THE APPEARANCE OF BEING A POLITICAL ONE SO ENTIRELY DID THE REPRESENTATIVE DOMINATE IT BUT MISTER WATSON TOOK THE PLATFORM AND SHYLY INTRODUCED THE SPEAKER OF THE EVENING THE FARMERS ALL KNEW MISTER WATSON AND LIKED HIM
EVEN MYLES STOPPED IN HIS SPEECH FOR A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED WITH A BEATING HEART AND A CARELESSNESS OF MANNER THAT WAS ALTOGETHER ASSUMED IN HIS HAND BLUNT CARRIED THE HOUSE ORDERS FOR THE DAY AND WITHOUT SEEMING TO NOTICE MYLES HE OPENED IT AND READ THE LIST OF THOSE CALLED UPON FOR HOUSEHOLD SERVICE
HE WILL NOT DARE TO TOUCH ME TO HARM ME I FEAR HIM NOT NEVERTHELESS HE DID NOT SPEAK THE FULL FEELINGS OF HIS HEART I KNOW NOT MYLES SAID GASCOYNE SHAKING HIS HEAD DOUBTFULLY
NEVER WILL I FORGET OR FORGIVE THAT OFFENCE AND WILL HAVE A RECKONING WITH THEE RIGHT SOON THAT THOU WILT NOT FORGET TO THE LAST DAY OF THY LIFE WHEN MYLES HAD SEEN HIS ENEMY TURN UPON HIM HE DID NOT KNOW AT FIRST WHAT TO EXPECT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED HAD THEY COME TO BLOWS THERE AND THEN
OTHER AND FAR MORE BITTER BATTLES LAY BEFORE HIM ERE HE COULD LOOK AROUND HIM AND SAY I HAVE WON THE VICTORY FOR A DAY FOR TWO DAYS THE BACHELORS WERE DEMORALIZED AT THE FALL OF THEIR LEADER
NO MISTER WATSON I'M SET ON THIS IT'S A CRIME TO ALLOW THESE SIGNS TO FLAUNT THEMSELVES IN OUR PRETTIEST SCENES MY INSTINCT REVOLTS AT THE DESECRATION BESIDES
AN THOU STOP NOT THINE OUTCRY I WILL CUT THY THROAT FOR THEE AND HE MADE A FEROCIOUS GESTURE WITH HIS DAGGER IT WAS BY NO MEANS EASY TO WORM THE STORY FROM THE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MONKEY HE KNEW MYLES TOO WELL TO BE IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF HIS THREATS
ON THE FARM NEAREST TO ELMHURST AT THE NORTH WHICH BELONGED TO A MAN NAMED WEBB WAS A BARN FACING THE ROAD THAT DISPLAYED ON ITS SIDE A TOBACCO SIGN KENNETH INTERVIEWED MISTER WEBB AND FOUND THAT HE RECEIVED NO MONEY FOR THE SIGN BUT THE MAN CONTENDED
THERE SAID HE STILL PANTING FROM THE CHASE AND SEATING THE BOY BY NO MEANS GENTLY UPON THE BENCH BESIDE WILKES SIT THOU THERE THOU IMP OF EVIL AND NOW TELL ME WHAT THOU DIDST MEAN BY THY WORDS ANON
AND SUMMONING HIS LITTLE RESERVE THEY MARCHED WITH FLYING PENNONS THROUGH THE TOWN OF DUMBARTON
EVEN IF MYLES HAD ENTERTAINED COMFORTING THOUGHTS TO THE CONTRARY HE WAS SPEEDILY UNDECEIVED ONE MORNING ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE FIGHT AS HE AND GASCOYNE WERE CROSSING THE ARMORY COURT
AND GASOLINE AND AN EQUIPMENT OF SCRUBBING BRUSHES PARSONS THE FARMER CAME OVER TO WATCH THIS NOVEL PROCEEDING HAPPY IN THE POSSESSION OF THREE CRISP FIVE DOLLAR NOTES GIVEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT MADE WITH HIM
IT WOULD COST THE BOY SOMETHING BUT HE WOULD GAIN HIS MONEY'S WORTH IN EXPERIENCE AFTER A FEW DAYS THE SIGN PAINTER ANSWERED THE LETTER HE WOULD RELINQUISH THE THREE SIGNS IN THE GLEN FOR A PAYMENT OF FIFTY DOLLARS EACH
BUT EXPOSE THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE REVENGE OF A RESENTFUL ENEMY THIS WAS THE BEST APOLOGY OF ANY THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED NATURAL AFFECTION WAS THE PLEADER AND THOUGH BLINDED TO ITS TRUE INTEREST SUCH WEAKNESS HAD AN AMIABLE SOURCE AND SO WAS PARDONED
WHICH ALONE SEEMED TO DIVIDE HIM FROM THE VENERABLE SIR RONALD CRAWFORD AND HIS YOUTHFUL HAUNTS AT AYR FULL OF THOUGHTS OF HER WHO USED TO SHARE THOSE HAPPY SCENES HE HEARD A SIGH BEHIND HIM HE TURNED ROUND AND BEHELD A FEMALE FIGURE DISAPPEAR AMONG THE TREES
HIS COUNTRY'S ENEMIES HAD LEVELED WITH THE GROUND HE TURNED IN ANGUISH OF HEART TOWARD THE SOUTH FOR THERE LESS RACKING REMEMBRANCES HOVERED OVER THE DISTANT HILLS LEANING ON THE SHATTERED STUMP OF AN OLD TREE HE FIXED HIS EYES ON THE FAR STRETCHING PLAIN
BUT HIS ENERGY WAS NOT EXHAUSTED NO ONE EVER KNEW WHAT IT COST IN LABOR AND MATERIAL TO ERASE THOSE THREE SIGNS BUT AFTER TEN DAYS THEY HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY AND THE BOY HEAVED A SIGH OF SATISFACTION AND TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO EXTENDING THE CAMPAIGN
AND THAT WHEN HIS INVINCIBLE COURAGE SHOULD BE STEERED BY GRAVER HEADS EVERY SUCCESS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM HIS ARMS AND SAW THAT WHEN TURNED TO ANY CAUSE OF POLICY THE GORDIAN KNOT OF IT HE DID UNLOOSE FAMILIAR AS HIS GARTER HE MARVELED AND SAID WITHIN HIMSELF
SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO LECTURE HIM ON FISHING IN TROUBLED WATERS AND WARNED HIM IF HE WOULD KEEP HIS HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS TO WEAR HIS YOKE IN PEACE OTHERS THOUGHT THE PROJECT TOO ARDUOUS FOR MEN OF SMALL MEANS
THAT BRAVE KNIGHT HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THE VERY SAME NIGHT IN WHICH DE VALENCE FLED BEFORE THE ARMS OF WALLACE ACROSS THE CLYDE AND HE NO SOONER SAW THE SCOTTISH COLORS ON THE WALLS OF DUMBARTON THAN FINDING OUT WHO WAS THEIR PLANTER
AND WHERE THE POSSESSION OF SUCH A CASTLE WOULD COMPEL THE NEIGHBORING ONES TO SURRENDER AND WHERE OCCUPYING THE HILLS WITH BANDS OF RESOLUTE SCOTS WOULD BE A MORE EFFICIENT BULWARK THAN A THOUSAND TOWERS THAT MAXWELL GAZED ON HIM WITH ADMIRATION AND LENNOX WITH WONDER
WHEN HE AWOKE THE LARK WAS CAROLING ABOVE HIS HEAD AND TO HIS SURPRISE HE FOUND A PLAID WAS LAID OVER HIM HE THREW IT OFF AND BEHELD EDWIN SEATED AT HIS FEET
I'LL DRIVE EVERY ADVERTISING SIGN OUT OF THIS COUNTRY IMPOSSIBLE THE GREAT CORPORATIONS WHO CONTROL THESE INDUSTRIES MAKE THEIR FORTUNES BY THIS STYLE OF ADVERTISING THE RURAL DISTRICTS ARE THEIR STRONGHOLDS AND THEY MUST ADVERTISE OR THEY CAN'T SELL THEIR PRODUCTS
HE TRAVERSED THE ADJOINING COUNTRY STRIVING TO ENLIGHTEN THE UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE STUPIDLY SATISFIED AND TO EXCITE THE DISCONTENTED TO REVOLT WITH MOST HE FAILED
A COUNCIL BEING HELD RESPECTING THE DISPOSAL OF THE NEW TROOPS IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE LENNOX MEN MUST REMAIN WITH THEIR EARL IN GARRISON WHILE THOSE BROUGHT BY MAXWELL AND UNDER HIS COMMAND SHOULD FOLLOW WALLACE IN THE PROSECUTION OF HIS CONQUESTS ALONG WITH HIS OWN ESPECIAL PEOPLE
PRITHEE TELL IT ME ROBIN WHERE DO THEY PROPOSE TO LIE IN WAIT FOR FALWORTH IN THE GATE WAY OF THE BUTTERY COURT SO AS TO CATCH HIM WHEN HE PASSES BY TO THE ARMORY ANSWERED THE BOY ARE THEY THERE NOW SAID WILKES AYE NINE OF THEM SAID ROBIN
YOU WILL SEND YOUR HIRELINGS TO TOW HIM IN BUT IF A PLANK COULD SAVE HIM NOW YOU WOULD NOT THROW IT TO HIM I UNDERSTAND YOU SIRS AND SHALL TROUBLE YOUR PATRIOTISM NO MORE IN SHORT
IT WAS GASCOYNE WHO SUGGESTED THE PLAN WHICH THEY AFTERWARDS FOLLOWED THEN WILKES STARTED AWAY TO GATHER TOGETHER THOSE OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE NOT UPON HOUSEHOLD DUTY
BLUNT IS GOING TO SERVE THEE OUT TO DAY AND I MYSELF HEARD HIM SAY SO HE SAYS HE IS GOING TO SLIT THINE EARS AND THEN HE WAS GONE AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD APPEARED MYLES DARTED AFTER HIM CAUGHT HIM MIDWAY IN THE QUADRANGLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK BY THE SCUFF OF THE NECK SQUALLING AND STRUGGLING
AND HE HELD HIMSELF PREPARED FOR ANY EVENT HE FACED THE OTHER PLUCKILY ENOUGH AND WITHOUT FLINCHING AND SPOKE UP BOLDLY IN ANSWER SO BE IT WALTER BLUNT I FEAR THEE NOT IN WHATEVER WAY THOU MAYST ENCOUNTER ME
ALL DAY THE TWO MEN SCRUBBED THE ROCKS FAITHFULLY ASSISTED AT ODD TIMES BY THEIR IMPATIENT EMPLOYER BUT THE THICK SPLASHES OF PAINT CLUNG DESPERATELY TO THE RUGGED SURFACE OF THE ROCK AND THE TASK WAS A HARD ONE
NO ONE DOUBTED THAT WILKES HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH IN HIS TAUNT AND THAT THE BACHELORS HAD INDEED STOLEN THEIR OWN TANK SO NO MORE WATER WAS EVER CARRIED FOR THE HEAD SQUIRES BUT IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT THE WAR FOR THE UPPERHAND WAS NOT YET OVER
NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE NOVEL IDEAS OF THE YOUNG ARTIST AS BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED TO BE AMUSED BY HEARING THE BOYISH MASTER OF ELMHURST LECTURE AT EM SO THEY FILLED THE LITTLE ROOM TO OVERFLOWING AND TO ADD TO THE DIGNITY OF THE PROCEEDINGS
THEN THE FAMILY OF HIM WHO WAS KILLED WOULD HAPLY HAVE YE CITED
LEFT THE SCHOOL HOUSE AND INDIGNANTLY RETURNED TO ELMHURST THIS MAN HOPKINS SAID MISTER WATSON ANGRILY IS NOT A GENTLEMAN HE'S AN IMPERTINENT MEDDLER HE RUINED ANY GOOD EFFECT MY SPEECH MIGHT HAVE CREATED SAID KENNETH GLOOMILY
BUT IT FLED AND AGAIN VANISHED HE DROPPED UPON THE GROUND IN SPEECHLESS DISAPPOINTMENT TIS FALSE CRIED HE RECOVERING FROM HIS FIRST EXPECTATION TIS A PHANTOM OF MY OWN CREATING
IT WAS JUST AFTER CHAPEL AND THE WHOLE BODY OF SQUIRES WAS GATHERED IN THE ARMORY WAITING FOR THE ORDERS OF THE DAY AND THE CALLING OF THE ROLL OF THOSE CHOSEN FOR HOUSEHOLD DUTY MYLES WAS SITTING ON A BENCH ALONG THE WALL TALKING AND JESTING WITH SOME WHO STOOD BY
A DISGRACEFUL PUNISHMENT ADMINISTERED AS A RULE ONLY FOR THIEVING AND POACHING HE WOULD NOT DARE TO DO SUCH A THING CRIED MYLES WITH HEAVING BREAST AND FLASHING EYES AYE BUT HE WOULD SAID GASCOYNE HIS FATHER LORD REGINALD BLUNT IS A GREAT MAN OVER NOTTINGHAM WAY
I TAKE NO SUCH COWARD'S PART AS THAT I SAY AN THEY HUNGER TO FIGHT GIVE THEM THEIR STOMACHFUL THE OTHERS WERE VERY RELUCTANT FOR SUCH EXTREME MEASURES BUT MYLES AS USUAL CARRIED HIS WAY AND SO A PITCHED BATTLE WAS DECIDED UPON
THAT HE FORGOT THAT IT WAS HIS FIRST PUBLIC SPEECH AND THOUGHT ONLY OF IMPRESSING HIS HEARERS WITH HIS VIEWS EXULTING IN THE FACT THAT ON THIS OCCASION THEY COULD NOT TALK BACK AS THEY USUALLY DID IN PRIVATE
THERE MY DEAR LORD SAID HE PRESENTING IT IT WILL NOT DISHONOR YOUR HAND FOR IT CUT DOWN MANY A PROUD NORWEGIAN ON THE FIELD OF LARGS WALLACE TOOK THE SWORD AND TURNED TO MEET MURRAY WITH EDWIN IN THE PORTAL WHEN THEY REACHED THE CITADEL
SUCH WERE HIS WORDS SUCH WERE HIS THOUGHTS TILL THE COLDNESS OF THE HOUR AND THE EXHAUSTION OF NATURE PUTTING A FRIENDLY SEAL UPON HIS SENSES HE SUNK UPON THE BANK AND FELL INTO A PROFOUND SLEEP
HE WAS TRYING HIS ELOQUENCE AMONG THE CLAN AT LENNOX WHEN KER ARRIVING STAMPED HIS PERSUASIONS WITH TRUTH AND ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED MEN ARRANGED THEMSELVES UNDER THEIR LORD'S STANDARD MAXWELL GLADLY EXPLAINED HIMSELF TO WALLACE'S LIEUTENANT
HE APPEALED TO THEM TO HELP HIM IN DRIVING ALL THE ADVERTISING SIGNS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY WHEN HE ENDED THEY APPLAUDED HIS SPEECH MILDLY BUT IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE REASON THAT HE HAD SPOKEN SO FORCIBLY AND WELL THEN
HE WANTED THE YOUNG MAN TO ROUSE HIMSELF AND TAKE AN INTEREST IN LIFE AND IF HIS ANTAGONISM TO ADVERTISING SIGNS WOULD EFFECT THIS
ONE EVENING THE BACHELORS WERE MORE THAN USUALLY NOISY IN THEIR END OF THE DORMITORY LAUGHING AND TALKING AND SHOUTING TO ONE ANOTHER HOLLOA YOU SIRRAH FALWORTH CALLED ONE OF THEM ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM BLUNT COMETH AGAIN TO MORROW DAY
I DO INDEED FEAR ME THAT HE MEANETH TO DO THEE EVIL I KNOW NOT SAID MYLES BOLDLY BUT I FEAR HIM NOT NEVERTHELESS HIS HEART WAS HEAVY WITH THE WEIGHT OF IMPENDING ILL
THE PURE SPIRIT OF MARION WOULD NEVER FLY FROM ME I LOVED HER TOO WELL SHE WOULD NOT THUS REDOUBLE MY GRIEF BUT I SHALL GO TO THEE WIFE OF MY SOUL CRIED HE AND THAT IS COMFORT BALM INDEED IS THE CHRISTIAN'S HOPE
THEY WISHED WELL TO THE ARMS OF SIR WILLIAM WALLACE AND SHOULD HE CONTINUE SUCCESSFUL WOULD WATCH THE MOMENT TO AID HIM WITH ALL THEIR LITTLE POWER THOSE WHO HAD MUCH PROPERTY FEARED TO RISK ITS LOSS BY EMBRACING A DOUBTFUL STRUGGLE
WALTER BLUNT IS A PARLOUS EVIL MINDED KNAVE AND METHINKS WILL DO WHATEVER EVIL HE PROMISETH I FEAR HIM NOT SAID MYLES AGAIN BUT HIS HEART FOREBODED TROUBLE
AND ACKNOWLEDGED FRANKLY THAT IT WAS A PITY TO DECORATE THEIR PREMISES WITH SIGNS OF PATENT MEDICINES AND QUESTIONABLE SOAPS BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM SNEERED AT THE CHAMPION AND MANY REFUSED POINT BLANK TO CONSIDER ANY PROPOSITION TO DISCARD THE ADVERTISEMENTS
THAT HE WOULD HAVE THY BLOOD FOR THE FALL THOU GAVEST HIM LOOK TO THYSELF FALWORTH HE COMETH AGAIN WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY NEXT THOU STANDEST IN A PARLOUS STATE MYLES SAID GASCOYNE AS THEY ENTERED THE GREAT QUADRANGLE
THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS QUICK TO CATCH THE LACK OF SYMPATHY IN THE AUDIENCE STOOD UP AND BEGGED LEAVE TO REPLY TO YOUNG FORBES HE SAID THE OBJECTION TO ADVERTISING SIGNS WAS ONLY A RICH MAN'S ARISTOCRATIC HOBBY
LORD MAR BETWEEN MURRAY AND EDWIN FOLLOWED AND THE SERVANTS AND GUARD COMPLETED THE SUIT BEING WELL MOUNTED THEY PLEASANTLY PURSUED THEIR WAY AVOIDING ALL INHABITED PLACES AND RESTING IN THE DEEPEST RECESSES OF THE HILLS
WHAT ARISTOCRATIC NOTION COULD PREVENT HIM IT WAS A MIGHTY GOOD THING FOR THE FARMERS TO BE REMINDED BY MEANS OF THE SIGNS ON THEIR BARNS AND FENCES OF THE THINGS THEY NEEDED IN DAILY LIFE IF THE YOUNG MAN AT ELMHURST WOULD LIKE TO BE OF PUBLIC SERVICE
THE SILVER LIGHT OF THE STARS WAS NOT BRIGHTER THAN ITS AIRY ROBES WHICH FLOATED IN THE WIND HIS HEART PAUSED IT BEAT VIOLENTLY STILL THE FIGURE ADVANCED
LORD MAR PROPOSED TRAVELING ALL NIGHT BUT AT THE CLOSE OF THE EVENING HIS COUNTESS COMPLAINED OF FATIGUE DECLARING SHE COULD NOT ADVANCE FURTHER THAN THE EASTERN BANK OF THE RIVER CART
FINDING EVERYBODY READY HE TOOK HIS STATION AND SETTING FORTH ALL PROCEEDED CHEERFULLY THOUGH SLOWLY THROUGH THE DELIGHTFUL VALLEYS OF BAROCHAN BY SUNSET THEY ARRIVED AT THE POINT OF EMBARKATION
KENNETH FLUSHED RED HE WAS BY NATURE SHY AND RETIRING TO A DEGREE ONLY HIS PENT UP ENTHUSIASM HAD CARRIED HIM THROUGH THE ORDEAL AND NOW THAT IT WAS OVER HE WAS CHAGRINED TO THINK THAT THE SPEECH HAD BEEN SO INEFFECTIVE
THOU'LT HAVE CAUSE TO FEAR ME ERE I AM THROUGH WITH THEE HE SMILED A BALEFUL LINGERING SMILE AND THEN TURNED SLOWLY AND WALKED AWAY WHAT THINKEST THOU MYLES SAID GASCOYNE AS THE TWO LEFT THE ARMORY TOGETHER I THINK NAUGHT SAID MYLES GRUFFLY
MYLES SAW GASCOYNE DIRECT A SHARP GLANCE AT HIM BUT HE ANSWERED NOTHING EITHER TO HIS ENEMY'S WORDS OR HIS FRIEND'S LOOK AS THE BACHELOR HAD SAID BLUNT CAME THE NEXT MORNING
ALL BECOMES CLEAR THAT LEADS TO IT ZEAL IN SUCH CASES IS ALMOST GENIUS SOON AFTER THESE OBSERVATIONS IT WAS ADMITTED THAT WALLACE MIGHT ATTEND LORD MAR AND HIS FAMILY ON THE MORROW TO THE ISLE OF BUTE
HOW HE HAD REDEEMED THE GLEN FROM ITS DISGRACEFUL CONDITION AND RESTORED IT TO ITS FORMER BEAUTY HE ASKED THEM TO OBSERVE WEBB'S PRETTY HOMESTEAD NO LONGER MARRED BY THE UNSIGHTLY SIGN UPON THE BARN AND THEN
WHEN OF A SUDDEN HIS HEART GAVE A GREAT LEAP WITHIN HIM IT WAS WALTER BLUNT HE CAME WALKING IN AT THE DOOR AS IF NOTHING HAD PASSED AND AT HIS UNEXPECTED COMING THE HUBBUB OF TALK AND LAUGHTER WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED
SO HE EXHORTED THEM EARNESTLY TO KEEP THEIR HOMES BEAUTIFUL AND FREE FROM THE DEGRADATION OF ADVERTISING AND NEVER TO PERMIT GLARING COMMERCIALISM TO MAR THE SCENERY AROUND THEM HE TOLD THEM WHAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BY HIMSELF IN A SHORT TIME
SO WHEN KENNETH ROSE THEY PREPARED TO LISTEN IN RESPECTFUL SILENCE USUALLY A YOUNG MAN MAKING HIS MAIDEN SPEECH IS SOMEWHAT DIFFIDENT BUT YOUNG FORBES WAS SO THOROUGHLY IN EARNEST AND SO INDIGNANT AT THE OPPOSITION THAT HIS PLANS HAD ENCOUNTERED
THAT THOU WERT GOING THITHER FOR THY ARBALIST THIS MORN TO SHOOT AT THE ROOKS WITHAL THAT WILL DO ROBIN SAID MYLES THOU MAYST GO AND THEREWITH THE LITTLE IMP SCURRIED OFF PULLING THE LOBES OF HIS EARS SUGGESTIVELY AS HE DARTED AROUND THE CORNER
BUT WHEN SCOTLAND LOST HER FREEDOM AS THE SWORD WAS NOT DRAWN IN HER DEFENSE I LOOKED NOT WHERE IT LAY I THEN STUDIED THE ARTS OF PEACE THAT IS OVER AND NOW THE PASSION OF MY SOUL REVIVES WHEN THE MIND IS BENT ON ONE OBJECT ONLY
E N THOUGH MY TRADE BE MAKING OF BLADES RATHER WOULD I HA A GOOD STOUT CUDGEL IN MY HAND THAN THE BEST DAGGER THAT EVER WAS FORGED MYLES STOOD THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MOMENT OR TWO THEN LOOKING UP
AND SEEING THEM LAID TO REST PLANTED HIS MEN TO KEEP GUARD AROUND THE CIRCLE THE MOON HAD SUNK IN THE WEST BEFORE THE WHOLE OF HIS LITTLE CAMP WERE ASLEEP BUT WHEN ALL SEEMED COMPOSED HE WANDERED FORTH BY THE DIM LIGHT OF THE STARS TO VIEW THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY
HE MIGHT FIND SOME BETTER WAY TO DO SO THAN BY ADVANCING SUCH CRAZY IDEAS BUT THIS CONTINUED THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS A SUBJECT OF SMALL IMPORTANCE WHAT HE WISHED ESPECIALLY TO CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD SERVED THE DISTRICT FAITHFULLY AS REPRESENTATIVE
CHAPTER THREE DON QUIXOTE WHEN KENNETH GOT HOME HE TOLD MISTER WATSON OF HIS DISCOVERY AND ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO WRITE TO THE SIGN PAINTER AND FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE DONE THE LAWYER LAUGHED HEARTILY AT HIS YOUNG FRIEND'S WHIM BUT AGREED TO HELP HIM
MAR HAD SEEN THE POWER OF HIS ARMS MURRAY HAD ALREADY DRUNK THE EXPERIENCE OF A VETERAN FROM HIS GENIUS HENCE THEY WERE NOT SURPRISED ON HEARING THAT WHICH FILLED STRANGERS WITH AMAZEMENT
WAS THE FACT THAT HE WAS COMING FORWARD FOR RE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER AND BELIEVED THAT THIS AFFORDED A GOOD CHANCE TO MEET SOME OF HIS CONSTITUENTS AND MAKE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION SO HE CAME EARLY AND SHOOK HANDS WITH EVERYONE THAT ARRIVED AND AFTERWARD TOOK AS PROMINENT A SEAT AS POSSIBLE INDEED
AND THAT IT COULD NOT BE INDULGED IN A DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITY OF HONEST PEOPLE HIS OWN FIRM HE SAID BOUGHT THOUSANDS OF BUSHELS OF OATS FROM THE FARMERS AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE CELEBRATED EAGLE EYE BREAKFAST FOOD THREE PACKAGES FOR A QUARTER
AND THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROSE WERE PROPORTIONATELY UPLIFTED THE DAY THAT BLUNT MET HIS FALL
THE HON ERASTUS HOPKINS STATE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE DISTRICT LENT HIS PRESENCE TO THE ASSEMBLAGE NOT THAT THE HONORABLE ERASTUS CARED A FIG ABOUT THIS FOOLISH TALK OF EXTERMINATING ADVERTISING SIGNS HE WAS HIMSELF A LARGE STOCKHOLDER IN A BREAKFAST FOOD FACTORY
SMOKE YE NOT THEIR TRICKS LADS SEE YE NOT THAT THEY HAVE STOLEN THEIR OWN WATER TANK SO THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE NO NEED FOR ANOTHER FIGHT OVER THE CARRYING OF THE WATER THE BACHELORS MADE AN OBVIOUS SHOW OF NOT HAVING HEARD WHAT HE SAID AND A GENERAL LAUGH WENT AROUND
NOT ALL OF THEM THERE MUST BE SOME REFINEMENT AMONG THEM BUT THE LAWYER WAS NOT CONVINCED HOWEVER IT WAS NOT HIS DESIRE TO STIFLE THIS NEW BORN ENTHUSIASM OF KENNETH'S EVEN THOUGH HE BELIEVED IT MISDIRECTED
AND NOW AND THEN APPLAUDING A MORE THAN USUALLY WELL AIMED CAST OF THE KNIFE SUDDENLY THAT IMPISH LITTLE PAGE SPOKEN OF BEFORE ROBIN INGOLDSBY THRUST HIS SHOCK HEAD AROUND THE CORNER OF THE SMITHY AND SAID HO FALWORTH
PEOPLE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THESE THINGS SO LONG THAT THE MANUFACTURERS CONSIDER THEMSELVES JUSTIFIED IN COVERING EVERY BARN ROCK AND FENCE WITH THEIR SIGNS I SEE NO WAY TO STOP THEM NOR I AT PRESENT BUT THERE MUST BE A WAY
AND A FEW BRAVE SPIRITS WHO WOULD PUT ALL TO THE HAZARD FOR SO GOOD A CAUSE COULD BE PREVAILED ON TO HOLD THEMSELVES IN READINESS TO OBEY SIR EUSTACE WHEN HE SHOULD SEE THE MOMENT TO CONDUCT THEM TO SIR WILLIAM WALLACE
WELL WELL LET'S THINK IT OVER KEN AND SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE PERHAPS THAT RASCALLY HOPKINS WAS RIGHT WHEN HE ADVISED YOU TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY I CAN'T DO BETTER THAN TO MAKE IT CLEAN TO DO AWAY WITH THESE DISREPUTABLE SIGNS SAID THE BOY STUBBORNLY
YOU FOR IT IS NO PARTIALITY OF MINE I ASSURE YOU WHAT OTHER PEOPLE MAY THINK OF THE RIGHTNESS OR WRONGNESS IS NOTHING IN COMPARISON TO MY OWN DEEP KNOWLEDGE MY INNATE CONVICTION THAT IT WAS WRONG
IT WAS NO EXPLANATION BY DINT OF QUESTIONING MARGARET EXTRACTED FROM HER THE HORRIBLE FACT THAT BETTY BARNES HAVING BEEN INDUCED BY A GYPSY FORTUNE TELLER TO LEND THE LATTER HER HUSBAND'S SUNDAY CLOTHES
QUITE SURE THAT IS IF YOU DON'T WALK SO FAST YOU SEE
AND WHIRLING AWAY PAST THE WELL KNOWN STATIONS SEEING THE OLD SOUTH COUNTRY TOWNS AND HAMLETS SLEEPING IN THE WARM LIGHT OF THE PURE SUN
YOU WOULD THINK IT ROMANTIC TO BE WALKING WITH A PERSON FAT AND SCANT O BREATH IF I WERE HAMLET PRINCE OF DENMARK HAVE COMPASSION ON MY INFIRMITIES FOR HIS SAKE
I DON'T KNOW I NEVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING OF THAT KIND SAID MARGARET REDDENING AND LOOKING HURT AND OFFENDED AND PERHAPS HE NEVER WOULD BUT FOR THE LIE WHICH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I MAINTAIN WAS NECESSARY
THE BUZZ OF VOICES LIKE THE MURMUR OF A HIVE OF BUSY HUMAN BEES MADE ITSELF HEARD AS SOON AS THEY EMERGED FROM THE FOREST ON THE MORE OPEN VILLAGE GREEN ON WHICH THE SCHOOL WAS SITUATED
SO SHE TURNED TO HER AND ASKED HOW IS OLD BETTY BARNES I DON'T KNOW SAID THE WOMAN RATHER SHORTLY WE'SE NOT FRIENDS WHY NOT ASKED MARGARET WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN THE PEACEMAKER OF THE VILLAGE SHE STOLE MY CAT
BUT IN AN INSTANT SHE HAD CONQUERED THIS FEELING AND MODESTLY ADVANCED MEETING MANY A BRIGHT GLANCE OF RECOGNITION AND HEARING MANY A HALF SUPPRESSED MURMUR OF IT'S MISS HALE THE VICAR'S LADY HEARD THE NAME AND HER MANNER AT ONCE BECAME MORE KINDLY
NOTHING HAD BEEN THE SAME AND THIS SLIGHT ALL PERVADING INSTABILITY HAD GIVEN HER GREATER PAIN THAN IF ALL HAD BEEN TOO ENTIRELY CHANGED FOR HER TO RECOGNISE IT I BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT HEAVEN MUST BE AND OH
WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS SO ABSORBED IN THE SIMPLE ACT OF WATCHING THAT IT MADE THE TRAVELLERS WONDER WHAT HE COULD FIND TO DO WHEN THE TRAIN WHIRLED AWAY AND ONLY THE BLANK OF A RAILWAY SOME SHEDS
AND SOMEHOW THIS VISIT TO HELSTONE HAD NOT BEEN ALL HAD NOT BEEN EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED THERE WAS CHANGE EVERYWHERE SLIGHT YET PERVADING ALL
HER FATHER WAS MY OLDEST FRIEND AND SHE'S MY GOD DAUGHTER SO I THOUGHT WE WOULD JUST COME DOWN TOGETHER AND SEE THE OLD PLACE AND I KNOW OF OLD YOU CAN GIVE US COMFORTABLE ROOMS AND A CAPITAL DINNER YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME I SEE BUT MY NAME IS BELL
NOT BUT WHAT I HAVE TOLD A PRETTY ROUND NUMBER IN MY LIFE NOT ALL IN DOWNRIGHT WORDS AS I SUPPOSE YOU DID BUT IN ACTIONS OR IN SOME SHABBY CIRCUMLOCUTORY WAY LEADING PEOPLE EITHER TO DISBELIEVE THE TRUTH
WHILE THE FIRST CLASS SOUGHT FOR THEIR BOOKS AND THE VICAR'S LADY WENT AS NEAR AS A LADY COULD TOWARDS HOLDING MISTER BELL BY THE BUTTON WHILE SHE EXPLAINED THE PHONETIC SYSTEM TO HIM AND GAVE HIM A CONVERSATION SHE HAD HAD WITH THE INSPECTOR ABOUT IT
BEFORE THEY LEFT MARGARET STOLE ROUND TO THE BACK OF THE VICARAGE GARDEN AND GATHERED A LITTLE STRAGGLING PIECE OF HONEYSUCKLE SHE WOULD NOT TAKE A FLOWER THE DAY BEFORE FOR FEAR OF BEING OBSERVED AND HER MOTIVES AND FEELINGS COMMENTED UPON
AND WASH YOUR FACE IT'S ONLY THIS VERY MORNING I PLUNGED SOME FRESH GATHERED ROSES HEAD DOWNWARD IN THE WATER JUG
I DON'T KNOW I RECKON
YOU COULD PERHAPS HELP ME A LITTLE NO NOT HELP ME BUT IF YOU KNEW THE TRUTH PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ME TO RIGHTS THAT IS NOT IT AFTER ALL SAID SHE IN DESPAIR AT NOT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS HERSELF MORE EXACTLY AS SHE WISHED
FORMERLY SO DAINTILY TRIM THAT EVEN A STRAY ROSE LEAF SEEMED LIKE A FLECK ON ITS EXQUISITE ARRANGEMENT AND PROPRIETY WAS STREWED WITH CHILDREN'S THINGS A BAG OF MARBLES HERE A HOOP THERE
BUT IT WAS A TRUISM A PHANTOM AND BROKE DOWN UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HER REGRET SHE HAD TWENTY QUESTIONS ON THE TIP OF HER TONGUE TO ASK MISTER BELL BUT NOT ONE OF THEM DID SHE UTTER MISTER BELL THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS TIRED AND SENT HER EARLY TO HER ROOM
AFTERWARDS WE LOSE THE SENSE OF THE MYSTERIOUS I TAKE CHANGES IN ALL I SEE AS A MATTER OF COURSE THE INSTABILITY OF ALL HUMAN THINGS IS FAMILIAR TO ME TO YOU IT IS NEW AND OPPRESSIVE LET US GO ON TO SEE LITTLE SUSAN SAID MARGARET
BUT WE WILL NOT TALK OF THAT ANY MORE IF YOU PLEASE IT IS DONE MY SIN IS SINNED I HAVE NOW TO PUT IT BEHIND ME AND BE TRUTHFUL FOR EVERMORE IF I CAN VERY WELL IF YOU LIKE TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE AND MORBID BE SO
DRAWING HER COMPANION UP A GRASSY ROAD WAY LEADING UNDER THE SHADOW OF A FOREST GLADE WITH ALL MY HEART THOUGH I HAVE NOT AN IDEA WHO LITTLE SUSAN MAY BE BUT I HAVE A KINDNESS FOR ALL SUSANS FOR SIMPLE SUSAN'S SAKE
THE TAINTING BLOOD OF FALSEHOOD RUNS THROUGH US ALL I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED YOU AS FAR FROM IT AS MOST PEOPLE WHAT CRYING CHILD NAY NOW WE'LL NOT TALK OF IT IF IT ENDS IN THIS WAY I DARE SAY YOU HAVE BEEN SORRY FOR IT AND THAT YOU WON'T DO IT AGAIN
AND FELL OVER THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM NOT FAR NOT DEEP NOT ABOVE THREE FEET BUT OH MISTER BELL SOMEHOW THAT FALL KILLED HIM HOW AWKWARD IT WAS THIS LEONARDS I SUPPOSE AND HOW DID FRED GET OFF
HE WOULD KNOW NOTHING OF THIS RIOT ABOUT THE DRUNKEN FELLOW'S DEATH I SUPPOSE THE INQUIRY NEVER CAME TO ANYTHING NO THE PROCEEDINGS THEY HAD BEGUN TO TALK ABOUT ON THE INQUEST WERE STOPPED MISTER THORNTON DID KNOW ALL ABOUT IT HE WAS A MAGISTRATE
IN SOME HIDDEN RECESSES OF WHOSE LEAFY WEALTH HUNG THE GRIM ESCUTCHEON OF THE LENNARDS THE DOOR OF THE INN STOOD WIDE OPEN BUT THERE WAS NO HOSPITABLE HURRY TO RECEIVE THE TRAVELLERS WHEN THE LANDLADY DID APPEAR
TO TURN AND LOOK BACK WHEN THOU HEAREST THE SOUND OF MY NAME SHE KEPT CHOKING AND SWALLOWING ALL THE TIME THAT SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT SHE TRIED TO COMFORT HERSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT WHAT HE IMAGINED HER TO BE DID NOT ALTER THE FACT OF WHAT SHE WAS
AND AFTER THIS RUSTIC LUNCHEON THEY SET OUT TO WALK HARDLY KNOWING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO TURN SO MANY OLD FAMILIAR INDUCEMENTS WERE THERE IN EACH SHALL WE GO PAST THE VICARAGE ASKED MISTER BELL NO NOT YET
IT IS SO HOWEVER SAID MISTER BELL HE DIED QUITE SUDDENLY WHEN ON A VISIT TO ME AT OXFORD HE WAS A GOOD MAN MISSUS PURKIS AND THERE'S MANY OF US THAT MIGHT BE THANKFUL TO HAVE AS CALM AN END AS HIS COME MARGARET MY DEAR
AND THEY MIGHT HAVE ABSTRACTED MANY AN ARTICLE FIRST SHE GAVE THEM A KIND WELCOME ALMOST AS IF THEY HAD BEEN INVITED GUESTS AND APOLOGISED FOR HER COMING HAVING BEEN SO DELAYED
I ALWAYS KEEP MY CONSCIENCE AS TIGHT SHUT UP AS A JACK IN A BOX FOR WHEN IT JUMPS INTO EXISTENCE IT SURPRISES ME BY ITS SIZE SO I COAX IT DOWN AGAIN AS THE FISHERMAN COAXED THE GENIE
WAS WHEN SHE HAD LEFT IT WITH HER FATHER AND MOTHER THE DAY THE SEASON HAD BEEN GLOOMY AND SHE HERSELF HOPELESS BUT THEY WERE THERE WITH HER NOW SHE WAS ALONE AN ORPHAN
I AM IN THE MOOD IN WHICH WOMEN OF ANOTHER RELIGION TAKE THE VEIL I SEEK HEAVENLY STEADFASTNESS IN EARTHLY MONOTONY IF I WERE A ROMAN CATHOLIC AND COULD DEADEN MY HEART STUN IT WITH SOME GREAT BLOW I MIGHT BECOME A NUN
WHO TOLD US A DEAL OF MISTER HALE AND MISS MARGARET AND HE SAID MISSUS HALE WAS GONE POOR LADY BUT NEVER A WORD OF THE VICAR'S BEING AILING
WHICH HARMONISED WELL WITH HER PENSIVE THOUGHT MISTER BELL SLEPT SOUNDLY AFTER HIS UNUSUAL EXERCISE THROUGH THE DAY AT LAST HE WAS ROUSED BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE TEA TRAY BROUGHT IN BY A FLUSHED LOOKING COUNTRY GIRL
AND SEE THE THE WORD IMPROVEMENTS HAD HALF SLIPPED OUT OF HER MOUTH BUT SHE SUBSTITUTED THE MORE CAUTIOUS TERM ALTERATIONS WHICH THE PRESENT VICAR WAS MAKING
THE LADY HELD OUT A HAND TO MISTER BELL WITH
BUT SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE GONE OVER THESE DEAR LOVED WALKS IN SILENCE IF INDEED SHE WERE NOT UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO WISH THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALONE THEY REACHED THE COTTAGE WHERE SUSAN'S WIDOWED MOTHER LIVED SUSAN WAS NOT THERE
BECAME ALARMED BY THEIR NON APPEARANCE AND HER CONSEQUENT DREAD OF HER HUSBAND'S ANGER AND AS ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE SAVAGE COUNTRY SUPERSTITIONS THE CRIES OF A CAT IN THE AGONIES OF BEING BOILED OR ROASTED ALIVE COMPELLED AS IT WERE
NOW COMES THE BAD PART SAID SHE NERVOUSLY TWINING HER FINGERS TOGETHER A POLICE INSPECTOR CAME AND TAXED ME WITH HAVING BEEN THE COMPANION OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE PUSH OR BLOW HAD OCCASIONED LEONARDS DEATH
HALF FARM HOUSE HALF INN STANDING A LITTLE APART FROM THE ROAD AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT THE HOST DID NOT SO DEPEND ON THE CUSTOM OF TRAVELLERS AS TO HAVE TO COURT IT BY ANY OBTRUSIVENESS
AND IT'S LONG AGO NOW AND IN SHORT I WANT YOU TO BE VERY CHEERFUL AND NOT VERY SAD THIS EVENING MARGARET WIPED HER EYES AND TRIED TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE BUT SUDDENLY SHE BURST OUT AFRESH PLEASE MISTER BELL LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT IT
AND WHO HAD RECEIVED THE SOLEMN RITE OF BAPTISM FROM HER FATHER SHE SATE DOWN HALF LOSING HERSELF IN TRACING OUT THE CHANGING FEATURES OF THE GIRLS AND HOLDING SUSAN'S HAND FOR A MINUTE OR TWO UNOBSERVED BY ALL
WOULD YOU ONCE MORE COMPRESS YOURSELF INTO YOUR FORMER DIMENSIONS AND WHEN I'VE GOT HIM DOWN DON'T I CLAP THE SEAL ON THE VASE AND TAKE GOOD CARE HOW I OPEN IT AGAIN AND HOW I GO AGAINST SOLOMON WISEST OF MEN WHO CONFINED HIM THERE
SOME ONE CAME BY ON HORSEBACK IN THE ROAD JUST BELOW THE FIELD STYLE BY WHICH WE STOOD I SAW HIM LOOK AT ME BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHO IT WAS AT FIRST THE SUN WAS SO IN MY EYES BUT IN AN INSTANT THE DAZZLE WENT OFF AND I SAW IT WAS MISTER THORNTON AND WE BOWED
I AM SO TIRED SO TIRED OF BEING WHIRLED ON THROUGH ALL THESE PHASES OF MY LIFE IN WHICH NOTHING ABIDES BY ME NO CREATURE NO PLACE IT IS LIKE THE CIRCLE IN WHICH THE VICTIMS OF EARTHLY PASSION EDDY CONTINUALLY
EVERY MILE WAS REDOLENT OF ASSOCIATIONS WHICH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED FOR THE WORLD BUT EACH OF WHICH MADE HER CRY UPON THE DAYS THAT ARE NO MORE WITH INEFFABLE LONGING THE LAST TIME SHE HAD PASSED ALONG THIS ROAD
THE GRANDEUR AND REPOSE OF THE WORDS THE SAME YESTERDAY TO DAY AND FOR EVER EVERLASTING FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING THOU ART GOD THAT SKY ABOVE ME LOOKS AS THOUGH IT COULD NOT CHANGE AND YET IT WILL
MARGARET MISSED THEM EACH AND ALL AND GRIEVED OVER THEM LIKE OLD FRIENDS THEY CAME PAST THE SPOT WHERE SHE AND MISTER LENNOX HAD SKETCHED THE WHITE LIGHTNING SCARRED TRUNK OF THE VENERABLE BEECH AMONG WHOSE ROOTS THEY HAD SATE DOWN WAS THERE NO MORE
BUT HE MUST BE PERPLEXED IF THE AFFAIR HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE LEAST EXPLAINED THERE WAS FIRST YOUR WALKING OUT WITH A YOUNG MAN IN THE DARK BUT IT WAS MY BROTHER SAID MARGARET SURPRISED TRUE BUT HOW WAS HE TO KNOW THAT
BUT IT WAS NO SMILING MATTER TO MARGARET SHE HARDLY ATTENDED TO WHAT MISTER BELL WAS SAYING HER THOUGHTS RAN UPON THE IDEA BEFORE ENTERTAINED BUT WHICH NOW HAD ASSUMED THE STRENGTH OF A CONVICTION
STILL IT IS OPEN IF YOU WOULD LIKE IT OH NO SAID MARGARET LET US KEEP TO OUR PLAN LET US START AT TWELVE IT IS VERY GOOD AND KIND OF THEM BUT INDEED I COULD NOT GO VERY WELL DON'T FIDGET YOURSELF AND I'LL ARRANGE IT ALL
AND ONCE OR TWICE WHEN THE PARSONAGE HAS BEEN FULL I'VE SLEPT HERE AND TASTED YOUR GOOD ALE TO BE SURE I ASK YOUR PARDON BUT YOU SEE I WAS TAKEN UP WITH MISS HALE
TO QUIVER DOWN TO HER LIPS SHE WENT INTO THE PARLOUR AND GREETED MISTER BELL AH MISSY YOU WERE UP LATE LAST NIGHT AND SO YOU'RE LATE THIS MORNING NOW I'VE GOT A LITTLE PIECE OF NEWS FOR YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK OF AN INVITATION TO DINNER
NONE OF THE BUSTLE AND STIR THAT MARGARET HAD NOTICED IN HER TWO JOURNEYS ON THE LONDON AND NORTH WESTERN LINE LATER ON IN THE YEAR THIS LINE OF RAILWAY SHOULD BE STIRRING AND ALIVE WITH RICH PLEASURE SEEKERS
A MORNING CALL LITERALLY IN THE DEWY MORNING WHY I'VE HAD THE VICAR HERE ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO THE SCHOOL HOW MUCH THE DESIRE OF GIVING OUR HOSTESS A TEETOTAL LECTURE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE HAYMAKERS HAD TO DO WITH HIS EARLINESS I DON'T KNOW
AND IN MY BLINDNESS I FORGOT THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER WITNESS WHO COULD TESTIFY TO MY BEING THERE WHO MISTER THORNTON YOU KNOW HE HAD SEEN ME CLOSE TO THE STATION WE HAD BOWED TO EACH OTHER WELL
WE WILL GO THIS WAY AND MAKE A ROUND SO AS TO COME BACK BY IT REPLIED MARGARET HERE AND THERE OLD TREES HAD BEEN FELLED THE AUTUMN BEFORE OR A SQUATTER'S ROUGHLY BUILT AND DECAYING COTTAGE HAD DISAPPEARED
FIRST CLASS STAND UP FOR A PARSING LESSON WITH MISS HALE POOR MARGARET WHOSE VISIT WAS SENTIMENTAL NOT IN ANY DEGREE INSPECTIVE FELT HERSELF TAKEN IN BUT AS IN SOME WAY BRINGING HER IN CONTACT WITH LITTLE EAGER FACES ONCE WELL KNOWN
WHO HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN FINDING SOME VARIETY FROM HER USUAL OCCUPATION OF WAITER IN ASSISTING THIS DAY IN THE HAYFIELD
BUT WE ARE TAUGHT BY MISTER MILSOME TO CALL A AN WHO CAN REMEMBER AN ADJECTIVE ABSOLUTE SAID HALF A DOZEN VOICES AT ONCE
BY SAYING THAT IT WAS HAY TIME AND THE PROVISIONS FOR THE MEN HAD TO BE SENT A FIELD AND SHE HAD BEEN TOO BUSY PACKING UP THE BASKETS TO HEAR THE NOISE OF WHEELS OVER THE ROAD WHICH SINCE THEY HAD LEFT THE HIGHWAY RAN OVER SOFT SHORT TURF WHY
THE PARSONAGE WAS SO ALTERED BOTH INSIDE AND OUT THAT THE REAL PAIN WAS LESS THAN SHE HAD ANTICIPATED IT WAS NOT LIKE THE SAME PLACE THE GARDEN THE GRASS PLAT
WHENCE WE DROP LIKE FRUIT FULLY RIPE INTO THE QUIET MOTHER EARTH PLACES WERE CHANGED A TREE GONE HERE
AS IT HAD BEEN IN FORMER YEARS NATURE FELT NO CHANGE AND WAS EVER YOUNG MISTER BELL KNEW SOMETHING OF WHAT WOULD BE PASSING THROUGH HER MIND AND WISELY AND KINDLY HELD HIS TONGUE THEY DROVE UP TO THE LENNARD ARMS
YOU FORGOT YOURSELF IN THOUGHT FOR ANOTHER I HOPE I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME NO YOU WOULD NOT IT WAS WRONG DISOBEDIENT FAITHLESS AT THAT VERY TIME FRED WAS SAFELY OUT OF ENGLAND
THE CHILDREN KNEW MORE THAN SHE DID MISTER BELL TURNED AWAY AND SMILED MARGARET SPOKE NO MORE DURING THE LESSON BUT AFTER IT WAS OVER SHE WENT QUIETLY ROUND TO ONE OR TWO OLD FAVOURITES
AND I WAS UNDONE WITH ANXIETY AND AFRAID TOO THAT I MIGHT HAVE DRAWN HIM INTO DANGER AND WE HAD AN ALARM JUST AFTER HER DEATH FOR DIXON MET SOME ONE IN MILTON A MAN CALLED LEONARDS WHO HAD KNOWN FRED AND WHO SEEMED TO OWE HIM A GRUDGE
HE KNEW NOTHING OF FREDERICK TO PUT MYSELF TO RIGHTS IN HIS GOOD OPINION WAS I TO TELL HIM OF THE SECRETS OF OUR FAMILY INVOLVING AS THEY SEEMED TO DO THE CHANCES OF POOR FREDERICK'S ENTIRE EXCULPATION FRED'S LAST WORDS
FOR THAT AND ANY RETURN ON HER PART SHE HAD RESOLVED NEVER TO DWELL UPON AND SHE KEPT RIGIDLY TO HER RESOLUTION BUT IN THE RESPECT AND HIGH REGARD WHICH SHE HAD HOPED WOULD HAVE EVER MADE HIM WILLING IN THE SPIRIT OF GERALD GRIFFIN'S BEAUTIFUL LINES
AND WE WERE TOO EARLY AND WENT OUT TO WALK IN A FIELD JUST CLOSE BY I WAS ALWAYS IN A PANIC ABOUT THIS LEONARDS WHO WAS I KNEW SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
MARGARET WAS READY LONG BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME AND HAD LEISURE ENOUGH TO CRY A LITTLE QUIETLY WHEN UNOBSERVED AND TO SMILE BRIGHTLY WHEN ANY ONE LOOKED AT HER
THOUGH A TINGE OF SADNESS MIXED ITSELF WITH HER PLEASURE WHEN SCHOOL WAS OVER FOR THE DAY IT WAS YET EARLY IN THE SUMMER AFTERNOON
WELL TO BE SURE WE MUST ALL DIE ONLY THAT GENTLEMAN SAID HE WAS QUITE PICKING UP AFTER HIS TROUBLE ABOUT MISSUS HALE'S DEATH COME DOWN TO ME MISSUS PURKIS AFTER YOU HAVE ATTENDED TO MISS HALE I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH YOU ABOUT DINNER
BUT AS SHE RETURNED ACROSS THE COMMON THE PLACE WAS REINVESTED WITH THE OLD ENCHANTING ATMOSPHERE THE COMMON SOUNDS OF LIFE WERE MORE MUSICAL THERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD THE LIGHT MORE GOLDEN THE LIFE MORE TRANQUIL AND FULL OF DREAMY DELIGHT
THEY WERE BOTH OF THEM TIRED AND MARGARET HERSELF SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WAS UNWILLING TO GO OUT AS SHE HAD PROPOSED TO DO AND HAVE ANOTHER RAMBLE AMONG THE WOODS AND FIELDS SO CLOSE TO THE HOME OF HER CHILDHOOD
THE LITTLE CASEMENT WINDOW IN MARGARET'S BED CHAMBER WAS ALMOST FILLED UP WITH ROSE AND VINE BRANCHES BUT PUSHING THEM ASIDE AND STRETCHING A LITTLE OUT SHE COULD SEE THE TOPS OF THE PARSONAGE CHIMNEYS ABOVE THE TREES
THE OLD MAN THE INHABITANT OF THE RUINOUS COTTAGE WAS DEAD THE COTTAGE HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN AND A NEW ONE TIDY AND RESPECTABLE HAD BEEN BUILT IN ITS STEAD
BUT EVER WHEN TRUE FRIENDSHIP BINDS SPIRIT IT IS THAT SPIRIT FINDS IN SPIRIT THEN OUR BLISS WE FOUND IN SPIRIT YET TO THEM I'M BOUND
THERE ARE MANY THINGS MORE UNLIKELY I SHOULD SAY REPLIED MISTER BELL BUT I BELIEVE I NEVER SHALL STILL SOMEHOW ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO HAVE SUNK SO LOW IN IN A FRIEND'S OPINION AS I HAVE DONE IN HIS
WHERE SHE SATE LONG HOURS BY THE OPEN WINDOW GAZING OUT ON THE PURPLE DOME ABOVE WHERE THE STARS AROSE AND TWINKLED AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE GREAT UMBRAGEOUS TREES BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED ALL NIGHT LONG TOO THERE BURNT A LITTLE LIGHT ON EARTH
SUDDENLY LOOKING UP AT HIM WITH HER CLEAR HONEST EYES I TOLD A LIE AND HER FACE BECAME SCARLET TRUE THAT WAS BAD I OWN
TO THE DESTRUCTION OF A LONG BEAUTIFUL TENDER BRANCH LADEN WITH FLOWERS WHICH IN FORMER DAYS WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAINED UP TENDERLY AS IF BELOVED THE LITTLE SQUARE MATTED HALL WAS EQUALLY FILLED WITH SIGNS OF MERRY HEALTHY ROUGH CHILDHOOD AH SAID MISSUS HEPWORTH
YET STILL I SHOULD CHOOSE TO HAVE IT EXPLAINED IF ANY NATURAL OPPORTUNITY FOR EASY EXPLANATION OCCURS BUT IT IS NOT TO CLEAR MYSELF OF ANY SUSPICION OF IMPROPER CONDUCT THAT I WISH TO HAVE HIM TOLD
HE MIGHT BE SHOT ALL THIS FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND AND I SAID IT WAS NOT ME I WAS NOT AT THE RAILWAY STATION THAT NIGHT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT I HAD NO CONSCIENCE OR THOUGHT BUT TO SAVE FREDERICK I SAY IT WAS RIGHT I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
HOUSEHOLDS WERE CHANGED BY ABSENCE OR DEATH OR MARRIAGE OR THE NATURAL MUTATIONS BROUGHT BY DAYS AND MONTHS AND YEARS WHICH CARRY US ON IMPERCEPTIBLY FROM CHILDHOOD TO YOUTH
BUT AT THE END THE BEWILDERED WOMAN SIMPLY REPEATED HER FIRST ASSERTION NAMELY THAT IT WERE VERY CRUEL FOR SURE AND SHE SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO IT
WHO STRAGGLED TO THE TEMPTING BEER HOUSE UNOBSERVED AS THEY MIGHT HOPE BUT NOT UNOBSERVED IN REALITY FOR THE ACTIVE VICAR KEPT HIS EYE ON THE ROAD EVEN DURING THE COMPOSITION OF HIS MOST ORTHODOX SERMONS
A CANDLE IN HER OLD BEDROOM WHICH WAS THE NURSERY WITH THE PRESENT INHABITANTS OF THE PARSONAGE UNTIL THE NEW ONE WAS BUILT A SENSE OF CHANGE OF INDIVIDUAL NOTHINGNESS OF PERPLEXITY AND DISAPPOINTMENT OVER POWERED MARGARET
SHE HAD HEARD IT ALL HER LIFE BUT IT WERE VERY CRUEL FOR ALL THAT MARGARET GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND WALKED AWAY SICK AT HEART YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL NOT TO TRIUMPH OVER ME SAID MISTER BELL
IF THE WORLD STOOD STILL IT WOULD RETROGRADE AND BECOME CORRUPT IF THAT IS NOT IRISH LOOKING OUT OF MYSELF AND MY OWN PAINFUL SENSE OF CHANGE THE PROGRESS ALL AROUND ME IS RIGHT AND NECESSARY
DID YOU HAVE ANY EXPLANATION WITH HIM DID YOU EVER TELL HIM THE STRONG INSTINCTIVE MOTIVE THE INSTINCTIVE WANT OF FAITH AND CLUTCHING AT A SIN TO KEEP MYSELF FROM SINKING SAID SHE BITTERLY NO HOW COULD I
AND TELL HIM ALSO THAT I GAVE YOU LEAVE TO DO SO BECAUSE I FELT THAT FOR PAPA'S SAKE I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO LOSE HIS RESPECT THOUGH WE MAY NEVER BE LIKELY TO MEET AGAIN CERTAINLY I THINK HE OUGHT TO KNOW
AND THEN SHE WENT UP TO MARGARET AND SHOOK HER HANDS WITH MOTHERLY FONDNESS AND HOW ARE YOU ALL HOW'S THE VICAR AND MISS DIXON THE VICAR ABOVE ALL GOD BLESS HIM WE'VE NEVER CEASED TO BE SORRY THAT HE LEFT
MARGARET EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS NOT HER FATHER AND STAMMERED OUT THE FACT OF HIS DEATH WONDERING ALL THE TIME HOW MISTER HALE COULD HAVE BORNE COMING TO REVISIT HELSTONE IF IT HAD BEEN AS THE VICAR'S LADY SUPPOSED
AND WITH THIS NEW FRIGHT I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER HURRY OFF FRED TO LONDON WHERE AS YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT WE SAID THE OTHER NIGHT HE WAS TO GO TO CONSULT MISTER LENNOX AS TO HIS CHANCES IF HE STOOD THE TRIAL SO WE THAT IS HE AND I
AND HE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS NOT THE FALL THAT HAD CAUSED THE DEATH BUT NOT BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT I HAD SAID OH MISTER BELL SHE SUDDENLY COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AS IF WISHING TO HIDE HERSELF FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE RECOLLECTION
HOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN I OWN I AM WRONG ABOUT SCHOOLING ANYTHING RATHER THAN HAVE THAT CHILD BROUGHT UP IN SUCH PRACTICAL PAGANISM OH I REMEMBER POOR LITTLE SUSAN I MUST GO AND SEE HER WOULD YOU MIND CALLING AT THE SCHOOL
I AM CONTENT TO TAKE YOUR LIKING ME WITHOUT EXAMINING TOO CURIOUSLY INTO THE MATERIALS IT IS MADE OF ONLY WE NEED NOT WALK AT A SNAIL'S PACE VERY WELL WALK AT YOUR OWN PACE AND I WILL FOLLOW
AS MARGARET REMEMBERED HER FEELINGS YESTERDAY SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND I TOO CHANGE PERPETUALLY NOW THIS NOW THAT NOW DISAPPOINTED AND PEEVISH BECAUSE ALL IS NOT EXACTLY AS I HAD PICTURED IT
IF I THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SUSPECTED ME I SHOULD NOT CARE FOR HIS GOOD OPINION NO IT IS THAT HE MAY LEARN HOW I WAS TEMPTED AND HOW I FELL INTO THE SNARE WHY I TOLD THAT FALSEHOOD IN SHORT WHICH I DON'T BLAME
AND LEARNING TO READ A CHAPTER IN THE NEW TESTAMENT EVERY NIGHT BY HER SIDE THAN FROM ALL THE SCHOOLING UNDER THE SUN MARGARET DID NOT WANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO GO ON BY REPLYING TO HIM AND SO PROLONGING THE DISCUSSION BEFORE THE MOTHER
I DO NOT LIKE YOU TO REST EVEN UNDER THE SHADOW OF AN IMPROPRIETY HE WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF SEEING YOU ALONE WITH A YOUNG MAN AS FOR THAT SAID MARGARET RATHER HAUGHTILY
AND SAY THE ONE WORD PAPA SURELY SIR IT'S NEVER SO SAID MISSUS PURKIS TURNING TO MISTER BELL FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE SAD SUSPICION THAT NOW ENTERED HER MIND THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN HERE IN THE SPRING IT
AND HE SAW FREDERICK OF COURSE SAID MISTER BELL HELPING HER ON WITH HER STORY AS HE THOUGHT YES AND THEN AT THE STATION A MAN CAME UP TIPSY AND REELING AND HE TRIED TO COLLAR FRED AND OVER BALANCED HIMSELF AS FRED WRENCHED HIMSELF AWAY
MARGARET TRIED TO SPEAK AND TELL HER OF HER FATHER'S DEATH OF HER MOTHER'S IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MISSUS PURKIS WAS AWARE FROM HER OMISSION OF HER NAME BUT SHE CHOKED IN THE EFFORT AND COULD ONLY TOUCH HER DEEP MOURNING
AND THEY BOTH TALK SO MUCH AND BOTH AT A TIME THAT THEY KNOCK ONE DOWN AS IT WERE AND IT'S NOT TILL THEY'RE GONE AND ONE'S A LITTLE AT PEACE THAT ONE CAN THINK THAT THERE WERE THINGS ONE MIGHT HAVE SAID ON ONE'S OWN SIDE OF THE QUESTION
HE'LL BE AFTER THE MEN'S CANS IN THE HAY FIELD AND PEEPING IN AND THEN THERE'LL BE AN ADO BECAUSE IT'S NOT GINGER BEER BUT I CAN'T HELP IT MY MOTHER AND MY GRANDMOTHER BEFORE ME SENT GOOD MALT LIQUOR TO HAYMAKERS AND TOOK SALTS AND SENNA WHEN ANYTHING AILED THEM
SHE WAS GONE TO THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOL MARGARET WAS DISAPPOINTED AND THE POOR WOMAN SAW IT AND BEGAN TO MAKE A KIND OF APOLOGY
HER EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS BUT HER VOICE WAS STEADY AND MISTER BELL WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER AND NOW THAT FREDERICK HAS GIVEN UP ALL HOPE AND ALMOST ALL WISH OF EVER CLEARING HIMSELF AND RETURNING TO ENGLAND
BUT HERE HE WAS WHEN I CAME DOWN JUST BEFORE NINE AND WE ARE ASKED TO DINE THERE TO DAY BUT EDITH EXPECTS ME BACK I CANNOT GO SAID MARGARET THANKFUL TO HAVE SO GOOD AN EXCUSE
EFFULGENCE OF MY GLORIE
STAND ONELY AND BEHOLD GODS INDIGNATION ON THESE GODLESS POURD BY MEE NOT YOU BUT MEE THEY HAVE DESPIS'D YET ENVIED

AND I IN THEE FOR EVER AND IN MEE
AND TWENTIE THOUSAND I THIR NUMBER HEARD CHARIOTS OF GOD HALF ON EACH HAND WERE SEEN
IF YOU CAN BRING THEM TO ME BEFORE CHRISTMAS
SNATI SNATI HEARD THIS AND TOLD IT TO RING ADVISING HIM TO ASK THE KING FOR TWO AXES SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE ONE IN RESERVE IF THE FIRST ONE GOT BROKEN NEXT MORNING THE KING
BEING SOMETHING OF A SWIMMER HE AT LAST MADE UP HIS MIND TO KICK THE BOTTOM OUT OF THE BARREL
HE THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT TO HAVE SUCH A CHANCE OF WINNING THE KING'S DAUGHTER SNATI NOTICED THAT HIS MASTER WAS AT A LOSS AND SAID TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD NOT DISREGARD WHAT THE KING HAD ASKED HIM TO DO
AND CARRIED HIM HOME TO HIS HOUSE AND WAS EXCEEDINGLY KIND TO HIM HE GAVE HIM TO HIS WIFE
THE PRINCE WENT AWAY RATHER AFRAID THINKING WITH HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NO GREAT TREASURE AFTER ALL BUT ALL THE SAME WHAT IT HAD SAID TO HIM STUCK IN HIS MIND
TO KEEP THEM ALL THE WINTER TO WHICH HE AGREED WHEN THE KING'S MEN SAW THE DOG THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH AT IT AND MAKE AS IF THEY WOULD TEASE IT BUT WHEN THE PRINCE SAW THIS HE ADVISED THEM NOT TO DO IT
I THINK YOU MIGHT ASK HIM TO KILL THE WILD OXEN IN THE WOOD HERE AND FLAY THEM THE SAME DAY
SAID THE HAG I THINK YOU MAY JUST AS WELL DO THAT SAID HE SINCE YOU WON'T GRANT ME SUCH A LITTLE FAVOUR TAKE IT THEN YOU UTTER DISGRACE SAID THE OLD HAG
IN THE EVENING AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED THIS TASK THE PRINCE THOUGHT HIMSELF UNFIT TO CARRY ALL THE HORNS AND BOTH THE HIDES SO SNATI TOLD HIM TO LAY THEM ALL ON HIS BACK UNTIL THEY GOT TO THE PALACE GATE
UNTIL ALL THE HORSES BEGAN TO FOUNDER BENEATH THEM AT LAST THE PRINCE'S HORSE GAVE WAY TOO AND THEN THERE CAME OVER THEM A DARKNESS SO BLACK THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER SEE THE HIND
SPRANG UPON HIM TOOK THE CLOAK FROM HIM AND THREW HIM INTO THE RIVER THE OLD HAG COULD STAND THE THIRST NO LONGER AND ASKED HER HUSBAND TO GO FOR A DRINK FOR HER THE BRATS SHE SAID
NOW WE MUST GO IN AT ONCE SAID SNATI
THAT YOU FIND FOR ME MY GOLD CLOAK MY GOLD CHESS BOARD AND MY BRIGHT GOLD PIECE THAT WERE STOLEN FROM ME
WHICH PLEASED HIM SO MUCH THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES OFF IT
UNTIL THE KING GAVE IN TO HIM ONE DAY A MONTH OR SO BEFORE CHRISTMAS THE KING SPOKE TO RING SAYING THAT HE WISHED TO ASK A GREAT FAVOUR OF HIM
THEY WENT ON A LONG WAY UNTIL THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A HIND WITH A GOLD RING ON ITS HORNS THE PRINCE WAS EAGER TO CATCH IT IF POSSIBLE SO THEY GAVE CHASE AND RODE ON WITHOUT STOPPING
THE GIANT WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND SAID THERE YOU CHOSE MY OLD WOMAN'S RIGHT HAND BUT I MUST NOT BREAK MY WORD UPON THIS HE WENT TO GET THE DOG
SAID THE KING I DON'T KNOW RING NOW LEFT THE KING AND WAS VERY SILENT FOR HE SAW HE WAS IN A GREAT DIFFICULTY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
AS SOON AS THE FRIGHT BEGAN TO PASS OFF HE TRIED IT AGAIN FOR HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HEAR WHAT IT SAID BUT THINGS WENT JUST AS BEFORE WITH HIM HE THEN GOT
EVERY DAY ONE DAY THE GIANT TOOK HIM ROUND AND SHOWED HIM ALL HIS ROOMS EXCEPT THE PARLOUR
WHICH CAME RUNNING WITH SIGNS OF GREAT DELIGHT BUT THE PRINCE WAS SO MUCH AFRAID OF IT THAT IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM SHOWING HIS ALARM
AND THREW HIM INTO THE RIVER BEFORE THEY HAD GOT BACK AGAIN HOWEVER AND UP ON TOP OF THE CAVE
AND THEN SHOOK THE PRINCE WHO WAS LYING UNCONSCIOUS UNTIL HE WOKE UP THE BRIDEGROOM THEN
WHERE HE SAW A STONE BOAT WHICH WAS JUST BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD THE TWO OF THEM
YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH CURIOSITY SEEING YOU NEVER ASK MY NAME THE PRINCE THEN FORCED HIMSELF TO ASK WHAT IS YOUR NAME YOU HAD BEST CALL ME SNATI SNATI SAID THE DOG
AND LEFT THEM THERE THEN THEY HASTENED HOME TO THE KING WITH HIS THREE TREASURES WHERE THEY ARRIVED LATE ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT AND RING HANDED THEM OVER TO HIM THE KING
I WON'T GO SAID SHE UNLESS YOU LEND ME YOUR BRIGHT GOLD PIECE
SINCE YOU ARE JUST LIKE THESE TWO BRATS THE OLD TROLL NOW WENT OUT WITH THE GOLD CHESS BOARD AND DOWN TO THE RIVER AND WAS ABOUT TO TAKE A DRINK WHEN RING AND SNATI CAME UPON HIM TOOK THE CHESS BOARD FROM HIM
A LARGE PORRIDGE POT WAS HANGING NOW YOU MUST EMPTY ALL THE SALT INTO THE PORRIDGE POT SAID SNATI RING DID SO AND SOON THE TROLLS WAKENED UP
AFTER THE FEASTING WAS OVER THE TWO NAMESAKES ALONG WITH OTHER MEN WENT TO THE CLIFF AND BROUGHT ALL THE TREASURE HOME TO THE PALACE
SO SNATI WENT UP INTO THE PRINCE'S BED BUT AFTER A TIME HE CAME BACK AND TOLD RING HE COULD GO THERE HIMSELF NOW BUT TO TAKE CARE NOT TO MEDDLE WITH ANYTHING THAT WAS IN THE BED
DESTROY HIM ONE DAY A GOOD IDEA CAME INTO HIS HEAD HE CAME TO THE KING AND SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO HIM WHAT IS THAT SAID THE KING RED SAID
SO THAT YOU MIGHT NOT FREE ME FROM THE SPELL SHE WAS THE HIND THAT YOU AND YOUR COMPANIONS CHASED SHE WAS THE WOMAN THAT YOU FOUND IN THE CLEARING WITH THE BARREL AND THE OLD HAG THAT WE JUST NOW KILLED IN THE CAVE
BUT ONE DAY THE LATTER CAME TO HIM AND SAID HE WOULD NOW TAKE HIM OVER TO THE MAINLAND OUT OF THE ISLAND FOR HE HIMSELF HAD NO LONG TIME TO LIVE HE ALSO THANKED HIM FOR HIS GOOD SERVICE
BUT SOON EACH BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE KNEW THE RIGHT WAY BEST SO THEY SEPARATED AND ALL WENT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THE PRINCE TOO HAD GOT LOST LIKE THE REST
FOR THE ROCKS BY THE SEA WERE SMOOTH AND LEVEL BUT OVERHEAD THERE WERE HIGH CLIFFS IT SEEMED DIFFICULT TO GET UP THESE BUT HE WENT ALONG THE FOOT OF THEM FOR A LITTLE TILL AT LAST HE TRIED TO CLIMB UP WHICH AT LAST HE DID
THE PRINCE AGREED AND LAID EVERYTHING ON THE DOG EXCEPT THE SKIN OF THE SMALLER OX WHICH HE STAGGERED ALONG WITH HIMSELF AT THE PALACE GATE HE LEFT EVERYTHING LYING WENT BEFORE THE KING
SAID THE PRINCE WE CAN DO NOTHING ELSE SAID SNATI THAN ATTACK THEM
AND SAW LYING ON THE BED
SAYING THAT NOW HE COULD TAKE UP HIS QUARTERS THERE THEN SHE FIXED THE TOP ON THE BARREL AND THREW IT OUT INTO THE SEA THE PRINCE THOUGHT HIMSELF IN A BAD PLIGHT NOW
HE PUT ON THE CLOAK AND WHEN HE CAME OUTSIDE IT SHONE SO BRIGHT THAT HE COULD SEE TO GO WITH IT ON REACHING THE RIVER HE WENT TO TAKE A DRINK LIKE HIS SISTER BUT AT THAT MOMENT RING AND SNATI
WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY AND WAS ASTONISHED AT HOW CLEVER A MAN RING WAS IN ALL KINDS OF FEATS SO THAT HE ESTEEMED HIM STILL MORE HIGHLY THAN BEFORE AND BETROTHED HIS DAUGHTER TO HIM
OR THEY MIGHT HAVE THE WORST OF IT THEY REPLIED THAT THEY DIDN'T CARE A BIT WHAT HE THOUGHT
DIE THEN SAID THE SON
THAT HE HAD JUST REMEMBERED THE GOLD CLOAK GOLD CHESS BOARD AND BRIGHT GOLD PIECE THAT THE KING HAD LOST ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE DON'T REMIND ME OF THEM SAID THE KING RED HOWEVER
WHICH WAS COVERED WITH FOREST WITH APPLES GROWING AND ALTOGETHER PLEASANT AS FAR AS THE LAND WAS CONCERNED AFTER HE HAD BEEN THERE SEVERAL DAYS HE ONE DAY HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE FOREST WHICH MADE HIM TERRIBLY AFRAID
WHEN THE GIANT CAME ACROSS HIM HE STOOD STILL AND LOOKED AT THE PRINCE FOR A LITTLE
IF I HAD NOT DEFENDED MYSELF THE KING
RING SAID HE WAS WELCOME TO DO SO
AND ASKED HIM TO COME THAT LENGTH WITH HIM AND THERE HANDED OVER TO HIM THE HIDES AND HORNS OF THE OXEN THE KING WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT HIS VALOUR AND SAID HE KNEW NO ONE LIKE HIM AND THANKED HIM HEARTILY FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE
SHE IS THE WORST WITCH THAT EVER LIVED AND NO IRON CAN CUT HER ONE OF US MUST POUR BOILING PORRIDGE OUT OF THE POT ON HER AND THE OTHER PUNCH HER WITH RED HOT IRON IN THEY WENT THEN
SHE SAID THE PORRIDGE IS SALT I GOT THE MILK BY WITCHCRAFT YESTERDAY OUT OF FOUR KINGDOMS
AND TOLD HIM TO CHOOSE SOME ONE OF HIS POSSESSIONS
AND BY THE TIME SNATI CAME TO HELP HIM THE OX HAD NEARLY GOT HIM UNDER BUT SNATI WAS NOT SLOW IN HELPING HIS MASTER TO KILL IT EACH OF THEM THEN BEGAN TO FLAY THEIR OWN OX
BY THIS TIME THEY WERE FAR AWAY FROM ANY HOUSE AND THOUGHT IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MAKING THEIR WAY HOME AGAIN BUT THEY FOUND THEY HAD GOT LOST NOW
UP ON THE LOWEST SHELF OF THE ROCK THE PRINCE BEGAN TO GET GIDDY BUT UP WENT SNATI ON TO THE SECOND SHELF RING WAS NEARLY SWOONING BY THIS TIME BUT SNATI
AND REACHED THE TOP OF THE CLIFF WHERE THE PRINCE FELL DOWN IN A FAINT AFTER A LITTLE HOWEVER HE RECOVERED AGAIN AND THEY WENT A SHORT DISTANCE ALONG A LEVEL PLAIN UNTIL THEY CAME
SO THAT HE RAN TO HIDE HIMSELF AMONG THE TREES THEN HE SAW A GIANT APPROACHING DRAGGING A SLEDGE LOADED WITH WOOD AND MAKING STRAIGHT FOR HIM SO THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING FOR IT
HAD GOT DOWN OFF THE ROOF AND THRUST HER HEAD FIRST INTO THE RIVER THE OLD HAG BEGAN NOW TO LONG FOR THE WATER AND SAID THAT THE GIRL WOULD BE RUNNING ABOUT WITH THE GOLD PIECE ALL OVER THE PLAIN
SAID THE HAG DIE THEN SAID THE GIRL
THEN THEY BURNED THE OLD TROLL AND HER TO ASHES AND EXPLORED THE CAVE WHERE THEY FOUND PLENTY OF GOLD AND TREASURES THE MOST VALUABLE OF THESE THEY CARRIED WITH THEM AS FAR AS THE CLIFF
AND HELD HIM TO BE A GREAT HERO NOR COULD RED ANY LONGER SAY ANYTHING AGAINST HIM
UNLESS A PRINCE OF THE SAME NAME AS HIMSELF ALLOWED HIM TO SLEEP AT HIS FEET THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER HIS MARRIAGE HE ADDED FURTHER AS SOON
HAD JUST TOLD RING WHAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT AND IN REPLY HE ASKED THE KING
SNATI IMMEDIATELY SPRANG UPON HIM AND RING ASSISTED IN THE ATTACK AND AFTER A HARD STRUGGLE THEY MASTERED HIM A SECOND TIME WHEN THEY GOT BACK AGAIN
WHAT IS THAT SAID RING
HIS DAUGHTER THE KING REPLIED THAT HE THOUGHT IT ALTOGETHER UNBECOMING TO PROPOSE SUCH A THING TO RING
WAS MORE THAN TWICE AS BIG I SUSPECTED SAID THE KING THAT RING WAS NOT QUITE USELESS
AND SUMMONING UP ALL HIS COURAGE TRIED IT
HIS INTENDED SON IN LAW WAS FOR HE HAD DONE THIS TO HIM WITHOUT ANY CAUSE WHATEVER THE KING BECAME VERY ANGRY AND SAID HE WOULD SOON FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT IT AND IF RING HAD CUT OFF HIS HAND
HE MIGHT TAKE POSSESSION OF ALL THAT WAS IN THE ISLAND AFTER HE AND HIS WIFE DIED WHICH WOULD HAPPEN WITHIN TWO WEEKS FROM THAT TIME THE PRINCE THANKED HIM
AND SHE COULD HAVE IT TO HELP HER IN THE HOUSE THE OLD WOMAN WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND BEGAN TO FONDLE THE PRINCE WITH THE UTMOST DELIGHT HE STAYED THERE WITH THEM AND WAS VERY WILLING AND OBEDIENT TO THEM IN EVERYTHING
BUT AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED IT THE OLD HAG GREW SO THIRSTY THAT SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND ASKED HER DAUGHTER TO GO OUT AND BRING HER SOME WATER FROM THE RIVER THAT RAN NEAR BY
AND OPENED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM AND STOOD FIRM THEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS A BIG DOG WHICH SPOKE TO HIM AND SAID CHOOSE ME PRINCE RING
AND AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED EATING AND DRINKING IN THE HALL WENT OFF TO SLEEP IN HIS OWN ROOM SNATI HOWEVER ASKED PERMISSION TO SLEEP IN THE PRINCE'S BED
SO SHE ASKED HER SON TO GO AND GET HER A DROP OF WATER I WON'T GO SAID HE UNLESS I GET THE GOLD CLOAK
AND THE GIANT RETURNED HOME WHILE RING WENT UP SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SEA BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT LAND HE HAD COME TO AND WAS AFRAID TO SPEAK TO THE DOG
HIS OWN LIFE AND THAT RED WAS WELL WORTHY OF DEATH SO RED WAS HANGED AND RING MARRIED THE KING'S DAUGHTER
RING WAS NOW IN FAR GREATER ESTEEM WITH THE KING THAN BEFORE AND RED WAS ALL THE MORE DISCONTENTED ONE DAY HE CAME TO THE KING AND SAID IF RING IS SUCH A MIGHTY MAN
RING WAS QUITE READY AND WENT OFF AT ONCE TO THE GREAT DELIGHT OF RED WHO WAS NOW SURE OF HIS DEATH
SNATI SAID TO HIM NOW YOU MUST FIRST OF ALL GO ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND GATHER AS MUCH SALT AS EVER YOU CAN THE PRINCE DID SO AND GATHERED SO MUCH SALT
AND I SHALL TAKE THE OTHER WITH THIS SNATI LEAPT AT THE BIG ONE
OTHERWISE HE WOULD GET INTO GREAT DIFFICULTIES THE PRINCE ASSENTED TO THIS AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY AFTER HE HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF THE KING AND WAS SETTING OUT ON THE SEARCH
THIS HAND SAID RING CAME OVER THE PARTITION DURING THE NIGHT
THEY CAME BELLOWING TO MEET HIM ONE OF THEM WAS TREMENDOUSLY BIG THE OTHER RATHER LESS RING GREW TERRIBLY AFRAID HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM ASKED SNATI NOT WELL AT ALL
HE SHOULD BE HANGED BUT IF IT WAS OTHERWISE THEN RED SHOULD DIE SO THE KING SENT FOR RING AND ASKED HIM FOR WHAT REASON HE HAD DONE THIS SNATI HOWEVER
HE HAD LOST HIS MOTHER AND IN HER PLACE HIS FATHER HAD MARRIED A WITCH WHO HAD LAID A SPELL ON HIM THAT HE SHOULD TURN INTO A DOG AND NEVER BE RELEASED FROM THE SPELL
ANYTHING THE KING REPLIED THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHORT TIME SINCE HE HAD COME THERE RED THEN ASKED HIM TO SEND THEM BOTH TO CUT DOWN WOOD NEXT MORNING AND SEE WHICH OF THEM COULD DO MOST WORK
THINKING THERE MUST BE SOME VERY RARE TREASURE THERE SO ONE DAY WHEN THE GIANT HAD GONE INTO THE FOREST HE TRIED TO GET INTO THE PARLOUR AND MANAGED TO GET THE DOOR OPEN HALF WAY THEN
WENT ON TO SAY THAT SINCE RING WAS SUCH A MIGHTY MAN THAT HE COULD DO EVERYTHING IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM TO ADVISE THE KING TO ASK HIM TO SEARCH FOR THESE TREASURES
TO GET IT FOR WHICH THE PRINCE THANKED HER AND SAID IT WAS AT LEAST WORTH TRYING SO HE LEANED OVER INTO THE BARREL WHICH DID NOT SEEM VERY DEEP AND THOUGHT HE WOULD EASILY REACH THE RING
AS HE FELT THE BARREL FLOATING OUT FROM THE LAND
RING THANKED HIM HEARTILY AND SAID THERE WAS NO NEED TO PAY HIM FOR HIS SERVICES THEY WERE SO LITTLE WORTH
WE MUST GO UP HERE SAID SNATI I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE CHILD'S PLAY SAID THE PRINCE HOLD FAST BY MY TAIL SAID SNATI
ON REACHING THE MAINLAND THE GIANT TOOK A FRIENDLY FAREWELL OF RING
AND SAW AN UGLY DOG'S SKIN LYING NEAR HIM AND A BEAUTIFUL PRINCE IN THE BED
AND ONE DAY ASKED RING TO GO AND KILL THE OXEN THAT WERE IN THE WOOD FOR HIM AND BRING THEIR HORNS AND HIDES TO HIM IN THE EVENING
AND WANDERED ON FOR A TIME UNTIL HE CAME TO A LITTLE CLEARING IN THE FOREST NOT FAR FROM THE SEA WHERE HE SAW A WOMAN SITTING ON A CHAIR AND A BIG BARREL STANDING BESIDE HER
SO YOU HAVE COME PRINCE RING YOU MUST HAVE SEEN TO MY HUSBAND AND CHILDREN SNATI SAW THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO ATTACK THEM AND SPRANG AT HER WITH A RED HOT IRON FROM THE FIRE WHILE RING
NOW WE ARE COMING TO A KING'S SEAT AND YOU MUST ASK THE KING TO KEEP US ALL WINTER AND TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE ROOM FOR BOTH OF US
AS SOON AS SHE CAME TO THE RIVER SHE LAY DOWN TO TAKE A DRINK OF THE WATER
TO A CAVE THIS WAS ON CHRISTMAS EVE THEY WENT UP ABOVE THE CAVE AND FOUND A WINDOW IN IT THROUGH WHICH THEY LOOKED AND SAW FOUR TROLLS LYING ASLEEP BESIDE THE FIRE OVER WHICH
KEPT POURING BOILING PORRIDGE ON HER WITHOUT STOPPING
HE SAW THAT SOME LIVING CREATURE MOVED INSIDE AND RAN ALONG THE FLOOR TOWARDS HIM AND SAID SOMETHING WHICH MADE HIM SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE SPRANG BACK FROM THE DOOR AND SHUT IT AGAIN
BUT AT LAST HE FELT THAT THE BARREL WAS KNOCKING AGAINST ROCKS AT WHICH HE WAS A LITTLE CHEERED THINKING IT WAS PROBABLY LAND AND NOT MERELY A
THE PRINCE WENT UP TO HER AND SALUTED HER POLITELY AND SHE RECEIVED HIM VERY GRACIOUSLY HE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE BARREL THEN AND SAW LYING AT THE BOTTOM AN UNUSUALLY BEAUTIFUL GOLD RING
AND BOTH AGREED RING GOT THE TWO AXES AND EACH WENT HIS OWN WAY BUT WHEN THE PRINCE HAD GOT OUT INTO THE WOOD SNATI TOOK ONE OF THE AXES AND BEGAN TO HEW ALONG WITH HIM
WERE OF COURSE RUNNING ABOUT AND PLAYING THEMSELVES JUST AS SHE HAD EXPECTED THEY WOULD LITTLE WRETCHES THAT THEY WERE I WON'T GO SAID THE OLD TROLL UNLESS YOU LEND ME THE GOLD CHESS BOARD
THAT HE COULD HARDLY CARRY IT BUT SNATI SAID THROW IT ON MY BACK WHICH HE ACCORDINGLY DID AND THE DOG THEN RAN ON BEFORE THE PRINCE UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF A STEEP CLIFF
HE WAS AT THAT TIME A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE THEORY OF PERSONAL MAGNETISM A DELUSION FROM WHICH HE AFTERWARD ESCAPED ON THE OCCASION WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE OPERATOR COMMANDED HIM TO CLOSE HIS EYES
I CAN HYPNOTIZE MYSELF TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I WILL BECOME WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF EVENTS TAKING PLACE AROUND ME AND A LONG INTERVAL OF TIME SAY FROM ONE HALF TO TWO HOURS WILL BE A COMPLETE BLANK
SOON BECAME REAL TO HIM AND HE FOUND HIMSELF TAKING PART IN A WILD CHASE NOT AS WITCH DEVIL OR TAM EVEN BUT IN SOME WAY HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WAS SPREAD THROUGH EVERY PART OF THE SCENE BEING OF IT
AND TAKING HIM INTO THE CENTER OF THE STAGE SHOWED HIM A SMALL RIDING WHIP HE LOOKED AT IT INDIFFERENTLY ENOUGH HE WAS TOLD IT WAS A HOT BAR OF IRON BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STILL INCREDULOUS
THIS IS AN INSTANCE OF WHAT IS CALLED POST HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION DOCTOR COCKE TELLS OF SUGGESTING TO A DRINKER WHOM HE WAS TRYING TO CURE OF THE HABIT THAT FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS ANYTHING HE TOOK WOULD MAKE HIM VOMIT
BUT I WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE TWO CONTRADICTORY ELEMENTS WITHIN ME I KNEW THAT MY BODY EXISTED BUT COULD NOT PROVE IT TO MYSELF I KNEW THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE OPERATOR WERE IN A MEASURE UNTRUE
AND CLAIRVOYANCE IF THE POWERS OF THE MIND ARE SO ENORMOUSLY INCREASED ALL THAT IS REQUIRED OF A VERY SENSITIVE AND EASILY HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS TO HYPNOTIZE HIM OR HERSELF WHEN HE WILL BE ABLE TO READ THOUGHTS
ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
HIS EYES ASSUMED THE SAME EXPRESSION THAT HAD BEEN NOTICED IN HIS COMPANION'S HE TOO AROSE IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AS IF HIS HEAD WERE PULLING THE BODY ALONG AND FOLLOWING THE FINGER IN THE SAME WAY AS HIS PREDECESSOR
IS THAT OF THE MYSTIC SWEDENBORG WHO SAW SUCH STRANGE THINGS IN HIS VISIONS AND AT LAST CAME TO BELIEVE IN THEM AS REAL THE SAME EXPLANATION MAY BE GIVEN OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ORIENTAL PROPHETS
HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE COULD TELL WHO THE FATHER WAS BY THE SIMILARITY AND THE COLOR OF THE EYES THESE SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE IN A LOUD TONE MISS FLINT BEING NO NEARER ONE SUBJECT THAN ANOTHER
IT BECAME SLOW AND IRREGULAR AND VERY SMALL THE RESPIRATION DECREASED ALMOST TO GASPING THE FACE GREW PALE AND A COLD PERSPIRATION BROKE OUT READERS WHO ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT
THE OPERATOR WENT ON PRICKING THE ARM WITH A PIN AND THOUGH DOCTOR COCKE FELT THE PAIN HE SAID HE DID NOT FEEL IT AND AT THE SAME TIME THE SENSATION OF TERROR INCREASED I WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF MY BODY AT ALL HE SAYS FURTHER ON
FOR INSTANCE THE EFFECTS OF AN EXCITING RELIGIOUS REVIVAL ARE VERY LIKE THOSE PRODUCED BY MESMER'S OPERATIONS IN PARIS THE SUBJECTS BECOME HYSTERICAL AND ARE READY TO BELIEVE ANYTHING OR DO ANYTHING
JUST AS HE WAS RETURNING IT TO HIS POCKET THE LADY SUDDENLY POINTED A FINGER AT HIM
THE FEELING OF NOT WISHING TO OPEN MY EYES WAS NOT BASED UPON ANY DESIRE TO PLEASE THE OPERATOR I HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIM IN ANY WAY BUT BE IT UNDERSTOOD I FIRMLY BELIEVED IN HIS POWER TO CONTROL ME
THEIR IMPERSONATIONS ARE RIDICULOUS IN THE EXTREME ONE MAN I REMEMBER BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLES SUMNER BEING UNEDUCATED HE USED THE MOST WRETCHED ENGLISH
COURTING A BROOMSTICK THE SIDE SHOW LET US NOW DESCRIBE SOME OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF HYPNOTISM TO SEE JUST HOW IT OPERATES AND HOW IT EXHIBITS ITSELF
AT THE SAME TIME INTO THE AUDIENCE THE ONE WHO WAS IMPERSONATING A NEWSBOY WENT ABOUT CRYING HIS EDITION IN A LOUD VOICE WHILE THE HUNTER CRAWLED ALONG STEALTHILY AND CAREFULLY
HE POINTED TO A SUPPOSITIOUS CANVAS PICTURE HE CHAFFED THE BOYS HE FLATTERED THE VANITY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS WITH THEIR GIRLS TELLING THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT AFFORD FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS TO MISS THIS GREAT SHOW
HE SHOWS HIS INCONSISTENCY WHEN HE STATES THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE HYPNOTIZER IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING HYPNOTIZED HIMSELF IN THIS HE MAKES NO CLAIM THAT THE SUBJECT IS USING ANY PSYCHIC POWER
I FELT IN A VAGUE WAY THAT THERE WERE BEINGS ALL ABOUT ME BUT COULD NOT HEAR THEIR VOICES I FELT AS THOUGH EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY WAS FIXED AND RIGID
SHE TOUCHED EACH ONE OF THE CLASS IN SUCCESSION AND EVERY ONE MANIFESTED THE UTMOST PAIN AND FEAR ONE SUBJECT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED IN DIRE DISTRESS
WILL FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN THE SAME ARTICLE DOCTOR COCKE DESCRIBES A PECULIAR TRICK HE PLAYED UPON THE SIGHT OF A SUBJECT SAYS HE I ONCE HYPNOTIZED A MAN
LET US QUOTE DOCTOR COCKE'S EXPERIMENT IN HYPNOTIZING HIMSELF IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT A PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTIZER OR MAGNETIZER HAD HYPNOTIZED HIM BY TELLING HIM TO FIX HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND
ANOTHER WAS GIVEN A BROOMSTICK AND TOLD TO HUNT GAME IN THE WOODS BEFORE HIM ANOTHER WAS GIVEN A LARGE RAG DOLL AND TOLD THAT IT WAS AN INFANT AND THAT HE MUST LOOK AMONG THE AUDIENCE AND DISCOVER THE FATHER
AND IT IS TRUE THAT A PERSON CAN DELIBERATELY HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF WHEN HE WISHES TO TILL HE HAS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IT AND IS EXPERT IN IT SO TO SPEAK IT DOES AWAY AT A STROKE WITH THE CLAIMS OF ALL PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTISTS AND MAGNETIC HEALERS
AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO PRODUCE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR THE PULSE WAS LOWERED LATER IT ROSE TO A RATE DOUBLE THE NORMAL AND THE TENSION WAS DIMINISHED THE IMPRESSION DESCRIBED BY THE SUBJECT AFTERWARD
THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN AND TWIRLED THEM FASTER AND FASTER IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO STOP ONE OF THE SUBJECTS SAID HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE STRANGE ACTION OF HIS HANDS AND SOMETIMES IT PUZZLED HIM TO KNOW WHY THEY WHIRLED
PROBABLY NO SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON WAS EVER SO GROSSLY PROSTITUTED TO BASE ENDS AS THAT OF HYPNOTISM LATER WE SHALL SEE SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS FORMS THIS CHARLATANISM ASSUMES
SECONDLY I WISHED TO BE HYPNOTIZED THESE TOGETHER WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION AND STRAINED ATTENTION BROUGHT ON THE STATES WHICH OCCURRED
THE NEWSBOY EVEN ADOPTED THE WELL WORN DEVICE OF ASKING THOSE WHOM HE SOLICITED TO BUY TO HELP HIM GET RID OF HIS STOCK ONE MAN OFFERED HIM A CENT WHEN THE PRICE WAS TWO CENTS THE NEWSBOY CHAFFED THE WOULD BE PURCHASER
GAZING STEADILY AT A BED OF BRIGHT COALS OR A STREAM OF RUNNING WATER WILL INVARIABLY THROW A SENSITIVE SUBJECT INTO A HYPNOTIC SLEEP THAT WILL LAST SOMETIMES FOR SEVERAL HOURS DOCTOR COCKE SAYS
BUT HE DID OPEN THEM AT ONCE AGAIN HE TOLD HIM TO CLOSE THE EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME HE GENTLY STROKED HIS HEAD AND FACE AND EYELIDS WITH HIS HAND DOCTOR COCKE FANCIED HE FELT A TINGLING SENSATION IN HIS FOREHEAD AND EYES
THEN HE STOPPED MISS FLINT LED HIM TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE AND LEFT HIM STANDING IN PROFOUND SLUMBER HE STOOD THERE STOOPING EYES SET AND VACANT FAST ASLEEP
THAT YOU CAN'T PULL THEM APART THEY ARE FAST YOU CANNOT PULL THEM APART TRY YOU CAN'T THE WHOLE CLASS MADE FRANTIC EFFORTS TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS BUT WERE UNABLE TO DO SO THE DOCTOR'S EXPLANATION OF THIS IS
IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC UPON HYPNOTIC SUBJECTS WHILE IN VIENNA HE TOOK OCCASION TO OBSERVE CLOSELY THE ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICAL DEVOTEES AS THEY SAT IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF WAGNER'S OPERAS
ARE CAUSES WHICH ARE OFTEN FOUND IN CONJUNCTION AND PRODUCE EFFECTS WHICH WE MAY REASONABLY EXPLAIN ON THE THEORY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION
HE LOOKED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN DASHED DOWN THE PLATFORM INTO THE AUDIENCE AND SEIZING THE MAN'S HEAD VIGOROUSLY RUBBED IT AS THIS DID NOT EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND PUT THE FIRE OUT IN DOING THIS HE SET HIS COAT ON FIRE
ONE YOUNG FELLOW AGED ABOUT EIGHTEEN SAID THAT HE WAS ADDICTED TO THE CIGARETTE HABIT THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE ENTERTAINMENT HE WAS ASKED TO SMOKE AS WAS HIS USUAL HABIT
I WAS INTENSELY COLD MY HEART SEEMED TO STAND STILL I HAD RINGING IN MY EARS MY HAIR SEEMED TO RISE UPON MY SCALP I PERSISTED IN THE EFFORT AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NOISE IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER
HOW THE SUBJECT FEELS UNDER HYPNOTIZATION DOCTOR COOPER'S EXPERIENCE EFFECT OF MUSIC DOCTOR ALFRED MARTHIEU'S EXPERIMENTS
THEN HE CALMLY RESUMED HIS GARMENT AND WALKED BACK TO THE STAGE THE SIDE SHOW CLOSED THE EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT A YOUNG MAN WAS TOLD TO THINK OF HIMSELF AS MANAGING A SIDE SHOW AT A CIRCUS
THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
BUT THE MOMENT THE GESTURE WAS MADE HIS COUNTENANCE FELL HIS MIRTH STOPPED WHILE THAT OF HIS COMPANIONS REDOUBLED AND THE CHANGE WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT THE AUDIENCE SHARED IN THE LAUGHTER BUT THE SUBJECT NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD
AT EACH INDIVIDUAL AWOKE HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WHEN QUESTIONED AFTERWARD AS TO WHAT SENSATION HE EXPERIENCED AT THE SNAPPING OF THE FINGERS REPLIED THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF SOMETHING INSIDE OF HIS HEAD RESPONDED
HIS DESCRIPTIONS OF DREAMS BEAR A WONDERFUL LIKENESS TO DE QUINCEY'S DREAMS SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE ENGLISH MAIL COACH DE PROFUNDIS AND THE CONFESSIONS OF AN ENGLISH OPIUM EATER
AND HIS LANGUAGE WAS UTTERLY DEVOID OF SENSE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND A VERY INTELLIGENT LADY WHO BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN PERSONATED THE PART VERY WELL DOCTOR COOKE SAYS OF HIMSELF
THAT FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS THEY COULD SEE MORE WONDERS THAN EVER BEFORE HAD BEEN CROWDED UNDER ONE CANVAS TENT HE HARANGUED THE CROWD AS THEY SURGED ABOUT THE TENT DOOR
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE HYPNOTIST COMMANDED ME TO AWAKE AS SOON AS I DROPPED MY ARM AND YET TEN MINUTES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS HAD PASSED ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION DOCTOR COCKE WHO WAS BLIND WAS PUT INTO A DEEP HYPNOTIC SLEEP
THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS HYPNOTIZING THE WHOLE CLASS THROUGH THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL AS SHE SPOKE SHE LIGHTLY TOUCHED THE SUBJECT WITH THE END OF THE WHIP THE MOMENT THE SUBJECT FELT THE WHIP HE JUMPED AND SHRIEKED AS IF IT REALLY WERE A HOT IRON
THOUGH HE IS LOCKED UP IN A SEPARATE ROOM HE CAN MAKE THE PSYCHIC POWER WORK THROUGH THE WALLS ALL THAT HE DOES IS TO PUT HIS SUBJECTS IN THE WAY OF HYPNOTIZING THEMSELVES
THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTED TO HIM AN INTERESTING SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS HIS FIRST SUBJECT WAS EASILY HYPNOTIZED AND OF AN EMOTIONAL NATURE WAGNER'S
THAT THEY HAVE ANY PECULIAR POWER IN THEMSELVES WHICH THEY EXERT OVER THEIR FELLOWS ONE OF THESE PROFESSIONALS GIVES AN ACCOUNT IN HIS BOOK OF WHAT HE CALLS THE WONDERFUL LOCK METHOD HE SAYS THAT
ALL OF WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY DUE TO OPIUM THE CAUSES WHICH DOCTOR COCKE THINKS PRODUCED THE HYPNOTIC CONDITION IN HIS CASE NAMELY BELIEF DESIRE TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND STRAINED ATTENTION UNITED WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION
HYPNOTISM IS AN ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC FACT BUT THE CLAIM THAT THE HYPNOTIZER HAS ANY MYSTERIOUS PSYCHIC POWER IS THE INVARIABLE MARK OF THE CHARLATAN
APPEARS TO SUMMON SIGMUND TO VALHALLA
AS THE MUSIC PROGRESSED THE TENSION DIMINISHED THE RESPIRATION INCREASED FROM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY PER MINUTE GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE SUBJECT WAS EVIDENT HIS WHOLE BODY WAS THROWN INTO MOTION HIS LEGS WERE DRAWN UP HIS ARMS TOSSED INTO THE AIR
THE ROAR IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER STILL AND I HEARD ABOVE THE ROAR REPORTS WHICH SOUNDED LIKE ARTILLERY AND MUSKETRY THEN ABOVE THE DIN OF THE NOISE A MUSICAL CHORD I SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN THIS CHORD I KNEW NOTHING ELSE
BY FIXING HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND THIS TIME HE EXPERIENCED A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF TERROR AND INCIDENTALLY LEARNED THAT HE COULD HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF THE MATTER OF SELF HYPNOTISM
TRIED TO CROSS THE ALPS IN WINTER AND IN THEIR STRUGGLES WERE ALL LOST OR SOLD INTO SLAVERY WITHOUT EVEN REACHING THE HOLY LAND AGAIN HYPNOTISM IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE POET'S DREAMS
AND POSSIBLY THESE TWO THINGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE MUCH THE SAME IN FACT ON NO OTHER GROUND CAN WE EXPLAIN THE SO CALLED CHILDREN'S CRUSADE IN WHICH OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM GERMANY FROM ALL CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY
HE THEN MADE PASSES OVER MY HEAD DOWN OVER MY HANDS AND BODY BUT DID NOT TOUCH ME HE THEN SAID TO ME YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES THE MOTOR APPARATUS OF MY LIDS WOULD NOT SEEMINGLY RESPOND TO MY WILL
AT THIS POINT DOCTOR FLINT'S DAUGHTER TOOK CHARGE OF THE CLASS SHE POINTED HER FINGER AT ONE OF THEM AND THE SUBJECT BEGAN TO LOOK STEADILY BEFORE HIM AT WHICH THE REST OF THE CLASS WERE HIGHLY AMUSED
THE ROAR BECAME DEAFENING IT CRACKLED LIKE A MIGHTY FIRE I WAS FEARFULLY CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF HAVING READ VIVID ACCOUNTS OF DREAMS VISIONS ET CETERA IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WOULD EXPERIENCE THEM
FOR IN THE ORIENT HYPNOTISM IS MUCH EASIER AND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED THAN WITH US OF THE WEST THE PERFORMANCES OF THE DERVISHES AND ALSO OF THE FAKIRS WHO WOUND THEMSELVES AND PERFORM MANY WONDERFUL FEATS
WHILE A FEW WERE WIDE AWAKE AND SMILING AT THE REST THESE LATTER WERE DISMISSED AS UNLIKELY SUBJECTS WHEN THE STAGE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT RESPONSIVE THE DOCTOR PASSED AROUND AND SNAPPING HIS FINGER
AND WITH THIS SENSATION HE REGAINED SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS TO BE DOUBTED AS A RULE SUBJECTS IN THIS STAGE OF HYPNOTISM DO NOT FEEL ANY SENSATION THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER
THE SUGGESTION WAS REPEATED AND AS THE GLAZED LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES THE INCREDULOUS LOOK DIED OUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE CLASS WAS FOLLOWING THE SUGGESTION MADE TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME EXPRESSION IN THEIR EYES THE DOCTOR SAID
PRESENTLY THE SUBJECT'S HEAD LEANED FORWARD THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES DILATED AND ASSUMED A PECULIAR GLASSY STARE HE AROSE WITH A STEADY GLIDING GAIT
WHO WERE SEATED ON THE STAGE IN A SEMICIRCLE FACING THE AUDIENCE AND STROKING EACH ONE'S HEAD AND FOREHEAD REPEATING THE PHRASES CLOSE YOUR EYES THINK OF NOTHING BUT SLEEP YOU ARE VERY TIRED YOU ARE DROWSY
ARE NO DOUBT THE EFFECT OF HYPNOTIZATION BY THE PRIESTS SOME OF THE STRANGE MOVEMENTS OF WHOLE COMMUNITIES DURING THE CRUSADES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED EITHER ON THE THEORY OF HYPNOTIZATION OR OF CONTAGION
YET I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT WHILE ONE PART OF MY MIND WANTED TO OPEN MY EYES ANOTHER PART DID NOT WANT TO SO I WAS IN A PARADOXICAL STATE I BELIEVED THAT I COULD OPEN MY EYES AND YET COULD NOT
THE OPERATOR SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SLEEP YOU ARE GETTING SLEEPY YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MY HEART WAS BEATING RAPIDLY AND I FELT A SENSATION OF TERROR
IN RESPONSE TO A CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS TWENTY YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED MEN CAME UPON THE STAGE THEY EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMENCED BY DOCTOR FLINT PASSING AROUND THE GROUP
AND THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE A LANDSCAPE OF LOFTY GRANDEUR A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC WAS PLAYED
THE MANNER IN WHICH LITTLE BY LITTLE HE VENTURED UPON A FAMILIAR FOOTING WAS EXCEEDINGLY FUNNY BUT WHEN IN A MOMENT OF CONFIDENT RESPONSE TO HIS WOOING HE CLASPED HER ROUND THE WAIST AND IMPRINTED A CHASTE KISS UPON THE BRUSHY PART OF THE BROOM
AND TOLD THAT IT WAS HIS SWEETHEART HE ACCEPTED THE SITUATION AND SAT DOWN BY THE BROOM HE WAS A LITTLE SHEEPISH AT FIRST BUT EVENTUALLY HE GREW BOLDER AND SMILED UPON HER SUCH A SMILE AS MALVOLIO CASTS UPON OLIVIA
HE WAS THEN AWAY FROM ANY ONE WHO COULD INFLUENCE HIM HE REPLIED THAT THE VERY IDEA WAS REPUGNANT HOWEVER HE WAS INDUCED TO TAKE A CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH BUT IT MADE HIM ILL AND HE FLUNG IT AWAY WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF DISGUST
BY PROLONGING THE OPERATION A WHOLE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE OR LESS HYPNOTIZED IN ALL SUCH CASES HOWEVER UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IS COMMONLY FOLLOWED BY UNUSUAL LETHARGY
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ACCOUNTS EVER GIVEN IS THAT OF DOCTOR JAMES R COCKE A HYPNOTIST HIMSELF WHO SUBMITTED TO BEING OPERATED UPON BY A PROFESSIONAL MAGNETIZER
THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE GIVEN BY DOCTOR HERBERT L FLINT A VERY SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC OPERATOR IT IS IN THE LANGUAGE OF AN EYE WITNESS A NEW YORK LAWYER
THEN HE STROKED THE ARM AND SAID IT WAS GROWING NUMB HE SAID YOU HAVE NO FEELING IN IT HAVE YOU DOCTOR COCKE GOES ON I SAID NO AND I KNEW THAT I SAID NO
TO HIM IT ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE PICTURED WILD RIDE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF WOTAN THE SUBJECT TAKING PART IN THE RIDE IT WAS NOTICEABLE IN EACH CASE THAT THE SAME MUSIC PLAYED TO THEM IN THE WAKING STATE PRODUCED NO SPECIAL IMPRESSION
WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
THIS SUBJECT DID NOT PASS INTO SUCH A DEEP STATE OF HYPNOTISM BUT THE RESULT WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME THE PULSE RATE ROSE FROM SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THE SENSATION REMEMBERED WAS THAT OF RIDING FURIOUSLY THROUGH THE AIR
BUT THE EMBODIMENT OF A DRAMA IN WHICH THEY BECAME SO WRAPPED UP THAT THEY FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE MECHANICAL AND EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THE MUSIC AND LIVED COMPLETELY IN A FAIRY WORLD OF DREAM
YOU FEEL VERY SLEEPY AS HE DID THIS SEVERAL OF THE VOLUNTEERS CLOSED THEIR EYES AT ONCE AND ONE FELL ASLEEP IMMEDIATELY ONE OR TWO REMAINED AWAKE
WITH ITS LOFTY DOME OR THE FACES OF IMAGINARY BEINGS BEAUTIFUL OR DEMONIACAL ACCORDING TO THE WILL AND TEMPER OF THE SUBJECT PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SELF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE HAVE IN HISTORY
HAD THE SUGGESTION BEEN CONTINUED IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE RAISED A BLISTER ONE OF THE AMUSING EXPERIMENTS TRIED AT A LATER TIME WAS THAT OF A TALL YOUNG MAN DIFFIDENT PALE AND MODEST BEING GIVEN A BROOM CAREFULLY WRAPPED IN A SHEET
THAT WHAT THEY WERE REALLY DOING WAS TO FORCE THEIR HANDS CLOSER TOGETHER THUS OBEYING THE COUNTER SUGGESTION THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS WAS EVIDENT FROM THEIR ENDEAVORS
I OBEYED THEM VOLUNTARILY AND INVOLUNTARILY THIS IS THE LAST REMEMBRANCE THAT I HAVE OF THAT HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCE AFTER THIS HOWEVER THE OPERATOR CAUSED THE DOCTOR TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH HE LEARNED OF FROM HIS FRIENDS AFTER THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER
AND YET PLAYING THE PART OF SPECTATOR AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN DREAMS DOCTOR WARTHIN TRIED THE SAME EXPERIMENT AGAIN THIS TIME ON A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS NOT SO EMOTIONAL AND WAS HYPNOTIZED WITH MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY
IN FACT IT IS A SORT OF INTOXICATION THE SAME PHENOMENA ARE PROBABLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE STRANGE RECORDS OF HISTORY THE WONDERFUL CURES AT LOURDES OF WHICH WE HAVE READ IN ZOLA'S NOVEL OF THAT NAME
NAMELY THAT OF THE CLAIRVOYANT AND MEDIUM WE MAY CONCEIVE HOW SUCH A PROFESSION MIGHT BECOME PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE AND HIGHLY USEFUL BUT AT PRESENT IT SEEMS AS IF ANY PERSON WHO WENT INTO IT
THE STATE OF MIND BROUGHT UP BEFORE HIM IN THE MOST REALISTIC AND VIVID MANNER POSSIBLE THE PICTURE OF THE RIDE OF TAM O'SHANTER WHICH HE HAD SEEN YEARS BEFORE THE PICTURE
IN THE MEANTIME THE ACT HAD CAUSED GREAT LAUGHTER AMONG THE REST OF THE CLASS ONE YOUNG FELLOW IN PARTICULAR LAUGHED SO UPROARIOUSLY THAT TEARS COURSED DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO WIPE HIS EYES
BUT OF COURSE IF THE HYPNOTIZER LOOKS STEADILY INTO THE EYES OF HIS SUBJECT AND THE SUBJECT LOOKS INTO HIS EYES THE STEADY GAZE ON A BRIGHT OBJECT WILL PRODUCE HYPNOTISM IN ONE QUITE AS READILY AS IN THE OTHER
DISGUISED BY THE SHEET THE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH ROARS OF LAUGHTER THE SUBJECT HOWEVER WAS DEAF TO ALL OF THE NOISE HE WAS ABSORBED IN HIS COURTSHIP AND HE CONTINUED TO HUG THE BROOM AND EXHIBIT IN HIS FEATURES
AND CALL THE LETTERS AS I DIRECTED STIMULATION WAS IN THIS CASE IMPOSSIBLE AS I MADE HIM READ FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PAGES HE CALLING THE LETTERS AS SUGGESTED EACH TIME THEY OCCURRED THE EXTRAORDINARY HEIGHTENING
WHEN HIS MIND HAD ABSORBED THIS IDEA HE WAS ORDERED TO OPEN HIS EXHIBITION HE AT ONCE MOUNTED A TABLE AND IN THE VOICE OF THE TRADITIONAL SIDE SHOW FAKIR BEGAN TO DILATE UPON THE FAT WOMAN AND THE SNAKES
THE BARE SUGGESTION WAS GIVEN AS NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE A NEWSBOY AND ARE SELLING PAPERS OR NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE HUNTING AND ARE GOING INTO THE WOODS TO SHOOT BIRDS SO THE PARTY WAS STARTED
WHICH HE SUPPOSED CAME FROM THE HAND OF THE OPERATOR AFTERWARD HE CAME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS SENSATION WAS PURELY IMAGINARY ON HIS PART THEN HE SAYS A SENSATION AKIN TO FEAR CAME OVER ME
THAT HE HAS EXPERIMENTED IN THIS DIRECTION WITH PATIENTS OF HIS SAYS HE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESIST THE STATE OR TO BRING IT AT WILL MANY OF THEM DESCRIBE BEAUTIFUL SCENES FROM NATURE OR SOME MIGHTY CATHEDRAL
MOREOVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION CAREFULLY CONCEALED AND CALLED BY ANOTHER NAME OPENS ANOTHER GREAT FIELD OF HUMBUG AND CHARLATANISM OF WHICH THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPERS ARE CONSTANTLY FILLED
WE SHALL CONSIDER IN ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THIS CONNECTION WE FIND GREAT INTEREST IN AN ARTICLE IN THE MEDICAL NEWS JULY TWENTY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
HOWEVER HONEST HE MIGHT BE AT THE START SOON BEGAN TO DECEIVE HIMSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS UNTIL HE LOST HIS POWER ENTIRELY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACT AND IMAGINATION BEFORE DISCUSSING THE MATTER FURTHER
THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED ON OTHER SUBJECTS IN ALL CASES WITH THE SAME RESULT
HE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN A CONDITION OF SELF INDUCED HYPNOTISM IN WHICH THEIR SUBJECTIVE FACULTIES WERE SO EXALTED AS TO SUPERSEDE THEIR OBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS MUSIC WAS NO LONGER TO THEM A SUCCESSION OF PLEASING SOUNDS
THEY WERE EXTREMELY NOURISHING AND PLEASANT TO THE TASTE THANKS TO EFFICIENT PACKING THEY KEPT FRESH AND CRISP ALL THE TIME THESE BISCUITS FORMED A GREAT PART OF OUR DAILY DIET AND UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED IN NO SMALL DEGREE TO THE SUCCESSFUL RESULT
THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
ON THE VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH ROENNE SEWED NEW FLOORS OF GOOD STRONG CANVAS TO THE FIVE NEW TENTS ALL CASES OF PROVISIONS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR WINTER QUARTERS WERE MARKED AND STOWED SEPARATELY IN THE HOLD
THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THIS WITH OUR TENTS THEY WERE UP IN A TWINKLING AND STOOD AGAINST ALL KINDS OF WIND WE COULD LIE SECURELY IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS AND LET IT BLOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DOOR WAS ON THE USUAL SACK PRINCIPLE
FOR THE FEET ARE THE MOST EXPOSED MEMBERS AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO PROTECT ONE CAN LOOK AFTER THE HANDS
AND WAS IN MY OPINION EXCELLENT IT ALSO KEPT GOOD THE WHOLE TIME THE CHOCOLATE CAME FROM A WORLD RENOWNED FIRM AND WAS BEYOND ALL PRAISE THE WHOLE SUPPLY WAS A VERY ACCEPTABLE GIFT
AND THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST WAY OF UTILIZING THE POWER I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO ADOPT THE SAME SYSTEM IN SLEDGING ON THE BARRIER ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IT HAD WAS THAT THE DOGS WOULD PASS SINGLY ACROSS FISSURES
BUT IT OCCASIONALLY HAPPENS THAT SENSATION IS LOST AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE TAKEN AND THEN ONE MUST BE AN OLD HAND TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED MANY MEN CONCLUDE THAT AS THEY NO LONGER FEEL THE UNPLEASANT SMARTING SENSATION ALL IS WELL
WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY A CHILD'S FOOT WITH TWO PAIRS OF REINDEER SKIN STOCKINGS ON AND TEN PAIRS WERE MADE
BUT WERE UNFORTUNATELY OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP ON THE MAIN SOUTHERN JOURNEY WE WERE SO MANY IN A TENT AND SPACE WAS SO LIMITED THAT I DARED NOT RISK USING IT IF ONE HAS ROOM ENOUGH IT IS IDEAL IN MY OPINION
FOR THE COVERING OF THE ROOF WE TOOK OUT ROOFING PAPER AND FOR THE FLOOR LINOLEUM IN THE MAIN ROOM THERE WERE TWO AIR PIPES
WE HAD SIX THREE MAN TENTS ALL MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS THE WORKMANSHIP COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER THEY WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST PRACTICAL TENTS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN USED THEY WERE MADE OF THE CLOSEST CANVAS WITH THE FLOOR IN ONE PIECE
THE MEDICAL STORES FOR SLEDGING WERE GIVEN BY A LONDON FIRM AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE THINGS WERE PACKED SPEAKS FOR THE WHOLE OUTFIT THERE IS NOT A SPECK OF RUST ON NEEDLES SCISSORS KNIVES OR ANYTHING ELSE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MUCH DAMP
THE LINING OF COURSE WAS TORN IN PLACES BUT THE SEAMS OF THE MITS WERE JUST AS PERFECT AS THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT I WENT ON SKI THE WHOLE WAY AND USED TWO POLES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MITS WERE STRONGLY MADE
ONE MAN WAS SUFFICIENT TO SET UP THE TENT IN THE STIFFEST BREEZE I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FEWER POLES A TENT HAS THE EASIER IT IS TO SET UP WHICH SEEMS QUITE NATURAL THESE TENTS HAVE ONLY ONE POLE
OR GAVE US ALL MORE WORK IN THE COURSE OF THE EXPEDITION THAN THE STIFF OUTER COVERING WHICH WE HAD TO HAVE BUT WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM AT LAST I APPLIED TO ONE OF THE LEADING MAKERS OF SKI BOOTS IN CHRISTIANIA AND EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTY TO HIM
THE FOOT CAN MOVE FAR MORE EASILY AND KEEP WARM BUT WE WERE TO TAKE SKI AND TO GET FULL USE OUT OF THEM SO THAT IN ANY CASE WE HAD TO HAVE A STIFF SOLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE BINDINGS IT IS OF NO USE TO HAVE A GOOD BINDING UNLESS YOU CAN USE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY
ALL THE SETS OF HARNESS WERE MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS AND AFTER THEIR LONG AND HARD USE THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THERE COULD BE NO BETTER RECOMMENDATION THAN THIS OF INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS FOR THE SLEDGE JOURNEYS WE CARRIED TWO SEXTANTS
IT GIVES A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT USES LITTLE OIL AND REQUIRES NO ATTENTION ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH ANYWHERE BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN SLEDGING THERE IS NEVER ANY TROUBLE WITH THIS APPARATUS IT HAS COME AS NEAR PERFECTION AS POSSIBLE
I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF THE PEMMICAN I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A WHOLE GROCER'S SHOP WITH ME WHEN SLEDGING THE FOOD SHOULD BE SIMPLE AND NOURISHING AND THAT IS ENOUGH A RICH AND VARIED MENU IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO WORK TO DO
TWO ANEROIDS WITH ALTITUDE SCALE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET AND TWO HYPSOMETERS THE HYPSOMETER IS ONLY AN INSTRUMENT FOR DETERMINING THE BOILING POINT WHICH GIVES ONE THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA THE METHOD IS BOTH SIMPLE AND RELIABLE
FOR IF THEY HAD KNOWN IT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE LET IT GO SO FAR THE FACT IS THAT IN THIS CASE SENSATION IS A SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL GUIDE FOR THE FEET LOSE ALL SENSATION
IT WAS BUILT BY THE BROTHERS HANS AND JOERGEN STUBBERUD AND WAS THROUGHOUT A SPLENDID PIECE OF WORK WHICH DID HONOUR TO BOTH THE BROTHERS THE MATERIALS PROVED EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY THE HUT WAS TWENTY SIX FEET LONG BY THIRTEEN FEET WIDE
AND THIS IS A SUFFICIENTLY TROUBLESOME PIECE OF WORK TO MAKE ONE DISINCLINED TO UNDO IT AGAIN UNTIL ONE IS TURNING IN THEY CANNOT BE SEEN IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND ONE HAS TO DEPEND ENTIRELY ON FEELING BUT FEELING IN THIS CASE OFTEN PLAYS CURIOUS TRICKS
I CHOSE THEM OF THIS LENGTH WITH A VIEW TO BEING ABLE TO CROSS THE NUMEROUS CRACKS IN THE GLACIERS THE GREATER THE SURFACE OVER WHICH THE WEIGHT COULD BE DISTRIBUTED THE BETTER PROSPECT WE SHOULD HAVE OF SLIPPING OVER THE SNOW BRIDGES
I WANT THE SKI TO BE A PART OF ONESELF SO THAT ONE ALWAYS HAS FULL COMMAND OF THEM I HAVE TRIED MANY PATENTS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID OF A STIFF FASTENING IN COLD TEMPERATURES BUT ALL THESE PATENTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE WORTHLESS IN THE LONG RUN
THE STEEL SHOEING OF THE RUNNERS WAS WELL COATED WITH RED LEAD AND THE SPARE RUNNERS WITH TAR THESE SLEDGES WERE EXTREMELY STRONGLY BUILT AND COULD STAND ALL KINDS OF WORK ON EVERY SORT OF SURFACE AT THAT TIME
I NEVER WENT THAT WAY AGAIN UNTIL I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EXHIBITION WAS CLOSED ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT THE BOOTS WERE A FINE PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WE SHALL HEAR LATER ON OF THE ALTERATIONS THEY HAD TO UNDERGO BEFORE WE AT LAST MADE THEM AS LARGE AS WE WANTED
ITS HEIGHT FROM THE FLOOR TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET IT WAS BUILT AS AN ORDINARY NORWEGIAN HOUSE WITH POINTED GABLE AND HAD TWO ROOMS ONE OF THESE WAS NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO SERVE AS OUR DORMITORY DINING ROOM AND SITTING ROOM
AND SNOW GOGGLES FROM DOCTOR SCHANZ
HOW OFTEN ONE READS IN NARRATIVES OF POLAR TRAVEL THAT IT TOOK SUCH AND SUCH A TIME OFTEN HOURS TO SET UP THE TENT AND THEN WHEN AT LAST IT WAS UP ONE LAY EXPECTING IT TO BE BLOWN DOWN AT ANY MOMENT
THEY WERE SERVED OUT TO US FROM THE NAVAL STORES THE OTHER FIVE WERE NEW AND WE BOUGHT THEM FROM THE ARMY DEPOTS IT WAS OUR INTENTION TO USE THE TENTS AS TEMPORARY HOUSES THEY WERE EASILY AND QUICKLY SET UP AND WERE STRONG AND WARM
FORTUNATELY I HAD FOUND A MAN WHO WAS EVIDENTLY INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION WE AGREED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A SAMPLE PAIR AFTER THE PATTERN OF SKI BOOTS THE SOLE WAS TO BE THICK AND STIFF FOR WE HAD TO BE PREPARED TO USE CRAMPONS BUT THE UPPERS AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE
WHICH IS SLIPPED OVER THE ANIMAL'S HEAD AND MAKES THE WEIGHT OF THE PULL COME ON HIS SHOULDERS WHEREAS THE GREENLAND HARNESS PRESSES ON HIS CHEST RAW PLACES WHICH OCCUR RATHER FREQUENTLY WITH THE GREENLAND HARNESS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY AVOIDED WITH THE OTHER
TO CARRY ONE'S CAUTION TO LENGTHS WHICH MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS NOW IT IS A FACT THAT IF ONE CAN WEAR SOFT FOOT GEAR EXCLUSIVELY THE RISK OF FROST BITE IS FAR LESS THAN IF ONE IS COMPELLED TO WEAR STIFF BOOTS IN SOFT FOOT GEAR OF COURSE
AS OF COURSE THE COLD PENETRATES MORE EASILY THROUGH THE THIN SKIN AND GIVES RISE TO DAMPNESS IN THE FORM OF RIME ON MEETING THE WARMTH OF THE BODY THESE THIN PATCHES REMAIN DAMP WHENEVER ONE IS IN THE BAG AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY LOSE THEIR HAIR
WE TOOK FIVE NANSEN COOKERS WITH US THIS COOKER UTILIZES THE HEAT MORE COMPLETELY THAN ANY OTHER BUT I HAVE ONE OBJECTION TO MAKE TO IT IT TAKES UP SPACE WE USED IT ON OUR DEPOT JOURNEYS
THE DAMP SPREADS LIKE DECAY IN WOOD AND CONTINUALLY ATTACKS THE SURROUNDING SKIN WITH THE RESULT THAT ONE FINE DAY YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH A HAIRLESS SLEEPING BAG
THE OTHER PARTS WERE OF GOOD TOUGH NORWEGIAN ASH TO EACH SLEDGE BELONGED A PAIR OF SPARE RUNNERS WHICH COULD EASILY BE FITTED UNDERNEATH BY MEANS OF CLAMPS AND AS EASILY REMOVED WHEN NOT REQUIRED
THREE ARTIFICIAL HORIZONS OF WHICH TWO WERE GLASS HORIZONS WITH DARK GLASSES AND ONE A MERCURY HORIZON AND FOUR SPIRIT COMPASSES MADE IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE EXCELLENT LITTLE COMPASSES
LET ME TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING THIS MAN FOR THE MANY AND GREAT SERVICES HE HAS RENDERED ME NOT ONLY DURING MY PREPARATIONS FOR THE THIRD VOYAGE OF THE FRAM
THEY HAD ONLY A LITTLE ROUND OPENING ON THE TOP CLOSED WITH AN ALUMINIUM LID WHICH FITTED EXACTLY LIKE THE LID OF A MILK CAN LARGE LIDS WEAKEN THE CASES AND I HAD THEREFORE CHOSEN THIS FORM WE DID NOT HAVE TO THROW OFF THE LASHING OF THE CASE TO GET THE LID OFF
IN ORDER TO AVOID LEATHER WHICH USUALLY BECOMES STIFF AND EASILY CRACKED IN THE COLD HE WAS TO USE A COMBINATION OF LEATHER AND THIN CANVAS FOR THE UPPERS LEATHER NEAREST THE SOLE AND CANVAS ABOVE IT THE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN FROM MY FOOT
WITH HIS HELP I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THINGS THAT I SHOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET HE SHRANK FROM NO AMOUNT OF WORK BUT WENT ON TILL HE HAD FOUND WHAT I WANTED
IT WILL PERHAPS BE SUGGESTED THAT I AM LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS AILMENT THAN OTHERS BUT I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD SEVERAL SEVERE ATTACKS OF SNOW BLINDNESS WE HAD TWO PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERAS AN AIR THERMOMETER
THE HANDIER ONE'S SLEDGING OUTFIT THE SOONER ONE GETS INTO THE TENT AND TO REST AND THAT IS NO SMALL CONSIDERATION ON A LONG JOURNEY OUR OUTFIT OF CLOTHING WAS ABUNDANT AND MORE COMPLETE I SUPPOSE THAN THAT OF ANY FORMER POLAR EXPEDITION
AND AT THE EVENING INSPECTION A FROZEN FOOT OF TALLOW LIKE APPEARANCE PRESENTS ITSELF AN EVENT OF THIS KIND MAY RUIN THE MOST ELABORATELY PREPARED ENTERPRISE AND IT IS THEREFORE ADVISABLE IN THE MATTER OF FEET
HOW EXCELLENT THESE GLASSES ARE APPEARS CLEARLY ENOUGH FROM THE FACT THAT I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF SNOW BLINDNESS ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
SO FAR I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OUR GENERAL OUTFIT AND SHALL NOW PASS TO THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT OF THE SHORE PARTY THE HUT WE TOOK OUT WAS BUILT ON MY PROPERTY ON BUNDEFJORD SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE WORK AS IT PROGRESSED
WE THEN WENT TO WORK TO MAKE CLOTHES AFTER THE PATTERN OF THE NETCHELLI ESKIMO AND THE SEWING WENT ON EARLY AND LATE THICK ANORAKS AND THIN ONES HEAVY BREECHES AND LIGHT WINTER STOCKINGS AND SUMMER STOCKINGS
THE HUT WAS TARRED SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERY PART WAS CAREFULLY MARKED SO THAT IT COULD EASILY BE SET UP TO FASTEN IT TO THE GROUND AND PREVENT THE ANTARCTIC STORMS FROM BLOWING IT AWAY I HAD STRONG EYEBOLTS SCREWED INTO EACH END OF THE ROOF RIDGE
FOR THE GIANT BOOTS TURNED OUT MUCH TOO SMALL AMONG OTHER EQUIPMENT I MUST MENTION OUR EXCELLENT PRIMUS COOKING APPARATUS THIS ALL CAME COMPLETE FROM A FIRM IN STOCKHOLM FOR COOKING ON SLEDGE JOURNEYS THE PRIMUS STOVE RANKS ABOVE ALL OTHERS
OUR BURBERRY WIND CLOTHES WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF ANORAK BLOUSE AND TROUSERS BOTH VERY ROOMY THE OTHERS CONSISTED OF TROUSERS AND JACKET WITH HOOD OUR MITS WERE FOR THE MOST PART SUCH AS ONE CAN BUY IN ANY SHOP
SO THAT THE DANGER OF FALLING THROUGH WAS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED THE EXERTION OF PULLING IS ALSO LESS TRYING WITH ALASKA HARNESS THAN WITH THE GREENLAND KIND AS THE ALASKA HARNESS HAS A SHALLOW PADDED COLLAR
IF ONE IS TIRED AND SLACK IT MAY SOMETIMES HAPPEN THAT ONE WILL PUT OFF TILL TO MORROW WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE TO DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS BITTERLY COLD
AND THEY WERE SO EXCELLENT BOTH IN MATERIAL AND MAKING UP THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IT WAS A MODEL PIECE OF WORK TO SAVE THIS OUTER SLEEPING BAG WE HAD IT PROVIDED WITH A COVER OF THE LIGHTEST CANVAS
THIS TIME HE PROCURED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOOD REINDEER SKINS DRESSED BY THE LAPPS AND SENT THEM TO CHRISTIANIA HERE I HAD GREAT TROUBLE IN FINDING A MAN WHO COULD SEW SKINS BUT AT LAST I FOUND ONE
BESIDES THESE WE HAD TEN PAIRS OF ORDINARY KID MITS WHICH WERE BOUGHT AT A GLOVE SHOP IN CHRISTIANIA AND WERE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAR OUT I WORE MINE FROM FRAMHEIM TO THE POLE AND BACK AGAIN AND AFTERWARDS ON THE VOYAGE TO TASMANIA
WHICH COULD BE STRETCHED OVER THE ROOF IF THE GALES WERE TOO SEVERE THE TWO VENTILATING PIPES AND THE CHIMNEY WERE SECURED OUTSIDE WITH STRONG STAYS AS WILL BE SEEN EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO MAKE THE HUT WARM AND COMFORTABLE
WHICH CAME FROM THE ESTATE OF PALSGAARD IN JUTLAND AND THE MATERIAL DID ALL IT PROMISED THESE CASES WERE ONE FOOT SQUARE AND FIFTEEN AND A HALF INCHES HIGH
WE HAD FORTY SKI POLES WITH EBONITE POINTS THE SKI BINDINGS WERE A COMBINATION OF THE HUITFELDT AND THE HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS WE ALSO HAD QUANTITIES OF LOOSE STRAPS
AND TO HOLD IT DOWN ON THE GROUND WE ALSO TOOK ON BOARD A QUANTITY OF LOOSE TIMBER BOARDS AND PLANKS BESIDES THE HUT WE TOOK WITH US FIFTEEN TENTS FOR SIXTEEN MEN EACH TEN OF THESE WERE OLD BUT GOOD
FOR INSULATION WE USED CELLULOSE PULP THE FLOOR AND THE CEILING BETWEEN THE ROOMS AND THE LOFT WERE DOUBLE
FIRST THE REINDEER SKINS HAD TO BE BOUGHT IN A RAW STATE
WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF WOOLLEN GLOVES WHICH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE OTHERS GREATLY PRIZED FOR MYSELF I WAS NEVER ABLE TO WEAR SUCH THINGS THEY SIMPLY FREEZE THE FINGERS OFF ME BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS THE COVERING OF THE FEET
AND THIS IS A VERY GREAT ADVANTAGE WE COULD ALWAYS GET AT IT A CASE WITH A LARGE LID COVERED BY THE LASHING GIVES CONSTANT TROUBLE THE WHOLE LASHING HAS TO BE UNDONE FOR EVERY LITTLE THING ONE WANTS OUT OF THE CASE THIS IS NOT ALWAYS CONVENIENT
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GRAPPLE WITH ANY DEGREE OF COLD WE WERE SUPPLIED WITH THE RICHEST ASSORTMENT OF REINDEER SKIN CLOTHING WE HAD IT SPECIALLY THICK MEDIUM AND QUITE LIGHT IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THESE SKIN CLOTHES PREPARED
IN MY OPINION ON A LONG JOURNEY SUCH AS THAT WE HAD BEFORE US THE SKI MUST BE PERFECTLY STEADY I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING THAT TIRES ME MORE THAN A BAD FASTENING THAT IS ONE THAT ALLOWS THE FOOT TO SHIFT IN THE BINDING
MILK POWDER IS A COMPARATIVELY NEW COMMODITY WITH US BUT IT DESERVES TO BE BETTER KNOWN IT CAME FROM THE DISTRICT OF JAEDEREN NEITHER HEAT NOR COLD DRYNESS NOR WET COULD HURT IT
DURING THE WHOLE STAY ON THE BARRIER I MYSELF WORE A PAIR OF ORDINARY SPECTACLES WITH YELLOW GLASSES OF QUITE A LIGHT TINT
OUR OWN MEDICAL OUTFIT WHICH WAS BOUGHT IN CHRISTIANIA AND ACCORDING TO THE VENDOR'S STATEMENT UNUSUALLY WELL PACKED BECAME IN A SHORT TIME SO DAMAGED THAT THE WHOLE OF IT IS NOW ENTIRELY SPOILT THE SLEDGING PROVISIONS MUST BE MENTIONED BRIEFLY
THEY WERE EXHIBITED IN THE BOOTMAKER'S WINDOWS I USED TO GO A LONG WAY ROUND TO AVOID COMING FACE TO FACE WITH THESE MONSTERS IN PUBLIC WE ARE ALL A TRIFLE VAIN AND DISLIKE HAVING OUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS SHOWN UP IN ELECTRIC LIGHT
THE OTHER ROOM WAS SIX AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO BE LINDSTROEM'S KITCHEN FROM THE KITCHEN A DOUBLE TRAP DOOR LED TO THE LOFT WHERE WE INTENDED TO KEEP A QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS AND OUTFIT THE WALLS CONSISTED OF THREE INCH PLANKS
WE HAD WITH US TEN PAIRS OF SNOW SHOES AND ONE HUNDRED SETS OF DOG HARNESS OF THE ALASKA ESKIMO PATTERN THE ALASKA ESKIMO DRIVE THEIR DOGS IN TANDEM THE WHOLE PULL IS THUS STRAIGHT AHEAD IN THE DIRECTION THE SLEDGE IS GOING
I DID NOT KNOW THE CONDITIONS ON THE BARRIER AS I AFTERWARDS CAME TO KNOW THEM OF COURSE THESE SLEDGES WERE VERY HEAVY WE TOOK TWENTY PAIRS OF SKI ALL OF THE FINEST HICKORY THEY WERE EIGHT FEET LONG AND PROPORTIONATELY NARROW
WE MAY DIVIDE IT INTO TWO CLASSES THE OUTFIT FOR SPECIALLY LOW TEMPERATURES AND THAT FOR MORE MODERATE TEMPERATURES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD YET WINTERED ON THE BARRIER SO WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
WE WANTED NOTHING ELSE IN AND AROUND WINTER QUARTERS OUTSIDE THE MITS WE WORE AN OUTER COVERING OF WINDPROOF MATERIAL SO AS NOT TO WEAR THEM OUT TOO QUICKLY THESE MITS ARE NOT VERY STRONG THOUGH THEY ARE GOOD AND WARM
IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A TRANSITIONAL STAGE WHEN ONE FEELS THE COLD SMARTING IN ONE'S TOES AND TRIES TO GET RID OF IT BY STAMPING THE FEET AS A RULE THIS IS SUCCESSFUL THE WARMTH RETURNS OR THE CIRCULATION IS RESTORED
WHICH WAS A GOOD DEAL LONGER THAN THE BAG ITSELF IT WAS EASY TO TIE THE END OF THE COVER TOGETHER LIKE THE MOUTH OF THE SACK AND THIS KEPT THE SNOW OUT OF THE BAG DURING THE DAY'S MARCH
THE BEST PROOF OF THIS WAS THAT THE LIQUID IN OUR COMPASSES FROZE BEFORE THE SPIRITS IN A FLASK WE WERE NATURALLY INCONVENIENCED BY THIS BESIDES THESE WE HAD AN ORDINARY LITTLE POCKET COMPASS TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS ONE BY ZEISS AND THE OTHER BY GOERTZ
WE ALSO HAD A DOZEN THIN SLEEPING BAGS WHICH I THOUGHT OF USING INSIDE THE BIG THICK ONES IF THE COLD SHOULD BE TOO SEVERE EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED BUT NOT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT THE OUTER SLEEPING BAGS WERE MADE BY MISTER BRANDT FURRIER OF BERGEN
THE DOORS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY THICK AND STRONG AND FITTED INTO OBLIQUE GROOVES SO THAT THEY CLOSED VERY TIGHTLY THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS A TRIPLE ONE IN THE END WALL OF THE MAIN ROOM AND A DOUBLE ONE IN THE KITCHEN
IF I HAD EVER CHERISHED ANY ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF A DAINTY LITTLE FOOT I AM SURE THE LAST TRACE OF SUCH VANITY DIED OUT ON THE DAY I PASSED THE SHOEMAKER'S WINDOW AND BEHELD MY OWN BOOTS
I DECIDED THIS TIME TO TRY A COMBINATION OF STIFF AND SOFT FOOT GEAR SO THAT WE COULD USE THE SPLENDID HUITFELDT HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS BUT THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER OF OUR WHOLE OUTFIT NOTHING CAUSED ME MORE WORRY
WE HAD LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT LYING OUT IN SMALL THIN LINEN BAGS IN EVERY POSSIBLE STATE OF THE WEATHER THE POWDER WAS AS GOOD THE LAST DAY AS THE FIRST WE ALSO TOOK DRIED MILK FROM A FIRM IN WISCONSIN THIS MILK HAD AN ADDITION OF MALT AND SUGAR
IN THIS WAY WE ALWAYS KEPT OURSELVES FREE FROM THE ANNOYANCE OF DRIFTING SNOW WE ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HAVING THE BAGS MADE OF THE VERY BEST SORT OF SKIN AND TOOK CARE THAT THE THIN SKIN OF THE BELLY WAS REMOVED
AND THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE ROOF WE CARRIED SIX STRONG EYEBOLTS A METRE LONG TO BE RAMMED INTO THE BARRIER BETWEEN THESE BOLTS AND THOSE ON THE HUT STEEL WIRES WERE TO BE STRETCHED WHICH COULD BE DRAWN QUITE TIGHT WE ALSO HAD TWO SPARE CABLES
WE HAD TEN SLEDGES MADE BY A FIRM OF SPORTING OUTFITTERS IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE BUILT LIKE THE OLD NANSEN SLEDGES BUT RATHER BROADER AND WERE TWELVE FEET LONG THE RUNNERS WERE OF THE BEST AMERICAN HICKORY SHOD WITH STEEL
I HAD DRAWN THE MAKER'S ATTENTION TO THIS BEFOREHAND AND ASKED HIM TO USE AS PURE A SPIRIT AS POSSIBLE WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS I STILL DO NOT KNOW BUT THE SPIRIT HE EMPLOYED WAS HIGHLY DILUTE
BESIDES THE PEMMICAN WE HAD BISCUITS MILK POWDER AND CHOCOLATE THE BISCUITS WERE A PRESENT FROM A WELL KNOWN NORWEGIAN FACTORY AND DID ALL HONOUR TO THEIR ORIGIN THEY WERE SPECIALLY BAKED FOR US AND WERE MADE OF OATMEAL WITH THE ADDITION OF DRIED MILK AND A LITTLE SUGAR
MOTIONLESS JIMMIE DALE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE SILENT OUTSTRETCHED FORM THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE DESK AND SLOWLY DELIBERATELY PICKED UP THE SIGNED CONFESSION AND THE STEAMSHIP TICKET HE HELD THEM AN INSTANT
AUTOMATICALLY HE QUICKENED HIS STEPS A LITTLE IT WAS USELESS FUTILE PROFITLESS FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST TO DISTURB HIMSELF OVER HIS FAILURE THERE WAS THE LETTER
EXPOSURE THREATENING YOU AT ANY MOMENT WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME AGAIN THAT I LIE CARLING BUT NOW THE MAN MADE NO ANSWER HE HAD SUNK A LITTLE DEEPER IN HIS CHAIR
AND DROPPED IT BACK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN THERE WAS NO LABEL ON IT BUT IT NEEDED NONE THE STRONG PENETRATING ODOR OF BITTER ALMONDS WAS TELLTALE EVIDENCE ENOUGH IT WAS PRUSSIC
A SMALL GLASS VIAL ROLLED UPON THE CARPET AND THEN EVEN AS JIMMIE DALE SPRANG FORWARD THE OTHER PITCHED HEAD LONG OVER THE COUCH AND IN A MOMENT IT WAS OVER PRESENTLY JIMMIE DALE PICKED UP THE VIAL
NO HE CRIED I WON'T I CAN'T MY GOD I I WON'T THE AUTOMATIC IN JIMMIE DALE'S HAND EDGED FORWARD THE FRACTION OF AN INCH I HAVE NOT USED THIS YET YOU UNDERSTAND NOW WHY DON'T YOU HE SAID UNDER HIS BREATH
AND A SILVERY LAUGH THE WORDS HAD FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A SORT OF SINGSONG REFRAIN THAT FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD BEEN RUNNING THROUGH HIS HEAD A STRANGE ENOUGH GUIDING STAR TO MOULD AND DICTATE EVERY ACTION IN HIS LIFE
WHO KNEW AND THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY NOW SINCE THE MAN WAS DEAD JIMMIE DALE PUT THE PIECES IN HIS POCKET WENT TO THE SAFE OPENED IT AND TOOK OUT A PARCEL LOCKED THE SAFE CAREFULLY
HIS EYES TOO HAD IN NO DEGREE RELAXED THEIR VIGILANCE AND ONCE HALF GRIMLY HALF SARDONICALLY HE SMILED TO HIMSELF
WAS CLOSE TO HIM NOW WITHIN REACH AND AS FAR REMOVED AS THOUGH A THOUSAND MILES SEPARATED THEM SHE WAS THERE BUT HE COULD NOT RECOGNISE A FACE THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN
LIFTED UNTIL THE MUZZLE WAS ON A LINE WITH CARLING'S EYES CARLING'S HAND REACHED OUT STILL SHAKING AND TOOK THE PEN AND HIS BODY DRAGGED LIMPLY FORWARD HUNG OVER THE DESK
WITH AN EFFORT HE CHOKED BACK THE BITTER IMPOTENT LAUGH THAT ROSE TO HIS LIPS THEY WERE TALKING LAUGHING AROUND HIM HER VOICE YES
CARLING'S PEN TRAVELLED HALTINGLY ACROSS THE PAPER THEN WITH A QUEER LOW CRY AS HE SIGNED HIS NAME HE DROPPED THE PEN FROM HIS FINGERS AND RISING UNSTEADILY FROM HIS CHAIR
AND WITH THIS STEAMSHIP TICKET WHICH YOU OBTAINED YESTERDAY WHILE OUT AT LUNCH BY SENDING A DISTRICT MESSENGER BOY WITH THE MONEY AND INSTRUCTIONS IN A SEALED ENVELOPE TO PURCHASE FOR YOU YOU WENT UP TO THE MOYNES FLAT
BUT BEFORE LEAVING YOU PRETENDED TO DISCOVER THE THEFT OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT DONE UP IN A PAPER PARCEL WAS EVEN THEN REPOSING IN YOUR DESK YOU BROUGHT THE PARCEL HOME PUT IT IN THAT SAFE THERE
JIMMIE DALE LEANED FORWARD FROM HEADQUARTERS WITH A REPORT HE SAID IN A LOW TONE AH EXCLAIMED THE BANK OFFICIAL SHARPLY WELL IT'S ABOUT TIME I'VE BEEN WAITING UP FOR IT
AND HE TRIED TO SPEAK BUT HIS VOICE WAS AN INCOHERENT MUTTERING I'LL NOT WASTE WORDS SAID JIMMIE DALE IN HIS GRIM MONOTONE I'M NOT SURE ENOUGH MYSELF THAT I COULD KEEP MY HANDS OFF YOU MUCH LONGER
OF THE SECRET SERVICE HAD FINALLY ADMITTED DEFEAT AND A SHADOW NO LONGER SKULKED DAY AND NIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE SANCTUARY AND LARRY THE BAT BORE THE GOVERNMENT INDORSEMENT SO TO SPEAK OF BEING NO MORE SUSPICIOUS A CHARACTER
OR ONE OF THOSE JUST PASSING IN THE AISLE IT HAD FALLEN AT HIS FEET AS HE HAD STOOPED OVER FOR HIS HAT BUT FROM JUST EXACTLY WHAT DIRECTION HE COULD NOT TELL HIS EYES EAGERLY HUNGRILY
HE HAD REACHED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM NOW AND WITH A QUICK SUDDEN MOVEMENT JERKED HIS HAND TO THE DIAL OF THE SAFE THAT STOOD AGAINST THE WALL BUT JIMMIE DALE WAS QUICKER WITHOUT SHIFTING HIS POSITION HIS AUTOMATIC WHIPPED FROM HIS POCKET
HIS LIPS WERE WORKING MECHANICALLY HE SANK DOWN AGAIN IN HIS CHAIR JIMMIE DALE STILL LEANED OVER THE DESK RESTING HIS WEIGHT ON HIS RIGHT ELBOW THE AUTOMATIC IN HIS RIGHT HAND COVERING CARLING YOU CUR WHISPERED
YOUR CO OFFICIALS WERE OPPOSED TO HIS APPOINTMENT BUT YOU DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU PLEADED TO GIVE THE MAN HIS CHANCE AND IN YOUR HELLISH INGENUITY SAW YOUR WAY THEN OUT OF THE TRAP AN EX CONVICT FROM SING SING
EVERY EFFORT THAT HE HAD EVER MADE TO FIND HER HAD BEEN USELESS SHE WAS TOO CLEVER FAR TOO CLEVER FOR THAT SHE TOO WOULD KNOW THAT HE COULD AND WOULD RECOGNISE HER VOICE WHERE HE COULD RECOGNISE NOTHING ELSE
IT WAS ENOUGH WASN'T IT WHAT CHANCE HAD HE JIMMIE DALE PAUSED HIS LEFT HAND CLENCHED UNTIL THE SKIN FORMED WHITISH KNOBS OVER THE KNUCKLES CARLING'S TONGUE SOUGHT HIS LIPS MADE A CIRCUIT OF THEM
THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF HE COULD REACH THE ENTRANCE AHEAD OF HER SHE TOO MIGHT BE TALKING AND LAUGHING AS SHE LEFT THE THEATRE JUST A SINGLE WORD JUST A TONE THAT WAS ALL HE ASKED
JIMMIE DALE MOVED OVER AND STOOD IN FRONT OF CARLING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DESK AND STARED SILENTLY AT THE IMMACULATE FASHIONABLY GROOMED FIGURE BEFORE HIM UNDER THE PROLONGED GAZE CARLING'S COMPOSURE
WAVED HIS HAND TAKE A CHAIR HE SAID OVER HIS SHOULDER AND THEN TURNING IN THE ACT OF DROPPING INTO HIS OWN CHAIR GRASPED SUDDENLY AT THE EDGE OF THE DESK INSTEAD
FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS AND GOD KNOWS HOW MANY BEFORE THAT YOU'VE GONE THE PACE THE LAVISHNESS OF THIS BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT OF YOURS IS COMMON TALK IN NEW YORK FAR IN EXCESS OF A BANK CASHIER'S SALARY
AND THEN SUDDENLY HE REALISED THAT HE WAS ATTRACTING ATTENTION LEVEL STARES FROM THE WOMEN RETURNED HIS GAZE
YOU LIE HE CRIED DO YOU HEAR YOU LIE I TELL YOU YOU LIE JIMMIE DALE'S LIPS PARTED OMINOUSLY SIT DOWN HE GRITTED BETWEEN HIS TEETH THE WHITE IN CARLING'S FACE HAD TURNED TO GRAY
IN HARLEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECRETING THEM SOMEWHERE THERE YOU PRETENDED TO BE MUCH DISAPPOINTED AT FINDING MOYNE OUT YOU HAD JUST COME FOR A LITTLE SOCIAL VISIT
SELECTED A CIGARETTE AND FASTIDIOUSLY TAPPED ITS END ON HIS THUMB NAIL INSPECTOR BURTON IN PLAIN CLOTHES HE OBSERVED MUSINGLY TO HIMSELF I WONDER IF IT'S JUST A FLUKE
EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD DONE THE JOB AND HAD THE BALANCE SOMEWHERE WHAT WOULD HIS DENIALS HIS PROTESTATIONS OF INNOCENCE COUNT FOR HE WAS AN EX CONVICT A HARDENED CRIMINAL CAUGHT RED HANDED WITH A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS OF ROBBERY
SAID CARLING ICILY YOU REFUSE ABSOLUTELY JIMMIE DALE'S VOICE HAD A LINGERING WISTFUL NOTE IN IT I REFUSE SAID CARLING BLUNTLY I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
THE REST OF THE HOUSE WAS IN DARKNESS YES SAID JIMMIE DALE NODDING HIS HEAD I RATHER THOUGHT SO THE SERVANTS WILL HAVE RETIRED HOURS AGO IT'S SAFE ENOUGH
JIMMIE DALE SMILED INDULGENTLY MY MASK IS ONLY FOR EFFECT HE SAID MY NAME IS SMITH YES SAID CARLING I AM VERY STUPID THANK YOU
THAN THAT OF A DISREPUTABLE BUT HARMLESS DOPE FIEND OF THE UNDERWORLD LARRY THE BAT THE GRAY SEAL JIMMIE DALE THE MILLIONAIRE
MAKING A CORNER GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY THAT HE SOUGHT AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE ON THE SIDE STREET THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS FROM THE WINDOWS SHONE OUT ON A COMPARATIVELY DESERTED PAVEMENT
IN A MEASURE AT LEAST SEEMED TO FORSAKE HIM HE BEGAN TO DRUM NERVOUSLY WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE DESK AND SHIFT UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR AND THEN FROM FIRST ONE POCKET AND THEN THE OTHER
I GUESS IT'S ALL UP I GUESS I KNEW IT WOULD BE SOME DAY MOYNE HADN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT I STOLE THE MONEY MYSELF FROM THE BANK TO NIGHT I GUESS IT'S ALL UP
SUBCONSCIOUSLY TELEGRAPHING TO HIS MIND THE FACT THAT THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER WAS HERS HERS AND SHE MUST BE ONE OF THOSE AROUND HIM ONE OF THOSE CROWDING EITHER THE ROW OF SEATS IN FRONT OR BEHIND
AS INDEED HE HAD MET AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH MOST OF THE ELITE OF THE UNDERWORLD THE WOWZER BEYOND A SHADOW OF DOUBT IN HIS OWN PROFESSION STOOD UPON A PLANE ENTIRELY BY HIMSELF AMONG THOSE QUALIFIED TO SPEAK
THE ACTUAL DETAILS OF HOW YOU STOLE THE MONEY TO DAY DO NOT MATTER NOW A LITTLE LATER PERHAPS IN COURT BUT NOT NOW YOU WERE THE LAST TO LEAVE THE BANK
AND WITH A LOW STARTLED CRY STARED ACROSS THE ROOM JIMMIE DALE WAS LEANING BACK AGAINST THE DOOR THAT WAS CLOSED NOW BEHIND HIM AND ON JIMMIE DALE'S FACE WAS A BLACK SILK MASK
OR HYDROCYANIC ACID PROBABLY THE MOST DEADLY POISON AND THE SWIFTEST IN ITS ACTION THAT WAS KNOWN TO SCIENCE CARLING HAD PROVIDED AGAINST THAT SOME DAY IN HIS CONFESSION FOR A LITTLE SPACE
QUITE EVIDENTLY REGARDLESS OF COST AS A COMBINATION LIBRARY AND STUDY CARLING IN A SOMEWHAT POMPOUS FASHION WALKED STRAIGHT AHEAD TOWARD THE CARVED MAHOGANY FLAT TOPPED DESK AND AS HE REACHED IT
IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE STOLEN THE MONEY YOURSELF AND I DIDN'T SAID JIMMIE DALE I FOUND IT HIDDEN IN THE HOME OF ONE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES
INEVITABLY WAS WITH HIM AT MOMENTS SUCH AS THESE IT SEEMED IT ALWAYS SEEMED THAT WITH AN UNOPENED LETTER OF HERS IN HIS POSSESSION IT WAS AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO OPEN A PAGE IN THE BOOK OF FATE AND READ
WHEN YOU MUST HAVE MONEY OR FACE RUIN AND EXPOSURE YOU SAW IT THEN A YEAR AGO THE DAY THAT MOYNE CONCEALING NOTHING OF HIS PRISON RECORD APPLIED THROUGH FRIENDS FOR A POSITION IN THE BANK
AT THE CORNER HE STOPPED TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE AND THE FLAME OF THE MATCH SPURTING UP DISCLOSED A FACE THAT WAS WORN AND HAGGARD HE THREW THE MATCH AWAY SMILED A LITTLE WEARILY AND WENT ON
HE HAD ONCE HEARD THAT AND THAT HE WOULD RECOGNISE AGAIN HE STRAINED TO CATCH TO INDIVIDUALISE THE TONE SOUNDS THAT FLOATED IN A MEDLEY ABOUT HIM IT WAS USELESS OF COURSE
AND BESIDES OF COURSE NOT UNTIL YOU HAD PLANTED THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS TO DAMN HIM AND WRECK HIS LIFE AND HOME YOU WERE EVEN GENEROUS IN THE AMOUNT YOU DEPRIVED YOURSELF OF OUT OF THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
YOU WANT TO PLEAD FOR HIM CARLING FLUNG OUT GRUFFLY WELL HE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ALL THAT BEFORE IT'S QUITE USELESS FOR YOU TO BRING IT UP THE MAN HAS HAD HIS CHANCE ALREADY
THERE WAS AMPLE LIGHT TO READ BY EVEN AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AS THE CURB AND JIMMIE DALE WITH AN APPROVING NOD TURNED THE CORNER AND WALKED ALONG A FEW STEPS UNTIL OPPOSITE THE FARTHEST WINDOW BUT
TIGHT PACKED THE MASS OF PEOPLE JOSTLED ELBOWED AND PUSHED GOOD NATUREDLY IT WAS A VOICE NOW HER VOICE THAT HE WAS LISTENING FOR BUT THOUGH IT SEEMED THAT EVERY FACULTY WAS STRAINED AND INTENT UPON THAT ONE EFFORT
HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE STRENUOUS MONTHS AND WEEKS JUST PAST THE STORM RAISED BY THE NEWSPAPERS AT THE THEFT OF OLD LUDDY'S DIAMONDS HAD SUBSIDED INTO SPORADIC DIATRIBES AIMED AT THE POLICE KLINE
AND THEN JIMMIE DALE LAUGHED NOT PLEASANTLY YES THERE'S A WAY CARLING HE SAID GRIMLY THAT'S WHY I'M HERE HE PICKED UP A SHEET OF WRITING PAPER AND PUSHED IT ACROSS THE DESK THEN A PEN
YOU JIMMIE DALE'S VOICE CHOKED AGAIN YOU BLOT ON GOD'S EARTH YOU SLIPPED THE MONEY AND TICKET UNDER THE CHILD'S MATTRESS CARLING CAME FORWARD WITH A LURCH IN HIS CHAIR AND HIS HANDS WENT OUT
THOMAS H CARLING FROM THE PAPER JIMMIE DALE'S EYES SHIFTED TO THE FIGURE BY THE COUCH AND THE PAPER FLUTTERED SUDDENLY FROM HIS FINGERS TO THE DESK CARLING WAS REELING CLUTCHING AT HIS THROAT
CARLING WAS BABBLING LET ME OUT OF THIS FOR GOD'S SAKE LET ME OUT OF THIS CARLING SAID JIMMIE DALE HOARSELY I STOOD BESIDE A LITTLE BED TO NIGHT AND LOOKED AT A BABY GIRL A LITTLE BABY GIRL WITH GOLDEN HAIR
SAID JIMMIE DALE SLOWLY I HAVEN'T COUNTED IT YOUR BANK WAS ROBBED THIS EVENING AT CLOSING TIME I UNDERSTAND YES CARLING'S VOICE WAS EXCITED NOW
HIS VOICE WAS RISING GRADUALLY WELL SIR LET ME TELL YOU THAT MISTER CARLING SAID JIMMIE DALE IN A LOW EVEN TONE UNLESS YOU MODERATE YOUR VOICE SOME ONE IN THE HOUSE MIGHT HEAR YOU I AM QUITE WELL AWARE OF THAT
FOR AN INSTANT NEITHER MAN SPOKE NOR MOVED THEN CARLING SPARE BUILT DAPPER IN EVENING CLOTHES EDGED BACK FROM THE DESK AND LAUGHED A LITTLE UNCERTAINLY
YOUR BANK WAS ROBBED TO NIGHT OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND HERE THE OTHER NINETY THOUSAND ARE IN YOUR SAFE YOU LIE ASHEN TO THE LIPS CARLING HAD RISEN IN HIS CHAIR
ALMOST FEVERISHLY NOW HE WAS SEEKING AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN AND READ IT UNOBSERVED AN EAGERNESS UPON HIM THAT MINGLED EXHILARATION AT THE LURE OF DANGER WITH A SENSE OF PREMONITION THAT IRRITABLY
STILL HOLDING IT BY THE TWEEZERS DROPPED IT ON HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND PRESSED THE SEAL DOWN ON THE FACE OF THE TOPMOST PACKAGE OF BANKNOTES HE TIED THE PARCEL UP THEN AND PICKING UP THE PEN ADDRESSED IT IN PRINTED CHARACTERS
NO NO CARLING PUSHED AWAY THE PEN I'M RUINED RUINED AS IT IS BUT THIS WOULD MEAN THE PENITENTIARY TOO WHERE YOU TRIED TO SEND AN INNOCENT MAN IN YOUR PLACE YOU HOUND WHERE YOU SOME OTHER WAY
JIMMIE DALE THERE'S JUST ONE REASON ONLY ONE THAT KEEPS ME FROM PUTTING A BULLET THROUGH YOU WHILE YOU SIT THERE WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT THERE IS THAT LITTLE STORY FIRST SHALL I TELL IT TO YOU NOW
IN MOYNE'S HOME UP IN HARLEM
A DAWNING LOOK OF TERROR IN THE EYES THAT HELD FASCINATED ON JIMMIE DALE YOU CUR SAID JIMMIE DALE AGAIN YOU CUR WITH YOUR DEVIL'S WORK A YEAR AGO YOU SAW THIS NIGHT COMING
STARING AT THEM THEN METHODICALLY BEGAN TO TEAR THEM INTO LITTLE PIECES A STRANGE TIRED SMILE HOVERING ON HIS LIPS THE MAN WAS DEAD NOW THERE WOULD BE DISGRACE ENOUGH FOR SOME ONE TO BEAR A MOTHER PERHAPS
A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE AND A SILVERY LAUGH JUST THAT NO MORE JIMMIE DALE IN HIS FAVOURITE SEAT AN AISLE SEAT SOME SEVEN OR EIGHT ROWS BACK FROM THE ORCHESTRA STARED AT THE STAGE
TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES ABSORBED IN THE LAST ACT OF THE PLAY INWARDLY QUITE OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT EVEN A PLAY WAS GOING ON A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE
WHAT SUDDEN EMERGENCY WAS THE GRAY SEAL CALLED UPON TO FACE THIS TIME WHAT ROLE UNREHEARSED WITHOUT WARNING MUST HE PLAY WHAT STORY OF GRIM
BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A WEALTHY MAN IN YOUR OWN RIGHT AND SO IN REALITY YOU WERE ONCE BUT YOU WENT THROUGH YOUR FORTUNE TWO YEARS AGO
BUT YOU HOW DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU ARE RETURNING THE MONEY TO THE BANK EXACTLY SAID JIMMIE DALE CARLING WAS ONCE MORE THE POMPOUS BANK OFFICIAL
WHO WAS ALREADY ASLEEP IN BED
I WANT TO SEE MISTER THOMAS H CARLING CASHIER OF THE HUDSON MERCANTILE NATIONAL BANK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SAID JIMMIE DALE EARNESTLY I AM MISTER CARLING REPLIED THE OTHER WHAT IS IT
HE EXPLAINED AS HE LED THE WAY TOWARD THE LIGHTED ROOM THIS WAY PLEASE BEHIND THE OTHER ACROSS THE HALL JIMMIE DALE FOLLOWED AND CLOSE AT CARLING'S HEELS ENTERED THE ROOM WHICH WAS FITTED UP
WITH THEIR PROSPEROUS WELL GROOMED ESCORTS THERE WAS THE WOWZER OVER THERE SLEEK DAPPER SQUIRMING IN AND OUT OF THE THRONG WITH THE AGILITY AND STEALTH OF A CAT AS LARRY THE BAT HE HAD MET THE WOWZER MANY TIMES
POKE GETTER IN THE UNITED STATES THE CROWD THINNED IN THE LOBBY THINNED DOWN TO THE LAST FEW BELATED STRAGGLERS WHO PASSED HIM AS HE STILL LOITERED IN THE ENTRANCE
AND CARRIED THE PARCEL TO THE DESK HE OPENED IT THERE INSIDE WERE NEARLY TWO DOZEN LITTLE PACKAGES OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS THE OTHER TWO PACKAGES THAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM HE ADDED TO THE REST
FROM HIS POCKET HE TOOK OUT THE THIN METAL INSIGNIA CASE AND WITH THE TINY TWEEZERS LIFTED UP ONE OF THE GRAY COLOURED DIAMOND SHAPED PAPER SEALS HE MOISTENED THE ADHESIVE SIDE AND
TO GET BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOME LIFE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES MISSUS MOYNE WAS GENUINELY PLEASED AND GRATEFUL
WHO SMILED AS SHE SLEPT CARLING SHIVERED AND PASSED A SHAKING HAND ACROSS HIS FACE TAKE THIS PEN SAID JIMMIE DALE MONOTONOUSLY OR THIS THE AUTOMATIC
WITH THE PARCEL UNDER HIS ARM STEPPED TO THE DOOR AND UNLOCKED IT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT ON THE THRESHOLD FOR A SINGLE QUICK COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM THEN PASSED ON OUT INTO THE STREET
A PRONOUNCEMENT UPON HIMSELF THAT MIGHT MEAN LIFE OR DEATH HE HURRIED ON PEOPLE STILL PASSED BY HIM TOO MANY AND THEN A CAFE JUST AHEAD
AND IT WAS SAFER MUCH MORE CIRCUMSPECT ON YOUR PART NOT TO ORDER THE FLAT SEARCHED AT ONCE BUT ONLY AS A LAST RESORT AS IT WERE AFTER YOU HAD LED THE POLICE TO TRAIL HIM ALL EVENING AND STILL REMAIN WITHOUT A CLEW
HE LEANED BACK AND SURVEYED JIMMIE DALE CRITICALLY WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK EYES AH QUITE SO HE OBSERVED THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE MASK BUT I AM STILL A LITTLE IN THE DARK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OTHERS IN THE SAME ROW OF SEATS AS HIS OWN WERE IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO GET BY HIM WITH A MUTTERED APOLOGY JIMMIE DALE RAISED THE SEAT OF HIS CHAIR ALLOWING THESE LATTER TO PASS HIM AND THEN
HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE FROM THE SIDEWALK WATCHING WITH A SORT OF SPECULATIVE SATISFACTION A MAN'S SHADOW THAT PASSED CONSTANTLY TO AND FRO ACROSS THE DRAWN BLINDS OF ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS
SLIPPING THE LETTER INTO HIS POCKETBOOK HE SNATCHED UP HIS HAT FROM THE SEAT RACK THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE KNOWING HE WAS THERE SHE WOULD BE ON HER GUARD BUT IN THE LOBBY AMONG THE CROWD AND UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE
HELD A DISCONCERTING BEAD ON CARLING'S FOREHEAD PLEASE DON'T DO THAT SAID JIMMIE DALE SOFTLY IT'S RATHER A GOOD MAKE THAT SAFE I DARE SAY IT WOULD TAKE ME HALF AN HOUR TO OPEN IT
JIMMIE DALE A BLOCK DOWN HE TURNED FROM BROADWAY OUT OF THE THEATRE CROWDS THAT STREAMED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS PAST HIM THE LETTER
CRITICALLY SWEPT FACE AFTER FACE WHICH ONE WAS HERS WHAT IRONY SHE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE TO KNOW FOR WHOM INDEED HE RISKED HIS LIFE EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR
AS HE HALTED HERE AT THE EDGE OF THE STREET HE GLANCED QUICKLY BEHIND HIM AT A MAN WHOM HE HAD JUST PASSED THE OTHER HAD PAUSED AT THE CORNER AND WAS STARING DOWN THE STREET JIMMIE DALE INSTANTLY AND NONCHALANTLY PRODUCED HIS CIGARETTE CASE
AND NOTIFIED THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANK BY TELEPHONE FROM HERE OF THE ROBBERY SUGGESTING THAT POLICE HEADQUARTERS BE ADVISED AT ONCE HE TOLD YOU TO GO AHEAD AND ACT AS YOU SAW BEST YOU NOTIFIED THE POLICE
ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME IT WAS ONLY ONE MORE OCCASION ADDED TO THE INNUMERABLE ONES THAT HAD GONE BEFORE IN WHICH SHE HAD ELUDED HIM AND NOW THERE WAS THE LETTER
INDEED IT SEEMED A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME NOW SINCE HE HAD HEARD FROM HER EVEN IN THAT WAY THOUGH IT WAS NOT SO MANY DAYS AGO AFTER ALL PERHAPS IT WAS THE CALM AS IT WERE THAT BY CONTRAST
AND THAT WAS ALL HE HAD EVER SEEN OF HER ALL THAT HE HAD EVER HEARD OF HER EXCEPT THOSE LETTERS OF COURSE EACH OF WHICH HAD OUTLINED THE DETAILS OF SOME AFFAIR FOR THE GRAY SEAL TO EXECUTE
WHAT HAS A STORY GOT TO DO WITH THIS SNAPPED CARLING THE MAN HAS GOT A HOME SAID JIMMIE DALE SOFTLY A HOME AND A WIFE AND A LITTLE BABY GIRL
OR SOMETHING ELSE WE'LL SEE JIMMIE DALE TOOK A BOX OF MATCHES FROM HIS POCKET THE FIRST WOULD NOT LIGHT
THE EX CONVICT IN THE BANK'S EMPLOY YOU KNEW MOYNE WAS DINING OUT TO NIGHT YOU KNEW WHERE AND AT A HINT FROM YOU THE POLICE TOOK UP THE TRAIL A LITTLE LATER IN THE EVENING YOU TOOK THESE TWO PACKAGES OF BANKNOTES FROM THE REST
I'LL TELEPHONE HEADQUARTERS TO MAKE THE ARREST AT ONCE JUST A MINUTE INTERPOSED JIMMIE DALE GRAVELY I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO A LITTLE STORY FIRST A STORY
YOU'RE WISER THAN YOU KNOW MY MAN THAT'S WHAT WE SUSPECTED
EXTRACTED THE KEY FROM THE DOOR LOCK HELD IT UP FOR THE OTHER TO SEE THEN DROPPED IT INTO HIS POCKET AND HIS VOICE COLD BEFORE
THOUGH I EXPECTED YOU WOULD TELEPHONE RATHER THAN THIS COME IN THANK YOU SAID JIMMIE DALE COURTEOUSLY AND STEPPED INTO THE HALL THE OTHER CLOSED THE FRONT DOOR THE SERVANTS ARE IN BED OF COURSE
THE PEN SPLUTTERED ON THE PAPER A BEAD OF SWEAT SPURTING FROM THE MAN'S FOREHEAD DROPPED TO THE SHEET THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE ROOM A MINUTE PASSED ANOTHER
AS HE SMILED IN PRIVATE YOU'VE A STRANGE METHOD OF SECURING PRIVACY HAVEN'T YOU A BIT MELODRAMATIC ISN'T IT
AND DISAPPOINTMENT THAT BURNED WITHIN HIM STEPPED OUT TO THE PAVEMENT AND HEADED DOWN BROADWAY AFTER ALL HE HAD KNOWN IT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS ALL THE TIME IT HAD
BUT THOUGH HE TOOK MISTER FAULKNER AND HIS CREW BY SURPRISE HE DID NOT FIND THEM ENTIRELY UNPREPARED AND AFTER DROPPING EIGHT OF HIS PEOPLE UPON THE SLAVER'S DECK AND BEING HIMSELF SEVERELY WOUNDED IN THE ARM
AND PULL AWAY FROM THE VESSEL'S SIDE WITH GREAT SPEED A SORT OF INSTINCT EXPLAINED TO HIM THE MEANING OF THIS AND HURRYING HIS PEOPLE ON SHORE WITH THE WOUNDED THEY SOUGHT THE SHELTER OF THE JUNGLE ONCE MORE
MAUD KEPT BY HERSELF SHE FELT MISERABLE AND AS IS OFTEN THE CASE REALIZED THAT THE SUCCESS OF HER TREACHERY THUS FAR WHICH IN HER ANTICIPATION HAD PROMISED SO MUCH HAD BUT STILL MORE DEEPLY SHADOWED HER HEART
EVEN THE FOLIAGE SEEMED TO PARTAKE OF THE FRESHNESS OF HIS SPIRIT AND THE WORLD TO BECOME REJUVENATED AND BEAUTIFIED IN EVERY ASPECT IN WHICH HE COULD VIEW IT THIS WAS THE BRIGHT TIDE OF THE PICTURE WHICH HIS IMAGINATION
ALMOST STARTLED AT THE FIENDISH EXPRESSION OF THE QUADROON'S COUNTENANCE AS SHE EMPHASIZED THOSE TWO EXPRESSIVE WORDS I HAVE REASON TO BE ANSWERED MAUD CALMING HER FEELINGS BY AN EFFORT HAS HE WRONGED YOU
YOU ARE AN ENGLISH OFFICER AGENT OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AND SENT HERE TO SUPPRESS THIS VILE TRAFFIC TRUE AND HAVE YOU SUSPECTED NOTHING SINCE YOUR VESSEL HAS BEEN HERE I SUSPECT THAT THIS CAPTAIN RATLIN IS IN SOME WAY CONNECTED WITH THE TRADE
THAT IS WHAT I WOULD REVEAL TO YOU I WILL DISCOVER TO YOU HIS SHIP IF YOU SWEAR TO ARREST HIM SEIZE THE VESSEL AND IF POSSIBLE HANG HIM YOU ARE BITTER INDEED SAID THE OFFICER
HAVE I EVER WRONGED YOU OR YOUR FATHER ASKED CAPTAIN RATLIN REPROACHFULLY DO YOU NOT LOVE THAT WHITE FACED GIRL YOU BROUGHT HITHER AND IF I DID MAUD WHAT WRONG IS THAT TO THEE DID I PROMISE THEE LOVE
AND DETERMINED IF POSSIBLE TO DISCOVER HIS SECRET HE AGAIN BECAME A FREQUENT VISITOR OF DON LEONARDO'S HOUSE WHERE HE WAS SURE TO MEET HIM CONSTANTLY THERE WERE TWO SPIRITS WHOM WE HAVE INTRODUCED TO THE READER IN THIS CONNECTION
NAY I ASKED IT NOT OF YOU SAID THE ANGRY GIRL BUT YOU HAVE DONE ME A GREAT WRONG MAUD ONE THAT YOU DO NOT YOURSELF UNDERSTAND I FORGIVE YOU THOUGH POOR GIRL YOU ARE HARDLY TO BLAME
TRIFLES LIGHTER THAN STRAWS ARE LEVERS IN THE BUILDING UP OF DESTINY CAPTAIN RATLIN TURNED FROM THAT BRIEF INTERVIEW WITH A FEELING HE HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED THE IDEA THAT MISS HUNTINGTON REALLY CARED FOR HIM
UNLOOSING A FINE GOLD CHAIN FROM HIS WATCH AND TOSSING IT AROUND HER NECK AND BE PUNCTUAL AT THAT SPOT TO NIGHT AFTER THE LAST RAY OF TWILIGHT I WILL ANSWERED THE QUADROON
BUT HIS ATTENTIONS AND SERVICES WERE ALL RENDERED UNDER THAT GUISE AND ASPECT WHICH RENDERED THEM TO HER MOST REPULSIVE
MAUD TOO EITHER FOR SAKE OF DISGUISE OR BECAUSE THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER PLAN IMPARTED EXHILARATION OF SPIRITS TO HER WAS MORE AGREEABLE SEEMINGLY FRANK AND FRIENDLY THAN SHE HAD BEEN FOR MANY A LONG DAY
WHICH STOLE IN THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES AND CLOSE TURNING BRANCHES OF THE LOFTY VEGETATION
I WAS THINKING OVER OUR STRANGE FORTUNE SINCE WE LEFT CALCUTTA THE WRECK
IS IT YOU WHO HAVE BETRAYED US
THAT THE YOUNG COMMANDER HAD NEVER SUSPECTED HER OF TREACHERY OR EVEN JEALOUSY TOWARDS HIMSELF BUT NOW HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN BLIND NOT TO HAVE SEEN AND REALIZED
CAPTAIN BRAMBLE THOUGHT IT BEST TO BEAT A RETREAT AT LEAST FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND SO SOUGHT AGAIN THE SHELTER OF THE JUNGLE
AND THIS TIME DIVIDED HIS MEN INTO THREE PARTS ONE TO BOARD AT THE BOWS ONE AT THE STERN AND HIMSELF LEADING A DOZEN PICKED MEN AT THE WAIST THIS DIVISION OF HIS FORCES WAS THE BEST MANOUVRE HE COULD POSSIBLY MAKE
AND WHO WOULD BE ONLY TOO MUCH GRATIFIED AT THE BRINGING BEFORE THEM OF AN OFFENDER TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF HIM CAPTAIN BRAMBLE OF COURSE OFFERED TO MISSUS HUNTINGTON AND HER DAUGHTER HIS OWN CABIN FOR THEIR GREATER COMFORT
HE IS AND BUT NOW AWAITS THE GATHERING OF A CARGO IN MY FATHER'S BARRACOONS TO SAIL WITH THEM TO THE WEST INDIES IT IS NOT HIS FIRST VOYAGE EITHER BUT WHERE IS HIS VESSEL
YES HE LOVES THE WHITE WOMAN WHOM HE BROUGHT TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE THUS FAR AT ALL EVENTS MY GOOD GIRL WE HAVE MUTUAL CAUSE FOR HATE AND WE WILL WORK HEARTILY TOGETHER YOU KNOW WHERE HIS VESSEL LIES I DO
DO YOU PROMISE ME THIS CAPTAIN BRAMBLE I DO IT IS WELL SIR THERE GOES MY WEAPON SAYING WHICH HE HURLED IT FAR INTO THE RIVER'S BED AS SOON AS MAUD SAW HIM SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET
SHE HAD TREACHEROUSLY BROUGHT TO HER FATHER'S DOORS HE HAD NOT BEEN LONG AT THE FACTORY THEREFORE ON LANDING AFTER THE DUEL BEFORE MAUD SOUGHT A PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH HIM
FOR I AM MOST HEARTILY TIRED AND WORN OUT WITH THE STRANGE LIFE WE LEAD HERE THIS CONVERSATION WILL EXPLAIN TO THE READER IN PART THE REASON WHY MISSUS HUNTINGTON AND HER DAUGHTER ENGLISH SUBJECTS AND IN DISTRESS UPON THE COAST
AND BOTH AGREED TO ABIDE STRICTLY BY IT BUT DOUBTED NOT THAT AS CAPTAIN RATLIN HAD NOT BEEN ENGAGED IN ANY SLAVE COMMERCE AND INDEED HAD NOT BEEN IN THE LATE ACTION AT ALL THAT HE WOULD BE VERY SOON LIBERATED AND FREE TO CHOOSE HIS OWN CALLING
WHEN HE MIGHT DISEMBARK A COUPLE OF BOAT LOADS OF SAILORS AND MARINES AND WITH THE QUADROON FOR GUIDE FOLLOW THE PATH THROUGH THE JUNGLE TO WHERE THE SEA WITCH LAY WHY DO YOU MUSE SO LONG AND LONELY MY CHILD
AND I AM NOT ONE TO MISS MY AIM AS YOUR VALIANT LEADER YONDER WELL KNOWS NOW CAPTAIN BRAMBLE I WILL SURRENDER TO YOU PROVIDED YOU ACCEDE TO MY TERMS OTHERWISE YOU CANNOT TAKE ME ALIVE WELL SIR
HAD NOT AT ONCE GONE ON BOARD THE VESSEL OF THEIR SOVEREIGN WHICH LAY IN THE HARBOR AND BEEN CARRIED UPON THEIR DESTINATION FROM THE OUTSET CAPTAIN BRAMBLE HAD RESOLVED NOT TO LET HIS RIVAL SLIP THROUGH HIS FINGERS BY LEAVING PORT HIMSELF
AS SHE CAME IN AND SURPRISED HER GAZING OUT AT A WINDOW VACANTLY
LADY HE SAID TO HER AS THEY SAT TOGETHER THAT AFTERNOON HEAVEN HAS SENT YOU FOR A GUARDIAN ANGEL TO ME YOUR REFINING INFLUENCE HAS COME TO MY HEART AT ITS MOST LONELY ITS MOST NECESSARY MOMENT
LIFTING HER HANDSOME FACE FROM HER HANDS WHERE SHE OFTEN HID IT YOU HAVE LOST ONE LOVER THE GIRL ONLY ANSWERED BY A FLASHING GLANCE OF CONTEMPT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER WHO SHE SAID STERNLY
TO THE HARBOR OF SIERRA LEONE THIS CHAFED THE YOUNG COMMANDER'S SPIRIT SOMEWHAT
FOR TO HAVE SEIZED THE VESSEL WITHOUT HER COMMANDER ON BOARD WOULD HAVE BEEN TO PERFORM BUT HALF THE BUSINESS HE HAD LAID OUT FOR THE NIGHT'S ENGAGEMENT BUT ALL SEEMED NOW PROPITIOUS AND HE AWAITED THE DARKNESS WITH IMPATIENCE
SCARCELY HAD THEY GAINED THE SHADE OF THE THICK UNDERGROWTH WHEN A REPORT LIKE THAT OF A SCORE OF CANNONS RANG UPON THE NIGHT AIR AND HIGH IN THE AIR SOARED A BODY OF FLAME AND WRECK IN TERRIFIC CONFUSION
BEYOND THE ORDINARY INTEREST THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCES HAD CAUSED HAD NOT THUS FAR BEEN ENTERTAINED BY HIM HAD THIS BEEN OTHERWISE HE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE DIFFERENTLY INTERPRETED MANY AGREEABLE TOKENS WHICH SHE HAD GRANTED HIM
AND HAD BEEN TOLD BY CAPTAIN BRAMBLE THAT HE MUST GO FORTHWITH ON BOARD HIS SHIP AS SUCH HE DESIRED TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO MISSUS HUNTINGTON AND HER DAUGHTER A REQUEST WHICH HIS RIVAL COULD HARDLY FIND GROUNDS FOR REFUSING
ME ANSWERED CAPTAIN BRAMBLE
THE DUEL YES IT IS STRANGE I THOUGHT NONE BUT OURSELVES WERE TO BE THERE HE HAS MOVED IN NO DIRECTION SINCE THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN HERE THAT I HAVE NOT FOLLOWED
HE SAYS THAT BUSINESS AND DUTY WHICH HE CANNOT EXPLAIN DETAIN HIM HERE BUT THAT HE WILL SOON LEAVE OF WHICH HE WILL GIVE US DUE NOTICE HEAVEN HASTEN THE PERIOD SAID THE MOTHER IMPATIENTLY
AND THE VESSEL SHAPED HER COURSE ALONG THE COAST TOWARDS SIERRA LEONE WHERE THERE WAS SITTING AN ENGLISH COURT OF ADMIRALTY WITH EXTRAORDINARY AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO SUCH CASES CAPTAIN BRAMBLE WAS NOW ABOUT TO LAY BEFORE THEM
AIDED BY THAT GAUDY PAINTER AND FANCY COLORER HOPE HAD CONJURED UP BEFORE HIS MIND'S EYE BUT THE REVERSE SIDE OF THE PICTURE WAS AT HAND AND NOW HE PAUSED TO ASK HIMSELF SERIOUSLY CAN THIS BE
HIS THOUGHTS WERE FULL OF TOO PURE AN OBJECT TO PERMIT HIM TO PARTICIPATE TO ANY EXTENT IN SO QUESTIONABLE A BUSINESS GLADLY WOULD HE AT ANY MOMENT HAVE THROWN UP HIS CHARGE OF THE SEA WITCH AND HE HAD INDEED PROMISED MISS HUNTINGTON
AND THE NATIVE POWER OF HER BOSOM FOR REVENGE SEEMED TO BE NOW THE FOOD UPON WHICH SHE SUSTAINED LIFE ITSELF TAKING HER LONELY PLACE IN THE CABIN AFTER THE CONVERSATION JUST REFERRED TO SHE AGAIN HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS
WHILE HE WALKED ON WITH THE ENGLISH OFFICER AND HIS PEOPLE OVER THE GROUND THEY HAD JUST PASSED TOWARDS DON LEONARDO'S THERE BEING NOW NO FURTHER CAUSE FOR SECRECY THEY MARCHED OPENLY AND ENLIVENED THE WAY WITH MANY A RUDE JEST
IT WAS NATURAL FOR A HEART SO VILE AS HIS TO COUPLE EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE AND CONNECTION IN SOME SUCH SELFISH SPIRIT WITH HIMSELF IT WAS LIKE HIM MAUD HE SAID TO HER ONE DAY WELL SHE ANSWERED
BUT STOLE OR GLIDED THROUGH THE TANGLED UNDERGROWTH AS THOUGH SHE HAD PASSED HER WHOLE LIFE TIME IN THE DEEP TANGLED WAYS OF THE JUNGLE AS THEY WENT ON THE MOON GRADUALLY ROSE AND LIFTED UP THE DARK PATH BY LITTLE GLEAMINGS
IS IT LIKELY THAT TWO SUCH PERSONS AS I HAVE CONSIDERED SHOULD BE JOINED BY INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP CAN SUCH BARRIERS AS THESE BE BROKEN DOWN BY LOVE ALAS I AM NOT SO BLIND SO FOOLISH SO UNREASONABLE
BEING MORE THAN ONCE STARTLED BY THE GROWL OF SOME WILD ANIMAL WHOSE HAUNTS THEY DISTURBED IT WAS WEARY STRUGGLING BY THIS PATH THROUGH THE WOOD BUT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO APPROACH THE DESIRED POINT BY LAND MAUD HESITATED NOT
NO HE HAD NOT RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD THE QUADROON IT WAS NOT WOUNDED PRIDE
CAPTAIN BRAMBLE DINED WITH DON LEONARDO THAT DAY AND HIS GOOD SPIRITS AND PLEASANT CONVERSE WERE AFTERWARDS THE SUBJECT OF COMMENT EXHIBITING HIM IN A FAIR MORE FAVORABLE LIGHT THAN HE HAD APPEARED IN SINCE HIS ARRIVAL AT THE FACTORY
THE ENGLISH OFFICER LOOKED UPON HER WITH MINGLED FEELINGS OF ADMIRATION FOR HER STRANGE BEAUTY WITH CONTEMPT FOR HER TREACHERY AND WITH A THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT BE MADE PERHAPS THE SUBJECT OF HIS PLEASURE BY A LITTLE MANAGEMENT BY AND BY
IMPRESSIBLE AND READY TO FOLLOW HER SIMPLEST INSTRUCTIONS ALL THIS BETOKENED A NATIVE REFINEMENT OF SOUL ELSE HE COULD NEVER HAVE EVINCED THE PLIABILITY WHICH HAD RENDERED HIM SO PLEASANT AND AGREEABLE A COMPANION TO HER HE SECRETLY LOVED
INDEED MAUD WHO HAD BEEN A SECRET WITNESS OF THE DEED ALREADY REALIZED THAT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE WAS THE ENEMY OF HIM WHOM SHE HAD ONCE LOVED AND WHOM SHE NOW SO BITTERLY DESPISED
WITH ALLOY TO BE IDENTIFIED HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN OVERREACHED BY CAPTAIN RATLIN AND ALSO THAT HE HAD GOOD GROUNDS OF SUSPECTING HIS SUCCESSFUL RIVAL OF BEING EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ENGAGED IN THE ILLEGAL TRADE OF THE COAST
A DOUBLE HEART SHOULD BE DEALT DOUBLY WITH IT WAS I WHO LED THESE PEOPLE HITHER AND I HOPED THE FATE OF SO MANY OF YOUR SHIP'S COMPANY MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOURS BUT YOU ARE A PRISONER NOW AND THERE'S HOPE YET MAUD MAUD
STAND BACK SAID CAPTAIN RATLIN FELLING TWO SEAMEN TO THE EARTH WHO APPROACHED HIM TO LAY HANDS UPON HIS PERSON AND AT THE SAME TIME DRAWING A REVOLVER FROM HIS POCKET STAND BACK I SAY I CARRY THE LIVES OF SIX OF YOU IN THIS WEAPON
AND ONE OR TWO OFFICERS HE QUIETLY PULLED AWAY FROM THE SHIP'S SIDE UNDER COVER OF THE NIGHT AND LANDED AT THE PROPOSED SPOT HERE HE FOUND MAUD PATIENTLY AWAITING HIS COMING AND READY TO LEAD HIM TO THE HIDING PLACE OF THE SEA WITCH AND HER CREW
THE SLAVERS HAD PLACED A SLOW MATCH IN CONNECTION WITH THE MAGAZINE AND HAD BLOWN IN ONE INSTANT OF TIME THAT ENTIRE AND BEAUTIFUL FABRIC INTO TEN THOUSAND ATOMS EVEN MAUD WITH ALL HER HATRED AND PASSION QUAILED AT THE SHOCK
CAPTAIN BRAMBLE SAYS HE SHALL SAIL SOON AND THEN WE CAN GO ROUND TO SIERRA LEONE AND FROM THENCE TAKE PASSAGE DIRECT FOR ENGLAND FOR MY PART I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY CAPTAIN BRAMBLE INSISTS UPON STAYING HERE SO LONG
AND FIVE OF THE SLAVER'S PEOPLE HAD BEEN EITHER MORTALLY WOUNDED OR KILLED OUTRIGHT BUT FROM THE HABIT OF CONSTANTLY WEARING THEIR ARMS EVEN TO PISTOLS WHEN ON THE COAST THEY HAD BEEN FOUND IN A VERY GOOD SITUATION AT EVEN THE SHORTEST NOTICE FOR DEFENDING THEMSELVES
AND WOULD GLADLY HAVE BEEN REVENGED IN ANY WAY FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF THEIR FEELINGS UPON HER WHOM HE SO FONDLY LOVED WITH THIS SIMILARITY OF SENTIMENT IT WAS NOT SINGULAR THAT THEY SHOULD ERE LONG DISCOVER THEMSELVES AND FEELINGS TO EACH OTHER
AND TO WHICH HIS MIND NOW WENT BACK EAGERLY TO RECALL AND CONSIDER UNDER THE NEW PHASE OF FEELING WHICH ACTUATED HIM HOW ELSE COULD HE INTERPRET THAT TEAR BUT AS SPRINGING FROM A HEART THAT WAS FULL OF KINDLY FEELING TOWARDS HIM
VOICES WERE HEARD ISSUING FROM THE FORE HATCH AND TWO OR THREE PETTY OFFICERS WERE SEATED ABOUT THE ENTRANCE TO THE CABIN SMOKING CIGARS AND PIPES ALL UNCONSCIOUS OF ANY DANGER THERE IS YOUR PREY
AND THAT TO PUSH A SUIT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WAS NOT ONLY INDELICATE BUT POSITIVELY INSULTING AND YET HE DID SO TRUE HE DID NOT ACTUALLY IMPORTUNE MISS HUNTINGTON
HE FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT SOME WEEKS EVEN YET BEFORE HE COULD PROSECUTE THE PURPOSE OF HIS VOYAGE AND INDEED HE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ALL INTEREST IN IT
AND LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF VOICES WHICH HAVE A STRANGE AND ECHO LIKE SOUND IN THAT WILD AND TANGLED SPOT HARK THOSE VOICES ARE NOT FROM THE TONGUES OF NATIVES THAT IS ENGLISH WHICH THEY SPEAK
AND WOULD ONLY HAVE REJOICED HAD SHE BELIEVED HE WAS BLOWN TO ATOMS WITH HIS VESSEL BY THE WILD EXPLOSION WHICH HAD SO LATELY SHAKEN THE VERY EARTH UPON WHICH SHE NOW STOOD IT WAS PLAIN THAT UP TO THIS VERY MOMENT HOWEVER
HALF IN DOUBT HALF HOPING IN ONE INSTANT HOW DIFFERENT AN ASPECT ALL THINGS WORE LIFE ITS AIMS THE PERSONS HE MET AT THE DOOR AS HE NOW PASSED OUT
THAT HE FELT WARRANTED IN GOING TO ANY LENGTH IN SECURING POSSESSION OF A CLIPPER CRAFT WHICH HAD BEEN SO FULLY DESCRIBED TO HIM HE WAS NOT WANTING IN PERSONAL COURAGE AND THEREFORE WITH A WELL SELECTED BODY OF SAILORS AND MARINES
I WILL BE PREPARED WHERE SHALL WE MEET AT THE END OF THE CAPE WHERE YOU AND HE MET A FEW DAYS SINCE WHERE WE MET ASKED THE OTHER IN SURPRISE HOW KNEW YOU OF THAT I SAW IT
AS SHE REGARDED THE FINE WORKMANSHIP OF THE CHAIN FOR A MOMENT WITH IDLE AND CHILDLIKE PLEASURE THEN TURNING FROM THE SPOT THEY BOTH RETURNED THOUGH BY DIFFERENT PATHS FROM THE JUNGLE TOWARDS THE DWELLING OF HER FATHER
THERE IS MY HAND ON SO HONORABLE A RESOLUTION SAID MISS HUNTINGTON FRANKLY WHILE A SINGLE TEAR OF PLEASURE TREMBLED IN HER CLEAR LUSTROUS EYES THE YOUNG COMMANDER TOOK THE HAND RESPECTFULLY THAT WAITS EXTENDED TO HIM
ON PRETEXT OF COMMUNICATING TO HIM SOME INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE OF VALUE TO HIM IN CONNECTION WITH HIS OFFICIAL DUTY TO THIS OF COURSE THE ENGLISH OFFICER RESPONDED AT ONCE SHREWDLY SUSPECTING AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE TRUTH
WITH HER LOWER MASTS AND THEIR STANDING RIGGING THE VESSEL WAS MOORED CLOSE TO THE SHORE WITH WHICH A PORTABLE GANGWAY CONNECTED IT SHALLOW AS THE WATER WAS YET SO LIGHT WAS HER DRAFT THAT SHE EVIDENTLY FLOATED UPON ITS SLUGGISH CURRENT
AS TO BELIEVE IT FOR A MOMENT SO ONCE MORE THE HEART OF THE YOUNG COMMANDER WAS HEAVY WITHIN HIS BREAST IN THE MEAN TIME CAPTAIN BRAMBLE HAD FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY THAT AFTERNOON TO SEE MAUD
HOW MANY DO THEY NUMBER I KNOW NOT IT IS NOT IMPORTANT CONTINUED THE ENGLISHMAN TURNING TO HIS FOLLOWERS AND IN A LOW VOICE BIDDING THEM LOOK TO THEIR WEAPONS FOR THE GAME WAS NEAR AT HAND
AND SUCCEEDED ADMIRABLY SINCE HIS OWN PEOPLE OUTNUMBERED THE SLAVERS AND BY DIVIDING THEM HE STRENGTHENED HIS OWN POWER AND WEAKENED THEIRS ONCE MORE UPON THEIR DECK THE HAND TO HAND BATTLE WAS SHORT BLOODY AND DECISIVE
IT WAS A TELL TALE DROP OF CRYSTAL THAT GLISTENED BUT ONE MOMENT THERE COULD IT HAVE BEEN FANCY WAS IT POSSIBLE HE COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN THE MATTER ASSUMED AN ASPECT OF INTENSE IMPORTANCE IT HIS ESTIMATION
YES THAT IS THE RIVER'S BED
WHICH GRATED HARSHLY UPON THE EARS OF THE WOUNDED WHO WERE BORNE UPON LITTERS MADE FROM BRANCHES OF THE HARD DRY LEAVES OF THE PALM AS THEY CAME UPON THE OPEN SPOT WHERE STAND THE BARRACOONS AND DON LEONARDO'S DWELLING
UNTUTORED IN THE WAYS OF THE WORLD AND FASHIONABLE INTRIGUE YET THE QUADROON SAW VERY CLEARLY THAT THROUGH CAPTAIN BRAMBLE SHE MIGHT CONSUMMATE THAT REVENGE WHICH SHE HAD SO SIGNALLY FAILED IN DOING BY THE AGENCY OF THE HOSTILE NEGRO TRIBES
THEY FOUND THE ENTIRE FAMILY AROUSED AND ON THE WATCH THE HEAVY EXPLOSION OF THE SEA WITCH'S MAGAZINE HAVING SEEMED TO THEM LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE DON LEONARDO WHO SHREWDLY SUSPECTED THE TRUTH
AND BENDING OVER THE FAIR HAND HE HELD HE PRESSED IT GENTLY TO HIS LIPS HE WAS NOT REPULSED NOR CHIDED BUT SHE DELICATELY ROSE AND TURNED TO HER MOTHER'S APARTMENT HOW SMALL A THINGS WILL AFFECT THE WHOLE TENOR OF A LIFE TIME
HIST HIST WHISPERED THE QUADROON WE ARE ALMOST UPON THEM IN WHICH DIRECTION ASKED THE ENGLISH OFFICER
UNTIL TOWARDS ITS CLOSE CAPTAIN BRAMBLE FOUND HIMSELF DRIVEN INTO THE FORECASTLE WITH A NUMBER OF HIS FOLLOWERS AND AT THE SAME MOMENT SAW THE MATE OF THE SEA WITCH WITH THOSE OF HIS PEOPLE THAT WERE LEFT ALIVE HASTENING TO EMBARK IN A QUARTERBOAT
THIS WAS A QUESTION THAT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE HAD SEVERAL TIMES ASKED BUT IN VAIN UNTIL NOW
CHAPTER TWELVE THE CONFLICT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE KNEW VERY WELL THAT HE HAD DESPERATE MEN TO DEAL WITH IN THE TAKING OF A SLAVER ON THE COAST BUT HE HAD GATHERED HIS EVIDENCE AND WITNESSES IN SUCH A STRONG ARRAY
CAPTAIN BRAMBLE NOW SAW EVIDENT TOKENS OF A PURPOSE TO UNMOOR THE VESSEL AND LET HER DRIFT OUT INTO THE RIVER WHICH WOULD AT ONCE PLACE HER BEYOND HIS REACH AS HE HAD NO BOATS WITHIN A LEAGUE OF THE SPOT AND THEREFORE HE RESOLVED UPON A SECOND ONSLAUGHT
AND THUS HE HAD STILL REMAINED TO THE PRESENT TIME THOUGH WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE PLAN OF OPERATION FORMED UNTIL HE AVAILED HIMSELF OF MAUD'S PROPOSAL WHY BLESS ME MY CHILD
AND REMAINED WITH HER HEAD BOWED IN HER LAP FOR A LONG LONG WHILE HALF DREAMING HALF WAKING POOR UNTUTORED UNCIVILIZED CHILD OF NATURE
CHAPTER ELEVEN THE HUES OF LOVE CAPTAIN BRAMBLE DID NOT LONG REMAIN CONTENTED ON BOARD HIS SHIP THIS HE COULD NOT DO WHILE HE REALIZED THAT MISS HUNTINGTON WAS SO NEAR UPON THE SHORE
BUT WHEN HE RAISED HIS EYES TO HER FACE AND DETECTED THAT TEAR A THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT RAN THROUGH HIS BRAIN A FAINT SHADOW OF HOPE THAT PERHAPS SHE LOVED HIM OR MIGHT AT SOME FUTURE TIME DO SO
IT WAS NOT THAT WHICH MOVED THE LAUGHTER OF THE SPANISH SLAVER IT WAS EITHER LOVE OR SOMETHING VERY LIKE IT
FOR HE HAD NEVER ASPIRED TO ANY MORE INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP HE WOULD IGNORE THE TRADE ALTOGETHER AND THAT HE WOULD DESPATCH MISTER FAULKNER HIS FIRST OFFICER TO THE OWNERS IN CUBA WITH THE SHIP HE HAD HIMSELF TAKEN IN CHARGE
AND TREMBLED AS SHE CROUCHED TO THE GROUND WITH AVERTED FACE SHE REALIZED THE RESULT OF HER TREACHERY BUT LOOKED IN VAIN FOR THE OBJECT ON WHOM SHE HAD HOPED TO RECK THE STRENGTH OF HER INDIGNATION AND HER HATE WHERE WAS HE
AND WITH ALL THE BITTERNESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH HER COUNTENANCE WAS CAPABLE OF SHE SCOWLED UPON HIS UPRIGHT FIGURE AND HANDSOME FEATURES
LIKE HER WITH WHOM PROVIDENCE HAD SO OPPORTUNELY THROWN HIM TO REFORM HIM ALTOGETHER OF THOSE ROUGHER IDEAS WHICH HE HAD NATURALLY IMBIBED IN THE COURSE OF HIS PERILOUS AND DARING PROFESSION IN THE PRESENCE OF THAT FAIR AND PURE MINDED GIRL HE WAS AS A CHILD
NO I PRESUME NOT HE ANSWERED I MERELY ASK FROM ORDINARY PRECAUTION BUT WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO REVEAL TO ME SOMETHING TOUCHING THIS CAPTAIN RATLIN AY SAID THE GIRL QUICKLY IT IS OF HIM I WOULD SPEAK
CAPTAIN WILL RATLIN SEIZE HIM MY MEN SEIZE HIM AND BIND HIS ARMS HE IS OUR PRISONER SAID THE ENGLISH OFFICER BY WHAT AUTHORITY DO YOU GIVE SUCH AN ORDER AS THAT CAPTAIN BRAMBLE ASKED THE YOUNG COMMANDER IN THE QUEEN'S NAME SIR
HARD BY HER FATHER'S HOUSE YOU WILL SPEAK TRULY IN WHAT YOU TELL ME MY GOOD GIRL HE SAID SAGACIOUSLY AS HE LOOKED INTO HER DARK SPIRITED EYES WITH ADMIRATION HE COULD NOT AVOID HAVE I ANYTHING TO GAIN BY A LIE RESPONDED MAUD WITH A CURLING LIP
IF WE EXCEPT THE DAY BEFORE THE LATE ATTACK OF THE NEGROES UPON THE HOUSE WHEN THE SAME TREACHEROUS ASSUMPTION OF CHEERFULNESS AND SATISFACTION WITH ALL PARTIES WAS SIMILARLY ASSUMED CAPTAIN RATLIN ON HIS PART WAS EVER THE SAME
AND SO HE TOOK OCCASION TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND TO ADVISE THEM TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY TOUCHING THEIR OWN BEST COURSE IN ORDER TO SAFELY REACH ENGLAND THEY FELT THAT HIS ADVICE WAS GOOD AS TRULY DISINTERESTED
SEEMED SATISFIED AT A SINGLE GLANCE AS TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND WALKING UP TO THE YOUNG COMMANDER AND WATCHING FOR A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY WHEN NOT OVERHEARD HE ASKED SIGNIFICANTLY TREACHERY YES WHOM
THAT YOU ACCEPT MY WORD OF HONOR TO OBEY YOUR DIRECTIONS AS A PRISONER BUT THAT YOU SHALL NOT BIND MY ARMS OR CONFINE ME OTHERWISE HAVE YOUR OWN WAY REPLIED THE ENGLISHMAN DOGGEDLY BUT GIVE UP YOUR WEAPONS
HE DID LOVE THE LADY AND YET HIS SENTIMENT OF REGARD WAS SO MIXED UP WITH SELFISHNESS AND BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT AND PRIDE AT BEING REFUSED THAT THE SMALL GERM OF REAL AFFECTION WHICH HAD FOUND BIRTH IN HIS BOSOM WAS TOO MUCH CORRODED
FORTUNATE MY DEAR I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW ABOUT THAT HERE WE HAVE BEEN CONFINED AT THIS SLAVE FACTORY LITTLE BETTER THAN THE SLAVES THEMSELVES THESE FOUR WEEKS WELL MOTHER
UNDER PRETENCE THAT HE FEARED HIS PRISONER WOULD ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE HE KEPT HIM UNDER CLOSE GUARD
WHICH THOUGH IT AFFORDS FORTUNE AND COMMAND CAN NEVER PERMIT YOU SELF RESPECT THE SHIP WILL PROBABLY BE DESPATCHED WITHIN THESE TWO WEEKS AND THEN I WILL TAKE ANY BIRTH IN LEGITIMATE COMMERCE WHERE I MAY WIN AN HONORABLE NAME AND REPUTATION
THERE I HOPED TO SEE HIM FALL BUT HE WAS STRANGELY PRESERVED YOU ARE A SINGULAR GIRL MAUD REPLIED THE OFFICER TAKE THIS AND WEAR IT FOR MY SAKE HE ADDED
HAVING BEEN BROUGHT UP FROM CHILDHOOD UPON THE SEA HE HAD NEVER STUDIED THE MORALITY OF THE TRADE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW ENGAGED BUT THE NICE SENSE OF HONOR WHICH WAS SO STRONG A CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS NATURE ONLY REQUIRED THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF A SWEET AND REFINED NATURE
THE MEN WERE ALL WELL ARMED AND INSTRUCTED HOW TO ACT IN ANY POSSIBLE EMERGENCY THAT WAS TO BE MET WITH IN THE BUSINESS WHICH BROUGHT THEM ON SHORE ON THE WHOLE BODY PRESSED IN SILENCE THROUGH A TANGLED AND NARROW PATH
WHO WERE FITTING COMPANIONS FOR EACH OTHER BUT THEY HAD NOT AS YET BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER BY ANY CHANCE SO AS TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER WE REFER TO CAPTAIN BRAMBLE AND MAUD THE QUADROON BOTH NOW HATED CAPTAIN RATLIN
AND STROVE TO MAKE THEIR POSITION AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM WHILE THEY WERE ON BOARD BUT HE HAD NOT THE NICE SENSE OF HONOR THAT TRUE DELICACY OF SPIRIT WHICH SHOULD HAVE LED HIM TO REMEMBER THEY WERE HIS GUESTS FROM NECESSITY
AND THEN I'LL GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO YOUR CURIOSITY I DON'T CARE SAID SHE WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT FOR I HAVE AS MUCH AS I WANTED FROM HIM
SO MISSUS JEWKES IS RETURNED FROM HER VISIT WELL SAID SHE I WOULD HAVE YOU SET YOUR HEART AT REST FOR MISTER WILLIAMS WILL DO VERY WELL AGAIN HE IS NOT HALF SO BAD AS HE FANCIED O THESE SCHOLARS SAID SHE
AND BESIDES I SENT A LETTER AS YOU KNOW BUT HAVE HAD NO ANSWER TO IT SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT THAT HIS LETTER TO MISTER WILLIAMS WAS SUFFICIENT AND THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS TO THANK HIM IF BUT IN TWO LINES
HOWEVER SAID SHE ALL IS WELL NOW BECAUSE MY WATCHMENTS ARE NOW OVER BY MY MASTER'S DIRECTION HOW HAVE YOU EMPLOYED YOURSELF IN MY ABSENCE I WAS SO TROUBLED AT WHAT MIGHT HAVE PASSED BETWEEN MISTER WILLIAMS AND HER
BEING A CUNNING ARTFUL WOMAN I KNOW NOT WHAT TO MAKE OF IT I HAVE REFUSED HER ABSOLUTELY URGING THAT EXCEPT I INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE HIS SUIT I OUGHT NOT TO DO IT AND SHE IS GONE WITHOUT ME I HAVE
NO FORTUNE TO OUR DEAR CHILD BUT RATHER MUST BE A DISGRACE TO HER AS THE WORLD WILL THINK YET I HOPE I DO NOT SIN IN MY PRIDE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO GOOD MAN OF A COMMON DEGREE
MISTER WILLIAMS HAS BEEN HERE BUT WE HAVE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TOGETHER HE SEEMED CONFOUNDED AT MISSUS JEWKES'S CHANGE OF TEMPER AND RESERVEDNESS AFTER HER KIND VISIT
THAT I THOUGHT THERE WAS THE HIGHEST REASON TO RESUME OUR PROSPECT OF THE ESCAPE BY THE BACK DOOR I PUT THIS IN THE USUAL PLACE IN THE EVENING AND NOW WAIT WITH IMPATIENCE FOR AN ANSWER THURSDAY I HAVE THE FOLLOWING ANSWER
WELL SAID I LET HIM HAVE SAID WHAT HE WOULD I CARE NOT FOR I AM SURE HE CAN SAY NO HARM OF ME AND SO LET US CHANGE THE TALK I WAS THE EASIER INDEED BECAUSE FOR ALL HER PUMPS
IN THE SAME EXCELLENT COURSE AND WE SHALL NOT ENVY THE HIGHEST ESTATE BUT DEFY THEM TO PRODUCE SUCH A DAUGHTER AS OURS I SAID WE HAD NOT READ THROUGH ALL YOURS IN COURSE
AND TWO OR THREE LETTERS I HAD IN MY POCKETS BY GOOD FORTUNE THE LETTER MISSUS PAMELA GAVE ME WAS IN MY BOSOM AND SO THAT ESCAPED BUT THEY BRUISED MY HEAD AND FACE AND CURSING ME FOR HAVING NO MORE MONEY TIPPED ME INTO THE DAM
BUT TILL THEN IT IS NO MATTER HOW LITTLE YOU ARE TOGETHER THIS ALARMED US BOTH
SO HERE I AM AGAIN
AND I AM PERSUADED THAT FEAR BRINGS ONE INTO MORE DANGERS THAN THE CAUTION THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT DELIVERS ONE FROM I THEN LOCKED THE DOOR AND PUT THE KEY IN MY POCKET AND WAS IN A SAD QUANDARY
AND WHOLLY DIRECTED BY HIM ESPECIALLY AS MY FATHER WHOSE RESPECTS I MENTIONED HAD ASSURED ME MY MASTER WAS SETTING OUT FOR LONDON WHICH HE MUST HAVE SOMEHOW FROM HIS OWN FAMILY OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN ME WORD OF IT
IF IT BE I WILL LOSE NO TIME TO PROVIDE A HORSE FOR YOU AND ANOTHER FOR MYSELF FOR I CAN NEVER DO EITHER GOD OR MYSELF BETTER SERVICE THOUGH I WERE TO FOREGO ALL MY EXPECTATIONS FOR IT HERE I AM
THIS IS THE ACCOUNT HE GIVES OF IT TO MISSUS JEWKES GOOD MISSUS JEWKES I HAVE HAD A SORE MISFORTUNE IN GOING FROM YOU WHEN I HAD GOT AS NEAR THE TOWN AS THE DAM AND WAS GOING TO CROSS THE WOODEN BRIDGE
NOT AT ALL REPLIED SHE BUT I SUPPOSE YOU WILL SOON BE AT LIBERTY TO WALK TOGETHER AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE AND I HAVE SENT A MESSENGER FOR MY LAST INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT THIS AND MORE WEIGHTY MATTERS AND WHEN THEY COME
THOUGH MISSUS JEWKES IS SOMETIMES A LITTLE HARD UPON ME YET I KNOW NOT WHERE I AM WITHOUT HER I GO UP AND I COME DOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN THE GARDEN AND NOT HAVING HER KNOW SCARCELY WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF AY SAID THE IDEOT
O THIS WICKED WOMAN TO TRICK ME SO EVERY THING MAN WOMAN AND BEAST IS IN A PLOT AGAINST YOUR POOR PAMELA I THINK THEN I KNOW NOT ONE STEP OF THE WAY NOR HOW FAR TO ANY HOUSE OR COTTAGE
FOR MISSUS JEWKES GIVES ME LEAVE TO SEND A LETTER TO MY FATHER WHICH LOOKS WELL AND I AM GLAD I CAN CONCLUDE AFTER ALL MY SUFFERINGS WITH MY HOPES TO BE SOON WITH YOU WHICH I KNOW WILL GIVE YOU COMFORT AND SO I REST
AND I CAN MORE EASILY BE INDUCED WITH YOU WHEN ALL MY APPREHENSIONS ARE OVER TO CONSIDER HIS PROPOSAL OF MISTER WILLIAMS THAN I COULD HERE AND HE PRETENDS AS YOU HAVE READ IN HIS LETTER
SAID HE MAY NOT MISSUS PAMELA TAKE A WALK NO SAID SHE I DESIRE SHE WON'T WHY MISSUS JEWKES SAID HE I AM AFRAID I HAVE SOMEHOW DISOBLIGED YOU
BUT WHICH IS NOT COME TO MY HAND I THINK THERE CAN BE NO TREACHERY FOR IT IS A PARTICULAR FRIEND AT GAINSBOROUGH THAT I HAVE ORDERED HIM TO DIRECT TO AND THIS IS COME SAFE TO MY HANDS BY THIS MEANS
MONDAY MORNING ALAS A DAY WE HAVE BAD NEWS FROM POOR MISTER WILLIAMS HE HAS HAD A SAD MISCHANCE FALLEN AMONG ROGUES IN HIS WAY HOME LAST NIGHT BUT BY GOOD CHANCE HAS SAVED MY PAPERS
AS THEY ARE NOT THE EFFECT OF MY OWN VANITY OR PRESUMPTION BUT I WILL PROCEED WITH MY HOPELESS STORY I SAW MISTER WILLIAMS WAS A LITTLE NETTLED AT MY IMPATIENCE AND SO I WROTE TO ASSURE HIM I WOULD BE AS EASY AS I COULD
WHICH HAS ENABLED THEE TO WITHSTAND SO MANY TEMPTATIONS WE HAVE NOT YET HAD LEISURE TO READ THROUGH YOUR LONG ACCOUNTS OF ALL YOUR HARDSHIPS I SAY LONG BECAUSE I WONDER HOW YOU COULD FIND TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM
TO BE SURE THERE IS WITCHCRAFT IN THIS HOUSE AND I BELIEVE LUCIFER IS BRIBED AS WELL AS ALL ABOUT ME AND IS GOT INTO THE SHAPE OF THAT NASTY GRIM BULL TO WATCH ME FOR I HAVE BEEN AGAIN AND VENTURED TO OPEN THE DOOR
I ASSURED HER AS I COULD DO VERY SAFELY THAT THERE WAS NOT A MAN ON EARTH I WISHED TO HAVE AND AS TO MISTER WILLIAMS HE MIGHT DO BETTER BY FAR AND I HAD PROPOSED SO MUCH HAPPINESS IN LIVING WITH MY POOR FATHER AND MOTHER
EVERY THING GIVES ME ADDITIONAL DISTURBANCE THE MISSED LETTER OF JOHN ARNOLD'S MAKES ME SUSPECT A PLOT
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FORBORNE GIVING ME A TOUCH OF AND SO WE GAVE UP ONE ANOTHER AS DESPAIRING TO GAIN OUR ENDS OF EACH OTHER BUT I AM SURE HE MUST HAVE SAID MORE THAN HE SHOULD
THAT I COULD NOT HIDE IT AND SHE SAID WELL MISSUS PAMELA SINCE ALL MATTERS ARE LIKELY TO BE SO SOON AND SO HAPPILY ENDED LET ME ADVISE YOU TO BE A LITTLE LESS CONCERNED AT HIS DISCOVERIES AND MAKE ME YOUR CONFIDANT
THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE SCRUPLED TO HAVE PROCURED YOUR DELIVERANCE BY ANY MEANS AND THAT I HAD PROPOSED TO YOU AS THE ONLY HONOURABLE ONE MARRIAGE WITH ME BUT I ASSURED HER THOUGH SHE WOULD HARDLY BELIEVE ME
PRAY DEAREST MADAM LAY ASIDE YOUR FEARS AND WAIT A FEW DAYS FOR THE ISSUE OF MISSUS JEWKES'S LETTER AND MINE OF THANKS TO MISTER B THINGS I HOPE MUST BE BETTER THAN YOU EXPECT
YOUR MOST FAITHFUL HUMBLE SERVANT
AS HE HAS DONE AND I SHALL THINK YOU HAVE SOME FAVOUR FOR ME AND RELIANCE UPON ME AND PERHAPS YOU MIGHT NOT REPENT IT SHE WAS SO EARNEST THAT I MISTRUSTED SHE DID THIS TO PUMP ME AND I KNEW HOW
BEGGING THE CONTINUANCE OF YOUR PRAYERS AND BLESSINGS YOUR EVER DUTIFUL DAUGHTER MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER
WITHOUT ANY APPARENT REASON FROM A CONDUCT SO VERY CONTRARY BID ME FEAR THE WORST BLAME ME SIR IF YOU THINK ME WRONG AND LET ME HAVE YOUR ADVICE WHAT TO DO WHICH WILL OBLIGE
ESPECIALLY AS YOUR LATE LADY'S KINDNESS GAVE YOU SUCH GOOD OPPORTUNITIES WHICH YOU HAVE HAD THE GRACE TO IMPROVE BUT MAY THINK HIMSELF HAPPY IN YOU
STRANGE TEMPTATIONS TO GET AWAY IN HER ABSENCE FOR ALL THESE FINE APPEARANCES TIS SAD TO HAVE NOBODY TO ADVISE WITH I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO BUT ALAS FOR ME I HAVE NO MONEY IF I SHOULD
I AM MORE AND MORE SATISFIED THERE IS MISCHIEF BREWING AND SHALL BEGIN TO HIDE MY PAPERS AND BE CIRCUMSPECT
BUT IT IS NOT CANNOT BE IN HIM I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM JOHN ARNOLD IN WHICH HE TELLS ME THAT HIS MASTER IS PREPARING FOR HIS LONDON JOURNEY AND BELIEVES AFTERWARDS HE WILL COME INTO THESE PARTS
AND IS TO ACCOMPANY HER BROTHER TO LONDON OR MEET HIM THERE HE KNOWS NOT WHICH HE PROFESSES GREAT ZEAL AND AFFECTION TO YOUR SERVICE
AND BEING SO POOR AND SO FRIENDLESS O GOOD GOD THE PRESERVER OF THE INNOCENT DIRECT ME WHAT TO DO
SATURDAY SUNDAY MISTER WILLIAMS HAS BEEN HERE BOTH THESE DAYS AS USUAL BUT IS VERY INDIFFERENTLY RECEIVED STILL BY MISSUS JEWKES AND TO AVOID SUSPICION I LEFT THEM TOGETHER
AND WAS CONTRIVING BETWEEN YOU TWO THIS ALARMED ME PRODIGIOUSLY AND THE RATHER AS I SAW BY TWO OR THREE INSTANCES THAT HIS HONEST HEART COULD KEEP NOTHING BELIEVING EVERY ONE AS UNDESIGNING AS HIMSELF
AS TO SUPPOSE EVERY ONE IN A PLOT AGAINST ME
O MY FOOLISH FEARS OF BULLS AND ROBBERS FOR NOW ALL MY UNEASINESS BEGINS TO DOUBLE UPON ME O WHAT HAS THIS INCAUTIOUS MAN SAID THAT NO DOUBT IS THE SUBJECT OF HER LONG LETTER
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS WITCHES AND SPIRITS IF THERE BE I BELIEVE IN MY HEART MISSUS JEWKES HAS GOT THIS BULL OF HER SIDE BUT YET WHAT COULD I DO WITHOUT MONEY OR A FRIEND'
TO BUY ANY BODY'S CIVILITIES OR TO PAY FOR NECESSARIES OR LODGINGS BUT I'LL GO INTO THE GARDEN AND RESOLVE AFTERWARDS I HAVE BEEN IN THE GARDEN AND TO THE BACK DOOR AND THERE I STOOD
THOUGH WITH GREAT PAIN AS I DO THIS TO BE SURE THIS GOOD MAN CAN KEEP NO SECRET AND SENDING IT AWAY BY A MAN AND HORSE THIS MORNING I AM GOOD MISSUS JEWKES YOUR MOST OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT
AND YOUR MASTER'S HEART TURNED TO SEE THE FOLLY OF HIS WAYS AND THE INJURY HE HAD INTENDED TO OUR DEAR CHILD FOR TO BE SURE MY DEAR HE WOULD HAVE RUINED YOU IF HE COULD BUT SEEING YOUR VIRTUE HIS HEART IS TOUCHED
AND RETIRED TO MY CLOSET TO WRITE A LETTER FOR THE TILES
AND RECEIVE FROM YOUR OWN LIPS THE BLESSINGS OF SUCH GOOD PARENTS BUT ALAS HOW ARE MY PROSPECTS AGAIN OVERCLOUDED TO WHAT THEY WERE WHEN I CLOSED MY LAST PARCEL
THEY HAVE NOT THE HEARTS OF MICE HE HAS ONLY A FEW SCRATCHES ON HIS FACE WHICH SAID SHE I SUPPOSE HE GOT BY GRAPPLING AMONG THE GRAVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DAM TO TRY TO FIND A HOLE IN THE GROUND TO HIDE HIMSELF FROM THE ROBBERS
YOUR MOST FAITHFUL HUMBLE SERVANT I WAS TOO FREE INDEED WITH MISSUS JEWKES LED TO IT BY HER DISSIMULATION AND BY HER PRETENDED CONCERN TO MAKE ME HAPPY WITH YOU I HINTED
DILIGENT SEARCH IS MAKING AFTER THE ROGUES MY HUMBLE RESPECTS TO GOOD MISSUS PAMELA IF SHE PITIES MY MISFORTUNES I SHALL BE THE SOONER WELL
HE WILL LEAVE ME TO MY CHOICE WHY THEN SHOULD I BE AFRAID I WILL GO DOWN AGAIN I THINK BUT YET MY HEART MISGIVES ME BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES BEFORE ME IN ESCAPING
AND HERE IS THE BULL IT HAS AS EFFECTUALLY FRIGHTENED ME AS IF I HAD BEEN HURT BY IT INSTEAD OF THE COOK MAID AND SO THESE JOINED TOGETHER AS I MAY SAY TO MAKE A VERY DASTARD OF ME
OF SEEING YOU WITH US WHICH GOD GRANT AMEN AMEN SAY YOUR MOST INDULGENT PARENTS AMEN OUR HUMBLEST SERVICE AND THANKS TO THE WORTHY MISTER WILLIAMS AGAIN WE SAY
MY HEART UP AT MY MOUTH I COULD NOT SEE I WAS WATCHED SO THIS LOOKS WELL BUT IF ANY THING SHOULD GO BAD AFTERWARDS I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR NOT TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY WELL I WILL GO DOWN AGAIN
TO PART WITH ME FOR A BED FELLOW TILL YOU ARE SURE OF ONE YOU LIKE BETTER THIS CUT ME TO THE HEART AND AT THE SAME TIME STOPPED MY MOUTH TUESDAY WEDNESDAY
AH MISSUS JEWKES MISSUS JEWKES THIS MIGHT HAVE DONE WITH ME HAD HE HAD ANY THING THAT HE COULD HAVE TOLD YOU OF BUT
AND KNOW NOT HOW I GOT HOME I WILL WRITE A LETTER OF THANKS THIS NIGHT IF I AM ABLE TO MY KIND PATRON FOR HIS INESTIMABLE GOODNESS TO ME I WISH I WAS ENABLED TO SAY ALL I HOPE
AND WHETHER I COULD GAIN PROTECTION IF I GOT TO A HOUSE AND NOW THE ROBBERS ARE ABROAD TOO I MAY RUN INTO AS GREAT DANGER AS I WANT TO ESCAPE NAY GREATER MUCH IF THESE PROMISING APPEARANCES HOLD
AND YOU CAN PRAY FOR HER WITH HEARTS SO SINCERE AND PURE THAT ARE NOT TO BE MET WITH IN PALACES OH
I CANNOT HELP SAYING THAT I DON'T LIKE THIS THING AND THEIR TAKING HIS LETTERS MOST ALARMS ME HOW HAPPY IT WAS THEY MISSED MY PACKET I KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK OF IT BUT WHY SHOULD I LET EVERY ACCIDENT BREAK MY PEACE
AND SAW THE BULL AS I THOUGHT BETWEEN ME AND THE DOOR AND ANOTHER BULL COMING TOWARDS ME THE OTHER WAY WELL THOUGHT I HERE IS DOUBLE WITCHCRAFT TO BE SURE HERE IS THE SPIRIT OF MY MASTER IN ONE BULL
I THINK YOU ARE TOO APPREHENSIVE BY MUCH I AM SORRY FOR YOUR UNEASINESS YOU MAY DEPEND UPON ME AND ALL I CAN DO BUT I MAKE NO DOUBT OF THE LONDON JOURNEY NOR OF JOHN'S CONTRITION AND FIDELITY
AND SURE MY MASTER CANNOT BE SO BLACK AS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT WHAT CAN I DO I HAVE A GOOD MIND TO TRY FOR IT ONCE MORE BUT THEN I MAY BE PURSUED AND TAKEN AND IT WILL BE WORSE FOR ME
ONCE MORE I'LL VENTURE GOD DIRECT MY FOOTSTEPS AND MAKE SMOOTH MY PATH AND MY WAY TO SAFETY WELL HERE I AM COME BACK AGAIN FRIGHTENED LIKE A FOOL
AND SEE AN END TO ALL MY TROUBLES AND ANXIETIES FORGIVE MY IMPATIENCE BUT MY PRESAGING MIND BODES HORRID MISCHIEFS EVERY THING LOOKS DARK AROUND ME AND THIS WOMAN'S IMPENETRABLE SULLENNESS AND SILENCE
OR TO OFFER TO DIRECT YOU IN YOUR CHOICE BUT ALAS MY CHILD WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU TO PARTAKE OUR HARD LOT AND INVOLVE YOURSELF INTO AS HARD A LIFE WOULD NOT HELP US BUT ADD TO YOUR AFFLICTIONS
WHAT IS IT YOU CANNOT DO FOR YOUR CHILD YOU CAN GIVE HER THE ADVICE SHE HAS SO MUCH WANTED AND STILL WANTS AND WILL ALWAYS WANT YOU CAN CONFIRM HER IN THE PATHS OF VIRTUE INTO WHICH YOU FIRST INITIATED HER
IT LOOKED PROMISING SHE SAID I HEEDED NOT HER REFLECTIONS
SHE SHALL SEND A MESSENGER TO BEDFORDSHIRE AND HE SHALL CARRY A LETTER OF THANKS FOR ME IF I WILL WRITE IT FOR MY MASTER'S FAVOUR TO ME INDEED SAID I I HAVE NO THANKS TO GIVE TILL I AM WITH MY FATHER AND MOTHER
I WISH HE WAS AS GOOD BUT I HOPE HE WILL NOW REFORM
DEAREST MADAM I AM UTTERLY CONFOUNDED AND MUST PLEAD GUILTY TO ALL YOUR JUST REPROACHES I WISH I WERE MASTER OF ALL BUT HALF YOUR CAUTION AND DISCRETION I HOPE AFTER ALL
FOR WELL I KNOW I DURST TRUST NOTHING TO BRETT AT THE POST HOUSE HERE THIS GIVES ME A LITTLE PAIN BUT I HOPE ALL WILL END WELL AND WE SHALL SOON HEAR IF IT BE NECESSARY TO PURSUE OUR FORMER INTENTIONS
TO BOTH WHICH POINTS SHE RETURNED SUSPICIOUS ANSWERS SAYING AS TO THE ONE WHY YOU ARE MIGHTY EARNEST FOR YOUR MONEY I SHAN'T RUN AWAY WITH IT AND TO THE OTHER GOOD LACK YOU NEED NOT BE SO WILLING AS I KNOW OF
AND HE SEEMED TO TAKE ME AS I INTENDED INTIMATING THE RENEWING OF THE CORRESPONDENCE BY THE TILES
GOD BE PRAISED IT IS NO WORSE AND I FIND I HAVE GOT NO COLD THOUGH MISERABLY WET FROM TOP TO TOE MY FRIGHT I BELIEVE PREVENTED ME FROM CATCHING COLD FOR I WAS NOT RIGHTLY MYSELF FOR SOME HOURS
OUT OF ALL MY PURPOSES O HOW TERRIBLE EVERY THING APPEARS TO ME I HAD GOT TWICE AS FAR AGAIN
NO NEED OF IT SAID I FOR I DON'T INTEND TO HAVE MISTER WILLIAMS WHAT THEN IS THAT LETTER TO ME WELL SAID SHE I SEE THOU ART QUITE UNFATHOMABLE I DON'T LIKE ALL THIS
NOW TO ACCOUNT FOR HER KINDNESS TO MISTER WILLIAMS IN HER VISIT TO HIM WHICH WAS ONLY TO GET OUT OF HIM WHAT SHE COULD WHY MISSUS JEWKES SAID I IS ALL THIS FISHING ABOUT FOR SOMETHING WHERE THERE IS NOTHING
PROVIDENCE WILL NOT DESERT SUCH PIETY AND INNOCENCE AND BE THIS YOUR COMFORT AND RELIANCE
WE HAVE JUST SUPPED TOGETHER ALL THREE AND I CANNOT YET THINK THAT ALL MUST BE RIGHT ONLY I AM RESOLVED NOT TO MARRY IF I CAN HELP IT AND I WILL GIVE NO ENCOURAGEMENT I AM RESOLVED AT LEAST
THAT I COULD NOT THINK OF ANY SCHEME OF LIFE WITH PLEASURE TILL I HAD TRIED THAT I ASKED HER FOR MY MONEY AND SHE SAID IT WAS ABOVE IN HER STRONG BOX BUT THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT TO MORROW
BUT OTHERWISE THEY ARE THE DELIGHT OF OUR SPARE HOURS AND WE SHALL READ THEM OVER AND OVER AS LONG AS WE LIVE WITH THANKFULNESS TO GOD WHO HAS GIVEN US SO VIRTUOUS AND SO DISCREET A DAUGHTER
AND SHE PULLED OUT HER KEY AND WE WALKED A LITTLE IN THE PASTURE TO LOOK AT THE BULL
FAR BE IT FROM US TO OFFER VIOLENCE TO YOUR INCLINATION SO MUCH PRUDENCE AS YOU HAVE SHEWN IN ALL YOUR CONDUCT
HE SAYS IN HIS LETTER HE WAS A FRIGHTFUL SPECTACLE HE MIGHT BE SO INDEED WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN A DOORS BUT HE LOOKS WELL ENOUGH NOW AND ONLY FOR A FEW GROANS NOW AND THEN WHEN HE THINKS OF HIS DANGER
I HAVE JUST PUT UNDER THE TILES THESE LINES INSPIRED BY MY FEARS WHICH ARE INDEED VERY STRONG AND I DOUBT NOT WITHOUT REASON SIR
WITH REGARD TO THE BETTER PART OF HIS BOUNTY TO ME INCOMPARABLE MISSUS PAMELA THE WICKED BRUTE FELL A LAUGHING WHEN SHE HAD READ THIS LETTER TILL HER FAT SIDES SHOOK SAID SHE
THAT HURT THE POOR COOK MAID WHO IS GOT PRETTY WELL AGAIN MISTER WILLIAMS POINTED AT THE SUNFLOWER BUT I WAS FORCED TO BE VERY RESERVED TO HIM FOR THE POOR GENTLEMAN HAS NO GUARD NO CAUTION AT ALL
TO HELP MYSELF ANY WHERE ELSE O WHY ARE POOR FOOLISH MAIDENS TRIED WITH SUCH DANGERS WHEN THEY HAVE SUCH WEAK MINDS TO GRAPPLE WITH THEM I WILL SINCE IT IS SO HOPE THE BEST
I BEGIN TO WISH I HAD VENTURED EVERY THING AND GONE OFF WHEN I MIGHT O WHEN WILL THIS STATE OF DOUBT AND UNEASINESS END SHE HAS JUST BEEN WITH ME AND SAYS
SHE HAS NOW BEEN ACTUALLY THESE TWO HOURS SHUT UP A WRITING THOUGH SHE PRETENDED SHE HAD GIVEN ME UP ALL HER STORES OF PAPERS ET CETERA AND THAT I SHOULD WRITE FOR HER
BUT THERE STOOD THAT HORRID BULL STARING ME FULL IN THE FACE WITH FIERY SAUCER EYES AS I THOUGHT SO I GOT IN AGAIN FOR FEAR HE SHOULD COME AT ME NOBODY SAW ME HOWEVER
AND TRUST TO PROVIDENCE TO GUIDE HIM FOR MY SAFEGUARD FOR I WOULD NOT ENDANGER YOU NOW JUST UPON THE EDGE OF YOUR PREFERMENT YET SIR I FEAR YOUR FATAL OPENNESS WILL MAKE YOU SUSPECTED AS ACCESSARY
AND WITHOUT A HAT AND WIG WHEN HE GOT HOME I WARRANT ADDED SHE
BUT AS EVERY THING IS SO FRIGHTFUL TO ME I FIND I AM NOT FIT TO THINK OF MY ESCAPE
I WILL GIVE YOU THE SUBSTANCE ONLY I EXPOSTULATED WITH HIM ON HIS TOO GREAT OPENNESS AND EASINESS
AND SHE RETURNED THE LESS THE BETTER POOR MAN HE HAS GOT BUT LITTLE BY HIS OPENNESS MAKING MISSUS JEWKES HIS CONFIDANT AS SHE BRAGGED
MY SOUL IS OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE WITH THE SOUL OF A PRINCESS THOUGH MY QUALITY IS INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE MEANEST SLAVE SAVE THEN MY INNOCENCE GOOD HEAVEN AND PRESERVE MY MIND SPOTLESS
AND THEIR FREEDOM WITH ONE ANOTHER AND MUCH MORE AT WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU HE ASKED IF I WOULD TAKE A TURN IN THE GARDEN WITH MISSUS JEWKES AND HIM NO SAID SHE I CAN'T GO
I TOLD HER I WAS RESOLVED TO GIVE NO ENCOURAGEMENT TILL I HAD TALKED TO MY FATHER AND MOTHER SHE SAID HE FANCIED I THOUGHT OF SOMEBODY ELSE OR I COULD NEVER BE SO INSENSIBLE
GOD BLESS HIM FOR EVER O WHAT A DEAL WE HAVE TO SAY TO YOU GOD GIVE US A HAPPY MEETING WE UNDERSTAND THE SQUIRE IS SETTING OUT FOR LONDON HE IS A FINE GENTLEMAN AND HAS WIT AT WILL
BUT PRAY DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM AS I SAID FOR HE IS MUCH TOO HEADY AND PRECIPITATE AS TO THIS MATTER IN MY WAY OF THINKING THOUGH TO BE SURE HE IS A VERY GOOD MAN AND I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM
I SAID I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BARBAROUS TO LAUGH AT SUCH A MISFORTUNE BUT SHE REPLIED AS HE WAS SAFE SHE LAUGHED OTHERWISE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY AND SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE ME SO CONCERNED FOR HIM
BUT IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO TALK OF THESE THINGS
SHE GAVE NO HINTS OF THE KEY AND THE DOOR ET CETERA
MISSUS JEWKES CONTINUES STILL SULLEN AND ILL NATURED AND I AM ALMOST AFRAID TO SPEAK TO HER SHE WATCHES ME AS CLOSE AS EVER AND PRETENDS TO WONDER WHY I SHUN HER COMPANY AS I DO
THAT HAD WE BEEN DISPOSED WE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY FOR IT FROM YOUR WATCHFUL CARE AND CIRCUMSPECTION NO SAID SHE THAT'S VERY TRUE MISSUS PAMELA NOT SO MUCH AS FOR THAT DECLARATION THAT HE OWNED BEFORE ME
HE HAD FOUND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL MY WATCHFULNESS TO MAKE YOU COME COME SAID SHE NO MORE OF THESE SHAMS WITH ME YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT HEAD PIECE FOR YOUR YEARS BUT MAY BE I AM AS CUNNING AS YOU
THAT YOU DISCOURAGED MY APPLICATION WHICH IS TOO TRUE
BUT MY FOLLY WAS THE WORST OF ALL BECAUSE THAT DEPRIVED ME OF MY MONEY FOR HAD I HAD THAT I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE VENTURED BOTH THE BULL AND THE ROBBERS MONDAY AFTERNOON
FOR THERE WAS NEVER WORSHIPFUL MAN OR WORSHIPFUL WOMAN BUT THEY LOVED ONE BETTER THAN ANOTHER AND WORSHIP IN ARMS MAY NEVER BE FOILED BUT FIRST RESERVE THE HONOUR TO GOD AND SECONDLY THE QUARREL MUST COME OF THY LADY AND SUCH LOVE I CALL VIRTUOUS LOVE
THEN CAME KING ARTHUR WITH HIS NINE KNIGHTS WITH HIM AND SIR LAUNCELOT ENCOUNTERED WITH SIR GAWAINE AND GAVE HIM SUCH A BUFFET THAT THE ARSON OF HIS SADDLE BRAST AND SIR GAWAINE FELL TO THE EARTH THEN SIR GARETH ENCOUNTERED WITH THE GOOD KNIGHT SIR PALOMIDES
HERE THEN UPON THIS DESOLATE SHORE WE ABANDONED OURSELVES TO OUR FATE FOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF SCALING THE MOUNTAIN AND IF A SHIP HAD APPEARED IT COULD ONLY HAVE SHARED OUR DOOM THE FIRST THING OUR CAPTAIN DID WAS TO DIVIDE EQUALLY AMONGST US ALL THE FOOD WE POSSESSED
RICH TABLE AND SOFT BED
OF SERENDIB WHERE THE NATIVES PRESENTED ME TO THEIR KING WHOM I SALUTED IN THE INDIAN FASHION PROSTRATING MYSELF AT HIS FEET AND KISSING THE GROUND BUT THE MONARCH BADE ME RISE AND SIT BESIDE HIM ASKING FIRST
ON THE DARK RIND OF ALBA'S OAKS TO DAY NO AXE IS RINGING THE YOKE HANGS O'ER THE MANGER THE SCYTHE LIES IN THE HAY THROUGH ALL THE ALBAN VILLAGES NO WORK IS DONE
AFTER I HAD SALUTED HIM THE CALIPH SAID I HAVE SENT FOR YOU SINDBAD BECAUSE I NEED YOUR SERVICES
NEVER AGAIN TO LEAVE BAGDAD WITH THIS I GAVE HIM A LONG ACCOUNT OF SOME OF MY STRANGEST ADVENTURES TO WHICH HE LISTENED PATIENTLY I ADMIT SAID HE THAT YOU HAVE INDEED HAD SOME EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES
AND TO YOURSELF GREAT WORSHIP AND ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE SAID KING ARTHUR UNTO SIR GARETH WIT YOU WELL I SHALL LOVE YOU AND TRUST YOU THE MORE BETTER FOR EVER SAID ARTHUR IT IS A WORSHIPFUL KNIGHT'S DEED TO HELP ANOTHER WORSHIPFUL KNIGHT WHEN HE SEETH HIM IN A GREAT DANGER
IT WERE SHAME TO US SO MANY AS WE BE TO SET UPON THEM ANY MORE FOR WIT YE WELL SAID KING ARTHUR THEY BE THREE GOOD KNIGHTS AND NAMELY THAT KNIGHT WITH THE SLEEVE OF GOLD SO THEN THEY BLEW UNTO LODGING
CAPYS CAPYS THE SIGHTLESS SEER FROM HEAD TO FOOT HE TREMBLED AS ROMULUS DREW NEAR AND UP STOOD STIFF HIS THIN WHITE HAIR AND HIS BLIND EYES FLASHED FIRE
HEAVEN FORBID THAT I SHOULD COVET YOUR RICHES I WILL RATHER ADD TO THEM FOR I DESIRE THAT YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE MY KINGDOM WITHOUT SOME TOKENS OF MY GOOD WILL HE THEN COMMANDED HIS OFFICERS
AND NOW MY TASK BEING ACCOMPLISHED I WAS ANXIOUS TO DEPART
AND TO HIM SIR GARETH RODE AND PRAYED HIM OF HIS KNIGHTHOOD TO LEND HIM HIS SHIELD FOR HIS I WILL WELL SAID THE WELSH KNIGHT AND WHEN SIR GARETH HAD HIS SHIELD THE BOOK SAITH IT WAS GREEN WITH A MAIDEN THAT SEEMED IN IT
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE HOW SIR LAUNCELOT BEHAVED HIM AT THE JOUSTS AND OTHER MEN ALSO
AND SMOOTHED HIS YELLOW FOAM AND GENTLY ROCKED THE CRADLE THAT BORE THE FATE OF ROME THE RAVENING SHE WOLF KNEW THEM
YOU ALONE HAVE ESCAPED THE WILES OF THESE ANIMALS THEREFORE YOU MUST BE UNDER THE SPECIAL PROTECTION OF HEAVEN NOW THROUGH YOU THE WHOLE TOWN WILL BE ENRICHED WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF LIFE THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT ONLY RECEIVE YOUR LIBERTY BUT I WILL ALSO BESTOW A FORTUNE UPON YOU
IT MUST BE A MARVEL TO YOU HOW AFTER HAVING FIVE TIMES MET WITH SHIPWRECK AND UNHEARD OF PERILS I COULD AGAIN TEMPT FORTUNE AND RISK FRESH TROUBLE
LARGE AND OF PERFECT SHAPE AND LUSTRE SECONDLY A HUGE SNAKE SKIN WITH SCALES AS LARGE AS A SEQUIN WHICH WOULD PRESERVE FROM SICKNESS THOSE WHO SLEPT UPON IT THEN QUANTITIES OF ALOES WOOD CAMPHOR AND PISTACHIO NUTS
THE KING OF THE INDIES BEFORE WHOM WALK A THOUSAND ELEPHANTS WHO LIVES IN A PALACE OF WHICH THE ROOF BLAZES WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND RUBIES AND WHOSE TREASURE HOUSE CONTAINS TWENTY THOUSAND DIAMOND CROWNS TO THE CALIPH HAROUN AL RASCHID SENDS GREETING
WHO REIGNED IN ALBA LONGA ON THE THRONE OF AVENTINE SLAIN IS THE PONFIFF CAMERS WHO SPAKE THE WORDS OF DOOM THE CHILDREN TO THE TIBER THE MOTHER
AND WHEN I WENT TO EXAMINE IT MORE CLOSELY I FOUND THAT INSIDE THE CAVE THE WALLS WERE THICK WITH DIAMONDS AND RUBIES AND MASSES OF CRYSTAL AND THE FLOOR WAS STREWN WITH AMBERGRIS
IT STRUCK ME AS A VERY STRANGE THING THAT A RIVER OF CLEAR FRESH WATER WHICH GUSHED OUT FROM THE MOUNTAIN NOT FAR FROM WHERE WE STOOD INSTEAD OF FLOWING INTO THE SEA AS RIVERS GENERALLY DO TURNED OFF SHARPLY AND FLOWED OUT OF SIGHT UNDER A NATURAL ARCHWAY OF ROCK
ON THE LEFT SIDE GOES REMUS WITH WRISTS AND FINGERS RED AND IN HIS HAND A BOAR SPEAR AND ON THE POINT A HEAD A WRINKLED HEAD AND AGED WITH SILVER BEARD AND HAIR AND HOLY FILLETS ROUND IT
THEN SIR LAUNCELOT HURTLED HERE AND THERE AND RACED AND PULLED OFF HELMS SO THAT AT THAT TIME THERE MIGHT NONE SIT HIM A BUFFET WITH SPEAR NOR WITH SWORD AND SIR GARETH DID SUCH DEEDS OF ARMS THAT ALL MEN MARVELLED WHAT KNIGHT HE WAS WITH THE GREEN SHIELD
THAT IS THE GOOD AND GENTLE KNIGHT SIR LAVAINE SAID SIR BORS SO SIR LAUNCELOT ENCOUNTERED WITH SIR GAWAINE AND THERE BY FORCE SIR LAUNCELOT SMOTE DOWN SIR GAWAINE AND HIS HORSE TO THE EARTH AND SO HE SMOTE DOWN SIR AGRAVAINE AND SIR GAHERIS
THOUGH THE OFFERING WE PRESENT TO YOU IS UNWORTHY OF YOUR NOTICE WE PRAY YOU TO ACCEPT IT AS A MARK OF THE ESTEEM AND FRIENDSHIP WHICH WE CHERISH FOR YOU
WHO POSSESSES TWENTY THOUSAND DIAMOND CROWNS BEHOLD A MONARCH GREATER THAN SOLOMON AND MIHRAGE IN ALL THEIR GLORY THEN THE ONE WHO STANDS BEHIND THE THRONE ANSWERS
AND ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM RIDE HIS MINISTERS HIS FAVOURITES AND COURTIERS ON HIS ELEPHANT'S NECK SITS AN OFFICER HIS GOLDEN LANCE IN HIS HAND AND BEHIND HIM STANDS ANOTHER BEARING A PILLAR OF GOLD AT THE TOP OF WHICH IS AN EMERALD AS LONG AS MY HAND
AND THEN THE LENGTH OF EACH MAN'S LIFE DEPENDED ON THE TIME HE COULD MAKE HIS PORTION LAST I MYSELF COULD LIVE UPON VERY LITTLE NEVERTHELESS
AH POOR SINDBAD HE CRIED I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD HAVE BECOME OF YOU WHEN I WENT TO THE FOREST I FOUND THE TREE NEWLY UPROOTED AND THE ARROWS LYING BESIDE IT AND I FEARED I SHOULD NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN PRAY
GRAMERCY SAID SIR LAUNCELOT SIR SAID SIR GARETH ENCOUNTER YE WITH SIR GAWAINE AND I SHALL ENCOUNTER WITH SIR PALOMIDES AND LET SIR LAVAINE MATCH WITH THE NOBLE KING ARTHUR AND WHEN WE HAVE DELIVERED THEM LET US THREE HOLD US SADLY TOGETHER
THAT LUSTY MONTH OF MAY IN SOMETHING TO CONSTRAIN HIM TO SOME MANNER OF THING MORE IN THAT MONTH THAN IN ANY OTHER MONTH FOR DIVERS CAUSES FOR THEN ALL HERBS AND TREES RENEW A MAN AND WOMAN
BEFORE I WAS ONCE MORE SET UPON MY FEET BY THE ELEPHANT AND I STOOD AS IF IN A DREAM WATCHING THE HERD
THEY BE NOT ABOUT YOU IT IS FOR SOME CAUSE SAID SIR GAWAINE BY MY HEAD SAID SIR KAY SIR BORS IS YONDER ALL THIS DAY UPON THE RIGHT HAND OF THIS FIELD AND THERE HE AND HIS BLOOD DO MORE WORSHIPFULLY THAN WE DO
AFTER THANKING HIM FOR THE HONOUR THAT HE DID ME I DISPLAYED THE CALIPH'S GIFTS FIRST A BED WITH COMPLETE HANGINGS ALL CLOTH OF GOLD WHICH COST A THOUSAND SEQUINS AND ANOTHER LIKE TO IT OF CRIMSON STUFF FIFTY ROBES OF RICH EMBROIDERY
FOR THEE NO SHIP BRINGS PRECIOUS BALES ACROSS THE LIBYAN BRINE THOU SHALT NOT DRINK FROM AMBER THOU SHALT NOT REST ON DOWN
AND MAKING PRISONERS OF THOSE WHO WERE PRUDENT ENOUGH TO SUBMIT AT ONCE OF WHOM I WAS ONE WHEN THEY HAD DESPOILED US OF ALL WE POSSESSED THEY FORCED US TO PUT ON VILE RAIMENT AND SAILING TO A DISTANT ISLAND THERE SOLD US FOR SLAVES
AND SO WE PARTED I LEFT THE SHIP AT THE FIRST PORT WE CAME TO NOT FEELING AT EASE UPON THE SEA AFTER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME BY REASON OF IT AND HAVING DISPOSED OF MY IVORY FOR MUCH GOLD AND BOUGHT MANY RARE AND COSTLY PRESENTS
AND THEN WERE THEY HORSED AGAIN AND THEN MET SIR LAUNCELOT WITH SIR PALOMIDES AND THERE SIR PALOMIDES HAD A FALL AND SO SIR LAUNCELOT OR EVER HE STINT AS FAST AS HE MIGHT GET SPEARS HE SMOTE DOWN THIRTY KNIGHTS
FOR IN MANY PERSONS THERE IS NO STABILITY FOR WE MAY SEE ALL DAY FOR A LITTLE BLAST OF WINTER'S RASURE ANON WE SHALL DEFACE AND LAY APART TRUE LOVE FOR LITTLE OR NOUGHT THAT COST MUCH THING THIS IS NO WISDOM NOR STABILITY
AS TO MY ADVENTURE AMONG THE ELEPHANTS HE HEARD IT WITH AMAZEMENT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT HAD NOT MY TRUTHFULNESS BEEN WELL KNOWN TO HIM BY HIS ORDERS THIS STORY AND THE OTHERS I HAD TOLD HIM WERE WRITTEN BY HIS SCRIBES IN LETTERS OF GOLD AND LAID UP AMONG HIS TREASURES
I TOOK MY LEAVE OF HIM WELL SATISFIED WITH THE HONOURS AND REWARDS HE BESTOWED UPON ME AND SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE RESTED FROM MY LABOURS AND GIVEN MYSELF UP WHOLLY TO MY FAMILY AND MY FRIENDS THUS SINDBAD ENDED THE STORY OF HIS SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE
WHOM WOMAN'S MILK HAVE FED THOU WAST NOT MADE FOR LUCRE FOR PLEASURE NOR FOR REST
AND GAVE THEM OF HER OWN FIERCE MILK RICH WITH RAW FLESH AND GORE TWENTY WINTERS TWENTY SPRINGS SINCE THEN HAVE ROLLED AWAY AND TO DAY THE DEAD ARE LIVING
TO WHOM AFTER I HAD MADE MY OBEISANCE I GAVE THE LETTER AND THE KING'S GIFT AND WHEN HE HAD EXAMINED THEM HE DEMANDED OF ME WHETHER THE PRINCE OF SERENDIB WAS REALLY AS RICH AND POWERFUL AS HE CLAIMED TO BE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I REPLIED
AND SIR GALAHAD THE HAUT PRINCE
NEITHER CAPTAIN NOR PILOT KNEW WHERE WE WERE NOR WHERE WE WERE GOING WHEN THEY DID AT LAST DISCOVER OUR POSITION WE HAD SMALL GROUND FOR REJOICING FOR THE CAPTAIN CASTING HIS TURBAN UPON THE DECK AND TEARING HIS BEARD
THEN RECOVERING MYSELF I LOOKED ABOUT ME AND FOUND THAT I WAS STANDING UPON THE SIDE OF A GREAT HILL STREWN AS FAR AS I COULD SEE ON EITHER HAND WITH BONES AND TUSKS OF ELEPHANTS
THE HEAD OF ANCIENT CAMERS WHO SPAKE THE WORDS OF DOOM THE CHILDREN TO THE TIBER THE MOTHER
THE MOUNTAIN FORMED THE SEAWARD BOUNDARY OF A LARGE ISLAND AND THE NARROW STRIP OF ROCKY SHORE UPON WHICH WE STOOD WAS STREWN WITH THE WRECKAGE OF A THOUSAND GALLANT SHIPS WHILE THE BONES OF THE LUCKLESS MARINERS SHONE WHITE IN THE SUNSHINE
I WARN YOU BEWARE OF HIM WITH THE SLEEVE OF GOLD UPON HIS HEAD FOR HE IS HIMSELF SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAKE AND FOR GREAT GOODNESS SIR BORS WARNED SIR GARETH I AM WELL APAID SAID SIR GARETH THAT I MAY KNOW HIM
AND THEN KING ARTHUR WAS WOOD WROTH AND RAN TO THE KING WITH THE HUNDRED KNIGHTS AND THERE KING ARTHUR SMOTE HIM DOWN AND AFTER WITH THAT SAME SPEAR KING ARTHUR SMOTE DOWN THREE OTHER KNIGHTS AND THEN WHEN HIS SPEAR WAS BROKEN
REGARDLESS OF THE ENTREATIES OF MY FRIENDS AND RELATIONS WHO DID ALL THEY COULD TO KEEP ME AT HOME
OF BROADSWORD AND OF SHIELD HE LOVES TO DRINK THE STEAM THAT REEKS FROM THE FRESH BATTLEFIELD HE SMILES A SMILE MORE DREADFUL
FOR THEN EVER WILL A COWARD SHOW NO MERCY AND ALWAYS A GOOD MAN WILL DO EVER TO ANOTHER MAN AS HE WOULD BE DONE TO HIMSELF SO THEN THERE WERE GREAT FEASTS UNTO KINGS AND DUKES AND REVEL GAME AND PLAY AND ALL MANNER OF NOBLESSE WAS USED
ONCE OUT IN THE CURRENT MY RAFT FLEW SWIFTLY UNDER THE GLOOMY ARCHWAY AND I FOUND MYSELF IN TOTAL DARKNESS CARRIED SMOOTHLY FORWARD BY THE RAPID RIVER ON I WENT AS IT SEEMED TO ME FOR MANY NIGHTS AND DAYS
WEDGED CLOSE WITH SHIELD AND SPEAR AND THE RANKS OF FALSE TARENTUM ARE GLITTERING
AND TOOK A LITTLE HACKNEY AND RODE AFTER SIR LAUNCELOT FOR EVER HE HAD A SPY UPON HIM
NOW WE ARE HERE WE MAY AS WELL BEGIN TO DIG OUR GRAVES AT ONCE SINCE FROM THIS FATAL SPOT NO SHIPWRECKED MARINER HAS EVER RETURNED THIS SPEECH DISCOURAGED US MUCH AND WE BEGAN TO LAMENT OVER OUR SAD FATE
THAT I PRAISED HIS GENEROSITY AND GAVE HIM GRATEFUL THANKS NOR DID I FAIL TO PRESENT MYSELF DAILY IN HIS AUDIENCE CHAMBER
AND ON THE ONE SIDE SIR BORS SIR ECTOR DE MARIS SIR LIONEL SIR LAMORAK DE GALIS SIR BLEOBERIS SIR GALIHUD SIR GALIHODIN SIR PELLEAS AND WITH MO OTHER OF KING BAN'S BLOOD FOUGHT UPON ANOTHER PARTY AND HELD THE KING WITH THE HUNDRED KNIGHTS
SO I STAYED WITH HIM TILL THE TIME OF THE MONSOON AND EVERY DAY WE ADDED TO OUR STORE OF IVORY TILL ALL HIS WARE HOUSES WERE OVERFLOWING WITH IT BY THIS TIME THE OTHER MERCHANTS KNEW THE SECRET BUT THERE WAS ENOUGH AND TO SPARE FOR ALL
TO WHICH I REPLIED MASTER I THANK YOU AND WISH YOU ALL PROSPERITY FOR MYSELF I ONLY ASK LIBERTY TO RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY IT IS WELL HE ANSWERED THE MONSOON WILL SOON BRING THE IVORY SHIPS HITHER THEN I WILL SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY WITH SOMEWHAT TO PAY YOUR PASSAGE
WHOSOMEVER USETH THIS THEREFORE LIKE AS MAY MONTH FLOWERETH AND FLOURISHETH IN MANY GARDENS SO IN LIKE WISE LET EVERY MAN OF WORSHIP FLOURISH HIS HEART IN THIS WORLD FIRST UNTO GOD AND NEXT UNTO THE JOY OF THEM THAT HE PROMISED HIS FAITH UNTO
THE ISLAND OF SERENDIB BEING SITUATED ON THE EQUINOCTIAL LINE THE DAYS AND NIGHTS THERE ARE OF EQUAL LENGTH THE CHIEF CITY IS PLACED AT THE END OF A BEAUTIFUL VALLEY FORMED BY THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLAND
WHICH WAS ALWAYS BRINGING ME INTO SUCH STRAITS AND THOUGHT LONGINGLY OF ALL THE COMFORT AND LUXURY THAT I HAD LEFT BUT LUCKILY FOR ME
AND SO THE KING WITH THESE NINE KNIGHTS MADE THEM READY TO SET UPON SIR LAUNCELOT AND UPON SIR LAVAINE
A GLORIOUS CITY THOU SHALT BUILD AND NAME IT BY THY NAME AND THERE UNQUENCHED THROUGH AGES
LIKE HUNTED SHEEP SHALL FLY
I ACCEPTED THE CHARGE RESPECTFULLY AND SOON EMBARKED UPON THE VESSEL WHICH THE KING HIMSELF HAD CHOSEN FOR ME THE KING'S LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN BLUE CHARACTERS UPON A RARE AND PRECIOUS SKIN OF YELLOWISH COLOUR AND THESE WERE THE WORDS OF IT
THOUGH I ONLY ATE WHAT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO KEEP MYSELF ALIVE THE INEVITABLE MOMENT CAME WHEN AFTER SWALLOWING MY LAST MORSEL OF FOOD I BEGAN TO WONDER IF I MUST AFTER ALL DIE OF HUNGER THEN
FROM WHICH I HAD SUFFERED BEFORE AND AT LENGTH WE REACHED BAGDAD MY FIRST CARE WAS TO PRESENT MYSELF BEFORE THE CALIPH AND GIVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF MY EMBASSY HE ASSURED ME THAT MY LONG ABSENCE HAD DISQUIETED HIM MUCH BUT HE HAD NEVERTHELESS HOPED FOR THE BEST
AND SAID THAT ADVENTURES SO SURPRISING MUST BE RELATED TO THEIR KING ONLY BY THE MAN TO WHOM THEY HAD HAPPENED SO PROCURING A HORSE THEY MOUNTED ME UPON IT AND WE SET OUT
AND OLD MEN WEEPING FONDLY AS RHEA'S BOYS GO BY
I HAD INDEED GOOD REASON FOR MY TERROR WHEN AN INSTANT LATER THE LARGEST OF THE ANIMALS WOUND HIS TRUNK ROUND THE STEM OF MY TREE AND WITH ONE MIGHTY EFFORT TORE IT UP BY THE ROOTS BRINGING ME TO THE GROUND ENTANGLED IN ITS BRANCHES
BYRSA'S THOUSAND MASTS WHERE FUR CLAD HUNTERS WANDER AMIDST THE NORTHERN ICE WHERE THROUGH THE SAND OF MORNING LAND THE CAMEL BEARS THE SPICE WHERE ATLAS FLINGS HIS SHADOW
I WILL RIDE UNTO MY LORD SIR LAUNCELOT FOR TO HELP HIM FALL OF HIM WHAT FALL MAY FOR HE IS THE SAME MAN THAT MADE ME KNIGHT YE SHALL NOT SO SAID SIR BORS BY MY COUNSEL UNLESS THAT YE WERE DISGUISED YE SHALL SEE ME DISGUISED SAID SIR GARETH
WHAT WAS MY NAME I AM SINDBAD I REPLIED WHOM MEN CALL THE SAILOR FOR I HAVE VOYAGED MUCH UPON MANY SEAS AND HOW COME YOU HERE ASKED THE KING I TOLD MY STORY CONCEALING NOTHING
I SHOULD BE NO WORSE OFF THAN I WAS NOW FOR DEATH STARED ME IN THE FACE WHILE THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT AS I WAS BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR I MIGHT FIND MYSELF SAFE AND SOUND IN SOME DESIRABLE LAND I DECIDED AT ANY RATE TO RISK IT
AND LASTLY A BEAUTIFUL SLAVE GIRL WHOSE ROBES GLITTERED WITH PRECIOUS STONES AFTER A LONG AND PROSPEROUS VOYAGE WE LANDED AT BALSORA AND I MADE HASTE TO REACH BAGDAD
TELL ME SAID HE CAN YOU SHOOT WITH A BOW
I REPLIED THAT NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN TO TELL THEM BUT THAT I WAS STARVING AND WOULD FAIN EAT SOMETHING FIRST I WAS SOON SUPPLIED WITH ALL I NEEDED AND HAVING SATISFIED MY HUNGER I TOLD THEM FAITHFULLY ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN ME
TRUST ME TRULY IT WILL BE NO BOOT TO STRIVE WITH THEM BUT IF WE SHOULD FALL TEN OR TWELVE UPON ONE KNIGHT AND THAT WERE NO WORSHIP BUT SHAME YE SAY TRUTH SAID THE KING AND FOR TO SAY SOOTH SAID THE KING
WAS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDLY LOOKING BLACK MEN I ROSE AND SALUTED THEM AND THEY SPOKE TO ME IN RETURN BUT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD OF THEIR LANGUAGE FEELING PERFECTLY BEWILDERED BY MY SUDDEN RETURN TO LIFE AND LIGHT I MURMURED TO MYSELF IN ARABIC
AND WOE TO THEM THAT SHEAR HER AND WOE TO THEM THAT GOAD WHEN ALL THE PACK LOUD BAYING HER BLOODY LAIR SURROUNDS SHE DIES IN SILENCE BITING HARD AMIDST THE DYING HOUNDS
FURTHER MY LORD IN SERENDIB NO JUDGE IS NEEDED FOR TO THE KING HIMSELF HIS PEOPLE COME FOR JUSTICE THE CALIPH WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY REPORT FROM THE KING'S LETTER SAID HE I JUDGED THAT HE WAS A WISE MAN
BUT THIS DUKE GALAHAD THE HAUT PRINCE WAS A NOBLE KNIGHT
AND SIR GAWAINE SMOTE DOWN FOUR KNIGHTS AND THEN THERE BEGAN A STRONG MEDLEY FOR THEN THERE CAME IN THE KNIGHTS OF LAUNCELOT'S BLOOD AND SIR GARETH AND SIR PALOMIDES WITH THEM
I TRAVELLED A CONSIDERABLE WAY OVERLAND AND FINALLY EMBARKED FROM A DISTANT INDIAN PORT WITH A CAPTAIN WHO MEANT TO MAKE A LONG VOYAGE AND TRULY HE DID SO FOR WE FELL IN WITH STORMY WEATHER WHICH DROVE US COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR COURSE SO THAT FOR MANY DAYS
AND LIBER LOVES THE VINE AND PALES LOVES THE STRAW BUILT SHED WARM WITH THE BREATH OF KINE AND VENUS LOVES THE WHISPERS OF PLIGHTED YOUTH AND MAID IN APRIL'S IVORY MOONLIGHT
CLOSE THINE EYES AND WHILE THOU SLEEPEST HEAVEN WILL CHANGE THY FORTUNE FROM EVIL TO GOOD ONE OF THE NATIVES WHO UNDERSTOOD THIS TONGUE THEN CAME FORWARD SAYING MY BROTHER
OUR FLOCKS ARE WHITE ON MANY A HILL
ON THE SEASHORE AND AT THE MOUTHS OF THE RIVERS THE DIVERS SEEK FOR PEARLS AND IN SOME VALLEYS DIAMONDS ARE PLENTIFUL AFTER MANY DAYS I PETITIONED THE KING THAT I MIGHT RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY TO WHICH HE GRACIOUSLY CONSENTED MOREOVER HE LOADED ME WITH RICH GIFTS
I HAD THE CURIOSITY TO ASCEND TO ITS VERY SUMMIT FOR THIS WAS THE PLACE TO WHICH ADAM WAS BANISHED OUT OF PARADISE HERE ARE FOUND RUBIES AND MANY PRECIOUS THINGS AND RARE PLANTS GROW ABUNDANTLY WITH CEDAR TREES AND COCOA PALMS
WHEREUPON I TURNED AND MADE FOR THE CITY AS FAST AS I COULD GO NOT SEEING A SINGLE ELEPHANT BY THE WAY WHICH CONVINCED ME THAT THEY HAD RETIRED DEEPER INTO THE FOREST TO LEAVE THE WAY OPEN TO THE IVORY HILL AND I DID NOT KNOW HOW SUFFICIENTLY TO ADMIRE THEIR SAGACITY
FOR NO MAN SHALL NEVER MAKE HIM BE AGAINST SIR LAUNCELOT BECAUSE HE MADE HIM KNIGHT
NEPHEW I BELIEVE YOU THEREFORE TELL ME NOW WHAT IS YOUR BEST COUNSEL SIR SAID SIR GAWAINE YE SHALL HAVE MY COUNSEL LET BLOW UNTO LODGING FOR AN HE BE SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAKE AND MY BROTHER SIR GARETH WITH HIM WITH THE HELP OF THAT GOOD YOUNG KNIGHT SIR LAVAINE
AND HE THAT WAS COURTEOUS TRUE AND FAITHFUL TO HIS FRIEND WAS THAT TIME CHERISHED CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE HOW TRUE LOVE IS LIKENED TO SUMMER AND THUS IT PASSED ON FROM CANDLEMASS UNTIL AFTER EASTER THAT THE MONTH OF MAY WAS COME
THAT WHEN IT BECAME A SKELETON MY MASTER MIGHT RETURN AND SECURE ITS TUSKS FOR TWO MONTHS I HUNTED THUS AND NO DAY PASSED WITHOUT MY SECURING AN ELEPHANT OF COURSE I DID NOT ALWAYS STATION MYSELF IN THE SAME TREE BUT SOMETIMES IN ONE PLACE SOMETIMES IN ANOTHER
BUT THE OLD LOVE WAS NOT SO MEN AND WOMEN COULD LOVE TOGETHER SEVEN YEARS AND NO LICOURS LUSTS WERE BETWEEN THEM AND THEN WAS LOVE TRUTH AND FAITHFULNESS AND LO IN LIKE WISE WAS USED LOVE IN KING ARTHUR'S DAYS
BUT THOU WHAT DOST THOU HERE IN THE OLD MAN'S PEACEFUL HALL WHAT DOTH THE EAGLE IN THE COOP THE BISON IN THE STALL OUR CORN FILLS MANY A GARNER OUR VINES CLASP MANY A TREE
I SEE WELL BY HIS RIDING AND BY HIS GREAT STROKES AND THE OTHER KNIGHT IN THE SAME COLOURS IS THE GOOD YOUNG KNIGHT SIR LAVAINE ALSO THAT KNIGHT WITH THE GREEN SHIELD IS MY BROTHER SIR GARETH AND YET HE HATH DISGUISED HIMSELF
THEY MARCHED BY FOLD AND STALL BY CORNFIELD AND BY VINEYARD
AND THE OTHERS RETREATED LEAVING ME FREE TO COME DOWN FROM MY HIDING PLACE AND RUN BACK TO TELL MY MASTER OF MY SUCCESS FOR WHICH I WAS PRAISED AND REGALED WITH GOOD THINGS THEN WE WENT BACK TO THE FOREST TOGETHER AND DUG A MIGHTY TRENCH IN WHICH WE BURIED THE ELEPHANT I HAD KILLED IN ORDER
AND THE KING OF NORTHUMBERLAND RIGHT STRAIT CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR HOW KING ARTHUR MARVELLED MUCH OF THE JOUSTING IN THE FIELD AND HOW HE RODE AND FOUND SIR LAUNCELOT
A HUNDRED OF THE FINEST WHITE LINEN FROM CAIRO SUEZ CUFA AND ALEXANDRIA THEN MORE BEDS OF DIFFERENT FASHION AND AN AGATE VASE CARVED WITH THE FIGURE OF A MAN AIMING AN ARROW AT A LION AND FINALLY A COSTLY TABLE
ALSO ARTHUR BLAMED SIR GARETH BECAUSE HE LEFT HIS FELLOWSHIP AND HELD WITH SIR LAUNCELOT MY LORD SAID SIR GARETH HE MADE ME A KNIGHT AND WHEN I SAW HIM SO HARD BESTEAD METHOUGHT IT WAS MY WORSHIP TO HELP HIM
WHEN EVERY LUSTY HEART BEGINNETH TO BLOSSOM AND TO BRING FORTH FRUIT FOR LIKE AS HERBS AND TREES BRING FORTH FRUIT AND FLOURISH IN MAY IN LIKE WISE EVERY LUSTY HEART THAT IS IN ANY MANNER A LOVER SPRINGETH AND FLOURISHETH IN LUSTY DEEDS
OF THE EAST BESIDE HIM STALKS TO BATTLE THE HUGE EARTH SHAKING BEAST THE BEAST ON WHOM THE CASTLE WITH ALL ITS GUARDS DOTH STAND THE BEAST WHO HATH BETWEEN HIS EYES THE SERPENT FOR A HAND
IS IT NOT JUST THAT I SHOULD NOW ENJOY A LIFE OF EASE AND TRANQUILLITY
FOR EVER A WORSHIPFUL MAN WILL BE LOATH TO SEE A WORSHIPFUL MAN SHAMED AND HE THAT IS OF NO WORSHIP AND FARETH WITH COWARDICE NEVER SHALL HE SHOW GENTLENESS NOR NO MANNER OF GOODNESS WHERE HE SEETH A MAN IN ANY DANGER
BUT NOWADAYS MEN CAN NOT LOVE SEVEN NIGHT BUT THEY MUST HAVE ALL THEIR DESIRES THAT LOVE MAY NOT ENDURE BY REASON FOR WHERE THEY BE SOON ACCORDED AND HASTY HEAT SOON IT COOLETH RIGHT SO FARETH LOVE NOWADAYS SOON HOT SOON COLD THIS IS NO STABILITY
AGAIN BOWING HUMBLY BEFORE HIM I CAN ASSURE YOUR MAJESTY THAT HE HAS IN NO WAY EXAGGERATED HIS WEALTH AND GRANDEUR NOTHING CAN EQUAL THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS PALACE WHEN HE GOES ABROAD HIS THRONE IS PREPARED UPON THE BACK OF AN ELEPHANT
AND HIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT WERE SO GREAT THAT HE ORDERED MY ADVENTURES TO BE WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF GOLD AND LAID UP IN THE ARCHIVES OF HIS KINGDOM
FOR HE SMOTE DOWN THAT DAY AND PULLED DOWN MO THAN THIRTY KNIGHTS AND AS THE FRENCH BOOK SAITH SIR LAUNCELOT MARVELLED WHEN HE BEHELD SIR GARETH DO SUCH DEEDS WHAT KNIGHT HE MIGHT BE AND SIR LAVAINE PULLED DOWN AND SMOTE DOWN TWENTY KNIGHTS
SO THIS TOURNAMENT AND THIS JOUSTS DURED LONG TILL IT WAS NEAR NIGHT FOR THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE RELIEVED EVER UNTO KING ARTHUR FOR THE KING WAS WROTH OUT OF MEASURE THAT HE AND HIS KNIGHTS MIGHT NOT PREVAIL THAT DAY THEN SIR GAWAINE SAID TO THE KING
I VENTURED TO SAY THAT I MYSELF AND ALL THAT I HAD WERE AT HIS DISPOSAL BUT HE ANSWERED ME SMILING NAY SINDBAD
MOUNTED UPON RICHLY CAPARISONED ELEPHANTS GO BEFORE HIM AND AS THE PROCESSION MOVES ONWARD THE OFFICER WHO GUIDES HIS ELEPHANT CRIES ALOUD BEHOLD THE MIGHTY MONARCH THE POWERFUL AND VALIANT SULTAN OF THE INDIES WHOSE PALACE IS COVERED WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND RUBIES
THE HEAD OF KING AMULIUS OF THE GREAT SYLVIAN LINE WHO REIGNED IN ALBA LONGA
AND WE ASK OF YOU A LIKE REGARD IF YOU DEEM US WORTHY OF IT ADIEU BROTHER THE PRESENT CONSISTED OF A VASE CARVED FROM A SINGLE RUBY SIX INCHES HIGH AND AS THICK AS MY FINGER THIS WAS FILLED WITH THE CHOICEST PEARLS
AMBERGRIS AND PRECIOUS STUFFS AND BOUND THEM UPON MY RAFT BEING CAREFUL TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE AND THEN I SEATED MYSELF UPON IT HAVING TWO SMALL OARS THAT I HAD FASHIONED LAID READY TO MY HAND AND LOOSED THE CORD WHICH HELD IT TO THE BANK
AND WHEN I WENT TO TAKE LEAVE OF HIM HE ENTRUSTED ME WITH A ROYAL PRESENT AND A LETTER TO THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL OUR SOVEREIGN LORD SAYING
AND SO MANY NOBLE KNIGHTS AGAINST HIM AND WHEN I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAKE I SHAMED TO SEE SO MANY KNIGHTS AGAINST HIM ALONE TRULY SAID KING ARTHUR UNTO SIR GARETH YE SAY WELL AND WORSHIPFULLY HAVE YE DONE
FOUR AND FORTY VALIANT MEN WITH CLUB AND AXE AND BOW ON EACH SIDE EVERY HAMLET POURS FORTH ITS JOYOUS CROWD SHOUTING LADS AND BAYING DOGS AND CHILDREN LAUGHING LOUD
WHEN THE SHIPS AT LAST ARRIVED MY MASTER HIMSELF CHOSE THE ONE IN WHICH I WAS TO SAIL AND PUT ON BOARD FOR ME A GREAT STORE OF CHOICE PROVISIONS ALSO IVORY IN ABUNDANCE AND ALL THE COSTLIEST CURIOSITIES OF THE COUNTRY FOR WHICH I COULD NOT THANK HIM ENOUGH
SO SAYING HE GAVE ME A SUPPLY OF FOOD AND RETURNED TO THE TOWN AND I PERCHED MYSELF HIGH UP IN THE TREE AND KEPT WATCH THAT NIGHT I SAW NOTHING BUT JUST AFTER SUNRISE THE NEXT MORNING A LARGE HERD OF ELEPHANTS CAME CRASHING AND TRAMPLING BY
BE NOT SURPRISED TO SEE US THIS IS OUR LAND AND AS WE CAME TO GET WATER FROM THE RIVER WE NOTICED YOUR RAFT FLOATING DOWN IT AND ONE OF US SWAM OUT AND BROUGHT YOU TO THE SHORE WE HAVE WAITED FOR YOUR AWAKENING TELL US NOW WHENCE YOU COME AND WHERE YOU WERE GOING BY THAT DANGEROUS WAY
KING ARTHUR DID PASSINGLY WELL AND SO THEREWITHAL CAME IN SIR GAWAINE AND SIR GAHERIS SIR AGRAVAINE AND SIR MORDRED
THE AUTHOR OF THY LINE AND SUCH AS SHE WHO SUCKLED THEE EVEN SUCH BE THOU AND THINE
IN ALBA'S LAKE NO FISHER
AND TURNING TO HINDBAD HE ADDED WELL MY FRIEND AND WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW
PRESENTLY MY RAFT WAS BROUGHT IN AND THE BALES OPENED IN HIS PRESENCE AND THE KING DECLARED THAT IN ALL HIS TREASURY THERE WERE NO SUCH RUBIES AND EMERALDS AS THOSE WHICH LAY IN GREAT HEAPS BEFORE HIM SEEING THAT HE LOOKED AT THEM WITH INTEREST
AND THE MOST PART OF THEM WERE KNIGHTS OF THE TABLE ROUND AND EVER THE KNIGHTS OF HIS BLOOD WITHDREW THEM AND MADE THEM ADO IN OTHER PLACES WHERE SIR LAUNCELOT CAME NOT
COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I ANSWERED I AM READY TO DO ALL THAT YOUR MAJESTY COMMANDS BUT I HUMBLY PRAY YOU TO REMEMBER THAT I AM UTTERLY DISHEARTENED BY THE UNHEARD OF SUFFERINGS I HAVE UNDERGONE INDEED I HAVE MADE A VOW
AND SPEEDILY BUILT MYSELF A STOUT RAFT OF DRIFT WOOD WITH STRONG CORDS OF WHICH ENOUGH AND TO SPARE LAY STREWN UPON THE BEACH I THEN MADE UP MANY PACKAGES OF RUBIES EMERALDS ROCK CRYSTAL
NOW I DREAD ME SORE SAID SIR BORS THAT MY LORD SIR LAUNCELOT WILL BE HARD MATCHED
THEN SIR LAUNCELOT SMOTE DOWN SIR AGRAVAINE AND SIR GAHERIS AND SIR MORDRED AND SIR GARETH SMOTE DOWN SIR KAY
AND THERE THE KING PRAYED THEM ALL UNTO SUPPER
SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT I DECLARED MYSELF WILLING TO OBEY AND THE CALIPH DELIGHTED AT HAVING GOT HIS OWN WAY GAVE ME A THOUSAND SEQUINS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE VOYAGE I WAS SOON READY TO START AND TAKING THE LETTER AND THE PRESENT I EMBARKED AT BALSORA
AND THEN SIR LAVAINE WAS HORSED AGAIN AND HE SMOTE DOWN SIR LUCAN THE BUTLER AND SIR BEDEVERE AND THEN THERE BEGAN GREAT THRONG OF GOOD KNIGHTS
BUT FORTHWITHAL KING ARTHUR LET SEND UNTO THE FOUR KINGS AND TO THE MIGHTY DUKE AND PRAYED THEM THAT THE KNIGHT WITH THE SLEEVE OF GOLD DEPART NOT FROM THEM BUT THAT THE KING MAY SPEAK WITH HIM THEN FORTHWITHAL KING ARTHUR ALIGHTED AND UNARMED HIM
AND WE SHUDDERED TO THINK HOW SOON OUR OWN WOULD BE ADDED TO THE HEAP ALL AROUND TOO LAY VAST QUANTITIES OF THE COSTLIEST MERCHANDISE AND TREASURES WERE HEAPED IN EVERY CRANNY OF THE ROCKS BUT ALL THESE THINGS ONLY ADDED TO THE DESOLATION OF THE SCENE
I FELL INTO THE HANDS OF A RICH MERCHANT WHO TOOK ME HOME WITH HIM AND CLOTHED AND FED ME WELL AND AFTER SOME DAYS SENT FOR ME AND QUESTIONED ME AS TO WHAT I COULD DO I ANSWERED THAT I WAS A RICH MERCHANT WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY PIRATES AND THEREFORE I KNEW NO TRADE
TOWARDS THE FOOT OF A MOUNTAIN WHICH ROSE SHEER OUT OF THE SEA AND OUR VESSEL WAS DASHED TO PIECES UPON THE ROCKS AT ITS BASE NOT HOWEVER UNTIL WE HAD MANAGED TO SCRAMBLE ON SHORE CARRYING WITH US THE MOST PRECIOUS OF OUR POSSESSIONS WHEN WE HAD DONE THIS THE CAPTAIN SAID TO US
DECLARED THAT WE WERE IN THE MOST DANGEROUS SPOT UPON THE WHOLE WIDE SEA AND HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY A CURRENT WHICH WAS AT THAT MINUTE SWEEPING US TO DESTRUCTION IT WAS TOO TRUE IN SPITE OF ALL THE SAILORS COULD DO WE WERE DRIVEN WITH FRIGHTFUL RAPIDITY
BY THE TIME I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF MY COMPANIONS MY STOCK OF PROVISIONS WAS SO SMALL THAT I HARDLY THOUGHT I SHOULD LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO DIG MY OWN GRAVE WHICH I SET ABOUT DOING WHILE I REGRETTED BITTERLY THE ROVING DISPOSITION
I LOADED MY PACK ANIMALS AND JOINED A CARAVAN OF MERCHANTS OUR JOURNEY WAS LONG AND TEDIOUS BUT I BORE IT PATIENTLY
THIS THEN MUST BE THE ELEPHANTS BURYING PLACE I SAID TO MYSELF AND THEY MUST HAVE BROUGHT ME HERE THAT I MIGHT CEASE TO PERSECUTE THEM SEEING THAT I WANT NOTHING BUT THEIR TUSKS AND HERE LIE MORE THAN I COULD CARRY AWAY IN A LIFETIME
THIS RIVER WHICH HID ITSELF UNDERGROUND DOUBTLESS EMERGED AGAIN AT SOME DISTANT SPOT WHY SHOULD I NOT BUILD A RAFT AND TRUST MYSELF TO ITS SWIFTLY FLOWING WATERS IF I PERISHED BEFORE I COULD REACH THE LIGHT OF DAY ONCE MORE
AND ALSO HE SMOTE DOWN SIR MORDRED AND ALL THIS WAS WITH ONE SPEAR
WHEN WE HAD LOADED OUR ELEPHANT WITH AS MANY TUSKS AS IT COULD CARRY AND WERE ON OUR WAY BACK TO THE CITY HE SAID MY BROTHER SINCE I CAN NO LONGER TREAT AS A SLAVE ONE WHO HAS ENRICHED ME THUS TAKE YOUR LIBERTY AND MAY HEAVEN PROSPER YOU I WILL NO LONGER CONCEAL FROM YOU
THEN SIR GARETH CAME DRIVING TO SIR LAUNCELOT ALL THAT HE MIGHT AND SAID KNIGHT KEEP THYSELF FOR YONDER COMETH KING ARTHUR WITH NINE NOBLE KNIGHTS WITH HIM TO PUT YOU TO A REBUKE AND SO I AM COME TO BEAR YOU FELLOWSHIP FOR OLD LOVE YE HAVE SHEWED ME
HATH DONNED HIS WHITEST GOWN AND EVERY HEAD IN ALBA WEARETH A POPLAR CROWN AND EVERY ALBAN DOOR POST WITH BOUGHS AND FLOWERS IS GAY FOR TO DAY THE DEAD ARE LIVING THE LOST ARE FOUND
HE DREW CLOSER TO THE DESK AT WHICH HIS ASSISTANT WAS SITTING
THERE WAS A GENERAL LAUGH THROUGHOUT THE COURTROOM AT WHICH THE CORONER RAPPED LOUDLY ON THE DESK SILENCE SUCH AHEM CONDUCT AT AN INQUEST IS NOT TO BE ALLOWED IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN I SHALL CLEAR THE COURTROOM
PERHAPS THERE IS A WHIFF LEFT IN IT THANKS BUT DO YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE QUERIED THE DETECTIVE AND GAVE A LAUGH WHEN THE EMPTY VIAL WAS PRODUCED HE OPENED IT AND TOOK A SHORT SNIFF THEN HE DREW HIS BREATH IN SHARPLY
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM LETTY HE QUESTIONED
NOT AT ALL QUERIED CORONER BUSBY ELEVATING HIS EYES IN SURPRISE EITHER REAL OR AFFECTED WE HELD DIFFERENT OPINIONS UPON CERTAIN QUESTIONS BUT WE DID NOT QUARREL HUM THE CORONER MUSED FOR A MOMENT THAT IS ALL FOR THE PRESENT HE ADDED
ALEXANDER AND COMPANY WHOLESALE DRUGGISTS

A FAINT ODOR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE SAME ODOR HE HAD DETECTED IN THE CARPET ON THE UPPER HALLWAY OF THE LANGMORE MANSION
AND THEN THE DETECTIVE HAD TO FAIRLY TEAR HIMSELF FROM THE DOCTOR AND THE HOUSE THEY WERE OLD FRIENDS AND HAD WORKED ON MANY A CASE TOGETHER ONCE BACK IN HIS OFFICE ADAM ADAMS SMILED GRIMLY TO HIMSELF
CAN I DO ANYTHING GET YOU SOME WATER NO NOTHING SHE ANSWERED AND DROPPED A VEIL OVER HER FACE THE NEXT WITNESS CALLED WAS MARY BILLINGS THE DOMESTIC EMPLOYED AT THE LANGMORE MANSION AND WHO HAD BEEN ABOUT THE PLACE AT THE TIME OF THE TRAGEDY
WHEN DID THEY QUARREL LAST AT THIS QUESTION THE DOMESTIC PURSED UP HER LIPS AND LOOKED AT MARGARET OI HAVE NOTHIN TO SAY ABOUT THAT SHE ANSWERED COLDLY THIS REPLY WAS A SURPRISE TO ALL INCLUDING RAYMOND
TO LAVE IT TILL YOU CAME MISSUS LANGMORE WAS QUITE DEAD YIS
YES BUT NOT VERY WELL I DON'T THINK IT WILL AFFECT ME MUCH I TRUST NOT MY DEAR ADAMS WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE YOU NOW WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT ANOTHER CASE THAT'S ALL I DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT JUST YET
DID MISTER PICKERELL SAY HE THOUGHT MISTER LANGMORE HAD WRITTEN THIS NOTE QUESTIONED THE CORONER HE SAID THE TWO HANDWRITINGS WERE EXACTLY ALIKE HERE IS A LETTER WRITTEN AND SIGNED BY MISTER LANGMORE YOU CAN COMPARE THE TWO IF YOU WISH THE LETTER WAS PASSED OVER
I'LL GIVE YOU THE PARTICULARS SOME OTHER TIME AND HAVE I HELPED YOU I THINK YOU HAVE OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER POWDERS AND THERE IS CHLOROFORM I THINK WE HAVE STRUCK A CLUE IN THIS BUT I MUST BE GOING WHAT SO SOON
AT THIS DIRECT QUESTION THE YOUNG MAN GAVE AN INWARD GROAN I DON'T KNOW HE ANSWERED IN AN UNNATURAL VOICE WE MUST HOPE FOR THE BEST IN LESS THAN AN HOUR IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE JURY HAD ARRIVED AT A VERDICT
WHAT WE FOUND UNDER THE STONE VERY WELL MISS LANGMORE YOU MAY HAVE THE RING BACK IT WAS PASSED OUT AND RAYMOND TOOK IT AND SLIPPED IT BACK ON MARGARET'S HAND WHICH WAS COLD AND NERVELESS THE GIRL WAS SITTING AS MOTIONLESS AS A MARBLE STATUE
IF HE'S AS SLICK AT TRYIN FOLKS AS HE IS IN A HOSS DICKER RETURNED AN OLD FARMER WHO HAD MADE A TRADE OF STEEDS WHICH HAD PROVED UNPROFITABLE FOR HIM MARGARET WAS SHOWN TO A CHAIR AND SAT DOWN WITH RAYMOND BESIDE HER THE YOUNG MAN WAS PLAINLY NERVOUS
AND WHENEVER THEY COME NEAR ONE THEY UTTER A PRAYER FOR DELIVERANCE FROM ITS EVILS IF YOU SLEEP NEAR THE YAMLANG BUSH IT WILL MAKE YOU VERY SICK AND THAT POWDER
AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW PERSONS IN THIS COUNTRY WHO KNEW OF THE HEATHENISH COMPOUND IF YOU ARE INNOCENT I RATHER RECKON YOU HAVE A HEAP OF EXPLANATIONS TO MAKE THERE WERE TWO CALLERS WHO TOOK AN HOUR OF THE DETECTIVE'S TIME AND THEN HE PREPARED TO RETURN TO SIDHAM
IN A MOMENT MORE MARGARET REVIVED TAKE ME AWAY SHE MOANED I AM SORRY
I BOUGHT THAT CHLOROFORM A MONTH AGO AND USED IT TO PUT A SICK CANARY AND A SICK PARROT OUT OF THEIR MISERY MARY BILLINGS SAW ME CHLOROFORM THE PARROT WHEN DID YOU DO THE CHLOROFORMING ABOUT A WEEK AGO ON THE PARROT

SHE COULD NOT FINISH BUT HAD TO BITE HER LIP TO KEEP THE TEARS FROM FLOWING THE CORONER MOUNTED THE PLATFORM AND RAPPED ON A DESK WITH HIS KNUCKLES THE AHEM COURTROOM WILL COME TO ORDER HE CALLED OUT GAZING AROUND ON ALL SIDES
CERTAIN CYANIDE COMPOUNDS MIGHT BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DO SO UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS ANY REAL DRY POWDER WOULD CHOKE A PERSON IF HE GOT A BIG DOSE OF IT I HEARD OF A BOY WHO CAME NEAR DYING AS THE RESULT OF BREATHING IN A QUANTITY OF EXTRA DRY LICORICE POWDER

IT IS TRUE SIR ANSWERED MARGARET AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE DURING WHICH THE EYES OF ALL IN THE COURTROOM WERE FIXED UPON THE GIRL IT IS SAID THAT YOU HAD VIOLENT QUARRELS PURSUED THE CORONER
TO LEARN IF POSSIBLE MORE CONCERNING TOM OSTRELLO AND IF ANYBODY BESIDES CEPHAS CARBOY HAD SEEN HIM AROUND THAT VICINITY ON THE MORNING OF THE TRAGEDY LETTY I MAY NOT BE BACK TO NIGHT HE REMARKED AS HE CAME OUT INTO THE GENERAL OFFICE

WHICH BOTH OF US ARE CONVINCED IS A BIT OF DRIED UP BLOOD YOU ARE SURE IT IS BLOOD YES I CAN ILLUSTRATE IT SCIENTIFICALLY IF YOU DESIRE IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY JUST NOW WHEN YOU SAY BLOOD DO YOU MEAN HUMAN BLOOD
BRIEFLY PUT DOCTOR THE CASE IS THIS SAID ADAM ADAMS
A HUNDRED THEORIES WERE AFLOAT ALL CENTERING ON THE ONE OBJECT TO FIND THE MURDERER FIND HIM OR HER AND SWING HIM OR HER TO THE NEAREST TREE WAS THE VERDICT OF MANY
IF HE SHOULD BREATHE OF IT A POWDER STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL A PERSON
WHO WAS IN CHARGE DOWNSTAIRS DID VERY WELL YOU MAY STEP DOWN MISSUS GASPARD AND THE OTHER WOMAN CAME FORWARD TO FACE THE CORONER AND HIS JURY AND WAS SWORN MISSUS MORSE SAYS YOU FOUND SOMETHING OF IMPORTANCE WHAT WAS IT
AND NOT ONLY THE CORONER BUT ALSO HIS JURY LOOKED AT BOTH DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING WHISPERED ONE MAN EXACTLY THE SAME ADDED ANOTHER AND THE REST NODDED THE CORONER LOOKED AROUND THE COURTROOM AND THEN AT THE JURY
YES UNCLE ADAM I MET HIM LAST WINTER AT MISSUS DALLY'S RECEPTION HE IS A TRAVELING SALESMAN FOR THIS HOUSE
HER HUSBAND WOULD BE MUCH AFFECTED THE KING WAS NOT ONLY ATTENTIVE TO THE FATE OF HIS ALLY AND WATCHFUL LEST
IF ALL OF US WHO ARE BORN SHOULD LIVE AND HAVE FAMILIES AND NOT DIE UNTIL OLD AGE CAME ON THERE WOULD SOON BE SO MANY OF US THAT WE SHOULD EAT ALL THE ORANGE TREES IN THE WORLD AND THEN WE SHOULD ALL STARVE TO DEATH AND THIS IS QUITE TRUE
CONTRACTED BETWEEN THE PARTIES AN EVENT WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS ATTENDED WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES THE SAME YEAR ANOTHER MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED WHICH WAS ALSO IN THE NEXT AGE PRODUCTIVE OF GREAT EVENTS
MIGHT BE TEMPTED BY AMBITION TO LAY IMMEDIATE CLAIM TO THE CROWN BY HIS PERPETUAL ATTENTION TO DEPRESS THE PARTISANS OF THE YORK FAMILY
NOW THEY LOOK JUST AS YOUR MOTHER DID FROM ABOVE
I KNOW IT SEEMS STRANGE TO YOU HE CONTINUED NOTICING THE LOOK OF ASTONISHMENT ON CITRINUS'S FACE BUT SOME DAY YOU WILL LOOK JUST LIKE ME YOU WILL HAVE WINGS AND BE ABLE TO FLY AND WILL HAVE LONG FEELERS ON YOUR HEAD
AND OF TAKING EVERY ADVANTAGE WHICH HIS OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GIVE HIS ENEMIES AGAINST HIM AND
FIRST HOWEVER EACH THRUST HIS BEAK INTO THE LEAF AND TOOK A GOOD DRINK OF SAP THEN THEY WERE READY TO BEGIN THEIR JOURNEYING BUT A TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED
WHICH IT MOVED SLOWLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE IT HAD AN IMMENSE EYE WHICH LOOKED LIKE A HEMISPHERICAL WINDOW WITH HUNDREDS OF PANES OF GLASS IN IT THE BEAST'S LEGS WERE LARGE AND POWERFUL
TO REMOVE ALL SOURCE OF DISCORD WITH THAT NEIGHBORING KINGDOM BY WHOSE ANIMOSITY ENGLAND HAD SO OFTEN BEEN INFESTED WHEN THIS MARRIAGE WAS DELIBERATED ON IN THE ENGLISH COUNCIL SOME OBJECTED THAT ENGLAND MIGHT
DAUGHTER OF MAXIMILIAN AND SISTER OF PHILIP BUT THE DECLINE OF HIS HEALTH PUT AN END TO ALL SUCH THOUGHTS
WITH THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WHICH IS GOING ON SO BITTERLY AMONG THE PEOPLE OF HIS KIND THE INSECTS FOR ALTHOUGH THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE ENOUGH PLANTS AND TREES TO SERVE AS FOOD FOR ALL OF THEM
TO APPEAR OPENLY IN COURT AND PLEAD HIS PARDON SUFFOLK MORE RESENTING THE AFFRONT THAN GRATEFUL FOR THE FAVOR HAD FLED INTO FLANDERS AND TAKEN SHELTER WITH HIS AUNT THE DUCHESS OF BURGUNDY
WHICH THE INIQUITIES AND SEVERITIES OF HIS REIGN RENDERED A VERY DISMAL PROSPECT TO HIM TO ALLAY THE TERRORS UNDER WHICH HE LABORED
THE YOUNG PRINCE A FEW MONTHS AFTER
BUT AS A GREAT NAME WITHOUT ANY REAL ASSISTANCE IS SOMETIMES OF SERVICE THE KNIGHTS OF RHODES WHO WERE AT THAT TIME ESTEEMED THE BULWARK OF CHRISTENDOM CHOSE THE KING PROTECTOR OF THEIR ORDER
THERE WAS ALSO A REMARKABLE SIMILARITY OF CHARACTER BETWEEN THESE TWO PRINCES BOTH WERE FULL OF CRAFT INTRIGUE AND DESIGN AND THOUGH A RESEMBLANCE OF THIS NATURE BE A SLENDER FOUNDATION FOR CONFIDENCE AND AMITY
RECENT OR OBSOLETE POSSIBLE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO BE EXECUTED THE SOLE END OF THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS WAS TO AMASS MONEY AND BRING EVERY ONE UNDER THE LASH OF THEIR AUTHORITY
TO PAY HEAVY FINES AND RANSOMS WHICH WERE CALLED MITIGATIONS AND COMPOSITIONS BY DEGREES THE VERY APPEARANCE OF LAW WAS NEGLECTED
TO INFORM THE COURT OF THIS IMPORTANT INCIDENT THE KING SENT IN ALL HASTE THE EARL OF ARUNDEL TO COMPLIMENT PHILIP ON HIS ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND AND TO INFORM HIM THAT HE INTENDED TO PAY HIM A VISIT IN PERSON
SHOULD PREVIOUSLY BE ADJUSTED AMONG CHRISTIAN PRINCES AND THAT SOME SEAPORT TOWNS IN ITALY SHOULD BE CONSIGNED TO HIM FOR HIS RETREAT AND SECURITY IT WAS EASY TO CONCLUDE THAT HENRY HAD DETERMINED NOT TO INTERMEDDLE IN ANY WAR AGAINST THE TURK
WHILE SHEDDING OUR SKIN WE MAKE A GREAT CHANGE IN OUR BODIES WE LOSE OUR LEGS SO WE SIMPLY REMAIN WHERE WE WENT TO SLEEP WITH OUR BEAKS STUCK INTO THE LEAF SUCKING THE SAP
HAD SET YOU FAR ABOVE APPREHENSIONS FROM ANY PERSON OF SO LITTLE CONSEQUENCE BUT TO GIVE YOU SATISFACTION I SHALL BANISH HIM
AND ON EACH FOOT THERE WERE TWO CLAWS EACH OF THEM AS LONG AS THE WHOLE BODY OF CITRINUS TRULY THIS WAS AN APPALLING SIGHT
WHICH ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION AND WAS EVEN THE OBJECT OF HIS ANXIETY AND CONCERN ISABELLA
SOME OF THE ORANGE DWELLERS LIVE IN MEXICO SOME LIVE IN FLORIDA AND SOME IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT THEY ARE TO BE FOUND WHEREVER ORANGES GROW OF COURSE YOU HAVE GUESSED ALREADY THAT THE ORANGE DWELLERS ARE NOT HUMAN BEINGS
WHERE THE FOLDED UP CAST SKINS ARE UNDERNEATH THE SCALE LIES THE ORANGE DWELLER WITH ITS SUCKING BEAK STUCK INTO THE SAP BUT WITH NO LEGS OR WINGS OR LONG HAIRY FEELERS AFTER A WHILE
SIR JOHN TRENCHARD A GENTLEMAN OF AUTHORITY IN THE COUNTY OF DORSET HEARING OF A FLEET UPON THE COAST HAD ASSEMBLED SOME FORCES AND BEING JOINED BY SIR JOHN CARY WHO WAS ALSO AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMED BODY
AND THEN A FILMY WHITE CLOUD SETTLED DOWN OVER IT ALL SHUTTING OUT THE SUNLIGHT AND THE BLUE SKY FINALLY THERE CAME A FEW MORE SHOCKS AND WRENCHES AND THEN TOTAL DARKNESS AND SILENCE CITRINUS
THE ARCHDUKE NOW KING OF CASTILE ATTENDED BY HIS CONSORT EMBARKED FOR SPAIN DURING THE WINTER SEASON BUT MEETING WITH A VIOLENT TEMPEST IN THE CHANNEL WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE SHELTER IN THE HARBOR OF WEYMOUTH
BEING BROWBEATEN BY THESE OPPRESSORS NAY FINED IMPRISONED AND PUNISHED IF THEY GAVE SENTENCE AGAINST THE INCLINATION OF THE MINISTERS THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF THE FEUDAL LAW WHICH STILL PREVAILED WAS TURNED
THE COMMONS CHOSE DUDLEY THEIR SPEAKER THE VERY MAN WHO WAS THE CHIEF INSTRUMENT OF HIS INIQUITIES AND THOUGH THE KING WAS KNOWN TO BE IMMENSELY OPULENT
HAD REDUCED THE PEOPLE TO ENTIRE SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE UNCONTROLLED THEREFORE BY APPREHENSION OR OPPOSITION OF ANY KIND HE GAVE FULL SCOPE TO HIS NATURAL PROPENSITY
THROUGH THE PREVALENCE OF SUCH AN ARBITRARY AND INIQUITOUS ADMINISTRATION THE ENGLISH IT MAY SAFELY BE AFFIRMED
BUT HE HAS HAD TIME ENOUGH TO TELL ME A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HIS LIFE AND AS IT IS SUCH A CURIOUS STORY AND IS UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE I VENTURE TO REPEAT IT HERE TO YOU AS A MATTER OF FACT I MUST CONFESS
IT WOULD BE VERY PLEASANT TO HAVE WINGS AND FLY ABOUT WHEREVER HE WISHED TO SEE THE WORLD SUDDENLY A GREAT SHOCK CAME HIS WORLD TREMBLED
HE SAW IT WAS PERFECTLY TRUE HE HAD NO MOUTH CITRINUS GENTLY WAVED HIS LITTLE SUCKING BEAK TO BE SURE HE STILL HAD IT SUDDENLY HE BEGAN TO CRY A SAD THOUGHT HAD COME TO HIM
AND BEING IN RIGHT OF HER MOTHER
EDMOND DE LA POLE EARL OF SUFFOLK
THAT MEASURE SAID PHILIP WILL REFLECT DISHONOR UPON YOU AS WELL AS MYSELF
WHEN SHE WAS FULL GROWN SHE HAD NO WINGS NO LEGS AND NO EYES BUT SHE HAD A VERY LONG BEAK AND COULD SUCK UP A GREAT DEAL OF ORANGE SAP IF YOU WILL LISTEN AND NOT INTERRUPT I WILL TELL YOU HOW WE ORANGE DWELLERS GROW
DESIROUS TO CONTINUE HIS ALLIANCE WITH SPAIN AND ALSO UNWILLING TO RESTORE CATHARINE'S DOWRY WHICH WAS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DUCATS OBLIGED HIS SECOND SON HENRY WHOM HE CREATED PRINCE OF WALES TO BE CONTRACTED TO THE INFANTA
THE HALF OF MEN'S LANDS AND RENTS WERE SEIZED DURING TWO YEARS AS A PENALTY IN CASE OF OUTLAWRY BUT THE CHIEF MEANS OF OPPRESSION EMPLOYED BY THESE MINISTERS
EVEN THE KING'S WARDS AFTER THEY CAME OF AGE WERE NOT SUFFERED TO ENTER INTO POSSESSION OF THEIR LANDS WITHOUT PAYING EXORBITANT FINES MEN WERE ALSO HARASSED WITH INFORMATIONS OF INTRUSION UPON SCARCE COLORABLE TITLES
THESE PROSPEROUS INCIDENTS THE KING MET WITH A DOMESTIC CALAMITY WHICH MADE NOT SUCH IMPRESSION ON HIM AS IT MERITED
HENRY IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL SUSPICION
AND RATHER THAN THE POPE SHOULD GO ALONE TO THE HOLY WARS UNACCOMPANIED BY ANY MONARCH HE EVEN PROMISED TO OVERLOOK ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND TO ATTEND HIM IN PERSON HE ONLY REQUIRED AS A NECESSARY CONDITION THAT ALL DIFFERENCES
THE VERY YOUNGEST OF THE FAMILY BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF FROM THE DAY OF ITS BIRTH THEY NEVER TASTE ANY OTHER KIND OF FOOD BUT THE JUICE FROM THE LEAF OR TWIG OR GOLDEN ORANGE ON WHICH THEY LIVE
AND PUT IT ON OUR BACKS TOGETHER WITH SOME WAX
HAD TRAVELED A THOUSAND MILES THE SUNLIGHT CAME AGAIN AND SOON AFTER CAME THAT GREATEST DANGER OF ALL THAT DANGER
AND HE KNEW THAT THE STRANGER HAD TOLD THE TRUTH
IMAGINE IF YOU CAN THE FEARFUL STRANGENESS OF IT TO HAVE ONE'S WORLD PLUCKED FROM ITS PLACE IN SPACE WRAPPED UP IN TISSUE PAPER AND PACKED INTO A GREAT BOX WITH A LOT OF OTHER WORLDS
WAS SO OVERAWED THAT AT THIS VERY TIME
THIS BEAUTIFUL CREATURE GREETED CITRINUS KINDLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING CITRINUS WHO WAS AT FIRST A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE STRANGE CREATURE WAS REASSURED BY ITS KIND GREETING AND ANSWERED SIMPLY I DON'T KNOW
STARTED TO MOVE SWIFTLY THROUGH SPACE THEN CAME A STOP A SERIES OF SHOCKS
THE PRINCE MADE ALL THE OPPOSITION OF WHICH A YOUTH OF TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WAS CAPABLE BUT AS THE KING PERSISTED IN HIS RESOLUTION THE ESPOUSALS WERE AT LENGTH BY MEANS OF THE POPE'S DISPENSATION
AND TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM AT WINDSOR HENRY RECEIVED HIM WITH ALL THE MAGNIFICENCE POSSIBLE AND WITH ALL THE SEEMING CORDIALITY BUT HE RESOLVED NOTWITHSTANDING
MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE ALL EATEN BY THE BEETLE MY FATHER AND MOTHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN AND NO ONE HAS TOLD ME WHERE TO GO THE STRANGER SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AND SAID
THIS INCIDENT SERVED HENRY AS A PRETENCE FOR HIS SEVERITY
CITRINUS IS ONE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS MORE THAN FIFTY INDEED
MANY INSECTS FIND IT EASIER OR PREFER TO EAT OTHER INSECTS THAN TO LIVE ON PLANT FOOD
DEEMING HIS THRONE NOW ENTIRELY SECURE PAID HIM RATHER THE GREATER DEFERENCE AND ATTENTION
AND EACH ONE DRINKS SO LITTLE SAP YET ALTOGETHER THEY DO A GREAT AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO THE ORANGE TREES OFTEN KILLING ALL THE TREES IN A LARGE ORCHARD SO THE LADY BIRDS ARE A GREAT HELP TO THE ORANGE GROWERS
OF AN UNRELENTING TEMPER THE SECOND BETTER BORN BETTER EDUCATED AND BETTER BRED BUT EQUALLY UNJUST SEVERE AND INFLEXIBLE BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN LAW THESE MEN WERE QUALIFIED TO PERVERT THE FORMS OF JUSTICE
TO MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIS CRIMES AND TO PURCHASE BY THE SACRIFICE OF PART OF HIS ILL GOTTEN TREASURES A RECONCILIATION WITH HIS OFFENDED MAKER
WHEN WE ARE HATCHED FROM OUR EGGS WE ARE ALL ALIKE BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE EACH HAVE A PLUMP LITTLE BODY SIX LEGS TWO EYES AND A SUCKING BEAK TO GET FOOD WITH WE WALK ABOUT FOR A FEW DAYS
I EXPECT THAT YOU WILL CARRY YOUR COMPLAISANCE FURTHER SAID THE KING I DESIRE TO HAVE SUFFOLK PUT INTO MY HANDS WHERE ALONE I CAN DEPEND UPON HIS SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE
COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HIS SENSES IT WAS SO WONDERFUL
YET INTERESTED HIM SO LITTLE AS NEVER TO TOUCH HIM WITH CONCERN OR ANXIETY HIS CLOSE CONNECTIONS WITH SPAIN AND SCOTLAND
LITTLE CITRINUS ESCAPED FROM THE BEETLE BY CRAWLING INTO A SMALL DARK HOLE IN THE SURFACE OF THE LEAF
THAT HE WAS BIGGER THAN HE WAS BEFORE HE WENT TO SLEEP THEN
AND AS MARY AND I WERE THE MEANS OF SAVING HIS LIFE AND ARE TAKING CARE OF HIM AS WELL AS WE CAN MARY HAS HIM NOW ON A SMALL PIECE OF ORANGE RIND IN A PILL BOX
RIGIDLY PUT IN EXECUTION AGAINST ALL MEN SPIES INFORMERS AND INQUISITORS WERE REWARDED AND ENCOURAGED IN EVERY QUARTER OF THE KINGDOM AND NO DIFFERENCE WAS MADE WHETHER THE STATUTE WERE BENEFICIAL OR HURTFUL
BY MEANS OF THAT ALLIANCE FALL UNDER THE DOMINION OF SCOTLAND NO REPLIED HENRY SCOTLAND IN THAT EVENT
TO THE OPPRESSION OF THE INNOCENT AND THE FORMIDABLE AUTHORITY OF THE KING SUPPORTED THEM IN ALL THEIR INIQUITIES IT WAS THEIR USUAL PRACTICE AT FIRST
HE ALSO CONSIDERED THE SIMILARITY OF HIS OWN SITUATION WITH THAT OF FERDINAND AND REGARDED THE ISSUE OF THESE TRANSACTIONS AS A PRECEDENT FOR HIMSELF JOAN THE DAUGHTER OF FERDINAND BY ISABELLA
POINTED HOLLOW BEAK OR SUCKING TUBE WHICH SHE THRUST RIGHT INTO THE TENDER ORANGE LEAF AND THROUGH WHICH SHE SUCKED UP THE RICH SAP OR JUICE WHICH KEPT FLOWING INTO THE LEAF FROM THE TWIG IT HUNG ON
EACH HAD SIX LEGS AND A DELICATE LITTLE SUCKING BEAK PROJECTING FROM HIS SMALL PLUMP BODY CITRINUS AND HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS SCRAMBLED OUT FROM UNDER THE WAX SHELL
AND GOVERNED A KINGDOM MORE TURBULENT AND UNRULY
THE MARRIAGE OF MARGARET THE KING'S ELDEST DAUGHTER WITH JAMES KING OF SCOTLAND THIS ALLIANCE HAD BEEN NEGOTIATED DURING THREE YEARS THOUGH INTERRUPTED BY SEVERAL BROILS AND HENRY HOPED
AND SUBDUED THE DUCHY OF MILAN
WHO PURSUE THEM AND HE WAS HIGHLY INDIGNANT WHEN ONE SHREWD ORANGE DWELLER TOLD HIM THAT IT REALLY WAS A GOOD THING FOR THE RACE OF ORANGE DWELLERS THAT SO MANY OF THEM WERE KILLED FOR THE SHREWD ORANGE DWELLER SAID
THAN THE TRANSACTIONS IN SPAIN FERDINAND AS WELL AS HENRY HAD BECOME VERY UNPOPULAR AND FROM A LIKE CAUSE HIS FORMER EXACTIONS AND IMPOSITIONS
THEN SENT OFF THROUGH SPACE TO SOME OTHER PLACE WHERE ENORMOUS GIANTS WERE WAITING IMPATIENTLY FOR BREAKFAST WHEN CITRINUS'S WORLD REACHED OUR TOWN ONE OF THESE GIANTS WHO IS MY BROTHER TOOK IT UP AND SAYING
TO HEAR AND TO SMELL WITH AND BIG EYES TO SEE ALL AROUND YOU WITH YOU WILL HAVE SOME STRANGE EXPERIENCES THOUGH BEFORE YOU BECOME LIKE ME BUT AS I HAD STARTED TO SAY WE FATHERS AND THE MOTHERS TOO FOR THAT MATTER
FOR HE HAS LIVED ALREADY NEARLY THREE MONTHS
BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO MAKE HIM STOP THE RAPACIOUS HAND OF THOSE OPPRESSORS SIR WILLIAM CAPEL WAS AGAIN FINED TWO THOUSAND POUNDS UNDER SOME FRIVOLOUS PRETENCE AND WAS COMMITTED TO THE TOWER FOR DARING TO MURMUR AGAINST THE INIQUITY
COURTNEY WAS ATTAINTED AND THOUGH NOT EXECUTED HE RECOVERED NOT HIS LIBERTY DURING THE KING'S LIFETIME
THEY KEEP INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE WAX SCALE OR SHELL OVER THEIR BACKS
BEFORE LAYING THE EGGS CITRINUS'S MOTHER
HE RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND OBTAINED A NEW PARDON ACTUATED HOWEVER
FINDING THAT EVEN THE DUCHESS OF BURGUNDY TIRED WITH SO MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS HAD BECOME INDIFFERENT TO HIS CAUSE FLED SECRETLY INTO FRANCE THENCE INTO GERMANY
STRAIGHTWAY BEGAN UNWITTINGLY TO KILL ALL OF THE ORANGE DWELLERS ON IT BY VIGOROUSLY RUBBING AND SCRAPING IT
SIMPLY A REDDISH BROWN CIRCULAR SPECK ON THE BRIGHT GREEN ORANGE LEAF AND BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T WALK SHE HAD TO GET ALL HER FOOD IN A PECULIAR WAY SHE HAD A LONG THAT IS LONG FOR SUCH A TINY CREATURE SLENDER
WHICH IT WAS THOUGHT SHE MET WITH FROM HER CONSORT THE SITUATION OF THE KING'S AFFAIRS BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD
AND NOW HE FELT THANKFUL THAT HE HAD COME ALIVE THROUGH THESE SERIES OF WORLD CATASTROPHES AND CONVULSIONS AND STILL HAD ALL THE FOOD HE COULD POSSIBLY USE AFTER A FEW DAYS
AN ENTIRE COLONY OF THOSE STRANGE LITTLE PEOPLE THE ORANGE DWELLERS WERE KILLED IN OUR TOWN YESTERDAY MORNING AND NOT A NEWSPAPER REPORTER FOUND IT OUT JUST ONE OF THE ORANGE DWELLERS ESCAPED
PERFECTLY QUALIFIED TO SECOND HIS RAPACIOUS AND TYRANNICAL INCLINATIONS AND TO PREY UPON HIS DEFENCELESS PEOPLE THESE INSTRUMENTS OF OPPRESSION WERE BOTH LAWYERS THE FIRST OF MEAN BIRTH OF BRUTAL MANNERS
AND DID MY MOTHER STARVE TO DEATH TOO HE SOBBED NOT AT ALL LITTLE ONE RATHER IMPATIENTLY EXCLAIMED THE OTHER LITTLE CITRINUS SEEMED TO KNOW SO VERY LITTLE INDEED YOUR MOTHER WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE ME
THE MORE READILY AS HE WAS GETTING RATHER TIRED WITH HIS LONG TRAVELING AND A SORT OF SLEEPY FEELING WAS COMING OVER HIM SO THRUSTING HIS BEAK FAR INTO THE BALL
AND HIS CONTINUED SUCCESSES OVER DOMESTIC ENEMIES
WHICH WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF RANK QUALITY OR SERVICES
TOGETHER WITH SUFFOLK HIMSELF FOR HIS PRETENDED REBELLION BUT AFTER THAT TRAITOR HAD PERFORMED ALL THE SERVICES EXPECTED FROM HIM
AND FINALLY STOP ON SOME NICE GREEN LEAF OR JUICY ORANGE AND STICK OUR BEAKS FAR IN AND GO TO SLEEP OR DO SOMETHING VERY LIKE IT WE NEVER WALK ABOUT ANY MORE INDEED
A VERY CRUEL AND WICKED BEING AND RESOLVED TO WARN EVERY ORANGE DWELLER HE MET IN HIS TRAVELS TO BEWARE OF THE CRUEL TURTLE SHAPED BEAST WITH THE SHINING BLACK AND RED BACK
STILL MARY SAYS THAT OF COURSE CITRINUS CAN TALK
SEEMED ENTITLED TO DISPUTE WITH FERDINAND THE PRESENT POSSESSION OF THAT KINGDOM HENRY KNEW THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS OWN PRETENSIONS BY THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER
BUT LIVE ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND DIE HERE HOWEVER I AM GETTING TOO FAR ALONG IN MY STORY WHILE WE ARE ASLEEP WE SHED ALL OF OUR SKIN
JUST AS CITRINUS WAS PULLING HIS BEAK OUT OF THE SOFT LEAF HE SAW A GREAT SIX LEGGED BEAST IN SHAPE LIKE A TURTLE WITH SHINING RED AND BLACK BACK AND FEARFUL SNAPPING JAWS ON EACH SIDE OF ITS HEAD
AND MARRIED TO THE LADY CATHARINE SISTER OF THE QUEEN WILLIAM DE LA POLE BROTHER TO THE EARL OF SUFFOLK
UPON INFORMATION SECRETLY CONVEYED BY CURSON
AND SIR JAMES WINDHAM WITH SOME PERSONS OF INFERIOR QUALITY AND HE COMMITTED THEM TO CUSTODY LORD ABERGAVENNY AND SIR THOMAS GREEN WERE ALSO APPREHENDED BUT WERE SOON AFTER RELEASED FROM THEIR CONFINEMENT
HE DIRECTED SIR ROBERT CURSON GOVERNOR OF THE CASTLE OF HAMMES TO DESERT HIS CHARGE AND TO INSINUATE HIMSELF INTO THE CONFIDENCE OF SUFFOLK BY MAKING HIM A TENDER OF HIS SERVICES
PHILIP'S FATHER AS WELL AS IN FERDINAND HIS FATHER IN LAW BY THE COUNSEL THEREFORE OF THESE MONARCHS
WHOM THEY REGARDED AS THE CHIEF COUNTERPOISE TO THE GREATNESS OF FRANCE NO PARTICULAR PLAN HOWEVER
THE GREATER PART OF THE NATION WAS CONVINCED OF THE SUPERIORITY OF HIS WIFE'S TITLE
HE MET MANY OTHER ORANGE DWELLERS WHOM HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ALL ABOUT THE BEETLE BUT HE FOUND THAT ALL OF THEM HAD HAD EXPERIENCES AS SAD AS HIS IN FACT HE SOON LEARNED THAT OF ALL THE ORANGE DWELLERS WHO ARE BORN
HE WALKED OUT ON TO THE SHINING SURFACE OF THE ORANGE FOR OF COURSE THAT IS WHAT THE YELLOW BALL WAS HE TRIED A DRINK OF SAP FROM THE BALL AND FOUND IT DELICIOUS HE DECIDED TO STAY ON THE BALL
HE WANDERED AIMLESSLY ABOUT UNTIL HE CAME TO A LARGE YELLOW BALL HANGING FROM THE BRANCH WHICH GAVE OUT A DELIGHTFUL ODOR SCRAMBLING DOWN THE SLENDER STEM BY WHICH IT WAS SUSPENDED
HAD SOME YEARS BEFORE KILLED A MAN IN A SUDDEN FIT OF PASSION AND HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO APPLY TO THE KING FOR A REMISSION OF THE CRIME THE KING HAD GRANTED HIS REQUEST BUT BEING LITTLE INDULGENT TO ALL PERSONS CONNECTED WITH THE HOUSE OF YORK
DIED ABOUT THIS TIME AND IT WAS FORESEEN THAT BY THIS INCIDENT
BETWEEN ARTHUR PRINCE OF WALES AND THE INFANTA CATHARINE FOURTH DAUGHTER OF FERDINAND AND ISABELLA HE NEAR SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE SHE EIGHTEEN BUT THIS MARRIAGE PROVED IN THE ISSUE UNPROSPEROUS
FELL UPON SIR JAMES WINDHAM AND SIR JAMES TYRREL WHO WERE BROUGHT TO THEIR TRIAL CONDEMNED AND EXECUTED THE FATE OF THE LATTER GAVE GENERAL SATISFACTION ON ACCOUNT OF HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE MURDER OF THE YOUNG PRINCES
FOR THIS TIME WE LOSE OUR SUCKING BEAKS BUT WE REGAIN OUR SIX LEGS AND IN ADDITION WE GET A SECOND PAIR OF EYES WE FIND ON OUR HEADS A PAIR OF LONG SLENDER HAIRY FEELERS
LOOKING JUST AS I DO NOW OUR SISTERS THOUGH WHEN THEY SHED THEIR SKINS THE SECOND TIME MAKE NO CHANGE IN THEIR BODIES EXCEPT TO GROW LARGER THEY REMAIN WITH THEIR SUCKING BEAKS THRUST INTO THE LEAF
AND RETURNED AT LAST INTO THE LOW COUNTRIES WHERE HE WAS PROTECTED THOUGH NOT COUNTENANCED BY PHILIP THEN IN CLOSE ALLIANCE WITH THE KING
HAD THE KING BEEN EMPOWERED TO LEVY GENERAL TAXES AT PLEASURE HE WOULD NATURALLY HAVE ABSTAINED FROM THESE OPPRESSIVE EXPEDIENTS WHICH DESTROYED ALL SECURITY IN PRIVATE PROPERTY
DON'T YOU SEE I HAVE NOTHING TO EAT WITH NO SUCKING BEAK NO MOUTH AT ALL WHEN I GET MY WINGS AND MY FOUR EYES I LOSE MY MOUTH AND CAN'T EAT OR DRINK ANY MORE THIS WAS INCREDIBLE
AND BEGAT A UNIVERSAL DIFFIDENCE THROUGHOUT THE NATION IN VAIN
YES BEFORE MY LITTLE ORANGE DWELLER CHILDREN ARE BORN WHAT CRIED CITRINUS ARE YOU AN ORANGE DWELLER YOU WHO ARE SO DIFFERENT FROM ME INDEED I AM REPLIED THE GAUZY WINGED CREATURE
AND INSTEAD OF BEING SORRY FOR ITS VICTIMS WE ARE GLAD IT EATS THEM THIS SEEMS VERY CRUEL INDEED BUT THERE ARE SO MANY MANY MILLIONS OF THE ORANGE DWELLERS ALL SUCKING THE JUICE OF ORANGE TREES THAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SO SMALL
ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE EUROPEAN PRINCES BOTH IN WAR AND NEGOTIATION WERE TURNED TO THE SIDE OF ITALY
NOW THIS BEAST WHICH SEEMED SO LARGE TO CITRINUS WAS WHAT IS TO US A VERY SMALL AND PRETTY INSECT ONE OF THE LADY BIRD BEETLES
AND TO LEAD IN PERSON HIS FORCES AGAINST THE INFIDELS THE GENERAL FRENZY FOR CRUSADES WAS NOW ENTIRELY EXHAUSTED IN EUROPE BUT IT WAS STILL THOUGHT A NECESSARY PIECE OF DECENCY TO PRETEND ZEAL FOR THOSE PIOUS ENTERPRISES
HOW LONG HE SLEPT HE DOESN'T KNOW BUT WHEN HE AWOKE HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HIS SENSES HE HAD NO LEGS AND ON HIS BACK THERE WAS A THIN SHELL OF WAX AND A LITTLE PACKET HE REALIZED TOO
WITH THAT THE WINGED ORANGE DWELLER FLEW AWAY AND LITTLE CITRINUS WAS LEFT ALONE WONDERING OVER THE STRANGE STORY AFTER TAKING A DRINK OF SAP FROM THE LEAF ON WHICH HE WAS STANDING
WHEN AN OUTLAWRY IN A PERSONAL ACTION WAS ISSUED AGAINST ANY MAN HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO PURCHASE HIS CHARTER OF PARDON EXCEPT ON THE PAYMENT OF A GREAT SUM AND IF HE REFUSED THE COMPOSITION REQUIRED OF HIM
HE CAME TO THAT TOWN FINDING THAT PHILIP IN ORDER TO RELIEVE HIS SICKNESS AND FATIGUE WAS ALREADY COME ASHORE
ALL PASSED IN GENERAL PROFESSIONS OF AFFECTION AND REGARD AT LEAST IN REMOTE PROJECTS OF A CLOSER UNION BY THE FUTURE INTERMARRIAGES OF THEIR CHILDREN
AND UNEASY FROM DEBTS WHICH HE HAD CONTRACTED BY HIS GREAT EXPENSE AT PRINCE ARTHUR'S WEDDING HE AGAIN MADE AN ELOPEMENT INTO FLANDERS THE KING
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WASN'T VERY FAST THE BEAST LEISURELY CAUGHT UP IN ITS GREAT JAWS ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF CITRINUS'S BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND CRUSHED AND TORE THEIR TENDER BODIES TO PIECES AND ATE THEM
THAT IS THE COMMON STORY AMONG US ORANGE DWELLERS OUR FATHERS AND MOTHERS ALWAYS DIE BEFORE WE ARE BORN
WHEN MY BROTHER BEGAN TO SCRAPE OFF THE SPECKS I HASTILY INTERFERED BUT ONLY IN TIME TO SAVE ONE OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE CITRINUS WHOM AS I HAVE SAID MARY HAS SINCE FAITHFULLY CARED FOR
AND TO GIVE HIM A SUITABLE RECEPTION IN HIS DOMINIONS PHILIP KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT NOW DEPART WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT AND THEREFORE FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH
SHE LAYS A LOT OF EGGS UNDER HER BODY AND THEN DIES AND SOON THE NEW FAMILY IS BORN NOW THIS IS THE WAY WE GROW AND ALL OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS WHICH HAVE HAPPENED TO ME WILL HAPPEN TO YOU IF THE BEETLE DOES NOT GET YOU
THEY ARE NOT REALLY PEOPLE THEY ARE INSECTS
WHICH RENDERED IT INCONVENIENT FOR HIM TO EXPOSE HIS PERSON IN DEFENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN CAUSE HE PROMISED HOWEVER
AND WITH WHOM WE BECAME VERY WELL ACQUAINTED
WE CALL THEM INJURIOUS INSECTS WHILE WE CALL THE INSECT EATING KINDS BENEFICIAL INSECTS BECAUSE THEY DESTROY THE INJURIOUS INSECTS BUT LITTLE CITRINUS DIDN'T LOOK AT THE MATTER AT ALL IN THIS LIGHT HE THOUGHT THE LADY BIRD BEETLE
WHERE THE INTERESTS OF THE PARTIES IN THE LEAST INTERFERE SUCH WAS THE SITUATION OF HENRY AND FERDINAND THAT NO JEALOUSY EVER ON ANY OCCASION AROSE BETWEEN THEM THE KING HAD NOW THE SATISFACTION OF COMPLETING A MARRIAGE
URGED CITRINUS WHO FELT VERY BADLY TO THINK OF ANY ONE'S GOING WITHOUT FOOD FOR THREE DAYS HE ALWAYS TOOK A DRINK OF SAP EVERY FEW MINUTES WHY HOW ABSURD
NOW I SHALL PROBABLY DIE TO MORROW OR NEXT DAY BECAUSE I HAVE LIVED THREE DAYS ALREADY AND THAT IS A LONG TIME TO LIVE WITHOUT EATING
AND BY HIS WHOLE BEHAVIOR EXPRESSED A STRONG DESIRE OF CONCILIATING THE FRIENDSHIP OF ENGLAND THE DUKE OF ORLEANS HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE CROWN OF FRANCE
NEGLECTED NOT THIS INCIDENT WHICH MIGHT BECOME OF IMPORTANCE AND HE EMPLOYED
THE STRICT LAW WHICH IN SUCH CASES ALLOWS FORFEITURE OF GOODS WAS RIGOROUSLY INSISTED ON NAY
FINALLY CITRINUS CAME TO A REMARKABLE BEING A VERY BEAUTIFUL BEING INDEED IT HAD TWO LONG SLENDER WAVING FEELERS ON ITS HEAD FOUR LARGE BALL SHAPED EYES AND STRANGEST OF ALL
THEN THE MATTER IS AT AN END REPLIED THE KING FOR I WILL TAKE THAT DISHONOR UPON ME AND SO YOUR HONOR IS SAVED
I AM AN OLD ORANGE DWELLER
AND THE INFANT DID NOT LONG SURVIVE HER THIS PRINCESS WAS DESERVEDLY A FAVORITE OF THE NATION AND THE GENERAL AFFECTION FOR HER INCREASED ON ACCOUNT OF THE HARSH TREATMENT
HENRY NEGLECTED NOT THE PRESENT OPPORTUNITY OF COMPLAINING TO HIS GUEST OF THE RECEPTION WHICH SUFFOLK HAD MET WITH IN HIS DOMINIONS
OVER HER BACK AND AFTER THE EGGS WERE LAID SHE SOON DIED AND HER BODY SHRIVELED UP LEAVING THE EGGS SAFELY HOUSED UNDER THE WAXEN ROOF WHEN THE BABY ORANGE DWELLERS WERE HATCHED
WHICH IS CITRINUS THE ORANGES ON WHICH CITRINUS AND A GREAT MANY OF HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND COUSINS LIVED GREW IN MEXICO AND WHEN THESE ORANGES WERE RIPE THEY WERE GATHERED AND PACKED INTO BOXES AND SENT TO OUR TOWN
AND OFFERED TO HOLD HENRY'S STIRRUP A MARK OF CONDESCENSION WHICH THAT PRINCE WOULD NOT ADMIT OF HE CALLED THE KING FATHER PATRON PROTECTOR
TO OBSERVE SO FAR THE APPEARANCE OF LAW AS TO GIVE INDICTMENTS TO THOSE WHOM THEY INTENDED TO OPPRESS UPON WHICH THE PERSONS WERE COMMITTED TO PRISON BUT NEVER BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND WERE AT LENGTH OBLIGED IN ORDER TO RECOVER THEIR LIBERTY
SHE HAD THUS A CONSTANT SUPPLY OF FOOD ALWAYS READY AND CONVENIENT WHENEVER SHE WAS HUNGRY SHE SIMPLY SUCKED ORANGE SAP INTO HER MOUTH UNTIL SHE WAS SATISFIED THIS IS THE WAY ALL THE ORANGE DWELLERS GET THEIR FOOD
THAT IS ALL AN ORANGE DWELLER SEEMS TO BE WHEN CARELESSLY LOOKED AT SIMPLY A LITTLE CIRCULAR SCALE LIKE BLACKISH OR REDDISH BROWN SPECK ON THE SHINING SURFACE OF THE ORANGE HIS WORLD YOU CAN FIND THE ORANGE DWELLERS ALMOST ANY MORNING AT BREAKFAST
COMING UP TO THE GROUP BRANDON TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND WITH A GRACEFUL LITTLE BOW THAT LET THE CURLS FALL AROUND HIS FACE ASKED HAVE I THE HONOR TO FIND THE PRINCESS MARY AMONG THESE LADIES MARY
MARY SPRANG TO HER FEET WITH AN ANGRY FLUSH IN HER FACE EXCLAIMING INSOLENT FELLOW I AM THE PRINCESS MARY IF YOU HAVE A MESSAGE DELIVER IT AND BE GONE
AND ON THIS BALCONY WAS STANDING A LOVELY YOUNG MAIDEN SOUL
THERE IS NOTHING IN LIFE WORTH HAVING COMPARED WITH IT FOR ALL ITS PAINS AND AGONIES IS THERE NOW IF YOU MUST LOVE SOMEBODY CONTINUED THE PRINCESS
LET YOUR WIVES TO MORROW MORNING BAKE ME SOFT WHITE BREAD IVAN RETURNED HOME AND HE WAS NOT HAPPY AND HIS IMPETUOUS HEAD HUNG DOWN LOWER THAN HIS SHOULDERS QUA QUA IVAN TSAREVICH
AND I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THESE MY TWO BEST LOVED FRIENDS ACQUAINTED HOW DO YOU DO MASTER BRANDON SAID LADY JANE HOLDING OUT HER PLUMP LITTLE HAND SO WHITE AND SOFT AND DEAR TO ME
WHICH WOULD NOT DO TO WRITE DOWN HERE HE WAS AS LITTLE OF A BOASTER AS ANY MAN I EVER MET AND WHILE I AM IN THE TRUTH TELLING BUSINESS I WAS AS GREAT A BRAGGART OF MY INCHES AS EVER DREW THE LONG BOW IN THAT LINE I MEAN
FOR ALL OF WHICH SURELY THE PRINCE OF FAULT FINDERS HIMSELF COULD IN NO WAY BLAME HER SHE COULD NOT HELP THAT GOD HAD SEEN FIT TO MAKE HER THE FAIREST BEING ON EARTH
YOU CANNOT KNOW IN WHAT CONTEMPT A WOMAN HOLDS A MAN WHO FOLLOWS HER THOUGH SHE DESPISES HIM NO MAN CAN BEG A WOMAN'S LOVE HE MUST COMMAND IT DO NOT JOIN THEIR RANKS BUT LET US BE GOOD FRIENDS
WHO I KNOW YOU WILL AT ONCE SAY WAS THOROUGHLY SPOILED WITHOUT TURNING HER FACE TOWARD HIM REPLIED IS THE PRINCESS MARY A PERSON OF SO LITTLE CONSEQUENCE ABOUT THE COURT THAT SHE IS NOT KNOWN TO A MIGHTY CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD
AND NOW THE ELDER BRIDES BEGAN DANCING THEY WAVED THEIR LEFT HANDS AND ALL THE GUESTS WERE SQUIRTED WITH WATER THEY WAVED THEIR RIGHT HANDS AND THE BONES FLEW RIGHT INTO THE TSAR'S EYES THE TSAR WAS WROTH
I WILL TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT WERE WE BOTH OF THE SAME DEGREE EVEN THEN I COULD NOT FEEL TOWARD YOU AS YOU THINK YOU WISH BUT I CAN BE YOUR FRIEND AND WILL PROMISE TO BE THAT ALWAYS
I HAD AS I HAVE SAID TOLD HIM THE STORY OF MARY WITH SOME SLIGHT VARIATIONS AND COLORING OR RATHER DISCOLORING
I WAS UPON TERMS OF INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP WITH MARY AND WAS THE AVOWED AND AS I THOUGHT AT LEAST HOPED ALL BUT ACCEPTED LOVER OF HER FIRST LADY IN WAITING AND DEAREST FRIEND LADY JANE BOLINGBROKE
AND THE RESPONSIBILITY WOULD HAVE TO LIE WHERE IT BELONGED WITH GOD MARY WOULD HAVE NONE OF IT HER ATTRACTIVENESS WAS NOT A MATTER OF VOLITION OR INTENTION ON HER PART SHE WAS TOO YOUNG FOR DELIBERATE SNARE SETTING
WILL YOUR LADYSHIP SAY TO HER HIGHNESS THAT HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN AWAITS HER COMING AT THE MARBLE LANDING NO NEED TO REPEAT THE MESSAGE JANE CRIED MARY
AND HIS PREMIER PEER OF THE REALM THE NEXT BEST WHEN THE KING IS A CATHOLIC I GO TO MASS SINCE PRAISED BE THE LORD
AND WHY DISPUTE ABOUT THE VARIOUS WAYS OF SAVING ONE'S SOUL WHEN YOU ARE NOT EVEN SURE YOU HAVE A SOUL TO SAVE WHEN I OPEN MY MOUTH FOR PUBLIC UTTERANCE THE KING IS THE BEST MAN IN CHRISTENDOM
AND IT WAS SUCH A WONDROUS CARPET THAT THE LIKE OF IT CAN ONLY BE TOLD IN TALES BUT MAY NEITHER BE IMAGINED NOR GUESSED AT THE CARPET WAS ADORNED WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND WITH DIVERS BRIGHT EMBROIDERINGS
THE MEETING CAME ABOUT SOONER THAN I EXPECTED AND WAS VERY NEAR A FAILURE IT WAS ON THE SECOND MORNING AFTER MARY'S ARRIVAL AT GREENWICH BRANDON AND I WERE WALKING IN THE PALACE PARK WHEN WE MET JANE
I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOU THE LAST DAY OR SO FROM SIR EDWIN BUT HAD BEGUN TO FEAR HE WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE ME THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING YOU I HOPE I MAY SEE YOU OFTEN NOW AND THAT I MAY PRESENT YOU TO MY MISTRESS WITH THIS
AND WHEN HE COMES BE IT LATE OR EARLY SHE CROWNS HIM EVEN THOUGH HE BE A LONG EARED ASS
WHEREUPON THE DUCK LAID AN EGG AND THE EGG FELL INTO THE SEA IVAN SEEING THE IRREPARABLE LOSS OF THE EGG BURST INTO TEARS WHEN SUDDENLY THE PIKE CAME SWIMMING ASHORE HOLDING THE EGG BETWEEN ITS TEETH
DON'T BELIEVE ONE WORD SHE SAYS SIR EDWIN CRIED LADY JANE IF YOU DO I NEVER WILL LIKE YOU THE EMPHASIS ON THE WILL HELD OUT SUCH INVOLUNTARY PROMISE IN CASE I DID NOT BELIEVE THE PRINCESS
BUT FIND A CONTINUAL TENDENCY ON THE PART OF MY OWN STORY TO INTRUDE FOR EVERY MAN IS A VERY IMPORTANT PERSONAGE TO HIMSELF I SHALL HOWEVER TRY TO KEEP IT OUT IN THE COURSE OF MY TALK WITH BRANDON
THAT VERY ATTRACTIVE BRANCH OF NATURAL HISTORY WOMAN WAS A FAVORITE TOPIC AND WE ACCORDINGLY DISCUSSED IT A GREAT DEAL THAT IS TO TELL THE EXACT TRUTH I DID ALTHOUGH BRANDON HAD SEEN MANY AN ADVENTURE DURING HIS LIFE ON THE CONTINENT
AND TOLERANCE OF RELIGIOUS THOUGHT WE BELIEVED THAT THESE THINGS WOULD YET COME IN SPITE OF KINGCRAFT AND PRIESTCRAFT BUT WISELY KEPT OUR PET THEORIES TO OURSELVES
BEING NO LESS THAN THE CAPACITY FOR SAYING NOTHING AND LISTENING POLITELY TO AN INFINITE DEAL OF THE SAME THING IN ANOTHER FORM FROM ME I REMEMBER THAT I TOLD HIM I HAD KNOWN THE PRINCESS MARY FROM A TIME WHEN SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
THE GUESTS WERE ALL TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED AND RUSHED FROM THEIR PLACES AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO BUT IVAN SAID FEAR NOT TIS ONLY MY LITTLE FROGGY COMING IN HER LITTLE BASKET
WHY HAST THOU COME HITHER WITHOUT THY WIFE WHY THOU MIGHTEST HAVE BROUGHT HER WITH THEE IN A KITCHEN CLOUT AND WHERE DIDST THOU PICK UP SUCH A BEAUTY
WHERE WE FOUND THE QUEEN AND SOME OF HER LADIES AWAITING THE REST OF THEIR PARTY FOR A TRIP DOWN THE RIVER WHICH HAD BEEN PLANNED THE DAY BEFORE BRANDON WAS KNOWN TO THE QUEEN AND SEVERAL OF THE LADIES ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT BEEN FORMALLY PRESENTED AT AN AUDIENCE
YOU MAY BE SURE THIS SORT OF TREATMENT WAS SUCH AS THE COOL HEADED DARING BRANDON WOULD REPAY WITH USURY SO TURNING UPON HIS HEEL AND ALMOST PRESENTING HIS BACK TO MARY HE SPOKE TO LADY JANE
HE WORE HIS GUARDSMAN'S DOUBLET AND SHE KNEW HIS RANK BY HIS UNIFORM SHE HAD NOT NOTICED HIS FACE QUICK AS A FLASH CAME THE ANSWER I CAN NOT SAY OF WHAT CONSEQUENCE THE PRINCESS MARY IS ABOUT THE COURT
THAT I AT ONCE PROTESTED TOTAL WANT OF FAITH IN A SINGLE SYLLABLE SHE HAD SAID ABOUT HER AND VOWED THAT I KNEW IT COULD NOT BE TRUE THAT I DARED NOT HOPE FOR SUCH HAPPINESS YOU SEE
YOU COULD FORM SOME IDEA OF MARY'S POWERS BY THAT ACHIEVEMENT ALONE WILL SOMMERS THE FOOL
FOR A NOBLE THOUGH AN IDIOT TO THE MOST OF ENGLAND WAS A NOBLE STILL GOD CREATED AND TO BE ADORED ANOTHER GREAT BOND OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN BRANDON AND MYSELF
IF YOU WILL PROMISE NEVER AGAIN TO SPEAK OF THIS TO ME I PROMISED SOLEMNLY AND HAVE ALWAYS KEPT MY WORD AS THIS TRUE GRACIOUS WOMAN SO FULL OF FAULTS AND BEAUTIES VIRTUES AND FAILINGS HAS
ELSE THERE WERE FEWER CORONATIONS SO BRANDON STIRRED THIS ANTAGONISM AND DETERMINED NOT TO SEE HER MANIFOLD PERFECTIONS WHICH HE FELT SURE WERE EXAGGERATED
IN A CERTAIN KINGDOM IN A CERTAIN EMPIRE THERE LIVED A TSAR WITH HIS TSARITSA AND HE HAD THREE SONS ALL OF THEM YOUNG VALIANT AND UNWEDDED
FOR IN A NATURE LIKE HERS CHARGED WITH LATENT FORCE STRONG AND HOT AND FIERY AS THE SUN'S STORED RAYS IT NEEDED BUT A FLASH TO MAKE IT PATENT WHEN DAMAGE WAS SURE TO FOLLOW FOR SOMEBODY PROBABLY BRANDON
FIE THOU OLD HAG THOU CALL'ST ME A GOOD YOUTH BUT THOU SHOULDST FIRST FEED AND GIVE ME DRINK AND PREPARE ME A BATH THEN ONLY SHOULDST THOU ASK ME QUESTIONS THE BABA YAGA FED HIM AND GAVE HIM TO DRINK
WHEREFORE ART THOU SO SAD ASKED THE FROG OR HAST THOU HEARD UNPLEASANT WORDS FROM THY FATHER THE TSAR WHY SHOULD I NOT BE SAD MY FATHER AND SOVEREIGN LORD HATH COMMANDED THEE TO BAKE SOFT WHITE BREAD TO MORROW
AND THE BEST I COULD HOPE WAS THAT SHE HELD ME ON PROBATION ON THE EVENING OF THE DAY MARY CAME HOME TO GREENWICH BRANDON ASKED WHO AND WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS WONDERFUL MARY I HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT
THE TRUTH IS SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN KIND AND COURTEOUS TO ME AND HAD ADMITTED ME TO A DEGREE OF INTIMACY MUCH GREATER THAN I DESERVED THIS PARTLY AT LEAST
AND SAW HER SMILE AND TRY TO CHECK THE COMING LAUGH THEN CAME A LOOK OF OFFENDED DIGNITY FOLLOWED BY A QUICK SOFTENING GLANCE LEAVE ME ONE FRIEND I PRAY YOU EDWIN I VALUE YOU TOO HIGHLY TO LOSE
AS NEITHER HIS DUTIES NOR MINE WERE ONEROUS WE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ON OUR HANDS WHICH WE EMPLOYED WALKING AND RIDING OR SITTING IN OUR COMMON ROOM READING AND TALKING OF COURSE AS WITH MOST YOUNG MEN
THE OTHER HARE BOUNDED OFF IN PURSUIT HUNTED HIM DOWN AND TORE HIM TO BITS OUT OF THE HARE FLEW A DUCK AND ROSE HIGH HIGH IN THE AIR BUT THE OTHER DUCK
IVAN HAD PITY UPON HER AND WENT ON FARTHER TO THE BLUE SEA AND BEHOLD ON THE BEACH LAY GASPING A PIKE ALAS TSAREVICH IVAN SIGHED THE PIKE HAVE PITY ON ME AND CAST ME INTO THE SEA
GODS I FLUSH UP HOT EVEN NOW WHEN I THINK OF IT SO I TALKED A GREAT DEAL AND FOUND MYSELF INFINITELY PLEASED WITH BRANDON'S CONVERSATIONAL POWERS WHICH WERE RARE
THOUGH IT OFTEN BEGINS VERY EARLY IN LIFE AND MADE NO EFFORT TO ATTRACT MEN MAN'S LOVE WAS TOO CHEAP A THING FOR HER TO STRIVE FOR AND I AM SURE IN HER HEART
THE FROG TSAREVNA
AND BEHOLD THE ELDER BROTHERS APPEARED TO BE INSPECTED WITH THEIR RICHLY ATTIRED AND SPLENDIDLY ADORNED CONSORTS THERE THEY STOOD AND LAUGHED AT THE TSAREVICH IVAN AND SAID WHY BROTHER
THEN HEIR TO THE GREATEST INHERITANCE THAT EVER FELL TO THE LOT OF ONE MAN SPAIN THE NETHERLANDS AUSTRIA AND HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WHAT ELSE
BUT THE WINNING OF JANE WAS NOT SO EASY A MATTER AS MY VANITY HAD PROMPTED ME TO THINK I STARTED WITH A HANDICAP
AND WAS SOON LOST TO SIGHT BEHIND THE SHRUBBERY AT THE TURNING OF THE WALK IN A SHORT TIME WE CAME TO A SUMMER HOUSE NEAR THE MARBLE BOAT LANDING
I WELL KNEW THE INFINITE DISTANCE BETWEEN US BUT LIKE EVERY OTHER MAN WHO CAME WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF THIS CHARMING LODESTONE I LOST MY HEAD AND IN SHORT MADE A GREATER FOOL OF MYSELF THAN I NATURALLY WAS
THE LOAVES WERE ADORNED WITH VARIOUS CUNNING DEVICES ROYAL CITIES WERE MODELLED ON THE SIDES THEREOF WITH MOATS AND DITCHES THE TSAR PRAISED IVAN GREATLY BECAUSE OF HIS BREAD AND GAVE THIS COMMAND TO HIS THREE SONS
SHE WAS A MOST ADROIT COAXER AND KNEW HER POWER FULL WELL ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT ALWAYS PLEAD HAVING THE TUDOR TEMPER AND PREFERRING TO COMMAND WHEN SHE COULD AS BEFORE HINTED
IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO DETERMINE SUCH MATTERS I AM SURE HOWEVER SHE IS NOT HERE FOR I DOUBT NOT SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN A GENTLE ANSWER TO A MESSAGE FROM THE QUEEN I SHALL CONTINUE MY SEARCH WITH THIS
A ROAD SHE TRAVELED AT AN EAGER GALLOP FOR SHE DEARLY LOVED TO LEARN FROM CURIOSITY PERHAPS I AM SURE SHE HELD ME IN HER LIGHT GENTLE HEART AS A DEAR FRIEND BUT WHILE HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH THIS MILD WARMTH FOR ME
BUT IN FACT HARMLESS OPERATION OF WHEEDLING THE KING OUT OF HIS EARS
WHAT DOST THOU SEEK AND WHITHER ART THOU GOING THE TSAREVICH TOLD HIM ALL HIS MISFORTUNE ALAS TSAREVICH IVAN WHY DIDST THOU BURN THAT FROG SKIN THOU DIDST NOT MAKE
AND ESTEEM YOU TOO MUCH TO TORMENT DO NOT MAKE OF YOURSELF ONE OF THOSE FOOLS WHO FEEL OR PRETEND TO FEEL I CARE NOT WHICH SUCH PREFERENCE FOR ME
SET TO WORK AND WEAVE ME A SILK CARPET SUCH AS I WAS WONT TO SIT UPON AT MY DEAR FATHER'S NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE IN THE MORNING IVAN WOKE
THE TSAR GREATLY PRAISED IVAN FOR HIS CARPET AND THERE AND THEN GAVE THE NEW COMMAND THAT ALL THREE TSAREVICHES WERE TO APPEAR BEFORE HIM ON THE MORROW TO BE INSPECTED TOGETHER WITH THEIR WIVES
IVAN TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND LED HER BEHIND THE OAKEN TABLE BEHIND THE EMBROIDERED TABLECLOTH THE GUESTS BEGAN TO EAT AND DRINK AND MAKE MERRY THE LOVELY TSAREVNA DRANK WINE
AND IT IS NOT EASY TO SETTLE ACCOUNTS WITH KOSHCHEI HIS DEATH DEPENDS UPON THE POINT OF A NEEDLE THAT NEEDLE IS IN A HARE THAT HARE IS IN A COFFER THAT COFFER IS ON THE TOP OF A HIGH OAK
AND EXCEPT WHEN ANGRY WHICH ALAS WAS NOT INFREQUENT
UPON HER BEAUTIFUL BALCONY AND CRIED WITH A PIERCING VOICE NURSEYS NURSEYS ASSEMBLE SET TO WORK AND MAKE ME SOFT WHITE BREAD SUCH AS I MYSELF USED TO EAT AT MY DEAR FATHER'S IN THE MORNING IVAN AWOKE
THEY SAY SHE IS COMING HOME TO DAY AND THE COURT SEEMS TO HAVE GONE MAD ABOUT IT I HEAR NOTHING BUT MARY IS COMING MARY IS COMING MARY MARY FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT
MY DEAR CHILDREN TAKE UNTO YOU YOUR DARTS GIRD ON YOUR WELL SPANNED BOWS AND GO HENCE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND IN WHATSOEVER COURTS YOUR ARROWS FALL THERE CHOOSE YE YOUR BRIDES
BRANDON STARTED OFF AND SOON FOUND A BEVY OF GIRLS SITTING ON SOME BENCHES UNDER A SPREADING OAK WEAVING SPRING FLOWERS HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE PRINCESS SO COULD NOT POSITIVELY KNOW HER
AND APPARENTLY MADE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF DRIVING MANKIND DISTRACTED IN FACT THAT SEEMED TO BE THE PARAMOUNT OBJECT IN HER CREATION
HOW WHO CAN TELL THE BEAR RUSHED AT THE TREE AND TORE IT UP BY THE ROOTS THE COFFER FELL AND WAS SMASHED TO PIECES THE HARE LEAPED OUT AND WITH ONE BOUND HAD TAKEN COVER BUT LOOK
DO NOT AFFLICT THYSELF O TSAREVICH LIE DOWN AND REST THE MORNING IS WISER THAN THE EVENING SHE MADE THE TSAREVICH LIE DOWN AND REST THEN CASTING HER FROG SKIN SHE TURNED INTO A MAIDEN SOUL
ALL THAT HE HAD HEARD OF HER WONDERFUL POWER OVER MEN
AND MAN A POOR CONTEMPTIBLE CREATURE MADE TO GROVEL AT HER FEET NOT THAT SHE LIKED OR ENCOURAGED IT FOR NEVER HAVING BEEN MOVED HERSELF SHE HELD LOVE AND ITS SUFFERINGS IN UTTER SCORN
LET YOUR WIVES WEAVE ME A CARPET IN A SINGLE NIGHT IVAN RETURNED HOME AND HE WAS SAD AND HIS IMPETUOUS HEAD HUNG LOWER THAN HIS SHOULDERS QUA QUA TSAREVICH IVAN WHEREFORE ART THOU SO SAD
BUT THE BEAR IMPLORED HIM SLAY ME NOT TSAREVICH IVAN I MAY PERCHANCE BE OF SERVICE TO THEE SOMEHOW HE WENT ON FARTHER AND LO
AND THEN A GOLDEN COACH DRAWN BY SIX HORSES FLEW UP THE STEPS OF THE TSAR'S BALCONY AND OUT OF IT STEPPED SUCH A BEAUTY AS IS ONLY TO BE TOLD OF IN TALES
AND WHEN I FIRST SAW SIGNS OF A GROWING INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM I FELT FROM WHAT LITTLE I HAD SEEN OF BRANDON THAT THE TABLES WERE VERY LIKELY TO BE TURNED UPON HER LADYSHIP THEN THOUGHT I GOD HELP HER
AND THAT I WAS VERY EARNEST IN EVERYTHING I SAID TO HER BUT JANE'S EARS WOULD HAVE HEARD JUST AS MUCH HAD THEY BEEN THE PAIR OF BEAUTIFUL LITTLE SHELLS THEY SO MUCH RESEMBLED THIS TROUBLED ME A GREAT DEAL
SHE HAD BEEN MADE LOVE TO BY SO MANY MEN WHO HAD LOST THEIR SENSES IN THE DAZZLING RAYS OF HER THOUSAND PERFECTIONS OF WHOM I AM ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I FOR A TIME HAD BEEN INSANE ENOUGH TO BE ONE
FRET NOT TSAREVICH GO ALONE TO THE TSAR AND PAY THY VISIT AND I WILL COME AFTER THEE THE MOMENT YOU HEAR A RUMBLING AND A KNOCKING SAY HITHER COMES MY DEAR LITTLE FROGGY IN HER LITTLE BASKET
I TOLD HIM ALSO ABOUT JANE AND I GRIEVE AND BLUSH TO SAY EXPRESSED A CONFIDENCE IN THAT DIRECTION I LITTLE FELT IT HAD BEEN PERHAPS A YEAR SINCE MY ADVENTURE WITH MARY
THAT IS BETWEEN OURSELVES OF WHAT USE IS IT TO ARGUE THE EQUALITY OF HUMAN KIND TO A MAN WHO HONESTLY THINKS HE IS BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE OR TO ONE WHO REALLY BELIEVES THAT SOME ONE ELSE IS BETTER THAN HE
EVER SINCE THAT DAY AND MOMENT KEPT HERS IT SEEMED THAT MY LOVE OR WHAT I SUPPOSED WAS LOVE
AND I HAD TO UNDO ALL THAT BEFORE I COULD DO ANYTHING ELSE
HE TURNED TO LEAVE AND THE LADIES INCLUDING JANE WHO WAS THERE AND SAW IT ALL AND TOLD ME OF IT AWAITED THE BOLT THEY KNEW WOULD COME FOR THEY SAW THE LIGHTNING GATHERING IN MARY'S EYES
IT WAS A HAPPY THOUGHT FOR ME ONE OF THOSE WHICH COME TO A MAN NOW AND THEN AND FOR WHICH HE THANKS HIS WITS IN EVERY HOUR OF HIS AFTER LIFE
BRANDON IT IS TRUE WAS NOT NOBLE NOT EVEN AN ENGLISH KNIGHT WHILE I WAS BOTH KNIGHTED AND NOBLE BUT HE WAS OF AS OLD A FAMILY AS ENGLAND BOASTED AND NEAR OF KIN TO SOME OF THE BEST BLOOD OF THE LAND
I MIGHT AS WELL FALL IN LOVE WITH A TWINKLING STAR THEN BESIDES MY HEART IS NOT ON MY SLEEVE YOU MUST THINK ME A FOOL A POOR ENERVATED SIMPERING FOOL
AND BRANDON TOLD HER LADY JANE HAD SAID SHE WAS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GROUNDS THEREUPON HER MAJESTY ASKED BRANDON TO FIND THE PRINCESS AND TO SAY THAT SHE WAS WANTED
THAT IS UNTIL THE RIGHT ONE SHOULD COME THE RIGHT ONE IS ALWAYS ON HIS WAY AND FIRST OR LAST IS SURE TO COME TO EVERY WOMAN SOMETIMES ALAS TOO LATE
THE TSAREVICH BENT HIS BOW HE WOULD HAVE SHOT THE BIRD WHEN SUDDENLY SHE GREETED HIM WITH A HUMAN VOICE SLAY ME NOT IVAN TSAREVICH I ALSO WILL BEFRIEND THEE
MARY DID NOT COME HOME WITH US FROM WESTMINSTER THE MORNING AFTER THE JOUSTINGS AS WE HAD EXPECTED BUT FOLLOWED SOME FOUR OR FIVE DAYS LATER
BUT THE DREGS OF HER CUP SHE POURED BEHIND HER LEFT SLEEVE SHE ATE ALSO OF THE ROAST SWAN BUT THE BONES THEREOF SHE CONCEALED BEHIND HER RIGHT SLEEVE THE WIVES OF THE ELDER BROTHERS WATCHED THESE DEVICES AND TOOK CARE TO DO THE SAME
HER SKIN WAS LIKE VELVET A RICH CLEAR ROSY SNOW WITH THE HOT YOUNG BLOOD GLOWING THROUGH IT LIKE THE FAINT RED TINGE WE SOMETIMES SEE ON THE INNER SIDE OF A WHITE ROSE LEAF
AND HE CAST IT INTO THE SEA AND WENT ON ALONG THE SHORE THE BALL ROLLED A SHORT WAY AND IT ROLLED A LONG WAY AND AT LAST IT CAME TO A MISERABLE HUT THE HUT WAS STANDING ON HEN'S LEGS AND TURNING ROUND AND ROUND
WHICH IS SAYING A GOOD DEAL FOR THAT TIME IN MY LIFE GOD KNOWS I KNEW VAGUELY BUT DID NOT FAIRLY REALIZE HOW UTTERLY BEYOND MY REACH IN EVERY WAY SHE WAS UNTIL I OPENED THE FLOOD GATES OF MY PASSION AS I THOUGHT IT
SOCIALLY WHICH GOES WITH A FORMAL PRESENTATION THE QUEEN SEEING US SENT ME OFF TO BRING THE KING AFTER I HAD GONE SHE ASKED IF ANY ONE HAD SEEN THE PRINCESS MARY
MINE BEGAN TO BURN WITH THE FLAME THAT DISCOLORS EVERYTHING AND I SAW HER FRIENDLINESS IN A VERY DISTORTING LIGHT SHE WAS MUCH KINDER TO ME THAN TO MOST MEN BUT I DID NOT SEE THAT IT WAS BY REASON OF MY ABSOLUTE HARMLESSNESS
THE FROG HAD GOT THE BREAD READY LONG AGO AND IT WAS SO SPLENDID THAT THE LIKE OF IT IS NEITHER TO BE IMAGINED NOR GUESSED AT BUT IS ONLY TO BE TOLD OF IN TALES
NOR SHOULDST THOU THEREFORE HAVE DONE AWAY WITH IT VASILISA THY WIFE WAS BORN WISER AND MORE CUNNING THAN HER FATHER
AND THE YOUNGEST OF THEM WAS CALLED THE TSAREVICH IVAN FOOTNOTE SIXTEEN FROM RUSSIAN FAIRY TALES ADAPTED LONDON GEORGE G HARRAP AND COMPANY
HER GREATEST BEAUTY WAS HER GLOWING DARK BROWN EYES WHICH SHONE WITH AN EVER CHANGING LUSTER FROM BENEATH THE SHADE OF THE LONGEST BLACKEST UPCURVING LASHES EVER SEEN HER VOICE WAS SOFT AND FULL
LIKE LIKE WELL LIKE ONE OF THOSE NOBLES OF ENGLAND DON'T PUT ME DOWN WITH THEM CASKODEN IF YOU WOULD REMAIN MY FRIEND WE BOTH LAUGHED AT THIS SORT OF TALK WHICH WAS A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF THE TIME
SO YOU SEE I PAY A COMPLIMENT TO YOUR STRENGTH OF MIND NONSENSE BROKE IN BRANDON DO YOU THINK I LEFT ALL MY WITS DOWN IN SUFFOLK WHY MAN SHE IS THE SISTER OF THE KING AND IS SOUGHT BY KINGS AND EMPERORS
HAVE I NOT CAUSE TO GRIEVE MY FATHER AND SOVEREIGN LORD COMMANDS THEE TO WEAVE HIM A SILK CARPET IN A SINGLE NIGHT FRET NOT TSAREVICH COME LAY THEE DOWN AND SLEEP THE MORNING IS WISER THAN THE EVENING
AFTERWARD WHEN TSAREVNA BEGAN DANCING WITH IVAN SHE WAVED HER LEFT HAND AND A LAKE APPEARED SHE WAVED HER RIGHT HAND AND WHITE SWANS WERE SWIMMING IN THE WATER THE TSAR AND HIS GUESTS WERE ASTONISHED
MAN'S LOVE WAS SO CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL THAT IT HAD NO VALUE IN HER EYES AND IT LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD LOSE THE BEST THING IN LIFE BY HAVING TOO MUCH OF IT
TOOK VASILISA AND RETURNED HOME
SUCH WAS THE ROYAL MAID TO WHOSE TENDER MERCIES I NOW TELL YOU FRANKLY MY FRIEND BRANDON WAS SOON TO BE TURNED OVER HE HOWEVER WAS A BLADE OF VERY DIFFERENT TEMPER FROM ANY SHE HAD KNOWN
THEN SHE MADE HIM LIE DOWN TO SLEEP AND TURNING INTO THE LOVELY MAIDEN WENT FORTH UPON HER BEAUTIFUL BALCONY AND CRIED WITH A PIERCING VOICE NURSEYS NURSEYS ASSEMBLE
AND AFTER THE INTERCHANGE OF A FEW WORDS JANE SAID HER MISTRESS WAS WAITING AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GROUNDS AND THAT SHE MUST GO SHE THEN RAN OFF WITH A LAUGH AND A COURTESY
AS SHE SMILED UPON MY FIRST AVOWAL SOMEWHAT AS DISEASE MAY LEAVE THE SICKENED BODY UPON A GREAT SHOCK AND IN ITS PLACE CAME THE RESTFUL FLAME OF A FRIEND'S LOVE WHICH SO SOFTLY WARMS WITHOUT BURNING BUT THE BURNING
I FEAR I TRIED TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS HER EXALTED RANK ONLY WHICH MADE HER LOOK UNFAVORABLY UPON MY PASSION
HE WENT ALONG THE OPEN PLAIN AND THERE MET HIM A BEAR COME NOW THOUGHT IVAN
NOW ONE DAY THE TSAREVICH WAITED HIS OPPORTUNITY
AND MADE READY A BATH FOR HIM AND THE TSAREVICH TOLD HER HE WAS SEEKING HIS WIFE VASILISA I KNOW SAID THE BABA YAGA SHE IS NOW WITH KOSHCHEI TIS HARD TO GET THITHER
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THINE FOR EVER MORE
THEY SAY BUCKINGHAM IS BESIDE HIMSELF FOR LOVE OF HER HE HAS A WIFE AT HOME IF I AM RIGHT AND IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE HER FATHER IS HE NOT I ASSENTED AND BRANDON CONTINUED
ARRAS SILK SHE WAS OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WITH A FIGURE THAT VENUS MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
AND KOSHCHEI GUARDS THAT TREE AS THE APPLE OF HIS EYE THE BABA YAGA THEN SHOWED HIM IN WHAT PLACE THAT OAK GREW IVAN WENT THITHER BUT DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO TO GET AT THE COFFER SUDDENLY
HER EYES BRIGHT AS OVERGROWN DEW DROPS TWINKLED WITH A MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE SMILE AS IF TO SAY AH ANOTHER LARGE HANDSOME FELLOW TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF BRANDON ACQUIESCED IN THE WISH SHE HAD MADE
AND THEREFORE I HAD NOT BEEN MUCH HURT IN MARY'S CASE I HAD SUFFERED MERELY A TOUCH OF THE GENERAL EPIDEMIC NOT THE LINGERING CHRONIC DISEASE THAT KILLS
TIS THY FATE TO HAVE HER SO THE TSAREVICHES ALL GOT MARRIED THE ELDEST TO THE BOYAR'S DAUGHTER THE SECOND TO THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND THE YOUNGEST TO THE QUACKING FROG AND THE TSAR CALLED THEM TO HIM AND SAID
AND I HAD TAKEN ALL THAT TIME TRYING TO CONVINCE JANE THAT I DID NOT MEAN A WORD I HAD SAID TO HER MISTRESS
I BEG YOU TO SAY TO THE QUEEN THAT I SHALL BE WITH HER PRESENTLY
THE MEN OF THE COURT MUST BE POOR CREATURES HE HAD MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT THE POWER OF WOMANHOOD THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH BUT YOU KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS I DO WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE HER I ANSWERED
THEN TURNING TO BRANDON
NOW WHEN MARY RETURNED THE WHOLE COURT REJOICED AND I WAS ANXIOUS FOR BRANDON TO MEET HER AND THAT THEY SHOULD BECOME FRIENDS THERE WOULD BE NO TROUBLE IN BRINGING THIS MEETING ABOUT SINCE AS YOU KNOW
IVAN SAID TO IT LITTLE HUT LITTLE HUT STAND THE OLD WAY AS THY MOTHER PLACED THEE WITH THY FRONT TO ME AND THY BACK TO THE SEA AND THE LITTLE HUT TURNED ROUND WITH ITS FRONT TO HIM AND ITS BACK TO THE SEA
AND BADE HER BE A FROG FOR THREE YEARS HERE IS A LITTLE BALL FOR THEE FOLLOW IT WHITHERSOEVER IT ROLLS IVAN THANKED THE OLD MAN AND FOLLOWED AFTER THE BALL
AND I SUPPOSE BECAUSE I WAS A VAIN FOOL I GRADUALLY BEGAN TO GATHER HOPE WHICH GOES WITH EVERY VAIN MAN'S LOVE AND WHAT IS MORE ACTUALLY CLIMBED TO THE VERY APEX OF IDIOCY AND DECLARED MYSELF
AND YOU WILL BE ONE OF THEM ALSO I FLATTER YOU BY GIVING YOU ONE HOUR WITH HER TO BE HEELS OVER HEAD IN LOVE WITH AN ORDINARY MAN IT TAKES ONE SIXTIETH OF THAT TIME
HE TOOK THE EGG BROKE IT DREW OUT THE NEEDLE AND BROKE OFF ITS LITTLE POINT THEN HE ATTACKED KOSHCHEI WHO STRUGGLED HARD BUT WRIGGLE ABOUT AS HE MIGHT HE HAD TO DIE AT LAST THEN IVAN WENT INTO THE HOUSE OF KOSHCHEI
SOON THE TSAREVNA MISSED HER FROG SKIN WAS SORE TROUBLED FELL A WEEPING AND SAID TO THE TSAREVICH ALAS TSAREVICH IVAN WHAT HAST THOU DONE IF THOU HADST BUT WAITED FOR A LITTLE
THEN I KNEW THAT THE BEST CURE FOR THE STING WHICH LIES IN A LUCKLESS LOVE IS TO LOVE ELSEWHERE AND JANE AS SHE STOOD THERE SO PETITE SO BLUSHING AND SO FAIR STRUCK ME AS QUITE THE MOST PLEASING ANTIDOTE I COULD POSSIBLY FIND
BUT TO TREAT HER AS HE WOULD THE QUEEN WHO WAS BLACK AND LEATHERY ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN A SATYR WITH ALL RESPECT DUE TO HER RANK BUT WITH HIS OWN OPINION OF HER NEVERTHELESS SAFELY STORED AWAY IN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
HE WAS WRONG IN THIS BECAUSE MARY WAS NOT A COQUETTE IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD AND DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ATTRACT MEN EXCEPT TO BE SO BEAUTIFUL SWEET AND WINNING THAT THEY COULD NOT LET HER ALONE
THE TSAREVICH ENTERED IN AND SAW THE BONY LEGGED BABA YAGA LYING ON THE STOVE ON NINE BRICKS AND GRINDING HER TEETH HILLO GOOD YOUTH WHY DOST THOU VISIT ME ASKED THE BABA YAGA
THERE IS LADY JANE BOLINGBROKE WHO IS BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD AND ADMIRES YOU AND I THINK COULD LEARN TO
OR HAST THOU HEARD WORDS UNKIND FROM THY FATHER THE TSAR HAVE I NOT CAUSE TO BE SAD MY FATHER AND SOVEREIGN LORD HAS COMMANDED ME TO APPEAR BEFORE HIM WITH THEE TO MORROW HOW CAN I SHOW THEE TO PEOPLE
AGAIN IVAN RETURNED HOME AND HE WAS NOT HAPPY AND HIS IMPETUOUS HEAD HUNG LOWER THAN HIS SHOULDERS QUA QUA TSAREVICH IVAN WHEREFORE ART THOU GRIEVED
THE BOY BEGAN TO LOOK ROUND THIS TREE AND THE NEXT AND FINALLY MADE HIS WAY SOME LITTLE DISTANCE FARTHER INTO THE FOREST
AND A DEAD SILENCE FELL UPON THE GREAT GROUP OF FORESTERS WHO HAD PRESSED FORWARD AND WHO EAGERLY WATCHED THE SCENE BEFORE THEM IN THE SOFT AMBER SUNSHINE WHICH CAME SLANTING THROUGH THE TREES
SOME OF WHICH WERE BLEEDING THEN HE LISTENED AND FANCIED THAT HE HEARD SHOUTING WITH THE TRAMPLING OF MULES AND THE BREAKING OF TWIGS BUT HE WAS GIDDY AND PUZZLED AND AFTER STRUGGLING THROUGH SOME UNDERGROWTH HE SAT DOWN UPON WHAT LOOKED LIKE A GREEN VELVET CUSHION
NOW WON'T YOU GIVE EM TO ME CRIED THE HERD BOY AND HE WHIPPED OFF THE CAP AND THREW IT TO A LITTLE DISTANCE WITH THE RESULT THAT HALF A DOZEN PIGS RUSHED AT IT AND AS HE MADE A BRAVE FIGHT TO GET RID OF HIS ENEMY
ONLY I CAN'T THINK OF THEM YET LOOK HERE I FOUND THESE THE BOY TOOK SOME ROUND PRICKLY HUSKS OUT OF HIS POCKET CHESTNUTS EATING ONES
VOICES WERE HEARD AND THE BOY STOPPED YOU GO STRAIGHT ALONG THERE HE SAID AND I'LL WAIT NO YOU GO SAID ROBIN YOU KNOW THEM OH YES AND THEM WANT SOME MORE PIGS WANT ME TO BE LEATHERED AGAIN
THE LAST THAT ROBIN SAW OF HIS VELVET CAP AND PLUME WAS THAT ONE BLACK PIG TORE OUT THE FEATHER WHILE ANOTHER WAS CHAMPING THE VELVET IN HIS MOUTH IT WAS A BRAVE FIGHT BUT ALL IN VAIN AND A FEW MINUTES LATER THE BOY WAS STANDING TRIUMPHANTLY OVER POOR ROBIN
IN HIS ANGER AND SHAME ROBIN FELT THAT HE WANTED NO FOOD NOW ONLY TO GO AND HIDE HIMSELF AWAY AMONG THE TREES BUT HIS ENEMY'S NEXT WORDS HAD THEIR EFFECT YOU DIDN'T WANT THIS HERE HE SAID
AND HE MADE BELIEVE TO RUSH AT THEM WITH HIS BIG HOOK HANDLED STICK ROBIN WAS THROWN OFF HIS GUARD AND BEFORE HE WAS AWARE OF IT THE BOY MADE A SIDE LEAP AND DROPPING HIS STICK SEIZED HIM THREW HIM OVER ON HIS BACK AND SAT ASTRIDE UPON HIS CHEST
SHOW ME WHERE TO GET SOMETHING AND I'LL GIVE YOU MY CAP AND FEATHER I WANTS THE JACKET TOO SAID THE BOY I TELL YOU I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT CRIED ROBIN THEN I MEANS TO TAKE IT ROBIN SHRANK AWAY AND THE BOY TURNED UPON HIM FIERCELY
IT WAS STARTLING TOO WHEN FROM CLOSE AT HAND SOMEONE SEEMED TO BEGIN QUESTIONING HIM STRANGELY BY CALLING OUT WHOO WHO WHO WHO BUT AT THE END OF A MINUTE OR TWO HE KNEW IT WAS AN OWL
WITH THE RESULT THAT YOUNG ROBIN MADE A DASH AT HIM AND TRIED VAINLY TO CLIMB UP AND CLAP HIS HAND OVER THE GREAT FELLOW'S LIPS DON'T DON'T TELL CRIED THE BOY RAN AT ME ONLY YESTERDAY CRIED LITTLE JOHN AND BEGAN TO THRASH ME IN A PASSION
BUT SIR I HAVE COME HUMBLY TO YOU NOW
DOTTED WITH BEAUTIFUL GREAT OAK TREES AND NEARLY COVERED WITH THE BROAD LEAVES OF THE BRACKEN WHICH WERE AGITATED BY SOMETHING PASSING THROUGH AND BENEATH GIVING FORTH A GRUNTING SOUND
WHILE THE PIGS ROAMED HERE AND THERE NUZZLING THE FALLEN ACORNS OUT FROM THE BRACKEN AND CRUNCHING THEM UP LOUDLY ROBIN WANTED TO RUN
CRIED THE BOY SHARPLY AS HE STARED HARD AT THE STRANGE VISITOR TO THE FOREST
YOU GO FIRST WHAT AND MASTER COME P'RAPS AND FIND ME GONE LIKELY HE'D GIVE ME THE STRAP AGAIN THERE GET ON ROBIN WINCED
HERE LITTLE NAMESAKE SPEAK OUT AND LET YOUR FATHER KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN A GOOD BOY EVER SINCE YOU CAME HERE TO STAY YOUNG ROBIN WAS SILENT AND LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER IN A CURIOUSLY ABASHED FASHION WELL BOY WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK CRIED ROBIN HOOD MERRILY
I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL TO A MAN HERE HAVE LOVED HIM HALF SO WELL BUT COME
I CAN SHOOT WITH BOW AND ARROW NOW AND SOUND MY HORN HARK THE BOY CLAPPED HIS HORN TO HIS LIPS AND BLEW A FEW CHEERY NOTES WHICH RAN ECHOING DOWN THE FOREST GLADES AND THE MEN ASSEMBLED GAVE A HEARTY CHEER
ROBIN HOOD'S MEN THEN WERE SCATTERED ABOUT UNDER THE SHADE OF A HUGE SPREADING OAK TREE WAITING FOR THE ROAST VENISON WHICH SENT A VERY PLEASANT ODOR FROM THE GLOWING FIRE OF OAK WOOD
FOR AS ONE OLD HISTORY SAYS ROBIN HOOD WAS FORGIVEN AND RESTORED BY THE KING TO HIS RIGHTFUL POSSESSIONS AND THEN IT WAS THAT HE WAS GLADLY WELCOMED BY THE SHERIFF WHO SAID HE WAS HONORED BY THE VISIT OF THE NOBLEMAN AND HIS LADY
THEY WERE STILL ROBIN HOOD AND MAID MARIAN TO HIM
PRISONERS SAID YOUNG ROBIN POOR MEN TOO GRUMBLED LITTLE JOHN THEN YOU'LL GIVE THEM THEIR SUPPER AND SEND THEM AWAY TO MORROW MORNING SAID YOUNG ROBIN I SUPPOSE SO SAID LITTLE JOHN
AND THEN HE COULD SEE NOTHING THINK NOTHING THEN HE COULD THINK THOUGH HE STILL COULD NOT SEE FOR IT WAS VERY DARK AND SILENT AND STRANGE
MY PRISONER IF YOU HAD COME AMONGST US WITH YOUR POSSE OF ARMED MEN SIR SAID ROBIN HOOD PROUDLY AS IT IS MASTER SHERIFF YOU COME HERE ALONE WITH YOUR GUIDE AND I BID YOU WELCOME TO OUR GREENWOOD HOME
DO YOU FIND HIM CHANGED BIGGER AND STRONGER SAID THE SHERIFF DRAWING THE BOY CLOSER TO HIM WHILE THE LITTLE FELLOW CLUNG TO HIS HAND OUR WOODLAND LIFE AND I WARRANT YOU MASTER SHERIFF THAT HE IS NONE THE WORSE
DON'T TELL TALES OUT OF SCHOOL LITTLE JOHN CRIED ROBIN HOOD LAUGHING THERE ROB YOU MUST FORGIVE HIM WE'RE NONE OF US PERFECT MASTER SHERIFF AND IF YOUR LITTLE FELLOW HAD BEEN QUITE SO
I WANT MASTER SHERIFF TO HEAR THAT WE HAVE NOT SPOILED YOU COME TELL HIM YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD BOY HAVEN'T YOU YOUNG ROBIN HUNG HIS HEAD NO HE SAID SLOWLY
AND AS THEY DREW NEAR THE BOY SAW THAT ONE WAS A HOMELY POOR LOOKING MAN WITH ROUND SHOULDERS THE OTHER WELL DRESSED IN SAD COLORED CLOTHES AND THIN AND BENT BUT THE BOY COULD SEE LITTLE MORE FOR THE BROAD BANDAGE
SQUIRREL SAID ROBIN ALOUD AND THE ANIMAL HEARD AND SAW HIM AT THE SAME MOMENT SHOWING ITS ANNOYANCE AT THE PRESENCE OF AN INTRUDER DIRECTLY FOR IT BEGAN TO SWITCH ITS TAIL AND SCOLD AFTER ITS FASHION LOUDLY
WITH THE GAY JERKIN ROLLED UP UNDER HIS ARM AND THE LITTLE FELLOW STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET IN HIS TRUNK HOSE AND WHITE LINEN SHIRT HOT ANGRY AND TORN AND WISHING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THAT HE WERE AS BIG AND STRONG AS THE TYRANT WHO HAD MASTERED HIM
AND ALL AT THE SAME TIME FOR HIS STRONGEST DESIRE JUST THEN WAS TO FIGHT HIS TYRANT AND FOR SOME MINUTES NEITHER SPOKE AT LAST THE BIG BOY SAID IN A LOW GROWLING WAY NOW THEN ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME THEM THINGS
AND THIS IS MAID MARIAN WHO HAS BEEN SO GOOD TO ME THE SHERIFF BOWED SLOWLY AND GRAVELY AS IF TO THE GREATEST LADY IN THE LAND AND THEN THE BOY DRAGGED AT HIS FATHER'S HAND
WITH HIS BROW WRINKLED UP HIS HEAD HANGING AND ONE FOOT SCRAPING SOFTLY AT THE MOSSY GRASS NO NOT ALWAYS LITTLE JOHN BURST INTO A TREMENDOUS ROAR OF LAUGHTER AND BEGAN TO STAMP ABOUT
THERE WERE TWO GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS AS HE CAUGHT THE BOY IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HIM AND SO IT WAS THAT WHEN YOUNG ROBIN RAN TO BID MAID MARIAN GOOD BYE HE COULD NO LONGER HOLD IT BACK
LITTLE JOHN WAS THERE LYING DOWN SMILING AND CONTENTED AFTER A HARD DAY'S HUNTING LISTENING TO YOUNG ROBIN WHO WAS DISPLAYING THE TREASURES HE HAD BROUGHT IN THAT DAY AND TELLING HIS GREAT COMPANION WHERE HE HAD FOUND THEM
WONDERFULLY LIKE THAT OF A DOG THIS WAS TAKEN UP DIRECTLY BY THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DROVE WHO WITH A GREAT DEAL OF BARKING AND GRUNTING CAME ON TO THE ATTACK FOR THEY DID NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THREATENING THEIR LIFE IN THE FOREST MAKING THEM FIERCE ENOUGH TO BE DANGEROUS
ROBIN CATCHING AT THEM EAGERLY PUTTING ONE BETWEEN HIS WHITE TEETH AND BITING IT BUT ONLY TO MAKE A FACE FULL OF DISGUST IT'S BITTER HE SAID IT'S NOT GOOD TO EAT
KICKING FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT ANOTHER BANGING THEM WITH A LONG HOOKED STICK HE HELD AND MAKING THEM RUN SQUEALING IN ALL DIRECTIONS
IT IS NOT NICE TO BE PITCHED BY A MAN OFF A HORSE'S BACK ON TO THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD
AS HE CLASPED HIS ARMS ABOUT HER NECK AND KISSED HER PASSIONATELY AGAIN AND AGAIN THE SOBS CAME FAST BUT THE WORD GOOD BYE WOULD NOT COME AT ALL AND WHEN THEY RODE AWAY THE BOY DARED NOT LOOK BACK FOR FEAR THE MEN SHOULD SEE HIS RED AND SWOLLEN EYES
FOR HALF A DOZEN OF THE MERRY MEN IN GREEN CAME MARCHING TOWARDS THEM WITH A COUPLE OF PRISONERS EACH HAVING HIS HANDS FASTENED BEHIND HIM WITH A BOW STRING AND A BROAD BANDAGE TIED OVER HIS EYES SO THAT THEY SHOULD NOT KNOW THEIR WAY AGAIN TO THE OUTLAWS STRONGHOLD
I WON'T GIVE THEM TO YOU I CAN'T I MUSTN'T CRIED ROBIN PASSIONATELY THE BOY SAID NOTHING BUT LOOKED AWAY AT HIS PIGS TWO OF WHICH WERE FIGHTING AH WOULD YOU HE CRIED
AND ALL WERE GATHERED TOGETHER TO BID HIM FAREWELL AND SEE HIM SAFELY WITH HIS FATHER ON THE ROAD BUT NOT AS THE SHERIFF HAD COME WEARILY AND ON FOOT FOR HALF A DOZEN OF THE BEST MULES WERE FORTHCOMING AND THE GUESTS WERE TO RIDE BACK ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME
BUT WHEN THE TIME CAME HE HAD TO LEARN HOW TIGHTLY SO MANY OF HIS LITTLE HEARTSTRINGS HAD TAKEN HOLD OF THE LIFE UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM HAD GROWN DEAR AND THERE WAS ALMOST A MULE LOAD OF TREASURES AND PETS OF HIS OWN COLLECTING THAT COULD NOT BE LEFT BEHIND
YOUNG ROBIN'S ARMS WERE TIGHTLY ROUND HIS FATHER'S NECK BY THIS TIME AND HE WAS KISSING THE CARE WORN FACE AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE FATHER THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE CRIED THE BOY PASSIONATELY
CHAPTER EIGHT THE SUN WAS LOW DOWN IN THE WEST AND SHINING THROUGH AND UNDER THE GREAT OAK AND BEECH TREES SO THAT EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE TURNED TO ORANGE AND GOLD IT WAS THE OUTLAWS SUPPER TIME
FATE MADE ME WHAT I AM THE SHERIFF'S ENEMY BUT THE GENTLE VISITOR'S FRIEND COME ROB MY BOY SHOW YOUR FATHER WHERE HE CAN TAKE AWAY THE TRAVEL STAINS AND THEN BRING HIM TO OUR HUMBLE BOARD
AND SOON AFTER HE WAS FAST ASLEEP AND DID NOT THINK AGAIN TILL THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND HE SAT UP WAITING FOR OLD DAVID TO COME AND PULL HIM UP ON THE HORSE AGAIN ROBIN WAITED FOR HE WAS AFRAID TO MOVE
AND WHEN THEY HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PACKED IN PANNIERS BY LITTLE JOHN AND ONE OF THE MEN THERE WAS THE TASK OF BIDDING THEM ALL GOOD BYE AND THEN THOSE TWO WORDS GREW HARDER EVERY TIME BUT HE SPOKE OUT MANFULLY AND WELL IN SPITE OF A CHOKING SENSATION TILL NEARLY THE LAST
I THANK YOU SIR SAID THE SHERIFF SLOWLY I CAN GIVE YOU NOTHING BUT THANKS FOR AFTER A YEAR OF SORROW I FIND MY CHILD IS AFTER ALL ALIVE AND WELL AND I HOPE NOT WORSE THAN WHEN ACCIDENT BROUGHT HIM INTO OUR HANDS WHAT DO YOU SAY
AND MANY MOMENTS HAD NOT ELAPSED BEFORE THE PRISONER'S HANDS WERE FREE AND AS IF SEEING NO ONE BUT THE LITTLE FORESTER BEFORE HIM IN GREEN AND QUITE REGARDLESS OF ALL AROUND HE DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES CLASPED THE BOY TO HIS BREAST AND SOFTLY WHISPERED THE WORDS THANK GOD
AND A STRIP OF COW SKIN FOR A BELT TO HOLD IT IN I COULD SHOW YOU WHERE TO GET SOMETHING HE SAID AT LAST WELL SHOW ME CRIED ROBIN
ROBIN'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO RUN AWAY BUT HE KNEW THAT FOUR LEGS ARE BETTER THAN TWO FOR GETTING OVER THE GROUND AND FELT THAT THE DROVE WOULD ATTACK HIM MORE FIERCELY IF THEY SAW THAT HE WAS AFRAID
WHAT WAS THAT IT WAS A PECULIAR SOUND MADE UP IN THE AIR BY LITTLE JOHN AND THAT DID IT FOR WHEN YOUNG ROBIN LOOKED UP IN ASTONISHMENT IT WAS TO SEE THE GREAT FELLOW'S FACE ALL PUCKERED UP AND YES
WHILE ROBIN HOOD CAME OUT TO SEE WHAT THE SIGNAL MEANT YOUNG ROBIN WHO WAS NOW QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORESTERS WAYS CAUGHT UP HIS BOW LIKE THE REST AND STOOD LOOKING EAGERLY IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE CHEERY SOUNDING NOTES OF THE HORN WERE BLOWN HE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT
THERE WERE FLOWERS FOR MAID MARIAN BECAUSE SHE WAS FOND OF THE PURPLE AND YELLOW LOOSESTRIFE AND LONG THICK REEDS IN A BUNDLE YOU CAN MAKE ME SOME ARROWS OF THOSE SAID ROBIN AND I'VE FOUND A YOUNG YEW TREE WITH A BOUGH QUITE STRAIGHT
YOU MUST CUT THAT DOWN AND DRY IT TO MAKE ME A BIGGER BOW THIS ONE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH VERY WELL BIG ONE SAID LITTLE JOHN SMILING AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO SMOOTH THE BOY'S CURLY BROWN HAIR ANYTHING ELSE FOR ME TO DO OH YES LOTS OF THINGS
WAITING TO BE FETCHED THE ROBIN CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN AS IF WONDERING THAT HE DID NOT PULL UP FLOWERS BY THE ROOTS AND DIG SO THAT WORMS AND GRUBS MIGHT BE FOUND AND FINALLY FLITTED AWAY THEN ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS THE PATTERING OF FEET
ITS UTTERANCES SEEMING LIKE A REPETITION OF THE WORD CHOP MORE OR LESS QUICKLY MADE FINDING ITS SCOLDING TO BE IN VAIN AND THAT THE BOY WOULD NOT GO THE SQUIRREL DID THE NEXT BEST THING BOUNDED ALONG FROM BOUGH TO BOUGH WHILE AFTER WAITING WEARILY IN THE HOPE OF SEEING DAVID
AND ROBIN WAS THINKING HOW HUNGRY HE WAS WHEN SOMETHING DROPPED CLOSE TO HIM WITH A LOUD RAP AND LOOKING UP SHARPLY HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A LITTLE KEEN EYED BUSHY TAILED ANIMAL LOOKING DOWN FROM A GREAT BRANCH AS IF IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING IT HAD LET FALL
BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ENTIRELY ALONE THERE IN THE DENSE FOREST FOR THERE WAS ANOTHER YOUNG ROBIN WITH LARGE EYES AND A SPECKLED JACKET SITTING UPON A TWIG AND WATCHING HIM INTENTLY
AND COMPLETED HIS GREAT FOLLOWER'S CONFUSION
AS IF ASKING HIS FATHER'S PARDON FOR THE OUTRAGE COMMITTED UPON HIM NO ROB SAID THE SHERIFF IN A CHOKING VOICE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS BUT YOU KNOW YOUR POOR OLD FATHER AGAIN
THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE ROBIN STOOD HOT EXCITED AND PANTING THE HERD BOY THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON HIS CHEST RESTED HIS CHIN UPON HIS HANDS AS HE STARED FIERCELY AT ROBIN AND KICKED HIS FEET UP AND DOWN
HE FELT HOT AND HIS HANDS CLENCHED AS HE LONGED TO STRIKE OUT AT HIS TYRANT BUT THE YOUNG SWINEHERD WAS BIG AND STRONG
THE CONSTANT HARSH SHOUTING IRRITATED THE LITTLE FELLOW SO THAT HE HURRIED AWAY FOLLOWED BY QUITE A BURST OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE MOCKING CRIES WITH THE INTENTION OF FINDING THE TRACK LEADING ACROSS THE FOREST BUT HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE FOUND HIMSELF IN AN OPEN GLADE
SO HE ONLY WAVED HIS HAT AND KEPT WAVING IT TO THE LAST BUT HE WAS TO SEE SOME OF HIS FRIENDS AGAIN FOR ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM HAD THE STRANGEST VISITORS OF HIS LIFE TIME AT HIS HOUSE AND YOUNG ROBIN ENJOYED THE TASK OF WELCOMING THEM
THE BOWED DOWN GRAY HAIRED PRISONER ROSE ERECT AT THIS AND CRIED IS THAT ROBIN HOOD WHO SPEAKS BEFORE THE OUTLAW COULD ANSWER HE WAS STOPPED BY A CRY FROM THE BOY
WHERE CAN I GET SOME THE BOY SHOOK HIS HEAD WHERE DO YOU LIVE ASKED ROBIN ALONG O MASTER WHERE'S THAT THE BOY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND STARED AT THE CAP AND FEATHER ONE OF HIS HANDS OPENING AND SHUTTING WILL YOU SHOW ME THE WAY HOME THEN
SO HE OBEYED HIS THIRD NOTION WHICH WAS TO JUMP TO WHERE A BIG PIECE OF DEAD WOOD LAY PICK IT UP AND HIT THE FOREMOST PIG ACROSS THE NOSE WITH IT THAT BLOW DID WONDERS IT MADE THE BLACK PIG WHICH RECEIVED IT UTTER A DISMAL SQUEAL
NO SAID ROBIN THROUGH HIS SET TEETH AND AGAIN THERE WAS SILENCE YOU GIVE EM TO ME AND I'LL SHOW YOU THE WAY TO WHERE THEY LIVE AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU ROAST DEER AND ROAST PIG P'RAPS FOR TWO OF OURN'S GONE
HIS HEAD ACHED THOUGH AND IT SEEMED NICE TO REST IT
THE BOY SHOOK HIS HEAD AGAIN
WHICH NEARLY COVERED THE PRISONER'S FACE AND WAS TIED TIGHTLY BEHIND OVER HIS LONG GRAY HAIR WHILE HIS GRAY BEARD HUNG DOWN LOW YOUNG ROBIN LOOKED PITYINGLY AT THIS PRISONER AND A LONGING CAME OVER HIM TO LOOSEN THE THONG WHICH TIED HIS HANDS TIGHTLY BEHIND HIM
AND CATCHING HIS FATHER'S HAND TO LEAD HIM TOWARDS WHERE ROBIN HOOD AND MARIAN WERE STANDING WET EYED LOOKING ON THIS IS MY FATHER CRIED THE BOY PROUDLY THIS IS ROBIN HOOD THE CAPTAIN FATHER HE CONTINUED AND THE SHERIFF BOWED GRAVELY
AND YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF MY PET FAWN FOR ME LITTLE JOHN AND ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FEED IT WELL AND DON'T FORGET THE DOG AND THAT DORMOUSE WE COULDN'T FIND SO THAT I CAN HAVE IT WHEN I COME BACK AND CROAK
BY THE NOISY PARTY OF JAYS THAT HAD BEEN DISTURBED IN THEIR HAPPY SOLITUDE TO ROBIN IT WAS JUST AS IF THE FIRST ONE HAD CRIED HOI I SAY HERE'S A BOY AND WEARY WITH WAITING AND HUNGRY AS HE WAS
BUT JUST THEN ROBIN HOOD CRIED
I TOLD YER I WOULD SAID THE YOUNG RUFFIAN WITH A GRIN YOU SHOULD HA GIVEN EM TO ME AT FIRST
AND NOW IT WAS PERFECTLY QUIET AND IT SEEMED RESTFUL AFTER BEING SHAKEN AND JERKED ABOUT ON THE HORSE'S BACK ROBIN WAS TIRED TOO AND THE DULL HALF STUPEFIED STATE OF HIS BRAIN STOPPED HIM FROM BEING STARTLED BY HIS STRANGE POSITION
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE OUR FELLOWS BRING THEM IN LET'S GO AND SEE SAID YOUNG ROBIN LITTLE JOHN FOLLOWED AS THE BOY MARCHED OFF BOW IN HAND TO WHERE ROBIN HOOD WAS STANDING WAITING TO HEAR WHAT HIS MEN HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE PRISONERS THEY HAD BROUGHT IN
AND THEN THE PIGS GET THEM SAID ROBIN THEN YOU MUST GET UP BEFORE THE PIGS AND BE FIRST HALLOA WHAT NOW FOR A HORN WAS BLOWN AT A DISTANCE AND THE MEN UNDER THE GREAT OAK TREE SPRANG TO THEIR FEET
IF I BEGIN TO WANDER ABOUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF DAVID WILL NOT FIND ME AND HE WILL GO HOME AND TELL FATHER I'M LOST WHEN ALL THE TIME HE THREW ME OFF THE HORSE BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID AND WANTED TO SAVE HIMSELF SO THE BOY SAT STILL
AND ITS COMPANIONS STOP AND STAND BARKING AND SNAPPING ALL AROUND HIM BUT THE BLOW BROKE THE PIECE OF DEAD WOOD IN TWO AND THE FIERCE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE COMING ON AGAIN WHEN A VOICE CRIED HI YOU KNOCKING OUR TIGS ABOUT
NO GOOD AT ALL CONTINUED THE GREAT FORESTER BUT I'LL SHOW YOU A TREE WHICH BEARS GOOD ONES
YOU'RE WELCOME TO THE WOODLANDS MASTER SHERIFF SAID ROBIN HOOD ADVANCING NOW WITH EXTENDED HAND DO NOT TAKE THIS AS THE OUTLAW'S HAND NOR EXTEND YOURS AS THE SHERIFF BUT LET IT BE THE GRASP OF TWO ENGLISHMEN ONE OF WHOM RECEIVES A GUEST
SAID LITTLE JOHN BUT THEY'RE NO GOOD LOOK HE TORE ONE OF THE HUSKS OPEN AND LAID BARE THE RICH BROWN NUT BUT IT WAS AS HE SAID GOOD FOR NOTHING THERE BEING NO HARD SWEET KERNEL WITHIN NOTHING BUT SOFT PITHY WOOLLY STUFF
YOU'RE GOING TO EAT PART AND BRING SOME TO ME SO'S I CAN HELP EAT THE REST YOU BRING A LOT MIND CAUSE I CAN EAT EVER SO MUCH NOW THEN GO ON
THE SUN BEING THEIR CLOCK IN THE FOREST AND THE MEN WERE GATHERING TOGETHER TO ENJOY THEIR SECOND GREAT MEAL OF THE DAY THE OTHER BEING BREAKFAST AFTER HAVING WHICH THEY ALWAYS SEPARATED TO GO HUNTING THROUGH THE WOODS TO BRING IN THE PROVISIONS FOR THE NEXT DAY
AND HALF A DOZEN DEER CAME INTO SIGHT WITH SOFT DAPPLED COATS AND ONE OF THEM WITH LARGE FLAT POINTED HORNS BUT AT THE FIRST MOVEMENT ROBIN MADE THEY DASHED OFF AMONG THE TREES IN A SERIES OF BOUNDS THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER LONG PAUSE
NONE OF THAT HE CRIED SEE THIS HERE STICK IF YOU WAS TO TRY TO RUN AWAY I SHOULD SEND IT SPINNING AFTER YOU AND IT WOULD BREAK YOUR LEGS AND KNOCK YOU DOWN AND I COULD SEND THE TIGS AFTER YOU AND THEY'D SOON BRING YOU BACK ROBIN DREW A DEEP BREATH
AND FOR SOME MINUTES HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE WAS OUT THERE ON THE MOSS INSTEAD OF BEING IN AUNT HESTER'S HOUSE AT ELTON OR AT HOME IN NOTTINGHAM TOWN BUT HE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL AT ONCE RECOLLECTING WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
GIVE YOU MY CLOTHES SAID ROBIN WONDERINGLY I CAN'T DO THAT THEN I SHALL TAKE EM SAID THE BOY IN A HUSKY GROWL I'M SO HUNGRY CRIED ROBIN
YES YES MY BOY A LONG LONG YEAR OF MISERY AND SORROW BUT I HAVE FOUND YOU NOW AT LAST OH I AM GLAD CRIED THE BOY STRUGGLING FREE
AND FINISHED BY SAYING I'M SO HUNGRY AND I WANT TO GO HOME WHERE CAN I GET SOME BREAKFAST DUNNO SAID THE BOY HAVE SOME OF THESE HE TOOK A HANDFUL OF ACORNS FROM A DIRTY SATCHEL AND HELD THEM OUT
BETTER NOR I HAVE THERE GO STRAIGHT ON THERE AND I'LL SHOW YER D'YER HEAR I DON'T WANT TO GO NOW SAID ROBIN FIERCELY OH DON'T YER THEN I DO YOU'RE AGOING AFORE I MAKES YER AND WHEN THEY'VE GIVE YER A LOT
AND HE WALES ME WITH A STRAP BECAUSE I LET THEM TAKE THE PIGS AND NEXT TIME HE COUNTS EM THERE'S MORE THAN THERE WAS BEFORE BUT HE'S WHIPPED ME ALL THE SAME
AS HE REACHED UP TO TEAR THE BANDAGE FROM THE FACE BENDING OVER HIM AND THEN DARTED ROUND TO BEGIN SAWING AT THE THONG WHICH HELD HIS FATHER'S HANDS LITTLE JOHN TOOK A STEP OR TWO FORWARD TO HELP THE BOY BUT ROBIN HOOD HELD UP HIS HAND TO KEEP HIM BACK
WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO SAY GOOD BYE YOUNG ROBIN DID NOT TILL THE TIME HAD COME HE AWOKE THAT MORNING JOYFUL AND EAGER TO START FOR IT WAS TO GO BACK HOME IN COMPANY WITH THE FATHER WHOM HE LOVED
THE PLAY WENT ON SHYLOCK APPEARED I FORGOT EVERY THING BUT HIM SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF LATENT MALICE AND REVENGE OF EVERY THING DETESTABLE IN HUMAN NATURE
PRESENTLY EVEN THAT SOUND DIED OUT AND THE WHOLE OF THE FISHERMAN'S REST SEEMED WRAPT IN SLEEP SAVE THE TWO YOUNG MEN DRINKING IN SILENCE BESIDE THE HEARTH FOR A WHILE NO SOUND WAS HEARD EVEN IN THE COFFEE ROOM SAVE THE TICKING OF THE OLD GRANDFATHER'S CLOCK AND THE CRACKLING OF THE BURNING WOOD
AND THOUGH HE HAD WRITTEN A TREATISE ON FLUXIONS AND A WORK ON BOTANY YET HE WAS NOT A MERE MATHEMATICIAN
WHEN HE PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN THAT THIS PERSON WITH WHOM HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO MAKE ME ACQUAINTED WAS A LEARNED RABBI WHO AT THIS TIME TAUGHT HEBREW TO SEVERAL OF THE GOWNSMEN OF CAMBRIDGE
AND THE VICOMTE LAY CONCEALED AMONG THE TURNIPS AND CABBAGES THEY THEMSELVES OF COURSE NEVER SUSPECTED WHO THEIR DRIVER WAS HE DROVE THEM RIGHT THROUGH A LINE OF SOLDIERY AND A YELLING MOB WHO WERE SCREAMING A BAS LES ARISTOS
I THOUGHT I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE AND PRESENTED MY PACKET WITH SOME HESITATION READING ALOUD THE DIRECTION TO MISTER ISRAEL LYONS I AM THE MAN SIR SAID HE OUR HONEST FRIEND JACOB HAS DESCRIBED YOU SO WELL MISTER HARRINGTON MISTER WILLIAM HARRINGTON HARRINGTON
TO MARK THE EFFECT OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN CHANGING MY OWN PREPOSSESSIONS THE FAULTS OF ISRAEL LYONS WERE NOT OF THAT SPECIES WHICH I EXPECTED TO FIND IN A JEW PERHAPS HE WAS AWARE THAT THE HEBREW NATION IS IN GENERAL SUPPOSED TO BE TOO CAREFUL
I SLEEP AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE MYSELF BUT IF YOUR LORDSHIP'LL ONLY CALL LOUDLY ENOUGH I DARESAY I SHALL HEAR ALL RIGHT JELLY AND I SAY PUT THE LAMP OUT THE FIRE'LL GIVE US ALL THE LIGHT WE NEED AND WE DON'T WANT TO ATTRACT THE PASSER BY
SO INTENT WERE THEY UPON THIS SO WRAPT UP IN THE CAUSE THE BUSINESS THEY HAD SO MUCH AT HEART SO PRECIOUS WAS THIS DOCUMENT WHICH CAME FROM THE VERY HAND OF THEIR ADORED LEADER THAT THEY HAD EYES AND EARS ONLY FOR THAT THEY LOST COUNT OF THE SOUNDS AROUND THEM
THIS WAS PROMPTLY AND QUIETLY DONE THE MASKED MAN HAVING TAKEN POSSESSION OF ALL THE PAPERS LISTENED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO IF THERE WERE ANY SOUND WITHIN THE FISHERMAN'S REST EVIDENTLY SATISFIED THAT THIS DASTARDLY OUTRAGE HAD REMAINED UNHEARD
WHEN A TINY SLIP OF PAPER FLUTTERED FROM IT AND FELL ON TO THE FLOOR LORD ANTONY STOOPED AND PICKED IT UP WHAT'S THAT HE ASKED I DON'T KNOW REPLIED SIR ANDREW IT DROPPED OUT OF YOUR POCKET JUST NOW IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT SEEM TO BE WITH THE OTHER PAPER
THE AWKWARD BUSTLE THEY MADE FACING AND BACKING PLACING AND CHANGING OF PLACES AND THE DIFFICULTY THEY FOUND IN SEATING THEMSELVES WERE IN STRIKING CONTRAST WITH THE HIGH BRED EASE OF THE LADIES OF OUR PARTY
NO FRIEND YOU NEED NOT ASK REPLIED SIR ANDREW GAILY IT WAS ALL RIGHT THEN HERE'S TO HER VERY GOOD HEALTH SAID JOVIAL LORD TONY SHE'S A BONNIE LASS THOUGH SHE IS A FRENCH ONE AND HERE'S TO YOUR COURTSHIP MAY IT FLOURISH AND PROSPER EXCEEDINGLY
LADY ANNE MOWBRAY LOOKED DOWN UPON THEIR OPERATIONS WITH A PRETTY AIR OF QUIET SURPRISE TINCTURED WITH HORROR WHILE MY MOTHER'S SHRINKING DELICACY ENDEAVOURED TO SUGGEST SOME IDEA OF PROPRIETY TO THE CITY MATRON
WERE JUST SUFFICIENTLY FRESH AND RESTIVE TO ADD ZEST TO THE EXPEDITION AND MARGUERITE REVELLED IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FEW HOURS OF SOLITUDE WITH THE SOFT NIGHT BREEZE FANNING HER CHEEKS HER THOUGHTS WANDERING WHITHER AWAY
SIMULTANEOUSLY THE CROUCHING SNAKE LIKE FIGURE IN THE GLOOM HAD JUMPED UP AND HURLED ITSELF FROM BEHIND UPON THE UNSUSPECTING SIR ANDREW FELLING HIM TO THE GROUND
OF THE DROPPING OF THE CRISP ASH FROM THE GRATE OF THE MONOTONOUS TICKING OF THE CLOCK OF THE SOFT ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE RUSTLE OF SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR CLOSE BESIDE THEM A FIGURE HAD EMERGED FROM UNDER ONE OF THE BENCHES
JACOB LEFT WITH ME A LETTER FOR HIM AND THE VERY PARCEL WHICH I HAD SEEN DIRECTED TO MISTER ISRAEL LYONS THESE I ENGAGED TO DELIVER WITH MY OWN HANDS JACOB DEPARTED SATISFIED HAPPY IN THE HOPE THAT HE HAD DONE ME A SERVICE AND SO IN FACT IT PROVED
MISTER ISRAEL LYONS IS NOW NO MORE I HOPE IT IS NO DISRESPECT TO HIS MEMORY TO SAY THAT HE HAD HIS FOIBLES IT WAS NO SECRET AMONG OUR CONTEMPORARIES AT CAMBRIDGE THAT HE WAS LIKE TOO MANY OTHER MEN OF GENIUS A LITTLE DEFICIENT IN ECONOMY SHALL I SAY IT
I AM SURE SIR SHE REPLIED MISTER ALDERMAN COATES AND MYSELF WILL BE PARTICULARLY GLAD OF THE HONOUR OF SEEING YOU TOMORROW OR ANY TIME AND MOREOVER SIR THE YOUNG LADY ADDED SHE WITH A SHREWD AND TO ME OFFENSIVE SMILE
AND THE CONTRAST WAS STRIKING BETWEEN WHAT HE CONCEIVED MY FIRST OBJECTS AT CAMBRIDGE WOULD BE AND WHAT THEY REALLY WERE HOWEVER I THANKED HIM FOR HIS GOOD OPINION AND PROMISED TO MAKE MYSELF ACQUAINTED WITH HIS LEARNED COUNTRYMAN
MY IMAGINATION FORMED SUCH A STRONG CONCEPTION OF THE PAIN THE JEWESS WAS FEELING AND MY INVERTED SYMPATHY IF I MAY SO CALL IT SO OVERPOWERED MY DIRECT AND NATURAL FEELINGS THAT AT EVERY FRESH DEVELOPMENT OF THE JEW'S VILLANY I SHRUNK AS THOUGH I HAD MYSELF BEEN A JEW
THANKING ME AGAIN FOR TAKING AS HE SAID SUCH A KIND INTEREST IN THE CONCERNS OF A POOR JEW LIKE HIM HE ADDED WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES THAT HE WISHED HE MIGHT SOME TIME SEE ME AGAIN THAT HE SHOULD TO THE LAST DAY OF HIS LIFE REMEMBER ME AND SHOULD PRAY FOR MY HEALTH AND HAPPINESS
I SEE HOW IT IS I SEE HOW IT WILL BE THESE THINGS ARE RULED IN HEAVEN ABOVE OR HELL BENEATH TIS IN VAIN STRUGGLING WITH ONE'S DESTINY SO YOU TO YOUR JEWESS AND I TO MY LITTLE JESSICA WE SHALL HAVE HER AGAIN I HOPE IN THE FARCE THE PRETTIEST CREATURE I EVER SAW
AND THEY SHOULD GIVE IN ITS STEAD THE MERCHANT OF VENICE THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AND MACKLIN THE JEW MURMURS OF DISCONTENT FROM THE LADIES IN MY BOX WHO REGRETTED THEIR SENTIMENTAL COMEDY AND THEIR SILVER TONED BARRY WERE ALL LOST UPON ME
HAVE YOU ANY SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ME YES RATHER MORE PRECISE ONES THAN USUAL IT APPEARS THAT THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT HAVE SENT AN ACCREDITED AGENT OVER TO ENGLAND A MAN NAMED CHAUVELIN
AND TO OFFER HIM MY GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS IN THE COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION I MENTIONED THE CHILDISH TERROR AND AVERSION WITH WHICH I HAD BEEN EARLY TAUGHT TO LOOK UPON A JEW I REJOICED THAT EVEN WHILE A SCHOOLBOY I HAD CONQUERED THIS FOOLISH PREJUDICE
HE MADE HIS WAY TO A YOUNG LADY AT THE OTHER END OF THE BOX AND I OCCUPYING IMMEDIATELY THE CEDED PLACE STATIONED MYSELF SO THAT I HAD A BETTER VIEW OF MY OBJECT AND COULD OBSERVE HER WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY ANY ONE SHE WAS PERFECTLY STILL
IN THE COFFEE ROOM THE MASKED LEADER OF THIS DARING ATTEMPT WAS QUICKLY GLANCING THROUGH THE STOLEN PAPERS
CHAPTER NINE THE OUTRAGE A BEAUTIFUL STARLIT NIGHT HAD FOLLOWED ON THE DAY OF INCESSANT RAIN A COOL BALMY LATE SUMMER'S NIGHT ESSENTIALLY ENGLISH IN ITS SUGGESTION OF MOISTURE AND SCENT OF WET EARTH AND DRIPPING LEAVES
THIS LASTED TILL WE REACHED HER BOX AND THEN SHE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY TO ALL THE MISS ISSYS CECYS AND HENNYS THAT IT WAS WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY I COULD EVEN BY CAREFULLY WATCHING MY MOMENT OBTAIN A CARD WITH HER OWN AND ANOTHER WITH MISS MONTENERO'S ADDRESS
I FOUND HIM IN THE MIDST OF HIS HEBREW SCHOLARS AND MOREOVER WITH SOME OF THE BEST MATHEMATICIANS AND SOME OF THE FIRST LITERARY MEN IN CAMBRIDGE
IN SPITE OF HER HURRY AND HER INCESSANT TALKING I NAMED THE THING I WAS INTENT UPON I SAID THAT WITH HER PERMISSION I SHOULD DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF CALLING UPON HER THE NEXT MORNING TO INQUIRE AFTER MISS BERRY'S HEALTH
AND SOME PASSAGES STRUCK ME IN QUITE A NEW LIGHT ON THE JEWISH SIDE OF THE QUESTION MANY A TIME AND OFT IN THE RIALTO YOU HAVE RATED ME ABOUT MY MONEYS AND MY USANCES STILL HAVE I BORNE IT WITH A PATIENT SHRUG
ALL EXCEPT THE BOY ON DUTY IN THE BAR AND ADDED MISTER JELLYBAND WITH A LAUGH I EXPECT HE'LL BE ASLEEP AFORE LONG THE RASCAL THEN WE CAN TALK HERE UNDISTURBED FOR HALF AN HOUR AT YOUR SERVICE MY LORD I'LL LEAVE YOUR CANDLES ON THE DRESSER AND YOUR ROOMS ARE QUITE READY
SHE LOOKED UP WHILE MY EYES WERE FIXED UPON HER A SUDDEN AND DEEP COLOUR SPREAD OVER HER FACE AND MOUNTED TO HER TEMPLES IN MY CONFUSION I DID THE VERY THING I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE AND SAID THE THING OF ALL OTHERS I SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID
IN THE SAME MANNER AFTER A JEW HAD ONCE MADE AN IMPRESSION ON MY IMAGINATION A JEW APPEARED WHEREVER I WENT AS I WAS ON MY ROAD TO CAMBRIDGE TRAVELLING IN A STAGECOACH WHILST WE WERE SLOWLY GOING UP A STEEP HILL
THOUGH FROM AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION IN THE AIR OF THE BACK OF HER HEAD AND NECK
EVERY FATHER AND EVERY SON WHO HAS BEEN AT THE UNIVERSITY KNOWS HOW MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE COLLEGE COMPANIONS WITH WHOM A YOUNG MAN FIRST ASSOCIATES THERE ARE USUALLY TWO SETS IF HE SHOULD JOIN THE DISSIPATED SET IT IS ALL OVER WITH HIM HE LEARNS NOTHING
AND SPEAK WITHOUT AN INTRODUCTION EXCUSE ME IF I SUGGEST AGAINST THE NEXT ACT THAT THIS YOUNG LADY HAS NEVER BEEN AT A PLAY BEFORE IN HER LIFE IN LON'ON AT LEAST
HE WORE A MASK AND NOW STOOD MOTIONLESS WHILE THE OTHERS COMPLETED THEIR WORK ALL SAFE CITOYEN SAID ONE OF THE MEN AS HE TOOK A FINAL SURVEY OF THE BONDS WHICH SECURED THE TWO YOUNG MEN GOOD REPLIED THE MAN AT THE DOOR NOW SEARCH THEIR POCKETS AND GIVE ME ALL THE PAPERS YOU FIND
YET SINCE SHE IS HERE TIS BETTER SHE SHOULD SEE SOMETHING THAN NOTHING IF GENTLEMEN WILL GIVE HER LEAVE I BOWED IN SIGN OF SUBMISSION AND REPENTANCE AND WAS RETIRING SO AS TO LEAVE MY PLACE VACANT AND A FULL OPENING TO THE STAGE
DOCTOR JOHNSON IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS SPEAKING OF A FIRST VISIT FROM A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED TO HIS ACQUAINTANCE SAYS THAT THE INITIATORY CONVERSATION OF TWO STRANGERS IS SELDOM PLEASING OR INSTRUCTIVE
IF I WOULD CONTINUE TO STAND AS I HAD DONE I OBEYED AND PLACED MYSELF SO AS TO SCREEN HER FROM OBSERVATION DURING THE WHOLE OF THE NEXT ACT BUT NOW MY PLEASURE IN THE PLAY WAS OVER I COULD NO LONGER ENJOY MACKLIN'S INCOMPARABLE ACTING
IN EVERY CONVERSATION THAT WE HEAR IN EVERY BOOK WE OPEN IN EVERY NEWSPAPER WE TAKE UP THE REIGNING IDEA RECURS AND THEN WE ARE SURPRISED AND EXCLAIM AT THESE WONDERFUL COINCIDENCES
BUT IN A SWEET GENTLEWOMANLIKE VOICE SEEMING PERHAPS MORE DELIGHTFUL FROM CONTRAST THE YOUNG LADY SAID THAT SHE HAD SEEN AND COULD SEE QUITE AS MUCH AS SHE WISHED OF THE PLAY AND SHE BEGGED THAT I WOULD NOT QUIT MY PLACE I SHOULD OBLIGE HER SHE ADDED IN A LOWER TONE
WITH SNAKE LIKE NOISELESS MOVEMENTS IT CREPT CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE TWO YOUNG MEN NOT BREATHING ONLY GLIDING ALONG THE FLOOR IN THE INKY BLACKNESS OF THE ROOM YOU ARE TO READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND COMMIT THEM TO MEMORY SAID SIR ANDREW THEN DESTROY THEM
HE DRAINED HIS GLASS TO THE LAST DROP THEN JOINED HIS FRIEND BESIDE THE HEARTH WELL YOU'LL BE DOING THE JOURNEY NEXT TONY I EXPECT SAID SIR ANDREW ROUSING HIMSELF FROM HIS MEDITATIONS YOU AND HASTINGS CERTAINLY
I EAGERLY OFFERED MY SERVICES WHICH WERE ACCEPTED AND WE CONDUCTED THE YOUNG LADY OUT SHE DID NOT FAINT SHE STRUGGLED AGAINST IT AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THERE WAS NO AFFECTATION IN THE CASE BUT ON THE CONTRARY AN ANXIOUS DESIRE NOT TO GIVE TROUBLE
OR WHICH SHOULD VACATE HER SEAT IN HER FAVOUR IN SPITE OF THE AWKWARDNESS OF HER SITUATION SHE STOOD WITH SUCH QUIET RESIGNED YET DIGNIFIED GRACE THAT RIDICULE COULD NOT TOUCH HER THE MOMENT SHE WAS SEATED WITH HER BACK TO US AND OUT OF HEARING
IN DESPITE OF THE ASSERTION THAT HEBREW ROOTS ARE ALWAYS FOUND TO FLOURISH BEST ON BARREN GROUND
WHOSE ESCAPE FROM HIS CHATEAU AFTER HE HAD BEEN DECLARED A SUSPECT BY THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY WAS A MASTERPIECE OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL'S INGENUITY
I WISH BEFORE I TAKE LEAVE OF YOU TO TELL YOU SIR WHO MY FATHER WAS WAS FOR HE IS NO MORE I DID NOT MAKE A MYSTERY OF HIS NAME MERELY TO EXCITE CURIOSITY AS SOME OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN THOUGHT NOR BECAUSE I WAS ASHAMED OF MY LOW BIRTH
WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE PASSAGE BEYOND WHAT'S THAT SAID BOTH INSTINCTIVELY LORD ANTONY CROSSED THE ROOM TOWARDS THE DOOR WHICH HE THREW OPEN QUICKLY AND SUDDENLY AT THAT VERY MOMENT HE RECEIVED A STUNNING BLOW BETWEEN THE EYES WHICH THREW HIM BACK VIOLENTLY INTO THE ROOM
AND THAT HE WAS SORRY HE HAD NO WAY OF SHOWING ME HIS GRATITUDE AGAIN HE RECURRED TO HIS BOX AND WOULD OPEN IT TO SHOW ME THE TRANSLATION OF MENDELSSOHN'S LIFE OR IF THAT DID NOT INTEREST ME HE BEGGED OF ME TO TAKE MY CHOICE FROM AMONG A FEW BOOKS HE HAD WITH HIM
I LEANED FAR OVER TOWARDS THE STAGE THAT I MIGHT NOT LOSE A WORD A LOOK A GESTURE WHEN THE ACT FINISHED AS THE CURTAIN FELL AND THE THUNDERS OF APPLAUSE DIED AWAY I HEARD A SOFT LOW SIGH NEAR ME I LOOKED AND SAW THE JEWESS
AS RICH AS A JEW SHE'LL BE MISS MONTENERO MISS MONTENERO REPEATED LORD MOWBRAY AND I IN THE SAME INSTANT I THOUGHT SAID I THIS YOUNG LADY'S NAME WAS BERRY BERRY YES BERRY WE CALL HER WE WHO ARE INTIMATE
FROM THE PERCEPTION THAT MY ANTICIPATIONS WERE JUST AND THAT I PERFECTLY KNEW HOW TO READ HER SOUL AND INTERPRET HER COUNTENANCE I SAW THAT THE STRUGGLE TO REPRESS HER EMOTION WAS OFTEN THE UTMOST SHE COULD ENDURE AND AT LAST I SAW OR FANCIED I SAW
THIS VISIT DETERMINED MY COURSE AND DECIDED ME AS TO THE SOCIETY WHICH I KEPT DURING THE THREE HAPPY AND PROFITABLE YEARS I AFTERWARDS SPENT AT CAMBRIDGE
EACH EXCLAMATION AGAINST THIS DOG OF A JEW AND STILL MORE EVERY GENERAL REFLECTION ON JEWISH USURY AVARICE AND CRUELTY I FELT POIGNANTLY NO POWER OF IMAGINATION COULD MAKE ME PITY SHYLOCK BUT I FELT THE FORCE OF SOME OF HIS APPEALS TO JUSTICE
YOU PERCEIVE THAT I AM WELL INFORMED THAT I FEEL AS IF I HAD HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING ACQUAINTED WITH YOU FOR SOME TIME
THAT SHE GREW SO PALE THAT AS SHE CLOSED HER EYES AT THE SAME INSTANT I WAS CERTAIN SHE WAS GOING TO FAINT AND QUITE FORGETTING THAT I WAS AN UTTER STRANGER TO HER I STARTED FORWARD AND THEN UNPROVIDED WITH AN APOLOGY COULD ONLY TURN TO MISSUS COATES
I REJOICED THAT I SHOULD SEE MACKLIN IN SHYLOCK BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE BEGAN MY ATTENTION WAS AGAIN CAUGHT BY THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE PERSONS IN THE NEXT BOX THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME SUDDEN CAUSE OF DISTRESS AS I GATHERED FROM EXCLAMATIONS OF HOW UNLUCKY HOW DISTRESSING
MUCH AS MY EXPECTATIONS HAD BEEN RAISED IT FAR SURPASSED ANY THING I HAD CONCEIVED I FORGOT IT WAS MACKLIN I THOUGHT ONLY OF SHYLOCK IN MY ENTHUSIASM I STOOD UP I PRESSED FORWARD
IF WE ARE LIKE YOU IN THE REST WE WILL RESEMBLE YOU IN THAT IF A JEW WRONG A CHRISTIAN WHAT IS HIS HUMILITY REVENGE IF A CHRISTIAN WRONG A JEW WHAT SHOULD HIS SUFFERANCE BE BY CHRISTIAN EXAMPLE WHY REVENGE
MISSUS COATES ALL THANKS AND APOLOGIES AND HURRY NOW LITERALLY ELBOWED HER WAY BACK TO HER BOX EXPRESSING HER REITERATED FEARS THAT WE SHOULD LOSE THE BEST PART OF THE MAID OF THE OAKS WHICH WAS THE ONLY FARCE SHE MADE IT A RULE EVER TO STAY FOR
THE IMPATIENT STICKS IN THE PIT AND SHRILL CATCALLS IN THE GALLERY HAD BEGUN TO CONTEND WITH THE MUSIC IN THE ORCHESTRA AND THRICE HAD WE SURVEYED THE HOUSE TO RECOGNIZE EVERY BODY WHOM ANY BODY KNEW WHEN THE DOOR OF THE BOX NEXT TO OURS THE ONLY BOX THAT HAD REMAINED EMPTY
IN A LITERARY MANUFACTORY WHEN I WENT TO DELIVER MY PACKET TO MISTER LYONS I WAS SURPRISED BY SEEING IN HIM A MAN AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM MY PRECONCEIVED NOTION OF A JEWISH RABBI I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GUESSED HIM TO BE EITHER A RABBI OR A JEW
WHICH HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO LEND ME WE HAD NOW REACHED THE COACH AT THE TOP OF THE HILL I GOT IN AND SAW JACOB TRUDGING AFTER ME FOR SOME TIME BUT AT THE FIRST TURN OF THE ROAD I LOST SIGHT OF HIM AND THEN AS MY TWO COMPANIONS IN THE COACH WERE NOT VERY ENTERTAINING
I WAS NEVER FOND OF MONEY OR REMARKABLY CAREFUL OF IT MYSELF BUT I ALWAYS KEPT OUT OF DEBT AND MY FATHER GAVE ME SUCH A LIBERAL ALLOWANCE THAT I HAD IT IN MY POWER TO ASSIST A FRIEND
JELLYBAND WENT OFF TO FETCH THE WINE THE ROOM NOW WAS QUITE DARK SAVE FOR THE CIRCLE OF RUDDY AND FITFUL LIGHT FORMED BY THE BRIGHTLY BLAZING LOGS IN THE HEARTH IS THAT ALL GENTLEMEN ASKED JELLYBAND AS HE RETURNED WITH A BOTTLE OF WINE AND A COUPLE OF GLASSES WHICH HE PLACED ON THE TABLE
SHE KNEW FROM OLD EXPERIENCE THAT SIR PERCY WOULD SPEAK LITTLE IF AT ALL HE HAD OFTEN DRIVEN HER ON HIS BEAUTIFUL COACH FOR HOURS AT NIGHT FROM POINT TO POINT WITHOUT MAKING MORE THAN ONE OR TWO CASUAL REMARKS UPON THE WEATHER OR THE STATE OF THE ROADS
I EXPRESSED A FEAR THAT I HAD BEEN STANDING IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PREVENT HER FROM SEEING SHYLOCK SHE BOWED MILDLY AND WAS I BELIEVE GOING TO SPEAK YOU HAVE INDEED SIR INTERRUPTED MISSUS COATES STOOD SO THAT NOBODY COULD SEE NOTHING BUT YOURSELF SO SINCE YOU MENTION IT
I FELT AT ONCE HORROR OF THE INDIVIDUAL SHYLOCK AND SUBMISSION TO THE STRENGTH OF HIS APPEAL DURING THE THIRD ACT DURING THE JESSICA SCENES I LONGED SO MUCH TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE JEWESS THAT I TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF CHANGING MY POSITION
MISSUS ABINGDON PLAYS LADY BAB LARDOON HER FAVOURITE CHARACTER SHE IS INCOMPARABLE AND I WOULD NOT MISS IT FOR THE WORLD I BEGGED MOWBRAY TO GO BACK FOR I COULD NOT LEAVE THESE LADIES WELL SAID HE PARTING FROM ME AND PURSUING HIS OWN WAY
HE SAID THAT IF I HAD ANY CURIOSITY ABOUT IT HE COULD LEND ME A TRANSLATION WHICH HE HAD IN HIS PACK AND WITH ALL THE ALACRITY OF GOOD WILL HE SET DOWN THE BOX TO LOOK FOR THE BOOK NO DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF DON'T OPEN IT SAID I PUTTING MY HAND ON THE BOX
ALL BLUSHING AND RELUCTANT FORCED BY THE IRRESISTIBLE FAT ORDERER OF ALL THINGS TO STEP UP ON THE SEAT TO STEP FORWARD FROM BENCH TO BENCH AND THEN WAIT IN PAINFUL PRE EMINENCE WHILE ISSY AND CECY AND QUEENEY AND MISS COATES SETTLED HOW THEY COULD MAKE ROOM
THE UNION OF MANY MINDS INTENT UPON THE SAME OBJECT
THE REST OF THE ROOM LAY BURIED IN COMPLETE GLOOM SIR ANDREW HAD TAKEN A POCKET BOOK FROM HIS POCKET AND DRAWN THEREFROM A PAPER WHICH HE UNFOLDED AND TOGETHER THEY TRIED TO READ IT BY THE DIM RED FIRELIGHT
A LITTLE EXTRAVAGANT THE DIFFICULTIES INTO WHICH HE BROUGHT HIMSELF BY HIS IMPROVIDENCE WERE HOWEVER ALWAYS TO HIM MATTERS OF JEST AND RAILLERY AND OFTEN INDEED PROVED SUBJECTS OF TRIUMPH FOR HE WAS SURE TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF BY SOME OF HIS MANY TALENTS
THEN SUDDENLY STARTING AND STRETCHING FORWARD TO THE FRONT ROW WHERE FIVE OF HER YOUNG LADIES WERE WEDGED SHE AIMED WITH HER FAN AT EACH OF THEIR BACKS IN QUICK SUCCESSION
NO I HAVEN'T INTERRUPTED HIS FRIEND PLEASANTLY BUT I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT AND NOW HE ADDED WHILST A SUDDEN EARNESTNESS CREPT OVER HIS JOVIAL YOUNG FACE HOW ABOUT BUSINESS THE TWO YOUNG MEN DREW THEIR CHAIRS CLOSER TOGETHER AND INSTINCTIVELY THOUGH THEY WERE ALONE THEIR VOICES SANK TO A WHISPER
MISS BERRY DID HER UTMOST TO SUPPORT HERSELF AND SAID SHE BELIEVED SHE WAS NOW QUITE WELL AND COULD RETURN BUT I SAW SHE WISHED TO GET AWAY AND I RAN TO SEE IF A CHAIR COULD BE HAD
WHEN THE LEARNED SIR THOMAS BROWNE WAS WRITING HIS ESSAY ON THE GARDENS OF CYRUS HIS IMAGINATION WAS SO POSSESSED BY THE IDEA OF A QUINCUNX THAT HE IS SAID TO HAVE SEEN A QUINCUNX IN EVERY OBJECT IN NATURE
DIGRESSED INTO A SUBJECT UTTERLY UNINTERESTING TO ME AND WOULD EXPLAIN TO US THE REASONS WHY MISTER ALDERMAN COATES AND MISTER PETER COATES HER SON WERE NOT THIS NIGHT OF HER PARTY
IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS EARLY INTENSE AND MISAPPLIED APPLICATION IN HIS FIRST JEWISH SCHOOL HE WAS SEIZED AT TEN YEARS OLD WITH SOME DREADFUL NERVOUS DISEASE THIS INTERESTED ME AND I WENT ON WITH HIS HISTORY OF HIS LIFE I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE REMEMBERED NOTHING
AND DURING THE SUCCEEDING ACTS MY ATTENTION WAS CHIEFLY DIRECTED TO THE STUDY OF ALL THE CHANGES IN HER EXPRESSIVE COUNTENANCE I NOW SAW AND HEARD THE PLAY SOLELY WITH REFERENCE TO HER FEELINGS I ANTICIPATED EVERY STROKE WHICH COULD TOUCH HER
THAT MISTER HARRINGTON WILL NOT HATE POOR JACOB THOUGH HE IS THE SON OF HE PAUSED I ASSURED HIM OF MY REGARD I ASSURED HIM THAT I HAD LONG SINCE GOT RID OF ALL THE FOOLISH PREJUDICES OF MY CHILDHOOD
BUT I AM SURE THAT I WAS BOTH PLEASED AND INSTRUCTED DURING THIS INITIATORY CONVERSATION AND MISTER LYONS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE OPPRESSED OR ENCUMBERED BY MY VISIT I FOUND BY HIS CONVERSATION
HE ACQUIRES KNOWLEDGE AND A TASTE FOR KNOWLEDGE WITH ALL THE ARDOUR INSPIRED BY SYMPATHY AND EMULATION WITH ALL THE FACILITY AFFORDED BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND PUBLIC LECTURES THE COLLECTED AND COMBINED INFORMATION OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD HE PURSUES HIS STUDIES
MISTER LYONS LIVELY DISPOSITION AND MANNERS TOOK OFF ALL THAT AWE WHICH I MIGHT HAVE FELT FOR HIS LEARNING AND GENIUS I MAY TRULY SAY THAT THESE THREE YEARS WHICH I SPENT AT CAMBRIDGE FIXED MY CHARACTER AND THE WHOLE TONE AND COLOUR OF MY FUTURE LIFE
THERE WAS A PEDLAR'S BOX BESIDE HIM I THOUGHT I KNEW THE BOX I CALLED OUT AS WE WERE PASSING AND ASKED THE MAN WHAT'S THE MILE STONE HE LOOKED UP IT WAS POOR JACOB
WHICH IS HER OUT O THE WAY CHRISTIAN THAT IS JEWISH NAME MISTER MONTENERO THE FATHER IS A SPANISH OR AMERICAN JEW I'M NOT CLEAR WHICH BUT HE'S A CHARMING MAN FOR A JEW AND THE DAUGHTER MOST UNCOMMON FOND OF HIM TO A DEGREE
HE WANTS YOU AND HASTINGS TO MEET HIM AT CALAIS SAID SIR ANDREW MORE QUIETLY ON THE SECOND OF NEXT MONTH LET ME SEE THAT WILL BE NEXT WEDNESDAY YES IT IS OF COURSE THE CASE OF THE COMTE DE TOURNAY THIS TIME A DANGEROUS TASK FOR THE COMTE
CAN'T NOW BEAR ANY REFLECTIONS THE MOST DISTANT NOW SIR UPON THE JEWS WHICH WAS WHAT DISTRESSED ME WHEN I FOUND THE PLAY WAS TO BE THIS JEW OF VENICE
MARGUERITE HAD HAILED THE NOTION OF IT WITH DELIGHT
JACOB WAS GOING OUT TO GIBRALTAR IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT WEEK AND NOW MISTER HARRINGTON SAID HE CHANGING HIS TONE AND SPEAKING WITH EFFORT AS IF HE WERE CONQUERING SOME INWARD FEELING NOW IT IS ALL OVER MISTER HARRINGTON AND THAT I AM LEAVING ENGLAND AND PERHAPS MAY NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN
HE SAID HE WAS GOING INTO ANOTHER AND A MUCH BETTER WAY OF BUSINESS HIS FRIEND THE LONDON JEWELLER HAD RECOMMENDED HIM TO HIS BROTHER A RICH ISRAELITE WHO HAD A VALUABLE STORE IN GIBRALTAR AND WHO WANTED A YOUNG MAN TO ASSIST HIM ON WHOM HE COULD ENTIRELY DEPEND
SIR ANDREW HAD BEEN DREAMING EVIDENTLY GAZING INTO THE FIRE AND SEEING THEREIN NO DOUBT A PRETTY PIQUANT FACE WITH LARGE BROWN EYES AND A WEALTH OF DARK CURLS ROUND A CHILDISH FOREHEAD YES HE SAID STILL MUSING ALL RIGHT
WARMED AND COOLED BY THE SAME WINTER AND SUMMER AS A CHRISTIAN IS IF YOU PRICK US DO WE NOT BLEED IF YOU TICKLE US DO WE NOT LAUGH IF YOU POISON US DO NOT WE DIE AND IF YOU WRONG US SHALL WE NOT REVENGE
LEANING ON THE PARTITION WHICH DIVIDED OR OUGHT TO HAVE DIVIDED HER FROM US CONSIDERABLY PASSED THE LINE OF DEMARCATION LADY DE BRANTEFIELD WITH ALL THE PRIDE OF ALL THE DE BRANTEFIELDS SINCE THE NORMAN CONQUEST CONCENTRATED IN HER COUNTENANCE
AND WITHOUT RESTING HER GLASS UPON THEM FOR HALF A MOMENT TURNED IT TO SOME MORE PROFITABLE FIELD OF SPECULATION THERE WAS NO GENTLEMAN OF THIS PARTY BUT A PORTLY MATRON TOWERING ABOVE THE REST SEEMED THE PRINCIPAL MOVER AND ORDERER OF THE GROUP
SHOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT HIS LOSSES THWARTED HIS BARGAINS COOLED HIS FRIENDS HEATED HIS ENEMIES SHYLOCK DESERVED ALL THIS BUT WHEN HE CAME TO WHAT'S HIS REASON I AM A JEW
THAT'LL DO NICELY THANKS JELLY SAID LORD TONY GOOD NIGHT MY LORD GOOD NIGHT SIR GOOD NIGHT JELLY THE TWO YOUNG MEN LISTENED WHILST THE HEAVY TREAD OF MISTER JELLYBAND WAS HEARD ECHOING ALONG THE PASSAGE AND STAIRCASE
WAS THROWN OPEN AND IN POURED AN OVER DRESSED PARTY WHOM NOBODY KNEW LADY DE BRANTEFIELD AFTER ONE RECONNOITRING GLANCE PRONOUNCED THEM TO BE CITY GOTHS AND VANDALS
MY FATHER WAS SIMON THE OLD CLOTHES MAN
STRANGE I WONDER WHEN IT GOT THERE IT IS FROM THE CHIEF HE ADDED GLANCING AT THE PAPER BOTH STOOPED TO TRY AND DECIPHER THIS LAST TINY SCRAP OF PAPER ON WHICH A FEW WORDS HAD BEEN HASTILY SCRAWLED WHEN SUDDENLY A SLIGHT NOISE ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION
HE THANKED ME AND TOLD ME THAT HE WAS MUCH BETTER IN THE WORLD THAN FORMERLY THAT A GOOD FRIEND OF HIS A LONDON JEWELLER OF HIS OWN TRIBE WHO HAD EMPLOYED HIM AS A PEDLAR AND HAD BEEN SATISFIED WITH HIS CONDUCT HAD ASSISTED HIM THROUGH HIS DIFFICULTIES
AND UNTIL THE CHIEF HAS SAMPLED THE LOT HE THINKS WE SHOULD MEET AS SELDOM AS POSSIBLE ON THE BUSINESS OF THE LEAGUE AND ON NO ACCOUNT SHOULD TALK TO EACH OTHER IN PUBLIC PLACES FOR A TIME WHEN HE WANTS TO SPEAK TO US HE WILL CONTRIVE TO LET US KNOW
PROBABLY SUCH HAPPEN EVERY DAY BUT PASS UNOBSERVED WHEN THE MIND IS NOT INTENT UPON SIMILAR IDEAS OR EXCITED BY ANY STRONG ANALOGOUS FEELING
SAINT JUST HAS ACTUALLY GONE TO MEET HIM OF COURSE NO ONE SUSPECTS SAINT JUST AS YET BUT AFTER THAT TO GET THEM BOTH OUT OF THE COUNTRY I'FAITH TWILL BE A TOUGH JOB AND TAX EVEN THE INGENUITY OF OUR CHIEF I HOPE I MAY YET HAVE ORDERS TO BE OF THE PARTY
HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO BURN MERRILY I SAY JELLY HAS EVERYONE GONE ASKED LORD TONY AS THE WORTHY LANDLORD STILL BUSIED HIMSELF CLEARING AWAY GLASSES AND MUGS EVERYONE AS YOU SEE MY LORD AND ALL YOUR SERVANTS GONE TO BED
MENDELSSOHN WAS A JEW BORN LIKE HIMSELF IN ABJECT POVERTY BUT BY PERSEVERANCE HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH INCREDIBLE DIFFICULTIES TO THE HIGHEST LITERARY REPUTATION AMONG THE MOST EMINENT MEN OF HIS COUNTRY AND OF HIS AGE AND OBTAINED THE NAME OF THE JEWISH SOCRATES
ALL EYES TURNED TO LOOK FOR BERRY
THREW AN EXCOMMUNICATING WITHERING LOOK UPON THE ARM BUT THE ELBOW FELT IT NOT IT NEVER STIRRED THE LADY SEEMED NOT TO BE MADE OF PENETRABLE STUFF IN HAPPY IGNORANCE SHE SAT FANNING HERSELF FOR A FEW SECONDS
BUT TO OUR SURPRISE WE BEHELD ONE WHO SEEMED OF A DIFFERENT ORDER OF BEINGS FROM THOSE BY WHOM SHE WAS SURROUNDED LORD MOWBRAY AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER STRUCK BY THE SAME SENTIMENT PAINED FOR THIS ELEGANT TIMID YOUNG CREATURE AS WE SAW HER
EXCEPT WHAT RELATED TO THE NERVOUS DISORDER BUT IT SO HAPPENED THAT SOON AFTER I HAD READ THIS LIFE I HAD OCCASION TO SPEAK OF IT AND IT WAS OF CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE IN INTRODUCING ME TO GOOD COMPANY AT CAMBRIDGE A FEW DAYS AFTER I ARRIVED THERE JACOB CALLED ON ME
AT EVERY STROKE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SKILFUL ACTOR OR OF THE MASTER POET I FELT A STRANGE MIXTURE OF ADMIRATION AND REGRET I ALMOST WISHED THAT SHAKSPEARE HAD NOT WRITTEN OR MACKLIN HAD NOT ACTED THE PART SO POWERFULLY
LORD MOWBRAY WHO HAD ASSISTED IN CONDUCTING THE LADIES OUT NOW FOLLOWED ME HE SAW AND CALLED TO ONE OF HIS FOOTMEN AND DESPATCHED HIM FOR A CHAIR THERE NOW SAID MOWBRAY WE MAY LEAVE THE REST TO MISSUS COATES WHO CAN ELBOW HER OWN WAY THROUGH IT COME BACK WITH ME
MISSUS COATES ALARMED IMMEDIATELY WISHED THEY COULD GET HER OUT INTO THE AIR AND REGRETTED THAT HER GENTLEMEN WERE NOT WITH THEIR PARTY TO NIGHT THERE COULD BE NO GETTING SERVANTS OR CARRIAGE WHAT COULD BE DONE
HE SAID HE SHOULD BE THERE IN A FEW DAYS FOR THAT HE TOOK CAMBRIDGE IN HIS ROAD AND HE REJOICED THAT HE SHOULD SEE ME AGAIN I GAVE HIM A DIRECTION TO MY COLLEGE AND FOR HIS GRATIFICATION IN TRUTH MORE THAN FOR MY OWN I BORROWED THE MAGAZINE CONTAINING THE LIFE OF MENDELSSOHN
TO MAKE THE MATTER SECURE AS JACOB WAS TO LEAVE CAMBRIDGE THE NEXT DAY
AND WHO IF I MAY BE BOLD ENOUGH TO SAY SO HAS BEEN PREPOSSESSED IN YOUR FAVOUR BY HEARING OF YOUR HUMANITY TO POOR JACOB TOUCHED AS I WAS BY HIS EAGERNESS TO BE OF USE TO ME I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT JACOB'S SIMPLICITY AND ENTHUSIASM
THE LADIES IN OUR BOX WERE NOW SO HAPPILY OCCUPIED WITH SOME YOUNG OFFICERS OF THE GUARDS THAT THERE WAS NO FARTHER DANGER OF THEIR STARING AT THE JEWESS I WAS SO PLACED THAT I COULD SEE HER WITHOUT BEING SEEN
ADMIRING THE DEXTEROUS CERTAIN WAY IN WHICH HE HANDLED THE REINS SHE OFTEN WONDERED WHAT WENT ON IN THAT SLOW GOING HEAD OF HIS HE NEVER TOLD HER AND SHE HAD NEVER CARED TO ASK AT THE FISHERMAN'S REST MISTER JELLYBAND WAS GOING THE ROUND PUTTING OUT THE LIGHTS
AND MY NECESSARY ENGAGEMENTS DO NOT LEAVE AS MUCH TIME FOR MY PLEASURES AS I COULD WISH I PERCEIVED BY THE TONE OF HIS ADDRESS THAT THOUGH HE WAS A HEBREW TEACHER HE WAS PROUD OF SHOWING HIMSELF TO BE A MAN OF THE WORLD
MISS BERRY THAT MUST NOT BE COME FORWARD HERE'S MY PLACE OR QUEENEY'S CRIED MISSUS COATES STRETCHING BACKWARDS WITH HER UTMOST MIGHT TO SEIZE SOME ONE IN THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE BACK ROW WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN INVISIBLE
NOTED THE TINY SCRAP OF PAPER WHICH THE TWO YOUNG MEN HAD ONLY JUST HAD TIME TO READ BUT ONE LETTER SPECIALLY SIGNED ARMAND SAINT JUST SEEMED TO GIVE HIM STRANGE SATISFACTION
LADY DE BRANTEFIELD TURNED TO HER SON AND ASKED WHO IS SHE AN EAST INDIAN I SHOULD GUESS BY HER DARK COMPLEXION WHISPERED LADY ANNE TO ME SOME FEATHER OR LAPPET INTERCEPTED MY VIEW OF HER FACE
HE ONCE MORE OPENED THE DOOR AND POINTED PEREMPTORILY DOWN THE PASSAGE THE FOUR MEN LIFTED SIR ANDREW AND LORD ANTONY FROM THE GROUND AND AS QUIETLY AS NOISELESSLY AS THEY HAD COME THEY BORE THE TWO PINIONED YOUNG GALLANTS OUT OF THE INN AND ALONG THE DOVER ROAD INTO THE GLOOM BEYOND
PUTTING HIS BOOK IN HIS POCKET TOOK UP HIS WELL KNOWN BOX AND WALKED ALONG WITH ME I BEGAN NOT BY ASKING ANY QUESTION ABOUT HIS FATHER THOUGH CURIOSITY WAS NOT QUITE DEAD WITHIN ME
WHICH RECALLED TO MY MIND THE LIFE OF THIS GREAT MAN BY THE HELP OF THAT I HAD HAPPILY SOME IDEAS IN COMMON WITH THE LEARNED JEW AND WE ENTERED IMMEDIATELY INTO CONVERSATION MUCH TO OUR MUTUAL RELIEF AND DELIGHT
HIS BAR CUSTOMERS HAD ALL GONE BUT UPSTAIRS IN THE SNUG LITTLE BEDROOMS MISTER JELLYBAND HAD QUITE A FEW IMPORTANT GUESTS THE COMTESSE DE TOURNAY WITH SUZANNNE AND THE VICOMTE
INSTANTLY A SMILE AND A SIGH AND A LOOK OF INEFFABLE KINDNESS AND GRATITUDE FROM JACOB SHOWED ME THAT ALL THE PAST RUSHED UPON HIS HEART NOT TROUBLE MYSELF OH MASTER HARRINGTON SAID HE POOR JACOB IS NOT SO UNGRATEFUL AS THAT WOULD COME TO
THEY WERE EACH SEIZED BY TWO MEN A MUFFLER WAS QUICKLY TIED ROUND THE MOUTH OF EACH AND THEY WERE PINIONED TO ONE ANOTHER BACK TO BACK THEIR ARMS HANDS AND LEGS SECURELY FASTENED ONE MAN HAD IN THE MEANWHILE QUIETLY SHUT THE DOOR
I KNEW ALL THAT YOU SUFFERED IN YOUR CHILDHOOD ABOUT HIM AND I ONCE HEARD YOU SAY TO LORD MOWBRAY WHO WAS TAUNTING YOU WITH SOMETHING ABOUT OLD SIMON THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THAT KNOWN UPON ANY ACCOUNT TO YOUR SCHOOL FELLOWS FOR THAT THEY WOULD PLAGUE YOU FOR EVER
THE MAGNIFICENT COACH DRAWN BY FOUR OF THE FINEST THOROUGHBREDS IN ENGLAND HAD DRIVEN OFF ALONG THE LONDON ROAD WITH SIR PERCY BLAKENEY ON THE BOX HOLDING THE REINS IN HIS SLENDER FEMININE HANDS AND BESIDE HIM LADY BLAKENEY WRAPPED IN COSTLY FURS
YOU'RE ONLY TOO GRATEFUL SAID I BUT WALK ON KEEP UP WITH ME AND TELL ME HOW YOUR AFFAIRS ARE GOING ON IN THE WORLD FOR I AM MUCH MORE INTERESTED ABOUT THEM THAN ABOUT THE LIFE OF THE CELEBRATED MENDELSSOHN IS THAT POSSIBLE SAID HIS LOOKS OF GENUINE SURPRISED SIMPLICITY
NO HITCH NONE LORD ANTONY LAUGHED PLEASANTLY AS HE POURED HIMSELF OUT ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE
WHO IS SAID TO BE TERRIBLY BITTER AGAINST OUR LEAGUE AND DETERMINED TO DISCOVER THE IDENTITY OF OUR LEADER SO THAT HE MAY HAVE HIM KIDNAPPED THE NEXT TIME HE ATTEMPTS TO SET FOOT IN FRANCE THIS CHAUVELIN HAS BROUGHT A WHOLE ARMY OF SPIES WITH HIM
HE PUT A PIECE OF BROKEN MIRROR INTO HIS TRAP AND A HOOPOE SPYING IT WENT IN TO ADMIRE HERSELF AND WAS CAUGHT THE FOWLER LOOKED AT THE SHINING CROWN UPON HER HEAD AND SAID WHAT HAVE WE HERE
OH IT'S TRUE GASPED PETER AS IF IT WERE AS HARD WORK TO BELIEVE HIS OWN EYES AS IT WAS TO BELIEVE SAMMY JAY
REMEMBER KING THAT ONE DAY YOU ALSO MUST GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOUR SINS LET ME NOT THEREFORE BE CONDEMNED UNHEARD AND IF I HEAR YOU WHAT EXCUSE CAN YOU HAVE TO OFFER ANSWERED SOLOMON FROWNING
AND SO PLEASANT IN THE WOODS WITH THE LITTLE FLIES BUZZING ABOUT THAT BEFORE HE KNEW IT UNCLE WIGGILY HAD FALLEN ASLEEP HIS PINK NOSE STOPPED TWINKLING
A TALENT WAS WORTH THREE HUNDRED SHEKELS
CHATTERER SAW SOMETHING VERY FAMILIAR BEHIND THE OLD STONE WALL AT THE EDGE OF THE OLD ORCHARD IT BOBBED UP AND THEN DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT AGAIN THEN IT BOBBED UP AGAIN ONLY TO DROP
IN FACT HE DIDN'T HALF HEAR THE MEAN THINGS REDDY FOX SAID TO HIM YOU SEE IT WAS COMING OVER HIM MORE AND MORE THAT NOTHING COULD TAKE THE PLACE OF FREEDOM HE HAD A COMFORTABLE HOME PLENTY TO EAT
THE CYNICAL OLD CROW CROAKED DISAGREEABLY THE FURTHER AWAY FROM MEN I AM THE BETTER I AM PLEASED LAST OF ALL THE COCK WHO SINGS IN THE MORNING CHANTED HIS JOYOUS SONG THINK OF YOUR CREATOR
THE HOOPOES FLYING PAST AND CALLING TO THEM FEEBLY HE BEGGED THEM TO SHELTER HIM FROM THE BURNING RAYS THE KING OF THE HOOPOES GATHERED TOGETHER HIS WHOLE NATION
AND WHEN SHE HAD READ THE BRIEF INVITATION SHE STARED AND STARED AGAIN BUT SHE HAD HEARD THE FAME OF SOLOMON AND WAS EAGER TO ASK HIM
BUT IF YOU HAVE NONE I'LL RUN HOME AND GET SOME MYSELF WILL YOU HOLD THE KITE WHILE I'M GONE TO BE SURE I WILL SAID UNCLE WIGGILY SO HE TOOK HOLD OF THE STRING OF TOMMIE'S KITE
HE HAD DISCOVERED A MEANS OF LOCOMOTION COMPARED TO WHICH THE MOST MAGNIFICENT RAILWAY COACHES AND THE RICHEST PALANQUINS OF INDIAN PRINCES WOULD SEEM POOR INDEED HE HAD CAUSED HIS GENII TO MAKE A SILKEN CARPET OF FOUR LEAGUES IN EXTENT
IN THIS WAY THE REMAINING HOOPOES WERE SAVED FOR WHEN THE FOWLERS SAW THAT THEY NO LONGER WORE CROWNS OF GOLD UPON THEIR HEADS THEY CEASED TO HUNT THEM AS THEY HAD BEEN DOING
A VERY LITTLE SPECK BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THE KITE
THE WISE KING WAS CHATTING PLEASANTLY WITH THE BIRDS WHO LIVED IN HIS WONDERFUL GARDEN AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH HE HEARD THEM SAY THE NIGHTINGALE THE SWEETEST SINGER OF ALL CHANTED
IN HEAVY WAGONS OR CLUMSY BOATS BY DUSTY ROADS OR STORMY WAVES IT WAS IN NO SUCH TROUBLOUS WAYS THAT SOLOMON THE ALL POWERFUL TRAVERSED SPACE AND REACHED THE UTTERMOST CORNERS OF THE EARTH THANKS TO HIS GREAT KNOWLEDGE
IT MADE CHATTERER ANGRY JUST TO SEE HIM SMARTY SMARTY MISTER SMARTY GLAD TO SEE YOU LOOKING HEARTY WEATHER'S FINE AS YOU CAN SEE WON'T YOU TAKE A WALK WITH ME SO SAID REDDY FOX
BE SURE TO TELL NO OTHER MAN OF THE MATTER A SHEKEL WAS ABOUT SIXTY TWO CENTS AFTER THIS THE FOWLER CAUGHT MANY HOOPOES IN THE SAME WAY AND SOLD THEIR CROWNS TO ISSACHAR
AND THEN HE KNEW IT WAS TOMMIE'S KITE FLYING UP IN THE AIR THAT WAS DOING THE PULLING THE WIND WAS BLOWING HARD NOW AND AS UNCLE WIGGILY HAD THE KITE STRING WOUND AROUND HIS PAWS
COLORED A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH GRAY WITH FEATHERS OF PURPLE BROWN AND WHITE AND HIS BLACK WINGS ARE BANDED WITH WHITE BUT THE PECULIAR THING ABOUT A HOOPOE IS HIS CROWN OF TAWNY FEATHERS A TALL CROWN FOR SO SMALL A BIRD
AND THEY DECIDED TO APPEAL ONCE MORE TO KING SOLOMON WHO HAD GRANTED THEIR FOOLISH PRAYER FLYING BY STEALTH THROUGH THE LONELIEST WAYS THE UNHAPPY KING OF THE HOOPOES CAME AT LAST TO THE COURT OF THE KING
CRIED UNCLE WIGGILY I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT BUT I'LL GO WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED OF ME HE ASKED TOMMIE KAT WHO WAS MAKING A FISHPOLE OF HIS TAIL BY STANDING IT STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR
THE EAGLE LED HIM TO THE KING WHO WITH A WRATHFUL FACE WAS SITTING ON HIS THRONE THE HOOPOE TREMBLED AND DROOPED HIS FEATHERS HUMBLY BUT WHEN SOLOMON WOULD HAVE CRUSHED HIM IN HIS MIGHTY FIST THE BIRD CRIED
FOR A WHOLE DAY THE HOOPOES TALKED THE MATTER OVER AMONG THEMSELVES THEN THEIR KING CAME TO SOLOMON AND SAID TO HIM WE HAVE CONSIDERED YOUR OFFER O GENEROUS KING
BUT THIS WAS HIS FAVORITE BIRD AND HE HOPED THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME REASON FOR SPARING HIM WELL SAID THE HOOPOE AT MECCA I MET A HOOPOE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO TOLD ME SO WONDERFUL A TALE OF THE MARVELOUS KINGDOM OF SHEBA
OFF TO MY DEN YOU SHALL GO YOU SHALL GO YOU SHALL GO OFF TO MY DEN OH HOLD ON CRIED THE BAD CREATURE THAT ISN'T THE SONG I WANTED TO SING THAT'S THE LONDON BRIDGE SONG
FROM THE SUN'S HEAT AS THE HOOPOES HAD FIRST DONE ONE DAY WHILE ON SUCH A JOURNEY
WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT YOU CAN GO UP TO FARMER BROWN'S HOUSE AND SEE HIM IN PRISON YOURSELF JUST AS I DID SO LATE THAT AFTERNOON WHEN ALL WAS QUIET AROUND THE FARMYARD
TAKE THIS LETTER TO QUEEN BALKIS THEN COME AWAY THE HOOPOE DID AS HE WAS BID DARTING OFF TOWARDS THE SOUTH LIKE AN ARROW AND THE NEXT DAY HE CAME TO THE PALACE OF THE QUEEN OF SHEBA WHERE SHE SAT
INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH AS IF IT WERE MADE OF TRANSPARENT GLASS AND DISCOVER THE PLACES WHERE SPRINGS OF LIVING WATER WERE HIDDEN UNDER THE SOIL IT WAS VERY CONVENIENT FOR SOLOMON WHEN HE WAS TRAVELING TO HAVE SOME ONE WITH HIM
AND THEN BECAUSE IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT AND HE REALLY DIDN'T DARE STAY ANOTHER MINUTE PETER WAVED GOOD BY TO CHATTERER AND STARTED FOR THE GREEN FOREST AS FAST AS HIS LONG LEGS COULD TAKE HIM
AND THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR
AND HIS EYES STUCK OUT OF HIS HEAD BUT HE SAID CARELESSLY IT IS A CROWN OF BRASS MY FRIEND I WILL GIVE YOU A QUARTER OF A SHEKEL FOR IT AND IF YOU FIND ANY MORE BRING THEM TO ME BUT
A LITTLE LATER WHO SHOULD APPEAR PEEPING OVER THE STONE WALL BUT REDDY FOX
BUT HE COULDN'T STOP VERY LONG TO MAKE FUN OF POOR CHATTERER IN THE FIRST PLACE FARMER BROWN'S BOY HAD PUT HIS HEAD OUT THE BARN DOOR TO SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT IN THE SECOND PLACE
IT SEEMED THAT SOON THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HOOPOES LEFT TO BEWAIL THEIR SAD FATE AT LAST THE FEW WHO STILL LIVED GATHERED TOGETHER AND HELD A MEETING TO CONSIDER WHAT SHOULD BE DONE FOR THEIR MINDS WERE FILLED WITH SORROW AND DISMAY
SOAR ALOFT COMMANDED SOLOMON STERNLY AND FIND THE HOOPOE THAT I MAY PUNISH HIM I WILL PLUCK OFF HIS FEATHERS THAT HE MAY FEEL THE SCORCHING HEAT OF THE SUN AS HIS CARELESSNESS HAS CAUSED ME TO DO THE EAGLE SOARED HEAVENWARD
KING SOLOMON LOOKED KINDLY UPON THE KING OF THE HOOPOES AND SAID BEHOLD DID I NOT WARN YOU OF YOUR FOLLY IN DESIRING TO HAVE CROWNS OF GOLD VANITY AND PRIDE HAVE BEEN YOUR RUIN
BUT ONE DAY AS HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE METALWORKER'S SHOP HE MET A JEWELER AND TO HIM HE SHOWED ONE OF THE HOOPOES CROWNS WHAT IS THIS AND WHERE DID YOU FIND IT EXCLAIMED THE JEWELER IT IS PURE GOLD
YOU SEE REDDY KNEW THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY
OUT OF SIGHT JUST AS QUICKLY IT LOOKS TO ME VERY MUCH AS IF PETER RABBIT IS OVER THERE AND FEELING VERY NERVOUS SAID CHATTERER TO HIMSELF AND THEN HE CALLED SHARPLY JUST AS WHEN
AND THIS IS THE STORY OF THE HOOPOE'S CROWN ONE DAY WHEN SOLOMON WAS JOURNEYING ACROSS THE DESERT HE WAS SORELY DISTRESSED BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN UNTIL HE CAME NEAR TO FAINTING JUST THEN HE SPIED A FLOCK OF HIS FRIENDS
THE BUNNY UNCLE AND THE LITTLE KITTEN BOY CUT OUT SOME RED PAPER IN THE SHAPE OF A KITE THEN THEY PASTED IT ON THE CROSSED STICKS WHICH WERE TIED TOGETHER WITH STRING THE KITE IS ALMOST DONE SAID UNCLE WIGGILY
WHICH OVERHUNG HIS HEAD SHADING HIS EYES THE KING GLANCED UP AND PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS AN OPENING IN THE CANOPY ONE BIRD WAS MISSING FROM ITS POST IN GREAT DISPLEASURE SOLOMON DEMANDED OF THE EAGLE THE NAME OF THE TRUANT
ANYTHING SPECIAL TO DO WHY NO I GUESS NOT ANSWERED THE BUNNY UNCLE I JUST HAVE TO GO WALKING TO LOOK FOR AN ADVENTURE TO HAPPEN TO ME AND THEN
HE HAS DISCOVERED YOUR ABSENCE AND IN HIS RIGHTEOUS ANGER WILL PUNISH YOU SEVERELY LEAD ME TO HIM REPLIED THE HOOPOE I KNOW THAT HE WILL FORGIVE ME WHEN HE HEARS WHERE I HAVE BEEN AND WHAT I HAVE TO TELL HIM
THE KITE CAN'T PULL THAT UP SO THE RABBIT GENTLEMAN FASTENED THE KITE CORD TO THE STOUT OLD STUMP WINDING IT AROUND TWO OR THREE TIMES AND HE KEPT THE LOOSE END OF THE STRING IN HIS PAW
SAID THE BUNNY UNCLE SADLY NO YOU WILL GO WITH ME CRIED THE BABBOON COME ALONG NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU AWAY WELL IF I MUST GO I SUPPOSE I MUST UNCLE WIGGILY SAID
THAT'S RIGHT FOR GUINEA PIGS HAVE NO TAILS YOU KNOW THOUGH IF YOU ASK ME WHY I CAN'T TELL YOU SOME KITES DO HAVE TAILS THOUGH AND OTHERS DO NOT
WHICH WAS NOW QUITE HIGH IN THE AIR AND SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND UNCLE WIGGILY HELD THE KITE FROM RUNNING AWAY WHILE TOMMIE WENT FOR MORE STRING IT WAS A NICE WARM SUMMER DAY
I WANT THE ONE ABOUT THE DINNER BELL IS RINGING IN THE BREAD BOX THIS FINE DAY AND THE DINNER BELL IS RINGING FOR TO TAKE YOU FAR AWAY UNCLE WIGGILY AH THEN I HAD BETTER GO TO MY DINNER
UNCLE WIGGILY HAVE YOU ANYTHING SPECIAL TO DO TODAY ASKED TOMMIE KAT THE LITTLE KITTEN BOY ONE MORNING AS HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR OF THE HOLLOW STUMP BUNGALOW WHERE MISTER LONGEARS THE RABBIT GENTLEMAN LIVED
OF COURSE HE WAS PULLED ALMOST OFF HIS FEET HA THAT KITE IS A GREAT PULLER SAID THE BUNNY UNCLE I MUST LOOK OUT OR IT MIGHT PULL ME UP TO THE CLOUDS I HAD BETTER FASTEN THE STRING TO THIS OLD STUMP
IN ARABIA THAT I COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO VISIT THAT COUNTRY OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES AND THERE INDEED I SAW THE MOST PRODIGIOUS TREASURES BUT BEST OF ALL O KING
UNTIL THE EARTH BENEATH HIM LOOKED LIKE A BOWL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
ANXIOUSLY THE EAGLE CALLED THE ROLL OF ALL THE BIRDS IN HIS COMPANY AND HE WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND THAT IT WAS SOLOMON'S FAVORITE THE HOOPOE WHO WAS MISSING WITH TERROR HE ANNOUNCED THE BIRD'S DESERTION TO THE MOST WISE KING
PAPER STICKS PASTE AND STRING WE'LL MAKE A BIG ONE AND FLY IT AWAY UP IN THE AIR
HE KNEW THAT THEY JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SMART MISTER CHATTERER HAD REALLY BEEN CAUGHT AND NO ONE DID BELIEVE IT ALL RIGHT SAMMY WOULD REPLY IT DOESN'T MAKE THE LEAST BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD TO ME
MORE GLORIOUS THAN GOLD MORE PRECIOUS THAN RARE JEWELS I SAW QUEEN BALKIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF QUEENS TELL ME OF THIS QUEEN SAID SOLOMON LOOSENING HIS ROUGH GRASP UPON THE HOOPOE
IN ALL HER SPLENDOR AMONG HER COUNSELORS HE HOPPED INTO THE HALL AND DROPPED THE LETTER INTO HER LAP THEN FLEW AWAY QUEEN BALKIS STARED AND STARED AT THE GREAT KING'S SEAL UPON THE MYSTERIOUS LETTER
UNCLE WIGGILY WAS JUST GOING TO SLEEP AGAIN AND HE WAS WONDERING WHY IT TOOK TOMMIE SO LONG TO FIND MORE STRING FOR THE KITE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A RUSTLING IN THE BUSHES AND OUT JUMPED THE BAD OLD BABBOON
EACH OF US A GOLDEN CROWN ON HIS HEAD KING SOLOMON SMILED AND ANSWERED CROWNS OF GOLD SHALL YOU HAVE BUT YOU ARE FOOLISH BIRDS MY HOOPOES AND WHEN THE EVIL DAYS SHALL COME UPON YOU AND YOU SEE THE FOLLY OF YOUR DESIRE
AND AFTER THAT IS DONE
SOLOMON WAS EVER SEEKING TO GROW EVEN WISER THE BETTER TO KNOW THE WONDERS OF GOD'S WORLD AND THE WAYS OF ALL CREATURES HE UNDERTOOK MANY JOURNEYS NOT AS WE ORDINARY POOR MORTALS TRAVEL
AND THEN HE AND UNCLE WIGGILY WENT TO A CLEAR OPEN PLACE IN THE FIELDS NEAR THE WOODS TO FLY IT THERE WAS A GOOD WIND BLOWING
AND STOOD ONCE MORE BEFORE THE STEPS OF HIS GOLDEN THRONE WITH TEARS AND GROANS HE RELATED THE SAD FORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIS GOLDEN CROWNED RACE
NO UNCLE WIGGILY I CAN NOT WHY IS MY KITE LIKE BUDDY THE GUINEA PIG BOY BECAUSE LAUGHED THE OLD RABBIT GENTLEMAN THIS KITE HAS NO TAIL AND NEITHER HAS BUDDY
AND HOW GLAD ONE WOULD BE NOWADAYS TO HAVE SUCH KNOWLEDGE SOLOMON WAS ESPECIALLY FOND OF BIRDS AND LOVED TO TALK WITH THEM BECAUSE THEIR VOICES WERE SO SWEET AND THEY SPOKE SUCH BEAUTIFUL WORDS ONE DAY
SAMMY WAS SO RELIEVED TO THINK THAT CHATTERER WAS NOT DEAD AND HE WAS SO TICKLED TO THINK THAT CHATTERER WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT HIMSELF SO SMART SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT
WHO WANTED TO WEAR THEM TO A PARTY MISSUS CLUCK CLUCK THE HEN LADY WAS GOING TO HAVE NEXT WEEK AND NOW TO MAKE THE KITE CRIED TOMMIE AS HE AND UNCLE WIGGILY REACHED THE HOUSE WHERE THE KAT FAMILY LIVED
ONLY OF COURSE NO ONE RODE ON THE KITE HAVE YOU ANY MORE STRING UNCLE WIGGILY ASKED THE KITTEN BOY AFTER A BIT STRING TOMMIE WHAT FOR
BIDDING HER FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF FATE AND COME TO THE COURT OF THE WISE KING THIS NOTE HE SEALED WITH MUSK STAMPED WITH HIS GREAT SIGNET AND GAVE TO THE HOOPOE SAYING IF NOW YOU HAVE SPOKEN TRUTH
FOR LIFE WAS NOT SO DREADFUL A THING AFTER ALL AND HE GAVE HER PERMISSION TO BUILD HER NEST UNDER THE WALLS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE WHICH HE WAS BUILDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HOUSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD
CONTENTMENT IS THE GREATEST HAPPINESS IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MOST PEOPLE NEVER TO HAVE BEEN BORN CROONED THE MELANCHOLY TURTLE DOVE THE HAPPY LITTLE SWALLOW GAVE HER OPINION DO GOOD
WHO HAD ONCE BEFORE MADE TROUBLE FOR THE BUNNY UNCLE
AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED HEREAFTER THE HARSH CRY OF THE PEACOCK MEANT AS THOU JUDGEST SO SHALT THOU BE JUDGED THE HOOPOE SAID HE WHO HAS NO PITY FOR OTHERS WILL FIND NONE FOR HIMSELF
THAT WILL BE FUN CRIED TOMMIE
WHO WAS ABLE TO FIND WATER IN WHATSOEVER PLACE HE MIGHT BE RESTING THUS THE COCK AND THE HOOPOE BECAME SOLOMON'S CLOSEST COMPANIONS BUT OF THE TWO THE HOOPOE WAS HIS FAVORITE THE HOOPOE IS AN EASTERN BIRD AND WE DO NOT SEE HIM IN AMERICA
DIDN'T YOU PROMISE TO GO TO THE FIVE AND TEN CENT STORE FOR ME AND BUY ME A PAIR OF DIAMOND EARRINGS ASKED NURSE JANE FUZZY WUZZY THE MUSKRAT LADY HOUSEKEEPER OH SO I DID
BUT NOW THAT THERE MAY BE A MEMORIAL OF THE SERVICE WHICH ONCE YOU DID ME YOUR CROWNS OF GOLD SHALL BE CHANGED INTO CROWNS OF FEATHERS AND WITH THEM YOU MAY WALK UNHARMED UPON THE EARTH
OH I WANTED YOU TO COME AND HELP ME BUILD A KITE AND THEN COME WITH ME AND FLY IT SAID THE KITTEN BOY
AND HER BEAUTY UNTIL SOLOMON SIGHED A GREAT SIGH AND SAID IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE BUT WE SHALL SEE SO THE KING WROTE A LETTER TO BALKIS
IN A THICK CLOUD OVER THE HEAD OF SOLOMON WHILE HE CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY IN GRATITUDE THE WISE KING OFFERED TO GIVE HIS FEATHERED FRIENDS WHATEVER REWARD THEY MIGHT ASK
SOME YEARS AFTERWARD THE DOVES HAD SO INCREASED IN NUMBERS THAT WITH THEIR EXTENDED WINGS THEY FORMED A VEIL OVER THE NUMBERLESS PILGRIMS WHO CAME TO JERUSALEM TO VISIT THE WONDERFUL TEMPLE
DURING THE JOURNEY ABOVE THE AERIAL CARAVAN FLUTTERED A CLOUD OF BIRDS
TOMMIE RAN HOLDING THE STRING THAT WAS FAST TO THE KITE AND UP AND UP AND UP IT WENT IN THE AIR SOON IT WAS SAILING QUITE NEAR THE CLOUDS
FOR IT SOUNDED SO EXACTLY LIKE CHATTERER WHEN HE HAD BEEN A FREE LITTLE IMP OF MISCHIEF IN THE GREEN FOREST THAT SAMMY FELT SURE THAT CHATTERER HAD NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIM
WELL PERHAPS I COULD SAID THE BUNNY UNCLE I WILL FIRST GO TO THE STORE AND GET NURSE JANE'S DIAMOND EARRINGS THEN ON THE WAY BACK I'LL STOP AND HELP YOU WITH YOUR KITE
BUT MORE THAN THIS HE COULD TALK WITH EVERYTHING THAT LIVED TREES AND FLOWERS BEASTS AND FOWLS CREEPING THINGS AND FISHES WHAT A VERY PLEASANT THING THAT WAS FOR SOLOMON TO BE SURE
AND THE QUEEN OF THE HOOPOES BECAME VERY AIRY AND REFUSED TO SPEAK TO HER OWN COUSIN AND TO THE OTHER BIRDS WHO HAD ONCE BEEN HER FRIENDS THERE WAS A CERTAIN FOWLER WHO USED TO SET TRAPS FOR BIRDS
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY FEELING HIMSELF BEING PULLED AT FIRST
I NEVER SAW A CROWN LIKE THIS UPON ANY BIRD I MUST ASK ABOUT THIS
OF SILVER OF WOOD FOR THE MULTITUDE OF PERSONS OF DIFFERENT RANK WHOM HE TOOK WITH HIM THERE WAS ALSO NO LACK OF THE MOST GORGEOUS FURNITURE
SAMMY FAIRLY ACHED ALL OVER TO SPREAD THE NEWS THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST AND OVER THE GREEN MEADOWS YOU KNOW HE IS A GREAT GOSSIP AND THIS WAS SUCH UNUSUAL NEWS SAMMY KNEW VERY WELL THAT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE HIM
SO IT WAS SAY THE MUSSULMANS THAT A BIRD TOLD SOLOMON OF THE GREAT QUEEN WHOSE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM IS DESCRIBED IN THE BIBLE
BIRD LIME WAS MADE IN EVERY TOWN AND THE PRICE OF TRAPS ROSE IN THE MARKET SO THAT THE TRAP MAKERS BECAME RICH MEN NOT A HOOPOE COULD SHOW HIS UNLUCKY HEAD WITHOUT BEING SLAIN OR TAKEN CAPTIVE
KNOWING ALL THE TIME THAT CHATTERER COULDN'T TAKE A WALK WITH ANY ONE
KING SOLOMON AND THE BIRDS KING SOLOMON WAS WISER THAN ALL MEN AND HIS FAME WAS IN ALL NATIONS ROUND ABOUT JERUSALEM HE WAS SO WISE THAT HE KNEW EVERY SPOKEN LANGUAGE YES
BUT HE WAS A PRISONER AND HAVING THESE VISITORS MADE HIM REALIZE IT MORE THAN EVER SOMETHING VERY LIKE TEARS FILLED HIS EYES AND HE CREPT INTO HIS HOLLOW STUMP
WHEN ALL WAS READY SOLOMON WAS WONT TO SEAT HIMSELF UPON HIS THRONE AND WOULD COMMAND THE WINDS TO DO THEIR DUTY
THEY GREW VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY THEY WENT DOWN BY THE LAKES AND POOLS
EVERY ONE TURNED FOWLER AND BEGAN TO HUNT THE PRECIOUS BIRDS
AS HE HELD IT UP AND CAN YOU TELL ME TOMMIE WHY YOUR KITE IS LIKE BUDDY THE GUINEA PIG BOY CAN I TELL YOU WHY MY KITE IS LIKE BUDDY THE GUINEA PIG BOY REPEATED TOMMIE LIKE A MAN IN A MINSTREL SHOW
O FOOLISH CREATURES WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED TALKING KING SOLOMON SOFTLY STROKED THE HEAD OF THE PRETTY LITTLE DOVE
RIGHT AWAY PETER'S HEAD BOBBED UP FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A JACK IN THE BOX AND THIS TIME IT STAYED UP PETER'S EYES WERE ROUND WITH SURPRISE AS HE STARED ACROSS AT CHATTERER'S PRISON
BUT OF ALL THE WINGED SINGERS WHO SPOKE THAT DAY IN THE GARDEN THE WISE KING CHOSE TO HAVE EVER NEAR HIM THE COCK BECAUSE HE HAD SPOKEN WORDS OF PIETY AND THE NIMBLE HOOPOE BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO PLUNGE HIS CLEAR GAZE
LOOKING AT THE KITE STRING WHICH WAS PULLING AT THE STUMP VERY HARD NOW BUT BEFORE YOU TAKE ME AWAY WOULD YOU MIND PULLING DOWN TOMMIE'S KITE ASKED THE BUNNY UNCLE I'LL LEAVE IT FOR HIM YES
SOME OF HER CLEVER QUESTIONS TO PROVE HIS WISDOM SO SHE DECIDED TO ACCEPT HIS INVITATION AND COME TO JERUSALEM SHE CAME WITH A GREAT TRAIN OF ATTENDANTS WITH CAMELS THAT BORE SPICES AND TREASURES OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES
RETURN HERE TO ME AND I WILL HELP YOU YET AGAIN SO THE KING OF THE HOOPOES LEFT KING SOLOMON WITH A BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN CROWN UPON HIS HEAD AND SOON ALL THE HOOPOES WERE WEARING GOLDEN CROWNS THEREUPON
THAT HE JUST HAD TO TORMENT CHATTERER BY LAUGHING AT HIM AND SAYING MEAN THINGS TO HIM UNTIL CHATTERER LOST HIS TEMPER AND SAID THINGS BACK QUITE IN THE OLD WAY THIS TICKLED SAMMY MORE THAN EVER
OR THE BAD FOX TRYING TO DRAG HIM OFF TO HIS DEN AND UNCLE WIGGILY OPENING HIS EYES CRIED HERE STOP THAT IF YOU PLEASE DON'T PULL ME SO BUT WHEN HE LOOKED AROUND HE COULD SEE NO ONE
THE EAGLE SWOOPED DOWN AND WOULD HAVE SEIZED THE CULPRIT ROUGHLY IN HIS STRONG TALONS BUT THE HOOPOE BEGGED HIM FOR SOLOMON'S SAKE TO BE GENTLE FOR SOLOMON'S SAKE CRIED THE EAGLE DO YOU DARE TO NAME THE KING WHOM YOU HAVE INJURED
THIS TIME I HAVE CAUGHT YOU YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM ME NOW I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU OFF TO MY DEN OH PLEASE DON'T BEGGED UNCLE WIGGILY YES I SHALL TOO BLABBERED THE BABBOON
THE TRAVELLER ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE THE THING SWAY AND SWING TO THE WIND THEN THE TRAIN WOULD SWEEP THROUGH A TUNNEL OR SWING ROUND A SHARP BEND AND FAR UP AMONG THE SUMMITS MIGHT BE SEEN A MULE TEAM OR A STRING OF PACK HORSES WINDING ROUND THE SHOULDERS OF THE ROCK
WHEN THE ROAD OPENED THERE WAS A RUSH OF HURDY GURDY GIRLS FOR DANCE HALLS BUT THAT DID NOT MODIFY THE ROUGH CHIVALRY OF AN UNWRITTEN LAW THESE HURDY GURDY GIRLS WHO TIPTOED TO THE CONCERTINA THE FIDDLE AND THE HAND ORGAN
OR THE EXPRESS OFFICE AT YALE IF ONE COULD GET A SEAT OUTSIDE WITH THE GUARDS AND THE DRIVER ONE WHO KNEW HOW TO UNLOCK THE LORE OF THESE SONS OF THE HILLS HE WAS LUCKY FOR HE WOULD LEARN WHO MADE HIS STRIKE THERE WHO WAS MURDERED AT ANOTHER PLACE
THE TIME GOING IN AND OUT VARIED BUT THE JOURNEY COULD BE MADE IN FIVE DAYS AND WAS OFTEN MADE IN FOUR THE BUILDING OF THE CARIBOO ROAD HAD AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON THE CAMP THAT ITS BUILDERS COULD NOT FORESEE
HOW THE SNEAK THIEF TRAILED THE TENDERFOOT SOMEWHERE ELSE ALL OF IT ROMANCE MUCH OF IT FICTION MUCH OF IT FACT BUT NO FICTION HALF SO MARVELLOUS AS THE FACT BULL TEAMS OF TWENTY YOKES
BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T UP SHARP GRADES WHERE NO HORSES OUGHT TO BE DRIVEN AT A TROT BUT WHERE THE SIX PERSISTED IN GOING AT A GALLOP THE PASSENGER DIDN'T MIND THE JOLTING THAT ALMOST DISLOCATED HIS SPINE
AT FIRST THERE WAS NOTHING BUT A MULE TRAIL HACKED OUT OF THE ROCK FROM YALE TO SPUZZUM BUT MINERS WENT VOLUNTARILY TO WORK AND WIDENED THE BRIDLE PATH ABOVE THE SHELVING WATERS FROM SPUZZUM TO LYTTON
HE WAS THANKFUL NOT TO BE HELD UP BY HIGHWAYMEN OR DUMPED INTO THE WILD CATARACT OF WATERS BELOW OUTSIDE WAS A CHANGING PANORAMA OF MOUNTAIN AND CANYON WITH A WORLD OF FORESTS AND LAKES
WHEN BEGBIE CAME MISTER ALEXANDER ONE OF THE OVERLANDERS OF SIXTY TWO TELLS HOW BEGBIE'S DECISIONS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN GOOD LAW BUT THEY WERE FIRST CLASS JUSTICE HIS DOCTRINE WAS THAT IF A MAN WERE KILLED
NOT THE STATELY WALTZ BUT A WILD FLING TO SHAKE THE RAFTERS AND TIRE OUT THE STOUTEST MINERS A NEWSPAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN BARKERVILLE
THE FARE CONSISTED OF HAM FRIED IN SLABS EGGS ANCIENT AND TRANSFORMED TO LEATHER IN LARD SLAPJACKS KNOWN AS ROCKY MOUNTAIN DEAD SHOT IN MAPLE SYRUP THAT NEVER SAW A MAPLE TREE AND WAS BLACK AS A POT AND POTATOES IN SOGGY PYRAMIDS
IT HAD SIMPLY CHANGED FROM A POOR MAN'S CAMP TO A CAMP FOR A CAPITALIST OR A COMPANY IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE MINERS FIRST FOUND THE GOLD IN FLAKES THEN FARTHER UP IN NUGGETS THEN THAT THE NUGGETS HAD TO BE PURSUED TO PAY DIRT BENEATH GRAVEL AND CLAY
HAD BEEN KILLED BY FALLING OVER A CLIFF BEGBIE ON HIS OWN AUTHORITY ORDERED THE AMERICAN SEIZED AND TAKEN DOWN TO VICTORIA ON HIS WAY DOWN THE PRISONER ESCAPED FROM THE CONSTABLE THIS TYPE OF HAIR TRIGGER GUNMEN AT ONCE FLED THE COUNTRY
CHAPTER EIGHT THE CARIBOO ROAD WHEN THE RAILWAY FIRST WENT THROUGH THE FRASER CANYON PASSENGERS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOWS ANYWHERE FROM YALE TO ASHCROFT WERE AMAZED TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE A JACOB'S LADDER UP AND DOWN THE MOUNTAINS
SINGS THE POET OF CARIBOO THEY DANCED A NICHT IN DRESSES LICHT FRA LATE UNTIL THE EARLY O BUT O THEIR HEARTS WERE HARD AS FLINT WHICH VEXED THE LADDIES SAIRLY O
HE WAS A VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IN HIMSELF THROUGH SHEER FORCE OF PERSONALITY CRIME DID NOT FLOURISH WHERE BEGBIE WENT CHINAMAN OR INDIAN COULD BE AS SURE OF JUSTICE AS THE RICHEST MINER IN CARIBOO
ON ANOTHER OCCASION WHEN AN AMERICAN HAD ACCIDENTALLY SHOT AN INDIAN THE CORONER RENDERED A VERDICT WORRIED TO DEATH BY A DOG BEGBIE ORDERED ANOTHER INQUEST
WAS OF A SORT TO DISCOUNT FICTION ONE MAN TOOK OUT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GOLD NUGGETS A LUNATIC ESCAPED FROM A MADHOUSE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE FOOLISH HE CAME TO THE BEST SALOON OF BARKERVILLE
AND EVEN AS HIGH AS FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY THERE IS A LETTER WRITTEN BY SIR MATTHEW BEGBIE DESCRIBING HOW THE MOUNTAIN TRAILS WERE INFESTED THAT WINTER BY DESPERADOES LYING IN WAIT FOR THE MINERS WHO CAME STAGGERING OVER THE TRAIL
THE STAID OVERLANDERS WHO HAD RISKED THEIR LIVES TO REACH THIS WILD LAND OF DESIRE WHO HAD COME FROM SUCH CHURCH GOING HAMLETS AS WHITBY SUCH SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN CENTRES AS TORONTO AND MONTREAL
FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE NEW HIGH BOOTS AND A DEVIL MAY CARE AIR THAT DECEIVED NO ONE BUT HIMSELF A FEW SHUSWAPS AND SIWASHES FAT ILL SMELLING INSOLENT AND PLAINLY HIGHLY AMUSED
A GAMBLER PRETENDING THAT HE WAS A MILLIONAIRE A SALOON KEEPER WITH A FEW THOUSANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND A DIAMOND IN HIS SHIRT THE SIZE OF A PEBBLE A TENDERFOOT RIGGED OUT AS A VETERAN WITH BUCKSKIN COAT A BELT FULL OF ARTILLERY
WHEN THE DANCE HALL BECAME THE THEATRE OF BARKERVILLE JAMES ANDERSON USED TO SING HIS RHYMES TO THE STENTORIOUS SHOUTING
BEFORE THE ROAD WAS BUILT ADVENTURERS HAD ARRIVED IN CARIBOO EXPECTING TO PICK UP PAILS OF NUGGETS AT THE BOTTOM OF A RAINBOW THEIR DISILLUSIONMENT CAME BUT THERE WAS AN EASY WAY BACK TO THE WORLD THEY DID NOT STAY TO BREED CRIME AND LAWLESSNESS IN THE CAMP
WASHED UP ON THE BARS OF SNEAK THIEVES GIVEN THIRTY NINE LASHES AND LIKE THE SCAPEGOAT TURNED OUT INTO THE MOUNTAIN WILDS A ROUGH AND READY JUSTICE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT JUDGE OR JURY BUT A WOMAN WAS AS SAFE ON THE TRAIL AS IN HER OWN HOME
THE CARIBOO ROAD BECAME TO BRITISH COLUMBIA WHAT THE APPIAN WAY WAS TO ROME IT WAS EIGHTEEN FEET WIDE AND OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILES LONG IT WAS ONE OF THE FINEST ROADS EVER BUILT IN THE WORLD
FROM HATING AND FEARING HIM THE CAMP CAME ALMOST TO WORSHIP HIM MANY ARE THE STORIES OF HIS CIRCUITS ONCE A JURY PERSISTED IN BRINGING IN A VERDICT OF MANSLAUGHTER IN PLACE OF MURDER PRISONER
CHAPTER SEVEN LIFE AT THE MINES
LITERALLY WEIGHTED DOWN WITH GOLD THE MINERS FOUND WHAT THE GREAT BANKS HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT THE PRESENCE OF UNUSED GOLD IS A NUISANCE AND A CURSE THEY HAD TO LUG THE GOLD IN LEATHER SACKS WITH THEM TO THEIR WORK
THE DRIVER WAS ALWAYS A CRACK WHIP A MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF AN OLD TIMER THOUGH OFTEN HIS YEARS NUMBERED FEWER THAN TWENTY MOST OF THE DRIVERS HOWEVER KNEW THE TRAIL FROM HAVING PACKED IN ON SHANKS'S MARE AND CAMPED UNDER THE STARS
AND THE ROAD WAS GOOD ESPECIALLY FOR THUGS WHILE THERE WERE TEN THOUSAND MEN IN CARIBOO IN THE WINTER OF SIXTY TWO AND PERHAPS TWENTY THOUSAND IN THE WINTER OF SIXTY THREE THERE WERE LESS THAN FIVE THOUSAND IN SEVENTY ONE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE CAMP HAD COLLAPSED
THE PACKERS ASCENDED THE MOUNTAINS EIGHT HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE ROARING CANYON WHERE CLIFFS BROKE OFF THEY SENT THE ANIMALS ACROSS AN INDIAN BRIDGE THE MARVEL IS NOT THAT MANY A POOR BEAST FELL HEADLONG EIGHT HUNDRED FEET DOWN THE PRECIPICE
HE THINKS HIS PILE IS MADE AN HE'S GOIN HAME THIS FALL
HIS LORDSHIP'S HUMBLE SERVANT HE WI'OUT A THOUGHT O GUILE
AND THERE WAS ALWAYS DANGER ENOUGH TO ADD ZEST TO THE JOURNEY WHEREVER THERE ARE HORDES OF HUNGRY ADVENTUROUS MEN THERE WILL BE DESPERADOES IN SPITE OF BEGBIE'S JUSTICE ROBBERIES OCCURRED ON THE ROAD AND NOT A FEW MURDERS
AND THE JUDGE SO CHARGED THE JURY BUT THE JURY ACQUITTED THE PRISONER DEAD SILENCE FELL IN THE COURT ROOM THE PRISONER'S COUNSEL AROSE AND REQUESTED THE DISCHARGE OF THE MAN BEGBIE WHIRLED PRISONER AT THE BAR
AND WHEN THE STAGE WITH A CRACK OF THE WHIP AND A PRANCE OF THE SIX HORSES CAME RATTLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND ROLLING INTO YALE THE FAT GIRL WOULD BE THE FIRST TO DEPOSIT HER AMPLE PERSON AT THE BANK OR THE EXPRESS OFFICE WHENCE GOLD COULD SAFELY BE SENT ON DOWN TO VICTORIA
ON THE DOWN TRIP BAGS WERE PILED ON THE ROOF WITH A COUPLE OF FRONTIERSMEN ARMED WITH RIFLES TO GUARD THEM MANY WERE THE DEVICES OF A RETURNING MINER FOR CONCEALING THE GOLD WHICH HE HAD WON A FAT HURDY GURDY GIRL OR SOMETIMES A SQUAW WOULD CLIMB TO A PLACE IN THE STAGE
AND WHEN THE GIRLS PASSED TO AND FROM THEIR TEMPORARY LODGING THEIR PROGRESS WAS LIKE A ROYAL PROCESSION THROUGH A SILENT GAPING BUT MOST RESPECTFUL LANE OF WHISKERED FACES A MAN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT RESPECT WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN ON THE SPOT
AND BACK WITH THEM TO THEIR SHACKS AND THEY ALWAYS CARRIED FIREARMS READY FOR USE THERE WAS VERY LITTLE SHOOTING AT THE MINES BUT IF A BAD MAN TURNED UP MISSING
I KEN A BODY MADE A STRIKE HE LOOKED A LITTLE LORD
WE LAUGH NOW VICTORIA DID NOT LAUGH THEN IT WAS ALL TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY
AN NOO THE PUIR SOUL'S LEFT ALANE WI NOCHT TO WEET HIS THROTTLE IN BARKERVILLE WHICH BECAME THE CENTRE OF CARIBOO SALOONS AND DANCE HALLS GREW UP OVERNIGHT PIANOS WERE PACKED IN ON MULES AT A RATE OF A DOLLAR A POUND FROM QUESNEL
APPEARING IN PLACES TO HANG ALMOST IN MID AIR BETWEEN YALE AND LYTTON IT HUGGED THE MOUNTAIN SIDE ON WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SHELF OF ROCK DIRECTLY ABOVE THE WILDEST WATER OF THE CANYON CRIB WORK OF HUGE TREES RESEMBLING IN THE DISTANCE THE WOVEN PATTERN OF A WILLOW BASKET
INSIDE WAS A DRAMA OF HUMAN NATURE TO OUTDO ANY CURTAIN RAISER HE HAD EVER WITNESSED A BARONET WHO HAD LOST IN THE GAME AND WAS GOING HOME PENNILESS PERHAPS EARNING HIS WAY BY HELPING WITH THE HORSES AN OUTWORN ACTRESS WHO HAD BEEN TRYING HER LUCK AT THE DANCE HALLS
AGAINST ANY DECISION OF THE GOLD COMMISSIONERS BEGBIE WAS THE SOLE APPEAL AND IN ALL THE LONG YEARS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION NO DECISION OF HIS WAS EVER CHALLENGED THE EFFECT OF SUDDEN WEALTH ON SOME OF THE HUNGRY RAGGED HORDE WHO INFESTED CARIBOO
THERE WAS STILL A BASKET OF CHAMPAGNE LEFT HE DANCED THE HURDY GURDY ON THAT BASKET TILL HE CUT HIS FEET THE CHAMPAGNE WAS ALL GONE BUT HE STILL HAD SOME GOLD NUGGETS THERE WAS A MIRROR IN THE BAR ROOM VALUED AT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS
BUT HOO I'VE LIVED SYNE MY FREEND
WITH CARE CREEP UP FROM LANGLEY TO HOPE AND YALE AND THE FARES CHARGED AFFORDED A GOOD REVENUE TO THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY EVEN WHEN PROSPECTORS STRUCK ABOVE YALE
A THING THAT CIVILIZATION NEVER UNDERSTANDS ABOUT A WILD MINING CAMP MISSUS CAMERON WIFE OF THE FAMOUS CARIBOO CAMERON LIVED WITH HER HUSBAND ON HIS CLAIM TILL SHE DIED AND MANY OTHER WOMEN LIVED IN THE CAMPS WITH THEIR HUSBANDS
YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY PERMIT ME TO SAY THAT IT WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE TO SENTENCE YOU TO BE HANGED EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR BRINGING IN A MURDERER GUILTY ONLY OF MANSLAUGHTER
THE CAMELS THEMSELVES COULD STAND NEITHER THE CLIMATE NOR THE HARD ROCK ROAD THEY WERE TURNED ADRIFT ON THE THOMPSON RIVER WHERE THE LAST OF THEM DIED IN NINETEEN O FIVE THERE WAS SOMETHING HIGHLY ROMANTIC IN THE STAGE COACH TRAVEL OF THIS HALCYON ERA
HE HAD LESS REGARD FOR RED TAPE THAN MOST CHIEF JUSTICES LIKE DOUGLAS HE FIRST MAINTAINED LAW AND ORDER AND THEN LOOKED UP TO SEE IF HE HAD ANY AUTHORITY FOR IT
OR FROM THE OKANAGAN TO THE THOMPSON THE DIFFICULTIES OF TRANSPORTATION WERE SOON SURMOUNTED A ROAD WAS SHORTLY OPENED FROM HARRISON LAKE TO LILLOOET
SHATTERING IT IN COUNTLESS PIECES THEN HE WENT OUT IN THE NIGHT TO SLEEP UNDER THE STARS PENNILESS HE SETTLED DOWN TO WORK FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN OTHER MEN'S MINES
AFTER THE COLONY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA HAD TAKEN ITS PLACE ON THE POLITICAL MAP THAT GOVERNOR DOUGLAS WAS PUT TO THE TASK OF BUILDING A GREAT ROAD HENCEFORTH FOR A FEW YEARS AT LEAST THE MINERS WOULD BE THE BACKBONE IF NOT THE WHOLE BODY OF THE NEW COLONY
DRAWN BY SIX HORSES ROAD HOUSES ALONG THE WAY PROVIDED RELAYS OF FRESH HORSES FREIGHT WENT IN BY BULL TEAM BUT PACK HORSES AND MULES WERE STILL USED TO CARRY MINERS PROVISIONS TO THE CAMPS IN THE HILLS WHICH LAY OFF THE MAIN ROAD
IT WAS WHILE THE ROAD WAS STILL BUILDING THAT AN ENTERPRISING PACKER BROUGHT TWENTY ONE CAMELS ON THE TRAIL THEY WERE NOT A SUCCESS AND CAUSED COUNTLESS STAMPEDES HORSES AND MULES TOOK FRIGHT AT THE SLIGHTEST WHIFF OF THEM
THE WALKING' AS BEGBIE EXPRESSED IT
ON THE INSTANT EVERY GIRL WAS OFFERED SOME KIND OF SITUATION WHICH SHE VOLUNTARILY AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EXCHANGED FOR MATRIMONY IN ALL SOME NINETY GIRLS CAME OUT UNDER THESE AUSPICES IN SIXTY TWO
LATER LIKE DOUGLAS GIVEN A TITLE FOR HIS SERVICES TO THE EMPIRE HAD AS WE HAVE SEEN FIRST COME OUT UNDER DIRECT APPOINTMENT BY THE CROWN AND WHEN PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT WAS ORGANIZED IN BRITISH COLUMBIA HIS POSITION WAS CONFIRMED AS CHIEF JUSTICE
THIS MEANT SHAFTS TUNNELS HYDRAULIC MACHINERY STAMP MILLS LATER WHEN THE PAY DIRT SHOWED SIGNS OF MERGING INTO QUARTZ THERE PASSED AWAY FOR EVER THE DAY OF THE PENNILESS PROSPECTOR
JUS TWA POOND STERLING SURE AS DEATH IT SHOULD BE FOUR BETWEEN US BAITH
YET SO KEEN WAS THE MOUNTAIN AIR SO STIMULATING THE OZONE OF THE RESINOUS HEMLOCK FORESTS THAT THE MOST FASTIDIOUS TRAVELLER FELT HE HAD FARED SUMPTUOUSLY AND GAILY PAID THE TWO FIFTY FOR THE MEAL
AS SUITABLE WIVES FOR THE BRITISH COLUMBIA MINERS ALACK THE DAY THERE WAS NO POET TO SEND LETTERS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD ON THIS HANDLING OF CUPID'S BOW AND ARROW THE COMEDY WAS PUSHED IN THE MOST BUSINESS LIKE FASHION
THE RIVER LEDGES SEEMED ALMOST IMPASSABLE FOR PACK ANIMALS YET A CABLE FERRY WAS RIGGED UP AT SPUZZUM AND MULES WERE SENT OVER THE LEDGES TO DRAW IT UP THE RIVER WHEN THE WATER ROSE SO HIGH THAT THE LOWER LEDGES WERE UNSAFE
SOME ONE HAD TO BE HANGED FOR IT AND THE EFFECT WAS SALUTARY A MAN HAD BEEN SANDBAGGED IN A VICTORIA SALOON AND THROWN OUT TO DIE HIS COMPANION IN THE SALOON WAS ARRESTED AND TRIED THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WAS STRONG
THE PASSENGER JUMPED FOR A PLACE IN THE COACH THE LONG WHIP CRACKED THE HORSES SPRANG FORWARD AND AWAY THE STAGE RATTLED ROUND CURVES WHERE A HIND WHEEL WOULD TRY TO GO OVER THE EDGE ONLY THE DRIVER DIDN'T LET IT DOWN EMBANKMENTS WHERE ANY NORMAL WAGON WOULD HAVE UPSET
AND WHEN SHE EMERGED HALF AN HOUR LATER SHE WOULD HAVE THINNED PERCEPTIBLY THEN THE ROUGH MINER WHO HAD NOT ADDRESSED A WORD TO HER ON THE WAY DOWN FOR FEAR OF A CONFIDENCE MAN ABOARD WOULD PRESENT SUSY WITH A HANDSOME REWARD IN THE FORM OF A GAUDY DRESS OR A YEAR'S PROVISIONS
AND AS TO THE THOMPSON THERE WAS THE WELL WORN TRAIL OF THE FUR TRADERS WHO HAD BEEN GOING OVERLAND TO KAMLOOPS FOR FIFTY YEARS IT WAS WHEN GOLD WAS DISCOVERED HIGHER UP ON THE FRASER AND IN CARIBOO
SEEKING THE GOLDEN FLEECE OF THE HILLS AS HIS PREDECESSOR THE TRAPPER HAD SOUGHT THE PELT OF THE LITTLE BEAVER
HOW COULD THE ADMINISTRATION BE CARRIED ON IF THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO ROAD INTO THE MINING REGION AND SO THE GOVERNOR OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ENTERED ON THE BOLDEST UNDERTAKING IN ROADBUILDING EVER LAUNCHED BY ANY COMMUNITY OF TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE
TRIED AND IN SPITE OF STRONG EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM ACQUITTED BEGBIE ADJOURNED THE COURT WITH THE PIOUS WISH THAT THE MURDERER SHOULD GO OUT AND CUT THE THROATS OF THE JURY BUT
OR WHETHER HE HUNG AS A SIGN OF WARNING FROM A POLE SET HORIZONTALLY AT A PROPER HEIGHT BETWEEN TWO TREES IN A MINING CAMP THERE IS NO MERCY FOR THE CROOK
LONG LINES OF PACK HORSES LED BY A BELL MARE MULE TEAMS WITH A TINKLING OF BELLS AND SINGING OF THE DRIVERS MET THE STAGE AND PASSED WITH HAPPY SALUTE AT NIGHTFALL THE CAMP FIRES OF FOOT TRAVELLERS COULD BE SEEN DOWN AT THE WATER'S EDGE
NOT UNNATURALLY THE SHE CAMPS HEARD THE CALL FROM MACEDONIA THE BISHOP OF OXFORD THE BISHOP OF LONDON THE LORD MAYOR OF LONDON AND A COLONIAL SOCIETY IN ENGLAND GATHERED UP SOME INDUSTRIOUS YOUNG WOMEN
THE MINER STOOD AND PROUDLY SURVEYED HIS OWN FIGURE IN THE GLASS HAD HE NOT WON HIS DEAREST DESIRE AND CONQUERED ALL THINGS IN CONQUERING FORTUNE HE GATHERED HIS LAST NUGGETS AND HURLED THEM IN HANDFULS AT THE MIRROR
AND FOLLOW A TRAIL APPARENTLY SECURE ONLY FOR A MOUNTAIN GOAT THE FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE THING MUST BE AN OLD INDIAN WAR PATH ALONG WHICH NO ENEMY COULD PURSUE BUT WHEN THE TRAIN PAUSED AT A WATER TANK AND THE TRAVELLER MADE INQUIRY HE WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS NOTHING LESS
THUNDERED BEGBIE IT IS NOT A PLEASANT DUTY TO ME TO SENTENCE YOU ONLY TO PRISON FOR LIFE YOU DESERVE TO BE HANGED HAD THE JURY PERFORMED THEIR DUTY I MIGHT HAVE THE PAINFUL SATISFACTION OF CONDEMNING YOU TO DEATH
BOOTS STILL COST FIFTY DOLLARS SUCH LUXURIES AS MIRRORS AND STOVES COST AS HIGH AS SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH THE HURDY GURDY GIRLS WITH TRUE GERMAN THRIFT CHARGED TEN DOLLARS OR MORE A DANCE
SAWNEY HAD YE YER TATERS HERE AND NEEPS AND CARROTS DINNA SPEER WHAT PRICE THOUGH I MIGHT TELL YE WEEL YE'D AINLY THINK ME A LEEIN CHIEL THE FIRST TWA YEARS I SPENT OUT HERE
LIKE FITBA KNOCKIT BACK AND FORE THAT'S LANG IN REACHIN GOAL OR FEATHER BLOWN BY ILKA WIND THAT WHISTLES TWEEN EACH POLE E'EN SAE MY MINING LIFE HAS BEEN FOR MONY A WEARY DAY LATER
THE RESPECTABLE GIRLS FITTED IN WHERE THEY BELONGED THE DISREPUTABLE ALSO FOUND THEIR OWN PLACES AND THE MINING CAMP BEGAN TO TAKE ON AN APPEARANCE OF DOMESTICITY AND HOME MATTHEW BEGBIE
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO BE DONE IN THE MINING COUNTRY AND MEN WERE IN HIGH DEMAND THE ORDINARY WAGE WAS TEN DOLLARS A DAY AND MEN WHO COULD BE TRUSTED AND WHO WERE BRAVE ENOUGH TO PACK THE GOLD OUT TO THE COAST RECEIVED TWENTY
CHAMPAGNE IN PINT BOTTLES SOLD AT TWO OUNCES OF GOLD POTATOES RETAILED AT NINETY DOLLARS A HUNDREDWEIGHT NAILS WERE CHEAP AT A DOLLAR A POUND MILK WAS RETAILED FROZEN AT A DOLLAR A POUND
THE DOLLAR WAS THEIR ONLY LOVE AND THAT THEY LOVED FU DEARLY O THEY DINNA CARE A FLEA FOR MEN LET THEM COURT HOOE'ER SINCERELY O CARIBOO WAS WHAT THE MINERS CALL A HE CAMP
HARDLY KNEW WHETHER THEY WERE DREAMING OR LIVING IN A COUNTRY OF CRAZY PIXIES WHO DELVED IN MUD AND WATER ALL DAY AND WELTERED IN CHAMPAGNE ALL NIGHT THE CARIBOO POET SANG THEIR SENTIMENTS IN THESE WORDS
PERHAPS THERE WAS TIME TO WASH IN THE COMMON TIN BASIN AT THE DOOR WHERE THE TOWEL ALWAYS BORE EVIDENCE OF PATRONAGE PERHAPS NOT ANYHOW NO MATTER WASHING WAS ONLY A TRIVIAL INCIDENT OF MOUNTAIN TRAVEL IN THOSE DAYS
AN INSTRUMENT FOR SHAPING EMPIRE FOR IT WAS THE INRUSH OF MINERS WHICH GAVE BIRTH TO THE COLONY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA FEDERATION WITH THE CANADIAN DOMINION FOLLOWED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE
IN THEIR BEADY WATCHFUL BLACK FERRET EYES AT THE MAD WAYS OF THIS WHITE RACE A STILL MORE ILL SMELLING CHINAMAN AND A TACITURN GRIZZLED RAGGED FELLOW PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE FAT SQUAW KEEPING HIS OBSERVATIONS AND HIS THOUGHTS INSIDE HIS HIGH BOOTS
IN SPITE OF HIS HARSH MANNER TOWARDS THE WRONG DOER THE OLD MAN AS THE MINERS AFFECTIONATELY CALLED HIM KEPT LAW AND ORDER IN THE EARLY DAYS GOLD COMMISSIONERS NOT ONLY SETTLED ALL MINING DISPUTES BUT ACTED AS JUDGE AND JURY
AND WHEN THE ROAD WAS OPENED IN SEPTEMBER PACKERS CHARGES FELL FROM A DOLLAR TO FORTY EIGHT CENTS AND FINALLY TO EIGHTEEN CENTS A POUND BUT PRESENTLY THE TREND OF TRAVEL DREW AWAY FROM HARRISON LAKE TO THE LINE OF THE FRASER
THREESCORE YOUNG GIRLS CAME OUT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE SOCIETY AND THE CHURCH CAREFULLY SHEPHERDED BY A CLERGYMAN AND A STERN MATRON THEY REACHED VICTORIA IN SEPTEMBER OF SIXTY TWO AND WERE HOUSED IN THE BARRACKS
YET IT COST THE COUNTRY ONLY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MILE AS AGAINST THE FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MILE WHICH THE TWO TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAYS SPENT LATER ON THEIR ROADBEDS ALONG THE CANYON
HE CALLED IN GUESTS FROM THE HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS AND TREATED THEM TO CHAMPAGNE WHICH COST THIRTY DOLLARS AND FIFTY DOLLARS A BOTTLE WHEN THE RABBLE COULD DRINK NO MORE CHAMPAGNE HE ORDERED EVERY GLASS FILLED AND PLACED ON THE BAR
THE JURY HAVE SAID YOU ARE NOT GUILTY YOU CAN GO AND I DEVOUTLY HOPE THE NEXT MAN YOU SANDBAG WILL BE ONE OF THE JURY ON ANOTHER OCCASION A MAN WAS FOUND STABBED ON THE CARIBOO ROAD
START FROM A ROAD HOUSE WAS MADE AT DAWN WHEN THE CLOUDS STILL HUNG HEAVY ON THE MOUNTAINS AND THE PEAKS WERE ALL REFLECTED IN THE GLACIAL WATERS THE PASSENGERS TUMBLED DISHEVELLED FROM LOG WALLED ROOMS WHERE THE BEDS WERE BENCH BERTHS
HE STOOD FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE POOREST MINER IN PRIVATE LIFE HE WAS FOND OF MUSIC ART AND LITERATURE BUT IN PUBLIC LIFE HE WAS AUTOCRATIC AS A CZAR AND STERNLY RIGHTEOUS AS A PROPHET
WERE GERMAN AND IF WE MAY BELIEVE THE POET OF CARIBOO THEY WERE SOMETHING LIKE THE GLASGOW GIRLS DESCRIBED BY WOLFE AS COLD TO EVERYTHING BUT A BAGPIPE I WRONG THEM
