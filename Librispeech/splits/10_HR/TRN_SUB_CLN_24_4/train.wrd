MANUFACTURERS AND THE LIKE
YET THERE WAS FOURTEEN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER AS WELL AS FOURTEEN OF THE PLAGUE
BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
HAD MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT TRAVELLED DONE SO THE PLAGUE HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED INTO SO MANY COUNTRY TOWNS AND HOUSES AS IT WAS TO THE GREAT DAMAGE AND INDEED TO THE RUIN OF ABUNDANCE OF PEOPLE
BUT I HAD A FAMILY OF SERVANTS WHOM I KEPT AT MY BUSINESS HAD A HOUSE SHOP AND WAREHOUSES FILLED WITH GOODS AND IN SHORT TO LEAVE THEM ALL AS THINGS IN SUCH A CASE MUST BE LEFT THAT IS TO SAY
UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE WERE FIFTY DIED THAT WEEK OF THE PLAGUE THE NEXT BILL WAS FROM THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY TO THE THIRTIETH WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE PLAGUE WAS SEVENTEEN BUT
AS ANYONE MIGHT PERCEIVE BY THEIR APPEARANCE THIS WAS A VERY TERRIBLE AND MELANCHOLY THING TO SEE AND AS IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT BUT LOOK ON FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
TO GET PASSES AND CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH FOR SUCH AS TRAVELLED ABROAD FOR WITHOUT THESE THERE WAS NO BEING ADMITTED TO PASS THROUGH THE TOWNS UPON THE ROAD OR TO LODGE IN ANY INN
TWENTY MORE WHO WERE REALLY DEAD OF THE PLAGUE IN THAT PARISH BUT HAD BEEN SET DOWN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER OR OTHER DISTEMPERS BESIDES OTHERS CONCEALED
AND IT WAS PRINTED IN THE WEEKLY BILL OF MORTALITY IN THE USUAL MANNER THUS PLAGUE TWO PARISHES INFECTED ONE
BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
NOW AS THERE HAD NONE DIED IN THE CITY FOR ALL THIS TIME MY LORD MAYOR GAVE CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY TO ALL THOSE WHO LIVED IN THE NINETY SEVEN PARISHES AND TO THOSE WITHIN THE LIBERTIES TOO
FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
WERE RETURNING OR SENT FROM THE COUNTRIES TO FETCH MORE PEOPLE BESIDES INNUMERABLE NUMBERS OF MEN ON HORSEBACK SOME ALONE OTHERS WITH SERVANTS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING
IT WAS NOW MID JULY AND THE PLAGUE WHICH HAD CHIEFLY RAGED AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN AND AS I SAID BEFORE IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN
WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AND IN WHICH WAS EMBARKED ALL MY EFFECTS IN THE WORLD AND THE OTHER WAS THE PRESERVATION OF MY LIFE IN SO DISMAL A CALAMITY AS I SAW APPARENTLY WAS COMING UPON THE WHOLE CITY AND WHICH
BUT WE PERCEIVED THE INFECTION KEPT CHIEFLY IN THE OUT PARISHES WHICH BEING VERY POPULOUS AND FULLER ALSO OF POOR THE DISTEMPER FOUND MORE TO PREY UPON THAN IN THE CITY
OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
SAINT JAMES'S SIX BESIDES THIS IT WAS OBSERVED WITH GREAT UNEASINESS BY THE PEOPLE THAT THE WEEKLY BILLS IN GENERAL INCREASED VERY MUCH DURING THESE WEEKS ALTHOUGH IT WAS AT A TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN
SAINT BRIDE'S EIGHT
THIS HURRY I SAY CONTINUED SOME WEEKS THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS RUMOURED THAT AN ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED OUT
A LITTLE HARDENED IT IS TRUE A VAST MANY PEOPLE FLED AS I HAVE OBSERVED YET THEY WERE CHIEFLY FROM THE WEST END OF THE TOWN AND FROM THAT WE CALL THE HEART OF THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY
AND THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE MONARCHY BEING RESTORED HAD FLOCKED TO LONDON TO SETTLE IN BUSINESS OR TO DEPEND UPON AND ATTEND THE COURT FOR REWARDS OF SERVICES PREFERMENTS AND THE LIKE
HOWEVER GREAT IT WAS MY FEARS PERHAPS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE'S REPRESENTED TO BE MUCH GREATER THAN IT COULD BE
AND HAVING THE KEY IN MY POCKET I USED TO GO INTO THE HOUSE AND OVER MOST OF THE ROOMS TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL FOR THOUGH IT BE SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO TELL
BUT THIS WAS ALL KNAVERY AND COLLUSION
AND I BEGAN TO RESOLVE TO GO AND ACCORDINGLY MADE ALL THINGS READY FOR IN SHORT THE INFECTION INCREASED ROUND ME
WHEREAS THE EUROPEANS OR CHRISTIAN MERCHANTS WHO KEPT THEMSELVES RETIRED AND RESERVED GENERALLY ESCAPED THE CONTAGION UPON THESE ARGUMENTS MY BROTHER CHANGED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN
AND AS I HAD ALREADY PREPARED EVERYTHING AS WELL AS I COULD AS TO MY BUSINESS AND WHOM TO ENTRUST MY AFFAIRS WITH I HAD LITTLE TO DO BUT TO RESOLVE I WENT HOME THAT EVENING GREATLY OPPRESSED IN MY MIND
WITHOUT ANY OVERSEER OR PERSON FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH THEM HAD BEEN TO HAZARD THE LOSS NOT ONLY OF MY TRADE BUT OF MY GOODS AND INDEED OF ALL I HAD IN THE WORLD I HAD AN ELDER BROTHER
TO NOTE WHAT BECAME OF ME I HAD TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BEFORE ME
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WENT TO OXFORD WHERE IT PLEASED GOD TO PRESERVE THEM AND THE DISTEMPER DID NOT AS I HEARD OF SO MUCH AS TOUCH THEM FOR WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT
THEY WOULD GO UNCONCERNED INTO INFECTED PLACES AND CONVERSE WITH INFECTED PERSONS BY WHICH MEANS THEY DIED AT THE RATE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND A WEEK
MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
THERE WAS NONE OF THE PLAGUE AND BUT FOUR OF THE SPOTTED FEVER BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT RETURNED AGAIN AND THE DISTEMPER WAS SPREAD INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER PARISHES
IN ONE WEEK SINCE THE PRECEDING VISITATION OF SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX HOWEVER ALL THIS WENT OFF AGAIN AND THE WEATHER PROVING COLD AND THE FROST WHICH BEGAN IN DECEMBER
AND IT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ESPECIALLY AND IN CLARKENWELL SO THAT BY THE SECOND WEEK IN AUGUST CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ALONE BURIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND CLARKENWELL
AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
THERE DIED BUT THREE OF WHICH NOT ONE WITHIN THE WHOLE CITY OR LIBERTIES AND SAINT ANDREW'S BURIED BUT FIFTEEN WHICH WAS VERY LOW
AND AS ALL TOGETHER REGARD THE QUESTION BEFORE HIM AND THEN I THINK HE MAY SAFELY TAKE THEM FOR INTIMATIONS FROM HEAVEN OF WHAT IS HIS UNQUESTIONED DUTY TO DO IN SUCH A CASE I MEAN
AND IN THE SUBURBS IN SOUTHWARK AND IN THE EAST PART SUCH AS WAPPING RATCLIFF STEPNEY ROTHERHITHE AND THE LIKE THE PEOPLE GENERALLY STAYED EXCEPT HERE AND THERE A FEW WEALTHY FAMILIES WHO AS ABOVE
THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
HE WAS AS ABLE TO KEEP ME IN A TIME OF THE INFECTION AS IN A TIME OF HEALTH AND IF HE DID NOT THINK FIT TO DELIVER ME STILL I WAS IN HIS HANDS
ONLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT HIRE A HORSE TO GO OR MY FELLOW WAS RUN AWAY THAT WAS TO ATTEND ME WAS RIDICULOUS SINCE AT THE TIME I HAD MY HEALTH AND LIMBS AND OTHER SERVANTS AND MIGHT
AS I WAS THAT I OUGHT INDEED TO SUBMIT TO IT AS A WORK OF HEAVEN IF I HAD BEEN ANY WAY DISABLED BY DISTEMPERS OR DISEASES AND THAT THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO GO
THAT IF I HAD BEEN A STRANGER AND AT A LOSS FOR MY WAY I MIGHT SOMETIMES HAVE GONE THE LENGTH OF A WHOLE STREET I MEAN OF THE BY STREETS AND SEEN NOBODY TO DIRECT ME
AND IN OTHER PLACES WHERE HE HAD BEEN FOR MY BROTHER BEING A MERCHANT WAS A FEW YEARS BEFORE AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED RETURNED FROM ABROAD COMING LAST FROM LISBON AND HOW
THAT WOULD SURROUND ME AND THAT IF I ATTEMPTED TO SECURE MYSELF BY FLEEING FROM MY HABITATION AND ACTED CONTRARY TO THESE INTIMATIONS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE DIVINE IT WAS A KIND OF
AT THE SAME TIME IN LONDON AND NOT MANY YEARS BEFORE COME OVER FROM PORTUGAL AND ADVISING WITH HIM HIS ANSWER WAS IN THREE WORDS
MY TRADE WAS A SADDLER AND AS MY DEALINGS WERE CHIEFLY NOT BY A SHOP OR CHANCE TRADE BUT AMONG THE MERCHANTS TRADING TO THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA SO MY EFFECTS LAY VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF SUCH
I SAY AS MANY DID BECAUSE SEVERAL DID SO AT LAST ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ARMIES IN THE WAR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MANY YEARS PAST AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT SPEAKING OF SECOND CAUSES
I OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIM WHO HAVING BEEN MY MAKER HAD AN UNDISPUTED RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN DISPOSING OF ME AND THAT THEN THERE HAD BEEN
A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
SWEATED A LITTLE AND WAS MUCH REFRESHED THE APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING THE INFECTION WENT ALSO QUITE AWAY WITH MY ILLNESS AND I WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS AS USUAL
AND HARDLY ANYTHING OF REFORMATION THOUGH THEY DID NOT WANT BEING TOLD THAT THEIR CRYING VICES MIGHT WITHOUT BREACH OF CHARITY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE FAR IN BRINGING THAT TERRIBLE JUDGEMENT UPON THE WHOLE NATION
FROM THE BEGINNING OF APRIL ESPECIALLY THEY STOOD AT TWENTY FIVE EACH WEEK TILL THE WEEK FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE TWENTY FIFTH
WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOUGH THEY WERE AT FIRST IN A MOST INEXPRESSIBLE CONSTERNATION YET AS I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE DISTEMPER INTERMITTED OFTEN AT FIRST SO THEY WERE AS IT WERE
I OBEYED THIS LAY CLOSE TO ME AND MY MIND SEEMED MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED TO STAY THAN EVER AND SUPPORTED WITH A SECRET SATISFACTION THAT I SHOULD BE KEPT ADD TO THIS THAT
AND SEVERAL COUNCILS WERE HELD ABOUT WAYS TO PREVENT ITS COMING OVER BUT ALL WAS KEPT VERY PRIVATE HENCE IT WAS THAT THIS RUMOUR DIED OFF AGAIN AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO FORGET IT AS A THING WE WERE VERY LITTLE CONCERNED IN
THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR THE PLAGUE WAS TO RUN AWAY FROM IT AS TO MY ARGUMENT OF LOSING MY TRADE MY GOODS OR DEBTS HE QUITE CONFUTED ME HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING WHICH
IRRESOLUTE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I HAD SET THE EVENING WHOLLY APART TO CONSIDER SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT AND WAS ALL ALONE FOR ALREADY PEOPLE HAD AS IT WERE BY A GENERAL CONSENT
NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALREADY INFECTED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MAY YET THE WEATHER WAS TEMPERATE VARIABLE AND COOL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE HAD STILL SOME HOPES THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED THEM WAS THAT THE CITY WAS HEALTHY
TO LONDON I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT AS JERUSALEM WAS BESIEGED BY THE ROMANS WHEN THE JEWS WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER BY WHICH MEANS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED THERE
I TOLD HIM THAT I INCLINED TO STAY AND TAKE MY LOT IN THAT STATION IN WHICH GOD HAD PLACED ME AND THAT IT SEEMED TO BE MADE MORE ESPECIALLY MY DUTY ON THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID
FLYING FROM GOD AND THAT HE COULD CAUSE HIS JUSTICE TO OVERTAKE ME WHEN AND WHERE HE THOUGHT FIT THESE THOUGHTS QUITE TURNED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN AND WHEN I CAME TO DISCOURSE WITH MY BROTHER AGAIN
IT WAS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT I AMONG THE REST OF MY NEIGHBOURS HEARD IN ORDINARY DISCOURSE THAT THE PLAGUE WAS RETURNED AGAIN IN HOLLAND
THE WOMAN BEING TAKEN ILL WITH WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO ENTRUST MY HOUSE AND ALL MY AFFAIRS
BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
FOR IF ANY ONE COMPLAINED IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SAID HE HAD THE PLAGUE
ABOUT THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BEING FROM HEAVEN I MENTION THIS STORY ALSO AS THE BEST METHOD I CAN ADVISE ANY PERSON TO TAKE IN SUCH A CASE ESPECIALLY IF HE BE ONE THAT MAKES CONSCIENCE OF HIS DUTY
SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
SAINT JAMES'S SEVEN
IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
COACHES FILLED WITH PEOPLE OF THE BETTER SORT AND HORSEMEN ATTENDING THEM AND ALL HURRYING AWAY THEN EMPTY WAGGONS AND CARTS APPEARED AND SPARE HORSES WITH SERVANTS WHO IT WAS APPARENT
THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
SAINT BRIDE'S SIX SAINT JAMES'S NINE
IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WRITTEN BY A CITIZEN WHO CONTINUED ALL THE WHILE IN LONDON NEVER MADE PUBLIC BEFORE
WHAT WAS MY DUTY TO DO AND I STATED THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH MY BROTHER HAD PRESSED ME TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND I SET AGAINST THEM THE STRONG IMPRESSIONS WHICH I HAD ON MY MIND FOR STAYING THE VISIBLE CALL I SEEMED TO HAVE
AND WOULD BE DIRECTED WHAT TO DO IN IT NAMELY THAT HE SHOULD KEEP HIS EYE UPON THE PARTICULAR PROVIDENCES WHICH OCCUR AT THAT TIME AND LOOK UPON THEM COMPLEXLY AS THEY REGARD ONE ANOTHER
CONCERNING MY OWN CASE AND HOW I SHOULD DISPOSE OF MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY WHETHER I SHOULD RESOLVE TO STAY IN LONDON OR SHUT UP MY HOUSE AND FLEE AS MANY OF MY NEIGHBOURS DID I HAVE SET THIS PARTICULAR DOWN
SO FULLY BECAUSE I KNOW NOT BUT IT MAY BE OF MOMENT TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER ME IF THEY COME TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SAME DISTRESS AND TO THE SAME MANNER OF MAKING THEIR CHOICE AND THEREFORE
IT WAS BROUGHT SOME SAID FROM ITALY OTHERS FROM THE LEVANT AMONG SOME GOODS WHICH WERE BROUGHT HOME BY THEIR TURKEY FLEET OTHERS SAID IT WAS BROUGHT FROM CANDIA OTHERS FROM CYPRUS
YET BEING VERY ILL BOTH IN MY HEAD AND IN MY STOMACH I WAS NOT WITHOUT APPREHENSION THAT I REALLY WAS INFECTED BUT IN ABOUT THREE DAYS I GREW BETTER THE THIRD NIGHT I RESTED WELL
ALL THE RUINED FAMILIES OF THE ROYAL PARTY FLOCKED HITHER ALL THE OLD SOLDIERS SET UP TRADES HERE AND ABUNDANCE OF FAMILIES SETTLED HERE AGAIN
AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
TWO PHYSICIANS AND A SURGEON WERE ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND MAKE INSPECTION THIS THEY DID AND FINDING EVIDENT TOKENS OF THE SICKNESS UPON BOTH THE BODIES THAT WERE DEAD
THAT ANY SHOULD HAVE HEARTS SO HARDENED IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A CALAMITY AS TO ROB AND STEAL YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT ALL SORTS OF VILLAINIES AND EVEN LEVITIES AND DEBAUCHERIES
AND IT WAS MEET HE SHOULD DO WITH ME AS SHOULD SEEM GOOD TO HIM WITH THIS RESOLUTION I WENT TO BED
SO THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM EXTRAORDINARY AND I OUGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT DID NOT EVIDENTLY POINT OUT OR INTIMATE TO ME THAT IT WAS THE WILL OF HEAVEN I SHOULD NOT GO
SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
AND AFTERWARDS FETCHED A ROUND FARTHER INTO BUCKINGHAMSHIRE OR BEDFORDSHIRE TO A RETREAT HE HAD FOUND OUT THERE FOR HIS FAMILY IT WAS A VERY ILL TIME TO BE SICK IN
ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT AS IT HAD GOTTEN SOME VENT IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE SECRETARIES OF STATE GOT KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND CONCERNING THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN OF THE TRUTH
FROM THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY CALLING AND THE CARE DUE FROM ME FOR THE PRESERVATION OF MY EFFECTS WHICH WERE AS I MIGHT SAY MY ESTATE ALSO THE INTIMATIONS WHICH I THOUGHT
AND AT THAT JUNCTURE I HAPPENED TO STOP TURNING OVER THE BOOK
YET THERE DIED NO MORE OF THE PLAGUE ON THE WHOLE SOUTHWARK SIDE OF THE WATER THAN SIXTEEN BUT THIS FACE OF THINGS SOON CHANGED
OF ALL DISTEMPERS WHEREOF IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DIED OF THE PLAGUE YET THERE WAS BUT TWENTY EIGHT IN THE WHOLE CITY WITHIN THE WALLS AND BUT NINETEEN IN SOUTHWARK
THIS HURRY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SUCH FOR SOME WEEKS THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DOOR WITHOUT EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SUCH PRESSING AND CROWDING THERE
WAS SUCH THAT THE TOWN WAS COMPUTED TO HAVE IN IT ABOVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN EVER IT HELD BEFORE NAY SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO SAY IT HAD TWICE AS MANY BECAUSE
AMONG THE WEALTHIEST OF THE PEOPLE AND SUCH PEOPLE AS WERE UNENCUMBERED WITH TRADES AND BUSINESS BUT OF THE REST THE GENERALITY STAYED AND SEEMED TO ABIDE THE WORST SO THAT
IN HIM WILL I TRUST SURELY HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND FROM THE NOISOME PESTILENCE HE SHALL COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS AND UNDER HIS WINGS SHALT THOU TRUST
SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
OR RATHER AT THE UPPER END OF DRURY LANE
IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AND THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN IN WHITECHAPPEL THAT IS TO SAY THE BROAD STREET WHERE I LIVED INDEED NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT WAGGONS AND CARTS WITH GOODS
FOR SAYS HE IS IT NOT AS REASONABLE THAT YOU SHOULD TRUST GOD WITH THE CHANCE OR RISK OF LOSING YOUR TRADE AS THAT YOU SHOULD STAY IN SO EMINENT A POINT OF DANGER AND TRUST HIM WITH YOUR LIFE I COULD NOT
AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE ORDINARY BURIALS INCREASED IN NUMBER CONSIDERABLY FOR EXAMPLE FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TO JANUARY THIRD
AS OTHERS RETIRED REALLY FRIGHTED WITH THE DISTEMPER IT WAS A MERE DESOLATING OF SOME OF THE STREETS BUT THE FRIGHT WAS NOT YET NEAR SO GREAT IN THE CITY ABSTRACTLY SO CALLED
MAGISTRATES AND SERVANTS LEFT IN THE CITY AS THEY FLED NOW OUT OF THE CITY SO I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT THE COURT REMOVED EARLY
I READ ON TO THE SEVENTH VERSE EXCLUSIVE AND AFTER THAT INCLUDED THE TENTH AS FOLLOWS I WILL SAY OF THE LORD HE IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS MY GOD
BUT THEY WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT STREET NEITHER ON ONE SIDE
BECAUSE THOU HAST MADE THE LORD WHICH IS MY REFUGE EVEN THE MOST HIGH THY HABITATION THERE SHALL NO EVIL BEFALL THEE NEITHER SHALL ANY PLAGUE COME NIGH THY DWELLING
AND OF THE LAST THE BILL ITSELF SAID
AND GOT THERE JUST AS THE DOCTOR RODE UP THERE WAS A WOMAN SITTING ON THE GROUND WITH THE LADY'S HEAD IN HER LAP THE DOCTOR POURED SOMETHING INTO HER MOUTH BUT ALL THAT I HEARD WAS SHE IS NOT DEAD THEN I WAS LED OFF BY A MAN
SO THAT WHEN SHE PUT THE CUP TO HER MOUTH IT WAS EMPTY AT THIS TOO THE YOUNGEST SISTER WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED BUT THE ELDEST ALWAYS SILENCED HER
AND I HAVE FOLLOWED THE HOUNDS A GREAT MANY TIMES THOUGH I KNOW YOU DO NOT APPROVE OF LADIES HUNTING BUT STILL THAT IS THE FACT AND I INTEND TO TRY THIS LIZZIE
AND NOT ANOTHER SIXPENCE YES OR NO DONE SAID THE SALESMAN AND YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THERE'S A MONSTROUS DEAL OF QUALITY IN THAT HORSE AND IF YOU WANT HIM FOR CAB WORK HE'S A BARGAIN
BUT MY PACE SOON CURED THAT DIFFICULTY AND HE FOUND THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO STICK TO THE SADDLE AND HOLD ME IN WHICH HE DID MANFULLY I SHOOK HIM AS LITTLE AS I COULD HELP BUT ONCE OR TWICE
I WAS PUT WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER STRONG USEFUL LOOKING HORSES AND A GOOD MANY PEOPLE CAME TO LOOK AT US THE GENTLEMEN ALWAYS TURNED FROM ME WHEN THEY SAW MY BROKEN KNEES
AS IF HE WAS FAST ASLEEP WHEN THE TWELVE PRINCESSES HEARD THIS THEY LAUGHED HEARTILY AND THE ELDEST SAID THIS FELLOW TOO MIGHT HAVE DONE A WISER THING THAN LOSE HIS LIFE IN THIS WAY
AGAIN AND AGAIN I NEIGHED PAWING THE GROUND IMPATIENTLY AND TOSSING MY HEAD TO GET THE REIN LOOSE I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BLANTYRE CAME RUNNING TO THE GATE HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ABOUT
AND GLITTERED AND SPARKLED BEAUTIFULLY THE SOLDIER WISHED TO TAKE AWAY SOME TOKEN OF THE PLACE SO HE BROKE OFF A LITTLE BRANCH AND THERE CAME A LOUD NOISE FROM THE TREE THEN THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SAID AGAIN
ORDERED HIS HEAD TO BE CUT OFF AFTER HIM CAME SEVERAL OTHERS
I AM NOT VERY YOUNG SO I WILL HAVE THE ELDEST AND THEY WERE MARRIED THAT VERY DAY
THEN HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON HIS BED AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
SOMETIMES WITH GINGER SOMETIMES WITH LIZZIE THIS LIZZIE WAS A BRIGHT BAY MARE ALMOST THOROUGHBRED AND A GREAT FAVORITE WITH THE GENTLEMEN ON ACCOUNT OF HER FINE ACTION AND LIVELY SPIRIT
WHILE OTHERS WOULD TAKE THEIR HANDS GENTLY OVER ONE'S BODY WITH A PAT NOW AND THEN AS MUCH AS TO SAY BY YOUR LEAVE OF COURSE I JUDGED A GOOD DEAL OF THE BUYERS BY THEIR MANNERS TO MYSELF
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN SHE CAME BACK I COULD SEE THAT SHE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH STRAINED AND NOW AND THEN SHE GAVE A SHORT COUGH SHE HAD TOO MUCH SPIRIT TO COMPLAIN BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
AND WHETHER IT WAS THE STUPID COLT OR THE LOUD CRACKING OF THE WHIP
ANOTHER BEND AND SHE WAS HIDDEN AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES WE CAUGHT GLIMPSES AND THEN LOST THEM WE SCARCELY SEEMED TO GAIN GROUND UPON THEM AT ALL AN OLD ROAD MENDER WAS STANDING NEAR A HEAP OF STONES
AND LOCKED UP BUT EVERY MORNING THEIR SHOES WERE FOUND TO BE QUITE WORN THROUGH AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DANCED IN ALL NIGHT AND YET NOBODY COULD FIND OUT HOW IT HAPPENED OR WHERE THEY HAD BEEN THEN THE KING MADE IT KNOWN TO ALL THE LAND
JUST THEN SOME CART HORSES AND SEVERAL YOUNG COLTS CAME TROTTING OUT IN A VERY DISORDERLY MANNER WHILE A BOY BEHIND WAS CRACKING A GREAT WHIP THE COLTS WERE WILD AND FROLICSOME
AND A GOOD MANY LIKE MYSELF HANDSOME AND HIGH BRED
THE LADY ANNE OR A RUNAWAY HORSE EARLY IN THE SPRING LORD W AND PART OF HIS FAMILY WENT UP TO LONDON AND TOOK YORK WITH THEM
TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT BLANTYRE PAID ME A VISIT HE PATTED ME AND PRAISED ME VERY MUCH HE TOLD LORD GEORGE THAT HE WAS SURE THE HORSE KNEW OF ANNIE'S DANGER AS WELL AS HE DID
JUST AS WE WERE MOVING OFF A FOOTMAN CAME OUT WITH A SLIP OF PAPER
THERE WAS NO SOUND GENTLY HE TURNED HER FACE UPWARD IT WAS GHASTLY WHITE AND THE EYES WERE CLOSED ANNIE DEAR ANNIE DO SPEAK BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER HE UNBUTTONED HER HABIT
I FOUND BY THEIR CONVERSATION THAT MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS NOW OUT OF DANGER AND WOULD SOON BE ABLE TO RIDE AGAIN
AND EVERY THING HAPPENED JUST AS BEFORE THE PRINCESSES DANCED EACH TIME TILL THEIR SHOES WERE WORN TO PIECES AND THEN RETURNED HOME HOWEVER ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE SOLDIER CARRIED AWAY ONE OF THE GOLDEN CUPS AS A TOKEN OF WHERE HE HAD BEEN
BUT GINGER WHO KNEW MORE OF HER THAN I DID TOLD ME SHE WAS RATHER NERVOUS
WITH LADY ANNE'S MAID AND HELP I SHALL STAY HERE ALL RIGHT SIR
TILL IN THE TWILIGHT WE REACHED THE GREAT CITY THE GAS LAMPS WERE ALREADY LIGHTED THERE WERE STREETS TO THE RIGHT AND STREETS TO THE LEFT AND STREETS CROSSING EACH OTHER FOR MILE UPON MILE I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER COME TO THE END OF THEM
SO THEY WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO A GREAT LAKE AND AT THE SIDE OF THE LAKE THERE LAY TWELVE LITTLE BOATS WITH TWELVE HANDSOME PRINCES IN THEM WHO SEEMED TO BE WAITING THERE FOR THE PRINCESSES ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WENT INTO EACH BOAT
AND THE HEAD GROOM WAS LEFT IN CHARGE THE LADY HARRIET WHO REMAINED AT THE HALL WAS A GREAT INVALID AND NEVER WENT OUT IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE LADY ANNE PREFERRED RIDING ON HORSEBACK WITH HER BROTHER OR COUSINS
BUT HE WALKED OFF ONE OR TWO MORE CAME WHO DID NOT MEAN BUSINESS THEN THE HARD FACED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN AND OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS A VERY CLOSE BARGAIN WAS BEING DRIVEN FOR MY SALESMAN
THERE HAD BEEN A WIDE DIKE RECENTLY CUT AND THE EARTH FROM THE CUTTING WAS CAST UP ROUGHLY ON THE OTHER SIDE SURELY THIS WOULD STOP THEM BUT NO WITH SCARCELY A PAUSE LIZZIE TOOK THE LEAP
BEGAN TO THINK HE SHOULD NOT GET ALL HE ASKED AND MUST COME DOWN BUT JUST THEN THE GRAY EYED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP REACHING OUT MY HEAD TOWARD HIM HE STROKED MY FACE KINDLY
AND JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE FLYING FIGURE NOW FAR AWAY ON THE ROAD IN AN INSTANT HE SPRANG TO THE SADDLE I NEEDED NO WHIP NO SPUR FOR I WAS AS EAGER AS MY RIDER
BUT WHOEVER TRIED AND DID NOT SUCCEED AFTER THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH A KING'S SON SOON CAME HE WAS WELL ENTERTAINED AND IN THE EVENING
THEN THEY ROSE UP AND OPENED THEIR DRAWERS AND BOXES AND TOOK OUT ALL THEIR FINE CLOTHES AND DRESSED THEMSELVES AT THE GLASS
AND THE SOLDIER BROKE A BRANCH FROM EACH AND EVERY TIME THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE WHICH MADE THE YOUNGEST SISTER TREMBLE WITH FEAR BUT THE ELDEST STILL SAID IT WAS ONLY THE PRINCES WHO WERE CRYING FOR JOY
NOW IT CHANCED THAT AN OLD SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN WOUNDED IN BATTLE AND COULD FIGHT NO LONGER PASSED THROUGH THE COUNTRY WHERE THIS KING REIGNED AND AS HE WAS TRAVELLING THROUGH A WOOD HE MET AN OLD WOMAN WHO ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING
LOOSENED HER COLLAR FELT HER HANDS AND WRIST THEN STARTED UP AND LOOKED WILDLY ROUND HIM FOR HELP AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE WERE TWO MEN CUTTING TURF WHO SEEING LIZZIE RUNNING WILD WITHOUT A RIDER
AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL MASH READY FOR ME SAUSAGE DUMPLING AND APPLE TURNOVER SHOUTED THE BOY WHICH SET THEM ALL LAUGHING I WAS LED INTO A COMFORTABLE CLEAN SMELLING STALL WITH PLENTY OF DRY STRAW
AND LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD WE DASHED AFTER THEM FOR ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF THE ROAD RAN STRAIGHT AND THEN BENT TO THE RIGHT AFTER WHICH IT DIVIDED INTO TWO ROADS
AND WHEN THE EVENING CAME HE WAS LED TO THE OUTER CHAMBER JUST AS HE WAS GOING TO LIE DOWN THE ELDEST OF THE PRINCESSES BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF WINE BUT THE SOLDIER THREW IT ALL AWAY SECRETLY TAKING CARE NOT TO DRINK A DROP
AND IF A HORSE MAY SPEAK HIS MIND SO FAR AS HE UNDERSTANDS I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE MORE LIES TOLD AND MORE TRICKERY AT THAT HORSE FAIR
HUMMING A LITTLE SONG I LISTENED TO MY RIDER'S FOOTSTEPS UNTIL THEY REACHED THE HOUSE AND HEARD HIM KNOCK AT THE DOOR THERE WAS A MEADOW ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE GATE OF WHICH STOOD OPEN
SHE WAS UNCOMMON GOOD TO MY WIFE IN THE WINTER THEN MOUNT THIS HORSE MY FRIEND YOUR NECK WILL BE QUITE SAFE AND RIDE TO THE DOCTOR'S AND ASK HIM TO COME INSTANTLY
THE ELDEST LEADING THE WAY AND THINKING HE HAD NO TIME TO LOSE HE JUMPED UP PUT ON THE CLOAK WHICH THE OLD WOMAN HAD GIVEN HIM AND FOLLOWED THEM BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAIRS HE TROD ON THE GOWN OF THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
AS SOON AS YOU PUT THAT ON YOU WILL BECOME INVISIBLE AND YOU WILL THEN BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE PRINCESSES WHEREVER THEY GO
I HARDLY KNOW WHERE I AM GOING OR WHAT I HAD BETTER DO SAID THE SOLDIER BUT I THINK I SHOULD LIKE VERY WELL TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCE AND THEN IN TIME I MIGHT BE A KING WELL SAID THE OLD DAME
OPEN THE GATES AND MOTHER WILL BRING US THE LANTERN THE NEXT MINUTE THEY WERE ALL STANDING ROUND ME IN A SMALL STABLE YARD IS HE GENTLE FATHER YES DOLLY AS GENTLE AS YOUR OWN KITTEN COME AND PAT HIM
WE DO NOT GET ON SO FAST AS USUAL AND I AM QUITE TIRED THE BOAT SEEMS VERY HEAVY TODAY IT IS ONLY THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER SAID THE PRINCESS I FEEL IT VERY WARM TOO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE STOOD A FINE ILLUMINATED CASTLE
MAY OPEN HER EYES SOON THEN SEEING THE OTHER MAN HE CALLED OUT HERE JOE RUN FOR SOME WATER AND TELL MY MISSIS
YOU SILLY CREATURE SAID THE ELDEST IT IS NOTHING BUT A NAIL IN THE WALL THEN DOWN THEY ALL WENT AND AT THE BOTTOM THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MOST DELIGHTFUL GROVE OF TREES AND THE LEAVES WERE ALL OF SILVER
IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE GINGER CAME BACK AND BEFORE WE WERE LEFT ALONE AND THEN SHE TOLD ME ALL THAT SHE HAD SEEN I CAN'T TELL MUCH SHE SAID WE WENT A GALLOP NEARLY ALL THE WAY
NO DOUBT A HORSE FAIR IS A VERY AMUSING PLACE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AT ANY RATE THERE IS PLENTY TO SEE
NO NO HE SAID I'LL BE BACK TO EM AGAIN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE FIELDS
LONG BEFORE WE CAME TO THE BEND SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH WAY HAD SHE TURNED A WOMAN WAS STANDING AT HER GARDEN GATE SHADING HER EYES WITH HER HAND AND LOOKING EAGERLY UP THE ROAD
THROUGH SOME ACCIDENT OR BLEMISH UNSOUNDNESS OF WIND OR SOME OTHER COMPLAINT THERE WERE SOME SPLENDID ANIMALS QUITE IN THEIR PRIME AND FIT FOR ANYTHING THEY WERE THROWING OUT THEIR LEGS AND SHOWING OFF THEIR PACES IN HIGH STYLE
WELL OLD CHAP HE SAID I THINK WE SHOULD SUIT EACH OTHER I'LL GIVE TWENTY FOUR FOR HIM SAY TWENTY FIVE AND YOU SHALL HAVE HIM TWENTY FOUR TEN SAID MY FRIEND IN A VERY DECIDED TONE
LONG STRINGS OF YOUNG HORSES OUT OF THE COUNTRY FRESH FROM THE MARSHES AND DROVES OF SHAGGY LITTLE WELSH PONIES NO HIGHER THAN MERRYLEGS AND HUNDREDS OF CART HORSES OF ALL SORTS
AS SOON AS THE TIME CAME WHEN HE WAS TO DECLARE THE SECRET HE WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE KING WITH THE THREE BRANCHES AND THE GOLDEN CUP AND THE TWELVE PRINCESSES STOOD LISTENING BEHIND THE DOOR TO HEAR WHAT HE WOULD SAY
THERE THEY ALL LANDED AND WENT INTO THE CASTLE AND EACH PRINCE DANCED WITH HIS PRINCESS AND THE SOLDIER WHO WAS ALL THE TIME INVISIBLE DANCED WITH THEM TOO AND WHEN ANY OF THE PRINCESSES HAD A CUP OF WINE SET BY HER HE DRANK IT ALL UP
AND I WILL TRY YOUR CHARMING LIZZIE YOU MUST CONFESS THAT IN SIZE AND APPEARANCE
TALKING TO HIMSELF AND TALKING TO ME HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO LONDON THROUGH PLEASANT LANES AND COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL WE CAME INTO THE GREAT LONDON THOROUGHFARE ON WHICH WE TRAVELED STEADILY
AND WHEN THE KING ASKED HIM WHERE DO MY TWELVE DAUGHTERS DANCE AT NIGHT HE ANSWERED WITH TWELVE PRINCES IN A CASTLE UNDER GROUND AND THEN HE TOLD THE KING ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHOWED HIM THE THREE BRANCHES AND THE GOLDEN CUP
THEN FEEL ALL THE WAY DOWN MY LEGS AND GIVE ME A HARD FEEL OF THE SKIN AND FLESH AND THEN TRY MY PACES IT WAS WONDERFUL WHAT A DIFFERENCE THERE WAS IN THE WAY THESE THINGS WERE DONE SOME DID IT IN A ROUGH OFFHAND WAY AS IF
NO SMELL OF OLD BEER AND TOBACCO WHICH I HATED BUT A FRESH SMELL AS IF HE HAD COME OUT OF A HAYLOFT HE OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS FOR ME BUT THAT WAS REFUSED AND HE WALKED AWAY
THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES THERE WAS A KING WHO HAD TWELVE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS THEY SLEPT IN TWELVE BEDS ALL IN ONE ROOM AND WHEN THEY WENT TO BED THE DOORS WERE SHUT
TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AFTER AWHILE SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE CARRIAGE AND WE CAME HOME TOGETHER I HEARD MY MASTER SAY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO STOPPED HIM TO INQUIRE THAT HE HOPED NO BONES WERE BROKEN BUT THAT SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN YET
HIS SHOVEL DROPPED AND HIS HANDS RAISED AS WE CAME NEAR HE MADE A SIGN TO SPEAK
THOUGH THE MAN WHO HAD ME SWORE IT WAS ONLY A SLIP IN THE STALL THE FIRST THING WAS TO PULL MY MOUTH OPEN
HE DETERMINED TO TRY HIS LUCK SO HE WENT TO THE KING AND SAID HE WAS WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK HE WAS AS WELL RECEIVED AS THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AND THE KING ORDERED FINE ROYAL ROBES TO BE GIVEN HIM
WE HAD HARDLY TURNED ON THE COMMON WHEN WE CAUGHT SIGHT AGAIN OF THE GREEN HABIT FLYING ON BEFORE US MY LADY'S HAT WAS GONE AND HER LONG BROWN HAIR WAS STREAMING BEHIND HER HER HEAD AND BODY WERE THROWN BACK
SCARCELY DRAWING THE REIN BLANTYRE SHOUTED WHICH WAY TO THE RIGHT CRIED THE WOMAN POINTING WITH HER HAND AND AWAY WE WENT UP THE RIGHT HAND ROAD THEN FOR A MOMENT WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER
AND QUICK IN ALL HIS MOTIONS I KNEW IN A MOMENT BY THE WAY HE HANDLED ME THAT HE WAS USED TO HORSES HE SPOKE GENTLY AND HIS GRAY EYE HAD A KINDLY CHEERY LOOK IN IT IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO SAY
AND SHE CRIED OUT TO HER SISTERS ALL IS NOT RIGHT
AND WAS SOON HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES LIZZIE WAS STANDING QUIETLY BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A FEW PACES OFF WITH HER BACK TO ME MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS SITTING EASILY WITH A LOOSE REIN
BUT NOW WITH A LIGHT HAND AND A PRACTICED EYE HE GUIDED ME OVER THE GROUND IN SUCH A MASTERLY MANNER THAT MY PACE WAS SCARCELY SLACKENED AND WE WERE DECIDEDLY GAINING ON THEM
STEADY WOAH STEADY ON THE HIGHROAD WE WERE ALL RIGHT AND AT THE DOCTOR'S AND THE HALL HE DID HIS ERRAND LIKE A GOOD MAN AND TRUE THEY ASKED HIM IN TO TAKE A DROP OF SOMETHING
BUT THE KING'S SON SOON FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE IN THE MORNING HE FOUND THAT THE PRINCESSES HAD ALL BEEN DANCING FOR THE SOLES OF THEIR SHOES WERE FULL OF HOLES THE SAME THING HAPPENED THE SECOND AND THIRD NIGHT SO THE KING
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW MANY KINGS SONS HAVE ALREADY WATCHED IN VAIN AND AS FOR THIS SOLDIER EVEN IF I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM HIS SLEEPING DRAUGHT
BUT SHE GAVE A VIOLENT KICK AND DASHED OFF INTO A HEADLONG GALLOP IT WAS SO SUDDEN THAT LADY ANNE WAS NEARLY UNSEATED BUT SHE SOON RECOVERED HERSELF I GAVE A LOUD SHRILL NEIGH FOR HELP
AND WITH ONE DETERMINED LEAP CLEARED BOTH DIKE AND BANK MOTIONLESS AMONG THE HEATHER WITH HER FACE TO THE EARTH
HE THEN SOMEHOW SCRAMBLED INTO THE SADDLE AND WITH A GEE UP AND A CLAP ON MY SIDES WITH BOTH HIS LEGS HE STARTED ON HIS JOURNEY MAKING A LITTLE CIRCUIT TO AVOID THE DIKE HE HAD NO WHIP WHICH SEEMED TO TROUBLE HIM
HAD LEFT THEIR WORK TO CATCH HER BLANTYRE'S HALLOO SOON BROUGHT THEM TO THE SPOT THE FOREMOST MAN SEEMED MUCH TROUBLED AT THE SIGHT AND ASKED WHAT HE COULD DO CAN YOU RIDE
AND THE SOLDIER STEPPED INTO THE SAME BOAT WITH THE YOUNGEST AS THEY WERE ROWING OVER THE LAKE THE PRINCE WHO WAS IN THE BOAT WITH THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS AND THE SOLDIER SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT IS BUT THOUGH I AM ROWING WITH ALL MY MIGHT
STAYING AT THE HALL HE ALWAYS RODE LIZZIE AND PRAISED HER SO MUCH THAT ONE DAY LADY ANNE ORDERED THE SIDE SADDLE TO BE PUT ON HER AND THE OTHER SADDLE ON ME WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR THE GENTLEMAN SEEMED VERY UNEASY
THEY CONFESSED IT ALL AND THE KING ASKED THE SOLDIER
ONLY TAKE CARE NOT TO DRINK ANY OF THE WINE WHICH ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WILL BRING TO YOU IN THE EVENING AND AS SOON AS SHE LEAVES YOU PRETEND TO BE FAST ASLEEP THEN SHE GAVE HIM A CLOAK AND SAID
THE MONEY WAS PAID ON THE SPOT AND MY NEW MASTER TOOK MY HALTER AND LED ME OUT OF THE FAIR TO AN INN WHERE HE HAD A SADDLE AND BRIDLE READY HE GAVE ME A GOOD FEED OF OATS AND STOOD BY WHILE I ATE IT
I WISH YOU LUCK WITH HIM THANK YOU GOVERNOR AND HE RODE ON WE SOON TURNED UP ONE OF THE SIDE STREETS AND ABOUT HALFWAY UP THAT WE TURNED INTO A VERY NARROW STREET WITH RATHER POOR LOOKING HOUSES ON ONE SIDE
BUT THE YOUNGEST SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS WHILE YOU ARE SO HAPPY I FEEL VERY UNEASY I AM SURE SOME MISCHANCE WILL BEFALL US YOU SIMPLETON SAID THE ELDEST YOU ARE ALWAYS AFRAID
AND SOME WITH OLD SORES ON THEIR BACKS AND HIPS THESE WERE SAD SIGHTS FOR A HORSE TO LOOK UPON WHO KNOWS NOT BUT HE MAY COME TO THE SAME STATE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF BARGAINING OF RUNNING UP AND BEATING DOWN
THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE WERE TAKEN OFF AND A CLOTH THROWN OVER ME GINGER WAS SADDLED AND SENT OFF IN GREAT HASTE FOR LORD GEORGE AND I SOON HEARD THE CARRIAGE ROLL OUT OF THE YARD
HOW IS THIS HE SAID ARE YOU TIRED OF YOUR GOOD BLACK AUSTER OH NO NOT AT ALL SHE REPLIED BUT I AM AMIABLE ENOUGH TO LET YOU RIDE HIM FOR ONCE
THE SOLDIER PLACED HIMSELF IN THE BOAT WITH THE ELDEST PRINCESS AND ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE THEY TOOK LEAVE OF EACH OTHER THE PRINCESSES PROMISING TO COME AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT
THERE WERE ALSO OPEN SPACES OF FINE SHORT GRASS WITH ANT HILLS AND MOLE TURNS EVERYWHERE
AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE COACH HOUSES AND STABLES ON THE OTHER MY OWNER PULLED UP AT ONE OF THE HOUSES AND WHISTLED THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE GIRL AND BOY RAN OUT
WAS TAKEN TO THE CHAMBER NEXT TO THE ONE WHERE THE PRINCESSES LAY IN THEIR TWELVE BEDS THERE HE WAS TO SIT AND WATCH WHERE THEY WENT TO DANCE AND IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT PASS WITHOUT HIS HEARING IT THE DOOR OF HIS CHAMBER WAS LEFT OPEN
SHE WAS A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN AND AS GAY AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL SHE CHOSE ME FOR HER HORSE AND NAMED ME BLACK AUSTER I ENJOYED THESE RIDES VERY MUCH IN THE CLEAR COLD AIR
WHEN LORD GEORGE TOOK GINGER FOR HUNTING YORK SHOOK HIS HEAD HE SAID IT OUGHT TO BE A STEADY HAND TO TRAIN A HORSE FOR THE FIRST SEASON AND NOT A RANDOM RIDER LIKE LORD GEORGE GINGER USED TO LIKE IT VERY MUCH
AT ONCE THE LITTLE HAND WAS PATTING ABOUT ALL OVER MY SHOULDER WITHOUT FEAR HOW GOOD IT FELT LET ME GET HIM A BRAN MASH WHILE YOU RUB HIM DOWN SAID THE MOTHER DO POLLY IT'S JUST WHAT HE WANTS
AS THEY WERE TROTTED OUT WITH A LEADING REIN THE GROOM RUNNING BY THE SIDE BUT ROUND IN THE BACKGROUND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF POOR THINGS SADLY BROKEN DOWN WITH HARD WORK WITH THEIR KNEES KNUCKLING OVER
BUT THE ELDEST SAID IT IS ONLY OUR PRINCES WHO ARE SHOUTING FOR JOY AT OUR APPROACH THEN THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GROVE OF TREES WHERE ALL THE LEAVES WERE OF GOLD AND AFTERWARDS TO A THIRD WHERE THE LEAVES WERE ALL GLITTERING DIAMONDS
AT LAST IN PASSING THROUGH ONE WE CAME TO A LONG CAB STAND WHEN MY RIDER CALLED OUT IN A CHEERY VOICE GOOD NIGHT GOVERNOR HALLOO CRIED A VOICE HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD ONE I THINK SO REPLIED MY OWNER
TILL WE CAME TO HIS GATE THERE WAS A SHORT DRIVE UP TO THE HOUSE BETWEEN TALL EVERGREENS BLANTYRE ALIGHTED AT THE GATE AND WAS GOING TO OPEN IT FOR LADY ANNE BUT SHE SAID I WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE
THERE WAS ONE MAN I THOUGHT IF HE WOULD BUY ME I SHOULD BE HAPPY HE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN NOR YET ONE OF THE LOUD FLASHY SORT THAT CALL THEMSELVES SO HE WAS RATHER A SMALL MAN BUT WELL MADE
THAT IF ANY PERSON COULD DISCOVER THE SECRET AND FIND OUT WHERE IT WAS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCED IN THE NIGHT HE SHOULD HAVE THE ONE HE LIKED BEST FOR HIS WIFE AND SHOULD BE KING AFTER HIS DEATH
NOW ALL IS QUITE SAFE THEN THEY UNDRESSED THEMSELVES PUT AWAY THEIR FINE CLOTHES PULLED OFF THEIR SHOES AND WENT TO BED IN THE MORNING THE SOLDIER SAID NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE STAIRS THE SOLDIER RAN ON BEFORE THE PRINCESSES AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND AS THE TWELVE SISTERS SLOWLY CAME UP VERY MUCH TIRED THEY HEARD HIM SNORING IN HIS BED SO THEY SAID
SO PLEASE HELP ME TO MOUNT LIKE A GOOD FRIEND AS YOU ARE THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE SAID HE PLACED HER CAREFULLY ON THE SADDLE LOOKED TO THE BIT AND CURB GAVE THE REINS GENTLY INTO HER HAND AND THEN MOUNTED ME
AND THERE WERE SOME VERY DEJECTED LOOKING OLD HORSES WITH THE UNDER LIP HANGING DOWN AND THE EARS LYING BACK HEAVILY AS IF THERE WERE NO MORE PLEASURE IN LIFE AND NO MORE HOPE THERE WERE SOME SO THIN YOU MIGHT SEE ALL THEIR RIBS
WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN THE KING CALLED FOR THE PRINCESSES AND ASKED THEM WHETHER WHAT THE SOLDIER SAID WAS TRUE AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY WERE DISCOVERED
LET ME BEG YOU TO HAVE THE SADDLES CHANGED MY DEAR COUSIN SAID LADY ANNE LAUGHING PRAY DO NOT TROUBLE YOUR GOOD CAREFUL HEAD ABOUT ME I HAVE BEEN A HORSEWOMAN EVER SINCE I WAS A BABY
WOULD THEY ASK THIS QUESTION FOR HER AT DOCTOR ASHLEY'S AND BRING THE ANSWER THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT A MILE OFF AND THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE WAS THE LAST IN IT WE WENT ALONG GAYLY ENOUGH
TO THE COMMON TO THE COMMON SIR SHE HAS TURNED OFF THERE I KNEW THIS COMMON VERY WELL IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART VERY UNEVEN GROUND COVERED WITH HEATHER AND DARK GREEN FURZE BUSHES
THE BARGAIN HUNT WAS UP AND ANNA SOON YIELDED TO ITS MILD SATISFACTIONS IN THE MATTER OF HER TROUSSEAU AND THE HOUSE LINEN ANNA HAVING OBTAINED THE NEEDED MONEY AT SO DEAR A COST
AND THAT DAY IN GOING THROUGH THE ACCOUNTS HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT A SUM OF FIFTY POUNDS WAS MISSING IT'S A DREADFUL THING FOR WILLIE IF IT GETS ABOUT HE SAID A TALE OF THAT SORT WOULD FOLLOW HIM TO AUSTRALIA
FATHER IT ISN'T HER VOICE BROKE BUT ONLY FOR AN INSTANT I'M ASKING YOU FOR MY OWN MONEY YOU SEEM TO WANT TO MAKE ME MISERABLE JUST BEFORE MY WEDDING I WISH TO GOD THOU DST NEVER SEEN HENRY MYNORS
HAVE YOU HEARD HE ASKED SIMPLY ABOUT WHAT SHE WHISPERED ABOUT MY POOR OLD FATHER YES I WAS HOPING HOPING YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW
HE AT ANY RATE MUST KNOW AND PERHAPS THE STEWARDS BUT YOU CAN URGE THEM TO SAY NOTHING TELL THEM THAT YOU WILL MAKE IT GOOD I WILL WRITE A CHEQUE AT ONCE
JUST THEN BEATRICE ENTERED THE ROOM BEATRICE
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT MY FATHER IF I HAD TO HEAR IT I'D SOONER HAVE HEARD IT FROM YOU YOU MUST TRY TO FORGET IT SHE URGED HIM YOU ARE NOT YOUR FATHER
SHE HAD NEVER LOVED HER THOUGHTS OFTEN DWELT LOVINGLY ON WILLIE PRICE WHOM SHE DEEMED TO BE PURSUING IN AUSTRALIA AN HONOURABLE AND SUCCESSFUL CAREER QUICKENED AT THE OUTSET BY HER HUNDRED POUNDS
RAIN HAD FALLEN AND MORE WAS TO FALL A DOOR OPENED HIGHER UP THE STREET AND WILLIE PRICE CAME OUT CARRYING A SMALL BAG HE TURNED TO SPEAK TO SOME PERSON WITHIN THE HOUSE
BUT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS SHE HURRIED BACK BREATHLESS TO HER PLACE SEE THAT ANNA IT WILL BE RECKONED IN OUR RETURNS SHE SAID EXHIBITING A PIECE OF PAPER
HE HAD NOT EXPECTED MORE THAN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS AND EVEN THIS SUM HAD DAZZLED HIS IMAGINATION HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD ONLY TAKEN THE HOUSE AT TOFT END ON A YEARLY TENANCY
THAT WILLIE A SELF CONVICTED FORGER HAD BEEN A PARTY TO THE EMBEZZLEMENT BUT ANNA KNEW THAT IT COULD NOT BE SO
NOTHING ELSE WAS POSSIBLE SHE WHO HAD NEVER FAILED IN DUTY DID NOT FAIL THEN SHE WHO HAD ALWAYS SUBMITTED AND BOWED THE HEAD SUBMITTED AND BOWED THE HEAD THEN
I CAN'T ALTER THE ACCOUNTS AT LEAST I CAN'T ALTER THE BANK BOOK AND THE VOUCHERS THE AUDITOR WOULD DETECT IT IN A MINUTE BESIDES I SHOULD NOT BE DOING MY DUTY IF I KEPT A THING LIKE THIS FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT MINISTER
THE FIRST INTOXICATION HAVING PASSED HE MADE NO FURTHER REFERENCE OF ANY KIND TO ANNA'S FORTUNE THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEIR MARRIED LIFE WERE PLANNED ON A SCALE WHICH IGNORED THE FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS
THIS VISION OF HIM WAS HER STAY
IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE MISS DICKINSON TOLD ME YOU WILL BE GLAD TO KNOW LADIES MYNORS VOICE SANG OUT FROM THE PLATFORM THAT THE TOTAL PROCEEDS SO FAR AS WE CAN CALCULATE THEM NOW
I'VE GOT A NOTE HERE FOR YOU SHE SAID I SHOULD HAVE POSTED IT TO THE STEAMER BUT NOW YOU CAN TAKE IT YOURSELF I WANT YOU NOT TO READ IT TILL YOU GET TO MELBOURNE
AND THEN STEPPED FORWARD AS HE PASSED ANNA SHE SPRANG FORTH
AS SOON AS A GIRL PASSED HER FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY SHE BEGAN TO SEW FOR THE BOTTOM DRAWER BUT ALL THOSE THINGS CHANGE SO I DARE SAY IT'S DIFFERENT NOW HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO BUY EVERYTHING DO YOU THINK ANNA ASKED
BY A COMMON IMPULSE THEY WENT INTO THE GARDEN OF THE PRIORY AND HE SHUT THE DOOR NEVER KNOW HE REPEATED OH THEY TOOK CARE TO TELL ME
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ANNA SAID BEATRICE WHEN AFTER ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE BAZAAR WAS CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC AND THE STALL HOLDERS AND THEIR ASSISTANTS WERE PREPARING TO DEPART THEIR MOVEMENTS HASTENED BY THE STERN ASPECT
HE PAID THE MONEY AND REQUESTED ANNA TO KEEP THE PLATE FOR HIM AT NINE O'CLOCK IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THOUGH RAFFLING WAS FORBIDDEN THE BAZAAR WOULD BE ENLIVENED BY AN AUCTION A LICENSED AUCTIONEER WAS BROUGHT
COULD LONG REMAIN A SECRET THE BAZAAR WAS A TRIUMPHANT AND UNPARALLELED SUCCESS AND OF THE SEVEN STALLS THE SUNDAY SCHOOL STALL STOOD FIRST EACH NIGHT IN THE NIGHTLY RETURNS THE SCENE IN THE TOWN HALL
CAN YOU BE READY BY THAT TIME YES SAID MISSUS SUTTON BUT POSSIBLY YOU'VE BEEN GETTING FORWARD WITH THEM ON THE QUIET TELL ME SAID ANNA WITH AN AIR OF INTEREST I'VE MEANT TO ASK YOU BEFORE
HE DID NOT PRECISELY ANTICIPATE TROUBLE BUT THE FACT HAD NOT ESCAPED HIM
THOU MEANS IT BUT YOU NEEDN'T GIVE IT ME ALL AT ONCE SHE PURSUED HE GAZED AT HER GLOWERING I SHANNA GIVE IT THEE
IS THE RICHER BY A HUNDRED POUNDS UNCLAIMED AND THE WORLD THE POORER BY A SIMPLE AND MEEK SOUL STUNG TO REVOLT
DRAW ME A CHEQUE FOR TWENTY POUNDS SHE SAID AND THEN WHILE HE WROTE HENRY AFTER WE'RE MARRIED I SHALL WANT YOU TO TAKE CHARGE OF ALL THIS YES OF COURSE I WILL DO THAT DEAR BUT YOUR MONEY WILL BE YOURS
NO WORD NO ACCENT TO RECALL THE TERRIBLE BUT SUBLIME PAST I DO SHE ANSWERED THEY SHOOK HANDS OTHERS APPROACHING HE DRIFTED AWAY HER GLANCE FOLLOWED HIM
AT NIGHTS WHEN SHE HAD LEISURE TO THINK ANNA WAS ASTONISHED HOW DURING THE DAY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER PREOCCUPATIONS
HE SEEMED QUITE CHEERFUL AS HE WALKED ABOUT WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS CHATTING WITH THIS ONE AND THAT
BUT WHICH THIS REVELATION OF VAST WEALTH HAD DIMINISHED TO A TRIFLE TITUS PRICE HAD BEEN THE TREASURER OF THE BUILDING FUND WHICH THE BAZAAR WAS DESIGNED TO ASSIST MYNORS HAD ASSUMED THE POSITION OF THE DEAD MAN
THE NEXT EVENING HENRY CAME UP SHE OBSERVED THAT HIS FACE HAD A GRAVE LOOK BUT INTENT ON HER OWN DIFFICULTIES SHE DID NOT REMARK ON IT AND PROCEEDED AT ONCE TO DO WHAT SHE RESOLVED TO DO
THE NEXT MORNING AT HALF PAST SEVEN ANNA WAS STANDING IN THE GARDEN DOORWAY OF THE PRIORY THE SUN HAD JUST RISEN THE AIR WAS COLD ROOF AND PAVEMENT WERE DAMP
SELF SCORNING WAS OF A PIECE WITH HER LIFE HE HASN'T REALLY GONE HE HASN'T REALLY GONE SHE KEPT REPEATING AND YET KNEW WELL THAT HE HAD GONE
IS IT THE BRIDE'S PLACE TO PROVIDE ALL THE HOUSE LINEN AND THAT SORT OF THING IT WAS IN MY DAY BUT THOSE THINGS ALTER SO THE BRIDE TOOK ALL THE HOUSE LINEN TO HER HUSBAND AND AS MANY CLOTHES FOR HERSELF
HENRY'S FACE BROKE INTO A LAUGH AND ANNA WAS OBLIGED TO SMILE CAPITAL HE SAID COULDN'T BE BETTER I WANT YOU TO TELL ME HOW MUCH I'VE GOT IN THE BANK SHE SAID
I HAD JUST COME UP HERE TO SEE IF THE WORKMEN HAD LOCKED UP PROPERLY WE HAVE SOME OF OUR NEW FURNITURE IN THE HOUSE YOU KNOW SHE WAS AS RED AS THE SUN OVER HILLPORT HE GLANCED AT HER
AND SHE HEARD HIM STRIKE A MATCH IN HIS OFFICE PRESENTLY HE RETURNED AND THREW ANGRILY ON TO THE TABLE IN FRONT OF HER A CHEQUE BOOK AND PASS BOOK THE DEPOSIT BOOK SHE HAD ALWAYS KEPT HERSELF FOR CONVENIENCE OF PAYING INTO THE BANK
DRAPED AND FRILLED AND FLORIATED AND STILL LADEN WITH COUNTLESS ARTICLES OF USE AND ORNAMENT WERE CONTINUALLY REINFORCED WITH PURCHASERS BY EMISSARIES CANVASSING THE CROWD
BUT YOU MUST TAKE THAT TO THE FLOWER STALL MY PET SAID MISSUS SUTTON CAN'T I GIVE IT TO YOU THE CHILD PLEADED I WANT YOUR STALL TO BE THE BEST MYNORS ARRIVED NEXT
I'VE HAD A DIFFICULTY WITH FATHER AND I MUST TELL YOU NOT ABOUT THE WEDDING I HOPE HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT MONEY OF COURSE HENRY I CAN'T GET MARRIED WITHOUT A LOT OF MONEY WHY NOT HE INQUIRED
THAT PRECEDES A FINAL SEPARATION AS SOON AS HE SAW ANNA HE CAME TOWARDS HER WELL GOOD BYE MISS TELLWRIGHT HE SAID JAUNTILY I LEAVE FOR LIVERPOOL TO MORROW MORNING WISH ME LUCK NOTHING MORE
ORGANISER OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL STALL PRESSED ALL HER FRIENDS INTO THE SERVICE AND A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE DEATH OF SARAH VODREY ANNA AND EVEN AGNES GAVE MUCH OF THEIR SPARE TIME TO THE WORK
LINEN FOR IT'S NONE THY PLACE FOR BUY THAT YES FATHER IT IS
AS WOULD LAST A YEAR THAT WAS THE RULE WE USED TO STITCH EVERYTHING AT HOME IN THOSE DAYS EVERYTHING AND WE HAD WHAT WE CALLED A BOTTOM DRAWER TO STORE THEM IN
WHICH FILLED THE MIDDLE OF THE PAPER STREWN FLOOR THE HORSE WAS NOT ONLY TAKEN TO THE WATER BUT COMPELLED TO DRINK AND MANY A MAN WHO OUTSIDE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT THE RISK OF BEING ROBBED WAS ROBBED OPENLY
PERCEIVING THE DANGER LEAPED TO THE PLATFORM AND MASTERFULLY ASSUMED THE HAMMER MYNORS SURPASSED HIMSELF IN THE KIND OF WIT THAT AMUSES AN EXCITED CROWD
I WISH I HAD NEVER BEEN BORN HE SAID I WISH I'D GONE TO PRISON NOW WAS THE MOMENT WHEN IF EVER THE MOTHER'S INFLUENCE SHOULD BE EXERTED BE A MAN SHE SAID SOFTLY
THAT EVERY ARTICLE SHOULD BE BOUGHT READY MADE AND SEAMED AND THAT THE FIRST WEEK OF THE NEW YEAR IF INDEED MISSUS SUTTON SURVIVED THE BAZAAR SHOULD BE ENTIRELY AND ABSOLUTELY DEVOTED TO ANNA'S BUSINESS
A SILENCE FOLLOWED IS THAT YOUR LUGGAGE SHE INQUIRED HE LIFTED UP THE HANDBAG AND NODDED ALL OF IT YES HE SAID I'M ONLY AN EMIGRANT
IT WAS A COLD NIGHT IN NOVEMBER YET THE MISER WRATHFULLY SULLEN CHOSE TO SIT IN HIS OFFICE WITHOUT A FIRE AGNES WAS WORKING SUMS IN THE KITCHEN HENRY ANNA BEGAN
OH HENRY IT IS SHE EXCLAIMED SORROW STRICKEN BUT WE MUSTN'T LET IT GET ABOUT LET US PAY THE MONEY OURSELVES YOU MUST ENTER IT IN THE BOOKS AND SAY NOTHING THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID FIRMLY
MISSUS SUTTON AT SEVEN O'CLOCK HAD NOT RETURNED FROM TEA AND ANNA AND BEATRICE WHO MANAGED THE SUNDAY SCHOOL STALL IN HER ABSENCE FEARED THAT SHE HAD AT LAST SUCCUMBED UNDER THE STRAIN
NONSENSE BEE I DARE SAY YOU COULD DO IT ON A HUNDRED WITH CARE ANNA
THE MISERABLE ROBBERY OF SARAH'S WAGES WAS BURIED FOR EVERMORE AND THIS NEW DELINQUENCY WHICH ALL WOULD REGARD AS FLAGRANT SACRILEGE MUST BE BURIED ALSO A SOUL LESS LOYAL THAN ANNA'S MIGHT HAVE FEARED
TWO HUNDRED POUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF FURNITURE FOR THE PRIORY A MODEST SUM BUT HE JUDGED IT SUFFICIENT HIS METHOD WAS TO BUY A PIECE AT A TIME ALWAYS SECOND HAND BUT ALWAYS GOOD
I'VE MY OWN THINGS TO GET SHE SAID AND I'VE ALL THE HOUSE LINEN TO BUY OH YOU BUY THE HOUSE LINEN DO YOU SHE SAW THAT HE WAS RELIEVED BY THAT INFORMATION OF COURSE
EXCEED FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POUNDS THERE WAS CLAPPING OF HANDS WHICH DIED OUT SUDDENLY NOW AGNES ANNA CALLED COME ALONG QUICK YOU'RE AS WHITE AS A SHEET
SHAMELESSLY UNDER THE GAZE OF MINISTERS AND CLASS LEADERS BOUQUETS WERE SOLD AT A SHILLING EACH AND AT THE REFRESHMENT STALL A GLASS OF MILK COST SIXPENCE THE NOISE RIVALLED THAT OF A FAIR
WHAT BUSINESS AN YE FOR GO BLABBING THY AFFAIRS ALL OVER BOSLEY I SAY IT ISNA THY PLACE FOR BUY LINEN
WELL SHE LAUGHED WHAT WILL YOU GIVE
TO THE STATION SOME MAY ARGUE THAT ANNA KNOWING SHE LOVED ANOTHER MAN
HE NOW SAW HIMSELF THE DOMINANT FIGURE IN ALL THE FIVE TOWNS LATER IN THE EVENING HE DISCLOSED PERFUNCTORILY THE MATTER WHICH HAD BEEN A SERIOUS WEIGHT ON HIS MIND WHEN HE ENTERED THE HOUSE
FACING THE FUTURE CALMLY AND GENIALLY SHE TOOK OATH WITH HERSELF TO BE A GOOD WIFE TO THE MAN WHOM
SO THAT THERE SHOULDN'T BE A SCANDAL JUST FANCY DO YOU BELIEVE IT THE SECRET WAS ABROAD SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM AND SAW IT IN EVERY FACE
THERE OUGHT TO BE A SETTLEMENT ON YOU STILL IF YOUR FATHER SAYS NOTHING IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING FATHER WILL SAY NOTHING NOW SHE SAID YOU'VE NEVER SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN IT HENRY
GOOD NIGHT MISSUS SUTTON GOOD NIGHT BEE
ANNA BLUSHED RECOGNISING THE PLATE WHICH SHE HAD PAINTED THAT AFTERNOON IN JULY
IF YOU LIKE HE URGED SMILING FAINTLY AT HER EAGERNESS THE THING IS BOUND TO BE KEPT QUIET IT WOULD CREATE SUCH A FRIGHTFUL SCANDAL POOR OLD CHAP HE ADDED CARELESSLY
HE QUESTIONED SAVAGELY I MUST BUY THINGS FOR THE WEDDING CLOTHES AND THINGS FATHER AY CLOTHES CLOTHES WHAT CLOTHES DOST WANT A FEW POUNDS WILL COVER THEM THERE'LL BE ALL THE LINEN FOR THE HOUSE
HERE HE SAID SCORNFULLY TAK THY TRAPS AND NE'ER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN I WASH MY HANDS OF YE TAK EM AND DO WHAT YE'N A MIND CHUCK THY MONEY
THE FIFTY THOUSAND DANCED A JIG IN HIS BRAIN THAT NIGHT ANNA WAS ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATING THE MISFORTUNE OF WILLIE PRICE SHE PRAYED WILDLY THAT HE MIGHT NEVER LEARN THE FULL DEPTH OF HIS FATHER'S FALL
THERE WAS NO QUIET ANYWHERE SAVE IN THE FARTHEST RECESS OF EACH STALL WHERE THE LADY IN SUPREME CHARGE OF IT LIKE A SPIDER IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS WEB WATCHED CUSTOMERS AND CASH BOX WITH EQUAL CUPIDITY
ANNA WHO HAD BEEN LEFT ALONE IN THE STALL FIRST NOTICED WILLIE PRICE IN THE ROOM HIS SHIP SAILED ON THE MONDAY BUT STEERAGE PASSENGERS HAD TO BE ABOARD ON SUNDAY AND HE WAS SAYING GOOD BYE TO A FEW ACQUAINTANCES
I HAD MEANT TO FIND THE FIFTY MYSELF HE SAID IT WAS A PEDDLING SUM TO HIM NOW
IT'S GIVEN THEE PRIDE AND MADE THEE UNDUTIFUL I'M ONLY ASKING YOU FOR MY OWN MONEY HER CALM INSISTENCE MADDENED HIM JUMPING UP FROM HIS CHAIR HE STAMPED OUT OF THE ROOM
ALWAYS THE HAND WITH WHICH HE TOUCHED HER ARM SHOOK LIKE AN OLD MAN'S HAND AS THEIR EYES MET IN AN INTENSE AND PAINFUL GAZE TO HER AT LEAST IT WAS REVEALED THAT THEY WERE LOVERS
I DID THE BEST I COULD FOR YOU I SHALL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU IN AUSTRALIA GETTING ON SHE PUT A HAND ON HIS SHOULDER YES SHE SAID AGAIN PASSIONATELY I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU
SHE HAS THE SECRET OF PERSUADING HIM THOUGHT ANNA WHY HAVE I NEVER FOUND IT THEN AGNES IN A NEW WHITE FROCK CAME UP WITH THREE SHILLINGS PROCEEDS OF BOUQUETS
LIKE A BENEFICENT INFLUENCE FOR THREE DAYS SHE HAD CARRIED IN HER POCKET
INTO HIS POCKET HE WAS NOT THINKING OF THE NOTE AT ALL
AND THE AUCTION SOON MONOPOLISED THE ATTENTION OF THE ROOM IT WAS ALWAYS AFTERWARDS REMEMBERED AS THE CROWNING SUCCESS OF THE BAZAAR THE INCREDIBLE MAN TOOK TEN POUNDS IN TWENTY MINUTES DURING THIS EPISODE
SURELY NOT HE PROTESTED FORMALLY THAT'S WHAT FATHER TOLD ME AND HE MADE ME READ A LIST OF SHARES AND SO ON
WELL I TOLD FATHER I MUST HAVE A HUNDRED POUNDS
INTENDING BY SOME DEVICE TO FORCE IT ON HIM AS A PARTING GIFT NOW THE LAST CHANCE WAS LOST AND SHE HAD NOT EVEN ATTEMPTED THIS DIFFICULT FEAT OF CHARITY SUCH FUTILITY SHE REFLECTED
OR ELSEWHERE EVER HEARD OF WILLIE PRICE AGAIN AND WELL MIGHT NONE HEAR THE ABANDONED PITSHAFT DOES NOT DELIVER UP ITS SECRET AND SO THE BANK OF ENGLAND
OF THE TOWN HALL KEEPER NO WHAT SAID ANNA AND IN THE SAME MOMENT GUESSED THEY SAY OLD TITUS PRICE EMBEZZLED FIFTY POUNDS FROM THE BUILDING FUND AND HENRY MADE IT UP PRIVATELY
GO AND GET DINNER IT'S NIGH ON TWELVE NOW THAT EVENING WHEN AGNES HAD GONE TO BED SHE RESUMED THE STRUGGLE FATHER I MUST HAVE THAT HUNDRED POUNDS I REALLY MUST I MEAN IT
THOU MEANS IT WHAT I MEAN I MUST HAVE A HUNDRED POUNDS
I SUPPOSE HE WAS HARD RUN AND MEANT TO PUT IT BACK AS THEY ALL DO MEAN BUT IT WAS USELESS FOR MYNORS TO AFFECT DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS OR MOURNFUL SYMPATHY WITH THE ERRORS OF A DEAD SINNER
WHAT HE HAD LEARNT IN THAT INSTANT CAN ONLY BE GUESSED FROM HIS NEXT ACTION ANNA RAN OUT OF THE GARDEN INTO THE STREET AND SO HOME NEVER LOOKING BEHIND TO SEE IF HE PURSUED HIS WAY
WITH SOMETHING CONCEALED IN TISSUE PAPER HE REMOVED THE PAPER AND SHOWED IN A FRAME OF CRIMSON PLUSH A COMMON WHITE PLATE DECORATED WITH A SIMPLE BAND AND LINE AND A MONOGRAM IN THE CENTRE
BUT SHE NEVER SLEPT WITHOUT THINKING OF WILLIE PRICE AND HOPING THAT NO FURTHER DISASTER MIGHT OVERTAKE HIM THE INCIDENT OF THE EMBEZZLED FIFTY POUNDS HAD BEEN CLOSED
THE WESLEYAN BAZAAR THE GREATEST UNDERTAKING OF ITS KIND EVER KNOWN IN BURSLEY GRADUALLY BECAME A CLOUD WHICH FILLED THE ENTIRE SOCIAL HORIZON MISSUS SUTTON
ANNA WENT STRAIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD TO HER FATHER AND ASKED HIM FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS OF HER OWN MONEY SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN TO HIM SAVE UNDER NECESSITY SINCE THE EVENING SPENT AT THE SUTTONS WHAT'S AFOOT NOW
WHICH WAS CARRIED ON UNDER PRESSURE INCREASING DAILY AS THE FINAL MOMENTS APPROACHED THIS WAS WELL FOR ANNA IN THAT IT DIVERTED HER THOUGHTS BY KEEPING HER ENERGIES FULLY ENGAGED ONE MORNING HOWEVER
VERY WELL HE SAID
AND THE HOUSE LINEN WHAT DO YOU SAY OH BEATRICE REPLIED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION A COUPLE OF HUNDRED AT LEAST MISSUS SUTTON READING ANNA'S FACE SMILED REASSURINGLY
I ONLY KNOW I'M ALWAYS PAYING IN ODD CHEQUES HE EXAMINED THE THREE BOOKS A VERY TIDY BIT HE SAID SOMETHING OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS SO YOU CAN DRAW CHEQUES AT YOUR EASE
HE HAD ACQUAINTED THE MINISTER WITH THE FACTS AND MISTER BANKS HAD DECIDED THAT THE TWO CIRCUIT STEWARDS MUST BE INFORMED BEYOND THESE THE SCANDALOUS SECRET WAS NOT TO GO BUT ANNA WONDERED WHETHER A SECRET SHARED BY FIVE PERSONS
I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR ALL THIS INDUSTRY BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING THAT AS YOU ARE TO BE MARRIED IN FEBRUARY YOU OUGHT TO BE PREPARING YOUR THINGS MY THINGS ANNA REPEATED IDLY AND THEN SHE REMEMBERED
THE PRICE OF ADMISSION HAD BEEN REDUCED TO THREEPENCE IN ORDER THAT THE ARTISAN MIGHT ENTER AND SPEND HIS WAGES IN AN EXCELLENT CAUSE THE SEVEN STALLS RANGED ROUND THE ROOM LIKE SO MANY BOWERS OF BEAUTY
AND THE SALE COMMENCED THE AUCTIONEER HOWEVER FAILED TO ATTUNE HIMSELF TO THE WILD SPIRIT OF THE HOUR AND HIS PROFESSIONAL EFFORTS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A FIASCO
FOUND YET ANOTHER OBSTACLE IN THE IMMINENT BAZAAR WHICH OCCUPIED MISSUS SUTTON AND BEATRICE SO COMPLETELY THAT THEY COULD NOT CONTRIVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO ASSIST HER IN SHOPPING IT WAS DECIDED BETWEEN THEM
THAT THERE WOULD BE AMPLE TIME AFTER THE WEDDING FOR THE EXECUTION OF HIS PURPOSES IN REGARD TO THAT FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS MEANWHILE HE TOLD ANNA THAT HE HAD SET ASIDE
ON THE FOURTH AND FINAL NIGHT A SATURDAY WAS AS DELIRIOUS AND GAY AS A CARNIVAL FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS HAD BEEN RAISED UP TO TEA TIME AND IT WAS THE IMPASSIONED DESIRE OF EVERYONE TO ACHIEVE FIVE HUNDRED
BUT AS WE'RE TALKING OF MONEY I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU THAT FATHER SAYS I'M WORTH FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS THE MAN OF BUSINESS WAS ASTONISHED AND ENRAPTURED BEYOND MEASURE HIS COUNTENANCE SHONE WITH DELIGHT
AND WHEN I STUCK TO HIM HE GOT ANGRY YOU KNOW HE CAN'T BEAR TO SEE MONEY SPENT AND AT LAST HE GET A LITTLE SAVAGE AND GAVE ME MY BANK BOOKS AND SAID HE'D HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH MY MONEY
IT OCCURRED TO MISSUS SUTTON TO REFLECT THAT ANNA AT SUCH A PERIOD OF LIFE SHOULD BE OTHERWISE EMPLOYED ANNA HAD CALLED AT THE SUTTONS TO DELIVER SOME FINISHED GARMENTS MY DEAR SHE SAID
SHE HAD SUCKED IN WITH HER MOTHER'S MILK THE PROFOUND TRUTH THAT A WOMAN'S LIFE IS ALWAYS A RENUNCIATION GREATER OR LESS HERS BY CHANCE WAS GREATER
PROMISED MONTHS AGO
BUT SHE DID NOT REASON THUS SUCH A NOTION NEVER EVEN OCCURRED TO HER
CAN YOU SELL THIS MYNORS ASKED MISSUS SUTTON I'LL TRY TO SAID MISSUS SUTTON DOUBTFULLY NOT IN THE SECRET WHAT'S IT MEANT FOR TRY TO SELL IT TO ME SAID MYNORS
HE WAS IN NO HURRY TO ENLARGE HIS BORDERS HE KNEW THAT THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN EVERY DAY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS IN EVERY YEAR AND THIRTY GOOD YEARS IN LIFE STILL LEFT TO HIM AND THEREFORE
AND THIS VERITY THE EPISTLE FURTHER CONFIRMED WITH ROWS OF FULL STOPS TO THE EXTENT OF NEARLY HALF A PAGE NEXT THERE FOLLOWED A FEW REFLECTIONS OF A CORRECTITUDE SO REMARKABLE THAT I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO QUOTE THEM WHAT
AS NEED HARDLY BE SAID THE REST OF THE LADIES HAD TAKEN UMBRAGE AT HIS BEHAVIOUR ONE OF THEM PURPOSELY STALKED PAST HIM TO INTIMATE TO HIM THE FACT AS WELL AS TO JOSTLE THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER AND LET THE FLYING END OF A SCARF FLICK HER FACE
SOME OF THEIR NUMBER HASTENED TO OCCUPY CHAIRS NEARER TO HIS POST OF VANTAGE IN FACT WHEN A CERTAIN DAME CHANCED TO HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO ANTICIPATE A HATED RIVAL IN THE RACE THERE VERY NEARLY ENSUED A MOST LAMENTABLE SCENE
WHICH TO MANY OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN DESIROUS OF DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING SEEMED A PECULIARLY HORRIBLE INSTANCE OF BRAZEN FACED AUDACITY SO DEEPLY DID CHICHIKOV BECOME PLUNGED IN CONVERSATION WITH HIS FAIR PURSUERS OR RATHER
AND HE NO LONGER SEES A SINGLE PERSON OR A SINGLE OBJECT IN HIS VICINITY IN THE SAME WAY DID CHICHIKOV SUDDENLY BECOME OBLIVIOUS TO THE SCENE AROUND HIM
WITH A SORT OF OPPRESSIVE EMPTINESS THE DEVIL TAKE THOSE WHO FIRST INVENTED BALLS WAS HIS REFLECTION WHO DERIVES ANY REAL PLEASURE FROM THEM IN THIS PROVINCE THERE EXIST WANT AND SCARCITY EVERYWHERE YET FOLK GO IN FOR BALLS
HOWEVER CHICHIKOV SLIPPED PAST THE MAZURKA DANCERS AND ALMOST TREADING ON THEIR HEELS MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE MADAME AND HER DAUGHTER WERE SEATED YET HE APPROACHED THEM WITH GREAT DIFFIDENCE AND NONE OF HIS LATE MINCING AND PRANCING
THEN AGAIN HE SNUFFED THE AIR WHEN THE LADIES HAD TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RETURNED TO THEIR SEATS HE RESUMED HIS ATTEMPTS TO DISCERN FROM GLANCES AND EXPRESSIONS WHICH OF THEM COULD POSSIBLY BE THE UNKNOWN AUTHORESS
HE COULD NOT BUT SEE THAT IT MATTERED NOTHING AND THAT A FEW RUDE WORDS WERE OF NO ACCOUNT NOW THAT THE CHIEF POINT HAD BEEN ATTAINED YET MAN IS AN ODD CREATURE
AND ONE MAN EVEN BREAKING OFF A CONVERSATION AT THE MOST INTERESTING POINT NAMELY THE POINT THAT THE INFERIOR LAND COURT MUST BE MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING YES IN SPITE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INFERIOR LAND COURT
THOUGH HE COULD HAVE BORNE TO HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE ROTUND AND STOUT TO THAT THERE WOULD BE ADDED SCORNFUL REFERENCES TO LEAN HUSBANDS AND HINTS THAT THEY RESEMBLED TOOTH BRUSHES RATHER THAN MEN
AND THEN APPROACH ANOTHER ONE WITH THE SHORT MINCING STEPS USUALLY AFFECTED BY YOUNG OLD DANDIES WHO ARE FLUTTERING AROUND THE FAIR AS HE TURNED NOT WITHOUT DEXTERITY TO RIGHT AND LEFT HE KEPT ONE LEG SLIGHTLY DRAGGING BEHIND THE OTHER
AND SPENT OVER AN HOUR IN CONSIDERING THE SAME AT LENGTH MUTTERING A COMMENT UPON THE EPISTLE'S EFFLORESCENT STYLE
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE MIGHT BE A MILLIONAIRE AND INCLUDE IN HIS EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE AN INDEFINABLE ELEMENT OF GRANDNESS AND MARTIAL ARDOUR THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WHICH NO LADY WILL PARDON WHOSOEVER BE THE PERSON CONCERNED
NEVERTHELESS SOMETHING STRANGE SOMETHING WHICH HE COULD NOT ALTOGETHER EXPLAIN HAD COME UPON HIM
HIS EMOTION WAS SUCH THAT HE COULD NOT FORMULATE A SINGLE INTELLIGIBLE SYLLABLE HE COULD MERELY MURMUR THE DEVIL ONLY KNOWS WHAT THOUGH CERTAINLY NOTHING OF THE KIND WHICH WOULD HAVE RISEN TO THE LIPS OF THE HERO OF A FASHIONABLE NOVEL
THERE IS TO BE EVOKED THAT RESPECTFUL AFFECTION WHICH IS EVERY GOVERNOR'S DUE THENCEFORTH
AND NOW GREETED HIM WITH SUAVE EXPRESSEMENT AND THE WORDS SO HERE YOU ARE PAUL IVANOVITCH BUT WHAT SHE SAID NEXT I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO REPORT FOR SHE SPOKE IN THE ULTRA REFINED TONE AND VEIN WHEREIN
BUT THE LADIES WERE NOT GOING TO LET HIM OFF SO EASILY EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO USE UPON HIM HER EVERY WEAPON AND TO EXHIBIT WHATSOEVER MIGHT CHANCE TO CONSTITUTE HER BEST POINT YET THE LADIES WILES PROVED USELESS
SOMEHOW HER EXQUISITE SHAPE REMINDED HIM OF AN IVORY TOY IN SUCH FAIR WHITE TRANSPARENT RELIEF DID IT STAND OUT AGAINST THE DULL BLUR OF THE SURROUNDING THRONG HEREIN WE SEE A PHENOMENON NOT INFREQUENTLY OBSERVED
AS A SACRED THING SO SACRED THAT ON ONE OCCASION TWO CLOSELY RELATED LADIES WHO HAD ALSO BEEN CLOSELY ATTACHED FRIENDS WERE KNOWN TO FALL OUT WITH ONE ANOTHER OVER THE MERE FACT OF AN OMISSION TO RETURN A SOCIAL CALL
OR UTTER A COMPLIMENT WHICH HE HAS ELABORATED NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN MEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE HOWEVER STRONGLY THE SAID COMPLIMENT MAY SMACK OF A BOOK OF A SURETY THE THING WILL FALL FLAT EVEN A WITTICISM FROM HIM WILL BE LAUGHED AT FAR MORE BY HIM HIMSELF
YET WHAT FOLLY BALLS ARE THEY DO NOT CONSORT WITH THE RUSSIAN SPIRIT AND GENIUS AND THE DEVIL ONLY KNOWS WHY WE HAVE THEM A GROWN MIDDLE AGED MAN A MAN DRESSED IN BLACK AND LOOKING AS STIFF AS A POKER
INDEED SUCH WAS THE INTEREST TAKEN BY CERTAIN CITIZENS IN THE MATTER THAT THEY ADVISED THE PURCHASER TO PROVIDE HIMSELF AND HIS CONVOY WITH AN ESCORT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THEIR SAFE ARRIVAL AT THE APPOINTED DESTINATION
HE DECLARED ALSO THAT THERE WAS NO REAL NEED FOR AN ESCORT SEEING THAT THE PEASANTS WHOM HE HAD PURCHASED WERE EXCEPTIONALLY PEACE LOVING FOLK AND THAT BEING THEMSELVES CONSENTING PARTIES TO THE TRANSFERMENT THEY WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY PROVE IN EVERY WAY TRACTABLE
COULD RECITE THE WHOLE OF ZHUKOVSKI'S LUDMILLA BY HEART
SCENES OF A KIND WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF INSPIRING HUSBANDS TO GREAT AND KNIGHTLY IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT OF PROTECTING THE FAIR TRUE NEVER DID A DUEL ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE SINCE ALL THE HUSBANDS WERE OFFICIALS BELONGING TO THE CIVIL SERVICE
UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES BY THE HERO OF A FASHIONABLE NOVELETTE WHEN HE STOPPED SHORT AS THOUGH THUNDERSTRUCK BEFORE HIM THERE WAS STANDING NOT ONLY MADAME BUT ALSO A YOUNG GIRL WHOM SHE WAS HOLDING BY THE HAND
AND LONG BEFORE THE HOUR WHEN USUALLY HE RETURNED TO THE INN IN HIS LITTLE ROOM WITH ITS DOOR OF COMMUNICATION BLOCKED WITH A WARDROBE HIS FRAME OF MIND REMAINED AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS THE CHAIR IN WHICH HE WAS SEATED HIS HEART ACHED WITH A DULL UNPLEASANT SENSATION
IN THE SAME WAY CHICHIKOV SOUGHT A SCAPEGOAT UPON WHOSE SHOULDERS HE COULD LAY THE BLAME FOR ALL THAT HAD ANNOYED HIM HE FOUND ONE IN NOZDREV AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT THE SCAPEGOAT IN QUESTION RECEIVED A GOOD DRUBBING FROM EVERY SIDE
ALREADY REFERRED TO IN PASSING IT MAY BE SAID THAT SUCH FESTIVITIES ARE NOT INFREQUENT PHENOMENA IN COUNTY TOWNS FOR THE REASON THAT WHERE GOVERNORS EXIST THERE MUST TAKE PLACE BALLS IF FROM THE LOCAL GENTRY
SO DEEPLY DID THOSE FAIR PURSUERS ENMESH HIM IN THE TOILS OF SMALL TALK WHICH THEY ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE EXPEDIENT OF ASKING HIM ENDLESS SUBTLE RIDDLES
BUT INCOMPARABLY MORE STRIKING WAS THE IMPRESSION A MATTER FOR UNBOUNDED SURPRISE WHICH HE PRODUCED UPON THE LADIES PROPERLY TO EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON I SHOULD NEED TO SAY A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE LADIES THEMSELVES AND TO DESCRIBE IN THE MOST VIVID OF COLOURS
LIKEWISE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE THE SORT OF MEN TO WHOM IN THEIR MORE INTIMATE MOVEMENTS THEIR WIVES WOULD VERY NATURALLY ADDRESS SUCH NICKNAMES AS TOBY JUG MARMOT FATTY POT BELLY SMUTTY KIKI AND BUZZ BUZZ THEY WERE MEN ALSO OF GOOD HEART
EVENTUALLY THIS MONSTROSITY DREW UP AT THE GATES OF A HOUSE WHERE THE ARCHPRIEST OF ONE OF THE CHURCHES RESIDED AND FROM ITS DOORS THERE LEAPT A DAMSEL CLAD IN A JERKIN AND WEARING A SCARF OVER HER HEAD FOR A WHILE
THESE COMMENTS I HAVE INTERPOSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPLAINING TO THE READER WHY AS OUR HERO CONVERSED THE MAIDEN BEGAN TO YAWN BLIND TO THIS HOWEVER HE CONTINUED TO RELATE TO HER SUNDRY ADVENTURES WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIM IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD MEANWHILE
INDEED THERE WAS SO MUCH THAT WAS ALLURING AND PROVOCATIVE OF CURIOSITY IN THE ANONYMOUS MISSIVE THAT HE READ IT THROUGH A SECOND TIME AND THEN A THIRD AND FINALLY SAID TO HIMSELF I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO SENT IT IN SHORT HE TOOK THE THING SERIOUSLY
THE PINE FOREST WAS ASLEEP AND THE VALLEY AT REST
WIDOW OF A COLLEGIATE SECRETARY THE REASON OF HER SUDDEN ARRIVAL WAS THAT SHE HAD FELT SO UNEASY ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF CHICHIKOV'S WHIM THAT DURING THE THREE NIGHTS FOLLOWING HIS DEPARTURE SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SLEEP A WINK WHEREAFTER
THAT ONE DOES NOT CARE EVEN TO THINK OF IT IT ALSO LEAVES ONE'S HEAD PERFECTLY EMPTY EVEN AS DOES THE EXERTION OF TALKING TO A MAN OF THE WORLD A MAN OF THAT KIND CHATTERS AWAY AND TOUCHES LIGHTLY UPON EVERY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT
AND WOULD AT ONCE BE FIRED WITH VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION WHEN THEY HEARD OF A CASE OF VICE OR SEDUCTION NAY EVEN TO MERE FRAILTY THEY WOULD AWARD THE LASH WITHOUT MERCY ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD ANY INSTANCE OF WHAT THEY CALLED THIRD PERSONISM
WERE TOO TAKEN ABACK TO REPLY THE HALF TIPSY NOZDREV WITHOUT NOTICING THEM CONTINUED HIS HARANGUE AS BEFORE AH MY FINE SIR HE CRIED THIS TIME I DON'T MEAN TO LET YOU GO
AND STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THE PREVAILING MODE THEY SURPASSED EVEN THE LADIES OF MOSCOW AND SAINT PETERSBURG SEEING THAT THEY DRESSED WITH TASTE
EVEN AS IT CERTAINLY IS IN LIFE ARE THEREFORE SUCH FUNCTIONS RIGHT OR WRONG ONE WOULD ANSWER THAT THE DEVIL ALONE KNOWS AND THEN SPIT AND CLOSE THE BOOK
NOR WERE HIS COLLEAGUES A WIT INFERIOR TO HIM IN ENLIGHTENMENT FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THEM MADE A REGULAR PRACTICE OF READING KARAMZIN ANOTHER OF CONNING THE MOSCOW GAZETTE AND A THIRD OF NEVER LOOKING AT A BOOK AT ALL
LIKE MOST OF THE FEMALE WORLD OF SAINT PETERSBURG THE LADIES OF N WERE PRE EMINENTLY CAREFUL AND REFINED IN THEIR CHOICE OF WORDS AND PHRASES NEVER DID A LADY SAY I BLEW MY NOSE OR I PERSPIRED OR I SPAT
ALSO WHEN SEATED HE CONTINUED TO PEEP BETWEEN HIS NEIGHBOURS BACKS AND SHOULDERS UNTIL AT LAST HE DISCOVERED HER SITTING BESIDE HER MOTHER WHO WAS WEARING A SORT OF ORIENTAL TURBAN AND FEATHER UPON THAT
HAD SUDDENLY BECOME A THING REMOTE THAT THE ORCHESTRA HAD WITHDRAWN BEHIND A HILL AND THE SCENE GROWN MISTY LIKE THE CARELESSLY PAINTED IN BACKGROUND OF A PICTURE AND FROM THAT MISTY VOID THERE COULD BE SEEN GLIMMERING ONLY THE DELICATE OUTLINES OF THE BEWITCHING MAIDEN
BUT THAT WAS A TRIFLE SINCE THE QUATRAIN AT LEAST CONFORMED TO THE MODE THEN PREVALENT
I WOULD ASK IS THIS LIFE OF OURS INQUIRED THE WRITER TIS NOUGHT BUT A VALE OF WOE AND WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THE WORLD TIS NOUGHT BUT A MOB OF UNTHINKING HUMANITY
UNTIL A TACIT EDICT OF PROSCRIPTION HAD BEEN ISSUED AGAINST BOTH HIM AND THE POOR YOUNG MAIDEN BUT AN EVEN MORE UNPLEASANT SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR OUR HERO
INDEED NOT A FACE WAS THERE TO BE SEEN ON WHICH ECSTATIC DELIGHT OR AT ALL EVENTS THE REFLECTION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ECSTATIC DELIGHT WAS NOT PAINTED THE SAME EXPRESSION MAY BE DISCERNED ON THE FACES OF SUBORDINATE OFFICIALS WHEN
AND ALSO TOUCHED LIGHTLY UPON THE SUBJECT OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY THERE APPEARED FROM AN ADJOINING ROOM THE FIGURE OF NOZDREV WHETHER HE HAD COME FROM THE BUFFET OR WHETHER HE HAD ISSUED FROM A LITTLE GREEN RETREAT WHERE A GAME MORE STRENUOUS THAN WHIST HAD BEEN IN PROGRESS
AGAIN THEY LOOKED UPON A VISITING CARD
MARS LIKE MILITARY EXPRESSION A THING WHICH AS WE KNOW NEVER FAILS TO PLEASE THE FEMININE EYE CERTAIN OF THE LADIES EVEN TOOK TO BICKERING OVER HIM AND ON PERCEIVING THAT HE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME STANDING NEAR THE DOOR
IN CONCLUSION THE WRITER GAVE WAY TO UNCONCEALED DESPAIR AND WOUND UP WITH THE FOLLOWING VERSES TWO TURTLE DOVES TO THEE ONE DAY MY DUST WILL SHOW CONGEALED IN DEATH AND COOING WEARILY THEY'LL SAY
BUT ONLY A POSTSCRIPT EXPRESSING A CONJECTURE THAT CHICHIKOV'S OWN HEART WOULD TELL HIM WHO THE WRITER WAS AND STATING IN ADDITION THAT THE SAID WRITER WOULD BE PRESENT AT THE GOVERNOR'S BALL ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THIS GREATLY INTERESTED CHICHIKOV
A MAN PERHAPS WHO HAS NEVER BEFORE COMPASSED A SMILE
IN TURN HANDED HIM OVER TO THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES WHO AGAIN COMMITTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF THE TOWN ARCHITECT EVEN THE GOVERNOR WHO HITHERTO HAD BEEN STANDING AMONG HIS WOMENFOLK WITH A BOX OF SWEETS IN ONE HAND AND A LAP DOG IN THE OTHER NOW THREW DOWN BOTH SWEETS AND LAP DOG
FINALLY HE TAPPED HIMSELF LIGHTLY ON THE CHIN AND SAID AH GOOD OLD FACE IN THE SAME WAY WHEN HE STARTED TO DRESS HIMSELF FOR THE CEREMONY THE LEVEL OF HIS HIGH SPIRITS REMAINED UNIMPAIRED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS THAT IS TO SAY
YES WE ALL KNOW WHY BRIBES ARE ACCEPTED AND WHY MEN BECOME CROOKED IN SOUL IT IS ALL DONE TO PROVIDE WIVES YES MAY THE PIT SWALLOW THEM UP WITH FAL LALS AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE
AS AGAINST THE FACT THAT AT THIS PARTICULAR ONE HE HAD BEEN EXPOSED HE HAD BEEN MADE TO DISCLOSE THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE HAD BEEN PLAYING A STRANGE AN AMBIGUOUS PART OF COURSE WHEN HE REVIEWED THE CONTRETEMPS IN THE LIGHT OF PURE REASON
OR WHETHER HE HAD LEFT THE LATTER RESORT UNAIDED OR WHETHER HE HAD BEEN EXPELLED THEREFROM IS UNKNOWN BUT AT ALL EVENTS WHEN HE ENTERED THE BALLROOM HE WAS IN AN ELEVATED CONDITION AND LEADING BY THE ARM THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR
NOZDREV DESCRIED OUR HERO AND BORE DOWN UPON HIM AH MY FINE LANDOWNER OF KHERSON HE CRIED WITH A SMILE WHICH SET HIS FRESH SPRING ROSE PINK CHEEKS A QUIVER HAVE YOU BEEN DOING MUCH TRADE IN DEPARTED SOULS LATELY
WITH THAT HE TURNED TO THE GOVERNOR I SUPPOSE YOUR EXCELLENCY KNOWS THAT THIS MAN TRAFFICS IN DEAD PEASANTS HE BAWLED LOOK HERE CHICHIKOV I TELL YOU IN THE MOST FRIENDLY WAY POSSIBLE THAT EVERY ONE HERE LIKES YOU YES INCLUDING EVEN THE GOVERNOR
THEIR SOCIAL INTERCOURSE AND SPIRITUAL QUALITIES YET THIS WOULD BE A DIFFICULT THING FOR ME TO DO SINCE ON THE ONE HAND I SHOULD BE HAMPERED BY MY BOUNDLESS RESPECT FOR THE WOMENFOLK OF ALL CIVIL SERVICE OFFICIALS AND ON THE OTHER HAND WELL SIMPLY BY THE INNATE ARDUOUSNESS OF THE TASK
EVEN AS AN EXPERIENCED CAPTAIN OR CHIEF OF POLICE WILL GIVE A KNAVISH STAROSTA OR POSTBOY A RATING NOT ONLY IN THE TERMS BECOME CLASSICAL BUT ALSO IN SUCH TERMS AS THE SAID CAPTAIN OR CHIEF OF POLICE MAY INVENT FOR HIMSELF
FOUR COUPLES HAD NOW BEGUN TO THREAD THE MAZES OF THE MAZURKA IN PARTICULAR WAS A MILITARY STAFF CAPTAIN WORKING BODY AND SOUL AND ARMS AND LEGS TO COMPASS SUCH A SERIES OF STEPS AS WERE NEVER BEFORE PERFORMED EVEN IN A DREAM
MIGHT WE POOR CUMBERERS OF THE GROUND MAKE SO BOLD AS TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU ARE THINKING OF PRAY TELL US WHERE LIE THE HAPPY REGIONS IN WHICH YOUR THOUGHTS ARE WANDERING
YET HE WAS NOT ANGRY WITH HIMSELF OF THAT YOU MAY BE SURE SEEING THAT ALL OF US HAVE A SLIGHT WEAKNESS FOR SPARING OUR OWN FAULTS AND ALWAYS DO OUR BEST TO FIND SOME FELLOW CREATURE UPON WHOM TO VENT OUR DISPLEASURE
LIKE A MAN WHO AFTER ISSUING INTO THE STREET FOR A PLEASANT WALK HAS SUDDENLY COME TO A HALT ON REMEMBERING THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND HIM IN A MOMENT AS HE STRUGGLES TO RECALL WHAT THAT SOMETHING IS
LIKE A SHORT TAIL OR COMMA THIS TRICK THE LADIES PARTICULARLY ADMIRED IN SHORT THEY NOT ONLY DISCOVERED IN HIM A HOST OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND ATTRACTIONS BUT ALSO BEGAN TO SEE IN HIS FACE A SORT OF GRAND
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HIS PURPOSE WAS TO CARRY THE POSITION BY STORM FOR WHETHER MOVED BY THE INFLUENCE OF SPRING OR WHETHER MOVED BY A PUSH FROM BEHIND HE PRESSED FORWARD WITH SUCH DESPERATE RESOLUTION THAT HIS ELBOW CAUSED THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES TO STAGGER ON HIS FEET
THAT THE MERE SOUND OF THE WORD EXERCISES UPON RASCALS UPON DECENT FOLK AND UPON FOLK WHO ARE NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER AN UNDENIABLE INFLUENCE A MILLIONAIRE SUFFERS FROM THE DISADVANTAGE OF EVERYWHERE HAVING TO BEHOLD MEANNESS
BUT HIS WORDS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PURCHASE OF DEAD SOULS HAD NONE THE LESS BEEN UTTERED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE AND BEEN ACCOMPANIED WITH SUCH UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER THAT THE CURIOSITY EVEN OF THOSE WHO HAD HAPPENED TO BE SITTING OR STANDING IN THE REMOTER CORNERS OF THE ROOM HAD BEEN AROUSED
THE PHENOMENON OF THE CHICHIKOVS OF THIS WORLD BECOMING TEMPORARILY POETS AT ALL EVENTS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO OUR CHICHIKOV FELT THAT HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AGAIN IF NOT EXACTLY A MILITARY OFFICER ON PERCEIVING AN EMPTY CHAIR BESIDE THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
IN COMPANY WITH A PLAY BILL AND AN INVITATION TO A WEDDING THE LATTER OF WHICH HAD FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS REPOSED IN THE SELF SAME RECEPTACLE AND IN THE SELF SAME POSITION SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THERE ARRIVED A CARD OF INVITATION TO THE GOVERNOR'S BALL
WE KNOW THAT AT GOVERNOR'S BALLS IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR THE ONLOOKERS TO COMPOSE VERSES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE DANCERS AND IN THIS CASE THE VERSES WERE DIRECTED TO CHICHIKOV'S ADDRESS BRIEFLY THE PREVAILING DISSATISFACTION GREW
AND VERY READY TO EXTEND THEIR HOSPITALITY AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP WHEN ONCE A GUEST HAD EATEN OF THEIR BREAD AND SALT OR SPENT AN EVENING IN THEIR COMPANY PARTICULARLY THEREFORE DID CHICHIKOV EARN THESE GOOD FOLK'S APPROVAL WITH HIS TAKING METHODS AND QUALITIES
THE EFFECT WAS ALSO FURTHER HEIGHTENED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH AT SUCH MOMENTS HE ASSUMED THE MOST PORTENTOUS FROWN FOR HIS PART THE POSTMASTER WENT IN MORE FOR PHILOSOPHY
HOW ABSURD TOO WERE THOSE OVERDRESSED WOMEN ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE HAD A THOUSAND ROUBLES ON HER BACK AND ALL ACQUIRED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OVERTAXED PEASANT OR WORSE STILL AT THAT OF THE CONSCIENCE OF HER NEIGHBOUR
NO NOT UNTIL I HAVE LEARNT WHAT ALL THIS PURCHASING OF DEAD PEASANTS MEANS LOOK HERE YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF YES I SAY THAT I WHO AM ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS HERE HE TURNED TO THE GOVERNOR AGAIN
VERY WELL THAT BEING SO I WILL MERELY SAY A WORD OR TWO CONCERNING THE MOST PROMINENT TINTS ON THE FEMININE PALETTE OF N MERELY A WORD OR TWO CONCERNING THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF ITS LADIES AND A WORD OR TWO CONCERNING THEIR MORE SUPERFICIAL CHARACTERISTICS
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CUSTOMARILY EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN HIGH CLASS NOVELS WHICH HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY EXPERTS MORE QUALIFIED THAN I AM TO DESCRIBE SALONS AND ABLE TO BOAST OF SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH GOOD SOCIETY IN EFFECT
AND TALKS IN SMOOTH FLUENT PHRASES WHICH HE HAS CULLED FROM BOOKS WITHOUT GRAZING THEIR SUBSTANCE WHEREAS GO AND HAVE A CHAT WITH A TRADESMAN WHO KNOWS AT LEAST ONE THING THOROUGHLY AND THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF EXPERIENCE
YOUR EXCELLENCY HE CONTINUED YOU WOULD NEVER BELIEVE WHAT INSEPERABLES THIS MAN AND I HAVE BEEN INDEED IF YOU HAD STOOD THERE AND SAID TO ME NOZDREV TELL ME ON YOUR HONOUR WHICH OF THE TWO YOU LOVE BEST YOUR FATHER OR CHICHIKOV I SHOULD HAVE REPLIED
IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HER HORSES WERE NOT SHOD SHE HAD SET OFF FOR THE TOWN IN ORDER TO LEARN AT FIRST HAND HOW THE DEAD SOULS WERE FARING AND WHETHER WHICH MIGHT GOD FORFEND SHE HAD NOT SOLD THEM AT SOMETHING LIKE A THIRD OF THEIR TRUE VALUE
THEY NOW LIKED HIM MORE THAN EVER AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY WERE CITIZENS OF AN EXCEPTIONALLY QUIET GOOD NATURED EASY GOING DISPOSITION AND SOME OF THEM WERE EVEN WELL EDUCATED FOR INSTANCE THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL COUNCIL
AND EVEN THE WRONGED HUSBAND HOLDING HIMSELF READY SHOULD HE MEET WITH OR HEAR OF THE THIRD PERSON TO QUOTE IN A MILD AND RATIONAL MANNER THE PROVERB WHOM CONCERNS IT THAT A FRIEND SHOULD CONSORT WITH FRIEND IN ADDITION I MAY SAY THAT
MIGHT WE BE INFORMED OF THE NAME OF HER WHO HAS PLUNGED YOU INTO THIS SWEET ABANDONMENT OF MEDITATION
SINCE THE SAME WORDS IF SPOKEN IN FRENCH WERE ANOTHER MATTER ALTOGETHER
THE LADIES OF N WERE BUT NO I CANNOT DO IT MY HEART HAS ALREADY FAILED ME COME COME THE LADIES OF N WERE DISTINGUISHED FOR BUT IT IS OF NO USE
AND CAUSING A BRUSH TO SLIDE FROM THE TABLE TO THE FLOOR LATER HIS ENTRY INTO THE BALLROOM PRODUCED AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFECT EVERY ONE PRESENT CAME FORWARD TO MEET HIM SOME WITH CARDS IN THEIR HANDS
THE NEWLY ARRIVED DIRECTOR HAVING MADE HIS INSPECTION THE SAID OFFICIALS ARE BEGINNING TO GET OVER THEIR FIRST SENSE OF AWE ON PERCEIVING THAT HE HAS FOUND MUCH TO COMMEND AND THAT HE CAN EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO JEST AND UTTER A FEW WORDS OF SMILING APPROVAL
HE PRACTISED PERFORMING A SERIES OF BOWS TO HIS REFLECTION ACCOMPANIED WITH CERTAIN MURMURS INTENDED TO BEAR A RESEMBLANCE TO A FRENCH PHRASE THOUGH CHICHIKOV KNEW NOT A SINGLE WORD OF THE GALLIC TONGUE LASTLY CAME THE PERFORMING OF A SERIES OF WHAT I MIGHT CALL
BUT ALL WAS OF NO AVAIL MATTERS KEPT GOING AS AWRY AS A BADLY BENT HOOP TWICE HE BLUNDERED IN HIS PLAY AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HIS FRIEND PAUL IVANOVITCH LATELY SO GOOD AND SO CIRCUMSPECT A PLAYER
AND HE WANTED TO BARGAIN WITH ME FOR MY DEAD ONES LOOK HERE CHICHIKOV YOU ARE A SWINE YES BY GOD YOU ARE AN UTTER SWINE
YET THOUGH THOSE GLANCES AND EXPRESSIONS WERE TOO SUBTLE TOO INSUFFICIENTLY OPEN THE DIFFICULTY IN NO WAY DIMINISHED HIS HIGH SPIRITS EASILY AND GRACEFULLY DID HE EXCHANGE AGREEABLE BANDINAGE WITH ONE LADY
TO RIGHT AND LEFT DID HE INCLINE HIS HEAD IN THE SIDELONG YET UNCONSTRAINED MANNER THAT WAS HIS WONT AND NEVER FAILED TO CHARM THE BEHOLDER AS FOR THE LADIES THEY CLUSTERED AROUND HIM IN A SHINING BEVY THAT WAS REDOLENT OF EVERY SPECIES OF PERFUME
NEVERTHELESS HAD I MY WAY I WOULD HANG YOU YES BY GOD I WOULD CHICHIKOV'S DISCOMFITURE WAS COMPLETE AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT YOUR EXCELLENCY WENT ON NOZDREV BUT THIS FELLOW ACTUALLY SAID TO ME SELL ME YOUR DEAD SOULS
I THINK THAT YOU HAVE NOT MET MY DAUGHTER BEFORE SAID MADAME SHE IS JUST FRESH FROM SCHOOL HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD HAD THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING MADEMOISELLE BEFORE AND UNDER RATHER UNEXPECTED CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT HE FORGOT THE CLAIMS OF COURTESY WHICH REQUIRED HIM FIRST OF ALL TO GREET HIS HOSTESS IN FACT HE REMEMBERED THOSE CLAIMS ONLY ON HEARING THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE HERSELF ADDRESSING HIM SHE HAD BEEN STANDING BEFORE HIM FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
BUT ON HIS TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING FURTHER HIS TONGUE COMPLETELY FAILED HIM THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE ADDED A WORD OR TWO AND THEN CARRIED OFF HER DAUGHTER TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE OTHER GUESTS CHICHIKOV STOOD ROOTED TO THE SPOT
HE FELT MUCH AS DOES A MAN WHO SHOD WITH WELL POLISHED BOOTS HAS JUST STEPPED INTO A DIRTY STINKING PUDDLE HE TRIED TO PUT AWAY FROM HIM THE OCCURRENCE AND TO EXPAND AND TO ENJOY HIMSELF ONCE MORE NAY HE EVEN TOOK A HAND AT WHIST
THAT A SIMILAR INCLINATION TO MEANNESS SEIZED UPON THE LADIES OF N GOES WITHOUT SAYING WITH THE RESULT THAT MANY A DRAWING ROOM HEARD IT WHISPERED THAT IF CHICHIKOV WAS NOT EXACTLY A BEAUTY AT LEAST HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY GOOD LOOKING TO SERVE FOR A HUSBAND
THAT IS TO SAY THROUGH THE OUTLYING STREETS AND ALLEYS OF THE TOWN THERE WAS CLATTERING A VEHICLE TO WHICH IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT PRECISELY TO ASSIGN A NAME SEEING THAT THOUGH IT WAS OF A SPECIES PECULIAR TO ITSELF IT MOST NEARLY RESEMBLED A LARGE RICKETY WATER MELON ON WHEELS
ALSO SUCH CROWDS OF FEMININE SHOPPERS BEGAN TO REPAIR TO THE BAZAAR AS ALMOST TO CONSTITUTE A CRUSH AND SOMETHING LIKE A PROCESSION OF CARRIAGES ENSUED SO LONG GREW THE RANK OF VEHICLES FOR THEIR PART
SHE THUMPED THE GATES SO VIGOROUSLY AS TO SET ALL THE DOGS BARKING THEN THE GATES STIFFLY OPENED AND ADMITTED THIS UNWIELDY PHENOMENON OF THE ROAD LASTLY THE BARINIA HERSELF ALIGHTED AND STOOD REVEALED AS MADAME KOROBOTCHKA
OF ROSES OF SPRING VIOLETS AND OF MIGNONETTE SO MUCH SO THAT INSTINCTIVELY CHICHIKOV RAISED HIS NOSE TO SNUFF THE AIR LIKEWISE THE LADIES DRESSES DISPLAYED AN ENDLESS PROFUSION OF TASTE AND VARIETY
BUT ALLOW ME TO IMPRINT AT LEAST ONE BAISER UPON YOUR LILY WHITE CHEEK AND IN HIS EFFORTS TO FORCE UPON CHICHIKOV WHAT HE TERMED HIS BAISERS HE CAME NEAR TO MEASURING HIS LENGTH UPON THE FLOOR EVERY ONE NOW EDGED AWAY AND TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HIS FURTHER BABBLINGS
WITH IT ALL HOWEVER THERE WENT A SECOND SOURCE OF DISSATISFACTION
WAS AN HOUR SPENT FIRST OF ALL HE STROVE TO MAKE HIS FEATURES ASSUME AN AIR OF DIGNITY AND IMPORTANCE AND THEN AN AIR OF HUMBLE BUT FAINTLY SATIRICAL RESPECT AND THEN AN AIR OF RESPECT GUILTLESS OF ANY ALLOY WHATSOEVER NEXT
YES IN SPITE OF THE BEST EFFORTS OF HUSBANDS AND KINSFOLK TO RECONCILE THE ANTAGONISTS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THOUGH ALL ELSE IN THE WORLD MIGHT CONCEIVABLY BE POSSIBLE NEVER COULD THE HATCHET BE BURIED BETWEEN LADIES WHO HAD QUARRELLED OVER A NEGLECTED VISIT
WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE STILL FURTHER INCREASED HIS CONFUSION THAT NOZDREV WAS A NOTORIOUS LIAR EVERY ONE OF COURSE KNEW AND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN VENT TO AN IDIOTIC OUTBURST OF THIS SORT HAD SURPRISED NO ONE BUT A DEAD SOUL WELL
MADE THEM DELAY AWHILE YET WHEN THE MISERY OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES BECAME GLARING AN ENTHUSIASTIC GENEROSITY INSPIRED THEIR DECREES
AND UNGENIAL WHEN THE SLEEPING WIND HAS AWOKE IN THE EAST OR WHEN THE DUN CLOUDS THICKLY VEIL THE SKY
WHAT WILL BECOME OF US AT LENGTH IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE NEWSPAPERS THE PARAGRAPH WAS INSERTED IN AN OBSCURE PART WE REGRET TO STATE
OUR PLEASURE GROUNDS AND PARKS LIVE STOCK DIMINISHED SENSIBLY IN THE COUNTRY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE GREAT DEMAND IN THE MARKET EVEN THE POOR DEER OUR ANTLERED PROTEGES
WHICH EVEN ADDED A CHANCE TO OUR ESCAPE THESE WERE QUESTIONS OF PRUDENCE THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE NECESSITY FOR AN EARNEST CAUTION ENGLAND WAS STILL SECURE FRANCE
CONCOMITANTS WINTER WAS HAILED A GENERAL AND NEVER FAILING PHYSICIAN
THROWING HIS ARMS ASIDE HE MUST FOR PRESENT ENDS GIVE UP THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF HIS ENDEAVOURS HE CAME TO WINDSOR TO CONSULT WITH US EVERY DAY ADDED TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
AND NOT STRETCH OUT A HAND TO SAVE THEM AS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE ENGLISH UNLOCKED THEIR HOSPITABLE STORE FOR THE RELIEF OF THOSE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES BY POLITICAL REVOLUTION
AND THE IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR PROGRESS YIELDED AT THEIR TOUCH COULD WE TAKE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS POWER AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO ITS OPERATION COULD WE DOMESTICATE A CUB OF THIS WILD BEAST
THESE REFLECTIONS MADE OUR LEGISLATORS PAUSE BEFORE THEY COULD DECIDE ON THE LAWS TO BE PUT IN FORCE THE EVIL WAS SO WIDE SPREADING SO VIOLENT AND IMMEDICABLE THAT NO CARE NO PREVENTION COULD BE JUDGED SUPERFLUOUS
ATTENDED BY WHOLE TROOPS OF THE INDIGENT TO CUT DOWN THEIR WOODS TO ERECT TEMPORARY DWELLINGS AND TO PORTION OUT THEIR PARKS PARTERRES AND FLOWER GARDENS
WE WERE AS A MAN WHO HEARS THAT HIS HOUSE IS BURNING AND YET HURRIES THROUGH THE STREETS BORNE ALONG BY A LURKING HOPE OF A MISTAKE
ITS OBSCURITY OF SITUATION RENDERED IT THE MORE CONSPICUOUS THE DIMINUTIVE LETTERS GREW GIGANTIC TO THE BEWILDERED EYE OF FEAR THEY SEEMED GRAVEN
AND OUR ISLAND HAD BECOME THE REFUGE OF THOUSANDS IN THE MEAN TIME
WHETHER TRAVELLERS OR RESIDENTS CAME POURING IN ONE GREAT REVULSIVE STREAM BACK ON THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WITH THEM CROWDS OF ITALIANS AND SPANIARDS
THEIR DEADLY POWER SHOOK THE FLOURISHING COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH AND DURING WINTER EVEN WE IN OUR NORTHERN RETREAT BEGAN TO QUAKE UNDER THEIR ILL EFFECTS
THE ARRIVAL OF FRESH VESSELS WITH EMIGRANTS THE TOTAL CESSATION OF COMMERCE THE STARVING MULTITUDE THAT THRONGED AROUND THE PALACE OF THE PROTECTORATE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH
HINDOSTAN THE CROWDED ABODES OF THE CHINESE ARE MENACED WITH UTTER RUIN WHERE LATE THE BUSY MULTITUDES ASSEMBLED FOR PLEASURE OR PROFIT
WHOSE TRADE DEPENDED ON EXPORTS AND INTERCHANGE OF WEALTH BECAME BANKRUPT SUCH THINGS WHEN THEY HAPPEN SINGLY AFFECT ONLY THE IMMEDIATE PARTIES BUT THE PROSPERITY OF THE NATION WAS NOW SHAKEN BY FREQUENT AND EXTENSIVE LOSSES
NOW ONLY THE SOUND OF WAILING AND MISERY IS HEARD THE AIR IS EMPOISONED AND EACH HUMAN BEING INHALES DEATH EVEN WHILE IN YOUTH AND HEALTH THEIR HOPES ARE IN THE FLOWER
AND BRING BACK THE EARTH TO ITS ACCUSTOMED HEALTH
AND SEES HIS SHELTERING ROOF ENVELOPED IN A FLAME BEFORE IT HAD BEEN A RUMOUR BUT NOW IN WORDS UNERASEABLE IN DEFINITE AND UNDENIABLE PRINT THE KNOWLEDGE WENT FORTH
ADRIAN DID NOT REST ONLY WITH THE EXERTIONS HE COULD MAKE WITH REGARD TO HIS OWN POSSESSIONS HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE WEALTHY OF THE LAND HE MADE PROPOSALS IN PARLIAMENT LITTLE ADAPTED TO PLEASE THE RICH
AND SUBDUING THE REBEL EARTH INTO SOME SORT OF OBEDIENCE THE GOD SENDS DOWN HIS ANGRY PLAGUES FROM HIGH FAMINE AND PESTILENCE IN HEAPS THEY DIE AGAIN IN VENGEANCE OF HIS WRATH HE FALLS
BUT WHEN ANY WHOLE NATION BECOMES THE VICTIM OF THE DESTRUCTIVE POWERS OF EXTERIOR AGENTS THEN INDEED MAN SHRINKS INTO INSIGNIFICANCE HE FEELS HIS TENURE OF LIFE INSECURE
VISITATION WE BREATHED AGAIN
ON THEIR GREAT HOSTS AND BREAKS THEIR TOTTERING WALLS ARRESTS THEIR NAVIES ON THE OCEAN'S PLAIN AND WHELMS THEIR STRENGTH WITH MOUNTAINS OF THE MAIN
WE A COMMERCIAL PEOPLE WERE OBLIGED TO BRING SUCH SCHEMES UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE QUESTION OF CONTAGION BECAME MATTER OF EARNEST DISQUISITION
HE MUST SELL HIS CHERISHED PLANS FOR THE PERMANENT GOOD OF HIS COUNTRY FOR TEMPORARY RELIEF HE MUST AIM NO MORE AT THE DEAR OBJECT OF HIS AMBITION
AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PLAGUE RAGED
ENTIRELY INTO EVERY CLASS AND DIVISION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT OF NECESSITY THEY BECAME THE FIRST QUESTION IN THE STATE THE CHIEF SUBJECTS TO WHICH WE MUST TURN OUR ATTENTION
OUR CASTLE BECAME AN ASYLUM FOR THE UNHAPPY A LITTLE POPULATION OCCUPIED ITS HALLS THE REVENUE OF ITS POSSESSOR WHICH HAD ALWAYS FOUND A MODE OF EXPENDITURE CONGENIAL TO HIS GENEROUS NATURE
SOME DISORDER HAD SURELY CREPT INTO THE COURSE OF THE ELEMENTS DESTROYING THEIR BENIGNANT INFLUENCE THE WIND PRINCE OF AIR RAGED THROUGH HIS KINGDOM LASHING THE SEA INTO FURY
CAN IT BE TRUE EACH ASKED THE OTHER WITH WONDER AND DISMAY THAT WHOLE COUNTRIES ARE LAID WASTE WHOLE NATIONS ANNIHILATED BY THESE DISORDERS IN NATURE THE VAST CITIES OF AMERICA THE FERTILE PLAINS OF
A RUIN AND A WRECK UPON THE FIELDS OF THE ATLANTIC WHAT ARE WE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS GLOBE LEAST AMONG THE MANY THAT PEOPLE INFINITE SPACE OUR MINDS EMBRACE INFINITY
HAD THE SAME POWERS AS I I
IN THE BOUNDS AND BANKS WHICH HAD HITHERTO KEPT THEM OUT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF SUMMER WE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WAS GREATER THAN WE HAD AT FIRST SUSPECTED
THESE SPECULATIONS WERE RIFE AMONG US YET NOT THE LESS WE PROCEEDED IN OUR DAILY OCCUPATIONS AND OUR PLANS WHOSE ACCOMPLISHMENT DEMANDED THE LAPSE OF MANY YEARS NO VOICE WAS HEARD TELLING US TO HOLD
SO FAR AS TO MAKE A REACTION DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO PESTILENCE WOULD CEASE IT WERE WELL THAT IN THE MEAN TIME
THE AVALANCHE THUNDERS DOWN THEIR VALLIES THOU HOLDEST THE KEYS OF THE FROST AND CANST FIRST CHAIN AND THEN SET FREE THE STREAMS UNDER THY GENTLE GOVERNANCE THE BUDS AND LEAVES ARE BORN
WERE OBLIGED TO FALL FOR THE SAKE OF WORTHIER PENSIONERS THE LABOUR NECESSARY TO BRING THE LANDS TO THIS SORT OF CULTURE EMPLOYED AND FED THE OFFCASTS OF THE DIMINISHED MANUFACTORIES
WHILE STARVATION DID ITS ACCUSTOMED WORK THOUSANDS DIED UNLAMENTED FOR BESIDE THE YET WARM CORPSE THE MOURNER WAS STRETCHED MADE MUTE BY DEATH
AND THESE WERE HIS VOWED ENEMIES HE MUST CONCILIATE THEM BY ABANDONING HIS FAVOURITE SCHEME OF EQUALIZATION HE MUST CONFIRM THEM
QUITO WAS DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE MEXICO LAID WASTE BY THE UNITED EFFECTS OF STORM PESTILENCE AND FAMINE CROWDS OF EMIGRANTS INUNDATED THE WEST OF EUROPE
THE CLOUDS BECOME THIN AN ARCH IS FORMED FOR EVER RISING UPWARDS TILL THE UNIVERSAL COPE BEING UNVEILED THE SUN POURS FORTH ITS RAYS RE ANIMATED AND FED BY THE BREEZE
UNTIL THE DANK EARTH REFUSING TO IMBIBE THE SUPERABUNDANT MOISTURE IT LIES IN POOLS ON THE SURFACE WHEN THE TORCH OF DAY SEEMS LIKE A METEOR TO BE QUENCHED
AND PRONOUNCE IN SUCH A CITY PLAGUE WILL DIE UNPRODUCTIVE IN SUCH ANOTHER NATURE HAS PROVIDED FOR IT A PLENTIFUL HARVEST
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED OUR FINE BREEDS OF HORSES OR HAVE UTTERLY CHANGED THE FACE OF THE ORNAMENTED PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
THE MOUNTING FLAMES HAD CURLED ROUND THE BUILDING AS IT FELL AND WAS DESTROYED THEY INSINUATED THEMSELVES INTO THE SUBSTANCES ABOUT THEM
HE HAD SOUGHT THIS OFFICE WITH EAGERNESS UNDER THE IDEA OF TURNING HIS WHOLE FORCES TO THE SUPPRESSION OF THE PRIVILEGED ORDERS OF OUR COMMUNITY
A BREATHLESS SENTIMENT OF WONDER A PAINFUL SENSE
WAS NOW ATTENDED TO MORE PARSIMONIOUSLY THAT IT MIGHT EMBRACE A WIDER PORTION OF UTILITY IT WAS NOT HOWEVER MONEY EXCEPT PARTIALLY BUT THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE
TO NECESSITOUS FAMILIES MANY OF THESE OF HIGH RANK IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES NOW WITH HOE IN HAND TURNED UP THE SOIL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY AT LAST
WE CALLED TO MIND THE PLAGUE OF THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN IT WAS CALCULATED THAT A THIRD OF MANKIND HAD BEEN DESTROYED AS YET WESTERN EUROPE WAS UNINFECTED WOULD IT ALWAYS BE SO
LET US LAMENT OVER AND ASSIST THE CHILDREN OF THE GARDEN OF THE EARTH LATE WE ENVIED THEIR ABODES THEIR SPICY GROVES FERTILE PLAINS AND ABUNDANT LOVELINESS BUT IN THIS MORTAL LIFE EXTREMES ARE ALWAYS MATCHED
ITS DELLS AND WOODS ITS COOL FOUNTAINS AND GARDENS OF ROSES ARE POLLUTED BY THE DEAD IN CIRCASSIA AND GEORGIA THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY WEEPS OVER THE RUIN OF ITS FAVOURITE TEMPLE THE FORM OF WOMAN
WHEN ANY ONE MET A FRIEND IN THE STREET HE ONLY CRIED AS HE HURRIED ON YOU KNOW WHILE THE OTHER WITH AN EJACULATION OF FEAR AND HORROR WOULD ANSWER
WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE CLOUD STIRRING NORTH ARISE THE STREAKED BLUE APPEAR AND SOON AN OPENING MADE IN THE VAPOURS IN THE EYE OF THE WIND THROUGH WHICH THE BRIGHT AZURE SHINES
MAN CONTINUES FOR EVER THUS LOSING OUR IDENTITY THAT OF WHICH WE ARE CHIEFLY CONSCIOUS WE GLORY IN THE CONTINUITY OF OUR SPECIES AND LEARN TO REGARD DEATH WITHOUT TERROR
THE BLOW WAS STRUCK THE ARISTOCRACY OBTAINED ALL THEY WISHED AND THEY SUBSCRIBED TO A TWELVEMONTHS BILL WHICH LEVIED TWENTY PER CENT ON ALL THE RENT ROLLS OF THE COUNTRY
ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF THIS MONTH NEWS ARRIVED IN LONDON THAT THE PLAGUE WAS IN FRANCE AND ITALY THESE TIDINGS WERE AT FIRST WHISPERED ABOUT TOWN BUT NO ONE DARED EXPRESS ALOUD THE SOUL QUAILING INTELLIGENCE
THEN MIGHTY ART THOU O WIND TO BE THRONED ABOVE ALL
PERCHANCE SOME STRICKEN ASIATIC
SO NOW THEY WERE NOT BACKWARD IN AFFORDING AID TO THE VICTIMS OF A MORE WIDE SPREADING CALAMITY WE HAD MANY FOREIGN FRIENDS WHOM WE EAGERLY SOUGHT OUT AND RELIEVED FROM DREADFUL PENURY
THAT THE PLAGUE WAS NOT WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED CONTAGIOUS LIKE THE SCARLET FEVER OR EXTINCT SMALL POX WAS PROVED IT WAS CALLED AN EPIDEMIC BUT THE GRAND QUESTION
AT LENGTH FORBADE A RECOURSE TO THE USUAL MODES OF RELIEF TRADE WAS STOPPED BY THE FAILURE OF THE INTERCHANGE OF CARGOES USUAL BETWEEN US AND AMERICA INDIA EGYPT AND GREECE
THE INFECTION HAD NOW SPREAD IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF FRANCE BUT THAT COUNTRY HAD SO MANY RESOURCES IN THE WAY OF AGRICULTURE
THAT FABLE IS UNJUST WHICH GIVES THE SUPERIORITY TO THE SUN OVER THE WIND WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE LIGHTSOME EARTH THE BALMY ATMOSPHERE AND BASKING NATURE BECOME DARK COLD
THE MOST LUXURIOUS WERE OFTEN THE FIRST TO PART WITH THEIR INDULGENCIES AS IS COMMON IN COMMUNITIES A FASHION WAS SET THE HIGH BORN LADIES OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE DEEMED THEMSELVES DISGRACED
AND ALL THAT MAN'S MIND COULD INVENT OR HIS FORCE ACHIEVE SHE COULD TAKE THE BALL IN HER HAND AND CAST IT INTO SPACE WHERE LIFE WOULD BE DRUNK UP AND MAN AND ALL HIS EFFORTS FOR EVER ANNIHILATED
THAT BECAME SCARCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY THE USUAL ONE OF IMPORTS WAS ENTIRELY CUT OFF IN THIS EMERGENCY TO FEED THE VERY PEOPLE TO WHOM WE HAD GIVEN REFUGE WE WERE OBLIGED TO YIELD TO THE PLOUGH
BUT ELSE IT WAS NOTHING SINGULAR TO SEE FEMALES OF RANK GOING ON FOOT TO PLACES OF FASHIONABLE RESORT IT WAS MORE COMMON FOR ALL WHO POSSESSED LANDED PROPERTY TO SECEDE TO THEIR ESTATES
TO CHECK THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE AND TO REMIND THOSE WHOSE GENEROSITY PROCEEDED TO LAVISH WASTE THAT UNTIL THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS BECAME PERMANENT OF WHICH THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD
OCEAN IS THY SLAVE THOU SWEEPEST OVER THE EARTH AND OAKS THE GROWTH OF CENTURIES SUBMIT TO THY VIEWLESS AXE THE SNOW DRIFT IS SCATTERED ON THE PINNACLES OF THE ALPS
OUR LITTLE ISLAND WAS FILLED EVEN TO BURSTING AT FIRST AN UNUSUAL QUANTITY OF SPECIE MADE ITS APPEARANCE WITH THE EMIGRANTS BUT THESE PEOPLE HAD NO MEANS OF RECEIVING BACK INTO THEIR HANDS WHAT THEY SPENT AMONG US
WHEN FOREIGN DISTRESSES CAME TO BE FELT BY US THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WE SET OURSELVES TO APPLY REMEDIES SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE EMIGRANTS AND MERCHANTS BANKRUPT BY THE FAILURE OF TRADE
TO THEIR EXCESS IT WAS AUGUST SO THERE COULD BE SMALL HOPE OF RELIEF DURING THE HEATS ON THE CONTRARY
OF OUR BEING IS SUBJECT TO MEREST ACCIDENT DAY BY DAY WE ARE FORCED TO BELIEVE THIS HE WHOM A SCRATCH HAS DISORGANIZED HE WHO DISAPPEARS FROM APPARENT LIFE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOSTILE AGENCY AT WORK AROUND US
WERE WELCOMED WITH GRATITUDE THE EFFECTS OF PURIFYING COLD WERE IMMEDIATELY FELT AND THE LISTS OF MORTALITY ABROAD WERE
PLAGUE DIES WITH HIM UNCOMMUNICATED AND INNOXIOUS LET US WEEP FOR OUR BRETHREN THOUGH WE CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE THEIR REVERSE
IN VAIN OUR PROTECTOR AND HIS PARTIZANS SOUGHT TO CONCEAL THIS TRUTH IN VAIN DAY AFTER DAY HE APPOINTED A PERIOD FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE NEW LAWS CONCERNING HEREDITARY RANK AND PRIVILEGE
AT THE MULTITUDE OF EVILS THAT GATHERED ROUND US MUST HE TAX THE LANDED INTEREST TO ASSIST OUR COMMERCIAL POPULATION TO DO THIS HE MUST GAIN THE FAVOUR OF THE CHIEF LAND HOLDERS THE NOBILITY OF THE COUNTRY
MARBLE HALLS AND INFINITE WEALTH IS NOW A TOMB THE TENT OF THE ARAB IS FALLEN IN THE SANDS AND HIS HORSE SPURNS THE GROUND UNBRIDLED AND UNSADDLED THE VOICE OF LAMENTATION FILLS THE VALLEY OF CASHMERE
BROBDIGNAGIANS BUT WE ON OUR STABLE ABODE COULD NOT BE HURT IN LIFE OR LIMB BY THESE ERUPTIONS OF NATURE WE COULD NOT FEAR WE DID NOT YET A FEELING OF AWE
THE EARTH HAS SHED HER BEAUTY IN OBEDIENCE TO THY COMMAND THE FRAIL BALLOON DARES NO LONGER SAIL ON THE AGITATED AIR THY MINISTERS THE CLOUDS DELUGE THE LAND WITH RAIN
AND ITS INCREASE THROUGH FOREIGN EMIGRATION WAS LESS FELT THAN WITH US THE PANIC STRUCK APPEARED OF MORE INJURY THAN DISEASE AND ITS NATURAL
WE MUST QUAKE SHE COULD TAKE OUR GLOBE
IF THEY HAD NOW ENJOYED WHAT THEY BEFORE CALLED A NECESSARY THE EASE OF A CARRIAGE CHAIRS AS IN OLDEN TIME AND INDIAN PALANQUINS WERE INTRODUCED FOR THE INFIRM
GERMANY ITALY AND SPAIN WERE INTERPOSED WALLS YET WITHOUT A BREACH BETWEEN US AND THE PLAGUE OUR VESSELS TRULY WERE THE SPORT OF WINDS AND WAVES EVEN AS GULLIVER
OUR VERY CITIES ARE WASTED BY THEE ALAS WHAT WILL BECOME OF US IT SEEMS AS IF THE GIANT WAVES OF OCEAN AND VAST ARMS OF THE SEA WERE ABOUT TO WRENCH THE DEEP ROOTED ISLAND FROM ITS CENTRE AND CAST IT
EARNEST PLEADINGS AND BENEVOLENT ELOQUENCE WERE IRRESISTIBLE TO GIVE UP THEIR PLEASURE GROUNDS TO THE AGRICULTURIST TO DIMINISH SENSIBLY THE NUMBER OF HORSES KEPT FOR THE PURPOSES OF LUXURY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
IN THE SAME WAY INDIVIDUALS MAY ESCAPE NINETY NINE TIMES AND RECEIVE THE DEATH BLOW AT THE HUNDREDTH BECAUSE BODIES ARE SOMETIMES
AND NOT FEAR ITS GROWTH AND MATURITY THUS WE BEGAN TO FEEL WITH REGARD TO MANY VISAGED DEATH LET LOOSE ON THE CHOSEN DISTRICTS OF OUR FAIR HABITATION
THEY FLOURISH NURSED BY THEE WHY DOST THOU HOWL THUS O WIND BY DAY AND BY NIGHT FOR FOUR LONG MONTHS THY ROARINGS HAVE NOT CEASED THE SHORES OF THE SEA ARE STREWN WITH WRECKS
YET TO THE HONOUR OF THE ENGLISH BE IT RECORDED THAT ALTHOUGH NATURAL
AND ABOVE ALL WITH REGARD TO THE PLAGUE WE FEARED THE COMING SUMMER NATIONS BORDERING ON THE ALREADY INFECTED COUNTRIES BEGAN TO ENTER UPON SERIOUS PLANS FOR THE BETTER KEEPING OUT OF THE ENEMY
WAS STILL UNSETTLED OF HOW THIS EPIDEMIC WAS GENERATED AND INCREASED IF INFECTION DEPENDED UPON THE AIR THE AIR WAS SUBJECT TO INFECTION
THE THORN GROWS WITH THE ROSE THE POISON TREE AND THE CINNAMON MINGLE THEIR BOUGHS
MANY OF OUR VISITORS LEFT US THOSE WHOSE HOMES WERE FAR IN THE SOUTH FLED DELIGHTEDLY FROM OUR NORTHERN WINTER AND SOUGHT THEIR NATIVE LAND SECURE OF PLENTY EVEN AFTER THEIR FEARFUL
FAMILIES BRED IN OPULENCE AND LUXURY WERE REDUCED TO BEGGARY THE VERY STATE OF PEACE IN WHICH WE GLORIED WAS INJURIOUS THERE WERE NO MEANS OF EMPLOYING THE IDLE
THE ENGLISH SPIRIT AWOKE TO ITS FULL ACTIVITY AND AS IT HAD EVER DONE SET ITSELF TO RESIST THE EVIL AND TO STAND IN THE BREACH WHICH DISEASED NATURE HAD SUFFERED CHAOS AND DEATH TO MAKE
HAS BEEN BROUGHT BY SHIPS TO ONE SEA PORT TOWN YET THE VERY PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT IT THERE WERE INCAPABLE OF COMMUNICATING IT IN A TOWN MORE FORTUNATELY SITUATED BUT HOW ARE WE TO JUDGE OF AIRS
EVEN THE SOURCE OF COLONIES WAS DRIED UP FOR IN NEW HOLLAND
IT WOULD EXPIRE IN THESE CLIMES IT DRINKS THE DARK BLOOD OF THE INHABITANT OF THE SOUTH BUT IT NEVER FEASTS ON THE PALE FACED CELT IF
RIVERS FORSAKE THEIR BANKS THE WILD TORRENT TEARS UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH PLAIN AND WOOD AND VERDANT DELL ARE DESPOILED OF THEIR LOVELINESS
HIS INHERITANCE ON EARTH CUT OFF I REMEMBER AFTER HAVING WITNESSED THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF A FIRE I COULD NOT EVEN BEHOLD A SMALL ONE IN A STOVE WITHOUT A SENSATION OF FEAR
DEGRADATION OF HUMANITY WAS INTRODUCED INTO EVERY HEART NATURE OUR MOTHER AND OUR FRIEND HAD TURNED ON US A BROW OF MENACE SHE SHEWED US PLAINLY THAT THOUGH SHE PERMITTED US TO ASSIGN HER LAWS AND SUBDUE HER APPARENT POWERS
IN VAIN HE ENDEAVOURED TO REPRESENT THE EVIL AS PARTIAL AND TEMPORARY THESE DISASTERS CAME HOME TO SO MANY BOSOMS AND THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WERE CARRIED SO
RENTS WERE UNPAID AND THEIR REMITTANCES FAILED THEM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THESE CROWDS OF WRETCHED PERISHING CREATURES LATE NURSLINGS OF LUXURY
IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS WE CALL OURSELVES LORDS OF THE CREATION WIELDERS OF THE ELEMENTS MASTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH AND WE ALLEGE IN EXCUSE OF THIS ARROGANCE THAT THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL IS DESTROYED
WITH A PEN OF IRON IMPRESSED BY FIRE WOVEN IN THE CLOUDS STAMPED ON THE VERY FRONT OF THE UNIVERSE THE ENGLISH
CALM WAS NOW RESTORED TO THE METROPOLIS AND TO THE POPULOUS CITIES BEFORE DRIVEN TO DESPERATION AND WE RETURNED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF DISTANT CALAMITIES WONDERING IF THE FUTURE WOULD BRING ANY ALLEVIATION
O YES IT WOULD COUNTRYMEN FEAR NOT IN THE STILL UNCULTIVATED WILDS OF AMERICA WHAT WONDER THAT AMONG ITS OTHER GIANT DESTROYERS PLAGUE SHOULD BE NUMBERED
WHETHER THOU COMEST DESTROYING FROM THE EAST OR PREGNANT WITH ELEMENTARY LIFE FROM THE WEST THEE THE CLOUDS OBEY THE SUN IS SUBSERVIENT TO THEE THE SHORELESS
THAT THERE CAN BE NO LONGER A DOUBT OF THE PLAGUE HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED AT LEGHORN GENOA AND MARSEILLES NO WORD OF COMMENT FOLLOWED
OUR OWN DISTRESSES THOUGH THEY WERE OCCASIONED BY THE FICTITIOUS RECIPROCITY OF COMMERCE ENCREASED IN DUE PROPORTION BANKERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS
BETWIXT THE RANKS THE PROUD COMMANDERS RIDE GLITT'RING WITH GOLD AND VESTS IN PURPLE DYED HERE
ATTENDED THUS HE TAKES A NEIGHB'RING HEIGHT THE CROWDING TROOPS ABOUT THEIR GEN'RAL STAND ALL UNDER ARMS AND WAIT HIS HIGH COMMAND THEN THUS THE LOFTY PRINCE
LONG HAST THOU KNOWN NOR NEED I TO RECORD THE WANTON SALLIES OF MY WAND'RING LORD OF EV'RY LATIAN FAIR WHOM JOVE MISLED
THUS WHILE HE RAVES FROM HIS WIDE NOSTRILS FLIES A FIERY STEAM
BY WHOSE COMMAND THE TRUCE WAS BROKEN AND WHOSE LANCE EMBRUED WITH TROJAN BLOOD
AND AS THE CHARIOT ROLL'D ALONG THE PLAIN LIGHT FROM THE GROUND HE LEAPT AND SEIZ'D THE REIN THUS HUNG IN AIR HE STILL RETAIN'D HIS HOLD THE COURSERS FRIGHTED AND THEIR COURSE CONTROLL'D THE LANCE OF TURNUS REACH'D HIM AS HE HUNG AND PIERC'D HIS PLATED ARMS
THEY ROLL TO SEA WITH UNRESISTED FORCE AND DOWN THE ROCKS PRECIPITATE THEIR COURSE NOT WITH LESS RAGE THE RIVAL HEROES TAKE THEIR DIFF'RENT WAYS NOR LESS DESTRUCTION MAKE
THUS ARE MY FOES REWARDED BY MY HAND THUS MAY THEY BUILD THEIR TOWN AND THUS ENJOY THE LAND
SHE TEARS WITH BOTH HER HANDS HER PURPLE VEST THEN ROUND A BEAM A RUNNING NOOSE SHE TIED AND FASTEN'D BY THE NECK OBSCENELY DIED SOON AS THE FATAL NEWS BY FAME WAS BLOWN
AND CLOUDS OF MISSIVE ARMS OBSCURE THE SKY ADVANCING TO THE FRONT THE HERO STANDS AND STRETCHING OUT TO HEAV'N HIS PIOUS HANDS ATTESTS THE GODS ASSERTS HIS INNOCENCE
AS WHEN A WHIRLWIND RUSHING TO THE SHORE FROM THE MID OCEAN DRIVES THE WAVES BEFORE THE PAINFUL HIND WITH HEAVY HEART FORESEES THE FLATTED FIELDS AND SLAUGHTER OF THE TREES
HIS LANCE HE THREW THE WINGED WEAPON WHISTLING IN THE WIND CAME DRIVING ON NOR MISS'D THE MARK DESIGN'D AT ONCE THE CORNEL RATTLED IN THE SKIES AT ONCE TUMULTUOUS SHOUTS AND CLAMORS RISE
WITHIN THY BREAST SINCE THOU ART ALL MY HOPE MY SICKLY MIND'S REPOSE MY SINKING AGE'S PROP SINCE ON THE SAFETY OF THY LIFE ALONE DEPENDS LATINUS AND THE LATIAN THRONE REFUSE ME NOT THIS ONE
AENEAS AUTHOR OF THE ROMAN LINE AND BY HIS SIDE ASCANIUS TOOK HIS PLACE THE SECOND HOPE OF ROME'S IMMORTAL RACE ADORN'D IN WHITE A REV'REND PRIEST APPEARS AND OFF'RINGS TO THE FLAMING ALTARS BEARS
NOT THO THE CIRCLING SEAS SHOULD BREAK THEIR BOUND O'ERFLOW THE SHORES OR SAP THE SOLID GROUND NOT THO THE LAMPS OF HEAV'N THEIR SPHERES FORSAKE HURL'D DOWN AND HISSING IN THE NETHER LAKE
THEN TURNING TO THE HERALD THUS PURSUES GO GREET THE
THE SMOKING HORSES RUN WITH LOOSEN'D REINS SHE STEERS A VARIOUS COURSE AMONG THE FOES NOW HERE NOW THERE HER CONQU'RING BROTHER SHOWS NOW WITH A STRAIGHT
WITH FURY NOT UNLIKE NOR LESS DISDAIN EXULTING TURNUS FLIES ALONG THE PLAIN HIS SMOKING HORSES AT THEIR UTMOST SPEED HE LASHES ON AND URGES O'ER THE DEAD THEIR FETLOCKS RUN WITH BLOOD
MAD WITH HER ANGUISH IMPOTENT TO BEAR THE MIGHTY GRIEF SHE LOATHES THE VITAL AIR SHE CALLS HERSELF THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS ILL AND OWNS THE DIRE EFFECTS OF HER UNGOVERN'D WILL
THESE HIS LANCE REACHES OVER THOSE HE ROLLS HIS RAPID CAR AND CRUSHES OUT THEIR SOULS IN VAIN THE VANQUISH'D FLY THE VICTOR SENDS THE DEAD MEN'S WEAPONS AT THEIR LIVING FRIENDS
HE SHEATH'D HIS LIMBS IN ARMS A TEMPER'D MASS OF GOLDEN METAL THOSE AND MOUNTAIN BRASS THEN TO HIS HEAD HIS GLITT'RING HELM HE TIED
OF HIS RICH ARMOR AND UNCROWN HIS HEAD PRIEST CORYNAEUS ARM'D HIS BETTER HAND FROM HIS OWN ALTAR WITH A BLAZING BRAND AND AS EBUSUS WITH A THUND'RING PACE ADVANC'D TO BATTLE DASH'D IT ON HIS FACE
AND WITH UNERRING AIM AND UTMOST VIGOR THREW AENEAS SAW IT COME AND STOOPING LOW BENEATH HIS BUCKLER SHUNN'D THE THREAT'NING BLOW
AND THRO HIS BODY DROVE THEN WITH A SCORNFUL SMILE THE VICTOR CRIES THE GODS HAVE FOUND A FITTER SACRIFICE
AND THUS WITH PIOUS PRAY'RS THE GODS ADOR'D ALL SEEING SUN AND THOU AUSONIAN SOIL FOR WHICH I HAVE SUSTAIN'D SO LONG A TOIL THOU KING OF HEAV'N AND THOU THE QUEEN OF AIR
BENEATH THE WALLS THEY MEASURE OUT THE SPACE THEN SACRED ALTARS REAR ON SODS OF GRASS WHERE WITH RELIGIOUS THEIR COMMON GODS THEY PLACE
THE STEEL REMAINS NO READIER WAY HE FOUND TO DRAW THE WEAPON THAN T INLARGE THE WOUND EAGER OF FIGHT IMPATIENT OF DELAY HE BEGS AND HIS UNWILLING FRIENDS OBEY
AND SILENT PRAISE OF HEALING ARTS BEFORE PHOEBEAN BAYS PROPP'D ON HIS LANCE THE PENSIVE HERO STOOD AND HEARD AND SAW UNMOV'D THE MOURNING CROWD
BUT IF MY JUSTER ARMS PREVAIL IN FIGHT
WITH LIKE IMPETUOUS RAGE THE PRINCE APPEARS BEFORE HIS DOUBLED FRONT
OR IF IT WERE DISCHARGE THE CRIME ON ME SHE SAID AND SAILING ON THE WINGED WIND LEFT THE SAD NYMPH SUSPENDED IN HER MIND
NOW STUDIOUS OF THE SIGHT A NUM'ROUS THRONG OF EITHER SEX PROMISCUOUS OLD AND YOUNG SWARM THE TOWN
THIS SON OF DOLON BORE HIS GRANDSIRE'S NAME BUT
AND ALL THOSE POW'RS ATTEST AND ALL THEIR NAMES WHATEVER CHANCE BEFALL ON EITHER SIDE NO TERM OF TIME THIS UNION SHALL DIVIDE NO FORCE NO FORTUNE SHALL MY VOWS UNBIND OR SHAKE THE STEADFAST TENOR OF MY MIND
VAUNTING IN THE FIELD
THE SIRES OF THESE ORYTHIA SENT FROM FAR TO GRACE PILUMNUS WHEN HE WENT TO WAR THE DRIFTS OF THRACIAN SNOWS WERE SCARCE SO WHITE NOR NORTHERN WINDS IN FLEETNESS MATCH'D THEIR FLIGHT
BOUNDING FROM THE SEA FROM OUT THEIR FLAMING NOSTRILS BREATH'D THE DAY WHEN NOW THE TROJAN AND RUTULIAN GUARD IN FRIENDLY LABOR JOIN'D
UNSEEN SHE STANDS TEMP'RING THE MIXTURE WITH HER HEAV'NLY HANDS AND POURS IT IN A BOWL
AND IN EQUAL FIGHT PREVAIL'D THEIR LIFELESS TRUNKS HE LEAVES UPON THE PLACE THEIR HEADS DISTILLING GORE HIS CHARIOT GRACE THREE COLD ON EARTH THE TROJAN HERO THREW
OR CHANGE IT RATHER FOR IMMORTAL FAME SUCCEEDING TO THE GODS FROM WHENCE HE CAME BUT YOU A SERVILE AND INGLORIOUS BAND FOR FOREIGN LORDS SHALL SOW YOUR NATIVE LAND
HEAR AND OBEY YE TROJAN BANDS WITHOUT THE LEAST DELAY JOVE IS WITH US AND WHAT I HAVE DECREED REQUIRES OUR UTMOST VIGOR AND OUR SPEED YOUR INSTANT ARMS AGAINST THE TOWN PREPARE THE SOURCE OF MISCHIEF AND THE SEAT OF WAR
JOVE COULD'ST THOU VIEW AND NOT AVERT THY SIGHT TWO JARRING NATIONS JOIN'D IN CRUEL FIGHT WHOM LEAGUES OF LASTING LOVE SO SHORTLY SHALL UNITE AENEAS FIRST RUTULIAN SUCRO FOUND
SO WHERE RESISTLESS TURNUS TAKES HIS COURSE THE SCATTER'D SQUADRONS BEND BEFORE HIS FORCE HIS CREST OF HORSES HAIR IS BLOWN BEHIND BY ADVERSE AIR AND RUSTLES IN THE WIND
THIS ARM UNAIDED SHALL ASSERT YOUR RIGHT THEN IF MY PROSTRATE BODY PRESS THE PLAIN TO HIM THE CROWN AND BEAUTEOUS BRIDE REMAIN TO WHOM THE KING SEDATELY THUS REPLIED BRAVE YOUTH
IN PUREST WHITE THE PRIESTS THEIR HEADS ATTIRE AND LIVING WATERS BEAR AND HOLY FIRE AND O'ER THEIR LINEN HOODS AND SHADED HAIR LONG TWISTED WREATHS OF SACRED VERYAIN WEAR IN ORDER ISSUING FROM THE TOWN APPEARS
THE BROAD AX ENTERS WITH A CRASHING SOUND AND CLEAVES THE CHIN WITH ONE CONTINUED WOUND WARM BLOOD AND MINGLED BRAINS BESMEAR HIS ARMS AROUND
WHICH PRESENT TO THEIR EYES INSPIRES NEW COURAGE AND A GLAD SURPRISE FOR SUDDEN IN THE FIERY TRACTS ABOVE
SEA BORN MESSAPUS WITH ATINAS HEADS THE LATIN SQUADRONS AND TO BATTLE LEADS THEY STRIKE THEY PUSH THEY THRONG THE SCANTY SPACE RESOLV'D ON DEATH IMPATIENT OF DISGRACE AND WHERE ONE FALLS ANOTHER FILLS HIS PLACE
AND HEARD THE HOSTILE SOUND AND FLED FOR FEAR
WHICH TO HIS NAKED HEART PURSUED THE COURSE NOR COULD HIS PLATED SHIELD SUSTAIN THE FORCE
NINE BROTHERS IN A GOODLY BAND THERE STOOD BORN OF ARCADIAN MIX'D WITH TUSCAN BLOOD
EAGER OF ACTION AND DEMAND THE FIGHT THEN KING TOLUMNIUS
A PORKET AND A LAMB THAT NEVER SUFFER'D SHEARS THEN TO THE RISING SUN HE TURNS HIS EYES AND STREWS THE BEASTS DESIGN'D FOR SACRIFICE WITH SALT AND MEAL WITH LIKE OFFICIOUS CARE
TWELVE GOLDEN BEAMS AROUND HIS TEMPLES PLAY TO MARK HIS LINEAGE FROM THE GOD OF DAY TWO SNOWY COURSERS TURNUS CHARIOT YOKE AND IN HIS HAND TWO MASSY SPEARS HE SHOOK THEN ISSUED FROM THE CAMP IN ARMS DIVINE
THE PRINCE ENCOUNTER'D HIM IN FULL CAREER AND AT HIS TEMPLES AIM'D THE DEADLY SPEAR SO FATALLY THE FLYING WEAPON SPED THAT THRO HIS HELM IT PIERC'D HIS HEAD
WHAT SHOULD HE DO NOR ARTS NOR ARMS AVAIL AND VARIOUS CARES IN VAIN HIS MIND ASSAIL
THOSE FRUITFUL FIELDS YOUR FIGHTING FATHERS GAIN'D WHICH HAVE SO LONG THEIR LAZY SONS SUSTAIN'D WITH WORDS LIKE THESE SHE CARRIED HER DESIGN
WITH GENTLE TOUCHES HE PERFORMS HIS PART THIS WAY AND THAT SOLICITING THE DART AND EXERCISES ALL HIS HEAV'NLY ART ALL SOFT'NING SIMPLES KNOWN OF SOV'REIGN USE HE PRESSES OUT AND POURS THEIR NOBLE JUICE
THEN WITH A CLOSE EMBRACE HE STRAIN'D HIS SON AND KISSING THRO HIS HELMET THUS BEGUN MY SON FROM MY EXAMPLE LEARN THE WAR IN CAMPS TO SUFFER AND IN FIELDS TO DARE BUT HAPPIER CHANCE THAN MINE ATTEND THY CARE
THEN CRIED O POND'ROUS SPOIL OF ACTOR SLAIN AND NEVER YET BY TURNUS TOSS'D IN VAIN FAIL NOT THIS DAY THY WONTED FORCE BUT GO SENT BY THIS HAND TO PIERCE THE TROJAN FOE
AND YOUNG ASCANIUS WEEPING BY HIS SIDE CONDUCT HIM TO HIS TENT SCARCE CAN HE REAR HIS LIMBS FROM EARTH SUPPORTED ON HIS SPEAR
PROUDLY HE BELLOWS AND PRELUDES THE FIGHT HE TRIES HIS GORING HORNS AGAINST A TREE AND MEDITATES HIS ABSENT ENEMY HE PUSHES AT THE WINDS HE DIGS THE STRAND WITH HIS BLACK HOOFS AND SPURNS THE YELLOW SAND
WITH SPEARS AFAR WITH SWORDS AT HAND THEY STRIKE AND ZEAL OF SLAUGHTER FIRES THEIR SOULS ALIKE LIKE THEM THEIR DAUNTLESS MEN MAINTAIN THE FIELD AND HEARTS ARE PIERC'D UNKNOWING HOW TO YIELD
THE FAITHLESS TURNUS OWE THUS WHILE HE SPOKE UNMINDFUL OF DEFENSE A WINGED ARROW STRUCK THE PIOUS PRINCE BUT WHETHER FROM SOME HUMAN HAND IT CAME OR HOSTILE GOD IS LEFT UNKNOWN BY FAME NO HUMAN HAND OR HOSTILE GOD WAS FOUND
THUS WHEN THE SWAIN WITHIN A HOLLOW ROCK INVADES THE BEES WITH SUFFOCATING SMOKE THEY RUN AROUND OR LABOR ON THEIR WINGS DISUS'D TO FLIGHT AND SHOOT THEIR SLEEPY STINGS
AND LOATH'D THE HARD CONDITIONS OF THE STRIFE
THE HISSING SHAFTS WITHIN THE TRENCH ALIGHT AN UNDISTINGUISH'D NOISE ASCENDS THE SKY
SINCERELY YOURS AND FREE FROM FRAUDFUL ART THE GODS BY SIGNS HAVE MANIFESTLY SHOWN NO PRINCE ITALIAN BORN SHOULD HEIR MY THRONE
THIS ARM THIS LANCE CAN WELL DISPUTE THE PRIZE AND THE BLOOD FOLLOWS WHERE THE WEAPON FLIES HIS GODDESS MOTHER IS NOT NEAR TO SHROUD THE FLYING COWARD WITH AN EMPTY CLOUD BUT NOW THE QUEEN WHO FEAR'D FOR TURNUS LIFE
NOW WITH A WHEELING FLIGHT SHE TURNS AND BENDS BUT SHUNS THE SINGLE FIGHT
O'ERTHREW NOR PHOEBUS COULD THEIR FATE PREVENT
WHEN THUS IN PUBLIC VIEW THE PEACE WAS TIED WITH SOLEMN VOWS AND SWORN ON EITHER SIDE ALL DUES PERFORM'D WHICH HOLY RITES REQUIRE THE VICTIM BEASTS ARE SLAIN BEFORE THE FIRE
THIS IS WHAT MY FREQUENT VOWS REQUIR'D YE GODS I TAKE YOUR OMEN AND OBEY ADVANCE MY FRIENDS AND CHARGE I LEAD THE WAY THESE ARE THE FOREIGN FOES WHOSE IMPIOUS BAND
WHOM NOT THE GRECIAN POW'RS NOR GREAT SUBVERTER OF THE TROJAN TOW'RS WERE DOOM'D TO KILL WHILE HEAV'N PROLONG'D HIS DATE
IT REACH'D HIS HEART NOR NEEDS A SECOND THRUST NOW TURNUS AT TWO BLOWS TWO BRETHREN SLEW FIRST FROM HIS HORSE FIERCE AMYCUS HE THREW THEN LEAPING ON THE GROUND ON FOOT ASSAIL'D
BOTH ARMIES URGES TO THEIR MUTUAL FATE WITH IMPIOUS HASTE THEIR ALTARS ARE O'ERTURN'D THE SACRIFICE HALF BROIL'D AND HALF UNBURN'D THICK STORMS OF STEEL FROM EITHER ARMY FLY
AND ROUND THE LISTED SPACE EACH MAN IN ORDER FILLS HIS PROPER PLACE RECLINING ON THEIR AMPLE SHIELDS THEY STAND AND FIX THEIR POINTED LANCES IN THE SAND
AND SEEKS HIS FOE AND CALLS BY NAME ALOUD HE RUNS WITHIN A NARROWER RING AND TRIES TO STOP THE CHARIOT BUT THE CHARIOT FLIES
WHICH WITH SUCH FORCE HE BRANDISH'D IN HIS HAND
BOTH EQUAL BOTH UNCONQUER'D SHALL REMAIN JOIN'D IN THEIR LAWS THEIR LANDS AND THEIR ABODES I ASK BUT ALTARS FOR MY WEARY GODS THE CARE OF THOSE RELIGIOUS RITES BE MINE THE CROWN TO KING LATINUS I RESIGN
IN THESE SAD ACCENTS GAVE HER SORROW BREATH O TURNUS I ADJURE THEE BY THESE TEARS
CRUSH'D WITH THE WEIGHT OF AN UNWIELDY STONE BETWIXT THE WHEELS HE FELL THE WHEELS THAT BORE HIS LIVING LOAD HIS DYING BODY TORE
GIVE ME TO TEAR HIS CORSLET FROM HIS BREAST AND FROM THAT EUNUCH HEAD TO REND THE CREST DRAGG'D IN THE DUST HIS FRIZZLED HAIR TO SOIL
BUT SCARCELY TOUCH'D WITH TENDER HANDS MOVES UP AND FOLLOWS OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HEALTH AND VIGOR ARE AT ONCE RESTOR'D
THE PEOPLE SHALL BE SLAVES
THIS ONLY PRAY'R TO WAIVE THE COMBAT AND PURSUE THE WAR WHATEVER CHANCE ATTENDS THIS FATAL STRIFE THINK IT INCLUDES IN THINE AMATA'S LIFE I CANNOT LIVE A SLAVE OR SEE MY THRONE USURP'D BY STRANGERS OR A TROJAN SON
A CLOUD OF BLINDING DUST IS RAIS'D AROUND LABORS BENEATH THEIR FEET THE TREMBLING GROUND NOW TURNUS POSTED ON A HILL FROM FAR BEHELD THE PROGRESS OF THE MOVING WAR WITH HIM THE LATINS VIEW'D THE COVER'D PLAINS
AIM'D AT THE MIDMOST OF THE FRIENDLY CREW A PASSAGE THRO THE JOINTED ARMS IT FOUND JUST WHERE THE BELT WAS TO THE BODY BOUND AND STRUCK THE GENTLE YOUTH EXTENDED ON THE GROUND
AND FIRST THE FOOTSTEPS OF A GOD HE FOUND ARMS ARMS HE CRIES THE SWORD AND SHIELD PREPARE AND SEND THE WILLING CHIEF RENEW'D TO WAR THIS IS NO MORTAL WORK NO CURE OF MINE NOR ART'S EFFECT
AND TUSCAN ARMY COUNT EM AS THEY STAND UNDAUNTED TO THE BATTLE IF WE GO SCARCE EV'RY SECOND MAN WILL SHARE A FOE TURNUS T IS TRUE IN THIS UNEQUAL STRIFE SHALL LOSE WITH HONOR HIS DEVOTED LIFE
GLAUCUS AND LADES OF THE LYCIAN CREW BOTH TAUGHT TO FIGHT ON FOOT IN BATTLE JOIN'D OR MOUNT THE COURSER THAT OUTSTRIPS THE WIND
AT ONCE HIS ARMS AND COURSERS HE REQUIRES THEN WITH A LEAP HIS LOFTY CHARIOT GAINS AND WITH A READY HAND ASSUMES THE REINS HE DRIVES IMPETUOUS AND WHERE'ER HE GOES HE LEAVES BEHIND A LANE OF SLAUGHTER'D FOES
AND SOON SEDUC'D TO CHANGE WHAT HE SO WELL DESIGN'D TO BREAK THE SOLEMN LEAGUE SO LONG DESIR'D NOR FINISH WHAT HIS FATES AND THOSE OF TROY REQUIR'D
TO WHOM SATURNIA THUS THY TEARS ARE LATE HASTE SNATCH HIM IF HE CAN BE SNATCH'D FROM FATE NEW TUMULTS KINDLE VIOLATE THE TRUCE
AFTER THESE HE KILL'D WHO LONG HAD SHUNN'D THE DANGERS OF THE FIELD ON LERNA'S LAKE A SILENT LIFE HE LED AND WITH HIS NETS AND ANGLE EARN'D HIS BREAD NOR POMPOUS CARES NOR PALACES HE KNEW
HE SAID AND STRIDING ISSUED ON THE PLAIN ANTEUS AND MNESTHEUS AND A NUM'ROUS TRAIN ATTEND HIS STEPS THE REST THEIR WEAPONS TAKE AND CROWDING TO THE FIELD
SINCE CALL'D ALBANO BY SUCCEEDING FAME BUT THEN AN EMPTY HILL WITHOUT A NAME
BLACK VAPORS ISSUING FROM THE VENT INVOLVE THE SKY BUT FATE AND ENVIOUS FORTUNE NOW PREPARE TO PLUNGE THE LATINS IN THE LAST DESPAIR THE QUEEN WHO SAW THE FOES INVADE THE TOWN AND
AND WHEN THEY BOUND THE GORE AND GATH'RING DUST ARE DASH'D AROUND THAMYRIS AND PHOLUS MASTERS OF THE WAR HE KILL'D AT HAND BUT STHENELUS AFAR FROM FAR THE SONS OF IMBRACUS HE SLEW
WHY PUT I NOT AN END TO THIS DEBATE STILL UNRESOLV'D AND STILL A SLAVE TO FATE IF TURNUS DEATH A LASTING PEACE CAN GIVE WHY SHOULD I NOT PROCURE IT WHILST YOU LIVE SHOULD I TO DOUBTFUL ARMS YOUR YOUTH BETRAY WHAT WOULD MY KINSMEN THE RUTULIANS SAY
HIS STARTING STEEDS TO SHUN THE GLITT'RING SWORD PAW DOWN HIS TRAMPLED LIMBS FORGETFUL OF THEIR LORD
AND THUS HIS BOASTED SKILL IMPARTS
ALL CLAIMS ALL QUESTIONS OF DEBATE SHALL CEASE
THE WRATHFUL YOUTH DISDAINING THE RELIEF WITH INTERMITTING SOBS THUS VENTS HIS GRIEF THE CARE O BEST OF FATHERS WHICH YOU TAKE FOR MY CONCERNS AT MY DESIRE FORSAKE PERMIT ME NOT TO LANGUISH OUT MY DAYS BUT MAKE THE BEST EXCHANGE OF LIFE FOR PRAISE
EMBRACE AND MEET THEIR ARDOR IN THE MIDDLE SPACE THE TROJANS TUSCANS AND ARCADIAN LINE WITH EQUAL COURAGE OBVIATE THEIR DESIGN PEACE LEAVES THE VIOLATED FIELDS AND HATE
ALL POW'RS OF OCEAN ALL ETHEREAL GODS HEAR AND BEAR RECORD IF I FALL IN FIELD OR RECREANT IN THE FIGHT TO TURNUS YIELD MY TROJANS SHALL ENCREASE EVANDER'S TOWN
THE TROJAN AND RUTULIAN TROOPS NO MORE SHALL DYE WITH MUTUAL BLOOD THE LATIAN SHORE OUR SINGLE SWORDS THE QUARREL SHALL DECIDE AND TO THE VICTOR BE THE BEAUTEOUS BRIDE HE SAID AND STRIDING ON WITH SPEEDY PACE HE SOUGHT
I AND MY SUBJECTS FEEL AND YOU HAVE HAD YOUR SHARE TWICE VANQUISH'D WHILE IN BLOODY FIELDS WE STRIVE SCARCE IN OUR WALLS WE KEEP OUR HOPES ALIVE
CLEANSE THE POLLUTED PLACE WITH PURGING FIRES HE FINISH'D AND ONE SOUL INSPIRING ALL FORM'D IN A WEDGE THE FOOT APPROACH THE WALL WITHOUT THE TOWN
AND THERE MESSAPUS BORN OF SEED DIVINE
PROPITIOUS NOW AND RECONCIL'D BY PRAY'R THOU GOD OF WAR WHOSE UNRESISTED SWAY THE LABORS AND EVENTS OF ARMS OBEY YE LIVING FOUNTAINS AND YE RUNNING FLOODS
THAT FOR HIS LOVE HE PROFFER'D TO BESTOW HIS TUNEFUL HARP AND HIS UNERRING BOW
THE LAKES AND O'ER THEIR HEADS HIS SOUNDING PINIONS SHAKES THEN STOOPING ON THE FAIREST OF THE TRAIN
BUT WHILE HE LAGS AND LABORS IN HIS FLIGHT BEHOLD THE DASTARD FOWL RETURN ANEW AND WITH UNITED FORCE THE FOE PURSUE CLAM'ROUS AROUND THE ROYAL HAWK THEY FLY AND THICK'NING IN A CLOUD O'ERSHADE THE SKY
SOME WOULD EXCLUDE THEIR FOES AND SOME ADMIT THEIR FRIENDS THE HELPLESS KING IS HURRIED IN THE THRONG AND
BY HELL BELOW AND BY THAT UPPER GOD WHOSE THUNDER SIGNS THE PEACE WHO SEALS IT WITH HIS NOD SO LET LATONA'S DOUBLE OFFSPRING HEAR AND DOUBLE FRONTED JANUS WHAT I SWEAR I TOUCH THE SACRED ALTARS TOUCH THE FLAMES
WITH STREAMS THAT ISSUE FROM THE BLEEDING TRUNK WHILE HE TRIUMPHS AND WHILE THE TROJANS YIELD THE WOUNDED PRINCE IS FORC'D TO LEAVE THE FIELD
HE TURN'D AND HELD AGAINST HIS THREAT'NING FOE HIS AMPLE SHIELD THEN CALL'D FOR AID BUT WHILE HE CRIED IN VAIN THE CHARIOT BORE HIM BACKWARD ON THE PLAIN HE LIES REVERS'D THE VICTOR KING DESCENDS
THE MORE HE LOOK'D THE MORE HE FED THE FIRE REVENGE AND JEALOUS RAGE AND SECRET SPITE ROLL IN HIS BREAST AND ROUSE HIM TO THE FIGHT
HIS HOLY PONIARD IN HIS BREAST WHILE PODALIRIUS WITH HIS SWORD PURSUED THE SHEPHERD ALSUS THRO THE FLYING CROWD SWIFTLY HE TURNS AND AIMS A DEADLY BLOW FULL ON THE FRONT OF HIS UNWARY FOE
HIS VENERABLE BEARD BESMEARS AND SORDID DUST DEFORMS HIS SILVER HAIRS AND MUCH HE BLAMES THE SOFTNESS OF HIS MIND OBNOXIOUS TO THE CHARMS OF WOMANKIND
BOTH HOSTS THEIR BROKEN TROOPS UNITE IN EQUAL RANKS AND MIX IN MORTAL FIGHT
THEN THUS THE GODDESS OF THE SKIES BESPOKE WITH SIGHS AND TEARS THE GODDESS OF THE LAKE KING TURNUS SISTER ONCE A LOVELY MAID ERE TO THE LUST OF LAWLESS JOVE BETRAY'D
HIS COURSERS OF THE THRACIAN RACE AT HIS APPROACH THEY TOSS THEIR HEADS ON HIGH
MEANTIME THE QUEEN OF HEAV'N BEHELD THE SIGHT
AND GOES WITH GODS AVERSE O'ERMATCH'D IN MIGHT TO MEET INEVITABLE DEATH IN FIGHT NOR MUST I BREAK THE TRUCE NOR CAN SUSTAIN THE SIGHT
AND CLOUDS OF CLASHING DARTS OBSCURE THE SKY BRANDS FROM THE FIRE ARE MISSIVE WEAPONS MADE WITH CHARGERS BOWLS AND ALL THE PRIESTLY TRADE LATINUS FRIGHTED HASTENS FROM THE FRAY AND BEARS HIS UNREGARDED GODS AWAY
WHEN THEIR SHORT SIGHS AND THICK'NING SOBS SHE HEARD
OFFICIOUS GROOMS STAND READY BY HIS SIDE AND SOME WITH COMBS THEIR FLOWING MANES DIVIDE AND OTHERS STROKE THEIR CHESTS AND GENTLY SOOTHE THEIR PRIDE
THE DRIVING DUST PROCLAIMS THE DANGER NEAR AND FIRST THEIR FRIENDS AND THEN THEIR FOES APPEAR THEIR FRIENDS RETREAT THEIR FOES PURSUE THE REAR THE CAMP IS FILL'D WITH TERROR AND AFFRIGHT
AS WHEN THE SWAINS THE LIBYAN LION CHASE HE MAKES A SOUR RETREAT NOR MENDS HIS PACE BUT IF THE POINTED JAV'LIN PIERCE HIS SIDE THE LORDLY BEAST RETURNS WITH DOUBLE PRIDE
THEIR RITES AND INJUR'D ALTARS TO REDRESS THEN TO HIS RAGE ABANDONING THE REIN WITH BLOOD AND SLAUGHTER'D BODIES FILLS THE PLAIN WHAT GOD CAN TELL WHAT NUMBERS CAN DISPLAY THE VARIOUS LABORS OF THAT FATAL DAY
DISSEMBLING HER IMMORTAL FORM SHE TOOK CAMERTUS MIEN HIS HABIT AND HIS LOOK A CHIEF OF ANCIENT BLOOD IN ARMS WELL KNOWN WAS HIS GREAT SIRE AND HE HIS GREATER SON HIS SHAPE ASSUM'D AMID THE RANKS SHE RAN
THAT FLYING TURNUS STILL DECLIN'D THE FIGHT THE PRINCE WHOSE PIETY HAD LONG REPELL'D HIS INBORN ARDOR NOW INVADES THE FIELD INVOKES THE POW'RS OF VIOLATED PEACE
HE WRENCHES OUT THE STEEL HE ROARS FOR PAIN HIS SIDES HE LASHES AND ERECTS HIS MANE SO TURNUS FARES HIS EYEBALLS FLASH WITH FIRE THRO HIS WIDE NOSTRILS CLOUDS OF SMOKE EXPIRE
CONFUSION FEAR DISTRACTION AND DISGRACE AND SILENT SHAME ARE SEEN IN EV'RY FACE LATINUS TEARS HIS GARMENTS AS HE GOES BOTH FOR HIS PUBLIC AND HIS PRIVATE WOES WITH FILTH
THE GOD OF BATTLES IN HIS ANGRY MOOD CLASHING HIS SWORD AGAINST HIS BRAZEN SHIELD LET LOOSE THE REINS AND SCOURS ALONG THE FIELD BEFORE THE WIND HIS FIERY COURSERS FLY GROANS THE SAD EARTH
THE FLOW OF CURRENT WILL CAUSE TWO EQUAL OPPOSING ACTIONS TO BE SET UP IN THE BAR ONE WILL EXACTLY OFFSET THE OTHER AND NO MAGNETIC EFFECT WILL BE PRODUCED A RELAY THUS WOUND IS KNOWN AS A DIFFERENTIAL RELAY
WITH AS LITTLE TECHNICALITY AS THE SUBJECT WILL PERMIT THIS EXPLANATION WILL NECESSARILY BE OF SOMEWHAT ELEMENTARY CHARACTER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LAY READER WHOSE INDULGENCE IS ASKED FOR AN OCCASIONAL REITERATION
WITHOUT PRODUCING A SOUND IF THEREFORE THERE BE PLACED IN THE SAME CIRCUIT A REGULAR TELEGRAPH RELAY AND A SPECIAL TELEPHONE AN OPERATOR MAY BY MANIPULATING A KEY OPERATE THE RELAY AND ITS SOUNDER
BUT WHEN THE CURRENT IS CUT OFF THE MAGNETIC EFFECT INSTANTLY CEASES THIS DEVICE IS KNOWN AS AN ELECTROMAGNET AND THE CHARGING AND DISCHARGING OF SUCH A MAGNET MAY OF COURSE BE REPEATED INDEFINITELY
THE LATTER IN EACH CASE HAS IN ITS CIRCUIT A RESISTANCE R TO COMPENSATE FOR THE RESISTANCE OF THE MAIN LINE SO THAT THERE SHALL BE NO INEQUALITIES IN THE CIRCUITS THE ARTIFICIAL LINE AS WELL AS THAT TO WHICH THE TWO COILS ARE JOINED
THE POLAR RELAY RESPONDING WHEN THE POLARITY OF THE CURRENT IS REVERSED WHETHER THE CURRENT BE STRONG OR WEAK AND THE NEUTRAL RELAY RESPONDING WHEN THE LINE CURRENT IS INCREASED REGARDLESS OF ITS POLARITY
IN PRACTICE THIS IS DONE BY MEANS OF A SPECIAL INSTRUMENT KNOWN AS A CONTINUITY PRESERVING TRANSMITTER OR USUALLY AS A TRANSMITTER THIS CONSISTS OF AN ELECTROMAGNET T OPERATED BY A KEY K
THE THEORY OF THE POLARIZED RELAY GENERALLY CALLED POLAR
IN THE ORDINARY WAY CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY SEND TWO MESSAGES OVER ONE LINE IN THE SAME DIRECTION WITH THE SAME CURRENT ONE OPERATOR VARYING ITS STRENGTH AND THE OTHER OPERATOR VARYING ITS POLARITY OR DIRECTION OF FLOW
AND SEPARATE BATTERY THE ARMATURE LEVER L IS LONG PIVOTED IN THE CENTRE AND IS BENT OVER AT THE END
WOULD NOT BE PRACTICABLE BETWEEN A NUMBER OF INTERCOMMUNICATING POINTS EDISON'S PHONOPLEX NORMALLY DOUBLED THE CAPACITY OF TELEGRAPH LINES WHETHER EMPLOYED ON WAY BUSINESS OR THROUGH TRAFFIC
DEPRESSING THE SPRING WHICH MAKES CONTACT WITH THE UPPER SCREW WHICH PLACES THE BATTERY TO THE LINE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY BREAKS THE GROUND CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SPRING AND THE UPTURNED END OF THE LEVER
AS THE READER WILL PROBABLY BE INTERESTED TO LEARN SOMETHING OF THE THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF THIS FASCINATING INVENTION WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO OFFER A BRIEF AND CONDENSED EXPLANATION THEREOF
LET US CONSIDER THE STEARNS SYSTEM AFTER NOTING ONE OTHER PRINCIPLE NAMELY THAT IF MORE THAN ONE PATH IS PRESENTED IN WHICH AN ELECTRIC CURRENT MAY COMPLETE ITS CIRCUIT IT DIVIDES IN PROPORTION TO THE RESISTANCE OF EACH PATH
IN WHICH WILL BE SEEN ON THE LEFT A SIMPLE FORM OF ELECTROMAGNET CONSISTING OF A BAR OF SOFT IRON WOUND AROUND WITH INSULATED WIRE THROUGH WHICH A CURRENT IS FLOWING FROM A BATTERY
SIMULTANEOUSLY AND OF COURSE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FOREGOING ACTIONS THE HOME NEUTRAL RELAY ITSELF MAY HAVE HAD ITS MAGNETISM REVERSED SEVERAL TIMES AND THE SIGNAL THAT IS THE DASH WILL HAVE BEEN MADE
AND ATTACHED TO THE LOWER END OF THIS BENT PIECE IS A POST OR STANDARD TO WHICH THE MAIN BATTERY IS ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED
WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD
IF ANOTHER BATTERY D BE INTRODUCED AT THE DISTANT END OF THE WIRE A THE DIFFERENTIAL OR NEUTRAL RELAY BECOMES ACTIVELY OPERATIVE AS FOLLOWS
CORRESPONDING TO THE SIGNALS TRANSMITTED BUT THIS CURRENT IS TOO WEAK TO AFFECT THE TELEGRAPH RELAY
A CONTACT AND A BACK STOP THE FORMER OF WHICH IS OPENED AND CLOSED BY THE SWINGING PERMANENT MAGNET THUS OPENING AND CLOSING THE LOCAL CIRCUIT
ASSUMING FOR INSTANCE THE BAR TO BE END ON TOWARD THE OBSERVER THAT END WILL BE A SOUTH POLE IF THE CURRENT IS FLOWING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT CLOCKWISE AROUND THE BAR
THE SMALLER BATTERY BEING ALWAYS IN CIRCUIT WITH THE POLE CHANGER READY TO HAVE ITS POLARITY REVERSED ON THE MAIN LINE TO OPERATE THE DISTANT POLAR RELAY BUT THE SPRING RETRACTING THE ARMATURE OF THE NEUTRAL RELAY
COMPENSATING RESISTANCES AND CONDENSERS
IN THAT IT DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE OPERATION OF THE KEY AT THE HOME OFFICE BUT ONLY OPERATES IN RESPONSE TO THE MOVEMENTS OF THE DISTANT KEY
IF A ROD OF SOFT IRON BE WOUND AROUND WITH A NUMBER OF TURNS OF INSULATED WIRE AND A CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY BE SENT THROUGH THE WIRE THE ROD WILL BE INSTANTLY MAGNETIZED AND WILL REMAIN A MAGNET AS LONG AS THE CURRENT FLOWS
AND REFER THE READER TO THE ABOVE OR OTHER TEXT BOOKS IF HE DESIRES TO MAKE A CLOSE STUDY OF ITS INTRICATE OPERATIONS BEFORE FINALLY DISMISSING THE QUADRUPLEX AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE INQUIRING READER
AND ITS EXPLANATION FROM WHICH IT APPEARS THAT THE POLARITY OF A SOFT IRON BAR IS DETERMINED NOT BY THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT FLOWING AROUND IT BUT BY THE DIRECTION THEREOF WITH THIS IDEA CLEARLY IN MIND
THE CURRENT HOWEVER FLOWS OUT THROUGH THE MAIN LINE COIL OVER THE LINE AND THROUGH THE MAIN LINE COIL ONE AT B COMPLETING ITS CIRCUIT TO EARTH AND MAGNETIZING THE BAR OF THE RELAY THUS CAUSING ITS ARMATURE TO BE ATTRACTED
CURRENT FLOWS VIA POST P THROUGH S AND TO BOTH RELAY COILS AT A THENCE OVER THE MAIN LINE TO MAIN LINE COIL AT B
THE DUPLEXES ABOVE DESCRIBED COULD NOT BE USED ON A RAILROAD TELEGRAPH SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE NECESSITY OF ELECTRICALLY BALANCING THE LINE WHICH WHILE ENTIRELY FEASIBLE ON A THROUGH LINE
THIS INSTRUMENT CONSISTS ESSENTIALLY OF AN ELECTRO MAGNET OF HORSESHOE FORM WITH ITS TWO POLES CLOSE TOGETHER AND WITH ITS ARMATURE A BAR OF IRON
THUS THERE WAS INTRODUCED A NEW FEATURE INTO THE ART OF MULTIPLEX TELEGRAPHY FOR WHEREAS DUPLEXING ACCOMPLISHED BY VARYING THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT PERMITTED MESSAGES TO BE SENT SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM OPPOSITE STATIONS
THE ARROWS INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF FLOW ALL MAGNETS HAVE TWO POLES NORTH AND SOUTH A PERMANENT MAGNET MADE OF STEEL WHICH AS DISTINGUISHED FROM SOFT IRON RETAINS ITS MAGNETISM FOR LONG PERIODS
NOT ONLY DUPLEX OR IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AS ABOVE EXPLAINED BUT COULD ALSO BE SENT DIPLEX THAT IS TO SAY IN ONE DIRECTION SIMULTANEOUSLY AS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT MESSAGES OVER THE ONE LINE
AND DOWN TO EARTH THROUGH S AND THE ARMATURE LEVER WITH ITS GROUNDED WIRE THE RELAY AT A WOULD BE UNRESPONSIVE BUT THE CORE OF THE RELAY AT B WOULD BE MAGNETIZED AND ITS ARMATURE RESPOND TO SIGNALS FROM A
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC POLARITY ALSO REVERSES AND THE END OF THE PERMANENT MAGNET SWINGS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE
ALTHOUGH IN THE PATENT REFERRED TO EDISON SHOWED AND CLAIMED THE ADAPTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE TO DUPLEX TELEGRAPHY INDEED AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WAS FOUND THAT BY WINDING THE POLAR RELAY DIFFERENTIALLY
TO ITSELF PIECES OF IRON OR STEEL THE BASIC IMPORTANCE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET IN TELEGRAPHY WILL BE AT ONCE APPARENT WHEN WE CONSIDER THE SOUNDER WHOSE CLICKS ARE FAMILIAR TO EVERY EAR
WAS WHAT BROUGHT HIM VERY PROMINENTLY BEFORE THE NOTICE OF THE PUBLIC DUPLEX TELEGRAPHY OR THE SENDING OF TWO SEPARATE MESSAGES IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME OVER ONE LINE WAS KNOWN AND PRACTICED PREVIOUS TO THIS TIME
OR A NORTH POLE IF FLOWING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AS ILLUSTRATED AT THE RIGHT OF THE FIGURE
IN A RAILROAD SYSTEM THERE ARE USUALLY TWO TERMINAL STATIONS AND A NUMBER OF WAY STATIONS THERE IS NATURALLY MUCH INTERCOMMUNICATION WHICH WOULD BE GREATLY CURTAILED BY A SYSTEM HAVING THE CAPACITY OF ONLY A SINGLE MESSAGE AT A TIME
EQUAL CURRENTS WILL TRAVERSE THE WIRES
THE QUADRUPLEX WAS ALSO ARRANGED TO OPERATE ON THE WHEATSTONE BRIDGE PRINCIPLE
WITH A SIMPLE CIRCUIT THEREFORE BETWEEN TWO STATIONS AND WHERE AN INTERMEDIATE BATTERY IS NOT NECESSARY A RELAY IS NOT USED PASSING ON TO THE CONSIDERATION OF ANOTHER PHASE OF THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTROMAGNETISM
WHICH WOULD PRACTICALLY RESULT IN DOUBLING THE CURRENT IN EACH OF THE MAIN LINE COILS IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH BOTH RELAYS ARE ENERGIZED AND THEIR ARMATURES ATTRACTED THROUGH THE OPERATION OF THE KEYS AT THE DISTANT ENDS
THAT END BETWEEN THE TERMINALS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET BEING A NORTH POLE INASMUCH AS UNLIKE POLES OF MAGNETS ARE ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER AND LIKE POLES REPELLED
ON RELEASING THE KEY THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN AND MAGNETISM INSTANTLY CEASES IT WILL BE EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE OPERATOR AT A MAY CAUSE THE RELAY AT B
AN IDEA OF THEIR COMPLEXITY MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE FOLLOWING WHICH IS QUOTED FROM AMERICAN TELEGRAPHY AND ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE TELEGRAPH
SEEMINGLY VERY INTRICATE THE PRINCIPLES ARE REALLY QUITE SIMPLE AND THE DIFFICULTY OF COMPREHENSION IS MORE APPARENT THAN REAL IF THE UNDERLYING PHENOMENA ARE STUDIED ATTENTIVELY
THEY WILL TEND TO PRODUCE EXACTLY OPPOSITE POLARITIES AND THUS NEUTRALIZE EACH OTHER HENCE THE BAR WOULD REMAIN NON MAGNETIC AS THE PATH TO THE QUADRUPLEX PASSES THROUGH THE DUPLEX
MANIFESTLY THERE MUST BE PROVIDED SOME CONVENIENT WAY FOR RAPIDLY TRANSPOSING THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT FLOW IF SUCH A DEVICE AS THE POLAR RELAY IS TO BE USED FOR THE RECEPTION OF TELEGRAPH MESSAGES
INTRODUCED FOR THE SAKE OF CLEARNESS OF COMPREHENSION WHILE THE APPARATUS AND THE CIRCUITS
EDISON'S WORK IN STOCK PRINTERS AND TELEGRAPHY HAD MARKED HIM AS A RISING MAN IN THE ELECTRICAL ART OF THE PERIOD BUT HIS INVENTION OF QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
SENT OUT FROM ITS HOME OFFICE IT MUST RESPOND TO SIGNALS TRANSMITTED BY A DISTANT OFFICE HENCE THE NEXT FIGURE FOUR WITH ITS ACCOMPANYING EXPLANATION WILL PROBABLY MAKE THE MATTER CLEAR
IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD OF COURSE THAT THE POLAR RELAY AS USED IN THE QUADRUPLEX SYSTEM IS WOUND DIFFERENTIALLY AND THEREFORE ITS OPERATION IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN PRINCIPLE TO THAT OF THE DIFFERENTIALLY WOUND NEUTRAL RELAY
THIS DEVICE BEING A RELAY ITS PURPOSE IS TO REPEAT TRANSMITTED SIGNALS INTO A LOCAL CIRCUIT AS BEFORE EXPLAINED FOR THIS PURPOSE THERE ARE PROVIDED AT D AND E
BUT IN ACTUAL PRACTICE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN MORE THAN DOUBLE SERVICE IT HAS BEEN IN PRACTICAL USE FOR MANY YEARS ON SOME OF THE LEADING RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES
IT SHOULD BE STATED HOWEVER THAT BETWEEN THE OUTLINE AND THE FILLING IN OF THE DETAILS THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HARD WORK STUDY PATIENT PLODDING AND ENDLESS EXPERIMENTS BEFORE EDISON FINALLY PERFECTED HIS QUADRUPLEX SYSTEM
AND THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF AN INSTRUMENT CALLED A POLE CHANGER WHICH CONSISTS ESSENTIALLY OF A MOVABLE CONTACT PIECE CONNECTED PERMANENTLY TO THE EARTH OR GROUNDED AND ARRANGED TO CONNECT ONE
OR THE OTHER POLE OF A BATTERY TO THE LINE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY GROUND THE OTHER POLE THIS ACTION OF THE POLE CHANGER IS EFFECTED BY MOVEMENTS OF THE ARMATURE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET THROUGH THE MANIPULATION OF AN ORDINARY TELEGRAPH KEY
IN LIKE MANNER IF THE TRANSMITTER AT B BE CLOSED CURRENT WOULD FLOW THROUGH SIMILAR PARTS AND THUS CAUSE THE RELAY AT A TO RESPOND IF BOTH TRANSMITTERS BE CLOSED SIMULTANEOUSLY BOTH BATTERIES WILL BE PLACED TO THE LINE
MORE GENERALLY CALLED A NEUTRAL RELAY THE NON TECHNICAL READER MAY WONDER WHAT USE CAN POSSIBLY BE MADE OF AN APPARENTLY NON OPERATIVE PIECE OF APPARATUS IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOWEVER IN CONSIDERING A DUPLEX SYSTEM
WITHOUT PRODUCING A SOUND IN THE TELEPHONE
IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR IF IT WERE ATTEMPTED TO OFFER HERE A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE VARIED AND NUMEROUS OPERATIONS OF THE QUADRUPLEX THIS ARTICLE WOULD ASSUME THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREATISE
AND THE OBJECT OF ANXIOUS EFFORTS FOR MANY LONG YEARS IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE AND FOR SOME TIME AFTERWARD THE SYSTEM INVENTED BY JOSEPH STEARNS WAS THE DUPLEX IN PRACTICAL USE
AS APPLIED TO THE LINE AND THUS PRODUCING CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE POLARITY OF ANOTHER SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED TYPE OF RELAY CALLED A POLARIZED RELAY
BY AN OPERATOR AT THE HOME STATION AS IN THE OPERATION OF THE TRANSMITTER ABOVE REFERRED TO BY A COMBINATION OF THE NEUTRAL RELAY AND THE POLAR RELAY TWO OPERATORS BY MANIPULATING TWO TELEGRAPH KEYS
PARTLY BY THE MAIN LINE STATIC CURRENT PARTLY BY THE CONDENSER STATIC CURRENT AND YET ON A WELL ADJUSTED CIRCUIT THE DASH WILL HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ON THE QUADRUPLEX SOUNDER AS CLEARLY AS ANY DASH ON AN ORDINARY SINGLE WIRE SOUNDER
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECT EDISON INTRODUCED ANOTHER AND DISTINCT FEATURE NAMELY THE USING OF THE SAME CURRENT BUT ALSO VARYING ITS DIRECTION OF FLOW THAT IS TO SAY ALTERNATELY REVERSING THE POLARITY OF THE BATTERIES
IS OBVIOUSLY RESPONSIVE TO CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN POLARITY OF A POWERFUL CURRENT
BY ONE OF THESE TWO SYSTEMS A SINGLE WIRE COULD BE USED FOR SENDING TWO MESSAGES IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND BY THE OTHER IN THE SAME DIRECTION OR IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
ARE CONNECTED TO EARTH THERE IS A BATTERY C AND A KEY K WHEN THE KEY IS DEPRESSED CURRENT FLOWS THROUGH THE RELAY COILS AT A BUT NO MAGNETISM IS PRODUCED AS THEY OPPOSE EACH OTHER
EQUIPPED WITH ITS OWN BATTERY OR WHEN THE MESSAGE IS INTENDED FOR ITS OWN STATION SENDING THE MESSAGE TO AN ADJACENT SOUNDER INCLUDED IN A LOCAL BATTERY CIRCUIT
MAINTAINED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE POLES BUT KEPT NORMALLY IN A RETRACTED POSITION BY A SPRING WHEN THE DISTANT OPERATOR PRESSES DOWN HIS KEY THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED AND A CURRENT PASSES ALONG THE LINE
BEARING ALWAYS IN MIND THAT BY REASON OF THE DIFFERENTIAL WINDING OF THE POLAR AND NEUTRAL RELAYS NEITHER OF THE RELAYS AT ONE STATION WILL RESPOND TO THE HOME BATTERY AND CAN ONLY RESPOND TO THE DISTANT BATTERY
THE DISTANT POLE CHANGER MAY REVERSE ITS BATTERY SEVERAL TIMES THE HOME POLE CHANGER MAY DO LIKEWISE AND THE HOME TRANSMITTER MAY INCREASE AND DECREASE THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF THE HOME BATTERY REPEATEDLY
AND ARRANGING THE CIRCUITS AND COLLATERAL APPLIANCES APPROPRIATELY THE POLAR DUPLEX SYSTEM WAS MORE HIGHLY EFFICIENT THAN THE NEUTRAL SYSTEM AND IT IS EXTENSIVELY USED TO THE PRESENT DAY
REPEATING THE MESSAGES RECEIVED IN ITS COILS
A HINT AS TO AN ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NEUTRAL RELAY AS USED IN THE DUPLEX AND AS USED IN THE QUADRUPLEX MAY BE GIVEN
IS LED FROM A BATTERY AROUND A BAR OF SOFT IRON FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND ANOTHER WIRE OF EQUAL RESISTANCE AND EQUAL NUMBER OF TURNS B AROUND FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
IF THE MAKE AND BREAK OF THE MAGNETIZING CURRENT BE RAPID THE VIBRATIONS BEING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE HUMAN EAR THE DIAPHRAGM WILL PRODUCE AN AUDIBLE SOUND
THE RELAY COILS ARE CONNECTED BY WIRE TO THE SPRING PIECE S AND THE ARMATURE LEVER IS CONNECTED TO EARTH IF THE KEY IS DEPRESSED THE ARMATURE IS ATTRACTED AND ITS BENT END IS MOVED UPWARD
WHEN A SINGLE MESSAGE IS SENT FROM ONE STATION TO THE OTHER OR WHEN BOTH STATIONS ARE SENDING MESSAGES THAT DO NOT CONFLICT ONLY ONE BATTERY OR THE OTHER IS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN LINE BUT WITH THE QUADRUPLEX
AT THE MORE OR LESS DISTANT END OF A TELEGRAPH LINE THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF ELECTROMAGNETISM THESE PHENOMENA ARE EASY OF COMPREHENSION AND DEMONSTRATION
WE HAVE A DIFFERENTIAL DUPLEX ARRANGEMENT BY MEANS OF WHICH TWO OPERATORS MAY ACTUATE RELAYS AT THE ENDS DISTANT FROM THEM WITHOUT CAUSING THE OPERATION OF THE RELAYS AT THEIR HOME ENDS
THE CURRENT SO VARIED IN STRENGTH IS SUBJECT TO REVERSAL OF POLARITY BY THE POLE CHANGER BUT THE VARIATIONS IN STRENGTH HAVE NO EFFECT UPON THE DISTANT POLAR RELAY BECAUSE THAT RELAY BEING RESPONSIVE TO CHANGES IN POLARITY OF A WEAK CURRENT
AS TRANSMITTED BY THE OPERATOR SIMILAR MOVEMENTS PRODUCED IN LIKE MANNER ARE AVAILED OF IN ANOTHER INSTRUMENT KNOWN AS THE RELAY WHOSE OFFICE IS TO ACT PRACTICALLY AS AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMITTER KEY
AND THEREBY PRODUCED A SYSTEM BY MEANS OF WHICH FOUR MESSAGES COULD BE SENT OVER A SINGLE LINE AT THE SAME TIME TWO IN EACH DIRECTION
AND THROUGH THE GENERALLY TWO COILS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET THUS MAGNETIZING THE IRON CORE ITS ATTRACTIVE POWER DRAWS THE ARMATURE TOWARD THE POLES WHEN THE OPERATOR RELEASES THE PRESSURE ON HIS KEY THE CIRCUIT IS BROKEN
CURRENT DOES NOT FLOW THE MAGNETIC EFFECT CEASES AND THE ARMATURE IS DRAWN BACK BY ITS SPRING THESE MOVEMENTS GIVE RISE TO THE CLICKING SOUNDS WHICH REPRESENT THE DOTS AND DASHES OF THE MORSE OR OTHER ALPHABET
THE DISTANT STATION TO WHICH A MESSAGE IS TO BE SENT THE RELAY AT EACH END HAS TWO COILS ONE AND TWO
TWO IN EACH DIRECTION THUS EMPLOYING EIGHT OPERATORS FOUR AT EACH END TWO SENDING AND TWO RECEIVING
BUT WHY WILL THEY NOT ALSO OPERATE THE NEUTRAL RELAY AT THE DISTANT STATION AS WELL THIS DIFFICULTY WAS SOLVED BY DIVIDING THE BATTERY AT EACH STATION INTO TWO UNEQUAL PARTS
SIMILAR EFFECTS WOULD BE PRODUCED FROM B TO A IF THE BATTERY AND KEY WERE PLACED AT THE B END
HENCE TWO MESSAGES CAN BE SENT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS OVER THE SAME LINE SIMULTANEOUSLY THE READER WILL UNDOUBTEDLY SEE QUITE CLEARLY FROM THE ABOVE SYSTEM WHICH RESTS UPON VARYING THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT
AND ITS POLARITY REMAINS FIXED
AT A POINT A LITTLE BEYOND ITS CENTRE IS A SMALL PIECE OF INSULATING MATERIAL TO WHICH IS SCREWED A STRIP OF SPRING METAL S CONVENIENTLY PLACED WITH REFERENCE TO THE END OF THE LEVER IS A BENT METALLIC PIECE P
IT FOLLOWS THAT THIS NORTH POLE WILL BE REPELLED BY THE NORTH POLE OF THE ELECTROMAGNET BUT WILL SWING OVER AND BE ATTRACTED BY ITS SOUTH POLE IF THE DIRECTION OF FLOW OF CURRENT BE REVERSED BY REVERSING THE BATTERY
AND THE POLARITY OF THE SOFT IRON BAR IS DETERMINED BY THE DIRECTION OF FLOW OF CURRENT AROUND IT FOR THE TIME BEING IF THE DIRECTION IS REVERSED THE POLARITY WILL ALSO BE REVERSED
SO QUICKLY MADE BROKEN UP AND OTHERS REFORMED AS IN THE OPERATION OF THE EDISON QUADRUPLEX FOR EXAMPLE IT IS QUITE DEMONSTRABLE THAT DURING THE MAKING OF A SIMPLE DASH OF THE MORSE ALPHABET BY THE NEUTRAL RELAY AT THE HOME STATION
HENCE IF WE CONNECT ONE POLE OF A BATTERY WITH THE EARTH AND FROM THE OTHER POLE
THE ENDS OF WHICH ARE CONNECTED WITH A BATTERY B THUS FORMING AN ELECTROMAGNET AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS RELAY CONSISTS OF A SWINGING PERMANENT MAGNET C WHOSE POLARITY REMAINS FIXED
THE DETERMINING FACTOR OF POLARITY BEING THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT
SUPPOSE ONE OF THE OPERATORS IN NEW YORK FOR INSTANCE IS SENDING REVERSALS OF CURRENT TO CHICAGO WE CAN READILY SEE HOW THESE CHANGES IN POLARITY WILL OPERATE THE POLAR RELAY AT THE DISTANT STATION
WHEN THE KEY IS RELEASED THE BATTERY IS AGAIN CONNECTED TO EARTH THE COMPENSATING RESISTANCES AND CONDENSERS NECESSARY FOR A DUPLEX ARRANGEMENT ARE SHOWN IN THE DIAGRAM
THAT A DIFFERENTIAL RELAY IS USED AT EACH END OF THE LINE AND FORMS PART OF THE CIRCUIT AND THAT WHILE EACH RELAY MUST BE ABSOLUTELY UNRESPONSIVE TO THE SIGNALS
IS MADE SO STIFF AS TO RESIST THESE WEAK CURRENTS IF HOWEVER THE TRANSMITTER IS OPERATED AT THE SAME END THE ENTIRE BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN LINE AND THE STRENGTH OF THIS CURRENT IS SUFFICIENT TO OPERATE THE NEUTRAL RELAY
THE SYSTEM IS A COMBINATION OF TELEGRAPHIC APPARATUS AND TELEPHONE RECEIVER ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE THE LATTER INSTRUMENT IS NOT USED IN THE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD MANNER IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE DIAPHRAGM OF A TELEPHONE VIBRATES WITH THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE CURRENT ENERGIZING THE MAGNET BENEATH IT
THE EQUIPMENT OF SUCH A SYSTEM AT EACH END OF THE LINE CONSISTS OF THESE TWO INSTRUMENTS TOGETHER WITH THE SPECIAL FORM OF TRANSMITTER AND THE POLE CHANGER AND THEIR KEYS FOR ACTUATING THE NEUTRAL AND POLAR RELAYS AT THE OTHER OR DISTANT END
WITH THE DUPLEX AS WE HAVE SEEN THE CURRENT ON THE MAIN LINE IS CHANGED IN STRENGTH ONLY WHEN BOTH KEYS AT OPPOSITE STATIONS ARE CLOSED TOGETHER SO THAT A CURRENT DUE TO BOTH BATTERIES FLOWS OVER THE MAIN LINE
OUR EXPLANATION HAS MERELY AIMED TO SHOW THE UNDERLYING PHENOMENA AND PRINCIPLES IN BROAD OUTLINE WITHOUT ENTERING INTO MORE DETAIL THAN WAS DEEMED ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
PARTLY BY THE HOME BATTERY PARTLY BY THE DISTANT AND HOME BATTERIES COMBINED PARTLY BY CURRENT ON THE MAIN LINE
THUS FAR WE HAVE REFERRED TO TWO SYSTEMS ONE THE NEUTRAL OR DIFFERENTIAL DUPLEX
AT THE ROOT OF ALL SYSTEMS OF TELEGRAPHY INCLUDING MULTIPLEX SYSTEMS THERE LIES THE SINGLE BASIC PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THEIR PERFORMANCE DEPENDS NAMELY THE OBTAINING OF A SLIGHT MECHANICAL MOVEMENT
IN APRIL OF THAT YEAR HOWEVER EDISON TOOK UP THE STUDY OF THE SUBJECT AND FILED TWO APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS
BUT QUADRUPLEX TELEGRAPHY OR THE SIMULTANEOUS SENDING OF FOUR SEPARATE MESSAGES TWO IN EACH DIRECTION OVER A SINGLE LINE HAD NOT BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MANY AN INVENTOR'S DREAM
WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED YOUR LISTENING TO ANY SORT OF REASON HER HEART BEAT A LITTLE QUICKER BUT SHE STILLED IT YOU DEEM THAT IT WAS NOT IN REASON THAT I SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE THE WIFE OF SIR FRANCIS LEVISON HE ROSE AND BEGAN KICKING AT THE LOGS WITH THE HEEL OF HIS BOOT THIS TIME
I BEG OF YOU TO CEASE SHE PASSIONATELY INTERRUPTED WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR TAKE YOU FOR WHY HOW CAN YOU LIVE YOU HAVE NO FORTUNE YOU MUST RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM SOME ONE I WILL NOT RECEIVE IT FROM YOU IF THE WHOLE WORLD DENIED ME
YOU MAY DROP THAT ODIOUS TITLE ISABEL WHICH HAS STUCK TO ME TOO LONG I OWN A BETTER NOW WHAT ONE PRAY YOU CAN LOOK AND SEE LADY ISABEL TOOK UP THE LETTER AND READ IT SIR FRANCIS SWALLOWED DOWN HIS COFFEE AND RANG THE
YOU MIGHT NOT BE BACK IN TIME IN TIME FOR WHAT OH HOW CAN YOU ASK SHE REJOINED IN A SHARP TONE OF REPROACH YOU KNOW TOO WELL IN TIME TO MAKE ME YOUR WIFE WHEN THE DIVORCE SHALL APPEAR I SHALL CHANCE IT
THE ENDURANCE OF WOMAN TO BEAR RESOLVE TO BEAR THEM FALL DOWN UPON YOUR KNEES AND PRAY TO BE ENABLED TO BEAR THEM PRAY FOR PATIENCE PRAY FOR STRENGTH TO RESIST THE DEMON THAT WOULD TEMPT YOU TO ESCAPE BEAR UNTO DEATH
THAT MILADI WOULD SOON GET ABOUT IF SHE WOULD ONLY ROUSE HERSELF SHE HAD GOT SO FAR ABOUT AS TO SIT UP IN THE WINDY CHAMBER AND IT SEEMED TO BE TO HER A MATTER OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE WHETHER SHE EVER GOT OUT OF IT
IF YOU HAVE TAKEN THIS AVERSION TO ME IT CANNOT BE HELPED HE COLDLY SAID INWARDLY CONGRATULATING HIMSELF LET US NOT DOUBT AT BEING SPARED THE WORK OF TROUBLE HE HAD ANTICIPATED YOU MADE COMMOTION ENOUGH ONCE ABOUT ME MAKING YOU REPARATION
YOUR WORDS ARE NOT WORDS OF TRUTH BUT OF DECEIT YOU DID NOT INTEND TO BE BACK IN TIME FOR THE MARRIAGE
HOW CAN YOU BE SO ALARMED ISABEL OF COURSE I HAVE HE CONTINUED IN A PEEVISH THOUGH KIND TONE AS HE TOOK HOLD OF HER HANDS TO RAISE HER NO NOT YET I WILL REMAIN HERE UNTIL YOU SAY YOU WILL WAIT ANOTHER DAY OR TWO
LAST OUT A WHOLE TEN MONTHS YOU ARE IN EGREGIOUS ERROR COMPLIMENTS THE VERY OPPOSITE TO HONEY AND SWEETNESS HAVE GENERALLY SUPERVENED LONG BEFORE TRY IT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME TWO LETTERS SHE CONTINUED
OUTWARDLY INTO CALMNESS AGAIN WHAT ELSE RETORTED SIR FRANCIS YOU KNOW MY DISPOSITION PRETTY WELL BY THIS TIME ISABEL AND MAY BE SURE THAT IF YOU DEAL OUT SMALL CHANGE TO ME
MISERY MARKS THE COUNTENANCE WORSE THAN SICKNESS HER FACE WAS WHITE AND WORN HER HANDS WERE THIN HER EYES WERE SUNKEN AND SURROUNDED BY A BLACK CIRCLE CARE WAS DIGGING CAVES FOR THEM
LADY ISABEL EXCITED BEYOND ALL SELF CONTROL SLIPPED THE BOLT OF THE DOOR AND HALF LEANING AGAINST IT HALF LEANING AT HIS FEET HELD UP HER HAND IN SUPPLICATION FRANCIS HAVE YOU ANY CONSIDERATION LEFT FOR ME ANY IN THE WORLD
WHAT FANCIES YOU DO TAKE UP UTTERED FRANCIS LEVISON SOME TIME SUBSEQUENT TO YOUR DEPARTURE SHE QUIETLY WENT ON ONE OF THE MAIDS WAS SETTING TO RIGHTS THE CLOTHES IN YOUR DRESSING CLOSET AND SHE BROUGHT ME A LETTER SHE FOUND IN ONE OF THE POCKETS
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD ALL THE REPARATION IN YOUR POWER TO MAKE ALL THE REPARATION THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CAN INVENT COULD NOT UNDO MY SIN IT AND THE EFFECTS MUST LIE UPON ME FOREVER OH SIN WAS THE DERISIVE EXCLAMATION
NEWS OF THE DIVORCE I MEAN TUSH WAS THE RESPONSE OF CAPTAIN LEVISON AS IF WISHING TO IMPLY THAT THE DIVORCE WAS YET A FAR OFF AFFAIR
IN A SUBDUED QUIET TONE NOT TO DRAW TOO NEAR AS ANY LITTLE EXCITEMENT MADE HER FAINT NOW HE TOOK A SEAT OPPOSITE TO HER AND BEGAN PUSHING THE LOGS TOGETHER WITH HIS BOOT AS HE EXPLAINED THAT HE REALLY COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM TOWN BEFORE
HE SHOULD HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN THROWING OFF THE MASK BUT HE WAS AN ILL TEMPERED MAN AND TO HEAR THAT THE LETTER HAD BEEN FOUND TO HAVE THE FALSENESS OF HIS FINE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISES LAID BARE DID NOT IMPROVE HIS TEMPER NOW LADY ISABEL CONTINUED
WAS HER ICY ANSWER LET'S SEE HOW OLD IS HE NOW HE WAS BORN ON THE LAST DAY OF AUGUST SIR FRANCIS THREW UP HIS ARMS AND STRETCHED HIMSELF AS IF A FIT OF IDLENESS HAD OVERTAKEN HIM THEN ADVANCED TO THE CRADLE AND PULLED DOWN THE CLOTHES
OVER HIS SHOULDER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CRADLE WHAT HAVE YOU NAMED THAT YOUNG ARTICLE THERE THE NAME WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HIS BY INHERITANCE
AND SHE SHOOK AND SHIVERED PERPETUALLY THOUGH SHE HAD DRAWN SO CLOSE TO THE WOOD FIRE THAT THERE WAS A DANGER OF HER PETTICOATS IGNITING AND THE ATTENDANT HAD FREQUENTLY TO SPRING UP AND INTERPOSE BETWEEN THEM AND THE CRACKLING LOGS
SHE WISHED TO GO FARTHER ON WHERE THEY MIGHT GET QUICKER NEWS FROM ENGLAND BUT HER WILL NOW WAS AS NOTHING SHE WAS LOOKING LIKE THE GHOST OF HER FORMER SELF TALK OF HER HAVING LOOKED ILL WHEN SHE TOOK THAT VOYAGE OVER THE WATER WITH MISTER CARLYLE YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER NOW
LANGUIDLY SHE TOOK HER SEAT AT THE TABLE JUST AS CAPTAIN LEVISON'S SERVANT A FRENCHMAN WHOM HE HAD ENGAGED IN PARIS ENTERED THE ROOM WITH TWO LETTERS POINT DE GAZETTE PIERRE
DON'T I KNOW IT HAVE I NOT SAID SO SHE SHARPLY INTERRUPTED AND THEN SHE SAT STRIVING TO CALM HERSELF CLASPING TOGETHER HER SHAKING HANDS WELL IF YOU WILL PERSIST IN THIS PERVERSE RESOLUTION I CANNOT MEND IT
COOLLY OBSERVED SIR FRANCIS CHANCE IT CHANCE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE CHILD YOU MUST ASSURE THAT BEFORE ALL THINGS
AND CALLING THE SERVANTS BEFORE HIM THERE WERE BUT TWO GAVE THEM EACH A YEAR'S WAGES IN ADVANCE
AND THEY ARE BOTH IN THE SAME HANDWRITING YOUR SOLICITORS I BELIEVE UP WENT HIS HAND AT THE LAST WORD AND HE MADE A SORT OF GRAB AT THE LETTERS STALKED TO THE FARTHEST WINDOW OPENED IT AND GLANCED OVER ITS CONTENTS SIR
LITTLE THOUGHT SHE THAT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST INTENTION ON HIS PART TO MAKE HER REPARATION ANY MORE THAN HE HAD MADE IT TO OTHERS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE HER SHE HAD BECOME PAINFULLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THE MAN FOR WHOM SHE HAD CHOSEN TO SACRIFICE HERSELF
THESE APARTMENTS ARE MINE NOW THEY HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED INTO MY NAME AND THEY CAN NEVER AGAIN AFFORD YOU ACCOMMODATION WILL YOU BE SO OBLIGING I AM NOT STRONG AS TO HAND ME THAT WRITING CASE SIR FRANCIS WALKED TO THE TABLE SHE INDICATED
AND SAW AN INFANT'S CRADLE BY THE SIDE OF THE BED HE DID NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO LOOK AT IT I AM THE REPRESENTATIVE NOW OF AN ANCIENT AND RESPECTED BARONETCY HE RESUMED IN A TONE AS OF APOLOGY FOR HIS PREVIOUS HEARTLESS WORDS
WE HAVE MUCH PLEASURE IN CONGRATULATING YOU UPON YOUR ACCESSION TO THE TITLE AND ESTATES AND BEG TO STATE THAT SHOULD IT NOT BE CONVENIENT TO YOU TO VISIT ENGLAND AT PRESENT WE WILL BE HAPPY TO TRANSACT ALL NECESSARY MATTERS FOR YOU
NEARLY AN HOUR ELAPSED WHEN SHE REMEMBERED THE BREAKFAST THINGS AND RANG FOR THEM TO BE REMOVED
WELL ISABEL YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT IT IS AN AWFUL SACRIFICE FOR A MAN IN MY POSITION TO MARRY A DIVORCED WOMAN THE HECTIC FLUSHED INTO HER THIN CHEEKS BUT HER VOICE SOUNDED CALM AS BEFORE
WHEN I EXPECTED OR WISHED FOR THE SACRIFICE IT WAS NOT FOR MY OWN SAKE I TOLD YOU SO THEN BUT IT WAS NOT MADE AND THE CHILD'S INHERITANCE IS THAT OF SIN AND SHAME THERE HE LIES SIR FRANCIS HALF TURNED TO WHERE SHE POINTED
QUITE TRUE WAS HER REPLY AND I BELIEVE YOU WERE ON THE WRONG SCENT ISABEL IF IT WILL BE ANY SATISFACTION TO YOU TO HEAR IT SINCE WE ARE MUTUALLY ON THIS COMPLIMENTARY DISCOURSE IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO SMOOTH OVER FACTS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE UNDECEIVED ME THEN TO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE HOPES I WAS CHERISHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE UNBORN CHILD WERE WORSE THAN VAIN I DID NOT JUDGE SO HE REPLIED THE EXCITED STATE YOU THEN APPEARED TO BE IN
ALLOW ME TO RETURN THEM TO YOU COUNT THEM RETURN THEM TO ME FOR WHAT INQUIRED SIR FRANCIS IN AMAZEMENT I HAVE NO LONGER ANYTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH YOU IN ANY WAY DO NOT MAKE MY ARM ACHE HOLDING OUT THESE NOTES TO YOU SO LONG TAKE THEM
YOU WILL SPEEDILY GATHER HIS MOTIVE PIERRE DEPARTED TOWARD CAPTAIN LEVISON'S ROOM AND LADY ISABEL TOOK UP THE LETTERS AND EXAMINED THEIR SUPERSCRIPTION WITH INTEREST IT WAS KNOWN TO HER THAT MISTER CARLYLE HAD NOT LOST A MOMENT
SCARCELY HAD SHE CLOSED THE DOOR UPON HERSELF AND THE TRAY WHEN SIR FRANCIS LEVISON APPEARED EQUIPPED FOR TRAVELING GOOD BYE ISABEL SAID HE WITHOUT FURTHER CIRCUMLOCUTION OR CEREMONY
YOU WILL WAIT I CANNOT WAIT HE REPLIED HIS TONE CHANGING TO ONE OF DETERMINATION IT IS USELESS TO URGE IT HE BROKE FROM HER AND LEFT THE ROOM AND IN ANOTHER MINUTE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE PIERRE ATTENDING HIM A FEELING AMOUNTING TO A CONVICTION
IT WAS SHARPLY WOUNDING HER WITH ITS ADDER STINGS AND SHE KNEW THAT HER WHOLE FUTURE EXISTENCE WHETHER SPENT WITH THAT MAN OR WITHOUT HIM WOULD BE A DARK COURSE OF GNAWING RETRIBUTION NEARLY A YEAR WENT BY SAVE SOME SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS
WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT THE SUIT CARLYLE VS CARLYLE IS AT AN END THE DIVORCE WAS PRONOUNCED WITHOUT OPPOSITION ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUEST WE HASTEN TO FORWARD YOU THE EARLIEST INTIMATION OF THE FACT WE ARE SIR FAITHFULLY YOURS MOSS AND GRAB
THE DECKED OUT DANDIES BEFORE THE WORLD ARE FREQUENTLY THE GREATEST SLOVENS IN DOMESTIC PRIVACY HE WISHED HER GOOD MORNING IN A CARELESS TONE OF APATHY AND SHE AS APATHETICALLY ANSWERED TO IT PIERRE SAYS THERE ARE SOME LETTERS HE BEGAN
A STRANGER MIGHT HAVE ATTRIBUTED THESE SIGNS TO THE STATE OF HER HEALTH SHE KNEW BETTER KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE EFFECTS OF HER WRETCHED MIND AND HEART IT WAS VERY LATE FOR BREAKFAST BUT WHY SHOULD SHE RISE EARLY ONLY TO DRAG THROUGH ANOTHER ENDLESS DAY
SIR AFTER SENDING OFF OUR LAST DATED TO DAY WE RECEIVED TIDINGS OF THE DEMISE OF SIR PETER LEVISON YOUR GRAND UNCLE HE EXPIRED THIS AFTERNOON IN TOWN WHERE HE HAD COME FOR THE BENEFIT OF MEDICAL ADVICE
NEARLY A YEAR WENT BY LADY ISABEL CARLYLE HAD SPENT IT ON THE CONTINENT THAT REFUGE FOR SUCH FUGITIVES NOW MOVING ABOUT FROM PLACE TO PLACE WITH HER COMPANION NOW STATIONARY AND ALONE QUITE HALF THE TIME
SARCASTICALLY REJOINED SIR FRANCIS GENEROUS MAN A FLUSH DEEP AND PAINFUL DYED HER CHEEKS I SHOULD HAVE SAID MY LATE HUSBAND YOU NEED NOT HAVE REMINDED ME OF THE MISTAKE
TABLE HAND BELL THE ONLY BELL YOU GENERALLY MEET WITH IN FRANCE PIERRE ANSWERED IT PUT ME UP A CHANGE OF THINGS SAID HE IN FRENCH I START FOR ENGLAND IN AN HOUR IT IS VERY WELL PIERRE RESPONDED AND DEPARTED TO DO IT
SHE MADE NO REPLY SIR FRANCIS PUT THE CLOTHES BACK OVER THE SLEEPING CHILD RETURNED TO THE FIRE AND STOOD A FEW MOMENTS WITH HIS BACK TO IT IS MY ROOM PREPARED FOR ME DO YOU KNOW HE PRESENTLY ASKED NO IT IS NOT SHE QUIETLY REJOINED
RESUMED SIR FRANCIS IN A LITTLE TIME YOU MAY PROBABLY WISH TO RECALL IT IN WHICH CASE A LINE ADDRESSED TO ME AT MY BANKER'S WILL LADY ISABEL DREW HERSELF UP PUT AWAY THOSE NOTES IF YOU PLEASE SHE INTERRUPTED NOT ALLOWING HIM TO FINISH HIS SENTENCE
WHERE IS PIERRE MILADI ASKED
BUT THE INSTANT THE STEP WAS IRREVOCABLE THE INSTANT SHE HAD LEFT THE BARRIER BEHIND REPENTANCE SET IN EVEN IN THE FIRST DAYS OF HER DEPARTURE IN THE FLEETING MOMENTS OF ABANDONMENT WHEN IT MAY BE SUPPOSED SHE MIGHT MOMENTARILY FORGET CONSCIENCE
I RECEIVED THESE FROM YOU A MONTH AGO SHE SAID THEY CAME BY POST AND NEVER HAD THE GRACE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM HE RETURNED IN A SORT OF MOCK REPROACHFUL TONE FORTY POUNDS THAT WAS THE AMOUNT WAS IT NOT I BELIEVE SO
SHE HAD HAD A LONG ILLNESS TERMINATING IN A LOW FEVER
WHEN INSTEAD OF THE GARDEN OF ROSES IT HAD BEEN HER PERSUADER'S PLEASURE TO PROMISE HER SHE WOULD FALL INTO BUT WHICH IN TRUTH SHE HAD BARELY GLANCED AT FOR THAT HAD NOT BEEN HER MOVING MOTIVE
EXCEPTING THAT IT WAS CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICE AND OLD MISTER DILL AND THAT MISTER CARLYLE LAUGHED WHEN HE TOLD IT THEY APPEARED TO BE INTERRUPTED BY THE CRYING OF ARCHIBALD AND IN TURNING TO THE LAWN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE AWOKE
HER DANCING ATTENDANCE UPON HIM PERPETUALLY RELATED TO THAT AND THAT ALONE HER FACE WAS MORE FLUSHED THAN IT HAD BEEN THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW HE SPOKE QUIETLY NOW QUITE IN AN EQUAL TONE OF REASONING IT WAS HIS WAY WHEN THE ILL TEMPER WAS UPON HIM
I WISH YOU A GOOD DAY SO YOU WILL NOT EVEN SHAKE HANDS WITH ME ISABEL I WOULD PREFER NOT AND THUS THEY PARTED SIR FRANCIS LEFT THE ROOM BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY THE HOUSE HE WENT INTO A DISTANT APARTMENT
THERE HAS BEEN NO DELAY QUITE THE CONTRARY BUT IT MAY BE EXPECTED HOURLY NOW YOU ARE WORRYING YOURSELF FOR NOTHING ISABEL I SHALL BE BACK IN TIME HE QUITTED THE ROOM AS HE SPOKE AND LADY ISABEL REMAINED IN IT THE IMAGE OF DESPAIR
IF YOU WILL ACCEPT NOTHING FOR YOURSELF YOU MUST FOR THE CHILD HE AT ANY RATE FALLS TO MY SHARE I SHALL GIVE YOU A FEW HUNDRED A YEAR WITH HIM SHE BEAT HER HANDS BEFORE HER AS IF BEATING OFF THE MAN AND HIS WORDS
REMEMBER THOUGH THAT IT IS YOUR DOING NOT MINE BUT YOU CANNOT THINK I AM GOING TO SEE YOU STARVE ISABEL A SUM WE WILL FIX UPON THE AMOUNT AMICABLY
IT WAS OVER THEN AND ALL CLAIM TO THE NAME OF CARLYLE WAS DECLARED TO HAVE BEEN FORFEITED BY THE LADY ISABEL FOREVER CAPTAIN LEVISON FOLDED UP THE LETTER AND PLACED IT SECURELY IN AN INNER POCKET IS THERE ANY NEWS SHE ASKED
NOW DON'T PUT YOURSELF IN A FEVER ISABEL HOW MANY TIMES AM I TO BE COMPELLED TO BEG THAT OF YOU IT DOES NO GOOD IS IT MY FAULT IF I AM CALLED SUDDENLY TO ENGLAND HAVE YOU NO PITY FOR YOUR CHILD SHE URGED IN AGITATION
ON YOUR FAVORING US WITH INSTRUCTIONS AND WE REMAIN SIR MOST FAITHFULLY YOURS MOSS AND GRAB SIR FRANCIS LEVISON BART THE OUTSIDE OF THE LETTER WAS SUPERSCRIBED AS THE OTHER F LEVISON ESQUIRE
YOU LADIES SHOULD THINK OF THAT BEFOREHAND YES SHE SADLY ANSWERED MAY HEAVEN HELP ALL TO DO SO WHO MAY BE TEMPTED AS I WAS IF YOU MEAN THAT AS A REPROACH TO ME IT'S RATHER OUT OF PLACE CHAFED SIR FRANCIS
YOU KNOW THAT THE FRENCH PROTESTANT MINISTER IS PREPARED TO MARRY US THE INSTANT NEWS OF THE DIVORCE SHALL ARRIVE
AND WHITE AND SLEETY AND SLOPPY THE GUTTERS RUNNING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF CERTAIN OF THE STREETS WERE UNUSUALLY BLACK AND THE PEOPLE CREPT ALONG ESPECIALLY DISMAL CLOSE TO THE FIRE IN THE BARN OF A FRENCH BEDROOM
I SAW BY THE DATE THAT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE TWO WHICH YOU RECEIVED ON THE MORNING OF YOUR DEPARTURE IT CONTAINED THE INFORMATION THAT THE DIVORCE WAS PRONOUNCED SHE SPOKE SO QUIETLY SO APPARENTLY WITHOUT FEELING OR PASSION THAT SIR FRANCIS WAS AGREEABLY ASTONISHED
AT LAST THANK THE PIGS WAS THE GENTLEMAN'S EUPHONIOUS EXPRESSION AS HE TOSSED THE LETTER OPEN ON THE BREAKFAST TABLE THE DIVORCE IS GRANTED FEVERISHLY UTTERED LADY ISABEL HE MADE NO REPLY BUT SEATED HIMSELF TO BREAKFAST
AND I SAY I THINK YOU ARE ON THE WRONG SCENT I DO NOT BELIEVE MISTER CARLYLE EVER THOUGHT OF THE GIRL IN THAT WAY WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE GASPED THEY HAD A SECRET BETWEEN THEM NOT OF LOVE A SECRET OF BUSINESS AND THOSE INTERVIEWS THEY HAD TOGETHER
BESIDES I SHOULD NOT CHOOSE FOR THE OLD MAN'S FUNERAL TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT ME
ALAS IT WAS THE ACTUAL CRYING OF HER OWN CHILD WHICH AWOKE HER THIS LAST CHILD THE ILL FATED LITTLE BEING IN THE CRADLE BESIDE HER
IN SEEKING A DIVORCE AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT WAS GRANTED WAS NOW DAILY EXPECTED SHE WAS ANXIOUS FOR IT ANXIOUS THAT CAPTAIN LEVISON SHOULD RENDER HER THE ONLY REPARATION IN HIS POWER BEFORE THE BIRTH OF HER UNHAPPY CHILD
SHE HAD FOUND HERSELF PLUNGED INTO A YAWNING ABYSS OF HORROR FROM WHICH THERE WAS NEVER MORE ANY ESCAPE NEVER MORE NEVER MORE THE VERY INSTANT THE VERY NIGHT OF HER DEPARTURE SHE AWOKE TO WHAT SHE HAD DONE THE GUILT
TAKING ONE ABSENCE WITH THE OTHER HE HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HER CHIEFLY IN PARIS PURSUING HIS OWN COURSE AND HIS OWN PLEASURE HOW FARED IT WITH LADY ISABEL JUST AS IT MUST BE EXPECTED TO FARE AND DOES FARE
THE GIRL DEPARTED CLOSING THE DOOR AND LADY ISABEL SAT LOOKING AT IT SCHOOLING HER PATIENCE ANOTHER MOMENT AND IT WAS FLUNG OPEN SIR FRANCIS LEVISON APPROACHED TO GREET HER AS HE CAME IN SHE WAVED HIM OFF BEGGING HIM
RATHER THAN FORFEIT YOUR FAIR NAME AND YOUR GOOD CONSCIENCE FOR BE ASSURED THAT THE ALTERNATIVE IF YOU DO RUSH ON TO IT WILL BE FOUND WORSE THAN DEATH POOR THING POOR LADY ISABEL SHE HAD SACRIFICED HUSBAND CHILDREN
THAN I FOUND MYSELF OVERWHELMED WITH BUSINESS AND AWAY FROM IT I COULD NOT GET EVEN NOW I CAN ONLY REMAIN WITH YOU A COUPLE OF DAYS FOR I MUST HASTEN BACK TO TOWN YOU ARE BREAKING FAITH ALREADY SHE SAID AFTER HEARING HIM CALMLY TO THE END
SHE PURSUED BENDING HER EYES DETERMINATELY UPON HIM IT MUST BE WITH ALL MY HEART RETURNED SIR FRANCIS IT IS YOU WHO HAVE THROWN OUT THE CHALLENGE MIND
YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ORDER PIERRE TO TAKE AWAY THIS AFTERNOON AND NOW SIR FRANCIS I BELIEVE THAT IS ALL WE WILL PART TO REMAIN MORTAL ENEMIES FROM HENCEFORTH IS THAT TO BE IT TO BE STRANGERS SHE REPLIED CORRECTING HIM
SIR FRANCIS THANKING HIS LUCKY STAR THAT HE HAD SO EASILY GOT RID OF A VEXATIOUS ANNOYANCE AND LADY ISABEL SHE PASSED HER EVENING ALONE SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND THE SPARKS
THEN HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LANDLORD AND HANDED HIM LIKEWISE A YEAR'S RENT IN ADVANCE MAKING THE SAME REMARK AFTER THAT HE ORDERED DINNER AT A HOTEL AND THE SAME NIGHT HE AND PIERRE DEPARTED ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME AGAIN
FULL OF WINDOWS AND DOORS AND DRAUGHTS WITH ITS WIDE HEARTH AND ITS WIDE CHIMNEY INTO WHICH WE COULD PUT FOUR OR FIVE OF OUR ENGLISH ONES SHIVERED LADY ISABEL VANE SHE HAD AN INVALID CAP ON AND A THICK WOOLEN INVALID SHAWL
WHICH WAS AT THE FAR END OF THE GREAT BARN OF A ROOM AND TAKING THE WRITING CASE FROM IT GAVE IT TO HER SHE REACHED HER KEYS FROM THE STAND AT HER ELBOW UNLOCKED THE CASE AND TOOK FROM IT SOME BANK NOTES
WHOSE ASPECT HAD BEEN SHUNNED IN THE PROSPECTIVE ASSUMED AT ONCE ITS TRUE FRIGHTFUL COLOR THE BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS AND A LIVELY REMORSE A NEVER DYING ANGUISH TOOK POSSESSION OF HER SOUL FOREVER OH READER BELIEVE ME
WHEN A HIGH PRINCIPLED GENTLEWOMAN FALLS FROM HER PEDESTAL NEVER HAD SHE EXPERIENCED A MOMENT'S CALM OR PEACE OR HAPPINESS SINCE THE FATAL NIGHT OF QUITTING HER HOME SHE HAD TAKEN A BLIND LEAP IN A MOMENT OF WILD PASSION
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WOULD IMPLY SHE SAID DRAWING HER SHAWL ROUND HER WITH A FRESH SHIVER HOW ON THE WRONG SCENT WITH REGARD TO YOUR HUSBAND AND THAT HARE GIRL YOU WERE BLINDLY OUTRAGEOUSLY JEALOUS OF HIM GO ON
WHAT REASON I MUST REQUEST YOU TO TELL ME I OVERHEARD SCRAPS OF THEIR CONVERSATION NOW AND THEN IN THOSE MEETINGS AND SO GATHERED MY INFORMATION YOU TOLD A DIFFERENT TALE TO ME SIR FRANCIS WAS HER REMARK
WHO IS HE LIKE ISABEL MY HANDSOME SELF WERE HE LIKE YOU IN SPIRIT I WOULD PRAY THAT HE MIGHT DIE ERE HE COULD SPEAK OR THINK SHE BURST FORTH AND THEN REMEMBERING THE RESOLUTION MARKED OUT FOR HERSELF SUBSIDED
INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHEN LADY ISABEL LAY DOWN TO REST SHE SANK INTO A SOMEWHAT CALMER SLEEP THAN SHE HAD KNOWN OF LATE ALSO INTO A DREAM SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BACK AT EAST LYNNE NOT BACK IN ONE SENSE
AND THE CALMER HE SPOKE THE MORE CUTTING WERE HIS WORDS HE NEED NOT HAVE TOLD HER THIS WHAT WAS THE SECRET SHE INQUIRED IN A LOW TONE NAY I CAN'T EXPLAIN ALL THEY DID NOT TAKE ME INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE THEY DID NOT EVEN TAKE YOU
WHEN YOU LEFT IN JULY YOU GAVE ME A SACRED PROMISE TO COME BACK IN TIME FOR OUR MARRIAGE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY IN TIME BUT OF COURSE I MEANT TO DO SO WHEN I GAVE THE PROMISE HE INTERRUPTED BUT NO SOONER HAD I SET MY FOOT IN LONDON
LADY WIFE MOTHER SHOULD YOU EVER BE TEMPTED TO ABANDON YOUR HOME SO WILL YOU AWAKE WHATEVER TRIALS MAY BE THE LOT OF YOUR MARRIED LIFE THOUGH THEY MAY MAGNIFY THEMSELVES TO YOUR CRUSHED SPIRIT AS BEYOND THE NATURE
IF IT BE YOUR WISH THAT ALL RELATIONS SHOULD END BETWEEN US WHY LET IT BE SO HE SAID I MUST CONFESS I THINK IT MAY BE THE WISEST COURSE AS THINGS HAVE COME TO THIS PASS FOR A CAT AND DOG LIFE WHICH WOULD SEEMINGLY BE OURS IS NOT AGREEABLE
HE TOOK OUT HIS POCKET BOOK AND PLACED THE BANK NOTES WITHIN IT YOUR CLOTHES
AND CARLYLE WAS ACTING IN IT UNDER THE ROSE FOR MISSUS HARE SHE COULD NOT SEEK OUT CARLYLE HERSELF SO SHE SENT THE YOUNG LADY THAT'S ALL I KNOW HOW DID YOU KNOW IT I HAD REASON TO THINK SO
WHOM DO YOU TAKE ME FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR SHE REPEATED RISING IN HER BITTER MORTIFICATION IF YOU HAVE PUT ME BEYOND THE PALE OF THE WORLD I AM STILL LORD MOUNT SEVERN'S DAUGHTER YOU DID AS MUCH TOWARD PUTTING YOURSELF BEYOND ITS PALE AS
REPUTATION HOME ALL THAT MAKES LIFE OF VALUE TO WOMAN SHE HAD FORFEITED HER DUTY TO GOD HAD DELIBERATELY BROKEN HIS COMMANDMENTS FOR THE ONE POOR MISERABLE MISTAKE OF FLYING WITH FRANCIS LEVISON
AS SHE TURNED HER INDIGNANT EYES TOWARD HIM SIR FRANCIS LAUGHED ALL STRATAGEMS ARE FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR SHE DARED NOT IMMEDIATELY TRUST HERSELF TO REPLY AND A SILENCE ENSUED SIR FRANCIS BROKE IT POINTING WITH HIS LEFT THUMB
HAD HE COME WHO IS IT SHE ASKED OF THE NURSE MILADI IT IS MONSIEUR AND PIERRE IS WITH HIM I HAVE BEGGED MILADY OFTEN AND OFTEN NOT TO FRET FOR MONSIEUR WOULD SURELY COME MILADI SEE I AM RIGHT
AND BRING A CLERGYMAN INTO THE ROOM TO PERFORM THE CEREMONY IT WOULD BE FUTILE THE INJURY TO THE CHILD CAN NEVER BE REPAIRED AND FOR MYSELF I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY FATE IN LIFE WORSE THAN BEING COMPELLED TO PASS IT WITH YOU
WHOSE FITS OF ILL TEMPER WERE UNDER NO CONTROL AND WHO NEVER WHEN IN THEM CARED WHAT HE SAID TO OUTRAGE THE FEELINGS OF ANOTHER THE TEMPTATION TO SIN AS YOU CALL IT LAY NOT IN MY PERSUASIONS HALF SO MUCH AS IN YOUR JEALOUS ANGER TOWARD YOUR HUSBAND
SETTLING THE LOGS TO HIS APPARENT SATISFACTION TO SPEAK AND ACT LET THERE BE PLAIN TRUTH BETWEEN US AT THIS INTERVIEW IF THERE NEVER HAS BEEN BEFORE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU NAKED TRUTH UNGLOSSED OVER
NOTHING CAN REPAIR THE INJURY IF YOU ONCE SUFFER IT TO COME UPON HIM HE WILL BE A BY WORD AMIDST MEN THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE YOU HAD BETTER HAVE WRITTEN TO THE LAW LORDS TO URGE ON THE DIVORCE HE RETURNED I CANNOT HELP THE DELAY
AND ALL THE TIME THE SLY FOX HAD GOT THE TIMES IN HIS COAT POCKET BUT HE WAS ONLY OBEYING THE ORDERS OF HIS MASTER IT HAD BEEN CAPTAIN LEVISON'S RECENT PLEASURE THAT THE NEWSPAPERS SHOULD NOT BE SEEN BY LADY ISABEL UNTIL HE HAD OVER LOOKED THEM
LADY ISABEL WAITED TILL THE MAN WAS GONE AND THEN SPOKE A FAINT FLUSH OF EMOTION IN HER CHEEKS YOU DO NOT MEAN WHAT YOU SAY YOU WILL NOT LEAVE ME YET I CANNOT DO OTHERWISE HE ANSWERED THERE'S A MOUNTAIN OF BUSINESS TO BE ATTENDED TO
BUT THAT SHE SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE GONE AWAY FROM IT WALKING IN THE FLOWER GARDEN WITH MISTER CARLYLE WHILE THE THREE CHILDREN PLAYED ON THE LAWN HER ARM WAS WITHIN HER HUSBAND'S AND HE WAS RELATING SOMETHING TO HER WHAT THE NEWS WAS SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER AFTERWARD
AND TO MAKE YOU MY WIFE WOULD SO OFFEND ALL MY FAMILY THAT STAY INTERRUPTED LADY ISABEL YOU NEED NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF TO FIND NEEDLESS EXCUSES HAD YOU TAKEN THIS JOURNEY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING ME YOUR WIFE WERE YOU TO PROPOSE TO DO SO THIS DAY
FURNISHED IN THE VICINITY OF THE PLACE GRENETTE A WINDY OLD HOUSE IT WAS FULL OF DOORS AND WINDOWS CHIMNEYS AND CUPBOARDS AND HE SAID HE SHOULD REMAIN THERE LADY ISABEL REMONSTRATED
AND RAN OFF FROM THE ROAD TO LOOK FOR THEM IN THE WOOD BUT MEANTIME THE YOUTH WENT OFF WITH THE THIRD OX NOW WHEN THE MAN CAME BACK AND FOUND HE HAD LOST THIS OX TOO HE WAS SO WILD THAT THERE WAS NO END TO HIS GRIEF HE CRIED AND ROARED AND BEAT HIS BREAST
AND HE TOLD HIS FATHER TO GO TO THE SQUIRE AND ASK FOR HIS DAUGHTER FOR HIM IF HE ASKS BY WHAT TRADE I GET MY LIVING YOU CAN SAY I'M A MASTER THIEF I THINK YOU'VE LOST YOUR WITS SAID THE MAN FOR YOU CAN'T BE IN YOUR RIGHT MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF SUCH STUFF
ALL ADDRESSED TO SKILKANS KNOWN TO BE RAKKEED DISCIPLES AND RABIDLY ANTI TERRAN VON SCHLICHTEN REPLIED WE RADIOED THE LIST TO SKILK COLONEL CHENG LI OUR INTELLIGENCE MAN THERE TELEPRINTED US BACK A LOT OF MATERIAL ON THEM THAT LOOKS LIKE THE NEWGATE CALENDAR
JUST LIKE A GREAT OX IN THE WOOD WHEN THE MAN HEARD THAT YOU CAN'T THINK HOW GLAD HE WAS FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE KNEW THE VOICE OF HIS BIG BULLOCK AND HE THOUGHT THAT NOW HE SHOULD FIND BOTH OF THEM AGAIN
YES THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT SAID THE MASTER THIEF HE SHOULD GO WHETHER HE WOULD OR NO AND IF HE DID NOT GO BY FAIR MEANS HE WOULD SOON MAKE HIM GO BY FOUL BUT THE MAN WAS STILL LOATH TO GO
NO MYSTERY TO THAT VON SCHLICHTEN SAID HE TRAVELS ON OUR SHIPS IN DISGUISE COOLIE CLASS ON THE GEEK DECK BE A GOOD IDEA IF HE COULD BE CAUGHT AT IT SOME TIME BLOUNT SAID MAKING ANOTHER MOVE
FOUR SLAVES BROUGHT UP THE REAR CARRYING AN ORNATELY INLAID BOX ON POLES WHEN THE SPEAR BEARER REACHED THE EXACT MIDDLE OF THE HALL HE HALTED AND GROUNDED HIS REGALIA WEAPON WITH A THUMP
A SURE SIGN THAT HE HAD NOT LONG AGO BEEN EXPOSED TO THE FLUORINE TAINTED AIR WHICH MEN AND GEEKS ALIKE BREATHED ON NIFLHEIM
THAT HE'S STARTED BUILDING TWO NEW POWER REACTORS TO HANDLE THE ADDITIONAL POWER DEMAND THAT'LL RESULT FROM THE INCREASED BUSINESS BLOUNT CONTINUED WHERE'S HE GETTING THE PLUTONIUM VON SCHLICHTEN ASKED WHERE CAN HE GET IT HARRINGTON REPLIED
I WISH WE KNEW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ULLERAN PSYCHOLOGY THAT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME HE'D MADE THAT WISH EVEN IF SEX WEREN'T THE PARAMOUNT PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTOR THE ANCIENT FREUDIANS BELIEVED IT WAS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE
HE WORE A GOLD HELMET AND A THING LIKE A STRING VEST MADE OF GOLD WIRE AND CARRIED A LONG SWORD WITH A TWO HAND GRIP
AYE AYE YOU MAY HANG FOR ALL I CARE WHETHER YOU ARE A GHOST OR WHATEVER YOU ARE SO HE PASSED ON WITH HIS OX NOW THE YOUTH DID JUST AS HE HAD DONE TWICE BEFORE HE JUMPED DOWN FROM THE TREE RAN THROUGH THE WOOD BY A FOOTPATH AND HUNG HIMSELF UP RIGHT IN THE MAN'S WAY AGAIN
SIX MONTHS AGO GURGURK WOULDN'T HAVE TRIED TO PULL ANYTHING LIKE THIS NOW HE'S LAUGHING UP HIS NON EXISTENT SLEEVE AT US THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN PREACHING ALL ALONG ERIC BLOUNT TOOK UP AFTER HIM THESE GEEKS NEED HAVING THE FEAR OF TERRA THROWN INTO THEM
AND HE GETS ALL THE BUSINESS IT'LL BRING TO KEEGARK CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT RAKKEED IS A WELCOME GUEST AT HIS EMBASSY HERE AND AT THE ROYAL PALACE AT KEEGARK I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER IF HE ISN'T FOMENTING TROUBLE FOR US HERE AT KONKROOK TO MAKE US WILLING TO MOVE OUR MAIN BASE TO HIS CITY HE MADE A MOVE INSTANTLY
WELL THIS IS AN UGLY BUSINESS IS IT LIKELY NOW THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO HEAVY AT HEART AS TO HANG THEMSELVES ALL THESE THREE NO I CANNOT THINK IT IS ANYTHING ELSE THAN A PIECE OF WITCHCRAFT THAT I SEE BUT NOW I'LL SOON KNOW FOR CERTAIN
HARRINGTON PUSHED ONE OF HIS PIECES OUT ALONG A RADIAL LINE TOWARD THE RIM BLOUNT PROMPTLY TOOK A PAWN WHICH UNDER ULLERAN RULES ENTITLED HIM TO A SECOND MOVE HE SHIFTED ANOTHER PIECE A SORT OF COMBINATION KNIGHT AND BISHOP TO THREATEN THE PIECE HARRINGTON HAD MOVED
WITHOUT REGARD FOR WHETHER THE VICTIMS HAD EVEN HEARD OF THE CRIME WHICH THEY WERE EXPIATING IF THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL'S RIGHTS ASSOCIATION WERE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THESE GEEKS THEY'D ADVOCATE BOOTING OUT ALL THESE NATIVE PRINCES AND TURNING THE WHOLE PLANET OVER TO THE COMPANY
CAN I GET LEAVE TO HAVE A BED AND SHELTER HERE TO NIGHT ASKED THE YOUTH YOU'LL GET NO GOOD BY SLEEPING HERE SAID THE OLD DAME
AND SIX MORE HAVE JUST VANISHED THERE WELL I'M GOING THERE IN A FEW DAYS MYSELF TO TALK TO ORGZILD ABOUT THIS SPACEPORT DEAL BLOUNT SAID
IF THE OTHER TWO ARE STILL HANGING THERE IT MUST BE REALLY SO BUT IF THEY ARE NOT THEN IT CAN BE NOTHING BUT WITCHCRAFT THAT I SEE SO HE TIED UP HIS OX AND RAN BACK TO SEE IF THE OTHERS WERE STILL REALLY HANGING THERE BUT WHILE HE WENT AND PEERED UP INTO ALL THE TREES
THESE EXTRATERRESTRIALS RIGHTS ASSOCIATION PEOPLE ARE A LOT OF BLASTED FANATICS THEMSELVES WE'RE A GANG OF BLOODY HANDED FLINT HEARTED IMPERIALISTIC SONS OF BITCHES IN THEIR BOOK AND ANYTHING WE SAY'S SURE TO BE A HITLER SIZED LIE
SO THEY SAID TO THE YOUTH IF HE WERE GOOD TO STEAL THE OX FROM THE MAN BY THE WAY WITHOUT HIS KNOWING IT AND WITHOUT DOING HIM ANY HARM THEY WOULD GIVE HIM LEAVE TO BE THEIR SERVING MAN WELL THE YOUTH SET OFF AND TOOK WITH HIM A PRETTY SHOE WITH A SILVER BUCKLE ON IT WHICH LAY ABOUT THE HOUSE
AND HE PUT THE SHOE IN THE ROAD ALONG WHICH THE MAN WAS GOING WITH HIS OX
THAT HE'S A MASTER THIEF AND SO HE FELL TO CRYING AND SOBBING AGAIN
BUT THE ROBBERS KNEW ALL ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID TO THE YOUTH IF HE COULD GET THIS OX TOO WITHOUT THE MAN'S KNOWING IT AND WITHOUT HIS DOING HIM ANY HARM HE SHOULD BE AS GOOD AS ANY ONE OF THEM IF THAT WERE ALL THE YOUTH SAID HE DID NOT THINK IT A VERY HARD THING THIS TIME
AND SO YOU ARE STILL WHEN YOU WON'T TAKE YOUR OWN SON IN WHAT YOU MY SON SAID THE MAN DON'T YOU KNOW ME AGAIN SAID THE YOUTH WELL AFTER A LITTLE WHILE HE DID KNOW HIM AGAIN BUT WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TURNING YOUR HAND TO
ALL PURPOSE PIECES AND TOOK A PIECE THEN MOVED AGAIN NOW LOOK WHOSE KING'S THREATENED HE CROWED YES I SEE BLOUNT BROUGHT A PIECE CLOCKWISE AROUND THE BOARD AND TOOK THE THREATENING PIECE THEN MOVED AGAIN I HOPE YOU SEE WHOSE KING'S THREATENED NOW
AT LEAST ONE OF THE RABBITS HAD BEEN KEPT ON THE PREMISES TOO SOME TIME AGO NO TRACE OF THE GOAT HE WATCHED BLOUNT MOVE ONE OF HIS PIECES AND NODDED APPROVINGLY THE RIOT'S BEEN PUT DOWN HE CONTINUED
IMMEDIATELY BLOUNT TOOK ONE OF HIS PIECES MOVED AGAIN TOOK ANOTHER AND MADE THE THIRD MOVE TO WHICH HE WAS ENTITLED
INDISCRIMINATELY MORE SLAVES FOR JAIKARK'S COURT FAVORITE OF COURSE OR ELSE GURGURK WANTS THEM TO USE FOR PATRONAGE BLOUNT ADDED HE'S BEEN BUILDING QUITE A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION LATELY GETTING READY TO SHOVE JAIKARK OFF THE THRONE I'D SAY
WE TURNED THE LETTERS THEMSELVES OVER TO DOC PETRIE THE ULLERAN PHILOLOGY SHARP WHO IS A PRETTY FAIR CRYPTANALYST HE COULDN'T FIND ANY INDICATIONS OF CIPHER BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF GOSSIP ABOUT KEELUK'S FRIENDS AND PARISHIONERS WHICH MIGHT HAVE ARBITRARY CODE MEANINGS
VON SCHLICHTEN STATED INTELLIGENCE GOT THAT FROM A SPY WE'D PLANTED AMONG THE EMBASSY SERVANTS YOU SURE THIS SPY WASN'T JUST ROMANCING HARRINGTON ASKED YOU GET SO CONFOUNDED MANY WILD STORIES ABOUT RAKKEED
THEN THE YOUTH TOOK UP THE SHOE AND MADE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD TO GET BEFORE THE MAN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE WOOD AND LAID IT DOWN BEFORE HIM IN THE ROAD AGAIN WHEN THE MAN CAME ALONG WITH HIS OX HE GOT QUITE ANGRY WITH HIMSELF FOR BEING SO DULL AS TO LEAVE THE FELLOW TO THE SHOE LYING IN THE ROAD INSTEAD OF TAKING IT WITH HIM
SAID THE OLD DAME THEY STOLE ME AWAY WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND HAVE KEPT ME AS THEIR HOUSEKEEPER EVER SINCE WELL FOR ALL THAT I THINK I'LL JUST GO TO BED SAID THE YOUTH
AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT FOR MYSELF
DID YOU SAY SHE TOLD YOU SHE WAS GOING TO SKILK IN THE NEAR FUTURE HARRINGTON ASKED WELL LOOK HERE YOU'RE GOING UP THAT WAY YOURSELF WITH THAT BATTALION OF KRAGANS ON THE ALDEBARAN WHY DON'T YOU INVITE HER TO MAKE THE TRIP WITH YOU
WHATEVER HEAVY THOUGHTS YOU HAD WHO HAVE HANGED YOURSELF UP THERE IT CAN'T BE HELPED YOU MAY HANG FOR WHAT I CARE I CAN'T BREATHE LIFE INTO YOU AGAIN AND WITH THAT HE WENT ON HIS WAY WITH HIS OX DOWN SLIPPED THE YOUTH FROM THE TREE AND RAN BY A FOOTPATH AND GOT BEFORE THE MAN
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANY OF THE DOZEN ODD COUNTRY GENTLEMAN NEIGHBORS OF VON SCHLICHTEN'S BOYHOOD IN THE ARGENTINE BUT THEN TO A TERRAN ANY OF THE KINGS OF ULLER WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE A FREAK BIRTH IN A LIZARD HOUSE AT A ZOO IT WAS HARD TO GUESS WHAT IMPRESSION HARRINGTON WOULD MAKE ON AN ULLERAN
AND RIGHT GLAD HE WAS TO SEE THEM AS YOU MAY FANCY NEXT HE TOOK ALL THE HORSES WHICH THE ROBBERS HAD AND LOADED THEM WITH THE BEST THINGS HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON GOLD AND SILVER AND CLOTHES AND OTHER FINE THINGS AND THEN HE BADE THE OLD DAME TO GREET THE ROBBERS WHEN THEY CAME BACK AND TO THANK THEM FOR HIM
HE FURNISHES THE LAND SEQUESTERED FROM THE ESTATE OF SOME NOBLE HE EXECUTED FOR TREASON AND THE LABOR ALL FORCED WE FURNISH THE STRUCTURAL STEEL THE MACHINE EQUIPMENT THE ENGINEERING WE GET A SPACEPORT WE DON'T REALLY NEED
AND MANAGING TO HINT THAT THINGS LIKE THAT SIMPLY DIDN'T HAPPEN AT KEEGARK THE PRINCE GORKRINK THEN SPOKE BRIEFLY IN SYMPATHY FOR THE GREAT AND GOOD FRIEND OF ALL ULLERAN PEOPLES MOHAMMED FERRIERA WHO HAD BEEN INJURED AND HOPING THAT HE WOULD SOON ENJOY FULL HEALTH AGAIN
HERE TO MAKE MONEY HONESTLY BY EXCHANGING GOODS AND SERVICES WITH THESE PEOPLE HE TURNED AND WALKED AWAY OUT OF THE AUDIENCE HALL LEAVING VON SCHLICHTEN AND BLOUNT TO WATCH THE REMOVAL OF THE GEEK HEADS YOU KNOW I WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR VON SCHLICHTEN CONFESSED
DID YOU SEE IF HE HAD ANY MONEY SAID THE ROBBERS SUCH A ONE AS HE MONEY SAID THE OLD DAME THE TRAMPER WHY IF HE HAD CLOTHES TO HIS BACK IT WAS AS MUCH AS HE HAD THEN THE ROBBERS BEGAN TO TALK AMONG THEMSELVES WHAT THEY SHOULD DO WITH HIM
AND THEY'RE BEING QUESTIONED NOW BUT I DOUBT IF THEY'LL TELL US ANYTHING WE DON'T KNOW ALREADY THE DOG HAD BEEN KEPT IN A LEAN TO BACK OF THE HOUSE IT HAD BEEN REMOVED PROBABLY AS SOON AS KEELUK CALLED IN HIS GOON GANG
I WONDER JUST WHAT'S GOING ON AT KEEGARK VON SCHLICHTEN SAID ORGZILD'S PULLED DOWN A REGULAR FIRST CENTURY MODEL IRON CURTAIN YOU KNOW FOUR OF OUR BEST NATIVE INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES HAVE BEEN MURDERED IN KEEGARK IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS
WERE HIS SORROW NOT SO OVERWHELMING HE WOULD HAVE COME IN HIS OWN SACRED PERSON TO EXPRESS THE PAIN AND SHAME WHICH HE FEELS THAT PEOPLE OF THE COMPANY SHOULD BE SET UPON AND ENDANGERED IN THE STREETS OF THE ROYAL CITY IF HE WEREN'T DOPED TO THE EARS
WELL AT RISK OF SEEMING HEARTLESS I'M NOT SO MUCH WORRIED FOR STALIN AS I AM ABOUT WHY KEELUK WAS HIDING HIM
FLANKED BY VON SCHLICHTEN AND ERIC BLOUNT HE DIDN'T LOOK PARTICULARLY REGAL EVEN ON THAT HIGH SEAT WITH HIS RUDDY OUTDOORSMAN'S FACE AND HIS RAGGED GRAY MUSTACHE AND HIS OLD TWEED COAT SPOTTED WITH PIPE ASHES
ALL OF THEM CARRIED ABOUT AS MUCH IRONMONGERY AS THE PRIME MINISTER THE PISTOLS WERE ALL TERRAN AND THE SWORDS AND DAGGERS WERE MOSTLY MADE EITHER ON TERRA OR AT THE TERRAN OPERATED STEEL WORKS ON VOLUND
FROM A PRINCELING WHO WAS ALMOST OYSTER GRAY TO OLD GHROGHRANK
BUT JUST THEN IT CAME ACROSS HIS MIND THAT HE WOULD GO HOME AND TAKE THE SECOND OX AND DRIVE IT TO THE TOWN AND NOT LET HIS OLD DAME KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER SO HE DID THIS AND WENT HOME AND TOOK THE OX WITHOUT HIS DAME'S KNOWING IT AND SET OFF WITH IT TO THE TOWN
SO HE STEPPED AFTER HIM AND RUBBED HIM DOWN WITH A GOOD BIRCH CUDGEL AND KEPT ON TILL THE MAN CAME CRYING AND SOBBING INSIDE THE SQUIRE'S DOOR HOW NOW MY MAN WHAT AILS YOU SAID THE SQUIRE SO HE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE STORY HOW HE HAD THREE SONS WHO SET OFF ONE DAY
THE MASTER THIEF ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A POOR COTTAGER WHO HAD THREE SONS HE HAD NOTHING TO LEAVE THEM WHEN HE DIED AND NO MONEY WITH WHICH TO PUT THEM TO ANY TRADE SO THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THEM
WITH OVERTONES OF WEAPON FINGERING ABOUT PRECEDENCE ALL THAT IS BUT GHROGHRANK AND ANOTHER NOBLE WHO CAME UP AND PLANTED THEMSELVES BESIDE GURGURK VON SCHLICHTEN REGARDED THE ASSEMBLAGE SOURLY THROUGH HIS MONOCLE MAYBE SID HARRINGTON DID LOOK REGAL AFTER ALL
RITUAL KILLING HE ASKED OR SYMPATHETIC MAGIC VON SCHLICHTEN SHRUGGED TAKE YOUR CHOICE MAYBE RAKKEED WANTED THE DOG TO KILL BEFORE A CONGREGATION OF HIS FOLLOWERS KILLING US BY PROXY OR IN EFFIGY OR MAYBE THEY THINK WE WORSHIP STALIN
THAT YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF SO GREAT A MAN IN SUCH HASTE ASKED THE MAN OH I'LL SOON TELL YOU SAID THE YOUTH
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WILL RAKKEED LET HIMSELF BE USED THAT WAY I THINK RAKKEED'S BIGGER THAN GURGURK EVER CAN BE AND MORE OF A THREAT TO THE COMPANY EVERYWHERE WE TURN RAKKEED'S AT THE BOTTOM OF WHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE WRONG THIS BUSINESS FOR INSTANCE KEELUK'S ONE OF RAKKEED'S FOLLOWERS
AND A PAIR OF MATCHED DAGGERS HE WAS CONSIDERABLY PAST THE ULLERAN PRIME OF LIFE SEVENTY OR EIGHTY TO JUDGE FROM THE WORN APPEARANCE OF HIS OPAL TEETH THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN
I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION TO MISS QUINTON AND ADVISE HER TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF THE PEOPLE KEELUK GAVE HER LETTERS TO HARRINGTON HAD GOTTEN HIS KING TEMPORARILY OUT OF DANGER LOSING A PIECE DOING IT THINK SHE'LL LISTEN TO YOU HE ASKED
ERIC BLOUNT THEN CONTRIBUTED A SHORT SPEECH BESEECHING THE GODS THAT THE DEEP AND BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN THE CHARTERED ULLER COMPANY AND HIS SUBLIME ETCETERA WOULD CONTINUE UNIMPAIRED AND THAT HIS SUBLIME ETCETERA WOULD ENJOY LONG LIFE AND PEACEFUL REIGN MANAGING
HARRINGTON HAD THE WHITE OR CENTER POSITION BLOUNT SANDY HAIRED AND CONSIDERABLY YOUNGER WAS PLAYING BLACK AND HIS PIECES WERE CLOSING IN RELENTLESSLY FROM THE OUTER RIM WELL THEN WHAT HARRINGTON ASKED
THE THREE TERRANS LOOKED AT THEM GRAVELY A DOUBLE DOZEN HEADS WAS STANDARD PAYMENT FOR AN ATTACK IN WHICH NO TERRAN HAD BEEN KILLED OSTENSIBLY THEY WERE THE HEADS OF THE RINGLEADERS IN PRACTICE THEY WERE USUALLY LOPPED FROM THE FIRST TWO DOZEN PRISONERS OR OVER AGE SLAVES AT HAND
SO WHEN THE MAN CAME BY HE SAW THE SHOE AT ONCE THAT'S A NICE SHOE
HE WALKED AROUND THE RUG TURNING HEADS OVER WITH HIS FOOT
THEY JUST SLASHED OFF TWO DOZEN HEADS AT THE SCENE OF THE RIOT I DON'T LIKE THIS BUTCHERY OF WORN OUT SLAVES AND PETTY THIEVES ANY BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE BUT THIS I DON'T LIKE EITHER
OUR KRAGANS COULD GO THROUGH THAT ARMY OF JAIKARK'S LIKE FAST NEUTRONS THROUGH TOILET PAPER MY GOD HARRINGTON EXPLODED DON'T LET ME HEAR THAT KIND OF TALK AGAIN WE'RE NOT CONQUISTADORES WE'RE EMPLOYEES OF A BUSINESS CONCERN
OH THEY'RE NOT AS BAD AS ALL THAT I NEVER MET THE GIRL BEFORE TODAY BUT OLD MOHAMMED FERRIERA'S A DECENT BLOKE AND THEIR ASSOCIATION'S REALLY DONE A LOT OF GOOD FOR ONE THING THEY PUT AN END TO THE PEONAGE SYSTEM ON YGGDRASILL
A FEW FANATICS HATE US AND A FEW MERCHANTS WHO LOST MONEY WHEN WE REPLACED THIS PRIMITIVE BARTER ECONOMY OF THEIRS BUT NINE TENTHS OF THEM HAVE BENEFITED ENORMOUSLY FROM US AND CONTINUE TO BENEFIT AND HATE US MORE DEEPLY WITH EACH NEW BENEFIT BLOUNT ADDED THEY RESENT EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE FOR THEM
GURGURK SQUEAKED AND CLICKED I HAVE THE HONOR TO BRING WITH ME THE LORD GHROGHRANK AMBASSADOR OF KING ORGZILD OF KEEGARK TO THE COURT OF MY ROYAL MASTER AND I GHROGHRANK SAID AFTER BEING SUITABLY WELCOMED
AND A GUARD OF KRAGAN RIFLES ENTERED THE HONOR GUARD ADVANCED IN TWO COLUMNS BETWEEN THEM MARCHED AN UNCLAD AND HEAVILY ARMED NATIVE CARRYING AN ORNATE SPEAR WITH A THREE FOOT BLADE UPRIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM WITH ALL FOUR HANDS
AT LAST HE SAID HE WOULD GIVE THEM LEAVE TO TAKE TO ANYTHING EACH LIKED BEST AND TO GO WHITHERSOEVER THEY PLEASED AND HE WOULD GO WITH THEM A BIT OF THE WAY AND SO HE DID HE WENT WITH THEM TILL THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THREE ROADS MET AND THERE EACH OF THEM CHOSE A ROAD AND THEIR FATHER BADE THEM GOOD BYE
YOUR KING'S IN DANGER HE WARNED AND HITLER WAS JUST A PAPER HANGER RAKKEED HAS NO FOLLOWING EXCEPT AMONG THE RABBLE HARRINGTON PUFFED FURIOUSLY AT HIS PIPE TRYING TO FIGURE THE BEST PROTECTION FOR HIS KING YOU JUST THINK HE HASN'T BLOUNT RETORTED
THEY KNEW ALL ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID TO THE YOUTH THAT IF HE COULD STEAL THIS OX AS HE HAD STOLEN THE OTHER TWO THEN HE SHOULD BE MASTER OVER THE WHOLE BAND WELL THE YOUTH SET OFF AND RAN INTO THE WOOD AND AS THE MAN CAME BY WITH HIS OX HE SET UP A DREADFUL BELLOWING
HE GOT BEWILDERED AND COULD NOT FIND EITHER ROAD OR PATH BUT AS HE WENT ON AND ON AT LAST HE SAW A GLIMMERING OF LIGHT FAR FAR OFF IN THE WOOD
BLOUNT SAID WHEN THE OUTBREAK COMES JAIKARK WILL BE KILLED AND THEN GURGURK WILL STEP IN SEIZE THE PALACE AND USE THE ROYAL ARMY TO PUT DOWN THE REVOLT THAT HE'S INCITED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WILL PUT HIM IN THE POSITION OF THE FRIEND OF THE COMPANY AND MOST OF HIS DUPES WILL BE ROUNDED UP AND SOLD AS SLAVES
VON SCHLICHTEN TOLD THE SERGEANT THEN HE DISGORGED AND POUCHED HIS GEEK SPEAKER SEE THAT HEAD THERE HE ASKED ROLLING IT OVER WITH HIS TOE I KILLED THAT GEEK MYSELF WITH MY PISTOL
I WON'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING OF COURSE THE INTERCOM SPEAKER ON THE TABLE WHISTLED SEVERAL TIMES HARRINGTON SWORE LAID DOWN HIS PIPE AND GOT UP BRUSHING ASHES FROM THE FRONT OF HIS COAT HE FLIPPED A SWITCH AND SPOKE INTO THE BOX
AND WHICH WAS MADE JUST LIKE A GENERAL'S SO HE DROVE UP TO THE DOOR AS IF HE WERE ANY OTHER GREAT MAN
AS FINALLY IT DID THEY WALKED BACK FROM THE DOOR WHENCE THEY HAD ESCORTED THE DELEGATION AND STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE SAURIAN HEADS ON THE RUG HARRINGTON RAISED HIS VOICE AND CALLED TO A KRAGAN SERGEANT WHOSE CHEVRONS WERE PAINTED ON ALL FOUR ARMS
OH NONSENSE ERIC YOU'RE JUST AS BAD AS CARLOS HERE HARRINGTON TUT TUTTED NEXT YOU'LL BE SAYING THAT WE OUGHT TO DEPOSE JAIKARK AND TAKE CONTROL OURSELVES WELL WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT FOR AN IDEA VON SCHLICHTEN DEMANDED DON'T YOU THINK WE COULD
BUT WHEN THE MAN SAW THIS SIGHT FOR THE THIRD TIME
AND SAW AN OLD DAME BUSTLING ABOUT AND MINDING THE HOUSE GOOD EVENING SAID THE YOUTH GOOD EVENING SAID THE OLD DAME HUTETU IT'S SUCH FOUL WEATHER OUT OF DOORS TO NIGHT SAID HE SO IT IS SAID SHE
SPRAY THE VISITORS WITH BULLETS WITHOUT ENDANGERING THE TERRANS WELCOME GURGURK HARRINGTON GIBBERED THROUGH HIS FALSE PALATE
IF THEY SHOULD KILL HIM OUTRIGHT OR WHAT ELSE THEY SHOULD DO MEANTIME THE YOUTH GOT UP AND BEGAN TO TALK TO THEM
AND FROM THE WATERFRONT BACK TO EIGHTH AVENUE THERE IS ALSO THE EQUIVALENT OF A REGIMENT OF KING JAIKARK'S INFANTRY SPEARMEN CROSSBOWMEN AND A FEW RIFLEMEN AND TWO OF THOSE OUTSIZE CAVALRY COMPANIES OF HIS HELPING HOLD THE LID DOWN THEY'RE MAKING MASS ARRESTS
GURGURK CAME UP AND HALTED A COUPLE OF PACES BEHIND AND TO THE LEFT OF THE SPEAR AND ALL THE OTHER NOBLES DREW UP IN TWO CURVED LINES SOME TEN PACES TO THE REAR
WE'RE SUBSIDIZING JAIKARK RAKKEED HAS BEEN PREACHING THIS CRUSADE AGAINST THE TERRANS AND AGAINST JAIKARK WHOM WE CONTROL GURGURK HAS BEEN SUBSIDIZING RAKKEED YOU HAVEN'T ANY PROOF OF THAT HARRINGTON PROTESTED MY INTELLIGENCE SECTION HAS
GEEK CHORUS AND A SPEECH OF RESPONSE FROM SID HARRINGTON STANDING STIFFLY THROUGH THE WHOLE RIGAMAROLE
AND THEY SET OFF ALL TOGETHER EVERY MAN JACK OF THEM AND LEFT HIM ALONE AT HOME NOW THE FIRST THING THAT HE DID WHEN THEY WERE ALL WELL CLEAR OF THE HOUSE WAS TO DRIVE THE OXEN OUT TO THE ROAD
WHILE THEM AND HID WERE GETTING FERRIERA INTO THE CAR MISS QUINTON KILLED THAT ONE WITH THE BOLO SEE WHERE SHE CHOPPED HIM ON THE BACK OF THE NECK THE CUT THAT TOOK OFF THE HEAD WAS A LITTLE LOW AND MISSED IT
VON SCHLICHTEN NODDED SERIOUSLY DID YOU NOTICE THE GREEN SPECKS IN THE HIDE OF THAT PRINCE GORKRINK HE ASKED
HE ALSO MANAGED TO CONVEY KING ORGZILD'S PLEASURE AT HAVING OBTAINED THE PLUTONIUM
NOT ON THE PRETORIA I DON'T THINK PROBABLY ON THE CANBERRA THREE MONTHS AGO AND HE'S HERE TO GET THAT PLUTONIUM AND SHIP IT TO KEEGARK ON THE OOM PAUL KRUGER BLOUNT CONSIDERED
WELL HAVE YOU A MIND TO STEAL ASKED THE ROBBERS I DON'T CARE SAID THE YOUTH FOR HE THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT TAKE LONG TO LEARN THAT TRADE NOW THERE LIVED A MAN A LITTLE WAY OFF WHO HAD THREE OXEN
OH GURGURK WOULDN'T DARE TRY ANYTHING LIKE THAT THE GOVERNOR GENERAL SAID
HARRINGTON SWORE REACHED OUT TO MOVE A PIECE AND THEN JERKED HIS HAND BACK AS THOUGH THE PIECE WERE RADIOACTIVE FOR A WHILE HE SAT PUFFING HIS PIPE AND STARING AT THE BOARD
I HAVE NEVER HEARD TELL WHAT BECAME OF THE TWO ELDER
VON SCHLICHTEN DROPPED ASH FROM HIS CIGARETTE INTO THE TRAY THAT SERVED ALL THREE OF THEM NOTHING MUCH HE REPLIED KEELUK BUGGED OUT AS SOON AS HE SAW MY CAR LET DOWN WE PICKED UP A FEW OF HIS RAGTAG AND BOBTAIL
THE YOUTH JUMPED DOWN AND TOOK HIS OX AND RAN OFF WITH IT WHEN THE MAN CAME BACK AND FOUND HIS OX GONE HE WAS IN A SAD PLIGHT AND AS ANY ONE MIGHT KNOW WITHOUT BEING TOLD HE BEGAN TO CRY AND BEMOAN BUT AT LAST HE CAME TO TAKE IT EASIER AND SO HE THOUGHT
THE WIDE DOORS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL SLID OPEN
NO THAT HE COULDN'T AT ANY PRICE HOW EVER SHOULD I BE ABLE SAID THE MAN TO MAKE ROOM IN MY HOUSE FOR SUCH A FINE GENTLEMAN I WHO SCARCE HAVE A RAG TO LIE UPON AND MISERABLE RAGS TOO YOU ALWAYS WERE A STINGY OLD HUNKS SAID THE YOUTH
HE PROBABLY HADN'T EVEN HEARD OF THE RIOT THE SOLDIERS OF HIS SUBLIME AND INEFFABLE MAJESTY CAME MOST PROMPTLY TO THE AID OF THE TROOPS OF THE COMPANY DID THEY NOT GENERAL VON SCHLICHTEN HARRINGTON ASKED WITHIN MINUTES YOUR EXCELLENCY
HE TOOK WITH HIM A ROPE AND HUNG HIMSELF UP UNDER THE ARM PITS TO A TREE RIGHT IN THE MAN'S WAY SO THE MAN CAME ALONG WITH HIS OX AND WHEN HE SAW SUCH A SIGHT HANGING THERE HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE QUEER WELL SAID HE
I MAY JUST AS WELL RUN BACK AND PICK UP THE OTHER AND THEN I'LL HAVE A PAIR OF GOOD SHOES FOR MY OLD DAME AND SO PERHAPS I'LL GET A KIND WORD FROM HER FOR ONCE SO HE SET OFF AND HUNTED AND HUNTED UP AND DOWN FOR THE SHOE BUT NO SHOE DID HE FIND
ONE OF THE LOWER DECK LOADING PORTS COULD BE LEFT UNLOCKED BY CARELESSNESS AND HE COULD BLUNDER OVERBOARD AT ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET HE WATCHED HARRINGTON MAKE A DECEPTIVELY POINTLESS LOOKING MOVE SID THIS DAMN DOG BUSINESS WORRIES ME
TO PREVENT OUR FINDING OUT THAT HE HAD HIM A MISTER KEELUK A CLERGYMAN VON SCHLICHTEN QUOTED HE CHAIN LIT ANOTHER CIGARETTE AND STUBBED OUT THE OLD ONE
AND I KNOW WHAT CONDITIONS WERE LIKE THERE BEFORE THEY DID A CALCULATING LOOK CAME INTO HARRINGTON'S EYE HE PUFFED SLOWLY AT HIS PIPE AND SLID A PIECE FROM THE CENTER TOWARD THE SECTOR OF THE BOARD NEAREST HIM BLOUNT WHISTLED SOFTLY AND MADE A QUICK RE ARRANGEMENT CARLOS
AND NOW I'VE SERVED MY TIME OUT AND AM BECOME A MASTER THIEF NOW THERE LIVED A SQUIRE CLOSE BY TO HIS FATHER'S COTTAGE AND HE HAD SUCH A GREAT HOUSE AND SUCH HEAPS OF MONEY HE COULD NOT TELL HOW MUCH HE HAD HE HAD A DAUGHTER TOO AND A SMART AND PRETTY GIRL SHE WAS
HE TOOK THE FALSE PALATE AND TONGUE CLICKER OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED AS AN ENUNCIATOR ULLERAN AND COLLOQUIALLY AS A GEEK SPEAKER OUT OF HIS COAT POCKET AND SHOVED IT INTO HIS MOUTH VON SCHLICHTEN AND BLOUNT PUT IN THEIRS AND HARRINGTON PRESSED THE FLOOR BUTTON WITH HIS TOE
THEN WHY'S GURGURK BEEN SUPPORTING THIS DAMNED RAKKEED BLOUNT WANTED TO KNOW HASTILY INTERPOSING A PIECE GURGURK CAN FOLLOW ONE OF TWO LINES OF POLICY HE CAN UNDERTAKE TO HEAVE JAIKARK OFF THE THRONE AND SEIZE POWER OR HE HAS TO SUPPORT JAIKARK ON THE THRONE
AND ON ULLER MOST OF THE FUNDAMENTAL TERMS OF TERRAN PSYCHOLOGY WERE MEANINGLESS AT THE SAME TIME THE AVERAGE ULLERAN PROBABLY HAD COMPLEXES AND NEUROSES THAT WOULD HAVE HAD FREUD TALKING TO HIMSELF AND THEY CERTAINLY INDULGED IN PRACTICES THAT WOULD HAVE
AND TO TELL THE TRUTH IT WAS MANY DAYS BEFORE HE DARED GO HOME FOR HE WAS AFRAID LEST HIS OLD DAME SHOULD KILL HIM OUTRIGHT ON THE SPOT AS FOR THE ROBBERS THEY WERE NOT VERY WELL PLEASED EITHER WHEN THEY HAD TO OWN THAT THE YOUTH WAS MASTER OVER THE WHOLE BAND SO ONE DAY
AND HUNG HIMSELF UP RIGHT IN HIS WAY AGAIN BLESS ME SAID THE MAN WERE YOU REALLY SO HEAVY AT HEART THAT YOU HANGED YOURSELF UP THERE
THERE'S NO OTHER HELP FOR IT THAN TO GO HOME AND TAKE THE THIRD OX WITHOUT MY DAME'S KNOWING IT AND TO TRY AND DRIVE A GOOD BARGAIN WITH IT SO THAT I MAY GET A GOOD SUM OF MONEY FOR IT SO HE WENT HOME AND SET OFF WITH THE OX AND HIS OLD DAME KNEW NEVER A WORD ABOUT THE MATTER BUT THE ROBBERS
HE JUST BOUGHT FOUR TONS OF IT FROM US OFF THE CITY OF PRETORIA THAT'S A HELL OF A LOT OF PLUTONIUM BLOUNT SAID I WONDER IF HE MIGHTN'T HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT ELSE PLUTONIUM CAN BE USED FOR BESIDE GENERATING POWER OH GOD I HOPE NOT HARRINGTON EXCLAIMED
AND THE PREDOMINANTLY REDDISH TINT OF HIS QUARTZ SPECKLES AN IMMATURE ULLERAN WOULD BE A VERY LIGHT GRAY WHITE UNDER THE ARMS AND HIS QUARTZ SPECKS WOULD RUN FROM WHITE TO PALE YELLOW THE RETINUE OF NOBLES BEHIND GURGURK RAN THROUGH THE WHOLE SPECTRUM
VON SCHLICHTEN REPLIED GRAVELY THEIR PROMPTNESS VALOR AND EFFICIENCY WERE MOST EXEMPLARY GURGURK SPOKE AT LENGTH EXPRESSING HIMSELF AS DELIGHTED ON BEHALF OF HIS ROYAL MASTER AT HEARING SUCH HIGH PRAISE FROM SO DISTINGUISHED A SOLDIER
ERIC YOU HAVE RAKKEED ON THE BRAIN HARRINGTON EXCLAIMED IMPATIENTLY THEN MOVED THE THREATENED PIECE COUNTERCLOCKWISE ON THE CIRCLE WHERE HE HAD PLACED IT HE'S JUST A BARBARIAN CARAVAN DRIVER ERIC BLOUNT MOVED THE PIECE THAT HAD TAKEN HARRINGTON'S PAWN
HE DID SO FOR ONLY ONE PURPOSE TO LEARN TERRAN TECHNOLOGIES GURGURK THEN ANNOUNCED THAT SO ENORMOUS A CRIME AGAINST THE FRIENDS OF HIS SUBLIME ETCETERA HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO GO UNPUNISHED SIGNALING BEHIND HIM WITH ONE OF HIS LOWER HANDS FOR THE BOX TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD
YES THIS SPACEPORT PROPOSITION OF KING ORGZILD OF KEEGARK LOOKS LIKE IT NOW DOESN'T IT HARRINGTON RETORTED HE HATES AND RESENTS US SO MUCH THAT HE'S OFFERED US A SPACEPORT AT HIS CITY WHAT'S IT GOING TO COST HIM BLOUNT ASKED
EVEN STOOD KRAFFT EBING'S HAIR ON END ONE THING BLOUNT SAID IT DOESN'T TAKE ANY ULLERAN PSYCHOLOGIST TO KNOW THAT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM HATE US POISONOUSLY OH RUBBISH HARRINGTON BLEW THE EXCLAMATION OUT AROUND HIS PIPE STEM WITH A GUSH OF SMOKE
WHO IS IN YOUR CITY TO RECEIVE THE SHIPMENT OF POWER METAL MY ROYAL MASTER HAS BEEN HONORED TO BE PERMITTED TO PURCHASE FROM THE COMPANY MORE PROTOCOL ABOUT WELCOMING GORKRINK THEN GURGURK CLEARED HIS THROAT WITH A SERIES OF BARKING SOUNDS
THAT HAD BEEN THE TERRAN FEDERATION'S IDEA FROM THE BEGINNING WHY ELSE GIVE THE COMPANY'S CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE THE TITLE OF GOVERNOR GENERAL THERE WAS ANOTHER LONG SPEECH FROM GURGURK WITH THE NOBLES BEHIND HIM MURMURING ANTIPHONAL AGREEMENT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR WHICH THERE WAS A STANDARD PUN
PERHAPS TO DISLODGE A FLY FAR AHEAD OF ITS SEASON LIGHT HAD JUST FILMED THE WINDOWS AND WITH THAT THE FIRST SPARROW WOKE CHIRPED INSTANTLY AND ROUSED NEIGHBOURS IN THE TREES OF THE SMALL YARD INCLUDING A LOUD VOICED ROBIN
A FEW MINUTES LATER HE HEARD HER SPEAKING TO SOMEONE BENEATH HIS WINDOW AND LOOKING OUT SAW HER DIRECTING THE REMOVAL OF PLANTS FROM A SMALL GARDEN BED TO THE MAJOR'S CONSERVATORY FOR THE WINTER THERE WAS AN AIR OF BRISKNESS ABOUT HER
AT TEN MINUTES OF THREE PEERING THROUGH THE CURTAIN HE SAW AN AUTOMOBILE STOP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND EUGENE MORGAN JUMP LIGHTLY DOWN FROM IT THE CAR WAS OF A NEW PATTERN LOW AND LONG WITH AN AMPLE SEAT IN THE TONNEAU FACING FORWARD AND A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER SAT AT THE WHEEL
ALL IN FAVOUR OF ME BEING PRESIDENT INSTEAD OF FRED KINNEY SHOUTED GEORGIE SAY AYE THE AYES HAVE IT I RESIGN SAID THE RED HEADED BOY GULPING AS HE DESCENDED FROM THE PLATFORM I RESIGN FROM THE CLUB
A CHEERFUL WHISTLER PASSED THE HOUSE EVEN MORE CARELESS OF SLEEPERS THAN THE MILKMAN'S HORSE HAD BEEN THEN A GROUP OF COLOURED WORKMEN CAME BY
DON'T YOU CALL THAT HINTING MISSUS ADAMS TURNED TOWARD HIM NOW
NOW I DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'S ANY MORE BUSINESS BEFORE THE MEETING I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL PLAY CARDS ANYBODY THAT'S GAME FOR A LITTLE QUARTER LIMIT POKER OR ANY LIMIT THEY SAY WHY I'D LIKE TO HAVE EM SIT AT THE PRESIDENT'S CARD TABLE
BEST CROWD THERE FINEST SET OF MEN I EVER MET HOW'D YOU GET IN WITH EM GEORGIE LAUGHED I LET THEM GET IN WITH ME CHARLIE HE SAID IN A TONE OF GENTLE EXPLANATION IT'S VULGAR TO DO ANY OTHER WAY DID I TELL YOU THE NICKNAME THEY GAVE ME
HERE GEORGIE MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR AND HIS TONE BECAME PLAINTIVE THOUGH UNDENIABLY THERE WAS DISDAIN BENEATH HIS SORROW I GUESS ALL I BETTER DO IS RESIGN AND HE OPENED THE DOOR APPARENTLY INTENDING TO WITHDRAW ALL IN FAVOUR OF HAVING A NEW ELECTION
A DISGUSTED HARDWARE DEALER OF MIDDLE AGE ONE OF THOSE WHO HUNGERED FOR GEORGIE'S DOWNFALL WAS THUS DRIVEN BACK UPON THE SIDEWALK TO AVOID BEING RUN OVER AND SO FAR FORGOT HIMSELF AS TO MAKE USE OF THE PET STREET INSULT OF THE YEAR
OH YOU'RE BETTER AGAIN I CAN SEE THAT AS SOON AS I LOOK AT YOU SHE SAID MISS PERRY TELLS ME YOU'VE HAD ANOTHER SPLENDID NIGHT HE MADE A SOUND OF IRONY WHICH SEEMED TO DISPOSE UNFAVOURABLY OF MISS PERRY AND THEN IN ORDER TO BE MORE CERTAINLY INTELLIGIBLE HE ADDED
YOU PUT DOWN THAT GAVEL SAID GEORGE WHOSE IS IT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IT BELONGS TO MY GRANDFATHER AND YOU QUIT HAMMERING IT THAT WAY OR YOU'LL BREAK IT AND I'LL HAVE TO KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF THIS MEETING WILL COME TO ORDER I WAS LEGALLY ELECTED HERE AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE BULLDOZED ALL RIGHT SAID GEORGIE
LISTEN TO THE DARN BRUTE WHAT'S HE CARE WHO WANTS TO SLEEP HIS COMPLAINT WAS OF THE HORSE WHO CASUALLY SHIFTED WEIGHT WITH A CLINK OF STEEL SHOES ON THE WORN BRICK PAVEMENT OF THE STREET AND THEN HEARTILY SHOOK HIMSELF IN HIS HARNESS
DON'T TELL ME SO FOR I CAN'T BEAR IT HE LOOKED UP AT HER FIERCELY YOU'VE GOT A FINE WAY TO CURE A SICK MAN HE SAID BUT SHE HAD CONCLUDED HER APPEAL FOR THAT TIME AND INSTEAD OF MAKING ANY MORE WORDS IN THE MATTER
THOUGH GROWING GAUNT WITH FEEDING UPON ITSELF FOR ALTHOUGH GEORGIE'S POMPOSITIES AND IMPUDENCE IN THE LITTLE SCHOOL WERE OFTEN ALMOST UNBEARABLE THE TEACHERS WERE FASCINATED BY HIM THEY DID NOT LIKE HIM HE WAS TOO ARROGANT FOR THAT
AND WITH THE LAST WORD HE CLOSED THE DOOR IN EUGENE'S FACE THEN NOT MOVING AWAY HE STOOD JUST INSIDE DOOR AND NOTED THAT THE MISTY SILHOUETTE REMAINED UPON THE FROSTED GLASS FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS
GEORGIE ADDRESSED THE MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO GOT UP THIS THING IN THE FIRST PLACE HE SAID
BUT THE NEXT INSTANT SHE SAW WHOSE LIKENESS WAS THUS SET FORTH IN ELEGIAC SPLENDOUR AND SHE WAS SILENT EXCEPT FOR A LONG JUST AUDIBLE OH HE NEITHER LOOKED UP NOR MOVED
STILL SHOWED A THIN GLIMMERING THAT HAD GROWN OFFENSIVE TO ADAMS IN HIS WANDERING AND ENFEEBLED THOUGHTS WHICH WERE MUCH MORE OFTEN IMAGININGS THAN REASONINGS THE ATTEMPT OF THE NIGHT LIGHT TO RESIST THE DAWN REMINDED HIM OF SOMETHING UNPLEASANT
AND SHE WAS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW EXPECTANTLY A LITTLE TROUBLED HE WENT BACK TO THE LIBRARY WAITED AN INTERMINABLE HALF HOUR THEN RETURNED NOISELESSLY TO THE SAME POSITION IN THE HALL WHERE HE COULD SEE HER SHE WAS STILL SITTING PATIENTLY BY THE WINDOW
OWL CARS BRINGING IN LAST PASSENGERS OVER DISTANT TROLLEY LINES NOW AND THEN HOWLED ON A CURVE FARAWAY METALLIC STIRRINGS COULD BE HEARD FROM FACTORIES IN THE SOOTY SUBURBS ON THE PLAIN OUTSIDE THE CITY
A STRANGE FIGURE IN LEATHER GOGGLED OUT OF ALL PERSONALITY AND SEEMINGLY PART OF THE MECHANISM EUGENE HIMSELF AS HE CAME UP THE CEMENT PATH TO THE HOUSE WAS A FIGURE OF THE NEW ERA WHICH WAS IN TIME TO BE SO DISASTROUS TO STIFF HATS AND SKIRTED COATS
THE MILKMAN CARRIED HIS JARS ROUND TO THE BACK PORCH WHILE THE HORSE MOVED SLOWLY AHEAD TO THE GATE OF THE NEXT CUSTOMER AND WAITED THERE HE'S GONE INTO POLLOCKS ADAMS THOUGHT FOLLOWING THIS PROGRESS I HOPE IT'LL SOUR ON EM BEFORE BREAKFAST DELIVERED THE ANDERSONS
EUGENE GOT INTO HIS CAR SLOWLY NOT LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE WHICH HAD JUST TAUGHT HIM SUCH A LESSON AND IT WAS EASILY VISIBLE EVEN FROM A WINDOW SEVENTY FEET DISTANT
EUGENE THIS AFTERNOON WAS RICHLY IN THE NEW OUTDOOR MODE
SHOULD BEGIN TO DEIFY HIM NOW THAT HE WAS DEAD POOR POOR FATHER THE SON WHISPERED BROKENLY POOR MAN I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T KNOW HE WRAPPED THE PICTURE IN A SHEET OF NEWSPAPER PUT IT UNDER HIS ARM AND LEAVING THE HOUSE HURRIEDLY AND STEALTHILY
THEN FINDING NONE COMMANDED HIMSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO SHOUT AFTER THE RAPID DOG CART TURN DOWN YOUR PANTS YOU WOULD BE DUDE RAINING IN DEAR OLE LUNNON GIT OFF THE EARTH GEORGIE GAVE HIM NO ENCOURAGEMENT TO THINK THAT HE WAS HEARD
WHO GOT THIS ROOM RENT FREE WHO GOT THE JANITOR TO LET US HAVE MOST OF THIS FURNITURE YOU SUPPOSE YOU COULD KEEP THIS CLUBROOM A MINUTE IF I TOLD MY GRANDFATHER I DIDN'T WANT IT FOR A LITERARY CLUB ANY MORE I'D LIKE TO SAY A WORD ON HOW YOU MEMBERS BEEN ACTING TOO
THERE SEEM TO BE A GREAT MANY OF THEM ISABEL MUSED WHAT DID YOURS WANT TO SELL GEORGE HE DIDN'T SAY YOU MUST HAVE CUT HIM OFF SHORT SHE LAUGHED AND THEN STILL STANDING IN THE DOORWAY SHE NOTICED THE BIG SILVER FRAME UPON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM
HE'LL BE AROUND BOOT LICKIN TO GET US TO TAKE HIM BACK IN AGAIN BUT I GUESS WE DON'T WANT HIM THAT FELLOW ALWAYS WAS A TROUBLE MAKER WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH OUR MEETING
AND UPON THIS STIMULATION SHE SPOKE MORE URGENTLY YOU JUST MUSTN'T GO BACK TO IT VIRGIL IT'S NOT FAIR TO ANY OF US AND YOU KNOW IT ISN'T DON'T TELL ME WHAT I KNOW PLEASE SHE CLASPED HER HANDS SUDDENLY CARRYING HER URGENCY TO PLAINTIVE ENTREATY
EAST WEST AND SOUTH SWITCH ENGINES CHUGGED AND SNORTED ON SIDINGS AND EVERYWHERE IN THE AIR THERE SEEMED TO BE A FAINT VOLUMINOUS HUM AS OF INNUMERABLE WIRES TREMBLING OVERHEAD TO VIBRATION OF MACHINERY UNDERGROUND
GRACIOUS GEORGIE SHE EXCLAIMED YOU HAVE BEEN INVESTING AND AS SHE CAME ACROSS THE ROOM FOR A CLOSER VIEW IS IT IS IT LUCY SHE ASKED HALF TIMIDLY HALF ARCHLY
THE ROOM MOST USED BY ISABEL AND FANNY AND HIMSELF THEN HE WENT TO A FRONT WINDOW OF THE LONG RECEPTION ROOM AND SAT LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE LACE CURTAINS THE HOUSE WAS QUIET THOUGH ONCE OR TWICE HE HEARD HIS MOTHER AND FANNY MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS
OH BUT THAT WOULD BE WORTH SOMETHING TO SEE THEY WERE MISTAKEN IT APPEARED FOR WHEN GEORGIE RETURNED A FEW MONTHS LATER HE STILL SEEMED TO HAVE THE SAME STUFFING HE HAD BEEN DEPORTED BY THE AUTHORITIES THE OFFENSE BEING STATED AS INSOLENCE AND PROFANITY
IT WAS A MYSTERIOUS DOOR ITS UPPER HALF OF OPAQUE GLASS BEARING NO SIGN TO STATE THE BUSINESS OR PROFESSION OF THE OCCUPANTS WITHIN BUT OVERHEAD UPON THE LINTEL FOUR LETTERS HAD BEEN SMEARINGLY INSCRIBED PARTLY WITH PURPLE INK AND PARTLY WITH A SOFT LEAD PENCIL
INSTEAD SHE WENT TO THE BAY WINDOW AT THE END OF THE ROOM WHICH AFFORDED A VIEW OF THE STREET AND GLANCED OUT EXPECTANTLY THEN BENT HER ATTENTION UPON HER GLOVE AFTER THAT LOOKED OUT TOWARD THE STREET AGAIN CEASED TO WHISTLE AND TURNED TOWARD THE INTERIOR OF THE ROOM
BUT HE HAD NOT GOT HIS COME UPANCE AND THOSE WHO COUNTED UPON IT WERE EMBITTERED BY HIS APPEARANCE UPON THE DOWN TOWN STREETS DRIVING A DOG CART AT CRIMINAL SPEED MAKING PEDESTRIANS RETREAT FROM THE CROSSINGS AND BEHAVING GENERALLY AS IF HE OWNED THE EARTH
LOOK HERE CHARLIE JOHNSON WHAT'S FRED KINNEY DOING IN THE PRESIDENT'S CHAIR THAT'S MY PLACE ISN'T IT WHAT YOU MEN BEEN UP TO HERE ANYHOW DIDN'T YOU ALL AGREE I WAS TO BE PRESIDENT JUST THE SAME EVEN IF I WAS AWAY AT SCHOOL WELL SAID CHARLIE JOHNSON UNEASILY
OH YOU ARE ARE YOU SAID GEORGE SKEPTICALLY CHARLIE JOHNSON THOUGHT TO MOLLIFY HIM WELL DIDN'T WE CALL THIS MEETING JUST ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU TOLD US TO
THE PRESIDENT DE FACTO HAMMERED THE TABLE THIS MEETING WILL NOW PROCEED TO NO IT WON'T SAID GEORGE AND HE ADVANCED TO THE DESK LAUGHING CONTEMPTUOUSLY GET OFF THAT PLATFORM THIS MEETING WILL COME TO ORDER MISTER KINNEY COMMANDED FIERCELY
YOU MUSTN'T LET YOURSELF GET NERVOUS SHE SAID BUT OF COURSE WHEN YOU GET WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO YOU MUSTN'T GO BACK TO THAT OLD HOLE AGAIN OLD HOLE THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL IT IS IT IN SPITE OF HIS WEAKNESS ANGER MADE HIS VOICE STRIDENT
UPON THIS HIS EXPRESSION BECAME THAT OF A MAN GOADED OUT OF OVERPOWERING WEARINESS INTO IRONY SLEEP OH CERTAINLY THANK YOU HOWEVER HE DID SLEEP INTERMITTENTLY
ESPECIALLY IF HIS TEMPER BE GENIAL EUGENE HAD BEGUN TO LOOK LIKE A MILLIONAIRE BUT ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE
AS SHE TURNED AWAY TO GO INTO THE HOUSE SHE LAUGHED GAILY WITH THE MAJOR'S GARDENER OVER SOMETHING HE SAID AND THIS UNCONCERNED CHEERFULNESS OF HER WAS TERRIBLE TO HER SON HE WENT TO HIS DESK AND SEARCHING THE JUMBLED CONTENTS OF A DRAWER
WHAT IS THE THE DIFFICULTY GEORGE KEPT HIS OWN VOICE QUIET ENOUGH BUT THAT DID NOT MITIGATE THE VIBRANT FURY OF IT
AND TWO VEILS ROUND HER SMALL BLACK HAT HER RIGHT HAND ENGAGED IN BUTTONING THE GLOVE UPON HER LEFT AND AS THE LARGE ROOM CONTAINED TOO MANY PIECES OF HEAVY FURNITURE AND THE INSIDE SHUTTERS EXCLUDED MOST OF THE LIGHT OF DAY SHE DID NOT AT ONCE PERCEIVE GEORGE'S PRESENCE
AND A CLUTTER OF MONTHLY MAGAZINES AND ILLUSTRATED WEEKLIES OF ABOUT THAT CRISPNESS ONE FINDS IN SUCH ARTICLES UPON A DOCTOR'S ANTE ROOM TABLE UPON THE WALL ABOVE THE SIDEBOARD WAS AN OLD FRAMED LITHOGRAPH OF MISS DELLA FOX IN WANG
LET HIM SEE THAT THERE WERE TEARS IN HER EYES SHOOK HER HEAD AND LEFT THE ROOM ALONE HE LAY BREATHING RAPIDLY HIS EMACIATED CHEST PROVING ITSELF EQUAL TO THE DEMANDS HIS EMOTION PUT UPON IT FINE HE REPEATED WITH HUSKY INDIGNATION
AND GEORGIE DECIDED TO TAKE SOME OF THESE WITH HIM IF HE SHOULD EVER GO TO COLLEGE HOWEVER HE DID NOT STOP TO COLLECT THEM AT THIS TIME BUT CLIMBED THE WORN STAIRS THERE WAS NO ELEVATOR TO THE FOURTH FLOOR WENT DOWN A DARK CORRIDOR AND RAPPED THREE TIMES UPON A DOOR
BUT AT FIFTY FIVE HE MERELY HATED THEM BECAUSE THEY KEPT HIM AWAKE THEY PRESSED ON HIS NERVES AS HE PUT IT AND SO DID ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER HE HEARD THE MILK WAGON DRIVE INTO THE CROSS STREET BENEATH HIS WINDOWS AND STOP AT EACH HOUSE
SHE EXHIBITED TO HIM A FACE MISMODELLED BY SLEEP
THAT WAS WHEN ALL THIS FLAT CENTRAL COUNTRY WAS SWAMPISH AND HADN'T BEEN DRAINED OFF YET
TO SKETCH THE PAINFUL LITTLE SYNOPSIS OF AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN SPITE OF NOISES WITHOUT HE DROWSED AGAIN NOT KNOWING THAT HE DID AND WHEN HE OPENED HIS EYES THE NURSE WAS JUST RISING FROM HER COT HE TOOK NO PLEASURE IN THE SIGHT IT MAY BE SAID
FOR THOUGH SHE SPOKE WITH WHAT SEEMED BUT A CASUAL CHEERFULNESS THERE WAS A LITTLE BETRAYING BREAK IN HER VOICE A TREMBLING JUST PERCEPTIBLE IN THE UTTERANCE OF THE FINAL WORD
WELL ISN'T THAT GRAND WE'VE HAD ANOTHER GOOD NIGHT SHE SAID AS SHE DEPARTED TO DRESS IN THE BATHROOM YES YOU HAD ANOTHER HE RETORTED THOUGH NOT UNTIL AFTER SHE HAD CLOSED THE DOOR
AND A HALF PETRIFIED SECTION OF ICING CAKE ON A SOOTY PLATE AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WERE TWO RICKETY CARD TABLES AND A STAND OF BOOKSHELVES
SHE SLEPT WELL AS USUAL BUT HIS WIFE'S SMILE PERSISTED IT'S A GOOD SIGN TO BE CROSS IT MEANS YOU'RE PRACTICALLY CONVALESCENT RIGHT NOW OH I AM AM I NO DOUBT IN THE WORLD SHE EXCLAIMED WHY YOU'RE PRACTICALLY A WELL MAN VIRGIL
THE ANTICIPATION IN HIS EYES COULD HAVE BEEN READ BY A STRANGER HIS LOOK AT THE DOOR OF ISABEL'S HOUSE WAS THE LOOK OF A MAN WHO IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE NEXT MOMENT WILL REVEAL SOMETHING INEFFABLY CHARMING INEXPRESSIBLY DEAR
MEANWHILE HE STARED HARD AT HER HIS LIPS BEGINNING TO MOVE WITH LITTLE DISTORTIONS NOT LACKING IN THE PATHOS OF A SICK MAN'S AGITATION SO THAT'S IT HE SAID THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HINTING AT HINTING
OBSERVING THE HEAVINESS OF HIS MOVEMENTS AS HE CLIMBED INTO THE TONNEAU GEORGE INDULGED IN A SICKISH THROAT RUMBLE WHICH BORE A DISTANT COUSINSHIP TO MIRTH THE CAR WAS QUICKER THAN ITS OWNER IT SHOT AWAY AS SOON AS HE HAD SUNK INTO HIS SEAT
THE WORDS BECAME INDISTINCT THE AIR WAS HUMMED ABSENTLY THE HUMMING SHIFTED TO A WHISTLE THEN DRIFTED OUT OF HEARING AND THE PLACE WAS STILL AGAIN GEORGE LOOKED OFTEN AT HIS WATCH BUT HIS VIGIL DID NOT LAST AN HOUR
WITH A COMPREHENSION NOT OFTEN SHOWN BY THE PUPILS THEY TAUGHT AND HE PASSED HIS EXAMINATIONS EASILY IN ALL WITHOUT DISCERNIBLE EFFORT HE ACQUIRED AT THIS SCHOOL SOME RUDIMENTS OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION AND LEARNED NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT HIMSELF
AND SHE STILL KEPT UP THE AFFECTATION OF BEING HELPFULLY PREOCCUPIED WITH THE TABLE AND DID NOT LOOK AT HER HUSBAND PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN MARRIED SO MANY YEARS
AND SO KNEW THAT SHE HAD RISEN HE HOPED SHE WOULD COME IN TO SEE HIM SOON FOR SHE WAS THE ONE THING THAT DIDN'T PRESS ON HIS NERVES HE FELT THOUGH THE THOUGHT OF HER HURT HIM AS INDEED EVERY THOUGHT HURT HIM BUT IT WAS HIS WIFE WHO CAME FIRST
NOW LET'S JUST SOBER DOWN AND BE A GOOD BOY AND GET SOME NICE SOUND SLEEP SHE GAVE HIM HIS MEDICINE AND HAVING SET THE GLASS UPON THE CENTER TABLE RETURNED TO HER COT WHERE AFTER A STILL INTERVAL SHE SNORED FAINTLY
EVEN WITH BECOMING HINT OF JAUNTINESS
AND WHAT YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART YOU OUGHT TO AND IF YOU HAVE GOT INTO ONE OF YOUR STUBBORN FITS
HOT EYED HE FOUND HIS HAT AND DEPARTED JEERS ECHOING AFTER HIM AS HE PLUNGED DOWN THE CORRIDOR GEORGIE STEPPED UPON THE PLATFORM AND TOOK UP THE EMBLEM OF OFFICE OLE RED HEAD FRED'LL BE AROUND NEXT WEEK SAID THE NEW CHAIRMAN
WHEN THE DIVERSIONS OF THE FRIENDS OF THE ACE WERE CONCLUDED FOR THAT AFTERNOON GEORGIE INVITED HIS CHIEF SUPPORTER MISTER CHARLIE JOHNSON TO DRIVE HOME WITH HIM TO DINNER AND AS THEY JINGLED UP NATIONAL AVENUE IN THE DOG CART CHARLIE ASKED WHAT SORT OF MEN DID YOU RUN UP AGAINST AT THAT SCHOOL GEORGE
AND THEN HER VOICE RESPONDING YES OH IT'S YOU INDEED I SHOULD OF COURSE THEN I'LL EXPECT YOU ABOUT THREE YES GOOD BYE TILL THEN
FINE WAY TO CURE A SICK MAN FINE THEN AFTER A SILENCE HE GAVE FORTH WHISPERING SOUNDS AS OF LAUGHTER HIS EXPRESSION THE WHILE REMAINING SORE AND FAR FROM HUMOUR AND GIVE US OUR DAILY BREAD HE ADDED
KEEP OUT OF THE NIGHT AIR VIRGIL SHE'D SAY KEEP OUT OF THE NIGHT AIR I EXPECT PROBABLY HER MOTHER TOLD HER THE SAME THING THE NURSE SUGGESTED OF COURSE SHE DID MY GRANDMOTHER OH I GUESS YOUR GRAN DMOTHER THOUGHT SO MISTER ADAMS
AND BRING SOME PORT WINE LIKE WE DRINK AT SCHOOL IN OUR CROWD THERE AND I WAS GOING TO GET MY GRANDFATHER TO GIVE THE CLUB AN EXTRA ROOM ACROSS THE HALL AND PROB'LY I COULD GET MY UNCLE GEORGE TO GIVE US HIS OLD BILLIARD TABLE BECAUSE HE'S GOT A NEW ONE AND THE CLUB COULD PUT IT IN THE OTHER ROOM WELL YOU GOT A NEW PRESIDENT NOW
SUCH AS HE HAD LATELY SEEN IN NEW YORK WHEN HE STOPPED THERE FOR A FEW DAYS OF RECREATION AND REST ON HIS WAY HOME FROM THE BEREAVED SCHOOL ABOUT THE ENTRYWAY TO THE STAIRS WERE VARIOUS TIN SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE OCCUPATION AND LOCATION OF UPPER FLOOR TENANTS
HE WARNED HER RESENTFULLY EVEN A CHILD IF IT HAD JUST ORDINARY GUMPTION OUGHT TO KNOW ENOUGH NOT TO LET THE NIGHT AIR BLOW ON SICK PEOPLE YES NOR WELL PEOPLE EITHER KEEP OUT OF THE NIGHT AIR NO MATTER HOW WELL YOU FEEL THAT'S WHAT MY MOTHER USED TO TELL ME WHEN I WAS A BOY

DROWSED BETWEEN TIMES AND EVEN DREAMED BUT FORGETTING HIS DREAMS BEFORE HE OPENED HIS EYES AND HAVING SOME PART OF HIM ALL THE WHILE AWARE OF HIS DISCOMFORT HE BELIEVED AS USUAL THAT HE LAY AWAKE THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG
SLEEP DANG LIKELY NOW AIN'T IT NIGHT SOUNDS WERE BECOMING DAY SOUNDS THE FAR AWAY HOOTING OF FREIGHT ENGINES SEEMED BRISKER THAN AN HOUR AGO IN THE DARK
KING MINAFER HOW'D THEY HAPPEN TO DO THAT HIS FRIEND ASKED INNOCENTLY
EUGENE GAVE HIM A STEADY LOOK
AN ARM OUTSTRETCHED TOWARD THE BELL AS IF THE GENTLEMAN OUTSIDE DOUBTED WHETHER OR NOT IT HAD SOUNDED AND WERE MINDED TO TRY AGAIN BUT BEFORE THE GESTURE WAS COMPLETED GEORGE ABRUPTLY THREW OPEN THE DOOR AND STEPPED SQUARELY UPON THE MIDDLE OF THE THRESHOLD
THEN AS GENTLY WITHDREW IT AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM BUT SHE DID NOT GO UPSTAIRS HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLE OF HER DRESS IN THE HALL AND THEN THE SOUND OF HER FOOTSTEPS IN THE RECEPTION ROOM
F O T A AND UPON THE PLASTER WALL ABOVE THE LINTEL THERE WAS A DRAWING DEAR TO MALE ADOLESCENCE A SKULL AND CROSSBONES THREE RAPS SIMILAR TO GEORGIE'S SOUNDED FROM WITHIN THE ROOM
A TINKLING BELL WAS AUDIBLE AND SHE MOVED TO THE DOORWAY INTO THE HALL I'M GOING OUT DRIVING DEAR I SHE INTERRUPTED HERSELF TO ADDRESS THE HOUSEMAID WHO WAS PASSING THROUGH THE HALL I THINK IT'S MISTER MORGAN MARY TELL HIM I'LL BE THERE AT ONCE YES MA'AM

ROBINSON CRUSOE SAPPHO MISTER BARNES OF NEW YORK A WORK BY GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO A BIBLE THE ARABIAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENT STUDIES OF THE HUMAN FORM DIVINE THE LITTLE MINISTER
A ROUND SHIELD WITH TWO BATTLE AXES AND TWO CROSS HILTED SWORDS UPON THE WALL OVER THE LITTLE PLATFORM WHERE STOOD THE RED HAIRED PRESIDING OFFICER HE ADDRESSED GEORGIE IN A SERIOUS VOICE WELCOME FRIEND OF THE ACE WELCOME FRIEND OF THE ACE GEORGIE RESPONDED
TURNED A BOOK OVER SO THAT IT LAY UPON ITS OTHER SIDE AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS OCCUPIED HERSELF WITH SIMILAR FUTILITIES HAVING TAKEN ON THE AIR OF A PERSON WHO MAKES THINGS NEAT THOUGH SHE PRODUCED NO SUCH ACTUAL EFFECT UPON THEM OF COURSE YOU WILL SHE REPEATED ABSENTLY
LOOSE ABORIGINAL LAUGHTER PRECEDED THEM AFAR AND BEAT ON THE AIR LONG AFTER THEY HAD GONE BY THE SICK ROOM NIGHT LIGHT SHIELDED FROM HIS EYES BY A NEWSPAPER PROPPED AGAINST A WATER PITCHER
BROUGHT FORTH A LARGE UNFRAMED PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS FATHER UPON WHICH HE GAZED LONG AND PITEOUSLY TILL AT LAST HOT TEARS STOOD IN HIS EYES IT WAS STRANGE HOW THE INCONSEQUENT FACE OF WILBUR SEEMED TO INCREASE IN HIGH SIGNIFICANCE
EUGENE WAS INCREDULOUS EVEN WHEN HIS SECOND GLANCE REVEALED HOW HOT OF EYE WAS THE HAGGARD YOUNG MAN BEFORE HIM I BEG YOUR PARDON I SAID I HEARD YOU SAID GEORGE YOU SAID YOU HAD AN ENGAGEMENT WITH MY MOTHER AND I TOLD YOU NO
PRESENTLY ISABEL'S BUOYANT STEP WAS HEARD DESCENDING THE STAIRS AND HER LOW SWEET WHISTLING RENEWING THE AIR OF LORD BATEMAN SHE CAME INTO THE LIBRARY STILL WHISTLING THOUGHTFULLY A FUR COAT OVER HER ARM READY TO PUT ON
GEORGIE THEN RAPPED FOUR TIMES THE RAPPER WITHIN THE ROOM RAPPED TWICE AND GEORGIE RAPPED SEVEN TIMES THIS ENDED PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES AND A WELL DRESSED BOY OF SIXTEEN OPENED THE DOOR WHEREUPON GEORGIE ENTERED QUICKLY AND THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HIM
AN OLD FASHIONED FOUR STORY BRICK WARREN OF LAWYERS OFFICES INSURANCE AND REALESTATE OFFICES WITH A DRYGOODS STORE OCCUPYING THE GROUND FLOOR GEORGIE TIED HIS LATHERED TROTTER TO A TELEGRAPH POLE AND STOOD FOR A MOMENT LOOKING AT THE BUILDING CRITICALLY
AT ONE END OF THE ROOM THERE WAS A BATTERED SIDEBOARD AND UPON IT WERE SOME EMPTY BEER BOTTLES A TOBACCO CAN ABOUT TWO THIRDS FULL WITH A WEB OF MOLD OVER THE SURFACE OF THE TOBACCO A DUSTY CABINET PHOTOGRAPH NOT INSCRIBED OF MISS LILLIAN RUSSELL SEVERAL WITHERED OLD PICKLES
AND A RIPPLE OF SONG IN THE VOICE OF ISABEL A FRAGMENT FROM THE ROMANTIC BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN LORD BATEMAN WAS A NOBLE LORD A NOBLE LORD OF HIGH DEGREE AND HE SAILED WEST AND HE SAILED EAST FAR COUNTRIES FOR TO SEE
YOU'LL BE AS STRONG AS YOU EVER WERE MAYBE STRONGER SHE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT NOT LOOKING AT HIM THEN ADDED CHEERFULLY SO THAT YOU CAN FLY AROUND AND FIND SOMETHING REALLY GOOD TO GET INTO SOMETHING IMPORTANT BETWEEN THEM CAME NEAR THE SURFACE HERE
AND GEORGE HAVING WATCHED ITS IMPETUOUS DISAPPEARANCE FROM HIS FIELD OF VISION CEASED TO HAUNT THE WINDOW HE WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND SEATING HIMSELF BESIDE THE TABLE WHEREON HE HAD PLACED THE PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS FATHER PICKED UP A BOOK AND PRETENDED TO BE ENGAGED IN READING IT
AND HER SPRIGHTLY DISREGARD OF HIS PROTESTS ADDED SOMETHING TO HIS HATRED OF HER EVERY EVENING HE TOLD HER THAT ANYBODY WITH ORDINARY GUMPTION OUGHT TO REALIZE THAT NIGHT AIR WAS BAD FOR THE HUMAN FRAME THE HUMAN FRAME WON'T STAND EVERYTHING MISS PERRY
MARY RETURNED TWAS A PEDLAR MA'AM ANOTHER ONE ISABEL SAID SURPRISED I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS A PEDLAR WHEN THE BELL RANG A LITTLE WHILE AGO MISTER GEORGE SAID IT WAS MA'AM HE WENT TO THE DOOR MARY INFORMED HER DISAPPEARING
HIS CAP AND GLOVES WERE OF GRAY SUEDE
WHEN I WENT AWAY I SAID I DIDN'T CARE IF YOU HAD A VICE PRESIDENT OR SOMETHING WHILE I WAS GONE BUT HERE I HARDLY TURNED MY BACK AND YOU HAD TO GO AND ELECT FRED KINNEY PRESIDENT WELL IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT YOU CAN HAVE IT
DURING THIS BELATED INTERVIEW BETWEEN FATHER AND SON AND HOW IT SEEMED TO TAKE ON A REPROACHFUL NOBILITY AND YET UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE NATURAL THAN THAT GEORGE HAVING PAID BUT THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO HIS FATHER IN LIFE
THE DOG CART TURNED THE NEXT CORNER CAUSING INDIGNATION THERE LIKEWISE
OVER THE BOOKSHELVES THERE WAS ANOTHER LITHOGRAPH PURPORTING TO REPRESENT MISTER JOHN L SULLIVAN IN A BOXING COSTUME AND BESIDE IT A HALFTONE REPRODUCTION OF A READING FROM HORNER
IN HIS YOUTH ADAMS MIGHT HAVE BEEN LESS RESENTFUL OF SOUNDS SUCH AS THESE WHEN THEY INTERFERED WITH HIS NIGHT'S SLEEP EVEN DURING AN ILLNESS HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN SOME PRIDE IN THEM AS PROOF OF HIS CITIZENSHIP IN A LIVE TOWN
LISTEN I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH IT SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS THOUGHT THAT LONG AS YOU WEREN'T IN TOWN OR ANYTHING AND FRED GAVE THE SIDEBOARD WHY MISTER KINNEY PRESIDING HELD IN HIS HAND IN LIEU OF A GAVEL AND CONSIDERED MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE A CIVIL WAR RELIC KNOWN AS A HORSE PISTOL
SHE WORE A LANK COTTON WRAPPER AND A CRESCENT OF GRAY HAIR ESCAPED TO ONE TEMPLE FROM BENEATH THE HANDKERCHIEF SHE HAD WORN UPON HER HEAD FOR THE NIGHT AND STILL RETAINED BUT SHE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE HER EXPRESSION CHEERING
BUT WAS TOO POWERFUL A GROWING THING EVER TO LIE ALTOGETHER STILL EVEN WHILE IT STROVE TO SLEEP IT MUTTERED WITH DIGESTIONS OF THE DAY BEFORE AND THESE ALREADY MERGED WITH RUMBLINGS OF THE MORROW
THE YEARNERS WERE STILL YEARNING WHEN GEORGIE AT SIXTEEN WAS SENT AWAY TO A GREAT PREP SCHOOL NOW THEY SAID BRIGHTLY HE'LL GET IT HE'LL FIND HIMSELF AMONG BOYS JUST AS IMPORTANT IN THEIR HOME TOWNS AS HE IS AND THEY'LL KNOCK THE STUFFING OUT OF HIM WHEN HE PUTS ON HIS AIRS WITH THEM
BUT AT TWELVE GEORGIE WAS SENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN THE TOWN AND THERE CAME FROM THIS SMALL AND DEPENDENT INSTITUTION NO REPORT OR EVEN RUMOUR OF GEORGIE'S GETTING ANYTHING THAT HE WAS THOUGHT TO DESERVE THEREFORE THE YEARNING STILL PERSISTED
ALL EXCEPT GETTING YOUR STRENGTH BACK OF COURSE AND THAT ISN'T GOING TO TAKE LONG YOU'LL BE RIGHT ON YOUR FEET IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS FROM NOW OH I WILL OF COURSE YOU WILL SHE LAUGHED BRISKLY AND GOING TO THE TABLE IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM MOVED HIS GLASS OF MEDICINE AN INCH OR TWO
ALICE ADAMS BY BOOTH TARKINGTON CHAPTER ONE THE PATIENT AN OLD FASHIONED MAN THOUGHT THE NURSE MADE A MISTAKE IN KEEPING BOTH OF THE WINDOWS OPEN

GEORGE WENT SLOWLY TO THE FRONT DOOR AND HALTED REGARDING THE MISTY SILHOUETTE OF THE CALLER UPON THE ORNAMENTAL FROSTED GLASS AFTER A MINUTE OF WAITING THIS SILHOUETTE CHANGED OUTLINE SO THAT AN ARM COULD BE DISTINGUISHED
HE OCCUPIED AN ANCIENT AND VAST APARTMENT ON THE FIRST FLOOR BETWEEN STREET AND GARDENS
HE IS THE DISGRACE OF MY FAMILY SAID THE OLD BOURGEOIS HE TOOK AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF SNUFF AND HAD A PARTICULARLY GRACEFUL MANNER OF PLUCKING AT HIS LACE RUFFLE WITH THE BACK OF ONE HAND HE BELIEVED VERY LITTLE IN GOD
LEANING ON EACH OTHER FOR SUPPORT THERE WAS ALSO IN THIS HOUSE BETWEEN THIS ELDERLY SPINSTER AND THIS OLD MAN A CHILD A LITTLE BOY WHO WAS ALWAYS TREMBLING AND MUTE IN THE
SHE KEPT HOUSE FOR HER FATHER
LET HIM BE TAKEN CARE OF IT IS NOT HIS FAULT THIS MANNER OF PROCEDURE WAS GOOD TEMPERED THE WOMAN WHOSE NAME WAS MAGNON SENT HIM ANOTHER PARCEL IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR IT WAS A BOY AGAIN
COASTING CAREFULLY ROUND THE OLD IRON AND THE BROKEN TILES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE IN HIS PATH
WHICH IS AN IMMENSE ADVANTAGE ISN'T IT SHE SLIPPED A FLOWER INTO HIS HAND FROWNED HIM INTO OBEDIENCE
AFTER HIS OWN FASHION INTO HIS LITTLE CHIMNEY CORNER SATIRES NATURE HE SAID IN ORDER THAT CIVILIZATION MAY HAVE A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING GIVES IT EVEN SPECIMENS OF ITS AMUSING BARBARISM EUROPE

PRUDERY IS A DEMI VIRTUE AND A DEMI VICE TO PRUDERY SHE ADDED BIGOTRY A WELL ASSORTED LINING SHE BELONGED TO THE SOCIETY OF THE VIRGIN
HE DESIRED THAT ALL WHICH CONCERNED HIM SHOULD BE DONE IN A GRAND MANNER EVEN HIS ROGUERIES ONE DAY HAVING BEEN CHEATED BY A BUSINESS MAN IN A MATTER OF INHERITANCE IN A GROSS AND APPARENT MANNER
BUT I AM TOO POOR HE SAID IF I WERE NOT RUINED HEEE ALL HE HAD LEFT IN FACT WAS AN INCOME OF ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS HIS DREAM WAS TO COME INTO AN INHERITANCE
AND ONE OF THE MOST OBTUSE MINDS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE A CHARACTERISTIC DETAIL OUTSIDE OF HER IMMEDIATE FAMILY NO ONE HAD EVER KNOWN HER FIRST NAME SHE WAS CALLED MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND
AND BEAUVAIS TAPESTRIES REPRESENTING PASTORAL SCENES THE SUBJECTS OF THE CEILINGS AND THE PANELS WERE REPEATED IN MINIATURE ON THE ARM CHAIRS HE ENVELOPED HIS BED IN A VAST NINE LEAVED SCREEN OF COROMANDEL LACQUER

THAT WOULD BE A FARCE WELL THEY ARE SO STUPID THAT IT WOULD PASS HE MERRILY CALLED EVERYTHING BY ITS NAME WHETHER DECENT OR INDECENT AND DID NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF IN THE LEAST BEFORE LADIES HE UTTERED COARSE SPEECHES
BUT HE NEVER GAVE THEM ANYTHING EXCEPT BAD OR DEMONETIZED SOUS THEREBY DISCOVERING A MEANS OF GOING TO HELL BY WAY OF PARADISE
I WAS DRESSED LIKE A TURK OF THE LEVANT LEVANTIN SAID HE

FRIVOLOUS AND GREAT IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN AND DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THE RESTORATION
AND NEVER ASCENDED SUFFICIENTLY HIGH SHE MULTIPLIED CLASPS AND PINS WHERE NO ONE WOULD HAVE DREAMED OF LOOKING THE PECULIARITY OF PRUDERY IS TO PLACE ALL THE MORE SENTINELS IN PROPORTION AS THE FORTRESS IS THE LESS MENACED
HIS WATERY EYES SETTLED STEADILY FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE VIEW OF THE STREET BEFORE HIM THE NEXT INSTANT HE STARTED HIS BREATH QUICKENED HE LEANED TREMBLING AND FLUSHING
FAINTLY WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN THE NECESSARY WORDS MY HEART BEATS SO YOU'LL KILL ME YOU POOR OLD DEAR SHE WHISPERED BACK WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER MANNER WITH AN EASY SATIRICAL TENDERNESS
WHICH THE OLD GENTLEMAN ASCENDED AND DESCENDED WITH GREAT AGILITY IN ADDITION TO A LIBRARY ADJOINING HIS CHAMBER HE HAD A BOUDOIR OF WHICH HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL A GALLANT AND ELEGANT RETREAT
ADMIRED HIS OWN DISCERNMENT IN ALL THINGS AND DECLARED THAT HE WAS EXTREMELY SAGACIOUS HERE IS ONE OF HIS SAYINGS I HAVE IN TRUTH SOME PENETRATION
HE WAS OVER NINETY YEARS OF AGE HIS WALK WAS ERECT HE TALKED LOUDLY SAW CLEARLY DRANK NEAT
THERE'S A MAN BEHIND ONE OF THE HOUSES WE MUST TALK OUT LOUD OF INDIFFERENT THINGS AND LOOK AS IF WE HAD MET BY ACCIDENT ASK ME WHAT I AM DOING OUT LOUD DIRECTLY YOU SHALL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN IF YOU DON'T

THE YOUNGEST HAD A CHARMING SOUL WHICH TURNED TOWARDS ALL THAT BELONGS TO THE LIGHT WAS OCCUPIED WITH FLOWERS WITH VERSES WITH MUSIC WHICH FLUTTERED AWAY INTO GLORIOUS SPACE
DESTINED FOR THE KNACKER DOZED FORLORN IN THE FIELD OF HIS IMPRISONMENT THE CATS WAITED STEALTHILY IN CORNERS FOR THE COMING NIGHT BUT ONE LIVING FIGURE APPEARED IN THE LONELY SUBURB THE FIGURE OF MISTER BASHWOOD
HE NEVER HAGGLED OVER HIS ALMS GIVING BUT GAVE GLADLY AND NOBLY HE WAS KINDLY ABRUPT CHARITABLE AND IF HE HAD BEEN RICH HIS TURN OF MIND WOULD HAVE BEEN MAGNIFICENT
IN THE VOICE INTENDED TO REACH THE SPY'S EARS
THE PRINCIPAL ONE AND THAT WHICH WAS INVARIABLE WAS TO KEEP HIS DOOR ABSOLUTELY CLOSED DURING THE DAY AND NEVER TO RECEIVE ANY ONE WHATEVER EXCEPT IN THE EVENING HE DINED AT FIVE O'CLOCK
AND HE HAD BEEN CROWNED BY THE HAND OF THE DUC DE NIVERNAIS
PERFECTLY CURLED THAT DROPPED OVER HER LEFT SHOULDER HER GLOVES FITTING HER LIKE A SECOND SKIN
CHAPTER FIVE BASQUE AND NICOLETTE HE HAD THEORIES HERE IS ONE OF THEM WHEN A MAN IS PASSIONATELY FOND OF WOMEN
ONE HAND LIFTED HER DRESS DAINTILY ABOVE THE IMPURITIES OF THE ROAD THE OTHER HELD A LITTLE NOSEGAY OF THE COMMONEST GARDEN FLOWERS NOISELESSLY AND SMOOTHLY SHE CAME ON
ENTHUSIASTIC ETHEREAL AND WAS WEDDED FROM HER VERY YOUTH IN IDEAL TO A VAGUE AND HEROIC FIGURE
HIS PAST EXISTENCE HAD DISCIPLINED HIM TO BEAR DISASTER AND INSULT AS FEW HAPPIER MEN COULD HAVE BORNE THEM
HE OWNED THE HOUSE THIS HOUSE HAS SINCE BEEN DEMOLISHED AND REBUILT AND THE NUMBER HAS PROBABLY BEEN CHANGED IN THOSE REVOLUTIONS OF NUMERATION WHICH THE STREETS OF PARIS UNDERGO
AND IF I DON'T HEAR OF IT I'LL FRIGHTEN YOU TO DEATH IF I DO HEAR OF IT I'LL KISS YOU HUSH

IN SPITE OF THIS FAVORED LANCER THE LABEL PRUDE UNDER WHICH WE HAVE CLASSED HER SUITED HER TO ABSOLUTE PERFECTION
LOOK OUT FOR THEM TO MORROW AND NEXT DAY AND NEXT DAY THEY ARE CERTAIN TO MEET AND MAKE IT UP AGAIN AND I MUST
THIS ROYAL RENOWN SOMETIMES DREW DOWN UPON HIM SINGULAR WINDFALLS ONE DAY THERE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM IN A BASKET AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A BASKET OF OYSTERS A STOUT NEWLY BORN BOY WHO WAS YELLING LIKE THE DEUCE
AND THE CATS EVERYWHERE ON THE TILES THE SUN HAD SET AND THE SUMMER TWILIGHT WAS DARKENING THE FRETFUL CHILDREN WERE CRYING IN THEIR CRADLES THE HORSE
HE SENT THE TWO BRATS BACK TO THEIR MOTHER PROMISING TO PAY EIGHTY FRANCS A MONTH FOR THEIR MAINTENANCE ON THE CONDITION THAT THE SAID MOTHER WOULD NOT DO SO ANY MORE HE ADDED I INSIST UPON IT THAT THE MOTHER SHALL TREAT THEM WELL
TOWARD ONE OF THE UNFINISHED STREETS OF THE SUBURB HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HAD BEEN APPARENTLY MADE THE OBJECT OF SOME SPECIAL ATTENTION HIS FALSE TEETH WERE BRILLIANTLY WHITE HIS WIG WAS CAREFULLY BRUSHED
HE BESTOWED ON THE MEN THE NAME OF THEIR PROVINCE NIMOIS COMTOIS
HAS EXHAUSTED THE ENJOYMENT OF FRIGHTENING A MOUSE LEFT ALONE MISTER BASHWOOD TURNED TO THE LOW COTTAGE WALL NEAR WHICH HE HAD BEEN STANDING AND RESTING HIMSELF ON IT WEARILY LOOKED AT THE FLOWER IN HIS HAND
LAND HOLDERS SET UP POLES ON LOST PATCHES OF GROUND AND PLAINTIVELY ADVERTISING THAT THEY WERE TO LET FOR BUILDING RAISED SICKLY LITTLE CROPS MEANWHILE
PICTURESQUE AND DELIGHTFUL VARIETY OF BROKEN GROUND THE RANK FASHION AND BEAUTY OF THE TOWN MAKE THIS PLACE THEIR EVENING PROMENADE AND WHEN A STRANGER GOES OUT FOR A DRIVE IF HE LEAVES IT TO THE COACHMAN
AT THE SAME MOMENT LIFTED HER DRESS AGAIN ABOVE THE IMPURITIES OF THE ROAD AND WENT ON HER WAY WITH A DAINTY AND INDOLENT DELIBERATION
HE WAS OF AN AMOROUS DISPOSITION BUT DECLARED THAT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS HE HAD WHOLLY AND DECIDEDLY RENOUNCED WOMEN HE COULD NO LONGER PLEASE HE SAID HE DID NOT ADD I AM TOO OLD
WITH MILLIONS OF DETAILS IN A CONFUSED AND HAP HAZARD MANNER
FASHIONABLE PEOPLE ONLY LIGHT UP THEIR MINDS WHEN THE ZENITH LIGHTS UP ITS STARS AND HE BARRICADED HIMSELF AGAINST EVERY ONE EVEN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF THIS WAS THE ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE OF HIS DAY
HE FLEW INTO A PASSION AT EVERYTHING GENERALLY QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL REASON WHEN CONTRADICTED HE RAISED HIS CANE HE BEAT PEOPLE AS HE HAD DONE IN THE GREAT CENTURY HE HAD A DAUGHTER OVER FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND UNMARRIED
YOUR GOOD WORD WILL OBLIGE ME HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE GROUNDS TO DAY SHE WENT ON DROPPING HER VOICE AGAIN IN A WHISPER HAS MISTER ARMADALE BEEN NEAR THE COTTAGE HAS MISS MILROY BEEN OUT OF THE GARDEN NO ARE YOU SURE
AS WE HAVE SEEN THAT MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU HAD HIS SISTER WITH HIM THESE HOUSEHOLDS COMPRISED OF AN OLD MAN AND AN OLD SPINSTER ARE NOT RARE AND ALWAYS HAVE THE TOUCHING ASPECT OF TWO WEAKNESSES
BEYOND THE AGNUS DEI AND AVE MARIA MADEMOISELLE VAUBOIS HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING EXCEPT OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MAKING PRESERVES MADEMOISELLE VAUBOIS PERFECT IN HER STYLE WAS THE
IN EVERY CASUAL MOVEMENT THAT ESCAPED HER EXPRESSING THAT SUBTLE MIXTURE OF THE VOLUPTUOUS AND THE MODEST WHICH OF THE MANY ATTRACTIVE EXTREMES THAT MEET IN WOMEN
AND THE MOST CHARMING OF LOVERS IN EXISTENCE HE WAS A CONNOISSEUR OF PAINTING HE HAD IN HIS CHAMBER A MARVELLOUS PORTRAIT OF NO ONE KNOWS WHOM PAINTED BY JORDAENS EXECUTED WITH GREAT DASHES OF THE BRUSH
IF THERE WAS ANY INTENTION IN THORPE AMBROSE OF SENDING A WORN OUT HORSE TO THE KNACKER'S
NOR THE RETURN OF THE BOURBONS NOR ANYTHING ELSE HAD BEEN ABLE TO EFFACE THE MEMORY OF THIS CROWNING THE DUC DE NEVERS WAS IN HIS EYES THE GREAT FIGURE OF THE CENTURY
UNDERTAKES THE EDUCATION OF HALF SHARE TENANTS AND THE TRAINING OF FARMERS CONVOKES LAWYERS PRESIDES OVER NOTARIES HARANGUES SCRIVENERS VISITS LIMBS OF THE LAW FOLLOWS LAWSUITS DRAWS UP LEASES DICTATES CONTRACTS
ONE DAY A MAN HAD BEHELD HER GARTER AGE HAD ONLY SERVED TO ACCENTUATE THIS PITILESS MODESTY
LONG FULL CURTAINS HUNG FROM THE WINDOWS AND FORMED GREAT BROKEN FOLDS THAT WERE VERY MAGNIFICENT THE GARDEN SITUATED IMMEDIATELY UNDER HIS WINDOWS WAS ATTACHED TO THAT ONE OF THEM WHICH FORMED THE ANGLE
THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO ROB A MAN OF MY STANDING I AM ROBBED AS THOUGH IN A FOREST BUT BADLY ROBBED
HUMANN CASIMIR PERIER THERE'S A MINISTER FOR YOU
AND FOR INSTANCE BECOME NATIONAL PROPERTY HE HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE AVATARS OF CONSOLIDATED THREE PER CENTS AND HE HAD NO GREAT FAITH IN THE GREAT BOOK OF THE PUBLIC DEBT
THIS BROTHER OF WHOM BUT LITTLE MEMORY REMAINS WAS A PEACEABLE MISER WHO BEING A PRIEST THOUGHT HIMSELF BOUND TO BESTOW ALMS ON THE POOR WHOM HE MET
WHOM HE CHASTISED SEVERELY WITH HIS TONGUE WHEN IN A RAGE AND WHOM HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO WHIP SHE SEEMED TO HIM TO BE EIGHT YEARS OLD HE BOXED HIS SERVANTS EARS SOUNDLY AND SAID AH CAROGNE

FOUND HIMSELF A WIDOWER THERE REMAINED TO HIM JUST SUFFICIENT TO LIVE ON BY SINKING NEARLY THE WHOLE OF IT IN AN ANNUITY OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS THREE QUARTERS OF WHICH WOULD EXPIRE WITH HIM
ERMINE OF STUPIDITY WITHOUT A SINGLE SPOT OF INTELLIGENCE LET US SAY IT PLAINLY MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND HAD GAINED RATHER THAN LOST AS SHE GREW OLDER THIS IS THE CASE WITH PASSIVE NATURES
INSTANTLY LEAVE OFF TREMBLING AND DO WHAT I TELL YOU SHE SPOKE WITH A MERCILESS TYRANNY OF EYE AND VOICE WITH A MERCILESS USE OF HER POWER OVER THE FEEBLE CREATURE WHOM SHE ADDRESSED
THEY HAD COME INTO THE WORLD TEN YEARS APART IN THEIR YOUTH THEY HAD BORNE VERY LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO EACH OTHER EITHER IN CHARACTER OR COUNTENANCE AND HAD ALSO BEEN AS LITTLE LIKE SISTERS TO EACH OTHER AS POSSIBLE

HE GAZED AT THE BRAT WITH THE AMIABLE SMILE OF A GOOD MAN WHO IS FLATTERED BY THE CALUMNY AND SAID IN AN ASIDE WELL WHAT NOW WHAT'S THE MATTER YOU ARE FINELY TAKEN ABACK AND REALLY YOU ARE EXCESSIVELY IGNORANT
REMAINED FOR HOURS IN CONTEMPLATION BEFORE A ROCOCO JESUIT ALTAR IN A CHAPEL WHICH WAS INACCESSIBLE TO THE RANK AND FILE OF THE FAITHFUL AND THERE ALLOWED HER SOUL TO SOAR AMONG LITTLE CLOUDS OF MARBLE
SHE WAS MELANCHOLY WITH AN OBSCURE SADNESS OF WHICH SHE DID NOT HERSELF KNOW THE SECRET THERE BREATHED FROM HER WHOLE PERSON THE STUPOR OF A LIFE THAT WAS FINISHED AND WHICH HAD NEVER HAD A BEGINNING

HE HAS BEEN DUCKED GRINNED THE YELLOWS IN ANSWER THEY HAVE BEEN AND DUCKED HIM IN THE RUSH POOL ON MISTER JUSTICE HARE'S LAND THE SOAKED AND MISERABLE MAN INCREASED HIS SPEED AS MUCH AS HIS COLD AND TREMBLING LEGS WOULD ALLOW HIM

I AM AS SURE THAT SHE IS DEAD AS THAT WE ARE LIVING DECISIVELY REPLIED THE EARL AND HE SPOKE BUT ACCORDING TO HIS BELIEF WHEREFORE SHOULD YOU BE INQUIRING THIS A THOUGHT CAME OVER ME ONLY TO DAY TO WONDER WHETHER SHE WAS REALLY DEAD
DROPPING THE POINT OF THE CONTEST AS TO THE PIPES YOU ARE VERY CLEVER ARCHIE BUT YOU CAN'T DO ME I ASKED BARBARA WHAT SHE CAME HERE FOR BUSINESS FOR MAMMA TOUCHING MONEY MATTERS WAS HER REPLY I ASK YOU
YES SIR HE CROSSED THE HALL ON HIS ENTRANCE TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM SHE TORE UPSTAIRS TO HER CHAMBER AND SANK DOWN IN AN AGONY OF TEARS AND DESPAIR OH TO LOVE HIM AS SHE DID NOW TO YEARN AFTER HIS AFFECTION WITH THIS PASSIONATE JEALOUS LONGING
WHO OR WHAT WAS THAT OBJECT IN ADVANCE OF IT SUPPORTED BETWEEN DRAKE AND THE LAWYER AND LOOKING LIKE A DROWNED RAT HAIR HANGING LEGS TOTTERING CHEEKS SHAKING AND CLOTHES IN TATTERS

MISTER CARLYLE'S LIP CURLED HE CONTINUED HIS WAY AND DREW THE PEER WITH HIM WHAT THE DEUCE IS A GATE NOW CALLED OUT THE FOLLOWERS OF MISTER CARLYLE THAT'S LEVISON HAS HE BEEN IN A RAILWAY SMASH AND GOT DRENCHED BY THE ENGINE
IN THE CENTRE OF WEST LYNNE STOOD TWO HOUSES ADJOINING EACH OTHER ONE LARGE THE OTHER MUCH SMALLER THE LARGE ONE WAS THE CARLYLE RESIDENCE AND THE SMALL ONE WAS DEVOTED TO THE CARLYLE OFFICES THE NAME OF CARLYLE BORE A LOFTY STANDING IN THE COUNTY
OR WHETHER THEIR OWN FEELINGS ALONE SPURRED THEM ON WAS BEST KNOWN TO THE MEN THEMSELVES CERTAIN IT IS THAT THE OMINOUS SOUND OF DUCK HIM WAS BREATHED FORTH BY A VOICE AND IT WAS CAUGHT UP AND ECHOED AROUND DUCK HIM
WHEN THE DOOR TIMIDLY OPENED AND THE PRETTY FACE OF BARBARA HARE APPEARED AT IT ROSY WITH BLUSHES CAN I SEE MISTER CARLYLE MISTER DILL ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND SHOOK HANDS WITH HER SHE DREW HIM INTO THE PASSAGE AND HE CLOSED THE DOOR PERHAPS HE FELT SURPRISED
SHE POINTED OUT WHAT SHE WANTED DONE TO THE OLD GLASSES AND SAID SHE WOULD BUY A PAIR OF NEW ONES TO WEAR WHILE THE JOB WAS ABOUT THE MAN HAD NO BLUE ONES NO GREEN PLENTY OF WHITE ONE UGLY OLD PAIR OF GREEN THINGS HE HAD
MISS CARLYLE'S ROOMS A FINE ROW WE HAVE HAD IN THE TOWN JOYCE THIS AFTERNOON I HAVE HEARD OF IT MA'AM SERVED HIM RIGHT IF THEY HAD LET HIM DROWN BILL WHITE SQUIRE PINNER'S PLOWMAN CALLED IN HERE AND TOLD US THE NEWS HE'D HAVE BURST WITH IT IF HE HADN'T I EXPECT

WITH AN IRON HAND SHE LIKED TO RULE HIM NOW IN GREAT THINGS AS IN SMALL JUST AS SHE HAD DONE IN THE DAYS OF HIS BABYHOOD AND ARCHIBALD GENERALLY SUBMITTED FOR THE FORCE OF HABIT IS STRONG SHE WAS A WOMAN OF STRONG SENSE
NOW MISS CORNY IN SO SPEAKING HAD CERTAINLY NO THOUGHT OF PRESENT AND IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT FOR THE GENTLEMAN BUT IT APPEARED THAT THE MOB AROUND HAD THE MOTION WAS COMMENTED BY THOSE STOUT SHOULDERED LABORERS
THEY LOOK AS STRONG AS EYES CAN LOOK BUT WHY WEAR COLORED GLASSES WHITE ONES WOULD ANSWER EVERY PURPOSE I SHOULD SUPPOSE
RICHARD ALSO WISHES FOR AN INTERVIEW IT IS ONLY NATURAL MISSUS HARE MUST BE THANKFUL TO HEAR SO FAR THAT HE IS SAFE I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT RETURNED BARBARA THE CHANGE IS AKIN TO MAGIC SHE SAYS IT HAS PUT LIFE INTO HER ANEW AND NOW FOR THE LAST THING
AND TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOR EVER AND EVER THAT SHE WAS WORSE TO HIM THAN NOTHING
THEY HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A PLAY ACTED FOR THEM BEFORE OUT OF THE PEA SOUP BEFORE HE WAS QUITE DEAD QUITE SENSELESS OF ALL DROWNED RATS HE LOOKED THE WORST AS HE STOOD THERE WITH HIS WHITE RUEFUL FACE
YOU MAY WONDER THAT THE SUBMERGED GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS ON HIS WAY TO HIS QUARTERS THE RAVEN INN FOR HE HAD BEEN EJECTED FROM THE BUCK'S HEAD BUT HE COULD NOT HELP HIMSELF AS HE WAS DRIPPING AND SWEARING ON THE BRINK OF THE POND
SHE SAILED ON WITH HER HEAD UP THOUGH IT WAS TURNED OCCASIONALLY TO LOOK AT THE FACE OF MADAME VINE AT THE DEEP DISTRESSING BLUSH WHICH THIS GAZE CALLED INTO HER CHEEKS IT'S VERY ODD THOUGHT MISS CORNY THE LIKENESS ESPECIALLY IN THE EYES IS

SHE TURNED HERSELF ROUND FROM THE LOOKING GLASS AND GAZED FULL IN JOYCE'S FACE WAITING FOR THE ANSWER JOYCE LOWERED HER VOICE AS SHE GAVE IT
JOYCE WAS SILENT TO CONTRADICT MISS CORNY BROUGHT TRIUMPH TO NOBODY AND SHE WAS CONSCIOUS IN HER INNERMOST HEART THAT AFY MERITED A LITTLE WHOLESOME CORRECTION NOT PERHAPS TO THE EXTENT OF A DUCKING
MISTER CARLYLE RETURNED TO HIS ROOM DELIBERATED A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN RANG HIS BELL A CLERK ANSWERED IT GO TO THE BUCK'S HEAD IF MISTER HARE AND THE OTHER MAGISTRATES ARE THERE ASK THEM TO STEP OVER TO ME THE YOUNG MAN DID AS HE WAS BID

MISS CARLYLE STOOD HER GROUND MAJESTICALLY AND LOOKED ON WITH A GRIM COUNTENANCE HAD SHE INTERFERED FOR HIS PROTECTION SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HEARD AND IF SHE COULD HAVE BEEN THERE'S NO KNOWING WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE DONE IT ON TO THE BRINK OF THE POND

DO YOU ADMIT INTRUDERS HERE MADAME VINE CRIED HE WITH HIS SWEET SMILE AND ATTRACTIVE MANNER SHE AROSE HER FACE BURNING HER HEART THROBBING KEEP YOUR SEAT PRAY I HAVE BUT A MOMENT TO STAY SAID MISTER CARLYLE
WHEN DISSENTING FROM A PROBLEM SHE WAS SURE THERE WAS SOME MYSTERY ASTIR SHE TURNED AND WALKED DOWN THE STREET WITH BARBARA
THE DRIVE I THINK WILL DO HIM GOOD REPLIED MISTER CARLYLE AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ACCOMPANY HIM IF YOU DO NOT MIND THE TROUBLE YOU CAN HAVE THE PONY CARRIAGE
MISS CORNY FLEW TO THE WINDOW LADY ISABEL IN HER WAKE TWO CROWDS IT MAY ALMOST BE SAID FOR FROM THE OPPOSITE WAY THE SCARLET AND PURPLE PARTY AS MISTER CARLYLE'S WAS CALLED IN ALLUSION TO HIS COLORS CAME IN VIEW
TO HEAR YOUR OPINION ABOUT THE SCRAPE THE BENCH HAVE GOT INTO IS YOURS NOW IT'S NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER AND I TELL YOU ARCHIBALD I'LL HEAR WHAT IT IS I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU AND BARBARA DO WITH A SECRET BETWEEN YOU MISTER CARLYLE KNEW HER AND HER RESOLUTE EXPRESSION WELL
WAS THE PROMISE HELD OUT IN REPLY TO THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND THE LAWYER WHO WAS SHORT AND FAT AND COULD NOT HAVE KNOCKED A MAN DOWN HAD IT BEEN TO SAVE HIS LIFE BACKED OUT OF THE MELEE AND CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH ISSUING FORTH CONFUSED THREATENINGS OF THE TERRORS OF THE LAW
WONDERING HOW HE SHOULD GET TO THE RAVEN AN EMPTY FLY DROVE PAST AND MISTER DRAKE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED IT BUT WHEN THE DRIVER SAW THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO CONVEY NOT ONLY A PASSENGER BUT A TOLERABLE QUANTITY OF WATER AS WELL AND THAT THE PASSENGER MOREOVER WAS SIR FRANCIS LEVISON
BEFORE THE CLERKS OR HER FATHER MAMMA WANTED MISTER CARLYLE'S OPINION UPON A LITTLE PRIVATE BUSINESS AND NOT FEELING WELL ENOUGH TO COME HERSELF SHE SENT ME

NOT TO SPEAK OF THE TAGRAG'S HELP WHO WENT IN WITH CUFFS AND KICKS AND POKES AND TAUNTS AND CHEERS AND A DEMONIAC DANCE THEY DRAGGED HIM THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE A GAP THAT NO BABY COULD HAVE GOT THROUGH IN A COOL MOMENT BUT MOST OF US KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COOLNESS AND EXCITEMENT
AFY SAW IT IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME MENTIONING HER NAME TO YOU MA'AM
FOR HIS SPECTACLES MIGHT BE DISCERNED AT IT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WAS AGREEABLE THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD A DESK ALSO IN THEIR OFFICE AND THERE HE FREQUENTLY SAT HE WAS SITTING THERE IN STATE THIS SAME MORNING KEEPING A SHARP LOOKOUT AROUND HIM
MISS CARLYLE LAID HER HAND UPON THE SHRINKING ARM OF HER PALE COMPANION YOU SEE HIM MY BROTHER ARCHIBALD I SEE HIM FALTERED LADY ISABEL AND YOU SEE HIM THAT PITIFUL OUTCAST WHO IS TOO CONTEMPTIBLE TO LIVE
I SHOULD HAVE PREMISED THAT I HAVE NOT YET TOLD MAMMA IT IS RICHARD HIMSELF WHO IS HERE BUT THAT HE HAS SENT A MESSENGER TO BEG FOR THIS MONEY WOULD IT BE ADVISABLE TO ACQUAINT HER WHY SHOULD YOU NOT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO DO SO THEN I WILL
A PAUSE MISS CARLYLE WAS RUMINATING BUT SHE RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AS IF DIFFICULT TO BE CONVINCED YOU DEEM THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF AN ERROR YOU ARE SURE THAT SHE IS DEAD
STUCK HIS PENDENT EYE GLASSES ASTRIDE ON THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE SIR FRANCIS LEVISON COULD IT BE YES IT ACTUALLY WAS WHAT ON EARTH HAD PUT HIM INTO THAT STATE
THE FIRST MISSUS CARLYLE HAVING BEEN MISTER DAVIDSON'S SISTER SHE HAD DIED AND LEFT ONE CHILD THE SECOND MISSUS CARLYLE DIED WHEN HER SON WAS BORN ARCHIBALD AND HIS HALF SISTER REARED HIM LOVED HIM AND RULED HIM
YOU'D HAVE GONE INTO LAUGHING CONVULSIONS LUCY HAD YOU SEEN THE DROWNED CUR I'D GIVE ALL MY TIN FOR SIX MONTHS TO COME TO HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM AS HE LOOKED THEN LUCY LAUGHED IN GLEE
FRANCIS LEVISON WOULD HAVE STOPPED IN THE POND OF HIS OWN ACCORD HEAD DOWNWARD RATHER THAN FACE THEM MISS CARLYLE WENT THAT DAY TO DINE AT EAST LYNNE
HERE HE SAW CLIENTS WHEN MISTER CARLYLE WAS OUT OR ENGAGED AND HERE HE ISSUED PRIVATE ORDERS A LITTLE WINDOW NOT LARGER THAN A PANE OF GLASS LOOKED OUT FROM THE CLERK'S OFFICE THEY CALLED IT OLD DILL'S PEEP HOLE AND WISHED IT ANYWHERE ELSE
TURN HIMSELF UP AT WEST LYNNE FOR BEARDING MISTER CARLYLE WHAT HAVE HE DONE WITH LADY ISABEL HIM PUT UP FOR OTHERS AT WEST LYNNE WEST LYNNE'S RESPECTABLE IT DON'T WANT HIM IT HAVE GOT A BETTER MAN IT WON'T HAVE A VILLAIN NOW LADS
I WANT YOU TO SEE RICHARD IF POSSIBLE HE IS COMING TO THE SAME PLACE TO NIGHT IF HE CAN TELL HIS OWN TALE TO YOU PERHAPS YOU MAY FIND OUT A WAY BY WHICH HIS INNOCENCE MAY BE MADE MANIFEST YOU ARE SO CLEVER YOU CAN DO ANYTHING MISTER CARLYLE SMILED
IT WAS MISTER DILL A LITTLE MEEK LOOKING MAN WITH A BALD HEAD HE WAS ON THE ROLLS HAD BEEN ADMITTED YEARS AND YEARS AGO BUT HE HAD NEVER SET UP FOR HIMSELF PERHAPS HE DEEMED THE POST OF HEAD MANAGER IN THE OFFICE OF CARLYLE AND DAVIDSON
WITH TORTOISE SHELL RIMS LEFT BY SOME STRANGER AGES AND AGES AGO TO BE MENDED AND NEVER CALLED FOR AGAIN THIS VERY PAIR OF UGLY OLD GREEN THINGS WAS CHOSEN BY LADY ISABEL SHE PUT THEM ON THERE AND THEN
YE WILL WILL YE HISSED THE VOICE OF THE ENGINEER AGAIN
PRESUMABLY FROM THE ENGINE OR BOILER ROOM THROW ASIDE SOMETHING AS HE HURRIED ALONG THE PASSAGEWAY LEADING FROM THE WIRELESS ROOM
HE'S A THIRD CLASS MACHINIST SIR THE ENGINEER REPLIED
REFRESHED BY THEIR SLEEP JERRY AND SLIM AROSE ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON JOE WHO HAD RESTED EASILY THROUGHOUT THE LATER EXCITEMENT OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT WAS STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE INVESTIGATION AND WAS NOT THEN TO BE FOUND
YOU WILL SEEK A SUITABLE LOCATION FROM WHICH TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATIONS YOU WILL DETERMINE WHETHER IT CAN BE DONE BY WIRELESS AS SOON AS YOU CAN DO SO REPORT WHAT PROGRESS YOU HAVE MADE USE EVERY CAUTION FOR YOU WILL BE IN THE COUNTRY OCCUPIED BY THE ENEMY
THE UNCONSCIOUS FORM OF LIEUTENANT MACKINSON TUMBLED OUT UPON THE FLOOR HIS FACE WAS ALMOST BLUE FROM SUFFOCATION THE CAPTAIN SOUNDED THREE SHORT SHARP BLASTS UPON A WHISTLE WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM HIS POCKET AND TWO OILERS CAME RUNNING TO THE SPOT
AND IF WOUNDED MIGHT OTHERWISE STARVE TO DEATH
THE BRIGHTON BOYS AND THEIR FRIEND AND SUPERIOR OFFICER THE LIEUTENANT HAD BEEN IN THEIR APPOINTED PLACES HARDLY MORE THAN AN HOUR WHEN JOE AND JERRY AT THE SAME INSTANT CAUGHT THE SOUNDS OF SOME SORT OF SCUFFLE ON THE DECK ABOVE
ALSO THERE WAS A WIRE COMPANY OF THE SIGNAL CORPS WHICH WAS GOING TO JOIN ANOTHER AMERICAN UNIT FOR THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR HOURS OF THE TRIP THE LADS
HELP US CARRY THIS MAN TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY HE ORDERED HE HAS BEEN OVERCOME
YOU SHOULD LEAVE HERE ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS EVENING IT IS NOW SIX FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THEY HAD EXAMINED THEIR ARMS AND EQUIPPED THEMSELVES WITH A FULL SUPPLY OF SMALL ARMS AMMUNITION PORTABLE WIRELESS INSTRUMENT AND ANTENNAE AND THREE RATIONS EACH OF EATING CHOCOLATE
WHERE IN THAT COUNTRY THEY HAD SEEN BIG CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND
BY THIS TIME THEY WERE WELL WITHIN SOUND OF THE HEAVY GUNS AND THEIR DRIVER TOLD THEM THAT THE ARTILLERY DUEL THEN GOING ON HAD BEEN IN PROGRESS FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS AT LEAST
IT CAME NEARER AND CLEARER UNTIL FINALLY AS IT REACHED A POINT NEAR TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRWAY UNDER WHICH JOE WAS CONCEALED THE LATTER COULD DISCERN THE FOG HORN VOICE OF THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER
AND THRUST THE ENGINEER FROM HIM BEFORE ANYONE COULD INTERFERE HE WAS DASHING DOWN THE DECK TOWARD THE STERN JUST AS HE TOOK A WILD HEADLONG LEAP OVER THE RAIL THE CAPTAIN FIRED WHILE THE CAPTAIN THROUGH A SPEAKING TUBE WAS INSTRUCTING THE MAN IN THE PILOT HOUSE TO SIGNAL BELOW REVERSE ENGINES
IT SIMPLY INDICATED THAT THOSE MANNING THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH ANTI AIRCRAFT GUNS
THERE WERE MUTUAL FEELINGS OF DISAPPOINTMENT BUT NONE OF WEAKENED DETERMINATION WHAT LUCK
HE MADE HIS WHEREABOUTS KNOWN BY TAPPING A MESSAGE ON A STEAM PIPE
THE AMERICANS AND FRENCH HAD RETREATED TO A GENERAL LINE WHICH PERMITTED A QUICK RE MOBILIZATION TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE THERE THEIR FRONT LINE RANKS HELD FIRM WHILE THE NEW FORMATION WAS BEING EFFECTED BEHIND THEM IT WAS ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THIS WAS COMPLETE
AND MADE ME RUN A MILE IN NOTHING FLAT ADDED JERRY AND FOUGHT ME TO A KNOCKOUT FINISH LATER MUSED JOE AND NEARLY SMOTHERED ME TO DEATH SPOKE THE LIEUTENANT AND WAS FINALLY CORRALLED BY AN IRISH ENGINEER SAID SLIM GONE CONCLUDED JERRY
TO WHICH HE IS AN ENEMY AND A TRAITOR BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS THAT KNOCKOUT THAT HE HANDED TO JOE AND THE MIDNIGHT SCARE HE GAVE JERRY AND ME AND FINALLY HIS EFFORT TO KILL LIEUTENANT MACKINSON BY SLOW SUFFOCATION
A CRACKLING MERELY FROM THE PRESSURE WITHIN FOR A MOMENT SLIM THOUGHT AN OVER WROUGHT IMAGINATION WAS PLAYING TRICKS UPON HIM BUT HE ROSE HASTILY AND CROSSED THE SHORT INTERVENING DISTANCE
THE FOLLOWING MORNING ALL OF THOSE WHO HAD ARRIVED ON THE TRANSPORTS WERE ESTABLISHED IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP BUT IT WAS MERELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPECTION OF MEN AND EQUIPMENT AND WAS NOT TO BE FOR LONG
APPEARED EQUALLY ANXIOUS A MAN IS DISCOVERED AT NIGHT IN THE BATTERY ROOM OF THE WIRELESS DEPARTMENT OF THIS SHIP CLEARLY UPON AN UNFRIENDLY MISSION SAID THE CAPTAIN HALF TO HIMSELF AND HALF FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHERS SUMMING UP THE EVIDENCE THUS FAR KNOWN TO THEM
AND SLIM HASTENED AWAY TO RETURN TWO MINUTES LATER WITH ALL THREE TOOLS
OR LIFELESS BEFORE SUPERIOR NUMBERS
YE DIRTY HOUND I'VE A MIND TO BOOT YE INTO THE SEA
IS SHOVED INTO A CLOSET AND ONLY ESCAPES DEATH FROM SUFFOCATION BY MAKING HIMSELF HEARD AS HE TELEGRAPHS FOR HELP OVER A STEAM PIPE IT MUST HAVE BEEN WHILE WE WERE RESCUING THE LIEUTENANT THAT THE SAME MAN AGAIN ENTERS THE WIRELESS ROOM AND LEAVES THERE THIS CHAIN
YES AND I BELIEVE HE'S WORSE THAN THAT THE CAPTAIN ADDED
AND SO EVEN AS TWO MEN CARRIED LIEUTENANT MACKINSON AWAY HE REMAINED STANDING AT SALUTE WAITING FOR THE CAPTAIN TO RECOGNIZE HIM WITH A RETURN OF THE SALUTE AND NOW WHAT ASKED THE CAPTAIN JERRY STEPPED FORWARD WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING HIS EXCITEMENT
HIS THREE ASSISTANTS ON THE TRIP ACROSS WERE THE FIRST ONES NAMED THE OTHER TWO WERE TOM RAWLE A FELLOW PROPORTIONED LIKE THEIR FIRST FRIEND IN THE SERVICE SERGEANT MARTIN AND A WIRY ENERGETIC QUICK SPEAKING YOUTH NAMED FRANK HOSKINS
AND THE HEAVY ROAR OF THE ARTILLERY ALSO WAS PUNCTUATED WITH LONGER PAUSES
OF ITS OWN MOMENTUM IT ROLLED TO WITHIN A TWO MINUTES RUN OF WHERE THE LIEUTENANT AND THE OTHERS HAD BEEN STANDING IN ANOTHER INSTANT IT WAS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF CURIOUS AMERICAN SOLDIERS
WHAT DID YOU FALL OVER THE LIEUTENANT FINALLY ASKED OF SLIM IN A SCARCELY AUDIBLE TONE I JUST FOUND IT REPLIED SLIM
BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM WITHIN
STILL GOING AT MAXIMUM SPEED AND NOW ON A STRAIGHT LINE TOWARD THE AMERICAN SIDE WITHOUT SEEKING A FURTHER HEIGHT THE TAUBE SEVERAL TIMES WAVERED AND A MOMENT LATER ALMOST TURNED OVER BUT THE PILOT RIGHTED HER
AND AFTER DESCENDING A LITTLE BY PERMITTING SOME OF THE GAS TO ESCAPE WE JUMPED OVER THE SIDE OF THE BASKET AND CAME DOWN ON OUR PARACHUTES
SO YOU CAN JUDGE PRETTY WELL FOR YOURSELF GUESS HE HAD A PRETTY GOOD BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE WHOLE THING SAID JOE AS THEY PASSED ON TO MEET AGAIN BEFORE MESS EXCEPT FOR SPASMODIC OUTBURSTS HERE AND THERE THE TRENCH DUEL HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY SUBSIDED
TO FIND SOMEONE STANDING DIRECTLY OVER HIM LOUDLY AND INSISTENTLY CALLING HIS NAME
AND THAT WAS ALL THAT LIEUTENANT MACKINSON COULD TELL THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER REMAINED WHAT HE HAD BEEN FROM THE FIRST A DESPERATE AND DANGEROUS AND UNKNOWN SPY
WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON THE MESSAGE BEGAN TO COME BACK
AND EVEN THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A WELL DESIGNED HOAX
THEN WE ALL DROPPED ON OUR STOMACHS AND WRIGGLED OUR WAY BACK INTO OUR OWN LINES WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DAMAGE BUT WE DID SOME RAPID WRIGGLING YOU CAN BET THERE WASN'T ANY TIME WASTED BY ANY OF US AND INASMUCH AS WE WERE APPARENTLY OUTNUMBERED
AND PROMPTLY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THEY STARTED UPON THE DANGEROUS MISSION WITH NIGHTFALL THE BIG CANNONADING HAD NOTICEABLY SHUT DOWN
WELL TELL THEM ALL ABOUT IT DEMANDED TOM RAWLE IMPATIENT AT FRANK'S UNWILLINGNESS TO TALK MUCH ABOUT HIMSELF
BUT SOME OTHER GERMAN AVIATORS SAW THE AFFAIR APPARENTLY RECOGNIZED OUR UNIFORMS AND HARDLY GAVE US TIME TO MAKE A DECENT START SAY JERRY CONCLUDED THEY CERTAINLY DID PEBBLE US WITH MACHINE GUN BULLETS
AS THE TAUBE CAME WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE GROUND AND RIGHTED HERSELF FOR A LANDING
LIKE THE AWAKENING CALL THAT COMES TO A MAN IN A SOUND SLEEP
LEAD ENEMY TO BELIEVE WHOLE ATTACK CENTERED FROM YOUR POSITION
AND THE OTHER GERMAN PLANES TURNED BACK TOWARD THEIR OWN LINES THE TAUBE CONTINUED ON ITS WAVERING CRIPPLED DOWNWARD COURSE TOWARD THE ALLIED LINES
A TRIFLE HEAVY GET THAT WILL YOU ECHOED JERRY WITH A GALE OF LAUGHTER A TRIFLE HEAVY OH MY YOU'LL FIND OUT IF I SIT ON YOU SLIM THREATENED IN A BELLIGERENT TONE
THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT IT SEEMED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING A TRAIL WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS LEADING HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE OBJECT OF THE HUNT AND IT WAS IN FORGING THE LINKS OF THIS CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE YOUNG OFFICER WAS LED INTO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
THERE WAS A GASP OF ASTONISHMENT FROM JOE FOLLOWED BY A LOUDER HOLY SMOKE FROM SLIM DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN THE CAPTAIN ASKED IN A SHARP TONE I SHOULD SAY I DO SIR JOE RESPONDED
WON'T DO IT SLIM MUTTERED OH YES YOU WILL COUNSELED JOE SHAKE HANDS THE TWO OF YOU SLIM'S GOOD NATURE OVERCAME HIS FEIGNED RELUCTANCE BUT AS JERRY GRASPED HIS HAND HE GAVE JERRY A JERK THAT NEARLY TOOK HIM OFF HIS FEET NOW WE'RE SQUARE SAID SLIM
KNOWING THEY HAVE IMPORTANT WORK TO DO AND FEELING CAPABLE OF DOING IT WELL
THE LAD REPEATED THEM FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE CAPTAIN
IT WOULD BE TIRESOME AND MONOTONOUS WORK ALL RIGHT
WAS RAPPING DESPERATELY UPON THAT PIPE AND IN THE LONG AND SHORT DASHES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE THAT SOMEONE WAS REPEATING A SINGLE WORD HELP HELP HELP IN ANOTHER INSTANT USING THE HEAVY END OF HIS JACKKNIFE AS A CRUDE TRANSMITTER SLIM WAS TAPPING OFF THE REPLY
LET THIS BE A WARNING THAT NO FURTHER INTERFERENCE WILL BE OF AVAIL THE CAPTAIN LOOKED FROM THE NOTE TO THE CHAIN
BEFORE I COULD UTTER A WORD I WAS A PRISONER BEHIND A LOCKED DOOR I CALLED SEVERAL TIMES AND
AT THAT MOMENT JERRY CAME HURRYING DOWN THE DECK HE WAS VISIBLY EXCITED BUT
M O T H E R I N G
THE OTHERS RUSHED TO THE STERN OF THE SHIP FAR BEHIND THEM IN THE FOAMY TRAIL LEFT ON THE MOONLIT WATER BY THE VESSEL THEY SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE HEAD OF A MAN BOBBING UP AND DOWN AND THEN IT ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED THE SHIP WAS TURNED
AND THE LATTER IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A QUICK EXAMINATION OF HIS ENGINE AND TIRES WHICH PROMISED ANOTHER EARLY MOVE WE GO FORWARD AS FAR AS WE CAN BY AUTOMOBILE AGAIN THE LIEUTENANT INFORMED THEM
AND HE STARTED DOWN THE PASSAGEWAY TOWARD A NARROW STAIRS LEADING TO A STILL LOWER CHAMBER IN THE VESSEL THREE TURNS TWO TO THE RIGHT AND ONE TO THE LEFT AND THE CAPTAIN STOPPED AGAIN TO LISTEN SEEMINGLY FROM WITHIN THE WALL RIGHT AT THEIR ELBOWS THERE CAME A FEEBLE KNOCK
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE'D CAUGHT THE MAN THE DOCTOR WHISPERED
WELL THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED STERNLY WHY ALL THE HASTE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON SLIM BLURTED OUT HE'S LOCKED IN A CLOSET DOWN NEAR THE ENGINE ROOM LOCKED IN A CLOSET THE CAPTAIN REPEATED INCREDULOUSLY HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT WAS POUNDING AWAY AT THE ENEMY IN TERRIBLE DETONATIONS THAT SHOOK AND ROCKED THE GROUND EVERY MINUTE AT THE SECOND LINE TRENCHES THEIR ORDERS CALLED FOR A HALT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE TOLD THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOING
AND AFTER DARK TO NIGHT WE ARE TO ESTABLISH AN OUTLYING COMMUNICATION FROM THE FARTHEST SKIRMISH POINTS TO HEADQUARTERS ALMOST AS HE FINISHED THE SENTENCE THEY WERE STARTED
AND SOON IN GREAT MEASURE AT LEAST HOSTILITIES WOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR THE NIGHT THEIR WORK COMPLETED
AND WHIN I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
WE ARE NOT SAFE WHILE HE IS FREE
A STATIONARY BALLOON SHOWED WHERE JERRY AND AN OBSERVATION OFFICER WERE DOING DUTY ON THAT FATEFUL DAY JERRY WAS OPERATING A TELEPHONE THAT RAN DIRECTLY TO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS AND HARDLY A MOMENT PASSED WHEN HE WAS NOT REPEATING SOME OBSERVATION OF THE OTHER MAN IN THE BASKET WITH HIM
CAN'T MAKE SELF HEARD CAN YOU HELP THIS IS SLIM THE YOUTH RAPPED BACK UPON THE PIPE CAUGHT YOUR MESSAGE ON DECK AM COMING WITH HELP AT ONCE AND HE DASHED DOWN THE DECK TOWARD THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS ALMOST BOWLING OVER THE CAPTAIN'S AIDE AS HE HURTLED INTO THE SANCTUM OF THE SHIP'S COMMANDER UNANNOUNCED
WHILE TOM RAWLE QUIETLY CHUCKLING AT THE FAT LAD'S MISFORTUNE AIDED HIM TO HIS FEET DOWN FLAT SAID MACKINSON AGAIN AS HE DISCERNED SEVERAL SHADOWS MOVING ACROSS A SPACE A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE TO THE NORTH OF THEM
IT WAS A BLACK NIGHT AND THEY PROCEEDED WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION THEY DID NOT DARE USE THE FLASHLIGHTS THAT EACH OF THEM CARRIED AND FREQUENTLY ALL OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO DROP SUDDENLY FLAT UPON THE GROUND AS A BIG ROCKET WENT UP FROM EITHER SIDE
WELL SAID JOE I THINK I'VE GOT A PLAN THAT WILL WORK BUT
EXAMINED THE MAP AGAIN TO MAKE CERTAIN OF THEIR LOCATION
AND YOU STOOPED TO PICK UP WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HAD BEEN THROWN AWAY
INCLUDING FOOD AND AMMUNITION TRAINS
BROUGHT THE ENTIRE DOOR FROM ITS HINGES
FOUND HIM LOCKED IN A SMALL COMPARTMENT DOWN NEAR THE AUXILIARY ENGINE ROOM THE COMMANDER SAID BRIEFLY
FOR FULLY TEN MINUTES WHICH SEEMED LIKE AN HOUR THEY LAY THERE NOT DARING TO MOVE THEY WATCHED THE ENEMY SCOUTING PARTY GET A LIKE SCARE AND THEN AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO BE A WHISPERED CONSULTATION TURN BACK TO THE GERMAN LINES
THE SENIOR OFFICER OF THE VESSEL TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE CROSS WITH ITS TWO BITS OF CHAIN STILL DANGLING FROM IT HE PLACED THE ENDS TO THE CHAIN WHICH JERRY HAD FOUND IN THE WIRELESS ROOM YOU ARE RIGHT HE SAID SIMPLY AND THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
IT WAS A SURPRISE ATTACK IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD WITH ALL THE TERRIBLE CARNAGE THAT SUCH A BATTLE BRINGS
COPPER EXCLAIMED THE LIEUTENANT HOSKINS LET ME HAVE THAT KIT
AND THEIR HIDDEN ARTILLERY TO THE REAR OF THEM THIS WAS KEPT UP FOR ABOUT SEVEN HOURS AND THE DUEL OF HEAVY GUNS SHOOK THE EARTH LIKE A QUAKE AND WAS DEAFENING THEN JUST AS DAWN WAS BREAKING THE INFANTRY ONSLAUGHT
WAS A CONSTANTLY MOVING LINE OF MOTOR TRUCKS COMING FORWARD WITH MEN AND SHELLS WHILE OUT AHEAD OF THEM TREMENDOUS AND MENACING BIG TANKS
EVERY DETAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BATTLE JERRY KNEW HIS OWN OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OVER THE SIDE INFORMED HIM OF THE TEMPORARY REVERSES HIS OWN ARMY WAS SUFFERING WHILE THE REMARKS OF THE OFFICER TOLD HIM WHERE THE GERMANS WERE MEETING THEIR BITTEREST REPULSES
AND RESTFUL SLUMBER SLUMBER THAT WAS TO FIT THEM FOR HARD AND DIFFICULT DUTIES AHEAD THIS IS WHERE WE GET OFF FINALLY ANNOUNCED LIEUTENANT MACKINSON SHAKING THE LADS INTO WAKEFULNESS
CHAPTER EIGHT THE DEATH OF THE SPY
I WAS GROPING MY WAY ALONG WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD STEPS JUST AHEAD OF ME I STOPPED TO LISTEN AND WHEN THE SOUND WAS NOT REPEATED I PROCEEDED ONWARD
HOSKINS KNOWS EXPLAINED RAWLE FOR HE GOT NEARER THAN I DID ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME FRANK CORRECTED MODESTLY BUT THEY CALLED IT MY BAPTISM OF FIRE I WAS OUT ONE NIGHT WITH AN ADVANCE PARTY WE WERE NEARLY AMBUSHED AND HAD TO BEAT A QUICK RETREAT
TWO MORE ATTEMPTS AND THE PANEL FELL IN STRIPS TO THE FLOOR THUS GIVEN SOMETHING FOR A GRIP HOLD THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS A MASSIVE MAN TOOK HOLD WITH BOTH HANDS
AS THEY ALL LEANED OVER HIS DESK TO FOLLOW THE TRACING OF HIS PENCIL WITH WHICH HE SHOWED THEM THE COURSE THEY WERE TO TAKE
AND IT WAS A SURPRISE PARTY FOR FAIR I CAN TELL YOU
JOE REMARKED UPON IT IN TONES OF OPEN ADMIRATION IT'S NOTHING THE YOUTHFUL CHAUFFEUR REPLIED YOU'LL GET USED TO IT TOO AS HE TURNED THE AUTOMOBILE AND STARTED BACKWARD SLIM SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT THEY HADN'T EVEN HEARD HIS NAME DON'T KNOW IT SAID HOSKINS
BLACK ENDLESS NIGHTS DAWN CAME
WHERE THEY WERE DRAWING UP THEIR HEAVIEST FORCES OF RESERVES WHAT QUICK CHANGES WERE BEING MADE IN THEIR GENERAL LINE OF FORMATION AND HOW FAR BACK THEIR FORCES SEEMED TO EXTEND SLIM GOODWIN
CHAPTER SEVEN THE TIMELY RESCUE IT WAS NO PLEASANT THOUGHT TO CONTEMPLATE THE PRESENCE OF A BOLD
IN THIS WAY THEY WENT FORWARD YARD BY YARD UNTIL THEY REACHED A THICK CLUMP OF TREES THERE AFTER LISTENING INTENTLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITHOUT HEARING A DANGEROUS SOUND THEY SPREAD OUT THEIR COATS TENT LIKE WHILE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON WITH GINGERLY FLASHES OF HIS LIGHT
DID YOU GET WITHIN SOUND OF THE BIG GUNS ASKED SLIM EXCITEDLY I SHOULD SAY SO ANSWERED TOM RAWLE AND SO WILL YOU WITHIN A FEW HOURS ISN'T THAT SO HOSKINS YES ANSWERED FRANK
TO THE THREE BOYS UNABLE TO SEE OR TALK TO EACH OTHER AND JOE AND JERRY SCARCELY DARING TO MOVE THE MINUTES LAGGED LIKE HOURS
EQUIPPED WITH GUNS AND MEN THAT COULD TRAVEL WITH THEIR OWN POWER PRACTICALLY ANYWHERE ACROSS SHELL HOLES OVER TRENCHES THROUGH BARBED WIRE
HIS HEART ACTION IS PRETTY WEAK EVEN YET
AT THE SAME INSTANT THE PRISONER
TO MAKE SURE THAT THUS FAR HIS FRIEND WAS STILL SAFE
WELL WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION SLIM DEMANDED THAT WE DIVIDE OUR FORCES ANSWERED JOE SOLEMNLY LIE IN WAIT AND TRY TO AMBUSH THE FOE RIGHT CRIED JERRY JOE YOU'LL BE A GENERAL BEFORE THIS WAR'S OVER
A FEW HOURS LATER THAT SAME NIGHT HE RETURNS TO THE BATTERY ROOM AND SUCCEEDS IN RECOVERING THE PORTABLE INSTRUMENT TO DAY LIEUTENANT MACKINSON WHILE PURSUING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE AFFAIR
IN THE EASTERN PART OF FRANCE THEY CAME UPON ACTUAL WAR IN ALL ITS FATEFUL PROGRESS WITH WHOLE TOWNS DEMOLISHED FORESTS AND ORCHARDS BLOTTED OUT STARK RUIN WRITTEN OVER THE FACE OF THE EARTH
SAY THAT MUST BE THRILLING TO BE A MEMBER OF AN ADVANCE PARTY LIKE THAT SAID JERRY HIS ENTHUSIASM AS FIERY AS HIS HAIR I WONDER IF WE'LL GET ANY WORK LIKE THAT YOU SURE WILL RESPONDED RAWLE AND PLENTY OF IT YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ON THAT SCORE
MORE EASILY HANDLED AEROPLANES AND USED IN GREAT NUMBERS BY THE GERMANS SHOT INTO THE AIR AT GREAT SPEED FROM BEHIND THE BOCHE ENTRENCHMENTS
THE WAVERING SWAYING TARGET WAS WATCHED FROM TIME TO TIME AND SPECULATIONS MADE AS TO HOW LONG IT COULD REMAIN WITHOUT BEING PUNCTURED BY A BULLET
HE HAD RELAPSED AGAIN AND THERE WAS ANOTHER WAIT OF SEVERAL MINUTES BUT THIS TIME THE LIEUTENANT'S MIND WAS CLEARING SOMEBODY SHOVED ME IN THAT CLOSET HE GASPED AND THEN SLAMMED AND LOCKED THE DOOR HE RECOGNIZED THE CAPTAIN AND THE DOCTOR
THERE WAS A STRAINED SILENCE FOR A MOMENT THEN
WELL I'LL COVER THE BATTERY ROOM SAID SLIM IGNORING JERRY'S REMARK LET'S SEE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON THEN SUGGESTED JOE AND THEY WENT TO FIND THE YOUNG OFFICER WHO WAS CONVALESCING FROM HIS ENCOUNTER WITH THE SPY WHEN HE HAD APPROVED THE PLAN THEY GOT THE O K OF THE CAPTAIN
FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH AVIATORS HAD BEEN REPORTING HEAVY GERMAN FORMATIONS IN THAT REGION EVIDENTLY WITH THE DESIGN OF A TERRIFIC ASSAULT BUT THE ALLIED COMMANDERS HAD NOT EXPECTED IT SO SOON AND IN TRUTH THEY WERE NOT FULLY PREPARED FOR IT
I'M WILLING SAID JERRY BUT YOU AND I WILL HAVE TO DO THE OUTSIDE WORK
I WILL ARRANGE FOR ANOTHER MAN TO STAY IN THE WIRELESS ROOM DURING TO DAY
GONE SAID THE CAPTAIN IN TONES OF VERY EVIDENT RELIEF WELL IT WAS DEATH FOR HIM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND HE TOOK HIS CHOICE AS THE CAPTAIN AND SURGEON MOVED AWAY FROM THE STERN RAIL OF THE EVERETT
EVERYTHING MOVED LIKE CLOCKWORK AND WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SPEED AND THROUGHOUT IT ALL MEN ON BOTH SIDES WERE SHOOTING SHOUTING SHRIEKING
A VERY SMALL TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT THE INSTANT IT WAS ATTACHED TO THE WIRE THE RECEIVER BEGAN TO TICK IRREGULARLY NEITHER RAWLE NOR HOSKINS UNDERSTOOD GERMAN BUT TO THE OTHERS THEY WERE WORDS EASY TO TRANSLATE THEY HAD ACCIDENTALLY STRUCK AN ENEMY WIRE AND HAD TAPPED IT
THE SEA IS CALM AND WE READILY COULD DISCERN A PERISCOPE A LONG DISTANCE AWAY TRULY IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT AND IT WAS IN THIS ALLURING QUIET OF SEEMINGLY ABSOLUTE PEACE
THE AMERICAN PLANES MANEUVERED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ENCIRCLE THE TAUBE
AND TO DO THAT HE WILL HAVE TO USE THE WIRELESS SOMEHOW IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS EFFORT AT NIGHT
HE GAVE A TELEGRAPHIC CALL FOR HELP ON THE STEAM PIPE WHICH RUNS THROUGH THERE AND CONNECTS WITH THE WHISTLE THE LAD EXPLAINED I WAS ON DECK AND HEARD IT I TALKED WITH HIM OVER THE PIPE THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE THEN COME WITH ME AND THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF HURRIEDLY LED THE WAY DOWN THROUGH THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
THEY HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO THE QUARTERS OF MAJOR JONES IN CHARGE OF THE SIGNAL CORPS MEN IN THAT SECTION AND IT WAS WITH CONSIDERABLE SURPRISE THAT THE BOYS LEARNED UPON ARRIVING THERE THAT THEY WERE TO ACCOMPANY THE LIEUTENANT INTO THE SUPERIOR OFFICER'S PRESENCE FOR INSTRUCTIONS
HE POINTED HER NOSE DOWNWARD TOWARD THE AMERICAN LINES FOUR AMERICAN PLANES SAILED OFF AND UPWARD TO MEET THE ONCOMING GERMAN AIR ARMADA BUT FROM THE GROUND IT COULD BE SEEN THAT THE MAN IN THE OBSERVER'S PLACE IN THE TAUBE WAS MAKING DESPERATE SIGNALS
GOT HERE TWO WEEKS AGO THE BIG FELLOW ANSWERED
THEY STOOD SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN FAINT AND INDISTINCT APPARENTLY FROM SOMEWHERE SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THEM THEY BOTH HEARD REPEATED THAT WHICH HAD MADE SLIM STOP
WAS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT JERRY AND SLIM FROM TAKING A FULL EIGHT HOURS OF MUCH NEEDED SLEEP WHILE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON JOE AND THREE OTHER OFFICERS WHOM THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN INTO HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE MATTER FOLLOWED OUT EVERY POSSIBLE CLUE IN PURSUIT OF A SOLUTION OF THE BAFFLING MYSTERY
BUT ON THE EIGHTH DAY A VERITABLE FURY LAUNCHED ITSELF UPON THAT SECTION OF THE AMERICAN FRENCH FRONT IN THE SHAPE OF SEEMINGLY ENDLESS BRIGADES OF BOCHES THAT WERE HURLED OVER THE TOP OF THEIR OWN BREASTWORKS ACROSS NO MAN'S LAND AND UPON THE FIRST LINE TRENCHES OF THE ALLIES
OPENING THEM THE BOYS COULD HARDLY SUPPRESS THEIR JUBILATION STRIPPED OF THEIR OFFICIAL VERBIAGE THE LETTERS INFORMED THE YOUNG MEN THAT EACH OF THEM WAS MADE A CORPORAL JOE FOR VALOROUS SERVICE IN SAVING THE LIVES OF THREE AMERICANS ENTOMBED IN A CAVE
EVIDENTLY ALSO FROM THE BOILER OR ENGINE ROOM BRUSHED BY US HE HAD DISAPPEARED WHEN THE SAILOR SAID TO ME I THINK THAT WAS THE FELLOW THE ONE THAT JUST WENT BY NOT WANTING TO AROUSE HIS SUSPICIONS I ENDED THE CONVERSATION WITH A CASUAL REMARK AND THEN STROLLED AWAY UNTIL I WAS OUT OF THE SAILOR'S SIGHT
WHILE EACH SIDE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK AND MADE NECESSARY REPAIRS OR ALTERED THEIR PLANS TO MEET THE NEW SITUATION OUR YOUNG FRIENDS WERE BUSY WITH WASH BASIN SOAP AND WATER
NEARLY SUFFOCATED TOO
AND FROM THEM THEY HEARD MANY SERIOUS AND AMUSING STORIES MANY TRUE TALES OF THE ATTACK AND RETREAT OF SHOT AND SHELL AND SHRAPNEL AND THE HAND GRENADE AND THE POISONOUS GAS BOMBS THROWN BY THE BOCHES AND THEN ONE BY ONE THE SOLDIERS OF UNCLE SAM DROPPED OFF INTO LONG
AND HIS MIND WEIGHTED ANYWAY WITH THE MENACING MYSTERY OF THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE HE SAT DOWN ON A COIL OF ROPE JUST IN THE LEE OF THE FORWARD SMOKESTACK TO THINK THE WHOLE MATTER OVER FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME HE WAS THUS ABSORBED WHEN SOMETHING AT FIRST VAGUE AND INDEFINITE THEN CLEARER
WERE PURSUING THEIR UNEVEN COURSE TOWARD THE FRONT IN PREPARATION FOR A NEW KIND OF ASSAULT THEY LOOK LIKE MINIATURE BATTLESHIPS ON LAND DON'T THEY EXCLAIMED SLIM
AWAIT ME HERE HE SAID TO THE FIVE MEN UNDER HIS IMMEDIATE COMMAND
WHEN I RETURNED I FOUND THIS LYING UPON THE TABLE HE OPENED HIS LEFT HAND IN IT LAY A PIECE OF LIGHT CHAIN BOTH ENDS BROKEN BESIDE IT HE CONTINUED WAS THIS NOTE FROM HIS POCKET HE EXTRACTED A PIECE OF PAPER THE EDGES OF WHICH WERE ROUGHLY TORN
WE HAVE A LONG TRIP BEFORE US LIEUTENANT MACKINSON INFORMED THEM AND WE LEAVE HERE ON A SPECIAL TRAIN IN TWO HOURS IN A SHORT TIME WE WILL BE IN THE THICK OF IT
THE OFFICER WHIPPED OUT A POCKET FLASHLIGHT THEY WERE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF A HEAVY WOODEN DOOR IT WAS LOCKED
IT WAS THAT SAME DAY THAT THE THREE BOYS FROM BRIGHTON WERE FOR THE FIRST TIME ASSIGNED TO A REGULAR UNIT OF THE SIGNAL CORPS ALSO WITH A REAL THRILL THEY LEARNED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO SEE WAR SERVICE FOR AMERICAN TROOPS WERE ALREADY IN THE TRENCHES
EVERY MOMENT IT BECAME MORE STIFLING IN THERE AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT I HAD WALKED DIRECTLY INTO A DEATH TRAP IT WAS THEN I BEGAN SIGNALING ON THE STEAM PIPE I GUESS IT WAS A MIGHTY LUCKY THING FOR ME THAT SLIM GOODWIN STROLLED OUT ON DECK JUST AT THE TIME HE DID
IT WAS NOW WELL INTO THE AFTERNOON THE GERMANS HAD SWEPT INTO THE PLACES VACATED BY THE AMERICANS AND FRENCH AND STILL THE BATTLE RAGED IT WAS NOW THAT SLIM BEGAN TO WAIT ANXIOUSLY FOR THE NEW DEVELOPMENT
SO SAID THE CAPTAIN IN A VOICE SO STERN IT MADE JOE WINCE
AND NO SIGNATURE I BELIEVE SIR SAID JERRY
FRANK HOSKINS ELBOW WOUND HEALED QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS RESULTS AND TOM RAWLE WHO HAD BEEN UNDER TREATMENT AT THE FIELD HOSPITAL WAS ABLE TO GET ABOUT THE CAMP
HE WAS A MAN THEY FOUND ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD ALREADY GRIZZLED AND HARDENED BY HIS FIELD EXPERIENCE AND HE KNEW HOW TO CONVEY ORDERS AND TRANSACT BUSINESS WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY YOU ARE TO FOLLOW THE RED INK LINES ON THIS MAP HE TOLD LIEUTENANT MACKINSON
THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER WAS A MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OF A MAN BUT HIS VOICE BROKE OFF AS THE COMMOTION STARTED AGAIN CERTAINLY HE MUST HAVE A ROUGH CUSTOMER TO DEAL WITH THOUGHT JERRY
HE IS THE MAN WHO WAS PLANTING AMMUNITION IN THE WATERS NEAR THE NAVY YARD THAT NIGHT BEFORE WE SAILED THE VERY SAME ONE SIR SLIM EXCLAIMED WITH EQUAL POSITIVENESS THE SHIP'S SURGEON WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE OTHERS UPON DECK STEPPED CLOSER FOR A BETTER INSPECTION OF THIS ENEMY
JERRY HAD SOME LETTERS TO WRITE SO SLIM WENT TO THE UPPER DECK ALONE
ALL READY THEY ANSWERED AND THE LIEUTENANT LED THE WAY TO THE TRAIN
IT WAS A CASE OF WATCH EVERYBODY TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION AND BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING ONLY NINE MEN ON THE VESSEL HOWEVER INCLUDING THE SPY HIMSELF KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
LONG STRINGS OF POWERFUL MOTOR TRUCKS DRIVING TOWARD THE SCENE OF ACTION THEY CAME UPON TOWNS AND VILLAGES IN THAT AREA KNOWN AS BEHIND THE LINES WHERE FRENCH AMERICAN BELGIAN AND BRITISH SOLDIERS WERE RECUPERATING AFTER HARD DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE FRONT LINE TRENCHES
TAKING OFF THE GRIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE EVENING MEAL AND WONDERING WHERE JERRY WAS KEEPING HIMSELF ALL THE WHILE WHEN SUDDENLY A VERY STRANGE THING HAPPENED BEYOND THE ENEMY'S LINE
FOR A FEW STEPS THEY FELT THEIR WAY ALONG AND THEN STOPPED TO LISTEN THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE DULL AND CONSTANT HUM OF THE ENGINES AND THE ALMOST INSUFFERABLE HEAT
THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF GOING ANY LENGTHS IF NECESSARY ALREADY HAD BEEN PROVED AND THE EVIDENCE OF HIS EVIL GENIUS MIGHT COME IN HORRIBLE FORM AT ANY INSTANT NEVERTHELESS
ON AND ON THEY WENT AND NEARER AND NEARER TO THE SCENE OF ACTUAL BATTLE THEY CAME THEY PASSED THE THIRD LINE TRENCHES AND NOW IN PLACES THEY SEEMED TO BE IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITH SOME OF THE CONCEALED ARTILLERY
ALONG WHAT LINES DO WE DISPERSE OUR FORCES GENERAL ASKED SLIM ALONG WHAT LINES WOULD HIS ROYAL STOUTNESS SUGGEST DEMANDED JERRY OH YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING ME THAT I'M A TRIFLE HEAVY SLIM REPLIED IN A PEEVISH TONE
WITHOUT THE WASTE OF A MOMENT THEY CLIMBED IN LIEUTENANT MACKINSON OUR THREE FRIENDS YOUNG HOSKINS AND THE TOWERING RAWLE IN ANOTHER INSTANT THEY WERE SPEEDING ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THE BREAK OF DAWN
PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER TO DEVISE A SCHEME OF CAPTURE WE'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE GOOD REASON FOR WANTING TO GET THIS FELLOW SLIM REMINDED THE OTHERS WITH CONSIDERABLE WARMTH
THE LIEUTENANT COULD BE IN THE WIRELESS ROOM AND ONE OF US IN THE BATTERY ROOM WHILE THE OTHER TWO DID DUTY OUTSIDE
IN PREPARATION FOR A GREAT INFANTRY ADVANCE BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS TIME THEY EXPECT TO GO FORWARD BEFORE THE END OF TO DAY WHICH MEANS ADDED LIEUTENANT MACKINSON
THE GREAT SIX MONTHS BATTLE OF THE SOMME WITH ITS MILLION CASUALTIES WAS RESULTING FAVORABLY ON THE EAST THE RUSSIANS HAD MADE SOME GAINS THERE WERE WAGERS THAT THE GERMANS WOULD BE DONE IN THE SPRING
SHE WAS HOLDING OUT BOTH HANDS TO HIM PITEOUSLY YOU WOULDN'T GO WOULD YOU I MIGHT HAVE TO GO HE EVADED YOU WOULDN'T GRAHAM YOU'RE ALL I HAVE ALL I HAVE LEFT TO LIVE FOR YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO GO IT'S RIDICULOUS YOU'RE NEEDED HERE
THEY MET THERE SMOKED HER CIGARETS MADE LOVE IN A CORNER OCCASIONALLY BECAME ENGAGED BUT SHE WAS OF THE GAME NO LONGER IN IT MEN STILL CAME TO SEE HER A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF THEM MARRIED
SAID A GOOD HUMOURED VOICE IT CAME FROM ONE OF TWO FACTORY GIRLS WHO WERE PASSING HER STALL AND STOPPED THEY WERE GAILY DRESSED A LIGHT HANDKERCHIEF TIED UNDER THE CHIN THEIR HAIR SCRUPULOUSLY ARRANGED THEY WORE CORAL NECK LACES AND EARRINGS OF GOLD
ENCOURAGED BY HER INTEREST HE ELABORATED ON THE NEW WORK HE EVEN DEVELOPED AN ENTHUSIASM FOR IT TO HIS OWN SURPRISE AND THE GIRL LISTENED INTENTLY LEANING FORWARD SO THAT HER ARM BRUSHED HIS SHOULDER
THEY DO US ALL WIDOW THEY PRETENDS TO GIVE THE SAME WAGES AS THE REST AND WORKS IT OUT IN FINES YOU CAN'T COME AND YOU CAN'T GO BUT THERE'S A FINE YOU'RE NEVER PAID WAGES BUT THERE'S A BATE TICKET
BUT AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR I MUST HAVE LIFE THE MOMENT I CAME OUT I BATHED IN THE RIVER AND THEN WENT HOME AND DRESSED HE ADDED IN A SATISFIED TONE AND NOW I AM GOING TO THE TEMPLE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT JULIA HAS BEEN PRICKED TO DAY WITH A SHUTTLE
I'LL STAND TREAT AND TAKE YOU AND YOUR FRIEND TO THE TEMPLE WELL THAT'S DELIGHT SAID CAROLINE THERE'S NO ONE DOES THE HANDSOME THING LIKE YOU DANDY MICK AND I ALWAYS SAY SO OH I LOVE THE TEMPLE TIS SO GENTEEL
I'VE HEARD THEY KEEP THEIR WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT ON FACTORY FINES SOUL ALIVE BUT THOSE SHUFFLE AND SCREW ARE ROTTEN SNICKEY BAD YARNS SAID MISTRESS CAREY
THREE CARS BEFORE THE HOUSE SHOWED THAT SHE ALREADY HAD CALLERS AND INDEED WHEN THE PARLOR MAID OPENED THE DOOR A BURST OF LAUGHTER GREETED HIM THE HAYDEN HOUSE WAS A GENERAL RENDEZVOUS THERE WERE USUALLY BY SEVEN O'CLOCK WHISKEY AND SODA GLASSES
STILL OFFERED MANY TEMPTATIONS TO MANY WHO COULD NOT PURCHASE AND SO IT IS WIDOW SAID A LITTLE PALE MAN WISTFULLY COME COME IT'S GETTING LATE AND YOUR WIFE'S ILL YOU'RE A GOOD SOUL
YOU SENT UP FOR SNICKS I HAVE KNOWN YOU MAN AND BOY JOHN HILL THESE TWENTY SUMMERS AND NEVER HEARD A WORD AGAINST YOU TILL YOU GOT INTO SHUFFLE AND SCREW'S MILL OH THEY ARE A BAD YARN JOHN
THAT THE SUBMARINE SINKINGS WERE COLOSSAL OUR PEACE WAS AT A FEARFUL COST AND ON THE EDGE OF THIS VOLCANO AMERICA PLAYED WHEN GRAHAM SPENCER LEFT THE MILL THAT TUESDAY AFTERNOON IT WAS TO VISIT MARION HAYDEN
MORLEY PAUSED AS HE RECOGNISED EGREMONT THEN ADVANCING TO GERARD FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANION HE SAID THIS IS MISTER HATTON OF WHOM WE WERE SPEAKING LAST NIGHT AND WHO CLAIMS TO BE AN ANCIENT ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS
BY NARROW ARCHWAYS LIKE THE ENTRANCE OF HIVES SO LOW THAT YOU WERE OBLIGED TO STOOP FOR ADMISSION WHILE ASCENDING TO THESE SAME STREETS FROM THEIR DANK AND DISMAL DWELLINGS BY NARROW FLIGHTS OF STEPS
A HIGH CROWNED DARK BROWN HAT WHICH RELIEVED HIS COMPLEXION AND HEIGHTENED THE EFFECT OF HIS MISCHIEVOUS BLUE EYE WELL YOU NEED NOT BE SO FIERCE MOTHER CAREY SAID THE YOUTH WITH AN AFFECTED AIR OF DEPRECATION
PERHAPS I SHOULD RATHER SAY OF YOUR POOR DEAR FATHER SAID HATTON SCANNING GERARD WITH HIS CLEAR BLUE EYE AND THEN HE ADDED HE WAS OF GREAT SERVICE TO ME IN MY YOUTH AND ONE IS NOT APT TO FORGET SUCH THINGS
SHE HAD THE FAR VISION OF THE CALCULATING MIND SHE KNEW THAT IF THE COUNTRY ENTERED THE WAR EVERY ELIGIBLE MAN SHE KNEW WOULD IMMEDIATELY VOLUNTEER AT TWENTY FIVE SHE ALREADY NOTICED A CHANGE IN THE PERSONNEL OF HER FOLLOWERS
THE READY TRIBUTE OF THE BOY'S SYMPATHY SIT DOWN GRAHAM I WANT TO TALK TO YOU HE SAT DOWN STILL UNEASILY FINGERING THE ROLL OF BILLS
BUT POPULAR ASSEMBLIES BREED TURBULENT SPIRITS SYBIL YOUR FATHER TAKES A LEADING PART HE IS A GREAT ORATOR AND IS IN HIS ELEMENT IN THIS CLAMOROUS AND FIERY LIFE IT DOES NOT MUCH SUIT ME I AM A MAN OF THE CLOSET
HE WOULD PROPOSE THAT I SHOULD AT ONCE ACCOMPANY HIM I THOUGHT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE RESULT IT MUST BE A SATISFACTION TO GERARD AT LAST TO SEE THIS MAN OF WHOM HE HAS TALKED AND THOUGHT SO MUCH AND SO WE ARE HERE
HE HELD HIMSELF VERY STRAIGHT AS HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND THE BOYISH GRIN WITH WHICH HE CUSTOMARILY GREETED THE BUTLER HAD GIVEN PLACE TO A DIGNIFIED NOD NATALIE WAS IN HER DRESSING ROOM AT HIS KNOCK SHE TOLD THE MAID TO ADMIT HIM
WE'LL GO IN AND STIR UP SOME OF THE LOVERS SHE SUGGESTED AND IF TOMMY HALE HASN'T BURNED UP THE PIANO WE CAN DANCE A BIT YOU DANCE DIVINELY YOU KNOW IT WAS AFTER SEVEN WHEN HE REACHED HOME HE FELT EVERY INCH A MAN
WELL WE HAD NO THOUGHTS BUT I SAID TO HARRIET AS IT IS A FINE NIGHT LET US WALK ABOUT AS LONG AS WE CAN AND THEN TO MORROW WE WILL LIE IN BED TILL AFTERNOON
AND SO ON THROUGH A VARIETY OF WAYS AND WINDING LANES TILL THEY ARRIVED AT AN OPEN PORTION OF THE TOWN A DISTRICT WHERE STREETS AND SQUARES AND EVEN ROWS DISAPPEARED AND WHERE THE TALL CHIMNEYS AND BULKY BARRACK LOOKING BUILDINGS
SHE IGNORED HIS PROTEST AS SHE ALWAYS IGNORED PROTESTS AGAINST HER OWN METHODS OF HANDLING MATTERS I'M ACCUSTOMED TO IT WAS HER SOLE REPLY BUT HER RESIGNED VOICE BROUGHT HER AS IT ALWAYS HAD
YOU DID WELL GOOD STEPHEN AS YOU ALWAYS DO SAID SYBIL WITH A MUSING AND ABSTRACTED AIR NO ONE HAS SO MUCH FORETHOUGHT AND SO MUCH ENERGY AS YOU HE THREW A GLANCE AT HER AND IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW IT THEIR EYES HAD MET
IN THE INFANCY OF MOWBRAY BY SOME MILL OWNER NOT SUFFICIENTLY PROPHETIC OF THE FUTURE OR SUFFICIENTLY CONFIDENT IN THE ENERGY AND ENTERPRISE OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS TO FORESEE THAT THE SCENE OF HIS LABOURS
KEPT ITS SECRET WELL AND CONTINUED TO PREACH A NEUTRALITY IT COULD NOT ENFORCE WAR WAS TO MOST OF THE NATION A GREAT DRAMATIC SPECTACLE PRESENTED TO THEM AT BREAKFAST AND IN THE AFTERNOON EDITIONS
WHILE ON EACH SIDE OF THE STREET ROSE HUGE WAREHOUSES NOT AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE PALACES OF VENICE BUT IN THEIR WAY NOT LESS REMARKABLE MAGNIFICENT SHOPS AND HERE AND THERE THOUGH RARELY SOME ANCIENT FACTORY BUILT AMONG THE FIELDS
AND IF YOU LIKE TO TAKE THIS SCRAG END HOME TO YOUR WIFE NEIGHBOUR HILL WE CAN TALK OF THE REST NEXT SATURDAY AND WHAT'S YOUR WILL SIR SAID THE WIDOW WITH A STERN EXPRESSION TO A YOUTH WHO NOW STOPPED AT HER STALL
WAS THE BEAUTY OF YOUTH ONLY AND THAT THAT WAS GOING LATE HOURS GOLF PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE CHAMPAGNE THAN WAS NECESSARY AT DINNERS AND THE MORNINGS FOUND HER ALMOST PLAIN AND TOO
HER EYES SLIGHTLY NARROWED WATCHED HIM CLOSELY SHE KNEW EVERY MOVE OF THE GAME SHE WAS DETERMINING TO PLAY MARION HAYDEN AT TWENTY FIVE KNEW ALREADY WHAT HER LITTLE WORLD HAD NOT YET REALIZED THAT SUCH BEAUTY AS SHE HAD HAD
LAWFULLY MEETING IN OPEN DAY AND THEIR DELEGATES FROM THE WHOLE REALM DECLARING THEIR GRIEVANCES IN LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD NOT DISGRACE THE CONQUERING RACE WHICH HAS IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED TO DEGRADE THEM
WELL DO YOU REMEMBER HALF THE PRETTY THINGS YOU TOLD ME LAST NIGHT NOT EXACTLY BUT I MEANT THEM HE LOOKED UP AT HER ADMIRINGLY HE WAS ONLY A YEAR FROM COLLEGE AND HE HAD BEEN RATHER ARBITRARILY LIMITED TO THE DEBUTANTES
HE DOUBTLESS HAD THEM NOW AS HE NEVER DESTROYED PAPERS WOULD ORDER A SEARCH TO BE MADE FOR THEM AND SO ON I WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW WHEN HE ASKED ME CARELESSLY A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR FATHER WHAT HE WAS DOING AND WHETHER HE WERE MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN
HAD HE NOT ACCOMPANIED ME TO THIS DOOR AND MET MY FATHER WHICH PRECIPITATED AN EXPLANATION ON HIS PART WHICH HE FOUND HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN BY OTHERS I MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN AN IGNORANCE WHICH HEREAFTER MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED INCONVENIENCE
IT'S VERY WELL KNOWN THAT I'M A MAN WHAT PAYS HIS WAY SAID THE BOY AND DON'T KEEP A HUCKSTER'S STALL TO SELL CARRION BY STAR LIGHT BUT LIVE IN A TWO PAIR IF YOU PLEASE AND HAS A WIFE AND FAMILY OR AS GOOD
MY VISIT TO THIS CITY ALONE HAS TAUGHT ME HOW STRONG ARE OUR ENEMIES BUT I BELIEVED THAT WE HAD ON OUR SIDE GOD AND TRUTH THEY KNOW NEITHER OF THEM IN THE NATIONAL CONVENTION SAID MORLEY
PERMEATED WITH A FAINT SCENT OF LATE AFTERNOON HIGHBALLS TOMMY MARION CALLED WHEN SHE HAD SETTLED HERSELF YES FROM A DISTANCE DID YOU LEAVE YOUR CIGARET ON THE PIANO
MORLEY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN SAID AN EASY QUESTION QUESTIONS ARE ALWAYS EASY THE FACT IS IN ACTIVE LIFE ONE CANNOT AFFORD TO REFINE I COULD HAVE WISHED THE MOVEMENT TO HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT SHAPE
AND I VENTURE TO BELIEVE MY PRAYERS AND VIGILS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED
BUT AGAIN WASHINGTON KNEW THAT THE BRITISH AND FRENCH LOSSES AT THE SOMME HAD BEEN FRIGHTFUL THAT THE AMOUNT OF LOST TERRITORY REGAINED WAS NEGLIGIBLE AS AGAINST THE TERRITORY STILL HELD THAT THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS WAS ACUTE
THAT APPEARANCE WAS PREPOSSESSING A FRANK AND EVEN BENEVOLENT EXPRESSION PLAYED UPON HIS INTELLIGENT AND HANDSOME COUNTENANCE HIS ONCE RICH BROWN HAIR STILL LONG THOUGH VERY THIN
SO IT IS SAID THE GIRL BUT THEN IT WAS SO DULL I CAN'T STAND A COUNTRY LIFE MISSUS CAREY I MUST HAVE COMPANY WELL I DO LOVE A BIT OF GOSSIP MYSELF SAID MISSUS CAREY WITH GREAT FRANKNESS
OH THE CARNAL MONSTERS EXCLAIMED THE WIDOW IF THEIR DAY DON'T COME THE BLOODY MINDED KNAVES AND FOR SMALL COPS TOO SMALL COPS BE HANGED AM I THE MAN TO SEND UP A BAD BOTTOMED COP WIDOW CAREY
THE SUBTERRANEOUS NATION OF THE CELLARS POURED FORTH TO ENJOY THE COOLNESS OF THE SUMMER NIGHT AND MARKET FOR THE DAY OF REST THE BRIGHT AND LIVELY SHOPS WERE CROWDED AND GROUPS OF PURCHASERS WERE GATHERED ROUND THE STALLS
NO TOOTS DEAR BUT I CAN EASILY MOTHER MARION EXPLAINED
FOR THE RED CROSS AND KINDRED ACTIVITIES BUT ALTHOUGH THE WAR WAS IN THE NATION'S MIND IT WAS NOT YET IN ITS SOUL LIFE WENT ON MUCH AS BEFORE AN ABIDING FAITH IN THE ALLIES WAS THE FOUNDATION STONE OF ITS COMPLACENCY
NOT YET BUT OF COURSE I SHALL BE WHEN YOU REALLY GET GOING I WONDER IF YOU WILL TAKE ME ROUND AND SHOW ME HOW SHELLS ARE MADE I'M THE MOST IGNORANT PERSON YOU EVER KNEW I'LL BE AWFULLY GLAD TO
AND I LIKE BIG FIGURES POOR PEOPLE ALWAYS DO HAS IT REALLY GONE THROUGH I MEAN THOSE THINGS DO SLIP UP SOMETIMES DON'T THEY IT'S GONE THROUGH ALL RIGHT SIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED
MILLS AND FACTORIES TOOK ON NEW LIFE LABOR WAS SCARCE AND HIGH IT WAS A PERIOD OF EXTRAVAGANCE RATHER THAN PLEASURE PEOPLE PLAYED THAT THEY MIGHT NOT THINK WASHINGTON CONVINCED THAT THE NATION WOULD ULTIMATELY BE INVOLVED
AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SO MANY STRANGE AND HIGH HOPES AND SOME DARK BLENDING OF DOUBT AND APPREHENSION AND DISCORDANT THOUGHTS HATTON IN HIS APPEARANCE REALISED LITTLE OF THE FANCIES
AND TEA CUPS ON MOST OF THE FURNITURE AND HALF SMOKED CIGARETS ON EVERYTHING THAT WOULD HOLD THEM INCLUDING THE PIANO MARION HERSELF MET HIM IN THE HALL AND LED HIM PAST THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR
DETRACT FROM THE FAVOURABLE EFFECT THAT HE ALWAYS AT ONCE PRODUCED
AND AS HE WAS SPEAKING THESE WORDS HE TURNED AND ADDRESSED THEM TO SYBIL SHE BEHELD HIM WITH NO LITTLE INTEREST THIS MYSTERIOUS NAME THAT HAD SOUNDED SO OFTEN IN HER YOUNG EARS
SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HAD BEEN RANKLING UNDER A SENSE OF YOUTH WAS I PRETTY AWFUL LAST NIGHT HE ASKED YOU WERE VERY INTERESTING AND I IMAGINE RATHER INDISCREET
WOULD BE THE FUTURE EYE SORE OF A FLOURISHING POSTERITY PURSUING THEIR COURSE ALONG CASTLE STREET FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE GERARD AND STEPHEN TURNED DOWN A STREET WHICH INTERSECTED IT
THE FACTIONS AND THE FAILURES OF OUR OPPRESSORS AT THIS MOMENT GERARD AND HATTON WHO WERE SITTING IN THE REMOTE PART OF THE ROOM ROSE TOGETHER AND ADVANCED FORWARD AND THIS MOVEMENT INTERRUPTED THE CONVERSATION OF SYBIL AND MORLEY
WHEN AT A SOUND IN CLAYTON'S ROOM HE STUCK THE MONEY HASTILY INTO HIS POCKET HAVE YOU NOTICED A CHANGE IN YOUR FATHER SINCE HE CAME BACK HER TONE WAS SO OMINOUS THAT HE STARTED HE'S NOT SICK IS HE
THERE CAN BE OTHER THAN ONE AND THE SAME OBJECT A THOUSAND SAID MORLEY WE HAVE ALREADY AS MANY PARTIES AS IN SAINT STEPHEN'S ITSELF YOU TERRIFY ME SAID SYBIL I KNEW WE HAD FEARFUL ODDS TO COMBAT AGAINST
I PROPOSED TO GO WITH HER BUT TWO GIRLS ALONE YOU UNDERSTAND ME ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO BE SEEN IN THESE PLACES AS IF ONE KEPT NO COMPANY VERY TRUE SAID MICK AND NOW WE'LL BE OFF GOOD NIGHT WIDOW
THAT ROSE IN ALL DIRECTIONS CLUSTERING YET ISOLATED ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE IN THE PRINCIPAL SCENE OF THE INDUSTRY OF MOWBRAY CROSSING THIS OPEN GROUND THEY GAINED A SUBURB BUT ONE OF A VERY DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION
OR THE MAYOR OF MOWBRAY AT LEAST WAGES SAID THE MAN I WISH YOU MAY GET EM THOSE VILLAINS SHUFFLE AND SCREW HAVE SARVED ME WITH ANOTHER BATE TICKET AND A PRETTY FIGURE TOO
HE WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN WITH A LITHE FIGURE AND A HANDSOME FADED IMPUDENT FACE HIS LONG LOOSE WHITE TROUSERS GAVE HIM HEIGHT HE HAD NO WAISTCOAT BUT A PINK SILK HANDKERCHIEF WAS TWISTED CARELESSLY ROUND HIS NECK
TO STOP MY TONGUE AND FILL MY STOMACH BY THE TOKEN OF WHICH AS MY GAL SAYS SHE STUNTED THE GROWTH OF THE PRETTIEST FIGURE IN ALL MOWBRAY AND HERE THE YOUTH DREW HIMSELF UP AND THRUST HIS HANDS IN THE SIDE POCKETS OF HIS PEA JACKET WELL
BUT WHEN SHE ASKED FOR SOMETHING THAT MEANT MORE THAN LIFE TO HER IT WAS REFUSED OF COURSE SHE HAD GONE THROUGH ALL SORTS OF HUMILIATION TO GET HIM THAT MONEY AND THIS WAS THE GRATITUDE SHE RECEIVED GRAHAM LISTENED
BUT MORE AND MORE HER DINNER INVITATIONS WERE FROM THE OLDER CROWD LIKE NATALIE SPENCER'S STUPID PARTY THE NIGHT BEFORE SO SHE WATCHED GRAHAM AND LISTENED HE WAS A NICE BOY AND A HANDSOME ONE
HIS NEW FOUND MATURITY SEEMED TO BE SLIPPING FROM HIM SOMEHOW HERE AT HOME THEY ALWAYS MANAGED TO MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE A SMALL BOY HONESTLY MOTHER I'D RATHER GO TO FATHER AND TELL HIM ABOUT IT
TO THAT IN WHICH WAS SITUATE THE CONVENT WHERE THEY HAD PARTED WITH SYBIL THIS ONE WAS POPULOUS NOISY AND LIGHTED IT WAS SATURDAY NIGHT THE STREETS WERE THRONGED AN INFINITE POPULATION KEPT SWARMING TO AND FRO
SAYING IN A VOICE WHICH COULD ONLY BE HEARD BY THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM HE ADDRESSED YOU UNDERSTAND I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT MYSELF OF YOUR MORAL RIGHT I BELIEVE ON EVERY PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE THAT MOWBRAY CASTLE IS AS MUCH YOURS
DON'T MOTHER ME SAID THE JOLLY WIDOW WITH A KINDLING EYE GO TO YOUR OWN MOTHER WHO IS DYING IN A BACK CELLAR WITHOUT A WINDER WHILE YOU'VE GOT LODGINGS IN A TWO PAIR DYING SHE'S ONLY DRUNK SAID THE YOUTH
YOUR FATHER NEEDS YOU HE NEEDS ME THE HELL OF A LOT THE BOY MUTTERED BUT HE WENT OVER AND STOOPING DOWN KISSED HER TREMBLING FACE DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME HE SAID LIGHTLY I DON'T THINK WE'VE GOT SPINE ENOUGH TO GET INTO THE MIX UP ANYHOW
THIS LED TO A VERY LONG CONVERSATION IN WHICH HE SUDDENLY SEEMED TO TAKE GREAT INTEREST AT FIRST HE TALKED OF WRITING TO SEE YOUR FATHER AND I OFFERED THAT GERARD SHOULD CALL UPON HIM
THEN HESITATING WHILE A SOFT EXPRESSION CAME OVER HER COUNTENANCE SHE HELD FORTH HER HAND WHICH HE RETAINED FOR A MOMENT AND WITHDREW I WAS WITH HIM MORE THAN AN HOUR CONTINUED MORLEY AT FIRST HE RECOLLECTED NOTHING
HE TOOK DOWN YOUR DIRECTION IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT WRITE TO YOUR FATHER AND GIVE HIM AN APPOINTMENT WHEN OBSERVING THAT IT WAS WESTMINSTER HE SAID THAT HIS CARRIAGE WAS ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND THAT IF NOT INCONVENIENT TO ME
AS THE HOUSE THAT IS BUILT BY THE TENANT ON THE LORD'S LAND BUT CAN WE PROVE IT WE NEVER HAD THE LEGAL EVIDENCE YOU ARE IN ERROR IN SUPPOSING THAT THESE PAPERS WERE OF ANY VITAL CONSEQUENCE MERE MEMORANDA
IS YOURS THAT LIFE OF UNCOMPLAINING TOIL WHEREIN THERE IS SO MUCH OF BEAUTY AND OF GOODNESS THAT BY THE FINE MAXIM OF OUR CHURCH IT IS HELD TO INCLUDE THE FORCE AND EFFICACY OF PRAYER
I NEVER SAID MISSUS CAREY NO I NEVER HEARD A THING LIKE THAT WHAT NOT WHEN YOU CUT UP THE JACKASS AND SOLD IT FOR VEAL CUTLETS MOTHER HOLD YOUR TONGUE MISTER IMPERENCE SAID THE WIDOW IT'S VERY WELL KNOWN YOU'RE NO CHRISTIAN AND WHO'LL BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY
YOU ARE RIGHT SAID MORLEY LOOKING AT HER RATHER KEENLY WE HAVE ALL OF US OPENED OURSELVES TOO UNRESERVEDLY BEFORE THIS ARISTOCRAT I SHOULD HOPE THAT NONE OF US HAVE SAID TO HIM A WORD THAT WE WISH TO BE FORGOTTEN SAID SYBIL
ABOUT THE NEW WAR CONTRACTS OH BUSINESS

AND YET IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO MORROW SAID MORLEY REST ASSURED THIS MAN HAS HIS EYE ON US HE CAN WALK INTO THE GOVERNMENT OFFICES LIKE THEMSELVES AND TELL HIS TALE FOR THOUGH ONE OF THE PSEUDO OPPOSITION THE MOMENT THE PEOPLE MOVE
SHE ADDED IN A LOWER TONE WELL I HAVE LEFT MISTER TRAFFORD'S MILL SAID THE GIRL THAT'S A BAD JOB SAID MISSUS CAREY FOR THOSE TRAFFORDS ARE KIND TO THEIR PEOPLE
AND WE SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE YOU MICK AND JULIA IF YOU ARE NOT ENGAGED CONTINUED THE GIRL AND SHE LOOKED AT HER FRIEND A PRETTY DEMURE GIRL WHO IMMEDIATELY SAID BUT IN A SOMEWHAT FAULTERING TONE OH THAT WE SHALL
HE WAS RATHER BORED NOW AT THE PROSPECT HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED GOING TO THE CLUB TO PLAY BILLIARDS WHICH WAS HIS CUSTOM OF A LATE AFTERNOON HE DROVE RATHER MORE SLOWLY THAN WAS HIS CUSTOM AND SO MISSED MARION'S INVITATION TO GET THERE BEFORE THE CROWD
HE CHOSE TO WEAR A DISGUISE AND CAN HARDLY QUARREL WITH THE FRANKNESS WITH WHICH WE SPOKE OF HIS ORDER OR HIS FAMILY AND FOR THE REST HE HAS NOT BEEN INJURED FROM LEARNING SOMETHING OF THE FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE BY LIVING AMONG THEM
IF YOU WILL TAKE A DISH OF TEA WITH US TO MORROW WE EXPECT SOME FRIENDS I TAKE IT KINDLY SAID MISSUS CAREY AND SO YOU KEEP HOUSE TOGETHER ALL THE CHILDREN KEEP HOUSE IN THESE DAYS TIMES IS CHANGED INDEED
HERS WERE KIND AND CALM AND THIS EGREMONT SAID MORLEY RATHER HURRIEDLY AND ABRUPTLY AND LOOKING ON THE GROUND HOW CAME HE HERE WHEN WE DISCOVERED HIM YESTERDAY YOUR FATHER AND MYSELF AGREED THAT WE SHOULD NOT MENTION TO YOU THE
THE DIMENSIONS OF CASTLE STREET WERE NOT UNWORTHY OF THE METROPOLIS IT TRAVERSED A GREAT PORTION OF THE TOWN AND WAS PROPORTIONATELY WIDE ITS BROAD PAVEMENTS AND ITS BLAZING GAS LIGHTS INDICATED ITS MODERN ORDER AND PROSPERITY
IS THE PRIVILEGE OF THE PEOPLE OF WHOM I AM ONE SAID HATTON BOWING WELL RECOLLECTING THAT HE WAS ADDRESSING THE DAUGHTER OF A CHARTIST DELEGATE BUT IS YOUR LABOUR THEIR LABOUR SAID SYBIL
THEY BROUGHT OR SENT HER TRIBUTE FLOWERS CANDY AND CIGARETS
AND IF WE HAVE YOU WON'T GO PROMISE ME YOU WON'T GO WHEN HE HESITATED SHE RESORTED TO HER OLD METHODS WITH BOTH CLAYTON AND THE BOY SHE WAS DOING ALL SHE COULD TO MAKE THEM HAPPY SHE MADE NO DEMANDS NONE

ALSO HE PROMISED TO BE SOLE HEIR TO A GREAT BUSINESS IF THE WAR ONLY LASTED LONG ENOUGH IMAGINE YOUR KNOWING ALL THOSE THINGS SHE SAID ADMIRINGLY YOU'RE A PARTNER AREN'T YOU HE FLUSHED SLIGHTLY
I'LL NOT TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD DO FOR YOU MY GOOD GERARD YOU WOULD THINK ME FOOLISH BUT I AM ALONE IN THE WORLD AND SEEING YOU AGAIN AND TALKING OF OLD TIMES I REALLY AM SCARCELY FIT FOR BUSINESS

WHAT MAKES HER DRINK BUT TOIL WORKING FROM FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO SEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND FOR THE LIKE OF SUCH AS YOU THAT'S A GOOD ONE SAID THE YOUTH I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MY MOTHER EVER DID FOR ME BUT GIVE ME TREACLE AND LAUDANUM WHEN I WAS A BABBY
I WAS SPEAKING OF IT TO HARRIET LAST NIGHT
SHE WAS A REALLY PATHETIC FIGURE CROUCHED IN HER LOW CHAIR AND SHAKEN WITH TERROR SHE MUST HAVE RATHER A BAD TIME THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS SHE DARED NOT TAKE TO HIS FATHER SHE BROUGHT THEM TO HIM INSTEAD HER SMALL GRIEVANCES
THE FACTIONS BECOME UNITED SYBIL TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIM AND THEN SAID AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO MORROW THAT WE SHOULD CARE FOR THE GOVERNMENT BEING ACQUAINTED WITH IT OR US DO NOT THEY KNOW EVERYTHING DO NOT YOU MEET IN THEIR VERY SIGHT
THE MYSTIFICATION OF WHICH WE HAD BEEN DUPES AND YOU DID WRONG SAID SYBIL THERE IS NO WISDOM LIKE FRANKNESS HAD YOU TOLD ME HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY HE MET AND ADDRESSED ME AND I ONLY RECOGNISED AN ACQUAINTANCE
AND SHE HAD HELPED HIM OUT OF A HOLE JUST NOW ALL RIGHT I PROMISE HE SAID AT LAST BUT YOU'RE WORRYING YOURSELF FOR NOTHING MOTHER SHE WAS QUITE CONTENT THEN CHEERED AT ONCE CONSULTED THE JEWELLED WATCH ON HER DRESSING TABLE
I KEPT THE LIBRARY AS LONG AS I COULD WE CAN SIT ON THE STAIRS IF YOU LIKE WHICH THEY PROCEEDED TO DO QUITE AMIABLY FROM VARIOUS OPEN DOORS CAME SUBDUED VOICES THE AIR WAS PUNGENT WITH TOBACCO SMOKE
WERE NOW SENDING FLOWERS TO THE DEBUTANTES AND CUTTING IN ON THE YOUNGER MEN AT BALLS HER HOUSE WAS STILL A RENDEZVOUS BUT IT WAS FOR COUPLES LIKE THE ONES WHO HAD PREEMPTED THE DRAWING ROOM THE LIBRARY AND THE MUSIC ROOM THAT AFTERNOON
THE CHIEF STREET OF MOWBRAY CALLED CASTLE STREET AFTER THE RUINS OF THE OLD BARONIAL STRONGHOLD IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS AS SIGNIFICANT OF THE PRESENT CIVILIZATION OF THIS COMMUNITY AS THE HAUGHTY KEEP HAD BEEN OF ITS ANCIENT DEPENDENCE
VERY USEFUL NO DOUBT I HOPE I SHALL FIND THEM BUT OF NO VALIDITY IF MONEY WERE THE ONLY DIFFICULTY TRUST ME IT SHOULD NOT BE WANTING I OWE MUCH TO THE MEMORY OF YOUR FATHER MY GOOD GERARD I WOULD FAIN SERVE YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER
THE WINTER WHICH PRECEDED THE ENTRANCE OF THE UNITED STATES INTO THE WAR WAS SOCIALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE IT WAS MARKED BY AN ALMOST FEVERISH GAYETY AS THOUGH HAVING APPARENTLY DETERMINED TO PURSUE A POLICY DICTATED PURELY BY SELF INTEREST
THE FEARFUL CURSE OF THE DRINK AND GAMBLING HELL THE WAIL OF THE UNEMPLOYED
YE DID IT NOT UNTO ME AND WHEN HAVE I PERSONALLY VISITED THE PRISONER OR THE DESPERATE OR THE SINFUL IN ANY WAY THAT HAS ACTUALLY CAUSED ME SUFFERING RATHER I HAVE FOLLOWED THE CONVENTIONAL SOFT HABITS OF MY POSITION
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THE OLD PANG OVER CAMILLA BUT IT PASSED LEAVING HIM AFTERWARDS WHEN FELICIA HAD GONE BACK WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AND A FEELING THAT WAS ALMOST HOPE THAT FELICIA AND STEPHEN WOULD LIKE EACH OTHER AFTER ALL HE SAID LIKE THE SENSIBLE GOOD MAN THAT HE WAS
BUT WAS RESTLESS JUMPING UP TO LOOK OUT TO SEA AND THEN SITTING DOWN AGAIN IT WOULD BE ONLY A FEW MINUTES MORE BEFORE UP HE WOULD JUMP ONCE MORE TO PACE THE DECK OR LEAN AT THE SHIP'S RAIL
THAT THE SAILORS OF THE MIRABELLE HAD RUSHED OUT FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE SHORE TO STAND STIFF AND APPALLED BESIDE HIM A BABBLE OF VOICES BROKE OUT AND ONE BY ONE THE BOATS WERE HASTILY LAUNCHED HEADING BACK TO THE SHIP
MAXWELL'S POSITION AT RAYMOND IS WELL TAKEN WHEN HE INSISTS THAT TO WALK IN THE STEPS OF CHRIST MEANS TO SUFFER WHERE HAS MY SUFFERING COME IN THE PETTY TRIALS AND ANNOYANCES OF MY CLERICAL LIFE ARE NOT WORTH MENTIONING AS SORROWS OR SUFFERINGS
THIS IS A TERRIBLE CITY IN WHICH WE LIVE ITS MISERY ITS SIN ITS SELFISHNESS APPALL MY HEART AND I HAVE STRUGGLED FOR YEARS WITH THE SICKENING DREAD OF THE TIME WHEN I SHOULD BE FORCED TO LEAVE THE PLEASANT LUXURY OF MY OFFICIAL POSITION
RUNNING UP TO THE BRIDGE HE WAS STARTLED AT FIRST AT COMING ON DECK AT THE SUDDEN GREEN SHADE EVERYWHERE THEN LOOKING UP HE SAW THAT TO THEIR VERY PEAKS THE MASTS AND RIGGING OF THE MIRABELLE HAD BEEN HIDDEN WITH PALM FRONDS
STILL IS THERE NO ESCAPE FROM IT EVEN IN THE SLUMS OF CHICAGO FELICIA LAUGHED AGAIN AND THE MAN'S HEART HEAVY THOUGH IT HAD GROWN DURING SEVERAL MONTHS OF VAST SIN BEARING REJOICED TO HEAR IT IT SOUNDED GOOD IT WAS GOOD IT BELONGED TO GOD
GO RIGHT ON MARTHA THIS IS THE BISHOP YOU HAVE HEARD ME SPEAK OF HIM SO OFTEN SIT DOWN THERE AND LET ME GIVE YOU A TASTE OF THE FLESHPOTS OF EGYPT FOR I BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY FASTING SO THEY HAD AN IMPROVISED LUNCH
AND THEN WE SHALL ONE AND ALL ROW ASHORE TO SEE WHAT WE SHALL SEE HE PAUSED AND CHRIS LOOKING UP SAW THAT THE CAPTAIN'S GAZE WAS FIXED ON ZACHARY HEIGH ZACHARY WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT ONLY FAR FROM SLEEPING
ALL THIS AS A TOTAL FACT IN ITS CONTRAST WITH THE EASY COMFORTABLE LIFE I HAVE LIVED FILLS ME MORE AND MORE WITH A SENSE OF MINGLED TERROR AND SELF ACCUSATION I HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF JESUS MANY TIMES LATELY
I HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE I CANNOT ENDURE THIS ANY LONGER I AM NOT CONDEMNING THE CHURCH I LOVE HER
TO GET NEARER THE GREAT PHYSICAL POVERTY AND SPIRITUAL DESTITUTION OF THE MIGHTY CITY THAT THROBBED AROUND THEM HOW COULD THEY DO THIS EXCEPT AS THEY BECAME A PART OF IT AS NEARLY AS ONE MAN CAN BECOME A PART OF ANOTHER'S MISERY
UNLIKE THEMSELVES SO EMPTY OF LIFE SWEAT STARTED OUT ON CHRIS'S FOREHEAD AS HE IMAGINED ZACHARY IN THE HOLD LIGHTING THE FUSE AND HE WONDERED WHERE THE GOOD CAPTAIN AND MISTER FINNEY MIGHT BE HE WONDERED TOO IF HE COULD ROW OVER IN TIME
I HAVE COME TO CONFESS THAT I HAVE NOT YET KEPT MY PROMISE TO WALK IN HIS STEPS IN THE WAY THAT I BELIEVE I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO IF I SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF WHAT IT MEANS TO WALK IN HIS STEPS DOCTOR BRUCE HAD RISEN AND WAS PACING HIS STUDY
THERE'S TOO MUCH OF HEAT IN IT TO BE GOOD FOR UNKIVERED HEADS CHRIS KNEW THE VOICE OF THE SAILOR WAS RIGHT AND WAS ON THE POINT OF JUMPING INTO ONE OF THE DINGHIES WHERE THEY LAY PULLED UP ON THE BEACH FAR OUT ON THE COVE THE DECKS OF THE MIRABELLE WERE DESERTED AND
A VERY GOOD THING FOR ME THE BISHOP SAYS I OUGHT TO BE VERY GRATEFUL I AM I AM VERY HAPPY NOW I LEARNED THE TRADE HOPING SOME TIME TO BE OF USE I AM NIGHT CLERK AT ONE OF THE HOTELS THAT SUNDAY MORNING WHEN YOU TOOK THE PLEDGE AT NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH
I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE BUT CHRIS WATCHING THE DISAPPEARING BACKS OF THE CAPTAIN AND FIRST MATE
NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH NEVER LOST THE IMPULSE OF THAT MOVEMENT STARTED BY DOCTOR BRUCE THOSE WHO WENT WITH HIM IN MAKING THE PROMISE BREATHED INTO THE CHURCH THE VERY BREATH OF DIVINE LIFE AND ARE CONTINUING THAT LIFE GIVING WORK AT THIS PRESENT TIME
IT WOULD SEEM THE CAPTAIN SAID CASUALLY THAT ZACHARY HAS SOMETHING ON HIS MIND MISTER FINNEY JOINED CHRIS AND THE CAPTAIN AT THAT MOMENT AND LOOKING DOWN AT ZACHARY NODDED HIS LONG SAD FACE IN LUGUBRIOUS AGREEMENT
I BEGIN TO SEE WHAT YOUR PLAN IS YOU CAN BE OF INFINITE HELP TO US YOU DON'T REALLY MEAN THAT YOU WILL LIVE HERE AND HELP THESE PEOPLE TO KNOW THE VALUE OF GOOD FOOD INDEED I DO SHE ANSWERED GRAVELY THAT IS MY GOSPEL SHALL I NOT FOLLOW IT
SAID FELICIA WITH A SHOW OF INDIGNATION I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW SIR THAT THOSE THINGS ARE THE BEST COOKED PUREST FOOD PRODUCTS IN THIS WHOLE CITY I DON'T DOUBT IT HE REPLIED HASTILY WHILE HIS EYES TWINKLED STILL THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING' YOU KNOW THE REST
THREE MONTHS HAD GONE BY SINCE THE SUNDAY MORNING WHEN DOCTOR BRUCE CAME INTO HIS PULPIT WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE NEW DISCIPLESHIP THEY WERE THREE MONTHS OF GREAT EXCITEMENT IN NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH
FELT AMAZED AT THE VISION OF A GREATER SOUL THAN HIS OWN THEY SAT UP LATE AND WERE AS EAGER AND EVEN GLAD AS IF THEY WERE PLANNING FOR A TRIP TOGETHER TO SOME RARE LAND OF UNEXPLORED TRAVEL
MEANWHILE NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH WAS EXPERIENCING SOMETHING NEVER KNOWN BEFORE IN ALL ITS HISTORY
NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH PARTED FROM ITS PASTOR WITH REGRET FOR THE MOST PART ALTHOUGH THE REGRET WAS MODIFIED WITH A FEELING OF RELIEF ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO HAD REFUSED TO TAKE THE PLEDGE DOCTOR BRUCE CARRIED WITH HIM THE RESPECT OF MEN WHO ENTANGLED IN BUSINESS IN SUCH A WAY THAT OBEDIENCE TO THE PLEDGE WOULD HAVE RUINED THEM STILL HELD IN THEIR DEEPER BETTER NATURES A GENUINE ADMIRATION FOR COURAGE AND CONSISTENCY
BUT I FEEL THAT I MUST RESIGN MY PLACE AS PASTOR OF NAZARETH CHURCH IN ORDER TO SATISFY MYSELF THAT I AM WALKING AS I OUGHT TO WALK IN HIS STEPS IN THIS ACTION I JUDGE NO OTHER MINISTER AND PASS NO CRITICISM ON OTHERS DISCIPLESHIP
CALVIN YOU KNOW HOW MANY YEARS I HAVE BEEN DOING THE WORK OF MY POSITION AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND CARE OF IT I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT MY LIFE HAS BEEN FREE FROM BURDEN BEARING OR SORROW
FELICIA WANTED TO VISIT THE SETTLEMENT AND WENT BACK WITH HIM SHE WAS AMAZED AT THE RESULTS OF WHAT CONSIDERABLE MONEY AN A GOOD DEAL OF CONSECRATED BRAINS HAD DONE
TO BLOW UP THE MIRABELLE JUST AS THE VENTURE AND ITS CREW CAME NEAR ENOUGH TO SHOOT DOWN THE UNARMED MEN CHRIS RUSHED BACK TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND STOOD THERE HESITATING IN THE POWERFUL SUN HOW COULD HE CHANGE HIMSELF TO A FISH OR OTHER SHAPE UNOBSERVED
SINCE THEN HE SAID AND THEN HE WAS AFRAID HE HAD WOUNDED HER OR CALLED UP PAINFUL MEMORIES BUT SHE HAD LIVED OVER ALL THAT YES AND YOU ALSO HOW IS IT THAT YOU'RE WORKING HERE IT IS A LONG STORY MISS STERLING MY FATHER LOST HIS MONEY AND I WAS OBLIGED TO GO TO WORK
IF WE WERE TO RESIGN OUR CHARGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GOING TO BOMBAY OR HONG KONG OR ANY PLACE IN AFRICA THE CHURCHES AND THE PEOPLE WOULD EXCLAIM AT THE HEROISM OF MISSIONS
THE BISHOP HAD RISEN NOW AND WALKED OVER TO THE WINDOW THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WAS AS LIGHT AS DAY AND HE LOOKED OUT AT THE CROWDS PASSING THEN TURNED AND WITH A PASSIONATE UTTERANCE THAT SHOWED HOW DEEP THE VOLCANIC FIRE IN HIM BURNED HE EXCLAIMED CALVIN
THE BISHOP'S FACE GREW IN GLORY NOW EVERY DAY MY PLAN REPLIED DOCTOR BRUCE SLOWLY IS IN BRIEF THE PUTTING OF MYSELF INTO THE CENTRE OF THE GREATEST HUMAN NEED I CAN FIND IN THIS CITY AND LIVING THERE
HIS FINE FACE ACTUALLY GLOWED WITH THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE MOVEMENT IN WHICH HE AND HIS FRIEND WERE INEVITABLY EMBARKED HE WENT ON AND UNFOLDED A PLAN OF SUCH FAR REACHING POWER AND POSSIBILITY THAT DOCTOR BRUCE CAPABLE AND EXPERIENCED AS HE WAS
BUT I CANNOT SAY THAT I HAVE SUFFERED ANY FOR JESUS THAT VERSE IN PETER CONSTANTLY HAUNTS ME CHRIST ALSO SUFFERED FOR YOU LEAVING YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT YE SHOULD FOLLOW HIS STEPS I HAVE LIVED IN LUXURY I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO WANT
I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO ABROAD AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND HAVE ENJOYED FOR YEARS THE BEAUTIFUL COMPANIONSHIP OF ART AND LETTERS AND MUSIC AND ALL THE REST OF THE VERY BEST I HAVE NEVER KNOWN WHAT IT MEANT TO BE WITHOUT MONEY OR ITS EQUIVALENT
AND I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SILENCE THE QUESTION OF LATE WHAT HAVE I SUFFERED FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST PAUL WAS TOLD WHAT GREAT THINGS HE MUST SUFFER FOR THE SAKE OF HIS LORD
WHERE WAS THE SUFFERING TO COME IN UNLESS THERE WAS AN ACTUAL SELF DENIAL OF SOME SORT
DOCTOR BRUCE WAS VERY PALE NEVER HAD HE SEEN THE BISHOP OR HEARD HIM WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH A PASSION THERE WAS A SUDDEN SILENCE IN THE ROOM THE BISHOP SAT DOWN AGAIN AND BOWED HIS HEAD DOCTOR BRUCE SPOKE AT LAST EDWARD
IT WAS A SMALL BUT WELL EQUIPPED CARPENTER'S SHOP A YOUNG MAN WITH A PAPER CAP ON HIS HEAD AND CLAD IN BLOUSE AND OVERALLS WAS WHISTLING AND DRIVING THE PLANE AS HE WHISTLED HE LOOKED UP AS THE TWO ENTERED AND TOOK OFF HIS CAP AS HE DID SO HIS LITTLE FINGER CARRIED A SMALL CURLING SHAVING UP TO HIS HAIR AND IT CAUGHT THERE
DUTIES OVER FOR THAT DAY TUMBLING DOWN THE LADDERS TO THE DINGHIES IN WHICH THEY ROWED ASHORE CHRIS AND AMOS WERE SHOVED ALONG WITH THEIR FRIENDS CHRIS HIKING UP HIS BREECHES TO COVER THE COIL OF THE MAGIC ROPE AROUND HIS WAIST THE LEATHERN BAG HANGING IN PLAIN SIGHT ABOUT HIS NECK
IT IS AS OLD AS BETHLEHEM AND NAZARETH AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS THE NEAREST APPROACH TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD SATISFY THE HUNGER OF THESE TWO MEN TO SUFFER FOR CHRIST THERE HAD SPRUNG UP IN THEM AT THE SAME TIME A LONGING THAT AMOUNTED TO A PASSION
THE BISHOP REPLIED TO ONE VALUED FRIEND WHO HAD ALMOST WITH TEARS TRIED TO DISSUADE HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE WHY SHOULD WHAT DOCTOR BRUCE AND I PROPOSE TO DO SEEM SO REMARKABLE A THING AS IF IT WERE UNHEARD OF THAT A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY AND A BISHOP SHOULD WANT TO SAVE LOST SOULS IN THIS PARTICULAR MANNER
LEAVE THE LADS NO SIGHT FOR YOUNG UNS PULL YOU LAZY LUBBERS
NO DOUBT NEITHER MISTER FINNEY NOR I
HE PAUSED AGAIN BUT THERE WAS NOT A STIR FROM HIS AUDIENCE
IS NOT ROMANCE A PART OF HUMANITY LOVE IS OLDER THAN I AM AND WISER THE WEEK FOLLOWING THE BISHOP HAD AN EXPERIENCE THAT BELONGS TO THIS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT HISTORY
HE HUMBLY CONFESSED THAT THE APPEAL HE HAD MADE MET WITH AN UNEXPECTED RESPONSE FROM MEN AND WOMEN WHO LIKE FELICIA WERE HUNGRY FOR SOMETHING IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE CONVENTIONAL TYPE OF CHURCH MEMBERSHIP AND FELLOWSHIP HAD FAILED TO GIVE THEM
COME IN AND TRY SOME SHE EXCLAIMED YOU POOR BISHOP YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HADN'T HAD A GOOD MEAL FOR A MONTH
I BELIEVE IN HER MISSION AND HAVE NO DESIRE TO DESTROY LEAST OF ALL IN THE STEP I AM ABOUT TO TAKE DO I DESIRE TO BE CHARGED WITH ABANDONING THE CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP
WE WERE ALL TO GO ASHORE PRESENTLY IN ANY CASE THOSE WHO STILL WANT TO SLEEP CAN DO SO EVEN MORE COMFORTABLY ON THE SHADY SAND UNDER THE PALMS SO IN AN INSTANT THE DECKS OF THE MIRABELLE WERE CROWDED WITH LAUGHING JOSTLING MEN
I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED OF LATE TO LASH MYSELF WITH A SCOURGE
AND WHEN HE REACHED THE BRIDGE HE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE FRUITS FROM THE ISLAND PILED IN SHADY CORNERS THESE AND BREAD AND CHEESE MADE UP HIS MEAL WHICH HE ATE WHILE WATCHING THE FINAL LEAVES AND FRONDS PUT IN PLACE ON THE SIDES OF THE MIRABELLE
WHY SHOULD IT SEEM SO GREAT A THING IF WE HAVE BEEN LED TO GIVE OUR LIVES TO HELP RESCUE THE HEATHEN AND THE LOST OF OUR OWN CITY IN THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO TRY IT
AND HAVE LIVED IN THE SOCIETY OF THE RICH REFINED ARISTOCRATIC MEMBERS OF MY CONGREGATIONS WHERE HAS THE SUFFERING COME IN WHAT HAVE I SUFFERED FOR JESUS SAKE DO YOU KNOW CALVIN HE TURNED ABRUPTLY TOWARD HIS FRIEND
IT WAS NOT A NEW IDEA IT WAS AN IDEA STARTED BY JESUS CHRIST WHEN HE LEFT HIS FATHER'S HOUSE
NED HAD COME FROM HIS REST WITH A SMALL COMPANY OF THE SAILORS TO ASK PERMISSION OF THE CAPTAIN IF THEY MIGHT LEAVE THE SHIP WELL WHY NOT THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED AND WHY NOT TAKE ALONG THE REST TOO
ALTHOUGH TO SPEAK TRUTH FOR HIM HE HAD NO DESIRE TO GO BACK TO IT WELL DEAR BISHOP SAID FELICIA WHO HAD ALWAYS CALLED HIM SO I KNEW HOW OVERWHELMED YOU WERE WITH YOUR WORK
COMPARED WITH PAUL OR ANY OF THE CHRISTIAN MARTYRS OR EARLY DISCIPLES I HAVE LIVED A LUXURIOUS SINFUL LIFE FULL OF EASE AND PLEASURE I CANNOT ENDURE THIS ANY LONGER I HAVE THAT WITHIN ME WHICH OF LATE RISES IN OVERWHELMING CONDEMNATION OF SUCH A FOLLOWING OF JESUS
CHRISTIAN AMERICA IS IT A REPROACH ON THE FORM OF OUR DISCIPLESHIP THAT THE EXHIBITION OF ACTUAL SUFFERING FOR JESUS ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO WALK IN HIS STEPS ALWAYS PROVOKES ASTONISHMENT AS AT THE SIGHT OF SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL
THEIR PLAN AS IT FINALLY GREW INTO A WORKABLE FACT WAS IN REALITY NOTHING MORE THAN THE RENTING OF A LARGE BUILDING FORMERLY USED AS A WAREHOUSE FOR A BREWERY
HE HAD WALKED ABOUT FOUR BLOCKS WHEN HE WAS ATTRACTED BY A SHOP THAT LOOKED DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS STILL QUITE NEW TO HIM AND EVERY DAY HE DISCOVERED SOME STRANGE SPOT OR STUMBLED UPON SOME UNEXPECTED HUMANITY
THE BISHOP REMAINED IN THE DEEP EASY CHAIR WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED BUT HIS EYE BURNED WITH THE BLOW THAT BELONGED TO HIM BEFORE HE MADE SOME GREAT RESOLVE EDWARD DOCTOR BRUCE SPOKE ABRUPTLY I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO SATISFY MYSELF EITHER IN OBEYING MY PROMISE
IT WAS FALL AGAIN AND THE CITY FACED ANOTHER HARD WINTER THE BISHOP ONE AFTERNOON CAME OUT OF THE SETTLEMENT AND WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK INTENDING TO GO ON A VISIT TO ONE OF HIS NEW FRIENDS IN THE DISTRICT
BUT I FEEL AS YOU DO INTO A CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE SIN AND SHAME AND DEGRADATION OF THIS GREAT CITY I MUST COME PERSONALLY AND I KNOW THAT TO DO THAT I MUST SEVER MY IMMEDIATE CONNECTION WITH NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH
BUT WHY HAVE YOU DARED TO COME TO CHICAGO WITHOUT TELLING ME AND HOW HAVE YOU ENTERED MY DIOCESE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE ASKED THE BISHOP AND FELICIA LOOKED SO LIKE THAT BEAUTIFUL CLEAN EDUCATED REFINED WORLD HE ONCE KNEW THAT HE MIGHT BE PARDONED FOR SEEING IN HER SOMETHING OF THE OLD PARADISE
TO PUT MY LIFE INTO CONTACT WITH THE MODERN PAGANISM OF THIS CENTURY THE AWFUL CONDITION OF THE GIRLS IN SOME GREAT BUSINESS PLACES THE BRUTAL SELFISHNESS OF THE INSOLENT SOCIETY FASHION AND WEALTH THAT IGNORES ALL THE SORROW OF THE CITY
MISS STERLING MISTER STEPHEN CLYDE SAID THE BISHOP
THEY HAD BOTH REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION BY THE SAME REASONING AND THEY WERE TOO THOUGHTFUL TOO WELL ACCUSTOMED TO THE MEASURING OF CONDUCT TO UNDERESTIMATE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR POSITION WHAT IS YOUR PLAN THE BISHOP AT LAST SPOKE GENTLY LOOKING WITH THE SMILE THAT ALWAYS BEAUTIFIED HIS FACE
TERRIFIED AND DESPAIRING AND OUT OVER THE WATER FOLLOWING IT CAME A LOW SCATTERED RUMBLE SILENCE FELL FOR SEVERAL FROZEN SECONDS AND THEN ALL AT ONCE CHRIS BECAME AWARE AS HE STOOD RIGID WITH HORROR BY THE BOAT
FEELING AS I DO FOR MY SHIP AND MY MEN I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO READ THE HOLY WORDS OVER THIS MAN
LEAVING CHRIS SHAKING AND UNNERVED ON THE SAND OVER THE WATER AS BRAWNY BACKS BENT TO THE OARS THE WORDS CAME FLOATING BACK
NODDING HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRESS HIS WORDS YET HE SAID
HIS BARE CHEST AND SHOULDERS WERE TANNED AND HEALTHY
CAME A PROLONGED AND PIERCING SCREAM HOT AS HE WAS CHRIS FELT HIMSELF GO COLD AT THE SOUND HE KNEW INSTANTLY ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE THAT THIS WAS THE DEATH CRY OF A MAN THE SCREAM CAME A SECOND TIME
OR WHAT LED TO THE MOVEMENT HE FINALLY MADE TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF ALL WHO KNEW HIM BETTER THAN BY RELATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN HIM AND THE BISHOP AT THIS TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE PLEDGE IN NAZARETH AVENUE CHURCH THE TWO FRIENDS WERE AS BEFORE IN DOCTOR BRUCE'S HOUSE SEATED IN HIS STUDY
IT IS NOT PROPER THAT HE SHOULD BE LEFT WITHOUT EVEN A TOKEN OF RESPECT HE GESTURED WITH HIS PLUMP HAND TO THE BIBLE DO YOU SETTLE AMONG YOURSELVES WHO SHALL DO THE READING
RESOLUTION AND ANGER STILL EVIDENT EVEN IN THE SET OF THEIR SHOULDERS THE BOY WAS THOUGHTFUL THINKING BACK OVER WHAT NED HAD SAID OF THEM THAT FIRST DAY ON THE DOCKS FAITHFUL
YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE COME IN THIS EVENING FOR THE BISHOP WAS SAYING AFTER THE FRIENDS HAD BEEN TALKING SOME TIME ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THE PLEDGE WITH THE NAZARETH AVENUE PEOPLE DOCTOR BRUCE LOOKED OVER AT THE BISHOP AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
THE PLACE THAT ATTRACTED HIS NOTICE WAS A SMALL HOUSE CLOSE BY A CHINESE LAUNDRY THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS IN THE FRONT VERY CLEAN AND THAT WAS REMARKABLE TO BEGIN WITH THEN INSIDE THE WINDOW WAS A TEMPTING DISPLAY OF COOKERY
BY THE STRENGTH OF THE SUN AND THE HEAT THAT SEEPED EVEN THROUGH THE BOARDS OF THE SHIP CHRIS JUDGED THAT THE MORNING WAS WELL ADVANCED DRESSING WAS RAPID FOR CHRIS LIKE THE REST OF THE SAILORS IN THE TROPIC HEAT WORE ONLY HIS BREECHES
AS THEY WALKED THROUGH THE BUILDING THEY TALKED INCESSANTLY SHE WAS THE INCARNATION OF VITAL ENTHUSIASM AND HE WONDERED AT THE EXHIBITION OF IT AS IT BUBBLED UP AND SPARKLED OVER THEY WENT DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT AND THE BISHOP PUSHED OPEN A DOOR FROM BEHIND WHICH CAME THE SOUND OF A CARPENTER'S PLANE
I DO NOT NEED TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSED MY FEELINGS ALSO I HAVE BEEN IN A SIMILAR POSITION FOR YEARS MY LIFE HAS BEEN ONE OF COMPARATIVE LUXURY I DO NOT OF COURSE MEAN TO SAY THAT I HAVE NOT HAD TRIALS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS AND BURDENS IN MY CHURCH MINISTRY
AND LED HIM INTO THE SHADE AND OF HOW SICK HE WAS THE HEAT AND THE SCREAM THE FEAR AND A SENSE OF HAVING FAILED IN WARNING THE CAPTAIN COMBINING TO CHURN HIS INSIDES INTO A QUEASY PLACE THAT VIOLENTLY REJECTED HIS PLEASANT BREAKFAST OF SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
AND UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE AND THE MINISTER AS A LUXURIOUS IDLER ALL THE VAST TUMULT OF THIS VAST TORRENT OF HUMANITY WITH ITS FALSE AND ITS TRUE IDEAS ITS EXAGGERATION OF EVILS IN THE CHURCH AND ITS BITTERNESS AND SHAME THAT ARE THE RESULT OF MANY COMPLEX CAUSES
WITH PRICES ATTACHED TO THE VARIOUS ARTICLES THAT MADE HIM WONDER SOMEWHAT FOR HE WAS FAMILIAR BY THIS TIME WITH MANY FACTS IN THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE ONCE UNKNOWN TO HIM AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT THE WINDOWS THE DOOR BETWEEN THEM OPENED AND FELICIA STERLING CAME OUT FELICIA EXCLAIMED THE BISHOP
I DO NOT SEE ANY OTHER WAY FOR MYSELF TO SUFFER FOR HIS SAKE AS I FEEL THAT I OUGHT TO SUFFER AGAIN THAT SUDDEN SILENCE FELL OVER THOSE TWO MEN IT WAS NO ORDINARY ACTION THEY WERE DECIDING
RECONSTRUCTING IT AND LIVING IN IT THEMSELVES IN THE VERY HEART OF A TERRITORY WHERE THE SALOON RULED WITH POWER WHERE THE TENEMENT WAS ITS FILTHIEST WHERE VICE AND IGNORANCE AND SHAME AND POVERTY WERE CONGESTED INTO HIDEOUS FORMS
BUT WHEN IT BECOME PUBLICLY KNOWN THAT THE BISHOP HAD ALSO ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION AND RETIREMENT FROM THE POSITION HE HAD HELD SO LONG IN ORDER TO GO AND LIVE HIMSELF IN THE CENTRE OF THE WORST PART OF CHICAGO THE PUBLIC ASTONISHMENT REACHED ITS HEIGHT BUT WHY
I HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED BY THE SOFT EASY COMFORTS OF CIVILIZATION THE SIN AND MISERY OF THIS GREAT CITY HAVE BEATEN LIKE WAVES AGAINST THE STONE WALLS OF MY CHURCH AND OF THIS HOUSE IN WHICH I LIVE AND I HAVE HARDLY HEEDED THEM THE WALLS HAVE BEEN SO THICK
IS LAW FOR ELISHA FINNEY AND CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
ONE OF THE MEN THRUST A PISTOL IN HIS FACE AND THE OTHER THREATENED HIM WITH A RAGGED STAKE THAT HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN TORN FROM THE FENCE
I AM AN EXPERT AND I HAVE A PLAN I WANT YOU TO ADMIRE AND DEVELOP WILL YOU DEAR BISHOP INDEED I WILL HE REPLIED THE SIGHT OF FELICIA AND HER REMARKABLE VITALITY ENTHUSIASM AND EVIDENT PURPOSE ALMOST BEWILDERED HIM
AS GOOD AS THE AUDITORIUM BANQUETS WERE SIMPLY HUSKS COMPARED WITH THIS ONE FELICIA BUT YOU MUST COME TO THE SETTLEMENT I WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING AND I AM SIMPLY ASTONISHED TO FIND YOU HERE EARNING YOUR LIVING THIS WAY
OR STRAGGLY UNKEMPT HAIR THE MEN WHO KNEW NO OTHER LIFE BUT THE SEA NO HAPPINESS OR DANGER UNCONNECTED WITH IT NEVER TOOK THEIR EYES FROM THEIR CAPTAIN SO MEN CAPTAIN BLIZZARD RESUMED
AND HOWEVER THE BISHOP MAY HAVE SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE NOTHING SO REMARKABLE ABOUT IT AT ALL THE PUBLIC CONTINUED TO TALK AND THE CHURCHES TO RECORD THEIR ASTONISHMENT THAT TWO SUCH MEN SO PROMINENT IN THE MINISTRY SHOULD LEAVE THEIR COMFORTABLE HOMES VOLUNTARILY RESIGN THEIR PLEASANT SOCIAL POSITIONS AND ENTER UPON A LIFE OF HARDSHIP OF SELF DENIAL AND ACTUAL SUFFERING
IS IT THEN SUCH A TREMENDOUS EVENT THAT TWO CHRISTIAN MINISTERS SHOULD BE NOT ONLY WILLING BUT EAGER TO LIVE CLOSE TO THE MISERY OF THE WORLD IN ORDER TO KNOW IT AND REALIZE IT IS IT SUCH A RARE THING THAT LOVE OF HUMANITY SHOULD FIND THIS PARTICULAR FORM OF EXPRESSION IN THE RESCUE OF SOULS
HE WAS COMING BACK TO THE SETTLEMENT VERY LATE FROM SOME GATHERING OF THE STRIKING TAILORS AND WAS WALKING ALONG WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM WHEN TWO MEN JUMPED OUT FROM BEHIND AN OLD FENCE THAT SHUT OFF AN ABANDONED FACTORY FROM THE STREET AND FACED HIM
CHRIS OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SAY SOMETHING TO THE CAPTAIN OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN ZACHARY DOING BEFORE THE WORDS COULD LEAVE HIS MOUTH HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE APPEARANCE OF RED FACED NED CILLEY CHEERFUL AS A SAND FLEA AT THE PROSPECT OF GOING ASHORE
CHRIS SEARCHED AND SEARCHED AGAIN FOR THREE FACES AMONG THE CROWD THAT HE DID NOT FIND ZACHARY HEIGH THE CAPTAIN AND MISTER FINNEY WERE NOT TO BE FOUND AGHAST AS HE UNDERSTOOD NOW WHAT ZACHARY'S PLAN WAS
WHEN DID YOU MOVE INTO MY PARISH WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE HOW DID YOU FIND ME SO SOON INQUIRED FELICIA WHY DON'T YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE ONLY CLEAN WINDOWS IN THE BLOCK I BELIEVE THEY ARE REPLIED FELICIA WITH A LAUGH THAT DID THE BISHOP GOOD TO HEAR
MY WIFE IS FULLY IN ACCORD WITH ME WE HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO FIND A RESIDENCE IN THAT PART OF THE CITY WHERE WE CAN MAKE OUR PERSONAL LIVES COUNT FOR THE MOST LET ME SUGGEST A PLACE THE BISHOP WAS ON FIRE NOW
THAT SIDE OF THE SHIP THAT COULD BE SEEN FROM THE SEA THROUGH THE NARROW CHANNEL ENTRANCE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY COVERED WITH GREEN THE WORK WAS NOT YET FINISHED BUT MOST OF THE CREW WERE SLEEPING DURING THE HOT HOURS
WE HAVE MET BEFORE SAID FELICIA LOOKING AT CLYDE FRANKLY YES BACK IN THE WORLD AS THE BISHOP SAYS REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS FINGERS TREMBLED A LITTLE AS THEY LAY ON THE BOARD HE HAD BEEN PLANING YES FELICIA HESITATED I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU
WAS THINKING WHAT A CURIOUS AND FORTUNATE THING IT WAS THAT THE BALES HAD FALLEN ON ZACHARY JUST AT THE RIGHT TIME AND WHEN THERE WAS NOT A RIPPLE ON THE COVE CHRIS WATCHED THE FAT SHORT MAN AND THE TALL LEAN ONE GO
CAPTAIN BLIZZARD CAME UP TO HIM HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIS BACK AND NODDED TOWARD THE MEN PULLING THEMSELVES SLOWLY OVER THE SHIP'S SIDE AND FALLING EXHAUSTED INTO THE SHADE TO SLEEP FOR A FEW HOURS
THEY HAD KNOWN DOCTOR BRUCE MANY YEARS AS A KINDLY CONSERVATIVE SAFE MAN BUT THE THOUGHT OF HIM IN THE LIGHT OF SACRIFICE OF THIS SORT WAS NOT FAMILIAR TO THEM AS FAST AS THEY UNDERSTOOD IT THEY GAVE THEIR PASTOR THE CREDIT OF BEING ABSOLUTELY TRUE TO HIS RECENT CONVICTIONS AS TO WHAT FOLLOWING JESUS MEANT
THE SAILORS FROM THE MIRABELLE WERE EVERYWHERE IN THE THICKETS FOR THE SHADE AS WELL AS ALONG THE EDGE OF THE COVE WHERE HE NOW STOOD INDECISIVE TO USE THE ROPE WAS JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE BEACH WAS BROAD AND CHRIS WAS ACUTELY AWARE THAT HE STOOD OUT LIKE A SINGLE TREE IN A FIELD
I'M ABLE TO EARN MY OWN LIVING NOW YOU ARE THE BISHOP SAID A LITTLE INCREDULOUSLY HOW MAKING THOSE THINGS THOSE THINGS
ONLY THIS CHURCH WAS FAR MORE ARISTOCRATIC WEALTHY AND CONVENTIONAL
OR IF HE WOULD BE BLOWN UP WITH THE SHIP THE BOY HAD HIS HANDS ON THE SCORCHING WOOD OF A DINGHY HIS MUSCLES TENSED TO THRUST IT INTO THE WATERS OF THE COVE WHEN OUT OVER THE STILL HARBOR JANGLING IN THE HEAT
HAD NOT THE BUNG OF THAT KEG OF MOLASSES ABOVE THE LIGHTED FUSE
AND WHAT WAS TO MAKE THAT SELF DENIAL APPARENT TO THEMSELVES OR ANY ONE ELSE UNLESS IT TOOK THIS CONCRETE ACTUAL PERSONAL FORM OF TRYING TO SHARE THE DEEPEST SUFFERING AND SIN OF THE CITY
INDEED THE BISHOP SAID MANY TIMES AFTERWARD THAT THE MOMENT HIS DECISION WAS REACHED TO LIVE THE LIFE OF PERSONAL SACRIFICE HE HAD CHOSEN HE SUDDENLY FELT AN UPLIFTING AS IF A GREAT BURDEN WERE TAKEN FROM HIM HE WAS EXULTANT SO WAS DOCTOR BRUCE FROM THE SAME CAUSE
ARE YOU THE FLUSH OF PLEASURE MOUNTED TO THE YOUNG CARPENTER'S FOREHEAD
THAT MET HIS DEATH BY ACCIDENT BOXES AND CRATES KILLING HIM IN THE HOLD THE WAY THEY DID BUT AND THE CAPTAIN SCANNED THE TOUGH WEATHER BEATEN FACES NEAR HIM SLOWLY ONE BY ONE
THE GUNPOWDER THAT WAS MEANT TO BE THE END OF OUR FINE SHIP IS NOW SAFE AND OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND THE TRAITOR WHO INTENDED THIS INFAMOUS DEED HAS BEEN DEALT WITH BY FATE AND KILLED IN A TOMB OF HIS OWN FINDING THEREFORE
AND THE BISHOP WHO TO TELL THE TRUTH HAD NOT TAKEN TIME FOR WEEKS TO ENJOY HIS MEALS FEASTED ON THE DELIGHT OF HIS UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY AND WAS ABLE TO EXPRESS HIS ASTONISHMENT AND GRATIFICATION AT THE QUALITY OF THE COOKERY
BUT WHY SHOULD I GO BUT DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE PREPARING TROUBLE FOR YOURSELF SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH FINDING HIS CAP AND GETTING UP HOW SO DO YOU SUPPOSE I DON'T SEE THE LINE YOU'VE TAKEN UP WITH YOUR WIFE
AND ARRANGED HIS WIFE'S LIFE SO THAT SHE DID NOTHING AND COULD DO NOTHING BUT SHARE HER HUSBAND'S EFFORTS THAT HER TIME SHOULD PASS AS HAPPILY AND AS AGREEABLY AS POSSIBLE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN A CHARACTERISTIC OF LEVIN'S TO PUT THE MOST FAVORABLE INTERPRETATION ON PEOPLE
SUCH AS BANKING FOR INSTANCE HE WENT ON IT'S AN EVIL THE AMASSING OF HUGE FORTUNES WITHOUT LABOR JUST THE SAME THING AS WITH THE SPIRIT MONOPOLIES IT'S ONLY THE FORM THAT'S CHANGED
AND WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP UP A CONVERSATION WITH HER AND HER SISTER WHO WAS SITTING OPPOSITE HIM MADAME SVIAZHSKAYA WAS A ROUND FACED FAIR HAIRED RATHER SHORT WOMAN ALL SMILES AND DIMPLES LEVIN TRIED THROUGH HER
MALTHUS WAS A WELL KNOWN CAPITALIST WHO HAD MADE HIS MONEY BY SPECULATION IN RAILWAY SHARES STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH DESCRIBED WHAT GROUSE MOORS THIS MALTHUS HAD BOUGHT IN THE TVER PROVINCE
WELL I SHALL GO BY MYSELF SAID VESLOVSKY GETTING UP EAGERLY AND PUTTING ON HIS SHOES AND STOCKINGS GOOD BYE GENTLEMEN IF IT'S FUN I'LL FETCH YOU YOU'VE TREATED ME TO SOME GOOD SPORT AND I WON'T FORGET YOU
AND THE VODKA I NEVER TASTED ANY BETTER AND THEY WOULD NOT TAKE A PENNY FOR ANYTHING AND THEY KEPT SAYING
HE HAS HIS MASCULINE INTERESTS A MAN HAS TO BE MANLY SAID OBLONSKY OPENING THE DOOR IN WHAT WAY TO GO RUNNING AFTER SERVANT GIRLS SAID LEVIN WHY NOT IF IT AMUSES HIM
AS TO WHICH WAS ORDERING HIS LIFE BEST AND NOW THIS HOSTILITY SHOWED ITSELF IN THE CONVERSATION AS IT BEGAN TO TAKE A PERSONAL NOTE I DON'T GIVE IT AWAY BECAUSE NO ONE DEMANDS THAT FROM ME AND IF I WANTED TO
FOR A LONG WHILE LEVIN COULD NOT GET TO SLEEP HE HEARD THE HORSES MUNCHING HAY THEN HE HEARD THE PEASANT AND HIS ELDER BOY GETTING READY FOR THE NIGHT AND GOING OFF FOR THE NIGHT WATCH WITH THE BEASTS
IT'S JUST THIS MY DEAR BOY ONE MUST DO ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER ADMIT THAT THE EXISTING ORDER OF SOCIETY IS JUST AND THEN STICK UP FOR ONE'S RIGHTS IN IT
AND HE WAS EXPRESSING HIS SATISFACTION WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR HIM LEVIN PRETENDED TO BE ASLEEP WHILE OBLONSKY PUTTING ON HIS SLIPPERS AND LIGHTING A CIGAR WALKED OUT OF THE BARN AND SOON THEIR VOICES WERE LOST
SPECIALLY PUT ON AS HE FANCIED FOR HIS BENEFIT CUT PARTICULARLY OPEN IN THE SHAPE OF A TRAPEZE ON HER WHITE BOSOM THIS QUADRANGULAR OPENING IN SPITE OF THE BOSOM'S BEING VERY WHITE OR JUST BECAUSE IT WAS VERY WHITE
AND I'LL MAKE A POINT OF KEEPING COOL THERE ARE LOTS OF SNIPE AND THERE ARE GROUSE TOO WHEN I COME BACK THERE'LL BE THE NOTE FROM KITTY YES STIVA MAY BE RIGHT I'M NOT MANLY WITH HER I'M TIED TO HER APRON STRINGS
LEVIN DID NOT ANSWER WHAT THEY HAD SAID IN THE CONVERSATION THAT HE ACTED JUSTLY ONLY IN A NEGATIVE SENSE ABSORBED HIS THOUGHTS CAN IT BE THAT IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO BE JUST NEGATIVELY HE WAS ASKING HIMSELF
GIVE IT TO THIS PEASANT HE WOULD NOT REFUSE IT YES BUT HOW AM I TO GIVE IT UP AM I TO GO TO HIM AND MAKE A DEED OF CONVEYANCE
AND HE KNEW TOO THAT ALTHOUGH HE WANTED TO GET MARRIED AND ALTHOUGH BY EVERY TOKEN THIS VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT WIFE HE COULD NO MORE HAVE MARRIED HER EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN IN LOVE WITH KITTY SHTCHERBATSKAYA THAN HE COULD HAVE FLOWN UP TO THE SKY
AND BANKING COMPANIES THAT TOO IS PROFIT WITHOUT WORK YES THAT MAY ALL BE VERY TRUE AND CLEVER LIE DOWN KRAK STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH CALLED TO HIS DOG
THE BEST TYPE OF MAN TAKING PART IN LOCAL AFFAIRS THAT LEVIN KNEW WAS VERY INTERESTING TO HIM SVIAZHSKY WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ALWAYS A SOURCE OF WONDER TO LEVIN WHOSE CONVICTIONS VERY LOGICAL THOUGH NEVER ORIGINAL GO ONE WAY BY THEMSELVES
IT WON'T DO MY WIFE ANY HARM AND IT'LL AMUSE ME THE GREAT THING IS TO RESPECT THE SANCTITY OF THE HOME THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING IN THE HOME BUT DON'T TIE YOUR OWN HANDS
BUT WE HAVE A FIRST RATE SCHOOLMISTRESS NOW AND WE'VE STARTED GYMNASTIC EXERCISES NO THANK YOU I WON'T HAVE ANY MORE TEA SAID LEVIN AND CONSCIOUS OF DOING A RUDE THING BUT INCAPABLE OF CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION
BRIGHTLY LIGHTED UP BY THE MOONLIGHT THEY WERE STANDING TALKING STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS SAYING SOMETHING OF THE FRESHNESS OF ONE GIRL COMPARING HER TO A FRESHLY PEELED NUT
THE BROTHER OF THE PEASANT'S WIFE
HE REALLY IS A CAPITAL FELLOW ISN'T HE SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WHEN VESLOVSKY HAD GONE OUT AND THE PEASANT HAD CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HIM YES CAPITAL ANSWERED LEVIN STILL THINKING OF THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION JUST BEFORE
BUT HE FELT THAT HE WAS TO BLAME FOR THE VERY FACT OF THE LOW NECKED BODICE HAVING BEEN MADE IT SEEMED TO LEVIN THAT HE HAD DECEIVED SOMEONE THAT HE OUGHT TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING BUT THAT TO EXPLAIN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
HE GOT UP BLUSHING I HEAR A VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION HE ADDED AND WALKED TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE WHERE SVIAZHSKY WAS SITTING WITH THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD SVIAZHSKY WAS SITTING SIDEWAYS WITH ONE ELBOW ON THE TABLE
THE PARTY DRANK THEIR TEA AND ATE THEIR SUPPER WITH A RELISH ONLY KNOWN TO SPORTSMEN WASHED AND CLEAN THEY WENT INTO A HAY BARN SWEPT READY FOR THEM WHERE THE COACHMAN HAD BEEN MAKING UP BEDS FOR THE GENTLEMEN
INTENTIONALLY AS IT SEEMED PROVOKING LEVIN THERE HAD ARISEN OF LATE SOMETHING LIKE A SECRET ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS IN LAW AS THOUGH SINCE THEY HAD MARRIED SISTERS A KIND OF RIVALRY HAD SPRUNG UP BETWEEN THEM
WHEN LEVIN AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH REACHED THE PEASANT'S HUT WHERE LEVIN ALWAYS USED TO STAY VESLOVSKY WAS ALREADY THERE HE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HUT CLINGING WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE BENCH FROM WHICH HE WAS BEING PULLED BY A SOLDIER
AND FOR THAT REASON HE WAS CONTINUALLY BLUSHING WAS ILL AT EASE AND AWKWARD HIS AWKWARDNESS INFECTED THE PRETTY SISTER IN LAW TOO BUT THEIR HOSTESS APPEARED NOT TO OBSERVE THIS AND KEPT PURPOSELY DRAWING HER INTO THE CONVERSATION
TWO LANDOWNERS WHO HAD COME ABOUT SOME BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH A WARDSHIP WERE OF THE PARTY AND THE INTERESTING CONVERSATION LEVIN HAD BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO SPRANG UP LEVIN WAS SITTING BESIDE HIS HOSTESS AT THE TEA TABLE
TO GET A SOLUTION OF THE WEIGHTY ENIGMA HER HUSBAND PRESENTED TO HIS MIND BUT HE HAD NOT COMPLETE FREEDOM OF IDEAS BECAUSE HE WAS IN AN AGONY OF EMBARRASSMENT THIS AGONY OF EMBARRASSMENT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE SISTER IN LAW WAS SITTING OPPOSITE TO HIM IN A DRESS
AS SVIAZHSKY WAS UNMISTAKABLY AN HONEST GOOD HEARTED SENSIBLE MAN WHO WORKED GOOD HUMOREDLY KEENLY AND PERSEVERINGLY AT HIS WORK HE WAS HELD IN HIGH HONOR BY EVERYONE ABOUT HIM AND CERTAINLY HE HAD NEVER CONSCIOUSLY DONE
I DON'T KNOW BUT IF YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT I'M NOT AT ALL CONVINCED ON THE CONTRARY I FEEL I HAVE NO RIGHT TO GIVE IT UP THAT I HAVE DUTIES BOTH TO THE LAND AND TO MY FAMILY
AND A CUP IN ONE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HAND HE GATHERED UP HIS BEARD HELD IT TO HIS NOSE AND LET IT DROP AGAIN AS THOUGH HE WERE SMELLING IT HIS BRILLIANT BLACK EYES WERE LOOKING STRAIGHT AT THE EXCITED COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WITH GRAY WHISKERS AND APPARENTLY HE DERIVED AMUSEMENT FROM HIS REMARKS
THE GENTLEMAN WAS COMPLAINING OF THE PEASANTS IT WAS EVIDENT TO LEVIN THAT SVIAZHSKY KNEW AN ANSWER TO THIS GENTLEMAN'S COMPLAINTS WHICH WOULD AT ONCE DEMOLISH HIS WHOLE CONTENTION BUT THAT IN HIS POSITION HE COULD NOT GIVE UTTERANCE TO THIS ANSWER AND LISTENED NOT WITHOUT PLEASURE
PERFECTLY TRUE CHIMED IN VASSENKA VESLOVSKY PERFECTLY OBLONSKY OF COURSE GOES OUT OF BONHOMIE BUT OTHER PEOPLE SAY WELL OBLONSKY STAYS WITH THEM NOT A BIT OF IT
IN SPITE OF THE DIRTINESS OF THE HUT WHICH WAS ALL MUDDIED BY THEIR BOOTS AND THE FILTHY DOGS LICKING THEMSELVES CLEAN AND THE SMELL OF MARSH MUD AND POWDER THAT FILLED THE ROOM AND THE ABSENCE OF KNIVES AND FORKS
BUT THAT'S NOT WORK LIKE THE WORK OF A PEASANT OR A LEARNED PROFESSION GRANTED
AND LEVIN KNEW THAT SVIAZHSKY AND HIS WIFE WOULD HAVE GREATLY LIKED TO MARRY THE GIRL TO HIM HE KNEW THIS WITH CERTAINTY AS SO CALLED ELIGIBLE YOUNG MEN ALWAYS KNOW IT
AND HE HAS THE FACULTY OF INTERESTING HIMSELF IN EVERYTHING OH YOU'VE NOT BEEN TO SEE OUR SCHOOL HAVE YOU I'VE SEEN IT THE LITTLE HOUSE COVERED WITH IVY ISN'T IT YES THAT'S NASTIA'S WORK SHE SAID INDICATING HER SISTER
SO FAR AS NOT TRYING TO INCREASE THE DIFFERENCE OF POSITION EXISTING BETWEEN HIM AND ME NO EXCUSE ME THAT'S A PARADOX YES THERE'S SOMETHING OF A SOPHISTRY ABOUT THAT VESLOVSKY AGREED
WHILE THEIR LIFE EXCEEDINGLY DEFINITE AND FIRM IN ITS DIRECTION GOES ITS WAY QUITE APART AND ALMOST ALWAYS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO THEIR CONVICTIONS SVIAZHSKY WAS AN EXTREMELY ADVANCED MAN HE DESPISED THE NOBILITY
NO THAT'S UNFAIR SAID VESLOVSKY HOW COULD ENVY COME IN THERE IS SOMETHING NOT NICE ABOUT THAT SORT OF BUSINESS YOU SAY LEVIN WENT ON THAT IT'S UNJUST FOR ME TO RECEIVE FIVE THOUSAND WHILE THE PEASANT HAS FIFTY
AND THEN TO CHECK THE BOY'S QUESTIONS HE SAID GO TO SLEEP VASKA GO TO SLEEP OR YOU'LL CATCH IT AND SOON AFTER HE BEGAN SNORING HIMSELF AND EVERYTHING WAS STILL HE COULD ONLY HEAR THE SNORT OF THE HORSES
THE MARSH WAS DRY AND THERE WERE NO GROUSE AT ALL HE WALKED ABOUT THE WHOLE DAY AND ONLY BROUGHT BACK THREE BIRDS BUT TO MAKE UP FOR THAT HE BROUGHT BACK AS HE ALWAYS DID FROM SHOOTING AN EXCELLENT APPETITE EXCELLENT SPIRITS
I HEARD HOW IT'S A QUESTION OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE TO BE AWAY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS SHOOTING THAT'S ALL VERY WELL AS AN IDYLLIC EPISODE BUT FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE THAT WON'T ANSWER A MAN MUST BE INDEPENDENT
AND THE GUTTURAL CRY OF A SNIPE IS IT REALLY ONLY NEGATIVE HE REPEATED TO HIMSELF WELL WHAT OF IT IT'S NOT MY FAULT AND HE BEGAN THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT DAY TOMORROW I'LL GO OUT EARLY
DEFINITENESS AND GOOD COURAGE IN LIFE MOREOVER LEVIN KNEW THAT AT SVIAZHSKY'S HE SHOULD MEET THE LANDOWNERS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING FOR HIM JUST NOW TO HEAR AND TAKE PART IN THOSE RURAL CONVERSATIONS CONCERNING CROPS
HOW STRONG THE SMELL OF THE FRESH HAY IS THOUGH SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH GETTING UP THERE'S NOT A CHANCE OF SLEEPING VASSENKA HAS BEEN GETTING UP SOME FUN THERE DO YOU HEAR THE LAUGHING AND HIS VOICE HADN'T WE BETTER GO COME ALONG
WHAT SHOULD THEY TAKE ANYTHING FOR THEY WERE ENTERTAINING YOU TO BE SURE DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY KEEP VODKA FOR SALE SAID THE SOLDIER SUCCEEDING AT LAST IN PULLING THE SOAKED BOOT OFF THE BLACKENED STOCKING
BUT WHO IS TO DEFINE WHAT IS PROPORTIONATE MAKING PROFIT BY DISHONEST MEANS BY TRICKERY SAID LEVIN CONSCIOUS THAT HE COULD NOT DRAW A DISTINCT LINE BETWEEN HONESTY AND DISHONESTY
LET'S GO LET'S HAVE A WALK WE SHAN'T GO TO SLEEP YOU KNOW OBLONSKY COME ALONG IF ONE COULD ONLY DO BOTH LIE HERE AND GO ANSWERED OBLONSKY STRETCHING IT'S CAPITAL LYING HERE
WHO SEEMED TO HIM HUGE AND TERRIBLE CREATURES AND ASKING WHAT THE DOGS WERE GOING TO HUNT NEXT DAY AND THE SOLDIER IN A HUSKY SLEEPY VOICE TELLING HIM THE SPORTSMEN WERE GOING IN THE MORNING TO THE MARSH AND WOULD SHOOT WITH THEIR GUNS
BUT OF COURSE YOU THINK THE RAILWAYS USELESS NO THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION I AM PREPARED TO ADMIT THAT THEY'RE USEFUL BUT ALL PROFIT THAT IS OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE LABOR EXPENDED IS DISHONEST
LEVIN COULD HEAR THAT OBLONSKY WAS SMILING AS HE SPOKE I SIMPLY DON'T CONSIDER HIM MORE DISHONEST THAN ANY OTHER WEALTHY MERCHANT OR NOBLEMAN THEY'VE ALL MADE THEIR MONEY ALIKE BY THEIR WORK AND THEIR INTELLIGENCE
PERHAPS SO SAID LEVIN DRYLY AND HE TURNED ON HIS SIDE TOMORROW EARLY I WANT TO GO SHOOTING AND I WON'T WAKE ANYONE AND SHALL SET OFF AT DAYBREAK
GET THEIR MONEY IN A WAY THAT GAINS THEM THE CONTEMPT OF EVERYONE THEY DON'T CARE FOR THEIR CONTEMPT AND THEN THEY USE THEIR DISHONEST GAINS TO BUY OFF THE CONTEMPT THEY HAVE DESERVED
AND WITH EXTREME INTEREST FOLLOWED EVERYTHING AND KNEW EVERYTHING THAT WAS BEING DONE IN RUSSIA HE CONSIDERED THE RUSSIAN PEASANT AS OCCUPYING A STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THE APE AND THE MAN AND AT THE SAME TIME IN THE LOCAL ASSEMBLIES
OH BY WHAT WORK DO YOU CALL IT WORK TO GET HOLD OF CONCESSIONS AND SPECULATE WITH THEM OF COURSE IT'S WORK WORK IN THIS SENSE THAT IF IT WERE NOT FOR HIM AND OTHERS LIKE HIM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO RAILWAYS
JUST FANCY THEY GAVE ME DRINK FED ME SUCH BREAD IT WAS EXQUISITE
AND WHILE OUT SHOOTING WHEN HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF NOTHING AT ALL SUDDENLY THE OLD MAN AND HIS FAMILY KEPT COMING BACK TO HIS MIND AND THE IMPRESSION OF THEM SEEMED TO CLAIM NOT MERELY HIS ATTENTION
AND BELIEVED THE MASS OF THE NOBILITY TO BE SECRETLY IN FAVOR OF SERFDOM AND ONLY CONCEALING THEIR VIEWS FROM COWARDICE HE REGARDED RUSSIA AS A RUINED COUNTRY RATHER AFTER THE STYLE OF TURKEY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA AS SO BAD
I THOUGHT OUR GENTLEMEN WOULD BE ASLEEP BUT I HEARD THEM CHATTERING I WANT TO GET A HOOK FROM HERE SHE WON'T BITE HE ADDED STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY WITH HIS BARE FEET AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP
HOW IS IT SUCH PEOPLE DON'T DISGUST YOU I CAN UNDERSTAND A LUNCH WITH LAFITTE IS ALL VERY PLEASANT BUT DON'T YOU DISLIKE JUST THAT VERY SUMPTUOUSNESS ALL THESE PEOPLE
AND HOW THEY WERE PRESERVED AND OF THE CARRIAGES AND DOGCARTS IN WHICH THE SHOOTING PARTY HAD BEEN DRIVEN AND THE LUNCHEON PAVILION THAT HAD BEEN RIGGED UP AT THE MARSH I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID LEVIN SITTING UP IN THE HAY
I'VE ONLY JUST COME
THOUGH IT WAS DUSK NOT ONE OF THEM WANTED TO GO TO SLEEP AFTER WAVERING AMONG REMINISCENCES AND ANECDOTES OF GUNS OF DOGS AND OF FORMER SHOOTING PARTIES THE CONVERSATION RESTED ON A TOPIC THAT INTERESTED ALL OF THEM
WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NEGATIVE AGAIN HALF ASLEEP HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER AND MIRTHFUL TALK OF VESLOVSKY AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH FOR AN INSTANT HE OPENED HIS EYES THE MOON WAS UP AND IN THE OPEN DOORWAY
AND VESLOVSKY WITH HIS INFECTIOUS LAUGH WAS REPEATING SOME WORDS PROBABLY SAID TO HIM BY A PEASANT AH YOU DO YOUR BEST TO GET ROUND HER
AFTER VASSENKA HAD SEVERAL TIMES OVER EXPRESSED HIS APPRECIATION OF THIS DELIGHTFUL SLEEPING PLACE AMONG THE FRAGRANT HAY THIS DELIGHTFUL BROKEN CART HE SUPPOSED IT TO BE BROKEN BECAUSE THE SHAFTS HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT
YOU TEACH IN IT YOURSELF ASKED LEVIN TRYING TO LOOK ABOVE THE OPEN NECK BUT FEELING THAT WHEREVER HE LOOKED IN THAT DIRECTION HE SHOULD SEE IT YES I USED TO TEACH IN IT MYSELF AND DO TEACH STILL
SO PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES AND EVERYONE ELSE AND THEIR WELL ORDERED HOME HAD ALWAYS A CHEERING EFFECT ON LEVIN HE FELT A LONGING NOW THAT HE WAS SO DISSATISFIED WITH HIS OWN LIFE TO GET AT THAT SECRET IN SVIAZHSKY THAT GAVE HIM SUCH CLEARNESS
DEPRIVED LEVIN OF THE FULL USE OF HIS FACULTIES HE IMAGINED PROBABLY MISTAKENLY THAT THIS LOW NECKED BODICE HAD BEEN MADE ON HIS ACCOUNT AND FELT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO LOOK AT IT AND TRIED NOT TO LOOK AT IT
OBVIOUSLY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE REFLECTING ON THE QUESTION AND CONSEQUENTLY CONSIDERING IT WITH PERFECT SINCERITY YES YOU FEEL IT BUT YOU DON'T GIVE HIM YOUR PROPERTY SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH
YOU SAY SHE SAID PURSUING THE SUBJECT THAT HAD BEEN STARTED THAT MY HUSBAND CANNOT BE INTERESTED IN WHAT'S RUSSIAN IT'S QUITE THE CONTRARY HE IS ALWAYS IN CHEERFUL SPIRITS ABROAD BUT NOT AS HE IS HERE HERE HE FEELS IN HIS PROPER PLACE
AH OUR HOST SO YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP YET HE SAID TO THE PEASANT WHO CAME INTO THE BARN OPENING THE CREAKING DOOR HOW IS IT YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP
LEVIN HAD IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF THIS
AND SO HE WOULD GO ALL THE SAME BESIDES AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART HE HAD A DESIRE TO TRY HIMSELF PUT HIMSELF TO THE TEST IN REGARD TO THIS GIRL THE SVIAZHSKYS HOME LIFE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PLEASANT AND SVIAZHSKY HIMSELF
OR ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE ENJOYING UNJUST PRIVILEGES AS I DO AND THEN ENJOY THEM AND BE SATISFIED NO IF IT WERE UNJUST YOU COULD NOT ENJOY THESE ADVANTAGES AND BE SATISFIED AT LEAST I COULD NOT
AND MOREOVER A HIGHLY CULTIVATED MAN WHO WAS EXCEPTIONALLY MODEST OVER HIS CULTURE THERE WAS NOT A SUBJECT HE KNEW NOTHING OF BUT HE DID NOT DISPLAY HIS KNOWLEDGE EXCEPT WHEN HE WAS COMPELLED TO DO SO STILL LESS COULD LEVIN SAY THAT HE WAS A KNAVE
NO EXCUSE ME BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THIS INEQUALITY IS UNJUST WHY IS IT YOU DON'T ACT ACCORDINGLY WELL I DO ACT NEGATIVELY ON THAT IDEA
NO ONE WAS READIER TO SHAKE HANDS WITH THE PEASANTS AND LISTEN TO THEIR OPINION HE BELIEVED NEITHER IN GOD NOR THE DEVIL BUT WAS MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUESTION OF THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CLERGY AND THE MAINTENANCE OF THEIR REVENUES AND TOOK SPECIAL TROUBLE TO KEEP UP THE CHURCH IN HIS VILLAGE
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD CLEARLY EXPRESSED HIS THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS TO THE BEST OF HIS CAPACITY AND YET BOTH OF THEM STRAIGHTFORWARD MEN AND NOT FOOLS HAD SAID WITH ONE VOICE THAT HE WAS COMFORTING HIMSELF WITH SOPHISTRIES THIS DISCONCERTED HIM
THOUGH HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE WORK THAN I DO THAT'S DISHONEST I SUPPOSE I CAN'T SAY WELL BUT I CAN TELL YOU YOUR RECEIVING SOME FIVE THOUSAND LET'S SAY FOR YOUR WORK ON THE LAND
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN VAIN EVERY TIME LEVIN TRIED TO PENETRATE BEYOND THE OUTER CHAMBERS OF SVIAZHSKY'S MIND WHICH WERE HOSPITABLY OPEN TO ALL HE NOTICED THAT SVIAZHSKY WAS SLIGHTLY DISCONCERTED FAINT SIGNS OF ALARM WERE VISIBLE IN HIS EYES
AS THOUGH HE WERE AFRAID LEVIN WOULD UNDERSTAND HIM AND HE WOULD GIVE HIM A KINDLY GOOD HUMORED REPULSE JUST NOW SINCE HIS DISENCHANTMENT WITH FARMING
HE CONSIDERED HUMAN LIFE ONLY TOLERABLE ABROAD AND WENT ABROAD TO STAY AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND AT THE SAME TIME HE CARRIED ON A COMPLEX AND IMPROVED SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURE IN RUSSIA
WE ARE GOING OUT FOR THE NIGHT WITH THE BEASTS AH WHAT A NIGHT SAID VESLOVSKY LOOKING OUT AT THE EDGE OF THE HUT AND THE UNHARNESSED WAGONETTE THAT COULD BE SEEN IN THE FAINT LIGHT OF THE EVENING GLOW
I'VE MADE SUCH A DISCOVERY CHARMANTE A PERFECT GRETCHEN AND I'VE ALREADY MADE FRIENDS WITH HER REALLY EXCEEDINGLY PRETTY HE DECLARED IN A TONE OF APPROVAL AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN MADE PRETTY ENTIRELY ON HIS ACCOUNT
OF THE GOOD NATURE OF THE PEASANTS THAT HAD TREATED HIM TO VODKA OF THE DOGS WHO LAY AT THE FEET OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MASTERS OBLONSKY BEGAN TELLING THEM OF A DELIGHTFUL SHOOTING PARTY AT MALTHUS'S WHERE HE HAD STAYED THE PREVIOUS SUMMER
LABORERS WAGES AND SO ON WHICH HE WAS AWARE ARE CONVENTIONALLY REGARDED AS SOMETHING VERY LOW
THAT'S TRUE IT IS UNFAIR AND I FEEL IT BUT IT REALLY IS WHY IS IT WE SPEND OUR TIME RIDING DRINKING SHOOTING DOING NOTHING WHILE THEY ARE FOREVER AT WORK SAID VASSENKA VESLOVSKY
WHILE OUR HOST THE PEASANT HERE HOWEVER HARD HE WORKS CAN NEVER GET MORE THAN FIFTY ROUBLES IS JUST AS DISHONEST AS MY EARNING MORE THAN MY CHIEF CLERK AND MALTHUS GETTING MORE THAN A STATION MASTER
ON THE WOMAN QUESTION HE WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE EXTREME ADVOCATES OF COMPLETE LIBERTY FOR WOMEN AND ESPECIALLY THEIR RIGHT TO LABOR BUT HE LIVED WITH HIS WIFE ON SUCH TERMS THAT THEIR AFFECTIONATE CHILDLESS HOME LIFE WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERYONE
SVIAZHSKY'S CHARACTER WOULD HAVE PRESENTED NO DOUBT OR DIFFICULTY TO HIM HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF A FOOL OR A KNAVE AND EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE SEEMED CLEAR BUT HE COULD NOT SAY A FOOL BECAUSE SVIAZHSKY WAS UNMISTAKABLY CLEVER
SVIAZHSKY WAS THE MARSHAL OF HIS DISTRICT HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLDER THAN LEVIN AND HAD LONG BEEN MARRIED HIS SISTER IN LAW A YOUNG GIRL LEVIN LIKED VERY MUCH LIVED IN HIS HOUSE
THEN HE HEARD THE SOLDIER ARRANGING HIS BED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARN WITH HIS NEPHEW THE YOUNGER SON OF THEIR PEASANT HOST HE HEARD THE BOY IN HIS SHRILL LITTLE VOICE TELLING HIS UNCLE WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE DOGS
THAT HE NEVER PERMITTED HIMSELF TO CRITICIZE ITS DOINGS SERIOUSLY AND YET HE WAS A FUNCTIONARY OF THAT GOVERNMENT AND A MODEL MARSHAL OF NOBILITY AND WHEN HE DROVE ABOUT HE ALWAYS WORE THE COCKADE OF OFFICE AND THE CAP WITH THE RED BAND
THE GREAT THING FOR ME IS TO FEEL THAT I'M NOT TO BLAME WHAT DO YOU SAY WHY NOT GO AFTER ALL SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH EVIDENTLY WEARY OF THE STRAIN OF THOUGHT WE SHAN'T GO TO SLEEP YOU KNOW COME LET'S GO
TO THE LANDOWNER'S COMIC SPEECHES THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE GRAY WHISKERS WAS OBVIOUSLY AN INVETERATE ADHERENT OF SERFDOM AND A DEVOTED AGRICULTURIST WHO HAD LIVED ALL HIS LIFE IN THE COUNTRY
IN THE GREAT FRAME OF THE OPEN DOORS BUT LISTEN THERE ARE WOMEN'S VOICES SINGING AND ON MY WORD NOT BADLY TOO WHO'S THAT SINGING MY FRIEND THAT'S THE MAIDS FROM HARD BY HERE
NO I'M NOT COMING ANSWERED LEVIN SURELY THAT'S NOT A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE TOO SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SMILING AS HE FELT ABOUT IN THE DARK FOR HIS CAP IT'S NOT A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY CONVINCED OF THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS POSITION AND SO TALKED SERENELY AND WITHOUT HASTE BUT YOU HAVE NOT DRAWN THE LINE BETWEEN HONEST AND DISHONEST WORK THAT I RECEIVE A BIGGER SALARY THAN MY CHIEF CLERK
LEVIN TRIED TO UNDERSTAND HIM AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM AND LOOKED AT HIM AND HIS LIFE AS AT A LIVING ENIGMA LEVIN AND HE WERE VERY FRIENDLY AND SO LEVIN USED TO VENTURE TO SOUND SVIAZHSKY TO TRY TO GET AT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF HIS VIEW OF LIFE
NO QUITE THE CONTRARY I SEE THAT SOCIETY TAKES UP A SORT OF ANTAGONISTIC ATTITUDE TO THESE PEOPLE WHICH IS UTTERLY BASELESS AND I FANCY THERE'S ENVY AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
WONDER UPON WONDER HE EXCLAIMED SO YOU REALLY DID SPEAK THE TRUTH AFTER ALL WELL I CANNOT REPROACH YOU THOUGH I SHALL HAVE TO PAY HEAVILY TO MY ROYAL MASTER FOR THE VALUE OF THAT OX BUT COME LET US GO HOME I WILL NEVER SET YOU TO HERD CATTLE AGAIN HENCEFORWARD I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING EASIER TO DO
AND FINDING A LARGE STONE HE FASTENED THE ROPE TO IT AND SANK IT IN THE SWAMP AFTER WHICH HE ARRANGED THE TAILS CAREFULLY ONE BY ONE SO THAT ONLY THEIR POINTS WERE SEEN STICKING OUT OF THE WATER WHEN EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER HE HASTENED HOME TO HIS MASTER WITH SUCH A SORROWFUL FACE
SO LISTENING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL WAS STILL HE STOLE AWAY TO HIS PARENTS AND TOLD THEM THE WHOLE STORY WHEN THEY HAD HEARD EVERYTHING THEY HID HIM WHERE NO ONE COULD FIND HIM TIME PASSED AWAY AND THE YOUNG MAN STAYED AT HOME DOING ALL HIS PARENTS BADE HIM
AND MUST NOT THIS CONCLUSION BE STRENGTHENED WHEN THEY HEAR MINISTERS OF TALENT AND LEARNING DECLARE THAT THE BIBLE DOES SANCTION SLAVEHOLDING AND THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE MADE A DISCIPLINABLE OFFENCE IN CHURCHES AND MUST NOT ALL DOUBT BE DISSIPATED WHEN ONE OF THE MOST LEARNED PROFESSORS IN OUR THEOLOGICAL SEMINARIES
BUT HE CUT OFF THE HEAD OF THE RAM WHICH ALWAYS LED THE FLOCK AND HAD BELLS ROUND ITS HORNS THIS HE TOOK BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FEEDING FOR HERE HE HAD NOTICED A HIGH ROCK WITH A PATCH OF GREEN GRASS IN THE MIDDLE AND TWO OR THREE THICK BUSHES GROWING ON THE EDGE
NO NO ANSWERED THE YOUTH I AM NOT SO STUPID AS THAT WE WILL KILL THEM AND HAVE THEM FOR DINNER YOU WILL LOSE YOUR LIFE IF YOU DO REPLIED THE FATHER OH I AM NOT SURE OF THAT SAID THE SON
AND HE THOUGHT THAT A MAN WHO WAS SO CLEVER WAS JUST THE MAN TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY
AND THE PREROGATIVES THEY ENJOY OVER THE INFERIOR CLASSES WHOM THEY TREAT WITH THE UTMOST SUPERCILIOUSNESS AND HOLD IN THE MOST UNREASONABLE CONTEMPT IN THE MEAN TIME THEIR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS ARE CONDEMNED TO THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE NEGLECT THEY DWELL AT HOME CARELESS OF WHAT PASSES THERE
WITH HIS SON AND HIS OWN COW AT THEIR HEAD WHOSE CATTLE ARE THESE AND WHY ARE THEY HERE HE ASKED AND HIS SON TOLD HIM THE STORY
BETROTHING AND MARRIAGE AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD FAMILIES WHO LIVED IN A FRIENDLY MANNER FELL UPON A METHOD OF SECURING THEIR CHILDREN TO EACH OTHER BY WHAT IS CALLED IN THE SACRED WRITINGS BETROTHING
WHEN HE DESIGNED TO DO US GOOD HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE FORM OF A SERVANT HE TOOK HIS STATION AT THE BOTTOM OF SOCIETY HE VOLUNTARILY IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH THE POOR AND THE DESPISED THE WARNING VOICES OF JEREMIAH AND EZEKIEL WERE RAISED IN OLDEN TIME AGAINST SIN
THEN THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING RAN HOME TO HIS MASTER
THIS WAS THE MOST COMMON WAY OF MARRYING AMONG THE ROMANS IT CONTINUED IN USE EVEN AFTER THEY BECAME CHRISTIANS
IN A TINY COTTAGE NEAR THE KING'S PALACE THERE ONCE LIVED AN OLD MAN HIS WIFE AND HIS SON A VERY LAZY FELLOW WHO WOULD NEVER DO A STROKE OF WORK HE COULD NOT BE GOT EVEN TO LOOK AFTER THEIR ONE COW
MARRIAGES AMONG THE JEWS SAY THE RABBIES WERE AGREED ON BY THE PARENTS AND RELATIONS OF BOTH SIDES WHEN THIS WAS DONE THE BRIDEGROOM WAS INTRODUCED TO HIS BRIDE PRESENTS WERE MUTUALLY EXCHANGED
STILL THE SOUND OF SHEEP BELLS RANG SOFTLY FROM ABOVE AND THE HERDSMAN KNEW THEM TO BE THOSE HE HAD HUNG ON THE HORNS OF HIS RAM DO YOU HEAR ASKED THE YOUTH YES I HEAR
SLOWLY AND SADLY HE WENT TO BED BUT HE COULD NOT SLEEP FOR WONDERING HOW THE SCYTHES WERE TO BE MADE
THE CEREMONY OF THE FIRST CONSISTED IN THE YOUNG COUPLE EATING A CAKE TOGETHER MADE ONLY OF WHEAT SALT AND WATER THE SECOND KIND WAS CELEBRATED BY THE PARTIES SOLEMNLY PLEDGING THEIR FAITH TO EACH OTHER BY GIVING AND RECEIVING A PIECE OF MONEY
A VIEW OF MATRIMONY IN THREE DIFFERENT LIGHTS THE MARRIAGE LIFE IS ALWAYS AN INSIPID A VEXATIOUS OR A HAPPY CONDITION THE FIRST IS WHEN TWO PEOPLE OF NO TASTE MEET TOGETHER
SET OFF WITH PLUMES OF FEATHERS RIBBONS AND BELLS AS THIS DIVERSION IS TAKEN CHIEFLY IN THE NIGHT TIME SERVANTS RIDE BEFORE THE SLEDGE WITH TORCHES AND A GENTLEMAN STANDING ON THE SLEDGE BEHIND GUIDES THE HORSE
BUT THE SON ONLY LAUGHED AND SAID NO NO
AND AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE CEREMONY THE BRIDE WAS THEN CARRIED TO THE NUPTIAL BED AND THE BRIDEGROOM LEFT WITH HER THE COMPANY AGAIN RETURNED TO THEIR FEASTING AND REJOICING AND THE RABBIES INFORM US THAT THIS FEASTING WHEN THE BRIDE WAS A WIDOW
IN THIS CASE IF THEY MADE UP THE MATTER BETWEEN THEMSELVES IT BECAME A VALID MARRIAGE AND THE CHILDREN WERE CONSIDERED AS LEGITIMATE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS IS THE PRESENT CUSTOM IN SCOTLAND
WHEN ALL WAS DONE TO HIS LIKING HE HASTENED QUICKLY BACK TO HIS MASTER WHERE ARE THE SHEEP
THEIR LOOKS AND FEATURES THOUGH NOT UNSIGHTLY BETRAY A VACANCY OF THAT LIFE AND SPIRIT WITHOUT WHICH BEAUTY IS UNINTERESTING AND LIKE A MERE PICTURE BECOMES UTTERLY VOID OF THAT INDICATION OF SENSIBILITY WHICH ALONE CAN AWAKEN A DELICACY OF FEELING
IT WILL COST YOU YOUR LIFE IF YOU DO ANSWERED THE FATHER SHAKING HIS HEAD WELL I WILL DO MY BEST REPLIED HIS SON BUT FIRST GIVE ME THE SWORD WHICH HANGS OVER YOUR BED
BUT IN A SHORT TIME THEY GREW AS WILD AS THE PIGS HAD DONE AND SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS THE YOUNG MAN COULD NOT COLLECT THEM TRY AS HE WOULD AND HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT THIS WAS THE PUNISHMENT FOR HIS LAZINESS IN REFUSING TO LOOK AFTER HIS FATHER'S ONE COW
MEMBERS IN GOOD AND REGULAR STANDING FELLOWSHIPPED THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM EXCEPT BY A FEW ANTI SLAVERY CHURCHES GENERALLY DESPISED AS ULTRA AND RADICAL REDUCE THEIR FELLOW MEN TO THE CONDITION OF CHATTELS AND BY FORCE KEEP THEM IN THAT STATE OF DEGRADATION
SAID GEORGIANA WILL YOU GRANT ME ONE FAVOUR OR RATHER MAKE ME A PROMISE I CAN'T TELL MY DEAR TILL I KNOW WHAT IT IS REPLIED MISTER PECK IF IT IS A REASONABLE REQUEST I WILL COMPLY WITH YOUR WISH CONTINUED HE I HOPE MY DEAR ANSWERED SHE
THEY PROFESS THE MOST BOUNDLESS BELIEF IN ALL THE SILLY LEGENDS WITH WHICH THEIR TREATISES OF DEVOTION ARE FILLED AND THESE ARE THE ONLY BOOKS THEY EVER READ THE COLDNESS OF THEIR CONSTITUTION OCCASIONS A SPECIES OF REGULATED GALLANTRY
BEING IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE TO ALMOST ALL BENEVOLENT CAUSES TO WHICH HE TOOK A FANCY HE WAS A MOST LOVING FATHER AND HIS DAUGHTER EXERCISED CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER HIM AND OWING TO HER PIETY AND JUDGMENT THAT INFLUENCE HAD A BENEFICIAL EFFECT
THAT IS NOTHING BUT A LIE FROM BEGINNING TO END SAID THE HERDSMAN NO IT IS AS TRUE AS THAT THERE IS A SUN IN HEAVEN ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THEN GIVE ME A PROOF OF IT CRIED HIS MASTER WELL COME WITH ME SAID THE YOUTH
SEATED BETWEEN HER HUSBAND AND ONE OF HIS RELATIONS WHEN SHE ALIGHTED FROM THE CHARIOT THE AXLE TREE OF IT WAS BURNT TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS NO METHOD FOR HER TO RETURN BACK AS SOON AS THE YOUNG COUPLE ENTERED THE HOUSE FIGS AND OTHER FRUITS WERE THROWN UPON THEIR HEADS TO DENOTE PLENTY
AT LAST HOWEVER THE SHEEP SEEMED TIRED OF RUNNING ABOUT AND THEN THE YOUTH MANAGED TO GATHER THEM TOGETHER AND DROVE THEM AS BEFORE STRAIGHT TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE WHOSE SHEEP ARE THESE AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE ASKED THE OLD MAN IN WONDER AND HIS SON TOLD HIM BUT WHEN THE TALE WAS ENDED THE FATHER SHOOK HIS HEAD
DRESS IN A VERY DIFFERENT MANNER AND SOME OF THEM INCONCEIVABLY FANTASTIC AS MAY BE SEEN IN MANY PRINTS PUBLISHED IN BOOKS OF TRAVELS BUT IN THIS RESPECT THEY ARE GRADUALLY REFORMING AND MANY OF THEM MAKE QUITE A DIFFERENT APPEARANCE IN THEIR DRESS FROM WHAT THEY DID THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO
AND MUST GO OUT INTO THE WORLD TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE
LEAVING ONLY THE POINTS OF THEIR TAILS WHICH YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF YOU HAVE MADE UP THAT STORY VERY WELL REPLIED THE HERDSMAN
YES YOUR STORY WAS TRUE AFTER ALL IT IS A WONDERFUL THING SAID THE HERDSMAN BUT I SEE IT IS NO FAULT OF YOURS AND I MUST PUT UP WITH MY LOSS AS WELL AS I CAN NOW LET US RETURN HOME FOR IT IS TIME FOR SUPPER NEXT MORNING THE HERDSMAN SAID TO THE YOUNG MAN
BUT AS HE DID NOT SEE ANY OTHER WAY OF GETTING A BED HE WENT SLOWLY IN THE HERDSMAN'S TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR MOTHER WERE SITTING AT SUPPER AND INVITED HIM TO JOIN THEM NOTHING MORE WAS SAID ABOUT WORK AND WHEN THE MEAL WAS OVER THEY ALL WENT TO BED
DOES NOT THE LANGUAGE INASMUCH AS YE DID IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE DID IT UNTO ME BELONG TO ALL WHO ARE RIGHTLY ENGAGED IN ENDEAVOURING TO UNLOOSE THE BONDMAN'S FETTERS SHALL WE NOT THEN DO AS THE APOSTLES DID
AND NO ONE WAS MORE ABLE THAN HERSELF TO IMPRESS THOSE VIEWS UPON THE HEARTS OF ALL WITH WHOM SHE CAME IN CONTACT
THE FORMER WE MAY IN SOME MEASURE DEFEND OURSELVES FROM THE OTHER IS THE COMMON LOT OF HUMANITY LOVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RICHES OR STATE SOLITUDE WITH THE PERSON BELOVED HAS A PLEASURE EVEN IN A WOMAN'S MIND BEYOND SHOW OR POMP
OH I AM USED TO THAT ANSWERED THE YOUTH YES BUT THIS TIME YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IT PROPERLY SAID THE HERDSMAN AND HE TOOK THE YOUTH TO THE PLACE WHERE THE PIGS WERE FEEDING
AND THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE SPOT
PROBABLY FOR STRENGTH TO DO THE WORK WHICH HE HAD APPOINTED THEM UNTO FOR THEY FELT THAT WITHOUT HIM THEY COULD DO NOTHING AND THEY CONSECRATED THEMSELVES ON THE ALTAR OF GOD TO THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS ENTERPRISE OF PREACHING THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST TO A LOST AND PERISHING WORLD
WITHOUT SENSE OF THE LAWS OF KINDNESS GOOD NATURE MUTUAL OFFICES AND THE ELEGANT SATISFACTIONS WHICH FLOW FROM REASON AND VIRTUE THE VEXATIOUS LIFE ARISES FROM A CONJUNCTION OF TWO PEOPLE OF QUICK TASTE AND RESENTMENT PUT TOGETHER FOR REASONS WELL KNOWN TO THEIR FRIENDS
I HAVE THOUGHT OF EXACTLY THE THING FOR YOU SAID THE HERDSMAN AS THEY WALKED ALONG AND IT IS SO SIMPLE THAT YOU CANNOT MAKE A MISTAKE
ARE YET CAPABLE OF THE TRUEST ATTACHMENT AND ALWAYS WARM AND ZEALOUS IN THE CAUSE OF THOSE WHOM THEY HAVE ADMITTED TO THEIR FRIENDSHIP THOUGH THE GERMANS ARE RATHER A DULL AND PHLEGMATIC PEOPLE AND NOT GREATLY ENSLAVED BY THE WARMER PASSIONS YET AT THE COURT OF VIENNA THEY ARE MUCH GIVEN TO INTRIGUE
HERE WE SEE GOD DEALING IN SLAVES GIVING THEM TO HIS OWN FAVOURITE CHILD ABRAHAM A MAN OF SUPERLATIVE WORTH AND AS A REWARD FOR HIS EMINENT GOODNESS
SHOULD DO OUR UTMOST TO EXTIRPATE SLAVERY FROM THE LAND FOR MY OWN PART I SHALL DO ALL I CAN WHEN THE REDEEMER WAS ABOUT TO ASCEND TO THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER AND RESUME THE GLORY WHICH HE HAD WITH HIM BEFORE THE WORLD WAS HE PROMISED HIS DISCIPLES THAT THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST SHOULD COME UPON THEM
THE CONDITION OF THE NEGROES HUCKELBY AND SNYDER AND ESPECIALLY HOW HE LIKED THE SERMON OF THE LATTER MISTER PECK WAS A KIND OF A PATRIARCH IN HIS OWN WAY TO BEGIN WITH HE WAS A MAN OF SOME TALENT
TO GRANT REPENTANCE TO OUR GUILTY COUNTRY AND PERMIT US TO AID IN PREPARING THE WAY FOR THE GLORIOUS SECOND ADVENT OF THE MESSIAH BY PREACHING DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES AND THE OPENING OF THE PRISON DOORS TO THOSE WHO ARE BOUND
MY DEAR GEORGIANA SAID MISTER PECK I MUST BE PERMITTED TO ENTERTAIN MY OWN VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT AND TO EXERCISE MY OWN JUDGMENT BELIEVE ME DEAR PAPA SHE REPLIED
THE INHABITANTS OF VIENNA LIVED LUXURIOUSLY A GREAT PART OF THEIR TIME BEING SPENT IN FEASTING AND CAROUSING IN WINTER WHEN THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE DANUBE ARE FROZEN OVER AND THE GROUND COVERED WITH SNOW THE LADIES TAKE THEIR RECREATION IN SLEDGES OF DIFFERENT SHAPES SUCH AS GRIFFINS
CARLTON THOUGH A SCHOOLFELLOW OF THE PARSON'S WAS NEVERTHELESS NEARLY TEN YEARS HIS JUNIOR AND THOUGH NOT AN AVOWED INFIDEL WAS HOWEVER A FREETHINKER AND ONE WHO TOOK NO NOTE OF TO MORROW AND FOR THIS REASON GEORGIANA TOOK PECULIAR INTEREST IN THE YOUNG MAN
AND TO PERFORM ALL THAT IS GENERALLY IMPLIED IN CONTRACTS OF MARRIAGE IN FAVOR OF THE ISRAELITISH WIVES THE VERBAL AGREEMENT WAS MADE IN THE PRESENCE OF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF WITNESSES BY THE MAN SAYING TO THE WOMEN
THAT THE GERMAN YOUTH OFTEN VISIT SAXONY IN QUEST OF COMPANIONS FOR LIFE EXCLUSIVE OF THEIR BEAUTY AND COMELINESS OF APPEARANCE THEY ARE BROUGHT UP IN A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THOSE ARTS BOTH USEFUL AND ORNAMENTAL WHICH ARE SO BRILLIANT AN ADDITION TO THEIR NATIVE ATTRACTIONS
AS THEY ARE COMMONLY CAREFUL TO IMPROVE THEIR MINDS BY READING AND INSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION THEY HAVE NO SMALL SHARE OF FACETIOUSNESS AND INGENUITY
THEN HE CUT OFF THE TAILS AND TIED THEM TOGETHER WITH A PIECE OF CORD AND SWINGING THE BUNDLE OVER HIS BACK HE RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FEEDING
FOR MENSTEALERS FOR LIARS FOR PERJURED PERSONS A MORE SCATHING DENUNCIATION OF THE SIN IN QUESTION IS SURELY TO BE FOUND ON RECORD IN NO OTHER BOOK I AM AFRAID CONTINUED THE DAUGHTER THAT THE ACTS OF THE PROFESSED FRIENDS OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE SOUTH
AND THEIR CONVERSATION HAD PASSED BY HIM UNHEEDED BUT WHEN A YOUNG GIRL MUCH YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF REASONED WITH HIM IN THAT INNOCENT AND PERSUASIVE MANNER THAT WOMAN IS WONT TO USE WHEN SHE HAS ENTERED WITH HER WHOLE SOUL UPON AN OBJECT IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIS STOUT HEART AND HE YIELDED
OR IF HE BE FOUND IN HIS BAND HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH AND WOE UNTO HIM THAT BUILDETH HIS HOUSE BY UNRIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIS CHAMBERS BY WRONG THAT USETH HIS NEIGHBOUR'S SERVICE WITHOUT WAGES AND GIVETH HIM NOT FOR HIS WORK
THAT YOU SHALL HAVE REPLIED THE MAN BUT TO MORROW I SHALL GIVE YOU SOME WORK TO DO FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT I AM THE CHIEF HERDSMAN OF THE KING THE YOUTH MADE NO ANSWER TO THIS
I DON'T THINK THAT THE BIBLE SANCTIONS SLAVERY
WAS SENT AWAY TO THE HABITATION OF HER HUSBAND IN THE NIGHT WITH SINGING DANCING AND THE SOUND OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BY THE INSTITUTION OF MOSES THE RABBIES TELL US THE CONTRACT OF MARRIAGE WAS READ IN THE PRESENCE OF AND SIGNED BY AT LEAST TEN WITNESSES
LET US NOT FORGET WHAT FOLLOWED THEREFORE THUS SAITH THE LORD YE HAVE NOT HARKENED UNTO ME IN PROCLAIMING LIBERTY EVERY ONE TO HIS BROTHER AND EVERY ONE TO HIS NEIGHBOUR BEHOLD I PROCLAIM A LIBERTY FOR YOU SAITH THE LORD TO THE SWORD TO THE PESTILENCE AND TO THE FAMINE
TIGERS SWANS SCALLOP SHELLS ET CETERA HERE THE LADY SITS DRESSED IN VELVET LINED WITH RICH FURS AND ADORNED WITH LACES AND JEWELS HAVING ON HER HEAD A VELVET CAP THE SLEDGE IS DRAWN BY ONE HORSE STAG OR OTHER CREATURE
CONTINUE IN PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION THAT GOD WILL GRANT US THE SUPPLIES OF HIS SPIRIT
GEORGIANA'S FIRST OBJECT HOWEVER WAS TO AWAKEN IN CARLTON'S BREAST A LOVE FOR THE LORD JESUS CHRIST THE YOUNG MAN HAD OFTEN SAT UNDER THE SOUND OF THE GOSPEL WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE HE HAD HEARD MEN TALK WHO HAD GROWN GREY BENDING OVER THE SCRIPTURES
BUT SHE GOES WITH HER FORTUNE RATHER THAN HER FORTUNE WITH HER THESE MAKE UP THE CROWD OR VULGAR OF THE RICH AND FILL UP THE LUMBER OF THE HUMAN RACE WITHOUT BENEFICENCE TOWARDS THOSE BELOW THEM OR RESPECT TOWARDS THOSE ABOVE THEM AND LEAD A DESPICABLE INDEPENDENT AND USELESS LIFE
THEN SHOULD OUR LABOUR FAIL TO ACCOMPLISH THE END FOR WHICH WE PRAY WE SHALL STAND ACQUITTED AT THE BAR OF JEHOVAH AND ALTHOUGH WE MAY SHARE IN THE NATIONAL CALAMITIES WHICH AWAIT UNREPENTED SINS YET THAT BLESSED APPROVAL WILL BE OURS
WHEN ALSO THE NEW TESTAMENT EXHIBITS SUCH WORDS OF REBUKE AS THESE BEHOLD THE HIRE OF THE LABOURERS WHO HAVE REAPED DOWN YOUR FIELDS WHICH IS OF YOU KEPT BACK BY FRAUD CRIETH
HER NEXT AIM WAS TO VINDICATE THE BIBLE FROM SUSTAINING THE MONSTROUS INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY SHE SAID GOD HAS CREATED OF ONE BLOOD ALL THE NATIONS OF MEN TO DWELL ON ALL THE FACE OF THE EARTH TO CLAIM HOLD AND TREAT A HUMAN BEING AS PROPERTY IS FELONY AGAINST GOD AND MAN
AFTER THE VIRGINS HAD SUNG A MARRIAGE SONG THE COMPANY PARTOOK OF A REPAST THE MOST MAGNIFICENT THE PARTIES COULD AFFORD AFTER WHICH THEY BEGAN A DANCE THE MEN ROUND THE BRIDEGROOM THE WOMEN ROUND THE BRIDE THEY PRETENDED THAT THIS DANCE WAS OF DIVINE INSTITUTION
TO DAY YOU MUST TAKE A HUNDRED SHEEP TO GRAZE BUT BE CAREFUL THAT NO HARM BEFALLS THEM I WILL DO MY BEST REPLIED THE YOUTH AND HE OPENED THE GATE OF THE FOLD WHERE THE SHEEP HAD BEEN ALL NIGHT AND DROVE THEM OUT INTO THE MEADOW
LATE IN THE EVENING HE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF THE HERDSMAN AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WHICH WAS OPENED BY A LITTLE BOY
HAVE WE LESS PRECIOUS PROMISES IN THE SCRIPTURES OF TRUTH MAY WE NOT CLAIM OF OUR GOD THE BLESSING PROMISED UNTO THOSE WHO CONSIDER THE POOR
THEY EXCEL IN THE ALLUREMENTS OF DRESS AND DECORATION AND ARE IN GENERAL SKILFUL IN MUSIC THE CHARACTER HOWEVER OF THE WOMEN IN MOST OTHER PARTS OF GERMANY PARTICULARLY OF THE AUSTRIAN IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THIS NOTWITHSTANDING THE ADVANTAGES OF SIZE AND MAKE
BY THIS TIME IT WAS EVENING AND THE DUSK WAS FALLING THE YOUNG MAN BROUGHT THE HERDSMAN TO THE FOOT OF THE GREAT ROCK
BLESSED ART THOU O LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH WHO HAS CREATED MAN IN THINE OWN LIKENESS AND HAST APPOINTED WOMAN TO BE HIS PARTNER AND COMPANION BLESSED ART THOU WHO FILLEST ZION WITH JOY FOR THE MULTITUDE OF HER CHILDREN BLESSED ART THOU WHO SENDEST GLADNESS TO THE BRIDEGROOM AND HIS BRIDE
THIS WAS AGREEING ON A PRICE TO BE PAID FOR THE BRIDE THE TIME WHEN IT SHOULD BE PAID AND WHEN SHE SHOULD BE DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF HER HUSBAND THERE WERE ACCORDING TO THE TALMUDISTS THREE WAYS OF BETROTHING
BUT WHAT CHIEFLY ENHANCES THEIR VALUE AND GIVES IT REALITY AND DURATION IS A SWEETNESS OF TEMPER AND FESTIVITY OF DISPOSITION THAT NEVER FAIL TO ENDEAR THEM ON A VERY SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE TO CROWN ALL THEY ARE GENERALLY PATTERNS OF CONJUGAL TENDERNESS AND FIDELITY
LET US NOT DECEIVE OURSELVES INTO THE IDEA THAT SLAVERY IS RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS PROFITABLE TO US SLAVEHOLDING IS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT TO TAKE FROM A MAN HIS EARNINGS IS THEFT BUT TO TAKE THE EARNER IS A COMPOUND LIFE LONG THEFT
WHO WERE FREE AND OF AGE THE BRIDE WHO HAD TAKEN CARE TO BATHE HERSELF THE NIGHT BEFORE APPEARED IN ALL HER SPLENDOR BUT VEILED IN IMITATION OF REBECCA WHO VEILED HERSELF WHEN SHE CAME IN SIGHT OF ISAAC SHE WAS THEN GIVEN TO THE BRIDEGROOM BY HER PARENTS IN WORDS TO THIS PURPOSE
IT INFALLIBLY DENOTED SEPARATION AND ALL THE ILLS ATTENDING AN UNHAPPY MARRIAGE ON THE WEDDING DAY THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM WERE RICHLY DRESSED AND ADORNED WITH GARLANDS OF HERBS AND FLOWERS THE BRIDE WAS CONDUCTED IN THE EVENING TO THE HOUSE OF HER HUSBAND IN A CHARIOT
FOR I WANT THE GRASS MOWN IN ONE OF MY MEADOWS TO MORROW AT THESE WORDS THE YOUTH'S HEART SANK FOR HE HAD NEVER BEEN TRAINED EITHER AS A SMITH OR A JOINER
UP THIS ROCK HE CLIMBED WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND FASTENED THE RAM'S HEAD TO THE BUSHES WITH A CORD LEAVING ONLY THE TIPS OF THE HORNS WITH THE BELLS VISIBLE AS THERE WAS A SOFT BREEZE BLOWING THE BUSHES TO WHICH THE HEAD WAS TIED MOVED GENTLY AND THE BELLS RANG
THE SECOND BY A VERBAL AGREEMENT ACCOMPANIED WITH A PIECE OF MONEY AND THE THIRD BY THE PARTIES COMING TOGETHER AND LIVING AS HUSBAND AND WIFE WHICH MIGHT AS PROPERLY BE CALLED MARRIAGE AS BETROTHING THE WRITTEN CONTRACT WAS IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
BUT TO DAY I HAVE SOMETHING QUITE EASY FOR YOU TO DO YOU MUST LOOK AFTER FORTY OXEN AND BE SURE YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL FOR ONE OF THEM HAS GOLD TIPPED HORNS AND HOOFS AND THE KING RECKONS IT AMONG HIS GREATEST TREASURES THE YOUNG MAN DROVE OUT THE OXEN INTO THE MEADOW
OH DON'T SPEAK OF THEM ANSWERED HE
THEN THE YOUNG MAN WENT HOME TO HIS PARENTS AND BADE THEM GET READY TO WELCOME HIS BRIDE AND WHEN THE WEDDING WAS OVER HE TOLD HIS FATHER IN LAW THE HERDSMAN WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH THE SHEEP AND PIGS AND CATTLE BY AND BY THE STORY CAME TO THE KING'S EARS
ASKED THE OLD MAN IN SURPRISE WHEN HIS SON KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HUT HE HAD LEFT ONLY THE DAY BEFORE THEY BELONG TO THE KING'S CHIEF HERDSMAN ANSWERED HIS SON
AND TO SING EPITHALAMIA AT THE DOOR OF THEIR BED CHAMBER EPITHALAMIA WERE MARRIAGE SONGS ANCIENTLY SUNG IN PRAISE OF THE BRIDE OR BRIDEGROOM WISHING THEM HAPPINESS PROSPERITY AND A NUMEROUS ISSUE AMONG THE ROMANS THERE WERE THREE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MARRIAGE
AND SUFFER DISORDER AND CONFUSION TO PREVAIL WITHOUT FEELING THE LEAST UNEASINESS GREAT FREQUENTERS OF CHURCHES THEIR PIETY CONSISTS IN THE STRICTEST CONFORMITY TO ALL THE EXTERNALS OF RELIGION
WHY GEORGIANA MY DEAR YOU ARE MAD AIN'T YOU EXCLAIMED HE IN AN EXCITED TONE THE POOR GIRL REMAINED SILENT THE FATHER SAW IN A MOMENT THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TOO SHARPLY AND TAKING HER HAND IN HIS HE SAID
CRIED THE FATHER PALE WITH HORROR WE SHOULD CERTAINLY BOTH BE PUT TO DEATH IF I DID ANY SUCH THING NO NO DO AS I TELL YOU AND I WILL GET OUT OF IT SOMEHOW REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN AND IN THE END HE HAD HIS WAY THE PIGS WERE KILLED AND LAID SIDE BY SIDE IN A ROW
WHERE ARE THE PIGS ASKED HE OH DON'T SPEAK OF THEM ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN I REALLY CAN HARDLY TELL YOU THE MOMENT THEY GOT INTO THE FIELD THEY BECAME QUITE MAD AND EACH RAN IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION
IN THE WAY OF RAISING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR FOREIGN MISSIONS HE TOOK THE LEAD OF ALL OTHERS IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD EVERYTHING HE DID HE DID FOR THE GLORY OF GOD AS HE SAID HE QUOTED SCRIPTURE FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING HE DID
AT LENGTH HE CAME TO A LARGE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE KNOCKED WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE OLD MAN WHO OPENED IT AND THE YOUTH TOLD HIM HOW HIS FATHER HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF HIS HOUSE BECAUSE HE WAS SO LAZY AND STUPID AND HE NEEDED SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT
NOW MAKE THE BEST OF YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND KILL THEM AND HANG THEM UP AT ONCE
FOR THE ARGUMENT FROM INTERNAL EVIDENCE IS NOT ONLY REFUTED BUT ACTUALLY TURNED AGAINST THE BIBLE IF THE BIBLE SANCTIONS SLAVERY THEN IT MISREPRESENTS THE CHARACTER OF GOD NOTHING WOULD BE MORE DANGEROUS TO THE SOUL OF A YOUNG CONVERT
THAN TO SATISFY HIM THAT THE SCRIPTURES FAVOURED SUCH A SYSTEM OF SIN DON'T YOU SUPPOSE THAT I UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES BETTER THAN YOU
THE CASE IS THE SAME IN HOLLAND AND SOME PARTS OF GERMANY WITH THIS DIFFERENCE ONLY
LASTED ONLY THREE DAYS BUT SEVEN IF SHE WAS A VIRGIN AT THE BIRTH OF A SON THE FATHER PLANTED A CEDAR AND AT THAT OF A DAUGHTER HE PLANTED A PINE OF THESE TREES THE NUPTIAL BED WAS CONSTRUCTED WHEN THE PARTIES AT WHOSE BIRTH THEY WERE PLANTED ENTERED INTO THE MARRIED STATE
WHAT WAS THE EFFECT UPON THEIR MINDS THEY ALL CONTINUED WITH ONE ACCORD IN PRAYER AND SUPPLICATION WITH THE WOMEN STIMULATED BY THE CONFIDENT EXPECTATION THAT JESUS WOULD FULFIL HIS GRACIOUS PROMISE THEY POURED OUT THEIR HEARTS IN FERVENT SUPPLICATIONS
IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND I I RAN AFTER THEM AND NEARLY DIED OF FATIGUE THEN I HEARD A A NOISE WHICH I I THOUGHT WAS THE WIND BUT BUT IT WAS THE SHEEP WHICH BE BEFORE MY VERY EYES WERE CARRIED STRAIGHT UP UP INTO THE AIR I STOOD WATCHING THEM AS IF I WAS TURNED TO STONE
WHICH THE SAID A DOTH PROMISE TO PERFORM ON THE DAY OF MARRIAGE AND TO THIS THE SAID A DOTH HEREBY BIND HIMSELF AND ALL THAT HE HATH TO THE VERY CLOAK UPON HIS BACK ENGAGES HIMSELF TO LOVE HONOR FEED CLOTHE AND PROTECT HER
I RAN TOO HITHER AND THITHER BUT AS FAST AS I CAUGHT ONE ANOTHER WAS OFF TILL I WAS IN DESPAIR AT LAST HOWEVER I COLLECTED THEM ALL AND WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE THEM BACK WHEN SUDDENLY THEY RUSHED DOWN THE HILL INTO THE SWAMP WHERE THEY VANISHED COMPLETELY
HE NOT ONLY HAD A GOOD EDUCATION BUT WAS A MAN OF GREAT ELOQUENCE AND HAD A WONDERFUL COMMAND OF LANGUAGE HE TOO EITHER HAD OR THOUGHT HE HAD POETICAL GENIUS AND WAS OFTEN SENDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NATCHEZ FREE TRADER AND OTHER PERIODICALS
VERY GENERALLY DEFEND THE CONDUCT OF THOSE WHO DO AND ACCORD TO THEM A FAIR CHRISTIAN CHARACTER
THE SON HAD A ROPE READY TO CAST ROUND ITS HORNS AND THROW IT TO THE GROUND BUT THE OX WAS STRONGER THAN THE ROPE AND SOON TORE IT IN PIECES THEN IT DASHED AWAY TO THE WOOD THE YOUTH FOLLOWING OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES THEY BOTH WENT TILL THEY REACHED THE ROCKY PASS WHICH BORDERED THE HERDSMAN'S LAND
BUT LEFT HER TO LOOK AFTER HERSELF WHILE HE LAY ON A BANK AND WENT TO SLEEP IN THE SUN FOR A LONG TIME HIS FATHER BORE WITH HIM HOPING THAT AS HE GREW OLDER HE MIGHT GAIN MORE SENSE BUT AT LAST THE OLD MAN'S PATIENCE WAS WORN OUT
AND SHOWING HIMSELF VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE HAD BEEN BEFORE HE WENT OUT TO SEE THE WORLD BUT ONE DAY HE SAID TO HIS FATHER THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO MARRY AND HAVE A HOUSE OF HIS OWN WHEN I SERVED THE KING'S CHIEF HERDSMAN ADDED HE I SAW HIS DAUGHTER AND I AM RESOLVED TO TRY IF I CANNOT WIN HER FOR MY WIFE
YES ANSWERED HE I DID NOT KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT THEN
BUT ONLY GRANT MY REQUEST NOT TO ALLUDE TO THE BIBLE AS SANCTIONING SLAVERY WHEN SPEAKING WITH MISTER CARLTON WELL RETURNED HE
THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS OPPOSED TO SLAVEHOLDING IN ITS SPIRIT AND ITS PRINCIPLES IT CLASSES MENSTEALERS AMONG MURDERERS AND IT IS THE DUTY OF ALL WHO WISH TO MEET GOD IN PEACE TO DISCHARGE THAT DUTY IN SPREADING THESE PRINCIPLES
THESE GOOD PEOPLE LIVE IN A CONSTANT RESTRAINT BEFORE COMPANY AND WHEN ALONE REVILE EACH OTHER'S PERSON AND CONDUCT IN COMPANY THEY ARE IN PURGATORY WHEN BY THEMSELVES IN HELL THE HAPPY MARRIAGE IS WHERE TWO PERSONS MEET
AS THEIR EDUCATION IS CONDUCTED BY THE RULES OF THE GROSSEST SUPERSTITION AND THEY ARE TAUGHT LITTLE ELSE THAN SET FORMS OF DEVOTION THEY ARRIVE TO THE YEARS OF MATURITY UNINSTRUCTED IN THE USE OF REASON AND USUALLY CONTINUE PROFOUNDLY IGNORANT THE REMAINDER OF THEIR DAYS
THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN FELT THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING UP TO THAT FAITH THAT SHE PROFESSED AND BELIEVED IN IF SHE DID NOT EXERT HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO SAVE THE THOUGHTLESS MAN FROM HIS DOWNWARD CAREER AND IN THIS SHE SUCCEEDED TO HER MOST SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS
GEORGIANA HAD SUCCEEDED IN RIVETING THE ATTENTION OF CARLTON DURING HER CONVERSATION AND AS SHE WAS FINISHING HER LAST SENTENCE SHE OBSERVED THE SILENT TEAR STEALING DOWN THE CHEEK OF THE NEWLY BORN CHILD OF GOD AT THIS JUNCTURE HER FATHER ENTERED AND CARLTON LEFT THE ROOM DEAR PAPA
TAKE HER ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES AND HE RECEIVED HER BY SAYING I TAKE HER ACCORDING TO THAT LAW SOME BLESSINGS WERE THEN PRONOUNCED ON THE YOUNG COUPLE BOTH BY THE PARENTS AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY THE BLESSINGS OR PRAYERS GENERALLY RUN IN THIS STYLE
SO IT IS YOU CRIED THE HERDSMAN WHEN HE HAD RECEIVED THE MESSAGE
AND HENCE PERHAPS THE WORDS IN OUR MARRIAGE CEREMONY I THEE ENDOW THE THIRD KIND OF MARRIAGE WAS WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN HAVING COHABITED FOR SOME TIME AND HAD CHILDREN FOUND IT EXPEDIENT TO CONTINUE TOGETHER
AND WE ARE WELL ASSURED THAT IN GERMANY THERE ARE MANY WOMEN WHO DO HONOR TO HUMANITY NOT BY CHASTITY ONLY BUT ALSO BY A VARIETY OF OTHER VIRTUES THE LADIES AT THE PRINCIPAL COURTS DIFFER NOT MUCH IN THEIR DRESS FROM THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HEARD SOUNDS OF BELLOWING AND I THOUGHT I RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF THE GOLDEN HORNED OX BUT WHEN I GOT TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THE SOUNDS HAD COME I COULD NEITHER SEE NOR HEAR ANYTHING IN THE HOLE ITSELF
WHO HAST ORDAINED FOR THEM LOVE JOY TENDERNESS PEACE AND MUTUAL AFFECTION BE PLEASED TO BLESS NOT ONLY THIS COUPLE BUT JUDAH AND JERUSALEM WITH SONGS OF JOY AND PRAISE FOR THE JOY THAT THOU GIVEST THEM BY THE MULTITUDES OF THEIR SONS AND OF THEIR DAUGHTERS
FOR A LONG WHILE THE OLD MAN REFUSED TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH SUCH A WICKED SCHEME BUT HIS SON TALKED HIM OVER IN THE END AND THEY KILLED THE OXEN AS THEY HAD KILLED THE SHEEP AND THE PIGS LAST OF ALL THEY CAME TO THE KING'S CHERISHED OX
SHE MADE NO OBJECTION AND I AM THEREFORE I THINK JUSTIFIED IN CONSIDERING THAT IF YOU AUTHORISED THE REMOVAL OF SCRUPLES WHICH DO HER HONOUR AT PRESENT SHE WOULD NOT FEEL THE DELICACY SHE DOES NOW AT SANCTIONING MY ADDRESSES
NOT ENTIRELY A STRANGER SIR IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO SAY SO INDEED I HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE SIR AND PROFIT AND
NOW ALTHOUGH IN SO MANY WORDS SHE DIRECTLY DISCOURAGED ME IT IS HER DUE THAT I SHOULD SAY THIS STILL I THINK I MAY WITHOUT VANITY VENTURE TO HOPE THAT SHE DID SO AS A MATTER OF DUTY MORE THAN AS A MATTER OF INCLINATION
AFTER MARRIAGE WHEN OPPOSITION COULD NO LONGER BE OF ANY AVAIL IT WOULD BE QUITE A DIFFERENT THING WE MIGHT BE SURE OF PRODUCING SOONER OR LATER THE MOST FAVOURABLE RESULTS
BESIDES WHAT I HAD OBSERVED OF MARGARET'S FATHER ESPECIALLY DURING THE LATTER PART OF MY INTERVIEW WITH HIM SHOWED ME PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT HE WAS TRYING TO CONCEAL UNDER EXAGGERATED SURPRISE AND ASSUMED HESITATION HIS SECRET DESIRE TO PROFIT AT ONCE BY MY OFFER
THE FETTERS OF CONCEALMENT FORCED ON ME BY THE PROPOSALS THEMSELVES WHICH NOW HUNG HEAVY ON MY HEART THAT EVENING I LEFT EWELL AND RODE TOWARDS HOME AGAIN AS FAR AS RICHMOND WHERE I REMAINED FOR THE NIGHT AND THE FOREPART OF THE NEXT DAY
AND CAME TO THE POINT ABRUPTLY CAME TO BUSINESS AS HE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN PLAINER MISTER SHERWIN I OUGHT PERHAPS TO HAVE TOLD YOU AT THE OUTSET IN SO MANY WORDS THAT I CAME TO
I FELT SOME DIFFICULTY IN OPENING MY BUSINESS TO HIM IT WAS NECESSARY TO SPEAK HOWEVER AT ONCE I BEGAN WITH AN APOLOGY I AM AFRAID MISTER SHERWIN THAT THIS INTRUSION ON THE PART OF A PERFECT STRANGER
OF A DISPOSITION FULL OF MODEST GENEROSITIES AND MEEK SYMPATHIES WHICH HAD BEEN CRUSHED DOWN PAST ROUSING TO SELF ASSERTION PAST EVER SEEING THE LIGHT THERE IN THAT MILD WAN FACE OF HERS
THE SHOWY WINDOW CURTAINS OF WHITE AND SKY BLUE AND THE STILL SHOWIER CARPET OF RED AND YELLOW SEEMED AS IF THEY HAD COME OUT OF THE SHOP YESTERDAY THE ROUND ROSEWOOD TABLE WAS IN A PAINFULLY HIGH STATE OF POLISH THE MOROCCO BOUND PICTURE BOOKS THAT LAY ON IT
AND WAS VERY MUCH TO BE EXPECTED VERY MUCH INDEED HE HAS EXPRESSED NO DISAPPROVAL MISTER SHERWIN YOU DON'T SAY SO I HAVE NOT GIVEN HIM AN OPPORTUNITY
TO WHICH WE CAN ASSIGN NO PARTICULAR PLACE OR CAUSE ABSENT FROM MARGARET I HAD NO RESOURCE AGAINST THE OPPRESSION THAT NOW OVERCAME ME I COULD ONLY ENDEAVOUR TO ALLEVIATE IT BY KEEPING INCESSANTLY IN ACTION BY WALKING OR RIDING
THE MOUTH AND THE MUSCLES OF THE CHEEK HIS HAIR HAD BEEN BLACK BUT WAS NOW TURNING TO A SORT OF IRON GREY
SAID MISSUS SHERWIN ALMOST INAUDIBLY LOOKING AS SHE SPOKE WITH ANXIOUS EYES TOWARDS HER HUSBAND TO SEE IF SHE WAS JUSTIFIED IN UTTERING EVEN THOSE PITEOUSLY COMMON PLACE WORDS VERY BEAUTIFUL WEATHER TO BE SURE CONTINUED THE POOR WOMAN
MOST BECOMING INDEED ON THE PART OF YOUR RESPECTED FATHER I HONOUR HIS CONVICTIONS SIR SUCH ESTATES SUCH HOUSES SUCH A FAMILY AS HIS CONNECTED I BELIEVE WITH THE NOBILITY ESPECIALLY ON YOUR LATE LAMENTED MOTHER'S SIDE
I SINCERELY FELT FOR HER BUT COULD SAY NOTHING IN THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT I ROSE TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR HER AND IMMEDIATELY REPENTED HAVING DONE SO THE ACTION ADDED SO MUCH TO HER EMBARRASSMENT THAT SHE KICKED HER FOOT AGAINST A CHAIR
AS I THOUGHT ON WHAT I HAD DONE I FELT A SENSE OF HUMILIATION WHICH WAS ALMOST PUNISHMENT ENOUGH FOR THE MEANNESS OF WHICH I HAD BEEN GUILTY I WENT ROUND TO THE STABLES AND HAD MY HORSE SADDLED IMMEDIATELY
IN THOSE PAINFUL STARTINGS AND HURRYINGS WHEN SHE MOVED IN THAT TREMULOUS FAINT UTTERANCE WHEN SHE SPOKE THERE I COULD SEE ONE OF THOSE GHASTLY HEART TRAGEDIES LAID OPEN BEFORE ME WHICH ARE ACTED AND RE ACTED SCENE BY SCENE
A GREAT STICKLER FOR THE CONVENTIONAL RESPECTABILITIES OF LIFE AND A GREAT BELIEVER IN HIS OWN INFALLIBILITY BUT HE WAS MARGARET'S FATHER AND I WAS DETERMINED TO BE PLEASED WITH HIM HE MADE ME A LOW AND RATHER A CRINGING BOW
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY TO ASK YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAND IN MARRIAGE BUT A THOUGHT OF MY FATHER MOVED DARKLY OVER MY MIND AT THAT MOMENT AND THE WORDS WOULD NOT PASS MY LIPS WELL SIR TO WHAT THE TONE IN WHICH HE SAID THIS WAS HARSH ENOUGH TO ROUSE ME
NOT ONE LEAF EVEN OF THE MUSIC ON THE PIANO WAS DOGS EARED OR WORN NEVER WAS A RICHLY FURNISHED ROOM MORE THOROUGHLY COMFORTLESS THAN THIS THE EYE ACHED AT LOOKING ROUND IT THERE WAS NO REPOSE ANYWHERE
HE STOPPED HALF BREATHLESS BENDING FORWARD TOWARDS ME AND CRUMPLING MY CARD BETWEEN HIS FINGERS INTO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE DIMENSIONS
NO ENTREATIES OF MINE OR OF ANY ONE BELONGING TO ME WOULD INDUCE HIM TO GIVE HIS SANCTION TO THE MARRIAGE I HAVE COME TO YOU TO PROPOSE BLESS MY SOUL THIS IS CARRYING THINGS RATHER FAR THOUGH
THEN LOOKED TO THE WINDOW AND SEEING THE CARRIAGE WAITING FOR ME AT HIS DOOR MADE ANOTHER BOW AND INSISTED ON RELIEVING ME OF MY HAT WITH HIS OWN HAND THIS DONE HE COUGHED AND BEGGED TO KNOW WHAT HE COULD DO FOR ME
MISTER SHERWIN COUGHED IT WAS EVIDENTLY A WARNING MATRIMONIAL PEAL THAT HE HAD OFTEN RUNG BEFORE FOR MISSUS SHERWIN STARTED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM DIRECTLY
A LITTLE CONSIDERATION AND A LITTLE TALK WITH MY DEAR GIRL
BEFORE HE HAD BEEN IN IT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR I WAS NOT KEPT WAITING LONG ANOTHER VIOLENT CRACK FROM THE NEW DOOR ANNOUNCED THE ENTRANCE OF MISTER SHERWIN HIMSELF HE WAS A TALL THIN MAN RATHER ROUND SHOULDERED
IN CONFIDENCE HOW I AM SITUATED WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSALS I HAVE MADE THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES YES YES HE BENT FORWARD AGAIN EAGERLY TOWARDS ME AS HE SPOKE
EVEN IF I COULD HAVE DONE SO I WOULD NOT HAVE RECALLED WHAT I HAD JUST SAID BUT STILL I TREMBLED IN SPITE OF MYSELF AS I EXPRESSED IN PLAIN BLUNT WORDS WHAT I HAD ONLY RAPTUROUSLY THOUGHT OVER OR DELICATELY HINTED AT TO MARGARET UP TO THIS TIME
HE SAID INDIGNANTLY WHAT IS THERE TO CRY ABOUT
RATHER MORE THAN A WEEK AGO I CONTINUED I ACCIDENTALLY MET MISS SHERWIN IN AN OMNIBUS ACCOMPANIED BY A LADY OLDER THAN HERSELF MY WIFE MISSUS SHERWIN HE SAID IMPATIENTLY MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND
HIS COMPLEXION TURNED YELLOWER HE DROPPED MY CARD WHICH HE HAD BY THIS TIME CRUSHED INTO FRAGMENTS AND RAN HIS HAND RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS HAIR UNTIL HE HAD STRETCHED IT OUT LIKE A PENTHOUSE OVER HIS FOREHEAD BLINKING ALL THE TIME AND REGARDING ME
THE PRINT OF THE QUEEN HANGING LONELY ON THE WALL IN ITS HEAVY GILT FRAME WITH A LARGE CROWN AT THE TOP GLARED ON YOU THE PAPER THE CURTAINS THE CARPET GLARED ON YOU THE BOOKS THE WAX FLOWERS IN GLASS CASES
NO IDEA OF PROCEEDING IN ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION OCCURRED TO ME I SIMPLY FELT RESOLVED TO PASS MY TWO DAYS ORDEAL OF SUSPENSE AWAY FROM HOME FAR ENOUGH AWAY TO KEEP ME FAITHFUL TO MY PROMISE NOT TO SEE MARGARET SOON AFTER I STARTED
MISSUS SHERWIN COUGHED A VERY WEAK SMALL COUGH HALF STIFLED IN ITS BIRTH
I HAVE INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS MISTER SHERWIN IN MANY DIRECTIONS THERE ARE APPOINTMENTS GOOD APPOINTMENTS WHICH WOULD BE OPEN TO ME IF I PUSHED MY INTERESTS I MIGHT PROVIDE IN THIS WAY AGAINST THE CHANCE OF FAILURE
WITH A LOWERING SINISTER EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE I SAW THAT IT WAS USELESS TO TREAT HIM AS I SHOULD HAVE TREATED A GENTLEMAN HE HAD EVIDENTLY PUT THE MEANEST AND THE FOULEST CONSTRUCTION UPON MY DELICACY AND HESITATION IN SPEAKING TO HIM SO I ALTERED MY PLAN
I REACHED LONDON IN THE AFTERNOON AND GOT TO NORTH VILLA WITHOUT GOING HOME FIRST ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK THE OPPRESSION WAS STILL ON MY SPIRITS EVEN THE SIGHT OF THE HOUSE WHERE MARGARET LIVED FAILED TO INVIGORATE OR AROUSE ME
IS HE A YOUNG MAN YOUNG OH DEAR NO MISTER MANNION IS FORTY OR A YEAR OR TWO MORE IF HE'S A DAY AN ADMIRABLE MAN OF BUSINESS AS WELL AS A GREAT SCHOLAR
AND HAD BEEN ORDERED TO SAY HER FIRST LESSON IN A STRANGER'S PRESENCE DELIGHTFUL WEATHER MISSUS SHERWIN I HAVE BEEN ENJOYING IT FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS IN THE COUNTRY IN A PART OF SURREY THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF EWELL THAT I HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE THERE WAS A PAUSE
AS IF MISSUS SHERWIN WERE SOME INSIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO THE CONVERSATION WHICH HE WISHED TO CLEAR OUT OF THE WAY AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
THIS IS WHY IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO KEEP OUR UNION SECRET AT FIRST I WONDERED THEN I HAVE SINCE WONDERED MORE HOW IT WAS THAT I CONTRIVED TO SPEAK THUS
MY DEAR SIR I EMPHATICALLY REPEAT IT YOUR FATHER'S CONVICTIONS DO HIM HONOUR I RESPECT THEM AS MUCH AS I RESPECT HIM I DO INDEED I AM GLAD YOU CAN VIEW MY FATHER'S IDEAS ON SOCIAL SUBJECTS IN SO FAVOURABLE A LIGHT MISTER SHERWIN
I LEFT MY HORSE TO HIS OWN GUIDANCE AND GAVE MYSELF UP TO MY THOUGHTS AND RECOLLECTIONS AS ONE BY ONE THEY ROSE WITHIN ME THE ANIMAL TOOK THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD BEEN OFTENEST USED TO TAKE DURING MY RESIDENCE IN LONDON THE NORTHERN ROAD
THAT A PRIVATE MARRIAGE GIVES US A CHANCE FOR THE FUTURE AS OPPORTUNITIES ARISE OF GRADUALLY DISCLOSING IT MY OFFER TO YOU MAY BE MADE UNDER SOME DISADVANTAGES AND DIFFICULTIES PERHAPS
IMPERCEPTIBLY DIFFUSES HER HAPPINESS AROUND HER SHE HAS AN INFLUENCE THAT IS SOMETHING AKIN TO THE INFLUENCE OF A SUNSHINY DAY SO AGAIN THE MELANCHOLY OF A MELANCHOLY WOMAN IS INVARIABLY THOUGH SILENTLY INFECTIOUS
I RODE AS FAR AS EWELL AND STOPPED THERE THE DARKNESS HAD OVERTAKEN ME AND IT WAS USELESS TO TIRE MY HORSE BY GOING ON ANY GREATER DISTANCE THE NEXT MORNING I WAS UP ALMOST WITH SUNRISE AND PASSED THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY IN WALKING ABOUT AMONG VILLAGES LANES AND FIELDS
THERE MIGHT BE MANY CHANCES FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE MARRIAGE WAS SOLEMNISED I MIGHT INTRODUCE YOUR DAUGHTER TO MY FATHER'S NOTICE WITHOUT DISCLOSING WHO SHE WAS AND LEAVE HER GRADUALLY AND UNSUSPECTEDLY
VERY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE I HAPPEN TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE STEWARD OF YOUR RESPECTED FATHER HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO WALK THROUGH THE ROOMS A TREAT QUITE AN INTELLECTUAL TREAT THE FURNITURE AND HANGINGS AND SO ON ARRANGED IN SUCH A CHASTE STYLE AND
TO FOLLOW THE FAVOURITE ROAD WHICH I HAD SO OFTEN FOLLOWED WITH CLARA TO STOP PERHAPS AT SOME PLACE WHERE I HAD OFTEN STOPPED WITH HER WAS MORE THAN I HAD THE COURAGE OR THE INSENSIBILITY TO DO AT THAT MOMENT
YOU WILL BE LESS SURPRISED TO HEAR HOW THEY ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT ME IN THE STEP I AM NOW TAKING HE DISAPPROVES OF IT OF COURSE STRONGLY PERHAPS
HER FRENCH AND ITALIAN AND GERMAN NOT DISCONTINUED IN HOLIDAYS OR AFTER SHE LEFT SCHOOL SHE HAS ONLY JUST LEFT IT
MAY I ASK WHO MISTER MANNION IS THE TONE IN WHICH I PUT THIS QUESTION COOLED HIS ENTHUSIASM ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S EDUCATION IMMEDIATELY HE ANSWERED IN HIS FORMER TONES AND WITH ONE OF HIS FORMER BOWS
MOST DECIDEDLY SO I AM NOT INSENSIBLE MY DEAR SIR TO THE GREAT ADVANTAGE AND HONOUR AND SO FORTH BUT THERE IS SOMETHING SO UNUSUAL ABOUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR
MY MEETING WITH YOUR DAUGHTER HAS BEEN KEPT A PROFOUND SECRET FROM HIM AND FROM EVERY MEMBER OF MY FAMILY AND A SECRET IT MUST REMAIN I SPEAK FROM MY INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF MY FATHER WHEN I SAY THAT I HARDLY KNOW OF ANY MEANS THAT HE WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF EMPLOYING
HE RAN HIS FINGERS RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS HAIR AND TRIED TO LOOK INDEPENDENT STILL I AM PREPARED TO ADMIT UNDER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES I SAY UNDER ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HIS DISAPPROVAL IS VERY NATURAL
THE IMPRESSION SHE MADE ON ME WAS SOMETHING MORE HOWEVER THAN A MERE MOMENTARY FEELING OF ADMIRATION
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE WORLD TO HAVE HAD HIS BACK TURNED BEFORE I SPOKE TO HIM AGAIN I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT MY FAMILY AND MY NAME ARE NOT UNKNOWN TO YOU MISTER SHERWIN I RESUMED
AND MISSUS SHERWIN WAS ONE OF THIS LATTER ORDER HER PALE SICKLY MOIST LOOKING SKIN HER LARGE MILD WATERY LIGHT BLUE EYES THE RESTLESS TIMIDITY OF HER EXPRESSION
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I SHALL FEEL LESS HESITATION AND DIFFICULTY IN MAKING YOU ACQUAINTED WITH THE OBJECT OF MY VISIT
AND PART OF IT PROJECTED ALMOST HORIZONTALLY OVER HIS FOREHEAD HE HAD A HABIT OF STRETCHING IT IN THIS DIRECTION BY IRRITABLY COMBING IT OUT FROM TIME TO TIME WITH HIS FINGERS HIS LIPS WERE THIN AND COLOURLESS
SAID YOUR GOOD HEALTH SIR YOUR VERY GOOD HEALTH
ON THIS OCCASION WHEN I WAS SHOWN INTO THE DRAWING ROOM BOTH MISTER AND MISSUS SHERWIN WERE AWAITING ME THERE ON THE TABLE WAS THE SHERRY WHICH HAD BEEN SO PERSEVERINGLY PRESSED ON ME AT THE LAST INTERVIEW AND BY IT A NEW POUND CAKE
WHICH WHATEVER CONDITIONS MIGHT CLOG IT WAS INFINITELY MORE ADVANTAGEOUS IN A SOCIAL POINT OF VIEW THAN ANY HE COULD HAVE HOPED FOR IT WAS NOT HIS DELAY IN ACCEPTING MY PROPOSALS BUT THE BURDEN OF DECEIT
AND TO CONSIDER YOUR PROPOSALS WHICH HAVE TAKEN ME VERY MUCH BY SURPRISE AS YOU MAY IN FACT SEE BUT I ASSURE YOU I AM MOST FLATTERED MOST HONOURED MOST ANXIOUS I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER MY ANXIETIES MISTER SHERWIN
LEAVING THE KNIFE STICKING IN THE CAKE UPON WHICH MISTER SHERWIN WITH A STERN LOOK AT HER OSTENTATIOUSLY PULLED IT OUT AND SET IT DOWN RATHER VIOLENTLY ON THE DISH POOR MISSUS SHERWIN
MISTER SHERWIN HELPED HIMSELF TO A SECOND GLASS OF WINE WITHOUT TAKING THE SMALLEST NOTICE OF THIS I HOPE MISSUS SHERWIN HAS NOT HURT HERSELF I SAID OH DEAR NO NOT WORTH A MOMENT'S THOUGHT AWKWARDNESS AND NERVOUSNESS NOTHING ELSE SHE ALWAYS WAS NERVOUS THE DOCTORS ALL HUMBUGS
JUST AS CHANCE LED ME DURING THE NIGHT MANY THOUGHTS THAT I HAD BANISHED FOR THE LAST WEEK HAD RETURNED THOSE THOUGHTS OF EVIL OMEN UNDER WHICH THE MIND SEEMS TO ACHE JUST AS THE BODY ACHES UNDER A DULL HEAVY PAIN
I MUST ALSO BEG YOU TO SUSPEND YOUR JUDGMENT UNTIL YOU HAVE HEARD ME TO THE END YOU MAY BE DISPOSED TO VIEW TO VIEW
IN ALL CANDOUR AND HONESTY THAT THE IMPRESSION MISS SHERWIN PRODUCED ON ME WAS SUCH AS TO MAKE ME DESIRE THE PRIVILEGE OF BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH HER IN PLAIN WORDS I DISCOVERED HER PLACE OF RESIDENCE BY FOLLOWING HER TO THIS HOUSE
THE MIXTURE OF USELESS HESITATION AND INVOLUNTARY RAPIDITY IN EVERY ONE OF HER ACTIONS ALL FURNISHED THE SAME SIGNIFICANT BETRAYAL OF A LIFE OF INCESSANT FEAR AND RESTRAINT
IN SHORT OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN THEIR RANK EXACTLY BUT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION QUITE A MISUNDERSTANDING EXTREMELY STUPID OF ME TO BE SURE PRAY LET ME OFFER YOU A GLASS OF WINE
I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT I THINK WE ARE WANDERING AWAY FROM THE POINT A LITTLE I BEG YOURS SO WE ARE WELL MY DEAR SIR I MUST BE ALLOWED A DAY OR TWO SAY TWO DAYS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT MY DAUGHTER'S FEELINGS ARE
THAT THE DECANTER TINKLED ALL THE WHILE AGAINST THE GLASS THOUGH I WANTED NOTHING I ATE AND DRANK SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY IN COMMON CONSIDERATION FOR MISSUS SHERWIN'S EMBARRASSMENT MISTER SHERWIN FILLED HIMSELF A GLASS HELD IT UP ADMIRINGLY TO THE LIGHT
IT WAS NOT UNTIL I HAD RIDDEN HALF A MILE BEYOND THE SUBURBS THAT I LOOKED ROUND ME AND DISCOVERED TOWARDS WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY I WAS PROCEEDING I DREW THE REIN DIRECTLY AND TURNED MY HORSE'S HEAD BACK AGAIN
TO FRUSTRATE THE PURPOSE OF THIS VISIT IF I HAD MENTIONED IT TO HIM HE HAS BEEN THE KINDEST AND BEST OF FATHERS TO ME BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IF I WAITED FOR HIS CONSENT
HERE MISSUS SHERWIN PUT HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES QUITE NOISELESSLY FOR SHE HAD DOUBTLESS ACQUIRED BY LONG PRACTICE THE HABIT OF WEEPING IN SILENCE HER HUSBAND'S QUICK GLANCE TURNED ON HER HOWEVER IMMEDIATELY
I AM SURE MISTER SHERWIN A SCHOOL SIR WHERE IT WAS A RULE TO TAKE IN NO THING LOWER THAN THE DAUGHTER OF A PROFESSIONAL MAN THEY ONLY WAIVED THE RULE IN MY CASE THE MOST GENTEEL SCHOOL PERHAPS IN ALL LONDON A DRAWING ROOM DEPORTMENT DAY ONCE EVERY WEEK
WELL SIR THE EVENING AFTER YOU LEFT ME I HAD WHAT YOU MAY CALL AN EXPLANATION WITH MY DEAR GIRL
YOU HAVE HEARD OF SUCH A THING AS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT MISTER SHERWIN IN BOOKS SIR HE TAPPED ONE OF THE MOROCCO BOUND VOLUMES ON THE TABLE AND SMILED A CURIOUS SMILE PARTLY DEFERENTIAL AND PARTLY SARCASTIC
TO HAVE A GENTLEMAN OF YOUR BIRTH AND BREEDING FOR A SON IN LAW IS OF COURSE BUT THEN THERE IS THE MONEY QUESTION SUPPOSE YOU FAILED WITH YOUR FATHER AFTER ALL MY MONEY IS OUT IN MY SPECULATIONS I CAN DO NOTHING
I CAN ONLY ASSURE YOU THAT MY ATTACHMENT TO MISS SHERWIN IS NOT OF A NATURE TO BE OVERCOME BY ANY PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS I SPEAK IN ALL OUR INTERESTS WHEN I SAY
TO PRACTISE THE GIRLS WITH THE FOOTMAN OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IN ATTENDANCE IN GETTING INTO A CARRIAGE AND GETTING OUT AGAIN IN A LADY LIKE MANNER NO DUCHESS HAS HAD A BETTER EDUCATION THAN MY MARGARET PERMIT ME TO ASSURE YOU MISTER SHERWIN AND THEN HER KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES
HIGHLY INDEED MY DEAR SIR DON'T SUPPOSE FOR ONE MOMENT I EVER DOUBTED YOUR HONOURABLE FEELING
I HAD HARDLY NOTICED HER ON THE DAY WHEN SHE GOT INTO THE OMNIBUS WITH HER DAUGHTER IT WAS AS IF I NOW SAW HER FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE IS A NATURAL COMMUNICATIVENESS ABOUT WOMEN'S EMOTIONS A HAPPY WOMAN
EVERYTHING WAS OPPRESSIVELY NEW THE BRILLIANTLY VARNISHED DOOR CRACKED WITH A REPORT LIKE A PISTOL WHEN IT WAS OPENED THE PAPER ON THE WALLS WITH ITS GAUDY PATTERN OF BIRDS TRELLIS WORK AND FLOWERS IN GOLD RED AND GREEN ON A WHITE GROUND LOOKED HARDLY DRY YET
TO WIN HIS AFFECTION AND RESPECT AS WITH HER BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND AMIABILITY SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO DO WHILE I WAITED UNTIL THE OCCASION WAS RIPE FOR CONFESSING EVERYTHING THEN IF I SAID TO HIM
THAT COULD HARDLY HAPPEN I THINK WITH HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND EDUCATION AND MANNERS TOO SO DISTINGUISHED THOUGH PERHAPS I OUGHT NOT TO SAY SO
I WAITED TILL SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN LEFT THE HOUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER AVOIDED MY SISTER MY SISTER WHO HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE ASKED A QUESTION OR UTTERED A WORD THAT COULD ANNOY ME MY SISTER WHO HAD CONFIDED
HIS WIFE TO WHOM HE OFFERED NOTHING LOOKED AT HIM ALL THE TIME WITH THE MOST REVERENTIAL ATTENTION YOU ARE TAKING NOTHING YOURSELF MISSUS SHERWIN I SAID
YOU WOULD BE INCLINED TO LAUGH I DARE SAY IF I ASKED YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT OUT OF BOOKS BUT WITHOUT DWELLING FURTHER ON THAT IT IS MY DUTY TO CONFESS TO YOU
CAN DO NOTHING WITH HER IT'S VERY SAD VERY SAD INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT BY THIS TIME IN SPITE OF ALL MY EFFORTS TO PRESERVE SOME RESPECT FOR HIM AS MARGARET'S FATHER HE HAD SUNK TO HIS PROPER PLACE IN MY ESTIMATION WELL MY DEAR SIR HE RESUMED
MAY BE CONSIDERED STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL I AM SURE I CAN DEPEND ON YOUR FAVOURING ME THUS FAR CERTAINLY MOST CERTAINLY THE STRICTEST SECRECY OF COURSE PRAY GO ON HE DREW HIS CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER TO ME
THIS SHERRY STANDS ME IN SIX SHILLINGS A BOTTLE OUGHT TO BE FIRST RATE WINE AT THAT PRICE AND SO IT IS WELL IF YOU WON'T HAVE ANY MORE WE WILL PROCEED TO BUSINESS HA HA BUSINESS AS I CALL IT
NO AGAIN VERY WELL THEN THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AT FIVE O'CLOCK WITH A LOUDER CRACK THAN EVER THE BRAND NEW DRAWING ROOM DOOR WAS OPENED TO LET ME OUT THE NOISE WAS INSTANTLY SUCCEEDED BY THE RUSTLING OF A SILK DRESS AND THE BANGING OF ANOTHER DOOR AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE PASSAGE
IN THE SECRET THEATRE OF HOME TRAGEDIES WHICH ARE EVER SHADOWED BY THE SLOW FALLING OF THE BLACK CURTAIN THAT DROPS LOWER AND LOWER EVERY DAY THAT DROPS TO HIDE ALL AT LAST FROM THE HAND OF DEATH
LOOKING MORE INQUISITIVE AND MORE CUNNING THAN EVER I HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED TO YOU MISTER SHERWIN THAT I HAVE FOUND MEANS TO SPEAK TO YOUR DAUGHTER
A PROFOUND SECRET AMONG OURSELVES UNTIL I CAN DIVULGE MY MARRIAGE TO MY FATHER WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF BUT I TELL YOU SIR I CAN'T SEE MY WAY THROUGH IT AT ALL CHANCE WHAT CHANCE WOULD THERE BE AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME
MISSUS SHERWIN WAS CUTTING THE CAKE AS I CAME IN WHILE HER HUSBAND WATCHED THE PROCESS WITH CRITICAL EYES THE POOR WOMAN'S WEAK WHITE FINGERS TREMBLED AS THEY MOVED THE KNIFE UNDER CONJUGAL INSPECTION
WE MUST KEEP BOTH THE COURTSHIP AND THE MARRIAGE SECRET SECRET GOOD GRACIOUS I DON'T AT ALL SEE MY WAY YES SECRET
FOR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY SMALL INDEPENDENCE LEFT ME BY MY MOTHER I HAVE NO CERTAIN PROSPECTS BUT I REALLY THINK MY PROPOSALS HAVE SOME COMPENSATING ADVANTAGES TO RECOMMEND THEM CERTAINLY
NOT ONLY HIS EYES BUT HIS WHOLE FACE SEEMED TO BE NERVOUSLY BLINKING AND WINKING ALL THE TIME HE WAS ADDRESSING ME IN THE EMBARRASSMENT AND ANXIETY WHICH I THEN FELT THIS PECULIARITY FIDGETTED AND BEWILDERED ME MORE THAN I CAN DESCRIBE
AND WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN I HEARD THE LIBRARY DOOR OPEN I INSTANTLY DREW BACK AND HALF CLOSED MY OWN DOOR AGAIN CLARA HAD GOT THE BOOK SHE WANTED AND WAS TAKING IT UP TO HER OWN SITTING ROOM
UPON MY SOUL THIS IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY PROCEEDING PRAY HEAR ME OUT MISTER SHERWIN YOU WILL NOT CONDEMN MY CONDUCT I THINK IF YOU HEAR ALL I HAVE TO SAY HE MUTTERED SOMETHING UNINTELLIGIBLE
MISTER MANNION IS MY CONFIDENTIAL CLERK SIR
WEAK AT THE KNEES AND TRYING TO CONCEAL THE WEAKNESS IN THE BREADTH OF HIS TROWSERS HE WORE A WHITE CRAVAT AND AN ABSURDLY HIGH SHIRT COLLAR HIS COMPLEXION WAS SALLOW HIS EYES WERE SMALL BLACK BRIGHT AND INCESSANTLY IN MOTION
NO DOUBT THAT WAS ONE REASON WHY SHE RECEIVED ME AS SHE DID BUT SHE HAD ANOTHER WHICH SHE COMMUNICATED TO ME IN THE PLAINEST TERMS THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR RANK OF LIFE
AND BETWEEN THAT TIME AND THIS YOU WILL ENGAGE NOT TO HOLD ANY COMMUNICATION WITH MY DAUGHTER I PROMISE NOT MISTER SHERWIN BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT YOUR ANSWER WILL BE FAVOURABLE
YES YES HIGH PRINCIPLES SIR HIGH PRINCIPLES THANK GOD
THE PICTURES SOME OF THE FINEST PIECES I EVER SAW I WAS DELIGHTED QUITE DELIGHTED INDEED HE SPOKE IN UNDER TONES LAYING GREAT STRESS UPON PARTICULAR WORDS THAT WERE EVIDENTLY FAVOURITES WITH HIM SUCH AS INDEED
THANK YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE MISTER SHERWIN I HAVE REASONS FOR WISHING THAT THIS INTERVIEW
IF ON THE OTHER HAND I COULD ONLY SAY THIS YOUNG LADY IS ABOUT TO BECOME MY WIFE HIS PREJUDICES WOULD ASSUREDLY INDUCE HIM TO RECALL HIS MOST FAVOURABLE IMPRESSIONS AND REFUSE HIS CONSENT IN SHORT MISTER SHERWIN BEFORE MARRIAGE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE HIM
ALL SURROUNDING OBJECTS SEEMED STARTLINGLY NEAR TO THE EYE MUCH NEARER THAN THEY REALLY WERE
MOST HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN MOST HAPPY INDEED MY DEAR SIR SAID MISTER SHERWIN ADVANCING WITH HOSPITABLE SMILE AND OUTSTRETCHED HAND ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MY BETTER HALF MISSUS S HIS WIFE ROSE IN A HURRY AND CURTSEYED
RATTLING A BUNCH OF KEYS IN HIS POCKET WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONSIDERABLE PERPLEXITY
AS THE LADY OF THE HOUSE MISSUS S IT STRIKES ME THAT YOU MIGHT OFFER A VISITOR LIKE THIS GENTLEMAN SOME CAKE AND WINE WITHOUT MAKING ANY PARTICULAR HOLE IN YOUR MANNERS
IT GAVE ME BACK MY SELF POSSESSION IMMEDIATELY TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO PAY MY ADDRESSES TO MISS SHERWIN OR TO BE PLAINER STILL IF YOU LIKE TO ASK OF YOU HER HAND IN MARRIAGE THE WORDS WERE SPOKEN
IT IS EXACTLY THERE THAT THE DIFFICULTY LIES MY FATHER ON WHOM I AM DEPENDENT AS THE YOUNGER SON HAS VERY STRONG PREJUDICES CONVICTIONS I OUGHT PERHAPS TO CALL THEM ON THE SUBJECT OF SOCIAL INEQUALITIES QUITE SO MOST NATURAL
VERY PROPER A VERY PROPER WAY OF PUTTING IT PRACTICAL IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO SAY SO
AND INQUIRED WHETHER HE SHOULD TELL HER THAT I HAD COME IN I DESIRED HIM NOT TO DISTURB HER AS IT WAS MY INTENTION TO GO OUT AGAIN IMMEDIATELY I WENT INTO MY STUDY AND WROTE A SHORT NOTE THERE TO CLARA MERELY TELLING HER THAT I SHOULD BE ABSENT IN THE COUNTRY FOR TWO DAYS
THIS IS A MOST ANNOYING CIRCUMSTANCE AND BEFORE A VISITOR TOO YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME TO DISCUSS THE MATTER ALONE YOU ALWAYS WERE IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS AND IT'S MY OPINION YOU ALWAYS WILL BE MISSUS SHERWIN PREPARED WITHOUT A WORD OF REMONSTRANCE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
AND NO ONE APPARENTLY NEEDED HIM HE QUIETLY SLIPPED AWAY INTO THE LITTLE ROOM WHERE THE REFRESHMENTS WERE AND AGAIN HAD A GREAT SENSE OF COMFORT WHEN HE SAW THE WAITERS THE LITTLE OLD WAITER PRESSED HIM TO HAVE SOMETHING AND LEVIN AGREED
HOLD THEIR DUTY AS SACRED AND VINDICATE THE EXALTED CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WITH HIS SPEECH THE GOVERNOR WALKED OUT OF THE HALL AND THE NOBLEMEN NOISILY AND EAGERLY SOME EVEN ENTHUSIASTICALLY
LEVIN ANXIOUS TO SEE INTO EVERYTHING AND NOT TO MISS ANYTHING STOOD THERE TOO IN THE CROWD AND HEARD THE GOVERNOR SAY PLEASE TELL MARYA IVANOVNA MY WIFE IS VERY SORRY SHE COULDN'T COME TO THE HOME
MADE READY TO SET OFF TO THE ELECTIONS HE INVITED HIS BROTHER WHO HAD A VOTE IN THE SELEZNEVSKY DISTRICT TO COME WITH HIM LEVIN HAD MOREOVER TO TRANSACT IN KASHIN SOME EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUSINESS
I DON'T THINK SO QUITE THE CONTRARY VRONSKY SAID WITH QUIET SURPRISE IT'S A PLAYTHING LEVIN CUT HIM SHORT
URGING THEM TO ELECT THE PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES NOT FROM REGARD FOR PERSONS BUT FOR THE SERVICE AND WELFARE OF THEIR FATHERLAND AND HOPING THAT THE HONORABLE NOBILITY OF THE KASHINSKY PROVINCE WOULD AS AT ALL FORMER ELECTIONS
ON THE FIFTH DAY CAME THE ELECTIONS OF THE DISTRICT MARSHALS
THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE SNETKOV WAS A NOBLEMAN OF THE OLD SCHOOL DISSIPATING AN IMMENSE FORTUNE A GOOD HEARTED MAN HONEST AFTER HIS OWN FASHION
SINCE HIS MARRIAGE THERE HAD BEEN REVEALED TO LEVIN SO MANY NEW AND SERIOUS ASPECTS OF LIFE
AND YOU BEG HIM TO STAND COUNT VRONSKY NOW I'M NOT MAKING A FRIEND OF HIM HE'S ASKED ME TO DINNER AND I'M NOT GOING BUT HE'S ONE OF OUR SIDE WHY MAKE AN ENEMY OF HIM THEN YOU ASK NEVYEDOVSKY IF HE'S GOING TO STAND THAT'S NOT A THING TO DO
THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD NOT VERIFIED THE ACCOUNTS CONSIDERING SUCH A VERIFICATION AN INSULT TO THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE INCAUTIOUSLY ADMITTED THIS THEN A SMALL GENTLEMAN VERY YOUNG LOOKING BUT VERY MALIGNANT
OH THIS IS SUCH AN ORIGINAL FELLOW SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WITH HIS MOST SOOTHING ALMOND OIL SMILE BUT COME ALONG I THINK THEY'RE VOTING AND THEY SEPARATED I CAN'T UNDERSTAND SAID SERGEY IVANOVITCH WHO HAD OBSERVED HIS BROTHER'S CLUMSINESS
WELL NOW IS IT OVER LEVIN ASKED SERGEY IVANOVITCH
AND HE DEVELOPED THIS DILEMMA IN DETAIL SERGEY IVANOVITCH WAS ANSWERED BY THE SPOKESMAN OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY
DELIGHTED I BELIEVE I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING YOU AT PRINCESS SHTCHERBATSKAYA'S HE SAID GIVING LEVIN HIS HAND YES I QUITE REMEMBER OUR MEETING SAID LEVIN AND BLUSHING CRIMSON HE TURNED AWAY IMMEDIATELY AND BEGAN TALKING TO HIS BROTHER
HE FELT SAD HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE ENTRY TO THE GALLERIES HE MET A DEJECTED HIGH SCHOOL BOY WALKING UP AND DOWN WITH TIRED LOOKING EYES
AFTER EATING A CUTLET WITH BEANS AND TALKING TO THE WAITERS OF THEIR FORMER MASTERS LEVIN NOT WISHING TO GO BACK TO THE HALL
FINDING A FREE PLACE LEVIN LEANED OVER THE BALUSTRADE AND BEGAN LOOKING AND LISTENING ALL THE NOBLEMEN WERE SITTING RAILED OFF BEHIND BARRIERS ACCORDING TO THEIR DISTRICTS
PETROVITCH BOL THE VOICE BEGAN AGAIN DECLINED A HIGH BOYISH VOICE REPLIED AGAIN IT BEGAN AND AGAIN DECLINED
THE MARSHAL HAD BEEN VOTED FOR BY A CONSIDERABLE MAJORITY ALL WAS NOISE AND EAGER MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE DOORS SNETKOV CAME IN AND THE NOBLES THRONGED ROUND HIM CONGRATULATING HIM
AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE SIMPLEST THING DONE THAT DEPENDED UPON THE COURT OF WARDSHIP
SERGEY IVANOVITCH ANSWERED OH NO HE'S AN HONEST MAN BUT THOSE OLD FASHIONED METHODS OF PATERNAL FAMILY ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PROVINCIAL AFFAIRS MUST BE BROKEN DOWN
BUT WITH THE HINDRANCES THAT CONFRONTED HIM IN HIS BUSINESS NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN WHY THEY EXISTED BUT LEVIN HAD CHANGED A GOOD DEAL SINCE HIS MARRIAGE
AND THEREUPON THE NOBLES IN HIGH GOOD HUMOR SORTED OUT THEIR FUR COATS AND ALL DROVE OFF TO THE CATHEDRAL IN THE CATHEDRAL LEVIN LIFTING HIS HAND LIKE THE REST AND REPEATING THE WORDS OF THE ARCHDEACON SWORE WITH MOST TERRIBLE OATHS
EVERYONE WAS KIND AND CIVIL BUT THE POINT EVADED SEEMED TO CROP UP AGAIN IN THE END AND AGAIN TO BAR THE WAY WHAT WAS PARTICULARLY TRYING WAS THAT LEVIN COULD NOT MAKE OUT WITH WHOM HE WAS STRUGGLING TO WHOSE INTEREST IT WAS THAT HIS BUSINESS SHOULD NOT BE DONE
SEEMED OF NO IMPORTANCE THAT IN THE QUESTION OF THE ELECTIONS TOO HE ASSUMED AND TRIED TO FIND SOME SERIOUS SIGNIFICANCE SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM THE MEANING AND OBJECT OF THE PROPOSED REVOLUTION AT THE ELECTIONS
LEVIN WAS ON THE STAIRS TO THE WAY OUT AND WAS JUST FEELING IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET FOR THE NUMBER OF HIS OVERCOAT WHEN THE SECRETARY OVERTOOK HIM THIS WAY PLEASE KONSTANTIN DMITRIEVITCH THEY ARE VOTING
THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE DERIVED FROM THEM IN THE WEALTHY KASHINSKY PROVINCE WHICH ALWAYS TOOK THE LEAD OF OTHER PROVINCES IN EVERYTHING THERE WAS NOW SUCH A PREPONDERANCE OF FORCES THAT THIS POLICY ONCE CARRIED THROUGH PROPERLY THERE
JUST AT THE BOX HE CHANGED TO THE LEFT HAND AND UNDOUBTEDLY PUT THE BALL TO THE LEFT AN ADEPT IN THE BUSINESS STANDING AT THE BOX AND SEEING BY THE MERE ACTION OF THE ELBOW WHERE EACH PUT HIS BALL
IN GIVING A PURELY PARTY CHARACTER TO THE DISTRICT COUNCIL WHICH OUGHT BY RIGHTS TO BE OF SUCH AN IMMENSE IMPORTANCE WHAT WAS NEEDED WAS TO PUT IN HIS PLACE A FRESH CAPABLE PERFECTLY MODERN MAN
OH I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL AND IT'S ALL SUCH NONSENSE LEVIN ANSWERED GLOOMILY YOU SAY IT'S ALL SUCH NONSENSE BUT AS SOON AS YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT YOU MAKE A MUDDLE LEVIN DID NOT ANSWER AND THEY WALKED TOGETHER INTO THE BIG ROOM
SEES IT ALL SO CLEARLY OH YES VRONSKY ASSENTED INDIFFERENTLY A SILENCE FOLLOWED DURING WHICH VRONSKY SINCE HE HAD TO LOOK AT SOMETHING LOOKED AT LEVIN AT HIS FEET AT HIS UNIFORM THEN AT HIS FACE
REPLYING FOR SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH A SMILE SOME OTHER CANDIDATE MAY RECEIVE MORE VOTES THAN THE MARSHAL LEVIN HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT NOW HE COULD ONLY REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF TRICKERY IN IT
HIS FACE WAS DREADFUL LOOKING FROM EXHAUSTION AND DISMAY I TOLD YOU NOT TO LET ANY ONE OUT HE CRIED TO THE DOORKEEPER I LET SOMEONE IN YOUR EXCELLENCY MERCY ON US AND WITH A HEAVY SIGH THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE WALKED WITH DOWNCAST HEAD
ON THE FOURTH DAY THE AUDITING OF THE MARSHAL'S ACCOUNTS TOOK PLACE AT THE HIGH TABLE OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE AND THEN THERE OCCURRED THE FIRST SKIRMISH BETWEEN THE NEW PARTY AND THE OLD
IT'S WORTH LOSING ONE'S DINNER HE'S EXQUISITE SO CLEAR AND DISTINCT ALL OF IT THERE'S NOT ONE OF YOU IN THE LAW COURTS THAT SPEAKS LIKE THAT THE ONLY ONE IS MEIDEL AND HE'S NOT SO ELOQUENT BY A LONG WAY
MIGHT SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER PROVINCES FOR ALL RUSSIA
THE DISPOSAL OF LARGE SUMS SUBSCRIBED BY THE NOBILITY OF THE PROVINCE THE HIGH SCHOOLS FEMALE MALE AND MILITARY AND POPULAR INSTRUCTION ON THE NEW MODEL AND FINALLY THE DISTRICT COUNCIL
WAS AT THE ELECTIONS ALL THESE WORRYING NEGOTIATIONS THIS ENDLESS GOING FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND TALKING WITH PLEASANT AND EXCELLENT PEOPLE WHO QUITE SAW THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF THE PETITIONER'S POSITION BUT WERE POWERLESS TO ASSIST HIM ALL THESE EFFORTS THAT YIELDED NO RESULT
CHAPTER TWENTY SIX IN SEPTEMBER LEVIN MOVED TO MOSCOW FOR KITTY'S CONFINEMENT HE HAD SPENT A WHOLE MONTH IN MOSCOW WITH NOTHING TO DO WHEN SERGEY IVANOVITCH WHO HAD PROPERTY IN THE KASHINSKY PROVINCE
THAT ALL WAS IN ORDER THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE GOT UP THANKED THE NOBILITY FOR THEIR CONFIDENCE AND SHED TEARS THE NOBLES GAVE HIM A LOUD WELCOME AND SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM
AND THE FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED AND LEVIN BUSY SEEING AFTER HIS OWN AFFAIRS DID NOT ATTEND THE MEETINGS
GO TO SO AND SO AND SO AND SO AND THE SOLICITOR DREW UP A REGULAR PLAN FOR GETTING ROUND THE FATAL POINT THAT HINDERED EVERYTHING BUT HE WOULD ADD IMMEDIATELY IT'LL MEAN SOME DELAY ANYWAY BUT YOU MIGHT TRY IT AND LEVIN DID TRY AND DID GO
OR BETTER STILL NEVYEDOVSKY A FORMER UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR A MAN OF REMARKABLE INTELLIGENCE AND A GREAT FRIEND OF SERGEY IVANOVITCH THE MEETING WAS OPENED BY THE GOVERNOR WHO MADE A SPEECH TO THE NOBLES
THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IS OVER THIRTY MILES FROM ME FOR SOME MATTER OF TWO ROUBLES I SHOULD HAVE TO SEND A LAWYER WHO COSTS ME FIFTEEN AND HE RELATED HOW A PEASANT HAD STOLEN SOME FLOUR FROM THE MILLER
PROCEEDED TO WALK THROUGH THE GALLERIES THE GALLERIES WERE FULL OF FASHIONABLY DRESSED LADIES LEANING OVER THE BALUSTRADE AND TRYING NOT TO LOSE A SINGLE WORD OF WHAT WAS BEING SAID BELOW
ONE EXPERIENCES IN DREAMS WHEN ONE TRIES TO USE PHYSICAL FORCE HE FELT THIS FREQUENTLY AS HE TALKED TO HIS MOST GOOD NATURED SOLICITOR THIS SOLICITOR DID IT SEEMED EVERYTHING POSSIBLE AND STRAINED EVERY NERVE TO GET HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
RELATING TO THE WARDSHIP OF LAND AND TO THE RECEIVING OF CERTAIN REDEMPTION MONEY FOR HIS SISTER WHO WAS ABROAD LEVIN STILL HESITATED BUT KITTY WHO SAW THAT HE WAS BORED IN MOSCOW AND URGED HIM TO GO ON HER OWN AUTHORITY ORDERED HIM THE PROPER NOBLEMAN'S UNIFORM
FOLLOWED HIM AND THRONGED ROUND HIM WHILE HE PUT ON HIS FUR COAT
LEVIN WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE BALUSTRADE LOOKED AND LISTENED AT FIRST HE WONDERED
THAT NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW THE SOLICITOR CERTAINLY DID NOT KNOW
WELL YOU FIND IT EXCITING TOO SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WINKING AT VRONSKY IT'S SOMETHING LIKE A RACE ONE MIGHT BET ON IT YES IT IS KEENLY EXCITING SAID VRONSKY AND ONCE TAKING THE THING UP ONE'S EAGER TO SEE IT THROUGH
COSTING SEVEN POUNDS AND THAT SEVEN POUNDS PAID FOR THE UNIFORM WAS THE CHIEF CAUSE THAT FINALLY DECIDED LEVIN TO GO HE WENT TO KASHIN
AND THAT MOST LIKELY IT MUST BE SO AND HE TRIED NOT TO FRET IN ATTENDING THE ELECTIONS TOO AND TAKING PART IN THEM
BEGAN TO SAY THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE AGREEABLE TO THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPENDITURES OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS AND THAT THE MISPLACED DELICACY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WAS DEPRIVING HIM OF THIS MORAL SATISFACTION
THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THOUGH HE WAS VAGUELY CONSCIOUS IN THE AIR OF SOME TRAP BEING PREPARED FOR HIM AND THOUGH HE HAD NOT BEEN CALLED UPON BY ALL TO STAND HAD STILL MADE UP HIS MIND TO STAND ALL WAS SILENCE IN THE ROOM
AND HOW SPLENDID THE DISCUSSIONS HAD BEEN IN ONE GROUP LEVIN HEARD HIS BROTHER'S PRAISES ONE LADY WAS TELLING A LAWYER
THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE IN WHOSE HANDS THE LAW HAD PLACED THE CONTROL OF SO MANY IMPORTANT PUBLIC FUNCTIONS THE GUARDIANSHIP OF WARDS THE VERY DEPARTMENT WHICH WAS GIVING LEVIN SO MUCH TROUBLE JUST NOW
AND WHEN THE MILLER TOLD HIM OF IT HAD LODGED A COMPLAINT FOR SLANDER
WITH THE LADIES WERE SITTING AND STANDING SMART LAWYERS HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS IN SPECTACLES AND OFFICERS EVERYWHERE THEY WERE TALKING OF THE ELECTION AND OF HOW WORRIED THE MARSHAL WAS
THE CANDIDATE WHO WAS BEING VOTED ON WAS NEVYEDOVSKY WHO HAD SO STOUTLY DENIED ALL IDEA OF STANDING LEVIN WENT UP TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM IT WAS LOCKED
OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH LEVIN BUT LEVIN AS HE TALKED TO HIS BROTHER WAS CONTINUALLY LOOKING ROUND AT VRONSKY
PUT IT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WHISPERED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS WITH HIS BROTHER LEVIN FOLLOWED THE MARSHAL OF HIS DISTRICT TO THE TABLE BUT LEVIN HAD FORGOTTEN BY NOW THE CALCULATIONS THAT HAD BEEN EXPLAINED TO HIM
BUT HE WAS TOO BORED TO THINK WHAT IT WAS EXACTLY HE FELT DEPRESSED AND LONGED TO GET OUT OF THE CROWD
AND NOTICING HIS GLOOMY EYES FIXED UPON HIM HE SAID IN ORDER TO SAY SOMETHING HOW IS IT THAT YOU LIVING CONSTANTLY IN THE COUNTRY ARE NOT A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
TO THE HIGH TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM HIS LEGS STAGGERING IN HIS WHITE TROUSERS NEVYEDOVSKY HAD SCORED A HIGHER MAJORITY AS THEY HAD PLANNED AND HE WAS THE NEW MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE MANY PEOPLE WERE AMUSED
MANY WERE IN ECSTASIES MANY WERE DISGUSTED AND UNHAPPY THE FORMER MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE WAS IN A STATE OF DESPAIR WHICH HE COULD NOT CONCEAL WHEN NEVYEDOVSKY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM THE CROWD THRONGED ROUND HIM
A DEAD SILENCE FOLLOWED AND THEN A WEAK OLD VOICE WAS HEARD DECLINED
ON THE STAIRS HE MET A COUPLE A LADY RUNNING QUICKLY ON HER HIGH HEELS AND THE JAUNTY DEPUTY PROSECUTOR I TOLD YOU YOU WEREN'T LATE THE DEPUTY PROSECUTOR WAS SAYING AT THE MOMENT WHEN LEVIN MOVED ASIDE TO LET THE LADY PASS
OF CONTEMPORARY IDEAS AND TO FRAME THEIR POLICY SO AS FROM THE RIGHTS CONFERRED UPON THE NOBLES NOT AS THE NOBILITY BUT AS AN ELEMENT OF THE DISTRICT COUNCIL
TO DO ALL THE GOVERNOR HAD HOPED THEY WOULD DO CHURCH SERVICES ALWAYS AFFECTED LEVIN AND AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS I KISS THE CROSS AND GLANCED ROUND AT THE CROWD OF YOUNG AND OLD MEN REPEATING THE SAME HE FELT TOUCHED
THE DISCUSSION LASTED A LONG TIME AND ENDED IN NOTHING LEVIN WAS SURPRISED THAT THEY SHOULD DISPUTE UPON THIS SUBJECT SO LONG ESPECIALLY AS
IT'S A FIGHT HE SAID SCOWLING AND SETTING HIS POWERFUL JAWS
BUT UTTERLY WITHOUT ANY COMPREHENSION OF THE NEEDS OF MODERN DAYS HE ALWAYS TOOK IN EVERY QUESTION THE SIDE OF THE NOBILITY HE WAS POSITIVELY ANTAGONISTIC TO THE SPREAD OF POPULAR EDUCATION AND HE SUCCEEDED
LEVIN HAD BEEN SIX DAYS IN KASHIN VISITING THE ASSEMBLY EACH DAY AND BUSILY ENGAGED ABOUT HIS SISTER'S BUSINESS WHICH STILL DRAGGED ON THE DISTRICT MARSHALS OF NOBILITY WERE ALL OCCUPIED WITH THE ELECTIONS
THEN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TRIED TO WITHDRAW THEIR ADMISSION AND SERGEY IVANOVITCH BEGAN TO PROVE THAT THEY MUST LOGICALLY ADMIT EITHER
NOT TO FALL FOUL OF THEM BUT TO COMPREHEND AS FULLY AS HE COULD THE QUESTION WHICH WAS SO EARNESTLY AND ARDENTLY ABSORBING HONEST
I CERTAINLY SHALL NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ANSWERED THE MALIGNANT GENTLEMAN THIS WAS NEVYEDOVSKY HIMSELF
AND WAS AFRAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH MIGHT BE MISTAKEN IN SAYING THE RIGHT SIDE SURELY SNETKOV WAS THE ENEMY AS HE WENT UP HE HELD THE BALL IN HIS RIGHT HAND BUT THINKING HE WAS WRONG
SCOWLED WITH ANNOYANCE IT WAS NO GOOD FOR HIM TO USE HIS INSIGHT EVERYTHING WAS STILL AND THE COUNTING OF THE BALLS WAS HEARD THEN A SINGLE VOICE ROSE AND PROCLAIMED THE NUMBERS FOR AND AGAINST
AND FOLLOWED HIM ENTHUSIASTICALLY JUST AS THEY HAD FOLLOWED THE GOVERNOR WHO HAD OPENED THE MEETINGS AND JUST AS THEY HAD FOLLOWED SNETKOV
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE CAN BE SO ABSOLUTELY DEVOID OF POLITICAL TACT THAT'S WHERE WE RUSSIANS ARE SO DEFICIENT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE IS OUR OPPONENT
WHO SHOUTED IN A LOUD HIGH VOICE
IT'S BECAUSE I CONSIDER THAT THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IS A SILLY INSTITUTION LEVIN ANSWERED GLOOMILY HE HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH VRONSKY SO AS TO SMOOTH OVER HIS RUDENESS AT THEIR FIRST MEETING
MIHAIL STEPANOVITCH SNETKOV WOULD NOW BE BALLOTED FOR AS MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THE DISTRICT MARSHALS WALKED CARRYING PLATES ON WHICH WERE BALLS FROM THEIR TABLES TO THE HIGH TABLE AND THE ELECTION BEGAN
THE SECRETARY KNOCKED THE DOOR OPENED AND LEVIN WAS MET BY TWO RED FACED GENTLEMEN WHO DARTED OUT
AFTER LONG NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE LEGAL DETAILS THE MONEY WAS AT LAST READY TO BE PAID BUT THE NOTARY A MOST OBLIGING PERSON COULD NOT HAND OVER THE ORDER BECAUSE IT MUST HAVE THE SIGNATURE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT
YET THAT QUIET COUNTRYMAN MAY REACT IN HIS NARROW SYSTEM NOT LESS WHEN THE MODEST CHANGES IN HIS SURROUNDINGS PROVOKE HIM THE GOSSIP OF HIS NEIGHBOR MAY UNDERMINE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JUST AS MUCH AS A POLITICAL FIGHT OR THE STRUGGLES OF THE EXCHANGE THAT OF THE CITY MAN
EVERY CAUSE OF FRICTION WHICH CAN BE PERMANENTLY ANNIHILATED FOR THE PATIENT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE REMOVED THIS NEGATIVE REMEDY DEMANDS ITS POSITIVE SUPPLEMENT
BUT ALL THE SUBTLE VARIATIONS OF PREJUDICES AND BELIEFS PREFERENCES AND DISLIKES FAMILY LIFE AND SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS AMBITIONS AND PROSPECTS MEMORIES AND FANCIES
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WORK OF THE PHYSICIAN DOES NOT BEGIN WITH HIS CURATIVE EFFORTS THERAPY IS ALWAYS ONLY THE LAST STEP DIAGNOSIS AND OBSERVATION HAVE TO PRECEDE AND AN INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF THE DISEASE IS ESSENTIAL
THE FINEST ADJUSTMENT HAS TO COME IN DURING THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT OFTEN HAS TO SUGGEST ENTIRELY NEW LINES OF PROCEDURE
NOTHING SO AMUSED HIM AS BEING MAGNIFICENT HE HAD GIVEN TO COSETTE
EVERY MORNING A FRESH OFFERING OF BRIC A BRAC FROM THE GRANDFATHER TO COSETTE ALL POSSIBLE KNICKKNACKS GLITTERED AROUND HER ONE DAY MARIUS WHO WAS FOND OF TALKING GRAVELY IN THE MIDST OF HIS BLISS SAID
THE WILD CHASE FOR LUXURY IN THE HIGHER CLASSES REENFORCED BY THE COMMERCIALISM OF OUR TIME THE HARD AND MONOTONOUS LABOR IN OUR MODERN MILLS AND MINES FOR THE LOWER CLASSES
AND APPARENTLY WITH AS MUCH JOY AS COSETTE HERSELF AS HE HAD BEEN A MAYOR HE UNDERSTOOD HOW TO SOLVE THAT DELICATE PROBLEM
THE MOST EFFECTIVE AGENCY FOR THIS TASK IS CONTACT WITH BEAUTY BEAUTY IN NATURE AND LIFE BEAUTY IN ART AND LITERATURE AND MUSIC
ONLY MODERATELY CONCEALED OH THE LARGE LAUGHING MOUTHS AND HOW GAY WE WERE IN THOSE DAYS YOUTH WAS A BOUQUET
GIVE ME PERMISSION TO SPEAK I SAY NO EVIL OF THE PEOPLE AS YOU SEE I AM ALWAYS HARPING ON YOUR PEOPLE
HOWEVER OFTEN HE MAY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT SUCH A LIBERATION WOULD STOP THE SOURCE OF THE MENTAL TROUBLE
FRESHLY DECORATED VIOLET EBONY AND CALICO MAKE WAY MAKE WAY THE SIEUR CURMUDGEON IS MARRYING MADEMOISELLE CLUTCH PENNY SUMPTUOUSNESS AND SPLENDOR
THE MEN OF THE REVOLUTION ARE SO GREAT THAT THEY HAVE THE PRESTIGE OF THE AGES LIKE CATO
EARLIER TIMES SURELY MAY HAVE TREATED EVEN THE STRONGER VARIETIES OF THIS KIND AS TROUBLESOME VARIATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF THE NORMAL
AH IT IS TRUE I REGRET THE GRACE OF THE ANCIENT MANNERS I REGRET EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM THEIR ELEGANCE THEIR CHIVALRY
THERE IS NO NATION ON EARTH WHICH IS MORE PROUD OF ITS RUSH AND ITS HURRY THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND YET WHAT AN
MOREOVER OUR LIFE HAS PROBABLY BECOME COOLER THERE IS LESS EMOTIONALISM LESS SENTIMENTALITY MORE BUSINESS LIKE ATTITUDE AND THAT ALL MEANS LESS INNER FRICTION AND EXCITEMENT IN PUBLIC LIFE TOO LESS FEAR OF WAR AND LESS RELIGIOUS STRUGGLE
WHAT THE DEUCE MARRY WHEN YOU MARRY WITH FEVER AND GIDDINESS AND TUMULT AND THE UPROAR OF HAPPINESS BE GRAVE IN CHURCH WELL AND GOOD BUT AS SOON AS THE MASS IS FINISHED
WILL SUPPORT THE PHYSICIAN AND ACCORDINGLY HIS EXAMINATION IS NOT OBLIGED TO TRAP THE PATIENT BUT SIMPLY TO GUIDE HIM TO IMPORTANT POINTS BUT THEN BEGINS THE MOST ESSENTIAL STUDY OF DIAGNOSTICAL DIFFERENTIATION
OF COURSE WE STAND TODAY BEFORE A MUCH MORE COMPLEX SURROUNDING THAN OUR ANCESTORS BUT STILL MORE QUICKLY THAN THE COMPLEXITY HAVE GROWN THE MEANS TO MASTER IT
EVERYTHING IS TO BE AVOIDED WHICH INTERFERES WITH THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
TO ENJOY A LANDSCAPE OUGHT TO BE NOT MERELY A NEGATIVE REST FOR THE MAN OF THE OFFICE BUILDING AND GOOD LITERATURE OR MUSIC ABSORBS THE MENTAL ENERGIES AND HARMONIZES THEM
IT IS SIMPLY MEANT THAT HE GIVE UP HIS FATIGUING DAILY WORK EVEN IF THAT WORK IS MADE UP OF A ROUND OF ENTERTAINMENTS AND CALLS AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS THE NEURASTHENIC AND ALL SIMILAR VARIETIES ARE SENT AWAY FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY AWAY FROM THE RUSH OF THEIR BUSY LIFE
EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BALLET DANCERS HAS HAD ITS TROUSERS A MOUNTEBANK DANCER MUST BE GRAVE YOUR RIGADOONS ARE DOCTRINARIAN
I REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN IN THE CATHEDRAL OF STRASBURG A CLOCK
PARURES IN ANTIQUE GOLDSMITH'S WORK IVORY BON BON BOXES ORNAMENTED WITH MICROSCOPIC BATTLES GEWGAWS AND RIBBONS HE LAVISHED EVERYTHING ON COSETTE COSETTE AMAZED
YOU MUST MAKE A DREAM WHIRL AROUND THE BRIDE A MARRIAGE SHOULD BE ROYAL AND CHIMERICAL IT SHOULD PROMENADE ITS CEREMONY FROM THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS TO THE PAGODA OF CHANTELOUP
AND HE WOULD CALL HIM NESTOR MY FRIENDS IN BYGONE DAYS IN THOSE AMIABLE DAYS OF YORE PEOPLE MARRIED WISELY THEY HAD A GOOD CONTRACT AND THEN THEY HAD A GOOD CAROUSE
THANKS MARIUS THAT IS PRECISELY THE IDEA OF WHICH I WAS IN SEARCH AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A MAGNIFICENT DRESS OF TEA ROSE COLORED MOIRE ANTIQUE WAS ADDED TO COSETTE'S WEDDING PRESENTS
EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE ESTIMATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE STANDARD OF THE PARTICULAR CASE THIS RELATIVITY OF THE MENTAL REACTION ON THE DEMANDS OF LIFE MUST ALWAYS BE IN THE FOREGROUND OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC REGIME
SHE IS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST CHARMING GIRL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE LATER ON SHE'LL HAVE VIRTUES WITH AN ODOR OF VIOLETS HOW GRACEFUL ONE CANNOT LIVE OTHERWISE THAN NOBLY WITH SUCH A CREATURE
MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER FIELD OF MEDICINE THE PHYSICIAN HIMSELF HAS TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE FAR BEYOND THE OFFICE HOURS AND THE STRICTLY MEDICAL RELATIONS AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE IN WHICH THE TREATMENT MIGHT NOT PROFIT BY THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE
WE MAY BE GUIDED BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE INTEREST OF TESTING THE FATIGUE INDUCED BY MENTAL WORK
WHILE THE ADVICE OF THE PHYSICIAN OUGHT THUS TO EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS WHICH WORK NOT TOWARDS REST BUT TOWARD A HARMONIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY WE MUST NOT FORGET SOME ESSENTIAL NEGATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS
I PREDICT THAT ALL WAS LOST
DO NOT PRUNE THEM OF THEIR SPLENDORS DON'T SCRIMP ON THE DAY WHEN YOU BEAM THE WEDDING IS NOT THE HOUSEKEEPING OH IF I WERE TO CARRY OUT MY FANCY IT WOULD BE GALLANT VIOLINS WOULD BE HEARD UNDER THE TREES
THE FINEST IN THE HOUSE THAT WILL MAKE ME YOUNG AGAIN HE SAID IT'S AN OLD PLAN OF MINE I HAVE ALWAYS ENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF HAVING A WEDDING IN MY CHAMBER
BUT PROBABLY EACH OF THEM DOES BETTER TO GO ON THAN SIMPLY TO SWEAR OFF ALTOGETHER THEIR REST OUGHT TO HAVE THE CHARACTER OF VACATION THAT MEANS INTERRUPTIONS WITHOUT THE USUAL ACTIVITY OUGHT TO BE SHORT PERIODS SPENT WITH THE DISTINCT FEELING
EVERY ELEMENT OF A MAN'S LIFE HISTORY IMPRESSIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD HIS LOVE AND HIS SUCCESSES HIS DISEASES AND HIS DISTRESSES HIS ACQUAINTANCES AND HIS READING HIS TALENT HIS CHARACTER HIS SINCERITY HIS ENERGY HIS INTELLIGENCE
THE WHOLE EQUIPMENT OF THE MODERN LABORATORY OUGHT TO BE PUT AT ITS DISPOSAL PERCEPTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS REACTIONS AND EXPRESSIONS OUGHT TO BE EXAMINED WITH THE SAME CAREFULNESS WITH WHICH THE CONSCIENTIOUS PHYSICIAN EXAMINES THE BLOOD AND THE URINE
MOST OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF METHOD MUST BE LEFT TO THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN IN WHICH WIDE EXPERIENCE SOLID KNOWLEDGE TACT AND SYMPATHY OUGHT TO BE BLENDED EVEN THE WAY IN WHICH THE PATIENT REACTS ON THE METHOD WILL OFTEN GUIDE THE INSTINCT OF THE WELL TRAINED PSYCHOTHERAPIST
WAS TO BE TURNED OVER TO COSETTE AT HER MAJORITY OR AT THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE THIS TAKEN AS A WHOLE WAS VERY ACCEPTABLE AS THE READER WILL PERCEIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SUM DUE WAS HALF A MILLION THERE WERE SOME PECULIARITIES HERE AND THERE IT IS TRUE
OF WHICH OF THE TWO FAUCHELEVENTS COSETTE WAS THE DAUGHTER THEY SAID WHAT WAS WANTED AND THEY SAID IT WITH ZEAL AN ACTE DE NOTORIETE WAS DRAWN UP COSETTE BECAME IN THE EYES OF THE LAW MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FAUCHELEVENT
PEOPLE THOUGHT MUCH OF LOOKING WELL THEY EMBROIDERED AND TINTED THEMSELVES A BOURGEOIS HAD THE AIR OF A FLOWER A MARQUIS HAD THE AIR OF A PRECIOUS STONE PEOPLE HAD NO STRAPS TO THEIR BOOTS THEY HAD NO BOOTS
THAT IS A STORY WHICH WE HEAR A THOUSAND TIMES NOWADAYS YET IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THERE IS REALLY MUCH TRUTH IN SUCH A CLAIM AND WHETHER MUCH WISE PSYCHOTHERAPY CAN BE DEDUCED FROM IT
BUT TEN THOUSAND FRANCS HAD BEEN EXPENDED ON THE EDUCATION OF MADEMOISELLE EUPHRASIE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS OF THAT AMOUNT HAVING BEEN PAID TO THE CONVENT THIS LEGACY DEPOSITED IN THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY
WITH WINGS OF MECHLIN LACE THE INTOXICATION OF THE LOVERS WAS ONLY EQUALLED AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID BY THE ECSTASY OF THE GRANDFATHER
THE OVER EXCITEMENT BROUGHT TO EVERYBODY BY THE SENSATIONALISM OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AND OF OUR PUBLIC LIFE ALL INJURE THE BRAIN CELLS AND DAMAGE THE EQUILIBRIUM
PICPUS INQUIRY WAS MADE AT THAT CONVENT THE VERY BEST INFORMATION AND THE MOST RESPECTABLE REFERENCES ABOUNDED THE GOOD NUNS NOT VERY APT AND BUT LITTLE INCLINED TO FATHOM QUESTIONS OF PATERNITY
THAT JOYOUS LUXURY WHICH EVERY ONE POSSESSED MUSIC FORMING PART OF THE WEDDING A SYMPHONY ABOVE STAIRS A BEATING OF DRUMS BELOW STAIRS THE DANCES THE JOYOUS FACES ROUND THE TABLE
AS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FRANCS THEY CONSTITUTED A LEGACY BEQUEATHED TO COSETTE BY A DEAD PERSON WHO DESIRED TO REMAIN UNKNOWN THE ORIGINAL LEGACY HAD CONSISTED OF FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS
AS FAR AS REST INVOLVES SLEEP IT IS CERTAINLY THE IDEAL PRESCRIPTION THERE IS NO OTHER INFLUENCE WHICH BUILDS UP THE INJURED CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AS SAFELY AS SOUND NATURAL SLEEP
IF PERHAPS FOUR HOURS OF CONCENTRATED WORK ARE DONE WITHOUT PAUSES EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT THE QUALITY OF THE WORK DETERIORATES MEASURED FOR INSTANCE BY THE NUMBER OF MISTAKES IN QUICK CALCULATION
NOT OURS IS THE TASK OF ANALYZING SPECIAL METHODS OF NEUROLOGICAL AND MENTAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS SUCH AS ARE USED IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC AND IN THE OFFICE OF THE NERVE SPECIALIST THERE THE FAMILY HISTORY WITH REFERENCE TO NERVOUS AND OTHER DISEASES
THE TRANSITION HAD NOT BEEN SOFTENED AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STUNNED HAD THEY NOT BEEN DAZZLED BY IT DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID MARIUS TO COSETTE NO REPLIED COSETTE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE GOOD GOD IS CARING FOR US
EVEN TODAY MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT A NEURASTHENIC OR A PSYCHASTHENIC OR A HYSTERIC DISTURBANCE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY BE IN ITS BEGINNING
EVERYTHING OUGHT TO DETERMINE THE CHOICE OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC STEPS AS IT IS ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE ALL THOSE FACTORS BY ANY SUFFICIENT INQUIRY
SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM POOR SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR MY NEPHEW HE IS WEDDING A BEGGAR LET HIM BE A BEGGAR HIMSELF BUT COSETTE'S HALF MILLION PLEASED THE AUNT AND ALTERED HER INWARD SITUATION SO FAR
CORRESPONDS TO A COLD IN THE HEAD YOU SMELL NOTHING OF LIFE NEITHER ANY BAD NOR ANY GOOD ODOR MOREOVER THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS HAD SETTLED THE ELDERLY SPINSTER'S INDECISION
AND HE WILL NOT FORGET THAT THERE EXIST ALMOST NO SYMPTOMS OF SERIOUS DISEASES WHICH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE HYSTERIC MAY NOT IMITATE FOR A TIME
THAT THEY ARE INTERRUPTIONS OF THAT WHICH MUST LAST AND THAT THEY ARE NOT THEMSELVES TO BECOME LASTING STATES
IT IS SURPRISING HOW OFTEN UNSUSPECTED VISTAS OF THOUGHTS AND IMPULSES AND EMOTIONS ARE OPENED BY AN INQUIRING ANALYSIS WHERE THE DIRECT REPORT OF THE PATIENT DOES NOT AWAKEN THE LEAST SUSPICION
THEY SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETE REST OR COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME BUT A CONTINUATION OF THE LIFE FOR WHICH ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN LEARNED WITH A REASONABLE REDUCTION OF THE DEMANDS AND STIMULATIONS
THE INTELLECTUAL WORKER OUGHT TO DECREASE HIS WORK THE OVERBUSY SOCIETY WOMAN OUGHT TO STAY IN BED ONE DAY IN THE WEEK THE MAN IN THE MIDST OF THE RUSH OF LIFE OUGHT TO CUT DOWN HIS OBLIGATIONS
YOUR CENTURY IS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE WOULD DRIVE AWAY THE GRACES AS BEING TOO LOW IN THE NECK ALAS BEAUTY IS CONCEALED AS THOUGH IT WERE UGLINESS SINCE THE REVOLUTION
WHICH HAD THE KINDNESS TO INDICATE THE HOUR BUT WHICH HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING MADE FOR THAT AND WHICH
OFTEN WITHIN A SURPRISINGLY SHORT TIME THE BRAIN GATHERS THE ENERGIES TO OVERCOME THE FRICTIONS WITH UNAVOIDABLE SURROUNDINGS YET HERE THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO ADJUST THE PRESCRIBED DOSE OF OUTING VERY CAREFULLY TO THE SPECIAL CASE
OR A TUFT OF ROSES WHETHER HE WAS A SHEPHERD OR A WARRIOR AND IF BY CHANCE ONE WAS A CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS
COMPLETE REST FOR INSTANCE FOR A HARD BRAIN WORKER HARDLY OUGHT TO BE RECOMMENDED UNLESS A HIGH DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION HAS COME ON IF ROUTINE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE TO BE ADMITTED AT ALL
A MYSTERIOUS CHILDHOOD IS ALWAYS PREPARED FOR CERTAIN RENUNCIATIONS
AND LOSS OF SLEEP IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS CONDITIONS FOR THE BRAIN AGAIN REST IS A GREAT FACTOR IN THOSE SYSTEMATIC REST CURES WHICH FOR A LONG WHILE WERE ALMOST THE FASHION WITH THE NEUROLOGIST
BE ONE OF THE GODS AH PEOPLE MIGHT BE SYLPHS GAMES AND LAUGHTER ARGIRASPIDES THEY ARE STUPIDS
THE PHYSICIAN MAY FEEL JUSTIFIED IN THE INTEREST OF HIS PATIENT IN DRAWING THE THOUGHTS OUT OF THEIR HIDING PLACE BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS SKILL TACT AND EXPERIENCE ARE NEEDED THERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
THE GRANDFATHER WAS NOT THE LEAST HAPPY OF THEM ALL HE REMAINED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AT A TIME GAZING AT COSETTE THE WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE EXCLAIMED AND SHE HAS SO SWEET AND GOOD AN AIR
DAUPHINES WITHOUT A RIGHT OR WRONG SIDE IN THE PIECE
HER WEDDING BASKET SEEMED TO HER TO BE UPHELD BY SERAPHIM
SUBTLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE PERSONAL NEEDS AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONDITIONS IS NECESSARY IN EVERY CASE WHERE THE PSYCHICAL FACTOR IS TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE
NAMELY TO REMOVE THE EXTERNAL SOURCES OF THE DISTURBANCE EXTERNAL INDICATES THERE NOT ONLY THE OUTER WORLD BUT ALSO THE OWN BODY OUTSIDE THE CONSCIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN
HER HEART AND THE LOUVRE HER HEART AND THE GRAND WATERWORKS OF VERSAILLES GIVE ME MY SHEPHERDESS AND TRY TO MAKE HER A DUCHESS FETCH ME PHYLLIS CROWNED WITH CORN FLOWERS AND ADD A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS INCOME
THE EMPYREAN WITH THE SWANS AND THE EAGLES EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE TO FALL BACK ON THE MORROW INTO THE BOURGEOISIE OF THE FROGS
STRENUOSITY MUST NOT MEAN AN EXTERNAL RUSH WITH THE GESTURES OF OVERBUSY EXCITEMENT BUT CERTAINLY THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAZY LIFE IS WRETCHED PSYCHOTHERAPY AS LONG AS NO SERIOUS ILLNESS IS IN QUESTION
EQUAL TO THAT FOR MY PART I AM OF THE OPINION OF THE BIG CLOCK OF STRASBURG AND I PREFER IT TO THE CUCKOO CLOCK FROM THE BLACK FOREST
GROWTHS IN THE NOSE MAY BE OPERATED UPON THE ASTIGMATIC OR THE SHORT SIGHTED EYE MAY BE CORRECTED BY GLASSES THE CHILD WHO IS HARD OF HEARING MAY AT LEAST BE SEATED NEAR THE TEACHER AND THE BACKWARD CHILDREN QUICKLY REACH THE AVERAGE LEVEL
IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE ONE GREAT OBSTACLE IN THE WORK OF THE ROUTINE PHYSICIAN IS THE LACK OF TIME AND PATIENCE WHICH IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS IS ALWAYS QUICKER THAN TO INFLUENCE THE MIND
EVERYTHING WAS MADE READY FOR THE WEDDING THE DOCTOR ON BEING CONSULTED DECLARED THAT IT MIGHT TAKE PLACE IN FEBRUARY IT WAS THEN DECEMBER A FEW RAVISHING WEEKS OF PERFECT HAPPINESS PASSED
JEAN VALJEAN DID EVERYTHING SMOOTHED AWAY EVERY DIFFICULTY ARRANGED EVERYTHING MADE EVERYTHING EASY
THERE ARE NO TWO CASES ALIKE AND NOT ONLY THE EASILY RECOGNIZABLE DIFFERENCES OF SEX AND AGE AND OCCUPATION AND EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL MEANS AND TEMPERAMENT AND CAPACITY ARE DECISIVE
IT IS TRUE THAT HE OVERWHELMED HER WITH GALLANT COMPLIMENTS AND PRESENTS WHILE JEAN VALJEAN WAS BUILDING UP FOR COSETTE A NORMAL SITUATION IN SOCIETY AND AN UNASSAILABLE STATUS
THEY WERE SPRUCE SHINING WAVED LUSTROUS FLUTTERING DAINTY COQUETTISH WHICH DID NOT AT ALL PREVENT THEIR WEARING SWORDS BY THEIR SIDES THE HUMMING BIRD HAS BEAK AND CLAWS
A SURE MEANS OF NOT ENCOUNTERING ANY OBJECTIONS COSETTE WAS THE ONLY SCION OF AN EXTINCT FAMILY COSETTE WAS NOT HIS OWN DAUGHTER BUT THE DAUGHTER OF THE OTHER FAUCHELEVENT TWO BROTHERS FAUCHELEVENT HAD BEEN GARDENERS TO THE CONVENT
ON WHAT DOES THE WAR OF TROY TURN ON HELEN'S GARTER PARBLEU WHY DID THEY FIGHT WHY DID DIOMED
IF I HAVE A TEN POUND WEIGHT IN ONE HAND I MAY FIND THAT I MUST HAVE ONE POUND MORE IN THE OTHER HAND TO DISCRIMINATE THE DIFFERENCE
BUT ONE RULE IS COMMON TO ALL OF THEM NEVER USE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS IN A SCHEMATIC WAY LIKE A RIGID PATTERN SCHEMATIC TREATMENT IS A POOR TREATMENT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE BUT IN PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS IT IS DISASTROUS
THE FIRST METHOD TO BRING BACK THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL EQUILIBRIUM
TO BE SURE THE BRAIN DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE MERE REMOVAL OF THE ORIGINAL AFFLICTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REINSTATE THE NORMAL BALANCE OF MENTAL ENERGIES BUT WHEREVER SUCH A BODILY IRRITATION GOES ON IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO ABOLISH IT IN THE INTERESTS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY
IN THE SECOND PLACE COME GAMES AND SPORT WHICH MAY ENTER INTO THEIR RIGHT IF FATIGUE CAN BE AVOIDED HARMONIOUS JOYFUL COMPANY AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE DEPRESSING COMPANY OF THE SANITARIUMS WILL ADD ITS PLEASANTNESS
SHE WAS DECLARED AN ORPHAN BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER BEING DEAD
AND YET NO PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN START SUCCESSFULLY SO LONG AS THE PATIENT IS BROODING ON SECRET THOUGHTS AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS MIND THE DESIRE TO HIDE THEM MAY OFTEN BE ITSELF A PART OF THE DISEASE
RECEIVES NO IMPRESSIONS EITHER HUMAN OR PLEASANT OR PAINFUL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EARTHQUAKES AND CATASTROPHES THIS DEVOTION
THE INTELLECTUAL CLEARNESS OF THE PATIENT TOO EASILY TEMPTS ONE INTO TRUSTING THE SINCERITY OF HIS STORY AND YET THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS CLUSTERING PERHAPS ABOUT LOVE OR AMBITION ABOUT VICE OR CRIME ABOUT BUSINESS FAILURE OR FAMILY SECRETS
WITH ALL THE MEANS NOT ONLY OF PSYCHOLOGY BUT OF NEUROLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE HE HAS TO SEPARATE THE PARTICULAR CASE FROM SIMILAR ONES AND TO EXAMINE WHETHER HE DEALS WITH FOR INSTANCE A HYSTERIC OR WITH A PARANOIAC
THE PROGRESS OF SCIENTIFIC HYGIENE HAS BROUGHT EVERYONE MUCH NEARER TO A HARMONIOUS FUNCTIONING OF THE ORGANISM AND THE PROGRESS OF TECHNIQUE HAS REMOVED INNUMERABLE DIFFICULTIES FROM THE PLAY OF LIFE
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE ARRIVES AT WITH THAT MAJESTY AT BEING PETTY LEARN THIS JOY IS NOT ONLY JOYOUS IT IS GREAT BUT BE IN LOVE GAYLY THEN
I BELONG TO IT HE WHO LOVES WELL LASHES WELL THEREUPON I SAY PLAINLY THAT NOW A DAYS
ONE OWES SOME CONSIDERATION TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN LEAVE HER FORTUNE TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SINCE THEY DID NOT NEED IT
WITHHELD AND MAY FRUSTRATE EVERY PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE WHERE SUSPICION IS AWAKE AND MERE CONFIDENTIAL TALK AND PERSUASION SEEM INSUFFICIENT
ESPECIALLY IN THE DIGESTIVE AND SEXUAL SPHERES ARE SOURCES OF IRRITATION WHICH SLOWLY INFLUENCE THE WHOLE PERSONALITY
WE MAY BEGIN EVEN WITH THE VERY JUSTIFIABLE DOUBT WHETHER NERVOUSNESS REALLY HAS INCREASED IN OUR TIME EARLIER PERIODS HAD NOT SO MANY NAMES FOR THOSE SYMPTOMS AND WERE NOT ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE THEM WITH THE SAME CLEARNESS
SOMEWHAT RESENTFUL IN HER INMOST SOUL
ABOVE ALL THE INTENSITY OF MENTAL STIMULI IS ALWAYS RELATIVE THE PSYCHOLOGIST KNOWS THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH DETERMINE THAT WE PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE OF IMPRESSIONS AS ALIKE WHEN THE STIMULI ARE PROPORTIONAL
NO DOUBT IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT AS WELL OFTEN ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT AND FROM A STRICTLY PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW UNIMPORTANT ABNORMITIES IN THE BODILY SYSTEM
GAMACHO ENTERED BUT IN SOOTH THE STOMACH IS AN AGREEABLE BEAST WHICH DEMANDS ITS DUE AND WHICH WANTS TO HAVE ITS WEDDING ALSO
SIMPLY TO WITHDRAW A PATIENT FROM THE ONE KIND OF LIFE
THE PATIENT MUST BE BROUGHT UNDER CONDITIONS AND INFLUENCES WHICH GIVE FAIR CHANCES FOR THE RECUPERATION OF HIS ENERGIES TOO OFTEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PSYCHOLOGIST THE PRESCRIPTION IS SIMPLY REST
THAT HE WAS APPOINTED UNDER THE NAME OF FAUCHELEVENT AS COSETTE'S GUARDIAN
ONE OF THE SIDES OF THAT CENTURY WAS DELICATE THE OTHER WAS MAGNIFICENT AND BY THE GREEN CABBAGES PEOPLE AMUSED THEMSELVES TO DAY PEOPLE ARE SERIOUS THE BOURGEOIS IS AVARICIOUS THE BOURGEOISE IS A PRUDE
IT IGNORES THE NOBLE IN EVERYTHING IT IS CLEAN SHAVEN YOUR THIRD ESTATE IS INSIPID COLORLESS ODORLESS AND SHAPELESS THE DREAMS OF YOUR BOURGEOIS WHO SET UP AS THEY EXPRESS IT A PRETTY BOUDOIR
THE FINE SPUN GALLANT COMPLIMENTS THE SONGS THE FIREWORKS THE FRANK LAUGHTER THE DEVIL'S OWN ROW THE HUGE KNOTS OF RIBBON I REGRET THE BRIDE'S GARTER THE BRIDE'S GARTER IS COUSIN TO THE GIRDLE OF VENUS
THAT THE CLOUD DID NOT LAST LONG SHE HAD MARIUS THE YOUNG MAN ARRIVED THE OLD MAN WAS EFFACED SUCH IS LIFE AND THEN COSETTE HAD FOR LONG YEARS BEEN HABITUATED TO SEEING ENIGMAS AROUND HER
THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO FIND THE MIDDLE WAY BETWEEN A TEMPORARY REMOVAL OF IRRITATION WHICH REALLY ALLOWS A DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ENERGIES AND A MERE INTERRUPTION WHICH SIMPLY DAMAGES THE ACQUIRED RELATIVE ADJUSTMENT
IN A SIMILAR WAY THE PSYCHICAL EXAMINATION TESTS THE HALLUCINATIONS AND ILLUSIONS THE VARIATIONS AND DEFECTS OF MEMORY AND ATTENTION OF JUDGMENT AND REASONING OF ORIENTATION AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS OF EMOTIONS AND VOLITIONS
IF WE TAKE IT IN THE WIDEST MEANING THIS WOULD EVIDENTLY INCLUDE EVERY POSSIBLE MEDICAL TASK FROM FILLING A PAINFUL TOOTH TO OPERATING ON A PAINFUL APPENDIX AS IN EVERY CASE WHERE PAIN RESULTS THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM IS DISTURBED BY IT AND THE NORMAL MENTAL LIFE OF THE PATIENT REDUCED IN ITS EFFICIENCY
I GRANT TO THIS AGE THE DEVICE DIRTY CLEANLINESS
MARIUS MY BOY YOU ARE A BARON YOU ARE RICH DON'T GO TO PETTIFOGGING I BEG OF YOU
IT IS THEREFORE CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN SIMPLY DECIDE BEFOREHAND ON A DEFINITE COURSE OF PSYCHICAL TREATMENT AND LEAVE THE CARRYING OUT TO A WELL MEANING MINISTER OR ANY OTHER MEDICAL AMATEUR WHO SCHEMATICALLY FOLLOWS THE INDICATED PATH
HOMER WOULD CONSTRUCT THE ILIAD HE WOULD PUT IN HIS POEM
THAT GREAT BRAZEN HELMET OF TEN POINTS WHY DID ACHILLES AND HECTOR HEW EACH OTHER UP WITH VAST BLOWS OF THEIR LANCES BECAUSE HELEN ALLOWED PARIS TO TAKE HER GARTER WITH COSETTE'S GARTER
BY FAR THE BEST ALTERATION IS THEREFORE EVEN IN THE PERIODS OF INTERRUPTION NOT SIMPLY REST BUT NEW ENGAGEMENTS WHICH AWAKEN NEW INTERESTS AND STIMULATE NEGLECTED MENTAL FACTORS DISBURDENING THE OVER STRAINED ELEMENTS OF MENTAL LIFE
AND MY FIDDLE TO AMUSE ME AND I WOULD N'T CHANGE WITH THE KING OF SUGAR CANDY I WAS THERE SAID CRAGGS IT'S A FINE ISLAND MY LORD WANTS TO SEE THE DOCTOR SAID A WOMAN ENTERING HASTILY AND THE DOCTOR IS READY FOR HIM
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE HAVE YOU GIVEN HIM ANYTHING BROKE IN THE BOY HURRIEDLY I TOOK A BLEEDING FROM HIM LITTLE SHORT OF SIXTEEN OUNCES FROM THE TEMPORIAL SAID BILLY PROUDLY
WHY DIDN'T THE GIRL CONFIDE IN HER FATHER AT LEAST ABOUT THESE THINGS WHAT WAS AFOOT SHE HAD THROWN OVER LAKE ONCE AND IT SEEMED SHE WAS GOING TO TURN HIM DOWN AGAIN WELL
CHEAP PENKNIVES AND SCISSORS PENCIL CASES BODKINS AND THE LIKE AND I WANDERED ABOUT FOR WEEKS THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL THE LAKE COUNTRY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE
IT'S THE SAME AS OPENING A SLUICE IN A MILL DAM HE S BETTER ALREADY HE LOOKS EASIER SAID CRAGGS AY AND HE FEELS IT CONTINUED BILLY JUST NOTICE THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS AND SEE HOW EASY THE INTERCOSTIALS IS DOING THEIR WORK NOW
THE NIGHT BEFORE LARRY WAS STRETCHED AND IN A VOICE OF A DEEP AND MELLOW FULNESS MANAGED WITH CONSIDERABLE TASTE SANG A FIG FOR THE CHANSONS OF FRANCE WHOSE MEANING IS ALWAYS A RIDDLE
CARBINEER IF THE SAME TO YOU MASTER SAID THE OTHER QUIETLY I NEVER SERVED IN THE INFANTRY
HE WAS COMING NOW TO EUROPE FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF SEEING V V AND HAVING THINGS OUT WITH HER FULLY AND COMPLETELY BECAUSE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SHE MADE SUCH AN ENDLESS SERIES OF DELAYS IN COMING TO AMERICA
LAKE WOULD NEVER HAVE COUNTED FOR ANYTHING AT ALL SUPPOSE SHE DID TURN HIM DOWN IN ITSELF THAT WASN'T A THING TO BREAK HER FATHER'S HEART WHAT DID MATTER WAS NOT WHETHER SHE THREW LAKE OVER BUT WHAT SHE THREW HIM OVER FOR
AND TOP WITH SILVER EVERY MOUNTAIN'S HEAD THEN SHINE THE VALES THE ROCKS IN PROSPECT RISE A FLOOD OF GLORY BURSTS FROM ALL THE SKIES THE CONSCIOUS SWAINS REJOICING IN THE SIGHT
AND THE OTHER WAS MISTER GUNTER LAKE ON THE MEGANTIC ONE DAY OUT FROM SANDY HOOK WHO FOUND HIMSELF EQUALLY SLEEPLESS AND PREOCCUPIED AND ALTHOUGH MISTER LAKE WAS A MAN OF VAST ACTIVITIES AND COMPLICATED ENGAGEMENTS
SORRA TASTE OF IT MUTTERED ANOTHER THERE'S A SEA RUNNIN OUTSIDE NOW THAT WOULD SWAMP A LIFE BOAT I'LL NOT LOSE AN ILLIGANT SITUATION OF SIX POUNDS TEN A YEAR
MOTHER OF I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY AMERICAN GLOUCESTERS BATH WE'LL GET IN SOMEHOW AND THEN AS AN ANGLO AMERICAN SHOWMAN I SHALL BE TEMPTED TO RUN YOU NORTHWARD A LITTLE WAY PAST TEWKESBURY
FOR HE WAS DISCOORSIN ABOUT NIGHT AND THE MOON AND ALL THAT VARIOUS POETS SAID ABOUT THEM YE'D THINK THAT HE HAD BOOKS AND WAS READING OUT OF THEM SO GLIBLY CAME THE VERSES FROM HIS LIPS I NEVER LISTENED TO SUCH A VOICE BEFORE SO SOFT SO SWEET
THAT COULD N'T COMPOSE YOU TEN HEXAMETERS IF YE'D PUT THEM ON A HOT GRIDDLE FOR IT AND THERE'S OTHERS THAT WOULD TALK RHYME RATHER THAN RAYSON AND SO WITH THE ARS MEDICATRIX EVERYBODY HAS N'T AN EYE FOR A HECTIC OR AN EAR FOR A COUGH NON CONTIGIT
SHE HAD HAD NO HUSBAND OF THE LORD AND MASTER TYPE SO TO SPEAK BUT ONLY A PRINCE CONSORT WELL IN HAND WHY SHOULDN'T THE GRAMMONT HEIRESS DOMINATE HER MALE BELONGING IF IT CAME TO THAT IN THE SAME FASHION
ENTERTAINING A LOVER BEING POSSIBLY MOST SHAMEFUL THOUGHT IN LOVE LIKE SOME ORDINARY SILLY FEMALE SINKING TO KISSES TO THE DEEDS ONE COULD BUY AND PAY FOR HIS V V
TILL AT LAST HE GAVE OUT IN ALL THE FULNESS OF HIS LIQUID VOICE THEM ELEGANT LINES OUT OF POPE'S HOMER AS WHEN THE MOON REFULGENT LAMP OF NIGHT O'ER HEAVEN'S CLEAR AZURE SPREADS HER SACRED LIGHT
IN FACT IT POSSESSED THE GREATEST OF ALL CLAIMS TO THEIR ADMIRATION FOR IT WAS PARTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND BY THE ARTFUL INTRODUCTION OF A WORD HERE AND THERE OF WHICH HIS HEARERS KNEW NOTHING
IF IT WAS BECAUSE HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH WELL AND GOOD BUT IF IT WAS FOR SOME OTHER LOVER SOME GOOD LOOKING WORTHLESS IMPOSTOR SOME EUROPEAN TITLE OR SUCHLIKE FOLLY
LOOKING OUT DREAMILY OVER BEAUTIFUL VIEWS THEY WOULD LUNCH IN SHAFTESBURY AND WALK ROUND IT THEN THEY WOULD GO IN THE AFTERNOON THROUGH THE PLEASANT WEST COUNTRY WHERE THE CELTS HAD PREVAILED AGAINST THE OLD FOLK OF THE STONEHENGE TEMPLE
THE BETTER TO ADMIT AIR TO THE SICK MAN AS BILLY DREW NIGH WITH CAUTIOUS STEPS HE PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH WORN AND WASTED BY LONG ILLNESS THE PATIENT WAS A MAN STILL IN THE VERY PRIME OF LIFE
AND THE BALTIC NORTHMEN PAST THE EMPERORS AND THE CORINTHIAN COLUMNS THAT SMOTHERED LATIN EUROPE FOR YOU AND ME ANYHOW THIS IS OUR PAST THIS WAS OUR CHILDHOOD AND THIS IS OUR LAND
THE LIFE IS NOT SO BAD SAID CRAGGS BUT IT'S LONELY SOMETIMES LIFE NEED NEVER BE LONELY SO LONG AS A MAN HAS HEALTH AND HIS FACULTIES SAID BILLY GIVE ME NATURE TO ADMIRE A BIT OF BAYCON FOR DINNER
SAID BILLY I'LL HAVE TO BE UP AT THE OFFICE FOR THE BAGS AT SIX O'CLOCK FAIX
BUT IT WAS WELL HER BROKEN ENGAGEMENT WITH LAKE HAD BEEN RESUMED AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN BROKEN OFF IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY TALK THAT FACT ANSWERED IT AND NOW THAT LAKE HAD SERVED HIS PURPOSE
BUT NOBODY REFLECTS ON THE SINTRY THAT DIES AT HIS POST IF YOU MUST AND WILL GO I'LL GIVE YOU THE YAWL SAID CRAGGS AND I LL GO WITH YOU MYSELF SPOKE LIKE A BRITISH GRENADIER CRIED BILLY WITH ENTHUSIASM
AS AN ABLE YOUNG BUSINESS MAN PERHAPS SOME DAY A LONG TIME AHEAD SHE MIGHT MARRY THERE WASN'T MUCH REASON FOR IT BUT IT MIGHT BE SHE WOULD NOT WISH TO BE CALLED A SPINSTER TAKE A HUSBAND
ASKED THE CORPORAL OF A WOMAN WHO WITH BARE FEET AND DRESSED IN THE HUMBLEST FASHION OF THE PEASANTRY APPEARED HE'S GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER SIR I BELIEVE HE'S SINKING I'M GLAD IT'S BILLY IS COME I'D RATHER SEE HIM THAN ALL THE DOCTORS IN THE COUNTRY
SAID BILLY WITH A DEGREE OF CONFUSION THAT RAISED A HEARTY LAUGH AT HIS EXPENSE WELL BUT WHERE'S THE SONG EXCLAIMED ANOTHER AY SAID CRAGGS WE ARE FORGETTING THE SONG NOW FOR IT BILLY
SAID CRAGGS PUSHING BILLY TOWARDS THEM AS HE SPOKE FAIX AND YE MIGHT HAVE GOT WORSE MUTTERED A VERY OLD MAN BILLY TRAYNOR HAS THE LUCKY HAND HOW IS MY LORD NOW NELLY
AND WITH AN APPETITE THAT SHOWED HOW MUCH HE RELISHED IT THIS IS ELEGANT LIVING YE HAVE HERE MISTER CRAGGS SAID BILLY AS HE DRAINED HIS TANKARD OF BEER AND PLACED IT WITH A SIGH ON THE TABLE MANY HAPPY YEARS OF IT TO YE I
HE PERCEIVED THAT YOU WERE NOT A DOCTOR SAID CRAGGS WHEN THEY REACHED THE CORRIDOR
TURNING AS HE WENT TO LOOK BACK TOWARDS THE BED AND EVIDENTLY GOING WITH RELUCTANCE IS IT FEVER ASKED THE SICK MAN IN A FAINT BUT UNFALTERING ACCENT IT'S A KIND OF CEREBRAL CONGESTION A MATTER OF THEM MEMBRANES THAT'S OVER THE BRAIN
AND YOUR OWN HEART BUT WHAT YE ARE TO OTHERS THAT WITHOUT THAT SACRET BOND BETWEEN YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF YOU AT ALL I REMEMBER ONCE ON A TIME I WAS IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND TRAVELLING PARTLY FOR PLEASURE AND PARTLY WITH A VIEW TO A SMALL SPECULATION IN SHEFFIELD WARE
LESS CONFIDENT OF HIS OWN MERITS BUT UNDER NO POSSIBLE CHANGE OF PLACES OR PEOPLE COULD THE PRAISE HAVE BESTOWED MORE SINCERE PLEASURE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE JIM MORRIS SAID HE
AND BILLY OBEYED WITHOUT SPEAKING WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS CRAGGS SAID THE VISCOUNT TREMBLING WITH PASSION WHO HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME WHAT BEGGAR HAVE YOU PICKED OFF THE HIGHWAY OR IS HE THE TRAVELLING FOOL OF THE DISTRICT
WHEN I HAVEN'T TUPPENCE TO BUY TOBACCO AND WITHOUT A SHOE TO MY FOOT AND MY HAIR THROUGH MY HAT I CAN BE DANCIN WID PRINCESSES AND HANDIN EMPRESSES IN TO TAY MUSHA MUSHA
RUNNING OUT INTO THE LAKE AND THERE WAS TWO ISLANDS ALL WOODED TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND BEHIND ALL IN THE DISTANCE WAS A GREAT MOUNTAIN WITH CLOUDS ON THE TOP AND IT WAS JUST THE SEASON WHEN THE TREES IS BEGINNIN TO CHANGE THEIR COLORS
OLD GRAMMONT AS HE APPEARED UPON THE PILLOW OF HIS BED BY THE LIGHT OF A ROSE SHADED BEDSIDE LAMP WAS A SMALL HEADED GREY HAIRED GENTLEMAN WITH A WRINKLED FACE AND SUNKEN BROWN EYES YEARS OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE
HE MADE ME COME ALONG AT HIS SIDE DISCOORSIN ME ABOUT MY THRAVELS AND ALL I SEEN AND ALL I READ TILL WE REACHED AN ELEGANT LITTLE COTTAGE ON A BANK RIGHT OVER THE LAKE AND THEN HE BROUGHT ME IN AND MADE ME TAKE TAY WITH THE FAMILY AND I SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
DON'T BE HASTY YOUR HONOR SAID BILLY SUBMISSIVELY AND DON'T BE UNJUST THE REALMS OF DISAZE IS LIKE AN UNKNOWN TRACT OF COUNTRY OR A COUNTRY THAT'S ONLY KNOWN A LITTLE JUST ROUND THE COAST AS IT MIGHT BE ONCE YE'RE BEYOND THAT
BROKE IN CRAGGS I WAS BRIGADED WITH ARENTSCHILD'S HANOVERIANS IN SPAIN AND THEY USED TO SIT OUTSIDE THE TENTS EVERY EVENING AND SING BY JOVE HOW THEY DID SING ALL TOGETHER LIKE THE SWELL OF A CHURCH ORGAN YES YOU'RE RIGHT
SAID BILLY PRODUCING A VERY ANCIENT LANCET CASE OF BOXWOOD TIPPED WITH IVORY I'LL JUST TAKE A DASH OF BLOOD FROM THE TEMPORAL ARTERY TO RELIEVE THE CEREBRUM AND THEN WE'LL PUT COWLD ON HIS HEAD AND KEEP HIM QUIET
AND I STRETCHED MYSELF DOWN AT THE WATER'S EDGE AND I FELL INTO A FIT OF MUSING IT'S OFTEN AND OFTEN I TRIED TO REMEMBER THE ELEGANT FANCIES THAT CAME THROUGH MY HEAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT I THOUGHT I SAW THAT NIGHT OUT ON THE LAKE FORNINT ME
THE MUSIC TO SING OR TO DANCE IS AN IRISH TUNE PLAYED ON THE FIDDLE TO YOUR SONGS OF THE RHINE AND THE RHONE I M READY TO CRY OUT I AM SATIS JUST GIVE US SOMETHING OF OUR OWN IN PRAISE OF OUR LAND OF POTATOES
AND FOR MANY AN HOUR AFTERWARDS WHEN I JUST THINK OVER THEIR KIND WORDS AND PLEASANT FACES MORE THAN ONE OF THE COMPANY HAD DROPPED OFF ASLEEP DURING BILLY'S NARRATIVE AND OF THE OTHERS THEIR COMPLAISANCE AS LISTENERS APPEARED TAXED TO THE UTMOST
HIS PROTECTIVE DUTY TO THEM THESE COMPANIONS THESE SEYFFERT WOMEN AND SO FORTH WERE ALL VERY WELL IN THEIR WAY THERE WASN'T MUCH THEY KEPT FROM YOU IF YOU GOT THEM CORNERED AND ASKED THEM INTENTLY
JUST AS HE MAY HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE BY OBSERVATION WHAT IS SICKNESS AFTER ALL BUT JUST ONE OF THE PHENOMENONS OF ALL ORGANIC AND INORGANIC MATTER A REGULAR SORT OF SHINDY IN A MAN'S INSIDE LIKE A THUNDERSTORM OR A HURRY CANE OUTSIDE
SAID BILLY BUT EVIDENTLY YIELDING AN UNWILLING ASSENT TO THIS DOCTRINE THE GERMANS HAS A FINE NATIONAL MUSIC AND THEY RE GREAT FOR HARMONY BUT HARMONY AND MELODY IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND WHICH IS BEST BILLY ASKED ONE OF THE COMPANY
STRAIGHT AND LOVELY DESIRABLE AND UNAPPROACHABLE ABOVE THAT SORT OF NONSENSE ABOVE ALL OTHER MASCULINE SUBJUGATION V V I'M GOING TO MAKE A MAN OF YOU HIS MIND GREW CALMER
AND IT SHALL BE HAPPY FOR YOU ALL I ASK ALL I ASK PROTECT GUARD CHERISH FOR TO MISTER GUNTER LAKE IT SEEMED THERE COULD BE NO LOVELIER THING IN LIFE THAN A WIFE
THOUGHT OLD GRAMMONT WHEN I AM GONE AS ONE TAKES A BUTLER TO MAKE THE HOUSEHOLD COMPLETE IN PREVIOUS MEDITATIONS ON HIS DAUGHTER'S OUTLOOK OLD GRAMMONT HAD FOUND MUCH THAT WAS VERY SUGGESTIVE IN THE PRECEDENT OF QUEEN VICTORIA
WHILE THE CORPORAL SNORED LOUDLY LIKE A MAN WHO HAD A RIGHT TO INDULGE HIMSELF TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THERE'S THE BELL AGAIN MUTTERED ONE THAT'S FROM THE LORD'S ROOM AND CRAGGS STARTING UP BY THE INSTINCT OF HIS OFFICE HASTENED OFF
AND THE ROMANS AGAINST THE CELTS AND THE SAXONS AGAINST THE ROMANIZED BRITONS AND THE DANES AGAINST THE SAXONS A WAR SCARRED LANDSCAPE ABOUNDING IN DYKES AND ENTRENCHMENTS AND CASTLES SUNKEN NOW INTO THE DEEPEST PEACE TO GLASTONBURY
SAID SIR RICHMOND IT WILL BE LIKE TURNING OVER THE PAGES OF THE HISTORY OF OUR FAMILY TO AND FRO
MUTTERED HE AS HE FINISHED AND THEN GENTLY DISPLACING THE BEDCLOTHES LAID HIS HAND UPON THE HEART WITH A LONG DRAWN SIGH LIKE THAT OF UTTER WEARINESS THE SICK MAN MOVED HIS HEAD ROUND AND FIXED HIS EYES UPON HIM
ASKED THE CORPORAL EAGERLY HE LL DO HE LL DO SAID BILLY HE'S A SANGUINEOUS TEMPERAMENT AND HE'LL BEAR THE LANCET IT'S JUST LIKE WEATHERIN A POINT AT SAY IF YOU HAVE A CRAFT THAT WILL CARRY CANVAS THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE FOR YOU
I HAVE IT NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HE SAID MAKING A LOW OBEISANCE TO THE COMPANY AND SO SAYING HE STRUCK UP A VERY POPULAR TUNE THE SAME TO WHICH A REVEREND DIVINE WROTE HIS WORDS OF
I'LL HAVE THAT HAIR OFF OF HIM IF HE IS N'T COOLER TOWARDS EVENING SO SAYING HE COVERED THE SICK MAN WITH THE WETTED CLOTHS AND BATHED HIS HANDS IN THE COOLING FLUID
YE SEE I WAS FRESH AND FASTIN I NEVER TASTED A BIT THE WHOLE DAY AND MY BRAIN MAYBE WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR SOMEHOW JANIUS REAL JANIUS THRIVES BEST ON A LITTLE STARVATION AND FROM MUSING
MY DUTY ADDED HE SOMEWHAT PRETENTIOUSLY IS TO CARRY THE KING'S MAIL AND IF ANYTHING WAS TO OBSTRUCKT OR IMPADE OR DELAY THE CORRESPONDIENCE IT'S ON ME THE BLAME WOULD LIE
EYE THE BLUE VAULT AND BLESS THE USEFUL LIGHT THE LORD FORGIVE ME BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE LAST WORDS AND SAID USEFUL LIGHT I COULDN'T RESTRAIN MYSELF BUT BROKE OUT THAT'S MIGHTY LIKE A BULL ANYHOW
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT AGAINST HER HE HAD ASKED IN A LOW EVEN VOICE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SIR SAID THE AGENT SUDDENLY WHITE TO THE LIPS
SAID ONE COAXINGLY OR A SONG WOULD BE BETTER OBSERVED ANOTHER FAIX CRIED A THIRD TIS HIMSELF COULD DO IT AND IN FRINCH OR LATIN IF YE WANTED IT THE GERMANS WAS THE BEST I EVER KNEW FOR MUSIC
THENCE THEY WOULD GO ON TO WELLS TO SEE YET ANOTHER GREAT CATHEDRAL AND TO DINE AND SLEEP GLASTONBURY ABBEY AND WELLS CATHEDRAL BROUGHT THE STORY OF EUROPE RIGHT UP TO REFORMATION TIMES THAT WILL BE A GOOD DAY FOR US
FOLLOW ME SAID CRAGGS GIVING A SIGNAL TO STEP LIGHTLY AND HE LED THE WAY UP A NARROW STONE STAIR WITH A WALL ON EITHER HAND
OLD GRAMMONT DID NOT CARE IN THE LEAST IF HE WAS SHELVED V V COULD STAND ALONE OLD GRAMMONT HAD GOT A PHRASE IN HIS MIND THAT LOOKED LIKE DOMINATING THE SITUATION HE DREAMT OF SAYING TO V V
WHATEVER SHE WANTED IN PARIS SHOULD BE HERS HE'D JUST LET HER RIP THEY'D BE LIKE SWEETHEARTS TOGETHER HE AND HIS GIRL OLD GRAMMONT DOZED OFF INTO DREAMLAND SECTION FIVE
CRIED HE ANGRILY WHAT I AM IS N'T SO AISY TO SAY BUT WHO I AM IS CLEAN BEYOND ME ARE YOU A DOCTOR ASKED THE SICK MAN FIERCELY I'M AFEAR'D I'M NOT
THE ACCENTUATION OF THESE WORDS MARKED AS IT WAS BY THE STRONGEST PROVINCIALISM OF THE PEASANT ATTRACTED THE SICK MAN'S ATTENTION AND HE BENT UPON HIM A LOOK AT ONCE SEARCHING AND SEVERE WHAT ARE YOU WHO ARE YOU
AND BLENDED IN WITH THE SLIGHT SPLASH OF OARS THAT MOVED THROUGH THE WATER CAREFULLY AS THOUGH NOT TO LOSE A WORD OF HIM THAT WAS SPEAKIN IT'S CLEAN BEYOND ME TO TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID AND MAYBE IF I COULD
OLD GRAMMONT STARED AT HIS MEMORY OF THAT MOMENT FOR A WHILE THAT AFFAIR WAS ALL RIGHT QUITE ALL RIGHT OF COURSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND ALSO HAPPILY CASTON WAS AMONG THE DEAD
AND I'LL GIVE HIM NOW A CONCOCTION OF MEADOW SAFFRON WITH A PINCH OF SALTPETRE IN IT TO CAUSE DIAPHORESIS D'YE MIND MEANWHILE
SINCE ALL IS GOING ON SO WELL ABOVE STAIRS I'LL DRAW YOU A GALLON OF ALE BOYS AND WE LL DRINK TO THE MASTER'S SPEEDY RECOVERY IT WAS A RARE OCCASION WHEN THE CORPORAL SUFFERED HIMSELF TO EXPAND IN THIS FASHION AND GREAT WAS THE APPLAUSE AT THE UNEXPECTED MUNIFICENCE
AND TELL THEM TO SEND THEIR INSTRUCTIONS TO WELLS
REGRETTING HIS DIMINISHING ABILITY TO SLEEP IN THE EARLY MORNING NOW EVEN WHEN HE WAS IN THE STRONG AND SOOTHING AIR OF MID ATLANTIC AND THINKING OF V V BECAUSE SHE HAD A WAY OF COMING INTO HIS MIND WHEN IT WAS UNDEFENDED
TWO GENTLEMEN WERE COMING TOWARDS HER ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WHOSE MINDS IT CHANCED WERE VERY BUSILY OCCUPIED BY HER AFFAIRS ONE OF THESE WAS HER FATHER WHO WAS LYING IN HIS BRASS BED IN HIS COMMODIOUS CABIN ON THE HOLLANDIA
HUSH BE STILL MUTTERED CRAGGS HERE'S THE YOUNG MASTER AND AS HE SPOKE A YOUTH OF ABOUT FIFTEEN WELL GROWN AND HANDSOME BUT POORLY EVEN MEANLY CLAD APPROACHED THEM HAVE YOU SEEN MY FATHER
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING OF OUR OLD RIVER SEVERN WE WILL COME RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT IF WE GO THROUGH BRISTOL THERE WE SHALL HAVE A WHIFF OF AMERICA OUR NEW FIND FROM WHICH THE TOBACCO COMES
BUT FOR ALL THAT IT WOULD BE GOING TOO FAR TO SAY THAT I WAS N'T A DOCTOR T IS THE SAME WITH PHYSIC AND POETRY YOU TAKE TO IT OR YOU DON'T TAKE TO IT THERE'S CHAPS AY AND FAR FROM STUPID ONES EITHER
IT WAS THIS FELLOW OR NOTHING AND BETTER A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER NOTHING SAID THE BOY THAN TRUST HIS LIFE TO THE COARSE IGNORANCE OF THIS WRETCHED QUACK AND IN HIS PASSION THE WORDS WERE UTTERED LOUD ENOUGH FOR BILLY TO OVERHEAR THEM
HE TURNED TO THE CORPORAL AND SAID LOOK TO HIM CRAGGS AND LET HIM HAVE HIS SUPPER AND WHEN HE HAS EATEN IT SEND HIM TO MY ROOM BILLY BOWED AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND FOLLOWED THE CORPORAL TO THE KITCHEN THAT'S MY LORD'S SON I SUPPOSE
NEVER FEAR YET IT WAS A CURIOUS ANOMALY THAT WHILE ONE HAD A THOUSAND WAYS OF DEFENDING ONE'S DAUGHTER AND ONE'S PROPERTY AGAINST THAT DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND THERE WAS NO POWER ON EARTH BY WHICH A FATHER
RELIEVE THE GORGED VESSELS AND DON'T DROWN THE GRAND HYDRAULIC MACHINE THE HEART THEM'S MY SENTIMENTS TURNING FROM THE SPEAKER WITH A LOOK OF ANGRY IMPATIENCE THE BOY WHISPERED SOME WORDS IN THE CORPORAL'S EAR WHAT COULD I DO SIR WAS THE ANSWER
ONE MAN IS AS GOOD A GUIDE AS ANOTHER
BUT THE ANGER THAT SUPPLIED STRENGTH HITHERTO NOW FAILED TO IMPART ENERGY AND HE SANK BACK WASTED AND EXHAUSTED THE CORPORAL BENT OVER HIM AND SPOKE SOMETHING IN A LOW WHISPER BUT WHETHER THE WORDS WERE HEARD OR NOT THE SICK MAN NOW LAY STILL
HE IS THE SORT OF MAN WHO CAN ARRANGE THINGS LIKE THAT THERE'LL BE SOMEONE AT FALMOUTH TO LOOK AFTER US AND PUT US ABOARD THE LINER I MUST WIRE THEM WHERE I CAN PICK UP A TELEGRAM TO MORROW WELLS IN SOMERSET
WITH BRAINS REDUCED A DOABLE DEBT TO PAY TO DREAM BY NIGHT SELL SHEFFIELD WARE BY DAY WELL WITH THAT HE TOOK A FIT OF LAUGHING AND HANDING THE REST OUT OF THE BOAT
JUST TO GO INTO A CHURCH HERE AND THERE AND SHOW YOU MONUMENTS BEARING LITTLE SHIELDS WITH THE STARS AND STRIPES UPON THEM
WHEN NOT A BREATH DISTURBS THE DEEP SERENE AND NOT A CLOUD O'ERCASTS THE SOLEMN SCENE AROUND HER THRONE THE VIVID PLANETS ROLL AND STARS UNNUMBERED GILD THE GLOWING POLE O'ER THE DARK TREES A YELLOWER VERDURE SHED
DON'T I KNOW MY DEAR GIRL THAT YOU DON'T LOVE ME YET LET THAT BE AS YOU WISH I WANT NOTHING YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE ME NOTHING AT ALL ALL I ASK IS THE PRIVILEGE OF MAKING LIFE HAPPY
SO MUSICAL AND THE WORDS CAME DROPPIN DOWN LIKE THE CLEAR WATER FILTERIN OVER A ROCKY LEDGE AND GLITTERIN LIKE LITTLE SPANGLES OVER MOSS AND WILD FLOWERS IT WASN'T ONLY IN ENGLISH BUT SCOTCH BALLADS TOO AND ONCE OR TWICE IN ITALIAN THAT HE RECITED
BREATHING HEAVILY CAN YOU DO NOTHING FOR HIM ASKED CRAGGS PEEVISHLY NOTHING BUT ANGER HIM TO BE SURE I CAN IF YOU LET ME
THE LETTERS WOULDN'T GO THE FASTER BECAUSE YOU WERE DROWNED BROKE IN THE CORPORAL NO SIR SAID BILLY RATHER STAGGERED BY THE GRIN OF APPROVAL THAT MET THIS REMARK NO SIR WHAT YOU OB SARVE IS TRUE
THERE'S BULLS IN THE ANCIENTS I LL POINT OUT A BULL IN ARISTOPHANES WHAT HAVE WE HERE SAID HE TURNING TO THE OTHERS A POOR CRAYTURE SAYS I LIKE GOLDSMITH'S CHEST OF DRAWERS
IS IT YOU SAID HE WITH A QUIET LAUGH THAT ACCUSES POPE OF A BULL IT IS SAYS I AND WHAT'S MORE THERE ISN'T A POET FROM HORACE DOWNWARDS THAT I WON'T SHOW BULLS IN THERE'S BULLS IN SHAKSPEARE AND IN MILTON
THE WASHINGTON FAMILY MONUMENTS IT WAS NOT ONLY FROM ENGLAND THAT AMERICA CAME SAID MISS GRAMMONT BUT ENGLAND TAKES AN AMERICAN MEMORY BACK MOST EASILY AND MOST FULLY
TRAVERSING A LONG LOW CORRIDOR THEY REACHED A DOOR AT WHICH HAVING WAITED FOR A SECOND OR TWO TO LISTEN CRAGGS TURNED THE HANDLE AND ENTERED THE ROOM WAS VERY LARGE AND LOFTY AND SEEN IN THE DIM LIGHT OF A SMALL LAMP UPON THE HEARTHSTONE
WHATEVER ELSE YOU CALLED HER AND NO ONE COULD CALL GRAMMONT BLOOD ALL ORDINARY FLUID OLD GRAMMONT HAD NEVER HAD ANY DELUSIONS ABOUT LAKE IF LAKE'S FATHER HADN'T BEEN A BIG MAN
SAID HE AS HE SEATED HIMSELF AND A FINE YOUNG CRAYTURE TOO PUER INGENUUS WITH A GRAND FRONTAL DEVELOPMENT AND WITH THIS REFLECTION HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE COARSE BUT ABUNDANT FARE WHICH CRAGGS PLACED BEFORE HIM
MITIGATED ONLY BY SUCH EXERCISE AS THE GAME OF POKER AFFORDS HAD INTENSIFIED AN INSTINCTIVE INEXPRESSIVENESS UNDER THE MOST SOLITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OLD GRAMMONT WAS STILL INEXPRESSIVE
WHICH IS AS MUCH AS TO SAY TO STORM THE SKIES OR LAY SIEGE TO THE MOON GIVE ME ONE OF THE LINE OR A HEAVY DRAGOON IT'S THE SAME TO ME AS THE POET SAYS AND A LOW MURMUR OF THE COMPANY SEEMED TO ACCORD APPROVAL TO THE SENTIMENT
THERE'S EIGHT OR NINE OF US HERE WOULD MISS HIM IF HE WAS GONE TROTH HE DOESN'T GIVE MUCH EMPLOYMENT BUT WE COULDN'T SPARE HIM CROAKED OUT A THIRD WHEN THE ENTRANCE OF THE CORPORAL CUT SHORT FURTHER COMMENTARY AND THE PARTY GATHERED AROUND THE CHEERFUL TURF FIRE
HE WAS NOT EVEN TRYING TO SLEEP WHY HE MEDITATED HAD V V STAYED ON IN EUROPE SO MUCH LONGER THAN SHE NEED HAVE DONE AND WHY HAD GUNTER LAKE SUDDENLY GOT INTO A STATE OF MIND ABOUT HER
THE POET WAS WELL AWARE THAT HE WAS SECURING THEIR HEARTIEST APPROVAL NOR WAS BILLY INSENSIBLE TO SUCH FLATTERIES THE IRRITABILE GENUS HAS ITS SOFT SIDE AND CAN ENJOY TO THE UTTERMOST ITS OWN SUCCESSES
IT IS BUT FAIR TO SAY THERE WAS NEITHER COMMENT NOR IMPATIENCE ON THE CONTRARY THEY SEEMED TO ACCEPT THESE CONVULSIVE THROES OF SOUND AS AN EARNEST OF THE GRAND FLOOD OF MELODY THAT WAS COMING
BILLY AT THE SAME MOMENT TOOK OUT HIS FIDDLE AND BEGAN THAT PROCESS OF PREPARATORY SCREWING AND SCRAPING WHICH NO MATTER HOW DISTRESSING TO THE SURROUNDERS SEEMS TO AFFORD INTENSE DELIGHT TO PERFORMERS ON THIS INSTRUMENT IN THE PRESENT CASE
LIKE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN IRELAND MORE WOOD FOREST TIMBER AND BETTER OFF PEOPLE BUT NOTHING BEYOND THAT WELL ONE EVENING IT WAS IN AUGUST I CAME DOWN BY A NARROW PATH TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE WHERE THERE WAS A STONE SEAT
HE SHOULD HAVE STARTED THREE HOURS EARLIER CHAPMAN RANCH WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN MILES AWAY BUT THERE WAS A ROAD FOR ONLY THREE MILES OF THE DISTANCE HE HAD RIDDEN OVER THERE ONCE WITH ONE OF THE HALF MOON COWPUNCHERS AND HE HAD THE DIRECTION WELL DEFINED IN HIS MIND
WAS HERE RECEIVING A PUBLIC LESSON AT WHICH MARGUERITE COULD NOT HELP BUT REJOICE BUT THE COMTESSE FOR WHOM RESPECT OF ROYALTY AMOUNTED ALMOST TO A RELIGION WAS TOO WELL SCHOOLED IN COURTLY ETIQUETTE TO SHOW THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF EMBARRASSMENT
YOU LOOK JEST LIKE ONE OF THEM HAYSEEDS IN THE PICTURE PAPERS STEAD OF A FREE AND INDEPENDENT SHEEPMAN OF THE STATE O TEXAS SAM CLIMBED AWKWARDLY INTO THE SADDLE
THERE WAS A BIG LUMP IN HIS THROAT AS HE THOUGHT OF THE CROSS WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HIS WIFE SURELY IT WAS HARD ENOUGH FOR HER TO LIVE IN THAT HORRIBLE COUNTRY WITHOUT HAVING TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF HIS ABUSE HE CURSED HIMSELF GRIMLY AND FELT A SUDDEN FLUSH OF SHAME THAT
IT DOES YOU CREDIT I WAS JUST THINKING THE SAME THING THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSED IT WOULD NOT BE HONORABLE OR PRAISEWORTHY SAYS I FOR US TO LET MURKISON GO ON WITH THIS PROJECT HE HAS TAKEN UP
AND THE FLAT CHAPEAU BRAS UNDER HIS ARM
THE HISTORIC BALL GIVEN BY THE THEN SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS LORD GRENVILLE WAS THE MOST BRILLIANT FUNCTION OF THE YEAR THOUGH THE AUTUMN SEASON HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP SOME WHEN IT COMES TO CASHING IN THE TICKET TO THAT FIVE TO ONE SHOT YES I'D REALLY TAKE IT AS A PASTIME AND REGALEMENT IF YOU BOYS WOULD GO ALONG TOO
UNTIL NOW HE HAD BEEN HOPING TO STRIKE THE TRAIL THAT LED TO THE FRIO CROSSING AND THE CHAPMAN RANCH HE MUST HAVE CROSSED IT AT SOME DIM PART OF IT AND RIDDEN BEYOND IF SO HE WAS NOW SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY MILES FROM HOME
RUMOUR HAS IT IN FRANCE THAT YOUR HIGHNESS COULD AN YOU WOULD GIVE THE TRUEST ACCOUNT OF THAT ENIGMATICAL WAYSIDE FLOWER HE LOOKED QUICKLY AND KEENLY AT MARGUERITE AS HE SPOKE BUT SHE BETRAYED NO EMOTION AND HER EYES MET HIS QUITE FEARLESSLY
A LONG JOVIAL INANE LAUGH BROKE THE SUDDEN SILENCE WHICH HAD FALLEN OVER EVERYONE AND WE POOR HUSBANDS CAME IN SLOW AFFECTED ACCENTS FROM GORGEOUS SIR PERCY WE HAVE TO STAND BY WHILE THEY WORSHIP A DEMMED SHADOW
I KNOW YOU ARE ALL RIGHT OR I WOULDN'T CONFIDE IN YOU I WROTE TO THEM RASCALS AGAIN JUST FOR FUN THEY ANSWERED AND TOLD ME TO COME ON TO CHICAGO THEY SAID TELEGRAPH TO J SMITH WHEN I WOULD START
ME AND ANDY SEES AT A GLANCE WHAT IT IS BUT WE PRETEND TO READ IT THROUGH IT WAS ONE OF THEM OLD TIME TYPEWRITTEN GREEN GOODS LETTERS EXPLAINING HOW FOR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU COULD GET FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BILLS
YOU ARE TEN TIMES WORSE SAYS I THAN THAT GREEN GOODS MAN YOU GO TO CHURCH AT HOME AND PRETEND TO BE A DECENT CITIZEN BUT YOU'LL COME TO CHICAGO AND COMMIT LARCENY FROM MEN THAT HAVE BUILT UP A SOUND AND PROFITABLE BUSINESS
JEFF PETERS WAS ALWAYS ELOQUENT WHEN THE ETHICS OF HIS PROFESSION WAS UNDER DISCUSSION THE ONLY TIMES SAID HE
NOT TEN YARDS AWAY MARTHY SERENE AND COMFORTABLE SAT IN HER ROCKING CHAIR BEFORE THE DOOR IN THE SHADE OF THE HOUSE WITH HER FEET RESTING LUXURIOUSLY UPON THE STEPS
WHY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I SAY SAYS I I SAY LET'S SETTLE THIS THING RIGHT HERE NOW I DON'T SEE ANY USE OF WASTING ANY MORE TIME
OH SHET UP AND RIDE ALONG SAID MISSUS WEBBER WITH A LITTLE JERK AT THE HANDLES OF HER CHAIR YOU ALWAYS FUSSIN BOUT MY READIN I DO A PLENTY AND I'LL READ WHEN I WANTER I LIVE IN THE BRESH HERE LIKE A VARMINT
SHOW OUR GRATITUDE TO ENGLAND BY DEVOTION TO THE WISHES OF MONSEIGNEUR MADAME SAID MARGUERITE WITH ANOTHER CEREMONIOUS CURTSEY MADAME RESPONDED THE COMTESSE WITH EQUAL DIGNITY
BRING EM ALONG HE'LL SAY OF COURSE IF THEY CARE TO INVEST NOW HOW DOES THAT SCHEME STRIKE YOU
WHEN I GET THERE I'M TO WAIT ON A CERTAIN STREET CORNER TILL A MAN IN A GRAY SUIT COMES ALONG AND DROPS A NEWSPAPER IN FRONT OF ME THEN I AM TO ASK HIM HOW THE WATER IS AND HE KNOWS IT'S ME AND I KNOW IT'S HIM
AND HE HAD A BURNING LOVE FOR HIS OWN COUNTRY THESE THREE SENTIMENTS MADE HIM SUPREMELY INDIFFERENT TO THE SNUBS HE RECEIVED IN THIS FOG RIDDEN LOYALIST OLD FASHIONED ENGLAND
IT WAS A MERE NOTHING FOR A CATTLEMAN OR A SHEEPMAN TO BE LOST FOR A DAY OR A NIGHT THE THING OFTEN HAPPENED IT WAS MERELY A MATTER OF MISSING A MEAL OR TWO AND SLEEPING COMFORTABLY ON YOUR SADDLE BLANKETS ON A SOFT MATTRESS OF MESQUITE GRASS
AND THE FRIO THE RANCH HOUSE A TWO ROOM BOX STRUCTURE WAS ON THE RISE OF A GENTLY SWELLING HILL IN THE MIDST OF A WILDERNESS OF HIGH CHAPARRAL
IN FRONT OF IT WAS A SMALL CLEARING WHERE STOOD THE SHEEP PENS SHEARING SHED AND WOOL HOUSE ONLY A FEW FEET BACK OF IT BEGAN THE THORNY JUNGLE
IS MOSTLY UNBECOMING TO YOUR CHARMING SEX MADAME MADAME LA COMTESSE DE TOURNAY DE BASSERIVE SAID LORD GRENVILLE INTRODUCING THE LADY THIS IS A PLEASURE MADAME MY ROYAL FATHER AS YOU KNOW IS EVER GLAD TO WELCOME THOSE OF YOUR COMPATRIOTS
ADDED MARGUERITE LOOKING ALMOST WITH DEFIANCE ACROSS AT THE PLACID SPHINX LIKE FACE OF THE FRENCHMAN
WE WORSHIP HIM WE WEAR HIS BADGE WE TREMBLE FOR HIM WHEN HE IS IN DANGER AND EXULT WITH HIM IN THE HOUR OF HIS VICTORY CHAUVELIN DID NO MORE THAN BOW PLACIDLY BOTH TO THE PRINCE AND TO MARGUERITE
THEY SHOW YOU BRAND NEW REAL MONEY AND SELL YOU ALL YOU WANT AT FIVE FOR ONE
THE DISTINGUISHED HOST STOOD READY TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS DISTINGUISHED MEN BEAUTIFUL WOMEN NOTABILITIES FROM EVERY EUROPEAN COUNTRY HAD ALREADY FILED PAST HIM
MURKISON WAS TO MEET THE GRAY MAN AT HALF PAST NINE WE HAD DINNER AT A HOTEL AND THEN WENT UP TO MURKISON'S ROOM TO WAIT FOR THE TIME TO COME NOW BOYS SAYS MURKISON
AND HAVE THEM SEND DOWN A BIG BOX OF NOVELS AND READING MATTER FOR MARTHY THINGS WERE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT HE WONDERED WHETHER A LITTLE PIANO COULD BE PLACED IN ONE OF THE ROOMS OF THE RANCH HOUSE WITHOUT THE FAMILY HAVING TO MOVE OUT OF DOORS
BY ALL MEANS THEY ARE AMONG THE LUCKY ONES THEN LORD GRENVILLE TURNED IN SEARCH OF THE COMTESSE WHO SAT AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM LUD LOVE ME WHISPERED HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS TO MARGUERITE AS SOON AS HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RIGID FIGURE OF THE OLD LADY
HE FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE FRENCH ARISTOCRAT WAS THE MOST BITTER ENEMY OF FRANCE HE WOULD HAVE WISHED TO SEE EVERY ONE OF THEM ANNIHILATED HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO DURING THIS AWFUL REIGN OF TERROR
FREQUENTLY WIND UP AT THEIR STARTING POINT IT WAS WHEN SAM WEBBER WAS FULLEST OF CONTRITION AND GOOD RESOLVES THAT MEXICO WITH A HEAVY SIGH SUBSIDED FROM HIS REGULAR BRISK TROT
HE FELT THAT BOTH SPEECHES WERE INTENDED EACH IN THEIR WAY TO CONVEY CONTEMPT OR DEFIANCE THE PLEASURE LOVING IDLE PRINCE HE DESPISED
THAT ME AND ANDY TUCKER EVER HAD ANY HIATUSES IN OUR CORDIAL INTENTS WAS WHEN WE DIFFERED ON THE MORAL ASPECTS OF GRAFTING ANDY HAD HIS STANDARDS AND I HAD MINE
TO LOOK OVER SOME IRON ORE PROPERTY IN WEST VIRGINIA HE WIRES J SMITH THAT HE WILL SET FOOT IN THE SPIDER WEB ON A GIVEN DATE AND THE THREE OF US LIGHTS OUT FOR CHICAGO ON THE WAY MURKISON
WHOM FRANCE HAS DRIVEN FROM HER SHORES YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IS EVER GRACIOUS REPLIED THE COMTESSE WITH BECOMING DIGNITY THEN INDICATING HER DAUGHTER WHO STOOD TIMIDLY BY HER SIDE MY DAUGHTER SUZANNE MONSEIGNEUR SHE SAID
IN SPITE OF THEIR BICKERINGS WHEN NIGHT CAME MARTHY WAS WONT TO DISMISS HER FEARS OF THE COUNTRY AND REST HER HEAD UPON SAM'S STRONG ARM WITH A SIGH OF PEACEFUL CONTENT AND DEPENDENCE AND WERE HER FEARS SO GROUNDLESS
WITH WONDERFUL CHARM AND DIGNITY WE BUT NAME THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL AND EVERY FAIR CHEEK IS SUFFUSED WITH A BLUSH OF ENTHUSIASM NONE HAVE SEEN HIM SAVE HIS FAITHFUL LIEUTENANTS WE KNOW NOT IF HE BE TALL OR SHORT
AS THEIR FOOTPRINTS HAVE ATTESTED
IF YOU ANSWER IT THEY WRITE AGAIN ASKING YOU TO COME ON WITH YOUR MONEY AND DO BUSINESS BUT THINK OF EM WRITING TO ME SAYS MURKISON A FEW DAYS LATER HE DROPS AROUND AGAIN BOYS SAYS HE
NEVER SEEIN NOR HEARIN NOTHIN AND WHAT OTHER MUSEMENT KIN I HAVE NOT IN LISTENIN TO YOU TALK FOR IT'S COMPLAIN COMPLAIN ONE DAY AFTER ANOTHER OH GO ON SAM AND LEAVE ME IN PEACE
THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE I WOULD CRAVE PERMISSION TO PRESENT TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS HERE INTERPOSED LORD GRENVILLE AH WHO IS IT ASKED THE PRINCE
WHICH UNACCUSTOMED SOUND CAUSED MEXICO TO SHY A BIT A LIVIN WITH A SORE HEADED KIOTE LIKE ME A LOW DOWN SKUNK THAT OUGHT TO BE LICKED TO DEATH WITH A SADDLE CINCH A COOKIN AND A WASHIN AND A LIVIN ON MUTTON AND BEANS
SEE HE ADDED TURNING TO THE GROUPS ROUND THE ROOM THE LADIES HANG UPON YOUR LIPS YOU WOULD RENDER YOURSELF POPULAR AMONG THE FAIR SEX IF YOU WERE TO GRATIFY THEIR CURIOSITY AH MONSEIGNEUR SAID CHAUVELIN SIGNIFICANTLY
IF HE IS DETERMINED TO GO LET US GO WITH HIM AND PREVENT THIS SWINDLE FROM COMING OFF ANDY AGREED WITH ME AND I WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT HE WAS IN EARNEST ABOUT BREAKING UP THIS GREEN GOODS SCHEME
HE TURNED NOW TO HIS RIGHT UP A LITTLE HILL PEBBLE COVERED UPON WHICH GREW ONLY THE TENACIOUS AND THORNY PRICKLY PEAR AND CHAPARRAL
LORD GRENVILLE SAID TO HIS ROYAL GUEST
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MEAN THAT ANDY SAYS I BUT WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS TOO LONG FOR ME TO TAKE OFFENSE AT A TAUNT THAT YOU WILL REGRET WHEN YOU COOL OFF I HAVE YET SAYS I TO SHAKE HANDS WITH A SUBPOENA SERVER
THERE WERE NO HILLS NOW THAT THEY COULD CLIMB TO OBTAIN A VIEW OF THE COUNTRY THEY CAME UPON A FEW BUT SO DENSE AND INTERLACED WAS THE BRUSH THAT SCARCELY COULD A RABBIT PENETRATE THE MASS THEY WERE IN THE GREAT LONELY THICKET OF THE FRIO BOTTOMS
I DON'T CALL MYSELF A RELIGIOUS MAN SAYS I OR A FANATIC IN MORAL BIGOTRY BUT I CAN'T STAND STILL AND SEE A MAN WHO HAS BUILT UP HIS BUSINESS BY HIS OWN EFFORTS AND BRAINS AND RISK
AND TO FRANCE THE PRINCE LOOKED AT HIM KEENLY FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
PERHAPS YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR NATIONAL HERO THAN WE DO OURSELVES
I DIDN'T APPROVE OF ALL OF ANDY'S SCHEMES FOR LEVYING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC AND HE THOUGHT I ALLOWED MY CONSCIENCE TO INTERFERE TOO OFTEN FOR THE FINANCIAL GOOD OF THE FIRM WE HAD HIGH ARGUMENTS SOMETIMES
IN ABOUT TWO HOURS HE DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS LOST THEN CAME THE USUAL CONFUSION OF MIND AND THE HURRY TO GET SOMEWHERE
I'D HATE TO SEE ANY MONEY DROPPED IN IT AS BAD AS YOU WOULD WELL WE WENT TO SEE MURKISON NO BOYS SAYS HE I CAN'T CONSENT TO LET THE SONG OF THIS CHICAGO SIREN WAFT BY ME ON THE SUMMER BREEZE
I'LL FRY SOME FAT OUT OF THIS IGNIS FATUUS OR BURN A HOLE IN THE SKILLET
FAIR OR DARK HANDSOME OR ILL FORMED BUT WE KNOW THAT HE IS THE BRAVEST GENTLEMAN IN ALL THE WORLD
ALL FAMILIAR BY CONSTANT REPETITION AND YET ALL STRANGE AND NEW IF HE COULD ONLY ARRIVE SOMEWHERE THE STRAIGHT LINE IS ART NATURE MOVES IN CIRCLES A STRAIGHTFORWARD MAN
DID THEIR VERY BEST TO STIR UP FOREIGN INDIGNATION AGAINST FRANCE PLOTS WITHOUT END WERE HATCHED IN ENGLAND IN BELGIUM IN HOLLAND
AH THEN SAID THE PRINCE THIS TIME VERY GRACIOUSLY
LEANING AGAINST ONE OF THE CONSOLE TABLES CHAUVELIN IN HIS IRREPROACHABLE BLACK COSTUME WAS TAKING A QUIET SURVEY OF THE BRILLIANT THRONG HE NOTED THAT SIR PERCY AND LADY BLAKENEY HAD NOT YET ARRIVED
WHY CERTAINLY SAYS I WHAT ELSE COULD IT HAVE BEEN WASN'T IT YOURS TOO IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR ANDY SPOKE AGAIN I THINK THERE ARE TIMES WHEN ANDY DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND MY SYSTEM OF ETHICS AND MORAL HYGIENE
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES AND SUITE SIR PERCY BLAKENEY LADY BLAKENEY LORD GRENVILLE WENT QUICKLY TO THE DOOR TO RECEIVE HIS EXALTED GUEST
THAT'S THE KIND OF TRADER BILL MURKISON IS YES I JIST BELIEVE I'LL DROP UP CHICAGO WAY AND TAKE A FIVE TO ONE SHOT ON J SMITH I GUESS THE WATER'LL BE FINE ENOUGH
YOU COME UP HERE ALL SANCTIFIED AND VANOPLIED WITH RESPECTABILITY AND A PLEASING POST OFFICE ADDRESS TO SWINDLE HIM
LET'S GET OUR GUMPTION TOGETHER AND INOCULATE A PLAN FOR DEFEATING THE ENEMY SUPPOSE WHILE I'M EXCHANGING AIRY BANDAGE WITH THE GRAY CAPPER YOU GENTS COME ALONG BY ACCIDENT YOU KNOW AND HOLLER HELLO MURK
AND HE'LL HAVE TO KEEP HIS CONTRACT IF HE DOES BUSINESS WITH BILL MURKISON
THE ACCREDITED AGENT OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT CHAUVELIN IMMEDIATELY THE PRINCE ENTERED HAD STEPPED FORWARD EXPECTING THIS INTRODUCTION HE BOWED VERY LOW WHILST THE PRINCE RETURNED HIS SALUTE WITH A CURT NOD OF THE HEAD MONSIEUR
I THINK IT'S THE DUTY OF EVERY CITIZEN SAYS HE TO TRY TO DO UP THESE ROBBERS THAT PREY UPON THE PUBLIC I'LL SHOW EM WHETHER THE WATER'S FINE FIVE DOLLARS FOR ONE THAT'S WHAT J SMITH OFFERS
HE WAS COMING ON PRESENTLY FROM THE OPERA
THE GRASSDALE PEOPLE LIKED US AND ME AND ANDY DECLARED A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES NEVER SO MUCH AS FLOATING THE FLY LEAF OF A RUBBER CONCESSION PROSPECTUS OR FLASHING A BRAZILIAN DIAMOND WHILE WE WAS THERE
SAM WAS GOING TO RIDE OVER TO THE CHAPMAN RANCH TO SEE ABOUT BUYING SOME MORE IMPROVED MERINO RAMS AT LENGTH HE CAME OUT READY FOR HIS RIDE THIS BEING A BUSINESS TRIP OF SOME IMPORTANCE
SAYS ANDY BOYS SAYS MURKISON I'VE GOT IT IN MY MIND THAT THEM FELLOWS CAN'T FOOL ME I THINK I'LL PUT A COUPLE OF THOUSAND IN MY JEANS AND GO UP THERE AND PUT IT ALL OVER EM
THEN HE SAYS JEFF DO YOU MIND MY ASKING YOU A QUESTION TWO SAYS I OR FORTY WAS THAT THE IDEA YOU HAD SAYS HE WHEN WE STARTED OUT WITH MURKISON
IT'S YOU SUPPOSEDLY RESPECTABLE CITIZENS WHO ARE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT TO GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING SAYS I THAT SUPPORT THE LOTTERIES AND WILD CAT MINES AND STOCK EXCHANGES AND WIRE TAPPERS OF THIS COUNTRY
BUT THE MORE INTIMATE CIRCLES OF LONDON SOCIETY IGNORED HIM ALTOGETHER THE WOMEN OPENLY TURNED THEIR BACKS UPON HIM THE MEN WHO HELD NO OFFICIAL POSITION REFUSED TO SHAKE HIS HAND
BY DEALING WITH SUCH CONTEMPTIBLE SCOUNDRELS AS YOU HAVE TRIED TO BE TO DAY HOW DO YOU KNOW SAYS I THAT THAT GREEN GOODS MAN HASN'T A LARGE FAMILY DEPENDENT UPON HIS EXTORTIONS
HE GAVE MEXICO A SMART KICK WITH HIS HEELS
MARTHY LEISURELY ROCKING IN HER CHAIR FIXED HER PLACE IN THE BOOK WITH HER FINGER AND TURNED HER HEAD SMILING MISCHIEVOUSLY AS SHE NOTED THE HAVOC SAM HAD WROUGHT WITH HIS APPEARANCE IN TRYING TO FIX UP
YOUR AMIABLE RECEPTION OF ME AT OUR LAST MEETING STILL DWELLS PLEASANTLY IN MY MEMORY
FROM BETTING ON BRYAN'S ELECTION
INTO SOMETHING MUCH LESS PLEASING TO THE SIGHT THE TIGHT WHITE COLLAR AWKWARDLY CONSTRICTED HIS MUSCULAR MAHOGANY COLORED NECK THE BUTTONLESS SHIRT BULGED IN STIFF WAVES BENEATH HIS UNBUTTONED VEST
HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO UTTER THE HISTORIC AND FEROCIOUS DESIRE THAT ARISTOCRATS MIGHT HAVE BUT ONE HEAD BETWEEN THEM SO THAT IT MIGHT BE CUT OFF WITH A SINGLE STROKE OF THE GUILLOTINE
ME AND ANDY TRIES TO GET THIS FINANCIAL MISQUOTATION OUT OF MURKISON'S HEAD
WHEN WE REMEMBER THAT HE IS AN ENGLISHMAN
THE PRINCE IN THE MEANWHILE WAS SAYING A FEW GRACIOUS WORDS TO THE YOUNG VICOMTE I AM HAPPY TO KNOW YOU MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE HE SAID I KNEW YOUR FATHER WELL WHEN HE WAS AMBASSADOR IN LONDON AH MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED THE VICOMTE
MEXICO WAS ANXIOUS TO REDEEM THE SITUATION TWISTING WITH ALACRITY ALONG THE TORTUOUS LABYRINTHS OF THE JUNGLE AT THE MOMENT HIS MASTER'S SURENESS OF THE ROUTE HAD FAILED HIS HORSE HAD DIVINED THE FACT
HE QUICKENED HIS GAIT INTO A LANGUID TROT ROUNDING A GREAT CLUMP OF BLACK CHAPARRAL HE STOPPED SHORT SAM DROPPED THE BRIDLE REINS AND SAT
IS WHAT KEEPS THE JAILS AND COURT HOUSES GOING YOU COME UP HERE TO ROB THESE MEN OF THEIR MONEY DOES IT EXCUSE YOU I ASKS THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO SKIN YOU NO SIR YOU WAS GOING TO ROB PETER TO STAND OFF PAUL
GET OUT THAT TWO THOUSAND AND LAY IT ON THE TABLE OBEY WITH VELOCITY SAYS I FOR OTHERWISE ALTERNATIVES ARE IMPENDING I AM PREFERABLY A MAN OF MILDNESS BUT NOW AND THEN I FIND MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF EXTREMITIES
IN A LITTLE BOOK HE THOUGHT OF MARTHY AS SHE HAD BEEN WHEN HE FIRST MET HER IN DOGTOWN SMART PRETTY AND SAUCY BEFORE THE SUN HAD TURNED THE ROSES IN HER CHEEKS BROWN AND THE SILENCE OF THE CHAPARRAL HAD TAMED HER AMBITIONS
JEFF SAYS HE SOME TIME WHEN YOU HAVE THE LEISURE I WISH YOU'D DRAW OFF A DIAGRAM AND FOOT NOTES OF THAT CONSCIENCE OF YOURS
NOW GET OUT YOUR WATCH SAYS I TO MURKISON NO I DON'T WANT IT SAYS I LAY IT ON THE TABLE AND YOU SIT IN THAT CHAIR TILL IT TICKS OFF AN HOUR THEN YOU CAN GO IF YOU MAKE ANY NOISE OR LEAVE ANY SOONER
SMALL WONDER THEREFORE THAT THE ROMANTIC AND MYSTERIOUS PERSONALITY OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL WAS A SOURCE OF BITTER HATRED TO CHAUVELIN HE AND THE FEW YOUNG JACKANAPES UNDER HIS COMMAND WELL FURNISHED WITH MONEY ARMED WITH BOUNDLESS DARING
LUD LOVE ME SHE LOOKS VERY VIRTUOUS AND VERY MELANCHOLY FAITH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SHE REJOINED WITH A SMILE VIRTUE IS LIKE PRECIOUS ODOURS MOST FRAGRANT WHEN IT IS CRUSHED VIRTUE ALAS SIGHED THE PRINCE
MADAME HE ADDED BOWING CEREMONIOUSLY BEFORE MARGUERITE AH MY LITTLE CHAUVELIN SHE SAID WITH UNCONCERNED GAIETY AND EXTENDING HER TINY HAND TO HIM MONSIEUR AND I ARE OLD FRIENDS YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
CHAPTER ELEVEN LORD GRENVILLE'S BALL
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU THEY'D GO OUT OF BUSINESS THE GREEN GOODS MAN YOU WAS GOING TO ROB SAYS I STUDIED MAYBE FOR YEARS TO LEARN HIS TRADE
IF HE COULD STRIKE A RANCH A CAMP ANY PLACE WHERE HE COULD GET A FRESH HORSE AND INQUIRE THE ROAD HE WOULD RIDE ALL NIGHT TO GET BACK TO MARTHY AND THE KID SO I HAVE HINTED SAM WAS SEIZED BY REMORSE
AND THUS HE LOOKED UPON EVERY FRENCH ARISTOCRAT WHO HAD SUCCEEDED IN ESCAPING FROM FRANCE AS SO MUCH PREY OF WHICH THE GUILLOTINE HAD BEEN UNWARRANTABLY CHEATED THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THOSE ROYALIST EMIGRES ONCE THEY HAD MANAGED TO CROSS THE FRONTIER
BEFORE PREPARING TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS AT TEN O'CLOCK AN UNUSUALLY LATE HOUR IN THOSE DAYS THE GRAND ROOMS OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE EXQUISITELY DECORATED WITH EXOTIC PALMS AND FLOWERS WERE FILLED TO OVERFLOWING
IS DOUBLY WELCOME FOR HER SAKE HER FRIENDS ARE OUR FRIENDS HER ENEMIES THE ENEMIES OF ENGLAND MARGUERITE'S BLUE EYES HAD TWINKLED WITH MERRIMENT AT THIS GRACIOUS SPEECH FROM HER EXALTED FRIEND THE COMTESSE DE TOURNAY
ONE ROOM HAD BEEN SET APART FOR DANCING AND THE DAINTY STRAINS OF THE MINUET MADE A SOFT ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE GAY CHATTER THE MERRY LAUGHTER OF THE NUMEROUS AND BRILLIANT COMPANY IN A SMALLER CHAMBER FACING THE TOP OF THE FINE STAIRWAY
AH CHARMING CHARMING SAID THE PRINCE AND NOW ALLOW ME COMTESSE TO INTRODUCE YOU LADY BLAKENEY WHO HONOURS US WITH HER FRIENDSHIP YOU AND SHE WILL HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER I VOW EVERY COMPATRIOT OF LADY BLAKENEY'S
AH YES SAYS ANDY GAPING IT'S THE SAME OLD GAME I'VE OFTEN READ ABOUT IT IN THE PAPERS THEN HE CONDUCTS YOU TO THE PRIVATE ABATTOIR IN THE HOTEL WHERE MISTER JONES IS ALREADY WAITING
HAD JUST BEGUN TO FILTRATE ACROSS THE CHANNEL IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY HE HAD BEEN RECEIVED COURTEOUSLY BY HIS ENGLISH COLLEAGUES MISTER PITT HAD SHAKEN HIM BY THE HAND LORD GRENVILLE HAD ENTERTAINED HIM MORE THAN ONCE
AND CONSIDERED THE ARRIVALS WITH EMOTIONLESS EYES SHE HELD A BOOK IN HER LAP WITH HER FINGER HOLDING THE PLACE SAM SHOOK HIMSELF QUEERLY LIKE A MAN COMING OUT OF A DREAM AND SLOWLY DISMOUNTED
AS EASILY AS THAT OF ANY OTHER MAN SUDDENLY THERE WAS A GREAT STIR ON THE HANDSOME STAIRCASE ALL CONVERSATION STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AS THE MAJORDOMO'S VOICE OUTSIDE ANNOUNCED
AMUSES HIMSELF WITH PREMONITIONS AND ADVANCE PLEASANT RECOLLECTIONS IN A GRAY SUIT SAYS HE ON THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF WABASH AVENUE AND LAKE STREET HE DROPS THE PAPER
MAYBE IT WOULD TEACH EM A LESSON
CHAUVELIN HAD SWORN TO HIS COLLEAGUES IN PARIS THAT HE WOULD DISCOVER THE IDENTITY OF THAT MEDDLESOME ENGLISHMAN ENTICE HIM OVER TO FRANCE AND THEN
RANDY WOULD CRY AND CALL FOR DADA TO COME STILL THE INTERMINABLE SUCCESSION OF STRETCHES OF BRUSH CACTUS AND MESQUITE HOLLOW AFTER HOLLOW SLOPE AFTER SLOPE ALL EXACTLY ALIKE
OVER GLOWED THE SUMMER HEAT AS HE REMEMBERED THE MANY TIMES HE HAD FLOUTED AND RAILED AT HER BECAUSE SHE HAD A LIKING FOR READING FICTION THER ONLY SO'CE OV AMUSEMENT THER PO GAL'S GOT SAID SAM ALOUD WITH A SOB
NAY MONSEIGNEUR HE SAID NOW AS IF IN DIRECT RESPONSE
EVERYBODY WHO WAS ANYBODY HAD CONTRIVED TO BE IN LONDON IN TIME TO BE PRESENT THERE AND TO SHINE AT THIS BALL TO THE BEST OF HIS OR HER RESPECTIVE ABILITY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES HAD PROMISED TO BE PRESENT
HIS FAIR HAIR FREE FROM POWDER
WE WILL TRY TO FORGET THE GOVERNMENT THAT SENT YOU AND LOOK UPON YOU MERELY AS OUR GUEST A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN FROM FRANCE AS SUCH YOU ARE WELCOME MONSIEUR MONSEIGNEUR REJOINED CHAUVELIN BOWING ONCE AGAIN
IF BILL MURKISON GETS HIS EYES ONCE ON THEM BILLS THEY SHOW HIM
AT FIRST I WAS ABOUT TER BE A LITTLE RECKLESS AND KICK CAUSE THER BUTTONS WAS ALL OFF BUT SINCE I DISKIVER THAT THE BUTTON HOLES IS ALL BUSTED OUT WHY I WOULDN'T GO SO FUR AS TO SAY THE BUTTONS IS ANY LOSS TO SPEAK OF
SAM THOUGHT OF ROVING MARAUDING MEXICANS OF STEALTHY COUGARS THAT SOMETIMES INVADED THE RANCHES OF RATTLESNAKES CENTIPEDES AND A DOZEN POSSIBLE DANGERS MARTHY WOULD BE FRANTIC WITH FEAR
HE MOISTENED HIS DRY LIPS
SO HE HAD NEVER LEFT HER ALONE IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN SAM'S CONSCIENCE AWOKE
HE GAVE RANDY HIS THREE YEAR OLD SON A PAT ON THE HEAD AND HURRIED OUT TO WHERE MEXICO HIS FAVORITE SADDLE HORSE WAS STANDING
WHICH THE EXTRAVAGANT FASHION OF THE TIME DEMANDED AND THEN LAUGHING AND TALKING HAD DISPERSED IN THE BALL RECEPTION AND CARD ROOMS BEYOND NOT FAR FROM LORD GRENVILLE'S ELBOW
IN OUR IDLE HOURS WE ALWAYS IMPROVED OUR HIGHER SELVES BY RATIOCINATION AND MENTAL THOUGHT JEFF SAYS ANDY AFTER A LONG TIME
IS MORE AN ARTIFICIAL PRODUCT THAN A DIPLOMATIST IS
THE SUIT OF READY MADE EFFECTUALLY CONCEALED THE FINE LINES OF HIS STRAIGHT ATHLETIC FIGURE HIS BERRY BROWN FACE WAS SET TO THE MELANCHOLY DIGNITY BEFITTING A PRISONER OF STATE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT I HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING AND IF I AM SWIMMING UNDER THE WATER AND A DUCKLING PADDLES ALONG JUST ABOVE ME AND STICKS HIS FOOT INTO MY MOUTH I AM LIKELY TO SWALLOW HIM BEFORE I THINK THE WATER ADDER SAW THAT HE WAS PROVOKED BY WHAT SHE HAD SAID SO SHE TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
THE WALKING STICKS LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE BROTHER AND SISTER COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY IT WAS THE YOUNG GREEN ONE WHO SPOKE AT LAST
SHE PUT ME IN A VERY QUEER PRISON AT FIRST WHEN SHE PUT ME DOWN ON A STONE IN SOME WATER I DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS IN PRISON I TRIED TO HOP AWAY AND BUMP WENT MY HEAD AGAINST SOMETHING
HE PITIED SHORT NECKED PEOPLE THEN HE SAID POOH I CAN TAKE BIGGER MOUTHFULS THAN THAT YOU OUGHT TO SEE WHAT BIG MOUTHFULS I CAN TAKE SHE CHANGED AND STOOD ON HER OTHER LEG I SAW YOU DANCING THIS MORNING SHE SAID
HE WOULD BEND HIS BODY STRETCH OUT HIS NECK OPEN HIS LONG SLENDER BILL AND SWALLOW IT AT ONE GULP THEN HE WOULD SEEM TO FALL ASLEEP AGAIN WHILE MOST OF THE CRANES WERE STILL FEEDING SOME OF THEM WERE STALKING THROUGH THE WOODS AND LOOKING THIS WAY AND THAT
OUCH OUCH WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED THE MUD TURTLE THEN HE BEGAN TO SLAP THE WATER WITH HIS SHORT STOUT TAIL AND SAY OUCH
AND HE PULLED HIS TAIL OUT OF THE MUD AND SWAM AWAY
AH HE HAS THE TRUE WALKING STICK SPIRIT THEN THEY PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TO HIM AND AFTER A WHILE HE AND HIS SISTER AND THEIR GREEN LITTLE FRIEND LEFT THE FOREST FOR THE MEADOW ON THE DAY WHEN THE GRASS WAS CUT THEY HAD SAT QUIETLY IN THEIR TREES AND LOOKED GENTEEL
SHE STOOD WITH HER HEAD ON HER BREAST AND LOOKED AT THE WATER AFTER A WHILE HE TRUMPETED SOFTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE JUST TRYING HIS VOICE THEN SHE GAVE A PRETTY LITTLE START AND SAID OH ARE YOU HERE HOW YOU DID FRIGHTEN ME
THEY WERE A FINE COMPANY TO LOOK UPON ORDERLY STRONG AND DIGNIFIED THEIR LONG NECKS WERE STRETCHED OUT STRAIGHT AHEAD THEIR LONG LEGS STRAIGHT BEHIND AND THEY BEAT THE AIR WITH SLOW REGULAR STROKES OF THE STRONG WINGS
I AM SORRY HE SAID I DID NOT WANT TO FRIGHTEN YOU AND HE LOOKED AT HER ADMIRINGLY IT WAS JUST FOR A MINUTE SHE ANSWERED
IT IS USEFUL IN FEELING OF THINGS SHE SAID AND THEN I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT QUITE BECOMING SHE COULD SEE HERSELF REFLECTED IN THE STILL WATER BELOW HER AND SHE NOTICED HOW PRETTILY THE DARK BROWN OF HER BACK SHADED INTO THE WHITE OF HER BELLY
SOME MOTHERS DO NOT THINK IT TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE THEY LAY EGGS THAT MAY BE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK BUT THEY DO NOT BELONG TO OUR FAMILY SHE SPOKE AS IF THOSE WHO DID NOT BELONG TO HER FAMILY MIGHT BE GOOD BUT COULD NEVER BE GENTEEL
THAT WAS BECAUSE HE CRAWLED INTO A CLUMP OF FERNS AND KEPT VERY STILL HIS SISTER CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID NOW IF YOU WERE ONLY A SPIDER IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE YOU WOULD HAVE SIX LEGS AGAIN
AS YOU MAY GUESS I STAYED THERE A LONG TIME WATCHING THESE STRANGE CREATURES WORK
SHE HAD ONCE TOLD HER BROTHER THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK THAT SHE WOULD NOT WANT TO LIVE IF SHE COULD NOT BE GENTEEL SHE THOUGHT THE MEADOW PEOPLE VERY COMMON THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK LOOKED MUCH LIKE HIS SISTER HE HAD THE SAME LONG SLENDER BODY
IT IS JUST TO BE GENTEEL TO ACT AS YOU SEE US ACT AND TO JUST HERE THE HAY TEDDER PASSED OVER THEM AND EVERY ONE OF THE WALKING STICKS WAS SENT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR AND LANDED ON HIS BACK
I HOPPED ALONG AS FAST AS I COULD FOR I DID NOT THEN KNOW ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID I GOT CLOSE UP TO THEM BOTH AND SAW STRANGE BIG CREATURES GOING IN AND OUT OF THE RED THING THE BARN AS I AFTERWARD FOUND IT WAS CALLED
PERHAPS THEY WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR RELATIVES BUT THEN IF ONE IS A WALKING STICK YOU KNOW ONE DOES NOT CARE SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ONE'S FAMILY THESE WALKING STICKS HAD GROWN UP THE BEST WAY THEY COULD WITH NO FATHER OR MOTHER TO CARE FOR THEM
AS THEY CAME NEAR THE POND THEY FLEW LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL ALL SWEPT DOWN TO THE EARTH AND ALIGHTED TALL AND STATELY BY THE EDGE OF THE WATER THEY HAD EATEN NOTHING FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND WERE SOON HUNTING FOR FOOD SOME ON LAND
THEY HAD SUCH UGLY MOUTHS AND SUCH QUICK MOTIONS THE LARGER FISHES KEPT AWAY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO WERE SMALL AND TENDER ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THE SAND HILL CRANES THE FISH HAWKS AND THE OTHER SHORE FAMILIES WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS FOR THEM BUT WHEN THEY CALLED
AND WHEN THEY HAD SLEPT ENOUGH THEY AWAKENED THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO EAT AND SLEEP AND THEY DID NOT OFTEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO THINK THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THOSE MEADOW PEOPLE WHO RUSHED AND SCRAMBLED AND WORKED FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT AND THEY SHOWED VERY PLAINLY HOW THEY FELT
I PLAYED AND ATE WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND LITTLE DREAMED WHAT TROUBLE WAS IN STORE FOR ME WHEN I GREW UP WE WERE ALL IN A HURRY TO BE FROGS
AND I COULD HEAR A ROARING SOUND WHICH MEANT THEY WERE TALKING AND LAUGHING THE LAST TIME I GOT OUT
OR IF THEY HAD BEEN FLYING BY NIGHT AS THEY USUALLY DID THEY WOULD HAVE STAYED NEARER THE GROUND AND THEIR LEADER WOULD HAVE TRUMPETED LOUDLY TO LET HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW WHICH WAY HE WAS GOING THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TRUMPETED BUT MORE SOFTLY TO TELL HIM THAT THEY WERE COMING AFTER
THAT WAS BELOSTOMA'S WAY HE WOULD STING PEOPLE WHO BOTHERED HIM BUT THEN HE ALWAYS SAID THAT THEY NEED NOT HAVE BOTHERED HIM AND PERHAPS THAT WAS SO WITH THE WATER ADDERS IT WAS DIFFERENT THEY WERE GOOD NATURED ENOUGH
LET US GO OFF INTO THE WOODS AND REST YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WAS GLAD TO GO AND AS HE STALKED OFF WITH HER HE LED THE WAY TO A CHARMING NESTING PLACE HE DIDN'T KNOW JUST HOW TO TELL WHAT HE WANTED TO BUT HE HAD SEEN ANOTHER CRANE BOWING TO HER
I DID HAVE WHEN I WAS A TADPOLE SAID THE TREE FROG I HAD A BEAUTIFUL WIGGLY LITTLE TAIL WITH WHICH TO SWIM THROUGH THE WATERS OF THE POND BUT AS MY LEGS GREW LARGER AND STRONGER MY TAIL GREW LITTLER AND WEAKER UNTIL THERE WASN'T ANY TAIL LEFT
SHE PICKED ME UP AND CARRIED ME INSIDE OH HOW FRIGHTENED I WAS MY HEART THUMPED AS THOUGH IT WOULD BURST AND I TRIED MY BEST TO GET AWAY FROM HER SHE DIDN'T HURT ME AT ALL BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET ME GO
EVERY CRANE DANCED BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL AND AS THEY DID SO THEY LOOKED LOVINGLY AT EACH OTHER AND ADMIRED THE FINE STEPS AND ENJOYED THE WHOOPING THIS WENT ON UNTIL THEY WERE SO TIRED THEY COULD HARDLY STAND AND HAD TO STOP TO EAT AND REST
AND WAS AFRAID SHE MIGHT MARRY HIM IF HE WAS NOT QUICK NOW HE POINTED WITH ONE WING TO THIS NESTING PLACE AND SAID HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUILD A NEST THERE SHE LOOKED WHERE HE HAD POINTED I SHE SAID WHY
AFTER THEY STOPPED HUNTING THE WIND BLEW THE DOOR OPEN AND I HOPPED OUT YOU DON'T SAY EXCLAIMED A GRASSHOPPER
WHEN THEY WERE EATING THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEGUN THE DANCE STALKED UP TO THE SISTER OF ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AS SHE STOOD IN THE EDGE OF THE POND GRACEFULLY BALANCED ON ONE LEG SHE DID NOT TURN HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM ALTHOUGH HAVING SUCH A LONG AND SLENDER NECK
THE SAME LONG FEELERS AND THE SAME SORT OF LONG SLENDER LEGS IF YOU HAD PASSED THEM IN A HAY FIELD YOU WOULD SURELY HAVE THOUGHT EACH A STEM OF HAY UNLESS YOU HAPPENED TO SEE THEM MOVE THE OTHER WALKING STICK THEIR FRIEND WAS YOUNGER AND GREEN
LET THEM COME IN SWIMMING WITH THEIR CHILDREN IF THEY ARE WARM AND TIRED THE WATER ADDER LAUGHED IN HER SNAKY WAY AND SHOWED HER SHARP TEETH I HAVE HEARD SHE SAID THAT WHEN THE WILD DUCKS BRING THEIR CHILDREN HERE TO SWIM
FOR ALL THE EIGHT CRANES HAD DANCED TOGETHER BUT HE THOUGHT IT VERY WONDERFUL DID YOU NOTICE TO WHOM I BOWED HE ASKED HE WAS SO EXCITED THAT HIS KNEES SHOOK AND HE HAD TO STAND ON BOTH LEGS AT ONCE TO KEEP FROM FALLING
THEIR FEELERS WERE HELD QUITE CLOSE TOGETHER AND THEY DID NOT MOVE THEIR FEET AT ALL ONLY SWAYED THEIR BODIES GRACEFULLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE NOW THEY WERE ON THE GROUND HUNTING THROUGH THE FLAT PILES OF CUT GRASS FOR SOME FRESH AND JUICY BITS TO EAT
SAID THE MUD TURTLE AND HE SWAM AWAY WITH THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHAT A RUDE PERSON SHE IS THEY SAID ALWAYS TRYING TO SHOW HOW MUCH MORE CLEVER SHE IS THAN OTHER PEOPLE WE WOULD RATHER BE STUPID AND POLITE AFTER A WHILE THE SNAPPING TURTLE SAID
THEN HE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE LIKED THE PLACE SO WELL SHE MIGHT COME THERE AGAIN THE NEXT DAY HE WONDERED WHY HE COULD NOT COME TOO ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT A CRANE CATCHES MORE IF HE FISHES ALONE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE CRANES DANCED
CATCH HOLD OF THINGS WITH HER TAIL HANG HERSELF FROM THE BRANCH OF A TREE LIFT HER HEAD FAR INTO THE AIR LEAP DART BOUND AND DIVE ALL HER FAMILY COULD DO THESE THINGS BUT SHE COULD DO THEM A LITTLE THE BEST ONE DAY SHE WAS HANGING OVER THE POND IN A VERY GRACEFUL POSITION
THE QUEEREST THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THE SMALLER CREATURES SEEMED TO MAKE THE LARGER ONES DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED THEM TO THEY EVEN MADE SOME OF THEM HELP DO THEIR WORK YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME BUT WHAT I TELL YOU IS TRUE
IF HE HAD BEEN AN OLDER CRANE AND UNDERSTOOD THE WAYS OF THE WORLD A LITTLE BETTER HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE MEANT AREN'T YOU COMING TO THAT FISHING PLACE I AM GOING NOW
STILL ALTHOUGH HE WAS SUCH A YOUNG CRANE AND HAD NEVER DANCED UNTIL THIS YEAR HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT SHE LIKED HIM AND ENJOYED HAVING HIM NEAR SO HE FLEW OFF TO THE FISHING PLACE WHERE HE HAD SEEN HER THE DAY BEFORE AND HE STALKED ALONG TO WHERE SHE WAS
IT IS A LOVELY PLACE BUT I COULD NEVER HAVE A NEST ALONE LET ME HELP YOU HE SAID I WANT TO MARRY AND HAVE A HOME WHY SAID SHE AS SHE PREENED HER FEATHERS THAT IS A VERY GOOD PLAN
THE CLEVER WATER ADDER NONE OF THE POND PEOPLE WERE ALONE MORE THAN THE WATER ADDERS THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL UNTIL THE DAY WHEN HE AND BELOSTOMA DROVE AWAY THE BOYS AFTER THAT
OH HOW HAPPY WE WERE THEN I REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN MY HIND LEGS BEGAN TO GROW AND HOW THE OTHER TADPOLES CROWDED AROUND ME IN THE WATER AND SWAM CLOSE TO ME TO FEEL THE TWO LITTLE BUNCHES THAT WERE TO BE LEGS
I WAS HATCHED IN THE POND BEYOND THE FARM HOUSE AND ATE MY WAY FROM THE EGG TO THE WATER OUTSIDE LIKE ANY OTHER FROG PERHAPS I OUGHT TO SAY LIKE ANY OTHER TADPOLE FOR OF COURSE I BEGAN LIFE AS A TADPOLE
I NEVER WORRY ABOUT MINE SAID THE MUD TURTLE ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER THINKS IT IS NOT SAFE FOR THEM ALL TO SLEEP AT ONCE AS THEY DO ON A LOG IN THE SUNSHINE IT ISN'T SAID THE ADDER DECIDEDLY I NEVER CLOSE MY EYES
YET THE MUD TURTLES AND SNAPPING TURTLE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO EVER CALLED UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM AT HOME THE SMALL PEOPLE WITHOUT SHELLS WERE AFRAID OF THEM AND THE CLAMS AND POND SNAILS NEVER CALLED UPON ANY ONE THE MINNOWS SAID THEY COULD NOT BEAR THE LOOKS OF THE ADDERS
ONE DAY WHEN MANY OF THE MEADOW PEOPLE WERE GATHERED AROUND HIM HE TOLD THEM HIS STORY WHEN I WAS A LITTLE FELLOW HE SAID I WAS STRONG AND WELL AND COULD LEAP FARTHER THAN ANY OTHER FROG OF MY SIZE
THE KNOBS ON THE ENDS OF MY TOES WERE STICKY SO THAT I COULD CLIMB A TREE AND THEN I WAS READY TO START ON MY TRAVELS SOME OF THE OTHER FROGS STARTED WITH ME BUT THEY STOPPED ALONG THE WAY AND AT LAST I WAS ALONE
I HAD ENOUGH TO EAT BUT ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN FREE CANNOT BE HAPPY SHUT IN I WATCHED MY CHANCE AND THREE TIMES I GOT OUT WHEN THE LITTLE DOOR WAS NOT QUITE CLOSED TWICE I WAS CAUGHT AND PUT BACK
AND FLY AROUND IN THE SUNSHINE TO FIND FOOD FOR THEIR CHILDREN AH YES SAID THE MUD TURTLE HOW THEY MUST WISH FOR SHELLS HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHAT FOR TO FLY WITH
AND THAT HE HAD A BAD HABIT OF USING HIS STOUT SUCKING TUBE TO STING WITH STILL BELOSTOMA DID NOT CARE HE SAID A GIANT WATER BUG DOES NOT ALWAYS LIVE IN THE WATER I SHALL HAVE MY WINGS SOON AND LEAVE THE WATER AND MARRY
WHEN DID YOU THINK OF IT SO THEY WERE MARRIED AND MISSUS SAND HILL CRANE OFTEN TOLD HER FRIENDS AFTERWARD THAT MISTER CRANE WAS SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT SHE JUST HAD TO MARRY HIM THEY WERE VERY VERY HAPPY AND AFTER A WHILE
THEY WERE THOSE WHO THOUGHT OF STAYING THERE FOR THE SUMMER WHEN THE FLOCK AROSE TO FLY ON AGAIN EIGHT CRANES STAYED BEHIND THEY WATCHED THEIR FRIENDS FLY AWAY AND STOOD ON THE GROUND WITH THEIR NECKS AND BILLS UPLIFTED AND MOUTHS OPEN
AND THEIR LONG LEGS GAVE THEM A VERY GENTEEL LOOK THE TOPS OF THEIR HEADS WERE COVERED WITH WARTY RED SKIN FROM WHICH GREW SHORT BLACK FEATHERS THAT LOOKED MORE LIKE HAIRS ONE MORNING WHEN THE CRANES AWAKENED
AND ONE CRANE KEPT AWAKE TO WATCH FOR DANGER WHILE THE OTHERS TUCKED THEIR HEADS UNDER THEIR WINGS THEY WERE FINE LOOKING EVEN WHEN THEY SLEPT AND SOME PEOPLE NEVER LOOK WELL UNLESS THEY ARE AWAKE THEY WERE BROWNISH GRAY WITH NO BRIGHT MARKINGS AT ALL
WHEN A CRANE IS AS MUCH EXCITED AS THAT IT IS PRETTY SERIOUS TO MY SISTER SHE ASKED CARELESSLY AS SHE DREW ONE OF HER LONG TAIL FEATHERS THROUGH HER BEAK NO SAID HE I BOWED TO HER SISTER
WHEN THE HORSE WAS WELL INTO THE MEADOW THE FARMER MOVED A BAR AND THE QUEER LOOKING MACHINE BEGAN TO KICK THE GRASS THIS WAY AND THAT WITH ITS MANY STIFF AND SHINING LEGS A FRISKY YOUNG GRASSHOPPER KICKED IN THE SAME WAY AND HAPPENED JUST HAPPENED OF COURSE
MOST OF THEM REMARKED THE TURTLES ALL OF THEM SHE SAID EXCEPT US ADDERS AND THE TURTLES I EVEN THINK THAT SOME OF THE TURTLES ARE A LITTLE QUEER DON'T YOU WE HAVE THOUGHT SO SAID THE MUD TURTLE
THEY DO NOT ALWAYS TAKE SO MANY HOME AS THEY BROUGHT THE SNAPPING TURTLE BECAME VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HIS WARTY RIGHT FORELEG AND DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID THE MUD TURTLE SMILED I HAVE HEARD SHE WENT ON
AND SOME IN THE WATER FOR THEY HAD STOPPED TO FEED AND REST THOSE WHO HUNTED IN THE WATER DID SO VERY QUIETLY A CRANE WOULD STAND ON ONE LEG WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST HIS BREAST SO QUIETLY THAT ONE MIGHT THINK HIM ASLEEP BUT AS SOON AS ANYTHING EATABLE CAME NEAR
EVEN THE FROGS WHO ARE AFRAID OF CRANES CREPT QUIETLY NEAR TO LOOK ON IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE ANOTHER YOUNG CRANE BEGAN TO SKIP AND HOP AND CIRCLE AROUND DROOPING HIS WINGS AND WHOOPING AS HE WENT
WITH HER TAIL TWISTED CARELESSLY AROUND A WILLOW BRANCH THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND A MUD TURTLE FATHER WERE IN THE SHALLOW WATER BELOW HER HER SLENDER FORKED TONGUE WAS DARTING IN AND OUT OF HER OPEN MOUTH
A FINE YOUNG FELLOW BEGAN TO STRUT UP AND DOWN BEFORE THE REST BOWING LOW AND LEAPING HIGH INTO THE AIR AND EVERY NOW AND THEN WHOOPING AS LOUDLY AS HE COULD THE GULLS WHO HAD SPENT THE WINTER BY THE POND SCREAMED TO EACH OTHER THE CRANE DANCE HAS BEGUN
I WISH SAID HE THAT THE CHILLY FEELING WOULD BE BIG ENOUGH TO GO WAY THROUGH TO THEIR BELLIES THEIR BELLIES ARE ONLY THE FRONT SIDE OF THEIR BACKS ANYWAY HE ADDED BECAUSE THEY ARE SO THIN OF COURSE THIS WAS A DREADFUL WISH TO MAKE
AND SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER THAT SHE NEVER COULD REMEMBER WHAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN IT MADE HIM FEEL VERY BADLY TO HAVE HER LEAVE HIM SO HE WANTED A CHANCE TO TELL HER SOMETHING YET WHENEVER HE TRIED TO IT SEEMED TO STICK IN HIS BILL HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE HIM
THEN THERE WAS A GREAT SCRAMBLING AND THE CRICKETS FROLICKED WITH THEM THE YOUNG WALKING STICK THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE GREAT FUN AND ALMOST WISHED HERSELF SOME OTHER KIND OF INSECT SO THAT SHE COULD TUMBLE AROUND IN THE SAME WAY SHE DID NOT QUITE WISH IT YOU UNDERSTAND
DO YOU NEVER FIX A PLACE FOR YOUR EGGS A PLACE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK WAVING HER LONG AND SLENDER FEELERS TO AND FRO A PLACE OH NO I THINK THEY WILL HATCH WHERE THEY ARE IT IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO FIND A PLACE
THEY CERTAINLY ARE AGREED THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MUCH BETTER NATURED WHAT DID YOU SAY ASKED THE ADDER WHO LIKE ALL HER FAMILY WAS A LITTLE DEAF OUCH EXCLAIMED THE SNAPPING TURTLE
I THINK THE DUCKS SPOIL THEIR CHILDREN SAID SHE THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS OVER THEM AND THEY ARE NOT NEARLY SO BRIGHT AS MY CHILDREN WHY MINE HATCH AS SOON AS THE EGGS ARE LAID AND GO HUNTING AT ONCE THEY ARE NO TROUBLE AT ALL
TWO NAUGHTY YOUNG WATER BOATMEN HAD SWUM QUIETLY UP ON THEIR BACKS AND STUNG THE TURTLES ON THEIR TAILS THEN THEY SWAM AWAY PUSHING THEMSELVES QUICKLY THROUGH THE WATER WITH SWIFT STROKES OF THEIR HAIRY OAR LEGS
AND WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IT IF SHE HAD TURNED BROWN AH SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK WHAT SCRAMBLING HOW VERY COMMON YES INDEED SAID HIS SISTER WHY CAN'T THEY LEARN TO MOVE SLOWLY AND GRACEFULLY
THE DIGNIFIED WALKING STICKS THREE WALKING STICKS FROM THE FOREST HAD COME TO LIVE IN THE BIG MAPLE TREE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE MEADOW NOBODY KNEW EXACTLY WHY THEY HAD LEFT THE FOREST WHERE ALL THEIR SISTERS AND COUSINS AND AUNTS LIVED
HE KNEW JUST WHAT TO EXPECT SO WHEN THE NUTHATCH SET HIM DOWN ON THE BARK TO LOOK AT HIM HE UNHOOKED HIS FEET FROM THE BARK AND TUMBLED TO THE GROUND THE NUTHATCH TRIED TO CATCH HIM AND BROKE OFF ONE OF HIS LEGS BUT SHE NEVER FOUND HIM AGAIN ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED
THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO DO ANYTHING USEFUL OR TO THINK MUCH ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE HUNGRY THEY ATE SOME LEAVES AND NEVER THOUGHT WHAT THEY SHOULD EAT THE NEXT TIME THAT THEY HAPPENED TO BE HUNGRY WHEN THEY WERE TIRED THEY WENT TO SLEEP
HIS NEIGHBORS BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER AND HE WAS LESS GRUMPY SO THAT THOSE WHO WORE SHELLS WERE SOON QUITE FOND OF HIM BELOSTOMA DID NOT HAVE MANY FRIENDS AMONG THE SMALLER PEOPLE AND ONLY A FEW AMONG THE LARGER ONES THEY SAID THAT HE WAS CRUEL
YOU SEE SHE WAS VAIN AS WELL AS CLEVER THE SNAPPING TURTLE FELT CROSS TO DAY AND HAD COME TO SEE IF A TALK WITH HER WOULD NOT MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER THE MUD TURTLE WAS TIRED OF HAVING THE CHILDREN SPRAWL AROUND HIM
ASKED THE WATER ADDER IN HER SWEETEST VOICE NOTHING IS EASIER AND SHE WOUND HERSELF AROUND THE WILLOW BRANCH IN ANOTHER GRACEFUL POSITION AND TOOK THE TIP OF HER TAIL DAINTILY BETWEEN HER TEETH HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE
WHILE THEY TRUMPETED OR CALLED OUT GOOD BYE STOP FOR US IN THE FALL THE FLYING CRANES TRUMPETED BACK WE WILL DON'T FORGET US THAT NIGHT THEY SLEPT NEAR TOGETHER AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN WITH THE LARGE FLOCK
AFTER THAT I SHALL FLY AWAY ON MY WEDDING TRIP MISSUS BELOSTOMA MAY GO WITH ME IF SHE FEELS LIKE DOING SO AFTER LAYING HER EGGS HERE I SHALL GO ANYWAY AND I SHALL FLUTTER AND SPRAWL AROUND THE LIGHT AND STING PEOPLE WHO BOTHER ME AND HAVE A HAPPY TIME
THAT WHEN YOUNG DUCKS DIVE HEAD FIRST THEY ARE QUITE SURE TO COME UP AGAIN BUT THAT WHEN THEY DIVE FEET FIRST THEY NEVER COME UP
BUT FOR A LONG TIME I COULD NOT SLEEP WITHOUT DREAMING THAT I WAS BACK IN PRISON AND I WOULD CROAK IN MY SLEEP AT THE THOUGHT OF IT I HEARD YOU CRIED THE KATYDID AND I WONDERED WHAT WAS THE MATTER MATTER ENOUGH SAID THE TREE FROG
IT MAKES MY SKIN DRY TO THINK OF IT NOW AND FRIENDS THE BEST WAY I CAN EVER REPAY YOUR KINDNESS TO ME IS TO TELL YOU TO NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER GO NEAR THE FARM HOUSE AND THEY ALL ANSWERED
AND THE NEXT TIME THE CRANES DANCED HE DIDN'T BOW TO HER SO MUCH BUT HE STRUTTED AND LEAPED AND WHOOPED EVEN MORE AND SHE STRUTTED AND LEAPED AND WHOOPED ALMOST AS LOUDLY AS HE WHEN THEY WERE ALL TIRED OUT AND HAD STOPPED DANCING SHE SAID TO HIM I AM SO TIRED
AS SHE STALKED OFF TOWARD THE POND SHE PASSED HIM AND SHE SAID OVER HER SHOULDER I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD BE HUNGRY I AM ALMOST STARVED AFTER SHE HAD GONE HE WONDERED WHY SHE HAD SAID THAT
THEN THEY STOOD AND FISHED FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING WHEN SHE FLEW AWAY SHE SAID THAT IS A VERY PLEASANT FISHING PLACE HE STOOD ON THE OTHER LEG FOR A WHILE AND THOUGHT HOW SWEET HER VOICE SOUNDED AS SHE SAID IT
THE DANCE OF THE SAND HILL CRANES ONE FINE DAY IN SPRING A GREAT FLOCK OF SAND HILL CRANES CAME FROM THE SOUTH THEY WERE FLYING HIGH AND QUIETLY BECAUSE THE WEATHER WAS BRIGHT IF IT HAD BEEN STORMY
OF COURSE YOU KNOW SPIDERS NEVER DO HAVE A HUNDRED AND A WALKING STICK WOULDN'T BE WALKING WITHOUT ANY BUT THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY OF SPEAKING AND IT SHOWED WHAT KIND OF INSECT HE WAS HIS RELATIVES ALL WAVED THEIR FEELERS ONE AT A TIME AND SAID
BUT THEN YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT STUPID OF COURSE NOT REPLIED THE MUD TURTLE
PERHAPS THEY CAN'T HELP BEING FAT BUT THEY MIGHT AT LEAST ACT GENTEEL WHAT IS IT TO BE GENTEEL ASKED A GRASSHOPPER SUDDENLY HE HAD HEARD EVERY WORD THAT THE WALKING STICK SAID WHY SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK
MY FORE LEGS DID NOT GROW UNTIL LATER AND THESE BUNCHES CAME JUST IN FRONT OF MY TAIL YOUR TAIL CRIED A PUZZLED YOUNG CRICKET
NONE OF HIS FRIENDS HAD KNOWN HIM THEN BUT HE WAS AN HONEST FELLOW AND THEY WERE SURE THAT EVERYTHING HE TOLD WAS TRUE BESIDES THEY MUST BE TRUE FOR HOW COULD A BODY EVER THINK OUT SUCH REMARKABLE TALES FROM HIS OWN HEAD
AND HE BACKED INTO THE MUD KNOWING THAT FINE SOFT MUD IS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR STINGS
WONDERFUL INDEED AND AT THE TOP CONTINUED THE TREE FROG WAS SOMETHING WHITE OVER THE DOORWAY INTO MY PRISON IN THE BOTTOM WERE WATER AND A STONE AND FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP WAS A LADDER
IN THE PLEASANT WEATHER OF COURSE I WENT TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER AND WHEN IT WAS GOING TO RAIN I WOULD GO DOWN AGAIN EVERY TIME THAT I WENT UP OR DOWN THOSE DREADFUL CREATURES WOULD PUT THEIR FACES UP CLOSE TO MY PRISON
HE BOWED TO HER OFTENER THAN TO ANY OF THE REST AND HE THOUGHT SHE NOTICED IT THEY DANCED UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST TOO TIRED TO MOVE
SHE COULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING AND SHE KNEW IT SHE TALKED ABOUT IT TOO AND THAT SHOWED BAD TASTE AND WAS ONE REASON WHY SHE WAS NOT LIKED BETTER SHE COULD SWIM VERY FAST COULD CREEP GLIDE
THE LARGEST CREATURES HAD FOUR LEGS AND SOME OF THEM HAD HORNS THE SMALLER CREATURES HAD ONLY TWO LEGS ON WHICH TO WALK AND TWO OTHER LIMBS OF SOME SORT WITH WHICH THEY LIFTED AND CARRIED THINGS
THERE WERE SOME BRIGHT COLORED FLOWERS NEAR THE HOUSE AND I CRAWLED IN AMONG THEM THERE I RESTED UNTIL SUNSET AND THEN BEGAN MY EVENING SONG WHILE I WAS SINGING ONE OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE HOUSE CAME OUT AND FOUND ME
ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS OF WHICH HE TOLD HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE CAME TO THE MEADOW
AND OF MISSUS MUD TURTLE TELLING ABOUT THE TROUBLE SHE HAD TO GET THE RIGHT KIND OF FOOD THE CLEVER WATER ADDER SPOKE FIRST OF THE WEATHER IT MUST BE DREADFULLY HOT FOR THE SHORE PEOPLE SHE SAID
WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO HIS HOME BY THE ELM TREE HE WAS VERY THIN AND LOOKED AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SICK THE KATYDIDS WHO STAYED NEAR SAID THAT HE CROAKED IN HIS SLEEP AND THAT YOU KNOW IS NOT WHAT WELL AND HAPPY FROGS SHOULD DO
IN ALL THE MEADOW THERE WAS NOBODY WHO COULD TELL SUCH INTERESTING STORIES AS THE OLD TREE FROG EVEN THE GARTER SNAKE WHO HAD BEEN THERE THE LONGEST AND THE OLD CRICKET WHO HAD LIVED IN THE FARM YARD COULD TELL NO SUCH EXCITING TALES AS THE TREE FROG
ASKED THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND HE WAS SNAPPY ABOUT IT OH NOTHING REPLIED THE WATER ADDER SWINGING HER HEAD BACK AND FORTH AND LOOKING AT THE SCALES ON HER BODY I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE
THE ADDERS WERE ALWAYS AWAY PEOPLE SAID THAT THE ADDERS WERE AFRAID OF THEM THE YELLOW BROWN FROG WISHED THAT THE ADDERS COULD BE SCARED BADLY SCARED SOME TIME SO SCARED THAT A CHILLY FEELING WOULD RUN DOWN THEIR BACKS FROM THEIR HEADS CLEAR TO THE TIPS OF THEIR TAILS
I WAS A BOLD YOUNG FELLOW AND WHEN I SAW A GREAT WHITE THING AMONG THE TREES UP YONDER I MADE UP MY MIND TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THERE WAS A GREAT RED THING IN THE YARD BESIDE IT BUT I LIKED THE WHITE ONE BETTER
THEY SAID IT WAS NOT GENTEEL TO HURRY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED ONE DAY THE TREE FROG WAS UNDER THE TREE WHEN THE LARGE BROWN WALKING STICK DECIDED TO LAY SOME EGGS HE SAW HER DROPPING THEM CARELESSLY AROUND ON THE GROUND AND ASKED
THE ANTS WERE SCRAMBLING AROUND AS BUSY AS EVER AND LIFE WENT ON QUITE AS THOUGH NEITHER MEN NOR HORSES HAD EVER ENTERED THE MEADOW SEE CRIED A SPIDER WHO WAS BUSILY LOOKING AFTER HER WEB THERE COMES A HORSE DRAWING SOMETHING AND THE FARMER SITTING ON IT AND DRIVING
BUT PEOPLE SAID THAT ONE OF THE ADDERS HAD FRIGHTENED THE YELLOW BROWN FROG SO THAT HE NEVER GOT OVER IT AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE FELT SO THE WATER ADDERS WERE CERTAINLY THE CLEVEREST PEOPLE IN THE POND
IF I COULD ONLY REACH MY TAIL WITH MY HEAD OR EVEN WITH ONE OF MY HIND FEET
I THINK SO JIM SAID LUCILLE YOU'RE NOT REMEMBERING HIM AFTER ALL NO JIM I WAS THINKING OF POOR CAIN HE DIED FOR ME BUT THAT WAS TWELVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO MY DEAR AND TO DAY'S TO DAY SAID JIM
LUCILLE SHOUTING HER NAME JIM BEGAN TO ASCEND THE STAIRS IN LEAPS OF THREE AT A TIME BUT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED THE TOP HE WAS ASCENDING ONE BY ONE WITH STRAINING LIMBS AND LABORING BREATH RED SLAUGHTER DOWN BELOW
ONE FLIGHT MORE ONE MORE ANOTHER SUDDENLY HE REALIZED THAT HIS TASK WAS ENDED IN PLACE OF THE STAIRS STOOD A VAST HALL AND BEYOND THAT ANOTHER HALL DIM IN THE FAINT LIGHT THAT FILTERED THROUGH THE GLASS ABOVE
THAT TOOK A WHOLE YEAR SAID TODE THAT PRETTY LITTLE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION WE'VE JUST WITNESSED THE GOOD OLD ATOM SMASHER HAS BEEN DOING SOME LIVELY STUNTS OR WE'D HAVE BEEN ENGULFED TOO WE'RE NOT LIKELY TO SEE ANYTHING SO PRETTY IN HISTORY AGAIN
HE HURLED HIMSELF INTO THE MIDST OF THE CROWD AND SWEPT IT BACK HE WAS WITHIN THE WALLS NOW AND STRUGGLING TO PASS THROUGH THE MOB OF PEOPLE THAT WAS SWARMING LIKE HOMELESS BEES HE FOUGHT THEM WITH FLAILING FISTS HE CLOVE A PATHWAY THROUGH THEM
TILL OF A SUDDEN THE PORTALS LOOMED BEFORE HIM AND HE SAW A CROWD OF FRENZIED ATLANTEANS STRUGGLING TO PASS THROUGH AND A FILE OF SOLDIERS STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEM BACK HE COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING MORE THAN THE CONFUSED STRUGGLE
JIM SAW HIM NOW A FIGURE POISED UPON A PLATFORM BEHIND THE ARMS HIS OWN ARMS RAISED HEAVENWARD
UNLESS WE GO TO WATCH THE DESTRUCTION OF HERCULANEUM AND POMPEII BY LAVA FROM VESUVIUS BUT THAT WOULD BE QUITE TAME IN COMPARISON WITH THIS TODE'S JEERING TONE GRATED ON JIM'S EARS IMMEASURABLY
YET HE HARDLY CHECKED THE RACING THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS MIND EVEN FOR A MOMENT TO MEDITATE ON WHAT HE HAD DONE THOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALL OF LUCILLE HE MUST GET TO HER BEFORE THE DRILGOES ENTERED AND HE RAN FASTER PANTING GASPING
YOU REMEMBER HOW POOR CAIN SEEMED TO TAKE GREAT INTEREST IN THE ATOM SMASHER THERE'S NO WAY OF TELLING WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON IN THAT BRAIN OF HIS BUT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE HE'D KNOWN THAT THAT LEVER MEANT DEATH
A ROAR THAT SEEMED TO REND THE HEAVENS FOLLOWED ROAR UPON ROAR AS THE INFINITE MOMENTUM OF THE DISINTEGRATING URANIUM STRUCK OBSTACLE AFTER OBSTACLE THE DRILGOES VANISHED
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE BUT MY IMPRESSION OF IT IS THAT IT'S A FAIRLY GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE PLACE POPULARLY KNOWN AS HELL YOU FOOL DENT TODE'S VOICE RANG OUT WITH VICIOUS SNARLING EMPHASIS I GAVE YOU YOUR CHANCE TO COME IN WITH ME
SUDDENLY A TREMENDOUS UPROAR FILLED THE STREETS YELLS THE CLICKING GRUNTS OF THE DRILGOES THE SCREAMS OF THE PANIC STRICKEN POPULACE THE INVADERS HAD ARRIVED AND THEY WERE SWEEPING ALL BEFORE THEM NO CHANCE OF RECOGNITION IN THAT DARKNESS
WELL MISTER DENT MY WIFE AND ME SURE WERE GLAD TO BE ON THE SPOT WHEN YOU AND MISS PARRISH GOT BOGGED ON THE EDGE OF THE BLACK POOL HE SAID MEAN TREACHEROUS PLACE IT IS THAR WAS A COW GOT MIRED THAR LAST MONTH UP TO HER BELLY IF US HADN'T FOUND HER
LET'S THINK NO MORE ABOUT HIM SAID LUCILLE SHE HAD COME UP TO THEM AND THE TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SMILED LOVE IS SELF CENTRED OTHER THINGS IT FORGETS VERY QUICKLY TO MORROW WE GO BACK TO NEW YORK SAID JIM
COME MAKE YOUR CHOICE DENT HE MOCKED IT'S MERELY TO PRESS THIS LEVER YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF WELL WE WON'T GO INTO THAT I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF YOU'LL DISAPPEAR SO SHALL I BUT I'M DESPERATE
AND LOUDER ABOVE THE SOUND OF WAILING CAME THE ROARS OF THE DRILGOES SWARMING ALONG THE CAUSEWAY SUDDENLY SOMETHING GAVE BEHIND HIM A DOOR AS IT SEEMED BROKEN OFF ITS HINGES BY THE MOB PRESSURE JIM WAS HURLED BACKWARD
JIM CAUGHT LUCILLE IN HIS ARMS SHOUTING HER NAME SHE KNEW HIM TURNED TOWARD HIM THEN ONE OF THE PRIESTS ARMED WITH A GREAT STONE HEADED CLUB FOR NO METAL IS PERMITTED WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF THE GOD CRUK
MADE ME AND MY WIFE UNEASY THAT DID ANDY SHE SAYS I GOT AN INKLING YOU OUGHTER GO TO THE VANISHING PLACE AND SEE IF SHE AIN'T THERE AND THERE I FOUND YOU TWO MIRED TO THE WAIST AND MISTER PARRISH DANCING AROUND AND FRETTING
HOWEVER THE SENSIBLE THING IS TO LET BYGONES BE BYGONES BUT WE MUST MAKE A LITTLE EXCURSION
BUT OF A SUDDEN LUCILLE'S SCREAM RANG OUT ABOVE THE DIN BELOW WITH THREE LEAPS JIM WAS AT HER SIDE HE SAW THE GIRL TODE AND PARRISH STRUGGLING IN THE GRASP OF A DOZEN PRIESTS THEY WERE DRAGGING THEM TOWARD THE IDOLS
RECHARGING THEMSELVES WITH THE FEEL OF EARTH UNTIL THE MEMORY OF THOSE DREAD EXPERIENCES GREW DIM WELL JIM I RECKON I'D BETTER TELL YOU AND GET IT OVER SAID OLD PARRISH ONE MORNING PARRISH QUITE HIS OLD JAUNTY SELF AGAIN
UTTER IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS REIGNED AND EVEN THE GIBBOUS MOON FLOATING OVERHEAD SEEMED TO GIVE NO LIGHT JIM DROPPED TO THE CAUSEWAY AND BEGAN RUNNING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY
THANK YOU HE ANSWERED SCOWLING BUT SERIOUSLY DENT WE CAN'T GO BACK WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR ALL OUR TROUBLE THOSE FOOLS TRIED TO BETRAY ME AND THEN THE EYE WENT OUT PERHAPS I HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR THAT PERFORMANCE
IT BURNED HIM TO A FEW GREASE SPOTS HE SIMPLY VANISHED YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID AT THE MOMENT BOY I DON'T SEEM TO REMEMBER ANYTHING SAID JIM WELL YOUR RESPONSE WAS AN AUTOMATIC ONE YOU JUMPED HIM
TODE HAD GOT THE DIALS POINTING TO THE FIFTH DIMENSION ETERNITY HE CALLED IT THOUGH ACTUALLY I BELIEVE IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN ANNIHILATION A GRAND SMASH WELL HE PRESSED THAT LEVER BUT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG
THE WHEELS WERE REVOLVING A STREAM OF VIOLET LIGHT LEAPING OUT OF THE CENTRAL TUNNEL CAST A LURID ILLUMINATION UPON THE SCENE BUT IT WAS TOO LATE A SCORE OF DRILGOES WITH LEVELED SPEARS WERE RUSHING ON THE FOUR HOLD TIGHT SCREECHED PARRISH
THEIR OUTSTRETCHED ARMS INTERLACED AND THERE UPON THE PLATFORM WAS THE ATOM SMASHER A LITTLE THREAD OF VIOLET LIGHT SEEPING OUT OF THE CENTRAL TUBE BESIDE IT STOOD A GROUP OF FIGURES IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH IN THE DARKNESS
WITH AN EFFORT SHE COMPOSED HERSELF YOU MUSTN'T TALK SHE SAID BUT WHAT PLACE IS THIS IT'S ANDY LUMM'S HOUSE NOW REST AND I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING LATER BUT THE FIRST EXPLANATION CAME FROM ANDY LUMM
BUT BEHIND HIM HE HEARD ANOTHER SOUND AND SHUDDERED AT IT ALL HIS HOPES SUDDENLY REVERSED FOR THAT SOUND WAS THE SHOUTING OF THE DRILGOES AS THEY RUSHED FORWARD TO CONQUEST
HE HEARD A WHIR OVERHEAD AND SAW THE ARMS OF THE STONE GODS BEGIN THEIR HORRIBLE REVOLUTION THE PRIESTS HAD STARTED THE MACHINERY AND HIGH ABOVE THE DIN BELOW RANG OUT THE WILD CHANT OF THE HIGH PRIEST
NEVER HAS SUCH A SHADOW PLAY BEEN SEEN PERHAPS AS THAT BELOW WHERE DEATH STALKED IN DENSE DARKNESS AND THE SLAYER DID NOT EVEN SEE HIS VICTIM ONLY THE THRUST OF SPEARS THE SOFT YIELDING FLESH THAT THEY ENCOUNTERED
ONLY THE OCEAN WAS TO BE SEEN PLACID BENEATH THE STARS THE ATOM SMASHER WAS VIBRATING AT TREMENDOUS SPEED JIM WITH ONE ARM ROUND LUCILLE FACED TODE AT THE INSTRUMENT BOARD NEAR BY SAT PARRISH WATCHING HIM TOO
IT WAS SEALED UP IN WAX AND TODE HAD GOT IT FREE ON THE WAY OUT OF ATLANTIS WELL THIS IT WHAT I MADE OUT FROM EXAMINING THE THING AFTERWARD CAIN HAD BEEN MONKEYING WITH THE LEVER HE'D PRIED LOOSE ONE OF THE WIRES THAT HOOKED TO THE TRANSFORMER
WITH LUCILLE BESIDE HIM OLD PARRISH FOLLOWING STILL MAKING A FUTILE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WHILE PITIFUL SCREECHES ISSUED FROM HIS MOUTH JIM SAW THE REVOLVING ARMS DESCEND WITHIN A FOOT OF HIS HEAD ONE MORE FIGHT ONE MORE
IT WAS THE DEATH KEENING OF PROUD ATLANTIS QUEEN OF THE ATLANTIC FOR FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS SHE WAS DYING IN DARKNESS FOR WITH THE BLINDING OF THE EYE ALL THE SOFT LIGHTS WITHIN THE CITY HAD GONE OUT DENSE
GO TO YOUR OWN HELL YOU DEV A BLINDING LIGHT A FRANTIC OSCILLATION OF THE ATOM SMASHER A SENSE OF DEATH AWFUL AND INDESCRIBABLE AND STARK UNCONSCIOUSNESS RUSHED OVER JIM
AND JIM UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT SCENE PORTENDED IN DESPAIR AT THE IRRUPTION OF THE DRILGOES THE PRIESTS WERE SEEKING TO PROPITIATE THEIR GODS BY SACRIFICING THE THREE STRANGERS WHOM THEY HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THEIR WOES
WHIRLING THE CLUB AROUND HIS HEAD HE FOUGHT BACK THE FANATICS ALL THE WHILE SHOUTING TO TODE TO START THE ATOM SMASHER IN SUCH A MOMENT HE ONLY REMEMBERED THAT TODE WAS A WHITE MAN AND OF HIS OWN GENERATION HE STRUCK DOWN THREE OF THE PRIESTS
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER SAID JIM NOW WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT I HAVE ALREADY SET THE DIAL TO ETERNITY DENT GRINNED TODE ETERNITY IN THE FIFTH DIMENSION
DOWN THROUGH A SMALL SQUARE OPENING OVERHEAD NO LARGER THAN A VENTILATOR IT CAME A GLIMMER OF VIOLET FLAME AND JIM HURLED HIMSELF LIKE A MADMAN AGAINST THE STAIRS AND SURMOUNTED THEM WITH TWO BOUNDS THERE WERE NO MORE
SUPPOSE YOU TAKE US BACK TO PECONIC BAY WE'LL DUMP THE ATOM SMASHER INTO THE POND AND TRY TO FORGET THAT WE'VE HAD ANYTHING EXCEPT A BAD NIGHTMARE DON'T TRUST HIM JIM WHISPERED LUCILLE
JIM THOUGHT HE REMEMBERED WHERE HE WAS BEYOND THAT NEXT HALL THERE SHOULD BE THE TONGUE OF FLOORING CROSSING THE AMPHITHEATRE AND JOINING THE PLATFORM OF THE IDOLS BUT HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS HE EMERGED NOT UPON THE TONGUE BUT UPON STILL ANOTHER STAIRWAY
BUT FEELING THE DRAG OF HIS WINGS HE UNBUCKLED THE STRAP AND FLUNG THEM AWAY HE MIGHT NEED THEM BUT HIS ONE THOUGHT WAS TO GET TO LUCILLE IF SHE WERE STILL ALIVE AND HE FELT THAT EACH MOMENT LOST MIGHT MEAN THAT HE WOULD BE TOO LATE
GRANPOP DAWES SAYS THAR'S UNDERGROUND SPRINGS AROUND THE EDGE AND THAT IT RUNS STRAIGHT DOWN TO HELL THOUGH THAT SEEMS SORTER FAR FETCHED TO ME YESSIR AND IF I HADN'T HEARD W N Y C GIVING MISS PARRISH ON THE LIST OF MISSING PERSONS AND AS HAVING BEEN SEEN NEAR HERE
THAT'S A LIE LUCIUS ANSWERED LUCILLE STEADILY AND YOU CAN DO YOUR WORST THERE'S ONE FACTOR YOU HAVEN'T RECKONED IN YOUR CALCULATIONS AND THAT'S CALLED GOD THE DARK BLUR ON THE SPECTRAL LINES OLD PARRISH MUTTERED
SUDDENLY JIM FOUND HIMSELF WEDGED BY THE PRESSURE OF THE CROWD INTO A SORT OF RECESS LEADING OFF THE ELEVATOR COURT SO STRONG WAS THE PRESSURE HERE THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO MOVE AN INCH WEDGED BOLT UPRIGHT HE COULD ONLY WAIT AND LET THE FRENZIED MOB STREAM PAST HIM
THEN HE WAS SEIZED AROUND THE KNEES FROM BEHIND AND FELL HEAVILY THE CLUB WAS WRENCHED FROM HIS HAND IN ANOTHER MOMENT JIM FOUND HIMSELF HELPLESS IN THE GRASP OF THE ATLANTEANS
AND HIS CLOTHES BURNED TO CINDERS IT SURE SEEMS STRANGE TO ME TO THINK MISTER PARRISH GOT AWAY SAFE AFTER THAT EXPLOSION FIVE YEARS AGO AND OF HIS WANDERING AROUND WITH LOSS OF MEMORY TILL YOU FOUND HIM AND BRUNG HIM BACK HERE TO RESTORE IT BUT THAR'S STRANGE THINGS IN THE WORLD
BUT IN THAT INSTANT JIM HAD FOUGHT FREE AGAIN HE CAUGHT LUCILLE AND DRAGGED HER BACK TOWARD THE ATOM SMASHER TODE HAD ALREADY BROKEN FROM HIS CAPTORS AND WAS WORKING AT IT FRANTICALLY HOLD ON SCREECHED OLD PARRISH HOLD ON
DIDN'T KNOW I'D WORKED THAT OUT DID YOU A PLEASANT LITTLE SURPRISE NO DON'T TRY TO MOVE MY HAND IS ON THE LEVER I HAVE ONLY TO PRESS IT AND WE'RE THERE JIM STOOD STOCK STILL IN HORROR
HOW ABOUT PICKING UP A LITTLE TREASURE FROM THE HOARDS OF SOLOMON OR GENGHIS KHAN A FEW POUNDS OF PRECIOUS STONES WOULD MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE IN OUR SOCIAL STATUS WHEN WE REACH LONG ISLAND JIM FELT A COLD FURY PERMEATING HIM
HIS LAST THOUGHT WAS THAT LUCILLE'S ARMS WERE ABOUT HIM AND THAT HE WAS HOLDING HER NOTHING MATTERED THEREFORE EVEN THOUGH THEY TWO WERE PLUNGED INTO THAT AWFUL NOTHINGNESS OF THE FIFTH DIMENSION WHERE NEITHER SPACE NOR TIME RECOGNIZABLY EXISTS LOVE COULD EXIST THERE
UNTIL HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A GREAT SHADOWY SPACE THAT HE RECOGNIZED AS THE CENTRAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CITY MORE BY INSTINCT THAN DESIGN HE HIT UPON THE NARROW COURT THAT WAS THE ELEVATOR BUT THE COURT WAS FILLED WITH ANOTHER MOB OF STRUGGLING PEOPLE
AND NOW IT SEEMED A MONSTROUS THING THAT PROUD ATLANTIS SHOULD BE AT THE MERCY OF THESE HORDES HE HAD LET LOOSE DESTRUCTION UPON THE WORLD BUT IT WAS TO SAVE LUCILLE THAT WAS HIS CONSOLATION
HE THRUST HIS ARM INTO HIS BREAST AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE LEVER JIM RECOGNIZED IT AND REMEMBERED IT WAS THE INSTRUMENT OF UNIVERSAL DEATH
HE'D SAID THEY WOULDN'T WORK BUT HE'D LIED THEY DID WORK THEY BROUGHT US BACK TO THE VANISHING PLACE WE CARRIED YOU OUT AND THEN I SAW YOUR EYELID TWITCH WE WORKED OVER YOU WITH ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION TILL IT LOOKED AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR YOU
DOWN THEY CRASHED CARRYING THEIR FREIGHT OF BLACK CLINGING HUMAN ANTS WHILE FROM THE SEA'S DEPTHS A WAVE A MILE HIGH ROSE AND BATTERED THE FRAGMENTS TO DESTRUCTION FROM THE CRATER OF THE VOLCANO A HUGE WAVE OF FIRE FANNED FORWARD
TODE'S VOICE RANG TRUE HE BELIEVED TODE HAD THE POWER HE CLAIMED YES THE FIFTH DIMENSION AND ETERNITY SAID TODE WHERE TIME AND SPACE REEL INTO FUNCTIONLESSNESS DON'T ASK ME WHAT IT'S LIKE THERE
A MOMENT'S LEEWAY AND NO MORE BEFORE THE SAVAGE BAND WOULD IMPALE THE FOUR UPON THEIR STONE POINTED SPEARS THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR IDENTITY KNOWN FOR GOD'S SAKE HURRY JIM YELLED IN TODE'S EAR
AND WHERE FIRE AND WATER MET A CLOUD OF STEAM ROSE UP A BOILING CHAOS IN WHICH WATER AND EARTH AND FIRE WERE BLENDED SPREAD OVER LAND AND SEA AND THEN SUDDENLY IT WAS ENDED WHERE THE LAST ISLAND OF THE ATLANTEAN CONTINENT HAD BEEN
A VERY INFERNO OF SOUND ABOVE THAT SHADOWY STAIRWAY STILL EXTENDING ALMOST TO THE HEAVENS STEP AFTER STEP FLIGHT BEYOND FLIGHT JIM'S LUNGS WERE BURSTING AND HIS HEART HAMMERING AS IF IT WOULD BREAK HIS CHEST
WHICH LED HIM BACK INTO THE CENTRAL PLACE OF ASSEMBLY IT WAS LIKE A NIGHTMARE THAT BLIND SEARCH UNDER THE PALE THREE QUARTER MOON AND THE BLACK STAR BLOTCHED SKY
AND IN THE FOREGROUND LUCILLE'S FACE THE GIRL WAS BENDING OVER JIM ONE HAND SOOTHING HIS FOREHEAD WHERE AM I JIM MUTTERED BACK ON EARTH JIM THE GOOD OLD EARTH NEVER AGAIN TO LEAVE IT ANSWERED LUCILLE WITH A CATCH IN HER VOICE
HER WALLS AND TOWERS CRUMBLING AND TOPPLING AS A CHILD'S SAND CASTLE CRUMBLES UNDER THE ATTACK OF THE LAPPING WAVES
YES SIR THAR SURELY IS IN THE HAPPINESS OF BEING BACK ON EARTH ONCE MORE JIM WAS CONTENT TO LET FURTHER EXPLANATIONS GO THE RETURN OF PARRISH HAD BEEN DULY CHRONICLED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND HAD PROVOKED A MILD INTEREST
THE AMPHITHEATRE MELTED AWAY WALLS AND ROOF OVERHEAD WERE THE MOON AND STARS AND PROUD ATLANTIS WAS SINKING INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA NOT AS A SHIP SINKS BUT PIECEMEAL
BUT OVER HIM HE COULD FAINTLY SEE THE STAIRS AND THE BALUSTRADE WINDING AWAY TO WHAT SEEMED IMMEASURABLE HEIGHT THAT STAIRWAY MUST LEAD TO THE TOP OF THE BUILDING AND THENCE THERE SHOULD BE SOME ACCESS TO THE AMPHITHEATRE JIM TURNED TOWARD IT
THEN I SHUT OFF THE POWER AND LET THE WATERS RUSH IN OVER THE ATOM SMASHER AND SWAM ASHORE AND THERE IT LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL AND MAY IT LIE THERE TILL THE JUDGMENT DAY TODE WAS A GENIUS SAID JIM BUT HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT CHARACTER COUNTS FOR MORE THAN GENIUS
I MUST HAVE LUCILLE CHOOSE HIS VOICE RANG OUT IN MANIAC TONES CHOOSE ALL OF YOU LUCILLE HAS ANSWERED YOU JIM RETORTED
HE HAD EMERGED UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AMPHITHEATRE UPON THE PLATFORM WHERE HE HAD SEEN THE PRIESTS AND DIGNITARIES GATHERED WHEN HE WAS LED FORWARD TO BE SACRIFICED THERE IN THE REAR WERE THE HIDEOUS SHADOWY GODS LOOMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS
THEN THE ARMS CAUGHT PRIEST AND DRILGO AND THE STEEL HOOKS DUG DEEP INTO THEIR FLESH A SCREECH OF TERROR A HOWL THAT REVERBERATED THROUGH THE AMPHITHEATRE AND NOTHING REMAINED OF EITHER BUT A HEAP OF MACERATED FLESH
HE HAD GONE ASTRAY AND OUT OF HIS BURSTING LUNGS A CRY OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WENT UP FOR A MOMENT HE STOOD STILL WHAT USE TO PROCEED FURTHER AND THEN AMAZINGLY THERE CAME WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SIGN FROM HEAVEN
SOLID EARTH HE'S COMING AROUND LUCILLE THANK GOD FOR IT JIM OPENED HIS EYES FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THEN THE OUTLINES OF A ROOM ETCHED THEMSELVES AGAINST THE CLOUDED BACKGROUND
THE LAST SUDDENLY WITH LOUD YELLS A BAND OF DRILGOES LEAPED FORWARD FROM THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS AND RUSHED UPON THE STRUGGLING PRIESTS AND VICTIMS AND DARK AS IT WAS JIM RECOGNIZED THEIR LEADER CAIN
AND FELL HEAVILY DOWN A FLIGHT OF STONE STAIRS BRINGING UP AGAINST A STONE BALUSTRADE HE GOT UP UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS BRUISES RAN TO THE TOP OF THE FLIGHT AND SAW THE DIM SQUARE OF PALEST TWILIGHT WHERE THE DOOR HAD BEEN
AND SHORT CIRCUITED IT NOT KNOWING OF COURSE JUST WHAT HE WAS DOING THE RESULT WAS THAT WHEN TODE PRESSED THAT LEVER INSTEAD OF BLOWING THE WHOLE CONTRAPTION TO PIECES HE GOT A COUPLE OF BILLION VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIS BODY COMBINED WITH A LARGER AMPERAGE THAN HAS EVER BEEN IMAGINED
OLD PARRISH SNAPPED HIS FINGERS BUT YOU MUST HAVE GOT INTO THE FIELD OF MAGNETIC FORCE ANY WAY YOU WERE ALMOST ELECTROCUTED LUCILLE AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD FOR HOURS WE LAID YOU DOWN AND SET A COURSE FOR HOME I USED THOSE DIAL NUMBERINGS TODE HAD GIVEN ME
INSTEAD JIM FOUND HIMSELF LOOKING DOWN INTO THE AMPHITHEATRE THE THICK WALLS HAD CUT OFF ALL SOUND FROM HIS EARS SAVE A CONFUSED MURMUR BUT NOW A HIDEOUS UPROAR ASSAILED THEM THE WHOLE FLOOR OF THE AMPHITHEATRE WAS A MASS OF MOVING SHADOWS
AND TO MORROW A NEW LIFE BEGINS FOR YOU AND ME
AND CAIN KNEW LUCILLE AS THE PRIESTS RALLIED FOR A DESPERATE RESISTANCE CAIN HURLED HIS GREAT BODY THROUGH THE AIR LANDING SQUARELY UPON THE SHOULDERS OF THE PRIEST NEAREST THE REVOLVING ARMS AND KNOCKING HIM FLAT
AND IN THE DARKNESS THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF DISCOVERING THE SECRET OF RAISING IT HE BLUNDERED ABOUT RAGING FORCING A PATH NOW HERE NOW THERE HE RAN INTO BLIND ALLEYS INTO SMALL THREADING STREETS ABOUT THE COURT
THE SCREAM THE WRENCH OF STONE FROM TISSUE AND THE BLENDED HOWL OF TRIUMPH AND SCREAM OF DESPAIR YET ONLY FOR A MOMENT DID JIM TURN HIS EYES UPON THAT SIGHT FOR HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS NOW
OF SLAYERS AND SLAIN THE DRILGOES HAD BROKEN IN AND TRAPPED THE MULTITUDES THAT HAD TAKEN REFUGE THERE THEIR FEARFUL STONE TIPPED SPEARS THRUST IN AND OUT TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THEIR SAVAGE HOWLS AND THE SCREAMS OF THE DYING
STRUCK AT HIM FURIOUSLY JIM LEAPED ASIDE LETTING THE CLUB DESCEND HARMLESSLY UPON THE FLOOR HE SHOT OUT HIS RIGHT WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH BEHIND IT CATCHING THE PRIEST UPON THE JAW AND THE MAN CRUMPLED
THE FIGHT IN THE DARK HE DROPPED DOWN SOFTLY TO THE CAUSEWAY WITHIN THE CITY HE HEARD A SOUND SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE AS IF SOME ANCIENT PROPHECY OF DOOM HAD BEEN FULFILLED A WAILING
THEY HAD A MOMENT'S LEEWAY THE DRILGOES HAD DRIVEN THE PRIESTS BACK INTO THE HOOKS WITH AWFUL SHRIEKS THE FANATICS WERE YIELDING UP THEIR LIVES IN THE PLACE OF THEIR SELECTED VICTIMS BUT MORE DRILGOES WERE POURING UP THE STAIRS
I'LL HAVE TO TRUST YOU BUT I SHALL HAVE MEANS OF EVENING UP IF YOU PLAY CROOKED WHY DON'T YOU ASK MY GIRL HERSELF PIPED OLD PARRISH HE NEEDN'T TROUBLE HE KNOWS THE ANSWER CRIED LUCILLE SCORNFULLY
BUT FORTUNATELY THE PUBLIC MIND WAS SO OCCUPIED AT THE MOMENT WITH THE TRIAL OF A NIGHT CLUB HOSTESS THAT AFTER THE FIRST RUSH OF NEWSPAPER MEN THE THREE WERE LEFT ALONE DAY AFTER DAY IN THE BRILLIANT AUTUMN WEATHER JIM AND LUCILLE WOULD ROAM THE TINTED WOODS
TODE SAW HIS GRIM LOOK AND LAUGHED MALIGNANTLY WELL DENT I'M READY TO BE FRANK WITH YOU HE SAID THE GAME'S STILL IN MY HANDS I WANT LUCILLE I'M WILLING TO TAKE YOU AND PARRISH BACK PROVIDED YOU AGREE SHE SHALL BE MINE
TOGETHER WE'D HAVE MADE OURSELVES MASTERS OF ATLANTIS AND BROUGHT BACK HER PLUNDER TO OUR TWENTIETH CENTURY WORLD YOU REFUSED BECAUSE OF A GIRL A GIRL DENT WHO LOVED ME LONG BEFORE YOU CAME UPON THE SCENE
