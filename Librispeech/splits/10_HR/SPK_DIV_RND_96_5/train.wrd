OR FUNDED MONEY MADE OVER WAS A MATTER IN WHICH HER DISINTERESTED SPIRIT TOOK NO CONCERN SHE KNEW ENOUGH TO FEEL SECURE OF AN HONOURABLE AND SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT AND HER IMAGINATION TOOK A RAPID FLIGHT OVER ITS ATTENDANT FELICITIES
I THOUGHT HOW IT WOULD BE SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WALK FOR ME TODAY SIGHED CATHERINE BUT PERHAPS IT MAY COME TO NOTHING OR IT MAY HOLD UP BEFORE TWELVE PERHAPS IT MAY BUT THEN MY DEAR
DIVIDED BETWEEN REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF ONE GREAT PLEASURE AND THE HOPE OF SOON ENJOYING ANOTHER ALMOST ITS EQUAL IN DEGREE HOWEVER UNLIKE IN KIND SHE COULD NOT THINK THE TILNEYS HAD ACTED QUITE WELL BY HER
BUT FOR PARTICULARS ISABELLA COULD WELL AFFORD TO WAIT THE NEEDFUL WAS COMPRISED IN MISTER MORLAND'S PROMISE HIS HONOUR WAS PLEDGED TO MAKE EVERYTHING EASY AND BY WHAT MEANS THEIR INCOME WAS TO BE FORMED WHETHER LANDED PROPERTY WERE TO BE RESIGNED
WHO IS THAT GIRL WHO LOOKED AT YOU SO HARD AS SHE WENT BY WHO WHERE ON THE RIGHT HAND PAVEMENT SHE MUST BE ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT NOW CATHERINE LOOKED ROUND AND SAW MISS TILNEY LEANING ON HER BROTHER'S ARM
IT IS VERY ODD BUT I SUPPOSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO DIRTY FOR A WALK AND WELL THEY MIGHT FOR I NEVER SAW SO MUCH DIRT IN MY LIFE WALK YOU COULD NO MORE WALK THAN YOU COULD FLY IT HAS NOT BEEN SO DIRTY THE WHOLE WINTER IT IS ANKLE DEEP EVERYWHERE
THERE ARE NOT MANY THAT I KNOW MY OWN MIND ABOUT BY JOVE NO MORE DO I
BE MY ONLY CHOICE THIS CHARMING SENTIMENT RECOMMENDED AS MUCH BY SENSE AS NOVELTY GAVE CATHERINE A MOST PLEASING REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THE HEROINES OF HER ACQUAINTANCE AND SHE THOUGHT HER FRIEND NEVER LOOKED MORE LOVELY THAN IN UTTERING THE GRAND IDEA
PONDERING OVER THESE HEART RENDING TIDINGS CATHERINE WALKED SLOWLY UPSTAIRS AT THE HEAD OF THEM SHE WAS MET BY MISTER ALLEN WHO ON HEARING THE REASON OF THEIR SPEEDY RETURN
AND SO YOU GUESSED IT THE MOMENT YOU HAD MY NOTE SLY CREATURE OH MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU ALONE WHO KNOW MY HEART CAN JUDGE OF MY PRESENT HAPPINESS YOUR BROTHER IS THE MOST CHARMING OF MEN I ONLY WISH I WERE MORE WORTHY OF HIM
DECLARED HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO MEN SO MUCH ALIKE IN HIS LIFE AND WOULD HARDLY GIVE UP THE POINT OF ITS HAVING BEEN TILNEY HIMSELF THEIR DRIVE EVEN WHEN THIS SUBJECT WAS OVER WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY AGREEABLE
FOR YOU KNOW MISS TILNEY MAY STILL CALL MISSUS ALLEN AGREED TO IT JOHN THORPE WAS SOON WITH THEM AND HIS VOICE WAS WITH THEM YET SOONER FOR ON THE STAIRS HE WAS CALLING OUT TO MISS MORLAND TO BE QUICK MAKE HASTE MAKE HASTE AS HE THREW OPEN THE DOOR
I AM COME TO BID YOU GOOD BYE CATHERINE WISHED HIM A GOOD JOURNEY WITHOUT APPEARING TO HEAR HER HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW FIDGETED ABOUT HUMMED A TUNE AND SEEMED WHOLLY SELF OCCUPIED
OF WHICH THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LIFE CAN HARDLY AFFORD A RETURN THE STRENGTH OF HER FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT EXPRESS THE NATURE OF THEM HOWEVER CONTENTED HER FRIEND THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING SUCH A SISTER WAS THEIR FIRST EFFUSION
AND A BRILLIANT EXHIBITION OF HOOP RINGS ON HER FINGER WHEN THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER WERE ASCERTAINED JOHN THORPE WHO HAD ONLY WAITED ITS ARRIVAL TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON PREPARED TO SET OFF WELL MISS MORLAND
AND AWAY SHE WENT IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF ALL HIS GALLANTRY TO DETAIN HER LONGER WITH SUCH NEWS TO COMMUNICATE AND SUCH A VISIT TO PREPARE FOR HER DEPARTURE WAS NOT TO BE DELAYED BY ANYTHING IN HIS NATURE TO URGE AND SHE HURRIED AWAY
MAY WE GO UP EVERY STAIRCASE AND INTO EVERY SUITE OF ROOMS YES YES EVERY HOLE AND CORNER BUT THEN IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE GONE OUT FOR AN HOUR TILL IT IS DRYER AND CALL BY AND BY
HER BROTHER SHE FOUND WAS PREPARING TO SET OFF WITH ALL SPEED TO FULLERTON TO MAKE KNOWN HIS SITUATION AND ASK CONSENT AND HERE WAS A SOURCE OF SOME REAL AGITATION TO THE MIND OF ISABELLA CATHERINE ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HER AS SHE WAS HERSELF PERSUADED THAT
THE ANXIOUS AFFECTION WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING CONTINUALLY WATCHED IN ISABELLA'S EVERY LOOK AND ACTION HAD IN THE COURSE OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY RECEIVED THE DELIGHTFUL CONFESSION OF AN EQUAL LOVE HER HEART AND FAITH WERE ALIKE ENGAGED TO JAMES
SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW HOW COULD I HELP IT JOHN WOULD HAVE ME GO FOR HE VOWED HE WOULD NOT DRIVE HER BECAUSE SHE HAD SUCH THICK ANKLES I DARE SAY SHE WILL NOT BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AGAIN THIS MONTH
SO VERY LITTLE DID THEY APPEAR TO DWELL ON HER MIND AND SO VERY INADEQUATE WAS THE COMFORT SHE OFFERED DO NOT BE SO DULL MY DEAREST CREATURE SHE WHISPERED YOU WILL QUITE BREAK MY HEART IT WAS AMAZINGLY SHOCKING TO BE SURE
I AM SURE THEY WILL CONSENT WAS HER FREQUENT DECLARATION I AM SURE THEY WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH YOU FOR MY OWN PART SAID ISABELLA MY WISHES ARE SO MODERATE THAT THE SMALLEST INCOME IN NATURE WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME
SHE WAS LESS AND LESS DISPOSED EITHER TO BE AGREEABLE HERSELF OR TO FIND HER COMPANION SO AND THEY RETURNED TO PULTENEY STREET WITHOUT HER SPEAKING TWENTY WORDS AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE THE FOOTMAN TOLD HER THAT A GENTLEMAN AND LADY HAD CALLED
THERE GO GO I INSIST ON IT THE TWO FRIENDS WITH HEARTS NOW MORE UNITED THAN EVER WERE INSEPARABLE FOR THE DAY AND IN SCHEMES OF SISTERLY HAPPINESS THE HOURS FLEW ALONG MISSUS THORPE AND HER SON
TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF CURIOSITY
YOU ARE TO THANK YOUR BROTHER AND ME FOR THE SCHEME IT DARTED INTO OUR HEADS AT BREAKFAST TIME I VERILY BELIEVE AT THE SAME INSTANT AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF TWO HOURS AGO IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS DETESTABLE RAIN BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE NIGHTS ARE MOONLIGHT AND WE SHALL DO DELIGHTFULLY
YOU WILL BE SO INFINITELY DEARER TO ME MY CATHERINE THAN EITHER ANNE OR MARIA I FEEL THAT I SHALL BE SO MUCH MORE ATTACHED TO MY DEAR MORLAND'S FAMILY THAN TO MY OWN THIS WAS A PITCH OF FRIENDSHIP BEYOND CATHERINE
HEAVY FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FALLING THICKLY FLAKES AS LARGE AND NEARLY AS HEAVY AS A CROWN PIECE RENDERING THE ATMOSPHERE SO DENSE AND OBSCURE THAT A MAN COULD NOT SEE A YARD BEFORE HIM MISTER CARLYLE HAD DRIVEN HOME IN THE PONY CARRIAGE
OUR TWO DANCES ARE OVER AND BESIDES I AM TIRED AND DO NOT MEAN TO DANCE ANY MORE DO NOT YOU THEN LET US WALK ABOUT AND QUIZ PEOPLE COME ALONG WITH ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE FOUR GREATEST QUIZZERS IN THE ROOM
HAD TOO MUCH GOOD NATURE TO MAKE ANY OPPOSITION AND THE OTHERS RISING UP ISABELLA HAD ONLY TIME TO PRESS HER FRIEND'S HAND AND SAY GOOD BYE MY DEAR LOVE BEFORE THEY HURRIED OFF
VERY AGREEABLE MADAM I AM GLAD OF IT JOHN HAS CHARMING SPIRITS HAS NOT HE DID YOU MEET MISTER TILNEY MY DEAR SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WHERE IS HE
WE HAD BETTER TAKE A CAB MY DEAR WITH THAT THE MAN I WAS TALKING TO SWUNG OPEN THE DOOR OF HIS CAB AND SHE GOT IN SUCH A FAIR YOUNG LADY SHE WAS I TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM
AGAIN I SAW HIM STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE BETTING ROOMS TALKING TO THE SAME GENTLEMAN AND HIS FACE TURNED SAVAGE I BELIEVE WITH FEAR AS MUCH AS ANGER WHEN HE DISCERNED ME HE SEEMED TO HESITATE AND THEN AS IF HE ACTED IN A PASSION
COME ALONG MY DEAREST CATHERINE FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE AND STAND BY ME AND OFF THEY WENT TO REGAIN THEIR FORMER PLACE JOHN THORPE IN THE MEANWHILE HAD WALKED AWAY AND CATHERINE EVER WILLING TO GIVE MISTER TILNEY AN OPPORTUNITY
HE MAY HAVE BROUGHT HALF A DOZEN MORE WITH HIM GASPED THE UNHAPPY RICHARD I SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE DODGED ME ALL THE WAY HERE NONSENSE SIT YOU DOWN AND BE AT REST IT IS ONLY CORNELIA
AND HIS OWN LIGHT HAIR BRISTLING UP WITH HORROR STRUGGLED INTO HIS WET SMOCK FROCK AFTER A FASHION THE TAILS UP ABOUT HIS EARS AND THE SLEEVES HANGING FORCED ON HIS HAT AND HIS FALSE WHISKERS LOOKED ROUND IN A BEWILDERED MANNER
MY TWO YOUNGER SISTERS AND THEIR PARTNERS I HAVE BEEN LAUGHING AT THEM THIS HALF HOUR AGAIN CATHERINE EXCUSED HERSELF AND AT LAST HE WALKED OFF TO QUIZ HIS SISTERS BY HIMSELF THE REST OF THE EVENING SHE FOUND VERY DULL
I DON'T POSSESS A PENNY PIECE HE ADDED DRAWING OUT HIS TROUSERS POCKETS FOR THE INSPECTION OF MISTER CARLYLE THE LAST COPPERS I HAD THREE PENCE I SPENT IN BREAD AND CHEESE AND HALF A PINT OF BEER AT MIDDAY
HER CHEST SORE AND HER VOICE GOING IN SHORT AT HAVING FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE CAUGHT A COLD LIKE ORDINARY MORTALS WHAT'S THE TIME I WONDER SHE EXCLAIMED
IF THORN WERE NOT HALLIJOHN'S MURDERER WHY SHOULD HE BE PERSECUTING ME WHAT WOULD HE CARE ABOUT ME AND WHY SHOULD HIS FACE TURN LIVID AS IT HAS DONE EACH TIME HE HAS SEEN MY EYES UPON HIM
CATHERINE HAD FORTITUDE TOO SHE SUFFERED BUT NO MURMUR PASSED HER LIPS FROM THIS STATE OF HUMILIATION SHE WAS ROUSED AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES
MISS TILNEY HAD A GOOD FIGURE A PRETTY FACE AND A VERY AGREEABLE COUNTENANCE AND HER AIR THOUGH IT HAD NOT ALL THE DECIDED PRETENSION THE RESOLUTE STYLISHNESS OF MISS THORPE'S HAD MORE REAL ELEGANCE
WHETHER HE DID COMMIT THE MURDER OR WHETHER HE DIDN'T HE MUST KNOW THAT I DID NOT BECAUSE HE CAME UPON ME WAITING AS HE WAS TEARING FROM THE COTTAGE DICK'S REASONING WAS NOT BAD ANOTHER THING HE RESUMED
NOW THAT I HAVE GOT OVER MY PASSION FOR AFY I CAN SEE HER FAULTS MISTER CARLYLE SHE'D NO MORE TELL AN UNTRUTH THAN I SHOULD STICK A MOST AWFUL THUNDERING AT THE ROOM DOOR
I KNOW YOU WILL NOT MIND MY GOING AWAY AND I DARE SAY JOHN WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT AND THEN YOU MAY EASILY FIND ME OUT CATHERINE THOUGH A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
MISS TILNEY EXPRESSING A PROPER SENSE OF SUCH GOODNESS MISS MORLAND WITH THE REAL DELICACY OF A GENEROUS MIND MAKING LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION
THAT YOU HAVE NEVER DROPPED UPON HIM PREVIOUSLY INTERRUPTED MISTER CARLYLE NO SIR AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO SHOW MYSELF IN THOSE LATTER PARTS OF THE TOWN FEARING I MIGHT MEET WITH SOME ONE I USED TO KNOW AT HOME
ON MISSUS ALLEN'S BOSOM CATHERINE SAT ERECT IN THE PERFECT USE OF HER SENSES AND WITH CHEEKS ONLY A LITTLE REDDER THAN USUAL MISTER TILNEY AND HIS COMPANION WHO CONTINUED THOUGH SLOWLY TO APPROACH
BUT SHE RESISTED I TELL YOU MISTER MORLAND SHE CRIED I WOULD NOT DO SUCH A THING FOR ALL THE WORLD
I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
AND GRUNTING AND SNIFFLING AND CHOKING MISS CARLYLE WAS ONE OF YOUR STRONG MINDED LADIES WHO NEVER CONDESCENDED TO BE ILL OF COURSE HAD SHE BEEN ATTACKED WITH SCARLET FEVER OR PARALYSIS OR SAINT VITUS DANCE
HE HAD GOT INTO A PRIVATE CARRIAGE AS HE SPOKE AND IT DROVE AWAY I COULD SEE THAT IT HAD A GREAT COAT OF ARMS UPON IT WHEN DO YOU SAY THIS WAS A WEEK AGO
AND IT LIES SO DEEP IN PLACES THAT YOU HAVE TO COME ALONG AT A SNAIL'S PACE BUT I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
AS THEY HAD AGREED TO JOIN THEIR PARTY THIS WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE MISTER TILNEY STILL CONTINUING STANDING BEFORE THEM AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES CONSIDERATION HE ASKED CATHERINE TO DANCE WITH HIM THIS COMPLIMENT DELIGHTFUL AS IT WAS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GIRL AND A MARRIED WOMAN IS SO VAST THAT THE GIRL CAN NO MORE COMPREHEND IT THAN THE MARRIED WOMAN CAN GO BACK TO GIRLHOOD AGAIN
I DREW HIM ASIDE IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER ON SOLITARY WALKS DURING WHICH I DISCREETLY SOUNDED HIS FEELINGS I MADE HIM TALK AND GOT HIM TO EXPOUND TO ME HIS IDEAS AND PLANS FOR OUR FUTURE MY QUESTIONS BETRAYED SO MANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
LIFE GIVES US BUT ONE FRIEND AND I WISH TO BE YOURS FRIENDSHIP IS THE BOND BETWEEN A PAIR OF KINDRED SOULS UNITED IN THEIR STRENGTH AND YET INDEPENDENT LET US BE FRIENDS AND COMRADES TO BEAR JOINTLY THE BURDEN OF LIFE
AND OBTAINING FOR IT THE MAXIMUM OF PLEASURE WITH THE MINIMUM OF COST I HAVE ALREADY CONVINCED LOUIS OF THE NECESSITY OF GETTING ROADS MADE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY EARN THE REPUTATION OF A MAN INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF HIS DISTRICT
HAVING RENOUNCED ALL IDEA OF FINDING IN MARRIAGE THOSE TRANSPORTS OF LOVE ON WHICH OUR MINDS USED SO OFTEN AND WITH SUCH PERILOUS RAPTURE TO DWELL I FOUND A GENTLE CALM SETTLING OVER ME IF DEBARRED FROM LOVE
MY ONE JOY AND IT IS SUPREME SPRINGS FROM THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING BROUGHT NEW LIFE TO MY HUSBAND BEFORE I HAVE BORNE HIM ANY CHILDREN LOUIS HAS REGAINED HIS YOUTH STRENGTH AND SPIRITS HE IS NOT THE SAME MAN
LA CRAMPADE FEBRUARY MY DEAR LOUISE I WAS BOUND TO WAIT SOME TIME BEFORE WRITING TO YOU BUT NOW I KNOW OR RATHER I HAVE LEARNED MANY THINGS WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FUTURE HAPPINESS I MUST TELL YOU
I FOUND MY ROOM ALMOST EXACTLY AS I LEFT IT
BITTERLY ASHAMED I STRUGGLED WITH MYSELF ALAS WHEN PRIDE IS THE ONLY MOTIVE FOR RESISTANCE EXCUSES FOR CAPITULATION ARE SOON FOUND WE CELEBRATED OUR UNION IN SECRET AND SECRET IT MUST REMAIN BETWEEN US
IN A COUNTRY LIFE SUCH AS OURS WILL BE OUGHT WE NOT TO BEAR IN MIND THE EVANESCENT NATURE OF PASSION IS IT NOT SIMPLE PRUDENCE TO MAKE PROVISION BEFOREHAND AGAINST THE CALAMITIES INCIDENT TO CHANGE OF FEELING
FOR HIS COQUETTISH WHITE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS BLUE ROOF GLITTERING IN THE SUN THE GARDEN AND SURROUNDING WALKS ARE HORRIBLY DUSTY AND THE TREES SEEM BURNT UP
THE FAVOR I AM ABOUT TO ASK FROM YOU WILL DEMAND UNSELFISHNESS ON YOUR PART FAR NOBLER THAN THE SERVITUDE TO WHICH A MAN'S LOVE WHEN SINCERE IS SUPPOSED TO REDUCE HIM THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU RISE TO THE HEIGHT OF FRIENDSHIP SUCH AS I UNDERSTAND IT
RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT THAT AT LEAST IS PLAIN SO SOON AS I REALIZED THAT THE CONVENT WAS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO MARRYING LOUIS I HAD AS GIRLS SAY TO SUBMIT
FOR DEAR I HAVE MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION AFTER THE SNOWS OF SIBERIA A MAN IS READY ENOUGH TO SEE MERIT IN THOSE BLACK EYES WHICH ACCORDING TO YOU USED TO RIPEN FRUIT WITH A LOOK
AH MY LOVE BY THE ARDOR WITH WHICH HE EMBRACED MY PLANS I CAN GAUGE THE DEPTH OF HIS AFFECTION TO CONCLUDE HERE IS A LETTER HE WROTE ME YESTERDAY FROM MARSEILLES WHERE HE HAD GONE TO SPEND A FEW HOURS MY SWEET RENEE
RETAINING PERFECT INDEPENDENCE WHAT COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE MORE HONORABLE A CONTRACT OF THIS KIND DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE LEGAL CONTRACT AND EVEN TO THE SACRAMENT ITSELF COULD BE CONCLUDED ONLY BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
WHOSE WORDS THRILLED ME AND ON WHOSE ARM I LEANT WITH PLEASURE BEYOND WORDS IN SHORT TO BE OPEN WITH YOU AS I WOULD BE WITH GOD BEFORE WHOM CONCEALMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE THE PERFECT LOYALTY WITH WHICH HE HAD KEPT HIS OATH MAY HAVE PIQUED ME
YOU SEE THAT HE FANCIES HIMSELF VANITY OF MEN THE CHOSEN OF MY HEART JUST AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO LEGAL BONDS NEVERTHELESS I HAVE NOT YET GOT BEYOND THAT EXTERNAL ATTRACTION WHICH GIVES US STRENGTH TO PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL
SUCH IS YOUR FRIEND'S SPLENDID TITLE
YOUR FAVORS TO ME HOWEVER SLIGHT WILL ALWAYS MAKE MY HAPPINESS IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE AS NOW FOR I AM SENSIBLE HOW MUCH DIGNITY THERE IS IN OUR PROMISE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S LIBERTY
A FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS LEADS TO THE DOOR WHICH IS PROTECTED BY A PENT HOUSE ROOF
INFUSE WITH PASSION THEN IF YOU WILL THIS FRIENDSHIP AND LET THE VOICE OF LOVE DISTURB ITS CALM ON MY PART I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO BRING MY FEELINGS INTO ACCORD WITH YOURS ONE THING ABOVE ALL I WOULD BEG OF YOU
AND MY CHILDREN IF I HAVE ANY WILL NOT BE RENT FROM ME THEY WILL BE MINE TO TRAIN AND MAKE MEN OF THE JOY OF MY LIFE IF YOU ALSO ARE TRUE TO YOUR DESTINY
WILL HE FIND OUT THERE ARE TWO I AM WRITING NONSENSE NOW AND AS HENCEFORTH I CAN ONLY BE FOOLISH BY PROXY I HAD BETTER STOP ONE KISS THEN ON EACH CHEEK MY LIPS ARE STILL VIRGINAL HE HAS ONLY DARED TO TAKE MY HAND
WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN IN PERFECT TRUST AND MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF GIVING VARIETY TO THE INFINITE THIS IS THE TASK SET BEFORE EVERY TRUE WIFE THE ANSWER BEGINS TO DAWN ON ME AND I SHALL NOT REST TILL I HAVE MADE IT MINE
TO BE THE UNCEASING SPRING OF HAPPINESS FOR A MAN WHO KNOWS IT AND ADDS GRATITUDE TO LOVE AH DEAR ONE THIS IS A CONVICTION WHICH FORTIFIES THE SOUL EVEN MORE THAN THE MOST PASSIONATE LOVE CAN DO
HUMBLE COUNTRY PLEASURES WILL ENLIVEN THE MONOTONY OF MY FUTURE IT SHALL BE MY AMBITION TO ENLARGE THE OASIS ROUND MY HOUSE AND TO GIVE IT THE LORDLY SHADE OF FINE TREES
BY DINT OF CLOSE STUDY I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS LOVE AMOUNTED TO A PASSION ONCE TRANSFORMED INTO AN IDOL WHOSE SLIGHTEST FROWN WOULD TURN HIM WHITE AND TREMBLING I REALIZED THAT I MIGHT VENTURE ANYTHING
ACT OR THINK WITHOUT ADDING TO THE ADMIRATION I FEEL FOR YOUR CHARM BOTH OF BODY AND MIND THERE IS IN YOU A RARE COMBINATION OF THE IDEAL THE PRACTICAL AND THE BEWITCHING WHICH SATISFIES ALIKE JUDGMENT A HUSBAND'S PRIDE DESIRE AND HOPE
SO I ACCEPTED MY PLIGHT AS AN AMUSING EXPERIENCE AFFORDING FULL SCOPE FOR THE CONGENIAL EXERCISE OF COURAGE AND INGENUITY HOW BOUNDLESS ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF KENSINGTON GARDENS THE ROUND POND
I HAVE HAD MY MOMENTS LADY GEORGINA MURMURED WITH HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE
YOU HAVE TO WAIT UPON HER INSTEAD OF HER WAITING UPON YOU SHE GETS SEASICK ON THE CROSSING AND WHEN SHE REACHES FRANCE OR GERMANY SHE HATES THE MEALS AND SHE DETESTS THE HOTEL SERVANTS AND SHE CAN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
I KISSED HER FLUFFY FOREHEAD YOU GOOD GENEROUS LITTLE ELSIE I CRIED I WON'T STOP HERE ONE MOMENT AFTER I HAVE FINISHED THE PAINTING AND PAPERING I CAME HERE TO HELP YOU
THE BUCCANEERING MARINERS OF ELIZABETHAN DEVON I SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR AT THE FOOT OF AN OLD ELM WITH A POETIC HOLLOW PROSAICALLY FILLED BY A UTILITARIAN PLATE OF GALVANISED IRON
AFTER THAT HE CARRIED MY DEAR MOTHER OFF TO BURMA AND WHEN HE AND THE CLIMATE BETWEEN THEM HAD SUCCEEDED IN KILLING HER HE MADE UP FOR HIS APPROPRIATIONS AT THE CHEAPEST RATE BY ALLOWING ME JUST ENOUGH TO SEND ME TO GIRTON
I THOUGHT THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY WHO WAS A SHREWD PERSON IN HER WAY MUST SURELY SEE THROUGH THIS OBVIOUS PATTER BUT I HAD UNDER ESTIMATED THE AVERAGE HUMAN CAPACITY FOR SWALLOWING FLATTERY
A FAINT RED SPOT ROSE QUAINTLY IN THE CENTRE OF THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY'S SALLOW CHEEK MY DEAR SHE MURMURED MY NAME IS THE ONE THING ON EARTH I'M REALLY ASHAMED OF
WITHOUT A FRIEND TO PROTECT A RELATION TO COUNSEL HER I DON'T COUNT AUNT SUSAN WHO LURKED IN LADYLIKE INDIGENCE AT BLACKHEATH AND WHOSE COUNSEL LIKE HER TRACTS WAS GIVEN AWAY TOO PROFUSELY TO EVERYBODY
THE ADVENTURE OF THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY
AND YET AFTER ALL THERE ISN'T MUCH HARM IN YOU I HOPE NOT I SAID DEVOUTLY I WAS BEFORE MY TIME THAT WAS ALL AT PRESENT EVEN A CURATE'S WIFE MAY BLAMELESSLY BICYCLE
WELL YOU'LL DO I THINK SHE SAID CATCHING MY ARM THAT BIG MILL DOWN YONDER HASN'T GROUND THE ORIGINALITY ALTOGETHER OUT OF YOU
SHE WORE COFFEE COLOURED POINT LACE IN HER BONNET WITH A COMPLEXION TO MATCH BUT WHAT COULD I DO MY DEAR I SIMPLY COULDN'T PUT UP WITH SUCH INSOLENCE SO I LOOKED HER STRAIGHT BACK IN THE FACE OH SHE QUAILED I CAN TELL YOU
THE COUNT ANSWERED AND OGLED HER THENCEFORWARD TO DOVER THEY TALKED TOGETHER WITH CEASELESS ANIMATION THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY WAS CAPITAL COMPANY SHE HAD A TANG IN HER TONGUE AND IN THE COURSE OF NINETY MINUTES
DO I LOOK LIKE A WOMAN WHO CARES ABOUT A REFERENCE WHAT ARE CALLED CHARACTERS ARE USUALLY ESSAYS IN HOW NOT TO SAY IT YOU TAKE MY FANCY THAT'S THE POINT AND POOR TOM CAYLEY
I AM TOLD I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY ALARMED AT THE STRAITS IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF A GIRL OF TWENTY ONE ALONE IN THE WORLD
TWO ANCIENT LADIES WERE SEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE ALREADY VERY GRAND LOOKING DAMES WITH THE HAUGHTY AND EXCLUSIVE UGLINESS OF THE ENGLISH ARISTOCRACY IN ITS LATER STAGES
AND ON THE SOUTH BY THE AMPHITHEATRE OF THE ALBERT HALL BUT FOR A CENTRE OF ADVENTURE I CHOOSE THE LONG WALK IT BECKONED ME SOMEWHAT AS THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE BECKONED MY SEAFARING ANCESTORS
I SAID IN MY SUAVEST VOICE BUT I THINK I SEE A WAY OUT OF YOUR DIFFICULTY MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY WOULD GO OFF IN A FIT OF APOPLEXY
BY MONDAY I HAD PAPERED AND FURNISHED THE ROOMS AND WAS READY TO START ON MY VOYAGE OF EXPLORATION I MET THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY AT CHARING CROSS BY APPOINTMENT AND PROCEEDED TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER LUGGAGE AND TICKETS
DO I RECALL HIM CE CHER SIR EVELYN IF I RECALL HIM
THE GIRL HAS SPIRIT SHE REMARKED IN AN ENCOURAGING TONE AS IF SHE WERE DISCUSSING SOME ABSENT PERSON UPON MY WORD AMELIA I RATHER LIKE THE LOOK OF HER WELL MY GOOD WOMAN
IT IS KIND OF YOU TO GIVE ME THIS WARNING BUT I THINK I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I COME YOU SEE OF A MILITARY FAMILY I NODDED MY THANKS AND STROLLED BACK TO ELSIE'S
I HAVE SUPPRESSED THE GEORGINA IT OUGHT TO BE MADE PENAL TO SEND INNOCENT GIRLS INTO THE WORLD SO BURDENED MY OPINION TO A T YOU ARE REALLY AN EXCEPTIONALLY SENSIBLE YOUNG WOMAN THERE'S MY NAME AND ADDRESS
AND I SAID TO HER IN MY ICIEST VOICE YOU KNOW HOW ICY I CAN BE WHEN OCCASION DEMANDS IT' THE SECOND OLD LADY NODDED AN UNGRUDGING ASSENT AS IF PERFECTLY PREPARED TO ADMIT HER FRIEND'S RARE GIFT OF ICINESS
I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO ONE ELSIE PUT IN GRACIOUS HEAVENS NEITHER HAVE I WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU TAKE ME FOR BUT I MEAN TO SEE WHERE FATE WILL LEAD ME I MAY GO WITH YOU ELSIE PLEADED
BECAUSE I SIMPLY DAREN'T UNDERTAKE TO CROSS THE CHANNEL ALONE AND GO ALL THAT LONG JOURNEY
MAY PASS THE REST OF THEIR DAYS TOGETHER I HAD A LOVELY HARANGUE ALL PAT IN MY HEAD IN MUCH THE SAME STRAIN ON THE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES OF ENTERTAINING ANGELS UNAWARES IN CABS ON THE UNDERGROUND
NO MOSQUITOES NO PASSPORTS NO GOODNESS GRACIOUS CHILD DON'T LET THAT ODIOUS MAN BANG ABOUT MY HAT BOX HAVE YOU NO IMMORTAL SOUL PORTER THAT YOU CRUSH OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY AS IF IT WAS BLACKBEETLES NO I WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE THIS LOIS
AS I WALKED OFF WELL PLEASED LADY GEORGINA'S FRIEND RAN AFTER ME QUICKLY YOU MUST TAKE CARE SHE SAID IN A WARNING VOICE YOU'VE CAUGHT A TARTAR SO I SUSPECT I ANSWERED
AND AFTER ROBERT HAD WRAPPED UP MY KNEES IN WET CLOTHS HE TIED UP MY FOOT IN A BRAN POULTICE TO DRAW OUT THE HEAT AND CLEANSE IT BEFORE THE HORSE DOCTOR SAW IT IN THE MORNING AND I MANAGED TO GET MYSELF DOWN ON THE STRAW
BEING WASTED IN MERE BRUTISH SLEEP THERE WAS GEORGE THROWING AWAY IN HIDEOUS SLOTH THE INESTIMABLE GIFT OF TIME HIS VALUABLE LIFE EVERY SECOND OF WHICH HE WOULD HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR HEREAFTER PASSING AWAY FROM HIM
AND SELECTING A STRAW TO CHEW FIXED US WITH HIS EYE HE EVIDENTLY MEANT TO SEE THIS THING OUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE GROCER'S BOY PASSED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET BIGGS'S BOY HAILED HIM
OR GROOMING ME THOROUGHLY HE THOUGHT NO MORE OF THAT THAN IF I HAD BEEN A COW HE LEFT MY BIT RUSTY MY SADDLE DAMP AND MY CRUPPER STIFF ALFRED SMIRK
THE FARRIER ORDERED ALL THE LITTER TO BE TAKEN OUT OF MY BOX DAY BY DAY AND THE FLOOR KEPT VERY CLEAN THEN I WAS TO HAVE BRAN MASHES A LITTLE GREEN FOOD AND NOT SO MUCH CORN
FEEL HOW COLD HIS HANDS ARE THEY RAISED HIM UP BUT THERE WAS NO LIFE AND HIS HAIR WAS SOAKED WITH BLOOD THEY LAID HIM DOWN AGAIN AND CAME AND LOOKED AT ME
THERE WAS THE GLADSTONE AND THE SMALL HAND BAG AND THE TWO HAMPERS AND A LARGE ROLL OF RUGS AND SOME FOUR OR FIVE OVERCOATS AND MACINTOSHES AND A FEW UMBRELLAS
I WILL ATTEND TO THE HOOF AND I WILL DIRECT YOUR MAN HOW TO APPLY THE LINIMENT WHICH I WILL GIVE HIM THE NEXT DAY I HAD MY FEET THOROUGHLY CLEANSED AND STUFFED WITH TOW SOAKED IN SOME STRONG LOTION
THE LONG STRAIGHT ONES I NEVER CAN MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF THOSE THERE IS ONE SIDE FOR TEN A M YESTERDAY AND ONE SIDE FOR TEN A M TO DAY BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET THERE AS EARLY AS TEN YOU KNOW
AND REDUCE IT TO FAHRENHEIT AND EVEN THEN I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT WHO WANTS TO BE FORETOLD THE WEATHER
AND A COUPLE OF POUNDS OF GRAPES IN ANOTHER BAG AND A JAPANESE PAPER UMBRELLA AND A FRYING PAN WHICH BEING TOO LONG TO PACK WE HAD WRAPPED ROUND WITH BROWN PAPER IT DID LOOK A LOT
AND HE TOOK A BOOK OUT OF THE TRUNK WHICH DAB DAB WAS PACKING AND BEGAN TURNING THE PAGES LET US SEE IF BUFFON SAYS ANYTHING
AND ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK AFTER THEY HAD ALL FINISHED EATING THE DOCTOR GOT UP AND SAID MY FRIENDS I AM NOT CLEVER AT SPEAKING LONG WORDS AFTER DINNER LIKE SOME MEN
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THIS HORSE HE GOES VERY FUMBLE FOOTED I AM SOMETIMES AFRAID HE WILL STUMBLE YES SIR SAID ALFRED I HAVE NOTICED THE SAME MYSELF WHEN I HAVE EXERCISED HIM
WE TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT SHAVING THAT MORNING AS WE WEREN'T GOING TO UNPACK THAT BAG AGAIN FOR HIM NOR FOR ANYONE LIKE HIM HE SAID DON'T BE ABSURD HOW CAN I GO INTO THE CITY LIKE THIS
NINE O WHAT I CRIED STARTING UP NINE O'CLOCK SHE REPLIED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE I THOUGHT YOU WAS A OVERSLEEPING YOURSELVES I WOKE HARRIS AND TOLD HIM HE SAID
HE ALWAYS BRUSHED MY MANE AND TAIL WITH WATER AND MY HOOFS WITH OIL BEFORE HE BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR TO MAKE ME LOOK SMART
AND YOUR FORTUNE'S MADE PEOPLE WILL PAY ANY MONEY TO SEE HIM BUT I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY SAID THE DOCTOR YES YOU DO SAID DAB DAB THE DUCK
IT WILL BREAK ALL RIGHT ENOUGH SIR AH
BUT FOR ALL THAT SHE BEGGED ME TO GO AND MEET HIM BUT WHAT MUST WE DO THERE'S THE HORSE TO GET HOME AS WELL AS THE BODY AND THAT WILL BE NO EASY MATTER
HE DID HIS BEST FOR THE MAN THAT PROPHESIES US BAD WEATHER ON THE CONTRARY WE ENTERTAIN ONLY BITTER AND REVENGEFUL THOUGHTS GOING TO CLEAR UP D'YE THINK WE SHOUT CHEERILY AS WE PASS
TO THE ABYSSINIAN GAZELLES AND THE ASIATIC CHAMOIS ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE MY FATHER'S GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS THE LAST OF THE UNICORNS MOST INTERESTING MURMURED THE DOCTOR
IN FACT HE DID A GREAT DEAL OF STROKING AND PATTING
HE SNEAKED THE CIGARETTE THAT I HAD CAREFULLY ROLLED UP FOR MYSELF AND WENT THEN HARRIS AND I HAVING FINISHED UP THE FEW THINGS LEFT ON THE TABLE
NOW THE FACT WAS THAT HE HARDLY EVER DID EXERCISE ME AND WHEN THE MASTER WAS BUSY I OFTEN STOOD FOR DAYS TOGETHER WITHOUT STRETCHING MY LEGS AT ALL AND YET BEING FED JUST AS HIGH AS IF I WERE AT HARD WORK
AND STOOPED DOWN OVER IT IT IS REUBEN HE SAID AND HE DOES NOT STIR THE OTHER MAN FOLLOWED AND BENT OVER HIM HE'S DEAD HE SAID
WITH GREAT PAIN I AM SURE HE WAS SORRY FOR ME FOR HE OFTEN PATTED AND ENCOURAGED ME TALKING TO ME IN A PLEASANT VOICE AT LAST I REACHED MY OWN BOX AND HAD SOME CORN
IS ABOUT THE MOST AGGRAVATING IT FORECASTS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE AND PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO DAY I REMEMBER A HOLIDAY OF MINE BEING COMPLETELY RUINED ONE LATE AUTUMN
THEY ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD GO WITH DOCTOR DOLITTLE AND BE PUT ON SHOW IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN BUT HE SHOOK BOTH HIS HEADS HARD AND SAID CERTAINLY NOT
WITHOUT BREAKING ITSELF IT EVIDENTLY WANTED TO GO ON AND PROGNOSTICATE DROUGHT AND WATER FAMINE AND SUNSTROKE AND SIMOOMS AND SUCH THINGS BUT THE PEG PREVENTED IT
ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A MAN WHO FROM APPEARANCE WAS NOT LESS THAN FORTY IF I LIVE TO SEE NEXT CORN PLANTING TIME I WILL EITHER BE FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW WHICH
AND THEN WITH HIS FORTY SLAVES STARTED FOR THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET AS MANY OF THE SLAVES HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN RICHMOND AND HAD RELATIONS RESIDING THERE THE SLAVE TRADER DETERMINED TO LEAVE THE CITY EARLY IN THE MORNING
YOU IS NOW TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AN NO MORE DUS YOU HEAR DAT YES RESPONDED TOBY
I WILL SEE YOU AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BETTER SAID SMITH AS HIS SERVANT JERRY APPROACHED THE TABLE
AT THIS MOMENT THE ENGINEER OF THE PATRIOT WAS SEEN TO FASTEN DOWN THE SAFETY VALVE SO THAT NO STEAM SHOULD ESCAPE THIS WAS INDEED A DANGEROUS RESORT
AND HE BUILT IT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A NEAT NEW HOUSE THAN ONE OF THE BIG OLD DWELLINGS THAT HAD BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD HELPED THROW THE DAM ACROSS THE STREAM THE DAM WAS THERE STILL
OUR EYES ARE YET ON AFRIC'S SHORES HER THOUSAND WRONGS WE STILL DEPLORE WE SEE THE GRIM SLAVE TRADER THERE WE HEAR HIS FETTERED VICTIM'S PRAYER AND HASTEN TO THE SUFFERER'S AID
HE ATE TOO MANY DRIED APPLES WELL WELL BROWNIE BEAVER MURMURED AND HE STARTED TO ASK MISTER CROW A QUESTION BUT MISTER CROW INTERRUPTED HIM WITH MORE NEWS
WALKER HAD ALREADY ADVERTISED IN THE NEW ORLEANS PAPERS THAT HE WOULD BE THERE AT A STATED TIME WITH A PRIME LOT OF ABLE BODIED SLAVES READY FOR FIELD SERVICE TOGETHER WITH A FEW EXTRA ONES BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE
BY THIS TIME THE BOAT HAD LANDED AND THE COLUMBIA THE OTHER BOAT
GRANDADDY BEAVER HAD PICKED OUT SIX TREES OF EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE EACH PERSON IN THE CONTEST HAD TO TRY TO BRING HIS TREE TO THE GROUND FIRST AND THAT CAUSED SOME TROUBLE TOO BECAUSE SOME CLAIMED THAT THEIR TREES WERE OF HARDER WOOD THAN OTHERS
MISSUS BEAR HAD A BIRTHDAY ON WEDNESDAY AN ENJOYABLE TIME WAS HAD BY ALL EXCEPT THE PIG PIG BROWNIE BEAVER ASKED WHAT PIG THE PIG THEY ATE SAID MISTER CROW
I ONLY WANT ONE FOR MY OWN USE AND WOULD NOT NEED ANOTHER SAID THE MAN IN BLACK AS HE AND THE TRADER LEFT THE ROOM WALKER AND THE PARSON WENT INTO THE SALOON TALKED OVER THE MATTER THE BILL OF SALE WAS MADE OUT THE MONEY PAID OVER
HE LIGHTED RIGHT ON TOP OF BROWNIE BEAVER'S HOUSE AND CALLED PAPER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT BROWNIE HAPPENED TO BE INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND IN A WONDERFULLY SHORT TIME HIS HEAD APPEARED
WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT I BELONGED TO GOVERNOR LUCAS BUT I UNDERSTAND DAT HE IS BIN GAMBLING ALL NIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS ME DIS MORNING SUCH IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF A SLAVE'S POSITION
HE WAS AFRAID THAT IF HE SAID ANOTHER WORD MISTER CROW WOULD GROW ANGRY AND FLY AWAY WITHOUT TELLING HIM ANY MORE NEWS
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS CHANGE HANDS DURING A PASSAGE FROM LOUISVILLE OR SAINT LOUIS TO NEW ORLEANS ON A MISSISSIPPI STEAMER AND MANY MEN AND EVEN LADIES ARE COMPLETELY RUINED GO CALL MY BOY STEWARD
TAKING IN FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS WALKER WHO HAD BEEN ON SHORE TO SEE SOME OF HIS OLD CUSTOMERS RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A TALL THIN FACED MAN DRESSED IN BLACK WITH A WHITE NECKCLOTH WHICH IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE A CLERGYMAN
I CLAIM THE RIGHT OF REDEEMING THAT BOY MISTER JOHNSON MY FATHER GAVE HIM TO ME WHEN I CAME OF AGE AND I PROMISED NOT TO PART WITH HIM MOST CERTAINLY SIR THE BOY SHALL BE YOURS WHENEVER YOU HAND ME OVER A COOL THOUSAND REPLIED JOHNSON
THAT WAS PROBABLY THE LONGEST DAY IN BROWNIE BEAVER'S LIFE AT LEAST IT SEEMED SO TO HIM WHENEVER HE SAW A BIRD SOARING ABOVE THE TREE TOPS HE COULDN'T HELP HOPING IT WAS MISTER CROW
THEIR GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS AT ONCE PRONOUNCED THEM TO BE ABOVE THE AGES SET DOWN IN THE TRADER'S ADVERTISEMENT
CHAPTER TWO GOING TO THE SOUTH MY COUNTRY SHALL THY HONOURED NAME BE AS A BYE WORD THROUGH THE WORLD ROUSE FOR AS IF TO BLAST THY FAME THIS KEEN REPROACH IS AT THEE HURLED
OF COURSE YOUR ENEMY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SWIM AS WELL AS YOU BUT MAYBE HE WOULD THINK TWICE OR EVEN THREE TIMES BEFORE HE WENT PROWLING THROUGH YOUR CROOKED HALL FOR IF YOU HAD ENORMOUS STRONG SHARP TEETH
THAT HE APPEARED PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO THE HEARTRENDING SCENES WHICH DAILY OCCURRED IN HIS PRESENCE IT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE STEAMER'S VOYAGE THAT POMPEY SELECTED FIVE OF THE OLD SLAVES TOOK THEM IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES AND COMMENCED PREPARING THEM FOR THE MARKET
WITH A LUNCH BASKET IN HIS HAND ALL READY TO BEGIN HIS LONG JOURNEY SAY GOOD BY TO HIM THEN SAID MISTER CROW FOR YOU'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN GRANDADDY BEAVER ASKED
BUT NOW YOU IS ONLY THIRTY YEARS OLD DAT IS WHAT MARSER SAYS YOU IS TO BE I KNOW I IS MORE DEN DAT RESPONDED THE MAN I KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT DAT
ALL WENT ON WELL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK THE BOAT ARRIVED AT NEW ORLEANS
THE KILLED AND SCALDED NINETEEN IN NUMBER
WHICH CAUSED GREAT UNEASINESS TO THE LADIES AND TOOK THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT PART OF THE CABIN HOWEVER NOTHING SERIOUS HAD OCCURRED A MAN AT ONE OF THE TABLES WHERE THEY WERE GAMBLING HAD BEEN SEEN ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL A CARD IN HIS SLEEVE
WITH WHICH YOU COULD GNAW RIGHT THROUGH A TREE HE WOULD NOT CARE TO HAVE YOU SEIZE HIM AS HE POKED HIS HEAD AROUND A CORNER IN A DARK PASSAGE OF A STRANGE HOUSE IT WAS IN A HOUSE OF THAT KIND THAT BROWNIE BEAVER LIVED
EVERYBODY THAT DWELT THERE WAS A FINE SWIMMER YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE BROWNIE'S TIME HIS FOREFATHERS HAD COME THERE AND FINDING THAT THERE WERE MANY TREES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE SORT OF BARK THEY LIKED TO EAT
DIS NIGGER IS NO COUNTEFIT HE IS DE GENEWINE ARTEKIL
I WANTED NO ONE TO TAKE NOTICE OF ME SO THAT I COULD OBSERVE THESE FAMOUS CREATURES AT MY EASE AND LISTEN TO THE CLEVER THINGS THEY SAID
THE FATE WHICH AWAITS THEM WHAT CHANCE IS THERE THAT ANY BOOK WILL MAKE ITS WAY AMONG THAT MULTITUDE AND THE SUCCESSFUL BOOKS ARE BUT THE SUCCESSES OF A SEASON HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT PAINS THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN AT
IN WASTING ON TEDIOUS EXERCISES THE BRIEF SPAN OF HIS LIFE IT WAS THE KIND OF PARTY WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER WHY THE HOSTESS HAS TROUBLED TO BID HER GUESTS AND WHY THE GUESTS HAVE TROUBLED TO COME
THE NEW EVANGEL WAS OLD WHEN NINEVEH REARED HER GREATNESS TO THE SKY
CHAPTER TWO WHEN SO MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT CHARLES STRICKLAND IT MAY SEEM UNNECESSARY THAT I SHOULD WRITE MORE A PAINTER'S MONUMENT IS HIS WORK
TURNING TO HIM GAILY SHE ATTEMPTED A SMALL JEST I ASKED HIM TO SHOW HIM THAT I REALLY HAD A HUSBAND I THINK HE WAS BEGINNING TO DOUBT IT
WHEN WE HAD DONE DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF THE LATEST BOOK IT WAS NATURAL TO WONDER HOW MANY COPIES HAD BEEN SOLD WHAT ADVANCE THE AUTHOR HAD RECEIVED AND HOW MUCH HE WAS LIKELY TO MAKE OUT OF IT
THE PENDULUM SWINGS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THE CIRCLE IS EVER TRAVELLED ANEW SOMETIMES A MAN SURVIVES A CONSIDERABLE TIME
I NEVER CEASED TO BE FASCINATED BY THEIR PERSISTENCE IN EATING BUTTERED TOAST WITH THEIR GLOVES ON AND I OBSERVED WITH ADMIRATION THE UNCONCERN WITH WHICH THEY WIPED THEIR FINGERS ON THEIR CHAIR WHEN THEY THOUGHT NO ONE WAS LOOKING
NOT GOOD LOOKING AND YET NOT UGLY FOR HIS FEATURES WERE RATHER GOOD
HE WAS A FAMOUS POET IN HIS DAY AND THE WORLD RECOGNISED HIS GENIUS WITH A UNANIMITY WHICH THE GREATER COMPLEXITY OF MODERN LIFE HAS RENDERED INFREQUENT HE HAD LEARNT HIS CRAFT AT THE SCHOOL OF ALEXANDER POPE AND
HE HAD HIS MOTHER'S CANDID BROW AND FINE REFLECTIVE EYES HE LOOKED CLEAN HEALTHY AND NORMAL I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S VERY CLEVER SHE SAID ONE DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE PHOTOGRAPH BUT I KNOW HE'S GOOD HE HAS A CHARMING CHARACTER
SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE ASPERSIONS OF HER FRIENDS HE'S ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE AND HE'S A TYPICAL BROKER I THINK HE'D BORE YOU TO DEATH DOES HE BORE YOU I ASKED YOU SEE I HAPPEN TO BE HIS WIFE
THE WAR CRY SOUNDS HOLLOW IN THEIR MOUTH THEY ARE LIKE POOR WANTONS ATTEMPTING WITH PENCIL PAINT AND POWDER WITH SHRILL GAIETY TO RECOVER THE ILLUSION OF THEIR SPRING
IT IS NOT WITHOUT MELANCHOLY THAT I WANDER AMONG MY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE WORLD OF LETTERS IN LONDON WHEN FIRST BASHFUL BUT EAGER I WAS INTRODUCED TO IT IT IS LONG SINCE I FREQUENTED IT AND
MISSUS STRICKLAND USED HER ADVANTAGE WITH TACT YOU FELT THAT YOU OBLIGED HER BY ACCEPTING HER SYMPATHY WHEN IN THE ENTHUSIASM OF MY YOUTH I REMARKED ON THIS TO ROSE WATERFORD SHE SAID
THEY TALKED OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND OF GOLF OF THEIR CHILDREN AND THE LATEST PLAY OF THE PICTURES AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF THE WEATHER AND THEIR PLANS FOR THE HOLIDAYS
THE AIR IS NOISY WITH THEIR SHOUTS OF THEIR ELDERS SOME BY IMITATING THE ANTICS OF YOUTH STRIVE TO PERSUADE THEMSELVES THAT THEIR DAY IS NOT YET OVER
WHO FOR THE MOST PART ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THE AUTHOR THAN IN HIS BOOK IN THE PAINTER THAN IN HIS PICTURES AND SHE INVENTED A WORLD OF THE IMAGINATION IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH A FREEDOM SHE NEVER ACQUIRED IN THE WORLD OF EVERY DAY
PERHAPS HER NAIVETE WAS HER GREATEST CHARM YOU KNOW HE'S NOT AT ALL LITERARY SHE SAID HE'S A PERFECT PHILISTINE
MISSUS STRICKLAND ASKED ME FOR MY ADDRESS AND A FEW DAYS LATER I RECEIVED AN INVITATION TO LUNCHEON MY ENGAGEMENTS WERE FEW AND I WAS GLAD TO ACCEPT
THEY EVER SEEMED TO ME QUITE REAL I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT THEIR CONVERSATION BRILLIANT AND I USED TO LISTEN WITH ASTONISHMENT TO
THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE THEY MET WITH INDIFFERENCE AND WOULD PART WITH RELIEF IT WAS OF COURSE A PURELY SOCIAL FUNCTION THE STRICKLANDS OWED DINNERS TO A NUMBER OF PERSONS WHOM THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN AND SO HAD ASKED THEM
THE MEN WERE SOLID THERE WAS ABOUT ALL OF THEM AN AIR OF WELL SATISFIED PROSPERITY EVERYONE TALKED A LITTLE LOUDER THAN NATURAL IN AN INSTINCTIVE DESIRE TO MAKE THE PARTY GO AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF NOISE IN THE ROOM
BUT ALL THIS IS BY THE WAY I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN I WROTE MY FIRST BOOK BY A LUCKY CHANCE IT EXCITED ATTENTION AND VARIOUS PERSONS SOUGHT MY ACQUAINTANCE
MISSUS STRICKLAND HAD THE GIFT OF SYMPATHY IT IS A CHARMING FACULTY BUT ONE OFTEN ABUSED BY THOSE WHO ARE CONSCIOUS OF ITS POSSESSION FOR THERE IS SOMETHING GHOULISH IN THE AVIDITY WITH WHICH THEY WILL POUNCE UPON THE MISFORTUNE OF THEIR FRIENDS
BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION NEVER SETTLED DOWN SO COMFORTABLY AS WHEN IT TURNED TO THE DETAILS OF THE TRADE WHICH WAS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ART WE PRACTISED
AND I SAW HIM NOT INFREQUENTLY DURING THE DIFFICULT YEARS HE SPENT IN PARIS BUT I DO NOT SUPPOSE I SHOULD EVER HAVE SET DOWN MY RECOLLECTIONS IF THE HAZARDS OF THE WAR HAD NOT TAKEN ME TO TAHITI
THEY'RE BOTH OF THEM THE IMAGE OF YOU I SAID YES I THINK THEY ARE MORE LIKE ME THAN THEIR FATHER WHY HAVE YOU NEVER LET ME MEET HIM I ASKED WOULD YOU LIKE TO
SHE SAW THEM DRAMATICALLY AND REALLY SEEMED HERSELF TO LIVE A LARGER LIFE BECAUSE SHE ENTERTAINED THEM
THE SPADE WAS NOT INVARIABLY CALLED A BLOODY SHOVEL WOMAN HAD NOT YET ALTOGETHER COME INTO HER OWN
IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
SERVING AS A SAFE DEPOSITORY OF THE ARTICLES MENTIONED TO DANTES
YOU THINK IT IS ALL FOR AMBITION THEN AND UPON MY WORD THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT SEEM VERY LIKE IT I CANNOT FORGET THAT WHEN SHE FIRST KNEW WHAT MY FATHER WOULD DO FOR THEM SHE SEEMED QUITE DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT MORE
WOULD IT BE TO PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS TO ENABLE HIM TO MARRY SUCH A GIRL SHE MUST BE AN UNPRINCIPLED ONE OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER SO AND HOW STRANGE AN INFATUATION ON FREDERICK'S SIDE A GIRL
THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN
I AM SURE I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO LEAVE YOU SO SOON BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY DREADFUL FOR ME TO BE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY ELEANOR'S WORK WAS SUSPENDED WHILE SHE GAZED WITH INCREASING ASTONISHMENT
YOU WOULD NOT FOR INSTANCE NOW GO TO A BALL FOR THE WORLD YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO LONGER ANY FRIEND TO WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK WITH UNRESERVE ON WHOSE REGARD YOU CAN PLACE DEPENDENCE OR WHOSE COUNSEL
NO I THANK YOU SIGHING AS SHE SPOKE THEY ARE ALL VERY WELL MY LETTER WAS FROM MY BROTHER AT OXFORD NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SPEAKING THROUGH HER TEARS SHE ADDED
CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
FREDERICK WILL NOT BE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS CHOSEN A WIFE WITH LESS SENSE THAN HIS FAMILY EXPECTED I DO NOT ENVY HIS SITUATION EITHER AS A LOVER OR A SON MISS TILNEY
SAID THE ABBE WE HAVE SOME HOURS BEFORE US IT IS NOW JUST A QUARTER PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK INSTINCTIVELY DANTES TURNED ROUND TO OBSERVE BY WHAT WATCH OR CLOCK THE ABBE HAD BEEN ABLE SO ACCURATELY TO SPECIFY THE HOUR
LOOK AT THIS RAY OF LIGHT WHICH ENTERS BY MY WINDOW SAID THE ABBE AND THEN OBSERVE THE LINES TRACED ON THE WALL WELL BY MEANS OF THESE LINES WHICH ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOUBLE MOTION OF THE EARTH AND THE ELLIPSE IT DESCRIBES ROUND THE SUN
UPON THE ENORMOUS DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ABILITY YOU MUST HAVE EMPLOYED TO REACH THE HIGH PERFECTION TO WHICH YOU HAVE ATTAINED WHAT WOULD YOU NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IF YOU HAD BEEN FREE POSSIBLY NOTHING AT ALL THE OVERFLOW OF MY BRAIN WOULD PROBABLY
THE FORMIDABLE HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS AWARE OF IT
I TOLD YOU HOW I MANAGED TO OBTAIN THAT AND I ONLY JUST MAKE IT FROM TIME TO TIME AS I REQUIRE IT ONE THING STILL PUZZLES ME OBSERVED DANTES AND THAT IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO DO ALL THIS BY DAYLIGHT
AND YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT FROM THE COLLISION OF CLOUDS ELECTRICITY IS PRODUCED FROM ELECTRICITY LIGHTNING FROM LIGHTNING ILLUMINATION NO REPLIED DANTES I KNOW NOTHING
WHAT IS MOST TO THE CREDIT OF HUMAN NATURE SUCH FEELINGS OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATED THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEMSELVES
MOST BITTERLY DID SHE CRY IT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUNK BUT WITH HENRY HER FOLLY WHICH NOW SEEMED EVEN CRIMINAL WAS ALL EXPOSED TO HIM AND HE MUST DESPISE HER FOREVER
I FURNISHED MYSELF WITH A LIGHT
WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
LAID ONE OVER THE OTHER LIKE FOLDS OF PAPYRUS THESE ROLLS CONSISTED OF SLIPS OF CLOTH ABOUT FOUR INCHES WIDE AND EIGHTEEN LONG THEY WERE ALL CAREFULLY NUMBERED AND CLOSELY COVERED WITH WRITING SO LEGIBLE THAT DANTES COULD EASILY READ IT
I DO NOT THINK I SHALL EVER WISH FOR A LETTER AGAIN I AM SORRY SAID HENRY CLOSING THE BOOK HE HAD JUST OPENED IF I HAD SUSPECTED THE LETTER OF CONTAINING ANYTHING UNWELCOME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS
IT IS ALL OVER WITH FREDERICK INDEED HE IS A DECEASED MAN DEFUNCT IN UNDERSTANDING PREPARE FOR YOUR SISTER IN LAW ELEANOR AND SUCH A SISTER IN LAW AS YOU MUST DELIGHT IN OPEN CANDID
AS YET BUT ONE OF THEM LET ME HEAR THE OTHER IT WAS THIS THAT WHILE YOU HAD RELATED TO ME ALL THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR PAST LIFE YOU WERE PERFECTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH MINE YOUR LIFE MY YOUNG FRIEND HAS NOT BEEN OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH
NOW LET ME BEHOLD THE CURIOUS PENS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR WORK LOOK
AND EVEN OF THAT IF HARD PRESSED WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN EXTREMITIES BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED IN THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE
I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO PARTICULARS THEY WOULD ONLY PAIN YOU MORE YOU WILL SOON HEAR ENOUGH FROM ANOTHER QUARTER TO KNOW WHERE LIES THE BLAME
MONTE CRISTO FELT TEARS START INTO HIS EYES AND HE AGAIN WALKED HASTILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN SAID MAXIMILIAN IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HIM TELL US WHAT IT IS ALAS CRIED MONTE CRISTO STRIVING TO REPRESS HIS EMOTION
OR IN OTHER WORDS PROJECTED A STREET AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN THE STREET WAS LAID OUT A NAME WAS CHOSEN AND POSTED UP ON AN IRON PLATE BUT BEFORE CONSTRUCTION WAS BEGUN
AND DO YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN MONSIEUR INQUIRED EMMANUEL OH IF YOU DO KNOW HIM CRIED JULIE CAN YOU TELL US WHERE HE IS WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM MAXIMILIAN EMMANUEL IF WE DO BUT DISCOVER HIM HE MUST BELIEVE IN THE GRATITUDE OF THE HEART
NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO I ONLY GUESSED I KNEW A LORD WILMORE WHO WAS CONSTANTLY DOING ACTIONS OF THIS KIND WITHOUT REVEALING HIMSELF HE WAS AN ECCENTRIC BEING AND DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF GRATITUDE
AN ENGLISHMAN SAID MONTE CRISTO WHO GREW UNEASY AT THE ATTENTION WITH WHICH JULIE LOOKED AT HIM AN ENGLISHMAN YOU SAY YES REPLIED MAXIMILIAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO REPRESENTED HIMSELF AS THE CONFIDENTIAL CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH AT ROME
IT IS NEEDLESS TO ADD THAT THERE WERE GOLD AND SILVER FISH IN THE BASIN THE HOUSE WITH KITCHENS AND CELLARS BELOW HAD ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR TWO STORIES AND ATTICS
IF IT BE BUT TO CARRY AWAY WITH ME THE RECOLLECTION OF SUCH SWEET MOMENTS I COULD EVEN THANK YOU FOR CHIDING ME FOR IT LEAVES ME A GLEAM OF HOPE THAT IF YOU DID NOT EXPECT ME AND THAT INDEED WOULD BE WORSE THAN VANITY TO SUPPOSE
OH MONSIEUR THIS IS CRUEL OF YOU SAID JULIE MUCH AFFECTED AND THE YOUNG LADY'S EYES SWAM WITH TEARS MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO GRAVELY AND GAZING EARNESTLY ON THE TWO LIQUID PEARLS THAT TRICKLED DOWN JULIE'S CHEEKS
MADEMOISELLE JULIE SAID HE PENELON HAD STILL PRESERVED THE HABIT OF CALLING HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER MADEMOISELLE JULIE AND HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THE NAME TO MADAME HERBAULT
IN WHICH HE OFFERS TO PURCHASE THE GOOD WILL OF THE HOUSE TO UNITE WITH HIS OWN FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ADVISE ME WHAT I HAD BETTER DO
BUT SUCH AS WE ARE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BITTER SORROWS AND GOD HAS POURED BALM INTO YOUR WOUNDS AS HE DOES INTO THOSE OF ALL WHO ARE IN AFFLICTION SAID MONTE CRISTO INQUIRINGLY YES COUNT RETURNED JULIE WE MAY INDEED SAY HE HAS
CLAD IN A BLOUSE AND CAP A FAINT CRY OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SURPRISE ESCAPED FROM THE LIPS OF VALENTINE WHO ALMOST INSTANTLY SAID IN A SADDENED TONE AS THOUGH SOME ENVIOUS CLOUD DARKENED THE JOY WHICH ILLUMINED HER HEART
BUT AS HE HAD BUT ONE EYE AND THAT EYE HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT DIM IN THE COURSE OF NINE YEARS
WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN INCREASING BECAME ALARMING HE COULD NOT SPEAK
AND THE PURCHASER OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAVING PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR IT AND BEING QUITE UNABLE TO FIND ANY ONE WILLING TO TAKE HIS BARGAIN OFF HIS HANDS WITHOUT A CONSIDERABLE LOSS YET STILL CLINGING TO THE BELIEF THAT AT SOME FUTURE DAY HE SHOULD OBTAIN A SUM FOR IT THAT WOULD REPAY HIM
I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD BE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PURSE WITH THE PAPER AT ONE END AND THE LARGE DIAMOND AT THE OTHER COUNT REPLIED MAXIMILIAN WITH AN AIR OF GRAVITY THOSE ARE OUR MOST PRECIOUS FAMILY TREASURES THE STONE SEEMS VERY BRILLIANT ANSWERED THE COUNT
AND MONSIEUR MAXIMILIAN MORREL WOULD SEE HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO CRIED MORREL THROWING AWAY HIS CIGAR AND HASTENING TO THE CARRIAGE I SHOULD THINK WE WOULD SEE HIM AH A THOUSAND THANKS COUNT FOR NOT HAVING FORGOTTEN YOUR PROMISE
DEAREST VALENTINE SAID THE YOUNG MAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR RESPECTIVE STATIONS MAKES ME FEAR TO OFFEND YOU BY SPEAKING OF MY LOVE BUT YET I CANNOT FIND MYSELF IN YOUR PRESENCE WITHOUT LONGING TO POUR FORTH MY SOUL AND TELL YOU HOW FONDLY I ADORE YOU
ALL OF THE RICHEST AND GLOSSIEST BLACK ILL ACCORDED WITH HIS PLEBEIAN ATTIRE AFTER CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS UNOBSERVED HE ENTERED BY THE SMALL GATE AND
THERE WAS A STUDY FOR EMMANUEL WHO NEVER STUDIED AND A MUSIC ROOM FOR JULIE WHO NEVER PLAYED THE WHOLE OF THE SECOND STORY WAS SET APART FOR MAXIMILIAN IT WAS PRECISELY SIMILAR TO HIS SISTER'S APARTMENTS EXCEPT THAT FOR THE BREAKFAST PARLOR HE HAD A BILLIARD ROOM
NO NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO PALE AS DEATH PRESSING ONE HAND ON HIS HEART TO STILL ITS THROBBINGS WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE POINTED TO A CRYSTAL COVER BENEATH WHICH A SILKEN PURSE LAY ON A BLACK VELVET CUSHION
WHICH WAS FAINTLY DISCERNIBLE THROUGH THE DENSE MASS OF VERDURE THAT PARTIALLY CONCEALED IT THOUGH SITUATED BUT A HUNDRED PACES OFF WHOEVER HAD SELECTED THIS RETIRED PORTION OF THE GROUNDS AS THE BOUNDARY OF A WALK OR AS A PLACE FOR MEDITATION
AS THEY WAVED THEIR VARIEGATED LEAVES IN THE WIND AND CHARMED THE EYE WITH THEIR SCARLET BLOOM HAD FALLEN INTO UTTER DISUSE THE PROPRIETORS OF THE MANSION HAD MANY YEARS BEFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THE POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE ITSELF
I HAVE CHOSEN A TRADE A TRADE OH MAXIMILIAN HOW CAN YOU JEST AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SUCH DEEP CAUSE FOR UNEASINESS HEAVEN KEEP ME FROM JESTING WITH THAT WHICH IS FAR DEARER TO ME THAN LIFE ITSELF
IS IT NOT WORTH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS TO SAVE OUR FATHER'S NAME FROM THE CHANCES OF EVIL FORTUNE AND FAILURE
FOR HE HAS DONE FOR US WHAT HE GRANTS ONLY TO HIS CHOSEN HE SENT US ONE OF HIS ANGELS
BUT THE STRICT DECORUM AND RIGID PROPRIETY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE LEFT NO GROUNDS FOR APPREHENDING THAT ADVANTAGE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HORTICULTURE SEEMED HOWEVER TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED IN THE DESERTED KITCHEN GARDEN
SO I HAVE BECOME A GARDENER AND CONSEQUENTLY ADOPTED THE COSTUME OF MY CALLING WHAT EXCESSIVE NONSENSE YOU TALK MAXIMILIAN NONSENSE PRAY DO NOT CALL WHAT I CONSIDER THE WISEST ACTION OF MY LIFE BY SUCH A NAME
CAREFULLY CLOSING AND SECURING IT AFTER HIM PROCEEDED WITH A HURRIED STEP TOWARDS THE BARRIER AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE EXPECTED THOUGH PROBABLY NOT IN SUCH A COSTUME THE YOUNG WOMAN STARTED IN TERROR AND WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A HASTY RETREAT
MONTE CRISTO NOTICED THE GENERAL ASTONISHMENT AND BEGAN LAUGHING AND JOKING ABOUT IT GENTLEMEN HE SAID YOU WILL ADMIT THAT WHEN ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF FORTUNE THE SUPERFLUITIES OF LIFE ARE ALL THAT CAN BE DESIRED
SHE PROPOSED TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE A WALK IN THE GARDEN BEING ANXIOUS TO SHOW THAT THE DELAY WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS A CAUSE OF VEXATION TO HIM WAS NOT OCCASIONED BY ANY NEGLECT ON HER PART
WELL WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY VALENTINE SO LONG AS I AM SATISFIED AND FEEL THAT EVEN THIS LONG AND PAINFUL SUSPENSE IS AMPLY REPAID BY FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR SOCIETY OR TWO WORDS FROM YOUR LIPS
WHEN TO MORROW WHERE IN MY OFFICE OR IN THE COURT IF YOU LIKE THAT IS THE SUREST PLACE I WILL BE THERE
IT IS MARRIAGE ITSELF MARRIAGE IF SHE DISLIKES THAT SO MUCH WHY DID SHE EVER MARRY HERSELF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME MAXIMILIAN ABOUT A YEAR AGO I TALKED OF RETIRING TO A CONVENT
TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS I DARE SAY IT IS SOMETHING DISPARAGING WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO SAY IT ONLY PROVES HOW LITTLE INDULGENCE WE MAY EXPECT FROM YOUR SEX INTERRUPTED VALENTINE YOU CANNOT AT LEAST DENY THAT YOU ARE VERY HARSH JUDGES OF EACH OTHER
GOOD EVENING VALENTINE SAID A WELL KNOWN VOICE GOOD EVENING MAXIMILIAN I KNOW I HAVE KEPT YOU WAITING BUT YOU SAW THE CAUSE OF MY DELAY YES I RECOGNIZED MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS
IF WE ARE SO IT IS BECAUSE WE GENERALLY JUDGE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXCITEMENT BUT RETURN TO YOUR QUESTION DOES MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS OBJECT TO THIS MARRIAGE WITH M DE MORCERF ON ACCOUNT OF LOVING ANOTHER
AND ALL PRESENT EVEN INCLUDING CAVALCANTI AND HIS SON NOTWITHSTANDING THE STIFFNESS OF THE ONE AND THE CARELESSNESS OF THE OTHER WERE THOUGHTFUL ON FINDING THEMSELVES ASSEMBLED AT THE HOUSE OF THIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE MAN
WELL MONSIEUR FRANZ IS HIS FRIEND YOU KNOW WHAT THEN MONSIEUR DE MORCERF HAS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FRANZ ANNOUNCING HIS IMMEDIATE RETURN VALENTINE TURNED PALE AND LEANED HER HAND AGAINST THE GATE
MUST FIND FAR TOO LITTLE EXCITEMENT IN A COMMON EVERY DAY SORT OF ATTACHMENT SUCH AS OURS BUT THEY ARE CALLING ME DO YOU HEAR AH VALENTINE SAID MAXIMILIAN GIVE ME BUT ONE FINGER THROUGH THIS OPENING IN THE GRATING ONE FINGER
HE WAS INTENTLY WATCHING FOR A SHADOW TO APPEAR AMONG THE TREES AND AWAITING WITH ANXIETY THE SOUND OF A LIGHT STEP ON THE GRAVEL WALK AT LENGTH THE LONG DESIRED SOUND WAS HEARD AND INSTEAD OF ONE FIGURE AS HE HAD EXPECTED
AH MAXIMILIAN I HAD HOPED YOU SET A HIGHER VALUE ON THE TITLE OF FRIEND YOUR LOGIC IS MOST POWERFUL VALENTINE BUT SAY WHAT YOU WILL I CAN NEVER RENOUNCE THE SENTIMENT WHICH HAS INSTINCTIVELY TAKEN POSSESSION OF MY MIND
AH VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IF HE TREATED ME DIPLOMATICALLY THAT IS TO SAY LIKE A MAN WHO WISHES BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER TO OBTAIN A FOOTING IN THE HOUSE SO THAT HE MAY ULTIMATELY GAIN THE POWER OF DICTATING TO ITS OCCUPANTS
BUT COULD YOU NOT COMPROMISE MATTERS AND GIVE UP A PORTION OF YOUR FORTUNE TO HER SON HOW COULD I MAKE SUCH A PROPOSITION ESPECIALLY TO A WOMAN WHO ALWAYS PROFESSES TO BE SO ENTIRELY DISINTERESTED VALENTINE
I RECOLLECT COMING FOR MY MOTHER TO LOOK AT IT WHEN M DE SAINT MERAN ADVERTISED IT FOR SALE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO
I WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP AS YOU MAY IMAGINE BUT I OWN I WENT AWAY WITH RATHER A HEAVY HEART FOR THE HORSE HAD LOOKED AT ME AFFECTIONATELY HAD RUBBED HIS HEAD AGAINST ME AND WHEN I MOUNTED HIM HAD PRANCED IN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL WAY IMAGINABLE
I SEE THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU PAIN I CAN ONLY SAY HOW SINCERELY I ASK PARDON FOR HAVING GRIEFED YOU BUT INDEED I AM NOT PREJUDICED BEYOND THE POWER OF CONVICTION TELL ME WHAT THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO HAS DONE FOR YOU
YES IT WAS HE WHO SAVED THE LIFE OF YOUR STEP MOTHER AND HER SON THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE SAME
BUT I FEAR YOU WILL DEEM IT EVEN MORE ABSURD THAN THE FIRST SO MUCH THE WORSE SAID VALENTINE SMILING IT IS NEVERTHELESS CONCLUSIVE TO MY MIND MY TEN YEARS OF SERVICE HAVE ALSO CONFIRMED MY IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT OF SUDDEN INSPIRATIONS
NOW M DANGLARS ASK THESE GENTLEMEN WHERE THEY ARE CAUGHT STERLETS SAID CHATEAU RENAUD ARE ONLY FOUND IN THE VOLGA AND SAID CAVALCANTI I KNOW THAT LAKE FUSARO ALONE SUPPLIES LAMPREYS OF THAT SIZE
IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DESPISE ME SO WITHOUT ANY REASON AH FORGIVE ME SAID VALENTINE PERCEIVING THE EFFECT WHICH HER WORDS WERE PRODUCING ON MAXIMILIAN
IS BURNING WITH THE DESIRE OF SEEING THIS EXTRAORDINARY NABOB IN HIS OWN HOUSE THEREFORE SHE HAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PREVAILED ON MY FATHER TO ACCOMPANY HER NO NO IT IS AS I HAVE SAID MAXIMILIAN
THE DRAWING ROOMS WERE DECORATED WITH THE RAREST PICTURES BY THE OLD MASTERS THE BOUDOIRS HUNG WITH DRAPERIES FROM CHINA OF FANCIFUL COLORS FANTASTIC DESIGN AND WONDERFUL TEXTURE AT LENGTH THEY ARRIVED AT THE FAMOUS ROOM
I NEVER PLAY FOR I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO AFFORD TO LOSE OR SUFFICIENTLY POOR TO DESIRE TO GAIN BUT I WAS AT MY OWN HOUSE YOU UNDERSTAND SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO SEND FOR THE CARDS WHICH I DID JUST AS THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TO TABLE
EXACTLY ONE COMES FROM THE VOLGA AND THE OTHER FROM LAKE FUSARO IMPOSSIBLE CRIED ALL THE GUESTS SIMULTANEOUSLY WELL THIS IS JUST WHAT AMUSES ME SAID MONTE CRISTO I AM LIKE NERO CUPITOR IMPOSSIBILIUM
NOT BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO DO THAT SAID VALENTINE WITH A SAD SMILE IF SHE OBJECTS TO YOUR MARRYING M D'EPINAY SHE WOULD BE ALL THE MORE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO ANY OTHER PROPOSITION NO MAXIMILIAN IT IS NOT SUITORS TO WHICH MADAME DE VILLEFORT OBJECTS
AND HAVE YOU SUCCEEDED I THINK SO
BUT HOW WILL YOU PASS THROUGH THE BARRIER WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION IT SEEMS TO ME
HE SAID HOW HAPPY YOU WILL BE I WILL DO MY BEST SAID THE INN KEEPER OF THE PONT DU GARD SHUTTING UP HIS KNIFE WELL THEN WE WILL GO INTO PARIS
YOU SPEAK TO ME BEFORE MY SERVANT HOW CAN I HELP THAT MY BOY I SPEAK TO YOU WHEN I CAN CATCH YOU YOU HAVE A QUICK HORSE A LIGHT TILBURY
AND NOW THAT YOU HAVE ALL YOU WANT AND THAT WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER JUMP DOWN FROM THE TILBURY AND DISAPPEAR
HE HAD NOTICED THE APPROACH OF VILLEFORT TO MADAME DANGLARS AND HE SOON GUESSED ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THOUGH THE WORDS HAD BEEN UTTERED IN SO LOW A VOICE
ANDREA DROVE PAST THE LAST HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO HIS COMPANION WHO SMILED COMPLACENTLY AS THOUGH WELL PLEASED TO FIND HIMSELF TRAVELLING IN SO COMFORTABLE A VEHICLE
THE TWO FRIENDS AS WE SEE WERE WORTHY OF AND UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER ANDREA'S HAND LEFT HIS POCKET INOFFENSIVELY AND WAS CARRIED UP TO THE RED MUSTACHE WHICH IT PLAYED WITH FOR SOME TIME
COME COME WHAT THEN PATIENCE PATIENCE I AM PATIENT BUT GO ON
SAID THE GROOM ENDEAVORING TO RID HIS MASTER OF THE TROUBLESOME INTRUDER I AM NOT BEGGING MY FINE FELLOW SAID THE UNKNOWN TO THE SERVANT WITH SO IRONICAL AN EXPRESSION OF THE EYE AND SO FRIGHTFUL A SMILE THAT HE WITHDREW
YOU ARE LUCKY I WISH I COULD SAY AS MUCH FOR I DO CONCEAL MYSELF AND THEN I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE ME BUT YOU DID
BUT TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT WHY DO YOU WISH TO KNOW ASKED CAVALCANTI WHAT DO YOU AGAIN DEFY ME NO THE FACT IS I HAVE FOUND MY FATHER WHAT
YOU ARE SPECULATING UPON ME WHAT FINE WORDS HE USES
YOU WOULD NOT LIKE ME TO RISK TAKING COLD BUT WHAT AM I TO DO YOU OH YOU ARE YOUNG WHILE I AM BEGINNING TO GET OLD AU REVOIR BENEDETTO
OR WAS HE MERELY STRUCK WITH THE HORRIBLE APPEARANCE OF HIS INTERROGATOR WE CANNOT SAY BUT ONLY RELATE THE FACT THAT HE SHUDDERED AND STEPPED BACK SUDDENLY
WHERE IT BEGAN PLAYING WITH A PISTOL BUT MEANWHILE
WE SHALL SEE HE THEN TOOK THE GREAT COAT WITH THE LARGE COLLAR WHICH THE GROOM HAD LEFT BEHIND IN THE TILBURY AND PUT IT ON HIS BACK THEN HE TOOK OFF CAVALCANTI'S HAT WHICH HE PLACED UPON HIS OWN HEAD AND FINALLY
OH BE EASY I HAVE NO DESIGN UPON YOUR COUNT AND YOU SHALL HAVE HIM ALL TO YOURSELF BUT
I CAN SCARCELY STAND THE YOUNG MAN SHUDDERED AT THIS STRANGE FAMILIARITY TELL ME HE SAID TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT WELL THEN
TORN AND FILTHY GARMENTS COVERED HIS LARGE BONY LIMBS WHICH SEEMED AS THOUGH LIKE THOSE OF A SKELETON THEY WOULD RATTLE AS HE WALKED AND THE HAND WITH WHICH HE LEANED UPON THE YOUNG MAN'S SHOULDER
AS YOU SAID JUST NOW YOU ARE A NATIVE OF MARSEILLES I AM DO YOU KNOW THEN NOW WHAT YOU ARE NO BUT I WAS BROUGHT UP IN CORSICA YOU ARE OLD AND OBSTINATE
AND HAD RETURNED JUST AS THEY WERE STARTING BUT INSTEAD OF EITHER OF THESE HE SAW NOTHING BUT A STRANGE FACE SUNBURNT AND ENCIRCLED BY A BEARD WITH EYES BRILLIANT AS CARBUNCLES
AT THIS NAME NO DOUBT THE YOUNG MAN REFLECTED A LITTLE FOR HE WENT TOWARDS HIS GROOM SAYING THIS MAN IS RIGHT I DID INDEED CHARGE HIM WITH A COMMISSION THE RESULT OF WHICH HE MUST TELL ME WALK TO THE BARRIER
YES SAID THE MAN THRUSTING HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS AND LOOKING IMPUDENTLY AT THE YOUTH I HAVE TAKEN THE WHIM INTO MY HEAD DO YOU UNDERSTAND MASTER BENEDETTO
A PEER OF FRANCE AH SAID ANDREA WHO KNOWS MAJOR CAVALCANTI IS ALREADY ONE PERHAPS BUT THEN HEREDITARY RANK IS ABOLISHED
AS FOR M DANGLARS ABSORBED IN AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH M CAVALCANTI HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT WAS PASSING
AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HOSPITALITY OF THE COUNT MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WAS IN THE SOCIETY OF SOME NABOB COME TO PARIS TO FINISH THE WORLDLY EDUCATION OF HIS HEIR
THEN AFTER DINNER ON THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS HE QUESTIONED THE FATHER AND SON UPON THEIR MODE OF LIVING AND THE FATHER AND SON PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THROUGH DANGLARS THE ONE WAS TO RECEIVE HIS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME UP IN YOUR FINE CARRIAGE AND CARRY ME BACK ANDREA TURNED PALE BUT SAID NOTHING
COME STEP IN SAID THE YOUNG MAN IT WAS A PITY THIS SCENE HAD NOT OCCURRED IN DAYLIGHT FOR IT WAS CURIOUS TO SEE THIS RASCAL THROWING HIMSELF HEAVILY DOWN ON THE CUSHION BESIDE THE YOUNG AND ELEGANT DRIVER OF THE TILBURY
AND A SMILE UPON THE MOUTH WHICH DISPLAYED A PERFECT SET OF WHITE TEETH POINTED AND SHARP AS THE WOLF'S OR JACKAL'S A RED HANDKERCHIEF ENCIRCLED HIS GRAY HEAD
THEY IMMEDIATELY DESCENDED AND ASSISTED THE ASSEMBLED HOUSEHOLD OF THE BOWER TO DISEMBARK THE CONTENTS OF THE CHARIOT BUT MISTER TEMPLE AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH LADY BELLAIR'S CHARACTER TO APPEAR AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT

WITH AMAZING QUICKNESS THE ANIMAL LUNGED AHEAD PAUSED SUDDENLY THEN SHOT ACROSS THE PLAIN IN A SERIES OF LEAPS AND TWISTS TAD SHOOK OUT THE REIN AT THE SAME TIME GIVING A GENTLE PRESSURE TO THE ROWELS OF HIS SPURS
YOU WOULD CONTRIVE SOMEHOW OR OTHER TO FIND OUT WHAT I WANTED NEVER MIND NEVER MIND COME MY CHARMING FRIEND LET ME TAKE YOUR ARM NOW I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO THE PRETTIEST THE DEAREST THE MOST INNOCENT AND CHARMING LADY IN THE WORLD SHE IS MY GREATEST FAVOURITE
GREGORY RUN GREGORY IT IS THE PAGE THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR HIM BEHIND AND I TOLD HIM TO LIE UNDER THE SEAT POOR DEAR BOY HE MUST BE SMOTHERED I HOPE HE IS NOT DEAD OH THERE HE IS HAS MISS TEMPLE GOT A PAGE
HOWEVER WHEN HE SOUGHT TO UNSEAT HIS RIDER BY BRUSHING AGAINST THE TRUNK OF A LARGE TREE HE AGAIN FELT THE STING OF THE QUIRT ON HIS FLANK GRADUALLY TAD NOW BEGAN TO WORK THE ANIMAL AROUND AFTER A TIME HE SUCCEEDED IN DOING THIS AND WAS SOON HEADED FOR CAMP
YES THEN DRIVE THEM IN WHEN YOU GET WELL SEATED TAD SHOOK HIS HEAD I DO NOT THINK THAT WILL BE NECESSARY GUESS HE'LL GO FAST ENOUGH WITHOUT URGING HIM WITH THE ROWELS ANSWERED THE BOY
VERY INTERESTING OLD RUIN SIR ANSWERED THE HOST BUILT BY THE MEXICANS MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO YES SO I UNDERSTAND IS IT TRUE THAT THERE'S SPOOKS IN THAT PLACE INTERRUPTED STACY EVERYBODY LAUGHED
TAD'S HEAD SWAM HE NO LONGER HEARD THE SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE COWPUNCHERS HE WAS CLINGING DESPERATELY TO HIS INSECURE SEAT WITH LEGS PRESSED TIGHTLY AGAINST THE PONY'S SIDES AS YET HE HAD NOT SEEN FIT TO USE THE ROWELS
CHAPTER TWENTY DINNER AT THE OX BOW WELCOME TO THE OX BOW YOUNG GENTLEMEN GREETED COLONEL MC CLURE THE RANCHER AND HIS WIFE WERE WAITING AT THE LOWER END OF THE LAWN AS THE PONY RIDER BOYS ACCOMPANIED BY PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN
FIRST CAME FORTH A STATELY DAME OF AMPLE PROPORTIONS AND EXCEEDINGLY MAGNIFICENT ATTIRE BEING DRESSED IN THE EXTREME OF GORGEOUS FASHION AND WHO AFTER BEING LANDED ON THE MARBLE STEPS WAS FOR SOME MOMENTS ABSORBED IN THE FLUTTERING ARRANGEMENT OF HER PLUMAGE
SUGGESTED TAD OH YES I WISH HER TO IT WILL DO HER GOOD IT WILL TAKE HER MIND FROM HERSELF TAD BUTLER NOTED THE LAST HALF OF THE SENTENCE PARTICULARLY FOR HIM IT HELD A DEEPER MEANING THAN IT DID FOR HIS COMPANIONS
ONE CAN ONLY LOVE ONCE AND DID YOU EVER SEE HER AGAIN NEVER NEVER I NEVER RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY WHERE SHE LIVED TO MALTA YES MALTA SHE IS THEN NOW AT MALTA I THINK SO
AH BUT YOU ARE JOKING MY WORTHY MAN SAID D'ARTAGNAN IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IF MY BOOTS NEED A SPONGE YOUR STOCKINGS AND SHOES STAND IN EQUAL NEED OF A BRUSH MAY YOU NOT HAVE BEEN PHILANDERING A LITTLE ALSO MONSIEUR BONACIEUX
YOU MUST GIVE YOUR RECIPE TO PLANCHET I MAY BE BESIEGED IN MY TURN AND I SHALL NOT BE SORRY FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO LET ME ENJOY THE SAME ADVANTAGES WITH WHICH YOU GRATIFY YOUR MASTER LORD MONSIEUR THERE IS NOTHING MORE EASY SAID MOUSQUETON WITH A MODEST AIR
THAT'S ALL DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS PRETENDED DUCHESS IS I REPEAT TO YOU I DON'T KNOW HER
PARDON MY DEAR MONSIEUR BONACIEUX IF I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY SAID D'ARTAGNAN BUT NOTHING MAKES ONE SO THIRSTY AS WANT OF SLEEP I AM PARCHED WITH THIRST
WITHOUT ASKING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND ALIGHTED COMMENDED THE HORSES TO THE CARE OF HIS LACKEY
THEN A SUDDEN IDEA CROSSED THE MIND OF D'ARTAGNAN THAT LITTLE STOUT MAN SHORT AND ELDERLY THAT SORT OF LACKEY DRESSED IN DARK CLOTHES TREATED WITHOUT CEREMONY BY THE MEN WEARING SWORDS WHO COMPOSED THE ESCORT
OUR HOST HAS A WELL FURNISHED CELLAR THE KEY OF WHICH NEVER LEAVES HIM ONLY THIS CELLAR HAS A VENTILATING HOLE NOW THROUGH THIS VENTILATING HOLE I THROW MY LASSO AND AS I NOW KNOW IN WHICH PART OF THE CELLAR IS THE BEST WINE THAT'S MY POINT FOR SPORT
AND IN FRANCE ETERNAL FRIENDSHIPS ARE AS RARE AS THE CUSTOM OF DIVIDING BREAD AND SALT WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT SAID THE COUNTESS BREATHLESSLY WITH HER EYES FIXED ON MONTE CRISTO WHOSE ARM SHE CONVULSIVELY PRESSED WITH BOTH HANDS WE ARE FRIENDS ARE WE NOT
MY GOD THAT'S ALL I SHALL BE ABOUT AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS WHY DID YOU NOT HAVE YOURSELF CONVEYED TO PARIS YOU MUST BE CRUELLY BORED HERE THAT WAS MY INTENTION BUT MY DEAR FRIEND I HAVE ONE THING TO CONFESS TO YOU WHAT'S THAT
AND GATHERED A BUNCH OF MUSCATEL GRAPES SEE COUNT SHE SAID WITH A SMILE SO SAD IN ITS EXPRESSION THAT ONE COULD ALMOST DETECT THE TEARS ON HER EYELIDS SEE OUR FRENCH GRAPES ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED I KNOW WITH YOURS OF SICILY AND CYPRUS
I HAD RECOURSE TO A LITTLE OF MY OLD TRADE WHILE WALKING NEAR THE WOOD OF MONSIEUR LE PRINCE I LAID A FEW SNARE IN THE RUNS AND WHILE RECLINING ON THE BANKS OF HIS HIGHNESS'S PIECES OF WATER I SLIPPED A FEW LINES INTO HIS FISH PONDS SO THAT NOW THANKS BE TO GOD
AND WHAT HAS BECAME OF HIM OH I DON'T KNOW HE HAD ENOUGH AND SET OFF WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE REST BUT YOU MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU SO THAT THIS STRAIN OF THE KNEE CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN MY DEAR PORTHOS KEEPS YOU IN BED
WELL CAN I SEE PORTHOS CERTAINLY MONSIEUR TAKE THE STAIRS ON YOUR RIGHT GO UP THE FIRST FLIGHT AND KNOCK AT NUMBER ONE ONLY WARN HIM THAT IT IS YOU WHY SHOULD I DO THAT
MONSIEUR HE CARRIED ON A TRADE WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT SATISFACTORY WHICH
PORTHOS SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FREELY AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU MY DEAR PORTHOS CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN WHY ON MAKING A THRUST AT MY ADVERSARY WHOM I HAD ALREADY HIT THREE TIMES AND WHOM I MEANT TO FINISH WITH THE FOURTH
I MUST ALLOW AS YOU SAY YOUR FATHER WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT FELLOW AND YOU SAY IN HIS LEISURE MOMENTS THE WORTHY MAN WAS A POACHER YES MONSIEUR AND IT WAS HE WHO TAUGHT ME TO LAY A SNARE AND GROUND A LINE THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WHEN I SAW OUR LABORERS
THE GRAPES WERE NO OTHER THAN GOLD COINS WHICH TINKLED MERRILY AS THEY SWAYED IN THE WIND THEY SEEMED TO SAY
THIS LACKEY WAS MY COMPATRIOT AND WE BECAME THE MORE INTIMATE FROM THERE BEING MANY RESEMBLANCES OF CHARACTER BETWEEN US WE LOVED SPORTING OF ALL KINDS BETTER THAN ANYTHING SO THAT HE RELATED TO ME HOW IN THE PLAINS OF THE PAMPAS THE NATIVES HUNT THE TIGER AND THE WILD BULL
AS HE WAS SO IN NEED OF STRENGTH HE HAD TO HAVE FOUR MORE HELPINGS OF BUTTER AND CHEESE THE FOX AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF COAXING TRIED HIS BEST TO EAT A LITTLE THE DOCTOR HAD PUT HIM ON A DIET AND HE HAD TO BE SATISFIED WITH A SMALL HARE
AND THAT SHE WAS SURE IT WAS FOR SOME WOMAN HE HAD RECEIVED THIS WOUND HAS HE BEEN WOUNDED THEN OH GOOD LORD
YOUR LORDSHIP DOES ME MUCH HONOR SAID THE HOST AND I THANK YOU SINCERELY FOR YOUR KIND WISH BUT DON'T MISTAKE SAID D'ARTAGNAN THERE IS MORE SELFISHNESS IN MY TOAST THAN PERHAPS YOU MAY THINK
NO FATHER I HAVE NO ONE HOW CAN YOU EXIST THUS WITHOUT ANY ONE TO ATTACH YOU TO LIFE IT IS NOT MY FAULT MADAME AT MALTA I LOVED A YOUNG GIRL WAS ON THE POINT OF MARRYING HER
BUT MOUSQUETON FORAGES AND BRINGS IN PROVISIONS FRIEND MOUSQUETON YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE A REINFORCEMENT AND WE MUST HAVE AN INCREASE OF SUPPLIES MOUSQUETON SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU MUST RENDER ME A SERVICE WHAT MONSIEUR
BECAUSE SHE FLEW INTO A GREAT PASSION ON RECEIVING THE LETTER
IN FACT IN ADDITION TO THAT YELLOW SICKLY PALENESS WHICH INDICATES THE INSINUATION OF THE BILE IN THE BLOOD AND WHICH MIGHT BESIDES BE ACCIDENTAL
PINOCCHIO PAID A GOLD PIECE FOR THE THREE SUPPERS AND STARTED ON HIS WAY TOWARD THE FIELD THAT WAS TO MAKE HIM A RICH MAN HE WALKED ON NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS GOING FOR IT WAS DARK SO DARK THAT NOT A THING WAS VISIBLE
I PUT MY FOOT ON A STONE SLIPPED AND STRAINED MY KNEE TRULY HONOR
INDEED YES THEY WENT TWO HOURS AGO WHY IN SUCH A HURRY UNFORTUNATELY THE CAT RECEIVED A TELEGRAM WHICH SAID THAT HIS FIRST BORN WAS SUFFERING FROM CHILBLAINS AND WAS ON THE POINT OF DEATH
ROUND ABOUT HIM NOT A LEAF STIRRED A FEW BATS SKIMMED HIS NOSE NOW AND AGAIN AND SCARED HIM HALF TO DEATH
HOWEVER NOT ONE OF THEM WAS VERY HUNGRY THE POOR CAT FELT VERY WEAK AND HE WAS ABLE TO EAT ONLY THIRTY FIVE MULLETS WITH TOMATO SAUCE AND FOUR PORTIONS OF TRIPE WITH CHEESE MOREOVER
WE HAVE NOT ONLY LOST THAT LOVELY DARLING BOY BUT THIS POOR GIRL WHOM I SINCERELY LOVE IS TO BE TORN AWAY BY EVEN A WORSE FATE IF SHE IS CONDEMNED I NEVER SHALL KNOW JOY MORE BUT SHE WILL NOT I AM SURE SHE WILL NOT
I PASSED A NIGHT OF UNMINGLED WRETCHEDNESS IN THE MORNING I WENT TO THE COURT MY LIPS AND THROAT WERE PARCHED I DARED NOT ASK THE FATAL QUESTION BUT I WAS KNOWN
NIGHT ALSO CLOSED AROUND AND WHEN I COULD HARDLY SEE THE DARK MOUNTAINS I FELT STILL MORE GLOOMILY THE PICTURE APPEARED A VAST AND DIM SCENE OF EVIL AND I FORESAW OBSCURELY THAT I WAS DESTINED TO BECOME THE MOST WRETCHED OF HUMAN BEINGS
MY COUSIN REPLIED I IT IS DECIDED AS YOU MAY HAVE EXPECTED ALL JUDGES HAD RATHER THAT TEN INNOCENT SHOULD SUFFER THAN THAT ONE GUILTY SHOULD ESCAPE BUT SHE HAS CONFESSED
HAD MET ME AT MIDNIGHT AMONG THE PRECIPICES OF AN INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN
SIX YEARS HAD ELAPSED PASSED IN A DREAM BUT FOR ONE INDELIBLE TRACE AND I STOOD IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE I HAD LAST EMBRACED MY FATHER BEFORE MY DEPARTURE FOR INGOLSTADT BELOVED AND VENERABLE PARENT
I BORE A HELL WITHIN ME WHICH NOTHING COULD EXTINGUISH WE STAYED SEVERAL HOURS WITH JUSTINE AND IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT ELIZABETH COULD TEAR HERSELF AWAY I WISH CRIED SHE THAT I WERE TO DIE WITH YOU
HAD HE NOT MURDERED MY BROTHER NO ONE CAN CONCEIVE THE ANGUISH I SUFFERED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT WHICH I SPENT COLD AND WET IN THE OPEN AIR BUT I DID NOT FEEL THE INCONVENIENCE OF THE WEATHER
I AM SAID SHE THE COUSIN OF THE UNHAPPY CHILD WHO WAS MURDERED OR RATHER HIS SISTER FOR I WAS EDUCATED BY AND HAVE LIVED WITH HIS PARENTS EVER SINCE AND EVEN LONG BEFORE HIS BIRTH IT MAY THEREFORE BE
THE APPEARANCE OF JUSTINE WAS CALM SHE WAS DRESSED IN MOURNING AND HER COUNTENANCE ALWAYS ENGAGING WAS RENDERED BY THE SOLEMNITY OF HER FEELINGS EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL
THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED AGAINST HER I BELIEVE AND RELY ON HER PERFECT INNOCENCE SHE HAD NO TEMPTATION FOR SUCH AN ACTION AS TO THE BAUBLE ON WHICH THE CHIEF PROOF RESTS
I KNOW THE MURDERER JUSTINE POOR GOOD JUSTINE IS INNOCENT AT THAT INSTANT MY FATHER ENTERED I SAW UNHAPPINESS DEEPLY IMPRESSED ON HIS COUNTENANCE BUT HE ENDEAVOURED TO WELCOME ME CHEERFULLY
I CANNOT LIVE IN THIS WORLD OF MISERY JUSTINE ASSUMED AN AIR OF CHEERFULNESS WHILE SHE WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSED HER BITTER TEARS SHE EMBRACED ELIZABETH AND SAID IN A VOICE OF HALF SUPPRESSED EMOTION
THE ROAD RAN BY THE SIDE OF THE LAKE WHICH BECAME NARROWER AS I APPROACHED MY NATIVE TOWN I DISCOVERED MORE DISTINCTLY THE BLACK SIDES OF JURA AND THE
I CONTEMPLATED THE LAKE THE WATERS WERE PLACID ALL AROUND WAS CALM AND THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS THE PALACES OF NATURE WERE NOT CHANGED BY DEGREES THE CALM AND HEAVENLY SCENE RESTORED ME AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TOWARDS GENEVA
SHE THEN RELATED THAT BY THE PERMISSION OF ELIZABETH SHE HAD PASSED THE EVENING OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AT THE HOUSE OF AN AUNT AT CHENE
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN FOR ANOTHER FLASH DISCOVERED HIM TO ME HANGING AMONG THE ROCKS OF THE NEARLY PERPENDICULAR ASCENT
I FEAR MY FRIEND THAT I SHALL RENDER MYSELF TEDIOUS BY DWELLING ON THESE PRELIMINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY WERE DAYS OF COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS AND I THINK OF THEM WITH PLEASURE MY COUNTRY MY BELOVED COUNTRY
YOU PERHAPS WILL FIND SOME MEANS TO JUSTIFY MY POOR GUILTLESS JUSTINE ALAS WHO IS SAFE IF SHE BE CONVICTED OF CRIME I RELY ON HER INNOCENCE AS CERTAINLY AS I DO UPON MY OWN OUR MISFORTUNE IS DOUBLY HARD TO US
THE MORNING ON WHICH THE MURDER OF POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN DISCOVERED JUSTINE HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AND CONFINED TO HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS DURING THIS INTERVAL ONE OF THE SERVANTS HAPPENING TO EXAMINE THE APPAREL SHE HAD WORN ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER
BUT WITH FEELINGS OF PEACE AND GENTLENESS THAT WILL HEAL INSTEAD OF FESTERING THE WOUNDS OF OUR MINDS ENTER THE HOUSE OF MOURNING MY FRIEND BUT WITH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION FOR THOSE WHO LOVE YOU AND NOT WITH HATRED FOR YOUR ENEMIES
BESIDES THE STRANGE NATURE OF THE ANIMAL WOULD ELUDE ALL PURSUIT EVEN IF I WERE SO FAR CREDITED AS TO PERSUADE MY RELATIVES TO COMMENCE IT AND THEN OF WHAT USE WOULD BE PURSUIT WHO COULD ARREST A CREATURE CAPABLE OF SCALING THE OVERHANGING SIDES OF MONT SALEVE
CLERVAL WHO HAD WATCHED MY COUNTENANCE AS I READ THIS LETTER WAS SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEEDED THE JOY I AT FIRST EXPRESSED ON RECEIVING NEW FROM MY FRIENDS
HE THREATENED AND MENACED UNTIL I ALMOST BEGAN TO THINK THAT I WAS THE MONSTER THAT HE SAID I WAS HE THREATENED EXCOMMUNICATION AND HELL FIRE IN MY LAST MOMENTS IF I CONTINUED OBDURATE
BUT WORDS CANNOT CONVEY AN IDEA OF THE HEART SICKENING DESPAIR THAT I THEN ENDURED THE PERSON TO WHOM I ADDRESSED MYSELF ADDED THAT JUSTINE HAD ALREADY CONFESSED HER GUILT THAT EVIDENCE HE OBSERVED
WHO HAD GONE ON BEFORE WERE NOT TO BE FOUND WE ACCORDINGLY RESTED ON A SEAT UNTIL THEY SHOULD RETURN PRESENTLY ERNEST CAME AND ENQUIRED IF WE HAD SEEN HIS BROTHER HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN PLAYING WITH HIM
WE DO ALSO UNFORTUNATELY REPLIED MY FATHER FOR INDEED I HAD RATHER HAVE BEEN FOR EVER IGNORANT THAN HAVE DISCOVERED SO MUCH DEPRAVITY AND UNGRATITUDE IN ONE I VALUED SO HIGHLY MY DEAR FATHER YOU ARE MISTAKEN JUSTINE IS INNOCENT
ELIZABETH SAW EVEN THIS LAST RESOURCE HER EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS AND IRREPROACHABLE CONDUCT ABOUT TO FAIL THE ACCUSED WHEN ALTHOUGH VIOLENTLY AGITATED SHE DESIRED PERMISSION TO ADDRESS THE COURT
THE STORM APPEARED TO APPROACH RAPIDLY AND ON LANDING I ASCENDED A LOW HILL THAT I MIGHT OBSERVE ITS PROGRESS IT ADVANCED THE HEAVENS WERE CLOUDED AND I SOON FELT THE RAIN COMING SLOWLY IN LARGE DROPS BUT ITS VIOLENCE QUICKLY INCREASED
SEE THE BLOOD IS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE ONE WOULD SCARCELY EXPECT TO SEE THESE VARLETS OF THE CITY PLAYING SO ROUGHLY THE CITIZENS HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES STURDY FIGHTERS BEFORE NOW MY PRINCE THE OTHER SAID THEY ARE EVER INDEPENDENT AND HOLD TO THEIR RIGHTS EVEN AGAINST THE KING
A PLAIN STONE WITH THE NAME DAME ALICE SOMERS MARKING THE GRAVE THE BOY GREW AND THROVE UNTIL AT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD THERE WAS NO STRONGER OR STURDIER LAD OF HIS AGE WITHIN THE CITY BOUNDS
AS ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS WOULD CONCEAL HIS FIGURE HE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT TREAD IN A POOL OR DITCH AND SO BETRAY HIS PRESENCE PUTTING HIS FOOT EACH TIME TO THE GROUND WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION HE MOVED QUIETLY AFTER THEM
THAT HIS SON'S HEAD HAD BEEN BADLY CUT BY A BLOW WITH A CLUB FROM WALTER FLETCHER
SHE WAS LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH WET AND HARDSHIP AND DOUBTLESS THEY TOOK ALL THE MORE EFFECT BECAUSE SHE WAS LOW IN SPIRIT AND WEAKENED WITH MUCH GRIEVING THAT NIGHT SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SORT OF FEVER HOT AND COLD BY TURNS AND AT TIMES OFF HER HEAD
WHETHER TO INFORM HIS MASTER OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE WAS HOWEVER BENT UPON HAVING AN ADVENTURE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND
THAT DID HE TAKE LESS PAINS HE WOULD THRIVE MORE BUT HE HANDLES EACH BOW THAT HE MAKES AS IF HE LOVED IT AND FINISHES AND POLISHES EACH WITH HIS OWN HAND THEREFORE HE DOETH NOT SO MUCH TRADE AS THOSE WHO ARE LESS PARTICULAR WITH THEIR WARES
AND BARING THEIR HEADS STOOD STILL IN CONFUSION NO HARM IS DONE THE PRINCE SAID
WHY DO YOU NOT PLAY MORE QUIETLY THE FEUDS BETWEEN THE BOYS OF DIFFERENT WARDS ARE BECOMING A SERIOUS NUISANCE AND MANY INJURIES HAVE BEEN INFLICTED
THE SOONER YOU WILL BE OUT OF YOUR TIME AND SINCE MADGE MARRIED EIGHT YEARS SINCE I HAVE BEEN LONELY IN THE HOUSE AND SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH ME GEOFFREY WARD FOUND HIS FRIEND MORE READY TO ACCEDE TO HIS REQUEST
AND IT WAS SAID THAT MANY WHO WERE THOUGHT TO BE OF HER PARTY HAD BEEN ATTACKED AND SLAIN AND I HEARD AND THERE HE STOPPED YOU HEARD RIGHTLY GOOD GILES IT IS ALL TRUE A WEEK AFTER THE SLAYING OF MORTIMER
AS SOON AS THE BOY COULD HANDLE A LIGHT TOOL GEOFFREY ALLOWED HIM TO WORK AND ALTHOUGH NOT ABLE TO WIELD THE HEAVY SLEDGE WALTER WAS ABLE TO DO MUCH OF THE FINER WORK
AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN WALTER HAD WON THE PRIZE AT THE SPORTS BOTH FOR THE BEST CUDGEL PLAY AND THE BEST SWORD AND BUCKLER PLAY AMONG THE APPRENTICES TO THE GREAT DISGUST OF MANY WHO HAD ALMOST REACHED THE AGE OF MANHOOD AND WERE JUST OUT OF THEIR TIME
AND MY TWO MEN ARE HARD AT WORK MENDING ARMOUR AND FITTING SWORDS TO HILTS AND FORGING PIKE HEADS YOU SEE
TO A FELLOW CREATURE ON SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT FELLOW CREATURE IS A WOMAN WITH A CHILD POOR LITTLE CHAP HE LOOKS RIGHT WELL AND STURDY AND SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN NO ILL FROM HIS JOURNEY
I HAVE PASSED THEM THE WOMAN SAID BUT ALL SEEMED FULL OF ROISTERERS I AM WET AND WEARY AND MY STRENGTH IS NIGH SPENT I CAN PAY THEE GOOD FELLOW AND I PRAY YOU AS A CHRISTIAN TO LET ME COME IN AND SLEEP BEFORE YOUR FIRE FOR THE NIGHT
THE TIDE WAS RUNNING DOWN STRONGLY
HEAVY BLOWS WERE EXCHANGED AND BLOOD FLOWED FREELY FROM MANY OF THEIR HEADS AND FACES FOR IN THOSE DAYS BOYS THOUGHT LESS THAN THEY DO NOW OF HARD KNOCKS AND MANLINESS AND COURAGE WERE CONSIDERED THE FIRST OF VIRTUES
HER BROTHER WHO BUT A YEAR AGO BECAME LORD OF BROOMECASTLE AT THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THE QUEEN'S MEN AND IT WAS HE I BELIEVE WHO BROUGHT SIR ROLAND SOMERS TO THAT SIDE HE WAS SLAIN ON THE SAME NIGHT AS MORTIMER
MORE THAN ONCE SURLY MEN HAD ACCOSTED HIM AND HAD THREATENED TO KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD IF THEY AGAIN FOUND HIM WANDERING THAT WAY BUT WALTER LAUGHED AT THEIR THREATS
WHAT IS THY NAME GOOD LAD THE PRINCE ASKED I AM KNOWN AS WALTER FLETCHER YOU ARE A BRAVE LAD THE PRINCE SAID AND IF YOU BEAR YOU AS WELL AS A MAN AS YOU DID BUT NOW
GEOFFREY WARD ENTERED THE SHOP OF GILES FLETCHER I HAVE BROUGHT YOU TWENTY SCORE OF ARROWHEADS MASTER GILES HE SAID THEY HAVE BEEN LONGER IN HAND THAN IS USUAL WITH ME BUT I HAVE BEEN PRESSED AND HOW GOES IT WITH THE LADY WHOM I BROUGHT TO YOUR DOOR LAST WEEK
IS ALWAYS HANDY IN TIMES LIKE THESE
OR GIVE TESTIMONY WHICH WOULD COST THE LIFE OF A FELLOW CREATURE THE CITIZENS OF LONDON WERE LOUD IN THEIR COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE DISCHARGED SOLDIERS
FOR GREAT TRACTS OF FORESTS STILL COVERED A LARGE PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
FOR THE LIGHT IS WANING FAST IT WERE ILL FOR ANYONE I CAUGHT PRYING ABOUT HERE BUT COME IN SIR KNIGHT MY HOVEL IS NOT WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP IS ACCUSTOMED TO BUT WE MAY AS WELL TALK THERE AS HERE BENEATH THE SKY THE TWO MEN DISAPPEARED FROM WALTER'S SIGHT THE LATTER
IT WAS FINE NOW BUT THE STREAM WAS RUNNING DOWN THICK AND TURBID
GEOFFREY WAS FAR MORE SYMPATHETIC AND SAID WELL WALTER ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT THAT GAFFER GILES HEARD ME SAY SO I THINK YOU HAVE HAD A PIECE OF RARE GOOD FORTUNE
HE HAD PARTICULARLY NOTICED HIM BECAUSE OF THE ARROGANT MANNER IN WHICH HE SPOKE WALTER HAD HIMSELF PUT IN THE RIVETS AND HAD THOUGHT AS HE BUCKLED ON THE ARMOUR AGAIN HOW UNPLEASANT A COUNTENANCE WAS THAT OF ITS WEARER
CITIZEN'S SON THOUGH HE BE MY LORD DE VAUX WILL YOU BID YOUR SQUIRE RIDE AT FULL SPEED TO THE TOWER AND TELL MASTER ROGER THE LEECH TO COME HERE WITH ALL HASTE
TEACH HIM TO BE HONEST AND TRUE IT WERE BETTER METHINKS THAT HE GREW UP THINKING YOU HIS FATHER AND MOTHER FOR OTHERWISE HE MAY GROW DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT
WHAT A JOY IT WILL BE TO HER TO SEE YOU AGAIN SO SAYING GILES LED THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT ABOVE THERE WAS A SCREAM OF SURPRISE AND JOY FROM HIS WIFE AND THEN GILES QUIETLY WITHDREW DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN
HE WAS UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DISAPPEARANCE THEN HE SAW THAT THE SPOT ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY A MERE CLUMP OF BUSHES NO HIGHER THAN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS REALLY AN ELEVATED HUMMOCK OF GROUND
HE IS TO BE CONVOYED NEITHER BY GODS NOR MEN BUT AFTER A PERILOUS VOYAGE OF TWENTY DAYS UPON A RAFT
AS HE ROSE ON THE SWELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY AHEAD AND COULD SEE LAND QUITE NEAR THEN AS CHILDREN REJOICE WHEN THEIR DEAR FATHER BEGINS TO GET BETTER AFTER HAVING FOR A LONG TIME BORNE SORE AFFLICTION SENT HIM BY SOME ANGRY SPIRIT
AS ONE WHO HAS BEEN ALL DAY PLOUGHING A FALLOW FIELD WITH A COUPLE OF OXEN KEEPS THINKING ABOUT HIS SUPPER AND IS GLAD WHEN NIGHT COMES THAT HE MAY GO AND GET IT FOR IT IS ALL HIS LEGS CAN DO TO CARRY HIM
HE CUT DOWN TWENTY TREES IN ALL AND ADZED THEM SMOOTH SQUARING THEM BY RULE IN GOOD WORKMANLIKE FASHION MEANWHILE CALYPSO CAME BACK WITH SOME AUGERS SO HE BORED HOLES WITH THEM AND FITTED THE TIMBERS TOGETHER WITH BOLTS AND RIVETS
THE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS TO LIFT ULYSSES WITH HIS RUG AND LINEN SHEET OUT OF THE SHIP AND LAY HIM DOWN UPON THE SAND STILL FAST ASLEEP
MOREOVER SHE MADE THE WIND FAIR AND WARM FOR HIM AND GLADLY DID ULYSSES SPREAD HIS SAIL BEFORE IT WHILE HE SAT AND GUIDED THE RAFT SKILFULLY BY MEANS OF THE RUDDER
WHEN HE WAS IN THIS PLIGHT INO DAUGHTER OF CADMUS ALSO CALLED LEUCOTHEA SAW HIM SHE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A MERE MORTAL BUT HAD BEEN SINCE RAISED TO THE RANK OF A MARINE GODDESS
THEY HURRIED DOWN TO THE SHIP AND BROUGHT THEIR CAULDRONS WITH THEM ALCINOUS WENT ON BOARD AND SAW EVERYTHING SO SECURELY STOWED UNDER THE SHIP'S BENCHES THAT NOTHING COULD BREAK ADRIFT AND INJURE THE ROWERS
HE EXCLAIMED AMONG WHAT MANNER OF PEOPLE AM I FALLEN ARE THEY SAVAGE AND UNCIVILISED OR HOSPITABLE AND HUMANE WHERE SHALL I PUT ALL THIS TREASURE AND WHICH WAY SHALL I GO
BUT NOW THEY HAVE BROUGHT HIM IN A SHIP FAST ASLEEP AND HAVE LANDED HIM IN ITHACA AFTER LOADING HIM WITH MORE MAGNIFICENT PRESENTS OF BRONZE GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD EVER HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
LET US NOW THEREFORE PRESENT HIM FURTHER EACH ONE OF US WITH A LARGE TRIPOD AND A CAULDRON WE WILL RECOUP OURSELVES BY THE LEVY OF A GENERAL RATE
BUT MINERVA RESOLVED TO HELP ULYSSES SO SHE BOUND THE WAYS OF ALL THE WINDS EXCEPT ONE AND MADE THEM LIE QUITE STILL BUT SHE ROUSED A GOOD STIFF BREEZE FROM THE NORTH THAT SHOULD LAY THE WATERS TILL ULYSSES REACHED THE LAND OF THE PHAEACIANS WHERE HE WOULD BE SAFE
HE ALSO MADE A MAST WITH A YARD ARM AND A RUDDER TO STEER WITH HE FENCED THE RAFT ALL ROUND WITH WICKER HURDLES AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THE WAVES AND THEN HE THREW ON A QUANTITY OF WOOD BY AND BY
AND LET ME SET REFRESHMENT BEFORE YOU AS SHE SPOKE SHE DREW A TABLE LOADED WITH AMBROSIA BESIDE HIM AND MIXED HIM SOME RED NECTAR SO MERCURY ATE AND DRANK TILL HE HAD HAD ENOUGH
THEN SHE DIVED DOWN AGAIN LIKE A SEA GULL AND VANISHED BENEATH THE DARK BLUE WATERS BUT ULYSSES DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY
YOUR PEOPLE AND WITH KING ALCINOUS AS HE SPOKE HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AND ALCINOUS SENT A MAN TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS SHIP AND TO THE SEA SHORE
I AM NOW SAFE TO PERISH BLEST AND THRICE BLEST WERE THOSE DANAANS WHO FELL BEFORE TROY IN THE CAUSE OF THE SONS OF ATREUS WOULD THAT I HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE DAY WHEN THE TROJANS WERE PRESSING ME SO SORELY ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF ACHILLES
BUT PRESENTLY THE WAVE CAME ON AGAIN AND CARRIED HIM BACK WITH IT FAR INTO THE SEA TEARING HIS HANDS AS THE SUCKERS OF A POLYPUS ARE TORN WHEN SOME ONE PLUCKS IT FROM ITS BED
TURNED IT INTO STONE AND DROVE IT DOWN WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HAND SO AS TO ROOT IT IN THE GROUND AFTER THIS HE WENT AWAY THE PHAEACIANS THEN BEGAN TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES AND ONE WOULD TURN TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBOUR
DAYS SEVEN AND TEN DID HE SAIL OVER THE SEA AND ON THE EIGHTEENTH THE DIM OUTLINES OF THE MOUNTAINS ON THE NEAREST PART OF THE PHAEACIAN COAST APPEARED RISING LIKE A SHIELD ON THE HORIZON
AND HERE HE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR THERE WERE NO ROCKS AND IT AFFORDED SHELTER FROM THE WIND HE FELT THAT THERE WAS A CURRENT SO HE PRAYED INWARDLY AND SAID HEAR ME O KING WHOEVER YOU MAY BE
WHY IS NEPTUNE SO FURIOUSLY ANGRY WITH YOU HE IS GIVING YOU A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE BUT FOR ALL HIS BLUSTER HE WILL NOT KILL YOU YOU SEEM TO BE A SENSIBLE PERSON DO THEN AS I BID YOU STRIP
CALYPSO BROUGHT HIM SOME LINEN TO MAKE THE SAILS AND HE MADE THESE TOO EXCELLENTLY MAKING THEM FAST WITH BRACES AND SHEETS LAST OF ALL WITH THE HELP OF LEVERS HE DREW THE RAFT DOWN INTO THE WATER IN FOUR DAYS
I AM SO EXHAUSTED THAT THE BITTER COLD AND DAMP MAY MAKE AN END OF ME FOR TOWARDS SUNRISE THERE WILL BE A KEEN WIND BLOWING FROM OFF THE RIVER IF ON THE OTHER HAND I CLIMB THE HILL SIDE FIND SHELTER IN THE WOODS AND SLEEP IN SOME THICKET
HIS ORDERS HE SAYS THAT YOU HAVE HERE THE MOST ILL STARRED OF ALL THOSE WHO FOUGHT NINE YEARS BEFORE THE CITY OF KING PRIAM AND SAILED HOME IN THE TENTH YEAR AFTER HAVING SACKED IT
FOR THERE WAS A GREAT LITTER OF DEAD LEAVES LYING ABOUT ENOUGH TO MAKE A COVERING FOR TWO OR THREE MEN EVEN IN HARD WINTER WEATHER HE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO SEE THIS SO HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND HEAPED THE LEAVES ALL ROUND HIM
AND THEN SAID WE ARE SPEAKING GOD AND GODDESS TO ONE ANOTHER AND YOU ASK ME WHY I HAVE COME HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU TRULY AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO JOVE SENT ME IT WAS NO DOING OF MINE
THERE HE CREPT BENEATH TWO SHOOTS OF OLIVE THAT GREW FROM A SINGLE STOCK THE ONE AN UNGRAFTED SUCKER WHILE THE OTHER HAD BEEN GRAFTED NO WIND HOWEVER SQUALLY
AS HE SPOKE A SEA BROKE OVER HIM WITH SUCH TERRIFIC FURY THAT THE RAFT REELED AGAIN AND HE WAS CARRIED OVERBOARD A LONG WAY OFF
HE SAID TO THESE WE SHOULD BE COURTEOUS
THE CIRCLES LARGE AND THE DESCENT BE LITTLE THINK OF THE NOVEL BURDEN WHICH THOU HAST EVEN AS THE LITTLE VESSEL SHOVES FROM SHORE BACKWARD STILL BACKWARD SO HE THENCE WITHDREW AND WHEN HE WHOLLY FELT HIMSELF AFLOAT THERE WHERE HIS BREAST HAD BEEN HE TURNED HIS TAIL
MORE THAN HIS OTHER COMRADES QUIVERING I SAID AND WHOM A REDDER FLAME IS SUCKING AND HE TO ME IF THOU WILT HAVE ME BEAR THEE DOWN THERE ALONG THAT BANK WHICH LOWEST LIES
THUS FARTHER STILL UPON THE OUTERMOST HEAD OF THAT SEVENTH CIRCLE ALL ALONE I WENT WHERE SAT THE MELANCHOLY FOLK OUT OF THEIR EYES WAS GUSHING FORTH THEIR WOE THIS WAY THAT WAY THEY HELPED THEM WITH THEIR HANDS NOW FROM THE FLAMES AND NOW FROM THE HOT SOIL
SOON AS THE WATER DOTH BEGIN TO RUN NO MORE BENACO IS IT CALLED BUT MINCIO FAR AS GOVERNO WHERE IT FALLS IN PO NOT FAR IT RUNS BEFORE IT FINDS A PLAIN IN WHICH IT SPREADS ITSELF AND MAKES IT MARSHY
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM WERE THE SINNERS NAKED THIS SIDE THE MIDDLE CAME THEY FACING US BEYOND IT WITH US BUT WITH GREATER STEPS EVEN AS THE ROMANS FOR THE MIGHTY HOST THE YEAR OF JUBILEE UPON THE BRIDGE HAVE CHOSEN A MODE TO PASS THE PEOPLE OVER
AS SOON AS THIS MY LORD SAID UNTO ME WORDS ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH I THOUGHT WITHIN ME THAT PEOPLE SUCH AS YOU ARE WERE APPROACHING I OF YOUR CITY AM AND EVERMORE YOUR LABOURS AND YOUR HONOURABLE NAMES I WITH AFFECTION HAVE RETRACED AND HEARD
WHEN TO SEVER THE FIRST CABLE ERYPHYLUS HIS NAME WAS AND SO SINGS MY LOFTY TRAGEDY IN SOME PART OR OTHER THAT KNOWEST THOU WELL WHO KNOWEST THE WHOLE OF IT THE NEXT WHO IS SO SLENDER IN THE FLANKS WAS MICHAEL SCOTT
IF THOU CANST SPEAK OUT I STOOD EVEN AS THE FRIAR WHO IS CONFESSING THE FALSE ASSASSIN WHO WHEN HE IS FIXED RECALLS HIM SO THAT DEATH MAY BE DELAYED AND HE CRIED OUT DOST THOU STAND THERE ALREADY
HAVE I GREAT GRATITUDE FROM THEE
IT WAS NOT CLEAR IF HE WERE CLERK OR LAYMAN HE SCREAMED TO ME WHEREFORE ART THOU SO EAGER TO LOOK AT ME MORE THAN THE OTHER FOUL ONES AND I TO HIM BECAUSE IF I REMEMBER I HAVE ALREADY SEEN THEE WITH DRY HAIR
WHILE SPEAKING IN THIS MANNER WITH HIS SCOURGE A DEMON SMOTE HIM
AS IF BEMOCKED AND KNOW NOT HOW TO ANSWER THEN SAID VIRGILIUS SAY TO HIM STRAIGHTWAY I AM NOT HE I AM NOT HE THOU THINKEST AND I REPLIED AS WAS IMPOSED ON ME
BUT I PERCEIVE IT ONLY BY WIND UPON MY FACE AND FROM BELOW I HEARD ALREADY ON THE RIGHT THE WHIRLPOOL MAKING A HORRIBLE CRASHING UNDER US WHENCE I THRUST OUT MY HEAD WITH EYES CAST DOWNWARD THEN WAS I STILL MORE FEARFUL OF THE ABYSS
BUT ON THE BORDER DID NOT DRAG ITS TAIL THE FACE WAS AS THE FACE OF A JUST MAN ITS SEMBLANCE OUTWARDLY WAS SO BENIGN AND OF A SERPENT ALL THE TRUNK BESIDE TWO PAWS IT HAD HAIRY UNTO THE ARMPITS
FOR AFTER HIM SHALL COME OF FOULER DEED FROM TOW'RDS THE WEST A PASTOR WITHOUT LAW SUCH AS BEFITS TO COVER HIM AND ME NEW JASON WILL HE BE OF WHOM WE READ IN MACCABEES AND AS HIS KING WAS PLIANT SO HE WHO GOVERNS FRANCE SHALL BE TO THIS ONE
NOT THE SOLE BOLOGNESE AM I WHO WEEPS HERE NAY RATHER IS THIS PLACE SO FULL OF THEM THAT NOT SO MANY TONGUES TO DAY ARE TAUGHT TWIXT RENO AND SAVENA TO SAY SIPA AND IF THEREOF THOU WISHEST PLEDGE OR PROOF BRING TO THY MIND OUR AVARICIOUS HEART
TAKE HEED THAT THOU EMBRACE ME BUT HE WHO OTHER TIMES HAD RESCUED ME IN OTHER PERIL SOON AS I HAD MOUNTED WITHIN HIS ARMS ENCIRCLED AND SUSTAINED ME
AFTER I THIS HAD ALL FROM ME UNLOOSED AS MY CONDUCTOR HAD COMMANDED ME I REACHED IT TO HIM GATHERED UP AND COILED WHEREAT HE TURNED HIMSELF TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE VERGE HE CAST IT DOWN INTO THAT DEEP ABYSS
AND WHICH THE SCOURGES IN LIKE MANNER SMITE AND THE GOOD MASTER WITHOUT MY INQUIRING SAID TO ME SEE THAT TALL ONE WHO IS COMING AND FOR HIS PAIN SEEMS NOT TO SHED A TEAR STILL WHAT A ROYAL ASPECT HE RETAINS THAT JASON IS
I LEAVE THE GALL AND GO FOR THE SWEET FRUITS PROMISED TO ME BY THE VERACIOUS LEADER BUT TO THE CENTRE FIRST I NEEDS MUST PLUNGE SO MAY THE SOUL FOR A LONG WHILE CONDUCT THOSE LIMBS OF THINE DID HE MAKE ANSWER THEN
AND TRULY WAS I SON OF THE SHE BEAR SO EAGER TO ADVANCE THE CUBS THAT WEALTH ABOVE AND HERE MYSELF I POCKETED BENEATH MY HEAD THE OTHERS ARE DRAGGED DOWN WHO HAVE PRECEDED ME IN SIMONY FLATTENED ALONG THE FISSURE OF THE ROCK
THENCE WE HEARD PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING MOAN IN THE NEXT BOLGIA SNORTING WITH THEIR MUZZLES AND WITH THEIR PALMS BEATING UPON THEMSELVES THE MARGINS WERE INCRUSTED WITH A MOULD BY EXHALATION FROM BELOW THAT STICKS THERE AND WITH THE EYES AND NOSTRILS WAGES WAR
HE SAID TO ME SOON THERE WILL UPWARD COME WHAT I AWAIT AND WHAT THY THOUGHT IS DREAMING MUST SOON REVEAL ITSELF UNTO THY SIGHT
THE GUIDE SAID WAIT AND SEE THAT ON THEE STRIKE THE VISION OF THOSE OTHERS EVIL BORN OF WHOM THOU HAST NOT YET BEHELD THE FACES BECAUSE TOGETHER WITH US THEY HAVE GONE FROM THE OLD BRIDGE WE LOOKED UPON THE TRAIN WHICH TOW'RDS US CAME UPON THE OTHER BORDER
WHO NOW UNTO HIS LEATHER AND HIS THREAD WOULD FAIN HAVE STUCK BUT HE TOO LATE REPENTS BEHOLD THE WRETCHED ONES WHO LEFT THE NEEDLE THE SPOOL AND ROCK AND MADE THEM FORTUNE TELLERS THEY WROUGHT THEIR MAGIC SPELLS WITH HERB AND IMAGE
FOR ALL UPON ONE SIDE TOWARDS THE CASTLE THEIR FACES HAVE AND GO UNTO SAINT PETER'S ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY GO TOWARDS THE MOUNTAIN THIS SIDE AND THAT ALONG THE LIVID STONE BEHELD I HORNED DEMONS WITH GREAT SCOURGES
WHO CRUELLY WERE BEATING THEM BEHIND AH ME HOW THEY DID MAKE THEM LIFT THEIR LEGS AT THE FIRST BLOWS AND SOOTH NOT ANY ONE THE SECOND WAITED FOR NOR FOR THE THIRD WHILE I WAS GOING ON MINE EYES BY ONE ENCOUNTERED WERE AND STRAIGHT I SAID
I FOUND MY GUIDE WHO HAD ALREADY MOUNTED UPON THE BACK OF THAT WILD ANIMAL AND SAID TO ME NOW BE BOTH STRONG AND BOLD NOW WE DESCEND BY STAIRWAYS SUCH AS THESE MOUNT THOU IN FRONT FOR I WILL BE MIDWAY SO THAT THE TAIL MAY HAVE NO POWER TO HARM THEE
TIS RIGHT WHERE ONE IS TO BRING IN THE OTHER THAT AS THEY WERE UNITED IN THEIR WARFARE TOGETHER LIKEWISE MAY THEIR GLORY SHINE THE SOLDIERY OF CHRIST WHICH IT HAD COST SO DEAR TO ARM AGAIN BEHIND THE STANDARD MOVED SLOW AND DOUBTFUL AND IN NUMBERS FEW
AND THAT WHICH DIETH NOT ARE NOTHING BUT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE IDEA WHICH BY HIS LOVE OUR LORD BRINGS INTO BEING BECAUSE THAT LIVING LIGHT WHICH FROM ITS FOUNT EFFULGENT FLOWS SO THAT IT DISUNITES NOT FROM HIM NOR FROM THE LOVE IN THEM INTRINED
KNIGHTHOOD AND PRIVILEGE FROM HIM RECEIVED THOUGH WITH THE POPULACE UNITES HIMSELF TO DAY THE MAN WHO BINDS IT WITH A BORDER ALREADY WERE GUALTEROTTI AND IMPORTUNI AND STILL MORE QUIET WOULD THE BORGO BE IF WITH NEW NEIGHBOURS IT REMAINED UNFED
SO THAT FIRE SEEMED IT BEHIND ALABASTER THUS PITEOUS DID ANCHISES SHADE REACH FORWARD IF ANY FAITH OUR GREATEST MUSE DESERVE WHEN IN ELYSIUM HE HIS SON PERCEIVED
THE MOMENT WHEN SHE FELT THE FROST OF DEATH AND ONE TO HAVE ITS RAYS WITHIN THE OTHER AND BOTH TO WHIRL THEMSELVES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE SHOULD FORWARD GO THE OTHER BACKWARD
AND IF IT DO REMAIN SAY IN WHAT MANNER AFTER YE ARE AGAIN MADE VISIBLE IT CAN BE THAT IT INJURE NOT YOUR SIGHT AS BY A GREATER GLADNESS URGED AND DRAWN THEY WHO ARE DANCING IN A RING SOMETIMES UPLIFT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR MOTIONS QUICKEN
NOT THROUGH ITSELF BUT HIM WHO SITS THERE AND DEGENERATES NOT TO DISPENSE OR TWO OR THREE FOR SIX NOT ANY FORTUNE OF FIRST VACANCY NON DECIMAS QUAE SUNT PAUPERUM DEI
NOT YET THE DAUGHTER AT HER BIRTH STRUCK FEAR INTO THE FATHER FOR THE TIME AND DOWER DID NOT O'ERRUN THIS SIDE OR THAT THE MEASURE NO HOUSES HAD SHE VOID OF FAMILIES NOT YET HAD THITHER COME SARDANAPALUS TO SHOW WHAT IN A CHAMBER CAN BE DONE
BY GRACE OF HER WHO TO THIS LOFTY FLIGHT WITH PLUMAGE CLOTHED THEE THOU THINKEST THAT TO ME THY THOUGHT DOTH PASS FROM HIM WHO IS THE FIRST AS FROM THE UNIT IF THAT BE KNOWN RAY OUT THE FIVE AND SIX AND THEREFORE
AND ALREADY GALIGAJO HAD HILT AND POMMEL GILDED IN HIS HOUSE MIGHTY ALREADY WAS THE COLUMN VAIR SACCHETTI GIUOCHI FIFANT AND BARUCCI AND GALLI AND THEY WHO FOR THE BUSHEL BLUSH
HERE DOTH MY MEMORY OVERCOME MY GENIUS FOR ON THAT CROSS AS LEVIN GLEAMED FORTH CHRIST SO THAT I CANNOT FIND ENSAMPLE WORTHY BUT HE WHO TAKES HIS CROSS AND FOLLOWS CHRIST AGAIN WILL PARDON ME WHAT I OMIT SEEING IN THAT AURORA LIGHTEN CHRIST
AS AT THE BLOWING OF THE WINDS A COAL QUICKENS TO FLAME SO I BEHELD THAT LIGHT BECOME RESPLENDENT AT MY BLANDISHMENTS AND AS UNTO MINE EYES IT GREW MORE FAIR WITH VOICE MORE SWEET AND TENDER BUT NOT IN THIS MODERN DIALECT IT SAID TO ME
AND IN ITS GYRE HAD NOT TURNED WHOLLY ROUND BEFORE ANOTHER IN A RING ENCLOSED IT AND MOTION JOINED TO MOTION SONG TO SONG SONG THAT AS GREATLY DOTH TRANSCEND OUR MUSES OUR SIRENS IN THOSE DULCET CLARIONS AS PRIMAL SPLENDOUR THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED
SILENT AND WAKEFUL MANY A TIME WAS HE DISCOVERED BY HIS NURSE UPON THE GROUND AS IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID FOR THIS I CAME O THOU HIS FATHER FELIX VERILY O THOU HIS MOTHER VERILY JOANNA IF THIS INTERPRETED MEANS AS IS SAID
WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE SWEET WEST WIND RISES TO OPEN THE NEW LEAVES WHEREWITH EUROPE IS SEEN TO CLOTHE HERSELF AFRESH NOT FAR OFF FROM THE BEATING OF THE WAVES BEHIND WHICH IN HIS LONG CAREER THE SUN SOMETIMES CONCEALS HIMSELF FROM EVERY MAN
BUT THAT THE SACRED LOVE IN WHICH I WATCH WITH SIGHT PERPETUAL AND WHICH MAKES ME THIRST WITH SWEET DESIRE MAY BETTER BE FULFILLED NOW LET THY VOICE SECURE AND FRANK AND GLAD PROCLAIM THE WISHES THE DESIRE PROCLAIM TO WHICH MY ANSWER IS DECREED ALREADY
BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHENCE THEY THITHER CAME SILENCE IS MORE CONSIDERATE THAN SPEECH ALL THOSE WHO AT THAT TIME WERE THERE BETWEEN MARS AND THE BAPTIST FIT FOR BEARING ARMS WERE A FIFTH PART OF THOSE WHO NOW ARE LIVING BUT THE COMMUNITY THAT NOW IS MIXED
ITS BRIGHTNESS IS PROPORTIONED TO THE ARDOUR THE ARDOUR TO THE VISION AND THE VISION EQUALS WHAT GRACE IT HAS ABOVE ITS WORTH WHEN GLORIOUS AND SANCTIFIED OUR FLESH IS REASSUMED THEN SHALL OUR PERSONS BE MORE PLEASING BY THEIR BEING ALL COMPLETE
AND WHEN THE BOW OF BURNING SYMPATHY WAS SO FAR SLACKENED THAT ITS SPEECH DESCENDED TOWARDS THE MARK OF OUR INTELLIGENCE THE FIRST THING THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY ME WAS BENEDIGHT BE THOU O TRINE AND ONE
DIVERSELY FEATHERED IN THEIR PINIONS ARE WHENCE I WHO MORTAL AM FEEL IN MYSELF THIS INEQUALITY SO GIVE NOT THANKS SAVE IN MY HEART FOR THIS PATERNAL WELCOME TRULY DO I ENTREAT THEE LIVING TOPAZ SET IN THIS PRECIOUS JEWEL AS A GEM
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THIRTY MORE TO REINFLAME ITSELF BENEATH HIS PAW MY ANCESTORS AND I OUR BIRTHPLACE HAD WHERE FIRST IS FOUND THE LAST WARD OF THE CITY BY HIM WHO RUNNETH IN YOUR ANNUAL GAME SUFFICE IT OF MY ELDERS TO HEAR THIS
FROM UTTERING OF THE AVE TILL THE BIRTH IN WHICH MY MOTHER WHO IS NOW A SAINT OF ME WAS LIGHTENED WHO HAD BEEN HER BURDEN
MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
DOMINIC WAS HE CALLED AND HIM I SPEAK OF EVEN AS OF THE HUSBANDMAN WHOM CHRIST ELECTED TO HIS GARDEN TO ASSIST HIM ENVOY AND SERVANT SOOTH HE SEEMED OF CHRIST FOR THE FIRST LOVE MADE MANIFEST IN HIM WAS THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT WAS GIVEN BY CHRIST
AND SEEMS TO BE A STAR THAT CHANGETH PLACE EXCEPT THAT IN THE PART WHERE IT IS KINDLED NOTHING IS MISSED AND THIS ENDURETH LITTLE SO FROM THE HORN THAT TO THE RIGHT EXTENDS UNTO THAT CROSS'S FOOT THERE RAN A STAR OUT OF THE CONSTELLATION SHINING THERE
SO AT THAT ORISON DEVOUT AND PROMPT THE HOLY CIRCLES A NEW JOY DISPLAYED IN THEIR REVOLVING AND THEIR WONDROUS SONG WHOSO LAMENTETH HIM THAT HERE WE DIE THAT WE MAY LIVE ABOVE HAS NEVER THERE SEEN THE REFRESHMENT OF THE ETERNAL RAIN
I RAN TO THE HOSPITAL AND LEARNED THAT THE SAME NIGHT THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER A CHILD HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE WRAPPED IN PART OF A FINE LINEN NAPKIN PURPOSELY TORN IN HALF THIS PORTION OF THE NAPKIN WAS MARKED WITH HALF A BARON'S CROWN
AND THEY OBEYED AND FROM THAT TIME HE GREW RICHER THAN EVER AND THE YOUTH RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER AND TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE ADVICE WHICH CHANDO HAD GIVEN TO THE TWO MEN AND ACTED ACCORDINGLY
A MAN MAY MURDER ANOTHER OUT OF REVENGE BUT HE WOULD NOT DELIBERATELY DROWN A CHILD PERHAPS CONTINUED VILLEFORT HE HAD PUT IT IN THE FOUNDLING HOSPITAL OH YES YES CRIED THE BARONESS MY CHILD IS THERE
WHAT THEN ASKED HERMINE TREMBLING VIOLENTLY SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE MORE FATAL MORE ALARMING FOR US THE CHILD WAS PERHAPS ALIVE AND THE ASSASSIN MAY HAVE SAVED IT
NIGHT ARRIVED I ALLOWED IT TO BECOME QUITE DARK I WAS WITHOUT A LIGHT IN THAT ROOM WHEN THE WIND SHOOK ALL THE DOORS BEHIND WHICH I CONTINUALLY EXPECTED TO SEE SOME SPY CONCEALED I TREMBLED
BUT YOU SAID REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS HE WOULD REQUIRE IT AS A PROOF AH NO MADAME THAT COULD NOT BE DEAD BODIES ARE NOT KEPT A YEAR THEY ARE SHOWN TO A MAGISTRATE AND THE EVIDENCE IS TAKEN NOW NOTHING OF THE KIND HAS HAPPENED
WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW THE PALE MOON SHEDDING A LONG STREAM OF WHITE LIGHT ON THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE LIKE A SPECTRE I LEANED AGAINST THE WALL AND NEARLY SHRIEKED I SEEMED TO BE GOING MAD AT LAST I MASTERED MY AGITATION
DOUBTLESS HE IS CAPRICIOUS BUT THAT IS ALL ONE THING ALONE STRUCK ME OF ALL THE EXQUISITE THINGS HE PLACED BEFORE US HE TOUCHED NOTHING I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED HE WAS POISONING US AND YOU SEE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED
POOR THING SAID VILLEFORT PRESSING HER HAND IT WAS TOO SEVERE FOR YOUR STRENGTH FOR YOU WERE TWICE OVERWHELMED AND YET WELL WELL I MUST TELL YOU COLLECT ALL YOUR COURAGE FOR YOU HAVE NOT YET HEARD ALL
THEN THE VILLAGERS MADE THEM SWEAR BY THEIR CHILDREN AND THE WOMAN AND THE HEADMAN LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE HEADS OF THEIR SONS AND SWORE AND WHEN THE WOMAN SWORE HER SON FELL DOWN DEAD AND SHE TOOK UP THE DEAD BODY IN HER ARMS AND RAN AWAY WITH IT
I UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD NOTHING TO FEAR THAT I SHOULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD SO I DECIDED UPON DESCENDING TO THE GARDEN
COME BEFORE HIM DISGUISED UNDER THE SPECIOUS FORM OF NECESSITY THEN AFTER ERROR HAS BEEN COMMITTED IN A MOMENT OF EXCITEMENT OF DELIRIUM OR OF FEAR WE SEE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED AND ESCAPED IT
AND HAD LEFT HOME IN THE CARRIAGE SHE DIRECTED HER COURSE TOWARDS THE FAUBOURG SAINT GERMAIN WENT DOWN THE RUE MAZARINE AND STOPPED AT THE PASSAGE DU PONT NEUF SHE DESCENDED AND WENT THROUGH THE PASSAGE
A COLD SHARP WIND WHISTLED THROUGH THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES AND YET THE DROPS FELL FROM MY FOREHEAD I RECOLLECTED THAT I WAS STABBED JUST AS I WAS TRAMPLING THE GROUND TO FILL UP THE HOLE WHILE DOING SO I HAD LEANED AGAINST A LABURNUM
SHE GAVE FIVE RUPEES TO THE VILLAGERS AND THEY MADE THE HEADMAN GIVE THEM TEN RUPEES FOR HAVING DECEIVED THEM AND THEY BOUGHT PIGS AND HAD A FEAST IN THE COURSE OF TIME THE BOY GREW UP AND HIS MOTHER URGED HIM TO MARRY HE ASKED HER
AND I DID NOT DARE INQUIRE FOR YOU WHEN I RETURNED TO PARIS I LEARNED THAT YOU
PERCEIVED THAT TO AVERT THE MATERNAL STORM GATHERING OVER HIS HEAD
WE KNOW OF NO GOLD COINS WHERE ARE YOUR WITNESSES YOU MUST HAVE HAD WITNESSES IN SUCH A BUSINESS AND THEY DROVE HER OUT SHE WENT AWAY CRYING AND CALLED THE VILLAGERS TOGETHER AND ASKED THEM TO DECIDE THE MATTER SO THEY QUESTIONED HER AND THE HEADMAN
YOU UNDERSTAND THEN THAT IF IT WERE SO SAID HE RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE BARONESS TO SPEAK TO HER IN A LOWER TONE WE ARE LOST THIS CHILD LIVES AND SOME ONE KNOWS IT LIVES SOME ONE IS IN POSSESSION OF OUR SECRET
HOW I HAVE LONGED FOR ROYAL WEALTH TO PURCHASE A MILLION OF SECRETS FROM A MILLION OF MEN AND TO FIND MINE AMONG THEM AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME I TOOK UP MY SPADE I ASKED MYSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN
THANKS MADAME THANKS FOR YOUR PUNCTUALITY AND HE OFFERED A CHAIR TO MADAME DANGLARS WHICH SHE ACCEPTED FOR HER HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE FELT NEARLY SUFFOCATED IT IS A LONG TIME MADAME SAID THE PROCUREUR
WOULD HE NOT ONE DAY MAKE YOU PAY FOR KEEPING THIS TERRIBLE SECRET WOULD IT NOT BE A SWEET REVENGE FOR HIM WHEN HE FOUND THAT I HAD NOT DIED FROM THE BLOW OF HIS DAGGER IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE AND AT ALL RISKS
THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN CALLING UPON HER LAWYER
DESCRIBING A HALF CIRCLE WITH HIS CHAIR SO AS TO PLACE HIMSELF EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO MADAME DANGLARS IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SPEAKING ALONE WITH YOU AND I REGRET THAT WE HAVE ONLY NOW MET TO ENTER UPON A PAINFUL CONVERSATION
I CONSIDER MYSELF AS BRAVE AS MOST MEN BUT WHEN I DREW FROM MY BREAST THE LITTLE KEY OF THE STAIRCASE WHICH I HAD FOUND IN MY COAT THAT LITTLE KEY WE BOTH USED TO CHERISH SO MUCH WHICH YOU WISHED TO HAVE FASTENED TO A GOLDEN RING
BUT IT HAD JUST BEEN LET FOR NINE YEARS I FOUND THE TENANT I PRETENDED THAT I DISLIKED THE IDEA THAT A HOUSE BELONGING TO MY WIFE'S FATHER AND MOTHER SHOULD PASS INTO THE HANDS OF STRANGERS
OH HEAVENS WHEN DAYLIGHT DAWNED I WENT DOWN AGAIN MY FIRST VISIT WAS TO THE THICKET I HOPED TO FIND SOME TRACES WHICH HAD ESCAPED ME IN THE DARKNESS
SO SHE WENT TO THE HEADMAN AND ASKED HIM FOR THEM BUT HE AND HIS WIFE SAID
FOR THE DECISION DOES NOT COME FROM YOU YOUR MISFORTUNES ARE GENERALLY IMPOSED UPON YOU AND YOUR FAULTS THE RESULTS OF OTHERS CRIMES IN ANY CASE SIR YOU WILL ALLOW REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS
THOUGH I HAD MADE A HOLE TWICE AS LARGE AS THE FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN DECEIVED HAD MISTAKEN THE SPOT I TURNED AROUND I LOOKED AT THE TREES I TRIED TO RECALL THE DETAILS WHICH HAD STRUCK ME AT THE TIME
EVERY MAN YOU MEET IN GRAUSTARK IS NOT A BRIGAND I TRUST FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE SIMPLE HUNTERS AND NOT WHAT WE MAY SEEM IT IS FORTUNATE THAT YOU HAVE FALLEN INTO HONEST HANDS THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE COACH HE ASKED QUICKLY ALERT
IT IS INDEED A STREET OF SO IMPERTINENT A NATURE SO UNFORTUNATELY CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT LONDON AND OXFORD ROADS AND THE PRINCIPAL INN OF THE CITY THAT A DAY NEVER PASSES IN WHICH PARTIES OF LADIES HOWEVER IMPORTANT THEIR BUSINESS
SHE UTTERED THE LAST OBSERVATION IN A LOUD VOICE AND IT HAD ITS EFFECT FOR THE LEADER CAME TO HER SIDE WITH LONG STRIDES CONVINCE YOUR SERVANT THAT WE MEAN NO HARM YOUR HIGHNESS HE SAID EAGERLY A NEW DEFERENCE IN HIS VOICE AND MANNER
PREVENTED HIS ACCEPTING THE INVITATION OF ONE FRIEND AND OBLIGED HIM TO HURRY AWAY AS SOON AS HE HAD SATISFIED THE DEMANDS OF THE OTHER
WE ARE NOT SO FAR FROM THE WORLD AFTER ALL WE ROUGH PEOPLE OF THE HILLS
HE RAN IT A FEW WEEKS TILL I BELIEVE IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT
A MISSTEP OR A FALSE TURN MIGHT EASILY START THE CLUMSY VEHICLE ROLLING DOWN THE DECLIVITY ON THE RIGHT THE CONVICT WAS TAKING DESPERATE CHANCES AND WITH A COOL CALCULATING BRAIN PREPARED TO LEAP TO THE GROUND IN CASE OF ACCIDENT
YOUR ESCORT HAS FLED AS THOUGH PURSUED BY SOMETHING STRONGER THAN SHADOWS YOUR DRIVER HAS DESERTED YOUR HORSES ARE HALF DEAD YOU ARE INDEED AS YOU HAVE SAID POWERLESS AND YOU ARE BESIDES ALL THESE
THE HORSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CHECKED WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH ALMOST THREW HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES
I AM POWERLESS I ONLY IMPLORE YOU TO TAKE WHAT VALUABLES YOU MAY FIND AND LET US PROCEED UNHARMED SHE CRIED RAPIDLY EAGER TO HAVE IT OVER PRAY HOW CAN YOUR HIGHNESS PROCEED YOU HAVE NO GUIDE NO DRIVER NO ESCORT
WITH SOME HESITATION FROM THE FEAR OF MORTIFYING HIM NO SURE WAS IT AYE I REMEMBER SO IT WAS I WAS THINKING OF THAT OTHER STUPID BOOK WRITTEN BY THAT WOMAN THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SHE WHO MARRIED THE FRENCH EMIGRANT
THE AWFUL ROCKING AND THE JOLTING GREW LESS SEVERE
IT WAS HAVE YOU EVER READ UDOLPHO MISTER THORPE UDOLPHO OH LORD NOT I I NEVER READ NOVELS I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO CATHERINE HUMBLED AND ASHAMED

BEVERLY CALHOUN SANK BACK INTO THE SEAT WEAK AND TERROR STRICKEN IT WAS PLAIN TO HER THAT THE HORSES WERE NOT RUNNING AWAY FOR THE MAN HAD BEEN LASHING THEM FURIOUSLY THERE WAS BUT ONE CONCLUSION
IT REMAINED ONLY FOR HER TO IMPRESS UPON AUNT FANNY THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS RESOLUTION WHAT WISE OLD HILLS THEY MUST BE SHE SAID WITH EVASIVE ENTHUSIASM YOU CANNOT EXPECT ME TO ADMIT HOWEVER THAT I AM THE PRINCESS SHE WENT ON
AND BY JOHN'S ENGAGING HER BEFORE THEY PARTED TO DANCE WITH HIM THAT EVENING HAD SHE BEEN OLDER OR VAINER SUCH ATTACKS MIGHT HAVE DONE LITTLE
THE MAN SHE HAD FIRST OBSERVED STOPPED NEAR THE HORSES HEADS AND PEERED INTENTLY AT HER FROM BENEATH A BROAD AND RAKISH HAT HE WAS TALL AND APPEARED TO BE MORE RESPECTABLY CLAD THAN HIS FELLOWS
I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN CAMILLA YES
AND THE PRAISE OF SUCH A GIRL AS MISS THORPE EVEN YOU CATHERINE
WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED WITH GREAT KINDNESS BY MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN INVITED BY THE FORMER TO DINE WITH THEM AND SUMMONED BY THE LATTER TO GUESS THE PRICE AND WEIGH THE MERITS OF A NEW MUFF AND TIPPET A PRE ENGAGEMENT IN EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN HILL TOMORROW THANK YOU BUT WILL NOT YOUR HORSE WANT REST REST HE HAS ONLY COME THREE AND TWENTY MILES TODAY ALL NONSENSE NOTHING RUINS HORSES SO MUCH AS REST NOTHING KNOCKS THEM UP SO SOON
JAMES ACCEPTED THIS TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE AND QUALIFIED HIS CONSCIENCE FOR ACCEPTING IT TOO BY SAYING WITH PERFECT SINCERITY INDEED CATHERINE I LOVE YOU DEARLY
YES SAID MORLAND WHO OVERHEARD THIS BUT YOU FORGET THAT YOUR HORSE WAS INCLUDED MY HORSE
HER TENDER BODY TOSSED FURIOUSLY ABOUT WITH THE SWAY OF THE VEHICLE
LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET FROM WHERE THE COACH WAS STANDING HE TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND WAS LOST AMONG THE ROCKS AHEAD FOUR HORSES COVERED WITH SWEAT WERE PANTING AND HEAVING AS IF IN GREAT DISTRESS AFTER THEIR MAD RUN
COVERING HIS PATCH CAREFULLY WITH HIS SLOUCHING HAT MY SERVANT SHE'S COLORED COLORED HE ASKED IN AMAZEMENT
SET OFF TO WALK TOGETHER TO MISTER ALLEN'S AND JAMES AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON THEM SAID WELL CATHERINE HOW DO YOU LIKE MY FRIEND THORPE INSTEAD OF ANSWERING AS SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE HAD THERE BEEN NO FRIENDSHIP AND NO FLATTERY IN THE CASE I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL
THAT HAD MINGLED WITH HIS DREAMS HE MOUNTED THE BANK AND LOOKED OVER THE FENCE ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM STOOD A SMALL HOMESTEAD HAVING A GARDEN AND PIG STIES ATTACHED IN FRONT OF IT BESIDE THE BROOK
SHALL I TELL IT TO YOU DO ARABELLA DONN I'M LIVING HERE I MUST HAVE KNOWN IT IF I HAD OFTEN COME THIS WAY BUT I MOSTLY GO STRAIGHT ALONG THE HIGH ROAD MY FATHER IS A PIG BREEDER
I HAVE ACQUIRED QUITE AN AVERAGE STUDENT'S POWER TO READ THE COMMON ANCIENT CLASSICS LATIN IN PARTICULAR
THE MASTER SAID LOVE MAKES A SPOT BEAUTIFUL WHO CHOOSES NOT TO DWELL IN LOVE HAS HE GOT WISDOM TWO THE MASTER SAID LOVELESS MEN CANNOT BEAR NEED LONG THEY CANNOT BEAR FORTUNE LONG
OR IN A POT OF WATER THAT IS BOILING OVER THE FIRE WHEN THE WHEY HAS RISEN SUFFICIENTLY POUR IT THROUGH A COLANDER AND PUT THE CURD OR CHEESE AWAY IN A COLD PLACE AND JUST BEFORE GOING TO TABLE SEASON IT WITH SALT AND PEPPER TO YOUR TASTE AND POUR SOME SWEET CREAM OVER IT
AND JUST COME TO A BOIL STIR IT AND DO NOT LET IT BOIL OVER LET IT KEEP AT BOILING HEAT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES THEN TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE AND PUT IN HALF A TEA CUP OF WATER TO SETTLE IT LET IT STAND FIVE MINUTES AND POUR IT OFF

PUT MORE ON IN TWO DAYS KEEP IT IN A COLD PLACE IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS IT WILL DO TO STRETCH ON STICKS HANG IT UP IN A DRY COOL PLACE WITH AS MUCH SALT AS WILL STICK TO IT WHEN QUITE DRY PUT IT IN A PAPER BAG AND HANG IT UP
AT THIS MEMORABLE DATE OF HIS LIFE HE WAS ONE SATURDAY RETURNING FROM ALFREDSTON TO MARYGREEN ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT WAS FINE WARM AND SOFT SUMMER WEATHER AND HE WALKED WITH HIS TOOLS AT HIS BACK
AN ADROIT LITTLE SUCK TO THE INTERIOR OF EACH OF HER CHEEKS IN SUCCESSION
WHOEVER DID IT WAS WASTEFUL OF OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY OH THAT'S NOTHING BUT YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ME I SUPPOSE OH YES IF YOU LIKE TO
IT HAD ALL COME OF READING HEATHEN WORKS EXCLUSIVELY THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE CONVINCED HE WAS OF HIS INCONSISTENCY HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE COULD BE READING QUITE THE RIGHT BOOKS FOR HIS OBJECT IN LIFE
PERSONS WITH WEAK NERVES SHOULD NEVER DRINK STRONG TEA AND COFFEE I HAVE KNOWN INSTANCES OF PERSONS BEING AFFLICTED WITH VIOLENT ATTACKS OF NERVOUS HEAD ACHE
AND JUDE WAS LOST TO ALL CONDITIONS OF THINGS IN THE ADVENT OF A FRESH AND WILD PLEASURE THAT OF HAVING FOUND A NEW CHANNEL FOR EMOTIONAL INTEREST HITHERTO UNSUSPECTED THOUGH IT HAD LAIN CLOSE BESIDE HIM
MEDIAEVAL ART IN ANY MATERIAL WAS A TRADE FOR WHICH HE HAD RATHER A FANCY HE COULD NOT GO FAR WRONG IN FOLLOWING HIS UNCLE'S FOOTSTEPS AND ENGAGING HIMSELF AWHILE WITH THE CARCASES THAT CONTAINED THE SCHOLAR SOULS
AS ANOTHER OUTCOME OF THIS CHANGE OF GROOVE HE VISITED ON SUNDAYS ALL THE CHURCHES WITHIN A WALK AND DECIPHERED THE LATIN INSCRIPTIONS ON FIFTEENTH CENTURY BRASSES AND TOMBS ON ONE OF THESE PILGRIMAGES
THE MASTER SAID A MAN AND HIS FAULTS ARE OF A PIECE BY WATCHING HIS FAULTS WE LEARN WHETHER LOVE BE HIS EIGHT THE MASTER SAID
IF YOU HAVE A LARGE FAMILY BY USING SEVERAL PANS SIX POUNDS OF COFFEE CAN THUS BE ROASTED AND BUT LITTLE TIME SPENT ON IT BOILING COFFEE A LARGE TEA CUPFUL OF UNGROUND COFFEE WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR SIX PERSONS
ON A DAY WHEN FAWLEY WAS GETTING QUITE ADVANCED BEING NOW ABOUT SIXTEEN
INSTEAD OF BY HAILING HIM BUT SHE SLYLY LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
TWENTY SIX
TILL HE PRENTICED HIMSELF AT ALFREDSTON SINCE THEN HE'S BEEN VERY STUCK UP AND ALWAYS READING HE WANTS TO BE A SCHOLAR THEY SAY OH I DON'T CARE WHAT HE IS OR ANYTHING ABOUT N DON'T YOU THINK IT MY CHILD OH DON'T YE
IT IS BEST TO HAVE ONE KETTLE OR BASKET TO PUT THE BUTTER IN THAT IS USED AT THE TABLE IT SHOULD BE DEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD FIVE OR SIX PLATES EACH COVERED WITH A SAUCER IT CAN BE KEPT IN THIS WAY AS FIRM AND SWEET AS IN AN ICE HOUSE
CATCHED UN MY DEAR LACONICALLY ASKED THE GIRL CALLED ANNY I DON'T KNOW I WISH I HAD THROWN SOMETHING ELSE THAN THAT REGRETFULLY MURMURED ARABELLA LORD HE'S NOBODY THOUGH YOU MED THINK SO
BUTTER CHEESE COFFEE TEA
TILL MOVED BY AMATORY CURIOSITY SHE TURNED HER EYES CRITICALLY UPON HIM YOU DON'T THINK I WOULD SHY THINGS AT YOU OH NO
AND THOUGHT HE MIGHT BECOME EVEN A BISHOP BY LEADING A PURE ENERGETIC WISE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE WOULD SET
MAY HAVE HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BECOMING A SCHOLAR BY THESE ROUGH AND READY MEANS HE WAS IN THE WAY OF GETTING INTO THE GROOVE HE WISHED TO FOLLOW WHILE HE WAS BUSIED WITH THESE ANCIENT PAGES WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN THUMBED BY HANDS POSSIBLY IN THE GRAVE
ONE GOOD WORKING ANSWERS VERY WELL FOR BUTTER IN WINTER ALWAYS SCALD THE CHURN BEFORE YOU PUT IN THE CREAM IN COLD WEATHER TO PUT UP BUTTER FOR WINTER WORK IT WELL AND SALT IT RATHER MORE THAN FOR TABLE USE
ONCE THERE I SHALL SO ADVANCE WITH THE ASSISTANCE I SHALL THERE GET THAT MY PRESENT KNOWLEDGE WILL APPEAR TO ME BUT AS CHILDISH IGNORANCE I MUST SAVE MONEY AND I WILL AND ONE OF THOSE COLLEGES SHALL OPEN ITS DOORS TO ME
JUDE FAWLEY SHOULDERED HIS TOOL BASKET AND RESUMED HIS LONELY WAY FILLED WITH AN ARDOUR AT WHICH HE MENTALLY STOOD AT GAZE HE HAD JUST INHALED A SINGLE BREATH FROM A NEW ATMOSPHERE WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN HANGING ROUND HIM EVERYWHERE HE WENT
HE WAS FREQUENTLY MET IN THE LANES BY PEDESTRIANS AND OTHERS WITHOUT HIS SEEING THEM AND BY DEGREES THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HIS METHOD OF COMBINING WORK AND PLAY SUCH THEY CONSIDERED HIS READING TO BE WHICH
OR HATE OTHERS FOUR THE MASTER SAID
TWENTY SEVEN
SHE WAS NOW SEEN BY MANY YOUNG MEN WHO HAD NOT BEEN NEAR HER BEFORE NOT ONE HOWEVER STARTED WITH RAPTUROUS WONDER ON BEHOLDING HER NO WHISPER OF EAGER INQUIRY RAN ROUND THE ROOM
AND DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE FLOWERS AND GROW BEST WHERE THEY ARE SHELTERED BY THE WOODS IF YOU HAD PLANTED THEM AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AS I WISHED YOU TO THE WIND WOULD NOT HAVE KILLED THEM MARY DID NOT REPLY TO THIS
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW PLEASED AND HAPPY THE SIGHT OF THE PRETTY LITTLE SHIP MADE THEM AND SOON AFTER WHEN MARY HAD BEEN HUGGED BY HER TWO SUNBURNED BROTHERS AND WAS CLASPED IN HER FATHER'S STRONG ARMS SHE WHISPERED
NOR ONE LUCKY OVERTURN TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THE HERO NOTHING MORE ALARMING OCCURRED THAN A FEAR ON MISSUS ALLEN'S SIDE OF HAVING ONCE LEFT HER CLOGS BEHIND HER AT AN INN
AND BY THE PATH THAT RUNS BESIDE THE WOOD SO HE GAVE THE REIN TO HIS MARE AND THEY RODE ALONG CHATTING MERRILY TOGETHER TILL THEY CAME TO THE WOOD THEN SAID THE SQUIRE TAKE A LOOK WITHIN THAT NOOK AND TELL ME WHAT IS THERE
THEIR NAMES WERE HOBART AND ROBART THE LITTLE GIRL'S NAME WAS MARY AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY INDEED WHEN HER FATHER AND HER BROTHERS WERE AT HOME FOR THEY PETTED HER AND PLAYED GAMES WITH HER AND LOVED HER VERY DEARLY
STROKING HER CURLS TENDERLY AS HE SPOKE WELL WELL MY DARLING IT WILL BE A LONG TIME INDEED DO YOU KNOW THE COWSLIPS THAT GROW IN THE PASTURES MARY OH YES I WATCH FOR THEM EVERY SPRING SHE ANSWERED
THE WEATHER NOW BEGAN TO CHANGE AND THE COLD SEA WINDS BLEW EACH NIGHT OVER MARY'S GARDEN SHE DID NOT KNOW THIS FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS LYING SNUGLY TUCKED UP IN HER BED
BUT TELL ME PAPA WHAT HAVE THE FLOWERS TO DO WITH YOUR COMING HOME WHY JUST THIS SWEETHEART RETURNED THE SAILOR GRAVELY ALL THE TIME THAT IT TAKES THE COWSLIPS AND DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS TO SPROUT FROM THE GROUND
IN WHICH DWELT A SAILOR AND HIS WIFE WITH THEIR TWO STRONG SONS AND A LITTLE GIRL THE SONS WERE ALSO SAILORS AND HAD MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES WITH THEIR FATHER IN A PRETTY SHIP CALLED THE SKYLARK
AND NOW AS THE DAYS PASSED BY MARY WATERED AND TENDED HER GARDEN WITH GREAT CARE AND WHEN THE FLOWERS BEGAN TO SPROUT SHE PLUCKED ALL THE WEEDS THAT GREW AMONG THEM AND SO IN THE MILD SPRING WEATHER THE PLANTS GREW FINELY
SHE WAS FILLED WITH JOY WHEN ONE MORNING SHE RAN OUT TO HER FLOWER GARDEN AFTER BREAKFAST AND FOUND THE DINGLE BELLS AND COWSLIPS WERE ACTUALLY BLOSSOMING WHILE EVEN THE COCKLE SHELLS WERE SHOWING THEIR WHITE BUDS
THEN GOD WILLING WE SHALL COME BACK TO YOU AND BY THAT TIME YOU MAY HAVE GROWN WISER AND BIGGER AND I AM SURE YOU WILL HAVE GROWN OLDER SO ONE MORE KISS SWEETHEART AND THEN WE MUST GO FOR OUR TIME IS UP
AND IN THE END SHE PLANTED THE DINGLE BELLS ALL IN ONE STRAIGHT ROW AND THE COCKLE SHELLS IN ANOTHER STRAIGHT ROW THE LENGTH OF THE BED AND SHE FINISHED BY PLANTING THE COWSLIPS IN ANOTHER LONG ROW AT THE BACK HER MOTHER SMILED BUT SAID NOTHING
I HAVE BEEN SAYING HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF THE SKINNERS WERE HERE THIS WINTER INSTEAD OF LAST OR IF THE PARRYS HAD COME AS THEY TALKED OF ONCE SHE MIGHT HAVE DANCED WITH GEORGE PARRY I AM SO SORRY SHE HAS NOT HAD A PARTNER
HER FATHER INSTEAD OF GIVING HER AN UNLIMITED ORDER ON HIS BANKER OR EVEN PUTTING AN HUNDRED POUNDS BANK BILL INTO HER HANDS GAVE HER ONLY TEN GUINEAS AND PROMISED HER MORE WHEN SHE WANTED IT
AND THAT FORTUNATELY PROVED TO BE GROUNDLESS THEY ARRIVED AT BATH CATHERINE WAS ALL EAGER DELIGHT HER EYES WERE HERE THERE EVERYWHERE AS THEY APPROACHED ITS FINE AND STRIKING ENVIRONS
AND SAW A LITTLE SPECK UPON THE WATERS THAT LOOKED LIKE A SAIL AND WHEN IT CAME NEARER AND HAD GROWN LARGER BOTH SHE AND HER MOTHER SAW THAT IT WAS THE SKYLARK COME HOME AGAIN
AT WHICH A LARGE PARTY WERE ALREADY PLACED WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO DO THERE OR ANYBODY TO SPEAK TO EXCEPT EACH OTHER MISSUS ALLEN CONGRATULATED HERSELF AS SOON AS THEY WERE SEATED
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR FIFTEEN SONNETS IN CELEBRATION OF HER CHARMS AND WENT TO HER CHAIR IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH EVERYBODY
AND DROWN HER IN TEARS FOR THE LAST DAY OR TWO OF THEIR BEING TOGETHER AND ADVICE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND APPLICABLE NATURE MUST OF COURSE FLOW FROM HER WISE LIPS IN THEIR PARTING CONFERENCE IN HER CLOSET
SQUIRE TOOK HER TOWARD THE LITTLE BROOK THAT WANDERED THROUGH THE MEADOWS FLOWING OVER THE PEBBLES WITH A SOFT GURGLING SOUND THAT WAS VERY NEARLY AS SWEET AS MUSIC AND WHEN THEY REACHED IT THE BIG SQUIRE SAID IF YOU WILL LOOK BESIDE THE BROOK
WE SHALL DO BETTER ANOTHER EVENING I HOPE WAS MISTER ALLEN'S CONSOLATION THE COMPANY BEGAN TO DISPERSE WHEN THE DANCING WAS OVER ENOUGH TO LEAVE SPACE FOR THE REMAINDER TO WALK ABOUT IN SOME COMFORT
WITHOUT CONCEIT OR AFFECTATION OF ANY KIND HER MANNERS JUST REMOVED FROM THE AWKWARDNESS AND SHYNESS OF A GIRL HER PERSON PLEASING AND WHEN IN GOOD LOOKS PRETTY
AND THEN HE CONTINUED T IS APTLY SAID BUT PRITHEE MAID WHY THUS YOUR GARDEN FILL WHEN EV'RY FIELD THE SAME FLOWERS YIELD TO PLUCK THEM AS YOU WILL THAT IS A LONG STORY SQUIRE
I VERY MUCH SUSPECT THE REAL REASON THEY ARE DYING IS BECAUSE THE COLD SEA WIND CAUGHT THEM LAST NIGHT DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE IF YOU HAD SCATTERED THE COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ABOUT THEM THE STRONGER PLANTS WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THE WEAKER BUT YOU SEE MY GIRL
I WISH YOU COULD DANCE MY DEAR I WISH YOU COULD GET A PARTNER FOR SOME TIME HER YOUNG FRIEND FELT OBLIGED TO HER FOR THESE WISHES BUT THEY WERE REPEATED SO OFTEN
AND WHILE HE WAS AWAY THE DOCTOR AND THE REST OF THE ANIMALS
I HAVE SAID ENOUGH
THAT FOR A LITTLE THEY COVERED THE WHOLE MOON SO IT COULD NOT SHINE AND THE SEA GREW DARK AND BLACK LIKE WHEN A STORM CLOUD PASSES OVER THE SUN
SPREAD THICK WELL THAT NIGHT PRINCE BUMPO CAME SECRETLY TO THE DOCTOR IN PRISON AND SAID TO HIM WHITE MAN I AM AN UNHAPPY PRINCE YEARS AGO
HE NEEDED IT TO SHAVE WITH THEN THE PRINCE TAKING A BUNCH OF COPPER KEYS FROM HIS POCKET UNDID THE GREAT DOUBLE LOCKS AND THE DOCTOR WITH ALL HIS ANIMALS
THEY SEEMED TO HAVE DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER INDEED THEY HAD LOST THEIR WAY VERY BADLY THEY HAD STRAYED A LONG WAY OFF THE PATH AND THE JUNGLE
THEN THEY USED TO MAKE THE PEOPLE THEY HAD CAUGHT WRITE HOME TO THEIR FRIENDS FOR MONEY AND IF THE FRIENDS SENT NO MONEY THE PIRATES OFTEN THREW THE PEOPLE INTO THE SEA
WERE NEARLY ALWAYS SORRY FOR IT AFTERWARDS PRESENTLY SHE SPIED CHEE CHEE SWINGING THROUGH THE TREES STILL LOOKING FOR THE DOCTOR WHEN CHEE CHEE SAW HER HE CAME INTO HER TREE
GOT LOST IN THE DEEP WOODS THEY WANDERED AROUND AND AROUND BUT COULD NOT FIND THEIR WAY DOWN TO THE SEASHORE CHEE CHEE WHEN HE COULD NOT SEE THEM ANYWHERE WAS TERRIBLY UPSET
BUT WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE SO I CAME BACK FULL OF SADNESS TO MY FATHER'S KINGDOM
THEY ALL LOOKED UP AND THERE STREAMING ACROSS THE FACE OF THE MOON
WAS SO THICK WITH BUSHES AND CREEPERS AND VINES THAT SOMETIMES THEY COULD HARDLY MOVE AT ALL AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO TAKE OUT HIS POCKET KNIFE AND CUT HIS WAY ALONG
WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT NOW COME OVER HERE BY THE LIGHT OH BUT BEFORE I DO ANYTHING YOU MUST FIRST GO DOWN TO THE BEACH AND GET A SHIP READY WITH FOOD IN IT TO TAKE ME ACROSS THE SEA
BUT IT ISN'T SO EASY TO TURN A BLACK MAN WHITE YOU SPEAK AS THOUGH HE WERE A DRESS TO BE RE DYED IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE SHALL THE LEOPARD CHANGE HIS SPOTS OR THE ETHIOPIAN HIS SKIN
BUT EVEN WHILE HE WAS WONDERING THEY HEARD A STRANGE WHISPERING NOISE HIGH IN THE AIR COMING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE ANIMALS ALL STOPPED SAYING GOOD BY AND LISTENED
THE NOISE GREW LOUDER AND BIGGER IT SEEMED TO BE COMING NEARER TO THEM A SOUND LIKE THE AUTUMN WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE LEAVES OF A POPLAR TREE OR A GREAT
AND THERE TIED TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP WERE A THOUSAND STRINGS AND TWO THOUSAND SWALLOWS WERE PULLING ON EACH STRING ALL TERRIBLY SWIFT FLIERS
BY THE EDGE OF THE RIVER THEY STOPPED AND SAID FAREWELL THIS TOOK A LONG TIME BECAUSE ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF MONKEYS WANTED TO SHAKE JOHN DOLITTLE BY THE HAND
THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF GETTING OUT THEN GUB GUB BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN ALL THIS TIME POLYNESIA WAS STILL SITTING IN THE TREE IN THE PALACE GARDEN
AND BLUNDERED INTO THE PALACE GARDEN BY MISTAKE BUT COULDN'T YOU GUIDE THEM ASKED CHEE CHEE AND HE BEGAN TO SCOLD THE PARROT FOR LETTING THEM GET LOST WHILE HE WAS AWAY LOOKING FOR THE COCOANUTS
JIP AND THE OWL TOO TOO WENT ON TO THE SHIP WITH THE DOCTOR BUT CHEE CHEE POLYNESIA AND THE CROCODILE STAYED BEHIND BECAUSE AFRICA WAS THEIR PROPER HOME
CAN'T BLAME HER FOR GETTING SCARED I WONDER WHO HE'LL GO AND KISS THIS TIME SILLY BUSINESS THEN THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE WHITE MOUSE GUB GUB DAB DAB
AND WHO KNOWS HE MAY STAY WHITE AFTER ALL THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WOULD NEVER HAVE HIM EVEN IF HE DID SAID DAB DAB HE LOOKED BETTER THE WAY HE WAS I THOUGHT BUT HE'D NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT UGLY
MOST LIKELY HE WILL BE AS BLACK AS EVER WHEN HE WAKES UP IN THE MORNING THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I DIDN'T LIKE TO LEAVE THE MIRROR WITH HIM BUT THEN AGAIN HE MIGHT STAY WHITE I HAD NEVER USED THAT MIXTURE BEFORE
LOOKING AT ALL THE BOTTLES HE HAD USED FOR THE MIXTURE AND READING THE LABELS ON THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN A STRONG SMELL FILLED THE PRISON LIKE THE SMELL OF BROWN PAPER BURNING AT LAST
HE CLIMBED HIGH TREES AND LOOKED OUT FROM THE TOP BRANCHES TO TRY AND SEE THE DOCTOR'S HIGH HAT HE WAVED AND SHOUTED HE CALLED TO ALL THE ANIMALS BY NAME BUT IT WAS NO USE
I HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAD BEEN IN AFRICA SO LONG IT WILL BE NEARLY SUMMER WHEN WE GET HOME FOR THESE ARE THE SWALLOWS GOING BACK SWALLOWS I THANK YOU FOR WAITING FOR US
CATCHING HIM AND BRINGING HIM BACK THAT I TURNED TO THE LEFT INSTEAD OF THE RIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE SWAMP SH LOOK THERE'S PRINCE BUMPO COMING INTO THE GARDEN HE MUST NOT SEE US
YOU FELLOWS GOT AWAY WITH THEM AS EASY AS NOTHING I DON'T RECKON THE JULERY PEOPLE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN ROBBED YET
I RECKON THEY'VE FORGOT HIS REAL NAME LONG BEFORE THIS HE'S TWENTY SEVEN NOW AND HAS HAD IT EVER SINCE THE FIRST TIME HE EVER WENT IN SWIMMING
AND SETS THERE AND LOOKS AWAY OFF ON THE BIG MISSISSIPPI DOWN THERE A REACHING MILES AND MILES AROUND THE POINTS WHERE THE TIMBER LOOKS SMOKY AND DIM IT'S SO FAR OFF AND STILL AND EVERYTHING'S SO SOLEMN IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY YOU'VE LOVED IS DEAD AND GONE
WELL I GOT MY BOOTS ON AND WE WENT DOWN AND SLIPPED IN AND LAID THE PAPER OF SUGAR ON THE BERTH AND SAT DOWN SOFT AND SHEEPISH AND WENT TO LISTENING TO BUD DIXON SNORE HAL CLAYTON DROPPED OFF PRETTY SOON BUT I DIDN'T
IF I WAS TO SLIP ASHORE WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING ME THEY WOULD KNOW IT INSIDE OF AN HOUR SO THEN HE GOT TO WANDERING ALONG AND PRETTY SOON SURE ENOUGH HE WAS TELLING HE WAS POKING ALONG THROUGH HIS UPS AND DOWNS AND
YOU LOOK AT THIS BOOT HEEL NOW SEE IT'S BOTTOMED WITH A STEEL PLATE AND THE PLATE IS FASTENED ON WITH LITTLE SCREWS NOW THERE WASN'T A SCREW ABOUT THAT FELLER ANYWHERE BUT IN HIS BOOT HEELS SO IF HE NEEDED A SCREWDRIVER I RECKONED I KNOWED WHY
STRANGE AS THE INCIDENTS OF THIS STORY ARE THEY ARE NOT INVENTIONS BUT FACTS EVEN TO THE PUBLIC CONFESSION OF THE ACCUSED
THINK OF THE SMARTNESS AND COOLNESS OF THAT BLATHERSKITE HE PUT UP THAT SCHEME ON US AND REASONED OUT WHAT WE WOULD DO AND WE WENT AHEAD AND DONE IT PERFECTLY EXACT LIKE A COUPLE OF PUDD'NHEADS
HE GOT TO ROBBING WHEN HE WAS NINETEEN OR TWENTY AND THEY JAILED HIM BUT HE BROKE JAIL AND GOT AWAY UP NORTH HERE SOMERS THEY USED TO HEAR ABOUT HIM ROBBING AND BURGLARING NOW AND THEN BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE'S DEAD NOW AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
THEN WE WAITED TEN MORE FOR HER TO GET COOLED DOWN AND SWEET AND GENTLE AGAIN FOR TOM SAID IT TOOK HER TEN MINUTES TO UNRUFFLE IN TIMES WHEN HALF OF HER FEATHERS WAS UP BUT TWENTY WHEN THEY WAS ALL UP AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE TIMES WHEN
I REACHED AND GOT THE PAPER AND THEN WE STOOD UP AND WAITED PERFECTLY STILL BUD NEVER STIRRED I TURNED THE KEY OF THE OUTSIDE DOOR VERY SOFT AND SLOW THEN TURNED THE KNOB THE SAME WAY AND WE WENT TIPTOEING OUT ONTO THE GUARD
THEM WAS THE THINGS THAT WENT BACK TO THE SHOP WHEN WE SAID THE WATER WASN'T QUITE FINE ENOUGH FOR TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TOM SAYS WAS THEY REALLY WORTH ALL THAT MONEY DO YOU RECKON EVERY CENT OF IT AND
AND TOLD HIM NOT TO EVER LET EITHER OF US HAVE IT AGAIN WITHOUT THE OTHERS WAS ON HAND TO SEE IT DONE THEN WE WENT DOWN TOWN EACH BY HIS OWN SELF BECAUSE I RECKON MAYBE WE ALL HAD THE SAME NOTION I DON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN BUT I RECKON MAYBE WE HAD
OR GET KILLED TRYING IT MADE ME SHIVER BECAUSE I AIN'T AS BRAVE AS SOME PEOPLE BUT IF I SHOWED THE WHITE FEATHER WELL I KNOWED BETTER THAN DO THAT I KIND OF HOPED THE BOAT WOULD LAND SOMERS AND WE COULD SKIP ASHORE AND NOT HAVE TO RUN THE RISK OF THIS ROW
AND LAND BUT I FELT GAY AND GOOD YOU SEE I HAD HAD MY BOOTS OFF TO UNSWELL MY FEET AND JUST THEN I TOOK UP ONE OF THEM TO PUT IT ON AND I CATCHED A GLIMPSE OF THE HEEL BOTTOM AND IT JUST TOOK MY BREATH AWAY
AT LAST BUD DIXON HE DROPPED OFF AS SOON AS HE WAS SNORING A GOOD REGULAR GAIT THAT WAS LIKELY TO LAST AND HAD HIS CHIN ON HIS BREAST AND LOOKED PERMANENT HAL CLAYTON NODDED TOWARDS THE DI'MONDS AND THEN TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE DOOR AND I UNDERSTOOD
WHAT NOTION TOM SAYS TO ROB THE OTHERS WHAT ONE TAKE EVERYTHING AFTER ALL OF YOU HAD HELPED TO GET IT CERT'NLY IT DISGUSTED TOM SAWYER AND HE SAID IT WAS THE ORNERIEST LOW DOWNEST THING HE EVER HEARD OF
WHY SHE'D BEGIN TO DOUBT RIGHT AWAY AND IMAGINE A LOT OF SICKNESSES AND DANGERS AND OBJECTIONS AND FIRST YOU KNOW SHE'D TAKE IT ALL BACK YOU LEMME ALONE I RECKON I KNOW HOW TO WORK HER NOW I NEVER WOULD A THOUGHT OF THAT BUT HE WAS RIGHT
THE WAY IT COME ABOUT WAS THIS HE GOT TO ASKING US KIND OF INDIFFERENT LIKE ABOUT THE PASSENGERS DOWN ON DECK WE TOLD HIM ABOUT THEM BUT HE WARN'T SATISFIED WE WARN'T PARTICULAR ENOUGH HE TOLD US TO DESCRIBE THEM BETTER TOM DONE IT AT LAST
MUCH OF THAT THEY'LL GET OUT OF YOU AND HUCK FINN I RECKON THERE'S A NEIGHBOR NAMED BRACE DUNLAP THAT'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY THEIR BENNY FOR THREE MONTHS AND AT LAST THEY TOLD HIM POINT BLANK AND ONCE FOR ALL HE COULDN'T SO HE HAS SOURED ON THEM
HIM TRYING TO CURRY FAVOR THAT WAY SO HARD PUSHED AND POOR AND YET HIRING THAT USELESS JUBITER DUNLAP TO PLEASE HIS ORNERY BROTHER WHAT A NAME JUBITER WHERE'D HE GET
THEY DON'T HEAR ABOUT HIM ANY MORE WHAT WAS HIS NAME JAKE
AS HE SAID HIS AUNT POLLY WOULDN'T LET HIM QUIT SCHOOL AND GO TRAIPSING OFF SOMERS WASTING TIME SO WE WAS PRETTY BLUE
HE GIVE THAT SHIVER AGAIN AND SAYS THAT'S HIM THAT'S THE OTHER ONE
AND WAS NEARLY THE COLOR OF THE CARPET IT WAS A LITTLE ROUND PLUG ABOUT AS THICK AS THE END OF YOUR LITTLE FINGER AND I SAYS TO MYSELF THERE'S A DI'MOND IN THE NEST YOU'VE COME FROM BEFORE LONG I SPIED OUT THE PLUG'S MATE
AND WHEN I WAS PASSING A SHOP WHERE THEY SELL ALL SORTS OF THINGS I GOT A GLIMPSE OF ONE OF MY PALS THROUGH THE WINDOW IT WAS BUD DIXON I WAS GLAD YOU BET I SAYS TO MYSELF I'LL SEE WHAT HE BUYS SO I KEPT SHADY AND WATCHED
SEE HOW FAR OFF SUMMER IS YES AND IT SETS HIM TO SIGHING AND SADDENING AROUND AND THERE'S SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH HIM
WHEN TOM WAS DESCRIBING ONE OF THE ROUGHEST AND RAGGEDEST ONES HE GAVE A SHIVER AND A GASP AND SAYS
AND HE'S JUBITER YET HE'S TALL AND LAZY AND SLY AND SNEAKY AND RUTHER COWARDLY TOO BUT KIND OF GOOD NATURED AND WEARS LONG BROWN HAIR AND NO BEARD AND HASN'T GOT A CENT AND BRACE BOARDS HIM FOR NOTHING
AND SET DOWN ON THE END OF THE SKY LIGHT BOTH OF US KNOWED WHAT THAT MEANT WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO ONE ANOTHER BUD DIXON WOULD WAKE UP AND MISS THE SWAG AND WOULD COME STRAIGHT FOR US FOR HE AIN'T AFEARD OF ANYTHING OR ANYBODY THAT MAN AIN'T HE WOULD COME AND WE WOULD HEAVE HIM OVERBOARD
THE THOUGHT OF SUICIDE IS A GREAT CONSOLATION BY MEANS OF IT ONE GETS SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH MANY A BAD NIGHT
TO REJOICE ON ACCOUNT OF PRAISE IS IN MANY CASES MERELY POLITENESS OF HEART AND THE VERY OPPOSITE OF VANITY OF SPIRIT
ADVICE AS A RIDDLE IF THE BAND IS NOT TO BREAK BITE IT FIRST SECURE TO MAKE
YOU WANT TO PREPOSSESS HIM IN YOUR FAVOUR THEN YOU MUST BE EMBARRASSED BEFORE HIM
IT IS INHUMAN TO BLESS WHEN ONE IS BEING CURSED
OFTEN SHY ON MEAL TICKETS BUT STRONG ON TECHNIQUE AND THE PRICE OF TRIPE SANDWICHES AN ARTIST MAY BE A BARBER A BOOT BLACK A SARGENT OR A PADEREWSKI
OUR VANITY WOULD LIKE WHAT WE DO BEST TO PASS PRECISELY FOR WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT TO US CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF MANY SYSTEMS OF MORALS
IF ONE HAS FAILED TO SEE THE HAND THAT KILLS WITH LENIENCY SEVENTY IF A MAN HAS CHARACTER HE HAS ALSO HIS TYPICAL EXPERIENCE WHICH ALWAYS RECURS SEVENTY ONE
NINETY EIGHT WHEN ONE TRAINS ONE'S CONSCIENCE IT KISSES ONE WHILE IT BITES NINETY NINE THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS I LISTENED FOR THE ECHO
TWO MEN WITH THE SAME PRINCIPLES PROBABLY SEEK FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ENDS THEREWITH SEVENTY EIGHT HE WHO DESPISES HIMSELF NEVERTHELESS ESTEEMS HIMSELF THEREBY AS A DESPISER
ONE IS PUNISHED BEST FOR ONE'S VIRTUES
ONE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE FOLLIES OF CLEVER MEN WHAT A FORFEITURE OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN
A FOOL MAY GIVE A WISE MAN COUNSEL PREFACE IN THIS AGE OF THE ARDUOUS PURSUIT OF PEACE PROSPERITY AND PLEASURE
I DISLIKE HIM
ABSINTHE FROM TWO LATIN WORDS AD AND SINISTRUM MEANING TO THE BAD IF IN DOUBT TRY ONE OLD ADAGE ABSINTHE MAKES THE JAG LAST LONGER
IT IS A CURIOUS THING THAT GOD LEARNED GREEK WHEN HE WISHED TO TURN AUTHOR AND THAT HE DID NOT LEARN IT BETTER
TO HIM WHO FEELS HIMSELF PREORDAINED TO CONTEMPLATION AND NOT TO BELIEF ALL BELIEVERS ARE TOO NOISY AND OBTRUSIVE HE GUARDS AGAINST THEM
ONE MUST REPAY GOOD AND ILL BUT WHY JUST TO THE PERSON WHO DID US GOOD OR ILL
YES AND THEN TO GET ROUND THEM
AND I HEARD ONLY PRAISE ONE HUNDRED WE ALL FEIGN TO OURSELVES THAT WE ARE SIMPLER THAN WE ARE WE THUS RELAX OURSELVES AWAY FROM OUR FELLOWS
THE VANITY OF OTHERS IS ONLY COUNTER TO OUR TASTE WHEN IT IS COUNTER TO OUR VANITY
IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THEN THAT THESE PATHS DO NOT LEAD TO HAPPINESS THEY CANNOT GUIDE ANYONE TO THE PROMISED GOAL NOW I WILL VERY BRIEFLY SHOW WHAT SERIOUS EVILS ARE INVOLVED IN FOLLOWING THEM JUST CONSIDER
MANY A PEACOCK HIDES HIS TAIL FROM EVERY EYE AND CALLS IT HIS PRIDE SEVENTY FOUR A MAN OF GENIUS IS UNBEARABLE
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO POSSESS A TALENT ONE MUST ALSO HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO POSSESS IT
THE MORE ABSTRACT THE TRUTH YOU WISH TO TEACH THE MORE MUST YOU ALLURE THE SENSES TO IT
A NATION IS A DETOUR OF NATURE
TO TALK MUCH ABOUT ONESELF MAY ALSO BE A MEANS OF CONCEALING ONESELF
WHAT IS DONE OUT OF LOVE ALWAYS TAKES PLACE BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL
ONE OCCASIONALLY EMBRACES SOME ONE OR OTHER OUT OF LOVE TO MANKIND BECAUSE ONE CANNOT EMBRACE ALL BUT THIS IS WHAT ONE MUST NEVER CONFESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL
A TARDY SENSE OF PRUDENCE THAT PROMPTS ONE TO TRY TO SHUT HIS MOUTH ABOUT THE TIME HE HAS PUT HIS FOOT IN IT AGE SOMETHING TO BRAG ABOUT IN YOUR WINE CELLAR AND FORGET IN A BIRTH DAY BOOK
NINETY ONE SO COLD SO ICY THAT ONE BURNS ONE'S FINGER AT THE TOUCH OF HIM EVERY HAND THAT LAYS HOLD OF HIM SHRINKS BACK AND FOR THAT VERY REASON MANY THINK HIM RED HOT

AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
A STRIP OF SAND SKIRTED BY WATER COVERED WITH LADY KILLERS IN SUMMER LIFE SAVERS IN WINTER
FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME

BARS THINGS FOUND IN HARBORS HOTELS FENCES PRISONS COURTS AND MUSIC
THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
HE STROLLED OVER AND HANDED BOBBY A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS WHERE'S ROBINSON BOBBY ASKED I SAW HIM IN THE COURT A WHILE AGO I DARESAY HE'S WANDERING AROUND PERHAPS WATCHING THE MEN AT THE GRAVE HE LEARNED NOTHING NEW LAST NIGHT I WAS WITH HIM AT BREAKFAST I GATHER NOT
HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
PRAECORDIA BOARD AN IMPLEMENT FOR ADMINISTERING CORPORAL PUNISHMENT USED BY MOTHERS AND LAND LADIES THE FESTIVE BOARD MAY BE A SHINGLE A HAIR BRUSH
HAVE I ANY RIGHT DON'T GRAHAM SAID I'LL BE WITH YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT
ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
BATHE AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST THEN WE CAN DECIDE THERE'S NO USE TALKING OF THE OTHER THING I'VE FORGOTTEN IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE YOU MUST BOBBY SPRANG UPRIGHT HOW CAN I FORGET IT
WHY HE SHOULD FAIL TO REFER TO BOBBY'S QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST OR TO THE OPENLY EXPRESSED ENMITY OF GRAHAM ONLY ONE THEORY PROMISED TO FIT AT ALL IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PANAMANIAN TO RETURN TO THE CEDARS
I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED
HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
BOBBY LOOKED UP ISN'T THAT AN AUTOMOBILE COMING THROUGH THE WOODS HE ASKED MAYBE RAWLINS BACK FROM SMITHTOWN OR THE MINISTER THE CAR STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT THEY HEARD THE REMOTE TINKLING OF THE FRONT DOOR BELL JENKINS PASSED THROUGH
A DESIRABLE QUALITY IN THE FOURTH OF JULY ORATION BUT NOT IN THE FIREWORKS BROKE A WORD EXPRESSING THE ULTIMATE CONDITION OF ONE WHO IS TOO MUCH BENT ON SPECULATING BUM A FALLEN TOUGH BUMP A TOUGH FALL BUNCO
WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
OVERCOAT I'VE NEARLY FROZEN DRIVING FROM SMITHTOWN BEFORE EITHER MAN COULD GROPE FOR A SUITABLE GREETING HE FACED BOBBY
I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
WHERE A MAN'S BODY MIGHT POSSIBLY LIE CONCEALED EVERY TRACT OF BUSH AND WOODLAND EVERY BARN AND OUT BUILDING EVERY HOLLOW AND DITCH EVERY FIELD AND FENCE CORNER WAS EXPLORED WITH CAREFUL MINUTENESS EVEN THE WELLS OF THE DISTRICT WERE PEERED INTO
FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY

AND WITH THAT WORD HE LAUGH'D FULL MERRILY
AND WANTONLY AGAIN WITH HIM SHE PLAY'D TILL AT THE LAST THIS MERCHANT TO HER SAID BY GOD QUOTH HE I AM A LITTLE WROTH
FOR WHICH FULL FAST HIS COUNTOUR DOOR HE SHET AND
AND PROVED TO BE A FLAT ON THE COAST WHICH WHEN DAY APPEARED I FOUND TO BE A DESERT ISLAND
WHY CERTAINLY NOT THERE IS NO DENYING IT CANST THOU THEN DOUBT THAT HE WHOM THOU SEEST TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE WILLED
WAS THY MIND NEVER TROUBLED IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME WRONG DONE TO THEE NAY SAID I
HOWEVER IT MADE ME IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS SOME LIVING CREATURE IN THIS PLACE FOR I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TORCHES CONTINUED THUS BURNING OF THEMSELVES SEVERAL OTHER RARITIES DETAINED MY CURIOSITY IN THIS ROOM
WHERE I BOUGHT A SHIP READY FITTED FOR SEA
BUT NOT BEFORE SHE HAD PERFECTLY INSTRUCTED ME IN ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY TO CONVINCE ME OF THE TRUTH OF THE MOOSULMAUN RELIGION AFTER HER DEATH I PERSISTED WITH CONSTANCY IN THE BELIEF OF ITS DIVINITY
I SOON DRIED MY CLOTHES IN THE SUN AND AS I WALKED ALONG I FOUND SEVERAL KINDS OF FRUIT AND LIKEWISE FRESH WATER WHICH GAVE ME SOME HOPES OF PRESERVING MY LIFE I HAD JUST LAID MYSELF DOWN TO REST IN A SHADE
HEAR ME O LORD AND GRANT MY REQUEST THE YOUNG MAN TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS ME AND SAID MY GOOD LADY PRAY LET ME KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS DESOLATE CITY
WHILE THE BAD ARE LEFT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH
THE OTHER ATTAIN IT NOT IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT THE GOOD ARE ENDUED WITH POWER WHILE THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE WEAK IF ANY DOUBT IT HE IS INCAPABLE OF REFLECTING ON THE NATURE OF THINGS OR THE CONSEQUENCES INVOLVED IN REASONING
FOR IF THIS EVER GAPING EVER CRAVING WANT IS GLUTTED BY WEALTH IT NEEDS MUST BE THAT THE WANT ITSELF WHICH CAN BE SO GLUTTED STILL REMAINS I DO NOT SPEAK OF HOW VERY LITTLE SUFFICES FOR NATURE
THEN WE HAVE WORKED ROUND TO AN OPPOSITE CONCLUSION THE WEALTH WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO MAKE A MAN INDEPENDENT RATHER PUTS HIM IN NEED OF FURTHER PROTECTION HOW IN THE WORLD THEN
AND TO RESIGN MYSELF WHOLLY TO YOUR COMMANDS THE PRINCE REPLIED I KNOW NOT MADAM WHETHER YOU BE IN JEST OR NO BUT FOR MY PART I SERIOUSLY DECLARE BEFORE THESE LADIES YOUR SISTERS
WHICH I HIT UPON THE HEAD AND KILLED THE OTHER FINDING ITSELF AT LIBERTY TOOK WING AND FLEW AWAY I LOOKED AFTER IT FOR SOME TIME TILL IT DISAPPEARED I THEN SOUGHT ANOTHER SHADY SPOT FOR REPOSE AND FELL ASLEEP
I HAVE NOT ALTERED MY MIND WITH RESPECT TO YOU SINCE WE LAST PARTED COME AGAIN AND TAKE PART OF WHAT I HAVE UPON THIS I EMBRACED THEM AND WE LIVED TOGETHER AS BEFORE
AND THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT GRATIFYING MY CURIOSITY IN THE MEAN TIME NIGHT CAME ON WHICH REMINDED ME THAT IT WAS TIME TO RETIRE I PROPOSED TO RETURN THE WAY I HAD ENTERED BUT I COULD NOT FIND IT
AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH WE PERCEIVED A GREAT TOWN HAVING A FRESH GALE WE SOON REACHED THE HARBOUR AND CAST ANCHOR I HAD NOT PATIENCE TO WAIT TILL MY SISTERS WERE DRESSED TO GO ALONG WITH ME BUT WENT ASHORE ALONE IN THE BOAT
FOR FROM MY ADMISSIONS IT MUST NEEDS FOLLOW THAT THE GOOD HAVE POWER AND THE BAD ARE IMPOTENT THOU ANTICIPATEST RIGHTLY AND THAT AS PHYSICIANS RECKON IS A SIGN THAT NATURE IS SET WORKING
WHICH STOOD OPEN A CURTAIN OF SILK STUFF SEEMED TO BE DRAWN BEFORE IT A LAMP HUNG OVER THE ENTRANCE AFTER I HAD SURVEYED THE BUILDING I MADE NO DOUBT BUT IT WAS THE PALACE OF THE PRINCE WHO REIGNED OVER THAT COUNTRY
THE WISE ALONE ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD WHILE THE WICKED FOLLOW THEIR OWN HEARTS LUST BUT CAN NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY WOULD FOR THEY GO ON IN THEIR WILFULNESS
BRING WITH THEM ANYTHING OF SUCH SORT AS SEEMS TO HAVE NOTHING WANTING TO IT THAT IS GOOD WE TOO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME ARE MADE HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF THESE THINGS BUT IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FULFIL THEIR PROMISES AND MOREOVER
HE ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND WE CONVERSED THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT CONCERNING OUR EMBARKATION AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY WE LEFT THE PALACE
WHO CAN VENTURE TO DENY IT YET HE WOULD NOT UNLESS HE POSSESSED THE MONEY WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE NO HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT
TO HINDER ITS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE WHO POSSESS IT AGAINST THEIR WILL I ADMIT IT WHY OF COURSE WHEN EVERY DAY THE STRONGER WRESTS IT FROM THE WEAKER WITHOUT HIS CONSENT ELSE WHENCE COME LAWSUITS
AND MAY HE BE GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO PROTECT US IN THE SAME MANNER
CAN WANT BE DRIVEN AWAY BY RICHES CANNOT THE RICH FEEL HUNGER CANNOT THEY THIRST ARE NOT THE LIMBS OF THE WEALTHY SENSITIVE TO THE WINTER'S COLD BUT THOU WILT SAY
FOR SINCE GOOD AND EVIL ARE CONTRARIES IF IT IS MADE PLAIN THAT GOOD IS POWER THE FEEBLENESS OF EVIL IS CLEARLY SEEN AND CONVERSELY IF THE FRAIL NATURE OF EVIL IS MADE MANIFEST THE STRENGTH OF GOOD IS THEREBY KNOWN
YET IN SOME WISE NOTWITHSTANDING YE DISCERN THE TRUE END OF HAPPINESS AND SO THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS YOU THITHER TO THAT TRUE GOOD WHILE ERROR IN MANY FORMS LEADS YOU ASTRAY THEREFROM
WE CONTINUED THUS A WHOLE YEAR IN PERFECT LOVE AND HARMONY SEEING THAT GOD HAD INCREASED MY SMALL STOCK I PROJECTED A VOYAGE TO EMBARK SOME OF IT IN A COMMERCIAL SPECULATION TO THIS END
BUT SINCE I SEE THEE SO READY AT UNDERSTANDING I WILL HEAP PROOF ON PROOF LOOK HOW MANIFEST IS THE EXTREMITY OF VICIOUS MEN'S WEAKNESS THEY CANNOT EVEN REACH THAT GOAL TO WHICH THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS AND ALMOST CONSTRAINS THEM
AS SOON AS THESE TWO SISTERS RECEIVED THEIR PORTIONS THEY LEFT ME TO LIVE WITH THEIR MOTHER MY OTHER TWO SISTERS AND MYSELF STAYED WITH OUR MOTHER WHO WAS THEN ALIVE AND WHO WHEN SHE AFTERWARDS DIED
HERE THEN WE HAVE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ABYSS AND THE SHAMBLES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE INDUSTRIAL FABRIC A CONSTANT ELIMINATION IS GOING ON THE INEFFICIENT ARE WEEDED OUT AND FLUNG DOWNWARD VARIOUS THINGS CONSTITUTE INEFFICIENCY
AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW A GOOD WORKER MAY SUDDENLY BECOME INEFFICIENT AND WHAT THEN HAPPENS TO HIM I AM TEMPTED TO GIVE THE CASE OF M'GARRY A MAN THIRTY TWO YEARS OF AGE AND AN INMATE OF THE WORKHOUSE
CANNOT KEEP UP WITH ALL THE SHIFTING OF A CHANGING WORLD THERE IS ALWAYS A FRACTION OF A COMMUNITY AGITATING FOR SOMETHING NEW AND GRADUALLY FORCING THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT IT INTO LAW EVEN AGAINST THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY
A MINER MAY BELIEVE THAT THE CORPORATION FOR WHICH HE WORKS REALLY HAS NO RIGHT TO THE GOLD DOWN IN THE MINE AS HE IS DIGGING HE STRIKES A PARTICULARLY RICH POCKET OF HIGH GRADE ORE
BUT YOU MUSTN'T BLAME HIM POOR DEVIL HE CAN'T HELP IT WAGES ALWAYS COME DOWN WHEN TWO MEN ARE AFTER THE SAME JOB THAT'S THE FAULT OF COMPETITION NOT OF THE MAN WHO CUTS THE PRICE BUT WYGES DON'T COME DOWN WHERE THERE'S A UNION THE OBJECTION WAS MADE
ARE NOT THERE BECAUSE AS A MODE OF LIFE IT MAY BE CONSIDERED A SOFT SNAP I HAVE SUFFICIENTLY OUTLINED THE HARDSHIPS THEY UNDERGO TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR EXISTENCE IS ANYTHING BUT SOFT
TO VIOLATE ANOTHER ORDINARILY UNLESS THE RESPONSE OF CONSCIENCE IS QUICK AND PLAIN MEN ARE NOT BOTHERED BY THE INFRACTION OF THE LAW EXCEPT PERCHANCE BY THE FEAR OF DISCOVERY
THOUGH EACH INEFFICIENT WERE TWICE AS CAPABLE AS HE HAD BEEN AND MORE CAPABLE THAN MANY OF THE EFFICIENTS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN WHEN THERE ARE MORE MEN TO WORK THAN THERE IS WORK FOR MEN TO DO JUST AS MANY MEN AS ARE IN EXCESS OF WORK
THE NUMBER OF THE INEFFICIENTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ABYSS WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ON THE OTHER HAND CONDITIONS REMAINING CONSTANT AND ALL THE WORKERS DOUBLING THEIR EFFICIENCY THERE WOULD STILL BE AS MANY INEFFICIENTS
IS INTERESTED IN KEEPING IT ALIVE AND THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FEAR LOSING THEIR VOTES SOCIAL IDEAS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING NO LAWS OR CUSTOMS ARE ETERNAL THE ORDINARY MAN AND ESPECIALLY THE MAN UNDER THE NORMAL
IS NECESSARY TO SOCIAL LIFE THIS MEANS PUTTING NEW WINE INTO OLD BOTTLES AND WINE THAT IS MUCH TOO STRONG FOR THE BOTTLES EVERYBODY CAN SEE WHY SOME PARTICULAR LAW MIGHT BE VIOLATED
AND WHEN HEAVY WORK WAS TO BE DONE HE WAS THE MAN PICKED OUT TO DO IT AND THEN THE THING HAPPENED AND HE WENT INTO THE WORKHOUSE THE ALTERNATIVE TO THE WORKHOUSE IS TO GO HOME TO IRELAND AND BURDEN HIS FRIENDS FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
IN TIMES OF STRESS THE UNITED STATES SUFFERED SERIOUS ENCROACHMENTS ON LIBERTY DURING THE CIVIL WAR DURING THE LAST WAR THESE ENCROACHMENTS WERE GREATER THAN ANY AMERICAN COULD HAVE POSSIBLY DREAMED
THIS IS QUITE APART FROM THE TEACHING THAT IT IS THE DUTY OF ALL MEN TO OBEY ALL LAWS A PROPOSITION SO GENERAL THAT IT HAS NO EFFECT EVEN THOSE WHO MAKE THE STATEMENT DO NOT FOLLOW THE PRECEPT
THE ACTS OF THE REVOLUTIONIST WHO SAW OR THOUGHT HE SAW VISIONS OF SOMETHING BETTER THE MAN WHO IS INSPIRED BY THE LOVE OF HIS FELLOW MAN AND WHO HAS NO PERSONAL ENDS TO GAIN
THE EXTRACTS ARE QUOTED FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE TRADE UNION I WORKED AT SULLIVAN'S PLACE IN WIDNES BETTER KNOWN AS THE BRITISH ALKALI CHEMICAL WORKS I WAS WORKING IN A SHED AND I HAD TO CROSS THE YARD IT WAS TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND THERE WAS NO LIGHT ABOUT
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED WORKERS THE VERY OPPOSITE IS TRUE THEY ARE DISCOURAGED VAGABONDS IN THE UNITED STATES THE TRAMP IS ALMOST INVARIABLY A DISCOURAGED WORKER HE FINDS TRAMPING A SOFTER MODE OF LIFE THAN WORKING
IT IS A MATTER OF SOBER CALCULATION HERE IN ENGLAND THAT IT IS SOFTER TO WORK FOR TWENTY SHILLINGS A WEEK AND HAVE REGULAR FOOD AND A BED AT NIGHT THAN IT IS TO WALK THE STREETS THE MAN WHO WALKS THE STREETS SUFFERS MORE AND WORKS HARDER
ALL MOVEMENTS FOR RELIGIOUS SOCIAL OR POLITICAL CHANGE HAVE THEIR ZEALOTS THEY ARE MET BY THE FORCE OF CONVENTION AND CONSERVATISM READY TO DEFEND ITSELF AND THE CLASH IS INEVITABLE
RELIGIOUS COMMANDS AND FEELINGS ARE HIGHER AND MORE BINDING ON MAN THAN HUMAN LAW THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY ARE FOREVER BELITTLING AND CRITICISING ALL THOSE LAWS MADE BY LEGISLATURES AND COURTS
THERE YOU ARE CAME THE ANSWER HOW ABOUT THE WIFE AND KIDDIES OF THE MAN WHO WORKS CHEAPER THAN YOU AND GETS YOUR JOB EH HOW ABOUT HIS WIFE AND KIDDIES HE'S MORE INTERESTED IN THEM THAN IN YOURS AND HE CAN'T SEE THEM STARVE SO HE CUTS THE PRICE OF LABOUR AND OUT YOU GO
AT ONCE THE ENGLISH WORKERS WOULD BE THROWN IDLE BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS SOME WOULD EMIGRATE BUT THE REST WOULD RUSH THEIR LABOUR INTO THE REMAINING INDUSTRIES A GENERAL SHAKING UP OF THE WORKERS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WOULD RESULT AND WHEN EQUILIBRIUM HAD BEEN RESTORED
WHILE CROSSING THE YARD I FELT SOMETHING TAKE HOLD OF MY LEG AND SCREW IT OFF I BECAME UNCONSCIOUS
I WAS LABOURING AT THE TIME I GOT MY LEGS OFF I GOT TWENTY FOUR SHILLINGS A WEEK RATHER BETTER PAY THAN THE OTHER MEN BECAUSE I USED TO TAKE SHIFTS WHEN THERE WAS HEAVY WORK TO BE DONE I USED TO BE PICKED OUT TO DO IT MISTER MANTON THE MANAGER VISITED ME AT THE HOSPITAL SEVERAL TIMES
THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO WILL USE THE STRONGEST AND HIGHEST EMOTIONS OF MEN TO SERVE THEIR PRIVATE SORDID ENDS CHANGING SOCIAL SYSTEMS NEW POLITICAL IDEAS THE LABOR CAUSE
WILL BUY HIM THREE FAIR MEALS A BED AT NIGHT AND LEAVE HIM A COUPLE OF PENNIES FOR POCKET MONEY HE WOULD RATHER WORK FOR THOSE TWO SHILLINGS THAN FOR THE CHARITY OF THE CASUAL WARD FOR HE KNOWS THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO WORK SO HARD AND THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SO ABOMINABLY TREATED
AND BE QUICK AS A RAT DOG TO SEE IF THERE BE ROOM AND IF THERE BE TIME LEST YOU GET YOUR OWN WHEELS LOCKED OR SMASHED OR THE SHAFT OF SOME OTHER VEHICLE RUN INTO YOUR CHEST OR SHOULDER ALL THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR
AFTER THE BLINDING SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SULPHUROUS GROUND
I WENT NORTHEASTWARD IN A DIRECTION AT RIGHT ANGLES TO MY PREVIOUS EXPEDITION ONCE AS I WENT RUNNING HEADLONG UP THE BEACH I GLANCED OVER MY SHOULDER AND SAW HIS ATTENDANT WITH HIM I RAN FURIOUSLY UP THE SLOPE OVER IT
AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR I HEARD MONTGOMERY SHOUTING MY NAME FAR AWAY TO THE NORTH THAT SET ME THINKING OF MY PLAN OF ACTION AS I INTERPRETED IT THEN
GROWING IN BEAUTIFUL ORDER ON MORAINES SCARCELY CHANGED AS YET BY POST GLACIAL WEATHERING COMPARED WITH THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER REGIONS THIS IS A SMALL TREE SELDOM EXCEEDING A HEIGHT OF EIGHTY OR NINETY FEET
AND HIS BRIGHT RESTLESS EYES TRAVELLED OVER ME TO MY HANDS TO THE STICK I CARRIED TO MY FEET TO THE TATTERED PLACES IN MY COAT AND THE CUTS AND SCRATCHES I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE THORNS HE SEEMED PUZZLED AT SOMETHING HIS EYES CAME BACK TO MY HANDS
OFTEN GIVING A REDDISH YELLOW TINGE TO THE WHOLE MASS OF FOLIAGE AND FILLING THE AIR WITH POLLEN NO OTHER PINE ON THE RANGE IS SO REGULARLY PLANTED AS THIS ONE COVERING MORAINES THAT EXTEND ALONG THE SIDES OF THE HIGH ROCKY VALLEYS FOR MILES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
ONE ON THE STARR KING RIDGE ONLY TWO FEET ELEVEN INCHES IN DIAMETER
THE LOWER LIMBS LIKE THOSE OF MOST OTHER CONIFERS THAT GROW IN SNOWY REGIONS CURVE DOWNWARD GRADUALLY TAKE A HORIZONTAL POSITION ABOUT HALF WAY UP THE TRUNK THEN ASPIRE MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE SUMMIT
HE COULD NOT BEAR ANY CARELESS LOITERING AND WASTE OF TIME AND NOTHING WAS SO NEAR MAKING HIM ANGRY AS TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WERE ALWAYS LATE WANTING A CAB HORSE TO BE DRIVEN HARD TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR IDLENESS
I KNEW NO WAY OF GETTING ANYTHING TO EAT I WAS TOO IGNORANT OF BOTANY TO DISCOVER ANY RESORT OF ROOT OR FRUIT THAT MIGHT LIE ABOUT ME I HAD NO MEANS OF TRAPPING THE FEW RABBITS UPON THE ISLAND
ANOTHER ON THE SAME RIDGE ONLY ONE FOOT SEVEN AND A HALF INCHES IN DIAMETER HAD REACHED THE AGE OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR YEARS THE FIRST FIFTEEN INCHES FROM THE BARK OF A MEDIUM SIZE TREE SIX FEET IN DIAMETER ON THE NORTH TENAYA PAVEMENT
IN CALM SUN DAYS THE SUGAR PINE PREACHES LIKE AN ENTHUSIASTIC APOSTLE WITHOUT MOVING A LEAF ON LEVEL ROCKS THE JUNIPER DIES STANDING AND WASTES INSENSIBLY OUT OF EXISTENCE LIKE GRANITE THE WIND EXERTING ABOUT AS LITTLE CONTROL OVER IT
YOU SHALL HAVE A SHILLING EXTRA I WILL TAKE YOU AT THE REGULAR PACE GENTLEMEN SHILLINGS DON'T PAY FOR PUTTING ON THE STEAM LIKE THAT LARRY'S CAB WAS STANDING NEXT TO OURS HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND SAID
WADING UP THE CREEK AND PRESENTLY FINDING MYSELF KNEEDEEP IN A LITTLE STREAM I SCRAMBLED OUT AT LAST ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND WITH MY HEART BEATING LOUDLY IN MY EARS CREPT INTO A TANGLE OF FERNS TO AWAIT THE ISSUE I HEARD THE DOG
SOME ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD FOR THOUGH ON DEEP MORAINE SOIL THEY GROW ABOUT AS FAST AS SOME OF THE PINES ON BARE PAVEMENTS AND SMOOTHLY GLACIATED OVERSWEPT RIDGES IN THE DOME REGION THEY GROW VERY SLOWLY
DECORATED WITH A FEW LEAFY SPRAYS REMINDING ONE OF THE CRUMBLING TOWERS OF OLD CASTLES SCANTILY DRAPED WITH IVY ITS HOMES ON BARE BARREN DOME AND RIDGE TOP SEEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR SAFETY AGAINST FIRE
FROM A ROPE OF CREEPERS THAT LOOPED DOWN FROM THE FOLIAGE OVERHEAD HIS BACK WAS TO ME HULLO SAID I HE CAME DOWN WITH A TWISTING JUMP AND STOOD FACING ME I SAY SAID I
IN SHELTERED LAKE HOLLOWS ON BEDS OF ALLUVIUM THIS PINE VARIES SO FAR FROM THE COMMON FORM THAT FREQUENTLY IT COULD BE TAKEN FOR A DISTINCT SPECIES GROWING IN DAMP SODS LIKE GRASSES FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY FEET HIGH
CLINGING BY SLIGHT JOINTS TO THE ROCKS LIVING CHIEFLY ON SNOW AND THIN AIR AND MAINTAINING SOUND HEALTH ON THIS DIET FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE EVERY FEATURE OR EVERY GESTURE IT MAKES EXPRESSES STEADFAST DOGGED ENDURANCE
OMNIBUSES CARTS VANS TRUCKS CABS AND GREAT WAGONS CREEPING ALONG AT A WALKING PACE SOME GOING ONE WAY SOME ANOTHER SOME GOING SLOWLY OTHERS WANTING TO PASS THEM OMNIBUSES STOPPING SHORT EVERY FEW MINUTES TO TAKE UP A PASSENGER
THE YOUNG MAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT AND SAID ANXIOUSLY I THINK I HAD BETTER GET OUT AND WALK I SHALL NEVER GET THERE IF THIS GOES ON I'LL DO ALL THAT CAN BE DONE SIR SAID JERRY I THINK WE SHALL BE IN TIME
AND COULD ALWAYS TRUST MY DRIVER JERRY WAS QUICK AND PATIENT AT THE SAME TIME AND COULD TRUST HIS HORSE WHICH WAS A GREAT THING TOO HE VERY SELDOM USED THE WHIP I KNEW BY HIS VOICE AND HIS CLICK CLICK WHEN HE WANTED TO GET ON FAST
AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND FEET EXTENDING ITS TOUGH RATHER SLENDER ARMS IN THE FROSTY AIR WELCOMING THE STORMS AND FEEDING ON THEM AND REACHING SOMETIMES TO THE GRAND OLD AGE
INCREASING IN VELOCITY AND DRAGGING THE FLAMES UPWARD THEN THE LEAVES CATCH FORMING AN IMMENSE COLUMN OF FIRE BEAUTIFULLY SPIRED ON THE EDGES AND TINTED A ROSE PURPLE HUE IT RUSHES ALOFT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE TREE
AT LENGTH THE ROOTS DECAY AND THE FORLORN GRAY TRUNKS ARE BLOWN DOWN DURING SOME STORM AND PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER ENCUMBERING THE GROUND UNTIL DRY AND SEASONED THEY ARE CONSUMED BY ANOTHER FIRE AND LEAVE THE GROUND READY FOR A FRESH CROP
CAN YOU TAKE ME TO THE SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY SAID THE YOUNG MAN THIS UNLUCKY FALL HAS MADE ME LATE I FEAR BUT IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT I SHOULD NOT LOSE THE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN I SHOULD BE MOST THANKFUL IF YOU COULD GET ME THERE IN TIME
SO GLAD WE HIT THE TIME SIR BUT DON'T STAY NOW SIR THE BELL IS RINGING HERE PORTER TAKE THIS GENTLEMAN'S LUGGAGE DOVER LINE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN THAT'S IT AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANOTHER WORD
DON'T SUFFER FOR ME A PARTING BLESSING FOR OUR CHILD I SEND IT TO HER BY YOU I KISS HER BY YOU I SAY FAREWELL TO HER BY YOU MY HUSBAND NO A MOMENT HE WAS TEARING HIMSELF APART FROM HER
FOLLOWED SYDNEY TO THE OUTER DOOR AND TOUCHING HIM ON THE SHOULDER AS HE WAS GOING AWAY CAUSED HIM TO TURN I HAVE NO HOPE SAID MISTER LORRY IN A LOW AND SORROWFUL WHISPER NOR HAVE I IF ANY ONE OF THESE MEN
THAT'S WELL I HAVE KNOWN SUCH ENERGY AS YOURS DO GREAT THINGS BEFORE NOW THOUGH NEVER HE ADDED WITH A SMILE AND A SIGH TOGETHER SUCH GREAT THINGS AS THIS BUT TRY
IT IS GOOD UNTIL RECALLED BUT IT MAY BE SOON RECALLED AND I HAVE REASON TO THINK WILL BE THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER THEY ARE IN GREAT DANGER THEY ARE IN DANGER OF DENUNCIATION BY MADAME DEFARGE
CONSOLATORY TO HER
HE TOOK A TURN OR TWO IN THE ALREADY DARKENING STREET AND TRACED THE THOUGHT IN HIS MIND TO ITS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES HIS FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CONFIRMED IT IS BEST HE SAID FINALLY RESOLVED
OF LITTLE WORTH AS LIFE IS WHEN WE MISUSE IT IT IS WORTH THAT EFFORT IT WOULD COST NOTHING TO LAY DOWN IF IT WERE NOT I WILL GO SAID DOCTOR MANETTE TO THE PROSECUTOR AND THE PRESIDENT STRAIGHT
THE AMIABLE VENGEANCE ADDED WITH A LAUGH YES MY FAITH AND YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE TO SEEING HIM ONCE MORE TO MORROW CARTON FOLLOWED THE LINES AND WORDS OF HIS PAPER WITH A SLOW FOREFINGER
WHEN THE BASTILLE FALLS HE FINDS THIS PAPER OF TO DAY AND HE BRINGS IT HOME AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN THIS PLACE IS CLEAR AND SHUT WE READ IT HERE ON THIS SPOT BY THE LIGHT OF THIS LAMP ASK HIM IS THAT SO
BUT I WILL DO MY DUTY WHILE I CAN AND WHEN I LEAVE HER GOD WILL RAISE UP FRIENDS FOR HER AS HE DID FOR ME HER FATHER HAD FOLLOWED HER AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN ON HIS KNEES TO BOTH OF THEM BUT THAT DARNAY PUT OUT A HAND AND SEIZED HIM CRYING NO NO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
THOUGH HE SAID IT WITH A GRAVE SMILE OF EARNESTNESS AND THOUGH HE EVEN PUT THE OLD MAN'S HAND TO HIS LIPS HE DID NOT PART FROM HIM THEN HE HELPED HIM SO FAR TO AROUSE THE ROCKING FIGURE BEFORE THE DYING EMBERS AS TO GET A CLOAK AND HAT PUT UPON IT
IT IS EASY TO FORESEE THAT THE PRETENCE WILL BE THE COMMON ONE A PRISON PLOT AND THAT IT WILL INVOLVE HER LIFE AND PERHAPS HER CHILD'S AND PERHAPS HER FATHER'S FOR BOTH HAVE BEEN SEEN WITH HER AT THAT PLACE DON'T LOOK SO HORRIFIED YOU WILL SAVE THEM ALL
MISTER LORRY HELD IT OPEN IN HIS HAND GAZING IN HIS EARNEST FACE KEEP IT FOR ME UNTIL TO MORROW I SHALL SEE HIM TO MORROW YOU REMEMBER AND I HAD BETTER NOT TAKE IT INTO THE PRISON WHY NOT I DON'T KNOW I PREFER NOT TO DO SO
AND TO LET IT FALL WITH A RATTLE ON THE LEDGE BEFORE HER AS IF THE AXE HAD DROPPED THE CITIZENESS IS SUPERB CROAKED THE JURYMAN SHE IS AN ANGEL SAID THE VENGEANCE AND EMBRACED HER
NOW TAKE THIS PAPER THAT DOCTOR MANETTE HAS CARRIED ABOUT HIM IT IS A SIMILAR CERTIFICATE ENABLING HIM AND HIS DAUGHTER AND HER CHILD AT ANY TIME TO PASS THE BARRIER AND THE FRONTIER YOU SEE YES
TO EACH PINT OF JUICE PUT A POUND OF SUGAR BOIL THEM TOGETHER TILL IT BECOMES A JELLY WHEN COLD PUT IT IN A JAR AND TIE IT CLOSE USE A SMALL QUANTITY OF THIS TO STAIN ICE CREAM OR JELLY
AND PEACH KERNELS POUR BOILING WATER ON THEM WHICH WILL MAKE THEM PEEL EASILY EITHER ROLL THEM WITH A BOTTLE ON THE CAKE BOARD OR POUND IN A MORTAR WITH A LITTLE LOAF SUGAR THEY SHOULD NOT BE POUNDED TOO MUCH OR THEY WILL BE OILY
HE RETURNED THE ANSWER IN GREAT TROUBLE AND VERY SLOWLY TRY THEM AGAIN THE HOURS BETWEEN THIS AND TO MORROW AFTERNOON ARE FEW AND SHORT BUT TRY I INTEND TO TRY I WILL NOT REST A MOMENT
CARTON TOOK IT UP AND THERE WAS A FOLDED PAPER IN IT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THIS HE SAID MISTER LORRY NODDED HIS CONSENT HE OPENED IT AND EXCLAIMED THANK GOD WHAT IS IT ASKED MISTER LORRY EAGERLY
WHO HAD DONE WITH IT IT WAS AS LATE AS SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN HE AWOKE REFRESHED AND WENT OUT INTO THE STREETS AGAIN AS HE PASSED ALONG TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE HE STOPPED AT A SHOP WINDOW WHERE THERE WAS A MIRROR
THESE JUDGES AND ALL THE MEN IN POWER ARE VERY FRIENDLY TO YOU AND VERY RECOGNISANT OF YOUR SERVICES ARE THEY NOT NOTHING CONNECTED WITH CHARLES WAS CONCEALED FROM ME I HAD THE STRONGEST ASSURANCES THAT I SHOULD SAVE HIM AND I DID
KEEP IT CORKED UP IN A BOTTLE TO SEASON ICE CREAM SYRUP OF LEMON JUICE DISSOLVE THREE POUNDS OF LOAF SUGAR IN THREE QUARTS OF WATER SQUEEZE AND STRAIN LEMONS ENOUGH TO MAKE A QUART OF JUICE BOIL IT SLOWLY WITH THE WATER AND SUGAR AND TAKE OFF THE SCUM AS IT RISES
PROMISE ME SOLEMNLY THAT NOTHING WILL INFLUENCE YOU TO ALTER THE COURSE ON WHICH WE NOW STAND PLEDGED TO ONE ANOTHER NOTHING CARTON REMEMBER THESE WORDS TO MORROW CHANGE THE COURSE OR DELAY IN IT FOR ANY REASON AND NO LIFE
AND SLIGHTLY ALTERED THE DISORDERED ARRANGEMENT OF HIS LOOSE CRAVAT AND HIS COAT COLLAR AND HIS WILD HAIR THIS DONE HE WENT ON DIRECT TO DEFARGE'S AND WENT IN THERE HAPPENED TO BE NO CUSTOMER IN THE SHOP BUT JACQUES THREE
AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE EMERGED FROM IT TO PRESENT HIMSELF IN MISTER LORRY'S ROOM AGAIN WHERE HE FOUND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WALKING TO AND FRO IN RESTLESS ANXIETY HE SAID HE HAD BEEN WITH LUCIE UNTIL JUST NOW
I HAVE OBSERVED HER TO DAY AND I HAVE OBSERVED HER OTHER DAYS I HAVE OBSERVED HER IN THE COURT AND I HAVE OBSERVED HER IN THE STREET BY THE PRISON LET ME BUT LIFT MY FINGER SHE SEEMED TO RAISE IT THE LISTENER'S EYES WERE ALWAYS ON HIS PAPER
TO SO UNHAPPY A BEGINNING BE COMFORTED AND FORGIVE ME HEAVEN BLESS YOU AS HE WAS DRAWN AWAY HIS WIFE RELEASED HIM AND STOOD LOOKING AFTER HIM WITH HER HANDS TOUCHING ONE ANOTHER IN THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER
IT WON'T DO TO HAVE A HORSE'S BELLY CLEAN AND HIS BACK DIRTY YOU KNOW GIVE ME A LEG SAID DIAMOND AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS ON THE OLD HORSE'S BACK WITH THE COMB AND BRUSH HE SAT ON HIS WITHERS AND REACHING FORWARD AS HE ATE HIS HAY
HERE YOU HAVE A LIGHT LIKE MINE FLASH IT ON AND HANG IT SOMEWHERE ON YOURSELF THEN GET A CLUB AND COME ON THE LIGHTS WILL BLIND THE BATS AND WE CAN SEE TO HIT EM TOM'S PLAN SEEMED TO BE A GOOD ONE HIS LAMP AND NED'S HAD SMALL HOOKS ON THEM
WHY IS THAT WHY PERSISTED DIAMOND
TOM AND NED KICKED OUTSIDE THE BAT THE FORMER HAD KILLED IN THEIR TENT AND THEN BOTH WENT BACK TO THEIR COTS BUT IT WAS SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE THEY FELL ASLEEP AND THEY DID NOT HAVE MUCH TIME TO REST
SUNG HIS EVENING HYMN AND SAID I CANNOT FIND WHAT I SEEK THE SUN IS GOING DOWN AND NIGHT IS COMING THE DARK DARK NIGHT YET PERHAPS I MAY BE ABLE ONCE MORE TO SEE THE ROUND RED SUN BEFORE HE ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS
AND THE RICH PEOPLE DROVE OUT AND THE POOR WALKED BUT THE WAY SEEMED STRANGELY LONG TO THEM AND WHEN THEY CAME TO A CLUMP OF WILLOWS WHICH GREW ON THE SKIRTS OF THE FOREST THEY SAT DOWN
HE IS THE SON OF A KING BUT ON HE WENT WITHOUT BEING DISHEARTENED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOOD WHERE THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS WERE GROWING THERE STOOD WHITE LILIES WITH BLOOD RED STAMINA
SOME ROUGH YOUNG IMPS HAD PICKED A QUARREL WITH HER AND WERE NOW HAULING AT HER BROOM TO GET IT AWAY FROM HER BUT AS THEY DID NOT PULL ALL TOGETHER SHE WAS HOLDING IT AGAINST THEM SCOLDING AND ENTREATING ALTERNATELY DIAMOND WAS OFF HIS BOX IN A MOMENT AND RUNNING TO THE HELP OF THE GIRL
ONE OF THEM LIFTED HIM DOWN AND FROM THAT TIME HE WAS A GREATER FAVOURITE THAN BEFORE AND IF EVER THERE WAS A BOY WHO HAD A CHANCE OF BEING A PRODIGY AT CAB DRIVING DIAMOND WAS THAT BOY FOR THE STRIFE CAME TO BE WHO SHOULD HAVE HIM OUT WITH HIM ON THE BOX
AND SCRATCHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND FEET TILL THEY BLED THE KING'S SON GOT SOME SCRATCHES TOO BUT THE SUN SHONE ON HIS PATH
THERE WERE THREE PERSONS WHO ASSERTED THEY HAD PENETRATED TO THE END OF THE FOREST
IN THE VAST CHURCH OF NATURE AND OF POETRY WHILE OVER THEM SOUNDED THE INVISIBLE HOLY BELL
HE CURRIED AND HE BRUSHED FIRST AT ONE SIDE OF HIS NECK AND THEN AT THE OTHER WHEN THAT WAS DONE HE ASKED FOR A DRESSING COMB AND COMBED HIS MANE THOROUGHLY THEN HE PUSHED HIMSELF ON TO HIS BACK
HE CAUGHT UP HIS CAMERA TRIPOD WHICH WAS NEAR HIS COT AND MADE A SWING WITH IT AT THE CREATURE THAT HAD FLOWN INTO THE TENT THROUGH AN OPENING IT HAD MADE FOR ITSELF LOOK OUT YELLED NED IF IT'S A VAMPIRE IT'LL IT WON'T DO ANYTHING TO ME SHOUTED TOM AS HE STRUCK THE CREATURE
THEY MAY THERE IS NO TELLING BLESS MY SPEEDOMETER CRIED MISTER DAMON IF THOSE BEASTS OR BIRDS WHATEVER THEY ARE COME BACK I'LL GO AND HIDE IN THE RIVER AND TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE ALLIGATORS
ONE DAY WHICH WAS NEITHER WASHING DAY NOR CLEANING DAY NOR MARKETING DAY NOR SATURDAY NOR MONDAY UPON WHICH CONSEQUENTLY DIAMOND COULD BE SPARED FROM THE BABY HIS FATHER TOOK HIM ON HIS OWN CAB
THEIR CLOTHES WOULD GET SO TORN LARGE BLOCKS OF STONE LAY THERE OVERGROWN WITH MOSS OF EVERY COLOR THE FRESH SPRING BUBBLED FORTH AND MADE A STRANGE GURGLING SOUND THAT SURELY CANNOT BE THE BELL SAID ONE OF THE CHILDREN LYING DOWN AND LISTENING
FOR NOW THE INDIANS HAD SET SEVERAL FIRES AGLOW AND IN THE GLEAMS CONSTANTLY GROWING BRIGHTER AS MORE FUEL WAS PILED ON
THE BELL PEOPLE SAID THE EVENING BELL IS SOUNDING THE SUN IS SETTING FOR A STRANGE WONDROUS TONE WAS HEARD IN THE NARROW STREETS OF A LARGE TOWN IT WAS LIKE THE SOUND OF A CHURCH BELL BUT IT WAS ONLY HEARD FOR A MOMENT
THE BATS FLEW BACK TO THE JUNGLE WHENCE THEY HAD EMERGED WE ARE SAFE FOR THE PRESENT EXCLAIMED JACINTO WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
BUT THE DEEP SOUND OF THE BELL ROSE LOUDER IT WAS ALMOST AS IF AN ORGAN WERE ACCOMPANYING IT AND THE TONES CAME FROM THE LEFT HAND THE SIDE WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED A RUSTLING WAS HEARD IN THE BUSHES AND A LITTLE BOY STOOD BEFORE THE KING'S SON
WE SHALL MARCH THERE IN THE MORNING NO USE TO GO THERE AT NIGHT WHEN ALL IS DARK I SUPPOSE THAT IS SO THE INDIANS MADE CAMP AS USUAL THE GOODS BEING BROUGHT FROM THE CANOES AND PILED UP NEAR THE TENTS THEN NIGHT SETTLED DOWN
AND WOOD AND SEA
HIS MOTHER HOWEVER WAS A LITTLE SHY OF THE COMPANY FOR HIM AND BESIDES SHE COULD NOT ALWAYS SPARE HIM ALSO HIS FATHER LIKED TO HAVE HIM HIMSELF WHEN HE COULD SO THAT HE WAS MORE DESIRED THAN ENJOYED AMONG THE CABMEN
THE UNCANNY CREATURES FLEW IN AND OUT AMONG THE TREES AND TENTS NOW SWOOPING LOW NEAR THE INDIANS OR THE TRAVELERS AT SUCH TIMES CLUBS WOULD BE USED OFTEN WITH THE EFFECT OF KILLING OR STUNNING THE FLYING PESTS
AND FROM THE WOOD WAS BORNE TOWARDS THEM THE SOUNDS OF THE UNKNOWN BELL WITH WONDERFUL DISTINCTNESS THEY ALL IMMEDIATELY FELT A WISH TO GO THITHER ALL EXCEPT THREE ONE OF THEM HAD TO GO HOME TO TRY ON A BALL DRESS
MOST OF WHICH LIVED ON FRUIT OR ON INSECTS THEY CAUGHT THE BLOOD SUCKING BATS WERE COMPARATIVELY FEW AND THE MIGRATORY SORT FEWER STILL WELL WE'RE ON OUR WAY ONCE MORE REMARKED TOM AS AGAIN THEY WERE IN THE CANOES BEING PADDLED UP THE RIVER
I WILL CLIMB UP YONDER ROCK AND HE SEIZED HOLD OF THE CREEPING PLANTS AND THE ROOTS OF TREES CLIMBED UP THE MOIST STONES WHERE THE WATER SNAKES WERE WRITHING AND THE TOADS WERE CROAKING
I SEE OBSERVED TOM CALMLY HAND ME THE RIFLE NED TOM TOOK QUICK AIM AND PULLED THE TRIGGER THE EXPLOSIVE ELECTRIC BULLET WENT TRUE TO ITS MARK AND THE GREAT ANIMAL TURNED OVER IN A DEATH STRUGGLE
WHAT IS IT WHAT'S THE MATTER CRIED TOM SPRINGING FROM HIS COT AND HASTENING TO THE SIDE OF HIS CHUM IN THE TENT
SO HE WAS QUITE PLEASED AND PROUD AND PERHAPS SAID TO HIMSELF SOMETHING LIKE THIS I'M A STUPID OLD HORSE WHO CAN'T BRUSH HIS OWN COAT BUT THERE'S MY YOUNG GODSON ON MY BACK CLEANING ME LIKE AN ANGEL I WON'T VOUCH FOR WHAT THE OLD HORSE WAS THINKING
THEN TOM NOTICED SOMETHING QUEER THE CANOES WERE NOT ON THE RIVER BANK THERE WAS NOT AN INDIAN IN SIGHT AND NO EVIDENCE OF JACINTO WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAVE THE OTHERS GONE ON AHEAD
EMMA MUST DO HARRIET GOOD AND BY SUPPLYING HER WITH A NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST HARRIET MAY BE SAID TO DO EMMA GOOD I HAVE BEEN SEEING THEIR INTIMACY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE HOW VERY DIFFERENTLY WE FEEL NOT THINK THEY WILL DO EACH OTHER ANY GOOD
FROM THE OPPOSITION OF TWO LEADING PRINCIPLES SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS AS SOLICITOUS FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY
THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY FEELINGLY AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE BUT I HE SOON ADDED WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES
PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
ON HIS OWN TERMS AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE LADY RUSSELL HAD ANOTHER EXCELLENT ONE AT HAND FOR BEING EXTREMELY GLAD THAT SIR WALTER AND HIS FAMILY WERE TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY
THIS WILL CERTAINLY BE THE BEGINNING OF ONE OF OUR QUARRELS ABOUT EMMA MISTER KNIGHTLEY
SHE WAS A CLEVER YOUNG WOMAN WHO UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF PLEASING
AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A GIRL IN HIGHBURY FOR HER TO ASSOCIATE WITH MISTER KNIGHTLEY I SHALL NOT ALLOW YOU TO BE A FAIR JUDGE IN THIS CASE YOU ARE SO MUCH USED TO LIVE ALONE
AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION
ISABELLA SLOW AND DIFFIDENT AND EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE EMMA HAS BEEN MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND OF YOU ALL IN HER MOTHER SHE LOST THE ONLY PERSON ABLE TO COPE WITH HER SHE INHERITS HER MOTHER'S TALENTS AND MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER SUBJECTION TO HER
I HOPE NOT THAT IT IS NOT LIKELY NO MISTER KNIGHTLEY DO NOT FORETELL VEXATION FROM THAT QUARTER NOT I INDEED I ONLY NAME POSSIBILITIES I DO NOT PRETEND TO EMMA'S GENIUS FOR FORETELLING AND GUESSING
WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED
SHE WILL NEVER SUBMIT TO ANY THING REQUIRING INDUSTRY AND PATIENCE AND A SUBJECTION OF THE FANCY TO THE UNDERSTANDING WHERE MISS TAYLOR FAILED TO STIMULATE I MAY SAFELY AFFIRM THAT HARRIET SMITH WILL DO NOTHING
WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING
FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
YOU NEVER COULD PERSUADE HER TO READ HALF SO MUCH AS YOU WISHED YOU KNOW YOU COULD NOT I DARE SAY REPLIED MISSUS WESTON SMILING THAT I THOUGHT SO THEN BUT SINCE WE HAVE PARTED I CAN NEVER REMEMBER EMMA'S OMITTING TO DO ANY THING I WISHED
AND STILL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES SEEING THE LAWNS AND GROVES OF KELLYNCH WAS THE OBJECT OF HER AMBITION BUT THE USUAL FATE OF ANNE ATTENDED HER IN HAVING SOMETHING VERY OPPOSITE FROM HER INCLINATION FIXED ON SHE DISLIKED BATH AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER
SHE HAD A VALUE FOR RANK AND CONSEQUENCE WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER
MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT
WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
DO YOU REALLY THINK IT A BAD THING WHY SO I THINK THEY WILL NEITHER OF THEM DO THE OTHER ANY GOOD
THAT THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE EMMA IN LOVE AND IN SOME DOUBT OF A RETURN IT WOULD DO HER GOOD BUT THERE IS NOBODY HEREABOUTS TO ATTACH HER AND SHE GOES SO SELDOM FROM HOME THERE DOES INDEED
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY
I WILL NOT RAISE ANY OUTCRY I WILL KEEP MY ILL HUMOUR TO MYSELF I HAVE A VERY SINCERE INTEREST IN EMMA ISABELLA DOES NOT SEEM MORE MY SISTER HAS NEVER EXCITED A GREATER INTEREST PERHAPS HARDLY SO GREAT
TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY
IT WAS A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT
THAT THE PROSPECT OF THE INTRODUCTION HAD GIVEN AS MUCH PANIC AS PLEASURE BUT THE HUMBLE GRATEFUL LITTLE GIRL WENT OFF WITH HIGHLY GRATIFIED FEELINGS
AH THESE MUSKETEERS OF YOURS ARE VERY DEVILS FELLOWS TO BE HANGED NO SIRE REPLIED TREVILLE WHO SAW AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOW THINGS WOULD GO ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE GOOD CREATURES AS MEEK AS LAMBS AND HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE
THEY SUCCEEDED IN CALMING THEIR FRIENDS WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HURLING SOME PAVING STONES AGAINST THE GATES BUT THE GATES WERE TOO STRONG THEY SOON TIRED OF THE SPORT BESIDES THOSE WHO MUST BE CONSIDERED THE LEADERS OF THE ENTERPRISE HAD QUIT THE GROUP AND WERE MAKING THEIR WAY
I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
AND WHO HAVE I DARE AFFIRM TO THE KING HIS SERVICE MUCH AT HEART THREE OF MY BEST SOLDIERS I SAY
THE MASTER OF THE HOUNDS CAME THIS MORNING TO INFORM HIM THAT HE HAD MARKED DOWN A STAG AT FIRST THE KING ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD NOT GO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST HIS LOVE OF SPORT AND SET OUT AFTER DINNER AND THE KING HAS SEEN THE CARDINAL
THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
IT IS WOMAN WHO HAS RUINED US STILL RUINS US AND WILL RUIN US AS LONG AS THE WORLD STANDS TAKE MY ADVICE AND SET OUT THIS EVENING
WHY IT IS INDEED A TRUE ROYAL JEWEL
IT IS NOT NATURAL FOR LETTERS TO ENTER PEOPLE'S HOUSES IN THIS MANNER IF THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN OR EVEN AJAR I SHOULD THINK NOTHING OF IT BUT NO ALL WAS HERMETICALLY SEALED
HE HAD RETIRED AT ONE O'CLOCK UNDER THE PRETENSE OF BEING INDISPOSED AS TO THEIR MAJESTIES THEY DID NOT RETURN TO THE LOUVRE TILL SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING NOW SAID TREVILLE LOWERING HIS VOICE AND LOOKING INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE APARTMENT TO SEE IF THEY WERE ALONE
I PREFER TRAVELING ALONE TO HAVING A COMPANION WHO ENTERTAINS THE LEAST FEAR
BY THE BY YOU CAN BE SURE OF YOUR LACKEY MISTRUST EVERYBODY YOUR FRIEND YOUR BROTHER YOUR MISTRESS YOUR MISTRESS ABOVE ALL D'ARTAGNAN BLUSHED MY MISTRESS ABOVE ALL REPEATED HE MECHANICALLY
HE WAS DRESSED AS A CITIZEN THE GUARDS OF THE CARDINAL PERCEIVING HIS YOUTH AND THAT HE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CORPS INVITED HIM TO RETIRE BEFORE THEY ATTACKED SO YOU MAY PLAINLY SEE TREVILLE INTERRUPTED THE KING IT WAS THEY WHO ATTACKED
ALTHOUGH HE PLAYED WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE FOUND THAT HIS WOUND WAS YET TOO RECENT TO ALLOW OF SUCH EXERTION
WITH A LETTER IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HIM TO EJECT THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO REPRIMAND HIS PEOPLE FOR THEIR AUDACITY IN MAKING SORTIE AGAINST THE KING'S MUSKETEERS
PERFECTLY DOES HE TALK WITH DIFFICULTY BUT HE CAN SPEAK
HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
ARE THERE NOT SOME LATIN VERSES UPON THAT SUBJECT STOP YES DOUBTLESS REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
AT THESE CRIES ALL WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL RUSHED OUT AND FELL UPON THE FOUR COMPANIONS WHO ON THEIR SIDE CRIED ALOUD TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS THIS CRY WAS GENERALLY HEEDED
WAS BUSY GROOMING THEM AND HAD ALREADY FINISHED TWO
WHICH MAY BETRAY HIM WHO WEARS IT SELL THIS RING A RING WHICH COMES FROM MY SOVEREIGN NEVER SAID D'ARTAGNAN THEN AT LEAST TURN THE GEM INSIDE YOU SILLY FELLOW FOR EVERYBODY MUST BE AWARE THAT A CADET FROM GASCONY
HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE REMARKED IT
WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOUR THREE COMPANIONS
DO YOU KNOW THAT HIS EMINENCE HAS BEEN MAKING FRESH COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOUR MUSKETEERS
THEY MERIT RICHLY THAT PIECE OF ATTENTION ON YOUR PART
BESIDES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID A LITTLE CONDESCENSION TOWARD A HUSBAND WHOSE PRETTY WIFE HAS APPOINTED A MEETING WITH YOU THAT SAME EVENING AT SAINT CLOUD
HIS HEART SWELLED BY THE INTOXICATION OF JOY FELT READY TO DISSOLVE AWAY AT THE VERY GATE OF THAT TERRESTRIAL PARADISE CALLED LOVE
BUT I LEAVE YOUR MAJESTY TO JUDGE WHAT FIVE ARMED MEN COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING TO DO IN SUCH A DESERTED PLACE AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
D'ARTAGNAN FOUND THE MUSKETEER DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT AS THE HOUR TO WAIT UPON THE KING WAS NOT TILL TWELVE HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH PORTHOS AND ARAMIS TO PLAY A GAME AT TENNIS
TO HIS EMINENCE THUS THE SOLDIERS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE RED DUKE AS ARAMIS HAD CALLED HIM OFTEN TOOK PART WITH THE KING'S MUSKETEERS IN THESE QUARRELS
WE ARE GOING AGAIN IT APPEARS TO HAVE OUR HIDES PIERCED IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS YOU WILL TAKE YOUR MUSKETOON AND YOUR PISTOLS
THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
D'ARTAGNAN'S INTENTION WAS TO GO OUT WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE WORTHY MERCER BUT THE LATTER MADE SO POLITE AND FRIENDLY A SALUTATION THAT HIS TENANT FELT OBLIGED NOT ONLY TO STOP BUT TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM
HAS HE NOT ALL THE TRICKS OF A DEMON AT HIS COMMAND THE LEAST THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IS THAT YOU WILL BE ARRESTED WHAT WILL THEY DARE TO ARREST A MAN IN HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE PARDIEU
HIS EYES THEREFORE WERE FIXED IN A SORT OF AGONY UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE KING MUST ENTER
AND KNOWS THAT I HAVE BEEN TO LONDON THE DEVIL YOU HAVE BEEN TO LONDON WAS IT FROM LONDON YOU BROUGHT THAT BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND THAT GLITTERS ON YOUR FINGER BEWARE MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN A PRESENT FROM AN ENEMY IS NOT A GOOD THING
AND LET US ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE KING BEFORE HE IS PREJUDICED BY THE CARDINAL
EXCITEMENT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AMONG THE MUSKETEERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THEY EVEN BEGAN TO DELIBERATE WHETHER THEY SHOULD NOT SET FIRE TO THE HOTEL
HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU WHY SO PLANCHET ASKED THE YOUNG MAN
WHICH WAS FIXED FOR MIDDAY HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND AND SEEING THAT THE STREET WAS EMPTY SAID TO HIS ADVERSARY MY FAITH IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU ALTHOUGH YOUR NAME IS BERNAJOUX TO HAVE ONLY TO DEAL WITH AN APPRENTICE MUSKETEER
BUT I WILL NOT SWEAR TO IT SIRE YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AND UNLESS A MAN BE ENDOWED WITH THAT ADMIRABLE INSTINCT
WHOM PORTHOS ASSISTED IN ROLLING HER HUSBAND UP TO THE TABLE
AND WHICH FORBADE HIM EVEN TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST COMPLAINT AT LENGTH AFTER WINDING ABOUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
OH OH SAID HE HERE IS A SOUP WHICH IS RATHER INVITING WHAT THE DEVIL CAN THEY SMELL SO EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS SOUP SAID PORTHOS AT THE SIGHT OF A PALE LIQUID ABUNDANT BUT ENTIRELY FREE FROM MEAT
A PROCURATOR'S DINNER HOWEVER BRILLIANT HAD BEEN THE PART PLAYED BY PORTHOS IN THE DUEL IT HAD NOT MADE HIM FORGET THE DINNER OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE ON THE MORROW HE RECEIVED THE LAST TOUCHES OF MOUSQUETON'S BRUSH FOR AN HOUR
IT IS MY COUSIN CRIED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE COME IN COME IN MONSIEUR PORTHOS THE NAME OF PORTHOS PRODUCED ITS EFFECT UPON THE CLERKS WHO BEGAN TO LAUGH BUT PORTHOS TURNED SHARPLY ROUND
THE PROCURATOR HAD WITHOUT DOUBT BEEN WARNED OF HIS VISIT AS HE EXPRESSED NO SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF PORTHOS WHO ADVANCED TOWARD HIM WITH A SUFFICIENTLY EASY AIR AND SALUTED HIM COURTEOUSLY
OH NO SAID PORTHOS IT DOES NOT EXCEED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LIVRES I EVEN THINK THAT WITH ECONOMY I COULD MANAGE IT WITH TWO THOUSAND LIVRES GOOD GOD CRIED SHE TWO THOUSAND LIVRES
AND TWICE OR THREE TIMES HE EVEN SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON INTERCEPT THE LIGHT AT LENGTH A HAND AND AN ARM SURPASSINGLY BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR FORM AND WHITENESS GLIDED THROUGH THE TAPESTRY
AND HIS HIGHNESS MONSIEUR WITH THE QUEEN THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND THE BALLET BEGAN THE KING DANCED FACING THE QUEEN AND EVERY TIME HE PASSED BY HER HE DEVOURED WITH HIS EYES THOSE STUDS OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ASCERTAIN THE NUMBER
THE HASTE WHICH THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS IN TO CONVEY TO THE QUEEN THE EXCELLENT NEWS OF THE HAPPY RETURN OF HER MESSENGER PREVENTED THE TWO LOVERS FROM EXCHANGING MORE THAN A FEW WORDS
THE VOICE OF THE KING WAS TREMULOUS WITH ANGER EVERYBODY LOOKED AND LISTENED WITH ASTONISHMENT COMPREHENDING NOTHING OF WHAT PASSED SIRE SAID THE QUEEN
WELL AGREED FOR A PRETTY MULE SAID PORTHOS YOU ARE RIGHT I HAVE SEEN VERY GREAT SPANISH NOBLES WHOSE WHOLE SUITE WERE MOUNTED ON MULES BUT THEN YOU UNDERSTAND MADAME COQUENARD A MULE WITH FEATHERS AND BELLS
IN THEIR UTMOST NICETY AND WINNING FROM THEM BY WAY OF FEE FOR THE LESSON HE WOULD GIVE THEM IN AN HOUR THEIR SAVINGS OF A MONTH ALL THIS WAS ENORMOUSLY DELIGHTFUL TO PORTHOS
A HORSE FOR YOUR LACKEY RESUMED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE HESITATINGLY
SMILED A LITTLE AND COLORED A GREAT DEAL
AN ILL SMELLING DARK PASSAGE A STAIRCASE HALF LIGHTED BY BARS THROUGH WHICH STOLE A GLIMMER FROM A NEIGHBORING YARD ON THE FIRST FLOOR A LOW DOOR STUDDED WITH ENORMOUS NAILS
IN FACT THE KING COUNTED THEM AND THE TWELVE STUDS WERE ALL ON HER MAJESTY'S SHOULDER THE KING CALLED THE CARDINAL WHAT DOES THIS MEAN MONSIEUR CARDINAL ASKED THE KING IN A SEVERE TONE THIS MEANS SIRE REPLIED THE CARDINAL
AND TWENTY VIOLINS WERE ORDERED AND THE PRICE FOR THEM FIXED AT DOUBLE THE USUAL RATE UPON CONDITION SAID THE REPORT THAT THEY SHOULD BE PLAYED ALL NIGHT
HIS HEART BEAT BUT NOT LIKE D'ARTAGNAN'S WITH A YOUNG AND IMPATIENT LOVE NO A MORE MATERIAL INTEREST STIRRED HIS BLOOD HE WAS ABOUT AT LAST TO PASS THAT MYSTERIOUS THRESHOLD
THE YOUNG MEN FILLED UP THEIR THIRD OF A GLASS WITH WATER THEN WHEN THEY HAD DRUNK HALF THE GLASS THEY FILLED IT UP AGAIN AND CONTINUED TO DO SO THIS BROUGHT THEM BY THE END OF THE REPAST TO SWALLOWING A DRINK
ON HIS PART THE KING RETURNED TO HIS APARTMENT THERE WAS A MOMENT OF TROUBLE AND CONFUSION IN THE ASSEMBLY EVERYBODY HAD REMARKED THAT SOMETHING HAD PASSED BETWEEN THE KING AND QUEEN BUT BOTH OF THEM HAD SPOKEN SO LOW THAT EVERYBODY
TAKE MY ADVICE DON'T TOUCH THEM DEVIL TAKE ME IF I TASTE ONE OF THEM MURMURED PORTHOS TO HIMSELF AND THEN SAID ALOUD THANK YOU MY COUSIN I AM NO LONGER HUNGRY THERE WAS SILENCE PORTHOS COULD HARDLY KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE
THEN CONTINUED HE THERE IS A HORSE FOR MY LACKEY AND MY VALISE
WHY MADAME HAVE YOU NOT THOUGHT PROPER TO WEAR YOUR DIAMOND STUDS WHEN YOU KNOW IT WOULD GIVE ME SO MUCH GRATIFICATION THE QUEEN CAST A GLANCE AROUND HER AND SAW THE CARDINAL BEHIND WITH A DIABOLICAL SMILE ON HIS COUNTENANCE
THE TIME FOR WINE CAME
AND WHICH WERE ALL ILLUMINATED WITH COLORED LANTERNS
AND YET AT THE VERY DOOR THE MUSKETEER BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN SOME DOUBTS THE APPROACH WAS NOT SUCH AS TO PREPOSSESS PEOPLE
ON THE EVENING BEFORE THEY HAD SCARCELY SEEN EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT AT THE APARTMENT OF THE SWISS GUARD GERMAIN WHITHER D'ARTAGNAN HAD SENT FOR HER
THIS TIME PORTHOS RECEIVED THE BLOW RIGHT IN HIS STOMACH AND FELT IT
AT SIX IN THE EVENING THE GUESTS BEGAN TO COME AS FAST AS THEY ENTERED THEY WERE PLACED IN THE GRAND SALOON ON THE PLATFORMS PREPARED FOR THEM AT NINE O'CLOCK MADAME LA PREMIERE PRESIDENTE ARRIVED
PORTHOS MADE A MOST SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE
FINALLY THE REST OF THE EQUIPMENT WAS SUCCESSIVELY DEBATED IN THE SAME MANNER
UPON THE EDGE OF WHICH FOR STILL GREATER PRECAUTION HE PLACED HIS FEET THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE TOOK PORTHOS INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM AND THEY BEGAN TO LAY THE BASIS OF A RECONCILIATION YOU CAN COME AND DINE THREE TIMES A WEEK
YOU AT LAST CRIED D'ARTAGNAN SILENCE SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN PLACING HER HAND UPON HIS LIPS SILENCE AND GO THE SAME WAY YOU CAME BUT WHERE AND WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN CRIED D'ARTAGNAN
AFTER THE SOUP THE MAID BROUGHT A BOILED FOWL A PIECE OF MAGNIFICENCE WHICH CAUSED THE EYES OF THE DINERS TO DILATE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY SEEMED READY TO BURST
THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE WAITED TREMBLINGLY TO HOW MUCH SAID SHE I HOPE IT DOES NOT EXCEED SHE STOPPED
PORTHOS SMILED IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD THE SADDLE WHICH CAME FROM BUCKINGHAM
TO FALL INTO THE EASIEST POSITION IN HIS CORNER AND TO SLEEP WHETHER WELL OR ILL D'ARTAGNAN BE IT REMEMBERED WAS ONLY TWENTY YEARS OLD AND AT THAT AGE SLEEP HAS ITS IMPRESCRIPTIBLE RIGHTS WHICH IT IMPERIOUSLY INSISTS UPON EVEN WITH THE SADDEST HEARTS
HE HASTENED TO DESCEND INTO THE STREET WITH A FRIGHTFUL BEATING AT HIS HEART HE WISHED TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND OTHER TRACES OF VIOLENCE THE LITTLE SOFT LIGHT SHONE ON IN THE CALMNESS OF THE NIGHT D'ARTAGNAN THEN PERCEIVED A THING THAT HE HAD NOT BEFORE REMARKED
SILENT AND OBSCURE WHICH HAD NO DOUBT SEEN ALL AND COULD TELL ITS TALE THE GATE OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS SHUT BUT HE LEAPED OVER THE HEDGE AND IN SPITE OF THE BARKING OF A CHAINED UP DOG WENT UP TO THE CABIN NO ONE ANSWERED TO HIS FIRST KNOCKING
HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE LITTLE PAVILION SITUATED AT THE ANGLE OF THE WALL OF WHICH ALL THE WINDOWS WERE CLOSED WITH SHUTTERS EXCEPT ONE ON THE FIRST STORY THROUGH THIS WINDOW SHONE A MILD LIGHT
YES MONSIEUR THE ONE WITH WHICH I GATHER MY FRUIT
THE TREE WAS EASY TO CLIMB BESIDES D'ARTAGNAN WAS BUT TWENTY YEARS OLD AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN HIS SCHOOLBOY HABITS IN AN INSTANT HE WAS AMONG THE BRANCHES AND HIS KEEN EYES PLUNGED THROUGH THE TRANSPARENT PANES INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE PAVILION
HE TOLD HOW HE HAD A RENDEZVOUS WITH A YOUNG WOMAN BEFORE THAT PAVILION AND HOW NOT SEEING HER COME HE HAD CLIMBED THE LINDEN TREE AND BY THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP HAD SEEN THE DISORDER OF THE CHAMBER THE OLD MAN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
WAS OF IRREPROACHABLE ODOR IT WAS ONE OF THOSE PERFUMED GLOVES THAT LOVERS LIKE TO SNATCH FROM A PRETTY HAND AS D'ARTAGNAN PURSUED HIS INVESTIGATIONS A MORE ABUNDANT AND MORE ICY SWEAT ROLLED IN LARGE DROPS FROM HIS FOREHEAD
RECURRING TO HIS BESETTING IDEA THAT MONSIEUR BONACIEUX HAS SOMETHING VICIOUS IN HIS EYEBROWS AND SOMETHING VERY UNPLEASANT IN THE PLAY OF HIS LIPS WHAT THE DEVIL MAKES YOU THINK OF BONACIEUX MONSIEUR WE THINK OF WHAT WE CAN
THAT WOODS ARE LIKE CHURCHES
HE AGAIN RAN BACK TO THE CHATEAU
WHICH SILVERED THE FOLIAGE OF TWO OR THREE LINDEN TREES WHICH FORMED A GROUP OUTSIDE THE PARK THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT BEHIND THIS LITTLE WINDOW WHICH THREW FORTH SUCH FRIENDLY BEAMS
TEN STROKES FROM ITS SONOROUS JAWS THERE WAS SOMETHING MELANCHOLY IN THIS BRAZEN VOICE POURING OUT ITS LAMENTATIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BUT EACH OF THOSE STROKES WHICH MADE UP THE EXPECTED HOUR VIBRATED HARMONIOUSLY TO THE HEART OF THE YOUNG MAN
THE LEADER CLOSED THE WINDOW CAME OUT AN INSTANT AFTER BY THE DOOR AND SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THE WOMAN WAS IN THE CARRIAGE HIS TWO COMPANIONS WERE ALREADY ON HORSEBACK HE SPRANG INTO HIS SADDLE THE LACKEY TOOK HIS PLACE BY THE COACHMAN
THE BELFRY OF SAINT CLOUD SOUNDED HALF PAST TEN THIS TIME WITHOUT KNOWING WHY D'ARTAGNAN FELT A COLD SHIVER RUN THROUGH HIS VEINS PERHAPS THE COLD BEGAN TO AFFECT HIM AND HE TOOK A PERFECTLY PHYSICAL SENSATION FOR A MORAL IMPRESSION
HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS THREE TIMES THE ORDINARY SIGNAL OF LOVERS BUT NOBODY REPLIED TO HIM NOT EVEN AN ECHO HE THEN THOUGHT WITH A TOUCH OF VEXATION THAT PERHAPS THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WHILE WAITING FOR HIM HE APPROACHED THE WALL AND TRIED TO CLIMB IT
TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN
AFTER HAVING CAST A GLANCE BEHIND IT BEYOND THAT HEDGE THAT GARDEN AND THAT COTTAGE A DARK MIST ENVELOPED WITH ITS FOLDS THAT IMMENSITY WHERE PARIS SLEPT A VAST VOID FROM WHICH GLITTERED A FEW LUMINOUS POINTS THE FUNERAL STARS OF THAT HELL
HE IS MY DEMON APPARENTLY AND THE OTHER WHICH THE SHORT ONE OH HE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN I'LL ANSWER FOR IT BESIDES HE DID NOT WEAR A SWORD AND THE OTHERS TREATED HIM WITH SMALL CONSIDERATION SOME LACKEY MURMURED D'ARTAGNAN
THEN I SAW NO MORE BUT I HEARD THE NOISE OF BREAKING FURNITURE THE WOMAN SCREAMED AND CRIED FOR HELP BUT HER CRIES WERE SOON STIFLED TWO OF THE MEN APPEARED BEARING THE WOMAN IN THEIR ARMS AND CARRIED HER TO THE CARRIAGE INTO WHICH THE LITTLE OLD MAN GOT AFTER HER
AND NO ONE COULD FIND FAULT WITH IT AH MONSIEUR
D'ARTAGNAN WENT SUCCESSIVELY INTO ALL THE CABARETS IN WHICH THERE WAS A LIGHT
MAKING A SIGN ONLY THAT IT WAS ALL SO AND THEN WHEN D'ARTAGNAN HAD ENDED HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH AN AIR THAT ANNOUNCED NOTHING GOOD WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED D'ARTAGNAN
EVERYTHING IN THE APARTMENT GAVE EVIDENCE OF A VIOLENT AND DESPERATE STRUGGLE D'ARTAGNAN EVEN FANCIED HE COULD RECOGNIZE AMID THIS STRANGE DISORDER FRAGMENTS OF GARMENTS AND SOME BLOODY SPOTS STAINING THE CLOTH AND THE CURTAINS
OH IF I HAD MY THREE FRIENDS HERE CRIED HE I SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST SOME HOPES OF FINDING HER BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT HAS BECOME OF THEM IT WAS PAST MIDNIGHT
OH IT'S A DESCRIPTION YOU WANT EXACTLY SO A TALL DARK MAN WITH BLACK MUSTACHES DARK EYES
WRAPPED IN THIS SWEET IDEA D'ARTAGNAN WAITED HALF AN HOUR WITHOUT THE LEAST IMPATIENCE HIS EYES FIXED UPON THAT CHARMING LITTLE ABODE OF WHICH HE COULD PERCEIVE A PART OF THE CEILING WITH ITS GILDED MOLDINGS ATTESTING THE ELEGANCE OF THE REST OF THE APARTMENT
FOR YOU WILL LOOK AND YOU WILL LISTEN I AM QUITE SURE HOWEVER WE MAY THREATEN YOU YOU ARE LOST AT THESE WORDS HE THREW ME A CROWN WHICH I PICKED UP AND HE TOOK THE LADDER AFTER SHUTTING THE GATE BEHIND THEM I PRETENDED TO RETURN TO THE HOUSE
BECAUSE WE DARE NOT SPEAK ALOUD IN ONE OR THE OTHER BUT WHY DID YOU NOT DARE TO SPEAK ALOUD PLANCHET BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID AFRAID OF BEING HEARD YES MONSIEUR AFRAID OF BEING HEARD
AND THAT FRESH INFORMATION AWAITED HIM THE LANE WAS STILL DESERTED
AS SOON AS HE HAD LOST SIGHT OF HIS MASTER AND IN SUCH HASTE WAS HE TO WARM HIMSELF THAT HE WENT STRAIGHT TO A HOUSE SET OUT WITH ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF A SUBURBAN TAVERN AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
THE OLD MAN READ SO MUCH TRUTH AND SO MUCH GRIEF IN THE FACE OF THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE MADE HIM A SIGN TO LISTEN AND REPEATED IN A LOW VOICE IT WAS SCARCELY NINE O'CLOCK WHEN I HEARD A NOISE IN THE STREET AND WAS WONDERING WHAT IT COULD BE
BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE EXERCISE AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNEQUAL PRESSURE ON OUR GOVERNMENT ONE CLASS OF OUR CITIZENS CLAMORS FOR TREATIES IMPOSSIBLE OF FULFILMENT AND IMPROPER TO FULFIL
EITHER TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS AGAINST THEIR OWN CITIZENS OR TO PROTECT THEIR OWN CITIZENS AGAINST FOREIGNERS THAT IT BECOMES A MATTER OF SHEER DUTY FOR SOME OUTSIDE POWER TO INTERFERE IN CONNECTION WITH THEM
THEY GO WRONG AT THE OUTSET FOR THEY LAY ALL THE EMPHASIS ON PEACE AND NONE AT ALL ON RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THEM PHYSICALLY TIMID MEN BUT THEY ARE USUALLY MEN
YOU SEE WAITING GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR CAME INTO THE MAIN STREET OF WINESBURG THE LIGHTS FROM THE STORE WINDOWS LAY BRIGHT AND SHINING ON THE SIDEWALKS PEOPLE MOVED ABOUT LAUGHING AND TALKING
YET AMIABLE BUT FATUOUS PERSONS WITH ALL THESE FACTS BEFORE THEIR EYES PASS RESOLUTIONS DEMANDING UNIVERSAL ARBITRATION FOR EVERYTHING
OR HER I JUST SENT HER HOME TO HER MOTHER AND SAID NOTHING THERE WAS NOTHING TO SAY I HAD FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE BANK AND I GAVE HER THAT I DIDN'T ASK HER REASONS
ALREADY YOU MAY BE HAVING DREAMS IN YOUR HEAD
LOOKING BACK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A SCORE OF YEARS PROBABLY EVERY ONE WILL AGREE THAT HE WAS AN ABSURD PERSON BUT HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT MORE ABSURD THAN MOST OF THE MORE PROMINENT PERSONS WHO ADVOCATE DISARMAMENT BY THE UNITED STATES
TO THEIR COUNTRY AND TO MANKIND THAN THOSE WHO EXALT UNRIGHTEOUS PEACE AS BETTER THAN RIGHTEOUS WAR THE MEN WHO HAVE STOOD HIGHEST IN OUR HISTORY AS IN THE HISTORY OF ALL COUNTRIES ARE THOSE WHO SCORNED INJUSTICE
THAT MADE HIS WORDS SEEM THE MORE TERRIBLE IN THE DARKNESS THE YOUNG REPORTER FOUND HIMSELF IMAGINING THAT HE SAT ON THE RAILROAD TIES BESIDE A COMELY YOUNG MAN WITH BLACK HAIR AND BLACK SHINING EYES
WHEN WASH WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS SUCH A ONE HAD AN INSTINCT TO PAY HIM HOMAGE TO RAISE HIS HAT OR TO BOW BEFORE HIM THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD SUPERVISION OVER THE TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
SHE WAS A FOUL THING COME OUT A WOMAN MORE FOUL SHE WAS A THING SENT TO MAKE LIFE UNBEARABLE TO ME I WAS A FOOL DO YOU SEE AS YOU ARE NOW AND SO I MARRIED THIS WOMAN
INTERMINGLED WITH STRINGS OF VILE CURSES THE OPERATOR HAD MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A DENTIST WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THREE SISTERS ON HIS MARRIAGE DAY BECAUSE OF HIS ABILITY HE WAS PROMOTED TO A POSITION AS DISPATCHER
HIS NECK THIN HIS LEGS FEEBLE HE WAS DIRTY EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS UNCLEAN EVEN THE WHITES OF HIS EYES LOOKED SOILED I GO TOO FAST NOT EVERYTHING ABOUT WASH WAS UNCLEAN
WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERT OF BIG POWERS TO PREVENT THE BREAKING OF THIS PEACE ALTHOUGH ONLY BY BREAKING IT COULD THE OUTRAGES BE STOPPED BE IT REMEMBERED THAT THE PEOPLES WHO SUFFERED BY THESE HIDEOUS MASSACRES WHO SAW THEIR WOMEN VIOLATED
SHE WROTE ME A LETTER AND ASKED ME TO COME TO THEIR HOUSE AT DAYTON WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS EVENING ABOUT THIS TIME WASH WILLIAMS VOICE ROSE TO A HALF SCREAM
THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
IN ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON BUT AS THEY WALKED ABOUT UNDER THE TREES THEY OCCASIONALLY EMBRACED THE NIGHT AND THEIR OWN THOUGHTS HAD AROUSED SOMETHING IN THEM AS THEY WERE RETURNING TO MAIN STREET THEY PASSED THE LITTLE LAWN
LATE IN APRIL CAME THE PLANTING IN THE LITTLE PATHS AMONG THE SEED BEDS SHE STOOD HOLDING A PAPER BAG IN HER HAND THE BAG WAS FILLED WITH SEEDS A FEW AT A TIME SHE HANDED ME THE SEEDS
IN THE FEELING FOR INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND JUSTICE AMONG THE GREAT CIVILIZED NATIONS DURING THE PAST THREESCORE OR FOURSCORE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REAL GROWTH OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT
THE GIRL WAS ASHAMED AND STOOD PERFECTLY STILL STARING AT THE FLOOR THE MOTHER DIDN'T COME INTO THE ROOM WHEN SHE HAD PUSHED THE GIRL IN THROUGH THE DOOR SHE STOOD IN THE HALLWAY WAITING HOPING WE WOULD WELL
OF OUTSIDERS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE POWER TO FIGHT JAPAN STANDS ON A FOOTING OF EQUALITY WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN NATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES POSSESS THIS POWER CHINA NOW SEES JAPAN
ALMOST EVERY GREAT NATION HAS INHERITED CERTAIN QUESTIONS EITHER WITH OTHER NATIONS OR WITH SECTIONS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE WHICH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CIVILIZATION TO DECIDE
PAST THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE UP ALONG MAIN STREET HE WENT IN THE EVENING TO ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON AND AFTER DRINKING UNBELIEVABLE QUANTITIES OF BEER STAGGERED OFF TO HIS ROOM IN THE NEW WILLARD HOUSE AND TO HIS BED FOR THE NIGHT
THE YOUNG REPORTER FELT ILL AND WEAK IN IMAGINATION HE ALSO BECAME OLD AND SHAPELESS I DIDN'T GET THE MOTHER KILLED SAID WASH WILLIAMS STARING UP AND DOWN THE STREET I STRUCK HER ONCE WITH A CHAIR
FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
WASH WILLIAMS WAS A MAN OF COURAGE A THING HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THAT MADE HIM HATE LIFE AND HE HATED IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH THE ABANDON OF A POET FIRST OF ALL HE HATED WOMEN
THE CESSATION OF UP BUILDING THE NAVY AND THE PROMISE TO AGREE TO ARBITRATE ALL MATTERS INCLUDING THOSE AFFECTING OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AND HONOR WITH ALL FOREIGN NATIONS THESE PERSONS WOULD DO NO HARM
BUT HATE AS IT WILL IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AHAB DID NOT LIKE MICAIAH BECAUSE HE NEVER PROPHESIED GOOD CONCERNING HIM BUT EVIL
SAID FELIX OMINOUSLY THEY TELL ME THAT YOU'VE BEEN PRAYING RIGHT ALONG THAT I COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE NOW I TELL YOU
GAMBLING WHAT WOULD AUNT JANE SAY IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO FIGHT CECILY DEMANDED OF PETER DON'T YOU DRAG MY AUNT JANE INTO THIS AFFAIR SAID PETER DARKLY YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE A PRESBYTERIAN
CECILY KEEP QUIET NOW ONE TWO THREE PETER AND FELIX PITCHED IN WITH MORE ZEAL THAN DISCRETION ON BOTH SIDES AS A RESULT PETER GOT WHAT LATER DEVELOPED INTO A BLACK EYE AND FELIX'S NOSE BEGAN TO BLEED
I MOUNTED INTO THE WINDOW SEAT GATHERING UP MY FEET I SAT CROSS LEGGED LIKE A TURK AND HAVING DRAWN THE RED MOREEN CURTAIN NEARLY CLOSE I WAS SHRINED IN DOUBLE RETIREMENT
BUT CONTINUALLY EVERY NERVE I HAD FEARED HIM AND EVERY MORSEL OF FLESH IN MY BONES SHRANK WHEN HE CAME NEAR THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I WAS BEWILDERED BY THE TERROR HE INSPIRED
EVEN IF YOU WAS BROUGHT UP IN TORONTO I S'POSE YOU THINK A HIRED BOY HASN'T ANY BUSINESS TO PRAY FOR PARTICULAR THINGS BUT I'LL SHOW YOU I'LL JUST PRAY FOR WHAT I PLEASE AND I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY AND STOP ME
SHE NOW CAME UPON THE SCENE FOLLOWED BY BESSIE AND HER MAID ABBOT
AT THIS MOMENT A LIGHT GLEAMED ON THE WALL WAS IT I ASKED MYSELF A RAY FROM THE MOON PENETRATING SOME APERTURE IN THE BLIND NO MOONLIGHT WAS STILL AND THIS STIRRED
OR RATHER OUT OF MYSELF AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT A MOMENT'S MUTINY HAD ALREADY RENDERED ME LIABLE TO STRANGE PENALTIES AND LIKE ANY OTHER REBEL SLAVE I FELT RESOLVED IN MY DESPERATION TO GO ALL LENGTHS
THE OTHER FELLOW I SAID WITH RELUCTANT HONESTY WELL SAID THE STORY GIRL I THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU GET WHIPPED OR NOT SO LONG AS YOU FIGHT A GOOD SQUARE FIGHT
BE SEATED SOMEWHERE AND UNTIL YOU CAN SPEAK PLEASANTLY REMAIN SILENT A BREAKFAST ROOM ADJOINED THE DRAWING ROOM I SLIPPED IN THERE IT CONTAINED A BOOKCASE I SOON POSSESSED MYSELF OF A VOLUME
AND THITHER WE ALL RESORTED AT SUNSET I HOPE FELIX WILL BEAT SAID THE STORY GIRL TO ME NOT ONLY FOR THE FAMILY HONOUR BUT BECAUSE THAT WAS A MEAN MEAN PRAYER OF PETER'S DO YOU THINK HE WILL I DON'T KNOW
HE HAD NOT FELT VERY KEENLY OVER THE MATTER OF THE SERMONS AND CERTAINLY THE MERE FACT THAT PETER COULD EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT MAKING FACES DID NOT CAST ANY REFLECTION ON THE HONOUR OR ABILITY OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS
MY HEAD STILL ACHED AND BLED WITH THE BLOW AND FALL I HAD RECEIVED NO ONE HAD REPROVED JOHN FOR WANTONLY STRIKING ME AND BECAUSE I HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM TO AVERT FARTHER IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE
I DWELT ON IT WITH GATHERING DREAD I COULD NOT REMEMBER HIM BUT I KNEW THAT HE WAS MY OWN UNCLE
MEN TOO OFTEN CONFOUND THEM THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONFOUNDED APPEARANCE SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR TRUTH NARROW HUMAN DOCTRINES THAT ONLY TEND TO ELATE AND MAGNIFY A FEW SHOULD NOT BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE WORLD REDEEMING CREED OF CHRIST
TELL MAMA SHE IS RUN OUT INTO THE RAIN BAD ANIMAL IT IS WELL I DREW THE CURTAIN THOUGHT I AND I WISHED FERVENTLY HE MIGHT NOT DISCOVER MY HIDING PLACE NOR WOULD JOHN REED HAVE FOUND IT OUT HIMSELF HE WAS NOT QUICK
PERSISTED CECILY GOOD PRESBYTERIANS DON'T FIGHT OH DON'T THEY I HEARD YOUR UNCLE ROGER SAY THAT PRESBYTERIANS WERE THE BEST FOR FIGHTING IN THE WORLD OR THE WORST I FORGET WHICH HE SAID BUT IT MEANS THE SAME THING
EACH PICTURE TOLD A STORY MYSTERIOUS OFTEN TO MY UNDEVELOPED UNDERSTANDING AND IMPERFECT FEELINGS YET EVER PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING AS INTERESTING AS THE TALES BESSIE SOMETIMES NARRATED ON WINTER EVENINGS
I WIPED MY TEARS AND HUSHED MY SOBS FEARFUL LEST ANY SIGN OF VIOLENT GRIEF MIGHT WAKEN A PRETERNATURAL VOICE TO COMFORT ME OR ELICIT FROM THE GLOOM SOME HALOED FACE BENDING OVER ME WITH STRANGE PITY
AND COULD DISCOVER BY HER OWN OBSERVATION THAT I WAS ENDEAVOURING IN GOOD EARNEST TO ACQUIRE A MORE SOCIABLE AND CHILDLIKE DISPOSITION A MORE ATTRACTIVE AND SPRIGHTLY MANNER SOMETHING LIGHTER FRANKER MORE NATURAL AS IT WERE
A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF JANE EYRE BEING UNNECESSARY I GAVE NONE THIS SECOND EDITION DEMANDS A FEW WORDS BOTH OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS REMARK MY THANKS ARE DUE IN THREE QUARTERS
WHEN SHE CHANCED TO BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AND WHEN HAVING BROUGHT HER IRONING TABLE TO THE NURSERY HEARTH SHE ALLOWED US TO SIT ABOUT IT AND WHILE SHE GOT UP MISSUS REED'S LACE FRILLS AND CRIMPED HER NIGHTCAP BORDERS
A SINGULAR NOTION DAWNED UPON ME I DOUBTED NOT NEVER DOUBTED THAT IF MISTER REED HAD BEEN ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE TREATED ME KINDLY
AFTER THAT NO MORAL FORCE ON EARTH COULD HAVE PREVENTED FELIX FROM FIGHTING HE WOULD HAVE FACED AN ARMY WITH BANNERS YOU MIGHT SETTLE IT BY DRAWING LOTS SAID CECILY DESPERATELY DRAWING LOTS IS WICKEDER THAT FIGHTING SAID DAN
A NOXIOUS THING CHERISHING THE GERMS OF INDIGNATION AT THEIR TREATMENT OF CONTEMPT OF THEIR JUDGMENT I KNOW THAT HAD I BEEN A SANGUINE BRILLIANT CARELESS EXACTING HANDSOME ROMPING CHILD THOUGH EQUALLY DEPENDENT AND FRIENDLESS
I REALLY SAW IN HIM A TYRANT A MURDERER I FELT A DROP OR TWO OF BLOOD FROM MY HEAD TRICKLE DOWN MY NECK AND WAS SENSIBLE OF SOMEWHAT PUNGENT SUFFERING THESE SENSATIONS FOR THE TIME PREDOMINATED OVER FEAR AND I RECEIVED HIM IN FRANTIC SORT
AND HUMBLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY PHYSICAL INFERIORITY TO ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA REED THE SAID ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA WERE NOW CLUSTERED ROUND THEIR MAMA IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE LAY RECLINED ON A SOFA BY THE FIRESIDE
GROWLED THE WOLF SPRINGING UP SUDDENLY AT RED RIDING HOOD BUT JUST AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND TWO TALL WOOD CUTTERS
WHICH MAKES THEM MORE SOMETHING OR OTHERISH STILL THERE IS NO OTHER WORD FOR IT A GIRL IS A COMPLICATED THING IT IS MADE UP OF CLOTHES SMILES A POMPADOUR THINGS OF WHICH SPACE AND PRUDENCE FORBID THE ENUMERATION HERE
CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE APHORISM ARE SELDOM COUCHED IN SUCH TERMS THAT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS THEY SOUND PRECISELY OR ACCORDING TO THE WIDEST EXTENT OF SIGNIFICATION BUT DO COMMONLY NEED EXPOSITION AND ADMIT EXCEPTION
TO A HANDSOME COMFORTABLE DINNER SERVICE OF PLATE NOT INCLUDING PLATES FOR I HOLD SILVER PLATES TO BE SHEER WANTONNESS AND WOULD ALMOST AS SOON THINK OF SILVER TEACUPS A COUPLE OF NEAT TEAPOTS A COFFEEPOT
TO PROVE HERSELF WHOLE HEARTED FOR OF COURSE ALWAYS EVERY SUITOR EXPECTS WHOLE HEARTEDNESS AND THIS EVERY GIRL INSTINCTIVELY KNOWS INDEED IS NOT A HALF HEARTED LOVE OR A HALF HEARTED ACCEPTRESS OF LOVE A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS
WHEN THEY ASK US TO DINE IF IT BE PLEASANT TO DINE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AS ALL PERSONS WITH GOOD STOMACHS AND KINDLY HEARTS WILL I PRESUME ALLOW IT TO BE IT IS BETTER TO DINE TWICE THAN TO DINE ONCE
THE PRINCIPAL TONE NEXT THE HIGHEST TONE THIRD
IS SOMETIMES CALLED A TRANSIENT SHAKE BECAUSE IT IS REALLY ONLY A PART OF THE MORE ELABORATE GRACE CALLED TRILL
THAN THEY ARE OF ONE ANOTHER WHICH IS VERY LUCKY FOR THE MEN GIRLS DIFFER AND THE SAME GIRL IS DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN SHE IS BY HERSELF SHE IS ONE THING WHEN SHE IS WITH OTHER GIRLS SHE IS ANOTHER THING WHEN SHE IS WITH A LOT OF MEN
IF SHE MAKE TEST OF MANY ADMIRERS SHE IS DESCRIBED AS A FLIRT IF CONSCIENTIOUS AND DEMURE SHE AWAIT HER FATE A DESIRABLE FATE IS BY NO MEANS ASSURED IN TRUTH IT SEEMS THAT TOO OFTEN A GIRL MUST DISSEMBLE
AND MY PLANS COULD BE CARRIED OUT DINNER GIVING WOULD INCREASE AS MUCH ON THE ONE HAND AS DINNER GIVING SNOBBISHNESS WOULD DIMINISH TO MY MIND THE MOST AMIABLE PART OF THE WORK LATELY PUBLISHED BY MY ESTEEMED FRIEND
AS THE ABBOT WAS RIDING UP THE LANE WHICH LED TO HIS GRAND HOUSE HE MET HIS SHEP HERD GOING TO THE FIELDS WELCOME HOME GOOD MASTER CRIED THE SHEPHERD WHAT NEWS DO YOU BRING US FROM GREAT KING JOHN
TO BE WOOED AND WEDDED IS THE LAW OF HER BEING YET NOT FOR ONE MOMENT DARES SHE TO EXHIBIT TOO GREAT AN ALACRITY TO OBEY THAT LAW FOR SHE KNOWS INSTINCTIVELY THAT AN EASY VICTORY PROGNOSTICATES A FICKLE VICTOR
AND ANOTHER BY SOMETHING UNNOTICED BY THE THRONG BUT AN SHE DISSEMBLES ONE IOTA TOO MUCH HER FELLOW FARERS LOOK ASKANCE AND HE WHO EVENTUALLY JOINS HER FOR GOOD UPBRAIDS HER FOR THAT BY WHICH SHE WON
AFTER THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT OUTSIDE AND ALL RED RIDING HOOD COULD SEE WAS THAT THE WINDOW CURTAINS AND THE BED CURTAINS WERE STILL DRAWN AND HER GRANDMOTHER SEEMED TO BE LYING IN BED WITH THE BED CLOTHES PULLED ALMOST OVER HER HEAD AND HER GREAT
THE MASCULINE MIND IS THE SLAVE OF LAW AND JUSTICE APHRODITE NEVER HEARD OF LAW OR JUSTICE SHE WAS BORN AT SEA THAT IS TO SAY FEW ARE THE MEN WHO AT SOME TIME IN THEIR LIVES HAVE NOT WONDERED AT THE VAGARIES
SHALL BE THE WINNER OF THE GAME SO THE WOLF TROTTED OFF ONE WAY AND RED RIDING HOOD WENT THE OTHER AND I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT SHE LINGERED AND LOITERED MORE THAN SHE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE ON THE ROAD WELL WHAT WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER
THE KING LAUGHED AGAIN INDEED HE SAID
AND ENTERTAIN EACH OTHER TO THE RUIN OF FRIENDSHIP LET ALONE HEALTH AND THE DESTRUCTION OF HOSPITALITY AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP YOU WHO BUT FOR THE PEACOCK'S TAIL MIGHT CHATTER AWAY SO MUCH AT YOUR EASE AND BE SO JOVIAL AND HAPPY
HATEFUL AS DISSEMBLANCE IN MEN T'IS A HARD ROAD INDEED THAT A GIRL HAS TO TRAVEL TO WIN HER A FELLOW FARER FOR LIFE SHE MUST GO OUT OF HER WAY TO ACCOMMODATE SO MANY TRAVELERS AND THIS ONE IS LURED BY THIS AND THAT ONE BY THAT
IS TAKEN FROM THAT OF THE MELODY TONE THE APPOGGIATURA WAS FORMERLY CLASSIFIED INTO LONG APPOGGIATURA
OFTEN ENOUGH THE FRECKLED AND FRINGRANT GIRL WINS OVER THE PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY SOMETIMES GROWN UP GIRLS ARE JUST AS SHY AS LITTLE ONES AND FOR THE SAME REASONS BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY WITH THEM GIRLS OFTEN PLAY WITH LOVE
YOU ARE VERY VERY KIND AND I HAVE A MIND TO LET YOU TRY YOUR PLAN BUT IF THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST YOU SHALL NOT DIE FOR ME I WILL DIE FOR MYSELF SO THE SHEPHERD GOT READY TO GO AT ONCE HE DRESSED HIMSELF WITH GREAT CARE
THAN A GIRL WITH NONE SHE KNOWS MORE OF MEN ESPECIALLY OF THEIR WEAKNESSES AND IDIOSYNCRASIES AND TO KNOW THE WEAKNESSES AND IDIOSYNCRASIES OF MEN IS PERHAPS A WIFE'S CHIEF TASK UNLESS IT BE TO PUT UP WITH THEM
HAVE SOUGHT FOR AND ASSERTED THE EXISTENCE OF THE IDEAL GIRL THIS IS SHEER NONSENSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AND IF THERE WERE SHE COULD NOT COMPARE WITH THE REAL GIRL
THROUGH THE COPSE AND DOWN THE HOLLOW AND OVER THE BRIDGE AND THREE MEADOWS AFTER THE MILL
SHE IS A THIRD SORT OF THING WHEN SHE IS WITH A MAN BUT THIS BAFFLED EVEN AGUR THE SON OF JAKEH AS A RULE A MAN PREFERS A GIRL BY HERSELF THIS IS NATURAL
AND SHRILL GENTEEL SCREAM O YOU MISGUIDED DINNER GIVING SNOBS THINK HOW MUCH PLEASURE YOU LOSE AND HOW MUCH MISCHIEF YOU DO WITH YOUR ABSURD GRANDEURS AND HYPOCRISIES YOU STUFF EACH OTHER WITH UNNATURAL FORCED MEATS
DOWN WHICH THEY SLIDE DURING THE DINNER TIME WAYLAYING THE DISHES AS THEY COME OUT AND FINGERING THE ROUND BUMPS ON THE JELLIES AND THE FORCED MEAT BALLS IN THE SOUP NOBODY I SAY SUPPOSES THAT A DINNER AT HOME IS CHARACTERIZED BY
I WISH I WERE AS CERTAIN OF FINDING ULYSSES RETURNED WHEN I GET BACK TO ITHACA THAT I MIGHT TELL HIM OF THE VERY GREAT KINDNESS YOU HAVE SHOWN ME AND OF THE MANY BEAUTIFUL PRESENTS I AM TAKING WITH ME
AND DISHEVELED BY THE WIND LONG BILLOWS MADE THE SUBMERSIBLE ROLL VERY NOTICEABLY AFTER RENEWING ITS AIR THE NAUTILUS STAYED AT AN AVERAGE DEPTH OF FIFTEEN METERS ENABLING IT TO RETURN QUICKLY TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
OUR PATH WAS BORDERED BY HOPELESSLY TANGLED BUSHES FORMED FROM SNARLS OF SHRUBS ALL COVERED WITH LITTLE STAR SHAPED WHITE STREAKED FLOWERS ONLY CONTRARY TO PLANTS ON SHORE THESE TREE FORMS BECOME ATTACHED TO ROCKS ON THE SEAFLOOR BY HEADING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
AFTER DRESSING THE POOR MAN'S WOUND I REDID THE LINEN BANDAGES AROUND HIS HEAD AND I TURNED TO CAPTAIN NEMO HOW DID HE GET THIS WOUND I ASKED HIM THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT THE CAPTAIN REPLIED EVASIVELY
I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE WOUNDED MAN THEN I REPLIED THIS MAN WILL BE DEAD IN TWO HOURS NOTHING CAN SAVE HIM NOTHING
I STOOD UP AND SAID TO HIM SO AS I PREDICTED THAT MAN DIED DURING THE NIGHT YES PROFESSOR ARONNAX CAPTAIN NEMO REPLIED AND NOW HE RESTS BESIDE HIS COMPANIONS IN THAT CORAL CEMETERY YES
CEREBRAL INFLAMMATION WAS COMPLETE AND HAD BROUGHT ON A PARALYSIS OF MOVEMENT AND SENSATION I TOOK THE WOUNDED MAN'S PULSE IT WAS INTERMITTENT
THE GOD WHO WATCHES OVER YOU AND PROTECTS YOU WILL SEND YOU A FAIR WIND AS SOON AS YOU GET TO ITHACA SEND YOUR SHIP AND MEN ON TO THE TOWN
I WILL MAKE VOWS TO YOU AS THOUGH YOU WERE A GOD EVEN WHEN I AM AT HOME AS HE SPOKE HE LASHED HIS HORSES AND THEY STARTED OFF AT FULL SPEED THROUGH THE TOWN TOWARDS THE OPEN COUNTRY THEY SWAYED THE YOKE UPON THEIR NECKS
FORGOTTEN BY THE WORLD BUT NOT BY US WE DIG THE GRAVES THEN ENTRUST THE POLYPS WITH SEALING AWAY OUR DEAD FOR ETERNITY AND WITH A SUDDEN GESTURE THE CAPTAIN HID HIS FACE IN HIS CLENCHED FISTS VAINLY TRYING TO HOLD BACK A SOB
AND TEARS SLID FROM HIS EYES WHICH I HAD THOUGHT INCAPABLE OF WEEPING FOR A FEW MOMENTS MORE I OBSERVED THE DYING MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS EBBING LITTLE BY LITTLE HE GREW STILL MORE PALE UNDER THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THAT BATHED HIS DEATHBED
THAT THEY MIGHT MAKE A DRINK OFFERING BEFORE THEY SET OUT HE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE HORSES AND PLEDGED THEM SAYING FAREWELL TO BOTH OF YOU SEE THAT YOU TELL NESTOR HOW I HAVE TREATED YOU
AND CONTRARY TO CUSTOM IT EXECUTED SUCH A MANEUVER SEVERAL TIMES DURING THAT DAY OF JANUARY NINETEENTH THE CHIEF OFFICER WOULD THEN CLIMB ONTO THE PLATFORM AND HIS USUAL PHRASE WOULD RING THROUGH THE SHIP'S INTERIOR
HE HADN'T COME INTO THE PICTURE I REJOINED NED LAND AND CONSEIL I INFORMED THEM OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S PROPOSITION CONSEIL WAS EAGER TO ACCEPT AND THIS TIME THE CANADIAN PROVED PERFECTLY AMENABLE TO GOING WITH US IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
AMID THESE SHRUBS OF PRECIOUS CORAL I OBSERVED OTHER POLYPS NO LESS UNUSUAL MELITA CORAL RAINBOW CORAL WITH JOINTED OUTGROWTHS THEN A FEW TUFTS OF GENUS CORALLINA SOME GREEN AND OTHERS RED
DO NOT THEREFORE TAKE ME PAST MY SHIP BUT LEAVE ME THERE FOR IF I GO TO YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE HE WILL TRY TO KEEP ME IN THE WARMTH OF HIS GOOD WILL TOWARDS ME AND I MUST GO HOME AT ONCE
I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE LATEST RESEARCH ON THIS BIZARRE ZOOPHYTE WHICH TURNS TO STONE WHILE TAKING ON A TREE FORM AS SOME NATURALISTS HAVE VERY APTLY OBSERVED
I WILL YOKE MY HORSES AND WILL CONDUCT YOU MYSELF THROUGH ALL OUR PRINCIPAL CITIES NO ONE WILL SEND US AWAY EMPTY HANDED EVERY ONE WILL GIVE US SOMETHING A BRONZE TRIPOD A COUPLE OF MULES OR A GOLD CUP
OUR LIGHTS PRODUCED A THOUSAND DELIGHTFUL EFFECTS WHILE PLAYING OVER THESE BRIGHTLY COLORED BOUGHS I FANCIED I SAW THESE CYLINDRICAL MEMBRANE FILLED TUBES TREMBLING BENEATH THE WATER'S UNDULATIONS I WAS TEMPTED TO GATHER THEIR FRESH PETALS
NED LAND OBSERVED THE SEA WITH HIS PENETRATING EYES IT WAS DESERTED THE CANADIAN SIGHTED NOTHING NEW ON THE HORIZON NEITHER SAIL NOR SHORE A BREEZE WAS BLOWING NOISILY FROM THE WEST
BUT AS TELEMACHUS WAS THUS BUSIED PRAYING ALSO AND SACRIFICING TO MINERVA IN THE SHIP'S STERN THERE CAME TO HIM A MAN FROM A DISTANT COUNTRY A SEER WHO WAS FLYING FROM ARGOS BECAUSE HE HAD KILLED A MAN HE WAS DESCENDED FROM MELAMPUS
FISH FLED HERE AND THERE AS THEIR RETREAT WAS DISTURBED I HEARD THE PICK RINGING ON THE LIMESTONE SOIL ITS IRON TIP SOMETIMES GIVING OFF SPARKS WHEN IT HIT A STRAY PIECE OF FLINT ON THE SEA BOTTOM THE HOLE GREW LONGER WIDER AND SOON
PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAPTAIN SAID TO ME WOULD YOU CONSENT TO GIVE YOUR MEDICAL ATTENTIONS TO ONE OF MY MEN SOMEONE IS SICK YES I'M READY TO GO WITH YOU COME
THE CORAL REALM THE NEXT DAY I WOKE UP WITH MY HEAD UNUSUALLY CLEAR MUCH TO MY SURPRISE I WAS IN MY STATEROOM
WITH ITS BRIGHT COLORS IT LIVED UP TO THOSE POETIC NAMES OF BLOOD FLOWER AND BLOOD FOAM THAT THE INDUSTRY CONFERS ON ITS FINEST EXHIBITS CORAL SELLS FOR AS MUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER KILOGRAM AND IN THIS LOCALITY
WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER THAT'S THE LAW FOR EVERYONE ON BOARD THE NAUTILUS BUT WHAT'S YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF HIS CONDITION I HESITATED TO SPEAK MY MIND YOU MAY TALK FREELY THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME THIS MAN DOESN'T UNDERSTAND FRENCH
WHY WERE WE IMPRISONED BEHIND THESE MASKS OF METAL AND GLASS WHY WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER AT LEAST LET US LEAD THE LIVES OF THE FISH THAT POPULATE THIS LIQUID ELEMENT OR BETTER YET THE LIVES OF AMPHIBIANS
WE STARED AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I WAS ABOUT TO WITNESS A STRANGE SCENE OBSERVING THE SEAFLOOR I SAW THAT IT SWELLED AT CERTAIN POINTS FROM LOW BULGES THAT WERE ENCRUSTED WITH LIMESTONE DEPOSITS
SHE NEARLY STRANGLED AND SAID IT WAS MOST UNCOMFORTABLE THIS MADE HER SORRY FOR THE CREATURES WHICH LIVE IN THERE WHICH SHE CALLS FISH FOR SHE CONTINUES TO FASTEN NAMES ON TO THINGS THAT DON'T NEED THEM AND DON'T COME WHEN THEY ARE CALLED BY THEM
AND MADE HER UNREASONABLE ABOUT EXPERIMENTS
THE NEW CREATURE SAYS IT IS ALL WOODS AND ROCKS AND SCENERY AND THEREFORE HAS NO RESEMBLANCE TO A GARDEN SAYS IT LOOKS LIKE A PARK AND DOES NOT LOOK LIKE ANYTHING BUT A PARK CONSEQUENTLY WITHOUT CONSULTING ME
BUT SHE HUNTED ME OUT BY MEANS OF A BEAST WHICH SHE HAS TAMED AND CALLS A WOLF AND CAME MAKING THAT PITIFUL NOISE AGAIN AND SHEDDING THAT WATER OUT OF THE PLACES SHE LOOKS WITH
I ESCAPED THAT NIGHT AND RODE A HORSE ALL NIGHT AS FAST AS HE COULD GO HOPING TO GET CLEAR OUT OF THE PARK AND HIDE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY BEFORE THE TROUBLE SHOULD BEGIN BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE
I WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT I HAD MADE ONE TO MYSELF THOUGH NOT ALOUD IT WAS THIS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE FALLS AND I SAID TO MYSELF HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO SEE THAT VAST BODY OF WATER TUMBLE DOWN THERE THEN IN AN INSTANT
SINCE THOSE FIRST DAYS WHEN IT WAS A FISH THE NEW ONE IS AS UGLY NOW AS THE OLD ONE WAS AT FIRST HAS THE SAME SULPHUR AND RAW MEAT COMPLEXION AND THE SAME SINGULAR HEAD WITHOUT ANY FUR ON IT SHE CALLS IT ABEL
WITH APPARENT SINCERITY AND TRUTH THAT THE SERPENT ASSURED HER THAT THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT WAS NOT APPLES IT WAS CHESTNUTS I SAID I WAS INNOCENT THEN FOR I HAD NOT EATEN ANY CHESTNUTS SHE SAID THE SERPENT INFORMED HER THAT CHESTNUT
AND EVERY BEAST WAS DESTROYING ITS NEIGHBOR I KNEW WHAT IT MEANT EVE HAD EATEN THAT FRUIT AND DEATH WAS COME INTO THE WORLD THE TIGERS ATE MY HORSE PAYING NO ATTENTION WHEN I ORDERED THEM TO DESIST
THAT IS WHAT SHE THINKS BUT THIS IS AN ERROR IN MY JUDGMENT THE DIFFERENCE IN SIZE WARRANTS THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS A DIFFERENT AND NEW KIND OF ANIMAL A FISH PERHAPS
ANOTHER THING SHE SAYS IT IS ORDERED THAT WE WORK FOR OUR LIVING HEREAFTER SHE WILL BE USEFUL I WILL SUPERINTEND TEN DAYS LATER SHE ACCUSES ME OF BEING THE CAUSE OF OUR DISASTER SHE SAYS
SEVERITY AND ORDERED HER TO GO AND GET SOME MORE AND NOT MAKE SUCH A SPECTACLE OF HERSELF SHE DID IT AND AFTER THIS WE CREPT DOWN TO WHERE THE WILD BEAST BATTLE HAD BEEN AND COLLECTED SOME SKINS AND I MADE HER PATCH TOGETHER A COUPLE OF SUITS PROPER FOR PUBLIC OCCASIONS
SUNDAY PULLED THROUGH THIS DAY IS GETTING TO BE MORE AND MORE TRYING IT WAS SELECTED AND SET APART LAST NOVEMBER AS A DAY OF REST I ALREADY HAD SIX OF THEM PER WEEK BEFORE
AND BETRAYS SORROW AND SOLICITUDE IN A HUNDRED WAYS
SINCE THEN I HAVE DECIPHERED SOME MORE OF ADAM'S HIEROGLYPHICS AND THINK HE HAS NOW BECOME SUFFICIENTLY IMPORTANT AS A PUBLIC CHARACTER TO JUSTIFY THIS PUBLICATION M T
SHE IS DETERMINED TO RUN US INTO ALL SORTS OF FOOLISH RISKS I THINK SHE WAS NOT LIKE THIS BEFORE SHE LOST HER MIND A FORTNIGHT LATER I EXAMINED ITS MOUTH THERE IS NO DANGER YET
BUT WILL PRESENTLY EMIGRATE AGAIN WHEN OCCASION OFFERS SHE ENGAGES HERSELF IN MANY FOOLISH THINGS AMONG OTHERS TRYING TO STUDY OUT WHY THE ANIMALS CALLED LIONS AND TIGERS LIVE ON GRASS AND FLOWERS WHEN AS SHE SAYS
ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER SUNUP AS I WAS RIDING THROUGH A FLOWERY PLAIN WHERE THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS WERE GRAZING SLUMBERING OR PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER ACCORDING TO THEIR WONT ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY BROKE INTO A TEMPEST OF FRIGHTFUL NOISES AND IN ONE MOMENT
TEN YEARS LATER THEY ARE BOYS WE FOUND IT OUT LONG AGO
BY MARK TWAIN NOTE I TRANSLATED A PORTION OF THIS DIARY SOME YEARS AGO AND A FRIEND OF MINE PRINTED A FEW COPIES IN AN INCOMPLETE FORM BUT THE PUBLIC NEVER GOT THEM
FOR A BEAR DOES NOT NEED A TAIL IN ORDER TO BE DANGEROUS FOUR MONTHS LATER
WHICH I DIDN'T BUT WENT AWAY IN MUCH HASTE I FOUND THIS PLACE OUTSIDE THE PARK AND WAS FAIRLY COMFORTABLE FOR A FEW DAYS BUT SHE HAS FOUND ME OUT FOUND ME OUT AND HAS NAMED THE PLACE TONAWANDA SAYS IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
BUT I CAUGHT A TRUE KANGAROO AND BROUGHT IT IN THINKING THAT THIS ONE BEING LONESOME WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT FOR COMPANY THAN HAVE NO KIN AT ALL
HER MIND IS DISORDERED EVERYTHING SHOWS IT SOMETIMES SHE CARRIES THE FISH IN HER ARMS HALF THE NIGHT WHEN IT COMPLAINS AND WANTS TO GET TO THE WATER AT SUCH TIMES THE WATER COMES OUT OF THE PLACES IN HER FACE THAT SHE LOOKS OUT OF AND SHE PATS THE FISH ON THE BACK AND MAKES SOFT SOUNDS WITH HER MOUTH TO SOOTHE IT
WHY I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW SAYS IT LOOKS LIKE NIAGARA FALLS THAT IS NOT A REASON IT IS MERE WAYWARDNESS AND IMBECILITY I GET NO CHANCE TO NAME ANYTHING MYSELF
WIPED IT AWAY WITH THE BACK OF ITS PAWS AND MADE A NOISE SUCH AS SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS MAKE WHEN THEY ARE IN DISTRESS I WISH IT WOULD NOT TALK IT IS ALWAYS TALKING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A CHEAP FLING AT THE POOR CREATURE A SLUR BUT I DO NOT MEAN IT SO
IT IS NOT A KANGAROO NO FOR IT SUPPORTS ITSELF BY HOLDING TO HER FINGER AND THUS GOES A FEW STEPS ON ITS HIND LEGS AND THEN FALLS DOWN IT IS PROBABLY SOME KIND OF A BEAR AND YET IT HAS NO TAIL AS YET AND NO FUR EXCEPT ON ITS HEAD
AND HAVING THE IMITATIVE FACULTY IN A HIGHLY DEVELOPED DEGREE I SHALL BE ASTONISHED IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE A NEW KIND OF PARROT
I AM LIKE TO LOSE MY MIND OVER THE CAPRICIOUS AND HARASSING DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS UNCLASSIFIABLE ZOOLOGICAL FREAK IF I COULD CATCH ANOTHER ONE BUT THAT IS HOPELESS IT IS A NEW VARIETY AND THE ONLY SAMPLE THIS IS PLAIN
FOR BEARS GET THEIR GROWTH EARLIER THAN THIS BEARS ARE DANGEROUS SINCE OUR CATASTROPHE
I SAID IT WAS SUPERFLUOUS THEN THE WORD EVIDENTLY RAISED ME IN ITS RESPECT AND INDEED IT IS A LARGE GOOD WORD AND WILL BEAR REPETITION
BUMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE REPLIED OBSTINATE PEOPLE MISTER SOWERBERRY VERY OBSTINATE PROUD TOO I'M AFRAID SIR
THE UNDERTAKER TURNED TO GO AWAY STOP STOP SAID THE OLD WOMAN IN A LOUD WHISPER WILL SHE BE BURIED TO MORROW OR NEXT DAY OR TO NIGHT
REFUSING TO PASS OTHERS TO ENCOURAGE THEIR MIGRATION HITHER AND RAISING THE CONDITIONS OF NEW APPROPRIATIONS OF LANDS
HE TWINED HIS HANDS IN HIS HAIR AND WITH A LOUD SCREAM ROLLED GROVELLING UPON THE FLOOR HIS EYES FIXED AND THE FOAM COVERING HIS LIPS
UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE SHOULD BE FIRMLY BOUND FOR SEVEN YEARS AND ALL DANGER OF HIS BEING RETURNED UPON THE HANDS OF THE PARISH SHOULD BE THUS EFFECTUALLY AND LEGALLY OVERCOME WELL SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY TAKING UP HIS HAT
COFFIN PLATES ELM CHIPS BRIGHT HEADED NAILS AND SHREDS OF BLACK CLOTH LAY SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR AND THE WALL BEHIND THE COUNTER WAS ORNAMENTED WITH A LIVELY REPRESENTATION OF TWO MUTES
OUR REPEATED PETITIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED ONLY BY REPEATED INJURY A PRINCE WHOSE CHARACTER IS THUS MARKED BY EVERY ACT WHICH MAY DEFINE A TYRANT IS UNFIT TO BE THE RULER OF A FREE PEOPLE
AND ALTERING FUNDAMENTALLY THE FORMS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS FOR SUSPENDING OUR OWN LEGISLATURES AND DECLARING THEMSELVES INVESTED WITH POWER TO LEGISLATE FOR US IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER HE HAS ABDICATED GOVERNMENT HERE
I LAID HER OUT AND I MUST WALK
COME THAT'S TOO MUCH OH IT'S SICKENING REPLIED THE BEADLE ANTIMONIAL MISTER SOWERBERRY SO IT IS ACQUIESCED THE UNDERTAKER WE ONLY HEARD OF THE FAMILY THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST SAID THE BEADLE
HE WAS ALONE IN A STRANGE PLACE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW CHILLED AND DESOLATE THE BEST OF US WILL SOMETIMES FEEL IN SUCH A SITUATION THE BOY HAD NO FRIENDS TO CARE FOR OR TO CARE FOR HIM
IS AN UNDISTINGUISHED DESTRUCTION OF ALL AGES SEXES AND CONDITIONS IN EVERY STAGE OF THESE OPPRESSIONS WE HAVE PETITIONED FOR REDRESS IN THE MOST HUMBLE TERMS
NOTHING WHEN YOU ARE USED TO IT MY BOY OLIVER WONDERED IN HIS OWN MIND WHETHER IT HAD TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME TO GET MISTER SOWERBERRY USED TO IT
AGAINST THE WALL WERE RANGED IN REGULAR ARRAY A LONG ROW OF ELM BOARDS CUT IN THE SAME SHAPE LOOKING IN THE DIM LIGHT LIKE HIGH SHOULDERED GHOSTS WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR BREECHES POCKETS
AND THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN HAVING READ AS MUCH OF THE BURIAL SERVICE AS COULD BE COMPRESSED INTO FOUR MINUTES GAVE HIS SURPLICE TO THE CLERK AND WALKED AWAY AGAIN NOW BILL SAID SOWERBERRY TO THE GRAVE DIGGER FILL UP IT WAS NO VERY
REPLIED OLIVER WITH CONSIDERABLE HESITATION NOT VERY MUCH SIR
THE OCCASION WAS NOT LONG IN COMING HALF AN HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING MISTER BUMBLE ENTERED THE SHOP AND SUPPORTING HIS CANE AGAINST THE COUNTER DREW FORTH HIS LARGE LEATHERN POCKET BOOK
SHOULDERED HIS SPADE AND WALKED OFF FOLLOWED BY THE BOYS WHO MURMURED VERY LOUD COMPLAINTS AT THE FUN BEING OVER SO SOON COME MY GOOD FELLOW SAID BUMBLE TAPPING THE MAN ON THE BACK THEY WANT TO SHUT UP THE YARD
ONLY A LOAF OF BREAD AND A CUP OF WATER SHALL WE HAVE SOME BREAD DEAR SHE SAID EAGERLY CATCHING AT THE UNDERTAKER'S COAT AS HE ONCE MORE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR
FOR THE PASSAGE OF A HUMAN BODY THE KENNEL WAS STAGNANT AND FILTHY THE VERY RATS WHICH HERE AND THERE LAY PUTREFYING IN ITS ROTTENNESS WERE HIDEOUS WITH FAMINE
WE ARE RATHER LATE AND IT WON'T DO TO KEEP THE CLERGYMAN WAITING MOVE ON MY MEN AS QUICK AS YOU LIKE
FOR TRANSPORTING US BEYOND SEAS TO BE TRIED FOR PRETENDED OFFENCES FOR ABOLISHING THE FREE SYSTEM OF ENGLISH LAWS IN A NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE ESTABLISHING THEREIN AN ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT
BUT WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE WHAT'S THE UNGRATEFUL BEHAVIOUR OF THESE REBELS SIR WHY THE HUSBAND SENDS BACK WORD THAT THE MEDICINE WON'T SUIT HIS WIFE'S COMPLAINT AND SO SHE SHAN'T TAKE IT
AND THE BARE COFFIN HAVING BEEN SCREWED DOWN WAS HOISTED ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE BEARERS AND CARRIED INTO THE STREET NOW YOU MUST PUT YOUR BEST LEG FOREMOST OLD LADY
THAN TO RIGHT THEMSELVES BY ABOLISHING THE FORMS TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED BUT WHEN A LONG TRAIN OF ABUSES AND USURPATIONS PURSUING INVARIABLY THE SAME OBJECT EVINCES A DESIGN TO REDUCE THEM UNDER ABSOLUTE DESPOTISM
AND THE SOUND OF THE OLD DEEP BELL TO SOOTHE HIM IN HIS SLEEP OLIVER WAS AWAKENED IN THE MORNING BY A LOUD KICKING AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHOP DOOR WHICH BEFORE HE COULD HUDDLE ON HIS CLOTHES WAS REPEATED
THE TERRIFIED CHILDREN CRIED BITTERLY BUT THE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD HITHERTO REMAINED AS QUIET AS IF SHE HAD BEEN WHOLLY DEAF TO ALL THAT PASSED MENACED THEM INTO SILENCE
WHICH HE CUT INTO WEDGES THE SIZE OF HIS MOUTH WITH A CLASP KNIFE AND THEN CONSUMED WITH GREAT DEXTERITY I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID OLIVER AT LENGTH
WE HAVE REMINDED THEM OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EMIGRATION AND SETTLEMENT HERE WE HAVE APPEALED TO THEIR NATIVE JUSTICE AND MAGNANIMITY AND WE HAVE CONJURED THEM BY THE TIES OF OUR COMMON KINDRED TO DISAVOW THESE USURPATIONS
DIFFICULT TASK FOR THE GRAVE WAS SO FULL THAT THE UPPERMOST COFFIN WAS WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SURFACE
THAT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT SUBJECT AND IT WOULD BE JUST AS WELL IF YOU'D MENTION WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO NEXT AS I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T MEAN TO STOP HERE ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
ALICE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO SAY ANYTHING SO AFTER A MINUTE HUMPTY DUMPTY BEGAN AGAIN THEY'VE A TEMPER SOME OF THEM
WITH PROPER ASSISTANCE YOU MIGHT HAVE LEFT OFF AT SEVEN
I THINK IT WAS
AS IF HIS NAME WERE WRITTEN ALL OVER HIS FACE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A HUNDRED TIMES EASILY ON THAT ENORMOUS FACE HUMPTY DUMPTY WAS SITTING WITH
AND A GOOD MANY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INVENTED JUST YET THIS SOUNDED VERY HOPEFUL SO ALICE REPEATED THE FIRST VERSE TWAS BRILLIG
HE SAID AT LAST WHEN A PERSON DOESN'T KNOW A CRAVAT FROM A BELT I KNOW IT'S VERY IGNORANT OF ME ALICE SAID
BUT HUMPTY DUMPTY ONLY SHUT HIS EYES AND SAID WAIT TILL YOU'VE TRIED ALICE WAITED A MINUTE TO SEE IF HE WOULD SPEAK AGAIN
I WENT AND SHOUTED IN HIS EAR HUMPTY DUMPTY RAISED HIS VOICE ALMOST TO A SCREAM
TO BE SURE I WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID GAILY AS SHE TURNED IT ROUND FOR HIM I THOUGHT IT LOOKED A LITTLE QUEER AS I WAS SAYING THAT SEEMS TO BE DONE RIGHT
JABBERWOCKY LET'S HEAR IT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY I CAN EXPLAIN ALL THE POEMS THAT WERE EVER INVENTED
WAS NOT TRUE FOR IT WAS HIS MASTER WHO HAD THEM BUT HE BOASTED DON'T COME SO NEAR ME SAID THE GARTER
IF IT COMES TO THAT OH IT NEEDN'T COME TO THAT ALICE HASTILY SAID HOPING TO KEEP HIM FROM BEGINNING THE PIECE I'M GOING TO REPEAT
EXCLAIMED THE COLLAR NOW THERE WAS NO OTHER TO COURT AND SO HE DESPISED IT A LONG TIME PASSED AWAY THEN THE COLLAR CAME INTO THE RAG CHEST AT THE PAPER MILL
THERE ARE TWO MEANINGS PACKED UP INTO ONE WORD I SEE IT NOW ALICE REMARKED THOUGHTFULLY AND WHAT ARE TOVES
OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY SHE REPEATED THIS ALOUD AS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE SUCH A LONG WORD TO SAY OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY PEOPLE
THE FISHES ANSWERED
HOW WELL YOU CAN STRETCH YOUR LEGS OUT IT IS THE MOST GRACEFUL PERFORMANCE I HAVE EVER SEEN
ALICE COULDN'T HELP SMILING AS SHE TOOK OUT HER MEMORANDUM BOOK AND WORKED THE SUM FOR HIM
SHE SAID AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD I SHOULDN'T KNOW YOU AGAIN IF WE DID MEET HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLIED IN A DISCONTENTED TONE GIVING HER ONE OF HIS FINGERS TO SHAKE
LET'S GO BACK TO THE LAST REMARK BUT ONE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER IT ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY IN THAT CASE WE START FRESH
AND KICKED AND KNOCKED AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS SHUT I TRIED TO TURN THE HANDLE BUT THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE IS THAT ALL ALICE TIMIDLY ASKED
BUT THE COLLAR THE MOST FOR HE WAS A REAL BOASTER I HAVE HAD SUCH AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF SWEETHEARTS SAID THE COLLAR I COULD NOT BE IN PEACE IT IS TRUE
OH SAID ALICE SHE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO MAKE ANY OTHER REMARK AH YOU SHOULD SEE EM
YES ALL HIS HORSES AND ALL HIS MEN HUMPTY DUMPTY WENT ON THEY'D PICK ME UP AGAIN IN A MINUTE THEY WOULD HOWEVER
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY STRETCHING OUT ONE OF HIS GREAT HANDS
WHO BECAME GLOWING HOT BUT I LEFT HER STANDING TILL SHE GOT BLACK AGAIN THERE WAS ALSO THE FIRST OPERA DANCER SHE GAVE ME THAT CUT
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DAYS WHEN YOU MIGHT GET
SO SHE SAT DOWN AND SAID
I SEE WELL THAT YOU ARE BOTH FOR USE AND ORNAMENT
FIT FOR THE DEED I HAD TO DO MY HEART WENT HOP MY HEART WENT THUMP I FILLED THE KETTLE AT THE PUMP THEN SOME ONE CAME TO ME AND SAID
AND THEY PUT ME OUT I SENT A MESSAGE TO THE FISH I TOLD THEM
IMPENETRABILITY THAT'S WHAT I SAY
NEVER HAPPENED TO IT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO BEWARE
AND WENT PROUDLY OVER THE COLLAR FOR SHE FANCIED SHE WAS A STEAM ENGINE THAT WOULD GO ON THE RAILROAD AND DRAW THE WAGGONS RAG
THEY ARE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY ALSO THEY MAKE THEIR NESTS UNDER SUN DIALS ALSO THEY LIVE ON CHEESE
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE OLDER WE GREW THE MORE OUR MINDS WERE ALIENATED FROM HER AND THE MORE WE CAME TO REGARD HER AS OUR ENEMY IF SHE REALLY MEANT TO BE OUR FRIEND AFTER THE BEST FASHION SHE KNEW IT WAS AT LEAST AN UNCOMELY KIND OF FRIENDSHIP
WHAT IS IT NOW THERE'S A FRIEND OF NANNY'S A LAME BOY CALLED JIM I'VE HEARD OF HIM SAID MISTER RAYMOND WELL NANNY DOESN'T CARE MUCH ABOUT GOING TO THE COUNTRY SIR
HIS OPINION OF HIM WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM NANNY'S
YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO THE STABLE LOOK AT THE HORSE NEXT YOU HE'S SOMETHING LIKE A HORSE ALL SKIN AND BONE AND HIS MASTER AIN'T OVER KIND TO HIM EITHER HE PUT A STINGING LASH ON HIS WHIP LAST WEEK BUT THAT OLD HORSE KNOWS HE'S GOT THE WIFE AND CHILDREN TO KEEP
THEY WOULD NEITHER BE SO GREAT IN THEIR DEGREE SO UNIFORM IN THEIR OPERATION NOR SO ODIOUS IN THEIR APPEARANCE AS THOSE WHICH WOULD NECESSARILY SPRING FROM QUOTAS UPON ANY SCALE THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE DEVISED
THERE YOU ARE WITH YOUR HUGE CARCASS CRUSHING DOWN YOUR POOR LEGS ALL NIGHT LONG YOU DON'T EVEN CARE FOR YOUR OWN LEGS SO LONG AS YOU CAN EAT EAT AND SLEEP SLEEP YOU A HORSE INDEED BUT I TELL YOU I WAS LAME
IF WE ARE UNWILLING TO IMPAIR THE FORCE OF THIS APPLAUDED PROVISION WE SHALL BE OBLIGED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE UNITED STATES AFFORD THE EXTRAORDINARY SPECTACLE OF A GOVERNMENT DESTITUTE EVEN OF THE SHADOW OF CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO ENFORCE THE EXECUTION OF ITS OWN LAWS
AS FOR NANNY SHE HAD BEEN SO HAPPY EVER SINCE SHE LEFT THE HOSPITAL
IN A COUNTRY IMPERFECTLY SETTLED AND PROGRESSIVE IN IMPROVEMENT
BY BEING CROSS WITH THEM THIS COMES OF NOT HAVING FAITH ENOUGH IN GOD AND SHOWS HOW NECESSARY THIS FAITH IS FOR WHEN WE LOSE IT WE LOSE EVEN THE KINDNESS WHICH ALONE CAN SOOTHE THE SUFFERING
THE WEATHER WAS VERY HOT AND THE WOODS VERY SHADOWY THERE WERE NOT A GREAT MANY WILD FLOWERS
DIAMOND IN CONSEQUENCE HAD GONE TO BED VERY QUIET AND THOUGHTFUL A LITTLE TROUBLED INDEED IT HAD BEEN A VERY STORMY WINTER
IN THE COURSE OF TIME AND THINGS AN EQUILIBRIUM AS FAR AS IT IS ATTAINABLE IN SO COMPLICATED A SUBJECT WILL BE ESTABLISHED EVERYWHERE
MAY BE ATTENDED WITH FEWER INCONVENIENCES THAN TO LEAVE THAT DISCRETION ALTOGETHER AT LARGE
THIS RIGHT WOULD REMAIN UNDIMINISHED
IT'S MY BELIEF ONCE OUT THEY'D STICK OUT FOR EVER TALK OF KICKING WHY DON'T YOU PUT ONE FOOT BEFORE THE OTHER NOW AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CAB THE ABUSE MASTER GETS FOR YOUR SAKE IS QUITE SHAMEFUL NO DECENT HORSE WOULD BRING IT ON HIM
THEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SPAKE LIKE A DISCONTENTED PROPHET OF OLD WHY DOESN'T HE GIVE THEM SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT THEN
HE WOULD ASK OUR VERSION OF THE AFFAIR AND LISTEN TO THAT AS HE HAD LISTENED TO HERS THEN HE WOULD SET FORTH TO US WHERE WE HAD BEEN WRONG IF WE WERE WRONG AND SEND US AWAY WITH AN INJUNCTION NOT TO PROVOKE MISSUS MITCHELL WHO COULDN'T HELP BEING SHORT IN HER TEMPER POOR THING
THAT THE ACTIVE WEALTH OF KING'S COUNTY BEARS A MUCH GREATER PROPORTION TO THAT OF MONTGOMERY THAN IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE IF WE SHOULD TAKE EITHER THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE LANDS OR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE AS A CRITERION THE WEALTH OF NATIONS DEPENDS UPON AN INFINITE VARIETY OF CAUSES
SAID OLD DIAMOND YOU ARE SO PLUMP AND YOUR SKIN SHINES SO YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF THERE'S NO HARM IN BEING FAT SAID RUBY IN A DEPRECATING TONE NO NOR IN BEING SLEEK I MAY AS WELL SHINE AS NOT
BUT SHE WOULD PUT A SKIN OVER IT AFTER HER OWN FASHION
A LITTLE LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE DUSTY WINDOW FROM A GAS LAMP SUFFICIENT TO SHOW HIM DIAMOND AND RUBY WITH THEIR TWO HEADS UP
THERE IS DOUBTLESS A STRIKING ABSURDITY IN SUPPOSING THAT A RIGHT OF THIS KIND DOES NOT EXIST
WHICH PRODUCE AND CONSTITUTE NATIONAL WEALTH MUST BE SATISFIED THAT THERE IS NO COMMON STANDARD OR BAROMETER BY WHICH THE DEGREES OF IT CAN BE ASCERTAINED
AND AS I HEAR GET ALONG NO FASTER THAN A BIG DRAY HORSE WITH TWO TONS BEHIND HIM SO THEY TELL ME YOUR MASTER'S NOT MINE SAID RUBY I MUST ATTEND TO MY OWN MASTER'S INTERESTS AND EAT ALL THAT IS GIVEN ME
AND WENT ON BLOWING SHE WANTS ME TO GO INTO THE STABLE
BY WHICH IT IS DECLARED THAT EACH STATE SHALL RETAIN EVERY POWER JURISDICTION AND RIGHT
AND HE WORKS LIKE A HORSE I DARESAY HE GRUDGES HIS MASTER THE BEER HE DRINKS
WHERE THE WHOLE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE
BUT KIRSTY HAD COME FROM A REGION WHERE THE HILLS WERE HILLS INDEED HILLS WITH MIGHTY SKELETONS OF STONE INSIDE THEM
IS ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN THE CONFEDERATION
AND BE SLEEK AND FAT AS I CAN AND GO NO FASTER THAN I NEED NOW REALLY IF THE REST OF THE HORSES WEREN'T ALL ASLEEP POOR THINGS THEY WORK TILL THEY'RE TIRED
A SUCCESSFUL FACTION MAY ERECT A TYRANNY ON THE RUINS OF ORDER AND LAW WHILE NO SUCCOR COULD CONSTITUTIONALLY BE AFFORDED BY THE UNION TO THE FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
IN EVERY COUNTRY IT IS A HERCULEAN TASK
WHERE THEY FOUND A CART WAITING TO CARRY THEM AND THEIR LUGGAGE TO THE MOUND WHICH WAS THE NAME OF MISTER RAYMOND'S NEW RESIDENCE I WILL NOT DESCRIBE THE VARIED FEELINGS OF THE PARTY AS THEY WENT OR WHEN THEY ARRIVED ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT DIAMOND WHO IS MY ONLY CARE WAS FULL OF QUIET DELIGHT
HE ASKED I'M ALWAYS WANTING SOMETHING SIR ANSWERED DIAMOND WELL THAT'S QUITE RIGHT SO LONG AS WHAT YOU WANT IS RIGHT EVERYBODY IS ALWAYS WANTING SOMETHING ONLY WE DON'T MENTION IT
THE GENIUS OF THE CITIZENS THE DEGREE OF INFORMATION THEY POSSESS THE STATE OF COMMERCE OF ARTS OF INDUSTRY THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MANY MORE TOO COMPLEX MINUTE OR ADVENTITIOUS TO ADMIT OF A PARTICULAR SPECIFICATION
WHICH SHE CLAIMED FOR ALL HIGHLAND FOLK A LIGHT STEP A SWEET VOICE AND A MOST BOUNTEOUS HAND BUT THERE I COME INTO THE MORAL NATURE OF HER
I KNOW HE CAN SHINE BOOTS SIR SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR US
MUCH DEPRESSED AND TO ME UNACCOUNTABLY SO I SLOWLY DESCENDED TO THE STREET THE SCENE I HAD WITNESSED SEEMED TO MARK THE DEFEAT AND ANNIHILATION OF THE FORCES OF A KINDRED PEOPLE
AND THE PEOPLES WERE AS SOFT AS THE STUFF THEY SAILED UPON IN OUR DAY WE HAVE PROGRESSED TO A POINT WHERE SUCH SENTIMENTS MARK WEAKNESS AND ATAVISM IT WILL NOT BE WELL FOR YOU TO PERMIT TARS TARKAS TO LEARN THAT YOU HOLD SUCH DEGENERATE SENTIMENTS
AND YET HERE I STOOD BUT NAKED AS AT THE MINUTE OF MY BIRTH THE TRANSITION HAD BEEN SO SUDDEN AND SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT LEFT ME FOR A MOMENT FORGETFUL OF AUGHT ELSE THAN MY STRANGE METAMORPHOSIS MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS
AND FROM MY BALCONY I COULD SEE THAT IT WALKED ERECT UPON TWO LEGS AND SURMISED THAT IT WAS SOME NEW AND STRANGE MARTIAN MONSTROSITY WITH WHICH I HAD NOT AS YET BECOME ACQUAINTED THEY REMOVED THEIR PRISONER TO THE GROUND
AS SOLA AND I ENTERED THE PLAZA A SIGHT MET MY EYES WHICH FILLED MY WHOLE BEING WITH A GREAT SURGE OF MINGLED HOPE FEAR EXULTATION AND DEPRESSION AND YET MOST DOMINANT WAS A SUBTLE SENSE OF RELIEF AND HAPPINESS
AND WHEN THE NECESSITY ARISES FIGHT WITH EVEN GREATER INTELLIGENCE AND FEROCITY THAN THE MEN THE MEN ARE TRAINED IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF THE ART OF WAR IN STRATEGY AND THE MANEUVERING OF LARGE BODIES OF TROOPS
THE LAST WARRIOR TO LEAVE THE DECK TURNED AND THREW SOMETHING BACK UPON THE VESSEL WAITING AN INSTANT TO NOTE THE OUTCOME OF HIS ACT AS A FAINT SPURT OF FLAME ROSE FROM THE POINT WHERE THE MISSILE STRUCK HE SWUNG OVER THE SIDE AND WAS QUICKLY UPON THE GROUND
WHILE THE BANNERS AND UPPER WORKS DISSOLVED IN SPURTS OF FLAME AS THE IRRESISTIBLE PROJECTILES OF OUR WARRIORS MOWED THROUGH THEM THE FIRE FROM THE VESSELS WAS MOST INEFFECTUAL OWING AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED
AND THE SIGHT WHICH MET MY EYES WAS THAT OF A SLENDER GIRLISH FIGURE SIMILAR IN EVERY DETAIL TO THE EARTHLY WOMEN OF MY PAST LIFE SHE DID NOT SEE ME AT FIRST BUT JUST AS SHE WAS DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE PORTAL OF THE BUILDING WHICH WAS TO BE HER PRISON SHE TURNED
I DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE BUT FIRST I LIFTED MY HEAD TO FILL MY LUNGS WITH THE PURE INVIGORATING NIGHT AIR OF THE MOUNTAINS AS I DID SO I SAW STRETCHING FAR BELOW ME THE BEAUTIFUL VISTA OF ROCKY GORGE AND LEVEL CACTI STUDDED FLAT
FOR EXAMPLE A PROPORTION OF THEM ALWAYS THE BEST MARKSMEN DIRECT THEIR FIRE ENTIRELY UPON THE WIRELESS FINDING AND SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE BIG GUNS OF AN ATTACKING NAVAL FORCE ANOTHER DETAIL ATTENDS TO THE SMALLER GUNS IN THE SAME WAY
WHICH LAY JUST WITHIN MY RANGE OF VISION UPON THE LEDGE WHERE I HAD PLACED IT IN THE EARLY MORNING FROM THEN UNTIL POSSIBLY MIDNIGHT ALL WAS SILENCE THE SILENCE OF THE DEAD THEN SUDDENLY THE AWFUL MOAN OF THE MORNING BROKE UPON MY STARTLED EARS
I MOUNTED TO AN UPPER FLOOR AND PEERED FROM THE WINDOW OUT OVER THE VALLEY AND THE HILLS BEYOND AND THERE I SAW THE CAUSE OF THEIR SUDDEN SCURRYING TO COVER A HUGE CRAFT LONG LOW AND GRAY PAINTED SWUNG SLOWLY OVER THE CREST OF THE NEAREST HILL
AS I CAME BACK TO MYSELF I GLANCED AT SOLA WHO HAD WITNESSED THIS ENCOUNTER AND I WAS SURPRISED TO NOTE A STRANGE EXPRESSION UPON HER USUALLY EXPRESSIONLESS COUNTENANCE WHAT HER THOUGHTS WERE I DID NOT KNOW FOR AS YET I HAD LEARNED BUT LITTLE OF THE MARTIAN TONGUE
AND EXHIBIT HER LAST AGONIES AT THE GREAT GAMES BEFORE TAL HAJUS REPLIED SARKOJA WHAT WILL BE THE MANNER OF HER GOING OUT INQUIRED SOLA SHE IS VERY SMALL AND VERY BEAUTIFUL I HAD HOPED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD HER FOR RANSOM
AS THE CRAFT NEARED THE BUILDING AND JUST BEFORE SHE STRUCK THE MARTIAN WARRIORS SWARMED UPON HER FROM THE WINDOWS AND WITH THEIR GREAT SPEARS EASED THE SHOCK OF THE COLLISION
WITH ONE'S BACK TOWARD SOME HORRIBLE AND UNKNOWN DANGER FROM THE VERY SOUND OF WHICH THE FEROCIOUS APACHE WARRIORS TURN IN WILD STAMPEDE AS A FLOCK OF SHEEP WOULD MADLY FLEE FROM A PACK OF WOLVES SEEMS TO ME THE LAST WORD IN FEARSOME PREDICAMENTS
SARKOJA AND THE OTHER WOMEN GRUNTED ANGRILY AT THIS EVIDENCE OF WEAKNESS ON THE PART OF SOLA IT IS SAD SOLA THAT YOU WERE NOT BORN A MILLION YEARS AGO SNAPPED SARKOJA WHEN ALL THE HOLLOWS OF THE LAND WERE FILLED WITH WATER
THE CRISP FRESH MOUNTAIN AIR OUTSIDE THE CAVE ACTED AS AN IMMEDIATE TONIC AND I FELT NEW LIFE AND NEW COURAGE COURSING THROUGH ME PAUSING UPON THE BRINK OF THE LEDGE I UPBRAIDED MYSELF FOR WHAT NOW SEEMED TO ME WHOLLY UNWARRANTED APPREHENSION
EACH FACE WAS THE PICTURE OF AWE AND FEAR BUT FOR WHAT REASON I DID NOT KNOW NOR DID I LEARN UNTIL TEN YEARS LATER THAT THERE WERE STILL OTHER BRAVES BEHIND THOSE WHO REGARDED ME WAS APPARENT FROM THE FACT THAT THE LEADERS PASSED BACK WHISPERED WORD TO THOSE BEHIND THEM
THE FOREMOST VESSEL SWUNG BROADSIDE TOWARD US AND BRINGING HER GUNS INTO PLAY RETURNED OUR FIRE AT THE SAME TIME MOVING PARALLEL TO OUR FRONT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN TURNING BACK WITH THE EVIDENT INTENTION OF COMPLETING A GREAT CIRCLE WHICH WOULD BRING HER UP TO POSITION ONCE MORE OPPOSITE OUR FIRING LINE
BUT ARE ALSO THE ARTISANS WHO PRODUCE EVERY MANUFACTURED ARTICLE WROUGHT BY THE GREEN MARTIANS THEY MAKE THE POWDER THE CARTRIDGES THE FIREARMS IN FACT EVERYTHING OF VALUE IS PRODUCED BY THE FEMALES IN TIME OF ACTUAL WARFARE THEY FORM A PART OF THE RESERVES
AFTER THE LAST LOAD HAD BEEN REMOVED THE WARRIORS MADE LINES FAST TO THE CRAFT AND TOWED HER FAR OUT INTO THE VALLEY IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION A FEW OF THEM THEN BOARDED HER AND WERE BUSILY ENGAGED IN WHAT APPEARED FROM MY DISTANT POSITION
FROM THEN ON SOLA INSTRUCTED ME IN THE MYSTERIES OF THE VARIOUS WEAPONS AND WITH THE MARTIAN YOUNG I SPENT SEVERAL HOURS EACH DAY PRACTICING UPON THE PLAZA
ENOUGH ONLY TO SUFFICE FOR MY DAILY NEEDS AS I REACHED THE DOORWAY OF OUR BUILDING A STRANGE SURPRISE AWAITED ME A WARRIOR APPROACHED BEARING THE ARMS ORNAMENTS AND FULL ACCOUTERMENTS OF HIS KIND THESE HE PRESENTED TO ME WITH A FEW UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS
AND FAR FROM BEING IN A POSITION TO INFLICT HARM UPON US SHE COULD NOT EVEN CONTROL HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE AS SHE NEARED THE CITY THE WARRIORS RUSHED OUT UPON THE PLAIN TO MEET HER
IS THIS THEN DEATH HAVE I INDEED PASSED OVER FOREVER INTO THAT OTHER LIFE BUT I COULD NOT WELL BELIEVE THIS AS I COULD FEEL MY HEART POUNDING AGAINST MY RIBS FROM THE EXERTION OF MY EFFORTS TO RELEASE MYSELF FROM THE ANAESTHESIS WHICH HAD HELD ME
AND SAYING I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT THE PERTURBATION IN MY MIND IN REGARD TO THINKING ABOUT IT BEING TRULY DREADFUL AFTER MY LADY HAD GONE AWAY I APPLIED THE REMEDY WHICH I HAVE NEVER YET FOUND TO FAIL ME
WAITING FOR HIM AT HOME WAITING TO CONGRATULATE HIM ON THE END OF ALL HIS TROUBLE THINK OF ELEANOR PAPA SAID MISSUS GRANTLY I DO THINK OF HER SAID HER FATHER
AND SAID I AM SURE SUSAN WILL NOT ASK ME TO BREAK MY WORD OR TO DO WHAT I KNOW TO BE WRONG PAPA SAID SHE IT WOULD BE MADNESS IN YOU TO THROW UP YOUR PREFERMENT WHAT ARE YOU TO LIVE ON
YOU HAVE HEARD OF BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADIES FALLING IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT AND HAVE THOUGHT IT NATURAL ENOUGH BUT A HOUSEMAID OUT OF A REFORMATORY WITH A PLAIN FACE AND A DEFORMED SHOULDER FALLING IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
IN THE TIME OF THE OLD LORD I HAD BEEN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS IN HER SERVICE AND SHE PUT INTO MY HANDS A BEAUTIFUL WAISTCOAT OF WOOL THAT SHE HAD WORKED HERSELF TO KEEP ME WARM IN THE BITTER WINTER WEATHER
AS SHE DID WHEN SHE WENT DOWN TO MEET MISTER FRANKLIN IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE FOOTMAN'S REPORT WAS THAT THE PRESERVATION OF A RESPECTFUL COMPOSURE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS BETTERS AND THE WAITING ON MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AT DINNER WERE TWO OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO RECONCILE WITH EACH OTHER
I WENT ON WITH MY BUSINESS AS BAILIFF YEAR AFTER YEAR UP TO CHRISTMAS EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN WHEN THERE CAME A CHANGE IN MY LIFE ON THAT DAY MY LADY INVITED HERSELF TO A CUP OF TEA ALONE WITH ME IN MY COTTAGE SHE REMARKED THAT
BY THE TIME I HAD GOT TO THE CORNER THE TRESPASSERS WHOEVER THEY WERE
HE MADE NO DISTINCT ANSWER TO THE ARCHDEACON'S LAST PROPOSITION FOR HIS MIND WAS CHIEFLY ENGAGED ON THINKING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE TO BED THAT HIS RESIGNATION WAS A THING FINALLY FIXED ON A FACT ALL BUT COMPLETED
BEING OLD AND SLY
AND ON THE DINGY SOFA BEHIND HIM RECLINED HIS PATIENT WIFE
MY FEET BETRAYED ME ON THE GRAVEL BEFORE I COULD STEAL SUDDENLY ROUND THE CORNER AS I HAD PROPOSED I HEARD LIGHTER FEET THAN MINE AND MORE THAN ONE PAIR OF THEM AS I THOUGHT RETREATING IN A HURRY
CONTINUED THE REVEREND CROSS EXAMINER MISTER HARDING COULD NOT DENY THIS I'M SURE SIR ABRAHAM MUST HAVE ADVISED YOU TO CONSULT YOUR FRIENDS TO THIS PROPOSITION ALSO MISTER HARDING WAS OBLIGED TO ASSENT
THE WARDEN HUNG HIS HEAD AND MADE NO REPLY HE COULD NOT CONDESCEND TO SAY THAT HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO GIVE HIS SON IN LAW THE SLIP AND AS HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AVOW IT HE SAID NOTHING PAPA HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU
I RECEIVED THIS MAGNIFICENT PRESENT QUITE AT A LOSS TO FIND WORDS TO THANK MY MISTRESS WITH FOR THE HONOUR SHE HAD DONE ME
BUT SUSAN DIDN'T WANT TO GO TILL HER HUSBAND WENT SHE HAD AN IDEA THAT HER PAPA MIGHT BE BULLIED IF SHE WERE AWAY SHE WASN'T TIRED AT ALL
SAID THE LADY THE ARCHDEACON TOOK ANOTHER TURN AND AGAIN EJACULATED GOOD HEAVENS THIS TIME IN A VERY LOW WHISPER BUT STILL AUDIBLE I THINK I'LL GO TO BED SAID THE WARDEN
THERE I LIVED TILL MISS JULIA MARRIED THE LATE SIR JOHN VERINDER AN EXCELLENT MAN WHO ONLY WANTED SOMEBODY TO MANAGE HIM AND BETWEEN OURSELVES HE FOUND SOMEBODY TO DO IT AND WHAT IS MORE HE THROVE ON IT AND GREW FAT ON IT AND LIVED HAPPY AND DIED EASY ON IT
A LITTLE BRIGHT OBJECT LYING ON THE CLEAN GRAVEL UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE MOON PICKING THE OBJECT UP I DISCOVERED IT WAS A SMALL BOTTLE CONTAINING A THICK SWEET SMELLING LIQUOR AS BLACK AS INK
THERE WAS A PAUSE FOR ABOUT A MINUTE AND THEN THE WARDEN FINDING THAT NOTHING ELSE WAS COMING LIGHTED HIS CANDLE AND QUIETLY SAID GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT PAPA SAID THE LADY
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR MY LADY WHO WITH PAIN AND TRAVAIL PRODUCED HER INTO THE WORLD CONSEQUENTLY IF WE BEGIN WITH MY LADY WE ARE PRETTY SURE OF BEGINNING FAR ENOUGH BACK AND THAT LET ME TELL YOU
I CAN'T DO WITHOUT GABRIEL BETTEREDGE MY LADY SAYS SIR JOHN I CAN'T DO WITHOUT HIM EITHER THAT WAS HIS WAY WITH HER AND THAT WAS HOW I WENT INTO HIS SERVICE IT WAS ALL ONE TO ME WHERE I WENT
REMEMBER WHAT ADAM WANTED WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND IF YOU DON'T BLAME IT IN ADAM DON'T BLAME IT IN ME THE WOMAN I FIXED MY EYE ON WAS THE WOMAN WHO KEPT HOUSE FOR ME AT MY COTTAGE HER NAME WAS SELINA GOBY
MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE GOT IN MY WAY JUST AS HER LATE MOTHER USED TO GET IN MY WAY ON THE STAIRS AND INSTANTLY SUMMONED ME TO TELL HER ALL THAT HAD PASSED AT THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN MISTER FRANKLIN AND ME UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE ONE THING TO BE DONE
YOU KNOW YOU NEVER EXPECTED PAPA TO PAY THE COSTS SUCH ABSURDITY IS ENOUGH TO PROVOKE JOB SAID THE ARCHDEACON MARCHING QUICKLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM YOUR FATHER IS LIKE A CHILD EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR
WHEN SHE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT MISTER FRANKLIN THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN US CONDUCTED IN THIS WAY WAS TIRESOME ENOUGH UNTIL MY DAUGHTER SUDDENLY ENDED IT BY BURSTING OUT WITH WHAT I THOUGHT THE MOST MONSTROUS SUPPOSITION I HAD EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE
IN THE CHARACTER OF LADY VERINDER'S HOUSE STEWARD ALL QUITE COMFORTABLE AND ALL THROUGH ROBINSON CRUSOE MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE HAS JUST LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR
ISN'T IT ASKED THE WARDEN INNOCENTLY WELL AT ANY RATE I'VE DONE IT NOW SIR ABRAHAM DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK IT SO VERY STRANGE THE ARCHDEACON GAVE A SIGH THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED A MAN OF WAR
AND HE GAVE HIS DAUGHTER A KISS AND SHOOK HANDS WITH THE DOCTOR AND AGAIN TRIED TO LOOK UNCONCERNED
HOW IT WAS I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT WE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE
AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH WE ARE SCARCELY LESS EAGER TO MEET HER AGAIN I REALLY DO NOT THINK GEORGIANA DARCY HAS HER EQUAL FOR BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE AFFECTION SHE INSPIRES IN LOUISA AND MYSELF
FROM THIS DAY YOU MUST BE A STRANGER TO ONE OF YOUR PARENTS YOUR MOTHER WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT MARRY MISTER COLLINS AND I WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO
NO ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN YOU TOGETHER CAN DOUBT HIS AFFECTION MISS BINGLEY I AM SURE CANNOT SHE IS NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HALF AS MUCH LOVE IN MISTER DARCY FOR HERSELF
WHO HAS BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS I HAVE BEEN IN EARLY PREFERMENT AND I TRUST I AM RESIGNED
AND THAT SHE WISHED HER ALL IMAGINABLE HAPPINESS I SEE WHAT YOU ARE FEELING REPLIED CHARLOTTE YOU MUST BE SURPRISED VERY MUCH SURPRISED SO LATELY AS MISTER COLLINS WAS WISHING TO MARRY YOU
IN INDULGING THE HOPE OF AN EVENT WHICH WILL SECURE THE HAPPINESS OF SO MANY
AND ELIZABETH SOMETIMES WITH REAL EARNESTNESS AND SOMETIMES WITH PLAYFUL GAIETY REPLIED TO HER ATTACKS THOUGH HER MANNER VARIED HOWEVER HER DETERMINATION NEVER DID
SAID JANE AS SHE FINISHED IT IS IT NOT CLEAR ENOUGH DOES IT NOT EXPRESSLY DECLARE THAT CAROLINE NEITHER EXPECTS NOR WISHES ME TO BE HER SISTER THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HER BROTHER'S INDIFFERENCE
AND ON PERCEIVING WHOM SHE SAID TO THE GIRLS
HE IMAGINED THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TO LONDON MIGHT BE CONCLUDED IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN IT CANNOT BE SO AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVINCED THAT WHEN CHARLES GETS TO TOWN HE WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE IT AGAIN
MISTER COLLINS RECEIVED AND RETURNED THESE FELICITATIONS WITH EQUAL PLEASURE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO RELATE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR INTERVIEW WITH THE RESULT OF WHICH HE TRUSTED HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED
AND IF MY MANNER HAS BEEN AT ALL REPREHENSIBLE
MY DEAR MADAM HE REPLIED THIS INVITATION IS PARTICULARLY GRATIFYING BECAUSE IT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN HOPING TO RECEIVE
IN AS SHORT A TIME AS MISTER COLLINS'S LONG SPEECHES WOULD ALLOW EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED BETWEEN THEM TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE
I WILL HAVE NO RESERVES FROM YOU
WHY WILL YOU THINK SO IT MUST BE HIS OWN DOING HE IS HIS OWN MASTER BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW ALL I WILL READ YOU THE PASSAGE WHICH PARTICULARLY HURTS ME
WHO SUFFER AS I DO FROM NERVOUS COMPLAINTS CAN HAVE NO GREAT INCLINATION FOR TALKING
BY ENGAGING THEM TOWARDS HERSELF SUCH WAS MISS LUCAS'S SCHEME AND APPEARANCES WERE SO FAVOURABLE THAT WHEN THEY PARTED AT NIGHT
MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
AND MISSUS BENNET WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CORDIALITY SAID HOW HAPPY THEY SHOULD BE TO SEE HIM AT LONGBOURN AGAIN
SIR YOU QUITE MISUNDERSTAND ME SAID MISSUS BENNET ALARMED LIZZY IS ONLY HEADSTRONG IN SUCH MATTERS AS THESE IN EVERYTHING ELSE SHE IS AS GOOD NATURED A GIRL AS EVER LIVED
WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN HANDSOME SHE FELT ALL THE GOOD LUCK OF IT THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE BUSINESS WAS THE SURPRISE IT MUST OCCASION TO ELIZABETH BENNET
AND YOU MAY BE VERY CERTAIN THAT I SHALL AVAIL MYSELF OF IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED AND MISTER BENNET WHO COULD BY NO MEANS WISH FOR SO SPEEDY A RETURN
IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
IS HEIGHTENED INTO SOMETHING STILL MORE INTERESTING
WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUED BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON ELIZABETH WOULD WONDER AND PROBABLY WOULD BLAME HER AND THOUGH HER RESOLUTION WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN HER FEELINGS MUST BE HURT
THE BENNETS WERE ENGAGED TO DINE WITH THE LUCASES AND AGAIN DURING THE CHIEF OF THE DAY WAS MISS LUCAS SO KIND AS TO LISTEN TO MISTER COLLINS ELIZABETH TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING HER
AND IF UPON MATURE DELIBERATION YOU FIND THAT THE MISERY OF DISOBLIGING HIS TWO SISTERS IS MORE THAN EQUIVALENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF BEING HIS WIFE I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO REFUSE HIM
THERE WAS A SOLIDITY IN HIS REFLECTIONS WHICH OFTEN STRUCK HER AND THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO CLEVER AS HERSELF SHE THOUGHT THAT IF ENCOURAGED TO READ AND IMPROVE HIMSELF BY SUCH AN EXAMPLE AS HERS
FOR THE CURIOSITY EXCITED BY HIS LONG ABSENCE BURST FORTH IN SUCH VERY DIRECT QUESTIONS ON HIS RETURN AS REQUIRED SOME INGENUITY TO EVADE AND HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME EXERCISING GREAT SELF DENIAL
AND HIS PROSPECTS OF FUTURE WEALTH WERE EXCEEDINGLY FAIR LADY LUCAS BEGAN DIRECTLY TO CALCULATE WITH MORE INTEREST THAN THE MATTER HAD EVER EXCITED BEFORE HOW MANY YEARS LONGER MISTER BENNET WAS LIKELY TO LIVE
WITHOUT HAVING PAID YOURSELF AND MISTER BENNET THE COMPLIMENT OF REQUESTING YOU TO INTERPOSE YOUR AUTHORITY IN MY BEHALF
YOU CANNOT BE TOO MUCH UPON YOUR GUARD RISK ANYTHING RATHER THAN HER DISPLEASURE AND IF YOU FIND IT LIKELY TO BE RAISED BY YOUR COMING TO US AGAIN WHICH I SHOULD THINK EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
UPON THE SINGLE CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD ABANDON PIRACY AND AGREE TO BECOME QUIET CITIZENS IN WHATEVER RESPECTABLE VOCATION THEY MIGHT SELECT TO THESE TERMS ROC AND HIS MEN AGREED WITHOUT ARGUMENT
TO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
HE WOULD GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY HIS FREEDOM AND TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS AND THIS OF COURSE WAS A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO THE POOR FELLOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME THE SLAVE AGREED TO THE PROPOSALS
AND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAY
AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
IF THEY COULD DO THIS IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO RUSH UPON THE UNSUSPECTING GARRISON AND HAVING ANNIHILATED THESE MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE TOWN BUT THEIR PLANS DID NOT WORK VERY WELL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY SOME INDIANS
OUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSE
BUT AS SOON AS THEY COULD MANAGE IT THEY SAILED BACK TO THE WEST INDIES AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN JAMAICA
DIFFERING FROM THEM ONLY IN RESPECT TO INTENSITY AND FORCE BUT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WITH IDEAS
IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
BUT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF GAINING ESTEEM AND ROC'S METHOD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL IN THE CASE OF HIS LITERARY ASSOCIATE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE HATRED OF THE SPANIARDS BY THE BUCCANEERS BEGAN VERY EARLY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WEST INDIES
THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE OATHS THEY HAD TAKEN TO ABANDON PIRACY THAN THEY THOUGHT OF THE OATHS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING RIGHT AND LEFT
STILL THE PIRATES DID NOT HESITATE THEY ADVANCED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK JUST AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE BOARDING A SPANISH VESSEL BUT THEY SOON FOUND THAT FIGHTING ON LAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING AT SEA
BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
IN YUCATAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A BOLD AND RASH UNDERTAKING THE TWO PIRATES WERE BOLD AND RASH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ROC HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN MERIDA AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED THAT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS COULD LAND UPON THE COAST
THE NEXT DAY WET AND BEDRAGGLED FROM MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEEDS AND MUD OF THE COAST HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE FORTRESS WITH HIS LETTER AND WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR NO ONE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PERSON EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PLACE
BY THE HAND OF ROC WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO THESE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AND IMPRISONED WHEN THEY WERE DOING NO HARM TO ANYBODY HE WOULD SWEAR IN HIS MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT NEVER
COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
HE KNEW THAT THE FRENCH SHIP WHICH WAS LYING OUTSIDE THE HARBOR WAS A POWERFUL VESSEL AND HE DID NOT LIKE FRENCH SHIPS ANYWAY THE TOWN HAD ONCE BEEN TAKEN AND VERY BADLY TREATED BY A LITTLE FLEET OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUCCANEERS
IF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT THE GREAT PIRATE ROC HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN CAMPEACHY IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A PRISONER TO HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FRIENDS SO NEAR BY AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK ROC'S CASE INTO MOST EARNEST CONSIDERATION
BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATION
DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTER
AND WERE CONSIDERED AS WILD BEASTS TO BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WHEREVER CAUGHT CONSEQUENTLY ROC AND HIS MEN WERE THROWN INTO A DUNGEON AND CONDEMNED TO BE EXECUTED IF HOWEVER THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIMSELF
WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ON MERIDA AND WHO WROTE THE ACCOUNT OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO BE CALLED UPON TO RECORD THAT HIS GREAT HERO ROC THE BRAZILIAN SAVED HIS LIFE AFTER THE UTTER DEFEAT OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS
WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS AN EASY THING TO FRIGHTEN A CHILD INTO GOING TO SLEEP IF I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A YOUNGSTER TAKE A NAP I SHOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN CUBA OR OF THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE ARMENIANS
FROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASE
HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
HIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTS
THAT THE SCARECROW HEARTILY CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS IMPROVED APPEARANCE THAT NICKEL PLATE WAS I CONFESS A HAPPY THOUGHT SAID NICK
BUT THAT ANIMAL BEING STILL UPON HIS BACK KICKED OUT SO VICIOUSLY WITH HIS WOODEN LEGS
CRIED TO THE TIN WOODMAN TO SAVE HIM AND THAT GOOD FRIEND RESPONDED WITH RENEWED ENERGY HIS AXE FAIRLY FLASHED AMONG THE JACKDAWS AND FORTUNATELY THE GUMP BEGAN WILDLY WAVING THE TWO WINGS REMAINING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF ITS BODY
THAT INSECTS WORE CLOTHES NOR DO THEY IN THEIR NATURAL STATE RETURNED THE STRANGER BUT IN THE COURSE OF MY WANDERINGS I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SAVE THE NINTH LIFE OF A TAILOR
I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN HIS POWERS STILL HE CAN RUN
AND THEY FLED SCREAMING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WHEN THE LAST FOE HAD DISAPPEARED TIP CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE SOFAS AND ASSISTED THE WOGGLE BUG TO FOLLOW HIM
KNOWING NO BETTER I USED MY ARMS AS WELL AS MY LEGS FOR WALKING AND CRAWLED UNDER THE EDGES OF STONES OR HID AMONG THE ROOTS OF GRASSES WITH NO THOUGHT BEYOND FINDING A FEW INSECTS SMALLER THAN MYSELF TO FEED UPON
TIP DURING THIS CONVERSATION WAS LOOKING AT THE WOODMAN WITH UNDISGUISED AMAZEMENT AND NOTICED THAT THE CELEBRATED EMPEROR OF THE WINKIES WAS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF PIECES OF TIN
LET US BEND OUR STEPS TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY
THEN AT ONCE THE PAIN STOPPED AND THE BOY ROSE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND FOUND THE SCARECROW LOOKING WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE END OF THE PEPPER BOX WHAT'S HAPPENED ASKED THE BOY A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HIS RECENT EXHIBITION
SO THE SAW HORSE CONTINUED HIS WILD CAREER UNCHECKED AND WITH UNABATED SPEED PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO THE BANKS OF A WIDE RIVER
WHO WERE MORE FRIGHTENED THAN HURT OFF THE GROUND AND THE PUPILS CLUSTERED AROUND HIM CLOSELY GROUPED I CALMLY WALKED OUT OF THE SCHOOL HOUSE TURNED A CORNER AND ESCAPED UNNOTICED
WHY NOT USE ONE OF HIS LEGS TO MAKE A LEG FOR THE HORSE THAT CARRIES HIM I JUDGE THAT BOTH ARE MADE OF WOOD NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL REAL CLEVERNESS SAID THE SCARECROW APPROVINGLY I WONDER MY BRAINS DID NOT THINK OF THAT LONG AGO
I'M SURE THE EMPEROR WILL RECEIVE US EVEN IN HIS PRESENT STATE THE EMPEROR'S STATE IS ALWAYS MAGNIFICENT SAID THE MAN
REPLIED THE SOLDIER STILL PALE WITH FEAR BUT WHERE WAS MY STANDING ARMY AT THE TIME INQUIRED HIS MAJESTY LOOKING AT THE SOLDIER GRAVELY YOUR STANDING ARMY WAS RUNNING ANSWERED THE FELLOW HONESTLY
BUT TELL ME HOW CAME YOUR MAJESTY HERE AND WHO ARE YOUR COMPANIONS THE SCARECROW WITH GREAT POLITENESS INTRODUCED TIP AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE LATTER PERSONAGE SEEMED TO INTEREST THE TIN WOODMAN GREATLY
BUT TIME IS PRECIOUS JUST NOW SO LET US QUICKLY MAKE PREPARATIONS TO START UPON OUR JOURNEY THE EMPEROR CALLED HIS LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR AND INSTRUCTED HIM HOW TO RUN THE KINGDOM DURING HIS ABSENCE MEANWHILE THE SCARECROW WAS TAKEN APART
FOR ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS PERCHED UPON THE WINDOW SILL GAVE A SCREAM AND FELL BACKWARD OUT THE WINDOW DRAWING HER COMPANION WITH HER AS SHE DISAPPEARED THE PROFESSOR UTTERED A CRY OF HORROR AND RUSHED AWAY THROUGH THE DOOR TO SEE IF THE POOR CHILDREN WERE INJURED BY THE FALL
THE CHILL NIGHTS RENDERED ME STIFF AND MOTIONLESS FOR I WORE NO CLOTHING BUT EACH MORNING THE WARM RAYS OF THE SUN GAVE ME NEW LIFE AND RESTORED ME TO ACTIVITY
NONSENSE EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW THEY'RE TOO BUSY TO COOK EVEN IF THEY KNOW HOW BUT SHOULD I REMAIN HERE A PRISONER FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME PROTESTED JACK I'M LIABLE TO SPOIL
AND THE ENGRAVED OIL CAN I BEGIN TO THINK
HE DOESN'T SEEM ESPECIALLY GRACEFUL HE REMARKED MUSINGLY BUT I SUPPOSE HE CAN RUN HE CAN INDEED SAID TIP GAZING UPON THE SAW HORSE ADMIRINGLY
TAILORS HAVING LIKE CATS NINE LIVES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE FELLOW WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL FOR HAD HE LOST THAT NINTH LIFE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM SO HE BEGGED PERMISSION TO FURNISH ME WITH THE STYLISH COSTUME I NOW WEAR
BUT PARDON ME IF I SEEM INQUISITIVE
FOR SHE NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL WHY NOT START COUNTING AT A HALF OF ONE ASKED THE SAW HORSE ABRUPTLY THEN ANYONE CAN COUNT UP TO SEVENTEEN BY TWOS VERY EASILY THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SURPRISE FOR THE SAW HORSE WAS CONSIDERED
IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE I COULD THINK OF YOUR MAJESTY ADDED THE SOLDIER FEARING HE HAD MADE A BLUNDER IT PLEASES ME VERY MUCH SAID THE SCARECROW HAS THE ANIMAL BEEN FED
HOW LARGE AN ARMY CAN YOU ASSEMBLE WE DO NOT NEED AN ARMY REPLIED THE WOODMAN WE FOUR WITH THE AID OF MY GLEAMING AXE ARE ENOUGH TO STRIKE TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THE REBELS WE FIVE CORRECTED THE PUMPKINHEAD FIVE
AND I ACQUIRED IN THIS WAY A FUND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL MYSELF CONFESS IS SIMPLY MARVELOUS THAT IS WHY I PLACE T E THOROUGHLY EDUCATED UPON MY CARDS
ARE YOUR SUBJECTS HAPPY AND CONTENTED MY DEAR FRIEND I CANNOT SAY WAS THE REPLY FOR THE GIRLS OF OZ HAVE RISEN IN REVOLT AND DRIVEN ME OUT OF THE EMERALD CITY GREAT GOODNESS CRIED THE TIN WOODMAN WHAT A CALAMITY
AND WE WILL MAKE A DASH TO LIBERTY OR TO DEATH THE COURTYARD IN WHICH THEY WERE STANDING WAS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE GREAT PALACE WHICH SURROUNDED IT ON ALL SIDES BUT IN ONE PLACE A PASSAGE LED TO AN OUTER GATEWAY
CRIED THE PROFESSOR IN A LOUD VOICE THIS HIGHLY MAGNIFIED WOGGLE BUG
KEEP QUIET COMMANDED TIP STERNLY VERY WELL DEAR FATHER ANSWERED THE OBEDIENT JACK THE WOGGLE BUG LISTENED PATIENTLY EVEN RESPECTFULLY TO THESE REMARKS AND THEN RESUMED HIS STORY
AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE FACED THEM WITH A MORE CHEERFUL EXPRESSION UPON HIS PAINTED FACE WHERE IS THE SAW HORSE YOU RODE HERE HE ASKED THE PUMPKINHEAD
IF I EVEN KNEW WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE I WOULD FIND HERE BUT WHOM SHALL I ASK THERE IS NO ONE HERE THE IDEA OF FINDING HIMSELF IN SO LONESOME A SPOT MADE HIM SO SAD
HE GRASPED THAT BUNDLE IN HIS MOUTH AND HOLDING IT LIGHTLY BETWEEN HIS TEETH RAN THROUGH THE DOOR AND DISAPPEARED LIKE A FLASH THE FISHERMAN ANGRY AT SEEING HIS MEAL SNATCHED FROM UNDER HIS NOSE RAN AFTER THE DOG
DO YOU KNOW THIS PINOCCHIO BY SIGHT ANSWERED THE MARIONETTE
LET ME TELL YOU WITHOUT KNOWING IT I RUBBED MYSELF AGAINST A NEWLY PAINTED WALL HE LIED ASHAMED TO SAY THAT HE HAD BEEN MADE READY FOR THE FRYING PAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOUR COAT AND YOUR HAT AND YOUR BREECHES I MET THIEVES AND THEY ROBBED ME
BUT THEY ALL ANSWERED AREN'T YOU ASHAMED INSTEAD OF BEING A BEGGAR IN THE STREETS WHY DON'T YOU LOOK FOR WORK AND EARN YOUR OWN BREAD
THEY STARTED TO THROW ALL KINDS OF BOOKS AT HIM READERS GEOGRAPHIES HISTORIES GRAMMARS FLEW IN ALL DIRECTIONS BUT PINOCCHIO WAS KEEN OF EYE AND SWIFT OF MOVEMENT AND THE BOOKS ONLY PASSED OVER HIS HEAD
CAME TO THE TOP OF THE WATER IN GREAT NUMBERS SOME TOOK A NIBBLE SOME TOOK A BITE BUT NO SOONER HAD THEY TASTED A PAGE OR TWO THAN THEY SPAT THEM OUT WITH A WRY FACE AS IF TO SAY
HE SEARCHED AND HE SEARCHED BUT HE SAW NOTHING EXCEPT SEA AND SKY AND FAR AWAY A FEW SAILS SO SMALL THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN BIRDS IF ONLY I KNEW THE NAME OF THIS ISLAND HE SAID TO HIMSELF
MINDFUL OF WHAT THE FISHERMAN HAD SAID PINOCCHIO KNEW THAT ALL HOPE OF BEING SAVED HAD GONE HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND WAITED FOR THE FINAL MOMENT
EITHER FROM PAIN OR WEAKNESS HE FELL TO THE FLOOR IN A DEAD FAINT WHEN HE REGAINED HIS SENSES HE FOUND HIMSELF STRETCHED OUT ON A SOFA AND THE FAIRY WAS SEATED NEAR HIM
AND WHO THREW IT A SCHOOLMATE OF HIS A CERTAIN PINOCCHIO AND WHO IS THIS PINOCCHIO ASKED THE MARIONETTE FEIGNING IGNORANCE THEY SAY HE IS A MISCHIEF MAKER A TRAMP A STREET URCHIN CALUMNIES ALL CALUMNIES
IN FACT HE WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT HE WENT ALONG TAKING TWO STEPS FORWARD AND ONE BACK AND AS HE WENT HE SAID TO HIMSELF HOW SHALL I EVER FACE MY GOOD LITTLE FAIRY WHAT WILL SHE SAY WHEN SHE SEES ME WILL SHE FORGIVE THIS LAST TRICK OF MINE I AM SURE SHE WON'T
ANSWERED THE DOG YOU SAVED ME ONCE AND WHAT IS GIVEN IS ALWAYS RETURNED WE ARE IN THIS WORLD TO HELP ONE ANOTHER BUT HOW DID YOU GET IN THAT CAVE I WAS LYING HERE ON THE SAND MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE
PINOCCHIO WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY ALL HIS FRIENDS AND SCHOOLMATES MUST BE INVITED TO CELEBRATE THE GREAT EVENT
BUT UNLUCKILY IN A MARIONETTE'S LIFE
EVEN IF ONE WERE TO SEARCH WITH A LANTERN NOT ONE IDLE MAN OR ONE TRAMP COULD HAVE BEEN FOUND I UNDERSTAND SAID PINOCCHIO AT ONCE WEARILY THIS IS NO PLACE FOR ME I WAS NOT BORN FOR WORK
AND PLACED BEFORE HIM THE BREAD THE CAULIFLOWER AND THE CAKE PINOCCHIO DID NOT EAT HE DEVOURED HIS STOMACH SEEMED A BOTTOMLESS PIT HIS HUNGER FINALLY APPEASED HE RAISED HIS HEAD TO THANK HIS KIND BENEFACTRESS
WHAT DOES THE TEACHER THINK OF US YOU MEAN WHY DON'T YOU SEE IF YOU STUDY AND WE DON'T WE PAY FOR IT AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY FAIR TO LOOK OUT FOR OURSELVES WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO HATE SCHOOL AND BOOKS
AND TEACHERS AS WE ALL DO THEY ARE YOUR WORST ENEMIES YOU KNOW AND THEY LIKE TO MAKE YOU AS UNHAPPY AS THEY CAN AND IF I GO ON STUDYING WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ME YOU'LL PAY FOR IT REALLY YOU AMUSE ME ANSWERED THE MARIONETTE NODDING HIS HEAD
PINOCCHIO WENT ON CRYING AND MOANING AND BEATING HIS HEAD AGAIN AND AGAIN HE CALLED TO HIS LITTLE FRIEND WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD HEAVY STEPS APPROACHING HE LOOKED UP AND SAW TWO TALL CARABINEERS NEAR HIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING STRETCHED OUT ON THE GROUND THEY ASKED PINOCCHIO
THEY SOMEHOW MANAGED TO GET HOLD OF IT ONE OF THE BOOKS WAS A VERY LARGE VOLUME AN ARITHMETIC TEXT HEAVILY BOUND IN LEATHER IT WAS PINOCCHIO'S PRIDE AMONG ALL HIS BOOKS HE LIKED THAT ONE THE BEST
THE HOUSE HAD FOUR STORIES OPENED AND PINOCCHIO SAW A LARGE SNAIL LOOK OUT A TINY LIGHT GLOWED ON TOP OF HER HEAD WHO KNOCKS AT THIS LATE HOUR SHE CALLED IS THE FAIRY HOME ASKED THE MARIONETTE
PINOCCHIO TRIED HIS BEST TO GET THERE BUT HE COULDN'T THE WAVES PLAYED WITH HIM AND TOSSED HIM ABOUT AS IF HE WERE A TWIG OR A BIT OF STRAW AT LAST AND LUCKILY FOR HIM A TREMENDOUS WAVE TOSSED HIM TO THE VERY SPOT WHERE HE WANTED TO BE
ANSWERED THE COAL MAN THEN MY BOY IF YOU ARE REALLY FAINT WITH HUNGER EAT TWO SLICES OF YOUR PRIDE AND I HOPE THEY DON'T GIVE YOU INDIGESTION A FEW MINUTES AFTER A BRICKLAYER PASSED BY CARRYING A PAIL FULL OF PLASTER ON HIS SHOULDER GOOD MAN
VERY WELL I'LL TAKE THE JUG HOME FOR YOU THE JUG WAS VERY HEAVY AND THE MARIONETTE NOT BEING STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY IT WITH HIS HANDS HAD TO PUT IT ON HIS HEAD WHEN THEY ARRIVED HOME THE LITTLE WOMAN MADE PINOCCHIO SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE
HAS HE FAINTED I SHOULD SAY SO SAID ONE OF THE CARABINEERS BENDING TO LOOK AT EUGENE THIS BOY HAS BEEN WOUNDED ON THE TEMPLE
THIS SAID HE TOOK THE PATH AT SO SWIFT A GAIT THAT HE SEEMED TO FLY AND AT EVERY SMALL SOUND HE HEARD HE TURNED IN FEAR TO SEE WHETHER THE TERRIBLE SHARK FIVE STORIES HIGH AND WITH A TRAIN IN HIS MOUTH WAS FOLLOWING HIM AFTER WALKING A HALF HOUR
TELL ME THAT IT IS YOU DON'T MAKE ME CRY ANY LONGER IF YOU ONLY KNEW I HAVE CRIED SO MUCH I HAVE SUFFERED SO
HE TOOK THE BAG WHICH HAPPENED TO BE EMPTY AND AFTER CUTTING A BIG HOLE AT THE TOP AND TWO AT THE SIDES HE SLIPPED INTO IT AS IF IT WERE A SHIRT LIGHTLY CLAD AS HE WAS HE STARTED OUT TOWARD THE VILLAGE ALONG THE WAY HE FELT VERY UNEASY
AND TWO HOURS ON A DREADFUL NIGHT LIKE THIS ARE AS LONG AS TWO YEARS HURRY PLEASE MY BOY ANSWERED THE SNAIL IN A CALM PEACEFUL VOICE MY DEAR BOY I AM A SNAIL AND SNAILS ARE NEVER
AT THIS SPEECH HIS NOSE RETURNED TO ITS NATURAL SIZE WHY ARE YOU SO PALE
EVEN WHEN HE RENDERED TO HER THOSE SERVICES OF WHICH AT THIS DAY WE FEEL THE HAPPY EFFECTS HER WELFARE WAS NOT HIS CHIEF OBJECT WHATEVER PATRIOTIC FEELING HE HAD WAS FOR HOLLAND
AND WHICH HAD TAKEN PART WITH THE CELTS IN THE REBELLION OF SIXTEEN FORTY ONE IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST NOTED SHARPERS AND BULLIES OF LONDON HE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO CHARLES AND JAMES WHEN THEY WERE EXILES IN FLANDERS
IF THEY REMINDED HIM LESS OF THE RITES OF THE CHURCH OF ROME HE HAD BEEN HEARD TO UTTER AN OMINOUS GROWL WHEN FIRST HE SAW IN HIS WIFE'S PRIVATE CHAPEL AN ALTAR DECKED AFTER THE ANGLICAN FASHION
A SPIRIT AS FIERCE AND DETERMINED AS HIS OWN AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT
SET HIM DOWN FOR THE WILDEST OF LIBERTINES THE MULTITUDE WAS UNABLE TO CONCEIVE THAT A MAN WHO EVEN WHEN SOBER WAS MORE FURIOUS AND BOASTFUL THAN OTHERS WHEN THEY WERE DRUNK
IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THE SENTIMENT WHICH GRADUALLY POSSESSED ITSELF OF WILLIAM'S WHOLE SOUL WHEN HE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A BOY HIS COUNTRY HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY LEWIS IN OSTENTATIOUS DEFIANCE OF JUSTICE AND PUBLIC LAW
WENT THROUGH THE FORM OF TENDERING HIS BEST SERVICES TO LEWIS BUT THIS CIVILITY WAS RATED AT ITS TRUE VALUE AND REQUITED WITH A DRY REPRIMAND THE GREAT KING AFFECTED CONTEMPT FOR THE PETTY PRINCE
THOUGH HE WAS AS YET IN CONFINEMENT ONLY FOR DEBT HE WAS PUT INTO IRONS BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE KING'S BENCH PRISON AND EVEN SO HE WAS WITH DIFFICULTY KEPT IN SAFE CUSTODY THE MASTIFF THAT GUARDED HIS DOOR WAS POISONED
THOUGH PURSUING ONE OBJECT VERY JUDICIOUSLY TOOK DIFFERENT PATHS THEY MADE A PARTITION OF THE COURT BONREPAUX LIVED CHIEFLY WITH ROCHESTER AND ROCHESTER'S ADHERENTS BARILLON'S CONNECTIONS
HENRY JERMYN WHOM JAMES HAD LATELY CREATED A PEER BY THE TITLE OF LORD DOVER JERMYN HAD BEEN DISTINGUISHED MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS BEFORE BY HIS VAGRANT AMOURS AND HIS DESPERATE DUELS HE WAS NOW RUINED BY PLAY
TO BE WELL PAID FOR HIS SERVICES AND SUCCEEDED IN ACQUIRING PARTLY BY THE SALE OF HIS INFLUENCE PARTLY BY GAMBLING AND PARTLY BY PIMPING AN ESTATE OF THREE THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FOR UNDER AN OUTWARD SHOW OF LEVITY PROFUSION
AND WAS EAGER TO RETRIEVE HIS FALLEN FORTUNES BY MEANS OF LUCRATIVE POSTS
AND EVEN FOR REPRIMANDS FROM VERSAILLES
AND HIS ACCENT WAS THAT OF HIS NATIVE GASCONY BUT HIS STRONG SENSE HIS KEEN PENETRATION AND HIS LIVELY WIT EMINENTLY QUALIFIED HIM FOR HIS POST
YET EVEN HIS AFFECTION FOR THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH WAS SUBORDINATE TO ANOTHER FEELING WHICH EARLY BECAME SUPREME IN HIS SOUL WHICH MIXED ITSELF WITH ALL HIS PASSIONS WHICH IMPELLED HIM TO MARVELLOUS ENTERPRISES WHICH SUPPORTED HIM
BUT WAS HEARD WITH ATTENTION ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS HE AFFECTED THE CHARACTER OF AN IRISH PATRIOT AND PLEADED WITH GREAT AUDACITY AND SOMETIMES WITH SUCCESS THE CAUSE OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHOSE ESTATES HAD BEEN CONFISCATED HE TOOK CARE HOWEVER
LEWIS POLITE AND DIGNIFIED PROFUSE AND VOLUPTUOUS FOND OF DISPLAY AND AVERSE FROM DANGER A MUNIFICENT PATRON OF ARTS AND LETTERS AND A CRUEL PERSECUTOR OF CALVINISTS
TALBOT WAS DESCENDED FROM AN OLD NORMAN FAMILY WHICH HAD BEEN LONG SETTLED IN LEINSTER WHICH HAD THERE SUNK INTO DEGENERACY WHICH HAD ADOPTED THE MANNERS OF THE CELTS WHICH HAD LIKE THE CELTS ADHERED TO THE OLD RELIGION
OCCUPIED ORANGE DISMANTLED THE FORTIFICATIONS AND CONFISCATED THE REVENUES WILLIAM DECLARED ALOUD AT HIS TABLE BEFORE MANY PERSONS THAT HE WOULD MAKE THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING REPENT THE OUTRAGE
AND HE OWNED IT WITHOUT A BLUSH THE INJURED LADY BECAME DUCHESS OF YORK HAD HER HUSBAND BEEN A MAN REALLY UPRIGHT AND HONOURABLE HE WOULD HAVE DRIVEN FROM HIS PRESENCE WITH INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT THE WRETCHES WHO HAD SLANDERED HER
WHICH ELAPSED BETWEEN THE DEATH OF CHARLES AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE VICEROYALTY OF CLARENDON WHEN THE NEW LORD LIEUTENANT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE LONDON FOR DUBLIN THE GENERAL WAS SUMMONED FROM DUBLIN TO LONDON DICK TALBOT
THE WORST OF MURDERERS TO THE GUILT OF SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD
IN NORTHUMBERLAND THE TRIUMPH OF SIR JOHN FENWICK A COURTIER WHOSE NAME AFTERWARDS OBTAINED A MELANCHOLY CELEBRITY WAS ATTENDED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EXCITED INTEREST IN LONDON
HE HAD SEEN WITH STILL DEEPER DISPLEASURE THE COUNTENANCE GIVEN BY A LARGE SECTION OF THAT PARTY TO THE PRETENSIONS OF MONMOUTH THE OPPOSITION IT SEEMED WISHED FIRST TO MAKE THE CROWN OF ENGLAND NOT WORTH THE WEARING
HE HAD A GREAT WORK TO DO AND TILL IT WAS DONE NOTHING COULD HARM HIM THEREFORE IT WAS THAT
HAPPILY FOR HIM HE WAS NOT PUT TO THE BAR TILL THE FIRST BURST OF POPULAR RAGE HAD SPENT ITSELF AND TILL THE CREDIT OF THE FALSE WITNESSES HAD BEEN BLOWN UPON HE HAD THEREFORE ESCAPED
HAD HEARD THAT A PERSECUTION OF SINGULAR BARBARITY HAD RAGED IN OUR ISLAND AGAINST THE PROFESSORS OF THE TRUE FAITH THAT MANY PIOUS MEN HAD SUFFERED MARTYRDOM AND THAT TITUS OATES HAD BEEN THE CHIEF MURDERER THERE WAS THEREFORE
THOUGH INCLOSED ON EVERY SIDE BY THE FRENCH TERRITORY WAS PROPERLY A FIEF NOT OF THE FRENCH BUT OF THE IMPERIAL CROWN LEWIS WITH THAT OSTENTATIOUS CONTEMPT OF PUBLIC LAW WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM
HE LOOKED ROUND FOR SUCCOUR AND LOOKED IN VAIN SPAIN WAS UNNERVED GERMANY DISTRACTED ENGLAND CORRUPTED NOTHING SEEMED LEFT TO THE YOUNG STADTHOLDER BUT TO PERISH SWORD IN HAND
HERE A SKELETON OF A REGIMENT MARCHING WITH A DESPERATE ATTEMPT AT ORDER THERE A RIOTOUS MOB OF MOBILES CRUSHING THEIR WAY TO THE STREETS THEN A TURMOIL OF HORSEMEN CANNON TROOPS WITHOUT OFFICERS OFFICERS WITHOUT MEN
PUSH IT OVER YOU MUST WITH LITTLE EFFORT BRAITH LIFTED THE BARRED COVER SCRAMBLED OUT ON HIS STOMACH AND EASILY RAISED COLETTE FROM WEST'S SHOULDERS QUICK OLD CHAP CRIED THE LATTER
A LANTERN BURNED IN THE CONCIERGE'S LODGE AND THE OLD MAN LAY DEAD BESIDE IT FAINT WITH FRIGHT HE LEANED A MOMENT ON HIS RIFLE THEN SNATCHING THE LANTERN SPRANG UP THE STAIRS HE TRIED TO CALL
AND I SEES YOU TOO YOU'D BETTER LEAVE HIM ALONE HE AIN'T NO OYSTER HE'S A ANGEL COME DOWN ON HIS OWN BUSINESS YOU BE OFF OR I'LL BE NEARER YOU THAN QUITE AGREEABLE THE DRUNKEN CABMAN WAS A TALL STOUT MAN
YOU GO IN TO YOUR MOTHER DIAMOND I'LL PUT UP THE OLD OSS I'LL TAKE CARE ON HIM
IT'LL HELP FATHER TO GET WELL AGAIN IT WILL I HOPE IT MAY MY MAN I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU'RE AS GOOD AS YOU LOOK AFTER ALL AS DIAMOND RETURNED
AND HOW PLEASED HE WAS IT DID HIM NO END OF GOOD BUT WHILE HE WAS COUNTING THE COINS
THEIRS THE DOOR HUNG FROM ITS HINGES THE WALLS GAPED HE CREPT IN AND SANK DOWN BY THE BED AND THERE TWO ARMS WERE FLUNG AROUND HIS NECK AND A TEAR STAINED FACE SOUGHT HIS OWN
BUT WITH THE CHAIR HE MANAGED IT IF OLD DIAMOND HAD HAD AN EDUCATION IN PHYSICS TO EQUAL THAT OF THE CAMEL HE WOULD HAVE KNELT DOWN TO LET HIM PUT IT ON HIS BACK BUT THAT WAS MORE THAN COULD BE EXPECTED OF HIM
AND THE THRONG AT THE GATES PARTED SILENTLY AS THE TROOPS TRAMPED ALONG THE FREEZING STREETS CONFUSION CAME AS THE HOURS PASSED SWIFTLY AND MORE SWIFTLY CROWDING SQUADRON AFTER SQUADRON AND BATTERY ON BATTERY
QUARTER BRAITH WAS PAINTING IN BED WHEN WEST CAME IN VERY MUCH SCARED I WISH YOU WOULD COME DOWN OUR HOUSE HAS BEEN KNOCKED INTO A COCKED HAT
AND WAS IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO THINK ABOUT THE DRIVER HAVING CARRIED HIM TO KING'S CROSS IN GOOD TIME AND GOT A GOOD FARE IN RETURN HE SET OFF AGAIN IN GREAT SPIRITS AND REACHED THE STAND IN SAFETY HE WAS THE FIRST THERE AFTER ALL
DIAMOND HAD RESOLVED TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE CAB STAND WHERE HE WAS BEST KNOWN AND NEVER TO CRAWL FOR FEAR OF GETTING ANNOYED BY IDLERS BEFORE HE GOT ACROSS OXFORD STREET HOWEVER HE WAS HAILED BY A MAN WHO WANTED TO CATCH A TRAIN
AND I'M AFRAID THAT SOME OF THE PILLAGERS MAY TAKE IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO PAY US A VISIT TO NIGHT BRAITH JUMPED OUT OF BED AND BUNDLED HIMSELF INTO A GARMENT WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN AN OVERCOAT ANYBODY HURT
BUT THEY WOULD NOT LET HIM GO WITHOUT A GENERAL INSPECTION OF THE HARNESS AND ALTHOUGH THEY FOUND IT RIGHT FOR NOT A BUCKLE HAD TO BE SHIFTED THEY NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO DO IT FOR HIMSELF AGAIN ALL THE TIME HIS FATHER WAS ILL
IN A FEW MINUTES A GROUP OF IDLE BOYS HAD ASSEMBLED AND DIAMOND FOUND HIMSELF IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION ANOTHER CAB DREW UP AT THE STAND AND THE DRIVER GOT OFF AND APPROACHED THE ASSEMBLAGE
THERE THAT VAN'S A MOVING NOW JUMP UP THE POLICEMAN DID AS DIAMOND TOLD HIM AND WAS SOON SATISFIED THAT THE LITTLE FELLOW COULD DRIVE WELL HE SAID AS HE GOT DOWN AGAIN
HE INQUIRED STRUGGLING WITH A SLEEVE FULL OF DILAPIDATED LINING NO COLETTE IS BARRICADED IN THE CELLAR AND THE CONCIERGE RAN AWAY TO THE FORTIFICATIONS THERE WILL BE A ROUGH GANG THERE IF THE BOMBARDMENT KEEPS UP YOU MIGHT HELP US
THEN AGAIN A LINE OF AMBULANCES THE WHEELS GROANING UNDER THEIR HEAVY LOADS DUMB WITH MISERY THE CROWD LOOKED ON ALL THROUGH THE DAY THE AMBULANCES HAD BEEN ARRIVING
NOW WHEN DIAMOND HAD ONLY TO GO STRAIGHT AHEAD AND HAD NOT TO MIND SO MUCH WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HIS THOUGHTS ALWAYS TURNED TO THE RIDDLE MISTER RAYMOND HAD SET HIM
RETURNED DIAMOND I'M SORRY I COULDN'T FIND IT OUT MYSELF MISTER RAYMOND WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PLEASED WITH ME BUT YOU NEEDN'T TELL HIM ANY ONE TOLD YOU
SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WAS ALMOST AFRAID WHEN SHE DID HEAR THE SOUND OF HIS CAB TO GO AND LOOK LEST SHE SHOULD BE YET AGAIN DISAPPOINTED AND SHOULD BREAK DOWN BEFORE HER HUSBAND BUT THERE WAS THE OLD HORSE AND THERE WAS THE CAB ALL RIGHT
ON THE CORNER A FIRE BLAZED LIGHTING UP HIS OWN STREET AND ON THE BANK WALL BENEATH A SHATTERED GAS LAMP A CHILD WAS WRITING WITH A BIT OF CINDER HERE FELL THE FIRST SHELL
WHEN HE GOT INTO THE YARD HE FOUND THE STABLE DOOR JUST OPENED I'M THE EARLY BIRD I THINK HE SAID TO HIMSELF I HOPE I SHALL CATCH THE WORM HE WOULD NOT ASK ANY ONE TO HELP HIM
OR IF HE DID HE WOULD ONLY RUN HOME WELL YOU'RE A PLUCKY ONE FOR ALL YOUR GIRL'S LOOKS
THEN HER NERVES GAVE WAY AND SHE WEPT HYSTERICALLY BUT WEST THREW HIS ARM AROUND HER AND LED HER ACROSS THE GARDENS INTO THE NEXT STREET WHERE BRAITH AFTER REPLACING THE MAN HOLE COVER AND PILING SOME STONE SLABS FROM THE WALL OVER IT
THAT THE LATTER CRIED HAVE YOU SEEN JACK TRENT TO DAY NO REPLIED BRAITH LOOKING TROUBLED HE WAS NOT AT AMBULANCE HEADQUARTERS HE STAYED TO TAKE CARE OF SYLVIA I SUPPOSE
DON'T YOU THINK I HAD BETTER RUN UP TO SEE IF JACK AND SYLVIA ARE WELL ENTRENCHED I CAN GET BACK BEFORE DARK NO GO IN AND FIND COLETTE AND I'LL GO NO NO LET ME GO THERE'S NO DANGER
IT AMUSED HER TO OBSERVE THAT ALL HER FRIENDS SEEMED DETERMINED TO SEND HER TO DELAFORD A PLACE IN WHICH OF ALL OTHERS SHE WOULD NOW LEAST CHUSE TO VISIT OR WISH TO RESIDE
PETER AND THE STORY GIRL KNEW ALL ABOUT THEM AND IMPARTED THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO US GENEROUSLY I RECALL PETER STANDING ON THE PULPIT STONE ONE NIGHT ERE MOONRISE AND POINTING THEM OUT TO US
CRIED THE BOYS FROM THE ORCHESTRA SADDENED BY THE ACCIDENT NO ONE SAW PINOCCHIO AGAIN THAT EVENING THE NEXT MORNING THE VETERINARY THAT IS THE ANIMAL DOCTOR DECLARED THAT HE WOULD BE LAME FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
THE OPENNESS AND HEARTINESS OF HER MANNER MORE THAN ATONED FOR THAT WANT OF RECOLLECTION AND ELEGANCE WHICH MADE HER OFTEN DEFICIENT IN THE FORMS OF POLITENESS HER KINDNESS RECOMMENDED BY SO PRETTY A FACE WAS ENGAGING HER FOLLY
WELL WHAT IS THE REASON ASKED FELICITY BECAUSE THERE'S MORE OF THEM SAID FELIX GRINNING I FORGET WHAT WE DID TO FELIX
SINCE FELIX SOLEMNLY VOWED CROSS HIS HEART WHITE SHEEP DID EAT MORE THAN BLACK
THERE IN FRONT OF HIM IN A BOX SAT A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AROUND HER NECK SHE WORE A LONG GOLD CHAIN FROM WHICH HUNG A LARGE MEDALLION ON THE MEDALLION WAS PAINTED THE PICTURE OF A MARIONETTE
AND AS HE DID THERE CAME RUSHING OVER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE A GREAT COMPANY THE BAND OF FELLOW TRAVELLERS BUT ALL WERE TOO LATE TO WIN THE DOUBLE BOON VING HAD WON TO IT THROUGH THE DANGER AND SUFFERING OF THE DARK RIVER
WE STOPPED PICKING APPLES SAT DOWN ON THE GRASS AND TRIED TO REASON IT OUT
SHE WAS PLEASED TO BE FREE HERSELF FROM THE PERSECUTION OF LUCY'S FRIENDSHIP SHE WAS GRATEFUL FOR BRINGING HER SISTER AWAY UNSEEN BY WILLOUGHBY SINCE HIS MARRIAGE AND SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH HOPE TO WHAT A FEW MONTHS OF TRANQUILITY AT BARTON MIGHT DO TOWARDS RESTORING MARIANNE'S PEACE OF MIND
WHERE THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE SPRANG UP IN A SHOWER OF DIAMOND FIRE BUT UNDER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE ROLLED A TERRIBLE FLOOD DEEP AND WIDE AND VIOLENT FULL OF ROCKS AND RAPIDS AND WHIRLPOOLS
AND EVEN TO STAND ON YOUR HEAD POOR PINOCCHIO WHETHER HE LIKED IT OR NOT HAD TO LEARN ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS BUT IT TOOK HIM THREE LONG MONTHS AND COST HIM MANY MANY LASHINGS BEFORE HE WAS PRONOUNCED PERFECT
PINOCCHIO TRIED TWO OR THREE TIMES BUT EACH TIME HE CAME NEAR THE RING HE FOUND IT MORE TO HIS TASTE TO GO UNDER IT THE FOURTH TIME AT A LOOK FROM HIS MASTER HE LEAPED THROUGH IT BUT AS HE DID SO
HE HAD EATEN IT ALL DURING THE NIGHT HE TRIED THE STRAW BUT AS HE CHEWED AWAY AT IT HE NOTICED TO HIS GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT THAT IT TASTED NEITHER LIKE RICE NOR LIKE MACARONI PATIENCE HE REPEATED AS HE CHEWED
AS SOON AS THE BUYER HAD PAID THE FOUR CENTS THE DONKEY CHANGED HANDS HIS NEW OWNER TOOK HIM TO A HIGH CLIFF OVERLOOKING THE SEA PUT A STONE AROUND HIS NECK TIED A ROPE TO ONE OF HIS HIND FEET GAVE HIM A PUSH
THE MOUNTAIN ASH AND THE ACACIA AND A THICK SCREEN OF THEM ALTOGETHER INTERSPERSED WITH TALL LOMBARDY POPLARS SHUT OUT THE OFFICES MARIANNE ENTERED THE HOUSE WITH A HEART SWELLING WITH EMOTION
AND EAGER AS SHE HAD LONG BEEN TO QUIT IT COULD NOT WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT BID ADIEU TO THE HOUSE IN WHICH SHE HAD FOR THE LAST TIME ENJOYED THOSE HOPES AND THAT CONFIDENCE IN WILLOUGHBY WHICH WERE NOW EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER WITHOUT GREAT PAIN
A SHOWER CAME UP IN THE EVENING AND WE HAD TO STOP PICKING AFTER THE SHOWER THERE WAS A MAGNIFICENT DOUBLE RAINBOW WE WATCHED IT FROM THE GRANARY WINDOW AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US AN OLD LEGEND CULLED
UNCLE ROGER SAYS PETER'S FATHER WASN'T EXACTLY LAZY SAID THE STORY GIRL THE TROUBLE WAS THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER THINGS HE LIKED BETTER THAN WORK
THERE WAS A WARDER OF THE BRIDGE A GOD DARK AND STERN AND SORROWFUL AND TO HIM ODIN GAVE COMMAND THAT HE SHOULD OPEN THE GATE AND ALLOW HIS FOLLOWERS TO CROSS THE RAINBOW BRIDGE
FOR HIS BEAUTY AND STRENGTH AND GOODNESS ALWAYS HE WALKED ON ODIN'S RIGHT HAND AND ALWAYS THE FIRST LIGHT OF ODIN'S SMILE FELL ON HIM
THE MOST FAMOUS DONKEY IN THE WORLD A DONKEY THAT HAS HAD THE GREAT HONOR IN HIS SHORT LIFE OF PERFORMING BEFORE THE KINGS AND QUEENS AND EMPERORS OF ALL THE GREAT COURTS OF EUROPE WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
GREAT SPECTACLE TONIGHT LEAPS AND EXERCISES BY THE GREAT ARTISTS AND THE FAMOUS HORSES OF THE COMPANY FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE OF THE FAMOUS DONKEY CALLED PINOCCHIO THE STAR OF THE DANCE
AND HERE I AM ON HEARING THIS THE TWO DONKEYS BOWED THEIR HEADS IN SHAME
AND CONFIRMING HER OWN THEIR JOURNEY WAS SAFELY PERFORMED THE SECOND DAY BROUGHT THEM INTO THE CHERISHED OR THE PROHIBITED COUNTY OF SOMERSET FOR AS SUCH WAS IT DWELT ON BY TURNS IN MARIANNE'S IMAGINATION
OBSERVE I BEG OF YOU THE SAVAGE LOOK OF HIS EYE ALL THE MEANS USED BY CENTURIES OF CIVILIZATION IN SUBDUING WILD BEASTS FAILED IN THIS CASE I HAD FINALLY TO RESORT TO THE GENTLE LANGUAGE OF THE WHIP
AFTER PUTTING HIM IN A STABLE HIS NEW MASTER FILLED HIS MANGER WITH STRAW BUT PINOCCHIO AFTER TASTING A MOUTHFUL SPAT IT OUT THEN THE MAN FILLED THE MANGER WITH HAY
JUST THINK HOW DREADFUL IT WOULD BE IF OUR FATHER HAD LEFT US LIKE THAT OUR FATHER IS A KING SAID FELICITY LOFTILY AND PETER'S FATHER WAS ONLY A CRAIG A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY COULDN'T BEHAVE LIKE THAT
THE NEXT DAY HE COMPLAINED OF HEADACHE AND SORE THROAT AND SEEMED TO PREFER LYING ON AUNT OLIVIA'S KITCHEN SOFA TO DOING ANY WORK AS IT WAS NOT IN PETER TO BE A MALINGERER HE WAS LEFT IN PEACE WHILE WE PICKED APPLES
I OPENED MY ANTECHAMBERS AND THEY CROWDED IN I DO NOT KNOW HOW FAR HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN SAYING SO NOT IN THE LEAST REPLIED THE VICOMTE AFTER THE MURDER OF THE DUC
THAT WAS HORRIBLE SAID THE LITTLE PRINCESS SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS HE'S A LOW FELLOW SAY WHAT YOU WILL REMARKED PRINCE HIPPOLYTE PIERRE NOT KNOWING WHOM TO ANSWER LOOKED AT THEM ALL AND SMILED
CERTAINLY BUT ABOUT KUTUZOV I DON'T PROMISE DO PROMISE DO PROMISE VASILI CRIED ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA AS HE WENT WITH THE SMILE OF A COQUETTISH GIRL WHICH AT ONE TIME PROBABLY CAME NATURALLY TO HER BUT WAS NOW VERY ILL SUITED TO HER CAREWORN FACE
EVERYONE WAITED SO EMPHATICALLY AND EAGERLY DID HE DEMAND THEIR ATTENTION TO HIS STORY THERE IS IN MOSCOW A LADY UNE DAME AND SHE IS VERY STINGY SHE MUST HAVE TWO FOOTMEN BEHIND HER CARRIAGE
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO WHAT YOU ASK BUT TO PROVE MY DEVOTION TO YOU AND HOW I RESPECT YOUR FATHER'S MEMORY I WILL DO THE IMPOSSIBLE YOUR SON SHALL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GUARDS HERE IS MY HAND ON IT ARE YOU SATISFIED MY DEAR BENEFACTOR
ON THE CONTRARY WE WANTED LIBERTY BUT BUONAPARTE HAS DESTROYED IT PRINCE ANDREW KEPT LOOKING WITH AN AMUSED SMILE FROM PIERRE TO THE VICOMTE AND FROM THE VICOMTE TO THEIR HOSTESS
HIS DAUGHTER PRINCESS HELENE PASSED BETWEEN THE CHAIRS LIGHTLY HOLDING UP THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS AND THE SMILE SHONE STILL MORE RADIANTLY ON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE PIERRE GAZED AT HER WITH RAPTUROUS ALMOST FRIGHTENED EYES AS SHE PASSED HIM
SAID THE LITTLE PRINCESS
THE ITALIAN'S FACE INSTANTLY CHANGED AND ASSUMED AN OFFENSIVELY AFFECTED SUGARY EXPRESSION EVIDENTLY HABITUAL TO HIM WHEN CONVERSING WITH WOMEN I AM SO ENCHANTED BY THE BRILLIANCY OF THE WIT AND CULTURE OF THE SOCIETY
EMANCIPATION FROM PREJUDICES AND EQUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP AND ALL THESE IDEAS NAPOLEON HAS RETAINED IN FULL FORCE LIBERTY AND EQUALITY SAID THE VICOMTE CONTEMPTUOUSLY AS IF
THE VICOMTE BOWED AND SMILED COURTEOUSLY IN TOKEN OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO COMPLY ANNA PAVLOVNA ARRANGED A GROUP ROUND HIM INVITING EVERYONE TO LISTEN TO HIS TALE
WITH SOFT FEATURES AND POLISHED MANNERS WHO EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED HIMSELF A CELEBRITY BUT OUT OF POLITENESS MODESTLY PLACED HIMSELF AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE CIRCLE IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF
PRINCE HIPPOLYTE WHO HAD BEEN GAZING AT THE VICOMTE FOR SOME TIME THROUGH HIS LORGNETTE SUDDENLY TURNED COMPLETELY ROUND TOWARD THE LITTLE PRINCESS AND HAVING ASKED FOR A NEEDLE
THE PEOPLE ONLY GAVE HIM POWER THAT HE MIGHT RID THEM OF THE BOURBONS AND BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT HE WAS A GREAT MAN THE REVOLUTION WAS A GRAND THING CONTINUED MONSIEUR PIERRE BETRAYING BY THIS DESPERATE AND PROVOCATIVE PROPOSITION
PRINCE ANDREW LOOKED ANNA PAVLOVNA STRAIGHT IN THE FACE WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE DIEU ME LA DONNE
AN EMBITTERED LOOK CLOUDED HER ONCE HANDSOME FACE BUT ONLY FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE SMILED AGAIN AND CLUTCHED PRINCE VASILI'S ARM MORE TIGHTLY
BY INTRIGUES VIOLENCE EXILE AND EXECUTIONS FRENCH SOCIETY I MEAN GOOD FRENCH SOCIETY WILL HAVE BEEN FOREVER DESTROYED AND THEN
SO ANNA PAVLOVNA SERVED UP TO HER GUESTS FIRST THE VICOMTE AND THEN THE ABBE AS PECULIARLY CHOICE MORSELS THE GROUP ABOUT MORTEMART IMMEDIATELY BEGAN DISCUSSING THE MURDER OF THE DUC D'ENGHIEN
AT THE PRESENT TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW THE REAL STATE OF FRENCH PUBLIC OPINION BONAPARTE HAS SAID SO REMARKED PRINCE ANDREW WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE DID NOT LIKE THE VICOMTE
MY DEAR BENEFACTOR PAPA SAID HIS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER IN THE SAME TONE AS BEFORE WE SHALL BE LATE WELL AU REVOIR GOOD BYE YOU HEAR HER THEN TOMORROW YOU WILL SPEAK TO THE EMPEROR
AND TOOK HIS ARM BEFORE HE LOOKED ROUND PRINCE ANDREW FROWNED AGAIN EXPRESSING HIS ANNOYANCE WITH WHOEVER WAS TOUCHING HIS ARM BUT WHEN HE SAW PIERRE'S BEAMING FACE HE GAVE HIM AN UNEXPECTEDLY KIND AND PLEASANT SMILE
NAPOLEON IS GREAT BECAUSE HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THE REVOLUTION SUPPRESSED ITS ABUSES PRESERVED ALL THAT WAS GOOD IN IT EQUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND OF THE PRESS AND ONLY FOR THAT REASON DID HE OBTAIN POWER
HAD LEFT HER KINDLY AND TEAR WORN FACE AND IT NOW EXPRESSED ONLY ANXIETY AND FEAR HOW ABOUT MY SON BORIS PRINCE
MORE ESPECIALLY OF THE FEMININE SOCIETY
AND BY THE WONDERFUL CLASSIC BEAUTY OF HER FIGURE HIS FACE ON THE CONTRARY WAS DULLED BY IMBECILITY AND A CONSTANT EXPRESSION OF SULLEN SELF CONFIDENCE WHILE HIS BODY WAS THIN AND WEAK HIS EYES NOSE AND MOUTH
ONE MUST ADMIT CONTINUED PRINCE ANDREW THAT NAPOLEON AS A MAN WAS GREAT ON THE BRIDGE OF ARCOLA AND IN THE HOSPITAL AT JAFFA WHERE HE GAVE HIS HAND TO THE PLAGUE STRICKEN
WHICH IN THE FASHION OF THOSE DAYS WERE VERY MUCH EXPOSED AND SHE SEEMED TO BRING THE GLAMOUR OF A BALLROOM WITH HER AS SHE MOVED TOWARD ANNA PAVLOVNA HELENE WAS SO LOVELY THAT NOT ONLY DID SHE NOT SHOW ANY TRACE OF COQUETRY
COME OVER HERE HELENE DEAR SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA TO THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PRINCESS WHO WAS SITTING SOME WAY OFF THE CENTER OF ANOTHER GROUP THE PRINCESS SMILED SHE ROSE WITH THE SAME UNCHANGING SMILE WITH WHICH SHE HAD FIRST ENTERED THE ROOM
THE LITTLE PRINCESS HAD ALSO LEFT THE TEA TABLE AND FOLLOWED HELENE WAIT A MOMENT I'LL GET MY WORK
THE WHOLE COMPANY HAD SETTLED INTO THREE GROUPS ONE CHIEFLY MASCULINE HAD FORMED ROUND THE ABBE ANOTHER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WAS GROUPED ROUND THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS HELENE PRINCE VASILI'S DAUGHTER
THE VICOMTE KNEW THE DUC PERSONALLY WHISPERED ANNA PAVLOVNA TO ONE OF THE GUESTS THE VICOMTE IS A WONDERFUL RACONTEUR SAID SHE TO ANOTHER HOW EVIDENTLY HE BELONGS TO THE BEST SOCIETY
BOTH THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW BUT NO ONE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT IT BEFORE SHE ARRIVED IN HER OWN KINGDOM NO ONE NOT EVEN MY SHADOW SAID THE SHADOW AND HE HAD HIS OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT IT
WELL THEN GO BUT DON'T STAY AWAY THE STRANGER ROSE AND HIS SHADOW ON THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S BALCONY ROSE ALSO
I DID NOT GO QUITE IN I REMAINED IN THE FOREMOST ROOM IN THE TWILIGHT BUT I STOOD THERE QUITE WELL I SAW EVERYTHING AND I KNOW EVERYTHING I HAVE BEEN IN THE ANTECHAMBER AT THE COURT OF POESY
THE NARROW STREET WITH THE HIGH HOUSES WAS BUILT SO THAT THE SUNSHINE MUST FALL THERE FROM MORNING TILL EVENING IT WAS REALLY NOT TO BE BORNE THE LEARNED MAN FROM THE COLD LANDS HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
AND THAT ONE MUST ALWAYS DO AND WHAT DIDST THOU THEN SEE ASKED THE LEARNED MAN I SAW EVERYTHING AND I SHALL TELL ALL TO YOU BUT IT IS NO PRIDE ON MY PART AS A FREE MAN AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE
AND THE SHADOW ALSO TURNED ROUND YES IF ANYONE HAD PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO IT THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN QUITE DISTINCTLY THAT THE SHADOW WENT IN THROUGH THE HALF OPEN BALCONY DOOR OF THEIR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR
SAID THE SHADOW AND THEN HE SAT WITH THE POLISHED BOOTS AS HEAVILY AS HE COULD ON THE ARM OF THE LEARNED MAN'S NEW SHADOW WHICH LAY LIKE A POODLE DOG AT HIS FEET NOW THIS WAS PERHAPS FROM ARROGANCE
NAY IS IT REALLY THOU SAID THE LEARNED MAN IT IS MOST REMARKABLE I NEVER IMAGINED THAT ONE'S OLD SHADOW COULD COME AGAIN AS A MAN TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO PAY SAID THE SHADOW
WHAT A MAN THAT MUST BE WHO HAS SO WISE A SHADOW THOUGHT SHE IT WILL BE A REAL BLESSING TO MY PEOPLE AND KINGDOM IF I CHOOSE HIM FOR MY CONSORT I WILL DO IT THEY WERE SOON AGREED
AND HE THOUGHT THAT A STRANGE LUSTRE CAME FROM THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ALL THE FLOWERS SHONE LIKE FLAMES IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND IN THE MIDST OF THE FLOWERS STOOD A SLENDER GRACEFUL MAIDEN
YOU SEE THAT IT IS A FEELING THAT IT IS NOT PRIDE I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO SAY THOU TO ME BUT I WILL WILLINGLY SAY THOU TO YOU SO IT IS HALF DONE SO THE SHADOW SAID THOU TO ITS FORMER MASTER
AND OF THE MANY PERSONS SHE WOULD HAVE TO REIGN OVER HE IS A WISE MAN
THIS IS RATHER TOO BAD THOUGHT HE THAT I MUST SAY YOU AND HE SAY THOU BUT HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PUT UP WITH IT SO THEY CAME TO A WATERING PLACE WHERE THERE WERE MANY STRANGERS
IT WAS FIRST TOWARDS EVENING WHEN THE SUN WAS DOWN THAT THEY BEGAN TO FRESHEN UP AGAIN IN THE WARM LANDS EVERY WINDOW HAS A BALCONY AND THE PEOPLE CAME OUT ON ALL THE BALCONIES IN THE STREET
WAS IT THERE AS IN THE FRESH WOODS WAS IT THERE AS IN A HOLY CHURCH WERE THE SALOONS LIKE THE STARLIT FIRMAMENT WHEN WE STAND ON THE HIGH MOUNTAINS EVERYTHING WAS THERE SAID THE SHADOW
AND THOU WILT GO TO PRISON AND THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO FOR THE SENTINELS OBEYED HIM WHOM THEY KNEW THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS TO MARRY YOU TREMBLE SAID THE PRINCESS AS THE SHADOW CAME INTO HER CHAMBER
BUT THE ONE DOOR STOOD OPEN DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE OTHER THROUGH A LONG ROW OF ROOMS AND SALOONS AND THERE IT WAS LIGHTED UP I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY KILLED IF I HAD GONE OVER TO THE MAIDEN BUT I WAS CIRCUMSPECT I TOOK TIME TO THINK
THEN THE SHADOW CAME AGAIN HOW GOES IT SAID THE SHADOW ALAS SAID THE LEARNED MAN I WRITE ABOUT THE TRUE AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL BUT NO ONE CARES TO HEAR SUCH THINGS I AM QUITE DESPERATE
I RAN UP AND RAN DOWN PEEPED INTO THE HIGHEST WINDOWS INTO THE SALOONS AND ON THE ROOFS I PEEPED IN WHERE NO ONE COULD PEEP AND I SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD SEE
THE DIN OF CARRIAGES DRIVING AND COMPANY ARRIVING YES IT WAS IN TRUTH LIVELY ENOUGH DOWN IN THE STREET
ONE EVENING AS HE WAS SITTING IN HIS ROOM THERE WAS A GENTLE KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
THEY GREW SO WELL IN THE SUN'S HEAT AND THAT THEY COULD NOT DO UNLESS THEY WERE WATERED AND SOME ONE MUST WATER THEM THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE THE DOOR OPPOSITE WAS ALSO OPENED LATE IN THE EVENING
I WILL NOT SAY FOR A CERTAINTY THAT HE CAN SAID THE SHADOW BUT I THINK SO HE HAS NOW FOLLOWED ME FOR SO MANY YEARS AND LISTENED TO MY CONVERSATION I SHOULD THINK IT POSSIBLE
WITH PARENTS AND WITH THE SWEET MATCHLESS CHILDREN I SAW SAID THE SHADOW WHAT NO HUMAN BEING MUST KNOW BUT WHAT THEY WOULD ALL SO WILLINGLY KNOW WHAT IS BAD IN THEIR NEIGHBOR
THE LIGHT BURNT IN THE ROOM BEHIND HIM AND THUS IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT HIS SHADOW SHOULD FALL ON HIS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S WALL YES THERE IT SAT DIRECTLY OPPOSITE BETWEEN THE FLOWERS ON THE BALCONY
I TELL YOU I WAS THERE AND YOU CAN CONCEIVE THAT I SAW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO BE SEEN HAD YOU COME OVER THERE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MAN BUT I BECAME SO AND BESIDES
THE WOMAN DIDN'T THINK HOW MUCH SHE CONCEALED I WENT OUT FIRST IN THE EVENING I RAN ABOUT THE STREETS IN THE MOONLIGHT I MADE MYSELF LONG UP THE WALLS IT TICKLES THE BACK SO DELIGHTFULLY
OR PASHAS IN EGYPT WITH HIM WAS HIS BROTHER IN LAW LATELY COME FROM CANADA A BIG AND RATHER BOISTEROUS YOUNG GENTLEMAN FARMER WITH A YELLOW BEARD BY NAME JAMES BLOUNT
OH DON'T JUMP MISTER CROOK SHE CALLED OUT IN SOME ALARM IT'S MUCH TOO HIGH THE INDIVIDUAL RIDING THE PARTY WALL LIKE AN AERIAL HORSE
OR SOMETHING BLUE BEARD'S MORE IN MY LINE AND HIM I LIKE BEST WHEN HE TURNED INTO THE PANTALOON I'M ALL FOR MAKING A POLICEMAN INTO SAUSAGES SAID JOHN CROOK
ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE STOOD THE STABLE ON THE OTHER AN ALLEY OR CLOISTER OF LAURELS LED TO THE LARGER GARDEN BEHIND THE YOUNG LADY HAVING SCATTERED BREAD FOR THE BIRDS
AMONG THE LIGHTS AND SCREENS OF THE CAFE RICHE THUS IN ENGLAND IF I WISHED TO RELIEVE A DEAN OF HIS RICHES WHICH IS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE I WISHED TO FRAME HIM
SHE SAID AND LEFT THE STRING OF SAUSAGES SWINGING FATHER BROWN THOUGH HE KNEW EVERY DETAIL DONE BEHIND THE SCENES AND HAD EVEN EVOKED APPLAUSE BY HIS TRANSFORMATION OF A PILLOW INTO A PANTOMIME BABY
BUT HER FIGURE WAS BEYOND CONJECTURE FOR SHE WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN BROWN FURS THAT IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHICH WAS HAIR AND WHICH WAS FUR BUT FOR THE ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SMALL TODDLING BEAR
HE'S A JOURNALIST AND KNOWS ALL THE OLDEST JOKES I CAN BE HARLEQUIN THAT ONLY WANTS LONG LEGS AND JUMPING ABOUT MY FRIEND FLORIAN PHONES HE'S BRINGING THE POLICE COSTUME HE'S CHANGING ON THE WAY
I HAD TO BE CAREFUL OF EM COMING DOWN THEY'RE THE THREE GREAT AFRICAN DIAMONDS CALLED THE FLYING STARS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN STOLEN SO OFTEN ALL THE BIG CRIMINALS ARE ON THE TRACK
AND BEGAN TO UNPACK HIM LIKE SOME VERY CAREFULLY PROTECTED PARCEL RUGS ENOUGH TO STOCK A BAZAAR FURS OF ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST AND SCARVES OF ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
THAT FAMOUS FRENCH ACROBAT AND COMIC ACTOR I KNEW HIM YEARS AGO OUT WEST HE WAS A FRENCH CANADIAN BY BIRTH AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE BUSINESS FOR ME THOUGH I HARDLY GUESS WHAT
WERE UNWRAPPED ONE BY ONE TILL THEY REVEALED SOMETHING RESEMBLING THE HUMAN FORM THE FORM OF A FRIENDLY BUT FOREIGN LOOKING OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A GREY GOAT LIKE BEARD AND A BEAMING SMILE
THIS SHOWED THE MORE PLAINLY BECAUSE HE WORE AN AGGRESSIVE RED TIE THE ONLY PART OF HIS COSTUME OF WHICH HE SEEMED TO TAKE ANY CARE PERHAPS IT WAS A SYMBOL
I REPENTED THE SAME EVENING FLAMBEAU WOULD THEN PROCEED TO TELL THE STORY FROM THE INSIDE AND EVEN FROM THE INSIDE IT WAS ODD SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE
FISCHER STOOD BEAMING BENEVOLENTLY AND DRINKING DEEP OF THE ASTONISHMENT AND ECSTASY OF THE GIRL THE GRIM ADMIRATION AND GRUFF THANKS OF THE COLONEL THE WONDER OF THE WHOLE GROUP
YOU SEE AN ENGLISH INTERIOR OPEN A MOONLIT GARDEN IT ALL GOES BY MAGIC AND SNATCHING A CHANCE PIECE OF BILLIARD CHALK FROM HIS POCKET HE RAN IT ACROSS THE HALL FLOOR
DON'T LET'S QUARREL THERE ARE LOWER JOKES THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT DISLIKE OF THE RED TIED YOUTH BORN OF HIS PREDATORY OPINIONS AND EVIDENT INTIMACY WITH THE PRETTY GODCHILD
IT'S A BETTER DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM THAN SOME RECENTLY GIVEN BUT SURELY THE GET UP WOULD BE TOO BIG A BUSINESS NOT A SCRAP CRIED BLOUNT QUITE CARRIED AWAY
I WON'T HAVE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT CRIED THE GIRL WHO WAS IN A CURIOUS GLOW YOU'VE ONLY TALKED LIKE THAT SINCE YOU BECAME A HORRID WHAT'S HIS NAME YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
HAD COME OUT HIMSELF TO INVITE HIS EMINENT GUEST INSIDE HE WAS A TALL SUNBURNT AND VERY SILENT MAN WHO WORE A RED SMOKING CAP LIKE A FEZ MAKING HIM LOOK LIKE ONE OF THE ENGLISH SIRDARS
SHE HAD WORN AT A FANCY DRESS PARTY AS THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS INDEED HER UNCLE JAMES BLOUNT WAS GETTING ALMOST OUT OF HAND IN HIS EXCITEMENT HE WAS LIKE A SCHOOLBOY
WITH HIM ALSO WAS THE MORE INSIGNIFICANT FIGURE OF THE PRIEST FROM THE NEIGHBOURING ROMAN CHURCH FOR THE COLONEL'S LATE WIFE HAD BEEN A CATHOLIC AND THE CHILDREN AS IS COMMON IN SUCH CASES HAD BEEN TRAINED TO FOLLOW HER
HALF WAY BETWEEN THE FRONT DOOR AND THE STAIRCASE TO MARK THE LINE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS HOW EVEN SUCH A BANQUET OF BOSH WAS GOT READY IN THE TIME REMAINED A RIDDLE
HAVEN'T KILLED A POLICEMAN LATELY BLOUNT FROWNED THOUGHTFULLY A SPACE AND THEN SMOTE HIS THIGH YES WE CAN HE CRIED I'VE GOT FLORIAN'S ADDRESS HERE
PUT IN THE PRIEST IN A LOW VOICE TO OWN YOUR OWN SOOT CROOK LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN EYE OF INTEREST AND EVEN RESPECT DOES ONE WANT TO OWN SOOT HE ASKED ONE MIGHT
IT WAS JUST AS IF A CRYSTAL FOUNTAIN HAD SPURTED IN THEIR EYES IN A NEST OF ORANGE VELVET LAY LIKE THREE EGGS THREE WHITE AND VIVID DIAMONDS THAT SEEMED TO SET THE VERY AIR ON FIRE ALL ROUND THEM
HAD BEEN BADLY USED MISSUS LYNDE TOLD THEM TO KEEP ON AND SHOW THE PYES THAT THERE REALLY WERE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD DO THINGS WITHOUT MAKING A MUDDLE OF THEM MISTER MAJOR SPENCER SENT THEM WORD THAT HE WOULD CLEAN OUT ALL THE STUMPS ALONG THE ROAD FRONT OF HIS FARM AND SEED IT DOWN WITH GRASS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
THE TROUBLE IS I'VE GOT THINGS THE MATTER WITH MY CONSCIENCE SOBBED ANNE OH THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A JONAH DAY MARILLA I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF I LOST MY TEMPER AND WHIPPED ANTHONY PYE I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID MARILLA WITH DECISION
HE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN'T HELP IT I WANT EVERYBODY TO LOVE ME AND IT HURTS ME SO WHEN ANYBODY DOESN'T AND ANTHONY NEVER WILL NOW OH I JUST MADE AN IDIOT OF MYSELF TODAY MARILLA I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
EVERYBODY REALIZED THAT EVEN THE EXPLOSION HAD NOT CLEARED THE TEACHER'S MENTAL ATMOSPHERE NOBODY EXCEPT ANTHONY PYE DARED WHISPER A WORD NED CLAY ACCIDENTALLY SQUEAKED HIS PENCIL WHILE WORKING A SUM CAUGHT ANNE'S EYE AND WISHED THE FLOOR WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW HIM UP
THE OLDEST TWIN CAME SAILING OVER THE SEA IN AN ENCHANTED BOAT AND I GOT IN HER THE BOAT WAS ALL PEARLY AND RAINBOWY LIKE THE INSIDE OF THE MUSSEL SHELLS AND HER SAIL WAS LIKE MOONSHINE WELL WE SAILED RIGHT ACROSS TO THE SUNSET
ANNE CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT AND JUMPED TO A FATAL CONCLUSION ABOUT THAT PARCEL OLD MISSUS HIRAM SLOANE HAD LATELY TAKEN TO MAKING AND SELLING NUT CAKES BY WAY OF ADDING TO HER SCANTY INCOME THE CAKES WERE SPECIALLY TEMPTING TO SMALL BOYS
EXCUSE ME YOU MUSTN'T MIND IT IT'S JUST A HABIT I'VE GOT YOU'D THINK HE WAS CRAZY WOULDN'T YOU AND AS FOR MISSUS LYNDE BEING A BUSYBODY PERHAPS SHE IS BUT DID YOU TELL HER SHE HAD A VERY KIND HEART AND ALWAYS HELPED THE POOR
WHEN WE GOT UP I STEPPED ON HER DRESS AND ALL THE GATHERS TORE OUT OF THE SKIRT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I GOT UP I HIT THE PITCHER AGAINST THE BASIN AND CRACKED THEM BOTH AND I UPSET A CUP OF TEA ON THE TABLECLOTH AT BREAKFAST
I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A TALKER TILL I CAME TO AVONLEA AND THEN I HAD TO BEGIN IN SELF DEFENSE OR MISSUS LYNDE WOULD HAVE SAID I WAS DUMB AND STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION TO HAVE ME TAUGHT SIGN LANGUAGE
THE HALL WAS SO CLOSELY SURROUNDED BY FIR WOODS THAT IT WAS INVISIBLE UNLESS YOU WERE NEAR IT MISTER JOSHUA PYE PAINTED AWAY IN THE SOLITUDE AND INDEPENDENCE THAT WERE SO DEAR TO HIS UNSOCIABLE HEART FRIDAY AFTERNOON HE FINISHED HIS JOB AND WENT HOME TO CARMODY
HER VOICE WAS QUITE LOW BUT IT MADE A SHIVER GO UP AND DOWN PAUL IRVING'S SPINE JOE SLOANE CAUGHT HER EYE FELT RESPONSIBLE FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FEET BUT STUTTERED OUT WILDLY
THAT OLD NUISANCE OF A RACHEL LYNDE WAS HERE AGAIN TODAY PESTERING ME FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TOWARDS BUYING A CARPET FOR THE VESTRY ROOM SAID MISTER HARRISON WRATHFULLY I DETEST THAT WOMAN MORE THAN ANYBODY I KNOW SHE CAN PUT A WHOLE SERMON
A MOONGLADE IS THE TRACK THE FULL MOON MAKES ON THE WATER WHEN IT IS RISING FROM THE SEA YOU KNOW TEACHER WELL THE YOUNGEST TWIN SAILOR SAILED ALONG THE MOONGLADE TILL HE CAME RIGHT UP TO THE MOON
FOLKS ARE EVERLASTING BEGGING FOR MONEY HERE IT SEEMS TO ME HOW'S YOUR PROJECT OF PAINTING THE HALL COMING ON SPLENDIDLY WE HAD A MEETING OF THE A V I S LAST FRIDAY NIGHT AND FOUND THAT WE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY SUBSCRIBED TO PAINT THE HALL AND SHINGLE THE ROOF TOO
HE PEERED ACROSS HIS BOOK AT ANNE HIS BLACK EYES SPARKLING WITH CURIOSITY AND MOCKERY ANNE TWITCHED OPEN THE DRAWER OF HER DESK IN SEARCH OF CHALK AND UNDER HER VERY HAND A LIVELY MOUSE SPRANG OUT OF THE DRAWER SCAMPERED OVER THE DESK AND LEAPED TO THE FLOOR
IT WAS BECAUSE JIMMY CALLED HIM SAINT CLAIR THAT SAINT CLAIR POUNDED HIM ON THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL I HEARD OF THE POUNDING BUT NOT OFFICIALLY SO I DON'T THINK I'LL TAKE ANY NOTICE OF IT YESTERDAY I WAS TRYING TO TEACH LOTTIE WRIGHT TO DO ADDITION I SAID
OR SOME INTERESTING THING OR PERSON THEY HAD SEEN THEY WERE TO WRITE THE LETTERS ON REAL NOTE PAPER SEAL THEM IN AN ENVELOPE AND ADDRESS THEM TO ME ALL WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER PEOPLE LAST FRIDAY MORNING I FOUND A PILE OF LETTERS ON MY DESK AND THAT EVENING I REALIZED AFRESH
HE LETS IT SLEEP ON HIS ROCKING CHARE AND MY AUNT SAYS HE THINKS MORE OF IT THAN HE DOES OF HIS CHILDREN THAT IS NOT RIGHT WE OUGHT TO BE KIND TO CATS AND GIVE THEM NEW MILK BUT WE OUGHT NOT BE BETTER TO THEM THAN TO OUR CHILDREN
AND WHEN MISTER ROGER PYE SENT WORD TO THE IMPROVERS BY HIS SON JOHN ANDREW THAT HE WAS GOING TO TOWN AND WOULD GET THEIR PAINT FOR THEM
THE NEWS FLEW LIKE WILDFIRE GILBERT BLYTHE PORING OVER A TEXT BOOK AT HOME HEARD IT FROM HIS FATHER'S HIRED BOY AT SUNSET AND RUSHED BREATHLESSLY TO GREEN GABLES JOINED ON THE WAY BY FRED WRIGHT
ELIZA BELL HAD SET FIRE TO HER AUNT'S CARDED ROLLS ASKED IF SHE MEANT TO DO IT SHE SAID NOT ALTOGETHER
ANNE RECOVERING HERSELF SPRANG TO OPEN DOORS AND WINDOWS AND LET OUT THE GAS AND SMOKE WHICH FILLED THE ROOM THEN SHE HELPED THE GIRLS CARRY THE UNCONSCIOUS PRILLIE INTO THE PORCH
I DIDN'T LIKE MISSUS LYNDE AT FIRST EITHER BUT AS SOON AS I CAME TO UNDERSTAND HER I LEARNED TO MISSUS LYNDE MAY BE AN ACQUIRED TASTE WITH SOME FOLKS
THE SHADE THEY USE FOR PAINTING CARTS AND WHEELBARROWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT IS THE MOST HIDEOUS COLOR FOR A BUILDING ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH A RED ROOF THAT SHE EVER SAW OR IMAGINED YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER WHEN I HEARD IT
IT HAD SNOWED SOFTLY AND THICKLY ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF DARKNESS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS GLITTERING IN THE FROSTY SUNSHINE LOOKED LIKE A MANTLE OF CHARITY CAST OVER ALL THE MISTAKES AND HUMILIATIONS OF THE PAST EVERY MORN IS A FRESH BEGINNING
ANNE HAD WARNED THEM THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ANY MORE CAKES TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND YET HERE WAS SAINT CLAIR DONNELL COOLLY PASSING A PARCEL OF THEM WRAPPED UP IN THE BLUE AND WHITE STRIPED PAPER MISSUS HIRAM USED UNDER HER VERY EYES
MOST PEOPLE GAVE VERY LIBERALLY MISTER HARRISON ANNE WAS A SWEET SOULED LASS BUT SHE COULD INSTILL SOME VENOM INTO INNOCENT ITALICS WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED WHAT COLOR ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE IT WE HAVE DECIDED ON A VERY PRETTY GREEN
JUST COME DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE YOUR SUPPER YOU'LL SEE IF A GOOD CUP OF TEA AND THOSE PLUM PUFFS I MADE TODAY WON'T HEARTEN YOU UP PLUM PUFFS WON'T MINISTER TO A MIND DISEASED SAID ANNE DISCONSOLATELY
WHEN ANNE'S SOBS GREW QUIETER SHE SAID VERY GENTLY FOR HER YOU TAKE THINGS TOO MUCH TO HEART ANNE WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES BUT PEOPLE FORGET THEM AND JONAH DAYS COME TO EVERYBODY AS FOR ANTHONY PYE WHY NEED YOU CARE IF HE DOES DISLIKE YOU
AND THEN WE MARRIED SAID HE DON'T YOU REMEMBER AND THEN WE HAD OUR FIRST LITTLE BOY AND THEN MARY AND NICHOLAS AND PETER AND CHRISTIAN
I STOOD OUTSIDE THE CHAMBER DOOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND HARDLY VENTURED NEAR THE BED THEN ALL WAS COMPOSED HOWEVER CATHERINE'S DESPAIR WAS AS SILENT AS HER FATHER'S JOY SHE SUPPORTED HIM CALMLY IN APPEARANCE
IF I HAD BUT SOMETHING NEW TO TELL SAID THE OLD MAN BUT HOW DID THE CHILD GET HIS FEET WET THAT IS THE VERY THING THAT NOBODY CAN MAKE OUT SAID HIS MOTHER
THE BOY SAW IT ALL AND YET THEY WERE ONLY GOING ROUND THE GRASS PLOT THEN THEY PLAYED IN A SIDE AVENUE AND MARKED OUT A LITTLE GARDEN ON THE EARTH AND THEY TOOK ELDER BLOSSOMS FROM THEIR HAIR PLANTED THEM AND THEY GREW JUST LIKE THOSE THE OLD PEOPLE PLANTED WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN AS RELATED BEFORE
MY MOTHER SAYS THAT ALL YOU LOOK AT CAN BE TURNED INTO A FAIRY TALE AND THAT YOU CAN FIND A STORY IN EVERYTHING YES BUT SUCH TALES AND STORIES ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING THE RIGHT SORT COME OF THEMSELVES THEY TAP AT MY FOREHEAD AND SAY HERE WE ARE
FOR THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT OLD TIMES YES CAN'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE VERY LITTLE SAID THE OLD SEAMAN AND RAN AND PLAYED ABOUT IT WAS THE VERY SAME COURT YARD WHERE WE NOW ARE AND WE STUCK SLIPS IN THE GROUND AND MADE A GARDEN
SUCKING A STICK OF SUGAR CANDY AND PURSUING MY MOVEMENTS WITH APATHETIC EYES WHERE IS MISS CATHERINE I DEMANDED STERNLY SUPPOSING I COULD FRIGHTEN HIM INTO GIVING INTELLIGENCE BY CATCHING HIM THUS ALONE HE SUCKED ON LIKE AN INNOCENT IS SHE GONE I SAID
HAVING RECEIVED HIS ORDERS I DESPATCHED A MAN TO FETCH THE ATTORNEY AND FOUR MORE PROVIDED WITH SERVICEABLE WEAPONS TO DEMAND MY YOUNG LADY OF HER JAILOR BOTH PARTIES WERE DELAYED VERY LATE THE SINGLE SERVANT RETURNED FIRST HE SAID MISTER GREEN THE LAWYER
AND I WENT ON INTENDING TO SEND SOMEBODY ELSE TO OPEN IT BUT THE KNOCK WAS REPEATED NOT LOUD AND STILL IMPORTUNATELY I PUT THE JUG ON THE BANISTER AND HASTENED TO ADMIT HIM MYSELF THE HARVEST MOON SHONE CLEAR OUTSIDE
YOU WHO HAVE FELT WHAT IT IS TO BE SO NEGLECTED YOU COULD PITY YOUR OWN SUFFERINGS AND SHE PITIED THEM TOO BUT YOU WON'T PITY HERS I SHED TEARS MASTER HEATHCLIFF YOU SEE AN ELDERLY WOMAN
YOU ARRIVED AS SOON AS YOUR LETTER AND YOU WERE SO HANDSOME THAT YOU STILL ARE AND HAD A LONG YELLOW SILK HANDKERCHIEF ROUND YOUR NECK AND A BRAN NEW HAT ON OH YOU WERE SO DASHING GOOD HEAVENS WHAT WEATHER IT WAS AND WHAT A STATE THE STREET WAS IN
SHE WANTED TO RUN BREATHLESS AS SHE WAS UP STAIRS TO MISTER LINTON'S ROOM BUT I COMPELLED HER TO SIT DOWN ON A CHAIR AND MADE HER DRINK AND WASHED HER PALE FACE CHAFING IT INTO A FAINT COLOUR WITH MY APRON THEN I SAID I MUST GO FIRST AND TELL OF HER ARRIVAL
AND THE ELDERBUSH SENT FORTH A STRONG ODOUR IN THE SUN THAT WAS JUST ABOUT TO SET AND SHONE RIGHT IN THE OLD PEOPLE'S FACES THEY BOTH LOOKED SO ROSY CHEEKED AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE GRANDCHILDREN DANCED AROUND THEM
AND YOU CAN GET THE KEY IF YOU CHOOSE I SAID YES WHEN I AM UP STAIRS HE ANSWERED BUT I CAN'T WALK UP STAIRS NOW IN WHAT APARTMENT IS IT I ASKED OH HE CRIED I SHAN'T TELL YOU WHERE IT IS IT IS OUR SECRET
AND HE FIXED ON HER FEATURES HIS RAISED EYES THAT SEEMED DILATING WITH ECSTASY HE DIED BLISSFULLY MISTER LOCKWOOD HE DIED SO KISSING HER CHEEK HE MURMURED AM GOING TO HER AND YOU DARLING CHILD SHALL COME TO US AND NEVER STIRRED OR SPOKE AGAIN
NEAR THE GREEN LAWN PAPA'S WALKING STICK WAS TIED AND FOR THE LITTLE ONES IT SEEMED TO BE ENDOWED WITH LIFE
AND UNDER IT SAT OF AN AFTERNOON IN THE MOST SPLENDID SUNSHINE TWO OLD PEOPLE AN OLD OLD SEAMAN AND HIS OLD OLD WIFE THEY HAD GREAT GRAND CHILDREN AND WERE SOON TO CELEBRATE THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR MARRIAGE
SHE WEPT TO MISS ONE EVENING BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED AND YOU FELT THEN THAT SHE WAS A HUNDRED TIMES TOO GOOD TO YOU AND NOW YOU BELIEVE THE LIES YOUR FATHER TELLS THOUGH YOU KNOW HE DETESTS YOU BOTH AND YOU JOIN HIM AGAINST HER THAT'S FINE GRATITUDE IS IT NOT
AND WERE BELOVED BY EVERYBODY AND THEIR CHILDREN ALSO HAVE CHILDREN SAID THE OLD SAILOR YES THOSE ARE OUR GRAND CHILDREN FULL OF STRENGTH AND VIGOR IT WAS METHINKS ABOUT THIS SEASON THAT WE HAD OUR WEDDING YES
AND SUDDENLY THE ATMOSPHERE GREW AS BLUE AGAIN AS BEFORE THE FOREST GREW RED AND GREEN AND YELLOW COLORED THE DOGS CAME LEAPING ALONG
I REMEMBER IT WELL SAID THE OLD WOMAN I REMEMBER IT QUITE WELL WE WATERED THE SLIPS AND ONE OF THEM WAS AN ELDERBUSH IT TOOK ROOT
AND THE MORE HE LOOKED AT IT THE FRESHER IT BECAME
I CONSIDERED IT BEST TO DEPART WITHOUT SEEING MISTER HEATHCLIFF AND BRING A RESCUE FOR MY YOUNG LADY FROM THE GRANGE
SHE REFUSED AND HE HE STRUCK HER DOWN AND WRENCHED IT OFF THE CHAIN AND CRUSHED IT WITH HIS FOOT AND WERE YOU PLEASED TO SEE HER STRUCK I ASKED HAVING MY DESIGNS IN ENCOURAGING HIS TALK I WINKED HE ANSWERED
SHE GOT EASILY OUT OF ITS LATTICE AND ON TO THE GROUND BY MEANS OF THE FIR TREE CLOSE BY
JUST UP TO THE MIDDLE OF MY BOOT SAID THE CHILD BUT THEN I MUST GO INTO THE DEEP HOLE AH AH THAT'S WHERE THE WET FEET CAME FROM SAID THE OLD MAN I OUGHT NOW TO TELL YOU A STORY BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE YOU CAN MAKE ONE IN A MOMENT SAID THE LITTLE BOY
DIRECT ME TO HER ROOM IMMEDIATELY OR I'LL MAKE YOU SING OUT SHARPLY PAPA WOULD MAKE YOU SING OUT IF YOU ATTEMPTED TO GET THERE HE ANSWERED HE SAYS I'M NOT TO BE SOFT WITH CATHERINE SHE'S MY WIFE
AND ONE FALLING STAR AFTER THE OTHER WAS SEEN IN THE SKY THE CHRISTMAS TREE WAS LIGHTED IN THE ROOM PRESENTS WERE THERE AND GOOD HUMOR REIGNED IN THE COUNTRY THE VIOLIN SOUNDED IN THE ROOM OF THE PEASANT THE NEWLY BAKED CAKES WERE ATTACKED EVEN THE POOREST CHILD SAID
SHE TOLD ME THAT HER ANGUISH HAD AT LAST SPURRED LINTON TO INCUR THE RISK OF LIBERATING HER SHE HEARD THE MEN I SENT DISPUTING AT THE DOOR AND SHE GATHERED THE SENSE OF HEATHCLIFF'S ANSWER IT DROVE HER DESPERATE
WHILE I AM ABLE TO MIX WITH THE POORER OF THE BUSINESS MEN OF THE CITY ON TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE EQUALITY IN POINT OF LEISURE I ENJOY MORE IN THE FOUR CORNERS OF A SINGLE YEAR THAN A BUSINESS MAN KNOWS IN HIS WHOLE LIFE I THUS HAVE WHAT THE BUSINESS MAN CAN NEVER ENJOY
A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
MY PARENTS MIGRATED TO CANADA IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM MY FATHER TOOK UP A FARM NEAR LAKE SIMCOE IN ONTARIO THIS WAS DURING THE HARD TIMES OF CANADIAN FARMING
NOR TO CONSTRUCT EVEN THE SMALLEST SECTION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY THIS HOWEVER IS A FORM OF NATIONAL INGRATITUDE TO WHICH ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED IN THIS DOMINION APART FROM MY COLLEGE WORK I HAVE WRITTEN TWO BOOKS ONE CALLED LITERARY LAPSES
THAT IS INDUCED BY HONEST MANUAL TOIL I WAS EDUCATED AT UPPER CANADA COLLEGE TORONTO OF WHICH I WAS HEAD BOY IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FROM THERE I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHERE I GRADUATED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
IN OTHER WORDS I WAS WHAT IS CALLED A DISTINGUISHED GRADUATE AND AS SUCH I TOOK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AS THE ONLY TRADE I COULD FIND THAT NEED NEITHER EXPERIENCE NOR INTELLECT I SPENT MY TIME FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE TO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON THE STAFF OF UPPER CANADA COLLEGE
AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
HE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOW
JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
THE FAULT LIES RATHER WITH AN ART THAT IS DEFICIENT THAN IN AN AFFECTION THAT IS WANTING
AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
MULLINS AND BAGSHAW AND JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH AND THE REST ARE IT IS TRUE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE BUT I HAVE KNOWN THEM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF FORMS WITH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF TALL AND SHORT DARK AND FAIR THAT INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW THEM
BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
A LAND OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE WHERE LITTLE TOWNS SPREAD THEIR SQUARE STREETS AND THEIR TRIM MAPLE TREES BESIDE PLACID LAKES ALMOST WITHIN ECHO OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST IS LARGE ENOUGH
IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
IF SHE WERE BEING LED TO THE STAKE AND HE RAN AND WAKENED UP A VERY TIRED DOCTOR JUST AS HE HAD GOT TO SLEEP OH DOCTOR MY SON HAS SWALLOWED A MOUSE HE CRIED WHAT SHALL I DO
WHEN THE PALE CHEEK AND QUIVERING LIP OF ISABELLA REMOVED HER RESENTMENT IN A MOMENT IT IS TRUE MY CONJECTURE IS TRUE SPEAK TO ME MISS WHARTON I CONJURE YOU IN MERCY TO MY FEELINGS TO TELL ME DO YOU LOVE DUNWOODIE
THERE WAS A PLAINTIVE EARNESTNESS IN THE VOICE OF MISS SINGLETON THAT DISARMED FRANCES OF ALL RESENTMENT AND THE ONLY ANSWER SHE COULD MAKE WAS TO HIDE HER BURNING FACE BETWEEN HER HANDS AS SHE SANK BACK IN A CHAIR TO CONCEAL HER CONFUSION
AND SHE STOOD ENDEAVORING TO STIFLE THE SOUNDS OF HER OWN GENTLE BREATHING UNTIL THE FOLLOWING SONG WAS CONCLUDED
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A HORRIBLE FEAR WHICH FLASHED INTO HER MIND THAT POSSIBLY SAWDUST PUDDINGS WERE NOT HEALTHY FOR PEOPLE TO EAT
I BELIEVE YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE TO HAVE A STORY TO TELL UNCLE ROGER HOBBLED OFF TO THE BARN STILL HOLDING ON TO HIS STOMACH DO YOU THINK HE REALLY FEELS SICK ASKED THE STORY GIRL ANXIOUSLY NO I DON'T SAID FELICITY
I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT THESE SHARP PAINS I'VE BEEN FEELING EVER SINCE DINNER MEANT I KNOW NOW I MUST HAVE SWALLOWED A NEEDLE SEVERAL NEEDLES PERHAPS I'M DONE FOR
AND LEFT THE SECONDARY PREPARATION OF THE REGULAR MEALS TO CECILY AND THE STORY GIRL IT WAS AGREED THAT THE LATTER WAS TO MAKE A CORNMEAL PUDDING FOR DINNER IN SPITE OF HER DISASTER WITH THE BREAD
WHILE THIS EXTRAORDINARY SCENE WAS ACTING IN THE ROOM OF MISS SINGLETON MATTERS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE WERE AGITATED IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE DISPOSITION OF THE FRAGMENTS OF SUCH A
DIRECTION IT WAS HER DUTY TO UNDO IT IF POSSIBLE AT ANY COST OF RIDICULE TO HERSELF OH FELICITY SHE SAID HER VOICE EXPRESSING A VERY ANGUISH OF HUMILIATION I
AND SAW HIM GAZING AT HER FINE FACE WITH AN ADMIRATION THAT WAS QUITE AS MANIFEST AND MUCH MORE SOOTHING THAN ANY WORDS COULD MAKE IT THEIR TETE A TETE WAS UNINTERRUPTED FOR AN HOUR AND ALTHOUGH NOTHING THAT WOULD BE CALLED DECIDED BY AN EXPERIENCED MATRON
AND FRANCES MOVED TOWARDS IT WITH THE BENEVOLENT INTENTION OF ASCERTAINING THE SITUATION OF HER GUEST WHEN THE SURPRISED GIRL SAW HER WHOM SHE HAD THOUGHT TO BE SLEEPING NOT ONLY AWAKE BUT EMPLOYED IN A MANNER
THAT BANISHED ALL PROBABILITY OF PRESENT REPOSE THE BLACK TRESSES THAT DURING THE DINNER HAD BEEN DRAWN IN CLOSE FOLDS OVER THE CROWN OF THE HEAD WERE NOW LOOSENED AND FELL IN PROFUSION OVER HER SHOULDERS AND BOSOM IMPARTING A SLIGHT DEGREE OF WILDNESS TO HER COUNTENANCE
FELICITY WAS CUMBERED WITH MANY CARES THE NEXT MORNING FOR ONE THING THE WHOLE HOUSE MUST BE PUT IN APPLE PIE ORDER AND FOR ANOTHER AN ELABORATE SUPPER MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN OF THE TRAVELLERS THAT NIGHT FELICITY DEVOTED HER WHOLE ATTENTION TO THIS
A SEASON WHOSE TEMPERATURE VARIES FROM THE HEATS OF SUMMER TO THE COLD OF WINTER FRANCES HAD STOOD AT THE WINDOW OF HER OWN APARTMENT WATCHING THE SLOW PROGRESS OF THE FUNERAL PROCESSION WITH A MELANCHOLY THAT WAS TOO DEEP TO BE EXCITED BY THE SPECTACLE
FELICITY HAVING USED UP ALL THE AVAILABLE COOKING MATERIALS IN THE HOUSE HAD TO STOP PERFORCE AND SHE NOW DETERMINED TO STUFF TWO NEW PINCUSHIONS SHE HAD BEEN MAKING FOR HER ROOM
DO YOU KNOW DUNWOODIE HAVE YOU SEEN HIM OFTEN ONCE MORE FRANCES VENTURED TO LOOK HER GUEST IN THE FACE AND AGAIN SHE MET THE PIERCING EYES BENT ON HER AS IF TO SEARCH HER INMOST HEART SPEAK MISS WHARTON IS MAJOR DUNWOODIE KNOWN TO YOU
THE STORY GIRL HAD BEEN TAKING COOKING LESSONS FROM FELICITY ALL THE WEEK AND GETTING ON TOLERABLY WELL ALTHOUGH MINDFUL OF HER FORMER MISTAKE SHE NEVER VENTURED ON ANYTHING WITHOUT FELICITY'S APPROVAL BUT FELICITY HAD NO TIME TO OVERSEE HER THIS MORNING
TWAS UNFORTUNATE INDEED IN EVERY RESPECT THAT YOU MET WITH THE ACCIDENT OR DOUBTLESS THE ROYAL ARMS WOULD HAVE TRIUMPHED IN THEIR USUAL MANNER AND YET THE PLEASURE OF SUCH SOCIETY AS THIS ACCIDENT HAS INTRODUCED ME TO
FELICITY AND CECILY STARED BLANKLY AT THE STORY GIRL WE BOYS BEGAN TO LAUGH BUT WERE CHECKED MIDWAY BY UNCLE ROGER HE WAS ROCKING HIMSELF BACK AND FORTH WITH HIS HAND PRESSED AGAINST HIS STOMACH OH HE GROANED
THAT COLONEL WELLMERE WAS LEFT TO THE HOSPITALITY OF SARAH WHARTON ALL THE ORDINARY TOPICS OF CONVERSATION WERE EXHAUSTED WHEN THE COLONEL WITH A LITTLE OF THE UNEASINESS THAT IS IN SOME DEGREE INSEPARABLE FROM CONSCIOUS ERROR
AND BARE IS THE OAK ON THE HILL SLOWLY THE VAPORS EXHALE FROM THE FOUNTAIN AND BRIGHT GLEAMS THE ICE BORDERED RILL ALL NATURE IS SEEKING ITS ANNUAL REST BUT THE SLUMBERS OF PEACE HAVE DESERTED MY BREAST
NOTWITHSTANDING SEVERAL OF THE SMALL GAME HAD NESTLED IN THE POCKET OF CAPTAIN LAWTON'S MAN AND EVEN THE ASSISTANT OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES HAD CALCULATED THE UNCERTAINTY OF HIS REMAINING LONG IN SUCH GOOD QUARTERS
THEY FELL IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS AND LAID THEIR BURNING CHEEKS TOGETHER THE EMBRACE WAS LONG WAS ARDENT AND SINCERE BUT NEITHER SPOKE AND ON SEPARATING FRANCES RETIRED TO HER OWN ROOM WITHOUT FURTHER EXPLANATION
AS THE STORY GIRL PROUDLY INFORMED US WHEN WE CAME TO THE DINNER TABLE ALL ON HER OWN HOOK SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF IT AND CERTAINLY AS FAR AS APPEARANCE WENT IT JUSTIFIED HER TRIUMPH THE SLICES WERE SMOOTH AND GOLDEN
HE TORMENTED HER FOR THE REST OF THE SUMMER NEVER A BREAKFAST DID HE SIT DOWN TO WITHOUT GRAVELY INQUIRING IF THEY WERE SURE THERE WAS NO SAWDUST IN THE PORRIDGE
AND WHICH FOLLOWED EACH OTHER OVER HER CHEEK AT SUCH INTERVALS AS SEEMED TO PRONOUNCE THE GRIEF TOO HEAVY TO ADMIT OF
AND SHE ROSE AND MOVED TO A WINDOW OF HER APARTMENT
THE STORY GIRL'S FACE WORE A QUITE INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION COMPOUND OF HORROR AND SHAME SHE NEED NOT HAVE CONFESSED IF SHE HAD BUT HELD HER TONGUE THE MYSTERY OF THE SAWDUST'S DISAPPEARANCE MIGHT HAVE FOREVER REMAINED A MYSTERY SHE WOULD HAVE HELD HER TONGUE
AND LET THOSE STUCK UP TORONTO BOYS GRIN LIKE CHESSY CATS BUT WHEN FELICITY LAUGHED AT HIM THE IRON ENTERED INTO PETER'S SOUL IF THE STORY GIRL LAUGHED AT PETER THE MILLS OF THE GODS GROUND OUT HIS REVENGE FOR HIM IN MID AFTERNOON
WHEN I WAS AT POONA IN SEVENTY SIX MY DEAR COLONEL PURRED REGINALD FANCY ADMITTING SUCH A THING SUCH A GIVE AWAY FOR ONE'S AGE I WOULDN'T ADMIT BEING ON THIS PLANET IN SEVENTY SIX
BUT STILL IT SHOWED IMAGINATION HIS WIFE WAS REALLY TO BE PITIED BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN THE ONLY PERSON IN THE HOUSE WHO UNDERSTOOD HOW TO MANAGE THE COOK'S TEMPER AND NOW SHE HAS TO PUT D V ON HER DINNER INVITATIONS STILL
YOUR COUSIN IS DISCUSSING ZAZA WITH THE ARCHDEACON'S WIFE AT LEAST HE IS DISCUSSING SHE IS ORDERING HER CARRIAGE SHE SPOKE IN THE DRY STACCATO TONE OF ONE WHO REPEATS A FRENCH EXERCISE AND I KNEW
MISSUS RAMPAGE OCCUPIES A PROMINENT PLACE IN LOCAL TEMPERANCE MOVEMENTS AS SOON AS I HAD BROKEN UP THIS UNPROMISING TETE A TETE AND SETTLED REGINALD WHERE HE COULD WATCH THE CROQUET PLAYERS LOSING THEIR TEMPERS
IS THERE SUCH A WORD AS LONG AS ONE IS NICE LOOKING AND SUFFICIENTLY UNUSUAL TO COUNTERBALANCE SOME OF THE OTHERS AND THERE ARE OTHERS THE GIRL FOR INSTANCE WHO READS MEREDITH
I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN ME LONG ENOUGH FOR THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU LONGER THAN YOUR GOD PARENTS HAD WHEN THEY TOOK THE LIBERTY OF CALLING YOU THAT NAME SCANDAL IS MERELY THE COMPASSIONATE ALLOWANCE WHICH THE GAY MAKE TO THE HUMDRUM
AND WE MUST GET OUR IDEAS FROM SOMEWHERE I SUPPOSE EVEN THE HOOLIGAN WAS PROBABLY INVENTED IN CHINA CENTURIES BEFORE WE THOUGHT OF HIM ENGLAND MUST WAKE UP AS THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE SAID THE OTHER DAY WASN'T IT
THE SINGING HAD DIED DOWN LONG BEFORE THE MAIN STREET WAS REACHED BUT THE MISERABLE WAILING OF PIPES BROUGHT THE INHABITANTS TO THEIR DOORS REGINALD SAID HE HAD SEEN SOMETHING LIKE IT IN PICTURES
AND NOW IF YOU CAN TEAR YOURSELF AWAY FROM THE SALTED ALMONDS WE'LL GO AND HAVE COFFEE UNDER THE PALMS THAT ARE SO NECESSARY FOR OUR DISCOMFORT
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN DISILLUSIONMENTS IN THE LIVES OF THE MEDIAEVAL SAINTS BUT THEY WOULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN BETTER PLEASED IF THEY COULD HAVE FORESEEN THAT THEIR NAMES WOULD BE ASSOCIATED NOWADAYS CHIEFLY
SHE WAS SUFFICIENTLY OLD FASHIONED TO DISLIKE IRREVERENCE TOWARDS DIVIDENDS REGINALD HAD LEFT THE SELECTION OF A FEEDING GROUND TO HER WOMANLY INTUITION BUT HE CHOSE THE WINE HIMSELF
THERE ARE PEOPLE ONE KNOWS QUITE NICE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE IN ENGLAND WHO ARE SO DIFFERENT WHEN THEY ARE ANYWHERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL THE PEOPLE WITH WHAT I CALL
ISN'T THERE A BISHOP OR SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES WE SHALL MEET ALL THE ANIMALS WE HAVE KNOWN ON EARTH IN ANOTHER WORLD HOW FRIGHTFULLY EMBARRASSING TO MEET A WHOLE SHOAL OF WHITEBAIT YOU HAD LAST KNOWN AT PRINCE'S
A SCANDAL MY DEAR REGINALD IS AS MUCH TO BE AVOIDED AT MONACO OR ANY OF THOSE PLACES AS AT EXETER LET US SAY SCANDAL MY DEAR IRENE I MAY CALL YOU IRENE MAYN'T I
THAT'S BETTER THAN A DOMESTIC SCANDAL A WOMAN WHO LEAVES HER COOK NEVER WHOLLY RECOVERS HER POSITION IN SOCIETY I SUPPOSE THE SAME THING HOLDS GOOD WITH THE HOSTS THEY SELDOM HAVE MORE THAN A SUPERFICIAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH THEIR GUESTS
REGINALD'S CHOIR TREAT NEVER WROTE REGINALD TO HIS MOST DARLING FRIEND BE A PIONEER IT'S THE EARLY CHRISTIAN THAT GETS THE FATTEST LION REGINALD IN HIS WAY
I PERSUADED REGINALD TO GO TO THE MC KILLOPS GARDEN PARTY AGAINST HIS WILL WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES OCCASIONALLY THEY KNOW YOU'RE HERE AND THEY'LL THINK IT SO FUNNY IF YOU DON'T GO AND I WANT PARTICULARLY TO BE IN WITH MISSUS MC KILLOP JUST NOW
THAT AS FAR AS MILLIE MC KILLOP WAS CONCERNED WUMPLES WAS DEVOTED TO A LIFELONG CELIBACY IF YOU DON'T MIND I SAID HURRIEDLY I THINK WE'D LIKE OUR CARRIAGE ORDERED TOO AND I MADE A FORCED MARCH IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CROQUET GROUND
FORETHOUGHT HAD PROVIDED THE OCCASION WITH A SUPPLY OF TIN WHISTLES BUT THE INTRODUCTION OF A HE GOAT FROM A NEIGHBOURING ORCHARD WAS A BRILLIANT AFTERTHOUGHT PROPERLY REGINALD EXPLAINED
ARE DIFFERENT AND LIKE EVERY WOMAN WHO HAS EVER PREACHED REPENTANCE TO UNREGENERATE YOUTH SHE DWELT ON THE SIN OF AN EMPTY LIFE WHICH ALWAYS SEEMS SO MUCH MORE SCANDALOUS IN THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE RISE EARLY
AMABEL COMMENCED OPERATIONS BY ASKING HER UNSUSPECTING PUPIL TO TEA IN THE VICARAGE GARDEN SHE BELIEVED IN THE HEALTHY INFLUENCE OF NATURAL SURROUNDINGS NEVER HAVING BEEN IN SICILY WHERE THINGS
TO SEE IF A NEW STRAWBERRY HAS HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT REGINALD RECALLED THE LILIES OF THE FIELD WHICH SIMPLY SAT AND LOOKED BEAUTIFUL AND DEFIED COMPETITION BUT THAT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE FOR US TO FOLLOW
OF THEIR LIMITATIONS THAT IS WHY ONE SHOULD BE SO PATIENT WITH THEM BUT ONE NEVER IS AFTER ALL SAID THE DUCHESS THE DISILLUSIONS OF LIFE MAY DEPEND ON OUR WAY OF ASSESSING IT
OPIUM HABIT ONCE YOU START IT YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP IT UP THEIR ELDEST SON WAS SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THEM THEY WANTED HIM TO BE A LINGUIST AND SPENT NO END OF MONEY ON HAVING HIM TAUGHT TO SPEAK OH DOZENS OF LANGUAGES
I MISGAVE MORE THAN EVER AND HAVING ONCE LAUNCHED REGINALD ON TO THE MC KILLOPS LAWN
IT FOLLOWS THAT THEY NEVER UNDERSTOOD REGINALD WHO CAME DOWN LATE TO BREAKFAST AND NIBBLED TOAST AND SAID DISRESPECTFUL THINGS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE THE FAMILY ATE PORRIDGE AND BELIEVED IN EVERYTHING
WITH CHRISTIAN FORTITUDE AND THEN HE DIED AND LEFT HIS MONEY TO A SWINE FEVER HOSPITAL SHE FOUND SHE'D ABOUT CLEARED STOCK IN FORTITUDE BY THAT TIME AND NOW SHE GIVES DRAWING ROOM RECITATIONS THAT'S WHAT I CALL BEING VINDICTIVE
REGINALD ENTERED ON THE STRENUOUS LIFE ALONE AS FAR AS AMABEL WAS CONCERNED THE MOST VIRTUOUS WOMEN ARE NOT PROOF AGAINST DAMP GRASS AND AMABEL KEPT HER BED WITH A COLD
WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ATTACKS OF THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL VISITED ME EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF DISSIPATION AND JUST AT THE TIMES WHEN I WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM THEY CAME IN SEPARATE SPURTS AS THOUGH REMINDING ME OF THEMSELVES
TRUDOLYUBOV BARELY NODDED SIMONOV WITH WHOM I WAS LEFT TETE A TETE WAS IN A STATE OF VEXATION AND PERPLEXITY AND LOOKED AT ME QUEERLY
AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
A TALL YOUNG FELLOW IN THE ARMY WITH A COLD FACE FAIRLY HONEST THOUGH HE WORSHIPPED SUCCESS OF EVERY SORT AND WAS ONLY CAPABLE OF THINKING OF PROMOTION HE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTANT RELATION OF ZVERKOV'S AND THIS
WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
LAKE COMO BEING FOR THAT PURPOSE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ROME THEN WOULD COME A SCENE IN THE BUSHES AND SO ON AND SO ON AS THOUGH YOU DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT IT YOU WILL SAY THAT IT IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE TO DRAG ALL THIS INTO PUBLIC
BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
ALL THIS DISCONCERTED ME I SAT DOWN FEELING RATHER MISERABLE AND BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WARM AND EARNEST CONVERSATION ABOUT A FAREWELL DINNER WHICH THEY WANTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO A COMRADE OF THEIRS CALLED ZVERKOV
MY GOODNESS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO I CRIED
VEXED THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN PAY TOMORROW AFTER THE DINNER I SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW PLEASE DON'T HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM STILL MORE VEXED AS HE WALKED HE BEGAN TO STAMP WITH HIS HEELS
ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
THEY WERE MONSTROUSLY DEPRAVED OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT TOO WAS SUPERFICIAL AND AN ASSUMPTION OF CYNICISM OF COURSE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF YOUTH AND FRESHNESS EVEN IN THEIR DEPRAVITY BUT EVEN THAT FRESHNESS WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE
CURSES ON THAT SCHOOL AND ALL THOSE TERRIBLE YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE IN SHORT I PARTED FROM MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AS SOON AS I GOT OUT INTO THE WORLD THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LEFT TO WHOM I NODDED IN THE STREET ONE OF THEM WAS SIMONOV
I DID NOT REBUFF THEM FOR I WAS FLATTERED BUT WE SOON PARTED AND QUITE NATURALLY AFTERWARDS I HEARD OF HIS BARRACK ROOM SUCCESS AS A LIEUTENANT AND OF THE FAST LIFE HE WAS LEADING THEN THERE CAME OTHER RUMOURS
ON RETURNING HOME I DEFERRED FOR A TIME MY DESIRE TO EMBRACE ALL MANKIND I HAD HOWEVER ONE OTHER ACQUAINTANCE OF A SORT SIMONOV WHO WAS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I HAD A NUMBER OF SCHOOLFELLOWS INDEED IN PETERSBURG
THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM OH THERE'S NO MAKING YOU OUT WITH THESE REFINEMENTS TRUDOLYUBOV JEERED WE'LL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN SIMONOV DECIDED ADDRESSING ME
WHO HAD BEEN ALL DAY EXPECTING HIS MONTH'S WAGES BUT IN HIS FOOLISHNESS WAS UNWILLING TO BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK ABOUT IT I SLIPPED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR AND JUMPING INTO A HIGH CLASS SLEDGE ON WHICH I SPENT MY LAST HALF ROUBLE
AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
BUT WHAT MADE ME FURIOUS WAS THAT I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GO THAT I SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF GOING AND THE MORE TACTLESS THE MORE UNSEEMLY MY GOING WOULD BE THE MORE CERTAINLY I WOULD GO AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE OBSTACLE TO MY GOING
MOREOVER THEY ALL BEGAN BY DEGREES TO GRASP THAT I HAD ALREADY READ BOOKS NONE OF THEM COULD READ AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS NOT FORMING PART OF OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT EVEN HEARD THEY TOOK A SAVAGE AND SARCASTIC VIEW OF IT
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE APPLAUDING SUCH AN INSECT I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT THOUGH ZVERKOV WAS STUPID HE WAS LIVELY AND IMPUDENT AND SO LAUGHED IT OFF AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY VICTORY WAS NOT REALLY COMPLETE
THEN WHEN FAIR MORNING FIRST SMILES ON THE WORLD AND LET US TO OUR FRESH IMPLOYMENTS RISE AMONG THE GROVES THE FOUNTAINS AND THE FLOURS
METHOUGHT CLOSE AT MINE EAR ONE CALL'D ME FORTH TO WALK WITH GENTLE VOICE I THOUGHT IT THINE IT SAID WHY SLEEPST THOU EVE NOW IS THE PLEASANT TIME THE COOL THE SILENT
SO TO THE SILVAN LODGE THEY CAME THAT LIKE POMONA'S ARBOUR SMIL'D WITH FLOURETS DECK'T AND FRAGRANT SMELLS BUT EVE UNDECKT SAVE WITH HER SELF MORE LOVELY FAIR THEN WOOD NYMPH OR THE FAIREST GODDESS FEIGN'D OF THREE

THAT I METHOUGHT COULD NOT BUT TASTE FORTHWITH UP TO THE CLOUDS WITH HIM I FLEW AND UNDERNEATH BEHELD THE EARTH OUTSTRETCHT IMMENSE A PROSPECT WIDE AND VARIOUS
WHICH GIVES ME HOPE THAT WHAT IN SLEEP THOU DIDST ABHORR TO DREAM WAKING THOU NEVER WILT CONSENT TO DO BE NOT DISHEART'ND THEN NOR CLOUD THOSE LOOKS THAT WONT TO BE MORE CHEARFUL AND SERENE
IT SEEMS AS ONELY FIT FOR GODS YET ABLE TO MAKE GODS OF MEN AND WHY NOT GODS OF MEN SINCE GOOD THE MORE COMMUNICATED MORE ABUNDANT GROWES THE AUTHOR NOT IMPAIR'D
SO SAYING WITH DISPATCHFUL LOOKS IN HASTE SHE TURNS ON HOSPITABLE THOUGHTS INTENT WHAT CHOICE TO CHUSE FOR DELICACIE BEST WHAT ORDER SO CONTRIV'D AS NOT TO MIX TASTES NOT WELL JOYND INELEGANT BUT BRING TASTE AFTER TASTE
RISING OR FALLING STILL ADVANCE HIS PRAISE HIS PRAISE YE WINDS
WHERE NATURE MULTIPLIES HER FERTIL GROWTH AND BY DISBURD'NING GROWS MORE FRUITFUL WHICH INSTRUCTS US NOT TO SPARE TO WHOM THUS EVE ADAM EARTHS HALLOWD MOULD OF GOD INSPIR'D

WITH STEDDIE WING NOW ON THE POLAR WINDES THEN WITH QUICK FANN WINNOWS THE BUXOM AIR TILL WITHIN SOARE OF TOWRING EAGLES TO ALL THE FOWLES HE SEEMS A PHOENIX
MEE DAMP HORROR CHIL'D AT SUCH BOLD WORDS VOUCHT WITH A DEED SO BOLD BUT HE THUS OVERJOY'D O FRUIT DIVINE SWEET OF THY SELF BUT MUCH MORE SWEET THUS CROPT FORBIDD'N HERE
THEN RETIRES INTO HER PRIVATE CELL WHEN NATURE RESTS OFT IN HER ABSENCE MIMIC FANSIE WAKES TO IMITATE HER BUT MISJOYNING SHAPES WILDE WORK PRODUCES OFT
SO ALL WAS CLEARD AND TO THE FIELD THEY HASTE BUT FIRST FROM UNDER SHADIE ARBOROUS ROOF SOON AS THEY FORTH WERE COME TO OPEN SIGHT OF DAY SPRING AND THE SUN WHO SCARCE UP RISEN WITH WHEELS YET HOV'RING O'RE THE OCEAN BRIM
TO FIND THEE I DIRECTED THEN MY WALK AND ON METHOUGHT ALONE I PASS'D THROUGH WAYS THAT BROUGHT ME ON A SUDDEN TO THE TREE OF INTERDICTED KNOWLEDGE FAIR IT SEEM'D MUCH FAIRER TO MY FANCIE THEN BY DAY
IN COATE ROUGH OR SMOOTH RIN'D OR BEARDED HUSK OR SHELL SHE GATHERS TRIBUTE LARGE AND ON THE BOARD HEAPS WITH UNSPARING HAND FOR DRINK THE GRAPE SHE CRUSHES INOFFENSIVE MOUST AND MEATHES FROM MANY A BERRIE AND FROM SWEET KERNELS
FOR HIS SLEEP WAS AERIE LIGHT FROM PURE DIGESTION BRED AND TEMPERAT VAPORS BLAND
HOW HE DESIGNES IN THEM AT ONCE TO RUIN ALL MANKIND GO THEREFORE
SIX WINGS HE WORE TO SHADE HIS LINEAMENTS DIVINE THE PAIR THAT CLAD EACH SHOULDER BROAD CAME MANTLING O'RE HIS BREST WITH REGAL ORNAMENT THE MIDDLE PAIR GIRT LIKE A STARRIE ZONE HIS WASTE

BUT I WILL HASTE AND FROM EACH BOUGH AND BREAK EACH PLANT AND JUCIEST GOURD WILL PLUCK SUCH CHOICE TO ENTERTAIN OUR ANGEL GUEST AS HEE BEHOLDING SHALL CONFESS THAT HERE ON EARTH GOD HATH DISPENST HIS BOUNTIES AS IN HEAV'N
ADAM I THEREFORE CAME NOR ART THOU SUCH CREATED OR SUCH PLACE HAST HERE TO DWELL AS MAY NOT OFT INVITE THOUGH SPIRITS OF HEAV'N TO VISIT THEE
WHO YET BY SOV'RAN GIFT POSSESS THIS SPACIOUS GROUND
BY VIOLENCE NO FOR THAT SHALL BE WITHSTOOD BUT BY DECEIT AND LIES THIS LET HIM KNOW LEAST WILFULLY TRANSGRESSING HE PRETEND SURPRISAL UNADMONISHT UNFOREWARND
NOW
SHELTERLESS FRAGMENTS OF STRAW AND PAPER GOT UP REVOLVING STORMS THERE WHEN THE MAIN STREET WAS AT PEACE AND THE WATER CART AS IF IT WERE DRUNK OR SHORT SIGHTED CAME BLUNDERING AND JOLTING ROUND IT
AS IT WAS NOT MISTER CLAYPOLE'S HABIT TO REPOSE A BLIND AND FOOLISH CONFIDENCE IN ANYBODY IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN JUSTICE TO THAT GENTLEMAN THAT HE HAD TRUSTED CHARLOTTE TO THIS EXTENT IN ORDER THAT IF THEY WERE PURSUED
HERE YOU ARE AGAIN REPEATED MISTER WEGG MUSING AND WHAT ARE YOU NOW ARE YOU IN THE FUNNS OR WHERE ARE YOU HAVE YOU LATELY COME TO SETTLE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
AND HALF OF ALL THE YOUNG WOMAN EARNS REPLIED MISTER FAGIN WHETHER NOAH CLAYPOLE WHOSE RAPACITY WAS NONE OF THE LEAST COMPREHENSIVE WOULD HAVE ACCEDED EVEN TO THESE GLOWING TERMS
R THREE WHAT CRIPPLES SAID CHARLOTTE THREE CRIPPLES REPEATED NOAH AND A VERY GOOD SIGN TOO NOW THEN KEEP CLOSE AT MY HEELS AND COME ALONG
THAT I THINK CAN GRATIFY YOUR DARLING WISH AND PUT YOU IN THE RIGHT WAY WHERE YOU CAN TAKE WHATEVER DEPARTMENT OF THE BUSINESS YOU THINK WILL SUIT YOU BEST AT FIRST AND BE TAUGHT ALL THE OTHERS
WITH THESE INJUNCTIONS HE PUSHED THE RATTLING DOOR WITH HIS SHOULDER AND ENTERED THE HOUSE FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANION THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE BAR BUT A YOUNG JEW WHO WITH HIS TWO ELBOWS ON THE COUNTER
NOT NEAR REPLIED MISTER CLAYPOLE THERE NOT NEAR SO DON'T THINK IT WHY NOT
FIXED IN THE WALL OF THE LAST NAMED APARTMENT ABOUT FIVE FEET FROM ITS FLOORING COULD NOT ONLY LOOK DOWN UPON ANY GUESTS IN THE BACK ROOM WITHOUT ANY GREAT HAZARD OF BEING OBSERVED THE GLASS BEING IN A DARK ANGLE OF THE WALL BETWEEN WHICH
OH NOW WHAT PURSUED THE OLD FELLOW IN AN INQUISITIVE MANNER CARRYING HIS KNOTTED STICK IN HIS LEFT ARM AS IF IT WERE A BABY WHAT DO THEY ALLOW YOU NOW IT'S JOB WORK THAT I DO FOR OUR HOUSE
WERE ALL AS DRY AS THE DESERT WEGG WAS A KNOTTY MAN AND A CLOSE GRAINED WITH A FACE CARVED OUT OF VERY HARD MATERIAL THAT HAD JUST AS MUCH PLAY OF EXPRESSION AS A WATCHMAN'S RATTLE WHEN HE LAUGHED CERTAIN JERKS OCCURRED IN IT
ASKED FAGIN THERE'S A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY MADE IN SNATCHING THEIR BAGS AND PARCELS AND RUNNING ROUND THE CORNER DON'T THEY HOLLER OUT A GOOD DEAL AND SCRATCH SOMETIMES ASKED NOAH SHAKING HIS HEAD
THAT'S ENOUGH WITHOUT ANY WHY OR BECAUSE EITHER REPLIED MISTER CLAYPOLE WITH DIGNITY WELL YOU NEEDN'T BE SO CROSS SAID HIS COMPANION A PRETTY THING IT WOULD BE
DO YOU REMEMBER ME THEN ASKED HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE STOPPING IN HIS AMBLE ONE SIDED BEFORE THE STALL AND SPEAKING IN A POUNDING WAY THOUGH WITH GREAT GOOD HUMOUR
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH FAGIN FOLLOWED UP THIS REMARK BY STRIKING THE SIDE OF HIS NOSE WITH HIS RIGHT FOREFINGER A GESTURE WHICH NOAH ATTEMPTED TO IMITATE
RETURNED SILAS DRILY AND WITH RETICENCE IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE OH IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE NO IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE OH MORNING MORNING MORNING
WHAT'S THE WAGES LIVE LIKE A GENTLEMAN BOARD AND LODGING PIPES AND SPIRITS FREE
SUGGESTED FAGIN AH SOMETHING OF THAT SORT REPLIED NOAH WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD SUIT ME NOW SOMETHING NOT TOO TRYING FOR THE STRENGTH AND NOT VERY DANGEROUS YOU KNOW THAT'S THE SORT OF THING
YER'VE GOT IT NOW CHARLOTTE YER KNOW YER HAVE NO MATTER WHO'S GOT IT OR WHO DID IT MY DEAR REPLIED FAGIN GLANCING NEVERTHELESS WITH A HAWK'S EYE AT THE GIRL AND THE TWO BUNDLES
POCKETS WOMEN'S RIDICULES HOUSES MAIL COACHES BANKS SAID MISTER CLAYPOLE RISING WITH THE PORTER BUT YOU CAN'T DO ALL THAT DEAR SAID CHARLOTTE
HAVING REPLACED HIS TIN BOX ACCORDINGLY DID AS HE ROSE TO BAIT HIS GINGERBREAD TRAP FOR SOME OTHER DEVOTED INFANT THE SALUTE WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH MORNING SIR MORNING MORNING CALLS ME SIR SAID MISTER WEGG TO HIMSELF
AND DON'T YER SPEAK
YOU UNDERSTAND OH YES I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY REPLIED FAGIN TELLING THE TRUTH FOR ONCE GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT
BUT THIS ONCE DONE WAS QUITE SATISFACTORY AND HE RESTED PERSUADED THAT HE KNEW HIS WAY ABOUT THE HOUSE BLINDFOLD FROM THE BARRED GARRETS IN THE HIGH ROOF TO THE TWO IRON EXTINGUISHERS BEFORE THE MAIN DOOR
SAID NOAH GETTING HIS LEGS BY GRADUAL DEGREES ABROAD AGAIN
WITH ALL THAT HAUGHTINESS AND AIR OF SUPERIORITY BECOMING NOT ONLY A MEMBER OF THE STERNER SEX BUT A GENTLEMAN WHO APPRECIATED THE DIGNITY OF A SPECIAL APPOINTMENT ON THE KINCHIN LAY
CHARLOTTE SEE TO THEM BUNDLES THIS MANDATE WHICH HAD BEEN DELIVERED WITH GREAT MAJESTY WAS OBEYED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DEMUR
AUNT JANE UNCLE PARKER HAVING NO AUTHORITY WHATEVER FOR ANY SUCH DESIGNATIONS BUT PARTICULARLY THE LAST TO WHICH AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE HE STUCK WITH GREAT OBSTINACY
STRANGERS REPEATED THE OLD MAN
WHICH HAD BEEN EXPOSED FOR THE DAY'S SALE HE HAD TAKEN A TIN BOX FROM UNDER HIS STOOL TO PRODUCE A RELAY OF THOSE DREADFUL SPECIMENS AND WAS GOING TO LOOK IN AT THE LID WHEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF PAUSING OH HERE YOU ARE AGAIN
ANXIOUSLY REGARDING HIM SOMETHING IN THE SNEAKING WAY
WHO HAD WAITED LIKE A BRONZE STATUE OF DISCRETION DURING OUR SHORT INTERVIEW AND I WAS CONDUCTED TO THE END OF THE PASSAGE THERE WAS A TAP AT A DOOR A BULL'S BELLOW FROM WITHIN AND I WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE PROFESSOR
BUT CHANCES ARE ALL AROUND YOU
I GRIPPED MYSELF HARD AND WENT ON WITH THE ARGUMENT WE CAN'T ALL BE STANLEYS AND BURTONS SAID I BESIDES WE DON'T GET THE CHANCE AT LEAST I NEVER HAD THE CHANCE IF I DID I SHOULD TRY TO TAKE IT
EVEN IN MY SHORT LIFE I HAD LEARNED AS MUCH AS THAT
NOW SIR WHY SHOULD YOU NOT FOLLOW YOUR BRETHREN I RATHER THINK YOU MUST HE RESUMED HIS UNPLEASANT AND STEALTHY ADVANCE POINTING HIS TOES AS HE WALKED LIKE A DANCING MASTER
WHO ARRIVED IN HOLLAND AS A FUGITIVE
BEFORE I SHOULD FIND SOME DEED WHICH WAS WORTHY OF MY LADY BUT WHO WHO IN ALL THIS WIDE WORLD COULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED THE INCREDIBLE SHAPE WHICH THAT DEED WAS TO TAKE OR THE STRANGE STEPS BY WHICH I WAS LED TO THE DOING OF IT
WHO COULD LOOK DEATH IN THE FACE AND HAVE NO FEAR OF HIM A MAN OF GREAT DEEDS AND STRANGE EXPERIENCES IT IS NEVER A MAN THAT I SHOULD LOVE
THE THREAT WAS MET WITH FIRMNESS AN ANTI STRIKE LAW WAS QUICKLY PASSED THE MILITARY WAS CALLED OUT AND THE STRIKE COLLAPSED
HE HAD THE FACE AND BEARD WHICH I ASSOCIATE WITH AN ASSYRIAN BULL THE FORMER FLORID
AND HE FELL IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSSIA THAT WAS THE KIND OF MAN I MEAN THINK OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED AND HOW OTHER WOMEN MUST HAVE ENVIED HER THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ENVIED FOR MY MAN I'D HAVE DONE IT TO PLEASE YOU
THERE'S ONE MAN WHO IS STILL YOUR MASTER
BETWEEN THE TWO BOER REPUBLICS OF SOUTH AFRICA AND GREAT BRITAIN BITTER FEELINGS WERE AROUSED AND THE QUEEN DID BUT REFLECT THE NATIONAL SENTIMENT WHEN SHE PERSONALLY RECEIVED IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER PRESIDENT KRUEGER
IF YOU FIND HIM DANGEROUS REALLY DANGEROUS RING THE BELL AND HOLD HIM OFF UNTIL I COME EVEN AT HIS WORST I CAN USUALLY CONTROL HIM WITH THESE ENCOURAGING WORDS THE LADY HANDED ME OVER TO THE TACITURN AUSTIN
SPADE SHAPED AND RIPPLING DOWN OVER HIS CHEST THE HAIR WAS PECULIAR PLASTERED DOWN IN FRONT IN A LONG CURVING WISP OVER HIS MASSIVE FOREHEAD THE EYES WERE BLUE GRAY UNDER GREAT BLACK TUFTS VERY CLEAR
YOU WERE IN TROUBLE LAST MONTH FOR THE SAME THING YOU'VE BLACKENED THIS YOUNG MAN'S EYE
HE SAT IN A ROTATING CHAIR BEHIND A BROAD TABLE WHICH WAS COVERED WITH BOOKS MAPS AND DIAGRAMS AS I ENTERED HIS SEAT SPUN ROUND TO FACE ME HIS APPEARANCE MADE ME GASP
WITHOUT HEAVY EXPENDITURE AND THE MEANS WERE NOT FORTHCOMING TO MEET THE DEMAND A BILL WAS INTRODUCED IN AUGUST NINETEEN ELEVEN BY THE FINANCE MINISTER DOCTOR KOLKMAR
WHAT IS IT THAT HE DOES THAT I DON'T DO JUST SAY THE WORD TEETOTAL VEGETARIAN AERONAUT THEOSOPHIST SUPERMAN I'LL HAVE A TRY AT IT GLADYS IF YOU WILL ONLY GIVE ME AN IDEA WHAT WOULD PLEASE YOU

DEALT WITH MANY SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE PERSONAL MILITARY SERVICE WAS AT LAST AFTER YEARS OF CONTROVERSY ENFORCED BY LAW
AND SO IT WAS THAT I FOUND MYSELF THAT FOGGY NOVEMBER EVENING PURSUING THE CAMBERWELL TRAM WITH MY HEART GLOWING WITHIN ME AND WITH THE EAGER DETERMINATION THAT NOT ANOTHER DAY SHOULD ELAPSE
INTO THE WONDERFUL MYSTIC TWILIGHT LAND WHERE LIE THE GREAT ADVENTURES AND THE GREAT REWARDS BEHOLD ME THEN AT THE OFFICE OF THE DAILY GAZETTE ON THE STAFF OF WHICH I WAS A MOST INSIGNIFICANT UNIT
COULD YOU NOT HAVE GONE DOWN AND HELPED THOSE PEOPLE IN SPITE OF THE CHOKE DAMP I DID YOU NEVER SAID SO THERE WAS NOTHING WORTH BUCKING ABOUT I DIDN'T KNOW SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH RATHER MORE INTEREST
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUCH EXTRAORDINARY NOTIONS OF HUMOR IT WAS NEARLY HALF PAST TEN BEFORE I HAD RECEIVED MY MESSAGE BUT A TAXICAB TOOK ME ROUND IN GOOD TIME FOR MY APPOINTMENT
BUT FORTUNATELY I WAS RESCUED FROM AN ODIOUS SITUATION A POLICEMAN WAS BESIDE US HIS NOTEBOOK IN HIS HAND WHAT'S ALL THIS YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED SAID THE POLICEMAN IT WAS THE MOST RATIONAL REMARK WHICH I HAD HEARD IN ENMORE PARK
ONE MUST WAIT TILL IT COMES BUT WHY CAN'T YOU LOVE ME GLADYS IS IT MY APPEARANCE OR WHAT SHE DID UNBEND A LITTLE SHE PUT FORWARD A HAND SUCH A GRACIOUS STOOPING ATTITUDE IT WAS
IT IS MOST CONSIDERATE OF YOU MADAM GET QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM IF HE SEEMS INCLINED TO BE VIOLENT DON'T WAIT TO ARGUE WITH HIM SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED THROUGH DOING THAT AFTERWARDS THERE IS A PUBLIC SCANDAL AND IT REFLECTS UPON ME AND ALL OF US
WE DID A CATHARINE WHEEL TOGETHER DOWN THE PASSAGE SOMEHOW WE GATHERED UP A CHAIR UPON OUR WAY AND BOUNDED ON WITH IT TOWARDS THE STREET
ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL UP TO THE AGE OF THIRTEEN WAS MADE OBLIGATORY
AND PERFECTLY UNSEXUAL MY INSTINCTS ARE ALL AGAINST A WOMAN BEING TOO FRANK AND AT HER EASE WITH ME IT IS NO COMPLIMENT TO A MAN WHERE THE REAL SEX FEELING BEGINS TIMIDITY AND DISTRUST ARE ITS COMPANIONS
HE ASKED AN APPOINTMENT GOT YOUR LETTER I PRODUCED THE ENVELOPE RIGHT HE SEEMED TO BE A PERSON OF FEW WORDS FOLLOWING HIM DOWN THE PASSAGE I WAS SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED BY A SMALL WOMAN
WITH SAM CLARK KENNICOTT AND CAROL PRESENT THAT'S THE WAY TO TREAT THOSE FELLOWS
THERE WERE ONLY THREE THINGS WHICH SHE COULD DO HAVE CHILDREN START HER CAREER OF REFORMING OR BECOME SO DEFINITELY A PART OF THE TOWN THAT SHE WOULD BE FULFILLED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF CHURCH AND STUDY CLUB AND BRIDGE PARTIES
WHICH MADE THE REARING OF CITIZENS MORE COSTLY AND PERILOUS THAN ANY OTHER CRIME IT WAS INADVISABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN TILL HE HAD MADE MORE MONEY SHE WAS SORRY PERHAPS HE HAD MADE ALL THE MYSTERY OF LOVE A MECHANICAL CAUTIOUSNESS BUT
THE BOYS WORE SHOE PACKS BLUE FLANNEL SHIRTS WITH ENORMOUS PEARL BUTTONS AND MACKINAWS OF CRIMSON LEMON YELLOW AND FOXY BROWN CAROL CRIED FINE DAY TO THE BOYS SHE CAME IN A GLOW TO HOWLAND AND GOULD'S GROCERY
OH PLEASE WAIT TILL MY GENERATION HAS STOPPED REBELLING BEFORE YOURS STARTS IN WHAT'S A GENERATION IT'S A RAY IN THE ILLUMINATION OF THE SPIRIT THAT'S FOOLISH
WHY YOU SAY HE'S A ROUGHNECK AND YOU WON'T JUMP ON THE BAND WAGON ONCE WHEN KENNICOTT ANNOUNCED AT NOON DINNER
AND EVERYWHERE WAS A RHYTHMIC SOUND OF WOOD SAWING IT WAS SATURDAY AND THE NEIGHBORS SONS WERE GETTING UP THE WINTER FUEL BEHIND WALLS OF CORDED WOOD IN BACK YARDS THEIR SAWBUCKS STOOD IN DEPRESSIONS SCATTERED WITH CANARY YELLOW FLAKES OF SAWDUST
BUT EVER SO MUCH SICKER ON NO COOKIES AT ALL THAT'S FOOLISH IT IS O MALE KENNICOTT HUH SAID KENNICOTT TWO AND WENT TO SLEEP ON HER SHOULDER
SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH UNPLEASANT LUCIDITY SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE PEOPLE LIKED HER SHE HAD GONE TO THE WOMEN AT AFTERNOON COFFEES TO THE MERCHANTS IN THEIR STORES WITH SO MANY OUTPOURING COMMENTS AND WHIMSIES
I DON'T BELONG TO GOPHER PRAIRIE THAT ISN'T MEANT AS A CONDEMNATION OF GOPHER PRAIRIE AND IT MAY BE A CONDEMNATION OF ME ALL RIGHT I DON'T CARE I DON'T BELONG HERE AND I'M GOING I'M NOT ASKING PERMISSION ANY MORE I'M SIMPLY GOING HE GRUNTED

THAT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE SHE SAW THE DOOR KNOBS THE NEWSPAPER ON THE TABLE EVERY WHITE SURFACE AS DAZZLING MAUVE AND HER HEAD WAS DIZZY IN THE PYROTECHNIC DIMNESS WHEN HER EYES HAD RECOVERED SHE FELT EXPANDED DRUNK WITH HEALTH MISTRESS OF LIFE

WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ANY TOWN OF ANYWHERES NEAR OUR SIZE IN THE STATE THAT HAS SUCH A STERLING WAR RECORD ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'D BETTER WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW
AND YOU AND ALL THESE LONG HAIRED MEN AND SHORT HAIRED WOMEN CAN BEEF ALL YOU WANT TO BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE FELLOWS AND IF THEY AIN'T PATRIOTIC WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM BE PATRIOTIC AND LORD KNOWS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO SAY THIS TO MY OWN WIFE
BUT IF YOU GO DEFENDING THESE FELLOWS THEN THE SAME THING APPLIES TO YOU NEXT THING I SUPPOSE YOU'LL BE YAPPING ABOUT FREE SPEECH FREE SPEECH THERE'S TOO MUCH FREE SPEECH AND FREE GAS AND FREE BEER AND FREE LOVE
AND WHEN HE WAS LOST SHE WANTED TO LEAP FROM THE VESTIBULE AND RUN BACK TO HIM SHE THOUGHT OF A HUNDRED TENDERNESSES SHE HAD NEGLECTED SHE HAD HER FREEDOM AND IT WAS EMPTY THE MOMENT WAS NOT THE HIGHEST OF HER LIFE BUT THE LOWEST AND MOST DESOLATE
THE WORLD WAS SO LUMINOUS THAT SHE SAT DOWN AT HER RICKETY LITTLE DESK IN THE LIVING ROOM TO MAKE A POEM SHE GOT NO FARTHER THAN THE SKY IS BRIGHT THE SUN IS WARM THERE NE'ER WILL BE ANOTHER STORM
HE WAS A SERIOUS AND LITERAL PERSON AND RATHER HUMORLESS SHE KISSED HIS FROWN AND MARVELED I AM RUNNING AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND AFTER LIKING A SWEDISH NE'ER DO WELL AND EXPRESSING IMMORAL OPINIONS JUST AS IN A ROMANTIC STORY
BUT WHEN SNOW HAD ENDED THE SKATING AND SHE TRIED TO GET UP A MOONLIGHT SLIDING PARTY THE MATRONS HESITATED TO STIR AWAY FROM THEIR RADIATORS AND THEIR DAILY BRIDGE WHIST IMITATIONS OF THE CITY SHE HAD TO NAG THEM THEY SCOOTED DOWN A LONG HILL ON A BOB SLED
HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON BESIDES THE REPAIRMAN AT SAM CLARK'S WHO UNDERSTOOD PLUMBING EVERYBODY BEGGED HIM TO LOOK OVER THE FURNACE AND THE WATER PIPES HE RUSHED FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE TILL AFTER BEDTIME TEN O'CLOCK
CYNICAL SANTA CLAUS CHILDREN LOVED HIM AND HE SNEAKED AWAY FROM WORK TO TELL THEM IMPROBABLE STORIES OF SEA FARING AND HORSE TRADING AND BEARS THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS EITHER LAUGHED AT HIM OR HATED HIM HE WAS THE ONE DEMOCRAT IN TOWN
WE MUST GO AND SEARCH FOR WATER SHE SAID TO HIM WHY DO YOU WANT WATER HE ASKED TO WASH MY FACE CLEAN AFTER THE DUST OF THE ROAD AND TO DRINK SO THE DRY BREAD WILL NOT STICK IN MY THROAT
AND INVITED HER TO SUPPER AND TO PASS THE NIGHT WITH THEM FOR THIS WAS THE HOME OF ONE OF THE RICHEST MUNCHKINS IN THE LAND AND HIS FRIENDS WERE GATHERED WITH HIM TO CELEBRATE THEIR FREEDOM FROM THE BONDAGE OF THE WICKED WITCH
THEREUPON THE WICKED WITCH ENCHANTED MY AXE AND WHEN I WAS CHOPPING AWAY AT MY BEST ONE DAY FOR I WAS ANXIOUS TO GET THE NEW HOUSE AND MY WIFE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE AXE SLIPPED ALL AT ONCE AND CUT OFF MY LEFT LEG
AND ARE GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR THE FAVOR WHO ARE THE MUNCHKINS INQUIRED DOROTHY THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THIS LAND OF THE EAST WHERE THE WICKED WITCH RULED ARE YOU A MUNCHKIN ASKED DOROTHY NO BUT I AM THEIR FRIEND
AND HE OFTEN GROWLED IN AN UNFRIENDLY WAY AT THE SCARECROW DON'T MIND TOTO SAID DOROTHY TO HER NEW FRIEND HE NEVER BITES OH I'M NOT AFRAID REPLIED THE SCARECROW HE CAN'T HURT THE STRAW DO LET ME CARRY THAT BASKET FOR YOU
HER SILVER SHOES TINKLING MERRILY ON THE HARD YELLOW ROAD BED THE SUN SHONE BRIGHT AND THE BIRDS SANG SWEETLY AND DOROTHY DID NOT FEEL NEARLY SO BAD AS YOU MIGHT THINK A LITTLE GIRL
BUT I DO NOT WANT PEOPLE TO CALL ME A FOOL AND IF MY HEAD STAYS STUFFED WITH STRAW INSTEAD OF WITH BRAINS AS YOURS IS HOW AM I EVER TO KNOW ANYTHING I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL
AND AT ITS EDGE IS THE SAME GREAT DESERT THAT SURROUNDS THIS LAND OF OZ I'M AFRAID MY DEAR YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH US DOROTHY BEGAN TO SOB AT THIS FOR SHE FELT LONELY AMONG ALL THESE STRANGE PEOPLE
BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN AFRAID EVEN TO GROWL WHILE SHE STOOD BY BUT DOROTHY KNOWING HER TO BE A WITCH
FIVE LITTLE FIDDLERS PLAYED AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE AND THE PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AND SINGING WHILE A BIG TABLE NEAR BY WAS LOADED WITH DELICIOUS FRUITS AND NUTS PIES AND CAKES
YOUR HOUSE DID ANYWAY REPLIED THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WITH A LAUGH AND THAT IS THE SAME THING SEE SHE CONTINUED POINTING TO THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE THERE ARE HER TWO FEET STILL STICKING OUT FROM UNDER A BLOCK OF WOOD DOROTHY LOOKED
AND WHY IS THAT ASKED THE SCARECROW I WILL TELL YOU MY STORY AND THEN YOU WILL KNOW SO WHILE THEY WERE WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST THE TIN WOODMAN TOLD THE FOLLOWING STORY
SAID THE SCARECROW WITH A SMILE FOR IT IS VERY TEDIOUS BEING PERCHED UP HERE NIGHT AND DAY TO SCARE AWAY CROWS CAN'T YOU GET DOWN ASKED DOROTHY NO FOR THIS POLE IS STUCK UP MY BACK
THE GIRL WASHED HERSELF CAREFULLY DRESSED HERSELF IN THE CLEAN GINGHAM AND TIED HER PINK SUNBONNET ON HER HEAD SHE TOOK A LITTLE BASKET AND FILLED IT WITH BREAD FROM THE CUPBOARD LAYING A WHITE CLOTH OVER THE TOP
OIL MY NECK FIRST REPLIED THE TIN WOODMAN SO SHE OILED IT
SAID THE GIRL WHO WAS HALF FRIGHTENED AT FACING A REAL WITCH OH NO THAT IS A GREAT MISTAKE THERE WERE ONLY FOUR WITCHES IN ALL THE LAND OF OZ AND TWO OF THEM
HER TEARS SEEMED TO GRIEVE THE KIND HEARTED MUNCHKINS FOR THEY IMMEDIATELY TOOK OUT THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS AND BEGAN TO WEEP ALSO AS FOR THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN SHE TOOK OFF HER CAP AND BALANCED THE POINT ON THE END OF HER NOSE WHILE SHE COUNTED ONE TWO
FINDING IT JUST WHAT SHE WANTED TO HELP OUT HER BREAKFAST THEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND HAVING HELPED HERSELF AND TOTO TO A GOOD DRINK OF THE COOL CLEAR WATER SHE SET ABOUT MAKING READY FOR THE JOURNEY TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS
WHERE HER LIPS TOUCHED THE GIRL THEY LEFT A ROUND SHINING MARK AS DOROTHY FOUND OUT SOON AFTER THE ROAD TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS IS PAVED WITH YELLOW BRICK SAID THE WITCH SO YOU CANNOT MISS IT
IF YOU WILL PLEASE TAKE AWAY THE POLE I SHALL BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU DOROTHY REACHED UP BOTH ARMS AND LIFTED THE FIGURE OFF THE POLE FOR BEING STUFFED WITH STRAW IT WAS QUITE LIGHT
BUT MY ACTION ANGERED THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST FOR SHE HAD PROMISED THE OLD WOMAN I SHOULD NOT MARRY THE PRETTY MUNCHKIN GIRL WHEN I BEGAN CHOPPING AGAIN MY AXE SLIPPED AND CUT OFF MY RIGHT LEG AGAIN I WENT TO THE TINSMITH AND AGAIN HE MADE ME A LEG OUT OF TIN
THEY TURNED AND WALKED THROUGH THE FOREST A FEW STEPS WHEN DOROTHY DISCOVERED SOMETHING SHINING IN A RAY OF SUNSHINE THAT FELL BETWEEN THE TREES SHE RAN TO THE PLACE AND THEN STOPPED SHORT WITH A LITTLE CRY OF SURPRISE
WHILE I WAS IN LOVE I WAS THE HAPPIEST MAN ON EARTH BUT NO ONE CAN LOVE WHO HAS NOT A HEART AND SO I AM RESOLVED TO ASK OZ TO GIVE ME ONE IF HE DOES I WILL GO BACK TO THE MUNCHKIN MAIDEN AND MARRY HER
THE WITCH OF THE NORTH SEEMED TO THINK FOR A TIME WITH HER HEAD BOWED AND HER EYES UPON THE GROUND THEN SHE LOOKED UP AND SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHERE KANSAS IS FOR I HAVE NEVER HEARD THAT COUNTRY MENTIONED BEFORE BUT TELL ME
WHAT WORRIED HER MOST WAS THAT THE BREAD WAS NEARLY GONE AND ANOTHER MEAL FOR HERSELF AND TOTO WOULD EMPTY THE BASKET TO BE SURE NEITHER THE WOODMAN NOR THE SCARECROW EVER ATE ANYTHING
THEY WORE ROUND HATS THAT ROSE TO A SMALL POINT A FOOT ABOVE THEIR HEADS WITH LITTLE BELLS AROUND THE BRIMS THAT TINKLED SWEETLY AS THEY MOVED THE HATS OF THE MEN WERE BLUE THE LITTLE WOMAN'S HAT WAS WHITE
AND THE SCARECROW WANTS HIM TO PUT A FEW BRAINS INTO HIS HEAD SHE REPLIED THE TIN WOODMAN APPEARED TO THINK DEEPLY FOR A MOMENT
THERE WERE LOVELY PATCHES OF GREENSWARD ALL ABOUT WITH STATELY TREES BEARING RICH AND LUSCIOUS FRUITS BANKS OF GORGEOUS FLOWERS WERE ON EVERY HAND AND BIRDS WITH RARE AND BRILLIANT PLUMAGE SANG AND FLUTTERED IN THE TREES AND BUSHES
BUT ALAS I HAD NOW NO HEART SO THAT I LOST ALL MY LOVE FOR THE MUNCHKIN GIRL AND DID NOT CARE WHETHER I MARRIED HER OR NOT I SUPPOSE SHE IS STILL LIVING WITH THE OLD WOMAN WAITING FOR ME TO COME AFTER HER
OF ONLY ONE OF MY SENSES I HEARD MY GLASS REMOVED THE SAME WHICH IS THERE NOW ON THE TABLE OH DEAR MOTHER IT WAS A DREAM SO LITTLE WAS IT A DREAM THAT I STRETCHED MY HAND TOWARDS THE BELL
IS DEAD ANSWERED THE OLD MARCHIONESS
WE EXPECT HIM EVERY MOMENT IT IS WELL AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES INFORM ME WE MUST BE EXPEDITIOUS AND THEN I ALSO WISH TO SEE A NOTARY THAT I MAY BE ASSURED
DO NOT YIELD TO THOSE GLOOMY THOUGHTS YOU WILL LONG LIVE WITH US HAPPY LOVED AND HONORED AND WE WILL MAKE YOU FORGET NEVER NEVER NEVER SAID THE MARCHIONESS
OH MY POOR MOTHER SAID VILLEFORT TO HAVE SUCH DUTIES TO PERFORM AT YOUR AGE AFTER SUCH A BLOW GOD HAS SUPPORTED ME THROUGH ALL AND THEN
WHERE SHE BURIED HER VENERABLE HEAD VILLEFORT LEFT HER TO THE CARE OF THE WOMEN WHILE OLD BARROIS RAN HALF SCARED TO HIS MASTER FOR NOTHING FRIGHTENS OLD PEOPLE SO MUCH
AND INSTEAD OF DWELLING UPON THE POLITICAL FUTURE THAT HAD SO OFTEN BEEN THE SUBJECT OF HIS AMBITIOUS DREAMS WAS IMAGINING A FUTURE LIMITED TO THE ENJOYMENTS OF HOME IN FEAR OF AWAKENING THE ENEMY THAT HAD SO LONG SLEPT
A DOCTOR SAID SHE SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS I AM NOT ILL I AM THIRSTY THAT IS ALL WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING DEAR GRANDMAMMA THE SAME AS USUAL MY DEAR MY GLASS IS THERE ON THE TABLE
VALENTINE CAME UP TO NOIRTIER ON LEAVING MADAME DE SAINT MERAN WHO IN THE MIDST OF HER GRIEF HAD AT LAST YIELDED TO FATIGUE AND FALLEN INTO A FEVERISH SLEEP WITHIN REACH OF HER HAND THEY PLACED A SMALL TABLE
YOUR GRANDMAMMA HAS JUST ARRIVED VALENTINE
THAT DETER WEAK MINDS FROM PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE I ALSO WAS MARRIED AT THE DEATH BED OF MY MOTHER AND CERTAINLY I HAVE NOT BEEN LESS HAPPY ON THAT ACCOUNT STILL THAT IDEA OF DEATH MADAME SAID VILLEFORT STILL
ON THE CONTRARY HER EYES GLISTENED AND SHE APPEARED TO BE SUFFERING FROM VIOLENT NERVOUS IRRITABILITY OH DEAR GRANDMAMMA ARE YOU WORSE EXCLAIMED VALENTINE PERCEIVING ALL THESE SIGNS OF AGITATION
YES SAID VALENTINE HE WAS VERY FOND OF ME WHO DOES NOT LOVE YOU VALENTINE SMILED SADLY WHAT ARE YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S SYMPTOMS AN EXTREME NERVOUS EXCITEMENT AND A STRANGELY AGITATED SLEEP
YOU MADAME YOU DEAR MAMMA
WITH MY EYES SHUT IN THE SPOT WHERE YOU ARE NOW STANDING ISSUING FROM THAT CORNER WHERE THERE IS A DOOR LEADING INTO MADAME VILLEFORT'S DRESSING ROOM I SAW I TELL YOU SILENTLY ENTER A WHITE FIGURE
HAD FOLLOWED HIS WIFE MEANWHILE BARROIS HAD RETURNED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO OLD NOIRTIER WHO HAVING HEARD THE NOISE IN THE HOUSE HAD AS WE HAVE SAID SENT HIS OLD SERVANT TO INQUIRE THE CAUSE ON HIS RETURN
WHAT A MISFORTUNE I SHALL DIE OF IT OH YES I SHALL CERTAINLY DIE OF IT AND THEN FALLING UPON THE CHAIR NEAREST THE DOOR SHE BURST INTO A PAROXYSM OF SOBS THE SERVANTS
AND DIFFICULT AND HER PULSE BEAT WITH FEVERISH EXCITEMENT SHE WAS THINKING OF THE DESPAIR OF MAXIMILIAN WHEN HE SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT MADAME DE SAINT MERAN INSTEAD OF BEING AN ALLY WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ACTING AS HIS ENEMY
AS WHEN DEATH RELAXES ITS VIGILANCE OVER THEM FOR A MOMENT IN ORDER TO STRIKE SOME OTHER OLD PERSON THEN WHILE MADAME DE SAINT MERAN REMAINED ON HER KNEES PRAYING FERVENTLY
OUR BUSINESS CONCERNS VALENTINE LET US LEAVE THE DEAD IN PEACE ALL THIS WAS SAID WITH SUCH EXCEEDING RAPIDITY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE CONVERSATION THAT SEEMED LIKE THE BEGINNING OF DELIRIUM
AND VALENTINE KNEW HOW THE HAUGHTY MARQUISE DE SAINT MERAN DESPISED ALL WHO WERE NOT NOBLE HER SECRET HAD EACH TIME BEEN REPRESSED
WHOM YOU HAVE SO SOON FORGOTTEN SIR AH MADAME SAID VILLEFORT YOU FORGET THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE A MOTHER TO MY CHILD A STEPMOTHER IS NEVER A MOTHER SIR BUT THIS IS NOT TO THE PURPOSE
WHEN THEY WISH TO APPEAR INTERESTED IN THEIR MASTER'S GRIEF HE DREW BACK THE BOLT OF HIS DOOR AND ALMOST DIRECTLY AN OLD LADY ENTERED UNANNOUNCED CARRYING HER SHAWL ON HER ARM AND HER BONNET IN HER HAND
SON OF A SHIPOWNER OF MALTA DISCOVERER OF A MINE IN THESSALY NOW VISITING PARIS FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT INTEREST I SAY CAN HE TAKE IN DISCOVERING A GLOOMY MYSTERIOUS AND USELESS FACT LIKE THIS HOWEVER
NONE OF MY ENEMIES WOULD HAVE WAITED SO PATIENTLY AND LABORIOUSLY FOR SO LONG A SPACE OF TIME THAT THEY MIGHT NOW COME AND CRUSH ME WITH THIS SECRET SOMETIMES AS HAMLET SAYS FOUL DEEDS WILL RISE
VILLEFORT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE TO REPLY THAT VALENTINE WAS AT A BALL SO HE ONLY SAID THAT SHE HAD GONE OUT WITH HER STEP MOTHER AND THAT SHE SHOULD BE FETCHED THIS INSTANT SIR THIS INSTANT I BESEECH YOU
VALENTINE SCREAMED IT WAS THE FEVER THAT DISTURBED YOU MADAME SAID VILLEFORT DOUBT IF YOU PLEASE BUT I AM SURE OF WHAT I SAY I SAW A WHITE FIGURE AND AS IF TO PREVENT MY DISCREDITING THE TESTIMONY
THE WHITE HAIR WAS THROWN BACK FROM HER YELLOW FOREHEAD AND HER EYES ALREADY SUNKEN BY THE FURROWS OF AGE NOW ALMOST DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE EYELIDS SWOLLEN WITH GRIEF OH SIR SHE SAID OH SIR
IMMEDIATELY BUT AS I HAVE TOLD YOU IT WAS TOO LATE YES BUT THEN HE COULD TELL
STEP THIS WAY SIR IF YOU PLEASE IT'S ONLY ONCE A YEAR SIR PLEADED BOB APPEARING FROM THE TANK IT SHALL NOT BE REPEATED I WAS MAKING RATHER MERRY YESTERDAY SIR
STIRRING COLD COLD PIPING FOR THE BLOOD TO DANCE TO GOLDEN SUNLIGHT HEAVENLY SKY SWEET FRESH AIR MERRY BELLS
AND TEAR THEM TO PIECES O YOU FOOL SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU MAY AS WELL PLANE THE PLANKS FOR OUR COFFINS AND SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE
NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY FRIEND SAID SCROOGE I AM NOT GOING TO STAND THIS SORT OF THING ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE HE CONTINUED LEAPING FROM HIS STOOL
IF THE WILD BEASTS IN THE FOREST HAD BUT DEVOURED US WE SHOULD AT ANY RATE HAVE DIED TOGETHER JUST KEEP YOUR NOISE TO YOURSELF SAID THE OLD WOMAN IT WON'T HELP YOU AT ALL
TOWN OR BOROUGH IN THE GOOD OLD WORLD SOME PEOPLE LAUGHED TO SEE THE ALTERATION IN HIM BUT HE LET THEM LAUGH AND LITTLE HEEDED THEM FOR HE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW
THEY SAW A BEAUTIFUL SNOW WHITE BIRD SITTING ON A BOUGH WHICH SANG SO DELIGHTFULLY THAT THEY STOOD STILL AND LISTENED TO IT AND WHEN ITS SONG WAS OVER IT SPREAD ITS WINGS AND FLEW AWAY BEFORE THEM
NOT LONG AFTERWARDS THERE WAS ONCE MORE GREAT DEARTH THROUGHOUT THE LAND AND THE CHILDREN HEARD THEIR MOTHER SAYING AT NIGHT TO THEIR FATHER
THAT THEY LET FALL WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR HANDS THE OLD WOMAN HOWEVER NODDED HER HEAD AND SAID OH YOU DEAR CHILDREN WHO HAS BROUGHT YOU HERE DO COME IN AND STAY WITH ME
HALLO HE HAD FRISKED INTO THE SITTING ROOM AND WAS NOW STANDING THERE PERFECTLY WINDED THERE'S THE SAUCEPAN THAT THE GRUEL WAS IN CRIED SCROOGE
I THANK YOU FIFTY TIMES BLESS YOU HE WENT TO CHURCH AND WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE HURRYING TO AND FRO AND PATTED CHILDREN ON THE HEAD AND QUESTIONED BEGGARS
NOW CHILDREN LAY YOURSELVES DOWN BY THE FIRE AND REST WE WILL GO INTO THE FOREST AND CUT SOME WOOD WHEN WE HAVE DONE WE WILL COME BACK AND FETCH YOU AWAY HANSEL AND GRETEL
UNTIL THE MOON HAS RISEN AND THEN WE WILL SOON FIND THE WAY AND WHEN THE FULL MOON HAD RISEN HANSEL TOOK HIS LITTLE SISTER BY THE HAND AND FOLLOWED THE PEBBLES WHICH SHONE LIKE NEWLY COINED SILVER PIECES

WITH THEIR PLUMP AND ROSY CHEEKS SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF THAT WILL BE A DAINTY MOUTHFUL THEN SHE SEIZED HANSEL WITH HER SHRIVELLED HAND CARRIED HIM INTO A LITTLE STABLE
AND AS THEY WERE SO WEARY THAT THEIR LEGS WOULD CARRY THEM NO LONGER THEY LAY DOWN BENEATH A TREE AND FELL ASLEEP IT WAS NOW THREE MORNINGS SINCE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE
TURKEY HE NEVER COULD HAVE STOOD UPON HIS LEGS THAT BIRD HE WOULD HAVE SNAPPED EM SHORT OFF IN A MINUTE LIKE STICKS OF SEALING WAX WHY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY THAT TO CAMDEN TOWN SAID SCROOGE
DRIVING AWAY WITH HIS PEN AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO OVERTAKE NINE O'CLOCK HALLO GROWLED SCROOGE IN HIS ACCUSTOMED VOICE AS NEAR AS HE COULD FEIGN IT

WERE ONLY TO BE EXCEEDED BY THE CHUCKLE WITH WHICH HE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN AND CHUCKLED TILL HE CRIED SHAVING WAS NOT AN EASY TASK
AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE HAZEL TREE THE WHITE DOVE SANG HOME HOME LOOK AT THE SHOE PRINCESS THE SHOE WAS MADE FOR YOU PRINCE PRINCE TAKE HOME THY BRIDE FOR SHE IS THE TRUE ONE THAT SITS BY THY SIDE
LONG BEFORE THE END OF THE HOUR THE WORK WAS QUITE DONE AND ALL FLEW OUT AGAIN AT THE WINDOWS THEN ASHPUTTEL BROUGHT THE DISH TO HER MOTHER OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT THAT NOW SHE SHOULD GO TO THE BALL BUT THE MOTHER SAID NO NO YOU SLUT
ONE AND ALL COME HELP ME QUICK HASTE YE HASTE YE PICK PICK PICK THEN FIRST CAME TWO WHITE DOVES FLYING IN AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW NEXT CAME TWO TURTLE DOVES AND AFTER THEM CAME ALL THE LITTLE BIRDS UNDER HEAVEN

BUT THE MOTHER SAID NO NO SHE IS MUCH TOO DIRTY SHE WILL NOT DARE TO SHOW HERSELF HOWEVER THE PRINCE WOULD HAVE HER COME AND SHE FIRST WASHED HER FACE AND HANDS AND THEN WENT IN AND CURTSIED TO HIM AND HE REACHED HER THE GOLDEN SLIPPER THEN SHE TOOK HER CLUMSY SHOE OFF HER LEFT FOOT
YOU HAVE NO CLOTHES AND CANNOT DANCE YOU SHALL NOT GO AND WHEN ASHPUTTEL BEGGED VERY HARD TO GO SHE SAID IF YOU CAN IN ONE HOUR'S TIME PICK TWO OF THOSE DISHES OF PEAS OUT OF THE ASHES YOU SHALL GO TOO AND THUS
BUT WHEN THEY HAD BROKEN OPEN THE DOOR THEY FOUND NO ONE WITHIN AND AS THEY CAME BACK INTO THE HOUSE ASHPUTTEL WAS LYING AS SHE ALWAYS DID IN HER DIRTY FROCK BY THE ASHES AND HER DIM LITTLE LAMP WAS BURNING IN THE CHIMNEY FOR SHE HAD RUN AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD THROUGH THE PIGEON HOUSE
AND THERE HE SAW TWO OLD RAVENS STANDING BY THEIR NEST AND THROWING OUT THEIR YOUNG ONES OUT WITH YOU YOU IDLE GOOD FOR NOTHING CREATURES CRIED THEY WE CANNOT FIND FOOD FOR YOU ANY LONGER YOU ARE BIG ENOUGH AND CAN PROVIDE FOR YOURSELVES BUT THE POOR YOUNG RAVENS LAY UPON THE GROUND
HE HEARD THEM LAMENTING THAT THEY MUST PERISH SO MISERABLY AND AS HE HAD A KIND HEART HE GOT OFF HIS HORSE AND PUT THE THREE PRISONERS BACK INTO THE WATER THEY LEAPT
AND ON HIS WAY HOME AS HE RODE THROUGH A GREEN COPSE A HAZEL TWIG BRUSHED AGAINST HIM AND ALMOST PUSHED OFF HIS HAT SO HE BROKE IT OFF AND BROUGHT IT AWAY AND WHEN HE GOT HOME HE GAVE IT TO HIS DAUGHTER THEN SHE TOOK IT
TO GRETEL MOTHER BEHAVE WELL HANS OH I'LL BEHAVE WELL GOODBYE MOTHER GOODBYE HANS HANS COMES TO GRETEL GOOD DAY GRETEL GOOD DAY HANS WHAT GOOD THING DO YOU BRING I BRING NOTHING I WANT SOMETHING GIVEN ME
AND HE SAW BY THE BLOOD THAT STREAMED FROM IT WHAT A TRICK SHE HAD PLAYED HIM
EATING THE SNAKE HAD GIVEN HIM POWER OF UNDERSTANDING THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALS NOW IT SO HAPPENED THAT ON THIS VERY DAY THE QUEEN LOST HER MOST BEAUTIFUL RING AND SUSPICION OF HAVING STOLEN IT FELL UPON THIS TRUSTY SERVANT
BUT WAITED TILL HER FATHER CAME HOME AND SAID TO HIM THE UNKNOWN LADY WHO DANCED WITH ME HAS SLIPPED AWAY
THEY WHO WOULD EAT BREAD SHOULD FIRST EARN IT AWAY WITH THE KITCHEN MAID THEN THEY TOOK AWAY HER FINE CLOTHES AND GAVE HER AN OLD GREY FROCK TO PUT ON AND LAUGHED AT HER AND TURNED HER INTO THE KITCHEN THERE
IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE WAS TIRED SHE HAD NO BED TO LIE DOWN ON BUT WAS MADE TO LIE BY THE HEARTH AMONG THE ASHES AND AS THIS OF COURSE MADE HER ALWAYS DUSTY AND DIRTY THEY CALLED HER ASHPUTTEL
HE WAS DISMISSED WITH NO BETTER ANSWER IN HIS TROUBLE AND FEAR HE WENT DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD AND TOOK THOUGHT HOW TO HELP HIMSELF OUT OF HIS TROUBLE NOW SOME DUCKS WERE SITTING TOGETHER QUIETLY BY A BROOK AND TAKING THEIR REST
WAS BROUGHT TO HIM THROUGH THE AIR BUT HE HAD A STRANGE CUSTOM EVERY DAY AFTER DINNER WHEN THE TABLE WAS CLEARED AND NO ONE ELSE WAS PRESENT A TRUSTY SERVANT HAD TO BRING HIM ONE MORE DISH IT WAS COVERED HOWEVER
GOOD DAY HANS WHAT GOOD THING DO YOU BRING I BRING NOTHING BUT WOULD HAVE SOMETHING GIVEN GRETEL SAYS TO HANS I WILL GO WITH YOU HANS TAKES GRETEL TIES HER TO A ROPE LEADS HER TO THE RACK AND BINDS HER FAST THEN HANS GOES TO HIS MOTHER
THAT SHE BROUGHT HOME WITH HER THEY WERE FAIR IN FACE BUT FOUL AT HEART AND IT WAS NOW A SORRY TIME FOR THE POOR LITTLE GIRL WHAT DOES THE GOOD FOR NOTHING WANT IN THE PARLOUR SAID THEY
AND SAW A WHITE SNAKE LYING ON THE DISH BUT WHEN HE SAW IT HE COULD NOT DENY HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF TASTING IT SO HE CUT OF A LITTLE BIT AND PUT IT INTO HIS MOUTH NO SOONER HAD IT TOUCHED HIS TONGUE
INDICATED TO THE BOURGEOISIE A DIFFERENT LINE OF FUTURE EVENTS
ONLY WE'RE FEARED HER LADYSHIP MIGHT THINK IT RUDE
TO CLAPHAM JUNCTION THE FACE OF LONDON WAS GRIMY WITH POWDER OF THE BLACK SMOKE IN SPITE OF TWO DAYS OF THUNDERSTORMS AND RAIN AND AT CLAPHAM JUNCTION THE LINE HAD BEEN WRECKED AGAIN THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF OUT OF WORK CLERKS AND SHOPMEN
ON THE SECOND OF JULY CAME A CRISIS IN THE MINISTRY THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF WHICH WAS THE UKRAINIAN QUESTION
TO THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS AND MENSHEVIKI IN CONTROL OF THE SOVIET PARTIES
CONSIDERED THAT THE PRINCIPAL AIM HAD BEEN ATTAINED
BUT THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY THE DEMONSTRATION WAS LOST AS SOON AS IT WAS REPORTED FROM THE FRONT THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY HAD ADVANCED TO ATTACK THE ENEMY ON THE VERY DAY THAT THE WORKINGMEN AND THE PETROGRAD GARRISON DEMANDED THE PUBLICATION OF THE SECRET TREATIES
BEEN LOOKING AT THE CUTTER FATHER OH SHE DON'T WANT NO LOOKING AT WHO BROUGHT THOSE COWS DOWN HERE JEMMY DADD HE'S A FOOL WE SHALL BE HAVING SOME OF EM GOING OVER THE CLIFF
THE LAST REMARK CAME SO QUICKLY THAT THE HEARER STARTED AND MADE NO REPLY YOU SEE SIR RISDON WE MIGHT RUN THE CARGO AND STOW IT ALL UP AT MY PLACE FOR WE'VE PLENTY O ROOM
CLUNG TO A MIDDLE COURSE AND ONLY MUDDLED MATTERS THE MORE
IN A BROAD SKIRTED SHABBY BROWN VELVET COAT WHO WAS DAINTILY PICKING HIS WAY CANE IN HAND OVER THE SOFT TURF OF THE FIELD
AY TO BE SURE SAID SHACKLE
WHILE AMONG THE WORKINGMEN MUCH DISCONTENT HAD ACCUMULATED WHICH CRAVED FOR OUTWARD EXPRESSION AVAIL YOURSELVES OF THE RESIGNATIONS OF THE CADET MINISTERS
DON'T RAKE UP MY MISFORTUNES NOT I SIR RISDON I'M FULL O SORROW AND RESPECT FOR A NOBLE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS SUFFERED FOR THE CAUSE OF THE REAL KING WHO WHEN HE COMES WILL SET US ALL RIGHT
AFFILIATED WITH ENGLISH FRENCH AND AMERICAN IMPERIALISM AND THUS FREE THEM FROM THE NECESSITY OF RECKONING LATER WITH THE ORGANIZED WILL OF RUSSIAN DEMOCRACY THE SECRET COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY INSTIGATORS OF THE DRIVE
AND WE FRANKLY SAID SO SHOULD TAKE THE GOVERNING POWER INTO THEIR OWN HANDS BUT EVEN AFTER THE MINISTERIAL CRISIS OF THE SECOND OF JULY
THEY DID ALL THEY COULD TO DIVERT ME FROM THIS MORBIDITY BUT AT LAST I COULD RESIST THE IMPULSE NO LONGER AND PROMISING FAITHFULLY TO RETURN TO THEM AND PARTING AS I WILL CONFESS FROM THESE FOUR DAY FRIENDS WITH TEARS
THE NURSERY GROUNDS WERE EVERYWHERE CRIMSON WITH THE WEED
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN AND GO TO BED YOU SHAN'T HEAR ANYBODY COME OR GO AWAY AND YOU'RE NOT OBLIGED TO LOOK IN THE CELLARS FOR A FEW DAYS
AFTER ALL THE PRECEDING EXPERIENCE OF THE COALITION THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE BUT ONE WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY TO BREAK WITH THE CADETS AND SET UP A SOVIET GOVERNMENT THE RELATIVE FORCES WITHIN THE SOVIETS
WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE CUSTOMARY NAVVIES AND WE WERE JOLTED OVER A HASTY RELAYING ALL DOWN THE LINE FROM THERE THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS GAUNT AND UNFAMILIAR WIMBLEDON PARTICULARLY HAD SUFFERED
APPARENTLY THEY HAD LEARNED SOMETHING OF MY STORY FROM ME DURING THE DAYS OF MY LAPSE VERY GENTLY WHEN MY MIND WAS ASSURED AGAIN DID THEY BREAK TO ME WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED OF THE FATE OF LEATHERHEAD
AND THAT EVERY OTHER MAN STILL WORE HIS DIRTY RAGS THEIR FACES SEEMED ALL WITH ONE OF TWO EXPRESSIONS A LEAPING EXULTATION AND ENERGY OR A GRIM RESOLUTION SAVE FOR THE EXPRESSION OF THE FACES
THE SENTENCE ENDED ABRUPTLY I REMEMBERED MY INABILITY TO FIX MY MIND THAT MORNING SCARCELY A MONTH GONE BY AND HOW I HAD BROKEN OFF TO GET MY DAILY CHRONICLE FROM THE NEWSBOY I REMEMBERED HOW I WENT DOWN TO THE GARDEN GATE AS HE CAME ALONG
INCLUDING THE CALLING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WERE BEING POSTPONED THE INSOLVENCY AND THE INSTABILITY OF THE COALITION REGIME WERE OBVIOUS THERE WERE TWO POSSIBLE WAYS OUT
AT WATERLOO I FOUND THE FREE TRAINS THAT WERE TAKING PEOPLE TO THEIR HOMES THE FIRST RUSH WAS ALREADY OVER THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE IN THE TRAIN AND I WAS IN NO MOOD FOR CASUAL CONVERSATION I GOT A COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF
AND I WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU SIR RISDON THE GENTLEMAN STARTED NOT ABOUT
THE MECHANISM OF THE SOVIETS ASSURED A SUFFICIENTLY EXACT REFLECTION OF THE PROGRESSIVE SHIFT TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE MASSES OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS AFTER THE BREAK OF THE COALITION WITH THE BOURGEOISIE THE RADICAL TENDENCIES SHOULD WE EXPECTED
IN VIEW OF ITS GREAT HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE WE APPEND AN EXTRACT FROM THE DOCUMENT ISSUED BY OUR PARTY IN THE ALL RUSSIAN COUNCIL OF SOVIETS ON THE THIRD OF JUNE NINETEEN SEVENTEEN JUST TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE DRIVE
HOPE HE WON'T THEM CELLARS ARE TOO VALLYBLE HALLO WHAT NOW
THESE PEOPLE WHOSE NAME MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THEM I MAY NOT EVEN GIVE HERE NEVERTHELESS CUMBERED THEMSELVES WITH ME SHELTERED ME AND PROTECTED ME FROM MYSELF
THE LADS COULD RUN IT UP THE VALLEY AND DOWN INTO YOUR CELLAR SIR RISDON WHISPERED THE MAN AS IF AFRAID THAT THE OLD GREY HORSE WOULD HEAR NOBODY WOULD BE A BIT THE WISER AND YOU'D BE DOING A NEIGHBOUR A GOOD TURN
AND THEN A STRANGE THING OCCURRED IT IS NO USE SAID A VOICE THE HOUSE IS DESERTED NO ONE HAS BEEN HERE THESE TEN DAYS DO NOT STAY HERE TO TORMENT YOURSELF NO ONE ESCAPED BUT YOU
THAT IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT ANY GREAT PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION COULD HAVE BEEN SLAIN BUT THEN I NOTICED HOW YELLOW WERE THE SKINS OF THE PEOPLE I MET HOW SHAGGY THE HAIR OF THE MEN HOW LARGE AND BRIGHT THEIR EYES
YOU SEE THE REVENUE CUTTER'S HANGING ABOUT HERE A DEAL AND IT LOOKS BAD SURELY NO ONE WOULD BETRAY YOU MASTER SHACKLE HOPE NOT SIR RISDON
THE DRESSY YOUNG BLADE SAID IT WAS HER HUSBAND'S THAT PUT HER IN THAT EXPECTATION OR AT LEAST IT OUGHT TO BE UNLESS SHE WERE ANOTHER EPHESIAN MATRON I MUST ACQUAINT YOU SAID MISTER CROTTHERS CLAPPING ON THE TABLE SO AS TO EVOKE A RESONANT COMMENT OF EMPHASIS

UNHAPPY WOMAN SHE HAS BEEN TOO LONG AND TOO PERSISTENTLY DENIED HER LEGITIMATE PREROGATIVE TO LISTEN TO HIS OBJURGATIONS WITH ANY OTHER FEELING THAN THE DERISION OF THE DESPERATE HE SAYS THIS A CENSOR OF MORALS A VERY PELICAN IN HIS PIETY WHO DID NOT SCRUPLE

CRICKEY I'M ABOUT SPRUNG TARNALLY DOG GONE MY SHINS IF THIS BEENT THE BESTEST PUTTIEST LONGBREAK YET ITEM CURATE COUPLE OF COOKIES FOR THIS CHILD COT'S PLOOD AND PRANDYPALLS NONE NOT A PITE OF SHEESES
THE MYSTERY WAS UNVEILED HAINES WAS THE THIRD BROTHER HIS REAL NAME WAS CHILDS THE BLACK PANTHER WAS HIMSELF THE GHOST OF HIS OWN FATHER HE DRANK DRUGS TO OBLITERATE FOR THIS RELIEF MUCH THANKS THE LONELY HOUSE BY THE GRAVEYARD IS UNINHABITED NO SOUL WILL LIVE THERE
D'YE KEN BARE SOCKS SEEDY CUSS IN THE RICHMOND RAWTHERE THOUGHT HE HAD A DEPOSIT OF LEAD IN HIS PENIS TRUMPERY INSANITY BARTLE THE BREAD WE CALLS HIM THAT SIR WAS ONCE A PROSPEROUS CIT
YOURS AND MINE AND OF ALL FOR A BARE SHILLING AND HER LUCKPENNY TOGETHER THEY HEAR THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE WATCH AS TWO RAINCAPED SHADOWS PASS THE NEW ROYAL UNIVERSITY BRIDIE BRIDIE KELLY
IN THE QUESTION OF THE GRAZING LANDS HIS PEEVISH ASPERITY IS NOTORIOUS
AND HOW I AM PUNISHED THE INFERNO HAS NO TERRORS FOR ME THIS IS THE APPEARANCE IS ON ME TARE AND AGES WHAT WAY WOULD I BE RESTING AT ALL HE MUTTERED THICKLY
HE CONJURED UP THE SCENE BEFORE THEM THE SECRET PANEL BESIDE THE CHIMNEY SLID BACK AND IN THE RECESS APPEARED HAINES WHICH OF US DID NOT FEEL HIS FLESH CREEP
AND THAT AS THE PRECURSOR OF THE TEAM OF HORSES IN THE COURT YARD SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD NOT BE EQUAL TO A LESSON OF THIS TAO WHICH ONE MIGHT PRESENT ON HIS KNEES
A SKILFUL COMMANDER STRIKES A DECISIVE BLOW AND STOPS HE DOES NOT DARE BY CONTINUING HIS OPERATIONS TO ASSERT AND COMPLETE HIS MASTERY HE WILL STRIKE THE BLOW
WHAT SPACE THE GULF BETWEEN SHALL FILL WHAT ALL MEN FEAR IS INDEED TO BE FEARED BUT HOW WIDE AND WITHOUT END IS THE RANGE OF QUESTIONS ASKING TO BE DISCUSSED
I WILL TAKE NO TROUBLE ABOUT IT AND THE PEOPLE WILL OF THEMSELVES BECOME RICH I WILL MANIFEST NO AMBITION AND THE PEOPLE WILL OF THEMSELVES ATTAIN TO THE PRIMITIVE SIMPLICITY
THE SOFT OVERCOMES THE HARD AND THE WEAK THE STRONG
THERE WAS SOMETHING UNDEFINED AND COMPLETE COMING INTO EXISTENCE BEFORE HEAVEN AND EARTH HOW STILL IT WAS AND FORMLESS STANDING ALONE AND UNDERGOING NO CHANGE REACHING EVERYWHERE AND IN NO DANGER OF BEING EXHAUSTED
MUSIC AND DAINTIES WILL MAKE THE PASSING GUEST STOP FOR A TIME BUT THOUGH THE TAO AS IT COMES FROM THE MOUTH SEEMS INSIPID AND HAS NO FLAVOUR THOUGH IT SEEMS NOT WORTH BEING LOOKED AT OR LISTENED TO
NOW ARMS HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL ARE INSTRUMENTS OF EVIL OMEN HATEFUL IT MAY BE SAID TO ALL CREATURES THEREFORE THEY WHO HAVE THE TAO DO NOT LIKE TO EMPLOY THEM
FROM SELF BOASTING AND THEREFORE HIS MERIT IS ACKNOWLEDGED FROM SELF COMPLACENCY AND THEREFORE HE ACQUIRES SUPERIORITY IT IS BECAUSE HE IS THUS FREE FROM STRIVING THAT THEREFORE NO ONE IN THE WORLD IS ABLE TO STRIVE WITH HIM
HE WHO LIGHTLY PROMISES IS SURE TO KEEP BUT LITTLE FAITH HE WHO IS CONTINUALLY THINKING THINGS EASY IS SURE TO FIND THEM DIFFICULT
ITS ADMIRABLE WORDS CAN PURCHASE HONOUR ITS ADMIRABLE DEEDS CAN RAISE THEIR PERFORMER ABOVE OTHERS EVEN MEN WHO ARE NOT GOOD ARE NOT ABANDONED BY IT
HE MAY BE THE RULER OF A STATE
IT IS THE WAY OF THE TAO TO ACT WITHOUT THINKING OF ACTING TO CONDUCT AFFAIRS WITHOUT FEELING THE TROUBLE OF THEM TO TASTE WITHOUT DISCERNING ANY FLAVOUR TO CONSIDER WHAT IS SMALL AS GREAT AND A FEW AS MANY
THE GREAT STATE ONLY WISHES TO UNITE MEN TOGETHER AND NOURISH THEM A SMALL STATE ONLY WISHES TO BE RECEIVED BY AND TO SERVE THE OTHER EACH GETS WHAT IT DESIRES BUT THE GREAT STATE MUST LEARN TO ABASE ITSELF
AND TO RECOMPENSE INJURY WITH KINDNESS
WHERE THE MIND MAKES THE VITAL BREATH TO BURN FALSE IS THE STRENGTH AND O'ER IT WE SHOULD MOURN
THE STORE IN RUINS MOCKS OUR TOIL HENCE THE SAGE PUTS AWAY EXCESSIVE EFFORT EXTRAVAGANCE AND EASY INDULGENCE
HE WHO POSSESSES THE MOTHER OF THE STATE MAY CONTINUE LONG HIS CASE IS LIKE THAT OF THE PLANT OF WHICH WE SAY THAT ITS ROOTS ARE DEEP AND ITS FLOWER STALKS FIRM THIS IS THE WAY TO SECURE THAT ITS ENDURING LIFE SHALL LONG BE SEEN
IT IS ONLY BY THIS MODERATION THAT THERE IS EFFECTED AN EARLY RETURN TO MAN'S NORMAL STATE THAT EARLY RETURN IS WHAT I CALL THE REPEATED ACCUMULATION OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE TAO
GOVERNING A GREAT STATE IS LIKE COOKING SMALL FISH
ALL THINGS DEPEND ON IT FOR THEIR PRODUCTION WHICH IT GIVES TO THEM NOT ONE REFUSING OBEDIENCE TO IT WHEN ITS WORK IS ACCOMPLISHED IT DOES NOT CLAIM THE NAME OF HAVING DONE IT IT CLOTHES ALL THINGS AS WITH A GARMENT
ALL WOULD SPONTANEOUSLY SUBMIT THEMSELVES TO HIM
TO HIM BY WHOM THIS HARMONY IS KNOWN THE SECRET OF THE UNCHANGING TAO IS SHOWN AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE WISDOM FINDS ITS THRONE ALL LIFE INCREASING ARTS TO EVIL TURN
I AM LIKE AN INFANT WHICH HAS NOT YET SMILED
AND MAKES NO ASSUMPTION OF BEING THEIR LORD IT MAY BE NAMED IN THE SMALLEST THINGS ALL THINGS RETURN TO THEIR ROOT AND DISAPPEAR AND DO NOT KNOW THAT IT IS IT WHICH PRESIDES OVER THEIR DOING SO IT MAY BE NAMED IN THE GREATEST THINGS
AS SOON AS IT PROCEEDS TO ACTION IT HAS A NAME WHEN IT ONCE HAS THAT NAME MEN CAN KNOW TO REST IN IT WHEN THEY KNOW TO REST IN IT THEY CAN BE FREE FROM ALL RISK OF FAILURE AND ERROR
THEREFORE WHEN ONE IS MAKING THE TAO HIS BUSINESS THOSE WHO ARE ALSO PURSUING IT AGREE WITH HIM IN IT AND THOSE WHO ARE MAKING THE MANIFESTATION OF ITS COURSE THEIR OBJECT AGREE WITH HIM IN THAT
IT MAY BE REGARDED AS THE MOTHER OF ALL THINGS
THIS IS THE REASON WHY ALL UNDER HEAVEN CONSIDER IT THE MOST VALUABLE THING
WHEN THINGS HAVE ATTAINED THEIR STRONG MATURITY THEY BECOME OLD THIS MAY BE SAID TO BE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TAO AND WHAT IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT SOON COMES TO AN END
HOW SHOULD THE LORD OF A MYRIAD CHARIOTS CARRY HIMSELF LIGHTLY BEFORE THE KINGDOM IF HE DO ACT LIGHTLY HE HAS LOST HIS ROOT OF GRAVITY IF HE PROCEED TO ACTIVE MOVEMENT HE WILL LOSE HIS THRONE
WHEN ONE IS ABOUT TO TAKE AN INSPIRATION HE IS SURE TO MAKE A PREVIOUS EXPIRATION WHEN HE IS GOING TO WEAKEN ANOTHER HE WILL FIRST STRENGTHEN HIM WHEN HE IS GOING TO OVERTHROW ANOTHER HE WILL FIRST HAVE RAISED HIM UP
WHAT MAKES A GREAT STATE IS ITS BEING LIKE A LOW LYING DOWN FLOWING STREAM IT BECOMES THE CENTRE TO WHICH TEND ALL THE SMALL STATES UNDER HEAVEN
SHOWING THE PERFECTION OF ITS PHYSICAL ESSENCE ALL DAY LONG IT WILL CRY WITHOUT ITS THROAT BECOMING HOARSE SHOWING THE HARMONY IN ITS CONSTITUTION
THE MOONLIGHT SHONE ON THE WHITE STONES BRINGING THEM OUT IN CLEAR CUT RELIEF AGAINST THE DARK TREES BEHIND HOW STRANGE THE GRAVEYARD LOOKS BY MOONLIGHT SAID RUBY SUDDENLY HOW GHOSTLY SHE SHUDDERED ANNE
NEVER SAW A HAPPIER MARRIAGE IT STRUCK ME THAT HELEN LOOKED A TRIFLE BLEAK AND I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED ALL THAT GOSSIP THAT MARTY KEENE TOLD US LAST SUMMER SO I HASTILY CHANGED THE CONVERSATION TO A PERFECTLY SAFE SUBJECT LIKE ORPHANS
I SUGGESTED A CHANGE AND SENT HIM HOME WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN BUT HE BROUGHT IT BACK IN A FEW DAYS AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND YOU'LL COME UP AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN WON'T YOU ANNE
THE TRUSTEES MEETING LAST WEEK WENT BEAUTIFULLY THE NEW WOMEN ARE MOST HELPFUL AND ONLY THE NICE MEN CAME I AM HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE HON CY WYKOFF IS VISITING HIS MARRIED DAUGHTER IN SCRANTON I WISH SHE WOULD INVITE FATHER TO LIVE WITH HER PERMANENTLY
MERCY
I HAD HOPED THOSE TWO INTELLIGENT SPINSTERS WOULD SEE THEIR WAY TO KEEPING HIM FOREVER
PLEASING VISIONS WERE ALSO BEING WOVEN AROUND PATTY'S PLACE THERE WAS A WARM PLEASANT SENSE OF HOME IN THE THOUGHT OF IT EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER LIVED THERE BUT THE SUMMER HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY ONE TOO A TIME OF GLAD LIVING WITH SUMMER SUNS AND SKIES A TIME OF KEEN DELIGHT IN WHOLESOME THINGS
HAVE A GOOD TIME AND DON'T FORGET THE JOHN GRIER HOME AND SALLIE DECEMBER ELEVENTH DEAR JUDY YOUR JAMAICA LETTER IS HERE AND I'M GLAD TO LEARN THAT JUDY JUNIOR ENJOYS TRAVELING
THE BOYS HAVE SPENT THE MORNING IN THE WOODS GATHERING EVERGREENS AND DRAWING THEM HOME ON SLEDS AND TWENTY GIRLS ARE SPENDING THE AFTERNOON IN THE LAUNDRY
MEN ARE SO GOOD AT TALKING GOOD BY AND A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO JERVIS AND BOTH JUDIES S MC B
WON'T YOU PLEASE EXPUNGE THAT UNFORTUNATE FIFTEEN MINUTES AT THE PORTE COCHERE LAST JUNE AND REMEMBER INSTEAD THE FIFTEEN HOURS I SPENT READING THE KALLIKAK FAMILY
WHICH I DID NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE MEAN AND FROM THEN ON YOU FADED INTO THE DISTANCE REALLY I HAVE FELT TERRIBLY BAD ABOUT IT AND HAVE WANTED TO APOLOGIZE BUT YOUR MANNER HAS NOT BEEN INVITING OF CONFIDENCE
ALL THE TIME I'M WITH HER I FEEL AS IF I WERE WATCHING HER STRUGGLE WITH AN INVISIBLE FOE TRYING TO PUSH IT BACK WITH SUCH FEEBLE RESISTANCE AS SHE HAS THAT IS WHY I COME HOME TIRED
AND AFTER LUNCHEON THEY VISITED THE AQUARIUM AND THE TOP OF THE SINGER BUILDING AND TOOK THE SUBWAY UPTOWN TO SPEND AN HOUR WITH THE BIRDS OF AMERICA IN THEIR HABITATS SANDY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PRIED THEM AWAY FROM THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM IN TIME TO CATCH THE SIX FIFTEEN TRAIN
PARTLY BECAUSE I WANTED TO JUSTIFY THEIR JUDGMENT PARTLY BECAUSE I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN GIVING THE POOR LITTLE KIDDIES THEIR SHARE OF HAPPINESS BUT MOSTLY I ACTUALLY BELIEVE
BUT AT LEAST COMPARED WITH STERRY TURNFELT IS A SCHOLARD AND SPEAKING OF STERRY HE PAID US A SOCIAL CALL A FEW DAYS AGO IN QUITE A CHASTENED FRAME OF MIND IT SEEMS THAT THE RICH CITY FELLER WHOSE ESTATE HE HAS BEEN MANAGING NO LONGER NEEDS HIS SERVICES
DEATH JUST CAME AND STARED ME IN THE FACE UNTIL I GOT SO FRIGHTENED
THE TWO BUILDING DETAILS WE DID ACCOMPLISH ARE VERY PROMISING OUR NEW LAUNDRY GROWS BETTER AND BETTER
ALWAYS CHATTERING AND WHISPERING OF HER BEAUX AND THEIR RIVALRIES AND DESPAIRS IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ANNE'S VISITS HARD FOR HER WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SILLY OR AMUSING WAS GRUESOME NOW IT WAS DEATH PEERING THROUGH A WILFUL MASK OF LIFE
MY DESK AND CLOSET AND BUREAU DRAWERS ARE ORGANIZED TO SUIT ME
I DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID ANNE BLANKLY DIANA CLAPPED HER HANDS
DINNER IN THE DINING CAR THEY INQUIRED WITH GREAT PARTICULARITY HOW MUCH IT WAS COSTING AND WHEN THEY HEARD THAT IT WAS THE SAME NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU ATE THEY DREW DEEP BREATHS AND SETTLED QUIETLY AND STEADILY TO THE TASK OF NOT ALLOWING THEIR HOST TO BE CHEATED
AND CERTAINLY I AM NOT DOING IT TO FIND MY LIFE WORK
DEAR RUBY I KNOW EVERYBODY KNOWS IT SAID RUBY BITTERLY
BUT WHEN I DO I SETTLE WORLD PROBLEMS
HE PAUSED IN PASSING TO MAKE A POLITE COMMENT UPON THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE WEATHER AND TO EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT I WOULD REMEMBER HIM TO MISSUS PENDLETON WHEN I WROTE
BUT YOU WON'T BE FRIGHTENED ANY MORE RUBY WILL YOU
AND DEEP WOMANHOOD JOYS MIGHT HAVE DONE FOR RUBY ANNE LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A MIST OF TEARS AT HER OLD PLAYFELLOW THOUGHT SHE SAW THE FACE GOD HAD MEANT RUBY TO HAVE AND REMEMBERED IT SO ALWAYS
THANKING YOU FOR THE INTEREST YOU HAVE SHOWN IN OUR ENTERPRISE WE REMAIN YOURS VERY TRULY
WITH CHRISTMAS ONLY A WEEK AWAY HOWEVER SHALL WE FINISH ALL OUR PLANS IN A WEEK THE CHICKS ARE MAKING PRESENTS FOR ONE ANOTHER AND SOMETHING LIKE A THOUSAND SECRETS HAVE BEEN WHISPERED IN MY EAR SNOW LAST NIGHT
CAME TOO AND WE HAD A LITTLE PARTY THE WOMAN SEEMED TO FEEL THAT THE BURDEN OF ENTERTAINMENT RESTED UPON HER AND BY WAY OF MAKING CONVERSATION SHE TOLD US THAT HER HUSBAND HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL WHO SOLD TICKETS AT A MOVING PICTURE SHOW
NOTHING SEEMS QUITE SO DREADFUL NOW GOOD NIGHT ANNE GOOD NIGHT DEAR
ANNE INSTANTLY MANUFACTURED A SMILE AND PUT IT ON OF COURSE I COULDN'T BE ANYTHING BUT PLEASED OVER YOUR UNSELFISH WISH TO GIVE ME PLEASURE SHE SAID SLOWLY BUT YOU KNOW I'M SO AMAZED I CAN'T REALIZE IT
DEVIL FISH AND SKY SCRAPERS AND BIRDS OF PARADISE
I SUPPOSE JUDGING FROM THE THEATERS THIS WINTER
ANNE PUZZLED OPENED THE LETTER AND GLANCED OVER THE TYPEWRITTEN CONTENTS MISS ANNE SHIRLEY GREEN GABLES AVONLEA P E ISLAND DEAR MADAM
WHEN HE FIRST CAME I MADE HIM FREE OF THE LIBRARY HE BEGAN AT THE CASE NEAREST THE DOOR WHICH CONTAINS THIRTY SEVEN VOLUMES OF PANSY'S WORKS
IN WHICH WE WILL NEVER USE ANY BAKING POWDER EXCEPT ROLLINGS RELIABLE OH GASPED POOR ANNE
ISN'T IT FUNNY YOU'D THINK I MUST HAVE A DASH OF CREOLE OR SPANISH OR SOME WARM BLOOD IN ME SOMEWHERE BUT I'M NOTHING ON EARTH BUT A CHILLY MIXTURE OF ENGLISH AND IRISH AND SCOTCH
HE WAVED ME ASIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE AND GROWLINGLY ASKED MISS SNAITH IF SHE COULDN'T ECONOMIZE A LITTLE ON CARBOLIC ACID THE HOUSE SMELT LIKE A HOSPITAL I MUST TELL YOU THAT PUNCH IS BACK WITH US AGAIN ENTIRELY RENOVATED AS TO MANNERS I AM LOOKING FOR A FAMILY TO ADOPT HIM
GREATER NATURE COVERS ALL HER WORKS WITH A VARNISH OF BEAUTY LIKE THE TENDER BLOOM THAT IS BREATHED AS IT WERE ON THE SURFACE OF A PEACH OR A PLUM
THE FLY SHOULD BE USED AS THE SYMBOL OF IMPERTINENCE AND AUDACITY FOR WHILST ALL OTHER ANIMALS SHUN MAN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND RUN AWAY
OR DOTH IT SIT BEHIND A BIG STONE AND CATCH FLIES AND VERILY I AM WELL DISPOSED TO MINE ETERNAL FATE BECAUSE IT DOTH NOT HOUND AND HURRY ME BUT LEAVETH ME TIME FOR MERRIMENT AND MISCHIEF
NOT EVEN THOSE VERY THINGS WHICH ARISE ONLY WHEN NEED AND WANT ARE FOR A MOMENT LOST SIGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE TRUE SOUGHT FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
BUT IN TWO ENTIRELY OPPOSITE WAYS ACCORDING AS IT IS HIS PHYSICAL OR HIS MENTAL STATURE THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE ONE WILL SEEM SMALLER THE FARTHER OFF YOU MOVE THE OTHER
AS IT HAPPENETH WITH ME SO IS IT WITH ALL FRUITS THAT TURN RIPE IT IS THE HONEY IN MY VEINS THAT MAKETH MY BLOOD THICKER AND ALSO MY SOUL STILLER
EVEN NOW A CHILD OF NATURE SOMETIMES SEES THEM SOME ONE WHO HAS NOT ANTICIPATED HIS AESTHETIC PLEASURES BY THE HELP OF ART OR TAKEN THE CHARMS OF LIFE TOO EARLY
AND TO DAY ONE SEETH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN EVER YEA MINE ANIMALS ANSWERED HE YE COUNSEL ADMIRABLY AND ACCORDING TO MY HEART I WILL TO DAY ASCEND A HIGH MOUNTAIN
THEN HE DISPOSES ALL THINGS BY THE AGENCY OF GOOD IF IT BE TRUE THAT HE RULES ALL THINGS BY HIS OWN POWER WHOM WE HAVE AGREED TO BE GOOD AND HE IS AS IT WERE THE RUDDER AND HELM BY WHICH THE WORLD'S MECHANISM IS KEPT STEADY AND IN ORDER
IN THE SAME WAY THE NEED OF SOCIETY DRIVES THE HUMAN PORCUPINES TOGETHER ONLY TO BE MUTUALLY REPELLED BY THE MANY PRICKLY AND DISAGREEABLE QUALITIES OF THEIR NATURE
NOT THAT I WOULD HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST SUCH WRATHFUL ONES ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY ARE WELL ENOUGH FOR LAUGHTER TO ME IMPATIENT MUST THEY NOW BE THOSE BIG ALARM DRUMS WHICH FIND A VOICE NOW OR NEVER
AND THE MANY AND IF IN THE END HE LOSES ALL PATIENCE HE CRUSHES BOTH THEM AND HIMSELF OR HE IS LIKE GULLIVER AT LILLIPUT
POETRY AND ART WHICH IN CIVIC LIFE SO SEVERE BUT STILL USEFUL AND NOT WITHOUT ITS FRUIT PLAY THE SAME PART AS FLOWERS IN THE CORN
PREFERS TO REMAIN OUTSIDE WHERE HE WILL NEITHER PRICK OTHER PEOPLE
ITS COLOR AND PERFUME ARE DELIGHTFUL BUT IT WITHERS AWAY AND LEAVES NO SEED NO ROSE WITHOUT A THORN YES BUT MANY A THORN WITHOUT A ROSE
BUT WHEN WINTER COMES YOU WILL BE BARED OF YOUR GLORY AND I SHALL BE AS I AM NOW ONCE AS I WAS BOTANIZING UNDER AN OAK
HE WILL NEED NO EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE RULING OF THE WORLD OTHERWISE IF HE STANDS IN NEED OF AUGHT HE WILL NOT POSSESS COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE THAT IS NECESSARILY SO SAID I THEN
THERE ARE SOME REALLY BEAUTIFULLY LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD BUT THE HUMAN FIGURES IN THEM ARE POOR AND YOU HAD NOT BETTER LOOK AT THEM
YE WAGS ANSWERED ZARATHUSTRA AND SMILED HOW WELL DID YE CHOOSE THE SIMILE BUT YE KNOW ALSO THAT MY HAPPINESS IS HEAVY
TAKES VERY DIFFERENT SHAPES ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AT BOTTOM HE IS A MAN WHO CARES NOTHING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND ONLY STRIVES TO GAIN THE SEMBLANCE OF IT THAT HE MAY USE IT FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL ENDS
UNTIL BITING AT MY SHARP HIDDEN HOOKS THEY HAVE TO COME UP UNTO MY HEIGHT THE MOTLEYEST ABYSS GROUNDLINGS TO THE WICKEDEST OF ALL FISHERS OF MEN
SINCE GOD IS RIGHTLY BELIEVED TO GOVERN ALL THINGS WITH THE RUDDER OF GOODNESS AND SINCE ALL THINGS DO LIKEWISE AS I HAVE TAUGHT HASTE TOWARDS GOOD BY THE VERY AIM OF NATURE CAN IT BE DOUBTED THAT HIS GOVERNANCE IS WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
ONE OF THEM DID NOTHING BUT STUDY THE MACHINERY AND HE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT HOW IT WAS WORKED THE OTHER TRIED TO GET AT THE MEANING OF THE PIECE IN SPITE OF HIS IGNORANCE OF THE LANGUAGE HERE
THEN AFTER THROUGH THE STRESS OF HEAVY GRIEF THEN SHE CONTINUED IF THOU WILT REFLECT UPON THY FORMER ADMISSIONS IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE THOU DOST ALSO RECOLLECT THAT OF WHICH
EVERY ONE OF THEM ALIKE STANDING THERE SO ERECT AND BEARING THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE EAR
AND GENERALLY TO AFFORD HELP TO THOSE INTELLECTUAL EFFORTS WHICH ENNOBLE THE RACE WHEREVER THESE INSTITUTIONS MAY BE
FOR SUCH IS THE FORM OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE THAT NEITHER CAN IT PASS INTO THINGS EXTERNAL NOR TAKE UP ANYTHING EXTERNAL INTO ITSELF BUT AS PARMENIDES SAYS OF IT
I DO NOT THINK IT DOUBTFUL NOW NOR SHALL I EVER AND BY WHAT REASONS I AM BROUGHT TO THIS ASSURANCE I WILL BRIEFLY SET FORTH
SO WILL IT BE O ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED HIS ANIMALS AND PRESSED UP TO HIM BUT WILT THOU NOT TO DAY ASCEND A HIGH MOUNTAIN THE AIR IS PURE
THE PETITION TOO FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE YOUNG LADY'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE HAD ALREADY BEEN DESPATCHED AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A PRETEXT FOR ABRUPTLY DISMISSING HER AND AS IF ALL THINGS CONSPIRED IN FAVOUR OF THE GENTLE REBECCA THE VERY ELEMENTS
MISSUS SEDLEY TOOK HER HUSBAND TO TASK FOR HIS CRUEL CONDUCT TO POOR JOE IT WAS QUITE WICKED OF YOU MISTER SEDLEY SAID SHE TO TORMENT THE POOR BOY SO MY DEAR SAID THE COTTON TASSEL IN DEFENCE OF HIS CONDUCT
A WOMAN WITH FAIR OPPORTUNITIES AND WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTE HUMP MAY MARRY WHOM SHE LIKES ONLY LET US BE THANKFUL THAT THE DARLINGS ARE LIKE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD AND DON'T KNOW THEIR OWN POWER THEY WOULD OVERCOME US ENTIRELY IF THEY DID
NO SAID SHE I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T AND THEN SHE GAVE HIM EVER SO GENTLE A PRESSURE WITH HER LITTLE HAND AND DREW IT BACK QUITE FRIGHTENED AND LOOKED FIRST FOR ONE INSTANT IN HIS FACE AND THEN DOWN AT THE CARPET RODS
IT IS WHAT SENTIMENTALISTS WHO DEAL IN VERY BIG WORDS CALL A YEARNING AFTER THE IDEAL AND SIMPLY MEANS THAT WOMEN ARE COMMONLY NOT SATISFIED UNTIL THEY HAVE HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN ON WHOM THEY MAY CENTRE AFFECTIONS WHICH ARE SPENT ELSEWHERE AS IT WERE
HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HER IN AN IMPLORING ATTITUDE AND HIS HANDS BOUND IN A WEB OF GREEN SILK WHICH SHE WAS UNWINDING IN THIS ROMANTIC POSITION OSBORNE AND AMELIA FOUND THE INTERESTING PAIR
BLUSHED AS ONLY YOUNG LADIES OF SEVENTEEN KNOW HOW TO BLUSH
QUITE READY TO KISS HER BROTHER IF HE WERE SO MINDED AND I THINK FOR A KISS FROM SUCH A DEAR CREATURE AS AMELIA I WOULD PURCHASE ALL MISTER LEE'S CONSERVATORIES OUT OF HAND O HEAVENLY HEAVENLY FLOWERS EXCLAIMED MISS SHARP
NOTHING COULD INDUCE HER FRIEND TO GO WITHOUT HER WHAT YOU WHO HAVE SHOWN THE POOR ORPHAN WHAT HAPPINESS AND LOVE ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE QUIT YOU NEVER AND THE GREEN EYES LOOKED UP TO HEAVEN AND FILLED WITH TEARS
YET SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SUPPOSE THAT THE LITTLE HUMBLE GRATEFUL GENTLE GOVERNESS WOULD DARE TO LOOK UP TO SUCH A MAGNIFICENT PERSONAGE AS THE COLLECTOR OF BOGGLEY WOLLAH
OR WERE REPLACED BY THE GENTLE BUT UNROMANTIC MUSIC OF THE NOSE AND SAVE WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS TOLLED THE HOUR AND THE WATCHMAN CALLED IT ALL WAS SILENT AT THE HOUSE OF JOHN SEDLEY ESQUIRE OF RUSSELL SQUARE AND THE STOCK EXCHANGE
AND BEARING TWO HANDSOME NOSEGAYS OF FLOWERS WHICH THE MONSTER HAD ACTUALLY HAD THE GALLANTRY TO PURCHASE IN COVENT GARDEN MARKET THAT MORNING THEY WERE NOT AS BIG AS THE HAYSTACKS WHICH LADIES CARRY ABOUT WITH THEM NOW A DAYS IN CONES OF FILIGREE PAPER
JOS IS A GREAT DEAL VAINER THAN YOU EVER WERE IN YOUR LIFE AND THAT'S SAYING A GOOD DEAL THOUGH SOME THIRTY YEARS AGO IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WHAT WAS IT PERHAPS YOU HAD A RIGHT TO BE VAIN I DON'T SAY NO
BUT THERE WAS NO LETTER DO THEY TALK THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS AT BOGGLEY WOLLAH SEDLEY ASKED OSBORNE LAUGHING POOH NONSENSE REPLIED THE SENTIMENTAL YOUTH BOUGHT EM AT NATHAN'S VERY GLAD YOU LIKE EM
OVER AGAIN AS SHE CAME TO THE LAST WORDS MISS SHARP'S DEEP TONED VOICE FALTERED EVERYBODY FELT THE ALLUSION TO HER DEPARTURE AND TO HER HAPLESS ORPHAN STATE JOSEPH SEDLEY WHO WAS FOND OF MUSIC AND SOFT HEARTED
AND WHAT A SENSATION SHE WOULD MAKE AT THE CALCUTTA BALLS IT'S EVIDENT THE POOR DEVIL'S IN LOVE WITH ME THOUGHT HE SHE IS JUST AS RICH AS MOST OF THE GIRLS WHO COME OUT TO INDIA
KNOWING GLANCES WERE TELEGRAPHED BETWEEN OSBORNE AND MISS SEDLEY AND THE PAIR SMILING ARCHLY LOOKED AT REBECCA WHO ACTUALLY BLUSHED AS SHE BENT HER FAIR RINGLETS OVER HER KNITTING HOW HER HEART BEAT AS JOSEPH APPEARED
SHE WAS ALL RESPECTFUL GRATITUDE TO MISSUS SEDLEY DELIGHTED BEYOND MEASURE AT THE BAZAARS AND IN A WHIRL OF WONDER AT THE THEATRE WHITHER THE GOOD NATURED LADY TOOK HER ONE DAY AMELIA HAD A HEADACHE AND COULD NOT GO UPON SOME PARTY OF PLEASURE TO WHICH THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WERE INVITED
THE SWEETEST SMILE POSSIBLE TAKING GOOD NATURED MISSUS SEDLEY'S EXTENDED HAND AND KISSING IT RESPECTFULLY HOW KIND YOU ALL ARE TO ME ALL SHE ADDED WITH A LAUGH EXCEPT YOU MISTER JOSEPH ME SAID JOSEPH MEDITATING AN INSTANT DEPARTURE
HOW DELIGHTED MISS REBECCA WAS AT THE GOVERNMENT BALLS AND HOW SHE LAUGHED AT THE STORIES OF THE SCOTCH AIDES DE CAMP AND CALLED MISTER SEDLEY A SAD WICKED SATIRICAL CREATURE AND HOW FRIGHTENED SHE WAS AT THE STORY OF THE ELEPHANT
WHEN THEY ENTERED TO ANNOUNCE THAT TIFFIN WAS READY THE SKEIN OF SILK WAS JUST WOUND ROUND THE CARD BUT MISTER JOS HAD NEVER SPOKEN I AM SURE HE WILL TO NIGHT DEAR AMELIA SAID AS SHE PRESSED REBECCA'S HAND
THOSE TWO HAVE TOLD THEIRS AS SOON AS HE GETS HIS COMPANY SAID JOSEPH I BELIEVE THE AFFAIR IS SETTLED GEORGE OSBORNE IS A CAPITAL FELLOW AND YOUR SISTER THE DEAREST CREATURE IN THE WORLD SAID REBECCA
AMELIA HASTENED AFTER HER FRIEND TO KNOW THE CAUSE OF THIS DISPLAY OF FEELING AND THE GOOD NATURED GIRL CAME BACK WITHOUT HER COMPANION RATHER AFFECTED TOO YOU KNOW HER FATHER WAS OUR DRAWING MASTER MAMMA AT CHISWICK AND USED TO DO ALL THE BEST PARTS OF OUR DRAWINGS
THAT EVERYBODY FELT HOW CRUEL HER LOT WAS AND HOW SORRY THEY WOULD BE TO PART WITH HER O THAT YOU COULD STAY LONGER DEAR REBECCA SAID AMELIA WHY ANSWERED THE OTHER STILL MORE SADLY
AND THE TWO ACCORDINGLY FOLLOWED MISTER JOSEPH REBECCA SANG FAR BETTER THAN HER FRIEND THOUGH OF COURSE OSBORNE WAS FREE TO KEEP HIS OPINION AND EXERTED HERSELF TO THE UTMOST AND INDEED TO THE WONDER OF AMELIA
AND THAT NIGHT IN A CONVERSATION WHICH TOOK PLACE IN A FRONT ROOM IN THE SECOND FLOOR IN A SORT OF TENT HUNG ROUND WITH CHINTZ OF A RICH AND FANTASTIC INDIA PATTERN AND DOUBLE WITH CALICO OF A TENDER ROSE COLOUR
THOU MEANS IT WHAT I MEAN I MUST HAVE A HUNDRED POUNDS
THERE OUGHT TO BE A SETTLEMENT ON YOU STILL IF YOUR FATHER SAYS NOTHING IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING FATHER WILL SAY NOTHING NOW SHE SAID YOU'VE NEVER SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN IT HENRY
HE QUESTIONED SAVAGELY I MUST BUY THINGS FOR THE WEDDING CLOTHES AND THINGS FATHER AY CLOTHES CLOTHES WHAT CLOTHES DOST WANT A FEW POUNDS WILL COVER THEM THERE'LL BE ALL THE LINEN FOR THE HOUSE
BUT SHE NEVER SLEPT WITHOUT THINKING OF WILLIE PRICE AND HOPING THAT NO FURTHER DISASTER MIGHT OVERTAKE HIM THE INCIDENT OF THE EMBEZZLED FIFTY POUNDS HAD BEEN CLOSED
BUT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS SHE HURRIED BACK BREATHLESS TO HER PLACE SEE THAT ANNA IT WILL BE RECKONED IN OUR RETURNS SHE SAID EXHIBITING A PIECE OF PAPER
IT WAS A COLD NIGHT IN NOVEMBER YET THE MISER WRATHFULLY SULLEN CHOSE TO SIT IN HIS OFFICE WITHOUT A FIRE AGNES WAS WORKING SUMS IN THE KITCHEN HENRY ANNA BEGAN
DRAPED AND FRILLED AND FLORIATED AND STILL LADEN WITH COUNTLESS ARTICLES OF USE AND ORNAMENT WERE CONTINUALLY REINFORCED WITH PURCHASERS BY EMISSARIES CANVASSING THE CROWD
THAT WILLIE A SELF CONVICTED FORGER HAD BEEN A PARTY TO THE EMBEZZLEMENT BUT ANNA KNEW THAT IT COULD NOT BE SO
IS THE RICHER BY A HUNDRED POUNDS UNCLAIMED AND THE WORLD THE POORER BY A SIMPLE AND MEEK SOUL STUNG TO REVOLT
SURELY NOT HE PROTESTED FORMALLY THAT'S WHAT FATHER TOLD ME AND HE MADE ME READ A LIST OF SHARES AND SO ON
TWO HUNDRED POUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF FURNITURE FOR THE PRIORY A MODEST SUM BUT HE JUDGED IT SUFFICIENT HIS METHOD WAS TO BUY A PIECE AT A TIME ALWAYS SECOND HAND BUT ALWAYS GOOD
HE WAS IN NO HURRY TO ENLARGE HIS BORDERS HE KNEW THAT THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN EVERY DAY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS IN EVERY YEAR AND THIRTY GOOD YEARS IN LIFE STILL LEFT TO HIM AND THEREFORE
THE NEXT MORNING AT HALF PAST SEVEN ANNA WAS STANDING IN THE GARDEN DOORWAY OF THE PRIORY THE SUN HAD JUST RISEN THE AIR WAS COLD ROOF AND PAVEMENT WERE DAMP
ANNA WENT STRAIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD TO HER FATHER AND ASKED HIM FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS OF HER OWN MONEY SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN TO HIM SAVE UNDER NECESSITY SINCE THE EVENING SPENT AT THE SUTTONS WHAT'S AFOOT NOW
THERE WAS NO QUIET ANYWHERE SAVE IN THE FARTHEST RECESS OF EACH STALL WHERE THE LADY IN SUPREME CHARGE OF IT LIKE A SPIDER IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS WEB WATCHED CUSTOMERS AND CASH BOX WITH EQUAL CUPIDITY
WHAT HE HAD LEARNT IN THAT INSTANT CAN ONLY BE GUESSED FROM HIS NEXT ACTION ANNA RAN OUT OF THE GARDEN INTO THE STREET AND SO HOME NEVER LOOKING BEHIND TO SEE IF HE PURSUED HIS WAY
HERE HE SAID SCORNFULLY TAK THY TRAPS AND NE'ER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN I WASH MY HANDS OF YE TAK EM AND DO WHAT YE'N A MIND CHUCK THY MONEY
OF THE TOWN HALL KEEPER NO WHAT SAID ANNA AND IN THE SAME MOMENT GUESSED THEY SAY OLD TITUS PRICE EMBEZZLED FIFTY POUNDS FROM THE BUILDING FUND AND HENRY MADE IT UP PRIVATELY
INTO HIS POCKET HE WAS NOT THINKING OF THE NOTE AT ALL
ALWAYS THE HAND WITH WHICH HE TOUCHED HER ARM SHOOK LIKE AN OLD MAN'S HAND AS THEIR EYES MET IN AN INTENSE AND PAINFUL GAZE TO HER AT LEAST IT WAS REVEALED THAT THEY WERE LOVERS
AND THE HOUSE LINEN WHAT DO YOU SAY OH BEATRICE REPLIED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION A COUPLE OF HUNDRED AT LEAST MISSUS SUTTON READING ANNA'S FACE SMILED REASSURINGLY
IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE MISS DICKINSON TOLD ME YOU WILL BE GLAD TO KNOW LADIES MYNORS VOICE SANG OUT FROM THE PLATFORM THAT THE TOTAL PROCEEDS SO FAR AS WE CAN CALCULATE THEM NOW
IT OCCURRED TO MISSUS SUTTON TO REFLECT THAT ANNA AT SUCH A PERIOD OF LIFE SHOULD BE OTHERWISE EMPLOYED ANNA HAD CALLED AT THE SUTTONS TO DELIVER SOME FINISHED GARMENTS MY DEAR SHE SAID
THE PRICE OF ADMISSION HAD BEEN REDUCED TO THREEPENCE IN ORDER THAT THE ARTISAN MIGHT ENTER AND SPEND HIS WAGES IN AN EXCELLENT CAUSE THE SEVEN STALLS RANGED ROUND THE ROOM LIKE SO MANY BOWERS OF BEAUTY
HAVE YOU HEARD HE ASKED SIMPLY ABOUT WHAT SHE WHISPERED ABOUT MY POOR OLD FATHER YES I WAS HOPING HOPING YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW
FATHER IT ISN'T HER VOICE BROKE BUT ONLY FOR AN INSTANT I'M ASKING YOU FOR MY OWN MONEY YOU SEEM TO WANT TO MAKE ME MISERABLE JUST BEFORE MY WEDDING I WISH TO GOD THOU DST NEVER SEEN HENRY MYNORS
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ANNA SAID BEATRICE WHEN AFTER ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE BAZAAR WAS CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC AND THE STALL HOLDERS AND THEIR ASSISTANTS WERE PREPARING TO DEPART THEIR MOVEMENTS HASTENED BY THE STERN ASPECT
AND WHEN I STUCK TO HIM HE GOT ANGRY YOU KNOW HE CAN'T BEAR TO SEE MONEY SPENT AND AT LAST HE GET A LITTLE SAVAGE AND GAVE ME MY BANK BOOKS AND SAID HE'D HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH MY MONEY
PALE BITING HER LIPS AND ALMOST CRYING SHE WENT OUT TO THE ENTRY AND BEGAN PUTTING ON HER THINGS YOU ARE NOT GOING
OF COURSE I WOULD NOT GIVE THEM UP BECAUSE THEY WERE MY OWN
HER HEAD ACHES SAID THE TAX COLLECTOR FOR HIS WIFE COMING OUT OF THE CLUB THE HUSBAND AND WIFE WALKED ALL THE WAY HOME IN SILENCE THE TAX COLLECTOR WALKED BEHIND HIS WIFE AND WATCHING HER DOWNCAST SORROWFUL HUMILIATED LITTLE FIGURE
YOU ARE NO MORE THAN A CHILD TO ME BUT YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME I HOPE I HAVE NOT INJURED YOU LORD GEORGE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU RODE TO HOUNDS THE DAY YOUR COUSIN TOOK THAT OTHER MAN'S HORSE THAT SURPRISED ME
AND LISTENED GREEDILY TO THE BAND PLAYING THE MARCH LOOKING AT THEIR PALE ECSTATIC FACES ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THOSE STRAINS CAME FROM SOME HEAVENLY CHOIR
I WOULDN'T MIND IT SO MUCH IF ANYBODY WERE THE BETTER FOR IT
THAT LIFE WAS BY NO MEANS SO DELIGHTFUL AS SHE FANCIED NOW IN HER EXCITEMENT YOU WAIT I'LL TEACH YOU TO SMILE SO BLISSFULLY HE MUTTERED YOU ARE NOT A BOARDING SCHOOL MISS YOU ARE NOT A GIRL AN OLD FRIGHT OUGHT TO REALISE SHE IS A FRIGHT
THE LADIES OF K HEARING THE REGIMENT APPROACHING FORSOOK THEIR PANS OF BOILING JAM AND RAN INTO THE STREET FORGETTING THEIR MORNING DESHABILLE AND GENERAL UNTIDINESS THEY RUSHED BREATHLESS WITH EXCITEMENT TO MEET THE REGIMENT
IS IS OH LORD GEORGE DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT SHE IS I KNOW THAT MISSUS CARBUNCLE IS IN A VERY BAD WAY AND THAT THAT GIRL HAS GONE CRAZY AND THAT POOR GRIFF HAS TAKEN HIMSELF OFF TO JAPAN AND THAT I AM SO KNOCKED ABOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO
YOU YOU YOURSELF COULDN'T HAVE SUSPECTED ME OF TAKING THE DIAMONDS BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU'D GOT THEM YOU KNOW ALL SAFE IN YOUR POCKET BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL OWN THE TRUTH NOW DIDN'T YOU THINK THAT IT WAS I WHO STOLE THE BOX
HAD THERE BEEN ANY DEVOTION BUT LORD GEORGE WAS BOTH IMPUDENT AND INDIFFERENT YES SHE SAID THANK GOODNESS I SHALL GET OUT OF THIS FRIGHTFUL PLACE TO MORROW AND SOON HAVE ONCE MORE A ROOF OF MY OWN OVER MY HEAD
THEY'D NOT OBJECT TO MAKING LOVE TO HER I DARE SAY DURING THE MAZURKA THE TAX COLLECTOR'S FACE TWITCHED WITH SPITE A BLACK HAIRED OFFICER WITH PROMINENT EYES AND TARTAR CHEEKBONES DANCED THE MAZURKA WITH ANNA PAVLOVNA
HAD BECOME THE FIRST DEPOSITORY OF HER GREAT SECRET AND HAD PLACED NO MUTUAL CONFIDENCE IN HER HE HAD BEEN HARSH TO HER AND UNJUST AND THEN TOO HE HAD DECLINED TO BE IN LOVE WITH HER SHE WAS FULL OF SPITE AGAINST LORD GEORGE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO INJURE HIM
NOT LAUGHING LORD GEORGE YES YOU WERE YOU HAD GOT THE KERNEL YOURSELF AND THOUGHT THAT I HAD TAKEN ALL THE TROUBLE TO CRACK THE NUT AND HAD FOUND MYSELF WITH NOTHING BUT THE SHELL THEN WHEN YOU FOUND YOU COULDN'T EAT THE KERNEL THAT YOU COULDN'T GET RID OF THE SWAG WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
OF COURSE NOT WHERE DO WE POOR COUNTRY BUMPKINS COME IN SNEERED THE TAX COLLECTOR WE ARE AT A DISCOUNT NOW WE'RE CLUMSY SEALS UNPOLISHED PROVINCIAL BEARS AND SHE'S THE QUEEN OF THE BALL
HE WENT INTO THE HALL AND WALKED UP TO HIS WIFE ANNA PAVLOVNA WAS SITTING WITH HER PARTNER AND FLIRTING HER FAN AND COQUETTISHLY DROPPING HER EYELIDS WAS DESCRIBING HOW SHE USED TO DANCE IN PETERSBURG HER LIPS WERE PURSED UP LIKE A ROSEBUD AND SHE PRONOUNCED
OVER WHICH OF THEM SHOULD I WASTE MY TIME THEN THE TIGER BROKE LOOSE IN THE MAN WHO FROM THE AGGRESSOR HAD BECOME THE ATTACKED AND HE CRIED I SHALL NEVER ANSWER THE DEVIL HAS WHISPERED HIS OWN SUGGESTIONS IN YOUR EAR THE DEVIL AND NOTHING ELSE
THAT YOUR WORK IS A TRAITOR'S WORK THAT THE GLORIFICATION YOU SPEAK OF IS FALSE THAT YOU MAY TALK IN MY FAVOR
WHICH NAME STEELE OR BRAINARD YOU ACKNOWLEDGED BOTH MY REAL NAME IS BRAINARD THEREFORE IT IS ALSO HERS BUT I SHALL BE CONTENT IF SHE WILL TAKE MY PRESENT ONE OF STEELE
YOU SEE WE HAVE ALL OF US BEEN MADE REMARKABLE HAVEN'T WE YOU ARE ALWAYS REMARKABLE LORD GEORGE
ASSUMING A STERN EXPRESSION HE WORKED HIS LEGS WITH GRAVITY AND FEELING AND SO CROOKED HIS KNEES THAT HE LOOKED LIKE A JACK A DANDY PULLED BY STRINGS WHILE ANNA PAVLOVNA PALE AND THRILLED BENDING HER FIGURE LANGUIDLY AND TURNING HER EYES UP
A NARROW SPITEFUL SOUL GIVEN TO DRINK WITH A BIG CLOSELY CROPPED HEAD AND THICK PROTRUDING LIPS
SPRANG IN AND SEIZED UPON THE OTHER WITH A VIOLENCE OF PASSION
THE INNS AND RESTAURANTS KEEP OPEN ALL NIGHT THE MILITARY COMMANDANT HIS SECRETARY AND THE LOCAL GARRISON PUT ON THEIR BEST UNIFORMS THE POLICE FLIT TO AND FRO LIKE MAD WHILE THE EFFECT ON THE LADIES IS BEYOND ALL DESCRIPTION
A LITTLE BRUNETTE OF THIRTY WITH A LONG NOSE AND A POINTED CHIN TIGHTLY LACED WITH HER FACE CAREFULLY POWDERED SHE DANCED WITHOUT PAUSING FOR BREATH DANCED TILL SHE WAS READY TO DROP EXHAUSTED BUT THOUGH SHE WAS EXHAUSTED IN BODY
HE RECALLED THE LOOK OF BEATITUDE WHICH HAD SO IRRITATED HIM AT THE CLUB AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE BEATITUDE WAS GONE FILLED HIS SOUL WITH TRIUMPH HE WAS PLEASED AND SATISFIED AND AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THE LACK OF SOMETHING
AS TO THE MONEY WHICH LADY EUSTACE CLAIMED MISSUS CARBUNCLE ASSERTED THAT WHEN THE FINAL ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE MADE UP BETWEEN THEM IT WOULD BE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE BALANCE DUE TO MISSUS CARBUNCLE BUT EVEN WERE THERE ANYTHING DUE TO LADY EUSTACE
YOU'RE A PRETTY FIGURE UPON MY SOUL
MISSUS CARBUNCLE WOULD DECLINE TO PAY IT AS SHE WAS INFORMED THAT ALL MONEYS POSSESSED BY LADY EUSTACE WERE NOW CONFISCATED TO THE CROWN BY REASON OF THE PERJURIES THE WORD WAS DOUBLY SCORED IN MISSUS CARBUNCLE'S NOTE WHICH LADY EUSTACE HAD COMMITTED
AND LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH HIS HEAD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE LIZZIE'S ANGER AGAINST THE MAN CHIEFLY AROSE FROM A FEELING THAT HE TREATED HER WITH ALL A CORSAIR'S FREEDOM WITHOUT ANY OF A CORSAIR'S TENDERNESS
NOW THEN SAID THE TALL MAN QUICKLY IT'S OF NO USE WE MUST GO DOWN
MAY ENTIRELY BE FORGOTTEN I GIVE AND BEQUEATH TO HIM FOR HIS SOLE USE AND ENJOYMENT AND IN THE HOPE THAT WITH THE HELP AND ADVICE OF MY OLD FRIEND JOSHUA GIRTLE HE WILL SENSIBLY INVEST
THAT A TESTATOR HAS A PERFECT RIGHT TO DO WHAT HE LIKES WITH HIS OWN THEN YOU INFLUENCED HIM CRIED ARTIS FURIOUSLY I SHALL DISPUTE THE WILL THE OLD GENTLEMAN SMILED
AND NOT WITHOUT EMITTING A LOUD NOISE THE WORK OF CUTTING BEGAN THE SAWDUST FALLING LIGHTLY ON THE LION'S SKIN BUT AT THE END OF A FEW SECONDS A DULL HARSH SOUND
AS THE MEN STRAINED AT IT IN TURN HERE LET'S TRY A SAW CENTRE BIT A CENTRE BIT WAS FITTED INTO A STOCK AND A HOLE CUT RIGHT THROUGH INTO THIS AFTER MUCH GREASING
RISING SUPERIOR TO THE OVERTHROW OF ALL HIS HOPES FOR A WOMAN OF EDITH'S PRINCIPLE TO SEEK DEATH IN A MOMENT OF DESPERATION THE PROVOCATION MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GREAT
HIS FEET BECAME ENTANGLED IN THE CURTAIN AND HE FELL HEAVILY WITH HIS ADVERSARY UPON HIM QUICK MORRIS WHISPERED A VOICE NO NO CURSE YOU SHUT THE WINDOW THERE'S ONLY ONE
WE'D LIKE HOWEVER TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU IN YOUR UNFORTUNATE SITUATION ADDIE GRAHAM CONTINUED WITH A GUSH OF SEEMING FRIENDLINESS I'M SURE MY BROTHER JAMES HE'S SIXTEEN YEARS OLD
THAT THERE MAY BE NO MISTAKE ONE HUNDRED POUNDS EACH TO MISS D'ENGHIEN AND MYSELF IT IS ABSURD PALTRY PITIFUL YOU NEVER SAW THE TESTATOR MISTER ARTIS NO SIR
SAID ARTIS IN AN AUDIBLE VOICE AND AS I BEING NOW IN FULL POSSESSION OF MY SENSES CONTINUED MISTER GIRTLE SLIGHTLY RAISING HIS VOICE
THEN AFTER WHAT SEEMED AN AGE OF SUSPENSE THE OLD SOLICITOR WENT ON THE SUM OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS FREE OF DUTY TO BUY MOURNING THERE WAS A DEATH LIKE STILLNESS AS THE LAWYER PAUSED
THE OTHER GRAHAM GIRL DECLARED VENGEFULLY HAVEN'T YOU ANY IDEA WHO DID IT NONE THAT IS VERY TANGIBLE MISS LADD REPLIED
AND LIVE CLOSE TO NATURE YOU KNOW
THAT'S IT IS IT QUIET WILL YOU HE STOOD LISTENING ATTENTIVELY IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE ISN'T A SOUND LET'S GO THEN AT ONCE WHAT EMPTY
KEEP THAT LIGHT STILL WILL YOU HE CRIED MENACINGLY WHY
THERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION POSSIBLE FOR THIS ACT OSWALD BITTER AS IT IS FOR ME TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT I AM THUS FAR GUILTY OF THIS BELOVED WOMAN'S DEATH BUT
IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT ASSOCIATE WITH THE FAMILY THAT HAD CUSTODY OF THE LITTLE BOY IN WHOSE INTERESTS THEY WERE WORKING ANY ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART THEY FELT TO DISCUSS SOCIETY
THE LITTLE MAN TOOK A BUNCH FROM THE BAG BUT
THOUGH ONLY JUST BEGUN WOULD LAST HIS LIFETIME NOTHING COULD STOP THEM NOW NOTHING NOTHING AND HE LAUGHED AS THE THOUGHT WENT HOME LAUGHED AT THE IRONY OF FATE
KNOW THAT THIS IS A STRANGE AND ARDUOUS BURDEN TO LAY UPON MY HEIR IN CHIEF
THERE WAS A BUZZ OF CONGRATULATION HERE AS THE OLD SOLICITOR ONCE MORE WIPED HIS GLASSES AND ARRANGED THEM AND THE CANDLES WHILE IN SPITE OF HIS ENDEAVOURS TO PRESERVE HIS CALMNESS
BUT AS THE THIRD FELLOW CAUGHT HIM BY THE WRIST THE YOUNG MAN WRENCHED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HEAVED HIMSELF UP SO THAT HE PARTIALLY DISLODGED THE RUFFIAN WHO HELD HIM DOWN
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE CAN'T WE SAID THE MAN BETWEEN HIS TEETH MORE CAN'T YOU NOW THEN WILL YOU THROW DOWN THAT SWORD NO SAID CAPEL FURIOUSLY YOU'VE WALKED INTO A TRAP SO GIVE UP
HE WAS ALONE WITH HIS PAST HIS PRESENT AND HIS FUTURE ALONE HE NEEDED TO BE THE STRONGEST MUST PAUSE WHEN THE PRECIPICE YAWNS BEFORE HIM THE GULF CAN BE SPANNED
LAUGHED AT HIS OWN DEFEAT AND HIS NEARNESS TO A BARRED PARADISE OSWALD LOVED EDITH LOVED HER YET WITH A FLAME TIME WOULD TAKE LONG TO QUENCH DORIS LOVED OSWALD AND HE DORIS
OF THE SAID FREEHOLD AS ABOVE NAMED
JUST ABOUT WHERE SHE SAID THE STONE THAT WAS THROWN AT HER FELL
LYDIA MURMURED AN ASSENT
RETURNED MISS LADD WITH A WARMTH THAT SEEMED TO INDICATE ACCEPTANCE OF THE OFFER THE TRUTH WAS THAT ANYTHING WHICH TENDED TO INCREASE
IN RESPECT OF WHOSE SERVICES
THEN THERE WAS THE FAINT STREAK OF LIGHT AS A MATCH WAS STRUCK THE BULL'S EYE LANTERN WAS PICKED UP AND RE LIT AND THE BRIGHT RAYS ONCE MORE PLAYED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM
TOLD THAT THE SAW WAS MEETING METAL AND A FRESH START HAD TO BE MADE FOR FULLY TWO HOURS DID THE MEN WORK TO GET THROUGH BORING AND SAWING IN PLACE AFTER PLACE
BUT SHE MISTOOK MY PURPOSE AND AND WHAT ORLANDO HESITATED EVEN HIS IRON NATURE TREMBLED BEFORE THE MISERY HE SAW A MISERY HE WAS DESTINED TO AUGMENT RATHER THAN SOOTHE
OH DON'T YOU SEE TOO THAT IF THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE TIME WE OUGHT TO SPEND IT TOGETHER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID IT'S NO GOOD I MUST SET MY TEETH AND BEAR IT AND YOU I HOPE IT WON'T BE AS HARD FOR YOU AS IT WILL FOR ME
AND IT FORBIDS A MAN WITH AN INCOME OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY A YEAR TO SPEAK OF LOVE TO A GIRL WHO IS RECKONED AN HEIRESS THERE ARE PLENTY WHO TRANSGRESS THE CODE BUT THEY ARE IN ALL THE OTHER STORIES
WHEN WAR WAS DECLARED MISS CAVELL LOST NO TIME IN HURRYING BACK TO BRUSSELS BELIEVING THAT HER DUTY CALLED HER THERE SHE WROTE A LETTER COMMENTING ON THE GERMAN ARMY WHEN IT SWEPT THROUGH BELGIUM AND IN IT SHE VOICED HER PITY FOR THE TIRED FOOTSORE GERMAN SOLDIERS
AFTER THE EXECUTION THEY REFUSED TO RETURN THE BODY BUT THE NAME OF EDITH CAVELL HAS BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NAMES AND HER FAME GROWS BRIGHTER AS TIME PASSES
TO GET WHAT INFORMATION HE COULD FROM BRAND WHITLOCK THE AMERICAN MINISTER IN BELGIUM HE WENT AT ONCE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES BUT THEY EVADED HIS QUESTIONS AND WAITED TEN DAYS BEFORE GIVING HIM A REPLY THEN THE GERMANS SENT HIM A STATEMENT
ONLY TO LEARN LATER THAT IT HAD INDEED BEEN DECLARED AND THAT MISS CAVELL WOULD FACE A FIRING SQUAD AT TWO O'CLOCK THE FOLLOWING MORNING MISTER WHITLOCK THEN URGED BARON VON DER LANCKEN
THE LOVER WHO CAME TO HIS LOVE OVER STREWN WALLFLOWERS DESIRED ALWAYS AS HAS BEEN SEEN TO ACT UP TO HIS MORAL IDEAS SO HE TOOK NEXT DAY A MUCH EARLIER TRAIN THAN WAS AT ALL PLEASANT
HE HAD A LITTLE FIGHT WITH HIMSELF AS HE WENT DOWN WIMPOLE STREET THEN HE HAILED A HANSOM AND WENT AND TOLD HER FATHER WHO QUITE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IT WAS ALL OVER THE FATHER WONDERED AT HIMSELF FOR BEING MORE SORRY THAN GLAD
HAD LOVED HIM THESE TWO YEARS HAD LOVED HIM SINCE THE DAY OF THEIR FIRST MEETING AND THAT WAS JUST AS LONG AS HE HAD LOVED HER BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIS LOVE THERE IS A CODE OF HONOUR RIGHT OR WRONG
ITS EFFECT MAY BE INDICATED BRIEFLY IT SHOWED THE FATHER THAT THE GIRL'S HAPPINESS HAD HAD TWO LONG YEARS IN WHICH TO LEARN TO GROW ROUND THE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOM HE NOW FACED FOR THE FIRST TIME ODD
FOR TO THE FATHER HE SEEMED JUST LIKE OTHER YOUNG MEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WERE SO MANY MORE OF THE SAME PATTERN FROM WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN AND MANY OF THEM WELL OFF TOO HOWEVER THE LETTER LAY IN THE PROSPEROUS POCKET BOOK IN THE BREAST OF THE FATHER'S FROCK COAT
THE YOUNG MAN MADE A REVERENT NOTE OF THE NAME AND THE INTERVIEW SEEMED PLAYED OUT IT'S A COMPLICATED NUISANCE THE FATHER MUSED IT ISN'T EVEN AS IF I KNEW ANYTHING OF THE CHAP I OUGHTN'T TO HAVE ALLOWED THE CHILD TO MAKE THESE LONG VISITS TO HER AUNT
ONE THING HE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THOSE PRETTY VIVIDLY THE CONFOUNDED PUP THE ONLOOKER HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING WRONGER THAN YOU HAVE DONE MY GOOD READER AND HE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET A GIANT TEMPTATION ANY MORE THAN YOU DO
AND GRADUALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHOLE WORTH OF LIFE SEEMED TO LIE IN THE FAINT FAR CHANCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO UNDO THE ONE TRIUMPHANTLY IMPULSIVE AND UNREASONING ACTION OF HIS LIFE
SHE WAS TRIED WITH GREAT HASTE AND WITH GREAT SECRECY AND AFTER THE TRIAL THE SENTENCE WAS CARRIED OUT FAR MORE SPEEDILY THAN USUAL MOREOVER THEY HAD DECEIVED MISTER WHITLOCK AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN LEGATION AND HAD DONE SO DELIBERATELY
IT'S BETTER TO DIE OF A BULLET IN SOUTH AFRICA THAN OF FRIGHT IN LONDON THAT ROUSED THE LOVER AS IT WAS MEANT TO DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IT IS OF YOURS SIR HE SAID
HE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SECURE HER PARDON OR AT LEAST A MODERATION OF THE PUNISHMENT HE WROTE TO BARON VON DER LANCKEN POINTING OUT IN A CLEAR AND DECISIVE MANNER THAT MISS CAVELL HAD SERVED THE GERMANS BY CARING FOR THEIR WOUNDED
SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES KNOW OF THE AFFAIR OR OF WHAT THEY PROPOSED TO DO BUT WORD OF HER PLIGHT DID REACH ENGLAND THROUGH A TRAVELER AND AT ONCE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REQUESTED THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR DOCTOR PAGE
AND THE LOVER WAS RECEIVED AS THOUGH THAT LETTER WERE A CHARM TO ENSURE SUCCESS A FAULTY OR AT LEAST A SLOW WORKING CHARM HOWEVER FOR THE FATHER DID NOT LIFT A BAG OF GOLD FROM HIS SAFE AND SAY TAKE HER TAKE THIS ALSO BE HAPPY
ALL THROUGH THE DAY THE AMERICAN LEGATION SENT MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES ASKING FOR INFORMATION THEY RECEIVED NONE AT SIX TWENTY IN THE EVENING THEY WERE TOLD BY A SUBORDINATE THAT THE SENTENCE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN
WHY SHOULD HE HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM THREE WEEKS AGO HE'S A VERY OLD FRIEND OF OURS I DO HATE TO BE SUSPICIOUS BUT IT IS ODD AND THEN HIS TRYING TO GET YOU TO SOUTH AFRICA
EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HER EYES BANDAGED MISS CAVELL WAS LED OUT TO FACE THE RIFLES OF THE HUNS SHE WORE AN ENGLISH FLAG OVER HER BOSOM ONLY GERMANS WERE WITNESSES OF THE EXECUTION BUT THE GERMAN CHAPLAIN WHO ATTENDED SAID THAT SHE DIED LIKE A HEROINE
I SUPPOSE IT WAS YOU WHO SAW HIM BY THE WAY SAID HE A TALL WELL SET UP YOUNG FELLOW DARK NOT BAD LOOKING I I DON'T REMEMBER LIED THE ONLOOKER
BUT I APPEAL TO YOUR GENEROSITY OF HEART TO SUPPORT IT AND SAVE THIS UNFORTUNATE WOMAN FROM DEATH HAVE PITY ON HER BRAND WHITLOCK
BUT THIS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES THEY WERE DETERMINED TO DETECT HER IN SOME CRIME AND PUNISH HER IT WAS NOT FITTING THEY THOUGHT THAT AN ENEMY SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN WORKS OF MERCY EVEN THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT BENEFIT THEREBY
DON'T MEAN THAT I KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT THANK GOD OH THANK GOD I MEAN DON'T YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE LIED TO YOU TO PREVENT YOUR MARRYING ME
THEY SHINE LIKE GOLD SHE SAID
HE TURNED AWAY AND WENT BACK ALONG THE GREEN PATH WITH HELL IN HIS HEART THE OTHER TWO WERE IN PARADISE THE ONLOOKER FELL LIKE THE THIRD IN EDEN THE SERPENT IN FACT TWO MILES AWAY HE STOPPED AND LIT A PIPE
PRINCESS MARY LOOKED FRIGHTENED THE DOOR OPENED AND THE OLD PRINCE IN A DRESSING GOWN AND A WHITE NIGHTCAP CAME IN AH MADAM HE BEGAN MADAM COUNTESS
THEY HAVE PUT ON CLEAN SHIRTS AH A WONDERFUL A MATCHLESS PEOPLE SAID KUTUZOV AND HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND SWAYED HIS HEAD A MATCHLESS PEOPLE HE REPEATED WITH A SIGH
THIS MAN WAS SPEAKING TO SOMEONE IN THE ADJOINING ROOM A GOOD FIGURE AND IN HER FIRST BLOOM
AFTER FIVE MINUTES OF IRKSOME CONSTRAINED CONVERSATION
HE BECKONED TO ANDREW KAYSAROV HIS ADJUTANT'S BROTHER THOSE VERSES
AND THAT BENNIGSEN MANAGED EVERYTHING NOW THE DECISIVE MOMENT OF BATTLE HAD COME WHEN KUTUZOV WOULD BE DESTROYED AND THE POWER PASS TO BENNIGSEN
NATASHA SUDDENLY SHRANK INTO HERSELF AND INVOLUNTARILY ASSUMED AN OFFHAND AIR WHICH ALIENATED PRINCESS MARY STILL MORE
TELL HIM TO COME LATER HE'LL BE COMING OUT DIRECTLY WE MUST GO LATER LATER TOMORROW IT'S TOO LATE ROSTOV TURNED AND WAS ABOUT TO GO BUT THE MAN IN THE BRACES STOPPED HIM
THEY WAITED A LONG TIME FOR NATASHA TO COME TO DINNER THAT DAY SHE SAT IN HER ROOM CRYING LIKE A CHILD BLOWING HER NOSE AND SOBBING SONYA STOOD BESIDE HER KISSING HER HAIR
AND HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLY TO ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT MOSCOW THAT WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM OR TO LISTEN TO ALL THAT WAS TOLD HIM
KUTUZOV NOTICED PIERRE'S FIGURE AND THE GROUP GATHERED ROUND HIM CALL HIM TO ME SAID KUTUZOV
I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE ONE OF YOUR WIFE'S ADORERS IS SHE WELL MY QUARTERS ARE AT YOUR SERVICE AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS WITH OLD PEOPLE
NO I WON'T MISS MY OPPORTUNITY NOW AS I DID AFTER AUSTERLITZ HE THOUGHT EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO MEET THE MONARCH AND CONSCIOUS OF THE BLOOD THAT RUSHED TO HIS HEART
COUNTESS ROSTOVA IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN I BEG YOU TO EXCUSE ME TO EXCUSE ME I DID NOT KNOW MADAM
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE RIGHT FLANK
IN THE DOGS SQUARE AND THEN
AS IF I DON'T TALK ABOUT IT NATASHA
WHOM HAVE YOU COME FROM WHO ARE YOU I COME FROM MAJOR DENISOV ANSWERED ROSTOV
AFTER A FEW WORDS TO PIERRE ABOUT THE AWFUL ROADS FROM THE POLISH FRONTIER ABOUT PEOPLE HE HAD MET IN SWITZERLAND WHO KNEW PIERRE
TO PIERRE THAT SMILE SAID PLAINLY I AM WELL
SO READY TO BE FOND OF HIM FOR BEING HIS FATHER AND OF HER FOR BEING HIS SISTER
BUT I DON'T KNOW SAID PIERRE WELL IT DOESN'T MATTER SAID PRINCE ANDREW TELL COUNTESS ROSTOVA THAT SHE WAS AND IS PERFECTLY FREE
AND BY THOSE WHO WERE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND HIS AIMS TO JUDGE A MAN WHO IS IN DISFAVOR
THE THOUGHT OF MEETING THE EMPEROR AT ANY MOMENT WAS SO FASCINATING AND CONSEQUENTLY SO ALARMING THAT HE WAS READY TO RUN AWAY BUT THE OFFICIAL WHO HAD QUESTIONED HIM OPENED THE DOOR AND ROSTOV ENTERED
PRINCESS MARY WAS THE SAME AS ALWAYS BUT BENEATH HER SYMPATHY FOR HER BROTHER PIERRE NOTICED HER SATISFACTION THAT THE ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF LOOKING AT THEM PIERRE REALIZED
THE MONARCH CAME OUT INTO THE PORCH PUTTING ON HIS GLOVES AND CARRYING HIS HAT UNDER HIS ARM
THAT SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF ANYBODY THE PRINCESS TOLD THE COUNT THAT SHE WOULD BE DELIGHTED AND ONLY BEGGED HIM TO STAY LONGER AT ANNA SEMENOVNA'S AND HE DEPARTED
BUT I MAINTAIN THAT IF ANYTHING GOOD HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THIS REIGN IT WAS DONE BY HIM BY HIM ALONE HE PAUSED AT THE SIGHT OF PIERRE HIS FACE QUIVERED
IN ALL ITS OLD FORCE IN THE UNIFORM OF THE PREOBRAZHENSK REGIMENT WHITE CHAMOIS LEATHER BREECHES AND HIGH BOOTS AND WEARING A STAR ROSTOV DID NOT KNOW IT WAS THAT OF THE LEGION D'HONNEUR
YES YES BUT WHERE IS PRINCE BOLKONSKI'S REGIMENT
AND AT EASE FROM THE FIRST GLANCE PRINCESS MARY DID NOT LIKE NATASHA SHE THOUGHT HER TOO FASHIONABLY DRESSED FRIVOLOUSLY GAY AND VAIN
SHE WAS PREJUDICED AGAINST HER BY INVOLUNTARY ENVY OF HER BEAUTY YOUTH AND HAPPINESS AS WELL AS BY JEALOUSY OF HER BROTHER'S LOVE FOR HER
NATASHA NOTICED THIS AND GUESSED ITS REASON I THINK PRINCESS IT IS NOT CONVENIENT TO SPEAK OF THAT NOW SHE SAID WITH EXTERNAL DIGNITY AND COLDNESS THOUGH SHE FELT THE TEARS CHOKING HER
THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO MOVE HER TO THE COUNTRY AND SO THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN SENT FOR PIERRE SAW THE DISTRACTED COUNT AND SONYA WHO HAD A TEAR STAINED FACE BUT HE COULD NOT SEE NATASHA
THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS IN A STATE OF ALARM AND COMMOTION NATASHA WAS VERY ILL
COMPLETE THE TASK UNOBSERVED AT PICCADILLY CIRCUS I DISCHARGED MY CAB AND WALKED WESTWARD BEYOND THE JUNIOR CONSTITUTIONAL I CAME ACROSS THE HOUSE DESCRIBED AND WAS SATISFIED THAT THIS WAS THE NEXT OF THE LAIRS ARRANGED BY DRACULA
I MADE ONE MORE ATTEMPT TO FURTHER MATTERS YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY KEY NEVER USED NO KEY NOR NOTHINK THE OLD GENT HE OPENED THE DOOR ISSELF AN SHUT IT AGAIN WHEN I DRUV OFF I DON'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME BUT THAT WAS THE BEER
HIS IS A CURIOUS CASE INDEED WE MUST WATCH HIM TO NIGHT LETTER MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY TO LORD GODALMING
EVENING I FOUND THOMAS SNELLING IN HIS HOUSE AT BETHNAL GREEN BUT UNHAPPILY HE WAS NOT IN A CONDITION TO REMEMBER ANYTHING
HOW THIS PHRASE THRILLED THROUGH ME WHY E TOOK UP IS END O THE BOXES LIKE THEY WAS POUNDS OF TEA AND ME A PUFFIN AN A BLOWIN AFORE I COULD UP END MINE ANYHOW AN I'M NO CHICKEN NEITHER
RENFIELD MIGHT NOT SPEAK SO FREELY BEFORE A THIRD PERSON AS WHEN HE AND I WERE ALONE
WITH A LAUGH HE REPLIED NOT MUCH FLIES ARE POOR THINGS AFTER ALL AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED BUT I DON'T WANT THEIR SOULS BUZZING ROUND ME ALL THE SAME OR SPIDERS I WENT ON BLOW SPIDERS WHAT'S THE USE OF SPIDERS
MINA IS FAST ASLEEP AND LOOKS A LITTLE TOO PALE HER EYES LOOK AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN CRYING POOR DEAR I'VE NO DOUBT IT FRETS HER TO BE KEPT IN THE DARK AND IT MAY MAKE HER DOUBLY ANXIOUS ABOUT ME AND THE OTHERS
I DETERMINED NOT TO WAKE HER BUT THAT WHEN I SHOULD RETURN FROM THIS NEW SEARCH I WOULD ARRANGE FOR HER GOING BACK TO EXETER I THINK SHE WOULD BE HAPPIER IN OUR OWN HOME WITH HER DAILY TASKS TO INTEREST HER
HE DID NOT REPLY FOR A MOMENT BUT LOOKED ALL ROUND HIM AND UP AND DOWN AS THOUGH HE EXPECTED TO FIND SOME INSPIRATION FOR AN ANSWER I DON'T WANT ANY SOULS HE SAID IN A FEEBLE APOLOGETIC WAY
THAT WILD YELL SEEMED TO COME FROM HIS ROOM THE ATTENDANT CAME BURSTING INTO MY ROOM AND TOLD ME THAT RENFIELD HAD SOMEHOW MET WITH SOME ACCIDENT HE HAD HEARD HIM YELL AND WHEN HE WENT TO HIM FOUND HIM LYING ON HIS FACE ON THE FLOOR ALL COVERED WITH BLOOD
IT WAS EVIDENT THEN THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT UNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION WAS DOING ITS WORK EVEN WITH THE LUNATIC I DETERMINED TO HAVE THE MATTER OUT WHAT ABOUT THEM YOURSELF I ASKED
SO THAT LATER HE MIGHT DISTRIBUTE MORE FULLY THE SYSTEMATIC MANNER IN WHICH THIS WAS DONE MADE ME THINK THAT HE COULD NOT MEAN TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO TWO SIDES OF LONDON HE WAS NOW FIXED ON THE FAR EAST OF THE NORTHERN SHORE ON THE EAST OF THE SOUTHERN SHORE
AS IT WOULD PERHAPS HAVE GIVEN SOME CLUE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE HOUSE I REMEMBERED MY EXPERIENCE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND PURCHASE OF CARFAX
THERE WAS THE OLD PARTY WHAT ENGAGED ME A WAITIN IN THE OUSE AT PURFLEET HE ELPED ME TO LIFT THE BOXES AND PUT THEM IN THE DRAY CURSE ME BUT HE WAS THE STRONGEST CHAP I EVER STRUCK
AS HE THOUGHT HE REMEMBERED SEEING THE NAME OF THAT FIRM ON THE BOARD I DID NOT WISH TO SEEM TOO EAGER OR TO LET MY INFORMANT KNOW OR GUESS TOO MUCH SO THANKING HIM IN THE USUAL MANNER I STROLLED AWAY IT WAS NOW GROWING DUSK
I THINK THAT THROUGH THE CLOUDINESS OF HIS INSANITY HE SAW SOME ANTAGONISM IN ME FOR HE AT ONCE FELL BACK ON THE LAST REFUGE OF SUCH AS HE A DOGGED SILENCE
SHE SEEMS SOMEHOW MORE RECONCILED OR ELSE THE VERY SUBJECT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME REPUGNANT TO HER FOR WHEN ANY ACCIDENTAL ALLUSION IS MADE SHE ACTUALLY SHUDDERS I AM GLAD WE MADE OUR RESOLUTION IN TIME
BUT I DO MIND HE ANSWERED THE AFFAIRS OF THEIR CLIENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY SAFE IN THE HANDS OF MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY THIS WAS MANIFESTLY A PRIG OF THE FIRST WATER AND THERE WAS NO USE ARGUING WITH HIM
BUT I ASKED HOW ARE WE TO GET THE LIFE WITHOUT GETTING THE SOUL ALSO THIS SEEMED TO PUZZLE HIM SO I FOLLOWED IT UP
WE ALL SAT SILENT AWHILE AND ALL AT ONCE MISTER MORRIS SPOKE SAY HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET INTO THAT HOUSE WE GOT INTO THE OTHER ANSWERED LORD GODALMING QUICKLY BUT ART THIS IS DIFFERENT
AND ANOTHER SIX WHICH HE DEPOSITED AT JAMAICA LANE BERMONDSEY IF THEN THE COUNT MEANT TO SCATTER THESE GHASTLY REFUGES OF HIS OVER LONDON THESE PLACES WERE CHOSEN AS THE FIRST OF DELIVERY
I NEVER EARD OF IM IN ALL MY BLOOMIN DAYS DON'T BELIEVE THERE AIN'T NOBODY OF THAT KIND LIVIN ERE OR ANYWHERES I TOOK OUT SMOLLET'S LETTER AND AS I READ IT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE LESSON OF THE SPELLING OF THE NAME OF THE COURT MIGHT GUIDE ME WHAT ARE YOU
THE ORIGINAL VENDORS ARE THE EXECUTORS OF THE LATE MISTER ARCHIBALD WINTER SUFFIELD THE PURCHASER IS A FOREIGN NOBLEMAN COUNT DE VILLE WHO EFFECTED THE PURCHASE HIMSELF PAYING THE PURCHASE MONEY IN NOTES OVER THE COUNTER
BUT HE WOULD NOT ATTEND HE WENT ON WITH HIS SINGING JUST AS THOUGH WE HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT HE HAD GOT A SCRAP OF PAPER AND WAS FOLDING IT INTO A NOTE BOOK WE HAD TO COME AWAY AS IGNORANT AS WE WENT IN
I THOUGHT I WOULD PUSH HIS ANALOGY TO ITS UTMOST LOGICALLY SO I SAID QUICKLY OH IT IS A SOUL YOU ARE AFTER NOW IS IT HIS MADNESS FOILED HIS REASON AND A PUZZLED LOOK SPREAD OVER HIS FACE AS
WHEN SHE CAME BACK I ADDRESSED THE ENVELOPE AND STAMPED IT AND WHEN SMOLLET HAD AGAIN FAITHFULLY PROMISED TO POST THE ADDRESS WHEN FOUND I TOOK MY WAY TO HOME WE'RE ON THE TRACK ANYHOW I AM TIRED TO NIGHT
AND AS IT WOULD BE AT LEAST ADVISABLE TO WAIT TILL LORD GODALMING SHOULD HEAR FROM MITCHELL'S WE DECIDED NOT TO TAKE ANY ACTIVE STEP BEFORE BREAKFAST TIME FOR A GOOD WHILE WE SAT AND SMOKED DISCUSSING THE MATTER IN ITS VARIOUS LIGHTS AND BEARINGS
MY FEARS HOWEVER WERE GROUNDLESS FOR HE HELD UP HIS TWO HANDS IMPLORINGLY
THE PROFESSOR READ IT OVER GRAVELY AND HANDED IT BACK SAYING IT NEED NOT GO IN IF YOU DO NOT WISH IT
SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS WHEN HE WANTED A CAT
AMONGST THE MOUNTAINS OVER LAKE HERMANSTADT WHERE THE DEVIL CLAIMS THE TENTH SCHOLAR AS HIS DUE IN THE RECORDS ARE SUCH WORDS AS
THIS LOOK GAVE WAY TO ONE OF WONDER WHICH MERGED IN DOUBT THEN TO MY INTENSE ASTONISHMENT HE SAID YOU'RE NOT THE GIRL THE DOCTOR WANTED TO MARRY ARE YOU YOU CAN'T BE YOU KNOW FOR SHE'S DEAD
THERE WAS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN THE MAN'S MANNER SO MUCH OF THE HABIT OF EQUALITY THAT I AT ONCE MADE THE INTRODUCTION LORD GODALMING PROFESSOR VAN HELSING MISTER QUINCEY MORRIS OF TEXAS
WITHOUT HEART OR CONSCIENCE PREYING ON THE BODIES AND THE SOULS OF THOSE WE LOVE BEST TO US FOR EVER ARE THE GATES OF HEAVEN SHUT FOR WHO SHALL OPEN THEM TO US AGAIN WE GO ON FOR ALL TIME ABHORRED BY ALL A BLOT ON THE FACE OF GOD'S SUNSHINE
STRENGTH BEING THE BEST SAFETY THROUGH CARE OF ME BUT THEIR MINDS WERE MADE UP AND THOUGH IT WAS A BITTER PILL FOR ME TO SWALLOW I COULD SAY NOTHING SAVE TO ACCEPT THEIR CHIVALROUS CARE OF ME MISTER MORRIS RESUMED THE DISCUSSION AS THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE
IF NOT MORE STERN AND MOTIONED TO HIM THAT HIS EFFORTS WERE UNAVAILING I HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN SOMETHING OF THE SAME CONSTANTLY GROWING EXCITEMENT IN HIM WHEN HE HAD TO MAKE SOME REQUEST OF WHICH AT THE TIME
WHEN HE MADE THAT SO GOOD COMBINATION FRIEND JOHN UP TO NOW FORTUNE HAS MADE THAT WOMAN OF HELP TO US AFTER TO NIGHT SHE MUST NOT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS SO TERRIBLE AFFAIR IT IS NOT GOOD THAT SHE RUN A RISK SO GREAT WE MEN ARE DETERMINED NAY
YET MUST WE BE SATISFIED IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE NO OTHER MEANS IS AT OUR CONTROL AND SECONDLY BECAUSE AFTER ALL THESE THINGS TRADITION AND SUPERSTITION
WE HAVE PROOF BY INFERENCE THUS WHEREAS HE CAN DO AS HE WILL WITHIN HIS LIMIT WHEN HE HAVE HIS EARTH HOME HIS COFFIN HOME HIS HELL HOME THE PLACE UNHALLOWED AS WE SAW WHEN HE WENT TO THE GRAVE OF THE SUICIDE AT WHITBY STILL
SIR I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR DROPPING ALL FORMS OF CONVENTIONAL PREFIX WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL HAS REVOLUTIONISED THERAPEUTICS BY HIS DISCOVERY OF THE CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION OF BRAIN MATTER CONVENTIONAL FORMS ARE UNFITTING SINCE THEY WOULD SEEM TO LIMIT HIM TO ONE OF A CLASS
SO AS WE ALL TOOK HANDS OUR SOLEMN COMPACT WAS MADE I FELT MY HEART ICY COLD
AT OTHER TIME HE CAN ONLY CHANGE WHEN THE TIME COME IT IS SAID TOO THAT HE CAN ONLY PASS RUNNING WATER AT THE SLACK OR THE FLOOD OF THE TIDE THEN THERE ARE THINGS WHICH SO AFFLICT HIM THAT HE HAS NO POWER AS THE GARLIC THAT WE KNOW OF AND AS FOR THINGS SACRED AS THIS SYMBOL MY CRUCIFIX
WHICH IS AS HIS ETYMOLOGY IMPLY
HE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS YET HE IS NOT FREE NAY HE IS EVEN MORE PRISONER THAN THE SLAVE OF THE GALLEY THAN THE MADMAN IN HIS CELL HE CANNOT GO WHERE HE LISTS HE WHO IS NOT OF NATURE
AND TRY TO BEHAVE MORE DISCREETLY HE SUDDENLY STOPPED AND LOOKED AT ME INTENTLY FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS THEN WITHOUT A WORD HE ROSE AND MOVING OVER SAT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE BED THE COLLAPSE HAD COME
THOUGH NOW AND AGAIN WERE SCIONS WHO WERE HELD BY THEIR COEVALS TO HAVE HAD DEALINGS WITH THE EVIL ONE
AND WE GO ALONE I AGREED HEARTILY WITH HIM
FOR THE SAKE OF THE ALMIGHTY TAKE ME OUT OF THIS AND SAVE MY SOUL FROM GUILT CAN'T YOU HEAR ME MAN CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND WILL YOU NEVER LEARN DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I AM SANE AND EARNEST NOW THAT I AM NO LUNATIC IN A MAD FIT BUT A SANE MAN FIGHTING FOR HIS SOUL
YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERSTAND MISSUS HARKER THAT WHEN A MAN IS SO LOVED AND HONOURED AS OUR HOST IS EVERYTHING REGARDING HIM IS OF INTEREST IN OUR LITTLE COMMUNITY
OR HE ME I AM MISSUS HARKER
HE IS ONLY STRONGER AND BEING STRONGER HAVE YET MORE POWER TO WORK EVIL
WHICH YOU YOURSELF PUT UPON US BE WISE AND HELP US AND IF WE CAN WE SHALL AID YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR WISH HE STILL SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE SAID DOCTOR VAN HELSING I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY YOUR ARGUMENT IS COMPLETE AND IF I WERE FREE TO SPEAK I SHOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT
AND I TOOK CARE TO STAND WHERE I COULD SEIZE HIM AT ONCE IF HE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A SPRING AT HER SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM WITH AN EASY GRACEFULNESS WHICH WOULD AT ONCE COMMAND THE RESPECT OF ANY LUNATIC FOR EASINESS IS ONE OF THE QUALITIES MAD PEOPLE MOST RESPECT
HE SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OF THEM SAYING IN TURN LORD GODALMING I HAD THE HONOUR OF SECONDING YOUR FATHER AT THE WINDHAM I GRIEVE TO KNOW BY YOUR HOLDING THE TITLE THAT HE IS NO MORE HE WAS A MAN LOVED AND HONOURED BY ALL WHO KNEW HIM
BUT NONE OF THE OTHERS AT FIRST SAID ANYTHING HIS REQUEST WAS THAT I WOULD AT ONCE RELEASE HIM FROM THE ASYLUM AND SEND HIM HOME THIS HE BACKED UP WITH ARGUMENTS REGARDING HIS COMPLETE RECOVERY
FOR I HAD A GREATER FEAR THAT IF I APPEARED AS A DRAG OR A HINDRANCE TO THEIR WORK THEY MIGHT EVEN LEAVE ME OUT OF THEIR COUNSELS ALTOGETHER THEY HAVE NOW GONE OFF TO CARFAX WITH MEANS TO GET INTO THE HOUSE MANLIKE THEY HAD TOLD ME TO GO TO BED AND SLEEP
SO FAR FROM US IN ALL WAYS THERE EVEN IS HE AND THE PEOPLES FEAR HIM AT THIS DAY HE HAVE FOLLOW THE WAKE OF THE BERSERKER ICELANDER THE DEVIL BEGOTTEN HUN THE SLAV THE SAXON THE MAGYAR SO FAR THEN
OR IN ANY WAY DUE TO HER UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCE SHE MUST HAVE SOME RARE GIFT OR POWER WE CONTINUED TO TALK FOR SOME TIME AND SEEING THAT HE WAS SEEMINGLY QUITE REASONABLE SHE VENTURED
WHY WE KNOW NOT HE MAY NOT ENTER ANYWHERE AT THE FIRST UNLESS THERE BE SOME ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO BID HIM TO COME THOUGH AFTERWARDS HE CAN COME AS HE PLEASE HIS POWER CEASES AS DOES THAT OF ALL EVIL THINGS AT THE COMING OF THE DAY
A MINUTE LATER HE CAME IN AND SAID IT WAS AN IDIOTIC THING OF ME TO DO AND I ASK YOUR PARDON MISSUS HARKER MOST SINCERELY
THE PRIVILEGE YOU SEEK HE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY AND WITH A LOOK OF POIGNANT REGRET ON HIS FACE THE PROFESSOR WENT ON COME SIR BETHINK YOURSELF YOU CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE OF REASON IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
AND AN END TO ACHIEVE WHICH IS NOT A SELFISH ONE THESE THINGS ARE MUCH NOW LET US SEE HOW FAR THE GENERAL POWERS ARRAYED AGAINST US ARE RESTRICT AND HOW THE INDIVIDUAL CANNOT IN FINE LET US CONSIDER THE LIMITATIONS OF THE VAMPIRE IN GENERAL
NO ONE CAN FEEL MORE DEEPLY THAN HE DOES THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THE STARRY SKY THE SEA AND EVERY SIGHT AFFORDED BY THESE WONDERFUL REGIONS SEEM STILL TO HAVE THE POWER OF ELEVATING HIS SOUL FROM EARTH
DO NOT LEND HIS AID TO PERFECTIONATE OUR WEAK AND FAULTY NATURES I ONCE HAD A FRIEND THE MOST NOBLE OF HUMAN CREATURES AND AM ENTITLED THEREFORE TO JUDGE RESPECTING FRIENDSHIP YOU HAVE HOPE
ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK THE MIST CLEARED AWAY AND WE BEHELD STRETCHED OUT IN EVERY DIRECTION VAST AND IRREGULAR PLAINS OF ICE WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE NO END
THIS EXPEDITION HAS BEEN THE FAVOURITE DREAM OF MY EARLY YEARS I HAVE READ WITH ARDOUR THE ACCOUNTS OF THE VARIOUS VOYAGES WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PROSPECT OF ARRIVING AT THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN THROUGH THE SEAS WHICH SURROUND THE POLE
BUT THE OLD MAN DECIDEDLY REFUSED THINKING HIMSELF BOUND IN HONOUR TO MY FRIEND WHO WHEN HE FOUND THE FATHER INEXORABLE QUITTED HIS COUNTRY NOR RETURNED UNTIL HE HEARD THAT HIS FORMER MISTRESS WAS MARRIED ACCORDING TO HER INCLINATIONS
I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DISCOVER WHAT QUALITY IT IS WHICH HE POSSESSES THAT ELEVATES HIM SO IMMEASURABLY ABOVE ANY OTHER PERSON I EVER KNEW
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO HAVE POSSESSED AS THE BROTHER OF MY HEART I SHALL CONTINUE MY JOURNAL CONCERNING THE STRANGER AT INTERVALS SHOULD I HAVE ANY FRESH INCIDENTS TO RECORD AUGUST THIRTEENTH
YOU HAVE BEEN TUTORED AND REFINED BY BOOKS AND RETIREMENT FROM THE WORLD AND YOU ARE THEREFORE SOMEWHAT FASTIDIOUS BUT THIS ONLY RENDERS YOU THE MORE FIT TO APPRECIATE THE EXTRAORDINARY MERITS OF THIS WONDERFUL MAN SOMETIMES
BUT HE BESTOWED THE WHOLE ON HIS RIVAL TOGETHER WITH THE REMAINS OF HIS PRIZE MONEY TO PURCHASE STOCK AND THEN HIMSELF SOLICITED THE YOUNG WOMAN'S FATHER TO CONSENT TO HER MARRIAGE WITH HER LOVER
BUT JUST AT THAT TIME I INHERITED THE FORTUNE OF MY COUSIN AND MY THOUGHTS WERE TURNED INTO THE CHANNEL OF THEIR EARLIER BENT SIX YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE I RESOLVED ON MY PRESENT UNDERTAKING
INSPIRITED BY THIS WIND OF PROMISE MY DAYDREAMS BECOME MORE FERVENT AND VIVID I TRY IN VAIN TO BE PERSUADED THAT THE POLE IS THE SEAT OF FROST AND DESOLATION IT EVER PRESENTS ITSELF TO MY IMAGINATION AS THE REGION OF BEAUTY AND DELIGHT
AND THOSE BRANCHES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE FROM WHICH A NAVAL ADVENTURER MIGHT DERIVE THE GREATEST PRACTICAL ADVANTAGE TWICE I ACTUALLY HIRED MYSELF AS AN UNDER MATE IN A GREENLAND WHALER AND ACQUITTED MYSELF TO ADMIRATION
BUT BESIDES THIS THERE IS A LOVE FOR THE MARVELLOUS A BELIEF IN THE MARVELLOUS INTERTWINED IN ALL MY PROJECTS WHICH HURRIES ME OUT OF THE COMMON PATHWAYS OF MEN
BUT THE SPRING PROMISES WELL AND IT IS CONSIDERED AS A REMARKABLY EARLY SEASON SO THAT PERHAPS I MAY SAIL SOONER THAN I EXPECTED I SHALL DO NOTHING RASHLY YOU KNOW ME SUFFICIENTLY TO CONFIDE IN MY PRUDENCE AND CONSIDERATENESS
DO I NOT DESERVE TO ACCOMPLISH SOME GREAT PURPOSE MY LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN EASE AND LUXURY BUT I PREFERRED GLORY TO EVERY ENTICEMENT THAT WEALTH PLACED IN MY PATH
I FELT MYSELF PECULIARLY FORTUNATE IN BEING ABLE TO SECURE HIS SERVICES I HEARD OF HIM FIRST IN RATHER A ROMANTIC MANNER FROM A LADY WHO OWES TO HIM THE HAPPINESS OF HER LIFE THIS BRIEFLY IS HIS STORY
BUT APPARENTLY OF GIGANTIC STATURE SAT IN THE SLEDGE AND GUIDED THE DOGS WE WATCHED THE RAPID PROGRESS OF THE TRAVELLER WITH OUR TELESCOPES UNTIL HE WAS LOST AMONG THE DISTANT INEQUALITIES OF THE ICE
BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN MY FRIEND IF THUS YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO NAME YOU NOTHING CAN ALTER MY DESTINY LISTEN TO MY HISTORY AND YOU WILL PERCEIVE HOW IRREVOCABLY
THIS APPEARANCE EXCITED OUR UNQUALIFIED WONDER WE WERE AS WE BELIEVED MANY HUNDRED MILES FROM ANY LAND BUT THIS APPARITION SEEMED TO DENOTE THAT IT WAS NOT IN REALITY SO DISTANT AS WE HAD SUPPOSED
STRANGE AN ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED TO US THAT I CANNOT FORBEAR RECORDING IT ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT YOU WILL SEE ME BEFORE THESE PAPERS CAN COME INTO YOUR POSSESSION LAST MONDAY JULY THIRTY FIRST WE WERE NEARLY SURROUNDED BY ICE
ALTHOUGH WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT BEFORE I COME ON BOARD YOUR VESSEL SAID HE WILL YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS TO INFORM ME WHITHER YOU ARE BOUND YOU MAY CONCEIVE MY ASTONISHMENT ON HEARING SUCH A QUESTION ADDRESSED TO ME
HE IS MADLY DESIROUS OF GLORY OR RATHER TO WORD MY PHRASE MORE CHARACTERISTICALLY OF ADVANCEMENT IN HIS PROFESSION HE IS AN ENGLISHMAN AND IN THE MIDST OF NATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL PREJUDICES
FAREWELL MY DEAR EXCELLENT MARGARET HEAVEN SHOWER DOWN BLESSINGS ON YOU AND SAVE ME THAT I MAY AGAIN AND AGAIN TESTIFY MY GRATITUDE FOR ALL YOUR LOVE AND KINDNESS YOUR AFFECTIONATE BROTHER
SUCH A MAN HAS A DOUBLE EXISTENCE HE MAY SUFFER MISERY AND BE OVERWHELMED BY DISAPPOINTMENTS YET WHEN HE HAS RETIRED INTO HIMSELF HE WILL BE LIKE A CELESTIAL SPIRIT THAT HAS A HALO AROUND HIM
HEAR ME LET ME REVEAL MY TALE AND YOU WILL DASH THE CUP FROM YOUR LIPS SUCH WORDS YOU MAY IMAGINE STRONGLY EXCITED MY CURIOSITY
HOW GLADLY I WOULD SACRIFICE MY FORTUNE MY EXISTENCE MY EVERY HOPE TO THE FURTHERANCE OF MY ENTERPRISE ONE MAN'S LIFE OR DEATH WERE BUT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR THE ACQUIREMENT OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I SOUGHT FOR THE DOMINION
IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY COURAGE AND MY RESOLUTION IS FIRM BUT MY HOPES FLUCTUATE AND MY SPIRITS ARE OFTEN DEPRESSED I AM ABOUT TO PROCEED ON A LONG AND DIFFICULT VOYAGE THE EMERGENCIES OF WHICH WILL DEMAND ALL MY FORTITUDE
BUT TO RETURN TO DEARER CONSIDERATIONS SHALL I MEET YOU AGAIN AFTER HAVING TRAVERSED IMMENSE SEAS
AND WHO WAS KNOWN TO HAVE FREE ACCESS TO MAJESTY SHOULD BE FREQUENTLY IMPORTUNED TO USE HIS INFLUENCE FOR PURPOSES WHICH A RIGID MORALITY MUST CONDEMN THE INTEGRITY OF PENN HAD STOOD FIRM AGAINST OBLOQUY AND PERSECUTION
THESE CALUMNIES INDEED COULD FIND CREDIT ONLY WITH THE UNDISCERNING MULTITUDE BUT WITH THESE CALUMNIES WERE MINGLED ACCUSATIONS MUCH BETTER FOUNDED
THUS THE TWO EXTREME SECTS PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY WERE EXTREME SECTS HAD A COMMON INTEREST DISTINCT FROM THE INTEREST OF THE INTERMEDIATE SECTS THE QUAKERS WERE ALSO GUILTLESS OF ALL OFFENCE AGAINST JAMES AND HIS HOUSE
IT IS EVIDENT THAT A BODY OF MEN SO RAW AND INEXPERIENCED MUST HAVE BEEN IN SOME IMPORTANT QUALITIES
GUILDFORD HAD RECOMMENDED SIR THOMAS MERES WHO LIKE HIMSELF RANKED AMONG THE TRIMMERS JEFFREYS WHO MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY OF CROSSING THE LORD KEEPER
WHICH HE OUGHT TO HAVE HELD SACRED NOR WAS HIS RECTITUDE ALTOGETHER PROOF AGAINST THE TEMPTATIONS TO WHICH IT WAS EXPOSED IN THAT SPLENDID AND POLITE BUT DEEPLY CORRUPTED SOCIETY
AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS DISPOSED TO ACCEPT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THEM A PENAL LAW AGAINST EXCLUSIONISTS SUCH A LAW INDEED WOULD HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY UNPLEASING TO HIM
TO OPULENCE AND ILLUSTRIOUS DESCENT MUST BE HIGHLY CONSIDERED BUT IN A HOUSE OF COMMONS FROM WHICH MANY OF THE MOST EMINENT ORATORS AND PARLIAMENTARY TACTICIANS OF THE AGE WERE EXCLUDED
THUS WAS SCOTLAND GOVERNED BY THAT PRINCE WHOM IGNORANT MEN HAVE REPRESENTED AS A FRIEND OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WHOSE MISFORTUNE IT WAS TO BE TOO WISE AND TOO GOOD FOR THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED
WITHOUT MOLESTATION TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE LATE REIGN HE HAD OBTAINED IN SATISFACTION OF AN OLD DEBT DUE TO HIM FROM THE CROWN
IN WHICH HE SHOWED A GENEROUS COMPASSION TO THOSE WHO HAD OPPOSED HIM HONESTLY AND ON PUBLIC GROUNDS BUT HE FREQUENTLY SPARED AND PROMOTED THOSE WHOM SOME VILE MOTIVE HAD INDUCED TO INJURE HIM
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC AND THE QUAKER DIFFER MOST WIDELY IT MAY SEEM PARADOXICAL TO SAY THAT THIS VERY CIRCUMSTANCE CONSTITUTED A TIE BETWEEN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC AND THE QUAKER YET SUCH WAS REALLY THE CASE
AND WHICH HAD CHANGED WITH THE CHANGE OF FORTUNE JAMES JUSTLY REGARDED THESE RENEGADES AS THE MOST SERVICEABLE TOOLS THAT HE COULD EMPLOY IT WAS NOT FROM THE STOUTHEARTED CAVALIERS
AND HE COULD THEREFORE SAFELY VENTURE TO HOLD LANGUAGE FOR WHICH ANY PERSON SUSPECTED OF REPUBLICANISM WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE TOWER HE HAD LONG BEEN AT THE HEAD OF A STRONG PARLIAMENTARY CONNECTION
FOR THEY WERE ALL READY TO CALL GOD TO WITNESS THAT THEY RENOUNCED ALL SPIRITUAL CONNECTION WITH FOREIGN PRELATES AND POTENTATES BUT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC WOULD NOT SWEAR THAT THE POPE HAD NO JURISDICTION IN ENGLAND AND THE QUAKER WOULD NOT SWEAR TO ANYTHING
DURING SEVERAL GENERATIONS NONE BUT LAWYERS HAD BEEN CALLED TO THE CHAIR AND HE WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WHOSE ABILITIES AND ACQUIREMENTS HAD ENABLED HIM TO BREAK THAT LONG PRESCRIPTION
AND OF WHOSE LOYALTY CERTIFICATES HAD BEEN PRODUCED TO THE GOVERNMENT THESE PERSONS WERE DISCHARGED AND ORDERS WERE GIVEN THAT NO SIMILAR PROCEEDING SHOULD BE INSTITUTED TILL THE ROYAL PLEASURE SHOULD BE FURTHER SIGNIFIED
INDUCED HIM TO FORM THE DESIGN OF UNITING PURITANS AND PAPISTS IN A COALITION FOR THE HUMILIATION AND SPOLIATION OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH ONE SECT OF PROTESTANT DISSENTERS INDEED HE
ENGLAND IS PROUD OF HIS NAME A GREAT COMMONWEALTH BEYOND THE ATLANTIC REGARDS HIM WITH A REVERENCE SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH THE ATHENIANS FELT FOR THESEUS AND THE ROMANS FOR QUIRINUS
WITH THE FASHIONS OF THE WORLD UNHAPPILY IT CANNOT BE CONCEALED THAT HE BORE A CHIEF PART IN SOME TRANSACTIONS CONDEMNED NOT MERELY BY THE RIGID CODE OF THE SOCIETY TO WHICH HE BELONGED BUT BY THE GENERAL SENSE OF ALL HONEST MEN
BUT HIS WRITINGS AND HIS LIFE FURNISH ABUNDANT PROOFS THAT HE WAS NOT A MAN OF STRONG SENSE HE HAD NO SKILL IN READING THE CHARACTERS OF OTHERS
MEANWHILE ADMIRERS OF A VERY DIFFERENT SORT HAVE SOUNDED HIS PRAISES THE FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PARDONED WHAT THEY REGARDED AS HIS SUPERSTITIOUS FANCIES
OR SHOOT POOR COUNTRYMEN FOR DOUBTING WHETHER HE WAS ONE OF THE ELECT YET EVEN IN ENGLAND HE CONTINUED TO PERSECUTE THE PURITANS AS FAR AS HIS POWER EXTENDED TILL EVENTS WHICH WILL HEREAFTER BE RELATED
THEY ALSO EVEN IN DOMESTIC PRIVACY AVOIDED ON PRINCIPLE ALL POLITICAL CONVERSATION FOR SUCH CONVERSATION WAS IN THEIR OPINION UNFAVOURABLE TO THEIR SPIRITUALITY OF MIND
A LAW WAS IN FORCE WHICH IMPOSED SEVERE PENALTIES ON EVERY PERSON WHO REFUSED TO TAKE THE OATH OF SUPREMACY WHEN REQUIRED TO DO SO THIS LAW DID NOT AFFECT PRESBYTERIANS INDEPENDENTS OR BAPTISTS
IN CONSIDERATION OF HIS CONTEMPT FOR PRIESTS AND OF HIS COSMOPOLITAN BENEVOLENCE IMPARTIALLY EXTENDED TO ALL RACES AND TO ALL CREEDS HIS NAME HAS THUS BECOME
BUT NOW ATTACKED BY ROYAL SMILES BY FEMALE BLANDISHMENTS BY THE INSINUATING ELOQUENCE AND DELICATE FLATTERY OF VETERAN DIPLOMATISTS AND COURTIERS HIS RESOLUTION BEGAN TO GIVE WAY
HE AFTERWARDS SOLEMNLY PROTESTED THAT HIS HANDS WERE PURE FROM ILLICIT GAIN AND THAT HE HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY GRATUITY FROM THOSE WHOM HE HAD
PASTURES NEW STEVE HAD ARRIVED AT THE CONNECTICUT SHACK IN THE EARLY DAWN OF THE DAY WHICH HAD BEEN SO EVENTFUL TO MOST OF HIS FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WILLIAM BANNISTER'S INTEREST IN THE DRIVE AT FIRST ACUTE
FROM WHICH THE STOPPING OF THE CAR DID NOT AWAKEN HIM STEVE JUMPED DOWN AND STRETCHED HIMSELF THERE WAS A WONDERFUL FRESHNESS IN THE AIR WHICH MADE HIM FORGET FOR A MOMENT HIS DESIRE FOR REPOSE HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM BREATHING DEEP DRAUGHTS OF ITS COOLNESS
NO PAPER REPEATED THE WHITE HOPE FIRMLY STEVE REGARDED HIM THOUGHTFULLY I DIDN'T HAVE THIS TRIP PLANNED OUT RIGHT HE SAID REGRETFULLY I OUGHT TO HAVE GOT MAMIE TO COME ALONG
HE CLIMBED IN AND UNLOCKED THE FRONT DOOR THEN HE CARRIED HIS YOUNG CHARGE INTO THE SITTING ROOM AND LAID HIM DOWN ON A CHAIR
AND MAIDS TO DO ONE'S HAIR SHE HATED THE CHEAP FURNITURE OF THE LITTLE PARLOUR THE PENETRATING CONTRALTO OF THE COOK SINGING HYMNS IN THE KITCHEN AND THE UBIQUITOUSNESS OF HER SMALL BROTHER HE WAS ONLY TEN AND SMALL FOR HIS AGE
COME IN TO TRADE WITH THE ZION MERCANTILE CO OPERATIVE INSTITUTE THE CHURCH I FANCY LOOKS AFTER THE FINANCES OF THIS THING AND IT CONSEQUENTLY PAYS GOOD DIVIDENDS THE FACES OF THE WOMEN WERE NOT LOVELY IN DEED
AND WE WAS VERY POOR NOW WE'RE BETTER OFF MY FATHER AN MOTHER AN ME THEN YOU LIKE THE STATE SHE MISUNDERSTOOD AT FIRST OH I AIN'T LIVIN IN THE STATE OF POLYGAMY NOT ME YET I AIN'T MARRIED I LIKE WHERE I AM
FOR THE LAST PERSON ROSCOE SHERRIFF HANDLED AN EMOTIONAL ACTRESS NAMED DEVENISH HAD TO KEEP A YOUNG PUMA BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE END OF IT WAS THAT HE RANG OFF
AND ON SUNDAY GO TO THE PRAYING PLACE I TRIED TO TALK TO A FEW OF THEM BUT THEY SPOKE STRANGE TONGUES AND STARED AND BEHAVED LIKE COWS YET ONE WOMAN AND NOT AN ALTOGETHER UGLY ONE
WHILE MAMIE IN A COTTON FROCK CALLED CHEERFULLY TO HIM TO COME IN BECAUSE BREAKFAST WAS READY AND GETTING COLD MAMIE AH HIS SIGH TURNED INTO A YAWN
THEY LIVE IN THE COTTAGE BY THE BIG HOUSE YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THEM TREES HIS POP LOOKS AFTER MISTER WILSON'S PRIZE DAWGS THAT'S HIS JOB WHAT'S WILSON ASKED THE WHITE HOPE COMING OUT OF HIS STUPOR
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IT MEANS THAT HE'S BEHAVING LIKE A PERFECT PIG I HARDLY KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN WELL IT WAS THIS WAY DIRECTLY I MADE MY HIT MY PRESS AGENT A REAL BRIGHT MAN NAMED SHERRIFF GOT BUSY OF COURSE INTERVIEWS YOU KNOW
THE ROBINS WHICH THOUGH NOT SO WELL ADVERTISED RISE JUST AS PUNCTUALLY AS THE LARK WERE BEGINNING TO SING AS THEY MADE THEIR SIMPLE TOILETS BEFORE SETTING OUT TO ATTEND TO THE EARLY WORM
AND NOW IT'S PICTURES I DON'T MIND HIS PAINTING IT GIVES HIM SOMETHING TO DO AND KEEPS HIM OUT OF MISCHIEF HE HAS A STUDIO DOWN IN WASHINGTON SQUARE AND IS PERFECTLY HAPPY MESSING ABOUT THERE ALL DAY EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE IF HE DIDN'T THINK IT NECESSARY
AND WE'LL SCARE UP SOME BREAKFAST STEVE'S IGNORANCE OF THE LOCALITY IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF WAS COMPLETE BUT HE HAD A GENERAL IMPRESSION THAT FARMERS AS A CLASS WERE PEOPLE WHO DELIGHTED IN PROVIDING BREAKFASTS FOR THE NEEDY IF THE NEEDY POSSESSED THE NECESSARY PRICE
IT OUGHT TO MAKE THE FINEST SCIENTIFIC AND SURVEY CORPS THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN IT DOES EXCELLENT WORK NOW BUT THERE IS THIS DEFECT IN ITS NATURE IT IS OFFICERED AS YOU KNOW FROM WEST POINT THE MISCHIEF OF IT IS
OF COURSE IT'S THE TITLE THAT DOES IT LADY PAULINE WETHERBY ALGIE SAYS IT OUGHTN'T TO BE THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT THE DAUGHTER OF A DUKE
THE BOND BETWEEN THE STATES IS OF AN AMAZING TENUITY SO LONG AS THEY DO NOT ABSOLUTELY MARCH INTO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SIT ON THE WASHINGTON STATUES AND INVENT A FLAG OF THEIR OWN
WITH A DEEP SIGH OF REPLETION STEVE MEANWHILE HAD ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SAY
WILLIAM BANNISTER MADE NO MORE OBJECTIONS HE ATTACKED HIS MEAL WITH AN EASY CONSCIENCE
POLLY MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SHE REFLECTED BITTERLY SHE TOOK THE LETTER UP AGAIN AND SAW THAT ON THE LAST PAGE THERE WAS A POSTSCRIPT P S I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU ARE FIXED FOR MONEY OLD GIRL
BECAUSE HE IS A HIDEOUSLY VERSATILE AMERICAN TO BEGIN WITH
ROUND WHICH THE MILITIA OF THE COUNTRY WILL RALLY AND FROM WHICH THEY WILL GET A STIFFENING IN TIME OF DANGER YET OTHER PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT THE ARMY SHOULD BE BUILT LIKE A PAIR OF LAZY TONGS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF ELASTICITY AND EXTENSION
SURE I HAVE SAID THE HOSTESS PROUDLY
COULD DRIVE THE HULKING BOARD FACED MEN INTO IT THE WOMEN WORE HIDEOUS GARMENTS AND THE MEN APPEARED TO BE TIED UP WITH STRINGS
I THOUGHT FROM THE WAY YOU SPOKE HE WAS A REGULAR KID KNOW ANY ONE IN THESE PARTS WHO'S GOT SOMETHING ABOUT THE SAME WEIGHT AS THIS ONE THE FARMER'S WIFE REFLECTED KIDS IS PRETTY SCARCE ROUND HERE SHE SAID I RECKON YOU WON'T GET ONE THAT I KNOWS OF
AND THIS WAS HER FIRST LETTER POLLY HAD A WARM HEART AND DID NOT FORGET HER FRIENDS BUT SHE WAS NOT A GOOD CORRESPONDENT THE NEED OF GETTING HER THINGS READY AT ONCE DROVE THE LETTER FROM CLAIRE'S MIND SHE WAS IN THE TRAIN ON HER WAY TO SOUTHAMPTON
AND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS GROWING LESS ARDUOUS YEAR BY YEAR B INTERNAL RIOTS AND COMMOTIONS WHICH RISE UP LIKE A DUST DEVIL WHIRL FURIOUSLY AND DIE OUT LONG BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES AT WASHINGTON COULD BEGIN TO FILL UP EVEN THE THIRD SKELETON BATTALIONS
AND TALKING ABOUT A LADY WETHERBY TEN MINUTES LATER HER PASSAGE SECURED CLAIRE WAS WALKING TO THE LOCAL THEATRE TO INFORM THOSE IN CHARGE OF THE DESTINIES OF THE GIRL AND THE ARTIST NUMBER ONE COMPANY THAT THEY MUST LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR A SUBSTITUTE FOR MISS CLAUDIA WINSLOW
IT'S THE ELDERS BUSINESS AN BETWEEN YOU AN ME I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING ON MUCH LONGER
WHAT RIGHT HAD LORD DAWLISH TO LOOK DOWN HIS NOSE AND MURMUR
WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT PAPER AUNTY LORA SAYS NOT TO EAT BREAD THAT DOESN'T COME WRAPPED UP IN PAPER SAID THE WHITE HOPE BECOMING SURPRISINGLY LUCID MAMIE UNDOES IT OUT OF CRINKLY PAPER I GET YOU
USE TO ASCRIBE THEM TO PROVIDENCE AND FORTUNE FOR SO THEY MAY THE BETTER ASSUME THEM AND BESIDES IT IS GREATNESS IN A MAN TO BE THE CARE OF THE HIGHER POWERS SO CAESAR SAID TO THE PILOT IN THE TEMPEST
YET THEIR THOUGHTS DO END WITH THEMSELVES AND ACCOUNT FUTURE TIMES IMPERTINENCES NAY THERE ARE SOME OTHER THAT ACCOUNT WIFE AND CHILDREN BUT AS BILLS OF CHARGES NAY MORE
SAILED THE LENGTH OF THE GREAT OCEAN IN AN EARTHEN POT OR PITCHER LIVELY DESCRIBING CHRISTIAN RESOLUTION THAT SAILETH IN THE FRAIL BARK OF THE FLESH THROUGH THE WAVES OF THE WORLD BUT TO SPEAK IN A MEAN
IN SUCH A COMPANY AS THERE IS STEAM AND HEAT THINGS OF GREAT PLEASURE AND REFRESHMENT DOUBLE MASQUES ONE OF MEN ANOTHER OF LADIES ADDETH STATE AND VARIETY BUT ALL IS NOTHING EXCEPT THE ROOM BE KEPT CLEAR AND NEAT
PLACED ALOFT AND ACCOMPANIED WITH SOME BROKEN MUSIC AND THE DITTY FITTED TO THE DEVICE ACTING IN SONG ESPECIALLY IN DIALOGUES HATH AN EXTREME GOOD GRACE I SAY ACTING NOT DANCING
SEVERAL QUIRES PLACED ONE OVER AGAINST ANOTHER AND TAKING THE VOICE BY CATCHES ANTHEM WISE GIVE GREAT PLEASURE TURNING DANCES INTO FIGURE IS A CHILDISH CURIOSITY AND GENERALLY LET IT BE NOTED
REVENGE IS A KIND OF WILD JUSTICE WHICH THE MORE MAN'S NATURE RUNS TO THE MORE OUGHT LAW TO WEED IT OUT FOR AS FOR THE FIRST WRONG IT DOTH BUT OFFEND THE LAW
FOR SOLDIERS I FIND THE GENERALS COMMONLY IN THEIR HORTATIVES PUT MEN IN MIND OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN AND I THINK THE DESPISING OF MARRIAGE AMONGST THE TURKS MAKETH THE VULGAR SOLDIER MORE BASE
HAVE SOME MOTIONS UPON THE SCENE ITSELF BEFORE THEIR COMING DOWN FOR IT DRAWS THE EYE STRANGELY AND MAKES IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE TO DESIRE TO SEE THAT IT CANNOT PERFECTLY DISCERN
FOR HIS THOUGHTS WILL FLY TO IT OF THEMSELVES SO AS THE SPACES OF OTHER BUSINESS OR STUDIES WILL SUFFICE A MAN'S NATURE RUNS EITHER TO HERBS OR WEEDS THEREFORE
NEITHER IS THE ANCIENT RULE AMISS TO BEND NATURE AS A WAND TO A CONTRARY EXTREME WHEREBY TO SET IT RIGHT UNDERSTANDING IT WHERE THE CONTRARY EXTREME IS NO VICE
THEREFORE LET A MAN EITHER AVOID THE OCCASION ALTOGETHER OR PUT HIMSELF OFTEN TO IT THAT HE MAY BE LITTLE MOVED WITH IT A MAN'S NATURE IS BEST PERCEIVED IN PRIVATENESS FOR THERE IS NO AFFECTATION
BUT THEN THEY WERE LIKE HORSES WELL MANAGED FOR THEY COULD TELL PASSING WELL WHEN TO STOP OR TURN AND AT SUCH TIMES WHEN THEY THOUGHT THE CASE INDEED REQUIRED DISSIMULATION IF THEN THEY USED IT IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE FORMER OPINION SPREAD ABROAD
NOT SO MUCH IN DOING THE HURT AS IN MAKING THE PARTY REPENT BUT BASE AND CRAFTY COWARDS ARE LIKE THE ARROW THAT FLIETH IN THE DARK
THIS WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER IN POESY WHERE TRANSCENDENCES ARE MORE ALLOWED AND THE POETS INDEED HAVE BEEN BUSY WITH IT FOR IT IS IN EFFECT THE THING WHICH FIGURED IN THAT STRANGE FICTION OF THE ANCIENT POETS
THE FORCE OF CUSTOM COPULATE AND CONJOINED AND COLLEGIATE IS FAR GREATER FOR THERE EXAMPLE TEACHETH COMPANY COMFORTETH EMULATION QUICKENETH GLORY RAISETH SO AS IN SUCH PLACES
OF THEIR GOOD FAITH AND CLEARNESS OF DEALING MADE THEM ALMOST INVISIBLE THERE BE THREE DEGREES OF THIS HIDING AND VEILING OF A MAN'S SELF THE FIRST CLOSENESS RESERVATION AND SECRECY
COSMUS DUKE OF FLORENCE HAD A DESPERATE SAYING AGAINST PERFIDIOUS OR NEGLECTING FRIENDS AS IF THOSE WRONGS WERE UNPARDONABLE YOU SHALL READ SAITH HE THAT WE ARE COMMANDED TO FORGIVE OUR ENEMIES
AND ANOTHER EXCEPT TO IT YEA BUT HE HATH A GREAT CHARGE OF CHILDREN AS IF IT WERE AN ABATEMENT TO HIS RICHES BUT THE MOST ORDINARY CAUSE OF A SINGLE LIFE IS LIBERTY
BY THE PLEASURE OF THE EYE CERTAINLY VIRTUE IS LIKE PRECIOUS ODORS MOST FRAGRANT WHEN THEY ARE INCENSED OR CRUSHED FOR PROSPERITY DOTH BEST DISCOVER VICE BUT ADVERSITY DOTH BEST DISCOVER VIRTUE
CERTAINLY THE ABLEST MEN THAT EVER WERE HAVE HAD ALL AN OPENNESS AND FRANKNESS OF DEALING
THAT SIMULATION AND DISSIMULATION COMMONLY CARRY WITH THEM A SHOW OF FEARFULNESS WHICH IN ANY BUSINESS DOTH SPOIL THE FEATHERS OF ROUND FLYING UP TO THE MARK THE SECOND THAT IT PUZZLETH AND PERPLEXETH THE CONCEITS OF MANY
FOR SO LIVY AFTER HE HAD DESCRIBED CATO MAJOR IN THESE WORDS
WHICH PRICK AND SCRATCH BECAUSE THEY CAN DO NO OTHER THE MOST TOLERABLE SORT OF REVENGE
THAT HE MIGHT BE HANGED IN A WITHE AND NOT IN AN HALTER BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SO USED WITH FORMER REBELS THERE BE MONKS IN RUSSIA FOR PENANCE THAT WILL SIT A WHOLE NIGHT IN A VESSEL OF WATER
THERE ARE SOME FOOLISH RICH COVETOUS MEN THAT TAKE A PRIDE IN HAVING NO CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY MAY BE THOUGHT SO MUCH THE RICHER FOR PERHAPS THEY HAVE HEARD SOME TALK SUCH AN ONE IS A GREAT RICH MAN
FOR WHERE A MAN'S INTENTIONS ARE PUBLISHED IT IS AN ALARUM TO CALL UP ALL THAT ARE AGAINST THEM THE SECOND IS TO RESERVE TO A MAN'S SELF A FAIR RETREAT FOR IF A MAN ENGAGE HIMSELF BY A MANIFEST DECLARATION
BUT MEMORY MERIT AND NOBLE WORKS ARE PROPER TO MEN AND SURELY A MAN SHALL SEE THE NOBLEST WORKS AND FOUNDATIONS HAVE PROCEEDED FROM CHILDLESS MEN WHICH HAVE SOUGHT TO EXPRESS THE IMAGES OF THEIR MINDS WHERE THOSE OF THEIR BODIES HAVE FAILED
OVER THAT ASPECT WE HUNG NOW ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE GREAT CIRCULAR PIT THE MARTIANS WERE ENGAGED IN MAKING THE HEAVY BEATING SOUND WAS EVIDENTLY JUST BEHIND US AND EVER AND AGAIN A BRIGHT GREEN VAPOUR DROVE UP LIKE A VEIL ACROSS OUR PEEPHOLE
AND SEEMED TO GO OUT OF THE CELLAR AGAIN FOR A MINUTE I WAS NOT SURE APPARENTLY IT HAD TAKEN A LUMP OF COAL TO EXAMINE I SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF SLIGHTLY SHIFTING MY POSITION WHICH HAD BECOME CRAMPED AND THEN LISTENED
AND TWISTING AND TURNING WITH QUEER SUDDEN MOVEMENTS THIS WAY AND THAT FOR A WHILE I STOOD FASCINATED BY THAT SLOW FITFUL ADVANCE THEN WITH A FAINT HOARSE CRY I FORCED MYSELF ACROSS THE SCULLERY I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY
THEN HE WOULD SUDDENLY REVERT TO THE MATTER OF THE FOOD I WITHHELD FROM HIM PRAYING BEGGING WEEPING AT LAST THREATENING HE BEGAN TO RAISE HIS VOICE I PRAYED HIM NOT TO HE PERCEIVED A HOLD ON ME
SINCE KNOWN TO BE ANATOMICALLY AN EAR THOUGH IT MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST USELESS
I HAD BEEN DOZING BUT IN AN INSTANT I WAS AWAKE ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT WE SAT FACE TO FACE I WEARY BUT RESOLUTE AND HE WEEPING AND COMPLAINING OF HIS IMMEDIATE HUNGER
BUT IT HAD A PAIR OF VERY LARGE DARK COLOURED EYES AND JUST BENEATH THIS A KIND OF FLESHY BEAK IN THE BACK OF THIS HEAD OR BODY I SCARCELY KNOW HOW TO SPEAK OF IT WAS THE SINGLE TIGHT TYMPANIC SURFACE
AND THE STUDY OF WHICH HAS ALREADY GIVEN SUCH AN ENORMOUS IMPETUS TO TERRESTRIAL INVENTION AS IT DAWNED UPON ME FIRST IT PRESENTED A SORT OF METALLIC SPIDER WITH FIVE JOINTED AGILE LEGS
JUST AS YOUNG LILYBULBS BUD OFF OR LIKE THE YOUNG ANIMALS IN THE FRESH WATER POLYP IN MAN IN ALL THE HIGHER TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS SUCH A METHOD OF INCREASE HAS DISAPPEARED BUT EVEN ON THIS EARTH IT WAS CERTAINLY THE PRIMITIVE METHOD
WITH ONE LAST TOUCH OF HUMANITY I TURNED THE BLADE BACK AND STRUCK HIM WITH THE BUTT HE WENT HEADLONG FORWARD AND LAY STRETCHED ON THE GROUND I STUMBLED OVER HIM AND STOOD PANTING HE LAY STILL SUDDENLY I HEARD A NOISE WITHOUT
IS PARTLY EXPLAINED BY THE NATURE OF THE REMAINS OF THE VICTIMS THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM AS PROVISIONS FROM MARS THESE CREATURES TO JUDGE FROM THE SHRIVELLED REMAINS THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO HUMAN HANDS WERE BIPEDS WITH FLIMSY SILICIOUS SKELETONS ALMOST LIKE THOSE OF THE SILICIOUS SPONGES
SOMETHING WAS MOVING TO AND FRO THERE VERY QUIETLY EVERY NOW AND THEN IT TAPPED AGAINST THE WALL OR STARTED ON ITS MOVEMENTS WITH A FAINT METALLIC RINGING LIKE THE MOVEMENTS OF KEYS ON A SPLIT RING
AND THEN A LONG METALLIC SNAKE OF TENTACLE CAME FEELING SLOWLY THROUGH THE HOLE I TURNED BY AN EFFORT STUMBLED OVER THE CURATE AND STOPPED AT THE SCULLERY DOOR THE TENTACLE WAS NOW SOME WAY TWO YARDS OR MORE IN THE ROOM
AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE STANDING LIKEWISE AND EXTENDING HIS ARMS SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD IS UPON ME IN THREE STRIDES HE WAS AT THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE KITCHEN
AND AS NOISELESSLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE DARKNESS AMONG THE FIREWOOD AND COAL THEREIN EVERY NOW AND THEN I PAUSED RIGID TO HEAR IF THE MARTIAN HAD THRUST ITS TENTACLES THROUGH THE OPENING AGAIN THEN THE FAINT METALLIC JINGLE RETURNED
AND IN THIS MATTER I AM CONVINCED AS FIRMLY AS I AM CONVINCED OF ANYTHING THAT THE MARTIANS INTERCHANGED THOUGHTS WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL INTERMEDIATION AND I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED OF THIS IN SPITE OF STRONG PRECONCEPTIONS BEFORE THE MARTIAN INVASION
HE THREATENED HE WOULD SHOUT AND BRING THE MARTIANS UPON US FOR A TIME THAT SCARED ME
SQUEAMISH AS I MAY SEEM I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO DESCRIBE WHAT I COULD NOT ENDURE EVEN TO CONTINUE WATCHING LET IT SUFFICE TO SAY BLOOD OBTAINED FROM A STILL LIVING ANIMAL IN MOST CASES FROM A HUMAN BEING WAS RUN DIRECTLY BY MEANS OF A LITTLE PIPETTE
MICRO ORGANISMS WHICH CAUSE SO MUCH DISEASE AND PAIN ON EARTH HAVE EITHER NEVER APPEARED UPON MARS OR MARTIAN SANITARY SCIENCE ELIMINATED THEM AGES AGO A HUNDRED DISEASES ALL THE FEVERS AND CONTAGIONS OF HUMAN LIFE CONSUMPTION CANCERS TUMOURS
IT SEEMS NOW AN INTERMINABLE LENGTH OF TIME AND SO OUR WIDENED INCOMPATIBILITY ENDED AT LAST IN OPEN CONFLICT FOR TWO VAST DAYS WE STRUGGLED IN UNDERTONES AND WRESTLING CONTESTS THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I BEAT AND KICKED HIM MADLY TIMES WHEN I CAJOLED AND PERSUADED HIM
OUR BODIES ARE HALF MADE UP OF GLANDS AND TUBES AND ORGANS OCCUPIED IN TURNING HETEROGENEOUS FOOD INTO BLOOD THE DIGESTIVE PROCESSES AND THEIR REACTION UPON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SAP OUR STRENGTH AND COLOUR OUR MINDS
INSTEAD OF KEEPING CLOSE TO ME AND TRYING TO OUST ME FROM THE SLIT THE CURATE HAD GONE BACK INTO THE SCULLERY I WAS STRUCK BY A SUDDEN THOUGHT I WENT BACK QUICKLY AND QUIETLY INTO THE SCULLERY IN THE DARKNESS I HEARD THE CURATE DRINKING
WITH THAT REALISATION MY INTEREST SHIFTED TO THOSE OTHER CREATURES THE REAL MARTIANS
IT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED THAT THEY COMMUNICATED BY SOUNDS AND TENTACULAR GESTICULATIONS THIS IS ASSERTED FOR INSTANCE IN THE ABLE BUT HASTILY COMPILED PAMPHLET WRITTEN EVIDENTLY BY SOMEONE NOT AN EYE WITNESS OF MARTIAN ACTIONS
FROM CERTAIN VAGUE MEMORIES I AM INCLINED TO THINK MY OWN MIND WANDERED AT TIMES I HAD STRANGE AND HIDEOUS DREAMS WHENEVER I SLEPT IT SOUNDS PARADOXICAL BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE WEAKNESS AND INSANITY OF THE CURATE WARNED ME BRACED ME AND KEPT ME A SANE MAN
OR HAS PREFERRED OTHER EXPEDIENTS TO ITS DEVELOPMENT AND NOT ONLY DID THE MARTIANS EITHER NOT KNOW OF WHICH IS INCREDIBLE OR ABSTAIN FROM THE WHEEL BUT IN THEIR APPARATUS SINGULARLY LITTLE USE IS MADE OF THE FIXED PIVOT OR RELATIVELY FIXED PIVOT WITH CIRCULAR MOTIONS THEREABOUT CONFINED
IT WAS IN THE OTHER ARTIFICIAL ADDITIONS TO THEIR BODILY RESOURCES THAT THEIR GREAT SUPERIORITY OVER MAN LAY WE MEN WITH OUR BICYCLES AND ROAD SKATES OUR LILIENTHAL SOARING MACHINES OUR GUNS AND STICKS AND SO FORTH ARE JUST IN THE BEGINNING OF THE EVOLUTION THAT THE MARTIANS HAVE WORKED OUT
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN THESE STRUCTURES AND HAVE ONLY THE ILL IMAGINED EFFORTS OF ARTISTS OR THE IMPERFECT DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH EYE WITNESSES AS MYSELF TO GO UPON SCARCELY REALISE THAT LIVING QUALITY I RECALL PARTICULARLY THE ILLUSTRATION
I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BECOME ANYTHING NEITHER SPITEFUL NOR KIND NEITHER A RASCAL NOR AN HONEST MAN NEITHER A HERO NOR AN INSECT NOW I AM LIVING OUT MY LIFE IN MY CORNER
PEOPLE DO PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THEIR DISEASES AND I DO MAY BE MORE THAN ANYONE WE WILL NOT DISPUTE IT MY CONTENTION WAS ABSURD BUT YET I AM FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT A GREAT DEAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS
HOW IS ENJOYMENT IN THIS TO BE EXPLAINED BUT I WILL EXPLAIN IT I WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT THAT IS WHY I HAVE TAKEN UP MY PEN I FOR INSTANCE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF AMOUR PROPRE
I I AM A SICK MAN I AM A SPITEFUL MAN I AM AN UNATTRACTIVE MAN I BELIEVE MY LIVER IS DISEASED HOWEVER I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT MY DISEASE
THE ANTITHESIS OF THE NORMAL MAN THAT IS THE MAN OF ACUTE CONSCIOUSNESS WHO HAS COME OF COURSE NOT OUT OF THE LAP OF NATURE BUT OUT OF A RETORT THIS IS ALMOST MYSTICISM GENTLEMEN BUT I SUSPECT THIS TOO
THAT THIS WAS PERHAPS MY NORMAL CONDITION BUT AT FIRST IN THE BEGINNING WHAT AGONIES I ENDURED IN THAT STRUGGLE I DID NOT BELIEVE IT WAS THE SAME WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL MY LIFE I HID THIS FACT ABOUT MYSELF AS A SECRET
LOOK AT IT WHICH WAY ONE WILL IT STILL TURNS OUT THAT I WAS ALWAYS THE MOST TO BLAME IN EVERYTHING AND WHAT IS MOST HUMILIATING OF ALL TO BLAME FOR NO FAULT OF MY OWN BUT SO TO SAY THROUGH THE LAWS OF NATURE
FOR COMPLICITY IN A RATHER MAD ATTEMPT TO RESCUE SOME PRISONERS FROM A POLICE VAN THE PLAN OF THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN TO SHOOT DOWN THE HORSES AND OVERPOWER THE ESCORT UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE POLICE CONSTABLES GOT SHOT TOO
AND HER SUPERIORITY WAS SERENE AND CORDIAL THREE GENERATIONS HAD ADMIRED HER INFINITELY AND THE LAST SHE WAS LIKELY TO SEE HAD PRONOUNCED HER A WONDERFUL WOMAN MEANTIME INTELLIGENT WITH A SORT OF LOFTY SIMPLICITY
IT MAY BE AN ACUTELY CONSCIOUS MOUSE YET IT IS A MOUSE
AND OF THE CONTEMPT SPAT UPON IT BY THE DIRECT MEN OF ACTION WHO STAND SOLEMNLY ABOUT IT AS JUDGES AND ARBITRATORS LAUGHING AT IT TILL THEIR HEALTHY SIDES ACHE OF COURSE THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR IT IS TO DISMISS ALL THAT WITH A WAVE OF ITS PAW AND
I KNOW ALL THAT BETTER THAN ALL THESE SAGE AND EXPERIENCED COUNSELLORS AND MONITORS BUT I AM REMAINING IN PETERSBURG I AM NOT GOING AWAY FROM PETERSBURG I AM NOT GOING AWAY BECAUSE ECH
THAT WAS MY WAY I WAS LYING WHEN I SAID JUST NOW THAT I WAS A SPITEFUL OFFICIAL I WAS LYING FROM SPITE I WAS SIMPLY AMUSING MYSELF WITH THE PETITIONERS AND WITH THE OFFICER AND IN REALITY I NEVER COULD BECOME SPITEFUL
BUT OF THE UPPISH ONES THERE WAS ONE OFFICER IN PARTICULAR I COULD NOT ENDURE HE SIMPLY WOULD NOT BE HUMBLE AND CLANKED HIS SWORD IN A DISGUSTING WAY I CARRIED ON A FEUD WITH HIM FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS OVER THAT SWORD AT LAST I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM
AND SO ON AND SO ON MERCIFUL HEAVENS BUT WHAT DO I CARE FOR THE LAWS OF NATURE AND ARITHMETIC WHEN FOR SOME REASON I DISLIKE THOSE LAWS AND THE FACT THAT TWICE TWO MAKES FOUR OF COURSE I CANNOT BREAK THROUGH THE WALL BY BATTERING MY HEAD AGAINST IT
IT IS A CASE OF TWICE TWO MAKES FOUR NATURE DOES NOT ASK YOUR PERMISSION SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR WISHES AND WHETHER YOU LIKE HER LAWS OR DISLIKE THEM YOU ARE BOUND TO ACCEPT HER AS SHE IS AND CONSEQUENTLY ALL HER CONCLUSIONS A WALL YOU SEE IS A WALL
THAT YOU NEVER COULD BECOME A DIFFERENT MAN THAT EVEN IF TIME AND FAITH WERE STILL LEFT YOU TO CHANGE INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT YOU WOULD MOST LIKELY NOT WISH TO CHANGE OR IF YOU DID WISH TO EVEN THEN YOU WOULD DO NOTHING
I COULD NOT HAVE REVENGED MYSELF ON ANY ONE FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE I SHOULD CERTAINLY NEVER HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO DO ANYTHING EVEN IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO WHY SHOULD I NOT HAVE MADE UP MY MIND
SINCE SHE JUDGED THEM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HER LOFTY POSITION INDEED HER SYMPATHIES WERE EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO A MAN OF THAT SORT SHE WAS NOT AN EXPLOITING CAPITALIST HERSELF SHE WAS AS IT WERE ABOVE THE PLAY OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
FOR EVEN IF IT WERE OWING TO THE LAWS OF NATURE IT IS INSULTING ALL THE SAME FINALLY EVEN IF I HAD WANTED TO BE ANYTHING BUT MAGNANIMOUS HAD DESIRED ON THE CONTRARY TO REVENGE MYSELF ON MY ASSAILANT
HE SMILED INNOCENTLY AT A TALL BRILLIANT GIRL WHOSE EYES MET HIS ACCIDENTALLY AND WENT OUT UNCONSCIOUS OF THE GLANCES FOLLOWING HIM ACROSS THE ROOM
YOU NEVER COULD GUESS WHOM YOU WERE LIKELY TO COME UPON BEING RECEIVED IN SEMI PRIVACY WITHIN THE FADED BLUE SILK AND GILT FRAME SCREEN MAKING A COSY NOOK FOR A COUCH AND A FEW ARM CHAIRS IN THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM WITH ITS HUM OF VOICES
BUT WHAT CAN A DECENT MAN SPEAK OF WITH MOST PLEASURE ANSWER OF HIMSELF
FIRST AS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS TAINTED WITH MEDIOCRITY AND NEXT AS BEING IN A WAY AN ADMISSION OF INFERIORITY AND BOTH WERE FRANKLY INCONCEIVABLE TO HER NATURE
THESE GENTLEMEN BELLOW THEIR LOUDEST LIKE BULLS THOUGH THIS LET US SUPPOSE DOES THEM THE GREATEST CREDIT YET AS I HAVE SAID ALREADY CONFRONTED WITH THE IMPOSSIBLE THEY SUBSIDE AT ONCE THE IMPOSSIBLE MEANS THE STONE WALL
TAUNTING MYSELF WITH THE SPITEFUL AND USELESS CONSOLATION THAT AN INTELLIGENT MAN CANNOT BECOME ANYTHING SERIOUSLY AND IT IS ONLY THE FOOL WHO BECOMES ANYTHING YES
I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHO IT IS PRECISELY THAT I AM MORTIFYING IN THIS CASE BY MY SPITE I AM PERFECTLY WELL AWARE THAT I CANNOT PAY OUT THE DOCTORS BY NOT CONSULTING THEM I KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE THAT BY ALL THIS I AM ONLY INJURING MYSELF AND NO ONE ELSE
THE SLOPES OF THE KNOLL AND ALL THE INSIDE OF THE STOCKADE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF TIMBER TO BUILD THE HOUSE AND WE COULD SEE BY THE STUMPS WHAT A FINE AND LOFTY GROVE HAD BEEN DESTROYED
AND YOU WON'T FORGET MY WORDS A PRECIOUS SIGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL SAY A PRECIOUS SIGHT MORE CONFIDENCE' AND THEN NIPS HIM AND HE PINCHED ME THE THIRD TIME WITH THE SAME AIR OF CLEVERNESS
THE SUN HAD JUST SET THE SEA BREEZE WAS RUSTLING AND TUMBLING IN THE WOODS AND RUFFLING THE GREY SURFACE OF THE ANCHORAGE THE TIDE TOO WAS FAR OUT AND GREAT TRACTS OF SAND LAY UNCOVERED THE AIR AFTER THE HEAT OF THE DAY
SILVER'S EMBASSY SURE ENOUGH THERE WERE TWO MEN JUST OUTSIDE THE STOCKADE ONE OF THEM WAVING A WHITE CLOTH THE OTHER NO LESS A PERSON THAN SILVER HIMSELF STANDING PLACIDLY BY
SEVERELY WOUNDED IF HE WERE NOT DEAD EVERY TIME WE HAD A CRACK AT THEM WE WERE TO TAKE IT
WHY SILVER SAID THE CAPTAIN IF YOU HAD PLEASED TO BE AN HONEST MAN YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SITTING IN YOUR GALLEY IT'S YOUR OWN DOING YOU'RE EITHER MY SHIP'S COOK AND THEN YOU WERE TREATED HANDSOME OR CAP'N SILVER
SAID CAPTAIN SMOLLETT I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DESIRE TO TALK TO YOU IF YOU WISH TO TALK TO ME YOU CAN COME THAT'S ALL IF THERE'S ANY TREACHERY IT'LL BE ON YOUR SIDE AND THE LORD HELP YOU
CHILLED ME THROUGH MY JACKET THE HISPANIOLA STILL LAY WHERE SHE HAD ANCHORED BUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS THE JOLLY ROGER THE BLACK FLAG OF PIRACY FLYING FROM HER PEAK EVEN AS I LOOKED THERE CAME ANOTHER RED FLASH
THAT'S AS MAY BE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN
BUT CAPTAIN SMOLLETT WAS NEVER THE MAN FOR THAT ALL HANDS WERE CALLED UP BEFORE HIM AND HE DIVIDED US INTO WATCHES THE DOCTOR AND GRAY AND I FOR ONE THE SQUIRE HUNTER AND JOYCE UPON THE OTHER
BUT SILVER LAUGHED AT HIM ALOUD AND SLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK AS IF THE IDEA OF ALARM HAD BEEN ABSURD THEN HE ADVANCED TO THE STOCKADE THREW OVER HIS CRUTCH GOT A LEG UP
WHY IN A PLACE LIKE THIS WHERE NOBODY PUTS IN BUT GEN'LEMEN OF FORTUNE SILVER WOULD FLY THE JOLLY ROGER YOU DON'T MAKE NO DOUBT OF THAT NO THAT'S YOUR FRIENDS THERE'S BEEN BLOWS TOO AND I RECKON YOUR FRIENDS HAS HAD THE BEST OF IT
DOCTOR HERE'S MY SERVICE WHY
THAT'S FOR BEN GUNN BEFORE SUPPER WAS EATEN WE BURIED OLD TOM IN THE SAND AND STOOD ROUND HIM FOR A WHILE BARE HEADED IN THE BREEZE A GOOD DEAL OF FIREWOOD HAD BEEN GOT IN BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR THE CAPTAIN'S FANCY
THE DOCTOR STAKED HIS WIG THAT CAMPED WHERE THEY WERE IN THE MARSH AND UNPROVIDED WITH REMEDIES
OR SHOREWARD SIDE OF THE STOCKADE AND WAS SOON WARMLY WELCOMED BY THE FAITHFUL PARTY I HAD SOON TOLD MY STORY AND BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT ME THE LOG HOUSE WAS MADE OF UNSQUARED TRUNKS OF PINE
I ANSWERED WELL JIM SAYS HE
IT APPEARS THEY WERE AT THEIR WITS END WHAT TO DO THE STORES BEING SO LOW THAT WE MUST HAVE BEEN STARVED INTO SURRENDER LONG BEFORE HELP CAME BUT OUR BEST HOPE IT WAS DECIDED WAS TO KILL OFF THE BUCCANEERS
A MAN WHO HAS BEEN THREE YEARS BITING HIS NAILS ON A DESERT ISLAND JIM CAN'T EXPECT TO APPEAR AS SANE AS YOU OR ME IT DOESN'T LIE IN HUMAN NATURE WAS IT CHEESE YOU SAID HE HAD A FANCY FOR YES SIR CHEESE
SHOULD ANY BE INTENDED HE TURNED AND SPOKE TO US DOCTOR'S WATCH ON THE LOOKOUT
SOME OF MY HANDS BEING ROUGH AND HAVING OLD SCORES ON ACCOUNT OF HAZING
THE POOR JOLLY BOAT I AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED AWAY NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER A GREAT FIRE WAS GLOWING AMONG THE TREES AND BETWEEN THAT POINT AND THE SHIP ONE OF THE GIGS KEPT COMING AND GOING THE MEN
REFUSE THAT AND YOU'VE SEEN THE LAST OF ME BUT MUSKET BALLS VERY GOOD SAID THE CAPTAIN NOW YOU'LL HEAR ME IF YOU'LL COME UP ONE BY ONE UNARMED
AND HERE THEY ARE ASHORE IN THE OLD STOCKADE AS WAS MADE YEARS AND YEARS AGO BY FLINT AH HE WAS THE MAN TO HAVE A HEADPIECE WAS FLINT BARRING RUM HIS MATCH WERE NEVER SEEN HE WERE AFRAID OF NONE NOT HE
WHOM HE SALUTED IN THE HANDSOMEST STYLE HE WAS TRICKED OUT IN HIS BEST AN IMMENSE BLUE COAT THICK WITH BRASS BUTTONS HUNG AS LOW AS TO HIS KNEES
AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN WELL THEN STILL HOLDING ME I RECKON YOU CAN GO JIM AND JIM IF YOU WAS TO SEE SILVER YOU WOULDN'T GO FOR TO SELL BEN GUNN
HE CRIED THIS TIME IT WAS THE OTHER MAN WHO REPLIED CAP'N SILVER SIR TO COME ON BOARD AND MAKE TERMS HE SHOUTED
WELL HERE IT IS SAID SILVER WE WANT THAT TREASURE AND WE'LL HAVE IT THAT'S OUR POINT YOU WOULD JUST AS SOON SAVE YOUR LIVES I RECKON AND THAT'S YOURS YOU HAVE A CHART HAVEN'T YOU
IS THIS BEN GUNN A MAN HE ASKED I DO NOT KNOW SIR SAID I I AM NOT VERY SURE WHETHER HE'S SANE
I MOVED FROM HIDING PLACE TO HIDING PLACE ALWAYS PURSUED OR SO IT SEEMED TO ME BY THESE TERRIFYING MISSILES BUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE BOMBARDMENT
AND WHEN BEN GUNN IS WANTED YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM JIM
SHOUTED LONG JOHN CHEERILY
NOW RESUMED SILVER HERE IT IS YOU GIVE US THE CHART TO GET THE TREASURE BY
I SLEPT LIKE A LOG OF WOOD THE REST HAD LONG BEEN UP AND HAD ALREADY BREAKFASTED AND INCREASED THE PILE OF FIREWOOD BY ABOUT HALF AS MUCH AGAIN WHEN I WAS WAKENED BY A BUSTLE AND THE SOUND OF VOICES FLAG OF TRUCE
HOW BLITHELY SHE SANG THAT EVENING AND HOW THEY ALL LAUGHED AT HER BECAUSE SHE WOKE AMY IN THE NIGHT BY PLAYING THE PIANO ON HER FACE IN HER SLEEP
AMY COPIED PICTURES AND ENJOYED BEAUTY TO HER HEART'S CONTENT AND LAURIE PLAYED LORD OF THE MANOR IN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL STYLE BUT BETH THOUGH YEARNING FOR THE GRAND PIANO COULD NOT PLUCK UP COURAGE TO GO TO THE MANSION OF BLISS AS MEG CALLED IT SHE WENT ONCE WITH JO
AND THE SERVANTS ARE NEVER NEAR THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER NINE O'CLOCK HERE HE ROSE AS IF GOING AND BETH MADE UP HER MIND TO SPEAK FOR THAT LAST ARRANGEMENT LEFT NOTHING TO BE DESIRED
IF I WASN'T TOO OLD FOR SUCH THINGS I'D RATHER LIKE TO PLAY IT OVER AGAIN SAID AMY WHO BEGAN TO TALK OF RENOUNCING CHILDISH THINGS AT THE MATURE AGE OF TWELVE WE NEVER ARE TOO OLD FOR THIS MY DEAR BECAUSE IT IS A PLAY WE ARE PLAYING ALL THE TIME IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
HURRY AND GET DONE DON'T STOP TO QUIRK YOUR LITTLE FINGER AND SIMPER OVER YOUR PLATE AMY CRIED JO CHOKING ON HER TEA AND DROPPING HER BREAD BUTTER SIDE DOWN ON THE CARPET IN HER HASTE TO GET AT THE TREAT
BEFORE MISSUS MARCH COULD REPLY MISTER LAURENCE WENT ON WITH AN ODD LITTLE NOD AND SMILE THEY NEEDN'T SEE OR SPEAK TO ANYONE BUT RUN IN AT ANY TIME FOR I'M SHUT UP IN MY STUDY AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE LAURIE IS OUT A GREAT DEAL
ARMY SHOES BEST TO BE HAD CRIED JO SOME HANDKERCHIEFS ALL HEMMED SAID BETH
I LIKE TO PAY MY DEBTS SO I KNOW YOU WILL ALLOW THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO SEND YOU SOMETHING WHICH ONCE BELONGED TO THE LITTLE GRAND DAUGHTER HE LOST WITH HEARTY THANKS AND BEST WISHES I REMAIN YOUR GRATEFUL FRIEND AND HUMBLE SERVANT JAMES LAURENCE
SHE WAS NOT ELEGANTLY DRESSED BUT A NOBLE LOOKING WOMAN AND THE GIRLS THOUGHT THE GRAY CLOAK AND UNFASHIONABLE BONNET COVERED THE MOST SPLENDID MOTHER IN THE WORLD WELL DEARIES HOW HAVE YOU GOT ON TODAY
NOTHING DELIGHTED YOU MORE THAN TO HAVE ME TIE MY PIECE BAGS ON YOUR BACKS FOR BURDENS GIVE YOU HATS AND STICKS AND ROLLS OF PAPER AND LET YOU TRAVEL THROUGH THE HOUSE FROM THE CELLAR WHICH WAS THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION UP UP TO THE HOUSETOP WHERE
IT WAS A CHEERFUL HOPEFUL LETTER FULL OF LIVELY DESCRIPTIONS OF CAMP LIFE MARCHES AND MILITARY NEWS AND ONLY AT THE END DID THE WRITER'S HEART OVER FLOW WITH FATHERLY LOVE AND LONGING FOR THE LITTLE GIRLS AT HOME
NEVER HAVING KNOWN MOTHER OR SISTERS HE WAS QUICK TO FEEL THE INFLUENCES THEY BROUGHT ABOUT HIM AND THEIR BUSY LIVELY WAYS MADE HIM ASHAMED OF THE INDOLENT LIFE HE LED
BUT THE OLD GENTLEMAN NOT BEING AWARE OF HER INFIRMITY STARED AT HER SO HARD FROM UNDER HIS HEAVY EYEBROWS AND SAID HEY
OH DEAR YES HE LIKED IT AMAZINGLY AND WAS SO TOUCHED AND PLEASED BY THAT CONFIDING LITTLE KISS THAT ALL HIS CRUSTINESS VANISHED AND HE JUST SET HER ON HIS KNEE AND LAID HIS WRINKLED CHEEK
MISSUS MARCH BROKE THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED JO'S WORDS BY SAYING IN HER CHEERY VOICE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU USED TO PLAY PILGRIMS PROGRESS WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE THINGS
HE WAS TIRED OF BOOKS AND FOUND PEOPLE SO INTERESTING NOW THAT MISTER BROOKE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE VERY UNSATISFACTORY REPORTS FOR LAURIE WAS ALWAYS PLAYING TRUANT AND RUNNING OVER TO THE MARCHES NEVER MIND LET HIM TAKE A HOLIDAY AND MAKE IT UP AFTERWARD
IS THAT A DAGGER THAT I SEE BEFORE ME MUTTERED JO ROLLING HER EYES AND CLUTCHING AT THE AIR AS SHE HAD SEEN A FAMOUS TRAGEDIAN DO NO IT'S THE TOASTING FORK WITH MOTHER'S SHOE ON IT INSTEAD OF THE BREAD
SAID AMY MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE NOTE TRY IT HONEY LET'S HEAR THE SOUND OF THE BABY PIANNY SAID HANNAH WHO ALWAYS TOOK A SHARE IN THE FAMILY JOYS AND SORROWS SO BETH TRIED IT AND EVERYONE PRONOUNCED IT THE MOST REMARKABLE PIANO EVER HEARD
AND THE PRETTY RACK AND STOOL ALL COMPLETE ADDED MEG OPENING THE INSTRUMENT AND DISPLAYING ITS BEAUTIES
CHAPTER SIX BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL THE BIG HOUSE DID PROVE A PALACE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR ALL TO GET IN AND BETH FOUND IT VERY HARD TO PASS THE LIONS OLD MISTER LAURENCE WAS THE BIGGEST ONE
AMY FOLLOWED BUT SHE POKED HER HANDS OUT STIFFLY BEFORE HER AND JERKED HERSELF ALONG AS IF SHE WENT BY MACHINERY AND HER OW WAS MORE SUGGESTIVE OF PINS BEING RUN INTO HER THAN OF FEAR AND ANGUISH
I'M NOT AND IF TURNING UP MY HAIR MAKES ME ONE I'LL WEAR IT IN TWO TAILS TILL I'M TWENTY CRIED JO PULLING OFF HER NET AND SHAKING DOWN A CHESTNUT MANE
BETH ATE NO MORE BUT CREPT AWAY TO SIT IN HER SHADOWY CORNER AND BROOD OVER THE DELIGHT TO COME TILL THE OTHERS WERE READY I THINK IT WAS SO SPLENDID IN FATHER TO GO AS CHAPLAIN WHEN HE WAS TOO OLD TO BE DRAFTED AND NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR A SOLDIER SAID MEG WARMLY
I LOVE IT DEARLY AND I'LL COME IF YOU ARE QUITE SURE NOBODY WILL HEAR ME AND BE DISTURBED SHE ADDED FEARING TO BE RUDE AND TREMBLING AT HER OWN BOLDNESS AS SHE SPOKE NOT A SOUL MY DEAR THE HOUSE IS EMPTY HALF THE DAY
NOW COME AND HEAR THE LETTER THEY ALL DREW TO THE FIRE
MEG COULD WALK IN THE CONSERVATORY WHENEVER SHE LIKED AND REVEL IN BOUQUETS JO BROWSED OVER THE NEW LIBRARY VORACIOUSLY AND CONVULSED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH HER CRITICISMS
AND SHE RAN AWAY DECLARING SHE WOULD NEVER GO THERE ANY MORE NOT EVEN FOR THE DEAR PIANO NO PERSUASIONS OR ENTICEMENTS COULD OVERCOME HER FEAR TILL THE FACT COMING TO MISTER LAURENCE'S EAR IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY HE SET ABOUT MENDING MATTERS
IT'S TOO BAD BUT IT CAN'T BE HELPED SO YOU MUST TRY TO BE CONTENTED WITH MAKING YOUR NAME BOYISH AND PLAYING BROTHER TO US GIRLS
A QUICK BRIGHT SMILE WENT ROUND LIKE A STREAK OF SUNSHINE BETH CLAPPED HER HANDS REGARDLESS OF THE BISCUIT SHE HELD AND JO TOSSED UP HER NAPKIN CRYING A LETTER A LETTER THREE CHEERS FOR FATHER
BUT AFTER HE HAD CALLED SAID SOMETHING FUNNY OR KIND TO EACH ONE OF THE GIRLS AND TALKED OVER OLD TIMES WITH THEIR MOTHER NOBODY FELT MUCH AFRAID OF HIM EXCEPT TIMID BETH THE OTHER LION WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE POOR AND LAURIE RICH FOR THIS MADE THEM SHY OF ACCEPTING FAVORS WHICH THEY COULD NOT RETURN
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE SHUT UP FOR HOURS WITH A NERVOUS FUSSY OLD LADY WHO KEEPS YOU TROTTING IS NEVER SATISFIED AND WORRIES YOU TILL YOU'RE READY TO FLY OUT THE WINDOW OR CRY IT'S NAUGHTY TO FRET BUT I DO THINK WASHING DISHES AND KEEPING THINGS TIDY IS THE WORST WORK IN THE WORLD
SHE NEVER SAW LAURIE MOUNT GUARD IN THE HALL TO WARN THE SERVANTS AWAY
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN MISTER HARRISON WAS REALLY INTOLERABLE
BUT SHE PROMISED TO GO AND DIANA OFFERED TO GO WITH HER
CHAPTER TWELVE AVERIL'S ATONEMENT WHAT ARE YOU DREAMING OF ANNE THE TWO GIRLS WERE LOITERING ONE EVENING IN A FAIRY HOLLOW OF THE BROOK FERNS NODDED IN IT
BUT FATHER PUT HIS FOOT DOWN LIVE WITH AUNT ATOSSA HE WOULD NOT IS SHE SO TERRIBLE ASKED ANNE ABSENTLY YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE WHAT SHE'S LIKE BEFORE WE CAN GET AWAY SAID DIANA SIGNIFICANTLY FATHER SAYS SHE HAS A FACE LIKE A HATCHET IT CUTS THE AIR
THIS IS THE END OF MY LITERARY AMBITIONS SHE SAID BITTERLY SHE NEVER MENTIONED THE MATTER TO MISTER HARRISON
OH ISN'T SHE DREADFUL GASPED DIANA AS THEY ESCAPED DOWN THE LANE SHE'S WORSE THAN MISS ELIZA ANDREWS SAID ANNE
BUT SHE SAYS SHE'S GOING TO TEACH AGAIN IN THE FALL AND SHE'S AFTER THE WHITE SANDS SCHOOL SHE'LL BE IN HER GRAVE POOR GIRL WHEN WHITE SANDS SCHOOL OPENS THAT'S WHAT ANNE LISTENED IN SHOCKED SILENCE RUBY GILLIS HER OLD SCHOOL CHUM DYING
RUBY SLIPPED HER ARM ABOUT ANNE'S WAIST WITH A SHALLOW LITTLE LAUGH BUT JUST FOR A MOMENT THEIR EYES MET AND BEHIND ALL THE LUSTER OF RUBY'S ANNE SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE HER HEART ACHE COME UP OFTEN WON'T YOU ANNE WHISPERED RUBY
AVONLEA HAD NOT CHANGED EITHER AT LEAST SO IT SEEMED AT FIRST BUT AS ANNE SAT IN THE GREEN GABLES PEW

DAVY KNEW THEY MUST GO HE DISCARDED TOMMY'S OVERALLS RESUMED HIS OWN RIGHTFUL ATTIRE AND TURNED AWAY FROM HIS STRING OF TROUT WITH A SIGH NO USE TO THINK OF TAKING THEM HOME WELL HADN'T WE A SPLENDID TIME
IF IT IS TRUE THAT SHE IS DYING ANY OTHER SAD THING MIGHT BE TRUE TOO
ALTHOUGH SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT IT IF IT IS A SUCCESS YOU'LL SEE IT WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED GILBERT BUT IF IT IS A FAILURE NOBODY SHALL EVER SEE IT MARILLA KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE VENTURE
AT LEAST THE COTTONS CERTAINLY HAD AND DAVY SEEMED TO HAVE IT NOT BEING ENTIRELY BEREFT OF PRUDENCE
YOU LOOK PALE YOU'D BETTER KEEP OUT OF THE SUN THIS AFTERNOON ADMONISHED MISSUS LYNDE DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY LIES YOU TOLD MISSUS LYNDE ASKED DORA REPROACHFULLY AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALONE AFTER DINNER DAVY
MISSUS LYNDE MIGHT BE BOSSY BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS A BOX OF COOKIES IN HER KITCHEN CUPBOARD AND SHE WAS NOT STINGY AT THIS INCONVENIENT MOMENT DAVY REMEMBERED THAT WHEN HE HAD TORN HIS NEW SCHOOL PANTS THE WEEK BEFORE
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS YOU WOULDN'T DARE SAY BEFORE EVERYBODY

DON'T YOU TELL ME BUT IT WAS NOT AT JANE ANNE GAZED THAT DAY IN DISMAY AND SURPRISE IT WAS AT RUBY GILLIS WHO SAT BESIDE HER IN THE CHOIR WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO RUBY
DAVY WAS STILL BOILING OVER THIS AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF THE LANE DAVY STOPPED AND TWISTED HIS COUNTENANCE INTO SUCH AN UNEARTHLY AND TERRIFIC CONTORTION THAT DORA ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW HIS GIFTS IN THAT RESPECT
AND HIS CATECHISM QUESTION PERFECTLY HAD HE NOT STUDIED THEM PERFORCE IN MISSUS LYNDE'S KITCHEN ALL LAST SUNDAY AFTERNOON DAVY THEREFORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN A PLACID FRAME OF MIND AS A MATTER OF FACT
SHE'D HAVE REFORMED HIM YOU CAN REFORM A MAN

THAT ONE SIN DEMANDS ANOTHER TO COVER IT THEY HAD DINNER WITH MISSUS LYNDE THAT DAY AND THE FIRST THING SHE ASKED DAVY WAS WERE ALL YOUR CLASS IN SUNDAY SCHOOL TODAY YES'M

WELL ANYWAY IT'S A PERFECTLY ELEGANT STORY ANNE AND WILL MAKE YOU FAMOUS OF THAT I'M SURE HAVE YOU GOT A TITLE FOR IT
HE DID BAD THINGS BUT HE DID THEM PERCEVAL HADN'T TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT MOONING MOONING THAT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN PITCHING MAURICE LENNOX WAS THE VILLAIN SAID ANNE INDIGNANTLY I DON'T SEE WHY EVERY ONE LIKES HIM BETTER THAN PERCEVAL
WAS HONESTLY ALARMED LEST HE SHOULD NEVER IN THE WORLD BE ABLE TO GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT AGAIN DARN HER EXPLODED DAVY OH DAVY DON'T SWEAR GASPED DORA IN DISMAY

BUT HER TONGUE IS SHARPER STILL LATE AS IT WAS AUNT ATOSSA WAS CUTTING POTATO SETS IN THE WRIGHT KITCHEN SHE WORE A FADED OLD WRAPPER AND HER GRAY HAIR WAS DECIDEDLY UNTIDY AUNT ATOSSA DID NOT LIKE BEING CAUGHT IN A KILTER
THEY DARED NOT OF COURSE GO FISHING ON THE POND WHERE THEY WOULD BE SEEN BY PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH THEY HAD TO RESORT TO THE BROOK IN THE WOODS BEHIND THE COTTON HOUSE BUT IT WAS FULL OF TROUT AND THEY HAD A GLORIOUS TIME THAT MORNING
HE GLIBLY RECITED AN OLD GOLDEN TEXT LEARNED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO FORTUNATELY MISSUS LYNDE NOW STOPPED QUESTIONING HIM BUT DAVY DID NOT ENJOY HIS DINNER
THOUGH MISSUS LYNDE BELIEVES WE'RE ALL BAD BUT MOST OF US HAVE GOT A LITTLE DECENCY SOMEWHERE IN US KEEP ON WRITING ANNE NO
CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE WAY OF TRANSGRESSORS DAVY AND DORA WERE READY FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL THEY WERE GOING ALONE WHICH DID NOT OFTEN HAPPEN FOR MISSUS LYNDE ALWAYS ATTENDED SUNDAY SCHOOL
SPEAKING OF STORIES DIANA REMARKED ANNE IN A SIGNIFICANT CONFIDENTIAL TONE
THE GOD WOULD HAVE STOPPED HER AS SHE SPAKE BUT SHE WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM THE WORDS ESCAPED AND HE COULD NEITHER UNSAY HIS PROMISE NOR HER REQUEST IN DEEP DISTRESS HE LEFT HER AND RETURNED TO THE UPPER REGIONS
HEAVING A SIGH SHE SAID I HOPE IT WILL TURN OUT SO BUT I CAN'T HELP BEING AFRAID PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY PRETEND TO BE IF HE IS INDEED JOVE MAKE HIM GIVE SOME PROOF OF IT
BUT WAS OPPOSED BY SOME PRINCES WHO DREADED ITS INTRODUCTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISORDERS AND MADNESS IT BROUGHT WITH IT AS HE APPROACHED HIS NATIVE CITY THEBES PENTHEUS THE KING
HE HADN'T FINISHED SPEAKING WHEN A CRACKING SOUND OCCURRED THE NUTS GAVE WAY AND RIPPED OUT OF ITS SOCKET THE SKIFF WAS HURLED LIKE A STONE FROM A SLING INTO THE MIDST OF THE VORTEX
YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS OUR SITUATION HAD BECOME UNTENABLE ONE MORNING WHOSE DATE I'M UNABLE TO SPECIFY
SHADOWS GATHERED AND GLOOM OVERRAN THE SEA UNTIL THE MOON CAME UP I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM I COULDN'T SLEEP I WAS ASSAULTED BY NIGHTMARES THAT HORRIBLE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION KEPT REPEATING IN MY MIND'S EYE
TEACHING THE PEOPLE THE CULTIVATION OF THE VINE THE MOST FAMOUS PART OF HIS WANDERINGS IS HIS EXPEDITION TO INDIA WHICH IS SAID TO HAVE LASTED SEVERAL YEARS RETURNING IN TRIUMPH HE UNDERTOOK TO INTRODUCE HIS WORSHIP INTO GREECE
WHAT WAS IT HAD THEY SPOTTED OUR ESCAPE I FELT NED LAND SLIDING A DAGGER INTO MY HAND YES I MUTTERED WE KNOW HOW TO DIE THE CANADIAN PAUSED IN HIS WORK
THEY WERE SHOUTING THE MAELSTROM COULD A MORE FRIGHTENING NAME HAVE RUNG IN OUR EARS UNDER MORE FRIGHTENING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE WE LYING IN THE DANGEROUS WATERWAYS OFF THE NORWEGIAN COAST
THE PRISONER UNTERRIFIED RESPONDED
I'M WITH YOU WHAT'S MORE THE CANADIAN ADDED IF THEY CATCH ME I'LL DEFEND MYSELF I'LL FIGHT TO THE DEATH THEN WE'LL DIE TOGETHER NED MY FRIEND MY MIND WAS MADE UP THE CANADIAN LEFT ME
THAT FOLLOWS SUCH CONTINUOUS SPINNING MOTIONS WE WERE IN DREAD IN THE LAST STAGES OF SHEER HORROR
AND MYSELF MOUNTED THE HILL TO OBSERVE THE WIND WHEN MY MEN RETURNED BRINGING WITH THEM A PRIZE AS THEY THOUGHT A BOY OF DELICATE APPEARANCE WHOM THEY HAD FOUND ASLEEP THEY JUDGED HE WAS A NOBLE YOUTH PERHAPS A KING'S SON
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS CAME BACK ON I WENT INTO THE LOUNGE IT WAS DESERTED I CONSULTED THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS THE NAUTILUS WAS FLEEING NORTHWARD AT A SPEED OF TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR
THAT OUR HEADING WOULD TAKE US TO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS WITH INCOMPARABLE SPEED I COULD BARELY GLIMPSE THE SWIFT PASSING OF LONGNOSE SHARKS HAMMERHEAD SHARKS SPOTTED DOGFISH THAT FREQUENT THESE WATERS
NOW UPON THE SURFACE NOW UNDER IT SCATTERING THE SPRAY AND SPOUTING THE WATER FROM THEIR BROAD NOSTRILS OF TWENTY MEN I ALONE WAS LEFT TREMBLING WITH FEAR THE GOD CHEERED ME FEAR NOT SAID HE STEER TOWARDS NAXOS
FORTUNATELY I CONTROLLED MYSELF AND STRETCHED OUT ON THE BED TO SOOTHE MY BODILY AGITATION MY NERVES CALMED A LITTLE BUT WITH MY BRAIN SO AROUSED I DID A SWIFT REVIEW OF MY WHOLE EXISTENCE ABOARD THE NAUTILUS
FINALLY SCHOOLS OF PORPOISE THAT HELD CONTESTS OF SPEED WITH THE NAUTILUS BUT BY THIS POINT OBSERVING STUDYING AND CLASSIFYING WERE OUT OF THE QUESTION BY EVENING WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED LEAGUES UP THE ATLANTIC
THE MEN ASTONISHED PULLED AT THEIR OARS AND SPREAD MORE SAIL TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS BY THE AID OF BOTH BUT ALL IN VAIN IVY TWINED ROUND THE OARS AND HINDERED THEIR MOTION AND CLUNG TO THE SAILS WITH HEAVY CLUSTERS OF BERRIES
WHO HAD NO RESPECT FOR THE NEW WORSHIP FORBADE ITS RITES TO BE PERFORMED BUT WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT BACCHUS WAS ADVANCING MEN AND WOMEN BUT CHIEFLY THE LATTER YOUNG AND OLD POURED FORTH TO MEET HIM AND TO JOIN HIS TRIUMPHAL MARCH
I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE DREADING YET DESIRING AN ENCOUNTER WITH CAPTAIN NEMO WANTING YET NOT WANTING TO SEE HIM WHAT WOULD I SAY TO HIM HOW COULD I HIDE THE INVOLUNTARY HORROR HE INSPIRED IN ME NO
BACCHUS THAT FIRST FROM OUT THE PURPLE GRAPES CRUSHED THE SWEET POISON OF MISUSED WINE AFTER THE TUSCAN MANNERS TRANSFORMED COASTING THE TYRRHENE SHORE AS THE WINDS LISTED ON CIRCE'S ISLAND FELL
THERE HE CLOTHED HIMSELF IN HIS SPLENDORS NOT PUTTING ON ALL HIS TERRORS AS WHEN HE OVERTHREW THE GIANTS BUT WHAT IS KNOWN AMONG THE GODS AS HIS LESSER PANOPLY ARRAYED IN THIS HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER OF SEMELE
INSIDE THE NAUTILUS ALL WAS GLOOM AND SILENCE IT LEFT THIS PLACE OF DEVASTATION WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED ONE HUNDRED FEET BENEATH THE WATERS WHERE WAS IT GOING NORTH OR SOUTH
WE WERE RACING NORTH NORTHEAST WITH FRIGHTFUL SPEED FIFTY METERS DOWN I TOOK ONE LAST LOOK AT THE NATURAL WONDERS AND ARTISTIC TREASURES AMASSED IN THE MUSEUM THIS UNRIVALED COLLECTION DOOMED TO PERISH SOMEDAY IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEAS
NOT WALKING BUT GLIDING LIKE A GHOST HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING SWELLING WITH SOBS AND I HEARD HIM MURMUR THESE WORDS THE LAST OF HIS TO REACH MY EARS O ALMIGHTY GOD
HIS FEATURES WERE ACCENTUATED TAKING ON SUPERHUMAN PROPORTIONS HE WAS NO LONGER MY EQUAL HE WAS THE MAN OF THE WATERS THE SPIRIT OF THE SEAS BY THEN IT WAS NINE THIRTY
THIS WRECKAGE MUST HAVE SPENT MANY A YEAR ON THE OCEAN FLOOR WHAT SHIP WAS THIS WHY HAD THE NAUTILUS COME TO VISIT ITS GRAVE WAS IT SOMETHING OTHER THAN A MARITIME ACCIDENT THAT HAD DRAGGED THIS CRAFT UNDER THE WATERS
HERE A HUGE BONEYARD FORMS FROM FISH MOLLUSKS
WHO WAS ENTRUSTED WITH ESCORTING A CONVOY OF WHEAT COMING FROM AMERICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF ADMIRAL VAN STABEL IN THIS SECOND YEAR OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY CALENDAR
SOMETIMES BENEATH THEM THE SHIP WANDERED FOR DAYS AMID THESE MISTS SO FEARED BY NAVIGATORS THESE ARE CAUSED CHIEFLY BY MELTING ICE WHICH KEEPS THE AIR EXTREMELY DAMP
DARING VIGOROUS AND MUSCULAR FISH ARMED WITH PRICKLES ON ITS HEAD AND STINGS ON ITS FINS A REAL SCORPION MEASURING TWO TO THREE METERS THE RUTHLESS ENEMY
HOW MANY SHIPS HAVE PERISHED IN THESE WATERWAYS AS THEY TRIED TO GET DIRECTIONS FROM THE HAZY LIGHTS ON THE COAST HOW MANY CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THESE OPAQUE MISTS HOW MANY COLLISIONS HAVE OCCURRED WITH THESE REEFS
WOULD THE NAUTILUS DARE TO TACKLE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL NED LAND WHO PROMPTLY REAPPEARED AFTER WE HUGGED SHORE NEVER STOPPED QUESTIONING ME WHAT COULD I ANSWER HIM
THE TOTAL IS THE SAME FINE CONSEIL REPLIED I'LL TAKE MASTER'S WORD FOR IT I WON'T COUNT THEM COUNT WHAT THOSE ELEVEN MILLION EGGS BUT I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT
OF A CORK FLOAT THE NAUTILUS HAD TO MANEUVER SHREWDLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNDERWATER SPIDERWEB BUT THE SHIP DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THESE HEAVILY TRAVELED WATERWAYS IT WENT UP TO ABOUT LATITUDE FORTY TWO DEGREES
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELEVEN MILLION MY FRIEND ELEVEN MILLION I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT UNTIL I COUNT THEM MYSELF SO COUNT THEM CONSEIL
THIS BROUGHT IT ABREAST OF SAINT JOHN'S IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND HEART'S CONTENT WHERE THE ATLANTIC CABLE REACHES ITS END POINT INSTEAD OF CONTINUING NORTH THE NAUTILUS TOOK AN EASTERLY HEADING
A ONE METER LUMPFISH BLACKISH ON TOP
CAN PROTECT ITS RESPIRATORY ORGANS FROM ANY PARCHING CONTACT WITH THE AIR AND CAN LIVE OUT OF WATER FOR A GOOD WHILE AND I'LL MENTION FOR THE RECORD SOME LITTLE BANDED BLENNIES
POOR NED WENT INTO SECLUSION LIKE CAPTAIN NEMO CONSEIL AND I NO LONGER LEFT EACH OTHER AS I SAID THE NAUTILUS VEERED TO THE EAST TO BE MORE ACCURATE I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO THE NORTHEAST
THE FINE LAD AND LET HIM DOWN GENTLY BY GIVING HIM VARIOUS DETAILS ON THE LAYING OF THIS CABLE THE FIRST CABLE WAS PUT DOWN DURING THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BUT
AS IF TO GO ALONG THIS PLATEAU ON WHICH THE TELEGRAPH CABLE RESTS WHERE MULTIPLE SOUNDINGS HAVE GIVEN THE CONTOURS OF THE TERRAIN WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY IT WAS ON MAY SEVENTEENTH
WHICH WAS PROTECTED BY A PADDING OF TEXTILE MATERIAL ENCLOSED IN A METAL SHEATH THE GREAT EASTERN PUT BACK TO SEA ON JULY THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
TO ITS LOWEST REACHES LOCATED FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE METERS DOWN
AND IN ONLY A FEW YEARS HOW MANY VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FURNISHED TO THE OBITUARY NOTICES BY THE ROYAL MAIL INMAN AND MONTREAL LINES BY VESSELS NAMED THE SOLWAY THE ISIS THE PARAMATTA
ITS THREE MASTS GONE WATER IN ITS HOLD A THIRD OF ITS CREW OUT OF ACTION IT PREFERRED TO GO TO THE BOTTOM WITH ITS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX SEAMEN RATHER THAN SURRENDER AND WITH ITS FLAG
IT CARRIED SEVENTY FOUR CANNONS AND WAS LAUNCHED IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT COMMANDED BY LA POYPE VERTRIEUX
DYING OVER IT BY THE BILLIONS THE SEA IS OF NO GREAT DEPTH AT THE GRAND BANKS A FEW HUNDRED FATHOMS AT BEST BUT TO THE SOUTH THERE IS A DEEP
AFTER GIVING THE CANADIAN A GLIMPSE OF AMERICAN SHORES WAS HE ABOUT TO SHOW ME THE COAST OF FRANCE BUT THE NAUTILUS KEPT GRAVITATING SOUTHWARD ON MAY THIRTIETH
I LOOKED TO PORT AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THESE TRANQUIL WATERS TO STARBOARD A PROMINENT BULGE ON THE SEA BOTTOM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
OTHERS NEWER AND REFLECTING OUR BEACON LIGHT ON THEIR IRONWORK AND COPPER UNDERSIDES AMONG THESE VESSELS HOW MANY WENT DOWN WITH ALL HANDS WITH THEIR CREWS AND HOSTS OF IMMIGRANTS
THIS CABLE WILL NO DOUBT LAST INDEFINITELY BECAUSE AS OBSERVERS NOTE
THAT FOLLOW SHIPS INTO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS SHARP SNOUTED CARP EXCLUSIVE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC SCORPIONFISH AND LASTLY
BESIDES ON THIS WELL CHOSEN PLATEAU THE CABLE NEVER LIES AT DEPTHS THAT COULD CAUSE A BREAK THE NAUTILUS
OF THE ISLAND OF GRENADA ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE UNDER THE COUNT DE GRASSE IT TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE OF CHESAPEAKE BAY IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR
THE NAUTILUS'S FISHERMEN HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING A GRIP ON THIS ANIMAL WHICH THANKS TO THE FORMATION OF ITS GILL COVERS
