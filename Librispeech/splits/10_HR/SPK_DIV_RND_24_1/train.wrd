PETER NO I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT SAID UNCLE ALEC STERNLY I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WERE FIGHTING ABOUT BUT YOU MUST SETTLE YOUR QUARRELS IN A DIFFERENT FASHION REMEMBER MY COMMANDS FELIX PETER
CONVENTIONALITY IS NOT MORALITY SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT RELIGION TO ATTACK THE FIRST IS NOT TO ASSAIL THE LAST TO PLUCK THE MASK FROM THE FACE OF THE PHARISEE IS NOT TO LIFT AN IMPIOUS HAND TO THE CROWN OF THORNS
ALL HIS MOTHER'S AVERSION ALL THE SERVANTS PARTIALITY TURNED UP IN MY DISTURBED MIND LIKE A DARK DEPOSIT IN A TURBID WELL WHY WAS I ALWAYS SUFFERING ALWAYS BROWBEATEN
FORGIVE ME I CANNOT ENDURE IT LET ME BE PUNISHED SOME OTHER WAY I SHALL BE KILLED IF SILENCE
I MOUNTED INTO THE WINDOW SEAT GATHERING UP MY FEET I SAT CROSS LEGGED LIKE A TURK AND HAVING DRAWN THE RED MOREEN CURTAIN NEARLY CLOSE I WAS SHRINED IN DOUBLE RETIREMENT
BESSIE AND ABBOT ENTERED MISS EYRE ARE YOU ILL SAID BESSIE
EITHER OF VISION OR CONCEPTION BUT ELIZA JUST PUT HER HEAD IN AT THE DOOR AND SAID AT ONCE
I SAY CORDIALLY GENTLEMEN I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART
THAT CERTAINLY WAS A CRIME AND WAS I FIT TO DIE OR WAS THE VAULT UNDER THE CHANCEL OF GATESHEAD CHURCH AN INVITING BOURNE IN SUCH VAULT I HAD BEEN TOLD DID MISTER REED LIE BURIED AND LED BY THIS THOUGHT TO RECALL HIS IDEA
AND HE WAS STILL HER OWN DARLING I DARED COMMIT NO FAULT
I RETURNED TO MY BOOK
HE CONTRIVED TO EAT A BITTER APPLE WITHOUT A GRIMACE UNTIL HE CAME TO THE LAST BITE WHICH PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM BUT FELIX WAS VASTLY ENCOURAGED
A COOL AUTUMNAL WIND WAS WHISTLING AMONG THE DARK BOUGHS AND SCATTERING BLOOD RED LEAVES FROM THE MAPLE AT THE END OF THE GRANARY NOW SAID DAN I'LL COUNT
EVEN IF YOU WAS BROUGHT UP IN TORONTO I S'POSE YOU THINK A HIRED BOY HASN'T ANY BUSINESS TO PRAY FOR PARTICULAR THINGS BUT I'LL SHOW YOU I'LL JUST PRAY FOR WHAT I PLEASE AND I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY AND STOP ME
STOOD OUT LIKE A TABERNACLE IN THE CENTRE THE TWO LARGE WINDOWS WITH THEIR BLINDS ALWAYS DRAWN DOWN WERE HALF SHROUDED IN FESTOONS AND FALLS OF SIMILAR DRAPERY THE CARPET WAS RED THE TABLE AT THE FOOT OF THE BED WAS COVERED WITH A CRIMSON CLOTH
PLEADED BESSIE LET HER GO WAS THE ONLY ANSWER LOOSE BESSIE'S HAND CHILD YOU CANNOT SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT BY THESE MEANS BE ASSURED I ABHOR ARTIFICE PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN
I DWELT ON IT WITH GATHERING DREAD I COULD NOT REMEMBER HIM BUT I KNEW THAT HE WAS MY OWN UNCLE
SHE NEVER SAW HIM STRIKE OR HEARD HIM ABUSE ME THOUGH HE DID BOTH NOW AND THEN IN HER VERY PRESENCE MORE FREQUENTLY HOWEVER BEHIND HER BACK
A NOXIOUS THING CHERISHING THE GERMS OF INDIGNATION AT THEIR TREATMENT OF CONTEMPT OF THEIR JUDGMENT I KNOW THAT HAD I BEEN A SANGUINE BRILLIANT CARELESS EXACTING HANDSOME ROMPING CHILD THOUGH EQUALLY DEPENDENT AND FRIENDLESS
AS THE VERY MASTER OF THAT WORKING CORPS WHO WOULD RESTORE TO RECTITUDE THE WARPED SYSTEM OF THINGS BECAUSE I THINK NO COMMENTATOR ON HIS WRITINGS HAS YET FOUND THE COMPARISON THAT SUITS HIM THE TERMS WHICH RIGHTLY CHARACTERISE HIS TALENT
DID SHE SAY THAT TO ME DID YOU HEAR HER ELIZA AND GEORGIANA WON'T I TELL MAMA BUT FIRST HE RAN HEADLONG AT ME I FELT HIM GRASP MY HAIR AND MY SHOULDER HE HAD CLOSED WITH A DESPERATE THING
CECILY GAVE A SHRIEK AND RAN OUT OF THE WOOD WE THOUGHT SHE HAD FLED BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD AND WE WERE NOT SORRY FOR HER MANIFEST DISAPPROVAL AND ANXIETY WERE DAMPING THE EXCITEMENT OF THE OCCASION
DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO FORSAKE THE RED ROOM IT WAS PAST FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE BECLOUDED AFTERNOON WAS TENDING TO DREAR TWILIGHT I HEARD THE RAIN STILL BEATING CONTINUOUSLY ON THE STAIRCASE WINDOW AND THE WIND HOWLING IN THE GROVE BEHIND THE HALL
I CAN NOW CONJECTURE READILY THAT THIS STREAK OF LIGHT WAS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GLEAM FROM A LANTERN CARRIED BY SOME ONE ACROSS THE LAWN BUT THEN PREPARED AS MY MIND WAS FOR HORROR SHAKEN AS MY NERVES WERE BY AGITATION
A SINGULAR NOTION DAWNED UPON ME I DOUBTED NOT NEVER DOUBTED THAT IF MISTER REED HAD BEEN ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE TREATED ME KINDLY
SAID FELIX OMINOUSLY THEY TELL ME THAT YOU'VE BEEN PRAYING RIGHT ALONG THAT I COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE NOW I TELL YOU
AND PERHAPS TO PINING AFTER HOME JOHN HAD NOT MUCH AFFECTION FOR HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AN ANTIPATHY TO ME HE BULLIED AND PUNISHED ME NOT TWO OR THREE TIMES IN THE WEEK
MISSUS REED IMPATIENT OF MY NOW FRANTIC ANGUISH AND WILD SOBS ABRUPTLY THRUST ME BACK AND LOCKED ME IN WITHOUT FARTHER PARLEY I HEARD HER SWEEPING AWAY AND SOON AFTER SHE WAS GONE I SUPPOSE I HAD A SPECIES OF FIT
AND THITHER WE ALL RESORTED AT SUNSET I HOPE FELIX WILL BEAT SAID THE STORY GIRL TO ME NOT ONLY FOR THE FAMILY HONOUR BUT BECAUSE THAT WAS A MEAN MEAN PRAYER OF PETER'S DO YOU THINK HE WILL I DON'T KNOW
MY HEAD STILL ACHED AND BLED WITH THE BLOW AND FALL I HAD RECEIVED NO ONE HAD REPROVED JOHN FOR WANTONLY STRIKING ME AND BECAUSE I HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM TO AVERT FARTHER IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE
BUT IF HE DOES THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SETTLE IT BUT HOW WILL THAT SETTLE IT ASKED CECILY
DID YOU EVER FIGHT ASKED THE STORY GIRL ONCE I SAID BRIEFLY DREADING THE NEXT QUESTION WHICH PROMPTLY CAME WHO BEAT IT IS SOMETIMES A BITTER THING TO TELL THE TRUTH
GAMBLING WHAT WOULD AUNT JANE SAY IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO FIGHT CECILY DEMANDED OF PETER DON'T YOU DRAG MY AUNT JANE INTO THIS AFFAIR SAID PETER DARKLY YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE A PRESBYTERIAN
HE'S GOT TO STOP PRAYING AGAINST ME ANYHOW SAID FELIX RESOLUTELY
I FEARED NOTHING BUT INTERRUPTION AND THAT CAME TOO SOON
AND YOU'VE GOT TO STOP IT PETER CRAIG
WHEN SHE CHANCED TO BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AND WHEN HAVING BROUGHT HER IRONING TABLE TO THE NURSERY HEARTH SHE ALLOWED US TO SIT ABOUT IT AND WHILE SHE GOT UP MISSUS REED'S LACE FRILLS AND CRIMPED HER NIGHTCAP BORDERS
UNCLE ALEC WALKED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE GRANARY WITH CECILY BEHIND HIM HE WAS NOT ANGRY THERE WAS A QUIZZICAL LOOK IN HIS EYES BUT HE TOOK THE COMBATANTS BY THEIR SHIRT COLLARS AND DRAGGED THEM APART THIS STOPS RIGHT HERE BOYS
THE OTHER FELLOW I SAID WITH RELUCTANT HONESTY WELL SAID THE STORY GIRL I THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU GET WHIPPED OR NOT SO LONG AS YOU FIGHT A GOOD SQUARE FIGHT
SAID FELIX THE GIRLS GASPED BUT DAN AND I WERE JUBILANT SNUFFING BATTLE AFAR OFF ALL RIGHT I CAN FIGHT AS WELL AS PRAY OH DON'T FIGHT IMPLORED CECILY I THINK IT WOULD BE DREADFUL
THESE THINGS AND DEEDS ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED
HE TOLD FELICITY AND FELICITY TOLD ME SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT IT WAS REAL CUTE OF HIM I THINK THAT IS A DREADFUL WAY TO TALK ABOUT PRAYING AND I TOLD HER SO
AND APPEARING BEFORE THE EYES OF BELATED TRAVELLERS I RETURNED TO MY STOOL SUPERSTITION WAS WITH ME AT THAT MOMENT BUT IT WAS NOT YET HER HOUR FOR COMPLETE VICTORY MY BLOOD WAS STILL WARM
HER POTENT VOICE MADE ME FEEL THAT I WAS QUITE A HERO AFTER ALL AND THE STING WENT OUT OF MY RECOLLECTION OF THAT OLD FIGHT WHEN WE ARRIVED BEHIND THE GRANARY THE OTHERS WERE ALL THERE
CECILY KEEP QUIET NOW ONE TWO THREE PETER AND FELIX PITCHED IN WITH MORE ZEAL THAN DISCRETION ON BOTH SIDES AS A RESULT PETER GOT WHAT LATER DEVELOPED INTO A BLACK EYE AND FELIX'S NOSE BEGAN TO BLEED
I HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THESE WORDS THEY WERE NOT NEW TO ME MY VERY FIRST RECOLLECTIONS OF EXISTENCE INCLUDED HINTS OF THE SAME KIND THIS REPROACH OF MY DEPENDENCE HAD BECOME A VAGUE SING SONG IN MY EAR
OF HIM WHO WOULD PRESENTLY DEAL IT
I GUESS YOU MEAN PRINCIPLE I SUGGESTED YES THAT'S IT AGREED PETER IT'S ALL RIGHT TO FIGHT FOR PRINCIPLE IT'S KIND OF PRAYING WITH YOUR FISTS OH CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING TO PREVENT THEM FROM FIGHTING SARA
SCARCELY LESS PROMINENT WAS AN AMPLE CUSHIONED EASY CHAIR NEAR THE HEAD OF THE BED ALSO WHITE WITH A FOOTSTOOL BEFORE IT AND LOOKING AS I THOUGHT LIKE A PALE THRONE THIS ROOM WAS CHILL BECAUSE IT SELDOM HAD A FIRE
AS RUNNING AWAY OR IF THAT COULD NOT BE EFFECTED NEVER EATING OR DRINKING MORE AND LETTING MYSELF DIE WHAT A CONSTERNATION OF SOUL WAS MINE THAT DREARY AFTERNOON
TELL MAMA SHE IS RUN OUT INTO THE RAIN BAD ANIMAL IT IS WELL I DREW THE CURTAIN THOUGHT I AND I WISHED FERVENTLY HE MIGHT NOT DISCOVER MY HIDING PLACE NOR WOULD JOHN REED HAVE FOUND IT OUT HIMSELF HE WAS NOT QUICK
ALWAYS ACCUSED FOR EVER CONDEMNED WHY COULD I NEVER PLEASE
I MAY BE MISTAKEN BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THE STORY GIRL WANTED THAT FIGHT STOPPED
AND SO NO DOUBT SHE FELT IT I WAS A PRECOCIOUS ACTRESS IN HER EYES SHE SINCERELY LOOKED ON ME AS A COMPOUND OF VIRULENT PASSIONS MEAN SPIRIT AND DANGEROUS DUPLICITY BESSIE AND ABBOT HAVING RETREATED
I REALLY SAW IN HIM A TYRANT A MURDERER I FELT A DROP OR TWO OF BLOOD FROM MY HEAD TRICKLE DOWN MY NECK AND WAS SENSIBLE OF SOMEWHAT PUNGENT SUFFERING THESE SENSATIONS FOR THE TIME PREDOMINATED OVER FEAR AND I RECEIVED HIM IN FRANTIC SORT
AND WHEN I DARED MOVE I GOT UP AND WENT TO SEE ALAS YES NO JAIL WAS EVER MORE SECURE RETURNING I HAD TO CROSS BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS MY FASCINATED GLANCE INVOLUNTARILY EXPLORED THE DEPTH IT REVEALED
IT ISN'T FAIR OH FELIX DON'T TALK LIKE THAT SAID CECILY SHOCKED GOD MUST BE FAIR I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE REASON PETER PRAYS THREE TIMES A DAY REGULAR
I MIGHT SAY NEVER INDEED UNLESS WHEN A CHANCE INFLUX OF VISITORS AT GATESHEAD HALL RENDERED IT NECESSARY TO TURN TO ACCOUNT ALL THE ACCOMMODATION IT CONTAINED YET IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND STATELIEST CHAMBERS IN THE MANSION
BUT HATE AS IT WILL IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AHAB DID NOT LIKE MICAIAH BECAUSE HE NEVER PROPHESIED GOOD CONCERNING HIM BUT EVIL
BUT THE MOTHER'S HEART TURNED FROM AN OPINION SO HARSH
THAT RESERVOIR OF FROST AND SNOW WHERE FIRM FIELDS OF ICE THE ACCUMULATION OF CENTURIES OF WINTERS
I REALIZED HOW DEEPLY HE FELT ON THE SUBJECT AND HOPED HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL FELIX PRAYED EARNESTLY THAT HE MIGHT BE ENABLED TO EAT A BITTER APPLE WITHOUT MAKING A FACE AND WHEN HE HAD PRAYED THREE NIGHTS AFTER THIS MANNER
AND GAVE SIGNIFICANCE TO THE ROCK STANDING UP ALONE IN A SEA OF BILLOW AND SPRAY TO THE BROKEN BOAT STRANDED ON A DESOLATE COAST
FELIX MARCHED OVER TO UNCLE ROGER'S AND WE TRAILED AFTER SCENTING A SCENE WE FOUND PETER SHELLING BEANS IN THE GRANARY AND WHISTLING CHEERILY AS WITH A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENCE TOWARDS ALL MEN LOOK HERE PETER
WAS UNIVERSALLY INDULGED HER BEAUTY HER PINK CHEEKS AND GOLDEN CURLS SEEMED TO GIVE DELIGHT TO ALL WHO LOOKED AT HER AND TO PURCHASE INDEMNITY FOR EVERY FAULT JOHN NO ONE THWARTED MUCH LESS PUNISHED
ROGER IS LOOKING FOR YOU TO WASH HIS BUGGY BE OFF
TO LET WHITE WASHED WALLS VOUCH FOR CLEAN SHRINES
I NEVER MENTIONED YOUR NAME I NEVER PRAYED THAT YOU COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE I JUST PRAYED THAT I'D BE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD WELL THAT'S THE SAME THING CRIED FELIX YOU'VE JUST BEEN PRAYING FOR THE OPPOSITE TO ME OUT OF SPITE
CECILY WAS VERY PALE AND FELIX AND PETER WERE TAKING OFF THEIR COATS THERE WAS A PURE YELLOW SUNSET THAT EVENING
BUT TO FELIX EVERYTHING SUDDENLY BECAME FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE BECAUSE PETER CONTINUED TO HOLD THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF BITTER APPLES IT HAUNTED HIS WAKING HOURS AND OBSESSED HIS NIGHTS I HEARD HIM TALKING IN HIS SLEEP ABOUT IT
BE SEATED SOMEWHERE AND UNTIL YOU CAN SPEAK PLEASANTLY REMAIN SILENT A BREAKFAST ROOM ADJOINED THE DRAWING ROOM I SLIPPED IN THERE IT CONTAINED A BOOKCASE I SOON POSSESSED MYSELF OF A VOLUME
ALSO I HAD DRAWN PARALLELS IN SILENCE WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT THUS TO HAVE DECLARED ALOUD
CHAPTER TWO I RESISTED ALL THE WAY A NEW THING FOR ME AND A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GREATLY STRENGTHENED THE BAD OPINION BESSIE AND MISS ABBOT WERE DISPOSED TO ENTERTAIN OF ME THE FACT IS I WAS A TRIFLE BESIDE MYSELF
AT THIS MOMENT A LIGHT GLEAMED ON THE WALL WAS IT I ASKED MYSELF A RAY FROM THE MOON PENETRATING SOME APERTURE IN THE BLIND NO MOONLIGHT WAS STILL AND THIS STIRRED
ADDED BESSIE IN NO HARSH VOICE YOU SHOULD TRY TO BE USEFUL AND PLEASANT THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE A HOME HERE BUT IF YOU BECOME PASSIONATE AND RUDE MISSIS WILL SEND YOU AWAY I AM SURE BESIDES SAID MISS ABBOT
OR RATHER OUT OF MYSELF AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT A MOMENT'S MUTINY HAD ALREADY RENDERED ME LIABLE TO STRANGE PENALTIES AND LIKE ANY OTHER REBEL SLAVE I FELT RESOLVED IN MY DESPERATION TO GO ALL LENGTHS
BUT CONTINUALLY EVERY NERVE I HAD FEARED HIM AND EVERY MORSEL OF FLESH IN MY BONES SHRANK WHEN HE CAME NEAR THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I WAS BEWILDERED BY THE TERROR HE INSPIRED
VERY PAINFUL AND CRUSHING BUT ONLY HALF INTELLIGIBLE MISS ABBOT JOINED IN
AND WHAT A SCREAM
THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY WE HAD BEEN WANDERING INDEED IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING BUT SINCE DINNER MISSUS REED WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY DINED EARLY THE COLD WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT
THEIR TWO PAIR OF HANDS ARRESTED ME INSTANTLY IF YOU DON'T SIT STILL YOU MUST BE TIED DOWN SAID BESSIE
ELIZA WHO WAS HEADSTRONG AND SELFISH WAS RESPECTED GEORGIANA WHO HAD A SPOILED TEMPER A VERY ACRID SPITE
NOW I'LL TEACH YOU TO RUMMAGE MY BOOKSHELVES FOR THEY ARE MINE ALL THE HOUSE BELONGS TO ME OR WILL DO IN A FEW YEARS
I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE WOULD SAY HE RETORTED FELICITY TRIED ANOTHER TACK YOU'LL BE SURE TO GET WHIPPED IF YOU FIGHT WITH PETER SHE SAID YOU'RE TOO FAT TO FIGHT
WHAT DOES BESSIE SAY I HAVE DONE I ASKED JANE I DON'T LIKE CAVILLERS OR QUESTIONERS BESIDES THERE IS SOMETHING TRULY FORBIDDING IN A CHILD TAKING UP HER ELDERS IN THAT MANNER
IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE REMOTE FROM THE NURSERY AND KITCHEN SOLEMN BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN TO BE SO SELDOM ENTERED THE HOUSE MAID ALONE CAME HERE ON SATURDAYS TO WIPE FROM THE MIRRORS AND THE FURNITURE A WEEK'S QUIET DUST
THE PILED UP MATTRESSES AND PILLOWS OF THE BED
I BEGAN TO RECALL WHAT I HAD HEARD OF DEAD MEN TROUBLED IN THEIR GRAVES BY THE VIOLATION OF THEIR LAST WISHES REVISITING THE EARTH TO PUNISH THE PERJURED AND AVENGE THE OPPRESSED
ALL SAID I WAS WICKED AND PERHAPS I MIGHT BE SO
IT IS MY DUTY TO SHOW YOU THAT TRICKS WILL NOT ANSWER YOU WILL NOW STAY HERE AN HOUR LONGER AND IT IS ONLY ON CONDITION OF PERFECT SUBMISSION AND STILLNESS THAT I SHALL LIBERATE YOU THEN O AUNT HAVE PITY
AT INTERVALS WHILE TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF MY BOOK I STUDIED THE ASPECT OF THAT WINTER AFTERNOON AFAR IT OFFERED A PALE BLANK OF MIST AND CLOUD NEAR A SCENE OF WET LAWN AND STORM BEAT SHRUB WITH CEASELESS RAIN
NOR COULD I PASS UNNOTICED THE SUGGESTION OF THE BLEAK SHORES OF LAPLAND SIBERIA SPITZBERGEN NOVA ZEMBLA ICELAND GREENLAND WITH THE VAST SWEEP OF THE ARCTIC ZONE AND THOSE FORLORN REGIONS OF DREARY SPACE
AFTER THAT NO MORAL FORCE ON EARTH COULD HAVE PREVENTED FELIX FROM FIGHTING HE WOULD HAVE FACED AN ARMY WITH BANNERS YOU MIGHT SETTLE IT BY DRAWING LOTS SAID CECILY DESPERATELY DRAWING LOTS IS WICKEDER THAT FIGHTING SAID DAN
WHOSE EARS DETECT IN EACH PROTEST AGAINST BIGOTRY THAT PARENT OF CRIME AN INSULT TO PIETY THAT REGENT OF GOD ON EARTH I WOULD SUGGEST TO SUCH DOUBTERS CERTAIN OBVIOUS DISTINCTIONS
OH I SAW A LIGHT AND I THOUGHT A GHOST WOULD COME I HAD NOW GOT HOLD OF BESSIE'S HAND AND SHE DID NOT SNATCH IT FROM ME
AND IN THOSE LAST WORDS LIES THE SECRET OF THE RED ROOM THE SPELL WHICH KEPT IT SO LONELY IN SPITE OF ITS GRANDEUR MISTER REED HAD BEEN DEAD NINE YEARS IT WAS IN THIS CHAMBER HE BREATHED HIS LAST
AND I THOUGHT MISTER REED'S SPIRIT HARASSED BY THE WRONGS OF HIS SISTER'S CHILD MIGHT QUIT ITS ABODE WHETHER IN THE CHURCH VAULT OR IN THE UNKNOWN WORLD OF THE DEPARTED AND RISE BEFORE ME IN THIS CHAMBER
AND THEN MY COURAGE SANK MY HABITUAL MOOD OF HUMILIATION SELF DOUBT
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN HER WAS THE REPLY I'VE TOLD MISSIS OFTEN MY OPINION ABOUT THE CHILD
IT WAS ULTIMATELY ARRANGED THAT THE COMBAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE FIR WOOD BEHIND UNCLE ROGER'S GRANARY IT WAS A NICE REMOTE BOSKY PLACE WHERE NO PROWLING GROWN UP WOULD BE LIKELY TO INTRUDE
THE TWO SHIPS BECALMED ON A TORPID SEA I BELIEVED TO BE MARINE PHANTOMS
I WAS LOADED WITH GENERAL OPPROBRIUM UNJUST UNJUST SAID MY REASON FORCED BY THE AGONISING STIMULUS INTO PRECOCIOUS THOUGH TRANSITORY POWER AND RESOLVE EQUALLY WROUGHT UP
I TURN TO ANOTHER CLASS A SMALL ONE SO FAR AS I KNOW BUT NOT THEREFORE TO BE OVERLOOKED I MEAN THE TIMOROUS OR CARPING FEW WHO DOUBT THE TENDENCY OF SUCH BOOKS AS JANE EYRE IN WHOSE EYES WHATEVER IS UNUSUAL IS WRONG
HE HAD NOT FELT VERY KEENLY OVER THE MATTER OF THE SERMONS AND CERTAINLY THE MERE FACT THAT PETER COULD EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT MAKING FACES DID NOT CAST ANY REFLECTION ON THE HONOUR OR ABILITY OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS
AND FELT SORE WHENEVER I THOUGHT OF MY FAILURE BUT I HAD NO BURNING DESIRE TO EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT GRIMACING AND I DID NOT SYMPATHIZE OVER AND ABOVE WITH MY BROTHER WHEN HOWEVER HE TOOK TO PRAYING ABOUT IT
A BED SUPPORTED ON MASSIVE PILLARS OF MAHOGANY
IF ANYTHING COULD HAVE MADE HIM THIN THE WAY HE WORRIED OVER THIS MATTER WOULD HAVE DONE IT FOR MYSELF I CARED NOT A GROAT
EACH PICTURE TOLD A STORY MYSTERIOUS OFTEN TO MY UNDEVELOPED UNDERSTANDING AND IMPERFECT FEELINGS YET EVER PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING AS INTERESTING AS THE TALES BESSIE SOMETIMES NARRATED ON WINTER EVENINGS
AND FOR THE LOOK YOU HAD IN YOUR EYES TWO MINUTES SINCE YOU RAT
A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF JANE EYRE BEING UNNECESSARY I GAVE NONE THIS SECOND EDITION DEMANDS A FEW WORDS BOTH OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS REMARK MY THANKS ARE DUE IN THREE QUARTERS
OF THESE DEATH WHITE REALMS I FORMED AN IDEA OF MY OWN
I WIPED MY TEARS AND HUSHED MY SOBS FEARFUL LEST ANY SIGN OF VIOLENT GRIEF MIGHT WAKEN A PRETERNATURAL VOICE TO COMFORT ME OR ELICIT FROM THE GLOOM SOME HALOED FACE BENDING OVER ME WITH STRANGE PITY
ALL LOOKED COLDER AND DARKER IN THAT VISIONARY HOLLOW THAN IN REALITY AND THE STRANGE LITTLE FIGURE THERE GAZING AT ME WITH A WHITE FACE AND ARMS SPECKING THE GLOOM
BUT SHE ONLY WANTED TO BRING US ALL HERE I KNOW HER NAUGHTY TRICKS WHAT IS ALL THIS
PLEADED CECILY TURNING TO THE STORY GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A BIN SWINGING HER SHAPELY BARE FEET TO AND FRO IT DOESN'T DO TO MEDDLE IN AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND BETWEEN BOYS SAID THE STORY GIRL SAGELY
SHE NOW CAME UPON THE SCENE FOLLOWED BY BESSIE AND HER MAID ABBOT
AND HUMBLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY PHYSICAL INFERIORITY TO ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA REED THE SAID ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA WERE NOW CLUSTERED ROUND THEIR MAMA IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE LAY RECLINED ON A SOFA BY THE FIRESIDE
WITH SUBDUED BROKEN REFLECTIONS VARYING THE GLOSS OF ITS PANELS TO MY LEFT WERE THE MUFFLED WINDOWS A GREAT LOOKING GLASS BETWEEN THEM REPEATED THE VACANT MAJESTY OF THE BED AND ROOM I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THEY HAD LOCKED THE DOOR
NO YOU ARE LESS THAN A SERVANT FOR YOU DO NOTHING FOR YOUR KEEP THERE SIT DOWN AND THINK OVER YOUR WICKEDNESS THEY HAD GOT ME BY THIS TIME INTO THE APARTMENT INDICATED BY MISSUS REED AND HAD THRUST ME UPON A STOOL
BESSIE ANSWERED NOT BUT ERE LONG ADDRESSING ME SHE SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE AWARE MISS THAT YOU ARE UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO MISSUS REED SHE KEEPS YOU
IN THE MORNING AND AT DINNER TIME AND AT NIGHT AND BESIDES THAT ANY TIME THROUGH THE DAY WHEN HE HAPPENS TO THINK OF IT HE JUST PRAYS STANDING UP DID YOU EVER HEAR OF SUCH GOINGS ON WELL
MY CARE WAS HOW TO ENDURE THE BLOW WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW THE INSULT WHAT WERE YOU DOING BEHIND THE CURTAIN HE ASKED I WAS READING SHOW THE BOOK I RETURNED TO THE WINDOW AND FETCHED IT THENCE
YOU ARE A DEPENDENT MAMA SAYS YOU HAVE NO MONEY YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU NONE YOU OUGHT TO BEG AND NOT TO LIVE HERE WITH GENTLEMEN'S CHILDREN LIKE US AND EAT THE SAME MEALS WE DO
CRIED THE LADY'S MAID WHAT SHOCKING CONDUCT MISS EYRE TO STRIKE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN YOUR BENEFACTRESS'S SON YOUR YOUNG MASTER MASTER HOW IS HE MY MASTER AM I A SERVANT
NOT SOON ENOUGH HOWEVER THE VOLUME WAS FLUNG IT HIT ME AND I FELL STRIKING MY HEAD AGAINST THE DOOR AND CUTTING IT THE CUT BLED THE PAIN WAS SHARP MY TERROR HAD PASSED ITS CLIMAX OTHER FEELINGS SUCCEEDED
MEN TOO OFTEN CONFOUND THEM THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONFOUNDED APPEARANCE SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR TRUTH NARROW HUMAN DOCTRINES THAT ONLY TEND TO ELATE AND MAGNIFY A FEW SHOULD NOT BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE WORLD REDEEMING CREED OF CHRIST
AND HE'S A YEAR OLDER THAN FELIX
AND COULD DISCOVER BY HER OWN OBSERVATION THAT I WAS ENDEAVOURING IN GOOD EARNEST TO ACQUIRE A MORE SOCIABLE AND CHILDLIKE DISPOSITION A MORE ATTRACTIVE AND SPRIGHTLY MANNER SOMETHING LIGHTER FRANKER MORE NATURAL AS IT WERE
NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
PERSISTED CECILY GOOD PRESBYTERIANS DON'T FIGHT OH DON'T THEY I HEARD YOUR UNCLE ROGER SAY THAT PRESBYTERIANS WERE THE BEST FOR FIGHTING IN THE WORLD OR THE WORST I FORGET WHICH HE SAID BUT IT MEANS THE SAME THING
HE CALLED HIS MOTHER OLD GIRL TOO SOMETIMES REVILED HER FOR HER DARK SKIN SIMILAR TO HIS OWN BLUNTLY DISREGARDED HER WISHES NOT UNFREQUENTLY TORE AND SPOILED HER SILK ATTIRE
THE WARDROBE THE TOILET TABLE THE CHAIRS WERE OF DARKLY POLISHED OLD MAHOGANY
MY HEAD GREW HOT A SOUND FILLED MY EARS WHICH I DEEMED THE RUSHING OF WINGS SOMETHING SEEMED NEAR ME I WAS OPPRESSED SUFFOCATED ENDURANCE BROKE DOWN I RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND SHOOK THE LOCK IN DESPERATE EFFORT
AN HONOUR IS AWARDED WHERE IT IS NOT MERITED AND CONSEQUENTLY DENIED WHERE IT IS JUSTLY DUE
SOMETHING BAD MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND FETCH YOU AWAY THEY WENT SHUTTING THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT BEHIND THEM THE RED ROOM WAS A SQUARE CHAMBER VERY SELDOM SLEPT IN
HE STRUCK SUDDENLY AND STRONGLY I TOTTERED AND ON REGAINING MY EQUILIBRIUM RETIRED BACK A STEP OR TWO FROM HIS CHAIR
AND HIS LEAN FRAME FLASHED FORWARD LIKE A BENT BOW SUDDENLY RELEASED AT THE SAME INSTANT LE LOUP WITH A WILD LAUGH BOUNDED BACKWARD WITH A MOVEMENT AS SWIFT AS KANE'S HIS TIMING WAS PERFECT HIS BACK FLUNG HANDS STRUCK THE TABLE AND HURLED IT ASIDE
WOULD JOIN IN THE SATURNALIA AND INCREASE THE HIDEOUSNESS OF EVENTS NOW INEVITABLE UNABLE TO REACH A DECISION HIS OWN MEN AND HAGTHORPE'S TOOK THE MATTER OFF HIS HANDS EAGER TO GIVE CHASE TO RIVAROL
AH PARDIEU AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE THREATENING ME
I ASSURE YOU I AM AS READY AS I EVER WILL BE I MIGHT ASK MONSIEUR THE SAME QUESTION NO DOUBT I STATED MY INQUIRY WRONGLY KANE SAID GRIMLY I WILL CHANGE IT ARE YOU PREPARED TO MEET YOUR MASTER THE DEVIL AS TO THAT MONSIEUR
FROM SOMEWHERE SEEMED TO COME AN ECHO OF A MOCKING LAUGH KANE WHIRLED EYES FIXED ON THE DIMLY OUTLINED ENTRANCE
THE LATTER GREETED HIM I MUST SPEAK FRANKLY AND YOU MUST SUFFER IT MY MEN ARE ON THE POINT OF MUTINY
NO SAID BLOOD THICKLY AND FOR ONCE HE WAS COMMUNICATIVE IT MAY WELL BE THAT HE MUST VENT THE THING THAT OPPRESSED HIM OR BE DRIVEN MAD BY IT AND PITT AFTER ALL WAS HIS FRIEND AND LOVED HIM AND SO A PROPER MAN FOR CONFIDENCES BUT IF SHE KNEW
YOU KNOW THE DETAILS BETTER THAN I THERE WAS A GIRL THERE A MERE CHILD WHO HOPING TO ESCAPE YOUR LUST FLED UP THE VALLEY BUT YOU YOU JACKAL OF HELL YOU CAUGHT HER AND LEFT HER VIOLATED AND DYING I FOUND HER THERE
THEIR POSITION THEN ACCORDING TO PITT'S LOG
THOUGH SO DARK AND STILL HE STOOD THAT A FANTASTIC SEMBLANCE OF SHADOW WAS LENT HIM BY THE GUTTERING CANDLE A TALL MAN AS TALL AS LE LOUP HE WAS CLAD IN BLACK FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN PLAIN CLOSE FITTING GARMENTS THAT SOMEHOW SUITED THE SOMBER FACE
THE WIND TO WHICH THEY WERE SAILING VERY CLOSE WAS WESTERLY AND IT BORE TO THEIR EARS A BOOMING SOUND WHICH IN LESS EXPERIENCED EARS MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR THE BREAKING OF SURF UPON A LEE SHORE GUNS SAID PITT WHO STOOD WITH BLOOD UPON THE QUARTER DECK BLOOD NODDED LISTENING
LONG ARMS AND BROAD SHOULDERS BETOKENED THE SWORDSMAN AS PLAINLY AS THE LONG RAPIER IN HIS HAND THE FEATURES OF THE MAN WERE SATURNINE AND GLOOMY A KIND OF DARK PALLOR LENT HIM A GHOSTLY APPEARANCE IN THE UNCERTAIN LIGHT AN EFFECT HEIGHTENED BY THE SATANIC DARKNESS OF HIS LOWERING BROWS
YOU ARE SOLOMON KANE I SUPPOSE HE ASKED MANAGING TO MAKE HIS QUESTION SOUND POLITELY INCURIOUS I AM SOLOMON KANE THE VOICE WAS RESONANT AND POWERFUL ARE YOU PREPARED TO MEET YOUR GOD WHY MONSIEUR LE LOUP ANSWERED BOWING
CAPTAIN BLOOD AND THE GREATER PORTION OF HIS BUCCANEERS HAD BEEN AT THEIR POST ON THE HEIGHTS OF NUESTRA SENORA DE LA POUPA UTTERLY IN IGNORANCE OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE BLOOD ALTHOUGH THE MAN CHIEFLY IF NOT SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SWIFT REDUCTION OF THE CITY
THE MEN KNOW AND THEY ARE VERY SKILLED IN THESE COMPUTATIONS THAT IT EXCEEDS THE ENORMOUS TOTAL OF FORTY MILLIONS THEY INSIST THAT THE TREASURE ITSELF BE PRODUCED AND WEIGHED IN THEIR PRESENCE AS IS THE CUSTOM AMONG THE BRETHREN OF THE COAST
HE WOULD PRESENT A RECKONING FOR ALL THE PETTY AFFRONTS AND INSULTS TO WHICH THAT UNSPEAKABLE FELLOW NOW PROVED A SCOUNDREL HAD SUBJECTED HIM WE MUST FOLLOW HE DECLARED FOLLOW AND PUNISH AT FIRST THAT WAS THE GENERAL CRY
YES I REMEMBER THE WENCH MON DIEU SO THE SOFTER SENTIMENTS ENTER INTO THE AFFAIR MONSIEUR I HAD NOT THOUGHT YOU AN AMOROUS MAN BE NOT JEALOUS GOOD FELLOW THERE ARE MANY MORE WENCHES LE LOUP TAKE CARE KANE EXCLAIMED A TERRIBLE MENACE IN HIS VOICE
FOR A WHILE AT LEAST LE LOUP DID NOT WONDER AS TO THE FATE OF LA MON KANE'S PRESENCE IN THE CAVE WAS SUFFICIENT ANSWER THAT DID NOT NEED THE TRACE OF BLOOD ON HIS RAPIER TO VERIFY IT WHAT I WISH TO KNOW MONSIEUR SAID THE BANDIT
WHEN BLOOD TORN AS HE WAS BETWEEN CONFLICTING CONSIDERATIONS STILL HESITATED THEY BORE HIM ALMOST BY MAIN FORCE ABOARD THE ARABELLA WITHIN AN HOUR THE WATER CASKS AT LEAST REPLENISHED AND STOWED ABOARD THE ARABELLA AND THE ELIZABETH PUT TO SEA UPON THAT ANGRY CHASE
AND IT GLITTERED IN THE EYES OF THE WOLF WITH THE SAME GLEAM WHICH SPARKLED FROM HIS SHEATHED DAGGER THE CHESTS WERE EMPTY THEIR TREASURE LYING IN A SHIMMERING MASS UPON THE BLOODSTAINED FLOOR THE WOLF STOPPED AND LISTENED OUTSIDE WAS SILENCE
HE LOOKED UP IRRITATED BY THE INTERRUPTION WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD'S ADVENT OCCASIONED
AND INDEED AWAY TO THE NORTHWEST FAINTLY VISIBLE AS A BANK OF CLOUDS APPEARED THE GREAT RIDGE OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS WHOSE PEAKS WERE THRUST INTO THE CLEAR UPPER AIR ABOVE THE LOW LYING HAZE
WHAT NOW WHAT REMAINS LOYAL SERVICE WITH THE ENGLISH WAS MADE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME LOYAL SERVICE WITH FRANCE HAS LED TO THIS AND THAT IS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE HEREAFTER WHAT TO LIVE CLEAN
INTO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE THAT FORMED THE BANDIT LAIR A MAN STAGGERED HIS EYES WERE WIDE AND STARING HE REELED ON BUCKLING LEGS AND A DARK RED STAIN DYED HIS TUNIC HE CAME A FEW TOTTERING STEPS FORWARD THEN PITCHED ACROSS THE TABLE SLIDING OFF ONTO THE FLOOR
I AND THAT THIEF LA MON ARE ALL THAT ARE LEFT WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST THE RAT'S PALLID LIPS BARELY FORMED THE WORD FLIGHT YOU ARE RIGHT LET US TAKE THE GEMS AND GOLD FROM THE CHESTS AND FLEE USING THE SECRET PASSAGEWAY
THEN ONLY DID BLOOD REALIZE THE RASHNESS OF HIS PROPOSAL AND IN ATTEMPTING TO DRAW BACK HE ALMOST PRECIPITATED A BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES INTO WHICH THAT SAME PROPOSAL HAD NOW DIVIDED THE BUCCANEERS AND MEANWHILE THOSE FRENCH SAILS ON THE HORIZON WERE GROWING LESS AND LESS
THEN CAME THE CONSIDERATION THAT ONLY TWO OF THE BUCCANEER SHIPS WERE SEAWORTHY AND THESE COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE THE WHOLE FORCE PARTICULARLY BEING AT THE MOMENT INDIFFERENTLY VICTUALLED FOR A LONG VOYAGE THE CREWS OF THE LACHESIS AND ATROPOS AND WITH THEM THEIR CAPTAINS WOLVERSTONE AND YBERVILLE
TORMENT IN THE EYES THAT STARED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM SEEING NOTHING WHAT NOW PETER CRIED THE YOUNG SOMERSET MARINER LORD MAN
AND AGAINST WHOM SHOULD HE BE IN ACTION BUT AGAINST FRIENDS OF OURS I THINK IT MAY CONCERN US ANYWAY WE'LL STAND IN TO INVESTIGATE BID THEM PUT THE HELM OVER CLOSE HAULED THEY TACKED AWEATHER GUIDED BY THE SOUND OF COMBAT WHICH GREW IN VOLUME AND DEFINITION AS THEY APPROACHED IT
THE FELLOW SPOKEN TO REPLIED SULLENLY THIS SOLOMON KANE IS A DEMON FROM HELL I TELL YOU FAUGH DOLT HE IS A MAN WHO WILL DIE FROM A PISTOL BALL OR A SWORD THRUST SO THOUGHT JEAN JUAN AND LA COSTA
BLOOD'S IRONY LAUGHED IN HIS EYES YET WHATEVER YOU MAY BE I WARN YOU THAT UNLESS YOU YIELD TO A DEMAND THAT I CONSIDER JUST AND THEREFORE UPHOLD YOU MAY LOOK FOR TROUBLE
AND ABOVE HER DEAD FORM I MADE UP MY MIND TO HUNT YOU DOWN AND KILL YOU
I KNEW NO GOOD WOULD COME FROM HANGING THAT FRIAR A MOON AGO THE WOLF STRUMMED IMPATIENTLY UPON THE TABLE HIS KEEN FACE DESPITE LINES OF WILD LIVING AND DISSIPATION WAS THE FACE OF A THINKER
THAT SHIFTED THE BASIS OF THE ARGUMENT TO LESS HOSTILE GROUND
WHEREAS I HAVE GIVEN YOU CLEARLY TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE FIRST THAT YOU ARE SIMPLY IN THE POSITION OF HAVING ACCEPTED SERVICE UNDER ME YOUR PROPER APPREHENSION OF THAT FACT WILL SAVE THE WASTE OF A DEAL OF WORDS BLOOD CONTAINED HIMSELF WITH DIFFICULTY
AND STILL LESS HIS MEN RESENTMENT SMOULDERED AMONGST THEM FOR A WHILE TO FLAME OUT VIOLENTLY AT THE END OF THAT WEEK IN CARTAGENA IT WAS ONLY BY UNDERTAKING TO VOICE THEIR GRIEVANCE TO THE BARON THAT THEIR CAPTAIN WAS ABLE FOR THE MOMENT TO PACIFY THEM
THE SPEAKER LEANED FORWARD HIS FIST POUNDING EMPHASIS ON THE RUDE TABLE BETWEEN THEM HE WAS A TALL RANGY BUILT MAN SUPPLE AS A LEOPARD AND WITH A LEAN CRUEL PREDATORY FACE HIS EYES DANCED AND GLITTERED WITH A KIND OF RECKLESS MOCKERY
AND THE VOLUNTEERS AND NEGROES FROM HISPANIOLA WHOM HE HAD SWINDLED NO LESS THE TWO PARTIES WERE FUSED INTO ONE BY THEIR COMMON FURY AND BEFORE THE EXHIBITION OF IT THE INHABITANTS OF THAT ILL FATED TOWN WERE STRICKEN WITH DEEPER TERROR THAN THEY HAD YET KNOWN SINCE THE COMING OF THIS EXPEDITION
HIS PROMPTINGS WERE REASONS ENOUGH FOR HIS ACTIONS YOU ARE RIGHT MONSIEUR LE LOUP WAS SPARRING NOW FOR TIME CASUALLY HE EDGED BACKWARD INCH BY INCH WITH SUCH CONSUMMATE ACTING SKILL THAT HE AROUSED NO SUSPICION EVEN IN THE HAWK WHO WATCHED HIM MONSIEUR SAID HE
DETERMINED THE TERMS OF THE CAPITULATION THIS WAS A SLIGHT THAT AT ANOTHER TIME CAPTAIN BLOOD WOULD NOT HAVE BORNE FOR A MOMENT BUT AT PRESENT IN HIS ODD FRAME OF MIND AND ITS DIVORCEMENT FROM PIRACY HE WAS CONTENT TO SMILE HIS UTTER CONTEMPT OF THE FRENCH GENERAL
THAT REFLECTED A THOUSAND CHANGING LIGHTS AND GLEAMS LIKE SOME STRANGE GEM THERE WAS MOCKERY IN THOSE EYES CRUELTY AND RECKLESSNESS THE EYES OF THE MAN IN BLACK ON THE OTHER HAND DEEP SET AND STARING FROM UNDER PROMINENT BROWS WERE COLD BUT DEEP GAZING INTO THEM
THAT HE MIGHT NOT THEREAFTER FIND HIMSELF IN SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAINTAIN HIS HOLD OF WHAT HE HAD SEIZED THE END OF IT ALL WAS THAT HE GAVE A PROMISE AT ONCE TO MAKE THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS AND IF CAPTAIN BLOOD AND HIS OFFICERS WOULD WAIT UPON HIM ON BOARD THE VICTORIEUSE TO MORROW MORNING
IS WHY IN THE DEVIL'S NAME HAVE YOU HARASSED MY BAND AS YOU HAVE AND HOW DID YOU DESTROY THAT LAST SET OF FOOLS YOUR LAST QUESTION IS EASILY ANSWERED SIR KANE REPLIED I MYSELF HAD THE TALE SPREAD THAT THE HERMIT POSSESSED A STORE OF GOLD
NO YOU FOOL I DO NOT CLASS YOU WITH MYSELF MON DIEU MONSIEUR KANE YOU HAVE A TASK INDEED IF YOU INTEND TO AVENGE ALL THE WENCHES WHO HAVE KNOWN MY FAVORS SHADES OF DEATH SHALL I WASTE TIME IN PARLEYING WITH THIS BASE SCOUNDREL KANE SNARLED IN A VOICE SUDDENLY BLOOD THIRSTING
TEN MILES AWAY PERHAPS FIFTEEN SOMEWHERE OFF PORT ROYAL I SHOULD JUDGE PITT ADDED THEN HE LOOKED AT HIS CAPTAIN DOES IT CONCERN US HE ASKED GUNS OFF PORT ROYAL THAT SHOULD ARGUE COLONEL BISHOP AT WORK
LE LOUP EXAMINED HIS FINGER NAILS WITH ELABORATE UNCONCERN I MUST SAY THAT I CAN AT PRESENT RENDER A MOST SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT TO HIS HORNED EXCELLENCY
WEIGHED IN THEIR PRESENCE AND THEIR FIFTH SHARE SURRENDERED THERE AND THEN INTO THEIR OWN KEEPING AMONG THE BUCCANEERS THAT NIGHT
THE WOLF SHOOK THE MAN SAVAGELY THE OTHER BANDIT GAZING ON IN WIDE EYED HORROR WE REACHED THE HERMIT'S HUT JUST AS THE MOON ROSE THE MAN MUTTERED I STAYED OUTSIDE TO WATCH THE OTHERS WENT IN TO TORTURE THE HERMIT
THE BARON SAT THERE SCRUTINIZING LEDGERS LIKE A CITY MERCHANT AND CHECKING FIGURES TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL WAS CORRECT TO THE LAST PESO A CHOICE OCCUPATION THIS FOR THE GENERAL OF THE KING'S ARMIES BY SEA AND LAND
ONE HAD THE IMPRESSION OF LOOKING INTO COUNTLESS FATHOMS OF ICE NOW THE EYES CLASHED AND THE WOLF WHO WAS USED TO BEING FEARED FELT A STRANGE COOLNESS ON HIS SPINE THE SENSATION WAS NEW TO HIM A NEW THRILL TO ONE WHO LIVED FOR THRILLS AND HE LAUGHED SUDDENLY
THE AIR WAS TENSE FOR AN INSTANT THEN THE WOLF RELAXED ELABORATELY WHO WAS THE GIRL HE ASKED IDLY YOUR WIFE I NEVER SAW HER BEFORE ANSWERED KANE NOM D'UN NOM SWORE THE BANDIT WHAT SORT OF A MAN ARE YOU MONSIEUR
EAGERLY ANXIOUSLY SCANNING THE SEA AHEAD AND PRESENTLY AN OBJECT LOOMED INTO VIEW WHICH SOON DEFINED ITSELF FOR A GREAT SHIP ON FIRE
AND LA MON HE CAN WATCH UNTIL WE ARE READY TO FLEE THEN WHY DIVIDE THE TREASURE THREE WAYS A FAINT SMILE TOUCHED THE RAT'S MALEVOLENT FEATURES THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT SMOTE HIM HE INDICATING THE CORPSE ON THE FLOOR SAID
HELL'S DEVILS CURSED THE WOLF HAULING HIM UPRIGHT AND PROPPING HIM IN A CHAIR WHERE ARE THE REST CURSE YOU DEAD ALL DEAD
ANSWERED THE OTHER GRIMLY WHERE ARE THEY ASK THE MOUNTAIN WOLVES THAT TORE THE FLESH FROM THEIR DEAD BONES WHERE DOES THIS KANE HIDE WE HAVE SEARCHED THE MOUNTAINS AND THE VALLEYS FOR LEAGUES AND WE HAVE FOUND NO TRACE I TELL YOU LE LOUP HE COMES UP FROM HELL
PLUNGING THE CAVE INTO DARKNESS AS THE CANDLE TOPPLED AND WENT OUT KANE'S RAPIER SANG LIKE AN ARROW IN THE DARK AS HE THRUST BLINDLY AND FEROCIOUSLY ADIEU MONSIEUR GALAHAD THE TAUNT CAME FROM SOMEWHERE IN FRONT OF HIM BUT KANE PLUNGING TOWARD THE SOUND WITH THE SAVAGE FURY OF BAFFLED WRATH
THE FIRST AND NATURAL ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THESE SHIPS MUST BELONG TO THE JAMAICA FLEET AND THAT THE BURNING VESSEL WAS A DEFEATED BUCCANEER AND BECAUSE OF THIS THEY SPED ON TO PICK UP THE THREE BOATS THAT WERE STANDING AWAY FROM THE BLAZING HULK
NOW DON'T BE RASH MY MEN ARE WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS AS YOU ARE AWARE THEY DEMAND TO KNOW WHEN THIS SHARING OF THE SPOIL IS TO TAKE PLACE AND WHEN THEY ARE TO RECEIVE THE FIFTH FOR WHICH THEIR ARTICLES PROVIDE GOD GIVE ME PATIENCE
YOU MAY DEFINE OUR POSITIONS AS YOU PLEASE SAID HE BUT I'LL REMIND YOU THAT THE NATURE OF A THING IS NOT CHANGED BY THE NAME YOU GIVE IT I AM CONCERNED WITH FACTS CHIEFLY WITH THE FACT THAT WE ENTERED INTO DEFINITE ARTICLES WITH YOU
RENOUNCED THE INTENTION AFTER ALL THERE WOULD BE A DEAL OF TREASURE STILL HIDDEN IN CARTAGENA THEY WOULD REMAIN BEHIND TO EXTORT IT WHILST FITTING THEIR SHIPS FOR SEA LET BLOOD AND HAGTHORPE AND THOSE WHO SAILED WITH THEM DO AS THEY PLEASED
I KNOW NOTHING OF FILIBUSTER CUSTOMS THE GENTLEMAN WAS DISDAINFUL BUT YOU ARE LEARNING QUICKLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ROGUE I AM A LEADER OF ARMIES NOT OF PLUNDERING THIEVES OH BUT OF COURSE
HE FOUND HIM IN THE OFFICES WHICH THE BARON HAD SET UP IN THE TOWN WITH A STAFF OF CLERKS TO REGISTER THE TREASURE BROUGHT IN AND TO CAST UP THE SURRENDERED ACCOUNT BOOKS WITH A VIEW TO ASCERTAINING PRECISELY WHAT WERE THE SUMS YET TO BE DELIVERED UP
THE OUTLINES OF THE BLAZING VESSEL GREW CLEARER PRESENTLY HER MASTS STOOD OUT SHARP AND BLACK ABOVE THE SMOKE AND FLAMES AND THROUGH HIS TELESCOPE BLOOD MADE OUT PLAINLY THE PENNON OF SAINT GEORGE FLUTTERING FROM HER MAINTOP AN ENGLISH SHIP HE CRIED
IF SHE KNEW O GOD I HAD THOUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITH PIRACY THOUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT FOR EVER
KNOWING THAT WOULD DRAW YOUR SCUM AS CARRION DRAWS VULTURES FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS I HAVE WATCHED THE HUT AND TONIGHT WHEN I SAW YOUR VILLAINS COMING I WARNED THE HERMIT AND TOGETHER WE WENT AMONG THE TREES BACK OF THE HUT
TAKING WITH HIM THE TROOPS AND MARINERS HE HAD BROUGHT FROM FRANCE HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM AT CARTAGENA NOT ONLY THE EMPTY HANDED BUCCANEERS WHOM HE HAD SWINDLED
THUS FOR AN HOUR PERHAPS THEN AS TELESCOPE TO HIS EYE BLOOD RAKED THE HAZE EXPECTING AT ANY MOMENT TO BEHOLD THE BATTLING SHIPS THE GUNS ABRUPTLY CEASED THEY HELD TO THEIR COURSE NEVERTHELESS WITH ALL HANDS ON DECK
A BLOW IN THE FACE COULD SCARCELY HAVE TAKEN THE FRENCHMAN MORE ABACK HE STIFFENED AND DREW HIMSELF UP HIS EYES BLAZING HIS FACE OF A DEATHLY PALLOR THE CLERKS AT THE TABLES LAID DOWN THEIR PENS AND AWAITED THE EXPLOSION IN A SORT OF TERROR
THEY WANT TO VIEW THE TREASURE ITSELF THEY KNOW YOU COMPEL ME TO BE BLUNT THAT THE ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN FALSIFIED YOUR BOOKS SHOW THE SPOIL OF CARTAGENA
WHEN WE WERE WELL AT SEA AND THE ARABELLA'S COURSE WAS LAID WRITES PITT IN HIS LOG I WENT TO SEEK THE CAPTAIN KNOWING HIM TO BE IN GREAT TROUBLE OF MIND OVER THESE EVENTS I FOUND HIM SITTING ALONE IN HIS CABIN HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS
SUDDENLY LE LOUP THREW BACK HIS HEAD HIS EYES DANCING AND LEAPING WITH A WILD MOCKERY AND A KIND OF INSANE RECKLESSNESS HIS SHOUT OF LAUGHTER SENT THE ECHOES FLYING
THINK OF CARTAGENA THINK OF THE HELL THOSE DEVILS WILL BE MAKING OF IT NOW AND I MUST HAVE THAT ON MY SOUL
THEN THE SPANIARD JUAN IS STRUCK DOWN AND AFTER WE FIND HIM HE LIVES LONG ENOUGH TO TELL US THAT THE SLAYER IS AN ENGLISHMAN SOLOMON KANE WHO HAS SWORN TO DESTROY OUR ENTIRE BAND WHAT THEN LA COSTA
BUT SOMETHING REMAINED THE LAST THING THAT HE COULD HAVE EXPECTED SOMETHING TOWARDS WHICH THEY WERE RAPIDLY SAILING OVER THE TROPICAL SUNLIT SEA ALL THIS AGAINST WHICH HE NOW INVEIGHED SO BITTERLY WAS BUT A NECESSARY STAGE IN THE SHAPING OF HIS ODD DESTINY
TO MAKE HIM REVEAL THE HIDING PLACE OF HIS GOLD YES YES THEN WHAT THE WOLF WAS RAGING WITH IMPATIENCE THEN THE WORLD TURNED RED THE HUT WENT UP IN A ROAR AND A RED RAIN FLOODED THE VALLEY THROUGH IT I SAW
EYES LARGE DEEP SET AND UNBLINKING FIXED THEIR GAZE UPON THE BANDIT AND LOOKING INTO THEM LE LOUP WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE WHAT COLOR THEY WERE STRANGELY THE MEPHISTOPHELEAN TREND OF THE LOWER FEATURES WAS OFFSET BY A HIGH BROAD FOREHEAD
HE SCANNED THE SEAS FOR THE CONQUEROR IN THE BATTLE OF WHICH THIS GRIM EVIDENCE WAS ADDED TO THAT OF THE SOUNDS THEY HAD HEARD AND WHEN AT LAST AS THEY DREW CLOSER TO THE DOOMED VESSEL THEY MADE OUT THE SHADOWY OUTLINES OF THREE TALL SHIPS SOME THREE OR FOUR MILES AWAY STANDING IN TOWARD PORT ROYAL
I HAVE NEVER YET DONE A MAN TO DEATH BY TORTURE BUT BY GOD SIR YOU TEMPT ME THE TONE AND MORE ESPECIALLY THE UNEXPECTED OATH COMING AS IT DID FROM KANE SLIGHTLY SOBERED LE LOUP HIS EYES NARROWED AND HIS HAND MOVED TOWARD HIS RAPIER
BUT WHEN THE NEXT DAWN BROKE OVER CARTAGENA THEY HAD THE EXPLANATION OF IT THE ONLY SHIPS TO BE SEEN IN THE HARBOUR WERE THE ARABELLA AND THE ELIZABETH RIDING AT ANCHOR AND THE ATROPOS AND THE LACHESIS CAREENED ON THE BEACH FOR REPAIR OF THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED IN THE BOMBARDMENT
THEN WHEN THE ROGUES WERE INSIDE I STRUCK FLINT AND STEEL TO THE TRAIN I HAD LAID AND FLAME RAN THROUGH THE TREES LIKE A RED SNAKE UNTIL IT REACHED THE POWDER I HAD PLACED BENEATH THE HUT FLOOR THEN THE HUT AND THIRTEEN SINNERS WENT TO HELL IN A GREAT ROAR OF FLAME AND SMOKE
CHAPTER TWO THE LAIR OF THE WOLF YOU ARE A FOOL THE WORDS CAME IN A COLD SNARL THAT CURDLED THE HEARER'S BLOOD HE WHO HAD JUST BEEN NAMED A FOOL LOWERED HIS EYES SULLENLY WITHOUT ANSWER YOU AND ALL THE OTHERS I LEAD
DO YOU REALLY DARE SO MUCH YOU AND THE DIRTY THIEVES THAT FOLLOW YOU GOD'S BLOOD YOU SHALL ANSWER TO ME FOR THAT WORD
WHICH WAS PROVING A VERITABLE TREASURE HOUSE WAS NOT EVEN SHOWN THE CONSIDERATION OF BEING CALLED TO THE COUNCIL OF OFFICERS
IT IS THAT DIRTY THIEF WHO HAS BROUGHT ALL THIS ABOUT WHAT COULD YOU HAVE DONE TO PREVENT IT I WOULD HAVE STAYED IF IT COULD HAVE AVAILED IT COULD NOT AND YOU KNOW IT
THOUGH THIS WAS PARTLY HIDDEN BY A FEATHERLESS HAT THAT FOREHEAD MARKED THE DREAMER THE IDEALIST THE INTROVERT JUST AS THE EYES AND THE THIN STRAIGHT NOSE BETRAYED THE FANATIC AN OBSERVER WOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE EYES OF THE TWO MEN WHO STOOD THERE FACING EACH OTHER
FAUGH I SAY AGAIN THE FELLOW HAS FOUND SOME CAVERN OR SECRET VALE OF WHICH WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE HIDES IN THE DAY AND AT NIGHT HE SALLIES FORTH AND SLAYS US GLOOMILY COMMENTED THE OTHER HE HUNTS US DOWN AS A WOLF HUNTS DEER BY GOD LE LOUP
THE FIRST WE KNOW OF THIS MAN IS WHEN WE FIND JEAN THE MOST DESPERATE BANDIT UNHUNG NAILED TO A TREE WITH HIS OWN DAGGER THROUGH HIS BREAST
HE GAVE IT WITH AN EXTREME ILL GRACE AND ONLY BECAUSE BLOOD MADE HIM REALIZE AT LAST THAT TO WITHHOLD IT LONGER WOULD BE DANGEROUS IN AN ENGAGEMENT HE MIGHT CONCEIVABLY DEFEAT BLOOD'S FOLLOWERS BUT CONCEIVABLY HE MIGHT NOT AND EVEN IF HE SUCCEEDED THE EFFORT WOULD BE SO COSTLY TO HIM IN MEN
THE RAT WITH A MUTTERED EXCLAMATION OF SURPRIZE BENT OVER THE CHEST INDICATED WITH A SINGLE CATLIKE MOTION THE WOLF SPRANG UPON HIM SHEATHING HIS DAGGER TO THE HILT IN THE RAT'S BACK BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS THE RAT SAGGED TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT A SOUND
CAPTAIN BLOOD ALONE KEPT HIS HEAD SETTING A CURB UPON HIS DEEP CHAGRIN
WHO TAKES UP A FEUD OF THIS SORT MERELY TO AVENGE A WENCH UNKNOWN TO YOU THAT SIR IS MY OWN AFFAIR IT IS SUFFICIENT THAT I DO SO KANE COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED EVEN TO HIMSELF NOR DID HE EVER SEEK AN EXPLANATION WITHIN HIMSELF A TRUE FANATIC
I WILL REMIND YOU SAID BLOOD THAT I AM SPEAKING NOT FOR MYSELF BUT FOR MY MEN IT IS THEY WHO ARE NOT SATISFIED THEY WHO THREATEN THAT UNLESS SATISFACTION IS AFFORDED THEM AND PROMPTLY THEY WILL TAKE IT
THE HERMIT AND A TALL MAN CLAD ALL IN BLACK COMING FROM THE TREES SOLOMON KANE GASPED THE BANDIT I KNEW IT I SILENCE FOOL SNARLED THE CHIEF GO ON I FLED KANE PURSUED WOUNDED ME
THE LIGHT UNCERTAIN AND DANCING GLEAMED REDLY IN THE SLOWLY WIDENING LAKE OF BLOOD IN WHICH THE DEAD MAN LAY IT DANCED UPON THE HEAPS OF GEMS AND COINS EMPTIED HASTILY UPON THE FLOOR FROM THE BRASS BOUND CHESTS THAT RANGED THE WALLS
I GRANT YOU THE ADMIRATION I MUST NEEDS BESTOW ON A BRAVE AND SHREWD FOEMAN YET TELL ME THIS WHY HAVE YOU FOLLOWED ME AS A WOLF FOLLOWS DEER SOME MOONS AGO SAID KANE HIS FROWN BECOMING MORE MENACING
I GOT HERE FIRST DOES THAT MEAN KANE WAS PURSUING HIM HERE AND AS THE WOLF NODDED IMPATIENTLY THE OTHER TURNED TO THE CHESTS WITH CHATTERING HASTE
EYES OF BOTH BETOKENED UNTOLD DEEPS OF POWER BUT THERE THE RESEMBLANCE CEASED
THEY SAY THAT HEREAFTER THERE WILL BE NO ASCERTAINING WHAT THE SPOIL REALLY AMOUNTS TO BUT NAME OF HEAVEN I HAVE KEPT BOOKS THEY ARE THERE FOR ALL TO SEE THEY DO NOT WISH TO SEE ACCOUNT BOOKS FEW OF THEM CAN READ
THE FRENCH SHIPS WERE GONE THEY HAD BEEN QUIETLY AND SECRETLY WARPED OUT OF THE HARBOUR UNDER COVER OF NIGHT AND THREE SAILS FAINT AND SMALL ON THE HORIZON TO WESTWARD WAS ALL THAT REMAINED TO BE SEEN OF THEM
SETTING A COURSE FOR HISPANIOLA SINCE THEY JUDGED THAT THITHER MUST RIVAROL GO TO REFIT BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO CROSS TO FRANCE THE ARABELLA AND THE ELIZABETH PLOUGHED BRISKLY NORTHWARD WITH A MODERATELY FAVOURABLE WIND FOR TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS WITHOUT EVER CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF THEIR QUARRY
WHY DIVIDE THE TREASURE TWO WAYS MURMURED LE LOUP WIPING HIS BLADE UPON THE DEAD MAN'S DOUBLET NOW FOR LA MON HE STEPPED TOWARD THE DOOR THEN STOPPED AND SHRANK BACK
OUR BEST MEN HAVE BEEN DONE TO DEATH BY HIM MUSED THE BANDIT CHIEF SOON THE REST RETURN FROM THAT LITTLE TRIP TO THE HERMIT'S THEN WE SHALL SEE KANE CAN NOT HIDE FOREVER THEN HA WHAT WAS THAT THE TWO TURNED SWIFTLY AS A SHADOW FELL ACROSS THE TABLE
TRUE ONE ESCAPED BUT HIM I HAD SLAIN IN THE FOREST HAD NOT I STUMBLED AND FALLEN UPON A BROKEN ROOT WHICH GAVE HIM TIME TO ELUDE ME MONSIEUR SAID LE LOUP WITH ANOTHER LOW BOW
THERE WAS NO MOON AND LE LOUP'S KEEN IMAGINATION PICTURED THE DARK SLAYER SOLOMON KANE GLIDING THROUGH THE BLACKNESS A SHADOW AMONG SHADOWS HE GRINNED CROOKEDLY THIS TIME THE ENGLISHMAN WOULD BE FOILED THERE IS A CHEST YET UNOPENED SAID HE POINTING
BUT I OUTRAN HIM GOT HERE FIRST THE MAN SLUMPED FORWARD ON THE TABLE SAINTS AND DEVILS RAGED THE WOLF WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE THIS KANE LIKE SATAN
I WARN YOU OF THE TROUBLE THAT A LITTLE PRUDENCE MAY AVERT YOU DO NOT KNOW ON WHAT A VOLCANO YOU ARE SITTING YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WAYS OF BUCCANEERS IF YOU PERSIST CARTAGENA WILL BE DRENCHED IN BLOOD AND WHATEVER THE OUTCOME THE KING OF FRANCE WILL NOT HAVE BEEN WELL SERVED
CAPTAIN BLOOD I TOO WILL SPEAK FRANKLY AND YOU TOO MUST SUFFER IT IF THERE IS A MUTINY YOU AND YOUR CAPTAINS SHALL BE HELD PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE THE MISTAKE YOU MAKE IS IN ASSUMING WITH ME THE TONE OF AN ALLY
BLOOD WAS REDUCED TO DESPAIR IF HE WENT OFF NOW HEAVEN KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE TOWN THE TEMPER OF THOSE WHOM HE WAS LEAVING BEING WHAT IT WAS YET IF HE REMAINED IT WOULD SIMPLY MEAN THAT HIS OWN AND HAGTHORPE'S CREWS
KANE AYE THE WOLF WAS TOO MUCH AT SEA TO LIE KEEP CLOSE WATCH LA MON IN A MOMENT THE RAT AND I WILL JOIN YOU THE FACE WITHDREW AND LE LOUP TURNED TO THE OTHER
HOW CAN WE SHARE THE SPOIL BEFORE IT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY GATHERED MY MEN HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS GATHERED AND ANYWAY THEY VIEW WITH MISTRUST THAT IT SHOULD ALL BE HOUSED ABOARD YOUR SHIPS AND REMAIN IN YOUR POSSESSION
A SWORDSMAN SECOND ONLY TO YOURSELF GOES FORTH SWEARING TO MEET THIS KANE BY THE DEMONS OF PERDITION IT SEEMS HE MET HIM FOR WE FOUND HIS SWORD PIERCED CORPSE UPON A CLIFF WHAT NOW ARE WE ALL TO FALL BEFORE THIS ENGLISH FIEND TRUE
NOM D'UN NOM WE CAN GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS KANE LEANED FORWARD A TERRIBLE BROODING THREAT GROWING IN HIS COLD EYES HE SEEMED LIKE A GREAT CONDOR ABOUT TO LAUNCH HIMSELF UPON HIS VICTIM SIR DO YOU ASSUME ME TO BE AS GREAT A VILLAIN AS YOURSELF
POSSIBLY YOU WILL SAY THAT YOU ARE MERELY A NOBLE CAVALIER WANDERING ABOUT LIKE A TRUE GALAHAD PROTECTING THE WEAKER BUT YOU AND I KNOW DIFFERENT THERE ON THE FLOOR IS THE EQUIVALENT TO AN EMPEROR'S RANSOM LET US DIVIDE IT PEACEABLY THEN IF YOU LIKE NOT MY COMPANY WHY
THE VOICE TRAILED OFF IN SILENCE THE DEAD MAN SLID FROM THE TABLE TO LIE IN A RED HEAP UPON THE FLOOR LIKE SATAN BABBLED THE OTHER BANDIT I TOLD YOU TIS THE HORNED ONE HIMSELF I TELL YOU HE CEASED AS A FRIGHTENED FACE PEERED IN AT THE CAVE ENTRANCE

ARE SEEN AMONG THE LEAVES WHEN TWO YOUNG LADIES ARE OCCASIONALLY FOUND GAMBOLLING IN SEQUESTERED SAW PITS AND SUCH NOOKS OF THE PARK AND WHEN THE SMOKE OF TWO PIPES WREATHES AWAY INTO THE FRAGRANT EVENING AIR FROM THE TROOPER'S DOOR
THE PONY CAME TROTTING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET LOOKING AS OBSTINATE AS PONY MIGHT AND PICKING HIS STEPS AS IF HE WERE SPYING ABOUT FOR THE CLEANEST PLACES AND WOULD BY NO MEANS DIRTY HIS FEET OR HURRY HIMSELF INCONVENIENTLY
PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO CATCH SIGHT OF THE OTHER BRASS PLATE OR PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WAS IN A SPITEFUL HUMOUR DARTED OFF WITH THE OLD LADY AND STOPPED AT THE RIGHT HOUSE LEAVING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO COME PANTING ON BEHIND
AND BEFORE ASSISTANCE COULD BE RENDERED COMMENCED BACKING AT NEARLY AS QUICK A PACE AS HE HAD GONE FORWARD BY THESE MEANS MISTER CHUCKSTER WAS PUSHED AND HUSTLED TO THE OFFICE AGAIN IN A MOST INGLORIOUS MANNER AND ARRIVED IN A STATE OF GREAT EXHAUSTION AND DISCOMFITURE
AND IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT HE HAD COME AND GONE AGAIN IN SO SHORT A SPACE GREATLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT HE WAS NOT TOO LATE KIT LEANT AGAINST A LAMP POST TO TAKE BREATH AND WAITED THE ADVENT OF THE PONY AND HIS CHARGE SURE ENOUGH BEFORE LONG
AND SONOROUSLY REPEATING HER LAST WORDS BEGS WITH SOME DISPLEASURE TO KNOW IF SHE FINDS HERSELF FATIGUED HOWEVER VOLUMNIA IN THE COURSE OF HER BIRD LIKE HOPPING ABOUT AND PECKING AT PAPERS HAS ALIGHTED ON A MEMORANDUM
I MIGHT SUPPOSE TIME TO HAVE STOOD FOR SEVEN YEARS AS STILL AS THE MILL DID HALF AN HOUR AGO SINCE LITTLE EMMA CHARLEY'S SISTER IS EXACTLY WHAT CHARLEY USED TO BE AS TO TOM CHARLEY'S BROTHER
AND CASTING THEIR TEARS UPON THE WINDOW PANES IN MONOTONOUS DEPRESSIONS A LABYRINTH OF GRANDEUR LESS THE PROPERTY OF AN OLD FAMILY OF HUMAN BEINGS AND THEIR GHOSTLY LIKENESSES THAN OF AN OLD FAMILY OF ECHOINGS AND THUNDERINGS
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING ABOUT MY DEAR SAID ALLAN THEN HOW CURIOUS YOU ARE SAID I I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO TELL YOU BUT I WILL I HAVE BEEN THINKING
NO FLAG FLYING NOW BY DAY NO ROWS OF LIGHTS SPARKLING BY NIGHT WITH NO FAMILY TO COME AND GO NO VISITORS TO BE THE SOULS OF PALE COLD SHAPES OF ROOMS NO STIR OF LIFE ABOUT IT
LIKE CHARMERS REDUCED TO FLIRTING WITH GRIM DEATH AFTER LOSING ALL THEIR OTHER BEAUX DID ONCE OCCASIONALLY SAY WHEN THE WORLD ASSEMBLED TOGETHER THAT THEY WONDERED THE ASHES OF THE DEDLOCKS ENTOMBED IN THE MAUSOLEUM
TO WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN ARE SOON PENNED THEN I AND THE UNKNOWN FRIEND TO WHOM I WRITE WILL PART FOR EVER NOT WITHOUT MUCH DEAR REMEMBRANCE ON MY SIDE NOT WITHOUT SOME I HOPE ON HIS OR HERS
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE KING OF BORRIOBOOLA WANTING TO SELL EVERYBODY WHO SURVIVED THE CLIMATE FOR RUM BUT SHE HAS TAKEN UP WITH THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO SIT IN PARLIAMENT
THEY GAVE MY DARLING INTO MY ARMS AND THROUGH MANY WEEKS I NEVER LEFT HER THE LITTLE CHILD WHO WAS TO HAVE DONE SO MUCH WAS BORN BEFORE THE TURF WAS PLANTED ON ITS FATHER'S GRAVE IT WAS A BOY
IS NOT THIS TO BE RICH THE PEOPLE EVEN PRAISE ME AS THE DOCTOR'S WIFE THE PEOPLE EVEN LIKE ME AS I GO ABOUT AND MAKE SO MUCH OF ME THAT I AM QUITE ABASHED I OWE IT ALL TO HIM MY LOVE
AND WITH HIS BIRD UPON HIS HEAD TO HOLD FORTH VEHEMENTLY AGAINST SIR LEICESTER IN THE SANCTUARY OF HIS OWN HOME SIMILARLY ALSO HE DEFIES HIM AS OF OLD IN THE LITTLE CHURCH BY TESTIFYING A BLAND UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS EXISTENCE
SHOWING HOW BUFFY IS IMMACULATE AND BOODLE VILLAINOUS AND HOW THE COUNTRY IS LOST BY BEING ALL BOODLE AND NO BUFFY OR SAVED BY BEING ALL BUFFY AND NO BOODLE
I HOPE THE MILLER WILL NOT SPOIL CHARLEY BUT HE IS VERY FOND OF HER AND CHARLEY IS RATHER VAIN OF SUCH A MATCH FOR HE IS WELL TO DO AND WAS IN GREAT REQUEST SO FAR AS MY SMALL MAID IS CONCERNED
YOU DON'T THINK THEY'VE GONE TO SEA ANYHOW NOT GONE FOR SAILORS CERTAINLY RETURNED THE MOTHER WITH A SMILE BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT THEY HAVE GONE TO SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY I SAY
TO HOLD THEIR PEACE BUT IT IS A LAME STORY FEEBLY WHISPERING AND CREEPING ABOUT AND ANY BRIGHTER SPARK OF LIFE IT SHOWS SOON DIES AWAY IT IS KNOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT THE HANDSOME LADY DEDLOCK
IT WAS THEN THAT KIT PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE PONY'S HEAD AND TOUCHED HIS HAT WITH A SMILE
DAME TROT DAME DURDEN LITTLE WOMAN ALL JUST THE SAME AS EVER AND I ANSWER YES DEAR GUARDIAN JUST THE SAME I HAVE NEVER KNOWN THE WIND TO BE IN THE EAST
IN THE LONG DRAWING ROOM FOR ALL THAT AND REPOSES IN HIS OLD PLACE BEFORE MY LADY'S PICTURE CLOSED IN BY NIGHT WITH BROAD SCREENS AND ILLUMINED ONLY IN THAT PART
NOT UNLIKE AN OLD DOG OF SOME MONGREL BREED WHO HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY KNOCKED ABOUT HE ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF PHIL A GOODLY SIGHT IT IS TO SEE THE GRAND OLD HOUSEKEEPER HARDER OF HEARING NOW GOING TO CHURCH ON THE ARM OF HER SON
THE MOON IS SHINING SO BRIGHTLY ALLAN AND THE NIGHT IS SO DELICIOUS
SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THIS IS AN UNCOMMON LAD A GOOD LAD I'M SURE I'M SURE HE IS REJOINED THE OLD LADY
TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH IN ONE OF THE LODGES OF THE PARK THAT LODGE WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE WHERE ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WATERS WERE OUT DOWN IN LINCOLNSHIRE MY LADY USED TO SEE THE KEEPER'S CHILD THE STALWART MAN
CADDY KEEPS HER OWN LITTLE CARRIAGE NOW INSTEAD OF HIRING ONE AND LIVES FULL TWO MILES FURTHER WESTWARD THAN NEWMAN STREET SHE WORKS VERY HARD HER HUSBAND AN EXCELLENT ONE BEING LAME
AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HAVING ANTICIPATED IT IN HIS OWN MIND AND KNOWING HOW JUST IT WAS BUT THE IMPULSE WAS ONLY MOMENTARY AND THE VEXED LOOK BECAME A KIND ONE BEFORE IT HAD CROSSED THE ROOM
I SAID I'D BE HERE SIR SAID KIT PATTING WHISKER'S NECK I HOPE YOU'VE HAD A PLEASANT RIDE SIR HE'S A VERY NICE LITTLE PONY MY
AS LITTLE DOES HE THINK HOW NEAR TOGETHER HE AND HIS ANTAGONIST HAVE SUFFERED IN THE FORTUNES OF TWO SISTERS AND HIS ANTAGONIST WHO KNOWS IT NOW IS NOT THE MAN TO TELL HIM SO THE QUARREL GOES ON
THE SORROW THAT HAS BEEN IN HER FACE FOR IT IS NOT THERE NOW SEEMS TO HAVE PURIFIED EVEN ITS INNOCENT EXPRESSION AND TO HAVE GIVEN IT A DIVINER QUALITY SOMETIMES WHEN I RAISE MY EYES AND SEE HER
AND THE LIKE WHICH BY A PONY OF SPIRIT CANNOT BE BORNE
KIT COULD NOT HELP FEELING PRESENTLY MISTER WITHERDEN SMELLING VERY HARD AT THE NOSEGAY CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT HIM AND AFTER THAT MISTER ABEL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM
IT WAS SOME TWO MINUTES AFTER THE TIME WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT WHICH WAS A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM HIS HOME BUT BY GREAT GOOD LUCK THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD NOT YET ARRIVED AT LEAST THERE WAS NO PONY CHAISE TO BE SEEN
THEY MAY BE WRONG OF COURSE RETURNED THE MOTHER I CAN'T TELL ABOUT THAT THOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S AT ALL UNLIKELY THAT THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT FOR THE TALK IS THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN
STATELY AND UNASSUMING VARIOUS BEAUTIFULLY WILFUL THEN IS THERE A SINGULAR KIND OF PARALLEL BETWEEN HER AND THE LITTLE GLASS CHANDELIERS OF ANOTHER AGE EMBELLISHING THAT ASSEMBLY ROOM WHICH
HER DEAREST COUSIN JOHN BUT HE SAID NO IT MUST BE GUARDIAN NOW HE WAS HER GUARDIAN HENCEFORTH AND THE BOY'S AND HE HAD AN OLD ASSOCIATION WITH THE NAME
NEVER ROSE AGAINST THE PROFANATION OF HER COMPANY BUT THE DEAD AND GONE DEDLOCKS TAKE IT VERY CALMLY AND HAVE NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO OBJECT UP FROM AMONG THE FERN IN THE HOLLOW
CADDY JELLYBY PASSED HER VERY LAST HOLIDAYS WITH US AND WAS A DEARER CREATURE THAN EVER PERPETUALLY DANCING IN AND OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH THE CHILDREN AS IF SHE HAD NEVER GIVEN A DANCING LESSON IN HER LIFE
WITH THEIR MEAGRE STEMS THEIR SPARE LITTLE DROPS THEIR DISAPPOINTING KNOBS WHERE NO DROPS ARE THEIR BARE LITTLE STALKS FROM WHICH KNOBS AND DROPS HAVE BOTH DEPARTED AND THEIR LITTLE FEEBLE PRISMATIC TWINKLING
HE IS MY HUSBAND'S BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND HE IS OUR CHILDREN'S DARLING HE IS THE OBJECT OF OUR DEEPEST LOVE AND VENERATION YET WHILE I FEEL TOWARDS HIM AS IF HE WERE A SUPERIOR BEING I AM SO FAMILIAR WITH HIM
ARE THE STAPLE OF HER READING SIR LEICESTER IS NOT PARTICULAR WHAT IT IS AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO FOLLOW IT VERY CLOSELY FURTHER THAN THAT HE ALWAYS COMES BROAD AWAKE THE MOMENT VOLUMNIA VENTURES TO LEAVE OFF
AND THEY WILL NEVER BE DISTURBED THAT DON'T SEEM VERY FAR OUT OF THE WAY NOW DO IT KIT SCRATCHED HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY IN RELUCTANT ADMISSION THAT IT DID NOT AND CLAMBERING UP TO THE OLD NAIL TOOK DOWN THE CAGE
THE CLOSE OF ESTHER'S NARRATIVE
COMES SOMETIMES TO THIS LONELY SPOT THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOFS THEN MAY BE SEEN SIR LEICESTER INVALIDED BENT AND ALMOST BLIND BUT OF WORTHY PRESENCE YET
THEN IS A FIFE HEARD TROLLING WITHIN THE LODGE ON THE INSPIRING TOPIC OF THE BRITISH GRENADIERS AND AS THE EVENING CLOSES IN A GRUFF INFLEXIBLE VOICE IS HEARD TO SAY WHILE TWO MEN PACE TOGETHER UP AND DOWN BUT
THE TROOPER FORMERLY IS HOUSED SOME RELICS OF HIS OLD CALLING HANG UPON THE WALLS AND THESE IT IS THE CHOSEN RECREATION OF A LITTLE LAME MAN ABOUT THE STABLE YARD TO KEEP GLEAMING BRIGHT A BUSY LITTLE MAN HE ALWAYS IS
EVEN TO THE STRANGER'S EYE HAVE DIED AWAY FROM THE PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE
AND I AM ONE WE ARE NOT RICH IN THE BANK BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS PROSPERED AND WE HAVE QUITE ENOUGH
AND OCCASIONALLY INSULTING HIM WITH SUCH ADMONITIONS AS STAND STILL
AND TO OBSERVE WHICH FEW DO FOR THE HOUSE IS SCANT OF COMPANY IN THESE TIMES THE RELATIONS OF BOTH TOWARDS SIR LEICESTER AND HIS TOWARDS THEM THEY HAVE VISITORS IN THE HIGH SUMMER WEATHER WHEN A GREY CLOAK AND UMBRELLA
INVOLVING MORE CORRESPONDENCE THAN THE OLD ONE I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN CADDY'S POOR LITTLE GIRL SHE IS NOT SUCH A MITE NOW BUT SHE IS DEAF AND DUMB I BELIEVE THERE NEVER WAS A BETTER MOTHER THAN CADDY
ABOUT MY OLD LOOKS SUCH AS THEY WERE
MY PRIDE THEY LIKE ME FOR HIS SAKE AS I DO EVERYTHING I DO IN LIFE FOR HIS SAKE A NIGHT OR TWO AGO AFTER BUSTLING ABOUT PREPARING FOR MY DARLING AND MY GUARDIAN AND LITTLE RICHARD WHO ARE COMING TO MORROW
IS STILL BELIEVED IN IN THE OLD WAY HE IS CONSTANT IN HIS PATRONAGE OF PEEPY AND IS UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE BEQUEATHED HIM
THE PONY HAVING THOROUGHLY SATISFIED HIMSELF AS TO THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE FIRE PLUG LOOKED INTO THE AIR AFTER HIS OLD ENEMIES THE FLIES
AND RAISED HOPE WITHIN HER I FELT A NEW SENSE OF THE GOODNESS AND THE TENDERNESS OF GOD THEY THROVE AND BY DEGREES I SAW MY DEAR GIRL PASS INTO MY COUNTRY GARDEN AND WALK THERE WITH HER INFANT IN HER ARMS
SO SHE CALLED HIM GUARDIAN AND HAS CALLED HIM GUARDIAN EVER SINCE THE CHILDREN KNOW HIM BY NO OTHER NAME I SAY THE CHILDREN I HAVE TWO LITTLE DAUGHTERS IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT CHARLEY
AND AFTER THAT THEY ALL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM TOGETHER WHICH KIT FEELING VERY MUCH EMBARRASSED BY MADE A PRETENCE OF NOT OBSERVING THEREFORE HE PATTED THE PONY MORE AND MORE AND THIS LIBERTY THE PONY MOST HANDSOMELY PERMITTED
FOURTEEN HEAVY MILES OFF WHICH DURING THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS OF EVERY ORDINARY YEAR IS A KIND OF ANTIPODEAN LUMBER ROOM FULL OF OLD CHAIRS AND TABLES UPSIDE DOWN
IS STILL FOR A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THEY RIDE AWAY WAR RAGES YET WITH THE AUDACIOUS BOYTHORN THOUGH AT UNCERTAIN INTERVALS AND NOW HOTLY AND NOW COOLLY FLICKERING LIKE AN UNSTEADY FIRE
THE FACES HAD NOT DISAPPEARED FROM THE WINDOW MANY MOMENTS WHEN MISTER CHUCKSTER IN HIS OFFICIAL COAT AND WITH HIS HAT HANGING ON HIS HEAD JUST AS IT HAPPENED TO FALL FROM ITS PEG APPEARED UPON THE PAVEMENT
WHICH IS NOT HIS PROPERTY WITH THE FIRST MONEY WE SAVED AT HOME WE ADDED TO OUR PRETTY HOUSE BY THROWING OUT A LITTLE GROWLERY EXPRESSLY FOR MY GUARDIAN WHICH WE INAUGURATED WITH GREAT SPLENDOUR THE NEXT TIME HE CAME DOWN TO SEE US
AND I MY HUSBAND AND MY GUARDIAN GAVE HIM HIS FATHER'S NAME THE HELP THAT MY DEAR COUNTED ON DID COME TO HER THOUGH IT CAME IN THE ETERNAL WISDOM FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE
MISTER BOYTHORN SHOWED A MANIFEST DESIRE TO ABANDON HIS RIGHT OF WAY AND DO WHATEVER SIR LEICESTER WOULD WHICH SIR LEICESTER CONCEIVING TO BE A CONDESCENSION TO HIS ILLNESS OR MISFORTUNE TOOK IN SUCH HIGH DUDGEON AND WAS SO MAGNIFICENTLY AGGRIEVED BY
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WHISKED HIS TAIL AFTER WHICH HE APPEARED FULL OF THOUGHT BUT QUITE COMFORTABLE AND COLLECTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN HAVING EXHAUSTED HIS POWERS OF PERSUASION ALIGHTED TO LEAD HIM WHEREUPON THE PONY PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HELD THIS TO BE A SUFFICIENT CONCESSION
HAD IN HIS EYES AN AWFUL AND VENERABLE AIR MISTER WITHERDEN TOO WAS A BUSTLING GENTLEMAN WHO TALKED LOUD AND FAST AND ALL EYES WERE UPON HIM AND HE WAS VERY SHABBY
I WAS SITTING OUT IN THE PORCH OF ALL PLACES THAT DEARLY MEMORABLE PORCH WHEN ALLAN CAME HOME SO HE SAID MY PRECIOUS LITTLE WOMAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AND I SAID
I AM REALLY AFRAID TO SAY WHAT HE DID AT SCHOOL IN CIPHERING BUT I THINK IT WAS DECIMALS HE IS APPRENTICED TO THE MILLER WHATEVER IT WAS AND IS A GOOD BASHFUL FELLOW ALWAYS FALLING IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY AND BEING ASHAMED OF IT
IN THE POLISHING AT HARNESS HOUSE DOORS OF STIRRUP IRONS BITS CURB CHAINS HARNESS BOSSES ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF A STABLE YARD THAT WILL TAKE A POLISH LEADING A LIFE OF FRICTION A SHAGGY LITTLE DAMAGED MAN WITHAL
AND TELLING HIM HE WAS WANTED INSIDE BADE HIM GO IN AND HE WOULD MIND THE CHAISE THE WHILE IN GIVING HIM THIS DIRECTION MISTER CHUCKSTER REMARKED THAT HE WISHED THAT HE MIGHT BE BLESSED IF HE COULD MAKE OUT WHETHER HE KIT
IS ALL MYSTERY SOME OF HER OLD FRIENDS PRINCIPALLY TO BE FOUND AMONG THE PEACHY CHEEKED CHARMERS WITH THE SKELETON THROATS DID ONCE OCCASIONALLY SAY AS THEY TOYED IN A GHASTLY MANNER WITH LARGE FANS
THEY SURELY COULDN'T STOP AWAY MORE THAN A WEEK COULD THEY NOW THE MOTHER SHOOK HER HEAD AND REMINDED HIM HOW OFTEN HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED ALREADY FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SAID KIT
HAD AT LENGTH STARTED OFF AND WAS AT THAT MOMENT RATTLING DOWN THE STREET MISTER CHUCKSTER WITH HIS HAT OFF AND A PEN BEHIND HIS EAR HANGING ON IN THE REAR OF THE CHAISE AND MAKING FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO DRAW IT THE OTHER WAY TO THE UNSPEAKABLE ADMIRATION OF ALL BEHOLDERS
THE OLD LADY THEN STEPPED INTO HER SEAT AND MISTER ABEL WHOM THEY HAD COME TO FETCH INTO HIS
THEN DOES SHE TWIRL AND TWINE A PASTORAL NYMPH OF GOOD FAMILY THROUGH THE MAZES OF THE DANCE THEN DO THE SWAINS APPEAR WITH TEA WITH LEMONADE WITH SANDWICHES WITH HOMAGE THEN IS SHE KIND AND CRUEL
I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANYTHING THANK YOU SIR KIT REPLIED AND QUITE SERIOUSLY TOO FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SEEMED TO FREE HIM FROM THE SUSPICION WHICH THE NOTARY HAD HINTED BUT RESUMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
ALL SEEM VOLUMNIAS FOR THE REST LINCOLNSHIRE LIFE TO VOLUMNIA IS A VAST BLANK OF OVERGROWN HOUSE LOOKING OUT UPON TREES SIGHING WRINGING THEIR HANDS BOWING THEIR HEADS
FOR A SINGLE MOMENT SINCE THE DAY WHEN HE TOOK ME TO THE PORCH TO READ THE NAME I REMARKED TO HIM ONCE THAT THE WIND SEEMED NEVER IN THE EAST NOW AND HE SAID NO TRULY IT HAD FINALLY DEPARTED FROM THAT QUARTER ON THAT VERY DAY
THUS CHESNEY WOLD WITH SO MUCH OF ITSELF ABANDONED TO DARKNESS AND VACANCY WITH SO LITTLE CHANGE UNDER THE SUMMER SHINING OR THE WINTRY LOWERING SO SOMBRE AND MOTIONLESS ALWAYS
SAID THE NOTARY DEAD SIR MOTHER YES SIR MARRIED AGAIN EH KIT MADE ANSWER NOT WITHOUT SOME INDIGNATION THAT SHE WAS A WIDOW WITH THREE CHILDREN
WHEN SOMETHING IS TO BE DONE FOR THE COUNTY OR THE COUNTRY IN THE WAY OF GRACING A PUBLIC BALL THEN INDEED DOES THE TUCKERED SYLPH COME OUT IN FAIRY FORM AND PROCEED WITH JOY UNDER COUSINLY ESCORT TO THE EXHAUSTED OLD ASSEMBLY ROOM
SUCH FERNAL OLD JAIL'S NOUGH T'SEW FLER UP FREVER THE ONLY GREAT OCCASIONS FOR VOLUMNIA IN THIS CHANGED ASPECT OF THE PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE ARE THOSE OCCASIONS RARE AND WIDELY SEPARATED
CHAPTER TWENTY DAY AFTER DAY AS HE BENT HIS STEPS HOMEWARD RETURNING FROM SOME NEW EFFORT TO PROCURE EMPLOYMENT KIT RAISED HIS EYES TO THE WINDOW OF THE LITTLE ROOM HE HAD SO MUCH COMMENDED TO THE CHILD
YOU SPEAK TRUE AND SENSIBLE ENOUGH AS YOU ALWAYS DO MOTHER STILL
SAID MISTER WITHERDEN YOU CAME TO WORK OUT THAT SHILLING NOT TO GET ANOTHER HEY NO INDEED SIR REPLIED KIT TAKING COURAGE TO LOOK UP I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING FATHER ALIVE
I WAS MARRIED THEN I WAS THE HAPPIEST OF THE HAPPY IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT MY GUARDIAN JOINED US AND ASKED ADA WHEN SHE WOULD COME HOME BOTH HOUSES ARE YOUR HOME MY DEAR
AND HOPED TO SEE SOME INDICATION OF HER PRESENCE HIS OWN EARNEST WISH COUPLED WITH THE ASSURANCE HE HAD RECEIVED FROM QUILP FILLED HIM WITH THE BELIEF THAT SHE WOULD YET ARRIVE TO CLAIM THE HUMBLE SHELTER HE HAD OFFERED AND FROM THE DEATH OF EACH DAY'S HOPE
WHO LEARNS IN HER SCANTY INTERVALS OF LEISURE INNUMERABLE DEAF AND DUMB ARTS TO SOFTEN THE AFFLICTION OF HER CHILD AS IF I WERE NEVER TO HAVE DONE WITH CADDY I AM REMINDED HERE OF PEEPY AND OLD MISTER TURVEYDROP
I TRY TO WRITE ALL THIS LIGHTLY BECAUSE MY HEART IS FULL IN DRAWING TO AN END BUT WHEN I WRITE OF HIM MY TEARS WILL HAVE THEIR WAY I NEVER LOOK AT HIM BUT I HEAR
SAID HE BUT THE OLDER BLEAK HOUSE CLAIMS PRIORITY WHEN YOU AND MY BOY ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO DO IT COME AND TAKE POSSESSION OF YOUR HOME ADA CALLED HIM
DON'T YOU SAY SO QUITE LONG ENOUGH KIT LONGER THAN ENOUGH BUT THEY MAY NOT COME BACK FOR ALL THAT KIT WAS FOR A MOMENT DISPOSED TO BE VEXED BY THIS CONTRADICTION
PERHAPS I MAY WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT YOU SO TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE AND I'LL PUT IT DOWN IN MY POCKET BOOK
BUT I HEAR THE PEOPLE BLESS HIM I NEVER GO INTO A HOUSE OF ANY DEGREE BUT I HEAR HIS PRAISES OR SEE THEM IN GRATEFUL EYES I NEVER LIE DOWN AT NIGHT BUT I KNOW THAT IN THE COURSE OF THAT DAY HE HAS ALLEVIATED PAIN
ROUND EYED STILL AND NOT AT ALL GRAMMATICAL IS MARRIED TO A MILLER IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD YET SO IT IS AND EVEN NOW LOOKING UP FROM MY DESK AS I WRITE EARLY IN THE MORNING AT MY SUMMER WINDOW I SEE THE VERY MILL BEGINNING TO GO ROUND
I HAVE BEEN THE MISTRESS OF BLEAK HOUSE
AND IS DRIVEN TO VARIOUS ARTIFICES TO CONCEAL HER YAWNS OF WHICH THE CHIEF AND MOST EFFICACIOUS IS THE INSERTION OF THE PEARL NECKLACE BETWEEN HER ROSY LIPS LONG WINDED TREATISES ON THE BUFFY AND BOODLE QUESTION
THERE IS A HUSH UPON CHESNEY WOLD IN THESE ALTERED DAYS AS THERE IS UPON A PORTION OF THE FAMILY HISTORY
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN MY DEAR FOR IT'S A VERY HARD ONE
ANOTHER HOPE SPRUNG UP TO LIVE TO MORROW I THINK THEY MUST CERTAINLY COME TO MORROW EH MOTHER SAID KIT LAYING ASIDE HIS HAT WITH A WEARY AIR AND SIGHING AS HE SPOKE THEY HAVE BEEN GONE A WEEK
AND SOOTHED SOME FELLOW CREATURE IN THE TIME OF NEED I KNOW THAT FROM THE BEDS OF THOSE WHO WERE PAST RECOVERY THANKS HAVE OFTEN OFTEN GONE UP IN THE LAST HOUR FOR HIS PATIENT MINISTRATION
WHICH START OUT OF THEIR HUNDRED GRAVES AT EVERY SOUND AND GO RESOUNDING THROUGH THE BUILDING A WASTE OF UNUSED PASSAGES AND STAIRCASES IN WHICH TO DROP A COMB UPON A BEDROOM FLOOR AT NIGHT IS TO SEND A STEALTHY FOOTFALL ON AN ERRAND THROUGH THE HOUSE
BUT IT IS WHISPERED THAT WHEN HE IS MOST FEROCIOUS TOWARDS HIS OLD FOE HE IS REALLY MOST CONSIDERATE AND THAT SIR LEICESTER IN THE DIGNITY OF BEING IMPLACABLE LITTLE SUPPOSES HOW MUCH HE IS HUMOURED
OUR POOR DEAR RICHARD CALLING HIM A GOOD MAN TO ADA AND HER PRETTY BOY HE IS THE FONDEST FATHER TO ME HE IS WHAT HE HAS EVER BEEN AND WHAT NAME CAN I GIVE TO THAT
BEHIND THE PONY SAT THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN AND BY THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE SAT THE LITTLE OLD LADY CARRYING JUST SUCH A NOSEGAY AS SHE HAD BROUGHT BEFORE THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE OLD LADY THE PONY AND THE CHAISE
THEN INDEED DOES SHE CAPTIVATE ALL HEARTS BY HER CONDESCENSION BY HER GIRLISH VIVACITY AND BY HER SKIPPING ABOUT AS IN THE DAYS WHEN THE HIDEOUS OLD GENERAL WITH THE MOUTH TOO FULL OF TEETH HAD NOT CUT ONE OF THEM AT TWO GUINEAS EACH
THOUGH TO BLESS AND RESTORE HIS MOTHER NOT HIS FATHER WAS THE ERRAND OF THIS BABY ITS POWER WAS MIGHTY TO DO IT WHEN I SAW THE STRENGTH OF THE WEAK LITTLE HAND AND HOW ITS TOUCH COULD HEAL MY DARLING'S HEART
I NEVER OWN TO IT BEFORE THE OLD GIRL DISCIPLINE MUST BE MAINTAINED THE GREATER PART OF THE HOUSE IS SHUT UP AND IT IS A SHOW HOUSE NO LONGER YET SIR LEICESTER HOLDS HIS SHRUNKEN STATE
IN THE BLACK DRESS THAT SHE STILL WEARS TEACHING MY RICHARD I FEEL
FOR LOW SPIRITED TWOS AND THREES OF COUSINS THE DEBILITATED COUSIN MORE DEBILITATED BY THE DREARINESS OF THE PLACE GETS INTO A FEARFUL STATE OF DEPRESSION GROANING UNDER PENITENTIAL SOFA PILLOWS IN HIS GUNLESS HOURS AND PROTESTING THAT
THE COUSINS GENERALLY ARE RATHER SHY OF CHESNEY WOLD IN ITS DULLNESS BUT TAKE TO IT A LITTLE IN THE SHOOTING SEASON WHEN GUNS ARE HEARD IN THE PLANTATIONS AND A FEW SCATTERED BEATERS AND KEEPERS WAIT AT THE OLD PLACES OF APPOINTMENT
AND LOOKS SO OBDURATE WILL HAVE OPENED AND RECEIVED HIM VOLUMNIA GROWING WITH THE FLIGHT OF TIME PINKER AS TO THE RED IN HER FACE AND YELLOWER AS TO THE WHITE READS TO SIR LEICESTER IN THE LONG EVENINGS
OR PRECIOUS DEEP BUT INTIMATED BY A DISTRUSTFUL SHAKE OF THE HEAD THAT HE INCLINED TO THE LATTER OPINION KIT ENTERED THE OFFICE IN A GREAT TREMOR FOR HE WAS NOT USED TO GOING AMONG STRANGE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND THE TIN BOXES AND BUNDLES OF DUSTY PAPERS
THAT MISTER BOYTHORN FOUND HIMSELF UNDER THE NECESSITY OF COMMITTING A FLAGRANT TRESPASS TO RESTORE HIS NEIGHBOUR TO HIMSELF SIMILARLY MISTER BOYTHORN CONTINUES TO POST TREMENDOUS PLACARDS ON THE DISPUTED THOROUGHFARE
AND SO EASY WITH HIM THAT I ALMOST WONDER AT MYSELF I HAVE NEVER LOST MY OLD NAMES NOR HAS HE LOST HIS NOR DO I EVER WHEN HE IS WITH US SIT IN ANY OTHER PLACE THAN IN MY OLD CHAIR AT HIS SIDE
VERY LITTLE STILL SHE IS MORE THAN CONTENTED AND DOES ALL SHE HAS TO DO WITH ALL HER HEART MISTER JELLYBY SPENDS HIS EVENINGS AT HER NEW HOUSE WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL AS HE USED TO DO IN HER OLD ONE
AND THE OLD LADY HURRYING TO THE WINDOW CRIED THAT WHISKER HAD RUN AWAY UPON WHICH KIT DARTED OUT TO THE RESCUE AND THE OTHERS FOLLOWED
CONCERNING HERSELF IN THE EVENT OF ANYTHING HAPPENING TO HER KINSMAN WHICH IS HANDSOME COMPENSATION FOR AN EXTENSIVE COURSE OF READING AND HOLDS EVEN THE DRAGON BOREDOM AT BAY
SAID ALLAN I HAVE BEEN THINKING THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE LOVED ME ANY BETTER EVEN IF I HAD RETAINED THEM SUCH AS THEY WERE SAID ALLAN LAUGHING
EVEN IN RUNNING AWAY HOWEVER WHISKER WAS PERVERSE
LIES IN THE MAUSOLEUM IN THE PARK WHERE THE TREES ARCH DARKLY OVERHEAD AND THE OWL IS HEARD AT NIGHT MAKING THE WOODS RING BUT WHENCE SHE WAS BROUGHT HOME TO BE LAID AMONG THE ECHOES OF THAT SOLITARY PLACE OR HOW SHE DIED
CRIED KIT WITH A RUEFUL FACE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT MOTHER I AM AFRAID THEY HAVE AND THAT'S THE TRUTH SHE SAID IT'S THE TALK OF ALL THE NEIGHBOURS AND THERE ARE SOME EVEN THAT KNOW OF THEIR HAVING BEEN SEEN ON BOARD SHIP
A PLACE WHERE FEW PEOPLE CARE TO GO ABOUT ALONE WHERE A MAID SCREAMS IF AN ASH DROPS FROM THE FIRE TAKES TO CRYING AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS BECOMES THE VICTIM OF A LOW DISORDER OF THE SPIRITS AND GIVES WARNING AND DEPARTS
PEEPY IS IN THE CUSTOM HOUSE AND DOING EXTREMELY WELL OLD MISTER TURVEYDROP VERY APOPLECTIC STILL EXHIBITS HIS DEPORTMENT ABOUT TOWN STILL ENJOYS HIMSELF IN THE OLD MANNER
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE PONY LOOKED WITH GREAT ATTENTION INTO A FIRE PLUG WHICH WAS NEAR HIM
KIT ACKNOWLEDGED THESE EXPRESSIONS OF CONFIDENCE BY TOUCHING HIS HAT AGAIN AND BLUSHING VERY MUCH THE OLD GENTLEMAN THEN HANDED THE OLD LADY OUT AND AFTER LOOKING AT HIM WITH AN APPROVING SMILE THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE TALKING ABOUT HIM AS THEY WENT
RIDING WITH A STALWART MAN BESIDE HIM CONSTANT TO HIS BRIDLE REIN WHEN THEY COME TO A CERTAIN SPOT BEFORE THE MAUSOLEUM DOOR SIR LEICESTER'S ACCUSTOMED HORSE STOPS OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND SIR LEICESTER PULLING OFF HIS HAT
I HAVE HEARD THAT MISSUS JELLYBY WAS UNDERSTOOD TO SUFFER GREAT MORTIFICATION FROM HER DAUGHTER'S IGNOBLE MARRIAGE AND PURSUITS BUT I HOPE SHE GOT OVER IT IN TIME SHE HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTED
AND SET HIMSELF TO CLEAN IT AND TO FEED THE BIRD HIS THOUGHTS REVERTING FROM THIS OCCUPATION TO THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE SHILLING HE SUDDENLY RECOLLECTED THAT THAT WAS THE VERY DAY NAY NEARLY THE VERY HOUR
CAME UP THE STREET IN PERFECT UNANIMITY UNTIL THEY ARRIVED WITHIN SOME HALF A DOZEN DOORS OF THE NOTARY'S HOUSE WHEN THE PONY DECEIVED BY A BRASS PLATE BENEATH A TAILOR'S KNOCKER CAME TO A HALT AND MAINTAINED BY A STURDY SILENCE THAT THAT WAS THE HOUSE THEY WANTED
THE LIGHT OF THE DRAWING ROOM SEEMS GRADUALLY CONTRACTING AND DWINDLING UNTIL IT SHALL BE NO MORE A LITTLE MORE IN TRUTH AND IT WILL BE ALL EXTINGUISHED FOR SIR LEICESTER AND THE DAMP DOOR IN THE MAUSOLEUM WHICH SHUTS SO TIGHT
AT WHICH THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN HAD SAID HE SHOULD BE AT THE NOTARY'S HOUSE AGAIN HE NO SOONER REMEMBERED THIS THAN HE HUNG UP THE CAGE WITH GREAT PRECIPITATION AND HASTILY EXPLAINING THE NATURE OF HIS ERRAND WENT OFF AT FULL SPEED TO THE APPOINTED PLACE
SHE HAS SO MUCH TASTE OF COURSE IT'S ALL NONE OF MY BUSINESS BUT I FEEL HAPPIER SINCE I'VE SEEN HER SHE MAY EVEN HAVE A MAID IF SHE LIKES BUT OF COURSE SHE HAS NO OCCASION TO DRESS SHE WEARS A LITTLE BLACK FROCK
USHERING IN ANOTHER PERSON ISABEL GOT UP EXPECTING TO SEE ONE OF THE LADIES OF THE SISTERHOOD BUT TO HER EXTREME SURPRISE FOUND HERSELF CONFRONTED WITH MADAME MERLE THE EFFECT WAS STRANGE
SHE MADE HER REFLEXIONS ISABEL WAS SURE AND SHE MUST HAVE HAD A CONVICTION THAT THERE WERE HUSBANDS AND WIVES WHO WERE MORE INTIMATE THAN THAT BUT PANSY WAS NOT INDISCREET EVEN IN THOUGHT
IT'S AS IF I HAD ANTICIPATED YOU I CONFESS I'VE BEEN RATHER INDISCREET I OUGHT TO HAVE ASKED YOUR PERMISSION THERE WAS NONE OF THE OBLIQUE MOVEMENT OF IRONY IN THIS IT WAS SAID SIMPLY AND MILDLY
AN APPLIED HANDLED HUNG UP TOOL AS SENSELESS AND CONVENIENT
AND IN SPITE OF MADAME MERLE'S DECLARATION SHE ANSWERED AFTER A MOMENT MADAME CATHERINE SAYS IT'S ENOUGH YES IT ALSO SEEMS TO ME ENOUGH I WANTED TO ASK YOU ANOTHER WORD ABOUT POOR MISTER TOUCHETT
THE LITTLE PRINCE WENT IN WITH HIS NURSE TO SEE THEM AND TO PUT HIS GIFT WHICH WAS A JEWEL AMONG THEM SHE WANTED A JAR OF ROSEMARY HE SAID AS HE LOOKED AT THE GLITTERING HEAP
HE BROUGHT HIS FATHER OVER TO IT AH MY DEAR THE SUM WAS LARGE ISABEL STOOD STARING
SHE PRETENDED NOT EVEN TO SMILE AND THOUGH ISABEL SAW THAT SHE WAS MORE THAN EVER PLAYING A PART IT SEEMED TO HER THAT ON THE WHOLE THE WONDERFUL WOMAN HAD NEVER BEEN SO NATURAL SHE LOOKED AT HER YOUNG FRIEND FROM HEAD TO FOOT
THE GOOD WOMAN WHAT'S HER NAME MADAME CATHERINE MADE NO OBJECTION WHATEVER I STAYED TWENTY MINUTES WITH PANSY SHE HAS A CHARMING LITTLE ROOM NOT IN THE LEAST CONVENTUAL WITH A PIANO AND FLOWERS SHE HAS ARRANGED IT DELIGHTFULLY
AND SHE SAW THAT THE LARGE ROOMS WERE CLEAN AND CHEERFUL AND THAT THE WELL USED GARDEN HAD SUN FOR WINTER AND SHADE FOR SPRING BUT SHE DISLIKED THE PLACE WHICH AFFRONTED AND ALMOST FRIGHTENED HER
THE ONE I SHOULD HAVE LIKED BEST TO LIVE IN I DON'T VENTURE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE MADAME MERLE ADDED BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE MY LOVE TO THE PLACE ISABEL TURNED AWAY I HAD BETTER GO TO PANSY
SAID THE PRINCE'S NURSE SO THE ROYAL CARRIAGE DRAWN BY SIX WHITE HORSES WAS BROUGHT AND THE LITTLE PRINCE AND HIS SERVANTS RODE AWAY TO THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE AND WHEN THEY GOT THERE THE FIRST THING THEY SPIED
OF HELPLESSNESS THEN ISABEL TURNED SLOW EYES LOOKING DOWN AT HER MADAME MERLE WAS VERY PALE HER OWN EYES COVERED ISABEL'S FACE
THERE WERE CARNATION PINKS IN THE KING'S GREENHOUSES AND ROSES WITH GOLDEN HEARTS AND LOVELY LILIES BUT THERE WAS NO ROSEMARY ROSEMARY WAS A COMMON HERB AND GREW MOSTLY IN COUNTRY GARDENS
AND AFTERWARDS PANSY WALKED ALONG THE CORRIDOR WITH HER VISITOR TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE MADAME MERLE HAS BEEN HERE
HE SAID TO THE NURSE I WISH IT WERE SPRING IT IS EASY TO GET ROSEMARY THEN IS IT NOT
AND IN THE SPACE OF ANOTHER INSTANT SHE HAD GUESSED THE REASON WHY THE PERSON WHO STOOD THERE WAS NOT THE SAME ONE SHE HAD SEEN HITHERTO BUT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON A PERSON WHO KNEW HER SECRET
ABOUT MY STEP DAUGHTER OH IT WOULD TAKE LONG TO TELL YOU WE THINK IT'S ENOUGH MADAME CATHERINE DISTINCTLY OBSERVED AND SHE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR OF THE PARLOUR
BUT NOT HARSHLY NOR DEFIANTLY WITH A COLD GENTLENESS RATHER AND AN ABSENCE OF ANY AIR OF ALLUSION TO THEIR LAST MEETING IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD WISHED TO MARK A DISTINCTION SHE HAD BEEN IRRITATED THEN
THAT'S WHAT I SAY TO MYSELF WHAT DOES IT MATTER BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO COME OUT I WISH INDEED YOU MIGHT DON'T LEAVE ME HERE PANSY WENT ON GENTLY
HE MADE ME MADAME MERLE APPEARING TO SEE HERSELF SUCCESSFUL SHE WENT ON MORE TRIUMPHANTLY HE IMPARTED TO YOU THAT EXTRA LUSTRE WHICH WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE YOU A BRILLIANT MATCH
SHE WAS IN FULL POSSESSION OF HER RESOURCES I FOUND I WISHED TO WAIT FOR YOU SHE SAID URBANELY BUT IT'S NOT TO TALK ABOUT PANSY ISABEL WONDERED WHAT IT COULD BE TO TALK ABOUT
MADAME MERLE RECOVERED HERSELF SHE HAD A CHANCE TO EXPRESS SYMPATHY DO YOU GO ALONE YES WITHOUT MY HUSBAND
AND HAD LET HER EYES WANDER AS FAR AS THE LIMITS OF THE ROOM WOULD ALLOW SHE WISHED NEVER TO LOOK AT MADAME MERLE AGAIN YOU'RE SURPRISED TO FIND ME HERE AND I'M AFRAID YOU'RE NOT PLEASED THIS LADY WENT ON
JUST AS I WAS LEAVING MADAME CATHERINE THE PORTRESS CAME TO SAY TO HER THAT THERE WAS A LADY FOR THE SIGNORINA OF COURSE I KNEW IT MUST BE YOU AND I ASKED HER TO LET ME GO AND RECEIVE YOU IN HER PLACE SHE DEMURRED GREATLY
AND IRON ALL THE BITTERNESS OF THIS KNOWLEDGE SURGED INTO HER SOUL AGAIN IT WAS AS IF SHE FELT ON HER LIPS THE TASTE OF DISHONOUR THERE WAS A MOMENT DURING WHICH
SHE EXCLAIMED WITH ALL HER CUSTOMARY EAGERNESS TO ACCOMMODATE WE THINK OF YOU ALWAYS YOU'RE A PRECIOUS CHARGE MADAME CATHERINE REMARKED IN THE TONE OF A WOMAN WITH WHOM BENEVOLENCE WAS A HABIT AND WHOSE CONCEPTION OF DUTY
IT FELL WITH A LEADEN WEIGHT ON ISABEL'S EARS IT SEEMED TO REPRESENT THE SURRENDER OF A PERSONALITY THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH WHEN MADAME CATHERINE HAD LEFT THEM TOGETHER PANSY KNEELED DOWN
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SHE JUST HUNG FIRE IT'S RATHER HARD TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING HAS OCCURRED TO ME WHICH MAY NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO YOU AND I GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF MY IDEA
SHE CALLED OUT IN A VOICE THAT ISABEL REMEMBERED AFTERWARDS YES I'LL COME BACK MADAME CATHERINE MET MISSUS OSMOND BELOW AND CONDUCTED HER TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOUR OUTSIDE OF WHICH THE TWO STOOD TALKING A MINUTE
ISABEL HAD OFTEN WONDERED WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THE APPARENT RELATIONS OF HER FATHER WITH HIS WIFE BUT NEVER BY A GLANCE BY AN INTIMATION HAD SHE LET IT BE SEEN THAT SHE DEEMED THEM DEFICIENT IN AN AIR OF INTIMACY
IT WILL BE GOOD FOR HER TO SEE YOU I'LL TAKE YOU TO HER MYSELF THEN SHE DIRECTED HER PLEASED GUARDED VISION TO MADAME MERLE WILL YOU LET ME REMAIN A LITTLE THIS LADY ASKED IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE
HAD KEPT HIS ENAMELS ISABEL LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND SAW THERE MAINLY A PRAYER TO BE TREATED EASILY SHE LAID HER HAND ON PANSY'S AS IF TO LET HER KNOW
IF SHE HAD TURNED AND SPOKEN SHE WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING THAT WOULD HISS LIKE A LASH BUT SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND THEN THE HIDEOUS VISION DROPPED
BUT MY BALL IS THE MOST WONDERFUL BALL THAT WAS EVER MADE CRIED THE LITTLE PRINCE AND IT IS MY FAVORITE PLAYTHING I WOULD NOT GIVE IT AWAY FOR ANYTHING
WHEN THE AUTUMN CAME SHE GREW BETTER EVERY DAY BROUGHT COLOR TO HER CHEEKS AND STRENGTH TO HER LIMBS AND BY AND BY THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS ALLOWED TO GO INTO HER ROOM AND STAND BESIDE HER BED TO TALK TO HER
THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT OVERWHELMED HER SHE BOWED HER PRETTY HEAD TO AUTHORITY AND ONLY ASKED OF AUTHORITY TO BE MERCIFUL YES
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A STRANGE QUESTION SAID MADAME MERLE ARE YOU VERY FOND OF YOUR COUSIN AND SHE GAVE A SMILE AS STRANGE AS HER UTTERANCE YES I'M VERY FOND OF HIM
NO IT'S MY OWN PROPOSAL I THINK I HAD BETTER WAIT THEN DID PAPA SEND ME NO MESSAGE I DON'T THINK HE KNEW I WAS COMING
THE JAR OF ROSEMARY THERE WAS ONCE A LITTLE PRINCE WHOSE MOTHER THE QUEEN WAS SICK ALL SUMMER SHE LAY IN BED AND EVERYTHING WAS KEPT QUIET IN THE PALACE BUT
ISABEL SAID AH YES YOU TOLD ME HE WOULD DIE OF COURSE YOU MUST GO AND WILL PAPA GO NO I SHALL GO ALONE FOR A MOMENT THE GIRL SAID NOTHING
YOU'LL BE VERY FAR AWAY SHE PRESENTLY WENT ON YES I SHALL BE FAR AWAY BUT IT WILL SCARCELY MATTER ISABEL EXPLAINED SINCE SO LONG AS YOU'RE HERE I CAN'T BE CALLED NEAR YOU
ISABEL GOT UP HER TIME WAS RAPIDLY SHORTENING GOOD BYE THEN I LEAVE ROME TO NIGHT PANSY TOOK HOLD OF HER DRESS THERE WAS A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE CHILD'S FACE YOU LOOK STRANGE YOU FRIGHTEN ME
WITH SOMETHING THAT LOOKED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE SHE SPEAKS DELIGHTFULLY OF PANSY SAYS IT'S A GREAT HAPPINESS FOR THEM TO HAVE HER SHE'S A LITTLE SAINT OF HEAVEN AND A MODEL TO THE OLDEST OF THEM
ISABEL HAD BEEN THINKING ALL DAY OF HER FALSITY HER AUDACITY HER ABILITY HER PROBABLE SUFFERING AND THESE DARK THINGS SEEMED TO FLASH WITH A SUDDEN LIGHT AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
BUT WONDER WITH PANSY HAD NEVER BEEN A REASON FOR NON COMPLIANCE I NEVER WILL AGAIN SHE SAID WITH EXQUISITE GENTLENESS AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE THEY HAD TO SEPARATE AS IT APPEARED TO BE PART OF THE MILD
ELLE ECLAIRE LA MAISON SAID THE GOOD SISTER PANSY WORE AS MADAME MERLE HAD SAID A LITTLE BLACK DRESS IT WAS PERHAPS THIS THAT MADE HER LOOK PALE THEY'RE VERY GOOD TO ME THEY THINK OF EVERYTHING
YES BUT YOU CAN COME AND SEE ME THOUGH YOU'VE NOT COME VERY OFTEN I'VE NOT COME BECAUSE YOUR FATHER FORBADE IT TO DAY I BRING NOTHING WITH ME I CAN'T AMUSE YOU I'M NOT TO BE AMUSED
A LOVELY GREEN PLANT GROWING IN A JAR RIGHT IN THE VERY CITY WHERE THE PRINCE HIMSELF LIVED
THEN AS SHE HEARD HER OWN WORDS A DEEP PURE BLUSH CAME INTO HER FACE ISABEL READ THE MEANING OF IT SHE SAW THE POOR GIRL HAD BEEN VANQUISHED
SO A PURSE FILLED SO FULL OF GOLD THAT IT COULD NOT HOLD ANOTHER PIECE WAS TAKEN TO THE OLD WOMAN BUT PRESENTLY IT WAS BROUGHT BACK SHE WOULD NOT SELL HER ROSEMARY NO NOT EVEN FOR A PURSE OF GOLD
HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HER IN A NEW AND VIOLENT LIGHT BUT THE SECONDARY EFFECT OF THE REVELATION WAS TO MAKE HER REACH OUT A HAND
BUT ISABEL FAR AFLOAT ON A SEA OF WONDER AND PAIN COULD NOT HAVE TOLD HERSELF WITH WHAT INTENTION IT WAS UTTERED BUT I'VE NOT BEEN SITTING LONG MADAME MERLE CONTINUED THAT IS I'VE NOT BEEN LONG WITH PANSY
TURN THEIR PAINTED HEADS AND SHAKE THEM AT EACH OTHER BUT AS IN THIS LATTER CASE SHE WOULD FOR VERY SOLEMNITY'S SAKE NEVER HAVE MENTIONED THE AWFUL PHENOMENON SO SHE PUT AWAY ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SECRETS OF LARGER LIVES THAN HER OWN
SAID THE QUEEN A SMILE AND A KISS AND A HUG AROUND THE NECK THESE ARE THE DEAREST GIFTS I KNOW BUT THE PRINCE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ANSWER
AND TO WHICH THE VERY FRAILTY OF THE VESSEL IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN OFFERED HER ONLY GAVE AN INTRINSIC PRICE
SHE WOULD AS LITTLE HAVE VENTURED TO JUDGE HER GENTLE STEPMOTHER AS TO CRITICISE HER MAGNIFICENT FATHER HER HEART MAY HAVE STOOD ALMOST AS STILL AS IT WOULD HAVE DONE
SHE STOOD THERE IN A KIND OF PROUD PENANCE YOU'RE VERY UNHAPPY I KNOW BUT I'M MORE SO YES
IT WAS WOVEN OF MAGIC STUFF AS BRIGHT AS THE SUNLIGHT AS SPARKLING AS THE STARLIGHT AND AS GOLDEN AS THE MOON AT HARVEST TIME AND WHEN THE LITTLE PRINCE THREW IT INTO THE AIR OR BOUNCED IT ON THE FLOOR
WAS THE LITTLE GREEN PLANT IN A JAR STANDING IN THE OLD WOMAN'S WINDOW THE OLD WOMAN HERSELF CAME TO THE DOOR AND SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE THE LITTLE PRINCE SHE INVITED HIM IN AND BADE HIM WARM HIS HANDS BY THE FIRE
ISABEL SAID NOTHING FOR A MINUTE HER HEART BEAT FAST WILL YOU COME AWAY WITH ME NOW SHE ASKED PANSY LOOKED AT HER PLEADINGLY DID PAPA TELL YOU TO BRING ME
THAT'S NOT WHAT PAPA WISHES THEN IT HARDLY MATTERS WHETHER I'M IN ROME OR IN ENGLAND YOU'RE NOT HAPPY MISSUS OSMOND SAID PANSY NOT VERY BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
THE QUEEN HAD SO MANY PRESENTS AND VERY FINE THEY WERE TOO THAT THE CHRISTMAS TREE COULD NOT HOLD THEM ALL SO THEY WERE PUT ON A TABLE BEFORE THE THRONE AND WREATHED AROUND WITH HOLLY AND WITH PINE
THAT SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO DEPEND UPON HER HABITUAL RESOURCES FOR HER TOO THE OCCASION WAS EXCEPTIONAL AND SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO TREAT IT BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOMENT THIS GAVE HER A PECULIAR GRAVITY
OR TURNED IT IN HIS HANDS IT RANG LIKE A CHIME OF SILVER BELLS THE SICK CHILD LAUGHED TO HEAR IT AND HELD OUT HIS HANDS FOR IT AND THE PRINCE LET HIM HOLD IT
ONLY IF YOU'RE HERE I SHALL DO IT MORE EASILY ISABEL CONSIDERED I WON'T DESERT YOU SHE SAID AT LAST GOOD BYE MY CHILD THEN THEY HELD EACH OTHER A MOMENT IN A SILENT EMBRACE LIKE TWO SISTERS
THIS DISCOVERY WAS TREMENDOUS AND FROM THE MOMENT SHE MADE IT THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED OF WOMEN FALTERED AND LOST HER COURAGE BUT ONLY FOR THAT MOMENT THEN
ISABEL RECOGNISED MADAME CATHERINE WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY MADE AND BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD IMMEDIATELY LET HER SEE MISS OSMOND MADAME CATHERINE LOOKED DOUBLY DISCREET BUT SMILED VERY BLANDLY AND SAID
WITH YOUR ROSEMARY ROSEMARY ROSEMARY
THE QUEEN'S PHYSICIAN HAD SAID THAT SHE MIGHT SIT UP TO SEE THE CHRISTMAS TREE THAT NIGHT AND HAVE HER PRESENTS WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY AND EVERY ONE WAS RUNNING TO AND FRO TO GET THINGS IN READINESS FOR HER
THE CONSCIOUS STREAM OF HER PERFECT MANNER GATHERED ITSELF AGAIN AND FLOWED ON AS SMOOTHLY AS MIGHT BE TO THE END BUT IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE SHE HAD THE END IN VIEW THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO PROCEED
BUT VERY DEFINITE DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH PANSY LIVED THAT SHE SHOULD NOT GO DOWN ISABEL DESCENDED AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE BOTTOM THE GIRL WAS STANDING ABOVE YOU'LL COME BACK
SO MADAME MERLE WENT ON WITH MUCH OF THE BRILLIANCY OF A WOMAN WHO HAD LONG BEEN A MISTRESS OF THE ART OF CONVERSATION BUT THERE WERE PHASES AND GRADATIONS IN HER SPEECH NOT ONE OF WHICH WAS LOST UPON ISABEL'S EAR
TO LEAVE MADAME MERLE IN THIS UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION SHE LEFT HER THERE FOR A PERIOD THAT MUST HAVE SEEMED LONG TO THIS LADY WHO AT LAST SEATED HERSELF WITH A MOVEMENT WHICH WAS IN ITSELF A CONFESSION
AT BOTTOM IT'S HIM YOU'VE TO THANK SHE STOPPED THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ISABEL'S EYES I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU IT WAS MY UNCLE'S MONEY YES IT WAS YOUR UNCLE'S MONEY
HE SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE PALACE AND HASTENED TOWARD THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE HE HAD NEVER BEEN OUT AT NIGHT BY HIMSELF BEFORE AND HE MIGHT HAVE FELT A LITTLE AFRAID
WHY HAVE YOU NOT BROUGHT IT WITH YOU GO AND GET IT AT ONCE WELL AS FOR THAT
SHE HAD A MANNER WHICH CARRIED OFF NOT ONLY HER OWN DEFICIENCIES BUT THOSE OF OTHER PEOPLE BUT SHE WAS DIFFERENT FROM USUAL SHE CAME IN SLOWLY BEHIND THE PORTRESS AND ISABEL INSTANTLY PERCEIVED
SO THOUGHT ISABEL ARE THE GREAT PENAL ESTABLISHMENTS MADAME CATHERINE GENTLY PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR OF PANSY'S ROOM AND USHERED IN THE VISITOR THEN STOOD SMILING WITH FOLDED HANDS
AND SO THE OLD WOMAN HAD TO GO HOME WITH HER JAR OF ROSEMARY UNDER HER SHAWL THE NEXT DAY WAS THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND THERE WAS A GREAT STIR AND BUSTLE IN THE PALACE
MY DEAR CHILD WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU SHE ASKED I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M HAPPIER WHEN I THINK OF YOU YOU CAN ALWAYS THINK OF ME NOT WHEN YOU'RE SO FAR I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
I BELIEVE A LITTLE JAR OF ROSEMARY LIKE THAT WHICH BLOOMED IN MY MOTHER'S WINDOW WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THIS
THE OLD WOMAN MADE HASTE TO ANSWER THE KNOCK AND WHEN SHE SAW THE PRINCE SHE WAS TOO ASTONISHED TO SPEAK HERE IS THE BALL HE CRIED PUTTING IT INTO HER HANDS PLEASE GIVE ME THE ROSEMARY FOR MY MOTHER
SEEMED ONLY HER TRIBUTE TO THE TRUTH OF THINGS SHE DIDN'T PRESUME TO JUDGE OTHERS BUT SHE HAD JUDGED HERSELF SHE HAD SEEN THE REALITY SHE HAD NO VOCATION FOR STRUGGLING WITH COMBINATIONS
AT ANY RATE IT'S A LITTLE DISMAL THEREFORE I CAME ON THE CHANCE I KNEW OF COURSE THAT YOU'D COME AND HER FATHER AS WELL STILL I HAD NOT BEEN TOLD OTHER VISITORS WERE FORBIDDEN
OF HANDWRITINGS OF PROFANED RELICS OF GRIM THINGS PRODUCED IN COURT IT MADE ISABEL FEEL FAINT IF IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY TO SPEAK ON THE SPOT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE UNABLE
THIS SUBTLE MODULATION MARKED A MOMENTOUS DISCOVERY THE PERCEPTION OF AN ENTIRELY NEW ATTITUDE ON THE PART OF HER LISTENER MADAME MERLE HAD GUESSED IN THE SPACE OF AN INSTANT
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE FRIENDLY STARS THAT TWINKLED IN THE SKY ABOVE HIM WE WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY THEY SEEMED TO SAY AND HE TRUDGED ON BRAVELY IN THEIR LIGHT
AND AS SOON AS HE HAD GONE OUT OF THE QUEEN'S ROOM HE SENT A SERVANT TO HIS FATHER'S GREENHOUSES TO INQUIRE FOR A ROSEMARY PLANT BUT THE SERVANT CAME BACK WITH DISAPPOINTING NEWS
SHE WILL NEVER THINK OF IT AGAIN WHEN SHE SEES THESE THINGS YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT SAID THE NURSE BUT THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS NOT SURE HE THOUGHT OF IT HIMSELF MANY TIMES THAT DAY AND ONCE WHEN HE WAS PLAYING WITH HIS BALL
AND WAS ADMITTED BY THE PORTRESS OF THE CONVENT A GENIAL AND OBSEQUIOUS PERSON ISABEL HAD BEEN AT THIS INSTITUTION BEFORE SHE HAD COME WITH PANSY TO SEE THE SISTERS SHE KNEW THEY WERE GOOD WOMEN
THERE IS A LITTLE DIFFICULTY THE OLD WOMAN TO WHOM THE ROSEMARY BELONGS DID NOT WANT TO SELL IT EVEN THOUGH I OFFERED HER A HANDFUL OF SILVER FOR IT THEN GIVE HER A PURSE OF GOLD SAID THE LITTLE PRINCE
MADAME MERLE ADDED HAVE YOU REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S REALLY AT HIS LAST I'VE NO INFORMATION BUT A TELEGRAM UNFORTUNATELY IT ONLY CONFIRMS A PROBABILITY
I CAME TO SEE HER BECAUSE IT OCCURRED TO ME THIS AFTERNOON THAT SHE MUST BE RATHER LONELY AND PERHAPS EVEN A LITTLE MISERABLE
BUT SHE WOULD ANSWER NOTHING TILL THEY HAD TAKEN HER TO THE LITTLE PRINCE SILVER AND GOLD WOULD NOT BUY THE ROSEMARY SHE SAID WHEN SHE SAW HIM
THE LITTLE BOY WAS NOT SATISFIED THOUGH
BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT SHE SAW SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE BUDDING PLANTS AND THE GLOWING AFTERNOON SHE SAW IN THE CRUDE LIGHT OF THAT REVELATION WHICH HAD ALREADY BECOME A PART OF EXPERIENCE
WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH THEN SHE SAID IT WAS HER ONLY REVENGE I BELIEVED IT WAS YOU I HAD TO THANK MADAME MERLE DROPPED HER EYES
WHAT HAVE YOU THOUGHT WELL THAT I MUST NEVER DISPLEASE PAPA YOU KNEW THAT BEFORE YES BUT I KNOW IT BETTER I'LL DO ANYTHING I'LL DO ANYTHING SAID PANSY
A LARGE CLEAN STOVE OF WHITE PORCELAIN UNLIGHTED A COLLECTION OF WAX FLOWERS UNDER GLASS AND A SERIES OF ENGRAVINGS FROM RELIGIOUS PICTURES ON THE WALLS
AND TOOK OUT HIS FAVORITE PLAYTHING WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED IN HIS POCKET AND SHOWED IT TO HIM THE PRINCE'S FAVORITE PLAYTHING WAS A BALL WHICH WAS LIKE NO OTHER BALL THAT HAD EVER BEEN MADE
MADAME MERLE WAS SITTING JUST AS ISABEL HAD LEFT HER LIKE A WOMAN SO ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
TO ENGLAND NOT TO COME BACK I DON'T KNOW WHEN I SHALL COME BACK AH
YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT BUT THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS NOT SURE AND WHEN THE NURSE HAD GONE TO HER SUPPER AND HE WAS LEFT BY CHANCE FOR A MOMENT ALONE HE PUT ON HIS COAT OF FUR AND TAKING THE BALL WITH HIM
BUT EACH ONE CAME BACK WITH THE SAME STORY TO TELL THERE WAS ROSEMARY ENOUGH AND TO SPARE IN THE SPRING BUT THE FROST HAD BEEN IN THE COUNTRY
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SAY SUCH THINGS I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW I KNOW NOTHING BUT WHAT I'VE GUESSED BUT I'VE GUESSED THAT ISABEL WENT TO THE DOOR AND WHEN SHE HAD OPENED IT STOOD A MOMENT
AND GAVE HIM A COOKY FROM HER CUPBOARD TO EAT SHE HAD A LITTLE GRANDSON NO OLDER THAN THE PRINCE BUT HE WAS SICK AND COULD NOT RUN ABOUT AND PLAY LIKE OTHER CHILDREN HE LAY IN A LITTLE WHITE BED IN THE OLD WOMAN'S ROOM
ON THE OTHER OCCASION ISABEL HAD THOUGHT IT LESS LIKE ROME THAN LIKE PHILADELPHIA BUT TO DAY SHE MADE NO REFLEXIONS THE APARTMENT ONLY SEEMED TO HER VERY EMPTY AND VERY SOUNDLESS
I MUST TELL YOU THAT AND SAID IT WAS HER DUTY TO NOTIFY THE MOTHER SUPERIOR IT WAS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE THAT YOU SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT I REQUESTED HER TO LET THE MOTHER SUPERIOR ALONE
HE SAID TO THE NURSE IF I HAD A ROSEMARY PLANT I'D BE WILLING TO SELL IT FOR A PURSE FULL OF GOLD WOULDN'T YOU INDEED YES SAID THE NURSE AND SO WOULD ANY ONE ELSE IN HIS RIGHT SENSES YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT
A SORT OF RECOGNITION OF THE GENERAL SADNESS OF THINGS MISTER TOUCHETT NEVER LIKED ME BUT I'M SORRY HE'S DYING SHALL YOU SEE HIS MOTHER YES SHE HAS RETURNED FROM AMERICA
I WON'T GO IN SAID THE GOOD SISTER MADAME MERLE'S WAITING FOR YOU AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ISABEL STIFFENED SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING IF THERE WERE NO OTHER EGRESS FROM THE CONVENT
AFTER THIS SHE THOUGHT EXCEPT OF HER JOURNEY ONLY OF ONE THING SHE MUST GO AND SEE PANSY FROM HER SHE COULDN'T TURN AWAY
MADAME MERLE RAISED HER EYES I SHALL GO TO AMERICA
SHE USED TO BE VERY KIND TO ME BUT SHE HAS CHANGED OTHERS TOO HAVE CHANGED
SHE HAD NOT SEEN HER YET AS OSMOND HAD GIVEN HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS TOO SOON TO BEGIN SHE DROVE AT FIVE O'CLOCK TO A HIGH FLOOR IN A NARROW STREET
AND THE GOOD SISTER GAVE A KNOWING LAUGH SHE LED ISABEL OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH SEVERAL CORRIDORS AND UP A LONG STAIRCASE ALL THESE DEPARTMENTS WERE SOLID AND BARE LIGHT AND CLEAN
SHE SEEMED READY TO RETIRE HOW DOES THIS DEAR CHILD LOOK SHE ASKED OF ISABEL LINGERING A MOMENT SHE LOOKS PALE ISABEL ANSWERED THAT'S THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU SHE'S VERY HAPPY
THE PORTRESS LEFT HER TO WAIT IN THE PARLOUR OF THE CONVENT WHILE SHE WENT TO MAKE IT KNOWN THAT THERE WAS A VISITOR FOR THE DEAR YOUNG LADY THE PARLOUR WAS A VAST COLD APARTMENT WITH NEW LOOKING FURNITURE
WHILE THE TWO OTHERS MET AND EMBRACED SHE'S GLAD TO SEE YOU SHE REPEATED IT WILL DO HER GOOD AND SHE PLACED THE BEST CHAIR CAREFULLY FOR ISABEL BUT SHE MADE NO MOVEMENT TO SEAT HERSELF
IT'S VERY PRETTY YOU'RE VERY COMFORTABLE ISABEL SCARCELY KNEW WHAT SHE COULD SAY TO HER ON THE ONE HAND SHE COULDN'T LET HER THINK SHE HAD COME TO PITY HER AND ON THE OTHER IT WOULD BE A DULL MOCKERY TO PRETEND TO REJOICE WITH HER
SAID PANSY WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF OF PAPA A LITTLE AND OF MADAME MERLE SHE HAS JUST BEEN TO SEE ME YOU MUST NOT SAY THAT ISABEL OBSERVED OH I'LL DO EVERYTHING THEY WANT
AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT WHEN THE QUEEN SAT DOWN BEFORE HER GREAT TABLE OF GIFTS THE FIRST THING SHE SPIED WAS A JAR OF SWEET ROSEMARY LIKE THAT WHICH HAD BLOOMED IN HER MOTHER'S WINDOW WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL
SHE SAID AND SHE TOOK THE LITTLE PRINCE IN HER ARMS
AND THERE WAS NOT A GREEN SPRIG LEFT TO BRING TO THE LITTLE PRINCE FOR HIS MOTHER'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS HOWEVER NEWS WAS BROUGHT THAT ROSEMARY HAD BEEN FOUND
SHE LOOKS SO CHARMING I WENT AFTERWARDS TO SEE MOTHER CATHERINE WHO HAS A VERY GOOD ROOM TOO I ASSURE YOU I DON'T FIND THE POOR SISTERS AT ALL MONASTIC MOTHER CATHERINE HAS A MOST COQUETTISH LITTLE TOILET TABLE
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT THEN ADDED AND YOU'LL SEE DEAR OLD GARDENCOURT AGAIN
HE THINKS I'VE NOT HAD ENOUGH SAID PANSY BUT I HAVE THE LADIES ARE VERY KIND TO ME AND THE LITTLE GIRLS COME TO SEE ME THERE ARE SOME VERY LITTLE ONES SUCH CHARMING CHILDREN THEN MY ROOM
YOUR COUSIN DID YOU ONCE A GREAT SERVICE HAVE YOU NEVER GUESSED IT HE HAS DONE ME MANY SERVICES YES BUT ONE WAS MUCH ABOVE THE REST HE MADE YOU A RICH WOMAN
THOUGH HER EYES WERE ABSENT FROM HER COMPANION'S FACE SHE HAD NOT PROCEEDED FAR BEFORE ISABEL NOTED A SUDDEN BREAK IN HER VOICE A LAPSE IN HER CONTINUITY WHICH WAS IN ITSELF A COMPLETE DRAMA
AND AS ISABEL ANSWERED NOTHING SHE ADDED ABRUPTLY I DON'T LIKE MADAME MERLE ISABEL HESITATED THEN STOPPED YOU MUST NEVER SAY THAT THAT YOU DON'T LIKE MADAME MERLE PANSY LOOKED AT HER IN WONDER
I'VE NOT MUCH TIME WHILE SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER FOR THE PROPER EGRESS THE DOOR OPENED AND ADMITTED ONE OF THE LADIES OF THE HOUSE WHO ADVANCED WITH A DISCREET SMILE GENTLY RUBBING UNDER HER LONG LOOSE SLEEVES A PAIR OF PLUMP WHITE HANDS
NOT FOR THE WORLD WOULD SHE HAVE SPENT A NIGHT THERE IT PRODUCED TO DAY MORE THAN BEFORE THE IMPRESSION OF A WELL APPOINTED PRISON FOR IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO PRETEND PANSY WAS FREE TO LEAVE IT THIS INNOCENT CREATURE
HE WAS VERY GLAD OF THIS FOR HE WANTED TO ASK HER WHAT SHE WOULD LIKE FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND AS SOON AS HE HAD KISSED HER AND LAID HIS CHEEK AGAINST HERS HE WHISPERED HIS QUESTION IN HER EAR
WHAT REMAINED WAS THE CLEVEREST WOMAN IN THE WORLD STANDING THERE WITHIN A FEW FEET OF HER AND KNOWING AS LITTLE WHAT TO THINK AS THE MEANEST ISABEL'S ONLY REVENGE WAS TO BE SILENT STILL
BUT NO SUCH NECESSITY WAS DISTINCT TO HER IT SEEMED TO HER INDEED THAT SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAY TO MADAME MERLE IN ONE'S RELATIONS WITH THIS LADY HOWEVER THERE WERE NEVER ANY ABSOLUTE NECESSITIES
ISABEL ANSWERED NATURALLY IN YOUR GRIEF BUT IT'S ON THE WHOLE
IT WAS A TIME TO LIVE IN AND THE TWO WERE MERRY ON THEIR JOURNEY IN THE GLITTERING MORNING THE YOUNG MEN IDLED ON THEIR WAY AND WASTED AN HOUR OR TWO IN VAIN ATTEMPTS TO APPROACH A FEEDING DEER NEARLY ENOUGH FOR EFFECTIVE SPEAR THROWING
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE IN SIGHT PERCHED COMFORTABLY UPON A ROCK THE SIDES OF WHICH WERE SO PRECIPITOUS THAT THEY AFFORDED A FOOTHOLD ONLY FOR HUMAN BEINGS WAS A YOUNG WOMAN OF THE SHELL PEOPLE WHO HAD BEFORE ATTRACTED AB'S ATTENTION
WHAT SHE WOULD TELL THEM HE DID NOT KNOW THAT WAS NOT A MATTER TO BE MUCH CONSIDERED THERE WAS BUT ONE THING TO BE DONE
WAS ALMOST AS EQUABLE THEN AS NOW BUT WITH A CERTAIN CRISPNESS WHICH WAS A HERITAGE FROM THE GLACIAL EPOCH
AND THOUGH THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A TEST WAS CONFIDENT THAT AMONG ALL THE SHELL PEOPLE
TEMPERATE WITH A WONDERFUL KEENNESS TO IT
BUT WERE RATHER PROUD OF THE ATTENDANCE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE HILLSIDE ARISTOCRACY THE MORNING WAS ONE TO MAKE MEN FAR OLDER THAN THESE TWO
AB SWAM NOW WITH A SOMEWHAT TIRED AND LANGUID STROKE TO THE SHORE WHERE OAK AWAITED HIM HILARIOUSLY THEY ALMOST CAME TO BLOWS THAT AFTERNOON AND BLOWS BETWEEN SUCH AS THEY MIGHT HAVE EASILY MEANT SUDDEN DEATH
AB LIFTED HIMSELF IN THE WATERS AND GAZED UPON THE DARK SPOT FAR AWAY AND PIQUED AND MADDENED PUT FORTH
IN A FIERCER STROKE AND CAME SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD DISCERN HER OUTLINE THROUGH THE WATER
WHAT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A DOT UPON THE SURFACE FAR AHEAD
BUT THEY MADE BRIEF STAY IN A LOCALITY WHERE THE FOOD AND ODORS WERE NOT QUITE TO THEIR ACCUSTOMED TASTE
AND DRAW HER TO THE BANK AND THEN THERE WOULD BE AN INTERVIEW OF MUCH ENJOYMENT AT LEAST TO HIM HIS STRONG ARM SWEPT THE WATER BACK AND HIS STRONG LEGS WORKING WITH THEM
IT WAS FUN FOR THE YOUNG MEN WHOSE TALE IS TOLD HERE TO GO WITH THE SHELL PEOPLE AND ASSIST IN SPEARING FISH OR DRAWING THEM FROM THE RIVER'S DEPTHS UPON RUDE HOOKS AND THE SHELL PEOPLE DID NOT OBJECT
APPEAR AFFRIGHTED AND THIS AB WONDERED AT FOR IT WAS SELDOM THAT A GIRL OF THE TIME THUS HUNTED WAS NOT AND WITH REASON TERRIFIED SHE POSSIBLY UNDERSTOOD
THE SUM OF ALL THE DAY WAS THAT THERE HAD BEEN MUCH EXERCISE AND FUN FOR OAK AT LEAST
THREE OR FOUR MILES HAD BEEN PASSED AND A STRAIGHT STRETCH OF THE RIVER HAD BEEN ATTAINED AT THE END OF WHICH
EACH CONSISTED OF FOUR OR FIVE SHORT LOGS OF THE MOST BUOYANT WOOD
THE MAST HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FALL AND THE NUTS LAY THICKLY AMONG THE LEAVES EVERY MORNING AND MORE REGULARLY THAN IT COMES NOW THERE WAS A SPREAD OF GLISTENING HOAR FROST UPON THE LOWLANDS AND THE LITTLE OPEN LANDS IN THE FOREST
IT WAS NOT THAT THE SHELL GIRL WAS OTHER THAN AT HOME ON LAND SHE WAS QUITE AT HOME THERE AND REASONABLY FLEET BUT THE CREEK AND RIVER HAD SO BEEN HER ELEMENT FROM BABYHOOD THAT THE CHASE OF THE HILL MAN HAD BEEN
AB HAD LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN OAK
BUT THIS WAS ONLY A DEMONSTRATION MADE IN SHEER AUDACITY AND BLITHESOME INSOLENCE
WERE NOT HIS ARMS AND LEGS LONGER AND STRONGER THAN THEIRS AND HIS CHEST DEEPER HE FELT THAT HE COULD OUTSWIM EASILY ANY BOLD FISHERMAN AMONG THEM AND AS FOR THIS GIRL HE WOULD OVERTAKE HER VERY QUICKLY
THAT HE WANTED TO KNOW HER BETTER THERE MIGHT HE DIDN'T KNOW
AND PLAIN AND WOODLAND WENT THE CHASE WHILE THE PANTING AND CHEERING OAK STRONG LEGGED AND ENDURING AS HE WAS BARELY KEPT PACE WITH THE TWO HEADS HE COULD SEE BOBBING NOT FAR APART NOW IN THE TOSSING WATERS
AND THE OCCASIONAL UP FLIP OF HER BROWN HEELS AS SHE WENT HIGH IN HER STROKE
FOR SHE AND HER PURSUER HAD OFTEN MET BUT THERE WAS AT LEAST REASON ENOUGH FOR AVOIDING TOO CLOSE CONTACT ON THIS DAY SHE SWAM ON STEADILY AND AS STEADILY AB GAINED UPON HER
AND IN A MOMENT IT WAS CARRIED AROUND THE BEND AND LOST TO SIGHT AB DRIFTED TO THE TURN AND SAW BELOW
DROVE HIS BODY FORWARD SWIFTLY TOWARD THE BROWN OBJECT NOT VERY FAR AHEAD ALONG THE BANK RAN THE LAUGHING AND SHOUTING OAK YARD BY YARD
TO CARRY HER AWAY TO A NEW HOME WITH HIM
IT HAD BEEN LEARNED THAT THE WAVES SOMETIMES ENCOUNTERED
AND PROTECTED FROM WILD BEASTS BY THE USUAL HEAPED ROCKS LEAVING ONLY A NARROW PASSAGE
DOUBTLESS THERE CAME A GREATER VIGOR TO THEM IN THE KEEN AIR OF THE HOAR FROST TIME
HAD HE CAUGHT HER AND TALKED WITH HER UPON THE RIVER BANK
I'LL SWIM TO THE ROCK
THERE CAME AN AUTUMN MORNING WHEN AB AND OAK WHO HAD MET AT DAYBREAK DETERMINED TO VISIT THE SHELL PEOPLE AND GO WITH THEM UPON A FISHING EXPEDITION THE SHELL PEOPLE OFTEN FISHED FROM BOATS AND THE BOATS WERE EXCELLENT
AND THERE LEARNED THAT THE PARTY HAD ALREADY GONE THEY DECIDED THAT THEY MIGHT PERHAPS OVERTAKE THE FISHERMEN AND SO WITH THE HUNTER'S EASY LOPE STARTED BRISKLY DOWN THE RIVER BANK THEY WERE NOT DESTINED TO FISH THAT DAY
AND OAK LAUGHED LOUDLY SHORT TIME ELAPSED BETWEEN DECISION AND ACTION IN THOSE DAYS
HIS THOUGHT WAS ONLY WHAT NOW MADE UP AN OVERMASTERING AIM HE MUST REACH AND SEIZE UPON THE GIRL BEFORE HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER
BUT THEY WERE NOT RIVALS YET AND THERE WAS MUCH TO TALK OF GOOD NATUREDLY AFTER SOME SLIGHT OUTFLAMINGS OF PASSION ON THE PART OF AB
AND SOMETHING OF HIS ADMIRATION SHE WAS FISHING DILIGENTLY SHE HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE FISHING PARTY TO BE TAKEN UP ON THEIR RETURN BECAUSE IN THE RUSH OF WATERS ABOUT THE BASE OF THE ROCK WAS A HAUNT OF A SMALL FISH ESTEEMED PARTICULARLY
HOW COULD A WOMAN OUTSWIM A MAN LIKE HIM IT WAS JUST AT THE TIME WHEN THIS THOUGHT CAME THAT AB SAW THE SHELL GIRL LIFT HER HEAD AND TURN IT TOWARD HIM AND LAUGH LAUGH RECKLESSLY
IT WAS NOT THIS YOUNG WOMAN
BUT THE MAIDEN INTERESTED HIM
ALMOST IN HIS VERY FACE SO CLOSE TOGETHER WERE THEY NOW AND THEN SHE TAUGHT HIM SOMETHING
SHE WAS SWIMMING BREAST FORWARD AS WAS HE FOR THAT WAS HIS ONLY WAY SHE WITH A DOG LIKE PADDLING STROKE AND OFTEN SHE TURNED HER HEAD TO LOOK BACKWARD AT THE MAN SHE DID NOT EVEN YET
EVEN IN THE DAYS OF THE CAVE MEN THE GULF STREAM SWINGING FROM THE EQUATOR IN THE GREAT WARM CURRENT ALREADY FORMED LAVED THE THEN PENINSULA AS IT NOW LAVES THE BRITISH ISLES THE CLIMATE AS HAS BEEN TOLD
IT CAME MOST STRIKINGLY IN SPRING AND AUTUMN
AND UPON EVERY SPOT NOT TREE PROTECTED
SHE WAS LIKE THE BIRDS WHICH SWIM AND DIVE AND DIP AND KNOW OF NOTHING WHICH THEY FEAR IF ONLY THEY ARE IN THE WATER FAR ENOUGH
SARAH PURFOY TO NIGHT THE PRISON MUTINY THE LAST WORD ALMOST SHRIEKED OUT IN THE SUFFERER'S DESPERATE EFFORTS TO ARTICULATE RECALLED THE WANDERING SENSES OF JOHN REX HUSH HE CRIED IS THAT YOU JEMMY
SARAH PURFOY HE REMEMBERED NOW EACH DETAIL OF THE CONVERSATION HE HAD SO STRANGELY OVERHEARD AND HOW IMPERATIVE IT WAS THAT HE SHOULD WITHOUT DELAY REVEAL THE PLOT THAT THREATENED THE SHIP HOW THAT PLOT WAS TO BE CARRIED OUT HE DID NOT PAUSE TO CONSIDER
BUT THEIR LAUGHTER ONLY MADE THE SURROUNDING GLOOM SEEM DEEPER THAN BEFORE SARAH PURFOY CASTING HER EYES TOWARD THE BARRICADE
AT THE SIGHT OF THIS UNEXPECTED ADVERSARY AND TOO CLOSE TO STRIKE HIM LOCKED HIM IN HIS ARMS THE TWO MEN WERE DRAWN TOGETHER THE GUARD ON THE QUARTER DECK DARED NOT FIRE AT THE TWO BODIES THAT TWINED ABOUT EACH OTHER ROLLED ACROSS THE DECK
GAINING THE CLEARED SPACE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER HOLD UP HIS HANDS AS THOUGH TO SHIELD HIMSELF FROM A BLOW
GLIDED THROUGH THE CAREFULLY ADJUSTED DOOR HE HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO GO ON DRINKING CUC COME SARAH HE HICCUPED IT'S ALL VERY FINE MY LASS BUT YOU NEEDN'T BE SO HIC PROUD YOU KNOW I'M A PLAIN SAILOR
THIS SKURRYING NOISE WAS MADE BY THE CONVICTS RUSHING TO THEIR BERTHS TO ESCAPE THE THREATENED SHOWER OF GRAPE TO THE TWENTY DESPERADOES COWERING BEFORE THE MUZZLE OF THE HOWITZER IT SPOKE MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN WORDS THE CHARM WAS BROKEN
EH WATER IS IT THERE STEADY WITH IT NOW AND HE LIFTED A PANNIKIN TO THE BLACKENED FROTH FRINGED LIPS
FELLOW SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF MISTER FRERE I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ME DID I IF YOU DON'T PLEASE ME IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT PERHAPS WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU SOLDIERS HAVE SO MANY THINGS TO THINK OF YOUR GUARDS AND SENTRIES AND VISITS AND THINGS
GO ON OLD MAN CRIES JEMMY VETCH TO THE GIANT RUBBING HIS THIN HANDS WITH ELDRITCH GLEE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT AND THEN HIS QUICK EARS CATCHING THE JINGLE OF ARMS HE SAID STAND BY NOW FOR THE DOOR ONE RUSH'LL DO IT
TO TELL THEM THAT WE HAVE FOUND THEM OUT THIS TIME WON'T PREVENT EM TRYING IT AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR SCHEME IS EITHER
MILES WAS JEALOUS FRERE SMILING WITH DELIGHT AT HER CHANGE OF MANNER CAME CLOSE TO HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR
HE KNEW THAT WITH ALL HIS WIFE'S FOLLY SHE WOULD OBEY UNHESITATINGLY WHEN HE COUCHED AN ORDER IN SUCH TERMS ACCORDING TO THE USUAL CUSTOM ON BOARD CONVICT SHIPS THE GUARDS RELIEVED EACH OTHER EVERY TWO HOURS AND AT SIX P M THE POOP GUARD WAS REMOVED TO THE QUARTER DECK
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT GONE OFF TO PINE'S CABIN THE INTELLIGENCE STRUCK HER WITH DISMAY WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF SUCH AN UNUSUAL PROCEEDING SURELY THEY DID NOT SUSPECT WHAT DO THEY WANT THERE SHE ASKED MAURICE FRERE WAS NOT IN THE HUMOUR TO ARGUE QUESTIONS OF PROBABILITY
WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE THIS THE MEN POURING OUT OF THE DARKNESS INTO THE SUDDEN GLARE OF THE LANTERNS RUSHED BEWILDERED ACROSS THE DECK MILES TRUE TO HIS PROMISE DID NOT FIRE
VICKERS PROMISED AND KEPT HIS PROMISE SO FAR AS TO CHAT CHEERILY WITH BLUNT AND FRERE AT DINNER ONLY WRITING A BRIEF NOTE TO HIS WIFE TO TELL HER THAT WHATEVER SHE HEARD SHE WAS NOT TO STIR FROM HER CABIN UNTIL HE CAME TO HER
JEMMY VETCH FEELING BY THAT CURIOUS SYMPATHY WHICH NERVOUS NATURES POSSESS THAT HIS COMRADES WISHED HIM TO ACT AS SPOKESMAN
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED WHAT WILL BEFALL THOSE HALF DOZEN WOMEN IN THE SOLDIERS BERTHS HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF THE FATE OF YOUR OWN WIFE AND CHILD VICKERS SHUDDERED HAVE IT YOUR WAY MISTER PINE YOU KNOW BEST PERHAPS
AND IN THE CUDDY AT HER RIGHT HAND THE USUAL ROW OF OIL LAMPS BURNED SHE LOOKED MECHANICALLY FOR VICKERS WHO WAS ORDINARILY THERE AT THAT HOUR BUT THE CUDDY WAS EMPTY SO MUCH THE BETTER SHE THOUGHT
TRAINING THE DEADLY MUZZLE TO A LEVEL WITH THE OPENING IN THE BARRICADE STOOD READY TO FIRE SURRENDER CRIED VICKERS
HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS HANGING OVER THE BRINK OF DELIRIUM AND THAT UNLESS HE MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD BEFORE HIS SENSES UTTERLY DESERTED HIM ALL WAS LOST
THE MUTINEERS WERE CAUGHT IN A TRAP THE NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE BARRACKS AND THE BARRICADE WAS CHOKED WITH STRUGGLING FIGURES SOME TWENTY CONVICTS AND HALF AS MANY SOLDIERS STRUCK AND STABBED AT EACH OTHER IN THE CROWD THERE WAS BARELY ELBOW ROOM
APPROACHED TO TAKE THE KISS HE COVETED SHE SEIZED THE MOMENT SURRENDERED HERSELF TO HIS EMBRACE DREW FROM HER POCKET THE LAUDANUM BOTTLE AND PASSING HER HAND OVER HIS
DASHED HIS CLENCHED FIST IN THE SOLDIER'S FACE AND THE MAN MADDENED BY THE BLOW LET GO THE CUTLASS AND DRAWING HIS PISTOL SHOT HIS NEW ASSAILANT THROUGH THE HEAD
AND WITH THE GROG SWAYING FEARFULLY IN ONE HAND MADE AT HER THE SHIP'S BELL STRUCK THE HALF HOUR NOW OR NEVER WAS THE TIME BLUNT CAUGHT HER ROUND THE WAIST WITH ONE ARM AND HICCUPING WITH LOVE AND RUM
WOULD THEY SUCCEED IN OVERCOMING THE GUARDS OR WOULD THEY BE BEATEN BACK THEY WOULD SOON KNOW AND IN THE HOT DUSK STRAINING THEIR EYES TO SEE EACH OTHER THEY WAITED FOR THE ISSUE SUDDENLY THE NOISES CEASED
TO GET HER TO COME WAS THE FIRST OBJECT HOW TO MAKE DUTY FIT WITH PLEASURE WOULD BE CONSIDERED AFTERWARDS BESIDES THE GUARD COULD RELIEVE ITSELF FOR ONCE WITHOUT HIS SUPERVISION VERY WELL AT EIGHT THEN DEAREST
LIKE SOME WOUNDED CREATURE ON THE OPAQUE PROFUNDITY OF THAT STAGNANT OCEAN A HORRIBLE SHADOW HAD FALLEN THE MALABAR SEEMED TO BE ENVELOPED IN AN ELECTRIC CLOUD WHOSE SULLEN GLOOM A CHANCE SPARK MIGHT FLASH INTO A BLAZE THAT SHOULD CONSUME HER
CLOSE AT THE GIANT'S HEELS FLUNG HIMSELF UPON THE NEAREST SOLDIER AND GRASPING HIS WRIST STRUGGLED FOR THE CUTLASS
CLAP ALL THE VILLAINS WE GET IN IRONS
THEY WERE TOGETHER ONCE MORE AND THE CROW HAVING TAKEN OFF HIS PRISON CAP HELD IT AT ARM'S LENGTH WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE WIPED HIS BROW WITH THE OTHER HER SIGNAL HAD BEEN OBSERVED DURING ALL THIS RUFUS DAWES
WE SURRENDER HE SAID IT'S NO USE GETTING OUR BRAINS BLOWN OUT AND RAISING HIS HANDS HE OBEYED THE MOTION OF VICKERS'S FINGERS AND LED THE WAY TOWARDS THE BARRACK BRING THE IRONS FORWARD THERE SHOUTED VICKERS HASTENING FROM HIS PERILOUS POSITION
DIED AWAY FROM HER LIPS LEAVING THEM AN ASHEN GREY COLOUR HER EYES CLOSED IN AGONY LOOSING HER HOLD OF HIM SHE STAGGERED TO HER FEET PRESSED HER HANDS UPON HER BOSOM AND UTTERED A SHARP CRY OF PAIN THE FEVER WHICH HAD BEEN ON HER TWO DAYS
NOW THAT DEATH MENACED THEM THEY LONGED FIERCELY FOR THE CHANCE OF ESCAPE WHICH SEEMED PERMITTED TO FREEMEN LET US GET OUT THEY SAID EACH MAN SPEAKING TO HIS PARTICULAR FRIEND WE ARE LOCKED UP HERE TO DIE LIKE SHEEP
AND BEHIND THE HOWITZER BACKED UP BY AN ARRAY OF BROWN MUSKET BARRELS
I AM ACTING FOR THE BEST UPON MY SOUL I AM YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT CONVICTS ARE OR RATHER
COULD HEAR GASPS AND MOANS AND MUTTERINGS
HE COULD GIVE SUCH INFORMATION AS WOULD AVERT THAT DANGER AND SAVE THE SHIP BUT
AND KEP DANCIN ROUND THE DANDY'S WENCH LIKE A PARCEL O DOGS THE FEVER'S ABOARD AND WE'VE GOT ALL READY WHAT'S THE USE O WAITIN
STEPPED OUT OF THE CABIN AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER THE DUSKY GLOOM WHICH HAD HELD THE DECK ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT ENVELOPED ALL FORWARD OF THE MAIN MAST A LANTERN SWUNG IN THE FORECASTLE AND SWAYED WITH THE MOTION OF THE SHIP
WITH A STRONG EFFORT SHE DISPELLED THE DIZZINESS THAT HAD ALMOST OVERPOWERED HER AND HELD HERSELF ERECT IT WOULD NEVER DO TO BREAK DOWN NOW THE DOOR OPENED AND MAURICE FRERE DREW HER INTO THE CABIN SO YOU HAVE COME SAID HE
POURED HALF ITS CONTENTS INTO THE GLASS THINK I'M HIC DRUNK DO YER NUN NOT I MY WENCH YOU WILL BE IF YOU DRINK MUCH MORE COME FINISH THAT AND BE QUIET OR I'LL GO AWAY BUT SHE THREW A PROVOCATION INTO HER GLANCE AS SHE SPOKE
IF HE HAD NOT A CONSTITUTION LIKE A HORSE I DON'T THINK HE COULD LIVE OUT THE NIGHT THREE EIGHTEEN SEVEN FOUR MUTTERED REX DOT AND CARRY ONE IS THAT AN OCCUPATION FOR A GENTLEMAN NO SIR GOOD NIGHT MY LORD GOOD NIGHT
IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK AND THE RELIEF GUARD WAS COMING FROM THE AFTER DECK THE CROWD OF PRISONERS ROUND THE DOOR HELD THEIR BREATH TO LISTEN IT'S ALL PLANNED SAYS GABBETT IN A LOW GROWL
THE RED LINE OF LIGHT WHICH GLOWED FOR AN INSTANT THROUGH THE DOORWAY WAS BLOTTED OUT BY A MASS OF FIGURES ALL THE PRISON SURGED FORWARD AND BEFORE THE EYE COULD WINK FIVE TEN TWENTY OF THE MOST DESPERATE WERE OUTSIDE
SHE CAST HER EYES DOWN TO THE DECK AND A MODEST FLUSH ROSE IN HER CHEEKS I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO SHE SAID IN A HALF WHISPER THERE ARE SO MANY EYES UPON ME
AND THIS BLIND ABSORBED MUCH OF THE LIGHT HE COULD BUT JUST SEE THE DECK ABOVE HIS HEAD AND DISTINGUISH THE OUTLINES OF THREE OTHER BERTHS APPARENTLY SIMILAR TO HIS OWN THE ONLY SOUNDS THAT BROKE THE SILENCE WERE THE GURGLING OF THE WATER BELOW HIM
MOODILY PATIENT AS IF WAITING FOR SOMETHING THREE MEN TWO PRISONERS AND A SOLDIER HAD SUCCUMBED SINCE RUFUS DAWES HAD BEEN REMOVED TO THE HOSPITAL AND THOUGH AS YET
AND TO ONE GROUP IN PARTICULAR HER GLANCE WAS DIRECTED THREE MEN LEANING CARELESSLY AGAINST THE BULWARKS WATCHED HER EVERY MOTION THERE SHE IS RIGHT ENOUGH GROWLED MISTER GABBETT AS IF IN CONTINUATION OF A PREVIOUS REMARK
WOULD HAVE DETECTED SOME DIFFERENCE BENEATH THIS OUTWARD VARNISH OF SIMILARITY THE MAN AT THE WHEEL LOOKED ROUND THE HORIZON MORE EAGERLY AND SPIT INTO THE SWIRLING UNWHOLESOME LOOKING WATER WITH A MORE DEJECTED AIR THAN BEFORE
AND AS THE CRIES OF THE THREE SENTRIES PASSING THE WORD TO THE QUARTER DECK DIE AWAY GABBETT WHO HAS BEEN LEANING WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOOR NUDGES JEMMY VETCH
OF COURSE I MERELY SUGGESTED AND I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE GIRL EXCEPT THAT SHE BROUGHT A GOOD CHARACTER FROM HER LAST MISTRESS A MISSUS CROFTON I THINK THE NAME WAS WE WERE GLAD TO GET ANYBODY TO MAKE A VOYAGE LIKE THIS WELL SAYS PINE LOOK HERE
WAS LYING FLAT ON HIS BACK STARING AT THE DECK ABOVE HIM TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING HE WANTED TO SAY
LOSING PATIENCE WITH HIS PERVERSE AND STUPID COMPANION HOW CAN SHE GIVE US THE OFFICE WITH THAT COVE AT HER ELBOW GABBETT'S ONLY REPLY TO THIS QUESTION WAS A FEROCIOUS GRUNT AND A SUDDEN ELEVATION OF HIS CLENCHED FIST WHICH CAUSED MISTER VETCH TO RETREAT PRECIPITATELY
I DON'T CARE BUT SARAH CONSIDER AS IF A WOMAN IN LOVE EVER CONSIDERS SAID SHE TURNING UPON HIM A BURNING GLANCE WHICH IN TRUTH MIGHT HAVE MELTED A MORE ICY MAN THAN HE SHE LOVED HIM THEN WHAT A FOOL HE WOULD BE TO REFUSE
NO CAPTAIN VICKERS ALLOW ME AS SURGEON SUPERINTENDENT TO SETTLE OUR COURSE OF ACTION YOU ARE AWARE THAT THAT BY THE KING'S REGULATIONS YOU ARE INVESTED WITH FULL POWERS INTERRUPTED VICKERS
HE PAUSES AND LOOKS ROUND WITH SUCH AN IMPERTINENTLY CONFIDENT AIR THAT
AND THEN MAKING A HALF TURN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MOTION OF THE VESSEL FELL INTO HIS BUNK AND SNORED LIKE A GRAMPUS SARAH PURFOY WATCHED HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN HAVING BLOWN OUT THE LIGHT
AND FORCED CLOSE UPON YET SHRINKING BACK FROM THE TRAMPLED AND BLOODY MASS CROUCHED IN MINGLED TERROR AND RAGE THE TWENTY MUTINEERS BEHIND THE MUTINEERS WITHDRAWN FROM THE PATCH OF LIGHT THROWN BY THE OPEN HATCHWAY THE MOUTH OF THE HOWITZER THREATENED DESTRUCTION
JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE CROWD IN THE GANGWAY RECOIL FROM THE FLASH OF THE MUSKET FIRED BY VICKERS THE NEXT INSTANT PINE AND TWO SOLDIERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE MOMENTARY CESSATION OF THE PRESS SHOT THE BOLTS AND SECURED THE PRISON
AT ALL EVENTS WE ARE COMPLETELY IGNORANT OF THE NATURE OF THE PLOT AND THE NAMES OF THE RINGLEADERS LET US DOUBLE THE SENTRIES AND QUIETLY GET THE MEN UNDER ARMS
REX YES YES I'M COMING DON'T BE IN A HURRY THE SENTRY'S SAFE AND THE HOWITZER IS BUT FIVE PACES FROM THE DOOR A RUSH UPON DECK LADS AND SHE'S OURS THAT IS MINE MINE AND MY WIFE'S MISSUS LIONEL CROFTON OF SEVEN CROFTS
RAPIDLY UNBOLTED THAT TRAP DOOR IN THE BARRICADE OF WHICH MENTION HAS BEEN MADE IN A PREVIOUS CHAPTER AND AT A SIGNAL FROM VICKERS THREE MEN RAN THE LOADED HOWITZER FROM ITS SINISTER SHELTER NEAR THE BREAK OF THE BARRACK BERTHS AND
WRITING BLUNT WAS IN HIS CABIN AND PINE WITH TWO CARPENTERS AT WORK UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS WAS IMPROVISING INCREASED HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION THE NOISE OF MALLET AND HAMMER ECHOED IN THE SOLDIERS BERTH OMINOUSLY
TELL EM THE WHISPER BEING HEARD BY THOSE NEAREST THE GIANT A SILENCE ENSUES WHICH GRADUALLY SPREADS LIKE A RIPPLE OVER THE SURFACE OF THE CROWD REACHING EVEN THE BUNKS AT THE FURTHER END GENTLEMEN
INTERRUPTS THE GIANT ANGRILY COME TO BUSINESS CARN'T YER TELL EM THEY MAY LIKE IT OR LUMP IT BUT WE MEAN TO HAVE THE SHIP AND THEM AS REFUSES TO JOIN US WE MEAN TO CHUCK OVERBOARD THAT'S ABOUT THE PLAIN ENGLISH OF IT
NO OAKS SARAH PURFOY LADY'S MAID AND NURSE HA HA LADY'S MAID AND NURSE THIS LAST SENTENCE CONTAINED THE NAME CLUE TO THE LABYRINTH IN WHICH RUFUS DAWES'S BEWILDERED INTELLECTS WERE WANDERING
SUPPOSE WE TELL THESE SCOUNDRELS THAT THEIR DESIGN WHATEVER IT MAY BE IS KNOWN VERY GOOD THEY WILL PROFESS ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE AND TRY AGAIN ON THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY WHEN PERHAPS WE MAY NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
THE MUTINEERS HEADED BY GABBETT VETCH AND THE MOOCHER WERE NEAREST TO THE DOOR THE TIMID BOYS OLD MEN INNOCENT POOR WRETCHES CONDEMNED ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OR RUSTICS CONDEMNED TO BE TURNED INTO THIEVES FOR PULLING A TURNIP
BUT WHAT CAN ONE DO COME LET US GET ON DECK SAID VICKERS WITH A SHUDDER OF DISGUST RUFUS DAWES FELT THE SWEAT BREAK OUT INTO BEADS ON HIS FOREHEAD THEY SUSPECTED NOTHING THEY WERE GOING AWAY HE MUST WARN THEM
RESPONDED TO HIS GRIN OF ENCOURAGEMENT BY RUSHING FURIOUSLY FORWARD SUDDENLY A HORRIBLE ROAR LIKE THAT OF A TRAPPED WILD BEAST WAS HEARD THE RUSHING TORRENT CHOKED IN THE DOORWAY
WHY I'VE GIVEN FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS FOR A FREAK OF MY GIRL SARAH
LAUGHS A LAUGH OF MINGLED FEROCITY AND AMUSEMENT NOT REASSURING TO TIMID PEOPLE WHAT ABOUT THE SOGERS ASKED A VOICE FROM THE RANKS OF THE CAUTIOUS
PINE TURNED ROUND UPON HIM WITH THAT GRIM PRACTICALITY WHICH WAS A PART OF HIS NATURE HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE SAFETY OF THE SHIP CAPTAIN VICKERS YOU KNOW OR HAVE HEARD OF THE SORT OF THINGS THAT TAKE PLACE IN THESE MUTINIES
A GLANCE UP THE HATCHWAY SHOWED THE GIANT THAT THE ARMS HE HAD PLANNED TO SEIZE WERE DEFENDED BY TEN FIRELOCKS AND THAT BEHIND THE OPEN DOORS OF THE PARTITION WHICH RAN ABAFT THE MIZENMAST THE REMAINDER OF THE DETACHMENT STOOD TO THEIR ARMS
AS SHE DREW HER DARK CLOAK AROUND HER AND TAPPED AT FRERE'S DOOR
AND WE'RE IN AMONG THE GUARD AFORE THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE DRAG EM BACK INTO THE PRISON
AND TO GIVE EFFECT TO HER WORDS LOOKED ROUND THE DECK HER GLANCE CROSSED THAT OF THE YOUNG SOLDIER ON THE FORECASTLE
IT SEEMED THAT THERE WAS SOMEBODY WITH HIM FOR A KIND THOUGH SOMEWHAT POMPOUS VOICE REMARKED UPON THE SCANTINESS OF ACCOMMODATION AND THE NECESSITY THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF COMPLYING WITH THE KING'S REGULATIONS
THE WOMAN WHO HELD IN HER HANDS THE TWO ENDS OF THE CHAIN THAT WOULD PRODUCE THIS SPARK PAUSED CAME UP UPON DECK AND AFTER A GLANCE ROUND LEANT AGAINST THE POOP RAILING AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE BARRICADE
OF THE GIANT'S BRISTLING SCALP AND BARED GUMS NOW CRIES JEMMY VETCH AS THE IRON PLATED OAK SWUNG BACK AND WITH THE GUTTURAL SNARL OF A CHARGING WILD BOAR
YET LIVED ALL AT ONCE A VOICE CALLED OUT
YOU HAVE TOLD ME THAT SO OFTEN SAYS SHE WITH A POUT HAVE YOU NOTHING ELSE TO SAY EXCEPT THAT I LOVE YOU THIS IN A MOST IMPASSIONED MANNER THAT IS NO NEWS I KNOW YOU DO CURSE IT SARAH WHAT IS A FELLOW TO DO HIS PROFLIGACY WAS FAILING HIM RAPIDLY
KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF THE WHOLE MATTER VICKERS ORDERED ALL THE MEN SAVE THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ON GUARD DURING THE DAY TO BE UNDER ARMS IN THE BARRACK FORBADE COMMUNICATION WITH THE UPPER DECK AND PLACED AS SENTRY AT THE BARRACK DOOR HIS OWN SERVANT
SAYS THE GIANT LICKING HIS COARSE BLUE LIPS
WHICH BELIED HER WORDS AND WHICH PENETRATED EVEN THE SODDEN INTELLECT OF POOR BLUNT HE BALANCED HIMSELF ON HIS HEELS FOR A MOMENT AND HOLDING BY THE MOULDING OF THE CABIN STARED AT HER WITH A FATUOUS SMILE OF DRUNKEN ADMIRATION
FOR AT THE SAME MOMENT A YOUNG SOLDIER RAN UP THE LADDER TO THE FORECASTLE AND EAGERLY BENT HIS GAZE IN HER DIRECTION MAURICE FRERE HAD COME BEHIND HER AND TOUCHED HER ON THE SHOULDER
DISPOSED IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE DAY BEFORE EVEN MISTER MAURICE FRERE RECOVERED FROM HIS MIDNIGHT FATIGUES WAS LOUNGING ON THE SAME COIL OF ROPE IN PRECISELY THE SAME POSITION YET THE EYE OF AN ACUTE OBSERVER
THIS PRACTICAL WAY OF PUTTING IT PRODUCES A SENSATION AND THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AT THE OTHER END LOOK IN EACH OTHER'S FACES WITH SOME ALARM A GRIM MURMUR RUNS ROUND AND SOMEBODY NEAR MISTER GABBETT
FOUGHT ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING WHOM THEY STRUCK GABBETT TORE A CUTLASS FROM A SOLDIER SHOOK HIS HUGE HEAD AND CALLING ON THE MOOCHER TO FOLLOW BOUNDED UP THE LADDER DESPERATELY DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE FIRE OF THE WATCH THE MOOCHER
BUT IF YOU USE THAT ARGUMENT TO THEM WHEN THEY HAVE TAKEN THE VESSEL IT WON'T AVAIL YOU MUCH LET ME MANAGE SIR AND FOR GOD'S SAKE SAY NOTHING TO ANYBODY OUR LIVES MAY HANG UPON A WORD
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE MOST NOBLE KNUCKLER SAYS THE CROW WITH AFFECTED CARELESSNESS GIVE THE YOUNG WOMAN TIME
HICCUPED WITH MUCH SOLEMNITY THRICE AND AS THOUGH STRUCK WITH A SUDDEN SENSE OF DUTY UNFULFILLED SWALLOWED THE CONTENTS AT A GULP THE EFFECT WAS ALMOST INSTANTANEOUS HE DROPPED THE TUMBLER LURCHED TOWARDS THE WOMAN AT THE DOOR
OR SYMPTOM OF PANIC THE FACE OF EACH MAN SOLDIER SAILOR OR PRISONER WORE AN EXPECTANT LOOK AS THOUGH HE WONDERED WHOSE TURN WOULD COME NEXT ON THE SHIP ROLLING CEASELESSLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
I'M FOR BIZNESS AT ONCE THERE LOOK AT THAT HE ADDED WITH AN OATH AS THE FIGURE OF MAURICE FRERE APPEARED SIDE BY SIDE WITH THAT OF THE WAITING MAID AND THE TWO TURNED AWAY UP THE DECK TOGETHER IT'S ALL RIGHT YOU CONFOUNDED MUDDLEHEAD CRIED THE CROW
SAYS MISTER VETCH POLITELY SARCASTIC IN HIS OWN HANGDOG FASHION MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS HERE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE SHIP FOR YOU THOSE WHO LIKE TO JOIN US HAD BETTER SPEAK AT ONCE FOR IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
OCCUPIED THE MIDDLE SPACE THE MUTINEERS PROPER NUMBERED PERHAPS SOME THIRTY MEN AND OF THESE THIRTY ONLY HALF A DOZEN KNEW WHAT WAS REALLY ABOUT TO BE DONE THE SHIP'S BELL STRIKES THE HALF HOUR
AN OLD SOLDIER ON WHOSE FIDELITY HE COULD THOROUGHLY RELY HE THEN DOUBLED THE GUARDS TOOK THE KEYS OF THE PRISON HIMSELF FROM THE NON COMMISSIONED OFFICER WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO KEEP THEM AND SAW THAT THE HOWITZER ON THE LOWER DECK WAS LOADED WITH GRAPE
SARAH ALLOWED A LAUGH TO ESCAPE HER AND ARTFULLY PROTRUDED AN ANKLE AT THE SAME TIME THE AMOROUS PHINEAS LURCHED OVER AND MADE SHIFT TO TAKE HER HAND YOU LOVSH ME AND I HIC LOVSH YOU SARAH
I AM NOT A CRUEL MAN SIR BUT WE HAVE GOT A CARGO OF WILD BEASTS ABOARD AND WE MUST BE CAREFUL BUT SURELY MISTER PINE HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE PROBABLE LOSS OF LIFE I REALLY SOME MORE HUMANE COURSE PERHAPS PREVENTION YOU KNOW
AND WITH A QUICK UPWARD GLANCE THAT WORTHY FELLOW PICKED IT UP AND BROUGHT IT TO HER OH THANK YOU CAPTAIN BLUNT
AND WHICH BY A STRONG EXERCISE OF WILL SHE HAD STRUGGLED AGAINST ENCOURAGED BY THE VIOLENT EXCITEMENT OF THE OCCASION HAD ATTACKED HER AT THIS SUPREME MOMENT
AND THE TAP TAP TAP TAP OF PINE'S HAMMERS AT WORK UPON THE NEW PARTITION BY AND BY
CONFIDENT THAT ONE SECOND WOULD BE ENOUGH ONE MINUTE TO GO QUIETLY OR SURRENDER MATES FOR GOD'S SAKE SHRIEKED SOME UNKNOWN WRETCH
SEEN NONSENSE WHO IS TO SEE YOU CAPTAIN VICKERS DOCTOR PINE ANYBODY NOT THEY BESIDES
HE WAS AS ONE POSSESSED HE COULD MOVE NOR HAND NOR FOOT THE PLACE WHERE HE LAY WAS BUT DIMLY LIGHTED THE INGENUITY OF PINE HAD CONSTRUCTED A CANVAS BLIND
THE WORKMEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN MAKING COFFINS THE PRISON WAS STRANGELY SILENT WITH THE LOWERING SILENCE WHICH PRECEDES A THUNDERSTORM AND THE CONVICTS ON DECK NO LONGER TOLD STORIES NOR LAUGHED AT OBSCENE JESTS BUT SAT TOGETHER
THE FISHING LINES STILL HUNG DANGLING OVER THE CATHEADS BUT NOBODY TOUCHED THEM THE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS ON THE FORECASTLE COLLECTED IN KNOTS HAD NO HEART EVEN TO SMOKE BUT GLOOMILY STARED AT EACH OTHER VICKERS WAS IN THE CUDDY
AND HAD STERNLY COME TO VISIT THE SICK MEN AWARE AS HE WAS THAT SUCH A VISIT WOULD NECESSITATE HIS ISOLATION FROM THE CABIN WHERE HIS CHILD LAY MISSUS VICKERS
AND THE ARMS WHICH IN THE DAYTIME WERE DISPOSED ON THE TOP OF THE ARM CHEST WERE PLACED IN AN ARM RACK CONSTRUCTED ON THE QUARTER DECK FOR THAT PURPOSE TRUSTING NOTHING TO FRERE WHO INDEED BY PINE'S ADVICE WAS AS WE HAVE SEEN
BEATEN BACK STRUGGLING AND INDIGNANT AMID THE STORM OF HIDEOUS FACES HIS HUMANITY VANISHED AND HE AIMED DELIBERATELY AT THE HEAD OF MISTER JAMES VETCH THE SHOT HOWEVER MISSED ITS MARK AND KILLED THE UNHAPPY MILES
BUT THE NEXT INSTANT VICKERS HAD SNATCHED THE FIRELOCK FROM HIM AND LEAPING INTO THE STREAM
THE GIRL WAS EVIDENTLY PLAYING WITH HIM AND HE WOULD SHOW HER THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH WELL SARAH WELL MISTER FRERE DROPPING HER HAND AND TURNING ROUND WITH A SMILE HOW WELL YOU ARE LOOKING TO DAY POSITIVELY LOVELY
HE CLOSED HIS EYES WITH A TERRIBLE SIGH OF DESPAIR AND RESIGNED HIMSELF TO HIS FATE AT THAT INSTANT THE SOUND OF HAMMERING CEASED AND THE DOOR OPENED IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK AND PINE HAD COME TO HAVE A LAST LOOK AT HIS PATIENTS BEFORE DINNER
SHE HUNG UPON HIM WITH ALL HER WEIGHT HER LONG HAIR SWEPT ACROSS HIS FACE HER WARM BREATH WAS ON HIS CHEEK HER DRESS EXPOSED HER ROUND SMOOTH SHOULDER HE INTOXICATED CONQUERED HAD HALF TURNED BACK WHEN SUDDENLY THE RICH CRIMSON
MISSUS LIONEL CROFTON OF THE CROFTS SEVENOAKS KENT SEVENOAKS KENT SEVEN A GLEAM OF LIGHT BROKE IN ON THE DARKNESS WHICH WRAPPED RUFUS DAWES'S TORTURED BRAIN THE MAN WAS JOHN REX HIS BERTH MATE WITH AN EFFORT HE SPOKE
THE MUTINY HAD BEGUN THE SOUND AWOKE THE SOLDIER TO A SENSE OF HIS DUTY HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND DISENGAGING THE ARMS THAT CLUNG ABOUT HIS NECK MADE FOR THE DOOR THE MOMENT FOR WHICH THE CONVICT'S ACCOMPLICE HAD WAITED APPROACHED
HAD OFTEN SAID THAT POOR DEAR JOHN WAS SUCH A DISCIPLINARIAN QUITE A SLAVE TO THE SERVICE HERE THEY ARE SAID PINE SIX OF EM THIS FELLOW
HARK THE CLOCK IS STRIKING NINE FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT WELL YOU'VE HAD YOUR DAY AND CAN'T COMPLAIN A DANGEROUS FELLOW SAYS PINE WITH THE LIGHT UPRAISED A VERY DANGEROUS FELLOW
DID YOU TAKE THE LAUDANUM WHISPERED BLUNT WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE SOME OF IT SAID SHE I WILL BRING YOU BACK THE BOTTLE TO NIGHT BLUNT WALKED AFT HUMMING CHEERILY AND SALUTED FRERE WITH A SLAP ON THE BACK THE TWO MEN LAUGHED EACH AT HIS OWN THOUGHTS
AND A PRESHUS TIGHT LITTLE CRAFT YOU HIC ARE GIV'SH KISS SARAH SARAH GOT UP AND WENT TO THE DOOR WOTSH THIS GOIN SARAH DON'T GO AND HE STAGGERED UP
WHO KNOWS I DON'T CONFOUND EM HE ADDED WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO US WE DON'T WANT THEM DO WE SARAH SHE SEEMED TO BE LISTENING FOR SOMETHING AND DID NOT REPLY HER NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS WOUND UP TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF EXCITEMENT
INCAPABLE OF FURTHER SPEECH MADE A LAST EFFORT TO NOD ASSENT BUT HIS HEAD FELL UPON HIS BREAST THE NEXT MOMENT THE FLICKERING LIGHT
GABBETT AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD BY THIS TIME REACHED THE FOOT OF THE COMPANION LADDER THERE TO ENCOUNTER THE CUTLASSES OF THE DOUBLED GUARD GLEAMING REDLY IN THE GLOW OF THE LANTERNS
BUT THE GUARD HAD ALREADY CLOSED IN UPON IT AND SOME OF THE SHIP'S CREW WITH THAT CARELESSNESS OF DANGER CHARACTERISTIC OF SAILORS WERE PEERING DOWN UPON THEM ESCAPE WAS HOPELESS ONE MINUTE CRIED VICKERS
YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID MISTER VETCH CONTINUES WE HAVE ARRANGED IT ALL FOR YOU THERE ARE FRIENDS WAITING FOR US OUTSIDE AND THE DOOR WILL BE OPEN DIRECTLY ALL WE WANT GENTLEMEN IS YOUR VOTE AND INTEREST I MEAN YOUR
THERE WAS AN AWFUL MOMENT OF SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY A SKURRYING NOISE IN THE PRISON AS THOUGH A FAMILY OF RATS DISTURBED AT A FLOUR CASK WERE SCAMPERING TO THE SHIP'S SIDE FOR SHELTER
A FLASH BROKE FOLLOWED BY A GROAN AS THE PERFIDIOUS SENTRY FELL BACK SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST THE MASS IN THE DOORWAY HUNG IRRESOLUTE AND THEN BY SHEER WEIGHT OF PRESSURE FROM BEHIND BURST FORWARD AND AS IT SO BURST
IT WAS AS THOUGH A SEA BREAKING AGAINST A STONE WALL HAD FOUND SOME BREACH
THE GIANT DID NOT FOLLOW AND MISTER VETCH FOLDING HIS ARMS AND ASSUMING AN ATTITUDE OF EASY CONTEMPT DIRECTED HIS ATTENTION TO SARAH PURFOY SHE SEEMED AN OBJECT OF GENERAL ATTRACTION
AND UPON THE GROUP BEFORE THE BARRICADE HAD FALLEN THAT MYSTERIOUS SILENCE WHICH HAD PERPLEXED THE INMATES OF THE PRISON THEY WERE NOT PERPLEXED FOR LONG THE TWO SOLDIERS WHO WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF PINE HAD FORCED TO THE DOOR OF THE PRISON
HIS GREY HAIR WAS MATTED ALL WAYS ABOUT HIS REDDENED FACE AND HE WAS WINKING AND BLINKING LIKE AN OWL IN THE SUNSHINE HE HAD DRUNK A LARGER QUANTITY OF WINE THAN USUAL AT DINNER IN SHEER DELIGHT AT THE APPROACHING ASSIGNATION
THE SUCCESS OF THE PLOT DEPENDED ON THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES
AND AS FRERE LEFT HER SHE TURNED AND WITH HER EYES FIXED ON THE CONVICT BARRICADE DROPPED THE HANDKERCHIEF SHE HELD IN HER HAND OVER THE POOP RAILING IT FELL AT THE FEET OF THE AMOROUS CAPTAIN
I WILL COME AT EIGHT O'CLOCK SAID SHE WITH MODESTLY AVERTED FACE THEY RELIEVE THE GUARD AT EIGHT HE SAID DEPRECATINGLY SHE TOSSED HER HEAD VERY WELL THEN
THE TONE WAS AN ORDINARY ONE AND MILES WAS THE SOLDIER WHOM SARAH PURFOY HAD BRIBED NOT TO FIRE ALL HAD GONE WELL THE KEYS CLASHED AND TURNED AND THE BRAVEST OF THE PRUDENT PARTY
HE MADE AN EFFORT TO SPEAK BUT HIS TONGUE CLOVE TO THE ROOF OF HIS MOUTH AND HIS JAWS STUCK TOGETHER HE COULD NOT RAISE A FINGER NOR UTTER A SOUND THE BOARDS OVER HIS HEAD WAVED LIKE A SHAKEN SHEET AND THE CABIN WHIRLED ROUND
AND FOR A MOMENT MISTER FRERE'S CHERISHED EXISTENCE HUNG UPON THE SLENDEREST THREAD IMAGINABLE THE MOOCHER SPATTERED WITH THE BLOOD AND BRAINS OF HIS UNFORTUNATE COMRADE HAD ALREADY SET HIS FOOT UPON THE LOWEST STEP OF THE LADDER
ON EACH SIDE OF THIS HORRIBLE WINDOW ALMOST PUSHED BEFORE IT BY THE PRESSURE OF ONE UPON THE OTHER STOOD PINE VICKERS AND THE GUARD IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE GROUP LAY THE CORPSE OF THE MISERABLE BOY WHOM SARAH PURFOY HAD LED TO RUIN
WHO HAD BEEN TURNING IN HIS MIND THE NOTION OF RISKING HIS LIFE FOR A PARDON TO BE WON BY RUSHING FORWARD AT THE RIGHT MOMENT AND ALARMING THE GUARD CHECKED THE CRY THAT WAS IN HIS THROAT AS HE SAW THE MEN ROUND THE DOOR DRAW BACK A LITTLE FOR THEIR RUSH AND CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
WOULD HAVE SEEN AN UNUSUAL SIGHT THAT GALLANT COMMANDER WAS SITTING ON THE BED PLACE WITH A GLASS OF RUM AND WATER IN HIS HAND AND THE HANDSOME WAITING MAID OF MISSUS VICKERS WAS SEATED ON A STOOL BY HIS SIDE AT A FIRST GLANCE IT WAS PERCEPTIBLE THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS VERY DRUNK
BY AND BY IN SOME INEXPLICABLE WAY IT CAME TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY AFLOAT THAT THEY WERE TO BE RELEASED FROM THEIR SHAMBLES THAT SOME AMONGST THEM HAD BEEN PLOTTING FOR FREEDOM THE TWEEN DECKS HELD ITS FOUL BREATH
SARAH'S RIGHT WAIT TILL SHE GIVES THE WORD HE'S RAVING SAID VICKERS PINE CAUGHT THE CONVICT BY THE SHOULDER WHAT DO YOU SAY MY MAN A MUTINY OF THE PRISONERS WITH HIS MOUTH AGAPE AND HIS HANDS CLENCHED RUFUS DAWES
THE ATTACK WAS MORE SUDDEN THEN HE HAD EXPECTED BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND THE SHOT WOULD SERVE A DOUBLE PURPOSE IT WOULD WARN THE MEN IN THE BARRACK AND PERHAPS CHECK THE RUSH BY STOPPING UP THE DOORWAY WITH A CORPSE
ALL THIS TOOK PLACE BY ONE OF THOSE SIMULTANEOUS MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE SO RAPID IN EXECUTION SO TEDIOUS TO DESCRIBE IN DETAIL AT ONE INSTANT THE PRISON DOOR HAD OPENED AT THE NEXT IT HAD CLOSED
WHEN THE CUTLASS WAS DASHED FROM HIS HAND BY A BLOW FROM A CLUBBED FIRELOCK AND HE WAS DRAGGED ROUGHLY BACKWARDS AS HE FELL UPON THE DECK HE SAW THE CROW SPRING OUT OF THE MASS OF PRISONERS WHO HAD BEEN AN INSTANT BEFORE STRUGGLING WITH THE GUARD AND
THE REPORT OF ANOTHER SHOT AND THEN A NOISE OF CONFUSED CRIES MINGLED WITH THE CLASHING OF ARMS INFORMED THE IMPRISONED MEN THAT THE SHIP HAD BEEN ALARMED
THE WHOLE THING IS PERHAPS SOME ABSURDITY OF THAT FELLOW DAWES AND SHOULD WE ONCE PUT THE NOTION OF ATTACKING US INTO THE PRISONERS HEADS THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT THEY MIGHT DO BUT THE MAN SEEMED CERTAIN SAID THE OTHER HE MENTIONED MY WIFE'S MAID TOO
THE CONTAGION OF BATTLE SPREAD CAUTION WAS FORGOTTEN
HUDDLING TOGETHER IN ALARM AND THE PRUDENT THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE REST READY TO FIGHT OR FLY ADVANCE OR RETREAT
IT BECAME A VIOLATION OF NATURE AND WAS SO FAR YOU SEE CRIMINAL IT IS FOR THIS REASON AN PLEASE YOUR REVERENCES THAT KEY HOLES ARE THE OCCASIONS OF MORE SIN AND WICKEDNESS THAN ALL OTHER HOLES
AND YET EXCEPTING ONCE THAT HE WAS BEGUILED INTO IT BY MISSUS WADMAN HE HAD NEVER LOOKED STEDFASTLY INTO ONE AND WOULD OFTEN TELL MY FATHER IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART
WITHOUT FIRST RECOMMENDING THYSELF TO THE PROTECTION OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HE MAY DEFEND THEE FROM THE EVIL ONE SHAVE THE WHOLE TOP OF THY CROWN CLEAN
AND GIVE HIM AT LEAST A SORT OF COUSINSHIP TO THE QUARTER SESSIONS ALL THIS WHICH WAS THE SIMPLE TRUTH WOULD HAVE SEEMED EXTREMELY FLAT TO THE GOSSIPS OF MILBY WHO HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE EXCITING
A THOUSAND OF MY FATHER'S MOST SUBTLE SYLLOGISMS COULD NOT HAVE SAID MORE FOR CELIBACY MY UNCLE TOBY LOOK'D EARNESTLY TOWARDS HIS COTTAGE AND HIS BOWLING GREEN
THOUGH THE CORPORAL HAD BEEN AS GOOD AS HIS WORD IN PUTTING MY UNCLE TOBY'S GREAT RAMALLIE WIG INTO PIPES YET THE TIME WAS TOO SHORT TO PRODUCE ANY GREAT EFFECTS FROM IT IT HAD LAIN MANY YEARS SQUEEZED UP IN THE CORNER OF HIS OLD CAMPAIGN TRUNK
AS PERSONAGES ON THE DEBATABLE GROUND BETWEEN ARISTOCRACY AND COMMONALTY INSTEAD OF SETTLING IN SOME SPOT WHERE HIS FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR MIGHT HAVE WON HIM THE DEFINITE DIGNITY OF A PAROCHIAL MAGNATE
SO THAT THE WHIMSICALITY OF MY FATHER'S BRAIN WAS FAR FROM HAVING THE WHOLE HONOUR OF THIS AS IT HAD OF ALMOST ALL HIS OTHER STRANGE NOTIONS FOR IN A GREAT MEASURE HE MIGHT BE SAID TO HAVE SUCK'D THIS IN WITH HIS MOTHER'S MILK
THE HYPOTHESIS LIKE THE REST OF MY FATHER'S WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD BUT A SINGLE WORD TO OBJECT TO IT IN WHICH TRIM STOOD READY TO SECOND HIM BUT MY FATHER HAD NOT DRAWN HIS CONCLUSION
THE SEVEREST LADIES IN MILBY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY AWARE THAT THESE CHARACTERISTICS WOULD HAVE CREATED NO WIDE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI AND THEMSELVES AND SINCE IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS A WIDE DISTINCTION
WAS DIFFICULT TO BE MET WITH AT WATERING PLACES WHICH WERE ALREADY PREOCCUPIED WITH ABUNDANCE OF ANGLING BEAUTIES AND WERE CHIEFLY STOCKED WITH MEN WHOSE WHISKERS MIGHT BE DYED AND WHOSE INCOMES WERE STILL MORE PROBLEMATIC
WHOM HE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE PAS DE BAS AND THE LANCERS QUADRILLES SHE HAD HAD SEVEN YEARS OF SUFFICIENTLY HAPPY MATRIMONY WITH CZERLASKI WHO HAD TAKEN HER TO PARIS AND GERMANY
NOW MY GREAT GRANDFATHER'S NOSE WAS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE UNTO THE NOSES OF ALL THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHOM PANTAGRUEL FOUND DWELLING UPON THE ISLAND OF ENNASIN
MISS PHIPPS FOR HER PART DIDN'T LIKE DRESSING FOR EFFECT SHE HAD ALWAYS AVOIDED THAT STYLE OF APPEARANCE WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO CREATE A SENSATION
BUT NOT VAPOURINGLY AND WITH THE SWEETEST ACCENT OF MOST RESPECTFUL ENCOURAGEMENT BID HIS HONOUR NEVER FEAR NOW MY UNCLE TOBY DID FEAR AND GRIEVOUSLY TOO
IN SPITE OF HER ASSIDUOUS CHURCH GOING AND THE DEEP DISGUST SHE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED AT THE EXTREME PAUCITY OF THE CONGREGATIONS ON ASH WEDNESDAYS
HAD SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN DANCING LESSONS IN THE METROPOLIS THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN HER HALF BROTHER WHO BY UNIMPEACHED INTEGRITY AND INDUSTRY
S'DEATH CRIED MY GREAT GRANDFATHER CLAPPING HIS HAND UPON HIS NOSE
AND HERE AM I SITTING THIS TWELFTH DAY OF AUGUST SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX IN A PURPLE JERKIN AND YELLOW PAIR OF SLIPPERS WITHOUT EITHER WIG OR CAP ON A MOST TRAGICOMICAL COMPLETION OF HIS PREDICTION
MISTER BRIDMAIN IN FACT QUADRAGENARIAN BACHELOR AS HE WAS FELT EXTREMELY WELL PLEASED TO RECEIVE HIS SISTER IN HER WIDOWHOOD AND TO SHINE IN THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF HER BEAUTY AND TITLE
HAD WON A PARTNERSHIP IN A SILK MANUFACTORY AND THEREBY A MODERATE FORTUNE THAT ENABLED HIM TO RETIRE AS YOU SEE TO STUDY POLITICS THE WEATHER AND THE ART OF CONVERSATION AT HIS LEISURE
THEY ARE ALL BOOKS WHICH EXCITE LAUGHTER AND THOU KNOWEST DEAR TOBY THAT THERE IS NO PASSION SO SERIOUS AS LUST STICK A PIN IN THE BOSOM OF THY SHIRT BEFORE THOU ENTEREST HER PARLOUR
EVERY MAN WHO IS NOT A MONSTER A MATHEMATICIAN OR A MAD PHILOSOPHER IS THE SLAVE OF SOME WOMAN OR OTHER MISTER BRIDMAIN HAD PUT HIS NECK UNDER THE YOKE OF HIS HANDSOME SISTER AND THOUGH HIS SOUL WAS A VERY LITTLE ONE
LIKE A PIKE IT LOOKS WELL AT LEAST QUOTH MY FATHER TO HIMSELF
INFINITE WAS HIS PITY NOR WOULD THE MOST COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF ROMANCE HAVE GONE FURTHER AT LEAST UPON ONE LEG TO HAVE WIPED AWAY A TEAR FROM A WOMAN'S EYE
OR WHEN HE CHEW'D IT OR WHEN HE ROASTED IT OR WHEN HE PEEL'D OR WHEN HE BROUGHT IT HOME OR WHEN HE DIGESTED OR WHEN HE FOR TIS PLAIN SIR IF THE FIRST PICKING UP OF THE APPLE MADE IT NOT HIS THAT NO SUBSEQUENT ACT COULD
NICE DISTINCTIONS ARE TROUBLESOME IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO SAY THAT A THING IS BLACK THAN TO DISCRIMINATE THE PARTICULAR SHADE OF BROWN BLUE OR GREEN TO WHICH IT REALLY BELONGS
AND NATURE HAD MOREOVER WROTE GENTLEMAN WITH SO FAIR A HAND IN EVERY LINE OF HIS COUNTENANCE THAT EVEN HIS TARNISH'D GOLD LACED HAT AND HUGE COCKADE OF FLIMSY TAFFETA BECAME HIM
SUCH IT WAS OR RATHER SUCH WOULD IT HAVE SEEM'D UPON ANY OTHER BROW BUT THE SWEET LOOK OF GOODNESS WHICH SAT UPON MY UNCLE TOBY'S ASSIMILATED EVERY THING AROUND IT SO SOVEREIGNLY TO ITSELF
YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL KNOWS OF TOM'S MISFORTUNES BUT THIS AFFAIR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM ANY FURTHER THAN THIS
AND MY FATHER TAKING THAT VERY CRISIS TO FALL IN HELTER SKELTER UPON THE WHOLE ORDER OF NUNS AND BEGUINES A SET OF SILLY FUSTY BAGGAGES SLOP COULD NOT STAND IT AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAVING SOME MEASURES TO TAKE ABOUT HIS BREECHES
AND WHICH WOULD BE UTTERLY OVERTURNED AND NULLIFIED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT PREMISS MISSUS PHIPPS THE BANKER'S WIFE AND MISSUS LANDOR THE ATTORNEY'S WIFE HAD INVESTED PART OF THEIR REPUTATION FOR ACUTENESS
COULD HAVE VENTED SUCH AN INSINUATION HE WAS HOWEVER FRANK AND GENEROUS IN HIS NATURE AND AT ALL TIMES OPEN TO CONVICTION SO THAT HE HAD SCARCE GOT TO THE LAST WORD OF THIS UNGRACIOUS RETORT
WHILST I AM POURING FORTH THE WARMEST SENTIMENT OF LOVE FOR THEE AND VENERATION FOR THE EXCELLENCY OF THY CHARACTER THAT EVER VIRTUE AND NATURE KINDLED IN A NEPHEW'S BOSOM
ONE OF THESE CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT THERE WERE THINGS MORE SOLID IN LIFE THAN FINE WHISKERS AND A TITLE AND THAT IN ACCEPTING A SECOND HUSBAND
THEN WHAT AMUSING INNUENDOES OF THE MILBY GENTLEMEN OVER THEIR WINE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY FRUSTRATED AND REDUCED TO NOUGHT IF YOU HAD TOLD THEM THAT THE COUNTESS HAD REALLY BEEN GUILTY OF NO MISDEMEANOURS WHICH DEMANDED HER EXCLUSION FROM STRICTLY RESPECTABLE SOCIETY
FOR EACH MAN'S NEED THOU HADST A SHILLING WHILST I AM WORTH ONE TO PAY A WEEDER THY PATH FROM THY DOOR TO THY BOWLING GREEN SHALL NEVER BE GROWN UP
BUT THE ACCOUNT OF THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN TO BE WOVE INTO THE FAG END OF THE EIGHTH ALLUDING TO THE FIRST EDITION VOLUME OF SUCH A WORK AS THIS
IN A PERIOD OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE THEY HAD BEEN MADE BY A TOTAL INACTIVITY IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S LIFE FOR HE SELDOM WENT FURTHER THAN THE BOWLING GREEN
YOU MUST MEAN YOUR UNCLE'S REPLIED MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS CONVINCED HE UNTWISTED THE PAPER AND SIGNED THE ARTICLE
WHILST MY FATHER WAS WRITING HIS LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL WERE BUSY IN PREPARING EVERY THING FOR THE ATTACK AS THE TURNING OF THE THIN SCARLET BREECHES WAS LAID ASIDE AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT
TWOULD HAVE COST HER LADYSHIP A SMILE IT CURL'D EVERY WHERE BUT WHERE THE CORPORAL WOULD HAVE IT AND WHERE A BUCKLE OR TWO IN HIS OPINION WOULD HAVE DONE IT HONOUR HE COULD AS SOON HAVE RAISED THE DEAD
NOW TRIM'S MONTERO CAP AS I ONCE TOLD YOU WAS HIS CONSTANT WAGER AND HAVING FURBISH'D IT UP THAT VERY NIGHT IN ORDER TO GO UPON THE ATTACK IT MADE THE ODDS LOOK MORE CONSIDERABLE
WHY IT MUST LIE IN THE POSSESSION OF SOME VICES FROM WHICH THEY WERE UNDENIABLY FREE HENCE IT CAME TO PASS THAT MILBY RESPECTABILITY REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI
THAT TWAS THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF HIS LIFE TO KEEP ALL FANCIES OF THAT KIND OUT OF HER HEAD NATURE HAD DONE HER PART TO HAVE SPARED HIM THIS TROUBLE AND WHAT WAS NOT A LITTLE INCONSISTENT MY FATHER KNEW IT
WHICH HAVING LITTLE OR NO MEANING IN THEM NATURE IS OFT TIMES OBLIGED TO FIND ONE AND AS FOR MY FATHER'S EXAMPLE TWAS SO FAR FROM BEING EITHER AIDING OR ABETTING THEREUNTO
A THIN BLUE CHILL PELLUCID CHRYSTAL WITH ALL ITS HUMOURS SO AT REST THE LEAST MOTE OR SPECK OF DESIRE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF IT HAD IT EXISTED
BUT THAT WAS NOT THY TRANSGRESSION MY DEAR UNCLE HERE BUT WHY HERE RATHER THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF MY STORY I AM NOT ABLE TO TELL BUT HERE IT IS MY HEART STOPS ME
STILL THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY NO MEANS ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED THE OBJECT SHE HAD IN VIEW WHEN SHE CAME TO MILBY AND IT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME CLEAR TO HER THAT SHE MUST SUGGEST A NEW CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO HER BROTHER
THAT IT MUST BE ONE OF THE GREATEST PROBLEMS IN CIVIL LIFE WHERE THE SAME NUMBER OF LONG AND JOLLY NOSES FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER IN A DIRECT LINE
THAT WIDOW WADMAN HAS BEEN DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH MY BROTHER TOBY FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS USED EVERY ART AND CIRCUMVENTION OF WOMAN TO OUTWIT HIM INTO THE SAME PASSION YET NOW THAT SHE HAS CAUGHT HIM HER FEVER WILL BE PASS'D ITS HEIGHT
AND SHUNS A COLDLY SATIRICAL EYE AS SHE WOULD SHUN A GORGON AND SHE WAS ESPECIALLY EAGER FOR CLERICAL NOTICE AND FRIENDSHIP NOT MERELY BECAUSE THAT IS QUITE THE MOST RESPECTABLE COUNTENANCE TO BE OBTAINED IN SOCIETY
WHO CONSIDERS SUCH SLIGHT BLEMISHES SUCH MORAL PIMPLES AS THESE DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR ENTERING INTO THE MOST RESPECTABLE SOCIETY INDEED
THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER FOR THEE WHICH OCCURS TO ME AT PRESENT UNLESS THE BREAKING OUT OF A FRESH WAR SO WISHING EVERY THING DEAR TOBY FOR BEST I REST THY AFFECTIONATE BROTHER WALTER SHANDY
AND HAD AN UNEASY SENSE THAT SHE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SAFE IN THAT QUARTER SHE HAD SERIOUS INTENTIONS OF BECOMING QUITE PIOUS WITHOUT ANY RESERVES WHEN SHE HAD ONCE GOT HER CARRIAGE AND SETTLEMENT
WHATEVER THOU HAST TO SAY BE IT MORE OR LESS FORGET NOT TO UTTER IT IN A LOW SOFT TONE OF VOICE SILENCE AND WHATEVER APPROACHES IT WEAVES DREAMS OF MIDNIGHT SECRECY INTO THE BRAIN
MY UNCLE TOBY TURN'D HIS HEAD MORE THAN ONCE BEHIND HIM TO SEE HOW HE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CORPORAL AND THE CORPORAL AS OFT AS HE DID IT GAVE A SLIGHT FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK
FOR YOU HAVE ALREADY PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS ONE BEING TO WHOM THE COUNTESS WAS ABSORBINGLY DEVOTED AND TO WHOSE DESIRES SHE MADE EVERYTHING ELSE SUBSERVIENT NAMELY CAROLINE CZERLASKI NEE BRIDMAIN
SHE CANNOT QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY HALTING WHEN THEY HAD MARCH'D UP TO WITHIN TWENTY PACES OF MISSUS WADMAN'S DOOR SHE CANNOT CORPORAL TAKE IT AMISS
SO SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD MISCALCULATED THE ADVANTAGES OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S PRIVATE AFFAIRS
AND TO SHORTEN ALL DESCRIPTION THEY SHONE SO BRIGHT AGAINST THE SUN THAT MORNING AND HAD SO METALLICK AND DOUGHTY AN AIR WITH THEM THAT HAD MY UNCLE TOBY THOUGHT OF ATTACKING IN ARMOUR NOTHING COULD HAVE SO WELL IMPOSED UPON HIS IMAGINATION
DID HE READ SUCH BOOKS AND OBSERVE SUCH FACTS AND THINK SUCH THOUGHTS AS WOULD ETERNALLY BE MAKING HIM CHANGE SIDES NOW MY FATHER AS I TOLD YOU LAST YEAR DETESTED ALL THIS HE PICK'D UP AN OPINION SIR
WHEN ONCE A POOR CREATURE IS IN HE IS IN AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR FOR EVER TIS VERY TRUE SAID MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING GRAVELY AT MISSUS WADMAN'S HOUSE AS HE SPOKE NOTHING
THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH SHOULD PUT IT OFF BEYOND THE NEXT MORNING SO ACCORDINGLY IT WAS RESOLV'D UPON FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK
AS A MAN IN A STATE OF NATURE PICKS UP AN APPLE IT BECOMES HIS OWN AND IF HE IS A MAN OF SPIRIT HE WOULD LOSE HIS LIFE RATHER THAN GIVE IT UP
CONSCIENCE REDOUBLED HER BLOW HE TURN'D HIS FACE SUDDENLY THE OTHER WAY AND MY MOTHER SUPPOSING HIS BODY WAS ABOUT TO TURN WITH IT IN ORDER TO MOVE HOMEWARDS BY A CROSS MOVEMENT OF HER RIGHT LEG
WHAT WAS TO BE HAD HOWEVER HE SET THE GREATER STORE BY AND THOUGH MY FATHER WOULD OFT TIMES SPORT WITH MY UNCLE TOBY'S LIBRARY WHICH BY THE BYE WAS RIDICULOUS ENOUGH
FOR THIS CAUSE IF THOU CANST HELP IT NEVER THROW DOWN THE TONGS AND POKER AVOID ALL KINDS OF PLEASANTRY AND FACETIOUSNESS IN THY DISCOURSE WITH HER
THOUGH I PERCEIVE FROM A GLOW IN MY CHEEK THAT I BLUSH AS I BEGIN TO SPEAK TO THEE UPON THE SUBJECT AS WELL KNOWING NOTWITHSTANDING THY UNAFFECTED SECRECY HOW FEW OF ITS OFFICES THOU NEGLECTEST
WHEN HIS CONSCIENCE SMOTE HIM MY MOTHER WAS THEN CONJUGALLY SWINGING WITH HER LEFT ARM TWISTED UNDER HIS RIGHT IN SUCH WISE THAT THE INSIDE OF HER HAND RESTED UPON THE BACK OF HIS
INSTEAD OF LOOKING DOWN FROM A MOUNT OF VIRTUE WITH AN AUREOLE ROUND ITS HEAD WOULD THEN BE SEEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AND IN THE SAME LIGHT AS THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI'S DIANA LIKE FORM AND WELL CHOSEN DRAPERY
THERE WAS NOTHING HERE SO VERY DETESTABLE IT IS TRUE THE COUNTESS WAS A LITTLE VAIN A LITTLE AMBITIOUS A LITTLE SELFISH A LITTLE SHALLOW AND FRIVOLOUS A LITTLE GIVEN TO WHITE LIES BUT
MY FATHER HAD SUCH A SKIRMISHING CUTTING KIND OF A SLASHING WAY WITH HIM IN HIS DISPUTATIONS THRUSTING AND RIPPING AND GIVING EVERY ONE A STROKE TO REMEMBER HIM BY IN HIS TURN
BY THE WAY IF YOU WOULD KNOW THE STRANGE WAY OF GETTING A KIN AMONGST SO FLAT NOSED A PEOPLE YOU MUST READ THE BOOK FIND IT OUT YOURSELF YOU NEVER CAN
THE APPLE IS AS MUCH FRANK'S APPLE AS JOHN'S PRAY MISTER SHANDY WHAT PATENT HAS HE TO SHEW FOR IT AND HOW DID IT BEGIN TO BE HIS WAS IT WHEN HE SET HIS HEART UPON IT OR WHEN HE GATHERED IT
I WOULD LAY AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR MY MONTERO CAP TO A SHILLING WAS IT PROPER CONTINUED TRIM MAKING A BOW TO OFFER A WAGER BEFORE YOUR HONOURS THERE IS NOTHING IMPROPER IN IT SAID MY FATHER
SHE RAISED HER FINGERS AND LET THEM FALL IT COULD SCARCE BE CALL'D A TAP OR IF IT WAS A TAP
ONCE AT LEAST EVERY FOUR OR FIVE DAYS BUT OFTNER IF CONVENIENT LEST IN TAKING OFF THY WIG BEFORE HER THRO ABSENCE OF MIND SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISCOVER HOW MUCH HAS BEEN CUT AWAY BY TIME HOW MUCH BY TRIM
FOR CERTAINLY KEY HOLES WERE MADE FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND CONSIDERING THE ACT AS AN ACT WHICH INTERFERED WITH A TRUE PROPOSITION AND DENIED A KEY HOLE TO BE WHAT IT WAS
YET I WOULD REMIND THEE OF ONE DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF THY COURTSHIP IN A PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH I WOULD NOT HAVE OMITTED AND THAT IS NEVER TO GO FORTH UPON THE ENTERPRIZE WHETHER IT BE IN THE MORNING OR THE AFTERNOON
THAT THE SWEAT OF A MAN'S BROWS AND THE EXSUDATIONS OF A MAN'S BRAINS ARE AS MUCH A MAN'S OWN PROPERTY AS THE BREECHES UPON HIS BACKSIDE
I MEAN THE EXTERNAL ORGAN OF SMELLING OR THAT PART OF MAN WHICH STANDS PROMINENT IN HIS FACE AND WHICH PAINTERS SAY IN GOOD JOLLY NOSES AND WELL PROPORTIONED FACES SHOULD COMPREHEND A FULL THIRD THAT IS MEASURED DOWNWARDS FROM THE SETTING ON OF THE HAIR
SO THAT MY FATHER HAD THE JOINTURE TO PAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS HALF YEARLY ON MICHAELMAS AND LADY DAY DURING ALL THAT TIME NO MAN DISCHARGED PECUNIARY OBLIGATIONS WITH A BETTER GRACE THAN MY FATHER
THAT HE DID NOT CONCEIVE HOW THE GREATEST FAMILY IN ENGLAND COULD STAND IT OUT AGAINST AN UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESSION OF SIX OR SEVEN SHORT NOSES AND FOR THE CONTRARY REASON HE WOULD GENERALLY ADD
THAT IF TOM HAD NOT MARRIED THE WIDOW OR HAD IT PLEASED GOD AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THAT THEY HAD BUT PUT PORK INTO THEIR SAUSAGES THE HONEST SOUL HAD NEVER BEEN TAKEN OUT OF HIS WARM BED AND DRAGG'D TO THE INQUISITION
OF THE SMALLEST DESCRIPTION INDEED HE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO CALL IT HIS OWN HE MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY RECALCITRANT NOW AND THEN AS IS THE HABIT OF LONG EARED PACHYDERMS UNDER THE THONG OF THE FAIR COUNTESS'S TONGUE
AND NO OBSTACLE IN NATURE TO FORBID THE MUSIC STRIKING UP THIS VERY NIGHT YET WILL I ANSWER FOR IT THAT THIS SELF SAME TUNE WILL NOT BE PLAY'D THIS TWELVEMONTH
NOT INDEED ANY VERY RIPE AND COMPREHENSIVE WISDOM BUT MUCH EXTERNAL POLISH AND CERTAIN PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS OF A VERY DECIDED KIND
SO SHE HAD DETERMINED ON TRYING A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S AFFAIRS AND WHERE THE WOMEN WERE MOSTLY ILL DRESSED AND UGLY
AND FEEL PITY FOR THE FORCE OF EDUCATION AND THE PREVALENCE OF OPINIONS LONG DERIVED FROM ANCESTORS FOR THREE GENERATIONS AT LEAST THIS TENET IN FAVOUR OF LONG NOSES
THEY HAD COST HIM MOREOVER AS MUCH LABOUR IN COOKING AND DIGESTING AS IN THE CASE ABOVE SO THAT THEY MIGHT WELL AND TRULY BE SAID TO BE OF HIS OWN GOODS AND CHATTELS ACCORDINGLY HE HELD FAST BY EM BOTH BY TEETH AND CLAWS
BY THE TROTTING OF MY LEAN HORSE THE THING IS INCREDIBLE AND I AM QUITE LOST IN MY UNDERSTANDING WHEN I AM CONSIDERING WHAT A TREASURE OF PRECIOUS TIME AND TALENTS TOGETHER HAS BEEN WASTED UPON WORSE SUBJECTS
AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN'S FIRST NUPTIALS MIGHT OCCUR BEFORE THE COUNTESS WAS QUITE SURE OF HER SECOND AS IT WAS HOWEVER HE SUBMITTED TO ALL HIS SISTER'S CAPRICES
A WHIFF OF MILITARY PRIDE HAD PUFF'D OUT HIS SHIRT AT THE WRIST AND UPON THAT IN A BLACK LEATHER THONG CLIPP'D INTO A TASSEL BEYOND THE KNOT HUNG THE CORPORAL'S STICK MY UNCLE TOBY CARRIED HIS CANE
THE COUNTESS DID NOT QUOTE SOPHOCLES BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF ONLY THIS LITTLE BIT OF PRETENCE AND VANITY AND THEN I WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND MAKE MYSELF QUITE SAFE FOR ANOTHER WORLD
AS SOON AS EVER HE ENTER'D UPON THE ODD FIFTY HE GENERALLY GAVE A LOUD HEM
MY MOTHER MADAM WAS SO AT NO TIME EITHER BY NATURE BY INSTITUTION OR EXAMPLE A TEMPERATE CURRENT OF BLOOD RAN ORDERLY THROUGH HER VEINS IN ALL MONTHS OF THE YEAR
FOR THIS REASON CONTINUED MY FATHER STATING THE CASE OVER AGAIN NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE WORLD KNOWS THAT MISSUS WADMAN AFFECTS MY BROTHER TOBY AND MY BROTHER TOBY CONTRARIWISE AFFECTS MISSUS WADMAN
MISSUS SHANDY BEING NOW CLOSE BESIDE ME PREPARING FOR BED I HAVE THROWN TOGETHER WITHOUT ORDER AND JUST AS THEY HAVE COME INTO MY MIND SUCH HINTS AND DOCUMENTS AS I DEEM MAY BE OF USE TO THEE
SAID MY UNCLE TOBY MUSING WHILST A MAN IS FREE CRIED THE CORPORAL GIVING A FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK THUS
AND PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL FOR THEE THO NOT SO WELL FOR ME THAT THOU HAST OCCASION FOR A LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS UPON THAT HEAD AND THAT I AM ABLE TO WRITE IT TO THEE HAD IT BEEN THE GOOD PLEASURE OF HIM WHO DISPOSES OF OUR LOTS
AND WITH HIS HAIR TUCK'D UP UNDER HIS MONTERO CAP WHICH HE HAD FURBISH'D UP FOR THE OCCASION
THUS THERE WAS REALLY NOT MUCH AFFECTATION IN HER SWEET SPEECHES AND ATTENTIONS TO MISTER AND MISSUS BARTON
BESIDES THINK OF ALL THE VIRTUOUS DECLAMATION ALL THE PENETRATING OBSERVATION WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT UP ENTIRELY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION THAT THE COUNTESS WAS A VERY OBJECTIONABLE PERSON INDEED
INSERTED HIS HAND CAUTIOUSLY BETWIXT HIS HEAD AND THE CAWL OF HIS WIG LOOK'D AT BOTH SIDES OF EVERY GUINEA AS HE PARTED WITH IT AND SELDOM COULD GET TO THE END OF THE FIFTY POUNDS WITHOUT PULLING OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPING HIS TEMPLES
THEY ARE AS ROTTEN AS DIRT SAID THE CORPORAL THEN BY ALL MEANS SAID MY FATHER BESPEAK A NEW PAIR BROTHER FOR THOUGH I KNOW CONTINUED MY FATHER TURNING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY
BROTHER DIDIUS TRIBONIUS WILL ANSWER NOW TRIBONIUS THE CIVILIAN AND CHURCH LAWYER'S BEARD BEING THREE INCHES AND A HALF AND THREE EIGHTHS LONGER THAN DIDIUS HIS BEARD
WOULD FLY TO WHATEVER HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON AND IN A WORD WOULD INTRENCH AND FORTIFY THEM ROUND WITH AS MANY CIRCUMVALLATIONS AND BREAST WORKS AS MY UNCLE TOBY WOULD A CITADEL
THAT WIDOW WADMAN AN PLEASE YOUR WORSHIP CANNOT HOLD IT OUT TEN DAYS AND WHENCE CRIED SLOP JEERINGLY HAST THOU ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE OF WOMAN FRIEND
DEVOUREDST NO MAN'S BREAD GENTLY WITH FAITHFUL TRIM BEHIND THEE DIDST THOU AMBLE ROUND THE LITTLE CIRCLE OF THY PLEASURES JOSTLING NO CREATURE IN THY WAY FOR EACH ONE'S SORROWS THOU HADST A TEAR
BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A POPISH CLERGY WOMAN SAID TRIM TWAS A BEGUINE SAID MY UNCLE TOBY DOCTOR SLOP WAS TOO MUCH IN WRATH TO LISTEN TO THE DISTINCTION
CHAPTER FOUR I AM BY NO MEANS SURE THAT IF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF MILBY HAD KNOWN THE TRUTH ABOUT THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT WAS VERY FAR FROM BEING AS BAD AS THEY IMAGINED
HAD NO COMPENSATING SUPERIORITY IN VIRTUE TO SET AGAINST THE OTHER LADY'S MANIFEST SUPERIORITY IN PERSONAL CHARMS MISS PHIPPS'S STUMPY FIGURE AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTIRE
INTO A CORPS NO MATTER WHETHER HE LOVES THE SERVICE OR NO BEING ONCE IN IT HE ACTS AS IF HE DID AND TAKES EVERY STEP TO SHEW HIMSELF A MAN OF PROWESSE
WHETHER TWAS A TAP OF REMONSTRANCE OR A TAP OF CONFESSION MY FATHER WHO WAS ALL SENSIBILITIES FROM HEAD TO FOOT
WE HAVE TAKEN OUR MEASURES BADLY QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING UP INTERROGATIVELY IN TRIM'S FACE I WOULD LAY MY MONTERO CAP SAID TRIM
FOR THAT THE TAYLOR IN RIPPING THEM UP IN ORDER TO TURN THEM HAD FOUND THEY HAD BEEN TURN'D BEFORE THEN TURN THEM AGAIN BROTHER SAID MY FATHER RAPIDLY FOR THERE WILL BE MANY A TURNING OF EM YET BEFORE ALL'S DONE IN THE AFFAIR
AND FOLD THE PAPER ONCE OR TWICE OVER WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN FOR INSTANCE BROTHER SAMUEL WILL YOU COMMUNICATE WITH ME THROUGH THIS MEDIUM WILLIAM FRANKLIN TO LEARN WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN THE MEDIUM LAYS THE PAPER DOWN ON THE TABLE
WITH JUST WATER ENOUGH TO COVER IT AS IT HARDENS BY FURIOUS BOILING
WHEN IT OUGHT TO BE YOUR FATHER JOHN THE REASON HE DID NOT DESIRE INQUIRERS TO WRITE THE SURNAMES OF THEIR SPIRIT FRIENDS WAS THIS ALMOST ALL CHRISTIAN NAMES ARE COMMON AND HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE MOTIONS WHICH THE HAND MUST MAKE IN WRITING THEM
DROPPING THAT AND TAKING ANOTHER ON THIS SO HE HANDLES ALL THE PAPERS WITHOUT GETTING A RESPONSE DURING THIS TIME HOWEVER HE HAS DEXTEROUSLY PALMED ONE OF THE BALLOTS WHICH WHILE TELLING THE INVESTIGATOR TO BE PATIENT
THE DISH SHOULD BE VERY HOT ON WHICH BROILED MEAT IS PUT AND IT SHOULD NOT BE SEASONED TILL TAKEN UP IF YOU WISH TO FRY MEAT CUT A SMALL PIECE OF PORK INTO SLICES AND FRY THEM A LIGHT BROWN THEN TAKE THEM UP AND PUT IN YOUR MEAT WHICH SHOULD BE PERFECTLY DRY
THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE MEDIUM TO READ THE QUESTION THROUGH THE TWO FOLDS OF PAPER THE ANSWER IS WRITTEN UPON THE SAME STRIP OF PAPER THAT ACCOMPANIES THE QUESTION THE MEDIUM REQUIRES THE INVESTIGATOR TO WRITE HIS QUESTIONS EACH ON A DIFFERENT STRIP OF PAPER AND BEFORE ANSWERING
IN ORDER TO HAVE THE FAT RISE AND SKIMMED OFF IF YOU WISH TO HAVE YOUR CALF'S HEAD LOOK BROWN TAKE IT UP WHEN TENDER RUB A LITTLE BUTTER OVER IT SPRINKLE ON SALT PEPPER AND ALLSPICE SPRINKLE FLOUR OVER IT AND PUT BEFORE THE FIRE WITH A DUTCH OVEN OVER IT
THEY ARE PREPARED LIKE THE BRAINS THE LIQUOR THAT THE CALF'S HEAD IS BOILED IN MAKES A GOOD SOUP SEASONED IN A PLAIN WAY LIKE ANY OTHER VEAL SOUP OR SEASONED TURTLE FASHION THE LIQUOR SHOULD STAND UNTIL THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE HEAD IS BOILED
THESE PIECES ARE GOOD STUFFED LIKE A FILLET OF VEAL AND ROASTED THE LEG IS ALSO GOOD COOKED IN THE SAME MANNER BUT IT IS BETTER BOILED WITH A POUND OF SALT PORK ALLOW FIFTEEN MINUTES BOILING TO EACH POUND OF MEAT
NO BOILING IS NECESSARY PUT THE BEEF IN THE BRINE AS LONG AS ANY SALT REMAINS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CASK IT IS STRONG ENOUGH WHENEVER ANY SCUM RISES THE BRINE SHOULD BE SCALDED SKIMMED AND MORE SUGAR SALT AND SALT PETRE ADDED
STIR IT INTO THE FAT PUT THE PAN BACK ON THE FIRE STIR IT TILL IT BOILS UP THEN TURN IT OVER THE BEEF FOUR ALAMODE BEEF THE ROUND OF BEEF IS THE BEST PIECE TO ALAMODE
THE NECK OF MUTTON MAKES A GOOD SOUP PARSELY OR CELERY HEADS ARE A PRETTY GARNISH FOR MUTTON EIGHT VEAL THE LOIN OF VEAL IS THE BEST PIECE FOR ROASTING THE BREAST AND RACK ARE GOOD ROASTED
PUT THE REMAINDER OF THE DRESSING ON TOP OF THE MEAT AND COVER IT WITH A HEATED BAKE PAN LID FOR SIX POUNDS OF VEAL ALLOW TWO HOURS STEADY BAKING A LEG OF VEAL IS NICE PREPARED IN THIS MANNER AND ROASTED SEVENTEEN
AND PERHAPS ONE OF THEM WILL BE DESIGNATED THIS TIME DROPPING AMONG THE REST THE ONE HE HAD PALMED HE SOON PICKS IT UP AGAIN WHEREAT THREE LOUD RAPS ARE HEARD THAT PAPER SAYS HE TO THE INVESTIGATOR
THEREFORE IF THE MEDIUM SELECTED THE FIRST THAT WAS WRITTEN OF EACH CLASS THEY IN MOST CASES REFERRED TO THE SAME SPIRIT HE WAITED TILL THE INVESTIGATOR HAD AFFIRMED THE COINCIDENCE BEFORE PROCEEDING
OF SEVERAL OF HIS DECEASED RELATIVES WHICH BEING DONE HE WAS DESIRED TO TOUCH THE FOLDED PAPERS ONE AFTER THE OTHER TILL ONE SHOULD BE DESIGNATED BY THREE TIPS OF THE TABLE AS CONTAINING THE NAME OF THE SPIRIT WHO WOULD COMMUNICATE
ONE OF THE MOST NOTED OF THE MEDIUMISTIC FRATERNITY WHOSE NAME I DO NOT CHOOSE TO GIVE AT PRESENT STEADILY PURSUED HIS BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROOM IN BROADWAY IN THIS CITY AND SUCCEEDED NOT ONLY IN HUMBUGGING A GOOD MANY PEOPLE
ONLY BY MEANS OF THE ODYLIC MAGNETIC OR SOME OTHER EMANATION FROM THE ENDS OF HIS FINGERS HAVING LEARNED THE QUESTION OF COURSE THE MEDIUM CAN REPLY TO IT GIVING THE NAME OF THE SPIRIT ADDRESSED BUT BEFORE DOING SO
SIX TO CORN BEEF TO EVERY GALLON OF COLD WATER PUT A QUART OF ROCK SALT AN OUNCE OF SALT PETRE QUARTER OF A POUND OF BROWN SUGAR
HE HANDS THE INVESTIGATOR A STRIP OF BLANK WHITE PAPER RATHER THIN AND LIGHT OF TEXTURE ABOUT A YARD LONG AND SIX INCHES WIDE REQUESTING HIM TO WRITE ACROSS ONE END OF IT A SINGLE QUESTION ADDRESSED TO A SPIRIT FRIEND THEN TO SIGN HIS OWN NAME
INTERPOSING THEIR LEFT HAND BETWEEN THE PAPER ON WHICH THEY WROTE AND THE MEDIUM'S EYES AND THEY WERE VERY MUCH ASTONISHED WHEN THEY RECEIVED A COMMUNICATION COUCHED IN AFFECTIONATE TERMS WITH THE NAMES OF THEIR SPIRIT FRIENDS ATTACHED
STEW IT GENTLY TILL THE RICE IS TENDER AND THE WATER NEARLY STEWED AWAY A LITTLE CURRY POWDER IN THIS CONVERTS IT INTO A CURRY DISH SIXTEEN A FILLET OF VEAL CUT OFF THE SHANK OF A LEG OF VEAL AND CUT GASHES IN THE REMAINDER
WHEN A PIECE OF BEEF IS PUT IN THE BRINE RUB A LITTLE SALT OVER IT IF THE WEATHER IS HOT CUT A GASH TO THE BONE OF THE MEAT AND FILL IT WITH SALT PUT A HEAVY WEIGHT ON THE BEEF IN ORDER TO KEEP IT UNDER THE BRINE
IN VERY HOT WEATHER IT IS DIFFICULT TO CORN BEEF IN COLD BRINE BEFORE IT SPOILS ON THIS ACCOUNT IT IS GOOD TO CORN IT IN THE POT WHEN BOILED IT IS DONE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
THE OLD GENTLEMAN CAREFULLY ADJUSTED HIS SPECS AND DID WHAT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM A NAME AND RELATIONSHIP HAVING BEEN SELECTED FROM THOSE WRITTEN THE INVESTIGATOR WAS DESIRED TO EXAMINE AND STATE IF THEY REFERRED TO ONE PARTY
BOIL A PIECE OF LEAN VEAL TILL TENDER TAKE IT UP CUT IT INTO STRIPS THREE OR FOUR INCHES LONG PUT IT BACK INTO THE POT WITH THE LIQUOR IT WAS BOILED IN WITH A TEA CUP OF RICE TO THREE POUNDS OF VEAL PUT IN A PIECE OF BUTTER OF THE SIZE OF A HEN'S EGG
ABOUT AN INCH THICK CUT FROM THE LEG WHEN BROWN ON BOTH SIDES TAKE THEM UP STIR HALF A PINT OF WATER INTO THE GRAVY
PROBABLY CONTAINS THE NAME OF THE SPIRIT WHO RAPPED PLEASE HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND THEN SEIZING A PENCIL HE WRITES A NAME WHICH THE INVESTIGATOR FINDS TO BE THE ONE CONTAINED IN THE SELECTED PAPER IF THE BALLOTS ARE FEW IN NUMBER A BLANK IS PUT WITH THE PILE
THE SELECTED PAPER WAS LAID ASIDE AND THE OTHERS THROWN UPON THE FLOOR THE INVESTIGATOR BEING FURTHER REQUESTED TO WRITE ON AS MANY DIFFERENT PIECES OF PAPER AS CONTAINED THE NAMES AND THE RELATION TO HIMSELF OF THE SPIRITS BEARING THEM
BUT THE BEST WAY TO COOK IT IS TO BROIL IT TEN MINUTES WITH FOUR OR FIVE SLICES OF SALT PORK THEN TAKE IT CUT IT INTO SMALL STRIPS TOGETHER WITH THE PORK
OR FORCE MEAT BALLS ELEVEN FORCE MEAT BALLS CHOP A POUND OR TWO OF VEAL FINE MIX IT WITH ONE OR TWO EGGS A LITTLE BUTTER OR RAW PORK CHOPPED FINE SEASON IT WITH SALT AND PEPPER OR CURRY POWDER
BY LONG PRACTICE THE MEDIUM WAS ENABLED TO DETERMINE WHAT THE INVESTIGATOR WROTE BY THE MOTION OF HIS HAND IN WRITING NINE OUT OF TEN WROTE THE RELATIONSHIP FIRST THAT CORRESPONDED WITH THE FIRST NAME THEY HAD WRITTEN
WHEN THE MEDIUM PALMS ONE ELSE THE LATTER MIGHT BE MISSED IT SEEMS THE SPIRITS CAN NEVER GIVE THEIR NAMES WITHOUT BEING REMINDED OF THEM BY THE INVESTIGATOR AND THEN THEY ARE SO DOUBTFUL OF THEIR OWN IDENTITY THAT THEY HAVE BUT LITTLE TO SAY FOR THEMSELVES
IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED EACH BONE BY ITSELF BROILED QUICK AND BUTTERED SALTED AND PEPPERED THE BREAST OF MUTTON IS NICE BAKED THE JOINTS OF THE BRISKET SHOULD BE SEPARATED THE SHARP ENDS OF THE RIBS SAWED OFF THE OUTSIDE RUBBED OVER WITH A LITTLE PIECE OF BUTTER
THE BONE SHOULD BE CUT OUT AND THE PLACE FILLED WITH A DRESSING MADE OF BREAD SOAKED SOFT IN COLD WATER A LITTLE SALT PEPPER A COUPLE OF EGGS AND A TABLE SPOONFUL OF MELTED BUTTER PUT IN THEN SEW IT UP PUT IT IN YOUR BAKE PAN WITH ABOUT A PINT OF WATER
WHEN THE MEAT IS PUT TO THE FIRE A LITTLE SALT SHOULD BE SPRINKLED ON IT AND THE BONY SIDE TURNED TOWARDS THE FIRE FIRST WHEN THE BONES GET WELL HEATED THROUGH TURN THE MEAT AND KEEP A BRISK FIRE BASTE IT FREQUENTLY WHILE ROASTING
WHICH READ SOMEWHAT AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR HUSBAND I AM VERY GLAD TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS YOU THROUGH THIS CHANNEL KEEP ON INVESTIGATING AND YOU WILL SOON BE CONVINCED OF THE GREAT FACT OF SPIRIT INTERCOURSE I AM HAPPY IN MY SPIRIT HOME
BUT THERE ARE COMPARATIVELY FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME SURNAMES AND TO DETERMINE THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT NO FACT WAS COMMUNICATED THAT HAD NOT BEEN SURREPTITIOUSLY GLEANED FROM THE INVESTIGATOR
PATIENTLY AWAITING THE TIME WHEN YOU WILL JOIN ME HERE ET CETERA YOUR LOVING WIFE BETSEY
AND ONE OF THEM DESIGNATED BY THREE TIPS OF THE TABLE AS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE RESPECTIVE AGES OF THE DECEASED PARTIES AT THE TIME OF THEIR DECEASE WOULD ALSO BE WRITTEN AND ONE OF THEM SELECTED THE FIRST TEST CONSISTED IN HAVING THE SELECTED NAME
HE FURNISHES WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS TO PARTIES VISITING HIM AT HIS ROOMS A SITTING HOWEVER BEING GRANTED TO BUT ONE PERSON AT A TIME HIS TERMS ARE ONLY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR SEATED AT A TABLE IN A PART OF THE ROOM WHERE IS THE MOST LIGHT
IN ORDER TO BECOME A SPIRIT MEDIUM OR AT LEAST TO GAIN THE REPUTATION OF BEING ONE BACKING UP THE PRETENCE TO MEDIUMSHIP WITH A SHOW OF SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS IS ALL SUFFICIENT TO ENLIST ATTENTION AND INSURE THE MAKING OF CONVERTS
PUT IN A PIECE OF BUTTER OF THE SIZE OF A HEN'S EGG HALF A TEA SPOONFUL OF SALT THE SAME QUANTITY OF GROUND CLOVES ALLSPICE AND PEPPER HALF A NUTMEG A COUPLE OF EGGS AND A TABLE SPOONFUL OF FLOUR MIX THE WHOLE WELL TOGETHER
ONE OBSERVATIONS RESPECTING MEAT MEAT TO BE IN PERFECTION SHOULD BE KEPT A NUMBER OF DAYS WHEN THE WEATHER WILL ADMIT OF IT BEEF AND MUTTON SHOULD BE KEPT AT LEAST A WEEK IN COLD WEATHER AND POULTRY THREE OR FOUR DAYS
THEN COVER IT WITH A DRESSING MADE OF BREAD SOAKED SOFT A LITTLE BUTTER AN EGG AND SEASON IT WITH SALT PEPPER AND POWDERED MACE SLICE UP THE BRAINS AND LAY THEM IN THE PAN WITH THE HEAD BAKE IT IN A QUICK OVEN AND GARNISH IT WITH SLICES OF LEMON
HE DOUBLES THE TWO FOLDS MADE BY THE INQUIRER AND FOR A SHOW OF CONSISTENCY AGAIN RUBS HIS FINGERS OVER THE PAPER THEN MORE FOLDS AND MORE RUBBING ALL THE FOLDING ADDITIONAL TO THE INQUIRER'S BEING DONE TO KEEP THE LATTER FROM OBSERVING WHEN HE COMES TO READ THE ANSWER
IF YOU HAVE ANY BATTER LEFT IT IS NICE DROPPED BY THE LARGE SPOONFUL INTO THE FAT AND FRIED TILL BROWN THEN LAID OVER THE VEAL THICKEN THE GRAVY AND TURN IT OVER THE WHOLE IT TAKES ABOUT AN HOUR TO COOK THIS DISH
PUT IN A SMALL PIECE OF BUTTER AND A LITTLE WINE AND CATSUP IF YOU LIKE THE GRAVY RICH NINE VEAL CUTLETS FRY THREE OR FOUR SLICES OF PORK UNTIL BROWN
IF NOT RICH ENOUGH ADD BUTTER AND CATSUP IF YOU LIKE TWO ROAST BEEF THE TENDER LOIN AND FIRST AND SECOND CUTS OFF THE RACK ARE THE BEST ROASTING PIECES THE THIRD AND FOURTH CUTS ARE GOOD
THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE WATER PUT INTO THE DRIPPING PAN WHEN THE MEAT IS PUT DOWN TO ROAST IF IT IS A THICK PIECE ALLOW FIFTEEN MINUTES TO EACH POUND TO ROAST IT IN IF THIN LESS TIME WILL BE REQUIRED THREE BEEF STEAK
BUT NOT LOST AS THE JUICES MAKE GOOD GRAVY AND THE FAT IS GOOD FOR VARIOUS CULINARY PURPOSES WHEN IT IS PUT DOWN TO ROAST THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE WATER IN THE DRIPPING PAN FOR BROILING THE BARS OF THE GRIDIRON SHOULD BE PERFECTLY CLEAN AND GREASED WITH LARD OR BUTTER
WHEN THE MEAT IS SUFFICIENTLY FRIED TAKE IT UP REMOVE THE FRYING PAN FROM THE FIRE TO COOL WHEN SO TURN IN A LITTLE COLD WATER FOR THE GRAVY PUT IT ON THE FIRE WHEN IT BOILS STIR IN A LITTLE MIXED FLOUR AND WATER LET IT BOIL THEN TURN IT OVER THE MEAT
AND FRY THEM BROWN IF YOU WISH FOR GRAVY FOR THEM WHEN YOU HAVE TAKEN THEM UP STIR A LITTLE FLOUR INTO THE FAT THEY WERE FRIED IN SEASON IT WITH SALT PEPPER AND MACE ADD A LITTLE BUTTER AND WINE IF YOU LIKE THEN TURN IT OVER THE FEET THIRTEEN
WHEN MEAT IS FROZEN IT SHOULD BE PUT INTO LUKEWARM WATER AND NOT TAKEN OUT TILL THE FROST IS EXTRACTED IF THERE IS ANY FROST IN IT WHEN PUT TO THE FIRE IT WILL NOT COOK WELL THE BEST WAY TO BOIL IT IS TO PUT IT IN COLD WATER AND BOIL IT GENTLY
CUT UP ABOUT A QUARTER OF A POUND OF BUTTER HEAT THE PLATTER VERY HOT THAT THE STEAK IS TO BE PUT ON LAY THE BUTTER ON IT TAKE UP THE STEAK SALT AND PEPPER IT ON BOTH SIDES BEEF STEAK TO BE GOOD SHOULD BE EATEN AS SOON AS COOKED
TAKE THE PAN OFF FROM THE FIRE TO LET THE FAT COOL WHEN COOL TURN IN HALF A TEA CUP OF WATER
OR IN A BRICK OVEN WHERE IT WILL BROWN QUICK WARM UP THE BRAINS WITH A LITTLE WATER BUTTER SALT AND PEPPER ADD WINE AND SPICES IF YOU LIKE SERVE IT UP AS A DRESSING FOR THE HEAD CALF'S HEAD IS ALSO GOOD BAKED HALVE IT
PRESSED AGAINST THE EDGE BY PUSHING THE TABLE TIPPED FROM HIM IT BEING PREVENTED FROM SLIDING BY LITTLE SPIKES IN THE LEGS OF THE SIDE OPPOSITE THE OPERATOR THERE ARE OTHER BALLOT TEST MEDIUMS AS THEY ARE CALLED WHO HAVE A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT METHOD OF CHEATING
THE SHOULDER CLOD IS GOOD AND COMES LOWER IT IS ALSO GOOD STEWED WITHOUT ANY SPICES FOR FIVE POUNDS OF BEEF SOAK ABOUT A POUND OF BREAD IN COLD WATER TILL SOFT THEN DRAIN OFF THE WATER MASH THE BREAD FINE
VEAL FOR ROASTING SHOULD BE SALTED PEPPERED AND A LITTLE BUTTER RUBBED ON IT AND BASTED FREQUENTLY PUT A LITTLE WATER IN THE DRIPPING PAN AND UNLESS THE MEAT IS QUITE FAT A LITTLE BUTTER SHOULD BE PUT IN THE FILLET IS GOOD BAKED
THE MEDIUM LIKE MANY OTHERS INCORRECTLY PRONOUNCED THE TERM DECEASED
AS THE SCUM THAT RISES IS APT TO MAKE THE MEAT LOOK DARK THE SCUM SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF AS SOON AS IT RISES THE LIQUOR IN WHICH ALL KINDS OF FRESH MEAT IS BOILED MAKES A GOOD SOUP WHEN THICKENED AND SEASONED BOILING IS THE CHEAPEST WAY OF COOKING MEAT
THE TENDER LOIN IS THE BEST PIECE FOR BROILING A STEAK FROM THE ROUND OR SHOULDER CLOD IS GOOD AND COMES CHEAPER IF THE BEEF IS NOT VERY TENDER IT SHOULD BE LAID ON A BOARD AND POUNDED BEFORE BROILING OR FRYING IT
SALT IT AND PUT IT IN A BAKE PAN WITH A PINT OF WATER WHEN DONE TAKE IT UP AND THICKEN THE GRAVY WITH A LITTLE FLOUR AND WATER AND PUT IN A SMALL PIECE OF BUTTER A TABLE SPOONFUL OF CATSUP CLOVES AND ALLSPICE IMPROVE IT BUT ARE NOT ESSENTIAL
AN OLD GENTLEMAN APPARENTLY FROM THE COUNTRY ONE DAY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THIS MEDIUM AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE FOR A SPERIT COMMUNICATION HE WAS TOLD TO TAKE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND TO WRITE THE NAMES OF HIS DECEASED RELATIVES
TO SIX OR EIGHT POUNDS OF BEEF PUT A TEA CUP OF SALT SPRINKLE FLOUR ON THE SIDE THAT IS TO GO UP ON THE TABLE AND PUT IT DOWN IN THE POT TURN THE WATER INTO THE POT AFTER THE BEEF IS PUT IN BOIL IT A COUPLE OF HOURS THEN TURN IN MORE COLD WATER AND BOIL IT AN HOUR AND A HALF LONGER
AS THE SPIRITS WOULD DOUBTLESS SOON COME HE OPENS WITH HIS LEFT HAND ON HIS KNEE UNDER THE EDGE OF THE TABLE A MERE GLANCE ENABLES HIM TO READ THE NAME REFOLDING THE PAPER AND RETAINING IT IN HIS HAND HE REMARKS I WILL TOUCH THE BALLOTS AGAIN
IF THE MEAT IS TOUGH IT WILL BE BETTER TO STEW IT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE FRYING IT TEN CALF'S HEAD BOIL THE HEAD TWO HOURS TOGETHER WITH THE LIGHTS AND FEET PUT IN THE LIVER WHEN IT HAS BOILED AN HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES
AND FLOUR ENOUGH TO RENDER IT THICK WHEN THE VEAL IS FRIED BROWN DIP IT INTO THE BATTER THEN PUT IT BACK INTO THE FAT AND FRY IT UNTIL BROWN AGAIN
A PINT OF WATER WITH A LITTLE BUTTER SHOULD BE PUT IN THE PAN THE LEG IS ALSO GOOD CUT INTO SLICES AND BROILED IT IS GOOD CORNED A FEW DAYS AND THEN BOILED THE RACK IS GOOD FOR BROILING
RELATIONSHIP AND AGE CORRESPOND THAT IS REFER TO THE SAME PARTY TO ASCERTAIN WHICH THE INVESTIGATOR WAS DESIRED TO LOOK AT THEM AND STATE IF IT WAS THE CASE IF THE CORRESPONDENCE WAS AFFIRMED A COMMUNICATION WAS SOON GIVEN
BEFORE THE HEAD IS DONE TIE THE BRAINS IN A BAG AND BOIL THEM WITH IT WHEN THE BRAINS ARE DONE TAKE THEM UP SEASON THEM WITH SALT PEPPER BUTTER AND SWEET HERBS OR SPICES IF YOU LIKE USE THIS AS A DRESSING FOR THE HEAD SOME PEOPLE PREFER PART OF THE LIVER AND FEET FOR DRESSING
THE LATTER WAS HANDED SEVERAL SLIPS OF BLANK PAPER
PROVIDED YOU MAKE A SOUP OF THE LIQUOR IF NOT IT IS THE DEAREST AS MOST OF THE GELATINE IS EXTRACTED BY THE PROCESS OF BOILING WHICH IS THE MOST NOURISHING PART AND IF NOT USED FOR SOUP IS COMPLETELY LOST IN ROASTING MEAT ONLY THE JUICES AND FAT ARE EXTRACTED
FOR BOILING OR ROASTING MUTTON ALLOW A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO EACH POUND OF MEAT THE LEG IS GOOD CUT IN GASHES AND FILLED WITH A DRESSING AND BAKED THE DRESSING IS MADE OF SOAKED BREAD A LITTLE BUTTER SALT AND PEPPER AND A COUPLE OF EGGS
THE BREAST OF LAMB IS GOOD ROASTED BROILED OR CORNED AND BOILED IT IS ALSO GOOD MADE INTO A POT PIE THE FORE QUARTER WITH THE RIBS DIVIDED IS GOOD BROILED THE BONES OF THIS AS WELL AS ALL KINDS OF MEAT
THE BREAST ALSO IS GOOD MADE INTO A POT PIE AND THE RACK CUT INTO SMALL PIECES AND BROILED THE LEG IS NICE FOR FRYING AND WHEN SEVERAL SLICES HAVE BEEN CUT OFF FOR CUTLETS THE REMAINDER IS NICE BOILED WITH A SMALL PIECE OF SALT PORK
BUT IN WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO HIM ACQUIRING QUITE AN AMOUNT OF MONEY HIS MODE OF OPERATING WAS THE BALLOT TEST AND WAS AS FOLLOWS MEDIUM AND INVESTIGATOR BEING SEATED OPPOSITE EACH OTHER AT A TABLE
SOAK A COUPLE OF SLICES OF TOASTED BREAD IN THE GRAVY LAY THEM ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PLATTER PLACE THE MEAT AND PORK OVER IT THEN TURN ON THE GRAVY A VERY NICE WAY TO COOK THE CUTLETS IS TO MAKE A BATTER WITH HALF A PINT OF MILK
ARE YOU HAPPY BEING A QUESTION COMMONLY ASKED THE SPIRITS ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN VARIED IT BY ASKING ARE YOU HUNGRY THE REPLY WAS AN EMPHATIC AFFIRMATIVE THEY TRICKED THE TRICKSTER IN OTHER WAYS ONE OF WHICH WAS TO WRITE THE NAMES OF MORTALS INSTEAD OF SPIRITS
HE EVERY TIME MANIPULATES THE PAPER IN THE WAY I HAVE DESCRIBED WHEN RUBBING HIS FINGERS OVER THE QUESTION HE OFTEN SHUTS THE EYE WHICH IS TOWARD THE INQUIRER WHICH PREVENTS SUSPICION BUT THE OTHER EYE IS OPEN WIDE ENOUGH TO ENABLE HIM TO READ THE QUESTION THROUGH THE PAPER
MADE BY THE INQUIRER IF THAT DOES NOT RENDER THE WRITING VISIBLE THROUGH THE ONE THICKNESS OF PAPER THAT COVERS IT HE SLIGHTLY RAISES THE EDGE OF THE FOLDS WITH HIS LEFT HAND WHILE HE CONTINUES TO RUB WITH HIS RIGHT AND THAT ADMITS OF THE LIGHT SHINING THROUGH SO THAT THE WRITING CAN BE READ
WHEN IT HAS STEWED A COUPLE OF HOURS TURN THE RESERVED DRESSING ON TOP OF THE MEAT HEAT THE BAKE PAN LID HOT ENOUGH TO BROWN THE DRESSING STEW IT AN HOUR AND A HALF LONGER AFTER THE MEAT IS TAKEN UP IF THE GRAVY IS NOT THICK ENOUGH
SUPPOSING THE NAMES WRITTEN WERE MARY JOSEPH AND SAMUEL BEING RESPECTIVELY THE INVESTIGATOR'S MOTHER FATHER AND BROTHER THE LAST NAMED CLASS WOULD BE SECONDLY WRITTEN
DISEASED RETURNED THE OLD MAN WAL SHE AIN'T ANYTHING ELSE FOR SHE'S HAD THE RUMATIZ ORFULLY FOR SIX MONTHS SAYING WHICH HE TOOK HIS HAT AND LEFT CONCLUDING THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH WHILE TO KEEP ON INVESTIGATING ANY LONGER AT THAT TIME
IF THE WEATHER IS HOT IT WILL KEEP BUT A SHORT TIME IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN A COOL AIRY PLACE AWAY FROM THE FLIES AND IF THERE IS ANY DANGER OF ITS SPOILING A LITTLE SALT SHOULD BE RUBBED OVER IT
THIS SAME MEDIUM NOT LONG SINCE VISITED GREAT BRITAIN FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRACTICING HIS PROFESSION THERE IN ONE OF THE CITIES OF SCOTLAND SOME SHREWD INVESTIGATOR DIVINED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO NEARLY GUESS FROM THE MOTION OF THE HAND WHAT QUESTIONS WERE WRITTEN
LAMB THE FORE AND HIND QUARTERS ARE GOOD ROASTING PIECES SPRINKLE SALT AND PEPPER ON THE LAMB TURN THE BONY SIDE TOWARDS THE FIRE FIRST IF NOT FAT RUB A LITTLE BUTTER ON IT AND PUT A LITTLE IN THE DRIPPING PAN BASTE IT FREQUENTLY
THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS DISEASED RELATIVES A HUNGRY SPIRIT PALMING A BALLOT REVELATIONS ON STRIPS OF PAPER AN APTITUDE FOR DECEPTION IS ALL THE CAPITAL THAT A PERSON REQUIRES
ONE MEDIUM TO WHOM I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED AFTER A SOJOURN OF SEVERAL YEARS IN CALIFORNIA WHITHER HE WENT FROM BOSTON SEEKING WHOM HE MIGHT HUMBUG HAS NOW RETURNED TO THE EAST AND IS OPERATING IN THIS CITY BESIDES ANSWERING SEALED LETTERS
TAKE UP THE MEAT THICKEN THE GRAVY WITH FLOUR AND WATER MIXED SMOOTHLY TOGETHER SQUEEZE IN THE JUICE OF HALF A LEMON THEN TURN IT OVER THE COLLOPS GARNISH THEM WITH A LEMON CUT IN THIN SLICES FIFTEEN PLAW
THE OTHER PARTY IS SO SITUATED THAT THE WRITING IS NOT VISIBLE TO HIM THROUGH THE PAPER AND HE IS NOT LIKELY TO PRESUME THAT IT IS VISIBLE TO THE MEDIUM THE LATTER HAVING ASSIGNED AS A REASON FOR HIS MANIPULATIONS THAT SPIRITS WERE ABLE TO READ THE QUESTIONS
CALF'S LIVER AND HEART ARE GOOD BROILED OR FRIED SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE LIVER STUFFED AND BAKED FOURTEEN COLLOPS CUT PART OF A LEG OF VEAL INTO PIECES THREE OR FOUR INCHES BROAD
WHEN PUT DOWN TO BROIL SHOULD FIRST BE PUT TOWARDS THE FIRE AND BROWNED BEFORE THE OTHER SIDE IS BROILED A LITTLE SALT PEPPER AND BUTTER SHOULD BE PUT ON IT WHEN YOU TAKE IT UP
THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE A TROUGH TO CATCH THE JUICES OF THE MEAT WHEN BROILED THE SAME PIECES THAT ARE GOOD BROILED ARE GOOD FOR FRYING FRY A FEW SLICES OF SALT PORK BROWN THEN TAKE THEM UP AND PUT IN THE BEEF WHEN BROWN ON BOTH SIDES TAKE IT UP
MUTTON FOR ROASTING SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE BUTTER RUBBED ON IT AND A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER SPRINKLED ON IT SOME PEOPLE LIKE CLOVES AND ALLSPICE PUT A SMALL PIECE OF BUTTER IN THE DRIPPING PAN AND BASTE IT FREQUENTLY THE BONY SIDE SHOULD BE TURNED TOWARDS THE FIRE FIRST AND ROASTED
MIX A TEA SPOONFUL OR TWO OF FLOUR WITH A LITTLE WATER AND STIR IT INTO THE GRAVY PUT IN A LITTLE BUTTER A WINE GLASS OF WINE AND TURN IT OVER THE MEAT FIVE BEEF LIVER LIVER IS VERY GOOD FRIED
THEY TOO REQUIRE INVESTIGATORS TO WRITE THE NAMES IN FULL HOWEVER OF THEIR SPIRIT FRIENDS THE SLIPS OF PAPER CONTAINING THE NAMES TO BE FOLDED AND PLACED ON A TABLE THE MEDIUM THEN SEIZES ONE OF THE BALLOTS AND ASKS
IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE HOWEVER AS TO GETTING A COMMUNICATION TO TIP THE TABLE WITHOUT APPARENT MUSCULAR EXERTION THIS IMPOSTOR PLACED HIS HANDS ON IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE PISIFORM BONE WHICH MAY BE FELT PROJECTING AT THE LOWER CORNER OF THE PALM OPPOSITE THE THUMB
THEN CUT GASHES IN THE BEEF AND FILL THEM WITH ABOUT HALF OF THE DRESSING PUT THE MEAT IN A BAKE PAN WITH LUKEWARM WATER ENOUGH TO COVER IT SET IT WHERE IT WILL STEW GENTLY FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS COVER IT WITH A HEATED BAKE PAN LID
WAL I DECLARE THEY DO SAID HE BUT I SAY MISTER WHAT HAS THEM PAPERS TO DO WITH A SPERIT COMMUNICATION YOU WILL SEE DIRECTLY REPLIED THE MEDIUM WHEREUPON THE LATTER SPASMODICALLY WROTE A COMMUNICATION
SEVEN MUTTON THE SADDLE IS THE BEST PART TO ROAST THE SHOULDER AND LEG ARE GOOD ROASTED BUT THE BEST MODE TO COOK THE LATTER IS TO BOIL IT WITH A PIECE OF SALT PORK A LITTLE RICE BOILED WITH IT IMPROVES THE LOOKS OF IT
SPRINKLE FLOUR ON THEM FRY THEM IN BUTTER UNTIL BROWN THEN TURN IN WATER ENOUGH TO COVER THE VEAL WHEN IT BOILS TAKE OFF THE SCUM PUT IN TWO OR THREE ONIONS A BLADE OF MACE A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER WHEN STEWED TENDER
MAKE A DRESSING OF BREAD SOAKED SOFT IN COLD WATER AND MASHED SEASON IT WITH SALT PEPPER AND SWEET HERBS CHOP A LITTLE RAW PORK FINE PUT IT IN THE DRESSING AND IF YOU HAVE NOT PORK USE A LITTLE BUTTER INSTEAD FILL THE GASHES IN THE MEAT WITH PART OF THE DRESSING
WITH THE SELECTED NAME RELATIONSHIP AND AGE APPENDED QUESTIONS WRITTEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MEDIUM WERE ANSWERED RELEVANTLY IF NOT PERTINENTLY INVESTIGATORS GENERALLY DID THEIR PART OF THE WRITING IN A GUARDED MANNER
DO THEM UP INTO BALLS ABOUT THE SIZE OF HALF AN EGG AND FRY THEM BROWN TWELVE CALF'S FEET BOIL THEM WITH THE HEAD UNTIL TENDER THEN SPLIT AND LAY THEM ROUND THE HEAD OR DREDGE THEM WITH FLOUR AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN BOILED TENDER
COVER THE TOP OF THE MEAT WITH SOME OF THE DRESSING WHEN BAKED SUFFICIENTLY TAKE IT UP
WASH IT IN COLD WATER THEN LAY IT ON A GRIDIRON PLACE IT ON A HOT BED OF COALS AND BROIL IT AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT BURNING IT IF BROILED SLOW IT WILL NOT BE GOOD IT TAKES FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES TO BROIL A STEAK FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT POUNDS OF BEEF
OTHERWISE THE MEAT WILL RETAIN THE IMPRESSION OF THE BARS THE BARS OF THE GRIDIRON SHOULD BE CONCAVE AND TERMINATE IN A TROUGH TO CATCH THE JUICES OR THEY WILL DROP IN THE FIRE AND SMOKE THE MEAT A GOOD FIRE OF HOT COALS IS NECESSARY
REASON STALKS GRAVELY NOT TO SAY SULKILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AND STANDING AFAR OFF
THERE HE PAUSED WITH HIS HAND UPON IT HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY WAS HIS CARELESS ARTFUL QUESTION
KEEPING HIM STILL TRANSFIXED WITH HER DARKLY SPLENDID EYES AND WHETHER SHE ADMIRED OR OTHERWISE NO ONE COULD TELL FROM HER STILL CALM FACE THE PRINCE CONSORT'S FEELINGS
MIND LOVE CUT IN THE INEXORABLE DUKE
THE BATTEAU WAS ALONGSIDE AND ORMISTON TURNED A VERY WHITE AND EXCITED FACE TOWARD THE EARL OF ROCHESTER
YOU WILL FIND WINE AND GLASSES IN THE ROOM OPPOSITE THIS AND I FEEL SO FAINT THAT I THINK YOU HAD BETTER BRING ME SOME ORMISTON MOVED ACROSS THE PASSAGE LIKE THE GOOD OBEDIENT YOUNG MAN THAT HE WAS FILLED A GLASS OF BURGUNDY
IF YOU WILL ONLY PLEASE TO FIND THEM ORMISTON CROWED THE ROOM FORTUNATELY HE KNEW THE LATITUDE OF THE PLACE AND MOVING HIS HAND WITH GINGERLY PRECAUTION ALONG THE MANTEL SHELF LEST HE SHOULD UPSET ANY OF THE GIMCRACKS THEREON
LIKE A SECOND SODOM PERHAPS IT IS TO BE VERIFIED TO NIGHT NOT UNLIKELY THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO VIEW THE CONFLAGRATION
PRESSING OVER TO LIFT THE LADY MAY I BEG YOU TO ASSIST ME MY LORD
DO YOU YOUR HIGHNESS AND YOU LORD DUKE GO ON WITH THE EARL OF GLOUCESTER'S TRIAL AND I WILL BE THE STRANGER'S JAILER SHE IS RIGHT SAID THE DWARF HIS FIERCE LITTLE EYES GLEAMING WITH A MALIGNANT LIGHT
WITH A COOL AND RATHER CONTEMPTUOUS GLANCE IN HIS DIRECTION YOU LOOK EXTREMELY LIKE A CERTAIN HIGHWAYMAN WITH A MOST VILLAINOUS COUNTENANCE I ENCOUNTERED A FEW HOURS BACK
YES SIR I HAVE COME SAID SIR NORMAN WITH A POLITE BOW PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW ME MY DEAR YOUNG SIR YOUR LITTLE FRIEND YOU KNOW OF THE GOLDEN CROWN OH I PERFECTLY RECOGNIZE YOU MY LITTLE FRIEND
PROBABLY YOU MAY BE THE NAME YOU LOOK FIT FOR THAT OR ANYTHING ELSE CUT HIM DOWN DASH HIS BRAINS OUT RUN HIM THROUGH SHOOT HIM WERE A FEW OF THE MILD AND PLEASANT INSINUATIONS THAT WENT OFF ON EVERY SIDE OF HIM
LIKE A FIERCE VOLLEY OF POP GUNS AND A SCORE OF BRIGHT BLADES FLASHED BLUE AND THREATENING ON EVERY SIDE WHILE THE PRINCE BROKE OUT INTO ANOTHER SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER THAT RANG HIGH OVER ALL SIR NORMAN DREW HIS OWN SWORD AND STOOD ON THE DEFENCE
ORMISTON SPREAD HIS CLOAK IN THE STERN OF THE BOAT AND LAID HER TENDERLY UPON IT AND THOUGH THE BEAUTIFUL WISTFUL EYES WERE SOLEMNLY AND UNWINKINGLY FIXED ON HIS FACE THE PALE SWEET LIPS PARTED NOT UTTERED NEVER A WORD
I MEAN I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY ORMISTON SAW THE BLUSH AND THE EYES THAT DROPPED AND IT PUZZLED HIM AGAIN BEYOND MEASURE
I SUPPOSE I HAD SOME IDEA OF REACHING HOME WHEN I CAME HERE BUT THE CROWD PRESSED SO CLOSE BEHIND
FOR WHEN HIS HIGHNESS LAUGHED IT WAS A VERY BAD SIGN MY LITTLE FRIEND WILL HURT HIMSELF REMARKED SIR NORMAN WITH AN AIR OF SOLICITUDE IF HE INDULGES IN HIS EXUBERANT AND GLEEFUL SPIRITS TO SUCH AN EXTENT LET ME RECOMMEND YOU
AND ALL BEGAN FORMING THEMSELVES IN A SORT OF LINE OF MARCH
AND IT STRIKES ME THE DESIRE IS SOMEWHAT NATURAL WITHOUT DOUBT IT IS AND IT WILL SAVE SIR NORMAN MUCH FRUITLESS LABOR FOR EVEN NOW HE IS IN SEARCH OF YOU AND WILL NEITHER REST NOR SLEEP UNTIL HE FINDS YOU
IT WAS THE REASONING OF LOVE RATHER THAN LOGIC
AS MUCH STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN APPARITION AS THE FAIR SEX THE SAID FAIR SEX WERE STILL FIRING OFF LITTLE VOLLEYS OF SCREAMS IN CHORUS AND CLINGING DESPERATELY TO THEIR CAVALIERS AND EVERYTHING IN A WORD
GIVE ME THE DEATH WARRANT AND WHILE HER MAJESTY SIGNS IT I WILL PRONOUNCE HIS DOOM THE DUKE HANDED HIM A ROLL OF PARCHMENT
AGAIN AT THE LADY AND LASTLY AT ORMISTON HIS HANDSOME COUNTENANCE FULL OF THE MOST UNMITIGATED WONDER TO WHOM ASKED ORMISTON WHO HAD VERY LITTLE NEED TO INQUIRE
WAS STARTLED BY A CRY FROM THE LADY THAT NEARLY MADE HIM DROP AND SHIVER IT ON THE FLOOR WHAT UNDER HEAVEN HAS COME TO HER NOW HE THOUGHT HASTENING IN WONDERING HOW SHE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE COME TO GRIEF SINCE HE LEFT HER SHE WAS SITTING UPRIGHT ON THE SOFA
SHINING LIKE SILVER SHONE THE GLITTERING DRESS AND MARBLE FACE OF THE BRIDE A SMALL BATTEAU LAY CLOSE TO WHERE ORMISTON STOOD IN TWO SECONDS HE HAD SPRANG IN SHOVED IT OFF AND WAS ROWING VIGOROUSLY TOWARD THAT SNOW WREATH IN THE INKY RIVER
AND SIR NORMAN STARTED IN DISMAY TO FIND HIMSELF IN THE MOST GLOOMY APARTMENT HE HAD EVER BEHELD IN HIS LIFE IT WAS ALL COVERED WITH BLACK WALLS CEILING AND FLOOR WERE DRAPED IN BLACK AND REMINDED HIM FORCIBLY OF LA MASQUE'S CHAMBER OF HORRORS ONLY THIS WAS MORE REPELLANT
THE GIRL SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A GIRL DRANK IT OFF AND SAT UPRIGHT LIKE ONE INSPIRED WITH NEW LIFE AS SHE SET DOWN THE GLASS
UPON THIS HIS HIGHNESS NET UP SUCH ANOTHER SCREECH OF MIRTH THAT IT QUITE WOKE AN ECHO THROUGH THE ROOM
AND HIS VERY HEART STOOD STILL STOP HER STOP HER SHE IS ILL OF THE PLAGUE SHOUTED THE CROWD PREYING PANTING ON BUT THEY CAME TOO LATE
AND ASSISTED HER THERE AS TENDERLY AS HE COULD HAVE DONE LA MASQUE HERSELF HE PAUSED ON THE THRESHOLD FOR THE ROOM WAS DARK THERE IS A LAMP AND A TINDER BOX ON THE MANTEL SAID THE FAINT SWEET VOICE
CARPETED WITH CRIMSON AND GOLD AND BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED LIKE THE GRAND SALOON THEY HAD LEFT WAS THUS REVEALED AND THREE SIMILAR ARCHWAYS APPEARED AT THE EXTREMITY ONE TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT AND ONE DIRECTLY BEFORE THEM
STRIKING THE CONVULSED FACE WITH THE PALM OF HIS OPEN HAND THE FATE OF ALL TRAITORS AND OF ALL SPIES EXCLAIMED THE DWARF GLARING WITH HIS FIENDISH EYES UPON THE APPALLED SIR NORMAN
IF I HAVE TO SHOOT HIM MYSELF SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY STAND NEAR AND FEAR NOT AT HIS PERIL
GOOD AND WHAT DO YOU CONFESS SAID THE DUKE BLANDLY LEANING FORWARD WHILE THE DWARF FELL BACK WITH A YELL OF LAUGHTER AT THE SUCCESS OF HIS RUSE I CONFESS ALL EVERYTHING ANYTHING ONLY SPARE MY LIFE DO
I MEAN WITH A SLIGHT SHUDDER
THE EARL WITH A PERFECT SCREECH OF TERROR FLUNG HIMSELF FLAT UPON HIS FACE AND HANDS BEFORE THE QUEEN WITH SUCH FORCE THAT SIR NORMAN EXPECTED TO SEE HIS COUNTENANCE MAKE A HOLE IN THE FLOOR O MADAME SPARE ME
AND HALF A DOZEN HANDS WERE EXTENDED TO DRAW THE BOAT UP TO THE LANDING HE LIFTED THE LIGHT FORM IN HIS ARMS AND BORE IT FROM THE BOAT
YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE DWARF LAUGHING TO THAT EXTENT THAT HE RAN THE RISK OF RUPTURING AN ARTERY AFTER THAT
THE PRINCE SUDDENLY AND SHARPLY SET UP SUCH ANOTHER SCREECH OF LAUGHTER AS NO STEAMBOAT OR LOCOMOTIVE IN THE PRESENT AGE OF STEAM COULD BEGIN TO EQUAL IN GHASTLINESS WILL YOUR HIGHNESS HAVE THE GOODNESS TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE INQUIRED THE QUEEN
BEGAN TO FEEL AN UNCOMFORTABLE SENSE OF CHILL CREEPING OVER HIM AND TO THINK THAT THOUGH PRACTICAL JOKES WERE EXCELLENT THINGS IN THEIR WAY THERE WAS YET A POSSIBILITY OF CARRYING THEM A LITTLE TOO FAR
TURNED NOW TO HER CHAMPION WHO IS SHE ORMISTON HE SAID PERSUASIVELY BUT ORMISTON ONLY LAUGHED AND ROWED ENERGETICALLY FOR THE SHORE THE CROWD WAS STILL LINGERING
WHAT IS YOUR NAME SHE SIMPLY ASKED ORMISTON MADAME HE SAID
REPLIED THE RINGING VOICE WHILE THE BLACK EYES FLASHED ANYTHING BUT LOVING GLANCES UPON HIM WHILE I AM QUEEN HERE I SHALL BE OBEYED WHEN I AM QUEEN NO LONGER YOU MAY DO AS YOU PLEASE MY LORDS
THE BLACK SPECTRE MOVED THE DWARF MADE A SIGNAL THE GLITTERING AXE WAS RAISED FELL A SCREAM WAS CUT IN TWO A BRIGHT JET OF BLOOD SPOUTED UP IN THE SOLDIERS FACES BLINDING THEM
THE WHITEST MOST BEAUTIFUL AND MOST STONELIKE HE HAD EVER SEEN THANK YOU MY MAN THANK YOU MY LORD SAID ORMISTON PREPARING TO PUSH OFF ROCHESTER WHO HAD BEEN LEANING FROM THE BARGE GAZING IN MINGLED CURIOSITY
THANK GOD SHE EXCLAIMED FERVENTLY CLASPING HER HANDS
I NOTICED THAT THOUGH I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN DELIRIOUS AND THEN HALF MAD WITH AGONY I GOT OUT TO THE STREET SOMEHOW AND RAN AND RAN AND RAN UNTIL THE PEOPLE SAW AND FOLLOWED ME HERE
NO IT WAS YOUR PLUNGE INTO THE RIVER I HAVE HEARD OF ONE OR TWO SUCH CASES BEFORE AND IF EVER I TAKE IT SAID ORMISTON HALF LAUGHING HALF SHUDDERING MY FIRST RUSH SHALL BE FOR OLD FATHER THAMES HERE DRINK THIS
I DID BUT MY LORD MY LORD SPARE WHICH SUM OF MONEY YOU HAVE CONCEALED CONTINUED THE DUKE WITH ANOTHER FROWN AND A SHARP RAP NOW THE QUESTION IS WHERE HAVE YOU CONCEALED IT I WILL TELL YOU WITH ALL MY HEART ONLY SPARE MY LIFE
IN VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND EEL LIKE FASHION THE EARL WAS DRAGGED BACK TO HIS PLACE AND FORCIBLY HELD THERE BY TWO OF THE GUARDS WHILE HIS FACE GREW SO GHASTLY AND CONVULSED THAT SIR NORMAN TURNED AWAY HIS HEAD AND COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOK AT IT
WITH A STRONG FOREIGN ACCENT I KNOW IT STRUCK TEN AS WE PASSED SAINT PAUL'S THIS GRAND BONFIRE OF OUR MOST WORSHIPFUL LORD MAYOR WILL BE A SIGHT WORTH SEEING REMARKED THE EARL WHEN ALL THESE PILES ARE LIGHTED
SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY SHE SOFTLY REPEATED WITH A SORT OF RECOGNITION IN HER VOICE AND EYES
HE SUSPICIOUSLY ASKED BY SIGHT I KNOW MANY OF THE NOBLES OF THE COURT SHE ANSWERED EVASIVELY AND WITHOUT LOOKING UP THEY PASS HERE OFTEN AND PRUDENCE KNOWS THEM ALL AND SO I HAVE LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH THEM BY NAME AND SIGHT
SHOULD YOU FEEL MY PRESENCE HERE ANY RESTRAINT I AM QUITE READY AND WILLING TO TAKE MY DEPARTURE AT ANY MOMENT AND AS I BEFORE INSINUATED
OH THAT DREADFUL DREADFUL PLAGUE PIT SHE CRIED COVERING HER FACE WITH HER HANDS YES I AM ONE OF THOSE AND WHO WAS THE OTHER MY FRIEND SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY
TELL US FIRST AND WE WILL THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE AFTERWARD LET ME ADVISE YOU AS A FRIEND MY LORD TO TELL AT ONCE AND TRUTHFULLY SAID THE DUKE TOYING NEGLIGENTLY WITH THE THUMB SCREWS
AND DROWNING SEEMED TO ME PREFERABLE TO THAT SO I WAS IN THE RIVER BEFORE I KNEW IT AND YOU KNOW THE REST AS WELL AS I DO BUT I OWE YOU MY LIFE MISTER ORMISTON OWE IT TO YOU AND ANOTHER AND I THANK YOU BOTH WITH ALL MY HEART
THAT THAT FACE WAS UGLY HE DID NOT FOR AN INSTANT BELIEVE OR AT LEAST IT NEVER WOULD BE UGLY TO HIM WITH A FORM SO PERFECT A FORM A SYLPH MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
ALMOST SUFFOCATED BY THE SULTRY CLOSENESS
A SLIGHT FEMALE FIGURE WITH FLOATING ROBES OF WHITE WAVING HAIR OF DEEPEST BLACKNESS WITH A SPARKLE OF JEWELS ON NECK AND ARMS ONLY FOR AN INSTANT DID HE SEE IT BUT HE KNEW IT WELL
INQUIRED THE DUKE MAKING A POKE WITH HIS FOREFINGER AT SIR NORMAN IS HE TO STAY HERE OR IS HE TO ACCOMPANY US HIS HIGHNESS TURNED ROUND AND PUTTING HIS FACE CLOSE UP TO SIR NORMAN'S FAVORED HIM WITH A MALIGNANT GRIN
AND LET US SEE IF THEY WILL NOT EXERCISE THE DUMB DEVIL BY WHICH OUR GHASTLY FRIEND IS POSSESSED NO NO NO SHRIEKED THE EARL WHILE THE FOAM FLEW FROM HIS LIPS I CONFESS I CONFESS I CONFESS
FOOTSTEPS AND VOICES CAME CLOSER TWO FIGURES TOOK SHAPE IN THE GLOOM AND EMERGED FROM THE DARKNESS INTO THE GLIMMERING LAMP LIGHT HE RECOGNISED THEM BOTH
TURNING WITH AWFUL IMPRESSIVENESS TO THAT YOUNG PERSON DO YOU KNOW ME QUITE AS WELL AS I WISH TO
HE UTTERED SHRIEK AFTER SHRIEK OF FRENZIED DESPAIR AND STRUGGLED LIKE A MADMAN TO GET FREE BUT AS WELL MIGHT LAOCOON HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE FOLDS OF THE SERPENT THEY PULLED HIM ON BOUND HIM HAND AND FOOT AND HELD HIS HEAD FORCIBLY DOWN ON THE BLOCK
AND THE BOATMAN WAITING AS THEY PASSED FROM SIGHT ORMISTON CAME FORTH AND WATCHED THOUGHTFULLY AFTER THEM THE FACE AND FIGURE WERE THAT OF THE LADY BUT THE VOICE WAS DIFFERENT BOTH WERE CLEAR AND MUSICAL ENOUGH
HE WILL CERTAINLY NOT SURVIVE UNTIL MORNING SHE GAYLY LAUGHED BUT HER CHEEK WAS SCARLET RATHER THAN THAT MISTER ORMISTON I WILL EVEN SEE HIM TONIGHT YOU WILL FIND ME HERE WHEN YOU COME YOU WILL NOT RUN AWAY AGAIN WILL YOU
AND SPOKE IN A VOICE THAT REVERBERATED LIKE THE TOLLING OF A DEATH BELL THROUGH THE ROOM MY LORD OF GLOUCESTER YOU HAVE BEEN TRIED BY A COUNCIL OF YOUR FELLOW PEERS PRESIDED OVER BY HER ROYAL SELF AND FOUND GUILTY OF HIGH TREASON
I CAN SAFELY AVER THEY HAD NO SUCH DISMAL EFFECT ON ORMISTON NOTHING EARTHLY COULD HAVE GIVEN THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN A GREATER SHOCK OF JOY THAN THE KNOWLEDGE HE WAS TO BEHOLD THE LONG HIDDEN FACE OF HIS IDOL
AND AFTER THEM SIR NORMAN IN THE CUSTODY OF TWO OF THE SOLDIERS THE CONDEMNED EARL CAME LAST OR RATHER ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DRAGGED BY HIS FOUR GUARDS FOR HE SEEMED TO HAVE BECOME PERFECTLY PALSIED AND DUMB WITH FEAR
WAS SOMETHING WONDERFUL IT BROUGHT HIS THOUGHTS BACK FROM HIMSELF AND HIS OWN FORTUNATE LOVE TO HIS VIOLENTLY SMITTEN FRIEND SIR NORMAN AND HIS PLAGUE STRICKEN BELOVED AND HE BEGAN SPECULATING WHAT HE COULD POSSIBLY BE ABOUT JUST THEN
I BEG TO ASSURE YOU THAT MY COMING HERE WAS ALTOGETHER INVOLUNTARY ON MY PART
AND STOOD WITH HER BRIGHT LIPS PARTED AND HER BRIGHTER EYES DILATING IN SPEECHLESS WONDER THE BENCH WITH THE JUDGE AT THEIR HEAD HAD FOLLOWED HER EXAMPLE AND STOOD STARING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT LOOKING TRUTH TO TELL
AND I ENTREAT YOU WILL NOT MIND ME IN THE LEAST
DO NOT BELIEVE THE TALES THEY TELL YOU OF ME FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE SPARE MY LIFE CONFESS THUNDERED THE DWARF STRIKING THE TABLE WITH HIS CLINCHED FIST UNTIL ALL THE PAPERS THEREON JUMPED SPASMODICALLY INTO THE AIR CONFESS AT ONCE OR I SHALL RUN YOU THROUGH WHERE YOU STAND
AS A WELL WISHER TO SIT DOWN AND COMPOSE YOURSELF INSTEAD OF COMPLYING HOWEVER THE PRINCE WHO SEEMED BLESSED WITH A LIVELY SENSE OF THE LUDICROUS WAS SO STRUCK WITH THE EXTREME FUNNINESS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S SPEECH THAT HE RELAXED INTO ANOTHER PAROXYSM OF LEVITY
FROM THE SLIMIEST DEPTHS OF THE SLOUGH OF DESPOND TO THE TOPMOST PEAK OF THE MOUNTAIN OF ECSTASY HE UNCOVERED HIS HEAD THAT THE NIGHT AIR MIGHT COOL ITS FEVERISH THROBBINGS BUT THE NIGHT AIR WAS AS HOT AS HIS HEART AND
SUDDENLY HE WAS AROUSED A MOMENT BEFORE THE SILENCE HAD BEEN ALMOST OPPRESSIVE BUT NOW ON THE WINGS OF THE NIGHT THERE CAME A SHOUT A TUMULT OF VOICES AND FOOTSTEPS WERE APPROACHING
KEEPING TIME TO THE TRIUMPHANT MARCH AND PRESERVING DISMAL SILENCE
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A FATHER SOME TIME IN YOUR LIFE MOST PEOPLE HAVE SAID THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN REFLECTIVELY SHE SHOOK HER HEAD A LITTLE SADLY I NEVER HAD THAT I KNOW OF EITHER FATHER OR MOTHER OR ANY ONE BUT PRUDENCE
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE REASON THEREFORE
MY DEAR LITTLE FRIEND SAID SIR NORMAN DRAWING HIS SWORD AND FLOURISHING IT WITHIN AN INCH OF THE ROYAL NOSE JUST MAKE THAT REMARK AGAIN AND MY SWORD WILL CLEAVE YOUR PRETTY HEAD AS THE CIMETAR OF SALADIN CLOVE THE CUSHION OF DOWN
HE SO UGLY SO STUNTED SO DEFORMED SO FIENDISH AFTER THEM WENT THE BAND OF SYLPHS IN WHITE THEN THE CHANCELLOR ARCHBISHOP AND EMBASSADORS NEXT THE WHOLE COURT OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
MADAME YOU ARE TOO GRATEFUL AND I DON'T KNOW AS WE HAVE DONE ANYTHING MUCH TO DESERVE IT YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE AND THOUGH YOU MAY THINK THAT A VALUELESS TRIFLE NOT WORTH SPEAKING OF
WHY WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE ALONE ON THE RIVER AT THIS HOUR
THAT ROYAL LADY SPREAD THE VELLUM ON HER KNEE TOOK THE PEN AND AFFIXED HER SIGNATURE AS COOLLY AS IF SHE WERE INDITING A SONNET IN AN ALBUM THEN HIS HIGHNESS WITH A FACE THAT FAIRLY SCINTILLATED WITH DEMONIAC DELIGHT STOOD UP AND FIXED HIS EYES ON THE GHASTLY PRISONER
JOY JOY THAT THRILLED AND VIBRATED THROUGH EVERY NERVE WITHIN HIM LEANING AGAINST THE PORTAL IN AN ABSURD DELIRIUM OF DELIGHT
AND FINDING THE COMPANY WERE ALL ARRANGED IN THE ORDER OF GOING AND AWAITING HIS SOVEREIGN PLEASURE HE TURNED LET HIM COME HE SAID WITH HIS COUNTENANCE STILL DISTORTED BY INWARD MERRIMENT IT WILL DO HIM GOOD TO SEE HOW WE PUNISH OFFENDERS HERE
GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR LOST BUT BEFORE QUITE DOING SO TO USE A PHRASE NOT ALTOGETHER AS ORIGINAL AS IT MIGHT BE DETERMINED TO SELL HIS LIFE AS DEARLY AS POSSIBLE ANGRY EYES AND FIERCE FACES WERE ON EVERY HAND
I EARNESTLY ASSURE YOU MADAME THAT I HAD BUT JUST KNELT DOWN TO LOOK WHEN I DISCOVERED TO MY DISMAY THAT I WAS NO LONGER THERE BUT IN YOUR CHARMING PRESENCE IN THAT CASE MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN SAID THE QUEEN
THE WET BRIDAL ROBES WERE DRENCHED AND DRIPPING ABOUT HER THE LONG DARK HAIR HUNG IN SATURATED MASSES OVER HER NECK AND ARMS AND CONTRASTED VIVIDLY WITH A FACE ORMISTON THOUGHT AT ONCE
CONFESS ONCE MORE YELLED THE DWARF IN A TERRIBLE VOICE WHILE HIS STILL MORE TERRIBLE EYES FLASHED SPARKS OF FIRE CONFESS OR BY ALL THAT'S SACRED IT SHALL BE TORTURED OUT OF YOU GUARDS
I ASSURE YOU I VIEW IT IN A VERY DIFFERENT LIGHT SHE SAID WITH A HALF SMILE LADY YOUR LIFE IS INVALUABLE BUT AS TO OUR SAVING IT WHY YOU WOULD NOT HAVE US THROW YOU ALIVE INTO THE PLAGUE PIT WOULD YOU
IN SEARCH OF ME SHE SAID SOFTLY
AND HER VOICE RANG OUT LIKE A TRUMPET TONE SHEATHE YOUR SWORDS MY LORDS AND BACK EVERY MAN OF YOU NOT ONE HAIR OF HIS HEAD SHALL FALL WITHOUT MY PERMISSION AND THE FIRST WHO LAYS HANDS ON HIM UNTIL THAT CONSENT IS GIVEN SHALL DIE
STOP HER STOP HER WAS CRIED BY MANY VOICES AND THE NEXT INSTANT A FLEET FIGURE WENT FLYING PAST HIM WITH A RUSH
THE EXECUTIONER THREW A BLACK CLOTH OVER THE BLEEDING TRUNK AND HELD UP THE GRIZZLY HEAD BY THE HAIR AND SIR NORMAN COULD HAVE SWORN THE FEATURES MOVED AND THE DEAD EYES ROLLED ROUND THE ROOM
SO WEIRD AND BLOOD CURDLING THAT SIR NORMAN COULD HAVE PUT HIS HANDS OVER HIS EAR DRUMS TO SHUT OUT THE GHASTLY SOUND THE DISMAL ROOM THE VOICELESS SPECTATORS THE BLACK SPECTRE WITH THE GLITTERING AXE THE FEARFUL MUSIC STRUCK A CHILL TO HIS INMOST HEART
WITH THE QUEEN AND THE DWARF AT THEIR HEAD AND NEAR THIS ELEVATION STOOD A TALL BLACK STATUE WEARING A MASK AND LEANING ON A BRIGHT DREADFUL GLITTERING AXE THE MUSIC CHANGED TO AN UNEARTHLY DIRGE
THAT SINGULAR BEING I DON'T KNOW HER BUT I HAVE SEEN HER OFTEN WHY WAS PRUDENCE TALKING OF ME TO HER I WONDER THAT I DO NOT KNOW
AND I MUST BRING HER BACK TO THEM HE HALF LIFTED HER AS HE SPOKE AND THE BOATMAN GLAD ENOUGH TO GET RID OF ONE SICK OF THE PLAGUE HELPED HER INTO THE BATTEAU THE LADY WAS NOT INSENSIBLE
LONG AND SHRILL WHAT ARE YOUR MAJESTY'S COMMANDS
NO OTHER BATTALION HOWEVER FOLLOWED THIS FORLORN HOPE AND SEEING IT THE GENTLEMEN TOOK HEART OF GRACE AND CLOSED AROUND THE UNCEREMONIOUS INTRUDER THE QUEEN HAD SPRUNG FROM HER ROYAL SEAT
LOOKING RATHER AT A LOSS AND SCOWLING VENGEANCE DIRE AT THE HANDSOME QUEEN AND HER HANDSOME PROTEGE AS HE SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR OF STATE THE EARL WAS CONFESSING HIS GUILT OR ABOUT TO DO SO PRAY MY LORD SAID THE DWARF GLARING UPON THE PALLID PRISONER
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR CONSULTING MY INCLINATIONS THIS REPLY NEARLY OVERSET HIS HIGHNESS'S GRAVITY ONCE MORE BUT HE CHECKED HIS MIRTH AFTER THE FIRST IRRESISTIBLE SQUEAL
SOON OBTAINED THE ARTICLES NAMED AND STRUCK A LIGHT THE LADY WAS LEANING WEARILY AGAINST THE DOOR POST BUT NOW SHE CAME FORWARD AND DROPPED EXHAUSTED INTO THE DOWNY PILLOWS OF A LOUNGE IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU MADAME
AND WHAT IS MORE FELL BUT I WILL LEAVE THAT FOR HIMSELF TO DISCLOSE MEANTIME MAY I ASK THE NAME OF THE LADY I HAVE BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO SERVE UNDOUBTEDLY SIR MY NAME IS LEOLINE LEOLINE
BUT HE WAS FORESTALLED TWO HANDS WHITE AND JEWELED AS HER OWN REACHED OVER THE EDGE OF A GILDED BARGE AND WITH THE HELP OF THE BOATMEN LIFTED HER IN BEFORE SHE COULD BE PROPERLY ESTABLISHED ON THE CUSHIONED SEATS
A BREATHLESS SILENCE FOLLOWED THE QUESTION EVERYBODY SEEMED TO HOLD HIS VERY BREATH TO LISTEN EVEN THE QUEEN LEANED FORWARD AND AWAITED THE ANSWER EAGERLY AND THE MANY EYES THAT HAD BEEN RIVETED ON SIR NORMAN SINCE HIS ENTRANCE
SHOCKS OF JOY THEY TELL ME SELDOM KILL OF MY OWN KNOWLEDGE I CANNOT SAY FOR I HAVE HAD PRECIOUS LITTLE EXPERIENCE OF SUCH SHOCKS IN MY LIFETIME HEAVEN KNOWS BUT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE
SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY SIR NORMAN KINGSLEY RANG FROM LIP TO LIP OF THOSE WHO RECOGNIZED HIM AND ALL DREW CLOSER AND LOOKED AT HIM AS IF THEY REALLY COULD NOT MAKE UP THEIR MIND TO BELIEVE THEIR EYES AS FOR SIR NORMAN HIMSELF
AND TEACH HIM WHAT HE IS TO EXPECT HIMSELF IS YOUR MAJESTY READY MY MAJESTY HAS BEEN READY AND WAITING FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES REPLIED THE LADY OVER LOOKING HIS PROFFERED HAND WITH GRAND DISDAIN
ALREADY APPARENTLY ALMOST DEAD WITH FEAR WAS DRAGGED FORWARD BY HIS GUARDS PARALYZED AS HE WAS AT SIGHT OF THE STAGE WHICH HE KNEW TO BE THE SCAFFOLD
SHE RECOILED AND DREW BACK HER VERY GARMENTS FROM HIS TOUCH AS IF THAT TOUCH WAS POLLUTION EYEING HIM THE WHILE WITH A GLANCE FRIGID AND PITILESS AS DEATH THERE IS NO MERCY FOR TRAITORS SHE COLDLY SAID
HE IS INDEED KIND AND I AM MOST ANXIOUS TO THANK HIM I WILL BRING HIM HERE IN TWO HOURS THEN SAID ORMISTON WITH ENERGY AND THOUGH THE HOUR MAY BE A LITTLE UNSEASONABLE I HOPE YOU WILL NOT OBJECT TO IT FOR IF YOU DO
SHE IS DELIRIOUS WITH THE PLAGUE SHE WAS RUNNING THROUGH THE STREETS WE GAVE CHASE BUT SHE OUT STEPPED US AND IS NOW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THAMES ORMISTON WAITED TO HEAR NO MORE BUT RUSHED PRECIPITATELY DOWN TO THE WATERS EDGE
LET US DO ONE THING BEFORE ANOTHER AND AFTER WE HAVE SETTLED GLOUCESTER HERE WE WILL ATTEND TO THIS MAN'S CASE GUARDS KEEP A SHARP EYE ON YOUR NEW PRISONER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BE GOOD ENOUGH TO RESUME YOUR SEATS
FOR ON EVERY HAND ALL WAS SILENT
AND BY THE WAY SHE SAID HALF STARTING UP THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE IS TO SEE ABOUT THIS SAME PRUDENCE SHE MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE PRUDENCE IS NOWHERE IN THE HOUSE SAID ORMISTON QUIETLY AND WILL NOT BE SHE SAYS
THERE WAS A REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS A LITTLE LESS EXQUISITE THAN THOSE RAVISHING ITEMS AND THAT HER MORBID FANCY MADE HER IMAGINE IT HOMELY COMPARED WITH THEM BUT HE KNEW HE NEVER WOULD SHARE IN THAT OPINION
TWICE HE OPENED HIS EYES TO REPLY AND TWICE ALL SOUNDS DIED AWAY IN A CHOKING GASP DO YOU HEAR HIS HIGHNESS SHARPLY INQUIRED THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR
BUT THERE ARE FEW WHO WOULD RISK INFECTION FOR THE SAKE OF A MERE STRANGER INSTEAD OF DOING AS YOU DID YOU MIGHT HAVE SENT ME TO THE PEST HOUSE YOU KNOW OH AS TO THAT ALL YOUR GRATITUDE IS DUE TO SIR NORMAN HE MANAGED THE WHOLE AFFAIR
AND THE MISERABLE EARL OF GLOUCESTER WITH A GASPING UNEARTHLY CRY FELL BACK IN THE ARMS OF THE ATTENDANTS DEAD AND OPPRESSIVE SILENCE REIGNED AND SIR NORMAN WHO HALF BELIEVED ALL ALONG THE WHOLE THING WAS A FARCE
BUT SHE SPOKE ENGLISH WITH THE PUREST ACCENT WHILE HIS WAS THE VOICE OF A FOREIGNER IT MOST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE LIKENESSES WE SOMETIMES SEE AMONG PERFECT STRANGERS BUT THE RESEMBLANCE IN THIS EASE
FOUND MYSELF HERE A LIE A LIE EXCLAIMED THE DWARF FURIOUSLY IT IS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE I MET YOU AT THE BAR OF THE GOLDEN CROWN
A VOICE SWEETER THAN THE SINGING FOUNTAIN OF ARABIA HANDS AND FEET THE MOST PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL THE SUN EVER SHONE ON IT WAS SIMPLY A MORAL AND PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY THAT THEY COULD BE JOINED TO A REPULSIVE FACE
BUT EXTREMELY WIDE AWAKE AND GAZING AROUND HER WITH HER GREAT BLACK SHINING EYES BUT SHE MADE NO RESISTANCE EITHER SHE WAS TOO FAINT OR FRIGHTENED FOR THAT AND SUFFERED HERSELF TO BE HOISTED ABOUT PASSIVE TO ALL CHANGES
AND SEEING YOUR FACE AND HIS BENDING OVER ME ALL THE HORROR CAME BACK WITH THAT AWAKENING AND BETWEEN IT AND ANGUISH OF THE PLAGUE SORE I THINK I FAINTED AGAIN ORMISTON NODDED SAGACIOUSLY
THE SECRETS OF OUR KINGDOM AND THIS PLACE SAID THE DUKE STERNLY RAPPING DOWN THE PETITION WITH A ROLL OF PARCHMENT THE EARL GREW IF POSSIBLE A MORE GHASTLY WHITE I DO I MUST
AND DISAPPEARED WHO IS IT WHAT IS IT WHERE IS IT CRIED TWO OR THREE WATCHMEN BRANDISHING THEIR HALBERDS AND RUSHING UP AND THE CROWD A SMALL MOB OF A DOZEN OR SO
YOUR SENTENCE IS THAT YOU BE TAKEN HENCE IMMEDIATELY TO THE BLOCK AND THERE BE BEHEADED IN PUNISHMENT OF YOUR CRIME HIS HIGHNESS WOUND UP THIS SOMEWHAT SOLEMN SPEECH RATHER INCONSISTENTLY BURSTING OUT INTO ONE OF HIS SHRILLEST PEALS OF LAUGHTER
HER DRESS PALLED DOWN OFF HER SHOULDER WHERE THE PLAGUE SPOT HAD BEEN AND WHICH TO HIS AMAZEMENT HE SAW NOW PURE AND STAINLESS AND FREE FROM EVERY LOATHSOME TRACE YOU ARE CURED OF THE PLAGUE WAS ALL HE COULD SAY
SHOUTED THE DWARF CLAWING THE AIR WITH HIS HANDS AS IF HE COULD HAVE CLAWED THE HEART OUT OF HIS VICTIM'S BODY BACK WITH HIM TO HIS PLACE GUARDS AND SEE THAT HE DOES NOT LEAVE IT AGAIN SQUIRMING AND WRITHING AND TWISTING HIMSELF IN THEIR GRASP
RATHER SULKILY IS THIS INSULTING INTERLOPER TO GO FREE
THE CITY WILL BE ONE SEA OF FIRE A SLIGHT FORETASTE OF WHAT MOST OF ITS INHABITANTS WILL BEHOLD IN ANOTHER WORLD SAID THE PAGE WITH A FRENCH SHRUG I HAVE HEARD LILLY'S PREDICTION THAT LONDON IS TO BE PURIFIED BY FIRE
WHY DON'T YOU SEE IT YOURSELF SHE MIGHT BE HIS TWIN SISTER SHE MIGHT BE BUT AS SHE IS NOT
THE ALARM HAS NOW REACHED THE BOATS ON THE RIVER AND MANY EYES WITHIN THEM WERE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION WHENCE SHE HAD GONE DOWN SOON SHE REAPPEARED ON THE DARK SURFACE SOMETHING WHITER THAN SNOW WHITER THAN DEATH
IT IS BURIED AT THE NORTH CORNER OF THE OLD WALL AT THE HEAD OF BRADSHAW'S GRAVE YOU SHALL HAVE THAT AND A THOUSANDFOLD MORE IF YOU'LL ONLY PARDON ENOUGH BROKE IN THE DWARF WITH THE LOOK AND TONE OF AN EXULTANT DEMON THAT IS ALL WE WANT MY LORD DUKE
THE AXE FELL AGAIN AND THE EARL OF GLOUCESTER WAS MINUS THAT USEFUL AND ORNAMENTAL APPENDAGE A HEAD IT WAS ALL OVER SO QUICKLY THAT SIR NORMAN COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS HORRIFIED SENSES UNTIL THE DEED WAS DONE
AND COULD ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL LADIES COULD THAT SURPASSINGLY BEAUTIFUL QUEEN STAND THERE SERENELY UNMOVED TO WITNESS SUCH A CRIME WHILE HE YET LOOKED ROUND IN HORROR THE DOOMED MAN
THIS REFERENCE TO THE CEILING SEEMED TO EXPLAIN THE WHOLE MYSTERY AND EVERYBODY LOOKED UP AT THE CORNER WHENCE HE CAME FROM AND SAW THE FLAG THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED AS TO HIS SPEECH EVERYBODY HAD LISTENED TO IT WITH THE GREATEST OF ATTENTION
HER RISING WAS THE SIGNAL FOR THE UNSEEN BAND TO STRIKE UP A GRAND TRIUMPHANT
MIRANDA TRIED TO LOOK GRAVE AND WEAR THAT EXPRESSION OF SEVERE SOLEMNITY I AM TOLD QUEENS AND RICH PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BUT IN SPITE OF HERSELF A LITTLE PLEASED SMILE RIPPLED OVER HER FACE AND NOTICING IT AND THE BOW AND SPEECH
BEGAN ORMISTON WITH AS SOLICITOUS AN AIR AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN HER FATHER A GLASS OF WINE WOULD BE OF USE TO YOU I THINK AND THEN IF YOU WISH I WILL GO FOR A DOCTOR YOU ARE VERY KIND
AND NEVER SAY DIE HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO TAKE OFF HIS PLUMED HAT AND MAKE A PROFOUND OBEISANCE TO HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN WHO WAS ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH SURPRISED TO MAKE THE RETURN POLITENESS DEMANDED AND MERELY STARED AT HIM WITH HER GREAT
TURNING HER PASSIONATE BEAUTIFUL FACE TO THE HUSHED AUDIENCE AM I OR AM I NOT SOVEREIGN HERE MADAME YOU ALONE ARE OUR SOVEREIGN LADY AND QUEEN THEN WHEN I CONDESCEND TO COMMAND YOU SHALL OBEY
AND I FEAR I MUST OWN THAT RUMOR DREW ME HITHER RESPONDED SIR NORMAN INVENTING A POLITE LITTLE WORK OF FICTION FOR THE OCCASION AND LET ME ADD THAT I CAME TO FIND THAT RUMOR HAD UNDER RATED INSTEAD OF EXAGGERATED HER MAJESTY'S SAID CHARMS HERE SIR NORMAN
ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING MISSUS VANSTONE'S SPIRITS HAD BEEN SADLY DEPRESSED AT A PRIVATE INTERVIEW WITH MISS GARTH SHE HAD REFERRED AGAIN OF HER OWN ACCORD TO THE SUBJECT OF HER LETTER FROM LONDON
IN THE MINE WHAT IN THE DOCHART PIT YES MISTER STARR REPLIED HARRY REALLY HAS YOUR FAMILY NEVER LEFT THE OLD MINE SINCE THE CESSATION OF THE WORKS
WITH A PERFECT EXPLOSION OF THANKS FATHER MOTHER AND DAUGHTER SOWING THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE BROADCAST FROM THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR TO THE GARDEN GATES AS SOON AS THE CARRIAGE HAD DRIVEN AWAY
THE WHOLE OF THE MASSIVE FORESTS AND WHAT WENT ON IN THIS GIGANTIC CRUCIBLE WHERE ALL THIS VEGETABLE MATTER HAD ACCUMULATED SUNK TO VARIOUS DEPTHS
THE PALACE OF THE FORMER SOVEREIGNS OF SCOTLAND HE DID NOT NOTICE THE SENTINELS WHO STOOD BEFORE ITS GATEWAYS DRESSED IN THE UNIFORM OF THEIR HIGHLAND REGIMENT TARTAN KILT PLAID AND SPORRAN COMPLETE
OF A WOMAN OF TWICE HER AGE SHE LITERALLY FORCED HIM INTO HIS PART HER FATHER FELL ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR MISSUS VANSTONE AND MISS GARTH LOST THEIR INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS
IT IS ANOTHER THING ALTOGETHER TO FIND THE ACTORS HITHERTO ONLY THE SMALL PRELIMINARY ANNOYANCES PROPER TO THE OCCASION HAD SHOWN THEMSELVES AT EVERGREEN LODGE THE SOUND AND SERIOUS TROUBLES WERE ALL TO COME
DON'T TELL MY FATHER ABOUT THIS ACTING PLEASE I SHOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT THOSE WERE THE ONLY WORDS HE HAD SPIRIT ENOUGH TO UTTER HE DRIFTED AWAY AIMLESSLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SHRUBBERY
TO GO TO GRANTON PIER TO CATCH THE STEAMER WHICH IN THREE HOURS WOULD TAKE HIM UP THE FORTH AS FAR AS STIRLING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE PERHAPS IN PASSING ALONG THE CANONGATE
AS IT MIGHT HAPPEN THAT HIS ABSENCE WOULD BE PROLONGED FOR SOME DAYS HE WROTE TO SIR W ELPHISTON
WHICH LOOPED UP ITS CURTAINS AND THE BRIGHT DRESS FOR DINNER LAID READY ACROSS IT ON THE GAYLY PAINTED BATH WITH ITS PURE LINING OF WHITE ENAMEL ON THE TOILET TABLE WITH ITS SPARKLING TRINKETS ITS CRYSTAL BOTTLES
ACCORDINGLY WHEN FRANK PRESENTED HIMSELF AT COMBE RAVEN ON THE EVENTFUL MORNING THERE STOOD MISS GARTH PREPARED IN THE INTERPOLATED CHARACTER OF ARGUS TO ACCOMPANY LUCY AND FALKLAND TO THE SCENE OF TRIAL
SO SERENELY SELF DEMONSTRATIVE SO DROWSILY DEEP THAT IT DID IRRESISTIBLY SUGGEST A PET CAT'S ENJOYMENT UNDER A CARESSING HAND
THUS ALSO SHELLS ZOOPHYTES STAR FISH POLYPI SPIRIFORES EVEN FISH AND LIZARDS BROUGHT BY THE WATER
BECAME HYSTERICAL UNDER THE STRAIN OF PERPETUAL ANXIETY THE FAMILY DOCTOR DECLINED TO ANSWER FOR THE NERVOUS CONSEQUENCES IF SOMETHING WAS NOT DONE RENEWED EFFORTS WERE MADE IN EVERY DIRECTION
AND READ OVER YOUR PART AND DON'T LET YOUR ATTENTION WANDER IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY HELP IT I SHALL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE BEFORE THE EVENING IF YOU WILL COME HERE WITH PAPA'S PERMISSION
SHE HAD DECIDED ON CELEBRATING IT BY ACTING A PLAY HAD ISSUED HER ORDERS ACCORDINGLY AND HAD BEEN OBEYED BY HER DOCILE PARENTS AS IMPLICITLY AS USUAL MISSUS MARRABLE GAVE UP THE DRAWING ROOM TO BE LAID WASTE FOR A STAGE AND A THEATER
FROM THE NECKS OF THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF SELTZER WATER BOTTLES THIS LIQUID LOADED WITH CARBONIC ACID RUSHED IN TORRENTS OVER A DEEP SOFT SOIL SUBJECT TO SUDDEN OR SLOW ALTERATIONS OF FORM
THEY RUSHED WHERE THEY LIKED TEARING FROM THE SCARCELY FORMED ROCKS MATERIAL WITH WHICH TO COMPOSE SCHISTS SANDSTONES AND LIMESTONES THIS THE ROVING WAVES BORE OVER THE SUBMERGED AND NOW PEATY FORESTS
AND UNDER THE ACTION OF CARBONIC ACID NOW AT THE TIME WHEN THE EVENTS RELATED IN THIS STORY TOOK PLACE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MINES OF THE SCOTTISH COAL BEDS HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED BY TOO RAPID WORKING
NOT A DAY MISTER STARR YOU KNOW MY FATHER
IN THE HIGHER BEDS ARE FOUND ON THE CONTRARY LIGNITE AND FOSSIL WOOD SUBSTANCES IN WHICH THE QUANTITY OF CARBON IS INFINITELY LESS
THIS WAS THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH JAMES STARR ARRIVED AFTER MATURE REFLECTION THE CONTRADICTION WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO LETTERS ONLY WROUGHT IN HIM A MORE KEEN DESIRE TO VISIT THE DOCHART PIT AND BESIDES
I AM AT YOUR ORDERS REPLIED HARRY TELL ME HARRY IS YOUR FATHER WELL VERY WELL MISTER STARR AND YOUR MOTHER SHE IS WELL TOO
ROLLING AND UNROLLING HIS PART AND LOOKING PITEOUSLY IN THE FACES OF THE FRIENDS ABOUT HIM I KNOW I CAN'T DO IT HE SAID MAY I COME IN AFTER TEA AND HEAR MAGDALEN'S VIEWS THANK YOU
WERE HANDED TO THEIR REPRESENTATIVES ON THE SPOT FRANK'S FAINT REMONSTRANCES WERE REJECTED WITHOUT A HEARING THE DAYS AND HOURS OF REHEARSAL WERE CAREFULLY NOTED DOWN ON THE COVERS OF THE PARTS AND THE MARRABLES TOOK THEIR LEAVE
HIS WHOLE THOUGHT WAS TO REACH CALLANDER WHERE HARRY FORD WAS SUPPOSEDLY AWAITING HIM THE BETTER TO UNDERSTAND THIS NARRATIVE IT WILL BE AS WELL TO HEAR A FEW WORDS ON THE ORIGIN OF COAL DURING THE GEOLOGICAL EPOCH
PECULIAR FORM OF VEGETATION SUCH AS IS PROBABLY PRODUCED ON THE SURFACE OF THE INFERIOR PLANETS VENUS OR MERCURY WHICH REVOLVE NEARER THAN OUR EARTH AROUND THE RADIANT SUN OF OUR SYSTEM
AND MAINTAINED IN ITS SEMI FLUID STATE AS MUCH BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN AS BY THE FIRES OF THE INTERIOR MASS THE INTERNAL HEAT HAD NOT AS YET BEEN COLLECTED IN THE CENTER OF THE GLOBE THE TERRESTRIAL CRUST THIN AND INCOMPLETELY HARDENED
ALL THE FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY SUDDENLY BECAME UNRELIABLE PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES AFTER ENCOURAGING THE IDEA OF THE PLAY THEY DECLINED THE PERSONAL SACRIFICE OF ACTING IN IT OR THEY ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED A LAD OF EIGHTEEN AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF SIR ANTHONY ABSOLUTE THE STAGE MANAGER UNDERTAKING TO SUPPLY THE NECESSARY WRINKLES FROM THE ILLIMITABLE RESOURCES OF THEATRICAL ART
AND WE HAVE BUT FEW WANTS WELL HARRY SAID THE ENGINEER LEAD THE WAY
IN THE REGION WHICH EXTENDS BETWEEN EDINBURGH AND GLASGOW FOR A DISTANCE OF TEN OR TWELVE MILES
RATHER THAN TO THE WARNING OF HIS ANONYMOUS CONTRADICTOR INDEED SAID HE
KEPT CONTINUALLY FULL BY CURRENTS OF FRESH AND SALT WATERS THEY EAGERLY ASSIMILATED TO THEMSELVES THE CARBON WHICH THEY LITTLE BY LITTLE EXTRACTED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AS YET UNFIT FOR THE FUNCTION OF LIFE
WHAT IS YOUR HEAD RUNNING ON NOW THOUGHT MISS GARTH CASTING A SHARP LOOK AT NORAH'S DARK DOWNCAST FACE YOU'RE ONE OF THE IMPENETRABLE SORT GIVE ME MAGDALEN WITH ALL HER PERVERSITIES I CAN SEE DAYLIGHT THROUGH HER
QUITE RIGHT MY DEAR OBSERVED MISTER VANSTONE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS YOU SAY WERE DEAD AGAINST ME HERE WERE THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN A SCRAPE ON ONE SIDE AND MAGDALEN ON THE OTHER MAD TO ACT
KEPT ON THE WATCH TO THE END THE DISTRUST DARKENED AND DARKENED ON HER FACE AS SHE LOOKED AT HER SISTER AND FRANK
UNDER A THICK CARAPACE OF PUDDING STONE SCHIST
ALWAYS EXCEPTING THE TWO UNMANAGEABLE CHARACTERS OF LUCY THE WAITING MAID AND FALKLAND JULIA'S JEALOUS LOVER GENTLEMEN CAME SAW JULIA AT REHEARSAL OBSERVED HER STOUTNESS AND HER WIG
OF WHICH THE ENGINEER JAMES STARR HAD SO LONG DIRECTED THE WORKS FOR TEN YEARS THESE MINES HAD BEEN ABANDONED
THE OLD MINER HAD EVIDENTLY NOT WRITTEN IT BUT NO LESS EVIDENTLY THE AUTHOR OF THIS SECOND LETTER KNEW THE OVERMAN'S SECRET SINCE IT EXPRESSLY CONTRADICTED THE INVITATION TO THE
MISS MARRABLE WAS THAT HARDEST OF ALL BORN TYRANTS AN ONLY CHILD SHE HAD NEVER GRANTED A CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE TO HER OPPRESSED FATHER AND MOTHER SINCE THE TIME WHEN SHE CUT HER FIRST TOOTH HER SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY WAS NOW NEAR AT HAND
ALL BE SERIOUS ENOUGH IF YOU HAD MY RESPONSIBILITIES NO PAPA NO WINE TO DAY THANK YOU I MUST KEEP MY INTELLIGENCE CLEAR WATER THOMAS AND A LITTLE MORE JELLY I THINK BEFORE YOU TAKE IT AWAY
CHARACTERS AND THEN BROKE DOWN IN THE EFFORT TO STUDY THEM OR THEY VOLUNTEERED TO TAKE THE PARTS WHICH THEY KNEW WERE ALREADY ENGAGED AND DECLINED THE PARTS WHICH WERE WAITING TO BE ACTED
RETIRED TO THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM AND SPOKE TOGETHER IN WHISPERS IT GREW LATER AND LATER AND STILL MAGDALEN NEVER FLINCHED FROM HER TASK STILL WITH EQUAL PERSEVERANCE NORAH WHO HAD BEEN ON THE WATCH ALL THROUGH THE EVENING
THE RIVALS HAVING BEEN CHOSEN AS THE PLAY MISS MARRABLE AS A MATTER OF COURSE APPROPRIATED TO HERSELF THE PART OF LYDIA LANGUISH
AND THE HIGH TEMPERATURE MAINTAINED BY THE INTERNAL FIRES AT THIS TIME SO CLOSE TO IT THUS THERE WAS ONE KINGDOM SUBSTITUTED FOR ANOTHER IN THIS SLOW BUT IRRESISTIBLE REACTION THE VEGETABLE WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A MINERAL
THE FEW ATTEMPTS HE MADE TO VARY THE STERNLY PRACTICAL NATURE OF THE EVENING'S OCCUPATION BY SLIPPING IN COMPLIMENTS SIDELONG
WHEN FRANK PRESENTED HIMSELF IN THE EVENING IGNORANT OF THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF HIS PART SHE TOOK HIM IN HAND AS A MIDDLE AGED SCHOOLMISTRESS MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IN HAND A BACKWARD LITTLE BOY
HE WENT TO BED MORE EXCITED THAN THE AFFAIR PERHAPS WARRANTED THE NEXT DAY AT FIVE O'CLOCK JAMES STARR JUMPED OUT OF BED DRESSED HIMSELF WARMLY
ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDINGS HAD BEEN CARRIED TO A DEPTH OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR EVEN OF TWO THOUSAND FEET AND WHEN JAMES STARR HAD RETIRED IT WAS WITH THE FULL CONVICTION THAT EVEN THE SMALLEST VEIN HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED
HAD SPOKEN SELF REPROACHFULLY OF HER WEAKNESS IN ADMITTING CAPTAIN WRAGGE'S IMPUDENT CLAIM TO A FAMILY CONNECTION WITH HER AND HAD THEN REVERTED TO THE STATE OF HER HEALTH
SHE VENTURED ON PUTTING THE QUESTION FIRST TO THE MISTRESS AND RECEIVING NO ANSWER IN THAT QUARTER SECONDLY TO THE MAID ALL THE AFTERNOON MISS OFF AND ON WAS THE WEARY ANSWER
SHE SMILED WHEN SHE WAS OUTSIDE ON THE LANDING THE FEMALE MIND DOES OCCASIONALLY THOUGH NOT OFTEN PROJECT ITSELF INTO THE FUTURE MISS GARTH WAS PROPHETICALLY PITYING MAGDALEN'S UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND
SO THEN THE ORIGIN OF COAL MINES IN WHATEVER PART OF THE GLOBE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IS THIS
WHO AFFECT TO IGNORE THE ALL IMPORTANT INFLUENCE WHICH FEMALE FEEDING EXERTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF FEMALE BEAUTY ON THIS OCCASION SHE REFUSED ONE DISH AFTER ANOTHER WITH A RESOLUTION WHICH IMPLIED THE RAREST OF ALL MODERN MARTYRDOMS
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE THINKING OF ANDREW WHEN YOU GAVE YOUR CONSENT
AS FAST AS SHE TEACHES ME ONE SPEECH
AND BROUGHT WITH HER THE DRAMATIC QUALIFICATION OF HABITUALLY WEARING A WIG IN PRIVATE LIFE THANKS TO THESE VIGOROUS MEASURES THE PLAY WAS AT LAST SUPPLIED WITH REPRESENTATIVES
THIS QUESTION JAMES STARR COULD NOT CEASE ASKING HIMSELF WAS HE CALLED TO MAKE CONQUEST OF ANOTHER CORNER OF THESE RICH TREASURE FIELDS FAIN WOULD HE HOPE IT WAS SO
OMITTED TO NOTICE THAT HER HEART WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE QUAILED AT THE PROSPECT APOLOGIZED AND RETIRED LADIES READ THE PART OF LUCY REMARKED THAT SHE APPEARED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE PLAY
WITH THE PART HANGING OPEN IN HIS HAND THE MOST INCAPABLE OF FALKLANDS AND THE MOST HELPLESS OF MANKIND FRANK'S DEPARTURE LEFT THE FAMILY BY THEMSELVES
ENGINEER TO GO TO THE YARROW SHAFT WAS IT REALLY TRUE THAT THE FIRST COMMUNICATION WAS NOW WITHOUT OBJECT DID SOMEONE WISH TO PREVENT JAMES STARR FROM TROUBLING HIMSELF EITHER USELESSLY OR OTHERWISE
THE GIRL'S FERVID TEMPERAMENT INTENSIFIED THE ESSENTIALLY FEMININE PLEASURE THAT MOST WOMEN FEEL IN THE PASSAGE OF THE COMB THROUGH THEIR HAIR TO A LUXURY OF SENSATION WHICH ABSORBED HER IN ENJOYMENT
THE SOIL OF THE CONTINENTS WAS COVERED WITH IMMENSE FORESTS CARBONIC ACID SO SUITABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM ABOUNDED THE FEET OF THESE TREES WERE DROWNED IN A SORT OF IMMENSE LAGOON
THROUGH AND THROUGH HER MISTRESS'S HAIR ALL CONVEYED THE SAME SOOTHING IMPRESSION OF DROWSY DELICIOUS QUIET ON ONE SIDE OF THE DOOR WERE THE BROAD DAYLIGHT AND THE FAMILIAR REALITIES OF LIFE
DISCOURAGING ISN'T IT GOODNIGHT
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW SEAM OF COAL WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT EVENT COULD SIMON FORD'S COMMUNICATION RELATE TO A FACT OF THIS NATURE
THE SECOND LETTER HAD FOR AN INSTANT CHECKED HIS SPECULATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT BUT NOW HE THOUGHT OF THAT LETTER NO LONGER BESIDES THE SON OF THE OLD OVERMAN WAS THERE WAITING AT THE APPOINTED RENDEZVOUS THE ANONYMOUS LETTER WAS THEREFORE WORTH NOTHING
MISTER MARRABLE SECURED THE SERVICES OF A RESPECTABLE PROFESSIONAL PERSON TO DRILL THE YOUNG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND TO ACCEPT ALL THE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES INCIDENTAL TO CREATING A DRAMATIC WORLD OUT OF A DOMESTIC CHAOS
AND COMFORTABLY ARRAYED IN HER MORNING WRAPPER UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO DRESS FOR DINNER AND THERE BEHIND HER SAT THE LADY'S MAID SLOWLY COMBING OUT THE LONG HEAVY LOCKS OF HER YOUNG MISTRESS'S HAIR
THUS IN THE LOWEST LAYERS OF THE COAL GROUND APPEARS THE ANTHRACITE WHICH BEING ALMOST DESTITUTE OF VOLATILE MATTER CONTAINS THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF CARBON
VERY WELL SAID STARR WITHOUT SPEAKING OF THE ANONYMOUS LETTER THEN CONTINUING
AND THE QUIETER THE HOUSE IS THE MORE OBLIGED I SHALL FEEL TO EVERYBODY BEFORE MISS GARTH'S BATTERY OF REPROOF COULD OPEN FIRE BEFORE THE FIRST OUTBURST OF MISTER VANSTONE'S HEARTY LAUGHTER COULD ESCAPE HIS LIPS
A LADY WHOSE AGE WAS UNKNOWN AND WHOSE PERSONAL APPEARANCE WAS STOUT BUT WHOSE HEART WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE VOLUNTEERED TO ACT THE PART OF THE SENTIMENTAL JULIA
I KNEW YOU DIRECTLY SIR REPLIED THE YOUNG MINER CAP IN HAND YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED YOU LOOK JUST AS YOU DID WHEN YOU BADE US GOOD BY IN THE DOCHART PIT I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THAT DAY PUT ON YOUR CAP HARRY SAID THE ENGINEER
FRANK'S HELPLESS ASTONISHMENT AT HER DISAPPEARANCE ADDED A NEW ELEMENT OF ABSURDITY TO THE SCENE HE STOOD FIRST ON ONE LEG AND THEN ON THE OTHER
AND TO THE DOUBTFUL PROSPECT THAT AWAITED HER IN THE COMING SUMMER IN A TONE OF DESPONDENCY WHICH IT WAS VERY DISTRESSING TO HEAR ANXIOUS TO CHEER HER SPIRITS MISS GARTH HAD CHANGED THE CONVERSATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
HAD REFERRED TO THE APPROACHING THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE AND HAD RELIEVED MISSUS VANSTONE'S MIND OF ALL ANXIETY IN THAT DIRECTION BY ANNOUNCING HER INTENTION OF ACCOMPANYING MAGDALEN TO EACH REHEARSAL
AND FADED OUT OF IT ALTOGETHER IN THE LATTER HALF OBJECTED TO PASS FROM THE NOTICE OF THE AUDIENCE IN THAT MANNER WHEN ALL THE REST HAD A CHANCE OF DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES TO THE END SHUT UP THE BOOK APOLOGIZED AND RETIRED
AFTER TEA MY VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF FALKLAND WILL BE AT YOUR DISPOSAL THOMAS WHATEVER ELSE THE GARDENER DOES HE IS NOT TO MAKE ANY FLORICULTURAL NOISES UNDER MY WINDOW
AND WAS THE SIGNAL ACCORDINGLY FOR AN ATTACK ON MISTER VANSTONE'S INVETERATE CARELESSNESS IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS PATERNAL AUTHORITY
A REGULAR CHEMICAL OPERATION A SORT OF DISTILLATION ALL THE CARBON CONTAINED IN THESE VEGETABLES HAD AGGLOMERATED AND LITTLE BY LITTLE COAL WAS FORMING UNDER THE DOUBLE INFLUENCE OF ENORMOUS PRESSURE
OR SETTLING TOGETHER IN A HEAP THEY FORMED A SOLID MASS AS THE WATERS WERE CONTAINED IN NO BED
OR THEY WERE AFFLICTED WITH WEAK CONSTITUTIONS AND MISCHIEVOUSLY FELL ILL WHEN THEY WERE WANTED AT REHEARSAL OR THEY HAD PURITAN RELATIVES IN THE BACKGROUND AND AFTER SLIPPING INTO THEIR PARTS
WITH THE SLEEPY RESIGNATION OF A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THAT EMPLOYMENT FOR SOME HOURS PAST THE SUN WAS SHINING AND THE GREEN SHUTTERS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WERE CLOSED THE DIM LIGHT FELL TENDERLY ON THE TWO QUIET SEATED FIGURES
I COULDN'T SAY I HAD METHODISTICAL OBJECTIONS I'VE NOTHING METHODISTICAL ABOUT ME WHAT OTHER EXCUSE COULD I MAKE THE MARRABLES ARE RESPECTABLE PEOPLE AND KEEP THE BEST COMPANY IN CLIFTON
HAVING FURTHER ACCUSTOMED THEMSELVES TO THE BREAKING OF FURNITURE AND THE STAINING OF WALLS TO THUMPING TUMBLING HAMMERING AND SCREAMING TO DOORS ALWAYS BANGING AND TO FOOTSTEPS PERPETUALLY RUNNING UP AND DOWN STAIRS
MAGDALEN PRESENTED HERSELF TO THE GENERAL OBSERVATION UNDER AN ENTIRELY NEW ASPECT IF ANY MORE VISITORS CALL TO DAY SHE SAID WITH THE PROFOUNDEST GRAVITY OF LOOK AND MANNER
SHOWS THAT FORD'S COMMUNICATION MUST BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO MORROW AT THE APPOINTED TIME I SHALL BE AT THE RENDEZVOUS IN THE EVENING STARR MADE HIS PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE
ARE YOU HARRY FORD ASKED THE ENGINEER QUICKLY YES MISTER STARR
FOR NORAH AND HIMSELF MISSUS VANSTONE DECLINED ACCOMPANYING THEM ON ACCOUNT OF HER HEALTH AND MISS GARTH ONLY ENGAGED TO MAKE ONE AMONG THE AUDIENCE CONDITIONALLY ON NOT BEING WANTED AT HOME THE PARTS OF LUCY AND FALKLAND
ALLOWED IT TO SPREAD THROUGH ITS PORES
ADDRESSED TO AN AUDIENCE WHICH INCLUDED A FATHER OF MISTER VANSTONE'S DISPOSITION AND A DAUGHTER OF MAGDALEN'S TEMPERAMENT PRODUCED THE RESULT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED FROM THE FIRST
WHAT HARM CAN SHE GET IN THEIR HOUSE IF YOU COME TO PRUDENCE AND THAT SORT OF THING WHY SHOULDN'T MAGDALEN DO WHAT MISS MARRABLE DOES THERE THERE LET THE POOR THINGS ACT AND AMUSE THEMSELVES
AND ANOTHER LAID VIOLENT HANDS ON SIR LUCIUS O'TRIGGER THESE TWO WERE FOLLOWED BY AN ACCOMMODATING SPINSTER RELATIVE WHO ACCEPTED THE HEAVY DRAMATIC RESPONSIBILITY OF MISSUS MALAPROP
GASTRIC MARTYRDOM I HAVE CONCEIVED THE PART OF LUCY SHE OBSERVED WITH THE DEMUREST GRAVITY THE NEXT DIFFICULTY IS TO MAKE FRANK CONCEIVE THE PART OF FALKLAND I SEE NOTHING TO LAUGH AT YOU WOULD
IT MAY BE A MISTAKE SAID NORAH TAKING HER FATHER'S PART AS USUAL BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW PAPA OR ANY ONE ELSE COULD HAVE DECLINED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THIS IS A FAR MORE SERIOUS MATTER THAN ANY OF YOU SUPPOSE
SURELY MY SILENCE WAS A SUFFICIENT WARNING TO YOU TO SAY NO A MISTAKE MISTER VANSTONE CHIMED IN MISS GARTH MADE WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS BUT A MISTAKE FOR ALL THAT
WITH THIS LAMENTABLE STORY AND WITH THE HUMBLEST APOLOGIES FOR PRESUMING ON A SLIGHT ACQUAINTANCE THE MARRABLES APPEARED AT COMBE RAVEN TO APPEAL TO THE YOUNG LADIES FOR A LUCY
ACTORS AND ACTRESSES WERE SOUGHT WITH A DESPERATE DISREGARD OF ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF PERSONAL FITNESS NECESSITY WHICH KNOWS NO LAW EITHER IN THE DRAMA OR OUT OF IT
NO IT WAS I THEN DID SIMON FORD SEND ME A SECOND LETTER TO CONTRADICT THE FIRST ASKED THE ENGINEER QUICKLY
THE NOMINAL MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE FONDLY BELIEVED THAT THEIR CHIEF TROUBLES WERE OVER INNOCENT AND FATAL DELUSION IT IS ONE THING IN PRIVATE SOCIETY TO SET UP THE STAGE AND CHOOSE THE PLAY
THREE FULL REHEARSALS WERE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
THE COOL FRAGRANCE OF FLOWERS AND PERFUMES IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE RAPT ATTITUDE OF MAGDALEN ABSORBED OVER HER READING THE MONOTONOUS REGULARITY OF MOVEMENT IN THE MAID'S HAND AND ARM AS SHE DREW THE COMB SMOOTHLY
IF AFTER ALL IT WAS A HOAX IT WAS WELL WORTH WHILE TO PROVE IT STARR ALSO THOUGHT IT WISER TO GIVE MORE CREDENCE TO THE FIRST LETTER THAN TO THE SECOND THAT IS TO SAY TO THE REQUEST OF SUCH A MAN AS SIMON FORD
AND TO THE UNIVERSE FOR A FALKLAND WITH THE MENDICANT PERTINACITY OF A FAMILY IN DESPAIR THIS STATEMENT OF CIRCUMSTANCES
TAKING LEAVE OF MISTER VANSTONE AT THE HALL DOOR I'M TO COME TO MORROW AND HEAR MORE OF HER VIEWS IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION I SHALL NEVER DO IT DON'T TELL HER I SAID SO
DINNER TIME PRESENTED THE FAIR STUDENT TO THE FAMILY EYE IN THE SAME MENTALLY ABSORBED ASPECT ON ALL ORDINARY OCCASIONS MAGDALEN'S APPETITE WOULD HAVE TERRIFIED THOSE FEEBLE SENTIMENTALISTS
INTIMATELY AS MISS GARTH WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THIS PECULIARITY IN HER PUPIL SHE NOW SAW IT ASSERTING ITSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ASSOCIATION WITH MENTAL EXERTION OF ANY KIND ON MAGDALEN'S PART
AND THERE THE THEATRICAL PROCEEDINGS CAME TO A PAUSE NINE MORE SPEAKING CHARACTERS WERE LEFT TO BE FITTED WITH REPRESENTATIVES AND WITH THAT UNAVOIDABLE NECESSITY THE SERIOUS TROUBLES BEGAN
SHE BOWED TO THEM WITH IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY ASCENDED THE HOUSE STEPS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE AT A WALK INSTEAD OF A RUN AND RETIRED THEN AND THERE TO THE BEDROOM REGIONS
AND EVERYWHERE FROM THE GARRET TO THE KITCHEN THE HOUSE SEEMED HARDLY LIKE ITSELF WITH THE ONE EVER DISTURBING ELEMENT IN THE FAMILY SERENITY SUDDENLY WITHDRAWN FROM IT
WAS AMONG THE PECULIARITIES OF HER CHARACTER WHICH WERE NOTORIOUS TO EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE IT WAS ONE OF HER FATHER'S FAVORITE JOKES THAT SHE REMINDED HIM ON SUCH OCCASIONS OF A CAT HAVING HER BACK STROKED
MISS MAGDALEN SAYS IT SOOTHES HER FEELINGS AND CLEARS HER MIND KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE THAT INTERFERENCE WOULD BE HOPELESS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MISS GARTH TURNED SHARPLY AND LEFT THE ROOM
AND IT MAY BE SAID THAT THEY WERE DESTINED TO STORE IT IN THE FORM OF COAL IN THE VERY BOWELS OF THE EARTH IT WAS THE EARTHQUAKE PERIOD CAUSED BY INTERNAL CONVULSIONS WHICH SUDDENLY MODIFIED THE UNSETTLED FEATURES OF THE TERRESTRIAL SURFACE
THE SANCTUARY OF UNRUFFLED REPOSE MISS GARTH PAUSED ON THE THRESHOLD AND LOOKED INTO THE ROOM IN SILENCE MAGDALEN'S CURIOUS FANCY FOR HAVING HER HAIR COMBED AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS
THE RAILWAY CONVEYED THE THREE IN EXCELLENT TIME TO EVERGREEN LODGE
BETWEEN THESE TWO BEDS ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF PRESSURE TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED ARE FOUND VEINS OF GRAPHITE AND RICH OR POOR COAL IT MAY BE ASSERTED THAT IT IS FOR WANT OF SUFFICIENT PRESSURE
TRAILED THEM ALL THE WAY BUT THE MEXICANS DID NOT DARE START A FIGHT WHEN THEY REACHED THE CAMP WHERE GENERAL MILES WAS WAITING GERONIMO STALKED HAUGHTILY TO THE GENERAL WHO STARED COLDLY
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE LAST SURRENDER LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD DISMOUNTED HANDED THE REINS OF HIS HORSE TO ONE OF THE COURIERS AND SHOOK HANDS WITH GERONIMO
CALHOUN'S OWN HAND THEN BY THE HAND OF ANOTHER
HOW A COMPANY OF MUSTANGERS HAS FOR THE NONCE CONVERTED ITSELF INTO A BAND OF CUADRILLA OF SALTEADORES OR DISGUISED AS INDIANS LEVIED BLACK MAIL UPON THE TRAIN OF THE PRAIRIE TRAVELLER
IT COULD SCARCE HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS HIS COUSINS HAD NOT BEEN SUCH AS TO SECURE THEIR ESTEEM WHILE HIS UNCLE THE PROUD WOODLEY POINDEXTER
IN THE REVISION IMPROVED HER STYLE AND EVEN HER IDEAS WHEN SHE HAD DONE WORKING IN THE MORNING SHE USUALLY LUNCHED AT A SMALL OSTERIA
LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD MARCHED WITH THEM CAPTAIN LAWTON PROVIDED AN ESCORT OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS AND A MOB OF TWO HUNDRED MEXICANS WHO FINALLY SAW THE HATED APACHES IN CAPTIVITY
AND THAT SHE WOULD NOT APPROVE OF IT OR CONSENT TO IT IN ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS TO SIT ALONE WITH A GENTLEMAN IN A CAFE IN THE EVENING AND CORNELIE ALSO REMEMBERED THE HAGUE
AS WELL AS WITHIN THE WALLS OF ITALIAN CITIES ALAS THERE IS NO SPOT UPON EARTH WHERE GOLD CANNOT
I HAVE MERELY RIDDEN FAR AND FAST SO THAT I MAY TALK WITH GERONIMO YOU DID NOT SAY MY FRIEND GERONIMO GERONIMO POINTED OUT YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND
AND COULD AT ANY MOMENT HAVE PROCLAIMED HIMSELF ITS MASTER CONSCIOUS OF HIS POWER HE HAD OF LATE BEEN USING IT TO EFFECT
ON THIS SOFA I HOPE YOU WON'T MIND BUT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE MY OWN SEAT NOW AND THE SATIN FRIGATE SMILED AMIABLY BUT WHEN THE VAN DER STAALS AND CORNELIE ROSE IN MUTE AMAZEMENT
BUT THEY WENT IN AND THE MOONLIGHT BLUE OF THE NIGHT SHONE THROUGH THE OPEN ARCHES THE ROUND PIT OF THE ARENA WAS BLACK ON ONE SIDE WITH SHADOW WHILE THE STREAM OF MOONLIGHT POURED IN ON THE OTHER SIDE LIKE A WHITE FLOOD
IF WE HAND OUR ARMS OVER TO LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD WHO WILL PROTECT US UNTIL WE ARE SAFE IN FLORIDA SUDDENLY GERONIMO WHO HAD BEEN SILENT
IN FLORIDA OR BE KILLED BY SOLDIERS WE MAY ALSO KILL SOLDIERS GERONIMO REMINDED HIM THAT YOU HAVE PROVEN MANY TIMES LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD ADMITTED BUT YOU REMEMBER THE TIMES OF LONG AGO
I SAW YOUR MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
UPON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BUT MORE ESPECIALLY ON THE NIGHT OF THE DUEL HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THOSE WHO HAD CARRIED HIM HOME ON THE STRETCHER AND FROM SOME EXTRAVAGANT EXPRESSIONS HE HAD MADE USE OF
HE EXPERIENCED THE MISERY OF A MAN BELIEVING THAT NO HUMAN BEING CARED A STRAW WHETHER HE SHOULD LIVE OR DIE ANY SYMPATHY SHOWN TO HIM WAS UPON THE SCORE OF RELATIONSHIP
WHERE SHE NEARLY ALWAYS MET DUCO VAN DER STAAL AND HAD HER MEAL WITH HIM AT A LITTLE TABLE AS A RULE SHE DINED AT BELLONI'S BESIDE THE VAN DER STAALS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A LITTLE DIVERSION
NOT EVEN YET REALIZING WHAT HAD HAPPENED ASTOUNDED BUT GAY THEY SAT DOWN IN ANOTHER CORNER THE GIRLS STILL SEIZED WITH AN IRREPRESSIBLE GIGGLE THE TWO AESTHETIC LADIES WITH THE EVENING DRESS
EAGERLY VERY WELL LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD SAID THEY WISH YOU TO SURRENDER SO THAT YOU MAY JOIN THEM AND I AM TO REMIND YOU THAT AN ENEMY MORE MERCILESS THAN ANY SOLDIERS LIES IN WAIT
THERE WAS A MEXICAN AT THE TIME MAKING ABODE IN THE VILLAGE LIKE MAURICE HIMSELF A MUSTANGER BUT ONE OF THOSE WITH WHOM THE YOUNG IRISHMAN HAD SHOWN A DISINCLINATION TO ASSOCIATE
THE GREAT CHIEF IN COMMAND OF THE SOLDIERS WHO ARE PURSUING YOU I ASK YOUR SURRENDER AND THE SURRENDER OF ALL YOUR BAND GERONIMO ASKED AND WHAT DOES GENERAL MILES OFFER IN RETURN
GUARANTEEING THEIR OWN SAFETY WHEN THEY RESUMED THEIR TALKS THE NEXT DAY GERONIMO SAID BLUNTLY TO LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD FORGET YOU ARE A WHITE MAN AND PRETEND YOU ARE ONE OF US
WHO TOOK THEM FIRST TO PRISON CELLS AT ARIZONA'S FORT BOWIE THEN TO THE TRAIN THAT CARRIED THEM TO EXILE IN FLORIDA
LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD SAID YOU HAVE HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVE THAT YOU WOULD LIVE IN PEACE ON THE RESERVATION THERE WILL NOT BE ANOTHER CHANCE GENERAL MILES ORDERS STAND ACCEPT IMPRISONMENT
THE GIRLS OF FOOT PADS AND DUCO AND CORNELIE WENT BY THEMSELVES THE STREETS WERE QUITE EMPTY THE COLOSSEUM ROSE MENACINGLY LIKE A FORTRESS IN THE NIGHT
SO ANY ONE WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED AND SO FOR A TIME THOUGHT THE MEXICAN HIMSELF FOR IN THEIR FIRST INTERVIEW BUT LITTLE OTHER BUSINESS WAS TRANSACTED BETWEEN THEM
AND THE GALLERIES SEEMED TO RUSTLE WITH THE SOUND OF THE MULTITUDE AND YET THERE WAS NOTHING AND DUCO AND CORNELIE WERE ALONE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE HUGE COLOSSAL RUIN HALF IN SHADOW AND HALF IN LIGHT AND
TO FIGURE AS A DEFEATED MAN BEFORE ALL THE WOMEN OF THE SETTLEMENT ABOVE ALL IN THE EYES OF HER HE ADORED DEFEATED BY ONE WHOM HE SUSPECTED OF BEING HIS RIVAL IN HER AFFECTIONS
DUKE OF SAN STEFANO WHO DINED AT BELLONI'S EVERY NIGHT AND CORNELIE SAW THAT A SORT OF CONSPIRACY WAS IN PROGRESS
AND CUNNINGLY CROSS QUESTIONED AS TO THE RELATIONS IN WHICH HE STOOD TOWARDS MAURICE THE MUSTANGER IN THAT FIRST INTERVIEW THE EX OFFICER VOLUNTEERS LEARNT ENOUGH
AND THAT IS HONEST TALK WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE FROM ME LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD SAID FOR MYSELF I WANT NOTHING AND AS A SOLDIER I MAY ASK NOTHING BUT FOR GENERAL MILES
NOTWITHSTANDING THE LUXURIOUS APPOINTMENTS THAT SURROUNDED HIM HE COULD NOT COMFORT HIMSELF WITH THE REFLECTION
LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD SAID CALMLY YOU ARE THE FRIEND OF NO WHITE MAN OR MEXICAN AS LONG AS YOU CONTINUE TO LIVE LIKE A WILD BEAST AND RAID AND KILL AT YOUR PLEASURE EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHO ARE WITH YOU NOW
CAPTAIN LAWTON AND HIS SOLDIERS MAY COME BUT THEY ARE TO STAY AHEAD OR BEHIND WE DO NOT CARE TO MINGLE WITH WHITE SOLDIERS
AND AS SOON AS HE HAD RECOVERED FROM THE APPREHENSIONS ENTERTAINED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF HIS LIFE HE COMMENCED REFLECTING UPON THIS VERY SUBJECT MAURICE THE MUSTANGER MUST DIE IF NOT BY HIS
AT THREE LIRE AN EVENING BUT AFTER A TIME SHE BOWED TO CORNELIE AGAIN WITH A BITTER SWEET LITTLE SMILE FOR SHE HAD RELET HER TWO ROOMS AT A HIGHER PRICE AND CORNELIE IN HER CALMER MOOD
IN THE SOLITUDE OF HIS SICK CHAMBER HE SET ABOUT MATURING HIS PLANS WHICH COMPREHENDED THE ASSASSINATION OF THE MUSTANGER HE DID NOT PURPOSE DOING THE DEED HIMSELF
AS THOUGH THE COLOSSEUM WERE HAUNTED BY ALL THE DEAD PAST OF ROME EMPERORS GLADIATORS AND MARTYRS SHADOWS PROWLED LIKE LURKING WILD ANIMALS A PATCH OF LIGHT SUGGESTED A NAKED WOMAN
AND WARM SPRINGS APACHES WERE IMPRISONED AT OLD FORT PICKENS OR AT FORT MARION IN FLORIDA EVENTUALLY THEY WERE MOVED TO A RESERVATION IN WHAT WAS THEN INDIAN TERRITORY
AS A GENERAL RULE THE MEN OF THIS PECULIAR CALLING ARE AMONGST THE GREATEST REPROBATES WHO HAVE THEIR HOME IN THE LAND OF THE LONE STAR BY BIRTH AND BREED THEY ARE MOSTLY MEXICANS OR MONGREL INDIANS
AND ONCE ASSURED OF RECOVERY ALL THE NATURAL SAVAGENESS OF HIS DISPOSITION WAS RESTORED ALONG WITH THE ADDITIONAL BITTERNESS ARISING FROM HIS RECENT DISCOMFITURE
WHY DO THEY CROSS OUR LINES WITH THEIR PETTY MOVEMENTS AND WHY ARE OURS NEVER CROSSED BY THOSE WHICH PERHAPS WOULD BE DEAREST TO OUR SOULS
THE OUTSIDE WORLD BUT KNEW THAT CAPTAIN CASSIUS CALHOUN AND MIGUEL DIAZ
LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD AND HIS PARTY RETURNED TO THEIR CAMP WHILE THE APACHES WENT TO THEIRS THE INDIANS WERE SOBER AND THOUGHTFUL IT IS TRUE GERONIMO SAID
ON THE LEFT ROSE THE RUINS OF THE IMPERIAL PALACES AND ALL AROUND THEM STOOD THE BLACK FRAGMENTS WITH A FEW PILLARS SOARING ON HIGH AND THE WHITE MOONLIGHT POURING DOWN
ALL THE VISITORS COMMENTED ON IT EVERY EYE WAS TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
IMPRISONMENT IN FLORIDA FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD SAID IS HE MAD
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CONSIDERED IT WAS NOT STRANGE THAT THE EX OFFICER OF VOLUNTEERS WHEN STRETCHED UPON A SICK BED RECEIVED LESS SYMPATHY FROM HIS RELATIVES
MEVROUW AND THE GIRLS AND DUCO TO THE DRAWING ROOM SAT DOWN IN A CORNER RESUMED HER CONVERSATION
THE NEPHEW BEING THE LATTER TO SUCH AN EXTENT HAD THIS INDEBTEDNESS BEEN CARRIED THAT CASSIUS CALHOUN WAS IN EFFECT THE REAL OWNER OF
AND WHEN ABROAD IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR CALLING THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS TO BE ENCOUNTERED WITH SAFETY
SHE DUMPED HERSELF DOWN WITH A RUSTLE ON THE SOFA BOBBED UP AND DOWN FOR A MOMENT ON THE SPRINGS LAID HER CROCHET WORK ON THE TABLE WITH A GESTURE AS THOUGH SHE WERE PLANTING THE UNION JACK IN A NEW COLONY AND SAID
EVEN THE APACHES HAVE TURNED AGAINST YOU FOR YOU HAVE GIVEN A BAD NAME TO APACHES WHO WOULD LIVE AT PEACE IT IS TRUE THAT MANY THIRST FOR MY BLOOD GERONIMO SAID THOUGHTFULLY
ONE EVENING AFTER DINNER HE SUGGESTED THAT THEY SHOULD ALL GO TO THE RUINS
ALL WERE DESPERATELY TIRED AND LONELY THEY HAD ENDURED FAR MORE THAN FLESH AND BLOOD SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO BEAR BUT THEY WERE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT
I FEAR TO SURRENDER EVEN MORE THAN I FEAR TO CONTINUE THE BATTLE MEXICANS SOUTH OF THE BORDER AND AMERICANS NORTH OF IT WOULD KILL US AS READILY AS WE WOULD KILL A PACK OF RABID WOLVES
TELL HIM THAT WE WILL RETURN TO ARIZONA IF WE MAY GO BACK TO OUR HOMES IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS AND IF WE MAY LIVE THERE AS WE DID BEFORE FLEEING INTO MEXICO THAT IS CHILDISH TALK GERONIMO
IT'S A SHAME THEY SAID ALOUD AND ANGULAR ARROGANT AND GRIMY THEY STALKED OUT THROUGH THE DOOR WHAT STRANGE PEOPLE THOUGHT DUCO SMILING SHADOWS OF PEOPLE
BUT THEY BOTH ENJOYED THIS MOMENT AND FELT AT ONE WITH EACH OTHER DUCO EVIDENTLY DID NOT GIVE A THOUGHT TO THE UNCONVENTIONALITY OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR BUT CORNELIE THOUGHT OF MISSUS VAN DER STAAL
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE VOWS OF VENGEANCE CALHOUN CHAFING IN HIS CHAMBER WAS NOT THE OBJECT OF SUCH ASSIDUOUS SOLICITUDE
THE ASTUTE MISSISSIPPIAN KNEW BETTER THAN TO DECLARE HIS ULTIMATE DESIGNS TO A STRANGER WHO AFTER COMPLETING AN ADVANTAGEOUS HORSE TRADE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH WHATEVER HE CHOSE TO DRINK
GLOWING WITH HER RED YOUNG HATRED AGAINST SOCIETY AND PEOPLE AND THE WORLD DINNER WAS OVER AND STILL EAGERLY TALKING SHE WENT WITH THE VAN DER STAALS
WHILE DREADING DEATH WHICH FOR A LENGTH OF TIME HE ACTUALLY DID HE HAD BECOME A LITTLE MORE AMIABLE TO THOSE AROUND HIM THE AGREEABLE MOOD HOWEVER WAS OF SHORT CONTINUANCE
AND THEY SAW THAT THE GUESTS WERE EVER AGAIN DIFFERENT AS IN A KALEIDOSCOPE OF FLEETING PERSONALITIES RUDYARD HAD DISAPPEARED OWING MONEY TO THE MARCHESA NO ONE KNEW WHITHER
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE THAT IS THE SECURING FOR HIS WIFE THE WOMAN HE HAD LONG FIERCELY LOVED HIS COUSIN LOUISE HE HAD COME TO KNOW THAT HE STOOD BUT LITTLE CHANCE OF OBTAINING HER CONSENT
AND SMILED AT THE THOUGHT OF HER HAGUE FRIENDS AND SHE LOOKED AT DUCO WHO SAT QUIETLY PLEASED TO BE SITTING WITH HER AND DRANK HIS COFFEE AND SPOKE A WORD NOW AND AGAIN OR POINTED TO A QUEER TYPE
AND THE JAEGERS WHO SAT READING AT THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM CLOSED THEIR TWO BOOKS WITH ONE SLAM ROSE AND INDIGNANTLY WENT AWAY BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AND TALKING IN THE DRAWING ROOM
BUT ESPECIALLY AGAINST MARRIAGE EVEN MARRIAGE WITH A PRINCE AND DUKE AND GROWING EXCITED SHE SPOKE TO MISSUS VAN DER STAAL AND THE GIRLS REPEATED PHRASES OUT OF HER PAMPHLET
WATCHING THE BUSTLE ON THE PAVEMENT OUTSIDE THEY EXCHANGED FEW WORDS DISTRACTED BY THE PASSERS BY AND THE VISITORS TO THE CAFE
THE MARCHESA HAD NOT BOWED TO HER AT FIRST THOUGH SHE SUFFERED HER TO ATTEND
AND WHAT IS NOW THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA THERE GERONIMO DIED AT FORT SILL ON FEBRUARY SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN O NINE WHETHER HE WAS A GREAT VILLAIN OR A GREAT PATRIOT
LIKE A GHOSTLY SEA OUT OF THE NIGHT THEY MET NO ONE BUT SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AND CLUNG TIGHTER TO HIS ARM WHEN THEY SAT DOWN FOR A MOMENT ON A FRAGMENT OF THE FOUNDATION OF SOME ANCIENT BUILDING
WHAT ONE OF THESE CHIEFS HAD KNOWN AND THE OTHER HAD LEARNED APACHES COULD NOT FIGHT THE WHITE MEN BUT NEITHER COULD THEY SURRENDER TO THEM UNLESS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO WORK OUT A PLAN
FELT TOWARDS HIM SOMETHING AKIN TO AVERSION MINGLED WITH A SUBDUED FEAR IT IS TRUE THAT THIS FEELING WAS ONLY OF RECENT ORIGIN AND ROSE OUT OF
IT IS EQUALLY TRUE THAT YOU STILL SPEAK WITH A STRAIGHT TONGUE SOME HAVE CALLED ME FRIEND AND WHEN THEY THOUGHT I WAS NO LONGER SUSPICIOUS HAVE TRIED TO BETRAY ME BUT YOU SAY AT ONCE THAT YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND
EX CAPTAIN AND THE INTENDED ACCOMPLICE IN HIS PURPOSES OF VENGEANCE ENOUGH ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE TO HAVE RENDERED THEM COMPLETE
SO ENDED THE FIGHTING DAYS OF GERONIMO THE LAST AND FIERCEST APACHE WAR CHIEF AND SO ALSO ENDED THE INDIAN WARS IN THE SOUTHWEST NEVER AGAIN WOULD MEN AND WOMEN ON LONELY RANCHES
HE HAD NO IDEA OF ENDURING IT AS AN ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE DONE IF HE COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM THE DISGRACE HE WAS DETERMINED TO REVENGE HIMSELF UPON ITS AUTHOR
WHEN FOR EVERY WHITE MAN IN ARIZONA THERE WERE A HUNDRED APACHES NOW FOR EVERY APACHE THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED WHITE MEN AND MORE TO COME YOU CANNOT KILL ALL THE SOLDIERS NOR CAN THEY KILL US
HIMSELF EXCEPTED WITH THESE DATA TO PROCEED UPON THE EX CAPTAIN HAD CALLED THE MEXICAN TO HIS COUNSELS AND THE TWO WERE OFTEN CLOSETED TOGETHER IN THE CHAMBER OF THE INVALID
AND DELIGHTED IN THE ROMANCE CORNELIE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS NOT AMUSED SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO WARN URANIA AGAINST THE MARCHESA THE PRINCE AND THE MONSIGNORI WHO HAD TAKEN RUDYARD'S PLACE
THERE COULD NOT BE MUCH DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING A CONFEDERATE
GERONIMO SAID YOUR FACE IS PALE AND DRAWN AS THOUGH IT HAS NOT SEEN THE SUN IN TOO MANY DAYS OR PERHAPS YOU HAVE BEEN ILL IT IS NOTHING SAID LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD
CAPTAIN LAWTON AND A COMPANY OF SOLDIERS ARE CAMPED NOT FAR AWAY I WILL ASK THEM TO MARCH WITH YOU AND HELP BEAT OFF ANY MEXICANS
THEY WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH THE SILENT DESERTED STREETS SOMETIMES IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING BUT SOMETIMES IT WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER AND THEN THEY WOULD GO THROUGH THE CORSO
THERE WAS NOTHING IN ALL THIS TO EXCITE SUSPICION EVEN HAD CALHOUN CARED FOR THAT HIS VISITOR WAS A DEALER IN HORSES AND HORNED CATTLE SOME TRANSACTION IN HORSEFLESH MIGHT BE GOING ON BETWEEN THEM
AND NORTHERN MEXICO FIND IT NECESSARY TO TRAVEL IN GROUPS AND WELL ARMED FOR FEAR OF APACHE ATTACKS GERONIMO AND HIS FOLLOWERS AS WELL AS MANY OTHER
WHEN SPEAKING OF HIS ANTAGONIST CALHOUN HAD DRAWN THE DEDUCTION THAT THE MEXICAN WAS NO FRIEND TO MAURICE THE MUSTANGER SINCE THEN HE HAD LEARNT THAT HE WAS MAURICE'S DEADLIEST ENEMY
AS HE LISTENED TO HIS EXPLANATIONS ONLY HOPED IN HIS HEART THAT THE DAMSEL WHO HAD SLIGHTED HIM MIGHT HAVE WON THE HEART OF HIS RIVAL DURING HIS DAYS OF CONVALESCENCE SEVERAL INTERVIEWS HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THE
HE HAD BECOME TOO MUCH ENCOWARDISED TO PLAY THE ASSASSIN HE WANTED AN ACCOMPLICE AN ARM TO STRIKE FOR HIM WHERE WAS HE TO FIND IT UNLUCKILY HE KNEW OR FANCIED HE KNEW THE VERY MAN
BY WHITE SOLDIERS DOES YOUR GENERAL MILES NOT KNOW THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF CARRYING ON THE FIGHT HE KNOWS LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD SAID
ONE OF THIS KIDNEY WAS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD BECOME RECALLED TO THE MEMORY OF CASSIUS CALHOUN THE LATTER REMEMBERED HAVING MET THE MAN IN THE BAR ROOM OF THE HOTEL
CERTAIN RELATIONS THAT EXISTED BETWEEN UNCLE AND NEPHEW AS ALREADY HINTED THEY STOOD TO ONE ANOTHER IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF
AMONG HER FRIENDS AND SHE SMILED AS SHE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE HAD SAID AND HOW HE HAD SAID IT AND HOW HE COULD SIT QUIETLY SILENT FOR MINUTES ON END WITH A SMILE ABOUT HIS LIPS AS THOUGH THINKING OF SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL
AND HE WOULD GENERALLY ASK HER TO COME AND SIT AT ARAGNO'S FOR A LITTLE
STRIKING A MATCH TO SEE HER WAY UP THE DARK STAIRCASE ONCE IN HER ROOM SHE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO WANDER ABOUT THE RUINS AT NIGHT SHE REFLECTED HOW LITTLE
THOUGH NOT UNFREQUENTLY A FRENCHMAN OR AMERICAN FINDS IT A CONGENIAL CALLING THEY ARE USUALLY THE OUTCASTS OF CIVILISED SOCIETY OFTENER ITS OUTLAWS WHO
AND SPIN ROUND LIKE A SILVER WHEEL HE SAID NOTHING HE WAS IN ONE OF HIS DREAMS SEEING THE PAST BEFORE HIM AND SILENTLY THEY WENT AWAY AND HE LED HER THROUGH THE ARCH OF TITUS INTO THE FORUM
THERE WAS OLD MANGUS COLORADUS ADVISING HIS PEOPLE TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE WHITE MEN SINCE THEY COULD NEVER HOPE TO CONQUER THEM
FOUND IT PLEASANT TO CHANGE IN THE EVENING TO SEE MISSUS VAN DER STAAL AND THE GIRLS TO LISTEN TO THEIR LITTLE STORIES ABOUT THE ROMAN SALONS AND TO CAST A GLANCE OVER THE LONG TABLES
LAYING SIEGE TO THE VAIN LITTLE AMERICAN FROM EITHER SIDE AND NEXT DAY SHE SAW TWO MONSIGNORI SEATED IN EAGER CONVERSATION WITH URANIA AT THE MARCHESA'S TABLE
OR IN ISOLATED VILLAGES AWAKEN TREMBLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO HEAR THE POUND OF PONIES HOOFS AND THE WILD APACHE WAR CRY NEVER AGAIN WOULD TRAVELERS IN ARIZONA NEW MEXICO
IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES AGAIN
BUT IF YOU FAIL TO SURRENDER GENERAL MILES HAS ANOTHER OFFER HE WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND KILL EVERY ONE OF YOU IF IT TAKES ANOTHER FIFTY YEARS TAKE A MESSAGE TO YOUR GENERAL MILES GERONIMO SAID
THEY HAVE BEEN SENT TO FLORIDA WITH THE REST BUT BOTH INQUIRED ABOUT YOU
GERONIMO SEARCHED THE OFFICER'S FACE FOR SOME SIGN OF FEAR BUT THERE WAS NOT EVEN A SLIGHT NERVOUSNESS LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD WAS INDEED WORTHY OF HIS REPUTATION FOR BOTH COURAGE AND GALLANTRY
AND THEN SUDDENLY SAW A FAT LADY THE GIRLS HAD ALREADY NICK NAMED HER THE SATIN FRIGATE COME TOWARDS HER WITH A SMILE AND SAY WHILE STILL AT SOME DISTANCE I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SAY
THOUGH SHE WAS NOT AFRAID SHE WAS OBSESSED BY THAT AWFUL HAUNTING OF THE PAST AND PUSHED CLOSER TO HIM AND CLUTCHED HIS ARM AND FELT VERY VERY SMALL HE JUST PRESSED HER HAND WITH HIS SIMPLE EASE OF MANNER
DEPENDS ON WHETHER ONE LOOKS AT HIM WITH THE EYES OF THE WHITE MEN WHOM HE PLUNDERED OR THE APACHES WHOM HE CHAMPIONED
THE MASTER OF EVERY CROWD THAT MIGHT GATHER AROUND HIM HE COULD NO LONGER CLAIM THIS CREDIT IN TEXAS AND THE THOUGHT HARROWED HIS HEART TO ITS VERY CORE
TO TEACH HIM WHAT MANGUS COLORADUS HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY HIS OWN WISDOM NOW ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF MANGUS COLORADUS GERONIMO FINALLY UNDERSTOOD
TRULY SELFISH IN HIS OWN HEART HE HAD NO FAITH IN FRIENDSHIPS AND WHILE CONFINED TO HIS COUCH NOT WITHOUT SOME FEARS THAT IT MIGHT BE HIS DEATH BED
HIS LATE DEFEAT HAD RENDERED HIM FEARFUL OF CHANCING A SECOND ENCOUNTER WITH THE SAME ADVERSARY EVEN UNDER THE ADVANTAGEOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SURPRISE
HE DID NOT DECLARE THE EXACT CAUSE OF IT BUT CALHOUN COULD GUESS BY CERTAIN INNUENDOS INTRODUCED DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT IT WAS THE SAME AS THAT BY WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ACTUATED
THE SAME TO WHICH MAY BE TRACED ALMOST EVERY QUARREL THAT HAS OCCURRED AMONG MEN FROM TROY TO TEXAS A WOMAN THE HELEN IN THIS CASE APPEARED TO BE SOME DARK EYED DONCELLA
SHE SHIVERED WITH COLD HE STARTED UP SAID THAT SHE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO CATCH A CHILL AND THEY WALKED ON AND LEFT THE FORUM HE TOOK HER HOME AND SHE WENT UPSTAIRS ALONE
WHILE DWELLING WITHIN THE SETTLEMENTS THESE MEN ARE NOT UNFREQUENTLY THE PESTS OF THE SOCIETY THAT SURROUNDS THEM
THE VON ROTHKIRCHES HAD GONE TO GREECE BUT URANIA HOPE WAS STILL THERE AND SAT NEXT TO THE MARCHESA BELLONI ON HER OTHER SIDE WAS THE NEPHEW THE PRINCE OF FORTE
WHERE GENERAL MILES AWAITS AND THIS IS ENEMY COUNTRY WE WILL NOT SURRENDER OUR ARMS UNTIL WE ARE MET BY GENERAL MILES THAT IS AGREEABLE SAID LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD IN ADDITION
AT THE GREAT APACHE LEADER GERONIMO AND HIS WARRIORS LAID DOWN THE ARMS THAT THEY HAD CARRIED SO MANY MILES AND INTO SO MANY BATTLES THE DISARMED APACHES WERE SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS
GERONIMO SAID MY TERMS STAND WE RETURN TO THE WHITE MOUNTAINS AND LIVE AS WE ONCE LIVED OR WE CONTINUE THE WAR LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD
TO REASSURE HER AND THE NIGHT OPPRESSED HER THE GHOSTLINESS OF IT ALL SUFFOCATED HER THE MOON SEEMED TO WHIRL GIDDILY IN THE SKY AND TO EXPAND TO A GIGANTIC SIZE
SHE FELL ASLEEP AFTER A CHAOS OF WHIRLING THOUGHTS THE PRINCE AND URANIA THE FAT SATIN LADY THE COLOSSEUM AND THE MARTYRS AND DUCO AND MISSUS VAN DER STAAL HIS MOTHER WAS SO ORDINARY
DUCO HAD SPOKEN NOT THINKING OF DANGER LOST IN HIS NOCTURNAL DREAM PEERING INTO THE AWFUL GHOSTLINESS WHY WHY HAD HE NOT GONE ALONE WHY HAD HE ASKED HER TO GO WITH HIM
WHAT WOULD YOU DO TRUST GENERAL MILES AND SURRENDER TO HIM LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD SAID PROMPTLY SO YOU HAVE SPOKEN AND SO SHALL WE DO SAID GERONIMO BUT IT IS A LONG WAY TO THE BORDER
WHERE MAURICE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF MAKING AN OCCASIONAL VISIT IN WHOSE EYES HE HAD FOUND FAVOUR TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF HER OWN CONPAISANO THE MEXICAN DID NOT GIVE THE NAME AND CALHOUN
NEVERTHELESS CORNELIE RECOVERED HER CALMNESS WHEN HER PAMPHLET WAS FINISHED SHE UNPACKED HER TRUNKS ARRANGED HER ROOMS A LITTLE MORE SNUGLY AND NOW MORE AT HER EASE REWROTE THE PAMPHLET AND
HIS SISTERS CHARMING BUT COMMONPLACE AND HE SO STRANGE SO SIMPLE SO UNAFFECTED SO UNRESERVED AND FOR THAT VERY REASON SO STRANGE HE WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AT THE HAGUE
IT IS WINTER THAT IS JUST AHEAD GERONIMO DO I HAVE YOUR FINAL ANSWER GERONIMO SAID MAY WE TALK AGAIN TOMORROW WE MAY SAID LIEUTENANT GATEWOOD THEY PARTED
TO KNOW THAT HE MIGHT DEPEND UPON HIS MAN FOR ANY SERVICE HE MIGHT REQUIRE EVEN TO THE COMMITTAL OF MURDER THE MEXICAN MADE NO SECRET OF HIS HEARTFELT HOSTILITY TO THE YOUNG MUSTANGER
CALHOUN POSSESSED GOLD MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR SUCH A PURPOSE
IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CHASE AND ITS CONCOMITANT DANGERS FIND PERHAPS SOME SORT OF SALVO FOR A CONSCIENCE THAT HAS BEEN SEVERELY TRIED
FOR SHE HAD TAKEN BUT SLIGHT PAINS TO CONCEAL HER INDIFFERENCE TO HIS SUIT TRUSTING TO THE PECULIAR INFLUENCE ESTABLISHED OVER HER FATHER HE HAD DETERMINED ON TAKING NO SLIGHT DENIAL
LOOK HERE I HAVE BEEN TO BELLONI'S REGULARLY EVERY WINTER FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS FROM NOVEMBER TO EASTER AND EVERY EVENING AFTER DINNER BUT ONLY AFTER DINNER I SIT IN THIS CORNER AT THIS TABLE
WE HAVE FOUGHT AND FOUGHT WELL BUT WE ARE VERY FEW AND OUR ENEMIES ARE VERY MANY WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO FIGHT THEM FOREVER
WITH HER MOST AMIABLE SMILE VERY MUCH OBLIGED SO MANY THANKS DUCO ROARED THE GIRLS GIGGLED BUT THE SATIN FRIGATE MERELY NODDED TO THEM GOOD HUMOUREDLY AND
A MORE NAMELESS ADVENTURER WAS TOO MUCH TO BE ENDURED WITH EQUANIMITY EVEN AN ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PAINED BY THE INFLICTION
WHETHER THEY WERE SO OR NOT AND WHAT THE NATURE OF THEIR HELLISH DESIGNS WERE THINGS KNOWN ONLY TO THE BRACE OF KINDRED CONFEDERATES
EXPECTATION WAS NO LONGER ALIVE ROMOLA HAD THROWN ASIDE HER VEIL AND PAUSED A MOMENT HOLDING THE NECKLACE IN SIGHT THEN SHE SAID IN THAT PURE VOICE THAT USED TO CHEER HER FATHER TESSA TESSA STARTED TO HER FEET AND LOOKED ROUND
AND THAT MIGHT MAKE IT WELL THAT HE SHOULD NOT SEE HER AGAIN YET IT WAS A TRIFLING ADVENTURE SUCH AS A COUNTRY GIRL WOULD PERHAPS PONDER ON TILL SOME RUDDY CONTADINO MADE ACCEPTABLE LOVE TO HER WHEN SHE WOULD BREAK HER RESOLUTION OF SECRECY AND GET AT THE TRUTH THAT SHE WAS FREE
OR SHOULD HE LEAVE THE DISCLOSURE TO TIME AND CHANCE HAPPY DREAMS ARE PLEASANT AND THEY EASILY COME TO AN END WITH DAYLIGHT AND THE STIR OF LIFE THE SWEET POUTING INNOCENT ROUND THING
SHE NEEDED SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS BOUND SPECIALLY TO CARE FOR SHE YEARNED TO CLASP THE CHILDREN AND TO MAKE THEM LOVE HER THIS AT LEAST WOULD BE SOME SWEET RESULT FOR OTHERS AS WELL AS HERSELF FROM ALL HER PAST SORROW
AGREEING RATHER WITH A HOMERIC SENTIMENT ON THAT HEAD WHICH FURNISHED A GREEK QUOTATION TO SERVE AS POWDER TO HIS BULLET THE QUARREL COULD NOT END THERE THE LOGIC COULD HARDLY GET WORSE BUT THE SECRETARY GOT MORE POMPOUSLY SELF ASSERTING AND THE SCHOLARLY POET'S TEMPER MORE AND MORE VENOMOUS
LEOPARDS AND TIGERS MUST BE CROUCHING BEFORE HIM AND DOLPHINS MUST BE SPORTING ROUND BUT I WANT TO HAVE THE FAIR HAIRED ARIADNE WITH HIM MADE IMMORTAL WITH HER GOLDEN CROWN THAT IS NOT IN OVID'S STORY BUT NO MATTER YOU WILL CONCEIVE IT ALL
OVERLOOKING THE SPACIOUS GARDENS AND LAWN AT THE BACK OF HIS PALACE HE WAS IN THIS POSITION ON THE DAY WHEN HE HAD GRANTED THE DESIRED INTERVIEW TO TITO MELEMA
WHY FRA GIROLAMO SAID AS GOOD AS THAT WIDOWS OUGHT NOT TO MARRY AGAIN STEP IN AT THE DOOR AND IT'S A SIN AND A SHAME IT SEEMS BUT COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND YOU'RE WELCOME TWO CHILDREN SANTIDDIO COUSIN
THAT IS THE THING I SHALL DO FIRST OF ALL WELL SAID MONNA BRIGIDA SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS AND LOWERING HER VOICE WITH AN AIR OF PUZZLED DISCOMFITURE IF THAT'S BEING A PIAGNONE I'VE BEEN TAKING PEAS FOR PATERNOSTERS
BARTOLOMMEO SCALA SECRETARY OF THE FLORENTINE REPUBLIC ON WHOM TITO MELEMA HAD BEEN THUS LED TO ANCHOR HIS HOPES LIVED IN A HANDSOME PALACE CLOSE TO THE PORTA PINTI NOW KNOWN AS THE CASA GHERARDESCA
AND HE COULD TELL HER WHAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN IN FLORENCE THAT TITO HAD ESCAPED FROM AN ASSAULTING MOB BY LEAPING INTO THE ARNO BUT HAD BEEN MURDERED ON THE BANK BY AN OLD MAN WHO HAD LONG HAD AN ENMITY AGAINST HIM BUT ROMOLA UNDERSTOOD THE CATASTROPHE AS NO ONE ELSE DID
TITO RATHER ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR A SUDDEN SENSITIVENESS STRANGELY OPPOSED TO HIS USUAL EASY SELF COMMAND SAID CARELESSLY
HE ADDED LOOKING DOWN INTO TITO'S FACE TITO LAUGHED AND BLUSHED
THERE IT IS I WANT HER TO SIT TO ME GIOVANNI VESPUCCI WANTS ME TO PAINT HIM A PICTURE OF OEDIPUS AND ANTIGONE AT COLONOS AS HE HAS EXPOUNDED IT TO ME I HAVE A FANCY FOR THE SUBJECT AND I WANT BARDO AND HIS DAUGHTER TO SIT FOR IT NOW YOU ASK THEM
BUT WHEN WAS THE FATAL COQUETRY INHERENT IN SUPERFLUOUS AUTHORSHIP EVER QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE READY PRAISE OF FRIENDS THAT CRITICAL SUPERCILIOUS POLITIAN A FELLOW BROWSER WHO WAS FAR FROM AMIABLE
HAD A FEW LITTLE MATTERS IN THE SHAPE OF SONNETS TURNING ON WELL KNOWN FOIBLES OF POLITIAN'S WHICH HE WOULD NOT LIKE TO GO ANY FARTHER BUT WHICH WOULD PERHAPS AMUSE THE COMPANY ENOUGH
AND HAD EIGHT YEARS AGO BEEN GONFALONIERE LAST GOAL OF THE FLORENTINE CITIZEN'S AMBITION MEANTIME HE HAD GOT RICHER AND RICHER AND MORE AND MORE GOUTY AFTER THE MANNER OF SUCCESSFUL MORTALITY AND THE KNIGHT OF THE GOLDEN SPUR HAD OFTEN TO SIT WITH HELPLESS CUSHIONED HEEL
SAINT MARGARET'S RESURRECTION OUT OF THE DEVOURING DRAGON MADONNAS WITH THE SUPERNAL LIGHT UPON THEM STUDIES OF PLANTS AND GROTESQUE HEADS AND ON IRREGULAR ROUGH SHELVES A FEW BOOKS WERE SCATTERED AMONG GREAT DROOPING BUNCHES OF CORN BULLOCKS HORNS PIECES OF DRIED HONEYCOMB
AND INTENDED AS AN AGREEABLE DISTRACTION DURING THE SUMMER HEAT TO HIMSELF AND SUCH FRIENDS AS WERE SATISFIED WITH MEDIOCRITY HE SCALA NOT BEING LIKE SOME OTHER PEOPLE WHO COURTED PUBLICITY THROUGH THE BOOKSELLERS FOR THE REST
STONES WITH PATCHES OF RARE COLOURED LICHEN SKULLS AND BONES PEACOCKS FEATHERS AND LARGE BIRDS WINGS RISING FROM AMONGST THE DIRTY LITTER OF THE FLOOR WERE LAY FIGURES ONE IN THE FROCK OF A VALLOMBROSAN MONK STRANGELY SURMOUNTED BY A HELMET WITH BARRED VISOR
SEE SAID ROMOLA CLASPING THE BEADS ON TESSA'S NECK GOD HAS SENT ME TO YOU AGAIN THE POOR THING SCREAMED AND SOBBED AND CLUNG TO THE ARMS THAT FASTENED THE NECKLACE SHE COULD NOT SPEAK
AND WHAT MAY THAT NEED BE HE SAID AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE IN HIS HEART HE WAS TEMPTED BY THE HINTED OPPORTUNITY OF APPLYING HIS INVENTION I WANT A VERY DELICATE MINIATURE DEVICE TAKEN FROM CERTAIN FABLES OF THE POETS WHICH YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO COMBINE FOR ME
FROM A LITTLE WOMAN NAMED TESSA IS IT NOT TRUE AH IF YOU KNOW HER SAID BRATTI AND WOULD REDEEM IT OF ME AT A SMALL PROFIT AND GIVE IT HER AGAIN YOU'D BE DOING A CHARITY FOR SHE CRIED AT PARTING WITH IT YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS RUNNING INTO A BROOK
AND WITH THIS THOUGHT IN HIS MIND HE WENT TO THE VIA GUALFONDA TO FIND PIERO DI COSIMO THE ARTIST WHO AT THAT TIME WAS PRE EMINENT IN THE FANTASTIC MYTHOLOGICAL DESIGN WHICH TITO'S PURPOSE REQUIRED
OR INDEED WHEN THE DARKNESS WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION A BAT OR AN OWL WERE A LESS OBSCURE AND MORE APPOSITE PARALLEL ETCETERA ETCETERA HERE WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR POLITIAN HE WAS NOT AWARE HE WROTE
SHE MONNA BRIGIDA MUST REAR THEM TOO ONLY THEY MUST BE FOUND FIRST ROMOLA FELT THE FULL FORCE OF THAT INNUENDO BUT STRONG FEELING UNSATISFIED IS NEVER WITHOUT ITS SUPERSTITION EITHER OF HOPE OR DESPAIR ROMOLA'S WAS THE SUPERSTITION OF HOPE
PIERO TOOK THE COIN OUT OF THE LEATHERN SCARSELLA AT HIS BELT AND THE LITTLE MAIDEN TROTTED AWAY NOT WITHOUT A FEW UPWARD GLANCES OF AWED ADMIRATION AT THE SURPRISING YOUNG SIGNOR PIERO'S GLANCE WAS MUCH LESS COMPLIMENTARY AS HE SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT AT MY DOOR MESSER GRECO
FOR THE DOUBLE DOOR UNDERNEATH THE WINDOW WHICH ADMITTED THE PAINTER'S LIGHT FROM ABOVE WAS THROWN OPEN AND SHOWED A GARDEN OR RATHER THICKET IN WHICH FIG TREES AND VINES GREW IN TANGLED TRAILING WILDNESS AMONG NETTLES AND HEMLOCKS
AND A TALL CYPRESS LIFTED ITS DARK HEAD FROM A STIFLING MASS OF YELLOWISH MULBERRY LEAVES IT SEEMED AS IF THAT DANK LUXURIANCE HAD BEGUN TO PENETRATE EVEN WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE WIDE AND LOFTY ROOM FOR IN ONE CORNER AMIDST A CONFUSED HEAP OF CARVED MARBLE FRAGMENTS AND RUSTY ARMOUR
IT MUST BE PAINTED ON A WOODEN CASE I WILL SHOW YOU THE SIZE IN THE FORM OF A TRIPTYCH THE INSIDE MAY BE SIMPLE GILDING IT IS ON THE OUTSIDE I WANT THE DEVICE IT IS A FAVOURITE SUBJECT WITH YOU FLORENTINES THE TRIUMPH OF BACCHUS AND ARIADNE BUT I WANT IT TREATED IN A NEW WAY
BUT SINCE THAT WAS THE REASON YOU WENT NO DEAR COUSIN SAID ROMOLA INTERRUPTING HER EARNESTLY PRAY DO NOT TALK SO I WISH ABOVE ALL THINGS TO FIND THAT YOUNG WOMAN AND HER CHILDREN AND TO TAKE CARE OF THEM THEY ARE QUITE HELPLESS SAY NOTHING AGAINST IT
TITO HAD MADE UP HIS MIND WHAT TO DO WITH SOME OF THEM HE WOULD CARRY OUT A PRETTY INGENIOUS THOUGHT WHICH WOULD SET HIM MORE AT EASE IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE ABSENCE OF HIS RING TO ROMOLA AND WOULD ALSO SERVE HIM AS A MEANS OF GUARDING HER MIND FROM THE RECURRENCE OF THOSE MONKISH FANCIES WHICH WERE ESPECIALLY REPUGNANT TO HIM
AND BETOOK HIMSELF FIRST TO TAPPING MODESTLY WITH HIS KNUCKLES AND THEN TO A MORE IMPORTUNATE ATTEMPT TO SHAKE THE DOOR IN RAIN
THE TWO CHILDREN CAME FROM THEIR CORNER LAID HOLD OF THEIR MOTHER'S SKIRTS AND LOOKED UP WITH WIDE EYES AT ROMOLA THAT DAY THEY ALL WENT HOME TO MONNA BRIGIDA'S IN THE BORGO DEGLI ALBIZZI ROMOLA HAD MADE KNOWN TO TESSA BY GENTLE DEGREES
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO TITO'S APPOINTED VISIT THAT THE PAPERS CONTAINING THIS CORRESPONDENCE WERE BROUGHT OUT TO DAY HERE WAS A NEW GREEK SCHOLAR WHOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE TO BE TESTED AND ON NOTHING DID SCALA MORE DESIRE A DISPASSIONATE OPINION FROM PERSONS OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
HIS ARMS AN AZURE LADDER TRANSVERSE ON A GOLDEN FIELD WITH THE MOTTO GRADATIM PLACED OVER THE ENTRANCE TOLD ALL COMERS THAT THE MILLER'S SON HELD HIS ASCENT TO HONOURS BY HIS OWN EFFORTS
BUT IT WAS AS SHE HAD FEARED TESSA WAS GONE ROMOLA CONJECTURED THAT TITO HAD SENT HER AWAY BEFOREHAND TO SOME SPOT WHERE HE HAD INTENDED TO JOIN HER FOR SHE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD WILLINGLY PART WITH THOSE CHILDREN IT WAS A PAINFUL CONJECTURE BECAUSE
IF TESSA WERE OUT OF FLORENCE THERE WAS HARDLY A CHANCE OF FINDING HER AND ROMOLA PICTURED THE CHILDISH CREATURE WAITING AND WAITING AT SOME WAYSIDE SPOT IN WONDERING HELPLESS MISERY THOSE WHO LIVED NEAR COULD TELL HER NOTHING EXCEPT THAT OLD DEAF LISA
A STORY IN OVID WILL GIVE YOU THE NECESSARY HINTS THE YOUNG BACCHUS MUST BE SEATED IN A SHIP HIS HEAD BOUND WITH CLUSTERS OF GRAPES AND A SPEAR ENTWINED WITH VINE LEAVES IN HIS HAND
HAD GONE AWAY A WEEK AGO WITH HER GOODS BUT NO ONE KNEW WHERE TESSA HAD GONE ROMOLA SAW NO FURTHER ACTIVE SEARCH OPEN TO HER FOR SHE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THAT COULD SERVE AS A STARTING POINT FOR INQUIRY
WHO WAS HURT BY IT THE RESULTS TO BALDASSARRE WERE TOO PROBLEMATICAL TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BUT HE WANTED NOW TO BE FREE FROM ANY HIDDEN SHACKLES THAT WOULD GALL HIM THOUGH EVER SO LITTLE UNDER HIS TIES TO ROMOLA HE WAS NOT AWARE
THREE CORPULENT TOADS WERE CRAWLING IN AN INTIMATE FRIENDLY WAY NEAR THE DOOR STONE AND A WHITE RABBIT APPARENTLY THE MODEL FOR THAT WHICH WAS FRIGHTENING CUPID IN THE PICTURE OF MARS AND VENUS PLACED ON THE CENTRAL EASEL WAS TWITCHING ITS NOSE WITH MUCH CONTENT ON A BOX FULL OF BRAN
BUT THEN O BEAUTIFUL BALANCE OF THINGS HE HAD AN ITCH FOR AUTHORSHIP AND WAS A BAD WRITER ONE OF THOSE EXCELLENT PEOPLE WHO SITTING IN GOUTY SLIPPERS PENNED POETICAL TRIFLES ENTIRELY FOR THEIR OWN AMUSEMENT WITHOUT ANY VIEW TO AN AUDIENCE
AND TITO WHO HAD JUST BEEN LOOKING INTO THE MISCELLANEA FOUND SO MUCH TO SAY THAT WAS AGREEABLE TO THE SECRETARY
THE REST OF THE PICTURE IS HARDLY SKETCHED BUT I'VE PAINTED YOU IN THOROUGHLY
WRETCHED CAVILS INDEED FOR AS TO THE DAMP ORIGIN OF THE GNAT THERE WAS THE AUTHORITY OF VIRGIL HIMSELF WHO HAD CALLED IT THE ALUMNUS OF THE WATERS AND AS TO WHAT HIS DEAR DULL FRIEND HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE FISH THE EAGLE AND THE REST
PIERO MADE A GRIMACE WHICH WAS HABITUAL WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS SPOKEN TO WITH FLATTERING SUAVITY HE GRINNED STRETCHED OUT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH AND PRESSED DOWN HIS BROWS SO AS TO DEFY ANY DIVINATION OF HIS FEELINGS UNDER THAT KIND OF STROKING
HE WAS ASHAMED HOWEVER TO DWELL ON SUCH TRIVIALITIES AND THUS TO SWELL A GNAT INTO AN ELEPHANT BUT FOR HIS OWN PART WOULD ONLY ADD THAT HE HAD NOTHING DECEITFUL OR DOUBLE ABOUT HIM NEITHER WAS HE TO BE CAUGHT WHEN PRESENT BY THE FALSE BLANDISHMENTS OF THOSE WHO SLANDERED HIM IN HIS ABSENCE
I BEGIN TO THINK YOU ARE A CYNIC PHILOSOPHER IN THE PLEASANT DISGUISE OF A CUNNING PAINTER NOT I MESSER GRECO A PHILOSOPHER IS THE LAST SORT OF ANIMAL I SHOULD CHOOSE TO RESEMBLE I FIND IT ENOUGH TO LIVE WITHOUT SPINNING LIES TO ACCOUNT FOR LIFE
POLITIAN FOUND THE VERSES VERY PRETTY AND HIGHLY FACETIOUS THE MORE WAS THE PITY THAT THEY WERE SERIOUSLY INCORRECT AND INASMUCH AS SCALA HAD ALLEGED THAT HE HAD WRITTEN THEM IN IMITATION OF A GREEK EPIGRAM POLITIAN BEING ON SUCH FRIENDLY TERMS
BUT IF I'M TO HAVE THIS PUSS FACED MINX LIVING IN MY HOUSE SHE MUST BE HUMBLE TO ME
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO THINK OF HER TITO THOUGHT HE SHOULD LIKE SOME TIME TO TAKE HER A PRESENT THAT WOULD PLEASE HER AND JUST LEARN IF HER STEP FATHER TREATED HER MORE CRUELLY NOW HER MOTHER WAS DEAD
CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND POLITIAN IT WAS A HUMAN FOIBLE AT THAT PERIOD INCREDIBLE AS IT MAY SEEM TO RECITE QUARRELS AND FAVOUR SCHOLARLY VISITORS WITH THE COMMUNICATION OF AN ENTIRE AND LENGTHY CORRESPONDENCE
AND WRITING LETTERS TO HIS ELDERS WITHOUT SIGNING THEM AS IF THEY WERE MIRACULOUS REVELATIONS THAT COULD ONLY HAVE ONE SOURCE AND AFTER ALL WERE NOT HIS OWN CRITICISMS OFTEN QUESTIONABLE AND HIS TASTES PERVERSE
MUST BE MADE AWARE THAT THE SOLID SECRETARY SHOWED IN HIS LEISURE HOURS A PLEASANT FERTILITY IN VERSES WHICH INDICATED PRETTY CLEARLY HOW MUCH HE MIGHT DO IN THAT WAY IF HE WERE NOT A MAN OF AFFAIRS INEFFABLE MOMENT WHEN THE MAN YOU SECRETLY HATE SENDS YOU A LATIN EPIGRAM WITH A FALSE GENDER
HAD LONG SINCE MADE HIS ORATIONS ON THE RINGHIERA
SOMEHOW SHE WAS TO FIND THAT MOTHER AND THE CHILDREN AND AT LAST ANOTHER DIRECTION FOR ACTIVE INQUIRY SUGGESTED ITSELF SHE LEARNED THAT TITO HAD PROVIDED HORSES AND MULES TO AWAIT HIM IN SAN GALLO HE WAS THEREFORE GOING TO LEAVE FLORENCE BY THE GATE OF SAN GALLO
TITO FOUND THE HEAVY IRON KNOCKER ON THE DOOR THICKLY BOUND ROUND WITH WOOL AND INGENIOUSLY FASTENED WITH CORDS REMEMBERING THE PAINTER'S PRACTICE OF STUFFING HIS EARS AGAINST OBTRUSIVE NOISES TITO WAS NOT MUCH SURPRISED AT THIS MODE OF DEFENCE AGAINST VISITORS THUNDER
HER CRYING HAD PASSED INTO TEARLESS SOBS AND SHE WAS LOOKING WITH SAD BLANK EYES AT THE TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE PLAYING IN AN OPPOSITE CORNER LILLO COVERING HIS HEAD WITH HIS SKIRT AND ROARING AT NINNA TO FRIGHTEN HER THEN PEEPING OUT AGAIN TO SEE HOW SHE BORE IT
I REMEMBERED NOTHING BUT YOUR ADMIRABLE SKILL IN INVENTING PRETTY CAPRICES WHEN A SUDDEN DESIRE FOR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT PROMPTED ME TO COME TO YOU
WHO EXCELLENT MAN NOT SEEKING PUBLICITY THROUGH THE BOOKSELLERS WAS NEVER UNPROVIDED WITH HASTY UNCORRECTED TRIFLES AS A SORT OF SHERBET FOR A VISITOR ON A HOT DAY OR IF THE WEATHER WERE COLD WHY THEN AS A CORDIAL
ANOTHER SMOTHERED WITH BROCADE AND SKINS HASTILY TOSSED OVER IT AMONGST THIS HETEROGENEOUS STILL LIFE SEVERAL SPECKLED AND WHITE PIGEONS WERE PERCHED OR STRUTTING TOO TAME TO FLY AT THE ENTRANCE OF MEN
AND SINCE NO ENLIGHTENMENT COULD EXPEL IT FROM TESSA'S MIND THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A RISK OF BETRAYAL BESIDES EVEN LITTLE TESSA MIGHT HAVE SOME GALL IN HER WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF DISAPPOINTED IN HER LOVE YES SHE MUST BE A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
AND SHE DETERMINED THOUGH WITHOUT MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE ISSUE TO TRY AND ASCERTAIN FROM THE GATEKEEPERS IF THEY HAD OBSERVED ANY ONE CORRESPONDING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF TESSA WITH HER CHILDREN TO HAVE PASSED THE GATES BEFORE THE MORNING OF THE NINTH OF APRIL
HE SAW HIMSELF WITH HIS RIGHT HAND UPLIFTED HOLDING A WINE CUP IN THE ATTITUDE OF TRIUMPHANT JOY
BUT EVEN IF TITO HAD SUSPECTED ANY OFFENSIVE INTENTION
TO TRY AND SEE SAVONAROLA AND TO LEARN WHAT HAD BECOME OF TESSA AND THE CHILDREN TELL ME COUSIN SHE SAID ABRUPTLY WHEN MONNA BRIGIDA'S TONGUE HAD RUN QUITE AWAY FROM TROUBLES INTO PROJECTS OF ROMOLA'S LIVING WITH HER
GOOD BYE TESSA KINDEST WISHES TITO HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THE SILLY LITTLE AFFAIR OF THE CERRETANO SHOULD HAVE NO FURTHER CONSEQUENCES FOR HIMSELF AND PEOPLE ARE APT TO THINK THAT RESOLUTIONS TAKEN ON THEIR OWN BEHALF WILL BE FIRM AS FOR THE FIFTY FIVE FLORINS THE PURCHASE MONEY OF THE RING
THAT THAT VERY DELIGHT IN IMMUNITY WHICH PROMPTED RESOLUTIONS NOT TO ENTANGLE HIMSELF AGAIN WAS DEADENING THE SENSIBILITIES WHICH ALONE COULD SAVE HIM FROM ENTANGLEMENT
ONLY I'VE MADE YOU LOOK FRIGHTENED I MUST TAKE THE FRIGHT OUT OF IT FOR BACCHUS
BUT NOW DREW IT OFF AGAIN AND DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT MIND BEING GREY IF HER DEAR CHILD WOULD STAY WITH HER ROMOLA WAS TOO DEEPLY MOVED BY THE MAIN EVENTS WHICH SHE HAD KNOWN BEFORE COMING TO FLORENCE TO BE WROUGHT UPON BY THE DOUBTFUL GOSSIPING DETAILS ADDED IN BRIGIDA'S NARRATIVE
UNLESS INDEED HE HAD DESIGNED TO SINK IN LITERATURE IN PROPORTION AS HE ROSE IN HONOURS THAT BY A SORT OF COMPENSATION MEN OF LETTERS MIGHT FEEL THEMSELVES HIS EQUALS IN RETURN POLITIAN WAS BEGGED TO EXAMINE SCALA'S WRITINGS
PROPPED WITH THEIR FACES AGAINST THE WALL HE RETURNED WITH AN OIL SKETCH IN HIS HAND I CALL THIS AS GOOD A BIT OF PORTRAIT AS I EVER DID HE SAID LOOKING AT IT AS HE ADVANCED YOURS IS A FACE THAT EXPRESSES FEAR WELL BECAUSE IT'S NATURALLY A BRIGHT ONE I NOTICED IT THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU
THAN ON THAT GREEK EPIGRAM OF POLITIAN'S AFTER SUFFICIENT INTRODUCTORY TALK CONCERNING TITO'S TRAVELS AFTER A SURVEY AND DISCUSSION OF THE GEMS AND AN EASY PASSAGE FROM THE MENTION OF THE LAMENTED LORENZO'S EAGERNESS IN COLLECTING SUCH SPECIMENS OF ANCIENT ART
THE POOR THING HAS DONE NO CONSCIOUS WRONG SHE IS IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING I WILL TELL YOU BUT NOT NOW EARLY THE NEXT MORNING ROMOLA'S STEPS WERE DIRECTED TO THE HOUSE BEYOND SAN AMBROGIO WHERE SHE HAD ONCE FOUND TESSA
BUT AS SHE PUT ASIDE HER VEIL AND CROSSED THE STREET TOWARDS HIM SHE SAW SOMETHING HANGING FROM THE CORNER OF HIS BASKET WHICH MADE HER HEART LEAP WITH A MUCH STRONGER HOPE BRATTI MY FRIEND SHE SAID ABRUPTLY WHERE DID YOU GET THAT NECKLACE YOUR SERVANT MADONNA
THAT HE SHOWED HIMSELF QUITE WORTHY TO BE MADE A JUDGE IN THE NOTABLE CORRESPONDENCE CONCERNING THE CULEX HERE WAS THE GREEK EPIGRAM WHICH POLITIAN HAD DOUBTLESS THOUGHT THE FINEST IN THE WORLD THOUGH HE HAD PRETENDED TO BELIEVE THAT THE TRANSMARINI THE GREEKS THEMSELVES WOULD MAKE LIGHT OF IT
AND CONSEQUENTLY SENT THEM TO THEIR FRIENDS IN LETTERS WHICH WERE THE LITERARY PERIODICALS OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
TO THE SUBJECT OF CLASSICAL TASTES AND STUDIES IN GENERAL AND THEIR PRESENT CONDITION IN FLORENCE IT WAS INEVITABLE TO MENTION POLITIAN A MAN OF EMINENT ABILITY INDEED BUT A LITTLE TOO ARROGANT ASSUMING TO BE A HERCULES WHOSE OFFICE IT WAS TO DESTROY ALL THE LITERARY MONSTROSITIES OF THE AGE
AND TITO HAD AT THAT MOMENT A NAUSEATING WEARINESS OF SIMULATION HE WAS WELL OUT OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES THAT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN ON HIM FROM THAT INITIAL DECEPTION AND IT WAS NO LONGER A LOAD ON HIS MIND KIND FORTUNE HAD BROUGHT HIM IMMUNITY AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY FAIR THAT SHE SHOULD
AND ABOVE THERE MUST BE YOUNG LOVES SUCH AS YOU KNOW HOW TO PAINT SHOOTING WITH ROSES AT THE POINTS OF THEIR ARROWS SAY NO MORE
IT'S A SMALL PROFIT I'LL CHARGE YOU YOU SHALL HAVE IT FOR A FLORIN FOR I DON'T LIKE TO BE HARD HEARTED WHERE IS SHE SAID ROMOLA GIVING HIM THE MONEY AND UNCLASPING THE NECKLACE FROM THE BASKET IN JOYFUL AGITATION OUTSIDE THE GATE THERE AT THE OTHER END OF THE BORGO
FRIENDS LIKE FICINO AND LANDINO
ON ACCOUNT OF ITS ORIGIN FROM THE WATERS WAS IN MANY WAYS TICKLISH ON THE ONE HAND VENUS MIGHT BE OFFENDED
BUT WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE OF HIM STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE THE BASKET FROM THE CHILD RE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND PRESENTLY RETURNING WITH THE EMPTY BASKET SAID HOW MUCH TO PAY TWO GROSSONI MESSER PIERO THEY ARE ALL READY BOILED MY MOTHER SAYS
AND NOT ONLY HER INNATE RESERVE BUT A MORE NOBLE SENSITIVENESS MADE HER SHRINK FROM ASSUMING AN ATTITUDE OF GENEROSITY IN THE EYES OF OTHERS BY PUBLISHING TESSA'S RELATION TO TITO ALONG WITH HER OWN DESIRE TO FIND HER MANY DAYS PASSED IN ANXIOUS INACTION
BUT MONNA BRIGIDA THREW SUCH PLANNING INTO THE BACKGROUND BY CLAMOROUSLY INSISTING THAT ROMOLA MUST LIVE WITH HER AND NEVER FORSAKE HER TILL SHE HAD SEEN HER SAFE IN PARADISE ELSE WHY HAD SHE PERSUADED HER TO TURN PIAGNONE AND IF ROMOLA WANTED TO REAR OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN
I SAW YOU THIS MORNING AT NELLO'S IF YOU HAD ASKED ME THEN I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I SEE NO MAN IN THIS HOUSE WITHOUT KNOWING HIS BUSINESS AND AGREEING WITH HIM BEFOREHAND PARDON MESSER PIERO SAID TITO WITH HIS IMPERTURBABLE GOOD HUMOUR I ACTED WITHOUT SUFFICIENT REFLECTION
BUT AFTER ALL THE SALE OF THE RING WAS A SLIGHT MATTER WAS IT ALSO A SLIGHT MATTER THAT LITTLE TESSA WAS UNDER A DELUSION WHICH WOULD DOUBTLESS FILL HER SMALL HEAD WITH EXPECTATIONS DOOMED TO DISAPPOINTMENT SHOULD HE TRY TO SEE THE LITTLE THING ALONE AGAIN AND UNDECEIVE HER AT ONCE
AH THEN THAT WAS WHY YOU WENT AWAY AND LEFT ME WORD ONLY THAT YOU WENT OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL WELL WELL IF I'D KNOWN THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT YOU SO STRANGE AND FLIGHTY FOR I DID SAY TO MYSELF THOUGH I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY ELSE
AND THIS WAS NEITHER THE FIRST NOR THE SECOND TIME THAT SCALA HAD ASKED THE CANDID OPINION OF HIS FRIENDS AS TO THE BALANCE OF RIGHT AND WRONG IN SOME HALF SCORE LATIN LETTERS BETWEEN HIMSELF AND POLITIAN ALL SPRINGING OUT OF CERTAIN EPIGRAMS WRITTEN IN THE MOST PLAYFUL TONE IN THE WORLD
WHEN SHE ENCOUNTERED THAT MONK OF SAN SPIRITO WHO HAD BEEN HER GODFATHER'S CONFESSOR FROM HIM SHE LEARNED THE FULL STORY OF SAVONAROLA'S ARREST AND OF HER HUSBAND'S DEATH
IN A FEW MOMENTS TITO HEARD THE SOUND OF BOLTS THE DOOR OPENED AND PIERO PRESENTED HIMSELF IN A RED NIGHT CAP AND A LOOSE BROWN SERGE TUNIC WITH SLEEVES ROLLED UP TO THE SHOULDER HE DARTED A LOOK OF SURPRISE AT TITO
NEAREST OF ALL LIVING MEN TO THE PERFECTION OF THE ANCIENTS AND OF A TASTE SO FASTIDIOUS THAT STURGEON ITSELF MUST SEEM INSIPID TO HIM DEFENDED HIS OWN VERSES NEVERTHELESS THOUGH INDEED THEY WERE WRITTEN HASTILY WITHOUT CORRECTION
THE DOOR WAS A LITTLE BEHIND TESSA
AND WHEN SHALL I SIT FOR YOU SAID TITO FOR IF WE HAVE ONE LIKENESS WE MUST HAVE TWO
THAT NALDO COULD NEVER COME TO HER AGAIN NOT BECAUSE HE WAS CRUEL BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAD BUT BE COMFORTED MY TESSA SAID ROMOLA I AM COME TO TAKE CARE OF YOU ALWAYS AND WE HAVE GOT LILLO AND NINNA
IT APPEARED THERE WAS MUCH PROPERTY OF TITO'S TO WHICH SHE HAD A CLAIM BUT SHE DISTRUSTED THE CLEANNESS OF THAT MONEY AND SHE HAD DETERMINED TO MAKE IT ALL OVER TO THE STATE EXCEPT SO MUCH AS WAS EQUAL TO THE PRICE OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY THIS WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE MODEST SUPPORT OF TESSA AND THE CHILDREN
IT WAS THE STORY OF A VERY TYPICAL AND PRETTY QUARREL IN WHICH WE ARE INTERESTED BECAUSE IT SUPPLIED PRECISELY THAT THISTLE OF HATRED NECESSARY ACCORDING TO NELLO AS A STIMULUS TO THE SLUGGISH PACES OF THE CAUTIOUS STEED FRIENDSHIP POLITIAN
WHILE MARZOCCO THE REPUBLICAN LION WORE HIS GOLD CROWN ON THE OCCASION AND ALL THE PEOPLE CRIED VIVA MESSER BARTOLOMMEO HAD BEEN ON AN EMBASSY TO ROME AND HAD THERE BEEN MADE TITULAR SENATOR APOSTOLICAL SECRETARY KNIGHT OF THE GOLDEN SPUR
COULD NOT OBLIGE THEM AND AS TO THE HONOURS WHICH WERE OFFENSIVE TO THE ENVIOUS THEY HAD BEEN WELL EARNED WITNESS HIS WHOLE LIFE SINCE HE CAME IN PENURY TO FLORENCE THE ELEGANT SCHOLAR IN REPLY
HAD HE NOT BEEN UNINTENTIONALLY SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN HIS FALSE MODESTY TITO WAS READY AND SCARIFIED THE EPIGRAM TO SCALA'S CONTENT O WISE YOUNG JUDGE HE COULD DOUBTLESS APPRECIATE SATIRE EVEN IN THE VULGAR TONGUE AND SCALA
CORRECTED THE MISTAKE OF SCALA IN MAKING THE CULEX AN INSECT TOO WELL KNOWN ON THE BANKS OF THE ARNO OF THE INFERIOR OR FEMININE GENDER SCALA REPLIED BY A BAD JOKE IN SUITABLE LATIN VERSES REFERRING TO POLITIAN'S UNSUCCESSFUL SUIT BETTER AND BETTER
TUFTS OF LONG GRASS AND DARK FEATHERY FENNEL HAD MADE THEIR WAY AND A LARGE STONE VASE TILTED ON ONE SIDE SEEMED TO BE POURING OUT THE IVY THAT STREAMED AROUND ALL ABOUT THE WALLS HUNG PEN AND OIL SKETCHES OF FANTASTIC SEA MONSTERS DANCES OF SATYRS AND MAENADS
THE MAY AFTERNOON SUN WAS ON THE FLOWERS AND THE GRASS BEYOND THE PLEASANT SHADE OF THE LOGGIA THE TOO STATELY SILK LUCCO WAS CAST ASIDE AND THE LIGHT LOOSE MANTLE WAS THROWN OVER HIS TUNIC HIS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER ALESSANDRA AND HER HUSBAND THE GREEK SOLDIER POET MARULLO
WOULD ENCLOSE A GREEK EPIGRAM OF HIS OWN ON THE SAME INTERESTING INSECT NOT WE MAY PRESUME OUT OF ANY WISH TO HUMBLE SCALA BUT RATHER TO INSTRUCT HIM SAID EPIGRAM CONTAINING A LIVELY CONCEIT ABOUT VENUS CUPID AND THE CULEX OF A KIND MUCH TASTED AT THAT PERIOD
EVEN UNDER STRONG SOLICITATION FROM OTHER THOUGHTS ROMOLA FOUND HER HEART PALPITATING IF SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A PAIR OF ROUND BROWN LEGS OR OF A SHORT WOMAN IN THE CONTADINA DRESS SHE NEVER FOR A MOMENT TOLD HERSELF THAT IT WAS HEROISM OR EXALTED CHARITY IN HER TO SEEK THESE BEINGS
WERE SEATED ON ONE SIDE OF HIM ON THE OTHER TWO FRIENDS NOT OPPRESSIVELY ILLUSTRIOUS AND THEREFORE THE BETTER LISTENERS YET TO SAY NOTHING OF THE GOUT MESSER BARTOLOMMEO'S FELICITY WAS FAR FROM PERFECT IT WAS EMBITTERED BY THE CONTENTS OF CERTAIN PAPERS THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THE ARIADNE THERE SAID TITO GIVING HIM THE PASSAGE BUT YOU WILL REMEMBER I WANT THE CROWNED ARIADNE BY THE SIDE OF THE YOUNG BACCHUS SHE MUST HAVE GOLDEN HAIR
AND NOW MESSER GRECO SAID PIERO MAKING A SIGN TO TITO THAT HE MIGHT SIT DOWN ON A LOW STOOL NEAR THE DOOR AND THEN STANDING OVER HIM WITH FOLDED ARMS DON'T BE TRYING TO SEE EVERYTHING AT ONCE LIKE MESSER DOMENEDDIO BUT LET ME KNOW HOW LARGE YOU WOULD HAVE THIS SAME TRIPTYCH
OR SHOULD HE AT ONCE UNDECEIVE TESSA AND THEN TELL ROMOLA ABOUT HER SO THAT THEY MIGHT FIND SOME HAPPIER LOT FOR THE POOR THING NO THAT UNFORTUNATE LITTLE INCIDENT OF THE CERRETANO AND THE MARRIAGE AND HIS ALLOWING TESSA TO PART FROM HIM IN DELUSION MUST NEVER BE KNOWN TO ROMOLA
MONNA BRIGIDA'S MOUTH TWITCHED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN HER AWE OF ROMOLA AND THE DESIRE TO SPEAK UNSEASONABLY LET BE FOR THE PRESENT SHE THOUGHT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME A THOUSAND YEARS TILL I TELL THIS LITTLE CONTADINA
WHO FOUND HIS LATIN PROSE STYLE ELEGANT AND MASCULINE AND THE TERRIBLE JOSEPH SCALIGER WHO WAS TO PRONOUNCE HIM TOTALLY IGNORANT OF LATINITY WAS AT A COMFORTABLE DISTANCE IN THE NEXT CENTURY
ATTEMPTS AT POETIC FIGURES WHICH ARE MANIFEST SOLECISMS THAT MOMENT HAD COME TO POLITIAN THE SECRETARY HAD PUT FORTH HIS SOFT HEAD FROM THE OFFICIAL SHELL AND THE TERRIBLE LURKING CRAB WAS DOWN UPON HIM POLITIAN HAD USED THE FREEDOM OF A FRIEND
FOWLS CACKLE ASSES BRAY WOMEN CHATTER AND PHILOSOPHERS SPIN FALSE REASONS THAT'S THE EFFECT THE SIGHT OF THE WORLD BRINGS OUT OF THEM WELL I AM AN ANIMAL THAT PAINTS INSTEAD OF CACKLING OR BRAYING OR SPINNING LIES
WHO SEEMS NOT TO KNOW HOW MANY FINGERS SHE'S GOT ON HER HAND WHO ROMOLA IS AND I WILL TELL HER SOME DAY ELSE SHE'LL NEVER KNOW HER PLACE IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR ROMOLA NOBODY WILL CALL THEIR SOULS THEIR OWN WHEN SHE'S BY
FOUNDED PARTLY ON THE ZOOLOGICAL FACT THAT THE GNAT LIKE VENUS WAS BORN FROM THE WATERS SCALA IN REPLY BEGGED TO SAY THAT HIS VERSES WERE NEVER INTENDED FOR A SCHOLAR WITH SUCH DELICATE OLFACTORIES AS POLITIAN
HAS ANYTHING BEEN SEEN OR SAID SINCE TITO'S DEATH OF A YOUNG WOMAN WITH TWO LITTLE CHILDREN BRIGIDA STARTED ROUNDED HER EYES AND LIFTED UP HER HANDS CRISTO NO WHAT WAS HE SO BAD AS THAT MY POOR CHILD
THE SECRETARY WAS A VAIN AND POMPOUS MAN BUT HE WAS ALSO AN HONEST ONE HE WAS SINCERELY CONVINCED OF HIS OWN MERIT AND COULD SEE NO REASON FOR FEIGNING THE TOPMOST ROUND OF HIS AZURE LADDER HAD BEEN REACHED BY THIS TIME HE HAD HELD HIS SECRETARYSHIP THESE TWENTY YEARS
THAT COLD AND DAMP ORIGIN SEEMED DOUBTFUL TO SCALA IN THE CASE OF A CREATURE SO FOND OF WARMTH A FISH WERE PERHAPS THE BETTER COMPARISON OR WHEN THE POWER OF FLYING WAS IN QUESTION AN EAGLE
IF HE HAD HAD A TRUER FORESIGHT HE WOULD NOT HAVE PARTED WITH HIS RING FOR ROMOLA AND OTHERS TO WHOM IT WAS A FAMILIAR OBJECT WOULD BE A LITTLE STRUCK WITH THE APPARENT SORDIDNESS OF PARTING WITH A GEM HE HAD PROFESSEDLY CHERISHED UNLESS HE FEIGNED AS A REASON THE DESIRE TO MAKE SOME SPECIAL GIFT WITH THE PURCHASE MONEY
WHEN TITO LEFT THE VIA DE BARDI THAT DAY IN EXULTANT SATISFACTION AT FINDING HIMSELF THOROUGHLY FREE FROM THE THREATENED PERIL HIS THOUGHTS NO LONGER CLAIMED BY THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF ROMOLA AND HER FATHER
BARDO WAS FIERCE YOU CAN'T DENY IT BUT IF YOU HAD ONLY TOLD ME THE TRUTH THAT THERE WAS A YOUNG HUSSEY AND CHILDREN I SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL ANYTHING SEEN OR SAID OF HER NO AND THE LESS THE BETTER THEY SAY ENOUGH OF ILL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT THAT
THE TRAGEDY OF HER HUSBAND'S DEATH OF FRA GIROLAMO'S CONFESSION OF DUPLICITY UNDER THE COERCION OF TORTURE LEFT HER HARDLY ANY POWER OF APPREHENDING MINOR CIRCUMSTANCES
ON THE FOURTEENTH OF APRIL ROMOLA WAS ONCE MORE WITHIN THE WALLS OF FLORENCE UNABLE TO REST AT PISTOJA WHERE CONTRADICTORY REPORTS REACHED HER ABOUT THE TRIAL BY FIRE SHE HAD GONE ON TO PRATO AND WAS BEGINNING TO THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BE DRAWN ON TO FLORENCE IN SPITE OF DREAD
AT OLD SIBILLA MANETTI'S ANYBODY WILL TELL YOU WHICH IS THE HOUSE ROMOLA WENT ALONG WITH WINGED FEET BLESSING THAT INCIDENT OF THE CARNIVAL WHICH HAD MADE HER LEARN BY HEART THE APPEARANCE OF THIS NECKLACE SOON SHE WAS AT THE HOUSE SHE SOUGHT
THAT EVENING SHE WAS IN FLORENCE SITTING IN AGITATED SILENCE UNDER THE EXCLAMATIONS OF JOY AND WAILING MINGLED WITH EXUBERANT NARRATIVE WHICH WERE POURED INTO HER EARS BY MONNA BRIGIDA WHO HAD BACKSLIDED INTO FALSE HAIR IN ROMOLA'S ABSENCE
SAID BRATTI LOOKING ROUND AT HER VERY DELIBERATELY HIS MIND NOT BEING SUBJECT TO SURPRISE IT'S A NECKLACE WORTH MONEY BUT I SHALL GET LITTLE BY IT FOR MY HEART'S TOO TENDER FOR A TRADER'S I HAVE PROMISED TO KEEP IT IN PLEDGE PRAY TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT IT
BUT WHILE HE WAS BOASTING OF HIS FREEDOM FROM SERVILE IMITATION DID HE NOT FALL INTO THE OTHER EXTREME RUNNING AFTER STRANGE WORDS AND AFFECTED PHRASES EVEN IN HIS MUCH BELAUDED MISCELLANEA WAS EVERY POINT TENABLE
A REVEL INTERRUPTED BY A GHOST YOU SEEM TO LOVE THE BLENDING OF THE TERRIBLE WITH THE GAY I SUPPOSE THAT IS THE REASON YOUR SHELVES ARE SO WELL FURNISHED WITH DEATH'S HEADS WHILE YOU ARE PAINTING THOSE ROGUISH LOVES WHO ARE RUNNING AWAY WITH THE ARMOUR OF MARS
WAS NOT SURPRISED THAT SCALA FOUND THE AGE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM SINCE HE HIMSELF WAS SO DISTASTEFUL TO THE AGE NAY IT WAS WITH PERFECT ACCURACY THAT HE THE ELEGANT SCHOLAR HAD CALLED SCALA A BRANNY MONSTER
OF SAVONAROLA THE MONK TOLD HER IN THAT TONE OF UNFAVOURABLE PREJUDICE WHICH WAS USUAL IN THE BLACK BRETHREN FRATI NERI TOWARDS THE BROTHER WHO SHOWED WHITE UNDER HIS BLACK THAT HE HAD CONFESSED HIMSELF A DECEIVER OF THE PEOPLE ROMOLA PAUSED NO LONGER
NOWHERE WOULD HE FIND A MORE DEVOUT ADMIRATION OF ANTIQUITY THE SECRETARY WAS ASHAMED OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED AND BLUSHED FOR IT SOME INDEED THERE WERE WHO WANTED TO HAVE THEIR OWN WORKS PRAISED AND EXALTED TO A LEVEL WITH THE DIVINE MONUMENTS OF ANTIQUITY BUT HE SCALA
THAT WHEN HE HAD SCALA'S VERSES PLACED BEFORE HIM THERE WAS ANY QUESTION OF STURGEON BUT RATHER OF FROGS AND GUDGEONS MADE SHORT WORK WITH SCALA'S DEFENCE OF HIS OWN LATIN AND MANGLED HIM TERRIBLY ON THE SCORE OF THE STUPID CRITICISMS HE HAD VENTURED ON THE GREEK EPIGRAM KINDLY FORWARDED TO HIM AS A MODEL
THAT HE FELT A COLD STREAM THROUGH HIS VEINS AS IF HE WERE BEING THROWN INTO SYMPATHY WITH HIS IMAGED SELF
KEPT A VERY SHARP AND LEARNED TOOTH IN READINESS AGAINST THE TOO PROSPEROUS AND PRESUMPTUOUS SECRETARY WHO HAD DECLINED THE GREATEST SCHOLAR OF THE AGE FOR A SON IN LAW SCALA WAS A MERITORIOUS PUBLIC SERVANT AND MOREOVER A LUCKY MAN NATURALLY EXASPERATING TO AN OFFENDED SCHOLAR
NEAR A HEAP OF BROKEN EGG SHELLS AND A BANK OF ASHES IN STRANGE KEEPING WITH THAT SORDID LITTER THERE WAS A LOW BEDSTEAD OF CARVED EBONY COVERED CARELESSLY WITH A PIECE OF RICH ORIENTAL CARPET THAT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD SERVED TO COVER THE STEPS TO A MADONNA'S THRONE AND A CARVED CASSONE OR LARGE CHEST
HAD NO MONEY ONLY THEIR CLOTHES TO PAY A POOR WIDOW WITH FOR THEIR FOOD AND LODGING BUT SINCE MADONNA KNEW THEM ROMOLA WAITED TO HEAR NO MORE BUT OPENED THE DOOR TESSA WAS SEATED ON THE LOW BED
HE HAD BARELY ENOUGH GREEK TO MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF THE EPIGRAM SO GRACIOUSLY SENT HIM TO SAY NOTHING OF TASTING ITS ELEGANCES BUT THE EPIGRAM WAS POLITIAN'S WHAT MORE NEED BE SAID STILL
POLITIAN HAD BEEN GENEROUSLY WILLING TO HOLD UP A MIRROR BY WHICH THE TOO INFLATED SECRETARY BEHOLDING HIS OWN LIKENESS MIGHT BE INDUCED TO CEASE SETTING UP HIS IGNORANT DEFENCES OF BAD LATIN AGAINST ANCIENT AUTHORITIES WHOM THE CONSENT OF CENTURIES HAD PLACED BEYOND QUESTION
WHEN A LITTLE GIRL ENTERED THE COURT WITH A BASKET OF EGGS ON HER ARM WENT UP TO THE DOOR AND STANDING ON TIPTOE PUSHED UP A SMALL IRON PLATE THAT RAN IN GROOVES AND PUTTING HER MOUTH TO THE APERTURE THUS DISCLOSED CALLED OUT IN A PIPING VOICE MESSER PIERO
WALKING ALONG THE VIA SAN GALLO AND LOOKING WATCHFULLY ABOUT HER THROUGH HER LONG WIDOW'S VEIL LEST SHE SHOULD MISS ANY OBJECT THAT MIGHT AID HER SHE DESCRIED BRATTI CHAFFERING WITH A CUSTOMER THAT ROAMING MAN SHE THOUGHT MIGHT AID HER SHE WOULD NOT MIND TALKING OF TESSA TO HIM
WHY TITO WAS SAFE TITO HAD GOOD REASONS FOR SAYING THAT HE WAS SAFE
MAKE THE FINEST POSSIBLE ORATION AT NAPLES TO WELCOME THE FRENCH KING WHO HAD COME TO DETHRONE THE LEARNED ORATOR'S ROYAL FRIEND AND PATRON AND STILL PONTANUS HELD UP HIS HEAD AND PROSPERED MEN DID NOT REALLY CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS EXCEPT WHEN THEIR PERSONAL SPLEEN WAS TOUCHED
AFTER THE UTTERANCE OF THAT BLESSING SAVONAROLA HIMSELF FELL ON HIS KNEES AND HID HIS FACE IN TEMPORARY EXHAUSTION THOSE GREAT JETS OF EMOTION WERE A NECESSARY PART OF HIS LIFE HE HIMSELF HAD SAID TO THE PEOPLE LONG AGO WITHOUT PREACHING I CANNOT LIVE
HE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN IF HE COULD TO BE EVEN MORE THAN USUALLY KIND BUT HE COULD NOT ON A SUDDEN MASTER AN INVOLUNTARY SHRINKING FROM HER WHICH BY A SUBTLE RELATION DEPENDED ON THOSE VERY CHARACTERISTICS IN HIM THAT MADE HIM
COULD HANG OVER THE BOOKS AND LIVE WITH SHADOWS ALL HIS LIFE HOWEVER HE HAD PUT HIS HEART INTO THAT BERNARDO GAVE A SLIGHT SHRUG AS HE SPOKE THE LAST WORDS BUT ROMOLA DISCERNED IN HIS VOICE A FEELING THAT ACCORDED WITH HER OWN
WITHOUT HUMAN INSTRUMENTS WHOM IT WOULD NOT BE UNBECOMING TO KICK OR TO SPIT UPON IN THE ACT OF HANDING THEM THEIR WAGES
HIS PREACHING WAS A MUSIC TO WHICH THE PEOPLE FELT THEMSELVES MARCHING ALONG THE WAY THEY WISHED TO GO
WERE THE MORE INCLINED TO CREDIT TITO WITH SINCERITY IN HIS POLITICAL ADHESION TO THEM BECAUSE HE AFFECTED NO RELIGIOUS SYMPATHIES BY VIRTUE OF THESE CONDITIONS THE LAST THREE MONTHS HAD BEEN A TIME OF FLATTERING SUCCESS TO TITO
ROMOLA THOUGHT SHE DISCERNED AN EFFORT IN HIS LIVELINESS AND ATTRIBUTING IT TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN HIM THAT SHE HAD BEEN WOUNDED IN THE MORNING ACCEPTED THE EFFORT AS AN ACT OF PENITENCE INWARDLY ACHING A LITTLE AT THAT SIGN OF GROWING DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM
THE ATTITUDE HAD BEEN A FREQUENT ONE AND TITO WAS ACCUSTOMED WHEN HE FELT HER HAND THERE TO RAISE HIS HEAD THROW HIMSELF A LITTLE BACKWARD AND LOOK UP AT HER
HEREDITARY INTERESTS ALLIANCES AND PREJUDICES
SOME OF THESE VERY MEN WHO PASSED A TACIT JUDGMENT ON TITO WERE SHORTLY TO BE ENGAGED IN A MEMORABLE TRANSACTION THAT COULD BY NO MEANS HAVE BEEN CARRIED THROUGH WITHOUT THE USE OF AN UNSCRUPULOUSNESS AS DECIDED AS HIS BUT AS THEIR OWN BRIGHT POET PULCI HAD SAID FOR THEM
AND WITH THAT APPARENTLY UNAFFECTED ADMISSION OF BEING ACTUATED BY MOTIVES SHORT OF THE HIGHEST WHICH IS OFTEN THE INTENSEST AFFECTATION THERE WERE SEVERAL WHOSE MINDS WERE NOT TOO ENTIRELY PREOCCUPIED TO PASS A NEW JUDGMENT ON HIM IN THESE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES
AND WITHIN THIS BARRIER WERE ALREADY ASSEMBLING THE DOMINICAN BRETHREN OF SAN MARCO BUT THE TEMPORARY WOODEN PULPIT ERECTED OVER THE CHURCH DOOR WAS STILL EMPTY
ROMOLA DISCERNED A WISH IN THIS INTIMATION AND IMMEDIATELY ASSENTED BUT PRESENTLY COMING BACK IN HER HOOD AND MANTLE SHE SAID OH WHAT A LONG BREATH FLORENCE WILL TAKE WHEN THE GATES ARE FLUNG OPEN AND THE LAST FRENCHMAN IS WALKING OUT OF THEM
VALORI'S MIND WAS NOT INTENSELY BENT ON THE ESTIMATION OF TITO'S CONDUCT AND IT WAS INTENSELY BENT ON PROCURING AN EXTREME SENTENCE AGAINST THE FIVE PRISONERS THERE WERE SURE TO BE IMMENSE EFFORTS TO SAVE THEM
IF I HAVE NOT WROUGHT IN SINCERITY OF SOUL IF MY WORD COMETH NOT FROM THEE STRIKE ME IN THIS MOMENT WITH THY THUNDER AND LET THE FIRES OF THY WRATH ENCLOSE ME
WHICH IN THEIR EXQUISITE DELICACY SEEMED TRANSFIGURED FROM AN ANIMAL ORGAN FOR GRASPING INTO VEHICLES OF SENSIBILITY TOO ACUTE TO NEED ANY GROSS CONTACT HANDS THAT CAME LIKE AN APPEALING SPEECH FROM THAT PART OF HIS SOUL WHICH WAS MASKED BY HIS STRONG PASSIONATE FACE
HE HAD THAT DEGREE OF SELF CONTEMPLATION WHICH NECESSARILY ACCOMPANIES THE HABIT OF ACTING ON WELL CONSIDERED REASONS OF WHATEVER QUALITY AND IF HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN HE WOULD HAVE DECLINED TO SEE HIMSELF DISAPPROVED BY MEN OF THE WORLD HE HAD NEVER MEANT TO BE DISAPPROVED
FLORENTINES WHOSE PASSIONS WERE ENGAGED IN THEIR PETTY AND PRECARIOUS POLITICAL SCHEMES MIGHT HAVE NO SELF INTEREST SEPARABLE FROM FAMILY PRIDE AND TENACITY IN OLD HATREDS AND ATTACHMENTS A MODERN SIMPLETON WHO SWALLOWED WHOLE ONE OF THE OLD SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY
THE WORK HE HAD BEFORE HIM WAS TOO GREAT FOR THE DIVINE POWER TO LEAVE IT HALTING HIS FAITH WAVERED BUT NOT HIS SPEECH IT IS THE LOT OF EVERY MAN WHO HAS TO SPEAK FOR THE SATISFACTION OF THE CROWD THAT HE MUST OFTEN SPEAK IN VIRTUE OF YESTERDAY'S FAITH
AND PERHAPS TO A LITTLE HISSING WHEN ENMITY WANTED A PRETEXT IT WAS A FAINT PROGNOSTIC OF THAT HISSING GATHERED BY TITO FROM CERTAIN INDICATIONS WHEN HE WAS BEFORE THE COUNCIL WHICH GAVE HIS PRESENT CONDUCT THE CHARACTER OF AN EPOCH TO HIM AND MADE HIM DWELL ON IT WITH ARGUMENTATIVE VINDICATION
FRA GIROLAMO MUST BE COMING NOW THAT EXPECTATION RATHER THAN ANY SPELL FROM THE ACCUSTOMED WAIL OF PSALMODY WAS WHAT MADE SILENCE AND EXPECTATION SEEM TO SPREAD LIKE A PALING SOLEMN LIGHT OVER THE MULTITUDE OF UPTURNED FACES
AND WON THEM OVER TO HIS OPINION LATE IN THE DAY TITO WAS ADMITTED TO AN AUDIENCE OF THE SPECIAL COUNCIL
IT IS BETTER THAN HAVING NO PORTRAIT SAID ROMOLA APOLOGETICALLY AFTER BERNARDO HAD BEEN SILENT A LITTLE WHILE IT IS LESS LIKE HIM NOW THAN THE IMAGE I HAVE IN MY MIND BUT THEN THAT MIGHT FADE WITH THE YEARS SHE RESTED HER ARM ON THE OLD MAN'S SHOULDER AS SHE SPOKE
IT SEEMED A WEARY TIME TO THE EAGER PEOPLE WHILE THE BLACK FIGURE KNELT AND THE MONKS CHANTED
HE HAD SERVED THEM VERY ABLY AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT IF THEIR PARTY HAD BEEN WINNERS HE WOULD HAVE MERITED HIGH REWARD BUT WAS HE TO RELINQUISH ALL THE AGREEABLE FRUITS OF LIFE BECAUSE THEIR PARTY HAD FAILED HIS PROFFER OF A LITTLE ADDITIONAL PROOF AGAINST THEM WOULD PROBABLY HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON THEIR FATE
THAT WANTED TO STIFLE IT IT RANG LIKE A TRUMPET TO THE EXTREMITIES OF THE PIAZZA AND UNDER IT EVERY HEAD WAS BOWED
UNSCRUPULOUSNESS GETS RID OF MUCH BUT NOT OF TOOTHACHE OR WOUNDED VANITY OR THE SENSE OF LONELINESS AGAINST WHICH AS THE WORLD AT PRESENT STANDS THERE IS NO SECURITY BUT A THOROUGHLY HEALTHY JAW AND A JUST LOVING SOUL
THE ARREST OF LAMBERTO DELL ANTELLA WITH A TELL TALE LETTER ON HIS PERSON AND A BITTER RANCOUR AGAINST THE MEDICI IN HIS HEART WAS AN INCALCULABLE EVENT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE IN SPITE OF THE CAREFUL PRETEXTS WITH WHICH HIS AGENCY HAD BEEN GUARDED THAT TITO SHOULD ESCAPE IMPLICATION
FAREWELL MY SWEET ONE I MUST WAIT AT HOME TAKE MASO WITH YOU STILL TITO DID NOT LOOK UP AND ROMOLA WENT OUT WITHOUT SAYING ANY MORE
MADE IT EVIDENT THAT IN THE PREVIOUS SILENCE AND UNIVERSAL KNEELING HOSTILITY AND SCORN HAD ONLY SUBMITTED UNWILLINGLY TO A MOMENTARY SPELL
BEFORE AN AUDIENCE THAT WOULD REPRESENT ALL CHRISTENDOM IN WHOSE PRESENCE HE SHOULD AGAIN BE SEALED AS THE MESSENGER OF THE SUPREME RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FEEL HIMSELF FULL CHARGED WITH DIVINE STRENGTH IT WAS BUT A MOMENT THAT EXPANDED ITSELF IN THAT PREVISION
THAN HE LAID DOWN HIS PEN AND LOOKED UP IN DELIGHTFUL SECURITY FROM SEEING ANYTHING ELSE THAN PARCHMENT AND BROKEN MARBLE HE WAS RATHER DISGUSTED WITH HIMSELF THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO LOOK UP AT ROMOLA AND BEHAVE TO HER JUST AS USUAL
HOPING IT WILL COME BACK TO MORROW IT WAS IN PREPARATION FOR A SCENE WHICH WAS REALLY A RESPONSE TO THE POPULAR IMPATIENCE FOR SOME SUPERNATURAL GUARANTEE OF THE PROPHET'S MISSION THAT THE WOODEN PULPIT HAD BEEN ERECTED ABOVE THE CHURCH DOOR
SO FRANCESCO VALORI ZEALOUSLY BELIEVED AND PERHAPS HE WAS NOT HIMSELF AWARE THAT THE STRENGTH OF HIS ZEAL WAS DETERMINED BY HIS HATRED
AND AT NO MOMENT COULD IT LOOK LIKE A TEMPTATION TO HIM BUT ONLY LIKE A HIDEOUS ALTERNATIVE
OTHERS JARRED WITH SCORN AND HATRED OF THE AMBITIOUS DECEIVER WHO WAS GETTING UP THIS NEW COMEDY BEFORE WHICH NEVERTHELESS THEY FELT THEMSELVES IMPOTENT AS BEFORE THE TRIUMPH OF A FASHION BUT THEN CAME THE VOICE
IT WAS PRESENTLY TO BE ENTERED BY THE MAN WHOM THE POPE'S COMMAND HAD BANISHED FROM THE PULPIT OF THE DUOMO WHOM THE OTHER ECCLESIASTICS OF FLORENCE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO CONSORT WITH WHOM THE CITIZENS HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO HEAR ON PAIN OF EXCOMMUNICATION
AN AGENCY INDUCED BY MOTIVES ABOUT WHICH HE WAS VERY FRANK DECLARING AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THEIR EFFORTS FUTILE AND THAT HE SINCERELY PREFERRED THE MAINTENANCE OF THE POPULAR GOVERNMENT AFFECTED TO CONFIDE TO VALORI AS A SECRET HIS OWN PERSONAL DISLIKE FOR BERNARDO DEL NERO
FROM THE PRESSURE OF NEW COMERS TRYING TO FORCE THEIR WAY FORWARD FROM ALL THE OPENINGS BUT THE FRONT RANKS WERE ALREADY CLOSE SERRIED AND RESISTED THE PRESSURE THOSE RANKS WERE RANGED AROUND A SEMICIRCULAR BARRIER IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH
ESPECIALLY AGAINST BERNARDO DEL NERO WHO SO FAR AS APPEARED HITHERTO HAD SIMPLY REFRAINED FROM BETRAYING THE LATE PLOT AFTER HAVING TRIED IN VAIN TO DISCOURAGE IT FOR THE WELFARE OF FLORENCE DEMANDED THAT THE GUILT OF BERNARDO DEL NERO SHOULD BE PUT IN THE STRONGEST LIGHT
HE WOULD ATTEST HIS CHOICE BY SOME UNMISTAKABLE SIGN AS LONG AS THE BELIEF IN THE PROPHET CARRIED NO THREAT OF OUTWARD CALAMITY BUT RATHER THE CONFIDENT HOPE OF EXCEPTIONAL SAFETY NO SIGN WAS NEEDED
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN SCOLDING YOUR HUSBAND FOR KEEPING AWAY FROM HOME SO MUCH LATELY I SEE HIM EVERYWHERE BUT HERE SAID BERNARDO WILLING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT SHE FELT THE FLUSH SPREAD OVER HER NECK AND FACE AS SHE SAID
THAT THERE WAS AN OFFENCE ABOUT WHICH NEITHER OF THEM DARED TO SPEAK THE NEXT DAY TITO REMAINED AWAY FROM HOME UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT
CAUSING SOME AWE STRICKEN SPECTATORS TO START TIMIDLY BUT SOON THERE WAS A WIDER PARTING AND WITH A GENTLE QUICKNESS LIKE A SMILE A STREAM OF BRIGHTNESS POURED ITSELF ON THE CRYSTAL VASE AND THEN SPREAD ITSELF OVER SAVONAROLA'S FACE WITH MILD GLORIFICATION
HE HAD HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH RESOURCES HE HAD BEEN STRENGTHENING HIS INFLUENCE AT ROME AND AT MILAN BY BEING THE MEDIUM OF SECRET INFORMATION AND INDIRECT MEASURES AGAINST THE FRATE AND THE POPULAR PARTY
IF WE COULD ONLY SEE HIS LONGEST DEAREST WISH FULFILLED JUST TO HIS MIND WELL SO WE MAY SAID BERNARDO KINDLY RISING AND PUTTING ON HIS CAP THE TIMES ARE CLOUDY NOW BUT FISH ARE CAUGHT BY WAITING WHO KNOWS
I'M AFRAID THERE'LL BE SMALL AGREEMENT AMONG US WHEN HE'S GONE BUT AT ANY RATE ALL PARTIES ARE AGREED IN BEING GLAD NOT TO HAVE FLORENCE STIFLED WITH SOLDIERY ANY LONGER
WHICH DEPRIVED HIMSELF AND ROMOLA OF SUBSTANTIAL ADVANTAGES MIGHT PERHAPS NEVER HAVE WROUGHT ITSELF INTO ACTION BUT FOR THE EVENTS OF THE PAST WEEK WHICH HAD BROUGHT AT ONCE THE PRESSURE OF A NEW MOTIVE AND THE OUTLET OF A RARE OPPORTUNITY
HE WISHED AMONG OTHER THINGS TO CARRY ROMOLA WITH HIM AND NOT IF POSSIBLE TO CARRY ANY INFAMY
AND THAT PROBLEM OF ARRANGING LIFE TO HIS MIND HAD BEEN THE SOURCE OF ALL HIS MISDOING HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUAL TO ANY SACRIFICE THAT WAS NOT UNPLEASANT THE RUSTLING MAGNATES CAME AND WENT THE BARGAINS HAD BEEN CONCLUDED AND ROMOLA RETURNED HOME
IT WAS WEAKNESS ONLY THAT WAS DESPISED POWER OF ANY SORT CARRIED ITS IMMUNITY AND NO MAN UNLESS BY VERY RARE GOOD FORTUNE COULD MOUNT HIGH IN THE WORLD WITHOUT INCURRING A FEW UNPLEASANT NECESSITIES WHICH LAID HIM OPEN TO ENMITY
THERE WAS ONE THING THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE PANG OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER HUSBAND HARDER TO BEAR IT WAS THAT ANY ONE SHOULD KNOW HE GAVE HER CAUSE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT THIS MIGHT BE A WOMAN'S WEAKNESS BUT IT IS CLOSELY ALLIED TO A WOMAN'S NOBLENESS
SHE WAS THE WIFE OF HIS FIRST LOVE HE LOVED HER STILL SHE BELONGED TO THAT FURNITURE OF LIFE WHICH HE SHRANK FROM PARTING WITH HE WINCED UNDER HER JUDGMENT HE FELT UNCERTAIN HOW FAR THE REVULSION OF HER FEELING TOWARDS HIM MIGHT GO
AND KEPT HIM FROM RAISING HIS HEAD TO MEET HER EYES THEIR PURE LIGHT BROUGHT TOO NEAR HIM THE PROSPECT OF A COMING STRUGGLE BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE HELPED IF THEY HAD TO LEAVE FLORENCE THEY MUST HAVE MONEY
HE WAS TO RETAIN HIS SECRETARYSHIP FOR ANOTHER YEAR UNLESS HE PREVIOUSLY RESIGNED IT AND LASTLY THE PRICE BY WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED THESE GUARANTEES WAS TO BE KEPT AS A STATE SECRET
WRITTEN ON NOW WITH DEEPER LINES ABOUT THE MOUTH AND BROW THAN ARE MADE BY FORTY FOUR YEARS OF ORDINARY LIFE AT THE FIRST STRETCHING OUT OF THE HANDS SOME OF THE CROWD IN THE FRONT RANKS FELL ON THEIR KNEES AND HERE AND THERE A DEVOUT DISCIPLE FARTHER OFF
CLEAR AND LOW AT FIRST UTTERING THE WORDS OF ABSOLUTION
VERY SLIGHT THINGS MAKE EPOCHS IN MARRIED LIFE AND THIS MORNING FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE ADMITTED TO HERSELF NOT ONLY THAT TITO HAD CHANGED BUT THAT HE HAD CHANGED TOWARDS HER DID THE REASON LIE IN HERSELF
AND ALL THAT SENSE OF POWER OVER A WIFE WHICH MAKES A HUSBAND RISK BETRAYALS THAT A LOVER NEVER VENTURES ON WOULD NOT SUFFICE TO COUNTERACT TITO'S UNEASINESS THIS WAS THE LEADEN WEIGHT WHICH HAD BEEN TOO STRONG FOR HIS WILL
DRAWN TOWARDS HIM STRONGLY BY THEIR COMMON INTEREST IN THE DEAD I DON'T KNOW SAID BERNARDO I ALMOST THINK I SEE BARDO AS HE WAS WHEN HE WAS YOUNG BETTER THAN THAT PICTURE SHOWS HIM TO ME AS HE WAS WHEN HE WAS OLD YOUR FATHER HAD A GREAT DEAL OF FIRE IN HIS EYES WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
BUT WAS SPREADING ITSELF IMPARTIALLY OVER ALL THINGS CLEAN AND UNCLEAN THERE BEGAN ALONG WITH THE GENERAL MOVEMENT OF THE CROWD A CONFUSION OF VOICES IN WHICH CERTAIN STRONG DISCORDS AND VARYING SCALES OF LAUGHTER
FRUIT IS SEED MY ROMOLA SAID TITO THE SECOND MORNING AFTER HE HAD MADE HIS SPEECH IN THE PIAZZA DEL DUOMO I AM TO RECEIVE GRAND VISITORS TO DAY
BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY STOOD FIRM SOME RESISTING THE IMPULSE TO KNEEL BEFORE THIS EXCOMMUNICATED MAN MIGHT NOT A GREAT JUDGMENT FALL UPON HIM EVEN IN THIS ACT OF BLESSING
MANY OF THEM HAVING FATHERS BROTHERS OR COUSINS AMONG THE ARTISANS AND SHOPKEEPERS WHO MADE THE MAJORITY OF THE CROWD IT WAS NOT TILL THE TALE OF MONKS WAS COMPLETE NOT TILL THEY HAD FLUTTERED THEIR BOOKS AND HAD BEGUN TO CHANT THAT PEOPLE SAID TO EACH OTHER
ALL NOW DIRECTED TOWARDS THE EMPTY PULPIT THE NEXT INSTANT THE PULPIT WAS NO LONGER EMPTY A FIGURE COVERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN BLACK COWL AND MANTLE HAD ENTERED IT AND WAS KNEELING WITH BENT HEAD AND WITH FACE TURNED AWAY
THEY SILENTLY CONCLUDED THAT THIS INGENIOUS AND SERVICEABLE GREEK WAS IN FUTURE RATHER TO BE USED FOR PUBLIC NEEDS THAN FOR PRIVATE INTIMACY UNPRINCIPLED MEN WERE USEFUL
BUT HIS QUICK MIND HAD SOON TRACED OUT THE COURSE THAT WOULD SECURE HIS OWN SAFETY WITH THE FEWEST UNPLEASANT CONCOMITANTS IT IS AGREEABLE TO KEEP A WHOLE SKIN BUT THE SKIN STILL REMAINS AN ORGAN SENSITIVE TO THE ATMOSPHERE
PROVOKING A RESPONSE OUTWARDLY IN THE DECLARATION THAT AT THE FITTING TIME THE MIRACLE WOULD COME INWARDLY IN THE FAITH NOT UNWAVERING FOR WHAT FAITH IS SO THAT IF THE NEED FOR MIRACLE BECAME URGENT
BUT WHILE THE ORDINARY FRATI IN BLACK MANTLES WERE ENTERING AND ARRANGING THEMSELVES
BUT IT WAS A LIFE THAT SHATTERED HIM IN A FEW MINUTES MORE SOME HAD RISEN TO THEIR FEET BUT A LARGER NUMBER REMAINED KNEELING AND ALL FACES WERE INTENTLY WATCHING HIM
EVEN WITH A BAG OF DIAMONDS AND INCUR THE LIFE OF AN ADVENTURER IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF INDEPENDENT EVEN OF THOSE FLORENTINES WHO ONLY GREETED HIM WITH REGARD STILL LESS WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF INDEPENDENT OF ROMOLA
HE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH WANTED YOU KNOW HE SPEAKS SO WELL I AM GLAD TO KNOW THAT HIS VALUE IS UNDERSTOOD YOU ARE CONTENTED THEN MADONNA ORGOGLIOSA SAID BERNARDO SMILING AS HE MOVED TO THE DOOR ASSUREDLY POOR ROMOLA
THOUGH THE POPE WAS HANGING TERRIBLE THREATS OVER FLORENCE IF IT DID NOT RENOUNCE THE PESTILENTIAL SCHISMATIC AND SEND HIM TO ROME TO BE CONVERTED STILL AS ON THIS VERY MORNING ACCEPTED THE COMMUNION FROM HIS EXCOMMUNICATED HANDS
THIS MAN HAD SAID A WICKED UNBELIEVING POPE WHO HAS GAINED THE PONTIFICAL CHAIR BY BRIBERY IS NOT CHRIST'S VICAR HIS CURSES ARE BROKEN SWORDS HE GRASPS A HILT WITHOUT A BLADE
WITH EYES UPLIFTED AND A QUIVERING EXCITEMENT IN HIS WHOLE ASPECT EVERY ONE ELSE WAS MOTIONLESS AND SILENT TOO WHILE THE SUNLIGHT WHICH FOR THE LAST QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD HERE AND THERE BEEN PIERCING THE GREYNESS MADE FITFUL STREAKS ACROSS THE CONVENT WALL
IT IS ONE THING TO LOVE THE FRUITS OF TREACHERY
BUT ONE OF THE SPECIAL COUNCIL APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EVIDENCE OF THE PLOT FRANCESCO VALORI AS WE HAVE SEEN WAS THE HEAD OF THE PIAGNONI A MAN WITH CERTAIN FINE QUALITIES THAT WERE NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH VIOLENT PARTISANSHIP
HIS RECKONING HAD NOT DECEIVED HIM THAT NIGHT BEFORE HE RETURNED HOME HE HAD SECURED THE THREE RESULTS FOR WHICH HE MOST CARED
I HAVE JUST LOOKED IN TO TELL YOU THE GOOD NEWS FOR I KNOW TITO HAS NOT COME YET SAID BERNARDO THE FRENCH KING MOVES OFF TO MORROW NOT BEFORE IT IS HIGH TIME
AND THE REWARDS OF TALENT AND LEARNING WERE MORE SPLENDID AT PRESENT THE SCALE DIPPED IN FAVOUR OF MILAN AND IF WITHIN THE YEAR HE COULD RENDER CERTAIN SERVICES TO DUKE LUDOVICO SFORZA
BUT NO MAN OF CLEAR INTELLECT ALLOWED HIS COURSE TO BE DETERMINED BY SUCH PUERILE IMPULSES OR QUESTIONABLE INWARD FUMES DID NOT PONTANUS POET AND PHILOSOPHER OF UNRIVALLED LATINITY
BEHOLD THE ANSWER THE WARM RADIANCE THRILLED THROUGH SAVONAROLA'S FRAME AND SO DID THE SHOUT IT WAS HIS LAST MOMENT OF UNTROUBLED TRIUMPH AND IN ITS RAPTUROUS CONFIDENCE HE FELT CARRIED TO A GRANDER SCENE YET TO COME
HIS NATURE WAS ONE OF THOSE MOST REMOTE FROM DEFIANCE OR IMPUDENCE AND ALL HIS INCLINATIONS LEANED TOWARDS PRESERVING ROMOLA'S TENDERNESS HE WAS NOT TORMENTED BY SENTIMENTAL SCRUPLES
AND IT WAS TO BE WISHED ON PUBLIC GROUNDS THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM SHOULD BE OF THE STRONGEST SO AS TO ALARM ALL WELL AFFECTED MEN AT THE DANGERS OF CLEMENCY
IT WAS A MOMENTOUS QUESTION
AS WHEN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOR SOMETHING IN THE HEAVENS SEE THE EXPECTED PRESENCE SILENTLY DISCLOSING ITSELF
FOR SEEING AT THIS DISTANCE MY OLD EYES ARE PERHAPS BETTER THAN YOUR YOUNG ONES OLD MEN'S EYES ARE LIKE OLD MEN'S MEMORIES THEY ARE STRONGEST FOR THINGS A LONG WAY OFF
URGED TO A DESPERATE LEAP BY THE TERROR OF THE TOOTH AND THE CLAW THAT ARE CLOSE BEHIND IT THE SECRET FEELING HE HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD THAT THE TENACIOUS ADHERENCE TO BARDO'S WISHES ABOUT THE LIBRARY HAD BECOME UNDER EXISTING DIFFICULTIES A PIECE OF SENTIMENTAL FOLLY
WITH AN ARROGANT TEMPER THAT ALIENATED HIS FRIENDS NOR WITH BITTER PERSONAL ANIMOSITIES ONE OF THE BITTEREST BEING DIRECTED AGAINST BERNARDO DEL NERO TO HIM IN A BRIEF PRIVATE INTERVIEW AFTER OBTAINING A PLEDGE OF SECRECY
AND HE WAS DISAPPOINTED TO THE LAST SHE SAID INVOLUNTARILY BUT IMMEDIATELY FEARING LEST HER WORDS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO IMPLY AN ACCUSATION AGAINST TITO SHE WENT ON ALMOST HURRIEDLY
IT SEEMS TO ME THE PLAUDITS ARE GIVING WAY TO CRITICISM SAID TITO WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THE SCENE ATTENTIVELY FROM AN UPPER LOGGIA IN ONE OF THE HOUSES OPPOSITE THE CHURCH
WELL A LITTLE PATIENCE AND IN ANOTHER YEAR OR PERHAPS IN HALF A YEAR HE MIGHT TURN HIS BACK ON THESE HARD EAGER FLORENTINES WITH THEIR FUTILE QUARRELS AND SINKING FORTUNES HIS BRILLIANT SUCCESS AT FLORENCE HAD HAD SOME UGLY FLAWS IN IT HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE WRONG WOMAN
IN FACT HE FELT CONVINCED THEY WOULD ESCAPE ANY EXTREME CONSEQUENCES BUT IF HE HAD NOT GIVEN IT HIS OWN FORTUNES WHICH MADE A PROMISING FABRIC WOULD HAVE BEEN UTTERLY RUINED AND WHAT MOTIVE COULD ANY MAN REALLY HAVE EXCEPT HIS OWN INTEREST
THE GREAT FAVOURITE OF THE CRISTIANISSIMO I KNOW YOU DON'T CARE TO GO THROUGH SMILING CEREMONIES WITH THESE RUSTLING MAGNATES WHOM WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO SEE AGAIN AND AS THEY WILL WANT TO LOOK AT THE ANTIQUITIES AND THE LIBRARY PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER GIVE UP YOUR WORK TO DAY AND GO TO SEE YOUR COUSIN BRIGIDA
WHEN I SHOULD HOLD THIS SACRAMENT IN MY HAND IN THE FACE OF YOU ALL TO PRAY FERVENTLY TO THE MOST HIGH THAT IF THIS WORK OF MINE DOES NOT COME FROM HIM HE WILL SEND A FIRE AND CONSUME ME
DON'T YOU WANT YOUR SPECTACLES GODFATHER SAID ROMOLA IN ANXIETY THAT HE SHOULD SEE JUST WHAT SHE SAW NO CHILD NO SAID BERNARDO UNCOVERING HIS GREY HEAD AS HE SEATED HIMSELF WITH FIRM ERECTNESS
NAMELY WHAT WAS AND WHAT WAS NOT ACCORDANT WITH THE HIGHEST SPIRITUAL LAW
ENABLING THOSE WHO HAD MORE SCRUPLES TO KEEP THEIR HANDS TOLERABLY CLEAN IN A WORLD WHERE THERE WAS MUCH DIRTY WORK TO BE DONE
WHICH WAS TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED INTO EXECUTION IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS VERY MONTH OF AUGUST DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE ON THIS SUBJECT WOULD DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO MAKE THE RIGHT COURSE CLEAR HE RECEIVED A COMMISSION TO START FOR SIENA BY BREAK OF DAY AND BESIDES THIS
BY A JOURNEY TO SIENA AND INTO ROMAGNA WHERE PIERO DE MEDICI WAS AGAIN TRYING TO GATHER FORCES OBTAIN DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE TO LAY BEFORE THE COUNCIL
AND TITO WAS FEELING INTENSELY AT THIS MOMENT THAT NO DEVICES COULD SAVE HIM FROM PAIN IN THE IMPENDING COLLISION WITH ROMOLA NO PERSUASIVE BLANDNESS COULD CUSHION HIM AGAINST THE SHOCK TOWARDS WHICH HE WAS BEING DRIVEN LIKE A TIMID ANIMAL
HE HAD MEANT ALWAYS TO CONDUCT HIMSELF SO ABLY THAT IF HE ACTED IN OPPOSITION TO THE STANDARD OF OTHER MEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE AWARE OF IT AND THE BARRIER BETWEEN HIMSELF AND ROMOLA HAD BEEN RAISED BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH CONCEALMENT WITH HER
AND AN INTERDICT ON THEIR CITY THERE INEVITABLY CAME THE QUESTION WHAT MIRACLE SHOWEST THOU SLOWLY AT FIRST THEN FASTER AND FASTER THAT FATAL DEMAND HAD BEEN SWELLING IN SAVONAROLA'S EAR
THE FRENCH ARE AS READY TO GO FROM FLORENCE AS THE WASPS TO LEAVE A RIPE PEAR WHEN THEY HAVE JUST FASTENED ON IT ROMOLA KEENLY SENSITIVE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE USUAL RESPONSE TOOK AWAY HER HAND AND SAID I AM GOING TITO
THE SAME SOCIETY HAS HAD A GIBBET FOR THE MURDERER AND A GIBBET FOR THE MARTYR AN EXECRATING HISS FOR A DASTARDLY ACT AND AS LOUD A HISS FOR MANY A WORD OF GENEROUS TRUTHFULNESS OR JUST INSIGHT A MIXED CONDITION OF THINGS WHICH IS THE SIGN NOT OF HOPELESS CONFUSION
SO THAT THOSE WHO HAD ALREADY THE WILL TO STONE HIM FELT THEIR ARMS UNNERVED AT LAST THERE WAS A VIBRATION AMONG THE MULTITUDE EACH SEEMING TO GIVE HIS NEIGHBOUR A MOMENTARY ASPEN LIKE TOUCH
AND HENCE THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN A SOURCE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUTHORITIES MUST BE WRAPPED IN PROFOUND SECRECY STILL SOME ODOUR OF THE FACTS MIGHT ESCAPE IN SPITE OF PRECAUTION AND BEFORE TITO COULD INCUR THE UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES OF ACTING AGAINST HIS FRIENDS
AND TO THOSE WHO STOOD NEAR THE PULPIT IT WAS AS IF THE SOUNDS WHICH HAD JUST BEEN FILLING THEIR EARS HAD SUDDENLY MERGED THEMSELVES IN THE FORCE OF SAVONAROLA'S FLASHING GLANCE AS HE LOOKED ROUND HIM IN THE SILENCE THEN HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS
WHO WERE THE BITTEREST ENEMIES OF SAVONAROLA CARRIED ON A SYSTEM OF UNDERHAND CORRESPONDENCE AND ESPIONAGE IN WHICH THE DEEPEST HYPOCRISY WAS THE BEST SERVICE AND DEMANDED THE HEAVIEST PAY
HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF WELL TRIED SKILL COULD HE NOT STRIP HIMSELF OF THE PAST AS OF REHEARSAL CLOTHING AND THROW AWAY THE OLD BUNDLE TO ROBE HIMSELF FOR THE REAL SCENE IT DID NOT ENTER INTO TITO'S MEDITATIONS ON THE FUTURE THAT ON ISSUING FROM THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND DESCENDING THE STAIRS
HE LOOKED ROUND AS HE SPOKE THEN TURNING TO HER AND PATTING HER CHEEK SAID AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY DYING MY GHOST WILL CLAIM NOTHING I'VE TAKEN CARE OF THAT IN MY WILL ROMOLA SEIZED THE HAND THAT WAS AGAINST HER CHEEK AND PUT IT TO HER LIPS IN SILENCE
OR THE VOICE OF AN INWARD MONITOR MIGHT SEE HIS INTEREST IN A FORM OF SELF CONCEIT WHICH HE CALLED SELF REWARDING VIRTUE FANATICS WHO BELIEVED IN THE COMING SCOURGE AND RENOVATION MIGHT SEE THEIR OWN INTEREST IN A FUTURE PALM BRANCH AND WHITE ROBE
HE HAD CULTIVATED MORE ASSIDUOUSLY THAN EVER THE REGARD OF THIS PARTY BY SHOWING SUBTLE EVIDENCE THAT HIS POLITICAL CONVICTIONS WERE ENTIRELY ON THEIR SIDE AND ALL THE WHILE
NAY IT WAS NOT TILL HIS DREAD HAD BEEN AGGRAVATED BY THE SIGHT OF BALDASSARRE LOOKING MORE LIKE HIS SANE SELF NOT UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL THAT HE MIGHT BE COMPELLED TO FLEE FROM FLORENCE
IT WAS FELT THAT SAVONAROLA WOULD NOT APPEAR JUST YET AND THERE WAS SOME INTEREST IN SINGLING OUT THE VARIOUS MONKS SOME OF THEM BELONGING TO HIGH FLORENTINE FAMILIES
WHICH AS HE HAD DEMONSTRATED TO HIMSELF BY A VERY RAPID COURSE OF ARGUMENT HAD NO RELATION TO SOLID UTILITY BUT HIS FREEDOM FROM SCRUPLES DID NOT RELEASE HIM FROM THE DREAD OF WHAT WAS DISAGREEABLE
IF SOME IN A SPIRIT OF DEVOUT OBEDIENCE MADE THE EFFORT TO PRAY EVERY CONSCIOUSNESS WAS CHIEFLY POSSESSED BY THE SENSE THAT SAVONAROLA WAS PRAYING IN A VOICE NOT LOUD BUT DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE WIDE STILLNESS LORD
AND EVERY ONE KNEW THERE WAS A SECOND BONFIRE OF VANITIES BEING PREPARED IN FRONT OF THE OLD PALACE BUT AT THIS HOUR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE CENTRE OF POPULAR INTEREST LAY ELSEWHERE
HE SHRANK FROM CONDEMNATORY JUDGMENTS AS FROM A CLIMATE TO WHICH HE COULD NOT ADAPT HIMSELF BUT THINGS WERE NOT SO PLASTIC IN THE HANDS OF CLEVERNESS AS COULD BE WISHED AND EVENTS HAD TURNED OUT INCONVENIENTLY HE HAD REALLY NO RANCOUR AGAINST MESSER BERNARDO DEL NERO
AND IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO SEE THE NEXT UNLESS A TRAITOR TURNED UP LAMBERTO DELL ANTELLA HAD BEEN TORTURED IN AID OF HIS PREVIOUS WILLINGNESS TO TELL MORE THAN HE KNEW NEVERTHELESS ADDITIONAL AND STRONGER FACTS WERE DESIRABLE
THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BECAME ONE OF THE POWERFUL WAR CENTERS OF THE NATION IN A MEMORABLE ADDRESS TO THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR PRESIDENT WILSON ASSURED THE TRADE UNIONISTS THAT LABOR CONDITIONS SHOULD NOT BE MADE UNDULY ONEROUS BY THE WAR
THE CONFLICT IN EUROPE RAISED FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS RESPECTING RIGHTS OF AMERICANS TRADING WITH COUNTRIES AT PEACE AS WELL AS THOSE AT WAR ON THIS POINT THERE EXISTED ON AUGUST FIRST NINETEEN FOURTEEN A FAIRLY DEFINITE BODY OF PRINCIPLES BY WHICH NATIONS WERE BOUND
THE SHIP WAS STRUCK BY TWO TORPEDOES AND IN A FEW MINUTES WENT DOWN BY THE BOW
THESE WERE THE IDEALS FOR WHICH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE TO POUR OUT THEIR BLOOD AND TREASURE THE SELECTIVE DRAFT THE WORLD WAR BECAME A WAR OF NATIONS THE POWERS AGAINST WHICH WE WERE ARRAYED
ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO DEPEND UPON THE ACTION OF THE PROGRESSIVES IF THE BREACH CREATED IN NINETEEN TWELVE COULD BE CLOSED VICTORY WAS POSSIBLE IF NOT DEFEAT WAS CERTAIN
THE FIRST MEASURE PENALIZED THOSE WHO CONVEYED INFORMATION TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO BE USED TO THE INJURY OF THE UNITED STATES THOSE WHO MADE FALSE STATEMENTS DESIGNED TO INTERFERE WITH THE MILITARY OR NAVAL FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES
EXCEEDS THE MANIFEST NECESSITY OF A BELLIGERENT AND CONSTITUTES RESTRICTIONS UPON THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS ON THE HIGH SEAS WHICH ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW OR REQUIRED UNDER THE PRINCIPLE OF SELF PRESERVATION
MUST BE A TEAM IN WHICH EACH MAN SHALL PLAY THE PART FOR WHICH HE IS BEST FITTED LIBERTY LOANS AND TAXES IN ORDER THAT THE MILITARY AND NAVAL FORCES SHOULD BE STINTED IN NO RESPECT THE NATION WAS CALLED UPON TO PLACE ITS FINANCIAL RESOURCES AT THE SERVICE OF THE GOVERNMENT
ON THE SIXTH OF NOVEMBER REPORTED GENERAL PERSHING
A NEW QUESTION AROSE IN CONNECTION WITH AMERICAN TRADE WITH THE NEUTRAL COUNTRIES SURROUNDING GERMANY GREAT BRITAIN EARLY BEGAN TO INTERCEPT SHIPS CARRYING OIL GASOLINE AND COPPER ALL WAR MATERIALS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE
AND WOULD AWAIT AN OVERT ACT BEFORE TAKING FURTHER STEPS TO PRESERVE AMERICAN RIGHTS GOD GRANT HE CONCLUDED THAT WE MAY NOT BE CHALLENGED TO DEFEND THEM BY ACTS OF WILLFUL INJUSTICE ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT OF GERMANY YET THE CHALLENGE CAME
PRESIDENT WILSON SOON AFTER THE ELECTION ADDRESSED PEACE NOTES TO THE EUROPEAN BELLIGERENTS ON DECEMBER SIXTEENTH THE GERMAN EMPEROR PROPOSED TO THE ALLIED POWERS THAT THEY ENTER INTO PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
DEATH BENEFITS WERE INSTITUTED AND A SYSTEM OF NATIONAL INSURANCE WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE INTEREST OF THE MEN IN SERVICE NEVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY HAD THE GOVERNMENT TAKEN SUCH A WISE AND HUMANE VIEW OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TO THOSE WHO SERVED ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE OR ON THE SEAS
PRESIDENT WILSON MADE IT CLEAR TO GERMANY THAT HE MEANT WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE WROTE THAT HE WOULD MAINTAIN THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS FINALLY AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION AND SHIFTING ABOUT THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR ON SEPTEMBER FIRST NINETEEN FIFTEEN
ACTING ON THE PRESIDENT'S ADVICE DECLARED WAR ALSO ON THAT VASSAL OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT AMERICAN WAR AIMS IN MANY ADDRESSES AT THE BEGINNING AND DURING THE COURSE OF THE WAR PRESIDENT WILSON STATED THE PURPOSES WHICH ACTUATED OUR GOVERNMENT IN TAKING UP ARMS
TO USE THE LANGUAGE OF THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES WE WERE PERFECTLY AWARE THAT A POSSIBLE WARLIKE ATTITUDE OF AUSTRIA HUNGARY AGAINST SERBIA MIGHT BRING RUSSIA UPON THE FIELD AND THAT IT MIGHT THEREFORE INVOLVE US IN A WAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR DUTIES AS ALLIES
ABUSIVE LANGUAGE ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT OR INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY IT AUTHORIZED THE DISMISSAL OF ANY OFFICER OF THE GOVERNMENT WHO COMMITTED DISLOYAL ACTS OR UTTERED DISLOYAL LANGUAGE AND EMPOWERED THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO CLOSE THE MAILS
THREE DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE NEWS THAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT INTENDED TO RETURN TO ITS FORMER SUBMARINE POLICY PRESIDENT WILSON SEVERED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE GERMAN EMPIRE AT THE SAME TIME HE EXPLAINED TO CONGRESS THAT HE DESIRED NO CONFLICT WITH GERMANY
EARLY IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN SHE DECLARED EVEN CARGOES OF GRAIN AND FLOUR TO BE CONTRABAND DEFENDING THE ACTION ON THE GROUND THAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT HAD RECENTLY TAKEN POSSESSION OF ALL DOMESTIC STOCKS OF CORN WHEAT AND FLOUR
THE BATTLESHIPS OF THE UNITED STATES WERE ALWAYS READY TO DO THEIR FULL DUTY IN SUCH AN EVENT AS THINGS TURNED OUT THE SERVICE OF THE AMERICAN NAVY WAS LIMITED MAINLY TO HELPING IN THE CAMPAIGN THAT WORE DOWN THE SUBMARINE MENACE TO ALLIED SHIPPING THE WAR IN FRANCE
IS THE HIGH WATER MARK IN THE HISTORY OF TAXATION NEVER BEFORE IN THE ANNALS OF CIVILIZATION HAS AN ATTEMPT BEEN MADE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS TWO THIRDS OF A MAN'S INCOME BY TAXATION MOBILIZING MATERIAL RESOURCES
WAS FOUNDED TO SECURE FAIR PLAY FOR GERMANY AND AUSTRIA SEVERAL PROFESSORS IN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES WHO HAD RECEIVED THEIR TRAINING IN GERMANY TOOK UP THE PEN IN DEFENSE OF THE CENTRAL EMPIRES THE GERMAN LANGUAGE PRESS WITHOUT EXCEPTION IT SEEMS
TO PERSONS VIOLATING THE LAW THIS MEASURE PREPARED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ENCOUNTERED VIGOROUS OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE WHERE TWENTY FOUR REPUBLICANS AND TWO DEMOCRATS VOTED AGAINST IT SENATOR JOHNSON OF CALIFORNIA DENOUNCED IT AS A LAW
RECALLING THEIR LONG AND BITTER STRUGGLE FOR HOME RULE IN IRELAND WOULD HAVE REGARDED BRITISH DEFEAT AS A MERITED REDRESS OF ANCIENT GRIEVANCES EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO AMERICAN OPINION BUT ILL INFORMED ABOUT IT
IN SEPTEMBER AMERICAN TROOPS WITH FRENCH AID WIPED OUT THE GERMAN SALIENT AT SAINT MIHIEL BY THIS TIME GENERAL PERSHING WAS READY FOR THE GREAT AMERICAN DRIVE TO THE NORTHEAST IN THE ARGONNE FOREST
RAW MATERIALS RAILWAYS MINES SHIPS FORESTS AND INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES NO POWER OVER THE LIVES AND PROPERTY OF CITIZENS DEEMED NECESSARY TO THE PROSECUTION OF THE ARMED CONFLICT WAS WITHHELD FROM THE GOVERNMENT
IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THE EXPRESS TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH BUSINESS OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY PASSED UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL BY WAR RISK INSURANCE ACTS ALLOWANCES WERE MADE FOR THE FAMILIES OF ENLISTED MEN COMPENSATION FOR INJURIES WAS PROVIDED
MUST PUT A CURB UPON OUR SENTIMENTS AS WELL AS UPON EVERY TRANSACTION THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS A PREFERENCE OF ONE PARTY TO THE STRUGGLE BEFORE ANOTHER THE CLASH OVER AMERICAN TRADE AS IN THE TIME OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS
OF MAINTAINING THE RIGHTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND ITS CITIZENS AND OF SAFEGUARDING THEIR FREE EXERCISE AND ENJOYMENT THE DIE WAS CAST BUT GERMANY IN REPLY MERELY TEMPORIZED IN A SECOND NOTE MADE PUBLIC ON JUNE ELEVENTH
TO THREE MILLION SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND OF WHOM MORE THAN TWO MILLION WERE IN FRANCE WHEN THE ARMISTICE WAS SIGNED ALTHOUGH AMERICAN TROOPS DID NOT TAKE PART ON A LARGE SCALE UNTIL THE LAST PHASE OF THE WAR IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
IN THE ELECTION WHICH ENSUED PRESIDENT WILSON'S POPULAR VOTE EXCEEDED THAT CAST FOR MISTER HUGHES BY MORE THAN HALF A MILLION WHILE HIS ELECTORAL VOTE STOOD TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR
AND SUCH A PEACE CAN BE ESTABLISHED ONLY IF IT IS BASED UPON SOCIAL JUSTICE THE FAILURE OF ANY NATION TO ADOPT HUMANE CONDITIONS OF LABOR IS AN OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF OTHER NATIONS WHICH DESIRE TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES
THE GERMAN DECREE ADDED THAT AS THE BRITISH ADMIRALTY HAD ORDERED THE USE OF NEUTRAL FLAGS BY ENGLISH SHIPS IN TIME OF DISTRESS NEUTRAL VESSELS WOULD BE IN DANGER OF DESTRUCTION IF FOUND IN THE FORBIDDEN AREA
AND WHAT IS CONTRABAND OF WAR THE TASK OF ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS FELL TO GREAT BRITAIN AS MISTRESS OF THE SEAS ALTHOUGH THE GERMAN SUBMARINES MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER BATTLESHIPS TO MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS PATROL OF THE WATERS IN FRONT OF BLOCKADED PORTS
PRESIDENT WILSON IN AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE SENATE DECLARED IT TO BE A DUTY OF THE UNITED STATES TO TAKE PART IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STABLE PEACE ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRINCIPLES THESE WERE IN SHORT PEACE WITHOUT VICTORY
THE RESULT WAS REGARDED AND NOT WITHOUT WARRANT AS A GREAT PERSONAL TRIUMPH FOR THE PRESIDENT HE HAD RECEIVED THE LARGEST VOTE YET CAST FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY PRACTICALLY DISAPPEARED
SEVERAL BATTALIONS OF INFANTRY WERE IN THE TRENCHES BY OCTOBER NINETEEN SEVENTEEN AND HAD THEIR FIRST SEVERE ENCOUNTER WITH THE GERMANS EARLY IN NOVEMBER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THEY TOOK OVER A PART OF THE FRONT LINE AS AN AMERICAN SECTOR
OWING TO THE PECULIAR CHARACTER OF THE WARFARE IN FRANCE IT REQUIRED A LONGER TIME FOR AMERICAN MILITARY FORCES TO GET INTO ACTION BUT THERE WAS NO UNNECESSARY DELAY SOON AFTER THE DECLARATION OF WAR STEPS WERE TAKEN TO GIVE MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE ALLIES
A PROGRESSIVE TAX WAS LAID UPON INCOMES BEGINNING WITH FOUR PER CENT ON INCOMES IN THE LOWER RANGES AND RISING TO SIXTY THREE PER CENT OF THAT PART OF ANY INCOME ABOVE TWO MILLION DOLLARS A PROGRESSIVE TAX WAS LEVIED UPON INHERITANCES
ON FEBRUARY TENTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN IT WARNED GERMANY THAT IF HER COMMANDERS DESTROYED AMERICAN LIVES AND SHIPS IN OBEDIENCE TO THAT DECREE THE ACTION WOULD BE VERY HARD INDEED TO RECONCILE WITH THE FRIENDLY RELATIONS HAPPILY SUBSISTING BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS
THE READJUSTMENT OF THE TURKISH EMPIRE AN INDEPENDENT POLAND AND AN ASSOCIATION OF NATIONS TO AFFORD MUTUAL GUARANTEES TO ALL STATES GREAT AND SMALL
WERE PUT IN MORTAL PERIL THIS AMAZING CONDUCT GERMANY JUSTIFIED ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS MERE RETALIATION AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN FOR HER VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THE RESPONSE OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE OMINOUS GERMAN ORDER WAS SWIFT AND DIRECT
IT WAS CLEAR THAT GERMANY INTENDED TO EMPLOY SUBMARINES TO DESTROY SHIPPING A NEW FACTOR WAS THUS INTRODUCED INTO NAVAL WARFARE ONE NOT PROVIDED FOR IN THE ACCEPTED LAWS OF WAR
AGAINST THESE EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES THE STATE DEPARTMENT AT WASHINGTON LODGED POINTED OBJECTIONS SAYING THIS GOVERNMENT IS RELUCTANTLY FORCED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PRESENT POLICY OF HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT TOWARD NEUTRAL SHIPS AND CARGOES
TO SUPPRESS THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS IN THE UNITED STATES AND TO PREVENT ANY MAN NO MATTER WHO HE IS
THE STORM NOW BROKE IN ALL ITS PITILESS FURY THE STATE OF AMERICAN OPINION ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT WILSON PROMPTLY PROCLAIMED THE NEUTRALITY OF THE UNITED STATES
WHEN IT WAS DUMBFOUNDED TO HEAR ON JANUARY THIRTY FIRST THAT THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR AT WASHINGTON HAD ANNOUNCED THE OFFICIAL RENEWAL OF RUTHLESS SUBMARINE WARFARE THE UNITED STATES AT WAR STEPS TOWARD WAR
NO STONE WAS LEFT UNTURNED TO PROVIDE THE ARMS MUNITIONS SUPPLIES AND TRANSPORTATION REQUIRED IN THE GIGANTIC UNDERTAKING BETWEEN THE DECLARATION OF WAR AND THE ARMISTICE CONGRESS ENACTED LAW AFTER LAW RELATIVE TO FOOD SUPPLIES
IT IS A TRIUMPH NOT ONLY OF DIPLOMACY BUT OF REASON OF HUMANITY OF JUSTICE AND OF TRUTH THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAW IN IT A RECOGNITION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES FOR WHICH WE HAVE CONTENDED
ON JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH A GERMAN RAIDER SANK THE AMERICAN SHIP WILLIAM P FRYE IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC ON MARCH TWENTY EIGHTH A BRITISH SHIP THE FALABA WAS SUNK BY A SUBMARINE AND MANY ON BOARD INCLUDING AN AMERICAN CITIZEN
IN THE SECOND PLACE IT WAS AGREED THAT CONTRABAND OF WAR FOUND ON AN ENEMY OR NEUTRAL SHIP WAS A LAWFUL PRIZE ANY SHIP SUSPECTED OF CARRYING IT WAS LIABLE TO SEARCH AND IF CAUGHT WITH FORBIDDEN GOODS WAS SUBJECT TO SEIZURE IN THE THIRD PLACE
AN AFFAIR WHICH SHOULD BE SETTLED SOLELY BETWEEN AUSTRIA HUNGARY AND SERBIA MEANING THAT THE SMALL NATION SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE TENDER MERCIES OF A GREAT POWER RUSSIA REFUSED TO TAKE THIS VIEW GREAT BRITAIN PROPOSED A SETTLEMENT BY MEDIATION GERMANY BACKED UP AUSTRIA TO THE LIMIT
THE AMERICAN NOTE ADDED THAT THE GERMAN IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE HELD TO STRICT ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALL NECESSARY STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD AMERICAN LIVES AND AMERICAN RIGHTS THIS WAS FIRM AND CLEAR LANGUAGE BUT THE ONLY RESPONSE WHICH IT EVOKED FROM GERMANY
TO THESE NOTES THE CENTRAL POWERS REPLIED THAT THEY WERE READY TO MEET THEIR ANTAGONISTS IN A PEACE CONFERENCE AND ALLIED POWERS ANSWERED BY PRESENTING CERTAIN CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO A SATISFACTORY SETTLEMENT ON JANUARY TWENTY SECOND NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
CAN POSSIBLY BE ACCEPTED AS AN EXCUSE OR PALLIATION FOR THAT ACT OR AS AN ABATEMENT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS COMMISSION IT CALLED UPON THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT TO DISAVOW THE ACT MAKE REPARATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT
TO THE SPOKESMEN FOR ALL THE CONTENDING POWERS OF EUROPE BEFORE TWO WEEKS HAD ELAPSED THE CONTROVERSY HAD BECOME SO INTENSE THAT PRESIDENT WILSON AUGUST EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN WAS MOVED TO CAUTION HIS COUNTRYMEN AGAINST FALLING INTO ANGRY DISPUTES
WARNING TRAVELERS OF THE DANGERS IN THE WAR ZONE AND NOTIFYING THEM THAT ANY WHO VENTURED ON BRITISH SHIPS INTO THAT AREA DID SO AT THEIR OWN RISK ON THAT DAY THE LUSITANIA A BRITISH STEAMER
THE AMERICAN NAVY IN THE WAR AS SOON AS CONGRESS DECLARED WAR THE FLEET WAS MOBILIZED AMERICAN PORTS WERE THROWN OPEN TO THE WARSHIPS OF THE ALLIES
INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN AMERICAN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN A CRY OF HORROR RAN THROUGH THE COUNTRY
GERMANY BEGINS THE SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN GERMANY NOW ANNOUNCED THAT ON AND AFTER FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN THE WHOLE OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AND THE WATERS AROUND GREAT BRITAIN WOULD BE DEEMED A WAR ZONE
THE RIGHT OF NATIONALITIES TO FREEDOM AND SELF GOVERNMENT THE INDEPENDENCE OF POLAND FREEDOM OF THE SEAS THE REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS AND THE ABOLITION OF ENTANGLING ALLIANCES THE WHOLE WORLD WAS DISCUSSING THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKABLE MESSAGE
FROM THE MEN OF THE FIRST GROUP SO ENROLLED WERE CHOSEN BY LOT THE SOLDIERS FOR THE WORLD WAR WHO WITH THE REGULAR ARMY AND THE NATIONAL GUARD FORMED THE AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE UPHOLDING THE AMERICAN CAUSE ON THE BATTLEFIELDS OF EUROPE THE WHOLE NATION SAID THE PRESIDENT
HE FIRST MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT WAS A WAR OF SELF DEFENSE THE MILITARY MASTERS OF GERMANY HE EXCLAIMED DENIED US THE RIGHT TO BE NEUTRAL PROOF OF THAT LAY ON EVERY HAND AGENTS OF THE GERMAN IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT HAD DESTROYED AMERICAN LIVES AND AMERICAN PROPERTY ON THE HIGH SEAS
SOME URGED THE CONSCRIPTION OF WEALTH AS WELL AS MEN MEANING THE SUPPORT OF THE WAR OUT OF TAXES UPON GREAT FORTUNES BUT MORE CONSERVATIVE COUNSELS PREVAILED FOUR GREAT LIBERTY LOANS WERE FLOATED
WAS A SUGGESTION THAT IF GREAT BRITAIN WOULD ALLOW FOOD SUPPLIES TO PASS THROUGH THE BLOCKADE THE SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN WOULD BE DROPPED VIOLATIONS OF AMERICAN RIGHTS MEANWHILE GERMANY CONTINUED TO RAVAGE SHIPPING ON THE HIGH SEAS
FIVE DAYS LATER THE END CAME ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER ELEVENTH THE ORDER TO CEASE FIRING WENT INTO EFFECT THE GERMAN ARMY WAS IN RAPID RETREAT AND DEMORALIZATION HAD BEGUN THE KAISER HAD ABDICATED AND FLED INTO HOLLAND
IN A VERY REMARKABLE MESSAGE READ TO CONGRESS ON JANUARY EIGHTH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN PRESIDENT WILSON LAID DOWN HIS FAMOUS FOURTEEN POINTS SUMMARIZING THE IDEALS FOR WHICH WE WERE FIGHTING THEY INCLUDED OPEN TREATIES OF PEACE OPENLY ARRIVED AT
THE RECURRENCE OF ANYTHING SO OBVIOUSLY SUBVERSIVE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF WARFARE THE NOTE CLOSED WITH A CLEAR CAUTION TO GERMANY THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD NOT OMIT ANY WORD OR ANY ACT NECESSARY TO THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS SACRED DUTY
THIS SENTIMENT MISTER HUGHES ECHOED IN HIS ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BY SOME IT WAS INTERPRETED TO MEAN A FIRMER POLICY IN DEALING WITH GREAT BRITAIN BY OTHERS A MORE VIGOROUS HANDLING OF THE SUBMARINE MENACE THE DEMOCRATS ON THEIR SIDE
SHIPS BOUND FOR DENMARK NORWAY AND SWEDEN WERE ORDERED TO COME BY THE ENGLISH CHANNEL FOR INSPECTION AND SAILING DIRECTIONS IN EFFECT AMERICANS WERE NOW LICENSED BY GREAT BRITAIN TO TRADE IN CERTAIN COMMODITIES AND IN CERTAIN AMOUNTS WITH NEUTRAL COUNTRIES
AMONG THEM THE FOLLOWING WERE OF VITAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT AN ENEMY MERCHANT SHIP CAUGHT ON THE HIGH SEAS WAS A LEGITIMATE PRIZE OF WAR WHICH MIGHT BE SEIZED AND CONFISCATED
THE REPLY OF CONGRESS ON APRIL SIXTH WAS A RESOLUTION PASSED WITH ONLY A FEW DISSENTING VOTES DECLARING THE EXISTENCE OF A STATE OF WAR WITH GERMANY AUSTRIA HUNGARY AT ONCE SEVERED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL DECEMBER SEVENTH THAT CONGRESS
THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SOON BEGAN SYSTEMATIC EFFORTS TO PRESENT ITS CAUSE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE MOST FAVORABLE LIGHT POSSIBLE DOCTOR BERNHARD DERNBURG THE FORMER COLONIAL SECRETARY OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE WAS SENT TO AMERICA AS A SPECIAL AGENT
IN THE FACE OF THE CLAMOR FOR EXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY WITH ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE CONTENDING POWERS OF EUROPE THE REPUBLICANS CHOSE A MIDDLE COURSE DECLARING THAT THEY WOULD UPHOLD ALL AMERICAN RIGHTS AT HOME AND ABROAD BY LAND AND BY SEA
AND THE SOCIALISTS SUFFERED A SEVERE SET BACK FALLING FAR BEHIND THE VOTE OF NINETEEN TWELVE PRESIDENT WILSON URGES PEACE UPON THE WARRING NATIONS APPARENTLY CONVINCED THAT HIS PACIFIC POLICIES HAD BEEN PROFOUNDLY APPROVED BY HIS COUNTRYMEN
THE REGULAR ARMY WAS ENLARGED AND THE TROOPS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD WERE BROUGHT INTO NATIONAL SERVICE ON JUNE THIRTEENTH GENERAL JOHN J PERSHING CHOSEN HEAD OF THE AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCES REACHED PARIS AND BEGAN PREPARATIONS FOR THE ARRIVAL OF OUR TROOPS
SHE DECLARED THE BLOCKADE TO BE NONE THE LESS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE HER NAVY WAS SUPREME AS TO CONTRABAND OF WAR GREAT BRITAIN PUT SUCH A BROAD INTERPRETATION UPON THE TERM AS TO INCLUDE NEARLY EVERY IMPORTANT ARTICLE OF COMMERCE
THE GOVERNMENT ASSUMED FOR THE PERIOD OF THE WAR THE OPERATION OF THE RAILWAYS UNDER A PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION WHICH WAS ELABORATED IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN BY ACT OF CONGRESS
IF IT COULD TO BLOCKADE THE PORTS OF AN ENEMY AND PREVENT THE INGRESS AND EGRESS OF ALL SHIPS BUT SUCH A BLOCKADE TO BE LAWFUL HAD TO BE EFFECTIVE THESE GENERAL PRINCIPLES LEFT UNDETERMINED TWO IMPORTANT MATTERS WHAT IS AN EFFECTIVE BLOCKADE
WERE KILLED AND ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH A GERMAN AIRPLANE DROPPED BOMBS ON THE AMERICAN STEAMER CUSHING ON THE MORNING OF MAY FIRST NINETEEN FIFTEEN AMERICANS WERE ASTOUNDED TO SEE IN THE NEWSPAPERS AN ADVERTISEMENT SIGNED BY THE GERMAN IMPERIAL EMBASSY
WHILE HE ALSO COOEPERATED WITH THE BRITISH IN THE ASSAULT ON THE HINDENBURG LINE IN THE MEUSE ARGONNE BATTLE OUR SOLDIERS ENCOUNTERED SOME OF THE MOST SEVERE FIGHTING OF THE WAR AND PRESSED FORWARD STEADILY AGAINST THE MOST STUBBORN RESISTANCE FROM THE ENEMY
CONGRESS BY LAW DECREED THAT THE NATIONAL ARMY SHOULD BE CHOSEN FROM ALL MALE CITIZENS AND MALES NOT ENEMY ALIENS WHO HAD DECLARED THEIR INTENTION OF BECOMING CITIZENS
IN THEIR LIFE AND DEATH CONTEST WITH SUBMARINES SPECIAL EFFORT WAS MADE TO STIMULATE THE PRODUCTION OF SUBMARINE CHASERS AND SCOUT CRUISERS TO BE SENT TO THE DANGER ZONE CONVOYS WERE PROVIDED TO ACCOMPANY THE TRANSPORTS CONVEYING SOLDIERS TO FRANCE
THE FARMER'S WHEAT THE HOUSEWIFE'S SUGAR COAL AT THE MINES LABOR IN THE FACTORIES SHIPS AT THE WHARVES TRADE WITH FRIENDLY COUNTRIES THE RAILWAYS BANKS STORES PRIVATE FORTUNES ALL WERE MOBILIZED AND LAID UNDER WHATEVER OBLIGATIONS THE GOVERNMENT DEEMED IMPERATIVE
A WARSHIP OVERHAULING A MERCHANT VESSEL COULD EASILY TAKE ITS CREW AND PASSENGERS ON BOARD FOR SAFE KEEPING AS PRESCRIBED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT A SUBMARINE ORDINARILY COULD DO NOTHING OF THE SORT OF NECESSITY THE LIVES AND THE SHIPS OF NEUTRALS AS WELL AS OF BELLIGERENTS
THEY REGARDED THE GERMAN IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT AS AN AUTOCRATIC POWER WIELDED IN THE INTEREST OF AN AMBITIOUS MILITARY PARTY
THE RESTORATION OF BELGIUM RIGHTING THE WRONG DONE TO FRANCE IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE IN THE MATTER OF ALSACE LORRAINE ADJUSTMENT OF ITALIAN FRONTIERS ALONG THE LINES OF NATIONALITY MORE LIBERTY FOR THE PEOPLES OF AUSTRIA HUNGARY THE RESTORATION OF SERBIA AND RUMANIA
IN JUNE THE VANGUARD OF THE ARMY REACHED FRANCE A SLOW AND STEADY STREAM FOLLOWED AS SOON AS THE MEN ENROLLED UNDER THE DRAFT WERE READY IT BECAME A FLOOD DURING THE PERIOD OF THE WAR THE ARMY WAS ENLARGED FROM ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND MEN
WITH A VIEW TO STOPPING SERBIAN AGITATION FOR INDEPENDENCE AUSTRIA HUNGARY LAID THE BLAME FOR THIS INCIDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT OF SERBIA AND MADE HUMILIATING DEMANDS ON THAT COUNTRY GERMANY AT ONCE PROPOSED THAT THE ISSUE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS
LABOR WAS GIVEN REPRESENTATION ON THE IMPORTANT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS DEALING WITH INDUSTRIAL QUESTIONS TRADE UNION STANDARDS WERE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND GENERALLY APPLIED IN INDUSTRY
AND NOTIFIED THE KING OF BELGIUM THAT THEY WERE PREPARING TO VIOLATE THE NEUTRALITY OF HIS REALM ON THEIR WAY TO PARIS ON THE SAME DAY GREAT BRITAIN ANXIOUSLY BESOUGHT BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT PROMISED THE AID OF THE BRITISH NAVY IF GERMAN WARSHIPS MADE HOSTILE DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE CHANNEL
EVERY MAN HE SAID WHO REALLY LOVES AMERICA WILL ACT AND SPEAK IN THE TRUE SPIRIT OF NEUTRALITY WHICH IS THE SPIRIT OF IMPARTIALITY AND FAIRNESS AND FRIENDLINESS TO ALL CONCERNED WE MUST BE IMPARTIAL IN THOUGHT AS WELL AS IN ACTION
WE COULD NOT HOWEVER IN THESE VITAL INTERESTS OF AUSTRIA HUNGARY WHICH WERE AT STAKE ADVISE OUR ALLY TO TAKE A YIELDING ATTITUDE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH HIS DIGNITY NOR DENY HIM OUR ASSISTANCE THAT MADE THE WAR INEVITABLE
ABSOLUTE FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION UPON THE SEAS THE REMOVAL AS FAR AS POSSIBLE OF TRADE BARRIERS AMONG NATIONS REDUCTION OF ARMAMENTS ADJUSTMENT OF COLONIAL CLAIMS IN THE INTEREST OF THE POPULATIONS CONCERNED FAIR AND FRIENDLY TREATMENT OF RUSSIA
ALL THE AGENCIES OF MODERN PUBLICITY BEING EMPLOYED TO ENLIST POPULAR INTEREST THE FIRST LOAN HAD FOUR AND A HALF MILLION SUBSCRIBERS THE FOURTH MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION COMBINED WITH LOANS WERE HEAVY TAXES
FOR MONTHS HE FILLED THE NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND PERIODICALS WITH INTERVIEWS ARTICLES AND NOTES ON THE JUSTICE OF THE TEUTONIC CAUSE FROM A PRESS BUREAU IN NEW YORK FLOWED A STREAM OF PAMPHLETS LEAFLETS AND CARTOONS A MAGAZINE THE FATHERLAND
A PROMISE OF UNITY LAY IN THE FACT THAT THE CONVENTIONS OF THE REPUBLICANS AND PROGRESSIVES WERE HELD SIMULTANEOUSLY IN CHICAGO THE FRIENDS OF ROOSEVELT HOPED THAT BOTH PARTIES WOULD SELECT HIM AS THEIR CANDIDATE BUT THIS HOPE WAS NOT REALIZED
INTERNATIONAL LAW PRESCRIBED THAT A PEACEFUL MERCHANT SHIP WHETHER BELONGING TO AN ENEMY OR TO A NEUTRAL COUNTRY SHOULD NOT BE DESTROYED OR SUNK WITHOUT PROVISION FOR THE SAFETY OF CREW AND PASSENGERS IN THE FOURTH PLACE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT A BELLIGERENT HAD THE RIGHT
THE ESPIONAGE AND SEDITION ACTS BY THE ESPIONAGE LAW OF JUNE FIFTEENTH NINETEEN SEVENTEEN AND THE AMENDING LAW KNOWN AS THE SEDITION ACT PASSED IN MAY OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE GOVERNMENT WAS GIVEN A DRASTIC POWER OVER THE EXPRESSION OF OPINION
BY THE FIRST ACT OF MAY EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN SEVENTEEN IT FIXED THE AGE LIMITS AT TWENTY ONE TO THIRTY ONE INCLUSIVE LATER IN AUGUST NINETEEN EIGHTEEN IT EXTENDED THEM TO EIGHTEEN AND FORTY FIVE
THE REPUBLICANS CHOSE AND THE PROGRESSIVES ACCEPTED CHARLES E HUGHES AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT WHO AS GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK HAD WON A NATIONAL REPUTATION BY WAGING WAR ON MACHINE POLITICIANS
ON THE GROUND THAT THEY EITHER WERE DESTINED ULTIMATELY TO GERMANY OR WOULD RELEASE GOODS FOR SALE TO GERMANS ON NOVEMBER SECOND NINETEEN FOURTEEN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE GERMANS WORE SOWING MINES IN OPEN WATERS AND THAT THEREFORE THE WHOLE OF THE NORTH SEA WAS A MILITARY ZONE
AND THE CROWN PRINCE WERE THE SYMBOLS OF ROYAL ARROGANCE ON THE OTHER HAND MANY AMERICANS OF GERMAN DESCENT IN MEMORY OF THEIR TIES WITH THE FATHERLAND OPENLY SYMPATHIZED WITH THE CENTRAL POWERS AND MANY AMERICANS OF IRISH DESCENT
THE SYMPATHIES OF A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE WITHOUT DOUBT ON THE SIDE OF GREAT BRITAIN AND FRANCE TO THEM THE INVASION OF THE LITTLE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM AND THE HORRORS THAT ACCOMPANIED GERMAN OCCUPATION WERE ODIOUS IN THE EXTREME MOREOVER
TWENTY FIVE MILES FROM OUR LINE OF DEPARTURE THE STRATEGICAL GOAL WHICH WAS OUR HIGHEST HOPE WAS GAINED WE HAD CUT THE ENEMY'S MAIN LINE OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NOTHING BUT A SURRENDER OR AN ARMISTICE COULD SAVE HIS ARMY FROM COMPLETE DISASTER
RENOMINATED PRESIDENT WILSON BY ACCLAMATION REVIEWED WITH PRIDE THE LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PARTY AND COMMENDED THE SPLENDID DIPLOMATIC VICTORIES OF OUR GREAT PRESIDENT WHO HAS PRESERVED THE VITAL INTERESTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND ITS CITIZENS AND KEPT US OUT OF WAR
HAD EVERY ABLE BODIED MAN IN SERVICE AND ALL THEIR RESOURCES HUMAN AND MATERIAL THROWN INTO THE SCALE FOR THIS REASON PRESIDENT WILSON SUMMONED THE WHOLE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE EVERY SACRIFICE NECESSARY FOR VICTORY
THE LUSITANIA NOTES ON MAY FOURTEENTH THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AT WASHINGTON MADE PUBLIC THE FIRST OF THREE FAMOUS NOTES ON THE LUSITANIA CASE IT SOLEMNLY INFORMED THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT THAT NO WARNING THAT AN UNLAWFUL AND INHUMANE ACT WILL BE COMMITTED
HE RODE AWAY FROM THE PARK WITH THE OLD REGRET IN HIS MIND THAT THE FORTUNES OF HIMSELF AND HIS FRIEND WERE THIS MORNING FINALLY SEVERED AS A FACT HE HAD THAT MORNING SET THE STRANDS OF A NEW ROPE A WEAVING
IT SEEMED STRANGE TO DURRANCE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT OF HIS GOOD LUCK
DURRANCE LEANED OUT OVER THE SIDE OF THE BOAT HARRY HE SHOUTED
THEN HOW DID YOU FIND OUT SHE ASKED I KNEW FROM TRENCH THAT HARRY FEVERSHAM WOULD COME SOME DAY AND SOON I PASSED THE CHURCH THIS AFTERNOON YOUR COLLIE DOG BARKED AT ME SO I KNEW YOU WERE INSIDE BUT A SADDLED HORSE WAS TIED UP BESIDE THE GATE
QUITE UNATTAINABLE AND OF GREAT GRIEFS TOO ETERNAL AND WITH A SORT OF NOBILITY BY REASON OF THEIR GREATNESS
I COULD NOT LET YOU WHO HAD SAID TWO LIVES MUST NOT BE SPOILT BECAUSE OF ME LIVE THROUGH A YEAR THINKING THAT TWO LIVES HAD BEEN SPOILT YOU ON YOUR SIDE DARED NOT LET ME WHO HAD SAID MARRIAGE BETWEEN A BLIND MAN AND A WOMAN IS ONLY POSSIBLE
DURRANCE STEPPED FROM THE DOVER PIER INTO THE MAIL BOAT FOR CALAIS IN SPITE OF THE RAIN AND THE GLOOMY NIGHT A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED TO GIVE THE GENERAL A SEND OFF AS THE ROPES WERE CAST OFF A FEEBLE CHEER WAS RAISED AND BEFORE THE CHEER HAD ENDED
BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK DURRANCE EXPLAINED ONCE IN THE CHURCH AGAIN UPON YOUR VIOLIN AND HE TOOK UP THE INSTRUMENT FROM THE CHAIR ON WHICH SHE HAD LAID IT
TRENCH WOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD ME OF THE FOURTH HAD I NOT KNOWN OF THE THREE FOR I SHOULD NOT HAVE MET HIM AS HE LANDED FROM THE STEAMER AT DOVER I SHOULD NOT HAVE ASKED HIM WHERE IS HARRY FEVERSHAM AND FOR ME TO KNOW OF THE THREE WAS ENOUGH
I COULD NEVER PITY A MAN WHO DIED ON ACTIVE SERVICE I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO COME BY THAT END MYSELF IT WAS A QUITE SIMPLE CREED CONSISTENT WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF THE MAN WHO UTTERED IT IT AMOUNTED TO NO MORE THAN THIS
I WANTED SO MUCH THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE DONE BY YOU ALONE WITHOUT ANYBODY'S HELP OR INTERFERENCE SHE SAID AND AFTER SHE HAD SPOKEN THERE FOLLOWED A SILENCE ONCE OR TWICE SHE LOOKED TOWARDS THE WALL AND EACH TIME SHE SAW THE SPACE OF GOLDEN LIGHT NARROWED
FEVERSHAM FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND SIDE BY SIDE THEY WENT RACING DOWN THE SAND
HE WAS VERY OLD SHE THOUGHT HE WOULD DIE SOON AND LEAVE HER AND THEN THERE WOULD BE YEARS AND YEARS PERHAPS BEFORE SHE LAY DOWN IN HER BED AND KNEW THE GREAT MOMENT WAS AT HAND THERE CAME A KNOCK UPON THE DOOR AND A SERVANT TOLD HER THAT COLONEL DURRANCE WAS WAITING
I HAVE KNOWN A LONG WHILE EVER SINCE CAPTAIN WILLOUGHBY CAME TO THE POOL WITH THE FIRST FEATHER I WAITED TO TELL YOU THAT I KNEW UNTIL HARRY FEVERSHAM CAME BACK AND HE CAME TO DAY
IT PASSED IN A CONTINUOUS HURRY OF PREPARATION SO THAT HIS NEWSPAPER LAY EACH DAY UNFOLDED IN HIS ROOMS THE GENERAL WAS TO TRAVEL OVERLAND TO BRINDISI AND SO ON AN EVENING OF WIND AND RAIN TOWARD THE END OF JULY
FOR SHE SURPRISED ALL WHO HAD FIRST HELD SPEECH WITH THE FATHER DURRANCE HAD STAYED FOR A NIGHT IN THE HOUSE AND THROUGH THAT EVENING SHE HAD PLAYED UPON HER VIOLIN SEATED WITH HER BACK TOWARD HER AUDIENCE AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN SHE PLAYED
SO SOME ONE ELSE WAS WITH YOU AND NOT ANY ONE FROM THE VILLAGE THEN I GOT YOU TO PLAY AND THAT TOLD ME WHO IT WAS WHO RODE THE HORSE YES
AND YET IT WAS NOBLY SAD IT WAS TRUE MUSIC IT DID NOT COMPLAIN HE LAID THE VIOLIN DOWN UPON THE CHAIR AGAIN I AM GOING TO SEND A MESSENGER TO RATHMULLEN HARRY CANNOT CROSS LOUGH SWILLY TO NIGHT THE MESSENGER WILL BRING HIM BACK TO MORROW
HE WAITED AT HALF PAST NINE BY THE CLUMP OF LILACS AND LABURNUMS AT THE END OF THE SAND
FROM THE TIME OF WILLOUGHBY'S COMING SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD NIGHT AND DAY TO THE ONE HALF HOUR DURING WHICH HARRY FEVERSHAM WOULD BE WITH HER THE HALF HOUR HAD COME AND PASSED SHE KNEW NOW HOW SHE HAD COUNTED UPON ITS COMING HOW SHE HAD LIVED FOR IT
DURRANCE FOUND HIMSELF BESET BY A STRANGE ILLUSION HE WAS LEANING UPON THE BULWARKS IDLY WONDERING WHETHER THIS WAS HIS LAST VIEW OF ENGLAND AND WITH A WISH THAT SOME ONE OF HIS FRIENDS HAD COME DOWN TO SEE HIM GO
WHEN I WENT TO LONDON TO SEE MY OCULIST IT WAS A RELIEF IT GAVE YOU A PAUSE A REST WHEREIN TO DROP PRETENCE AND BE YOURSELF
THAT ALL HER HEART AND SOUL WOULD CLAMOUR TO HER TO CALL HIM BACK AND SHE FORCED HERSELF AS SHE SAT SHIVERING BY THE FIRE TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS FORESEEN AND HAD ALWAYS LOOKED BEYOND IT
SHE TALKED WITH HER VISITOR AS THOUGH NO UNUSUAL THING HAD HAPPENED AN HOUR BEFORE SHE EVEN TALKED OF THEIR MARRIAGE AND THE REBUILDING OF LENNON HOUSE IT WAS DIFFICULT BUT SHE HAD GROWN USED TO DIFFICULTIES
YES THE MOMENT I WENT UPSTAIRS THAT NIGHT I PACKED UP YOUR PRESENTS AND ADDRESSED THEM TO YOUR ROOMS YES I GOT THEM IN LONDON BUT I PUT YOUR PHOTOGRAPH ASIDE FIRST OF ALL TO KEEP
HE ONLY SAW AGAIN HOWEVER THAT PUZZLING LOOK OF ENVY IN FEVERSHAM'S EYES YOU SEE THERE ARE WORSE THINGS WHICH CAN HAPPEN HE CONTINUED DISABLEMENT FOR INSTANCE CLEVER MEN COULD MAKE A SHIFT PERHAPS TO PUT UP WITH IT
WHICH HAD THE VERY SOB OF THE WAVES DURRANCE HAD LISTENED WONDERING FOR THE VIOLIN HAD SPOKEN TO HIM OF MANY THINGS OF WHICH THE GIRL WHO PLAYED IT COULD KNOW NOTHING IT HAD SPOKEN OF LONG PERILOUS JOURNEYS
AND LOOKING UP FOUND HIMSELF CLOSE BY THE RAILS HOW DO YOU DO MISSUS ADAIR SAID HE AND HE STOPPED HIS HORSE MISSUS ADAIR GAVE HIM HER HAND ACROSS THE RAILS SHE WAS DURRANCE'S NEIGHBOUR AT SOUTHPOOL
AND THEY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER ITS SUCCESSORS WOULD SUSTAIN ITS PROMISE THEY WERE LOOKING BACKWARD THROUGH THE LEAVES BEFORE THEY PUT IT FINALLY AWAY YOU MUST STAY WITH US JACK WHEN YOU COME BACK SAID FEVERSHAM DURRANCE HAD SCHOOLED HIMSELF NOT TO WINCE
YOU WENT AWAY JUST AFTER CAPTAIN WILLOUGHBY CAME WAS THAT THE REASON WHY YOU WENT AWAY I WENT BECAUSE NEITHER YOU NOR I COULD HAVE KEPT UP THE GAME OF PRETENCES WE WERE PLAYING YOU WERE PRETENDING THAT YOU HAD NO THOUGHT FOR HARRY FEVERSHAM
AT ALL EVENTS YOU ARE AT HOME AGAIN WITH THE RIGHT TO BE AT HOME
SHE ASKED IN A VOICE OF SUSPENSE YOU ARE SO SELDOM OFF YOUR GUARD ONLY INDEED AT RARE TIMES WHEN YOU PLAY ONCE BEFORE WHEN YOU PLAYED THAT OVERTURE YOU WERE OFF YOUR GUARD
HE HAD BEEN FETCHED AGAINST HIS WILL TO THE HOUSE BY THE LENNON RIVER IN DONEGAL
AND THE PECULIAR PALLOR ON HER FACE BUT AT THIS MOMENT THE FACE HAD BRIGHTENED THERE WAS A HINT OF COLOUR IN THE CHEEKS I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU SAID DURRANCE TWO SPECIAL ITEMS ONE HARRY FEVERSHAM IS TO BE MARRIED TO WHOM ASKED THE LADY EAGERLY
SHE FELT COLD THAT SUMMER EVENING AND HAD THE FIRE LIGHTED SHE SAT GAZING INTO THE BRIGHT COALS WITH THAT STILLNESS OF ATTITUDE WHICH WAS A SURE SIGN WITH HER OF TENSE EMOTION THE MOMENT SO EAGERLY LOOKED FOR HAD COME AND IT WAS OVER
THE SMALL THINGS WITH THEIR DAILY HAPPENINGS WERE JUST THOSE ABOUT WHICH SHE MUST BE MOST CAREFUL STILL I THINK THAT I CAN PLAY THE OVERTURE SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AND SHE TOOK DOWN HER VIOLIN SHE PLAYED THE OVERTURE THROUGH FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END
AND SO GO TO HIS GRAVE WITH HER REPROACHES RINGING IN HIS EARS HE REMEMBERED THAT PREDICTION OF HIS NOW AND KNEW THAT IT WAS FALSE THE WORDS HE WOULD HEAR WOULD BE THOSE WHICH SHE HAD JUST UTTERED FOR ETHNE'S PROPOSAL THAT THEY SHOULD SEPARATE HE WAS NOT UNPREPARED
SHE STOPPED AND FOR A WHILE THERE WAS SILENCE IN THAT CHURCH TO FEVERSHAM HER WORDS WERE GRACIOUS AS RAIN UPON DRY LAND TO HEAR HER SPEAK THEM UPLIFTED HIM SO THAT THOSE SIX YEARS OF TRIAL OF SLINKING INTO CORNERS OUT OF THE SIGHT OF HIS FELLOWS OF LONELY ENDURANCE
BUT I HAD ALREADY PUT YOUR PHOTOGRAPH ASIDE I HAVE IT NOW I SHALL KEEP IT AND THE FEATHERS TOGETHER SHE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT
THEREFORE IT WAS THAT AS HE RODE THE NEXT MORNING INTO THE ROW HIS BLUE EYES LOOKED OUT UPON THE WORLD FROM HIS BRONZED FACE WITH NOT A JOT LESS OF HIS USUAL FRIENDLINESS
SHE FELL TO WONDERING WHAT HARRY FEVERSHAM WOULD DO NOW THAT HE HAD RETURNED AND WHILE SHE WAS BUILDING UP FOR HIM A FUTURE OF GREAT DISTINCTION SHE FELT DERMOD'S OLD COLLIE DOG NUZZLING AT HER HAND WITH HIS SURE INSTINCT THAT HIS MISTRESS WAS IN DISTRESS
BUT I WAS ANXIOUS TO FIND OUT SOMETHING AND I KNEW NO OTHER WAY OF FINDING IT OUT
THERE CAME A LOOK OF ANXIETY INTO HER EYES AND THE COLOUR DIED OUT OF HER FACE YOU ARE VERY GLAD I SUPPOSE SHE SAID SLOWLY DURRANCE'S VOICE LEFT HER IN NO DOUBT
NOR INDEED FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS EVER SINCE THE TWO MEN HAD GRADUATED FROM OXFORD IT HAD BEEN THEIR CUSTOM TO MEET AT THIS SPOT AND HOUR WHEN BOTH CHANCED TO BE IN TOWN AND DURRANCE WAS PUZZLED
ON THE CONTRARY YOU SHOULD BE GLAD THAT I HAVE FOUND OUT GLAD SHE EXCLAIMED YES FOR MY SAKE GLAD AND AS SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN WONDERMENT HE WENT ON TWO LIVES SHOULD NOT BE SPOILT BECAUSE OF YOU HAD YOU HAD YOUR WAY HAD I NOT FOUND OUT
IT MIGHT HAVE COME GRADUALLY A SUSPICION ADDED TO A SUSPICION AND ANOTHER TO THAT UNTIL NO DOUBT WAS LEFT OR IT MIGHT HAVE FLASHED OUT IN ONE TERRIBLE MOMENT
WHEN THERE IS MORE THAN FRIENDSHIP ON BOTH SIDES KNOW THAT UPON ONE SIDE THERE WAS ONLY FRIENDSHIP AND WE WERE SO NEAR TO FAILING SO I WENT AWAY
AND WHEN AT LAST FEVERSHAM KEPT THE TRYST DURRANCE HAD NEWS
BUT THAT COULD BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT THE SIGNS OF EMOTION SO SHE SPOKE HER SPEECH LOOKING STEADILY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND SPEAKING IN AN EVEN VOICE I KNOW THAT YOU WILL MIND VERY MUCH JUST AS I DO BUT THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT SHE RESUMED
AND THE WORDS WERE READY TO HER LIPS AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF HARRY FEVERSHAM RECOVERED TO HER AFTER SO MANY YEARS SO MUCH SUSPENSE SO MUCH SUFFERING IT HAD SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE NEVER WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK THEM
BUT THE FIGURE BENEATH THE LAMP NEVER STIRRED
COMPARED WITH THE OTHER OUR FIRST PARTING OVER AT THE HOUSE SIX YEARS AGO I FELT VERY LONELY AFTER THAT AS I SHALL NOT FEEL LONELY NOW THERE WAS A GREAT BARRIER BETWEEN US THEN SEPARATING US FOREVER WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE MET AGAIN HERE OR AFTERWARDS
SO THAT GUESSENS EVEN WHEN HE HAD INHERITED IT WITH ITS FARMS AND LANDS HAD REMAINED ALWAYS IN HIS THOUGHTS AS A PLACE TO COME HOME TO RATHER THAN AN ESTATE TO OCCUPY A LIFE HE PURPOSELY EXAGGERATED THAT RESTLESSNESS NOW
HOWEVER NECESSARY IT WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE SPOKEN BUT AS THEY STOOD OVER AGAINST ONE ANOTHER SHE HAD FORCED HERSELF TO REMEMBER THAT NECESSITY UNTIL SHE ACTUALLY RECOGNISED AND FELT IT THEN SHE HAD GONE BACK INTO THE CHURCH AND TAKEN A SEAT AND GATHERED UP HER STRENGTH
DON'T GO FOR A MOMENT SHE SAID AND SHE LEFT THE FIREPLACE AND CAME TO THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM THE OCULIST AT WIESBADEN SHE ASKED HE GAVE YOU A HOPE DURRANCE STOOD MEDITATING WHETHER HE SHOULD LIE OR SPEAK THE TRUTH NO HE SAID AT LENGTH THERE IS NO HOPE
YES SHE SAID AND AS HE ENTERED THE ROOM SHE WENT FORWARD TO MEET HIM SHE DID NOT SHIRK THE PART WHICH SHE HAD ALLOTTED TO HERSELF SHE STEPPED OUT FROM THE SECRET CHAMBER OF HER GRIEF AS SOON AS SHE WAS SUMMONED
OR FROZE IN THE EASTER VACATIONS IN THE BIG SNOW GULLY ON GREAT END RETURNED FEVERSHAM BOTH MEN HAD THE FEELING THAT ON THIS MORNING A VOLUME IN THEIR BOOK OF LIFE WAS ENDED AND SINCE THE VOLUME HAD BEEN A PLEASANT ONE TO READ
BUT WHAT IN THE WORLD SHOULD I DO IF I HAD TO SIT IN A CHAIR ALL MY DAYS IT MAKES ME SHIVER TO THINK OF IT AND HE SHOOK HIS BROAD SHOULDERS TO UNSADDLE THAT FEAR WELL THIS IS THE LAST RIDE LET US GALLOP AND HE LET OUT HIS HORSE
TO MORROW SHE WOULD KNOW AGAIN THAT THEY HAD NOT PARTED FOREVER TO MORROW SHE WOULD COMPARE THE PARTING OF TO DAY WITH THE PARTING ON THE NIGHT OF THE BALL AT LENNON HOUSE AND RECOGNISE WHAT A SMALL THING THIS WAS TO THAT
WHEN IT SEEMED TO HIM SUDDENLY THAT HIS WISH WAS ANSWERED FOR HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A MAN STANDING BENEATH A GAS LAMP AND THAT MAN WAS OF THE STATURE AND WORE THE LIKENESS OF HARRY FEVERSHAM
TO NIGHT SO SOON THEY TURNED THEIR HORSES AND RODE WESTWARD AGAIN DOWN THE ALLEY OF TREES THE MORNING WAS STILL FRESH THE LIMES AND CHESTNUTS HAD LOST NOTHING OF THEIR EARLY GREEN
AND I INTRODUCED HIM HE HAS BEEN IMPROVING THE ACQUAINTANCE IN DUBLIN BUT MISSUS ADAIR ALREADY UNDERSTOOD AND IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE NEWS WAS WELCOME
ONLY THAT NIGHT DURRANCE MADE HER PATH A LITTLE HARDER TO TREAD HE ASKED HER AFTER THE MAID HAD BROUGHT IN THE TEA TO PLAY TO HIM THE MUSOLINE OVERTURE UPON HER VIOLIN NOT TO NIGHT SAID ETHNE I
DURRANCE SPOKE THEM WITH A SMILE UPON HIS FACE IT TOOK HER A LONG TIME TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY SPOKEN THEM SHE WAS NOT SURE AT THE FIRST THAT HER OVERSTRAINED SENSES WERE NOT PLAYING HER TRICKS BUT HE REPEATED HIS QUESTION
IT WAS NOT RIGHT I HAD FORGOTTEN THE WORDS OH A LONG TIME SINCE UNTIL COLONEL TRENCH REMINDED ME I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN THEM WHEN I DID I WAS NOT THINKING THEY WOULD LIVE SO IN YOUR THOUGHTS I AM SORRY THAT I SPOKE THEM OH THEY WERE JUST ENOUGH
BUT WHAT WHEN WE CAME TO LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF AND THERE WERE NO VISITS TO THE OCULIST WHEN WE SAW EACH OTHER EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY SOONER OR LATER THE TRUTH MUST HAVE COME TO ME
DURRANCE RUBBED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AGAIN BUT THE WIND MADE THE TONGUE OF LIGHT FLICKER UNCERTAINLY WITHIN THE GLASS THE RAIN TOO
STILL KEPT HIM AT HER SIDE THOUGH SHE SAT SO CALMLY AND STILL THOUGH HER FACE WAS QUIET IN ITS LOOK OF GRAVITY HER HEART ACHED WITH LONGING JUST FOR A LITTLE LONGER SHE PLEADED TO HERSELF THE SUNLIGHT WAS WITHDRAWING FROM THE WALLS OF THE CHURCH
OF MANY HEART SINKINGS AND MUCH BODILY PAIN DWINDLED AWAY INTO INSIGNIFICANCE THEY HAD INDEED BORNE THEIR FRUIT TO HIM
THE ARMY THE SPECIAL SERVICE IN THE STRANGE QUARTERS OF THE WORLD A FINE COMPENSATION TO SIT IN FRONT OF YOU KNOWING YOU HAD MARRIED A CRIPPLE OUT OF PITY
AND THAT IN SO DOING YOU HAD CRIPPLED YOURSELF AND FOREGONE THE HAPPINESS WHICH IS YOURS BY RIGHT WHEREAS NOW WHEREAS NOW SHE REPEATED I REMAIN YOUR FRIEND
AND SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN BEFORE SHE CHANGED HER MIND
I SHOULD THINK I WAS I GO SOON TOO AND THE SOONER THE BETTER I WILL COME AND DINE SOME NIGHT IF I MAY BEFORE I GO MY HUSBAND WILL BE PLEASED TO SEE YOU SAID MISSUS ADAIR RATHER COLDLY DURRANCE DID NOT NOTICE THE COLDNESS HOWEVER
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CLASH PERHAPS IT WAS AS WELL THAT HARRY FEVERSHAM WAS TO MARRY ETHNE AND NOT ANOTHER THAN FEVERSHAM THUS AT ALL EVENTS HE ARGUED AS HE RODE UNTIL THE RIDERS VANISHED FROM BEFORE HIS EYES
AND TOOK THE BRIGHT COLOUR OF HONEY AND UPON THE EMPTY SAND BLACK STONES BEGAN TO HEAP THEMSELVES SHAPELESSLY LIKE COAL AND TO FLASH IN THE SUN LIKE MIRRORS HE WAS DEEP IN HIS ANTICIPATIONS OF THE SOUDAN WHEN HE HEARD HIS NAME CALLED OUT SOFTLY IN A WOMAN'S VOICE
HIS WORDS TOOK HER BREATH AWAY AND THE COLOUR FROM HER CHEEKS SHE GOT UP SLOWLY FROM HER CHAIR AND STARED AT HIM WIDE EYED HE COULD NOT KNOW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE DID NOT KNOW BUT DURRANCE WENT QUIETLY ON WELL DID YOU TAKE BACK YOUR FEATHER THE FOURTH ONE
SHE WAS STUNNED BY DURRANCE'S UNEXPECTED DISCLOSURE SHE HAD SO CAREFULLY GUARDED HER SECRET THAT TO REALISE THAT FOR A YEAR IT HAD BEEN NO SECRET CAME AS A SHOCK TO HER BUT EVEN IN THE MIDST OF HER CONFUSION SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE MUST HAVE TIME
I CAN GET ABOUT CAN'T I PERHAPS ONE OF THESE DAYS I SHALL GO ON A JOURNEY ONE OF THE LONG JOURNEYS AMONGST THE STRANGE PEOPLE IN THE EAST
I GO OUT TO EGYPT ON GENERAL GRAHAM'S STAFF
DURRANCE MEANWHILE WALKED TO HIS LODGING ALONE REMEMBERING A DAY NOW TWO YEARS SINCE
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO IN THE CHURCH AT GLENALLA
BECAUSE OF YOUR LOYALTY THREE YOURS YES YES YOURS FEVERSHAM'S AND MINE IT WAS HARD ENOUGH TO KEEP THE PRETENCE DURING THE FEW WEEKS WE WERE IN DEVONSHIRE
I AM GLAD THAT YOU REMEMBERED OUR DRIVE AND WHAT WE SAID SHE CONTINUED IT IS RATHER IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU SHOULD REMEMBER
AND SHE COULD NO LONGER DISBELIEVE OR MISUNDERSTAND WHO TOLD YOU OF ANY FOURTH FEATHER SHE ASKED TRENCH HE ANSWERED I MET HIM AT DOVER BUT HE ONLY TOLD ME OF THE FOURTH FEATHER SAID DURRANCE I KNEW OF THE THREE BEFORE
SHE WAS PREPARED TO DISCUSS AT LENGTH WITH HIM EVEN THE POLITICS OF THE SOUDAN BUT HE WAITED FOR HER I AM GOING TO BE MARRIED SHE SAID AT LENGTH AND IMMEDIATELY I AM TO MARRY A FRIEND OF YOURS COLONEL DURRANCE THERE WAS HARDLY A PAUSE BEFORE FEVERSHAM ANSWERED HE HAS CARED FOR YOU A LONG WHILE
BUT THERE ARE OTHER MUCH GREATER REASONS FROM WHICH WE CAN BOTH TAKE COMFORT COLONEL TRENCH TOLD ME ENOUGH OF YOUR CAPTIVITY TO CONVINCE ME THAT WE BOTH SEE WITH THE SAME EYES WE BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT THIS SECOND PARTING HARD AS IT IS IS STILL A VERY SLIGHT SMALL THING
SO THAT HE UTTERED IT WITHOUT MELANCHOLY OR ANY SIGN OF FOREBODING EVEN SO HOWEVER HE HAD A FEAR THAT PERHAPS HIS FRIEND MIGHT PLACE ANOTHER INTERPRETATION UPON THE WORDS AND HE LOOKED QUICKLY INTO HIS FACE
WHICH TROUBLED HER BUT SHE FELT THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE SUCCEEDED SINCE BY FAILURE SHE HAD ROBBED HIM OF HIS LAST CHANCE OF HAPPINESS THERE LAY THE STING FOR HER BUT IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT HE SAID ONCE OR TWICE AS I SAID YOU WERE OFF YOUR GUARD
SO SHE DEFERRED THE MOMENT OF HIS GOING BY SILENCES AND SLOW SPEECH IT MIGHT BE SO VERY LONG BEFORE THAT END CAME SHE HAD SHE THOUGHT THE RIGHT TO PROTRACT THIS ONE INTERVIEW SHE RATHER HOPED THAT HE WOULD SPEAK OF HIS TRAVELS HIS DANGERS
THAT NIGHT SAID DURRANCE TURNING IN HIS SADDLE AFTER WE HAD GONE YES SAID FEVERSHAM ACCEPTING THE CORRECTION HE WONDERED WHETHER IT HAD BEEN INTENDED BUT DURRANCE RODE SILENTLY FORWARD
WHICH WAS TO BRING THEM TOGETHER AGAIN IN A STRANGE AND TERRIBLE RELATIONSHIP MISSUS ADAIR FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE PARK AND WALKED HOME VERY THOUGHTFULLY DURRANCE HAD JUST ONE WEEK WHEREIN TO PROVIDE HIS EQUIPMENT AND ARRANGE HIS ESTATE IN DEVONSHIRE
UNDER A CLEAR SKY IN A HIGH GARDEN OF DONEGAL BUT EVEN AS HE WAS TURNING FROM THE BULWARKS THERE CAME A LULL OF THE WIND THE LIGHTS BURNED BRIGHT AND STEADY ON THE PIER AND THE FACE LEAPED FROM THE SHADOWS DISTINCT IN FEATURE AND EXPRESSION
SHE WAS ALONE NOW IN HER REMOTE LITTLE VILLAGE OUT OF THE WORLD IN THE HILLS AND MORE ALONE THAN SHE HAD BEEN SINCE WILLOUGHBY SAILED ON THAT AUGUST MORNING DOWN THE SALCOMBE ESTUARY
THAT YOUR REGIMENT HAS TO STAY BEHIND FEVERSHAM RODE BY HIS FRIEND'S SIDE IN SILENCE THEN AS THEY CAME TO THE CHAIRS BENEATH THE TREES HE SAID THAT WAS EXPECTED THE DAY YOU DINED WITH ME I SENT IN MY PAPERS
AND THE LADIES IN THEIR COLOURED FROCKS BENEATH THE COOL OF THE TREES THE TREES THEMSELVES DWINDLED TO RAGGED MIMOSAS
HE HAD HIS OWN REASONS FOR MAKING THE MOST OF THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH HAD COME HIS WAY AND HE URGED HIS ENTHUSIASM AND LAID IT BARE IN WORDS MORE FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT THAN WITH ANY THOUGHT OF MISSUS ADAIR INDEED HE HAD ALWAYS RATHER A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF THE LADY
I NEVER BLAMED YOU FOR THEM SAID FEVERSHAM WITH A LAUGH
AND FEVERSHAM TOOK HIS STAND BESIDE HER IT WAS VERY QUIET AND PEACEFUL WITHIN THAT TINY CHURCH THE AFTERNOON SUN SHONE THROUGH THE UPPER WINDOWS AND MADE A GOLDEN HAZE ABOUT THE ROOF THE NATURAL MURMURS OF THE SUMMER FLOATED PLEASANTLY THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR
IT WAS A DELIGHT TO HIM TO MAKE DISCOVERIES WHICH NO ONE EXPECTED A MAN WHO HAD LOST HIS SIGHT TO MAKE AND TO ANNOUNCE THEM UNEXPECTEDLY IT WAS AN ADDITIONAL PLEASURE TO RELATE TO HIS PUZZLED AUDIENCE THE STEPS BY WHICH HE HAD REACHED HIS DISCOVERY NOT ONE OF YOUR CONJECTURES IS RIGHT
MOREOVER SHE WAS FRIENDLY AND AT THAT POINT DURRANCE'S KNOWLEDGE OF HER CAME TO AN END PERHAPS HER CHIEF MERIT IN HIS EYES WAS THAT SHE HAD MADE FRIENDS WITH ETHNE EUSTACE BUT HE WAS TO BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH MISSUS ADAIR
SHE HAD BARELY LISTENED TO HIS WORDS YES I SEE THEN IN A DEFINITE VOICE WHICH SHOWED THAT SHE HAD REGAINED ALL HER SELF CONTROL SHE SAID
AND THE FACES OF STRANGE COUNTRIES OF THE SILVER WAY ACROSS MOONLIT SEAS OF THE BECKONING VOICES FROM THE UNDER EDGES OF THE DESERT IT HAD TAKEN A DEEPER A MORE MYSTERIOUS TONE
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD LOST HIS FRIEND AS WELL
THE INCREDIBLE WORDS WERE SPOKEN THAT EVENING
DURRANCE HAD HIS VANITIES LIKE OTHERS AND IN PARTICULAR ONE VANITY WHICH HAD SPRUNG UP WITHIN HIM SINCE HE HAD BECOME BLIND HE PRIDED HIMSELF UPON THE QUICKNESS OF HIS PERCEPTION
AND KNEW THAT HER MINUTES WERE RUNNING OUT YOU SUFFERED HORRIBLY AT DONGOLA SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE COLONEL TRENCH TOLD ME WHAT DOES IT MATTER NOW FEVERSHAM ANSWERED THAT TIME SEEMS RATHER FAR AWAY TO ME HAD YOU ANYTHING OF MINE WITH YOU I HAD YOUR WHITE FEATHER
THAT YOU HARDLY CARED WHETHER HE WAS ALIVE OR DEAD I WAS PRETENDING NOT TO HAVE FOUND OUT THAT BEYOND EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD YOU CARED FOR HIM SOME DAY OR OTHER WE SHOULD HAVE FAILED EACH ONE IN TURN I DARED NOT FAIL NOR DARED YOU
IT WAS ONLY I WHO FAILED SHE BLAMED HERSELF MOST BITTERLY SHE HAD SET HERSELF AS THE ONE THING WORTH DOING AND INCUMBENT ON HER TO DO TO GUARD THIS MAN FROM KNOWLEDGE WHICH WOULD SET THE CROWN ON HIS CALAMITIES AND SHE HAD FAILED
SO THAT ALTHOUGH WE SHALL NOT SEE ONE ANOTHER HERE AND AS LONG AS WE LIVE THE AFTERWARDS IS QUITE SURE FOR US BOTH AND WE CAN WAIT FOR THAT YOU CAN YOU HAVE WAITED WITH SO MUCH STRENGTH ALL THESE YEARS SINCE WE PARTED AND I CAN TOO FOR I GET STRENGTH FROM YOUR VICTORY
STILL HEARING HER VOICE THOUGH THE VOICE HAD CEASED LONG AGO THERE WERE CERTAIN BITTER WORDS WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN AND HE HAD TOLD SUTCH SO CLOSELY HAD THEY CLUNG AND STUNG THAT HE BELIEVED IN HIS DYING MOMENTS HE WOULD HEAR THEM AGAIN
YOU WILL BE ONE OF THE ABSENT FRIENDS WHOM I SHALL NOT LOSE BECAUSE YOU ARE ABSENT SHE SPOKE SLOWLY LOOKING STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER WITHOUT FALTERING IT WAS A DIFFICULT SPEECH FOR HER TO DELIVER
HE HAD SET HIMSELF TO PROTECT HER FROM THE COMPREHENSION THAT SHE HAD FAILED AND HE HAD SUCCEEDED IT WAS NOT ANY MERE SENSE OF HUMILIATION
HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE CRIED IN A KIND OF DESPAIR AND COMING CLOSE TO HER HE TOOK GENTLY HOLD OF HER ARM BUT SINCE I KNOW HE PROTESTED WHAT DOES IT MATTER HOW I KNOW
I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD GET YOU TO PLAY IT AGAIN TO NIGHT THE OVERTURE WHICH WAS ONCE STRUMMED OUT IN A DINGY CAFE AT WADI HALFA TO NIGHT AGAIN I SHOULD FIND YOU OFF YOUR GUARD
TO GATHER UP HER FACULTIES AGAIN UNDER COMMAND SO SHE SPOKE OF THE UNIMPORTANT THING TO GAIN THE TIME YOU WERE IN THE CHURCH THEN OR YOU HEARD US UPON THE STEPS OR YOU MET HIM AS HE RODE AWAY NOT ONE OF THE CONJECTURES IS RIGHT SAID DURRANCE WITH A SMILE
AGAIN HARRY FEVERSHAM WAS CONSCIOUS OF A REPROACH IN HIS FRIEND'S SILENCE AND AGAIN HE WAS WRONG FOR DURRANCE SUDDENLY SPOKE HEARTILY AND WITH A LAUGH I REMEMBER YOU GAVE US YOUR REASONS THAT NIGHT
YOU SENT HARRY AWAY THIS AFTERNOON SAID DURRANCE YOU SAID GOOD BYE TO HIM TWICE
I STOOD AT THE WINDOW WHILE YOU PLAYED IT
DURRANCE STOOD AT THE WINDOW WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS HER UNTIL SHE HAD ENDED THEN HE WALKED TO HER SIDE I WAS RATHER A BRUTE HE SAID QUIETLY TO ASK YOU TO PLAY THAT OVERTURE TO NIGHT I WASN'T ANXIOUS TO PLAY SHE ANSWERED AS SHE LAID THE VIOLIN ASIDE I KNOW
THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT IT I AM GLAD AND THE LADY SIGHED AS THOUGH WITH RELIEF WHAT IS YOUR SECOND ITEM AS GOOD AS THE FIRST I GO OUT ON GENERAL GRAHAM'S STAFF MISSUS ADAIR WAS SILENT
IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR BOTH OF THEM SHE THOUGHT IF SHE SHOULD GIVE NO SIGN OF WHAT SO QUICK A SEPARATION COST HER HE WOULD KNOW SURELY ENOUGH AND SHE WISHED HIM TO KNOW SHE WISHED HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ONE MOMENT OF HIS SIX YEARS
SO IT SEEMED TO HIM NOW WHEN HE KNEW THAT HER FACE WAS STILL TO BE TURNED AWAY FOR ALL HIS DAYS HE HAD DRAWN A THOUGHT FROM HER PLAYING WHICH HE WAS AT SOME PAINS TO KEEP DEFINITE IN HIS MIND THE TRUE MUSIC CANNOT COMPLAIN
SHE MEASURED OUT A SPACE UPON THE WALLS WHERE IT STILL GLOWED BRIGHT WHEN ALL THAT SPACE WAS COLD GREY STONE SHE WOULD SEND HARRY FEVERSHAM AWAY I AM GLAD THAT YOU ESCAPED FROM OMDURMAN WITHOUT THE HELP OF LIEUTENANT SUTCH OR COLONEL DURRANCE
IN THE NILE VILLAGES IN THE DIM WIDE SPACES OF THE DESERT
YOU AIMED AT A COMPENSATION
WHEN ONCE HE HAD PASSED THROUGH THAT CHURCH DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE SUNLIGHT AND THE SUMMER MURMURS CAME AND HIS SHADOW GONE FROM THE THRESHOLD SHE WOULD NEVER TALK WITH HIM OR SET HER EYES ON HIM UNTIL HER LIFE WAS ENDED
I WAS NOT AWARE OF IT UNTIL I WENT AWAY BUT THINKING OVER EVERYTHING I THOUGHT IT LIKELY AND IN A VERY LITTLE TIME I BECAME SURE HE IS BLIND BLIND EXCLAIMED FEVERSHAM HE OF ALL MEN BLIND
BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T HELP WISHING THAT WE HAD BEEN GOING OUT TOGETHER
AND PURPOSELY SET AGAINST IT WORDS WHICH FEVERSHAM HAD SPOKEN AND WHICH HE KNEW TO BE TRUE ETHNE EUSTACE WOULD HARDLY BE HAPPY OUTSIDE HER COUNTY OF DONEGAL THEREFORE EVEN HAD THINGS FALLEN OUT DIFFERENTLY AS HE PHRASED IT
AND SINCE THE MAY WAS LATE THAT YEAR ITS BLOSSOMS STILL HUNG DELICATELY WHITE LIKE SNOW UPON THE BRANCHES AND SHONE RED AGAINST THE DARK RHODODENDRONS
HIS BLINDNESS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING
HE HAD HEARD ALREADY THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED AND HE DID NOT ARGUE AGAINST HER WISH BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE HAD MORE TO SAY TO HIM AND SHE HAD BUT SHE WAS SLOW TO SPEAK IT THIS WAS THE LAST TIME SHE WAS TO SEE HARRY FEVERSHAM SHE MEANT RESOLUTELY TO SEND HIM AWAY
IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM TO TALK OF HIS TRAVELS OR ADVENTURES THE OCCASION SEEMED TOO SERIOUS TOO VITAL THEY WERE TOGETHER TO DECIDE THE MOST SOLEMN ISSUE IN THEIR LIVES ONCE THE DECISION WAS MADE AS NOW IT HAD BEEN MADE HE FELT THAT THEY COULD HARDLY TALK ON OTHER TOPICS
A DESIRE TO SAIL DOWN THAT CREEK AND OUT OVER THE LEVELS OF THE SEA A DREAM OF QUEER OUTLANDISH COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES BEYOND THE DARK FAMILIAR WOODS AND THE RESTLESSNESS HAD GROWN UPON HIM
AS DURRANCE BENT DOWN TOWARDS HER HE BECAME AWARE THAT SHE WAS CRYING SILENTLY FOR ONCE TEARS HAD THEIR WAY WITH HER HE TOOK HIS CAP AND WALKED NOISELESSLY TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM
THE PARK SHIMMERED IN A HAZE OF SUNLIGHT AND THE DISTANT ROAR OF THE STREETS WAS AS THE TUMBLING OF RIVER WATER IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE WE BATHED IN SANDFORD LASHER SAID DURRANCE
I HAD NO RIGHT TO ANYTHING SAID FEVERSHAM THERE WAS STILL A NARROW SLIP OF GOLD UPON THE GREY SPACE OF STONE WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW SHE ASKED I SHALL GO HOME FIRST AND SEE MY FATHER IT WILL DEPEND UPON THE WAY WE MEET YOU WILL LET COLONEL DURRANCE KNOW
SHE FELT LONELY IN A RATHER EMPTY WORLD BUT IT WAS PART OF HER NATURE THAT SHE HAD FORESEEN THIS SENSE OF LONELINESS SHE HAD KNOWN THAT THERE WOULD BE A BAD HOUR FOR HER AFTER SHE HAD SENT HARRY FEVERSHAM AWAY
BUT ANYTHING ELSE ANY LITTLE THING WHICH I HAD GIVEN YOU IN THE OTHER DAYS NOTHING I HAD YOUR PHOTOGRAPH SHE SAID I KEPT IT FEVERSHAM SUDDENLY LEANED DOWN TOWARDS HER YOU DID ETHNE NODDED HER HEAD
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IT YES I WILL WRITE TO DURRANCE THE SLIP OF GOLD WAS GONE THE CLEAR LIGHT OF A SUMMER EVENING FILLED THE CHURCH A LIGHT WITHOUT RADIANCE OR ANY COLOUR
HE COULD ONLY VAGUELY DISTINGUISH BENEATH THE LAMP THE WHITENESS OF A FACE IT WAS AN ILLUSION HE SAID TO HIMSELF
DURRANCE TURNED BACK AND WALKED HIS HORSE UP TOWARD THE SEATS BENEATH THE TREES EVEN AS A BOY IN HIS HOME AT SOUTHPOOL IN DEVONSHIRE UPON A WOODED CREEK OF THE SALCOMBE ESTUARY HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSCIOUS OF A CERTAIN RESTLESSNESS
BUT THE CONVINCING FACTS WERE NOT REVEALED TO ME IN THAT WAY WHEN YOU PLAYED THE MUSOLINE OVERTURE BEFORE ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY WHEN WILLOUGHBY BROUGHT YOU SUCH GOOD NEWS I TOOK TO MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS OF YOURS WHICH INSPIRED YOUR PLAYING YOU MUST NOT BLAME YOURSELF
THE MELODIES WHICH SHE HAD PLAYED RANG IN HIS EARS NOW FOR THE GIRL POSSESSED THE GIFT OF MUSIC AND THE STRINGS OF HER VIOLIN SPOKE TO THE QUESTIONS OF HER BOW THERE WAS IN PARTICULAR AN OVERTURE THE MELUSINE OVERTURE
I AM QUITE SURE OF THAT BUT YOU HAVE BROKEN THE BARRIER DOWN BY ALL YOUR PAIN AND BRAVERY DURING THESE LAST YEARS I AM NO LESS SURE OF THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT ABOUT IT AND I BELIEVE YOU ARE TOO
AND HE DID NOT EVEN AT THAT ANTICIPATORY US IF HIS LEFT HAND TIGHTENED UPON THE THONGS OF HIS REINS THE SIGN COULD NOT BE DETECTED BY HIS FRIEND IF I COME BACK SAID DURRANCE YOU KNOW MY CREED
LUNCHEON AWAITED THEM BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER TO ARRIVE AT AN UNDERSTANDING BEFORE THEY SAT DOWN TO THE MEAL SHE ENTERED THE ROOM AND FOUND LOUISE LEANING ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR I DARE SAY YOU HEARD THE ROW MISS DERRICK REMARKED COLDLY I'M VERY SORRY
HE WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO THE FOUR CASTAWAYS REMAINED MOTIONLESS LOOKING UNEASILY AT EACH OTHER HERBERT WAS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE BY SAYING MISTER SPILETT YOU ARE A SMOKER AND ALWAYS HAVE MATCHES ABOUT YOU
BUT HE SAW DANGER ALIKE IN DISCLOSURE AND IN RETICENCE WHEN THERE ENTERS THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBILITY OF JEALOUSY A MAN CAN NEVER BE SURE THAT HIS WIFE WILL ACT AS A RATIONAL BEING
BUT HE REFUSED THEM HE COULD NOT WOULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT HIS MASTER AS TO GIDEON SPILETT HE DEVOURED THE SHELL FISH THEN HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON THE SAND AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK HE WAS VERY WEAK BUT CALM HERBERT WENT UP TO HIM AND TAKING HIS HAND
AND THEN WALK ABOUT YOU MUST BE DREADFULLY TIRED ALREADY JUST A LITTLE BUT I DON'T MIND IT SERVES ME RIGHT I SHALL BE SO GRATEFUL TO YOU MISTER MUMFORD
HE SEIZED IT WITH HIS FINGERS THROUGH THE STUFF BUT HE COULD NOT GET IT OUT IF THIS WAS A MATCH AND A SINGLE ONE IT WAS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT TO RUB OFF THE PHOSPHORUS WILL YOU LET ME TRY SAID THE BOY AND VERY CLEVERLY WITHOUT BREAKING IT
AND QUITE CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF HERSELF OR AT ALL EVENTS OUGHT TO BE PERHAPS THIS WAS THE ONLY POSSIBLE ISSUE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN WHICH THEY HAD ALL BECOME INVOLVED NEITHER LOUISE NOR HER PARENTS COULD BE DEALT WITH IN THE RATIONAL PEACEFUL WAY PREFERRED BY WELL CONDITIONED PEOPLE
AND WITH NO LESS APPREHENSION HE DECIDED AT LENGTH TO KEEP THE SECRET WHICH MIGHT SO EASILY BECOME KNOWN HEREAFTER AND WOULD THEN HAVE SUCH DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCES WELL LET US HAVE DINNER EMMY I'M HUNGRY
IN ANOTHER DIRECTION THE DOWNS WERE EDGED WITH TREES AND THAT WAY SHE TURNED ALL BUT OVERCOME WITH HEAT AND WEARINESS SHE AT LENGTH FOUND A SHADED SPOT WHERE HER SOLITUDE SEEMED SECURE AND AFTER SEATING HERSELF
WELL IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PROCEEDING AND MUCH USED IN THE ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC I DON'T DENY IT REPLIED PENCROFT BUT THE SAVAGES MUST KNOW HOW TO DO IT OR EMPLOY A PECULIAR WOOD FOR MORE THAN ONCE I HAVE TRIED TO GET FIRE IN THAT WAY BUT I COULD NEVER MANAGE IT
IT IS USELESS TO SAY THAT THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE PASSAGES WERE RANSACKED BEFORE THEY WERE OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP IN DESPAIR TOWARDS SIX O'CLOCK WHEN THE SUN WAS DISAPPEARING BEHIND THE HIGH LANDS OF THE WEST HERBERT WHO WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN ON THE STRAND
MISTER HIGGINS SAYS THAT IF I DON'T COME HOME HE WON'T LET ME HAVE ANY MORE MONEY THEY'RE GOING TO WRITE AND TELL YOU THAT THEY WON'T BE RESPONSIBLE AFTER THIS FOR MY BOARD AND LODGING OF COURSE I SHALL NOT GO HOME I SHOULDN'T DREAM OF IT I'D RATHER EARN MY LIVING AS
AFTER ALL MISSUS MUMFORD'S KINDNESS TO ME AND YOURS I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD BE SO HORRID
AND REALLY AFTER ALL I AM SO GLAD WAS HER CONCLUSION I DIDN'T THINK SHE HAD REALLY GONE ALL THE AFTERNOON I'VE BEEN EXPECTING TO SEE HER BACK AGAIN BUT SHE WON'T COME NOW AND IT IS A GOOD THING TO HAVE DONE WITH THE WRETCHED BUSINESS
VERY LIKELY REPLIED THE SEAMAN
THE SUN'S MOVEMENTS HAVING ROBBED HER OF SHADOW SHE ROSE LOOKED AT HER WATCH AND GLANCED AROUND FOR ANOTHER RETREAT HARD BY WAS A LITTLE WOOD DELIGHTFULLY GRASSY AND COOL FENCED ABOUT WITH RAILINGS SHE COULD EASILY HAVE CLIMBED
THOUGH PERHAPS UNWILLING TO ADMIT IT EVEN IN HER OWN SILLY MIND IT MIGHT BE SO AND IF SO IT MADE HER MORE INTERESTING FOR ONE WAS TEMPTED TO THINK THAT LOUISE HAD NOT THE POWER OF LOVING AT ALL
LOUISE KEEPING A VERY GRAVE COUNTENANCE TOLD HIM RAPIDLY ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN SINCE HIS DEPARTURE FROM HOME IN THE MORNING I BEHAVED HORRIDLY
SURELY HERBERT YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING A TINDER BOX ANYTHING THAT CAN POSSIBLY MAKE FIRE NO I HAVEN'T PENCROFT THE SAILOR RUSHED OUT FOLLOWED BY THE BOY
THESE POOR PEOPLE THOUGHT THEMSELVES WELL OFF AND WERE MUCH STRENGTHENED BY THEM OH IF ONLY ONE OF THEM HAD NOT BEEN MISSING AT THIS MEAL IF THE FIVE PRISONERS WHO ESCAPED FROM RICHMOND HAD BEEN ALL THERE UNDER THE PILED UP ROCKS
AND SHE WALKED ABOUT IN AN IRRESOLUTE MOOD FOR ONE THING SHE FELT HUNGRY AT SUTTON HER APPETITE HAD BEEN KEEN AND MEAL TIMES WERE ALWAYS WELCOME SHE ENTERED THE REFRESHMENT ROOM
HE RETURNED TO THE PLATEAU WENT OVER IT IN EVERY DIRECTION SEARCHED AMONG THE HIGH GRASS ON THE BORDER OF THE FOREST ALL IN VAIN IT WAS FIVE IN THE EVENING WHEN HE AND HERBERT RE ENTERED THE CAVE
THEY WERE RETURNING ALONE THE BOY'S HEART SANK THE SAILOR HAD NOT BEEN DECEIVED IN HIS FOREBODINGS THE ENGINEER CYRUS HARDING HAD NOT BEEN FOUND THE REPORTER ON HIS ARRIVAL SAT DOWN ON A ROCK WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING
IN A FRIENDLY TONE BUT AS IT WERE FROM A DISTANCE I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO ME A GREAT KINDNESS MISSUS MUMFORD THERE WAS NO REPLY THE GIRL PAUSED A MOMENT THEN RESUMED IMPULSIVELY
PENCROFT'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO USE THE FIRE BY PREPARING A MORE NOURISHING SUPPER THAN A DISH OF SHELL FISH TWO DOZEN EGGS WERE BROUGHT BY HERBERT THE REPORTER LEANING UP IN A CORNER WATCHED THESE PREPARATIONS WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING
YET FOR HIS OWN PART HE COULDN'T HELP LIKING HER THE EYES THAT HAD LOOKED INTO HIS AT THE STATION HAUNTED HIM A LITTLE AND WOULD NOT LET HIM THINK OF HER CONTEMPTUOUSLY BUT WHAT A WOMAN TO MAKE ONES WIFE UNLESS UNLESS
AND SHE FELT SURE THAT CLARENCE WOULD BE EXASPERATED IF HER WEAKNESS PROLONGED IT NOW DO LET ME ADVISE YOU LOUISE SHE ANSWERED GENTLY ARE YOU ACTING WISELY WOULDN'T IT BE VERY MUCH BETTER TO GO HOME LOUISE LOST ALL HER SELF CONTROL
I ONLY HOPE SHE WILL TELL THE TRUTH TO HER PEOPLE SHE MIGHT SAY THAT WE TURNED HER OUT OF THE HOUSE BUT I DON'T THINK SO IN SPITE OF ALL HER FAULTS SHE NEVER SEEMED DECEITFUL OR MALICIOUS MUMFORD WAS STRONGLY TEMPTED TO REVEAL WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE STATION
AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO HAD ALIGHTED HER EYE SOON PERCEIVED CLARENCE MUMFORD SHE STEPPED UP TO HIM AND DREW HIS ATTENTION OH HAVE YOU COME BY THE SAME TRAIN HE ASKED SHAKING HANDS WITH HER NO
ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOT A MAN TO TROUBLE HIMSELF ABOUT A SMALL OR GREAT GRIEVANCE AT ANY RATE THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE
WE WILL FIND HIM GOD WILL GIVE HIM BACK TO US BUT IN THE MEANTIME YOU ARE HUNGRY AND YOU MUST EAT SOMETHING SO SAYING HE OFFERED THE POOR NEGRO A FEW HANDFULS OF SHELL FISH WHICH WAS INDEED WRETCHED AND INSUFFICIENT FOOD
TO GET HER OUT OF THE HOUSE WAS THE MAIN POINT IF SHE CHOSE TO DEPART IN A WHIRLWIND THAT WAS HER OWN AFFAIR ALL BUT CERTAINLY SHE WOULD GO HOME TO MORROW IF NOT TO DAY IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HER STEP SOUNDED ON THE STAIRS
IT WAS WHOLLY AND ENTIRELY MY FAULT BY DUE INSISTENCE ON THIS MUMFORD OF COURSE PUT HIS WIFE INTO AN EXCELLENT HUMOUR AND AFTER THEY HAD DINED SHE RETURNED TO HER REGRET THAT THE GIRL SHOULD HAVE GONE SO SUDDENLY
LOUISE SUFFERED SO MUCH THAT SHE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SHADOW BEFORE HER WAS THE TOWERING UGLINESS OF THE GRAND STAND THIS SHE HAD SEEN AND ADMIRED WHEN DRIVING PAST IT WITH HER FRIENDS IT DID NOT NOW ATTRACT HER
SOFT OF HUE BENEATH THE SUMMER SKY SPREADING ITS TRANQUIL BEAUTY FAR AWAY TO THE MISTS OF THE HORIZON IN VIVACIOUS COMPANY SHE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT AND PERHAPS HAVE THOUGHT IT A CHARMING VIEW ALONE SHE HAD NO EYE FOR SUCH THINGS
WE SHALL CERTAINLY FIND SOME WAY OF MAKING A FIRE SAID HERBERT CAPTAIN HARDING OR MISTER SPILETT WILL NOT BE WITHOUT THEM YES REPLIED PENCROFT BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE WITHOUT FIRE
AND I OUGHT TO HAVE TOLD HER I SHOULD HAVE IF I HADN'T LOST MY TEMPER WELL REPLIED THE OTHER IN GRAVE EMBARRASSMENT BUT FEELING THAT HE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE LET US GO TO THE HOUSE OH I COULDN'T
WITH PERFECT NAIVETE OR WITH PERFECT SIMULATION OF IT SHE LOOKED HIM IN THE FACE AND IT WAS MUMFORD WHO HAD TO AVERT HIS EYES THE YOUNG MAN FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
YES IT'S A GOOD THING SHE HAS GONE BUT I WISH IT HADN'T HAPPENED IN THAT WAY WHAT A SPITFIRE SHE IS I NEVER NEVER SAW THE LIKE AND IF YOU HAD HEARD MISSUS HIGGINS OH WHAT DREADFUL PEOPLE
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET FROM THE CAVE THEY HUNTED THERE AMONG THE SHINGLE IN THE CLEFTS OF THE ROCKS BUT FOUND NOTHING IF THE BOX HAD FALLEN AT THIS PLACE IT MUST HAVE BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE WAVES AS THE SEA WENT DOWN
BETTER TO HAVE TWO STRINGS TO ONE'S BOW THAN NO STRING AT ALL OH EXCLAIMED HERBERT HOW JOLLY IT WILL BE IF THEY WERE TO FIND CAPTAIN HARDING AND WERE TO BRING HIM BACK WITH THEM YES INDEED SAID PENCROFT THAT WAS A MAN OF THE RIGHT SORT WAS EXCLAIMED HERBERT
CLARENCE DECLARING THAT HE WOULD ALLOW HIMSELF A CIGAR INSTEAD OF THE USUAL PIPE TO CELEBRATE THE RESTORATION OF DOMESTIC PEACE SOON LED EMMELINE INTO THE GARDEN HEAVENS HOW HOT IT HAS BEEN
CONFOUND IT EXCLAIMED THE SAILOR THE REPORTER HEARD HIM AND SEIZING HIS ARM HAVE YOU NO MATCHES HE ASKED NOT ONE AND NO FIRE IN CONSEQUENCE
FLUSHED WITH ANGER HER EYES GLARING SHE BROKE INTO VEHEMENT EXCLAMATIONS YOU WANT TO GET RID OF ME VERY WELL I'LL GO THIS MOMENT I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
STUNTED BITTERED AND TWISTED THROUGH MANY A WINTER BY THE UPLAND GALES LOUISE NOTICED THEM ONLY TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT UGLY TREES THEY WERE BEFORE HER EAST WEST AND NORTH LAY THE WOODED LANDSCAPE
THOUGH PIERCED WITH VEXATION HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO HOLD OUT A WELCOMING HAND HAVE YOU COME ALL THE WAY BACK FROM LONDON JUST TO SAY THIS I HAVEN'T BEEN TO LONDON I'VE WALKED ABOUT ALL DAY AND OH I'M SO TIRED AND MISERABLE
DOUBTLESS IT MIGHT BE PROCURED AT THE INN YONDER NEAR THE RACECOURSE AND THITHER SHE BEGAN TO MOVE HER THOUGHTS WERE MORE AT REST SHE HAD MADE HER PLAN FOR THE EVENING ALL THAT HAD TO BE DONE WAS TO KILL TIME FOR ANOTHER HOUR OR SO
SHE FLUNG OUT OF THE ROOM AND FLEW UPSTAIRS EMMELINE ANGERED BY THIS UNWARRANTABLE TREATMENT DETERMINED TO HOLD ALOOF AND LET THE GIRL DO AS SHE WOULD
BUT THEY MUST GIVE UP THE FEAST OF HARD EGGS WHICH THEY HAD MEANT TO PREPARE AND A MEAL OF RAW FLESH WAS NOT AN AGREEABLE PROSPECT EITHER FOR THEMSELVES OR FOR THE OTHERS BEFORE RETURNING TO THE CAVE THE SAILOR AND HERBERT IN THE EVENT OF FIRE BEING POSITIVELY UNATTAINABLE
WHICH WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HE WAS A CONFIRMED SMOKER HE COULD NOT FIND IT HE RUMMAGED THE POCKETS OF HIS TROUSERS BUT TO HIS HORROR HE COULD NOWHERE DISCOVER THE BOX HERE'S A GO SAID HE LOOKING AT HERBERT
LET'S RUN TO THE PLACE WHERE WE LANDED IT WAS SCARCELY PROBABLE THAT THEY WOULD FIND THE BOX WHICH THE WAVES HAD ROLLED ABOUT AMONG THE PEBBLES AT HIGH TIDE BUT IT WAS AS WELL TO TRY HERBERT AND PENCROFT WALKED RAPIDLY TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD LANDED THE DAY BEFORE
MISS DERRICK HAD GONE BACK INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND TO EMMELINE'S SURPRISE REMAINED THERE THIS RETIREMENT WAS OMINOUS THE GIRL MUST BE TAKING SOME RESOLVE EMMELINE ON HER PART BRACED HER COURAGE FOR THE STEP ON WHICH SHE HAD DECIDED
THIS IF THE SMOKE DID NOT TAKE THE HEAT OUT WITH IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN AN EQUAL TEMPERATURE INSIDE THEIR WOOD WAS STOWED AWAY IN ONE OF THE ROOMS AND THE SAILOR LAID IN THE FIREPLACE SOME LOGS AND BRUSHWOOD THE SEAMAN WAS BUSY WITH THIS WHEN HERBERT ASKED HIM IF HE HAD ANY MATCHES
LOUISE CAME FORWARD HER HEAD BENT HER FEATURES ELOQUENT OF FATIGUE AND DISTRESS MISSUS MUMFORD I COULDN'T WITHOUT ASKING YOU TO FORGIVE ME HER VOICE BROKE WITH A SOB SHE STOOD IN A HUMBLE ATTITUDE AND EMMELINE
AND THEN PERHAPS MISSUS MUMFORD SHE'S SO KIND WOULD SAY THAT SHE WAS SORRY TOO AND THEN I MIGHT COME INTO THE GARDEN AND FIND YOU BOTH SITTING THERE MUMFORD DESPITE HIS MOST UNEASY FRAME OF MIND BETRAYED A PASSING AMUSEMENT
PENCROFT THEN TWISTED THE PIECE OF PAPER INTO THE SHAPE OF A CONE AS SMOKERS DO IN A HIGH WIND AND POKED IT IN AMONG THE MOSS TAKING A SMALL ROUGH STONE HE WIPED IT CAREFULLY AND WITH A BEATING HEART HOLDING HIS BREATH
AND HIS BODY HAD NOT EVEN OBTAINED A BURIAL PLACE THUS PASSED THE TWENTY FIFTH OF MARCH NIGHT HAD COME ON OUTSIDE COULD BE HEARD THE HOWLING OF THE WIND AND THE MONOTONOUS SOUND OF THE SURF BREAKING ON THE SHORE
THE FIRST ATTEMPT DID NOT PRODUCE ANY EFFECT PENCROFT HAD NOT STRUCK HARD ENOUGH FEARING TO RUB OFF THE PHOSPHORUS NO I CAN'T DO IT SAID HE MY HAND TREMBLES THE MATCH HAS MISSED FIRE I CANNOT I WILL NOT
THE FLOOR WAS COVERED WITH FINE SAND AND TAKING ALL IN ALL THEY WERE WELL PLEASED WITH IT FOR WANT OF A BETTER PERHAPS SAID HERBERT WHILE HE AND PENCROFT WERE WORKING
MAKING A CHOKING SMOKE HERBERT QUICKLY TURNED THE MATCH SO AS TO AUGMENT THE FLAME AND THEN SLIPPED IT INTO THE PAPER CONE WHICH IN A FEW SECONDS TOO CAUGHT FIRE AND THEN THE MOSS
THE FLAT STONES MADE A CAPITAL FIREPLACE THE SMOKE WENT QUITE EASILY OUT AT THE NARROW PASSAGE THE CHIMNEY DREW AND AN AGREEABLE WARMTH WAS NOT LONG IN BEING FELT THEY MUST NOW TAKE GREAT CARE NOT TO LET THE FIRE GO OUT
DO YOU DESPAIR OF EVER SEEING HIM AGAIN GOD FORBID REPLIED THE SAILOR THEIR WORK WAS SOON DONE AND PENCROFT DECLARED HIMSELF VERY WELL SATISFIED NOW SAID HE OUR FRIENDS CAN COME BACK WHEN THEY LIKE THEY WILL FIND A GOOD ENOUGH SHELTER
THE EXPLORATION OF THE COAST THE INCIDENT OF THE MATCHES ET CETERA AND THEN OVERCOME BY FATIGUE HE MANAGED TO FORGET HIS SORROWS IN SLEEP HERBERT WENT TO SLEEP DIRECTLY AS TO THE SAILOR HE PASSED THE NIGHT WITH ONE EYE ON THE FIRE
AND WITH INWARD MURMURS MADE A REPAST WHICH REMINDED HER OF THE EXCELLENT LUNCHEON SHE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN ENJOYING ALL THE TIME SHE PONDERED HER SITUATION ULTIMATELY INSTEAD OF BOOKING FOR VICTORIA SHE PROCURED A TICKET FOR EPSOM DOWNS
ON THE WAY PENCROFT ASKED HIM IN THE MOST NATURAL TONE IF BY CHANCE HE HAPPENED TO HAVE A MATCH OR TWO THE REPORTER STOPPED FELT IN HIS POCKETS BUT FINDING NOTHING SAID I HAD SOME BUT I MUST HAVE THROWN THEM AWAY
THE FIRST THING SHE DID WAS TO HAVE A GOOD CRY THEN FOR AN HOUR SHE SAT THINKING AND AS SHE THOUGHT HER FACE GRADUALLY EMERGED FROM GLOOM THE BETTER TRUER FACE WHICH SO OFTEN ALLOWED ITSELF TO BE DISGUISED AT THE PROMPTING OF AN EVIL SPIRIT
AND ALWAYS TO KEEP SOME EMBERS ALIGHT IT ONLY NEEDED CARE AND ATTENTION
AND I FELT SO MISERABLE WHEN MISSUS MUMFORD SEEMED TO WANT TO GET RID OF ME I FEEL SURE SHE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO SEND ME AWAY SHE WAS ONLY ADVISING ME AS SHE THOUGHT FOR MY GOOD BUT I CAN'T AND WON'T GO HOME
AND CONSEQUENTLY MUCH BEYOND THE PLACE WHERE THE BALLOON HAD FALLEN THE LAST TIME BUT ONE A FALL WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE ENGINEER AND THE DOG TOP THE SHORE WAS SOLITARY NOT A VESTIGE OF A MARK NOT EVEN A PEBBLE RECENTLY DISPLACED
OH I'M QUITE SURE EMMY WILL BE GLAD TO LET YOU COME FOR THE NIGHT MISS DERRICK YES BUT MISTER MUMFORD I WANT TO STAY LONGER A FEW WEEKS LONGER DO YOU THINK MISSUS MUMFORD WOULD FORGIVE ME I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND WHAT TO DO
AND THE TEARS WHICH HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN TOLD TOO CLEARLY THAT HE HAD LOST ALL HOPE THE REPORTER RECOUNTED ALL THAT THEY HAD DONE IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO RECOVER CYRUS HARDING
DRAWERS WERE LEFT OPEN AS IF TO EXHIBIT THEIR EMPTINESS BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS THE ROOM LOOKED TIDY ENOUGH NEATNESS AND ORDER CAME BY NO MEANS NATURALLY TO MISS DERRICK AND EMMELINE DID NOT KNOW WHAT PAINS THE GIRL HAD TAKEN EVER SINCE HER ARRIVAL
AS A SCULLERY MAID I WANT TO ASK YOU MISSUS MUMFORD WHETHER YOU WILL LET ME STAY ON AND TRUST ME TO PAY WHAT I OWE YOU IT WON'T BE FOR VERY LONG AND I PROMISE YOU I WILL PAY EVERY PENNY
WALKING LIGHTLY OVER THE TURF SHE NOTICED THE CHALK MARKS SIGNIFICANT OF GOLF AND WONDERED HOW THE GAME WAS PLAYED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY SHE OBTAINED HER CUP OF TEA LOITERED OVER IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE STRAYED YET AWHILE ABOUT THE DOWNS
AND KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE FIREPLACE SOME HANDFULS OF GRASS LEAVES AND DRY MOSS WERE PLACED UNDER THE FAGOTS AND DISPOSED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE AIR COULD EASILY CIRCULATE AND THE DRY WOOD WOULD RAPIDLY CATCH FIRE
AND RISING HE TOLD HERBERT TO TAKE HIS PLACE CERTAINLY THE BOY HAD NEVER IN ALL HIS LIFE BEEN SO NERVOUS PROMETHEUS GOING TO STEAL THE FIRE FROM HEAVEN COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ANXIOUS HE DID NOT HESITATE HOWEVER BUT STRUCK THE MATCH DIRECTLY
THE SAILOR FIRST MADE SURE THAT IT WAS QUITE DRY THAT DONE WE MUST HAVE SOME PAPER SAID HE HERE REPLIED SPILETT AFTER SOME HESITATION TEARING A LEAF OUT OF HIS NOTE BOOK PENCROFT TOOK THE PIECE OF PAPER WHICH THE REPORTER HELD OUT TO HIM
I WILL ARRANGE IT COME ABOUT HALF PAST EIGHT WE SHALL BE IN THE GARDEN BY THEN AVOIDING HER LOOK HE MOVED AWAY AND RAN UP THE STAIRS BUT FROM THE EXIT OF THE STATION HE WALKED SLOWLY IN PART TO CALM HIMSELF
EXCLAIMING IN A VOICE WHICH SHOWED HOW HOPE STRUGGLED WITHIN HIM NO HE IS NOT DEAD HE CAN'T BE DEAD IT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ANY ONE ELSE BUT NEVER TO HIM HE COULD GET OUT OF ANYTHING
BUT A NOTICE BOARD SEVERELY ADMONISHING TRESPASSERS FORBADE THE ATTEMPT WITH A PETULANT REMARK TO HERSELF ON THE SELFISHNESS OF THOSE PEOPLE SHE SAUNTERED PAST ALONG THIS EDGE OF THE DOWNS STANDS A PICTURESQUE ROW OF PINE TREES
AND OUR COMPANIONS WILL FIND BUT A SORRY REPAST ON THEIR RETURN BUT SAID HERBERT QUICKLY DO YOU THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY HAVE NO TINDER OR MATCHES I DOUBT IT REPLIED THE SAILOR SHAKING HIS HEAD
LOUISE HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE EMMELINE APPROACHED HER HUSBAND THERE I FORESAW IT ISN'T VEXING NEVER MIND DEAR SHE'LL GO TO MORROW OR THE DAY AFTER
HER SOFTENING LIPS ALL BUT SMILED AS IF AT AN AMUSING SUGGESTION AND HER EYES IN THEIR REVERIE SEEMED TO BEHOLD A PLEASANT PROMISE UNCONSCIOUSLY SHE PLUCKED AND TASTED THE SWEET STEMS OF GRASS THAT GREW ABOUT HER AT LENGTH
AND THEN CAME BACK JUST IN TIME AND DO YOU THINK I MIGHT GO BACK I DON'T MEAN NOW AT ONCE BUT THIS EVENING AFTER YOU'VE HAD DINNER I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO FOR THE NIGHT AND IT'S SUCH A STUPID POSITION TO BE IN ISN'T IT
AND I BELIEVE THAT MISTER SPILETT WOULD RATHER KEEP HIS NOTE BOOK THAN HIS MATCH BOX HERBERT DID NOT REPLY THE LOSS OF THE BOX WAS CERTAINLY TO BE REGRETTED BUT THE BOY WAS STILL SURE OF PROCURING FIRE IN SOME WAY OR OTHER PENCROFT MORE EXPERIENCED DID NOT THINK SO
THE CAVE WAS THUS DIVIDED INTO THREE OR FOUR ROOMS IF SUCH DARK DENS WITH WHICH A DONKEY WOULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN CONTENTED DESERVED THE NAME BUT THEY WERE DRY AND THERE WAS SPACE TO STAND UPRIGHT AT LEAST IN THE PRINCIPAL ROOM WHICH OCCUPIED THE CENTER
HE FORGOT HIS PRIVATE EMBARRASSMENT IN SPECULATION AS TO THE YOUNG WOMAN'S CHARACTER THAT SHE WAS ACTING DISTRESS AND PENITENCE HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE INDEED THERE WAS NO NECESSITY TO ACCUSE HER OF DISHONEST BEHAVIOUR
A THREEFOLD THOUGHT WEIGHED ON HIS MIND WAS CYRUS STILL ALIVE IF HE WAS ALIVE WHERE WAS HE IF HE HAD SURVIVED FROM HIS FALL HOW WAS IT THAT HE HAD NOT FOUND SOME MEANS OF MAKING KNOWN HIS EXISTENCE
HE FEARED TO TELL THE SIMPLE TRUTH LEST EMMELINE SHOULD NOT BELIEVE HIS INNOCENCE OF PREVIOUS PLOTTING WITH MISS DERRICK OR AT ALL EVENTS SHOULD BE IRRITATED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO REFUSING LOUISE A LODGING FOR THE NIGHT
SIR SAID HE WE HAVE FOUND A SHELTER WHICH WILL BE BETTER THAN LYING HERE NIGHT IS ADVANCING COME AND REST TO MORROW WE WILL SEARCH FARTHER THE REPORTER GOT UP AND GUIDED BY THE BOY WENT TOWARDS THE CAVE
AND HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR THE TRAIN IT WAS A HOT DAY AT THE END OF JUNE WAFTS OF BREEZY COOLNESS PASSED NOW AND THEN OVER THE HIGH OPEN COUNTRY BUT DID NOT SUFFICE TO COMBAT THE SUN'S STEADY GLARE AFTER WALKING HALF A MILE OR SO ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
AND IN PART TO THINK OVER THE COMEDY HE WAS GOING TO PLAY EMMELINE MET HIM AT THE DOOR HERSELF TOO MUCH FLURRIED TO NOTICE ANYTHING PECULIAR IN HER HUSBAND'S ASPECT SHE REPEATED THE STORY WITH WHICH HE WAS ALREADY ACQUAINTED
IT WOULDN'T BE NICE WOULD IT I THOUGHT IF I CAME LATER AFTER DINNER AND PERHAPS YOU COULD TALK TO MISSUS MUMFORD AND AND PREPARE HER I MEAN
OH I CAN DO NO MORE HE MURMURED
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE ONE OF THAT KIND I'LL GO THIS MINUTE JUST AS YOU PLEASE SAID EMMELINE YOUR TEMPER IS REALLY SO VERY OH I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS MY TEMPER AND NOBODY ELSE IS EVER TO BLAME
IT WAS MY FAULT DEAR
I MUST SAY I PREFER MATCHES BY THE BYE WHERE ARE MY MATCHES
AND I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL THE AFTERNOON TO SEE YOU NO NOT HERE
THE WAVES ROLLED THE SHINGLE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH A DEAFENING NOISE THE REPORTER RETIRED INTO A DARK CORNER AFTER HAVING SHORTLY NOTED DOWN THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THIS NEW LAND THE LOSS OF THEIR LEADER
COLLECTED SOME MORE SHELL FISH AND THEN SILENTLY RETRACED THEIR STEPS TO THEIR DWELLING PENCROFT HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND STILL LOOKED FOR HIS BOX HE EVEN CLIMBED UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER FROM ITS MOUTH TO THE ANGLE WHERE THE RAFT HAD BEEN MOORED
THEY NOW HAD ONLY TO MAKE A FIREPLACE AND TO PREPARE THE SUPPER AN EASY TASK
ON WHICH HE DID NOT SPARE FUEL BUT ONE OF THE CASTAWAYS DID NOT SLEEP IN THE CAVE
AND THE SEAMAN INVITED THE REPORTER TO TAKE HIS SHARE OF THE SUPPER SUCH WAS THE FIRST REPAST OF THE CASTAWAYS ON THIS UNKNOWN COAST THE HARD EGGS WERE EXCELLENT AND AS EGGS CONTAIN EVERYTHING INDISPENSABLE TO MAN'S NOURISHMENT
I'LL SEND FOR MY LUGGAGE YOU SHAN'T BE TROUBLED WITH IT LONG
BUT NOTHING OF THAT KIND SHALL HAPPEN AGAIN HER COUNTENANCE WAS DISTURBED SHE SEEMED TO BE PUTTING A RESTRAINT UPON HERSELF AND ONLY WITH GREAT EFFORT TO SUBDUE HER VOICE
WOULD SHE TURN INTO THE DINING ROOM WHERE EMMELINE NOW SAT AT TABLE NO STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HALL AND OUT AT THE FRONT DOOR WHICH CLOSED HOWEVER QUITE SOFTLY BEHIND HER THAT SHE DID NOT SLAM IT SEEMED WONDERFUL TO EMMELINE
BEFORE THIS CLEAR CRACKLING FIRE ON THE DRY SAND WHAT THANKSGIVING MUST THEY HAVE RENDERED TO HEAVEN BUT THE MOST INGENIOUS THE MOST LEARNED HE WHO WAS THEIR UNQUESTIONED CHIEF CYRUS HARDING WAS ALAS MISSING
I KNEW BETTER THAN THAT REPLIED THE SAILOR BUT SUCH A SMALL ARTICLE COULD EASILY DISAPPEAR IN THE TUMBLING ABOUT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH I WOULD RATHER EVEN HAVE LOST MY PIPE CONFOUND THE BOX WHERE CAN IT BE LOOK HERE THE TIDE IS GOING DOWN SAID HERBERT
SHE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN HER PURPOSE IT SHAMED HER TO BEHAVE LIKE THE ORDINARY LANDLADY TO APPEAR ACTUATED BY MEAN MOTIVES BUT THE DOMESTIC STRAIN WAS GROWING INTOLERABLE
AN INDIFFERENCE CHARACTERISTIC OF HER MIND AND NOT AT ALL DEPENDENT UPON ITS MOOD PRESENTLY ANOTHER PATCH OF SHADE INVITED HER TO REPOSE AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE MEDITATED FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THE SUN HAD GROWN LESS ARDENT
AND TOWARDS HALF PAST SIX MADE FOR THE RAILWAY STATION SHE TRAVELLED NO FURTHER THAN SUTTON AND THERE LINGERED IN THE WAITING ROOM TILL THE ARRIVAL OF A CERTAIN TRAIN FROM LONDON BRIDGE AS THE TRAIN CAME IN SHE TOOK UP A POSITION NEAR THE EXIT
CERTAINLY REPLIED PENCROFT AND I MAY SAY HAPPILY FOR WITHOUT MATCHES OR TINDER WE SHOULD BE IN A FIX STILL WE MIGHT GET FIRE AS THE SAVAGES DO REPLIED HERBERT BY RUBBING TWO BITS OF DRY STICK ONE AGAINST THE OTHER
ON THE SAND AMONG THE ROCKS NEAR THE RIVER'S BANK THEY BOTH SEARCHED CAREFULLY BUT IN VAIN THE BOX WAS OF COPPER AND THEREFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN EASILY SEEN PENCROFT ASKED HERBERT DIDN'T YOU THROW IT OUT OF THE CAR
HE TOOK THE MATCH AND FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANIONS ENTERED THE CAVE THIS SMALL PIECE OF WOOD OF WHICH SO MANY IN AN INHABITED COUNTRY ARE WASTED WITH INDIFFERENCE AND ARE OF NO VALUE MUST HERE BE USED WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION
HERBERT TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM BY OBSERVING THAT IF THEY HAD FOUND THE MATCHES THEY WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE BEEN WETTED BY THE SEA AND USELESS NO MY BOY REPLIED THE SAILOR THEY WERE IN A COPPER BOX WHICH SHUT VERY TIGHTLY AND NOW WHAT ARE WE TO DO
TO LIVE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE HABITS OF A NICE HOUSEHOLD LOUISE MEANWHILE HAD GONE TO THE RAILWAY STATION INTENDING TO TAKE A TICKET FOR VICTORIA BUT HALF AN HOUR MUST ELAPSE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF A TRAIN
I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE YOU MISTER MUMFORD WILL YOU SPARE ME A MINUTE OR TWO HERE IN THE STATION PLEASE IF YOU DON'T MIND ASTONISHED MUMFORD DREW ASIDE WITH HER TO A QUIET PART OF THE LONG PLATFORM
THAT THE ENGINEER MUST HAVE FOUND A TOMB
THE TRIVIAL CONCEALMENT BETWEEN HIM AND HER AMOUNTED TO NOTHING DID NOT ALTER THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION BUT WHAT COULD BE AT THE ROOT OF HER SEEMINGLY SO FOOLISH EXISTENCE EMMELINE HELD TO THE VIEW THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE MAN COBB
TRY AGAIN A SINGLE MATCH WILL BE ENOUGH THE REPORTER HUNTED AGAIN IN THE POCKETS OF HIS TROUSERS WAISTCOAT AND GREAT COAT AND AT LAST TO PENCROFT'S GREAT JOY NO LESS TO HIS EXTREME SURPRISE HE FELT A TINY PIECE OF WOOD ENTANGLED IN THE LINING OF HIS WAISTCOAT
NOT A TRACE ON THE SAND NOT A HUMAN FOOTSTEP ON ALL THAT PART OF THE BEACH IT WAS CLEAR THAT THAT PORTION OF THE SHORE HAD NEVER BEEN VISITED BY A HUMAN BEING THE SEA WAS AS DESERTED AS THE LAND AND IT WAS THERE A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM THE COAST
A MINUTE LATER THE DRY WOOD CRACKLED AND A CHEERFUL FLAME ASSISTED BY THE VIGOROUS BLOWING OF THE SAILOR SPRANG UP IN THE MIDST OF THE DARKNESS AT LAST CRIED PENCROFT GETTING UP I WAS NEVER SO NERVOUS BEFORE IN ALL MY LIFE
HE WAS ROAMING ABOUT THE SHORE HE WAS LIKE A BODY WITHOUT A SOUL PENCROFT KNEW FIFTY WAYS OF COOKING EGGS BUT THIS TIME HE HAD NO CHOICE AND WAS OBLIGED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH ROASTING THEM UNDER THE HOT CINDERS IN A FEW MINUTES THE COOKING WAS DONE
WILL YOU LET ME STAY JUST FOR TO NIGHT I SHALL BE SO GRATEFUL OF COURSE YOU MAY STAY MISS DERRICK IT WAS VERY FAR FROM MY WISH TO SEE YOU GO OFF AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE BUT I REALLY COULDN'T STOP YOU MUMFORD HAD STEPPED ASIDE OUT OF HEARING
AND A BREEZE NO LONGER FITFUL MADE WALKING PLEASANT THE SIGHT OF HOLIDAY MAKING SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO IN THEIR RIBBONED HATS AND WHITE PINAFORES WERE HAVING TEA NOT FAR AWAY SUGGESTED TO LOUISE THAT SHE ALSO WOULD LIKE SUCH REFRESHMENT
HE LOOKED INTO THE GIRL'S FACE AND SAW ITS PRETTINESS FLUSH WITH PRETTY CONFUSION AND THIS DID NOT TEND TO RESTORE HIS TRANQUILLITY WHAT SHALL YOU DO IN THE MEANTIME
YOU DON'T REALLY MIND THAT WE LOSE THE MONEY EMMELINE ASKED PRESENTLY POOH WE SHALL DO WELL ENOUGH WHO'S THAT SOMEONE WAS ENTERING THE GARDEN BY THE SIDE PATH AND IN A MOMENT THERE REMAINED NO DOUBT WHO THE PERSON WAS
THEY SEARCHED EVERY LITTLE CREVICE WITH NO RESULT IT WAS A GRAVE LOSS IN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND FOR THE TIME IRREPARABLE PENCROFT COULD NOT HIDE HIS VEXATION HE LOOKED VERY ANXIOUS BUT SAID NOT A WORD
HE MANAGED TO DRAW OUT THE WRETCHED YET PRECIOUS LITTLE BIT OF WOOD WHICH WAS OF SUCH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THESE POOR MEN IT WAS UNUSED HURRAH CRIED PENCROFT IT IS AS GOOD AS HAVING A WHOLE CARGO
THE GIRL WAS NOT WHOLLY A SAVAGE PRESENTLY MISSUS MUMFORD WENT UP TO INSPECT THE FORSAKEN CHAMBER LOUISE HAD PACKED ALL HER THINGS
EXHAUSTED WITH FATIGUE DYING OF HUNGER HE HAD NOT STRENGTH TO UTTER A WORD
EIGHTY FIVE IN OUR OFFICE AT NOON EIGHTY FIVE FELLOWS ARE DISCARDING WAISTCOATS AND WEARING WHAT THEY CALL A CUMMERBUND SILK SASH ROUND THE WAIST I THINK I MUST FOLLOW THE FASHION HOW SHOULD I LOOK DO YOU THINK
AND IF YOU PLEASE I WILL SHOW YOU THAT PART OF THE GLOBE OR EARTH IN WHICH THOSE EFFECTS BEGIN TO TAKE PLACE BUT MY DEAR ELLEN PRAY LEND MATILDA YOUR TIPPET FOR SHE LOOKS AS MUCH FROZEN AS THE SNOW SHE MUST TAKE GREAT CARE OF HERSELF IN THIS COLD CLIMATE
AND THEN I SHALL NOT BE AN OBJECT OF PITY SIR NO YOU WILL BE ONE OF AFFECTION AND ESTEEM OH I DOUBT THAT MUST NEVER NEVER BE
MISS LINTON HE SAYS SPEAKING FIRST I'VE JUST DROPPED IN TO ASK IF THE YOUNG LADIES WOULD GO FOR A RIDE THE DAY'S SO FINE I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT LIKE TO
IT WILL NOT ONLY INCREASE HER PLEASURE BUT ENABLE HER TO PREPARE HER APARTMENT FOR SUCH A NOBLE AND USEFUL PIECE OF FURNITURE MATILDA LEFT THE ROOM BUT RETURNED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
THOUGH NOT ALWAYS THE CHASTEST OF THE PRURIENT TRASH THERE IS A PLENTEOUS SUPPLY FURNISHED BY SCRIBBLERS OF BOTH SEXES WHO OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER AND DOUBTLESS DO
ELLEN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH THIS PROOF OF GOOD DISPOSITION IN MATILDA AND WITH THE HONEST EFFUSIONS OF THE POOR NEGRO THAT SHE COULD NOT FORBEAR GRATIFYING HER OWN AFFECTIONATE LITTLE HEART BY RUNNING TO TELL HER DEAR MAMMA
YOU ARE MORTIFIED AT STOPPING SHORT OF YOUR OWN WISHES AND THEIR WANTS OH DEAR MA'AM REPLIED MATILDA YOU HAVE READ ALL THE THOUGHTS OF MY HEART AT LEAST ALL BUT ONE
PRAY STEP DOWN STAIRS AND TELL BETTY TO BRING UP THE LITTLE INNOCENTS WE SHALL ALL BE GLAD TO SEE THEM CHARLES FLEW OUT OF THE ROOM AND IN LESS THAN A MINUTE RETURNED WITH THE MOTHER CARRYING A BABE IN EACH ARM
IT IS THUS WITH LLANGORREN WHOSE OSTENSIBLE MISTRESS IS MISS LINTON THE AUNT AND LEGAL GUARDIAN ALREADY ALLUDED TO BUT THOUGH PRESIDING OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT IT IS RATHER IN THE WAY OF ORNAMENTAL FIGURE HEAD SINCE SHE TAKES LITTLE TO DO WITH ITS DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
I WISH YOU CHILDREN TO BE FREE AND LIBERAL FOR WE ARE TOLD IN THE SCRIPTURES THAT GOD LOVETH A CHEERFUL GIVER BUT IN ORDER TO RENDER YOU ALSO FREQUENT GIVERS YOU MUST BE PRUDENT ONES I HAVE ONLY ONE SHILLING IN THE WORLD SAID ELLEN LAYING IT ON THE TABLE
HE APPREHENDED THAT THE COLD WHICH HE FELT HIMSELF TO BE SEVERE HAD MADE HER ILL AND HE INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HER IN A TONE OF REAL COMMISERATION I AM SO SO VERY IGNORANT SAID MATILDA SOBBING
ANGER NOR ANY OTHER EMOTION EXCEPT JOY AT SEEING THE LITTLE OBJECTS OF THEIR CARE BENEFITED AND YOU HAPPY FOR THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT ONLY TO VALUE SUCH ACTIONS ACCORDING TO THE MOTIVE IN ONE PARTY AND THEIR USEFULNESS TO THE OTHER BUT MATILDA
AND THEN CHARLES WHO IS SO FULL OF FUN AND NONSENSE AND WHO I ALWAYS THOUGHT COULD NOT ABIDE ME HE SPOKE TO ME AS IF HE WAS SORRY FOR ME AND MADE IT OUT THAT WE WERE BOTH IGNORANT ALIKE AND WHEN I REMEMBERED HOW I HAD LOOKED AT THEM AND BEHAVED TO THEM
AND MANY CURIOUS FISH ON YOUR VOYAGE
AND IF AT ANY TIME YOU ARE DISCOMFITED IN ANY PURSUIT EITHER OF VIRTUE OR KNOWLEDGE RECOLLECT WHAT I NOW SAY THAT WITH MANY FAULTS YET YOU HAVE SOME MERIT AND MAY THEREFORE REASONABLY HOPE TO ATTAIN MORE
HE GAVE HIS FULL ASSENT AND PRODUCED THE MONEY NECESSARY FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE MANGLE
MISSUS HAREWOOD COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT CHARLES'S EAGERNESS AS SHE REMEMBERED THE USEFUL MORTIFICATION HE HAD EXPERIENCED THE LAST TIME HIS CHARITY WAS CALLED UPON AND AS SHE TOOK UP THE MONEY SHE OBSERVED TO HIM
WHEN SALLY AND ZEBBY RUSHED INTO THE ROOM TOGETHER FOLLOWED BY BETTY WHO WAS TRULY GRATEFUL FOR THE KINDNESS THUS BESTOWED ON HER SISTER SALLY WITH TEARS OF JOY THANKED HER YOUNG BENEFACTRESS
WHO TRULY REJOICED IN EVERY PROOF OF MATILDA'S AMENDMENT AND DOUBTED NOT BUT IT WOULD PROVE THE FORERUNNER OF VIRTUE IN A CHILD WHO APPEARED CONVINCED OF HER FAULTS AND DESIROUS OF IMPROVING HERSELF
AT NEARLY ALL HOURS OF THE DAY AND SOME OF THE NIGHT DOES SHE SO OCCUPY HERSELF EVEN ON THIS SAME BRIGHT APRIL MORN WHEN ALL NATURE REJOICES AND EVERY LIVING THING SEEMS TO DELIGHT IN BEING OUT OF DOORS
MISS LINTON NEED HAVE NO FEAR THAT THE IMPURE STREAM WILL CEASE TO FLOW ANY MORE THAN THE LIMPID WATERS OF THE WYE NOR HAS SHE BUT READS ON DEVOURING VOLUME AFTER VOLUME IN TRIUNES AS THEY ISSUE FROM THE PRESS AND ARE SENT HER FROM THE CIRCULATING LIBRARY
WHEN I THOUGHT ON THESE THINGS I CAME CLOSE UP TO YOU BUT MY HEART BEAT SO QUICK I COULD NOT SPEAK OR ELSE I HAD A GUINEA IN MY HAND THE LAST MY DEAR MAMMA GAVE ME AND I WISHED VERY MUCH TO GIVE YOU THAT
WHEN THEY WERE GONE AND THE LITTLE GIRL HAD SOMEWHAT RECOVERED MISTER HAREWOOD WHISPERED HER DID YOU MEAN TO SAY MY DEAR THAT MY CHILDREN WERE SO CLEVER OR SO PROUD OR SO WHAT OH SIR THEY ARE SO GOOD
BUT MISS LINTON THEY MAY HAVE RETURNED FROM THE RIVER AND ARE NOW SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE GROUNDS SHALL I RUN DOWN TO THE BOAT DOCK AND SEE IT IS MISTER SHENSTONE WHO THUS INTERROGATES IF YOU LIKE BY ALL MEANS I SHALL BE TOO THANKFUL
DON'T YOU BE STAYING TOO ELSE YOU SHAN'T HAVE A PICK MISTER MUSGRAVE AND I WON'T WAIT FOR ANY OF YOU SHALL WE MISTER MUSGRAVE SHENSTONE HAS NOT TARRIED TO HEAR EITHER QUESTION OR ANSWER A LUNCHEON FOR APICIUS WERE AT THAT MOMENT NOTHING TO HIM AND LITTLE MORE TO THE CURATE WHO THOUGH STAYING
WHO IS HABITUALLY A DWELLER IN CITIES INSTEAD THE FORMER IS A FRANK MANLY FELLOW DEVOTED TO FIELD SPORTS AND RURAL PASTIMES A LITTLE BRUSQUE IN MANNER BUT FOR ALL WELL BRED AND WHAT IS EVEN BETTER WELL BEHAVED
MAMMA SAYS IT IS ONLY WILFUL IGNORANCE THAT IS BLAMEABLE MATILDA WEPT STILL MORE WHILE THE CHILDREN THUS TRIED TO COMFORT HER THIS DISTRESSED THEM ALL BUT THEY REJOICED TO SEE THEIR PARENTS ENTER THE ROOM PERSUADED THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO COMFORT HER BETTER
AND IF YOU THINK IT RIGHT AND ELLEN WILL NOT THINK ME PROUD I WILL INDEED BE VERY GLAD IF YOU WILL ACCEPT A CROWN FOR MY SUBSCRIPTION I SHALL RECEIVE IT WITH PLEASURE AND I CAN VENTURE TO ASSURE YOU THAT MY CHILDREN WILL NEITHER FEEL ENVY
IS IT POSSIBLE SHE EXCLAIMS LOOKING AT THE ORMOLU DIAL ON THE MANTELSHELF TEN MINUTES TO ONE HOW TIME DOES FLY TO BE SURE I COULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED IT NEAR SO LATE ALMOST LUNCHEON TIME OF COURSE YOU'LL STAY GENTLEMEN
BUT PERFECTLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE SELF DISTRUST AND TRUE HUMILITY WHICH WAS NOW HAPPILY TAKING A DEEP ROOT IN HER YOUNG MIND MISSUS HAREWOOD WAS GRATIFIED IN PERCEIVING SUCH RESULTS OF HER MATERNAL CARE FOR MATILDA
SAID ANYTHING ABOUT RIDING TO DAY NOT A WORD AT LEAST NOT TO ME HOW LONG SINCE THEY WENT OFF MAY I KNOW MISS LINTON OH HOURS AGO VERY EARLY INDEED
WHO NEITHER RIDES NOR HAS A HORSE AND LESS SHENSTONE HIMSELF INDEED BOTH AS THE LADY PROCEEDS THEY HAVE BEEN LISTENING WITH EARS ALL ALERT FOR THE SOUND OF SOFT FOOTSTEPS AND RUSTLING DRESSES INSTEAD THEY HEAR WORDS
NOBODY KNOWS HOW DEARLY I LOVE HER AND YOU TOO
IF YOU TAKE THIS PRETTY LIGHT SUBSTANCE INTO YOUR WARM HAND IT WILL MELT AND BECOME A RAIN DROP AGAIN AS EDMUND SPOKE HE OPENED THE WINDOW A VERY LITTLE WAY CAUGHT SOME SNOW AND SHOWED HER THE EFFECT HE SPOKE OF
YOU ARE AS GOOD AS ELLEN NOW MATILDA INDEED YOU ARE MISSUS HAREWOOD TENDERLY KISSING HER ASSURED HER OF HER APPROBATION SAYING
THANK YOU THANK YOU DEAR MISSUS HAREWOOD OH YOU ARE MY ENGLISH MOTHER AND I LOVE YOU MUCH MORE THAN ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE WORLD EXCEPT MY BARBADOES MAMMA THE CHILDREN EAGERLY CROWDED ROUND THEIR MOTHER'S CHAIR TO HEAR WHAT THE GOOD NEWS WAS
LEAVING THEM TO A SKILLED HOUSEKEEPER WHO CARRIES THE KEYS KITCHEN MATTERS ARE NOT MUCH TO MISS LINTON'S TASTE BEING A DAME OF THE ANTIQUE BROCADED TYPE WITH PLEASANT MEMORIES OF THE PAST THAT GO BACK TO BATH AND CHELTENHAM WHERE IN THEIR DAYS OF GLORY AS HERS OF YOUTH
AND WHEN YOU ARE INCLINED TO BE ANGRY WITH THOSE AROUND YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU HAVE THIS DAY CONFESSED RESPECTING THEIR KINDNESS AND IT WILL MAKE YOU BEAR WITH THE PRESENT VEXATION
WHEN MATILDA FIRST BEHELD HER SHE HAD A GREAT INCLINATION TO EMBRACE HER FOR HER HEART BOUNDED TOWARDS THE ONLY CREATURE SHE HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH FROM HER CRADLE BUT SHE SUDDENLY CHECKED HERSELF AND PRETENDED TO CONTINUE HER READING
THERE IS NOTHING ODD IN HIS CALLING AT THAT EARLY HOUR SIR GEORGE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF THE WYNN FAMILY WAS AN INTIMATE ASSOCIATE OF GWEN'S DECEASED FATHER AND BOTH HE AND HIS SON HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK IN AT LLANGORREN COURT SANS CEREMONIE
A FOOTMAN PRESENTS HIMSELF SILVER WAITER IN HAND ON WHICH IS A CARD SHE IS MORE THAN ANNOYED ALMOST ANGRY AS TAKING THE CARD SHE READS REVEREND WILLIAM MUSGRAVE
BUT SAID MATILDA WITH A MIXTURE OF EAGERNESS AND HESITATION THEN THERE WILL BE NO CHANGE FOR ME AND I WISH TO GIVE THE SAME AS ELLEN DON'T I WANT CHANGE MA'AM I I BELIEVE I DO
WHEN THE FLOWERS EXPAND THEIR PETALS TO CATCH THE KISSES OF THE WARM SPRING SUN DOROTHEA LINTON IS SEATED IN A SHADY CORNER OF THE DRAWING ROOM UP TO HER EARS IN A THREE VOLUME NOVEL STILL ODOROUS OF PRINTER'S INK AND BINDER'S PASTE
AH INDEED RETURNS THE SPINSTER HOLDING OUT HER FINGERS TO BE TOUCHED BUT UNDER THE PLEA OF BEING A LITTLE INVALIDED EXCUSING HERSELF FROM RISING YES NO DOUBT THEY WOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH
EAGERLY CRIED OUT IN GREAT SURPRISE ELLEN ELLEN GET UP THIS MOMENT AND COME TO THE WINDOW THE WHOLE WORLD IS COVERED WITH WHITE
NO MORE IS MISTER MUSGRAVE'S MATUTINAL VISIT OUT OF ORDER THOUGH BUT THE CURATE HE IS IN FULL CHARGE OF PARISH DUTIES THE RECTOR BEING NOT ONLY AGED BUT AN ABSENTEE SO LONG AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AS TO HAVE BECOME ALMOST A MYTH TO IT
YES EDMUND I DO KNOW THAT YOU WILL DO ANY THING IN YOUR POWER FOR YOU ARE REGULAR AND PRUDENT AS WELL AS A KIND HEARTED BOY AND THEREFORE HAVE ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO SPARE FOR THE WANTS OF OTHERS I PERCEIVE TOO
WHICH ENABLES YOUR FRIENDS TO SEE WHAT IS THE REAL BENT OF YOUR DISPOSITION AND TO GIVE YOU THE ADVICE REALLY NECESSARY AND I HOPE WITH THIS GROUNDWORK OF GOOD YOU WILL BE A VERY DIFFERENT GIRL WHEN YOUR MOTHER AGAIN SEES YOU
SHE GIVEE ME TEA GRUEL OUT OF HER OWN CUP YOU CALLEE ME BLACK BEETLE SHE CALLEE ME GOOD GIRLY GOOD NURSY GOOD EVERY TING MATILDA GAVE A DEEP SIGH
BUT WHY DID I NEVER SEE THIS IN BARBADOES BECAUSE BARBADOES LIES NEARER TO THE SUN THAN ENGLAND AND IS MUCH WARMER EVEN IN WINTER THEREFORE THE RAIN DROPS NEVER PASS THROUGH THAT REGION OF COLD AIR WHICH FREEZES THEM IN NORTHERN CLIMATES
NEVER DESPAIR THOUGH YOU HAVE MANY BATTLES WITH YOURSELF YET NEVER RELINQUISH THE HOPE OF FINAL CONQUEST AND BE ASSURED YOU WILL FIND EVERY VICTORY EASIER THAN THE LAST WHEN YOU FIND PRIDE RISING IN YOUR HEART THINK ON YOUR IGNORANCE AND IT WILL MAKE YOU HUMBLE
AND THE CHILDREN UNDERSTANDING THEIR MAMMA'S LOOK WITHDREW TO THE ROOM WHERE THEY USUALLY BREAKFASTED WITHOUT THE LEAST SYMPTOM OF DISCONTENT ALTHOUGH THEY PERCEIVED THEIR MAMMA FILL A CUP OF TEA FOR MATILDA AT HER OWN TABLE
BOTH TOWARDS GOD AND MAN AND THAT YOU HAVE THE MOST SINCERE DESIRE TO CONQUER THOSE FAULTS WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY GREATLY AMENDED THEREFORE I AM DETERMINED TO PERMIT YOU TO EXERCISE YOUR BENEVOLENCE IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE MANNER THAT YOUR HEART COULD WISH
ONE DAY WHEN EDMUND AND CHARLES HAD BEEN AT HOME ABOUT A WEEK THE LATTER RAN EAGERLY INTO THE SITTING PARLOUR CRYING OUT OH MAMMA THERE IS BETTY'S SISTER DOWN STAIRS WITH THE POOR LITTLE TWINS IN HER ARMS WHICH WERE BORN JUST WHEN MATILDA CAME
DO PRAY TELL ME SHE CRIED WHAT SNOW IS AND WHY I NEVER SAW IT BEFORE SNOW SAID EDMUND IS NOTHING BUT DROPS OF RAIN WHICH IN PASSING THROUGH THE COLD AIR BECOME CONGEALED OR FROZEN
BUT KNOWING ALSO HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO MAKE THEIR LUCUBRATIONS INTERESTING WITHIN THE LEGITIMATE LINES OF LITERARY ART AND HOW EASY OUT OF THEM THUS TRANSGRESS THE MORALITIES
BUT THE BAD TEMPER AND INSOLENT AIRS OF MATILDA HAD PREVENTED THIS AS MISSUS HAREWOOD COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA OF SUBJECTING AN AMIABLE YOUNG PERSON WHOM SHE DESIGNED FOR THAT SITUATION TO BE TORMENTED WITH SUCH A GIRL
AS FOR THE GIRLS IF THEY'RE NOT BACK IN TIME THEY'LL HAVE TO GO WITHOUT
WITH A FULLER HEBDOMADAL FEAST FROM THE COURT JOURNAL AND OTHER DISTRIBUTORS OF FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE IN ADDITION SHE READS NO END OF NOVELS HER FAVOURITES BEING THOSE WHICH TELL OF CUPID IN HIS MOST ROMANTIC ESCAPADES AND EXPERIENCES
SO WHAT MY DEAR SAID MISTER HAREWOOD DRAWING HER TOWARDS HIM AND PLACING HER BY HIS SIDE IN THE SAME MANNER HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO LET ELLEN STAND WHEN SHE WAS MUCH IN HIS FAVOUR THE ACTION HOWEVER KINDLY MEANT FOR A TIME REDOUBLED HER TEARS
GREAT GOD LOVEE MY DEAR MISSY NOW MATILDA FELT THE TEARS SUFFUSE HER OWN EYES AS THE KIND HEART OF HER LATE FAITHFUL SLAVE THUS GAVE VENT TO ITS NATURAL AND DEVOUT EMOTIONS AND SHE GAVE HER HAND TO ZEBBY WHO KISSED IT TWENTY TIMES
SHAME OF GWEN TO GIVE US SO MUCH TROUBLE SHE KNOWS OUR LUNCHEON HOUR AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK BY THIS THANKS MUCH MISTER SHENSTONE AS HE IS BOUNDING OFF SHE CALLS AFTER
IS IT LIKELY THEY WILL MISS LINTON I SHOULD SAY NOT
OH TANKEE GOD TANKEE GOD PRETTY MISSY BE GOOD GIRLY AT LAST HER LOVEE HER GOOD MAMMA HER PITY POOR NEGRO HER GO UP STAIR WHEN HER DIE OH ME BE SO GLAD
I WAS ONLY WONDERING WHY MISS GWEN THAT IS I AM A LITTLE ASTONISHED BUT PERHAPS YOU'LL THINK IT IMPERTINENT OF ME TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION WHY SHOULD I WHAT IS IT ONLY WHETHER WHETHER SHE MISS GWEN I MEAN
ONLY TO THINK OF BEING THUS INTERRUPTED ON THE EVE OF SUCH AN INTERESTING CLIMAX WHICH SEEMED ABOUT TO SEAL THE FATE OF THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER IT IS FORTUNATE FOR HIS REVERENCE THAT BEFORE ENTERING WITHIN THE ROOM ANOTHER VISITOR IS ANNOUNCED AND USHERED IN ALONG WITH HIM
FOR LUTESTRING IS NOT QUITE OUT OF HER THOUGHTS THERE'S NO KNOWING HOWEVER MISS WYNN IS ACCUSTOMED TO COME AND GO WITHOUT MUCH CONSULTING ME THIS WITH SOME ACERBITY
BECAUSE YOU KNOW LITTLE BOYS SELDOM LOVE LITTLE BABIES SO MUCH AS GIRLS DO MATILDA ANSWERED YES MECHANICALLY FOR HER MIND WAS ABSTRACTED AND AFFECTED BY THE REMEMBRANCE THIS SCENE WAS CALCULATED TO INSPIRE
ME VERY GLAD SEE YOU LARN BOOKY BUT ME HOPES YOU SPARE ONE LOOK ONE WORDY FOR POOR ZEBBY ME GO AWAY ONE LONG WEEKY TO NURSE WHITE MAN BABY PRETTY AS YOU MISSY YES SAID MATILDA REPROACHINGLY
AND SURELY SHE HAS A RIGHT TO RECEIVE EVERY GOOD I CAN BESTOW AS A SLIGHT ATONEMENT FOR THE PAIN I HAVE SO VERY FREQUENTLY GIVEN HER SCARCELY HAD MATILDA GIVEN THIS PROOF OF CONSIDERATION AND AMIABLE FEELING
I FIND WHAT YOUR MAMMA SAID WAS VERY TRUE I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL DEAR MATILDA HOW CAN YOU SAY SO SAID EDMUND THOUGH YOU HAVE NOT READ AS MUCH AS WE HAVE YET YOU HAVE SEEN A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN ANY OF US
BUT THEN THE MEMORY OF MY FOOLISH PRIDE THE LAST TIME CAME AGAIN INTO MY MIND I BECAME ASHAMED AND DETERMINED IN ALL THINGS TO BE GUIDED BY ELLEN WHO IS ALMOST A YEAR OLDER THAN I AND A GREAT DEAL BETTER
AND NOT A LITTLE PROUD OF THOSE VIRTUES WHICH SHE FANCIED SHE HAD ASSISTED TO NURTURE OH CRIED SHE DIS BE MY OWN BEAUTIFUL MISSY OWN GOODNESS
NOT ONLY DISAPPOINTING BUT PERPLEXING NAY I AM SURE CONTINUES MISS LINTON WITH PROVOKING COOLNESS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO GO RIDING WITH YOU DELIGHTED BUT WHY CAN'T THEY ASKED SHENSTONE IMPATIENTLY INTERRUPTING
YOU KNOW THE INSIDE OF A SHIP AS WELL AS A HOUSE AND WE NEVER SAW ANY THING BETTER THAN A SLOOP OR SAILED ANY WHERE BUT ON THE THAMES
WHERE EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE I MAY LEARN SOMETHING GOOD AND WHERE I HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL MORE HAPPY THAN EVER I WAS BEFORE EVEN IN THE HOUSE WITH MY OWN PARENTS MATILDA STOPPED A MOMENT AS IF SHE THOUGHT HER CONFESSION HAD PERHAPS INFRINGED ON HER DUTY
FOR IT SO CHANCES THAT THE SON OF SIR GEORGE SHENSTONE IS A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD LADY OF LLANGORREN WELCOME AT ALL TIMES EVEN AMID THE ROMANTIC GALLANTRIES OF LORD LUTESTRING NOT THAT THE YOUNG COUNTRY GENTLEMAN HAS ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH THE TITLED LOTHARIO
HER WORDS WERE FEW BUT THEY WERE THOSE OF RESPECT AND THANKFULNESS AND SHOWED SHE WAS DEEPLY SENSIBLE OF THE BENEFIT SHE EXPERIENCED POOR ZEBBY DELIGHTED WITH THE GOODNESS OF HER YOUNG MISTRESS AUDIBLY EXPRESSED HER PLEASURE WITH ALL THE CHARACTERISTIC WARMTH OF HER COUNTRY
AS WHICH SHOULD HAVE PRECEDENCE TO THIS NICE IF NOT VERY DELICATE APPRECIATION THE REVEREND WILLIAM IS NOW INDEBTED MORE THAN HE IS AWARE IT HAS SAVED HIM FROM AN OUTBURST OF MISS LINTON'S RATHER TART TEMPER WHICH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT
I FELT AS IF MY HEART WOULD BREAK ELLEN IS ALWAYS SO GOOD THAT I DID NOT THINK SO MUCH OF HER KINDNESS BUT NOBODY KNOWS AGAIN THE REPENTANT GIRL WEPT AND AT LENGTH WITH DIFFICULTY PROCEEDED
I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT SHE SAID AND HOW SHE LOOKED WHEN YOU TOLD HER THE GOOD NEWS I DID NOT SPEAK TO HER MYSELF I COMMISSIONED ZEBBY TO DO IT FOR I KNEW IT WOULD GIVE HER QUITE AS MUCH PLEASURE AS THE POOR WOMAN HERSELF COULD RECEIVE
AND ELLEN INSTANTLY BESOUGHT THEIR ATTENTION TO THE SUBJECT BY RELATING AS MUCH OF THE FOREGOING CONVERSATION AS WAS NECESSARY
WOULD GLADLY GO ALONG NOT FROM ANY RIVALRY WITH OR JEALOUSY OF THE BARONET'S SON THEY REVOLVE IN DIFFERENT ORBITS WITH NO DANGER OF COLLISION SIMPLY THAT HE DISLIKES LEAVING MISS LINTON ALONE
I REMEMBERED TOO HOW MISERABLE I WAS AND ALTOGETHER HOW MUCH I HAD TO LAMENT
IT WAS MY INTENTION TO PURCHASE ONE FOR HER MYSELF AT CHRISTMAS BUT I COULD NOT DO IT BEFORE AS MY CHARITY PURSE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH RUN UPON LATELY
WHICH PROMISED TO BENEFIT SALLY AND MAKE MATILDA HAPPY I KNOW SAID MISSUS HAREWOOD THAT THE PURCHASE OF A MANGLE WOULD SET UP THE POOR WOMAN IN HER PROFESSION AS A WASHERWOMAN AND ENABLE HER TO EARN AT LEAST TEN SHILLINGS A WEEK MORE
SHE WELL REMEMBERED THAT IT WAS ON THE VERY DAY OF HER OUTRAGE THAT ZEBBY HAD QUITTED HER AND IN HER ALTERED SENSE OF JUSTICE SHE COULD NOT HELP SEEING THE TRUTH OF THE POOR NEGRO'S STATEMENT SHE LOOKED UP WITH AN INGENUOUS SENSE OF ERROR DEPICTED ON HER COUNTENANCE AND SAID
YOU HAVE NOT AFFECTED ANY DISPLAY OF HUMANITY OR OSTENTATIOUS EXHIBITION OF WEALTH IN ORDER TO HUMBLE YOUR YOUNG FRIENDS BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR HEART IS NOT SATISFIED THAT HEART IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THESE BABES AND CONSCIOUS THAT IT IS IN YOUR POWER TO DO MORE
I THINK YOUR PROPOSAL IS A VERY GOOD ONE
IT IS SUFFICIENT WHILE THIS WAS PASSING MATILDA HAD BEEN FUMBLING IN HER POCKET AND BLUSHING EXCESSIVELY HER MIND WAS FULL OF PAINFUL RECOLLECTIONS YET FRAUGHT WITH GLEAMS OF SATISFACTION
BUT ELLEN SPOKE TO HER KINDLY THOUGH SHE TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS SO SITUATED AS NOT TO BE ABLE TO CHAT AT PRESENT ZEBBY COMPREHENDED THIS AND WOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN
AND YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST OF THE COMPANY YOU KNOW CONSIDER YOU HAVE CROSSED THE ATLANTIC OCEAN SEEN GROVES OF ORANGE TREES AND SPICES GROW AND THE WHOLE PROCESS OF SUGAR MAKING
I AM SORRY ZEBBY THAT I USED YOU SO ILL BUT I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN THE POOR AFRICAN WAS ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHED FOR NEVER HAD THE VOICE OF CONCESSION BEEN HEARD FROM THE LIPS OF MATILDA BEFORE EVEN TO HER OWN PARENTS
WHICH SHE EVIDENTLY RECEIVED WITH PAIN BUT AN EFFORT TO SMILE AS ELLEN HAD DONE IN RETURN FOR THE SMILE OF HER MAMMA AFTER A SHORT PAUSE MISSUS HAREWOOD SAID WELL MATILDA YOUR DELICACY IS NOW SATISFIED
IF HE FAIL IT WILL NOT BE FOR WANT OF WILL ON HIS PART NOR DESIRE OF THE AUTHOR TO SAVE THE IMPERILLED ONE HE WILL MAKE THE TEMPTED INIQUITOUS AS THE TEMPTER SHOULD THIS SEEM TO ADD INTEREST TO THE TALE OR PROMOTE THE SALE OF THE BOOK
SHE RECEIVED VERY THANKFULLY AND MANAGED VERY CAREFULLY LOOK MAMMA WHAT PRETTY LITTLE FEET THEY HAVE CRIED ELLEN I AM SURE CHARLES WAS A GOOD BOY TO THINK ABOUT SHOES FOR THEM WAS IT NOT VERY KIND OF HIM MATILDA
THEY HAVE SHORT FROCKS NOW BUT I PERCEIVE THEY HAVE NO SHOES SUPPOSE WE YOUNG ONES SUBSCRIBE AND BUY THEM SOME POOR THINGS THERE IS MY EIGHTEEN PENNY PIECE FOR SHOES MAMMA SHOES AND HATS TOO IF WE CAN RAISE MONEY ENOUGH
THAT YOU HAVE THE GOOD SENSE TO EXAMINE THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM MADE UPON YOU AND THAT YOU GIVE ACCORDINGLY YOU ARE AWARE AND I WISH ALL THE YOUNG ONES TO BE SO LIKEWISE THAT THIS ALTHOUGH AN ACT OF CHARITY IS NOT CALLED FOR BY ANY IMMEDIATE DISTRESS
WHEN MISTER HAREWOOD COMES IN I WILL ASK FOR THE MONEY AND TO MORROW WE WILL ALL GO IN THE COACH AND SEE MATILDA PURCHASE IT BUT MY DEAR GIRL SUPPOSE YOU JUST STEP AND INFORM THE POOR WOMAN OF YOUR INTENTION WHICH I AM CERTAIN YOU HAD RATHER DO WITHOUT WITNESSES
A SOMETHING WHICH SHOWED MISSUS HAREWOOD A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT WAS PASSING IN THE MIND OF THIS SELF CONVICTED BUT COMPASSIONATE AND INGENUOUS GIRL MISSUS HAREWOOD TOOK HER SHILLING AND RETURNED HER SIXPENCE
ABSORBED IN A LOVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN A CERTAIN LORD LUTESTRING AND A RUSTIC DAMSEL DAUGHTER OF ONE OF HIS TENANT FARMERS WHOSE LIFE HE IS DOING HIS BEST TO BLIGHT AND WITH MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCEEDING
SHE WAS A VERY DECENT WOMAN THE WIDOW OF A SOLDIER WHO DIED BEFORE HIS POOR CHILDREN WERE BORN SHE NOW ENDEAVOURED TO MAINTAIN HERSELF AND THEM BY TAKING IN WASHING TOGETHER WITH THE PAY OF THE PARISH WHICH ALTHOUGH SMALL
HAVE I INDEED SAID THE NOW HUMBLED GIRL YES YOU HAVE AN INQUIRING MIND WHICH IS ONE GREAT STEP TOWARDS THE ATTAINMENT OF KNOWLEDGE AND YOU ARE SINCERE AND OPEN HEARTED
IT WAS NOW NEAR CHRISTMAS AND MISSUS HAREWOOD WAS INQUIRING FOR A BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE SHE COULD PLACE MISS HANSON SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO KEEP HER AT HOME AND HAVE A GOVERNESS WHO MIGHT ATTEND TO THE INSTRUCTIONS NECESSARY BOTH FOR HER AND ELLEN
NO NO IT IS NOT EXACTLY THAT I AM CRYING FOR SAID MATILDA INTERRUPTING HER IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SO VERY NAUGHTY AND YOU ARE ALL SO SO SO
IT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE CASES WHICH WRING THE HEART AND DRAIN THE PURSE
SHE BLUSHED AND HUNG DOWN HER HEAD BUT ON PERCEIVING THAT MISSUS HAREWOOD WAS GOING TO RELEASE HER FROM ALL NECESSITY OF REPLY SHE STRUGGLED TO CONQUER WHAT SHE DEEMED A WEAKNESS IN HERSELF AND ANSWERED THUS
IF IT IS NOT A VERY GREAT SECRET I SHOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW WHAT THAT ONE OTHER THOUGHT IN YOUR HEART WAS WHICH I DID NOT GUESS UPON THIS OCCASION MATILDA DID NOT FIND THIS QUESTION SO EASY OF REPLY AS MISSUS HAREWOOD HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE
SHE MAKEE POOR NEGRO ALL HAPPY SINGEE AND DANCEE EVERY BODY NO MORE WHIP MASSA BUCKRAMAN EVERY BODY DELIGHT EVERY BODY GLAD EVERY BODY GOOD CHRISTIAN WHEN MISSY GO BACK
MISS LINTON HERSELF RECEIVES A SHOCK CAUSED BY A RAT TAT AT THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR LIGHT SUCH AS WELL TRAINED SERVANTS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO GIVE BEFORE ENTERING A ROOM OCCUPIED BY MASTER OR MISTRESS TO HER COMMAND COME IN
FOR THIS REASON HIS VICARIAL REPRESENTATIVE CAN PLEAD SCORES OF EXCUSES FOR PRESENTING HIMSELF AT THE COURT THERE IS THE SCHOOL THE CHURCH CHOIR AND CLOTHING CLUB TO SAY NOUGHT OF NEIGHBOURING NEWS WHICH ON MOST MORNINGS MAKE HIM A WELCOME VISITOR TO MISS LINTON
POSSIBLY FROM THE THOUGHT THAT THE DAYS OF HER LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP ARE DRAWING TO A CLOSE WHICH WILL MAKE HER A LESS IMPORTANT PERSONAGE AT LLANGORREN SURELY THEY WON'T BE OUT ALL DAY TIMIDLY SUGGESTS THE CURATE
YOU WENT AWAY AND LEFT ME VERY WILLINGLY THOUGH IT WAS TO WAIT ON A PERSON YOU NEVER SAW BEFORE AH MISSY YOU NO LOVEE ME AND POOR WHITE WOMAN LOVEE ME MUCH YOU MAKEE BEER SPIT IN MY FACE
I AM GLAD TO SEE THIS CHARLES IT IS A PROOF YOU ARE MORE PROVIDENT THAN YOU USED TO BE AND WITH YOUR PROPENSITY TO SPENDING IT REQUIRES NO LITTLE EFFORT TO SAVE IN A LARGE SCHOOL WHERE THERE ARE ALWAYS MANY TEMPTATIONS
AND THE IDEA OF HER HUMILITY AND KINDNESS IN THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT SO DEEPLY AFFECTED THE FAITHFUL CREATURE THAT AFTER GAZING AT HER IN ADMIRATION FOR A MOMENT SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND THEN CLASPING HER HANDS SHE EXCLAIMED IN A BROKEN MANNER
NO NO NOT BETTER SAID ELLEN WARMLY AND EVEN HER BROTHERS WHO LOVED HER VERY DEARLY STRUCK WITH THE SAME ADMIRATION OF MATILDA'S FRANKNESS AND GENEROSITY EXCLAIMED
MISSUS HAREWOOD FEELING FOR HER EVIDENT EMBARRASSMENT SENT THE POOR WOMAN DOWN STAIRS TO TAKE SOME REFRESHMENT AND THEN LAID A THREE SHILLING PIECE AS HER OWN SHARE OF THE CONTRIBUTION BESIDES CHARLES'S SUBSCRIPTION ON THE TABLE
BECAUSE THE THING'S IMPOSSIBLE THEY'VE ALREADY GONE ROWING INDEED CRY BOTH GENTLEMEN IN A BREATH SEEMING ALIKE VEXED BY THE INTELLIGENCE SHENSTONE MECHANICALLY INTERROGATING ON THE RIVER
AND EVERY MEMBER IN THE COMMUNITY OF WHICH A SCHOOL CONSISTS IS READY TO ASSIST THE RULER IN PUNISHING THE ONE AND LAUGHING AT THE OTHER ONE MORNING WHEN MATILDA GOT OUT OF BED SHE WENT TO LOOK WHETHER THE MORNING WAS FINE AND THE MOMENT SHE GOT TO THE WINDOW
BUT SHE WISHED VERY MUCH TO DO TWO VERY CONTRARY THINGS AND WHILST SHE STILL HESITATED MISS CAMPBELL SAID HERE IS ANOTHER SIXPENCE MA'AM WHICH I WILL TAKE AND GIVE YOU AN EIGHTEEN PENCE AS I WISH TO GIVE YOU A SHILLING WITH EDMUND'S PROVISO
IF YOU WERE TO GO FARTHER NORTH YOU WOULD FIND STILL MORE SNOW AND ICE THE SAME I SAW YOU LOOKING AT YESTERDAY I WILL LEND YOU A LITTLE BOOK WHERE YOU WILL SEE A DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE OF ICE AND OF WHOLE MOUNTAINS OF SNOW CALLED GLACIERS
THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS PLEASANTLY EMPLOYED IN ARRANGING THE POOR WOMAN'S NEW ACQUISITION AND WHEN MATILDA SAW HER GRATEFUL HAPPY COUNTENANCE AND LEARNED THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MACHINE WOULD BE WORKED AND ITS USEFULNESS IN SMOOTHING LINEN
KNOWING AS I DO THAT YOUR FORTUNE IS FULLY EQUAL TO ANY ACT OF CHARITY AND THAT YOUR GOOD MAMMA WILL NOT FAIL TO APPROVE OF IT
SHE FELT THE VALUE OF A USEFUL LIFE AND A SENSE OF HER OWN IMPORTANCE DISTINCT FROM THE IDLE CONSEQUENCE WHICH IS THE RESULT OF VANITY AND PRIDE
THE SPONTANEOUS EFFUSION OF JOY UTTERED BY THIS DAUGHTER OF NATURE AFFECTED ALL THE PARTY AND THE JOYFUL BUSTLE HAD NOT SUBSIDED WHEN MISTER HAREWOOD ENTERED ON BEING INFORMED OF THE CAUSE
OH THAT'S IT CRIED CHARLES GAILY THEN YOU AND I MAY SHAKE HANDS FOR I AM IGNORANT TOO OH NO EUROPEAN CHILDREN KNOW EVERY THING BUT I AM LITTLE BETTER THAN A NEGRO
SHE WAS A BELLE AND DID HER SHARE OF DANCING WITH A DUE PROPORTION OF FLIRTING AT THE REGENCY BALLS NO LONGER ABLE TO INDULGE IN SUCH DELIGHTFUL RECREATIONS THE MEMORY OF THEM HAS YET CHARMS FOR HER AND SHE KEEPS IT ALIVE AND WARM BY DAILY PERUSAL OF THE MORNING POST
BUT RECOLLECTING THAT ALL HER PAST SORROW HAD BEEN LAID TO THE PROPER ACCOUNT WHICH WAS HER OWN BAD TEMPER AND PRIDE SHE AGAIN PROCEEDED IN IT
THAT WAS WHAT I WANTED TO SAY FOR THERE WAS EDMUND WHO ALWAYS LOOKED SO GRAVE AND WAS PORING OVER HIS BOOKS HE TALKED TO ME QUITE KINDLY AND NEVER MADE THE LEAST GAME OF ME FOR ALL I MUST LOOK LIKE A FOOL IN HIS EYES WHO HAS SEEN THE SNOW ALL HIS LIFE
INDEED THE SECOND CALLER IS SHOWN IN FIRST FOR ALTHOUGH GEORGE SHENSTONE RUNG THE FRONT DOOR BELL AFTER MISTER MUSGRAVE HAD STEPPED INSIDE THE HALL THERE IS NO DOMESTIC OF LLANGORREN BUT KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RICH BARONET'S SON AND A POOR PARISH CURATE
AND NO DOUBT WOULD ON THIS BUT FOR THE GLAMOUR THROWN AROUND HER BY THE FASCINATIONS OF THE DEAR DELIGHTFUL LUTESTRING IT EVEN TAKES ALL HER PARTIALITY FOR MISTER SHENSTONE TO REMOVE ITS SPELL AND GET HIM VOUCHSAFED FRIENDLY RECEPTION
SHE KNEW THAT IN SCHOOLS TWO FAULTS SELDOM FAIL TO BE CURED THESE ARE IMPERTINENCE OR INSOLENCE AND AFFECTATION ONE RENDERING A PERSON DISAGREEABLE THE OTHER RIDICULOUS
AS IF THE ANGELS WERE EMPTYING FEATHER BEDS UPON THE EARTH IT SNOWS SAID ELLEN CALMLY I RECOLLECT MY PAPA TOLD US YOU HAD NEVER SEEN IT SNOW
BUT GWEN'S MAID INFORMS ME THEY LEFT THE HOUSE THEN AND I PRESUME THEY WENT DIRECT TO THE RIVER DO YOU THINK THEY'LL BE OUT LONG EARNESTLY INTERROGATES SHENSTONE I SHOULD HOPE NOT RETURNS THE ANCIENT TOAST OF CHELTENHAM WITH AGGRAVATING INDIFFERENCE
EDMUND LAID A SHILLING ON THE TABLE SAYING IF MORE IS WANTED I WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER WITH GREAT PLEASURE I HOPE MAMMA YOU KNOW THAT I WILL
CERTAINLY ANSWERS THE LADY LOOKING SURPRISED WHY GEORGE WHERE ELSE COULD THEY GO ROWING YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THEY'VE BROUGHT THE BOAT UP TO THE FISHPOND OH NO HE STAMMERS OUT I BEG PARDON HOW VERY STUPID OF ME TO ASK SUCH A QUESTION
THEN SIXPENCE IS AS MUCH AS YOU OUGHT TO GIVE SAID MISSUS HAREWOOD GIVING HER A SIXPENCE IN CHANGE WHEN OBSERVING THAT SHE TOOK IT WITH AN AIR OF RELUCTANCE SHE SAID MY DEAR ELLEN BE SATISFIED YOU ARE A LITTLE GIRL AND HAVE NOT HALF YOUR BROTHER'S ALLOWANCE YOU KNOW
BUT NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE WORD FROM HER WHOM IN HER HEART SHE STILL CONSIDERED AS HER YOUNG MISTRESS THE FAITHFUL CREATURE COULD NOT ENDURE AFTER WAITING SOME MINUTES IN VAIN SHE DROPPED A SECOND HUMBLE COURTESY AND SAID HOW YOU DO MISSY
NOW SHE SAW HOW MUCH IT WAS NOT ONLY HER DUTY BUT HAPPINESS TO DO SO AND MISTER HAREWOOD ASSURED HER THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT BUT IN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS HE SHOULD SEE HER AS SENSIBLE GOOD AND WELL INFORMED AS HIS OWN CHILDREN
AS IF IT WERE PAINTED WITH CINNABAR SAID OTTER ART THOU GOING BACK TO WOLFSTEAD SON YEA AT ONCE MY FATHER SAID ALI THEN TELL HER SAID OTTER
AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS HIGH NOON BY NOW
SINCE THEY SAW THAT THEY MIGHT NOT FALL UPON THE ROMANS TO LIVE AND DIE FOR IT UNTIL THIODOLF WAS COME OR UNTIL THEY KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT COMING
SO THAT THEY MIGHT GET THEM INTO THE WOOD SO HE DREW OUT OF BOWSHOT AND BADE HIS MEN BREATHE THEIR HORSES AND REST THEMSELVES AND EAT SOMETHING AND THEY DID SO GLADLY
SO RODE THEY OVER THE MEADOW AND INTO THE FORD AND OVER IT AND OTTER'S COMPANY STOOD ON THE BANK TO MEET THEM AND SHOUTED TO SEE THEM BUT THE OTHERS MADE BUT LITTLE NOISE AS THEY CROSSED THE WATER
TELL HER I WILL CAST THE DICE FOR LIFE OR DEATH
NOW THEN DO WHAT THOU WILT THEREWITH HE TURNED ABOUT AND WENT HIS WAY AT ONCE RUNNING LIKE A COLT WHICH HAS NEVER FELT HALTER OR BIT
AND PATTERED DOWN LIKE HAIL STONES
WHEN HE SHOULD COME INTO MID MARK SO OTTER AND HIS FOLK CROSSED THE FORD AND DREW UP IN GOOD ORDER ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND IT WAS THEN SOMEWHAT MORE THAN THREE HOURS AFTER NOON
THOUGH THIS IS NO HALLOWED THING TO BID US WHAT WE SHALL DO AND WHAT WE SHALL FORBEAR AND TO TALK THUS IS LESS LIKE WARRIORS THAN OLD WOMEN WRANGLING OVER THE WHY AND WHEREFORE OF A BROKEN CROCK
AND SOME DEEMED IT EVIL FOR ANGER AND DISSENSION BETWEEN FRIENDS SEEMED ABROAD BUT SOME WERE SO EAGER FOR BATTLE
OTTER FALLS ON AGAINST HIS WILL
THE ROMANS MAY NOT COME AT THEM TO HURT THEM
YE LINGER SONS OF THE WORM YE CROUCH ADOWN O KINDREDS FROM THE GATHERING OF THE STORM YE SAY IT SHALL SOON PASS OVER AND WE SHALL FARE AFIELD AND REAP THE WHEAT WITH THE WAR SWORD
WHILE A STRONG COMPANY KEPT FACE TO THE MARKMEN AND NOW OTTER SAW THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE HINDERED ANY LONGER AND HE HAD LOST MANY MEN AND EVEN NOW FEARED LEST HE SHOULD BE CAUGHT IN THE TRAP
NOR WERE THEY OTHERWISE THAN EXCEEDING GLAD
THE HORSEMEN FELL NOT ON THE ROMAN RANKS FULL IN FACE BUT PASSING LIKE A STORM ATHWART THE RANKS TO THE RIGHT FELL ON THERE WHERE THEY WERE IN THINNEST ARRAY FOR THEY WERE GATHERED TO THE FORD AS AFORESAID
AND THE SUNRISE WHICH WAS JUST AT HAND AND THE BANK MOREOVER WAS STONIER AND HIGHER THAN THE MEADOW'S FACE WHICH FELL AWAY FROM IT AS A SHALLOW DISH FROM ITS RIM THEREON YET LAY THE MIST
AND WILL TRY IF THE HOARY ELDERS MAY YET OUTLIVE THE WAY THAT LEADS TO THE SOUTHLAND CITIES TILL AT LAST THEY COME TO STAND WITH THE YOUNGLINGS IN THE MARKET TO BE SOLD IN AN ALIEN LAND
HIS BROW CLEARED AND THE ANXIOUS LINES IN THE FACE OF THE OLD MAN SMOOTHED THEMSELVES OUT AND AS HE RODE ALONG THE SOUL SO STIRRED WITHIN HIM THAT HE SANG OUT ALOUD
AND ALL THE MASS OF THEM FLOWED FORWARD TOGETHER LOOKING AS IF IT MIGHT NEVER BE BROKEN BUT OTTER WOULD NOT ABIDE THE SHOCK SINCE HE HAD LOST MEN AND HORSES
SO WHEN THEY WERE ON THE WESTERN BANK
AND WHEN HE COMETH WE SHALL BOTH TOGETHER FALL UPON THE ROMANS EITHER IN CROSSING THE FORD OR IN THE WOLFING MEADOW BUT TELL HER ALSO THAT I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HINDER THE ROMANS FROM CROSSING
WHEREIN JAVELINS AND SPEARS CAST BY THE HAND WERE MINGLED WITH THE ARROWS BUT THE ROMAN RANKS HAD FACED THE MEADOW AND THE STORM WHICH IT YIELDED SWIFTLY AND STEADILY
GET THEE BACK MY SON AND BID THE HALL SUN TRUST NOT TO WARDING OF THE HALL FOR THE ROMANS ARE A MIGHTY HOST AND THIS DAY EVEN WHEN THIODOLF COMETH HITHER
AND THE RED FLAME FLICKERED O'ER IT AND NEVER A STAINING WIGHT HATH RED EARTH IN HIS COFFER SO CLEAR AND GLITTERING BRIGHT AND STILL THE LITTLE SMOKE WREATHS CURLED O'ER IT PALE AND BLUE
BUT FOR THE ROMANS THEY WERE INDEED GETTING READY TO CROSS THE FORD WHEN THE MIST SHOULD HAVE RISEN AND ON THE BANK IT WAS THINNING ALREADY AND MELTING AWAY
AND STILL MORE AND MORE BELIEVING THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY BAND OF THEM THAT HE HAD TO LOOK TO BADE THOSE WHO WERE NIGHEST THE FORD NOT TO TARRY FOR THE ONSET OF A FEW WILD RIDERS
AND HAD NO MIND TO BE CAUGHT IN THE SWEEP OF THEIR NET SO HE MADE THE SIGN AND HIS COMPANY DREW OFF TO RIGHT AND LEFT YET KEEPING WITHIN BOWSHOT SO THAT THE BOWMEN STILL LOOSED AT THE ROMANS
AND AT LAST DREW SO NIGH THAT ONCE MORE THE ROMANS STORMED FORTH AND ONCE MORE SMOTE A STROKE IN THE AIR NOR EVEN SO WOULD THE MARKMEN CEASE TO MEDDLE WITH THEM
AND THEN WENT THEIR WAYS BUT OTTER SENT A MAN ON A SWIFT HORSE TO WATCH THEM AND WHEN THEY WERE CLEAN GONE FOR HALF AN HOUR HE BADE HIS FOLK TO HORSE AND THEY DEPARTED
AND THEREWITHAL BURST FORTH THE SOUND OF THE MARKMEN'S WAR HORN LIKE THE ROARING OF A HUNDRED BULLS MINGLED WITH THE THUNDER OF HORSES AT THE GALLOP
AND WITH AS LITTLE NOISE AS MIGHT BE SO DID THEY AND THERE WAS LITTLE DELAY FOR MEN WERE SLEEPING WITH ONE EYE OPEN AS FOLK SAY AND MANY WERE ALREADY ASTIR
THEN THE FOREMOST OF THOSE WHO HAD COME BACK FROM THE HOUSES WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE FORD BUT COULD SAY NOUGHT FOR A WHILE
BUT TURNED HIS HORSE AND RODE DOWN TO THE FORD AND ALL MEN FOLLOWED HIM AND OF THE BEARINGS THERE WERE AN HUNDRED WARRIORS SAVE ONE AND OF THE WORMINGS EIGHTY AND SEVEN
WITH JOYOUS SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER SO THEN THEY ORDERED THE RANKS ANEW AND SO SET FORWARD IN GREAT JOY WITHOUT HASTE OR TURMOIL
CAME UP AND SPAKE WARRIORS
AS THE ROMAN CAPTAIN KNEW SO THEY STOOD AWHILE MAKING GRIM COUNTENANCE AND THEN SLOWLY DREW BACK
YEA SAID OTTER SAID THE LAD I AM ALI THE SON OF GREY
NOR EVEN WHEN THOSE FOLK OF OTTER HAD TOLD THEM ALL THEY HAD TO TELL COULD SOME OF THEM REFRAIN THEM FROM RIDING OFF TO THE BURNT HOUSES TO SEEK FOR THE BODIES OF THEIR KINDRED BUT WHEN THEY CAME THERE
AN OLD LEADER OF A HUNDRED CRIED OUT THE SAME TIDINGS IN THE ROMAN TONGUE AND ALL MEN FELL TO HANDLING THEIR WEAPONS BUT BEFORE THEY COULD FACE DULY TOWARD THE MEADOW
LET THE WAR DUKE RULE AS IS BUT RIGHT
BUT OTTER RODE BACK HASTILY AND ROUSED CERTAIN MEN IN WHOM HE TRUSTED AND BID THEM ROUSE THE CAPTAINS AND ALL THE HOST AND BID MEN GET TO HORSE SPEEDILY
YET SHALL NOT TYR MAKE US NEW ONES OUT OF THE STONES OF THE WASTE TO WED WITH THE GALTINGS AND THE FISH EATING HOUSES THIS IS EASY TO BE DONE FORSOOTH YEA EASIER THAN FIGHTING THE ROMANS AND OVERCOMING THEM
THERE THE MORNING BEFORE HE THOUGHT THAT THE ROOF WAS HELD BY WARRIORS OF THE KINDREDS AND NOT BY A FEW OLD MEN AND WOMEN AND LADS THEREFORE HE HAD NO FEAR OF THEIR ESCAPING HIM
A FEW OF THE OTHERS RODE WITH THEM AND YET BUT A FEW FOR THEY REMEMBERED THE HOLY FOLK MOTE AND THE OATH OF THE WAR DUKE AND HOW THEY HAD CHOSEN OTTER TO BE THEIR LEADER
BUT AN OLD MAN OF THE BEARINGS
FOR ME AND MY HEART'S DELIVERANCE THAT HOUR WAS NEWLY WROUGHT I HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE HALLS OF MANHOOD I HAVE REACHED THE DOORS OF ELD AND I HAVE BEEN GLAD AND SORRY BUT EVER HAVE UPHELD
SAVE THE JOY OF FIGHTING FOR THE KINDRED AND THE DAYS TO BE SO OTTER LED THEM FORTH AND WHEN HE HEARD THE WHOLE COMPANY CLATTERING AND THUNDERING ON THE EARTH BEHIND HIM AND FELT THEIR MIGHT ENTER INTO HIM
AND SLEW SOME AND DRAVE SOME INTO THE DEEPS AND TROUBLED THE WHOLE ROMAN HOST SO NOW THE ROMAN CAPTAIN WAS FORCED TO TAKE NEW ORDER AND GATHER ALL HIS MEN TOGETHER AND ARRAY HIS MEN FOR A HARD FIGHT
WHERE WERE THE BONES OF THY MOTHER LYING SAID SWEINBIORN WE SOUGHT THE FEAST HALL OVER AND NOUGHT WE FOUND THEREIN OF THE BONES OF THE ANCIENT MOTHERS OR THE YOUNGLINGS OF THE KIN
BUT OTTER SPAKE SHARPLY FOR HE WAS GRIEVED THORBIORN THOU ART OLD AND SHOULDEST NOT BE VOID OF PRUDENCE
AND METHOUGHT ITS STAINING FAIR
THEY BICKER ABOUT THE FORD IN THE GREY OF THE MORNING WAS OTTER AFOOT WITH THE WATCHERS AND PRESENTLY HE GOT ON HIS HORSE AND PEERED OVER THE PLAIN BUT THE MIST YET HUNG LOW ON IT
AND THEY LAUGHED FOR PRIDE AND ANGER THEN OTTER ANSWERED MEEKLY FOR HE WAS A WISE MAN AND A BOLD WE FLED NOT
IT WAS A LAD OF FIFTEEN WINTERS NAKED SAVE HIS BREECHES AND WET FROM THE RIVER AND OTTER DREW REIN AND THE LAD SAID TO HIM ART THOU THE WAR DUKE
AND I CAME NEAR TO THEM AND NOTED WHAT THEY WERE DOING
HE WAVED HIS SWORD OVER HIS HEAD AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD SPUR ONWARD
LET THE WAR DUKE RULE HERE AS IS BUT MEET AND RIGHT YET IF I MIGHT SPEAK AND NOT BREAK THE PEACE OF THE GOTHS THEN WOULD I SAY THIS
ARINBIORN ANSWERED CALMLY MAYBE IN A LITTLE HOUR FROM NOW OR SOMEWHAT MORE SAID OTTER MY REDE IS THAT WE ABIDE HIM HERE
AND ALL MEN TO HEED WELL THE SIGNAL OF TURNING AND DRAWING ABACK AND THEREWITH THEY RODE OFF DOWN THE MEADOW LED BY MEN WHO COULD HAVE LED THEM THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT
BECAUSE OF THEIR HASTE SO THAT FEW WERE SLAIN BY THEM AND THE ROMAN CAPTAIN STILL LOTH TO FIGHT WITH THE GOTHS IN EARNEST FOR NO REWARD
THEN OTTER BADE THE WORD BE CARRIED DOWN THE RANKS THAT THEY SHOULD RIDE AS QUIETLY AS MAY BE AND FARE THROUGH THE MIST TO DO THE ROMANS SOME HURT
WHO SHOT AT THE GOTHS AS THEY RODE FORWARD BUT ABODE NOT THEIR SHOCK BUT OTTER AND HIS FOLK FOLLOWED AFTER THE ROMANS AGAIN AND AGAIN DID THEM SOME HURT
SPAKE TO THAT MAN AND SAID WHAT AILETH THEE SWEINBIORN THE BLACK WHAT HAST THOU SEEN HE SAID NOW RED AND GREY IS THE PAVEMENT OF THE BEARINGS HOUSE OF OLD
AND HE WAS VERY WRATH AND TURNED AWAY AND AGAIN THERE WAS A MURMUR AND A HUM ABOUT HIM BUT WHILE THESE HAD BEEN SPEAKING ALOUD
AND BADE CERTAIN MEN ABIDE AT THE FORD FOR A GUARD THEN HE DREW HIS SWORD AND RODE TO THE FRONT OF HIS FOLK AND CRIED OUT ALOUD TO THEM NOW AT LAST HAS COME THE TIME TO DIE
AND THEN DARK OVER THE WALL OF MIST SHOWED THE CRESTS OF THE RIDERS OF THE MARK THOUGH SCARCE WERE THEIR HORSES SEEN TILL THEIR WHOLE WAR RANK CAME DARK AND GLITTERING
BUT TO GO THEIR WAYS INTO THE WATER ELSE BY A SUDDEN ONRUSH MIGHT THE ROMANS HAVE ENTANGLED OTTER'S BAND IN THEIR RANKS AND SO DESTROYED ALL AS IT WAS
AND THE REST OF THE HOST WAS DRAWN UP IN GOOD ORDER BAND BY BAND
THEN ON HE RODE NOR LOOKED BEHIND HIM AND THE RIDERS OF THE BEARINGS AND THE WORMINGS DREW THEMSELVES OUT OF THE THRONG AND FOLLOWED HIM AND RODE CLATTERING OVER THE MEADOW TOWARDS WOLFSTEAD
FOR WE HAVE DISCOMFITED THEIR VANGUARD ALREADY AND WE HAVE FOLK WHO CAN FIGHT
BUT THE ROMANS CROSSED THE FORD IN GOOD EARNEST AND WERE SOON ALL GATHERED TOGETHER ON THE WESTERN BANK MAKING THEM READY FOR THE MARCH TO WOLFSTEAD AND IT MUST BE TOLD THAT THE ROMAN CAPTAIN
THAT IT MIGHT BE BETTER FOR US TO FALL ON THESE ROMANS AT ONCE BEFORE THEY HAVE CAST UP A DIKE ABOUT THEM AS FOX TELLETH IS THEIR WONT AND THAT EVEN IN AN HOUR THEY MAY DO MUCH
BUT THEY FOR THEIR PART MIGHT NOT FOLLOW AFOOT MEN ON UNTIRED HORSES AND THEIR OWN HORSE WAS ON THE WEST SIDE WITH THE BAGGAGE
SWEINBIORN HAD BEEN TALKING SOFTLY TO SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEN AND NOW HE SHOOK HIS NAKED SWORD IN THE AIR AND SPAKE ALOUD AND SANG YE TARRY BEARS OF BATTLE
AND WHEN WE ARE ALL MET AND WELL ORDERED TOGETHER FALL ON THE ROMANS AT ONCE FOR THEN SHALL WE BE MORE THAN THEY WHEREAS NOW WE ARE FAR FEWER AND MOREOVER WE SHALL HAVE TO SET ON THEM IN THEIR GROUND OF VANTAGE
WORKING IN HIM BELIKE THAT THE ROMAN CAPTAIN SET NONE TO GUARD THE FORD ON THE WESTWARD SIDE OF MIRKWOOD WATER THE ROMANS TARRIED THERE BUT A LITTLE HOUR
AND THE ROOF EXCEEDING HIGH FOR NOUGHT THERE WAS TO LOOK ON TWIXT THE PAVEMENT AND THE SKY
THAT THEY MAY HAVE OTHER THINGS TO THINK OF THAN BURNING OLD MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THEIR DWELLINGS THUS MAY SHE REACH THE WOOD UNHINDERED HAST THOU ALL THIS IN THINE HEAD
THOU ART ALIVE AND UNHURT WAR DUKE WHEN MANY HAVE BEEN HURT AND SLAIN AND METHINKS THY COMPANY IS LITTLE MINISHED THOUGH THE KINDRED OF THE BEARINGS LACKETH A ROOF
WHAT SAWEST THOU THEREIN O SWEINBIORN
BUT AS THE SWORD FLEETH WHEN IT SPRINGETH UP FROM THE IRON HELM TO FALL ON THE WOOLLEN COAT ARE WE NOT NOW OF MORE AVAIL TO YOU O MEN OF THE BEARINGS THAN OUR DEAD CORPSES WOULD HAVE BEEN
HAD YE TIME TO LEARN ALL THIS OTTER WHEN YE FLED SO FAST BEFORE THE ROMANS THAT THE FATHER TARRIED NOT FOR THE SON NOR THE SON FOR THE FATHER HE SPOKE IN A LOUD VOICE SO THAT MANY HEARD HIM
AND LET THEM OF THE MARKMEN WHO LIVE HEREAFTER LAY US IN HOWE SET ON SONS OF TYR AND GIVE NOT YOUR LIVES AWAY BUT LET THEM BE DEARLY EARNED OF OUR FOEMEN
TIME WAS WHEN HOT WAS THE SUMMER AND I WAS YOUNG ON THE EARTH AND I GRUDGED ME EVERY MOMENT THAT LACKED ITS SHARE OF MIRTH
THEN GO THY WAYS BUT THE LAD LINGERED AND HE REDDENED AND LOOKED ON THE GROUND AND THEN HE SAID MY FATHER
MAN LOOKED ASKANCE AT MAN AS IF IN SHAME TO BE LEFT BEHIND BUT OTTER BETHOUGHT HIM IN THE FLASH OF A MOMENT IF THESE MEN RIDE ALONE THEY SHALL DIE AND DO NOTHING
AND THE SUN WAS BRIGHT AND HOT HIS MEN SERRIED THEIR RANKS AND THE FRONT RANK CAST THEIR SPEARS
ALL SAVE A HANDFUL OF THE SWAINS AND ELDERS
BELIKE IT WERE BETTER TO LEAVE THE HALL AND LET THE WOOD COVER US
AND SLEW BOTH MEN AND HORSES OF THE GOTHS AS THOSE RODE ALONG THEIR FRONT CASTING THEIR JAVELINS AND SHOOTING HERE AND THERE FROM BEHIND THEIR HORSES IF OCCASION SERVED OR MAKING A SHIFT TO SEND AN ARROW EVEN AS THEY SAT A HORSEBACK
SO THEY RODE BACK TO WHERE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FOLK TALKING WITH THEM OF OTTER AND THE BEARINGS WERE SITTING GRIM UPON THEIR HORSES AND SOMEWHAT SCOWLING ON OTTER'S MEN
WHEN TWIXT THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS AND THE EDGES OF THE SEA THESE MEN HAVE SWEPT THE WILD WOOD AND THE FIELDS WHERE MEN MAY BE OF EVERY LIVING SWORD BLADE AND EVERY QUIVERING SPEAR
THOUGH NEVER WOULD OTTER SUFFER HIS MEN TO BE MINGLED WITH THEM AT THE LAST THE ROMANS SEEING THAT OTTER WOULD NOT WALK INTO THE OPEN TRAP AND GROWING WEARY OF THIS BICKERING BEGAN TO TAKE THE WATER LITTLE BY LITTLE
SHALL BE HARD FOR THE GOTH FOLK LET HER HASTEN LEST THESE THIEVES COME UPON HER HASTILY LET HER TAKE THE HALL SUN HER NAMESAKE AND THE OLD MEN AND CHILDREN AND THE WOMEN
FATHER SAID ALI THE HALL SUN SAITH THOU ART WISE IN WAR NOW TELL US SHALL WE HOLD THE HALL AGAINST THE ROMANS THAT YE MAY FIND US THERE
SO THAT HE MIGHT SEE NOUGHT FOR A WHILE BUT AT LAST HE SEEMED TO NOTE SOMETHING COMING TOWARD THE HOST FROM THE UPPER WATER ABOVE THE FORD SO HE RODE FORWARD TO MEET IT AND LO
AND SAW THAT HE WAS MERRY HOWBEIT FEW HEARD HIS VERY WORDS AND YET ALL WERE GLAD OF HIM FAST THEY RODE BEING WISHFUL TO CATCH UP WITH THE BEARINGS AND THE WORMINGS AND SOON THEY CAME ANIGH THEM
THEN SWEINBIORN TOSSED UP HIS SWORD INTO THE AIR AND CAUGHT IT BY THE HILTS AS IT FELL AND CRIED OUT ON ON TO THE MEADOW WHERE THESE THIEVES ABIDE US
LIKE A WHITE WALL SO THE ROMANS AND THEIR FRIENDS THE DASTARDS OF THE GOTHS HAD WELL NIGH GOT ALL READY AND HAD DRIVEN STAKES INTO THE WATER FROM BANK TO BANK TO MARK OUT THE SAFE FORD
AND IN THE SOUTHLAND CITIES THE YOKE OF SLAVES YE BEAR LO YE WHOEVER FOLLOWS I FARE TO SOW THE SEED OF THE DAYS TO BE HEREAFTER AND THE DEED THAT COMES OF DEED THEREWITH
SO IN A LITTLE WHILE THEY WERE ALL IN THE SADDLE AND THE MIST YET STRETCHED LOW OVER THE MEADOW FOR THE MORNING WAS COOL AND WITHOUT WIND
AS NOW AT LAST IT COMETH WHEN E E N IN SUCH LIKE TIDE FOR THE FREEING OF MY TROUBLE O'ER THE FATHERS FIELD I RIDE MANY MEN PERCEIVED THAT HE SANG
WHERE THEN IS OTTER WHERE IS THE WAR DUKE IS HE ALIVE OR DEAD AND THE THRONG OPENED TO HIM AND OTTER STOOD FACING HIM
THEN THORBIORN REDDENED AND WAS WROTH
THAT YE STAND HERE WITH CLEAN BLADES AND COLD BODIES SAID OTTER THOU GRIEVEST FOR THE HURT OF THINE HOUSE ARINBIORN BUT THIS AT LEAST IS GOOD
AND IF MUCH DIKING SHALL BE DONE IN AN HOUR YET LITTLE SLAYING FORSOOTH SHALL BE DONE AND THAT ESPECIALLY IF THE FOE IS ALL ARMED AND SLAYETH WOMEN AND CHILDREN YEA IF THE BEARING WOMEN BE ALL SLAIN
MY HEART AGAINST ALL TROUBLE THAT NONE MIGHT CALL ME SAD BUT NE'ER CAME SUCH REMEMBRANCE OF HOW MY HEART WAS GLAD IN THE AFTERNOON OF SUMMER NEATH THE STILL UNWEARIED SUN OF THE DAYS WHEN I WAS LITTLE
THE SHELL IS GONE BUT THE KERNEL IS SAVED FOR THY FOLK ARE BY THIS TIME IN THE WOOD WITH THE WOLFING STAY AT HOMES
BUT THE HEARTH ALL GREY AND COLD I KNEW NOT THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS I COULD NOT CALL TO MIND THE FASHION OF THE BUILDING OF THAT WARDER OF THE WIND O WIDE WERE GROWN THE WINDOWS
COME YE SONS OF THE BEAR YE CHILDREN OF THE WORM
AND MOST OF THEIR GOTHS WERE BY NOW IN THE WATER OR UP ON THE WOLFING MEADOW
AND THE WORMINGS FOR THEY HAD OUT GONE THE OTHERS WHO WERE AFOOT IT MAY WELL BE THOUGHT HOW FEARFUL WAS THEIR ANGER WHEN THEY SET EYES ON THE SMOULDERING ASHES OF THE DWELLINGS
YEA FAIR IS OUR HALL'S ADORNING FOR A FEAST THAT IS STRANGE AND NEW
AND WE DEEM IT CERTAIN THAT THEY CROSSED THE WATER BEFORE THE COMING OF THE ROMANS AND THAT THEY ARE NOW WITH THE STAY AT HOMES OF THE WOLFINGS IN THE WILD WOOD BEHIND THE WOLFING DWELLINGS FOR WE HEAR TELL THAT THE WAR DUKE
AND AMIDST THE ASHES COULD FIND NO BONES THEIR HEARTS WERE LIGHTENED AND YET SO MAD WROTH THEY WERE THAT SOME COULD SCARCE SIT THEIR HORSES AND GREAT TEARS GUSHED FROM THE EYES OF SOME
AND LET THOSE FIGHTING FOLK SHE HATH BE A GUARD TO ALL THIS IN THE WOOD AND HEARKEN MOREOVER IT WILL MAYBE
AS IF HE WERE STRUGGLING WITH A WEIGHT HARD TO LIFT THEN SAID OTTER
WAS THE MORE DELIBERATE ABOUT THIS
AND IF WE RIDE WITH THEM IT MAY BE THAT WE SHALL OVERTHROW THE ROMANS AND IF WE BE VANQUISHED IT SHALL GO HARD BUT WE SHALL SLAY MANY OF THEM
OF A SUDDEN ONE OF THE DASTARDS OF THE GOTHS WHO WAS CLOSE TO THE CAPTAIN CRIED OUT THAT HE HEARD HORSE COMING BUT BECAUSE HE SPAKE IN THE GOTHIC TONGUE FEW HEEDED BUT EVEN THEREWITH
INTO THE SPACE OF THE RISING GROUND WHERE THE MIST WAS BUT A HAZE NOW AND NOW AT LAST SMITTEN ATHWART BY THE LOW SUN JUST ARISEN THEREWITH CAME ANOTHER STORM OF SHAFTS
WHO HAD GOTTEN OUT OF THE WOOD AND HAD FALLEN IN WITH THE MEN WHOM HE HAD LEFT BEHIND
WHERE THE SUN SET GLORIOUSLY BEHIND THE PURPLE HILLS ALL BELOW WAS WRAPPED IN MIST AND NOT A SOUND REACHED HIM BUT THE SIGH OF THE PINE AND THE MURMUR OF THE WATERFALL THIS IS A FIRST CLASS SCRAPE
AND PROWLS BY NIGHT ABNER SAID THEY PURRED AND SNARLED AND GAVE A MEWING SORT OF CRY BUT WHICH IT WAS NOW HE COULD NOT TELL HAVING UNFORTUNATELY BEEN HALF ASLEEP
AS THE BOY PAINFULLY CLIMBED SLIPPED AND SWUNG ALONG FEARING EVERY MINUTE TO COME TO SOME IMPASSABLE BARRIER IN THE DANGEROUS PATH BUT HE GOT ON WONDERFULLY WELL AND WAS FEELING MUCH ENCOURAGED WHEN HIS FOOT SLIPPED THE ROOT HE HELD GAVE WAY
MISTY AND WHITE BELOW HIM HE LAY A FEW MINUTES DROWSILY MUSING FOR THE FALL HAD STUNNED HIM THEN AS HE MOVED HIS HAND SOMETHING PRICKED IT AND HE FELT PINE NEEDLES IN THE FINGERS THAT CLOSED OVER THEM CAUGHT IN A TREE BY JUPITER
CORNY SLIPPED INTO THE WOOD LEAVING THE GOOD LADY WITH HER THANKS HALF SPOKEN SITTING ON A WARM STONE BESIDE A MUDDY LITTLE POOL A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED HIM AS HE SCRAMBLED THROUGH THE TALL FERNS AND WENT PLUNGING DOWN THE STEEP MOUNTAIN SIDE EAGER TO REACH THE LOWER WOODS
SET THERE TO SAVE A LIFE AND TEACH A LESSON TO A WILFUL YOUNG HEART THAT NEVER FORGOT THAT HOUR HOLDING FAST LEST A RASH MOTION SHOULD SET HIM BOUNDING FURTHER DOWN LIKE A LIVING BALL
BUT HIS PRIDE REBELLED AGAINST RETURNING EMPTY HANDED AFTER ALL HIS PLANS AND BOASTS OF GREAT EXPLOITS I WON'T GO HOME TO BE LAUGHED AT BY CHRIS AND ABNER I'LL SHOOT SOMETHING IF I STAY ALL NIGHT
SO HE WASHED AS WELL AS HE COULD HOPING THE SUN WOULD DRY HIM PICKED OUT A FEW BITS OF BREAD UNSPOILED BY THE GENERAL WRECK AND TRUDGED ON WITH LESS ARDOR THOUGH BY NO MEANS DISCOURAGED YET
FOR THE SPOT WAS LONELY AND LOVELY ENOUGH TO SUIT ANY HUNTER THE TALLEST PINES HE EVER SAW SIGHED FAR OVERHEAD THE GROUND WAS ANKLE DEEP IN MOSS AND GAY WITH SCARLET BUNCH BERRIES
AND FINISHED HIS MEAL WITH GRASS AND PINE NEEDLES CALLING HIMSELF A CALF AND WISHING HIS PASTURE WERE WIDER THE FELLOWS WE READ ABOUT ALWAYS COME TO GRIEF IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN SHOOT A BIRD CATCH A FISH
AND IF YOU WON'T GO AND BLAB I'LL TELL YOU A PLAN I MADE LAST NIGHT GUESS YOU CAN TRUST ME I'VE HEARD ABOUT A DOZEN PLANS NOW AND NEVER TOLD ONE OF EM THEY ALL FAILED SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO TELL
ABNER AND I WILL BE ALONG AND IF YOU GET INTO A SCRAPE JEST GIVE A YELL AND WE'LL COME NO FEAR OF THAT I'VE TRAMPED ROUND ALL SUMMER AND KNOW MY WAY LIKE AN INDIAN KEEP THE GIRLS QUIET AND LET ME HAVE A GOOD LARK I'LL TURN UP ALL RIGHT BY SUNDOWN
IT SHOULD BE DONE AND AWAY HE WENT CLIMBING TUMBLING LEAPING FROM ROCK TO ROCK TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE THE EAGLE HAD ALIGHTED MORE CUTS AND BRUISES MORE VAIN SHOTS
HE DID HIS BEST BUT WHEN THEY PASSED OPENING AFTER OPENING INTO THE GREEN RECESSES OF THE WOOD AND THE GRANITE BOULDERS GREW MORE AND MORE PLENTIFUL HIS PATIENCE GAVE OUT AND HE BEGAN TO PLAN WHAT HE COULD SAY TO EXCUSE HIMSELF CHRIS WAS BEHIND
AS HE LEANED BREATHLESS AND WEARY AGAINST THE CRAG WHERE HE HAD FONDLY HOPED TO FIND THE EAGLE'S NEST HE REALIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT A FOOL HARDY THING HE HAD DONE HERE HE WAS ALONE WITHOUT A GUIDE
FOR THE CITY LAD WAS UNUSED TO SUCH VIOLENT EXERCISE PLUCKY AS HE WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO NOW IS TO GET DOWN TO THE VALLEY IF I CAN BEFORE DARK ABNER SAID THERE WAS AN OLD CABIN WHERE THE HUNTERS USED TO SLEEP
CORNY'S CATAMOUNT TWO BOYS SAT ON THE BARS ONE WHITTLING THE OTHER WHISTLING NOT FOR WANT OF THOUGHT BY ANY MEANS FOR HIS BROW WAS KNIT IN AN ANXIOUS FROWN AND HE PAUSED NOW AND THEN TO THUMP THE RAIL WITH AN IMPATIENT EXCLAMATION
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE PRETTY SPRY THEN FOR THERE'S ONLY TWO MORE DAYS TO AUGUST REPLIED THE WHITTLER SHUTTING ONE EYE TO LOOK ALONG HIS ARROW AND SEE IF IT WAS TRUE I INTEND TO BE SPRY
AND DOWN HE WENT ROLLING AND BUMPING TO HIS DEATH ON THE ROCKS BELOW HE THOUGHT AS A CRASH CAME AND HE KNEW NO MORE
AS HE GLANCED AT CORNY AND THEN AWAY TO THE VAST FOREST THAT STRETCHED FAR UP THE MIGHTY MOUNTAIN'S SIDE NO I DON'T WANT ANY HELP AND BUFF WILL BETRAY ME BY BARKING I PREFER TO GO ALONE I SHALL TAKE SOME LUNCH AND PLENTY OF SHOT AND HAVE A GLORIOUS TIME
DON'T WORRY MAMMY I'M OLD ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I'LL SEE TO HIM MA'AM CALLED CHRIS AS HE HUNG ON BEHIND AND WAVED HIS OLD STRAW HAT WITH A STEADY RELIABLE SORT OF LOOK THAT MADE THE ANXIOUS LADY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
EVERY FALLEN LOG WAS VEILED BY SWEET SCENTED LINNEA GREEN VINES OR NODDING BRAKES WHILE HIDDEN BROOKS SANG MUSICALLY AND THE AIR WAS FULL OF THE SOFT FLUTTER OF LEAVES THE WHIR OF WINGS
THOUGH HE GRINNED CHEERFULLY WHEN POOR CORNY LOOKED ROUND AND BECKONED AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH A GUN ON ONE ARM AND A STOUT LADY ON THE OTHER THE HARDEST PART IS COMING NOW AND WE'D BETTER REST A MOMENT
LOOKING SO EXCITED AND IMPRESSED BY THE RECKLESS COURAGE OF HIS MATE THAT CORNY FELT HIMSELF A LEATHERSTOCKING AND WENT OFF TO TEA WITH HIS FINGER ON HIS LIPS FULL OF BOYISH FAITH IN HIS OWN POWERS IF HE HAD SEEN CHRIS DART BEHIND THE BARN
I'M TOO HIGH FOR ANY GAME BUT BIRDS AND THOSE I DON'T WANT I'LL GO SLAP DOWN AND COME OUT IN THE VALLEY ABNER SAID ANY BROOK WOULD SHOW THE WAY AND THIS RASCAL THAT LED ME INTO A SCRAPE SHALL LEAD ME OUT HE SAID
ON THE FIRST FALLEN LOG THEY CAME TO AND MAKE HIS ESCAPE BUT MISSUS BARKER GOT ON BRAVELY WITH THE SUPPORT OF HIS STRONG ARM AND CHATTED AWAY SO DELIGHTFULLY THAT CORNY WOULD REALLY HAVE ENJOYED THE WALK IF HIS SOUL HAD NOT BEEN YEARNING FOR CATAMOUNTS
AND HE SAT LOOKING AT THE SOLEMN SKY FULL OF STARS THAT SEEMED WATCHING OVER HIM ALONE THERE LIKE A POOR LOST CHILD ON THE GREAT MOUNTAIN'S STONY BREAST HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE WORLD AT THAT HOUR BEFORE
WITH HIS LONG LEGS DANGLING INTO SPACE SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU NEEDED EVERY MITE OF IT HUNTING IS MIGHTY HARD WORK ON A HOT DAY AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A BLAZER ANSWERED CHRIS PULLING HIS BIG STRAW HAT LOWER OVER HIS EYES
WITHOUT A LITTLE HELP SAID THE POOR LADY RED AND PANTING WITH THE HEAT AND STEEPNESS OF THE ROAD CERTAINLY MA'AM ANSWERED CORNY OBEYING AT ONCE AND INWARDLY RESOLVING TO DEPOSIT HIS FAIR BURDEN
HE WAS MUCH SHAKEN BY THE FALL HIS FLESH BRUISED HIS CLOTHES TORN AND HIS SPIRIT COWED FOR HUNGER WEARINESS PAIN AND DANGER SHOWED HIM WHAT A VERY FEEBLE CREATURE HE WAS AFTER ALL
AS WE INTEND TO FOLLOW CORNY'S ADVENTURES WE NEED NOT PAUSE TO DESCRIBE THE DRIVE WHICH WAS A MERRY ONE WITH GIRLS CHATTERING MAMMAS HOLDING ON TO EXCITED SMALL BOYS IN DANGER OF FLYING OUT AT EVERY JOLT ABNER JOKING TILL EVERY ONE ROARED
HE COULD DO NO MORE TILL MORNING AND RESIGNED HIMSELF TO A NIGHT ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE GLAD TO BE THERE ALIVE THOUGH DOUBTFUL WHAT DAYLIGHT WOULD SHOW HIM TOO TIRED TO MOVE HE LAY WATCHING THE WESTERN SKY
FOR THE FROLICSOME STREAM WENT HEADLONG OVER ROCKS CREPT UNDER FALLEN LOGS AND NOW AND THEN HID ITSELF SO CLEVERLY THAT ONE HAD TO LOOK AND LISTEN CAREFULLY TO RECOVER THE TRAIL IT WAS LONG PAST NOON WHEN CORNY CAME OUT NEAR THE WATERFALL
WHAT A FOOL I WAS NOT TO GO BACK WHEN I COULD INSTEAD OF BLUNDERING DOWN HERE WHERE NO ONE CAN GET AT ME AND AS LIKE AS NOT I CAN'T GET OUT ALONE GUN SMASHED IN THAT CONFOUNDED FALL SO I CAN'T EVEN FIRE A SHOT TO CALL HELP
CORNY'S DANGEROUS EVOLUTIONS WITH THE BELOVED GUN AND THE GYMNASTIC FEATS CHRIS PERFORMED JUMPING OFF TO PICK FLOWERS FOR THE LADIES AND GETTING ON AGAIN WHILE MILK AND MOLASSES TORE UP AND DOWN THE ROUGH ROAD AS IF THEY ENJOYED IT
SHOULDN'T WONDER IF I'D GOT POISONED A BIT WITH SOME OF THESE VINES I'VE BEEN TEARING THROUGH MY HANDS SMART LIKE FURY AND I GUESS THE MOSQUITOES HAVE ABOUT EATEN MY FACE UP NEVER SAW SUCH CLOUDS OF STINGERS BEFORE SAID CORNY
CHRIS CAN'T LEAVE THE REST TO FOLLOW AND IF I ONCE GET A GOOD START THEY WON'T CATCH ME IN A HURRY THOUGHT THE BOY LONGING TO BE FREE AND ALONE IN THE WILD WOODS THAT TEMPTED HIM ON EITHER HAND JUST AS HE WAS TIGHTENING HIS BELT TO BE READY FOR THE RUN
WE ARE GOING TO WALK UP AND LEAVE THE HORSES TO REST SO I CAN CHOOSE MY TIME SEE I'VE GOT A BOTTLE OF COLD TEA IN THIS POCKET AND A LOT OF GRUB IN THE OTHER NO DANGER OF MY STARVING IS THERE WHISPERED CORNY AS HE LEANED OVER TO CHRIS WHO SAT APPARENTLY ON NOTHING
HERE'S A MESS THOUGHT POOR CORNY
ENJOYING THE SPLENDID VIEW FAR OVER VALLEY AND INTERVALE THROUGH THE GAP IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE HE WAS DESPERATELY TIRED WITH THESE HOURS OF ROUGH TRAVEL AND VERY HUNGRY BUT WOULD NOT OWN IT AND SAT CONSIDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT
AND ALL VISIONS OF HEAVEN VANISHED IN A BREATH AS HE SAT UP AND STARED ABOUT HIM WIDE AWAKE NOW AND CONSCIOUS OF MANY ACHING BONES YES THERE HE LAY AMONG THE BRANCHES OF ONE OF THE STURDY PINES INTO WHICH HE HAD FALLEN ON HIS WAY DOWN THE PRECIPICE
MISSUS BARKER THE STOUT LADY CALLED HIM AND BEING A WELL BRED LAD HE HASTENED AT ONCE TO SEE WHAT SHE WANTED FEELING THAT HE WAS THE ONLY GENTLEMAN IN THE PARTY GIVE ME YOUR ARM DEAR I'M GETTING VERY TIRED AND FEAR I CAN'T HOLD OUT TO THE TOP
A DREAM CAME AND HE SAW THE OLD FARM HOUSE IN SAD CONFUSION CAUSED BY HIS ABSENCE THE WOMEN CRYING THE MEN SOBER ALL ANXIOUS AND ALL MAKING READY TO COME AND LOOK FOR HIM
FOR HE SAW BY THE SUN THAT THE AFTERNOON WAS HALF OVER THERE WAS TIME TO GO BACK THE WAY HE HAD COME AND BY FOLLOWING THE PATH DOWN THE HILL HE COULD REACH THE HOTEL AND GET SUPPER AND A BED OR BE DRIVEN HOME THAT WAS THE WISE THING TO DO
PRETENDING THAT HE DID NOT CARE FOR SUCH SMALL GAME NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL FUN HE SAID TO HIMSELF TRAMPING GAYLY ALONG AND AT THAT MOMENT WENT SPLASH INTO A MUD HOLE CONCEALED UNDER THE GRASS
AS HE FOLLOWED THE LITTLE STREAM THAT WENT TUMBLING OVER THE STONES THAT INCREASED AS THE GROUND SLOPED TOWARD THE DEEP RAVINE WHERE A WATERFALL SHONE LIKE SILVER IN THE SUN I'LL TAKE A BATH IF THE POOL IS BIG ENOUGH AND THAT WILL SET ME UP
AND VERY HAPPY FOR HE HAD HIS OWN WAY AT LAST AND A WHOLE DAY TO LEAD THE LIFE HE LOVED SO HE BATHED HIS HOT FACE TOOK A COOL DRINK AND LAY ON THE MOSS STARING UP INTO THE GREEN GLOOM OF THE PINES
WAITING FOR A GOOD CHANCE TO PLUNGE HE WANTED TO BE OFF BEFORE ABNER CAME AS HE WELL KNEW THAT WISE MAN AND MIGHTY HUNTER WOULD NEVER LET HIM GO ALONE THE VERY NEXT PATH I SEE I'LL DIVE IN AND RUN
STILL BRAVELY TRYING TO AFFECT THE INDIFFERENCE TO DANGER AND FATIGUE WHICH HUNTERS ARE ALWAYS DESCRIBED AS POSSESSING IN SUCH A REMARKABLE DEGREE CORNY SLUNG THE USELESS GUN ON HIS BACK AND BEGAN THE STEEP DESCENT
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK THEY REACHED THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN AND AFTER A SHORT REST AT THE HOTEL BEGAN THE THREE MILE ASCENT IN HIGH SPIRITS ABNER WAS TO FOLLOW LATER WITH THE WAGON TO BRING THE PARTY DOWN SO CHRIS WAS GUIDE
A PRETTY HARD PROSPECT EITHER WAY THE SIGHT OF AN EAGLE SOARING ABOVE HIM SEEMED TO ANSWER HIS QUESTION AND FILL HIM WITH NEW STRENGTH AND ARDOR TO SHOOT THE KING OF BIRDS AND TAKE HIM HOME IN TRIUMPH WOULD COVER THE HUNTER WITH GLORY
I'LL PULL THROUGH I GUESS AND WHEN IT'S ALL OVER IT WILL BE A JOLLY GOOD STORY TO TELL THEN HOPING TO FORGET HIS WOES IN SLEEP HE NESTLED UNDER THE LOW GROWING BRANCHES OF THE PINE AND LAY BLINKING DROWSILY AT THE TWILIGHT WORLD OUTSIDE
HE SUNK UP TO HIS KNEES AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY GOT OUT BY CLINGING TO THE TUSSOCKS THAT GREW NEAR IN HIS STRUGGLES THE LUNCH WAS LOST FOR THE BOTTLE BROKE AND THE POCKET WHERE THE SANDWICHES WERE STORED WAS FULL OF MUD
AS HE KNEW THE WAY WELL AND OFTEN CAME WITH PEOPLE THE GIRLS AND YOUNGER BOYS HURRIED ON FULL OF EAGERNESS TO REACH THE TOP THE LADIES WENT MORE SLOWLY ENJOYING THE GRAND BEAUTY OF THE SCENE WHILE CHRIS CARRIED THE LUNCH BASKET AND CORNY LINGERED IN THE REAR
BUT IT'S NOT MY FUNERAL SO I WON'T MEDDLE HOPE YOU'LL HAVE FIRST RATE SPORT AND BAG A BRACE OF CATS ONE THING YOU MIND DON'T GET TOO NIGH BEFORE YOU FIRE AND KEEP OUT OF SIGHT OF THE CRITTERS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN CHRIS SPOKE IN A DEEP WHISPER
I'M NOT LUCKY ENOUGH EVEN TO FIND A SASSAFRAS BUSH TO CHEW OR A BIRD'S EGG TO SUCK MY POOR GUN IS BROKEN OR I MIGHT BANG AWAY AT A HAWK AND COOK HIM FOR SUPPER IF THE BOG DIDN'T SPOIL MY MATCHES AS IT DID MY LUNCH OH WELL
THE SOUND OF BIRDS GOSSIPING SWEETLY IN THE SAFE SHELTER OF THE FOREST WHERE HUMAN FEET SO SELDOM CAME I'LL REST A BIT AND THEN GO ALONG DOWN KEEPING A LOOK OUT FOR PUSS BY THE WAY THOUGHT CORNY FEELING SAFE AND FREE
IN A HURRY TO BE OFF AS THE LUNCH BASKET WAS HANDED UP AND THE SMALL BOYS PACKED IN THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE CORNERS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ARMS AND LEGS AWAY THEY RATTLED WITH A PARTING CHEER AND PEACE FELL UPON THE FARM HOUSE FOR A FEW HOURS
EVEN IF I DON'T MEET THAT CONFOUNDED BEAST I WILL KEEP DASHING IN AND OUT OF THE WOODS AS WE GO
LOOKING AT HIS SCRATCHED HANDS AND RUBBING HIS HOT FACE IN GREAT DISCOMFORT FOR IT WAS THE GNAT THAT DROVE THE LION MAD YOU REMEMBER IT WAS EASY TO SAY I'LL FOLLOW THE BROOK BUT NOT SO EASY TO DO IT
TO THE GREAT CONTENTMENT OF THE GOOD PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND CORNY'S MOTHER WAS ONE OF THEM AND HER LAST WORDS WERE A PLEASANT DAY DEAR I WISH YOU'D LEAVE THAT GUN AT HOME I'M SO AFRAID YOU'LL GET HURT WITH IT NO FUN WITHOUT IT
AND I KNOW I CAN IF I ONCE GET A GOOD CHANCE MOTHER WON'T LET ME GO OFF FAR ENOUGH SO OF COURSE I DON'T DO IT AND THEN YOU ALL JEER AT ME TO MORROW WE ARE GOING UP THE MOUNTAIN AND I'M SET ON TRYING AGAIN
AND ALL THE REWARD OF HIS EAGER STRUGGLES WAS A SINGLE FEATHER THAT FLOATED DOWN AS THE GREAT BIRD SOARED SERENELY AWAY LEAVING THE BOY EXHAUSTED AND DISAPPOINTED IN A WILDERNESS OF GRANITE BOULDERS WITH NO SIGN OF A PATH TO SHOW THE WAY OUT
DISCOVERING NOW THE PERILS HE HAD BEEN TOO EAGER TO SEE BEFORE HE WAS A GOOD CLIMBER BUT WAS STIFF WITH WEARINESS AND HIS HANDS ALREADY SORE WITH SCRATCHES AND POISON SO HE WENT SLOWLY FEELING QUITE UNFIT FOR SUCH HARD WORK COMING TO THE RAVINE
CAME INTO HIS HEAD IF HE HAD NOT BEEN WEAK WITH HUNGER HE WOULD HAVE FELT BETTER ABLE TO BEAR IT BUT HIS LEGS TREMBLED UNDER HIM HIS HEAD ACHED WITH THE GLARE OF THE SUN AND A QUEER FAINTNESS CAME OVER HIM NOW AND THEN
BLISSFULLY DREAMING OF THE JOYS OF A HUNTER'S LIFE TILL A PECULIAR CRY STARTLED HIM TO HIS FEET AND SENT HIM CREEPING WARILY TOWARD THE SOUND WHETHER IT WAS A NEW KIND OF BIRD OR A FOX OR A BEAR HE DID NOT KNOW
NO DEACON COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SOBER HOWEVER THAN CHRIS WHEN THEY MET NEXT MORNING WHILE THE PARTY OF SUMMER BOARDERS AT THE OLD FARM HOUSE WERE IN A PLEASANT BUSTLE OF PREPARATION FOR THE LONG EXPECTED DAY ON THE MOUNTAIN
FOR ABNER SAYS THE BIG WOODS ARE THE PLACE TO FIND THE VARMINT NOW YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND LET ME SLIP AWAY WHEN I THINK WE'VE HIT THE RIGHT SPOT I'M NOT A BIT AFRAID AND WHILE THE REST GO POKING TO THE TOP I'LL PLUNGE INTO THE WOODS AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO
THE OTHER LAD APPEARED TO BE ABSORBED IN SHAPING AN ARROW FROM THE SLENDER STICK IN HIS HAND BUT HE WATCHED HIS NEIGHBOR WITH A GRIN SAYING A FEW WORDS OCCASIONALLY WHICH SEEMED TO ADD TO HIS IRRITATION THOUGH THEY WERE IN A SYMPATHIZING TONE OH WELL
CORNY TOOK AN OBSERVATION AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE RED LIGHT WAS FADING AND THE MIST RISING FROM THE VALLEY ALL HE COULD SEE WAS A NARROW LEDGE WHERE THE TREE STOOD AND ANXIOUS TO REACH A SAFER BED FOR THE NIGHT
AND WHEN THEY DO YOU JUST SAY OH HE'S ALL RIGHT HE'LL BE ALONG DIRECTLY AND GO AHEAD AND LET ME ALONE CORNY SPOKE SO CONFIDENTLY AND LOOKED SO PLEASED WITH HIS PLAN THAT HONEST CHRIS COULD NOT BEAR TO TELL HIM HOW MUCH DANGER HE WOULD RUN IN THAT PATHLESS FOREST
BUT THIS ONE IS NOT GOING TO FAIL IF I DIE FOR IT I FEEL THAT IT'S BEST TO TELL SOME ONE BECAUSE IT IS REALLY DANGEROUS AND IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME AS IS VERY LIKELY IT WOULD SAVE TIME AND TROUBLE
SO TIRED AND HUNGRY THAT HE HEARTILY WISHED HIMSELF BACK AMONG THE PARTY WHO HAD LUNCHED WELL AND WERE NOW PROBABLY DRIVING GAYLY HOMEWARD TO A GOOD SUPPER
ALL RIGHT BETTER TAKE OLD BUFF HE'LL BRING YOU HOME WHEN YOU GET LOST AND KEEP PUSS FROM CLAWING YOU YOU WON'T LIKE THAT PART OF THE FUN AS MUCH AS YOU EXPECT TO MAYBE SAID CHRIS WITH A SLY TWINKLE OF THE EYE
WAIT TILL I GET OUT MY HANDKERCHIEF IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE AFFECTIN I MAY WANT IT GRANITE'S CHEAP UP HERE JUST MENTION WHAT YOU'D LIKE ON YOUR TOMBSTONE AND I'LL SEE THAT IT'S DONE IF IT TAKES MY LAST CENT
AS HE OPENED HIS EYES AND SAW A BRILLIANT SKY ABOVE HIM ALL PURPLE GOLD AND RED HE SEEMED FLOATING IN THE AIR FOR HE SWAYED TO AND FRO ON A SOFT BED A PLEASANT MURMUR REACHED HIS EAR AND WHEN HE LOOKED DOWN HE SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE CLOUDS
SO DON'T WORRY NOT A WORD TO MOTHER MIND OR SHE WON'T LET ME GO
IN THIS WILD REGION WHERE THERE WAS NEITHER FOOD NOR SHELTER AND NIGHT COMING ON UTTERLY USED UP HE COULD NOT GET HOME NOW IF HE HAD KNOWN THE WAY AND SUDDENLY ALL THE TALES HE HAD EVER HEARD OF MEN LOST IN THE MOUNTAINS
WHERE OLDER HUNTERS THAN HE HAD BEEN LOST DON'T FEEL AS IF I CARED TO TELL ANY LIES ABOUT IT AND I DON'T ADVISE YOUR GOIN BUT IF YOU'RE MAD FOR CATAMOUNTS I S'POSE I MUST HUMOR YOU AND SAY NOTHING ONLY BEAR IN MIND
AND THERE ROLL UPON THE GRASS IN CONVULSIONS OF LAUGHTER
OR KNOCK OVER SOME HANDY BEAST FOR SUPPER HE SAID TALKING TO HIMSELF FOR COMPANY EVEN THE OLD CHAP LOST IN THE BUSH IN AUSTRALIA HAD A SAVAGE WITH HIM WHO DUG A HOLE IN A TREE AND PULLED OUT A NICE FAT WORM TO EAT
SO VIVID WAS IT THAT HE WOKE HIMSELF BY CRYING OUT HERE I AM AND NEARLY WENT OVER THE LEDGE STRETCHING OUT HIS ARMS TO ABNER THE START AND THE SCARE MADE IT HARD TO GO TO SLEEP AGAIN
WHO CARES FOR HUNGER AND MOSQUITO BITES NOT I HUNTERS CAN BEAR MORE THAN THAT I GUESS THE NEXT LIVE THING I SEE I'LL SHOOT IT AND MAKE A FIRE AND HAVE A JOLLY SUPPER NOW WHICH WAY WILL I GO UP OR DOWN
AND HERE AND THERE GREW A SPRIG OF CHECKERBERRY SOWN BY THE WIND SHELTERED BY THE TREE AND NOURISHED BY THE MOISTURE THAT TRICKLED DOWN THE ROCK FROM SOME HIDDEN SPRING EAGERLY CORNY ATE THE SWEET LEAVES TO STAY THE PANGS OF HUNGER THAT GNAWED HIM
THAT THE SLENDER CITY LAD COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AND WITH A SLAP THAT NEARLY SENT HIS NEIGHBOR OFF HIS PERCH CORNY SAID GOOD NATUREDLY COME NOW STOP JOKING AND LEND A HAND AND I'LL DO ANYTHING I CAN FOR YOU I'VE SET MY HEART ON SHOOTING A WILDCAT
HE FOUND THE ONLY ROAD WAS DOWN ITS PRECIPITOUS SIDE TO THE VALLEY THAT LOOKED SO SAFE AND PLEASANT NOW STUNTED PINES GREW IN THE FISSURES OF THE ROCKS AND THEIR STRONG ROOTS HELPED THE CLINGING HANDS AND FEET
HERE'S A NICE ROCK AND THE LAST SPRING WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE TILL WE GET TO THE TOP COME ON CHRIS AND GIVE US THE DIPPER MISSUS BARKER WANTS A DRINK AND SO DO I CALLED THE YOUNG HUNTER DRIVEN TO DESPAIR AT LAST UP CAME CHRIS AND WHILE HE RUMMAGED IN THE WELL PACKED BASKET
LUCKILY MY POWDER IS DRY AND MY GUN SAFE SO MY FUN ISN'T SPOILED THOUGH I DO LOOK LIKE A WALLOWING PIG I'VE HEARD OF MUD BATHS BUT I NEVER TOOK ONE BEFORE AND I'LL BE SHOT IF I DO AGAIN
A WOFUL SPECTACLE WAS THE TRIM LAD AS HE EMERGED FROM THE SLOUGH BLACK AND DRIPPING IN FRONT WELL SPATTERED BEHIND HATLESS AND ONE SHOE GONE HAVING BEEN CARELESSLY LEFT UNLACED IN THE ARDOR OF THE CHASE
AND VERY LIKELY A DAY OR SO TO SPEND HERE TILL I'M FOUND IF I EVER AM CHRIS SAID YELL IF YOU WANT US MUCH GOOD THAT WOULD DO NOW I'LL TRY THOUGH AND GETTING UP ON HIS WEARY LEGS CORNY SHOUTED TILL HE WAS HOARSE
LET HIM LAUGH IT WILL BE MY TURN WHEN I GO HOME WITH A FINE CAT OVER MY SHOULDER THOUGHT CORNY TEARING ALONG HEEDLESS OF FALLS SCRATCHES AND BRUISED KNEES AT LENGTH HE PAUSED FOR BREATH AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM WELL SATISFIED
IF A CHAP CAN'T DO A THING HE CAN'T AND HE'D BETTER GIVE UP AND SAY BEAT BUT I WON'T GIVE UP AND I NEVER SAY BEAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE LAUGHED OUT OF IT AND I'LL DO WHAT I SAID I WOULD IF IT TAKES ALL SUMMER CHRIS WARNER
SOMEWHERE ROUND THAT WAY I CAN TRY FOR IT AND PERHAPS SHOOT SOMETHING ON THE WAY MAY BREAK MY BONES BUT I CAN'T SIT AND STARVE UP HERE AND I WAS A FOOL TO COME I'LL KEEP THE FEATHER ANYWAY TO PROVE THAT I REALLY SAW AN EAGLE THAT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING
DON'T SEEM TO FEEL ANXIOUS A MITE BUT I'LL STAND READY TO PICK UP THE PIECES IF YOU COME TO GRIEF NOW CHRIS IT'S MEAN OF YOU TO KEEP ON MAKING FUN WHEN I'M IN DEAD EARNEST AND THIS MAY BE THE LAST THING YOU CAN DO FOR ME
HE CLIMBED CAUTIOUSLY DOWN TO DROP ON THE ROCK SO FULL OF GRATITUDE FOR SAFETY THAT HE COULD ONLY LIE QUITE STILL FOR A LITTLE WHILE THINKING OF MOTHER AND TRYING NOT TO CRY
BUT ECHO ALONE ANSWERED HIM AND AFTER A FEW EFFORTS HE GAVE IT UP TRYING TO ACCEPT THE SITUATION LIKE A MAN AS IF KIND NATURE TOOK PITY ON THE POOR BOY THE LITTLE LEDGE WAS SOFT WITH LICHENS AND THIN GRASS
THREE MERRY GIRLS A PAIR OF SMALL BOYS TWO AMIABLE MAMMAS CHRIS AND CORNY MADE UP THE PARTY WITH ABNER TO DRIVE THE BIG WAGON DRAWN BY MILK AND MOLASSES THE YELLOW SPAN ALL ABOARD SHOUTED OUR YOUNG NIMROD
AND NEAR THE CENTRE ABOUT FIFTY STADIA FROM THE PLAIN
EIGHT THE INDULGENCE OF THE PREJUDICE AGAINST SAILING BEYOND THE COLUMNS AND THE POPULAR BELIEF OF THE SHALLOWNESS OF THE OCEAN IN THAT PART NINE
AND VARIETY OF COLOURS SEEMED ALSO TO BE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF GREEK NOTIONS IN THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS PLATO IS DESCRIBING A SORT OF BABYLONIAN OR EGYPTIAN CITY TO WHICH HE OPPOSES THE FRUGAL LIFE OF THE TRUE
BECAUSE HE HAS TO SPEAK OF MEN WHOM WE KNOW AND NOT OF GODS WHOM WE DO NOT KNOW SOCRATES READILY GRANTS HIS REQUEST AND ANTICIPATING THAT HERMOCRATES WILL MAKE A SIMILAR PETITION
OR FROM A SENSE OF THE ARTISTIC DIFFICULTY OF THE DESIGN
IN MODERN TIMES WE HARDLY SEEK FOR TRACES OF THE SUBMERGED CONTINENT BUT EVEN MISTER GROTE IS INCLINED TO BELIEVE IN THE EGYPTIAN POEM OF SOLON OF WHICH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN ANTIQUITY
THE SIDE OF THE HILL WAS INHABITED BY CRAFTSMEN AND HUSBANDMEN AND THE WARRIORS DWELT BY THEMSELVES ON THE SUMMIT AROUND THE TEMPLES OF HEPHAESTUS AND ATHENE IN AN ENCLOSURE WHICH WAS LIKE THE GARDEN OF A SINGLE HOUSE
ATTICA IN THOSE DAYS EXTENDED SOUTHWARDS TO THE ISTHMUS AND INLAND TO THE HEIGHTS OF PARNES AND CITHAERON AND BETWEEN THEM AND THE SEA INCLUDED THE DISTRICT OF OROPUS
THAT HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH WHICH MYTHOLOGY HAD CORRUPTED THE WORLD LIKE A CHILD HAS READILY AND FOR THE MOST PART UNHESITATINGLY ACCEPTED THE TALE OF THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS
TIMAEUS CONCLUDES WITH A PRAYER THAT HIS WORDS MAY BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE GOD WHOM HE HAS REVEALED AND CRITIAS WHOSE TURN FOLLOWS BEGS THAT A LARGER MEASURE OF INDULGENCE MAY BE CONCEDED TO HIM
UNLESS HE HAD THE ASSENT OF THE MAJORITY FOR MANY GENERATIONS AS TRADITION TELLS THE PEOPLE OF ATLANTIS WERE OBEDIENT TO THE LAWS AND TO THE GODS AND PRACTISED GENTLENESS AND WISDOM IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH ONE ANOTHER
FOR THERE HAVE SINCE BEEN MANY DELUGES AND THE REMNANT WHO SURVIVED IN THE MOUNTAINS WERE IGNORANT OF THE ART OF WRITING AND DURING MANY GENERATIONS WERE WHOLLY DEVOTED TO ACQUIRING THE MEANS OF LIFE
ALSO THERE WERE FOUNTAINS OF HOT AND COLD WATER AND SUITABLE BUILDINGS SURROUNDING THEM AND TREES AND THERE WERE BATHS BOTH OF THE KINGS AND OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AND SEPARATE BATHS FOR WOMEN AND ALSO FOR CATTLE
AND SURROUNDED BY AN ENCLOSURE OF GOLD AND THERE WAS POSEIDON'S OWN TEMPLE WHICH WAS COVERED WITH SILVER AND THE PINNACLES WITH GOLD THE ROOF WAS OF IVORY ADORNED WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND ORICHALCUM
THE WATER FROM THE BATHS WAS CARRIED TO THE GROVE OF POSEIDON AND BY AQUEDUCTS OVER THE BRIDGES TO THE OUTER CIRCLES AND THERE WERE TEMPLES IN THE ZONES AND IN THE LARGER OF THE TWO THERE WAS A RACECOURSE FOR HORSES
AND TREES BEARING FRUIT THESE THEY USED AND EMPLOYED THEMSELVES IN CONSTRUCTING THEIR TEMPLES AND PALACES AND HARBOURS AND DOCKS IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER FIRST THEY BRIDGED OVER THE ZONES OF SEA AND MADE A WAY TO AND FROM THE ROYAL PALACE
AND IS NOW IN MY POSSESSION IN THE DIVISION OF THE EARTH POSEIDON OBTAINED AS HIS PORTION THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS AND THERE HE BEGAT CHILDREN WHOSE MOTHER WAS A MORTAL TOWARDS THE SEA AND IN THE CENTRE OF THE ISLAND THERE WAS A VERY FAIR AND FERTILE PLAIN
THE COUNTRY WAS THEN AS WHAT REMAINS OF IT STILL IS THE MOST FERTILE IN THE WORLD AND ABOUNDED IN RICH PLAINS AND PASTURES BUT IN THE COURSE OF AGES MUCH OF THE SOIL WAS WASHED AWAY AND DISAPPEARED IN THE DEEP SEA
SUCH AS THE GREEKS BELIEVED TO HAVE EXISTED UNDER THE SWAY OF THE FIRST PERSIAN KINGS BUT ALL SUCH EMPIRES WERE LIABLE TO DEGENERATE AND SOON INCURRED THE ANGER OF THE GODS THEIR ORIENTAL WEALTH AND SPLENDOUR OF GOLD AND SILVER
AND NOW I WILL SPEAK TO YOU OF THEIR ADVERSARIES BUT FIRST I OUGHT TO EXPLAIN THAT THE GREEK NAMES WERE GIVEN TO SOLON IN AN EGYPTIAN FORM AND HE ENQUIRED THEIR MEANING AND TRANSLATED THEM
THREE JAVELIN MEN AND FOUR SAILORS TO MAKE UP THE COMPLEMENT OF TWELVE HUNDRED SHIPS EACH OF THE TEN KINGS WAS ABSOLUTE IN HIS OWN CITY AND KINGDOM THE RELATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS TO ONE ANOTHER WERE DETERMINED BY THE INJUNCTIONS OF POSEIDON
OF THE AENEID IS INTENDED BY VIRGIL TO FORESHADOW THE WARS OF CARTHAGE AND ROME THE SMALL NUMBER OF THE PRIMITIVE ATHENIAN CITIZENS TWENTY THOUSAND WHICH IS ABOUT THEIR PRESENT NUMBER
FOUND NO DIFFICULTY IN CONTRIVING THE WATER SUPPLY OF THE CENTRE ISLAND TEN THE MENTION OF THE OLD RIVALRY OF POSEIDON AND ATHENE AND THE CREATION OF THE FIRST INHABITANTS OUT OF THE SOIL PLATO HERE AS ELSEWHERE
WHILE OTHERS LIKE MARTIN DISCUSS THE EGYPTIAN ORIGIN OF THE LEGEND OR LIKE M DE HUMBOLDT WHOM HE QUOTES ARE DISPOSED TO FIND IN IT A VESTIGE OF A WIDELY SPREAD TRADITION
YET WE KNOW THAT HIS CHARACTER WAS ACCOUNTED INFAMOUS BY XENOPHON AND THAT THE MERE ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM WAS MADE A SUBJECT OF ACCUSATION AGAINST SOCRATES WE CAN ONLY INFER THAT IN THIS AND PERHAPS IN SOME OTHER CASES
HELLENIC CITIZEN IT IS REMARKABLE THAT IN HIS BRIEF SKETCH OF THEM HE IDEALIZES THE HUSBANDMEN WHO ARE LOVERS OF HONOUR AND TRUE HUSBANDMEN AS WELL AS THE WARRIORS WHO ARE HIS SOLE CONCERN IN THE REPUBLIC
THE MANNER IN WHICH TRADITIONAL NAMES AND INDICATIONS OF GEOGRAPHY ARE INTERMINGLED WHY HERE BE TRUTHS
THEY WERE NOT TO TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND WERE TO COME TO THE RESCUE IF ANY OF THEIR BRETHREN WERE ATTACKED THEY WERE TO DELIBERATE IN COMMON ABOUT WAR AND THE KING WAS NOT TO HAVE THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH OVER HIS KINSMEN
THE CONFESSION THAT THE DEPTH OF THE DITCH IN THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS WAS NOT TO BE BELIEVED AND YET HE COULD ONLY REPEAT WHAT HE HAD HEARD COMPARED WITH THE STATEMENT MADE IN AN EARLIER PASSAGE THAT POSEIDON BEING A GOD
SOME OF THEIR NAMES SUCH AS CECROPS ERECHTHEUS ERICHTHONIUS AND ERYSICHTHON WERE PRESERVED AND ADOPTED IN LATER TIMES BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR DEEDS HAS PASSED AWAY
INTENDED TO REPRESENT THE IDEAL STATE ENGAGED IN A PATRIOTIC CONFLICT THIS MYTHICAL CONFLICT IS PROPHETIC OR SYMBOLICAL OF THE STRUGGLE OF ATHENS AND PERSIA
AND WHERE FALLING OUT OF THE STRAIGHT LINE FOLLOWED THE CIRCULAR DITCH WHICH WAS OF AN INCREDIBLE DEPTH THIS DEPTH RECEIVED THE STREAMS WHICH CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS AS WELL AS THE CANALS OF THE INTERIOR AND FOUND A WAY TO THE SEA
HENCE WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT THE ENTIRE NARRATIVE IS DUE TO THE IMAGINATION OF PLATO WHO HAS USED THE NAME OF SOLON AND INTRODUCED THE EGYPTIAN PRIESTS TO GIVE VERISIMILITUDE TO HIS STORY
THERE WERE VARIOUS CLASSES OF CITIZENS INCLUDING HANDICRAFTSMEN AND HUSBANDMEN AND A SUPERIOR CLASS OF WARRIORS WHO DWELT APART AND WERE EDUCATED AND HAD ALL THINGS IN COMMON LIKE OUR GUARDIANS
PERHAPS IN SOME DEGREE ALSO OF THE WARS OF THE GREEKS AND CARTHAGINIANS IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE PERSIAN IS PREFIGURED BY THE TROJAN WAR TO THE MIND OF HERODOTUS OR AS THE NARRATIVE OF THE FIRST PART
NATURAL PHILOSOPHER OF MODERN TIMES ARE NOT WHOLLY EMANCIPATED ALTHOUGH WORTHLESS IN RESPECT OF ANY RESULT WHICH CAN BE ATTAINED BY THEM DISCUSSIONS LIKE THOSE OF M MARTIN
AND SUPPLIED THE LAND WITH ALL THINGS NEEDED FOR THE LIFE OF MAN HERE HE BEGAT A FAMILY CONSISTING OF FIVE PAIRS OF TWIN MALE CHILDREN THE ELDEST WAS ATLAS AND HIM HE MADE KING OF THE CENTRE ISLAND WHILE TO HIS TWIN BROTHER
THEY KNEW THAT THEY COULD ONLY HAVE THE TRUE USE OF RICHES BY NOT CARING ABOUT THEM BUT GRADUALLY THE DIVINE PORTION OF THEIR SOULS BECAME DILUTED WITH TOO MUCH OF THE MORTAL ADMIXTURE AND THEY BEGAN TO DEGENERATE
AROUND THE TEMPLE RANGED THE BULLS OF POSEIDON ONE OF WHICH THE TEN KINGS CAUGHT AND SACRIFICED SHEDDING THE BLOOD OF THE VICTIM OVER THE INSCRIPTION
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED INTO SIXTY THOUSAND LOTS EACH OF WHICH WAS A SQUARE OF TEN STADIA AND THE OWNER OF A LOT WAS BOUND TO FURNISH THE SIXTH PART OF A WAR CHARIOT SO AS TO MAKE UP TEN THOUSAND CHARIOTS
WHICH GAVE AN ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF COOL WATER IN SUMMER AND WARM IN WINTER OF THIS THERE ARE STILL SOME TRACES THEY WERE CAREFUL TO PRESERVE THE NUMBER OF FIGHTING MEN AND WOMEN AT TWENTY THOUSAND WHICH IS EQUAL TO THAT OF THE PRESENT MILITARY FORCE
AND SO THEY PASSED THEIR LIVES AS GUARDIANS OF THE CITIZENS AND LEADERS OF THE HELLENES THEY WERE A JUST AND FAMOUS RACE CELEBRATED FOR THEIR BEAUTY AND VIRTUE ALL OVER EUROPE AND ASIA
THE SECOND WITH TIN AND THE THIRD WHICH WAS THE WALL OF THE CITADEL FLASHED WITH THE RED LIGHT OF ORICHALCUM IN THE INTERIOR OF THE CITADEL WAS A HOLY TEMPLE DEDICATED TO CLEITO AND POSEIDON
THE VARIOUS TRIBES OF GREEKS AND BARBARIANS WHO TOOK PART IN THE WAR WILL BE DEALT WITH AS THEY SUCCESSIVELY APPEAR ON THE SCENE IN THE BEGINNING THE GODS AGREED TO DIVIDE THE EARTH BY LOT IN A FRIENDLY MANNER
AND VOWING NOT TO TRANSGRESS THE LAWS OF THEIR FATHER POSEIDON WHEN NIGHT CAME THEY PUT ON AZURE ROBES AND GAVE JUDGMENT AGAINST OFFENDERS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THEIR LAWS RELATED TO THEIR DEALINGS WITH ONE ANOTHER
HAD BROUGHT DOWN THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD TO THE CREATION OF MAN AND THE DAWN OF HISTORY WAS NOW TO SUCCEED THE PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE
WHICH HAD BEEN INSCRIBED BY THE FIRST KINGS ON A COLUMN OF ORICHALCUM IN THE TEMPLE OF POSEIDON AT WHICH THE KINGS AND PRINCES GATHERED TOGETHER AND HELD A FESTIVAL EVERY FIFTH AND EVERY SIXTH YEAR ALTERNATELY
IN WINTER THEY RETIRED INTO HOUSES ON THE NORTH OF THE HILL
AND THE REST OF THE INTERIOR WAS LINED WITH ORICHALCUM WITHIN WAS AN IMAGE OF THE GOD STANDING IN A CHARIOT DRAWN BY SIX WINGED HORSES AND TOUCHING THE ROOF WITH HIS HEAD AROUND HIM WERE A HUNDRED NEREIDS RIDING ON DOLPHINS
BLACK AND WHITE AND RED WHICH THEY SOMETIMES INTERMINGLED FOR THE SAKE OF ORNAMENT AND AS THEY QUARRIED THEY HOLLOWED OUT BENEATH THE EDGES OF THE ZONES DOUBLE DOCKS HAVING ROOFS OF ROCK THE OUTERMOST OF THE WALLS WAS COATED WITH BRASS
AND THE ARMED IMAGE OF THE GODDESS WHICH WAS DEDICATED BY THE ANCIENT ATHENIANS IS AN EVIDENCE TO OTHER AGES THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAD IN THOSE DAYS AS THEY OUGHT ALWAYS TO HAVE COMMON VIRTUES AND PURSUITS
AND THEIR DAUGHTER CLEITO OF WHOM POSEIDON BECAME ENAMOURED HE TO SECURE HIS LOVE ENCLOSED THE MOUNTAIN WITH RINGS OR ZONES VARYING IN SIZE TWO OF LAND AND THREE OF SEA
THE INGENIOUS REASON ASSIGNED FOR THE GREEK NAMES OCCURRING IN THE EGYPTIAN TALE FIVE THE REMARK THAT THE ARMED STATUE OF ATHENA INDICATED THE COMMON WARRIOR LIFE OF MEN AND WOMEN
EXTENDS BY ANTICIPATION A LIKE INDULGENCE TO HIM CRITIAS RETURNS TO HIS STORY PROFESSING ONLY TO REPEAT WHAT SOLON WAS TOLD BY THE PRIESTS THE WAR OF WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK HAD OCCURRED NINE THOUSAND YEARS AGO
AND THAT THOUGH HE SPEAKS OF THE COMMON PURSUITS OF MEN AND WOMEN HE SAYS NOTHING OF THE COMMUNITY OF WIVES AND CHILDREN IT IS SINGULAR THAT PLATO SHOULD HAVE PREFIXED THE MOST DETESTED OF ATHENIAN NAMES TO THIS DIALOGUE
ONE OF THE COMBATANTS WAS THE CITY OF ATHENS THE OTHER WAS THE GREAT ISLAND OF ATLANTIS CRITIAS PROPOSES TO SPEAK OF THESE RIVAL POWERS FIRST OF ALL GIVING TO ATHENS THE PRECEDENCE
TWO HORSES AND RIDERS UPON THEM A PAIR OF CHARIOT HORSES WITHOUT A SEAT AND AN ATTENDANT AND CHARIOTEER TWO HOPLITES TWO ARCHERS TWO SLINGERS THREE STONE SHOOTERS
OUTSIDE THE TEMPLE WERE PLACED GOLDEN STATUES OF ALL THE DESCENDANTS OF THE TEN KINGS AND OF THEIR WIVES THERE WAS AN ALTAR TOO AND THERE WERE PALACES CORRESPONDING TO THE GREATNESS AND GLORY BOTH OF THE KINGDOM AND OF THE TEMPLE
THESE WERE MODEST DWELLINGS WHICH THEY BEQUEATHED UNALTERED TO THEIR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN IN SUMMER TIME THE SOUTH SIDE WAS INHABITED BY THEM AND THEN THEY LEFT THEIR GARDENS AND DINING HALLS IN THE MIDST OF THE ACROPOLIS WAS A FOUNTAIN
NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN PLATO HOW TO INVENT A NOBLE LIE OBSERVE ONE THE INNOCENT DECLARATION OF SOCRATES THAT THE TRUTH OF THE STORY IS A GREAT ADVANTAGE TWO
AND WAS CROWDED WITH DWELLINGS AND THE HARBOUR AND CANAL RESOUNDED WITH THE DIN OF HUMAN VOICES THE PLAIN AROUND THE CITY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED AND SHELTERED FROM THE NORTH BY MOUNTAINS IT WAS OBLONG
CRITIAS IS A FRAGMENT WHICH BREAKS OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE THE SECOND PART OF A TRILOGY WHICH LIKE THE OTHER GREAT PLATONIC TRILOGY OF THE SOPHIST STATESMAN PHILOSOPHER WAS NEVER COMPLETED
PLATO'S CHARACTERS HAVE NO REFERENCE TO THE ACTUAL FACTS THE DESIRE TO DO HONOUR TO HIS OWN FAMILY AND THE CONNECTION WITH SOLON MAY HAVE SUGGESTED THE INTRODUCTION OF HIS NAME WHY THE CRITIAS WAS NEVER COMPLETED WHETHER FROM ACCIDENT
OF A STILL GREATER ISLAND THE CONTINENT OF AMERICA THE TALE SAYS M MARTIN RESTS UPON THE AUTHORITY OF THE EGYPTIAN PRIESTS AND THE EGYPTIAN PRIESTS
OF THE ATLANTIC HOSTS THE PASSING REMARK IN THE TIMAEUS THAT ATHENS WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE STRUGGLE IN WHICH SHE CONQUERED AND BECAME THE LIBERATOR OF GREECE IS ALSO AN ALLUSION TO THE LATER HISTORY
BY PLATO TRANSLATED BY BENJAMIN JOWETT
THOUGH TO THE OUTWARD EYE THEY APPEARED GLORIOUS AS EVER AT THE VERY TIME WHEN THEY WERE FILLED WITH ALL INIQUITY THE ALL SEEING ZEUS
WITH THE BARBARIC GREATNESS OF THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS PLATO PROBABLY INTENDED TO SHOW THAT A STATE SUCH AS THE IDEAL ATHENS WAS INVINCIBLE THOUGH MATCHED AGAINST ANY NUMBER OF OPPONENTS
SIX THE PARTICULARITY WITH WHICH THE THIRD DELUGE BEFORE THAT OF DEUCALION IS AFFIRMED TO HAVE BEEN THE GREAT DESTRUCTION SEVEN THE HAPPY GUESS THAT GREAT GEOLOGICAL CHANGES HAVE BEEN EFFECTED BY WATER
AS SHOWING HOW THE CHANCE WORD OF SOME POET OR PHILOSOPHER HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO ENDLESS RELIGIOUS OR HISTORICAL ENQUIRIES
PLATO AS HE HAS ALREADY TOLD US
TO THE GREEK SUCH A TALE LIKE THAT OF THE EARTH BORN MEN WOULD HAVE SEEMED PERFECTLY ACCORDANT WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS MYTHOLOGY AND NOT MORE MARVELLOUS THAN THE WONDERS OF THE EAST NARRATED BY HERODOTUS AND OTHERS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DECEIVED INTO BELIEVING IT
AND THE INHABITANTS OF THIS FAIR LAND WERE ENDOWED WITH INTELLIGENCE AND THE LOVE OF BEAUTY THE ACROPOLIS OF THE ANCIENT ATHENS EXTENDED TO THE ILISSUS AND ERIDANUS
EUMELUS OR GADEIRUS HE ASSIGNED THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY WHICH WAS NEAREST THE STRAITS THE OTHER BROTHERS HE MADE CHIEFS OVER THE REST OF THE ISLAND AND THEIR KINGDOM EXTENDED AS FAR AS EGYPT AND TYRRHENIA
AND WHEN THEY HAD MADE THE ALLOTMENT THEY SETTLED THEIR SEVERAL COUNTRIES AND WERE THE SHEPHERDS OR RATHER THE PILOTS OF MANKIND WHOM THEY GUIDED BY PERSUASION AND NOT BY FORCE HEPHAESTUS AND ATHENA BROTHER AND SISTER DEITIES
TOOK A PLEASURE IN DECEIVING THE GREEKS HE NEVER APPEARS TO SUSPECT THAT THERE IS A GREATER DECEIVER OR MAGICIAN THAN THE EGYPTIAN PRIESTS THAT IS TO SAY PLATO HIMSELF FROM THE DOMINION OF WHOSE GENIUS THE CRITIC AND
WHICH HIS DIVINE POWER READILY ENABLED HIM TO EXCAVATE AND FASHION AND AS THERE WAS NO SHIPPING IN THOSE DAYS NO MAN COULD GET INTO THE PLACE TO THE INTERIOR ISLAND HE CONVEYED UNDER THE EARTH SPRINGS OF WATER HOT AND COLD
WHICH THEY BUILT IN THE CENTRE ISLAND THIS ANCIENT PALACE WAS ORNAMENTED BY SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS AND THEY DUG A CANAL WHICH PASSED THROUGH THE ZONES OF LAND FROM THE ISLAND TO THE SEA
AND WITHOUT A SUSPICION THAT THE WHOLE NARRATIVE IS A FABRICATION INTERPRETERS HAVE LOOKED FOR THE SPOT IN EVERY PART OF THE GLOBE AMERICA ARABIA FELIX CEYLON PALESTINE SARDINIA SWEDEN
BUT IT APPEARS STRANGE THAT LATER AGES SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSED UPON BY THE FICTION AS MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO FIND THE GREAT ISLAND OF ATLANTIS AS TO DISCOVER THE COUNTRY OF THE LOST TRIBES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DESCRIPTION OF PLATO
WHICH RAN ALL ROUND THE ISLAND THE GUARDS WERE DISTRIBUTED IN THE ZONES ACCORDING TO THE TRUST REPOSED IN THEM THE MOST TRUSTED OF THEM WERE STATIONED IN THE CITADEL THE DOCKS WERE FULL OF TRIREMES AND STORES
NOW ATLAS HAD A FAIR POSTERITY AND GREAT TREASURES DERIVED FROM MINES AMONG THEM THAT PRECIOUS METAL ORICHALCUM AND THERE WAS ABUNDANCE OF WOOD AND HERDS OF ELEPHANTS AND PASTURES FOR ANIMALS OF ALL KINDS
IN MIND AND ART UNITED OBTAINED AS THEIR LOT THE LAND OF ATTICA A LAND SUITED TO THE GROWTH OF VIRTUE AND WISDOM AND THERE THEY SETTLED A BRAVE RACE OF CHILDREN OF THE SOIL AND TAUGHT THEM HOW TO ORDER THE STATE
SHE MOVED HEAVILY ON HER STICKS JULIE STOOD ASIDE TO LET HER PASS ONE OF THE STICKS SLIPPED A LITTLE ON THE POLISHED FLOOR JULIE WITH A CRY RAN FORWARD BUT LADY HENRY FIERCELY MOTIONED HER ASIDE
WE MEANT NO HARM SHE SAID COLDLY IT ALL CAME ABOUT VERY SIMPLY A FEW PEOPLE CAME IN TO INQUIRE AFTER YOU I REGRET THEY SHOULD HAVE STAYED TALKING SO LONG
THE FRENCHMAN FEELING HIMSELF AMONG COMRADES WORTHY OF HIS STEEL
MEREDITH THE FRENCHMAN WARKWORTH AND GENERAL FERGUS WERE DISCUSSING A GRAND REVIEW WHICH HAD BEEN HELD THE DAY BEFORE DELAFIELD HAD MOVED ROUND TO THE BACK OF JULIE'S CHAIR AND SHE WAS TALKING TO HIM
SHE WALKED TOWARDS THE FIREPLACE RECOVERED HER GLOVES AND HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WERE ON THE MANTEL PIECE AND THEN TURNED SLOWLY TO LADY HENRY I HAVE DONE NOTHING IN YOUR SERVICE THAT I AM ASHAMED OF ON THE CONTRARY
SAID JULIE IN A VOICE THAT PIERCED I WAS ALONE POOR WORSE THAN MOTHERLESS YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE WHAT YOU WOULD WITH ME A LITTLE INDULGENCE AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR DEVOTED SLAVE BUT YOU CHOSE TO HUMILIATE AND CRUSH ME
WHEN MISS LE BRETON REACHED THE HALL A FOOTMAN WAS AT THE OUTER DOOR RECITING LADY HENRY'S EXCUSES AS EACH FRESH CARRIAGE DROVE UP WHILE IN THE INNER VESTIBULE WHICH WAS WELL SCREENED FROM THE VIEW OF THE STREET
IS IT A PARTY WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE MEREDITH
TO DU BARTAS WITH A GRIN THE FRENCHMAN'S EYES WERE ROUND WITH ASTONISHMENT
I WISH YOU WOULD CONFIDE IN ME SAID HE FREDERICK DID NOT ANSWER THE HANDS OF THE CLOCK WERE MOVING ON I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT FOR
I FEAR I CANNOT ASK YOU TO REMAIN WITH ME LONGER THE HOUR IS LATE AND I AM AS YOU SEE INDISPOSED BUT I TRUST ON SOME FUTURE OCCASION I MAY HAVE THE HONOR
DEAR LADY HENRY GO SHE SAID UNDER HER BREATH LOOKING HIM IN THE EYES AND HE TURNED AND WENT WITHOUT A WORD SO DID THE DUCHESS WHIMPERING HER HAND IN DELAFIELD'S ARM AS SHE PASSED JULIE WHO STOOD
ON THE BANISTER OF THE STAIRS AGAINST WHICH SHE WAS LEANING AND BROKE INTO STIFLED SOBS
MISTER SUTHERLAND WAS BUSILY ENGAGED WITH A LAW PAPER WHEN HIS SON ENTERED HIS PRESENCE
AND MONTRESOR BROKE IN FROM TIME TO TIME
AND JACOB THE DIRECTOR OF THE FRENCH FOREIGN OFFICE SAID MONTRESOR IN AN ASIDE TO THE DUCHESS
I AM CHARMED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOUR LEAVE I WILL PURSUE IT WHEN I AM BETTER ABLE TO PROFIT BY IT TO MORROW I WILL WRITE TO YOU TO PROPOSE ANOTHER MEETING SHOULD MY HEALTH ALLOW
YET THE WORDS WERE EMPHATIC ENOUGH MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU JACOB
TO GIVE MY SERVANTS YOUR ORDERS JULIE STOOD STONILY ERECT
HE TOO BEGAN TO TALK FRENCH AND SOON
JACOB DELAFIELD HELD HER HAND CLOSE IN HIS AND WHEN AT LAST THE SOUNDS HAD DIED IN THE DISTANCE HE LIFTED IT TO HIS LIPS YOU KNOW THAT I AM YOUR FRIEND AND SERVANT HE SAID IN A QUEER MUFFLED VOICE YOU PROMISED I SHOULD BE
THESE ENGLISHWOMEN OVERDO THEIR JEWELS HE THOUGHT WITH DISTASTE BUT THEY OVERDO EVERYTHING THAT IS A HANDSOME FELLOW BY THE WAY WHO WAS WITH LA PETITE FEE WHEN WE ARRIVED
AS HIS EYE FELL ON THE PAPER FLUTTERING IN THE OTHER'S HAND I EXPECTED MONEY NOT PAPER THE PAPER IS GOOD
AS YOU SEE SHE POINTED TO THE STICKS WHICH SUPPORTED HER I HAVE NO HANDS TO NIGHT MY INFIRMITIES HAVE NEED OF THEM MONTRESOR APPROACHED HER AGAIN
WHISPERED RAPTUROUSLY IN HIS EAR ISN'T SHE ENCHANTING JULIE TO NIGHT THAT GENTLEMAN MADE NO ANSWER THE DUCHESS REMEMBERING SHRANK BACK AND SPOKE NO MORE
JULIE LE BRETON CAUGHT THE CHAIR BEHIND HER AND DELAFIELD SAW HER TURN PALE BUT BEFORE SHE OR HE COULD SPEAK AGAIN THE DOOR OF THE LIBRARY WAS THROWN OPEN GOOD HEAVENS SAID MONTRESOR SPRINGING TO HIS FEET
WHEN ELEMENTS OF DANGER AND OF DOUBT ABOUNDED AND NONE KNEW WHAT A MONTH MIGHT BRING FORTH WITH PERFECT TACT JULIE GUIDED THE CONVERSATION SO THAT ALL DIFFICULTIES WHETHER FOR THE FRENCH OFFICIAL OR THE ENGLISH STATESMAN
I WILL SOON PROVE ITS VALUE IN YOUR EYES FOLLOW ME UP STAIRS TO MY FATHER HIS ENERGY THE ENERGY OF DESPAIR NO DOUBT SEEMED TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON THE OTHER
AND HIS SHREWD SMALL EYES TRAVELLED FROM WARKWORTH TO THE DUCHESS HIS MIND THE WHILE INSTINCTIVELY ASSUMING SOME HIDDEN RELATION BETWEEN THEM
RELAXED COURTEOUS KIND TRUSTING HIS COMPANIONS SIMPLY AS IT WAS HIS INSTINCT TO TRUST ALL WOMEN JULIE'S HEART BEAT FAST WHAT AN EXCITING WHAT AN IMPORTANT EVENING
THOUGH NEVER BEYOND THE POINT OF GRACE THE POINT OF DELICATE ADJUSTMENT TO THE TALKERS ROUND HER SO THAT PRESENTLY AND BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS SHE WAS THE QUEEN OF THE ROOM THE DUCHESS IN ECSTASY PINCHED JACOB DELAFIELD'S WRIST
SHE CAME FORWARD AND IN A FRENCH WHICH WAS A JOY TO THE EAR
I WISHED TO SEE THE DUCHESS IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO PREVARICATE THE DUCHESS WAS NOT YOUR FIRST VISITOR JULIE FLUSHED CAPTAIN WARKWORTH ARRIVED FIRST THAT WAS A MERE CHANCE
SAID JULIE IN A SOFT LOWERED VOICE BUT I AM SURE SHE WOULD LIKE ME TO GIVE YOU HER MESSAGE AND TO TELL YOU HOW SHE IS SHE WOULD NOT LIKE HER OLD FRIENDS TO BE ALARMED WOULD YOU COME IN FOR A MOMENT THERE IS A FIRE IN THE LIBRARY
HE THREW UP HIS HANDS IN RELIEF I BREATHE AGAIN HE SAID GREETING HER WITH EFFUSION DUCHESS WHERE THOU GOEST I MAY GO BUT I FEEL LIKE A BOY ROBBING A HEN ROOST LET ME INTRODUCE MY FRIEND GENERAL FERGUS
WHICH GO TO MAKE CONVERSATION AND IN FIVE MINUTES MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON WAS LEADING IT AS USUAL A BRILLIANT FRENCH BOOK HAD RECENTLY APPEARED DEALING WITH CERTAIN POINTS OF THE EGYPTIAN QUESTION IN A MANNER SO INTERESTING
LADY HENRY MOTIONED TOWARDS THE DOOR JACOB HESITATED THEN QUIETLY TOOK HIS DEPARTURE HE THREW JULIE A LOOK OF ANXIOUS APPEAL AS HE WENT OUT BUT SHE DID NOT SEE IT
AND HER BRAIN WAS PUZZLING AS TO HOW SHE WAS TO SECURE THE FIVE MINUTES TALK
I AM IN SERIOUS AND IMMEDIATE NEED OF NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS I WANT IT SO MUCH
DON'T TOUCH ME DON'T COME NEAR ME SHE PAUSED
WITH A STRONG MOUTH SLIGHTLY UNDERHUNG AND A DOGGED CHIN THE WHOLE LIT BY EYES THAT WERE THE CHOSEN HOMES OF TRUTH HUMANITY AND WILL PRESENTLY SHE DISCOVERED AS THEY DREW THEIR CHAIRS A LITTLE BACK FROM THE CIRCLE THAT SHE TOO
GO TO THE DUCHESS TO MORROW MORNING AS SOON AS YOU CAN GET AWAY SHE TOLD ME TO SAY THAT HUTTON GAVE ME A LITTLE NOTE FROM HER
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL YOU GROANED THE YOUNG MAN STARTING AS HE HEARD A STEP ON THE WALK WITHOUT YOUR NEED HAS BECOME STRANGELY IMPERATIVE PROCEEDED THE OTHER
SO HE GAVE THE CONVERSATION A TURN AND MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON TOOK THE HINT AT ONCE
THE SOCIAL COMEDY WAS BEING PLAYED AT ITS BEST BUT HERE SURELY WAS TRAGEDY OR FATE WHO WAS SHE WHAT DID IT MEAN THE DUCHESS RUSHED TO HER AND FELL OF COURSE UPON THE ONE THING SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID
RELINQUISHED THE HALF DISDAINFUL RESERVE WITH WHICH HE HAD ENTERED AND TOOK PAINS HE DREW THE MAN IN QUESTION EN SILHOUETTE WITH A HOSTILE TOUCH SO SURE AN IRONY SO LIGHT THAT HIS SUCCESS WAS INSTANT AND GREAT
WHICH JARRED WITH THE GENERAL KEY OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH NEVER IMPOSED ITSELF
THERE WAS A LITTLE SHIFTING OF GROUPS JULIE SAW THAT MONTRESOR AND CAPTAIN WARKWORTH WERE TOGETHER BY THE FIREPLACE
WAS TO BE ENCOURAGED TO TALK ABOUT WARKWORTH THE GENERAL WAS OF COURSE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH HIS PROFESSIONAL RECORD BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL INDIAN OPINIONS A FEW INCIDENTS IN THE YOUNG MAN'S EARLIER CAREER
IT WAS TO SEE HIM THAT YOU RISKED THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU HAVE USED MY HOUSE FOR YOUR OWN INTRIGUES JULIE FELT HERSELF PHYSICALLY WAVERING UNDER THE LASH OF THESE SENTENCES BUT WITH A GREAT EFFORT
LOOKING BEHIND HIM HE SAW THAT JACOB DELAFIELD WHO HAD JUST RETURNED FROM THE HALL WAS ENDEAVORING TO APPEASE LADY HENRY HE BENT TOWARDS JULIE DON'T DECEIVE YOURSELF HE SAID QUICKLY IN A LOW VOICE THIS IS THE END
AND RADIANT WITH THE ANIMATION OF SUCCESS BUT ONE THING AT LAST SHE HAD FORGOTTEN SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO IMPOSE ANY CURB UPON THE VOICES ROUND HER THE DUCHESS AND LORD LACKINGTON WERE SPARRING LIKE A COUPLE OF CHILDREN
SO YOU AND THIS LADY SHE POINTED A SHAKING FINGER AT JULIE HAVE HELD MY RECEPTION FOR ME I AM ENORMOUSLY OBLIGED YOU HAVE ALSO
PROVIDED MY GUESTS WITH REFRESHMENT I THANK YOU I TRUST MY SERVANTS HAVE GIVEN YOU SATISFACTION GENTLEMEN SHE TURNED TO THE REST OF THE COMPANY WHO STOOD STUPEFIED
YOU AND EVELYN CROWBOROUGH HAVE MEDDLED A GOOD DEAL TOO MUCH IN THEM ALREADY GOOD NIGHT
THAT LADY MADE A SUDDEN IMPETUOUS MOVEMENT TOWARDS HIM STRANGE WORDS WERE ON HER LIPS A STRANGE EXPRESSION IN HER EYES YOU MUST HELP ME SHE SAID BROKENLY IT IS MY RIGHT
AND ONCE MORE LOWERED THEIR VOICES BUT THE COFFEE BROUGHT A SPIRIT OF FESTIVITY CHAIRS WERE DRAWN UP THE BLAZING FIRE SHONE OUT UPON A SEMICIRCLE OF PEOPLE REPRESENTING JUST THOSE ELEMENTS OF MINGLED INTIMACY AND NOVELTY
EXCEPT THAT HE LIKED MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON AND OFTEN WONDERED HOW THE DEUCE LADY HENRY HAD EVER DISCOVERED SUCH AN INTERESTING AND DELIGHTFUL PERSON TO FILL SUCH AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BUT THIS FRENCHMAN CHALLENGED AND EXCITED HIM
HE WHISPERED IT GOES INTO OTHER HANDS MISTER SUTHERLAND WHO HAD TURNED OVER THE DOCUMENT AS HIS SON APPROACHED BREATHED MORE EASILY TAKING UP HIS PEN HE DIPPED IT IN THE INK FREDERICK WATCHED HIM WITH CONSTANTLY WHITENING CHEEK
THERE IS REALLY NO NEED FOR ANY CONVERSATION BETWEEN US MISS LE BRETON SAID THE FAMILIAR VOICE BUT IF THERE WERE
HIS EYES STILL RESTED ON HIS SON NOW MURMURED THE YOUNG MAN THERE IS A TRAIN LEAVING SOON I WISH TO GET IT AWAY ON THAT TRAIN HIS FATHER FROWNED WITH NATURAL DISTRUST
HER TROUBLED GAZE WAS FIXED ON LADY HENRY THAT LADY EYED HER COMPANION WITH COMPOSURE THOUGH BY NOW EVEN THE OLD LIPS WERE WHOLLY BLANCHED
YOU MIGHT AS WELL PROCLAIM YOURSELF A FORGER OUTRIGHT AS TO FORCE YOUR FATHER TO DECLARE THIS TO BE HIS SIGNATURE HE OBSERVED I KNOW IT SAID FREDERICK
THE OLD GENTLEMAN LOOKED STARTLED AND NERVOUSLY FINGERED THE PAPER HE HAD LET FALL WHY DO YOU SAY YOU WILL SOON BE IN A POSITION TO REPAY ME WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
REMEMBER MY LETTER LET ME HEAR TO MORROW AS DOCTOR MEREDITH LEFT THE ROOM JULIE LIFTED HER EYES ONLY JACOB DELAFIELD AND LADY HENRY WERE LEFT HARRY WARKWORTH TOO WAS GONE WITHOUT A WORD
I MEAN TO MAKE A MAN OF MYSELF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE LOOK WHICH MISTER SUTHERLAND GAVE HIM WAS MORE INQUIRING THAN SYMPATHETIC AND YOU NEED THIS MONEY FOR A START SAID HE FREDERICK BOWED
SOME ONE SOFTLY OPENED THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM AND ENTERED THE HALL JULIE LOOKED ROUND HER STARTLED SHE SAW JACOB DELAFIELD WHO PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIP MOVED BY A SUDDEN IMPULSE SHE BOWED HER HEAD
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
AND IN RETURN TO PROTECT MYSELF I IN DEFENDING MYSELF HAVE BEEN LED I ADMIT IT INTO TAKING LIBERTIES THERE IS NO WAY OUT OF IT I SHALL OF COURSE LEAVE YOU TO MORROW MORNING
SAID LADY HENRY WITH A LAUGH
THE HANDS OF THE CLOCK POINTED TO A QUARTER TO TEN FATHER I HAVE MY WHOLE FUTURE IN WHICH TO THANK YOU CRIED FREDERICK SEIZING THE CHECK HIS FATHER HELD OUT TO HIM AND MAKING RAPIDLY FOR THE DOOR
I HAVE BORNE WHAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE BORNE I HAVE DEVOTED MYSELF TO YOU AND YOUR INTERESTS AND YOU HAVE TRAMPLED UPON AND TORTURED ME
FOR THEY WERE BOTH IN UNIFORM AND THE GENERAL WAS RESPLENDENT WITH STARS AND MEDALS
AND THIS MODEST GAYETY WAS THE MARK OF AN INTIMATE AND FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE AH I SEE THOUGHT MONTRESOR AMUSED P HAS BEEN WRITING TO HER THE LITTLE MINX
EVERY ONE CAME IN AS IT WERE ON TIPTOE IN EACH FACE A SENSE OF THE HUMOR OF THE SITUATION FOUGHT WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS DANGERS AS SOON AS MONTRESOR SAW THE LITTLE DUCHESS BY THE FIRE
AND UPON MY WORD THE VERY THING MY SOUL WAS LONGING FOR A CUP OF COFFEE
SHE LOOKED ROUND HER PITEOUSLY SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER THAT HE HAD SPOKEN THAT HE HAD BADE HER FAREWELL A STRANGE PANG CONVULSED HER
HE DROPPED THE PAPER WITH AN ALACRITY WHICH FREDERICK WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTICE FATHER HE BEGAN WITHOUT PREAMBLE OR EXCUSE
SLOWLY LABORIOUSLY LADY HENRY DRAGGED HERSELF FROM STEP TO STEP
AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE TOO WAS GONE DOCTOR MEREDITH AND GENERAL FERGUS STOOD BESIDE HER THE GENERAL HAD A KEEN SENSE OF HUMOR AND AS HE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THIS UNLAWFUL HOSTESS WHOSE PLIGHT HE UNDERSTOOD NO MORE THAN HIS OWN
SHE HAD BEEN TOUCHING INCIDENTS AND PERSONALITIES KNOWN ONLY TO THE INITIATED WITH A RESTRAINED GAYETY WHICH OFTEN BROKE DOWN INTO A CHARMING SHYNESS WHICH WAS READY TO BE SCARED AWAY IN A MOMENT BY A TONE TOO SERIOUS OR TOO POLEMICAL
IS IT AS WELL DONE AS THE ONE YOU TRIED TO PASS OFF ON BRADY FREDERICK CRINGED AND FOR A MOMENT LOOKED AS IF THE STRUGGLE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM
THE FLASH WHICH HAD NOT YET SUBSIDED FROM THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE EBBED SLOWLY AWAY AS HE ENCOUNTERED HIS FATHER'S EYE I MEAN TO WORK HE MURMURED
MEANWHILE THE FRENCHMAN HIS INTRODUCTIONS OVER LOOKED CURIOUSLY ROUND THE ROOM STUDIED ITS STATELY EMPTINESS THE BOOKS ON THE WALLS UNDER A TRELLIS WORK FAINTLY GILT THE THREE FINE PICTURES
MONTRESOR AGAIN APPROACHED HER LET ME TELL YOU HE SAID IMPLORINGLY
WAS THAT WHAT SHE SAID LORD LACKINGTON LOOKED AT HER IN ASTONISHMENT HE DID NOT SEE THAT LADY HENRY WAS WATCHING THEM WITH EAGERNESS LEANING HEAVILY ON HER STICKS HER LIPS PARTED IN A KEEN EXPECTANCY
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO DISTRUST ME BUT YOU ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK WATTLES WHAT I DID ONCE I CAN NEVER DO AGAIN AND I HOPE I MAY LIVE TO PROVE MYSELF A CHANGED MAN AS FOR THAT CHECK
WAS A GROUP OF MEN STILL IN THEIR HATS AND OVER COATS TALKING AND LAUGHING IN SUBDUED VOICES JULIE LE BRETON CAME FORWARD THE HATS WERE REMOVED AND THE TALL STOOPING FORM OF MONTRESOR ADVANCED
THAT YOU WILL NOT BE THE LOSER BY THIS MATERIAL PROOF OF CONFIDENCE IN ME AS I SHALL SOON BE IN A POSITION TO REPAY ALL MY DEBTS AMONG WHICH
ANOTHER TIME IF YOU PLEASE SHE SAID WITH A MOST CUTTING CALM AS I SAID BEFORE IT IS LATE IF I HAD BEEN EQUAL TO ENTERTAINING YOU SHE LOOKED ROUND UPON THEM ALL
YOU WILL KILL YOURSELF LET ME AT LEAST CALL DIXON YOU WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND SAID LADY HENRY INDOMITABLE
HE WAS ONE OF THE INTIMATES OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF SHE HERSELF HAD SUGGESTED TO MONTRESOR OF COURSE IN LADY HENRY'S NAME THAT HE SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO BRUTON STREET SOME WEDNESDAY EVENING PRESENTLY
AND HER SOCIAL CHIVALRY LADY HENRY LOOKED GRIMLY AT THE FRENCHMAN
OR DISCOMFORT RECALLED HER AT ONCE TO THE REALITIES OF HER OWN SITUATION BUT BEFORE SHE COULD REPLY A SOUND STRUCK ON HER EAR SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET WHAT WAS THAT SHE SAID A VOICE WAS HEARD IN THE HALL
BUT NOW GOOD NIGHT TRY TO SLEEP EVELYN AND I WILL DO ALL WE CAN WITH LADY HENRY JULIE DREW HERSELF OUT OF HIS HOLD
SAID THAT YOUNG MAN AFTER PERHAPS A MOMENT'S HESITATION AND THROWING OFF HIS COAT ONLY PLEASE MAKE NO NOISE SAID MISS LE BRETON TURNING TO THE GROUP LADY HENRY MIGHT BE DISTURBED
MONTRESOR WENT UP TO HER MY DEAR OLD FRIEND LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU
DON'T CONTRADICT IT DISTRESSES ME TO HEAR YOU WELL NOW WE PART OF COURSE
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A VOICE IN HER EAR DO YOU KNOW I THINK WE OUGHT TO CLEAR OUT IT MUST BE CLOSE ON MIDNIGHT SHE LOOKED UP STARTLED TO SEE JACOB DELAFIELD HIS EXPRESSION OF DOUBT
WAS PUTTING SHARP LITTLE QUESTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME WITH AS FEW WORDS AS MIGHT BE JULIE UNDERSTOOD THAT AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WAS GOING ON THAT MONTRESOR
WAS NOW TO BE ADDRESSED TOGETHER WITH SOME QUOTATIONS FROM PRIVATE LETTERS OF HER OWN OR LADY HENRY'S WHICH JULIE WITH HER USUAL SKILL WAS ABLE TO SLIP INTO HIS EAR ALL ON THE ASSUMPTION DELICATELY MAINTAINED
SHE TRIED TO WITHDRAW HER HAND BUT ONLY FEEBLY
HIS MOUTH TWITCHED WITH REPRESSED LAUGHTER BUT DOCTOR MEREDITH DID NOT LAUGH
AH I SEE FOR JULIE LE BRETON WAS ALREADY CONVERSING WITH THE DISTINGUISHED FRENCHMAN
LADY HENRY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND PANTING BEGAN TO PULL HERSELF UP THE STAIRS OH DO LET ME HELP YOU
ON THE CONTRARY SAID THE DUCHESS AS SHE RETURNED GENERAL FERGUS'S BOW
SUPPLE AND APPARENTLY IMPARTIAL THAT THE ATTENTION OF EUROPE HAD BEEN WON ITS AUTHOR HAD BEEN FORMERLY A PROMINENT OFFICIAL OF THE FRENCH FOREIGN OFFICE AND WAS NOW SOMEWHAT OUT OF FAVOR WITH HIS COUNTRYMEN
AND SHE PLACED HERS IN IT MECHANICALLY IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT HE WHISPERED KINDLY LADY HENRY WILL SOON BE HERSELF AGAIN SHALL I TELL THE BUTLER TO CALL FOR SOME ONE HER MAID JULIE SHOOK HER HEAD
I WILL BE BACK BEFORE MIDNIGHT AND HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN STAIRS JUST AS THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND WATTLES STEPPED IN AH
AS LADY HENRY HERSELF WOULD HAVE TALKED TO MUCH BETTER EFFECT HAD SHE BEEN PRESENT THE GENERAL GAVE HER A GRAVE AND FRIENDLY ATTENTION FEW MEN HAD DONE STERNER OR MORE DARING FEATS IN THE FIELD YET HERE HE SAT
TELL EVELYN I WILL COME TO SEE HER AT ANY RATE AS SOON AS I CAN PUT MY THINGS TOGETHER GOOD NIGHT AND SHE TOO DRAGGED HERSELF UP STAIRS SOBBING
SHE MADE A LITTLE SWAYING MOVEMENT TOWARDS HER DEAR JULIE SHE CRIED IMPLORINGLY BUT LADY HENRY TURNED YOU WILL HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO MORROW SHE SAID AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED
SAID MONTRESOR WE WANT SOME RELAXATION HE PUT ON HIS EYE GLASSES LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM AND GENTLY RUBBED HIS HANDS HOW VERY AGREEABLE THIS IS WHAT A CHARMING ROOM
WHICH QUICKLY MADE ITSELF APPARENT IN ENGLISH SHE WAS A LINK A SOCIAL CONJUNCTION SHE EASED ALL DIFFICULTIES SHE PIECED ALL THREADS BUT IN FRENCH HER TONGUE WAS LOOSENED
SHE FELT HIS OWN TREMBLE AND YET ITS GRASP WAS FIRM AND SUPPORTING COURAGE HE SAID BENDING OVER HER TRY NOT TO GIVE WAY YOU WILL WANT ALL YOUR FORTITUDE LISTEN
MEANWHILE BEGAN TO CONSIDER THIS LADY IN BLACK WITH MORE AND MORE ATTENTION THE TALK GLIDED INTO A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE EGYPTIAN POSITION
MISS LE BRETON WILL HAVE NO ENGAGEMENTS LORD LACKINGTON QUIETLY SAID GOOD NIGHT LADY HENRY AND WITHOUT OFFERING TO SHAKE HANDS WALKED PAST HER AS HE CAME TO THE SPOT WHERE JULIE LE BRETON STOOD
MISTER DELAFIELD DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE BEST WILL YOU TELL HUTTON NOT TO LET IN ANYBODY ELSE SHE LOOKED AT HIM UNCERTAINLY AS THOUGH APPEALING TO HIM AS A RELATION OF LADY HENRY'S TO TAKE THE LEAD BY ALL MEANS
AND AN INFERIOR LADY HENRY NODDED GRIMLY IT IS TRUE SHE SAID INTERRUPTING I WAS NOT ABLE TO TAKE YOUR ROMANTIC VIEW OF THE OFFICE OF COMPANION YOU NEED ONLY HAVE TAKEN A HUMAN VIEW
ENTERED WITH TRAYS CONTAINING TEA AND COFFEE LEMONADE AND CAKES SHUT THE DOOR HUTTON PLEASE MADEMOISELLE LE BRETON IMPLORED AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT AT ONCE WE MUSTN'T MUSTN'T
THEN SHE RESUMED HER DIFFICULT WALK JULIE FOLLOWED HER KINDLY PUT OUT THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS SAID LADY HENRY AND JULIE OBEYED THEY ENTERED THE HALL IN WHICH ONE LITTLE LIGHT WAS BURNING
AND THEN QUICKLY THREW OFF HIS DEPRESSION NONSENSE NEXT WEEK SHE WILL BE SCOLDING US ALL WITH DOUBLE ENERGY MEANWHILE MAY WE SIT DOWN MADEMOISELLE TEN MINUTES
WHILE SHE RESTED NO LESS CHARMING AS A LISTENER THAN AS A TALKER
SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE RESISTED BUT HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO CONQUER MORE THAN HER HAND HE STOOD BESIDE HER LETTING HER FEEL THE WHOLE MUTE IMPETUOUS OFFER OF HIS MANHOOD THROWN AT HER FEET TO DO WHAT SHE WOULD WITH PRESENTLY
AND I BEGIN TO THINK IT DOES BUT LISTEN SUTHERLAND SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
INCLUDING ESPECIALLY A SHOOTING EXPEDITION OF MUCH DARING IN THE VERY DISTRICT
I THINK NOT THIS WILL COST ME DEAR SAID LADY HENRY HER WHITE LIPS TWITCHING SAY THEM NOW MADEMOISELLE YOU ARE SUFFERING JULIE MADE AN UNCERTAIN STEP FORWARD YOU OUGHT TO BE IN BED
THE CLOCK OVER THE MANTEL HAD TOLD OFF FIVE OF THE PRECIOUS MOMENTS I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU SAID HIS FATHER AND DREW OUT HIS CHECK BOOK BUT HE DID NOT HASTEN TO OPEN IT
YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BEFORE YOU EMBARKED UPON IT IF I WERE TO DIE IN MOUNTING THESE STAIRS I WOULD NOT LET YOU HELP ME OH CRIED JULIE AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK AND HID HER EYES WITH HER HAND
LORD LACKINGTON WOKE UP HANDSOME WHITE HAIRED DREAMER THAT HE WAS HE HAD BEEN LOOKING INTO THE FIRE HALF SMILING MORE OCCUPIED IN TRUTH WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS THAN WITH HIS COMPANIONS DELAFIELD HAD BROUGHT HIM IN
IN A CONDITION TO SAY IT SO WHEN YOU CAME UP TO SAY GOOD NIGHT TO ME YOU HAD DETERMINED ON THIS ADVENTURE YOU HAD BEEN GOOD ENOUGH I SEE TO REARRANGE MY ROOM
TILL JACOB LOOKED ROUND UPON HER WITH A FRIENDLY SMILE WHICH SET HER TONGUE FREE AGAIN
THEN JULIE WITHDREW I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE SAID HURRIEDLY I BEG YOUR PARDON GOOD NIGHT LORD LACKINGTON HESITATED HIS FACE TOOK A PUZZLED EXPRESSION THEN HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
TO NIGHT CONSCIOUS THOUGH I AM THAT YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DENY ME THIS REQUEST AND THAT MY DEBT TO YOU ALREADY PASSES THE BOUND OF PRESUMPTION ON MY PART AND INDULGENCE ON YOURS
I CANNOT TELL YOU WHY I WANT IT OR FOR WHAT THAT BELONGS TO MY PAST LIFE THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH I HAVE NOT YET ESCAPED BUT I FEEL BOUND TO STATE
LADY HENRY SMILED IN CONTEMPT YOU HARDLY SHOW YOUR USUAL ABILITY BY THESE REMARKS THE ROOM YOU STAND IN SHE GLANCED SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE LIGHTS AND THE CHAIRS GIVES YOU THE LIE
LIFTED ASTONISHED EYES ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE ROOM STOOD AN OLD LADY LEANING HEAVILY ON TWO STICKS SHE WAS DEATHLY PALE AND HER FIERCE EYES BLAZED UPON THE SCENE BEFORE HER
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR TWENTY YEARS THAT I HAVE NOT FOUND HER ON A WEDNESDAY EVENING HE SAID WITH A SUDDEN TOUCH OF FEELING WHICH BECAME HIM AT OUR AGE THE SMALLEST BREAK IN THE OLD HABIT HE SIGHED
WERE AVOIDED WITH A SKILL THAT NO ONE REALIZED TILL EACH SEPARATE ROCK WAS SAFELY PASSED PRESENTLY
OH AUNT FLORA DEAR AUNT FLORA BUT WE THOUGHT YOU WERE TOO ILL TO COME DOWN SO I PERCEIVE SAID LADY HENRY PUTTING HER ASIDE
DRAWING HIM SWIFTLY OUT OF THE HOUSE IT HAS MY FATHER'S SIGNATURE UPON IT YOUR FATHER'S SIGNATURE YES WATTLES GAVE IT A LOOK THEN SLOWLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT FREDERICK

IF YOU OBLIGE ME WATTLES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE WAS A MAGNIFICENT LOOKING MAN AND TOWERED IN THAT OLD COLONIAL HALL LIKE A YOUTHFUL GIANT I BEAR YOU NO ILL WILL
I THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT SOMETHING IS TO SAVE YOURSELF FROM BEING THOUGHT GUILTY OF A BIG CRIME YOU ARE WILLING TO INCUR SUSPICION OF A SMALL ONE
THE STEP ON THE WALK HAD MOUNTED TO THE FRONT DOOR NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY INQUIRED THE FATHER NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ANSWERED THE SON THE JUDGE
THE LABORED BREATH THE SLOW PAINFUL STEP OH SHE WOULDN'T LET ME HELP HER SHE SAID SHE WOULD RATHER DIE PERHAPS I HAVE KILLED HER AND I COULD I COULD YES I COULD HAVE LOVED HER
HAD BEEN ENDEAVORING TO MAKE UP FOR HIM WAS NOW PERHAPS ENGAGED IN MAKING IT UP FOR HIMSELF WITH A QUICKENED PULSE SHE TURNED TO FIND GENERAL FERGUS BESIDE HER WHAT A FRANK AND SOLDIERLY COUNTENANCE A LITTLE ROUGHLY CUT
OTHERWISE IT SHOULD BE TERMED
WHEN ONE DREAMS AND IN THE DREAM SUSPECTS THAT HE DREAMS THE SUSPICION NEVER FAILS TO CONFIRM ITSELF AND THE SLEEPER IS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AROUSED THUS NOVALIS ERRS
MY COMPANIONS AND HAVING SUCCEEDED IN GAINING OVER A FEW OF THEM TO MY PURPOSE MADE A FRANTIC SALLY FROM THE KIOSK WE RUSHED AMID THE CROWD THAT SURROUNDED IT THEY RETREATED AT FIRST BEFORE US
YOU WILL PERCEIVE BY THESE MANUSCRIPTS HERE THE SPEAKER PRODUCED A NOTE BOOK IN WHICH SEVERAL PAGES APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN FRESHLY WRITTEN THAT AT THE VERY PERIOD
SCARCELY HAD HE DISAPPEARED IN THE MIST BEFORE
ALL WAS RIGOROUSLY SELF CONSISTENT AT FIRST DOUBTING THAT I WAS REALLY AWAKE I ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF TESTS WHICH SOON CONVINCED ME THAT I REALLY WAS NOW
AND DULL AS TO CONVEY THE IDEA OF THE EYES OF A LONG INTERRED CORPSE THESE PECULIARITIES OF PERSON APPEARED TO CAUSE HIM MUCH ANNOYANCE
WITH IT CAME THE SENSE OF ELASTICITY AND OF LIGHT THIS LATTER I FELT NOT SAW IN AN INSTANT I SEEMED TO RISE FROM THE GROUND BUT I HAD NO BODILY NO VISIBLE
WITHOUT EXACTLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT WAS AGAINST THE CROWD WHICH ENVIRONED ME HOWEVER I EXPERIENCED A DEEP SENTIMENT OF ANIMOSITY I SHRANK FROM AMID THEM AND SWIFTLY BY A CIRCUITOUS PATH
AND THESE SENSES NOW BROUGHT TO MY SOUL A WORLD OF NOVEL AND SINGULAR SENSATION THE HEAT BECAME ALL AT ONCE INTOLERABLE A STRANGE ODOR LOADED THE BREEZE A LOW CONTINUOUS MURMUR
THIS CREATURE FASTENED ITSELF UPON A SMALL ARTERY IN THE RIGHT TEMPLE ITS CLOSE RESEMBLANCE TO THE MEDICINAL LEECH CAUSED THE MISTAKE TO BE OVERLOOKED UNTIL TOO LATE N B
HAS HITHERTO PREVENTED ME FROM SHOWING WE LOOKED AT THE PICTURE WHICH HE PRESENTED I SAW NOTHING IN IT OF AN EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER BUT ITS EFFECT UPON BEDLOE WAS PRODIGIOUS
HAD BEEN TRODDEN NEVER BEFORE BY THE FOOT OF A HUMAN BEING SO ENTIRELY SECLUDED AND IN FACT INACCESSIBLE EXCEPT THROUGH A SERIES OF ACCIDENTS IS THE ENTRANCE OF THE RAVINE
UPON A DIM WARM MISTY DAY TOWARD THE CLOSE OF NOVEMBER AND DURING THE STRANGE INTERREGNUM OF THE SEASONS WHICH IN AMERICA IS TERMED THE INDIAN SUMMER MISTER BEDLOE DEPARTED AS USUAL FOR THE HILLS
THAT IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I WAS INDEED THE FIRST ADVENTURER THE VERY FIRST AND SOLE ADVENTURER
REACHED AND ENTERED THE CITY HERE ALL WAS THE WILDEST TUMULT AND CONTENTION
IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT THE ORBS GREW BRIGHT TO A DEGREE ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE SEEMING TO EMIT LUMINOUS RAYS
AND NOT ALTOGETHER HORRORLESS CURIOSITY RESPECTING YOURSELF IN YOUR DETAIL OF THE VISION WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO YOU AMID THE HILLS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED
IN THE GLEAMING OF A DEW DROP IN THE BREATHING OF THE WIND IN THE FAINT ODORS THAT CAME FROM THE FOREST THERE CAME A WHOLE UNIVERSE OF SUGGESTION A GAY AND MOTLEY TRAIN OF RHAPSODICAL AND
IN HEALTH NO WORSE THAN USUAL AND IN RATHER MORE THAN ORDINARY SPIRITS THE ACCOUNT WHICH HE GAVE OF HIS EXPEDITION AND OF THE EVENTS WHICH HAD DETAINED HIM WAS A SINGULAR ONE INDEED YOU WILL REMEMBER SAID HE
IN A CHARLOTTESVILLE PAPER WE HAVE THE PAINFUL DUTY OF ANNOUNCING THE DEATH OF MISTER AUGUSTUS BEDLO A GENTLEMAN WHOSE AMIABLE MANNERS AND MANY VIRTUES HAVE LONG ENDEARED HIM
AT WHICH I HAD ENCOUNTERED THE HYENA I AGAIN EXPERIENCED A SHOCK
AT THIS SHADOW I GAZED WONDERINGLY FOR MANY MINUTES ITS CHARACTER STUPEFIED ME WITH ASTONISHMENT I LOOKED UPWARD THE TREE WAS A PALM I NOW AROSE HURRIEDLY AND IN A STATE OF FEARFUL AGITATION
VERY SUDDENLY MY ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY THE LOUD BEATING OF A DRUM MY AMAZEMENT WAS OF COURSE EXTREME
YOU AROSE AND DESCENDED INTO THE CITY I AROSE CONTINUED BEDLOE REGARDING THE DOCTOR WITH AN AIR OF PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT I AROSE AS YOU SAY AND
I WAS SPEAKING WITH THE EDITOR OF THE PAPER IN QUESTION UPON THE TOPIC OF THIS REMARKABLE ACCIDENT WHEN IT OCCURRED TO ME TO ASK HOW IT HAPPENED THAT THE NAME OF THE DECEASED HAD BEEN GIVEN AS BEDLO
AND NOW AN INDESCRIBABLE UNEASINESS POSSESSED ME A SPECIES OF NERVOUS HESITATION AND TREMOR I FEARED TO TREAD LEST I SHOULD BE PRECIPITATED INTO SOME ABYSS I REMEMBERED TOO STRANGE STORIES
WHICH I NEED NOT ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE A STRONG AND BRIEF GUST OF WIND
WHEN I SAID THESE WORDS I OF COURSE EXPECTED SOME LIVELY SALLY FROM BEDLOE IN REPLY BUT TO MY ASTONISHMENT HE HESITATED TREMBLED BECAME FEARFULLY PALLID AND REMAINED SILENT
AND ABSOLUTELY SWARMED WITH INHABITANTS THE HOUSES WERE WILDLY PICTURESQUE ON EVERY HAND WAS A WILDERNESS OF BALCONIES OF VERANDAS OF MINARETS OF SHRINES AND FANTASTICALLY CARVED ORIELS
THE PARTY IN THE KIOSK WERE SEPOYS AND BRITISH OFFICERS HEADED BY HASTINGS OF THIS PARTY I WAS ONE
TO THE CITIZENS OF CHARLOTTESVILLE MISTER B FOR SOME YEARS PAST HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO NEURALGIA WHICH HAS OFTEN THREATENED TO TERMINATE FATALLY BUT THIS CAN BE REGARDED ONLY AS THE MEDIATE CAUSE OF HIS DECEASE
HAS IT COME TO PASS THAT ONE TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN ANY FICTION FOR BEDLOE WITHOUT THE E
HE AT LENGTH SAID HOARSELY TO BEDLOE FOR MANY MINUTES CONTINUED THE LATTER MY SOLE SENTIMENT MY SOLE FEELING WAS THAT OF DARKNESS AND
ENTHUSIASTIC HIS IMAGINATION WAS SINGULARLY VIGOROUS AND CREATIVE AND NO DOUBT IT DERIVED ADDITIONAL FORCE FROM THE HABITUAL USE OF MORPHINE WHICH HE SWALLOWED IN GREAT QUANTITY
THE SENSE OF WEIGHT OF VOLITION OF SUBSTANCE RETURNED I BECAME MY ORIGINAL SELF AND BENT MY STEPS EAGERLY HOMEWARD BUT THE PAST HAD NOT LOST THE VIVIDNESS OF THE REAL
A TALE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS DURING THE FALL OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WHILE RESIDING NEAR CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA I CASUALLY MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MISTER AUGUSTUS BEDLOE
LATE DAYS HAS BECOME SO COMMON AS TO ATTRACT LITTLE OR NO ATTENTION BUT WHICH AT THE PERIOD OF WHICH I WRITE HAD VERY RARELY BEEN KNOWN IN AMERICA I MEAN TO SAY THAT BETWEEN DOCTOR TEMPLETON AND BEDLOE
LIKE THAT ARISING FROM A FULL BUT GENTLY FLOWING RIVER CAME TO MY EARS INTERMINGLED WITH THE PECULIAR HUM OF MULTITUDINOUS HUMAN VOICES WHILE I LISTENED IN AN EXTREMITY OF ASTONISHMENT
I PERCEIVED A VAST CROWD IN FURIOUS AGITATION SURROUNDING AND ASSAULTING A GAY PALACE THAT OVERHUNG THE RIVER PRESENTLY
I JOINED THE WEAKER PARTY ARMING MYSELF WITH THE WEAPONS OF A FALLEN OFFICER AND FIGHTING I KNEW NOT WHOM WITH THE NERVOUS FEROCITY OF DESPAIR
VERY SUDDENLY AND BY SOME INCONCEIVABLE IMPULSE I BECAME INTENSELY IMBUED WITH PERSONAL INTEREST IN WHAT WAS GOING ON I SEEMED TO FEEL THAT I HAD AN IMPORTANT PART TO PLAY
I COULD PERCEIVE ITS EVERY NOOK AND CORNER AS IF DELINEATED ON A MAP THE STREETS SEEMED INNUMERABLE AND CROSSED EACH OTHER IRREGULARLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS BUT WERE RATHER LONG WINDING ALLEYS THAN STREETS
IN WHICH YOU FANCIED THESE THINGS AMID THE HILLS I WAS ENGAGED IN DETAILING THEM UPON PAPER HERE AT HOME IN ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THIS CONVERSATION THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS APPEARED
ATTENDED WITH GREAT DETERMINATION OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD TO RELIEVE THIS DOCTOR TEMPLETON RESORTED TO TOPICAL BLEEDING LEECHES WERE APPLIED TO THE TEMPLES IN A FEARFULLY BRIEF PERIOD
WHENCE HE CAME I NEVER ASCERTAINED EVEN ABOUT HIS AGE ALTHOUGH I CALL HIM A YOUNG GENTLEMAN THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH PERPLEXED ME IN NO LITTLE DEGREE HE CERTAINLY SEEMED YOUNG AND HE MADE A POINT OF SPEAKING ABOUT HIS YOUTH
THE SIGHT OF THIS MONSTER RATHER RELIEVED THAN HEIGHTENED MY TERRORS FOR I NOW MADE SURE THAT I DREAMED
DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF WARREN HASTINGS I WAS THEN ONLY TWENTY YEARS OLD WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU MISTER BEDLOE AT SARATOGA IT WAS THE MIRACULOUS SIMILARITY
THIS PATH WAS EXCESSIVELY SINUOUS AND AS THE SUN COULD NOT BE SEEN I SOON LOST ALL IDEA OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH I JOURNEYED IN THE MEANTIME THE MORPHINE HAD ITS CUSTOMARY EFFECT
A BOAT WAS AT HAND IN WHICH HE ESCAPED TO THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE RIVER
THE SOUL OF THE MAN OF TO DAY IS UPON THE VERGE OF SOME STUPENDOUS PSYCHAL DISCOVERIES LET US CONTENT OURSELVES WITH THIS SUPPOSITION
FOR THE FANCY THAT I DREAMED WOULD SERVE ME NO LONGER I SAW I FELT
THERE HAD GROWN UP LITTLE BY LITTLE A VERY DISTINCT AND STRONGLY MARKED RAPPORT OR MAGNETIC RELATION I AM NOT PREPARED TO ASSERT HOWEVER THAT THIS RAPPORT EXTENDED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE SIMPLE SLEEP PRODUCING POWER
WITH THE ARROW IN MY TEMPLE THE WHOLE HEAD GREATLY SWOLLEN AND DISFIGURED BUT ALL THESE THINGS I FELT NOT SAW I TOOK INTEREST IN NOTHING EVEN THE CORPSE SEEMED A MATTER IN WHICH I HAD NO CONCERN
I FOUND MYSELF AT THE FOOT OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN AND LOOKING DOWN INTO A VAST PLAIN THROUGH WHICH WOUND A MAJESTIC RIVER ON THE MARGIN OF THIS RIVER STOOD AN EASTERN LOOKING CITY
NONENTITY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF DEATH AT LENGTH THERE SEEMED TO PASS A VIOLENT AND SUDDEN SHOCK THROUGH MY SOUL AS IF OF ELECTRICITY
THE PATIENT DIED WHEN IT APPEARED THAT IN THE JAR CONTAINING THE LEECHES HAD BEEN INTRODUCED BY ACCIDENT ONE OF THE VENOMOUS VERMICULAR SANGSUES WHICH ARE NOW AND THEN FOUND IN THE NEIGHBORING PONDS
WHICH TOOK PLACE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY WHEN HASTINGS WAS PUT IN IMMINENT PERIL OF HIS LIFE THE MAN ESCAPING BY THE STRING OF TURBANS WAS CHEYTE SING HIMSELF
IMMETHODICAL THOUGHT BUSIED IN THIS I WALKED ON FOR SEVERAL HOURS DURING WHICH THE MIST DEEPENED AROUND ME TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT THAT AT LENGTH I WAS REDUCED TO AN ABSOLUTE GROPING OF THE WAY
THE POISONOUS SANGSUE OF CHARLOTTESVILLE MAY ALWAYS BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE MEDICINAL LEECH BY ITS BLACKNESS AND ESPECIALLY BY ITS WRITHING OR VERMICULAR MOTIONS WHICH VERY NEARLY RESEMBLE THOSE OF A SNAKE
AMID THE MILLION OF BLACK AND YELLOW MEN TURBANED AND ROBED AND OF FLOWING BEARD THERE ROAMED A COUNTLESS MULTITUDE OF HOLY FILLETED BULLS
IT SEEMED TO BE HIS DESIGN RATHER TO INSINUATE THAN DIRECTLY TO ASSERT THAT PHYSICALLY HE HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN WHAT HE WAS THAT A LONG SERIES OF NEURALGIC ATTACKS HAD REDUCED HIM FROM A CONDITION
HE NEARLY FAINTED AS HE GAZED AND YET IT WAS BUT A MINIATURE PORTRAIT A MIRACULOUSLY ACCURATE ONE TO BE SURE OF HIS OWN VERY REMARKABLE FEATURES AT LEAST THIS WAS MY THOUGHT
THERE DESCENDED AN EFFEMINATE LOOKING PERSON
HERE STOOPING I BATHED MY HANDS AND MY HEAD AND NECK THIS SEEMED TO DISSIPATE THE EQUIVOCAL SENSATIONS WHICH HAD HITHERTO ANNOYED ME
SUCH AS WE READ OF IN THE ARABIAN TALES BUT OF A CHARACTER EVEN MORE SINGULAR THAN ANY THERE DESCRIBED FROM MY POSITION WHICH WAS FAR ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE TOWN
AND THEN SET FORTH ALONE OR ATTENDED ONLY BY A DOG UPON A LONG RAMBLE AMONG THE CHAIN OF WILD AND DREARY HILLS THAT LIE WESTWARD AND SOUTHWARD OF CHARLOTTESVILLE AND ARE THERE DIGNIFIED BY THE TITLE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS
THEY RALLIED FOUGHT MADLY AND RETREATED AGAIN IN THE MEAN TIME WE WERE BORNE FAR FROM THE KIOSK AND BECAME BEWILDERED AND ENTANGLED AMONG THE NARROW STREETS OF TALL OVERHANGING HOUSES
I STEPPED BOLDLY AND BRISKLY FORWARD I RUBBED MY EYES I CALLED ALOUD I PINCHED MY LIMBS
ALTHOUGH SOUND THAN I HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN TEETH IN A HUMAN HEAD THE EXPRESSION OF HIS SMILE HOWEVER WAS BY NO MEANS UNPLEASING AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED BUT IT HAD NO VARIATION WHATEVER
AND NOT NOW EVEN FOR AN INSTANT CAN I COMPEL MY UNDERSTANDING TO REGARD IT AS A DREAM NOR WAS IT SAID TEMPLETON WITH AN AIR OF DEEP SOLEMNITY YET IT WOULD
AS I REGARDED IT YOU WILL PERCEIVE SAID TEMPLETON THE DATE OF THIS PICTURE IT IS HERE SCARCELY VISIBLE IN THIS CORNER SEVENTEEN EIGHTY
I PRESUME I SAID YOU HAVE AUTHORITY FOR THIS SPELLING BUT I HAVE ALWAYS SUPPOSED THE NAME TO BE WRITTEN WITH AN E AT THE END AUTHORITY NO HE REPLIED
THEY WERE MADE TO IMITATE THE BODY OF A CREEPING SERPENT AND WERE LONG AND BLACK WITH A POISONED BARB ONE OF THEM STRUCK ME UPON THE RIGHT TEMPLE I REELED AND FELL
LITTERS WITH STATELY DAMES CLOSE VEILED ELEPHANTS GORGEOUSLY CAPARISONED IDOLS GROTESQUELY HEWN DRUMS BANNERS AND GONGS SPEARS SILVER AND GILDED MACES AND AMID THE CROWD AND THE CLAMOR
HAD MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH DOCTOR TEMPLETON BY WHICH THE LATTER IN CONSIDERATION OF A LIBERAL ANNUAL ALLOWANCE HAD CONSENTED TO DEVOTE HIS TIME AND MEDICAL EXPERIENCE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE CARE OF THE INVALID
THE RABBLE PRESSED IMPETUOUSLY UPON US HARRASSING US WITH THEIR SPEARS AND OVERWHELMING US WITH FLIGHTS OF ARROWS THESE LATTER WERE VERY REMARKABLE AND RESEMBLED IN SOME RESPECTS THE WRITHING CREESE OF THE MALAY
HE STOOPED MUCH HIS LIMBS WERE EXCEEDINGLY LONG AND EMACIATED HIS FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND LOW HIS COMPLEXION WAS ABSOLUTELY BLOODLESS
AUDIBLE OR PALPABLE PRESENCE THE CROWD HAD DEPARTED THE TUMULT HAD CEASED THE CITY WAS IN COMPARATIVE REPOSE BENEATH ME LAY MY CORPSE
THAT OF ENDUING ALL THE EXTERNAL WORLD WITH AN INTENSITY OF INTEREST IN THE QUIVERING OF A LEAF IN THE HUE OF A BLADE OF GRASS IN THE SHAPE OF A TREFOIL IN THE HUMMING OF A BEE
CLAD IN GARMENTS HALF INDIAN HALF EUROPEAN AND OFFICERED BY GENTLEMEN IN A UNIFORM PARTLY BRITISH WERE ENGAGED AT GREAT ODDS WITH THE SWARMING RABBLE OF THE ALLEYS
FOR THE REST I HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO MAKE HERE IS A WATERCOLOR DRAWING WHICH I SHOULD HAVE SHOWN YOU BEFORE BUT WHICH AN UNACCOUNTABLE SENTIMENT OF HORROR
OF MORE THAN USUAL PERSONAL BEAUTY TO THAT WHICH I SAW FOR MANY YEARS PAST HE HAD BEEN ATTENDED BY A PHYSICIAN NAMED TEMPLETON AN OLD GENTLEMAN PERHAPS SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE
OR DIMINUTION OF LIGHT UNDERWENT CONTRACTION
YET THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD LITTLE TROUBLE IN IMAGINING HIM A HUNDRED YEARS OF AGE BUT IN NO REGARD WAS HE MORE PECULIAR THAN IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE WAS SINGULARLY TALL AND THIN
TOLD ABOUT THESE RAGGED HILLS AND OF THE UNCOUTH AND FIERCE RACES OF MEN WHO TENANTED THEIR GROVES AND CAVERNS
OR A SOLITARY GRACEFUL MAIDEN TAKING HER WAY WITH A PITCHER UPON HER HEAD TO THE BANKS OF THE MAGNIFICENT RIVER
I SEATED MYSELF BENEATH A TREE PRESENTLY THERE CAME A FEEBLE GLEAM OF SUNSHINE AND THE SHADOW OF THE LEAVES OF THE TREE FELL FAINTLY BUT DEFINITELY UPON THE GRASS
WHOM HE HAD FIRST ENCOUNTERED AT SARATOGA AND FROM WHOSE ATTENTION WHILE THERE HE EITHER RECEIVED OR FANCIED THAT HE RECEIVED GREAT BENEFIT THE RESULT WAS THAT BEDLOE WHO WAS WEALTHY
IN THIS YEAR WAS THE PORTRAIT TAKEN IT IS THE LIKENESS OF A DEAD FRIEND A MISTER OLDEB TO WHOM I BECAME MUCH ATTACHED AT CALCUTTA
DESCENDED INTO THE CITY ON MY WAY I FELL IN WITH AN IMMENSE POPULACE CROWDING THROUGH EVERY AVENUE ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND EXHIBITING IN EVERY ACTION THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT
THE SOLITUDE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY VIRGIN
BUT NOT SO WHAT I SAW WHAT I HEARD WHAT I FELT WHAT I THOUGHT HAD ABOUT IT NOTHING OF THE UNMISTAKABLE IDIOSYNCRASY OF THE DREAM
BUT OF AN INTRINSIC LUSTRE AS DOES A CANDLE OR THE SUN YET THEIR ORDINARY CONDITION WAS SO TOTALLY VAPID FILMY
AND THIS SUCCESS HAD VERY NATURALLY INSPIRED THE LATTER WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE OPINIONS FROM WHICH THE REMEDIES HAD BEEN EDUCED THE DOCTOR HOWEVER LIKE ALL ENTHUSIASTS HAD STRUGGLED HARD TO MAKE A THOROUGH CONVERT OF HIS PUPIL
I BENT MY STEPS IMMEDIATELY TO THE MOUNTAINS AND ABOUT TEN ENTERED A GORGE WHICH WAS ENTIRELY NEW TO ME
THE INDIAN CITY OF BENARES UPON THE HOLY RIVER THE RIOTS THE COMBAT THE MASSACRE WERE THE ACTUAL EVENTS OF THE INSURRECTION OF CHEYTE SING
RUSHED PAST ME WITH A SHRIEK HE CAME SO CLOSE TO MY PERSON THAT I FELT HIS HOT BREATH UPON MY FACE
BAZAARS ABOUNDED AND IN THESE WERE DISPLAYED RICH WARES IN INFINITE VARIETY AND PROFUSION SILKS MUSLINS THE MOST DAZZLING CUTLERY THE MOST MAGNIFICENT JEWELS AND GEMS
BUT APPEARED TO BE IMPELLED INTO MOTION AND FLITTED BUOYANTLY OUT OF THE CITY RETRACING THE CIRCUITOUS PATH BY WHICH I HAD ENTERED IT WHEN I HAD ATTAINED THAT POINT OF THE RAVINE IN THE MOUNTAINS
THE NAME IS BEDLO WITH AN E ALL THE WORLD OVER AND I NEVER KNEW IT TO BE SPELT OTHERWISE IN MY LIFE THEN SAID I MUTTERINGLY AS I TURNED UPON MY HEEL THEN INDEED
I AM FORCED TO CLASS IT AMONG OTHER PHENOMENA IN THIS I AM NOT SURE THAT YOU ARE WRONG OBSERVED DOCTOR TEMPLETON BUT PROCEED
TO PREVENT THE RASH AND FATAL SALLY OF THE OFFICER WHO FELL IN THE CROWDED ALLEYS BY THE POISONED ARROW OF A BENGALEE THAT OFFICER WAS MY DEAREST FRIEND IT WAS OLDEB
SLEEP WAS BROUGHT ABOUT ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY BY THE MERE VOLITION OF THE OPERATOR EVEN WHEN THE INVALID WAS UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE IT IS ONLY NOW IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE
IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS POINT I WAS URGED PARTLY AND PERHAPS PRINCIPALLY BY A REGRETFUL MEMORY OF THE DECEASED
TO DEEPEN THE VAGUE IMPRESSIONS WHICH THESE OBJECTS CREATED
OR CLUNG TO THE MINARETS AND ORIELS FROM THE SWARMING STREETS TO THE BANKS OF THE RIVER THERE DESCENDED INNUMERABLE FLIGHTS OF STEPS LEADING TO BATHING PLACES
WE WERE SOON OVERPOWERED BY NUMBERS AND DRIVEN TO SEEK REFUGE IN A SPECIES OF KIOSK HERE WE BARRICADED OURSELVES AND FOR THE PRESENT WERE SECURE FROM A LOOP HOLE NEAR THE SUMMIT OF THE KIOSK
BUT A NEW AND STILL MORE ASTOUNDING SOURCE OF INTEREST AND PERPLEXITY AROSE THERE CAME A WILD RATTLING OR JINGLING SOUND
AN INSTANTANEOUS AND DREADFUL SICKNESS SEIZED ME I STRUGGLED I GASPED I DIED YOU WILL HARDLY PERSIST NOW SAID I SMILING THAT THE WHOLE OF YOUR ADVENTURE WAS NOT A DREAM
IT WAS HIS PRACTICE TO TAKE A VERY LARGE DOSE OF IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST EACH MORNING OR RATHER IMMEDIATELY AFTER A CUP OF STRONG COFFEE
THE SCENERY WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF ON ALL SIDES ALTHOUGH SCARCELY ENTITLED TO BE CALLED GRAND HAD ABOUT IT AN INDESCRIBABLE AND TO ME A DELICIOUS ASPECT OF DREARY DESOLATION
BUT THIS POWER ITSELF HAD ATTAINED GREAT INTENSITY AT THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO INDUCE THE MAGNETIC SOMNOLENCY THE MESMERIST ENTIRELY FAILED IN THE FIFTH OR SIXTH HE SUCCEEDED VERY PARTIALLY
AND HE WAS CONTINUALLY ALLUDING TO THEM IN A SORT OF HALF EXPLANATORY HALF APOLOGETIC STRAIN WHICH WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT IMPRESSED ME VERY PAINFULLY I SOON HOWEVER GREW ACCUSTOMED TO IT AND MY UNEASINESS WORE OFF
WHILE THE RIVER ITSELF SEEMED TO FORCE A PASSAGE WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE VAST FLEETS OF DEEPLY BURTHENED SHIPS THAT FAR AND WIDE ENCOUNTERED ITS SURFACE BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE CITY AROSE IN FREQUENT MAJESTIC GROUPS
THE PROXIMATE CAUSE WAS ONE OF ESPECIAL SINGULARITY IN AN EXCURSION TO THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS A FEW DAYS SINCE A SLIGHT COLD AND FEVER WERE CONTRACTED
AS I THOUGHT A NEW MAN AND PROCEEDED STEADILY AND COMPLACENTLY ON MY UNKNOWN WAY AT LENGTH QUITE OVERCOME BY EXERTION AND BY A CERTAIN OPPRESSIVE CLOSENESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE
THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS REMARKABLE IN EVERY RESPECT AND EXCITED IN ME A PROFOUND INTEREST AND CURIOSITY I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPREHEND HIM EITHER IN HIS MORAL OR HIS PHYSICAL RELATIONS OF HIS FAMILY I COULD OBTAIN NO SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT
DOCTOR TEMPLETON HAD BEEN A TRAVELLER IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS AND AT PARIS HAD BECOME A CONVERT IN GREAT MEASURE TO THE DOCTRINES OF MESMER IT WAS ALTOGETHER BY MEANS OF MAGNETIC REMEDIES
THE PALM AND THE COCOA
AND THE OTHER TWO SAINTS WHOSE FETE DAYS FALL THIS MONTH ABSURD PRAY TELL ME WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH IT WHAT INFLUENCE CAN THEY POSSIBLY HAVE ON THE TEMPERATURE
BUT STOPPED SHORT STUPEFIED AND FRIGHTENED WITHIN THREE STEPS OF HATTERAS WHO STARTED UP THAT MOMENT AND THROWING OFF HIS DISGUISE KNELT ON ONE KNEE AND AIMED STRAIGHT AT THE BEAR'S HEART
AND NOT HAVE WASTED MY SEED LIKE AN IGNORAMUS
AH IT IS THE BOAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND THAT MAN HATTERAS LET US DISCUSS THE QUESTION CALMLY AND EXAMINE THE CASE ON ALL SIDES THE COAST ON WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES AT PRESENT MAY TERMINATE ABRUPTLY
AND THE BRIGHT RAYS OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT DID DUTY FOR THE GLORIOUS ORB OF DAY
BUT BECAUSE THE BOAT WHICH BEARS HIM ACROSS AN UNKNOWN OCEAN OR TOUCHES THE NEW SHORE HAPPENS TO BE MADE OF THE PLANKS OF AN AMERICAN VESSEL A CAST AWAY WRECK OF NO USE TO ANYONE WILL THAT LESSEN THE HONOUR OF THE DISCOVERY
THEY STARTED VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING EACH ARMED WITH A DOUBLE BARRELLED GUN AND PLENTY OF POWDER AND SHOT
AND I'LL BET YOU SOMETHING I COULD DRESS YOU CUTLETS YOU WOULD NOT TURN UP YOUR NOSE AT UNLESS FOR THEIR BLACK APPEARANCE WE'LL SET YOU TO WORK ON IT SAID BELL AND I'LL EAT AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE TO PLEASE YOU MY GOOD BELL
YES ONLY I SHOULD LIKE FRESH WATER ICE IT IS HARDER AND MORE TRANSPARENT THAN THE OTHER THERE IT IS TO YOUR HAND IF I AM NOT MUCH MISTAKEN SAID JOHNSON
BUT DO WE NOT OWE OURS TO HIM NOW I GRANT WITHOUT US HE WOULD NOT BE ALIVE AT THIS MOMENT BUT WITHOUT HIM AND HIS SHIP WHAT WOULD BECOME OF US WELL MISTER CLAWBONNY YOU ARE HERE TO KEEP THINGS STRAIGHT ANYHOW AND THAT IS A BLESSING
IT IS A WALRUS EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR BE QUIET AND LET US GET UP TO HIM CLAWBONNY WAS RIGHT IT WAS A WALRUS OF HUGE DIMENSIONS DISPORTING HIMSELF NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
THEY LIVE ON SEALS AND NOTHING IS SO DELICIOUS TO THEM AS A PIECE OF THE FLESH DIPPED IN THE BLOOD AND OIL
CAN'T HE STAY HERE IN FORT PROVIDENCE HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO THAT HATTERAS AND MOREOVER TO LEAVE A MAN IN THAT WAY AND NOT KNOW WHETHER WE MIGHT FIND HIM SAFE WHEN WE CAME BACK WOULD BE WORSE THAN IMPRUDENT IT WOULD BE INHUMAN ALTAMONT WILL COME WITH US
SPEAKING TO HIMSELF ABSORBED IN HIS OWN REFLECTIONS YES THAT MIGHT DO AT A PINCH WHY NOT WE MIGHT TRY WHAT ARE YOU DREAMING ABOUT ASKED HATTERAS
HE SUCCEEDED THOUGH WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN REACHING THE TOP WHICH HE FOUND TERMINATED ABRUPTLY IN A SORT OF TRUNCATED CONE
HE MUST COME BUT WE NEED NOT DISCLOSE OUR PROJECTS LET US TELL HIM NOTHING BUT SIMPLY BUILD A SLOOP FOR THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF MAKING A SURVEY OF THE COAST HATTERAS COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO CONSENT BUT SAID
THE QUESTION WAS RAISED WHETHER TO CONSTRUCT A HUT AND REST TILL MORNING OR PROCEED BUT CLAWBONNY INSISTED ON GOING ON AS HATTERAS AND JOHNSON WOULD BE SO UNEASY DUK WILL GUIDE US HE SAID HE WON'T GO WRONG
WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT IT STRETCHES RIGHT AWAY TO THE POLE INDEED IF YOUR PRESENT INFORMATION PROVE CORRECT WE OUGHT TO COME TO AN OPEN SEA DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WELL SUPPOSING WE REACH THIS ARCTIC OCEAN AND FIND IT FREE FROM ICE AND EASY TO NAVIGATE
YES BUT THERE IS MORE CHANCE OF SUCCESS THAN IN TRYING ANY OTHER PLAN SO I MEAN TO RISK IT I AM GOING TO DRESS MYSELF IN THE SEAL'S SKIN AND CREEP ALONG THE ICE COME DON'T LET US LOSE TIME LOAD THE GUN AND GIVE IT ME
OR TO LEAVE THE LONG RIBBONS OF MEAT DANGLING FROM THE MOUTH AND DEVOUR THEM GRADUALLY LIKE BOA CONSTRICTORS
WITH A PIECE OF ICE WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD DO WHY NOT ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS TO COLLECT THE SUN'S RAYS INTO ONE COMMON FOCUS AND ICE WILL SERVE THAT PURPOSE AS WELL AS THE FINEST CRYSTAL IS IT POSSIBLE SAID JOHNSON
NO MY FRIEND I DON'T IT IS A LAST BLOW FROM THE COLD YOU SEE THESE ARE HIS DOMINIONS AND HE WON'T BE DRIVEN OUT WITHOUT MAKING SOME RESISTANCE HE CAN DEFEND HIMSELF PRETTY WELL SAID BELL RUBBING HIS FACE YES BUT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED
IT IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF STRENGTH BUT OF EXISTENCE
GLANCING UNEASILY AT THE TWO CAPTAINS
WHAT A FEAST THIS MEAL WAS TO THE POOR STARVING MEN MAY BE IMAGINED THE DOCTOR HOWEVER COUNSELLED MODERATION IN EATING AND SET THE EXAMPLE HIMSELF THIS IS A GLAD DAY FOR US HE SAID AND WE HAVE NO FEAR OF WANTING FOOD ALL THE REST OF OUR JOURNEY
WELL I HAVE NOT GOT IT NOW EXCLAIMED JOHNSON TURNING PALE
ONE MUST BE A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING YOU KNOW WAS CLAWBONNY'S MODEST REPLY
YET IT WAS HIGH TIME HE WERE BROUGHT TO REASON AS JUNE WAS AT HAND THE ONLY SEASON FOR DISTANT EXPEDITIONS AND THEY COULD NOT START WITHOUT A SHIP HE THOUGHT OVER IT A LONG WHILE AND AT LAST DREW THE CAPTAIN ASIDE AND SAID IN THE KINDEST GENTLEST WAY
BUT THEN WE MUST REMEMBER THAT ONE MEAL SOMETIMES HAS TO LAST A WHOLE DAY THIS VORACITY MUST BE PECULIAR TO THE INHABITANTS OF COLD COUNTRIES SAID ALTAMONT I THINK IT IS REPLIED THE DOCTOR IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS PEOPLE MUST EAT ENORMOUSLY
THAT IS THE FACT AND HOW IS IT EXPLAINED IN TWO WAYS SOME SAY THAT A LARGER NUMBER OF ASTEROIDS COME BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR
COURAGE HATTERAS SAID THE DOCTOR HANDING HIM THE WEAPON WHICH HE HAD CAREFULLY LOADED MEANWHILE NEVER FEAR BUT BE SURE YOU DON'T SHOW YOURSELVES TILL I FIRE THE DOCTOR SOON JOINED THE OLD BOATSWAIN BEHIND THE HUMMOCK AND TOLD HIM WHAT THEY HAD BEEN DOING
COME CLAWBONNY TELL US WHAT YOUR LIGHT IS TO BE THEN SAID ALTAMONT THAT'S SOON TOLD REPLIED CLAWBONNY I MEAN TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AN ELECTRIC LIGHT YES WHY NOT HAVEN'T YOU A GALVANIC BATTERY ON BOARD YOUR SHIP YES
BRUIN WENT TO WORK WITH EXTREME PRUDENCE THOUGH HIS EYES GLARED WITH GREEDY DESIRE TO CLUTCH THE COVETED PREY FOR HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN FASTING A MONTH IF NOT TWO HE ALLOWED HIS VICTIM TO GET WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM AND THEN SPRANG FORWARD WITH A TREMENDOUS BOUND
AND ALSO SERVE TO ILLUMINE OUR PLATEAU IN THE LONG DREARY WINTER MONTHS THERE IS NO DOUBT REPLIED ALTAMONT OF ITS UTILITY BUT HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIVE TO MAKE IT
AND THE QUESTION OF LIFE OR DEATH WOULD BE DECIDED BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER AT LAST ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALTAMONT STARTED UP WITH A SHOUT THAT ARRESTED THE WHOLE PARTY
NO DOUBT OF IT AND YET AN ESQUIMAUX MEAL MAY WELL ASTONISH US IN SIR JOHN ROSS'S NARRATIVE HE STATES HIS SURPRISE AT THE APPETITES OF HIS GUIDES HE TELLS US THAT TWO OF THEM JUST TWO MIND
LOOK AGAIN JOHNSON HE SAID THE BOATSWAIN HURRIED TO THE ONLY REMAINING PLACE HE COULD THINK OF THE HUMMOCK WHERE HE HAD STOOD TO WATCH THE BEAR BUT THE MISSING TREASURE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AND THE OLD SAILOR RETURNED IN DESPAIR HATTERAS LOOKED AT HIM
BUT FOUND NO TRACE OF HUMAN HABITATION AND INDEED SCARCELY A SIGN OF ANIMAL LIFE A FEW SNOW BIRDS HOWEVER DARTING TO AND FRO ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF SPRING AND THE RETURN OF THE ANIMAL CREATION THE SEA WAS STILL ENTIRELY FROZEN OVER
