AND A LADY WEEPING BESIDE HIM AND WHEN I SAW HER MAKING SUCH DOLE I ASKED HER WHO SLEW HER LORD SIR SHE SAID THE FALSEST KNIGHT OF THE WORLD NOW LIVING AND HE IS THE MOST VILLAIN THAT EVER MAN HEARD SPEAK OF
AND YET PITY IT WERE THAT EITHER OF THESE GOOD KNIGHTS SHOULD DESTROY OTHER'S BLOOD SO THEY STOOD AND WEPT BOTH AND MADE GREAT DOLE WHEN THEY SAW THE BRIGHT SWORDS OVER COVERED WITH BLOOD OF THEIR BODIES
WITH A COVERED SHIELD WHEN HE CAME NIGH SIR TRISTRAM HE SAID ON HIGH YE BE WELCOME SIR KNIGHT AND WELL AND TRULY HAVE YE HOLDEN YOUR PROMISE
I SHALL HEAL HIM OF HIS WOUND BY THE GRACE OF GOD WITHIN THE TERM OF SEVEN WEEKS THEN WAS SIR GALAHAD GLAD AND UNARMED HIM AND SAID HE WOULD ABIDE THERE THREE DAYS AND THEN HE ASKED SIR MELIAS HOW IT STOOD WITH HIM THEN HE SAID HE WAS TURNED UNTO HELPING
BUT THIS DUKE GALAHAD THE HAUT PRINCE WAS A NOBLE KNIGHT
I WOT WELL HE LOVED ME ABOVE ALL OTHER KNIGHTS AND THE THIRD IS HE WAS PASSING NOBLE TRUE COURTEOUS AND GENTLE AND WELL CONDITIONED THE FOURTH IS I WIST WELL ANON AS I HEARD THAT SIR GARETH WAS DEAD
BUT HE COULD FIND NO PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT ENTER THEN WAS HE PASSING HEAVY AND DISMAYED THEN HE RETURNED AND CAME TO HIS HORSE AND DID OFF HIS SADDLE AND BRIDLE AND LET HIM PASTURE AND UNLACED HIS HELM AND UNGIRT HIS SWORD
SIR SAID GALAHAD WIT YOU WELL I SHALL NOT TURN AGAIN THEN LOOKED SIR GALAHAD ON HIS ARMS THAT NOTHING FAILED HIM AND THEN HE PUT HIS SHIELD AFORE HIM AND ANON THERE MET HIM SEVEN FAIR MAIDENS THE WHICH SAID UNTO HIM
AND ON EVERY COURSER SAT A YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND ALL THEY WERE ARRAYED IN GREEN VELVET WITH SARPS OF GOLD ABOUT THEIR QUARTERS AND THE HORSE TRAPPED IN THE SAME WISE DOWN TO THE HEELS WITH MANY OUCHES
SO SIR TRISTRAM AWAKED HIM WITH THE BUTT OF HIS SPEAR AND SO THE KNIGHT ROSE UP HASTILY AND PUT HIS HELM UPON HIS HEAD AND GAT A GREAT SPEAR IN HIS HAND AND WITHOUT ANY MORE WORDS HE HURLED UNTO SIR TRISTRAM
MY LORD SIR GAWAINE SAID SIR LAUNCELOT IN THEIR QUARREL THEY PROVED THEMSELVES NOT IN THE RIGHT WELL WELL SIR LAUNCELOT SAID THE KING I HAVE GIVEN THEE NO CAUSE TO DO TO ME AS THOU HAST DONE
THEY BE NOT ABOUT YOU IT IS FOR SOME CAUSE SAID SIR GAWAINE BY MY HEAD SAID SIR KAY SIR BORS IS YONDER ALL THIS DAY UPON THE RIGHT HAND OF THIS FIELD AND THERE HE AND HIS BLOOD DO MORE WORSHIPFULLY THAN WE DO
AND THUS THEY FOUGHT THE SPACE OF FOUR HOURS THAT NEVER ONE WOULD SPEAK TO OTHER ONE WORD AND OF THEIR HARNESS THEY HAD HEWN OFF MANY PIECES
FOR THEY THAT TOLD YOU THOSE TALES WERE LIARS AND SO IT FELL UPON THEM FOR BY LIKELIHOOD HAD NOT THE MIGHT OF GOD BEEN WITH ME I MIGHT NEVER HAVE ENDURED FOURTEEN KNIGHTS AND THEY ARMED AND AFORE PURPOSED AND I UNARMED AND NOT PURPOSED
THAT IS THE GOOD AND GENTLE KNIGHT SIR LAVAINE SAID SIR BORS SO SIR LAUNCELOT ENCOUNTERED WITH SIR GAWAINE AND THERE BY FORCE SIR LAUNCELOT SMOTE DOWN SIR GAWAINE AND HIS HORSE TO THE EARTH AND SO HE SMOTE DOWN SIR AGRAVAINE AND SIR GAHERIS
AND SEEK HIM NO FURTHER FOR AT THE NEXT FEAST OF THE ROUND TABLE UPON PAIN OF MY HEAD YE SHALL FIND HIM THERE BY MY FAITH SAID SIR TRISTRAM I SHALL NEVER REST TILL THAT I FIND HIM
AND HE THAT WAS COURTEOUS TRUE AND FAITHFUL TO HIS FRIEND WAS THAT TIME CHERISHED CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE HOW TRUE LOVE IS LIKENED TO SUMMER AND THUS IT PASSED ON FROM CANDLEMASS UNTIL AFTER EASTER THAT THE MONTH OF MAY WAS COME
AND EVERY KNIGHT HELD A BRANCH OF OLIVE IN HIS HAND IN TOKENING OF PEACE AND THE QUEEN HAD FOUR AND TWENTY GENTLEWOMEN FOLLOWING HER IN THE SAME WISE AND SIR LAUNCELOT HAD TWELVE COURSERS FOLLOWING HIM
FULL WELL THOU WOTTEST I MAY NOT FIGHT WITH THEE FOR SHAME FOR THOU ART HERE NAKED AND I AM ARMED AND IF I SLAY THEE DISHONOUR SHALL BE MINE AND WELL THOU WOTTEST SAID SIR PALOMIDES TO SIR TRISTRAM I KNOW THY STRENGTH AND THY HARDINESS TO ENDURE AGAINST A GOOD KNIGHT
AND THEN HE CALLED HIMSELF A VERY WRETCH AND MOST UNHAPPY OF ALL KNIGHTS AND THERE HE SAID MY SIN AND MY WICKEDNESS HAVE BROUGHT ME UNTO GREAT DISHONOUR FOR WHEN I SOUGHT WORLDLY ADVENTURES FOR WORLDLY DESIRES I EVER ENCHIEVED THEM AND HAD THE BETTER IN EVERY PLACE
UNDER ONE STONE AND AT THAT TIME MERLIN PROPHESIED THAT IN THAT SAME PLACE SHOULD FIGHT TWO THE BEST KNIGHTS THAT EVER WERE IN ARTHUR'S DAYS AND THE BEST LOVERS SO WHEN SIR TRISTRAM CAME TO THE TOMB WHERE
SIR SAID THE GENTLEWOMAN THAT YE SEND AFTER ALL THE KNIGHTS HITHER THAT HOLD THEIR LANDS OF THIS CASTLE AND MAKE THEM TO SWEAR FOR TO USE THE CUSTOMS THAT WERE USED HERETOFORE OF OLD TIME I WILL WELL SAID GALAHAD AND THERE SHE BROUGHT HIM AN HORN OF IVORY
BY MY HEAD SAID SIR SAGRAMORE AND SIR DODINAS YE HAVE CAUSE TO DREAD HIM FOR YE SHALL FIND HIM A PASSING GOOD KNIGHT AND A VALIANT AND BECAUSE YE SHALL HAVE ADO WITH HIM WE WILL FORBEAR YOU AS AT THIS TIME
I WILL RIDE UNTO MY LORD SIR LAUNCELOT FOR TO HELP HIM FALL OF HIM WHAT FALL MAY FOR HE IS THE SAME MAN THAT MADE ME KNIGHT YE SHALL NOT SO SAID SIR BORS BY MY COUNSEL UNLESS THAT YE WERE DISGUISED YE SHALL SEE ME DISGUISED SAID SIR GARETH
AND I PROMISED HER TO BE HER WARRANT AND TO HELP HER TO INTER HER LORD AND SO SUDDENLY AS I CAME RIDING BY THIS TOWER
AND HE HAD HEARD NO MASS THE WHICH HE WAS WONT EVER TO HEAR OR EVER HE DEPARTED OUT OF ANY CASTLE OR PLACE AND KEPT THAT FOR A CUSTOM THEN SIR GALAHAD CAME UNTO A MOUNTAIN WHERE HE FOUND AN OLD CHAPEL AND FOUND THERE NOBODY
ALSO I MAY SAY YOU THE CASTLE OF MAIDENS BETOKENETH THE GOOD SOULS THAT WERE IN PRISON AFORE THE INCARNATION OF JESU CHRIST
AND TOOK THE QUEEN AND SO LED HER WHERE KING ARTHUR WAS IN HIS SEAT AND SIR GAWAINE SAT AFORE HIM AND MANY OTHER GREAT LORDS SO WHEN SIR LAUNCELOT SAW THE KING AND SIR GAWAINE THEN HE LED THE QUEEN BY THE ARM AND THEN HE KNEELED DOWN AND THE QUEEN BOTH
THAT ALL HAD PITY TO BEHOLD THEM THEN CAME DAME ELAINE AND SHE THERE MADE THEM GREAT CHEER AS MIGHT LIE IN HER POWER AND THERE SHE TOLD SIR ECTOR AND SIR PERCIVALE HOW AND IN WHAT MANNER SIR LAUNCELOT CAME INTO THAT COUNTRY AND HOW HE WAS HEALED
NOW I DREAD ME SORE SAID SIR BORS THAT MY LORD SIR LAUNCELOT WILL BE HARD MATCHED
AND THERE HE HAD ALMOST SLAIN ME AND FROM US HE TOOK HIS HORSE AND DEPARTED AND IN AN EVIL TIME WE MET WITH HIM FAIR KNIGHTS SAID SIR TRISTRAM SO HE MET WITH ME
BUT YE MUST BEWARE FOR I WARN YOU THAT KNIGHT IS WIGHT SIR SAID GALLERON I PRAY YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME AND WHAT IS THAT KNIGHT'S NAME THAT HATH BEATEN ME
IT IS NOT LONG AGO SITHEN I SMOTE YOU TO THE EARTH AT YOUR OWN REQUEST AND DESIRE I WOULD HAVE RIDDEN BY YOU BUT YE WOULD NOT SUFFER ME AND NOW MESEEMETH YE WOULD DO MORE BATTLE WITH ME
WHO HATH SLAIN YOUR LORD SIR SHE SAID HERE CAME A KNIGHT RIDING AS MY LORD AND I RESTED US HERE AND ASKED HIM OF WHENCE HE WAS
THEN SIR LAUNCELOT LOOKED BY HIM AND SAW AN OLD CHAPEL AND THERE HE WEENED TO HAVE FOUND PEOPLE AND SIR LAUNCELOT TIED HIS HORSE TILL A TREE AND THERE HE DID OFF HIS SHIELD AND HUNG IT UPON A TREE AND THEN WENT TO THE CHAPEL DOOR AND FOUND IT WASTE AND BROKEN AND WITHIN HE FOUND A FAIR ALTAR
AND MY LORD SAID OF ARTHUR'S COURT THEREFORE SAID THE STRONG KNIGHT I WILL JOUST WITH THEE
BUT YE HAVE DONE OVER MUCH FOR ME THIS DAY THAT I SHOULD FIGHT WITH YOU FOR INASMUCH AS YE HAVE SAVED MY LIFE IT WILL BE NO WORSHIP FOR YOU TO HAVE ADO WITH ME FOR YE ARE FRESH AND I AM WOUNDED SORE
AND BY FORTUNE IN A MEADOW SIR TRISTRAM MET WITH SIR KAY THE SENESCHAL AND SIR DINADAN WHAT TIDINGS WITH YOU SAID SIR TRISTRAM WITH YOU KNIGHTS NOT GOOD SAID THESE KNIGHTS
TO WHAT INTENT SAID SIR TRISTRAM FOR I WOULD WIT SAID ARTHUR SIR YE SHALL NOT WIT AS AT THIS TIME
SHE TOOK HIS SWORD AND THRUST IT THROUGH HER BODY AND BY THE CRAFT OF MERLIN
AND THEREFORE HE SUFFERED HIM TO BREATHE HIM THUS THEY FOUGHT MORE THAN TWO HOURS BUT OFTEN SIR TRISTRAM SMOTE SUCH STROKES AT SIR PALOMIDES THAT HE MADE HIM TO KNEEL AND SIR PALOMIDES BRAKE AND CUT AWAY MANY PIECES OF SIR TRISTRAM'S SHIELD
AN EVER YE ESCAPE HIS HANDS RIGHT SO SIR TRISTRAM
AND FOR THE MOST PART ALL THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE AND SO THE KING AND ALL THE COURT WERE GLAD THAT SIR PALOMIDES WAS CHRISTENED AND AT THE SAME FEAST IN CAME GALAHAD AND SAT IN THE SIEGE PERILOUS AND SO THEREWITHAL DEPARTED AND DISSEVERED ALL THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE
THEN SIR LAUNCELOT SMOTE DOWN SIR AGRAVAINE AND SIR GAHERIS AND SIR MORDRED AND SIR GARETH SMOTE DOWN SIR KAY
HERE ENDETH THE SECOND BOOK OF SIR TRISTRAM THAT WAS DRAWN OUT OF FRENCH INTO ENGLISH BUT HERE IS NO REHERSAL OF THE THIRD BOOK AND HERE FOLLOWETH THE NOBLE TALE OF THE SANGREAL THAT CALLED IS THE HOLY VESSEL
AND THEN SIR TRISTRAM SALUTED HIM AND HE WEAKLY SALUTED HIM AGAIN SIR KNIGHT SAID SIR TRISTRAM I REQUIRE YOU TELL ME YOUR RIGHT NAME SIR HE SAID MY NAME IS SIR GALLERON OF GALWAY AND KNIGHT OF THE TABLE ROUND
AND DEFENDEN YOU YE GO NO FURTHER TILL THAT THEY WIT WHAT YE WOULD FAIR SIR SAID GALAHAD I COME FOR TO DESTROY THE WICKED CUSTOM OF THIS CASTLE SIR AN YE WILL ABIDE BY THAT YE SHALL HAVE ENOUGH TO DO
SIR MELIAS SAID MY LORD GALAHAD AS SOON AS I MAY RIDE I SHALL SEEK YOU GOD SEND YOU HEALTH SAID GALAHAD AND SO TOOK HIS HORSE AND DEPARTED AND RODE MANY JOURNEYS FORWARD AND BACKWARD
AND THEREWITH HE STOOPED DOWN AND TOOK IT UP AND RODE HIS WAY WITH IT AND ANON HE SAW A KNIGHT CAME RIDING AFTER HIM THAT SAID KNIGHT SET DOWN THAT CROWN WHICH IS NOT YOURS AND THEREFORE DEFEND YOU THEN SIR MELIAS BLESSED HIM AND SAID
PULLED YOU OUT OF YOUR SADDLE AND BOUND YOU OVERTHWART AFORE HIM TO HIS SADDLE BOW AND THERE MY LORD SIR GAWAINE I RESCUED YOU AND SLEW HIM AFORE YOUR SIGHT ALSO I FOUND HIS BROTHER SIR TURQUIN
AND SO HE PROVED A GOOD KNIGHT AND AN ADVENTUROUS NOW WILL WE TURN TO OUR MATTER OF SIR LAUNCELOT IT BEFELL UPON A DAY SIR ECTOR AND SIR PERCIVALE CAME TO SIR LAUNCELOT AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WOULD DO AND WHETHER HE WOULD GO WITH THEM UNTO KING ARTHUR OR NOT
OF WHATSOMEVER DEGREE THAT HE BE EXCEPT YOUR PERSON THAT WILL SAY OR DARE SAY BUT THAT SHE IS TRUE AND CLEAN TO YOU I HERE MYSELF SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAKE WILL MAKE IT GOOD UPON HIS BODY THAT SHE IS A TRUE LADY UNTO YOU
AND GLAD I WAS EVER WHEN I FOUND ANY KNIGHT THAT MIGHT ENDURE ME ON HORSEBACK AND ON FOOT HOWBEIT SIR CARADOS OF THE DOLOROUS TOWER WAS A FULL NOBLE KNIGHT AND A PASSING STRONG MAN AND THAT WOT YE MY LORD SIR GAWAINE
AND THEN SIR PALOMIDES STOOD STILL AND BEHELD SIR TRISTRAM AND MARVELLED OF HIS WOODNESS AND OF HIS FOLLY AND THEN SIR PALOMIDES SAID TO HIMSELF AN SIR TRISTRAM WERE ARMED
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE HOW SIR LAUNCELOT BEHAVED HIM AT THE JOUSTS AND OTHER MEN ALSO
WITH THAT CAME OUT ANOTHER KNIGHT OUT OF THE LEAVES AND BRAKE A SPEAR UPON GALAHAD OR EVER HE MIGHT TURN HIM THEN GALAHAD DREW OUT HIS SWORD AND SMOTE OFF THE LEFT ARM OF HIM SO THAT IT FELL TO THE EARTH AND THEN HE FLED AND SIR GALAHAD PURSUED FAST AFTER HIM
FOR TO REQUIRE YOU TO SEEK HIM AND NOW BLESSED BE GOD SAID LA BEALE ISOUD HE IS WHOLE AND SOUND AND COME AGAIN TO THE COURT THEREOF AM I GLAD SAID SIR TRISTRAM AND NOW SHALL YE AND I MAKE US READY FOR BOTH YE AND I WILL BE AT THE FEAST
AND SO THE KING WITH THESE NINE KNIGHTS MADE THEM READY TO SET UPON SIR LAUNCELOT AND UPON SIR LAVAINE
FOR THEN EVER WILL A COWARD SHOW NO MERCY AND ALWAYS A GOOD MAN WILL DO EVER TO ANOTHER MAN AS HE WOULD BE DONE TO HIMSELF SO THEN THERE WERE GREAT FEASTS UNTO KINGS AND DUKES AND REVEL GAME AND PLAY AND ALL MANNER OF NOBLESSE WAS USED
SITHEN WE BE FLEMED BY ONE KNIGHT FROM THIS CASTLE WE SHALL DESTROY ALL THE KNIGHTS OF KING ARTHUR'S THAT WE MAY OVERCOME FOR THE LOVE OF SIR GALAHAD AND THEREWITH THE SEVEN KNIGHTS SET UPON THE THREE KNIGHTS AND BY FORTUNE SIR GAWAINE SLEW ONE OF THE BRETHREN
AND AS GOD ME BLESS THAT I SHALL SAY SHALL NOT BE SAID FOR NO FEAR THAT I HAVE OF THEE BUT THIS IS ALL WIT SIR PALOMIDES AS AT THIS TIME THOU SHOULDEST DEPART FROM ME
THAT YE HAVE SET WITH ME TO DO BATTLE FOR AS I DEEM YE WILL NOT HOLD YOUR DAY
AND WHEN HE WIST WE WERE OF ARTHUR'S COURT HE SPOKE GREAT VILLAINY BY THE KING
YEA FORSOOTH AND MY NAME IS SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAKE THAT HATH BEEN RIGHT WELL SAID OF AND NOW MY GOOD FORTUNE IS CHANGED
AND THEN SIR LAVAINE WAS HORSED AGAIN AND HE SMOTE DOWN SIR LUCAN THE BUTLER AND SIR BEDEVERE AND THEN THERE BEGAN GREAT THRONG OF GOOD KNIGHTS
FAIR KNIGHT HE SAID MY NAME IS SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAKE ALAS SAID SIR TRISTRAM WHAT HAVE I DONE FOR YE ARE THE MAN IN THE WORLD THAT I LOVE BEST
THE WHICH WAS BROUGHT INTO THIS LAND BY JOSEPH ARAMATHIE
FOR ALL ALL WAS DESOLATE AND THERE HE KNEELED TO FORE THE ALTAR AND BESOUGHT GOD OF WHOLESOME COUNSEL SO AS HE PRAYED HE HEARD A VOICE THAT SAID GO THOU NOW THOU ADVENTUROUS KNIGHT TO THE CASTLE OF MAIDENS
WE DEMANDED BATTLE OF YOU AND YET WE KNEW NOT YOUR NAME NEVERTHELESS BY SAINT CROSS SAID SIR UWAINE HE IS A STRONG KNIGHT AT MINE ADVICE AS ANY IS NOW LIVING THEN SIR TRISTRAM DEPARTED
KING ARTHUR DID PASSINGLY WELL AND SO THEREWITHAL CAME IN SIR GAWAINE AND SIR GAHERIS SIR AGRAVAINE AND SIR MORDRED
AND THEN HE WENT WITHOUT THE TOWN AND FOUND IN MIDST OF THE WAY A FIG TREE THE WHICH WAS RIGHT FAIR AND WELL GARNISHED OF LEAVES BUT FRUIT HAD IT NONE THEN OUR LORD CURSED THE TREE THAT BARE NO FRUIT THAT BETOKENETH THE FIG TREE UNTO JERUSALEM THAT HAD LEAVES AND NO FRUIT
BUT AS FOR THE QUEEN HE CONSENTED AND THEN THE BISHOP HAD OF THE KING HIS GREAT SEAL AND HIS ASSURANCE AS HE WAS A TRUE ANOINTED KING THAT SIR LAUNCELOT SHOULD COME SAFE AND GO SAFE AND THAT THE QUEEN SHOULD NOT BE SPOKEN UNTO OF THE KING
WAS WAGED BATTLE WITH HIM FOR THAT CAUSE AND AT THE FIRST RECOUNTER SAID SIR KAY
THEN THE QUEEN MADE GREAT CHEER O JESU SAID KING ARTHUR I MARVEL FOR WHAT CAUSE YE SIR LAUNCELOT WENT OUT OF YOUR MIND I AND MANY OTHERS DEEM IT WAS FOR THE LOVE OF FAIR ELAINE THE DAUGHTER OF KING PELLES BY WHOM YE ARE NOISED THAT YE HAVE GOTTEN A CHILD AND HIS NAME IS GALAHAD
THOU HAST A FAIR GRACE OF ME THIS DAY THAT I SHOULD RESCUE THEE AND THOU ART THE MAN IN THE WORLD THAT I MOST HATE BUT NOW MAKE THEE READY FOR I WILL DO BATTLE WITH THEE
AND NEVER WAS I DISCOMFIT IN NO QUARREL WERE IT RIGHT OR WRONG AND NOW I TAKE UPON ME THE ADVENTURES OF HOLY THINGS AND NOW I SEE AND UNDERSTAND THAT MINE OLD SIN HINDERETH ME AND SHAMETH ME SO THAT I HAD NO POWER TO STIR NOR SPEAK WHEN THE HOLY BLOOD APPEARED AFORE ME
NOR PRISONER I WILL NOT FAIL YOU BUT I HAVE CAUSE TO HAVE MORE DOUBT OF YOU THAT YE WILL NOT MEET WITH ME FOR YE RIDE AFTER YONDER STRONG KNIGHT AND IF YE MEET WITH HIM IT IS AN HARD ADVENTURE
FOR WHERE OVERMUCH SIN DWELLETH THERE MAY BE BUT LITTLE SWEETNESS WHEREFORE THOU ART LIKENED TO AN OLD ROTTEN TREE
KING BAN'S SON OF BENOY ALAS SAID SIR PERCIVALE WHAT HAVE I DONE I WAS SENT BY THE QUEEN FOR TO SEEK YOU AND SO I HAVE SOUGHT YOU NIGH THIS TWO YEAR AND YONDER IS SIR ECTOR DE MARIS YOUR BROTHER ABIDETH ME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE YONDER WATER
AND AT THE LAST HE CAME TO A STONY CROSS WHICH DEPARTED TWO WAYS IN WASTE LAND
WIT YOU WELL THEN WAS THERE MANY BOLD KNIGHT THERE WITH KING ARTHUR
AND SIR GAWAINE SMOTE DOWN FOUR KNIGHTS AND THEN THERE BEGAN A STRONG MEDLEY FOR THEN THERE CAME IN THE KNIGHTS OF LAUNCELOT'S BLOOD AND SIR GARETH AND SIR PALOMIDES WITH THEM
NAY SAID SIR LAUNCELOT THAT MAY NOT BE BY NO MEAN FOR I WAS SO ENTREATED AT THE COURT THAT I CAST ME NEVER TO COME THERE MORE SIR SAID SIR ECTOR I AM YOUR BROTHER AND YE ARE THE MAN IN THE WORLD THAT I LOVE MOST AND IF I UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WERE YOUR DISWORSHIP
FOR HIS SIN HE WAS THUS WOUNDED AND I MARVEL SAID THE GOOD MAN HOW YE DURST TAKE UPON YOU SO RICH A THING AS THE HIGH ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WITHOUT CLEAN CONFESSION AND THAT WAS THE CAUSE YE WERE BITTERLY WOUNDED
THEN SIR TRISTRAM HAD SO GREAT PITY OF THAT ONE KNIGHT THAT ENDURED SO GREAT PAIN
AND THESE TWO KNIGHTS MET WITH SIR TRISTRAM AND QUESTIONED WITH HIM AND ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD JOUST WITH THEM FAIR KNIGHTS SAID SIR TRISTRAM WITH A GOOD WILL I WOULD JOUST WITH YOU
AND TOOK A LITTLE HACKNEY AND RODE AFTER SIR LAUNCELOT FOR EVER HE HAD A SPY UPON HIM
AND SUDDENLY HE STRUCK ME FROM MY HORSE AND THEN OR I MIGHT RECOVER MY HORSE THIS SIR BREUSE SLEW THE DAMOSEL AND SO I TOOK MY HORSE AGAIN AND I WAS SORE ASHAMED AND SO BEGAN THE MEDLEY BETWIXT US
THEN AT THE LAST SPAKE SIR LAUNCELOT AND SAID KNIGHT THOU FIGHTEST WONDERLY WELL AS EVER I SAW KNIGHT THEREFORE AN IT PLEASE YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME SIR SAID SIR TRISTRAM THAT IS ME LOATH
AND BY THE WAY THEY MET WITH SIR UWAINE LES AVOUTRES AND THERE SIR UWAINE TOLD SIR GAWAINE HOW HE HAD MET WITH NONE ADVENTURE SITH HE DEPARTED FROM THE COURT NOR WE SAID SIR GAWAINE
TAKE HEED UNTO ME THAT I MAY BE WHOLE OF THIS MALADY AND THEREWITH ON HIS HANDS AND ON HIS KNEES HE WENT SO NIGH THAT HE TOUCHED THE HOLY VESSEL AND KISSED IT AND ANON HE WAS WHOLE AND THEN HE SAID LORD GOD I THANK THEE FOR I AM HEALED OF THIS SICKNESS
AND SIR GALAHAD THE HAUT PRINCE
THAT WHEN HE SAW A HUGUENOT COMING HE FELT HIMSELF FILLED WITH SUCH ARDENT CATHOLIC ZEAL
AND ASKED HIMSELF WHY AFTER ALL HE SHOULD NOT BE BELOVED FOR HIMSELF HE WAS ABSORBED ENTIRELY BY THE SENSATIONS OF THE MOMENT MILADY WAS NO LONGER FOR HIM THAT WOMAN OF FATAL INTENTIONS WHO HAD FOR A MOMENT TERRIFIED HIM
AS HE PASSED THE HOTEL DES GARDES HE TOOK A GLANCE IN TO THE STABLES THREE OF THE FOUR HORSES HAD ALREADY ARRIVED
LEST ONE SHOULD GIVE WAY BENEATH YOU IF YOU PASS BEFORE A HOUSE WHICH IS BEING BUILT LOOK UP FOR FEAR A STONE SHOULD FALL UPON YOUR HEAD IF YOU STAY OUT LATE BE ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY YOUR LACKEY AND LET YOUR LACKEY BE ARMED IF
BUT PRIDE BUT SELF LOVE BUT MADNESS SILENCED THIS VOICE AND STIFLED ITS MURMURS AND THEN OUR GASCON WITH THAT LARGE QUANTITY OF CONCEIT WHICH WE KNOW HE POSSESSED COMPARED HIMSELF WITH DE WARDES
HE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO ME APPROACHED THE DOOR OF THE PAVILION OPENED IT WITH A KEY HE HAD IN HIS HAND CLOSED THE DOOR AND DISAPPEARED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE OTHER TWO MEN ASCENDED THE LADDER THE LITTLE OLD MAN REMAINED AT THE COACH DOOR THE COACHMAN TOOK CARE OF HIS HORSES
IN FACT IN ADDITION TO THAT YELLOW SICKLY PALENESS WHICH INDICATES THE INSINUATION OF THE BILE IN THE BLOOD AND WHICH MIGHT BESIDES BE ACCIDENTAL
WELL SHE MUST BE AT HER COUNTRY SEAT FOR SHE HAS NOT ANSWERED ME TRULY NO SO I YESTERDAY ADDRESSED ANOTHER EPISTLE TO HER STILL MORE PRESSING THAN THE FIRST
THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
STILL FURTHER HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE WORTHY PICARD AT ONE TIME SO GREAT DIMINISHED DAY BY DAY
EVERYONE TO RETURN HOME AND WAIT FOR NEWS
AU REVOIR THE MENDICANT CONTINUED TO RIP HIS GARMENTS AND DREW FROM AMID HIS RAGS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SPANISH DOUBLE PISTOLES WHICH HE LAID DOWN ON THE TABLE
WELL I FEEL AS IF TRANSFORMED A CONFESSION WEIGHS ON MY MIND A CONFESSION IF I HAD THE LEAST DOUBT OF YOUR LOVE I WOULD NOT MAKE IT BUT YOU LOVE ME MY BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS DO YOU NOT
AND HIS HIGHNESS MONSIEUR WITH THE QUEEN THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND THE BALLET BEGAN THE KING DANCED FACING THE QUEEN AND EVERY TIME HE PASSED BY HER HE DEVOURED WITH HIS EYES THOSE STUDS OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ASCERTAIN THE NUMBER
YOU SHALL SEE IF CONFIDENCE CAN BE PLACED IN ME MOUNTED ON AN EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS TO LEAVE AT THE END OF TWENTY LEAGUES IN ORDER TO TAKE THE POST
YOU HAVE PROMISED TO BE SECRET MY GOOD MONSIEUR SAID THE OLD MAN AND I RENEW MY PROMISE BE EASY I AM A GENTLEMAN A GENTLEMAN HAS BUT HIS WORD AND I HAVE GIVEN YOU MINE WITH A HEAVY HEART D'ARTAGNAN AGAIN BENT HIS WAY TOWARD THE FERRY
EXACTLY BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT LETTERS WHICH COME IN THIS WAY INTO SHUT UP HOUSES FALL FROM HEAVEN MY FRIEND FALL FROM HEAVEN
WITHOUT ASKING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND ALIGHTED COMMENDED THE HORSES TO THE CARE OF HIS LACKEY
YOU SAID THAT PORTHOS HAD RECEIVED A SWORD CUT YES BUT HE HAS FORBIDDEN ME SO STRICTLY TO SAY SO AND WHY SO ZOUNDS MONSIEUR BECAUSE HE HAD BOASTED THAT HE WOULD PERFORATE THE STRANGER WITH WHOM YOU LEFT HIM IN DISPUTE
HIS HEART BEAT BUT NOT LIKE D'ARTAGNAN'S WITH A YOUNG AND IMPATIENT LOVE NO A MORE MATERIAL INTEREST STIRRED HIS BLOOD HE WAS ABOUT AT LAST TO PASS THAT MYSTERIOUS THRESHOLD
D'ARTAGNAN REMARKED SOMETHING PERFIDIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE PLAY OF THE WRINKLED FEATURES OF HIS COUNTENANCE A ROGUE DOES NOT LAUGH IN THE SAME WAY THAT AN HONEST MAN DOES A HYPOCRITE DOES NOT SHED THE TEARS OF A MAN OF GOOD FAITH
MONSIEUR HE CARRIED ON A TRADE WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT SATISFACTORY WHICH
MY DEAR ARAMIS YOU HAVE THE PEN OF A SECRETARY OF STATE LORD DE WINTER WILL NOW BE UPON HIS GUARD IF THE LETTER SHOULD REACH HIM AND EVEN IF IT SHOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINAL WE SHALL NOT BE COMPROMISED
IS THAT YOUR NAME MONSIEUR MY VERY OWN YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME SOMETHING YES
AND PLACES CONFIDENCE IN NOBODY BUT HIM ANY OTHER PERSON WOULD FAIL BESIDES BAZIN IS AMBITIOUS AND LEARNED BAZIN HAS READ HISTORY GENTLEMEN HE KNOWS THAT SIXTUS THE FIFTH BECAME POPE AFTER HAVING KEPT PIGS
MILADY HAD HIM ONE DAY TURNED OUT OF DOORS WITH SUNDRY BLOWS OF A GOOD STICK TO ACCELERATE HIS MOTIONS NOW PLANCHET HAS AN EXCELLENT MEMORY AND I WILL BE BOUND THAT SOONER THAN RELINQUISH ANY POSSIBLE MEANS OF VENGEANCE HE WILL ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE BEATEN TO DEATH
WHEN HE WAS LEFT STIFF AS A RUSH IN LONDON IN THE INTERVENING TIME BUCKINGHAM PERHAPS SENT HIM TO PARIS AS HE DID THE HORSES HAS ANYONE BROUGHT A LETTER FOR ME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN EAGERLY
THEN THE GLORY AND THEN THE DANGER
I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE COUNTRY AND MY FATHER IN HIS LEISURE TIME WAS SOMETHING OF A POACHER
ONLY ASK ADVICE NOT TO FOLLOW IT OR IF THEY DO FOLLOW IT IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING SOMEONE TO BLAME FOR HAVING GIVEN IT PORTHOS ARRIVED A MINUTE AFTER D'ARTAGNAN
WHY IT IS INDEED A TRUE ROYAL JEWEL
PORTHOS MADE A MOST SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE
AND TOOK FROM A BUFFET A PIECE OF CHEESE SOME PRESERVED QUINCES AND A CAKE WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF MADE OF ALMONDS AND HONEY
AN IDIOT WHO HELD THE LIFE OF LORD DE WINTER IN HIS HANDS AND DID NOT KILL HIM
NO YOU ARE AT YOUR JOURNEY'S END HOW MONSIEUR AND YOU I AM GOING A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND MONSIEUR LEAVES ME HERE ALONE YOU ARE AFRAID PLANCHET NO
IN WHICH THE WHOLE OF HIS SLENDER BODY WAS CONCEALED WAS BRISK AND DRY HIS LITTLE GRAY EYES SHONE LIKE CARBUNCLES AND APPEARED WITH HIS GRINNING MOUTH TO BE THE ONLY PART OF HIS FACE IN WHICH LIFE SURVIVED
ASKED FOR A BOTTLE OF WINE OF THE BEST QUALITY AND PLACING HIMSELF IN THE DARKEST CORNER OF THE ROOM DETERMINED THUS TO WAIT TILL DAYLIGHT BUT THIS TIME AGAIN HIS HOPES WERE DISAPPOINTED
THE PLACE NAMED BY BONACIEUX AS THAT WHICH HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF HIS JOURNEY WAS A FRESH PROOF IN SUPPORT OF THE SUSPICIONS D'ARTAGNAN HAD CONCEIVED
AND UPON A SIGN FROM HER EVERYONE EAGERLY TOOK HIS SEAT
HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
THE PALE LIGHT OF THE FIRST RAYS OF DAY GAVE TO HER CLEAR EYES A STRANGELY FRIGHTFUL EXPRESSION REALLY SAID SHE I BELIEVE YOU NOW BEGIN TO HESITATE
WELL THEN COME HERE MY DEAR SAID D'ARTAGNAN ESTABLISHING HIMSELF IN AN EASY CHAIR COME AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE THE PRETTIEST SOUBRETTE I EVER SAW AND HE DID TELL HER SO MUCH
SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE LET THEM TELL THEIR STORY OUT REPLIED MOUSQUETON THEN AS IN LEAVING THE CABARET THEY TOOK DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
D'ARTAGNAN HAS GIVEN US AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM AND THE LETTER MUST BE WRITTEN AT ONCE THE DEVIL
DECLARING THAT HE WOULD NOT RESUME THE GAME UNTIL HE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PLAY WITH THEM ON MORE EQUAL TERMS
BUT REMEMBER ALSO THAT IF BY YOUR FAULT ANY EVIL HAPPENS TO D'ARTAGNAN I WILL FIND YOU WHEREVER YOU MAY BE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RIPPING UP YOUR BELLY
THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
OH NO SAID PORTHOS IT DOES NOT EXCEED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LIVRES I EVEN THINK THAT WITH ECONOMY I COULD MANAGE IT WITH TWO THOUSAND LIVRES GOOD GOD CRIED SHE TWO THOUSAND LIVRES
IT WAS TIME MILADY HAD ALREADY RUNG HER BELL AND ROUSED THE WHOLE HOTEL
MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN YOU WILL NEVER MAKE ANYTHING BUT A VERY BAD SECRETARY WHERE YOUR LIFE WAS SPARED FOR SHAME THAT'S UNWORTHY A MAN OF SPIRIT IS NOT TO BE REMINDED OF SUCH SERVICES
SO TRIFLING INDEED THAT D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT PERCEIVE IT ANY MORE THAN HE HAD THE MOMENTARY SHADE WHICH AN INSTANT BEFORE HAD DARKENED THE COUNTENANCE OF THE WORTHY MAN AH MAY YOU BE A TRUE PROPHET SAID D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING NO
SO SO REPLIED PORTHOS ONLY THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO THE IMPERTINENT JACKANAPES GAVE ME HIS BILL AND I WAS FORCED TO TURN BOTH HIM AND HIS BILL OUT OF THE DOOR SO THAT I AM HERE
AND BY AND BY BY AND BY WE WILL SEE AH SIRE IT IS BECAUSE I CONFIDE IN THAT JUSTICE THAT I SHALL WAIT PATIENTLY AND QUIETLY THE GOOD PLEASURE OF YOUR MAJESTY
IF YOU PLEASE WE WILL JOIN OUR FRIENDS AS I AM RICH WE WILL TODAY BEGIN TO DINE TOGETHER AGAIN EXPECTING THAT YOU WILL BE RICH IN YOUR TURN MY FAITH SAID D'ARTAGNAN WITH GREAT PLEASURE
GENTLEMEN I WILL SEE THE KING THIS EVENING BUT AS TO YOU I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO RISK DOING SO THIS ADVICE WAS TOO REASONABLE AND MOREOVER CAME FROM A MAN WHO KNEW THE KING TOO WELL TO ALLOW THE FOUR YOUNG MEN TO DISPUTE IT
AT SIX IN THE EVENING THE GUESTS BEGAN TO COME AS FAST AS THEY ENTERED THEY WERE PLACED IN THE GRAND SALOON ON THE PLATFORMS PREPARED FOR THEM AT NINE O'CLOCK MADAME LA PREMIERE PRESIDENTE ARRIVED
BUT DON'T LET US HINDER YOU MOUSQUETON GO AND PERFORM YOUR MASTER'S ORDERS IS HE AT HOME YES MONSIEUR SAID MOUSQUETON BUT IN A VERY ILL HUMOR GET UP
OPENED IT WITH A FEVERISH AND TREMBLING HAND DREW FROM IT A SMALL PONIARD WITH A GOLDEN HAFT AND A SHARP THIN BLADE AND THEN THREW HERSELF WITH A BOUND UPON D'ARTAGNAN
MY COUSIN MY SISTER AND I ARE SKILLFUL IN INTERPRETING DREAMS AND EVEN ENTERTAIN GREAT FEAR OF THEM BUT OF YOURS IT MAY BE SAID I HOPE EVERY DREAM IS AN ILLUSION ADIEU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
MONSIEUR I FOLLOWED THEM FROM CURIOSITY SO THAT I SAW THE COMBAT WITHOUT THE COMBATANTS SEEING ME AND WHAT TOOK PLACE OH THE AFFAIR WAS NOT LONG I ASSURE YOU THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON GUARD
WILLINGLY SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHILE PORTHOS AND MOUSQUETON WERE BREAKFASTING WITH THE APPETITES OF CONVALESCENTS AND WITH THAT BROTHERLY CORDIALITY WHICH UNITES MEN IN MISFORTUNE D'ARTAGNAN RELATED HOW ARAMIS BEING WOUNDED WAS OBLIGED TO STOP AT CREVECOEUR
BOTH WENT INTO THE BEDROOM AND AS THE DOOR OF COMMUNICATION REMAINED OPEN
WHICH MAY BETRAY HIM WHO WEARS IT SELL THIS RING A RING WHICH COMES FROM MY SOVEREIGN NEVER SAID D'ARTAGNAN THEN AT LEAST TURN THE GEM INSIDE YOU SILLY FELLOW FOR EVERYBODY MUST BE AWARE THAT A CADET FROM GASCONY
WHEN ON COMING TO MY DOOR I FOUND THAT SOMEBODY WAS ENDEAVORING TO OPEN IT AS I AM VERY POOR AND AM NOT AFRAID OF BEING ROBBED I WENT AND OPENED THE GATE AND SAW THREE MEN AT A FEW PACES FROM IT IN THE SHADOW WAS A CARRIAGE WITH TWO HORSES AND SOME SADDLEHORSES
BUT SHE COULD NOT MARRY YOUR BROTHER BEING ALREADY MARRIED IN FRANCE AND HAVING BEEN
I WILL NEVER CONFESS THAT BUT TO THE MAN WHO SHOULD READ TO THE BOTTOM OF MY SOUL D'ARTAGNAN LOOKED AT KITTY FOR THE SECOND TIME THE YOUNG GIRL HAD FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY WHICH
THE DEVIL WHAT MUST I DO ABOVE ALL THINGS BE ALWAYS ON YOUR GUARD THE CARDINAL HAS A TENACIOUS MEMORY AND A LONG ARM YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT HE WILL REPAY YOU BY SOME ILL TURN BUT OF WHAT SORT
WHAT CONSEQUENCE CAN THE REVERSES OF FORTUNE BE TO YOU HAVE YOU NOT HAPPY ROGUE THAT YOU ARE
THE CITY CARPENTERS HAD ERECTED SCAFFOLDS UPON WHICH THE INVITED LADIES WERE TO BE PLACED THE CITY GROCER HAD ORNAMENTED THE CHAMBERS WITH TWO HUNDRED FLAMBEAUX OF WHITE WAX A PIECE OF LUXURY UNHEARD OF AT THAT PERIOD
THAT'S UNPARDONABLE IN A MAN OF YOUR AGE AND WHO BESIDES HAS SUCH A PRETTY WIFE AS YOURS OH LORD NO
SCREAMING IN A FORMIDABLE WAY AS ALL THIS HOWEVER BORE SOME RESEMBLANCE TO A DUEL D'ARTAGNAN BEGAN TO RECOVER HIMSELF LITTLE BY LITTLE WELL BEAUTIFUL LADY VERY WELL SAID HE
PERHAPS THERE IS BUT ONE AT THIS MOMENT BUT BY THIS EVENING THERE WILL BE FOUR IT APPEARS THAT OUR JOURNEY WAS A REMOUNTING JOURNEY THEN EXACTLY SO SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND NODDING TO PLANCHET HE WENT OUT
AND AS IF HE BREATHED HIS CUSTOMARY ATMOSPHERE ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY IN PARTICULAR THESE SIGNS WERE SO STRONG IN D'ARTAGNAN AND HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT THEY COULD NOT REMAIN QUIET IN ONE PLACE AND WANDERED ABOUT LIKE GHOSTS ON THE ROAD BY WHICH PLANCHET WAS EXPECTED
MADE A SIGN OF ASSENT TO D'ARTAGNAN WHO BY IT UNDERSTOOD HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO SPEAK WELL THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY SAID D'ARTAGNAN MY LORD YOUR SISTER IN LAW IS AN INFAMOUS WOMAN WHO WISHED TO HAVE YOU KILLED THAT SHE MIGHT INHERIT YOUR WEALTH
THE PERSON WHO WRITES THESE FEW LINES HAD THE HONOR OF CROSSING SWORDS WITH YOU IN THE LITTLE ENCLOSURE
FOR NOTHING HAD LED HIM TO THE EXAMINATION THAT THE GROUND TRAMPLED HERE AND HOOFMARKED THERE PRESENTED CONFUSED TRACES OF MEN AND HORSES BESIDES THE WHEELS OF A CARRIAGE WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE COME FROM PARIS HAD MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION IN THE SOFT EARTH
WENT OUT BY THE GATE OF LA CONFERENCE AND FOLLOWED THE ROAD MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL THEN THAN IT IS NOW WHICH LEADS TO SAINT CLOUD AS LONG AS HE WAS IN THE CITY PLANCHET KEPT AT THE RESPECTFUL DISTANCE HE HAD IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF
BEFORE ENTERING HIS CLOSET THE KING DESIRED TO BE INFORMED THE MOMENT THE CARDINAL ARRIVED HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE ENTRANCE OF THE KING FRESH ACCLAMATIONS WERE HEARD THESE ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF THE QUEEN
AS SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST AT LENGTH THE LIGHT DISAPPEARED WITH THIS LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED THE LAST IRRESOLUTION IN THE HEART OF D'ARTAGNAN HE RECALLED TO HIS MIND THE DETAILS OF THE FIRST NIGHT AND WITH A BEATING HEART
WAS DRAWN AND THE PALE FACE OF THE CARDINAL APPEARED HE BEING DRESSED AS A SPANISH CAVALIER HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THOSE OF THE QUEEN AND A SMILE OF TERRIBLE JOY PASSED OVER HIS LIPS THE QUEEN DID NOT WEAR HER DIAMOND STUDS
BUT I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT A BACK DOOR AND STEALING ALONG IN THE SHADE OF THE HEDGE I GAINED YONDER CLUMP OF ELDER FROM WHICH I COULD HEAR AND SEE EVERYTHING THE THREE MEN BROUGHT THE CARRIAGE UP QUIETLY AND TOOK OUT OF IT A LITTLE MAN STOUT SHORT ELDERLY
BUT LET ME BE PROPERLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUBJECT
THAT IF D'ARTAGNAN HAD NOT BEEN IN SUCH PERFECT POSSESSION OF THE FACT HE WOULD HAVE DOUBTED DO NOT LIE MY ANGEL SAID D'ARTAGNAN SMILING THAT WOULD BE USELESS WHAT DO YOU MEAN SPEAK YOU KILL ME
AT ALL EVENTS YOUNG MAN RELY UPON ONE WHO HAS BEEN THIRTY YEARS AT COURT DO NOT LULL YOURSELF IN SECURITY OR YOU WILL BE LOST BUT ON THE CONTRARY AND IT IS I WHO SAY IT SEE ENEMIES IN ALL DIRECTIONS IF ANYONE SEEKS A QUARREL WITH YOU
IN WHOSE SERVICE HE HAD A RELATIVE
THE FIRST BECAUSE BY THIS MEANS HE SHOULD ESCAPE REPROACHES RECRIMINATIONS AND PRAYERS THE SECOND BECAUSE HE WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF READING HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND ENDEAVORING IF POSSIBLE TO FATHOM THOSE OF THIS WOMAN
WELL BUT CAN'T YOU SPEAK COME MONSIEUR PORTHOS ROSE SALUTED HIS FRIENDS AND FOLLOWED MOUSQUETON AN INSTANT AFTER BAZIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE AT THE DOOR
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE JOURNEY OF ONE OF MY LADS TO PARIS
WHICH YOU ARE TAKING BACK TO HIM SAID D'ARTAGNAN
MOVED BY A DOUBLE SENTIMENT LOVE AND CURIOSITY ALL THE WAY AND IN PROPORTION AS THE CORRIDORS BECAME MORE DESERTED D'ARTAGNAN WISHED TO STOP THE YOUNG WOMAN SEIZE HER AND GAZE UPON HER WERE IT ONLY FOR A MINUTE
TO HIS EMINENCE THUS THE SOLDIERS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE RED DUKE AS ARAMIS HAD CALLED HIM OFTEN TOOK PART WITH THE KING'S MUSKETEERS IN THESE QUARRELS
SHUT HIS DOOR AND SET OFF AT A QUICK PACE IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
ARAMIS LOOK AT THAT HORSE OH THE FRIGHTFUL BRUTE SAID ARAMIS AH MY DEAR REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN UPON THAT VERY HORSE I CAME TO PARIS WHAT DOES MONSIEUR KNOW THIS HORSE
AH BUT YOU ARE JOKING MY WORTHY MAN SAID D'ARTAGNAN IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IF MY BOOTS NEED A SPONGE YOUR STOCKINGS AND SHOES STAND IN EQUAL NEED OF A BRUSH MAY YOU NOT HAVE BEEN PHILANDERING A LITTLE ALSO MONSIEUR BONACIEUX
AND BE A GOOD LAD REMEMBER IF YOU TALK IF YOU BABBLE IF YOU GET DRUNK YOU RISK YOUR MASTER'S HEAD WHO HAS SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOUR FIDELITY AND WHO ANSWERS FOR YOU
IT IS USELESS TO LET THE CARDINAL KNOW YES SIRE YOU UNDERSTAND TREVILLE AN EDICT IS STILL AN EDICT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT AFTER ALL BUT THIS ENCOUNTER SIRE IS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF A DUEL IT IS A BRAWL
THE CARDINAL WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE AND THE KING WAS VERY PALE THE KING MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD WITHOUT A MASK AND THE RIBBONS OF HIS DOUBLET SCARCELY TIED HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE QUEEN AND IN AN ALTERED VOICE SAID
AND COMMONLY DRESSED IN CLOTHES OF A DARK COLOR WHO ASCENDED THE LADDER VERY CAREFULLY LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY IN AT THE WINDOW OF THE PAVILION CAME DOWN AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD GONE UP AND WHISPERED IT IS SHE IMMEDIATELY
TO FALL INTO THE EASIEST POSITION IN HIS CORNER AND TO SLEEP WHETHER WELL OR ILL D'ARTAGNAN BE IT REMEMBERED WAS ONLY TWENTY YEARS OLD AND AT THAT AGE SLEEP HAS ITS IMPRESCRIPTIBLE RIGHTS WHICH IT IMPERIOUSLY INSISTS UPON EVEN WITH THE SADDEST HEARTS
NOW LIFTING THE GOOSEBERRY TREE BRANCHES TO LOOK AT THE FRUIT LARGE AS PLUMS WITH WHICH THEY ARE LADEN NOW TAKING A RIPE CHERRY FROM THE WALL
I NEED NOT MAKE AN ABSOLUTE FOOL OF MYSELF I KNOW ANOTHER WAY TO THE HOUSE IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY IF I KNEW TWENTY WAYS FOR HE HAS SEEN ME
ELIZA WHO WAS HEADSTRONG AND SELFISH WAS RESPECTED GEORGIANA WHO HAD A SPOILED TEMPER A VERY ACRID SPITE
CHAPTER TWO I RESISTED ALL THE WAY A NEW THING FOR ME AND A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GREATLY STRENGTHENED THE BAD OPINION BESSIE AND MISS ABBOT WERE DISPOSED TO ENTERTAIN OF ME THE FACT IS I WAS A TRIFLE BESIDE MYSELF
AND MISTER ROCHESTER LOOKED ON WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED SMILING SARDONICALLY AS IT SEEMED AT BOTH HER AND ME I HAD NOT NOTIFIED TO MISSUS FAIRFAX THE EXACT
AND IF I LET A GUST OF WIND OR A SPRINKLING OF RAIN TURN ME ASIDE FROM THESE EASY TASKS WHAT PREPARATION WOULD SUCH SLOTH BE FOR THE FUTURE I PROPOSE TO MYSELF DIANA AND MARY'S GENERAL ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WAS A SIGH
AND THOUGHTS BUSILY BENT ON DISCOVERING A MEANS OF EXTRICATION BUT HE HIMSELF LOOKED SO COMPOSED AND SO GRAVE ALSO I BECAME ASHAMED OF FEELING ANY CONFUSION
ZEALOUS IN HIS MINISTERIAL LABOURS BLAMELESS IN HIS LIFE AND HABITS HE YET DID NOT APPEAR TO ENJOY THAT MENTAL SERENITY THAT INWARD CONTENT WHICH SHOULD BE THE REWARD OF EVERY SINCERE CHRISTIAN AND PRACTICAL PHILANTHROPIST
SHE STAYED IN HER OWN ROOM HER DOOR BOLTED WITHIN FILLING TRUNKS EMPTYING DRAWERS BURNING PAPERS AND HOLDING NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANY ONE
OFTEN OF AN EVENING WHEN HE SAT AT THE WINDOW HIS DESK AND PAPERS BEFORE HIM HE WOULD CEASE READING OR WRITING REST HIS CHIN ON HIS HAND AND DELIVER HIMSELF UP TO I KNOW NOT WHAT COURSE OF THOUGHT
IT IS TO BE SURE AND WHEN YOU GET TO BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN JANE
I MIGHT SAY NEVER INDEED UNLESS WHEN A CHANCE INFLUX OF VISITORS AT GATESHEAD HALL RENDERED IT NECESSARY TO TURN TO ACCOUNT ALL THE ACCOMMODATION IT CONTAINED YET IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND STATELIEST CHAMBERS IN THE MANSION
MY HEAD STILL ACHED AND BLED WITH THE BLOW AND FALL I HAD RECEIVED NO ONE HAD REPROVED JOHN FOR WANTONLY STRIKING ME AND BECAUSE I HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM TO AVERT FARTHER IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE
I RETURNED TO MY BOOK
AND MORE EDEN LIKE IT WAS FULL OF TREES IT BLOOMED WITH FLOWERS A VERY HIGH WALL SHUT IT OUT FROM THE COURT ON ONE SIDE ON THE OTHER A BEECH AVENUE SCREENED IT FROM THE LAWN
OF HIM WHO WOULD PRESENTLY DEAL IT
DURING THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS I THOUGHT OF MISSUS REED IN HER LAST MOMENTS I SAW HER DISFIGURED AND DISCOLOURED FACE AND HEARD HER
IT IS MISTER ROCHESTER'S CIGAR I LOOK ROUND AND I LISTEN I SEE TREES LADEN WITH RIPENING FRUIT I HEAR A NIGHTINGALE
I SAY CORDIALLY GENTLEMEN I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART
NOW AT THE HOUR I ARRIVE I HAVE BUT A FIELD OR TWO TO TRAVERSE AND THEN I SHALL CROSS THE ROAD AND REACH THE GATES
BUT THE FIRST GUSH OF VIVACITY AND FLUENCY GONE I WAS FAIN TO SIT ON A STOOL AT DIANA'S FEET TO REST MY HEAD ON HER KNEE AND LISTEN ALTERNATELY TO HER AND MARY WHILE THEY SOUNDED THOROUGHLY THE TOPIC ON WHICH I HAD BUT TOUCHED
TO ONE WITH WHOM YOU HAVE NO SYMPATHY WHOM I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU TRULY LOVE FOR I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD YOU SNEER AT HER I WOULD SCORN SUCH A UNION THEREFORE I AM BETTER THAN YOU LET ME GO
BUT CONTINUALLY EVERY NERVE I HAD FEARED HIM AND EVERY MORSEL OF FLESH IN MY BONES SHRANK WHEN HE CAME NEAR THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I WAS BEWILDERED BY THE TERROR HE INSPIRED
IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF MY ABRUPT VOCAL RESPONSE BUT HE SMILED AT ME WITH A CERTAIN SMILE HE HAD OF HIS OWN
ALL LOOKED COLDER AND DARKER IN THAT VISIONARY HOLLOW THAN IN REALITY AND THE STRANGE LITTLE FIGURE THERE GAZING AT ME WITH A WHITE FACE AND ARMS SPECKING THE GLOOM
NOW STOOPING TOWARDS A KNOT OF FLOWERS EITHER TO INHALE THEIR FRAGRANCE OR TO ADMIRE THE DEW BEADS ON THEIR PETALS A GREAT MOTH GOES HUMMING BY ME
AND IN SPITE OF ME THANK YOU MISTER ROCHESTER FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS I AM STRANGELY GLAD TO GET BACK AGAIN TO YOU AND WHEREVER YOU ARE IS MY HOME
AND IF THAT BOISTEROUS CHANNEL AND TWO HUNDRED MILES OR SO OF LAND COME BROAD BETWEEN US I AM AFRAID THAT CORD OF COMMUNION WILL BE SNAPT AND THEN
I STEP ASIDE INTO THE IVY RECESS HE WILL NOT STAY LONG HE WILL SOON RETURN WHENCE HE CAME AND IF I SIT STILL HE WILL NEVER SEE ME BUT NO
THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY WE HAD BEEN WANDERING INDEED IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING BUT SINCE DINNER MISSUS REED WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY DINED EARLY THE COLD WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT
JANET SAID HE MAKING ROOM FOR ME TO CROSS THE STILE GO UP HOME AND STAY YOUR WEARY LITTLE WANDERING FEET AT A FRIEND'S THRESHOLD
HE IS FLOWN THE MOTH ROAMED AWAY I WAS SHEEPISHLY RETREATING ALSO BUT MISTER ROCHESTER FOLLOWED ME AND WHEN WE REACHED THE WICKET HE SAID TURN BACK
DEVELOPED FOR ME IN THESE REGIONS THE SAME ATTRACTION AS FOR THEM WOUND ROUND MY FACULTIES THE SAME SPELL THAT ENTRANCED THEIRS INDOORS WE AGREED EQUALLY WELL
HERE IS THE BENCH AT ITS OLD ROOTS COME WE WILL SIT THERE IN PEACE TO NIGHT THOUGH WE SHOULD NEVER MORE BE DESTINED TO SIT THERE TOGETHER HE SEATED ME
I LEFT REMINISCENCE FOR ANTICIPATION I WAS GOING BACK TO THORNFIELD BUT HOW LONG WAS I TO STAY THERE NOT LONG OF THAT I WAS SURE
I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD TREMBLE IN THIS WAY WHEN I SAW HIM OR LOSE MY VOICE OR THE POWER OF MOTION IN HIS PRESENCE I WILL GO BACK AS SOON AS I CAN STIR
AND SO NO DOUBT SHE FELT IT I WAS A PRECOCIOUS ACTRESS IN HER EYES SHE SINCERELY LOOKED ON ME AS A COMPOUND OF VIRULENT PASSIONS MEAN SPIRIT AND DANGEROUS DUPLICITY BESSIE AND ABBOT HAVING RETREATED
AND AID THEM WHEN AND WHERE THEY WOULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A REVIVING PLEASURE IN THIS INTERCOURSE OF A KIND NOW TASTED BY ME FOR THE FIRST TIME
CUSTOM INTERVENED BETWEEN ME AND WHAT I NATURALLY AND INEVITABLY LOVED IT IS A LONG WAY I AGAIN SAID
EVENTIDE IS AS PLEASANT TO HIM AS TO ME AND THIS ANTIQUE GARDEN AS ATTRACTIVE AND HE STROLLS ON
AND MEANT TO LEAVE HIM CALMLY AN IMPULSE HELD ME FAST A FORCE TURNED ME ROUND I SAID OR SOMETHING IN ME SAID FOR ME
NOR ATTEMPTED TO DISSUADE HER FROM IT THE VOCATION WILL FIT YOU TO A HAIR I THOUGHT MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO YOU WHEN WE PARTED SHE SAID GOOD BYE COUSIN JANE EYRE I WISH YOU WELL
AN HONOUR IS AWARDED WHERE IT IS NOT MERITED AND CONSEQUENTLY DENIED WHERE IT IS JUSTLY DUE
BUT THE MOTHER'S HEART TURNED FROM AN OPINION SO HARSH
THEN I MUST GO YOU HAVE SAID IT YOURSELF NO YOU MUST STAY I SWEAR IT AND THE OATH SHALL BE KEPT
HE WAS STANDING AMONG THE BEDS AT A YARD OR TWO DISTANT FROM WHERE I HAD TO PASS THE MOTH APPARENTLY ENGAGED HIM I SHALL GET BY VERY WELL I MEDITATED
AGAINST THE VOICE THAT KEPT WARNING ME OF NEAR SEPARATION AND COMING GRIEF
WHAT THE DEUCE HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOURSELF THIS LAST MONTH I HAVE BEEN WITH MY AUNT SIR WHO IS DEAD
THE HAY WAS ALL GOT IN THE FIELDS ROUND THORNFIELD WERE GREEN AND SHORN THE ROADS WHITE AND BAKED THE TREES WERE IN THEIR DARK PRIME HEDGE AND WOOD
JUST AS IF BOTH HAD PASSED THROUGH THE GRAVE AND WE STOOD AT GOD'S FEET EQUAL AS WE ARE AS WE ARE
WHEN I DID SPEAK IT WAS ONLY TO EXPRESS AN IMPETUOUS WISH THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN BORN OR NEVER COME TO THORNFIELD BECAUSE YOU ARE SORRY TO LEAVE IT
AND FOR THE LOOK YOU HAD IN YOUR EYES TWO MINUTES SINCE YOU RAT
NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
HOW PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY ARE RETURNING HOME FROM AN ABSENCE LONG OR SHORT I DID NOT KNOW I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE SENSATION
I REALLY SAW IN HIM A TYRANT A MURDERER I FELT A DROP OR TWO OF BLOOD FROM MY HEAD TRICKLE DOWN MY NECK AND WAS SENSIBLE OF SOMEWHAT PUNGENT SUFFERING THESE SENSATIONS FOR THE TIME PREDOMINATED OVER FEAR AND I RECEIVED HIM IN FRANTIC SORT
EVEN SINGLY OUR WAVE GIRT LAND
MISSUS REED IMPATIENT OF MY NOW FRANTIC ANGUISH AND WILD SOBS ABRUPTLY THRUST ME BACK AND LOCKED ME IN WITHOUT FARTHER PARLEY I HEARD HER SWEEPING AWAY AND SOON AFTER SHE WAS GONE I SUPPOSE I HAD A SPECIES OF FIT
HOWEVER IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS AND SO IT SUITS YOU I DON'T MUCH CARE YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT SAID SHE AND WITH THESE WORDS WE EACH WENT OUR SEPARATE WAY
AND APPRECIATED ONLY THEIR ACQUIRED ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS THEY APPRECIATED THE SKILL OF THEIR COOK OR THE TASTE OF THEIR WAITING WOMAN
WHAT DOES BESSIE SAY I HAVE DONE I ASKED JANE I DON'T LIKE CAVILLERS OR QUESTIONERS BESIDES THERE IS SOMETHING TRULY FORBIDDING IN A CHILD TAKING UP HER ELDERS IN THAT MANNER
ALL SAID I WAS WICKED AND PERHAPS I MIGHT BE SO
I HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THESE WORDS THEY WERE NOT NEW TO ME MY VERY FIRST RECOLLECTIONS OF EXISTENCE INCLUDED HINTS OF THE SAME KIND THIS REPROACH OF MY DEPENDENCE HAD BECOME A VAGUE SING SONG IN MY EAR
YOU HAVE SOME SENSE I THEN RETURNED YOU ARE NOT WITHOUT SENSE COUSIN ELIZA BUT WHAT YOU HAVE I SUPPOSE IN ANOTHER YEAR WILL BE WALLED UP ALIVE IN A FRENCH CONVENT
I WIPED MY TEARS AND HUSHED MY SOBS FEARFUL LEST ANY SIGN OF VIOLENT GRIEF MIGHT WAKEN A PRETERNATURAL VOICE TO COMFORT ME OR ELICIT FROM THE GLOOM SOME HALOED FACE BENDING OVER ME WITH STRANGE PITY
SHE WISHED ME TO LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE TO SEE CALLERS AND ANSWER NOTES OF CONDOLENCE
WHICH IS SUCH THAT I HAVE MADE IT MY LAW OF ACTION ADELE MUST GO TO SCHOOL AND YOU MISS EYRE MUST GET A NEW SITUATION YES SIR
AND IN THOSE LAST WORDS LIES THE SECRET OF THE RED ROOM THE SPELL WHICH KEPT IT SO LONELY IN SPITE OF ITS GRANDEUR MISTER REED HAD BEEN DEAD NINE YEARS IT WAS IN THIS CHAMBER HE BREATHED HIS LAST
ONCE SHE SAID SHE HAD ACTUALLY PUT THE QUESTION TO MISTER ROCHESTER AS TO WHEN HE WAS GOING TO BRING HIS BRIDE HOME BUT HE HAD ANSWERED HER
STOOD OUT LIKE A TABERNACLE IN THE CENTRE THE TWO LARGE WINDOWS WITH THEIR BLINDS ALWAYS DRAWN DOWN WERE HALF SHROUDED IN FESTOONS AND FALLS OF SIMILAR DRAPERY THE CARPET WAS RED THE TABLE AT THE FOOT OF THE BED WAS COVERED WITH A CRIMSON CLOTH
IT WAS NOT A BRIGHT OR SPLENDID SUMMER EVENING THOUGH FAIR AND SOFT THE HAYMAKERS WERE AT WORK ALL ALONG THE ROAD AND THE SKY THOUGH FAR FROM CLOUDLESS
BUT IN THREADING THE FLOWER AND FRUIT PARTERRES AT THE UPPER PART OF THE ENCLOSURE ENTICED THERE BY THE LIGHT THE NOW RISING MOON CAST ON THIS MORE OPEN QUARTER MY STEP
SCARCELY LESS PROMINENT WAS AN AMPLE CUSHIONED EASY CHAIR NEAR THE HEAD OF THE BED ALSO WHITE WITH A FOOTSTOOL BEFORE IT AND LOOKING AS I THOUGHT LIKE A PALE THRONE THIS ROOM WAS CHILL BECAUSE IT SELDOM HAD A FIRE
THEY CLUNG TO THE PURPLE MOORS BEHIND AND AROUND THEIR DWELLING TO THE HOLLOW VALE INTO WHICH THE PEBBLY BRIDLE PATH LEADING FROM THEIR GATE DESCENDED AND WHICH WOUND BETWEEN FERN BANKS FIRST AND THEN AMONGST A FEW OF THE WILDEST LITTLE PASTURE FIELDS
AND ADDED THAT HE SAW ADELE WAS PRETE A
THAT I CONSENT THUS TO RENDER IT SO PATIENT AND COMPLIANT ON MY PART AT LAST I SAW GEORGIANA OFF
YOU HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK OF ME HE SAID YES I WISH TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE HEARD OF ANY SERVICE I CAN OFFER MYSELF TO UNDERTAKE I FOUND OR DEVISED SOMETHING FOR YOU THREE WEEKS AGO BUT AS YOU SEEMED BOTH USEFUL AND HAPPY HERE
THE PILED UP MATTRESSES AND PILLOWS OF THE BED
BE SEATED SOMEWHERE AND UNTIL YOU CAN SPEAK PLEASANTLY REMAIN SILENT A BREAKFAST ROOM ADJOINED THE DRAWING ROOM I SLIPPED IN THERE IT CONTAINED A BOOKCASE I SOON POSSESSED MYSELF OF A VOLUME
AND WHAT A SCREAM
ALWAYS ACCUSED FOR EVER CONDEMNED WHY COULD I NEVER PLEASE
THAT HE WAS SO SOON TO CEASE TO BE MY MASTER
ALL HIS MOTHER'S AVERSION ALL THE SERVANTS PARTIALITY TURNED UP IN MY DISTURBED MIND LIKE A DARK DEPOSIT IN A TURBID WELL WHY WAS I ALWAYS SUFFERING ALWAYS BROWBEATEN
AND SOME MINUTES OF APPARENTLY MOURNFUL MEDITATION BUT BESIDES HIS FREQUENT ABSENCES THERE WAS ANOTHER BARRIER TO FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM HE SEEMED OF A RESERVED AN ABSTRACTED AND EVEN OF A BROODING NATURE
ONE OF CLOSE AND ANXIOUS INTEREST TO ME WHAT IS THE EMPLOYMENT YOU HAD IN VIEW MISTER RIVERS I HOPE THIS DELAY WILL NOT HAVE INCREASED THE DIFFICULTY OF SECURING IT
I SHOULD ASSIGN YOU YOUR SHARE OF LABOUR AND COMPEL YOU TO ACCOMPLISH IT OR ELSE IT SHOULD BE LEFT UNDONE
DEAD AND TELLS ME SO WHEN SHE MEETS ME ALONE HERE IN THE GLOAMING IF I DARED I'D TOUCH YOU TO SEE IF YOU ARE SUBSTANCE OR SHADOW YOU ELF
WHERE YOU SIR HAVE PLACED IT BEFORE ME IN WHAT SHAPE IN THE SHAPE OF MISS INGRAM A NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YOUR BRIDE MY BRIDE
HOW FULL THE HEDGES ARE OF ROSES BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO GATHER ANY I WANT TO BE AT THE HOUSE I PASSED A TALL BRIAR SHOOTING LEAFY AND FLOWERY BRANCHES ACROSS THE PATH
AND HE WAS STILL HER OWN DARLING I DARED COMMIT NO FAULT
MISSUS FAIRFAX WILL SMILE YOU A CALM WELCOME TO BE SURE SAID I AND LITTLE ADELE WILL CLAP HER HANDS AND JUMP TO SEE YOU
THEIR TWO PAIR OF HANDS ARRESTED ME INSTANTLY IF YOU DON'T SIT STILL YOU MUST BE TIED DOWN SAID BESSIE
IT BEGAN CALM AND INDEED AS FAR AS DELIVERY AND PITCH OF VOICE WENT IT WAS CALM TO THE END AN EARNESTLY FELT YET STRICTLY RESTRAINED ZEAL BREATHED SOON IN THE DISTINCT ACCENTS AND PROMPTED THE NERVOUS LANGUAGE
AT THIS MOMENT A LIGHT GLEAMED ON THE WALL WAS IT I ASKED MYSELF A RAY FROM THE MOON PENETRATING SOME APERTURE IN THE BLIND NO MOONLIGHT WAS STILL AND THIS STIRRED
WHEN I HEARD HIM PREACH IN HIS OWN CHURCH AT MORTON I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE THAT SERMON BUT IT IS PAST MY POWER I CANNOT EVEN RENDER FAITHFULLY THE EFFECT IT PRODUCED ON ME
WAS SUCH AS PROMISED WELL FOR THE FUTURE ITS BLUE WHERE BLUE WAS VISIBLE WAS MILD AND SETTLED AND ITS CLOUD STRATA HIGH AND THIN
AND THEIR GAZE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE HORIZON OF WHICH TWO THIRDS OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE WERE VISIBLE FOR THE LAST TIME THE ENGINEER COULD ASCERTAIN THAT NOT A SAIL NOR THE WRECK OF A SHIP WAS ON THE SEA AND EVEN WITH THE TELESCOPE NOTHING SUSPICIOUS COULD BE DISCOVERED
IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING IF WE TRIED THE RANGE OF OUR GUNS DO YOU THINK THAT IS USEFUL ASKED THE ENGINEER IT IS MORE THAN USEFUL IT IS NECESSARY WITHOUT THAT HOW ARE WE TO KNOW TO WHAT DISTANCE WE CAN SEND ONE OF THOSE PRETTY SHOT WITH WHICH WE ARE PROVIDED
WHO KNEW WHEN TO BE SILENT RAN IN ADVANCE THE CART CAME OUT THE GATE WAS RECLOSED AND THE ONAGER LED BY PENCROFT ADVANCED AT A SLOW PACE CERTAINLY
NO MY DEAR SPILETT BUT YOU SEE THAT IF IT IS CERTAIN THAT A HUMAN BEING SET FOOT ON THE ISLAND IT APPEARS NO LESS CERTAIN THAT HE HAS NOW LEFT IT THEN IF I UNDERSTAND YOU RIGHT CAPTAIN SAID HERBERT THE VESSEL HAS LEFT AGAIN
EXHAUSTED WITH FATIGUE DYING OF HUNGER HE HAD NOT STRENGTH TO UTTER A WORD
WHO DID NOT HAZARD THIS SHAMEFUL SUPPOSITION WITHOUT HESITATING PENCROFT SAID HARDING TAKING THE SAILOR'S ARM THAT IS A WICKED IDEA OF YOURS AND YOU WILL DISTRESS ME MUCH IF YOU PERSIST IN SPEAKING THUS
NEARLY TWO FEET AND A HALF LONG
BUT AT THAT MOMENT WHEN HE GAVE IT A PULL TO BRING DOWN THE LADDER AN ARM THRUST SUDDENLY OUT BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE DOOR
AFTER ALL THE ISLAND WAS LARGE AND FERTILE IF ANY SENTIMENT OF HONESTY YET REMAINED IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEARTS THESE WRETCHES MIGHT PERHAPS BE RECLAIMED WAS IT NOT THEIR INTEREST IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE
AS THOSE WHICH ARE EMITTED FROM FLINT WHEN STRUCK IN THE SAME MANNER THE EXPERIMENT THEREFORE DID NOT SUCCEED PENCROFT ALTHOUGH HE HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCEEDING THEN TRIED RUBBING TWO PIECES OF DRY WOOD TOGETHER AS SAVAGES DO
IT WAS OF IMPORTANCE THAT THIS TREASURE SHOULD NOT BE LEFT LONGER EXPOSED TO THE MERCIES OF THE FIRST STORM THE SETTLERS UNITING THEIR EFFORTS MANAGED TO DRAG IT AS FAR AS THE SHORE WHERE THEY DISCOVERED A LARGE ROCKY CAVITY
WHY THESE APES ARE SO CUNNING RETURNED PENCROFT THEY WON'T SHOW THEMSELVES AGAIN AT THE WINDOWS AND SO WE CAN'T KILL THEM AND WHEN I THINK OF THE MISCHIEF THEY MAY DO IN THE ROOMS AND STOREHOUSE HAVE PATIENCE REPLIED HARDING
ABOUT THIRTY MILES REPLIED THE ENGINEER IF WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CURVINGS OF THE COAST THIRTY MILES RETURNED SPILETT THAT WOULD BE A LONG DAY'S MARCH NEVERTHELESS I THINK THAT WE SHOULD RETURN TO GRANITE HOUSE BY THE SOUTH COAST
LOOK HERE WE WILL BUILD A CRAFT OF SOME TWENTY TONS AND THEN WE CAN MAKE A MAIN SAIL A FORESAIL AND A JIB OUT OF THAT CLOTH AS TO THE REST OF IT THAT WILL HELP TO DRESS US WE SHALL SEE PENCROFT REPLIED CYRUS HARDING WE SHALL SEE
HE WAS ROAMING ABOUT THE SHORE HE WAS LIKE A BODY WITHOUT A SOUL PENCROFT KNEW FIFTY WAYS OF COOKING EGGS BUT THIS TIME HE HAD NO CHOICE AND WAS OBLIGED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH ROASTING THEM UNDER THE HOT CINDERS IN A FEW MINUTES THE COOKING WAS DONE
AND I HOPE HE WILL MAKE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT ADDED HERBERT HE APPEARS YOUNG AND WILL BE EASY TO EDUCATE AND WE SHALL NOT BE OBLIGED TO USE FORCE TO SUBDUE HIM NOR DRAW HIS TEETH AS IS SOMETIMES DONE HE WILL SOON GROW FOND OF HIS MASTERS IF THEY ARE KIND TO HIM AND THEY WILL BE
THERE HE FOUND A CONVICT WHO AIMING AT HIM SENT A BALL THROUGH HIS HAT IN A FEW SECONDS BEFORE HE HAD EVEN TIME TO FIRE HIS SECOND BARREL HE FELL STRUCK TO THE HEART BY HARDING'S DAGGER MORE SURE EVEN THAN HIS GUN DURING THIS TIME
THEY WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN THE LADDER TO THE GROUND AND SO RE ESTABLISH THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BEACH AND GRANITE HOUSE THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE AND WITH A LITTLE SKILL THIS METHOD MIGHT SUCCEED VERY FORTUNATELY
AND JUDGING BY THE HEIGHT OF THE SUN THAT IT WAS ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK HE GAVE THE SIGNAL TO RETURN TOP'S INSTINCT WAS USEFUL TO THE HUNTERS WHO THANKS TO THE INTELLIGENT ANIMAL WERE ENABLED TO DISCOVER THE ROAD BY WHICH THEY HAD COME
WHAT HIS OBJECT CAN BE IN ACTING THUS IN CONCEALING HIMSELF AFTER RENDERING US SO MANY SERVICES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND BUT HIS SERVICES ARE NOT THE LESS REAL
WHICH BAFFLED EVEN THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND EXPERIENCE IT IS A JOKE SAID PENCROFT IT IS A TRICK SOME ONE HAS PLAYED US WELL I DON'T LIKE SUCH JOKES AND THE JOKER HAD BETTER LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF IF HE FALLS INTO MY HANDS I CAN TELL HIM
HE MUST NOT COME RETURNED CYRUS HARDING QUICKLY HE WOULD BE MURDERED ON THE ROAD IT IS VERY PROBABLE HOWEVER THAT HE WILL ATTEMPT TO REJOIN US AH IF THE TELEGRAPH STILL ACTED HE MIGHT BE WARNED BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOW
THEY NOW HAD ONLY TO MAKE A FIREPLACE AND TO PREPARE THE SUPPER AN EASY TASK
BEFORE THIS CLEAR CRACKLING FIRE ON THE DRY SAND WHAT THANKSGIVING MUST THEY HAVE RENDERED TO HEAVEN BUT THE MOST INGENIOUS THE MOST LEARNED HE WHO WAS THEIR UNQUESTIONED CHIEF CYRUS HARDING WAS ALAS MISSING
WHO CAN THE GENTLEMAN HAVE BEEN WHO SENT US THAT DOWN
BUT HE REFUSED THEM HE COULD NOT WOULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT HIS MASTER AS TO GIDEON SPILETT HE DEVOURED THE SHELL FISH THEN HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON THE SAND AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK HE WAS VERY WEAK BUT CALM HERBERT WENT UP TO HIM AND TAKING HIS HAND
THE MOST EFFICACIOUS THERAPEUTIC AGENT IN GRAVE CASES AND THE ONE WHICH IS NOW ADOPTED BY ALL PHYSICIANS COLD WATER HAS MOREOVER THE ADVANTAGE OF LEAVING THE WOUND IN ABSOLUTE REST AND PRESERVING IT FROM ALL PREMATURE DRESSING A CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE
OH I CAN DO NO MORE HE MURMURED
TOP SPRANG FORWARDS THEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED HE WILL GET THERE SAID THE REPORTER YES AND HE WILL COME BACK THE FAITHFUL ANIMAL WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT ASKED GIDEON SPILETT TEN
THERE THEY ARE SLEEPING QUIETLY AS IF THEY WERE IN THEIR OWN HOUSE HALLO THERE YOU PIRATES BRIGANDS ROBBERS SONS OF JOHN BULL WHEN PENCROFT BEING A YANKEE TREATED ANY ONE TO THE EPITHET OF SON OF JOHN BULL
WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN DIRECTLY OR ANY OF HER MASTS AND SPARS WOULD HAVE BEEN WASHED ON SHORE JUST AS THE CHEST HAD BEEN WHICH WAS FOUND TWENTY MILES FROM HERE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TOWARDS THREE O'CLOCK
HE SEIZED IT WITH HIS FINGERS THROUGH THE STUFF BUT HE COULD NOT GET IT OUT IF THIS WAS A MATCH AND A SINGLE ONE IT WAS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT TO RUB OFF THE PHOSPHORUS WILL YOU LET ME TRY SAID THE BOY AND VERY CLEVERLY WITHOUT BREAKING IT
WE WILL SEARCH INTO ITS MOST SECRET RECESSES AND WILL HOPE THAT OUR UNKNOWN FRIEND WILL PARDON US IN CONSIDERATION OF OUR INTENTIONS FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE COLONISTS WERE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED IN HAYMAKING AND THE HARVEST
THAT WAS NOT IMAGINARY I SUPPOSE HANG IT NO EXCLAIMED PENCROFT THINKING OF HIS ABSENT TOOTH THEN WHAT CONCLUSION MAY BE DRAWN ASKED THE REPORTER THIS
THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO REACH GRANITE HOUSE TO EAT AND SLEEP AND IF THE BRIDGE HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN AT HOME THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK PENCROFT PREPARED TO KEEP HIS PROMISE BY CONSTRUCTING A SORT OF RAFT ON WHICH TO MAKE THE PASSAGE OF THE MERCY
TURNING TO HIS COMPANION AYRTON HESITATED AT FIRST TO REPLY AND CYRUS HARDING REGRETTED THAT PENCROFT HAD SO THOUGHTLESSLY PUT THIS QUESTION AND HE WAS MUCH MOVED WHEN AYRTON REPLIED IN A HUMBLE TONE
EXCLAIMED WHAT IS FLOATING THERE PENCROFT STOPPED WORKING AND SEEING AN INDISTINCT OBJECT MOVING THROUGH THE GLOOM A CANOE CRIED HE
GIDEON SPILETT AND THE SAILOR HOISTED THEMSELVES OVER THE PALISADE LEAPED INTO THE ENCLOSURE THREW DOWN THE PROPS WHICH SUPPORTED THE INNER DOOR RAN INTO THE EMPTY HOUSE AND SOON POOR HERBERT WAS LYING ON AYRTON'S BED IN A FEW MOMENTS HARDING WAS BY HIS SIDE
THEN HIS ABORTIVE ATTEMPT TO PROCURE FIRE IN THE SAVAGES WAY WE SHALL CONSIDER REPLIED THE ENGINEER AND IF WE DO NOT FIND SOME SUBSTANCE SIMILAR TO TINDER WELL ASKED THE SAILOR
AN HOUR AFTER FOUR OUT OF THE FIVE MILES HAD BEEN CLEARED WITHOUT ANY INCIDENT HAVING OCCURRED THE ROAD WAS AS DESERTED AS ALL THAT PART OF THE JACAMAR WOOD WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE MERCY AND THE LAKE
IT MAY JUST AS WELL STAY THERE TWO DAYS AS YET WE HAVE HAD NO REASON TO THINK THAT THE ISLAND IS INFESTED BY THIEVES YET SAID THE SAILOR WHEN I REMEMBER THE HISTORY OF THE TURTLE I AM FAR FROM CONFIDENT OF THAT
WHICH STILL REMAINED ALMOST DRY THE DEEP SLEEP WHICH HAD OVERPOWERED HIM WOULD NO DOUBT BE MORE BENEFICIAL TO HIM THAN ANY NOURISHMENT NIGHT HAD CLOSED IN AND THE TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD MODIFIED WHEN THE WIND SHIFTED TO THE NORTHWEST
OF COURSE MY BOY REPLIED PENCROFT SO WOULD I AND ALL OF US I AM NOT INQUISITIVE BUT I WOULD GIVE ONE OF MY EYES TO SEE THIS INDIVIDUAL FACE TO FACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE MUST BE HANDSOME TALL STRONG WITH A SPLENDID BEARD RADIANT HAIR
ISLAND OR CONTINENT THIS WAS HIS UPPERMOST THOUGHT WELL REPLIED PENCROFT
ALAS WE HAVE NO FIRE SAID PENCROFT OR RATHER CAPTAIN WE HAVE IT NO LONGER AND THE SAILOR RECOUNTED ALL THAT HAD PASSED THE DAY BEFORE HE AMUSED THE ENGINEER BY THE HISTORY OF THE SINGLE MATCH
LET'S RUN TO THE PLACE WHERE WE LANDED IT WAS SCARCELY PROBABLE THAT THEY WOULD FIND THE BOX WHICH THE WAVES HAD ROLLED ABOUT AMONG THE PEBBLES AT HIGH TIDE BUT IT WAS AS WELL TO TRY HERBERT AND PENCROFT WALKED RAPIDLY TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAD LANDED THE DAY BEFORE
PENCROFT WAS NOT MISTAKEN AND HE GAVE VENT TO HIS FEELINGS IN A TREMENDOUS HURRAH ADDING THERE IS GOOD CLOTH THERE IS WHAT WILL FURNISH US WITH LINEN FOR YEARS THERE IS WHAT WILL MAKE US HANDKERCHIEFS AND SHIRTS HA HA MISTER SPILETT
I BEG YOUR PARDON RETURNED PENCROFT
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO SEIZE IT BEFORE THE RAPID CURRENT SHOULD HAVE SWEPT IT AWAY OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER
TRY THEM PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER HOWEVER I THINK THAT IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENT WE OUGHT TO EMPLOY
IT WAS CERTAINLY A LUCKY CIRCUMSTANCE FOR THE SETTLERS IN LINCOLN ISLAND THAT THE BALLOON AFTER HAVING MADE ITS LAST BOUND INTO THE AIR HAD FALLEN ON THE ISLAND AND THUS GIVEN THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF FINDING IT AGAIN
FOR ANY IMPRUDENCE MIGHT INVOLVE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES BUT HIS CONVALESCENCE IS PROGRESSING AND IF HE CONTINUES TO GAIN STRENGTH IN EIGHT DAYS FROM NOW WELL WE SHALL SEE EIGHT DAYS
AND THAT THE SETTLERS WOULD HAVE ALL THEIR WORK TO DO OVER AGAIN FRESH WEAPONS AND TOOLS TO MAKE WAS A SERIOUS MATTER THEIR UNEASINESS LED ONE OR OTHER OF THEM ALSO TO GO OUT EVERY FEW MINUTES TO SEE IF TOP WAS KEEPING GOOD WATCH
TOP RUNNING AMONG THE GRASS OR IN THE WOOD WOULD PASS UNPERCEIVED THE ENGINEER WENT TO THE GATE OF THE CORRAL AND OPENED IT
THAT WOULD HAVE SPARED US ALL THESE MISFORTUNES YES ANSWERED THE REPORTER BUT NOW WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE MERCILESS AT ANY RATE SAID THE ENGINEER WE ARE OBLIGED TO WAIT SOME TIME AND TO REMAIN AT THE CORRAL UNTIL WE CAN CARRY HERBERT WITHOUT DANGER TO GRANITE HOUSE
AND STILL MORE SO THE REPORTER HOWEVER HE KNEW ONE THING THIS WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PREVENT THE INFLAMMATORY STRANGULATION OF THE INJURED PARTS THEN TO CONTEND WITH THE LOCAL INFLAMMATION AND FEVER WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM THE WOUND PERHAPS MORTAL
OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL OF THE SAME NATURE THAT THE WATER OF THE CHANNEL HAD BEEN RAISED LIKE A DOME THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIG CRUSHED IN AND SHE HAD SUNK INSTANTLY THE DAMAGE DONE TO HER HULL
OF FOLIAGE ALL HERE WAS IN ORDER BUT A CRY ESCAPED THE COLONISTS WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE DOOR WHICH THEY HAD CLOSED ON THEIR DEPARTURE WAS NOW WIDE OPEN SOME ONE HAD ENTERED GRANITE HOUSE THERE COULD BE NO MORE DOUBT ABOUT THAT THE UPPER LADDER
FROM THE HANDS OF THE VILLAINS AND THIS WOULD BE A POWERFUL AID TO THE SETTLERS AT ANY RATE OBSERVED GIDEON SPILETT IF HAPPILY AYRTON DID MANAGE TO ESCAPE HE WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO GRANITE HOUSE
IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE FOUR CANNONS WERE IN PERFECT ORDER SINCE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE WATER THE SAILOR HAD BESTOWED GREAT CARE UPON THEM HOW MANY HOURS HE HAD SPENT IN RUBBING GREASING AND POLISHING THEM AND IN CLEANING THE MECHANISM
THEY WERE RETURNING ALONE THE BOY'S HEART SANK THE SAILOR HAD NOT BEEN DECEIVED IN HIS FOREBODINGS THE ENGINEER CYRUS HARDING HAD NOT BEEN FOUND THE REPORTER ON HIS ARRIVAL SAT DOWN ON A ROCK WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING
ON WHICH HE DID NOT SPARE FUEL BUT ONE OF THE CASTAWAYS DID NOT SLEEP IN THE CAVE
THEY AS YET SAW NO SIGNS OF ANY HUMAN BEING HAVING PASSED THAT WAY SHRUBS AND CREEPERS WERE UNINJURED AND THEY HAD EVEN TO CUT THEM AWAY WITH THE AXE AS THEY HAD DONE IN THE DEEPEST RECESSES OF THE FOREST IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FANCY THAT ANY HUMAN CREATURE HAD EVER PASSED THERE
PENCROFT THINK OF AYRTON SAID HERBERT TAKING THE SAILOR'S HAND HE BECAME AN HONEST MAN AGAIN PENCROFT LOOKED AT HIS COMPANIONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS PROPOSAL BEING MET WITH ANY OBJECTION
NOW WHAT STYPTICS WHAT ANTIPHLOGISTICS OUGHT TO BE EMPLOYED BY WHAT MEANS COULD INFLAMMATION BE PREVENTED AT ANY RATE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS THAT THE TWO WOUNDS SHOULD BE DRESSED WITHOUT DELAY
A THREEFOLD THOUGHT WEIGHED ON HIS MIND WAS CYRUS STILL ALIVE IF HE WAS ALIVE WHERE WAS HE IF HE HAD SURVIVED FROM HIS FALL HOW WAS IT THAT HE HAD NOT FOUND SOME MEANS OF MAKING KNOWN HIS EXISTENCE
RECEIVED ORDERS TO BEAT ABOUT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST FROM THE EXTREMITY OF THE PROMONTORY WHICH FORMED THE TAIL OF THE PENINSULA THE COAST WAS ROUNDED FOR A DISTANCE OF FIVE MILES WHICH WAS RAPIDLY PASSED OVER
TO THE SUMMIT TO MORROW AND THEN WE SHALL SEE IF THIS LAND IS AN ISLAND OR A CONTINENT TILL THEN I REPEAT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE YES FIRE SAID THE OBSTINATE SAILOR AGAIN
THE SAILOR FIRST MADE SURE THAT IT WAS QUITE DRY THAT DONE WE MUST HAVE SOME PAPER SAID HE HERE REPLIED SPILETT AFTER SOME HESITATION TEARING A LEAF OUT OF HIS NOTE BOOK PENCROFT TOOK THE PIECE OF PAPER WHICH THE REPORTER HELD OUT TO HIM
AT THAT MOMENT PENCROFT STOPPED THE ONAGER AND IN A HOARSE VOICE OH THE VILLAINS HE EXCLAIMED AND HE POINTED TO A THICK SMOKE RISING FROM THE MILL THE SHEDS AND THE BUILDINGS AT THE POULTRY YARD
THAT THE VILLAINS HAVE SPARED HIM ASKED GIDEON SPILETT YES IF THEY HAD ANY INTEREST IN DOING SO WHAT YOU SUPPOSE THAT AYRTON FINDING HIS OLD COMPANIONS FORGETTING ALL THAT HE OWES US WHO KNOWS ANSWERED THE SAILOR
CYRUS HARDING AND HIS COMPANIONS SLEPT LIKE INNOCENT MARMOTS IN THE CAVE WHICH THE JAGUAR HAD SO POLITELY LEFT AT THEIR DISPOSAL
THE TRANSIT DESCRIBED BY THE BALL OUGHT TO BE AS EXTENDED AS POSSIBLE AND THIS TENSION COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THE PROJECTILE SHOULD BE IMPELLED WITH A VERY GREAT INITIAL VELOCITY NOW SAID HARDING TO HIS COMPANIONS
COLLECTED SOME MORE SHELL FISH AND THEN SILENTLY RETRACED THEIR STEPS TO THEIR DWELLING PENCROFT HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND STILL LOOKED FOR HIS BOX HE EVEN CLIMBED UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER FROM ITS MOUTH TO THE ANGLE WHERE THE RAFT HAD BEEN MOORED
BUT THAT THEY HAD CONCEIVED THE IMPOSSIBLE HOPE OF BRINGING BACK AYRTON TO THEMSELVES HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY USEFUL TO THEM IF THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO MAKE HIM TURN TRAITOR THIS INCIDENT WAS THEREFORE
AT LEAST WE SHOULD SURVEY THE UNKNOWN SHORE AND THEN WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO BEGIN THE EXPLORATION AGAIN VERY GOOD SAID PENCROFT BUT THE BOAT THE BOAT HAS REMAINED BY ITSELF FOR ONE DAY AT THE SOURCES OF THE MERCY REPLIED GIDEON SPILETT
THESE CREATURES CANNOT KEEP US LONG AT BAY I SHALL NOT BE SURE OF THAT TILL I SEE THEM DOWN HERE REPLIED THE SAILOR AND NOW CAPTAIN DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY DOZENS OF THESE FELLOWS ARE UP THERE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REPLY TO PENCROFT AND AS FOR THE YOUNG BOY MAKING ANOTHER ATTEMPT
THE SETTLERS ASKED IF GRANITE HOUSE WAS INHABITED OR NOT AND YET THE POSITION OF THE LADDER WAS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT IT WAS IT WAS ALSO CERTAIN THAT THE INHABITANTS WHOEVER THEY MIGHT BE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE BUT HOW WERE THEY TO BE GOT AT
EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE FIRST ORDER OF THE QUADRUMANA WHETHER THIS WAS A CHIMPANZEE AN ORANGOUTANG OR A GORILLA HE TOOK RANK AMONG THE ANTHROPOID APES WHO ARE SO CALLED FROM THEIR RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN RACE
NO CAPTAIN REPLIED THE BOY WE SHALL KNOW TO MORROW SAID THE ENGINEER TILL THEN THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE YES REPLIED PENCROFT WHAT FIRE SAID THE SAILOR WHO ALSO HAD A FIXED IDEA
SUCH WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PART OF THE ISLAND WHICH THE SETTLERS TOOK IN AT A GLANCE WHILE STOPPING FOR AN INSTANT IF A VESSEL RAN IN HERE SAID PENCROFT SHE WOULD CERTAINLY BE LOST SANDBANKS AND REEFS EVERYWHERE BAD QUARTERS
WE MUST MEET THEM HAND TO HAND COME NOW IS THERE NO WAY OF GETTING AT THEM LET US TRY TO ENTER GRANITE HOUSE BY THE OLD OPENING AT THE LAKE REPLIED THE ENGINEER OH SHOUTED THE SAILOR AND I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
BUT PENCROFT ANSWERED SPILETT YOU ARE DESCRIBING A PICTURE OF THE CREATOR POSSIBLY MISTER SPILETT REPLIED THE SAILOR BUT THAT IS HOW I IMAGINE HIM AND YOU AYRTON ASKED THE ENGINEER CAPTAIN HARDING REPLIED AYRTON
HAVING THROWN A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM THE ENGINEER SEATED HIMSELF ON A BLOCK OF STONE HERBERT OFFERED HIM A FEW HANDFULS OF SHELL FISH AND SARGASSUM SAYING
IN WHICH HE HAD SO HAPPILY PERFORMED HIS GROUSE FISHING
SO AS TO KEEP OPEN A RETREAT AT LENGTH AN OPENING IN THE TREES ALLOWED THE SEA HORIZON TO BE SEEN BUT THE CART CONTINUED ITS PROGRESS FOR NOT ONE OF ITS DEFENDERS THOUGHT OF ABANDONING IT
AND NOW THE PIECES WERE AS BRILLIANT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ON BOARD A FRIGATE OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY ON THIS DAY THEREFORE IN PRESENCE OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COLONY INCLUDING MASTER JUP AND TOP THE FOUR CANNON WERE SUCCESSIVELY TRIED
OBSERVED THE DIAMOND MAN AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WOULD BE FRIGHTENED BUT I'M NOT A BIT IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN SOMETHING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOON SAID MISTER PARKER SUDDENLY
WAS DROPPED OFF THE AIRSHIP WHEN IT WAS SENT DOWN TO WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE EARTH IT WILL TAKE YOU SOME TIME TO GET TO A TELEGRAPH OFFICE SAID MISTER JENKS AS A PACKAGE OF FOOD AND A FLASK OF WATER WAS TOSSED DOWN TO THE STOWAWAY
I HAD BEEN TRICKED THAT WAS ALL AS SOON AS THE MEN HAD MY MONEY THEY HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR ME THEY DID NOT WANT ME TO LEARN THE SECRET OF THEIR DIAMOND MAKING AND THEY DRUGGED ME CARRIED ME AWAY FROM THE CAVE AND LEFT ME IN THE HOTEL DIDN'T YOU TRY TO FIND THE CAVE AGAIN
HOWEVER I DECIDED TO COME HERE AND I DID IT SEEMED ALMOST PROVIDENTIAL THAT MY FIRST VIEW OF YOU WAS IN A JEWELRY SHOP LOOKING AT DIAMONDS I TOOK IT AS A GOOD OMEN NOW IT REMAINS WITH YOU MAY I CALL HERE TO MORROW NIGHT AND GET YOUR ANSWER
HE CALLED AT MY APARTMENTS ABOUT A WEEK LATER SAYING HE HAD SECURED WORK AS AN EXPERT SETTER OF DIAMONDS AND WANTED TO REPAY ME I DID NOT WANT TO TAKE HIS MONEY BUT THE FACT THAT SUCH A SORRY LOOKING SPECIMEN OF MANHOOD AS HE HAD BEEN WHEN I AIDED HIM WAS AN EXPERT HANDLER OF GEMS INTERESTED ME
THAT'S SO CRIED TOM WE MUST TRY TO CAPTURE HIM I THINK WE HAD BETTER THE LAD PAUSED AND AGAIN LISTENED TO THE WIRELESS MESSAGE FATHER SAYS ERADICATE SAW THE MAN HAVE A GUN SO WE MUST BE CAREFUL
COMPLIMENTED MISTER PARKER IS IT ALWAYS AS EASY AS THIS STARTING ALWAYS IS WAS THE ANSWER THOUGH AS THE IRISHMAN SAID COMING DOWN ISN'T SOMETIMES QUITE SO COMFORTABLE BLESS MY GIZZARD THAT'S SO
THAT'S GOOD THEN WE MAY BE SAVED ON THEY RAN THEY HAD NO LANTERNS BUT THE BLUE LIGHT OF THE ELECTRICITY AS IT LEAPED FROM POINT TO POINT INSIDE THE CAVE
THERE IS EVERY INDICATION OF IT AND HE SEEMED QUITE DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT OF HIS PREDICTION COMING TRUE A HURRICANE CRIED MISTER DAMON I HOPE IT ISN'T LIKE THE ONE THAT BLEW US TO EARTHQUAKE ISLAND
WE MUST GET HIM OUT AT ONCE DECLARED MISTER JENKS I KNEW SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN ON THIS VOYAGE CAME FROM MISTER PARKER I PREDICTED IT FROM THE FIRST TOM THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE
AS THE IRON ORE EXTENDS FOR MILES WE CAN NOT GET OUT OF THE DANGER ZONE BEFORE THE STORM WILL REACH US IT WILL BE HERE IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR THEN WE'D BETTER HAVE SUPPER REMARKED TOM PRACTICALLY
NO SAH IT AIN'T MASSA DAMON DE GEN'MAN'S IN DE AIRSHIP SHED WAITIN FO YOU IN THE AIRSHIP SHED NO STRANGERS ARE ALLOWED IN THERE RAD
HERE RAD COME OVER AND SCURRY AMONG THOSE TREES WE JUST SAW SOME ONE SNEAKING AROUND I'LL SURE DO DAT CRIED THE COLORED MAN MEBBY IT WERE SOMEBODY ARTER BOOMERANG I'LL FIND EM I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS ANY ONE AFTER THE MULE MURMURED MISTER JENKS
THAT AFTERNOON TOM BUSIED HIMSELF ABOUT SOME WIRES AND A NUMBER OF COMPLICATED PIECES OF APPARATUS WHICH WERE IN ONE CORNER OF THE MAIN CABIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ASKED MISTER JENKS WHO HAD BEEN TALKING WITH MISTER PARKER
AND AN ALARM BELL WOULD SOUND IN HIS STATEROOM WHEN ANYTHING WENT WRONG BLESS MY NAPKIN EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON THE NEXT MORNING AS THEY SAT DOWN TO A BREAKFAST OF FRUIT HAM AND EGGS AND FRAGRANT COFFEE
AND THE YOUNG INVENTOR WISHED TO GET THE OPINION OF SOME OTHER JEWELER THAN MISTER TRACK AT LEAST AT FIRST THOUGH IF THIS ONE PROVES TO BE A GOOD GEM I'LL HAVE MISTER TRACK SET IT IN A BROOCH AND GIVE IT TO MARY FOR HER BIRTHDAY DECIDED THE YOUNG INVENTOR
THEIR INTERLOCKING BRANCHES HIDING THE GIRL TOM DID SEE CROWDS OF OTHER PERSONS THOUGH THRONGING THE STREETS OF SHOPTON FOR THOUGH THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD MADE MANY FLIGHTS THERE WAS ALWAYS A NOVELTY ABOUT THEM THAT BROUGHT OUT THE CURIOUS
AND BY NIGHT THEY HAD COVERED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES THROUGH THE DARKNESS THE RED CLOUD KEPT ON MAKING GOOD TIME TOM GOT UP OCCASIONALLY TO LOOK TO THE MACHINERY
I CAME EAST AND TRIED TO GET HELP TO DISCOVER THE CAVE OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS BUT I WAS UNSUCCESSFUL I NEEDED AN AIRSHIP AS I SAID AND NO PERSON WHO COULD OPERATE ONE WOULD AGREE TO GO WITH ME ON THE QUEST AGAIN
THE FIGURES OF SOME MEN RUNNING MADLY COULD BE SEEN THERE THEY GO HE SAID I FANCY WE HAVE SEEN THE LAST OF THEM AND THEY HAD FOR SOME TIME AT LEAST THERE WAS LITTLE USE LINGERING ANY LONGER ON PHANTOM MOUNTAIN INDEED
AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN OPPRESSIVENESS IN THE ATMOSPHERE IT WAS NOW QUITE DARK SAVE WHEN THE FITFUL LIGHTNING FLASHES CAME AND THEY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE BRILLIANTLY FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN BY CONTRAST
HE WAS AWARE OF A MOVEMENT IN A LITTLE SPACE FORMED BY ONE BOX WHICH WAS PLACED ON TOP OF TWO OTHERS THE LAD SAW A DARK FIGURE MOVING AS IF TO GET FARTHER OUT OF SIGHT I'VE GOT HIM CRIED TOM MAKING A DIVE FOR THE SHADOW
SUPPER WAS NEARLY READY WHEN MISTER PARKER RETURNED HIS FACE WORE A RATHER SERIOUS AIR AND MISTER DAMON NOTING IT ASKED LAUGHINGLY WELL
TOM AND THE OTHERS DEVOTED SEVERAL HOURS TO ARRANGING THEIR STATEROOMS AND BUNKS AND GETTING THEIR CLOTHING STOWED AWAY AND WHEN THIS WAS DONE MISTER PARKER AND MISTER JENKS SAT GAZING OFF INTO SPACE IT'S HARD TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE REALLY IN AN AIRSHIP
FOR NOW LOW MUTTERINGS OF THUNDER COULD BE HEARD OFF TOWARD THE WEST BLACK CLOUDS RAPIDLY OBSCURED THE HEAVENS AND THE SOUND OF THUNDER INCREASED
THAT IF YOU DO HEAR IT YOU WILL BE SO FASCINATED BY IT THAT I AM SURE YOU WILL WANT TO CAST YOUR LOT IN WITH MINE AND AID ME TO GET MY RIGHTS AND SOLVE THE MYSTERY AND I ALSO WANT TO WARN YOU THAT IF YOU DO THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DANGER CONNECTED WITH IT
ANSWERED TOM AS HE ACCEPTED THE GEMS WHICH THE EXPERT HELD OUT TO HIM THEN MIGHT WE SPEAK FOR A SUPPLY WENT ON MISTER ROBERTS EAGERLY WE WILL PAY YOU THE FULL MARKET PRICE WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THESE STONES ASKED
LEAPED FOR THE SAME SPOT IN THE MOUNTAIN THERE'S A MASS OF IRON ORE THERE YELLED MISTER PARKER THE LIGHTNING IS ATTRACTED TO IT HIS VOICE WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE TERRIFIC CRASH THAT FOLLOWED
A HASTY EXAMINATION HOWEVER SHOWED THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN DISTURBED
I WONDERED WHERE HE HAD BEEN KEEPING HIMSELF SINCE HE DAMAGED THE BUTTERFLY EVIDENTLY HE DOESN'T DARE VENTURE BACK TO SHOPTON WELL HERE'S WHERE I GIVE HIM A SCARE TOM'S MONOPLANE WAS MAKING NO MORE NOISE NOW THAN A SOARING BIRD
WAS THE REPLY OR RATHER WE DIDN'T IT WAS THE NERVOUS REACTION CAUSED BY YOUR FRIGHT AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAD DONE WRONG THAT MADE YOU JUMP OVER THE HANDLEBARS THAT'S THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION YOU YOU DID IT
THAT THE COLORED MAN HAD HAD A METHOD IN HIS MADNESS ON HIS WAY BACK THROUGH THE MOTOR ROOM TOM LOOKED TO THE MACHINERY AND ADJUSTED SOME OF THE AUXILIARY OIL FEEDERS THE VARIOUS PIECES OF APPARATUS WERE WORKING WELL
AND I'M JUST BACK FROM ALASKA PROSPECTING AROUND HERE I HAVEN'T HAD ANY LUCK BUT I KNOW OF A GOLD MINE IN ALASKA THAT WILL MAKE US ALL RICH ONLY IT NEEDS AN AIRSHIP TO GET TO IT AND I'VE BEEN FIGURING HOW TO HIRE ONE THEN I COMES ALONG
I'LL JUST DROP DOWN OUTSIDE OF THE CITY HE REASONED FOR TOO MUCH OF A CROWD GATHERS WHEN I LAND IN THE STREET BESIDES I MIGHT FRIGHTEN HORSES AND THEN TOO IT'S HARD TO GET A GOOD START FROM THE STREET I'LL LEAVE IT IN SOME BARN UNTIL I WANT TO GO BACK
CHAPTER THREE A STRANGE STORY WELL MISTER JENKS BEGAN TOM WHEN HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE GARDEN AND GREETED THE MAN WHO HAD ACTED SO STRANGELY ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND THIS IS RATHER AN ODD TIME FOR A VISIT
HOW YOU GOT ABOARD AND WHAT YOUR OBJECT WAS IN COMING THAT'S EASY ENOUGH I HAD BEEN HANGING AROUND THE SHED FOR SEVERAL DAYS WATCHING A CHANCE TO GET IN FINALLY I SAW IT WHEN THAT COLORED MAN WENT TO FEED HIS MULE AND I SLIPPED IN AND
WHISPERED MISTER DAMON WE'LL SOON FIND OUT ANSWERED TOM LET'S GO IN THEY ENTERED AND IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR PLAN TOM AND HIS FRIEND TALKED OF VARIOUS FOODS
REACHED THE EARS OF OUR FRIENDS PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HAS BEEN DESTROYED JUST AS I SAID IT WOULD BE SPOKE MISTER PARKER SOLEMNLY ONCE MORE HE HAD PROPHESIED CORRECTLY
HAD BEEN GROWING LOUDER AND SHARPER INDICATING THE NEARER APPROACH OF THE STORM EACH LIGHTNING FLASH WAS FOLLOWED IN A SECOND OR TWO BY A TERRIFIC CLAP STILL THERE WAS NO WIND NOR RAIN
FROM WHICH JAGGED TONGUES OF LIGHTNING PLAYED THE OUTSIDE WAS MUCH LIGHTER THAN THE DARK CAVE I SHOULD SAY IT WAS A STORM CRIED TOM SWIFT SEE IT IS STRIKING EVERY MINUTE AND ALL AROUND US
THROW ME OVER WITH THE AIRSHIP TWO MILES HIGH ARE YOU GASPED THE MAN WILL YOU TELL US WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IF WE DON'T ASKED MISTER JENKS
I WAS TOUCHED BY THE MAN'S APPEARANCE AND GAVE HIM SOME MONEY HE ASKED FOR MY CARD SAYING HE WOULD REPAY ME SOME DAY I GAVE IT TO HIM LITTLE THINKING I WOULD HEAR FROM THE MAN AGAIN BUT I DID
THE MAN'S FACE SHOWED THE ALARM HE FELT OH DON'T WORRY SAID MISTER JENKS QUICKLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO TOSS YOU OVERBOARD
ASKED MISTER JENKS RISING FROM HIS SEAT THE MYSTERIOUS MAN IS ABOARD THE AIRSHIP HIDDEN AWAY CRIED TOM THAT'S WHAT ERADICATE WAS TRYING TO CALL TO OUR ATTENTION AS WE STARTED OFF
AFTER TRAVELING FOR SOME DISTANCE I WAS LED STILL BLINDFOLDED UP A STEEP TRAIL WHEN THE BANDAGE WAS TAKEN OFF MY EYES I SAW THAT I WAS IN A LARGE CAVE THE MEN WERE WITH ME AND THEY APOLOGIZED FOR THE NECESSITY THAT CAUSED THEM TO BLINDFOLD ME
HE WAS LOOKING FROM THE REAR STOREROOM WINDOW HE'S THE SAME MAN WHO CALLED ON ME THAT TIME RAD REMEMBERS HIM VERY WELL BLESS MY SHOES WHAT'S TO BE DONE INQUIRED MISTER DAMON LOOKING AROUND HELPLESSLY
WHEN WE GOT TO A SMALL TOWN CALLED INDIAN RIDGE NEAR LEADVILLE COLORADO THE MEN INSISTED THAT I MUST NOW PROCEED IN SECRET AND CONSENT TO BE BLINDFOLDED AS THEY WERE NOT YET READY TO REVEAL THE SECRET OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY MADE THE DIAMONDS
WHOM WE LEFT IN THE FOREST COULD HAVE GOTTEN HERE AND WARNED THEM ASKED MISTER DAMON IT'S POSSIBLE ADMITTED TOM BUT NOW LET'S SEE IF THE PERSON WHO PINNED THIS WARNING ON OUR TENT TOOK ANY OF OUR THINGS
OH I THINK THERE WILL BE NO DANGER SPOKE TOM IF IT COMES ON TO BLOW WE WILL ASCEND OR DESCEND OUT OF THE PATH OF THE STORM THIS CRAFT IS NOT LIKE THE ILL FATED WHIZZER I CAN MORE EASILY HANDLE THE RED CLOUD EVEN IN A BAD STORM
AND WAS ABOUT TO DASH WITH THEM TO THE EARTH THE MEN LEAPED TO THEIR FEET AND STARED AT THE LAD A STOWAWAY ON BOARD CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SOUL HOW DID HE ARE YOU SURE THAT MESSAGE IS STRAIGHT ASKED MISTER JENKS
AND HE DIRECTED ME TO PULL THE LEVER OF THE BOX AT A CERTAIN SIGNAL THE SIGNAL CAME JUST AS A TERRIFIC CRASH OF THUNDER SHOOK THE VERY MOUNTAIN INSIDE OF WHICH WE WERE THE BOX OF STEEL GOT RED HOT AND WHEN IT COOLED OFF IT WAS OPENED
THE OTHER IN A ROUGH STATE DO YOU CARE TO STATE WHERE THESE DIAMONDS CAME FROM ASKED MISTER ROBERTS LOOKING CRITICALLY AT TOM I HAD RATHER NOT ANSWERED THE LAD IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE DIAMONDS
IT'S THE ONLY CRAFT THAT WILL SERVE OUR PURPOSE AMONG THE TOWERING MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHERE THE DIAMOND MAKERS ARE HIDDEN I HOPE WE CAN FIND THEM IN A LITTLE WHILE THE RED CLOUD WAS SKIMMING ALONG AT FASTER SPEED
NO WAY CAN BE TOO SHORT SAID MISTER PARKER SOLEMNLY THIS MOUNTAIN WILL GO TO PIECES SHORTLY I THINK TOM SHUDDERED HE REMEMBERED HOW NARROW HAD BEEN THEIR ESCAPE WHEN EARTHQUAKE ISLAND SANK INTO THE SEA AND THAT
I'M USED TO DANGER ANSWERED TOM QUIETLY LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY BUT FIRST EXPLAIN HOW YOU CAME TO COME HERE AND WHY YOU ACTED SO STRANGELY AT THE JEWELRY STORE WILLINGLY
RATHER ODD COMMENTED MISTER JENKS BLACK PAPER AND WHITE INK WHITE INK IS EASY ENOUGH TO MAKE STATED MISTER PARKER
BUT UP TO THE TIME I MET YOU ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND I COULD FORM NO PLAN FOR DISCOVERING PHANTOM MOUNTAIN AND LEARNING THE SECRET OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS WENT ON MISTER JENKS
THEY ARE SO FAR SUPERIOR TO THE USUAL RUN OF DIAMONDS THAT I FEEL JUSTIFIED IN SAYING THAT THE CUT ONE WOULD BRING FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ANYWHERE IN FACT I WOULD OFFER THAT FOR IT THE OTHER IS LARGER THOUGH WHAT IT WOULD LOSE IN CUTTING WOULD BE HARD TO SAY
IS WHAT GONE ASKED TOM GRIMLY AT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE ANDY LOOKED UP WAS THAT YOU TOM SWIFT HE DEMANDED DID YOU KNOCK ME OFF MY WHEEL MY MONOPLANE AND I TOGETHER DID
NOW I'VE GOT YOU HE SHOUTED I'LL TEACH YOU TO SLASH MY AEROPLANE COME WITH ME ANDY GAVE ONE LOOK AT THE WHITE BIRD LIKE APPARATUS THAT HAD FLOWN UP BESIDE HIM SO NOISELESSLY AND BEING TOO FRIGHTENED TO RECOGNIZE TOM'S VOICE
TOM SWIFT CONSIDERED A FEW MINUTES ON THE FACE OF IT THE PROPOSITION APPEALED TO HIM HE HAD BEEN HOME SOME TIME NOW AFTER HIS ADVENTURES ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO LONG FOR MORE EXCITEMENT
THEY STOOD STILL AWED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO THEN ONCE MORE CAME A TERRIFIC CLAP A GREAT MASS OF FIRE LIKE SOME RED HOT INGOT FROM A FOUNDRY
AND THEN GO ON BEFORE YOU CAN SEND ANY WORD TO YOUR CONFEDERATES WE'LL PUT YOU OFF IN THE MOST LONESOME SPOT WE CAN FIND AND I GUESS YOU'LL BE SOME TIME GETTING BACK TO CIVILIZATION BY THAT TIME WE'LL HAVE THE SECRET OF THE DIAMONDS YOU NEVER WILL
BUT VERY PERFECT DIAMONDS THEY HAD COME TO THE END OF THEIR ROPE THOUGH SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THE MATERIALS NEEDED FOLWELL SAID THAT HE AND HIS COMPANIONS HAD TEMPORARILY SEPARATED
I'LL BE HERE AT THIS TIME TO MORROW AS MISTER JENKS TURNED ASIDE THERE WAS A MOVEMENT AMONG THE TREES IN THE ORCHARD AND A SHADOWY FIGURE WAS SEEN HURRYING AWAY WHO'S THAT ASKED THE DIAMOND MAN IN A HOARSE WHISPER
YOU MEAN YOU CAN HARDLY BELIEVE ME ASKED MISTER JENKS I GUESS THAT'S IT ASSENTED TOM I DON'T BLAME YOU A BIT EXCLAIMED THE ODD MAN IN FACT I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD MAKE DIAMONDS
THEN STEPPING CLOSE TO TOM HE WHISPERED MISTER JENKS TOLD ME MISTER JENKS TOM COULD NOT CONCEAL HIS ASTONISHMENT YES MISTER BARCOE JENKS BUT I DID NOT COME HERE TO MERELY ASK YOU FOR EMPLOYMENT
THE CORDS WERE PRODUCED AND THE MAN WHO HAD NOW CEASED TO STRUGGLE WAS TIGHTLY BOUND HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT HE SMILED GRIMLY WHEN MISTER DAMON REMARKED I GUESS I'LL GO BACK IN THE STOREROOM TOM AND SEE HOW MUCH FOOD HE ATE
I'LL BE HERE TO MORROW NIGHT TOM AND I HOPE YOUR ANSWER WILL BE FAVORABLE TOM DID NOT SLEEP WELL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT FOR HIS FITFUL SLUMBERS WERE DISTURBED BY DREAMS OF ENORMOUS CAVES FILLED WITH DIAMONDS WITH DARK SHADOWY FIGURES TRYING TO PUT HIM INTO A RED HOT STEEL BOX
QUERIED THE PROPRIETOR OF THE PLACE TOM NOTICED AT ONCE THAT THE WORD DIAMONDS WAS NOT USED I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THEY WERE OF ANY VALUE HE SAID ARE THEY DIAMONDS WOULD YOU MIND STATING WHERE YOU GOT THEM
CONNECTED WITH IT MISTER JENKS HAD NO ONE TO WHOM HE WANTED TO SEND ANY WORD BUT MISTER PARKER WISH TO WIRE TO A FELLOW SCIENTIST THE RESULT OF SOME OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE UPPER AIR TOM NOTED ALL THE MESSAGES DOWN
IN THE RAYS OF THE MOON IT SHOWED ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW A BEAUTIFUL GEM THAT IS ONE OF THE STONES I MADE OR RATHER THAT I SUPPOSED I HAD MADE WENT ON MISTER JENKS IT IS ONE OF SEVERAL I HAVE
PRESENTLY TWO ELDERLY GENTLEMEN CAME FROM THE LITTLE ROOM ON THE GLASS DOOR OF WHICH APPEARED THE WORD DIAMONDS WHO BROUGHT THESE STONES IN ASKED ONE OF THE MEN EVIDENTLY THE PROPRIETOR FROM THE DEFERENCE PAID HIM BY THE CLERK
THAT MAN IS ONE OF MY ENEMIES HE HAS BEEN SENT BY THE BAND OF DIAMOND MAKERS HIDDEN AMONG THE MOUNTAINS TO SPY ON ME AND IF POSSIBLE PREVENT ME FROM SEEKING TO DISCOVER THEIR SECRET
WAS HURLED THROUGH THE AIR STRAIGHT AT THE FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND AT THE SPOT WHERE THE FIGURE IN WHITE HAD STOOD BUT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE INSTANTLY THE EARTH TREMBLED AS IT HAD AT EARTHQUAKE ISLAND
THE YOUNG INVENTOR ADDED AS HE SAW THE CLERK LOOKING RATHER DOUBTFULLY AT HIM FOR TOM HAD ON A ROUGH SUIT WHICH HE ALWAYS DONNED WHEN HE FLEW IN HIS MONOPLANE
DAD WILL WANT TO KNOW HOW WE ARE DOING AS HE WORKED AWAY HE ALSO MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEND ANOTHER MESSAGE IN CARE OF HIS FATHER FOR THERE WAS A RECEIVING STATION IN THE SWIFT HOME AND TO WHOM THIS MESSAGE WAS ADDRESSED TOM DID NOT SAY
YOU MUST KEEP AWAY FROM THERE AND IF WE REFUSE ASKED TOM THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE WHAT COMES BUT NOT FROM YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER JENKS WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF YOU
BUT NO SOONER HAD THE YOUNG INVENTOR SENT OFF THE FIRST FEW DOTS AND DASHES REPRESENTING S I HIS HOME STATION CALL THAN HE STARTED AND A LOOK OF SURPRISE CAME OVER HIS FACE THEY'RE CALLING US HE EXCLAIMED WHO IS
THEY HAD ALL AGREED TO GO OUT INTO CIVILIZATION AND WORK FOR ENOUGH FUNDS TO ENABLE THEM TO GO ON WITH THEIR DIAMOND MAKING I HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO BELIEVE THE MAN OR NOT BUT HE OFFERED PROOF HE HAD SEVERAL SMALL BUT VERY PERFECT DIAMONDS WITH HIM
AS THE ELECTRICITY LEAPED FROM THE TRANSMITTERS INTO SPACE THEN HE CLAMPED THE RECEIVER ON HIS EAR ALL READY HE ANNOUNCED HAS ANYBODY ANY MESSAGES THEY WISH SENT FOR WITH THE COURTESY OF A TRUE HOST
THEN WE MUST GET AHEAD OF HIM DECIDED TOM QUIETLY I HAVE JUST FLASHED TO DAD A MESSAGE TELLING HIM THAT WE WILL HEED HIS WARNING NOW TO CAPTURE THE STOWAWAY
THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP THERE WAS COMMOTION IN ROARING CAMP IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A FIGHT FOR IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THAT WAS NOT NOVEL ENOUGH TO HAVE CALLED TOGETHER THE ENTIRE SETTLEMENT
WHEN SHE MOST NEEDED THE MINISTRATION OF HER OWN SEX DISSOLUTE ABANDONED AND IRRECLAIMABLE SHE WAS YET SUFFERING A MARTYRDOM HARD ENOUGH TO BEAR EVEN WHEN VEILED BY SYMPATHIZING WOMANHOOD
OBEYING THIS PRINCIPLE ALL HILARITY CEASED ON MY ENTRANCE TO SUPPER AND GENERAL REMARK MERGED INTO THE SAFER AND UNCOMPROMISING CHRONICLE OF SEVERAL BAD CASES OF DIPHTHERIA THEN EPIDEMIC AT WINGDAM
NOW MISSUS MORPHER OBEYING A COMMENDABLE IMPULSE BOUGHT ANOTHER DOLL AND GAVE IT TO MLISS THE CHILD RECEIVED IT GRAVELY AND CURIOUSLY THE MASTER ON LOOKING AT IT ONE DAY FANCIED HE SAW A SLIGHT RESEMBLANCE IN ITS ROUND
OF COURSE SHE WAS NOT INFALLIBLE BUT HER COURAGE AND DARING IN PASSING BEYOND HER OWN DEPTH AND THAT OF THE FLOUNDERING LITTLE SWIMMERS AROUND HER IN THEIR MINDS OUTWEIGHED ALL ERRORS OF JUDGMENT CHILDREN ARE NOT BETTER THAN GROWN PEOPLE IN THIS RESPECT I FANCY
HE EXCUSED HIMSELF AND WENT HOME FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER THE ADVENT OF THE DRAMATIC COMPANY MLISS WAS LATE AT SCHOOL AND THE MASTER'S USUAL FRIDAY AFTERNOON RAMBLE WAS FOR ONCE OMITTED OWING TO THE ABSENCE OF HIS TRUSTWORTHY GUIDE
IT HAD AN INDESCRIBABLY UNREAL AND THEATRICAL EFFECT IT WAS THE FULL MOON OF NORMA THAT REMARKABLE CELESTIAL PHENOMENON WHICH RISES SO PALPABLY TO A HUSHED AUDIENCE AND A SUBLIME ANDANTE CHORUS UNTIL THE CASTA DIVA IS SUNG
AFTER SMITH'S DEATH HE ADDRESSED LETTERS TO SMITH'S RELATIVES AND RECEIVED ONE ANSWER FROM A SISTER OF MELISSA'S MOTHER THANKING THE MASTER SHE STATED HER INTENTION OF LEAVING THE ATLANTIC STATES FOR CALIFORNIA WITH HER HUSBAND IN A FEW MONTHS
THOSE NEAREST THE DOOR AND THE CAMP STOPPED TO LISTEN ABOVE THE SWAYING AND MOANING OF THE PINES THE SWIFT RUSH OF THE RIVER AND THE CRACKLING OF THE FIRE
AND THEN LOOKED AROUND FOR SOMEBODY TO ENJOY THE JOKE WITH HIM I KNOW THAT SHE IS A STRANGE WILLFUL GIRL CONTINUED THE MASTER BUT SHE IS BETTER THAN SHE WAS I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE SOME INFLUENCE OVER HER STILL I BEG AND HOPE THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL TAKE NO FURTHER STEPS IN THIS MATTER
NO ALLUSION WAS MADE TO THE MOTHER AND THE FATHER WAS UNKNOWN IT'S BETTER SAID THE PHILOSOPHICAL OAKHURST TO TAKE A FRESH DEAL ALL ROUND
AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T RECEIVE AS MUCH WAGES IF THEY WERE MARRIED AS IF THEY WERE MERELY LOVERS THAT IS ADDED THE MASTER IF THEY ARE NOT ALREADY MARRIED TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT I THINK THE HUSBAND OF THE PRETTY YOUNG COUNTESS TAKES THE TICKETS AT THE DOOR OR PULLS UP THE CURTAIN OR SNUFFS THE CANDLES OR DOES SOMETHING EQUALLY REFINED AND ELEGANT
AT OTHER TIMES SETTING IT UP ON HER DESK SHE MADE A PINCUSHION OF ITS PATIENT AND INOFFENSIVE BODY WHETHER THIS WAS DONE IN REVENGE OF WHAT SHE CONSIDERED A SECOND FIGURATIVE OBTRUSION OF CLYTIE'S EXCELLENCES UPON HER
I'D RATHER DIE FIRST WITH A DRAMATIC GESTURE WHICH WAS PERFECTLY CONSISTENT WITH HER CHARACTER SHE DREW FROM HER BOSOM A FEW LIMP GREEN LEAVES AND HOLDING THEM OUT AT ARM'S LENGTH SAID IN HER QUICK VIVID WAY AND IN THE QUEER PRONUNCIATION OF HER OLD LIFE
AND WERE THE THEME OF MUCH EXCITEMENT AND GREAT SPECULATION AMONG THE MASTER'S SCHOLARS
THIS WAS A SLIGHT SUPERSTRUCTURE FOR THE AIRY CASTLE WHICH THE MASTER PICTURED FOR MLISS'S HOME BUT IT WAS EASY TO FANCY THAT SOME LOVING SYMPATHETIC WOMAN WITH THE CLAIMS OF KINDRED MIGHT BETTER GUIDE HER WAYWARD NATURE YET
HE APPEARED TO BE SERENELY HAPPY ALBEIT THERE WAS AN INFANTINE GRAVITY ABOUT HIM
AND CURSE THE LUCK WAS ABANDONED AS HAVING A NEW PERSONAL BEARING VOCAL MUSIC WAS NOT INTERDICTED BEING SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SOOTHING TRANQUILIZING QUALITY AND ONE SONG
WAS THE FIRST SPASM OF PROPRIETY THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF THE CAMP'S REGENERATION STUMPY ADVANCED NOTHING PERHAPS HE FELT A CERTAIN DELICACY IN INTERFERING WITH THE SELECTION OF A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR IN OFFICE
TO EXPRESS CLYTEMNESTRA NO UPON YOUR WORD A SUBSTITUTE FOR HOPE YOU'LL DIE PROPOSED BY THE MASTER YES AND SACRED HONOR YES THEN MLISS GAVE HIM A FIERCE LITTLE KISS AND HOPPING DOWN FLUTTERED OFF
HE UNCOVERED HOWEVER AS HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
OF THE RECKLESS IRREVERENCE OF ROARING CAMP THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES WAS ONE BOSTON A NOTED WAG AND THE OCCASION SEEMED TO PROMISE THE GREATEST FACETIOUSNESS THIS INGENIOUS SATIRIST
AND SO HE TOOK UP A COPY OF THE RED MOUNTAIN BANNER FROM ONE OF THE TABLES AND TRIED TO RECOVER HIS COMPOSURE BY READING THE COLUMN OF ADVERTISEMENTS HE THEN WALKED THROUGH THE BARROOM THROUGH THE RESTAURANT AND INTO THE BILLIARD ROOM THE CHILD WAS NOT THERE IN THE LATTER APARTMENT
AND HAIR AND GOLD PIN AND GOLD CHAIN SAID THE JUST ARISTIDES PUTTING PERIODS FOR COMMAS TO EKE OUT HIS BREATH THE MASTER PUT ON HIS GLOVES AND HAT
CHAPTER THREE SOMEWHAT LESS SPITEFUL IN HER INTERCOURSE WITH OTHER SCHOLARS MLISS STILL RETAINED AN OFFENSIVE ATTITUDE IN REGARD TO CLYTEMNESTRA PERHAPS THE JEALOUS ELEMENT WAS NOT ENTIRELY LULLED IN HER PASSIONATE LITTLE BREAST
NEARLY EXHAUSTED ABOUT TWO MILES BELOW
SUCH WAS THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE MEN THAT WERE DISPERSED AROUND THE CABIN
AND THE HIGHWAYMAN WITH BLACKENED FACE WHO DID THE THING SO QUIETLY DRIVING ME WHITHER THE THING IS PERFECTLY FEASIBLE AND WHAT IS THIS FANCY NOW BEING JOLTED OUT OF ME A STORY IT'S OF NO USE TO KEEP IT BACK
AND MADE AN IMAGINARY SHOT THAT SENT THE BALL SPINNING ROUND THE CUSHIONS THEN WALKING ROUND THE TABLE HE RECOVERED THE BALL AND PLACED IT UPON THE SPOT THIS DUTY DISCHARGED GETTING READY FOR ANOTHER SHOT HE SAID S'POSE SHE HAS
A YOUNG CREOLE PHYSICIAN KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF WINGDAM AS DUCHESNY HE NEVER MENTIONED IT TO MISSUS MORPHER CLYTIE OR ANY OF HIS SCHOLARS HIS RETICENCE WAS PARTLY THE RESULT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL INDISPOSITION TO FUSS PARTLY A DESIRE TO BE SPARED THE QUESTIONS AND SURMISES OF VULGAR CURIOSITY
THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GIVE IN AND I WAS ABOUT TO ACCEPT IT WEAKLY AS WE TOO OFTEN TREAT OTHER ILLUSIONS OF DARKNESS AND NECESSITY FOR THE TIME BEING
AND THE LAST HARVEST HAD BEEN GATHERED IN THE VALLEYS THE MASTER BETHOUGHT HIM OF GATHERING IN A FEW RIPENED SHOOTS OF THE YOUNG IDEA AND OF HAVING HIS HARVEST HOME OR EXAMINATION SO THE SAVANTS AND PROFESSIONALS OF SMITH'S POCKET WERE GATHERED TO WITNESS THAT TIME HONORED CUSTOM
IN FACT HE SEEMED TO ENJOY REPEATING IT
WITH THIS LOAD LIFTED FROM MY MIND AND ASSISTED BY THE MILD PRESENCE OF DIANA WHO LEFT AS WHEN SHE VISITED ENDYMION MUCH OF HER SPLENDOR OUTSIDE MY CAVERN I LOOKED AROUND THE EMPTY VEHICLE ON THE FORWARD SEAT LAY A WOMAN'S HAIRPIN
AND ANOINTED BY THE SLIME OF DITCHES IT LOOKED VERY MUCH AS MLISS HAD IN DAYS PAST ITS ONE GOWN OF FADED STUFF WAS DIRTY AND RAGGED AS HERS HAD BEEN MLISS HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO APPLY TO IT ANY CHILDISH TERM OF ENDEARMENT
WHEN I BECAME AWARE OF SOME OTHER ANNOYANCE THAT HAD BEEN FORCING ITSELF UPON ME FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HOW QUIET THE DRIVER WAS WAS THERE ANY DRIVER HAD I ANY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS NOT LYING GAGGED AND BOUND ON THE ROADSIDE
MY FEARS FOR THE DRIVER WERE DISSIPATED WITH THE RISING MOON A FAMILIAR SOUND HAD ASSURED ME OF HIS PRESENCE IN THE FULL POSSESSION OF AT LEAST ONE OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
THERE WAS A SHOUT AN IMPRECATION A SCUFFLE AND THE TRAMPLING OF MANY FEET THEN THE CROWD PARTED RIGHT AND LEFT AND TWO SHARP QUICK REPORTS FOLLOWED EACH OTHER IN RAPID SUCCESSION THEN THEY CLOSED AGAIN ABOUT HIS OPPONENT AND THE MASTER WAS STANDING ALONE
SHE NEVER EXHIBITED IT IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER CHILDREN IT WAS PUT SEVERELY TO BED IN A HOLLOW TREE NEAR THE SCHOOLHOUSE AND ONLY ALLOWED EXERCISE DURING MLISS'S RAMBLES FULFILLING A STERN DUTY TO HER DOLL AS SHE WOULD TO HERSELF IT KNEW NO LUXURIES
THE INMATES OF THE EUREKA HOUSE FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE THERE WAS THE PREVAILING OPINION SO COMMON TO MANY HONEST PEOPLE THAT A SERIOUS STYLE OF DEPORTMENT AND CONDUCT TOWARD A STRANGER INDICATES HIGH GENTILITY AND ELEVATED STATION
RED DOG HAD BEEN TWICE UNDER WATER AND ROARING CAMP HAD BEEN FOREWARNED
I GAVE IT TO YOU WHY DIDN'T YOU STICK HIM SAID MLISS RAPIDLY WITH AN EXPRESSIVE TWINKLE OF THE BLACK EYES AND A GESTURE OF THE LITTLE RED HAND
BUT WHEN QUESTIONED HE AVERRED STOUTLY THAT HE AND JINNY THE MAMMAL BEFORE ALLUDED TO COULD MANAGE TO REAR THE CHILD THERE WAS SOMETHING ORIGINAL INDEPENDENT AND HEROIC ABOUT THE PLAN THAT PLEASED THE CAMP
IT BEEN HERE ONCE AND WILL BE HERE AGAIN AND THAT NIGHT THE NORTH FORK SUDDENLY LEAPED OVER ITS BANKS AND SWEPT UP THE TRIANGULAR VALLEY OF ROARING CAMP
SMOKING THEIR PIPES AND DRINKING IN THE MELODIOUS UTTERANCES AN INDISTINCT IDEA THAT THIS WAS PASTORAL HAPPINESS PERVADED THE CAMP THIS ERE KIND O THINK
IT WAS OF NO USE TO RECALL THE MANY INSTANCES WHERE PRAISE TO THE FACE HAD REDOUNDED TO THE EVERLASTING HONOR OF PRAISER AND BEPRAISED OF NO USE TO DWELL SENTIMENTALLY ON MODEST GENIUS AND COURAGE LIFTED UP AND STRENGTHENED BY OPEN COMMENDATION
A SMALL VOICE PIPED AT HIS SIDE PLEASE SIR THE MASTER TURNED AND THERE STOOD ARISTIDES MORPHER WELL MY LITTLE MAN SAID THE MASTER IMPATIENTLY WHAT IS IT QUICK PLEASE SIR
THE WHOLE CAMP WAS COLLECTED BEFORE A RUDE CABIN ON THE OUTER EDGE OF THE CLEARING
LUNATICS HAD NOT YET REACHED SUCH DEPTH OF IMBECILITY AS TO RIDE OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL IN CALIFORNIA STAGES AND MY LAURA AMIABLE AND LONG SUFFERING AS SHE ALWAYS IS COULD NOT I FEAR
BUT AS A MAN AS A GENTLEMAN LEAVE HER TO ME I AM WILLING BUT HERE SOMETHING ROSE AGAIN IN THE MASTER'S THROAT AND THE SENTENCE REMAINED UNFINISHED THE MAN WITH THE GLAZED HAT MISTAKING THE MASTER'S SILENCE
AGAIN I SAW THAT IMPROBABLE MISTLETOE CUT FROM THAT IMPOSSIBLE OAK AND AGAIN COLD CHILLS RAN DOWN MY BACK WITH THE FIRST STRAIN OF THE RECITATIVE
AND THEN SHUT THE BOOK WITH A LOUD SNAP
WHICH SHE FELL INTO WHEN UNDULY EXCITED THAT'S THE POISON PLANT YOU SAID WOULD KILL ME I'LL GO WITH THE PLAY ACTORS OR I'LL EAT THIS AND DIE HERE I DON'T CARE WHICH I WON'T STAY HERE WHERE THEY HATE AND DESPISE ME NEITHER WOULD YOU LET ME IF YOU DIDN'T HATE AND DESPISE ME TOO
BY DINT OF MUCH GYMNASTIC EFFORT I BECAME SUFFICIENTLY COMPOSED TO BE AWARE OF A MORE REFINED SPECIES OF TORTURE THE SPRINGS OF THE STAGE RISING AND FALLING REGULARLY PRODUCED A RHYTHMICAL BEAT WHICH BEGAN TO ABSORB MY ATTENTION PAINFULLY
ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY A CHANGE CAME OVER THE SETTLEMENT THE CABIN ASSIGNED TO TOMMY LUCK OR THE LUCK AS HE WAS MORE FREQUENTLY CALLED FIRST SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT
THE ONLY OUTLET WAS A STEEP TRAIL OVER THE SUMMIT OF A HILL THAT FACED THE CABIN NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE RISING MOON THE SUFFERING WOMAN MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT FROM THE RUDE BUNK WHEREON SHE LAY
THE PINES STOPPED MOANING
NO SAID THE MASTER THAT'S WHAT I GAVE YOU THE KNIFE FOR SAID THE CHILD QUICKLY GAVE ME THE KNIFE REPEATED THE MASTER IN BEWILDERMENT YES GAVE YOU THE KNIFE I WAS THERE UNDER THE BAR SAW YOU HIT HIM SAW YOU BOTH FALL HE DROPPED HIS OLD KNIFE
THAT AT A MOMENT WHEN SHE MOST LACKED HER SEX'S INTUITIVE TENDERNESS AND CARE
PRAISE TO THE FACE IS OPEN DISGRACE I HEARD NO MORE DREADING SOME SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SINCERE EXPRESSION ON THE SUBJECT OF FEMALE LOVELINESS I WALKED AWAY
OR WHOSE HANDSOME BEARDED FACES LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOWS
THE DAMNED LITTLE CUSS HE SAID AS HE EXTRICATED HIS FINGER WITH PERHAPS MORE TENDERNESS AND CARE THAN HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEEMED CAPABLE OF SHOWING HE HELD THAT FINGER A LITTLE APART FROM ITS FELLOWS AS HE WENT OUT
THAT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE MLISS AND CLYTIE WERE PREEMINENT AND DIVIDED PUBLIC ATTENTION MLISS WITH HER CLEARNESS OF MATERIAL PERCEPTION AND SELF RELIANCE
SHE WOULD SEND WANDERING BREEZES TO VISIT HIM WITH THE BALM OF BAY AND RESINOUS GUM
TO ITS GENERAL VIRTUE AND USEFULNESS CAN ONLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THEIR AFFECTION FOR TOMMY A FEW STILL HELD OUT BUT THE RESOLVE COULD NOT BE CARRIED INTO EFFECT FOR THREE MONTHS
SO HELP ME GOD IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE NAME OF THE DEITY HAD BEEN OTHERWISE UTTERED THAN PROFANELY IN THE CAMP THE FORM OF CHRISTENING WAS PERHAPS EVEN MORE LUDICROUS THAN THE SATIRIST HAD CONCEIVED
HENCE THE EXCITEMENT YOU GO IN THERE STUMPY SAID A PROMINENT CITIZEN KNOWN AS KENTUCK ADDRESSING ONE OF THE LOUNGERS GO IN THERE AND SEE WHAT YOU KIN DO YOU'VE HAD EXPERIENCE IN THEM THINGS
THAT A MOMENT'S HESITATION OR INDECISION ON THE PART OF THE DRIVER WOULD HAVE DESTROYED I HAD INDULGED A HOPE THAT IN THE EMPTY VEHICLE I MIGHT OBTAIN THAT REST SO OFTEN DENIED ME IN ITS CROWDED CONDITION IT WAS A WEAK DELUSION
MLISS DREW A LONG DEEP BREATH AND TURNED TO THE MASTER'S GRAVE FACE WITH A HALF APOLOGETIC SMILE AND WEARIED GESTURE THEN SHE SAID NOW TAKE ME HOME AND DROPPED THE LIDS OF HER BLACK EYES AS IF TO DWELL ONCE MORE IN FANCY ON THE MIMIC STAGE
HE DROPPED OVER THE BANK ON HIS HEAD IN THE SOFT EARTH
INTIMATING THAT AT A CERTAIN PERIOD A CELEBRATED DRAMATIC COMPANY WOULD PERFORM FOR A FEW DAYS A SERIES OF SIDE SPLITTING AND SCREAMING FARCES THAT ALTERNATING PLEASANTLY WITH THIS THERE WOULD BE SOME MELODRAMA AND A GRAND DIVERTISEMENT WHICH WOULD INCLUDE SINGING DANCING ET CETERA
OF PLACING TIMID CHILDREN IN A CONSTRAINED POSITIONS AND BULLYING THEM AS IN A WITNESS BOX AS USUAL IN SUCH CASES THE MOST AUDACIOUS AND SELF POSSESSED WERE THE LUCKY RECIPIENTS OF THE HONORS THE READER WILL IMAGINE
A NUMBER OF INFINITESIMAL ANNOYANCES WINDING UP WITH THE RESOLUTE PERSISTENCY OF THE CLERK AT THE STAGE OFFICE TO ENTER MY NAME MISSPELT ON THE WAYBILL HAD NOT PREDISPOSED ME TO CHEERFULNESS
WHEN I STRETCHED OUT MY LIMBS IT WAS ONLY TO FIND THAT THE ORDINARY CONVENIENCES FOR MAKING SEVERAL PEOPLE DISTINCTLY UNCOMFORTABLE WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT MY INDIVIDUAL FRAME AT LAST RESTING MY ARMS ON THE STRAPS
THE BUMBLEBEES BUZZED AND THE ROOKS CAWED A SLUMBROUS ACCOMPANIMENT SUCH WAS THE GOLDEN SUMMER OF ROARING CAMP THEY WERE FLUSH TIMES AND THE LUCK WAS WITH THEM
TRUTH MLISS WAS BOTH FEARLESS AND SINCERE PERHAPS IN SUCH A CHARACTER THE ADJECTIVES WERE SYNONYMOUS THE MASTER HAD BEEN DOING SOME HARD THINKING ON THIS SUBJECT
I FOUND MY EYES WERE GROWING ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARKNESS
RUN DOWN HOME SAID HE TO THE BOY IF MLISS IS THERE COME TO THE ARCADE AND TELL ME IF SHE ISN'T THERE STAY HOME RUN AND OFF TROTTED THE SHORT LEGGED ARISTIDES THE ARCADE WAS JUST ACROSS THE WAY
HER SMALL PASSIONATE LIPS WERE SLIGHTLY PARTED TO GIVE VENT TO HER HURRIED BREATH HER WIDELY OPENED LIDS THREW UP AND ARCHED HER BLACK EYEBROWS SHE DID NOT LAUGH AT THE DISMAL COMICALITIES OF THE FUNNY MAN FOR MLISS SELDOM LAUGHED
IT IS A DARK NIGHT AND I FALL ASLEEP AND TELL MY HONEST COACHMAN ANDRE NOT TO DISTURB ME AND DREAM OF AN ANGEL THE CARRIAGE AT LAST STOPS AT THE CHATEAU
A PERSON WAS STANDING BY ONE OF THE TABLES WITH A BROAD BRIMMED GLAZED HAT ON HIS HEAD THE MASTER RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE AGENT OF THE DRAMATIC COMPANY HE HAD TAKEN A DISLIKE TO HIM AT THEIR FIRST MEETING FROM THE PECULIAR FASHION OF WEARING HIS BEARD AND HAIR
A LANCET A BANK OF ENGLAND NOTE FOR FIVE POUNDS AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN LOOSE GOLD AND SILVER COIN
CHECKING THE COMPLIMENT THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE RISEN UNBIDDEN TO MY LIPS AND HAVE BROUGHT SHAME AND SORROW TO THE HOUSEHOLD IT WAS WITH THE MEMORY OF THESE EXPERIENCES RESTING HEAVILY UPON ME THAT I STOOD HESITATINGLY BEFORE THE STAGE DOOR
THE DAMNED LITTLE CUSS IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK BEFORE THE CAMP SOUGHT REPOSE A LIGHT BURNT IN THE CABIN WHERE THE WATCHERS SAT FOR STUMPY DID NOT GO TO BED THAT NIGHT NOR DID KENTUCK
IT WAS KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN AND WHITEWASHED THEN IT WAS BOARDED CLOTHED AND PAPERED THE ROSE WOOD CRADLE PACKED EIGHTY MILES BY MULE HAD IN STUMPY'S WAY OF PUTTING IT SORTER KILLED THE REST OF THE FURNITURE
THAT DESCENDED THE HILLSIDES
THE MASTER CHOKED UP AGAIN BUT SQUEEZING THE CUSHION OF THE TABLE IN HIS GLOVED HAND HE WENT ON IF YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN I HAVE ONLY TO TELL YOU THAT I AM HER GUARDIAN AND RESPONSIBLE FOR HER CAREER YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THE KIND OF LIFE YOU OFFER HER
WELL IF SHE WERE IN LOVE WITH HIM IT WAS A VERY UNFORTUNATE THING WHY SAID MLISS WITH AN UPWARD SWEEP OF THE DROOPING LID OH WELL HE COULDN'T SUPPORT HIS WIFE AT HIS PRESENT SALARY
THAN THE ANCIENT TREATMENT OF ROMULUS AND REMUS AND APPARENTLY AS SUCCESSFUL WHEN THESE DETAILS WERE COMPLETED WHICH EXHAUSTED ANOTHER HOUR THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND THE ANXIOUS CROWD OF MEN
A LONG RAMBLING BUILDING CONTAINING A BARROOM BILLIARD ROOM AND RESTAURANT AS THE YOUNG MAN CROSSED THE PLAZA HE NOTICED THAT TWO OR THREE OF THE PASSERS BY TURNED AND LOOKED AFTER HIM HE LOOKED AT HIS CLOTHES TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS FACE BEFORE HE ENTERED THE BARROOM
HE DRANK QUITE FREELY AND RELATED WITH GREAT GUSTO HIS EXPERIENCE INVARIABLY ENDING WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC CONDEMNATION OF THE NEWCOMER

EXCEEDED ALL SHE COULD BELIEVE POSSIBLE
I RATHER WONDER NOW AT YOUR KNOWING ANY ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
OH MAMMA DO THE PEOPLE HEREABOUTS KNOW I AM MARRIED TO DAY I WAS AFRAID THEY MIGHT NOT AND WE OVERTOOK WILLIAM GOULDING IN HIS CURRICLE
BEEN LED TO MAKE MISTER DARCY ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR FEARS FOR HER SISTER FOR SINCE HER MARRIAGE WOULD SO SHORTLY GIVE THE PROPER TERMINATION TO THE ELOPEMENT
MY REASONS FOR BELIEVING IT ARE BRIEFLY THESE IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT MY HAND IS UNWORTHY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OR THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT I CAN OFFER WOULD BE ANY OTHER THAN HIGHLY DESIRABLE
BUT THE CASE IS THIS WE ARE NOT RICH ENOUGH OR GRAND ENOUGH FOR THEM AND SHE IS THE MORE ANXIOUS TO GET MISS DARCY FOR HER BROTHER FROM THE NOTION THAT WHEN THERE HAS BEEN ONE INTERMARRIAGE SHE MAY HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN ACHIEVING A SECOND
THAT IT IS THE PARTICULAR ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE VERY NOBLE LADY WHOM I HAVE THE HONOUR OF CALLING PATRONESS TWICE HAS SHE CONDESCENDED TO GIVE ME HER OPINION
SHE TURNED FROM SISTER TO SISTER DEMANDING THEIR CONGRATULATIONS AND WHEN AT LENGTH THEY ALL SAT DOWN LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND THE ROOM
BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN WHO LIVED ONLY TO EAT DRINK AND PLAY AT CARDS WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE
AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
COME AS SOON AS YOU CAN ON RECEIPT OF THIS MY BROTHER AND THE GENTLEMEN ARE TO DINE WITH THE OFFICERS YOURS EVER CAROLINE BINGLEY WITH THE OFFICERS CRIED LYDIA I WONDER MY AUNT DID NOT TELL US OF THAT
SIR YOU QUITE MISUNDERSTAND ME SAID MISSUS BENNET ALARMED LIZZY IS ONLY HEADSTRONG IN SUCH MATTERS AS THESE IN EVERYTHING ELSE SHE IS AS GOOD NATURED A GIRL AS EVER LIVED
FEELING IT INCUMBENT ON HER TO RELIEVE HIM FROM SO UNPLEASANT A SITUATION NOW PUT HERSELF FORWARD TO CONFIRM HIS ACCOUNT BY MENTIONING HER PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF IT FROM CHARLOTTE HERSELF
THIS WAS ONE POINT WITH REGARD TO LYDIA AT LEAST WHICH WAS NOW TO BE SETTLED AND MISTER BENNET COULD HAVE NO HESITATION IN ACCEDING TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE HIM IN TERMS OF GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR THE KINDNESS OF HIS BROTHER THOUGH EXPRESSED MOST CONCISELY
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE DISCUSSION OF MISTER COLLINS'S OFFER WAS NOW NEARLY AT AN END AND ELIZABETH HAD ONLY TO SUFFER FROM THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS NECESSARILY ATTENDING IT
NEGLECT I AM SURE YOU NEGLECT NOTHING THAT CAN ADD TO THE BEAUTIES OF THAT NOBLE PLACE CHARLES WHEN YOU BUILD YOUR HOUSE I WISH IT MAY BE HALF AS DELIGHTFUL AS PEMBERLEY I WISH IT MAY
THAT YOU SHOULD BE SO READY TO THINK YOUR OWN CHILDREN SILLY IF I WISHED TO THINK SLIGHTINGLY OF ANYBODY'S CHILDREN IT SHOULD NOT BE OF MY OWN HOWEVER IF MY CHILDREN ARE SILLY I MUST HOPE TO BE ALWAYS SENSIBLE OF IT
I SHOULD NOT MIND ANYTHING AT ALL LET US BE THANKFUL THAT YOU ARE PRESERVED FROM A STATE OF SUCH INSENSIBILITY
HAVING NEVER EVEN FANCIED HERSELF IN LOVE BEFORE HER REGARD HAD ALL THE WARMTH OF FIRST ATTACHMENT AND FROM HER AGE AND DISPOSITION GREATER STEADINESS THAN MOST FIRST ATTACHMENTS OFTEN BOAST
WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL
SHE IS WELL AND BEGS TO BE DUTIFULLY REMEMBERED TO YOU AND YOUR MOTHER YOURS ET CETERA E GARDINER MISTER BENNET AND HIS DAUGHTERS SAW ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF WICKHAM'S REMOVAL FROM THE SHIRE
JANE CONFESSED HERSELF A LITTLE SURPRISED AT THE MATCH BUT SHE SAID LESS OF HER ASTONISHMENT THAN OF HER EARNEST DESIRE FOR THEIR HAPPINESS NOR COULD ELIZABETH PERSUADE HER TO CONSIDER IT AS IMPROBABLE
AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
HE IMAGINED THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TO LONDON MIGHT BE CONCLUDED IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN IT CANNOT BE SO AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVINCED THAT WHEN CHARLES GETS TO TOWN HE WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE IT AGAIN
ON THIS SUBJECT AND IT WAS BUT THE VERY SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE I LEFT HUNSFORD BETWEEN OUR POOLS AT QUADRILLE WHILE MISSUS JENKINSON WAS ARRANGING MISS DE BOURGH'S FOOTSTOOL THAT SHE SAID MISTER COLLINS YOU MUST MARRY
NOR DID THAT DAY WEAR OUT HER RESENTMENT A WEEK ELAPSED BEFORE SHE COULD SEE ELIZABETH WITHOUT SCOLDING HER A MONTH PASSED AWAY BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK TO SIR WILLIAM OR LADY LUCAS WITHOUT BEING RUDE
HER SISTER SCARCELY LESS SO AND AS FOR MISTER HURST BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN WHO LIVED ONLY TO EAT DRINK AND PLAY AT CARDS WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER
DO NOT GIVE WAY TO SUCH GLOOMY THOUGHTS LET US HOPE FOR BETTER THINGS LET US FLATTER OURSELVES THAT I MAY BE THE SURVIVOR THIS WAS NOT VERY CONSOLING TO MISSUS BENNET
I THOUGHT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET LOOKED REMARKABLY WELL WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM THIS MORNING HER DIRTY PETTICOAT QUITE ESCAPED MY NOTICE YOU OBSERVED IT MISTER DARCY I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE YOUR SISTER MAKE SUCH AN EXHIBITION
IT WAS VERY STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD COME TO LONGBOURN INSTEAD OF TO LUCAS LODGE IT WAS ALSO VERY INCONVENIENT AND EXCEEDINGLY TROUBLESOME SHE HATED HAVING VISITORS IN THE HOUSE WHILE HER HEALTH WAS SO INDIFFERENT
AND YOU MAY BE VERY CERTAIN THAT I SHALL AVAIL MYSELF OF IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED AND MISTER BENNET WHO COULD BY NO MEANS WISH FOR SO SPEEDY A RETURN
THE SISTERS ON HEARING THIS REPEATED THREE OR FOUR TIMES HOW MUCH THEY WERE GRIEVED HOW SHOCKING IT WAS TO HAVE A BAD COLD AND HOW EXCESSIVELY THEY DISLIKED BEING ILL THEMSELVES AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER
WHO WERE USUALLY TEMPTED THITHER THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK TO PAY THEIR DUTY TO THEIR AUNT AND TO A MILLINER'S SHOP JUST OVER THE WAY THE TWO YOUNGEST OF THE FAMILY CATHERINE AND LYDIA WERE PARTICULARLY FREQUENT IN THESE ATTENTIONS THEIR MINDS WERE MORE VACANT THAN THEIR SISTERS
FOR MISSUS BENNET WITH MORE PERSEVERANCE THAN POLITENESS PROTESTED HE MUST BE ENTIRELY MISTAKEN AND LYDIA ALWAYS UNGUARDED AND OFTEN UNCIVIL BOISTEROUSLY EXCLAIMED
AND THE BOYS WERE RELIEVED FROM THEIR APPREHENSION OF CHARLOTTE'S DYING AN OLD MAID CHARLOTTE HERSELF WAS TOLERABLY COMPOSED SHE HAD GAINED HER POINT AND HAD TIME TO CONSIDER OF IT
I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF UNDERSTANDING YOU SAID HE
AND IMMEDIATELY AND IN SILENCE WITHDREW DETERMINED IF HE PERSISTED IN CONSIDERING HER REPEATED REFUSALS AS FLATTERING ENCOURAGEMENT TO APPLY TO HER FATHER WHOSE NEGATIVE MIGHT BE UTTERED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE DECISIVE
LIKE MYSELF TO SET THE EXAMPLE OF MATRIMONY IN HIS PARISH SECONDLY THAT I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WILL ADD VERY GREATLY TO MY HAPPINESS AND THIRDLY WHICH PERHAPS I OUGHT TO HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER
AND GATHERING HER WORK TOGETHER SHE WAS HASTENING AWAY WHEN ELIZABETH CALLED OUT DEAR MADAM DO NOT GO I BEG YOU WILL NOT GO MISTER COLLINS MUST EXCUSE ME HE CAN HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ME THAT ANYBODY NEED NOT HEAR I AM GOING AWAY MYSELF
SHE FOLLOWS HIM TO TOWN IN HOPE OF KEEPING HIM THERE AND TRIES TO PERSUADE YOU THAT HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU JANE SHOOK HER HEAD INDEED JANE YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE ME
I WISH IT MAY BE HALF AS DELIGHTFUL AS PEMBERLEY I WISH IT MAY BUT I WOULD REALLY ADVISE YOU TO MAKE YOUR PURCHASE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TAKE PEMBERLEY FOR A KIND OF MODEL
RELATED THE EVENT OF THE DAY BEFORE THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTER COLLINS'S FANCYING HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER FRIEND HAD ONCE OCCURRED TO ELIZABETH WITHIN THE LAST DAY OR TWO BUT THAT CHARLOTTE COULD ENCOURAGE HIM
HIS LETTER WAS SOON DISPATCHED FOR THOUGH DILATORY IN UNDERTAKING BUSINESS
I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE I AM NOT ROMANTIC YOU KNOW I NEVER WAS I ASK ONLY A COMFORTABLE HOME AND CONSIDERING MISTER COLLINS'S CHARACTER
ESPECIALLY WHEN TEMPERED WITH THE SILENCE AND RESPECT WHICH HER RANK WILL INEVITABLY EXCITE THUS MUCH FOR MY GENERAL INTENTION IN FAVOUR OF MATRIMONY IT REMAINS TO BE TOLD WHY MY VIEWS WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS LONGBOURN INSTEAD OF MY OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
OF MY ROOM I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE THE LIBRARY TO MYSELF AS SOON AS MAY BE NOT YET HOWEVER IN SPITE OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER HUSBAND DID MISSUS BENNET GIVE UP THE POINT
AND IF UPON MATURE DELIBERATION YOU FIND THAT THE MISERY OF DISOBLIGING HIS TWO SISTERS IS MORE THAN EQUIVALENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF BEING HIS WIFE I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO REFUSE HIM
MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE
I DO NOT TRUST MY OWN PARTIALITY WHEN SHE WAS ONLY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A MAN AT MY BROTHER GARDINER'S IN TOWN SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT MY SISTER IN LAW WAS SURE HE WOULD MAKE HER AN OFFER BEFORE WE CAME AWAY
HE REPLIED THEY WERE BRIGHTENED BY THE EXERCISE A SHORT PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS SPEECH AND MISSUS HURST BEGAN AGAIN I HAVE AN EXCESSIVE REGARD FOR MISS JANE BENNET SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL
MISTER COLLINS'S RETURN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE WAS NO LONGER A MATTER OF PLEASURE TO MISSUS BENNET ON THE CONTRARY SHE WAS AS MUCH DISPOSED TO COMPLAIN OF IT AS HER HUSBAND
AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
THE STRANGENESS OF MISTER COLLINS'S MAKING TWO OFFERS OF MARRIAGE WITHIN THREE DAYS WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON OF HIS BEING NOW ACCEPTED SHE HAD ALWAYS FELT THAT CHARLOTTE'S OPINION OF MATRIMONY WAS NOT EXACTLY LIKE HER OWN
MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
AND HAVING NO FEELINGS OF DIFFIDENCE TO MAKE IT DISTRESSING TO HIMSELF EVEN AT THE MOMENT HE SET ABOUT IT IN A VERY ORDERLY MANNER WITH ALL THE OBSERVANCES WHICH HE SUPPOSED A REGULAR PART OF THE BUSINESS ON FINDING MISSUS BENNET ELIZABETH
STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND BE SATISFIED THAT WE SHALL TAKE NO OFFENCE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MY GRATITUDE IS WARMLY EXCITED BY SUCH AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION
AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT
THE BENNETS WERE ENGAGED TO DINE WITH THE LUCASES AND AGAIN DURING THE CHIEF OF THE DAY WAS MISS LUCAS SO KIND AS TO LISTEN TO MISTER COLLINS ELIZABETH TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING HER
YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT OH CERTAINLY CRIED HIS FAITHFUL ASSISTANT NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING
IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT ANOTHER OFFER OF MARRIAGE MAY EVER BE MADE YOU YOUR PORTION IS UNHAPPILY SO SMALL THAT IT WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD UNDO THE EFFECTS OF YOUR LOVELINESS AND AMIABLE QUALIFICATIONS
TILL LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH
SURELY THERE CAN BE NO OCCASION FOR EXPOSING HIM SO DREADFULLY WHAT IS YOUR OPINION THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE ATTEMPTED MISTER DARCY HAS NOT AUTHORISED ME TO MAKE HIS COMMUNICATION PUBLIC
THEY SEEMED EACH OF THEM TO HAVE THE HAPPIEST MEMORIES IN THE WORLD NOTHING OF THE PAST WAS RECOLLECTED WITH PAIN AND LYDIA LED VOLUNTARILY TO SUBJECTS WHICH HER SISTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLUDED TO FOR THE WORLD ONLY THINK OF ITS BEING THREE MONTHS SHE CRIED
I ADMIRE THE ACTIVITY OF YOUR BENEVOLENCE OBSERVED MARY BUT EVERY IMPULSE OF FEELING SHOULD BE GUIDED BY REASON AND IN MY OPINION EXERTION SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN PROPORTION TO WHAT IS REQUIRED WE WILL GO AS FAR AS MERYTON WITH YOU
WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN HANDSOME SHE FELT ALL THE GOOD LUCK OF IT THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE BUSINESS WAS THE SURPRISE IT MUST OCCASION TO ELIZABETH BENNET
AND WITH MANY MEN I DARE SAY IT SUCCEEDS BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS A PALTRY DEVICE A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED
MISTER COLLINS WAS ALSO IN THE SAME STATE OF ANGRY PRIDE ELIZABETH HAD HOPED THAT HIS RESENTMENT MIGHT SHORTEN HIS VISIT BUT HIS PLAN DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY IT HE WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE GONE ON SATURDAY
BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT
IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
BUT TO LIVE IN IGNORANCE ON SUCH A POINT WAS IMPOSSIBLE OR AT LEAST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TRY FOR INFORMATION
SHE ADDED IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
BUT STILL HE WOULD BE HER HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING HIGHLY EITHER OF MEN OR MATRIMONY MARRIAGE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER OBJECT
THEY ARE WANTED IN THE FARM MISTER BENNET ARE THEY NOT THEY ARE WANTED IN THE FARM MUCH OFTENER THAN I CAN GET THEM BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT THEM TO DAY SAID ELIZABETH MY MOTHER'S PURPOSE WILL BE ANSWERED
RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING
AND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FROM THE TWO ELEGANT LADIES WHO WAITED ON HIS SISTERS IN SPITE OF THIS AMENDMENT HOWEVER SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE A NOTE SENT TO LONGBOURN DESIRING HER MOTHER TO VISIT JANE AND FORM HER OWN JUDGEMENT OF HER SITUATION
AND OCCASIONALLY FROM SOME PEEVISH ALLUSIONS OF HER MOTHER AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF HIS FEELINGS WERE CHIEFLY EXPRESSED NOT BY EMBARRASSMENT OR DEJECTION OR BY TRYING TO AVOID HER
HER MISTER BENNET RAISED HIS EYES FROM HIS BOOK AS SHE ENTERED AND FIXED THEM ON HER FACE WITH A CALM UNCONCERN WHICH WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALTERED BY HER COMMUNICATION
IN INDULGING THE HOPE OF AN EVENT WHICH WILL SECURE THE HAPPINESS OF SO MANY
SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT OH CERTAINLY CRIED HIS FAITHFUL ASSISTANT
INDEED I COULD NOT I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH I MAY SAY UNHAPPY AND WITH NO ONE TO SPEAK TO ABOUT WHAT I FELT
BUT NO SUCH HAPPY MARRIAGE COULD NOW TEACH THE ADMIRING MULTITUDE WHAT CONNUBIAL FELICITY REALLY WAS
AND ON PERCEIVING WHOM SHE SAID TO THE GIRLS
NOT EXCEPTING MY COUSIN ELIZABETH WITH PROPER CIVILITIES THE LADIES THEN WITHDREW
BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO BE DANCING WHEN SHE IS ILL LYDIA DECLARED HERSELF SATISFIED
THAN SHE ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND CONGRATULATED BOTH HIM AND HERSELF
THE PRINCIPAL PURPORT OF HIS LETTER WAS TO INFORM THEM THAT MISTER WICKHAM HAD RESOLVED ON QUITTING THE MILITIA IT WAS GREATLY MY WISH THAT HE SHOULD DO SO HE ADDED AS SOON AS HIS MARRIAGE WAS FIXED ON
BEFORE ELIZABETH HAD TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT A BLUSH OF SURPRISE MISSUS BENNET ANSWERED INSTANTLY OH DEAR YES CERTAINLY I AM SURE LIZZY WILL BE VERY HAPPY I AM SURE SHE CAN HAVE NO OBJECTION COME KITTY
AFTER THE IRRITATING DISCUSSION WITH HIS BROTHER HE PONDERED OVER THIS INTENTION AGAIN I MUST HAVE PHYSICAL EXERCISE OR MY TEMPER'LL CERTAINLY BE RUINED HE THOUGHT AND HE DETERMINED HE WOULD GO MOWING HOWEVER AWKWARD HE MIGHT FEEL ABOUT IT WITH HIS BROTHER OR THE PEASANTS
AND SHOWED HIM ALL THE INCORRECTNESS OF HIS VIEW AS FOR YOUR DISLIKE OF IT EXCUSE MY SAYING SO THAT'S SIMPLY OUR RUSSIAN SLOTH AND OLD SERF OWNER'S WAYS AND I'M CONVINCED THAT IN YOU IT'S A TEMPORARY ERROR AND WILL PASS KONSTANTIN WAS SILENT
THEY WERE MOWING SLOWLY OVER THE UNEVEN LOW LYING PARTS OF THE MEADOW WHERE THERE HAD BEEN AN OLD DAM LEVIN RECOGNIZED SOME OF HIS OWN MEN HERE WAS OLD YERMIL IN A VERY LONG WHITE SMOCK BENDING FORWARD TO SWING A SCYTHE
BESIDES I WANT TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF COMPLETELY NOW I'VE DONE SILLY THINGS OF COURSE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE BUT MONEY'S THE LAST CONSIDERATION I DON'T REGRET IT SO LONG AS THERE'S HEALTH AND MY HEALTH THANK GOD IS QUITE RESTORED
THE STEWARD DID NOT TAKE UP MUCH TIME HE SIMPLY GAVE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH THE MONEY HE NEEDED
THE BAILIFF WHO HAD BEEN TO THE MERCHANT HAD COME BACK AND BROUGHT PART OF THE MONEY FOR THE WHEAT AN AGREEMENT HAD BEEN MADE WITH THE OLD SERVANT AND ON THE ROAD THE BAILIFF HAD LEARNED THAT EVERYWHERE THE CORN WAS STILL STANDING IN THE FIELDS
AND ITS BEING ME KOSTYA LEVIN WHO WENT TO A BALL IN A BLACK TIE AND WAS REFUSED BY THE SHTCHERBATSKAYA GIRL AND WHO WAS INTRINSICALLY SUCH A PITIFUL WORTHLESS CREATURE THAT PROVES NOTHING I FEEL SURE FRANKLIN FELT JUST AS WORTHLESS
PLUCKING UP HIS COURAGE BUT HAVING ONCE MADE UP HIS MIND HE WENT ON IN HIS SHRILL VOICE WITHOUT TIMIDITY OR HESITATION ACCENTUATING HERE AND THERE A WORD I HAVE THE MISFORTUNE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH BEGAN
PROCEEDED TO WALK THROUGH THE GALLERIES THE GALLERIES WERE FULL OF FASHIONABLY DRESSED LADIES LEANING OVER THE BALUSTRADE AND TRYING NOT TO LOSE A SINGLE WORD OF WHAT WAS BEING SAID BELOW
SITTING IN A SIDE SADDLE NAY A MAN SEE HOW SMARTLY HE'S GOING IT
HE SIMPLY SEEMED AS THOUGH HE WERE RESENTING SOME AFFRONT IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST PAINFUL TO ME IT HAPPENED OF ITSELF SHE SAID IRRITABLY AND SEE SHE PULLED HER HUSBAND'S LETTER OUT OF HER GLOVE
YOU KNOW MY NAME ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH RESUMED I KNOW YOU AND THE GOOD AGAIN HE CAUGHT A MOTH WORK YOU ARE DOING LIKE EVERY RUSSIAN SAID THE LAWYER BOWING ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SIGHED
SHE HAD REFUSED TO SEE HER HUSBAND IT'S THAT IDIOTIC SMILE THAT'S TO BLAME FOR IT ALL THOUGHT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH BUT WHAT'S TO BE DONE WHAT'S TO BE DONE HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN DESPAIR
WAS THE WORD SON WHICH SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO PRONOUNCE WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER SON AND HIS FUTURE ATTITUDE TO HIS MOTHER WHO HAD ABANDONED HIS FATHER SHE FELT SUCH TERROR
WHO WAS POURING CABBAGE SOUP INTO A BOWL LAUGHING MOST MERRILY OF ALL VERY PROBABLY THE GOOD LOOKING FACE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE CLOGS HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO WITH THE IMPRESSION OF WELL BEING THIS PEASANT HOUSEHOLD MADE UPON LEVIN
THE LETTER WAS SO STRANGE FIRST ANNIE ILL AND THEN YOU THOUGHT OF COMING YOURSELF IT WAS ALL THE TRUTH OH I DON'T DOUBT IT YES YOU DO DOUBT IT
YOU HAVE SEEN HIM YOU KNOW BETSY'S ADMIRER NOW HE'S BEEN THROWN OVER AND HE'S COME TO SEE US AS ALEXEY SAYS HE'S ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY PLEASANT IF ONE ACCEPTS THEM FOR WHAT THEY TRY TO APPEAR TO BE
YOU LOVE ANOTHER MAN AND HAVE ENTERED INTO CRIMINAL INTRIGUES WITH HIM MIMICKING HER HUSBAND SHE THREW AN EMPHASIS ON THE WORD CRIMINAL AS ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH DID
WAS THE CHANGE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN ANNA WHOM SHE KNEW SO WELL AND LOVED ANY OTHER WOMAN A LESS CLOSE OBSERVER NOT KNOWING ANNA BEFORE OR NOT HAVING THOUGHT AS DARYA ALEXANDROVNA HAD BEEN THINKING ON THE ROAD
ANNA HAD PUT ON A VERY SIMPLE BATISTE GOWN DOLLY SCRUTINIZED THAT SIMPLE GOWN ATTENTIVELY SHE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT AND THE PRICE AT WHICH SUCH SIMPLICITY WAS OBTAINED
WHEN SHE GOT HER HUSBAND'S LETTER SHE KNEW THEN AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART THAT EVERYTHING WOULD GO ON IN THE OLD WAY THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH OF WILL TO FOREGO HER POSITION TO ABANDON HER SON AND TO JOIN HER LOVER
BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALL SEATED LEVIN TURNED AND WENT OUT KITTY SAW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH HER HUSBAND SHE TRIED TO SEIZE A MOMENT TO SPEAK TO HIM ALONE BUT HE MADE HASTE TO GET AWAY FROM HER
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU NOW YOU MAY BEG AS YOU PLEASE BUT I WON'T BE OPEN WITH YOU SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU HE SAID MENTALLY LIKE A MAN WHO AFTER VAINLY ATTEMPTING TO EXTINGUISH A FIRE SHOULD FLY IN A RAGE WITH HIS VAIN EFFORTS AND SAY
IN A NEW CHAR A BANC WITH A BIG RAVEN BLACK TROTTING HORSE OVERTOOK THE PARTY ON HORSEBACK ANNA'S FACE SUDDENLY BEAMED WITH A JOYFUL SMILE AT THE INSTANT WHEN
HE FELT A PLEASANT SENSATION OF CHILL ON HIS HOT MOIST SHOULDERS HE GLANCED AT THE SKY IN THE INTERVAL FOR WHETTING THE SCYTHES A HEAVY LOWERING STORM CLOUD HAD BLOWN UP AND BIG RAINDROPS WERE FALLING SOME OF THE PEASANTS WENT TO THEIR COATS AND PUT THEM ON
IF IT IS NOT FOUNDED ON SELF INTEREST THAT'S A UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE A PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLE HE SAID REPEATING THE WORD PHILOSOPHICAL WITH DETERMINATION AS THOUGH WISHING TO SHOW THAT HE HAD AS MUCH RIGHT AS ANY ONE ELSE TO TALK OF PHILOSOPHY
AT TEA THE SAME EVENING LEVIN SAID TO HIS BROTHER I FANCY THE FINE WEATHER WILL LAST TOMORROW I SHALL START MOWING I'M SO FOND OF THAT FORM OF FIELD LABOR SAID SERGEY IVANOVITCH I'M AWFULLY FOND OF IT
HE CONSIDERED HUMAN LIFE ONLY TOLERABLE ABROAD AND WENT ABROAD TO STAY AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND AT THE SAME TIME HE CARRIED ON A COMPLEX AND IMPROVED SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURE IN RUSSIA
SINCERE AND TENDER NEVER SPEAK TO ME OF THAT BUT ANNA NEVER LEAVE IT TO ME
NOTICING THE CHANGE OF HER FACE AT THE CHILD'S CRY MY CHILD HOW CAN SHE HATE ME DOLLY ONE WORD MORE HE SAID FOLLOWING HER IF YOU COME NEAR ME I WILL CALL IN THE SERVANTS THE CHILDREN THEY MAY ALL KNOW YOU ARE A SCOUNDREL I AM GOING AWAY AT ONCE AND YOU MAY LIVE HERE WITH YOUR MISTRESS
I HAVE ONLY TO GO STUBBORNLY ON TOWARDS MY AIM AND I SHALL ATTAIN MY END THOUGHT LEVIN AND IT'S SOMETHING TO WORK AND TAKE TROUBLE FOR THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF MYSELF INDIVIDUALLY THE QUESTION OF THE PUBLIC WELFARE COMES INTO IT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF CULTURE
THEY'LL OPEN THE DOOR NO I'LL GO IN FROM THE GARDEN AND FEELING SATISFIED THAT SHE WAS ALONE
AND BANKING COMPANIES THAT TOO IS PROFIT WITHOUT WORK YES THAT MAY ALL BE VERY TRUE AND CLEVER LIE DOWN KRAK STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH CALLED TO HIS DOG
ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH WAS IN PRINCIPLE IN FAVOR OF THE PUBLICITY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THOUGH FOR SOME HIGHER OFFICIAL CONSIDERATIONS HE DISLIKED THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE IN RUSSIA
ON HIS WAY BACK HE CAUGHT UNOBSERVED ANOTHER MOTH NICE STATE MY REP CURTAINS WILL BE IN BY THE SUMMER HE THOUGHT FROWNING AND SO YOU WERE SAYING HE SAID
PERHAPS SO SAID LEVIN DRYLY AND HE TURNED ON HIS SIDE TOMORROW EARLY I WANT TO GO SHOOTING AND I WON'T WAKE ANYONE AND SHALL SET OFF AT DAYBREAK
SKIPPING ALONG THE AVENUE AND SOME ONE ELSE TOO PAPA OF COURSE CRIED LEVIN STOPPING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE AVENUE KITTY DON'T COME DOWN THE STEEP STAIRCASE GO ROUND
AS PRINCESS VARVARA SAYS THEN VESLOVSKY YOU KNOW HIM
THE SOLE DIFFERENCE LAY IN THE FACT THAT HE WAS MORE BUSILY OCCUPIED THAN EVER
THAT'S AS IT HAPPENS BUT HERE'S FOR THE HOUSEKEEPING HE SAID TAKING TEN ROUBLES FROM HIS POCKETBOOK THAT'LL BE ENOUGH ENOUGH OR NOT ENOUGH WE MUST MAKE IT DO SAID MATVEY SLAMMING THE CARRIAGE DOOR AND STEPPING BACK ONTO THE STEPS
AND DEIGNING TO BESTOW MY LOVE ON HER WHAT INDUCED DARYA ALEXANDROVNA TO TELL ME THAT BY CHANCE I MIGHT HAVE SEEN HER THEN EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED OF ITSELF BUT AS IT IS IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION OUT OF THE QUESTION
NOT A WHIT ABASHED BY THE DISAPPOINTMENT CAUSED BY HIS HAVING COME IN PLACE OF THE OLD PRINCE VESLOVSKY GREETED LEVIN GAILY CLAIMING ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM IN THE PAST AND SNATCHING UP GRISHA INTO THE CARRIAGE
AND THEN MADE ANOTHER STEP FORWARD WITH HER LITTLE ARMS BUT THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE OF THE NURSERY AND ESPECIALLY THE ENGLISH NURSE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA DID NOT LIKE AT ALL
AT EVERY WORD ANNA SAID THE ENGLISH NURSE SAID HURRIEDLY SEVERAL TIMES YES MY LADY THE ROSY BABY WITH HER BLACK EYEBROWS AND HAIR HER STURDY RED LITTLE BODY WITH TIGHT GOOSE FLESH SKIN
HIM WITH TENFOLD INTENSITY THAT STRANGE FEELING OF LOATHING OF SOMEONE BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THAT THE TURNING POINT HE HAD BEEN LONGING FOR HAD COME NOW THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO ON CONCEALING THINGS FROM HER HUSBAND
AND FROM THEIR HOSTILE AND SUSPICIOUS GLANCES FROM THE SILENCE THAT FELL UPON THEM WHEN OUTSIDERS APPROACHED A GROUP AND FROM THE WAY THAT SOME WHISPERING TOGETHER RETREATED TO THE FARTHER CORRIDOR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT EACH SIDE HAD SECRETS FROM THE OTHER
HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BECOME AGITATED OVER WHAT WAS THE AFFAIR OF HER CONSCIENCE AND WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE BARRIER HE FANCIED BETWEEN THEM
A FLASH OF EAGERNESS SUFFUSED THE FACE OF ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH AS HE RAPIDLY WROTE OUT A SYNOPSIS OF THESE IDEAS FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT HAVING FILLED A SHEET OF PAPER HE GOT UP
SO AS TO TRY NOT TO BREAK THE WINNOWING MACHINES THE HORSE RAKES THE THRASHING MACHINES THAT HE SHOULD ATTEND TO WHAT HE WAS DOING
ON THE FOURTH DAY THE AUDITING OF THE MARSHAL'S ACCOUNTS TOOK PLACE AT THE HIGH TABLE OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE AND THEN THERE OCCURRED THE FIRST SKIRMISH BETWEEN THE NEW PARTY AND THE OLD
AND THEREBY TO BE OF THE GREATEST BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY THE SERVANT HAD SET THE TEA AND LEFT THE ROOM ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH GOT UP AND WENT TO THE WRITING TABLE
PROUD SHE COULD NOT SAY WHAT SHE WAS PROUD OF TEARS OF SHAME AND DESPAIR CHOKED HER UTTERANCE SHE STOOD STILL AND SOBBED HE FELT TOO SOMETHING SWELLING IN HIS THROAT AND TWITCHING IN HIS NOSE
DURING THE TIME OF THE CHILDREN'S TEA THE GROWN UP PEOPLE SAT IN THE BALCONY AND TALKED AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THOUGH THEY ALL ESPECIALLY SERGEY IVANOVITCH AND VARENKA
OH HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO BEGIN TO SPEAK BUT COULD NOT HE WAITED YOU REMEMBER THE CHILDREN STIVA TO PLAY WITH THEM BUT I REMEMBER THEM AND KNOW THAT THIS MEANS THEIR RUIN SHE SAID
SO FAR AS NOT TRYING TO INCREASE THE DIFFERENCE OF POSITION EXISTING BETWEEN HIM AND ME NO EXCUSE ME THAT'S A PARADOX YES THERE'S SOMETHING OF A SOPHISTRY ABOUT THAT VESLOVSKY AGREED
NO GUARANTEE WHOSE WHAT THEY WON'T PASS HIM NO GUARANTEE THEY WON'T LET FLEROV IN EH BECAUSE OF THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM WHY AT THIS RATE THEY WON'T ADMIT ANYONE IT'S A SWINDLE THE LAW
I DON'T KNOW BUT IF YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT I'M NOT AT ALL CONVINCED ON THE CONTRARY I FEEL I HAVE NO RIGHT TO GIVE IT UP THAT I HAVE DUTIES BOTH TO THE LAND AND TO MY FAMILY
SHE NOTICED IT AND ASKED HIM THE REASON TO HIM KNOWING THAT EVERY JOY EVERY PLEASURE AND PAIN THAT SHE FELT SHE COMMUNICATED TO HIM AT ONCE TO HIM NOW TO SEE THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO NOTICE HIS STATE OF MIND
THERE IS A WAY OUT OF EVERY POSITION WE MUST TAKE OUR LINE HE SAID ANYTHING'S BETTER THAN THE POSITION IN WHICH YOU'RE LIVING OF COURSE I SEE HOW YOU TORTURE YOURSELF OVER EVERYTHING THE WORLD AND YOUR SON AND YOUR HUSBAND
WAS AS FRESH AND GAY AND STRONG AS HE WAS HIMSELF THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES SHINING IN THE RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN THE SHARP OUTLINES OF FENCES AND ANGLES OF BUILDINGS THE FIGURES OF PASSERS BY THE CARRIAGES THAT MET HIM NOW AND THEN
BUT HE FELT THAT HE WAS TO BLAME FOR THE VERY FACT OF THE LOW NECKED BODICE HAVING BEEN MADE IT SEEMED TO LEVIN THAT HE HAD DECEIVED SOMEONE THAT HE OUGHT TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING BUT THAT TO EXPLAIN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THAT WAS AS I HAD SUPPOSED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ANGER HE APPARENTLY REGAINED COMPLETE POSSESSION OF ALL HIS FACULTIES BUT AS I TOLD YOU THEN AND HAVE WRITTEN TO YOU
THE WHOLE AIM OF HER EXISTENCE IS TO PROVE HER SUPERIORITY OVER AUNTIE KATERINA PAVLOVNA THAT'S ALL TRUE BUT SHE'S A GOOD NATURED WOMAN AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO HER
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE FELT ON THE POINT OF WEEPING HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS TOUCHED HIM SO HE FELT SORRY FOR HER AND HE FELT HE COULD NOT HELP HER AND WITH THAT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS TO BLAME FOR HER WRETCHEDNESS
THOUGH WITH MUCH EMBARRASSMENT AND ANXIETY NOT TO MORTIFY LEVIN THAT THEY MUST KEEP STRICTLY TO THE BOOK AS THE TEACHER HAD DONE AND THAT SHE HAD BETTER UNDERTAKE IT AGAIN HERSELF LEVIN WAS AMAZED BOTH AT STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH
URGING THEM TO ELECT THE PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES NOT FROM REGARD FOR PERSONS BUT FOR THE SERVICE AND WELFARE OF THEIR FATHERLAND AND HOPING THAT THE HONORABLE NOBILITY OF THE KASHINSKY PROVINCE WOULD AS AT ALL FORMER ELECTIONS
SHE WALKED ON A FEW STEPS IN SILENCE GATHERING UP HER COURAGE THEN SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED I DID NOT TELL YOU YESTERDAY SHE BEGAN BREATHING QUICKLY AND PAINFULLY THAT COMING HOME WITH ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING
TO MYSELF AND TO GOD TO POINT OUT TO YOU YOUR DUTIES OUR LIFE HAS BEEN JOINED NOT BY MAN BUT BY GOD THAT UNION CAN ONLY BE SEVERED BY A CRIME AND A CRIME OF THAT NATURE BRINGS ITS OWN CHASTISEMENT
HE WAS IN FRONT OF ALL AND CUT HIS WIDE ROW WITHOUT BENDING AS THOUGH PLAYING WITH THE SCYTHE LEVIN GOT OFF HIS MARE AND FASTENING HER UP BY THE ROADSIDE WENT TO MEET TIT WHO TOOK A SECOND SCYTHE OUT OF A BUSH AND GAVE IT TO HIM IT'S READY SIR
THAT NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW THE SOLICITOR CERTAINLY DID NOT KNOW
SO PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES AND EVERYONE ELSE AND THEIR WELL ORDERED HOME HAD ALWAYS A CHEERING EFFECT ON LEVIN HE FELT A LONGING NOW THAT HE WAS SO DISSATISFIED WITH HIS OWN LIFE TO GET AT THAT SECRET IN SVIAZHSKY THAT GAVE HIM SUCH CLEARNESS
I'VE ONLY JUST COME
PUT AN END TO THEIR UNNATURAL POSITION
OF CONTEMPORARY IDEAS AND TO FRAME THEIR POLICY SO AS FROM THE RIGHTS CONFERRED UPON THE NOBLES NOT AS THE NOBILITY BUT AS AN ELEMENT OF THE DISTRICT COUNCIL
HE KNEW IT WOULD AFFECT TOO MANY INTERESTS AND WOULD BE INJUDICIOUS LATER ON HE HAD BEEN ENGROSSED IN OTHER QUESTIONS AND HAD SIMPLY FORGOTTEN THE BOARD OF IRRIGATION IT WENT OF ITSELF LIKE ALL SUCH BOARDS
SINCE HIS RETURN FROM ABROAD ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HAD TWICE BEEN AT THEIR COUNTRY VILLA ONCE HE DINED THERE ANOTHER TIME HE SPENT THE EVENING THERE WITH A PARTY OF FRIENDS
DISREPUTABLE LOOKING WOMAN AS NURSE TO HER CHILD BESIDES FROM A FEW WORDS THAT WERE DROPPED DARYA ALEXANDROVNA SAW AT ONCE THAT ANNA THE TWO NURSES AND THE CHILD HAD NO COMMON EXISTENCE
BUT WILL TAKE ALL MEASURES IN HIS POWER TO PREVENT SCANDAL AND HE WILL CALMLY AND PUNCTUALLY ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS WORDS THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN HE'S NOT A MAN BUT A MACHINE
AND THEN TO CHECK THE BOY'S QUESTIONS HE SAID GO TO SLEEP VASKA GO TO SLEEP OR YOU'LL CATCH IT AND SOON AFTER HE BEGAN SNORING HIMSELF AND EVERYTHING WAS STILL HE COULD ONLY HEAR THE SNORT OF THE HORSES
FILLING HER HEART WITH SUCH PLEASURE THAT THE TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND SHE FORGAVE THE DELINQUENT HERSELF THE CULPRIT WAS SITTING AT THE WINDOW IN THE CORNER OF THE DRAWING ROOM
IT WAS ALL EASY WHILE TO HER IT WAS SUCH TORTURE TODAY THIS THOUGHT GAINED SPECIAL POIGNANCY
THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE NATURAL BESIDE ANNA ON A HOT LOOKING GRAY CAVALRY HORSE WAS VASSENKA VESLOVSKY IN HIS SCOTCH CAP WITH FLOATING RIBBONS
ON THE WAY HOME THE CHILDREN FELT THAT SOMETHING SOLEMN HAD HAPPENED AND WERE VERY SEDATE EVERYTHING WENT HAPPILY AT HOME TOO BUT AT LUNCH GRISHA BEGAN WHISTLING
WITH ITS GRAYISH RIDGES OF CUT GRASS AND THE BLACK HEAPS OF COATS TAKEN OFF BY THE MOWERS AT THE PLACE FROM WHICH THEY HAD STARTED CUTTING GRADUALLY AS HE RODE TOWARDS THE MEADOW THE PEASANTS CAME INTO SIGHT SOME IN COATS SOME IN THEIR SHIRTS MOWING
AND WHAT WAS WORSE WAS DISOBEDIENT TO THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS AND WAS FORBIDDEN TO HAVE ANY TART DARYA ALEXANDROVNA WOULD NOT HAVE LET THINGS GO SO FAR ON SUCH A DAY HAD SHE BEEN PRESENT
NO THAT'S UNFAIR SAID VESLOVSKY HOW COULD ENVY COME IN THERE IS SOMETHING NOT NICE ABOUT THAT SORT OF BUSINESS YOU SAY LEVIN WENT ON THAT IT'S UNJUST FOR ME TO RECEIVE FIVE THOUSAND WHILE THE PEASANT HAS FIFTY
BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN IT MUST ALL END I HAD FORGOTTEN DEATH HE SAT ON HIS BED IN THE DARKNESS CROUCHED UP HUGGING HIS KNEES AND HOLDING HIS BREATH FROM THE STRAIN OF THOUGHT HE PONDERED BUT THE MORE INTENSELY HE THOUGHT THE CLEARER IT BECAME TO HIM THAT IT WAS INDUBITABLY SO
THAT THE GERMAN WAS WOUND UP FOR A WHOLE LIFETIME HIMSELF TO WIND UP WATCHES AND HE SMILED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS FOND OF A JOKE AND MAYBE SHE WILL COME ROUND THAT'S A GOOD EXPRESSION COME ROUND HE THOUGHT I MUST REPEAT THAT MATVEY HE SHOUTED
ALL UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND HIM DROVE THE PLANE HIGHER AND HIGHER INTO THE AIR TARZAN GLANCED DOWNWARD BELOW HIM THE TREE TOPS AND THE RIVER PASSED RAPIDLY TO THE REAR AND ONLY A SLENDER GRASS ROPE
THEN SHE HEARD FOOTSTEPS RUNNING RAPIDLY TOWARD SMITH OLDWICK AND AS HIS PISTOL SPOKE THERE WAS A SCREAM AND THE SOUND OF A FALLING BODY EVIDENTLY DISHEARTENED BY THE FAILURE OF THEIR FIRST ATTEMPT THE ASSAULTERS DREW OFF BUT ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME
USANGA HAD REAPED HIS REWARD AGAIN AND AGAIN THE PLANE CIRCLED ABOVE THE MEADOW THE BLACKS AT FIRST DISMAYED AT THE DEATH OF THEIR LEADER WERE NOW WORKED TO A FRENZY OF RAGE AND A DETERMINATION TO BE AVENGED
ONCE AGAIN THE ENEMY WITHDREW BUT AGAIN ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME AND NOW THEY CAME IN FULL FORCE THE LIONS AND THE MEN
SAW NOW THAT THE LATTER WAS EXPLAINING SOMETHING IN DETAIL TO HIS WARRIORS AND FROM HIS GESTURES AND HIS MANNER IT WAS APPARENT THAT HE WAS PERSUADING THEM TO SOME NEW PLAN AS WELL AS GIVING THEM INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHAT THEY WERE TO DO SEVERAL TIMES TOO
AND THE NOISE OF MANY PADDED FEET RUSHING TOWARD THEM TARZAN OF THE APES STOOD DIRECTLY BEFORE THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAVERN HIS KNIFE IN HIS HAND AWAITING THE CHARGE THE APE MAN HAD NOT EXPECTED ANY SUCH CONCERTED ACTION AS HE NOW REALIZED HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THOSE WATCHING THEM
WHAT DOES ZU TAG WANT ASKED THE APE MAN ZU TAG COMES TO THE WATER TO DRINK REPLIED THE APE WHERE IS THE TRIBE ASKED TARZAN THEY ARE HUNTING FOR PISANGS AND SCIMATINES FARTHER BACK IN THE FOREST REPLIED ZU TAG AND THE TARMANGANI SHE AND BULL ASKED TARZAN
EVEN THE SPEAR THAT HE HAD HAD WHEN CAPTURED HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM SO THAT NOW HE WAS UNARMED AND ABSOLUTELY AT THE MERCY OF THE BLACK SERGEANT AND HIS FOLLOWERS LIEUTENANT HAROLD PERCY SMITH OLDWICK
AND STRAPPED HER INTO HER SEAT AND THEN TOOK HIS OWN DIRECTLY AHEAD OF HER THE GIRL TURNED HER EYES TOWARD THE ENGLISHMAN SHE WAS VERY PALE BUT HER LIPS SMILED BRAVELY GOOD BYE SHE CRIED GOOD BYE AND GOD BLESS YOU HE CALLED BACK
COME SAID TARZAN SUDDENLY AND GRASPING THE LION'S MANE WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE MOVED TOWARD THE OTHER LIONS HIS COMPANION PACING AT HIS SIDE AS THE TWO ADVANCED THE OTHERS DREW SLOWLY BACK AND FINALLY SEPARATING MOVED OFF TO EITHER SIDE
BUT THE AVIATOR COULD NEITHER HEAR NOR UNDERSTAND THE BLACK ABOVE THE NOISE OF THE PROPELLER AND EXHAUST BY THIS TIME THE PLANE WAS MOVING ALONG THE GROUND AND EVEN THEN USANGA WAS UPON THE VERGE OF LEAPING OUT AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO
WHERE SMITH OLDWICK'S PLANE HAD LANDED HE TOOK IN THE ENTIRE SCENE IN ONE QUICK GLANCE AND GRASPED THE SITUATION ALTHOUGH HE COULD SCARCE GIVE CREDENCE TO THE THINGS HE SAW BOUND AND HELPLESS THE ENGLISH OFFICER LAY UPON THE GROUND AT ONE SIDE OF THE MEADOW
OR WHETHER IT COMES TONIGHT OR NEXT YEAR OR IN TEN YEARS AFTER IT IS OVER IT WILL BE ALL THE SAME THE GIRL SHUDDERED YES SHE SAID IN A DULL HOPELESS VOICE AFTER IT IS OVER IT WILL BE ALL THE SAME
AS THE GIRL TURNED TO BID THEM GOOD NIGHT SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE SAW A SHADOWY FORM MOVING IN THE DARKNESS BEYOND THEM
WHAT IF THEY DO CHARGE ASKED THE GIRL THERE IS NO MEANS OF ESCAPE WHY WE SHOULD HAVE TO FIGHT THEM REPLIED TARZAN WHAT CHANCE WOULD WE THREE HAVE AGAINST THEM ASKED THE GIRL THE APE MAN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
IT WAS WITH THESE THOUGHTS IN MIND THAT USANGA LAY DOWN TO SLEEP IN THE EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY CONSTANTLY HOWEVER THE THOUGHT OF NARATU AND HER TEMPER AROSE TO TAKE THE KEEN EDGE FROM HIS PLEASANT IMAGININGS IF HE COULD BUT RID HIMSELF OF HER
AND AT THE SAME TIME MADE A MOTION AS THOUGH HE WOULD ARISE IMMEDIATELY NUMA STEPPED FROM ABOVE HIM AS TARZAN RAISED HIS HEAD HE SAW THAT HE STILL LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE CLIFF
AND LAY DOWN IN THE HOT SAND TO REST NUMA WANDERED RESTLESSLY TO AND FRO AND FINALLY AFTER SPRAWLING FOR A MOMENT CLOSE BESIDE THE APE MAN ROSE AND MOVED OFF UP THE GORGE TO BE LOST TO VIEW A MOMENT LATER BEYOND THE NEAREST TURN
TURNING AND TWISTING IN MID AIR IT FELL WITH EVER INCREASING VELOCITY AND THE ENGLISHMAN HELD HIS BREATH AS THE THING HURTLED TOWARD THEM WITH A MUFFLED THUD IT FLATTENED UPON THE TURF NEAR THE CENTER OF THE MEADOW AND WHEN AT LAST THE ENGLISHMAN COULD GAIN THE COURAGE TO AGAIN TURN HIS EYES UPON IT
AND PRESENTLY MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE USANGA DISCOVERED THAT HIS TERROR WAS RAPIDLY WANING SO THAT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THERE WAS FORCED UPON HIM A CONSCIOUSNESS OF UTTER SECURITY AND THEN IT WAS THAT HE BEGAN TO TAKE NOTICE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE WHITE MAN GUIDED AND MANIPULATED THE PLANE
AND THAT NOT ONLY HIS DUTY TO THE LAND OF HIS FATHERS BUT ALSO HIS PERSONAL GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE ENEMY PEOPLE AND HIS HATRED OF THEM DEMANDED THAT HE EXPOSE THE GIRL'S PERFIDY AND YET HE HESITATED AND BECAUSE HE HESITATED HE GROWLED
YOU SAVED YOURSELF HE INSISTED FOR HAD YOU BEEN UNABLE TO PILOT THE PLANE I COULD NOT HAVE HELPED YOU AND NOW HE SAID YOU TWO HAVE THE MEANS OF RETURNING TO THE SETTLEMENTS THE DAY IS STILL YOUNG YOU CAN EASILY COVER THE DISTANCE IN A FEW HOURS IF YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT PETROL
HE NOTED THE REMNANTS OF THE UNIFORMS UPON THE BLACKS AND IMMEDIATELY HE DEMANDED TO KNOW WHERE WERE THEIR OFFICERS THEY CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU SAID THE GIRL AND SO IN THE BASTARD TONGUE THAT IS THE MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE GERMANS AND THE BLACKS OF THEIR COLONY
BUT AS YOU SEE HERE IS A MILITARY SKETCH MAP
WOULD HAVE BEEN SUICIDAL EVEN FOR THE GIANT TARMANGANI INSTEAD HE RESORTED TO METHODS OF AGILITY AND CUNNING FOR QUICK AS ARE THE GREAT CATS EVEN QUICKER IS TARZAN OF THE APES WITH OUTSPREAD RAKING TALONS AND BARED FANGS
THE THOUGHT HAVING TAKEN FORM PERSISTED BUT ALWAYS IT WAS MORE THAN OUTWEIGHED BY THE FACT THAT THE BLACK SERGEANT WAS ACTUALLY AFRAID OF HIS WOMAN SO MUCH AFRAID OF HER IN FACT THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO ATTEMPT TO PUT HER OUT OF THE WAY UNLESS HE COULD DO SO SECRETLY WHILE SHE SLEPT
SMILED AT THE CONCEIT OF THE IGNORANT AFRICAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEMANDING THAT HE BE PERMITTED TO MAKE A FLIGHT ALONE
FOR AN HOUR THE LITTLE PARTY RESTED AND THEN TARZAN SUDDENLY ROSE AND MOTIONING THE OTHERS TO SILENCE LISTENED FOR A MINUTE HE STOOD MOTIONLESS HIS KEEN EARS ACUTELY RECEPTIVE TO SOUNDS SO FAINT AND DISTANT
SINGLE MINDED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DUTY LOOK
IT HAS BEEN THERE FOR SOME TIME HADN'T YOU NOTICED IT BEFORE OH CRIED THE GIRL BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF IS IT OUR LION NO SAID TARZAN
BUT AS HE WHEELED HIS INTENDED QUARRY WHEELED WITH HIM BROWN FINGERS LOCKED IN THE HEAVY MANE ON THE POWERFUL NECK
WE WILL GO ON AGAIN BUT THE XUJANS SHE ASKED MAY THEY NOT FOLLOW US HERE YES HE SAID THEY PROBABLY WILL BUT WE NEED NOT BE CONCERNED WITH THEM UNTIL THEY COME I WISH SAID THE GIRL THAT I POSSESSED YOUR PHILOSOPHY
TARZAN WONDERED HOW THE GERMAN SPY FELT IN THIS SITUATION ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE MUST KNOW THAT THERE WAS ONE THERE WHO KNEW HER REAL STATUS HE SAW COLONEL CAPELL WALK TOWARD HER
THERE ARE SEVEN OF THEM OUT THERE NOW GOOD LORD EXCLAIMED SMITH OLDWICK COULDN'T WE BUILD A FIRE ASKED THE GIRL AND FRIGHTEN THEM AWAY
ONE MUST DIE SOMETIME HE SAID TO YOU DOUBTLESS IT MAY SEEM TERRIBLE SUCH A DEATH BUT
THAT HE HAD ENJOYED EVERY INSTANT OF THE FLIGHT AND WAS ALREADY FAR ADVANCED IN THE ART OF AVIATION SO JEALOUS WAS THE BLACK OF HIS NEW FOUND TOY THAT HE WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE VILLAGE OF NUMABO BUT INSISTED ON MAKING CAMP CLOSE BESIDE THE PLANE
NOW INDEED WOULD HE EXTERMINATE THIS PRESUMPTUOUS MAN THING
HE POINTED TOWARD A FRAGMENT THAT HAD EVIDENTLY FALLEN FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF AND WHICH NOW LAY IMBEDDED IN THE SAND A FEW FEET FROM THE BASE IT WAS A JAGGED FRAGMENT OF ROCK
BUT HE WILL ONLY THINK IT IS HIS WIFE HAD VON GOSS SUBSTITUTE THE BODY OF A DEAD NEGRESS AND CHAR IT AFTER PUTTING LADY GREYSTOKE'S RINGS ON IT LADY G WILL BE OF MORE VALUE TO THE HIGH COMMAND ALIVE THAN DEAD SHE LIVES CRIED TARZAN
NUMA SPRANG FOR THE NAKED CHEST OF THE APE MAN THROWING UP HIS LEFT ARM AS A BOXER MIGHT WARD OFF A BLOW TARZAN STRUCK UPWARD BENEATH THE LEFT FOREARM OF THE LION AT THE SAME TIME RUSHING IN WITH HIS SHOULDER BENEATH THE ANIMAL'S BODY
AND AFTER USANGA HAD CLAMBERED ABOARD THEY LIFTED HER UP AND HE REACHED DOWN AND DREW HER INTO THE FUSELAGE
YOU WILL HAVE TO GO ON WITHOUT ME NO SAID THE GIRL WE CANNOT DO THAT WE HAVE ALL BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH TOGETHER AND THE CHANCES OF OUR ESCAPE ARE STILL SO REMOTE THAT WHATEVER COMES LET US REMAIN TOGETHER UNLESS
DID NOT HAVE LONG TO WAIT BEFORE DISCOVERING SOMETHING OF USANGA'S PLAN FOR ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SERGEANT FINISHED GIVING HIS INSTRUCTIONS A NUMBER OF WARRIORS APPROACHED THE ENGLISHMAN WHILE THREE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE GIRL WITHOUT A WORD OF EXPLANATION
READY TO DEFEND HIMSELF IF NECESSARY BUT THERE WAS NONE THERE TO OPPOSE HIM DEAD AND DYING THEY LAY STREWN FOR FIFTY FEET ALONG THE TURF BY THE TIME TARZAN HAD FREED THE ENGLISHMAN THE GIRL JOINED THEM SHE TRIED TO VOICE HER THANKS TO THE APE MAN BUT HE SILENCED HER WITH A GESTURE
I'D LET THE BOUNDER TAKE IT UP AND BREAK HIS FOOL NECK AS HE WOULD DO INSIDE OF TWO MINUTES HOWEVER HE FINALLY PERSUADED USANGA TO BIDE HIS TIME FOR A FEW MORE DAYS OF INSTRUCTION BUT IN THE SUSPICIOUS MIND OF THE NEGRO THERE WAS A GROWING CONVICTION
AND SHE LOOKED UP AT TARZAN YOU WHO HAVE DONE SO MUCH FOR US TO WHOM YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATIONS WILL GO ON WITHOUT US
TELL HIM THIS AND TELL HIM THAT IF HE WILL SPARE YOU
FOR THE FRACTION OF AN INSTANT THAT WOULD PERMIT HIM TO REGAIN HIS FEET AND MEET THE ANIMAL AGAIN UPON A MORE EVEN FOOTING BUT THIS TIME NUMA WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM
HE SAW THE EYES OF THE NEGROES TURNED UPON HIM AND ONCE THEY FLASHED SIMULTANEOUSLY TOWARD THE WHITE GIRL EVERYTHING ABOUT THE OCCURRENCE WHICH IN ITSELF SEEMED TRIVIAL ENOUGH AROUSED IN THE MIND OF THE ENGLISHMAN A WELL DEFINED APPREHENSION THAT SOMETHING WAS AFOOT
THE TOMMIES THEIR PACKS AND ACCOUTERMENTS SLUNG WERE WAITING THE SUMMONS TO CONTINUE THEIR RETURN MARCH COLONEL CAPELL HAD THROUGH A DESIRE TO PERSONALLY OBSERVE THE STRETCH OF COUNTRY BETWEEN THE CAMP OF THE ADVANCE DETACHMENT AND THE BASE
I WANT HIM TO TEACH ME HOW TO FLY LIKE A BIRD REPLIED USANGA BERTHA KIRCHER LOOKED HER ASTONISHMENT BUT REPEATED THE DEMAND TO THE LIEUTENANT THE ENGLISHMAN MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HE WANTS TO LEARN TO FLY DOES HE HE REPEATED
BUT AT LEAST THEY COULD NOT BE ATTACKED UPON ALL SIDES AT ONCE THEY HAD SCARCELY CONCEALED THEMSELVES BEFORE TARZAN'S QUICK EARS CAUGHT A SOUND UPON THE FACE OF THE CLIFF ABOVE THEM AND LOOKING UP HE SAW A DIMINUTIVE MONKEY PERCHED UPON A SLIGHT PROJECTION
SMITH OLDWICK LIGHTED HIS CIGARETTE AND SAT PUFFING SLOWLY UPON IT HE HAD PROFFERED ONE TO THE GIRL BUT SHE HAD REFUSED AND THUS THEY SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME TIME THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT RUFFLED OCCASIONALLY BY THE FAINT CRUNCHING OF PADDED FEET UPON THE SOFT SANDS OF THE GORGE'S FLOOR
AND SIMULTANEOUSLY DROVE HIS BLADE INTO THE TAWNY HIDE BEHIND THE SHOULDER
HIS PRESENT MATE HE DID NOT KNOW THEN THAT USANGA HAD DETERMINED TO FLY AWAY WITH THE WHITE GIRL NEVER TO RETURN
IN PLACES IT WIDENED OUT AND AGAIN IT BECAME VERY NARROW AND ALWAYS DEEPER THE FURTHER SOUTH THEY TRAVELED PRESENTLY THE BOTTOM OF THE GORGE BEGAN TO SLOPE MORE RAPIDLY HERE AND THERE WERE INDICATIONS OF ANCIENT RAPIDS AND WATERFALLS
TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH AND THEN FROM WHERE SHE LAY SHE SAW A LION CHARGING FOR THE APE MAN BEFORE HER SHE SAW THE GIANT ARM SWING BACK WITH THE CURVED SABER AND SHE SAW IT FALL WITH TERRIFIC VELOCITY AND MEET THE LION AS HE ROSE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE MAN
WHAT IS IT ASKED THE GIRL
OF HER ALREADY ALMOST UNBEARABLE SITUATION FORGIVE ME HE SAID QUICKLY PLEASE FORGET WHAT THAT REMARK IMPLIED I PROMISE YOU THAT I WILL NOT OFFEND AGAIN IF IT DOES OFFEND YOU
AN UGLY FACED LITTLE MONKEY WHO LOOKED DOWN UPON THEM FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCAMPERED AWAY TOWARD THE SOUTH IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THEIR PURSUERS WERE COMING OTOBU HAD SEEN THE MONKEY TOO HE WILL TELL THE PARROTS SAID THE BLACK AND THE PARROTS WILL TELL THE MADMEN
THERE SHOULD BE NO REPETITION OF HIS HARROWING EXPERIENCE WITH NARATU THIS WIFE AND THE TWENTY FOUR OTHERS SHOULD BE CAREFULLY SELECTED AND WELL TRAINED HEREAFTER USANGA WOULD BE MASTER IN HIS OWN HOUSE BERTHA KIRCHER SAW THAT IT WAS USELESS TO APPEAL TO THE BRUTE
THAT BODED ILL FOR HIM AND FOR THE GIRL HE COULD NOT FREE HIMSELF OF THE IDEA AND SO HE KEPT A STILL CLOSER WATCH OVER THE BLACK ALTHOUGH AS HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT TO HIMSELF HE WAS QUITE POWERLESS TO AVERT ANY FATE THAT LAY IN STORE FOR THEM
IN ATTEMPTING TO SHIELD THE GIRL TARZAN RECEIVED ONE OF THE SHAFTS IN THE SHOULDER AND SO HEAVILY HAD THE WEAPON BEEN HURLED THAT IT BORE HIM BACKWARD TO THE GROUND SMITH OLDWICK FIRED HIS PISTOL TWICE WHEN HE TOO WAS STRUCK DOWN
TARZAN AND NUMA PASSED BETWEEN THEM BUT NEITHER THE GREAT BLACK MANED LION NOR THE MAN FAILED TO KEEP AN EYE UPON THE BEAST NEARER HIM SO THAT THEY WERE NOT CAUGHT UNAWARES WHEN AS THOUGH AT SOME PRECONCERTED SIGNAL
THAT MIGHT INDICATE THAT HIS SENTIMENTS TOWARD HER WERE MORE THAN THOSE OF A COMPANION IN DISTRESS SHE REGRETTED THAT HE HAD SPOKEN AS HE HAD AND HE TOO REGRETTED IT ALMOST INSTANTLY AS HE SAW THE SHADOW CROSS HER FACE AND REALIZED THAT HE HAD UNWITTINGLY ADDED TO THE DIFFICULTIES
THAT NONE OF THE OTHER THREE COULD DETECT THE SLIGHTEST BREAK IN THE UTTER AND DEATHLIKE QUIET OF THE GORGE FINALLY THE APE MAN RELAXED AND TURNED TOWARD THEM WHAT IS IT ASKED THE GIRL THEY ARE COMING HE REPLIED
FROM ANY HE HAD SEEN AS THOUGH THEY HAD SPRUNG ORIGINALLY FROM A CROSS BETWEEN THE FOREST LION OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND A BREED OF WHICH NUMA OF THE PIT MIGHT BE TYPICAL THE IMMEDIATE OBSTRUCTION IN HIS WAY HAVING BEEN REMOVED
SINCE THEY WERE EVIDENTLY NOT OF THE SAME RACE AS THE CREATURES WHICH LAY DEAD ABOUT THEM
HOWEVER AS ONE PLAN AFTER ANOTHER WAS CONJURED BY THE STRENGTH OF HIS DESIRES HE AT LAST HIT UPON ONE WHICH CAME TO HIM ALMOST WITH THE FORCE OF A BLOW AND BROUGHT HIM SITTING UPRIGHT AMONG HIS SLEEPING COMPANIONS
AND THE UNCOMPLAINING EFFORT SHE WAS MAKING TO PUSH ON THE ENGLISHMAN MUST HAVE NOTICED HER CONDITION TOO FOR SOME TIME AFTER NOON HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND SAT DOWN IN THE SAND IT'S NO USE HE SAID TO TARZAN I CAN GO NO FARTHER
HIS KNOWLEDGE OF USANGA TOGETHER WITH THE POSITION OF THE WHITE MAN TOLD HIM THAT THE BLACK SERGEANT WAS ATTEMPTING TO CARRY OFF THE WHITE GIRL WHY HE SHOULD BE DOING THIS WHEN HE HAD HER IN HIS POWER AND HAD ALSO CAPTURED AND SECURED THE ONLY CREATURE IN THE JUNGLE WHO MIGHT WISH TO DEFEND HER
THE FIRST INTIMATION USANGA HAD THAT ALL WAS NOT WELL WITH HIM WAS WHEN THE GIRL SLIPPED SUDDENLY TO HIS SIDE AND GRASPED THE CONTROL AND AT THE SAME INSTANT STEEL LIKE FINGERS SEIZED HIS THROAT A BROWN HAND SHOT DOWN WITH A KEEN BLADE AND SEVERED THE STRAP ABOUT HIS WAIST
INSTANTLY THE WEIGHT UPON THE ROPE WAS REMOVED AND A MOMENT LATER TARZAN OF THE APES RAISED HIS BODY ABOVE THE SIDE AND THREW A LEG OVER THE EDGE HE GLANCED FORWARD AT USANGA AND THEN PLACING HIS MOUTH CLOSE TO THE GIRL'S EAR HE CRIED HAVE YOU EVER PILOTED A PLANE
AS DID OTOBU'S AND THAT THEY WOULD TRAVEL TOGETHER AS FAR AS THE COUNTRY OF THE WAMABOS YOU ARE NOT GOING BACK WITH US THEN ASKED THE GIRL NO REPLIED THE APE MAN
SEEING THE FELLOW'S ACTIONS AND REALIZING INSTANTLY THE NATURAL ERROR THAT TARZAN'S YELLOW TUNIC HAD OCCASIONED THE GIRL SPRANG BETWEEN HIM AND THE SOLDIER DON'T SHOOT SHE CRIED TO THE LATTER WE ARE BOTH FRIENDS HOLD UP YOUR HANDS YOU THEN
THEN THE PLANE ROSE FROM THE GROUND AND IN A MOMENT SOARED GRACEFULLY IN A WIDE CIRCLE UNTIL IT TOPPED THE TREES THE BLACK SERGEANT WAS IN A VERITABLE COLLAPSE OF TERROR HE SAW THE EARTH DROPPING RAPIDLY FROM BENEATH HIM HE SAW THE TREES AND RIVER
THE TRAIL BECAME MORE DIFFICULT BUT WAS WELL MARKED AND SHOWED INDICATIONS OF GREAT ANTIQUITY AND IN PLACES THE HANDIWORK OF MAN
WHILE AROUND HIM STOOD A NUMBER OF THE BLACK DESERTERS FROM THE GERMAN COMMAND TARZAN HAD SEEN THESE MEN BEFORE AND KNEW WHO THEY WERE COMING TOWARD HIM DOWN THE MEADOW WAS AN AEROPLANE PILOTED BY THE BLACK USANGA AND IN THE SEAT BEHIND THE PILOT WAS THE WHITE GIRL BERTHA KIRCHER
HE SAW THE PLANE TILT AND THE MACHINE RISE FROM THE GROUND IT WAS A GOOD TAKE OFF AS GOOD AS LIEUTENANT HAROLD PERCY SMITH OLDWICK COULD MAKE HIMSELF BUT HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS ONLY SO BY CHANCE AT ANY INSTANT THE MACHINE MIGHT PLUNGE TO EARTH
AND MEN AND LIONS IN FRONT AND BEHIND
TARZAN WAS FOR SETTING OUT IN SEARCH OF THE SPOOR OF THE GIRL AND SMITH OLDWICK THAT HE MIGHT DISCOVER THEIR FATE HE SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF TREMENDOUSLY HUNGRY AND AS HE CIRCLED ABOUT OVER THE SANDY BOTTOM SEARCHING AMONG THE TANGLED NETWORK OF INNUMERABLE TRACKS
SMITH OLDWICK'S WOUNDS WERE DRESSED AS WELL AS WERE THOSE OF THE APE MAN AND IN HALF AN HOUR THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO THE CAMP OF THEIR RESCUERS
AT LAST THERE CAME TO THE EARS OF THE APE MAN A PECULIAR WHIRRING THROBBING SOUND FOR AN INSTANT HE PAUSED LISTENING INTENTLY AN AEROPLANE HE MUTTERED AND HASTENED FORWARD AT GREATLY INCREASED SPEED WHEN TARZAN OF THE APES FINALLY REACHED THE EDGE OF THE MEADOWLAND
BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF EITHER THE MAN OR THE WOMAN CROSSING THE CLEARING HE ENTERED THE BOMA AND THEN THE HUT BOTH WERE EMPTY AND HIS TRAINED NOSTRILS TOLD HIM THAT THEY HAD BEEN GONE FOR AT LEAST TWO DAYS AS HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE HUT
AND ESPECIALLY DO THESE BLACKS DISTRUST AN ENGLISHMAN WHOM THE GERMANS HAVE TAUGHT THEM TO BELIEVE ARE THE MOST TREACHEROUS AND DEGRADED OF PEOPLE NO IT IS BETTER THUS I AM SORRY THAT YOU CANNOT GO WITH US
NEVER HE SAID AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD TURNED AND WALKED AWAY
HAD NOT EVEN THE SATISFACTION OF STRIKING A BLOW IN SELF DEFENSE A VERITABLE AVALANCHE OF SAVAGE BEASTS ROLLED OVER HIM AND THREW HIM HEAVILY TO THE GROUND IN FALLING HIS HEAD STRUCK THE ROCKY SURFACE OF THE CLIFF STUNNING HIM
PROMISE HIM ANYTHING ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT I HAVE MONEY MORE MONEY THAN THAT POOR FOOL COULD IMAGINE THERE WAS IN THE WHOLE WORLD WITH IT HE CAN BUY ANYTHING THAT MONEY WILL PURCHASE FINE CLOTHES AND FOOD AND WOMEN ALL THE WOMEN HE WANTS
HE SPOKE IN ENGLISH WHICH OF COURSE NUMA DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING REASSURING IN THE TONE
FOR NOW THE LIONS WERE WHINING AS THOUGH THE FRESH SCENT SPOOR OF THEIR QUARRY HAD REACHED THEIR NOSTRILS I WISH THAT YOUR NUMA WOULD RETURN SAID THE GIRL YES SAID TARZAN BUT WE SHALL HAVE TO DO THE BEST WE CAN WITHOUT HIM
WHEN BERTHA KIRCHER HAD REPEATED USANGA'S PROPOSITION TO THE AVIATOR THE LATTER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WITH A WRY FACE FINALLY AGREED I FANCY THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT OF IT HE SAID IN ANY EVENT THE PLANE IS LOST TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
IN SO FAR AS THE BLACK COULD KNOW TARZAN COULD NOT GUESS
AT WHICH IT WOULD BE SAFE TO STOP AND TO SAY THUS FAR THE ENDS OF PUBLIC HAPPINESS WILL BE PROMOTED BY SUPPLYING THE WANTS OF GOVERNMENT AND ALL BEYOND THIS IS UNWORTHY OF OUR CARE OR ANXIETY
THE MORE INTELLIGENT ADVERSARIES OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION ADMIT THE FORCE OF THIS REASONING BUT THEY QUALIFY THEIR ADMISSION BY A DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT THEY CALL INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TAXATION THE FORMER
THE FEDERAL COUNCILS WILL DERIVE GREAT ADVANTAGE FROM ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH STATE WILL NOT ONLY BRING WITH THEM A CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS LAWS AND A LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS
AND ACTING UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES FAVORABLE TO DELIBERATION AND TO A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF ALL THE REASONS AND INDUCEMENTS WHICH WERE PROPER TO GOVERN THEIR CHOICE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS
THE PROCESS OF ELECTION AFFORDS A MORAL CERTAINTY THAT THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT WILL NEVER FALL TO THE LOT OF ANY MAN WHO IS NOT IN AN EMINENT DEGREE ENDOWED WITH THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS TALENTS FOR LOW INTRIGUE
WHICH CONSISTED OF TWENTY THREE CITIES OR REPUBLICS THE LARGEST WERE ENTITLED TO THREE VOTES IN THE COMMON COUNCIL THOSE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS TO TWO AND THE SMALLEST TO ONE THE COMMON COUNCIL HAD THE APPOINTMENT OF ALL THE JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES OF THE RESPECTIVE CITIES
THE NATURAL CONCLUSION IS THAT SUCH CONTESTS WILL BE MOST APT TO END TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE UNION AND THAT THERE IS GREATER PROBABILITY OF ENCROACHMENTS BY THE MEMBERS UPON THE FEDERAL HEAD THAN BY THE FEDERAL HEAD UPON THE MEMBERS
ALTHOUGH SUCH CONDUCT WOULD NOT BE WISE IT WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE NATURAL THE HISTORY OF THE STATES OF GREECE AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES ABOUNDS WITH SUCH INSTANCES AND IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT WHAT HAS SO OFTEN HAPPENED WOULD
NOT TO INVOLVE IN ITS DISCUSSION A VARIETY OF OBJECTS FOREIGN TO ITS MERITS AND OF VIEWS PASSIONS AND PREJUDICES LITTLE FAVORABLE TO THE DISCOVERY OF TRUTH
COMMERCE CONTRIBUTING TO BOTH THESE OBJECTS MUST OF NECESSITY RENDER THE PAYMENT OF TAXES EASIER AND FACILITATE THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES TO THE TREASURY THE HEREDITARY DOMINIONS OF THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY
OF COURSE IT CANNOT EXTEND TO THE APPOINTMENTS OF SENATORS WHOSE APPOINTMENTS ARE OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONSTITUTION
AND THAT OF THOSE MEN WHO HAVE OVERTURNED THE LIBERTIES OF REPUBLICS THE GREATEST NUMBER HAVE BEGUN THEIR CAREER BY PAYING AN OBSEQUIOUS COURT TO THE PEOPLE COMMENCING DEMAGOGUES AND ENDING TYRANTS
AS CONNECTED WITH THE SUBJECT OF REVENUE WE MAY WITH PROPRIETY CONSIDER THAT OF ECONOMY THE MONEY SAVED FROM ONE OBJECT MAY BE USEFULLY APPLIED TO ANOTHER
OF THIS NUMBER ONE NINTH ARE ELECTED BY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR PERSONS AND ONE HALF BY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PERSONS
IF ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOT CALLED FORTH ALL THE NATIONAL MEANS AND MATERIALS FOR FORMING FLEETS THEIR PROWESS AND THEIR THUNDER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED LET ENGLAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET
THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WILL AT ONCE SUGGEST TO US THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF THE EXECUTIVE MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE AND THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION TO REVERSE AND UNDO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY A PREDECESSOR
WOULD ENABLE US TO BARGAIN WITH GREAT ADVANTAGE FOR COMMERCIAL PRIVILEGES A PRICE WOULD BE SET NOT ONLY UPON OUR FRIENDSHIP BUT UPON OUR NEUTRALITY BY A STEADY ADHERENCE TO THE UNION WE MAY HOPE ERELONG
WHICH ARE REQUISITE IN ONE OF MUCH GREATER EXTENT THIS IDEA ADMITS NOT OF PRECISE DEMONSTRATION BECAUSE THERE IS NO RULE BY WHICH WE CAN MEASURE THE MOMENTUM OF CIVIL POWER NECESSARY
IF THE SAME ELECTORS AT THE SAME TIME ARE CAPABLE OF CHOOSING FOUR OR FIVE REPRESENTATIVES THEY CANNOT BE INCAPABLE OF CHOOSING ONE PENNSYLVANIA IS AN ADDITIONAL EXAMPLE SOME OF HER COUNTIES WHICH ELECT HER STATE REPRESENTATIVES
SO THE CHOICE WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO BE DIVERTED FROM HIM
IT HAS INDEED HAPPENED THAT GOVERNMENTS OF THIS KIND HAVE GENERALLY OPERATED IN THE MANNER WHICH THE DISTINCTION TAKEN NOTICE OF SUPPOSES TO BE INHERENT IN THEIR NATURE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN IN MOST OF THEM EXTENSIVE EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRACTICE WHICH SERVE TO PROVE
THE ATTEMPT THEREFORE TO REGULATE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE MEMBERS OF A CONFEDERACY BY ANY SUCH RULE CANNOT FAIL TO BE PRODUCTIVE OF GLARING INEQUALITY AND EXTREME OPPRESSION THIS INEQUALITY WOULD OF ITSELF
OF ESTABLISHING GOOD GOVERNMENT FROM REFLECTION AND CHOICE OR WHETHER THEY ARE FOREVER DESTINED TO DEPEND FOR THEIR POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONS ON ACCIDENT AND FORCE IF THERE BE ANY TRUTH IN THE REMARK
UNASSISTED BY ANY ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS OR ILLUSTRATIONS BUT WE FIND IN FACT THAT THE ANTAGONISTS OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION SO FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN THEIR JUSTNESS OR TRUTH
FOR THE MEANS OF REVENUE CHIEFLY ON SUCH DUTIES IN MOST PARTS OF IT EXCISES MUST BE CONFINED WITHIN A NARROW COMPASS THE GENIUS OF THE PEOPLE WILL ILL BROOK THE INQUISITIVE AND PEREMPTORY SPIRIT OF EXCISE LAWS
SUCH AN INFATUATED POLICY SUCH A DESPERATE EXPEDIENT MIGHT BY THE MULTIPLICATION OF PETTY OFFICES ANSWER THE VIEWS OF MEN WHO POSSESS NOT QUALIFICATIONS TO EXTEND THEIR INFLUENCE BEYOND THE NARROW CIRCLES OF PERSONAL INTRIGUE
IF OPPOSITION TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ARISE FROM THE DISORDERLY CONDUCT OF REFRACTORY OR SEDITIOUS INDIVIDUALS IT COULD BE OVERCOME BY THE SAME MEANS WHICH ARE DAILY EMPLOYED AGAINST THE SAME EVIL UNDER THE STATE GOVERNMENTS
AND THAT WHENEVER SUCH INDUCEMENTS MAY FIND FIT TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OPERATION PRETENSES TO COLOR AND JUSTIFY THEM WILL NOT BE WANTING WISELY THEREFORE DO THEY CONSIDER UNION AND A GOOD NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
THE LATTER MAY SOMETIMES STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THE FORMER AND AT OTHER TIMES THE PEOPLE MAY BE ENTIRELY NEUTRAL IN EITHER SUPPOSITION IT IS CERTAINLY DESIRABLE THAT THE EXECUTIVE SHOULD BE IN A SITUATION TO DARE TO ACT HIS OWN OPINION WITH VIGOR AND DECISION
WHICH HAVE BEEN CONTRIVED TO PERVERT THE PUBLIC OPINION IN RELATION TO THE SUBJECT THEY SO FAR EXCEED THE USUAL THOUGH UNJUSTIFIABLE LICENSES OF PARTY ARTIFICE
ALL THE ANCIENT ESTABLISHMENTS AS WELL IN THE CHURCH AS STATE IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE ON A RECENT OCCASION TO MAKE THE MONARCH TREMBLE AT THE PROSPECT
THE SAME RULE WHICH TEACHES THE PROPRIETY OF A PARTITION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF POWER TEACHES US LIKEWISE THAT THIS PARTITION OUGHT TO BE SO CONTRIVED AS TO RENDER THE ONE INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER
THAT THE REAL DISADVANTAGES TO BRITAIN FROM SUCH A STATE OF THINGS CONSPIRING WITH THE PRE POSSESSIONS OF A GREAT PART OF THE NATION IN FAVOR OF THE AMERICAN TRADE AND WITH THE IMPORTUNITIES OF THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS
THAT IT CAN BE ADMITTED TO HAVE ANY PRETENSIONS TO FAIRNESS THE MOMENT WE LAUNCH INTO CONJECTURES ABOUT THE USURPATIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE GET INTO AN UNFATHOMABLE ABYSS AND FAIRLY PUT OURSELVES OUT OF THE REACH OF ALL REASONING
BY A MULTIPLICITY OF CAUSES WHICH IN THE COURSE OF THESE PAPERS HAVE BEEN AMPLY DETAILED A UNITY OF COMMERCIAL AS WELL AS POLITICAL INTERESTS CAN ONLY RESULT FROM A UNITY OF GOVERNMENT
IT MAY THEREFORE BE SATISFACTORY TO ANALYZE THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH THEY COMBAT IT THOSE OF THEM WHICH HAVE BEEN MOST LABORED WITH THAT VIEW SEEM IN SUBSTANCE TO AMOUNT TO THIS IT IS NOT TRUE
THEY AT THE SAME TIME ADMONISH US TO LAMENT THAT THE VICES OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD PERVERT THE DIRECTION AND TARNISH THE LUSTRE OF THOSE BRIGHT TALENTS AND EXALTED ENDOWMENTS FOR WHICH THE FAVORED SOILS THAT PRODUCED THEM HAVE BEEN SO JUSTLY CELEBRATED
AND WHEN THE PROGRESS OF HOSTILITY AND DESOLATION LEFT LITTLE ROOM FOR THOSE CALM AND MATURE INQUIRIES AND REFLECTIONS WHICH MUST EVER PRECEDE THE FORMATION OF A WISE AND WELL BALANCED GOVERNMENT FOR A FREE PEOPLE
IN THEIR TRUE SIGNIFICATION ARE TOO LITTLE IN UNISON WITH THE FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE TO ADMIT OF GREAT USE BEING MADE OF THAT MODE OF TAXATION NOR INDEED IN THE STATES WHERE ALMOST THE SOLE EMPLOYMENT IS AGRICULTURE
FOR THE PROPITIOUS CONCORD WHICH HAS DISTINGUISHED THE CONSULTATIONS FOR OUR POLITICAL HAPPINESS A DESIGN WAS ALSO CONCEIVED OF ESTABLISHING A GENERAL TAX TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY
WHICH WOULD GIVE UNLIMITED SCOPE TO ALL NATIONS TO BE THE CARRIERS AS WELL AS THE PURCHASERS OF THEIR COMMODITIES PENNSYLVANIA MAY NOT CHOOSE TO CONFOUND HER INTERESTS IN A CONNECTION SO ADVERSE TO HER POLICY
WITHOUT MUCH AGGREGATE BENEFIT TO THE STATE
THESE AND SIMILAR CONSIDERATIONS THEN INDUCED THE PEOPLE TO RELY GREATLY ON THE JUDGMENT AND INTEGRITY OF THE CONGRESS AND THEY TOOK THEIR ADVICE NOTWITHSTANDING THE VARIOUS ARTS AND ENDEAVORS USED TO DETER THEM FROM IT
WHICH WE USED TO PURCHASE FROM THEM THE EXTENSION OF OUR OWN COMMERCE IN OUR OWN VESSELS CANNOT GIVE PLEASURE TO ANY NATIONS WHO POSSESS TERRITORIES ON OR NEAR THIS CONTINENT
IS THE CONSEQUENCE FROM THIS DOCTRINE ADMISSIBLE IF WE SAY THAT FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED CITIZENS ARE AS MANY AS CAN JOINTLY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE MUST WE NOT DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE OF THE IMMEDIATE CHOICE OF THEIR PUBLIC SERVANTS
THAT THIS STATE OF THINGS MUST REST ON THE BASIS OF A GENERAL UNION AS FAR AS THIS WOULD BE CONDUCIVE TO THE INTERESTS OF COMMERCE SO FAR IT MUST TEND TO THE EXTENSION OF THE REVENUE TO BE DRAWN FROM THAT SOURCE
AND TO PLACE IT IN A CLEAR AND STRONG LIGHT AS AN UNEQUIVOCAL PROOF OF THE UNWARRANTABLE ARTS WHICH ARE PRACTICED TO PREVENT A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JUDGMENT OF THE REAL MERITS OF THE CONSTITUTION SUBMITTED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE PEOPLE
AND OF A PEACE ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE UNION THUS CIRCUMSTANCED A WAR BREAKS OUT WHAT WOULD BE THE PROBABLE CONDUCT OF THE GOVERNMENT IN SUCH AN EMERGENCY TAUGHT BY EXPERIENCE THAT PROPER DEPENDENCE COULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE SUCCESS OF REQUISITIONS
AS FAR AS IT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO RENDERING REGULATIONS FOR THE COLLECTION OF THE DUTIES MORE SIMPLE AND EFFICACIOUS SO FAR IT MUST SERVE TO ANSWER THE PURPOSES OF MAKING THE SAME RATE OF DUTIES MORE PRODUCTIVE
THESE MOST DEADLY ADVERSARIES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MAKE THEIR APPROACHES FROM MORE THAN ONE QUARTER BUT CHIEFLY FROM THE DESIRE IN FOREIGN POWERS TO GAIN AN IMPROPER ASCENDANT IN OUR COUNCILS
AND THAT WHENEVER THEY HAPPEN THE ONLY CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDY IS FORCE AND THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THE USE OF IT CIVIL WAR IT REMAINS TO INQUIRE HOW FAR SO ODIOUS AN ENGINE OF GOVERNMENT IN ITS APPLICATION TO US
THE RELATIVE SITUATION OF THESE STATES THE NUMBER OF RIVERS WITH WHICH THEY ARE INTERSECTED AND OF BAYS THAT WASH THERE SHORES THE FACILITY OF COMMUNICATION IN EVERY DIRECTION THE AFFINITY OF LANGUAGE AND MANNERS
IT WERE IRRATIONAL TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE DISINCLINED TO ITS SUPPORT IF ON THE CONTRARY THE INSURRECTION SHOULD PERVADE A WHOLE STATE OR A PRINCIPAL PART OF IT THE EMPLOYMENT OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF FORCE MIGHT BECOME UNAVOIDABLE
WITH A VIEW TO GETTING RID OF ALL EXTERNAL CONTROL UPON THEIR DESIGNS OF PERSONAL AGGRANDIZEMENT THE BETTER TO EFFECT WHICH IT IS PRESUMABLE THEY WOULD TAMPER BEFOREHAND WITH LEADING INDIVIDUALS IN THE ADJACENT STATES IF ASSOCIATES COULD NOT BE FOUND AT HOME
CONSPIRE TO ELUCIDATE THE SENSE OF THE PROVISION WHICH IF IT HAD BEEN INTENDED TO COMPREHEND SENATORS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE REFERRED THE TEMPORARY POWER OF FILLING VACANCIES TO THE RECESS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURES
FOR ALL THOSE MATTERS WHICH WILL CALL FOR DISBURSEMENTS OUT OF THE NATIONAL TREASURY THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE MUST BE INTERWOVEN IN THE FRAME OF THE GOVERNMENT A GENERAL POWER OF TAXATION IN ONE SHAPE OR ANOTHER MONEY IS WITH PROPRIETY
TO JUDGE FROM THE CONDUCT OF THE OPPOSITE PARTIES WE SHALL BE LED TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY WILL MUTUALLY HOPE TO EVINCE THE JUSTNESS OF THEIR OPINIONS AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THEIR CONVERTS BY THE LOUDNESS OF THEIR DECLAMATIONS AND THE BITTERNESS OF THEIR INVECTIVES
MUST HAVE ORIGINATED IN AN INTENTION TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE TOO PALPABLE TO BE OBSCURED BY SOPHISTRY TOO ATROCIOUS TO BE PALLIATED BY HYPOCRISY I HAVE TAKEN THE PAINS TO SELECT THIS INSTANCE OF MISREPRESENTATION
BUT A REGARD TO THE PUBLIC GOOD AND TO THE SENSE OF THE PEOPLE AS THE DUTIES OF SUPERINTENDING THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND OF SECURING THE PUBLIC PEACE AGAINST FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INVOLVE A PROVISION FOR CASUALTIES AND DANGERS
TO THE PUBLIC GOOD WE SHALL SEE NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT THE LIKE PORTION OF POWER WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO PERFORM THE SAME TASK IN A SOCIETY FAR MORE NUMEROUS CIVIL POWER PROPERLY ORGANIZED AND EXERTED
THE NATURAL CURE FOR AN ILL ADMINISTRATION IN A POPULAR OR REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION IS A CHANGE OF MEN A GUARANTY BY THE NATIONAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE AS MUCH LEVELLED AGAINST THE USURPATIONS OF RULERS AS AGAINST THE FERMENTS AND OUTRAGES OF FACTION AND SEDITION IN THE COMMUNITY
AND THESE CAUSES TOGETHER COULD NOT FAIL TO OCCASION A DISGRACEFUL AND RUINOUS MUTABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH A POSITIVE DURATION OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT I CONNECT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF RE ELIGIBILITY
OF HALF THAT ANNUAL VALUE TO THIS QUALIFICATION ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES IS ADDED ANOTHER ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY ELECTORS WHICH RESTRAINS THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE TO PERSONS HAVING A FREEHOLD ESTATE OF THE ANNUAL VALUE
EXPERIENCE ON A FORMER OCCASION TEACHES US NOT TO BE TOO SANGUINE IN SUCH HOPES IT IS NOT YET FORGOTTEN THAT WELL GROUNDED APPREHENSIONS OF IMMINENT DANGER INDUCED THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA TO FORM THE MEMORABLE CONGRESS OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
BUT THE UNIVERSAL AND EXTREME INDIGNATION WHICH IT INSPIRES IS ITSELF A PROOF OF THE ENERGY AND PREVALENCE OF THE CONTRARY SENTIMENT IN THE THIRD PLACE THOSE TIES WHICH BIND THE REPRESENTATIVE TO HIS CONSTITUENTS
THIS BOLD EXPERIMENT UPON THE DISCERNMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN HAS BEEN HAZARDED BY A WRITER WHO WHATEVER MAY BE HIS REAL MERIT HAS HAD NO INCONSIDERABLE SHARE IN THE APPLAUSES OF HIS PARTY
OF THE PROPOSED GOVERNMENT WHETHER LANGUAGE CAN FURNISH EPITHETS OF TOO MUCH ASPERITY FOR SO SHAMELESS AND SO PROSTITUTE AN ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE ON THE CITIZENS OF AMERICA
AN AVARICIOUS MAN WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO FILL THE OFFICE LOOKING FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN HE MUST AT ALL EVENTS YIELD UP THE EMOLUMENTS HE ENJOYED WOULD FEEL A PROPENSITY NOT EASY TO BE RESISTED BY SUCH A MAN
UNABLE BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY TO LAY HOLD OF FRESH RESOURCES AND URGED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF NATIONAL DANGER WOULD IT NOT BE DRIVEN TO THE EXPEDIENT OF DIVERTING THE FUNDS ALREADY APPROPRIATED FROM THEIR PROPER OBJECTS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE STATE
AND HAVE MOST LIBERALLY RECEIVED THE APPLAUDING SUFFRAGES OF POLITICAL WRITERS THIS EXCEPTIONABLE PRINCIPLE MAY AS TRULY AS EMPHATICALLY BE STYLED THE PARENT OF ANARCHY
THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL SATURDAY FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MADISON TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE THIRD THE TIME WITHIN WHICH THE POWER IS TO OPERATE DURING THE RECESS OF THE SENATE AND THE DURATION OF THE APPOINTMENTS TO THE END OF THE NEXT SESSION OF THAT BODY
WHICH PRESENTS TO MANKIND SO MANY POLITICAL LESSONS BOTH OF THE MONITORY AND EXEMPLARY KIND AND WHICH HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY CONSULTED IN THE COURSE OF THESE INQUIRIES CORROBORATES THE RESULT OF THE REFLECTIONS WHICH WE HAVE JUST MADE
ENJOYING THE SAME NATIONAL RIGHTS PRIVILEGES AND PROTECTION AS A NATION WE HAVE MADE PEACE AND WAR AS A NATION WE HAVE VANQUISHED OUR COMMON ENEMIES AS A NATION WE HAVE FORMED ALLIANCES
THAN THE ALTERNATIVE OF AN ADOPTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION OR A DISMEMBERMENT OF THE UNION IT WILL THEREFORE BE OF USE TO BEGIN BY EXAMINING THE ADVANTAGES OF THAT UNION
ARE APT TO OPERATE AS WELL UPON THOSE WHO SUPPORT AS THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE RIGHT SIDE OF A QUESTION WERE THERE NOT EVEN THESE INDUCEMENTS TO MODERATION NOTHING COULD BE MORE ILL JUDGED THAN THAT INTOLERANT SPIRIT WHICH HAS AT ALL TIMES
AND BY WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO UNDERSELL THOSE NATIONS IN THEIR OWN MARKETS WHAT MORE NATURAL THAN THAT THEY SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO EXCLUDE FROM THE LISTS SUCH DANGEROUS COMPETITORS THIS BRANCH OF TRADE
AND THE MOMENT THE PART WHICH HAD BEEN REDUCED TO SUBMISSION WAS LEFT TO ITSELF ITS EFFORTS WOULD BE RENEWED AND ITS RESISTANCE REVIVE WE SHOULD RECOLLECT
THAN CONSISTS WITH THE WISHES OR POLICY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SOVEREIGNS SPAIN THINKS IT CONVENIENT TO SHUT THE MISSISSIPPI AGAINST US ON THE ONE SIDE AND BRITAIN EXCLUDES US FROM THE SAINT LAWRENCE ON THE OTHER
THAT THE EXTENT OF THE MILITARY FORCE MUST AT ALL EVENTS BE REGULATED BY THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME TO COME IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN A LARGE ARMY
THAT THEY SO SELDOM ERR AS THEY DO BESET AS THEY CONTINUALLY ARE BY THE WILES OF PARASITES AND SYCOPHANTS BY THE SNARES OF THE AMBITIOUS THE AVARICIOUS THE DESPERATE BY THE ARTIFICES
AS REVENUE IS THE ESSENTIAL ENGINE BY WHICH THE MEANS OF ANSWERING THE NATIONAL EXIGENCIES MUST BE PROCURED THE POWER OF PROCURING THAT ARTICLE IN ITS FULL EXTENT MUST NECESSARILY BE COMPREHENDED IN THAT OF PROVIDING FOR THOSE EXIGENCIES
IF THE NORTHERN CONFEDERACY INCLUDES NEW JERSEY THERE IS NO LIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN ONE CONFEDERACY TO THE SOUTH OF THAT STATE NOTHING CAN BE MORE EVIDENT THAN THAT
TILL THEY ARRIVE TO SUCH A DEGREE OF POWER AS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED BODY A REPUBLIC OF THIS KIND ABLE TO WITHSTAND AN EXTERNAL FORCE MAY SUPPORT ITSELF WITHOUT ANY INTERNAL CORRUPTIONS
MIGHT AT A SMALL EXPENSE BE MADE USEFUL SENTINELS OF THE LAWS AND THE GOVERNMENT HAVING THE SAME INTEREST TO PROVIDE AGAINST VIOLATIONS EVERYWHERE THE CO OPERATION OF ITS
STANDING BY THE PARAPET OF THE WALL WITH HER FACE SET TOWARD THE WESTWARD VIEW HE APPROACHED CAUTIOUSLY TO MAKE SURE OF HER BEFORE SHE TURNED AND OBSERVED HIM THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THAT TALL DARK FIGURE AS IT RESTED AGAINST THE PARAPET WITH A LISTLESS GRACE
UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IS YOUR WAY MISTER HUXTABLE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO BEGIN WITH OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR TO NIGHT SAID MAGDALEN
SYMPATHY AND ADMIRATION MAY OR MAY NOT BE STRONG WITHIN ME WHEN I CONTEMPLATE THE DASH AND INDEPENDENCE OF YOUR CHARACTER HOSTS OF EXAMPLES OF BRIGHT STARS OF THE BRITISH DRAMA
SHALL RECEIVE THE ABOVE REWARD APPLY AT THE OFFICE OF MISTER HARKNESS SOLICITOR CONEY STREET YORK OR TO MESSRS WYATT PENDRIL AND GWILT SERLE STREET LINCOLN'S INN LONDON
TO LOSE NO TIME IN EMPTYING HIS GLASS IN A FEW MINUTES HE SENT THE NECESSARY MESSAGE UPSTAIRS WHILE WAITING FOR MAGDALEN'S APPEARANCE HE PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH CERTAIN MATERIALS WHICH WERE NOW NECESSARY TO CARRY THE ENTERPRISE TO ITS CROWNING POINT
ADDRESSED TO AN AUDIENCE WHICH INCLUDED A FATHER OF MISTER VANSTONE'S DISPOSITION AND A DAUGHTER OF MAGDALEN'S TEMPERAMENT PRODUCED THE RESULT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED FROM THE FIRST
TAKING LEAVE OF MISTER VANSTONE AT THE HALL DOOR I'M TO COME TO MORROW AND HEAR MORE OF HER VIEWS IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION I SHALL NEVER DO IT DON'T TELL HER I SAID SO
THE COACH APPEARED AT LAST AND DREW UP AT SEA VIEW IN A MINUTE MORE CAPTAIN WRAGGE'S OWN OBSERVATION INFORMED HIM THAT ONE AMONG THE PASSENGERS WHO LEFT ALDBOROUGH THAT MORNING WAS MISSUS LECOUNT
THE CAPTAIN PAUSED WEIGHED THE RELATIVE CLAIMS ON HIS ATTENTION OF THE QUIET LOCALITY AND THE PASTRY COOK'S SHOP
ENTERED THE BOAT ALSO AND EMPLOYED THE SHORT INTERVAL OF TRANSIT TO THE OPPOSITE BANK IN A PERUSAL OF THE HANDBILL
PROVIDED NOTHING BUT A NECESSARY LINE WAS ADDED TO THE ADDRESS PROVIDED NOBODY TOUCHED THE LETTER
THE MURMUR OF THE SUMMER WAVES ON THE SHINGLE OF THE BEACH AND THE VOICES OF THE SUMMER IDLERS ON THE PARADE FLOATED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW AND FILLED THE EMPTY STILLNESS OF THE ROOM SHE RAISED HER HEAD
YOU SEE YOUR WAY MAGDALEN HANG ME IF I CAN SEE MINE SHE SKIRTED A LITTLE NEARER
HE STOOD ON THIS SPOT AND SEARCHED FOR HER AGAIN AND SEARCHED IN VAIN OTHERS WERE LOOKING IDLY DOWN AT THE DESOLATE ACTIVITY ON THE WILDERNESS OF THE IRON RAILS BUT SHE WAS NOT AMONG THEM THE CAPTAIN GLANCED DOUBTFULLY AT THE DARKENING SKY
SHE SMILED WHEN SHE WAS OUTSIDE ON THE LANDING THE FEMALE MIND DOES OCCASIONALLY THOUGH NOT OFTEN PROJECT ITSELF INTO THE FUTURE MISS GARTH WAS PROPHETICALLY PITYING MAGDALEN'S UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND
TURNED IT SUDDENLY AS IF SHE WAS IN PAIN ARE YOU NOT WELL MAMMA ASKED MAGDALEN QUITE WELL MY LOVE
AND BROUGHT WITH HER THE DRAMATIC QUALIFICATION OF HABITUALLY WEARING A WIG IN PRIVATE LIFE THANKS TO THESE VIGOROUS MEASURES THE PLAY WAS AT LAST SUPPLIED WITH REPRESENTATIVES
MY DEAR HE HAS NO PROSPECTS IN ENGLAND I WISH HE HAD FOR HIS OWN SAKE I WISH THE LAD WELL WITH ALL MY HEART
AND TO THE DOUBTFUL PROSPECT THAT AWAITED HER IN THE COMING SUMMER IN A TONE OF DESPONDENCY WHICH IT WAS VERY DISTRESSING TO HEAR ANXIOUS TO CHEER HER SPIRITS MISS GARTH HAD CHANGED THE CONVERSATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
YOU RATHER STAGGER ME WELL I DON'T KNOW YES I SUPPOSE I MUST LET YOU BE MARRIED ONE OF THESE DAYS IF WE CAN FIND A GOOD HUSBAND FOR YOU HOW HOT YOUR FACE IS
OF A WOMAN OF TWICE HER AGE SHE LITERALLY FORCED HIM INTO HIS PART HER FATHER FELL ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR MISSUS VANSTONE AND MISS GARTH LOST THEIR INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS
AT LAST HER GROWING ANXIETY URGED HER TO FOLLOW HIM INTO THE HOUSE A NEW TIMIDITY THROBBED IN HER HEART AS SHE DOUBTINGLY APPROACHED THE DOOR NEVER HAD SHE SEEN THE DEPTHS OF HER FATHER'S SIMPLE NATURE STIRRED AS THEY HAD BEEN STIRRED BY HER CONFESSION
THERE WAS NO CHOICE ON A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH BUT TO SAVE THE PRECIOUS HOURS BY WRITING TO HIM AFTER SENDING TO SECURE A PLACE AT ONCE IN THE EARLY COACH SHE SAT DOWN TO WRITE TO HER MASTER
AND TO THE UNIVERSE FOR A FALKLAND WITH THE MENDICANT PERTINACITY OF A FAMILY IN DESPAIR THIS STATEMENT OF CIRCUMSTANCES
THE HANDBILL REVEALED PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT THE MAN'S NEXT OBJECT WAS TO COMPLETE THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE LOCAL SOLICITOR ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PROMISED REWARD HAVING SEEN AND HEARD ENOUGH FOR HIS IMMEDIATE PURPOSE THE CAPTAIN RETRACED HIS STEPS DOWN THE STREET TURNED TO THE RIGHT
I SHALL LIMIT THE SUM MY DEAR
STOP ON YOUR PERCH IF YOU LIKE IT
THE SPOILED DARLING OF HER PARENTS THE PRICELESS TREASURE OF THE HOUSEHOLD NEVER LEFT UNPROTECTED NEVER TRUSTED ALONE THERE SHE STOOD IN THE LOVELY DAWN OF HER WOMANHOOD A CASTAWAY IN A STRANGE CITY WRECKED ON THE WORLD
IN SPITE OF WANT OF SOCIETY AND HASTY BREAKFASTS AND BAD DINNERS AT CHOP HOUSES HIS ATTENDANCE AT THE OFFICE WAS REGULAR AND HIS DILIGENCE AT THE DESK UNREMITTING THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT IN WHICH HE WAS WORKING
WHAT IS TO HINDER YOUR FACILITATING THE POST OFFICE WORK AND OBLIGING A LADY
DRIVING ABOUT IN A CAB POSSIBLE CERTAINLY BUT NO MORE LOITERING AWAY THE TIME IN SOME QUIET LOCALITY OUT OF DOORS LIKELY ENOUGH AGAIN ON THAT FINE AUTUMN EVENING
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME LOOKED HIM CLOSE IN THE FACE HE SUSTAINED HER SUSPICIOUS SCRUTINY WITH EVERY APPEARANCE OF FEELING HIGHLY GRATIFIED BY IT H U X HUX SAID THE CAPTAIN PLAYFULLY TURNING TO THE OLD JOKE
REJECTED ACCORDINGLY THE SECOND COURSE WAS TO DESERVE THE GRATITUDE OF THE YOUNG LADY'S FRIENDS RATED AT FIFTY POUNDS THE THIRD COURSE WAS BY A TIMELY WARNING TO DESERVE THE GRATITUDE OF THE YOUNG LADY HERSELF RATED AT AN UNKNOWN FIGURE
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE THINKING OF ANDREW WHEN YOU GAVE YOUR CONSENT
DON'T FOR MINE HER FATHER'S KIND FACE SADDENED HE SIGHED AND PATTED HER FAIR HEAD TENDERLY HUSH MY LOVE HE SAID ALMOST IN A WHISPER HUSH
THE GIRL'S FERVID TEMPERAMENT INTENSIFIED THE ESSENTIALLY FEMININE PLEASURE THAT MOST WOMEN FEEL IN THE PASSAGE OF THE COMB THROUGH THEIR HAIR TO A LUXURY OF SENSATION WHICH ABSORBED HER IN ENJOYMENT
GO MISTER VANSTONE BASKING IN GOLDEN VISIONS OF HIS YOUNG FRIEND'S FUTURE ECHOED THAT MONOSYLLABIC DECISION WITH ALL HIS HEART MISSUS VANSTONE MISS GARTH EVEN NORAH HERSELF SPOKE TO THE SAME PURPOSE
ONE OF TWO THINGS THOUGHT WRAGGE TO HIMSELF IN HIS LOGICAL WAY SHE'S WORTH MORE THAN FIFTY POUNDS TO ME IN HER PRESENT SITUATION OR SHE ISN'T IF SHE IS HER FRIENDS MAY WHISTLE FOR HER
THOSE WORDS DECIDED THE ONLY DOUBT WHICH NOW REMAINED IN THE CAPTAIN'S MIND THE DOUBT WHETHER THE COURSE WAS CLEAR BEFORE HIM THE MOTIVE OF HER FLIGHT FROM HOME WAS EVIDENTLY WHAT THE HANDBILLS ASSUMED IT TO BE A RECKLESS FANCY FOR GOING ON THE STAGE
ANOTHER OUTBREAK MIGHT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED
SAID THE CAPTAIN TICKING OFF THE LETTERS PERSUASIVELY ON HIS FINGERS I REMEMBER YOUR NAME SAID MAGDALEN EXCUSE ME FOR LEAVING YOU ABRUPTLY I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT SHE TRIED TO PASS HIM AND WALK ON NORTHWARD TOWARD THE RAILWAY
ANYTHING TO PLEASE YOU MY DEAR YES I PROMISE
MISTER VANSTONE'S EYES OPENED WIDER AND WIDER
WHAT IS TO PREVENT MY SENDING THE TICKET FOR IT NOTHING IF YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE YOUR ADDRESS BY MEANS OF YOUR BOX NOTHING WHATEVER THINK PRAY THINK
WHICH A WOMAN CAN BESTOW ON A MAN IN PLAINER WORDS SHE HAD JUST GIVEN FRANK A KISS IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH AN EMERGENCY AS NOW CONFRONTED HER
IT WAS PLAINLY EVIDENT THAT HE HAD NO PARTICULAR DESTINATION TO REACH AND NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WHILE HE WAS STILL LOITERING THE CLOCK OF YORK MINSTER CHIMED THE HALF HOUR PAST FIVE CABS RATTLED BY HIM OVER THE BRIDGE ON THEIR WAY TO MEET THE TRAIN FROM LONDON
WHILE I WALK OVER TO THE COTTAGE HE STOPPED
WHEN FRANK PRESENTED HIMSELF IN THE EVENING IGNORANT OF THE FIRST ELEMENTS OF HIS PART SHE TOOK HIM IN HAND AS A MIDDLE AGED SCHOOLMISTRESS MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IN HAND A BACKWARD LITTLE BOY
DON'T LET HIM GO DON'T DON'T YOU WILL BREAK HIS HEART HE IS AFRAID TO TELL HIS FATHER HE IS EVEN AFRAID YOU MIGHT BE ANGRY WITH HIM THERE IS NOBODY TO SPEAK FOR US EXCEPT EXCEPT ME OH DON'T LET HIM GO DON'T FOR HIS SAKE SHE WHISPERED THE NEXT WORDS
THAT THERE WAS AN UNACCOUNTABLE APPEARANCE OF RESTRAINT IN MISSUS VANSTONE'S FIRST RECEPTION OF HER WAS ANTICIPATED ARIGHT AFTER A LITTLE THE MOTHER'S QUESTIONS CAME MORE AND MORE UNRESERVEDLY FROM THE SWEET
HARUM SCARUM HEAD OF YOURS NOW I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW PAPA WILL YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION I WILL IF I CAN MY DEAR
HIS FATHER STOPPED HIM AT THE FIRST WORD POINTED PEREMPTORILY SOUTHEASTWARD
ALL BE SERIOUS ENOUGH IF YOU HAD MY RESPONSIBILITIES NO PAPA NO WINE TO DAY THANK YOU I MUST KEEP MY INTELLIGENCE CLEAR WATER THOMAS AND A LITTLE MORE JELLY I THINK BEFORE YOU TAKE IT AWAY
AS SOON AS HE COULD SPEAK COMPOSEDLY ARE YOU SURE SHE ANSWERED THE QUESTION BEFORE HE COULD FINISH IT SURE I LOVE HIM SHE SAID OH WHAT WORDS CAN SAY YES FOR ME AS I WANT TO SAY IT I LOVE HIM HER VOICE FALTERED SOFTLY
TIME CHANGE AND POVERTY HAD ALL ATTACKED THE CAPTAIN TOGETHER AND HAD ALL FAILED ALIKE TO GET HIM DOWN ON THE GROUND HE PACED THE STREETS OF YORK A MAN SUPERIOR TO CLOTHES AND CIRCUMSTANCES HIS VAGABOND VARNISH AS BRIGHT ON HIM AS EVER
OUT OF HIS POCKET AND APPROACHING HER CLOSELY FOR THE FIRST TIME LAID HIS HAND ON HER ARM ROUSE YOURSELF HE SAID I HAVE A LAST WORD TO SAY TO YOU CAN YOU LISTEN SHE STRUGGLED AND ROUSED HERSELF
I SUSPECTED THIS FROM THE FIRST BUT I HAD NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT MY SUSPICIONS I HAD NO MEANS OF COMBATING THE FALSE IMPRESSION PRODUCED ON YOU MY HANDS I THANK HEAVEN ARE TIED NO LONGER
AND ALL EQUALLY DEPRIVED OF THE MEANS OF INFORMATION A SUDDEN PARTING OF THE CROWD NEAR THE SECOND CLASS CARRIAGES ATTRACTED THE CAPTAIN'S CURIOSITY HE PUSHED HIS WAY IN AND FOUND A DECENTLY DRESSED MAN ASSISTED BY A PORTER AND A POLICEMAN
NO TENDER CONSIDERATION HAD PREPARED HER FOR THE SHOCK NO KIND WORD SOFTENED IT TO HER WHEN IT CAME THE VAGABOND WHOSE CUNNING EYES WATCHED HER EAGERLY WHILE SHE READ
AS HE CRUMPLED UP THE BILL IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND HIS PARTY COLORED EYES FIXED WITH HUNGRY INTEREST ON THE PROPRIETOR OF THE UNLUCKY PARCEL WHEN A MAN HAPPENS NOT TO BE POSSESSED OF FIFTY PENCE IN HIS OWN POCKET IF HIS HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE IT BOUNDS
MY WILL MADE LONG BEFORE I EVER THOUGHT OF HAVING A SON IN LAW DIVIDES MY FORTUNE INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS
I WILL ENGAGE TO LEAVE YOUR SERVICE AT A DAY'S NOTICE AND I WILL ATONE FOR THE SIN OF BEARING FALSE WITNESS AGAINST MY NEIGHBOR BY RESIGNING
THE GREAT FIRM IN THE CITY HAD OBVIOUSLY MADE A DISCOVERY IN RELATION TO
THE CAPTAIN WENT ON TO THE NEXT HOUSE AFFECTED TO RING THE BELL IN HIS TURN AND STOOD WITH HIS BACK TO THE TRAVELER IN APPEARANCE WAITING TO BE LET IN IN REALITY
AND THE TOWING PATH ON THE OTHER OPEN TO VIEW HERE WHERE THE STREET ENDS AND ON THE SIDE OF IT FURTHEST FROM THE RIVER A NARROW LITTLE LANE LEADS UP TO THE PAVED FOOTWAY SURMOUNTING THE ANCIENT WALLS OF YORK THE ONE SMALL ROW OF BUILDINGS
EVEN BY A POSTMASTER A BRIGHT IDEA STRUCK HIM HE TOOK OUT HIS POCKETBOOK IN WHICH ADMIRAL BARTRAM'S ADDRESS WAS WRITTEN AND RETURNED TO THE CHARGE SUPPOSE A LETTER HAS BEEN WRONGLY DIRECTED BY MISTAKE HE BEGAN
SHOULD BE REALIZED IN ONE YEAR'S TIME BY THE DOWRY OF HIS YOUNG WIFE AS HER FATHER DREW THAT PICTURE OF THE FUTURE THE OUTBURST OF MAGDALEN'S GRATITUDE COULD NO LONGER BE RESTRAINED SHE WAS DEEPLY TOUCHED
I ONLY WANT TO EXPLAIN MYSELF A LADY HAS POSTED A LETTER HERE
THE NOMINAL MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE FONDLY BELIEVED THAT THEIR CHIEF TROUBLES WERE OVER INNOCENT AND FATAL DELUSION IT IS ONE THING IN PRIVATE SOCIETY TO SET UP THE STAGE AND CHOOSE THE PLAY
PERMITTED HIMSELF TO TELL THE UNMITIGATED TRUTH THE EFFECT OF THE NARRATIVE ON MAGDALEN BY NO MEANS FULFILLED CAPTAIN WRAGGE'S ANTICIPATIONS IN RELATING IT SHE WAS NOT STARTLED SHE WAS NOT IRRITATED
AND FRANK SHALL KNOW WHAT WE DECIDE HER EYES BRIGHTENED AS THEY LOOKED INTO HIS FACE AND SAW THE DECISION THERE ALREADY WITH THE DOUBLE PENETRATION OF HER WOMANHOOD AND HER LOVE HAPPY AND BEAUTIFUL IN HER HAPPINESS
THE OUTLYING SUBURBS OF YORK ON ONE SIDE OF HIM A ROPE WALK AND SOME PATCHES OF KITCHEN GARDEN OCCUPYING A VACANT STRIP OF GROUND ON THE OTHER HE ADVANCED WITH EAGER EYES AND QUICKENED STEP FOR HE SAW BEFORE HIM THE LONELY FIGURE OF A WOMAN
WHERE THE CENTRAL ACTIVITY OF A GREAT RAILWAY ENTERPRISE BEATS WITH ALL THE PULSES OF ITS LOUD CLANGING LIFE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE DEAD MAJESTY OF THE PAST DEEP UNDER THE OLD HISTORIC STONES WHICH TELL OF FORTIFIED YORK AND THE SIEGES OF TWO CENTURIES SINCE
PRAY COMPOSE YOURSELF
AND ONLY THE PLEASURE OF IT REMAINED HER MOTHER HAD BEEN HER AGE ONCE HER MOTHER WOULD KNOW HOW FOND SHE WAS OF FRANK SO THE COMING INTERVIEW WAS ANTICIPATED IN HER THOUGHTS AND EXCEPT
THE FAMILY SPIRIT I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME MYSELF AT YOUR AGE
A CONFIDENCE WHICH HAD LED MISTER VANSTONE TO TAKE UNRESERVEDLY UPON HIMSELF THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF FRANK'S FUTURE PROSPECTS THE MARRIAGE SCHEME WAS TO BE CONSIDERED FROM THAT MOMENT
MISTER FRANCIS CLARE WAS TO SEND HIM FORTHWITH INTO ANOTHER QUARTER OF THE GLOBE
QUITE RIGHT MY DEAR OBSERVED MISTER VANSTONE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS YOU SAY WERE DEAD AGAINST ME HERE WERE THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN A SCRAPE ON ONE SIDE AND MAGDALEN ON THE OTHER MAD TO ACT
MIGHT BE REFERRED TO IF ANY CORROBORATION
JUST SO I WILL CALL AND SEE MISTER HUXTABLE AT THE SAME TIME ANY NAME SIR NO SAY A GENTLEMAN CALLED ON THEATRICAL BUSINESS THAT WILL BE ENOUGH WAIT ONE MINUTE IF YOU PLEASE I AM A STRANGER IN YORK WILL YOU KINDLY TELL ME WHICH IS THE WAY TO CONEY STREET
WITH HIS BACK CAREFULLY TURNED ON THE TRAVELER
THE GLORIOUS PROSPECT OF HIS SON'S BANISHMENT TO CHINA APPEARED TO TURN HIS BRAIN
AND HAVE FAILED TO LEAVE A PERMANENT IMPRESSION ON HIS MIND BUT WHEN SHE STAKED NOT ONLY HER POSITION IN HIS SERVICE BUT HER PECUNIARY CLAIMS ON HIM AS WELL SHE AT ONCE ABSORBED THE RULING PASSION OF HIS LIFE
FRANK'S HELPLESS ASTONISHMENT AT HER DISAPPEARANCE ADDED A NEW ELEMENT OF ABSURDITY TO THE SCENE HE STOOD FIRST ON ONE LEG AND THEN ON THE OTHER
IT WOULD ONLY BE NECESSARY TO DEVISE MEASURES FOR INTERCEPTING THE LETTER THE CAPTAIN DECIDED ON GOING TO THE POST OFFICE IN THE FIRST PLACE ASSUMING THAT THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD WRITTEN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT THE LETTER AT THE MERCY OF THE SERVANT
MISTER MARRABLE SECURED THE SERVICES OF A RESPECTABLE PROFESSIONAL PERSON TO DRILL THE YOUNG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND TO ACCEPT ALL THE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES INCIDENTAL TO CREATING A DRAMATIC WORLD OUT OF A DOMESTIC CHAOS
YOU ARE INEXPERIENCED YOU ARE IN IMMINENT DANGER HERE IS A POSITION OF EMERGENCY ON ONE SIDE AND HERE AM I ON THE OTHER WITH AN UNCLE'S INTEREST IN YOU FULL OF ADVICE
AND THE OTHER PART IS FAIRLY DIVIDED BETWEEN MY CHILDREN YOU WILL HAVE YOUR SHARE ON YOUR WEDDING DAY AND NORAH WILL HAVE HERS WHEN SHE MARRIES
MUCH SURPRISED YESTERDAY WERE WE NOT PAPA FRANK IS WONDERFULLY LUCKY ISN'T HE HE'S THE LUCKIEST DOG I EVER CAME ACROSS
THE FEW ATTEMPTS HE MADE TO VARY THE STERNLY PRACTICAL NATURE OF THE EVENING'S OCCUPATION BY SLIPPING IN COMPLIMENTS SIDELONG
HIS EMPLOYERS ACTING UNDER A SENSE OF THEIR OBLIGATION TO THE GENTLEMAN BY WHOM FRANK HAD BEEN RECOMMENDED HAD CONSIDERED THE QUESTION CAREFULLY AND HAD DECIDED
WHICH LOOPED UP ITS CURTAINS AND THE BRIGHT DRESS FOR DINNER LAID READY ACROSS IT ON THE GAYLY PAINTED BATH WITH ITS PURE LINING OF WHITE ENAMEL ON THE TOILET TABLE WITH ITS SPARKLING TRINKETS ITS CRYSTAL BOTTLES
THUS FAR NOT A SIGN OF HER THE CAPTAIN LOOKED ROUND HIM ATTENTIVELY AND WALKED ON HE REACHED THE SPOT WHERE THE IRON COURSE OF THE RAILROAD STRIKES ITS WAY THROUGH ARCHES IN THE OLD WALL HE PAUSED AT THIS PLACE
AND WAS THE SIGNAL ACCORDINGLY FOR AN ATTACK ON MISTER VANSTONE'S INVETERATE CARELESSNESS IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS PATERNAL AUTHORITY
COMMANDED AN UNINTERRUPTED PROSPECT OF NOEL VANSTONE'S HOUSE AND THERE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF ON THE WATCH
THROUGH AND THROUGH HER MISTRESS'S HAIR ALL CONVEYED THE SAME SOOTHING IMPRESSION OF DROWSY DELICIOUS QUIET ON ONE SIDE OF THE DOOR WERE THE BROAD DAYLIGHT AND THE FAMILIAR REALITIES OF LIFE
STEADILY REFUSED HIM THE OPPORTUNITY SHE KEPT HER FACE HIDDEN OVER HIS SHOULDER WAS SHE IN EARNEST HIS CHEEK STILL WET WITH HER TEARS ANSWERED FOR HER THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE OF SILENCE SHE WAITED WITH UNACCUSTOMED PATIENCE
WOULD IN A MOMENT HAVE PUT AN END TO HIS EXPEDITION ROUND HIS LITTLE FLEET A BOAT WAS ROWING IN WHICH WERE SOME PERSONS WITH TELESCOPES WHOM HE SUSPECTED TO BE SPIES BUT NO EFFECTUAL STEP WAS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETAINING HIM
IN THIS WAY ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED QUAKERS AND A STILL GREATER NUMBER OF ROMAN CATHOLICS
HAD THE HEART AND THE FOREHEAD TO APPEAR AS THE PRINCIPAL WITNESS AGAINST THEM THEY WERE CONVICTED FERNLEY WAS SENTENCED TO THE GALLOWS ELIZABETH GAUNT TO THE STAKE EVEN AFTER ALL THE HORRORS OF THAT YEAR
HE WAS THE RIGHT HEIR MALE
WHATEVER THE CIVIL TROUBLES HAD LEFT HEM THE LAWS WERE VIOLATED ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE SAFETY OF THE PROTECTOR'S PERSON AND GOVERNMENT WAS CONCERNED JUSTICE WAS ADMINISTERED BETWEEN MAN AND MAN
THAN ALICE LISLE THAN WILLIAM HEWLING THAN ANY OF THE HUNDREDS OF IGNORANT PEASANTS WHOSE SKULLS AND QUARTERS WERE EXPOSED IN SOMERSETSHIRE BUT GREY'S ESTATE WAS LARGE AND WAS STRICTLY ENTAILED HE HAD ONLY A LIFE INTEREST IN HIS PROPERTY
TRIBES AND GALAXIES THE LORD ARCHON AND THE LORD STRATEGUS WHICH BALLOT BOXES WERE TO BE GREEN AND WHICH RED WHICH BALLS WERE TO BE OF GOLD AND WHICH OF SILVER WHICH MAGISTRATES WERE TO WEAR HATS AND WHICH BLACK VELVET CAPS WITH PEAKS
HIS ILL CONCEALED DISLIKE OF THE MARRIAGE OF ECCLESIASTICS THE ARDENT AND NOT ALTOGETHER DISINTERESTED ZEAL WITH WHICH HE ASSERTED THE CLAIMS OF THE CLERGY TO THE REVERENCE OF THE LAITY WOULD HAVE MADE HIM AN OBJECT OF AVERSION TO THE PURITANS
TO TAKE A STEP WHICH HAS NO PARALLEL IN THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OF STUART
THAT NEVER MAN WAS SO COMPLETE A MASTER OF HIS TONGUE AND OF HIS PASSIONS WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT TREACHERY COULD DO NOTHING ARBITRARY POWER WAS USED AFTER VAINLY TRYING TO INVEIGLE LOCKE INTO A FAULT
AND SEPARATED THEMSELVES FOR EVER FROM THE GREAT BODY OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN ENGLAND WAS DECLARED A COMMONWEALTH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS REDUCED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF MEMBERS WAS NOMINALLY THE SUPREME POWER IN THE STATE IN FACT
WAS THE COUNSELLOR MOST TRUSTED IN POLITICAL AND MILITARY AFFAIRS
WE ARE INFORMED BY CLARENDON THAT THERE WAS HARDLY A MAN OF NOTE IN THE REALM
IN SOME UNJUSTIFIABLE TRANSACTIONS OF WHICH OTHERS ENJOYED THE PROFITS THE FIRST USE WHICH HE MADE OF HIS CREDIT WAS HIGHLY COMMENDABLE
ANYTHING WAS PREFERABLE TO THE YOKE OF A SUCCESSION OF INCAPABLE AND INGLORIOUS TYRANTS RAISED TO POWER
HE HAD BEEN TRIED AT THE OLD BAILEY FOR PREACHING IN DEFIANCE OF THE LAW
WHO HAD BEEN TRUE TO HIM IN HIS ADVERSITY THAT HE COULD EXPECT ABJECT AND UNSCRUPULOUS OBEDIENCE IN HIS PROSPERITY THE MEN WHO IMPELLED NOT BY ZEAL FOR LIBERTY OR FOR RELIGION
IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO A GENERATION WHICH HAS BEEN EXCITED ALMOST TO MADNESS BY THE QUESTION OF PARLIAMENTARY REFORM
AND HOW WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE WAS NO MORE AMSTERDAM WAS LIGHTED UP AS FOR A GREAT DELIVERANCE AND CHILDREN RAN ALONG THE CANALS SHOUTING FOR JOY THAT THE DEVIL WAS DEAD EVEN ROYALISTS
EITHER SHARE THE FATE OF THE SENATES OF THE CONTINENT OR OBTAIN SUPREME ASCENDENCY IN THE STATE JUST AT THIS CONJUNCTURE JAMES DIED CHARLES THE FIRST SUCCEEDED TO THE THRONE
HE HAD INDEED WHEN SHERIFF BEEN VERY UNWILLING TO EMPLOY AS HIS DEPUTY A MAN SO VIOLENT AND UNPRINCIPLED AS GOODENOUGH WHEN THE RYE HOUSE PLOT WAS DISCOVERED GREAT HOPES WERE ENTERTAINED AT WHITEHALL THAT CORNISH WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CONCERNED
THE RANK WHICH HE HAD INHERITED IN THE STATE AND THE HIGH COMMAND WHICH HE HAD BORNE IN THE REBEL ARMY
THE COURSE AFTERWARDS TAKEN BY MONK WAS NOT OPEN TO CROMWELL THE MEMORY OF ONE TERRIBLE DAY SEPARATED THE GREAT REGICIDE FOR EVER FROM THE HOUSE OF STUART WHAT REMAINED WAS THAT HE SHOULD MOUNT THE ANCIENT ENGLISH THRONE AND REIGN ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT ENGLISH POLITY
HE HAD CONSENTED TO PROFESS HIMSELF A PRESBYTERIAN
OR AFRAID OF MOVING AND REFUSED EVEN TO SEE THE SON OF THEIR CHIEF FROM DUNSTAFFNAGE THE SMALL ARMAMENT PROCEEDED TO CAMPBELLTOWN NEAR THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA OF KINTYRE
AND IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO DEAL AT ONCE
HE DIED WITH COURAGE AND WITH MANY PIOUS EXPRESSIONS BUT SHOWED BY LOOK AND GESTURE SUCH STRONG RESENTMENT AT THE BARBARITY AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED THAT HIS ENEMIES SPREAD A CALUMNIOUS REPORT CONCERNING HIM
FOR THE APPREHENSION OF BURTON BUT THE HONEST MAN WAS INCAPABLE OF BETRAYING ONE WHO IN EXTREME PERIL HAD COME UNDER THE SHADOW OF HIS ROOF
IT WAS PLAYED ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WITH KEENNESS BUT WITH ADMIRABLE DEXTERITY COOLNESS AND PERSEVERANCE GREAT STATESMEN WHO LOOKED FAR BEHIND THEM AND FAR BEFORE THEM WERE AT THE HEAD OF THAT ASSEMBLY
AND NEVER AGAIN TO SUBJECT HIS PEOPLE TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS MARTIAL THE DAY ON WHICH THE ROYAL SANCTION WAS AFTER MANY DELAYS SOLEMNLY GIVEN TO THIS GREAT ACT WAS A DAY OF JOY AND HOPE
THE PRESBYTERIANS OF SCOTLAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE DOWNFALL OF THEIR CHURCH THE PAPISTS OF IRELAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE LOSS OF THEIR LANDS AS FATHER OF THE DUCHESS OF YORK
THE PLACE WHERE ELIZABETH HAD WITH MANLY SPIRIT HURLED FOUL SCORN AT PARMA AND SPAIN WAS INSULTED BY THE INVADERS THE ROAR OF FOREIGN GUNS WAS HEARD
HE MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN PRIVY TO THE WHIG PLOT BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ONE OF THE LEADING CONSPIRATORS FOR IN THE GREAT MASS OF DEPOSITIONS PUBLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT HIS NAME OCCURS ONLY ONCE AND THEN NOT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CRIME
THE CLERK HAD PRONOUNCED THE ANCIENT FORM OF WORDS BY WHICH OUR PRINCES HAVE DURING MANY AGES
THE TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD THE PONDERATION OF AIR THE FIXATION OF MERCURY SUCCEEDED TO THAT PLACE IN THE PUBLIC MIND WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY OCCUPIED BY THE CONTROVERSIES OF THE ROTA
COMPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT TREATED THE MOST SERIOUS MATTERS AS TRIFLES AND MADE TRIFLES ITS SERIOUS BUSINESS A KING MIGHT BE PARDONED FOR AMUSING HIS LEISURE WITH WINE WIT AND BEAUTY BUT IT WAS INTOLERABLE
THESE CALUMNIES INDEED COULD FIND CREDIT ONLY WITH THE UNDISCERNING MULTITUDE BUT WITH THESE CALUMNIES WERE MINGLED ACCUSATIONS MUCH BETTER FOUNDED
WAS A TASK TOO HARD FOR THAT ADMINISTRATION
WHEN IT WAS NOISED ABROAD THAT THE COURT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO TREAT PAPISTS WITH THE SAME RIGOUR WHICH HAD BEEN SHOWN TO PRESBYTERIANS A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE KING AND THE DUKE WERE NOT SINCERE PROTESTANTS
HE WAS UNABLE TO PERCEIVE THAT THE TIME WAS FAST APPROACHING WHEN THAT HOUSE IF IT CONTINUED TO EXIST AT ALL MUST BE SUPREME IN THE STATE WHEN THE MANAGEMENT OF THAT HOUSE WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS AND WHEN
A DEFICIENCY IN THEIR REVENUE BY A BENEVOLENCE OR A FORCED LOAN BUT THESE EXPEDIENTS WERE ALWAYS OF A TEMPORARY NATURE TO MEET THE REGULAR CHARGE OF A LONG WAR BY REGULAR TAXATION
WHEN ONCE THE SLAUGHTER ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE IS OVER CAN SCARCELY BE TREATED TOO LENIENTLY THIS RULE SO EVIDENTLY AGREEABLE TO JUSTICE AND HUMANITY WAS NOT ONLY NOT OBSERVED IT WAS INVERTED
THE HERDSMEN AND FISHERMEN WERE INDEED READY TO RALLY ROUND MAC CALLUM MORE BUT OF THE HEADS OF THE CLAN SOME WERE IN CONFINEMENT AND OTHERS HAD FLED THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO REMAINED AT THEIR HOMES WERE EITHER WELL AFFECTED TO THE GOVERNMENT
THEN INSTEAD OF APPLYING AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE TO THE STATES GENERAL WHO SATE CLOSE TO HIS OWN DOOR
UNHAPPILY FOR HIM HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF DISPLAYING HIS ADMIRABLE MILITARY TALENTS EXCEPT AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES WHILE HE LIVED HIS POWER STOOD FIRM AN OBJECT OF MINGLED AVERSION ADMIRATION
OR A PRAYER MEETING AT HUNTINGDON HE SAW THAT SOME SCHEMES OF INNOVATION FOR WHICH HE HAD ONCE BEEN ZEALOUS WHETHER GOOD OR BAD IN THEMSELVES WERE OPPOSED TO THE GENERAL FEELING OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT IF HE PERSEVERED IN THOSE SCHEMES HE HAD NOTHING BEFORE HIM
FOR THEY WERE ALL READY TO CALL GOD TO WITNESS THAT THEY RENOUNCED ALL SPIRITUAL CONNECTION WITH FOREIGN PRELATES AND POTENTATES BUT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC WOULD NOT SWEAR THAT THE POPE HAD NO JURISDICTION IN ENGLAND AND THE QUAKER WOULD NOT SWEAR TO ANYTHING
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TWO ENGLISHMEN
HIS INTEREST HAD BEEN WEAKENED IN SOME PLACES BY THE REMODELLING OF THE WESTERN BOROUGHS HIS PRIDE HAD BEEN WOUNDED BY THE ELEVATION OF TREVOR TO THE CHAIR
AND OF WHOSE LOYALTY CERTIFICATES HAD BEEN PRODUCED TO THE GOVERNMENT THESE PERSONS WERE DISCHARGED AND ORDERS WERE GIVEN THAT NO SIMILAR PROCEEDING SHOULD BE INSTITUTED TILL THE ROYAL PLEASURE SHOULD BE FURTHER SIGNIFIED
AND THEY PURSUED THE OBJECTS OF THEIR WILD AMBITION NOT LIKE HIM
DURING A WHOLE GENERATION HIS PHILOSOPHY HAD AMIDST TUMULTS WARS AND PROSCRIPTIONS BEEN SLOWLY RIPENING IN A FEW WELL CONSTITUTED MINDS
REPORT TO HIM THAT NOT A SINGLE DISSENTER WAS TO BE FOUND
AND OF DOUBLEKEELED SHIPS WHICH WERE NEVER TO FOUNDER IN THE
HE WAS THE OSTENSIBLE HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WAS THEREFORE HELD RESPONSIBLE EVEN FOR THOSE ACTS WHICH HE HAD STRONGLY BUT VAINLY OPPOSED IN COUNCIL HE WAS REGARDED BY THE PURITANS
AND GREEDINESS OF THE STAR CHAMBER
MONARCHY HAS OFTEN STOOD WITHOUT THAT SUPPORT BUT A PATRICIAN ORDER IS THE WORK OF TIME OLIVER FOUND ALREADY EXISTING A NOBILITY OPULENT HIGHLY CONSIDERED AND AS POPULAR WITH THE COMMONALTY
SUFFERED DEATH IN CHEAPSIDE SHE LEFT A PAPER WRITTEN INDEED IN NO GRACEFUL STYLE YET SUCH AS WAS READ BY MANY THOUSANDS WITH COMPASSION AND HORROR MY FAULT SHE SAID
WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT THERE WAS MUCH DOUBT WHETHER THEIR CHAMBER AS IT WAS THEN FITTED UP WOULD AFFORD SUFFICIENT ACCOMMODATION FOR THEM THEY EMPLOYED THE DAYS WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED THE OPENING OF THE SESSION
HE HAD BEEN PERSECUTED BY THE WHIGS
SPRANG UP AND GATHERED STRENGTH MANY PERSONS TOO WHO HAD BEEN DISGUSTED BY THE AUSTERITY AND HYPOCRISY OF THE SAINTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH BEGAN TO BE STILL MORE DISGUSTED BY THE OPEN PROFLIGACY OF THE COURT AND OF THE CAVALIERS
WHICH THAT UNION HAD BOUND TOGETHER RETAINED ALMOST ALL THE RIGHTS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND ASSERTED THOSE RIGHTS PUNCTILIOUSLY AGAINST THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
AND TO CLAMOUR FOR PROTECTING LAWS FROM IRELAND THE VICTORIOUS CHIEF
THE REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT CEASING TO OPERATE IN POLITICS BEGAN TO EXERT ITSELF WITH UNPRECEDENTED VIGOUR AND HARDIHOOD IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS
NOT ONLY FROM CONSTITUTION AND FROM HABIT BUT ALSO ON PRINCIPLE HE SEEMS TO HAVE LEARNED FROM THE THEOLOGIANS WHOM HE MOST ESTEEMED THAT BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SUBJECTS
AND HAD FORMED A VAST AND DEEPLY MEDITATED SCHEME WHICH VERY NEARLY CONFOUNDED EVEN THE ABLE TACTICS OF THE STATESMEN BY WHOM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD BEEN DIRECTED
A CHIEF OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION WAS DECLARED TO BE THE ENTIRE SUPPRESSION
WHICH WAS UNPLEASING TO THEM THEY EITHER NEGLECTED IT ALTOGETHER OR EXECUTED IT LANGUIDLY AND TARDILY IN SOME TOWN COUNCILS INDEED THE INFLUENCE OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE WAS ALL POWERFUL
THE INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED WOULD HAVE EXCUSED HIM IF HE HAD RESORTED TO VIOLENT METHODS OF REDRESS BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE BLINDED BY PERSONAL RESENTMENT HE AUGURED NO GOOD FROM THE SCHEMES
THAT THE TYRANT SUFFERED NONE BUT HIMSELF TO WRONG HIS COUNTRY AND THAT
BUT ALSO OVER THE ENGLISH COLONISTS AND WAS ABLE TO BOAST THAT IN THAT ISLAND
HE WAS SAVED FROM DEATH BY AN ANCIENT MATRON OF THE BAPTIST PERSUASION NAMED ELIZABETH GAUNT THIS WOMAN
ENCOURAGING MESSAGES REACHED HIM IN QUICK SUCCESSION FROM LONDON HE WAS ASSURED THAT THE VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH THE ELECTIONS HAD BEEN CARRIED ON HAD DRIVEN THE NATION MAD
TO ESTABLISH BY THEIR AID A DICTATORSHIP SUCH AS NO KING HAD EVER EXERCISED BUT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THEIR AID WOULD BE AT ONCE WITHDRAWN FROM A RULER WHO EVEN UNDER STRICT CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINTS
KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH INDUCTION AND MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATION COOPERATE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF TRUTH THAT THE ENGLISH GENIUS WON IN THAT AGE THE MOST MEMORABLE TRIUMPHS
AND BEGAN TO TREAT THEM AS SUBJECTS
THAT THE FATHER OF A LARGE FAMILY WOULD RATHER BE BEREAVED OF ALL HIS CHILDREN BY ACCIDENT OR BY DISEASE THAN LOSE ONE OF THEM BY THE HANDS OF THE HANGMAN MURDER BY FALSE TESTIMONY IS THEREFORE THE MOST AGGRAVATED SPECIES OF MURDER
FOR ONE CLASS OF EXCLUSIONISTS STOOD HIGH IN HIS FAVOUR THAT CLASS OF WHICH SUNDERLAND WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE THAT CLASS WHICH HAD JOINED THE WHIGS IN THE DAYS OF THE PLOT MERELY BECAUSE THE WHIGS WERE PREDOMINANT
IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS MERITS BUT IT HAD MODERATION ENOUGH TO ABSTAIN FROM THOSE OPPRESSIONS WHICH DRIVE MEN MAD AND IT HAD A FORCE AND ENERGY WHICH NONE BUT MEN DRIVEN MAD BY OPPRESSION WOULD VENTURE TO ENCOUNTER
AND TOOK REFUGE IN THE HOUSE OF JOHN FERNLEY A BARBER IN WHITECHAPEL FERNLEY WAS VERY POOR HE WAS BESIEGED BY CREDITORS
TO THIS SCHEME IN HIS CONFIDENTIAL CORRESPONDENCE HE GAVE THE EXPRESSIVE NAME OF THOROUGH HIS OBJECT WAS TO DO IN ENGLAND ALL AND MORE THAN ALL
WHO HAD LONG RESIDED IN ENGLAND AS AMBASSADOR FROM THE UNITED PROVINCES AND EVERARD VAN DYKVELT WHO AFTER THE DEATH OF CHARLES HAD BEEN SENT BY THE STATE GENERAL ON A SPECIAL MISSION OF CONDOLENCE AND CONGRATULATION
AND HE WAS FORCED TO PROMISE THAT EVEN IN THE FIELD EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A SURPRISE HE WOULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT THE ASSENT OF A COUNCIL OF WAR MONMOUTH WAS TO COMMAND IN ENGLAND HIS SOFT MIND HAD AS USUAL
WESTMINSTER HALL WAS CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS AMONG WHOM WERE MANY ROMAN CATHOLICS
FOR THE WAR WITH HOLLAND HE WAS WITH LESS JUSTICE HELD ACCOUNTABLE HIS HOT TEMPER HIS ARROGANT DEPORTMENT THE INDELICATE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH HE GRASPED AT RICHES THE OSTENTATION WITH WHICH HE SQUANDERED THEM
BUT CONSTANT TROUBLES WHICH MUST BE SUPPRESSED BY THE CONSTANT USE OF THE SWORD HE THEREFORE WISHED TO RESTORE IN ALL ESSENTIALS THAT ANCIENT CONSTITUTION WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND FOR WHICH THEY NOW PINED
AND THOSE WHO HAD ASSAILED AND UNDERMINED HIM BEGAN TO STRUGGLE FOR THE FRAGMENTS OF HIS POWER
THE POWER WHICH THESE BOARDS HAD POSSESSED BEFORE THE ACCESSION OF CHARLES HAD BEEN EXTENSIVE AND FORMIDABLE BUT HAD BEEN SMALL INDEED WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH THEY NOW USURPED
BUT DARING AND INGENIOUS MEN MIGHT INDEMNIFY THEMSELVES BY TREATING WITH DISDAIN WHAT HAD LATELY BEEN CONSIDERED AS THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF NATURE THE TORRENT WHICH HAD BEEN DAMMED UP IN ONE CHANNEL RUSHED VIOLENTLY INTO ANOTHER
ARGYLE HAS THE GREATEST MEANS OF ANNOYING ME AND OF ALL PLACES HOLLAND IS THAT WHENCE A BLOW MAY BE BEST AIMED AGAINST ME THE DUTCH ENVOYS ASSURED HIS MAJESTY THAT WHAT HE HAD SAID SHOULD INSTANTLY BE COMMUNICATED TO THE GOVERNMENT
TO FINE IMPRISON
BETWEEN JAMES AND PENN THERE HAD LONG BEEN A FAMILIAR ACQUAINTANCE THE QUAKER NOW BECAME A COURTIER AND ALMOST A FAVOURITE HE WAS EVERY DAY SUMMONED FROM THE GALLERY INTO THE CLOSET
GUILDFORD HAD RECOMMENDED SIR THOMAS MERES WHO LIKE HIMSELF RANKED AMONG THE TRIMMERS JEFFREYS WHO MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY OF CROSSING THE LORD KEEPER
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
EXTENDING OVER THE ENTIRE BALKAN LANDS AND FURTHER OF A CONSTITUTIONAL UNION IN IMITATION OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE THAT IS PERHAPS ONLY A POLITICAL STRAW BLOWN BY THE STORM
AND HUNDREDS OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCES HAD TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE TRUE TO LIFE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN AT THIS SOLEMN AFTERNOON HOUR WERE SITTING BEHIND DAINTY PORCELAIN AND SILVER FITTINGS
OPEN LETTER YOU ARE A LITERARY MAN THE AUTHOR OF SEVERAL WELL KNOWN BOOKS I AM ENGAGE ON A BOOK AT THE PRESENT MOMENT RATHER BUSILY ENGAGED
SAID LADY PROWCHE NOT TO MY DYING DAY SHALL I FORGET LAST YEAR'S UPHEAVAL OVER THE SUFFRAGETTE QUESTION LAURA HENNISEED LEFT THE HOUSE IN A STATE OF SPEECHLESS INDIGNATION
CUSHAT PRINKLY HAD NEVER EXPOUNDED HIS VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT TO HIS MOTHER ALL HER LIFE SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TINKLE PLEASANTLY AT TEA TIME BEHIND DAINTY PORCELAIN AND SILVER
OR DO THEY BOTH UPHOLD THE NECESSITY FOR SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CORRESPONDENCE ON THE SUBJECT IN OUR LOCAL NEWSPAPERS OF LATE AND THE VICAR IS CERTAIN TO PREACH A SERMON ABOUT IT
HOW IS YOUR MOTHER'S RHEUMATISM SHE SAID THE AUTHOR'S LABOURS WERE CUT SHORT BY THE SUDDEN INTRUSION OF A MAIDSERVANT A GENTLEMAN TO SEE YOU SIR
AND BETTER SKILLED IN WAR CRAFT THAN HE HAD DEEMED POSSIBLE IN THAT QUARTER HIS EYES HAD TO READ IN THE COLUMNS OF HIS ACCUSTOMED NEWSPAPER A WARNING TO THE GROSSMACHTE THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING NEW TO LEARN SOMETHING
INDIFFERENT ABOUT THE SUBJECT AND THAT IS ALL I WANT TO KNOW
PERFECTLY GOOD TERMS AT BREAKFAST NOW MISS LARBOR JONES WHO WAS STAYING HERE LAST YEAR WORSHIPS LLOYD GEORGE AS A SORT OF WINGLESS ANGEL WHILE MISSUS WALTERS WHO WAS DOWN HERE AT THE SAME TIME
WHEN HIS THOUGHTS ARE NOT COMPLIMENTARY BRITISH TRAVELLERS HAD VISITED THE BALKAN LANDS AND REPORTED HIGH THINGS OF THE BULGARIANS AND THEIR FUTURE RUSSIAN OFFICERS HAD TAKEN PEEPS AT THEIR ARMY AND CONFESSED
WHY HAS IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU TO ATTEMPT SOMETHING FAR MORE TERRIFIC WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE ASKED HIM EAGERLY CREATE DO YOU MEAN CREATE DISTURBANCES
THAN A HARE OR PARTRIDGE HE HAD CONSTITUTED HIMSELF THE CRITICAL APPRAISER AND ARBITER
THE SECRET OF THEIR INTENTIONS HAD NOT BEEN WELL KEPT AND THEIR OPPONENTS LET LOOSE AT THE SAME MOMENT A RIVAL SWARM OF PARROTS WHICH SCREECHED I DON'T THINK AND OTHER HOSTILE CRIES
IMAGINE SEEING IT DOMINATE THE LANDSCAPE AT ASCOT AND TRYING TO KEEP YOUR EYE OFF IT ON THE SANDWICH GOLF LINKS WHAT HAVE YOUR COUNTRYMEN DONE TO DESERVE SUCH A THING
A LOOK OF FRIGHTENED DESPAIR CREPT INTO HER EYES NEVER IN ANY NOVEL THAT SHE HAD READ HAD A DEFENCELESS YOUNG WOMAN BEEN CONFRONTED WITH A SITUATION LIKE THIS SIR JOHN THE HUGO OF HER IMAGINATION WAS
DERIVED FROM THE CONVERSATION OF THOSE WHO WERE SKILLED IN THE ART OF NOVELETTE READING BERT FILLED IN A FEW DAMAGING DETAILS FROM HIS OWN LIMITED IMAGINATION SHE'S A BAD LOT THAT ONE IS DECLARED EMMELINE AFTER A LONG UNFRIENDLY STARE
WOULD BE ALTOGETHER WIPED OUT BOTH SIDES WERE HOPEFUL BUT NEITHER COULD FEEL CONFIDENT THE CHILDREN WERE A GREAT SUCCESS THE LITTLE JUTTERLYS DROVE THEIR CHUBBY DONKEYS SOLEMNLY UP AND DOWN THE MAIN STREETS DISPLAYING POSTERS
BERTHA IS A FAT LITTLE FOOL SAID VICTOR IN A VOICE THAT WAS AS LOUD AS HIS MOTHER'S AND HAD MORE ASSURANCE IN IT VICTOR YOU ARE NOT TO SAY SUCH THINGS BERTHA IS NOT A FOOL AND SHE IS NOT IN THE LEAST FAT
THE BALLOT BOX WAS TEMPORARILY FORGOTTEN IN THE CULT OF THE COLLECTING BOX THE DAUGHTERS OF THE HORSELEECH WERE NOT MORE PERSISTENT IN THEIR DEMANDS
SUDDENLY HOWEVER THEIR TALK TOOK A DRAMATICALLY INTERESTING TURN AND ALETHIA LISTENED WITH WIDE EYED ATTENTION
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN BUYING UP BUILDING SITES IN COMMANDING SITUATIONS IN AND AROUND THE METROPOLIS TWO OR THREE I'M TOLD ARE ON THE ROAD TO BRIGHTON AND ANOTHER NEAR ASCOT YOU DON'T MEAN TO FORTIFY THEM DO YOU

I'LL GET MY BROTHER IN LAW TO LET ME HAVE THEM ADDRESSED TO HIS OFFICE AND HE CAN TELEPHONE THE RESULT OF THE PLEBISCITE DIRECT TO YOU THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH SAID LADY PROWCHE GRATEFULLY
THANK GOODNESS IN THIS COUNTRY WE DON'T FLY INTO VIOLENT PASSIONS ABOUT WAGNER AND BRAHMS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT THERE IS ONLY ONE THORNY SUBJECT THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SURE ABOUT
LUITPOLD WOLKENSTEIN READ NO MORE THAN THE FIRST ARTICLE IN HIS PAPER BUT READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN THE TURKISH FORTRESS OF KIRK KILISSEH HAS FALLEN THE SERBS IT IS OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED
THAT WILL SAVE ME THE TROUBLE OF WRITING FOR DEAR BERTHA WITH VICTOR'S LOVE ON A BIT OF PAPER VERY WELL SAID HIS MOTHER WE CAN GO TO MANCHESTER SQUARE ON OUR WAY HOME
YOU HAVE IT ALL IN ONE COMPACT VOLUME NO MATTER WHAT THE SUBJECT MAY BE WHICH YOU WISH TO LOOK UP OR THE FACT YOU DESIRE TO VERIFY RIGHT HERE GIVES YOU ALL THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW IN THE BRIEFEST AND MOST ENLIGHTENING FORM
A RECOUNT WAS DEMANDED BUT FAILED TO ESTABLISH THE FACT THAT THE COLONIAL SECRETARY HAD OBTAINED A MAJORITY ALTOGETHER THE ELECTION LEFT A LEGACY OF SORENESS BEHIND IT APART FROM ANY THAT WAS EXPERIENCED BY HYACINTH IN PERSON
ONE MORNING IN DECEMBER AUGUSTUS SAT IN HIS WRITING ROOM AT WORK ON THE THIRD CHAPTER OF HIS EIGHTH NOVEL
WHETHER ONE SYMPATHISES WITH THE AGITATION FOR FEMALE SUFFRAGE OR NOT ONE HAS TO ADMIT THAT ITS PROMOTERS SHOWED TIRELESS ENERGY AND CONSIDERABLE ENTERPRISE
THEREBY ROBBING THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE UNANIMITY WHICH ALONE COULD HAVE MADE IT POLITICALLY IMPRESSIVE IN THE PROCESS OF RECAPTURE THE BIRDS LEARNED A QUANTITY OF ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE
AT MOST OF THE STATIONS NO ONE SEEMED TO WANT TO GET INTO THE TRAIN OR TO LEAVE IT BUT AT ONE THERE WERE SEVERAL MARKET FOLK ON THE PLATFORM AND TWO MEN OF THE FARMER OR SMALL CATTLE DEALER CLASS ENTERED ALETHIA'S CARRIAGE
THEN I BOLTED THE DOOR AND LEFT THEM THERE YOU WICKED
HIS MEDITERRANEAN MUSINGS WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE SOUND OF A CLOCK STRIKING THE HALF HOUR HALF PAST FOUR A FROWN OF DISSATISFACTION SETTLED ON HIS FACE
I WON'T LET THE LITTLE BEAST KISS ME STIPULATED VICTOR HIS MOTHER SAID NOTHING VICTOR HAD NOT BEEN HALF AS TROUBLESOME AS SHE HAD ANTICIPATED WHEN HE CHOSE HE COULD REALLY BE DREADFULLY NAUGHTY
FAR AS THE EYE COULD STRETCH ROLLED THE MAUVE AND PURPLE BILLOWS OF HEATHER
YOU CAN'T EXPECT A MAN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE TRIBAL DISPUTES OF CENTRAL ASIAN CLANSMEN WHEN HE'S GOT SOCIAL FEUDS BLAZING UNDER HIS OWN ROOF
AND THOSE ABOUT TO DIE HAD NOT SALUTED HAD NO INTENTION OF SALUTING A LESSON WAS BEING IMPOSED ON UNWILLING LEARNERS A LESSON OF RESPECT FOR CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
I'LL TEACH THE BLIGHTERS TO WIN ELECTIONS FROM US HE MEANS IT SAID MISSUS PANSTREPPON I FEARED THE WORST WHEN I SAW THAT BUTTERSCOTCH INCIDENT IT'S ALL RIGHT MY LITTLE MAN SAID JUTTERLY WITH THE DUPLICITY TO WHICH EVEN A COLONIAL SECRETARY CAN SOMETIMES STOOP
I THOUGHT THEY AGREED ON EVERY SUBJECT THAT ONE COULD VIOLENTLY DISAGREE ABOUT RELIGION POLITICS VIVISECTION THE DERBY DECISION THE FALCONER REPORT WHAT ELSE WAS THERE LEFT TO QUARREL ABOUT
TO WHOM THEY WERE REFERRING THE ALLUSION TO A PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATURE SETTLED THAT WHAT COULD ROBERT BLUDWARD HAVE DONE WHAT MANNER OF MAN COULD HE BE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD SPEAK OF HIM WITH SUCH OBVIOUS REPROBATION
I WONDER IF YOU WOULD CARE FOR ONE OF MY EARLIER BOOKS THE RELUCTANCE OF LADY CULLUMPTON
AND WAS NOW MADE MONSTROUS AND SYMBOLICAL WITH A SECOND HEAD GRAFTED ON TO ITS NECK AND A GILT CROWN PLANTED ON EITHER DUSTY SKULL TO DAY
BUT IMAGINE WHAT LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF ONE SAW THAT ERECTION CONFRONTING ONE WHEREVER ONE WENT IMAGINE THE EFFECT ON PEOPLE WITH TIRED HARASSED NERVES WHO SAW IT THREE TIMES ON THE WAY TO BRIGHTON AND THREE TIMES ON THE WAY BACK
SHE ANNOUNCED THERE'S CAVIARE IN THAT JAR AT YOUR ELBOW BEGIN ON THAT BROWN BREAD AND BUTTER WHILE I CUT SOME MORE FIND YOURSELF A CUP THE TEAPOT IS BEHIND YOU NOW TELL ME ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THINGS
SAW THE LITTLE SHEEPSKIN CLAD MANNIKINS DRIVEN BACK TO THEIR VILLAGES SAW THE AUGUSTLY CHIDING SPOKESMAN OF THE POWERS DICTATING ADJUSTING RESTORING SETTLING THINGS ONCE AGAIN IN THEIR ALLOTTED PLACES
THAT EUROPE CANNOT PERMIT ANY FRESH PARTITION OF TERRITORY IN THE EAST WITHOUT HER APPROVAL EVEN NOW WHILE THE CAMPAIGN IS STILL UNDECIDED THERE ARE RUMOURS OF A PROJECT OF FISCAL UNITY
HYACINTH STOOPED DOWN FROM HIS PERCH AND PUT HIS FINGER ON THE BOLT THE SOW PRESSED FURIOUSLY AGAINST THE DOOR BANG CAME ANOTHER SHOT HYACINTH WRIGGLED BACK AND SENT A SHORT LADDER DOWN THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE INNER STYE
JUST AS ONE MIGHT ADMIRE THE ALPS WITHOUT FEELING THAT ONE WANTED ANY PARTICULAR PEAK AS ONE'S OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY HIS LACK OF INITIATIVE IN THIS MATTER
WITHOUT DRAWN OUT CHATTER ABOUT CREAM AND SUGAR AND HOT WATER IF ONE'S SOUL WAS REALLY ENSLAVED AT ONE'S MISTRESS'S FEET HOW COULD ONE TALK COHERENTLY ABOUT WEAKENED TEA
AND MEET THIS MAN ON LEVEL TERMS
A LOCALITY ABOUT WHICH SHE KNEW LITTLE BEYOND THE ASSURANCE CONTAINED IN THE MISSIONARY HYMN THAT THE HUMAN ELEMENT THERE WAS VILE THEY WERE NOT OF MUCH IMMEDIATE USE TO HER OTHER COUSINS SHE ALSO POSSESSED
THERE YOU SEE THERE IT ALL IS NOTHING LACKING EXCEPT THE MATERNAL INSTINCT IN THE MINORCA
A SUDDEN ROAR OF SHOUTING AND CHEERING WAS HEARD FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE TOWN HALL HYACINTH'S FATHER CLUTCHED A PITCHFORK AND PREPARED TO DASH INTO THE STYE IN THE FORLORN HOPE OF BEING IN TIME A SHOT RANG OUT IN THE EVENING AIR
THE COLDLY REASONED OR UNREASONED REPLY WAS THAT THEY'D BETTER NOT THEIR PLIGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUMMED UP IN A PERVERSION OF GILBERT'S LINES TWENTY VOTELESS MILLIONS WE VOTELESS ALL AGAINST OUR WILL
HE WAS HISSED DOWN AT SHOALFORD YESTERDAY SAID ONE OF THE SPEAKERS
WHO WAS LATE IN ARRIVING BUT THE SUFFRAGETTES INTERRUPTED THE NEPHEW WHAT DID THEY DO NEXT AFTER THE BIRD FIASCO SAID SIR LULWORTH THE MILITANT SECTION MADE A DEMONSTRATION OF A MORE AGGRESSIVE NATURE
AND WHEN HIS UNCLE JULES DEPARTED THIS LIFE AND BEQUEATHED HIM A COMFORTABLE LITTLE LEGACY IT REALLY SEEMED THE CORRECT THING TO DO TO SET ABOUT DISCOVERING SOME ONE TO SHARE IT WITH HIM
I SPECT SHE'S GOING AWAY IN A KERRIDGE TO MARRY THE RICH LORD HAZARDED BERT SHE'S UP TO NO GOOD SAID EMMELINE VAGUELY INSIDE THE SHOP THE PURCHASE OF THE DOLL HAD BEEN DECIDED ON
E KNOCKS ER ABART SAID BERT WITH ENTHUSIASM NO E DON'T COS E'S DEAD SHE POISONED IM SLOW AND GRADUAL SO THAT NOBODY DIDN'T KNOW NOW SHE WANTS TO MARRY A LORD WITH EAPS AND EAPS OF MONEY
SHE WORE THE AIR OF ONE WHO IS NOT INTERESTED IN CRICKET AND NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN LIFE SHE SHOOK HANDS LIMPLY WITH LENA AND REMARKED THAT IT WAS A BEASTLY DAY
THAT SAID CAIAPHAS IS WHY THIS BOOK THAT I AM INTRODUCING TO YOUR NOTICE IS NOT A BOOK THAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO BE WITHOUT RIGHT HERE IS INDISPENSABLE FOR THE WRITING MAN
CHILDREN WITH HYACINTH'S TEMPERAMENT DON'T KNOW BETTER AS THEY GROW OLDER THEY MERELY KNOW MORE NONSENSE
AWFUL HYAENAS COULD NOT HAVE BEHAVED WITH GREATER SAVAGERY SIR RICHARD SAID SO AND HE HAS BEEN IN COUNTRIES WHERE HYAENAS LIVE SO HE OUGHT TO KNOW THEY ACTUALLY CAME TO BLOWS
HE'S A DELIGHTFUL CHILD OF COURSE BUT THERE IS A STRAIN OF UNBRIDLED PUGNACITY IN HIM THAT BREAKS OUT AT TIMES IN A REALLY ALARMING FASHION YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN THE AFFAIR OF THE LITTLE GAFFIN CHILDREN I HAVEN'T
A BOY THAT I'VE PALLED WITH IS GOING TO FIRE A GUN WHEN THE POLL IS DECLARED TWO SHOTS IF WE'VE WON ONE SHOT IF WE HAVEN'T THE SITUATION BEGAN TO LOOK CRITICAL DRUG THE SOW WHISPERED HYACINTH'S FATHER SOME ONE WENT OFF IN THE MOTOR TO THE NEAREST CHEMIST'S SHOP
DID YOU SEE THE WAY THE ARGUS SHOWED HIM UP THIS WEEK PROPERLY EXPOSED HIM HIP AND THIGH I TELL YOU AND SO ON THEY RAN IN THEIR WITHERING INDICTMENT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS ALETHIA'S COUSIN AND PROSPECTIVE HOST
WHO HAD LATELY RETURNED FROM A MUCH ENLIVENED EXILE IN THE WILDS OF MEXICO
AND THE OCCUPANTS OF THE DONKEY CART ACCEPTED HIS OFFERING WITH POLITE SOLEMNITY THE GROWN UP MEMBERS OF BOTH POLITICAL CAMPS WERE DELIGHTED AT THE INCIDENT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MISSUS PANSTREPPON WHO SHUDDERED NEVER WAS CLYTEMNESTRA'S KISS
THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR MEN IN MY CLUB WHO CAN NOT ONLY TELL ME WHAT HORSE WON IN ANY GIVEN YEAR BUT WHAT HORSE OUGHT TO HAVE WON AND WHY IT DIDN'T IF YOUR BOOK COULD SUPPLY A METHOD FOR PROTECTING ONE FROM INFORMATION OF THAT SORT
MORE DISTANT AS REGARDS RELATIONSHIP BUT NOT QUITE SO GEOGRAPHICALLY REMOTE SEEING THAT THEY LIVED SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDLANDS SHE COULD HARDLY REMEMBER EVER HAVING MET THEM BUT ONCE OR TWICE IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS
NOW VICTOR YOU ARE TO COME IN AND BUY A NICE DOLL FOR YOUR COUSIN BERTHA SHE GAVE YOU A BEAUTIFUL BOX OF SOLDIERS ON YOUR BIRTHDAY AND YOU MUST GIVE HER A PRESENT ON HERS
THEY HAD EXPRESSED A POLITE WISH THAT SHE SHOULD PAY THEM A VISIT THEY HAD PROBABLY NOT BEEN UNDULY DEPRESSED BY THE FACT THAT HER AUNT'S FAILING HEALTH HAD PREVENTED HER FROM ACCEPTING THEIR INVITATION THE NOTE OF CONDOLENCE
THERE WAS THE FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN THEY ENLIVENED AND DIVERSIFIED THE CUSTOMARY PAGEANTRY OF THE ROYAL PROGRESS TO OPEN PARLIAMENT BY LETTING LOOSE THOUSANDS OF PARROTS
IF ANYTHING RATHER MORE DEPRAVED AND DESPICABLE THAN ROBERT BLUDWARD HE WAS MEAN EVASIVE CALLOUSLY INDIFFERENT TO HIS COUNTRY'S INTERESTS A CHEAT
BY PESSIMISTIC REFLECTIONS ON SIR EDWARD CARSON'S DESTINATION IN THE LIFE TO COME IN FACT THE BIRD IN POLITICS IS A FACTOR THAT SEEMS TO HAVE COME TO STAY QUITE RECENTLY AT A POLITICAL GATHERING
THIS IS ONE OF THE NEWEST THINGS WE HAVE IN DOLLS SAID THE ASSISTANT REMOVING A HOBBLE SKIRTED FIGURE IN PEACH COLOURED VELVET FROM THE WINDOW
GIVES YOU THE SCENERY TRAFFIC FERRY BOAT CHARGES THE PREVALENT TYPES OF FISH BOATMEN'S SLANG TERMS
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T SAID CUSHAT PRINKLY IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD ME AT LUNCH TIME TO DAY THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK RHODA ELLAM TO MARRY ME AND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO ACCEPT ME I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT THE IDEA
HE DIDN'T CARE A TWOPENNY FIDDLESTRING ABOUT THE CAUSE BUT HE RATHER ENJOYED THE IDEA OF HAVING HIS FINGER IN THE POLITICAL PIE ALSO IT IS POSSIBLE THOUGH I SHOULD THINK HIGHLY IMPROBABLE THAT HE ADMIRED LENA DUBARRI ANYHOW
THE ELECTION WAS KEENLY BUT DECOROUSLY CONTESTED THE NEWLY APPOINTED COLONIAL SECRETARY WAS PERSONALLY POPULAR WHILE THE GOVERNMENT TO WHICH HE ADHERED WAS DISTINCTLY UNPOPULAR AND THERE WAS SOME EXPECTANCY THAT THE MAJORITY OF FOUR HUNDRED OBTAINED AT THE LAST ELECTION
SHE'S GREEDY TOO IF THERE'S FISH GOING SHE EATS ER OWN SHARE AND ER LITTLE GIRL'S AS WELL
AND EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO BRING UP OBSTINATELY WAVERING ELECTORS IT WAS WITH A FEELING OF RELAXATION AND RELIEF THAT EVERY ONE HEARD THE CLOCKS STRIKE THE HOUR FOR THE CLOSE OF THE POLL
AND JAMES BECAME GRADUALLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE IDEA THAT HE AND JOAN WOULD GO TOGETHER THROUGH THE PRESCRIBED STAGES OF CONGRATULATIONS PRESENT RECEIVING NORWEGIAN OR MEDITERRANEAN HOTELS
HELD IN A DIMLY LIGHTED PLACE OF WORSHIP THE CONGREGATION GAVE A RESPECTFUL HEARING FOR NEARLY TEN MINUTES TO A JACKDAW FROM WAPPING UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE LISTENING TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER
AT A POINT FIFTEEN MILES DISTANT SIX WEEKS LATER AT THE BASE OF THE HILLS THE WATER CONTINUED SCALDING HOT AND SENT FORTH STEAM AT EVERY WASH OF THE WAVES
THE DESTRUCTION OF SANTA ROSA IN SANTA ROSA SIXTY MILES TO THE NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO AND ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TOWNS OF CALIFORNIA PRACTICALLY EVERY BUILDING WAS DESTROYED OR BADLY DAMAGED
WAS SAFE EVERY POUND OF GUNCOTTON DID ITS WORK AND THOUGH THE RUINS BURNED IT WAS BUT FEEBLY FROM GOLDEN GATE AVENUE NORTH THE FIRE CROSSED THE WIDE STREET IN BUT ONE PLACE
THE SUPERSTITION REGARDING THE GODDESS PELE WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE RECEIVED A DEATH BLOW IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE WHEN KAPIOLANI AN HAWAIIAN PRINCESS AND A CHRISTIAN CONVERT ASCENDED WITH NUMEROUS ATTENDANTS TO THE CRATER OF KILAUEA
TRANSFIXED I STOOD NOT KNOWING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FLEE
BELOW DECKS THERE WERE SOME TWENTY ALIVE THE SHIP WAS ON FIRE OF COURSE WHAT WAS LEFT OF IT THE STUMPS OF BOTH MASTS WERE BLAZING AFT SHE WAS LIKE A FURNACE BUT FORWARD THE FLAMES HAD NOT GOT BELOW DECK
IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT INSTEAD OF THIS BEING A LOCAL CATASTROPHE THE FULL FORCE OF THE SEISMIC WAVES HAD TRAVELLED FROM UKIAH IN THE NORTH TO MONTEREY IN THE SOUTH A DISTANCE OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES
BEARING ON ITS SURFACE HUGE ROCKS AND IMMENSE BOULDERS OF TONS WEIGHT AS WATER WOULD CARRY A TOY BOAT
AS SOON AS ONE WOULD BE INCLINED TO WALK ON COOLING IRON IN A FOUNDRY THIS NOTABLE FLOW FINALLY CEASED WITHIN HALF A MILE OF HILO WHERE ITS BLACK FORM IS A PERPETUAL REMINDER OF A MARVELLOUS DELIVERANCE FROM DESTRUCTION
ALONG ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT WAS SO HOT THAT ALL HANDS GOT TO TALKING ABOUT IT WE RECKONED THAT SOMETHING QUEER WAS COMING OFF BUT NONE OF US COULD EXPLAIN WHAT IT WAS YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE PITCH SOFTENING IN THE SEAMS
WELL THAT SORT OF THING WENT ON HOUR AFTER HOUR THE WAVES THE LIGHTNING THE HOT WATER AND THE SHARKS AND ALL THE REST OF THE ODD THINGS HAPPENING FRIGHTENED THE CREW OUT OF THEIR WITS
IT WAS ONLY AN EMPTY VICTORY FOR THE FIRE AS BARE BRICK AND SMOKING RUINS ARE POOR FOOD FOR FLAMES CAPTAIN MAC BRIDE'S DYNAMITING SQUAD HAD REALIZED THAT A STAND WAS HOPELESS EXCEPT ON VAN NESS AVENUE
AND FOR MANY MILES NORTH FROM LOS ANGELES MINIATURE GEYSERS ARE SAID TO HAVE SPOUTED VOLCANO LIKE STREAMS OF HOT MUD RAILROAD TRACKS IN SOME LOCALITIES WERE BADLY INJURED SINKING OR LIFTING
THEY LYING EASTWARD OF THE SEAT OF SERIOUS EARTHQUAKE ACTIVITY LOS ANGELES AND SANTA BARBARA ESCAPED WITH A SLIGHT TREMBLING STOCKTON ONE HUNDRED THREE MILES NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO
IN ITS VICINITY ARE THE FAMOUS GARDENS OF LUTHER BURBANK THE CALIFORNIA WIZARD BUT THESE FORTUNATELY ESCAPED INJURY AT SAN JOSE ANOTHER VERY BEAUTIFUL CITY OF OVER TWENTY THOUSAND POPULATION
AND SEVERAL OF THESE AT THE SAME TIME VOMITED FROM THEIR IGNITED MOUTHS STREAMS OF LAVA WHICH ROLLED IN BLAZING TORRENTS DOWN THEIR BLACK INDENTED SIDES INTO THE BOILING MASS BELOW
THE ENGINE BECAME CHOKED THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER ANXIOUS MOMENT SHORTLY AFTER NINE O'CLOCK THIRD ENGINEER RENNIE HAD BEEN RUNNING THE DONKEY ENGINE WHEN SUDDENLY IT CHOKED AND WHEN HE FINALLY GOT IT CLEAR FROM THE SAND OR ASHES HE FOUND THE VALVES WERE ALL CUT OUT
IT MOVED WITH A RAPIDITY THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYTHING TO ESCAPE IT FROM THE CLOUD CAME EXPLOSIONS THAT SOUNDED AS THOUGH ALL OF THE NAVIES OF THE WORLD WERE IN TITANIC COMBAT
THEY HEROICALLY RESPONDED TO THE DEMAND OF LAW AND WENT BRAVELY ON THEIR WAY LEAVING THEIR LOVED HOMES AND TRUDGING PAINFULLY OVER THE PAVEMENTS WITH THE LITTLE THEY COULD CARRY AWAY OF THEIR TREASURED POSSESSIONS
THANKS TO THAT TIDAL WAVE THAT CLEARED OUR DECKS THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO BURN SO WE GOT THE FIRE DOWN SO'S WE COULD LIVE ON BOARD WITH IT FOR SEVERAL HOURS MORE AND THEN THE FOUR TURNED TO TO KNOCK A RAFT TOGETHER OUT OF WHAT TIMBER AND TRUCK WE COULD FIND BELOW
AND IT WAS MEN OF THIS KIND WHO FINALLY SAVED WHAT IS LEFT TO DAY OF THE CITY THREE MEN SAVED SAN FRANCISCO SO FAR AS ANY SAN FRANCISCO EXISTED AFTER THE FIRE HAD WORKED ITS WILL
A SECOND INTENSELY YELLOW IN TINT AND THE THIRD OF A BRILLIANT EMERALD GREEN THE MOUNTAIN STILL STEAMS AND FUMES AS IF TOO ACTIVELY AT WORK BELOW TO BE AT REST ABOVE
SEEKING TO SLIP THROUGH THE GUARDS AND LOOT STORES AND ROB THE DEAD IN THE BURNING SECTION ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO THE SOLDIERS TO KILL ALL WHO WERE ENGAGED IN SUCH WORK AND THESE ORDERS WERE CARRIED OUT
WE MUST REMEMBER HOWEVER THAT WHAT IS ABOVE SEA LEVEL IS ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT SINCE IT SWEEPS DOWN BELOW THE WAVES HUNDREDS OF MILES ON EVERY SIDE CRATER OF HALEAKALA
TAYLOR MANAGED TO PUSH THE CAPTAIN ON TO A HATCH THAT HAD FLOATED OFF FROM US AND THEN THEY SWAM BACK TO THE SHIP FOR MORE ASSISTANCE BUT NOTHING COULD BE DONE FOR THE CAPTAIN
SO DEAD THAT THE FLOATING DUST SEEMINGLY WAS NOT DISTURBED THEN THERE WAS A RENDING CRASHING GRINDING NOISE WHICH I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS SOUNDING AS THOUGH EVERY BIT OF MACHINERY IN THE WORLD HAD SUDDENLY BROKEN DOWN
THE PLACE BEING TO A LARGE EXTENT DESTROYED WITH AN ESTIMATED LOSS OF OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS THE SPRECKELS SUGAR FACTORY AND A SCORE OF OTHER BUILDINGS WERE REPORTED RUINED AND A NUMBER OF LIVES LOST
BUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE CENTRE ITSELF APPEARED INDEPENDENT AND ALWAYS TOOK A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION BEFORE EACH OUTBURST OF AGITATION THERE WAS MUCH HISSING AND THROBBING WITH INTERNAL ROARING AS OF IMPRISONED GASES NOW IT SEEMED FURIOUS
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED BUILDINGS IN THE TOWN AND THE SURROUNDING VALLEY BEING INJURED THOUGH NONE OF THEM WERE DESTROYED THE EARTHQUAKE AT OTHER CITIES
ABOVE ITS APEX THERE APPEARED A GREAT BLACK CLOUD WHICH REACHED HIGH IN THE AIR
OF THE VILLAGES IN THE VICINITY OF SAINT PIERRE ONLY ONE ESCAPED THE OTHERS SUFFERING THE FATE OF THE CITY THE FORTUNATE ONE WAS LE CARBET ON THE SOUTH WHICH ESCAPED UNINJURED THE FLOOD OF LAVA STOPPING WHEN WITHIN TWO HUNDRED FEET OF THE TOWN
A DISASTER DIFFERENT IN KIND AND CAUSE OCCURRED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN A TERRIBLE TROPICAL STORM BURST UPON THE MOUNTAIN THE FLOODS OF RAIN SWEPT FROM ITS SIDES THE LOOSE VOLCANIC MATERIAL
THE LAKE WHICH BURNETH WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE THE EVERLASTING BURNINGS THE FIERY SEA WHOSE WAVES ARE NEVER WEARY PERHAPS THOSE SCRIPTURE PHRASES WERE SUGGESTED BY THE SIGHT OF SOME VOLCANO IN ERUPTION THERE WERE GROANINGS RUMBLINGS AND DETONATIONS
THEY FINALLY MET IN THE NORTH END POLICE STATION ON SACRAMENTO STREET AND THERE ENTERED ACTIVELY UPON THEIR DUTIES OF SEEKING TO CHECK THE PROGRESS OF THE FLAMES MAINTAIN ORDER IN THE CITY AND CONTROL AND DIRECT THE HOST OF FUGITIVES
ONE OF THE RIVERS BECAME MUDDY AND ITS WATERS GREW HOT IN OCTOBER WITHOUT ANY WARNING A MOST TERRIFIC ERUPTION OCCURRED
THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SUN THAT AFTERNOON
THE IMMENSE PRESSURE CAUSING IT TO SPOUT IN GREAT FLASHING FOUNTAINS HIGH INTO THE AIR IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO THE FIERY FOUNTAINS REACHED A HEIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED FEET IN SOME LATER ERUPTIONS THEY HAVE LEAPED ONE THOUSAND FEET HIGH
THE CHARGE HAD TO BE PLACED SO SWIFTLY AND THE FUSE LIT IN SUCH A HURRY THAT THE EXPLOSION WAS NOT QUITE SUCCESSFUL FROM THE TRAINED VIEWPOINT OF THE GUNNERS BUT THOUGH THE WALLS STILL STOOD
MAJESTY MYSTERY AND EVEN BEAUTY AND THE COLOR EYE HATH NOT SEEN IT MOLTEN METAL HATH NOT THAT CRIMSON GLEAM NOR BLOOD THAT LIVING LIGHT
EMBRACING ONE OF THE BEST SECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA LAYING WASTE NOT ONLY THE TOWNS IN ITS PATH BUT DOING MUCH DAMAGE TO RANCH HOUSES AND COUNTRY RESIDENCES
I NOTICED A SORT OF GRIT THAT GOT INTO MY MOUTH FROM THE END OF THE CIGAR I WAS SMOKING
ALTHOUGH THEIR HEIGHT IS SO VAST THE ASCENT TO THEIR SUMMITS IS SO GRADUAL THAT THEIR CIRCUMFERENCE AT THE BASE IS ENORMOUS
WHAT COULD BE DONE TO STAY THE FIERCE MARCH OF THE FLAMES WHICH WERE SWEEPING RESISTLESSLY OVER PALACE AND HOVEL ALIKE OVER STATELY HALL AND MISERABLE HUT WATER WAS NOT TO BE HAD WHAT WAS TO TAKE ITS PLACE
WELL SIR AT THAT MINUTE THERE BEGAN THE MOST EXCITING TIME I'VE EVER BEEN THROUGH AND I'VE BEEN ON EVERY SEA ON THE MAP FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS EVERY SECOND THERE'D BE WAVES FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FEET HIGH BELTING US HEAD ON STERN ON AND BROADSIDE ALL AT ONCE WE COULD SEE THEM COMING
WHILE HE WAS IN THE BUILDING THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AND HE RECEIVED INJURIES THAT SEEMED LIKELY TO PROVE FATAL HIS SKULL BEING FRACTURED AND SEVERAL BONES BROKEN WHILE HE WAS INJURED INTERNALLY
AND THE RESOLUTION TO DESTROY THEM WAS THE LAST RESORT OF DESPERATION HUNDREDS OF POLICE REGIMENTS OF SOLDIERS AND SCORES OF VOLUNTEERS WERE SENT INTO THE DOOMED DISTRICT TO WARN THE PEOPLE TO FLEE
BUT ITS GREATEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE ERUPTION TOOK PLACE IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE THE YEAR OF THE GREAT ERUPTION OF THE SAINT VINCENT VOLCANO ON THIS FATAL OCCASION SEVERAL TOWNS WERE DESTROYED AND NO LESS THAN TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES
THE HOT SPRINGS IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES AND THE EARTHQUAKES WHICH OCCASIONALLY BRING DEATH AND DESTRUCTION OF THE MANY OF THESE ON RECORD THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE WAS IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE WHEN FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND TWO THOUSAND INJURED WHILE MANY BUILDINGS WERE WRECKED
ON THE ADJOINING ISLAND OF MAUI IS A STILL LARGER VOLCANO THE MIGHTY HALEAKALA LONG SINCE EXTINCT BUT MEMORABLE AS POSSESSING THE MOST STUPENDOUS CRATER ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
THE MEMORIAL CHURCH WITH ITS TWELVE MARBLE FIGURES OF THE APOSTLES EACH WEIGHING TWO TONS WAS BADLY INJURED BY THE FALL OF ITS GOTHIC SPIRE WHICH CRASHED THROUGH THE ROOF AND DEMOLISHED MUCH OF THE INTERIOR
I HAD ALL HANDS PIPED ON DECK AND WE BATTENED DOWN EVERYTHING LOOSE TO MAKE READY FOR A STORM
THEN IT FORCED A PASSAGE THROUGH A SUBTERRANEAN CAVITY TWENTY SEVEN MILES LONG AND REACHED THE SEA FORTY MILES DISTANT IN TWO DAYS
THE MONEY LOSS AT THIS SMALL CITY IS ESTIMATED AT THREE MILLION DOLLARS THE DESTRUCTION OF SANTA ROSA GAVE RISE TO GENERAL SORROW AMONG THE RESIDENTS OF THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE HORACE THE BRITISH STEAMER HORACE EXPERIENCED THE EFFECT OF THE EXPLOSION WHEN FARTHER FROM LAND
THE PEAKS NAMED ARE THE MOST APPARENT REMNANTS OF A WORLD RENDING VOLCANIC ACTIVITY IN THE REMOTE PAST BY WHOSE FORCE THIS WHOLE HAWAIIAN ISLAND GROUP WAS LIFTED UP FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEAN HERE DESCENDING SOME THREE AND A HALF MILES BELOW THE SURFACE LEVEL
RUSHINGS HISSINGS SPLASHINGS AND THE CRASHING SOUND OF BREAKERS ON THE COAST BUT IT WAS THE SURGING OF FIERY WAVES UPON A FIERY SHORE BUT WHAT CAN I WRITE SUCH WORDS AS JETS FOUNTAINS WAVES SPRAY CONVEY SOME IDEA OF ORDER AND REGULARITY
THE HORIZON MURKY WITH VAPORS AND GLEAMING WITH THE REFLECTED CONTEST SUCH WAS THE SCENE AS THE FIERY CATARACT LEAPING A PRECIPICE OF FIFTY FEET POURED ITS FLOOD UPON THE OCEAN
IN THE CENTRAL REGION OF THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN LIES THE ARCHIPELAGO FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE SANDWICH ISLANDS NOW COLLECTIVELY DESIGNATED AS HAWAII
THE OLD LINE OF COAST A MASS OF COMPACT INDURATED LAVA WHITENED CRACKED AND FELL
IN THE RESIDENTIAL PORTION OF THE CITY THE FOUNDATIONS RECEDED FROM UNDER THE HOUSES BADLY WRECKING ABOUT TWENTY OF THE LARGEST AND DAMAGING EVERY ONE MORE OR LESS AND HERE AS IN SAN FRANCISCO FLAMES FOLLOWED THE EARTHQUAKE
IT WAS DEAFENING AND THE FLASH OF LIGHT THAT ACCOMPANIED IT WAS BLINDING MORE SO THAN ANY LIGHTNING I HAVE EVER SEEN IT WAS LIKE A TERRIBLE HURRICANE AND WHERE A FRACTION OF A SECOND BEFORE THERE HAD BEEN A PERFECT CALM
AND THOSE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE AND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO WHEN MOUNT MERAPI A VERY ACTIVE VOLCANO COVERED A GREAT EXTENT OF COUNTRY WITH STONES AND ASHES AND RUINED THE COFFEE PLANTATIONS OF THE NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS
CAREFUL INSPECTION SHOWED THAT THE FIERY STREAM WHICH SO COMPLETELY DESTROYED SAINT PIERRE MUST HAVE BEEN COMPOSED OF POISONOUS GASES
WHICH AT ORDINARY TIMES ARE FOUND IN GREAT NUMBERS NEAR THE VOLCANO CRAWLED AWAY BIRDS CEASED SINGING AND LEFT THE TREES THAT SHADED THE SIDES OF PELEE
AN EYE WITNESS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY FLOW THUS DESCRIBES IT
AND HAD MADE ITSELF FELT FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE PACIFIC WESTWARD WRECKING THE LARGER BUILDINGS OF EVERY TOWN IN ITS PATH RENDING AND RUINING AS IT WENT AND DOING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE
THE WHOLE SECTION OF THE SKY IN THAT DIRECTION SEEMED DARK AND TROUBLED ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK FRIDAY MORNING I WAS SITTING ON ONE OF THE HATCHES AFT WITH SOME OF THE OTHER ENGINEERS AND OFFICERS OF THE SHIP DISCUSSING THE PECULIAR WEATHER PHENOMENA
OF WHICH COTTABATO WAS IN ERUPTION IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND IS STILL ACTIVE AT INTERVALS APO THE LARGEST OF THE THREE ESTIMATED TO BE TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWELVE FEET HIGH HAS THREE SUMMITS WITHIN WHICH LIES THE GREAT CRATER NOW EXTINCT AND FILLED WITH WATER
THAT DID NOT LOSE A CHIMNEY OR FEEL A TREMOR THAT SPOT IS ALCATRAZ ISLAND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ISLAND IS COVERED WITH BRICK BUILDINGS BRICK FORTS AND BRICK CHIMNEYS NOT A BRICK WAS LOOSENED NOR A CRACK MADE NOR A QUIVER FELT
SO I SUPPOSED AT FIRST WHEN THE FIRE STRUCK US THAT HE WAS ASLEEP IN HIS BUNK AND SAFE BUT HE WASN'T NOBODY COULD TELL ME WHERE HE WAS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE WAS BURNED TO DEATH OR ROLLED OVERBOARD AND DROWNED
A DESCRIPTION OF THOSE OF THE ISLAND OF LUZON WHICH ARE THE MOST ACTIVE IN THE ARCHIPELAGO IS HERE SUB JOINED THE LUZON VOLCANOES
THIS INDICATING A LIFT AND FALL OF THE OCEAN BED OFF THE ISLE
TO THIS DESCRIPTION WE MAY ADD THAT OF MISTER ELLIS A FORMER MISSIONARY TO THESE ISLANDS AND ONE OF THE NUMBER WHO HAVE DESCENDED TO THE SHORES OF KILAUEA'S ABYSS OF FIRE
AND BEING PUT OUT OF SERVICE UNTIL REPAIRED IN FACT THE RUINOUS EFFECTS OF THE EARTHQUAKE IMMENSELY EXCEEDED THOSE OF ANY SIMILAR CATASTROPHE EVER BEFORE KNOWN IN THE UNITED STATES
VOLCANOES IN THE SOUTHERN ISLANDS EXTINCT VOLCANOES ARE NUMEROUS IN LUZON AND THERE ARE SMOKING CONES IN THE NORTH AND ALSO IN THE BABUYANES ISLANDS STILL FARTHER NORTH VOLCANOES ALSO EXIST IN SEVERAL OF THE OTHER ISLANDS
ERUPTION OF GALUNG GUNG A SPACE OF TWENTY FOUR MILES BETWEEN THE MOUNTAIN AND A RIVER FORTY MILES DISTANT WAS COVERED TO SUCH A DEPTH WITH BLUE MUD THAT PEOPLE WERE BURIED IN THEIR HOUSES AND NOT A TRACE OF THE NUMEROUS VILLAGES AND PLANTATIONS WAS VISIBLE
BUT EXTENDED AS FAR NORTH AS PORTO RICO AND IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE SEISMIC WAVE WOULD BE FOUND TO HAVE ALTERED THE OCEAN BED ROUND JAMAICA
NOT A SINGLE BRICK OR STONE BUILDING OF TWO STORIES OR OVER WAS LEFT STANDING AMONG THOSE WRECKED WERE THE HALL OF JUSTICE JUST COMPLETED AT A COST OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THE NEW HIGH SCHOOL
THE SIDES OF THE GULF BEFORE US ALTHOUGH COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT STRATA OF ANCIENT LAVA WERE PERPENDICULAR FOR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FEET AND ROSE FROM A WIDE HORIZONTAL LEDGE OF SOLID BLACK LAVA OF IRREGULAR BREADTH BUT EXTENDING COMPLETELY ROUND
IMAGINE NIAGARA'S STREAM ABOVE THE BRINK OF THE FALLS WITH ITS DASHING WHIRLING MADLY RAGING WATERS HURRYING ON TO THEIR PLUNGE INSTANTANEOUSLY CONVERTED INTO FIRE A GORY HUED RIVER OF FUSED MINERALS VOLUMES OF HISSING STEAM ARISING
SHE WAS A JEALOUS AND VINDICTIVE MONSTER DELIGHTING IN CRUELTY AND AT THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION OVERWHELMING THE UNOFFENDING VICTIMS OF HER RAGE IN WIDESPREAD RUIN
WE ALL REMARKED IN THE ENGINE ROOM THAT THERE MUST BE A HEAVY STORM APPROACHING SEVERAL OF THE SAILORS EXPERIENCED DEEP WATER SEAMEN
DURING THE SUCCEEDING WEEK SEVERAL OTHER SHOCKS OF SOME STRENGTH WERE REPORTED FROM THIS TOWN THUS THE RUINOUS WORK OF THE EARTHQUAKE STRETCHED OVER A BROAD TRACK OF PROSPEROUS PEACEFUL AND HAPPY COUNTRY
THE TERRIFIC POWER OF THE EXPLOSIVE WAS EQUAL TO THE MANIAC DETERMINATION OF THE FIRE CAPTAIN MAC BRIDE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE SQUAD CHIEF GUNNER ADAMSON PLACED THE CHARGES AND THE THIRD GUNNER SET THEM OFF
ABOUT THIRTY MILES SOUTH OF SAN FRANCISCO FELT THE FULL FORCE OF THE EARTHQUAKE AND WAS BADLY WRECKED ONLY TWO LIVES WERE LOST AS A RESULT OF THE EARTHQUAKE ONE OF A STUDENT THE OTHER OF A FIREMAN
WITH THE DAWN THE SHOCKS AND NOISES CEASED AND REVEALED THE CHANGES WHICH KILAUEA HAD UNDERGONE IN THE NIGHT ALL THE HIGH CLIFFS SURROUNDING HALEMAUMAU AND NEW LAKE WHICH HAD BECOME A PROMINENT FEATURE IN THE CRATER HAD VANISHED ENTIRELY
KILAUEA IN EIGHTEEN FORTY KILAUEA SEEMS NEVER IN HISTORIC TIMES TO HAVE FILLED AND OVERFLOWED ITS VAST CRATER TO DO SO WOULD NEED AN ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE VOLUME OF LIQUID ROCK MATERIAL
FORT BRAGG ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL LUMBERING TOWNS IN MENDOCINO COUNTY WAS PRACTICALLY WIPED OUT BY FIRE FOLLOWING THE EARTHQUAKE BUT OUT OF A POPULATION OF FIVE THOUSAND ONLY ONE WAS KILLED THOUGH SCORES WERE INJURED
HAD ALL BEEN LIKE THESE THE ENTIRE CITY WOULD HAVE BEEN DOOMED BUT THERE WERE THOSE AT THE HEAD OF AFFAIRS WHO NEVER FOR A MOMENT GAVE UP THEIR RESOLUTION
AT LOMA PRIETA THE EARTHQUAKE CAUSED A MINE HOUSE TO SLIP DOWN THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN TEN MEN BEING BURIED IN THE RUINS
IN THE EARLY MORNING WHEN THE FIRE REACHED THE MUNICIPAL BUILDING ON PORTSMOUTH SQUARE THE NURSES WITH THE AID OF SOLDIERS GOT OUT FIFTY BODIES WHICH WERE IN THE TEMPORARY MORGUE AND A NUMBER OF PATIENTS FROM THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL
JUST AS THE STORM OF SAND WAS AT ITS HEIGHT FOURTH ENGINEER WILD WAS NEARLY SUFFOCATED BY IT BUT WAS EASILY REVIVED
AND FAITH IN PELE'S POWER WAS WIDELY SHAKEN
THESE CONVULSIONS OF THE EARTH AFFECT THE FORM AND ELEVATION OF BUILDINGS WHICH ARE RARELY MORE THAN TWO STORIES HIGH AND LIGHTLY BUILT WHILE TRANSLUCENT SEA SHELLS REPLACE GLASS IN THEIR WINDOWS
HE LED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHAMBERS OF A HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONTAIN TO HER EYES
I HAVE
NOW WHICH WAY COULD THEY WEND ALL WAS RAYLESS TO THEM A MAZE WITHOUT A CLUE WEARIED DESPONDENT BEWILDERED THEY HOWEVER PASSED ALONG THE ASHES FALLING UPON THEIR HEADS
OUR RITES REQUIRE SUCH HOLY GROUND THEY PASSED INTO A NARROW HALL AT THE END OF WHICH HUNG A SABLE CURTAIN ARBACES LIFTED IT IONE ENTERED AND FOUND HERSELF IN TOTAL DARKNESS
THOU HAST PILES OF GOLD OF VASES AND OF JEWELS WHICH MIGHT RIVAL THE RECEPTACLES OF THE WEALTH OF THE DEIFIED NERO
HE HAD EASILY THEREFORE LULLED ANY SCRUPLE OF CONSCIENCE WHICH MIGHT HAVE LED HER TO EXTENUATE THE OFFENCE OF GLAUCUS BY AVOWING HER SHARE IN HIS FRENZY AND THE MORE READILY FOR HER VAIN HEART HAD LOVED THE FAME AND THE PROSPERITY OF GLAUCUS
BEHOLD THE LORD DESCENDETH TO JUDGMENT HE MAKETH FIRE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IN THE SIGHT OF MEN
AH HE MUTTERED AS HE GLARED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WHAT FURY HATH SENT YE HITHER ATE
WHITHER WENDEST THOU I SHALL CROSS OVER TO HERCULANEUM THIS DAY AND WANDERING THENCE ALONG THE COAST SHALL SEEK OUT A NEW HOME I AM FRIENDLESS MY TWO COMPANIONS
POWER LUXURY SHALL BE THY SLAVES ARBACES SHALL HAVE NO AMBITION SAVE THE PRIDE OF OBEYING THEE IONE TURN UPON ME THOSE EYES SHED UPON ME THY SMILE DARK IS MY SOUL WHEN THY FACE IS HID FROM IT
WAIT HERE PATIENTLY FOR SOME DAYS AND GLAUCUS SHALL BE RESTORED SO SAYING AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR HER REPLY HE HASTENED FROM THE ROOM DREW THE BOLT ACROSS THE DOOR AND CONSIGNED THE CARE AND WANTS OF HIS PRISONER
OVER HIS TUNIC FLOWED A LOOSE EASTERN ROBE HALF GOWN HALF MANTLE GLOWING IN THE RICHEST HUES OF THE TYRIAN DYE
SHINE OVER ME MY SUN MY HEAVEN MY DAYLIGHT IONE IONE DO NOT REJECT MY LOVE ALONE AND IN THE POWER OF THIS SINGULAR AND FEARFUL MAN
SO GREAT ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS WAS THE CONCOURSE OF STRANGERS FROM ALL PARTS OF CAMPANIA
THEY ROCKED TO AND FRO THEY SWAYED FROM END TO END OF THEIR CONFINED ARENA
COULD DISTORT THAN OF THE WOE WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT UPON HER
SOME WERE VIVID WITH EXPECTATION AND HOPE SOME UNUTTERABLY DEJECTED BY AWE AND HORROR AND SO THEY PASSED SWIFT AND CONSTANTLY ON TILL THE EYES OF THE GAZER GREW DIZZY AND BLINDED
WILT THOU NOT WAIT THE MORROW WHY THIS DELAY
AS IF TO INVITE HER TO ASCEND IT THE NEAPOLITAN'S HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY SHALL THE SHADOW DISCLOSE ITSELF WHISPERED A VOICE BESIDE HER THE VOICE OF ARBACES
BEAR AWAY WITH THEE THIS NIGHT AS MUCH AS THOU CANST CONCEAL BENEATH THY ROBES NAY WHEN THOU HAST ONCE SEEN WHAT THY FRIEND POSSESSES
I DREAMT NOT THAT THERE LIVED ONE OUT OF THE PRIESTHOOD OF ISIS WHO WOULD HAVE SAVED ARBACES FROM DESTRUCTION THE SIGNS THOU HAST SEEN IN THE BED OF THE EXTINCT VOLCANO CONTINUED THE EGYPTIAN MUSINGLY
ATHWART WHOSE ETERNAL DARKNESS NO BEAM OF DAY HAD EVER GLANCED AND IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THESE COLUMNS WERE HUGE WHEELS THAT WHIRLED ROUND AND ROUND UNCEASINGLY AND WITH A RUSHING AND ROARING NOISE
HAST THOU TOLD LIVING EAR WHAT THOU DIDST WITNESS NO MY MASTER THE SECRET IS LOCKED IN THY SERVANT'S BREAST WHAT EVEN THY KINSMAN BURBO GUESSES IT NOT COME THE TRUTH BY THE GODS
ON WHICH STOOD A TRIPOD OF BRONZE
IN THE MEASURELESS ASCENT HE TURNED IN FEAR TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE EXTREMITY AND BEHOLD THERE CAME SWIFTLY FROM THE GLOOM ABOVE SIMILAR SHADOWS WHICH SWEPT HURRIEDLY ALONG THE GALLERY TO THE RIGHT
BEATING ABOUT AS IT WERE FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMUNICATE THE SECRET WHICH WEIGHED UPON HIM
TO DEFY THE PRYING EYES OF CURIOSITY OR OBSERVATION A TABLE ON WHICH LAY A SCROLL FILLED WITH MYSTIC FIGURES WAS BEFORE HIM ON HIGH THE STARS WAXED DIM AND FAINT
THE CITY SEEMED AS AFTER THE AWFUL CHANGE OF SEVENTEEN AGES IT SEEMS NOW TO THE TRAVELER A CITY OF THE DEAD THE OCEAN ITSELF THAT SERENE AND TIDELESS SEA
LET ME LOOK AGAIN BEWARE SAY THE SHINING PROPHETS HOW THOU PASSEST UNDER ANCIENT ROOFS OR BESIEGED WALLS
GIVES ME THE POSSESSION OF MY BRIDE
ARBACES CAME NEARER TO HER HIS BREATH GLOWED FIERCELY ON HER CHEEK HE WOUND HIS ARMS ROUND HER SHE SPRANG FROM HIS EMBRACE IN THE STRUGGLE A TABLET FELL FROM HER BOSOM ON THE GROUND
WHICH YET MORE AND MORE WITH EVERY HOUR OBSTRUCTED THE WAY AND AS THE DAY ADVANCED THE MOTION OF THE EARTH WAS MORE SENSIBLY FELT THE FOOTING SEEMED TO SLIDE AND CREEP NOR COULD CHARIOT OR LITTER BE KEPT STEADY EVEN ON THE MOST LEVEL GROUND
THE FRAGMENTARY STONES DASHING UP IN SPARKLES BEFORE THEIR FEET ALAS ALAS MURMURED IONE I CAN GO NO FARTHER MY STEPS SINK AMONG THE SCORCHING CINDERS FLY DEAREST
RETURNED THE PRIEST GRINNING WITTIER AND MORE WITTY BUT SPEAK OUT WHAT SHALL BE THE SUM ARBACES I HAVE HEARD THAT IN THY SECRET TREASURY BELOW BENEATH THOSE RUDE OSCAN ARCHES WHICH PROP THY STATELY HALLS
AT LENGTH SHE DISCOVERED PLAINLY TREES AND RIVERS AND MEADOWS
THAN THE CLOSE AND BLIND DARKNESS OF SOME NARROW ROOM BUT IN PROPORTION AS THE BLACKNESS GATHERED DID THE LIGHTNINGS AROUND VESUVIUS INCREASE IN THEIR VIVID AND SCORCHING GLARE
AGAIN DO THE STARS FOREWARN ME SOME DANGER THEN ASSUREDLY AWAITS ME SAID HE SLOWLY SOME DANGER VIOLENT AND SUDDEN IN ITS NATURE
LOSING ALL THE VULGAR AUDACITY OF HIS NATURAL CHARACTER VERILY THOU ART A MAGICIAN THOU READEST THE HEART AS IT WERE A SCROLL IT IS MY VOCATION ANSWERED THE EGYPTIAN LAUGHING GENTLY WELL THEN FORBEAR
AND SHE SOON GAINED THE BROAD PORCH OF THE EGYPTIAN'S PALACE THE BLACK PORTER LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD ASTIR AT AN UNUSUAL HOUR STARTED AS HE OPENED THE DOOR TO HER SUMMONS
RODE THE CLOUD CAPPED SUMMIT OF THE DREAD MOUNTAIN WITH THE SHADOWS NOW DARK NOW LIGHT BETRAYING THE MOSSY CAVERNS AND ASHY ROCKS WHICH TESTIFIED THE PAST CONFLAGRATIONS AND MIGHT HAVE PROPHESIED
THE FEROCITY OF THE PEOPLE THE ARENA AND THE LION'S DEN SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE THOUGHT OF GLAUCUS EVERYTHING THAT WAS PROSPEROUS AND LOFTY SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE THAT ANY PERIL SAVE FROM THE MADNESS OF HER LOVE
NOT TILL HE HAD HEARD HER LOUD DENUNCIATIONS WAS HE AWARE THAT HE HAD ALSO ANOTHER DANGER TO APPREHEND
HE BORE HER TO THE REMOTER AND MORE SHELTERED PART OF THE PORTICO
AND THE LONG FAMILY OF ARBACES WERE ALREADY ARRANGED IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE LITTER OF THEIR LORD ONLY TO THEIR GREAT CHAGRIN THE SLAVES IN ATTENDANCE ON IONE
TO ADD TO THIS PARTIAL RELIEF OF THE DARKNESS THE CITIZENS HAD HERE AND THERE IN THE MORE PUBLIC PLACES SUCH AS THE PORTICOES OF TEMPLES AND THE ENTRANCES TO THE FORUM ENDEAVORED TO PLACE ROWS OF TORCHES
HIS KNEES KNOCKED TOGETHER HE STOOD SEIZED WITH A DIVINE PANIC DISMAYED AGHAST HALF UNMANNED BEFORE HIS FOE
AS THROUGH A TRANSPARENT VEIL FLUSHED LUMINOUSLY A CRIMSON AND BURNING HUE
OF GEMS WHICH THE EGYPTIAN
WERE CONDEMNED TO REMAIN AT HOME CALLIAS SAID ARBACES APART TO HIS FREEDMAN WHO WAS BUCKLING ON HIS GIRDLE I AM WEARY OF POMPEII I PROPOSE TO QUIT IT IN THREE DAYS SHOULD THE WIND FAVOR
AND NOW LEAPED FIERCELY TO AND FRO DARTING ACROSS THE VAST GLOOM IN WILD GAMBOLS SUDDENLY DISAPPEARING AND AS SUDDENLY BURSTING INTO TENFOLD BRILLIANCY AND POWER
NOR I A DESIRE TO STINT THY REWARD THOU SHALT DESCEND WITH ME TO THAT TREASURY THOU REFERREST TO THOU SHALT FEAST THINE EYES WITH THE BLAZE OF UNCOUNTED GOLD AND THE SPARKLE OF PRICELESS GEMS AND THOU SHALT FOR THY OWN REWARD
HE HOWEVER
WAS A COLOSSAL HEAD OF THE BLACKEST MARBLE WHICH SHE PERCEIVED BY THE CROWN OF WHEAT EARS THAT ENCIRCLED THE BROW REPRESENTED THE GREAT EGYPTIAN GODDESS ARBACES STOOD BEFORE THE ALTAR
WHY IN THOSE PHLEGRAE NOW LAUGHING WITH THE VINE
AND THE GLITTERING EYES FIERCE WITH A SAVAGE GLADNESS HALF PROPHET AND HALF FIEND
ARE EVER TWO IMPALPABLE AND SPIRITUAL HOSTS
AND THOU ART DESTINED TO BE THE BRIDE OF ARBACES
THE SOFTNESS OF HIS VOICE REASSURED HER AND IN HER OWN PURITY SHE FELT PROTECTION BUT SHE WAS CONFUSED ASTONISHED
DO WITH ME AS THOU WILT SAY THAT THOU LOVEST NOT ME BUT SAY NOT THAT THOU LOVEST ANOTHER ALAS BEGAN IONE AND THEN APPALLED BEFORE HIS SUDDEN AND UNLOOKED FOR VIOLENCE
THE ALTAR ROCKED THE TRIPOD REELED
ARBACES PERCEIVED AND SEIZED IT IT WAS THE LETTER THAT MORNING RECEIVED FROM GLAUCUS IONE SANK UPON THE COUCH HALF DEAD WITH TERROR
IT IS WELL TO CHARGE HIM WITH THAT CRIME BUT THOU OF ALL MEN KNOWEST THAT HE IS INNOCENT EXPLAIN THYSELF SAID ARBACES COLDLY FOR HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF FOR THE HINT HIS SECRET FEARS HAD FORETOLD ARBACES
AND INSPIRED BY LOVE WOULD BE ONLY ANXIOUS AT ANY EXPENSE OF SHAME TO RETRIEVE HER ERROR AND PRESERVE HER BELOVED BESIDES HOW UNWORTHY OF THE RANK AND REPUTE OF ARBACES
BEFORE WHICH SUNK INTO SUDDEN IMPOTENCE HIS PASSION AND HIS ARTS IT WOKE IT STIRRED THAT DREAD DEMON OF THE EARTHQUAKE
WILT THOU PROVE MY KNOWLEDGE IONE AND BEHOLD THE REPRESENTATION OF THINE OWN FATE
THE MUSIC SANK INTO A LOW AND SUBDUED STRAIN AND ARBACES THUS ADDRESSED HIS BEAUTIFUL GUEST HAST THOU NEVER IN THIS DARK AND UNCERTAIN WORLD HAST THOU NEVER ASPIRED MY PUPIL TO LOOK BEYOND
THE DARKNESS WAS NOW TERRIBLY RELIEVED FOR SEVERAL HOUSES AND EVEN VINEYARDS HAD BEEN SET ON FLAMES AND AT VARIOUS INTERVALS THE FIRES ROSE SUDDENLY AND FIERCELY AGAINST THE SOLID GLOOM
SOMETIMES THE HUGER STONES STRIKING AGAINST EACH OTHER AS THEY FELL BROKE INTO COUNTLESS FRAGMENTS EMITTING SPARKS OF FIRE WHICH CAUGHT WHATEVER WAS COMBUSTIBLE WITHIN THEIR REACH AND ALONG THE PLAINS BEYOND THE CITY
AND STOOPING EVER AND ANON AS IF TO PLUCK ITS RANK PRODUCE HO SAID HE ALOUD I HAVE THEN ANOTHER COMPANION IN THESE UNWORLDLY NIGHT WATCHES
FILLED UP THE INTERSTICES OF THE COLUMNS THE MOST PRECIOUS WOODS LINED THE THRESHOLDS AND COMPOSED THE DOORS
AND THE STREAM ITSELF WAS BROADER FIERCER REDDER THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE THEN I WENT FORTH AND ASCENDED TO THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCK AND IN THAT SUMMIT
NOW OF A LIVID AND SNAKELIKE GREEN DARTING RESTLESSLY TO AND FRO AS THE FOLDS OF AN ENORMOUS SERPENT
THE MUSCLES STRAINED THE VEINS SWELLED THE LIPS APART THE TEETH SET BOTH WERE STRONG BEYOND THE ORDINARY POWER OF MEN BOTH ANIMATED BY RELENTLESS WRATH THEY COILED THEY WOUND AROUND EACH OTHER
TILL HE STOOD BEFORE HER FACE TO FACE THE COUNTENANCE OF THE GIANTESS WAS SOLEMN AND HUSHED AND BEAUTIFULLY SERENE IT WAS AS THE FACE OF SOME COLOSSAL SCULPTURE OF HIS OWN ANCESTRAL SPHINX NO PASSION
SUDDENLY FROM THAT TRIPOD LEAPED INTO LIFE A BLUE QUICK DARTING
THAN THE CRIME OF WHICH SHE HAD VAGUELY HEARD HIM ACCUSED OR THE CHANCES OF THE IMPENDING TRIAL POOR WRETCH THAT SHE WAS WHOM NONE ADDRESSED NONE CARED FOR WHAT DID SHE KNOW OF THE SENATE AND THE SENTENCE THE HAZARD OF THE LAW
THE UNSUBSTANTIAL VAPORS WERE AS THE BODILY FORMS OF GIGANTIC FOES THE AGENTS OF TERROR AND OF DEATH THE ASHES IN MANY PLACES WERE ALREADY KNEE DEEP AND THE BOILING SHOWERS WHICH CAME FROM THE STEAMING BREATH OF THE VOLCANO
FROM THE GATE STRETCHED THE LONG STREET OF TOMBS VARIOUS IN SIZE AND ARCHITECTURE BY WHICH ON THAT SIDE THE CITY IS AS YET APPROACHED ABOVE ALL
SAID ARBACES SINKING HIS VOICE INTO A WHISPER THOU SHALT GO TO THY TOMB RATHER THAN TO HIS ARMS WHAT THINKEST THOU ARBACES WILL BROOK A RIVAL SUCH AS THIS PUNY GREEK WHAT
THEN IS MY WISDOM VAIN GROANED THE DREAMER
WHOSE FESTIVE AND GLITTERING GARMENTS CONTRASTED IN MOCKERY THE SOLEMN TERROR OF THE HOUR THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO HEED THE STRANGERS
WE SEE THE ONE AS THE OTHER AND LEARN AS I HAVE LEARNED NOT ALONE THE MYSTERIES OF THE DEAD BUT ALSO THE DESTINY OF THE LIVING AS THOU HAST LEARNED CAN WISDOM ATTAIN SO FAR
WHEN GLAUCUS IS NO MORE THOU SHALT PAY THE TREASURY ANOTHER VISIT SPEAK I FRANKLY AND AS A FRIEND
AND A SUBLIME AND UNEARTHLY EMOTION HAD NOT INDEED QUELLED THEIR AWE BUT IT HAD ROBBED AWE OF FEAR THEY HAD LONG BELIEVED ACCORDING TO THE ERROR OF THE EARLY CHRISTIANS THAT THE LAST DAY WAS AT HAND
THE CURTAINS WITHDREW AS BY MAGIC HANDS
THE WATCHFUL EGYPTIAN CAUGHT HIS ARM AS IT DESCENDED
TO THE SLAVE WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF THAT PART OF THE MANSION ALONE THEN AND MUSINGLY HE WAITED THE MORNING LIGHT AND WITH IT REPAIRED
AND WHEREFORE WERT THOU HID BEHIND THE CHAPEL AT THAT HOUR
WHEN HE JUDGED HER MERELY THE ACCOMPLICE OF JULIA IN OBTAINING THE PHILTRE HE HAD FELT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO THE FULL SUCCESS OF HIS VENGEANCE TO ALLOW HER TO BE AT LARGE TO APPEAR PERHAPS AS A WITNESS
AS IF BORNE INVOLUNTARILY ADOWN THE SIDES OF SOME INVISIBLE STREAM AND THE FACES OF THESE SPECTRES WERE MORE DISTINCT THAN THOSE THAT EMERGED FROM THE OPPOSITE PASSAGE AND ON SOME WAS JOY AND ON OTHERS SORROW
SLEEPLESS AND ALONE ON THE SUMMIT OF THE LOFTY AND PYRAMIDAL TOWER WHICH FLANKED HIS HOUSE A TALL PARAPET AROUND IT SERVED AS A WALL AND CONSPIRED
WOE TO YE OF THE FASCES AND THE PURPLE WOE TO THE IDOLATER AND THE WORSHIPPER OF THE BEAST WOE TO YE WHO POUR FORTH THE BLOOD OF SAINTS AND GLOAT OVER THE DEATH PANGS OF THE SONS OF GOD WOE TO THE HARLOT OF THE SEA
THOU HAST HAD COUNTLESS WEALTH A FRAME ON WHOSE CLOSE WOVEN FIBRES DISEASE CAN FIND NO SPACE TO ENTER PROSPEROUS LOVE INEXHAUSTIBLE PLEASURE AND EVEN AT THIS HOUR TRIUMPHANT REVENGE THOU ALLUDEST TO THE ATHENIAN
DESCEND AND SEE THAT THE SLAVES ARE MARSHALLED
AND THE FATES SO HARSH TO OTHERS WEAVE ONLY FOR THEE THE WEB OF HAPPINESS AND LOVE WILT THOU THEN COME AND BEHOLD THY DOOM SO THAT THOU MAYEST ENJOY IT BEFOREHAND
EACH EVENT TO COME HAS ALSO ITS SPECTRUM ITS SHADE WHEN THE HOUR ARRIVES LIFE ENTERS IT THE SHADOW BECOMES CORPOREAL AND WALKS THE WORLD THUS IN THE LAND BEYOND THE GRAVE
AS IF TO REGAIN HIS BREATH AND THENCE ONCE MORE DARTED UPON HIS PREY AT THAT INSTANT THE CURTAIN WAS RUDELY TORN ASIDE THE EGYPTIAN FELT A FIERCE AND STRONG GRASP UPON HIS SHOULDER
HER BLINDNESS RENDERED THE SCENE FAMILIAR TO HER ALONE ACCUSTOMED THROUGH A PERPETUAL NIGHT TO THREAD THE WINDINGS OF THE CITY SHE HAD LED THEM UNERRINGLY TOWARDS THE SEA SHORE BY WHICH THEY HAD RESOLVED TO HAZARD AN ESCAPE
AND THE WITCH AND THE MAGIAN THE PUPIL AND THE MASTER THE GREAT ONE AND THE ACCURSED ONE MAY MEET AGAIN FAREWELL OUT CROAKER
AT ANOTHER TIME THE EGYPTIAN MIGHT HAVE CONCEIVED A PHILOSOPHICAL INTEREST IN SOUNDING THE DEPTHS AND ORIGIN
OR THE DAY CANNOT COMPENSATE FOR THE PANGS OF NIGHT
BUT MAN IS BLIND THAT WHICH WAS TO COME DIFFICULT WAS IT THEN AND THERE TO GUESS THE CAUSES WHY THE TRADITION OF THE PLACE WORE SO GLOOMY AND STERN A HUE WHY IN THOSE SMILING PLAINS
VILLAS AND VILLAGES STRETCHED ON EVERY SIDE UP THE ASCENT OF VESUVIUS NOT NEARLY THEN SO STEEP OR SO LOFTY AS AT PRESENT FOR AS ROME ITSELF IS BUILT ON AN EXHAUSTED VOLCANO
I ENTERTAIN NO OTHER SENTIMENT OF ANIMOSITY AGAINST THAT UNFORTUNATE HOMICIDE HOMICIDE REPEATED CALENUS SLOWLY AND MEANINGLY AND HALTING AS HE SPOKE HE FIXED HIS EYES UPON ARBACES
SAVE THE PRIMAL LAW OF SELF PRESERVATION THROUGH THIS AWFUL SCENE DID THE ATHENIAN WADE HIS WAY ACCOMPANIED BY IONE AND THE BLIND GIRL SUDDENLY A RUSH OF HUNDREDS IN THEIR PATH TO THE SEA SWEPT BY THEM
BUT IT WAS NO LONGER HOME TO THE LITTLE PRINCESS CLOTILDA SHE THOUGHT OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND OF HER BROTHERS THE LITTLE PRINCES WITH WHOM SHE HAD PLAYED IN THIS VERY PALACE AS IT NOW SEEMED TO HER SO MANY YEARS AGO
THESE DIRT CLIFFS OR LOESS TO GIVE THEM THEIR SCIENTIFIC NAME ARE REMARKABLE BANKS OF BROWNISH YELLOW LOAM FOUND LARGELY IN NORTHERN AND WESTERN CHINA AND RISING SOMETIMES TO A HEIGHT OF A THOUSAND FEET
HOW THIS BOY KING CLOVIS SENDING A CHALLENGE TO COMBAT TO THE PREFECT SYAGRIUS THE LAST OF THE ROMAN GOVERNORS
AND WITH A SHRILL LAUGH OF DERISION SPRANG UP THE SHARP INCLINE AND DISAPPEARED IN ONE OF THE MANY CLIFF CAVES BEFORE THE NOW DOUBLY BAFFLED HORSEMEN COULD SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER WITH A GRUNT OF DISCOMFITURE AND DISGUST
YOU WHO PRATE SO LOUDLY WOULD BETTER PROVE YOUR WORDS BY SOME SIGN OF YOUR OWN VALOR YOU MAY HAVE DARED FIGHT YOUR LADY MOTHER WHO SO ROUNDLY PUNISHED YOU THEREFOR BUT A LION HATH NOT THE TENDER WAYS OF A WOMAN
AND OCCUPIED AMONG OTHER PLACES THE IMPORTANT TOWN OF GORKUM ON THE MAAS THE STOUT CITADEL OF THE TOWN WAS HOWEVER GARRISONED WITH LOYAL TROOPS THIS THE LORD OF ARKELL BESEIGED AND DEMANDING ITS SURRENDER
WAS FULL AS STRANGE AS ANY FOR CHINA
SEIZED THE LION BANNER OF HER HOUSE AND AT THE HEAD OF HER RESERVE TROOPS CHARGED THROUGH THE OPEN GATE STRAIGHT INTO THE RANKS OF HER VICTORIOUS FOES THERE WAS NEITHER MERCY NOR GENTLENESS IN HER HEART THEN AS WHEN SHE HAD COWED WITH A LOOK AJAX THE LION
IT WAS THE METROPOLIS OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE GREAT ROMAN EMPIRE AND DURING THIS PERIOD OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS ALL THE WEALTH AND TREASURE OF THE EAST POURED INTO CONSTANTINOPLE WHILE ALL THE GLORIES OF THE EMPIRE
TO JOIN IN THE FESTIVITIES AT COUNT WILLIAM'S COURT NOT ONE THAT APPROACHED HER FATHER IN NOBILITY OF BEARING OR MANLY STRENGTH NOT EVEN HER HUSBAND HER HUSBAND YES
SEVEN TIMES DID THE KNIGHTS OF JACQUELINE GLITTERING IN THEIR STEEL ARMOR CLASH INTO THE REBEL RANKS SEVEN TIMES WERE THEY DRIVEN BACK UNTIL AT LAST THE LORD OF ARKELL WITH A FIERY CHARGE FORCED THEM AGAINST THE VERY GATES OF THE CITADEL
WAS REARED IN THE SCHOOL OF SO CALLED CHIVALRY AND ROMANCE WHICH IN HER TIME WAS FAST APPROACHING ITS END SHE WAS INDEED AS ONE HISTORIAN DECLARES THE LAST HEROINE OF KNIGHTHOOD
THAN DARE ONE OF YOU HERE TO GO DOWN YONDER AMID COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS HAVE A CARE FRIEND OTTO SAID THE LITTLE LADY OF HOLLAND WITH WARNING FINGER THERE IS ONE HERE AT LEAST WHO DARETH TO GO AMID THE LIONS MY FATHER SIR
TO MAKE HER BOY HERO A CHRISTIAN AND TO BE REVENGED ON THE MURDERER OF HER PARENTS WAS IN TIME FULFILLED
I DO BUT SPEAK THE TRUTH GREAT IS TAI TSUNG WHOM HE WILL HE SLAYETH AND WHOM HE WILL HE KEEPETH ALIVE AND THEN SHE TOLD THE ASTONISHED PRIEST THAT THE BANNERMAN OF THE DRAGON GATE
THE STORY OF JACQUELINE OF HOLLAND IS ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC THAT HAS COME DOWN TO US FROM THOSE ROMANTIC DAYS OF THE KNIGHTS HAPPY ONLY IN HER EARLIEST AND LATEST YEARS SHE IS NEVERTHELESS A BRIGHT AND ATTRACTIVE FIGURE AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF FEUDAL TYRANNY AND CRIME
I SAID NOTHING OF HIM MADAM REPLIED COUNT OTTO I DID MEAN THESE YOUNG RED HATS HERE WHO DO NO MORE DARE TO BAIT YOUR FATHER'S LIONS THAN TO FACE THE CODS OF DORT IN FAIR AND EQUAL FIGHT AT THIS BOLD SPEECH THERE WAS INSTANT COMMOTION
AND REVOLVING STRANGE FANCIES IN HER MIND SHE DETERMINED WHAT SHE WOULD DO WHEN SHE GREW UP AS MANY A GIRL SINCE HER DAY HAS DETERMINED BUT EVEN AS THEY REACHED THE FAIR CITY OF GENEVA THEN HALF ROMAN HALF GALLIC IN ITS BUILDINGS AND ITS LIFE
THE LITTLE CITY BY THE YELLOW RIVER WHERE HER FATHER THE BANNERMAN HELD GUARD AT THE DRAGON GATE HE WAS ABOUT TO CALL OUT TO THE GIRL TO SAVE HERSELF WHEN WITH A SUDDEN SWOOP
SUCCEEDED TO HIS TITLES AND LORDSHIP AS COUNTESS AND LADY SUPREME OF HAINAULT OF HOLLAND AND OF ZEALAND FOR YEARS HOWEVER THERE HAD BEEN THROUGHOUT THE LOW COUNTRIES A STRONG OBJECTION TO THE RULE OF A WOMAN
WHEN EXTENDED TO PERSONS IN PERIL WAS CALLED THE RIGHT OF SANCTUARY
THE DESIRE TO CONVERT HIM FROM PAGANISM AND TO REVENGE HER FATHER'S MURDER TOOK SHAPE IN HER MIND FOR
KING OF THE HUNS SWEEPING DOWN FROM THE EAST WAS RAVAGING THE LANDS ALONG THE UPPER DANUBE AND WITH HIS HOST OF BARBAROUS WARRIORS WAS DEFEATING THE LEGIONS AND DEVASTATING THE LANDS OF THE EMPIRE THE WISE ANTHEMIUS
THAT WERE THEN DISGRACING AND ENDANGERING THE FEEBLE THRONE OF FRANCE THE DREAM OF FUTURE POWER AND GREATNESS AS QUEEN OF FRANCE IN WHICH THE GIRL WIFE OF THE DAUPHIN HAD OFTEN INDULGED WAS THUS RUDELY DISPELLED AND JACQUELINE RETURNED TO HER FATHER'S COURT IN HOLLAND
THAT THE FIRST RECORDED DESIRE OF THIS BEAUTIFUL BRAVE AND DEVOUT YOUNG MAIDEN WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF SAFELY AMONG THE FIERCE FOLLOWERS OF KING CLOVIS WAS A REQUEST FOR VENGEANCE BUT WE MUST REMEMBER GIRLS AND BOYS
HE RAISED THE OTHER IN STERN AND FEARLESS PROTEST AND BOLDLY FACED THE MURDEROUS THRONG BACK MEN OF BLOOD HE CRIED BACK
WAS GREAT AND POWERFUL THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF CHUNG KWOH THE MIDDLE KINGDOM AS THE CHINESE FOR NEARLY THIRTY CENTURIES HAVE CALLED THEIR VAST COUNTRY
HE LEAPED BACK AS BIDDEN THE NEXT INSTANT HE FOUND HIMSELF FLAT UPON HIS BACK IN ONE OF THE LOW CEILED CLIFF CAVES THAT ABOUND IN WESTERN CHINA WHILE THE SCREEN OF VINES THAT HAD CONCEALED ITS ENTRANCE STILL QUIVERED FROM HIS FALL
ON HIS HOMEWARD JOURNEY FROM JERUSALEM
AND WE CANNOT BUT THINK WITH SADNESS UPON THE POWER FOR GOOD THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN HER LAND OF FOGS AND FLOODS IF INSTEAD OF BEING MADE THE TOOL OF PARTY HATE AND THE AMBITIONS OF MEN HER FRANK AND FEARLESS GIRL NATURE
OF THE SAD CONDITION OF ONE WHO IS THE DAUGHTER OF A ROYAL LINE HE BADE ME USE ALL MY WIT TO COME NIGH TO THEE AND TO SAY THAT IF IT BE THE WILL OF THE GODS HE WOULD FAIN RAISE THEE TO HIS RANK BY MARRIAGE
WITH THEIR TRAIN OF ATTENDANT MAIDENS RENOUNCED THE VANITY OF DRESS WEARING ONLY PLAIN AND SIMPLE ROBES THEY SPENT THEIR TIME IN MAKING GARMENTS FOR THE POOR AND EMBROIDERED WORK FOR CHURCH DECORATIONS AND WITH SONG AND PRAYER AND FRUGAL MEALS
NEXT TO HER OWN FEARLESS FATHER NOT THE DAUPHIN JOHN OF FRANCE BUT THIS BRAVE YOUNG REBEL LAD OTTO THE LORD OF ARKELL
BUT AJAX FIERCEST OF THE THREE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE LAD STRAIGHT ACROSS HIS COMRADES HE LOOKED TO WHERE SCARCE A ROD BEHIND THE DARING LAD CAME ANOTHER FIGURE A LIGHT AND GRACEFUL FORM
WITH A LOOK OF PLEASED SURPRISE AT THIS BOLD STROKE OF THE PRINCESS THE PREFECT CLAPPED HIS HANDS IN COMMAND AND THE HEAVILY BROCADED CURTAIN THAT SCREENED THE GILDED COLUMNS PARTED AS IF BY UNSEEN HANDS
AND THE HUNNISH ENVOYS WITH A GAZE OF STOLID WONDER LOOKED DOWN UPON THE GREAT HIPPODROME OF CONSTANTINOPLE IT WAS A VAST ENCLOSURE SPACIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE MARSHALLING OF AN ARMY
MADE A SOLEMN VOW TO DEVOTE THEIR LIVES TO THE KEEPING OF THEIR FATHER'S HERITAGE AND THE ASSISTANCE OF THEIR ONLY BROTHER TO FORSWEAR THE WORLD AND ALL ITS ALLUREMENTS NEVER TO MARRY
ANTHEMIUS THE PREFECT LIKE THE WISE MAN HE WAS RECOGNIZED THE WORTH OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS PULCHERIA HE SAW HOW GREAT WAS HER INFLUENCE OVER HER BROTHER THE EMPEROR AND NOTED WITH ASTONISHMENT AND PLEASURE HER WORDS OF WISDOM
SHREWD YOUNG PRINCESS SHE KNEW HER UNCLE THE KING OF BURGUNDY TOO WELL WHEN ONCE HE WAS ROUSED TO ACTION HE WAS FIERCE AND FURIOUS GOOD AURELIAN
DRAG HER FORTH QUICK AS A FLASH THE BRAVE PRIEST STEPPED BEFORE THE COWERING CHILD
FROM HER STATION IN THE CITADEL SHE LOOKED OVER THE SCENE BEFORE HER HERE ALONG THE LOW BANK OF THE RIVER MAAS STRETCHED THE CAMP OF HER OWN FOLLOWERS AND THE LITTLE GAYLY COLORED BOATS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER ARMY UP THE RIVER FROM THE RED ROOFS OF ROTTERDAM
AND LIKE A BRAVE MAN CALMLY MEET WHAT HE COULD NOT AVOID BUT JUST AS HE HAD SINGLED OUT AS HIS PROBABLE CAPTOR ONE PECULIARLY UNATTRACTIVE LOOKING HORSEMAN WHOSE CRIMSON SHEEPSKIN COAT
IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT USURP THE THRONE AND HOW SHE THE PRINCESS WOO HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO THE SWIFT HWANG HO FROM THE TURBID WATERS OF WHICH SHE HAD BEEN RESCUED BY THE BANNERMAN OF THE DRAGON GATE
SENT ALSO A HAUGHTY CHALLENGE TO THE YOUNG COUNTESS WHO WAS HASTENING TO THE RELIEF OF HER BELEAGUERED TOWN JACQUELINE'S ANSWER WAS SWIFT AND UNMISTAKABLE WITH THREE HUNDRED SHIPS AND SIX THOUSAND KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS
ET CETERA THESE HWANG CLIFFS OR DIRT CLIFFS ARE FULL OF CAVES AND CREVICES BUT THE GOOD PRIEST COULD SEE NO CONVENIENT CAVE AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO BOLDLY FACE HIS FATE
BECAUSE OF CERTAIN BOLD ATTEMPTS TO FAVOR THE CODS IN HIS OWN CASTLE OF ARKELL HIS DEFIANT WORDS THEREFORE RAISED A STORM OF PROTESTS
OVER FLOWER STREWN PAVEMENTS AND THROUGH GORGEOUSLY DECORATED STREETS WITH THE TRUMPETS SOUNDING THEIR LOUDEST WITH SWAYING STANDARDS AND RANK UPON RANK OF IMPERIAL TROOPS WITH GREAT OFFICERS OF THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE MERCHANTS OR CODS WITH THEIR SLOUCH HATS OF QUIET GRAY STRUGGLED FOR THE LEAD IN THE STATE AND HOW THEY DID HATE ONE ANOTHER CERTAIN OF THE YOUNGER NOBLES HOWEVER WHO WERE OPPOSED TO THE REIGNING HOUSE OF HOLLAND
A CRY OF TERROR BROKE FROM EVERY LIP THE DAUPHIN JOHN TURNED PALE WITH FRIGHT AND COUNT WILLIAM OF HOLLAND CALLING OUT DOWN AJAX BACK GIRL BACK
TELL THE COUNTESS JACQUELINE HE SAID TO THE KNIGHT OF LEYENBURG THAT THE HONOR OF HER HAND I CANNOT ACCEPT I AM HER FOE AND WOULD RATHER DIE THAN MARRY HER ALL THE HOT BLOOD OF HER ANCESTORS FLAMED IN WRATH AS YOUNG JACQUELINE HEARD THIS REPLY OF THE REBEL LORD
PREFECT OF THE EAST AND GOVERNOR OR GUARDIAN OF THE YOUNG EMPEROR WAS GREATLY DISTURBED BY THE TIDINGS OF THIS NEW INVASION ALREADY HE HAD REPELLED AT GREAT COST THE FIRST ADVANCE OF THESE TERRIBLE HUNS
YOUNG CLOVIS IN A DRESS OF CRIMSON AND GOLD AND MILK WHITE SILK AND WITH HIS YELLOW HAIR COILED IN A GREAT TOP KNOT ON HIS UNCOVERED HEAD ADVANCED TO MEET HIS BRIDE MY LORD KING SAID CLOTILDA
IN CLINGING ROBES OF BLUE AND UNDERGOWN OF CLOTH OF GOLD THE PRINCESS JACQUELINE HERSELF THE WATCHERS IN THE GALLERY FOLLOWED THE LION'S STARE AND SAW WITH HORROR THE ADVANCING FIGURE OF THIS FAIR YOUNG GIRL
AND THE HAGUE WERE FAST DRAWING TO A CLOSE ON THE FOURTH OF APRIL FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN THE DAUPHIN JOHN DIED BY POISONING IN HIS FATHER'S CASTLE AT COMPIEGNE
AND SHE WAS PLEDGED BY HER DYING FATHER'S COMMAND TO MARRY HER COUSIN WHOM SHE DETESTED DUKE JOHN OF BRABANT BUT HOW MUCH BETTER SO SHE REASONED THAT THE NAME AND MIGHT OF HER HOUSE AS RULERS OF HOLLAND SHOULD BE UPHELD BY A BRAVE AND FEARLESS KNIGHT
SEE LORD OF ARKELL YOU WHO CAN PRATE SO LOUDLY OF CODS AND LIONS HERE BEFORE ALL I DARE YOU TO FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS YOURSELF THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL WAS IN HIS RICH COURT SUIT A TIGHT FITTING GREAT SLEEVED SILK JACKET
IT IS NOT THEREFORE SURPRISING THAT THIS INTREPID AND ROMANCE REARED YOUNG PRINCESS THE WIFE OF A LAD FOR WHOM SHE NEVER ESPECIALLY CARED AND WHOSE SOCIETY HAD FOR POLITICAL REASONS BEEN FORCED UPON HER SHOULD HAVE PLACED AS THE HERO OF HER ADMIRATION
THE YOUNG VON BORSELEN TOOK FROM THE BACK OF THE SETTLE OVER WHICH IT WAS FLUNG HIS GABARDINE THE LONG LOOSE GRAY CLOAK THAT WAS A SORT OF OVERCOAT IN THOSE DAYS OF QUEER COSTUME IT IS HERE MY OTTO HE SAID
AND PLUNDER AND BURN THE LANDS OF THE KING OF BURGUNDY PROBABLY IN NO OTHER WAY COULD THIS WISE YOUNG GIRL OF SEVENTEEN HAVE SO THOROUGHLY PLEASED THE FIERCE AND WARLIKE YOUNG KING HE GLADLY ORDERED HER WISHES TO BE CARRIED OUT
COUNT WILLIAM OF HOLLAND DEARLY LOVED PLUCK AND NERVE WELL DAUGHTER MINE HE SAID
THE LORD OF ARKELL DREW THE LOOSE GRAY CLOAK OVER HIS RICH SILK SUIT AND TURNED TOWARD THE DOOR OTTO VON ARKELL LETS NO ONE CALL HIM FOOL OR COWARD LORD PRINCE HE SAID WHAT I HAVE DARED YOU ALL TO DO I DARE DO IF YOU DO NOT
THE DEATH OF COUNT WILLIAM SHOWED THE CODS A WAY TOWARD GREATER LIBERTY REBELLION FOLLOWED REBELLION AND THE RULE OF THE COUNTESS JACQUELINE WAS BY NO MEANS A RESTFUL ONE AND CHIEF AMONG THE REBELLIOUS SPIRITS AS LEADER AND COUNSELLOR AMONG THE CODS
SIX MUCH ASTONISHED TARTAR ROBBERS REGARDING WITH LOOKS OF PUZZLED WONDER A DEFIANT LITTLE CHINESE GIRL
AND MAKE YOU ALL CAPTIVES AND SLAVES IT SHALL BE WAR BETWEEN YOU AND US FOREVER THUS SAITH MY SPEAR AND AS HE SPOKE HE DASHED HIS LONG SPEAR UPON THE FLOOR UNTIL THE MOSAIC PAVEMENT RANG AGAIN BOY EMPEROR AND PRINCESSES
SEE NOW I WILL FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS THE PRINCESS JACQUELINE SPRANG UP IN PROTEST NO NO YOU SHALL NOT SHE CRIED MY LORD PRINCE DID BUT JEST AS DID WE ALL JOHN SHE SAID TURNING APPEALINGLY TO HER YOUNG HUSBAND WHO SAT SULLEN AND UNMOVED
A RAISED GALLERY LOOKED DOWN INTO THE SPACIOUS INCLOSURE IN WHICH COUNT WILLIAM KEPT THE LIVING SPECIMENS OF HIS OWN PRINCELY BADGE OF THE LION AND HERE THE COMPANY GATHERED TO SEE THE SPORT WITH THE GRAY GABARDINE DRAWN BUT LOOSELY OVER HIS SILKEN SUIT SO THAT HE MIGHT IF NEED BE
HIS MIGHTY EMPIRE STRETCHED FROM THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA TO THE WESTERN ALPS BUT THOUGH HE RAVAGED THE LANDS OF BOTH EASTERN AND WESTERN ROME HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SO MANAGED OR CONTROLLED
FRIEND OTTO IS A BRAVE YOUNG GALLANT ELSE HAD HE NEVER DARED RAISED SPEAR AND BANNER AS HE DID AGAINST HIS RIGHTFUL LIEGE BUT MY FATHER PERSISTED THE GENTLE HEARTED GIRL SPEAR AND BANNER ARE NOT LIONS JAWS AND SURELY YOU MAY NOT IN HONOR PERMIT THE WILFUL MURDER OF A HOSTAGE
T IS EVER BETTER TO BE FRIEND THAN FOE BID I PRAY THAT THE ARRAS OF THE HIPPODROME BE PARTED AND LET OUR GUESTS SEE THE MIGHT AND POWER OF OUR ARMS
RATHER THAN THE FOE OF THE EMPEROR ASK HIM WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE IN KEEPING WITH HIS VALOR AND HIS MIGHT
INTERSPERSED WITH FREQUENT FASTS
AND AMONG ALL THE RACES OF MEN THE ONLY NATION THAT WAS CIVILIZED AND LEARNED AND CULTIVATED AND REFINED IN THIS
AND LONG HORSETAIL PLUME WERE STREAMING IN THE WIND AND JUST AS HE HAD BRACED HIMSELF TO MEET THE ONSET AGAINST THE GREAT LOESS OR DIRT CLIFF HE FELT A TWITCH AT HIS BLACK UPPER ROBE AND A LOW VOICE A GIRL'S
TO ACCOMPLISH HER DESIRES PEACE NEVER CAME TO HER HARASSED BY REBELLION AT HOME AND PERSECUTED BY HER RELENTLESS AND PERFIDIOUS UNCLES COUNT JOHN OF BAVARIA RIGHTLY CALLED THE PITILESS AND DUKE PHILIP OF BURGUNDY FALSELY CALLED THE GOOD
EVEN THE CHIVALRY OF THAT DAY WHICH SHOULD HAVE PROMPTED HIM TO AID RATHER THAN ANNOY THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE RAISED A CONSIDERABLE ARMY AMONG THE KNIGHTS OF THE CODS OR LIBERAL PARTY AND THE WARLIKE MERCHANTS OF THE CITIES TOOK POSSESSION OF MANY STRONG POSITIONS IN HOLLAND
THESE BE BOLD WORDS SAID ANTHEMIUS THE PREFECT AND WHAT IF OUR LORD THE EMPEROR SHALL SAY THEE NAY BUT ERE THE CHIEF OF THE ENVOYS COULD REPLY THE LAD WHOSE PRESENCE IN THE ESCORT
CAME THE STILL HEAVIER BLOW OF HER FATHER'S DEATH ON THE THIRTIETH OF MAY FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN COUNT WILLIAM DIED IN HIS CASTLE OF BOUCHAIN IN HAINAULT AND HIS SORROWING DAUGHTER JACQUELINE NOW A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF SIXTEEN
THAT HER UNCLE'S WORD WAS NOT TO BE LONG DEPENDED UPON AND SHE FEARED TOO THAT CERTAIN ADVISERS AT HER UNCLE'S COURT MIGHT COUNSEL HIM TO DO HER HARM BEFORE THE MESSENGERS OF KING CLOVIS COULD HAVE CONDUCTED HER BEYOND THE BORDERS OF BURGUNDY AURELIAN
BUT NOW THE LORD OF ARKELL HAD FOUND HIS TONGUE MY LORD PRINCE HE SAID BOWING LOW WITH STATELY COURTESY IF AS MY LADY MOTHER AND GOOD COUNT WILLIAM WOULD FORCE ME I AM TO BE LOYAL VASSAL TO YOU MY LIEGES HERE I SHOULD BUT FOLLOW WHERE YOU DARE TO LEAD
HEROES OF THE EASTERN AND WESTERN EMPIRES THE BRIGHT ORIENTAL SUN STREAMED DOWN UPON IT AND AS THE TRUMPETS SOUNDED FROM BENEATH THE IMPERIAL BALCONY
SUBORDINATION PASSIVE SUBMISSION TO THE LAW TO PARENTS AND TO ALL SUPERIORS AND A PEACEFUL DEMEANOR
FOR HER CRUEL UNCLE GUNDEBALD WAGING WAR AGAINST HIS BROTHER CHILPERIC THE RIGHTFUL KING OF BURGUNDY HAD WITH A BAND OF SAVAGE FOLLOWERS BURST INTO HIS BROTHER'S PALACE AND AFTER THE FIERCE AND RELENTLESS FASHION OF THOSE CRUEL DAYS
PICKING HIMSELF UP AND BREATHING A PRAYER OF THANKS FOR HIS DELIVERANCE HE PEERED THROUGH THE LEAFY DOORWAY
HE BROUGHT ALL THE LAND UNDER HIS SWAY FROM THE RHINE TO THE RHONE THE OCEAN AND THE PYRENEES HE WAS HAILED BY HIS PEOPLE WITH THE OLD ROMAN TITLES OF CONSUL AND AUGUSTUS
THAT THE TONGUE IS A LITTLE MEMBER BUT IT CAN KINDLE A GREAT FIRE HOW MAYST THOU HOPE TO SAY SUCH DIREFUL WORDS AGAINST THE SON OF HEAVEN
OF A GIRLISH PRINCESS OF SIXTEEN GRANDDAUGHTER AND SOLE INHERITOR OF THE GENIUS AND COURAGE OF THEODOSIUS THE GREAT GOVERNING THE EMPIRES OF THE EAST AND WEST AND BEING PROCLAIMED ON THE DEATH OF HER BROTHER
HEAR YE SIR HERALD AND ANSWER THUS TO THE REBEL LORD OF ARKELL FOR THE PURPOSE OF FIGHTING HIM CAME WE HERE AND FIGHT HIM WE WILL UNTIL HE AND HIS REBELS ARE BEATEN AND DEAD LONG LIVE OUR SOVEREIGN LADY OF HOLLAND ON THE MORROW
BUT WITH AN AIR OF OPEN AND HOSTILE SUPERIORITY THAT WOULD NOT BE MOVED EVEN BY ALL THE GLOW AND GLITTER OF AN IMPERIAL COURT THEN ESLAW THE CHIEF OF THE ENVOYS OF KING RUAS THE HUN MADE KNOWN HIS MASTER'S DEMANDS
PULCHERIA OF CONSTANTINOPLE THE GIRL OF THE GOLDEN HORN AFTERWARD KNOWN AS PULCHERIA AUGUSTA EMPRESS OF THE EAST
NO JURY HEARING THE EVIDENCE WOULD FIND HIM GUILTY OF THE ONLY CHARGE THAT COULD BE FORMALLY BROUGHT AGAINST HIM THE CHARGE OF HOMICIDE BY PREMEDITATION HOMICIDE BY MISADVENTURE OCCURRING IN A DUEL WAS NOT A PUNISHABLE OFFENSE BY THE FRENCH LAW
PROMISE ON YOUR WORD OF HONOR PROMISE YOU WILL LEAVE IT TO ME WILL YOU TELL HIM YOURSELF IF I LEAVE IT TO YOU YES AT MY OWN TIME PROMISE HUSH HUSH DON'T EXCITE YOURSELF MY LOVE I PROMISE GIVE ME A KISS
DO YOU SEE ANY EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE IN ME STELLA ASKED WITH A FAINT SMILE
INSTEAD OF ANSWERING HE REPEATED THE STRANGE QUESTION WHICH HE HAD PUT TO ME DOWNSTAIRS DO YOU CALL IT A QUIET NIGHT CONSIDERING THE TIME OF YEAR AND THE EXPOSED SITUATION OF THE HOUSE THE NIGHT WAS ALMOST PRETERNATURALLY QUIET
I VENTURED INTO THE HOUSE TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO ROMAYNE HE WAS IN THE STUDY AND HIS EXCELLENT FRIEND AND SECRETARY WAS WITH HIM AFTER THE FIRST GREETINGS PENROSE LEFT US
LORD LORING WELL KNOWN IN SOCIETY AS THE HEAD OF AN OLD ENGLISH CATHOLIC FAMILY AND THE POSSESSOR OF A MAGNIFICENT GALLERY OF PICTURES WAS DISTRESSED BY THE CHANGE FOR THE WORSE WHICH HE PERCEIVED IN ROMAYNE WHEN HE CALLED AT THE HOTEL
BUT HE LOOKED AS IF HE LIVED IN A DIFFERENT WORLD FROM MINE
THROUGHOUT THE VAST OPEN COUNTRY ALL ROUND US NOT EVEN A BREATH OF AIR COULD BE HEARD THE NIGHT BIRDS WERE AWAY OR WERE SILENT AT THE TIME BUT ONE SOUND WAS AUDIBLE WHEN WE STOOD STILL AND LISTENED THE COOL QUIET BUBBLE OF A LITTLE STREAM
I WAS PRESENT WHEN THEY MET AND ROSE TO LEAVE THE ROOM FEELING THAT THE TWO FRIENDS MIGHT PERHAPS BE EMBARRASSED BY THE PRESENCE OF A THIRD PERSON ROMAYNE CALLED ME BACK LORD LORING OUGHT TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME HE SAID I HAVE NO HEART TO SPEAK OF IT MYSELF
HE SLEPT UNTIL NOON THERE WAS NO RETURN OF THE TORMENT OF THE VOICE AS HE CALLED IT POOR FELLOW
I ASKED FIRST OF COURSE FOR THE LADY OF THE HOUSE AND HEARING SHE WAS IN THE GROUNDS JOINED HER THERE SHE LOOKED ILL AND ANXIOUS AND SHE RECEIVED ME WITH RIGID POLITENESS FORTUNATELY
NO ONE HOWEVER COULD DOUBT LORD LORING'S ADMIRABLE DEVOTION TO HIS FRIEND AND WITH THAT I WAS FAIN TO BE CONTENT
EVEN THE EVENT OF HIS DEATH HAD FAILED TO DISSIPATE THE DELUSION WHICH ASSOCIATED HIM WITH SOME UNDEFINED EVIL INFLUENCE THAT MIGHT YET ASSERT ITSELF A SUPERSTITIOUS FOREWARNING OF THIS SORT WAS A WEAKNESS NEW TO HER IN HER EXPERIENCE OF HERSELF SHE WAS HEARTILY ASHAMED OF IT
I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF ASKING TO SEE PENROSE ALONE FOR A MOMENT AND THIS REQUEST GRANTED ROMAYNE AND I PARTED CORDIALLY I CAN MAKE MOST PEOPLE LIKE ME WHEN I CHOOSE TO TRY
I AM USED TO WAKEFUL NIGHTS GO BACK TO BED AND DON'T BE UNEASY ABOUT ME THE NEXT MORNING THE DEFERRED EXPLANATION WAS PUT OFF AGAIN
I WON'T ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK OF THEM I REFUSE TO REPEAT THE WORDS HE POINTED OVER THE NORTHWARD PARAPET
MISSUS EYRECOURT NOW CONVALESCENT WAS STAYING AT TEN ACRES AND WAS THEN TAKING THE AIR IN HER CHAIR ON WHEELS THE GOOD LADY'S NIMBLE AND DISCURSIVE TONGUE OFFERED ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF REFERRING
WOULD IT BE DESIRABLE TO ENLIGHTEN LADY LORING AS SHE HAD ALREADY ENLIGHTENED STELLA MISSUS EYRECOURT DECIDED IN THE NEGATIVE AS ROMAN CATHOLICS AND AS OLD FRIENDS OF ROMAYNE THE LORINGS NATURALLY REJOICED IN HIS CONVERSION
IT WAS A DREARY EXISTENCE AND HAPPIER INFLUENCES SEEMED BUT LITTLE LIKELY TO CHANGE IT GRATEFUL AS SHE WAS TO HER MOTHER NO PERSUASION WOULD INDUCE STELLA TO LEAVE TEN ACRES AND AMUSE HERSELF IN LONDON
ROMAYNE WAS DISPOSED TO BE EQUALLY UNREASONABLE BUT IN THIS CASE EVENTS DECLARED THEMSELVES IN MY FAVOR LADY BERRICK'S LAST RESERVES OF STRENGTH HAD GIVEN WAY
THREE TIMES IN THE NIGHT I WOKE AND SEEING THE LIGHT BURNING IN HIS ROOM LOOKED IN AT HIM HE ALWAYS CARRIED SOME OF HIS BOOKS WITH HIM WHEN HE TRAVELED
WHEN LORD LORING TOOK HIS DEPARTURE I ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL PERCEIVING THAT HE WISHED TO SAY A WORD MORE TO ME IN PRIVATE HE HAD IT SEEMED DECIDED ON WAITING FOR THE RESULT OF THE MEDICAL CONSULTATION BEFORE HE TRIED THE EFFECT OF THE YOUNG LADY'S ATTRACTIONS
HE SAID BY THIS TIME MY LITTLE FIT OF ILL TEMPER WAS AT AN END I ANSWERED AND IT WAS REALLY IN A CERTAIN SENSE TRUE I KNOW ARTHUR TOO WELL TO BE ANGRY WITH HIM
WE HAD RETURNED FROM A RIDE ROMAYNE HAD GONE INTO THE LIBRARY TO READ
YES HOW IS HE TO FIND IT OUT IF YOU PLEASE I AM AFRAID THROUGH FATHER BENWELL YES YES I KNOW YOU ONLY THINK HIM A FAWNING OLD HYPOCRITE YOU DON'T FEAR HIM AS I DO
YOU MAY WIN HIM BACK TO YOU BY A WORD AND DO YOU HESITATE TO SAY THE WORD I SHALL TELL HIM STELLA SUDDENLY DREW HERSELF AWAY FROM HER MOTHER'S CARESSING ARM
BE ADVISED BY ME MY POOR DEAR AND WE WILL TURN THE PRIEST OUT OF THE HOUSE YET WHEN ROMAYNE COMES BACK FROM HIS RIDICULOUS RETREAT AFTER HIS FASTING AND FLAGELLATION AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT BESIDES
IT WAS SUSPECTED IN THE TOWN THAT THE GENERAL WAS MORE OR LESS DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH CERTAIN DISREPUTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES DISCOVERED BY THE AUTHORITIES
HE WAS SO NICE AND SYMPATHETIC SUCH A COMFORTING CONTRAST ON THAT OCCASION TO YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND I DECLARE I FORGOT EVERY REASON I HAD FOR NOT TRUSTING HIM AH WE WOMEN ARE POOR CREATURES WE MAY OWN IT AMONG OURSELVES
WHY SHOULDN'T HE MARRY A WOMAN'S INFLUENCE BY MERELY GIVING A NEW TURN TO HIS THOUGHTS MIGHT CHARM AWAY THAT HORRIBLE VOICE WHICH HAUNTS HIM PERHAPS YOU THINK THIS A MERELY SENTIMENTAL VIEW OF THE CASE LOOK AT IT PRACTICALLY IF YOU LIKE AND YOU COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION
AND YET IT KEPT ITS HOLD ONCE MORE THE BOOK DROPPED ON HER LAP SHE LAID IT ASIDE AND WALKED WEARILY TO THE WINDOW TO LOOK AT THE WEATHER ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT MISSUS EYRECOURT'S MAID DISTURBED HER MISTRESS OVER THE SECOND VOLUME OF THE NOVEL BY ENTERING THE ROOM WITH A LETTER
WHAT I FELT AND FEARED IN THIS MISERABLE STATE OF THINGS MATTERS LITTLE THE ONE CHANCE I COULD SEE FOR ROMAYNE WAS TO OBTAIN THE BEST MEDICAL ADVICE
MY CORRESPONDENT CITED MANY CASES IN PROOF OF IT STRENGTHENED BY THE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED OPINION OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS BERRYER HIMSELF IN A WORD WE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR
HAD DETERMINED HIM NEVER TO ENTER MY HOUSE AGAIN BY WAY OF ADDING TO YOUR INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT OF PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT I MAY NOW TELL YOU THAT MISSUS ROMAYNE HAS FORBIDDEN PENROSE TO PROCEED WITH THE ATTEMPT TO CONVERT ME
HE RECONSIDERED THAT BRIEF ANSWER AND CONTRADICTED HIMSELF YES THE LIBRARY FIRE HAS BURNED LOW I SUPPOSE IN MY POSITION AT THE TABLE I HAD SEEN THE FIRE THE GRATE WAS HEAPED WITH BLAZING COALS AND WOOD I SAID NOTHING
TELL THE SERVANTS TO HAVE THE HORSES READY THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WE LEAVE VANGE ABBEY TO MORROW THESE WERE WILD WORDS IF HE HAD SPOKEN THEM WILDLY I MIGHT HAVE SHARED THE BUTLER'S CONCLUSION THAT HIS MIND WAS DERANGED
HE WON'T LEAVE ME UP HERE BY MYSELF LETTING THIS STRANGE ASSERTION REMAIN UNANSWERED THE BUTLER WITHDREW
HIS MIND WOULD HAVE DWELT ON THE CHAPEL OR THE MISSION OR THE INFANT SCHOOL IN WANT OF FUNDS AND WITH NO MORE ABOMINABLE OBJECT IN VIEW THAN I HAVE AT THIS MOMENT IN POKING THE FIRE HE WOULD HAVE ENDED IN PRODUCING HIS MODEST SUBSCRIPTION LIST AND WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIMSELF
ROMAYNE WAS CONSTANTLY ABSENT IN LONDON ATTENDING TO HIS NEW RELIGIOUS DUTIES UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF FATHER BENWELL THE LITTER OF BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS IN THE STUDY WAS SEEN NO MORE HIDEOUSLY RIGID ORDER REIGNED IN THE UNUSED ROOM
THE BOULOGNE POSTMARK WAS ON ONE OF THE ENVELOPES AT ROMAYNE'S ENTREATY THIS WAS THE LETTER THAT I OPENED FIRST THE SURGEON'S SIGNATURE WAS AT THE END ONE MOTIVE FOR ANXIETY ON MY PART WAS SET AT REST IN THE FIRST LINES
SUCH AT LEAST IS MY EXPERIENCE DRAWN FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF OTHER DAYS
I AM OF THE RACE OF CAIN HE HAD THE MARK SET ON HIS BROW I HAVE MY ORDEAL DELUDE YOURSELF IF YOU LIKE WITH FALSE HOPES I CAN ENDURE AND HOPE FOR NOTHING
WHEN I HEAR OF ROMAYNE AND HIS RETREAT I ALMOST FEEL INCLINED TO SPIT MYSELF THERE LET US GO ON WITH YOUR READING TAKE THE FIRST VOLUME I HAVE DONE WITH IT WHAT IS IT MAMA
I AM GETTING LEARNED IN THE HIERARCHY OF THE CHURCH FATHER BENWELL YOU ARE THE SUPERIOR OF MY DEAR LITTLE FRIEND AND YOU EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER HIM OH HE IS THE KINDEST AND BEST OF MEN IT IS NOT HIS FAULT
FEARING I KNEW NOT WHAT I MOUNTED THE LADDER WHICH LED TO THE ROOF ROMAYNE RECEIVED ME WITH A HARSH OUTBURST OF LAUGHTER THAT SADDEST FALSE LAUGHTER WHICH IS TRUE TROUBLE IN DISGUISE HERE'S SOMETHING TO AMUSE YOU HE CRIED
A VERY REMARKABLE WORK STELLA IN THE PRESENT STATE OF LIGHT LITERATURE IN ENGLAND A NOVEL THAT ACTUALLY TELLS A STORY IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE I KNOW TRY THE BOOK IT HAS ANOTHER EXTRAORDINARY MERIT IT ISN'T WRITTEN BY A WOMAN
AND LEFT THE ROOM I HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO DO
DO YOU HEAR IT CONTINUOUSLY NO AT INTERVALS SOMETIMES LONGER SOMETIMES SHORTER
PROBABLY FEARING THAT I HAD SOME KNOWLEDGE OF HER LETTER WARNING WINTERFIELD NOT TO TRUST ME IF SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN INFORMED THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE BLAMED BUT TO BE PITIED IN THE MATTER OF THE MARRIAGE AT BRUSSELS
I WAS AFRAID THAT THE NOISE OF THE TRAFFIC IN THE STREETS MIGHT BRING IT BACK TO ME AS YOU KNOW I PASSED A QUIET NIGHT I HAD THE HOPE THAT MY IMAGINATION HAD DECEIVED ME THAT I WAS THE VICTIM OF A DELUSION AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS NO DELUSION
IN ORDER THAT WINTERFIELD IF HE INTENDED TO DO SO MIGHT HAVE TIME TO COMMUNICATE WITH MISSUS ROMAYNE AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE COUNTRY NATURALLY ENOUGH PERHAPS CONSIDERING THE DELICACY OF THE SUBJECT
I HEAR THE BOY AS PLAINLY AS YOU HEAR ME THE VOICE SCREAMS AT ME THROUGH THE CLEAR MOONLIGHT AS IT SCREAMED AT ME THROUGH THE SEA FOG AGAIN AND AGAIN IT'S ALL ROUND THE HOUSE THAT WAY NOW WHERE THE LIGHT JUST TOUCHES ON THE TOPS OF THE HEATHER
FOR ME STELLA ASKED LOOKING ROUND FROM THE WINDOW NO MA'AM FOR MISSUS EYRECOURT THE LETTER HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO THE HOUSE BY ONE OF LADY LORING'S SERVANTS IN DELIVERING IT HE HAD APPARENTLY GIVEN PRIVATE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE MAID
HE AND HIS WIFE AND FAMILY HAD LEFT BOULOGNE
HIS HEAD DROOPED HIS EYES HALF CLOSED HE LOOKED LIKE A WEARY MAN QUIETLY FALLING ASLEEP ON LEAVING THE STEAMBOAT I VENTURED TO ASK OUR CHARMING FELLOW PASSENGER IF I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE IN RESERVING PLACES IN THE LONDON TRAIN
THAT THIS SECOND INDISCREET INTERFERENCE OF HIS WIFE BETWEEN HIS FRIEND AND HIMSELF WILL PRODUCE THE VERY RESULT WHICH SHE DREADS MARK MY WORDS WRITTEN AFTER THE CLOSEST OBSERVATION OF HIM
MISTER ROMAYNE IS NOT VERY WELL I SAID AND I CANNOT VENTURE TO ASK YOU INTO THE HOUSE
THEN WHERE IS THE OBSTACLE I EXCLAIMED HE POINTED THROUGH THE WINDOW TO HIS WIFE THERE IS THE OBSTACLE HE SAID IN A TONE OF IRONICAL RESIGNATION KNOWING ARTHUR'S CHARACTER AS I KNEW IT
ROMAYNE SEEMED TO BE RELIEVED I ONLY TROUBLED YOU WITH THIS LAST DOMESTIC INCIDENT HE RESUMED TO BESPEAK YOUR INDULGENCE FOR PENROSE
WE SHALL HAVE ROMAYNE WITH A RED NOSE AND A DOUBLE CHIN OFFERING TO PRAY FOR US NEXT DO YOU RECOLLECT THAT FRENCH MAID OF MINE THE WOMAN I SENT AWAY BECAUSE SHE WOULD SPIT WHEN SHE WAS OUT OF TEMPER LIKE A CAT I BEGIN TO THINK I TREATED THE POOR CREATURE HARSHLY
AND MIGHT HAVE RECKONED THE CIRCUMSTANCE AMONG THE WISELY IMPROVED OPPORTUNITIES OF MY LIFE TO RETURN TO THE SERIOUS INTERESTS OF THE PRESENT NARRATIVE I MAY NOW ANNOUNCE THAT MY EVIDENCE AS AN EYE WITNESS OF EVENTS HAS COME TO AN END
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT MISSUS EYRECOURT MIGHT BE OCCUPYING THE CUSTOMARY FALSE POSITION OF A MOTHER IN LAW I WAS MISTAKEN HE WAS NOT THINKING OF HIS WIFE'S MOTHER HE WAS THINKING OF HIS WIFE
I DIDN'T ASK HIM WHAT IT MEANT WHATEVER IT IS I SUPPOSE HE IS THERE NOW MY DEAR DON'T YOU REMEMBER YOUR SISTER BEGAN IN THE SAME WAY SHE RETREATED
I RECOGNIZED THE ELDERLY FAT AND CHEERFUL PRIEST WHO HAD SHOWN SUCH A KNOWLEDGE OF LOCALITIES AND SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST IN VANGE ABBEY
YOU MAY THINK THAT I SPOKE IN THIS WAY WITH A VIEW TO MY INDULGENT LANGUAGE BEING REPEATED TO ROMAYNE AND SO IMPROVING THE POSITION WHICH I HAVE ALREADY GAINED IN HIS ESTIMATION DO YOU KNOW I REALLY BELIEVE I MEANT IT AT THE TIME
HIS MANNER TOLD ME PLAINLY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG I ASKED NO QUESTIONS WAITING ON THE CHANCE THAT ROMAYNE MIGHT ENLIGHTEN ME
NOTHING WILL PERSUADE ME THAT ZEAL FOR HIS RELIGION IS THE MOTIVE UNDER WHICH THAT MAN ACTS IN DEVOTING HIMSELF TO ROMAYNE HE HAS SOME ABOMINABLE OBJECT IN VIEW AND HIS EYES TELL ME THAT I AM CONCERNED IN IT MISSUS EYRECOURT BURST OUT LAUGHING
THE RUINS OF THE OLD MONASTERY ARE VISIBLE FROM ALL POINTS OF THE COMPASS THERE ARE TRADITIONS OF THRIVING VILLAGES CLUSTERING ABOUT THE ABBEY IN THE DAYS OF THE MONKS AND OF HOSTLERIES DEVOTED TO THE RECEPTION OF PILGRIMS FROM EVERY PART OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
BUT PRAY DON'T MENTION THIS LITTLE FRAILTY OF MINE AND DON'T SUPPOSE I HAVE ANY SYMPATHY WITH HIS WEAK MINDED SUBMISSION TO MISSUS ROMAYNE'S PREJUDICES IF I EVER FELT THE SMALLEST CONSIDERATION FOR HER AND I CANNOT CALL TO MIND
I WILL SEE TO IT MYSELF WHAT INTEREST CAN YOU HAVE IN THE INQUIRIES I EXCLAIMED THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE INTEREST HE ANSWERED IT HAS BEEN MY ONE HOPE TO MAKE SOME LITTLE ATONEMENT TO THE POOR PEOPLE WHOM I HAVE SO CRUELLY WRONGED
THE SOLITUDE WAS AS VOID OF ANY LIVING CREATURE AS IF WE HAD BEEN SURROUNDED BY THE AWFUL DEAD WORLD OF THE MOON WAS IT THE BOY'S VOICE THAT YOU HEARD ON THE VOYAGE ACROSS THE CHANNEL I ASKED YES I HEARD IT FOR THE FIRST TIME
ARTHUR HAS BEEN BEFOREHAND WITH ME THERE
I MUST ASK FOR INSTRUCTIONS FROM OUR MOST REVEREND GENERAL ON THE SUBJECT OF ARTHUR PENROSE I BELIEVE THAT I INFORMED YOU THAT I DECIDED TO DEFER MY NEXT VISIT TO TEN ACRES LODGE FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS
MISSUS EYRECO URT'S DISCOVERY THE LEAVES HAD FALLEN IN THE GROUNDS AT TEN ACRES LODGE AND STORMY WINDS TOLD DREARILY THAT WINTER HAD COME AN UNCHANGING DULLNESS PERVADED THE HOUSE
AND THAT IT MAY BE DEPENDED ON THROUGHOUT AS AN EXACT STATEMENT OF THE TRUTH
THE HOUSE STANDS DEFYING TIME AND WEATHER TO THE PRESENT DAY
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS ENTIRELY AT HIS SERVICE HAVING QUIETED HIS ANXIETY ON THIS POINT I REMINDED HIM OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN US ON BOARD THE STEAMBOAT HE TRIED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT MY CURIOSITY WAS TOO STRONGLY AROUSED TO PERMIT THIS
WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED AND STOOD LOOKING AT IT WITH AN INTEREST WHICH WAS SO INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME THAT I OWN I WATCHED HIM HE ASCENDED THE SLOPE OF THE MOORLAND AND ENTERED THE GATE WHICH LED TO THE GROUNDS ALL THAT THE GARDENERS HAD DONE TO MAKE THE PLACE ATTRACTIVE
WHERE IS THAT CONTEMPTIBLE HUSBAND OF YOURS MISSUS EYRECOURT ASKED LOOKING UP FROM HER BOOK LEWIS IS STAYING IN TOWN STELLA ANSWERED LISTLESSLY IN COMPANY WITH JUDAS ISCARIOT STELLA WAS TOO DULL TO IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND THE ALLUSION
SHE HAS ALWAYS POOR DEAR HAD AN INVETERATE DISTRUST OF FATHER BENWELL AND BETWEEN OURSELVES I AM NOT SURE THAT SHE IS QUITE SO FOOLISH AS I ONCE THOUGHT THE FATHER HAS UNEXPECTEDLY LEFT US WITH A WELL FRAMED EXCUSE WHICH SATISFIED LORD LORING
LOST TO VIEW IN THE VALLEY GROUND TO THE SOUTH I HAVE TOLD YOU ALREADY I SAID SO STILL A NIGHT I NEVER REMEMBER ON THIS YORKSHIRE MOOR HE LAID ONE HAND HEAVILY ON MY SHOULDER
IS TO FILL THE PLACE FROM WHICH PENROSE HAS WITHDRAWN I ABSTAINED FROM BREATHING A WORD OF THIS TO ROMAYNE IT IS HE IF I CAN MANAGE IT WHO MUST INVITE ME TO COMPLETE THE WORK OF CONVERSION
WHEN HE SUDDENLY TURNED PALE AND LIFTED HIS HEAD LIKE A MAN WHOSE ATTENTION IS UNEXPECTEDLY ROUSED
DOES THIS SUDDEN ENTHUSIASM OF MINE SURPRISE YOU AND ARE YOU ALTOGETHER AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IT MEANS MY FRIEND THAT I SEE OUR POSITION TOWARD ROMAYNE IN A NEW LIGHT
YES DO MY QUESTIONS ANNOY YOU I MAKE NO COMPLAINT HE SAID SADLY YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF I PATIENTLY SUFFER THE PUNISHMENT THAT I HAVE DESERVED I CONTRADICTED HIM AT ONCE
I DECLARE I AM AGITATED MYSELF SHE EXCLAIMED FALLING BACK INTO HER CUSTOMARY MANNER SUCH A SHOCK TO MY VANITY STELLA THE PROSPECT OF BECOMING A GRANDMOTHER I REALLY MUST RING FOR MATILDA AND TAKE A FEW DROPS OF RED LAVENDER
AND HE WISHED TO CAUTION ME AGAINST SPEAKING PREMATURELY OF VISITING THE PICTURE GALLERY TO OUR FRIEND NOT FEELING PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THESE DETAILS OF THE WORTHY NOBLEMAN'S LITTLE PLOT I LOOKED AT HIS CARRIAGE AND PRIVATELY ADMIRED THE TWO SPLENDID HORSES THAT DREW IT
I SUPPOSE I FORESTALLED MY NIGHT'S SLEEP ON THE RAILWAY HE SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER I AM CONTENT
WHAT IS THERE TO LAUGH AT STELLA ASKED I DECLARE MY DEAR THERE IS SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY PROVOKING IN YOUR UTTER WANT OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD WHEN YOU ARE PUZZLED TO ACCOUNT FOR ANYTHING REMARKABLE IN A CLERGYMAN'S CONDUCT I DON'T CARE MY POOR CHILD TO WHAT DENOMINATION HE BELONGS
THERE WAS A NATIVE SWEETNESS IN ROMAYNE'S DISPOSITION WHICH ASSERTED ITSELF EVEN IN HIS WORST MOMENTS OF NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE TOOK MY HAND DON'T BE HARD ON ME HE PLEADED I WILL TRY TO THINK OF IT AS YOU DO
SOME OF ROMAYNE'S PAPERS HAD BEEN BURNED OTHERS WERE IMPRISONED IN DRAWERS AND CUPBOARDS THE HISTORY OF THE ORIGIN OF RELIGIONS HAD TAKEN ITS MELANCHOLY PLACE AMONG THE SUSPENDED LITERARY ENTERPRISES OF THE TIME
THE PROPER PERSON TO BE WITH YOU IS A DOCTOR I REALLY FELT IRRITATED WITH HIM AND I SAW NO REASON FOR CONCEALING IT ANOTHER MAN IN HIS PLACE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OFFENDED WITH ME
DO COME SIR AND LOOK AT THE MASTER
WITH THOSE WORDS HE LEFT US TOGETHER IT IS ALMOST NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT LORD LORING DID AGREE WITH ME HE WAS HIMSELF DISPOSED TO THINK THAT THE MORAL REMEDY IN ROMAYNE'S CASE MIGHT PROVE TO BE THE BEST REMEDY
STANDING BESIDE IT AND THE COCK IS SCRAPING AWAY THE EARTH FOR THE HENS LOOK HOW HE STRUTS AND NOW WE ARE CLOSE TO THE CHURCH IT LIES HIGH UPON THE HILL BETWEEN THE LARGE OAK TREES ONE OF WHICH IS HALF DECAYED
AND NOW AND THEN WHEN THE WIND BLEW HE COULD ALSO HEAR THE PEOPLE SINGING WHO WERE SITTING AT TEA WHERE THE CONFECTIONER HAD HIS TENT BUT THE DEEP SOUND OF THE BELL ROSE LOUDER
IN THE MIDST OF THE SHOES STOOD A PAIR OF RED ONES JUST LIKE THOSE THE PRINCESS HAD WORN HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY WERE
SHOULD HAVE THE TITLE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER EVEN IF IT WERE NOT REALLY A BELL MANY PERSONS NOW WENT TO THE WOOD FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE PLACE
FOR YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS LOVE OUR NATIVE LAND I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT ANOTHER SHADOW AGAIN HAVE I ANYTHING TO PAY TO IT OR YOU IF SO YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY SAYING WHAT IT IS
HE FOUND HOWEVER A LITTLE SIDE DOOR OPEN AND THROUGH THIS HE WENT AND STEPPED INTO OUR NEW MARKET OF THE PRESENT TIME IT WAS A HUGE DESOLATE PLAIN SOME WILD BUSHES STOOD UP HERE AND THERE WHILE ACROSS THE FIELD FLOWED A BROAD CANAL OR RIVER
I TAKE ALL HIS FLOWERS AND TREES AND PLANT THEM OUT IN THE GREAT GARDEN OF PARADISE IN THE UNKNOWN LAND BUT HOW THEY GROW THERE AND HOW IT IS THERE I DARE NOT TELL THEE GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD SAID THE MOTHER
HE SHOT AN ARROW ONCE AT YOUR OLD GRANDMOTHER BUT THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO AND IT IS ALL PAST NOW HOWEVER A THING OF THAT SORT SHE NEVER FORGETS
JUST AS EVERYONE HAPPENS TO BE SETTLED THEY LOOK LIKE OTHER PLANTS BUT THEY HAVE PULSATIONS OF THE HEART
AND WOOD AND SEA WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT COMING BY A PATH TO THE RIGHT APPEARED IN HIS WOODEN SHOES AND JACKET THE POOR BOY WHO HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WITH HIM HE HAD FOLLOWED HIS OWN PATH
AND THE TINTS OF HIS MANY COLORED ARROWS RAN ONE INTO THE OTHER THE OLD POET SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HIS HEARTH AND TOOK THE LITTLE FELLOW ON HIS LAP HE SQUEEZED THE WATER OUT OF HIS DRIPPING HAIR
AND NOW WE SHALL HEAR WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SECOND STORY A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL IN A LARGE TOWN WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY HOUSES AND SO MANY PEOPLE
AND AMONGST THEM WAS A PRINCESS WHO WAS TROUBLED WITH SEEING TOO WELL AND THAT WAS SO ALARMING SHE DIRECTLY OBSERVED THAT THE STRANGER WHO HAD JUST COME WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT SORT OF PERSON TO ALL THE OTHERS
BUT THE OLD MAN WAS GONE AND HER LITTLE CHILD WAS GONE HE HAD TAKEN IT WITH HIM AND THE OLD CLOCK IN THE
IN A WINDOW AND LET HERSELF BE STARED AT SHE HAD NEITHER A TRAIN NOR A GOLDEN CROWN BUT SPLENDID RED MOROCCO SHOES THEY WERE CERTAINLY FAR HANDSOMER
IN THE LARGE HUGE EMPTY SPACE ABOVE HIM AND ON SHE FLEW WITH HIM FLEW HIGH OVER THE BLACK CLOUDS WHILE THE STORM MOANED AND WHISTLED AS THOUGH IT WERE SINGING SOME OLD TUNE
OF THE WHOLE HUMAN VARNISH THAT MAKES A MAN PERCEPTIBLE I TOOK MY WAY I TELL IT TO YOU BUT YOU WILL NOT PUT IT IN ANY BOOK I TOOK MY WAY TO THE CAKE WOMAN I HID MYSELF BEHIND HER
WHERE THE BITTER TANSY GREW BUT FOR HER THERE WAS NEITHER PEACE NOR REST AND WHEN SHE DANCED TOWARDS THE OPEN CHURCH DOOR SHE SAW AN ANGEL STANDING THERE HE WORE LONG WHITE GARMENTS
AT THE CHURCH DOOR STOOD AN OLD SOLDIER WITH A CRUTCH AND WITH A WONDERFULLY LONG BEARD WHICH WAS MORE RED THAN WHITE AND HE BOWED TO THE GROUND AND ASKED THE OLD LADY WHETHER HE MIGHT DUST HER SHOES AND KAREN STRETCHED OUT HER LITTLE FOOT
IT WAS LATE COUNCILLOR KNAP DEEPLY OCCUPIED WITH THE TIMES OF KING HANS INTENDED TO GO HOME AND MALICIOUS FATE MANAGED MATTERS SO THAT HIS FEET INSTEAD OF FINDING THEIR WAY TO HIS OWN GALOSHES SLIPPED INTO THOSE OF FORTUNE
BE BOILED BLACK AND LAID ON SILVER DISHES AFTER THIS SPEECH WAS MADE THE OLD ONES CREPT INTO THEIR SHELLS AND NEVER MORE CAME OUT
TO HAVE READ OVER HIS LESSON AGAIN BUT THAT YOU KNOW HE COULD NOT DO HE THEREFORE PUT HIS GEOGRAPHY BOOK UNDER HIS PILLOW BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD THAT WAS A VERY GOOD THING TO DO WHEN ONE WANTS TO LEARN ONE'S LESSON
FOR THE SHOES CARRIED HER THROUGH THE GATE INTO THE FIELDS ACROSS ROADS AND BRIDGES AND SHE MUST KEEP EVER DANCING ONE MORNING SHE DANCED PAST A DOOR WHICH SHE WELL KNEW WITHIN SOUNDED A PSALM
AND REMEMBER ALL THAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME BUT YOU MUST SHOW ME THE OLD MAN'S GRAVE BUT I DO NOT KNOW IT SAID HE AND NO ONE KNOWS IT ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE DEAD
THE THING IS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND IT SAID THE NARRATOR LET US ASK OLD NANNY THAT WAS NO FAIRY TALE TIS TRUE SAID OLD NANNY BUT NOW IT'S COMING THE MOST WONDERFUL FAIRY TALES GROW OUT OF THAT WHICH IS REALITY
AND HAD COME WITH THEIR GRATULATIONS THAT VERY MORNING BUT THE OLD PEOPLE HAD FORGOTTEN IT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ABLE TO REMEMBER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED MANY YEARS AGO AND THE ELDERBUSH SENT FORTH A STRONG ODOUR IN THE SUN THAT WAS JUST ABOUT TO SET
THAT YOU STILL ARE AND HAD A LONG YELLOW SILK HANDKERCHIEF ROUND YOUR NECK AND A BRAN NEW HAT ON OH YOU WERE SO DASHING GOOD HEAVENS WHAT WEATHER IT WAS AND WHAT A STATE THE STREET WAS IN
THE WOMAN EXAMINED HIM WITH EYES OF ASTONISHMENT AND SHOOK HER HEAD SHE THEN ADDRESSED HIM IN GERMAN THE COUNCILLOR THOUGHT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND DANISH AND THEREFORE REPEATED HIS WISH IN GERMAN THIS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS COSTUME STRENGTHENED THE GOOD WOMAN IN THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER
HEM HEM SAID THE CLERK BREATHLESSLY AND QUITE EXHAUSTED HE SEATED HIMSELF ON A BANK
THE SUN SHONE GLORIOUSLY KAREN AND THE OLD LADY WALKED ALONG THE PATH THROUGH THE CORN IT WAS RATHER DUSTY THERE AT THE CHURCH DOOR STOOD AN OLD SOLDIER WITH A CRUTCH AND WITH A WONDERFULLY LONG BEARD
HAST SUNG FOR THY CHILD I AM FOND OF THEM I HAVE HEARD THEM BEFORE I AM NIGHT I SAW THY TEARS WHILST THOU SANG'ST THEM
BUT NOW IT WAS ONLY TO THE HOT LANDS THAT A LEARNED MAN HAD COME FROM THE COLD THERE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD RUN ABOUT JUST AS WHEN AT HOME BUT HE SOON FOUND OUT HIS MISTAKE HE
THERE HUNG A BOUQUET OF WITHERED FLOWERS THEY WERE ALMOST FIFTY YEARS OLD THEY LOOKED SO VERY OLD THE PENDULUM OF THE GREAT CLOCK WENT TO AND FRO AND THE HANDS TURNED
AND THE FIRST THING THAT WAS DONE HERE WAS NATURALLY TO PULL OFF THE GALOSHES WHEN THE SPIRIT THAT WAS MERELY GONE OUT ON ADVENTURES MUST HAVE RETURNED WITH THE QUICKNESS OF LIGHTNING TO ITS EARTHLY TENEMENT IT TOOK ITS DIRECTION TOWARDS THE BODY IN A STRAIGHT LINE
THE FAMILY WENT TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD BUT SHE WENT ALONE INTO HER LITTLE CHAMBER THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR A BED AND CHAIR TO STAND IN IT AND HERE SHE SAT DOWN WITH HER PRAYER BOOK
PULLED AT THE SHORT SLEEVES OF HIS JACKET AND SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID HE COULD NOT WALK SO FAST BESIDES HE THOUGHT THAT THE BELL MUST BE LOOKED FOR TO THE RIGHT FOR
NOW ONLY THINK THAT I AM HIS SHADOW IT IS TERRIBLE SAID THE PRINCESS BUT HE IS CONFINED IS HE NOT THAT HE IS I AM AFRAID THAT HE WILL NEVER RECOVER POOR SHADOW SAID THE PRINCESS
AND THEN SAID TO THE CLERGYMAN HERE GIVE ME THE LITTLE GIRL I WILL ADOPT HER AND KAREN BELIEVED ALL THIS HAPPENED ON ACCOUNT OF THE RED SHOES BUT THE OLD LADY THOUGHT THEY WERE HORRIBLE AND THEY WERE BURNT
WHICH OF THEM WAS MY CHILD TELL IT ME SAVE THE INNOCENT SAVE MY CHILD FROM ALL THAT MISERY RATHER TAKE IT AWAY TAKE IT INTO GOD'S KINGDOM FORGET MY TEARS FORGET MY PRAYERS AND ALL THAT I HAVE DONE
IN THE COURSE OF THREE WEEKS HE HAD A VERY FAIR SHADOW WHICH WHEN HE SET OUT FOR HIS HOME IN THE NORTHERN LANDS GREW MORE AND MORE IN THE JOURNEY SO THAT AT LAST IT WAS SO LONG AND SO LARGE
ALL THAT I HAVE IS A FINE GENTLEMAN A BOOT JACK AND A HAIR COMB IF I ONLY HAD THE BARONY DO YOU SEEK MY HAND SAID THE SCISSORS FOR SHE WAS ANGRY
AND RUN AWAY FROM HER SHE NOW LED GERDA INTO THE FLOWER GARDEN OH WHAT ODOUR AND WHAT LOVELINESS WAS THERE EVERY FLOWER THAT ONE COULD THINK OF AND OF EVERY SEASON STOOD THERE IN FULLEST BLOOM
THE OTHER HOWEVER RETAINED SUFFICIENT PRESENCE OF MIND TO WHISPER TO HIM TIS A BET AND I HAVE WON IT BUT THE FIRST THING HE DID AS SOON AS HE GOT HOME WAS TO HAVE A LARGE BLISTER PUT ON HIS CHEST AND BACK TO DRAW OUT HIS MADNESS
AND SO THEY BECAME ACQUAINTANCES AND THEN THEY WERE FRIENDS ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER BUT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE THE LITTLE BOY HEARD HIS PARENTS SAY
THAT DAY PASSED AND THE LITTLE BOY WENT HOME AND THAT WEEK PASSED AND SEVERAL WEEKS TOO THE WINDOWS WERE QUITE FROZEN
THE GREEKS AND ROMANS SAID THE OLD MAN CALLED HER A DRYAD BUT THAT WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE NEW BOOTHS HAVE A MUCH BETTER NAME FOR HER THEY CALL HER OLD GRANNY'
NOW THE QUEEN ONCE TRAVELLED THROUGH THE LAND AND SHE HAD HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WITH HER AND THIS LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS A PRINCESS AND PEOPLE STREAMED TO THE CASTLE AND KAREN WAS THERE ALSO AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS STOOD IN HER FINE WHITE DRESS
I RAN UP AND RAN DOWN PEEPED INTO THE HIGHEST WINDOWS INTO THE SALOONS AND ON THE ROOFS I PEEPED IN WHERE NO ONE COULD PEEP AND I SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD SEE
BUT THE POOR CHILD THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WAS QUITE ASHAMED HE LOOKED AT HIS WOODEN SHOES PULLED AT THE SHORT SLEEVES OF HIS JACKET AND SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID HE COULD NOT WALK SO FAST BESIDES HE THOUGHT THAT THE BELL MUST BE LOOKED FOR TO THE RIGHT
BUT THE COLLAR CAME TO BE JUST THIS VERY PIECE OF WHITE PAPER WE HERE SEE AND ON WHICH THE STORY IS PRINTED AND THAT WAS BECAUSE IT BOASTED SO TERRIBLY AFTERWARDS OF WHAT HAD
THEY POURED OUT THE LIQUOR AND MADE THE MOST FRIENDLY GESTICULATIONS WHILE A COLD PERSPIRATION TRICKLED DOWN THE BACK OF THE POOR COUNCILLOR WHAT'S TO BE THE END OF THIS WHAT'S TO BECOME OF ME
WITH PARENTS AND WITH THE SWEET MATCHLESS CHILDREN I SAW SAID THE SHADOW WHAT NO HUMAN BEING MUST KNOW BUT WHAT THEY WOULD ALL SO WILLINGLY KNOW WHAT IS BAD IN THEIR NEIGHBOR
FOR THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT OLD TIMES YES CAN'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE VERY LITTLE SAID THE OLD SEAMAN AND RAN AND PLAYED ABOUT IT WAS THE VERY SAME COURT YARD WHERE WE NOW ARE AND WE STUCK SLIPS IN THE GROUND AND MADE A GARDEN
WHOLE LIFE'S HISTORY PRINTED ON IT EVEN THE MOST SECRET
FOR ONE MUST HAVE AIR EVEN IF ONE BE ACCUSTOMED TO BE MAHOGANY IT WAS LIVELY BOTH UP AND DOWN THE STREET TAILORS AND SHOEMAKERS AND ALL THE FOLKS MOVED OUT INTO THE STREET CHAIRS AND TABLES WERE BROUGHT FORTH
IT IS CERTAINLY HARD SAID THE SHADOW FOR HE WAS A FAITHFUL SERVANT AND THEN HE GAVE A SORT OF SIGH YOU ARE A NOBLE CHARACTER SAID THE PRINCESS THE WHOLE CITY WAS ILLUMINATED IN THE EVENING
AND SHE HASTENED TOWARDS THE CHURCH DOOR
AND A FEW SECONDS AFTER LIFE BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF IN THE MAN HE ASSERTED THAT THE PRECEDING NIGHT HAD BEEN THE WORST THAT EVER THE MALICE OF FATE HAD ALLOTTED HIM HE WOULD NOT FOR TWO SILVER MARKS AGAIN GO THROUGH WHAT HE HAD ENDURED WHILE MOON STRICKEN BUT NOW HOWEVER IT WAS OVER
SO HIS MOTHER UNDRESSED HIM PUT HIM TO BED AND HAD THE TEA POT BROUGHT IN TO MAKE HIM A GOOD CUP OF ELDERFLOWER TEA JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE MERRY OLD MAN CAME IN WHO LIVED UP A TOP OF THE HOUSE ALL ALONE FOR HE HAD NEITHER WIFE NOR CHILDREN BUT HE LIKED CHILDREN VERY MUCH
BUT THEN HE REMARKED AGAIN THAT THE TONE PROCEEDED NOT FROM THERE BUT FARTHER OFF FROM OUT THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST THE SUN NOW SET THE ATMOSPHERE GLOWED LIKE FIRE
BUT ON LOOKING NEARER ONE SOON SAW THEY COULD SCARCELY BE MERE SERVANTS
YET SUCH WAS THE CASE EVERYBODY LOOKED AT HER FEET AND WHEN SHE STEPPED THROUGH THE CHANCEL DOOR ON THE CHURCH PAVEMENT IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THE OLD FIGURES ON THE TOMBS THOSE PORTRAITS OF OLD PREACHERS AND PREACHERS WIVES
AT THE SAME MOMENT THE BELL SOUNDED DEEP IN THE WOOD SO CLEAR AND SOLEMNLY THAT FIVE OR SIX DETERMINED TO PENETRATE SOMEWHAT FURTHER IT WAS SO
OH THOSE WERE VERY LONG AND DISMAL WINTER EVENINGS AT LAST SPRING CAME WITH ITS WARM SUNSHINE KAY IS DEAD AND GONE SAID LITTLE GERDA THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SAID THE SUNSHINE
THERE GOES THE OLD WASHERWOMAN OVER THE WAY
SHE KISSED THE BOY AND NOW THEY WERE OF THE SAME AGE AND FELT ALIKE HAND IN HAND THEY WENT OUT OF THE BOWER AND THEY WERE STANDING IN THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN OF THEIR HOME NEAR THE GREEN LAWN PAPA'S WALKING STICK WAS TIED
THE LIGHT BURNT IN THE ROOM BEHIND HIM AND THUS IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT HIS SHADOW SHOULD FALL ON HIS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S WALL YES THERE IT SAT DIRECTLY OPPOSITE BETWEEN THE FLOWERS ON THE BALCONY
ON THE VERY DAY HER MOTHER WAS BURIED KAREN RECEIVED THE RED SHOES AND WORE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY WERE CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED FOR MOURNING BUT SHE HAD NO OTHERS
BUT THE ONE DOOR STOOD OPEN DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE OTHER THROUGH A LONG ROW OF ROOMS AND SALOONS AND THERE IT WAS LIGHTED UP I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY KILLED IF I HAD GONE OVER TO THE MAIDEN BUT I WAS CIRCUMSPECT I TOOK TIME TO THINK
EVEN WHEN SHE SHOULD BE OLDER THE NEXT SUNDAY THERE WAS THE SACRAMENT AND KAREN LOOKED AT THE BLACK SHOES LOOKED AT THE RED ONES LOOKED AT THEM AGAIN AND PUT ON THE RED SHOES THE SUN SHONE GLORIOUSLY
THAT WERE SAD INDEED SAID THE BOY AND HE TOOK THE BOW IN HIS HAND AND EXAMINED IT ON EVERY SIDE OH IT IS DRY AGAIN AND IS NOT HURT AT ALL THE STRING IS QUITE TIGHT
I AM FREEZING TO DEATH I SHALL BECOME A LUMP OF ICE
AND WE STUCK SLIPS IN THE GROUND AND MADE A GARDEN I REMEMBER IT WELL SAID THE OLD WOMAN I REMEMBER IT QUITE WELL WE WATERED THE SLIPS AND ONE OF THEM WAS AN ELDERBUSH IT TOOK ROOT PUT FORTH GREEN SHOOTS AND
LED HER INTO THE LITTLE COTTAGE AND LOCKED THE DOOR THE WINDOWS WERE VERY HIGH UP THE GLASS WAS RED BLUE AND GREEN AND THE SUNLIGHT SHONE THROUGH QUITE WONDROUSLY IN ALL SORTS OF COLORS
WE SHALL FLY ABOUT AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER FROM ONE SUCH A STAR TO THE OTHER THAT'S OF COURSE NOT TRUE BUT TWOULD BE PRETTY ENOUGH IF IT WERE SO IF I COULD BUT ONCE TAKE A LEAP UP THERE MY BODY MIGHT STAY HERE ON THE STEPS FOR WHAT I CARE
THE RICH SHOEMAKER IN THE CITY TOOK THE MEASURE OF HER LITTLE FOOT THIS TOOK PLACE AT HIS HOUSE IN HIS ROOM WHERE STOOD LARGE GLASS CASES FILLED WITH ELEGANT SHOES AND BRILLIANT BOOTS
GAVE THE LITTLE TREE ANY PLEASURE IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HARE WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUMP RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE OH THAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY BUT TWO WINTERS WERE PAST AND IN THE THIRD THE TREE WAS SO LARGE THAT THE HARE WAS OBLIGED TO GO ROUND IT
IT HAD SUCH A DELIGHTFUL SMELL THAT IT WAS TO THE PEWTER SOLDIER
YET WE MAY BOLDLY ASSERT THAT THE SOUL IS SHREWDEST WHEN IT SHAKES OFF EVERY FETTER AND EVERY SORT OF LEADING STRING THE BODY ONLY MAKES IT STUPID THE SEEMINGLY DEAD BODY OF THE WATCHMAN WANDERED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE HOSPITAL
THE BOAT DRIFTED WITH THE STREAM LITTLE GERDA SAT QUITE STILL WITHOUT SHOES FOR THEY WERE SWIMMING BEHIND THE BOAT BUT SHE COULD NOT REACH THEM BECAUSE THE BOAT WENT MUCH FASTER THAN THEY DID THE BANKS ON BOTH SIDES WERE BEAUTIFUL LOVELY FLOWERS VENERABLE TREES
THE ENGLISH PIRATES HAD THEY SAID MOST SHAMEFULLY TAKEN THEIR SHIPS WHILE IN THE ROADSTEAD AND THE COUNCILLOR BEFORE WHOSE EYES THE HEROSTRATIC EVENT OF EIGHTEEN O ONE STILL FLOATED VIVIDLY
THAT'S SO STUPID ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET WERE ALSO NEW AND NEAT HOUSES AND THEY THOUGHT JUST AS THE OTHERS DID BUT AT THE WINDOW OPPOSITE THE OLD HOUSE
BUT THE COLLAR THE MOST FOR HE WAS A REAL BOASTER I HAVE HAD SUCH AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF SWEETHEARTS SAID THE COLLAR I COULD NOT BE IN PEACE IT IS TRUE
AND IT IS ABOUT ONE OF THESE COLLARS THAT WE ARE NOW TO HEAR A STORY IT WAS SO OLD
HAD THE WATCH THAT EVENING THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS YET DESPITE THESE TWO OBSTACLES THE YOUNG MAN WAS OBLIGED TO GO OUT IF IT WERE BUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND AS TO TELLING THE DOOR KEEPER ABOUT IT THAT HE THOUGHT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY
AND THE RICH PEOPLE DROVE OUT AND THE POOR WALKED BUT THE WAY SEEMED STRANGELY LONG TO THEM AND WHEN THEY CAME TO A CLUMP OF WILLOWS WHICH GREW ON THE SKIRTS OF THE FOREST THEY SAT DOWN
THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE SITTING NEAREST HIM AND HEARD HIS SPEECH STARED AT HIM IN WONDERMENT AND ONE OF THEM ROSE TOOK OFF HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY AND SAID WITH A SERIOUS COUNTENANCE YOU ARE NO DOUBT A VERY LEARNED MAN MONSIEUR
SAID KAY THAT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN REAL FLOWERS
IT IS ONLY A HUNDRED HUMAN PACES WELL THEN LET HER COME TO HIM SAID THE OLD ONES
AND THOU WILT SEE THEIR WHOLE FUTURE LIFE THEIR WHOLE HUMAN EXISTENCE
THANKEE THANKEE OR CRANKY CRANKY SOUNDED FROM ALL THE FURNITURE
THE SHOES CARRIED HER OVER STACK AND STONE SHE WAS TORN TILL SHE BLED SHE DANCED OVER THE HEATH TILL SHE CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE HERE SHE KNEW DWELT THE EXECUTIONER AND SHE TAPPED WITH HER FINGERS AT THE WINDOW AND SAID
AND WITH STOCKINGLESS FEET SHE FOLLOWED THE POOR STRAW COFFIN IN THEM SUDDENLY A LARGE OLD CARRIAGE DROVE UP AND A LARGE OLD LADY SAT IN IT SHE LOOKED AT THE LITTLE GIRL FELT COMPASSION FOR HER
AND THEN THE PROJECTING WINDOWS STAND SO FAR OUT THAT NO ONE CAN SEE FROM OUR WINDOWS WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT DIRECTION THE STEPS ARE AS BROAD AS THOSE OF A PALACE AND AS HIGH AS TO A CHURCH TOWER
THOU CANST NOT DO ANYTHING AGAINST ME SAID DEATH BUT OUR LORD CAN SAID SHE I ONLY DO HIS BIDDING SAID DEATH I AM HIS GARDENER
AND LITTLE ROSETREES BESIDES THERE WAS A ROSE IN EACH BOX AND THEY GREW SPLENDIDLY THEY NOW THOUGHT OF PLACING THE BOXES ACROSS THE GUTTER SO THAT THEY NEARLY REACHED FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER AND LOOKED JUST LIKE TWO WALLS OF FLOWERS
WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO ASKED THE FIR THEY ARE NOT TALLER THAN I THERE WAS ONE INDEED THAT WAS CONSIDERABLY SHORTER AND WHY DO THEY RETAIN ALL THEIR BRANCHES WHITHER ARE THEY TAKEN
AND AGAIN HE SIGNED TO ME TO STAND BACK IT WAS USELESS TO PERSIST I CROSSED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY AND SOON AFTERWARD LOST SIGHT OF HIM UNDER THE PORTICO OF A HOUSE
IS IT AS SERIOUS AS THAT GEORGE
A LAST APPEARANCE OF TRIM TOOK PLACE A LAST ADVANCE A LAST CAUTIOUS PAUSE WAS MADE BY THE DUCKS THE BAILIFF TOUCHED THE STRINGS THE WEIGHED NET WORK FELL VERTICALLY INTO THE WATER
AND YET I WAS NOT SENSIBLE OF ANY PAIN IT SEEMED AS IF I WERE SURROUNDED AND ENWRAPPED IN SOME ELECTRIC ATMOSPHERE WHICH ALTERED ALL THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF SENSATION
LITTLE BY LITTLE SHE REGARDED ME WITH THE SADDEST LOOK OF CONFUSION AND DISTRESS PUTTING THE LETTER DOWN BEFORE ME ON THE TABLE SHE SAID TIMIDLY WOULD YOU MIND ADDING A POSTSCRIPT SIR
I HAVE A BUSINESS APPOINTMENT HE SAID WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT OFF PRAY EXCUSE ME MISSUS VAN BRANDT WILL DO THE HONORS GOOD MORNING THE HOUSE DOOR OPENED AND CLOSED AGAIN THE RUSTLING OF THE DRESS CAME SLOWLY NEARER AND NEARER
ON WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO RECORD HER ENGAGEMENTS WRITE DOWN THE NAME AND ADDRESS SHE SAID RESIGNEDLY I WILL GO WITH YOU I ANSWERED AND WAIT IN THE CARRIAGE AT THE DOOR
AND SEATED MYSELF BY HER SIDE SHE REMOVED HER HANDS FROM HER FACE WHEN SHE FELT ME NEAR HER SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A COLD AND STEADY SURPRISE
AFTER THE EFFORT THAT IT HAS MADE MY OBSERVATION IS LEFT FREE TO EXERT ITSELF AS USUAL LITTLE BY LITTLE WHILE THE TALK GOES ON
MISTER AND MISSUS GERMAINE LEFT IT TO US TO DECIDE WHETHER WE SHOULD CONTINUE OUR FRIENDLY INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR NOT AT THREE O'CLOCK P M
AND HAVE YOU NOT CONCEALED IT FROM HER FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL ME THE TRUTH I CAN BEAR IT THE GREAT MAN TOOK ME KINDLY BY THE HAND YOUR MOTHER STANDS IN NO NEED OF ANY WARNING
AND I KNOW HER TO BE LIVING I WROTE TO YOU THAT I WAS BENEATH YOUR NOTICE AND YOU HAVE OBLIGED ME TO TELL YOU WHY AM I SUFFICIENTLY DEGRADED TO BRING YOU TO YOUR SENSES I DREW CLOSER TO HER
WAS TO CONCILIATE THE FELLOW BEFORE I LEFT THE HOUSE I AM SORRY NOT TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION I SAID AS WE WALKED TOGETHER TO THE DOOR PERHAPS YOU WILL GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE HIS EYES TWINKLED CUNNINGLY
I MUST SAY GOOD BY MY HUSBAND SENDS TO YOU BOTH HIS KINDEST REGARDS AND BEST WISHES HIS MANUSCRIPT WILL BE QUITE SAFE WHEN YOU LEAVE LONDON
WHERE THE GROUND ROSE A LITTLE SOME MOLDERING FRAGMENTS OF BRICKWORK LOOKING ONWARD AS I REACHED THE MIDDLE OF THE MEADOW I PERCEIVED ON ITS FURTHER SIDE TOWERING GAUNT
AND THREW THE LETTER THAT I HAD GIVEN TO HER INDIGNANTLY AT MY FEET HOW DARE YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME HOW DARE YOU TOUCH ME SHE SAID TAKE YOUR LETTER BACK SIR I REFUSE TO RECEIVE IT
HE SIMPLY SAYS NO TO EVERYTHING THAT I CAN SUGGEST YOU HAVE HEARD FROM HIS OWN LIPS THAT HE HAS NO DEFINITE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE WHAT IS TO BECOME OF HIM WHAT HAD WE BETTER DO
DO YOU MEAN GEORGE THAT YOU HAVE OFFERED HER MARRIAGE YES AND SHE HAS SAID NO SHE HAS SAID NO BECAUSE THERE IS SOME OBSTACLE IN HER WAY
OF WHICH I WAS ASHAMED THOUGH NOBODY WAS NEAR TO SEE THEM FILLED MY EYES WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE MONTHS THAT HAD PASSED SINCE WE HAD LAST LOOKED ON ONE ANOTHER AND OF ALL THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SUFFERED MUST HAVE SUFFERED
I INWARDLY DETERMINE TO DISCOVER THE TRUE MOTIVE FOR THE DOCTOR'S PRESENCE THAT EVENING AND FOR THE PART THAT SIR JAMES HAS TAKEN IN INVITING HIM TO BE MY GUEST
WHEN THEIR DEPARTURE LEFT THE SCENE FREE FOR THE RETURN OF MY NURSE IN TWO DAYS MORE THE GOVERNMENT VESSEL WAS TO SAIL ON THE RETURN VOYAGE MY WRIST WAS STILL PAINFUL WHEN I TRIED TO USE IT
SHE STARTED TO HER FEET AND LOOKED ROUND HER INCREDULOUSLY AS IF DOUBTING WHETHER SHE HAD RIGHTLY HEARD AND RIGHTLY INTERPRETED MY LAST WORDS BEFORE I COULD SPEAK AGAIN SHE SUDDENLY FACED ME
THE NIGHT PORTER AT THE HOTEL IS SLUMBERING IN HIS CHAIR HE WAKES AS I PASS HIM AND GOD HELP ME HE TOO LOOKS AS IF HE THOUGHT
I TASTED ONCE MORE THE MOMENTARY RAPTURE OF OUR LAST KISS I FELT ONCE MORE THE PANG OF SORROW THAT WRUNG ME WHEN I HAD PARTED WITH HER AND FOUND MYSELF ALONE IN THE STREET TEARS
LOOK AT ME I PLEADED AND TELL ME THE TRUTH CAN YOU SEE ME CAN YOU HEAR ME AND DO YOU FEEL NO ANSWERING SYMPATHY IN YOUR OWN HEART DO YOU REALLY CARE NOTHING FOR ME
I CALLED OUT UNDER THE WINDOW MISTER GERMAINE
I LEFT HER PALE AND SAD WITH MY LETTER IN HER HAND
AFTER ONE SHARP GLANCE AT ME THE LANDLADY APPEARED TO BE SATISFIED THAT SHE WAS DEALING WITH A GENTLEMAN SHE LED THE WAY INTO A SORT OF PARLOR BEHIND THE BAR PLACED WRITING MATERIALS ON THE TABLE LOOKED AT MY COMPANION
CAN I LOOK AGAIN AT THE BAILIFF'S COTTAGE WITHOUT THE ONE MEMORIAL OF LITTLE MARY THAT I POSSESS BESIDES HAVE I NOT PROMISED MISS DUNROSS THAT MARY'S GIFT SHALL ALWAYS GO WITH ME WHEREVER I GO
I ACCEPTED MY INVITATION AND LEFT THE HOUSE WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT FAREWELL KISS THAT SUDDEN COMPOSURE WHEN THE DAY OF THE DINNER WAS FIXED WEIGHED ON MY SPIRITS
WHAT WAS THE SECRET OF HER POWER OVER ME WHAT EMOTION WHAT PASSION HAD SHE AWAKENED IN ME WAS IT LOVE NO
YOU HAVE BEEN FORCED INTO YOUR PRESENT POSITION THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EXCUSE YOU AND WHICH YOU ARE PURPOSELY KEEPING BACK FROM ME NOTHING WILL CONVINCE ME THAT YOU ARE A BASE WOMAN SHOULD I LOVE YOU AS I LOVE YOU
AS ONLY ONE WOMAN CAN LOOK AT ANOTHER UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND LEFT US BY OURSELVES IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER BEEN IN A ROOM WITH HER ALONE THE EMBARRASSING SENSE OF HER POSITION
EVEN AS SHE MADE IT HER HAND CLOSED ON MINE A LOW SIGH FLUTTERED ON HER LIPS SHE ANSWERED WITH A SUDDEN SELF ABANDONMENT SHE RECKLESSLY CAST HERSELF LOOSE FROM THE RESTRAINTS
PALACES OF THE PROUDEST NOBLES OF NORTH HOLLAND I WAS ACTUALLY STANDING ON WHAT HAD BEEN FORMERLY THE WEALTHY QUARTER OF ENKHUIZEN AND WHAT WAS LEFT OF IT NOW
THAT I LOST ALL CONTROL OVER MYSELF THE OLD TIME ON THE BANKS OF THE LAKE CAME BACK TO ME MY HEART HUNGERED FOR ITS DARLING OF HAPPIER DAYS
PERHAPS ONLY TO FIND THAT I HAD LOST THE WOMAN WHOM
YOUR HAPPINESS IS MY FIRST CONSIDERATION AND THE WOMAN YOU LOVE SADLY AS SHE HAS BEEN LED ASTRAY IS A WOMAN WORTHY OF A BETTER FATE MARRY HER I COULD NOT TRUST MYSELF TO SPEAK
WITH NO DISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHAT THE OBJECTS WERE ON WHICH MY EYES RESTED MY HANDS WERE COLD AND YET I HARDLY FELT IT MY HEAD THROBBED HOTLY
I DECLINE TO BE MADE THE OBJECT OF ANY FURTHER MEDICAL INQUIRIES AS TO THE STATE OF MY MIND IN DUE COURSE OF TIME WHEN MY PLANS ARE SETTLED HE WILL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN MEANWHILE
HAVE YOU NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF ME IN ALL THE TIME THAT HAS PASSED SINCE WE LAST MET I SPOKE AS I FELT FERVENTLY PASSIONATELY SHE MADE A LAST EFFORT TO REPEL ME AND YIELDED
ON THE BOUNDARY LIMIT WHERE THE LIGHT WAS CROSSED BY THE OBSCURITY WHICH FILLED THE REST OF THE ROOM I SAW MISS DUNROSS SEATED WITH HER VEIL DRAWN AND HER WRITING CASE ON HER KNEE WAITING MY RETURN
WHY NOT YOU KNOW NOTHING OF ME SURELY YOU OUGHT NOT TO RECOMMEND A PERSON WHO IS A STRANGER TO YOU AND I AM WORSE THAN A STRANGER I AM A MISERABLE WRETCH WHO HAS TRIED TO COMMIT A GREAT SIN
APART ALTOGETHER FROM ITS HISTORY STRUCK ME WITH A FEELING OF HORROR MY MIND SEEMED TO LOSE ITS BALANCE IN THE DREADFUL STILLNESS THAT WAS ROUND ME
AND TRIED TO WARM MYSELF OUR POSITIONS IN THE ROOM LEFT SOME LITTLE DISTANCE BETWEEN US I COULD ONLY SEE HER SIDEWISE AS SHE SAT BY THE WINDOW IN THE SHELTERING DARKNESS OF THE CURTAIN WHICH STILL REMAINED DRAWN
FORCED ON HER INNER KNOWLEDGE SOME DEEPLY SEATED FEELING WHICH SHE HAD THUS FAR RESOLUTELY IGNORED I LOOKED BACK THROUGH THE DAYS OF MY SOJOURN IN THE HOUSE
WHICH MISS DUNROSS WAS TO WRITE TO MY GREAT SURPRISE I FOUND IT SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIX MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT TRY AS I MIGHT MY THOUGHTS PERSISTED IN WANDERING FROM THE LETTER TO MY MOTHER
PLANTED MOTIONLESS ON THE BANK BY TWOS AND THREES THE MAIN BODY OF THE WATERFOWL GRADUALLY FOLLOWED THE ADVANCED GUARD SWIMMING NEARER AND NEARER TO THE DOG THE WARY DUCKS SUDDENLY CAME TO A HALT AND
I WILL TELL YOUR MOTHER WHAT THE OBSTACLE IS SHE SAID THOUGHTFULLY WHEN TO MORROW AT THIS TIME SHE RAISED HERSELF ON HER KNEES THE TEARS SUDDENLY FILLED HER EYES SHE DREW ME TO HER GENTLY
GOD KNOWS AT WHAT COST OF MISERY TO MYSELF REFUSED TO BE HIS WIFE IT WAS ONLY WHEN MY POOR LITTLE GREEN FLAG HAD REVEALED US TO EACH OTHER
HE NEED FEEL NO ANXIETY ABOUT MY SAFETY
WAS MATCHED BY AN EQUALLY STRANGE CONDITION OF MY BODY A MYSTERIOUS TREMBLING SHUDDERED OVER ME FAINTLY FROM HEAD TO FOOT I WALKED WITHOUT FEELING THE GROUND AS I TROD ON IT I LOOKED ABOUT ME
IT WAS INNOCENTLY SAID ON HER SIDE IT WAS INNOCENTLY DONE ON MINE THE GOOD EASY BAILIFF LOOKING ASIDE AT THE MOMENT FROM HIS DUCKS DISCOVERED US PURSUING OUR BOY AND GIRL COURTSHIP
IN THAT TIME HUNDREDS ON HUNDREDS OF MILES WERE BETWEEN US AND YET SHE WAS NOW AS NEAR ME AS IF SHE WERE WALKING IN THE GARDEN BY MY SIDE THIS STRANGE CONDITION OF MY MIND
AT YOUR OWN TIME IN THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER PERSON IF YOU LIKE I WILL WRITE TO YOU SHE SAID TO MORROW TO MORROW I TOOK UP THE LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION FROM THE FLOOR
I TOOK IT REMINDING HER THAT SHE HAD HERSELF PROPOSED WRITING TO ME WHEN WE MET THAT EVENING I SUGGESTED THAT SHE SHOULD WAIT TO TELL THE SAD STORY OF HER TROUBLES UNTIL IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HER TO SEND ME THE NARRATIVE IN THE FORM OF A LETTER
LITTLE MARY LAID HER HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND RAISING HERSELF ON TIPTOE WHISPERED IN MY EAR GEORGE COME HOME WITH ME I HAVE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU THAT IS BETTER WORTH SEEING THAN THE DUCKS WHAT IS IT
AND PACK A TRAVELING BAG WITH THE FEW THINGS THAT I CAN CARRY WITH ME MY MONEY IS IN MY DRESSING CASE OPENING IT I DISCOVER MY PRETTY KEEPSAKE THE GREEN FLAG CAN I RETURN TO GREENWATER BROAD
AT SIR JAMES'S SUGGESTION HOWEVER ONE VISITOR AT THE HOTEL HAS BEEN ASKED TO DINE WITH US WHO CLAIMS DISTINCTION AS NO ORDINARY GUEST THE PHYSICIAN WHO FIRST WARNED ME OF THE CRITICAL STATE OF MY MOTHER'S HEALTH
IF I RESTED FOR ONE NIGHT AT A FARM HALF WAY BETWEEN THE TOWN AND MISTER DUNROSS'S HOUSE KNOWING THIS I HAD NEVERTHELESS LEFT THE QUESTION OF REJOINING THE VESSEL UNDECIDED TO THE VERY LATEST MOMENT
IF MISS DUNROSS WANTED ME THE GARDEN WAS A WILD PLACE TO MY SOUTHERN NOTIONS BUT IT EXTENDED FOR SOME DISTANCE ALONG THE SHORE OF THE ISLAND AND IT OFFERED SOME PLEASANT VIEWS OF THE LAKE
IN WHICH A LIGHT DIMLY APPEARED MY GUIDE SAID IN DUTCH OFFICE OF VAN BRANDT SIR BOWED AND LEFT ME
THE LANDLADY APPEARED AS SHE MADE THE OBJECTION RECKLESS WHAT I SAID OR WHAT I DID I INTRODUCED MYSELF AS HER RELATIVE AND ASKED TO BE SHOWN INTO A QUIET ROOM IN WHICH I COULD WRITE A LETTER
AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN HIS PATIENTS LEAVE HIM FREE TO VISIT HIS FRIENDS THE DINNER IS NEARLY AT AN END
WITHOUT MAKING THE SLIGHTEST FUSS ABOUT IT MY WIFE AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WHEN WE HAD READ MISSUS GERMAINE'S LETTER LONDON IS DULL I REMARKED AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT CAME OF IT MY WIFE
PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD ONE OF US WAS A LADY AGED TEN AND THE OTHER WAS A GENTLEMAN AGED THIRTEEN
YES SHE SAT DOWN BY THE TABLE AND LEANING HER ARMS ON IT COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS MY ANSWERS SEEMED NOT ONLY TO HAVE DISTRESSED BUT TO HAVE PERPLEXED HER
THE UNACKNOWLEDGED TROUBLES OF LIFE ARE GENERALLY
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN TWELVE YEARS OF MY LIFE TO HAVE ANNIHILATED THE NEXT TWELVE HOURS IN THIS FRAME OF MIND I REACHED HOME AND PRESENTED MYSELF IN MY MOTHER'S SITTING ROOM
SHE LOOKED AT ME WILDLY WITH A CRY OF TERROR SHE SAW MY RESOLUTION IN MY FACE DON'T FRIGHTEN ME SHE SAID LET ME THINK SHE REFLECTED FOR A MOMENT HER EYES BRIGHTENED AS IF SOME NEW WAY
I DON'T BELIEVE THE MAN LIVES WHO COULD HAVE RESISTED HER AT THAT MOMENT I LOST ALL POWER OF RESTRAINT I CAUGHT HER IN MY ARMS I WHISPERED I LOVE YOU I KISSED HER PASSIONATELY
WHICH WOULD RESTORE TO LIBERTY THE MAN WHO WAS THE ONE OBSTACLE TO MY MARRIAGE AND THIS WAS THE TIME THAT MY MOTHER HAD INNOCENTLY CHOSEN FOR CONSENTING TO RECEIVE AS HER DAUGHTER IN LAW MISSUS VAN BRANDT
INSTEAD OF TURNING IT TOWARD ME AS USUAL WHILE WE WERE TALKING I STILL FELT THE MYSTERIOUS TREMBLING WHICH HAD OPPRESSED ME IN THE GARDEN DRAWING A CHAIR NEAR THE FIRE I STIRRED THE EMBERS TOGETHER
AND YOU ACCEPT AS YOUR ACCOMPLICE MISTER VAN BRANDT OH SIR I HAVE ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO LOOK UP TO YOU AS A HIGH MINDED MAN HOW BITTERLY YOU HAVE DISAPPOINTED ME HER REPROACHES PASSED BY ME UNHEEDED
I SHALL TELL HIM THE TRUTH I SHALL SAY I AM GOING TO MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER THE BAILIFF BURST OUT LAUGHING AND LOOKED BACK AGAIN AT HIS DUCKS WELL WELL
KISS ME SHE WHISPERED YOU WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN KISS ME FOR THE LAST TIME MY LIPS HAD BARELY TOUCHED HERS WHEN SHE STARTED TO HER FEET AND SNATCHED UP MY HAT FROM THE CHAIR ON WHICH I HAD PLACED IT
I DETERMINE TO LEAVE THE HOTEL PRIVATELY THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE SIR JAMES IS OUT OF HIS BEDROOM TO WHAT DESTINATION I AM TO BETAKE MYSELF IS NATURALLY THE NEXT QUESTION THAT ARISES AND THIS
I COULD ONLY KNEEL AT MY MOTHER'S FEET AND HIDE MY FACE ON HER KNEES AS IF I HAD BEEN A BOY AGAIN THINK OF IT GEORGE SHE SAID AND COME BACK TO ME WHEN YOU ARE COMPOSED ENOUGH TO SPEAK AS QUIETLY OF THE FUTURE AS I DO
SHE HAS DIED IN MY ARMS HER LAST WORDS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN TO ME HER LAST LOOK ON EARTH HAS BEEN MINE I AM NOW IN THE SADDEST AND PLAINEST MEANING OF THE WORDS ALONE IN THE WORLD
A FEW MOUNDS OF BROKEN BRICKS A PASTURE LAND OF SWEET SMELLING GRASS AND A LITTLE FLOCK OF SHEEP SLEEPING THE MERE DESOLATION OF THE VIEW
THE DAY DREW TO ITS END AND STILL SHE NEVER APPEARED I LEFT MY ROOM TO ENJOY THE LAST SUNNY GLEAM OF THE DAYLIGHT IN THE GARDEN ATTACHED TO THE HOUSE FIRST TELLING PETER WHERE I MIGHT BE FOUND
YOU TALKED OF TRAVELING ON THE CONTINENT WHEN YOU DINED WITH US IF YOU SHOULD WANDER OUR WAY THE ENGLISH CONSUL AT NAPLES IS A FRIEND OF MY HUSBAND'S AND
I TOLD HIM NOT TO HURRY YOUR RETURN TO THE HOUSE HAVE YOU ENJOYED YOUR WALK SHE SPOKE VERY QUIETLY THE FAINT SAD VOICE WAS FAINTER AND SADDER THAN EVER SHE KEPT HER HEAD BENT OVER HER WRITING CASE
WOULD HAVE FAILED TO POSSESS THEMSELVES IN SO MANY YEARS I REMEMBERED TO MY SHAME THAT MY MOTHER HAD BUT SELDOM OCCUPIED MY THOUGHTS EVEN THE IMAGE OF MISSUS VAN BRANDT EXCEPT WHEN THE CONVERSATION HAD TURNED ON HER
LET ME UNDERSTAND FIRST WHAT THE SACRIFICE MEANS DOES MISS WESTERFIELD MAKE ANY CONDITIONS
I AM HIS ELDER BROTHER IGNORANT ON HIS PART OF THE FAMILY DISGRACE BENNYDECK HEARD THAT REPLY WITH AMAZEMENT FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW
THE DOLL WAS PUT INTO THE PERAMBULATOR AND WAS WHEELED ABOUT THE ROOM WHILE MISSUS LINLEY MOVED THE CHAIRS OUT OF THE WAY AND RANDAL ATTENDED WITH THE OPEN PARASOL UNDER ORDERS TO PRETEND THAT THE SUN WAS SHINING
HER DESPAIR FORCED ITS WAY TO EXPRESSION IN WORDS I WISH I COULD FORGET YOU SHE ANSWERED IN RECKLESS WRETCHEDNESS THE CHILD WAS STILL TOO DROWSY TO HEAR PLAINLY
ON THE POINT OF REMOVING THE LETTERS NEXT SHE NOTICED THE NEWSPAPER ON THE TABLE ANYTHING INTERESTING TO DAY SHE ASKED AND DREW THE NEWSPAPER TOWARD HER TO LOOK AT IT HE TOOK IT FROM HER SUDDENLY ALMOST ROUGHLY
AND THE ORDEAL OF CONFESSION TO HIS WIFE AS YET HE HAD FAILED TO FIND THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING TO SYDNEY THE ONLY WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT HE COULD ALLOW TO PASS HIS LIPS
WILL THEY BE LONG DO YOU THINK BEFORE THEY COME SHE ASKED
A PRETTY LITTLE IMITATION OF A JEWELER'S CASKET AT KITTY'S SIDE AND DREW BACK BEFORE THE CHILD COULD LOOK AT HER MISSUS PRESTY WAS THE ONLY PERSON PRESENT WHO NOTICED HER PALE FACE
A VIEW OF A LOW BROWN OBJECT IN THE DISTANCE SAID TO BE THE CONVENT IN WHICH THE NUNS LIVED SECLUDED FROM MORTAL EYES AT ONE SIDE OF THE HOTEL THE WINDOWS LOOKED ON A LITTLE WOODEN PIER SADLY IN WANT OF REPAIR
PERHAPS THE REPORT IS NOT TRUE AS YOU DON'T READ THE NEWSPAPERS ALLOW ME TO REPEAT IT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO MARRY THE BEAUTIFUL WIDOW MISSUS NORMAN
INSTEAD OF THE BACK HER LONGING EYES STOLE A LAST LOOK AT HIM A FRENZY SEIZED HER SHE PRESSED HER LIPS TO THE PHOTOGRAPH IN A PASSION OF HOPELESS LOVE WHAT DOES IT MATTER SHE ASKED HERSELF
THE LINES OF PRINT WERE BEGINNING TO MINGLE AND GROW DIM WHEN SHE WAS STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN OPENING OF THE DOOR
A MOTHER LIVING THE OLD LADY HAS BEEN TWICE MARRIED HER NAME IS MISSUS PRESTY THIS SETTLED THE QUESTION
HERBERT DECLINED TO SAY WHETHER HE WOULD BE CAREFUL OR NOT HE WAS DETERMINED TO FIND OUT FIRST WITH WHAT PURPOSE BENNYDECK HAD ENTERED THE ROOM
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN THE GIRL PAUSED AND LOOKED CONFUSED MISSUS LINLEY TRIED TO TELL HER TO GO ON THE WORDS WERE IN HER MIND BUT THE CAPACITY OF GIVING EXPRESSION TO THEM FAILED HER
WOULD THE END HAVE BEEN BUT SHE HAD THUS FAR ESCAPED THE DANGER OF EXCITING HIS DISTRUST THAT SHE LOVED HIM HE KNEW
WHICH I MYSELF CAN ESTABLISH AND DIRECT IF I DIE FIRST OH THERE IS A CHANCE OF IT WE MAY HAVE A NAVAL WAR PERHAPS OR I MAY TURN OUT ONE OF THOSE INCORRIGIBLE MADMEN WHO RISK THEIR LIVES IN ARCTIC EXPLORATION IN CASE OF THE WORST THEREFORE
YOU HAVE ALWAYS LIVED AMONG LADIES SURELY YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT A WIFE IN MY POSITION WHO RESPECTS HERSELF RESTRAINS HERSELF
WHEN MY HOUSEHOLD BUSINESS IS OFF MY MIND I SHALL HOPE TO FIND YOU BOTH MORE POLITE TO EACH OTHER THAN EVER WHEN I COME BACK SHE WAS IN SUCH A FRENZY OF SUPPRESSED RAGE
WHEN I GOT BACK TO ENGLAND MISERABLE NEWS WAS WAITING FOR ME I HEARD OF YOUR FATHER'S DEATH AND OF THAT SHAMEFUL TRIAL POOR FELLOW HE WAS AS INNOCENT SYDNEY AS YOU ARE OF THE OFFENSE WHICH HE WAS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING
WHERE WAS THE GENEROUS GRANDMOTHER'S GIFT NOBODY REMEMBERED IT MISSUS PRESTY HERSELF DISCOVERED THE INESTIMABLE SIXPENNY PICTURE BOOK CAST AWAY AND FORGOTTEN ON A DISTANT WINDOW SEAT
AND THAT ONE OF US WAS A LADY IN DELICATE HEALTH THIS SWEETEST OF MEN
IT SHOULD BE HER OWN ACT THAT PARTED THEM AND THAT DID IT AT ONCE SHE THREW OPEN THE DOOR AND HURRIED HALF WAY DOWN THE STAIRS BEFORE SHE REMEMBERED THE ONE TERRIBLE OBSTACLE IN HER WAY THE DIVORCE SLOWLY AND SADLY SHE SUBMITTED AND WENT BACK TO HER ROOM
THE SUN WAS SHINING THE FLOWERS WERE IN THEIR BRIGHTEST BEAUTY AND THE DOLL HAD NOT YET BEEN TAKEN INTO THE GARDEN KITTY AT ONCE LED THE WAY OUT SO COMPLETELY PREOCCUPIED
MY INDISCRETION HAS DESERVED IT I OUGHT TO HAVE PRODUCED MY PROOFS AND HAVE LEFT IT TO YOU TO DRAW THE CONCLUSION SIT DOWN IF YOU PLEASE I WON'T DETAIN YOU FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES
I SAY IT IN NO UNKINDNESS TO YOU SHE RESUMED BUT WHEN YOU ASK ME TO FORGIVE CONSIDER WHAT YOU ASK ME TO FORGET IT WILL ONLY DISTRESS US BOTH IF WE REMAIN LONGER TOGETHER SHE CONTINUED RISING AS SHE SPOKE
HE REPLIED UNITE THE FATHER AND CHILD
I'M NOTHING BUT THE IGNORANT OBJECT OF HIS KINDNESS THE POOR FOOL WHO COULD SEE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GRATITUDE AND LOVE WHERE IS THE HARM OF HAVING HIM WITH ME WHEN I AM STARVING IN THE STREETS
THE CHILD RAN INTO THE ROOM IN SEARCH OF HER MOTHER THERE WAS A LOW MURMUR OF HORROR AT THE SIGHT OF HER THAT INNOCENT HEART THEY HAD ALL HOPED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED THE MISERY OF THE PARTING SCENE
AT THE SAME MOMENT RANDAL SEIZED HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING
KITTY'S GRANDMOTHER DISAPPROVED OF SPENDING MONEY LAVISHLY ON BIRTHDAY GIFTS TO CHILDREN SHOW IT OF COURSE AND TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF IT MISSUS PRESTY ANSWERED GRAVELY BUT TELL ME ONE THING MY DEAR
BUT IF MY BROTHER IS LEFT UNDER THE FALSE IMPRESSION THAT YOUR ENGAGEMENT WILL BE FOLLOWED BY YOUR MARRIAGE HE WILL REFUSE TO INTRUDE HIMSELF ON THE LADY WHO WAS ONCE HIS WIFE THE CAPTAIN UNDERSTOOD SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE ABOUT ME
WHY COMPARING MISSUS LINLEY'S PROSPECTS WITH HERS WAS THERE ANYTHING TO JUSTIFY REGRET FOR THE DIVORCED WIFE SHE HAD HER SWEET LITTLE CHILD TO MAKE HER HAPPY SHE HAD A FORTUNE OF HER OWN TO LIFT HER ABOVE SORDID CARES
MISSUS LINLEY ADDRESSED HERSELF TO HER MOTHER WHEN WE LAST MET I THOUGHT YOU SPOKE RASHLY AND CRUELLY I KNOW NOW THAT THERE WAS TRUTH SOME TRUTH LET ME SAY
MISSUS PRESTY INTERPOSED MY DEAR CATHERINE
THE ONE BEST WAY OF TELLING SYDNEY HOW DEAR SHE WAS TO HIM ALREADY FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE WOULD BE TO ANSWER HER IN PERSON HE HURRIED AWAY TO LONDON BY THE FIRST TRAIN
IF I HAD NOT LEFT HIM OF MY OWN FREE WILL SHE SAID WHAT ELSE WOULD EXCUSE ME FOR VENTURING TO COME HERE CATHERINE'S SENSE OF JUSTICE FELT THE FORCE OF THAT REPLY AT THE SAME TIME HER SENSE OF INJURY
NO HONEST EMPLOYMENT WOULD BE BENEATH MY NOTICE BESIDES IF I WENT TO AMERICA I MIGHT MEET WITH MY BROTHER MY DEAR CHILD AFTER THE TIME THAT HAS PASSED THERE IS NO IMAGINABLE CHANCE OF YOUR MEETING WITH YOUR BROTHER
MY IDEA IS TO INVEST IT IN THE FUNDS AND TO LET IT THRIVE AT INTEREST UNTIL I GROW OLDER AND RETIRE PERHAPS FROM SERVICE IN THE NAVY
TO HER DISMAY HE REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND WORSE STILL HE NOTICED HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENCE AND ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY SERIOUS CAUSE FOR IT FOR THE MOMENT
THEY WERE AFRAID TO ANSWER HER WITH ALL HER LITTLE STRENGTH SHE CLASPED HER BELOVED FRIEND AND PLAY FELLOW ROUND THE WAIST MY OWN DEAR YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE ME
RESIGNED TO ONE MORE SACRIFICE SHE TOOK THE CARD IN BOTH HANDS TO TEAR IT UP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SCATTERED IN PIECES ON THE FLOOR BUT FOR THE CHANCE WHICH HAD TURNED THE PORTRAIT SIDE OF THE CARD TOWARD HER
I'M SO EXCITED MAMMA ABOUT WHAT KITTY ABOUT MY DINNER PARTY TO MORROW OH SAID THE CHILD CLASPING HER HANDS EARNESTLY AS SHE THOUGHT OF HER PLAYFELLOWS
THEY WERE BOTH SILENT KITTY'S VOICE WAS AUDIBLE ON THE STAIRS THAT LED TO THE PICTURE GALLERY DISPUTING WITH THE MAID NEITHER HER FATHER NOR HER MOTHER HEARD HER MISS WESTERFIELD IS INNOCENT OF HAVING WRONGED ME
THOSE FEW IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY WERE MEN ONE OF THE FAITHFUL COMPANIONS
RICH MISSUS ROMSEY CONNECTED WITH COMMERCE AS WIFE OF THE CHIEF PARTNER IN THE FIRM OF ROMSEY AND RENSHAW WAS STAYING AT THE HOTEL IN THE INTERESTS OF HER THREE CHILDREN THEY WERE OF DELICATE CONSTITUTION
I HAVE INTERRUPTED A CONFIDENTIAL INTERVIEW HE BEGAN AND I OUGHT PERHAPS TO EXPLAIN MISSUS PRESTY LISTENED ABSENTLY PREOCCUPIED BY THE FEAR THAT HERBERT WOULD PROVOKE A DANGEROUS DISCLOSURE
THE REPLY ONLY INCREASED HIS PERPLEXITY OBSERVE MISS WESTERFIELD AND YOUR BROTHER LOOK AT THEM NOW RANDAL OBEYED WHAT IS THERE TO LOOK AT HE INQUIRED CAN'T YOU SEE
HE HAD DESERVED IT THE CLOCK ROUSED HIM STRIKING THE HOUR
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO INSIST ON AN EXPLANATION FROM MY MOTHER SHE PROCEEDED NO MATTER WHAT I MAY FEEL I MUST REMEMBER THAT SHE IS MY MOTHER I ASK YOU AGAIN
THE CHILD REMINDED HER OF THE LIVING FATHER STILL THE CHILD INNOCENTLY TORTURED HER WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF DECEIT THE FAITHLESS MAN FROM WHOM THE LAW HAD RELEASED HER
HAD CERTAIN ENDS TO GAIN IN PUTTING THIS IDEA INTO THE CHILD'S HEAD IT WAS HER SPECIAL OBJECT TO RAISE DOMESTIC OBSTACLES TO A PRIVATE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE HUSBAND AND WIFE DURING THE EARLIER HOURS OF THE DAY
HAVE YOU PERVERTED HER GRATITUDE AND LED HER BLINDFOLD TO LOVE CRUEL
THEIR COMPLETE RECOVERY AFTER SEVERE ILLNESS WHICH HAD PASSED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WAS LESS SPEEDY THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED AND THE DOCTOR HAD DECLARED THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS IN EACH CASE MORE OR LESS IN NEED OF REPAIR
YES MA'AM WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM IN THE SHRUBBERY DID YOUR MASTER SAY ANYTHING I SLIPPED AWAY MA'AM BEFORE HE SAW ME WHY MISS WESTERFIELD WAS IN THE SHRUBBERY WITH MY MASTER
AND GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD HELPLESS AND FRIENDLESS YES EVEN UNDER THE TERRIBLE TRIAL THAT WRUNG HER THE NOBILITY OF THE WOMAN'S NATURE SPOKE IN HER NEXT WORDS
RANDAL LINLEY HAD SAID TO MISSUS PRESTY
THE MAGISTRATE QUESTIONED HIM AND BROUGHT TO LIGHT A REALLY HEART BREAKING ACCOUNT OF MISFORTUNE
IN THE CORRIDOR SHE HEARD LINLEY'S VOICE ON THE LOWER FLOOR HE WAS ASKING ONE OF THE SERVANTS IF MISS WESTERFIELD WAS IN THE HOUSE OR IN THE GARDEN HER FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO ADVANCE TO THE STAIRS
THAT STILL LIVED IN IT SPOKE IN ACCENTS THAT EVEN TOUCHED THE SERVANT SHE CAME BACK REMEMBERING THE HAPPY DAYS WHEN THE GOVERNESS HAD WON THEIR HEARTS AT MOUNT MORVEN AND FOR A MOMENT AT LEAST
HE WAS VERY GRATEFUL AND CAME NOW AND THEN TO THANK ME
KEPT A MORSEL OF PAPER IN ITS PLACE ON WHICH SHE HAD WRITTEN A FEW PENITENT WORDS OF FAREWELL ADDRESSED TO MISSUS LINLEY
AND MISSUS ROMSEY AND INQUIRE IF ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED TO CAUSE THE DELAY AS SHE TOLD KITTY TO RING THE BELL THE WAITER CAME IN WITH TWO LETTERS ADDRESSED TO MISSUS NORMAN MISSUS PRESTY HAD HER OWN IDEAS AND DREW HER OWN CONCLUSIONS
SHE HAD SET HIM THE RIGHT EXAMPLE
NO EXCUSES I SHALL SEND A NOTE AND TELL MISSUS NORMAN WHY SHE DOESN'T SEE MY BOYS TO MORROW ISN'T THAT A LITTLE HARD ON HER SAID MERCIFUL MISSUS ROMSEY
AND HOW OFTEN YOU KISS ME WHAT IS IT YOU HAVE COME TO SAY TO ME GOOD NIGHT OR GOOD BY SYDNEY LAID HER DOWN AGAIN ON THE PILLOW GAVE HER A LAST KISS AND RAN OUT OF THE ROOM
AND THE BITTER SIGH BROKE FROM HER AND MINGLED ITS LITTLE UNHEARD MISERY WITH THE GRAND RISE AND FALL OF THE TUMULT OF LONDON LIFE WHILE HE WAS STILL AT THE WINDOW
IN HONOR OF AN INTERESTING DOMESTIC EVENT HER HUSBAND ABSENT ON THE CONTINENT FOR SOME TIME PAST ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH HIS FIRM HAD RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND HAD THAT EVENING
AS THE GIRL MOVED AWAY SYDNEY SPOKE TO HER I HOPE LITTLE KITTY IS WELL AND HAPPY THE MOTHER DOES NOT LIVE WHO COULD HAVE RESISTED THE TONE IN WHICH THAT QUESTION WAS PUT THE BROKEN HEART THE LOVE FOR THE CHILD
HERBERT'S INSANE JEALOUSY OF THE MAN WHO WAS ABOUT TO BECOME CATHERINE'S HUSBAND HAD LED HIM INTO A SERIOUS ERROR HE HAD DRIVEN CATHERINE'S MOTHER TO DESPERATION IN THAT STATE OF MIND
AND THOUGHT OVER WHAT HE HAD READ IF HE HAD DONE NOTHING ELSE HE HAD DRAINED THE BITTER CUP
SITUATED AT THE INNERMOST END OF A DULL LITTLE BAY SANDYSEAL SO FAR AS ANY VIEW OF THE SHIPPING IN THE CHANNEL WAS CONCERNED MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUILT ON A REMOTE ISLAND IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN
THE DRESS OF THIS WONDERFUL CREATURE EXHIBITED THE LATEST AUDACITIES OF FRENCH FASHION HER HEAD MADE A BOW HER EYES WENT TO SLEEP AND WOKE AGAIN
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY CATHERINE WHICH I'M AFRAID WILL DISTRESS YOU HIS VOICE FALTERED HIS EYES RESTED ON HER
HOWEVER INSOLENTLY YOU MAY BEHAVE CATHERINE YOU WILL NOT SUCCEED IN PROVOKING ME YOUR MOTHER IS BOUND TO OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE TRUTH YOU HAVE A RIVAL IN YOUR HUSBAND'S AFFECTIONS
EVERYTHING THAT COULD DISTRESS ME SHE WAS READY TO MENTION SHE TOLD ME OF YOUR MOTHER'S SECOND MARRIAGE OF HER MISERABLE DEATH OF THE POOR BOY YOUR BROTHER MISSING AND NEVER HEARD OF SINCE
HOW YOU MET WITH HIM THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL ROMANTIC IN MY FIRST DISCOVERY OF HIM I WAS READING THE POLICE REPORTS IN A NEWSPAPER THE POOR WRETCH WAS BROUGHT BEFORE A MAGISTRATE CHARGED WITH BREAKING A WINDOW
I HAVE SEEN MY FRIEND SARRAZIN RANDAL BEGAN AND I HAVE PERSUADED HIM TO TRUST ME WITH CATHERINE'S PRESENT ADDRESS I CAN SEND HERBERT THERE IMMEDIATELY IF YOU WILL ONLY HELP ME
IN SILENCE MISSUS LINLEY RAISED HER TOOK THE WRITING WHICH TESTIFIED TO HER CHARACTER FROM THE TABLE AND PRESENTED IT LINLEY LOOKED AT HIS WIFE LOOKED AT THE GOVERNESS HE WAITED
THERE WAS A CHANGE IN HIS TONE AS HE PUT THAT QUESTION WHICH WARNED BENNYDECK TO BE ON HIS GUARD I HAVE NOT YET CONSULTED MY FRIEND'S OPINION HE ANSWERED SHORTLY
AT THE BACK OF THE HOTEL TWO SLOVENLY ROWS OF COTTAGES TOOK THEIR CROOKED COURSE INLAND SAILING MASTERS OF YACHTS OFF DUTY SAT AND YAWNED AT THE WINDOWS LAZY FISHERMEN
MISSUS PRESTY LAID THE CARD DOWN AGAIN AND OWNED THAT SHE WISHED RANDAL HAD BEEN A LITTLE MORE EXPLICIT WHO CAN IT BE SHE WONDERED
KITTY WHISPERED AGAIN I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING
YOU WILL STAY AND HAVE DINNER TOO WON'T YOU RANDAL PROMISED TO DINE WITH KITTY WHEN THEY MET IN LONDON BEFORE HE LEFT THE ROOM HE POINTED TO HIS CARD ON THE TABLE LET MY FRIEND SEE THAT MESSAGE HE SAID AS HE WENT OUT
YOU SHALL DECIDE THIS TIME SHE SUBMITTED AND PROMISED TO THINK OF IT LEAVING HIM WITH THE FIRST EXPRESSION OF TROUBLE THAT HAD SHOWN ITSELF IN HER FACE
WAS THE INSTANT REPLY WHEN TO NIGHT CATHERINE
THE POOR DESERTED CREATURE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED SHE COULD NEVER FORGET THAT SHE HAD DISGRACED THEM THE GOOD SISTER OF CHARITY WON HER CONFIDENCE A RETREAT WHICH WOULD HIDE HER FROM THE WORLD AND DEVOTE HER TO RELIGION FOR THE REST OF HER DAYS
MISSUS PRESTY ASSUMED THE DISGUISE OF PATIENT SUBMISSION AND USED THE IRRESISTIBLE INFLUENCE OF GOOD HUMOR AND GOOD SENSE I DON'T COMPLAIN DEAR RANDAL OF WHAT YOU HAVE SAID TO ME SHE REPLIED
THAN HERSELF AND HER FUTURE LOOKING ABSENTLY ROUND THE ROOM SHE NOTICED THE PACKET OF HER FATHER'S LETTERS PLACED ON THE TABLE BY HER BEDSIDE THE FIRST THREE LETTERS THAT SHE EXAMINED
CONGRATULATE ME ON HAVING DISCOVERED RODERICK WESTERFIELD'S DAUGHTER THAT REPLY AND THE TONE IN WHICH IT WAS GIVEN LED RANDAL TO ASK IF THE ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN PREMATURELY ANNOUNCED
THE PRESBYTERY HAS LOST NOTHING OF ITS CHARM NOR THE GARDEN ITS BRIGHTNESS CERTAINLY MY FRIEND KNEW HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HIM BY THE USE OF WHOLLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE PHRASES I OBSERVED AS MUCH TO HIM
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE MURDER OF THE MURDER OF POOR MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON A GOOD GIRL MUCH LOVED EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF IT AND MANY THINGS BESIDES BUT THAT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS NOT EVEN MINE
IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE MURDERER WAS WORKING FOR THE OTHER NO NO REPLIED ROULETABILLE WITH A STRANGE SMILE I HAVE EXPECTED TO FIND THESE FOOTMARKS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THESE ARE NOT THE FOOTMARKS OF THE MURDERER THEN THERE WERE TWO
WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED THAT MORNING WITH THE SKILL OF AN ACROBAT HE GOT INTO THE LODGE BY AN UPPER WINDOW WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN AND RETURNED TEN MINUTES LATER HE SAID ONLY AH A WORD WHICH IN HIS MOUTH
WE SHALL SEE THAT LATER HE REPLIED FOR THE PRESENT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT THE LANDLORD SAID ABOUT THE MAN THE LANDLORD HATES HIM I DIDN'T TAKE YOU TO BREAKFAST AT THE DONJON INN FOR THE SAKE OF THE GREEN MAN
THEN THEY ARE THE MURDERERS FREDERIC LARSAN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WHEN YOU CAN'T
THE SOBS HAD CEASED IF WE CAN'T HEAR WE MAY AT LEAST TRY TO SEE SAID ROULETABILLE AND MAKING A SIGN TO ME TO DEADEN THE SOUND OF MY STEPS
AND THAT ALL THE LAND AND WOODS BELONG TO HIM HE'LL NOT LET A POOR CREATURE EAT A MORSEL OF BREAD ON THE GRASS HIS GRASS DOES HE OFTEN COME HERE TOO OFTEN BUT I'VE MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT HIS FACE DOESN'T PLEASE ME
HAS HE RETURNED THEN YES DURING THAT FAMOUS NIGHT WHEN THE STRANGE PHENOMENON OCCURRED
LARSAN TURNED HIS HEAD AT THE SOUND OF A VEHICLE WHICH HAD COME FROM THE CHATEAU AND REACHED THE GATE BEHIND HIM
AND YET SHE KEEPS THE SECRET WHEN I KNOW WHO I WILL SPEAK TO HIM TO HIM SHE LOOKED AT US NOW WITH A FAR AWAY LOOK IN HER EYES AS IF WE WERE NOT IN THE CHAMBER MONSIEUR STANGERSON BROKE THE SILENCE
IF I COULD BUT MAKE THIS WOMAN WHO DOES NOT EVEN LOOK AT US UNDERSTAND SHE IS ABSORBED BY HER FEARS AND BY HER FATHER'S DISTRESS OF MIND AND I CAN DO NOTHING TO SAVE HER YES
FROM THE QUESTIONS PUT BY HIM FROM THE EXPLANATION WHICH HE GIVES ME IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT IN SPITE OF ALL OUR SENSES
THEN HE SUDDENLY BEGAN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE WERE A LITTLE CHILD HE SMILED AT HER AND SEEMED NOT TO KNOW EITHER WHAT HE SAID OR WHAT HE DID THE ILLUSTRIOUS PROFESSOR HAD LOST HIS HEAD
CAN YOU DENY THAT THEY BELONG TO ROBERT DARZAC OF COURSE ONE MAY BE MISTAKEN HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT THOSE FOOTPRINTS ONLY GO IN ONE DIRECTION THAT THERE ARE NO RETURN MARKS WHEN THE MAN CAME FROM THE CHAMBER PURSUED BY ALL OF US
INDEED THE RESULTS OF THAT STILL UNKNOWN SCIENCE KNOWN AS HYPNOTISM FOR EXAMPLE WERE NOT MORE INEXPLICABLE THAN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MATTER OF THE MURDERER AT THE MOMENT WHEN FOUR PERSONS WERE WITHIN TOUCH OF HIM I SPEAK OF HYPNOTISM AS I WOULD OF ELECTRICITY
KNOWN TO HIM ALONE HE KNOWS THE CHATEAU HE SAID TO ME HE KNOWS IT WELL
BUT HE LACKS REASONING POWER THE MATHEMATICS OF HIS IDEAS ARE VERY POOR I LOOKED CLOSELY AT ROULETABILLE AND COULD NOT HELP SMILING ON HEARING THIS BOY OF EIGHTEEN TALKING OF A MAN WHO HAD PROVED TO THE WORLD THAT HE WAS THE FINEST POLICE SLEUTH IN EUROPE YOU SMILE
WE APPROACHED UNTIL WE HAD REACHED THE SIDE OF A DOOR THAT WAS SITUATED JUST UNDER THE WINDOW ROULETABILLE IN A LOW TONE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS THE WINDOW OF MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S CHAMBER
BUT HE MERELY SMILED I SHOULD HAVE PROPOSED THAT HE GIVE ME SOME EXPLANATION BUT HE PUT A FINGER TO HIS LIPS WHICH EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED THAT HE HAD NOT ONLY DETERMINED NOT TO SPEAK BUT ALSO ENJOINED SILENCE ON MY PART
HIS FACE HAD CHANGED EXPRESSING FIERCE HATRED HE WENT AND GLUED HIMSELF TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS WATCHING THE ROAD
I WILL GO TO WORK ONCE MORE AND ACCOMPLISH WONDERS I MOVE TOWARDS HER
AND PICKED UP HIS CANE FROM THE GROUND A PROCEEDING TO WHICH I WAS PERHAPS WRONG NOT TO ATTACH SOME IMPORTANCE WE WERE NOW OUT OF THE PARK ROULETABILLE HAD DROPPED INTO SILENCE
PERMITS US TO AFFIRM THAT AT HALF PAST ONE THE MURDERER WAS NOT IN THE CHAMBER UNDER THE BED UNLESS HE WAS IN COLLUSION WITH THE CHAMBERMAID WHAT DO YOU SAY MONSIEUR DARZAC MONSIEUR DARZAC SHOOK HIS HEAD
WHEN ROULETABILLE HAD SEEN ME INTO THE TRAIN HE SAID YOU'LL REMEMBER THE ADDRESS YES CASSETTE SIX A OPERA RELY ON ME YOU SHALL HAVE WORD TOMORROW MORNING
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT I ASKED SINCE THESE FOOTMARKS ARE NOT CONTINUED ON THE PATH WHAT MAKES ME THINK THAT WHY THESE FOOTPRINTS WHICH I EXPECTED TO FIND HE CRIED POINTING TO THE SHARPLY OUTLINED IMPRINT OF A NEAT BOOT SEE
IS FREDERIC LARSAN IN HIS ROOM I ASKED POINTING TO THE PARTITION NO MY FRIEND ANSWERED HE WENT TO PARIS THIS MORNING STILL ON THE SCENT OF DARZAC WHO ALSO LEFT FOR PARIS THAT MATTER WILL TURN OUT BADLY
IF YOU USE IT INDISCRIMINATELY YOU ARE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY THAT MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON FIRED HER REVOLVER BUT YOU ARE WRONG WHEN YOU SAY THAT SHE WOUNDED THE MURDERER IN THE HAND I AM SURE OF IT
AND NOW DESPAIRING FACE AT LENGTH REGAINING HIS SELF POSSESSION HE BOWED TO US AND REMARKING IN A CHANGED VOICE THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN TO THE CHATEAU
WHEN WE WERE OUTSIDE I LOOKED AT LARSAN HIS FACE WAS IMPENETRABLE WELL I SAID WELL HE REPEATED
BY SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE MEANS HAD BEEN ABLE TO ELUDE US THEN FOLLOWS A SILENCE WHAT A SILENCE WE ARE ALL THERE LOOKING AT HER HER FATHER LARSAN DADDY JACQUES AND I
LIKE YOU I THINK THAT HE FOUND IT SOMEWHERE NEAR MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC BUT IF AS YOU SUPPOSE THE MURDERER WAS IN THE YELLOW ROOM FOR FIVE OR EVEN SIX HOURS AND THE CRIME WAS NOT COMMITTED UNTIL TOWARDS MIDNIGHT
IT WAS A MORNING IN WHICH THE APPROACH OF WINTER WAS UNMISTAKABLE THE ROOM WAS A TOLERABLY LARGE ONE FURNISHED WITH TWO HEAVY TABLES SOME STOOLS A COUNTER DECORATED WITH ROWS OF BOTTLES OF SYRUP AND ALCOHOL
I HAD NEVER HEARD SO LUGUBRIOUS A CRY AS IF DRAWN BY THE CAT'S CRY A MAN FOLLOWED THE OLD WOMAN IN IT WAS THE GREEN MAN HE SALUTED BY RAISING HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND SEATED HIMSELF AT A TABLE NEAR TO OURS
IF I DID NOT REASON AS I DO IN REGARD TO THIS GRAVEL HE WENT ON I SHOULD HAVE TO ASSUME A BALLOON MY DEAR FELLOW THE SCIENCE OF THE AEROSTATION OF DIRIGIBLE BALLOONS IS NOT YET DEVELOPED ENOUGH FOR ME TO CONSIDER IT
BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO SAY ON THIS AFFAIR IF MY HYPOTHESIS IS JUSTIFIED AND WHAT IS YOUR HYPOTHESIS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW IF IT DOES NOT TURN OUT TO BE THE TRUTH
ROBERT DARZAC WITH KNIT BROW WAS BEGINNING TO SHOW IMPATIENCE I PRESENTED ROULETABILLE AS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE BUT AS SOON AS HE LEARNT THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS A JOURNALIST HE LOOKED AT ME VERY REPROACHFULLY
I HAVE ALWAYS SEEN YOU WALKING WITH YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS IT IS A PRESENT REPLIED THE DETECTIVE RECENT INSISTED ROULETABILLE NO IT WAS GIVEN TO ME IN LONDON
AFTER PASSING THE DONJON WHICH IS SITUATED AT THE EXTREME END OF THE LEFT WING WE WENT TO THE BACK OF THE CHATEAU ROULETABILLE POINTING TO A WINDOW WHICH I RECOGNISED AS THE ONLY ONE BELONGING TO MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S APARTMENT SAID TO ME
ROULETABILLE OPENED IT A FIGURE ENTERED
WHICH TOUCHES ON THE ROAD FROM EPINAY TO CORBEIL TO TELL ME THAT THE MURDERER HAD CERTAINLY PASSED THAT WAY BEFORE ENTERING THE GROUNDS AND CONCEALING HIMSELF IN THE LITTLE CLUMP OF TREES YOU DON'T THINK THEN THAT THE KEEPER KNOWS ANYTHING OF IT I ASKED
SAID ROULETABILLE RAISING HIS HAT AND SHOWING THE PROFOUND RESPECT BASED ON ADMIRATION WHICH THE YOUNG REPORTER FELT FOR THE CELEBRATED DETECTIVE CAN YOU TELL ME WHETHER MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC IS AT THE CHATEAU AT THIS MOMENT HERE IS ONE OF HIS FRIENDS OF THE PARIS BAR
A GLASS OF CIDER DADDY MATHIEU HE SAID AS THE GREEN MAN ENTERED DADDY MATHIEU HAD STARTED VIOLENTLY BUT VISIBLY MASTERING HIMSELF HE SAID I'VE NO MORE CIDER I SERVED THE LAST BOTTLES TO THESE GENTLEMEN
WHICH HE AT ONCE STIFLED AND PLACED HIMSELF AT OUR ORDERS AS OBEDIENTLY AS MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC HAD DONE
EVERY TIME THE MURDERER COMES TO THE CHATEAU MONSIEUR DARZAC BY A STRANGE FATALITY ABSENTS HIMSELF AND REFUSES TO GIVE ANY ACCOUNT OF HOW HE EMPLOYS HIS TIME EVERY TIME THE ASSASSIN COMES TO THE CHATEAU I CRIED
SAID ROULETABILLE POINTING TO THE LODGE THE DOOR AND WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE CLOSE SHUT
MAY I LOOK AT IT OH
SO THE YOUNG WOMAN WITH THE LARGE TENDER EYES WHOM WE HAD JUST SEEN WAS THE WIFE OF THIS REPUGNANT AND BRUTAL RUSTIC WHOSE JEALOUSY SEEMED TO EMPHASISE HIS PHYSICAL UGLINESS SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM THE INNKEEPER LEFT THE ROOM
IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE METHOD IF YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS AND THAT BUMP ON YOUR FOREHEAD
THREE WINDOWS LOOKED OUT ON TO THE ROAD A COLOURED ADVERTISEMENT LAUDED THE MANY MERITS OF A NEW VERMOUTH ON THE MANTELPIECE WAS ARRAYED THE INNKEEPER'S COLLECTION OF FIGURED EARTHENWARE POTS AND STONE JUGS
HE WAS REMARKABLY HANDSOME AS HE PASSED NEAR THE INN HE HESITATED AS IF ASKING HIMSELF WHETHER OR NO HE SHOULD ENTER IT GAVE A GLANCE TOWARDS US TOOK A FEW WHIFFS AT HIS PIPE AND THEN RESUMED HIS WALK AT THE SAME NONCHALANT PACE
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TO HAVE LEFT FRANCE THE DAY AFTER THE RECEPTION AT THE ELYSEE ROULETABILLE AND I OUTWARDLY INDIFFERENT LISTENED MOST INTENTLY
WHILE TO LARSAN IT SHOWED NOTHING BUT CONSUMMATE HYPOCRISY ACTED WITH FINISHED ART BY MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S FIANCE AS WE REACHED THE PARK GATE LARSAN STOPPED US
ASKED ROULETABILLE PERFECTLY REPLIED ARTHUR RANCE I RECOGNISE YOU AS THE LAD AT THE BAR THE FACE OF ROULETABILLE CRIMSONED AT BEING CALLED A LAD I WANT TO SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU
AND WE WERE ONCE MORE IN HIS ROOM HE REPLIED
THE INNKEEPER LOOKED AT HIM SIDEWAYS AND SAID GRUFFLY NOT EVEN YOURS THE OMELETTE READY WE SAT DOWN AT TABLE AND WERE SILENTLY EATING WHEN THE DOOR WAS PUSHED OPEN AND AN OLD WOMAN DRESSED IN RAGS LEANING ON A STICK
THE BICYCLE EXPLAINS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MURDERER'S BIG FOOT PRINTS I SAID THE MURDERER WITH HIS ROUGH BOOTS MOUNTED A BICYCLE HIS ACCOMPLICE THE WEARER OF THE NEAT BOOTS HAD COME TO WAIT FOR HIM ON THE EDGE OF THE LAKE WITH THE BICYCLE
MY POOR ROBERT ROULETABILLE WHISPERED IN MY EAR
WITH WHICH TO SINK THE BOOTS IN THE LAKE
IF WE HAD A BICYCLE HERE WE MIGHT DEMONSTRATE THE CORRECTNESS OF THE YOUNG MAN'S REASONING MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC
HIS FOREHEAD WAS PROMINENT HIS CHIN AND CHEEKS CLEAN SHAVEN HIS UPPER LIP WITHOUT MOUSTACHE WAS FINELY CHISELLED HIS EYES WERE RATHER SMALL AND ROUND WITH A LOOK IN THEM THAT WAS AT ONCE SEARCHING AND DISQUIETING
WE ARE NOT POLICEMEN I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE POLICE I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYONE REPLIED THE MAN I HAD MADE MY FRIEND UNDERSTAND BY A SIGN THAT WE SHOULD DO BETTER NOT TO INSIST BUT BEING DETERMINED TO ENTER THE INN
WHO WAS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED PHRENOLOGISTS OF THE NEW WORLD OWING TO NEW EXPERIMENTS HE HAD MADE ENORMOUS STRIDES BEYOND THE SCIENCE OF GALL AND LAVATER
THAT ESCAPED ME BUT MY MIND WAS TURNED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF FALSE INDICATIONS OF HIS TRACK WHICH THE MURDERER LEFT AND BY THE MEASURE OF THE BLACK FOOT MARKS CORRESPONDING WITH THAT OF DADDY JACQUES'S BOOTS
HAD MADE ALL SPEED DOUBTLESS KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE THAT IF HE WAS INTERRUPTED IN WHAT HE WAS DOING IT WAS BECAUSE HIS SERVICES WERE URGENTLY NEEDED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION SO AS ROULETABILLE SAID HE WAS THAT MORNING ALREADY AT WORK
IT IS OF MUCH TOO GRAVE A NATURE TO SPEAK OF IT SO LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO BE ONLY A HYPOTHESIS HAVE YOU AT LEAST SOME IDEA AS TO WHO THE MURDERER IS NO MONSIEUR I DON'T KNOW WHO THE MURDERER IS
NO REPLIED MONSIEUR DARZAC THERE IS NOT I TOOK MINE FOUR DAYS AGO TO PARIS THE LAST TIME I CAME TO THE CHATEAU BEFORE THE CRIME THAT'S A PITY REPLIED FRED VERY COLDLY
TO RETURN WITH ALL HASTE
FOLLOWED BY ME TOWARDS THE LITTLE BUILDING WHICH STANDING NEAR THE PARK GATE
BUT BY HER GESTURES SHE BEGGED US TO LEAVE HER ALONE EXPRESSING WEARINESS AND THE NEED FOR IMMEDIATE REST MONSIEUR STANGERSON ASKED US TO GO BACK TO OUR ROOMS AND THANKED US FREDERIC LARSAN AND I BOWED TO HIM AND FOLLOWED BY DADDY JACQUES WE REGAINED THE GALLERY
WITH RAPID STRIDES FINALLY HE SET OFF RUNNING STILL LOOKING INTO THE PALM OF HIS HAND ROULETABILLE HAD BROUGHT ME TO A STANDSTILL BY A GESTURE HUSH FREDERIC LARSAN IS AT WORK
I STILL CATCH MYSELF REPEATING FROM THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART SAVE HER SAVE HER WITHOUT HIS SPEAKING
PALE AS HE WAS HE BECAME PALER HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE YOUNG MAN IN TERROR AND HE IMMEDIATELY DESCENDED FROM THE VEHICLE IN AN INEXPRESSIBLE STATE OF AGITATION COME
AND HE CALLED TO FREDERIC LARSAN MONSIEUR FRED THESE NEAT FOOTPRINTS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF THE CRIME YES YOUNG MAN YES THEY HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY MADE REPLIED FRED WITHOUT RAISING HIS HEAD
AND I SAW NO SHADOW MOVE ACROSS IT I LISTENED AND PRESENTLY FROM ABOVE ME THESE WORDS REACHED MY EARS
HE HELD OUT A PACKET TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO TOOK IT EAGERLY AND WENT OUT BY THE DOOR CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY HER CAT THEN YOU WON'T SERVE ME ASKED THE GREEN MAN DADDY MATHIEU'S FACE WAS PLACID AND NO LONGER RETAINED ITS EXPRESSION OF HATRED
I GO TO THE DOOR AND RAP SMARTLY ON IT
LIKE ME HE HAD INSISTED ON BEING ALLOWED TO QUESTION THE UNHAPPY LADY
AND THE POLICE OF LONDON AND EVEN OF AMERICA OFTEN CALLED HIM IN TO THEIR AID WHEN THEIR OWN NATIONAL INSPECTORS AND DETECTIVES FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE END OF THEIR WITS AND RESOURCES
HOLDING HIS BICYCLE IN HIS HAND FOR HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO RIDE IT ON THIS ROUGH PATH THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE LIGHTNESS OF THE IMPRESSION MADE BY THE WHEELS ALONG IT IN SPITE OF THE SOFTNESS OF THE GROUND IF THERE HAD BEEN A MAN ON THE BICYCLE
SIGNIFIED MANY THINGS WE WERE ABOUT TO TAKE THE ROAD LEADING TO THE CHATEAU WHEN A CONSIDERABLE STIR AT THE PARK GATE ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION
THEN GIVE ME A GLASS OF WHITE WINE SAID THE GREEN MAN WITHOUT SHOWING THE LEAST SURPRISE I'VE NO MORE WHITE WINE NO MORE ANYTHING SAID DADDY MATHIEU SURLILY HOW IS MADAME MATHIEU QUITE WELL THANK YOU
AND FREDERIC LARSAN HIMSELF IS OBLIGED TO TURN AWAY TO HIDE HIS EMOTION FOR MYSELF I AM ABLE NEITHER TO THINK OR FEEL I FELT AN INFINITE CONTEMPT FOR MYSELF
WE COULD ONLY HAVE ANSWERED THAT THE ASSASSIN HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE GALLERY IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE THOUGHT HE WAS NO LONGER ANYWHERE HE HAD ELUDED US WHEN WE ALL HAD OUR HANDS STRETCHED OUT READY TO SEIZE HIM WHEN WE WERE ALMOST TOUCHING HIM
FRED IMPERTURBABLE INTERRUPTED HIM DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION DEFECTIVE OBSERVATION THE EXAMINATION OF THE HANDKERCHIEF THE NUMBERLESS LITTLE ROUND SCARLET STAINS THE IMPRESSION OF DROPS WHICH I FOUND IN THE TRACKS OF THE FOOTPRINTS AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE MADE ON THE FLOOR
THE MAN ALLOWED THE BLOOD TO FLOW INTO HIS HAND AND HANDKERCHIEF AND DRIED HIS HAND ON THE WALL THE FACT IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT HE ADDED BECAUSE THERE IS NO NEED OF HIS BEING WOUNDED IN THE HAND FOR HIM TO BE THE MURDERER
YOU HAVE AN IDEA THEN ABOUT THIS MATTER SAID LARSAN LOOKING AT ROULETABILLE INTENTLY YET
NEVERTHELESS HE INSISTED ON ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE STATION AT EPINAY IN CROSSING THE PARK HE SAID TO ME FREDERIC IS REALLY VERY CLEVER AND HAS NOT BELIED HIS REPUTATION
A SIMPLY INSTINCTIVE OBSERVATION TAKE CARE
THE MURDERER WOULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM I EXPRESSED SOME DOUBT ON THIS REMINDING HIM OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE IN THE GALLERY AND SUGGESTED THAT THE SAME PHENOMENON MIGHT OCCUR AGAIN
HE WAS OF MIDDLE HEIGHT AND WELL BUILT WITH A GENERAL BEARING ELEGANT AND GENTLEMANLY THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT HIM OF THE VULGAR POLICEMAN IN HIS WAY HE WAS AN ARTIST AND ONE FELT THAT HE HAD A HIGH OPINION OF HIMSELF
WHAT MEN CALL DREAMERS AND BIGOTS AND FANATICS CAUSING MISERY TO THEMSELVES AND TO ALL WHO DEAL WITH THEM SO I SAY AGAIN THINK WELL
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AND THINK I WANT EVERY ONE TO LOOK AND THINK HALF THE MISERY IN THE WORLD COMES FIRST FROM NOT LOOKING AND THEN FROM NOT THINKING AND I DO NOT WANT YOU TO BE MISERABLE
WHICH HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE LAST TWO DAYS FOR THE CATTLE WHEN THEY ARE TURNED IN NEXT WEEK BUT IF THE MACHINE CUTS ALL THE GRASS THE POOR MOWERS WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO NOT SO
BOUNDLESS WEALTH IN ONE WORD WAITING FOR THEM TO SEND IT ALL DOWN THE WATERS OF THE MIGHTY RIVER AMAZON ENRICHING US HERE IN THE OLD WORLD AND ENRICHING THEMSELVES THERE IN THE NEW IF THEY WOULD ONLY GO AND USE THESE GIFTS OF GOD
AND THEREFORE IT IS A FLESH AND MILK MANUFACTORY WE MUST PUT INTO IT EVERY YEAR YARD STUFF TANK STUFF GUANO BONES AND ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING OF THAT KIN
IT DROPS ITS VENOM INTO THE TENDEREST HEARTS ALAS AND MAKES THEM CALL WRONG RIGHT AND RIGHT WRONG LOVE CRUELTY AND CRUELTY LOVE
FOR THEY LEARN MEAN SLY SLAVISH WAYS WHICH GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD EVER LEARN WELL SAID THE WISE MAN THE HUMAN PLANT LIKE THE VEGETABLES CAN ONLY FLOWER IN SUNSHINE SO DO YOU GO AND ENJOY YOURSELF IN THE SUNSHINE
THEY ARE ALL BUSY ENOUGH ELSEWHERE THERE IS PLENTY OF OTHER WORK TO BE DONE THANK GOD AND WHOLESOMER AND EASIER WORK THAN MOWING WITH A BURNING SUN ON THEIR BACKS DRINKING GALLONS OF BEER AND GETTING FIRST HOT AND THEN COLD ACROSS THE LOINS
COME UP AND LOOK AT IT AND SEE HOW SWIFT AND SMOOTH IT SHEARS THE LONG GRASS DOWN SO THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SWATHE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MERELY FALLEN FLAT AND YOU MUST MOVE IT BEFORE YOU FIND THAT IT HAS BEEN CUT OFF AH
YOU WILL LEARN SOMETHING OF THE REASON OF THINGS FOR THAT THIRST TO KNOW WHY WAS PUT INTO THE HEARTS OF LITTLE CHILDREN BY GOD HIMSELF AND I BELIEVE THAT GOD WOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN THEM THAT THIRST IF HE HAD NOT MEANT TO SATISFY IT
THAT SORT OF STUPID CUNNING INTO HIS LITTLE BRAIN AND YET GET NO MORE
KINDS OF THINGS YOU MUST SEE WHICH ARE LIKE AND WHICH UNLIKE WHAT THEY ARE LIKE IN AND WHAT THEY ARE UNLIKE IN YOU ARE BEGINNING TO DO THAT WITH YOUR COLLECTION OF BUTTERFLIES YOU LIKE TO ARRANGE THEM
IT IS BY WATCHING THE COMMON NATURAL THINGS AROUND YOU AND CONSIDERING THE LILIES OF THE FIELD HOW THEY GROW THAT YOU WILL BEGIN AT LEAST TO LEARN THAT FAR DIVINER MYSTERY THAT YOU HAVE A FATHER IN HEAVEN AND SO YOU WILL BE DELIVERED
THEREFORE IT IS THAT YOU CANNOT BE CONTENT AND OUGHT NOT TO BE CONTENT WITH ASKING HOW THINGS HAPPEN BUT MUST GO ON TO ASK WHY YOU CANNOT BE CONTENT WITH KNOWING THE CAUSES OF THINGS
MADAM HOW AND LADY WHY OR FIRST LESSONS IN EARTH LORE FOR CHILDREN
SO USE YOUR EYES AND YOUR INTELLECT YOUR SENSES AND YOUR BRAINS AND LEARN WHAT GOD IS TRYING TO TEACH YOU CONTINUALLY BY THEM I DO NOT MEAN THAT YOU MUST STOP THERE AND LEARN NOTHING MORE ANYTHING BUT THAT
DO YOU NOT THINK WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT HE MEANT EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER SPOKE A WORD HE WOULD BE VERY WRONG IN BEHAVING SO OF COURSE
AND LOW SHOES WHICH ALWAYS CAME OFF IN STICKY GROUND AND TERRIBLY DIRTY AND WET HE IS BUT HE NEVER HE SAYS HAD SUCH A PLEASANT WALK IN HIS LIFE AND HE HAS BROUGHT HOME HIS HANDKERCHIEF
UNLESS WE BE WATCHFUL INTO YOUR HEARTS AND MINE AND ITS NAME IS THE TREE OF UNREASON WHOSE ROOTS ARE CONCEIT AND IGNORANCE AND ITS JUICES FOLLY AND DEATH
FOR IN THAT EASTERN PART OF THEIR OWN LAND GOD'S GIFTS ARE WAITING FOR THEM IN A PARADISE SUCH AS I CAN NEITHER DESCRIBE NOR YOU CONCEIVE PRECIOUS WOODS FRUITS DRUGS AND WHAT NOT
SAVE A TORRENT ROARING BETWEEN WALLS OF POLISHED ROCK HIGH ABOVE THE TORRENT THE ROAD WAS CUT OUT AMONG THE CLIFFS AND ABOVE THE ROAD ROSE MORE CLIFFS WITH GREAT BLACK CAVERN MOUTHS HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE OUR HEADS
AH THAT IS A LONG STORY AND ONE THAT SHOWS OUR FOREFATHERS THOUGH THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT RAILROADS OR ELECTRICITY WERE NOT SUCH SIMPLETONS AS SOME FOLKS THINK
TO MY SON GRENVILLE ARTHUR AND TO HIS SCHOOL FELLOWS AT WINTON HOUSE THIS LITTLE BOOK IS DEDICATED PREFACE MY DEAR BOYS WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE
TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE MUST TALK A LITTLE ABOUT EARTHQUAKES AND WHAT MAKES THEM AND IN ORDER TO FIND OUT THAT LET US TRY THE VERY SIMPLEST CAUSE OF WHICH WE CAN THINK
USE SO SAID MISTER ANDREWS AND SO I SAY DEAR BOYS
SOMETHING VERY LIKE WHAT THE BIBLE CALLS TEMPTING GOD STAKING THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR LIVES UPON THE CHANCES OF NO EARTHQUAKES COMING WHILE THEY OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT AN EARTHQUAKE MIGHT COME ANY DAY THEY HAVE FULFILLED
AS YOU WOULD FIND IF YOU TRIED TO SEE WHAT MAKES THAT MIDSUMMER HUM OF WHICH THE HAYMAKERS ARE SO FOND BECAUSE IT PROMISES FAIR WEATHER WHY IT IS ONLY THE GNATS AND FLIES ONLY THE GNATS AND FLIES
JUST AS THE BUTTER GROWS IN THE CHURN SO YOU MUST PUT FRESH GRASS STUFF CONTINUALLY INTO THE SOIL AS YOU PUT FRESH CREAM INTO THE CHURN YOU HAVE HEARD THE FARM MEN SAY THAT CROP HAS TAKEN A GOOD DEAL OUT OF THE LAND
GOD HAS GIVEN YOU EYES IT IS YOUR DUTY TO GOD TO USE THEM IF YOUR PARENTS TRIED TO TEACH YOU YOUR LESSONS IN THE MOST AGREEABLE WAY BY BEAUTIFUL PICTURE BOOKS WOULD IT NOT BE UNGRACIOUS UNGRATEFUL AND ALTOGETHER NAUGHTY AND WRONG
IT IS GOOD FOR LITTLE FOLK THAT BIG FOLK SHOULD NOW AND THEN TALK OVER THEIR HEADS AS THE SAYING IS AND MAKE THEM FEEL HOW IGNORANT THEY ARE AND HOW MANY SOLEMN AND EARNEST QUESTIONS THERE ARE IN THE WORLD ON WHICH THEY MUST MAKE UP THEIR MINDS SOME DAY THOUGH NOT YET
THE OBSERVING EYE AND INQUIRING MIND FIND MATTER OF IMPROVEMENT AND DELIGHT IN EVERY RAMBLE YOU THEN WILLIAM CONTINUE TO USE YOUR EYES AND YOU ROBERT
AND MANY OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AND THEN THEY SAVED THE SEEDS OF THOSE FATTENING WILD GRASSES AND SOWED THEM IN FRESH SPOTS OFTEN THEY MADE MISTAKES THEY WERE CARELESS AND GOT WEEDS AMONG THE SEED
THRUSHES AND BLACKBIRDS AND SPARROWS AND CHAFFINCHES AND GREENFINCHES AND BULLFINCHES AND TOMTITS AND THERE ARE FOUR KINDS OF TOMTITS ROUND HERE REMEMBER BUT WE MAY GO ON WITH SUCH TALK FOR EVER
I WISH I KNEW HOW FAR THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE HAPPY FOR HAPPY THEY MUST BE WHETHER THEY KNOW IT OR NOT I WISH I KNEW HOW THEY LIVE AT ALL I WISH I EVEN KNEW HOW MANY SORTS THERE ARE HUMMING ROUND US AT THIS MOMENT HOW MANY KINDS
THAT WE MAY GUESS AT SOMETHING LIKE A GOOD REASON FOR THE TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKES IN SOUTH AMERICA I DO NOT WISH TO BE HARD UPON POOR PEOPLE IN GREAT AFFLICTION BUT I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PAST
AND IF YOU KNEW ALL THE NATURAL SCIENCE THAT EVER WAS OR EVER WILL BE KNOWN TO MEN THAT WOULD NOT SATISFY YOU FOR IT WOULD ONLY TELL YOU THE CAUSES OF THINGS WHILE YOUR SOULS WANT TO KNOW THE REASONS OF THINGS BESIDES
AND WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF FLAME AND WHAT IS THAT MY DEAR CHILD IF THE LANDLORD OF OUR HOUSE WAS IN THE HABIT OF PULLING THE ROOF DOWN UPON OUR HEADS AND PUTTING GUNPOWDER UNDER THE FOUNDATIONS TO BLOW US UP
UNHAPPINESS IF IT GOES ON TOO LONG WEARS THEM OUT BODY AND MIND AND THEY GROW ILL AND DIE OF BROKEN HEARTS AND BROKEN BRAINS MY CHILD AND SO AT LAST POOR SOULS FIND REST BENEATH THE CROSS
THE MORE PURE AIR WILL PASS INTO YOUR BLOOD AND MAKE IT RED AND HEALTHY AND THE MORE YOU ROMP AND PLAY UNLESS YOU OVERTIRE YOURSELF THE QUICKER WILL THAT BLOOD FLOW THROUGH ALL YOUR LIMBS TO MAKE BONE AND MUSCLE
THAT IS THE WISE AND SCIENTIFIC PLAN NOW WHATEVER MAKES THESE EARTHQUAKES MUST BE ENORMOUSLY STRONG THAT IS CERTAIN AND WHAT IS THE STRONGEST THING YOU KNOW OF IN THE WORLD THINK
THOUGH IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A GERANIUM LOOK RED NOT RED NO THE GERANIUM FLOWERS BY A LANTERN LOOK BLACK WHILE THE LEAVES LOOK GREEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME WE WILL TRY
IF I WANT MORE GRASS TO GROW I MUST PUT ON THE SOIL MORE OF WHAT GRASS IS MADE OF BUT THE BUTTER DON'T GROW AND THE GRASS DOES WHAT DOES THE GRASS GROW IN THE SOIL YES
HOWEVER THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH MADAM HOW SEEMS INCLINED TO ANSWER JUST NOW WHICH IS ALMOST AS DEEP AND MYSTERIOUS WHAT HOW ALL THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BECAME DIFFERENT OH
NOW DO YOU REMEMBER THAT RIDDLE WHICH I PUT TO YOU THE OTHER DAY WHAT HAD THE RATTLING OF THE LID OF THE KETTLE TO DO WITH HARTFORD BRIDGE FLAT BEING LIFTED OUT OF THE ANCIENT SEA THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE I BELIEVE
A WHOLE LONG DREAM TO ACCOUNT FOR IT AND YET THAT DREAM WHICH SEEMS TO YOU TO BE HOURS LONG HAS NOT TAKEN UP A SECOND OF TIME FOR THE VERY SAME NOISE WHICH BEGINS THE DREAM WAKES YOU AT THE END OF IT
HE FLOODS ALL THE SLOPES WITH YELLOW LIGHT MAKING THEM STAND OUT SHARP AGAINST THE BLACK SHADOWS OF THE WOOD WHILE WHERE THE GRASS IS STANDING STILL HE MAKES THE SHEETS OF SORREL FLOWER BLUSH ROSY RED
THAT IS BONE EARTH AND IN THEIR PLACES WILL COME OVER THE BANK THE OLD WEEDS AND GRASS OFF THE MOOR WHICH HAVE NOT ROOM TO GET IN NOW BECAUSE THE GROUND IS COVETED ALREADY THEY WANT NO AMMONIA NOR PHOSPHATES
BEFORE HE KNEW THE NAMES OF THE CARDS AND WHICH COUNTED HIGHEST AND TOOK THE OTHER OF COURSE HE WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH JUST AS FOOLISH ARE THOSE WHO MAKE UP THEORIES AS THEY CALL THEM ABOUT THIS WORLD AND HOW IT WAS MADE
BUT WHY DOES LADY WHY LIKE TO SEE US PLAY SHE LIKES TO SEE YOU HAPPY AS SHE LIKES TO SEE THE TREES AND BIRDS HAPPY FOR SHE KNOWS WELL THAT THERE IS NO FOOD NOR MEDICINE EITHER LIKE HAPPINESS
THAT HE DID NOT INTEND US TO LIVE IN HIS HOUSE ANY LONGER IF HE COULD HELP IT AND WAS GIVING US IN A VERY ROUGH FASHION NOTICE TO QUIT
AND CROSS THE ANDES INTO THE GREEN FORESTS OF THE EASTERN SIDE OF THEIR OWN LAND THEY MIGHT NOT ONLY LIVE FREE FROM EARTHQUAKES BUT IF THEY WOULD ONLY BE GOOD AND INDUSTRIOUS
DOES HE LABOUR ALL DAY LONG HUNTING FOR WORMS AND INSECTS FOR HIS CHILDREN WHILE HIS WIFE NURSES THEM IN THE NEST WHY TOO DID HE HELP HER TO BUILD THAT NEST WITH TOIL AND CARE THIS SPRING
BUT THIS LAND WAS TILLED FOR CORN FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS I BELIEVE AND JUST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT WAS LAID DOWN IN GRASS THAT IS SOWN WITH GRASS SEEDS AND WHERE DID MEN GET THE GRASS SEEDS FROM
WELL AND THIS HAY FIELD IS A MANUFACTORY
AND WANTED TO GO AGAIN AND MAKE OUT THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE COUNTRY FROM CARY'S OLD COUNTY MAPS WHICH WERE THE ONLY MAPS IN THOSE DAYS AND THEN BECAUSE THE HILL WAS CALLED CAMP MOUNT HE LOOKED FOR A ROMAN CAMP AND FOUND ONE AND THEN HE WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER SAW TWENTY THINGS MORE
WELL DONE BUT WHY DO YOU THINK SO
WHO PLANTED THAT TREE I KNOW NOT IT WAS PLANTED SO LONG AGO BUT SURELY IT IS NONE OF GOD'S PLANTING NEITHER OF THE SON OF GOD YET IT GROWS IN ALL LANDS AND IN ALL CLIMES AND SENDS ITS HIDDEN SUCKERS FAR AND WIDE EVEN
AND OTHER GASES EXPANDING THAT IS SPREADING OUT WITH WONDERFUL QUICKNESS AND STRENGTH OF COURSE THERE MUST BE SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM EXPAND AND THAT IS HEAT BUT WE WILL NOT TALK OF THAT YET
FOR THE SAKE OF A SET OF NESTLINGS WHO CAN BE OF NO GAIN OR USE TO HIM BUT ONLY TAKE THE FOOD OUT OF HIS MOUTH SIMPLY OUT OF WHAT SHALL I CALL IT MY CHILD LOVE THAT SAME SENSE OF LOVE AND DUTY
AND THERE I HAD A DREAM SUCH A DREAM AS ALICE HAD WHEN SHE WENT INTO WONDERLAND SUCH A DREAM AS I DARE SAY YOU MAY HAVE HAD ERE NOW SOME NOISE OR STIR PUTS INTO YOUR FANCY AS YOU SLEEP
COMING SURELY FROM THAT ONE FOUNTAIN OF ALL DUTY AND ALL LOVE WHICH MAKES YOUR FATHER WORK FOR YOU THAT THE MOTHER SHOULD TAKE CARE OF HER YOUNG IS WONDERFUL ENOUGH BUT THAT AT LEAST AMONG MANY BIRDS
AND LET US LOOK NOW AT THE WORLD OF LIGHT AND LIFE AND BEAUTY WHICH BEGINS HERE AT THE OPEN DOOR AND STRETCHES AWAY OVER THE HAY FIELDS OVER THE WOODS OVER THE SOUTHERN MOORS OVER SUNNY FRANCE AND SUNNIER SPAIN
OUT OF EACH OF WHICH POURED IN FOAMING WATERFALLS STREAMS LARGE ENOUGH TO TURN A MILL AND ABOVE THEM MOUNTAINS PILED ON MOUNTAINS
SO PERHAPS THE TOP SOILS WERE ONCE BOTH ALIKE I KNOW WELL AND WHAT
AND THAT HAY AND CORN MUST BE PUT BACK AGAIN INTO THE LAND BY MANURE
AND THOUGH I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THE REASONS OF THINGS OR SHOW YOU AUGHT BUT A TINY GLIMPSE HERE AND THERE OF THAT WHICH I CALLED THE OTHER DAY THE GLORY OF LADY WHY YET I BELIEVE THAT SOMEHOW SOMEWHEN SOMEWHERE
AND WHEN HE SET FADE INTO DULL COLD GRAY TILL THE BRIGHT MOON CAME OUT TO LIGHT THEM UP ONCE MORE WHEN I WAS TIRED OF WONDERING AND ADMIRING I WENT INTO BED
THERE ARE HARDLY ANY GRASSES ON THE MOOR SAVE DEER'S HAIR AND GLADE GRASS
IF PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY ENOUGH THEY ARE OFTEN TEMPTED TO DO MANY WRONG DEEDS AND TO THINK MANY WRONG THOUGHTS AND IF BY GOD'S GRACE THEY KNOW THE LAWS OF LADY WHY AND KEEP FROM SIN STILL
WHEREON MISTER ANDREWS SAYS WISELY ENOUGH IN HIS SOLEMN OLD FASHIONED WAY
WE MUST BE VERY SHORT SIGHTED OR VERY SHALLOW HEARTED THERE IS THE OLD COCK STARLING SCREECHING IN THE EAVES BECAUSE HE WANTS TO FRIGHTEN US AWAY AND TAKE A WORM TO HIS CHILDREN WITHOUT OUR FINDING OUT WHEREABOUTS HIS HOLE IS
BECOME A GREAT RICH AND HAPPY NATION INSTEAD OF THE IDLE AND USELESS
TILL THEY STOOD OUT AT LAST IN A JAGGED SAW EDGE AGAINST THE PURPLE EVENING SKY ALONG THE MOUNTAIN RANGES THOUSANDS OF FEET ALOFT AND BEYOND THEM AGAIN AT THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY ROSE VAST CONES OF VIRGIN SNOW
AND SO IT WAS WITH ME I DREAMED THAT SOME ENGLISH PEOPLE HAD COME INTO THE HOTEL WHERE I WAS AND WERE SLEEPING IN THE ROOM UNDERNEATH ME AND THAT THEY HAD QUARRELLED AND FOUGHT AND BROKE THEIR BED DOWN WITH A TREMENDOUS CRASH
TO CRIPPLE THEM IN THEIR OLD AGE YOU DELIGHT IN MACHINERY BECAUSE IT IS CURIOUS YOU SHOULD DELIGHT IN IT BESIDES BECAUSE IT DOES GOOD AND NOTHING BUT GOOD WHERE IT IS USED ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF LADY WHY WITH CARE
BY HIS SENSES AND HIS BRAIN AND THE BETTER YOU LEARN WHAT THEY CAN TEACH YOU THE MORE FIT YOU WILL BE TO LEARN WHAT THEY CANNOT TEACH YOU THE MORE YOU TRY NOW TO UNDERSTAND THINGS THE MORE YOU WILL BE ABLE HEREAFTER TO UNDERSTAND MEN
BUT REMEMBER THIS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPINESS IS THEN IF YOU WISH TO PLEASE LADY WHY AND LADY WHY'S LORD AND KING LIKEWISE YOU WILL NEVER PASS A LITTLE CHILD WITHOUT TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPIER EVEN BY A PASSING SMILE
OR BY THE SLAG AND CINDERS WHICH LAY ALL ABOUT THEM TILL THE MOUNTAIN BLEW UP AND DESTROYED THEM MISERABLY THEN I THINK THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE EXPECTED AN EARTHQUAKE WELL IT IS NOT FOR US TO JUDGE ANY ONE
AND OVER THE TROPIC SEAS DOWN TO THE EQUATOR AND THE PALM GROVES OF THE ETERNAL SUMMER IF WE CANNOT FIND SOMETHING EVEN AT STARTING FROM THE OPEN DOOR TO TEACH US ABOUT WHY AND HOW
A LIVE MANURE CART YES CHILD IF YOU HAD SEEN AS I HAVE SEEN IN FOREIGN LANDS POOR WOMEN HAGGARD DIRTY GROWN OLD BEFORE THEIR YOUTH WAS OVER
LADY WHY AND MADAM HOW LIKEWISE WILL SURELY AVENGE THE WRONGS OF THEIR HUMAN SISTER THERE YOU DO NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND I DO NOT CARE THAT YOU SHOULD
AFTER MANY FAILURES THEY HAVE GROWN SO CAREFUL AND SO CLEVER THAT YOU MAY SEND TO CERTAIN SHOPS SAYING WHAT SORT OF SOIL YOURS IS
AS YOU HAVE USED THE EYES AND THE COMMON SENSE WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN YOU AND HAVE CONSIDERED THE LILIES OF THE FIELD HOW THEY GROW
BUT SHALL I BE MISERABLE IF I DO NOT FIND OUT SUCH LITTLE THINGS AS THIS YOU WILL BE MISERABLE IF YOU DO NOT LEARN TO UNDERSTAND LITTLE THINGS BECAUSE THEN YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND GREAT THINGS WHEN YOU MEET THEM
THERE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME I TRUST THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND ME SOME DAY MEANWHILE I THINK I ONLY SAY I THINK YOU KNOW I TOLD YOU HOW HUMBLE WE MUST BE WHENEVER WE SPEAK OF LADY WHY
CHILDREN TOO WHO ARE UNHAPPY CHILDREN WHO ARE BULLIED AND FRIGHTENED AND KEPT DULL AND SILENT NEVER THRIVE THEIR BODIES DO NOT THRIVE FOR THEY GROW UP WEAK THEIR MINDS DO NOT THRIVE FOR THEY GROW UP DULL THEIR SOULS DO NOT THRIVE
AND WRAPPED ME IN THE BEDCLOTHES AND CARRIED ME OUT HE WAS SO TALL AND STRONG AND FINE HIS FACE WAS AS ROUGH AS A SCRUBBING BRUSH AND HE TALKED SOFT AND KIND AND SMELLED OF SCHNAPPS HE TOOK ME ON HIS HORSE BEFORE HIM
WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY IT WOULD OFFER TO CALLIOPE HE HAD ONLY TO STEP OUT THE OTHER DOOR MOUNT THE TRAIN AND AWAY ABANDONING HIS BREASTWORK BUCK WITH HIS GUN READY DASHED UP THE STEPS AND INTO THE ROOM
SCOLD AT THE MILLINERY BILLS OF HIS WOMEN FOLK SUCH RECOURSE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO THE DENIZENS OF QUICKSAND CALLIOPE ESPECIALLY
HER MAMMA IS VERY ANXIOUS TO HEAR AGAIN YES SAID OLD MAN BALLINGER THAR'S A LETTER FOR MISSUS HELTERSKELTER OR SOME SICH NAME TOMMY RYAN BRUNG IT OVER WHEN HE COME HER LITTLE GAL WORKIN OVER THAR YOU SAY
THE CATTLEMAN WAS CAUGHT IN A STAMPEDE OF DOLLARS IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD MORE MONEY THAN WAS DECENT BUT WHEN HE HAD BOUGHT A WATCH WITH PRECIOUS STONES SET IN THE CASE SO LARGE THAT THEY HURT HIS RIBS AND A CALIFORNIA SADDLE WITH SILVER NAILS AND ANGORA SKIN SUADEROS
HERE HIS RUMINATIONS WERE SCATTERED BY THE SUDDEN FLASH AND REPORT OF PISTOLS AND A WHOOPING AS IF FROM A WHOLE TRIBE OF INDIANS A BAND OF GALLOPING CENTAURS CLOSED IN AROUND THE MAIL WAGON ONE OF THEM LEANED OVER THE FRONT WHEEL
THEY LOST SLEEP AND DID NOT WORK BRISKLY THE NEXT DAY CAN ONE ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD LIVING AWAY FROM ONE'S MAMMA
THERE'S BIG MONEY GOES THROUGH THE MAILS TO THAT TOWN THEM DUTCH RISK A THOUSAND DOLLARS SENT WRAPPED IN A PIECE OF PAPER BEFORE THEY'D PAY THE BANKS TO HANDLE THE MONEY HONDO BILL SIX FEET TWO GENTLE OF VOICE AND IMPULSIVE IN ACTION
FOLLOWING CLOSE UPON HIS VOCIFERATION CAME THREE SHOTS FROM HIS FORTY FIVE BY WAY OF LIMBERING UP THE GUNS AND TESTING HIS AIM
LOOKING AND LISTENING SOON HE SAID HE MUST LEAVE BEFORE DAYLIGHT WHEN IT IS DARK AND STILLEST AND THEN HE SEEMED TO SUSPECT THAT I BE NOT TRUE TO HIM HE LOOKED AT ME SO STRANGE THAT I AM FRIGHTENED I SWEAR TO HIM THAT I LOVE HIM
WAS HALF CARMEN HALF MADONNA AND THE REST OH YES A WOMAN WHO IS HALF CARMEN AND HALF MADONNA CAN ALWAYS BE SOMETHING MORE THE REST LET US SAY WAS HUMMING BIRD SHE LIVED IN A GRASS ROOFED JACAL
THEY WERE THE GRANDEES OF THE GRASS KINGS OF THE KINE LORDS OF THE LEA BARONS OF BEEF AND BONE THEY MIGHT HAVE RIDDEN IN GOLDEN CHARIOTS HAD THEIR TASTES SO INCLINED
HE HITS BUCK PATTERSON TALL MUSCULAR AND SOLEMN FACED WITH HIS BRIGHT CITY MARSHAL BADGE SHINING ON THE BREAST OF HIS BLUE FLANNEL SHIRT GAVE HIS POSSE DIRECTIONS FOR THE ONSLAUGHT UPON CALLIOPE
AND THEN HE PUT AN ARM AROUND THE OLD WOMAN AND DREW HER CLOSE TO HIM SHE SMILED THE UNCHANGING MOTHER SMILE OF THREE SCORE YEARS AND PATTED HIS BIG BROWN HAND WITH HER CROOKED MITTENED FINGERS WHILE HER SON SPAKE
DRIVING UPON THE CLOSED DOOR WITH ONE HEAVE OF HIS WEIGHTY SHOULDER THE MEMBERS OF THE POSSE HEARD ONE SHOT FIRED INSIDE AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE AT LENGTH THE WOUNDED MAN OPENED HIS EYES
COVERED THE DRIVER WITH HIS REVOLVER AND ORDERED HIM TO STOP OTHERS CAUGHT AT THE BRIDLES OF DONDER AND BLITZEN DONNERWETTER SHOUTED FRITZ WITH ALL HIS TREMENDOUS VOICE WASS IST RELEASE YOUR HANDS FROM DOSE MULES
IN THE HOTEL SHOUTED FRITZ AS HE GATHERED UP THE LINES ELEVEN YEARS OLD AND NOT BIGGER AS A FRANKFURTER THE CLOSE FIST OF A PETER HILDESMULLER SOME DAY I SHALL WITH A BIG CLUB POUND THAT MAN'S DUMMKOPF
SPIEL ZWEI BIER VAMOOSE HONDO REACHED OUT AND GAVE BLITZEN A SMART CUT WITH HIS QUIRT THE LITTLE MULES SPRANG AHEAD GLAD TO BE MOVING AGAIN FRITZ URGED THEM ALONG HIMSELF DIZZY AND MUDDLED OVER HIS FEARFUL ADVENTURE
THEN A LOUD YELL AND A GREAT CLATTER OF HOOFS AS THEY GALLOPED PELL MELL BACK ALONG THE FREDERICKSBURG ROAD FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS FRITZ SAT AGAINST HIS TREE TIGHTLY BUT NOT PAINFULLY BOUND THEN FROM THE REACTION AFTER HIS EXCITING ADVENTURE HE SANK INTO SLUMBER
WELL I HAVEN'T BEEN USUALLY REGARDED AS A JACK RABBIT WHEN IT COMES TO SCRAPPING BUT I DON'T WANT A POSSE SMOKING ME OUT WHEN I'M IN YOUR JACAL SOMEBODY MIGHT GET HURT THAT OUGHTN'T TO REMAIN WITH YOUR TONIA NO ONE WILL FIND YOU HERE
THE KID'S HANDY WITH HIS GUN SURE ENOUGH ADMITTED SANDRIDGE BUT WHEN I COME FOR HIM I SHALL COME ALONE I'LL GET HIM BY MYSELF OR NOT AT ALL THE CAP WROTE ONE OR TWO THINGS TO ME THAT MAKE ME WANT TO DO THE TRICK WITHOUT ANY HELP
IT WARPS ITSELF A THOUSAND TIMES ABOUT WHAT LOOK TO BE OPEN AND INVITING PATHS ONLY TO LURE THE RIDER INTO BLIND AND IMPASSABLE SPINE DEFENDED BOTTOMS OF THE BAG LEAVING HIM TO RETREAT IF HE CAN
THE KID WAS TWENTY FIVE LOOKED TWENTY
GO IN AND REST AND LET ME WATER YOUR HORSE AND STAKE HIM WITH THE LONG ROPE THERE IS COOL WATER IN THE JAR FOR YOU THE KID KISSED HER AFFECTIONATELY NOT IF THE COURT KNOWS ITSELF DO I LET A LADY STAKE MY HORSE FOR ME SAID HE BUT IF YOU'LL RUN IN CHICA
THE ROAN KNOWING HIS PART STOOD STILL MAKING NO SOUND THE KID CREPT NOISELESSLY TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE PEAR THICKET AND RECONNOITRED BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF A CLUMP OF CACTUS TEN YARDS FROM HIS HIDING PLACE
HE MOODILY SHOT UP A SALOON IN A SMALL COW VILLAGE ON QUINTANA CREEK KILLED THE TOWN MARSHAL PLUGGING HIM NEATLY IN THE CENTRE OF HIS TIN BADGE AND THEN RODE AWAY MOROSE AND UNSATISFIED
FRITZ STARED AT HER WITH EYES THAT BULGED BEHIND HIS SPECTACLES GOTT IN HIMMEL HE SHOUTED HOW DID YOU GET IN THAT WAGON AM I GOING CRAZY AS WELL AS TO BE MURDERED AND HANGED BY ROBBERS THIS DAY
SLOWLY PUSHING THIS LOADED TRUCK BEFORE HIM FOR PROTECTION THE POSSE SCATTERING BROADLY STOOD READY TO NIP THE BESIEGED IN CASE HE SHOULD SHOW HIMSELF IN AN EFFORT TO REPEL THE JUGGERNAUT OF JUSTICE THAT WAS CREEPING UPON HIM
THE PRINCE BROUGHT ME SAID LENA CONFIDENTLY AND TO THIS DAY THE GOOD PEOPLE OF FREDERICKSBURG
OF SUFFICIENT POLITENESS FOR TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE MISS'S HEALTH ARE YOU NOW YOU GO ON AND YOU READ THAT SCRATCHIN OUT LOUD AND IN PLAIN UNITED STATES LANGUAGE TO THIS HERE COMPANY OF EDUCATED SOCIETY
TO CONVINCE YOU THAT I AM SINCERE SAYS THE SHEEP MAN I'LL ASK YOU TO HELP ME MISS LEARIGHT AND YOU BEING CLOSER FRIENDS MAYBE SHE WOULD DO FOR YOU WHAT SHE WOULDN'T FOR ME IF YOU WILL GET ME A COPY OF THAT PANCAKE RECIPE I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT I'LL NEVER CALL UPON HER AGAIN
THAT THE SPECKLED ROAN WOULD BRING THE KID TO SEE HIS GIRL AND ONCE CLINGING LIKE A LIZARD TO THE RIDGE POLE HIGH UP UNDER THE PEAKED GRASS ROOF HE HAD HEARD TONIA WITH HER MADONNA FACE AND CARMEN BEAUTY AND HUMMING BIRD SOUL PARLEY WITH THE SHERIFF'S POSSE
TOMMY WAS STILL WAITING FAITHFULLY WHEN THE LETTER WAS CONCLUDED AND WHEN LENA DROPPED IT OUT SHE SAW HIM PICK IT UP AND START UP THE STEEP HILLSIDE WITHOUT UNDRESSING SHE BLEW OUT THE CANDLE AND CURLED HERSELF UPON THE MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR
A CALL LOAN IN THOSE DAYS THE CATTLEMEN WERE THE ANOINTED
WHAT WOULD I DO WITH A WIFE
PETER HAD AN AMBITION TO BECOME AS RICH AS HIS NEIGHBOUR HUGO HEFFELBAUER WHO SMOKED A MEERSCHAUM PIPE THREE FEET LONG AND HAD WIENER SCHNITZEL AND HASSENPFEFFER FOR DINNER EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK
WHILE STROLLING ABOUT HE REACHED OFTEN FOR TWIGS OF MESQUITE AND CHEWED THE LEAVES FIERCELY THAT WAS ALWAYS AN OMINOUS ACT ANOTHER SYMPTOM ALARMING TO THOSE WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF HIS DOLDRUMS
HEAVY ODOURS OF STEWED MEAT HOT GREASE AND CHEAP COFFEE HUNG LIKE A DEPRESSING FOG ABOUT THE HOUSE LENA LIT THE STUMP OF A CANDLE AND SAT LIMPLY UPON HER WOODEN CHAIR SHE WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD THIN
SANDRIDGE SADDLED HIS HORSE AND RODE TO THE LONE WOLF CROSSING HE TIED HIS BIG DUN IN A CLUMP OF BRUSH ON THE ARROYO TOOK HIS WINCHESTER FROM ITS SCABBARD AND CAREFULLY APPROACHED THE PEREZ JACAL
A TREMENDOUS FOREST OF BRISTLING PEAR TWENTY FEET HIGH AT ITS WORST CROWDED ALMOST TO ITS DOOR
IT'S THE ONLY TUNE HE KNOWS SHOUTED MERWIN AS HE RAN
PROVIDING THAT THE LIVES OF THE MORE USEFUL CITIZENS WERE NOT RECKLESSLY SQUANDERED OR TOO MUCH PROPERTY NEEDLESSLY LAID WASTE THE COMMUNITY SENTIMENT WAS AGAINST A TOO STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW BUT CALLIOPE HAD RAISED THE LIMIT
HIS OUTBURSTS HAD BEEN TOO FREQUENT AND TOO VIOLENT TO COME WITHIN THE CLASSIFICATION OF A NORMAL AND SANITARY RELAXATION OF SPIRIT
I WAS FEELING LIKE ADAM BEFORE THE APPLE STAMPEDE AND WAS DIGGING MY SPURS INTO THE SIDE OF THE COUNTER AND WORKING WITH MY TWENTY FOUR INCH SPOON WHEN I HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO THE YARD OF UNCLE EMSLEY'S HOUSE WHICH WAS NEXT TO THE STORE
THE HOLY LAND I SAYS TO MYSELF MY THOUGHTS MILLING SOME AS I TRIED TO RUN EM INTO THE CORRAL WHY NOT THERE WAS SURE ANGELS IN PALES
NOT FAR AWAY WAS THE LITTLE RAILROAD STATION ITS BUILDING A STRONG BOX HOUSE TEN BY TWENTY FEET RESTING UPON A PLATFORM FOUR FEET ABOVE GROUND WINDOWS WERE IN EACH OF ITS WALLS
BUT THIS KID'S GOT A HALF MEXICAN GIRL AT THE CROSSING THAT HE COMES TO SEE SHE LIVES IN THAT JACAL A HUNDRED YARDS DOWN THE ARROYO AT THE EDGE OF THE PEAR MAYBE SHE NO I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE WOULD
OFTEN STRAINED IN EXTENDING LENIENCY TOWARD THE DISTURBER'S MISDEEDS HAD BEEN OVERTAXED IN QUICKSAND SOME INDULGENCE WAS ACCORDED THE NATURAL EBULLITION OF HUMAN NATURE
BY MEANS OF SOME FORDABLE SPOT ON THE RIO GRANDE THE BOOTY FROM THE TRAIN HAD MELTED THE DESPERATE BUSHRANGERS TO JOVIAL AND HAPPY SKYLARKERS TREMBLING WITH OUTRAGED DIGNITY AND NO LITTLE PERSONAL APPREHENSION
BUT THE BOYS KEPT THE RACKET UP DID YOU MAKE THESE CAKES BY THE FAMOUS RECIPE I ASKED
THE STATION AGENT LEAVING THE BUILDING BY A WINDOW LIKE A FLYING SQUIRREL AS THE GARRISON ENTERED THE DOOR PATTERSON AND HIS SUPPORTERS HALTED UNDER PROTECTION OF A PILE OF LUMBER AND HELD CONSULTATIONS IN THE STATION WAS AN UNTERRIFIED DESPERADO
HE PAUSED AT THE NEAREST CORNER AND EMITTED HIS SLOGAN THAT FEARFUL BRASSY YELL SO REMINISCENT OF THE STEAM PIANO THAT HAD GAINED FOR HIM THE CLASSIC APPELLATION THAT HAD SUPERSEDED HIS OWN BAPTISMAL NAME
HIS EYES STEADY AND KEEN SEEMED TO LINGER UPON THE FACE OF THE MAN STANDING SO STILL ABOVE HIM HIS LOOK WANDERED OFTEN FROM THE FACE HE STUDIED TO THE MARSHAL'S BADGE UPON THE OTHER'S BREAST
ONE DAY I GALLOPED OVER TO THE STORE WITH A FINE BUNCH OF BLUE VERBENAS THAT I CUT OUT OF A HERD OF WILD FLOWERS OVER ON POISONED DOG PRAIRIE UNCLE EMSLEY LOOKED AT EM WITH ONE EYE SHUT AND SAYS HAVEN'T YE HEARD THE NEWS
SANDRIDGE QUICKLY EXPLAINED TO HIS MEN THE OFFICIAL PART OF THE MISSIVE THE RANGERS PROTESTED AGAINST HIS GOING ALONE I'LL GET HIM EASY ENOUGH SAID THE LIEUTENANT THE GIRL'S GOT HIM TRAPPED AND DON'T EVEN THINK HE'LL GET THE DROP ON ME
CANNONADING ON EITHER SIDE WHEN HE SUDDENLY BECAME AWARE OF BREAKERS AHEAD
WAS HIS INCREASING POLITENESS AND A TENDENCY TO USE FORMAL PHRASES A HUSKY SOFTNESS SUCCEEDED THE USUAL PENETRATING DRAWL IN HIS TONES A DANGEROUS COURTESY MARKED HIS MANNERS LATER
HE REMAINS TWO DAYS SOMETIMES THREE GREGORIO THE SMALL SON OF OLD LUISA THE LAVENDERA HAS A SWIFT PONY I WILL WRITE A LETTER TO THEE AND SEND IT BY HIM SAYING HOW IT WILL BE BEST TO COME UPON HIM
JACKSON BIRD TOLD ME HE WAS CALLING ON MISS WILLELLA FOR THE PURPOSE OF FINDING OUT HER SYSTEM OF PRODUCING PANCAKES
ONLY ONCE DID CALLIOPE MAKE DEMONSTRATION HE FIRED FROM A WINDOW AND SOME TUFTS OF WOOL SPURTED FROM THE MARSHAL'S TRUSTWORTHY BULWARK THE RETURN SHOTS FROM THE POSSE PATTERED AGAINST THE WINDOW FRAME OF THE FORT NO LOSS RESULTED
THIS GOODLY PROMONTORY THE EARTH
IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED FREDERICKSBURG THEY ARE ALL GERMAN PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FREDERICKSBURG OF EVENINGS THEY SIT AT LITTLE TABLES ALONG THE SIDEWALK AND DRINK BEER AND PLAY PINOCHLE AND SCAT THEY ARE VERY THRIFTY PEOPLE
DON'T YOU MONKEY WITH MY LULU GIRL OR I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO AND SO ON THE ROAN WAS INURED TO IT AND DID NOT MIND
AND LIEUTENANT SANDRIDGE SAT IN HIS SADDLE STARING AT HER LIKE A GANNET AGAPE AT A SAILORMAN THE CISCO KID WAS A VAIN PERSON AS ALL EMINENT AND SUCCESSFUL ASSASSINS ARE AND HIS BOSOM WOULD HAVE BEEN RUFFLED
OUT OF THE CHAPARRAL CAME LONG BILL LONGLEY FROM THE BAR CIRCLE BRANCH ON THE FRIO A WIFE DRIVEN MAN TO TASTE THE URBAN JOYS OF SUCCESS
I AM GOING TO HILLDALE'S TO NIGHT HE TOLD LONGLEY TO EXAMINE A BANK THERE I WILL PASS THROUGH CHAPAROSA ON MY WAY BACK AT TWELVE O'CLOCK TO MORROW I SHALL CALL AT THIS BANK
JACKSON SAID THAT WHENEVER YOU GOT OVERHOT OR EXCITED THAT WOUND HURT YOU AND MADE YOU KIND OF CRAZY AND YOU WENT RAVING ABOUT PANCAKES
BUT THE SON OF A GUN SLIPPED IN ON US TOM NOW I'M SHORT OF CASH MYSELF JUST NOW OR I'D LET YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO TAKE IT UP WITH I'VE GOT TILL TWELVE O'CLOCK TO MORROW AND THEN I'VE GOT TO SHOW THE CASH IN PLACE OF THAT NOTE OR
WAS AWAKENED BY THE SHOTS LISTENING FURTHER HE HEARD A GREAT CRY FROM SOME MAN IN MORTAL DISTRESS OR ANGUISH AND ROSE UP GRUMBLING AT THE DISTURBING WAYS OF MODERNS
AND ORDERED EVERYBODY UP TO THE BAR FOR WHISKY WHAT ELSE WAS THERE FOR HIM TO SPEND MONEY FOR NOT SO CIRCUMSCRIBED IN EXPEDIENT FOR THE REDUCTION OF SURPLUS WEALTH WERE THOSE LAIRDS OF THE LARIAT WHO HAD WOMENFOLK TO THEIR NAME
HIS SMILE BECAME CROOKED THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS MOUTH SLANTING UPWARD AND QUICKSAND GOT READY TO STAND FROM UNDER AT THIS STAGE CALLIOPE GENERALLY BEGAN TO DRINK FINALLY ABOUT MIDNIGHT
DON'T YOU TAKE IT AS MEDDLESOME FER AN OLD WOMAN WITH A SON AS BIG AS YOU TO TALK ABOUT IT
AND AN IRON HAND GRASPING EACH OF HIS WRISTS HE WAS HELD THUS LIKE A CHILD UNTIL THE ENGINE HAD TAKEN WATER AND UNTIL THE TRAIN HAD MOVED WITH ACCELERATING SPEED OUT OF SIGHT
IN THE BREAST OF THE RIB SPRUNG SEX THE GENIUS OF PURSE LIGHTENING MAY SLUMBER THROUGH YEARS OF INOPPORTUNITY BUT NEVER MY BROTHERS DOES IT BECOME EXTINCT SO
THE CISCO KID HAD KILLED SIX MEN IN MORE OR LESS FAIR SCRIMMAGES HAD MURDERED TWICE AS MANY MOSTLY MEXICANS AND HAD WINGED A LARGER NUMBER WHOM HE MODESTLY FORBORE TO COUNT
THAT IS A BAD HABIT YOU HAVE GOT OF RIDING WITH YOUNG LADIES OVER AT PIMIENTA I'VE KNOWN BIRDS SAYS I TO BE SERVED ON TOAST FOR LESS THAN THAT
OR WHAT BILL ASKED MERWIN AS LONGLEY HESITATED WELL I SUPPOSE IT MEANS BE JUMPED ON WITH BOTH OF UNCLE SAM'S FEET I'LL TRY TO RAISE THE MONEY FOR YOU ON TIME SAID MERWIN INTERESTED IN HIS PLAITING
ONE TWO THREE AND THEN TWICE MORE FOR YOU NEVER COULD BE TOO SURE OF BRINGING DOWN THE CISCO KID THERE WAS NO DANGER OF MISSING AT TEN PACES EVEN IN THAT HALF MOONLIGHT THE OLD ANCESTOR ASLEEP ON HIS BLANKET
CLERKS WERE PUTTING UP SHUTTERS AND CLOSING DOORS BUSINESS WOULD LANGUISH FOR A SPACE THE RIGHT OF WAY WAS CALLIOPE'S AND AS HE ADVANCED OBSERVING THE DEARTH OF OPPOSITION AND THE FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISTRACTION
MARRIED YESTERDAY SAYS UNCLE EMSLEY AND GONE TO WACO AND NIAGARA FALLS ON A WEDDING TOUR WHY DIDN'T YOU SEE NONE OF THE SIGNS ALL ALONG JACKSON BIRD HAS BEEN COURTING WILLELLA EVER SINCE THAT DAY HE TOOK HER OUT RIDING
YOU BROUGHT HER TO US FRITZ CRIED FRAU HILDESMULLER HOW CAN WE EVER THANK YOU ENOUGH TELL MAMMA HOW YOU CAME IN FRITZ'S WAGON SAID FRAU HILDESMULLER
YOU FOLLOW THAT ADVICE SHE GIVE ME
COOPER BEGAN TO COUGH NOW FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T SAY NO SAID MERWIN I OWE THAT MUCH MONEY ON A CALL LOAN IT'S BEEN CALLED AND THE MAN THAT CALLED IT IS A MAN I'VE LAID ON THE SAME BLANKET WITH IN COW CAMPS AND RANGER CAMPS FOR TEN YEARS HE CAN CALL ANYTHING I'VE GOT HE CAN CALL THE BLOOD OUT OF MY VEINS AND IT'LL COME HE'S GOT TO HAVE THE MONEY HE'S IN A DEVIL OF A
HE DROVE THE BEGUILED EASTERNER IN BUCKBOARDS OUT TO LOOK OVER LOTS AND RANCH PROPERTY ORIGINALLY HE CAME FROM ONE OF THE GULF STATES HIS LANK SIX FEET SLURRING RHYTHM OF SPEECH AND SECTIONAL IDIOMS GIVING EVIDENCE OF HIS BIRTHPLACE
THE SPORT OF THE WANTON BREEZES THE ARTILLERY WAS IN TRIM CALLIOPE'S HAND WAS STEADY THE HIGH CALM ECSTASY OF HABITUAL BATTLE WAS UPON HIM THOUGH SLIGHTLY EMBITTERED BY THE SADNESS OF ALEXANDER
BUCK PATTERSON HAD BEEN EXPECTING AND AWAITING IN HIS LITTLE TEN BY TWELVE FRAME OFFICE THAT PRELIMINARY YELL ANNOUNCING THAT CALLIOPE WAS FEELING BLUE
AND SORT OF PARALYSED YE FOR A SPELL
HONDO TWIRLED HIS SIX SHOOTER BY ITS TRIGGER GUARD AND STOOD TOWERING ABOVE THE LITTLE GERMAN WHO AT ONCE BEGAN TO READ THE LETTER TRANSLATING THE SIMPLE WORDS INTO ENGLISH THE GANG OF ROVERS STOOD IN ABSOLUTE SILENCE LISTENING INTENTLY
CATTLE UP I ASKS WILLELLA AND JACKSON BIRD WAS MARRIED IN PALESTINE YESTERDAY SAYS HE JUST GOT A LETTER THIS MORNING
WINDING TWISTING CIRCLING TRACING THE MOST FANTASTIC AND BEWILDERING TRAIL EVER PICKED OUT THE GOOD ROAN LESSENED THE DISTANCE TO THE LONE WOLF CROSSING WITH EVERY COIL AND TURN THAT HE MADE WHILE THEY FARED THE KID SANG
I SLID OVER THE COUNTER AFTER UNCLE EMSLEY HE GRABBED AT HIS GUN BUT IT WAS IN A DRAWER AND HE MISSED IT TWO INCHES I GOT HIM BY THE FRONT OF HIS SHIRT AND SHOVED HIM IN A CORNER TALK PANCAKES SAYS I OR BE MADE INTO ONE
THE PAIR OF MULES DESERVING TO BE RECKONED INDIVIDUALLY THOSE MULES WERE THE CHIEF INTEREST AND JOY OF HIS EXISTENCE NEXT CAME THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY AND LENA HILDESMULLER TELL ME SAID FRITZ WHEN HE WAS READY TO START
AND THEY MEAN TO KILL YOU BEFORE YOU CAN REACH HOME I DO NOT MUCH THINK THEY WILL SUCCEED IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE NOW EATING UP YOUR PROPERTY WILL FIND A GRAVE THEMSELVES SAIL NIGHT AND DAY AND KEEP YOUR SHIP WELL AWAY FROM THE ISLANDS
AND REQUITE YOUR KINDNESSES CONFERRED UPON HIM BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE HIM FULL VICTORY AS YET FOR SHE WISHED STILL FURTHER TO PROVE HIS OWN PROWESS AND THAT OF HIS BRAVE SON
BUT LET US SEE WHETHER YOU CAN STRING THE BOW OR NO I TOO WILL MAKE TRIAL OF IT FOR IF I CAN STRING IT AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON I SHALL NOT SUFFER MY MOTHER TO QUIT THIS HOUSE WITH A STRANGER
THIS WILL STOP THEM FROM ESCORTING PEOPLE IN FUTURE AND I SHOULD ALSO LIKE TO BURY THEIR CITY UNDER A HUGE MOUNTAIN MY GOOD FRIEND ANSWERED JOVE I SHOULD RECOMMEND YOU AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE PEOPLE FROM THE CITY ARE WATCHING THE SHIP ON HER WAY
WHOSE WAVES HE SKIMMED LIKE A CORMORANT THAT FLIES FISHING EVERY HOLE AND CORNER OF THE OCEAN AND DRENCHING ITS THICK PLUMAGE IN THE SPRAY HE FLEW AND FLEW OVER MANY A WEARY WAVE BUT WHEN AT LAST
IT HAS TWO ENTRANCES ONE FACING NORTH BY WHICH MORTALS CAN GO DOWN INTO THE CAVE WHILE THE OTHER COMES FROM THE SOUTH AND IS MORE MYSTERIOUS MORTALS CANNOT POSSIBLY GET IN BY IT IT IS THE WAY TAKEN BY THE GODS INTO THIS HARBOUR
ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK SO THAT HIS HEAD FELL ROLLING IN THE DUST WHILE HE WAS YET SPEAKING
TELEMACHUS SAYS YOU ARE TO CLOSE THE DOORS OF THE WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IF THEY HEAR ANY GROANING OR UPROAR AS OF MEN FIGHTING ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY ARE NOT TO COME OUT BUT ARE TO KEEP QUIET AND STAY WHERE THEY ARE AT THEIR WORK
WHEN HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE TREASURES OF HIS HOUSE WERE KEPT HE SELECTED A DOUBLE CUP
THESE SUITORS ARE A FEEBLE FOLK THEY ARE PAYING COURT TO THE WIFE OF A BRAVE MAN WHOSE BOW NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO STRING AND YET A BEGGARLY TRAMP WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE STRUNG IT AT ONCE AND SENT AN ARROW THROUGH THE IRON
HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN WITH HIM BY ULYSSES WHEN HE SAILED FOR TROY HE HAD USED IT SO LONG AS HE HAD BEEN AT HOME BUT HAD LEFT IT BEHIND AS HAVING BEEN A KEEPSAKE FROM A VALUED FRIEND
HE MADE THE RAFT AS BROAD AS A SKILLED SHIPWRIGHT
I TOO MY SON SAID SHE HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU AS A KEEPSAKE FROM THE HAND OF HELEN IT IS FOR YOUR BRIDE TO WEAR UPON HER WEDDING DAY TILL THEN GET YOUR DEAR MOTHER TO KEEP IT FOR YOU
IF HEAVEN SHALL DELIVER THE SUITORS INTO MY HANDS I WILL FIND WIVES FOR BOTH OF YOU WILL GIVE YOU HOUSE AND HOLDING CLOSE TO MY OWN AND YOU SHALL BE TO ME AS THOUGH YOU WERE BROTHERS AND FRIENDS OF TELEMACHUS
AS HE WAS THUS SPEAKING A BIRD FLEW ON HIS RIGHT HAND AN EAGLE WITH A GREAT WHITE GOOSE IN ITS TALONS WHICH IT HAD CARRIED OFF FROM THE FARM YARD AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN WERE RUNNING AFTER IT AND SHOUTING
AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOU WHEN SHE HAD THUS SPOKEN SHE LED THE WAY RAPIDLY BEFORE HIM AND ULYSSES FOLLOWED IN HER STEPS SO THE PAIR GODDESS AND MAN WENT ON AND ON TILL THEY CAME TO CALYPSO'S CAVE
FOLLOWING TELEMACHUS SHE FOUND ULYSSES AMONG THE CORPSES BESPATTERED WITH BLOOD AND FILTH LIKE A LION THAT HAS JUST BEEN DEVOURING AN OX AND HIS BREAST AND BOTH HIS CHEEKS ARE ALL BLOODY
HAS HEAVEN SENT THIS OMEN FOR US OR FOR YOU
THEN CAUGHT THE KNEES OF ULYSSES AND SAID ULYSSES I BESEECH YOU HAVE MERCY UPON ME AND SPARE ME
WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY WERE AFRAID AND GOT READY THE BULLS
SO MERCURY STOOD STILL AND LOOKED AT IT BUT WHEN HE HAD ADMIRED IT SUFFICIENTLY HE WENT INSIDE THE CAVE CALYPSO KNEW HIM AT ONCE FOR THE GODS ALL KNOW EACH OTHER NO MATTER HOW FAR THEY LIVE FROM ONE ANOTHER
IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MUST LEAVE OFF GIVING PEOPLE ESCORTS WHEN THEY COME HERE AND IN THE NEXT LET US SACRIFICE TWELVE PICKED BULLS TO NEPTUNE THAT HE MAY HAVE MERCY UPON US AND NOT BURY OUR CITY UNDER THE HIGH MOUNTAIN
LET US NOW THEREFORE PRESENT HIM FURTHER EACH ONE OF US WITH A LARGE TRIPOD AND A CAULDRON WE WILL RECOUP OURSELVES BY THE LEVY OF A GENERAL RATE
WHEN THEY HAD SATISFIED THEMSELVES WITH MEAT AND DRINK CALYPSO SPOKE SAYING
I SHALL EITHER BE ALWAYS FEEBLE AND OF NO PROWESS OR I AM TOO YOUNG AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED MY FULL STRENGTH SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HOLD MY OWN IF ANY ONE ATTACKS ME YOU OTHERS THEREFORE WHO ARE STRONGER THAN I
OR WAKES THEM JUST AS HE PLEASES
SAID HE LET ME GO BACK NOW TO MY OWN COUNTRY FOR I WANT TO GET HOME
AND TURNED HITHER AND THITHER
WHO WAS ABOUT TO TAKE UP A TWO HANDLED GOLD CUP TO DRINK HIS WINE AND ALREADY HAD IT IN HIS HANDS HE HAD NO THOUGHT OF DEATH WHO AMONGST ALL THE REVELLERS WOULD THINK THAT ONE MAN HOWEVER BRAVE
OR EUMAEUS HAS ALREADY KILLED HIM OR HE HAS FALLEN IN YOUR WAY WHEN YOU WERE RAGING ABOUT THE COURT MEDON CAUGHT THESE WORDS OF TELEMACHUS FOR HE WAS CROUCHING UNDER A SEAT
LET ME TELL YOU ALSO OF ANOTHER MATTER WHICH YOU HAD BETTER ATTEND TO
INASMUCH AS HE HAD SPOKEN REASONABLY ALCINOUS THEREFORE SAID TO HIS SERVANT PONTONOUS MIX SOME WINE AND HAND IT ROUND TO EVERYBODY THAT WE MAY OFFER A PRAYER TO FATHER JOVE AND SPEED OUR GUEST UPON HIS WAY
DO NOT THEREFORE BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO CUT MY HEAD OFF YOUR OWN SON TELEMACHUS WILL TELL YOU THAT I DID NOT WANT TO FREQUENT YOUR HOUSE AND SING TO THE SUITORS AFTER THEIR MEALS BUT THEY WERE TOO MANY AND TOO STRONG FOR ME
OR KNOCK HIM DOWN SO HE SET OFF AT A RUN AND IMMEDIATELY WAS AT HIS FATHER'S SIDE THEN HE SAID FATHER LET ME BRING YOU A SHIELD TWO SPEARS AND A BRASS HELMET FOR YOUR TEMPLES
WHILE ULYSSES KISSED THEIR HANDS AND FACES IN RETURN THE SUN WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN UPON THEIR MOURNING IF ULYSSES HAD NOT CHECKED THEM AND SAID CEASE YOUR WEEPING LEST SOME ONE SHOULD COME OUTSIDE AND SEE US
WHO COULD POSSIBLY WANT TO COME ALL THIS WAY OVER THE SEA WHERE THERE ARE NO CITIES FULL OF PEOPLE TO OFFER ME SACRIFICES OR CHOICE HECATOMBS
BUT AS SOON AS THEY HAD HAD ENOUGH TO EAT AND DRINK
WHO ARE NEAR OF KIN TO THE GODS AND WILL HONOUR HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE ONE OF OURSELVES THEY WILL SEND HIM IN A SHIP TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AND WILL GIVE HIM MORE BRONZE AND GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
AND WILL SEND YOU A FAIR WIND TO TAKE YOU HOME IF THE GODS IN HEAVEN SO WILL IT FOR THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS AND CAN SETTLE THEM BETTER THAN I CAN ULYSSES SHUDDERED AS HE HEARD HER NOW GODDESS HE ANSWERED
AND TELL THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN WHEN YOU GO IN DO SO SEPARATELY NOT BOTH TOGETHER I WILL GO FIRST AND DO YOU FOLLOW AFTERWARDS LET THIS MOREOVER BE THE TOKEN BETWEEN US THE SUITORS
THEREON HE FLOATED ABOUT FOR TWO NIGHTS AND TWO DAYS IN THE WATER WITH A HEAVY SWELL ON THE SEA AND DEATH STARING HIM IN THE FACE BUT WHEN THE THIRD DAY BROKE THE WIND FELL AND THERE WAS A DEAD CALM WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A BREATH OF AIR STIRRING
THEREON MINERVA BEGAN TO TELL THEM OF THE MANY SUFFERINGS OF ULYSSES FOR SHE PITIED HIM AWAY THERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE NYMPH CALYPSO FATHER JOVE SAID SHE
HAVE MERCY UPON ME O KING FOR I DECLARE MYSELF YOUR SUPPLIANT THEN THE GOD STAID HIS STREAM AND STILLED THE WAVES MAKING ALL CALM BEFORE HIM AND BRINGING HIM SAFELY INTO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER HERE
AND MAKING ME PRESENTS WHICH HEAVEN GRANT THAT I MAY TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT
KILLED IPHITUS ERE THEY COULD DO SO THIS BOW THEN
I GRIEVE THAT I SHALL HAVE TO FORGO THE MARRIAGE BUT I DO NOT CARE NEARLY SO MUCH ABOUT THIS FOR THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WOMEN IN ITHACA AND ELSEWHERE WHAT I FEEL MOST IS THE FACT OF OUR BEING SO INFERIOR TO ULYSSES IN STRENGTH
SEEMED TO BE STILL A GOOD WAY OFF I KNOW WHAT I WILL DO I AM SURE IT WILL BE BEST NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I WILL STICK TO THE RAFT AS LONG AS HER TIMBERS HOLD TOGETHER BUT WHEN THE SEA BREAKS HER UP I WILL SWIM FOR IT
BUT PRESENTLY THE WAVE CAME ON AGAIN AND CARRIED HIM BACK WITH IT FAR INTO THE SEA TEARING HIS HANDS AS THE SUCKERS OF A POLYPUS ARE TORN WHEN SOME ONE PLUCKS IT FROM ITS BED
MOREOVER THERE ARE GREAT LOOMS OF STONE ON WHICH THE NYMPHS WEAVE THEIR ROBES OF SEA PURPLE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE AND AT ALL TIMES THERE IS WATER WITHIN IT
I WILL NOW PRESENT YOU WITH THE FINEST AND MOST PRECIOUS PIECE OF PLATE IN ALL MY HOUSE IT IS A MIXING BOWL OF PURE SILVER EXCEPT THE RIM WHICH IS INLAID WITH GOLD AND IT IS THE WORK OF VULCAN
FOR SHE SAW THAT A GREAT DEED HAD BEEN DONE BUT ULYSSES CHECKED HER OLD WOMAN SAID HE REJOICE IN SILENCE RESTRAIN YOURSELF AND DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE ABOUT IT IT IS AN UNHOLY THING
THAT HE IS OF NOBLE BIRTH GIVE HIM THE BOW AND LET US SEE WHETHER HE CAN STRING IT OR NO I SAY AND IT SHALL SURELY BE THAT IF APOLLO
AND CALYPSO WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR ULYSSES FOR SHE HAD HEARD JOVE'S MESSAGE SHE FOUND HIM SITTING UPON THE BEACH WITH HIS EYES EVER FILLED WITH TEARS AND DYING OF SHEER HOME SICKNESS
I MAY ESCAPE THE COLD AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST BUT SOME SAVAGE BEAST MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME AND DEVOUR ME
LET US THEN SHOW FIGHT
THEY BENT HIS HANDS AND FEET WELL BEHIND HIS BACK
AS IT WAS RETURNING FROM AN ESCORT AND BURY OUR CITY UNDER A HIGH MOUNTAIN
THE TWO FELL IN WITH ONE ANOTHER IN MESSENE AT THE HOUSE OF ORTILOCHUS
YOU SHALL SEE NO OTHER CONTEST YOU ARE A DOOMED MAN HE WHOM YOU HAVE SLAIN WAS THE FOREMOST YOUTH IN ITHACA AND THE VULTURES SHALL DEVOUR YOU FOR HAVING KILLED HIM
LIKE THE TWITTERING OF A SWALLOW THE SUITORS WERE DISMAYED AND TURNED COLOUR AS THEY HEARD IT AT THAT MOMENT MOREOVER JOVE THUNDERED LOUDLY AS A SIGN AND THE HEART OF ULYSSES REJOICED AS HE HEARD THE OMEN
AND IN THE END HE DEEMED IT BEST TO TURN HIS HORSES TOWARDS THE SHIP
AND THEN SAID WE ARE SPEAKING GOD AND GODDESS TO ONE ANOTHER AND YOU ASK ME WHY I HAVE COME HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU TRULY AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO JOVE SENT ME IT WAS NO DOING OF MINE
BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON
SO THAT HE FELL HEAVILY TO THE GROUND AND STRUCK THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD THEN TELEMACHUS SPRANG AWAY FROM HIM LEAVING HIS SPEAR STILL IN THE BODY FOR HE FEARED THAT IF HE STAYED TO DRAW IT OUT
HE EXCLAIMED AMONG WHAT MANNER OF PEOPLE AM I FALLEN ARE THEY SAVAGE AND UNCIVILISED OR HOSPITABLE AND HUMANE WHERE SHALL I PUT ALL THIS TREASURE AND WHICH WAY SHALL I GO
LET ANOTHER HAVE IT THIS BOW SHALL TAKE THE LIFE AND SOUL OUT OF MANY A CHIEF AMONG US FOR IT IS BETTER TO DIE THAN TO LIVE AFTER HAVING MISSED THE PRIZE THAT WE HAVE SO LONG STRIVEN FOR AND WHICH HAS BROUGHT US SO LONG TOGETHER
SOME ONE OF US IS EVEN NOW HOPING AND PRAYING THAT HE MAY MARRY PENELOPE BUT WHEN HE HAS SEEN THIS BOW AND TRIED IT LET HIM WOO AND MAKE BRIDAL OFFERINGS TO SOME OTHER WOMAN AND LET PENELOPE
CALYPSO SMILED AT THIS AND CARESSED HIM WITH HER HAND YOU KNOW A GREAT DEAL SAID SHE BUT YOU ARE QUITE WRONG HERE MAY HEAVEN ABOVE AND EARTH BELOW BE MY WITNESSES WITH THE WATERS OF THE RIVER STYX
WHEREON INO RECEIVED IT INTO HER HANDS FROM THE WAVE THAT BORE IT TOWARDS HER THEN HE LEFT THE RIVER LAID HIMSELF DOWN AMONG THE RUSHES AND KISSED
THEREON HE GATHERED HIS CLOUDS TOGETHER GRASPED HIS TRIDENT STIRRED IT ROUND IN THE SEA AND ROUSED THE RAGE OF EVERY WIND THAT BLOWS TILL EARTH SEA AND SKY WERE HIDDEN IN CLOUD AND NIGHT SPRANG FORTH OUT OF THE HEAVENS
HAS NOT VOUCHSAFED IT TO HIM HE WANTED TO KILL YOUR SON AND TO BE CHIEF MAN IN ITHACA NOW THEREFORE THAT HE HAS MET THE DEATH WHICH WAS HIS DUE SPARE THE LIVES OF YOUR PEOPLE
WHICH LIES BETWEEN TWO POINTS THAT BREAK THE LINE OF THE SEA AND SHUT THE HARBOUR IN
A VINE LOADED WITH GRAPES WAS TRAINED AND GREW LUXURIANTLY ABOUT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE
HIS ORDERS HE SAYS THAT YOU HAVE HERE THE MOST ILL STARRED OF ALL THOSE WHO FOUGHT NINE YEARS BEFORE THE CITY OF KING PRIAM AND SAILED HOME IN THE TENTH YEAR AFTER HAVING SACKED IT
BUT HE BROUGHT IT UPON HIMSELF THROUGH HIS OWN DRUNKENNESS IN LIKE MANNER I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WILL GO HARDLY WITH YOU IF YOU STRING THE BOW YOU WILL FIND NO MERCY FROM ANY ONE HERE
BUT THE GODS DELIVER HIM FROM EVIL SO WAS ULYSSES THANKFUL WHEN HE AGAIN SAW LAND AND TREES AND SWAM ON WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH THAT HE MIGHT ONCE MORE SET FOOT UPON DRY GROUND
HIS TABLE THE CUP AND ALL THE MEATS WENT OVER ON TO THE GROUND AS HE SMOTE THE EARTH WITH HIS FOREHEAD IN THE AGONIES OF DEATH AND HE KICKED THE STOOL WITH HIS FEET UNTIL HIS EYES WERE CLOSED IN DARKNESS
CAN YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD TAKE ME HOME WITH HIM
NOT EVEN A WELL FOUND SHIP WITH A FAIR WIND COULD VENTURE ON SUCH A DISTANT VOYAGE NOTHING THAT YOU CAN SAY OR DO SHALL MAKE ME GO ON BOARD A RAFT UNLESS YOU FIRST SOLEMNLY SWEAR
FROM WHAT THEY HAD IN THE HOUSE AND THE SUITORS WARMED THE BOW AND AGAIN MADE TRIAL OF IT BUT THEY WERE NONE OF THEM NEARLY STRONG ENOUGH TO STRING IT NEVERTHELESS
THEN SHE WENT BACK TO OLYMPUS
STAY YOUR HAND THEREFORE AND TELL YOUR FATHER OR HE WILL KILL ME IN HIS RAGE AGAINST THE SUITORS FOR HAVING WASTED HIS SUBSTANCE AND BEEN SO FOOLISHLY DISRESPECTFUL TO YOURSELF ULYSSES SMILED AT HIM AND ANSWERED
EVEN SO DID ULYSSES AND HIS MEN FALL UPON THE SUITORS AND SMITE THEM ON EVERY SIDE THEY MADE A HORRIBLE GROANING AS THEIR BRAINS WERE BEING BATTERED IN AND THE GROUND SEETHED WITH THEIR BLOOD
THAT I MEAN YOU NO SORT OF HARM AND AM ONLY ADVISING YOU TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD DO MYSELF IN YOUR PLACE I AM DEALING WITH YOU QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARDLY
ALONG WITH FRAGRANT HERBS REACHING THENCE SHE TOOK DOWN THE BOW WITH ITS BOW CASE FROM THE PEG ON WHICH IT HUNG SHE SAT DOWN WITH IT ON HER KNEES WEEPING BITTERLY AS SHE TOOK THE BOW OUT OF ITS CASE
I DO NOT SEE HOW I CAN DO ANY BETTER THAN THIS WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS NEPTUNE SENT A TERRIBLE GREAT WAVE THAT SEEMED TO REAR ITSELF ABOVE HIS HEAD TILL IT BROKE RIGHT OVER THE RAFT
SON OF DAMASTOR EURYNOMUS AMPHIMEDON DEMOPTOLEMUS PISANDER AND POLYBUS SON OF POLYCTOR BORE THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHT UPON THE SUITORS SIDE
BEARING A CHEST THAT CONTAINED MUCH IRON AND BRONZE WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD WON AS PRIZES WHEN SHE REACHED THE SUITORS SHE STOOD BY ONE OF THE BEARING POSTS SUPPORTING THE ROOF OF THE CLOISTER
THE PRECIPICES AND THE GOODLY TREES APPEARED ALL CHANGED AS HE STARTED UP AND LOOKED UPON HIS NATIVE LAND SO HE SMOTE HIS THIGHS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HANDS AND CRIED ALOUD DESPAIRINGLY ALAS
BREEDS MANY SUCH AND I KNOW THAT NEPTUNE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS A WAVE CAUGHT HIM AND TOOK HIM WITH SUCH FORCE
I APPEAL MORE ESPECIALLY TO EURYMACHUS AND TO ANTINOUS WHO HAS JUST SPOKEN WITH SO MUCH REASON CEASE SHOOTING FOR THE PRESENT AND LEAVE THE MATTER TO THE GODS BUT IN THE MORNING
BOUNDED FORWARD ON HER WAY AS A FOUR IN HAND CHARIOT FLIES OVER THE COURSE WHEN THE HORSES FEEL THE WHIP HER PROW CURVETTED AS IT WERE THE NECK OF A STALLION AND A GREAT WAVE OF DARK BLUE WATER SEETHED IN HER WAKE
MY FRIENDS HE WILL SOON HAVE TO LEAVE OFF FOR MENTOR HAS GONE AWAY AFTER HAVING DONE NOTHING FOR HIM BUT BRAG THEY ARE STANDING AT THE DOORS UNSUPPORTED DO NOT AIM AT HIM ALL AT ONCE
WHAT I SAY I AFTERWARDS FIND DISCONCERTING TO RECALL I WANT TO ALTER IT I CAN FEEL MYSELF WALLOWING INTO A MESS OF MODIFICATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS YES BUT I WANT A REST ANYHOW THERE WAS NOTHING FOR DOCTOR MARTINEAU TO SAY TO THAT
A POOR DEVICE IF THAT IS ITS END IT DOESN'T KEEP PARENTS TOGETHER MORE OFTEN IT TEARS THEM APART
THERE IS A CONSCIOUSNESS OF NEW POWERS AND NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WE ARE SHARING THE ADOLESCENCE OF OUR RACE IT IS GIVING HISTORY A NEW AND MORE INTIMATE MEANING FOR US
DESPAIR LIKE THE DESPAIR OF CHILDREN THAT CAN WEEP ITSELF TO SLEEP IT'S OVER WAS IT BATTLE AND MASSACRE THAT ENDED THAT LONG AFTERNOON HERE OR DID THE WOODS CATCH FIRE SOME EXCEPTIONALLY DRY SUMMER LEAVING BLACK HILLS AND FAMINE
THIS IS A CURIOUS ENCOUNTER THAT YOUNG WOMAN HAS BRAINS SAID SIR RICHMOND STANDING BEFORE THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS NO DOUBT WHATEVER WHICH YOUNG WOMAN HE MEANT BUT DOCTOR MARTINEAU GRUNTED I DON'T LIKE THE AMERICAN TYPE THE DOCTOR PRONOUNCED JUDICIALLY I DO SIR RICHMOND COUNTERED THE DOCTOR THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT OR SO
AND PRIDE OURSELVES UPON OUR FREEDOM FROM THE SIN OF PRESUMPTION NOT QUITE THAT WELL HOW DO YOU PUT IT WE ARE AFRAID SHE SAID IT'S TOO VAST WE WANT BRIGHT LITTLE LIVES OF OUR OWN
WITH THE UNSPOKEN ADDITION OF YOU TRY HER FOR A BIT MISS GRAMMONT STOOD UP EVERYBODY STOOD UP WE CAN GO FIRST TO LOOK FOR SHOPS SHE SAID THERE'S THOSE THINGS YOU WANT TO BUY BELINDA A FOUNTAIN PEN AND THE LITTLE BOOKS
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING OF OUR OLD RIVER SEVERN WE WILL COME RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT IF WE GO THROUGH BRISTOL THERE WE SHALL HAVE A WHIFF OF AMERICA OUR NEW FIND FROM WHICH THE TOBACCO COMES
CHEAP SORT OF WAY SHE IS LIKE SOME PUSHFUL ADVERTISING TRADESMAN SHE ISN'T FRANK WITH US SHE JUST HUMBUGS US INTO WHAT SHE WANTS WITH US
SO THEY STROLLED TO AND FRO ROUND AND ABOUT THE WEST END AND ALONG THE PATH UNDER THE TREES TOWARDS THE RIVER EXCHANGING THEIR IDEAS VERY FRANKLY AND FREELY
AND WERE VERY LEARNED AND INCONCLUSIVE ABOUT THE EXACT PURPOSE OF THIS VAST HEAP OF CHALK AND EARTH THIS HEAP THAT MEN HAD MADE BEFORE THE TEMPLES AT KARNAK WERE BUILT OR BABYLON HAD A NAME THEN THEY RETURNED TO THE CAR AND RAN ROUND BY A WINDING ROAD INTO THE WONDER OF AVEBURY
LOGICAL NECESSITY AND UTTER DESOLATION WITH NOTHING WHATEVER WORTH FIGHTING FOR WHATEVER JUSTIFIES EFFORT WHATEVER RESTORES ENERGY IS HIDDEN IN WOMEN AN ACCESS OF SEX SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU
REGRETTING HIS DIMINISHING ABILITY TO SLEEP IN THE EARLY MORNING NOW EVEN WHEN HE WAS IN THE STRONG AND SOOTHING AIR OF MID ATLANTIC AND THINKING OF V V BECAUSE SHE HAD A WAY OF COMING INTO HIS MIND WHEN IT WAS UNDEFENDED
THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THOUGHT IS AWAY FROM HAPHAZARD TOWARDS CONTROL IN THINGS GENERALLY BUT IS THE MOVEMENT OF EVENTS THE ETERNAL PROBLEM OF MAN SAID SIR RICHMOND CAN OUR WILLS PREVAIL THERE CAME A LITTLE PAUSE
EITHER HE REGRETTED THE EXTENT OF HIS CONFIDENCES OR THE SLIGHT IRRATIONAL IRRITATION THAT HE FELT AT WAITING FOR HIS CAR AFFECTED HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIS COMPANION OR DOCTOR MARTINEAU'S TENTATIVES WERE ILL CHOSEN AT ANY RATE
AND THE ROMANS AGAINST THE CELTS AND THE SAXONS AGAINST THE ROMANIZED BRITONS AND THE DANES AGAINST THE SAXONS A WAR SCARRED LANDSCAPE ABOUNDING IN DYKES AND ENTRENCHMENTS AND CASTLES SUNKEN NOW INTO THE DEEPEST PEACE TO GLASTONBURY
YOU MAY GO ABOUT AND STILL PULL THROUGH BUT AT ANY TIME THIS MAY PASS INTO PNEUMONIA AND THERE'S NOT MUCH IN YOU JUST NOW TO STAND UP AGAINST PNEUMONIA I'LL TAKE ALL REASONABLE CARE
AND BIT HIS LOWER LIP AND CONSIDERED WE MIGHT DROP BELINDA HE SUGGESTED TURNING TO HIS FRIEND AND SPEAKING IN LOW CONFIDENTIAL TONES SHE IS QUITE A MANAGEABLE PERSON QUITE
MAKING THEM MATTER AS FORMERLY THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER THAT IDEA OF THE BRIGHT LITTLE PRIVATE LIFE HAS TO GO BY THE BOARD I SUPPOSE IT HAS SHE SAID MEDITATIVELY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN THINKING OVER SOME SUCH QUESTION BEFORE
THAT FAINT FLAVOUR OF THE AMERINDIAN ONE SEES AT TIMES IN AMERICAN WOMEN HER VOICE WAS A VERY SOFT AND PLEASING VOICE
AND NO ONE TO SLAP THEM OR TELL THEM NOT TO AFTER ALL THEY PROBABLY ONLY THOUGHT OF DEATH NOW AND THEN AND THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF FUEL THEY SUPPOSED THERE WAS NO END TO THAT SO THEY USED UP THEIR WOODS AND KEPT GOATS TO NIBBLE AND KILL THE NEW UNDERGROWTH DID THESE PEOPLE HAVE GOATS
TO LOOK AT MYSELF AS A CASE NOW I CAN EVEN SEE MYSELF AS A REMOTE CASE THAT I NEEDN'T BOTHER ABOUT FURTHER SO FAR AS THAT GOES I THINK WE HAVE DONE ALL THAT THERE IS TO BE DONE I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT QUITE YET SAID THE DOCTOR
THIS MASCULINIZATION IDEA HAD ALSO SENT HER ON A COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY INTO MEXICO THERE APPARENTLY SHE HAD REALLY DONE RESPONSIBLE WORK BUT UPON THE QUESTION OF LABOUR MISTER GRAMMONT WAS FIERCE
IT LOOKS SIR RICHMOND SAID AS THOUGH SOME OLD GIANTESS HAD LEFT A DISCARDED SET OF TEETH ON THE HILLSIDE FAR MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN STONEHENGE ITSELF WERE THE BARROWS THAT CAPPED THE NEIGHBOURING CRESTS THE SACRED STONES WERE FENCED ABOUT
STRAIGHT AND LOVELY DESIRABLE AND UNAPPROACHABLE ABOVE THAT SORT OF NONSENSE ABOVE ALL OTHER MASCULINE SUBJUGATION V V I'M GOING TO MAKE A MAN OF YOU HIS MIND GREW CALMER
I'VE NO DOUBT OF IT SAID MISS SEYFFERT AND ADDED AMAZINGLY I'M OUT FOR BIRTH CONTROL ALL THE TIME A BRIEF BUT ACTIVE PAUSE ENSUED
BUT COULD YOU PICK OUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ARISTOCRATS BEGAN MISS GRAMMONT MY NATIVE INSTINCTIVE DEMOCRACY NEED NOT BE OUTRAGED SAID SIR RICHMOND ANY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION WOULD DO THEY'D BE ABLE TO DEVELOP FULLY ALL OF THEM
SIR RICHMOND WOULD GO WITH MISS GRAMMONT HE HIMSELF AND MISS SEYFFERT WOULD BRING UP THE REAR IF I DO HE MUTTERED I'LL BE DAMNED AN UNUSUALLY STRONG EXPRESSION FOR HIM YOU SAID ASKED MISS SEYFFERT
THERE WERE PROBABLY SOME UNEASY CURIOSITIES A GROTESQUE DREAM OR SO PERHAPS I CAN'T RECALL ANYTHING OF THAT SORT DISTINCTLY NOW I HAD A VERY LIVELY INTEREST IN WOMEN EVEN WHEN I WAS STILL QUITE A LITTLE BOY AND A CERTAIN WHAT SHALL I CALL IT
HE SAID BEST LOVE OLD MARTIN LOVE DOCTOR MARTINEAU WAS TURNING AWAY WHEN SIR RICHMOND SPOKE AGAIN IN A WHISPER BEST LOVE
I AM AFRAID YOU ARE VERY ILL HE SAID RETURNING TO THE BEDSIDE THIS IS NOT AS YOU SAY MY SORT OF WORK WILL YOU LET ME CALL IN ANOTHER MAN
SHE WAS DRESSED IN A TIGHT BATHING DRESS AND NOT IN THE CLUMSY SKIRTS AND FRILLS THAT IT WAS THE CUSTOM TO INFLICT ON WOMEN IN THOSE DAYS HER HAIR WAS TIED UP IN A BLUE HANDKERCHIEF SHE RAN SWIFTLY AND GRACEFULLY INTENT UPON THE WHITE LINE OF FOAM AHEAD
HIS PROTECTIVE DUTY TO THEM THESE COMPANIONS THESE SEYFFERT WOMEN AND SO FORTH WERE ALL VERY WELL IN THEIR WAY THERE WASN'T MUCH THEY KEPT FROM YOU IF YOU GOT THEM CORNERED AND ASKED THEM INTENTLY
AND THEN HE WOULD DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TO A KIND OF MASCULINIZATION OF HIS DAUGHTER AND TO SCHEMES FOR GIVING HER THE COMPLETEST CONTROL OF ALL HE HAD TO LEAVE HER PROVIDED SHE NEVER MARRIED NOR FELL UNDER MASCULINE SWAY AFTER ALL
ALL VERY WELL IN THE EARLY STONE AGE WHEN THE POOR DEAR THINGS NEVER REALIZED THAT THEIR MUTUAL ENDEARMENTS MEANT ALL THE TROUBLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARENTAGE BUT NOW
THEY STOOD FOR SOME MOMENTS SURVEYING IT IT'S A PERFECT LITTLE LADY OF A CATHEDRAL SAID SIR RICHMOND BUT WHY I WONDER DID WE BUILD IT YOUR MEMORY OUGHT TO BE BETTER THAN MINE SHE SAID WITH HER HALF CLOSED EYES BLINKING UP AT THE SUNLIT SPIRE SHARP AGAINST THE BLUE
AND MISS GRAMMONT WAS COUNTERING WITH EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY QUALIFICATIONS OUR AGE WILL LEAVE THE RUINS OF HOTELS SAID SIR RICHMOND RAILWAY ARCHES AND HOTELS BATHS AND AQUEDUCTS MISS GRAMMONT COMPARED ROME OF THE EMPIRE COMES NEAREST TO IT
PROBABLY BORED HER MORE THAN SHE REALIZED TO ANYONE TOO INTELLIGENT TO BE STEADILY EXCITED BY BUYING THINGS AND WEARING THINGS AND DANCING AND PLAYING GAMES AND GOING TO PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT AND BEING GIVEN FLOWERS SWEETS JEWELLERY
SECTION TWO FOR THE BETTER PART OF FORTY HOURS SIR RICHMOND HAD EITHER BEEN TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT OR CARRYING ON IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH HER IN HER ABSENCE
THIS YOUNG LADY WHOSE CHARM AND CLEVERNESS I ADMIT BEHAVES AS IF THE NEW AGE WERE ALREADY HERE WELL THAT MAY BE A VERY DANGEROUS MISTAKE BOTH FOR HER AND FOR YOU THIS AFFAIR IF IT GOES ON FOR A FEW DAYS MORE
SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU AS A PASSING BOTANIST MIGHT RECOGNIZE AND NAME A FLOWER SIR RICHMOND STARED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT IT HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST CONNEXION WITH MY MOTHER OR ANY MOTHER OR ANY PARTICULAR WOMAN AT ALL
HER VIEWS ABOUT AMERICA AND ABOUT HER OWN PLACE IN THE WORLD SEEMED EQUALLY FRESH AND ORIGINAL TO SIR RICHMOND I REALIZE I'VE GOT TO BE A RESPONSIBLE AMERICAN CITIZEN SHE HAD SAID
THEY WERE IMPEDED AT THE ENTRANCE BY A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THE KEEPER OF THE TURNSTILE AND A SMALL BUT RESOLUTE BOY OF PERHAPS FIVE OR SIX WHO PROPOSED TO LEAVE THE ENCLOSURE
AND MY SKY SCRAPERS STILL THE FUN OF BUILDING THAT IS THE THING I ENVY MOST ABOUT AMERICA IT'S STILL LARGE ENOUGH MENTALLY AND MATERIALLY TO BUILD ALL SORTS OF THINGS OVER HERE THE SITES ARE FRIGHTFULLY CROWDED AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WE ARE BUILDING NOW
I GOT TO DEFINITE KNOWLEDGE PRETTY EARLY BY THE TIME I WAS ELEVEN OR TWELVE NORMALLY WHAT IS NORMALLY DECENTLY ANYHOW HERE AGAIN I MAY BE FORGETTING MUCH SECRET AND SHAMEFUL CURIOSITY
SUFFICIENT BEGGING FROM FOREIGNERS IS JUST A SPORT IN ITALY SAID SIR RICHMOND IT DOESN'T IMPLY WANT BUT I AGREE THAT A LARGE PART OF ITALY IS FRIGHTFULLY OVERPOPULATED THE WHOLE WORLD IS DON'T YOU THINK SO MARTINEAU WELL YES FOR ITS PRESENT SOCIAL ORGANIZATION
SAID SIR RICHMOND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE LADY ON THE ROCK RATHER THAN TO THE ANGRY PARENT BELOW HE'S PERFECTLY SAFE AND HAPPY
WELL SHE IMPRESSED ME AS HAVING THE AIR OF A GIRL WHO HAS HAD TO SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS FOR WHICH THE NORMAL MOTHER PROVIDES READY MADE SOLUTIONS THAT IS HOW I INFERRED THAT THERE WAS NO MOTHER I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN ANY STEPMOTHER
AS SOON AS TEA WAS OVER DOCTOR MARTINEAU REALIZED THEY MEANT TO WALK ROUND AND ABOUT SALISBURY HE FORESAW THAT WALK WITH THE UTMOST CLEARNESS IN FRONT AND KEEPING JUST A LITTLE BEYOND THE RANGE OF HIS INTERVENTION
ENTERTAINING A LOVER BEING POSSIBLY MOST SHAMEFUL THOUGHT IN LOVE LIKE SOME ORDINARY SILLY FEMALE SINKING TO KISSES TO THE DEEDS ONE COULD BUY AND PAY FOR HIS V V
INDEED THEY'VE FAILED ALTOGETHER TO GET HIM STONEHENGE HE SAYS IS NO GOOD SO HE'S GONE BACK TO CLEAN THE LAMPS OF YOUR CAR
AND WHAT LIKE WERE THOSE WOODEN GODS OF OURS I DON'T REMEMBER BUT I COULD EASILY PERSUADE MYSELF THAT I HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE
THE MAN AT THE TURNSTILE MUTELY CONSULTED THE DOCTOR
MY FIRST LOVE WAS BRITANNIA AS DEPICTED BY TENNIEL IN THE CARTOONS IN PUNCH I MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY LITTLE CHAP AT THE TIME OF THE BRITANNIA AFFAIR I JUST CLUNG TO HER IN MY IMAGINATION AND DID DEVOTED THINGS FOR HER THEN I RECALL A LITTLE LATER
AND HONOUR THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE IN MATTERS OF PROPERTY ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC CONDUCT IT WILL PROBABLY BE JUST THE REVERSE THEN THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE COLLECTIVE CONTROL AND MUCH MORE INSISTENCE LEGAL INSISTENCE UPON INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR A LONG TIME SIR RICHMOND HAD MET NO ONE SO INTERESTING AND AMUSING AS THIS FRANK MINDED YOUNG WOMAN FROM AMERICA YOUNG WOMAN WAS HOW HE THOUGHT OF HER SHE DIDN'T CORRESPOND TO ANYTHING SO PRIM AND RESTRAINED AND EXTENSIVELY RESERVED AND WITHHELD AS A YOUNG LADY
BUT ALSO IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD NOT CRYSTALLIZED OUT IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND BEFORE HIS TALKS WITH DOCTOR MARTINEAU THE IDEA OF A NEW AGE NECESSARILY CARRIES WITH IT THE IDEA OF FRESH RULES OF CONDUCT AND OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS
THEY TOOK A TURN ABOUT THE WALLS WITH THE MOON SINKING OVER BEYOND SILBURY
SAID THE DOCTOR HAS LEFT ITS TRACES IN TRADITIONS IN MENTAL PREDISPOSITIONS IN STILL UNANALYZED FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS ARCHAEOLOGY IS VERY LIKE REMEMBERING SAID SIR RICHMOND PRESENTLY WE SHALL REMEMBER A LOT MORE ABOUT ALL THIS
SHE HAD HAD NO HUSBAND OF THE LORD AND MASTER TYPE SO TO SPEAK BUT ONLY A PRINCE CONSORT WELL IN HAND WHY SHOULDN'T THE GRAMMONT HEIRESS DOMINATE HER MALE BELONGING IF IT CAME TO THAT IN THE SAME FASHION
OR DID STRANGE MEN BRING A SICKNESS MEASLES PERHAPS OR THE BLACK DEATH OR WAS IT CATTLE PEST OR DID WE JUST WASTE OUR WOODS AND DWINDLE AWAY BEFORE THE NEW PEOPLES THAT CAME INTO THE LAND ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SEA I CAN'T REMEMBER
SENSIBLE LITTLE PIGGY WIGGYS WE HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE AND HAPPINESS FIRST SAID SIR RICHMOND AS MUCH RIGHT AS A PIG HAS TO FOOD BUT WHETHER WE GET LIFE AND HAPPINESS OR FAIL TO GET THEM WE HUMAN BEINGS
I DO NOT THINK THAT I SHALL STIR UP MY MOTIVES ANY MORE FOR A TIME BETTER TO GO ON INTO THE WEST COUNTRY COOLING MY POOR OLD BRAIN IN THESE WIDE SHADOWS OF THE PAST I CAN PRESCRIBE NOTHING BETTER SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU
RESTED ON THAT FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEN HE SAID IF THERE IS ANYONE ELSE NOT POSSIBLE SAID SIR RICHMOND WITH HIS EYES ON THE CEILING
WHY DIDN'T THE GIRL CONFIDE IN HER FATHER AT LEAST ABOUT THESE THINGS WHAT WAS AFOOT SHE HAD THROWN OVER LAKE ONCE AND IT SEEMED SHE WAS GOING TO TURN HIM DOWN AGAIN WELL
AND THAT SHE HAD ALREADY READ AND THOUGHT RATHER MORE THAN MOST YOUNG WOMEN IN HER POSITION BEFORE SHE WAS TWENTY I GUESS SHE WAS ALREADY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING IN THE WAY OF MEN THAN A RICH ADMIRER WITH AN AUTOMOBILE FULL OF PRESENTS THOSE WHO SEEK FIND
BUT CONTROLLING FATHER AS DISTINGUISHED FROM MANAGING HIM SHE REVIEWED SOME PRIVATE AND AMUSING MEMORIES HE IS A MOST INTRACTABLE MAN SECTION THREE
WHERE NOTHING IS CONCEALED NOTHING CAN EXPLODE ON THE WHOLE I CAME UP TO ADOLESCENCE PRETTY STRAIGHT AND CLEAN SAID SIR RICHMOND WHAT STANDS OUT IN MY MEMORY NOW
MITIGATED ONLY BY SUCH EXERCISE AS THE GAME OF POKER AFFORDS HAD INTENSIFIED AN INSTINCTIVE INEXPRESSIVENESS UNDER THE MOST SOLITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OLD GRAMMONT WAS STILL INEXPRESSIVE
SECTION THREE I WAS NEVER WHOLEHEARTED AND SIMPLE ABOUT SEXUAL THINGS SIR RICHMOND RESUMED PRESENTLY NEVER
A NURSE APPEARED REMOTELY GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE AEROPLANE SHEDS AND HER CRY OF
I MUST CONFESS THAT FOUR PEOPLE MAKE THE CAR AT ANY RATE SEEM TREMENDOUSLY OVERPOPULATED AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I DO NOT FIND THIS ENCOUNTER SO AMUSING AS YOU SEEM TO DO I SHALL NOT BE SORRY WHEN WE HAVE WAVED GOOD BYE TO THOSE YOUNG LADIES AND RESUME OUR INTERRUPTED CONVERSATION
SIR RICHMOND SAID NOTHING IT MAY HELP YOU TO SEE THIS AFFAIR FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE IF I TELL YOU THAT TWICE TODAY MISS SEYFFERT HAS ASKED ME IF YOU WERE A MARRIED MAN AND OF COURSE YOU TOLD HER I WAS
YOU ALSO ARE A PERSON OF HIGH INTELLIGENCE AND DEFECTIVE CONTROLS SHE IS VERY MUCH AT LOOSE ENDS YOU ON ACCOUNT OF THE ILLNESS OF THAT RATHER FORGOTTEN LADY MISS MARTIN LEEDS
WHAT SHALL I CALL IT THIS DREAM OF WOMEN GREW UP IN MY MIND AS I GREW UP AS SOMETHING INDEPENDENT OF AND MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE REALITY OF WOMEN IT CAME ONLY VERY SLOWLY INTO RELATION WITH THAT
THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE AT FIRST SIR RICHMOND'S RAISED EYEBROWS CONVEYED THAT HE ACCEPTED THIS FACT I THINK LADY HARDY OUGHT TO BE SENT FOR
THE SUSTAINING TOPIC WAS THIS NEW AGE SIR RICHMOND FORE SHADOWED THIS WORLD UNDER SCIENTIFIC CONTROL THE UTOPIA OF FULLY DEVELOPED PEOPLE FULLY DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES OF THE EARTH
AFTER A SWIFT BUT COMPETENT TRAINING INTO A SHIRT WAIST AND AN OFFICE DOWN TOWN SHE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED AT FIRST TO A HARVESTER CONCERN INDEPENDENT OF MISTER GRAMMONT BECAUSE HE FEARED HIS OWN PEOPLE WOULDN'T TRAIN HER HARD
AND NO HUMAN BEING EVER HAD A SHOW YET WITHOUT TRYING TO SHUT PEOPLE OUT OF IT IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM COME IN I GUESS THIS WAS COVERED IN ALL RIGHT A DARK HUNCHED OLD PLACE IN A WOOD BEECH STEMS SMOOTH LIKE PILLARS AND THEY CAME TO IT AT NIGHT IN PROCESSION
OLD GRAMMONT AS HE APPEARED UPON THE PILLOW OF HIS BED BY THE LIGHT OF A ROSE SHADED BEDSIDE LAMP WAS A SMALL HEADED GREY HAIRED GENTLEMAN WITH A WRINKLED FACE AND SUNKEN BROWN EYES YEARS OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE
FOR A MOMENT HE HAD A WILD HOPE THAT HIS COMPANION WOULD AGREE AND THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT THE DOCTOR'S SILENCE MEANT ONLY THE PREPARATION OF AN ULTIMATUM I OBJECT TO MISS GRAMMONT AND THAT SIDE OF THE THING MORE THAN I DO TO MISS SEYFFERT
TO WHAT MAY EASILY DEVELOP AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL INTO A VERY SERIOUS FLIRTATION AN ABSURD MISCHIEVOUS IRRELEVANT FLIRTATION YOU MAY NOT LIKE THE WORD YOU MAY PRETEND IT IS A CONVERSATION AN ORDINARY INTELLECTUAL CONVERSATION THAT IS NOT THE WORD
IT WAS NOT HIS BUSINESS TO KNOW THESE VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS PRINTED THEMSELVES ON DOCTOR MARTINEAU'S MIND AFTER HIS FIRST CURSORY EXAMINATION OF HIS PATIENT AND WHILE HE CAST ABOUT FOR ANYTHING
THE WOMEN AND GIRLS ABOUT ME WERE FUSSY BUNCHES OF CLOTHES THAT I AM SURE I NEVER EVEN LINKED WITH THAT DREAM WORLD OF LOVE AND WORSHIP WERE YOU CO EDUCATED NO BUT I HAD A COUPLE OF SISTERS ONE OLDER ONE YOUNGER THAN MYSELF
SO FAR AS I KNOW THEY HAD NO BEASTS OF BURTHEN BUT SUPPOSE ONE DAY SOMEONE WERE TO FIND A POTSHERD HERE FROM EARLY KNOSSOS OR A FRAGMENT OF GLASS FROM PEPI'S EGYPT THE PLACE HAD STIRRED UP HIS IMAGINATION
THAT GIRL ON THE DYMCHURCH BEACH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST LINKS BUT SHE CEASED VERY SPEEDILY TO BE REAL
HE JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND AWAY HE SCAMPERED WITH THE COOK AT HIS HEELS WELL THE UPSHOT OF THE BUSINESS WAS THAT SIMON AGRICOLA HAD TO GO BACK AND BRING LIFE TO THE WOMAN AGAIN OR THE COOK WOULD THUMP HIM AND BABO BOTH WITH THE ROLLING PIN AND WHAT WAS MORE
AND HAD STOLEN AN IRON POT FULL OF GOLD MONEY DAY BROKE BEFORE THEY REACHED HOME SO DOWN THEY SAT TO CONSIDER THE MATTER AND THE PLACE WHERE THEY SEATED THEMSELVES WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE WHERE BABO LAY THE OLDER THIEF WAS FOR CARRYING THE MONEY HOME UNDER HIS COAT
WHAT MEANS ALL THIS SORROW SAID HE TO ONE OF THE SLAVES INSTANTLY ALL THE SLAVES BEGAN HOWLING AND BEATING THEIR HEADS AND HE TO WHOM THE YOUNG MAN HAD SPOKEN FELL DOWN WITH HIS FACE IN THE DUST
THAT MAN WOULD LEAD HIM TO THE GARDEN
THEY WILL BE OF USE BY AND BY AND AS HE SPOKE HE PICKED UP A GREAT STONE AS BIG AS HIS TWO FISTS AND DROPPED IT INTO THE POUCH THAT DANGLED AT HIS SIDE NOT I SAID BABO I WILL CARRY NO STONE WITH ME
UP STEPPED THE WISE MAN TO THE GALLOWS AND GAVE IT A SHARP RAP WITH HIS STAFF THEN LO AND BEHOLD THE GALLOWS WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A FINE INN WITH LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS
OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN A KING IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ILL LUCK AND THAT IS THE WAY WE ALL OF US TALK DOCTOR FAUSTUS HAD SAT ALL THE WHILE NEITHER DRINKING ALE NOR SMOKING TOBACCO BUT WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND IN SILENCE
OH FOOL FOOL
SAID SIMON AGRICOLA THEN LISTEN TO MORROW I AM GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD TO MAKE MY FORTUNE FOR LITTLE OR NOTHING IS TO BE HAD IN THIS TOWN IF YOU WILL GO ALONG WITH ME I WILL MAKE YOUR FORTUNE ALSO
LEADING THE WAY THEY BROUGHT THE TWO THROUGH HALLS AND CHAMBERS AND ROOM AFTER ROOM EACH MORE MAGNIFICENT THAN THE OTHER UNTIL THEY CAME TO ONE THAT SURPASSED A HUNDREDFOLD ANY OF THE OTHERS
NO ONE SINCE THAT TIME HAS BEEN PERMITTED TO ENTER THE PALACE IT IS FORBIDDEN FOR ANY ONE EVEN TO ASK A QUESTION CONCERNING IT BUT EVERY YEAR ON THE DAY ON WHICH THE QUEEN WAS TURNED TO STONE THE WHOLE LAND MOURNS WITH WEEPING AND WAILING
HAD PAID HIM THE GOLDEN ANGEL HE HAD PROMISED FOR THE USE OF THE FORGE THE DOCTOR PULLED A SOUR FACE BUT ALL THE SAME HE HAD TO PAY THE ANGEL THEN THE SMITH LET HIM GO AND OFF HE MARCHED IN A HUFF
FOR I CANNOT OPEN IT FOR MYSELF AS THERE IS NEITHER LOCK NOR KEY TO IT THAT ALSO I AM FORBIDDEN TO DO SAID ZADOK I WISH THAT I KNEW WHAT WAS THERE SAID THE YOUNG MAN THE DEMON LAUGHED
I CANNOT SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE TRUTH BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN SPOILED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER FOR I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYBODY IN THESE DAYS WHO WOULD GIVE EVEN SO MUCH AS A BAD PENNY FOR IT AND YET IT IS WORTH JUST AS MUCH NOW AS IT WAS WHEN BABO SOLD IT TO THE KING
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO LOOK THERE WAS NO KEY HOLE TO IT
THY FATHER WHO WAS THE WISEST AND MOST CUNNING MAGICIAN IN THE WORLD TURNED HER INTO STONE
AND TWO GREAT WINGS GREW OUT OF HIS SHOULDERS FOR HE FLIES FAST AND COMES QUICKLY TO THOSE WHOM HE VISITS DOES ILL LUCK
THUS SHOULD THE HEADS OF ALL THE LIKE BE CHOPPED OFF FROM THEIR SHOULDERS IS THERE NOT SOME ONE HERE TO TELL US A FAIR STORY ABOUT A SAINT FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SAID THE LAD WHO FIDDLED WHEN THE JEW WAS IN THE BRAMBLE BUSH
WIGHT HUNG DANCING UPON NOTHING AT ALL AND THERE NIGHT CAUGHT THEM AGAIN AHA SAID BABO TO HIMSELF THIS TIME I SHALL HAVE BREAD AND MY MASTER NONE BUT LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED
SEE HERE IS A LITTLE PEBBLE AND ITS LIKE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS FOR WHOEVER HOLDS IT IN HIS MOUTH CAN HEAR WHILE HE DOES SO
NOW THERE WAS A VERY VERY RICH MAN IN THAT TOWN WHOSE DAUGHTER LAY SICK TO DEATH AND WHEN THE NEWS OF THIS GREAT DOCTOR WAS BROUGHT TO HIS EARS HE WAS FOR HAVING HIM TRY HIS HAND AT CURING THE GIRL VERY WELL SAID SIMON AGRICOLA
WITH HIS SERVANTS AT HIS HEELS AND THAT WAS ALL THE GOOD THAT SIMON AGRICOLA HAD OF THIS TRICK BUT ILL LUCK WAS NOT DONE WITH HIM YET FOR WHEN THE SMITH SAW HOW MATTERS HAD TURNED OUT
AND SHALL SIT ON A THRONE BESIDE ME YOU CAN GUESS WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS MUSIC TO THE FIDDLER'S EARS SO THE PRINCES WERE SENT PACKING AND THE FIDDLER WAS MARRIED TO THE QUEEN AND REIGNED IN THAT COUNTRY WELL THREE OR FOUR DAYS PASSED
NOW HOW MUCH WILL YOU SELL YOUR ADVICE TO ME FOR HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE SAID BABO WELL SAID THE KING LET ME HAVE IT FOR A DAY ON TRIAL AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME I WILL PAY YOU WHAT IT IS WORTH VERY WELL SAID BABO
NOR HAD HE ANY FEAR OF AN END COMING TO IT FOR HE KNEW THAT HIS TREASURE WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE HE MADE FRIENDS WITH THE PRINCES AND NOBLES OF THE LAND FROM FAR AND WIDE PEOPLE CAME TO VISIT HIM
AND SO YOU SHALL LIVE WITH ME AS LONG AS I LIVE AND AFTER I AM GONE EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE SHALL BE YOURS THE FIDDLER DID NOTHING BUT STARE WITH OPEN EYES AND MOUTH AS THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER SHUT EITHER AGAIN
STRANGE FIGURES MARKING IT WITH HIS FINGER UPON THE GROUND THEN OUT FROM UNDER HIS RED GOWN HE BROUGHT A TINDER BOX AND STEEL AND A LITTLE SILVER CASKET COVERED ALL OVER WITH STRANGE FIGURES OF SERPENTS AND DRAGONS AND WHAT NOT
AS FOR THE WISE MAN HE FINISHED HIS LOAF OF BREAD TO THE LAST CRUMB
BUT THE FISHERMAN'S WIFE HAD LISTENED TO WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID ABOUT PAYING FOR THE JOB AND SHE WAS OF A DIFFERENT MIND FROM HER HUSBAND COME SAID SHE THE OLD MAN PROMISES TO PAY YOU WELL THIS IS NOT A CHANCE TO BE LOST I CAN TELL YOU
EVEN IF IT BE THROUGH A KEY HOLE NOW IS THAT SO YES SAYS ILL LUCK IT IS WELL LOOK NOW FRIEND SAYS SAINT NICHOLAS
TELL ME SAID ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL WHY ARE YOU ALL SO SORROWFUL INSTANTLY THEY WHO STOOD WAITING BEGAN CRYING AND TEARING THEIR CLOTHES AND BEATING THEIR HANDS AS FOR THE CHAMBERLAIN HE WAS A REVEREND OLD MAN
BABO GATHERED RUSHES FOR A CHAIR MAKER AND HE ALSO HAD TOO FEW OF THE GOOD THINGS TO MAKE LIFE EASY BUT IT IS NOTHING OUT OF THE WAY FOR A SIMPLETON TO BE IN THAT CASE THE TWO OF THEM LIVED NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR THE ONE IN THE NEXT HOUSE TO THE OTHER
FOR THY DOOM IS NEAR DO NOT PUSH THE DOOR OPEN FOR IT IS NOT LOCKED THE YOUNG MAN STRUCK HIS HEAD WITH HIS CLINCHED FIST WHAT A FOOL AM I HE CRIED WILL I NEVER LEARN WISDOM
AND OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT AGAIN IT TOOK HIM MAYBE AN HOUR TO COUNT ALL THE MONEY AND JEWELS HE HAD BROUGHT UP WITH HIM AFTER HE HAD DONE THAT HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS INSIDE OF THE LITTLE DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM FIRST HE WONDERED
EACH HELD A FLAMING TORCH OF SANDAL WOOD BEHIND THE SLAVES STOOD A DOUBLE ROW OF ARMED MEN AND BEHIND THEM A GREAT CROWD OF OTHER SLAVES AND ATTENDANTS DRESSED EACH AS MAGNIFICENTLY AS A PRINCE BLAZING AND FLAMING
AND MY SON HIMSELF SHALL GO WITH YOU TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THAT IS GOOD SAID THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND IF HE WILL DO SO I WILL PAY HIM WELL FOR HIS TROUBLE SO THE YOUNG MAN PUT ON HIS HAT AND TOOK UP HIS STICK
HOW SHALL I PAY YOU SAID SIMON AGRICOLA I HAVE NOT A SINGLE GROAT IN THE WORLD WHAT SAID BABO HAVE YOU NOTHING TO GIVE ME I CAN GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE WELL SAID BABO
DOWN THEY DROPPED THE POT OF MONEY AND AWAY THEY SCAMPERED AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM BABO HEARD THEM RUNNING AND POKED HIS HEAD THROUGH THE HEDGE AND THERE LAY THE POT OF GOLD LOOK NOW SAID HE THIS HAS COME FROM THE ADVICE THAT WAS GIVEN ME
THERE HE STOOD ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE WAVES BEATING AND DASHING ON THE ROCKS HE STOOD LOOKING AND WONDERING TO FIND HIMSELF IN SUCH A PLACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING CAME WITH A WHIZ AND A RUSH AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT AND AWAY HE FLEW LIKE A BULLET
WILT THOU NOT LET ME PAY FOR HAVING IT FILLED THAT SAID THE LAD WHO FIDDLED WHEN THE JEW WAS IN THE BRAMBLE BUSH MAY BE AS YOU PLEASE SIR KNIGHT AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I WILL BE MIGHTILY GLAD FOR A DROP TO MOISTEN MY THROAT WITHAL
OR LEAVE ME FOREVER THEY HAD BOTH FORGOTTEN THAT THE DEMON ZADOK WAS THERE THEN THE YOUNG MAN BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF THE TALISMAN OF SOLOMON TELL ME O TALISMAN SAID HE HOW SHALL I OPEN YONDER DOOR OH WRETCHED ONE
BUT BABO HAD KEPT HIS EYES OPEN SIMON AGRICOLA HAD LAID DOWN THE VIAL UPON THE TABLE AND WHILE THEY WERE SAYING THIS AND THAT BACK AND FORTH THINKING OF NOTHING ELSE BABO QUIETLY SLIPPED IT INTO HIS OWN POCKET WITHOUT ANY ONE BUT HIMSELF BEING THE WISER
INSTANTLY GOATS OLD MAN AND ALL WERE GONE LIKE A FLASH DOWN FELL THE FISHERMAN THROUGH THE EMPTY SKY WHIRLING OVER AND OVER AND AROUND AND AROUND LIKE A FROG HE HELD TIGHTLY TO HIS NET BUT AWAY FLEW HIS FUR CAP
THE YOUNGER WAS FOR BURYING IT UNTIL NIGHT HAD COME AGAIN THEY SQUABBLED AND BICKERED AND ARGUED TILL THE NOISE THEY MADE WAKENED BABO AND HE SAT UP THE FIRST THING HE THOUGHT OF WAS THE ADVICE THAT THE DOCTOR HAD GIVEN HIM THE EVENING BEFORE THINK WELL HE BAWLED OUT
AND COVERED WITH SHELLS AND GREEN MOSS THAT WAS THE VERY THING THAT THE MAGICIAN HAD COME TO FISH FOR FROM HIS POUCH THE OLD MAN TOOK A LITTLE GOLDEN KEY WHICH HE FITTED INTO A KEY HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE CHEST
IF THE WONDERFUL PALACE HAD GROWN LIKE A BUBBLE LIKE A BUBBLE IT VANISHED THERE THE TWO STOOD ON THE SEA SHORE WITH NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT ROCKS AND SAND AND WATER AND THE STARRY SKY OVERHEAD
THE NOBLEMAN STRUTTED UP AND DOWN FOR A WHILE ADMIRING HIMSELF AND THEN HE GOT UPON HIS HORSE AGAIN BUT WAIT SAID SIMON AGRICOLA YOU FORGOT TO PAY ME MY THOUSAND GOLDEN ANGELS POOH SAID THE NOBLEMAN AND OFF HE CLATTERED
THREE OF THEM WERE STATUES OF THE KINGS AND THREE OF THEM WERE STATUES OF THE QUEENS WHO HAD GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THIS VAST AND MEASURELESS WEALTH OF ANCIENT EGYPT
AYE AYE SAID HE THE LUCK IS WITH YOU FOR SURE AND CERTAIN BUT IF YOU WILL PAY ME A THOUSAND GOLDEN ANGELS I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING BETTER THAN A PIECE OF ADVICE I WILL TEACH YOU ALL THE MAGIC THAT IS TO BE LEARNED FROM THE BOOKS NO SAID BABO
BUT SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WENT WRONG HIS WIFE AND HE FELL OUT AND QUARRELLED UNTIL THERE WAS NO LIVING TOGETHER AND SHE HAD TO GO BACK TO HER OLD HOME THEN HIS COMPANIONS DESERTED HIM AND NOW HE LIVED ALL ALONE YOURS IS A HARD CASE SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION
I WOULD AS LIEF AS NOT I LIKED THE STORY WELL ENOUGH PIPED UP THE LITTLE TAILOR WHO HAD KILLED SEVEN FLIES AT A BLOW TWAS A GOOD ENOUGH STORY OF ITS SORT BUT WHY DOES NOBODY TELL A TALE OF GOOD BIG GIANTS AND OF WILD BOARS AND OF UNICORNS
AND NO SOONER HAD ILL LUCK ENTERED THE NUT THAN HE STUCK THE PLUG IN THE HOLE AND THERE WAS MAN'S ENEMY
BE SILENT SAID THE YOUNG MAN SIX TIMES VILE THING YOU WOULD HAVE BETRAYED ME SIX TIMES YOU WOULD HAVE DEPRIVED ME OF JOYS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MINE AND EACH WAS GREATER THAN THAT WHICH WENT BEFORE
COULD HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE AND EACH WAS CLAD IN A GARMENT OF SILK AS WHITE AS SNOW EMBROIDERED WITH THREADS OF SILVER AND STUDDED WITH GLISTENING DIAMONDS BUT EACH SAT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS
TELL ME BELOVED SAID THE QUEEN UPON THE MORNING OF THE SEVENTH DAY
AND AWAY HE WENT AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM ON AND ON HE TRAVELLED UNTIL HE CAME TO THE CROSS ROADS AND THE STONE CROSS OF WHICH THE RAVEN SPOKE AND THERE SURE ENOUGH SAT THE TRAVELLER
WHEN THE QUEEN SAW THE HUGE BASIN FULL OF SILVER TREASURE HER CHEEKS AND HER FOREHEAD FLUSHED AS RED AS FIRE THEY WENT INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND WHEN THE QUEEN SAW THE BASIN OF GOLD HER FACE TURNED AS WHITE AS ASHES
CALLED THE WISE ALL THIS HAPPINESS THIS ECSTASY THAT IS NOW MINE
AND SHE WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES FIT FOR A QUEEN TO WEAR SHINING WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES THE SERVANT STOOD AND STARED LIKE ONE BEREFT OF WITS
AND THE GOLD WAS LIKE THAT HE HAD FOUND IN THE GARDEN WHEN THE YOUNG MAN SAW THIS VAST AND AMAZING WEALTH HE STOOD SPEECHLESS AND BREATHLESS WITH WONDER THE DEMON ZADOK LAUGHED THIS SAID HE IS GREAT BUT IT IS LITTLE
SHE CAME HALF WAY DOWN THE STEPS OF THE THRONE TO WELCOME THE MAGICIAN AND WHEN THE TWO MET THEY KISSED ONE ANOTHER BEFORE ALL THOSE WHO WERE LOOKING ON THEN SHE BROUGHT HIM TO THE THRONE AND SEATED HIM BESIDE HER AND THERE THEY TALKED FOR A LONG TIME VERY EARNESTLY
BY AND BY HE MANAGED TO SCREW HIS HEAD AROUND AND LOOK UP AND THERE IT WAS ILL LUCK THAT HAD HIM I THOUGHT SO SAID THE FIDDLER AND THEN HE GAVE OVER KICKING WELL ON AND ON THEY FLEW OVER HILL AND VALLEY OVER MOOR AND MOUNTAIN
AND THERE STOOD ZADOK AS BLACK AS INK AND WITH EYES THAT SHONE LIKE FIRE TELL ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN I COMMAND THEE TO TELL ME O ZADOK WHY ARE THE PEOPLE ALL GONE MAD THIS MORNING AND WHY DO THEY WEEP AND WAIL
TELL ME WHAT IS THERE THAT LIES BEYOND THAT DOOR THAT I AM FORBIDDEN TO TELL THEE O MASTER SAID THE KING OF THE DEMONS OF THE EARTH THEN OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO CHEAP AS ADVICE WHOEVER HEARD OF ANYBODY GIVING A POT OF GOLD AND SILVER MONEY FOR IT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD THEY MARCHED BABO AND HIS POT OF MONEY OFF TO THE KING COME SAID THE KING TELL ME TRULY WHERE DID YOU GET THE POT OF MONEY
TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC WELL HE PLAYED AND PLAYED UNTIL BY AND BY THE DOOR OPENED AND OUT CAME A SERVING MAN HO PIPER SAID HE
IT WAS HERE THAT I SAW THY FATHER SEAL IT SO THAT NO ONE BUT THE MASTER OF ZADOK MAY ENTER THOU MAYST GO IN ANY TIME IT MAY PLEASE THEE FOR IT IS THINE I WOULD ENTER INTO IT NOW SAID ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL
AND WISH AND WHATEVER ONE ASKS FOR ONE SHALL HAVE YOU MAY GUESS THAT WHEN THE SERVANT UNDERSTOOD THE TALK OF THE RAVENS HE WAS NOT SLOW IN MAKING USE OF WHAT HE HEARD UP HE SCRAMBLED
AND WITHOUT WIFE OR CHILD AND THIS MORNING I SAID TO MYSELF THAT THE FIRST BODY THAT CAME TO MY HOUSE I WOULD TAKE FOR A SON OR A DAUGHTER AS THE CASE MIGHT BE YOU ARE THE FIRST
FOR THERE STOOD A GIGANTIC BLACK DEMON WITH A NAPKIN WRAPPED AROUND HIS LOINS AND A SCIMITAR IN HIS RIGHT HAND THE BLADE OF WHICH GLEAMED LIKE LIGHTNING IN THE FLAME OF THE LAMP BEFORE HIM LAY A BASKET FILLED WITH SAWDUST
A PALACE OF MARBLE AND GOLD AND CARMINE AND ULTRAMARINE RISING INTO THE PURPLE STARRY SKY AND SHINING IN THE MOONLIGHT LIKE A VISION OF PARADISE THE PALACE WAS ILLUMINATED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
BY AND BY IN CAME THE GANG OF THIEVES WITH A GREAT NOISE AND UPROAR AND DOWN THEY SAT TO THEIR SUPPER
THE GOLDEN MONEY FALLING IN A SHOWER LIKE SPARKS OF YELLOW LIGHT DOWN HE FELL AND DOWN HE FELL UNTIL HIS HEAD SPUN LIKE A TOP BY GOOD LUCK HIS HOUSE WAS JUST BELOW WITH ITS THATCH OF SOFT RUSHES INTO THE VERY MIDDLE OF IT HE TUMBLED
HER FACE TURNED AS BLUE AS LEAD AND HER EYES SHONE GREEN LIKE A SNAKE'S ARE YOU CONTENT ASKED THE YOUNG MAN THE QUEEN LOOKED ABOUT HER
WHENCE COMES ALL THE WEALTH THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME THE KING HAS COMMANDED ME TO TELL HIM
AND NOW THOU KNOWEST ALL WHAT YOU TELL ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN PASSES WONDER BUT TELL ME FURTHER O ZADOK
AND FELL TO WITH KNIFE AND FORK AT THE GOOD THINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HAD A BITE TO EAT FOR A WEEK OF SUNDAYS I AM THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD SAYS THE LITTLE OLD MAN AFTER A WHILE I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAYS THE FIDDLER YOU MAY WELL BE SAID THE OLD MAN
NO OFFENCE SAID THE BLACKSMITH I MEANT NOT TO SPEAK ILL OF YOUR STORY COME COME SIR WILL YOU NOT TAKE A POT OF ALE WITH ME WHY SAID SAINT GEORGE SOMEWHAT MOLLIFIED
IT WAS ONE GOLDEN ANGEL LOOK FRIEND SAID HE TO THE BLACKSMITH IF YOU WILL LET ME HAVE YOUR FORGE FOR ONE HOUR I WILL GIVE YOU THIS MONEY FOR THE USE OF IT THE BLACKSMITH LIKED THE TUNE OF THAT SONG VERY WELL
DEAR DEAR BUT I AM HUNGRY SAID BABO SO AM I SAID SIMON AGRICOLA LET'S SIT DOWN HERE AND EAT SO DOWN THEY SAT AND SIMON AGRICOLA OPENED HIS POUCH AND DREW FORTH THE STONE THE STONE IT
IT OPENED SWIFTLY AND SILENTLY AND THEY ENTERED WITHIN WAS A NARROW ROOM AS RED AS BLOOD A FLAMING LAMP HUNG FROM THE CEILING ABOVE THE YOUNG MAN STOOD AS THOUGH TURNED TO STONE
THIS SAID HE IS NOTHING COME WITH ME HE LED HIM FROM THIS ROOM TO ANOTHER
AND WHEREON WERE ENGRAVED THESE WORDS BEHOLD BEYOND THIS DOOR IS THAT ALONE WHICH SHALL SATISFY ALL THY DESIRES NO CRIED SHE WHAT IS IT THAT LIES BEHIND YON DOOR
LISTEN O MASTER THY FATHER POSSESSED A WAND HALF OF SILVER AND HALF OF GOLD WHATSOEVER HE TOUCHED WITH SILVER BECAME CONVERTED TO STONE
WHO WAS AS BIG AS A GIANT AND SIX TIMES AS POWERFUL AND BESIDES THAT HE ADDED
ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO STAND AND LOOK
IT IS SAID THE BEAUTIFUL LADY THEN GOD BLESS YOUR PRETTY EYES SAID THE FISHERMAN THEN THE MAGICIAN KISSED THE BEAUTIFUL LADY AND BECKONING TO THE FISHERMAN LEFT THE THRONE ROOM THE SAME WAY THAT THEY HAD COME
UNTIL THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GARDEN AND THERE ILL LUCK LET THE FIDDLER DROP SWASH DOWN HE FELL INTO THE TOP OF AN APPLE TREE AND THERE HE HUNG IN THE BRANCHES IT WAS THE GARDEN OF A ROYAL CASTLE
I WANT NO MORE OF YOU HERE ARE TWO ROADS YOU TAKE ONE AND I WILL TAKE THE OTHER WHAT SAID BABO
THE WINDOWS BRIGHT WITH THE LIGHTS OF A THOUSAND WAX TAPERS AND THE SOUND OF MUSIC AND VOICES AND LAUGHTER COMING FROM WITHIN HARDLY COULD THE FISHERMAN CATCH HIS BREATH FROM ONE STRANGE THING WHEN ANOTHER HAPPENED
A DREAM MISS SCOTT HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT YES I KNEW THAT IT WOULD SOUND FOOLISH TO YOU IT SOUNDS FOOLISH TO ME BUT LISTEN SIR
UNKNOWN YESTERDAY UNKNOWN AN HOUR AGO BUT NOW HAD THERE EVER BEEN A DAY AN HOUR WHEN SHE HAD NOT BEEN AS THE VERY THROB OF HIS HEART THE LIGHT OF HIS EYES
I SEE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND MY ERRAND HERE HE PROCEEDED WITH A GRAVE SMILE MEANT AS SHE KNEW FOR HER ENCOURAGEMENT I AM GLAD BECAUSE WE CAN GO AT ONCE TO THE POINT
ORLANDO BROTHERSON DESPAIR WHILE HIS GREAT WORK LAY UNFINISHED THAT WOULD BE TO LAY STRESS ON THE INEVITABLE PAINS AND FEARS OF COMMONPLACE HUMANITY HE WAS NOT OF THAT ILK
SHOULD IT EVER BE SHOWN THAT THEY HAD MET AND KNOWN EACH OTHER AND THIS WAS NOT AN IMPOSSIBILITY OSWALD HAD BEEN EAST
DOES HE UNDERSTAND HIS OWN TROUBLE HE DOES NOT SEEM TO FOR WHEN HIS HAT THROWN ASIDE HE STOPS ERECT AND FROWNING UNDER THE FLARING GAS JET HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF LIGHTING
YOU MUST NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON YOUR DREAM HER EYES FLASHED TO HIS AND THEN FELL AGAIN DREAMS ARE NOT REVELATIONS
SUGGESTED THE LATTER AS AN OPPRESSIVE SILENCE SWALLOWED UP THAT ICY SENTENCE I HAVE ALREADY RECORDED I HAVE RETURNED MISTER CHALLONER REGAINING HIS COURAGE UNDER THE EXIGENCIES OF THE MOMENT
WENT DOWN IN INDISTINGUISHABLE CHAOS MISTER CHALLONER REALISED A SENSE OF HAVOC THOUGH THE EYES BENT UPON HIS COUNTENANCE HAD NOT WAVERED
NO HIS BRAIN WAS TOO FULL HIS PURPOSES TOO IMPORTANT FOR ANY UNNECESSARY STRAIN TO BE PUT UPON HIS FACULTIES NO THINKING INVESTIGATION FIRST
THERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION POSSIBLE FOR THIS ACT OSWALD BITTER AS IT IS FOR ME TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT I AM THUS FAR GUILTY OF THIS BELOVED WOMAN'S DEATH BUT
AND THEN THIS A YOUNG AND IMAGINATIVE GIRL'S DREAM CONVINCING TO HERSELF BUT SUPPLYING NOTHING WHICH HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN SUPPLIED BOTH BY THE FACTS AND HIS OWN IMAGINATION
AND HIS PRESENCE IN ANY COMPANY ALWAYS ATTRACTED ATTENTION AND ROUSED IF IT NEVER SATISFIED CURIOSITY CONVERSATION ACCORDINGLY CEASED AS HE STRODE UP TO MISTER CHALLONER'S SIDE
I WILL MAKE HIM SEE THAT I BOTH UNDERSTAND AND SHALL INSIST UPON MY RIGHTS IN THIS MATTER BUT YOU MAY TELL MISS DORIS THAT I WILL SIT OUT OF SIGHT AND THAT I SHALL NOT OBTRUDE MYSELF
BUT NOW AND HERE THE OTHER DEMON SPRANG ERECT AND GRAPPLED WITH HIM BEFORE THE FIRST ONE HAD LET GO HIS HOLD OSWALD AND CHALLONER THE SECRET
WILL THAT BE TOO EARLY NO NO OH HOW THOSE PEOPLE STARED LET US HASTEN BACK OR THEY MAY CONNECT YOUR NAME WITH WHAT WE WANT KEPT SECRET HE SMILED AT HER FEARS BUT GAVE IN TO HER HUMOUR
IF THIS BROTHER OF YOURS SHOULD PROVE TO BE THE MAN I AM LED TO EXPECT I SHALL ASK HIM TO TAKE THAT PLACE IN MY HEART AND LIFE WHICH WAS ONCE HERS A QUICK RECOIL A SMOTHERED EXCLAMATION ON THE PART OF THE MAN HE ADDRESSED
HE IS NOT AS UNHAPPY AS WE HE KNOWS NOTHING OF THE AFFLICTION WHICH HAS BEFALLEN HIM HE WAS TAKEN ILL THE REST WAS ALMOST INAUDIBLE
YOU HAVE DESCRIBED THE SPOT AND SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY DAUGHTER'S DEATH AS ACCURATELY AS IF YOU HAD BEEN THERE BUT YOU HAVE DOUBTLESS READ A FULL ACCOUNT OF THOSE DETAILS IN THE PAPERS
BUT IT WAS ON AGAIN WHEN IN A LITTLE WHILE HE PASSED THROUGH THE SITTING ROOM ON HIS WAY UPSTAIRS NO OTHER DAY IN HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN LIKE THIS TO THE HARDY INVENTOR
THIS WAS NOT EVEN THE LOVE HE HAD GIVEN TO EDITH CHALLONER THIS WAS SOMETHING SPRINGING FULL BORN OUT OF NOTHING A FORCE WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE MADE HIM COMPLAISANT TO THE NATURAL WEAKNESSES OF MAN
OSWALD THE TONE WAS CONTROLLING AND YET THAT OF ONE STRONG MAN TO ANOTHER IS IT FOR US TO READ THE HEART OF ANY WOMAN LEAST OF ALL OF A WOMAN OF HER SUSCEPTIBILITIES AND KEEN INNER LIFE
SHE SEEMED TO BE QUITE READY FOR THIS ANXIETY ABOUT HER PATIENT HAD REGAINED ITS PLACE IN HER MIND AND HER GLANCE SPED CONSTANTLY TOWARD THE DOOR TAKING HER HAND IN HIS HE SAID SOME KIND WORDS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WILL THINK OF ME SHE VENTURED AT LAST MOTIONING TO A CHAIR BUT NOT SITTING HERSELF YOU HAVE HAD TIME TO THINK OVER WHAT I SAID AND PROBABLY EXPECT SOMETHING REAL
SAID SHE WHY BECAUSE I'VE READ IN THE PAPERS THAT THE MAN WHO STOOD THERE HAD THE SAME NAME AS TELL ME MISS SCOTT AS MISTER BROTHERSON'S BROTHER
BUT ON CASTING HIS GLANCES ELSEWHERE HE WAS RELIEVED TO SEE HIM STANDING IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS OVERLOOKING THE STREET HIS BACK WAS TO THE ROOM AND HE SEEMED TO BE LOST IN A FIT OF ABSTRACTION AS ORLANDO CROSSED TO HIM
HAD HE FOUND THE CONNECTING LINK HAD IT BEEN COULD IT HAVE BEEN EDITH THE PREPOSTEROUS IS SOMETIMES TRUE COULD IT BE TRUE IN THIS CASE
SHE SLIPPED SOFTLY OUT AND INTERCEPTED HIM BEFORE HE HAD STEPPED UPON THE PORCH SHE HAD CAUGHT UP HER HAT AS SHE PASSED THROUGH THE HALL AND WAS FITTING IT TO HER HEAD AS HE LOOKED UP AND SAW HER MISS SCOTT HE ASKED
HE ABRUPTLY EXCLAIMED SPEAK I AM BOUND TO LISTEN YOU ARE MY BROTHER ORLANDO TURNED TOWARDS DORIS SHE WAS SLIPPING AWAY
IT WAS A SIGHT NO MAN COULD SEE UNMOVED MISTER CHALLONER TURNED SHARPLY AWAY IN DREAD OF THE ABYSS WHICH THE NEXT WORD HE UTTERED MIGHT OPEN BETWEEN THEM BUT ORLANDO BROTHERSON POSSESSED RESOURCES OF STRENGTH
WAS MISTER CHALLONER'S IMMEDIATE INQUIRY THIS I MAKE NO APOLOGIES AND EXPECT IN ANSWER NOTHING MORE THAN AN UNEQUIVOCAL YES OR NO YOU TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE NEVER MET MY BROTHER CAN THAT BE SAID
IT SURELY CANNOT BE NECESSARY FOR ME TO SAY THAT YOUR PRESENCE WILL ADD INFINITELY TO THE DIFFICULTY OF HER TASK YET IT IS A DUTY I CANNOT SHIRK I WILL CONSULT THE DOCTOR ABOUT IT
I HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE AGREEABLE TO HIM I HOPE THAT I AM NOT PRESUMING TOO MUCH IN CHERISHING THESE EXPECTATIONS DORIS TURNED HER CANDID EYES UPON HIM I CANNOT TELL I DO NOT KNOW
WORDS SO FULL OF MUSIC WHEN THEY REFERRED TO HIS BROTHER SO HARD AND COLD WHEN SHE SIMPLY ADDRESSED HIMSELF THIS WAS NO PASSING ADMIRATION OF YOUTH FOR A CAPTIVATING WOMAN
I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT YOUR OPINION THOUGH GIVEN SOMEWHAT COLDLY COINCIDES WITH THAT OF HIS FRIENDS I AM NOT GIVEN TO EXAGGERATION WAS THE EVEN REPLY
I CAN PROVE THAT YOUR DREAM IS SUCH HOW SHE LOOKED STARTLED YOU SPEAK OF SEEING SOMETHING BEING LEVELED AT YOU WHICH MADE YOU THINK OF A PISTOL YES I WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO IT
AND SOAR INTO THE HEAVEN OF FAME SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH HIS FLIGHT INTO THE OPEN HE COULD WAIT FOR THAT HOUR HE HAD MEASURED THE GULF BEFORE HIM AND FOUND IT PASSABLE HENCEFORTH
LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO TELL AND THEN YOU CAN JUDGE I WAS VERY MUCH AGITATED YESTERDAY I HAD TO WRITE A LETTER AT MISTER BROTHERSON'S DICTATION A LETTER TO HER YOU CAN UNDERSTAND MY HORROR
HE WOULD SEE HER SOON AGAIN AND POSSIBLY LEARN SOMETHING WHICH WOULD AMPLY REPAY HIM BOTH FOR HIS TROUBLE AND HIS PATIENCE BUT WHEN EVENING CAME AND SHE TURNED TO FACE HIM IN THAT LITTLE SITTING ROOM WHERE HE HAD QUIETLY FOLLOWED HER
LESS BITTER AND LESS ABRUPT THAN THOSE WHICH SPRANG INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS LIPS BUT HE DID NOT FIND THEM THOUGH HE PITIED HIS BROTHER AND WISHED TO SHOW THAT HE DID
MISS SCOTT HE CONTINUED IN A VOICE FROM WHICH HE NO LONGER STROVE TO KEEP BACK THE EVIDENCES OF DEEP FEELING I HAVE THE STRONGEST INTEREST IN YOUR PATIENT THAT ONE MAN CAN HAVE IN ANOTHER WHERE THERE IS NO PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCESHIP
SHE HAD THE GREATEST DESIRE TO SEE THE FACE OF THE MAN WHO COULD SPEAK LIKE THIS TO DAY AND YET OF WHOSE PRIDE AND SENSE OF SUPERIORITY HIS DAUGHTER HAD STOOD IN SUCH AWE THAT SHE HAD LAID A SEAL UPON THE IMPULSES OF HER HEART
DO YOU MIND WALKING A LITTLE WAY UP THE ROAD THAT IS IF YOUR VISIT WAS INTENDED FOR ME HER FLUSH THE BEAUTY WHICH MUST HAVE STRUCK EVEN HIM BUT MORE THAN ALL ELSE HER YOUTH
BUT HIS ANSWER WAS COURTEOUS ENOUGH IF MISTER BROTHERSON KNEW A PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD BE LEFT UNDISTURBED HE WOULD LISTEN TO HIM IF HE WOULD BE VERY BRIEF
AND THUS POSSIBLY AVERTED THE DOOM WHICH DORIS FELT HAD IN SOME WAY GROWN OUT OF THIS SECRECY WHY SHOULD SHE HAVE FEARED THE DISAPPROVAL OF THIS MAN SHE INWARDLY QUERIED
LEANING TOWARD HER THAT HE MIGHT GET HER FULL ATTENTION HE WAITED TILL HER EYES MET HIS THEN QUIETLY ASKED HAVE YOU EVER NAMED THIS MAN TO YOURSELF
WOULD YOU OBJECT TO DOING THAT AM I ASKING TOO MUCH OF YOU NO NOT AT ALL
DOES HE NEVER MENTION ORLANDO VERY VERY RARELY BUT I'VE NO REASON TO THINK THEY ARE NOT ON GOOD TERMS I KNOW THEY CORRESPOND MISS SCOTT YES MISTER CHALLONER
THRONG AGAIN FROM THE PAST PROVING THAT NOUGHT DIES WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY OF RESURRECTION THEIR POWER OVER THIS BROODING MAN IS SHOWN BY THE FORCE WITH WHICH HIS FINGERS CRUSH AGAINST HIS BOWED FOREHEAD OSWALD AND CHALLONER
HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO LIFT HIS HAND TO HIS HEAD IN A GESTURE OF SURPRISING HELPLESSNESS FOR HIM WHILE SNATCHES OF BROKEN SENTENCES FELL FROM HIS LIPS AMONG WHICH COULD BE HEARD WHAT HAS COME TO ME
UNHAPPY TRUTHS CANNOT BE LONG CONCEALED HOW SOON DOES THE DOCTOR THINK MY BROTHER CAN BEAR THESE INEVITABLE REVELATIONS HE SAID THIS MORNING THAT IF HIS PATIENT WERE AS WELL TO MORROW AS HIS PRESENT CONDITION GIVES PROMISE OF
AND THE EFFORT I MADE TO HIDE MY EMOTION I WAS QUITE UNNERVED I COULD NOT SLEEP TILL MORNING
RISING SUPERIOR TO THE OVERTHROW OF ALL HIS HOPES FOR A WOMAN OF EDITH'S PRINCIPLE TO SEEK DEATH IN A MOMENT OF DESPERATION THE PROVOCATION MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GREAT
AND AS CONVENTIONALITIES WOULD NATURALLY PLACE THEM OSWALD WAS A SENTIMENTALIST BUT VERY RESERVED ABOUT HIS SENTIMENTALITIES IF THESE SUPPOSITIONS WERE TRUE HE HAD HAD A SENTIMENTALIST'S MOTIVE FOR WHAT HE DID
NONE OF THE ALLUSIONS FITTED IN WITH THE FACTS OF THEIR MUTUAL INTERCOURSE BUT THEY MIGHT WITH THOSE OF ANOTHER MAN THEY MIGHT WITH THE POSSIBLE ACTS AND AFFECTIONS OF OSWALD WHOSE TEMPERAMENT WAS WHOLLY DIFFERENT FROM HIS AND WHO MIGHT HAVE LOVED HER
NOTHING WHICH HAD YET PASSED SHOWED THAT THIS MAN REALISED THE FACT THAT OSWALD HAD BEEN KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF MISS CHALLONER'S DEATH IF THESE BROTHERS WERE TO MEET ON THE MORROW
ONLY A FOOL WOULD IGNORE THESE STEEPS OF JAGGED ROCK AND HE WAS NO FOOL ONLY A MAN TO WHOM THE UNEXPECTED HAD HAPPENED A MAN WHO HAD SEEN HIS WAY CLEAR TO THE HORIZON
SHE HAD BEEN THINKING IN THE HOURS WHICH HAD PASSED AND HAD LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF THAT ONE IMPETUOUS MOMENT HER GREETING BETRAYED EMBARRASSMENT AND SHE HESITATED PAINFULLY BEFORE SHE SPOKE
UNLESS MY NAME IS BROUGHT UP IN AN UNDESIRABLE WAY THE HAND ON THE DOOR KNOB MADE A SUDDEN MOVEMENT MISTER BROTHERSON I CAN BEAR NO MORE TO NIGHT WITH YOUR PERMISSION
OSWALD WHY IT WAS OSWALD WHO HAD SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD GO THERE GO WHERE SHE STILL WAS WHY THIS SECOND COINCIDENCE IF THERE WERE NO TIE IF THE CHALLONERS AND OSWALD WERE AS FAR APART AS THEY SEEMED
MISS SCOTT IS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE YOUR PROMISE THAT YOU WILL AVOID ALL DISAGREEABLE TOPICS WITH YOUR BROTHER TILL THE DOCTOR PRONOUNCES HIM STRONG ENOUGH TO MEET THE TROUBLE WHICH AWAITS HIM YOU MEAN
BUT THEY WERE MEANT FOR OSWALD YOU BELIEVE THAT NOW I KNOW IT AND THAT IS WHY I FOUND YOU IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM IT IS PROVIDENCE HAS ROBBED ME OF MY DAUGHTER
TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF SUICIDE DORIS TREMBLED IT WAS NOT SUICIDE SHE DECLARED VEHEMENTLY I HAVE ALWAYS FELT SURE THAT IT WAS NOT BUT TO DAY I KNOW
IT SHOULD BE BUT A TURN A MAN'S JOYS ARE NOT BOUNDED BY HIS LOVES OR EVEN BY THE SATISFACTION OF A PERFECTLY UNTRAMMELLED MIND
SAID SHE NOBODY KNOWS NOT EVEN THE DOCTOR WHAT EFFECT THE NEWS WE SO DREAD TO GIVE HIM WILL HAVE UPON MISTER BROTHERSON YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT
BUT HE HAD ENTERED UPON THE SCENE WITH A FULL APPRECIATION OF THE ORDEAL AWAITING HIM AND HE DID NOT LOSE HIS CALMNESS OR THE CONTROL OF HIS JUDGMENT BE SEATED MISS SCOTT HE ENTREATED TAKING A CHAIR HIMSELF
SET THEMSELVES IN LINES
YOU SEE ME AGAIN MISTER CHALLONER MAY I BEG OF YOU A FEW MINUTES FURTHER CONVERSATION I WILL NOT DETAIN YOU LONG THE GREY HEAD TURNED AND THE MANY EYES WATCHING SHOWED SURPRISE AT THE EXPRESSION OF DISLIKE AND REPULSION
AS GOD HEARS ME FROM THE MOMENT I FIRST SAW HER TO THE MOMENT I SAW HER LAST I DID NOT KNOW NOR DID I FOR A MOMENT DREAM THAT SHE WAS ANYTHING TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER MAN OF MY STAMP AND STATION
AND THE SILENCE GREW HEAVY IT WAS BROKEN WHEN IT WAS BROKEN BY A CRY FROM OSWALD
YES MISTER CHALLONER YOU KNOW ME HE WENT ON ONE FOOT ON THE STEP AND ONE STILL ON THE WALK BEFORE REPLYING SHE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER THEN AS SHE NOTED HIS SURPRISE
NEITHER TOUCHED HIS FEELINGS NOR DETERRED HIS STEP THE AWAKENING OF HIS HEART TO NEW AND PROFOUND EMOTIONS HAD NOT SOFTENED HIM TOWARDS THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS
BUT SHE MISTOOK MY PURPOSE AND AND WHAT ORLANDO HESITATED EVEN HIS IRON NATURE TREMBLED BEFORE THE MISERY HE SAW A MISERY HE WAS DESTINED TO AUGMENT RATHER THAN SOOTHE
THAT MISS SCOTT CAN BE TRUSTED NOT TO FORESTALL THAT MOMENT BY ANY PREVIOUS HINT OF WHAT AWAITS HIM IF SHE SO PROMISES BUT WILL YOU EXACT THIS FROM HER
THE AIR CAR COULD WAIT HE WOULD FIRST HAVE HIS HOUR IN THIS SOLITUDE OF HIS OWN MAKING THE GAZE HE DREADED THE WORDS FROM WHICH HE SHRANK COULD NOT PENETRATE HERE HE MIGHT EVEN SHOUT HER NAME ALOUD
MISTER CHALLONER SIGHED HE HAD REALLY ANTICIPATED SOMETHING FROM THE INTERVIEW THE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS KEEN A MOMENT OF EXPECTATION THE THRILL WHICH COMES TO US ALL UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE SUPERNATURAL
SOMETHING YOU COULD TELL PEOPLE BUT IT ISN'T LIKE THAT IT'S A FEELING A BELIEF I'M SO SURE SURE OF WHAT MISS SCOTT SHE GAVE A GLANCE AT THE DOOR BEFORE STEPPING UP NEARER
WITHOUT A WORD HE WHEELED ABOUT TOWARDS THE DOOR WITHOUT A WORD BROTHERSON STOOD WATCHING HIM GO TILL HE SAW HIS HAND FALL ON THE KNOB WHEN HE QUIETLY PREVENTED HIS EXIT BY SAYING
NOTHING EXCITES MY INTEREST SAVE THAT WHICH ONCE EXCITED HERS I AM TOLD THAT THE DEEPEST INTEREST OF HER LIFE LAY HERE I AM ALSO TOLD THAT IT WAS AN INTEREST QUITE WORTHY OF HER
I HAD NEVER SEEN THE MAN OR ANY PICTURE OF HIM AND HIS FACE WAS CLEAREST OF ALL I SHOULD KNOW IT IF I SAW IT ANYWHERE IT IS IMPRINTED ON MY MEMORY AS PLAINLY AS YOURS OH I HOPE NEVER TO SEE THAT MAN
TELL ME IF I'M TO HATE YOU THROUGH LIFE YEA THROUGH ALL ETERNITY OR IF I MUST SEEK IN SOME UNIMAGINABLE FAILURE OF MY OWN CHARACTER OR CONDUCT THE CAUSE OF HER INTOLERABLE DESPAIR
THERE IS MORE THAN FATE'S CAPRICE IN CHALLONER'S INTEREST IN A MAN HE NEVER SAW GHOSTS OF OLD MEMORIES RISE AND DEMAND A HEARING FACTS TRIVIAL AND COMMONPLACE ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN LOST IN OBLIVION WITH THE DAY WHICH GAVE THEM BIRTH
WELL IT WAS USELESS TO REASON FURTHER GENTLE IN ALL ELSE SHE WAS IMMOVABLE SO FAR AS THIS IDEA WAS CONCERNED AND SEEING THIS HE LET THE MATTER GO AND PREPARED TO TAKE HIS LEAVE
YOU WILL NOT FIND YOUR CONFIDENCE MISPLACED OSWALD IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD FELLOW OF FEW FAULTS I BELIEVE IT NO MAN CAN BE SO UNIVERSALLY BELOVED WITHOUT SOME VERY SUBSTANTIAL CLAIMS TO REGARD
YET HE HAD PROMISED MISS SCOTT THAT HE WOULD ENSURE HIS SILENCE IN THIS REGARD AND IT WAS WITH THIS DIFFICULTY AND NO OTHER HE HAD BEEN STRUGGLING WHEN MISTER BROTHERSON CAME UPON HIM IN THE OTHER ROOM
AND THERE ON A PLATFORM AT THE FURTHER END HOLDING FORTH TO THE AUDIENCE WAS NOT A MAN AS I HAD EXPECTED BUT A WOMAN AND THAT WOMAN MOTHER OLDERSHAW YOU NEVER LISTENED TO ANYTHING MORE ELOQUENT IN YOUR LIFE
UNDER MISTER ARMADALE'S NAME IS MORE THAN MISTER ARMADALE HIMSELF KNOWS THE POINT WAS NOT TOUCHED AT THE INQUEST FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE INQUEST ONLY CONCERNED ITSELF WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER DEATH MISTER ARMADALE AT HIS FRIEND'S REQUEST
AND THE CATS EVERYWHERE ON THE TILES THE SUN HAD SET AND THE SUMMER TWILIGHT WAS DARKENING THE FRETFUL CHILDREN WERE CRYING IN THEIR CRADLES THE HORSE
WHAT AGE DO YOU GUESS HER AT MIDWINTER I SAY SEVEN OR EIGHT AND TWENTY WHAT DO YOU SAY NOTHING I AGREE WITH YOU DO YOU THINK SEVEN OR EIGHT AND TWENTY IS TOO OLD FOR ME
ALL BUT HIS DEATH IS EASY THE WHOLE SERIES OF EVENTS UNDER WHICH I HAVE BEEN BLINDLY CHAFING AND FRETTING FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PAST HAVE BEEN ONE AND ALL THOUGH I WAS TOO STUPID TO SEE IT EVENTS IN MY FAVOR
THE WIDELY DISCORDANT ELEMENTS OF THE GROTESQUE AND THE TERRIBLE WERE FORCED TOGETHER BY THAT SUBTLE LAW OF CONTRAST WHICH IS ONE OF THE LAWS OF MORTAL LIFE
IT OUTDARES ALL DARING BUT IF I CAN ONLY NERVE MYSELF TO FACE ONE TERRIBLE NECESSITY IT IS TO BE DONE I MAY PERSONATE THE RICHLY PROVIDED WIDOW OF ALLAN ARMADALE OF THORPE AMBROSE
IN THIS ENLIGHTENED NINETEENTH CENTURY
IT STRUCK ME JUST NOW AT THE DOOR MISTER ARMADALE THAT WHAT YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO DO FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY YOU MIGHT BE WILLING TO DO FOR THE SECURITY OF ANOTHER PERSON WHAT OTHER PERSON INQUIRED ALLAN
RATHER THAN BREAKFAST WITHOUT HIM I WENT INTO HIS ROOM THERE HE WAS IMMERSED BODY AND SOUL IN HIS HATEFUL WRITING CAN'T YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE TIME THIS MORNING I ASKED HE GOT UP WITH A START CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH IT
THE CHARACTER OF MISTER ARMADALE'S WIDOW WHEN THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH APPEARED IN THE PAPERS BUT WHAT FIRST SET HER ON THIS AND BY WHAT INCONCEIVABLE PROCESS OF DECEPTION SHE CAN HAVE INDUCED MISTER MIDWINTER TO MARRY HER AS THE CERTIFICATE PROVES
LIPARI ISLANDS AND OF THE DEATH OF THEIR CAPTAIN AMONG OTHERS MAY REALLY HAVE BEEN A QUARREL AMONG THE SCOUNDRELS WHO ROBBED MISTER ARMADALE AND SCUTTLED HIS YACHT
ATTACHING NO BLAME TO ANYBODY PROCEEDED LIKE MANY OTHER VERDICTS OF THE SAME KIND FROM AN ENTIRELY SUPERFICIAL INVESTIGATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE KEY TO THE WHOLE MYSTERY IS TO BE FOUND I FIRMLY BELIEVE IN THAT WRETCHED WOMAN'S ATTEMPT TO PERSONATE
HE HAD ASKED AS THE DOCTOR MIGHT HAVE ASKED WHERE WAS THE WONDER OF THEIR SEEING A POOL AT SUNSET WHEN THEY HAD A WHOLE NETWORK OF POOLS WITHIN A FEW HOURS DRIVE OF THEM AND WHAT WAS THERE EXTRAORDINARY IN DISCOVERING A WOMAN AT THE MERE
I HOPE NOT MISTER PEDGIFT I SINCERELY HOPE NOT I PAID A VISIT IN YOUR INTERESTS SIR AT THE COTTAGE THIS MORNING PROCEEDED PEDGIFT SENIOR YOU SHALL HEAR WHAT HAPPENED THERE AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF MAJOR MILROY HAS BEEN EXPRESSING HIS OPINION OF YOU
I DISCOURAGE HIS BRINGING ANY STRANGERS TO SEE ME FOR THOUGH YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE I WAS LAST AT NAPLES I CANNOT BE SURE THAT SOME OF THE MANY PEOPLE I ONCE KNEW IN THIS PLACE MAY NOT BE LIVING STILL
WHO WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT OF A MAN AT HIS AGE FALLING IN LOVE AND WHO WOULD EVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE MISCHIEF THAT WOMAN'S BEAUTY HAS DONE COULD HAVE REACHED AS FAR IN THE DOWNWARD DIRECTION AS OUR SUPERANNUATED OLD CLERK GOOD BY FOR THE PRESENT MY DEAR BOY
THE DOCTOR'S STATEMENT THAT HIS PATIENT WAS THE WIDOW OF A GENTLEMAN NAMED ARMADALE WAS ACCORDINGLY LEFT UNCHALLENGED AND SO THE MATTER HAS BEEN HUSHED UP SHE IS BURIED IN THE GREAT CEMETERY NEAR THE PLACE WHERE SHE DIED NOBODY BUT MISTER MIDWINTER AND MISTER ARMADALE
MISTER BASHWOOD HAD PROVED HIMSELF TO BE WORTHY OF THE CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM THE PEDGIFTS FATHER AND SON HAD AMPLY JUSTIFIED THEIR CLIENT'S GOOD OPINION OF THEM WHEREVER MIDWINTER LOOKED THE PROSPECT WAS BRIGHT THE FUTURE WAS WITHOUT A CLOUD
WITH A PORTRAIT OF MISSUS ARMADALE SUPPORTED ON ONE SIDE BY A VIEW OF THE OLD HOUSE IN SOMERSETSHIRE AND ON THE OTHER BY A PICTURE OF THE YACHT AMONG THE BOOKS WHICH BORE IN FADED INK MISSUS ARMADALE'S INSCRIPTIONS FROM MY FATHER
COASTING CAREFULLY ROUND THE OLD IRON AND THE BROKEN TILES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE IN HIS PATH
AND WE MUST CONSULT SOMEBODY IN THE PROFESSION I DARE SAY IT'S A RISK BUT NOTHING VENTURE NOTHING HAVE
BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT CLOSE TO HIS HEAD SUPPOSING SHE COULD BRING HERSELF TO CONSENT TO THE ELOPEMENT AT ALL WHICH SHE POSITIVELY DECLINED TO PROMISE SHE MUST FIRST INSIST ON DISCOVERING
I HOPE THE TRUMPERY NEWSPAPER HE WRITES FOR WON'T SUCCEED I HOPE HIS RUBBISHING LETTER WILL BE WELL CUT UP BY SOME OTHER NEWSPAPER AS SOON AS IT GETS INTO PRINT WHAT AM I TO DO WITH MYSELF ALL THE MORNING I CAN'T GO OUT IT'S RAINING
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANOTHER TO TRY SAID NEELIE TAKE MY WORD FOR IT PERSISTED ALLAN STOUTLY THERE MUST BE WAYS AND MEANS OF CIRCUMVENTING BLACKSTONE WITHOUT PERJURY IF WE ONLY KNEW OF THEM IT'S A MATTER OF LAW
AND BY DOING THAT I HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST OF THOSE THREE STEPS WHICH WERE ONCE TO LEAD ME THROUGH ARMADALE'S LIFE TO THE FORTUNE AND THE STATION OF ARMADALE'S WIDOW NO MATTER HOW INNOCENT MY INTENTIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON THE WEDDING DAY AND THEY WERE INNOCENT
WE ARE LIVING HERE FOR ECONOMY'S SAKE FAR AWAY FROM THE EXPENSIVE ENGLISH QUARTER IN A SUBURB OF THE CITY ON THE PORTICI SIDE WE HAVE MADE NO TRAVELING ACQUAINTANCES AMONG OUR OWN COUNTRY PEOPLE OUR POVERTY IS AGAINST US
IF YOU ONLY KNEW HIM HE'S ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY MEN WHO APPEAR ONCE OR TWICE IN A CENTURY THE SORT OF MAN WHO WON'T ALLOW YOU TO MAKE A MISTAKE IF YOU TRY ALL I HAVE GOT TO SAY TO HIM PUTTING IT SHORT IS
THE COACHMAN STARTS BY WAY OF THE COMMON AS A MATTER OF COURSE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THAT IS TO SAY ON THE SIDE FURTHEST FROM THE GREAT HOUSE THE SUBURBS IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE
OF THAT OTHER WOMAN'S CASE IT IS TO BE DONE IF I CAN BUT LOOK THE NECESSITY IN THE FACE IT IS TO BE DONE IF I CAN COUNT ON ALLAN ARMADALE'S DEATH IN A GIVEN TIME
THERE'S A MAN BEHIND ONE OF THE HOUSES WE MUST TALK OUT LOUD OF INDIFFERENT THINGS AND LOOK AS IF WE HAD MET BY ACCIDENT ASK ME WHAT I AM DOING OUT LOUD DIRECTLY YOU SHALL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN IF YOU DON'T
NEELIE ANSWERED IN EXPRESSIVE SILENCE SHE HANDED HIM THE POCKET BOOK WITH THE FINAL ENTRY COMPLETED ON THE SIDE OF BAD IN THESE TERMS OUR MARRIAGE IS IMPOSSIBLE
I HAVE NO DOUBT WE SHOULD FIND THE POLICE AND THE PRISON AND THE HAIR CUTTING ALL PUNISHMENTS FOR PERJURY EXACTLY AS I TOLD YOU IF WE LOOKED AT THE NEXT PAGE BUT WE NEEDN'T TROUBLE OURSELVES TO LOOK
CHARGED WITH FRAUDULENTLY REPRESENTING HERSELF TO BE THE MISSING WIDOW OF AN OFFICER IN THE MERCHANT SERVICE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DROWNED THE NAME OF THE PRISONER'S HUSBAND LIVING AND THE NAME OF THE OFFICER
SOME ASSOCIATED WITH ALLAN'S PAST LIFE OTHERS NECESSARY TO HIS DAILY PLEASURES AND PURSUITS AND ALL PLAINLY TESTIFYING THAT THE ROOM WHICH HE HABITUALLY OCCUPIED AT THORPE AMBROSE
WHO INSISTED ON GOING WITH HIM FOLLOWED HER TO THE GRAVE AND NOTHING HAS BEEN INSCRIBED ON THE TOMBSTONE
OR THE CHANNEL ISLANDS OR ANYWHERE ELSE YOU LIKE MY FRIEND THE CLERK IS A TOTAL STRANGER TO THORPE AMBROSE AND EVERYBODY IN IT WHICH IS ONE RECOMMENDATION AND IN FIVE MINUTES TIME HE'D PUT ME UP TO WHAT TO DO WHICH IS ANOTHER
A VERY COMMON ONE BOTH AS TO CHRISTIAN AND SURNAME HAPPENED TO BE IDENTICALLY THE SAME THERE WAS MONEY TO BE GOT BY IT SORELY WANTED BY THE PRISONER'S HUSBAND TO WHOM SHE WAS DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED
BLACKSTONE MIGHT PUT IT IN SHORTER SENTENCES I THINK IF HE CAN'T PUT IT IN FEWER WORDS CHEER UP NEELIE
IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR THE PRESENT THERE ARE SOME HOURS STILL TO SPARE BEFORE THE POST GOES OUT SUPPOSE I ASKED ARMADALE TO LEND ME THE MONEY I SHOULD ENJOY GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF HIM
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO PROPOSE CRIED THE HEADLONG ALLAN
AT THE BOTTOM OF MORE OF THIS MISCHIEF THAN WE SHALL EVER FIND OUT AND TO HAVE PROFITED BY THE SELF IMPOSED SILENCE OF MISTER MIDWINTER AND MISTER ARMADALE AS ROGUES PERPETUALLY PROFIT BY THE MISFORTUNES AND NECESSITIES OF HONEST MEN
THE MEDICAL MEN ARE OF OPINION THAT THE POOR LADY IS SINKING AT LAST IT MAY BE A QUESTION OF WEEKS OR A QUESTION OF MONTHS THEY CAN SAY NO MORE
WE HAVE FOUND OUT QUITE ENOUGH ALREADY IT'S ALL OVER WITH US I MUST GO TO SCHOOL ON SATURDAY AND YOU MUST MANAGE TO FORGET ME AS SOON AS YOU CAN PERHAPS WE MAY MEET IN AFTER LIFE
SHE WAS THINKING OF HIM SHE HAD JUST OPENED HER DESK TO WRITE TO MISSUS OLDERSHAW AND HER PEN HAD THAT MOMENT TRACED THE OPENING LINE
AMID ALL THE THICKENING COMPLICATIONS NOW IMPENDING OVER THEIR HEADS WITH THE SHADOW OF MEDITATED MURDER STEALING TOWARD ONE OF THEM ALREADY FROM THE LURKING PLACE THAT HID MISS GWILT
THAT WRETCHED OLD BASHWOOD HAS CONFIRMED THE FEARS I TOLD YOU I HAD ABOUT HIM WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT BACK HERE FROM LONDON THERE IS NO KIND OF DOUBT THAT HE HAS REALLY LOST ALL THE LITTLE REASON HE EVER HAD HE IS PERFECTLY HARMLESS AND PERFECTLY HAPPY
AS LONG AS I HEARD HER SHE WAS NEVER ONCE AT A LOSS FOR A WORD ANYWHERE I SHALL THINK LESS OF ORATORY AS A HUMAN ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AFTER THAT SUNDAY EVENING
AT THE TOP OF THE LEFT HAND PAGE SHE WROTE THE WORD BAD GOOD MEANS WHERE THE LAW IS ON OUR SIDE SHE EXPLAINED AND BAD MEANS WHERE THE LAW IS AGAINST US
MY ONE MOTIVE FOR NOT TELLING YOU THIS BEFORE SPRANG FROM MY DREAD OF INTERESTING YOU IN THE ROOM WHICH I LOOKED AT WITH HORROR AS THE SECOND OF THE SCENES POINTED AT IN THE DREAM FORGIVE ME THIS ALSO AND YOU WILL HAVE FORGIVEN ME ALL
WHAT ARE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD ABOUT GO ON AND I SHALL SEE OH ALL RIGHT I'LL GO ON HERE WE ARE
DAY AFTER DAY THE HOURS THAT HE GIVES TO HIS HATEFUL WRITING GROW LONGER AND LONGER
AND YOU WILL WISH YOU HAD MARRIED HER INSTEAD OF ME AS ALLAN OPENED HIS LIPS FOR A FINAL OUTBURST OF ASSEVERATION THE STABLE CLOCK AT THE GREAT HOUSE WAS FAINTLY AUDIBLE IN THE DISTANCE STRIKING THE HOUR
IN EVERY CASUAL MOVEMENT THAT ESCAPED HER EXPRESSING THAT SUBTLE MIXTURE OF THE VOLUPTUOUS AND THE MODEST WHICH OF THE MANY ATTRACTIVE EXTREMES THAT MEET IN WOMEN
I CAN TELL YOU MISTER ARMADALE IT DWELLS ON MINE YOU KNOW MY OPINION OF MISS GWILT AND YOU KNOW WHAT MISS GWILT HERSELF HAS DONE THIS VERY EVENING TO JUSTIFY THAT OPINION EVEN IN YOUR EYES
WHEN HE PROMISES TO HAVE THE WORKMEN OUT OF THE HOUSE IN A GIVEN TIME AND WHEN THE TIME COMES AS MY POOR MOTHER USED TO SAY THE WORKMEN NEVER GO IS THERE NOTHING ABOUT LOVE ASKED NEELIE LOOK A LITTLE LOWER DOWN
NO SUCH IDEA HAD EVER ENTERED YOUR HEAD DID SHE SEEM RELIEVED ASKED ALLAN
THERE IS THE CASE AS HE CALLED IT ONLY QUOTED TO TAUNT ME UTTERLY UNLIKE MY OWN CASE AT THE TIME THERE IT HAS BEEN WAITING AND LURKING FOR ME THROUGH ALL THE CHANGES IN MY LIFE
HOW LONG HE REITERATED HAVE YOU WORSHIPPED THE VERY GROUND SHE TREADS ON LONGER THAN YOU THINK FOR I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU WITH ALL MY SECRETS DON'T TRUST ME NONSENSE I WILL TRUST YOU
HOW HAPPY I WAS IN THE FIRST DAYS THAT FOLLOWED OUR MARRIAGE AND HOW HAPPY I MADE HIM ONLY TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED AND THAT TIME IS A BY GONE TIME ALREADY I TRY TO THINK OF ANYTHING I MIGHT HAVE SAID OR DONE WRONGLY ON MY SIDE
A MAN IN MY PLACE WOULD FIND REFUGE IN DRINK I'M NOT A MAN AND I CAN'T DRINK I'LL DAWDLE OVER MY DRESSES AND PUT MY THINGS TIDY HAS AN HOUR PASSED MORE THAN AN HOUR
AND SHE HAD UTTERLY CONFOUNDED ALLAN BY INQUIRING WHETHER THE CONTEMPLATED ELOPEMENT WAS AN OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY THE LAW
WERE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS A SORE SUBJECT BY ALL PERSONS ZEALOUS FOR THE REPUTATION OF THE TOWN HERE NATURE WAS UNINVITING MAN WAS POOR
WE HAD A TOUGH FIGHT BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH A POINT OCCURRED TO ME JUST AS I GOT UP TO GO AND I WENT BACK TO MY CHAIR AND SETTLED THE QUESTION IN NO TIME OF COURSE I STAYED AT OUR HOTEL IN COVENT GARDEN WILLIAM THE WAITER
AS FOR THE MATTER OF THE SERMON I MAY DESCRIBE IT AS A NARRATIVE OF MISSUS OLDERSHAW'S EXPERIENCE AMONG DILAPIDATED WOMEN PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED IN THE PIOUS AND PENITENTIAL STYLE YOU WILL ASK WHAT SORT OF AUDIENCE IT WAS PRINCIPALLY WOMEN AUGUSTUS AND
SOMETIMES LEADS TO GREAT RESULTS I DOUBT HOWEVER IF YOU WILL FIND IT LEADING TO MUCH ON THIS OCCASION ALL I KNOW OF THE MYSTERY OF THE SANITARIUM I KNOW FROM MISTER ARMADALE AND HE IS ENTIRELY IN THE DARK ON MORE THAN ONE POINT OF IMPORTANCE
WHEN I LOOKED ROUND TO WISH MISS NEELIE GOOD MORNING TOO SHE WAS GONE YOU SEEM RESTLESS MISTER ARMADALE REMARKED PEDGIFT SENIOR AS ALLAN FEELING THE STING OF OLD RECOLLECTIONS SUDDENLY STARTED OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND BEGAN PACING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
I HAVE BEEN READING AND THINKING AND THANKS TO MY DIARY I HAVE GOT THROUGH AN HOUR WHAT A TIME IT WAS WHAT A LIFE IT WAS AT THORPE AMBROSE I WONDER I KEPT MY SENSES IT MAKES MY HEART BEAT
AND TURNS MY WAY AND TRIES TO LOOK ME DOWN AGAIN
WHEN I HAD GOT ON LINE BY LINE TO THOSE WORDS IT BURST ON ME LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN AN INSTANT I SAW IT AS PLAINLY AS I SEE IT NOW IT IS HORRIBLE IT IS UNHEARD OF
I MENTIONED THAT A POINT HAD OCCURRED TO ME SIR REMARKED PEDGIFT SENIOR
WITHOUT SOONER OR LATER BITTERLY REPENTING IT YOU WILL BITTERLY REPENT IT
NOT A HARD WORD NOT A HARD LOOK ESCAPES HIM IT IS ONLY AT NIGHT WHEN I HEAR HIM SIGHING IN HIS SLEEP AND SOMETIMES WHEN I SEE HIM DREAMING IN THE MORNING HOURS THAT I KNOW HOW HOPELESSLY I AM LOSING THE LOVE HE ONCE FELT FOR ME HE HIDES
I'LL GO OVER THE BACKS OF TEN THOUSAND CRIED ALLAN WARMLY
EXCLAIMED ALLAN INDIGNANTLY WHY DID YOU LEAVE HER A MOMENT IN DOUBT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I AM A LAWYER MISTER ARMADALE REJOINED PEDGIFT SENIOR DRYLY EVEN IN MOMENTS OF SENTIMENT UNDER CONVENIENT TREES WITH A PRETTY GIRL ON MY ARM
THE MORAL OF ALL THIS IS AS THE CHILDREN'S STORYBOOKS SAY THAT NOT A SINGLE WITNESS HAS COME TO THIS HOUSE WHO COULD DECLARE IF ANY AFTER INQUIRY TOOK PLACE IN ENGLAND THAT MIDWINTER AND I HAD BEEN LIVING HERE AS MAN AND WIFE
AS I HOPE TO BE SAVED ALL THE OLD HARRIDANS OF THE WORLD OF FASHION WHOM
I MUST DO SOMETHING TO RELIEVE MY MIND CAN I GO TO MY PIANO NO I'M NOT FIT FOR IT WORK
WHETHER THERE WAS ANY FEAR OF THE POLICE BEING CONCERNED IN HER MARRIAGE AS WELL AS THE PARSON AND THE CLERK ALLAN BEING A MAN OUGHT TO KNOW AND TO ALLAN SHE LOOKED FOR INFORMATION
LAW OF HUSBAND AND WIFE HERE'S A BIT I DON'T UNDERSTAND TO BEGIN WITH IT MAY BE OBSERVED GENERALLY THAT THE LAW CONSIDERS MARRIAGE IN THE LIGHT OF A CONTRACT
MIDWINTER'S SHYNESS IS AGAINST US AND WITH THE WOMEN MY PERSONAL APPEARANCE IS AGAINST US THE MEN FROM WHOM MY HUSBAND GETS HIS INFORMATION FOR THE NEWSPAPER MEET HIM AT THE CAFE AND NEVER COME HERE
ALLAN'S DEAREST INTERESTS TO HAVE REVEALED THE DISCOVERY OF HIS MOTHER'S ROOM BUT ONE DOUBT STILL CLOSED HIS LIPS THE DOUBT WHETHER MISSUS ARMADALE'S CONDUCT IN MADEIRA HAD BEEN KEPT SECRET ON HER RETURN TO ENGLAND
AND TO PLEDGE ME TO INVIOLABLE SECRECY ON THE SUBJECT OF OUR INTERVIEW SHE WAS PARTICULARLY DESIROUS THAT YOU SHOULD HEAR NOTHING ABOUT IT IF YOU ARE AT ALL ANXIOUS ON YOUR SIDE TO KNOW WHY I AM NOW BETRAYING HER CONFIDENCE
BUT NEELIE WAS NOT SATISFIED EVEN YET SHE REVERTED TO FIRST PRINCIPLES AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHETHER ALLAN WAS QUITE SURE HE LOVED HER
SHALL I READ NO BOOKS DON'T INTEREST ME I HATE THE WHOLE TRIBE OF AUTHORS I THINK I SHALL LOOK BACK THROUGH THESE PAGES AND LIVE MY LIFE OVER AGAIN WHEN I WAS PLOTTING AND PLANNING
HIGH STREET DECEMBER TWENTIETH MY DEAR AUGUSTUS YOUR LETTER REACHED ME YESTERDAY YOU SEEM TO BE MAKING THE MOST OF YOUR YOUTH AS YOU CALL IT WITH A VENGEANCE WELL ENJOY YOUR HOLIDAY I MADE THE MOST OF MY YOUTH WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE AND WONDERFUL TO RELATE
AND LEAVE ME TO GO THE OTHER WAY I DON'T WANT YOU I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE MAN BEHIND THE HOUSES
SHE HAD HER HUSBAND BY HER SIDE AND HER CHILDREN ON THE SEAT OPPOSITE AT THE MOMENT WHEN I SAW HER SHE WAS LAUGHING AND TALKING IN HIGH SPIRITS A SPARKLING LIGHT HEARTED HAPPY WOMAN AH MY LADY WHEN YOU WERE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER
IF YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN YOURSELF YOU WOULDN'T THINK SEVEN OR EIGHT AND TWENTY TOO OLD WOULD YOU I CAN'T SAY I SHOULD THINK IT TOO OLD IF IF YOU WERE REALLY FOND OF HER ONCE MORE THERE WAS NO ANSWER
I LOOKED OVER THE LARGE BOX FIRST WHICH I USUALLY LEAVE OPEN AND THEN I TRIED THE SMALL BOX WHICH I ALWAYS KEEP LOCKED FROM ONE THING TO THE OTHER I CAME AT LAST TO THE BUNDLE OF LETTERS AT THE BOTTOM
AND THAT ONE CIRCUMSTANCE AFTER MY OLD BAILEY EXPERIENCE IS ENOUGH FOR ME AS TO EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM THERE IS NOT A JOT AND AS TO RETRIBUTION OVERTAKING HIM I CAN ONLY SAY I HEARTILY HOPE RETRIBUTION MAY PROVE IN THE LONG RUN
BUT IT HAS NOT QUITE FAILED ME YET IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS MOTHER OLDERSHAW'S LETTER WAITING OBSTINATELY TO BE ANSWERED AND HERE AM I NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT YET SHALL I ANSWER IT OR NOT
THE SUMMING UP OF THE JUDGE WAS ADMIRABLE HE DWELT UPON EVERY POINT THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED IN FAVOUR OF THE PRISONER BUT AS HE PROCEEDED IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS TOO CONVINCING TO ADMIT OF DOUBT
THERE WAS ANOTHER FEELING ALSO WHICH WAS NEARLY AS BAD FOR AS A CHILD THAT FEARS IT HAS GONE BLIND IN A LONG TUNNEL IF THERE IS NO LIGHT SO ERE THE EARTH HAD BEEN MANY MINUTES HIDDEN I BECAME HALF FRIGHTENED LEST WE MIGHT NOT HAVE BROKEN AWAY FROM IT CLEAN AND FOR EVER
BUT IN SPITE OF MY SEEING NOT A FEW WHOSE LOOKS WERE BENIGN AND NOBLE I COULD NOT HELP ASKING MYSELF CONCERNING THE GREATER NUMBER OF THOSE WHOM I MET WHETHER EREWHON WOULD BE A BETTER COUNTRY IF THEIR EXPRESSION WERE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL
I DID TRY SOMETIMES BEING IMPELLED TO DO SO BY A STRONG SENSE OF DUTY AND BY MY DEEP REGRET THAT SO MUCH THAT WAS ADMIRABLE SHOULD BE DOOMED TO AGES IF NOT ETERNITY OF TORTURE
IF THE MAID HAD NOT GONE OFF INTO A FIT OF HYSTERICS AND AWAKENED US TO THE NECESSITY OF SELF CONTROL THEN BRIEFLY AND PLAINLY I UNFOLDED WHAT I PROPOSED I SHOWED HER THE DARKEST SIDE
HE FELT THE NEED OF TWO RULES OF LIFE ONE FOR THE SEEN AND THE OTHER FOR THE UNSEEN SIDE OF THINGS FOR THE LAWS AFFECTING THE SEEN WORLD HE CLAIMED THE SANCTION OF SEEN POWERS FOR THE UNSEEN
WE PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS OF MORE OR LESS CONSIDERABLE HOUSES AND AT LAST TURNING ROUND A CORNER WE CAME UPON A LARGE PIAZZA AT THE END OF WHICH WAS A MAGNIFICENT BUILDING
AND THAT HE HOPED THUS TO OBTAIN IT ON MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS IF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE CASE
NAMELY ARE YOU WICKED OR NOT THIS HAS BEEN DECIDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE NEITHER CAN I HESITATE FOR A SINGLE MOMENT TO SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN DECIDED JUSTLY YOU ARE A BAD AND DANGEROUS PERSON
WAS EXTENUATED TO A DEGREE THAT ROUSED THE INDIGNATION OF THE COURT WE SHALL HAVE SAID THE JUDGE THESE CRUDE AND SUBVERSIONARY BOOKS FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL IT IS RECOGNISED AS AN AXIOM OF MORALITY
I COULD NEVER THINK THAT THEIR PROFESSED RELIGION WAS MORE THAN SKIN DEEP BUT THEY HAD ANOTHER WHICH THEY CARRIED WITH THEM INTO ALL THEIR ACTIONS AND ALTHOUGH NO ONE FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THINGS WOULD SUSPECT IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE AT ALL
TO ALL WHICH I COULD ONLY SAY THAT THE THING HAD BEEN ACTUALLY KNOWN TO HAPPEN AND THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL WELL AUTHENTICATED INSTANCES OF PEOPLE HAVING DIED AND COME TO LIFE AGAIN INSTANCES WHICH NO MAN IN HIS SENSES COULD DOUBT
SHE MIGHT SAY WHAT SHE PLEASED BUT HER MANNER CARRIED NO CONVICTION AND LATER ON I SAW SIGNS OF GENERAL INDIFFERENCE TO THESE BANKS THAT WERE NOT TO BE MISTAKEN
AND AS IT WAS NOW ONLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS SINCE THERE HAD BEEN ONE OF THESE DISTRIBUTIONS PEOPLE FELT THAT THEY COULD NOT HOPE FOR ANOTHER IN THEIR OWN TIME AND PREFERRED INVESTMENTS WHEREBY THEY GOT SOME MORE TANGIBLE RETURN ALL WHICH SHE SAID
I HAD NEVER HOWEVER YET BEEN ASKED TO GO WITH THEM MYSELF
A THING NOW FREQUENTLY DONE BY CERTAIN BUBBLE COMPANIES WHICH BY DOING AN ILLEGITIMATE TRADE HAD DRAWN MANY CUSTOMERS AWAY AND EVEN THE SHAREHOLDERS WERE FEWER THAN FORMERLY OWING TO THE INNOVATIONS OF THESE UNSCRUPULOUS PERSONS
I CANNOT DESCRIBE ALL THAT TOOK PLACE IN THESE INNER PRECINCTS FOR A SINISTER LOOKING PERSON IN A BLACK GOWN CAME AND MADE UNPLEASANT GESTURES AT ME FOR PEEPING I HAPPENED TO HAVE IN MY POCKET ONE OF THE MUSICAL BANK PIECES WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN ME BY MISSUS NOSNIBOR
QUESTIONS TO WHICH THERE WOULD BE NO END WERE THEIR INTRODUCTION ONCE TOLERATED AND WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THROWING THE ONLY GUILT ON THE TISSUES OF THE PRIMORDIAL CELL OR ON THE ELEMENTARY GASES
THESE ARE THE THINGS WHICH GREET HIM AND HE SMILES TO HIMSELF AS THE TERROR PASSES AWAY AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT IS FORGOTTEN SO FARED IT NOW WITH OURSELVES WE HAD BEEN IN THE WATER SOME TWO OR THREE HOURS
BUT THE WORDS STUCK IN MY THROAT AS SOON AS I BEGAN WHETHER A PROFESSIONAL MISSIONARY MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE I KNOW NOT SUCH PERSONS MUST DOUBTLESS KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF CONVERSION
WHO PROFESSED THEMSELVES MUCH MOVED AS SOON AS THE SINGING WAS OVER THE LADIES REQUESTED ME TO STAY WHERE I WAS WHILE THEY WENT INSIDE THE PLACE FROM WHICH IT HAD SEEMED TO COME DURING THEIR ABSENCE CERTAIN REFLECTIONS FORCED THEMSELVES UPON ME
ABOUT MY GOING WITH THEM AND AFTER A LITTLE PARLEYING AND MANY INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER I WAS PERFECTLY SURE THAT I MYSELF WISHED TO GO IT WAS DECIDED THAT I MIGHT DO SO
AND HAVE ALL THAT WE HOLD PRECIOUS AT THEIR MERCY A TIME OF UNIVERSAL DEPHYSICALISATION WOULD ENSUE MEDICINE VENDORS OF ALL KINDS WOULD ABOUND IN OUR STREETS AND ADVERTISE IN ALL OUR NEWSPAPERS THERE IS ONE REMEDY FOR THIS AND ONE ONLY
WAS VERY MELANCHOLY TO THINK OF HAVING MADE THESE LAST ADMISSIONS SHE RETURNED TO HER ORIGINAL STATEMENT NAMELY THAT EVERY ONE IN THE COUNTRY REALLY SUPPORTED THESE BANKS AS TO THE FEWNESS OF THE PEOPLE
BUT BEFORE THAT MINUTE WAS OVER I WAS AT SUCH A HEIGHT ABOVE THE CITY THAT NOTHING COULD HARM ME AND EVERY SECOND BOTH THE TOWN AND THE CROWD BECAME SMALLER AND MORE CONFUSED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME
THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY WAS THOROUGHLY DEVOTED TO THESE ESTABLISHMENTS AND ANY SIGN OF THEIR BEING IN DANGER WOULD BRING IN SUPPORT FROM THE MOST UNEXPECTED QUARTERS IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE PEOPLE KNEW THEM TO BE SO VERY SAFE
AND DOUBT IMPOSSIBLE THEY WOULD CONSIDER THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY AND JUSTLY OUTRAGED AND ACCUSE THE SPEAKER OF BEING UNWELL
WHEREBY SOME PEOPLE MIGHT GAIN PRESENT SATISFACTION TO THEMSELVES AT THE COST OF INFINITE DAMAGE TO OTHERS THAT THE DOCTRINE TENDED TO ENCOURAGE THE POOR IN THEIR IMPROVIDENCE AND IN A DEBASING ACQUIESCENCE IN ILLS WHICH THEY MIGHT WELL REMEDY
BUT THERE WAS STILL A ROSY GLEAM IN THE SKY OVER THE RUINS OF THE RAILWAY STATION BELOW ME WAS THE CITY ALREADY TWINKLING WITH LIGHTS WHILE BEYOND IT STRETCHED THE PLAINS FOR MANY A LEAGUE UNTIL THEY BLENDED WITH THE SKY I JUST NOTED THESE THINGS BUT I COULD NOT HEED THEM
AND TO ENTIRELY REFORM THE CONSTITUTION OF YOUR WHOLE BODY I ENTERTAIN BUT LITTLE HOPE THAT YOU WILL PAY ATTENTION TO MY ADVICE YOU ARE ALREADY FAR TOO ABANDONED DID IT REST WITH MYSELF I SHOULD ADD NOTHING IN MITIGATION OF THE SENTENCE WHICH I HAVE PASSED
I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE PERSUADED HALF A DOZEN OF THEM TO COME OVER TO ENGLAND AND GO UPON THE STAGE FOR THEY HAD MOST OF THEM A KEEN SENSE OF HUMOUR AND A TASTE FOR ACTING THEY WOULD BE OF GREAT USE TO US
ONE RULE RUNS INTO AND AGAINST ANOTHER
SHE CAME WITH EARLY DAWN MUFFLED UP AND IN HER MAID'S DRESS SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GONE TO AN EARLY PERFORMANCE AT ONE OF THE MUSICAL BANKS
HE WAS CONVINCED THAT EVEN THOUGH THE BALLOON SHOULD MOUNT A FEW FEET INTO THE AIR IT WOULD COLLAPSE IMMEDIATELY WHEREON I SHOULD FALL AND BREAK MY NECK AND HE SHOULD BE RID OF ME HE DEMONSTRATED THIS TO HER SO CONVINCINGLY THAT SHE WAS ALARMED AND TRIED TO TALK ME INTO GIVING UP THE IDEA
UNTIL THE PLEASURE OF THE COURT BE FURTHER KNOWN WHEN THE SENTENCE WAS CONCLUDED THE PRISONER ACKNOWLEDGED IN A FEW SCARCELY AUDIBLE WORDS THAT HE WAS JUSTLY PUNISHED AND THAT HE HAD HAD A FAIR TRIAL
AND NOW BEGAN A TIME DREAM LIKE AND DELIRIOUS OF WHICH I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I SHALL EVER RECOVER A DISTINCT RECOLLECTION SOME THINGS I CAN RECALL AS THAT WE WERE ERE LONG ENVELOPED IN VAPOUR WHICH FROZE UPON MY MOUSTACHE AND WHISKERS
A WORSHIP AT ONCE THE MOST POWERFUL YET MOST DEVOID OF FORMALISM THAT I EVER MET WITH BUT IN PRACTICE THINGS WORKED BETTER THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AND THE CONFLICTING CLAIMS OF YDGRUN AND THE GODS
IT IS THAT THE AMOUNT SO KEPT HAD NO DIRECT COMMERCIAL VALUE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD I AM SURE THAT THE MANAGERS AND CASHIERS OF THE MUSICAL BANKS WERE NOT PAID IN THEIR OWN CURRENCY
CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT ESCAPE THOUGH BUSILY ENGAGED IN TRANSLATING THE EXTRACTS GIVEN IN THE LAST FIVE CHAPTERS I WAS ALSO LAYING MATTERS IN TRAIN FOR MY ESCAPE WITH AROWHENA AND INDEED IT WAS HIGH TIME
WERE ARRANGED BY UNWRITTEN COMPROMISES FOR THE MOST PART IN YDGRUN'S FAVOUR WHICH IN NINETY NINE CASES OUT OF A HUNDRED WERE VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD
WHERE THERE WOULD BE NO BAR TO OUR GETTING MARRIED AND THAT I COULD SEE NO OTHER HOPE SHE MADE NO RESISTANCE NOT A SIGN OR HINT OF DOUBT OR HESITATION SHE WOULD DO ALL I TOLD HER AND COME WHENEVER I WAS READY SO I BADE HER SEND HER MAID TO MEET ME NIGHTLY
NEITHER CAN IT BE PERMITTED THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE CHANCE OF CORRUPTING UNBORN BEINGS WHO MIGHT HEREAFTER PESTER YOU THE UNBORN MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO COME NEAR YOU AND THIS NOT SO MUCH FOR THEIR PROTECTION FOR THEY ARE OUR NATURAL ENEMIES AS FOR OUR OWN
I ALSO SAW MY HOSTESS AND HER DAUGHTERS AND TWO OR THREE OTHER LADIES ALSO THREE OR FOUR OLD WOMEN
OR AS IN CHINESE PRONUNCIATION WHEREIN I AM TOLD THAT THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE IN ACCENTUATION OR TONE OF VOICE ALTERS THE MEANING OF A WHOLE SENTENCE
I FANCIED THAT THE OBJECTS ON THE PLAIN BENEATH BEGAN TO MOVE FROM UNDER ME I DID NOT FEEL SO MUCH AS A BREATH OF WIND AND COULD NOT SUPPOSE THAT THE BALLOON ITSELF WAS TRAVELLING I WAS THEREFORE WONDERING WHAT THIS STRANGE MOVEMENT OF FIXED OBJECTS COULD MEAN
IT NEED NOT PERHAPS BE SUCH A STRONG BODY SHE SAID THIS BECAUSE SHE SAW THAT I WAS THINKING OF THE OLD AND INFIRM LOOKING FOLKS WHOM I HAD SEEN IN THE BANK BUT IT MUST BE IN PERFECT HEALTH IN THIS CASE THE LESS ACTIVE STRENGTH IT HAD
SO FAR HOWEVER AS I COULD COLLECT ANYTHING CERTAIN I GATHERED THAT THEY HAVE TWO DISTINCT CURRENCIES EACH UNDER THE CONTROL OF ITS OWN BANKS AND MERCANTILE CODES ONE OF THESE THE ONE WITH THE MUSICAL BANKS
INTO MISTER NOSNIBOR'S GARDEN AT ABOUT DUSK ON THE FOLLOWING EVENING I CAME AT THE APPOINTED TIME
AND AFTER AN IMPARTIAL TRIAL BEFORE A JURY OF YOUR COUNTRYMEN
I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND NEITHER CAN I QUITE DO SO NOW THOUGH I BEGIN TO SEE BETTER WHAT THEY MEAN WHY A SINGLE CURRENCY SHOULD NOT SUFFICE THEM IT WOULD SEEM TO ME AS THOUGH ALL THEIR DEALINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN THUS GREATLY SIMPLIFIED
AGAINST THE JUSTICE OF THE VERDICT I CAN SAY NOTHING THE EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU WAS CONCLUSIVE AND IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO PASS SUCH A SENTENCE UPON YOU AS SHALL SATISFY THE ENDS OF THE LAW THAT SENTENCE MUST BE A VERY SEVERE ONE
THEY DECLARED ITS ADVANTAGES TO BE INCALCULABLE AND EVEN PROFESSED TO CONSIDER THE IMMEDIATE RETURN TO BE FAR LARGER THAN THEY WERE ENTITLED TO AND SO SHE RAN ON
FORGETTING THAT WHILE TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF AN UNSEEN KINGDOM IS BAD
FOR AS THE GAMUT WAS STILL UNKNOWN THERE WAS NO MUSIC IN THE COUNTRY WHICH COULD BE AGREEABLE TO A EUROPEAN EAR
I SAID MY INTENTION WAS TO GO UP INTO THE SKY AND PREVAIL UPON THE AIR GOD BY MEANS OF A PERSONAL INTERVIEW I OWN THAT THIS PROPOSITION BORDERED ON THE IDOLATROUS BUT I HAVE LONG SINCE REPENTED OF IT AND AM LITTLE LIKELY EVER TO REPEAT THE OFFENCE
IT WAS EXPECTED OF THEM THAT THEY SHOULD APPEAR TO DO SO BUT THIS WAS ALL THE LESS THOUGHTFUL OF THEM DID NOT SEEM PARTICULARLY UNHAPPY BUT MANY WERE PLAINLY SICK AT HEART THOUGH PERHAPS THEY HARDLY KNEW IT
WE HAD PARTED WITH EVERYTHING BUT THE CLOTHES WHICH WE HAD UPON OUR BACKS FOOD AND WATER WERE GONE ALL THROWN OUT TO THE WHEELING ALBATROSSES IN ORDER TO SAVE US A FEW HOURS OR EVEN MINUTES FROM THE SEA
EVEN HER MOST DEVOTED WORSHIPPERS WERE A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HER AND SERVED HER MORE WITH HEART AND IN DEED THAN WITH THEIR TONGUES THEIRS WAS NO LIP SERVICE ON THE CONTRARY
ON THE SCORE THAT THEIR DOCTRINE WAS BASED UPON NO SORT OF FOUNDATION ALSO THAT IT WAS IMMORAL IN ITS TENDENCY
THAT MY ATTEMPTED ASCENT WOULD BE MADE AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST ME IN CASE I DID NOT SUCCEED IN PREVAILING ON THE AIR GOD TO STOP THE DROUGHT NEITHER KING NOR QUEEN HAD ANY IDEA THAT I MEANT GOING RIGHT AWAY IF I COULD GET THE WIND TO TAKE ME
SO I TRIED TO TIP HIM WITH IT BUT HAVING SEEN WHAT IT WAS HE BECAME SO ANGRY THAT I HAD TO GIVE HIM A PIECE OF THE OTHER KIND OF MONEY TO PACIFY HIM WHEN I HAD DONE THIS HE BECAME CIVIL DIRECTLY AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE I VENTURED TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK
I GREATLY DOUBT WHETHER THE EREWHONIANS ARE YET PREPARED FOR ANY BETTER RELIGION
MY NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO BREAK THE PLAN TO AROWHENA AND TO DEVISE THE MEANS FOR GETTING HER INTO THE CAR I FELT SURE THAT SHE WOULD COME WITH ME BUT HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF HER COURAGE FAILED HER THE WHOLE THING SHOULD COME TO NOTHING
TO QUOTE YOUR POET THAT MAKES CALAMITY OF SO LONG A LIFE IS THE CONSIDERATION THAT THOUGH CALAMITY MAY LIVE LONG THE SUFFERER MAY LIVE LONGER STILL
WHO WERE TO WITNESS MY ASCENT THEY WERE NOT DUE YET FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS AND DURING THIS TIME A HUNDRED THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN ANY ONE OF WHICH WOULD UNDO ME AT LAST THE BALLOON WAS FULL
AND THE WAILING OF THE WIND WHICH LAST THEY TRIED TO IMITATE IN MELANCHOLY CADENCES THAT AT TIMES DEGENERATED INTO A HOWL TO MY THINKING THE NOISE WAS HIDEOUS BUT IT PRODUCED A GREAT EFFECT UPON MY COMPANIONS
COULD EASILY INSTRUCT HER WORKMEN HOW TO PROVIDE HER EAGERNESS TO SEE SO STRANGE A SIGHT AS THE ASCENT OF A HUMAN BEING INTO THE SKY OVERCAME ANY SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE OTHERWISE FELT
OF MILLIONS OF PAST GENERATIONS AGAINST THE COMPARATIVELY SHALLOW CONSCIOUSLY REASONING AND EPHEMERAL CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THAT OF THE LAST THIRTY OR FORTY THE SAVING FEATURE
THE WINDOWS WERE FILLED WITH STAINED GLASS DESCRIPTIVE OF THE PRINCIPAL COMMERCIAL INCIDENTS OF THE BANK FOR MANY AGES IN A REMOTE PART OF THE BUILDING THERE WERE MEN AND BOYS SINGING THIS WAS THE ONLY DISTURBING FEATURE
WHAT LITTLE HEED PEOPLE PAID TO THE MOST PRECIOUS OF ALL INSTITUTIONS I COULD SAY NOTHING IN REPLY BUT I HAVE EVER BEEN OF OPINION THAT THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND DO APPROXIMATELY KNOW WHERE THEY GET THAT WHICH DOES THEM GOOD
AND EVEN WHEN THE EVIL THAT WE DREADED WAS UPON US AND THAT WHICH WE GREATLY FEARED HAD COME WE SAT IN THE CAR OF THE BALLOON WITH THE WATERS UP TO OUR MIDDLE AND STILL SMILED WITH A GHASTLY HOPEFULNESS TO ONE ANOTHER
WHICH THEY WOULD NOT TOLERATE AND EVEN APPLAUD IN THEIR DAILY NEWSPAPERS IF WRITTEN ANONYMOUSLY WHILE IF THE SAME THING WERE SAID WITHOUT AMBIGUITY TO THEIR FACES
AND TO LET THEM BE SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME IN THEIR HANDS AND PURSES NOT ONLY THIS BUT THEY WOULD STICK TO IT THAT THE CURRENT COIN OF THE REALM WAS DROSS IN COMPARISON WITH THE MUSICAL BANK COINAGE
THE LADIES GENERALLY WENT ALONE AS INDEED WAS THE CASE IN MOST FAMILIES EXCEPT ON STATE OCCASIONS I HAD LONG WANTED TO KNOW MORE OF THIS STRANGE SYSTEM
BUT I WOULD NOT ALLOW THE BALLOON TO DESCEND A SINGLE INCH NOT KNOWING FOR HOW LONG WE MIGHT NOT NEED ALL THE BUOYANCY WHICH WE COULD COMMAND INDEED I WAS THANKFUL TO FIND THAT AFTER NEARLY FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS WE WERE STILL AT SO GREAT A HEIGHT ABOVE THE EARTH
THEY KEEP THEIR OPINIONS HOWEVER GREATLY TO THEMSELVES INASMUCH AS MOST OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THE GODS AND THEY HOLD IT WRONG TO GIVE PAIN UNLESS FOR SOME GREATER GOOD THAN SEEMS LIKELY TO ARISE FROM THEIR PLAIN SPEAKING
CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE MUSICAL BANKS ON MY RETURN TO THE DRAWING ROOM I FOUND THAT THE MAHAINA CURRENT HAD EXPENDED ITSELF THE LADIES WERE JUST PUTTING AWAY THEIR WORK AND PREPARING TO GO OUT
NEITHER WOULD HE BE SO BY THAT OF THE GODS WHOM HE HAD NOT SEEN AT ONE TIME INDEED I CAME UPON A SMALL BUT GROWING SECT WHO BELIEVED AFTER A FASHION IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL AND THE RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD
AND ALSO THAT THE KING MIGHT CHANGE HIS MIND BUT THE WEATHER CONTINUED DRY AND IN ANOTHER WEEK THE QUEEN'S WORKMEN HAD FINISHED THE BALLOON AND CAR WHILE THE GAS WAS READY TO BE TURNED ON INTO THE BALLOON AT ANY MOMENT ALL BEING NOW PREPARED I WAS TO ASCEND ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
BUT I WAS HALF HOPEFUL THAT WE MIGHT BE ABOVE THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH I HAD ORIGINALLY STARTED I LOOKED ANXIOUSLY FOR ANY SIGN BY WHICH I COULD RECOGNISE IT BUT COULD SEE NOTHING AND FEARED THAT WE MIGHT BE ABOVE SOME DISTANT PART OF EREWHON OR A COUNTRY INHABITED BY SAVAGES
BUT A LARGE QUANTITY OF OILED SILK A CAR
FEW PEOPLE WOULD SPEAK QUITE OPENLY AND FREELY BEFORE THEM WHICH STRUCK ME AS A VERY BAD SIGN
I ARRANGED THE BALLAST ABOUT HER SO THAT IT SHOULD CONCEAL HER AS SHE LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR AND COVERED HER WITH WRAPPINGS ALTHOUGH IT STILL WANTED SOME HOURS OF THE TIME FIXED FOR MY ASCENT I COULD NOT TRUST MYSELF ONE MOMENT FROM THE CAR
MOREOVER THE DECEIT SERIOUS THOUGH IT WAS WILL PROBABLY LEAD TO THE CONVERSION OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY WHEN THE QUEEN TOLD HIS MAJESTY OF MY PROPOSAL HE AT FIRST NOT ONLY RIDICULED IT BUT WAS INCLINED TO VETO IT
IT WOULD LEAD PEOPLE TO CHEAPEN THIS PRESENT LIFE MAKING IT APPEAR TO BE AN AFFAIR OF ONLY SECONDARY IMPORTANCE THAT IT WOULD THUS DISTRACT MEN'S MINDS FROM THE PERFECTING OF THIS WORLD'S ECONOMY AND WAS AN IMPATIENT CUTTING SO TO SPEAK OF THE GORDIAN KNOT OF LIFE'S PROBLEMS
WITH THE OPTION OF A FINE OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE MONEY YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY THE PRISONER THANKED THE JUDGE AND SAID THAT AS HE HAD NO ONE TO LOOK AFTER HIS CHILDREN IF HE WAS SENT TO PRISON HE WOULD EMBRACE THE OPTION MERCIFULLY PERMITTED HIM BY HIS LORDSHIP
I SAW THE SEA AND NOTHING BUT THE SEA IN THE MAIN BLACK BUT FLECKED WITH WHITE HEADS OF STORM TOSSED ANGRY WAVES AROWHENA WAS SLEEPING QUIETLY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR AND AS I LOOKED AT HER SWEET AND SAINTLY BEAUTY I GROANED
THAT SOME ONE OF THEIR SONS PERHAPS A MERE CHILD SHOULD FILL IT THERE WAS THE LAD HIMSELF GROWING UP WITH EVERY PROMISE OF BECOMING A GOOD AND HONOURABLE MAN BUT UTTERLY WITHOUT WARNING CONCERNING THE IRON SHOE WHICH HIS NATURAL PROTECTOR WAS PROVIDING FOR HIM
SHE SAT BEHIND THE STOVE ON THE BEDSHELF AND PRETENDED TO CATCH A FAT FOUR YEAR OLD BOY WHO RAN BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN FRONT OF HER LAUGHING GAILY THIS BOY HAD ONLY A LITTLE SHIRT ON AND HIS HAIR WAS CUT SHORT
WITH A LOOK AT NEKHLUDOFF BUT HE SPOKE SO BADLY THAT NO ONE COULD MAKE ANYTHING OF IT NEKHLUDOFF SAID STILL MORE ASTONISHED THE FELLOW'S QUITE A FOOL AND OF COURSE COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO SAY ANYTHING SENSIBLE
A WEEK AGO HE HAD WRITTEN HER A DECISIVE LETTER IN WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS GUILT AND HIS READINESS TO ATONE FOR IT
YES BUT WE OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT OURSELVES IT WAS OUR MISTAKE AND NOW THE FOURTH POINT THE ADVOCATE CONTINUED THE FORM OF THE ANSWER GIVEN BY THE JURY CONTAINED AN EVIDENT CONTRADICTION
AS THE FACT THAT IT GAVE HER A CHANCE OF FORGETTING THE MISERY SHE SUFFERED
FINDING THAT HER CRY WAS ALSO TAKEN AS SOMETHING NATURAL AND EXPECTED AND FEELING INCAPABLE OF ALTERING MATTERS SHE WAS HORROR STRUCK AND BEGAN TO WEEP IN DESPAIR
FROM INSIDE THE CELL CAME THE SOUND OF BUSTLE AND WOMEN'S VOICES AND THE PATTER OF BARE FEET ON THE FLOOR
THAT JUSTICE FORBIDS PRIVATE LANDHOLDING AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD RESOLUTENESS OF HIS AGE HAD NOT MERELY SPOKEN TO PROVE THAT LAND COULD NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND WRITTEN ESSAYS ON THAT SUBJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY
HE COULD NOT PROPOSE AT ONCE IT WAS NOT THAT TEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BETRAYED AND FORSAKEN MASLOVA HE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THAT AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED IT A REASON FOR NOT MARRYING NO THE REASON WAS
AGAINST MARRIAGE IN GENERAL WAS THE FEAR COMMON TO BACHELORS PAST THEIR FIRST YOUTH OF LOSING FREEDOM AND AN UNCONSCIOUS AWE BEFORE THIS MYSTERIOUS CREATURE A WOMAN
FANARIN SAID LAUGHING BUT ALL THE SAME IT WILL DO AS A REASON FOR APPEAL THIRDLY THE PRESIDENT IN HIS SUMMING UP
AND SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE
SHE WAS SERVING HER TERM OF IMPRISONMENT FOR ILLICIT SALE OF SPIRITS SHE STOOD A LITTLE FURTHER FROM THE WINDOW KNITTING A STOCKING AND THOUGH SHE LISTENED TO THE OTHER PRISONERS WORDS SHE SHOOK HER HEAD DISAPPROVINGLY FROWNED
THE TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES SOON WENT SOME SHE PAID TO HER AUNT FOR BOARD AND LODGING THE REST WAS SPENT ON A HAT RIBBONS AND SUCH LIKE A FEW DAYS LATER THE AUTHOR SENT FOR HER AND SHE WENT
AND SPENT ALL HE COULD LAY HANDS ON AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE
OR IF THIS IS INCONVENIENT M FANARIN CAN IF HE GETS A POWER OF ATTORNEY FROM HER OH NO I SHALL TAKE THE PETITION TO HER AND GET HER TO SIGN IT SAID NEKHLUDOFF
THE WOMAN RECEIVED HER VERY KINDLY SET CAKE AND SWEET WINE BEFORE HER THEN WROTE A NOTE AND GAVE IT TO A SERVANT TO TAKE TO SOMEBODY IN THE EVENING A TALL MAN WITH LONG GREY HAIR AND A WHITE BEARD
WHO STOOD WASHING OR IRONING WITH THEIR THIN ARMS IN THE FEARFULLY HOT FRONT ROOM
SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN IN MARRIAGE WITHOUT HER CONSENT AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN BECAUSE HER HUSBAND WOULD GIVE HER NO PEACE BUT IN THE EIGHT MONTHS DURING WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LET OUT ON BAIL SHE HAD NOT ONLY MADE IT UP WITH HER HUSBAND BUT COME TO LOVE HIM
THEY DESCENDED THE STONE STAIRS
HE LOOKED AT THE LUXURIOUS FITTINGS OF THE STUDIO WITH A HEAVY HEART AND IT WAS IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD THAT HE ENTERED HIS STUDY A LARGE LOFTY ROOM FITTED UP WITH A VIEW TO COMFORT CONVENIENCE AND ELEGANT APPEARANCE
ALL SORTS OF STRANGE FURS WHICH NO ONE EVER USED AND VARIOUS UNIFORMS WERE TAKEN OUT AND HUNG ON A LINE THEN THE CARPETS AND FURNITURE WERE BROUGHT OUT AND THE GATE KEEPER AND THE BOY ROLLED THEIR SLEEVES UP THEIR MUSCULAR ARMS
SLOWLY LETTING THE HURRYING VISITORS PASS BEFORE AND EXPERIENCING A MINGLED FEELING OF HORROR AT THE EVIL DOERS LOCKED UP IN THIS BUILDING COMPASSION FOR THOSE WHO LIKE KATUSHA AND THE BOY THEY TRIED THE DAY BEFORE MUST BE HERE THOUGH GUILTLESS
THAT HE HAD A LIAISON WITH A MARRIED WOMAN AND THOUGH HE CONSIDERED IT BROKEN OFF SHE DID NOT NEKHLUDOFF WAS RATHER SHY WITH WOMEN AND HIS VERY SHYNESS AWAKENED IN THIS MARRIED WOMAN
AT THE IMPORTANT DEBATES CONCERNING THE SCHOOLS AND THE ROADS AS A STRONG OPPOSITION BY THE REACTIONARY PARTY WAS EXPECTED THE MARECHAL WAS A LIBERAL AND WAS QUITE ENGROSSED IN THIS FIGHT
WHO HAD SEEN MASLOVA OFF IN THE MORNING SHE WAS A TALL STRONG GLOOMY LOOKING WOMAN HER FAIR HAIR WHICH HAD BEGUN TO TURN GREY ON THE TEMPLES HUNG DOWN IN A SHORT PLAIT
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE
SOME EVEN RAN AT THE DOOR THERE STOOD A WARDER WHO COUNTED THE VISITORS AS THEY CAME IN SAYING ALOUD SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND SO ON
AND WITH HIS HEAD SHAVED BEYOND HER WAS THE DOORKEEPER WHO HAD SPOKEN TO NEKHLUDOFF OUTSIDE HE WAS SHOUTING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO A GREYHAIRED CONVICT ON THE OTHER SIDE
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO JOIN HIS REGIMENT
THAT HE AND NEKHLUDOFF BELONGED TO ONE AND THE SAME CAMP WHILE HIS OTHER CLIENTS BELONGED TO ANOTHER HE HAS WORRIED ME TO DEATH A FEARFUL SCOUNDREL I FELT I MUST RELIEVE MY FEELINGS SAID THE ADVOCATE
THE FACT OF HIS SPEAKING ENGLISH FRENCH AND GERMAN WITH A GOOD ACCENT
STILL HE CONTINUED WE CAN BUT TRY TO GET THE SENTENCE REVOKED THIS IS WHAT I HAVE NOTED DOWN HE TOOK UP SEVERAL SHEETS OF PAPER COVERED WITH WRITING AND BEGAN TO READ RAPIDLY
BUT SEEING WHAT A LIFE OF MISERY AND HARDSHIP HER AUNT'S ASSISTANTS LED KATUSHA HESITATED AND APPLIED TO A REGISTRY OFFICE
REFERRED TO THE CAUSES OF HER FALL HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE PRESIDENT CALLING HIM TO ORDER FOR THE ALLEGED DEVIATION FROM THE DIRECT SUBJECT YET AS HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY POINTED OUT BY THE SENATE THE ELUCIDATION OF THE CRIMINAL'S CHARACTERISTICS
AND HE TAKING IT AS HIS DUE AS HE ALWAYS DID WHEN AMONG STRANGERS HAD HE BEEN ASKED WHY HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ABOVE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HE COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN AN ANSWER
THE KIND MERRY EVER SMILING THEODOSIA HAD A PLACE NEXT MASLOVA'S ON THE SHELF BED AND HAD GROWN SO FOND OF HER THAT SHE TOOK IT UPON HERSELF AS A DUTY TO ATTEND AND WAIT ON HER
NEXT TO NEKHLUDOFF STOOD A CLEAN SHAVEN STOUT AND RED CHEEKED MAN HOLDING A BUNDLE APPARENTLY CONTAINING UNDER GARMENTS THIS WAS THE DOORKEEPER OF A BANK HE HAD COME TO SEE HIS BROTHER
AND THE BRILLIANT CORROBORATION OF WHICH HE HAD AT A LATER PERIOD FOUND IN THE WORKS OF HENRY GEORGE
PUTREFACTION AND TAR EVERY NEWCOMER FELT SAD AND DEJECTED IN IT THE WOMAN WARDER FELT THIS THOUGH SHE WAS USED TO BAD AIR SHE HAD JUST COME IN FROM OUTSIDE
AND DROVE HER TO THE NOTORIOUS HOUSE KEPT BY CAROLINA ALBERTOVNA KITAEVA FROM THAT DAY A LIFE OF CHRONIC SIN AGAINST HUMAN AND DIVINE LAWS COMMENCED FOR KATUSHA MASLOVA
THIS TOO DEPENDS ON THE PRIVATE INFLUENCE YOU CAN BRING TO WORK IN THIS CASE TOO I AM AT YOUR SERVICE I MEAN AS TO THE WORKING OF THE PETITION NOT THE INFLUENCE THANK YOU
APPEARED IN STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE DULL PALLOR OF HER FACE SHE CARRIED HERSELF VERY STRAIGHT EXPANDING HER FULL BOSOM WITH HER HEAD SLIGHTLY THROWN BACK
AND THE SHOPMAN AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD INJURED HER
IT WAS THEN SHE RECEIVED THE UNEXPECTED SENTENCE AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD MADE A MISTAKE SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE HERSELF AS A CONVICT IN SIBERIA AND COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT SHE HEARD BUT SEEING THE QUIET
MASLOVA'S MOTHER WAS THE UNMARRIED DAUGHTER OF A VILLAGE WOMAN
NOW AS TO YOUR FEES MY ASSISTANT WILL HAND YOU THE PETITION AND TELL YOU ONE THING MORE THE PROCUREUR GAVE ME A PASS FOR VISITING THIS PERSON IN PRISON
AND CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE MAJORITY OF THE VISITORS AND SO GOT INTO THE MEN'S PART OF THE PRISON INSTEAD OF THE WOMEN'S LETTING THE HURRYING VISITORS PASS BEFORE HIM HE WAS THE LAST TO GET INTO THE INTERVIEWING ROOM
THIS NOTE WAS A CONTINUATION OF THAT SKILFUL MANOEUVRING WHICH THE PRINCESS KORCHAGIN HAD ALREADY PRACTISED FOR TWO MONTHS IN ORDER TO BIND HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER WITH INVISIBLE THREADS AND YET
BELEASE TO GIFF IT ACCURATELY SAID CAROLINA ALBERTOVNA KITAEVA THE ATTENDANT WAS HURT BY HER WANT OF CONFIDENCE AND THAT WAS WHY HE TREATED MASLOVA SO BRUSQUELY MASLOVA WAS GLAD OF THE MONEY
AND HAD LOOKED DOWN WITH SOME DISDAIN AT ALL OTHER ACTIVITY FROM THE HEIGHT OF HIS ARTISTIC STANDPOINT AND NOW IT TURNED OUT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT REMINDED HIM OF ALL THIS WAS UNPLEASANT
NOT IN THE LEAST ABASHED BY THE SENTINEL'S WORDS AND TURNED BACK WELL IF YOU'LL NOT LET ME IN I'LL WAIT BUT NO MUST NEEDS SHOUT AS IF HE WERE A GENERAL THE CROWD LAUGHED APPROVINGLY
MISSY WHEN NEKHLUDOFF HAD FINISHED HIS COFFEE HE WENT TO HIS STUDY TO LOOK AT THE SUMMONS AND FIND OUT WHAT TIME HE WAS TO APPEAR AT THE COURT BEFORE WRITING HIS ANSWER TO THE PRINCESS PASSING THROUGH HIS STUDIO
STOOD LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE CONVICTS DOWN IN THE YARD AND SOME SAT SEWING
SO DON'T YOU BOTHER ME I DON'T BOTHER YOU DO I
YES MY DEAR SIR THIS IS IT ONE OF US ON THE JURY ARE YOU ASKED THE MERCHANT WITH A MERRY WINK
PASSED HITHER AND THITHER PLAINTIFFS AND THOSE OF THE ACCUSED WHO WERE NOT GUARDED WANDERED SADLY ALONG THE WALLS OR SAT WAITING WHERE IS THE LAW COURT NEKHLUDOFF ASKED OF AN ATTENDANT
TO THE PEASANTS INHERITING HIS MOTHER'S LARGE ESTATES AND THUS BECOMING A LANDED PROPRIETOR HE HAD TO CHOOSE ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER TO GIVE UP HIS PROPERTY AS HE HAD GIVEN UP HIS FATHER'S LAND TEN YEARS BEFORE
HAD EVIDENTLY PARTAKEN OF SOME REFRESHMENTS AND A GLASS OF SOMETHING AND WAS IN MOST PLEASANT SPIRITS THE OTHER WAS A SHOPMAN OF JEWISH EXTRACTION THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PRICE OF WOOL WHEN NEKHLUDOFF CAME UP AND ASKED THEM IF THIS WAS THE JURYMEN'S ROOM
HIS VULGARITY IN SHORT AH HA YOU'RE ALSO TRAPPED THESE WERE THE WORDS ACCOMPANIED WITH BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER WITH WHICH PETER GERASIMOVITCH GREETED NEKHLUDOFF HAVE YOU NOT MANAGED TO GET OUT OF IT
AND DO OTHER LIGHT WORK AND SOMETIMES SHE SAT AND READ TO THE LADIES THOUGH SHE HAD MORE THAN ONE OFFER SHE WOULD NOT MARRY SHE FELT THAT LIFE AS THE WIFE OF ANY OF THE WORKING MEN WHO WERE COURTING HER
BOUGHT FROM THE MOST EXPENSIVE DEALERS IN THESE GOODS HE QUITE KNEW WOULD NOT SERVE AS A REASON FOR CLAIMING SUPERIORITY AT THE SAME TIME HE DID CLAIM SUPERIORITY AND ACCEPTED THE RESPECT PAID HIM AS HIS DUE
SAID THE ADVOCATE SITTING DOWN OPPOSITE NEKHLUDOFF AND TRYING TO CONCEAL A SMILE APPARENTLY STILL EXCITED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE ACCOMPLISHED TRANSACTION THANKS I HAVE COME ABOUT MASLOVA'S CASE YES YES DIRECTLY
WERE SEPARATED NOT BY ONE BUT BY TWO NETS REACHING FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING THE WIRE NETS WERE STRETCHED SEVEN FEET APART AND SOLDIERS WERE WALKING UP AND DOWN THE SPACE BETWEEN THEM
OR SILENTLY TO CONFESS THAT ALL HIS FORMER IDEAS WERE MISTAKEN AND FALSE HE COULD NOT CHOOSE THE FORMER BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS BUT THE LANDED ESTATES HE DID NOT CARE TO SERVE
AND ENTERED THE OFFICE WHERE TWO SOLDIERS WERE WAITING TO ESCORT HER
HE SAID YOU SAW THIS HERE FELLOW WHY HE HAS ABOUT TWELVE MILLION ROUBLES AND HE CANNOT SPEAK CORRECTLY AND IF HE CAN GET A TWENTY FIVE ROUBLE NOTE OUT OF YOU HE'LL HAVE IT IF HE'S TO WRENCH IT OUT WITH HIS TEETH
THE MARECHAL'S WIFE AND FINISH COMPLETELY WITH HER I CAN DO NOTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND THE CONVICTION THAT HE MIGHT AND WAS EVEN OBLIGED TO DELAY HIS DECISION WAS COMFORTING WELL
NOT ONLY DID EVERYTHING REMAIN AS IT WAS BUT THE HOUSE WAS SUDDENLY FILLED WITH NEW ACTIVITY ALL THAT WAS MADE OF WOOL OR FUR WAS TAKEN OUT TO BE AIRED AND BEATEN THE GATE KEEPER THE BOY THE COOK AND CORNEY HIMSELF TOOK PART IN THIS ACTIVITY
HIS FIANCEE WISHED IT THIS LADY WAS HIS FIANCEE AND HER PARENTS HAD ADVISED THEM TO TAKE SOME ROLLS TO THE PRISONERS I MYSELF AM HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAID NEKHLUDOFF AND DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE NEKHLUDOFF HAD BEEN AN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRER OF HENRY GEORGE AND HERBERT SPENCER BEING HIMSELF HEIR TO A LARGE PROPERTY HE WAS ESPECIALLY STRUCK BY THE POSITION TAKEN UP BY SPENCER IN SOCIAL STATICS
AFTER NEKHLUDOFF HAD ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY NAME IS BAKLASHEFF MERCHANT OF THE SECOND GUILD HE SAID PUTTING OUT HIS BROAD SOFT FLEXIBLE HAND WITH WHOM HAVE I THE HONOUR
SINCE THE PROOFS OF WILFUL INTENT TO DEPRIVE SMELKOFF OF LIFE WERE ABSENT AND ONLY TO PRONOUNCE HER GUILTY OF CARELESSNESS RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF THE MERCHANT WHICH SHE DID NOT DESIRE THIS IS THE CHIEF POINT
AND CLOSED HER EYES BUT HER SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER STOOD IN HER LITTLE CHEMISE HER FLAXEN HAIR DONE UP IN A LITTLE PIGTAIL HER BLUE EYES FIXED AND HOLDING THE RED HAIRED WOMAN BY THE SKIRT
AND WAS HURT IF HE DID NOT GET IT IN THE JURYMEN'S ROOM HIS FEELINGS WERE HURT BY DISRESPECTFUL TREATMENT AMONG THE JURY THERE HAPPENED TO BE A MAN WHOM HE KNEW A FORMER TEACHER OF HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN PETER GERASIMOVITCH
SHE WAS ATTIRED IN THE MOST ORIGINAL MANNER SHE SEEMED ENVELOPED IN SOMETHING MADE OF VELVET AND SILK SOMETHING YELLOW AND GREEN AND HER THIN HAIR WAS CRIMPED SHE STEPPED OUT TRIUMPHANTLY INTO THE ANTE ROOM
AND CONSIDERING IT WRONG TO HOLD LANDED PROPERTY
THEIR FACES ALL HAD A CERTAIN LOOK OF SATISFACTION AT THE PROSPECT OF FULFILLING A PUBLIC DUTY ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM HAD HAD TO LEAVE THEIR BUSINESSES AND MOST WERE COMPLAINING OF IT THE JURYMEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES ABOUT THE WEATHER
THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO SPEAK SHE HAS RETURNED FROM THE LAW COURTS SIR SAID ONE OF THE SOLDIERS COMING FORWARD WITH HIS FINGERS LIFTED TO HIS CAP WELL HAND HER OVER TO THE CHIEF WARDER I WON'T HAVE THIS SORT OF THING YES SIR
HAVING REFRESHED HIS FULL WHITE MUSCULAR BODY AND DRIED IT WITH A ROUGH BATH SHEET HE PUT ON HIS FINE UNDERGARMENTS AND HIS BOOTS AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE GLASS TO BRUSH HIS BLACK BEARD AND HIS CURLY HAIR
AN AUNT OF THE LAD UNLAWFULLY TAKEN WAS THE FIRST TO CATCH HOLD OF THE BRIDLE OF THE HORSE ON WHICH HE WAS BEING CARRIED OFF THE OTHER WHO SAT DOING NOTHING WAS A KINDLY GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN HUNCHBACKED AND WITH A FLAT BOSOM
TRIMMED WITH BLACK VELVET WITH LOW NECK AND SHORT SLEEVES CONQUERED HER
LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE JAILER READY TO COMPLY WITH ANY ORDER THE JAILER WAS ABOUT TO LOCK THE DOOR
AND WOMEN WITH BRIGHT SILK KERCHIEFS ON THEIR HEADS AND CLOTH JACKETS TRIMMED WITH JET WERE ALREADY THRONGING AT THE DOOR OF THE TRAKTIR POLICEMEN WITH YELLOW CORDS TO THEIR UNIFORMS AND CARRYING PISTOLS WERE ON DUTY
AND THAT HE WAS HARDLY HER FIRST LOVE THIS LAST IDEA WAS PAINFUL TO HIM HIS PRIDE WOULD NOT RECONCILE ITSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD LOVED SOME ONE ELSE EVEN IN THE PAST
BUT DRY IN THE MIDDLE HEAVY CARTS RUMBLED UNCEASINGLY CABS RATTLED AND TRAMCARS PASSED RINGING BY
THE SIXTH BABY WHOSE FATHER WAS A GIPSY TRAMP WOULD HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE HAD IT NOT SO HAPPENED THAT ONE OF THE MAIDEN LADIES CAME INTO THE FARMYARD TO SCOLD THE DAIRYMAIDS FOR SENDING UP CREAM THAT SMELT OF THE COW
AND FARM ALL THE LAND NOW RENTED BY THE PEASANTS THEMSELVES THE STEWARD WROTE THAT THIS WOULD BE A FAR MORE PROFITABLE WAY OF MANAGING THE PROPERTY
FIVE CHILDREN HAD DIED IN THIS WAY
WHICH WAS COVERED WITH A FINE STARCHED CLOTH STOOD A SILVER COFFEEPOT FULL OF AROMATIC COFFEE A SUGAR BASIN A JUG OF FRESH CREAM AND A BREAD BASKET FILLED WITH FRESH ROLLS RUSKS AND BISCUITS
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT NEKHLUDOFF ASKED A LETTER FROM THE PRINCESS EITHER FROM THE MOTHER OR THE DAUGHTER THE MAID BROUGHT IT SOME TIME AGO AND IS WAITING IN MY ROOM
PASSING MASLOVA ALL THE CONVICTS LOOKED AT HER AND SOME CAME UP TO HER AND BRUSHED HER AS THEY PASSED
THEREFORE EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD HIM THIS UNDERSTANDING OF HIM
LIKE HIS OWN SYRUPS BUT BECAUSE THE WIDOW LOVED HIM BILL CONWAY WE HATED FOR HIMSELF LATE ONE DARK SATURDAY NIGHT IN SEPTEMBER WE CARRIED OUR PLAN INTO EFFECT
I AMONG THE NUMBER WITH THE RANK OF MAJOR WHO CARRIED THE GENERAL'S ORDERS AND LOOKED AFTER THE WOUNDED GENERAL MAT AMES A VETERAN COMMANDER WAS NO LESS WIDE AWAKE IN THE DISPOSITION OF HIS ARMY FIVE COMPANIES
I KNEW THEN WHAT HAD HAPPENED AS WELL AS I KNOW IT NOW BUT WHICH WAS IT FATHER OR MOTHER I DO NOT LIKE TO LOOK BACK TO THE AGONY AND SUSPENSE OF THAT MOMENT MY FATHER HAD DIED AT NEW ORLEANS DURING ONE OF HIS WEEKLY VISITS TO THE CITY
IRRESOLUTELY AND THEN COMMENCED READING IT ALOUD
GENTLY CHECKED MY RETREAT I WAS THEN CONDUCTED TO THE BRINK OF SEVERAL OTHER PRECIPICES AND ORDERED TO STEP OVER MANY DANGEROUS CHASMS WHERE THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTANT DEATH IF I HAD COMMITTED THE LEAST MISTAKE
CHAPTER TWELVE WINTER AT RIVERMOUTH
OUR MEETINGS WERE HELD IN VARIOUS BARNS AT NO STATED PERIODS BUT AS CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGESTED ANY MEMBER HAD A RIGHT TO CALL A MEETING EACH BOY WHO FAILED TO REPORT HIMSELF WAS FINED ONE CENT
HIS FEARS WERE BASED UPON THE FACT THAT I HAD PUBLISHED IN THE RIVERMOUTH BARNACLE SOME VERSES ADDRESSED IN A FAMILIAR MANNER TO THE MOON NOW THE IDEA OF A BOY WITH HIS LIVING TO GET
LAY BEHIND THE WALLS OF FORT SLATTER WITH THREE HUNDRED COMPACT SNOWBALLS PILED UP IN PYRAMIDS AWAITING THE APPROACH OF THE ENEMY THE ENEMY WAS NOT SLOW IN MAKING HIS APPROACH FIFTY STRONG
YANKEE DOODLE WHILE WE CHEERED AND JEERED THEM UNTIL THEY WERE OUT OF HEARING GENERAL AMES REMAINED BEHIND TO EFFECT AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS WE HELD THIRTEEN OF HIS MEN AND HE ELEVEN OF OURS
THE TRICK AS WAS AFTERWARDS PROVED HAD BEEN PLAYED BY A PARTY OF SOLDIERS STATIONED AT THE FORT IN THE HARBOR WE WERE INDEBTED FOR OUR ARREST TO MASTER CONWAY WHO HAD SLYLY DROPPED A HINT WITHIN THE HEARING OF SELECTMAN MUDGE TO THE EFFECT THAT
I WAS TO GO TO BOSTON WITH THE CAPTAIN TO MEET HER AND BRING HER HOME I NEED NOT DESCRIBE THAT MEETING WITH MY MOTHER'S HAND IN MINE ONCE MORE ALL THE LONG YEARS WE HAD BEEN PARTED APPEARED LIKE A DREAM
I MIGHT HAVE SHIELDED MYSELF BY APPEALING TO MISTER GRIMSHAW BUT NO BOY IN THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL COULD DO THAT WITHOUT LOSING CASTE WHETHER THIS WAS JUST OR NOT DOESN'T MATTER A PIN SINCE IT WAS SO A TRADITIONARY LAW OF THE PLACE
WE FORCED GENERAL AMES TO CAPITULATE
PROVED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE FIRST BLOW THAT WAS BAD FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID BINNY WALLACE HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK BAILEY DIDN'T FIGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE FOUGHT ON MY ACCOUNT AND IF YOU PLEASE SIR
WITH MIRTH FOR MANY A DAY AS TO MISS ABIGAIL I THINK SHE NEVER WHOLLY PARDONED HIM AFTER THIS CAPTAIN NUTTER GRADUALLY GAVE UP SMOKING WHICH IS AN UNTIDY INJURIOUS DISGRACEFUL AND HIGHLY PLEASANT HABIT
BUT I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHO PUT MEEKS'S MORTAR OVER OUR DOOR AND I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO DID IT IT WAS THAT SNEAKING LITTLE MULATTER POINTING AT ME O BY GEORGE I CRIED REDDENING AT THE INSULT
WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW I REFLECTED AS THE MONKEY SAID WHEN HE FELL OUT OF THE COCOANUT TREE ADDED CHARLEY MARDEN TRYING TO MAKE ME LAUGH IT WAS EARLY CANDLE LIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE
IF THERE IS ANY FIGHTING TO BE DONE I AM THE PERSON TO BE CONSULTED I DISAPPROVE OF BOYS FIGHTING IT IS UNNECESSARY AND UNCHRISTIAN IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE I CONSIDER EVERY LARGE BOY IN THIS SCHOOL AT FAULT
AND HIS SUMMERS IN THE NUTTER HOUSE WHICH THREATENS TO PROVE A HARD NUT FOR THE DESTRUCTIVE GENTLEMAN WITH THE SCYTHE AND THE HOUR GLASS FOR THE SEAWARD GABLE HAS NOT YIELDED A CLAPBOARD TO THE EASTWIND THESE TWENTY YEARS
THE UNKNOWN VOICE THEN DIRECTED ME TO TAKE TEN STEPS FORWARD AND STOP AT THE WORD HALT I TOOK TEN STEPS AND HALTED STRICKEN MORTAL SAID A SECOND HUSKY VOICE MORE HUSKY IF POSSIBLE THAN THE FIRST
I HAD BEEN STANDING BY MY FATHER NEAR THE WHEEL HOUSE ALL THIS WHILE OBSERVING THINGS WITH THAT NICETY OF PERCEPTION WHICH BELONGS ONLY TO CHILDREN BUT NOW THE DEW BEGAN FALLING AND WE WENT BELOW TO HAVE SUPPER
IN A FORMER CHAPTER I ALLUDED TO MISS ABIGAIL'S MANAGING PROPENSITIES SHE HAD AFFECTED MANY CHANGES IN THE NUTTER HOUSE BEFORE I CAME THERE TO LIVE
THAT THE CENTIPEDES WERE TO STAND BY ONE ANOTHER ON ALL OCCASIONS THOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER THAT THEY DID BUT FURTHER THAN THIS WE HAD NO PURPOSE UNLESS IT WAS TO ACCOMPLISH AS A BODY THE SAME AMOUNT OF MISCHIEF WHICH WE WERE SURE TO DO AS INDIVIDUALS
I HAVE NEGLECTED TO SAY THAT MY MOVEMENTS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY DISMAL GROANS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GROTTO FINALLY I WAS LED UP A STEEP PLANK TO WHAT APPEARED TO ME AN INCALCULABLE HEIGHT
STRUCK THE MERCANTILE MIND AS MONSTROUS IT WAS NOT ONLY A BAD INVESTMENT IT WAS LUNACY WE ADOPTED UNCLE SNOW'S VIEWS SO FAR AS TO ACCEDE TO HIS PROPOSITION FORTHWITH
NOW THE FLOOR SEEMED TO RISE AND NOW IT SEEMED TO SINK UNDER ONE'S FEET LIKE A FEATHER BED THERE WERE NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN PASSENGERS ON BOARD INCLUDING OURSELVES AND ALL OF THESE EXCEPTING A BALD HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN A RETIRED SEA CAPTAIN
THE DECISION ONCE MADE IT WAS UNCLE SNOW'S WISH THAT I SHOULD ENTER HIS COUNTING HOUSE IMMEDIATELY THE CAUSE OF MY GOOD UNCLE'S HASTE WAS THIS HE WAS AFRAID THAT I WOULD TURN OUT TO BE A POET BEFORE HE COULD MAKE A MERCHANT OF ME
I FOUND HIM IN THE FORECASTLE A SORT OF CELLAR IN THE FRONT PART OF THE VESSEL HE WAS AN AGREEABLE SAILOR AS I HAD EXPECTED AND WE BECAME THE BEST OF FRIENDS IN FIVE MINUTES HE HAD BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD TWO OR THREE TIMES AND KNEW NO END OF STORIES
MATTERS GREW WORSE AND WORSE SEVEN NORTH ENDERS HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND A DOZEN SOUTH ENDERS WERE REPORTED ON THE SICK LIST THE SELECTMEN OF THE TOWN AWOKE TO THE FACT OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AND DETAILED A POSSE OF POLICE
THE ADMIRAL WAS LAID TO REST BESIDE KITTY IN THE OLD SOUTH BURYING GROUND WITH AN ANCHOR THAT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HIM NEATLY CARVED ON HIS HEADSTONE I AM SORRY THE FIRE HAS GONE OUT
IF HE SHOWED THE SLIGHTEST TERROR HE WAS CERTAIN TO BE TRICKED UNMERCIFULLY ONE OF OUR SUBSEQUENT DEVICES A HUMBLE INVENTION OF MY OWN WAS TO REQUEST THE BLINDFOLDED CANDIDATE TO PUT OUT HIS TONGUE WHEREUPON THE FIRST CENTIPEDE WOULD SAY
A SINGLE BALL FROM THE DEXTEROUS BAND OF GENERAL HARRIS TAKING GENERAL AMES IN THE VERY PIT OF HIS STOMACH A CHEER WENT UP FROM FORT SLATTER
BROKE A WAGON PATH THROUGH THE PRINCIPAL STREETS BUT THE FOOT PASSENGERS HAD A HARD TIME OF IT FLOUNDERING IN THE ARCTIC DRIFTS THE CAPTAIN AND I CUT A TUNNEL THREE FEET WIDE AND SIX FEET HIGH
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO EXEUNT OMNES WITH THE CLOSE OF MY SCHOOL DAYS AT RIVERMOUTH THIS MODEST CHRONICLE ENDS THE NEW LIFE UPON WHICH I ENTERED THE NEW FRIENDS AND FOES I ENCOUNTERED ON THE ROAD
WERE DETAINED IN SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING OUR MEMORIES WITH A PAGE OF MISTER ANDREWS'S PERPLEXING IRREGULAR VERBS BINNY WALLACE FINISHING HIS TASK FIRST WAS DISMISSED I FOLLOWED SHORTLY AFTER
ON EACH SIDE WERE DISABLED IT WAS NOT AN INFREQUENT OCCURRENCE FOR THE COMBATANTS TO HOLD UP A FLAG OF TRUCE WHILE THEY REMOVED SOME INSENSIBLE COMRADE
IF I ACCEPTED MY UNCLE'S OFFER I MIGHT HOPE TO WORK MY WAY TO INDEPENDENCE WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME IT WAS HARD TO GIVE UP THE LONG CHERISHED DREAM OF BEING A HARVARD BOY BUT I GAVE IT UP
IN ONE OF THE CHOLERA HOSPITAL WARDS AND THE DESMOULINS NEAR NEIGHBORS OF OURS HAD PURCHASED THE PRETTY STONE HOUSE AMONG THE ORANGE TREES HOW ALL THESE SIMPLE DETAILS INTERESTED ME WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER LEAVING RIVERMOUTH I CARRIED ON A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH PEPPER WHITCOMB BUT IT GRADUALLY DWINDLED DOWN TO A SINGLE LETTER A MONTH AND THEN TO NONE AT ALL
UPON WHICH THE SUN SHIMMERED FOR A MOMENT WAS NO BIGGER THAN THE TOP OF OLD AUNT CHLOE'S THIMBLE WHAT DO I REMEMBER NEXT THE GRAY SKY AND THE FRETFUL BLUE WATERS OF THE GULF THE STEAM TUG HAD LONG SINCE LET SLIP HER HAWSERS
BY THE INVETERATE HABIT SHE HAD CONTRACTED OF SWALLOWING UNKNOWN QUANTITIES OF HOT DROPS WHENEVER SHE FANCIED HERSELF OUT OF SORTS EIGHTY SEVEN EMPTY PHIALS WERE FOUND IN A BONNET BOX ON A SHELF IN HER BEDROOM CLOSET
MY MOTHER I NEGLECTED TO SAY WAS ALSO TO RESIDE IN NEW YORK I SHALL NOT DRAW A PICTURE OF PEPPER WHITCOMB'S DISGUST WHEN THE NEWS WAS IMPARTED TO HIM NOR ATTEMPT TO PAINT SAILOR BEN'S DISTRESS AT THE PROSPECT
HE'S A LAD OF NO ENTERPRISE WHATEVER IF HE DOESN'T MANAGE TO SKATE INTO AN EEL HOLE
BY THIS NATURAL PHENOMENON MY DELIGHT AND SURPRISE WERE AS BOUNDLESS AS IF THE HEAVY GRAY SKY HAD LET DOWN A SHOWER OF POND LILIES AND WHITE ROSES INSTEAD OF SNOW FLAKES
OUR STREET WAS A SIGHT TO BE SEEN OR RATHER IT WAS A SIGHT NOT TO BE SEEN FOR VERY LITTLE STREET WAS VISIBLE
THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE SUNNY MONTHS AND THEN THANKSGIVING
ONE BLEAK DECEMBER MORNING CASTING A PECULIARLY NAUTICAL GLANCE SKYWARD
TO ANSWER THE DEMANDS OF THE OUTRAGED LAWS CHARLEY MARDEN HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN A PILE OF GRAVEL BEHIND HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND LOOKED LIKE A RECENTLY EXHUMED MUMMY THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST EVIDENCE AGAINST US AND INDEED WE WERE WHOLLY INNOCENT OF THE OFFENCE
MISS ABIGAIL OPENING THE FRONT DOOR STARTED BACK AT MY HILARIOUS APPEARANCE I TRIED TO SMILE UPON HER SWEETLY BUT THE SMILE RIPPLING OVER MY SWOLLEN CHEEK AND DYING AWAY LIKE A SPENT WAVE ON MY NOSE
BUT IN WINTER THE CAPTAIN WAS HARD PUT TO IT WHEN HE COULDN'T STAND IT LONGER HE RETREATED TO HIS BEDROOM AND BARRICADED THE DOOR SUCH WAS THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS AT THE TIME OF WHICH I WRITE
TO PREVENT FURTHER DISTURBANCE THE BOYS AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL SOUTH ENDERS AS IT HAPPENED FINDING THEMSELVES ASSAILED IN THE REAR AND ON THE FLANK TURNED ROUND AND ATTEMPTED TO BEAT OFF THE WATCHMEN
GENERAL AMES PROPOSED TO CALL IT AN EVEN THING SINCE MANY OF HIS ELEVEN PRISONERS WERE OFFICERS WHILE NEARLY ALL OUR THIRTEEN CAPTIVES WERE PRIVATES A DISPUTE ARISING ON THIS POINT
HEAVILY ON THE HAT RACK THE TONE OF REPROACH WITH WHICH THIS WORD WAS UTTERED FAILED TO PRODUCE THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT ON THE CAPTAIN WHO MERELY REMOVED THE PIPE FROM HIS LIPS FOR AN INSTANT AND
EVERYTHING WAS CHANGED WITH US NOW THERE WERE CONSULTATIONS WITH LAWYERS AND SIGNING OF PAPERS AND CORRESPONDENCE FOR MY FATHER'S AFFAIRS HAD BEEN LEFT IN GREAT CONFUSION
HE REACHED FORWARD ONE OF HIS LONG ARMS HE HAD ARMS LIKE A WINDMILL THAT BOY AND GRASPING ME BY THE HAIR TORE OUT QUITE A RESPECTABLE HANDFUL THE TEARS FLEW TO MY EYES
I DISCOVERED THAT SAILOR BEN AS HE WISHED ME TO CALL HIM WAS A PERFECT WALKING PICTUREBOOK HE HAD TWO ANCHORS A STAR AND A FRIGATE IN FULL SAIL ON HIS RIGHT ARM A PAIR OF LOVELY BLUE HANDS CLASPED ON HIS BREAST
THE INITIATION CEREMONY TOOK PLACE IN FRED LANGDON'S BARN WHERE I WAS SUBMITTED TO A SERIES OF TRIALS NOT CALCULATED TO SOOTHE THE NERVES OF A TIMOROUS BOY BEFORE BEING LED TO THE GROTTO OF ENCHANTMENT
THE EVENINGS WERE NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO HEAR ALL MY MOTHER HAD TO TELL OF THE SCENES SHE HAD PASSED THROUGH IN THE ILL FATED CITY THEN THERE WERE OLD TIMES TO TALK OVER FULL OF REMINISCENCES OF AUNT CHLOE AND LITTLE BLACK SAM
PRETTY CERTAIN TO SET IN BEFORE NOON ONCE HE CAUSED A PROTRACTED DROUGHT BY ASSURING US EVERY MORNING FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE WEEKS
THAT I HAD MY CURIOSITY ROUSED TO THE HIGHEST PITCH BY A SIGHT OF THESE SINGULAR EMBLEMS AS SOON AS I ASCERTAINED THE EXISTENCE OF A BOYS CLUB OF COURSE I WAS READY TO DIE TO JOIN IT AND EVENTUALLY I WAS ALLOWED TO JOIN
THESE WERE THE DERISIVE SUB TITLES BESTOWED ON OUR SOUTH END FOES INTENDED TO ATTACK THE FORT THAT SATURDAY AFTERNOON AT TWO O'CLOCK ALL THE FIGHTING BOYS OF THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND AS MANY RECRUITS AS WE COULD MUSTER
I FELT THAT I WAS NOT ONLY FOLLOWING MY NOSE BUT FOLLOWING IT SO CLOSELY THAT I WAS IN SOME DANGER OF TREADING ON IT I SEEMED TO HAVE NOSE ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE PARTY MY LEFT CHEEK ALSO WAS PUFFED OUT LIKE A DUMPLING
AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT OTHER PARTS OF HIS BODY WERE ILLUSTRATED IN THE SAME AGREEABLE MANNER I IMAGINE HE WAS FOND OF DRAWINGS AND TOOK THIS MEANS OF GRATIFYING HIS ARTISTIC TASTE IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY INGENIOUS AND CONVENIENT A PORTFOLIO MIGHT BE MISPLACED OR DROPPED OVERBOARD
IN ONE OF THE ONSETS A MAN NAMED MUGRIDGE MORE VALOROUS THAN HIS PEERS THREW HIMSELF UPON THE PARAPET WHEN HE WAS SEIZED BY TWENTY PAIRS OF HANDS AND DRAGGED INSIDE THE BREASTWORK WHERE FIFTEEN BOYS SAT DOWN ON HIM TO KEEP HIM QUIET
THE OCCASION MAY COME ROUND WHEN A DECENT PROFICIENCY IN ONE OR THE REST OF THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WILL BE OF SERVICE TO YOU IN ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS
ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE MUST HAVE BEEN SHIPWRECKED AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR EVER SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAD SERVED UNDER DECATUR WHEN THAT GALLANT OFFICER PEPPERED THE ALGERINES AND MADE THEM PROMISE NOT TO SELL THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR INTO SLAVERY HE HAD WORKED A GUN AT THE BOMBARDMENT OF VERA CRUZ IN THE MEXICAN WAR
I AM GLAD THAT I FACED CONWAY AND ASKED NO FAVORS AND GOT RID OF HIM FOREVER I AM GLAD THAT PHIL ADAMS TAUGHT ME TO BOX AND I SAY TO ALL YOUNGSTERS LEARN TO BOX TO RIDE TO PULL AN OAR AND TO SWIM
BUT THE INTERMISSION PASSED OFF TRANQUILLY SOMEWHAT TO OUR DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE CLOSE OF THE AFTERNOON SESSION IT HAPPENED THAT BINNY WALLACE AND MYSELF HAVING GOT SWAMPED IN OUR LATIN EXERCISE
IT WAS ALSO WELL KNOWN THAT THE WIDOW CONWAY HAD NOT BURIED HER HEART WITH THE LATE LAMENTED AS TO HER SHYNESS THAT WAS NOT SO CLEAR INDEED HER ATTENTIONS TO MISTER MEEKS WHOSE MOTHER SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
I HAD STIPULATED ON THIS DISPOSAL OF HER AND WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT ON HER TRAVELS SHE DID NOT DISAPPOINT MY GLOWING ANTICIPATIONS BUT BECAME QUITE A CELEBRITY IN HER WAY BY DANCING THE POLKA TO SLOW MUSIC
FROM OUR FRONT DOOR TO THE SIDEWALK OPPOSITE IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CAVERN WITH ITS WALLS AND ROOF INLAID WITH MOTHER OF PEARL AND DIAMONDS I AM SURE THE ICE PALACE OF THE RUSSIAN EMPRESS
OF GENERAL HARRIS'S STAFF WHITCOMB WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE SHOTS ON OUR SIDE THOUGH HE WAS NOT MUCH TO BOAST OF IN A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHT OWING TO THE WEAKNESS BEFORE MENTIONED GENERAL AMES PUT HIM AMONG THE GUNNERS
HEADED BY ONE MAT AMES OUR FORCES WERE UNDER THE COMMAND OF GENERAL J HARRIS BEFORE THE ACTION COMMENCED
AND WE WERE QUICKLY MADE AWARE OF THE LOSS WE HAD SUSTAINED BY RECEIVING A FREQUENT ARTFUL BALL WHICH SEEMED TO LIGHT WITH UNERRING INSTINCT ON ANY NOSE THAT WAS THE LEAST BIT EXPOSED
AND THERE WE WERE GLARING AT EACH OTHER MOTIONLESS NEITHER OF US DISPOSED TO RISK AN ATTACK BUT BOTH ON THE ALERT TO RESIST ONE THERE IS NO TELLING HOW LONG WE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN THAT ABSURD POSITION HAD WE NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED
THE LETTER BEARING THESE TIDINGS HAD REACHED RIVERMOUTH THE EVENING OF MY FLIGHT HAD PASSED ME ON THE ROAD BY THE DOWN TRAIN I MUST TURN BACK FOR A MOMENT TO THAT EVENTFUL EVENING
THE DISTRACTION WHICH PREVAILED IN THE CLASSES THE WEEK PRECEDING THE FOURTH HAD SUBSIDED AND NOTHING REMAINED TO INDICATE THE RECENT FESTIVITIES EXCEPTING A NOTICEABLE WANT OF EYEBROWS ON THE PART OF PEPPER WHITCOMB AND MYSELF
WHENEVER A MEMBER HAD REASONS FOR THINKING THAT ANOTHER MEMBER WOULD BE UNABLE TO ATTEND HE CALLED A MEETING FOR INSTANCE IMMEDIATELY ON LEARNING THE DEATH OF HARRY BLAKE'S GREAT GRANDFATHER I ISSUED A CALL
IT WAS A VERY DEEP SNOW THE OLDEST INHABITANT
SHORTLY BEFORE SUNSET AND WE HAD THE BITTEREST COLD NIGHT I EVER EXPERIENCED THIS BROUGHT OUT THE OLDEST INHABITANT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY AND WHAT A GAY OLD BOY HE WAS FOR DECIDING EVERYTHING
DID YOU SEE MISTER GRIMSHAW LOOKING OUT OF THE RECITATION ROOM WINDOW JUST AS WE LEFT THE YARD NO WAS HE THOUGH I AM SURE OF IT
I HAVE INDEED A VAGUE IMPRESSION THAT MY FATHER USED TO CLIMB UP TO THE BERTH AND CALL ME HIS ANCIENT MARINER BIDDING ME CHEER UP BUT THE ANCIENT MARINER WAS FAR FROM CHEERING UP IF I RECOLLECT RIGHTLY AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT VENERABLE NAVIGATOR WOULD HAVE CARED MUCH
A MONTH AFTER MY DEPARTURE FROM RIVERMOUTH THE CAPTAIN INFORMED ME BY LETTER THAT HE HAD PARTED WITH THE LITTLE MARE ACCORDING TO AGREEMENT SHE HAD BEEN SOLD TO THE RING MASTER OF A TRAVELLING CIRCUS
AFTER THIS BOTH SIDES NEVER FAILED TO FREEZE THEIR AMMUNITION IT WAS NO LONGER CHILD'S PLAY TO MARCH UP TO THE WALLS OF FORT SLATTER NOR WAS THE POSITION OF THE BESIEGED LESS PERILOUS AT EVERY ASSAULT THREE OR FOUR BOYS
AND BY SOME MYSTERIOUS AGENCY GOT INTO CANADA
THERE WAS A CERTAIN SLIM MILD APOTHECARY IN THE TOWN BY THE NAME OF MEEKS IT WAS GENERALLY GIVEN OUT THAT MISTER MEEKS HAD A VAGUE DESIRE TO GET MARRIED BUT BEING A SHY AND TIMOROUS YOUTH LACKED THE MORAL COURAGE TO DO SO
SOMEHOW NEVER TURNED OUT ACCORDING TO HIS PREDICTION THE VANES ON THE CHURCH STEEPLES SEEMED TO TAKE FIENDISH PLEASURE IN HUMILIATING THE DEAR OLD GENTLEMAN IF HE SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE A CLEAR DAY A DENSE SEA FOG WAS
