SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW HOW COULD I HELP IT JOHN WOULD HAVE ME GO FOR HE VOWED HE WOULD NOT DRIVE HER BECAUSE SHE HAD SUCH THICK ANKLES I DARE SAY SHE WILL NOT BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AGAIN THIS MONTH
BUT THE TILNEYS WERE ENTIRELY TO BLAME WHY WERE NOT THEY MORE PUNCTUAL IT WAS DIRTY INDEED BUT WHAT DID THAT SIGNIFY I AM SURE JOHN AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE MINDED IT I NEVER MIND GOING THROUGH ANYTHING WHERE A FRIEND IS CONCERNED THAT IS MY DISPOSITION
HER BROTHER SHE FOUND WAS PREPARING TO SET OFF WITH ALL SPEED TO FULLERTON TO MAKE KNOWN HIS SITUATION AND ASK CONSENT AND HERE WAS A SOURCE OF SOME REAL AGITATION TO THE MIND OF ISABELLA CATHERINE ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HER AS SHE WAS HERSELF PERSUADED THAT
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE LIKE ME I DARE SAY ONLY A GREAT DEAL BETTER GOOD MORNING TO YOU BUT I SAY MISS MORLAND I SHALL COME AND PAY MY RESPECTS AT FULLERTON BEFORE IT IS LONG IF NOT DISAGREEABLE PRAY DO
CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MORROW BROUGHT A VERY SOBER LOOKING MORNING THE SUN MAKING ONLY A FEW EFFORTS TO APPEAR AND CATHERINE AUGURED FROM IT EVERYTHING MOST FAVOURABLE TO HER WISHES
THOUGH RATHER THAN BE DISAPPOINTED OF THE PROMISED WALK AND ESPECIALLY RATHER THAN BE THOUGHT ILL OF BY THE TILNEYS SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN UP ALL THE HAPPINESS WHICH ITS WALLS COULD SUPPLY THE HAPPINESS OF A PROGRESS THROUGH A LONG SUITE OF LOFTY ROOMS
MY SWEET CATHERINE IN YOUR GENEROUS HEART I KNOW IT WOULD SIGNIFY NOTHING BUT WE MUST NOT EXPECT SUCH DISINTERESTEDNESS IN MANY AS FOR MYSELF I AM SURE I ONLY WISH OUR SITUATIONS WERE REVERSED HAD I THE COMMAND OF MILLIONS WERE I MISTRESS OF THE WHOLE WORLD YOUR BROTHER WOULD
SAID HE SOON AFTERWARDS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE IT VERY WELL
AND INQUIRED FOR HER A FEW MINUTES AFTER HER SETTING OFF THAT WHEN HE TOLD THEM SHE WAS GONE OUT WITH MISTER THORPE THE LADY HAD ASKED WHETHER ANY MESSAGE HAD BEEN LEFT FOR HER AND ON HIS SAYING NO HAD FELT FOR A CARD BUT SAID SHE HAD NONE ABOUT HER AND WENT AWAY
BUT I HAVE A NOTION MISS MORLAND YOU AND I THINK PRETTY MUCH ALIKE UPON MOST MATTERS PERHAPS WE MAY
HOW COULD YOU DECEIVE ME SO MISTER THORPE HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW THEM DRIVING UP THE LANSDOWN ROAD I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD IT HAPPEN SO FOR THE WORLD THEY MUST THINK IT SO STRANGE SO RUDE OF ME TO GO BY THEM TOO WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
IF I CAN BUT BE NEAR YOU I SHALL BE SATISFIED BUT THIS IS IDLE TALKING I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS TILL WE HAVE YOUR FATHER'S ANSWER MORLAND SAYS THAT BY SENDING IT TONIGHT TO SALISBURY WE MAY HAVE IT TOMORROW TOMORROW
OF WHICH THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LIFE CAN HARDLY AFFORD A RETURN THE STRENGTH OF HER FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT EXPRESS THE NATURE OF THEM HOWEVER CONTENTED HER FRIEND THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING SUCH A SISTER WAS THEIR FIRST EFFUSION
BUT SWORE OFF MANY SENTENCES IN HIS PRAISE THE LETTER WHENCE SPRANG ALL THIS FELICITY WAS SHORT CONTAINING LITTLE MORE THAN THIS ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS AND EVERY PARTICULAR WAS DEFERRED TILL JAMES COULD WRITE AGAIN
STILL HOWEVER AND DURING THE LENGTH OF ANOTHER STREET SHE ENTREATED HIM TO STOP PRAY PRAY STOP MISTER THORPE I CANNOT GO ON I WILL NOT GO ON I MUST GO BACK TO MISS TILNEY BUT MISTER THORPE ONLY LAUGHED SMACKED HIS WHIP
BUT I AM DETERMINED I WILL NOT BE CROSS IT IS NOT A LITTLE MATTER THAT PUTS ME OUT OF TEMPER ISABELLA NOW ENTERED THE ROOM WITH SO EAGER A STEP AND A LOOK OF SUCH HAPPY IMPORTANCE AS ENGAGED ALL HER FRIEND'S NOTICE
AND IT IS NOT ONLY GOOD NATURE BUT YOU HAVE SO MUCH SO MUCH OF EVERYTHING AND THEN YOU HAVE SUCH UPON MY SOUL I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY LIKE YOU OH
I DO NOT KNOW INDEED YES I KNOW HE DOES I SAW HIM YOU ARE TALKING OF THE MAN YOU DANCED WITH LAST NIGHT ARE NOT YOU YES WELL I SAW HIM AT THAT MOMENT TURN UP THE LANSDOWN ROAD DRIVING A SMART LOOKING GIRL
THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS MISSUS THORPE WITH TEARS OF JOY EMBRACED HER DAUGHTER HER SON HER VISITOR AND COULD HAVE EMBRACED HALF THE INHABITANTS OF BATH WITH SATISFACTION
IT IS ALL ONE TO ME REPLIED THORPE RATHER ANGRILY AND INSTANTLY TURNING HIS HORSE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO BATH
ISABELLA CORROBORATED IT MY DEAREST CATHERINE YOU CANNOT FORM AN IDEA OF THE DIRT COME YOU MUST GO YOU CANNOT REFUSE GOING NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CASTLE BUT MAY WE GO ALL OVER IT
WERE NOT MORE THAN THAT BELOVED CHILD HAD NOW WELL EARNED JOHN HIMSELF WAS NO SKULKER IN JOY
AND ALL THAT THEY FELT ON THE OCCASION WAS COMPREHENDED IN A WISH FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS WITH A REMARK ON THE GENTLEMAN'S SIDE IN FAVOUR OF ISABELLA'S BEAUTY
TWICE WAS HE CALLED ALMOST FROM THE DOOR BY HER EAGERNESS TO HAVE HIM GONE INDEED MORLAND I MUST DRIVE YOU AWAY CONSIDER HOW FAR YOU HAVE TO RIDE I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU LINGER SO FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE WASTE NO MORE TIME
ENCOURAGED HIS HORSE MADE ODD NOISES AND DROVE ON AND CATHERINE ANGRY AND VEXED AS SHE WAS HAVING NO POWER OF GETTING AWAY WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE POINT AND SUBMIT HER REPROACHES HOWEVER WERE NOT SPARED
AND I HAVE ALMOST BROKE MY ARM WITH PULLING HIM IN TO THAT CURSED BROKEN WINDED JADE'S PACE MORLAND IS A FOOL FOR NOT KEEPING A HORSE AND GIG OF HIS OWN NO HE IS NOT SAID CATHERINE WARMLY
THERE GO GO I INSIST ON IT THE TWO FRIENDS WITH HEARTS NOW MORE UNITED THAN EVER WERE INSEPARABLE FOR THE DAY AND IN SCHEMES OF SISTERLY HAPPINESS THE HOURS FLEW ALONG MISSUS THORPE AND HER SON
CONTAINING THE SAME THREE PEOPLE THAT HAD SURPRISED HER SO MUCH A FEW MORNINGS BACK ISABELLA MY BROTHER AND MISTER THORPE I DECLARE THEY ARE COMING FOR ME PERHAPS BUT I SHALL NOT GO I CANNOT GO INDEED
I HATE THE IDEA OF ONE GREAT FORTUNE LOOKING OUT FOR ANOTHER AND TO MARRY FOR MONEY I THINK THE WICKEDEST THING IN EXISTENCE GOOD DAY
HER HEART WAS OVERFLOWING WITH TENDERNESS IT WAS DEAR JOHN AND DEAR CATHERINE AT EVERY WORD DEAR ANNE AND DEAR MARIA MUST IMMEDIATELY BE MADE SHARERS IN THEIR FELICITY AND TWO DEARS AT ONCE BEFORE THE NAME OF ISABELLA
THE TWO YOUNGEST MISS THORPES WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE PARLOUR AND ON ANNE'S QUITTING IT TO CALL HER SISTER CATHERINE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING THE OTHER FOR SOME PARTICULARS OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY
I AM SURE THEY WILL CONSENT WAS HER FREQUENT DECLARATION I AM SURE THEY WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH YOU FOR MY OWN PART SAID ISABELLA MY WISHES ARE SO MODERATE THAT THE SMALLEST INCOME IN NATURE WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME
DECLARED HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO MEN SO MUCH ALIKE IN HIS LIFE AND WOULD HARDLY GIVE UP THE POINT OF ITS HAVING BEEN TILNEY HIMSELF THEIR DRIVE EVEN WHEN THIS SUBJECT WAS OVER WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY AGREEABLE
IT WILL BE SO DIRTY OH THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY I NEVER MIND DIRT NO REPLIED HER FRIEND VERY PLACIDLY I KNOW YOU NEVER MIND DIRT AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
AND NOW I MAY DISMISS MY HEROINE TO THE SLEEPLESS COUCH WHICH IS THE TRUE HEROINE'S PORTION TO A PILLOW STREWED WITH THORNS AND WET WITH TEARS
AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK HOWEVER A FEW SPECKS OF SMALL RAIN UPON THE WINDOWS CAUGHT CATHERINE'S WATCHFUL EYE AND OH DEAR I DO BELIEVE IT WILL BE WET BROKE FROM HER IN A MOST DESPONDING TONE
THAT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE HOW CHARMING IT HAD BEEN AND THAT IT HAD BEEN MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN ANYBODY COULD CONCEIVE SUCH WAS THE INFORMATION OF THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES THE SECOND UNFOLDED THUS MUCH IN DETAIL
TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF CURIOSITY
THERE ARE NOT MANY THAT I KNOW MY OWN MIND ABOUT BY JOVE NO MORE DO I
MY FATHER AND MOTHER WILL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AND I HOPE I HOPE MISS MORLAND YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY TO SEE ME OH DEAR NOT AT ALL
MARIA'S INTELLIGENCE CONCLUDED WITH A TENDER EFFUSION OF PITY FOR HER SISTER ANNE
CATHERINE'S COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LONGER WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN THEIR FORMER AIRING SHE LISTENED RELUCTANTLY AND HER REPLIES WERE SHORT BLAIZE CASTLE REMAINED HER ONLY COMFORT TOWARDS THAT SHE STILL LOOKED AT INTERVALS WITH PLEASURE
DO YOU THAT'S HONEST BY HEAVENS I AM GLAD YOU ARE NO ENEMY TO MATRIMONY HOWEVER DID YOU EVER HEAR THE OLD SONG GOING TO ONE WEDDING BRINGS ON ANOTHER
AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY WERE OFF CATHERINE'S FEELINGS AS SHE GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE
AND SO YOU GUESSED IT THE MOMENT YOU HAD MY NOTE SLY CREATURE OH MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU ALONE WHO KNOW MY HEART CAN JUDGE OF MY PRESENT HAPPINESS YOUR BROTHER IS THE MOST CHARMING OF MEN I ONLY WISH I WERE MORE WORTHY OF HIM
I DARE SAY IT WILL NOT BE A VERY GOOD BALL I KNOW THE MITCHELLS WILL NOT BE THERE I AM SURE I PITY EVERYBODY THAT IS BUT I DARE SAY MISTER MORLAND YOU LONG TO BE AT IT DO NOT YOU I AM SURE YOU DO
A VERY GOOD EQUIVALENT FOR THE QUIET AND COUNTRY AIR OF AN INN AT CLIFTON HER SATISFACTION TOO IN NOT BEING AT THE LOWER ROOMS WAS SPOKEN MORE THAN ONCE HOW I PITY THE POOR CREATURES THAT ARE GOING THERE
WHO IS THAT GIRL WHO LOOKED AT YOU SO HARD AS SHE WENT BY WHO WHERE ON THE RIGHT HAND PAVEMENT SHE MUST BE ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT NOW CATHERINE LOOKED ROUND AND SAW MISS TILNEY LEANING ON HER BROTHER'S ARM
WHAT IS IT REALLY A CASTLE AN OLD CASTLE THE OLDEST IN THE KINGDOM
THAT A BRIGHT AFTERNOON WOULD SUCCEED AND JUSTIFIED THE OPINION OF MISSUS ALLEN WHO HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD CLEAR UP BUT WHETHER CATHERINE MIGHT STILL EXPECT HER FRIENDS WHETHER THERE HAD NOT BEEN TOO MUCH RAIN FOR MISS TILNEY TO VENTURE MUST YET BE A QUESTION
IT WAS TO CATHERINE THE MOST SURPRISING INSENSIBILITY THE DISCLOSURE HOWEVER OF THE GREAT SECRET OF JAMES'S GOING TO FULLERTON THE DAY BEFORE DID RAISE SOME EMOTION IN MISSUS ALLEN SHE COULD NOT LISTEN TO THAT WITH PERFECT CALMNESS
I KNOW BUT I WILL NOT PAIN YOU BY DESCRIBING MY ANXIETY YOU HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF IT I FEEL THAT I HAVE BETRAYED MYSELF PERPETUALLY SO UNGUARDED IN SPEAKING OF MY PARTIALITY FOR THE CHURCH BUT MY SECRET I WAS ALWAYS SURE WOULD BE SAFE WITH YOU
I AM COME TO BID YOU GOOD BYE CATHERINE WISHED HIM A GOOD JOURNEY WITHOUT APPEARING TO HEAR HER HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW FIDGETED ABOUT HUMMED A TUNE AND SEEMED WHOLLY SELF OCCUPIED
MAKE YOURSELF EASY THERE IS NO DANGER OF THAT FOR I HEARD TILNEY HALLOOING TO A MAN WHO WAS JUST PASSING BY ON HORSEBACK THAT THEY WERE GOING AS FAR AS WICK ROCKS THEN I WILL SHALL I GO MISSUS ALLEN
YOU ARE TO THANK YOUR BROTHER AND ME FOR THE SCHEME IT DARTED INTO OUR HEADS AT BREAKFAST TIME I VERILY BELIEVE AT THE SAME INSTANT AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF TWO HOURS AGO IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS DETESTABLE RAIN BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE NIGHTS ARE MOONLIGHT AND WE SHALL DO DELIGHTFULLY
IT COMES ON FASTER AND FASTER SAID CATHERINE AS SHE STOOD WATCHING AT A WINDOW SO IT DOES INDEED IF IT KEEPS RAINING THE STREETS WILL BE VERY WET THERE ARE FOUR UMBRELLAS UP ALREADY HOW I HATE THE SIGHT OF AN UMBRELLA
AND AWAY SHE WENT IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF ALL HIS GALLANTRY TO DETAIN HER LONGER WITH SUCH NEWS TO COMMUNICATE AND SUCH A VISIT TO PREPARE FOR HER DEPARTURE WAS NOT TO BE DELAYED BY ANYTHING IN HIS NATURE TO URGE AND SHE HURRIED AWAY
WELL PRAY DO NOT LET ANYBODY HERE BE A RESTRAINT ON YOU I DARE SAY WE COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT YOU BUT YOU MEN THINK YOURSELVES OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE CATHERINE COULD ALMOST HAVE ACCUSED ISABELLA OF BEING WANTING IN TENDERNESS TOWARDS HERSELF AND HER SORROWS
BUT TO WHAT PURPOSE DID SHE SPEAK THORPE ONLY LASHED HIS HORSE INTO A BRISKER TROT THE TILNEYS WHO HAD SOON CEASED TO LOOK AFTER HER WERE IN A MOMENT OUT OF SIGHT ROUND THE CORNER OF LAURA PLACE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS HERSELF WHISKED INTO THE MARKETPLACE
AND A BRILLIANT EXHIBITION OF HOOP RINGS ON HER FINGER WHEN THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER WERE ASCERTAINED JOHN THORPE WHO HAD ONLY WAITED ITS ARRIVAL TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON PREPARED TO SET OFF WELL MISS MORLAND
BUT KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY AND HER ELOQUENCE WAS ONLY IN HER EYES FROM THEM HOWEVER THE EIGHT PARTS OF SPEECH SHONE OUT MOST EXPRESSIVELY
TO CATHERINE'S SIMPLE FEELINGS THIS ODD SORT OF RESERVE SEEMED NEITHER KINDLY MEANT NOR CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED AND ITS UNKINDNESS SHE WOULD HARDLY HAVE FORBORNE POINTING OUT HAD ITS INCONSISTENCY BEEN LESS THEIR FRIEND
A REVERIE SUCCEEDED THIS CONVICTION AND WHEN ISABELLA SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS TO RESOLVE ON THE QUALITY OF HER WEDDING GOWN THEIR CONFERENCE WAS PUT AN END TO BY THE ANXIOUS YOUNG LOVER HIMSELF WHO CAME TO BREATHE HIS PARTING SIGH BEFORE HE SET OFF FOR WILTSHIRE
THE ANXIOUS AFFECTION WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING CONTINUALLY WATCHED IN ISABELLA'S EVERY LOOK AND ACTION HAD IN THE COURSE OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY RECEIVED THE DELIGHTFUL CONFESSION OF AN EQUAL LOVE HER HEART AND FAITH WERE ALIKE ENGAGED TO JAMES
FOR YOU KNOW MISS TILNEY MAY STILL CALL MISSUS ALLEN AGREED TO IT JOHN THORPE WAS SOON WITH THEM AND HIS VOICE WAS WITH THEM YET SOONER FOR ON THE STAIRS HE WAS CALLING OUT TO MISS MORLAND TO BE QUICK MAKE HASTE MAKE HASTE AS HE THREW OPEN THE DOOR
THAT I QUITE DOTED ON YOU THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW YOU BUT SO IT ALWAYS IS WITH ME THE FIRST MOMENT SETTLES EVERYTHING THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT MORLAND CAME TO US LAST CHRISTMAS THE VERY FIRST MOMENT I BEHELD HIM MY HEART WAS IRRECOVERABLY GONE
THIS IS JUST THE TIME OF DAY FOR IT TO CLEAR UP AND I DO THINK IT LOOKS A LITTLE LIGHTER THERE IT IS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER TWELVE AND NOW I SHALL GIVE IT UP ENTIRELY OH THAT WE HAD SUCH WEATHER HERE AS THEY HAD AT UDOLPHO
YOU WILL BE SO INFINITELY DEARER TO ME MY CATHERINE THAN EITHER ANNE OR MARIA I FEEL THAT I SHALL BE SO MUCH MORE ATTACHED TO MY DEAR MORLAND'S FAMILY THAN TO MY OWN THIS WAS A PITCH OF FRIENDSHIP BEYOND CATHERINE
BEFORE THE DELIVERY OF THE LETTERS A NEEDFUL EXERTION FOR AS THE TIME OF REASONABLE EXPECTATION DREW NEAR ISABELLA BECAME MORE AND MORE DESPONDING AND BEFORE THE LETTER ARRIVED HAD WORKED HERSELF INTO A STATE OF REAL DISTRESS
SHE SAW HERSELF AT THE END OF A FEW WEEKS THE GAZE AND ADMIRATION OF EVERY NEW ACQUAINTANCE AT FULLERTON THE ENVY OF EVERY VALUED OLD FRIEND IN PUTNEY WITH A CARRIAGE AT HER COMMAND A NEW NAME ON HER TICKETS
MADE HIS FRIEND PULL UP TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER THE OTHERS THEN CAME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR CONVERSATION AND MORLAND SAID WE HAD BETTER GO BACK THORPE IT IS TOO LATE TO GO ON TODAY
WITH THE NATURAL BLUSH OF SO NEW AN EMOTION SHE CRIED OUT GOOD HEAVEN MY DEAR ISABELLA WHAT DO YOU MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU REALLY BE IN LOVE WITH JAMES THIS BOLD SURMISE HOWEVER SHE SOON LEARNT COMPREHENDED BUT HALF THE FACT
I DINE WITH MISS TILNEY TODAY AND MUST NOW BE GOING HOME NAY BUT THERE IS NO SUCH CONFOUNDED HURRY WHO KNOWS WHEN WE MAY BE TOGETHER AGAIN NOT BUT THAT I SHALL BE DOWN AGAIN BY THE END OF A FORTNIGHT
THE RAIN CONTINUED FAST THOUGH NOT HEAVY CATHERINE WENT EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO THE CLOCK THREATENING ON EACH RETURN THAT IF IT STILL KEPT ON RAINING ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES SHE WOULD GIVE UP THE MATTER AS HOPELESS
CATHERINE FELT THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN SAFER BUT ASHAMED OF AN IGNORANCE LITTLE EXPECTED SHE DARED NO LONGER CONTEST THE POINT NOR REFUSE TO HAVE BEEN AS FULL OF ARCH PENETRATION AND AFFECTIONATE SYMPATHY AS ISABELLA CHOSE TO CONSIDER HER
AS HER FANCY REPRESENTED BLAIZE CASTLE TO BE WAS SUCH A COUNTERPOISE OF GOOD AS MIGHT CONSOLE HER FOR ALMOST ANYTHING THEY PASSED BRISKLY DOWN PULTENEY STREET AND THROUGH LAURA PLACE WITHOUT THE EXCHANGE OF MANY WORDS
OR EVEN OF HAVING THEIR LAMP THEIR ONLY LAMP EXTINGUISHED BY A SUDDEN GUST OF WIND AND OF BEING LEFT IN TOTAL DARKNESS IN THE MEANWHILE THEY PROCEEDED ON THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT ANY MISCHANCE AND WERE WITHIN VIEW OF THE TOWN OF KEYNSHAM
EXHIBITING THE REMAINS OF MAGNIFICENT FURNITURE THOUGH NOW FOR MANY YEARS DESERTED THE HAPPINESS OF BEING STOPPED IN THEIR WAY ALONG NARROW WINDING VAULTS BY A LOW GRATED DOOR
THEY NEVER CAN CONSENT TO IT YOUR BROTHER WHO MIGHT MARRY ANYBODY HERE CATHERINE AGAIN DISCERNED THE FORCE OF LOVE INDEED ISABELLA YOU ARE TOO HUMBLE THE DIFFERENCE OF FORTUNE CAN BE NOTHING TO SIGNIFY OH
I DOUBT OUR BEING ABLE TO DO SO MUCH SAID MORLAND YOU CROAKING FELLOW CRIED THORPE WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO TEN TIMES MORE KINGSWESTON AYE AND BLAIZE CASTLE TOO AND ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN HEAR OF
IMPATIENT FOR THE REALIZATION OF ALL THAT HE HOPED AT HOME
THERE WILL BE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN THE PUMP ROOM IF IT RAINS ALL THE MORNING I HOPE MISTER ALLEN WILL PUT ON HIS GREATCOAT WHEN HE GOES BUT I DARE SAY HE WILL NOT FOR HE HAD RATHER DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD THAN WALK OUT IN A GREATCOAT I WONDER HE SHOULD DISLIKE IT IT MUST BE SO COMFORTABLE
AND IN ONE MOMENT ALL WAS JOYFUL SECURITY THE BRIGHTEST GLOW WAS INSTANTLY SPREAD OVER ISABELLA'S FEATURES ALL CARE AND ANXIETY SEEMED REMOVED HER SPIRITS BECAME ALMOST TOO HIGH FOR CONTROL AND SHE CALLED HERSELF WITHOUT SCRUPLE
IN SO READILY GIVING UP THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT SENDING HER ANY MESSAGE OF EXCUSE IT WAS NOW BUT AN HOUR LATER THAN THE TIME FIXED ON FOR THE BEGINNING OF THEIR WALK AND IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD OF THE PRODIGIOUS ACCUMULATION OF DIRT IN THE COURSE OF THAT HOUR
THORPE TALKED TO HIS HORSE AND SHE MEDITATED BY TURNS ON BROKEN PROMISES AND BROKEN ARCHES PHAETONS AND FALSE HANGINGS TILNEYS AND TRAP DOORS AS THEY ENTERED ARGYLE BUILDINGS HOWEVER SHE WAS ROUSED BY THIS ADDRESS FROM HER COMPANION
BUT WHEN IT DID COME WHERE COULD DISTRESS BE FOUND I HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GAINING THE CONSENT OF MY KIND PARENTS AND AM PROMISED THAT EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER SHALL BE DONE TO FORWARD MY HAPPINESS WERE THE FIRST THREE LINES
DECLINED GIVING ANY ABSOLUTE PROMISE OF SUNSHINE SHE APPLIED TO MISSUS ALLEN AND MISSUS ALLEN'S OPINION WAS MORE POSITIVE SHE HAD NO DOUBT IN THE WORLD OF ITS BEING A VERY FINE DAY IF THE CLOUDS WOULD ONLY GO OFF AND THE SUN KEEP OUT
DIVIDED BETWEEN REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF ONE GREAT PLEASURE AND THE HOPE OF SOON ENJOYING ANOTHER ALMOST ITS EQUAL IN DEGREE HOWEVER UNLIKE IN KIND SHE COULD NOT THINK THE TILNEYS HAD ACTED QUITE WELL BY HER
PONDERING OVER THESE HEART RENDING TIDINGS CATHERINE WALKED SLOWLY UPSTAIRS AT THE HEAD OF THEM SHE WAS MET BY MISTER ALLEN WHO ON HEARING THE REASON OF THEIR SPEEDY RETURN
OR AT LEAST IN TUSCANY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE THE NIGHT THAT POOR SAINT AUBIN DIED SUCH BEAUTIFUL WEATHER AT HALF PAST TWELVE WHEN CATHERINE'S ANXIOUS ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER WAS OVER AND SHE COULD NO LONGER CLAIM ANY MERIT FROM ITS AMENDMENT
I THOUGHT HOW IT WOULD BE SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WALK FOR ME TODAY SIGHED CATHERINE BUT PERHAPS IT MAY COME TO NOTHING OR IT MAY HOLD UP BEFORE TWELVE PERHAPS IT MAY BUT THEN MY DEAR
BUT FOR PARTICULARS ISABELLA COULD WELL AFFORD TO WAIT THE NEEDFUL WAS COMPRISED IN MISTER MORLAND'S PROMISE HIS HONOUR WAS PLEDGED TO MAKE EVERYTHING EASY AND BY WHAT MEANS THEIR INCOME WAS TO BE FORMED WHETHER LANDED PROPERTY WERE TO BE RESIGNED
OH I AM IN SUCH ECSTASIES AT THE THOUGHTS OF A LITTLE COUNTRY AIR AND QUIET SO MUCH BETTER THAN GOING TO THE LOWER ROOMS WE SHALL DRIVE DIRECTLY TO CLIFTON AND DINE THERE
AND IF SHE HAD NOT A PENNY WHY SO MUCH THE BETTER VERY TRUE I THINK LIKE YOU THERE IF THERE IS A GOOD FORTUNE ON ONE SIDE THERE CAN BE NO OCCASION FOR ANY ON THE OTHER NO MATTER WHICH HAS IT SO THAT THERE IS ENOUGH
IT IS VERY ODD BUT I SUPPOSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO DIRTY FOR A WALK AND WELL THEY MIGHT FOR I NEVER SAW SO MUCH DIRT IN MY LIFE WALK YOU COULD NO MORE WALK THAN YOU COULD FLY IT HAS NOT BEEN SO DIRTY THE WHOLE WINTER IT IS ANKLE DEEP EVERYWHERE
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW VEXED I AM I SHALL HAVE NO PLEASURE AT CLIFTON NOR IN ANYTHING ELSE I HAD RATHER TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER GET OUT NOW AND WALK BACK TO THEM HOW COULD YOU SAY YOU SAW THEM DRIVING OUT IN A PHAETON THORPE DEFENDED HIMSELF VERY STOUTLY
IT WAS TOO DIRTY FOR MISSUS ALLEN TO ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND TO THE PUMP ROOM HE ACCORDINGLY SET OFF BY HIMSELF AND CATHERINE HAD BARELY WATCHED HIM DOWN THE STREET WHEN HER NOTICE WAS CLAIMED BY THE APPROACH OF THE SAME TWO OPEN CARRIAGES
BE MY ONLY CHOICE THIS CHARMING SENTIMENT RECOMMENDED AS MUCH BY SENSE AS NOVELTY GAVE CATHERINE A MOST PLEASING REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THE HEROINES OF HER ACQUAINTANCE AND SHE THOUGHT HER FRIEND NEVER LOOKED MORE LOVELY THAN IN UTTERING THE GRAND IDEA
SO VERY LITTLE DID THEY APPEAR TO DWELL ON HER MIND AND SO VERY INADEQUATE WAS THE COMFORT SHE OFFERED DO NOT BE SO DULL MY DEAREST CREATURE SHE WHISPERED YOU WILL QUITE BREAK MY HEART IT WAS AMAZINGLY SHOCKING TO BE SURE
SHE WAS LESS AND LESS DISPOSED EITHER TO BE AGREEABLE HERSELF OR TO FIND HER COMPANION SO AND THEY RETURNED TO PULTENEY STREET WITHOUT HER SPEAKING TWENTY WORDS AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE THE FOOTMAN TOLD HER THAT A GENTLEMAN AND LADY HAD CALLED
I REMEMBER I WORE MY YELLOW GOWN WITH MY HAIR DONE UP IN BRAIDS AND WHEN I CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND JOHN INTRODUCED HIM I THOUGHT I NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO HANDSOME BEFORE HERE
BUT HERE IS YOUR SISTER SAYS SHE WILL NOT GO BLAIZE CASTLE CRIED CATHERINE WHAT IS THAT THE FINEST PLACE IN ENGLAND WORTH GOING FIFTY MILES AT ANY TIME TO SEE
BUT WHAT WILL YOUR EXCELLENT FATHER AND MOTHER SAY OH HEAVENS WHEN I THINK OF THEM I AM SO AGITATED CATHERINE'S UNDERSTANDING BEGAN TO AWAKE AN IDEA OF THE TRUTH SUDDENLY DARTED INTO HER MIND AND
IN MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN BY THE COMMUNICATION OF THE WONDERFUL EVENT HOW GREAT WAS HER DISAPPOINTMENT THE IMPORTANT AFFAIR WHICH MANY WORDS OF PREPARATION USHERED IN HAD BEEN FORESEEN BY THEM BOTH EVER SINCE HER BROTHER'S ARRIVAL
AND HURRYING BACK TO THE HOTEL SWALLOWED THEIR DINNER IN HASTE TO PREVENT BEING IN THE DARK AND THEN HAD A DELIGHTFUL DRIVE BACK ONLY THE MOON WAS NOT UP AND IT RAINED A LITTLE AND MISTER MORLAND'S HORSE WAS SO TIRED HE COULD HARDLY GET IT ALONG
MY NOTION OF THINGS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH LET ME ONLY HAVE THE GIRL I LIKE SAY I WITH A COMFORTABLE HOUSE OVER MY HEAD AND WHAT CARE I FOR ALL THE REST FORTUNE IS NOTHING I AM SURE OF A GOOD INCOME OF MY OWN
MAY WE GO UP EVERY STAIRCASE AND INTO EVERY SUITE OF ROOMS YES YES EVERY HOLE AND CORNER BUT THEN IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE GONE OUT FOR AN HOUR TILL IT IS DRYER AND CALL BY AND BY
OR FUNDED MONEY MADE OVER WAS A MATTER IN WHICH HER DISINTERESTED SPIRIT TOOK NO CONCERN SHE KNEW ENOUGH TO FEEL SECURE OF AN HONOURABLE AND SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT AND HER IMAGINATION TOOK A RAPID FLIGHT OVER ITS ATTENDANT FELICITIES
THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND IT STILL RAINED YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO MY DEAR I DO NOT QUITE DESPAIR YET I SHALL NOT GIVE IT UP TILL A QUARTER AFTER TWELVE
AND THAT IF PEOPLE WHO ROLLED IN MONEY COULD NOT AFFORD THINGS HE DID NOT KNOW WHO COULD WHICH CATHERINE DID NOT EVEN ENDEAVOUR TO UNDERSTAND DISAPPOINTED OF WHAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN THE CONSOLATION FOR HER FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT
THIS WAS OF COURSE VEHEMENTLY TALKED DOWN AS NO REASON AT ALL MISSUS ALLEN WAS CALLED ON TO SECOND HIM AND THE TWO OTHERS WALKED IN TO GIVE THEIR ASSISTANCE MY SWEETEST CATHERINE IS NOT THIS DELIGHTFUL WE SHALL HAVE A MOST HEAVENLY DRIVE
THEY PROMISED TO COME AT TWELVE ONLY IT RAINED BUT NOW AS IT IS SO FINE I DARE SAY THEY WILL BE HERE SOON NOT THEY INDEED CRIED THORPE FOR AS WE TURNED INTO BROAD STREET I SAW THEM DOES HE NOT DRIVE A PHAETON WITH BRIGHT CHESTNUTS
FOR BY THE TIME AUNTY'S ANKLE IS WELL SHE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO TORONTO SHE HAS TO BE THERE BY A CERTAIN DATE WELL SIGHED ANNE
HELD A SHEAF OF BLUEBELLS THE DARK CORNERS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE GRATE WERE LIGHTED UP WITH JARS FULL OF GLOWING CRIMSON PEONIES AND THE GRATE ITSELF WAS AFLAME WITH YELLOW POPPIES
FOR EDITORS INSIST ON PLOTS SO PRISCILLA SAYS OH THERE'S MISS SARAH COPP NOW PLEASE DIANA GO AND EXPLAIN MISS SARAH COPP WAS A SMALL PERSON
GIRLS WE MUST HAVE DINNER EVERYBODY IS HUNGRY AND IT'S NO USE WAITING ANY LONGER PRISCILLA AND MISSUS MORGAN ARE NOT COMING THAT'S PLAIN AND NOTHING IS BEING IMPROVED BY WAITING ANNE AND DIANA SET ABOUT LIFTING THE DINNER
MARILLA DIANA AND ANNE FLED OUT THE LATTER PAUSING ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO SET THE PRECIOUS PLATTER HASTILY DOWN ON THE SECOND STEP OF THE STAIRS WHEN THEY REACHED THE PANTRY A TRULY HARROWING SPECTACLE MET THEIR EYES
BUT IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT IT'S SURE TO POP OUT ANNE IF I WERE TO SAY I SEEN BEFORE MISSUS MORGAN I'D DIE OF MORTIFICATION AND IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD TO HAVE NOTHING TO SAY I'M NERVOUS ABOUT A GOOD MANY THINGS SAID ANNE
I SET THAT PLATTER THERE AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT I AM PROPERLY PUNISHED FOR MY CARELESSNESS BUT OH WHAT WILL MISS BARRY SAY WELL YOU KNOW SHE ONLY BOUGHT IT SO IT ISN'T THE SAME AS IF IT WAS AN HEIRLOOM
I'VE LIVED HERE FOR SIXTY YEARS AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THE POND YET WELL IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND SAID ANNE ROGUISHLY SUPPOSE YOU COME WITH US TOMORROW WE'LL SHUT GREEN GABLES UP AND SPEND THE WHOLE DAY AT THE SHORE DAFFING THE WORLD ASIDE
I THINK HE ONLY PUT IT ON BECAUSE HE WANTED TO CONCLUDE A BUSINESS DEAL WITH HARMON ANDREWS SAID ANNE I'VE HEARD HIM SAY THAT'S THE ONLY TIME A MAN NEEDS TO BE PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE BECAUSE IF HE LOOKS PROSPEROUS THE PARTY OF THE SECOND PART WON'T BE SO LIKELY TO TRY TO CHEAT HIM
A CONSTRUCTION OF LATHES WITH A PEAKED ROOF WHICH HAD IN TIMES PAST SERVED AS A HABITATION FOR DUCKS THE COPP GIRLS HAD GIVEN UP KEEPING DUCKS BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCH UNTIDY BIRDS
DID YOU GET VERY WET SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH NO RETURNED ANNE CHEERFULLY MY HEAD AND SHOULDERS ARE QUITE DRY AND MY SKIRT IS ONLY A LITTLE DAMP WHERE THE RAIN BEAT THROUGH THE LATHES
AND THE TREES SEEM TO BE STRETCHING OUT THEIR HANDS PLEADING FOR RAIN AS FOR MY GARDEN IT HURTS ME EVERY TIME I GO INTO IT I SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT A GARDEN WHEN THE FARMERS CROPS ARE SUFFERING SO
LET'S CARRY THE THINGS IN AND GET IT OVER IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THAT DINNER WAS A NOTABLE SUCCESS SOCIALLY THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY EXERTED THEMSELVES TO SAVE THE SITUATION AND MARILLA'S CUSTOMARY PLACIDITY WAS NOT NOTICEABLY RUFFLED
CROWDING DOWN TO THE ROADWAY WITH HERE AND THERE A BREAK WHERE THE BACK FIELD OF A SPENCERVALE FARM CAME OUT TO THE FENCE OR AN EXPANSE OF STUMPS WAS AFLAME WITH FIREWEED AND GOLDENROD WHY IS IT CALLED THE TORY ROAD ASKED ANNE
ANNE SLANTED BACK HER PARASOL AND WAVED AN ENCOURAGING HAND TO HER FRIEND BUT CONVERSATION AT THAT DISTANCE WAS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FINALLY THE RAIN CEASED THE SUN CAME OUT AND DIANA VENTURED ACROSS THE PUDDLES OF THE YARD
BUT PRACTICAL DAVY WHO AS ANNE OFTEN DESPAIRINGLY REMARKED HADN'T A PARTICLE OF IMAGINATION WAS ONLY PUZZLED AND DISGUSTED
DAVY HAD TO CLIMB ON THE TABLE AND REACH OVER TO THE SHELF AT A DANGEROUS ANGLE SOMETHING HE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN BY MARILLA TO DO AS HE HAD COME TO GRIEF ONCE BEFORE IN THE EXPERIMENT THE RESULT IN THIS INSTANCE WAS DISASTROUS
THAT SHE COULD HARDLY SEE ANNE THROUGH IT HOLDING THE PARASOL BRAVELY OVER HER BARE HEAD THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF THUNDER BUT FOR THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR THE RAIN CAME MERRILY DOWN OCCASIONALLY
BELIEVE YOU'RE JUST TALKING NONSENSE
DIANA HASTILY DRAGGED IN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED KEG AND ANNE FOUND THAT IT WAS JUST SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO FURNISH A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER FEET BUT SHE COULD NOT RELEASE HERSELF
FINALLY THE MORNING DAWNED PEARLY AND LUSTROUS IN A SKY FULL OF SILVER SHEEN AND RADIANCE AND THE WONDERFUL DAY HAD ARRIVED DIANA APPEARED SOON AFTER BREAKFAST WITH A BASKET OF FLOWERS OVER ONE ARM AND HER MUSLIN DRESS OVER THE OTHER
NO WE MUST JUST WAIT UNTIL THE COPP GIRLS COME HOME AND BIND THEM TO SECRECY THEY'LL KNOW WHERE THE AXE IS AND GET ME OUT I'M NOT UNCOMFORTABLE AS LONG AS I KEEP PERFECTLY STILL NOT UNCOMFORTABLE IN BODY I MEAN
AND IN SPITE OF HER LOVE FOR THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY SHE COULDN'T HELP THINKING HOW NICE IT WOULD BE WHEN EVERYBODY HAD GONE HOME AND SHE COULD BURY HER WEARINESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE PILLOWS OF THE EAST GABLE THERE IS AN OLD PROVERB THAT REALLY SEEMS AT TIMES TO BE INSPIRED
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE ANY HARM NO I DON'T THINK SO DECIDED ANNE AFTER DUE REFLECTION SINCE OUR MOTIVE IS NOT IDLE CURIOSITY THIS IMPORTANT POINT OF ETHICS BEING SETTLED ANNE PREPARED TO MOUNT THE AFORESAID LITTLE HOUSE
AND SAW FLASHES OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE TWILIGHT FROM DIANA'S WINDOW IN GROUPS OF FIVE WHICH MEANT ACCORDING TO THEIR OLD CHILDISH CODE COME OVER AT ONCE FOR I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO REVEAL ANNE THREW HER WHITE SHAWL OVER HER HEAD
OF COURSE THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS THAT HE MUST BE GOOD BUT HE TRIED TO BE GOOD AND I HADN'T THE HEART TO DISAPPOINT HIM YOU'LL DROWN YOURSELF OR THE TWINS ROWING ABOUT THE POND IN THAT FLAT GRUMBLED MARILLA
I THINK IT ALMOST PAYS FOR THE THUD WELL MAYBE IT DOES ADMITTED MARILLA I'D RATHER WALK CALMLY ALONG AND DO WITHOUT BOTH FLYING AND THUD BUT EVERYBODY HAS HER OWN WAY OF LIVING I USED TO THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE RIGHT WAY
WHILE THE TWILIGHT RAINED DOWN OUT OF A DAPPLED SKY I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THAT MISSUS MORGAN SHOULD REALLY COME BUT THERE THAT SPEECH SOUNDS AS PESSIMISTIC AS MISS ELIZA ANDREWS AND I'M ASHAMED OF MAKING IT
AND LOOKED MORE EXCITED THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO LOOK BEFORE AT HALF PAST TWELVE THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY CAME EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL BUT ANNE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL NERVOUS IT WAS SURELY TIME FOR PRISCILLA AND MISSUS MORGAN TO ARRIVE
MAYBE YOU COULD FIND ONE LIKE IT SOMEWHERE AND BUY IT FOR HER I'M AFRAID NOT PLATTERS AS OLD AS THAT ARE VERY SCARCE MISSUS LYNDE COULDN'T FIND ONE ANYWHERE FOR THE SUPPER I ONLY WISH I COULD FOR OF COURSE MISS BARRY WOULD JUST AS SOON HAVE ONE PLATTER AS ANOTHER
DAVY SLIPPED AND CAME SPRAWLING SQUARELY DOWN ON THE LEMON PIES HIS CLEAN BLOUSE WAS RUINED FOR THAT TIME AND THE PIES FOR ALL TIME IT IS HOWEVER AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY GOOD
YOU LOOK SIMPLY SWEET SAID ANNE ADMIRINGLY DIANA SIGHED
THE GIRLS REACHED SPENCERVALE AND TURNED DOWN THE TORY ROAD A GREEN SOLITARY HIGHWAY WHERE THE STRIPS OF GRASS BETWEEN THE WHEEL TRACKS BORE EVIDENCE TO LACK OF TRAVEL ALONG MOST OF ITS EXTENT IT WAS LINED WITH THICK SET YOUNG SPRUCES
IF YOU MEAN ECONOMICAL IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING FROM BEING STINGY IT IS AN EXCELLENT TRAIT IN A PERSON IF SHE IS ECONOMICAL IF MARILLA HAD BEEN STINGY SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN YOU AND DORA WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIED
SHE SAID AS SHE GINGERLY STEPPED ON THE ROOF
FOR SHE HAD PAID TWENTY DOLLARS FOR IT THE PLATTER HAD SERVED ITS PURPOSE AT THE AID BAZAAR AND HAD THEN BEEN RETURNED TO THE GREEN GABLES CLOSET FOR ANNE WOULD NOT TRUST ANYBODY BUT HERSELF TO TAKE IT BACK TO TOWN
BUT ANNE AND DIANA BETWEEN THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AND THE REACTION FROM THEIR EXCITEMENT OF THE FORENOON COULD NEITHER TALK NOR EAT ANNE TRIED HEROICALLY TO BEAR HER PART IN THE CONVERSATION FOR THE SAKE OF HER GUESTS BUT ALL THE SPARKLE HAD BEEN QUENCHED IN HER FOR THE TIME BEING
I'LL GO RIGHT OVER TO SPENCERVALE AFTER IT TOMORROW SAID ANNE RESOLUTELY AND YOU MUST COME WITH ME IT WILL BE SUCH A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND FOR I HAVE TO GO TO TOWN DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND HOW CAN I FACE YOUR AUNT JOSEPHINE WITHOUT A WILLOW WARE PLATTER
FOR IT HAS TRULY BEEN A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE A GOOD MANY MORE AND WORSE DISAPPOINTMENTS THAN THAT BEFORE YOU GET THROUGH LIFE
AND OH ANNE DEAR
FOR IT WOULD NOT DO TO DON IT UNTIL ALL THE DINNER PREPARATIONS WERE COMPLETED MEANWHILE SHE WORE HER AFTERNOON PINK PRINT AND A LAWN APRON FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY RUFFLED AND FRILLED AND VERY NEAT AND PRETTY AND ROSY SHE WAS
ADVISED DIANA AND ANNE ACCORDINGLY LEANED MUCH TO HER DELIGHT SHE SAW AS SHE PEERED THROUGH THE PANE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER EXACTLY SUCH AS SHE WAS IN QUEST OF ON THE SHELF IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW
WHERE THE CHICKENS WERE ALREADY SIZZLING SPLENDIDLY ANNE PREPARED THE POTATOES AND DIANA GOT THE PEAS AND BEANS READY THEN WHILE DIANA SHUT HERSELF INTO THE PANTRY TO COMPOUND THE LETTUCE SALAD ANNE WHOSE CHEEKS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO GLOW CRIMSON
FOR MARTHA COPP HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO KEEP ANYTHING SHE COULD SELL BUT IF THEY WON'T THERE'S A PLATTER AT WESLEY KEYSON'S AT SPENCERVALE AND SHE KNOWS THEY'D SELL IT BUT SHE ISN'T SURE IT'S JUST THE SAME KIND AS AUNT JOSEPHINE'S
AND I SAW MARY SENTNER FROM SPENCER VALE IN MISTER BLAIR'S STORE SHE SAYS THE OLD COPP GIRLS ON THE TORY ROAD HAVE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER AND SHE THINKS IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE WE HAD AT THE SUPPER SHE SAYS THEY'LL LIKELY SELL IT
WHICH WAS FULL OF AIRY SHADOWS AND WAVERING GOLDEN LIGHTS WE'LL DECORATE THE PARLOR FIRST WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
DON'T PITY ME DIANA FOR I HAVEN'T MINDED IT AT ALL I KEPT THINKING HOW MUCH GOOD THE RAIN WILL DO AND HOW GLAD MY GARDEN MUST BE FOR IT AND IMAGINING WHAT THE FLOWERS AND BUDS WOULD THINK WHEN THE DROPS BEGAN TO FALL
ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD HOPELESSLY NO THE SPLINTERS HURT TOO BADLY IF YOU CAN FIND AN AXE YOU MIGHT CHOP ME OUT THOUGH OH DEAR I DO REALLY BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS BORN UNDER AN ILL OMENED STAR DIANA SEARCHED FAITHFULLY
SHE PROMPTLY AGREED TO GIVE TWENTY FIVE AND MISS SARAH LOOKED AS IF SHE FELT SORRY SHE HADN'T ASKED FOR THIRTY WELL I GUESS YOU MAY HAVE IT I WANT ALL THE MONEY I CAN SCARE UP JUST NOW THE FACT IS
I'VE GOT THE PLATTER AND THAT RAIN HAS LAID THE DUST BEAUTIFULLY SO ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL WE'RE NOT HOME YET SAID DIANA RATHER PESSIMISTICALLY AND THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT MAY HAPPEN BEFORE WE ARE YOU'RE SUCH A GIRL TO HAVE ADVENTURES ANNE
JUST TO SHOW THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING DIANA'S FATHER WAS A LIBERAL FOR WHICH REASON SHE AND ANNE NEVER DISCUSSED POLITICS
OH DEAR THIS IS A DREADFUL PREDICAMENT I WOULDN'T MIND MY MISFORTUNES SO MUCH IF THEY WERE ROMANTIC AS MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES ALWAYS ARE
BUT COULDN'T BE DEPENDED ON TO REMAIN SO FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE COMING AFTER ALL SAID MARILLA CROSSLY ANNE AND DIANA SOUGHT COMFORT IN EACH OTHER'S EYES AT HALF PAST ONE MARILLA AGAIN EMERGED FROM THE PARLOR
SPREAD THE WRAPPING PAPER ON A SHINGLE DIANA HANDED UP AND WROTE OUT HER GARDEN IDYL UNDER CONDITIONS THAT COULD HARDLY BE CONSIDERED AS FAVORABLE TO LITERATURE NEVERTHELESS THE RESULT WAS QUITE PRETTY AND DIANA WAS ENRAPTURED WHEN ANNE READ IT TO HER OH
THAT IS THE PANTRY WINDOW I FEEL SURE SHE SAID
BUT IT'S WORTH TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IT'S A VERY OLD PLATTER DIANA GAVE ANNE'S FOOT A GENTLE KICK UNDER THE TABLE MEANING DON'T AGREE SHE'LL LET IT GO FOR TWENTY IF YOU HOLD OUT BUT ANNE WAS NOT MINDED TO TAKE ANY CHANCES IN REGARD TO THAT PRECIOUS PLATTER
AND THE DUST ON THE ROAD WAS SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AFTER SIX WEEKS OF DRY WEATHER OH I DO WISH IT WOULD RAIN SOON SIGHED ANNE EVERYTHING IS SO PARCHED UP THE POOR FIELDS JUST SEEM PITIFUL TO ME
MISTER ALLAN SAYS IT IS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CALLING A PLACE A GROVE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREES IN IT SAID DIANA FOR NOBODY LIVES ALONG THE ROAD EXCEPT THE COPP GIRLS
FINALLY THE GIRLS CAME TO THE OLD COPP HOMESTEAD A PLACE OF SUCH EXCEEDING EXTERNAL NEATNESS THAT EVEN GREEN GABLES WOULD HAVE SUFFERED BY CONTRAST THE HOUSE WAS A VERY OLD FASHIONED ONE SITUATED ON A SLOPE
AND DIANA HAVING MADE A HASTY PILGRIMAGE AROUND THE HOUSE RETURNED TO ANNOUNCE THAT A VERY BLACK CLOUD WAS RISING RAPIDLY IN THE NORTHWEST I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HEAVY THUNDER SHOWER SHE EXCLAIMED IN DISMAY
SAID MARILLA PUSHING HIM TOWARD THE HALL WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR DESSERT ASKED ANNE LOOKING REGRETFULLY AT THE WRECK AND RUIN GET OUT A CROCK OF STRAWBERRY PRESERVES SAID MARILLA CONSOLINGLY
WHERE'S DAVY SAID MARILLA WITH AN INDIFFERENT GLANCE AT THE STAR IN BED
WHICH FACT HAD NECESSITATED THE BUILDING OF A STONE BASEMENT UNDER ONE END THE HOUSE AND OUT BUILDINGS WERE ALL WHITEWASHED TO A CONDITION OF BLINDING PERFECTION AND NOT A WEED WAS VISIBLE IN THE PRIM KITCHEN GARDEN SURROUNDED BY ITS WHITE PALING
SAID MARILLA WHO HAD LISTENED TO THIS DIALOGUE WITH A RATHER GUILTY EXPRESSION I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D REMEMBER ABOUT THE SUGAR ANNE FOR I'M PERFECTLY CERTAIN YOU NEVER DID BEFORE SO I PUT IN A SPOONFUL
AND EVEN EXTORTED A TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION FROM MARILLA WHO CAME IN TO CRITICIZE AND REMAINED TO PRAISE NOW WE MUST SET THE TABLE SAID ANNE IN THE TONE OF A PRIESTESS ABOUT TO PERFORM SOME SACRED RITE IN HONOR OF A DIVINITY
DAVY WAS EMPHATIC ON THAT POINT NOR I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT TO UNCLE RICHARD NEITHER I'D FAR RATHER LIVE HERE EVEN IF MARILLA IS THAT LONG TAILED WORD WHEN IT COMES TO JAM CAUSE YOU'RE HERE ANNE
AND NOT SIT LIKE A MUTE SAID DIANA ANXIOUSLY ALL MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES CONVERSE SO BEAUTIFULLY BUT I'M AFRAID I'LL BE TONGUE TIED AND STUPID AND I'LL BE SURE TO SAY I SEEN I HAVEN'T OFTEN SAID IT SINCE MISS STACY TAUGHT HERE
I WONDER WHAT THE COPP GIRLS VALUE THIS HOUSE AT I SHALL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGE I'VE DONE BUT I WOULDN'T MIND THAT IF I WERE ONLY SURE THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND MY MOTIVE IN PEEPING IN AT THEIR PANTRY WINDOW MY SOLE COMFORT IS THAT THE PLATTER IS JUST THE KIND I WANT
SHE TURNED HER HEAD AT DAVY'S QUESTION AND ANSWERED DREAMILY OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON DOWN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW PAUL IRVING WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE MEANING OF THIS OR MADE A MEANING OUT OF IT FOR HIMSELF IF HE DIDN'T
THANKS EITHER TO THE LEMON JUICE OR TO THE UNUSUAL FLUSH ON HER CHEEKS WHEN THEY WERE READY THEY LOOKED QUITE AS SWEET AND TRIM AND GIRLISH AS EVER DID ANY OF MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES I DO HOPE I'LL BE ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING ONCE IN A WHILE
SHE HAD IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER PROMISE TO MISSUS LYNDE WRITTEN TO MISS BARRY OF CHARLOTTETOWN ASKING FOR THE LOAN OF IT MISS BARRY WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF ANNE'S AND SHE PROMPTLY SENT THE PLATTER OUT WITH A LETTER EXHORTING ANNE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF IT
IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS THE MEASURE OF THAT DAY'S TRIBULATIONS WAS NOT YET FULL JUST AS MISTER ALLAN HAD FINISHED RETURNING THANKS THERE AROSE A STRANGE OMINOUS SOUND ON THE STAIRS AS OF SOME HARD HEAVY OBJECT BOUNDING FROM STEP TO STEP
I PUT A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR IN WE ALWAYS DO DON'T YOU LIKE IT
I DON'T BELIEVE MISTER HARRISON WILL EVER MARRY HE SEEMS TO HAVE A PREJUDICE AGAINST MARRIAGE WELL YOU CAN NEVER TELL ABOUT THOSE OLD BACHELORS AND IF HE HAD A WHITE COLLAR ON I'D AGREE WITH RACHEL THAT IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS
TWENTY DOLLARS SAID ANNE WHO WAS NEVER MEANT TO MATCH BUSINESS WITS WITH A COPP OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED HER PRICE AT THE START WELL I'LL SEE SAID MISS SARAH CAUTIOUSLY
BUT SINCE I'VE HAD YOU AND THE TWINS TO BRING UP I DON'T FEEL SO SURE OF IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MISS BARRY'S PLATTER PAY HER BACK THE TWENTY DOLLARS SHE PAID FOR IT I SUPPOSE I'M SO THANKFUL IT WASN'T A CHERISHED HEIRLOOM BECAUSE THEN NO MONEY COULD REPLACE IT
NOBODY OBJECTED TO THIS AT HALF PAST ELEVEN THE LETTUCE SALAD WAS MADE THE GOLDEN CIRCLES OF THE PIES WERE HEAPED WITH WHIPPED CREAM AND EVERYTHING WAS SIZZLING AND BUBBLING THAT OUGHT TO SIZZLE AND BUBBLE WE'D BETTER GO AND DRESS NOW SAID ANNE FOR THEY MAY BE HERE BY TWELVE
I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR MISTER HARRISON
AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD CRASHED THROUGH THE ROOF UP TO HER ARMPITS AND THERE SHE HUNG QUITE UNABLE TO EXTRICATE HERSELF DIANA DASHED INTO THE DUCK HOUSE AND SEIZING HER UNFORTUNATE FRIEND BY THE WAIST
IT WOULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE TIME I HAD TO CONFESS ABOUT JUMPING ON THE SPARE ROOM BED BOTH GIRLS LAUGHED OVER THE OLD MEMORY CONCERNING WHICH IF ANY OF MY READERS ARE IGNORANT AND CURIOUS I MUST REFER THEM TO ANNE'S EARLIER HISTORY
IF BOTH WERE EQUALLY OLD AND GENUINE MARILLA LOOK AT THAT BIG STAR OVER MISTER HARRISON'S MAPLE GROVE WITH ALL THAT HOLY HUSH OF SILVERY SKY ABOUT IT IT GIVES ME A FEELING THAT IS LIKE A PRAYER AFTER ALL WHEN ONE CAN SEE STARS AND SKIES LIKE THAT
SO WE'LL HAVE DINNER AT ONE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN TWO HAPPIER AND MORE EXCITED GIRLS SOMEWHERE IN CANADA OR THE UNITED STATES AT THAT MOMENT BUT I DOUBT IT EVERY SNIP OF THE SCISSORS AS ROSE AND PEONY AND BLUEBELL FELL
YOU'VE GOT THE DEAREST DIMPLES AND IF I HAVE A FRECKLED NOSE THE SHAPE OF IT IS ALL RIGHT
AND SEE A GIRL'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS STICKING OUT OF THE ROOF OF ONE OF THEIR OUTHOUSES LISTEN IS THAT A WAGON
OR TILL TOMORROW SUGGESTED DIANA IF THEY'RE NOT BACK BY SUNSET YOU'LL HAVE TO GO FOR OTHER ASSISTANCE I SUPPOSE SAID ANNE RELUCTANTLY BUT YOU MUSTN'T GO UNTIL YOU REALLY HAVE TO
AS IT IS I DARESAY SHE'LL RAISE A FUSS MARTHA'S THE BOSS OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT I CAN TELL YOU I'M GETTING AWFUL TIRED OF LIVING UNDER ANOTHER WOMAN'S THUMB BUT COME IN COME IN YOU MUST BE REAL TIRED AND HUNGRY
MISS COPP SHE SAID EARNESTLY I ASSURE YOU I LOOKED INTO YOUR PANTRY WINDOW ONLY TO DISCOVER IF YOU HAD A WILLOW WARE PLATTER I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE I DIDN'T LOOK FOR ANYTHING ELSE BLESS YOU THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WELL LET'S FORGET OUR TROUBLES AND THINK OF OUR MERCIES SAID ANNE GAILY MISSUS ALLAN SAYS THAT WHENEVER WE THINK OF ANYTHING THAT IS A TRIAL TO US WE SHOULD ALSO THINK OF SOMETHING NICE THAT WE CAN SET OVER AGAINST IT IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY TOO PLUMP
SAVE AS AN ABODE OF CORRECTION FOR SETTING HENS ALTHOUGH SCRUPULOUSLY WHITEWASHED IT HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT SHAKY AND ANNE FELT RATHER DUBIOUS AS SHE SCRAMBLED UP FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A KEG PLACED ON A BOX I'M AFRAID IT WON'T BEAR MY WEIGHT
FORTUNATELY FOR ANNE MARILLA CALLED OUT AT THIS MOMENT FROM HER ROOM ANNE DIANA'S SIGNALING AT A GREAT RATE YOU'D BETTER SEE WHAT SHE WANTS ANNE RAN TO THE EAST GABLE
WHERE HE ALREADY KEPT A SCORE OR SO OF SIMILAR BALLS WHICH SO FAR AS COULD BE DISCOVERED
AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THINGS JUST AS GOOD AND FAR BETTER ARE COMING TRUE FOR ME ALL THE TIME AND I SUPPOSE THE EVENTS OF TODAY HAVE A FUNNY SIDE TOO PERHAPS WHEN DIANA AND I ARE OLD AND GRAY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO LAUGH OVER THEM
WHEN ANNE AND DIANA FINISHED WITH THE ROOM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED IT A GREAT BLUE BOWLFUL OF SNOWBALLS OVERFLOWED ON THE POLISHED TABLE THE SHINING BLACK MANTELPIECE WAS HEAPED WITH ROSES AND FERNS EVERY SHELF OF THE WHAT NOT
BUT NO AXE WAS TO BE FOUND I'LL HAVE TO GO FOR HELP SHE SAID RETURNING TO THE PRISONER NO INDEED YOU WON'T SAID ANNE VEHEMENTLY IF YOU DO THE STORY OF THIS WILL GET OUT EVERYWHERE AND I SHALL BE ASHAMED TO SHOW MY FACE
FOR HAD SHE NOT IN KEEN REMEMBRANCE OF MANY SIMILAR SNUBS ADMINISTERED IN HER OWN EARLY YEARS SOLEMNLY VOWED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER TELL ANY CHILD IT WAS TOO LITTLE TO UNDERSTAND YET HERE SHE WAS DOING IT
FINISHING UP WITH A GRAND SMASH AT THE BOTTOM EVERYBODY RAN OUT INTO THE HALL
SHE MADE FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE GATE AND LOOKED AS ANXIOUSLY DOWN THE LANE AS EVER HER NAMESAKE IN THE BLUEBEARD STORY PEERED FROM THE TOWER CASEMENT SUPPOSE THEY DON'T COME AT ALL SHE SAID PITEOUSLY DON'T SUPPOSE IT
SAID DIANA TRYING TO CONSOLE THE GUESTS WENT AWAY SOON AFTER FEELING THAT IT WAS THE MOST TACTFUL THING TO DO AND ANNE AND DIANA WASHED THE DISHES TALKING LESS THAN THEY HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO DO BEFORE THEN DIANA WENT HOME WITH A HEADACHE
MISSUS MORGAN IS COMING TODAY ANNE WONDERED HOW MISTER HARRISON COULD GO ON PLACIDLY MOWING HAY IN THE FIELD ACROSS THE LANE JUST AS IF NOTHING WERE GOING TO HAPPEN THE PARLOR AT GREEN GABLES WAS A RATHER SEVERE AND GLOOMY APARTMENT
IT SEEMS TO ME ANNE THAT YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO OUTGROW YOUR FASHION OF SETTING YOUR HEART SO ON THINGS AND THEN CRASHING DOWN INTO DESPAIR BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET THEM I KNOW I'M TOO MUCH INCLINED THAT WAY AGREED ANNE RUEFULLY
SAID DIANA WHO HOWEVER WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE UNCOMFORTABLE MISGIVINGS ON THE SUBJECT ANNE SAID MARILLA COMING OUT FROM THE PARLOR
I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN FOR YOU IN THE WAY OF TEA BUT I WARN YOU NOT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT BREAD AND BUTTER AND SOME COWCUMBERS MARTHA LOCKED UP ALL THE CAKE AND CHEESE AND PRESERVES AFORE SHE WENT SHE ALWAYS DOES BECAUSE SHE SAYS I'M TOO EXTRAVAGANT WITH THEM IF COMPANY COMES
WE'LL HAVE A BIG VASEFUL OF WILD ROSES IN THE CENTER AND ONE SINGLE ROSE IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY'S PLATE AND A SPECIAL BOUQUET OF ROSEBUDS ONLY BY MISSUS MORGAN'S AN ALLUSION TO THE ROSEBUD GARDEN YOU KNOW
AND SHE WAS RIGHT AS SHE ALWAYS IS DIANA UNTIED THE PONY AND DROVE INTO THE SHED JUST AS THE FIRST HEAVY DROPS OF RAIN FELL THERE SHE SAT AND WATCHED THE RESULTING DOWNPOUR WHICH WAS SO THICK AND HEAVY
DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN THE GOSSIP THAT MISTER HARRISON IS GOING TO SEE ISABELLA ANDREWS NO I'M SURE THERE ISN'T HE JUST CALLED THERE ONE EVENING ON BUSINESS WITH MISTER HARMON ANDREWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAW HIM AND SAID SHE KNEW HE WAS COURTING BECAUSE HE HAD A WHITE COLLAR ON
WITH ALL THE ZEST GONE OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL BE ABLE TO EAT A MOUTHFUL SAID DIANA DOLEFULLY NOR I
EXCEPT AT SUCH TIMES AS THEY CLUNG TO UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE'S BUTTONS EVEN ANNE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO INFUSE MUCH GRACE INTO IT FOR MARILLA WOULD NOT PERMIT ANY ALTERATIONS BUT IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT FLOWERS CAN ACCOMPLISH IF YOU GIVE THEM A FAIR CHANCE
SHE CARRIED THE PLATTER CAREFULLY TO THE FRONT DOOR WHERE HER GUESTS WERE ENJOYING THE COOL BREEZE THAT BLEW UP FROM THE BROOK IT WAS EXAMINED AND ADMIRED THEN JUST AS ANNE HAD TAKEN IT BACK INTO HER OWN HANDS A TERRIFIC CRASH AND CLATTER SOUNDED FROM THE KITCHEN PANTRY
WE MUST PREPARE FOR IT SAID ANNE TRANQUILLY A THUNDERSTORM SEEMED A TRIFLE IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED YOU'D BETTER DRIVE THE HORSE AND BUGGY INTO THAT OPEN SHED FORTUNATELY MY PARASOL IS IN THE BUGGY HERE TAKE MY HAT WITH YOU
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT FOR GIRLS I S'POSE BUT I WANT SOMETHING EXCITING LOTS OF KILLING AND SHOOTING IN IT
ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD OH NO IT WOULDN'T BE SUITABLE AT ALL THERE IS NO PLOT IN IT YOU SEE IT'S JUST A STRING OF FANCIES I LIKE WRITING SUCH THINGS BUT OF COURSE NOTHING OF THE SORT WOULD EVER DO FOR PUBLICATION
FOR MAYBE NOW MARTHA WILL AGREE TO HAVING IT TAKEN DOWN SHE NEVER WOULD BEFORE FOR FEAR IT MIGHT COME IN HANDY SOMETIME AND I'VE HAD TO WHITEWASH IT EVERY SPRING BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL ARGUE WITH A POST AS WITH MARTHA SHE WENT TO TOWN TODAY I DROVE HER TO THE STATION
MADE OF THE USUALLY DISMAL LITTLE ROOM
THE NEXT AFTERNOON THE GIRLS FARED FORTH ON THEIR PLATTER HUNTING EXPEDITION IT WAS TEN MILES TO SPENCERVALE AND THE DAY WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASANT FOR TRAVELING IT WAS VERY WARM AND WINDLESS
MISTER HARRISON SAYS HIS PASTURES ARE SO SCORCHED UP THAT HIS POOR COWS CAN HARDLY GET A BITE TO EAT AND HE FEELS GUILTY OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS EVERY TIME HE MEETS THEIR EYES AFTER A WEARISOME DRIVE
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH FEAR THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK AND TO DO HER JUSTICE THERE WASN'T ANNE SHROUDED HER MUSLIN GLORIES IN A BIG APRON AND WENT DOWN TO CONCOCT HER SOUP MARILLA HAD DRESSED HERSELF AND THE TWINS
BUT I WAS TIMID AND FRIGHTENED OF FATHER BESIDES I DIDN'T KNOW MEN WERE SO SKURSE WHEN THE GIRLS WERE SAFELY AWAY DIANA DRIVING AND ANNE HOLDING THE COVETED PLATTER CAREFULLY ON HER LAP
THE TABLE WAS SET IN THE SITTING ROOM WITH MARILLA'S FINEST LINEN AND THE BEST CHINA GLASS AND SILVER YOU MAY BE PERFECTLY CERTAIN THAT EVERY ARTICLE PLACED ON IT WAS POLISHED OR SCOURED TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PERFECTION OF GLOSS AND GLITTER
SAID MISS SARAH AMIABLY YOU NEEDN'T WORRY THERE'S NO HARM DONE THANK GOODNESS WE COPPS KEEP OUR PANTRIES PRESENTABLE AT ALL TIMES AND DON'T CARE WHO SEES INTO THEM AS FOR THAT OLD DUCKHOUSE I'M GLAD IT'S SMASHED
THE LOVE WHICH IS MY PRIDE AND WHENCE I HAVE DRAWN AS FROM A MAGIC FOUNTAIN FRESH LIFE
YOU ARE SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL RENEE AND YOUR BEAUTY IS OF THE STATUESQUE AND REGAL TYPE ON WHICH TIME LEAVES BUT LITTLE IMPRESSION NO DOUBT THE LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DEPENDS LESS ON OUTWARD BEAUTY THAN ON GRACES OF CHARACTER
ONE EVENING HE TENTATIVELY SUGGESTED THAT I ONLY MARRIED HIM TO ESCAPE THE CONVENT I CANNOT DENY IT WAS MY GRAVE REPLY MY DEAR IT TOUCHED ME TO THE HEART TO SEE THE TWO GREAT TEARS WHICH STOOD IN HIS EYES
A PROVENCAL LAD AND THE OLD WOMAN WHO USED TO WAIT ON HIS WIFE THE ROOMS ARE SCANTILY FURNISHED NEVERTHELESS THE HOUSE OF L'ESTORADE HAD DONE ITS BEST THE CUPBOARDS HAD BEEN RANSACKED AND ITS LAST MAN BEATEN UP FOR THE DINNER
LA CRAMPADE FEBRUARY MY DEAR LOUISE I WAS BOUND TO WAIT SOME TIME BEFORE WRITING TO YOU BUT NOW I KNOW OR RATHER I HAVE LEARNED MANY THINGS WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FUTURE HAPPINESS I MUST TELL YOU
ONLY A SIMPLE COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING BENEATH ONE OF OUR HILLS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THAT NOBLE VALLEY THE PRIDE OF WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE THE BUILDING IS QUITE UNPRETENTIOUS FOUR PEBBLE WALLS COVERED WITH A YELLOWISH WASH
A FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS LEADS TO THE DOOR WHICH IS PROTECTED BY A PENT HOUSE ROOF
OCTOBER HOW DEEPLY YOUR LETTER MOVED ME ABOVE ALL WHEN I COMPARE OUR WIDELY DIFFERENT DESTINIES HOW BRILLIANT IS THE WORLD YOU ARE ENTERING HOW PEACEFUL THE RETREAT WHERE I SHALL END MY MODEST CAREER
WITH MAGIC TOUCH I HAVE EFFACED THE VERY MEMORY OF HIS SUFFERINGS IT IS A COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS LOUIS IS REALLY VERY ATTRACTIVE NOW FEELING SURE OF MY AFFECTION HE THROWS OFF HIS RESERVE AND DISPLAYS UNSUSPECTED GIFTS
BUILT OF BIG ROUND PEBBLES SET IN LAYERS ALTERNATELY SLOPING OR UPRIGHT ACCORDING TO THE ARTISTIC TASTE OF THE MASON WHICH FINDS HERE ITS ONLY OUTLET THE MUD IN WHICH THEY ARE SET IS FALLING AWAY IN PLACES
I CAN'T TELL YOU ALL MY REASONS FOR THIS TO YOU ALONE SHALL I CONFIDE EVEN AS MUCH AS THIS I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN WHETHER PASSIONATELY LOVED OR NOT LOSE MUCH IN THEIR RELATION WITH THEIR HUSBANDS BY NOT CONCEALING THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT MARRIAGE AND THE WAY THEY LOOK AT IT
OUR OWN IMPULSE SHALL WITH US ALONE DICTATE THE EXPRESSION OF FEELING WE SHALL BE FREE EVEN IN OUR FETTERS I SHALL HAVE THE MORE PRIDE IN WOOING YOU AGAIN NOW THAT I KNOW THE REWARD YOU PLACE ON VICTORY YOU CANNOT SPEAK BREATHE
SECURE OF MY FREEDOM I WAS ABLE TO THROW MYSELF GAILY INTO THE PETTY DETAILS WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANY A CEREMONY OF THE KIND AND TO BE MY NATURAL SELF PERHAPS I MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR AN OLD BIRD AS THEY SAY AT BLOIS
I DREW HIM ASIDE IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER ON SOLITARY WALKS DURING WHICH I DISCREETLY SOUNDED HIS FEELINGS I MADE HIM TALK AND GOT HIM TO EXPOUND TO ME HIS IDEAS AND PLANS FOR OUR FUTURE MY QUESTIONS BETRAYED SO MANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
AND INVEST HER WITH AN EXHAUSTLESS POWER A REDUNDANCY OF LIFE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING BLOSSOM AROUND HER THE MORE SHE IS MISTRESS OF HERSELF THE MORE CERTAINLY WILL THE LOVE AND HAPPINESS SHE CREATES BE FIT TO WEATHER THE STORMS OF LIFE
AND TRY TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT THE SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT I WAS UNDERTAKING FILLED ME AT FIRST WITH TERROR MARRIAGE IS A MATTER CONCERNING THE WHOLE OF LIFE WHILST LOVE AIMS ONLY AT PLEASURE
RAISED IN HIS NURSERY WITH A SPECIAL VIEW TO THIS ACQUISITION THE BARON HAVING FOUND HIS LONG LOST SON HAS NOW BUT ONE THOUGHT TO MARRY HIM AND MARRY HIM TO A GIRL OF GOOD FAMILY
A FRIENDSHIP WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF THESE ADVANTAGES WOULD SHUT ITS EYES TO MANY OF THE IMPERFECTIONS OF HUMANITY NOW THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXISTENCE OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MYSELF AND LOUIS DE L'ESTORADE
IN THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE
AND THAT I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED HIS FATHER SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOOK AFTER THE ESTATE AND PRACTISE ECONOMIES BECAUSE I WISHED HIM TO DEVOTE HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO POLITICS IF WE HAD CHILDREN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM ALL PROSPEROUS AND WITH GOOD STATE APPOINTMENTS
PERHAPS SOME DAY THE COUNTRY DAME MAY GO AND SPEND A WINTER IN MARSEILLES BUT DANGER DOES NOT HAUNT THE PURLIEUS OF A NARROW PROVINCIAL STAGE THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO FEAR NOT EVEN AN ADMIRATION SUCH AS COULD ONLY MAKE A WOMAN PROUD
SO YOU MUST NARRATE TO ME IN FULL ALL YOUR ADVENTURES DESCRIBE YOUR BALLS AND PARTIES TELL ME WHAT YOU WEAR WHAT FLOWERS CROWN YOUR LOVELY GOLDEN LOCKS AND WHAT ARE THE WORDS AND MANNERS OF THE MEN YOU MEET
LIFE GIVES US BUT ONE FRIEND AND I WISH TO BE YOURS FRIENDSHIP IS THE BOND BETWEEN A PAIR OF KINDRED SOULS UNITED IN THEIR STRENGTH AND YET INDEPENDENT LET US BE FRIENDS AND COMRADES TO BEAR JOINTLY THE BURDEN OF LIFE
AND TO QUEEN IT IN PARIS YOUR POOR LITTLE SWEETHEART RENEE THAT CHILD OF THE DESERT HAS FALLEN FROM THE EMPYREAN WHITHER TOGETHER WE HAD SOARED INTO THE VULGAR REALITIES OF A LIFE AS HOMELY AS A DAISY'S
LEAVE ME ABSOLUTELY FREE I WOULD PUT NO HINDRANCE IN THE WAY OF YOUR INSPIRING ME WITH A LOVE SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN BUT I AM DETERMINED TO BE YOURS ONLY OF MY OWN FREE GIFT CREATE IN ME THE WISH TO GIVE UP MY FREEDOM
MY FATHER AND MOTHER ENTERED INTO THEIR NEIGHBOR'S IDEA WITH AN EYE TO MY INTERESTS SO SOON AS THEY DISCOVERED THAT RENEE DE MAUCOMBE WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE WITHOUT A DOWRY AND THAT THE MONEY THE SAID RENEE OUGHT TO INHERIT FROM HER PARENTS
WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED YOU WILL APPROVE THIS RESERVE ENOUGH THAT NOTHING WAS LACKING EITHER OF SATISFACTION FOR THE MOST FASTIDIOUS SENTIMENT OR OF THAT UNEXPECTEDNESS WHICH BRINGS IN A SENSE ITS OWN SANCTION
FOR HIS COQUETTISH WHITE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS BLUE ROOF GLITTERING IN THE SUN THE GARDEN AND SURROUNDING WALKS ARE HORRIBLY DUSTY AND THE TREES SEEM BURNT UP
AND ROOFED WITH HOLLOW TILES OF A GOOD RED CONSTITUTE THE GRANGE THE RAFTERS BEND UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THIS BRICK KILN THE WINDOWS INSERTED CASUALLY WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT SYMMETRY HAVE ENORMOUS SHUTTERS PAINTED YELLOW
WE SHALL TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN THE SILKWORMS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT OUR MULBERRY LEAVES WILL BE SOLD WE SHALL KNOW THE STRANGE VICISSITUDES OF LIFE IN PROVENCE AND THE STORMS THAT MAY ATTACK EVEN A PEACEFUL HOUSEHOLD
SHALL BE ALWAYS GREEN I SHALL CARRY MY PARK UP THE HILLSIDE AND PLANT ON THE HIGHEST POINT SOME PRETTY KIOSQUE WHENCE PERHAPS MY EYES MAY CATCH THE SHIMMER OF THE MEDITERRANEAN ORANGE AND LEMON TREES AND ALL CHOICEST THINGS THAT GROW
HAVING GOT AN INCH TO ASK FOR AN ELL AND YOU AND I SWEET LOVE ARE OF THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE IT ALL I WATCHED LOUIS OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE AND PUT IT TO MYSELF HAS SUFFERING HAD A SOFTENING OR A HARDENING EFFECT ON HIM
A YEAR HENCE HIS STYLE WILL HAVE STILL FURTHER IMPROVED LOUIS IS NOW IN HIS FIRST TRANSPORT WHAT I LOOK FORWARD TO IS THE UNIFORM AND CONTINUOUS SENSATION OF CONTENT WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE FRUIT OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE
AH MY LOVE BY THE ARDOR WITH WHICH HE EMBRACED MY PLANS I CAN GAUGE THE DEPTH OF HIS AFFECTION TO CONCLUDE HERE IS A LETTER HE WROTE ME YESTERDAY FROM MARSEILLES WHERE HE HAD GONE TO SPEND A FEW HOURS MY SWEET RENEE
HE WAS GREATLY ASTONISHED TO FIND ME AT ONCE SO REASONABLE AND SO APT AT REASONING BUT HE MADE ME A SOLEMN PROMISE AFTER WHICH I TOOK HIS HAND AND PRESSED IT AFFECTIONATELY WE WERE MARRIED AT THE END OF THE WEEK
WHY SHOULD WE NOT BOTH BE LAUGHING AND GAY IN YOUR PARIS WHENCE I SHALL CARRY YOU OFF NOW AND AGAIN TO MY BEAUTIFUL OASIS IN PROVENCE OH LOUISE DON'T SPOIL THE SPLENDID FUTURE WHICH AWAITS US BOTH DON'T DO THE MAD THINGS WITH WHICH YOU THREATEN ME
WHOSE WORDS THRILLED ME AND ON WHOSE ARM I LEANT WITH PLEASURE BEYOND WORDS IN SHORT TO BE OPEN WITH YOU AS I WOULD BE WITH GOD BEFORE WHOM CONCEALMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE THE PERFECT LOYALTY WITH WHICH HE HAD KEPT HIS OATH MAY HAVE PIQUED ME
WHEN I AM WITH YOU LOVE SO TRANSPORTS ME THAT I AM POWERLESS TO EXPRESS THE DEPTH OF MY AFFECTION I CAN BUT WORSHIP AND ADMIRE ONLY AT A DISTANCE DOES THE POWER OF SPEECH RETURN
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GIRL AND A MARRIED WOMAN IS SO VAST THAT THE GIRL CAN NO MORE COMPREHEND IT THAN THE MARRIED WOMAN CAN GO BACK TO GIRLHOOD AGAIN
A LOOK OF YOUTH THE GREATER REFINEMENT WHICH I INTRODUCED INTO THE HOUSE WAS REFLECTED IN HIS PERSON INSENSIBLY I BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO HIS PRESENCE AND MADE ANOTHER SELF OF HIM
THIS DIFFICULTY THE FIRST WHICH HAS ARISEN IS THE ONLY ONE WHICH HAS DELAYED THE COMPLETION OF OUR MARRIAGE ALTHOUGH AT FIRST I MAY HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT ANYTHING RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT IT IS ONLY IN HUMAN NATURE
THAT LOUIS HAS SINCE CONFESSED TO ME THE ALARM IT CAUSED HIM TO FIND IN ME SO LITTLE OF THE IGNORANT MAIDEN THEN I LISTENED TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN REPLY HE GOT MIXED UP IN HIS ARGUMENTS AS PEOPLE DO WHEN HANDICAPPED BY FEAR
HAVING RENOUNCED ALL IDEA OF FINDING IN MARRIAGE THOSE TRANSPORTS OF LOVE ON WHICH OUR MINDS USED SO OFTEN AND WITH SUCH PERILOUS RAPTURE TO DWELL I FOUND A GENTLE CALM SETTLING OVER ME IF DEBARRED FROM LOVE
WHAT GRATITUDE COULD YOU FEEL TO ME LATER FOR A GIFT IN WHICH MY GOODWILL COUNTED FOR NOTHING IF DURING THE TIME THAT I REMAINED INDIFFERENT TO YOU YIELDING ONLY A PASSIVE OBEDIENCE SUCH AS MY MOTHER HAS JUST BEEN URGING ON ME A CHILD WERE BORN TO US
MY ONE JOY AND IT IS SUPREME SPRINGS FROM THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING BROUGHT NEW LIFE TO MY HUSBAND BEFORE I HAVE BORNE HIM ANY CHILDREN LOUIS HAS REGAINED HIS YOUTH STRENGTH AND SPIRITS HE IS NOT THE SAME MAN
SPARE ME THE ANNOYANCES TO WHICH THE STRANGENESS OF OUR MUTUAL POSITION MIGHT GIVE RISE TO OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHERS I AM NEITHER WHIMSICAL NOR PRUDISH AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO GET THAT REPUTATION
DURING THIS TIME I MADE A CLOSE STUDY OF MANY SMALL PERSONAL MATTERS WHICH HAVE MORE TO DO WITH LOVE THAN IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED IN SPITE OF MY COLDNESS LOUIS GREW BOLDER AND HIS NATURE EXPANDED I SAW ON HIS FACE A NEW EXPRESSION
OLD GENTLEMAN OF GOOD FAMILY WHO HAS MADE HIMSELF RICH AFTER THE PROVINCIAL FASHION BY SCRAPING AND PARING
MARRIAGE SOON BECOMES INTOLERABLE UNLESS THE WOMAN IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT A WOMAN IN SUCH A CASE NEEDS THE CHARM OF A MISTRESS COMBINED WITH THE SOLID QUALITIES OF A WIFE
WHICH WAS SERVED TO US ON OLD SILVER DISHES BLACKENED AND BATTERED THE EXILE MY DARLING PET IS LIKE THE RAILING EMACIATED HE IS PALE AND SILENT AND BEARS TRACES OF SUFFERING AT THIRTY SEVEN HE MIGHT BE FIFTY
DO NOT FANCY I CONCLUDED THAT I ASK THIS FROM ANY WISH TO BE ECCENTRIC IT IS THE GREAT DESIRE I HAVE FOR YOUR RESPECT WHICH PROMPTS MY REQUEST IF YOU OWE THE CROWN OF YOUR LOVE MERELY TO THE LEGAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY
YOU SEE THAT HE FANCIES HIMSELF VANITY OF MEN THE CHOSEN OF MY HEART JUST AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO LEGAL BONDS NEVERTHELESS I HAVE NOT YET GOT BEYOND THAT EXTERNAL ATTRACTION WHICH GIVES US STRENGTH TO PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL
SHALL EMBELLISH MY RETREAT AND THERE WILL I BE A MOTHER AMONG MY CHILDREN THE POETRY OF NATURE WHICH NOTHING CAN DESTROY SHALL HEDGE US ROUND AND STANDING LOYALLY AT THE POST OF DUTY WE NEED FEAR NO DANGER
IN A COUNTRY LIFE SUCH AS OURS WILL BE OUGHT WE NOT TO BEAR IN MIND THE EVANESCENT NATURE OF PASSION IS IT NOT SIMPLE PRUDENCE TO MAKE PROVISION BEFOREHAND AGAINST THE CALAMITIES INCIDENT TO CHANGE OF FEELING
INFUSE WITH PASSION THEN IF YOU WILL THIS FRIENDSHIP AND LET THE VOICE OF LOVE DISTURB ITS CALM ON MY PART I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO BRING MY FEELINGS INTO ACCORD WITH YOURS ONE THING ABOVE ALL I WOULD BEG OF YOU
AH DARLING MY LIFE UNROLLS ITSELF BEFORE MY EYES LIKE ONE OF THE GREAT HIGHWAYS OF FRANCE LEVEL AND EASY SHADED WITH EVERGREEN TREES THIS CENTURY WILL NOT SEE ANOTHER BONAPARTE
I HAVE VOWED TO MYSELF TO COMFORT THIS YOUNG MAN WHO HAS NEVER KNOWN YOUTH BUT PASSED STRAIGHT FROM HIS MOTHER'S ARMS TO THE EMBRACE OF WAR AND FROM THE JOYS OF HIS COUNTRY HOME TO THE FROSTS AND FORCED LABOR OF SIBERIA
AT LAST IT DAWNED UPON ME THAT THE UNEXPECTED RETURN OF THIS SON WAS THE CAUSE OF MY OWN WHO COULD HAVE IMAGINED WHILST FANCY WAS LEADING US A GIDDY DANCE
WOULD BE DULY ACKNOWLEDGED AS HERS IN THE CONTRACT IN A SIMILAR WAY MY YOUNGER BROTHER JEAN DE MAUCOMBE AS SOON AS HE CAME OF AGE SIGNED A DOCUMENT STATING THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM HIS PARENTS
I SHALL TAKE A LEADING PART IN THE PUBLIC LIFE OF THE DISTRICT AND ON YOU SHALL FALL THE RAYS OF A GLORY WHICH WILL OWE ITS EXISTENCE TO THE DESIRE OF PLEASING YOU SO MUCH FOR MY PUPIL DEAR DO YOU SUPPOSE HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN LIKE THIS BEFORE
YOUR FAVORS TO ME HOWEVER SLIGHT WILL ALWAYS MAKE MY HAPPINESS IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE AS NOW FOR I AM SENSIBLE HOW MUCH DIGNITY THERE IS IN OUR PROMISE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S LIBERTY
ON THE OTHER HAND MARRIAGE WILL REMAIN WHEN PLEASURES HAVE VANISHED AND IT IS THE SOURCE OF INTERESTS FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN THOSE OF THE MAN AND WOMAN ENTERING ON THE ALLIANCE MIGHT IT NOT THEREFORE BE THAT THE ONLY REQUISITE FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE WAS FRIENDSHIP
WHY NOT SEEK FOR HAPPINESS I SAID TO MYSELF MOREOVER I AM LOVED AND THE LOVE OFFERED ME I SHALL ACCEPT MY MARRIED LIFE WILL BE NO SLAVERY BUT RATHER A PERPETUAL REIGN
THAT MY DESTINED HUSBAND WAS SLOWLY TRAVELING ON FOOT THROUGH RUSSIA POLAND AND GERMANY HIS BAD LUCK ONLY FORSOOK HIM AT BERLIN WHERE THE FRENCH MINISTER HELPED HIS RETURN TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
AND OBTAINING FOR IT THE MAXIMUM OF PLEASURE WITH THE MINIMUM OF COST I HAVE ALREADY CONVINCED LOUIS OF THE NECESSITY OF GETTING ROADS MADE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY EARN THE REPUTATION OF A MAN INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF HIS DISTRICT
WITH THE ADDITION OF THE FATHER'S SAVINGS
YOU WHO OUGHT TO FIND YOUR MATE AMONGST THE GREAT ONES OF THE EARTH THE CHILDREN OF YOUR RENEE WILL NOT LACK A ZEALOUS PROTECTRESS FAREWELL THEN FOR ME AT LEAST TO THE ROMANCES AND THRILLING ADVENTURES IN WHICH WE USED OURSELVES TO PLAY THE PART OF HEROINE
RETAINING PERFECT INDEPENDENCE WHAT COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE MORE HONORABLE A CONTRACT OF THIS KIND DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE LEGAL CONTRACT AND EVEN TO THE SACRAMENT ITSELF COULD BE CONCLUDED ONLY BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
ACT OR THINK WITHOUT ADDING TO THE ADMIRATION I FEEL FOR YOUR CHARM BOTH OF BODY AND MIND THERE IS IN YOU A RARE COMBINATION OF THE IDEAL THE PRACTICAL AND THE BEWITCHING WHICH SATISFIES ALIKE JUDGMENT A HUSBAND'S PRIDE DESIRE AND HOPE
HUMBLE COUNTRY PLEASURES WILL ENLIVEN THE MONOTONY OF MY FUTURE IT SHALL BE MY AMBITION TO ENLARGE THE OASIS ROUND MY HOUSE AND TO GIVE IT THE LORDLY SHADE OF FINE TREES
WILL HE FIND OUT THERE ARE TWO I AM WRITING NONSENSE NOW AND AS HENCEFORTH I CAN ONLY BE FOOLISH BY PROXY I HAD BETTER STOP ONE KISS THEN ON EACH CHEEK MY LIPS ARE STILL VIRGINAL HE HAS ONLY DARED TO TAKE MY HAND
THE FORCE THUS DEVELOPED AT ONCE IMPETUOUS AND ENDURING SIMPLE AND DIVERSIFIED BRINGS FORTH ULTIMATELY THE FAMILY THAT NOBLE PRODUCT OF WOMANHOOD WHICH I REALIZE NOW IN ALL ITS ANIMATING BEAUTY
BY DINT OF CLOSE STUDY I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS LOVE AMOUNTED TO A PASSION ONCE TRANSFORMED INTO AN IDOL WHOSE SLIGHTEST FROWN WOULD TURN HIM WHITE AND TREMBLING I REALIZED THAT I MIGHT VENTURE ANYTHING
AND MY CHILDREN IF I HAVE ANY WILL NOT BE RENT FROM ME THEY WILL BE MINE TO TRAIN AND MAKE MEN OF THE JOY OF MY LIFE IF YOU ALSO ARE TRUE TO YOUR DESTINY
BITTERLY ASHAMED I STRUGGLED WITH MYSELF ALAS WHEN PRIDE IS THE ONLY MOTIVE FOR RESISTANCE EXCUSES FOR CAPITULATION ARE SOON FOUND WE CELEBRATED OUR UNION IN SECRET AND SECRET IT MUST REMAIN BETWEEN US
RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT THAT AT LEAST IS PLAIN SO SOON AS I REALIZED THAT THE CONVENT WAS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO MARRYING LOUIS I HAD AS GIRLS SAY TO SUBMIT
THAT HE WILL LEAVE THE REINS IN HIS WIFE'S HANDS AND AS I SHALL DO NOTHING TO REMIND HIM OF THIS WISE RESOLVE IT IS LIKELY HE MAY PERSEVERE IN IT YOU MY DEAR LOUISE WILL SUPPLY THE ROMANCE OF MY LIFE
HIS FINE BLUE EYES ARE CAVERNOUS HE IS A LITTLE DEAF WHICH SUGGESTS THE KNIGHT OF THE SORROWFUL COUNTENANCE
AND BEFORE LONG IT BECAME CLEAR THAT CHANCE HAD GIVEN ME FOR ADVERSARY ONE WHO WAS THE LESS FITTED FOR THE CONTEST BECAUSE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU MAGNILOQUENTLY CALL MY GREATNESS OF SOUL BROKEN BY SUFFERINGS AND MISFORTUNE
SUCH IS YOUR FRIEND'S SPLENDID TITLE
IN THIS TASK TOWARDS WHICH MY EVERY ENERGY SHALL BE BENT WHILE IT REMAINS CONCEALED FROM ALL BUT GOD AND YOU I AM VERY NEARLY HAPPY NOW BUT SHOULD I BE SO WITHOUT A FRIENDLY HEART IN WHICH TO POUR THE CONFESSION FOR HOW MAKE A CONFIDANT OF HIM
DEAR THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH WOULD BESET MY LIFE HAD APPEARED TO ME CLEARLY AS IN A VISION AND I WAS SINCERELY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF THE MAN I MARRIED NOW IN THE SOLITUDE OF A LIFE LIKE OURS
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESE THREE OBVIOUS DRAWBACKS MADE HIM DISTRUSTFUL OF HIMSELF HE DOUBTED HIS POWER TO MAKE ME HAPPY AND GUESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS
THE WHOLE STORY OF MY LIFE LIES BEFORE ME NOW ITS GREAT CRISES WILL BE THE TEETHING AND NUTRITION OF THE YOUNG MASTERS DE L'ESTORADE AND THE MISCHIEF THEY DO TO MY SHRUBS AND ME TO EMBROIDER THEIR CAPS
BUT ABOVE ALL I HAVE INSISTED ON THE GREATEST SECRECY IN REGARD TO OUR DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS A HUSBAND WHO SUBMITS TO HIS WIFE'S YOKE IS JUSTLY HELD AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE A WOMAN'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE ENTIRELY CONCEALED
I FOUND MY ROOM ALMOST EXACTLY AS I LEFT IT
MY HAPPINESS WOULD WOUND HIM AND HAS TO BE CONCEALED HE IS SENSITIVE AS A WOMAN LIKE ALL MEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH FOR THREE MONTHS WE REMAINED AS WE WERE BEFORE MARRIAGE AS YOU MAY IMAGINE
WE SAT FIVE IN THE ANTIQUATED CARRIAGE AND ARRIVED IN STATE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK THE DINNER WAS FOR THREE AT THE GRANGE WHICH IS THE DWELLING OF THE BARON DE L'ESTORADE MY FATHER IN LAW TO BE HAS YOU SEE NO CASTLE
TO BE THE UNCEASING SPRING OF HAPPINESS FOR A MAN WHO KNOWS IT AND ADDS GRATITUDE TO LOVE AH DEAR ONE THIS IS A CONVICTION WHICH FORTIFIES THE SOUL EVEN MORE THAN THE MOST PASSIONATE LOVE CAN DO
BUT ONLY ON THE EXPRESS CONDITION OF BEING ALLOWED TO WORK MY WILL UPON THE GRANGE AND MAKE A PARK THERE I HAVE DEMANDED FROM MY FATHER IN SET TERMS A GRANT OF WATER WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT THITHER FROM MAUCOMBE
BY DINT OF CONSTANT WATCHING I DISCOVERED HOW HIS MIND AND COUNTENANCE HARMONIZE THE ANIMAL THAT WE CALL A HUSBAND TO QUOTE YOUR WORDS DISAPPEARED AND ONE BALMY EVENING I DISCOVERED IN HIS STEAD A LOVER
WAS A FIRST MEETING BETWEEN YOUR SWEETHEART AND THE EXILE THE COMTE DE MAUCOMBE'S SERVANTS DONNED THEIR OLD LACED LIVERIES AND HATS THE COACHMAN HIS GREAT TOP BOOTS
IN THE NEXT PLACE HE SHARES OUR VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF MY BEAUTY AND IT IS CRUEL FOR HIM TO SEE HOW THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS LIFE HAVE ROBBED HIM OF YOUTH FINALLY HE FELT THE SUPERIORITY OF MY WOMANHOOD OVER HIS MANHOOD
WHOM THE FATHER INTERVIEWED IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN DECLARED THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM TAKEN BY THE RUSSIANS
YET LOUIS IS LOVABLE HIS TEMPER IS WONDERFULLY EVEN AND HE PERFORMS AS A MATTER OF COURSE ACTS ON WHICH MOST MEN WOULD PLUME THEMSELVES IN SHORT IF I DO NOT LOVE HIM I SHALL FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN BEING GOOD TO HIM
UNDER PENALTY THEREFORE OF FORFEITING MY ESTEEM AND AFFECTION HE MUST GET HIMSELF CHOSEN DEPUTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AT THE COMING ELECTIONS MY FAMILY WOULD SUPPORT HIS CANDIDATURE AND WE SHOULD THEN HAVE THE DELIGHT OF SPENDING ALL OUR WINTERS IN PARIS
WHICH MY CHILDISH EYES USED TO SEE WITHOUT COMPREHENDING A FORTNIGHT AFTER MY ARRIVAL MY FATHER AND MOTHER TOOK ME ALONG WITH MY TWO BROTHERS TO DINE WITH ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS
HE HOARDED HIS INCOME FOR HIM AND GUARDED CAREFULLY THE PORTION OF INHERITANCE WHICH FELL TO HIM
SO HERE ARE MY BLACK HAIR AND MY BLACK EYES WHOSE LASHES ACT ACCORDING TO YOU LIKE VENETIAN BLINDS MY COMMANDING AIR AND MY WHOLE PERSON RAISED TO THE RANK OF SOVEREIGN POWER TEN YEARS HENCE DEAR
I LONG FOR THE DAY WHICH SHALL MAKE YOU A MOTHER THAT I MAY SEE YOU CONTENT WITH THE FULNESS OF YOUR LIFE MAY HEAR YOU IN THE SWEET VOICE I LOVE AND WITH THE THOUGHTS BLESS THE LOVE WHICH HAS REFRESHED MY SOUL AND GIVEN NEW VIGOR TO MY POWERS
FOR DEAR I HAVE MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION AFTER THE SNOWS OF SIBERIA A MAN IS READY ENOUGH TO SEE MERIT IN THOSE BLACK EYES WHICH ACCORDING TO YOU USED TO RIPEN FRUIT WITH A LOOK
THANKS TO AN IRON RAILING AT THE ENTRANCE FACING THE ROAD THIS SIMPLE FARM HAS A CERTAIN AIR OF BEING A COUNTRY SEAT
I INSIST TOO ON HIS STUDYING A GREAT DEAL BEFORE LONG I HOPE TO SEE HIM A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF MY FAMILY AND HIS MOTHER'S I HAVE TOLD HIM PLAINLY THAT I AM AMBITIOUS
EVEN THE OLD MAN WOULD NOT BE A BLOT UPON MY PRETTY HOME AND HAS BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO LINE WITH ALL MY IMPROVEMENTS TO PLEASE ME HE HAS ADOPTED THE DRESS AND WITH THE DRESS THE MANNERS OF THE DAY WE HAVE ENGLISH HORSES
A CODE WHICH WILL DRIVE AS MANY GIRLS OF GOOD FAMILY INTO CONVENTS AS IT WILL FIND HUSBANDS FOR THE FRENCH NOBILITY FROM THE LITTLE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER SEEM TO BE DIVIDED ON THESE MATTERS THE DINNER DARLING
WHICH ARE YOURS ALSO IN PERFECTION STILL LET ME SAY THAT THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING YOUR UNCHANGING BEAUTY ON WHICH TO FEAST MY EYES GIVES ME A JOY THAT GROWS WITH EVERY GLANCE THERE IS A GRACE AND DIGNITY IN THE LINES OF YOUR FACE
WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN IN PERFECT TRUST AND MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF GIVING VARIETY TO THE INFINITE THIS IS THE TASK SET BEFORE EVERY TRUE WIFE THE ANSWER BEGINS TO DAWN ON ME AND I SHALL NOT REST TILL I HAVE MADE IT MINE
EVERY WITCHERY OF IMAGINATION OF PASSION OF RELUCTANCE OVERCOME OF THE IDEAL PASSING INTO REALITY PLAYED ITS PART YET IN SPITE OF ALL THIS ENCHANTMENT I ONCE MORE STOOD OUT FOR MY COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE
NOT COUNTING HOUSE AND LANDS QUITE A CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE IN PROVENCE HIS WORTHY FATHER HAD BOUGHT ON THE VERY EVE OF THE CHEVALIER'S RETURN A FINE BUT BADLY MANAGED ESTATE WHERE HE DESIGNS TO PLANT TEN THOUSAND MULBERRY TREES
THE IMPORTANT POINT OF SEPARATING MARRIAGE FROM MARITAL RIGHTS WAS SETTLED IN A CONVERSATION BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE GAVE PROOF OF AN EXCELLENT TEMPER AND A TENDER HEART
AFTER SUCCESSFULLY ELUDING THE CONSCRIPTION HE WAS FORCED TO SEND HIM TO THE ARMY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN TO JOIN THE EMPEROR'S BODYGUARD AFTER LEIPSIC NO MORE WAS HEARD OF HIM
THE BARON A VERY PIOUS OLD MAN PRACTISED THAT FINE THEOLOGICAL VIRTUE WHICH WE USED TO CULTIVATE AT BLOIS HOPE
OH OUR DEFERENCE AND PROPRIETY ARE QUITE DISQUIETING I ASSURE YOU THERE I AM OFF AGAIN GOOD BYE DEAR P S I HAVE JUST OPENED YOUR THIRD LETTER
IT WAS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT I AMONG THE REST OF MY NEIGHBOURS HEARD IN ORDINARY DISCOURSE THAT THE PLAGUE WAS RETURNED AGAIN IN HOLLAND
UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE WERE FIFTY DIED THAT WEEK OF THE PLAGUE THE NEXT BILL WAS FROM THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY TO THE THIRTIETH WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE PLAGUE WAS SEVENTEEN BUT
IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WRITTEN BY A CITIZEN WHO CONTINUED ALL THE WHILE IN LONDON NEVER MADE PUBLIC BEFORE
TO GET PASSES AND CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH FOR SUCH AS TRAVELLED ABROAD FOR WITHOUT THESE THERE WAS NO BEING ADMITTED TO PASS THROUGH THE TOWNS UPON THE ROAD OR TO LODGE IN ANY INN
OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
I OBEYED THIS LAY CLOSE TO ME AND MY MIND SEEMED MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED TO STAY THAN EVER AND SUPPORTED WITH A SECRET SATISFACTION THAT I SHOULD BE KEPT ADD TO THIS THAT
WAS SUCH THAT THE TOWN WAS COMPUTED TO HAVE IN IT ABOVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN EVER IT HELD BEFORE NAY SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO SAY IT HAD TWICE AS MANY BECAUSE
SAINT BRIDE'S SIX SAINT JAMES'S NINE
THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
IN HIM WILL I TRUST SURELY HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND FROM THE NOISOME PESTILENCE HE SHALL COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS AND UNDER HIS WINGS SHALT THOU TRUST
AND AS ALL TOGETHER REGARD THE QUESTION BEFORE HIM AND THEN I THINK HE MAY SAFELY TAKE THEM FOR INTIMATIONS FROM HEAVEN OF WHAT IS HIS UNQUESTIONED DUTY TO DO IN SUCH A CASE I MEAN
AND THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE MONARCHY BEING RESTORED HAD FLOCKED TO LONDON TO SETTLE IN BUSINESS OR TO DEPEND UPON AND ATTEND THE COURT FOR REWARDS OF SERVICES PREFERMENTS AND THE LIKE
WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AND IN WHICH WAS EMBARKED ALL MY EFFECTS IN THE WORLD AND THE OTHER WAS THE PRESERVATION OF MY LIFE IN SO DISMAL A CALAMITY AS I SAW APPARENTLY WAS COMING UPON THE WHOLE CITY AND WHICH
SAINT BRIDE'S EIGHT
THE WOMAN BEING TAKEN ILL WITH WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO ENTRUST MY HOUSE AND ALL MY AFFAIRS
AND AT THAT JUNCTURE I HAPPENED TO STOP TURNING OVER THE BOOK
TO NOTE WHAT BECAME OF ME I HAD TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BEFORE ME
AND OF THE LAST THE BILL ITSELF SAID
THERE DIED BUT THREE OF WHICH NOT ONE WITHIN THE WHOLE CITY OR LIBERTIES AND SAINT ANDREW'S BURIED BUT FIFTEEN WHICH WAS VERY LOW
YET BEING VERY ILL BOTH IN MY HEAD AND IN MY STOMACH I WAS NOT WITHOUT APPREHENSION THAT I REALLY WAS INFECTED BUT IN ABOUT THREE DAYS I GREW BETTER THE THIRD NIGHT I RESTED WELL
THIS HURRY I SAY CONTINUED SOME WEEKS THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS RUMOURED THAT AN ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED OUT
ALL THE RUINED FAMILIES OF THE ROYAL PARTY FLOCKED HITHER ALL THE OLD SOLDIERS SET UP TRADES HERE AND ABUNDANCE OF FAMILIES SETTLED HERE AGAIN
AND HARDLY ANYTHING OF REFORMATION THOUGH THEY DID NOT WANT BEING TOLD THAT THEIR CRYING VICES MIGHT WITHOUT BREACH OF CHARITY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE FAR IN BRINGING THAT TERRIBLE JUDGEMENT UPON THE WHOLE NATION
SO THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM EXTRAORDINARY AND I OUGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT DID NOT EVIDENTLY POINT OUT OR INTIMATE TO ME THAT IT WAS THE WILL OF HEAVEN I SHOULD NOT GO
THERE WAS NONE OF THE PLAGUE AND BUT FOUR OF THE SPOTTED FEVER BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT RETURNED AGAIN AND THE DISTEMPER WAS SPREAD INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER PARISHES
THEY WOULD GO UNCONCERNED INTO INFECTED PLACES AND CONVERSE WITH INFECTED PERSONS BY WHICH MEANS THEY DIED AT THE RATE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND A WEEK
WITHOUT ANY OVERSEER OR PERSON FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH THEM HAD BEEN TO HAZARD THE LOSS NOT ONLY OF MY TRADE BUT OF MY GOODS AND INDEED OF ALL I HAD IN THE WORLD I HAD AN ELDER BROTHER
AND IT WAS PRINTED IN THE WEEKLY BILL OF MORTALITY IN THE USUAL MANNER THUS PLAGUE TWO PARISHES INFECTED ONE
AND IT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ESPECIALLY AND IN CLARKENWELL SO THAT BY THE SECOND WEEK IN AUGUST CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ALONE BURIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND CLARKENWELL
CONCERNING MY OWN CASE AND HOW I SHOULD DISPOSE OF MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY WHETHER I SHOULD RESOLVE TO STAY IN LONDON OR SHUT UP MY HOUSE AND FLEE AS MANY OF MY NEIGHBOURS DID I HAVE SET THIS PARTICULAR DOWN
MAGISTRATES AND SERVANTS LEFT IN THE CITY AS THEY FLED NOW OUT OF THE CITY SO I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT THE COURT REMOVED EARLY
I SAY AS MANY DID BECAUSE SEVERAL DID SO AT LAST ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ARMIES IN THE WAR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MANY YEARS PAST AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT SPEAKING OF SECOND CAUSES
I OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIM WHO HAVING BEEN MY MAKER HAD AN UNDISPUTED RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN DISPOSING OF ME AND THAT THEN THERE HAD BEEN
AS OTHERS RETIRED REALLY FRIGHTED WITH THE DISTEMPER IT WAS A MERE DESOLATING OF SOME OF THE STREETS BUT THE FRIGHT WAS NOT YET NEAR SO GREAT IN THE CITY ABSTRACTLY SO CALLED
THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
WHAT WAS MY DUTY TO DO AND I STATED THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH MY BROTHER HAD PRESSED ME TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND I SET AGAINST THEM THE STRONG IMPRESSIONS WHICH I HAD ON MY MIND FOR STAYING THE VISIBLE CALL I SEEMED TO HAVE
BUT WE PERCEIVED THE INFECTION KEPT CHIEFLY IN THE OUT PARISHES WHICH BEING VERY POPULOUS AND FULLER ALSO OF POOR THE DISTEMPER FOUND MORE TO PREY UPON THAN IN THE CITY
THAT IF I HAD BEEN A STRANGER AND AT A LOSS FOR MY WAY I MIGHT SOMETIMES HAVE GONE THE LENGTH OF A WHOLE STREET I MEAN OF THE BY STREETS AND SEEN NOBODY TO DIRECT ME
TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
AND IT WAS MEET HE SHOULD DO WITH ME AS SHOULD SEEM GOOD TO HIM WITH THIS RESOLUTION I WENT TO BED
FROM THE BEGINNING OF APRIL ESPECIALLY THEY STOOD AT TWENTY FIVE EACH WEEK TILL THE WEEK FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE TWENTY FIFTH
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WENT TO OXFORD WHERE IT PLEASED GOD TO PRESERVE THEM AND THE DISTEMPER DID NOT AS I HEARD OF SO MUCH AS TOUCH THEM FOR WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT
THIS HURRY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SUCH FOR SOME WEEKS THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DOOR WITHOUT EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SUCH PRESSING AND CROWDING THERE
COACHES FILLED WITH PEOPLE OF THE BETTER SORT AND HORSEMEN ATTENDING THEM AND ALL HURRYING AWAY THEN EMPTY WAGGONS AND CARTS APPEARED AND SPARE HORSES WITH SERVANTS WHO IT WAS APPARENT
IN ONE WEEK SINCE THE PRECEDING VISITATION OF SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX HOWEVER ALL THIS WENT OFF AGAIN AND THE WEATHER PROVING COLD AND THE FROST WHICH BEGAN IN DECEMBER
FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
AND AS I HAD ALREADY PREPARED EVERYTHING AS WELL AS I COULD AS TO MY BUSINESS AND WHOM TO ENTRUST MY AFFAIRS WITH I HAD LITTLE TO DO BUT TO RESOLVE I WENT HOME THAT EVENING GREATLY OPPRESSED IN MY MIND
SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
YET THERE WAS FOURTEEN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER AS WELL AS FOURTEEN OF THE PLAGUE
BUT THIS WAS ALL KNAVERY AND COLLUSION
MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
WHEREAS THE EUROPEANS OR CHRISTIAN MERCHANTS WHO KEPT THEMSELVES RETIRED AND RESERVED GENERALLY ESCAPED THE CONTAGION UPON THESE ARGUMENTS MY BROTHER CHANGED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN
AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
BUT THEY WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT STREET NEITHER ON ONE SIDE
OR RATHER AT THE UPPER END OF DRURY LANE
THAT WOULD SURROUND ME AND THAT IF I ATTEMPTED TO SECURE MYSELF BY FLEEING FROM MY HABITATION AND ACTED CONTRARY TO THESE INTIMATIONS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE DIVINE IT WAS A KIND OF
AMONG THE WEALTHIEST OF THE PEOPLE AND SUCH PEOPLE AS WERE UNENCUMBERED WITH TRADES AND BUSINESS BUT OF THE REST THE GENERALITY STAYED AND SEEMED TO ABIDE THE WORST SO THAT
FOR SAYS HE IS IT NOT AS REASONABLE THAT YOU SHOULD TRUST GOD WITH THE CHANCE OR RISK OF LOSING YOUR TRADE AS THAT YOU SHOULD STAY IN SO EMINENT A POINT OF DANGER AND TRUST HIM WITH YOUR LIFE I COULD NOT
BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
FROM THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY CALLING AND THE CARE DUE FROM ME FOR THE PRESERVATION OF MY EFFECTS WHICH WERE AS I MIGHT SAY MY ESTATE ALSO THE INTIMATIONS WHICH I THOUGHT
BECAUSE THOU HAST MADE THE LORD WHICH IS MY REFUGE EVEN THE MOST HIGH THY HABITATION THERE SHALL NO EVIL BEFALL THEE NEITHER SHALL ANY PLAGUE COME NIGH THY DWELLING
THAT ANY SHOULD HAVE HEARTS SO HARDENED IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A CALAMITY AS TO ROB AND STEAL YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT ALL SORTS OF VILLAINIES AND EVEN LEVITIES AND DEBAUCHERIES
A LITTLE HARDENED IT IS TRUE A VAST MANY PEOPLE FLED AS I HAVE OBSERVED YET THEY WERE CHIEFLY FROM THE WEST END OF THE TOWN AND FROM THAT WE CALL THE HEART OF THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY
TWENTY MORE WHO WERE REALLY DEAD OF THE PLAGUE IN THAT PARISH BUT HAD BEEN SET DOWN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER OR OTHER DISTEMPERS BESIDES OTHERS CONCEALED
AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
HAD MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT TRAVELLED DONE SO THE PLAGUE HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED INTO SO MANY COUNTRY TOWNS AND HOUSES AS IT WAS TO THE GREAT DAMAGE AND INDEED TO THE RUIN OF ABUNDANCE OF PEOPLE
SAINT JAMES'S SEVEN
HE WAS AS ABLE TO KEEP ME IN A TIME OF THE INFECTION AS IN A TIME OF HEALTH AND IF HE DID NOT THINK FIT TO DELIVER ME STILL I WAS IN HIS HANDS
ONLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT HIRE A HORSE TO GO OR MY FELLOW WAS RUN AWAY THAT WAS TO ATTEND ME WAS RIDICULOUS SINCE AT THE TIME I HAD MY HEALTH AND LIMBS AND OTHER SERVANTS AND MIGHT
AND I BEGAN TO RESOLVE TO GO AND ACCORDINGLY MADE ALL THINGS READY FOR IN SHORT THE INFECTION INCREASED ROUND ME
AND IN THE SUBURBS IN SOUTHWARK AND IN THE EAST PART SUCH AS WAPPING RATCLIFF STEPNEY ROTHERHITHE AND THE LIKE THE PEOPLE GENERALLY STAYED EXCEPT HERE AND THERE A FEW WEALTHY FAMILIES WHO AS ABOVE
SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
IT WAS NOW MID JULY AND THE PLAGUE WHICH HAD CHIEFLY RAGED AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN AND AS I SAID BEFORE IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN
AT THE SAME TIME IN LONDON AND NOT MANY YEARS BEFORE COME OVER FROM PORTUGAL AND ADVISING WITH HIM HIS ANSWER WAS IN THREE WORDS
SAINT JAMES'S SIX BESIDES THIS IT WAS OBSERVED WITH GREAT UNEASINESS BY THE PEOPLE THAT THE WEEKLY BILLS IN GENERAL INCREASED VERY MUCH DURING THESE WEEKS ALTHOUGH IT WAS AT A TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN
NOW AS THERE HAD NONE DIED IN THE CITY FOR ALL THIS TIME MY LORD MAYOR GAVE CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY TO ALL THOSE WHO LIVED IN THE NINETY SEVEN PARISHES AND TO THOSE WITHIN THE LIBERTIES TOO
IT WAS BROUGHT SOME SAID FROM ITALY OTHERS FROM THE LEVANT AMONG SOME GOODS WHICH WERE BROUGHT HOME BY THEIR TURKEY FLEET OTHERS SAID IT WAS BROUGHT FROM CANDIA OTHERS FROM CYPRUS
AND IN OTHER PLACES WHERE HE HAD BEEN FOR MY BROTHER BEING A MERCHANT WAS A FEW YEARS BEFORE AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED RETURNED FROM ABROAD COMING LAST FROM LISBON AND HOW
WERE RETURNING OR SENT FROM THE COUNTRIES TO FETCH MORE PEOPLE BESIDES INNUMERABLE NUMBERS OF MEN ON HORSEBACK SOME ALONE OTHERS WITH SERVANTS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING
AND WOULD BE DIRECTED WHAT TO DO IN IT NAMELY THAT HE SHOULD KEEP HIS EYE UPON THE PARTICULAR PROVIDENCES WHICH OCCUR AT THAT TIME AND LOOK UPON THEM COMPLEXLY AS THEY REGARD ONE ANOTHER
MY TRADE WAS A SADDLER AND AS MY DEALINGS WERE CHIEFLY NOT BY A SHOP OR CHANCE TRADE BUT AMONG THE MERCHANTS TRADING TO THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA SO MY EFFECTS LAY VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF SUCH
IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AND THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN IN WHITECHAPPEL THAT IS TO SAY THE BROAD STREET WHERE I LIVED INDEED NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT WAGGONS AND CARTS WITH GOODS
NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALREADY INFECTED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MAY YET THE WEATHER WAS TEMPERATE VARIABLE AND COOL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE HAD STILL SOME HOPES THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED THEM WAS THAT THE CITY WAS HEALTHY
SWEATED A LITTLE AND WAS MUCH REFRESHED THE APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING THE INFECTION WENT ALSO QUITE AWAY WITH MY ILLNESS AND I WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS AS USUAL
ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT AS IT HAD GOTTEN SOME VENT IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE SECRETARIES OF STATE GOT KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND CONCERNING THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN OF THE TRUTH
MANUFACTURERS AND THE LIKE
I READ ON TO THE SEVENTH VERSE EXCLUSIVE AND AFTER THAT INCLUDED THE TENTH AS FOLLOWS I WILL SAY OF THE LORD HE IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS MY GOD
BUT I HAD A FAMILY OF SERVANTS WHOM I KEPT AT MY BUSINESS HAD A HOUSE SHOP AND WAREHOUSES FILLED WITH GOODS AND IN SHORT TO LEAVE THEM ALL AS THINGS IN SUCH A CASE MUST BE LEFT THAT IS TO SAY
YET THERE DIED NO MORE OF THE PLAGUE ON THE WHOLE SOUTHWARK SIDE OF THE WATER THAN SIXTEEN BUT THIS FACE OF THINGS SOON CHANGED
FLYING FROM GOD AND THAT HE COULD CAUSE HIS JUSTICE TO OVERTAKE ME WHEN AND WHERE HE THOUGHT FIT THESE THOUGHTS QUITE TURNED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN AND WHEN I CAME TO DISCOURSE WITH MY BROTHER AGAIN
IRRESOLUTE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I HAD SET THE EVENING WHOLLY APART TO CONSIDER SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT AND WAS ALL ALONE FOR ALREADY PEOPLE HAD AS IT WERE BY A GENERAL CONSENT
SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
ABOUT THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BEING FROM HEAVEN I MENTION THIS STORY ALSO AS THE BEST METHOD I CAN ADVISE ANY PERSON TO TAKE IN SUCH A CASE ESPECIALLY IF HE BE ONE THAT MAKES CONSCIENCE OF HIS DUTY
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE ORDINARY BURIALS INCREASED IN NUMBER CONSIDERABLY FOR EXAMPLE FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TO JANUARY THIRD
SO FULLY BECAUSE I KNOW NOT BUT IT MAY BE OF MOMENT TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER ME IF THEY COME TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SAME DISTRESS AND TO THE SAME MANNER OF MAKING THEIR CHOICE AND THEREFORE
AND SEVERAL COUNCILS WERE HELD ABOUT WAYS TO PREVENT ITS COMING OVER BUT ALL WAS KEPT VERY PRIVATE HENCE IT WAS THAT THIS RUMOUR DIED OFF AGAIN AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO FORGET IT AS A THING WE WERE VERY LITTLE CONCERNED IN
FOR IF ANY ONE COMPLAINED IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SAID HE HAD THE PLAGUE
AS ANYONE MIGHT PERCEIVE BY THEIR APPEARANCE THIS WAS A VERY TERRIBLE AND MELANCHOLY THING TO SEE AND AS IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT BUT LOOK ON FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
AS I WAS THAT I OUGHT INDEED TO SUBMIT TO IT AS A WORK OF HEAVEN IF I HAD BEEN ANY WAY DISABLED BY DISTEMPERS OR DISEASES AND THAT THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO GO
AND HAVING THE KEY IN MY POCKET I USED TO GO INTO THE HOUSE AND OVER MOST OF THE ROOMS TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL FOR THOUGH IT BE SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO TELL
OF ALL DISTEMPERS WHEREOF IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DIED OF THE PLAGUE YET THERE WAS BUT TWENTY EIGHT IN THE WHOLE CITY WITHIN THE WALLS AND BUT NINETEEN IN SOUTHWARK
WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
AND AFTERWARDS FETCHED A ROUND FARTHER INTO BUCKINGHAMSHIRE OR BEDFORDSHIRE TO A RETREAT HE HAD FOUND OUT THERE FOR HIS FAMILY IT WAS A VERY ILL TIME TO BE SICK IN
AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOUGH THEY WERE AT FIRST IN A MOST INEXPRESSIBLE CONSTERNATION YET AS I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE DISTEMPER INTERMITTED OFTEN AT FIRST SO THEY WERE AS IT WERE
TO LONDON I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT AS JERUSALEM WAS BESIEGED BY THE ROMANS WHEN THE JEWS WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER BY WHICH MEANS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED THERE
HOWEVER GREAT IT WAS MY FEARS PERHAPS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE'S REPRESENTED TO BE MUCH GREATER THAN IT COULD BE
TWO PHYSICIANS AND A SURGEON WERE ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND MAKE INSPECTION THIS THEY DID AND FINDING EVIDENT TOKENS OF THE SICKNESS UPON BOTH THE BODIES THAT WERE DEAD
A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
I TOLD HIM THAT I INCLINED TO STAY AND TAKE MY LOT IN THAT STATION IN WHICH GOD HAD PLACED ME AND THAT IT SEEMED TO BE MADE MORE ESPECIALLY MY DUTY ON THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID
THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR THE PLAGUE WAS TO RUN AWAY FROM IT AS TO MY ARGUMENT OF LOSING MY TRADE MY GOODS OR DEBTS HE QUITE CONFUTED ME HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING WHICH
HIS PROSPECTS LESS DESPERATE HE WAS STILL YOUNG HE WAS ONLY FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY HE HAD NEARLY FIFTY YEARS TO LIVE WHAT UNFORSEEN EVENTS MIGHT NOT OPEN HIS PRISON DOOR AND RESTORE HIM TO LIBERTY
HE MOVED AWAY WALKED UP AND DOWN HIS CELL TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS AND THEN WENT BACK AND LISTENED THE MATTER WAS NO LONGER DOUBTFUL SOMETHING WAS AT WORK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL
HE SIGHED FOR THE GALLEYS WITH THE INFAMOUS COSTUME THE CHAIN AND THE BRAND ON THE SHOULDER THE GALLEY SLAVES BREATHED THE FRESH AIR OF HEAVEN AND SAW EACH OTHER THEY WERE VERY HAPPY HE BESOUGHT THE JAILER ONE DAY TO LET HIM HAVE A COMPANION WERE IT EVEN THE MAD ABBE
HE LET THE JUG FALL ON THE FLOOR AND IT BROKE IN PIECES DANTES CONCEALED TWO OR THREE OF THE SHARPEST FRAGMENTS IN HIS BED LEAVING THE REST ON THE FLOOR THE BREAKING OF HIS JUG WAS TOO NATURAL AN ACCIDENT TO EXCITE SUSPICION EDMOND HAD ALL THE NIGHT TO WORK IN
IF ON THE CONTRARY IT IS A PRISONER THE NOISE I MAKE WILL ALARM HIM HE WILL CEASE AND NOT BEGIN AGAIN UNTIL HE THINKS EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP EDMOND ROSE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME HIS LEGS DID NOT TREMBLE AND HIS SIGHT WAS CLEAR
AT FIRST GAYLY THEN WITH DELIBERATION AND AT LAST WITH REGRET NOTHING BUT THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS OATH GAVE HIM STRENGTH TO PROCEED
WHEN THE JAILER MOVED HIS BED AND STOOPED TO EXAMINE THE OPENING HE WOULD KILL HIM WITH HIS WATER JUG HE WOULD BE CONDEMNED TO DIE BUT HE WAS ABOUT TO DIE OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR WHEN THIS MIRACULOUS NOISE RECALLED HIM TO LIFE THE JAILER CAME IN THE EVENING
HE WAS SUSTAINED AT FIRST BY THAT PRIDE OF CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE WHICH IS THE SEQUENCE TO HOPE THEN HE BEGAN TO DOUBT HIS OWN INNOCENCE WHICH JUSTIFIED IN SOME MEASURE THE GOVERNOR'S BELIEF IN HIS MENTAL ALIENATION AND THEN RELAXING HIS SENTIMENT OF PRIDE
OR THE PUNISHMENT THAT POSSIBLY WILL FOLLOW THERE IS A SORT OF CONSOLATION AT THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE YAWNING ABYSS AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH LIE DARKNESS AND OBSCURITY EDMOND FOUND SOME SOLACE IN THESE IDEAS
AT THE END OF THE SECOND HE HAD CEASED TO MARK THE LAPSE OF TIME DANTES SAID I WISH TO DIE AND HAD CHOSEN THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH AND FEARFUL OF CHANGING HIS MIND HE HAD TAKEN AN OATH TO DIE
SOME HOURS AFTERWARDS IT BEGAN AGAIN NEARER AND MORE DISTINCT EDMOND WAS INTENSELY INTERESTED SUDDENLY THE JAILER ENTERED
THE PRISONER REPROACHED HIMSELF WITH NOT HAVING THUS EMPLOYED THE HOURS HE HAD PASSED IN VAIN HOPES PRAYER AND DESPONDENCY DURING THE SIX YEARS THAT HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED WHAT MIGHT HE NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
WHEN THE HOUR FOR HIS JAILER'S VISIT ARRIVED DANTES STRAIGHTENED THE HANDLE OF THE SAUCEPAN AS WELL AS HE COULD AND PLACED IT IN ITS ACCUSTOMED PLACE THE TURNKEY POURED HIS RATION OF SOUP INTO IT TOGETHER WITH THE FISH
AND IF PUNISHMENT WERE THE END IN VIEW OTHER TORTURES THAN DEATH MUST BE INVENTED HE BEGAN TO REFLECT ON SUICIDE UNHAPPY HE WHO ON THE BRINK OF MISFORTUNE BROODS OVER IDEAS LIKE THESE
IT IS WELL RETURNED THE VOICE TO MORROW
AND WEARYING THE PATIENCE OF HIS JAILER WHO OUT OF KINDNESS OF HEART HAD BROUGHT BROTH AND WHITE BREAD FOR HIS PRISONER FORTUNATELY HE FANCIED THAT DANTES WAS DELIRIOUS AND PLACING THE FOOD ON THE RICKETY TABLE HE WITHDREW
AS THE JAILER WAS VISITING HIM FOR THE LAST TIME THAT NIGHT
HE WENT TO A CORNER OF HIS DUNGEON DETACHED A STONE AND WITH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE WALL WHERE THE SOUND CAME HE STRUCK THRICE AT THE FIRST BLOW THE SOUND CEASED AS IF BY MAGIC EDMOND LISTENED INTENTLY AN HOUR PASSED
DANTES MIND HAD REVOLTED AT THE IDEA OF ASSEMBLAGES OF PRISONERS MADE UP OF THIEVES VAGABONDS AND MURDERERS HE NOW WISHED TO BE AMONGST THEM IN ORDER TO SEE SOME OTHER FACE BESIDES THAT OF HIS JAILER
AND WITHOUT EDUCATION HE COULD NOT THEREFORE IN THE SOLITUDE OF HIS DUNGEON TRAVERSE IN MENTAL VISION THE HISTORY OF THE AGES BRING TO LIFE THE NATIONS THAT HAD PERISHED
A SAILOR HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE SINCE THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN YOUR CRIME I AM INNOCENT
WHO TALKS OF GOD AND DESPAIR AT THE SAME TIME SAID A VOICE THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM BENEATH THE EARTH
IN THREE DAYS HE HAD SUCCEEDED WITH THE UTMOST PRECAUTION IN REMOVING THE CEMENT AND EXPOSING THE STONE WORK THE WALL WAS BUILT OF ROUGH STONES AMONG WHICH TO GIVE STRENGTH TO THE STRUCTURE BLOCKS OF HEWN STONE WERE AT INTERVALS IMBEDDED
HE RAPIDLY DEVOURED HIS FOOD AND AFTER WAITING AN HOUR LEST THE JAILER SHOULD CHANGE HIS MIND AND RETURN HE REMOVED HIS BED TOOK THE HANDLE OF THE SAUCEPAN INSERTED THE POINT BETWEEN THE HEWN STONE AND ROUGH STONES OF THE WALL AND EMPLOYED IT AS A LEVER
HIS ENERGETIC SPIRIT THAT WOULD HAVE EXALTED IN THUS REVISITING THE PAST WAS IMPRISONED LIKE AN EAGLE IN A CAGE HE CLUNG TO ONE IDEA THAT OF HIS HAPPINESS DESTROYED WITHOUT APPARENT CAUSE BY AN UNHEARD OF FATALITY
IT WAS EASY TO ASCERTAIN THIS BUT HOW COULD HE RISK THE QUESTION IT WAS EASY TO CALL HIS JAILER'S ATTENTION TO THE NOISE AND WATCH HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE LISTENED
ALAS MURMURED THE VOICE OH WHAT IS THE MATTER CRIED DANTES I HAVE MADE A MISTAKE OWING TO AN ERROR IN MY PLANS I TOOK THE WRONG ANGLE AND HAVE COME OUT FIFTEEN FEET FROM WHERE I INTENDED
I TOOK THE WALL YOU ARE MINING FOR THE OUTER WALL OF THE FORTRESS BUT THEN YOU WOULD BE CLOSE TO THE SEA THAT IS WHAT I HOPED AND SUPPOSING YOU HAD SUCCEEDED I SHOULD HAVE THROWN MYSELF INTO THE SEA
A FRENCHMAN YOUR NAME
PROPOSED TASKS TO ACCOMPLISH AND AT THE END OF EVERY PRAYER INTRODUCED THE ENTREATY OFTENER ADDRESSED TO MAN THAN TO GOD FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES AS WE FORGIVE THEM THAT TRESPASS AGAINST US
DANTES WAS ON HIS BED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THUS HE BETTER GUARDED THE UNFINISHED OPENING DOUBTLESS THERE WAS A STRANGE EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES FOR THE JAILER SAID COME ARE YOU GOING MAD AGAIN DANTES DID NOT ANSWER
DEVOURED IT SO TO SPEAK AS THE IMPLACABLE UGOLINO DEVOURS THE SKULL OF ARCHBISHOP ROGER IN THE INFERNO OF DANTE RAGE SUPPLANTED RELIGIOUS FERVOR
AND DURING THE FOUR DAYS THAT HE HAD BEEN CARRYING OUT HIS PURPOSE EDMOND HAD NOT SPOKEN TO THE ATTENDANT HAD NOT ANSWERED HIM WHEN HE INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL WHEN HE LOOKED TOO CURIOUSLY AT HIM
DANTES HEARD JOYFULLY THE KEY GRATE IN THE LOCK HE LISTENED UNTIL THE SOUND OF STEPS DIED AWAY AND THEN HASTILY DISPLACING HIS BED SAW BY THE FAINT LIGHT THAT PENETRATED INTO HIS CELL
HE LISTENED ALL WAS SILENT AS IT HAD BEEN FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS DANTES SIGHED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS NEIGHBOR DISTRUSTED HIM HOWEVER HE TOILED ON ALL THE NIGHT WITHOUT BEING DISCOURAGED
BUT HE WENT ON ASKING ALL THE SAME HE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SPEAKING TO THE NEW JAILER ALTHOUGH THE LATTER WAS IF POSSIBLE MORE TACITURN THAN THE OLD ONE BUT STILL TO SPEAK TO A MAN EVEN THOUGH MUTE WAS SOMETHING
ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT I WAS JUST NINETEEN WHEN I WAS ARRESTED THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN NOT QUITE TWENTY SIX MURMURED THE VOICE AT THAT AGE HE CANNOT BE A TRAITOR
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HEAVEN HAD AT LENGTH TAKEN PITY ON HIM AND HAD SENT THIS NOISE TO WARN HIM ON THE VERY BRINK OF THE ABYSS PERHAPS ONE OF THOSE BELOVED ONES HE HAD SO OFTEN THOUGHT OF WAS THINKING OF HIM
HE FEARED THAT THE EMOTION OF HIS VOICE WOULD BETRAY HIM THE JAILER WENT AWAY SHAKING HIS HEAD NIGHT CAME DANTES HOPED THAT HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD PROFIT BY THE SILENCE TO ADDRESS HIM BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER
DANTES UTTERED BLASPHEMIES THAT MADE HIS JAILER RECOIL WITH HORROR DASHED HIMSELF FURIOUSLY AGAINST THE WALLS OF HIS PRISON WREAKED HIS ANGER UPON EVERYTHING AND CHIEFLY UPON HIMSELF
HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS THE ENMITY OF MAN AND NOT THE VENGEANCE OF HEAVEN THAT HAD THUS PLUNGED HIM INTO THE DEEPEST MISERY HE CONSIGNED HIS UNKNOWN PERSECUTORS TO THE MOST HORRIBLE TORTURES HE COULD IMAGINE AND FOUND THEM ALL INSUFFICIENT
SO THAT THE LEAST THING A GRAIN OF SAND A STRAW OR A BREATH OF AIR THAT ANNOYED HIM LED TO PAROXYSMS OF FURY THEN THE LETTER THAT VILLEFORT HAD SHOWED TO HIM RECURRED TO HIS MIND
THE DAY PASSED AWAY IN UTTER SILENCE NIGHT CAME WITHOUT RECURRENCE OF THE NOISE IT IS A PRISONER SAID EDMOND JOYFULLY THE NIGHT PASSED IN PERFECT SILENCE EDMOND DID NOT CLOSE HIS EYES
NOW WHEN EVENING CAME DANTES PUT HIS PLATE ON THE GROUND NEAR THE DOOR THE JAILER AS HE ENTERED STEPPED ON IT AND BROKE IT
IF IT IS A WORKMAN I NEED BUT KNOCK AGAINST THE WALL AND HE WILL CEASE TO WORK IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHO IS KNOCKING AND WHY HE DOES SO BUT AS HIS OCCUPATION IS SANCTIONED BY THE GOVERNOR HE WILL SOON RESUME IT
HE WAS WRONG TO LEAVE IT THERE BUT THE JAILER WAS WRONG NOT TO HAVE LOOKED BEFORE HIM THE JAILER THEREFORE ONLY GRUMBLED THEN HE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SOMETHING TO POUR THE SOUP INTO DANTES ENTIRE DINNER SERVICE CONSISTED OF ONE PLATE THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE
PUSHED HIS BED AGAINST THE WALL AND LAY DOWN THE BREAKFAST CONSISTED OF A PIECE OF BREAD THE JAILER ENTERED AND PLACED THE BREAD ON THE TABLE WELL DON'T YOU INTEND TO BRING ME ANOTHER PLATE SAID DANTES NO REPLIED THE TURNKEY
AND A JAILER IS NO MAN TO A PRISONER HE IS A LIVING DOOR A BARRIER OF FLESH AND BLOOD ADDING STRENGTH TO RESTRAINTS OF OAK AND IRON
THE JAILER ALWAYS BROUGHT DANTES SOUP IN AN IRON SAUCEPAN THIS SAUCEPAN CONTAINED SOUP FOR BOTH PRISONERS
OR WHETHER THE NOISE WAS REALLY LOUDER THAN USUAL EDMOND RAISED HIS HEAD AND LISTENED IT WAS A CONTINUAL SCRATCHING AS IF MADE BY A HUGE CLAW A POWERFUL TOOTH OR SOME IRON INSTRUMENT ATTACKING THE STONES
THE WINDOW GRATING WAS OF IRON BUT HE HAD TOO OFTEN ASSURED HIMSELF OF ITS SOLIDITY ALL HIS FURNITURE CONSISTED OF A BED A CHAIR A TABLE A PAIL AND A JUG THE BED HAD IRON CLAMPS BUT THEY WERE SCREWED TO THE WOOD
YES SAID DANTES HE WILL NOT RETURN UNTIL THE EVENING SO THAT WE HAVE TWELVE HOURS BEFORE US I CAN WORK THEN SAID THE VOICE OH YES YES THIS INSTANT I ENTREAT YOU IN A MOMENT THAT PART OF THE FLOOR ON WHICH DANTES WAS RESTING HIS TWO HANDS
WHO DID NOT GUESS HE HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY A CAPTIVE AS ANXIOUS FOR LIBERTY AS HIMSELF THREE DAYS PASSED SEVENTY TWO LONG TEDIOUS HOURS WHICH HE COUNTED OFF BY MINUTES AT LENGTH ONE EVENING
I HAVE SEEN THE HEAVENS OVERCAST THE SEA RAGE AND FOAM THE STORM ARISE AND LIKE A MONSTROUS BIRD BEATING THE TWO HORIZONS WITH ITS WINGS THEN I FELT THAT MY VESSEL WAS A VAIN REFUGE THAT TREMBLED AND SHOOK BEFORE THE TEMPEST
AND DISCOVERED A NEW MEANING IN EVERY WORD FOR IN PROSPERITY PRAYERS SEEM BUT A MERE MEDLEY OF WORDS UNTIL MISFORTUNE COMES AND THE UNHAPPY SUFFERER FIRST UNDERSTANDS THE MEANING
DANTES TOLD HIM THAT THE JUG HAD FALLEN FROM HIS HANDS WHILE HE WAS DRINKING AND THE JAILER WENT GRUMBLINGLY TO FETCH ANOTHER WITHOUT GIVING HIMSELF THE TROUBLE TO REMOVE THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BROKEN ONE HE RETURNED SPEEDILY ADVISED THE PRISONER TO BE MORE CAREFUL AND DEPARTED
AFTER HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF MY LIBERTY AFTER HAVING DEPRIVED ME OF DEATH AFTER HAVING RECALLED ME TO EXISTENCE MY GOD HAVE PITY ON ME AND DO NOT LET ME DIE IN DESPAIR
YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY WHEN YOU BRING ME MY BREAKFAST THIS ADVICE WAS TO THE JAILER'S TASTE AS IT SPARED HIM THE NECESSITY OF MAKING ANOTHER TRIP HE LEFT THE SAUCEPAN
BUT AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR HE HAD SCRAPED OFF A HANDFUL A MATHEMATICIAN MIGHT HAVE CALCULATED THAT IN TWO YEARS SUPPOSING THAT THE ROCK WAS NOT ENCOUNTERED A PASSAGE TWENTY FEET LONG AND TWO FEET BROAD MIGHT BE FORMED
AND HE LAID THE REQUEST OF NUMBER THIRTY FOUR BEFORE THE GOVERNOR BUT THE LATTER SAPIENTLY IMAGINED THAT DANTES WISHED TO CONSPIRE OR ATTEMPT AN ESCAPE AND REFUSED HIS REQUEST DANTES HAD EXHAUSTED ALL HUMAN RESOURCES
HE HAD NOT SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO RISE AND CAST HIS SUPPER OUT OF THE LOOPHOLE THE NEXT MORNING HE COULD NOT SEE OR HEAR THE JAILER FEARED HE WAS DANGEROUSLY ILL EDMOND HOPED HE WAS DYING THUS THE DAY PASSED AWAY
AND REBUILD THE ANCIENT CITIES SO VAST AND STUPENDOUS IN THE LIGHT OF THE IMAGINATION AND THAT PASS BEFORE THE EYE GLOWING WITH CELESTIAL COLORS IN MARTIN'S BABYLONIAN PICTURES HE COULD NOT DO THIS HE WHOSE PAST LIFE WAS SO SHORT
HE ADDRESSED HIS SUPPLICATIONS NOT TO GOD BUT TO MAN GOD IS ALWAYS THE LAST RESOURCE UNFORTUNATES WHO OUGHT TO BEGIN WITH GOD DO NOT HAVE ANY HOPE IN HIM TILL THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER MEANS OF DELIVERANCE
ON A LEVEL WITH THE FLOOR HOW IS IT CONCEALED BEHIND MY BED HAS YOUR BED BEEN MOVED SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN A PRISONER NO WHAT DOES YOUR CHAMBER OPEN ON A CORRIDOR AND THE CORRIDOR ON A COURT
HEAVEN WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME STRENGTH BUT NOW ALL IS LOST ALL YES STOP UP YOUR EXCAVATION CAREFULLY DO NOT WORK ANY MORE AND WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME TELL ME AT LEAST WHO YOU ARE I AM
FOR THE EMPEROR'S RETURN THE EMPEROR IS NO LONGER ON THE THRONE THEN HE ABDICATED AT FONTAINEBLEAU IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN AND WAS SENT TO THE ISLAND OF ELBA BUT HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE THAT YOU ARE IGNORANT OF ALL THIS
BECAUSE AFTER TORTURE CAME DEATH AND AFTER DEATH IF NOT REPOSE AT LEAST THE BOON OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY DINT OF CONSTANTLY DWELLING ON THE IDEA THAT TRANQUILLITY WAS DEATH
DANTES SPOKE FOR THE SAKE OF HEARING HIS OWN VOICE HE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK WHEN ALONE BUT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TERRIFIED HIM OFTEN BEFORE HIS CAPTIVITY
EDMOND'S HAIR STOOD ON END AND HE ROSE TO HIS KNEES AH SAID HE I HEAR A HUMAN VOICE EDMOND HAD NOT HEARD ANY ONE SPEAK SAVE HIS JAILER FOR FOUR OR FIVE YEARS
JUST AS HE REMOVED HIS BED FROM THE WALL HE HEARD THREE KNOCKS HE THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES IS IT YOU SAID HE I AM HERE IS YOUR JAILER GONE
AND LOOKING FORWARD WITH TERROR TO HIS FUTURE EXISTENCE CHOSE THAT MIDDLE LINE THAT SEEMED TO AFFORD HIM A REFUGE SOMETIMES SAID HE IN MY VOYAGES WHEN I WAS A MAN AND COMMANDED OTHER MEN
I HAVE A FATHER WHO IS SEVENTY IF HE YET LIVES I ONLY LOVE HIM AND A YOUNG GIRL CALLED MERCEDES MY FATHER HAS NOT YET FORGOTTEN ME I AM SURE BUT GOD ALONE KNOWS IF SHE LOVES ME STILL I SHALL LOVE YOU AS I LOVED MY FATHER
EDMOND HEARD A HOLLOW SOUND IN THE WALL AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LYING SO MANY LOATHSOME ANIMALS INHABITED THE PRISON THAT THEIR NOISE DID NOT IN GENERAL AWAKE HIM BUT WHETHER ABSTINENCE HAD QUICKENED HIS FACULTIES
FOR A CHANGE HOWEVER DISADVANTAGEOUS WAS STILL A CHANGE AND WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME AMUSEMENT HE ENTREATED TO BE ALLOWED TO WALK ABOUT TO HAVE FRESH AIR BOOKS AND WRITING MATERIALS HIS REQUESTS WERE NOT GRANTED
THEN HE RAISED TO HIS LIPS THE REPAST THAT LIKE A VOLUNTARY TANTALUS HE REFUSED HIMSELF BUT HE THOUGHT OF HIS OATH AND HE WOULD NOT BREAK IT HE PERSISTED UNTIL AT LAST
DANTES RAISED HIMSELF UP AND BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BAD QUALITY OF THE FOOD ABOUT THE COLDNESS OF HIS DUNGEON GRUMBLING AND COMPLAINING IN ORDER TO HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR SPEAKING LOUDER
CARRIED IT INTO THE CORNER OF HIS CELL AND COVERED IT WITH EARTH THEN WISHING TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF HIS TIME WHILE HE HAD THE MEANS OF LABOR HE CONTINUED TO WORK WITHOUT CEASING AT THE DAWN OF DAY HE REPLACED THE STONE
HE SOON FELT THAT HIS IDEAS BECAME AGAIN COLLECTED HE COULD THINK AND STRENGTHEN HIS THOUGHTS BY REASONING THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF I MUST PUT THIS TO THE TEST BUT WITHOUT COMPROMISING ANYBODY
BUT IN THE DARKNESS HE COULD NOT DO MUCH AND HE SOON FELT THAT HE WAS WORKING AGAINST SOMETHING VERY HARD HE PUSHED BACK HIS BED AND WAITED FOR DAY ALL NIGHT HE HEARD THE SUBTERRANEAN WORKMAN WHO CONTINUED TO MINE HIS WAY DAY CAME THE JAILER ENTERED
RESTORING VIGOR AND AGILITY TO HIS LIMBS BY EXERCISE AND SO PREPARING HIMSELF FOR HIS FUTURE DESTINY AT INTERVALS HE LISTENED TO LEARN IF THE NOISE HAD NOT BEGUN AGAIN AND GREW IMPATIENT AT THE PRUDENCE OF THE PRISONER
I HAVE LOST ALL THAT BOUND ME TO LIFE DEATH SMILES AND INVITES ME TO REPOSE I DIE AFTER MY OWN MANNER I DIE EXHAUSTED AND BROKEN SPIRITED AS I FALL ASLEEP WHEN I HAVE PACED THREE THOUSAND TIMES ROUND MY CELL
AND FOUND EXISTENCE ALMOST SUPPORTABLE BECAUSE HE FELT THAT HE COULD THROW IT OFF AT PLEASURE LIKE A WORN OUT GARMENT TWO METHODS OF SELF DESTRUCTION WERE AT HIS DISPOSAL HE COULD HANG HIMSELF WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO THE WINDOW BARS
SUDDENLY ANOTHER IDEA TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS MIND SO USED TO MISFORTUNE THAT IT WAS SCARCELY CAPABLE OF HOPE THE IDEA THAT THE NOISE WAS MADE BY WORKMEN THE GOVERNOR HAD ORDERED TO REPAIR THE NEIGHBORING DUNGEON
SINCE EIGHTEEN ELEVEN DANTES SHUDDERED THIS MAN HAD BEEN FOUR YEARS LONGER THAN HIMSELF IN PRISON DO NOT DIG ANY MORE SAID THE VOICE ONLY TELL ME HOW HIGH UP IS YOUR EXCAVATION
IF HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD NOT COME TO HIM HE WOULD GO TO HIS NEIGHBOR ALL DAY HE TOILED ON UNTIRINGLY AND BY THE EVENING HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN EXTRACTING TEN HANDFULS OF PLASTER AND FRAGMENTS OF STONE
AS HE KNELT WITH HIS HEAD IN THE OPENING SUDDENLY GAVE WAY HE DREW BACK SMARTLY WHILE A MASS OF STONES AND EARTH DISAPPEARED IN A HOLE THAT OPENED BENEATH THE APERTURE HE HIMSELF HAD FORMED
I SWEAR TO YOU BY HIM WHO DIED FOR US THAT NAUGHT SHALL INDUCE ME TO BREATHE ONE SYLLABLE TO MY JAILERS BUT I CONJURE YOU DO NOT ABANDON ME IF YOU DO I SWEAR TO YOU FOR I HAVE GOT TO THE END OF MY STRENGTH
OF HAVING CONSPIRED TO AID THE EMPEROR'S RETURN
THE PRISONER HAD DISCOVERED THE DANGER AND HAD SUBSTITUTED A LEVER FOR A CHISEL ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY EDMOND DETERMINED TO ASSIST THE INDEFATIGABLE LABORER
WHEN MY MORNING AND EVENING MEALS ARE BROUGHT THOUGHT HE I WILL CAST THEM OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THEY WILL THINK THAT I HAVE EATEN THEM HE KEPT HIS WORD TWICE A DAY HE CAST OUT THROUGH THE BARRED APERTURE THE PROVISIONS HIS JAILER BROUGHT HIM
EDMOND FANCIED HE HEARD A BITTER LAUGH RESOUNDING FROM THE DEPTHS
I SWEAR TO YOU AGAIN RATHER THAN BETRAY YOU I WOULD ALLOW MYSELF TO BE HACKED IN PIECES
HE HAD OFTEN HEARD THAT SHIPWRECKED PERSONS HAD DIED THROUGH HAVING EAGERLY DEVOURED TOO MUCH FOOD EDMOND REPLACED ON THE TABLE THE BREAD HE WAS ABOUT TO DEVOUR AND RETURNED TO HIS COUCH HE DID NOT WISH TO DIE
HE FELT MORE GRATITUDE FOR THE POSSESSION OF THIS PIECE OF IRON THAN HE HAD EVER FELT FOR ANYTHING HE HAD NOTICED HOWEVER THAT THE PRISONER ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD CEASED TO LABOR NO MATTER THIS WAS A GREATER REASON FOR PROCEEDING
HE HELD THE PLATE IN HIS HAND FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME AND GAZED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MORSEL OF BAD MEAT OF TAINTED FISH OF BLACK AND MOULDY BREAD IT WAS THE LAST YEARNING FOR LIFE CONTENDING WITH THE RESOLUTION OF DESPAIR
IN THE MORNING THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM FRESH PROVISIONS HE HAD ALREADY DEVOURED THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HE ATE THESE LISTENING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE SOUND WALKING ROUND AND ROUND HIS CELL
SOON THE FURY OF THE WAVES AND THE SIGHT OF THE SHARP ROCKS ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND DEATH THEN TERRIFIED ME AND I USED ALL MY SKILL AND INTELLIGENCE AS A MAN AND A SAILOR TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE WRATH OF GOD BUT I DID SO BECAUSE I WAS HAPPY
IT WAS ONE OF THESE HE HAD UNCOVERED AND WHICH HE MUST REMOVE FROM ITS SOCKET DANTES STROVE TO DO THIS WITH HIS NAILS BUT THEY WERE TOO WEAK THE FRAGMENTS OF THE JUG BROKE AND AFTER AN HOUR OF USELESS TOIL HE PAUSED
AND IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A SCREW DRIVER TO TAKE THEM OFF THE TABLE AND CHAIR HAD NOTHING THE PAIL HAD ONCE POSSESSED A HANDLE BUT THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED
HE TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE SOUP WHICH THE JAILER HAD BROUGHT ROSE STAGGERED TOWARDS IT RAISED THE VESSEL TO HIS LIPS AND DRANK OFF THE CONTENTS WITH A FEELING OF INDESCRIBABLE PLEASURE
AND STRIVING TO DIMINISH THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED THEM NO NO DOUBTLESS HE WAS DECEIVED AND IT WAS BUT ONE OF THOSE DREAMS THAT FORERUN DEATH
YET IN SPITE OF HIS EARNEST PRAYERS DANTES REMAINED A PRISONER THEN GLOOM SETTLED HEAVILY UPON HIM
AND HE THEN TURNED TO GOD ALL THE PIOUS IDEAS THAT HAD BEEN SO LONG FORGOTTEN RETURNED HE RECOLLECTED THE PRAYERS HIS MOTHER HAD TAUGHT HIM
NO SOONER HAD THIS IDEA TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIM THAN HE BECAME MORE COMPOSED ARRANGED HIS COUCH TO THE BEST OF HIS POWER ATE LITTLE AND SLEPT LESS
OR REFUSE FOOD AND DIE OF STARVATION BUT THE FIRST WAS REPUGNANT TO HIM
ALL HIS SORROWS ALL HIS SUFFERINGS WITH THEIR TRAIN OF GLOOMY SPECTRES FLED FROM HIS CELL WHEN THE ANGEL OF DEATH SEEMED ABOUT TO ENTER DANTES REVIEWED HIS PAST LIFE WITH COMPOSURE
IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE TO DIG ABOVE OR UNDER IT THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THIS O MY GOD MY GOD MURMURED HE I HAVE SO EARNESTLY PRAYED TO YOU THAT I HOPED MY PRAYERS HAD BEEN HEARD
UNLESS THE PROTECTING HAND OF GOD SNATCH HIM THENCE ALL IS OVER AND HIS STRUGGLES BUT TEND TO HASTEN HIS DESTRUCTION THIS STATE OF MENTAL ANGUISH IS HOWEVER LESS TERRIBLE THAN THE SUFFERINGS THAT PRECEDE
YOU DESTROY EVERYTHING FIRST YOU BREAK YOUR JUG THEN YOU MAKE ME BREAK YOUR PLATE IF ALL THE PRISONERS FOLLOWED YOUR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE RUINED I SHALL LEAVE YOU THE SAUCEPAN AND POUR YOUR SOUP INTO THAT SO FOR THE FUTURE I HOPE YOU WILL NOT BE SO DESTRUCTIVE
AND CAPTIVITY THAT IS SHARED IS BUT HALF CAPTIVITY PLAINTS MADE IN COMMON ARE ALMOST PRAYERS AND PRAYERS WHERE TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER INVOKE THE MERCY OF HEAVEN
HOW OLD ARE YOU YOUR VOICE IS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN
BUT NOW THE JAILER MIGHT HEAR THE NOISE AND PUT AN END TO IT AND SO DESTROY A RAY OF SOMETHING LIKE HOPE THAT SOOTHED HIS LAST MOMENTS THE JAILER BROUGHT HIM HIS BREAKFAST
TWO HOURS PASSED AND NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE WALL ALL WAS SILENT THERE FULL OF HOPE EDMOND SWALLOWED A FEW MOUTHFULS OF BREAD AND WATER AND THANKS TO THE VIGOR OF HIS CONSTITUTION FOUND HIMSELF WELL NIGH RECOVERED
AT THE END OF AN HOUR THE STONE WAS EXTRICATED FROM THE WALL LEAVING A CAVITY A FOOT AND A HALF IN DIAMETER
WHO ARE HUNG UP TO THE YARD ARM HE WOULD NOT DIE BY WHAT SEEMED AN INFAMOUS DEATH HE RESOLVED TO ADOPT THE SECOND AND BEGAN THAT DAY TO CARRY OUT HIS RESOLVE NEARLY FOUR YEARS HAD PASSED AWAY
BEFORE HIM IS A DEAD SEA THAT STRETCHES IN AZURE CALM BEFORE THE EYE BUT HE WHO UNWARILY VENTURES WITHIN ITS EMBRACE FINDS HIMSELF STRUGGLING WITH A MONSTER THAT WOULD DRAG HIM DOWN TO PERDITION ONCE THUS ENSNARED
WAS HE TO BE THUS STOPPED AT THE BEGINNING AND WAS HE TO WAIT INACTIVE UNTIL HIS FELLOW WORKMAN HAD COMPLETED HIS TASK SUDDENLY AN IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM HE SMILED AND THE PERSPIRATION DRIED ON HIS FOREHEAD
WHOSE PRESENT SO MELANCHOLY AND HIS FUTURE SO DOUBTFUL NINETEEN YEARS OF LIGHT TO REFLECT UPON IN ETERNAL DARKNESS NO DISTRACTION COULD COME TO HIS AID
YOU OF THOSE WHOM YOU LOVE AND I OF THOSE WHOM I LOVE YOU MUST LOVE SOMEBODY NO I AM ALONE IN THE WORLD THEN YOU WILL LOVE ME IF YOU ARE YOUNG I WILL BE YOUR COMRADE IF YOU ARE OLD I WILL BE YOUR SON
OF WHOM THE GORGET FLORENCE SLIT ASUNDER
OTHER PEOPLE'S CHEEKS SO THAT IF THOU WERT LIVING TWERE TOO MUCH LIVING I AM AND DEAR TO THEE IT MAY BE WAS MY RESPONSE IF THOU DEMANDEST FAME THAT MID THE OTHER NOTES THY NAME I PLACE
WHENCE I BETOOK ME ALREADY BLIND TO GROPING OVER EACH AND THREE DAYS CALLED THEM AFTER THEY WERE DEAD THEN HUNGER DID WHAT SORROW COULD NOT DO WHEN HE HAD
THAT WILL BE JUST ABOUT THE SAME THING AS A SERMON PLEASE MAYN'T I GO MARILLA YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID ANNE DIDN'T YOU TAKE OFF YOUR BOOTS NOW AND GO TO BED IT'S PAST EIGHT THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING MARILLA
THEN TOW'RDS ME HE OUTSTRETCHED HIS WARY STEP I LIFTED UP MINE EYES AND THOUGHT TO SEE LUCIFER IN THE SAME WAY I HAD LEFT HIM AND I BEHELD HIM UPWARD HOLD HIS LEGS
AND LIFTED UP HIS BROW AGAINST HIS MAKER
WHO CAN SPEAK AND IS UNBOUND WHO AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL CRIME SHALL PLACE US
HEAR SHALT THOU AND SHALT KNOW IF HE HAS WRONGED ME A NARROW PERFORATION IN THE MEW WHICH BEARS BECAUSE OF ME THE TITLE OF FAMINE
THOU OPPROBRIUM OF THE PEOPLE OF THE FAIR LAND THERE WHERE THE SI DOTH SOUND SINCE SLOW TO PUNISH THEE THY NEIGHBOURS ARE
I SHOULD WISH THAT OF THE MEASURELESS BRIAREUS THESE EYES OF MINE MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCE WHENCE HE REPLIED THOU SHALT BEHOLD ANTAEUS CLOSE BY HERE
WHO ART THOU THAT THUS REPREHENDEST OTHERS NOW WHO ART THOU
GADDO THREW HIMSELF DOWN OUTSTRETCHED BEFORE MY FEET SAYING MY FATHER WHY DOST THOU NOT HELP ME
LET THE CAPRAIA AND GORGONA MOVE AND MAKE A HEDGE ACROSS THE MOUTH OF ARNO THAT EVERY PERSON IN THEE IT MAY DROWN FOR IF COUNT UGOLINO HAD THE FAME OF HAVING IN THY CASTLES THEE BETRAYED
WITH CHAINS THAT HELD HIM SO BEGIRT ABOUT FROM THE NECK DOWN THAT ON THE PART UNCOVERED IT WOUND ITSELF AS FAR AS THE FIFTH GYRE THIS PROUD ONE WISHED TO MAKE EXPERIMENT OF HIS OWN POWER AGAINST THE SUPREME JOVE
AND TO BE RUDE TO HIM WAS COURTESY
BUT IF MY WORDS BE SEED THAT MAY BEAR FRUIT OF INFAMY TO THE TRAITOR WHOM I GNAW SPEAKING AND WEEPING SHALT THOU SEE TOGETHER
OF A SMALL RIVULET THAT THERE DESCENDETH
WHO FULL FIVE ELLS WITHOUT THE HEAD FORTH ISSUED FROM THE CAVERN O THOU WHO IN THE VALLEY FORTUNATE WHICH SCIPIO THE HEIR OF GLORY MADE WHEN HANNIBAL TURNED BACK WITH ALL HIS HOSTS
MORE JUST AND MORE DISCREET WILL HOLD HER FOR IT FOR WHERE THE ARGUMENT OF INTELLECT IS ADDED UNTO EVIL WILL AND POWER NO RAMPART CAN THE PEOPLE MAKE AGAINST IT
A PLACE THERE IS BELOW FROM BEELZEBUB AS FAR RECEDING AS THE TOMB EXTENDS WHICH NOT BY SIGHT IS KNOWN
WHY DOST THOU MOLEST ME AND I MY MASTER NOW WAIT HERE FOR ME THAT I THROUGH HIM MAY ISSUE FROM A DOUBT THEN THOU MAYST HURRY ME AS THOU SHALT WISH THE LEADER STOPPED
HE SHOWED GREAT PROWESS WHAT TIME THE GIANTS TERRIFIED THE GODS THE ARMS HE WIELDED NEVER MORE HE MOVES AND I TO HIM IF POSSIBLE
WITH DIANA'S JAUNTY FUR CAP AND SMART LITTLE JACKET BUT SHE REMEMBERED IN TIME THAT SHE HAD AN IMAGINATION AND COULD USE IT THEN DIANA'S COUSINS THE MURRAYS FROM NEWBRIDGE CAME
O WHAT A MARVEL IT APPEARED TO ME WHEN I BEHELD THREE FACES ON HIS HEAD THE ONE IN FRONT AND THAT VERMILION WAS TWO WERE THE OTHERS THAT WERE JOINED WITH THIS
WHERE EVERYTHING OF WEIGHT UNITES TOGETHER AND I WAS SHIVERING IN THE ETERNAL SHADE
THOU STILL IMAGINEST THOU ART BEYOND THE CENTRE WHERE I GRASPED THE HAIR OF THE FELL WORM WHO MINES THE WORLD THAT SIDE THOU WAST SO LONG AS I DESCENDED
AND ONE WHO HAD BY REASON OF THE COLD LOST BOTH HIS EARS STILL WITH HIS VISAGE DOWNWARD SAID WHY DOST THOU SO MIRROR THYSELF IN US IF THOU DESIRE TO KNOW WHO THESE TWO ARE
IT WAS ELEVEN WHEN THEY GOT HOME SATED WITH DISSIPATION BUT WITH THE EXCEEDING SWEET PLEASURE OF TALKING IT ALL OVER STILL TO COME
AND WITH SHARP TUSHES IT SEEMED TO ME I SAW THEIR FLANKS RIPPED OPEN WHEN I BEFORE THE MORROW WAS AWAKE MOANING AMID THEIR SLEEP I HEARD MY SONS WHO WITH ME WERE AND ASKING AFTER BREAD
PANTING AS ONE FATIGUED MUST WE PERFORCE DEPART FROM SO MUCH EVIL THEN THROUGH THE OPENING OF A ROCK HE ISSUED AND DOWN UPON THE MARGIN SEATED ME
THEY HAD A PERFECTLY ELEGANT TEA AND THEN CAME THE DELICIOUS OCCUPATION OF DRESSING IN DIANA'S LITTLE ROOM UPSTAIRS
AND MADE ME STOP SAYING BEHOLD DIS AND BEHOLD THE PLACE WHERE THOU WITH FORTITUDE MUST ARM THYSELF HOW FROZEN I BECAME AND POWERLESS THEN ASK IT NOT READER
IS NOT BELOW HERE EVERY VAPOUR QUENCHED
SO I DON'T THINK YOU'RE VERY BADLY OFF TO SEE HER AGAIN BUT SHE WANTS TO SEE ME PLEADED ANNE SHE HAS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL ME HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE HAS
TO WHICH WERE NOT BEFITTING SWEETER PSALMS
THE ONE WHO HANGS FROM THE BLACK JOWL IS BRUTUS SEE HOW HE WRITHES HIMSELF AND SPEAKS NO WORD AND THE OTHER WHO SO STALWART SEEMS IS CASSIUS BUT NIGHT IS REASCENDING
ONE AND ALL OF THEM AS WHEN THE FOG IS VANISHING AWAY LITTLE BY LITTLE DOTH THE SIGHT REFIGURE WHATE'ER THE MIST THAT CROWDS THE AIR CONCEALS SO PIERCING THROUGH THE DENSE AND DARKSOME AIR
THE CREATURE WHO ONCE HAD THE BEAUTEOUS SEMBLANCE
AND ALL THE SCHOLARS WERE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN IT BY REASON OF OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO WERE GOING TO TAKE PART EVERYBODY IN SCHOOL OVER NINE YEARS OF AGE EXPECTED TO GO EXCEPT CARRIE SLOANE
DON'T BLAME ME BLAME MATTHEW ANNE SHIRLEY YOU'RE DRIPPING GREASY WATER ALL OVER THE FLOOR I NEVER SAW SUCH A CARELESS CHILD
IF THOU SHOULDST QUESTIONED BE WHO ELSE WAS THERE
HERE IT IS MORN WHEN IT IS EVENING THERE
BUT IN WALKING MONG THE HEADS I STRUCK MY FOOT HARD IN THE FACE OF ONE WEEPING HE GROWLED WHY DOST THOU TRAMPLE ME UNLESS THOU COMEST TO INCREASE THE VENGEANCE OF MONTAPERTI
MORE AND MORE NEAR APPROACHING TOW'RD THE VERGE MY ERROR FLED AND FEAR CAME OVER ME BECAUSE AS ON ITS CIRCULAR PARAPETS
AND I HEARD LOCKING UP THE UNDER DOOR OF THE HORRIBLE TOWER WHEREAT WITHOUT A WORD I GAZED INTO THE FACES OF MY SONS I WEPT NOT I WITHIN SO TURNED TO STONE
NOT HE IN WHOM WERE BROKEN BREAST AND SHADOW AT ONE AND THE SAME BLOW BY ARTHUR'S HAND FOCACCIA NOT NOT HE WHO ME ENCUMBERS SO WITH HIS HEAD I SEE NO FARTHER FORWARD
BUT YOU SEE MATTHEW DID MATTHEW UNDERSTANDS ME AND IT'S SO NICE TO BE UNDERSTOOD MARILLA ANNE WAS TOO EXCITED TO DO HERSELF JUSTICE AS TO LESSONS THAT MORNING IN SCHOOL
SHE AND DIANA TALKED SO CONSTANTLY ABOUT IT ALL DAY THAT WITH A STRICTER TEACHER THAN MISTER PHILLIPS DIRE DISGRACE
SHOWED SO MUCH OF HIM ABOVE IT THAT TO REACH UP TO HIS HAIR
AND THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE DIANA AND ME TO THE CONCERT IF YOU'LL LET ME GO THAT IS YOU WILL WON'T YOU MARILLA OH I FEEL SO EXCITED YOU CAN CALM DOWN THEN BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING
MARILLA GAVE A GASP OF HELPLESSNESS AND TOOK REFUGE IN SILENCE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN ANNE WAS WASHING THE BREAKFAST DISHES IN THE PANTRY MATTHEW PAUSED ON HIS WAY OUT TO THE BARN TO SAY TO MARILLA AGAIN I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LET ANNE GO MARILLA
I GUESS ONCE IS ENOUGH TO SAY THEM
BECAUSE THE EARLIEST TEARS A CLUSTER FORM AND IN THE MANNER OF A CRYSTAL VISOR FILL ALL THE CUP BENEATH THE EYEBROW FULL AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT AS IN A CALLUS
AND HE TO ME FOR THE REVERSE I LONG TAKE THYSELF HENCE AND GIVE ME NO MORE TROUBLE FOR ILL THOU KNOWEST TO FLATTER IN THIS HOLLOW THEN BY THE SCALP BEHIND I SEIZED UPON HIM AND SAID
WHEN IS DREAMING OF GLEANING OFTENTIMES THE PEASANT GIRL LIVID AS FAR DOWN AS WHERE SHAME APPEARS WERE THE DISCONSOLATE SHADES WITHIN THE ICE SETTING THEIR TEETH UNTO THE NOTE OF STORKS
FOR I BEHELD THIRTY GREAT PALMS OF HIM DOWN FROM THE PLACE WHERE MAN HIS MANTLE BUCKLES
IN HIS OWN BODY AND ONE NEAR OF KIN WHO MADE TOGETHER WITH HIM THE BETRAYAL
AT EVERY MOUTH HE WITH HIS TEETH WAS CRUNCHING A SINNER IN THE MANNER OF A BRAKE SO THAT HE THREE OF THEM TORMENTED THUS
WHAT DEVIL TOUCHES THEE NOW SAID I
THEY ALL CROWDED INTO THE BIG PUNG SLEIGH AMONG STRAW AND FURRY ROBES
AND BORE THE NAME OF SASSOL MASCHERONI WELL KNOWEST THOU WHO HE WAS IF THOU ART TUSCAN AND THAT THOU PUT ME NOT TO FURTHER SPEECH KNOW THAT I
SUCH DID ANTAEUS SEEM TO ME WHO STOOD WATCHING TO SEE HIM STOOP AND THEN IT WAS I COULD HAVE WISHED TO GO SOME OTHER WAY BUT LIGHTLY IN THE ABYSS WHICH SWALLOWS UP JUDAS WITH LUCIFER
WITH FLOOR UNEVEN AND UNEASE OF LIGHT ERE FROM THE ABYSS I TEAR MYSELF AWAY MY MASTER SAID I WHEN I HAD ARISEN TO DRAW ME FROM AN ERROR SPEAK A LITTLE
MAKE US NOT GO TO TITYUS NOR TYPHOEUS
YOU'VE GOT THE LOVELIEST COLOR
SOUL IDIOTIC KEEP TO THY HORN AND VENT THYSELF WITH THAT WHEN WRATH OR OTHER PASSION TOUCHES THEE SEARCH ROUND THY NECK
HE PUT US DOWN NOR THUS BOWED DOWNWARD MADE HE THERE DELAY BUT AS A MAST DOES IN A SHIP UPROSE INFERNO
MUCH LESS PAIN TWILL GIVE US IF THOU DO EAT OF US THYSELF DIDST CLOTHE US WITH THIS POOR FLESH AND DO THOU STRIP IT OFF I CALMED ME THEN NOT TO MAKE THEM MORE SAD
ABOVE THE MIDDLE PART OF EITHER SHOULDER AND THEY WERE JOINED TOGETHER AT THE CREST AND THE RIGHT HAND ONE SEEMED TWIXT WHITE AND YELLOW THE LEFT WAS SUCH TO LOOK UPON AS THOSE WHO COME FROM WHERE THE NILE FALLS VALLEY WARD
TURNED TO THE LEFT AND A CROSSBOW SHOT OFT WE FOUND ANOTHER FAR MORE FIERCE AND LARGE IN BINDING HIM WHO MIGHT THE MASTER BE I CANNOT SAY BUT HE HAD PINIONED CLOSE BEHIND THE RIGHT ARM AND IN FRONT THE OTHER
ISN'T IT ALL LIKE A BEAUTIFUL DREAM DO I REALLY LOOK THE SAME AS USUAL
SAID ANNE REPENTANTLY I MAKE SO MANY MISTAKES BUT THEN JUST THINK OF ALL THE MISTAKES I DON'T MAKE ALTHOUGH I MIGHT I'LL GET SOME SAND AND SCRUB UP THE SPOTS BEFORE I GO TO SCHOOL OH MARILLA MY HEART WAS JUST SET ON GOING TO THAT CONCERT I NEVER WAS TO A CONCERT IN MY LIFE
DIANA HAS JUST SIGNALED FIVE FLASHES AND I'M REALLY SUFFERING TO KNOW WHAT IT IS WELL YOU NEEDN'T SUFFER ANY LONGER SAID MARILLA SARCASTICALLY YOU CAN GO BUT YOU'RE TO BE BACK HERE IN JUST TEN MINUTES REMEMBER THAT
BEING OF BOTH DEPRIVED THE EMPEROR OF THE KINGDOM DOLOROUS FROM HIS MID BREAST FORTH ISSUED FROM THE ICE AND BETTER WITH A GIANT I COMPARE THAN DO THE GIANTS WITH THOSE ARMS OF HIS
WAS AND WAIT CARLINO TO EXONERATE ME THEN I BEHELD A THOUSAND FACES MADE PURPLE WITH COLD
I WOULD PRESS OUT THE JUICE OF MY CONCEPTION MORE FULLY BUT BECAUSE I HAVE THEM NOT NOT WITHOUT FEAR I BRING MYSELF TO SPEAK
WHEN CRIED ANOTHER WHAT DOTH AIL THEE BOCCA
WHICH HAS THE GREATEST PAIN THE MASTER SAID IS JUDAS ISCARIOT WITH HEAD INSIDE HE PLIES HIS LEGS WITHOUT OF THE TWO OTHERS WHO HEAD DOWNWARD ARE
THAT DAY WE ALL WERE SILENT AND THE NEXT AH OBDURATE EARTH WHEREFORE DIDST THOU NOT OPEN WHEN WE HAD COME UNTO THE FOURTH DAY
IT MUST NEEDS BE THOU NAME THYSELF OR NOT A HAIR REMAIN UPON THEE HERE WHENCE HE TO ME THOUGH THOU STRIP OFF MY HAIR I WILL NOT TELL THEE WHO I AM NOR SHOW THEE
AT LAST THEY WERE READY CHEEKS SCARLET AND EYES GLOWING WITH EXCITEMENT TRUE ANNE COULD NOT HELP A LITTLE PANG WHEN SHE CONTRASTED HER PLAIN BLACK TAM AND SHAPELESS TIGHT SLEEVED HOMEMADE GRAY CLOTH COAT
AND NEATH WHOSE COPE WAS PUT TO DEATH THE MAN WHO WITHOUT SIN WAS BORN AND LIVED
AND WHEN THE WINGS WERE OPENED WIDE APART HE LAID FAST HOLD UPON THE SHAGGY SIDES FROM FELL TO FELL DESCENDED DOWNWARD THEN BETWEEN THE THICK HAIR AND THE FROZEN CRUST
FOR FEAR OF HIM MADE OF THE SEA A VEIL AND CAME TO OUR HEMISPHERE AND PERADVENTURE TO FLEE FROM HIM
IT AIN'T INTERFERING TO HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION AND MY OPINION IS THAT YOU OUGHT TO LET ANNE GO
LOOKING AT PRISSY ANDREWS AT THE END OF EVERY SENTENCE ANNE FELT THAT SHE COULD RISE AND MUTINY ON THE SPOT IF BUT ONE ROMAN CITIZEN LED THE WAY ONLY ONE NUMBER ON THE PROGRAM FAILED TO INTEREST HER WHEN GILBERT BLYTHE RECITED
STILL FIXED REMAINETH AS HE WAS BEFORE UPON THIS SIDE HE FELL DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN
HAD SHOWN ME THROUGH ITS OPENING MANY MOONS ALREADY WHEN I DREAMED THE EVIL DREAM WHICH OF THE FUTURE RENT FOR ME THE VEIL THIS ONE APPEARED TO ME AS LORD AND MASTER
APPEARS FAR OFF A MILL THE WIND IS TURNING METHOUGHT THAT SUCH A BUILDING THEN I SAW AND FOR THE WIND I DREW MYSELF BEHIND MY GUIDE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO OTHER SHELTER
TWO FLASHES MEAN ARE YOU THERE THREE MEAN YES AND FOUR NO
OTHERS STAND ERECT THIS WITH THE HEAD AND THAT ONE WITH THE SOLES ANOTHER BOW LIKE FACE TO FEET INVERTS WHEN IN ADVANCE SO FAR WE HAD PROCEEDED
WHAT ART THOU WONT TO WEEP AT THEY WERE AWAKE NOW AND THE HOUR DREW NIGH AT WHICH OUR FOOD USED TO BE BROUGHT TO US AND THROUGH HIS DREAM WAS EACH ONE APPREHENSIVE
SAID THIS WITH HIS EYES DISTORTED THE WRETCHED SKULL RESUMED HE WITH HIS TEETH WHICH AS A DOG'S UPON THE BONE WERE STRONG AH PISA
MASTER SAY WHAT TOWN IS THIS AND HE TO ME BECAUSE THOU PEEREST FORTH ATHWART THE DARKNESS AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE
HE WEEPETH HERE THE SILVER OF THE FRENCH I SAW
TOWARDS US THEREFORE LOOK IN FRONT OF THEE MY MASTER SAID IF THOU DISCERNEST HIM AS WHEN THERE BREATHES A HEAVY FOG OR WHEN OUR HEMISPHERE IS DARKENING INTO NIGHT
IT WOULD UNSETTLE HER FOR A WEEK I UNDERSTAND THAT CHILD'S DISPOSITION AND WHAT'S GOOD FOR IT BETTER THAN YOU MATTHEW I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LET ANNE GO REPEATED MATTHEW FIRMLY ARGUMENT WAS NOT HIS STRONG POINT BUT HOLDING FAST TO HIS OPINION CERTAINLY WAS
WELL SHALT THOU SEE IF THOU ARRIVEST THERE HOW MUCH THE SENSE DECEIVES ITSELF BY DISTANCE THEREFORE A LITTLE FASTER SPUR THEE ON
THE GUIDE AND I INTO THAT HIDDEN ROAD NOW ENTERED TO RETURN TO THE BRIGHT WORLD AND WITHOUT CARE OF HAVING ANY REST WE MOUNTED UP HE FIRST AND I THE SECOND
ITSELF DOWN RUSHES INTO SUCH A CISTERN AND STILL PERCHANCE ABOVE APPEARS THE BODY OF YONDER SHADE THAT WINTERS HERE BEHIND ME THIS THOU SHOULDST KNOW IF THOU HAST JUST COME DOWN
ANNE AND DIANA TIPTOED INTO THE PARLOR A LONG NARROW ROOM OUT OF WHICH THE SPARE ROOM OPENED IT WAS PLEASANTLY WARM AND DIMLY LIGHTED BY THE EMBERS OF A FIRE IN THE GRATE
PLACE US BELOW NOR BE DISDAINFUL OF IT
LOOK HOW THOU STEPPEST TAKE HEED THOU DO NOT TRAMPLE WITH THY FEET THE HEADS OF THE TIRED MISERABLE BROTHERS WHEREAT I TURNED ME ROUND AND SAW BEFORE ME AND UNDERFOOT A LAKE
BOTH OF MY HANDS IN AGONY I BIT AND THINKING THAT I DID IT FROM DESIRE OF EATING ON A SUDDEN THEY UPROSE AND SAID THEY FATHER
SIGHED ANNE RAPTUROUSLY IT MUST BE SPLENDID TO GET UP AND RECITE THERE DO YOU SUPPOSE WE WILL EVER BE ASKED TO DO IT DIANA YES OF COURSE SOMEDAY THEY'RE ALWAYS WANTING THE BIG SCHOLARS TO RECITE
AND IF I FREE THEE NOT MAY I GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ICE THEN HE REPLIED
NOR YET THE NIGHT THEREAFTER UNTIL ANOTHER SUN ROSE ON THE WORLD AS NOW A LITTLE GLIMMER MADE ITS WAY INTO THE DOLOROUS PRISON
THE VALLEY WHENCE BISENZIO DESCENDS BELONGED TO THEM AND TO THEIR FATHER ALBERT THEY FROM ONE BODY CAME AND ALL CAINA THOU SHALT SEARCH THROUGH AND SHALT NOT FIND A SHADE MORE WORTHY TO BE FIXED IN GELATINE
TWERE BETTER YE HAD HERE BEEN SHEEP OR GOATS WHEN WE WERE DOWN WITHIN THE DARKSOME WELL BENEATH THE GIANT'S FEET BUT LOWER FAR AND I WAS SCANNING STILL THE LOFTY WALL I HEARD IT SAID TO ME
ANNE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE BORNE IT IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN GOING TO THE CONCERT FOR NOTHING ELSE WAS DISCUSSED THAT DAY IN SCHOOL THE AVONLEA DEBATING CLUB WHICH MET FORTNIGHTLY ALL WINTER HAD HAD SEVERAL SMALLER FREE ENTERTAINMENTS
FOR TIS NO ENTERPRISE TO TAKE IN JEST TO SKETCH THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE UNIVERSE NOR FOR A TONGUE THAT CRIES MAMMA AND BABBO
OPENED HIS EYES AND SAID DECIDEDLY WELL NOW MARILLA
AND NOW BENEATH THE HEMISPHERE ART COME
THE WAY IS LONG AND DIFFICULT THE ROAD AND NOW THE SUN TO MIDDLE TIERCE RETURNS IT WAS NOT ANY PALACE CORRIDOR THERE WHERE WE WERE BUT DUNGEON NATURAL
THERE WAS A MAGNIFICENT SUNSET AND THE SNOWY HILLS AND DEEP BLUE WATER OF THE SAINT LAWRENCE GULF SEEMED TO RIM IN THE SPLENDOR LIKE A HUGE BOWL OF PEARL AND SAPPHIRE BRIMMED WITH WINE AND FIRE
TINKLES OF SLEIGH BELLS AND DISTANT LAUGHTER THAT SEEMED LIKE THE MIRTH OF WOOD ELVES CAME FROM EVERY QUARTER OH DIANA BREATHED ANNE SQUEEZING DIANA'S MITTENED HAND UNDER THE FUR ROBE
IF I HAD NOT BEHELD THE MANACLES THEN WE PROCEEDED FARTHER IN ADVANCE
BUT I DON'T APPROVE OF THIS CONCERT PLAN
THEREFORE STOOP DOWN AND DO NOT CURL THY LIP STILL IN THE WORLD CAN HE RESTORE THY FAME BECAUSE HE LIVES AND STILL EXPECTS LONG LIFE IF TO ITSELF GRACE CALL HIM NOT UNTIMELY
ONCE BROUGHT'ST A THOUSAND LIONS FOR THY PREY AND WHO HADST THOU BEEN AT THE MIGHTY WAR AMONG THY BROTHERS SOME IT SEEMS STILL THINK THE SONS OF EARTH THE VICTORY WOULD HAVE GAINED
AND TIS TIME THAT WE DEPART FOR WE HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE AS SEEMED HIM GOOD I CLASPED HIM ROUND THE NECK
HIS BODY BY A DEMON IS TAKEN FROM HIM WHO THEREAFTER RULES IT UNTIL HIS TIME HAS WHOLLY BEEN REVOLVED
OH MARILLA WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW TOMORROW IS DIANA'S BIRTHDAY WELL HER MOTHER TOLD HER SHE COULD ASK ME TO GO HOME WITH HER FROM SCHOOL AND STAY ALL NIGHT WITH HER
BUT A FLORENTINE THOU SEEMEST TO ME TRULY WHEN I HEAR THEE THOU HAST TO KNOW I WAS COUNT UGOLINO AND THIS ONE WAS RUGGIERI THE ARCHBISHOP NOW I WILL TELL THEE WHY I AM SUCH A NEIGHBOUR
UNDERNEATH EACH CAME FORTH TWO MIGHTY WINGS
BUT THIS WAS TO BE A BIG AFFAIR ADMISSION TEN CENTS IN AID OF THE LIBRARY
AND EVEN AS BREAD THROUGH HUNGER IS DEVOURED THE UPPERMOST ON THE OTHER SET HIS TEETH THERE WHERE THE BRAIN IS TO THE NAPE UNITED NOT IN ANOTHER FASHION TYDEUS GNAWED THE TEMPLES OF MENALIPPUS IN DISDAIN
NOT DOWNWARD TURNED BUT ALL OF THEM REVERSED WEEPING ITSELF THERE DOES NOT LET THEM WEEP AND GRIEF THAT FINDS A BARRIER IN THE EYES TURNS ITSELF INWARD TO INCREASE THE ANGUISH
WHEN CHARLEMAGNE THE HOLY EMPRISE LOST SO TERRIBLY ORLANDO SOUNDED NOT SHORT WHILE MY HEAD TURNED THITHERWARD I HELD WHEN MANY LOFTY TOWERS I SEEMED TO SEE WHEREAT I
AND IF I THEN BECAME DISQUIETED LET STOLID PEOPLE THINK WHO DO NOT SEE WHAT THE POINT IS BEYOND WHICH I HAD PASSED RISE UP THE MASTER SAID UPON THY FEET
THEY WEPT AND DARLING LITTLE ANSELM MINE SAID THOU DOST GAZE SO FATHER WHAT DOTH AIL THEE STILL NOT A TEAR I SHED NOR ANSWER MADE ALL OF THAT DAY
BINGEN ON THE RHINE ANNE PICKED UP RHODA MURRAY'S LIBRARY BOOK AND READ IT UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED
EACH ONE HIS COUNTENANCE HELD DOWNWARD BENT FROM MOUTH THE COLD FROM EYES THE DOLEFUL HEART AMONG THEM WITNESS OF ITSELF PROCURES WHEN ROUND ABOUT ME
TILL I BEHELD THROUGH A ROUND APERTURE SOME OF THE BEAUTEOUS THINGS THAT HEAVEN DOTH BEAR
THAN THAT ONE DID THE SKULL AND THE OTHER THINGS
ANNE DID REMEMBER IT AND WAS BACK IN THE STIPULATED TIME ALTHOUGH PROBABLY NO MORTAL WILL EVER KNOW JUST WHAT IT COST HER TO CONFINE THE DISCUSSION OF DIANA'S IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE LIMITS OF TEN MINUTES BUT AT LEAST SHE HAD MADE GOOD USE OF THEM
HIS FACE APPEARED TO ME AS LONG AND LARGE AS IS AT ROME THE PINE CONE OF SAINT PETER'S AND IN PROPORTION WERE THE OTHER BONES SO THAT THE MARGIN WHICH AN APRON WAS DOWN FROM THE MIDDLE
IF ON MY HEAD A THOUSAND TIMES THOU FALL I HAD HIS HAIR IN HAND ALREADY TWISTED
NOW WAS I AND WITH FEAR IN VERSE I PUT IT THERE WHERE THE SHADES WERE WHOLLY COVERED UP
WHO SAW ME AS I SAW MYSELF TO QUIET IN ME MY PERTURBED MIND OPENED HER MOUTH ERE I DID MINE TO ASK AND SHE BEGAN THOU MAKEST THYSELF SO DULL
WHATEVER OF THE HOLY REALM I HAD THE POWER TO TREASURE IN MY MIND SHALL NOW BECOME THE SUBJECT OF MY SONG O GOOD APOLLO FOR THIS LAST EMPRISE MAKE OF ME SUCH A VESSEL OF THY POWER
THERE SHALT THOU SEE HOW IT PERFORCE IS EQUALLY RESPLENDENT NOW
BUT NOW ANOTHER PASSAGE RUNS ACROSS BEFORE THINE EYES AND SUCH THAT BY THYSELF THOU COULDST NOT THREAD IT ERE THOU WOULDST BE WEARY I HAVE FOR CERTAIN PUT INTO THY MIND THAT SOUL BEATIFIED COULD NEVER LIE
AND AS FOOLISH THOU THE GREAT LEADER OF THE GREEKS WILT FIND WHENCE WEPT IPHIGENIA HER FAIR FACE AND MADE FOR HER BOTH WISE AND SIMPLE WEEP
IF IN THE HEAT OF LOVE I FLAME UPON THEE BEYOND THE MEASURE THAT ON EARTH IS SEEN SO THAT THE VALOUR OF THINE EYES I VANQUISH MARVEL THOU NOT THEREAT FOR THIS PROCEEDS FROM PERFECT SIGHT
THUS OF HER ACTION THROUGH THE EYES INFUSED IN MY IMAGINATION MINE I MADE AND SUNWARD FIXED MINE EYES BEYOND OUR WONT
INTO THE LIGHT OF MY SWEET GUIDE WHO SMILING KINDLED IN HER HOLY EYES MARVEL THOU NOT SHE SAID TO ME BECAUSE I SMILE AT THIS THY PUERILE CONCEIT
OR EVER YET THE WARFARE BE ABANDONED WITH LIGHT THAT THROUGH THE WHOLE OF HEAVEN IS SPREAD KINDLED ARE WE AND HENCE IF THOU DESIREST TO KNOW OF US AT THINE OWN PLEASURE SATE THEE
THOU'LT SEE HOW I FROM THESE WAS IN DESIRE OF HEARING THEIR CONDITIONS AS THEY UNTO MINE EYES WERE MANIFEST O THOU WELL BORN UNTO WHOM GRACE CONCEDES TO SEE THE THRONES OF THE ETERNAL TRIUMPH
I SAW TURNED ROUND AND GAZING AT THE SUN NEVER DID EAGLE FASTEN SO UPON IT AND EVEN AS A SECOND RAY IS WONT TO ISSUE FROM THE FIRST AND REASCEND LIKE TO A PILGRIM WHO WOULD FAIN RETURN
WHO FROM ABOVE DESCENDS BECAUSE IN DRAWING NEAR TO ITS DESIRE OUR INTELLECT INGULPHS ITSELF SO FAR THAT AFTER IT THE MEMORY CANNOT GO TRULY
O'ER THE GREAT SEA OF BEING AND EACH ONE WITH INSTINCT GIVEN IT WHICH BEARS IT ON THIS BEARS AWAY THE FIRE TOWARDS THE MOON THIS IS IN MORTAL HEARTS THE MOTIVE POWER THIS BINDS TOGETHER
NAY TIS ESSENTIAL TO THIS BLEST EXISTENCE TO KEEP ITSELF WITHIN THE WILL DIVINE WHEREBY OUR VERY WISHES ARE MADE ONE SO THAT AS WE ARE STATION ABOVE STATION THROUGHOUT THIS REALM
BY PROVING AND REPROVING THE SWEET ASPECT AND THAT I MIGHT CONFESS MYSELF CONVINCED AND CONFIDENT SO FAR AS WAS BEFITTING I LIFTED MORE ERECT MY HEAD TO SPEAK BUT THERE APPEARED A VISION
ALMOST AS YE THE HEAVENS BEHOLD
WITH RELUCTANCE THAT HAS BEEN DONE IT WAS NOT RIGHT TO DO E'EN AS ALCMAEON
FROM THIS PROCEEDS WHATE'ER FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT APPEARETH DIFFERENT NOT FROM DENSE AND RARE THIS IS THE FORMAL PRINCIPLE THAT PRODUCES ACCORDING TO ITS GOODNESS DARK AND BRIGHT
NOT BECAUSE ALLOTTED THIS SPHERE HAS BEEN TO THEM BUT TO GIVE SIGN OF THE CELESTIAL WHICH IS LEAST EXALTED
FROM THE INTELLIGENCE PROFOUND WHICH TURNS IT THE IMAGE TAKES AND MAKES OF IT A SEAL AND EVEN AS THE SOUL WITHIN YOUR DUST THROUGH MEMBERS DIFFERENT AND ACCOMMODATED TO FACULTIES DIVERSE EXPANDS ITSELF
WHO IN SOME PRETTY LITTLE BOAT EAGER TO LISTEN HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING BEHIND MY SHIP THAT SINGING SAILS ALONG TURN BACK TO LOOK AGAIN UPON YOUR SHORES DO NOT PUT OUT TO SEA LEST
WHEN IT HAD LOST HER TURNED ROUND UNTO THE MARK OF MORE DESIRE AND WHOLLY UNTO BEATRICE REVERTED BUT SHE SUCH LIGHTNINGS FLASHED INTO MINE EYES
SILENCE IMPOSED UPON MY EAGER MIND THAT HAD ALREADY IN ADVANCE NEW QUESTIONS AND AS AN ARROW THAT UPON THE MARK STRIKES ERE THE BOWSTRING QUIET HATH BECOME SO DID WE SPEED INTO THE SECOND REALM
WITH THE PRECIOUS BODY THAT IT QUICKENS IN WHICH AS LIFE IN YOU IT IS COMBINED FROM THE GLAD NATURE WHENCE IT IS DERIVED THE MINGLED VIRTUE THROUGH THE BODY SHINES EVEN AS GLADNESS THROUGH THE LIVING PUPIL
SUFFICE HIM FOR WHOM GRACE THE EXPERIENCE RESERVES IF I WAS MERELY WHAT OF ME THOU NEWLY CREATEDST LOVE WHO GOVERNEST THE HEAVEN THOU KNOWEST WHO DIDST LIFT ME WITH THY LIGHT
NOR OF EXISTENCE MORE OR FEWER YEARS BUT ALL MAKE BEAUTIFUL THE PRIMAL CIRCLE AND HAVE SWEET LIFE IN DIFFERENT DEGREES BY FEELING MORE OR LESS THE ETERNAL BREATH THEY SHOWED THEMSELVES HERE
THEREFORE WHATEVER THING HAS SO GREAT WEIGHT IN VALUE THAT IT DRAGS DOWN EVERY BALANCE CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH OTHER SPENDING LET MORTALS NEVER TAKE A VOW IN JEST
THEREFORE IS GIVEN US BECAUSE OUR VOWS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND IN SOME PART VOID WHENCE I TO HER IN YOUR MIRACULOUS ASPECTS THERE SHINES I KNOW NOT WHAT OF THE DIVINE
MAKE PEOPLE TELL THAT FABULOUS TALE OF CAIN SOMEWHAT SHE SMILED AND THEN IF THE OPINION OF MORTALS BE ERRONEOUS SHE SAID
LISTEN AND BELIEVE FOR THE TRUE LIGHT WHICH GIVETH PEACE TO THEM PERMITS THEM NOT TO TURN FROM IT THEIR FEET AND I UNTO THE SHADE THAT SEEMED MOST WISHFUL TO SPEAK DIRECTED ME AND I BEGAN
WITH GAINS ILL GOTTEN THOU WOULDST DO GOOD DEED NOW ART THOU CERTAIN OF THE GREATER POINT BUT BECAUSE HOLY CHURCH IN THIS DISPENSES WHICH SEEMS AGAINST THE TRUTH WHICH I HAVE SHOWN THEE
TOWARDS ME TURNING BLITHE AS BEAUTIFUL SAID UNTO ME FIX GRATEFULLY THY MIND ON GOD WHO UNTO THE FIRST STAR HAS BROUGHT US
AND BY BEATRICE SPEAK SPEAK SECURELY AND BELIEVE THEM EVEN AS GODS WELL I PERCEIVE HOW THOU DOST NEST THYSELF IN THINE OWN LIGHT AND DRAWEST IT FROM THINE EYES
THE HAVING HEARD WITHOUT RETAINING IT IN THE ESSENCE OF THIS SACRIFICE TWO THINGS CONVENE TOGETHER AND THE ONE IS THAT OF WHICH TIS MADE THE OTHER IS THE AGREEMENT THIS LAST FOR EVERMORE IS CANCELLED NOT
AND SHINE IN ONE PART MORE AND IN ANOTHER LESS WITHIN THAT HEAVEN WHICH MOST HIS LIGHT RECEIVES WAS I
AND IF IT CHANCE THE OTHER I DEMOLISH THEN FALSIFIED WILL THY OPINION BE BUT IF THIS RARITY GO NOT THROUGH AND THROUGH THERE NEEDS MUST BE A LIMIT
WELL I PERCEIVE THAT NEVER SATED IS OUR INTELLECT UNLESS THE TRUTH ILLUME IT BEYOND WHICH NOTHING TRUE EXPANDS ITSELF IT RESTS THEREIN AS WILD BEAST IN HIS LAIR WHEN IT ATTAINS IT
BUT BY THAT ONE WHICH CIRCLES FOUR UNITETH WITH THREE CROSSES WITH BETTER COURSE AND WITH A BETTER STAR CONJOINED IT ISSUES AND THE MUNDANE WAX TEMPERS AND STAMPS MORE AFTER ITS OWN FASHION
IF EVIL APPETITE CRY AUGHT ELSE TO YOU BE YE AS MEN AND NOT AS SILLY SHEEP SO THAT THE JEW AMONG YOU MAY NOT MOCK YOU BE YE NOT AS THE LAMB THAT DOTH ABANDON ITS MOTHER'S MILK
OF THE HEART'S VEIL SHE NEVER WAS DIVESTED OF GREAT COSTANZA THIS IS THE EFFULGENCE
SO LIKEWISE THIS INTELLIGENCE DIFFUSES ITS VIRTUE MULTIPLIED AMONG THE STARS ITSELF REVOLVING ON ITS UNITY VIRTUE DIVERSE DOTH A DIVERSE ALLOYAGE MAKE
THAT MAKES THE UNIVERSE RESEMBLE GOD HERE DO THE HIGHER CREATURES SEE THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE ETERNAL POWER WHICH IS THE END
ANOTHER TRUTH WHICH IS OBSCURE TO ME I WISH TO KNOW IF MAN CAN SATISFY YOU FOR BROKEN VOWS WITH OTHER GOOD DEEDS SO THAT IN YOUR BALANCE THEY WILL NOT BE LIGHT
NE'ER RAN AS THOU WHO THITHERWARD RETURNEST IF OF MY FORMER DOUBT I WAS DIVESTED BY THESE BRIEF LITTLE WORDS MORE SMILED THAN SPOKEN I IN A NEW ONE WAS THE MORE ENSNARED AND SAID
SINCE ONLY THROUGH THE SENSE IT APPREHENDETH
AND FEET AND HANDS TO GOD ATTRIBUTES AND MEANS SOMETHING ELSE AND HOLY CHURCH UNDER AN ASPECT HUMAN GABRIEL AND MICHAEL REPRESENT TO YOU AND HIM WHO MADE TOBIAS WHOLE AGAIN THAT WHICH TIMAEUS ARGUES OF THE SOUL
WHICH IS WONT TO BE THE FOUNTAIN TO THE RIVERS OF YOUR ARTS THREE MIRRORS SHALT THOU TAKE AND TWO REMOVE ALIKE FROM THEE THE OTHER MORE REMOTE BETWEEN THE FORMER TWO SHALL MEET THINE EYES
O DIVINE SAID I FORTHWITH WHOSE SPEECH INUNDATES ME AND WARMS ME SO IT MORE AND MORE REVIVES ME MY OWN AFFECTION IS NOT SO PROFOUND AS TO SUFFICE IN RENDERING GRACE FOR GRACE
IS FOLLOWED BY GREAT FLAME PERCHANCE WITH BETTER VOICES AFTER ME SHALL PRAYER BE MADE THAT CYRRHA MAY RESPOND TO MORTAL MEN BY PASSAGES DIVERSE UPRISES THE WORLD'S LAMP
EVEN AS THE SUN THAT DOTH CONCEAL HIMSELF BY TOO MUCH LIGHT
E'ER MADE A LAKE SO WIDELY SPREAD ABROAD THE NEWNESS OF THE SOUND AND THE GREAT LIGHT KINDLED IN ME A LONGING FOR THEIR CAUSE NEVER BEFORE WITH SUCH ACUTENESS FELT WHENCE SHE
TURNED TOWARDS THESE CAUSE THAT BEHIND THY BACK BE PLACED A LIGHT ILLUMING THE THREE MIRRORS AND COMING BACK TO THEE BY ALL REFLECTED THOUGH IN ITS QUANTITY BE NOT SO AMPLE THE IMAGE MOST REMOTE
WITH FALSE IMAGINING THAT THOU SEEST NOT WHAT THOU WOULDST SEE IF THOU HADST SHAKEN IT OFF THOU ART NOT UPON EARTH AS THOU BELIEVEST BUT LIGHTNING FLEEING ITS APPROPRIATE SITE
I CAN MAKE MANIFEST THOU'LT SEE ME COME UNTO THY DARLING TREE AND CROWN MYSELF THEREAFTER WITH THOSE LEAVES OF WHICH THE THEME AND THOU SHALL MAKE ME WORTHY SO SELDOM FATHER DO WE GATHER THEM
DOUBT AT THE FOOT OF TRUTH AND THIS IS NATURE WHICH TO THE TOP FROM HEIGHT TO HEIGHT IMPELS US THIS DOTH INVITE ME
AS ONE WHOM TOO GREAT EAGERNESS BEWILDERS O WELL CREATED SPIRIT WHO IN THE RAYS OF LIFE ETERNAL DOST THE SWEETNESS TASTE WHICH BEING UNTASTED NE'ER IS COMPREHENDED
PARADISO CANTO THREE THAT SUN WHICH ERST WITH LOVE MY BOSOM WARMED OF BEAUTEOUS TRUTH HAD UNTO ME DISCOVERED
BEATRICE GAZED UPON ME WITH HER EYES FULL OF THE SPARKS OF LOVE AND SO DIVINE THAT OVERCOME MY POWER I TURNED MY BACK AND ALMOST LOST MYSELF WITH EYES DOWNCAST PARADISO
THAT UNTIL DEATH THEY MAY BOTH WATCH AND SLEEP BESIDE THAT SPOUSE WHO EVERY VOW ACCEPTS WHICH CHARITY CONFORMETH TO HIS PLEASURE
AND IN SUCH SPACE PERCHANCE AS STRIKES A BOLT AND FLIES AND FROM THE NOTCH UNLOCKS ITSELF
MAKES WITH ITS LIGHT THE HEAVEN FOREVER QUIET WHEREIN THAT TURNS WHICH HAS THE GREATEST HASTE AND THITHER NOW AS TO A SITE DECREED BEARS US AWAY THE VIRTUE OF THAT CORD
THIS OTHER SPLENDOUR WHICH TO THEE REVEALS ITSELF ON MY RIGHT SIDE AND IS ENKINDLED WITH ALL THE ILLUMINATION OF OUR SPHERE WHAT OF MYSELF I SAY APPLIES TO HER
THE OTHER DOUBT WHICH DOTH DISQUIET THEE LESS VENOM HAS FOR ITS MALEVOLENCE COULD NEVER LEAD THEE OTHERWHERE FROM ME THAT AS UNJUST OUR JUSTICE SHOULD APPEAR IN EYES OF MORTALS IS AN ARGUMENT OF FAITH
WHICH DOTH TRANSFORM YOU FROM OUR FIRST CONCEPTIONS THEREFORE I WAS NOT SWIFT IN MY REMEMBRANCE BUT WHAT THOU TELLEST ME NOW AIDS ME SO THAT THE REFIGURING IS EASIER TO ME BUT TELL ME
WHO UNTO COLCHOS PASSED WERE NOT SO WONDER STRUCK AS YOU SHALL BE WHEN JASON THEY BEHELD A PLOUGHMAN MADE THE CON CREATED AND PERPETUAL THIRST FOR THE REALM DEIFORM DID BEAR US ON AS SWIFT
WHICH AS IT APPREHENDS TO THE GOOD APPREHENDED MOVES ITS FEET WELL I PERCEIVE HOW IS ALREADY SHINING INTO THINE INTELLECT THE ETERNAL LIGHT THAT ONLY SEEN ENKINDLES ALWAYS LOVE
AND BREATHE AS AT THE TIME WHEN MARSYAS THOU DIDST DRAW OUT OF THE SCABBARD OF THOSE LIMBS OF HIS O POWER DIVINE LEND'ST THOU THYSELF TO ME
AND IF SOME OTHER THING YOUR LOVE SEDUCE TIS NOTHING BUT A VESTIGE OF THE SAME ILL UNDERSTOOD WHICH THERE IS SHINING THROUGH THOU FAIN WOULDST KNOW
MADONNA AS DEVOUTLY AS MOST I CAN DO I GIVE THANKS TO HIM WHO HAS REMOVED ME FROM THE MORTAL WORLD BUT TELL ME WHAT THE DUSKY SPOTS MAY BE UPON THIS BODY WHICH BELOW ON EARTH
TO FALL INTO MORE HARM HENCE WHEN PICCARDA USES THIS EXPRESSION SHE MEANETH THE WILL ABSOLUTE AND I THE OTHER
BE FAITHFUL AND NOT BLIND IN DOING THAT AS JEPHTHAH WAS IN HIS FIRST OFFERING WHOM MORE BESEEMED TO SAY I HAVE DONE WRONG THAN TO DO WORSE BY KEEPING
FOR IT IS NEAR THE PRIMAL TRUTH AND THEN THOU FROM PICCARDA MIGHT'ST HAVE HEARD COSTANZA KEPT AFFECTION FOR THE VEIL SO THAT SHE SEEMETH HERE TO CONTRADICT ME MANY TIMES BROTHER HAS IT COME TO PASS THAT TO ESCAPE FROM PERIL
THAT A PEARL ON FOREHEAD WHITE COMES NOT LESS SPEEDILY UNTO OUR EYES SUCH SAW I MANY FACES PROMPT TO SPEAK SO THAT I RAN IN ERROR OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH KINDLED LOVE TWIXT MAN AND FOUNTAIN
EITHER THROUGH AND THROUGH THIS PLANET THUS ATTENUATE WERE OF MATTER OR ELSE AS IN A BODY IS APPORTIONED THE FAT AND LEAN SO IN LIKE MANNER THIS WOULD IN ITS VOLUME INTERCHANGE THE LEAVES
AND PLEDGED ME TO THE PATHWAY OF HER SECT THEN MEN ACCUSTOMED UNTO EVIL MORE THAN UNTO GOOD FROM THE SWEET CLOISTER TORE ME GOD KNOWS WHAT AFTERWARD MY LIFE BECAME
BUT SUCH A SOLID WILL IS ALL TOO RARE AND BY THESE WORDS IF THOU HAST GATHERED THEM AS THOU SHOULDST DO THE ARGUMENT IS REFUTED THAT WOULD HAVE STILL ANNOYED THEE MANY TIMES
UNLESS COMPLIED WITH AND CONCERNING THIS WITH SUCH PRECISION HAS ABOVE BEEN SPOKEN THEREFORE IT WAS ENJOINED UPON THE HEBREWS TO OFFER STILL THOUGH SOMETIMES WHAT WAS OFFERED MIGHT BE COMMUTED AS THOU OUGHT'ST TO KNOW THE OTHER
GRATEFUL TWILL BE TO ME IF THOU CONTENT ME BOTH WITH THY NAME
BEATRICE DID AS DANIEL HAD DONE RELIEVING NEBUCHADNEZZAR FROM THE WRATH WHICH RENDERED HIM UNJUSTLY MERCILESS AND SAID WELL SEE I HOW ATTRACTETH THEE ONE AND THE OTHER WISH
MY SIGHT THAT FOLLOWED HER
FORASMUCH AS FOLLOWING THE SENSES THOU SEEST THAT THE REASON HAS SHORT WINGS BUT TELL ME WHAT THOU THINK'ST OF IT THYSELF AND I
HENCE IF I HELD MY PEACE MYSELF I BLAME NOT
AND IT CAN ATTAIN IT IF NOT THEN EACH DESIRE WOULD FRUSTRATE BE
THAT MY CONFESSION I REMEMBERED NOT SUCH AS THROUGH POLISHED AND TRANSPARENT GLASS OR WATERS CRYSTALLINE AND UNDISTURBED BUT NOT SO DEEP AS THAT THEIR BED BE LOST COME BACK AGAIN THE OUTLINES OF OUR FACES SO FEEBLE
A SACRIFICE IS OF THIS TREASURE MADE SUCH AS I SAY AND MADE BY ITS OWN ACT WHAT CAN BE RENDERED THEN AS COMPENSATION THINK'ST THOU TO MAKE GOOD USE OF WHAT THOU'ST OFFERED
PERHAPS HIS BOW DOTH HIT UPON SOME TRUTH
IF THEIR WILL HAD BEEN PERFECT LIKE TO THAT WHICH LAWRENCE FAST UPON HIS GRIDIRON HELD AND MUTIUS MADE SEVERE TO HIS OWN HAND IT WOULD HAVE URGED THEM BACK ALONG THE ROAD WHENCE THEY WERE DRAGGED AS SOON AS THEY WERE FREE
THE OTHER SPHERES BY VARIOUS DIFFERENCES ALL THE DISTINCTIONS WHICH THEY HAVE WITHIN THEM DISPOSE UNTO THEIR ENDS AND THEIR EFFECTS THUS DO THESE ORGANS OF THE WORLD PROCEED AS THOU PERCEIVEST NOW FROM GRADE TO GRADE
TASTING OF THE HERB THAT MADE HIM PEER OF THE OTHER GODS BENEATH THE SEA TO REPRESENT TRANSHUMANISE IN WORDS IMPOSSIBLE WERE THE EXAMPLE THEN
IF THIS WERE CAUSED BY RARE AND DENSE ALONE ONE ONLY VIRTUE WOULD THERE BE IN ALL OR MORE OR LESS DIFFUSED OR EQUALLY VIRTUES DIVERSE
FULL OF BEATITUDE THE SHADE WAS SEEN BY THE EFFULGENCE CLEAR THAT ISSUED FROM IT THINK READER IF WHAT HERE IS JUST BEGINNING NO FARTHER SHOULD PROCEED
WHERE'ER THE KEY OF SENSE DOTH NOT UNLOCK
SINCE IT MUST BE SO NOR DO I COMMEND I HELD MY PEACE BUT MY DESIRE WAS PAINTED UPON MY FACE AND QUESTIONING WITH THAT MORE FERVENT FAR THAN BY ARTICULATE SPEECH
HER EYES DIRECTED TOW'RDS ME WITH THAT LOOK A MOTHER CASTS ON A DELIRIOUS CHILD AND SHE BEGAN ALL THINGS WHATE'ER THEY BE HAVE ORDER AMONG THEMSELVES AND THIS IS FORM
I BEHELD IT SPARKLE ROUND ABOUT LIKE IRON THAT COMES MOLTEN FROM THE FIRE AND SUDDENLY IT SEEMED THAT DAY TO DAY WAS ADDED AS IF HE WHO HAS THE POWER HAD WITH ANOTHER SUN THE HEAVEN ADORNED
AS GIVING THE BELOVED LAUREL ASKS ONE SUMMIT OF PARNASSUS HITHERTO HAS BEEN ENOUGH FOR ME BUT NOW WITH BOTH I NEEDS MUST ENTER THE ARENA LEFT ENTER INTO MY BOSOM THOU
WHICH IS KNOWN TO THEE AS MATTER MAY WELL INDEED BE SUCH THAT ONE ERRS NOT
TO ALL THE REALM TIS PLEASING AS TO THE KING WHO MAKES HIS WILL OUR WILL AND HIS WILL IS OUR PEACE THIS IS THE SEA TO WHICH IS MOVING ONWARD WHATSOEVER IT DOTH CREATE
PERADVENTURE IN LOSING ME YOU MIGHT YOURSELVES BE LOST THE SEA I SAIL HAS NEVER YET BEEN PASSED MINERVA BREATHES AND PILOTS ME APOLLO AND MUSES NINE
WHEREAT SHE PROMPTLY AND WITH LAUGHING EYES OUR CHARITY DOTH NEVER SHUT THE DOORS AGAINST A JUST DESIRE EXCEPT AS ONE WHO WILLS THAT ALL HER COURT BE LIKE HERSELF
BECAUSE THEY CORUSCATE WHEN THOU DOST SMILE BUT KNOW NOT WHO THOU ART NOR WHY THOU HAST SPIRIT AUGUST THY STATION IN THE SPHERE THAT VEILS ITSELF TO MEN IN ALIEN RAYS
BE YE MORE SERIOUS IN YOUR MOVEMENTS BE YE NOT LIKE A FEATHER AT EACH WIND AND THINK NOT EVERY WATER WASHES YOU YE HAVE THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENT AND THE PASTOR OF THE CHURCH WHO GUIDETH YOU LET THIS SUFFICE YOU UNTO YOUR SALVATION
MUST BE PERFORCE THE FRUITS OF FORMAL PRINCIPLES AND THESE SAVE ONE OF COURSE WOULD BY THY REASONING BE DESTROYED BESIDES IF RARITY WERE OF THIS DIMNESS THE CAUSE THOU ASKEST
SINCE FROM ABOVE THEY TAKE AND ACT BENEATH OBSERVE ME WELL HOW THROUGH THIS PLACE I COME UNTO THE TRUTH THOU WISHEST THAT HEREAFTER THOU MAYST ALONE KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE FORD
THEREAFTER ANSWERED ME SO FULL OF GLADNESS SHE SEEMED TO BURN IN THE FIRST FIRE OF LOVE BROTHER OUR WILL IS QUIETED BY VIRTUE OF CHARITY
YE WHO IN THIS PLACE ARE HAPPY ARE YOU DESIROUS OF A HIGHER PLACE TO SEE MORE OR TO MAKE YOURSELVES MORE FRIENDS FIRST WITH THOSE OTHER SHADES SHE SMILED A LITTLE
TO LEARN FROM HER WHAT WAS THE WEB WHEREIN SHE DID NOT PLY THE SHUTTLE TO THE END A PERFECT LIFE AND MERIT HIGH IN HEAVEN A LADY O'ER US SAID SHE BY WHOSE RULE DOWN IN YOUR WORLD THEY VEST AND VEIL THEMSELVES
AND ALL THAT NATURE MAKES THEN IT WAS CLEAR TO ME HOW EVERYWHERE IN HEAVEN IS PARADISE ALTHOUGH THE GRACE OF GOOD SUPREME THERE RAIN NOT IN ONE MEASURE BUT AS IT COMES TO PASS
THEE THUS REMAINING IN THY INTELLECT WILL I INFORM WITH SUCH A LIVING LIGHT THAT IT SHALL TREMBLE IN ITS ASPECT TO THEE WITHIN THE HEAVEN OF THE DIVINE REPOSE REVOLVES A BODY
ON THIS ACCOUNT
BEYOND WHICH ITS CONTRARY PREVENTS THE FURTHER PASSING AND THENCE THE FOREIGN RADIANCE IS REFLECTED EVEN AS A COLOUR COMETH BACK FROM GLASS THE WHICH BEHIND ITSELF CONCEALETH LEAD
INTO ITSELF DID THE ETERNAL PEARL RECEIVE US EVEN AS WATER DOTH RECEIVE A RAY OF LIGHT REMAINING STILL UNBROKEN IF I WAS BODY
HE OF THE SERAPHIM MOST ABSORBED IN GOD MOSES AND SAMUEL AND WHICHEVER JOHN THOU MAYST SELECT I SAY AND EVEN MARY HAVE NOT IN ANY OTHER HEAVEN THEIR SEATS THAN HAVE THOSE SPIRITS THAT JUST APPEARED TO THEE
IN THE ORDER THAT I SPEAK OF ARE INCLINED ALL NATURES BY THEIR DESTINIES DIVERSE MORE OR LESS NEAR UNTO THEIR ORIGIN HENCE THEY MOVE ONWARD UNTO PORTS DIVERSE
YE OTHER FEW WHO HAVE THE NECK UPLIFTED
DOTH DEVIATE SOMETIMES THE CREATURE WHO THE POWER POSSESSES THOUGH THUS IMPELLED TO SWERVE SOME OTHER WAY IN THE SAME WISE AS ONE MAY SEE THE FIRE FALL FROM A CLOUD
CONTINUED THUS HER HOLY ARGUMENT THE GREATEST GIFT THAT IN HIS LARGESS GOD CREATING MADE AND UNTO HIS OWN GOODNESS NEAREST CONFORMED AND THAT WHICH HE DOTH PRIZE MOST HIGHLY IS THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL
AND TEMPTING A FREE MAN WOULD DIE OF HUNGER ERE EITHER HE COULD BRING UNTO HIS TEETH SO WOULD A LAMB BETWEEN THE RAVENINGS OF TWO FIERCE WOLVES STAND FEARING BOTH ALIKE
IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE YOU MAD I HOPED FOR A MOMENT THAT IT MIGHT SAID VILLEFORT BUT THAT HAPPINESS WAS DENIED ME HOWEVER RECOVERING MY STRENGTH AND MY IDEAS WHY SAID I SHOULD THAT MAN HAVE CARRIED AWAY THE CORPSE
AND I DID NOT DARE INQUIRE FOR YOU WHEN I RETURNED TO PARIS I LEARNED THAT YOU
BUT AS IT WAS WORD AGAINST WORD THEY COULD COME TO NO DECISION SO THEY SETTLED TO PUT THE PARTIES ON OATH BUT THE HEADMAN AND THE WOMAN BOTH SWORE THAT THEY HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH SAYING MAY WE DIE IF WE HAVE SPOKEN FALSELY
THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN CALLING UPON HER LAWYER
SHE WAS VERY PLAINLY DRESSED AS WOULD BE THE CASE WITH A WOMAN OF TASTE WALKING IN THE MORNING
AND THERE THEY LOST HER THEY LOST HER YES FOREVER MADAME DANGLARS HAD LISTENED TO THIS RECITAL WITH A SIGH A TEAR OR A SHRIEK FOR EVERY DETAIL AND THIS IS ALL SAID SHE AND YOU STOPPED THERE
MADAME DANGLARS HAD RISEN AND STOOD BEFORE THE PROCUREUR WHOSE HANDS SHE WRUNG IN HER FEEBLE GRASP I KNOW NOT I MERELY SUPPOSE SO AS I MIGHT SUPPOSE ANYTHING ELSE REPLIED VILLEFORT WITH A LOOK SO FIXED
A MAN MAY MURDER ANOTHER OUT OF REVENGE BUT HE WOULD NOT DELIBERATELY DROWN A CHILD PERHAPS CONTINUED VILLEFORT HE HAD PUT IT IN THE FOUNDLING HOSPITAL OH YES YES CRIED THE BARONESS MY CHILD IS THERE
SO SHE WENT TO THE HEADMAN AND ASKED HIM FOR THEM BUT HE AND HIS WIFE SAID
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND DIED WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT AND SHE WAS VERY UNHAPPY
THE HOUR THEN FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN WAITING DURING THE LAST YEAR HAD AT LENGTH ARRIVED HOW I WORKED HOW I HOPED HOW I STRUCK EVERY PIECE OF TURF THINKING TO FIND SOME RESISTANCE TO MY SPADE BUT NO I FOUND NOTHING
NOTHING WAS FOUND BENEATH THE FLOWERS THERE WAS NO CHILD DISINTERRED NO YOU MUST NOT WEEP NO YOU MUST NOT GROAN YOU MUST TREMBLE WHAT CAN YOU MEAN ASKED MADAME DANGLARS SHUDDERING
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE PATH WHICH LED TO THE LITTLE GATE BUT THIS EXAMINATION WAS AS USELESS AS THE FIRST AND WITH A BURSTING HEART I RETURNED TO THE THICKET WHICH NOW CONTAINED NO HOPE FOR ME OH CRIED MADAME DANGLARS
IT WAS THE END OF NOVEMBER ALL THE VERDURE OF THE GARDEN HAD DISAPPEARED THE TREES WERE NOTHING MORE THAN SKELETONS WITH THEIR LONG BONY ARMS AND THE DEAD LEAVES SOUNDED ON THE GRAVEL UNDER MY FEET MY TERROR OVERCAME ME TO SUCH A DEGREE AS I APPROACHED THE THICKET
BUT IT HAD JUST BEEN LET FOR NINE YEARS I FOUND THE TENANT I PRETENDED THAT I DISLIKED THE IDEA THAT A HOUSE BELONGING TO MY WIFE'S FATHER AND MOTHER SHOULD PASS INTO THE HANDS OF STRANGERS
BEHIND ME WAS AN ARTIFICIAL ROCKERY INTENDED TO SERVE AS A RESTING PLACE FOR PERSONS WALKING IN THE GARDEN IN FALLING MY HAND RELAXING ITS HOLD OF THE LABURNUM FELT THE COLDNESS OF THE STONE ON MY RIGHT I SAW THE TREE BEHIND ME THE ROCK
POOR THING SAID VILLEFORT PRESSING HER HAND IT WAS TOO SEVERE FOR YOUR STRENGTH FOR YOU WERE TWICE OVERWHELMED AND YET WELL WELL I MUST TELL YOU COLLECT ALL YOUR COURAGE FOR YOU HAVE NOT YET HEARD ALL
HOW I HAVE LONGED FOR ROYAL WEALTH TO PURCHASE A MILLION OF SECRETS FROM A MILLION OF MEN AND TO FIND MINE AMONG THEM AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME I TOOK UP MY SPADE I ASKED MYSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN
YOU CAN FEEL FOR MY EMOTION CAN YOU NOT SPARE ME THEN I BESEECH YOU WHEN I LOOK AT THIS ROOM WHENCE SO MANY GUILTY CREATURES HAVE DEPARTED TREMBLING AND ASHAMED WHEN I LOOK AT THAT CHAIR BEFORE WHICH I NOW SIT TREMBLING AND ASHAMED
DO NOT CRY YOU TOLD ONE FALSEHOOD AND SO YOUR SON HAS DIED TAKE YOUR CHILD BACK TO THE VILLAGERS AND TELL THEM THAT IT WAS FIVE GOLD COINS AND NOT THREE THAT YOU GAVE TO THE HEADMAN AND IF YOU DO THIS THE CHILD WILL COME TO LIFE AGAIN
DOUBTLESS IT IS CHANCE CHANCE
THE MAGISTRATE WAS SEATED IN AN ARM CHAIR WRITING WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THE DOOR HE DID NOT MOVE AS HE HEARD IT OPEN AND THE DOOR KEEPER PRONOUNCE THE WORDS WALK IN MADAME AND THEN RECLOSE IT
IF SHE KNEW HOW TO CHOOSE A WIFE AND ALSO WHAT SORT OF CATTLE TO BUY AND SHE SAID THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER HUSBAND HAD NOT TOLD HER THIS SO THE YOUTH SAID THAT HE WOULD GO TO SINGH CHANDO AND ASK
WHAT IS THERE MORE TO HEAR YOU ONLY LOOK BACK TO THE PAST AND IT IS INDEED BAD ENOUGH WELL PICTURE TO YOURSELF A FUTURE MORE GLOOMY STILL CERTAINLY FRIGHTFUL PERHAPS SANGUINARY
THEN THE YOUTH ASKED ABOUT THE TWO MEN HE HAD MET SINGH CHANDO SAID TELL THE FIRST MAN WHEN HE IS PLOUGHING TO PLOUGH TWO OR THREE FURROWS BEYOND THE BOUNDARY OF HIS FIELD AND HIS WEALTH WILL DIMINISH
FOR THE DECISION DOES NOT COME FROM YOU YOUR MISFORTUNES ARE GENERALLY IMPOSED UPON YOU AND YOUR FAULTS THE RESULTS OF OTHERS CRIMES IN ANY CASE SIR YOU WILL ALLOW REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS
AND THEN FLUNG IT DOWN IN HASTE SCARCELY HAD I COVERED IT WITH EARTH WHEN THE ARM OF THE CORSICAN WAS STRETCHED TOWARDS ME I SAW A SHADOW RISE AND AT THE SAME TIME A FLASH OF LIGHT I FELT PAIN
I HAVE SO MUCH WEALTH THAT I CANNOT LOOK AFTER IT ALL ASK HIM TO TAKE AWAY HALF FROM ME THE YOUTH PROMISED AND WENT ON AND HE MET ANOTHER MAN WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SO MANY CATTLE THAT HE COULD NOT BUILD ENOUGH COW HOUSES FOR THEM
I DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE STEP BY STEP THE ONLY THING I COULD NOT CONQUER WAS A STRANGE TREMBLING IN MY KNEES I GRASPED THE RAILINGS IF I HAD RELAXED MY HOLD FOR A MOMENT I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN I REACHED THE LOWER DOOR
YOU UNDERSTAND THEN THAT IF IT WERE SO SAID HE RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE BARONESS TO SPEAK TO HER IN A LOWER TONE WE ARE LOST THIS CHILD LIVES AND SOME ONE KNOWS IT LIVES SOME ONE IS IN POSSESSION OF OUR SECRET
SHE GAVE FIVE RUPEES TO THE VILLAGERS AND THEY MADE THE HEADMAN GIVE THEM TEN RUPEES FOR HAVING DECEIVED THEM AND THEY BOUGHT PIGS AND HAD A FEAST IN THE COURSE OF TIME THE BOY GREW UP AND HIS MOTHER URGED HIM TO MARRY HE ASKED HER
ALAS NO I KNOW NOT A WOMAN ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER CAME TO CLAIM IT WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THE NAPKIN THIS WOMAN GAVE ALL THE REQUISITE PARTICULARS AND IT WAS INTRUSTED TO HER BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE INQUIRED FOR THE WOMAN YOU SHOULD HAVE TRACED HER
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL GOING ON THAT MORNING AND MANY BUSINESS LIKE PERSONS AT THE PALAIS BUSINESS LIKE PERSONS PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO WOMEN
AND YOU ALMOST DYING YOURSELF CAME TO MEET ME WE WERE OBLIGED TO KEEP SILENT UPON THE DREADFUL CATASTROPHE YOU HAD THE FORTITUDE TO REGAIN THE HOUSE ASSISTED BY YOUR NURSE A DUEL WAS THE PRETEXT FOR MY WOUND
IT IS TRUE THEN HE SAID RATHER UTTERING HIS THOUGHTS ALOUD THAN ADDRESSING HIS COMPANION IT IS TRUE THEN
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK I DID I FEIGNED A CRIMINAL PROCESS AND EMPLOYED ALL THE MOST ACUTE BLOODHOUNDS AND SKILFUL AGENTS IN SEARCH OF HER
AND THE LETTER H TRULY TRULY SAID MADAME DANGLARS ALL MY LINEN IS MARKED THUS MONSIEUR DE NARGONNE WAS A BARONET AND MY NAME IS HERMINE THANK GOD MY CHILD WAS NOT THEN DEAD NO IT WAS NOT DEAD
BUT IF NO CLAIMANT APPEARED HE KEPT THEM AND SO HE BECAME RICHER THAN EVER AND THE YOUTH WENT ON AND MET THE MAN WHO WAS TOO RICH AND WHEN HE HEARD WHAT CHANDO HAD SAID HE THOUGHT
DESCRIBING A HALF CIRCLE WITH HIS CHAIR SO AS TO PLACE HIMSELF EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO MADAME DANGLARS IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SPEAKING ALONE WITH YOU AND I REGRET THAT WE HAVE ONLY NOW MET TO ENTER UPON A PAINFUL CONVERSATION
NEVERTHELESS SIR YOU SEE I HAVE ANSWERED YOUR FIRST APPEAL ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY THE CONVERSATION MUST BE MUCH MORE PAINFUL FOR ME THAN FOR YOU
AND SINCE MONTE CRISTO SPEAKS BEFORE US OF A CHILD DISINTERRED WHEN THAT CHILD COULD NOT BE FOUND IT IS HE WHO IS IN POSSESSION OF OUR SECRET JUST GOD AVENGING GOD MURMURED MADAME DANGLARS
I HAD TURNED UP THE EARTH OVER A SURFACE OF MORE THAN TWENTY FEET SQUARE AND A DEPTH OF TWO FEET A LABORER WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IN A DAY WHAT OCCUPIED ME AN HOUR BUT I COULD FIND NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEN I RENEWED THE SEARCH SUPPOSING IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE
AT THE OFFICE OF THE KING'S ATTORNEY LET US LEAVE THE BANKER DRIVING HIS HORSES AT THEIR FULLEST SPEED
IT IS TRUE THAT EVERY STEP IN OUR LIVES IS LIKE THE COURSE OF AN INSECT ON THE SANDS IT LEAVES ITS TRACK ALAS TO MANY THE PATH IS TRACED BY TEARS SIR SAID MADAME DANGLARS
OH IT REQUIRES ALL MY REASON TO CONVINCE ME THAT I AM NOT A VERY GUILTY WOMAN AND YOU A MENACING JUDGE
OUTSIDE THIS DOOR A SPADE WAS PLACED AGAINST THE WALL I TOOK IT AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE THICKET I HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A DARK LANTERN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAWN I STOPPED TO LIGHT IT THEN I CONTINUED MY PATH
BUT YOU SAID REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS HE WOULD REQUIRE IT AS A PROOF AH NO MADAME THAT COULD NOT BE DEAD BODIES ARE NOT KEPT A YEAR THEY ARE SHOWN TO A MAGISTRATE AND THE EVIDENCE IS TAKEN NOW NOTHING OF THE KIND HAS HAPPENED
AND DIRECTED THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE RUE DE HARLAY AS SOON AS SHE WAS SEATED IN THE VEHICLE SHE DREW FROM HER POCKET A VERY THICK BLACK VEIL WHICH SHE TIED ON TO HER STRAW BONNET SHE THEN REPLACED THE BONNET AND SAW WITH PLEASURE IN A LITTLE POCKET MIRROR
IS IT NOT BY CHANCE THAT THE UNFORTUNATE CHILD WAS DISINTERRED UNDER THE TREES THAT POOR INNOCENT OFFSPRING OF MINE WHICH I NEVER EVEN KISSED BUT FOR WHOM I WEPT MANY MANY TEARS
VILLEFORT'S ONLY ANSWER WAS A STIFLED GROAN BUT THE CHILD THE CHILD SIR REPEATED THE AGITATED MOTHER HOW I HAVE SEARCHED FOR HIM REPLIED VILLEFORT WRINGING HIS HANDS HOW I HAVE CALLED HIM IN MY LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
NIGHT ARRIVED I ALLOWED IT TO BECOME QUITE DARK I WAS WITHOUT A LIGHT IN THAT ROOM WHEN THE WIND SHOOK ALL THE DOORS BEHIND WHICH I CONTINUALLY EXPECTED TO SEE SOME SPY CONCEALED I TREMBLED
I RAN TO THE HOSPITAL AND LEARNED THAT THE SAME NIGHT THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER A CHILD HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE WRAPPED IN PART OF A FINE LINEN NAPKIN PURPOSELY TORN IN HALF THIS PORTION OF THE NAPKIN WAS MARKED WITH HALF A BARON'S CROWN
THE MEANS WE MIGHT HAVE USED WHICH WE IN OUR BLINDNESS COULD NOT SEE THEN SEEM SIMPLE AND EASY AND WE SAY WHY DID I NOT DO THIS INSTEAD OF THAT WOMEN ON THE CONTRARY ARE RARELY TORMENTED WITH REMORSE
IT IS GENERALLY THE CASE THAT WHAT WE MOST ARDENTLY DESIRE IS AS ARDENTLY WITHHELD FROM US BY THOSE WHO WISH TO OBTAIN IT OR FROM WHOM WE ATTEMPT TO SNATCH IT THUS THE GREATER NUMBER OF A MAN'S ERRORS
OH HEAVENS WHEN DAYLIGHT DAWNED I WENT DOWN AGAIN MY FIRST VISIT WAS TO THE THICKET I HOPED TO FIND SOME TRACES WHICH HAD ESCAPED ME IN THE DARKNESS
TO ANY ONE LIVING I MEAN YES YES I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL EJACULATED THE BARONESS NEVER I SWEAR TO YOU WERE YOU EVER IN THE HABIT OF WRITING IN THE EVENING WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED IN THE MORNING DO YOU KEEP A JOURNAL
WOULD HE NOT ONE DAY MAKE YOU PAY FOR KEEPING THIS TERRIBLE SECRET WOULD IT NOT BE A SWEET REVENGE FOR HIM WHEN HE FOUND THAT I HAD NOT DIED FROM THE BLOW OF HIS DAGGER IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE AND AT ALL RISKS
AND TELL THE SECOND MAN TO DRIVE AWAY THREE OR FOUR OF HIS CATTLE EVERY DAY AND THEIR NUMBER WILL DECREASE SO THE YOUTH RETURNED AND MET THE MAN WHO HAD TOO MANY CATTLE AND TOLD HIM WHAT CHANDO HAD SAID AND THE MAN THOUGHT
AND THEY OBEYED AND FROM THAT TIME HE GREW RICHER THAN EVER AND THE YOUTH RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER AND TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE ADVICE WHICH CHANDO HAD GIVEN TO THE TWO MEN AND ACTED ACCORDINGLY
THENCE I PASSED ON TO THE RHONE WHENCE I DESCENDED MERELY WITH THE CURRENT TO ARLES AT ARLES I WAS AGAIN PLACED ON MY LITTER AND CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TO MARSEILLES MY RECOVERY LASTED SIX MONTHS I NEVER HEARD YOU MENTIONED
FIXING HIS EYES MORE STEADFASTLY ON HER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE DID YOU EVER REVEAL TO ANY ONE OUR CONNECTION NEVER TO ANY ONE YOU UNDERSTAND ME REPLIED VILLEFORT AFFECTIONATELY WHEN I SAY ANY ONE PARDON MY URGENCY
THE WORLD EXCUSES AND NOTORIETY ENNOBLES YOU MADAME REPLIED VILLEFORT YOU KNOW THAT I AM NO HYPOCRITE OR AT LEAST THAT I NEVER DECEIVE WITHOUT A REASON IF MY BROW BE SEVERE IT IS BECAUSE MANY MISFORTUNES HAVE CLOUDED IT
WHAT THE CORSICAN COULD HAVE DONE WITH THE CHILD A CHILD ENCUMBERS A FUGITIVE PERHAPS ON PERCEIVING IT WAS STILL ALIVE HE HAD THROWN IT INTO THE RIVER
DIGGING UNDERNEATH THESE TREES FOUND NEITHER SKELETON NOR CHEST BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM WAS THERE NEITHER OF THEM THERE
WHAT THEN ASKED HERMINE TREMBLING VIOLENTLY SOMETHING MORE TERRIBLE MORE FATAL MORE ALARMING FOR US THE CHILD WAS PERHAPS ALIVE AND THE ASSASSIN MAY HAVE SAVED IT
I SEEMED EVERYWHERE TO HEAR YOUR MOANS BEHIND ME IN THE BED AND I DARED NOT TURN AROUND MY HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT I FEARED MY WOUND WOULD OPEN AT LENGTH ONE BY ONE
THE GRASS HAD GROWN VERY THICKLY THERE DURING THE SUMMER AND WHEN AUTUMN ARRIVED NO ONE HAD BEEN THERE TO MOW IT STILL ONE PLACE WHERE THE GRASS WAS THIN ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION IT EVIDENTLY WAS THERE I HAD TURNED UP THE GROUND I WENT TO WORK
THE INSTANT SHE APPEARED THE DOOR KEEPER ROSE CAME TO HER AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS NOT THE PERSON WITH WHOM THE PROCUREUR HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT AND ON HER AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER BEING GIVEN
IT INDICATED THAT HIS POWERFUL MIND WAS ON THE VERGE OF DESPAIR AND MADNESS AH MY CHILD MY POOR CHILD CRIED THE BARONESS FALLING ON HER CHAIR AND STIFLING HER SOBS IN HER HANDKERCHIEF VILLEFORT BECOMING SOMEWHAT REASSURED
THEN THE VILLAGERS MADE THEM SWEAR BY THEIR CHILDREN AND THE WOMAN AND THE HEADMAN LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE HEADS OF THEIR SONS AND SWORE AND WHEN THE WOMAN SWORE HER SON FELL DOWN DEAD AND SHE TOOK UP THE DEAD BODY IN HER ARMS AND RAN AWAY WITH IT
WALKING SIX LEAGUES A DAY MADAME DE VILLEFORT FOLLOWED THE LITTER IN HER CARRIAGE
I STOOD IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AND THREW MYSELF DOWN I ROSE AND AGAIN BEGAN DIGGING AND ENLARGING THE HOLE STILL I FOUND NOTHING NOTHING THE CHEST WAS NO LONGER THERE THE CHEST NO LONGER THERE MURMURED MADAME DANGLARS CHOKING WITH FEAR
WE KNOW OF NO GOLD COINS WHERE ARE YOUR WITNESSES YOU MUST HAVE HAD WITNESSES IN SUCH A BUSINESS AND THEY DROVE HER OUT SHE WENT AWAY CRYING AND CALLED THE VILLAGERS TOGETHER AND ASKED THEM TO DECIDE THE MATTER SO THEY QUESTIONED HER AND THE HEADMAN
BUT LISTEN TO ME LISTEN AND YOU WILL PITY ME WHO HAS FOR TWENTY YEARS ALONE BORNE THE HEAVY BURDEN OF GRIEF I AM ABOUT TO REVEAL WITHOUT CASTING THE LEAST PORTION UPON YOU OH YOU FRIGHTEN ME BUT SPEAK I WILL LISTEN YOU RECOLLECT THAT SAD NIGHT
HIS MOTHER WASHED HIS CLOTHES FOR HIM AND GAVE HIM FOOD FOR THE JOURNEY AND HE SET OUT ON THE WAY HE MET A MAN WHO ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING AND HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A PETITION TO SINGH CHANDO THEN SAID THE MAN MAKE A PETITION FOR ME ALSO
THINK NOT I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH THIS ONE EFFORT CONTINUED VILLEFORT NO I SEARCHED THE WHOLE THICKET I THOUGHT THE ASSASSIN HAVING DISCOVERED THE CHEST AND SUPPOSING IT TO BE A TREASURE HAD INTENDED CARRYING IT OFF BUT PERCEIVING HIS ERROR
COME BEFORE HIM DISGUISED UNDER THE SPECIOUS FORM OF NECESSITY THEN AFTER ERROR HAS BEEN COMMITTED IN A MOMENT OF EXCITEMENT OF DELIRIUM OR OF FEAR WE SEE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED AND ESCAPED IT
ALWAYS THE SAME ALWAYS THE CHILD'S CORPSE COMING EVERY NIGHT IN MY DREAMS RISING FROM THE EARTH AND HOVERING OVER THE GRAVE WITH MENACING LOOK AND GESTURE I INQUIRED IMMEDIATELY ON MY RETURN TO PARIS THE HOUSE HAD NOT BEEN INHABITED SINCE WE LEFT IT
NO NO MADAME THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CHANCE OH YES HAS NOT A FATAL CHANCE REVEALED ALL THIS WAS IT NOT BY CHANCE THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO BOUGHT THAT HOUSE WAS IT NOT BY CHANCE HE CAUSED THE EARTH TO BE DUG UP
SO THE WOMAN HASTENED BACK AND FOUND THE VILLAGERS STILL ASSEMBLED AND SHE TOLD THEM AS THE STRANGER HAD DIRECTED AND SHE AGREED TO BE SWORN AGAIN ON THE BODY OF THE CHILD AND THE HEADMAN PROMISED TO PAY FIVE GOLD PIECES IF THE CHILD WERE RESTORED TO LIFE
OH THE WICKEDNESS OF MAN IS VERY GREAT SAID VILLEFORT SINCE IT SURPASSES THE GOODNESS OF GOD DID YOU OBSERVE THAT MAN'S EYES WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING TO US NO BUT HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED HIM CAREFULLY
THOUGH I HAD MADE A HOLE TWICE AS LARGE AS THE FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN DECEIVED HAD MISTAKEN THE SPOT I TURNED AROUND I LOOKED AT THE TREES I TRIED TO RECALL THE DETAILS WHICH HAD STRUCK ME AT THE TIME
THANKS MADAME THANKS FOR YOUR PUNCTUALITY AND HE OFFERED A CHAIR TO MADAME DANGLARS WHICH SHE ACCEPTED FOR HER HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE FELT NEARLY SUFFOCATED IT IS A LONG TIME MADAME SAID THE PROCUREUR
THE VILLAGERS WERE VERY SORRY FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT THE HEADMAN AND HIS WIFE ABUSED THEM FOR NOT HAVING BELIEVED THEIR WORD THE WOMAN HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR BEFORE SHE MET A STRANGER WHO ASKED WHY SHE WAS CRYING AND WHEN SHE TOLD HIM HE SAID
WHEN YOU BUY A BULLOCK FIRST PUT YOUR HAND ON ITS QUARTER AND IF IT SHRINKS AND TRIES TO GET FREE BUY IT AND WHEN YOU WANT A WIFE ENQUIRE FIRST AS TO THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER GOOD PARENTS MAKE GOOD CHILDREN
I UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD NOTHING TO FEAR THAT I SHOULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD SO I DECIDED UPON DESCENDING TO THE GARDEN
DOUBTLESS HE IS CAPRICIOUS BUT THAT IS ALL ONE THING ALONE STRUCK ME OF ALL THE EXQUISITE THINGS HE PLACED BEFORE US HE TOUCHED NOTHING I MIGHT HAVE SUSPECTED HE WAS POISONING US AND YOU SEE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED
NO NOISE DISTURBED THE SILENCE BUT THE OWL WHOSE PIERCING CRY SEEMED TO BE CALLING UP THE PHANTOMS OF THE NIGHT I TIED MY LANTERN TO A FORKED BRANCH I HAD NOTICED A YEAR BEFORE
AS THOUGH SHE WOULD SPRING FROM HER CHAIR BUT VILLEFORT STOPPED AND CLASPED HIS HANDS AS IF TO IMPLORE HER ATTENTION WE THOUGHT IT DEAD HE REPEATED I PLACED IT IN THE CHEST WHICH WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF A COFFIN I DESCENDED TO THE GARDEN I DUG A HOLE
HAD DUG ANOTHER HOLE AND DEPOSITED IT THERE BUT I COULD FIND NOTHING THEN THE IDEA STRUCK ME THAT HE HAD NOT TAKEN THESE PRECAUTIONS AND HAD SIMPLY THROWN IT IN A CORNER IN THE LAST CASE I MUST WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT TO RENEW MY SEARCH I REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND WAITED
MY CHILD WAS ALIVE SAID SHE YOU BURIED MY CHILD ALIVE
THOUGH WE SCARCELY EXPECTED IT OUR SECRET REMAINED IN OUR OWN KEEPING ALONE I WAS TAKEN TO VERSAILLES FOR THREE MONTHS I STRUGGLED WITH DEATH AT LAST AS I SEEMED TO CLING TO LIFE I WAS ORDERED TO THE SOUTH
WHEN YOU WERE HALF EXPIRING ON THAT BED IN THE RED DAMASK ROOM WHILE I SCARCELY LESS AGITATED THAN YOU AWAITED YOUR DELIVERY THE CHILD WAS BORN WAS GIVEN TO ME MOTIONLESS BREATHLESS VOICELESS WE THOUGHT IT DEAD
BUT NO SOONER HAD THE MAN'S FOOTSTEPS CEASED THAN HE STARTED UP DREW THE BOLTS CLOSED THE CURTAINS AND EXAMINED EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM THEN WHEN HE HAD ASSURED HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY RELIEVED OF DOUBTS HE SAID
I FEEL THAT MY PLACE IS NOT IN THE JUDGE'S SEAT BUT ON THE PRISONER'S STOOL YOU SAID MADAME DANGLARS YES I I THINK SIR YOU EXAGGERATE YOUR SITUATION SAID MADAME DANGLARS WHOSE BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED FOR A MOMENT
AND NO ONE WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME BUT THE HEADMAN'S WIFE IN DUE TIME HER CHILD WAS BORN AND BY THE MERCY OF SINGH CHANDO IT WAS A SON AND WHEN THE BOY HAD GROWN A BIT AND COULD RUN ALONE HIS MOTHER DECIDED TO TAKE BACK THE GOLD COINS
I CONSIDER MYSELF AS BRAVE AS MOST MEN BUT WHEN I DREW FROM MY BREAST THE LITTLE KEY OF THE STAIRCASE WHICH I HAD FOUND IN MY COAT THAT LITTLE KEY WE BOTH USED TO CHERISH SO MUCH WHICH YOU WISHED TO HAVE FASTENED TO A GOLDEN RING
AND WHY HE SPEAKS IN OUR PRESENCE OF CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN DISINTERRED IN A GARDEN VILLEFORT PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS WITH AN ACCENT WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THE COUNT SHUDDER HAD HE HEARD HIM THEN HE PRESSED THE HAND THE BARONESS RELUCTANTLY GAVE HIM AND LED HER RESPECTFULLY BACK TO THE DOOR
SHE WAS LEFT WELL OFF AND AMONG HER PROPERTY WERE THREE GOLD COINS AND AS SHE WAS AFRAID OF THESE BEING STOLEN SHE DECIDED TO PLACE THEM IN THE CARE OF THE VILLAGE HEADMAN SO SHE TOOK THEM TO HIM AND ASKED HIM TO KEEP THEM TILL HER CHILD WAS BORN
THE PATHS OF WHICH YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING HAVE BEEN TRACED BY ALL YOUNG MEN OF ARDENT IMAGINATIONS BESIDES THE PLEASURE THERE IS ALWAYS REMORSE FROM THE INDULGENCE OF OUR PASSIONS AND AFTER ALL WHAT HAVE YOU MEN TO FEAR FROM ALL THIS
YES DOUBTLESS BUT BELIEVE ME THAT MAN HAS OTHER PROJECTS FOR THAT REASON I WISHED TO SEE YOU TO SPEAK TO YOU TO WARN YOU AGAINST EVERY ONE BUT ESPECIALLY AGAINST HIM TELL ME CRIED VILLEFORT
THAT HER WHITE COMPLEXION AND BRILLIANT EYES WERE ALONE VISIBLE THE CAB CROSSED THE PONT NEUF AND ENTERED THE RUE DE HARLAY BY THE PLACE DAUPHINE THE DRIVER WAS PAID AS THE DOOR OPENED
HOW IS IT THAT IT HAS ESCAPED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE TOMB AND THE RECESSES OF OUR HEARTS WHERE IT WAS BURIED TO VISIT US NOW LIKE A PHANTOM WHITENING OUR CHEEKS AND FLUSHING OUR BROWS WITH SHAME ALAS SAID HERMINE
VILLEFORT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS DO I KNOW SAID HE AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF I KNEW
PERCEIVED THAT TO AVERT THE MATERNAL STORM GATHERING OVER HIS HEAD
OH NO SAID VILLEFORT I NEVER CEASED TO SEARCH AND TO INQUIRE HOWEVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS I HAD ALLOWED MYSELF SOME RESPITE BUT NOW I WILL BEGIN WITH MORE PERSEVERANCE AND FURY THAN EVER SINCE FEAR URGES ME NOT MY CONSCIENCE BUT
IF I DRIVE AWAY THREE OR FOUR HEAD OF CATTLE EVERY DAY I SHALL SOON BECOME POOR SO FROM THAT TIME HE LOOKED OUT FOR ANY STRAYING CATTLE AND WOULD DRIVE THEM HOME WITH HIS OWN IF THE OWNER CLAIMED THEM HE GAVE THEM UP
SO THE WOMAN LAID HER HANDS ON THE DEAD CHILD AND SWORE AND IT WAS RESTORED TO LIFE THEN THE HEADMAN WAS DUMBFOUNDED AND RELUCTANTLY BROUGHT OUT FIVE GOLD PIECES AND GAVE THEM TO THE WOMAN
NO SAID VILLEFORT BURYING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS NO A HUNDRED TIMES NO THEN YOU DID NOT BURY THE POOR CHILD THERE SIR WHY DID YOU DECEIVE ME WHERE DID YOU PLACE IT TELL ME WHERE THERE
BUT SINCE THEN EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED IN AND ABOUT ME I AM ACCUSTOMED TO BRAVE DIFFICULTIES AND IN THE CONFLICT TO CRUSH THOSE WHO BY THEIR OWN FREE WILL OR BY CHANCE VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY INTERFERE WITH ME IN MY CAREER
IF I PLOUGH OVER THE BOUNDARY ON TO MY NEIGHBOUR'S LAND IT WILL BE A GREAT SIN AND I SHALL SOON BECOME POOR AND HE WENT TO HIS PLOUGHMEN AND TOLD THEM NEVER TO PLOUGH RIGHT UP TO THE EDGE OF THE FIELD BUT TO LEAVE TWO OF THREE FURROWS SPACE
AND HE PROMISED AND WENT ON AND CAME TO SINGH CHANDO AND THERE HE ASKED HOW TO CHOOSE A WIFE AND HOW TO BUY CATTLE AND SINGH CHANDO SAID
IF MY HEART BE PETRIFIED IT IS THAT IT MIGHT SUSTAIN THE BLOWS IT HAS RECEIVED I WAS NOT SO IN MY YOUTH I WAS NOT SO ON THE NIGHT OF THE BETROTHAL
A COLD SHARP WIND WHISTLED THROUGH THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES AND YET THE DROPS FELL FROM MY FOREHEAD I RECOLLECTED THAT I WAS STABBED JUST AS I WAS TRAMPLING THE GROUND TO FILL UP THE HOLE WHILE DOING SO I HAD LEANED AGAINST A LABURNUM
WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW THE PALE MOON SHEDDING A LONG STREAM OF WHITE LIGHT ON THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE LIKE A SPECTRE I LEANED AGAINST THE WALL AND NEARLY SHRIEKED I SEEMED TO BE GOING MAD AT LAST I MASTERED MY AGITATION
AND HAD LEFT HOME IN THE CARRIAGE SHE DIRECTED HER COURSE TOWARDS THE FAUBOURG SAINT GERMAIN WENT DOWN THE RUE MAZARINE AND STOPPED AT THE PASSAGE DU PONT NEUF SHE DESCENDED AND WENT THROUGH THE PASSAGE
THE BARONESS KNEW HOW CALM VILLEFORT NATURALLY WAS AND HIS PRESENT EXCITEMENT FRIGHTENED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SCREAM BUT THE SOUND DIED IN HER THROAT HOW HAS THIS TERRIBLE PAST BEEN RECALLED CRIED VILLEFORT
AND A MITE OF A GIRL FACING THE END OF EVERYTHING YOUR HIGHNESS IS SAID TO BE BRAVE BUT EVEN YOUR WONDERFUL COURAGE CAN AVAIL NOTHING IN THIS INSTANCE SAID THE LEADER PLEASANTLY
SHE UTTERED THE LAST OBSERVATION IN A LOUD VOICE AND IT HAD ITS EFFECT FOR THE LEADER CAME TO HER SIDE WITH LONG STRIDES CONVINCE YOUR SERVANT THAT WE MEAN NO HARM YOUR HIGHNESS HE SAID EAGERLY A NEW DEFERENCE IN HIS VOICE AND MANNER
AND THE PRAISE OF SUCH A GIRL AS MISS THORPE EVEN YOU CATHERINE
HER BROTHER TOLD HER THAT IT WAS TWENTY THREE MILES THREE AND TWENTY CRIED THORPE FIVE AND TWENTY IF IT IS AN INCH MORLAND REMONSTRATED PLEADED THE AUTHORITY OF ROAD BOOKS INNKEEPERS AND MILESTONES
THE MUTE APPEAL TRUST ME YOUR HIGHNESS HE SAID GRAVELY AND SHE ALLOWED HIM TO HAND HER INTO THE COACH A MOMENT LATER HE WAS UPON THE DRIVER'S BOX REINS IN HAND
SO WHAT MATTERS AFTER ALL WE RESERVE THE RIGHT HOWEVER TO DO HOMAGE TO THE QUEEN WHO RULES OVER THESE WISE OLD HILLS I OFFER YOU THE HUMBLE SERVICES OF MYSELF AND MY COMPANIONS WE ARE YOURS TO COMMAND
IT REMAINED ONLY FOR HER TO IMPRESS UPON AUNT FANNY THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS RESOLUTION WHAT WISE OLD HILLS THEY MUST BE SHE SAID WITH EVASIVE ENTHUSIASM YOU CANNOT EXPECT ME TO ADMIT HOWEVER THAT I AM THE PRINCESS SHE WENT ON
WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED WITH GREAT KINDNESS BY MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN INVITED BY THE FORMER TO DINE WITH THEM AND SUMMONED BY THE LATTER TO GUESS THE PRICE AND WEIGH THE MERITS OF A NEW MUFF AND TIPPET A PRE ENGAGEMENT IN EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
THE AWFUL ROCKING AND THE JOLTING GREW LESS SEVERE
SO CONTENTEDLY WAS SHE ENDEAVOURING TO ENSURE A PLEASANT WALK TO HIM WHO BROUGHT THE DOUBLE RECOMMENDATION OF BEING HER BROTHER'S FRIEND AND HER FRIEND'S BROTHER SO PURE AND UNCOQUETTISH WERE HER FEELINGS THAT
MAY BE PROUD OF INDEED I AM SHE REPLIED I LOVE HER EXCEEDINGLY AND AM DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT YOU LIKE HER TOO YOU HARDLY MENTIONED ANYTHING OF HER WHEN YOU WROTE TO ME AFTER YOUR VISIT THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SHOULD SOON SEE YOU MYSELF
IS YO DAID YIT MISS BEV'LY IS DE END CAME MOANED AUNT FANNY BEVERLY COULD NOT REPRESS A SMILE I AM QUITE ALIVE AUNTIE THESE MEN WILL NOT HURT US THEY ARE VERY NICE GENTLEMEN
AND ON FINDING WHITHER THEY WERE GOING IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE GENTLEMEN SHOULD ACCOMPANY THEM TO EDGAR'S BUILDINGS AND PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO MISSUS THORPE JAMES AND ISABELLA LED THE WAY AND SO WELL SATISFIED WAS THE LATTER WITH HER LOT
HE RAN IT A FEW WEEKS TILL I BELIEVE IT WAS CONVENIENT TO HAVE DONE WITH IT
AND THE MOANING OF THE OLD NEGRESS BEVERLY REALIZED WITH A SINKING HEART THAT THEY WERE ALONE AND HELPLESS IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH NIGHT UPON THEM SHE NEVER KNEW WHERE THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE CAME FROM
PERMIT ME TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER ALONE YOU HAVE A RAGGED FOLLOWING YOUR HIGHNESS BUT IT SHALL BE A LOYAL ONE WILL YOU RE ENTER THE COACH IT IS NOT FAR TO THE PLACE I SPEAK OF AND I MYSELF WILL DRIVE YOU THERE COME
THE HORSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CHECKED WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH ALMOST THREW HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES
SUCH AS REPELLING BRIGANDS WHO SUDDENLY APPEAR UPON THE SCENE YES MAY I ASK WHY YOU DID NOT USE IT THIS EVENING BECAUSE IT IS LOCKED UP IN ONE OF MY BAGS I DON'T KNOW JUST WHICH ONE AND AUNT FANNY HAS THE KEY
A MISSTEP OR A FALSE TURN MIGHT EASILY START THE CLUMSY VEHICLE ROLLING DOWN THE DECLIVITY ON THE RIGHT THE CONVICT WAS TAKING DESPERATE CHANCES AND WITH A COOL CALCULATING BRAIN PREPARED TO LEAP TO THE GROUND IN CASE OF ACCIDENT
HE WAS DELIBERATELY TAKING HER FARTHER INTO THE MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES HIS PURPOSE KNOWN ONLY TO HIMSELF A HUNDRED TERRORS PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO HER
WITH SOME HESITATION FROM THE FEAR OF MORTIFYING HIM NO SURE WAS IT AYE I REMEMBER SO IT WAS I WAS THINKING OF THAT OTHER STUPID BOOK WRITTEN BY THAT WOMAN THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SHE WHO MARRIED THE FRENCH EMIGRANT
I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL TOGETHER WHILE YOU ARE IN BATH SHE IS A MOST AMIABLE GIRL SUCH A SUPERIOR UNDERSTANDING HOW FOND ALL THE FAMILY ARE OF HER SHE IS EVIDENTLY THE GENERAL FAVOURITE
DRIVEN ALONG ON BAD PAVEMENT BY A MOST KNOWING LOOKING COACHMAN WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT COULD MOST FITLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HIMSELF HIS COMPANION AND HIS HORSE OH THESE ODIOUS GIGS SAID ISABELLA LOOKING UP HOW I DETEST THEM
I NEED NOT ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE HAPPY HERE MY DEAR CATHERINE WITH SUCH A COMPANION AND FRIEND AS ISABELLA THORPE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BE OTHERWISE
NO NO I SHALL EXERCISE MINE AT THE AVERAGE OF FOUR HOURS EVERY DAY WHILE I AM HERE SHALL YOU INDEED SAID CATHERINE VERY SERIOUSLY
BUT PRAY WHY DO YOU CALL ME YOUR HIGHNESS DEMANDED BEVERLY THE TALL LEADER SWEPT THE GROUND WITH HIS HAT ONCE MORE ALL THE OUTSIDE WORLD KNOWS THE PRINCESS YETIVE WHY NOT THE HUMBLE MOUNTAIN MAN YOU WILL PARDON ME
I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO FIND THAT YOU ARE NOT BRIGANDS BELIEVE ME SAID BEVERLY PRAY TELL ME WHO YOU ARE THEN
THOUGH THEY OVERTOOK AND PASSED THE TWO OFFENDING YOUNG MEN IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS SO FAR FROM SEEKING TO ATTRACT THEIR NOTICE THAT SHE LOOKED BACK AT THEM ONLY THREE TIMES JOHN THORPE KEPT OF COURSE WITH CATHERINE
HALF A MINUTE CONDUCTED THEM THROUGH THE PUMP YARD TO THE ARCHWAY OPPOSITE UNION PASSAGE BUT HERE THEY WERE STOPPED EVERYBODY ACQUAINTED WITH BATH MAY REMEMBER THE DIFFICULTIES OF CROSSING CHEAP STREET AT THIS POINT
HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT AT LEAST ONE OF HER MEN HAD REMAINED FAITHFUL A MAN STEPPED QUIETLY FROM THE INNER SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ADVANCED WITH THE UNCERTAIN TREAD OF ONE WHO IS OVERCOME BY AMAZEMENT HE WAS A STRANGER
CONFESSED BEVERLY THE CHIEF OF THE HONEST MEN LAUGHED AGAIN A CLEAR RINGING LAUGH THAT BESPOKE SUPREME CONFIDENCE IN HIS RIGHT TO ENJOY HIMSELF AND WHO IS AUNT FANNY HE ASKED
BUT SHE FORCED OPEN THE STUBBORN COACHDOOR AND SCRAMBLED TO THE GROUND LOOKING FRANTICALLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR A SINGLE SIGN OF HOPE IN THE MOST DESPAIRING TERROR SHE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED SHE STARTED TOWARD THE LEAD HORSES
CALLING OUT TO HIS COMPANIONS IN A LANGUAGE STRANGE TO BEVERLY HE CRACKED THE WHIP AND ONCE MORE THEY WERE LUMBERING OVER THE WRETCHED ROAD BEVERLY SANK BACK INTO THE SEAT WITH A DEEP SIGH OF RESIGNATION WELL I'M IN FOR IT SHE THOUGHT
WE HAVE ONLY THE BEST OF MOTIVES IN MIND TRUE THE HILLS ARE FULL OF LAWLESS FELLOWS AND WE ARE OBLIGED TO FIGHT THEM ALMOST DAILY BUT YOU HAVE FALLEN IN WITH HONEST MEN VERY NICE GENTLEMEN I TRUST LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO WE PUT A BAND OF ROBBERS TO FLIGHT
IT IS INDEED A STREET OF SO IMPERTINENT A NATURE SO UNFORTUNATELY CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT LONDON AND OXFORD ROADS AND THE PRINCIPAL INN OF THE CITY THAT A DAY NEVER PASSES IN WHICH PARTIES OF LADIES HOWEVER IMPORTANT THEIR BUSINESS
WHY SHE'S A NEGRESS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT A COLORED PERSON IS YOU MEAN SHE IS A SLAVE A BLACK SLAVE WE DON'T OWN SLAVES ANY MO' MORE HE LOOKED MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER
VERY VERY MUCH INDEED ISABELLA PARTICULARLY
THEN AT LAST TO SATISFY HIMSELF WALKED OVER AND PEERED INTO THE COACH AUNT FANNY SET UP A DISMAL HOWL AN INSTANT LATER SIR HONESTY WAS PUSHED ASIDE AND MISS CALHOUN WAS ANXIOUSLY TRYING TO COMFORT HER OLD FRIEND THROUGH THE WINDOW
AND WORE AN ODD UNCOUTH GARB THE FAILING LIGHT TOLD HER THAT HE WAS NOT ONE OF HER LATE PROTECTORS SHE SHRANK BACK WITH A FAINT CRY OF ALARM READY TO FLY TO THE PROTECTING ARMS OF HOPELESS AUNT FANNY IF HER UNCERTAIN LEGS COULD CARRY HER
AFTER LISTENING AND AGREEING AS LONG AS SHE COULD WITH ALL THE CIVILITY AND DEFERENCE OF THE YOUTHFUL FEMALE MIND FEARFUL OF HAZARDING AN OPINION OF ITS OWN IN OPPOSITION TO THAT OF A SELF ASSURED MAN ESPECIALLY WHERE THE BEAUTY OF HER OWN SEX IS CONCERNED
PLEASE PLEASE DON'T HURT HER COMPOSE YOURSELF SHE IS SAFE SAID THE LEADER BY THIS TIME IT WAS QUITE DARK AT A WORD FROM HIM TWO OR THREE MEN LIGHTED LANTERNS THE PICTURE WAS MORE WEIRD THAN EVER IN THE FITFUL GLOW
NOT I FAITH NO IF I READ ANY IT SHALL BE MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S HER NOVELS ARE AMUSING ENOUGH THEY ARE WORTH READING SOME FUN AND NATURE IN THEM UDOLPHO WAS WRITTEN BY MISSUS RADCLIFFE SAID CATHERINE
HE CRIED WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND TOWARD HIS COMPANIONS BEVERLY LOOKED DUBIOUS
IT WAS HAVE YOU EVER READ UDOLPHO MISTER THORPE UDOLPHO OH LORD NOT I I NEVER READ NOVELS I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO CATHERINE HUMBLED AND ASHAMED
IT WOULD BE USELESS TO DENY THE STORY THESE MEN WOULD NOT BELIEVE HER IN A FLASH
A THIRD INDEED NO NO I DID NOT COME TO BATH TO DRIVE MY SISTERS ABOUT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD JOKE FAITH MORLAND MUST TAKE CARE OF YOU THIS BROUGHT ON A DIALOGUE OF CIVILITIES BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO
I HAVE NEVER READ IT YOU HAD NO LOSS I ASSURE YOU IT IS THE HORRIDEST NONSENSE YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD IN IT BUT AN OLD MAN'S PLAYING AT SEE SAW AND LEARNING LATIN UPON MY SOUL THERE IS NOT
UNCONSCIOUSLY THIS SLIM SPRIG OF SOUTHERN VALOR THREW BACK HER SHOULDERS AND LIFTED HER CHIN IF THEY WERE BRIGANDS THEY SHOULD NOT FIND HER A CRINGING COWARD AFTER ALL SHE WAS A CALHOUN
MAY I ASK YOUR HIGHNESS HOW DO YOU INTEND TO REACH EDELWEISS IN YOUR PRESENT CONDITION
AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE DID MISS MORLAND I AM SURE I CANNOT GUESS AT ALL CURRICLE HUNG YOU SEE SEAT TRUNK SWORD CASE SPLASHING BOARD LAMPS SILVER MOULDING ALL YOU SEE COMPLETE THE IRON WORK AS GOOD AS NEW OR BETTER
IT REQUIRES UNCOMMON STEADINESS OF REASON TO RESIST THE ATTRACTION OF BEING CALLED THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD
YOUR ESCORT HAS FLED AS THOUGH PURSUED BY SOMETHING STRONGER THAN SHADOWS YOUR DRIVER HAS DESERTED YOUR HORSES ARE HALF DEAD YOU ARE INDEED AS YOU HAVE SAID POWERLESS AND YOU ARE BESIDES ALL THESE
AND I DEFY ANY MAN IN ENGLAND TO MAKE MY HORSE GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR IN HARNESS THAT MAKES IT EXACTLY TWENTY FIVE YOU HAVE LOST AN HOUR SAID MORLAND IT WAS ONLY TEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE CAME FROM TETBURY TEN O'CLOCK
I WOULD NOT SELL MY HORSE FOR A HUNDRED ARE YOU FOND OF AN OPEN CARRIAGE MISS MORLAND YES VERY I HAVE HARDLY EVER AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING IN ONE BUT I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF IT I AM GLAD OF IT I WILL DRIVE YOU OUT IN MINE EVERY DAY
IF THE MAN HEARD HER HE GAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THE FACT HIS FACE WAS SET FORWARD AND HE WAS GUIDING THE HORSES WITH A FIRM UNQUIVERING HAND THE COACH RATTLED AND BOUNDED ALONG THE DANGEROUS WAY HEWN IN THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
I TOOK UP THE FIRST VOLUME ONCE AND LOOKED IT OVER BUT I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO INDEED I GUESSED WHAT SORT OF STUFF IT MUST BE BEFORE I SAW IT
WITH ITS GALLANT SMILE AND OMINOUS PATCH SHE HESITATED FEAR ENTERING HER SOUL ONCE MORE
HE WORE THE EXPRESSION OF A MAN TRAPPED AND SEEKING MEANS OF ESCAPE SUDDENLY HE DARTED BEHIND THE COACH ALMOST BRUSHING AGAINST BEVERLY'S HAT AS HE PASSED THE WINDOW SHE OPENED HER LIPS TO CALL TO HIM BUT EVEN AS SHE DID SO HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS
AND TOO MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN UNLESS HE WERE EASY WHERE HE OUGHT TO BE CIVIL AND IMPUDENT WHERE HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE EASY HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IT FROM TETBURY MISS MORLAND I DO NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE
I AM POWERLESS I ONLY IMPLORE YOU TO TAKE WHAT VALUABLES YOU MAY FIND AND LET US PROCEED UNHARMED SHE CRIED RAPIDLY EAGER TO HAVE IT OVER PRAY HOW CAN YOUR HIGHNESS PROCEED YOU HAVE NO GUIDE NO DRIVER NO ESCORT
HE ASKED FIFTY GUINEAS I CLOSED WITH HIM DIRECTLY THREW DOWN THE MONEY AND THE CARRIAGE WAS MINE AND I AM SURE SAID CATHERINE
AS THEY MET MISSUS THORPE WHO HAD DESCRIED THEM FROM ABOVE IN THE PASSAGE AH MOTHER HOW DO YOU DO SAID HE GIVING HER A HEARTY SHAKE OF THE HAND WHERE DID YOU GET THAT QUIZ OF A HAT IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE AN OLD WITCH
A PROLONGED GROAN PROVED TO BEVERLY THAT AUNT FANNY HAD SCREWED UP SUFFICIENT COURAGE TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW MY OLD SERVANT SHE HALF WHISPERED THEN AS SEVERAL OF THE MEN STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR BUT SHE IS OLD AND WOULDN'T HARM A FLY
BUT HIS FRIEND DISREGARDED THEM ALL HE HAD A SURER TEST OF DISTANCE I KNOW IT MUST BE FIVE AND TWENTY SAID HE BY THE TIME WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT IT IS NOW HALF AFTER ONE WE DROVE OUT OF THE INN YARD AT TETBURY AS THE TOWN CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN
EVEN THE HILLS HAVE EYES AND EARS BEVERLY LISTENED WITH INCREASING PERPLEXITY IT WAS TRUE THAT SHE HAD LEFT SAINT PETERSBURG ON SUNDAY THAT THE UNPRECEDENTED FLOODS HAD STOPPED ALL RAILWAY TRAFFIC IN THE HILLS
AND THREADING THE GUTTERS OF THAT INTERESTING ALLEY
AND LESS SIMPLY ENGROSSED BY HER OWN THAT HER BROTHER THOUGHT HER FRIEND QUITE AS PRETTY AS SHE COULD DO HERSELF JOHN THORPE WHO IN THE MEANTIME HAD BEEN GIVING ORDERS ABOUT THE HORSES SOON JOINED THEM AND FROM HIM SHE DIRECTLY RECEIVED THE AMENDS WHICH WERE HER DUE
AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
IT IS GETTING LATE AND YOUR RETINUE AT LEAST IS HUNGRY HE FLUNG OPEN THE COACH DOOR AND HIS HAT SWEPT THE GROUND ONCE MORE THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN PLAYED FITFULLY UPON HIS DARK GAUNT FACE
I'M I'M NOT AFRAID BRAVELY SHIVERED BEVERLY IT IS MOST DANGEROUS I HAVE A REVOLVER THE WEAK LITTLE VOICE WENT ON OHO WHAT IS IT FOR
EVERY MAN YOU MEET IN GRAUSTARK IS NOT A BRIGAND I TRUST FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE SIMPLE HUNTERS AND NOT WHAT WE MAY SEEM IT IS FORTUNATE THAT YOU HAVE FALLEN INTO HONEST HANDS THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE COACH HE ASKED QUICKLY ALERT
YOU WON'T KILL US SHE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE THAT THERE WERE SMILES ON THE FACES OF ALL THE MEN WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT REST ASSURED YOUR HIGHNESS SAID THE LEADER LEANING UPON HIS RIFLE BARREL WITH CARELESS GRACE WE INTEND NO HARM TO YOU
HER TENDER BODY TOSSED FURIOUSLY ABOUT WITH THE SWAY OF THE VEHICLE
THE ONLY REWARD I CAN ASK IS FORGIVENESS FOR TRESPASSING UPON THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS YOU SHALL RECEIVE PARDON FOR ALL TRANSGRESSIONS BUT YOU MUST GET ME TO SOME PLACE OF SAFETY SAID BEVERLY EAGERLY AND QUICKLY TOO YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE ADDED
AND THEN THE COACH STOPPED WITH A MIGHTY LURCH DRAGGING HERSELF FROM THE CORNER POOR BEVERLY CALHOUN NO LONGER A DISDAINFUL HEROINE
EXPECTING THE MURDEROUS BLADE OF THE DRIVER TO MEET HER AS SHE DID SO PAULOFF HAD SWUNG FROM THE BOX OF THE COACH AND WAS PEERING FIRST INTO THE WOODLAND BELOW
FOR SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE MOST DELIGHTED AND EXULTING AFFECTION ON HIS TWO YOUNGER SISTERS HE THEN BESTOWED AN EQUAL PORTION OF HIS FRATERNAL TENDERNESS FOR HE ASKED EACH OF THEM HOW THEY DID
BUT THIS DETESTATION THOUGH SO JUST WAS OF SHORT DURATION FOR SHE LOOKED AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED DELIGHTFUL MISTER MORLAND AND MY BROTHER GOOD HEAVEN TIS JAMES WAS UTTERED AT THE SAME MOMENT BY CATHERINE
SET OFF TO WALK TOGETHER TO MISTER ALLEN'S AND JAMES AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON THEM SAID WELL CATHERINE HOW DO YOU LIKE MY FRIEND THORPE INSTEAD OF ANSWERING AS SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE HAD THERE BEEN NO FRIENDSHIP AND NO FLATTERY IN THE CASE I DO NOT LIKE HIM AT ALL
OH MOANED BEVERLY SUDDENLY LEANING AGAINST THE FORE WHEEL HER EYES ALMOST STARTING FROM HER HEAD THE LEADER LAUGHED QUIETLY YES GOOD NATUREDLY OH YOU WON'T
AND BESIDES YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WAY AREN'T YOU GOING TO ROB US DEMANDED BEVERLY HOPE SPRINGING TO THE SURFACE WITH A JOYFUL BOUND THE STRANGER LAUGHED HEARTILY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD DO WE NOT LOOK LIKE HONEST MEN
SHE IS JUST THE KIND OF YOUNG WOMAN I COULD WISH TO SEE YOU ATTACHED TO SHE HAS SO MUCH GOOD SENSE AND IS SO THOROUGHLY UNAFFECTED AND AMIABLE I ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO KNOW HER AND SHE SEEMS VERY FOND OF YOU SHE SAID THE HIGHEST THINGS IN YOUR PRAISE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT ONE WHO LOOKED AS THOUGH HE POSSESSED A COMPLETE OUTFIT OF WEARING APPAREL POOR WAYFARERS MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS REPLIED THE TALL VAGABOND BOWING LOW TO HER SURPRISE HE SPOKE IN VERY GOOD ENGLISH HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR
BUT CATHERINE HEARD NEITHER THE PARTICULARS NOR THE RESULT HER COMPANION'S DISCOURSE NOW SUNK FROM ITS HITHERTO ANIMATED PITCH TO NOTHING MORE THAN A SHORT DECISIVE SENTENCE OF PRAISE OR CONDEMNATION ON THE FACE OF EVERY WOMAN THEY MET AND CATHERINE
WHETHER IN QUEST OF PASTRY MILLINERY OR EVEN AS IN THE PRESENT CASE OF YOUNG MEN ARE NOT DETAINED ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER BY CARRIAGES HORSEMEN OR CARTS
HE SAID LIGHTLY THE HORSES HAVE RESTED I THINK
BUT WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED US IN THIS MANNER STOPPED YOU CRIED THE MAN WITH THE PATCH I IMPLORE YOU TO UNSAY THAT YOUR HIGHNESS
RENEWED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HIS GIG YOU WILL FIND HOWEVER MISS MORLAND IT WOULD BE RECKONED A CHEAP THING BY SOME PEOPLE FOR I MIGHT HAVE SOLD IT FOR TEN GUINEAS MORE THE NEXT DAY JACKSON OF ORIEL BID ME SIXTY AT ONCE MORLAND WAS WITH ME AT THE TIME
I WILL DRIVE YOU UP LANSDOWN HILL TOMORROW THANK YOU BUT WILL NOT YOUR HORSE WANT REST REST HE HAS ONLY COME THREE AND TWENTY MILES TODAY ALL NONSENSE NOTHING RUINS HORSES SO MUCH AS REST NOTHING KNOCKS THEM UP SO SOON
IS NOT SHE YES VERY MUCH INDEED I FANCY MISTER ALLEN THINKS HER THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN BATH I DARE SAY HE DOES AND I DO NOT KNOW ANY MAN WHO IS A BETTER JUDGE OF BEAUTY THAN MISTER ALLEN
PREVENTED HIS ACCEPTING THE INVITATION OF ONE FRIEND AND OBLIGED HIM TO HURRY AWAY AS SOON AS HE HAD SATISFIED THE DEMANDS OF THE OTHER
THIS CRITIQUE THE JUSTNESS OF WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON POOR CATHERINE BROUGHT THEM TO THE DOOR OF MISSUS THORPE'S LODGINGS AND THE FEELINGS OF THE DISCERNING AND UNPREJUDICED READER OF CAMILLA GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS OF THE DUTIFUL AND AFFECTIONATE SON
IN AFTER LIFE SHE WAS ABLE TO PICTURE IN HER MIND'S EYE ALL THE DETAILS OF THAT TABLEAU IN THE MOUNTAIN PASS THE HOPELESS COACH THE STEAMING HORSES THE RAKISH BANDIT AND HIS PICTURESQUE MEN THE TOWERING CRAGS
THESE MANNERS DID NOT PLEASE CATHERINE BUT HE WAS JAMES'S FRIEND AND ISABELLA'S BROTHER AND HER JUDGMENT WAS FURTHER BOUGHT OFF BY ISABELLA'S ASSURING HER WHEN THEY WITHDREW TO SEE THE NEW HAT THAT JOHN THOUGHT HER THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD
YES SAID MORLAND WHO OVERHEARD THIS BUT YOU FORGET THAT YOUR HORSE WAS INCLUDED MY HORSE
I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN CAMILLA YES
SHE DIRECTLY REPLIED I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH HE SEEMS VERY AGREEABLE HE IS AS GOOD NATURED A FELLOW AS EVER LIVED A LITTLE OF A RATTLE BUT THAT WILL RECOMMEND HIM TO YOUR SEX I BELIEVE AND HOW DO YOU LIKE THE REST OF THE FAMILY
COVERING HIS PATCH CAREFULLY WITH HIS SLOUCHING HAT MY SERVANT SHE'S COLORED COLORED HE ASKED IN AMAZEMENT
AND THIS ADDRESS
COMPELLING HER TO TRAVEL FOR MANY MILES BY STAGE AND THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS CONFUSING HER IN SOME STRANGE WAY WITH THE PRINCESS YETIVE THE NEWS HAD EVIDENTLY SPED THROUGH AXPHAIN AND THE HILLS WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF FIRE
AND SAVE HIMSELF WITHOUT A THOUGHT FOR THE VICTIMS INSIDE STOP TURN AROUND SHE CRIED IN A FRENZY
THE MAN SHE HAD FIRST OBSERVED STOPPED NEAR THE HORSES HEADS AND PEERED INTENTLY AT HER FROM BENEATH A BROAD AND RAKISH HAT HE WAS TALL AND APPEARED TO BE MORE RESPECTABLY CLAD THAN HIS FELLOWS
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY ARE THIEVES OR ANGELS I RECKON I'LL HAVE TO TAKE WHAT COMES HE DOESN'T LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE AN ANGEL
IT WAS ELEVEN UPON MY SOUL I COUNTED EVERY STROKE THIS BROTHER OF YOURS WOULD PERSUADE ME OUT OF MY SENSES MISS MORLAND DO BUT LOOK AT MY HORSE
I KNOW OF A PLACE WHERE YOU MAY SPEND THE NIGHT COMFORTABLY AND BE REFRESHED FOR THE ROUGH JOURNEY TO MORROW TO MORROW HOW CAN I GO ON I AM ALONE SHE CRIED DESPAIRINGLY
CRIED SHE NOW ABLE TO THINK MORE CLEARLY AND YOU ARE MILES FROM AN INN OR HOUSE OF ANY KIND HE WENT ON
LOOK AT HIS LOINS ONLY SEE HOW HE MOVES THAT HORSE CANNOT GO LESS THAN TEN MILES AN HOUR TIE HIS LEGS AND HE WILL GET ON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY GIG MISS MORLAND
LOOK AT THAT CREATURE AND SUPPOSE IT POSSIBLE IF YOU CAN HE DOES LOOK VERY HOT TO BE SURE HOT HE HAD NOT TURNED A HAIR TILL WE CAME TO WALCOT CHURCH
ASKED THE LEADER PUTTING AWAY HIS BRIEF SHOW OF INDIGNATION
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A TOLERABLY DECENT ONE COME OUT SINCE TOM JONES EXCEPT THE MONK I READ THAT T'OTHER DAY BUT AS FOR ALL THE OTHERS THEY ARE THE STUPIDEST THINGS IN CREATION I THINK YOU MUST LIKE UDOLPHO IF YOU WERE TO READ IT IT IS SO VERY INTERESTING
JAMES ACCEPTED THIS TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE AND QUALIFIED HIS CONSCIENCE FOR ACCEPTING IT TOO BY SAYING WITH PERFECT SINCERITY INDEED CATHERINE I LOVE YOU DEARLY
BEING CORRECTLY ADJUSTED CATHERINE WAS THEN LEFT TO THE LUXURY OF A RAISED RESTLESS AND FRIGHTENED IMAGINATION OVER THE PAGES OF UDOLPHO
THE TEARS WERE WELLING TO HER EYES
AT THE SAME INSTANT ANOTHER RAGGED STRANGER THEN TWO THREE FOUR OR FIVE APPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC SOME NEAR HER OTHERS APPROACHING FROM THE SHADOWS WHO
I OH YOUR HIGHNESS I AM BALDOS THE GOAT HUNTER A POOR SUBJECT FOR REWARD AT YOUR HANDS I MAY AS WELL ADMIT THAT I AM A POACHER AND HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT TO THE PROSPERITY OF YOUR HILLS
YES VERY KIND I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY BEFORE
AND BY JOHN'S ENGAGING HER BEFORE THEY PARTED TO DANCE WITH HIM THAT EVENING HAD SHE BEEN OLDER OR VAINER SUCH ATTACKS MIGHT HAVE DONE LITTLE
THANK YOU SAID CATHERINE
OUT DOOR LIFE IS NECESSARY FOR OUR HEALTH
I HEARD THE SHOOTING CRIED BEVERLY IT WAS THAT WHICH PUT MY ESCORT TO FLIGHT THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SOLDIERS OF GRAUSTARK THEN YOUR HIGHNESS QUITE GALLANTLY THEY WERE COSSACKS OR WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM
BUT APART FROM THIS HER QUICK BRAIN WAS EVOLVING ALL SORTS OF POSSIBLE ENDINGS NONE SHORT OF ABSOLUTE DISASTER EVEN AS SHE PRAYED THAT SOMETHING MIGHT INTERVENE TO CHECK THE MAD RUSH
CATHERINE BY WHOM THIS MEETING WAS WHOLLY UNEXPECTED RECEIVED HER BROTHER WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND HE BEING OF A VERY AMIABLE DISPOSITION AND SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HER GAVE EVERY PROOF ON HIS SIDE OF EQUAL SATISFACTION
BUT I CHANCED TO MEET HIM ON MAGDALEN BRIDGE AS HE WAS DRIVING INTO OXFORD LAST TERM AH THORPE SAID HE DO YOU HAPPEN TO WANT SUCH A LITTLE THING AS THIS IT IS A CAPITAL ONE OF THE KIND BUT I AM CURSED TIRED OF IT
THE RAUCOUS VOICE OF THE DRIVER WAS HEARD CALLING TO HIS HORSES
LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET FROM WHERE THE COACH WAS STANDING HE TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND WAS LOST AMONG THE ROCKS AHEAD FOUR HORSES COVERED WITH SWEAT WERE PANTING AND HEAVING AS IF IN GREAT DISTRESS AFTER THEIR MAD RUN
WHO IN HEAVEN'S NAME ARE YOU SHE FALTERED
YOU DO US A GRAVE INJUSTICE IT'S VERY STRANGE MUTTERED BEVERLY SOMEWHAT TAKEN ABACK
THE SERVANT HAD JUST MOUNTED THE CARRIAGE AND WAS DRIVING OFF SUCH TRUE BLOOD
WHICH HE COULD HAVE LEISURE TO DO WHILE THE BRIGHT EYES OF MISS THORPE WERE INCESSANTLY CHALLENGING HIS NOTICE AND TO HER HIS DEVOIRS WERE SPEEDILY PAID WITH A MIXTURE OF JOY AND EMBARRASSMENT WHICH MIGHT HAVE INFORMED CATHERINE
THE SITUATION OF SOME THE GROWTH OF THE REST AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS NOW PASSED BETWEEN THEM AND CONTINUED WITH ONLY ONE SMALL DIGRESSION ON JAMES'S PART IN PRAISE OF MISS THORPE TILL THEY REACHED PULTENEY STREET
WE ARE NOT SO FAR FROM THE WORLD AFTER ALL WE ROUGH PEOPLE OF THE HILLS
THE AIR WAS LADEN WITH THE GERMS OF TYPHOID
WHO LAUGHED AT HIMSELF AND CALLED HIMSELF THE ASS OF THE FABLE REMAINING LIKE THAT ANIMAL UNDECIDED WHICH HAYCOCK TO TURN TO AT ANY RATE BEFORE I GET AN ANSWER FROM MARY VASILIEVNA
BEGAN BEATING HER KATUSHA DEFENDED HERSELF AND THEY HAD A FIGHT
AND SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE
TURNING HALF ROUND WHEN I DROVE UP AND THE SWISS AT THE DOOR SAYS JUST GONE THE ISVOSTCHIK KNEW THAT NEKHLUDOFF VISITED AT THE KORCHAGINS AND CALLED THERE ON THE CHANCE OF BEING ENGAGED BY HIM
PUTREFACTION AND TAR EVERY NEWCOMER FELT SAD AND DEJECTED IN IT THE WOMAN WARDER FELT THIS THOUGH SHE WAS USED TO BAD AIR SHE HAD JUST COME IN FROM OUTSIDE
AND THE BRILLIANT CORROBORATION OF WHICH HE HAD AT A LATER PERIOD FOUND IN THE WORKS OF HENRY GEORGE
WELL IT COULD NOT BE WORSE THAN IT IS NOW ANYHOW I ONLY WISH IT WAS SETTLED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
HIS MOTHER LAID ALL THE BLAME ON KATUSHA AND GAVE HER NOTICE IT SO HAPPENED THAT AFTER MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS TO FIND A SITUATION KATUSHA AGAIN WENT TO THE REGISTRY OFFICE
LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE JAILER READY TO COMPLY WITH ANY ORDER THE JAILER WAS ABOUT TO LOCK THE DOOR
HAVING REFRESHED HIS FULL WHITE MUSCULAR BODY AND DRIED IT WITH A ROUGH BATH SHEET HE PUT ON HIS FINE UNDERGARMENTS AND HIS BOOTS AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE GLASS TO BRUSH HIS BLACK BEARD AND HIS CURLY HAIR
HER SMALL BROAD HANDS AND FULL NECK WHICH SHOWED FROM UNDER THE BROAD COLLAR OF HER CLOAK WERE OF THE SAME HUE HER BLACK SPARKLING EYES ONE WITH A SLIGHT SQUINT
AND EXPLAINED IT BY HIS TOO FINELY DEVELOPED AESTHETIC TASTE STILL THE FEELING WAS A VERY UNPLEASANT ONE SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THIS HE HAD GIVEN UP MILITARY SERVICE FEELING SURE THAT HE HAD A TALENT FOR ART
THIS UNMARRIED WOMAN HAD A BABY EVERY YEAR AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS AMONG THE VILLAGE PEOPLE
THE ELDER A BIG FELLOW WITH MOUSTACHES
PRINCE DMITRI IVANOVITCH NEKHLUDOFF WHO HAD SEDUCED HER WAS STILL LYING ON HIS HIGH BEDSTEAD WITH A FEATHER BED ON THE TOP OF THE SPRING MATTRESS IN A FINE CLEAN WELL IRONED LINEN NIGHT SHIRT
SHE WORE LINEN STOCKINGS AND PRISON SHOES AND ROUND HER HEAD WAS TIED A WHITE KERCHIEF FROM UNDER WHICH A FEW LOCKS OF BLACK HAIR WERE BRUSHED OVER THE FOREHEAD
I NEVER MEANT TO GET OUT OF IT REPLIED NEKHLUDOFF GLOOMILY AND IN A TONE OF SEVERITY WELL I CALL THIS BEING PUBLIC SPIRITED BUT JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU GET HUNGRY OR SLEEPY YOU'LL SING TO ANOTHER TUNE THEN
THE SIXTH BABY WHOSE FATHER WAS A GIPSY TRAMP WOULD HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE HAD IT NOT SO HAPPENED THAT ONE OF THE MAIDEN LADIES CAME INTO THE FARMYARD TO SCOLD THE DAIRYMAIDS FOR SENDING UP CREAM THAT SMELT OF THE COW
BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES
AND WALKED AWAY WITH SUCH A LOOK OF SADNESS ON HIS FACE AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN NATURAL IF HE HAD JUST HEARD OF THE DEATH OF ALL HIS RELATIONS HE CAME UP TO A GROUP THAT HAD FORMED ITSELF ROUND A CLEAN SHAVEN TALL DIGNIFIED MAN
MOREOVER HE HAD FORMED LUXURIOUS HABITS WHICH HE COULD NOT EASILY GIVE UP BESIDES HE HAD NO LONGER THE SAME INDUCEMENTS
AS THE FACT THAT IT GAVE HER A CHANCE OF FORGETTING THE MISERY SHE SUFFERED
AND FARM ALL THE LAND NOW RENTED BY THE PEASANTS THEMSELVES THE STEWARD WROTE THAT THIS WOULD BE A FAR MORE PROFITABLE WAY OF MANAGING THE PROPERTY
AND HE TAKING IT AS HIS DUE AS HE ALWAYS DID WHEN AMONG STRANGERS HAD HE BEEN ASKED WHY HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ABOVE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HE COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN AN ANSWER
BESIDE THE USUAL HESITATION OF MEN PAST THEIR YOUTH TO MARRY UNLESS THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN LOVE
BECAUSE NEKHLUDOFF HAD BEEN AN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRER OF HENRY GEORGE AND HERBERT SPENCER BEING HIMSELF HEIR TO A LARGE PROPERTY HE WAS ESPECIALLY STRUCK BY THE POSITION TAKEN UP BY SPENCER IN SOCIAL STATICS
FOR THE TIME OF HER CONFINEMENT WAS DRAWING NEAR
MASLOVA'S MOTHER WAS THE UNMARRIED DAUGHTER OF A VILLAGE WOMAN
SMOKING A CIGARETTE AND CONSIDERING WHAT HE HAD TO DO TO DAY AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED YESTERDAY RECALLING THE EVENING HE HAD SPENT WITH THE KORCHAGINS
AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO PROPOSE TO KORCHAGIN EVEN IF HE HAD WISHED TO DO SO AMONG THE LETTERS ON THE TABLE WAS ONE FROM THIS WOMAN'S HUSBAND SEEING HIS WRITING AND THE POSTMARK
SHE HAD LIVED WITH THE NEKHLUDOFFS FROM THE TIME SHE WAS A CHILD AND HAD KNOWN DMITRI IVANOVITCH AT THE TIME WHEN HE WAS STILL LITTLE MITINKA GOOD MORNING DMITRI IVANOVITCH GOOD MORNING AGRAPHENA PETROVNA
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IN FAVOUR OF MARRYING MISSY HER NAME WAS MARY BUT AS IS USUAL AMONG A CERTAIN SET A NICKNAME HAD BEEN GIVEN HER WAS THAT SHE CAME OF GOOD FAMILY AND DIFFERED IN EVERYTHING
YES MY DEAR SIR THIS IS IT ONE OF US ON THE JURY ARE YOU ASKED THE MERCHANT WITH A MERRY WINK
A PEASANT WHO HAD SOLD HIS CHARCOAL AND HAD HAD SOME TEA IN THE TOWN CAME UP AND AFTER CROSSING HIMSELF GAVE HER A COPECK THE PRISONER BLUSHED AND MUTTERED SOMETHING
ALSO THE TERRIBLE SCENE HE HAD WITH HER WHEN SHE RAN OUT INTO THE PARK AND IN HER EXCITEMENT TRIED TO DROWN HERSELF IN THE POND
WAS OF THE BEST QUALITY VERY QUIET SIMPLE DURABLE AND COSTLY NEKHLUDOFF DRESSED LEISURELY AND WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM
HIS VULGARITY IN SHORT AH HA YOU'RE ALSO TRAPPED THESE WERE THE WORDS ACCOMPANIED WITH BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER WITH WHICH PETER GERASIMOVITCH GREETED NEKHLUDOFF HAVE YOU NOT MANAGED TO GET OUT OF IT
AND TOLD HER THAT THE MAN WAS AN AUTHOR AND THAT HE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND THAT IF HE LIKED HER HE WOULD NOT GRUDGE HER ANYTHING HE DID LIKE HER AND GAVE HER TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES PROMISING TO SEE HER OFTEN
HE PRESSED THE BUTTON OF AN ELECTRIC BELL AND HIS SERVANT AN ELDERLY MOROSE LOOKING MAN WITH WHISKERS AND SHAVED CHIN AND LIP WEARING A GREY COTTON APRON ENTERED AT THE DOOR SEND TO FETCH AN ISVOSTCHIK PLEASE YES SIR
IT FLUTTERED UP AND FLEW CLOSE TO HER EAR FANNING HER WITH ITS WINGS
AND CONSIDERING IT WRONG TO HOLD LANDED PROPERTY
TO THE PEASANTS INHERITING HIS MOTHER'S LARGE ESTATES AND THUS BECOMING A LANDED PROPRIETOR HE HAD TO CHOOSE ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER TO GIVE UP HIS PROPERTY AS HE HAD GIVEN UP HIS FATHER'S LAND TEN YEARS BEFORE
MISSY WHEN NEKHLUDOFF HAD FINISHED HIS COFFEE HE WENT TO HIS STUDY TO LOOK AT THE SUMMONS AND FIND OUT WHAT TIME HE WAS TO APPEAR AT THE COURT BEFORE WRITING HIS ANSWER TO THE PRINCESS PASSING THROUGH HIS STUDIO
AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO A SMALL YOUNG WOMAN WITH A VERY FULL BUST CAME BRISKLY OUT OF THE DOOR AND WENT UP TO THE JAILER SHE HAD ON A GREY CLOAK OVER A WHITE JACKET AND PETTICOAT ON HER FEET
NEKHLUDOFF NEVER KNEW HIS SURNAME AND EVEN BRAGGED A BIT ABOUT THIS THIS MAN WAS NOW A MASTER AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL NEKHLUDOFF COULD NOT STAND HIS FAMILIARITY HIS SELF SATISFIED LAUGHTER
WITHOUT BEING PAID HER WAGES
FROM INSIDE THE CELL CAME THE SOUND OF BUSTLE AND WOMEN'S VOICES AND THE PATTER OF BARE FEET ON THE FLOOR
WROTE ONLY TO LET NEKHLUDOFF KNOW THAT THERE WAS TO BE A SPECIAL MEETING TOWARDS THE END OF MAY AND THAT NEKHLUDOFF WAS TO BE SURE AND COME TO
HE GAVE HER ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES AND OFFERED HER A SEPARATE LODGING NEXT DOOR TO THE LODGING RENTED FOR HER BY THE AUTHOR THERE LIVED A JOLLY YOUNG SHOPMAN WITH WHOM KATUSHA SOON FELL IN LOVE SHE TOLD THE AUTHOR
THE WOMAN RECEIVED HER VERY KINDLY SET CAKE AND SWEET WINE BEFORE HER THEN WROTE A NOTE AND GAVE IT TO A SERVANT TO TAKE TO SOMEBODY IN THE EVENING A TALL MAN WITH LONG GREY HAIR AND A WHITE BEARD
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT NEKHLUDOFF ASKED A LETTER FROM THE PRINCESS EITHER FROM THE MOTHER OR THE DAUGHTER THE MAID BROUGHT IT SOME TIME AGO AND IS WAITING IN MY ROOM
WERE GONE AS TO THE SECOND COURSE THAT OF DENYING THOSE CLEAR AND UNANSWERABLE PROOFS OF THE INJUSTICE OF LANDHOLDING WHICH HE HAD DRAWN FROM SPENCER'S SOCIAL STATICS
YES SIR IT IS NOT VERY POLITE BUT I CAN'T WRITE NO MATTER I SHALL SEE HER TODAY THOUGHT NEKHLUDOFF AND WENT TO GET HIS OVERCOAT WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AN ISVOSTCHIK HE KNEW
WAS TO NEKHLUDOFF A PROOF OF HER GOOD SENSE AND CORRECT JUDGMENT AGAINST MARRYING MISSY IN PARTICULAR WAS THAT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GIRL WITH EVEN HIGHER QUALITIES COULD BE FOUND THAT SHE WAS ALREADY TWENTY SEVEN
WHO WAS RECOUNTING SOMETHING WITH GREAT ANIMATION THIS MAN WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TRIAL GOING ON IN THE CIVIL COURT AS OF A CASE WELL KNOWN TO HIMSELF MENTIONING THE JUDGES AND A CELEBRATED ADVOCATE BY NAME
THIS LETTER WAS PARTLY DISAGREEABLE AND PARTLY PLEASANT IT WAS PLEASANT TO FEEL THAT HE HAD POWER OVER SO LARGE A PROPERTY AND YET DISAGREEABLE
WHICH THERE IS THE CIVIL COURT AND THE CRIMINAL COURT I AM ON THE JURY THE CRIMINAL COURT YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID HERE TO THE RIGHT THEN TO THE LEFT THE SECOND DOOR NEKHLUDOFF FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION
AND BEGAN SPEAKING TO MASLOVA BUT THE JAILER CLOSED THE DOOR PUSHING THE OLD WOMAN'S HEAD WITH IT A WOMAN'S LAUGHTER WAS HEARD FROM THE CELL AND MASLOVA SMILED
AND THAT HE WAS HARDLY HER FIRST LOVE THIS LAST IDEA WAS PAINFUL TO HIM HIS PRIDE WOULD NOT RECONCILE ITSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD LOVED SOME ONE ELSE EVEN IN THE PAST
ALL WERE GLAD THE PLANTS THE BIRDS THE INSECTS AND THE CHILDREN BUT MEN GROWN UP MEN AND WOMEN DID NOT LEAVE OFF CHEATING AND TORMENTING THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER
THEY DESCENDED THE STONE STAIRS
IT WAS NOT THE FACT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS HAD RECEIVED THE GRACE AND GLADNESS OF SPRING THAT WAS CONSIDERED SACRED AND IMPORTANT BUT THAT A NOTICE NUMBERED AND WITH A SUPERSCRIPTION HAD COME THE DAY BEFORE
THE OTHER LETTER WAS FROM HIS STEWARD THE STEWARD WROTE TO TELL HIM THAT A VISIT TO HIS ESTATES WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENTER INTO POSSESSION AND ALSO TO DECIDE ABOUT THE FURTHER MANAGEMENT OF HIS LANDS
AND SPENT ALL HE COULD LAY HANDS ON AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE
AND WAS ABOUT TO GO AWAY BUT SEEING THE BABY HER HEART WAS TOUCHED
HE WAS SAYING THAT IT SEEMED WONDERFUL HOW THE CELEBRATED ADVOCATE HAD MANAGED TO GIVE SUCH A CLEVER TURN TO THE AFFAIR THAT AN OLD LADY THOUGH SHE HAD THE RIGHT ON HER SIDE WOULD HAVE TO PAY A LARGE SUM TO HER OPPONENT
A WEEK AGO HE HAD WRITTEN HER A DECISIVE LETTER IN WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS GUILT AND HIS READINESS TO ATONE FOR IT
WHO STOOD WASHING OR IRONING WITH THEIR THIN ARMS IN THE FEARFULLY HOT FRONT ROOM
AND THE SHOPMAN AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD INJURED HER
PASSED HITHER AND THITHER PLAINTIFFS AND THOSE OF THE ACCUSED WHO WERE NOT GUARDED WANDERED SADLY ALONG THE WALLS OR SAT WAITING WHERE IS THE LAW COURT NEKHLUDOFF ASKED OF AN ATTENDANT
INFECTED KATUSHA AND HER BABY BOY HAD TO BE SENT TO THE FOUNDLINGS HOSPITAL
SHE WAS EXACTING SHE PUNISHED AND WHEN IN A BAD TEMPER EVEN STRUCK THE LITTLE GIRL GROWING UP UNDER THESE TWO DIFFERENT INFLUENCES THE GIRL TURNED OUT HALF SERVANT HALF YOUNG LADY
THE ADVOCATE IS A GENIUS HE SAID THE LISTENERS HEARD IT ALL WITH RESPECTFUL ATTENTION AND SEVERAL OF THEM TRIED TO PUT IN A WORD BUT THE MAN INTERRUPTED THEM AS IF HE ALONE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
EVEN THE ISVOSTCHIKS KNOW OF MY RELATIONS WITH THE KORCHAGINS THOUGHT NEKHLUDOFF AND AGAIN THE QUESTION WHETHER HE SHOULD NOT MARRY PRINCESS KORCHAGIN PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM AND HE COULD NOT DECIDE IT EITHER WAY
THEY CALLED HER KATUSHA WHICH SOUNDS LESS REFINED THAN KATINKA BUT IS NOT QUITE SO COMMON AS KATKA SHE USED TO SEW TIDY UP THE ROOMS
TRADESPEOPLE COOKS
THE UNPRINCIPLED WIFE OF THE MARECHAL DE NOBLESSE OF A DISTRICT WHERE NEKHLUDOFF WAS PRESENT AT AN ELECTION THE DESIRE OF VANQUISHING HIM THIS WOMAN DREW HIM INTO AN INTIMACY WHICH ENTANGLED HIM MORE AND MORE
STILL SPRING WAS SPRING EVEN IN THE TOWN THE SUN SHONE WARM THE AIR WAS BALMY
OF COURSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE SHOULD MEET HIM BUT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS CAPABLE OF LOVING ANOTHER OFFENDED HIM SO THAT HE HAD AS MANY REASONS FOR MARRYING AS AGAINST IT AT ANY RATE THEY WEIGHED EQUALLY WITH NEKHLUDOFF
I SHALL CONSIDER ALL THAT LATER ON HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS THE TRAP DROVE SILENTLY ALONG THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT UP TO THE DOORS OF THE COURT NOW I MUST FULFIL MY PUBLIC DUTIES CONSCIENTIOUSLY AS I AM IN THE HABIT OF ALWAYS DOING
HE COULD NOT PROPOSE AT ONCE IT WAS NOT THAT TEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BETRAYED AND FORSAKEN MASLOVA HE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THAT AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED IT A REASON FOR NOT MARRYING NO THE REASON WAS
NEKHLUDOFF GAVE HIS NAME AND PASSED INTO THE JURYMEN'S ROOM INSIDE THE ROOM WERE ABOUT TEN PERSONS OF ALL SORTS THEY HAD COME BUT A SHORT WHILE AGO AND SOME WERE SITTING OTHERS WALKING UP AND DOWN
AND HAD LOOKED DOWN WITH SOME DISDAIN AT ALL OTHER ACTIVITY FROM THE HEIGHT OF HIS ARTISTIC STANDPOINT AND NOW IT TURNED OUT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT REMINDED HIM OF ALL THIS WAS UNPLEASANT
THE LITTLE BLACK EYED MAIDEN GREW TO BE EXTREMELY PRETTY AND SO FULL OF SPIRITS THAT THE LADIES FOUND HER VERY ENTERTAINING THE YOUNGER OF THE LADIES SOPHIA IVANOVNA
CALLED OUT MASLOVA TO THE COURT AND CLOSED THE DOOR AGAIN EVEN INTO THE PRISON YARD THE BREEZE HAD BROUGHT THE FRESH VIVIFYING AIR FROM THE FIELDS
PUPILS AT A PUBLIC DAY SCHOOL
THE SHOPMAN WHO PROMISED TO MARRY HER
AND MASLOVA STEPPED OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CORRIDOR
AND ENTERED THE OFFICE WHERE TWO SOLDIERS WERE WAITING TO ESCORT HER
TRIMMED WITH BLACK VELVET WITH LOW NECK AND SHORT SLEEVES CONQUERED HER
AND DO OTHER LIGHT WORK AND SOMETIMES SHE SAT AND READ TO THE LADIES THOUGH SHE HAD MORE THAN ONE OFFER SHE WOULD NOT MARRY SHE FELT THAT LIFE AS THE WIFE OF ANY OF THE WORKING MEN WHO WERE COURTING HER
THE ATTENDANTS HURRIED OUT OF BREATH DRAGGING THEIR FEET ALONG THE GROUND WITHOUT LIFTING THEM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH ALL SORTS OF MESSAGES AND PAPERS
AND AFTER GIVING HER A ONE HUNDRED ROUBLE NOTE WENT AWAY FIVE MONTHS LATER
WHILE IT DAILY BECAME MORE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM HAVING SUCCUMBED TO THE TEMPTATION NEKHLUDOFF FELT GUILTY AND HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO BREAK THE TIE WITHOUT HER CONSENT
THAT HAD BEGUN TO GET THIN ABOVE THE FOREHEAD EVERYTHING HE USED EVERYTHING BELONGING TO HIS TOILET HIS LINEN HIS CLOTHES BOOTS NECKTIE PIN
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE
AND DROVE HER TO THE NOTORIOUS HOUSE KEPT BY CAROLINA ALBERTOVNA KITAEVA FROM THAT DAY A LIFE OF CHRONIC SIN AGAINST HUMAN AND DIVINE LAWS COMMENCED FOR KATUSHA MASLOVA
HE RESOLUTELY RAISED HIS SOLID FRAME AND PUTTING DOWN HIS SMOOTH WHITE LEGS STEPPED INTO HIS SLIPPERS THREW HIS SILK DRESSING GOWN OVER HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND PASSED INTO HIS DRESSING ROOM WALKING HEAVILY AND QUICKLY
THEREFORE EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD HIM THIS UNDERSTANDING OF HIM
AND WAS HURT IF HE DID NOT GET IT IN THE JURYMEN'S ROOM HIS FEELINGS WERE HURT BY DISRESPECTFUL TREATMENT AMONG THE JURY THERE HAPPENED TO BE A MAN WHOM HE KNEW A FORMER TEACHER OF HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN PETER GERASIMOVITCH
IN RUSSIAN AS IN MANY OTHER LANGUAGES THOU IS USED GENERALLY AMONG PEOPLE VERY FAMILIAR WITH EACH OTHER OR BY SUPERIORS TO INFERIORS
MANNER OF SPEAKING WALKING LAUGHING FROM THE COMMON PEOPLE NOT BY ANYTHING EXCEPTIONAL BUT BY HER GOOD BREEDING HE COULD FIND NO OTHER TERM FOR THIS QUALITY THOUGH HE PRIZED IT VERY HIGHLY
AND MANAGED TO SUPPORT HERSELF HER CHILDREN AND HER WRETCHED HUSBAND
HE FOUND THE SUMMONS AT ONCE IN A PIGEON HOLE LABELLED IMMEDIATE OF HIS LARGE WRITING TABLE HE HAD TO APPEAR AT THE COURT AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK NEKHLUDOFF SAT DOWN TO WRITE A NOTE IN REPLY TO THE PRINCESS
TWENTY FIVE WENT TO GET THE BABY INTO THE FOUNDLINGS HOSPITAL AND FORTY THE MIDWIFE BORROWED TO BUY A COW WITH
DUE ON THE FIRST THIS MONEY WOULD BE SENT ON BY THE NEXT MAIL
THIS NOTE WAS A CONTINUATION OF THAT SKILFUL MANOEUVRING WHICH THE PRINCESS KORCHAGIN HAD ALREADY PRACTISED FOR TWO MONTHS IN ORDER TO BIND HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER WITH INVISIBLE THREADS AND YET
SOPHIA IVANOVNA DRESSED THE LITTLE GIRL IN NICE CLOTHES AND TAUGHT HER TO READ AND WRITE MEANING TO EDUCATE HER LIKE A LADY
A WEALTHY AND ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY WHOSE DAUGHTER EVERY ONE EXPECTED HE WOULD MARRY HE SIGHED AND THROWING AWAY THE END OF HIS CIGARETTE WAS GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER OUT OF THE SILVER CASE BUT CHANGING HIS MIND
AFTER NEKHLUDOFF HAD ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY NAME IS BAKLASHEFF MERCHANT OF THE SECOND GUILD HE SAID PUTTING OUT HIS BROAD SOFT FLEXIBLE HAND WITH WHOM HAVE I THE HONOUR
FOR HER OWN GOOD AS HE EXPRESSED IT TO THIS LETTER HE HAD AS YET RECEIVED NO ANSWER THIS MIGHT PROVE A GOOD SIGN
VELVET SILK SATIN LOW NECKED BALL DRESSES ANYTHING SHE LIKED
AT THE IMPORTANT DEBATES CONCERNING THE SCHOOLS AND THE ROADS AS A STRONG OPPOSITION BY THE REACTIONARY PARTY WAS EXPECTED THE MARECHAL WAS A LIBERAL AND WAS QUITE ENGROSSED IN THIS FIGHT
WHERE A FEW STUDIES HUNG ON THE WALLS AND FACING THE EASEL STOOD AN UNFINISHED PICTURE A FEELING OF INABILITY TO ADVANCE IN ART A SENSE OF HIS INCAPACITY CAME OVER HIM HE HAD OFTEN HAD THIS FEELING OF LATE
EVERYTHING SEEMED REPUGNANT TO HER
KATUSHA HAD TO LOOK OUT FOR A PLACE AGAIN
HANDING HIM THE LETTER WITH A SIGNIFICANT SMILE ALL RIGHT DIRECTLY SAID NEKHLUDOFF TAKING THE LETTER AND FROWNING AS HE NOTICED AGRAPHENA PETROVNA'S SMILE THAT SMILE MEANT THAT THE LETTER WAS FROM THE YOUNGER PRINCESS KORCHAGIN
THE EARLY SPRING AND THE BUSINESS BEFORE THEM SOME HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED OTHERS JUST GUESSING WHO WAS WHO THOSE WHO WERE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH NEKHLUDOFF MADE HASTE TO GET INTRODUCED EVIDENTLY LOOKING UPON THIS AS AN HONOUR
ENTERED THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN AT ONCE NEAR KATUSHA SMILING AND GAZING AT HER WITH GLISTENING EYES HE BEGAN JOKING WITH HER THE HOSTESS CALLED HIM AWAY INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND KATUSHA HEARD HER SAY A FRESH ONE FROM THE COUNTRY
A TABLE WHICH LOOKED VERY IMPOSING WITH ITS FOUR LEGS CARVED IN THE SHAPE OF LIONS PAWS AND A HUGE SIDE BOARD TO MATCH STOOD IN THE OBLONG ROOM THE FLOOR OF WHICH HAD BEEN POLISHED BY THREE MEN THE DAY BEFORE ON THE TABLE
THE OLD LADIES SPOKE OF HER AS THE SAVED ONE WHEN THE CHILD WAS THREE YEARS OLD HER MOTHER FELL ILL AND DIED
BOUGHT FROM THE MOST EXPENSIVE DEALERS IN THESE GOODS HE QUITE KNEW WOULD NOT SERVE AS A REASON FOR CLAIMING SUPERIORITY AT THE SAME TIME HE DID CLAIM SUPERIORITY AND ACCEPTED THE RESPECT PAID HIM AS HIS DUE
THE MARECHAL'S WIFE AND FINISH COMPLETELY WITH HER I CAN DO NOTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND THE CONVICTION THAT HE MIGHT AND WAS EVEN OBLIGED TO DELAY HIS DECISION WAS COMFORTING WELL
THE OLD MAIDEN LADY SCOLDED THE MAIDS AGAIN
A MAN AND TWO WOMEN ONE OF THESE WOMEN AS THE CHIEF CRIMINAL TO BE CONDUCTED SEPARATELY
THE FACT OF HIS SPEAKING ENGLISH FRENCH AND GERMAN WITH A GOOD ACCENT
AND THERE MET A WOMAN WITH BRACELETS ON HER BARE PLUMP ARMS AND RINGS ON MOST OF HER FINGERS HEARING THAT KATUSHA WAS BADLY IN WANT OF A PLACE THE WOMAN GAVE HER HER ADDRESS AND INVITED HER TO COME TO HER HOUSE KATUSHA WENT
NEKHLUDOFF FLUSHED AND FELT HIS ENERGIES AWAKENING AS THEY ALWAYS DID WHEN HE WAS FACING ANY KIND OF DANGER BUT HIS EXCITEMENT PASSED AT ONCE THE MARECHAL DO NOBLESSE OF THE DISTRICT IN WHICH HIS LARGEST ESTATE LAY
THAT HE HAD A LIAISON WITH A MARRIED WOMAN AND THOUGH HE CONSIDERED IT BROKEN OFF SHE DID NOT NEKHLUDOFF WAS RATHER SHY WITH WOMEN AND HIS VERY SHYNESS AWAKENED IN THIS MARRIED WOMAN
NEKHLUDOFF HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOME OFFICER WHO WAS PAYING HER MARKED ATTENTION AND THIS TORMENTED HIM BY AWAKENING JEALOUSY AND AT THE SAME TIME ENCOURAGED HIM WITH THE HOPE OF ESCAPE FROM THE DECEPTION THAT WAS OPPRESSING HIM
AGAINST MARRIAGE IN GENERAL WAS THE FEAR COMMON TO BACHELORS PAST THEIR FIRST YOUTH OF LOSING FREEDOM AND AN UNCONSCIOUS AWE BEFORE THIS MYSTERIOUS CREATURE A WOMAN
THANKING HER FOR THE INVITATION AND PROMISING TO TRY AND COME TO DINNER HAVING WRITTEN ONE NOTE HE TORE IT UP AS IT SEEMED TOO INTIMATE HE WROTE ANOTHER BUT IT WAS TOO COLD HE FEARED IT MIGHT GIVE OFFENCE SO HE TORE IT UP TOO
BUT SEEING WHAT A LIFE OF MISERY AND HARDSHIP HER AUNT'S ASSISTANTS LED KATUSHA HESITATED AND APPLIED TO A REGISTRY OFFICE
THAT JUSTICE FORBIDS PRIVATE LANDHOLDING AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD RESOLUTENESS OF HIS AGE HAD NOT MERELY SPOKEN TO PROVE THAT LAND COULD NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND WRITTEN ESSAYS ON THAT SUBJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY
WAS NEGLECTED BY ITS MOTHER WHOM IT HINDERED AT HER WORK
CONDUCT UNLIKE OURS LEADS TO THE CHILDREN STOPPED AND GAZED AT THE ROBBER WITH FRIGHTENED LOOKS BUT THE THOUGHT THAT THE SOLDIERS WERE PREVENTING HER FROM DOING MORE HARM QUIETED THEIR FEARS
THOUGH NEKHLUDOFF HAD ARRIVED LATE HE HAD TO WAIT A LONG TIME
WHO HAD STOOD GODMOTHER TO THE GIRL HAD THE KINDER HEART OF THE TWO SISTERS
TO HARMONY AND TO LOVE BUT ONLY THEIR OWN DEVICES FOR ENSLAVING ONE ANOTHER THUS IN THE PRISON OFFICE OF THE GOVERNMENT TOWN
REEKING OF TOBACCO AND POINTING TO THE PRISONER REMARKED TAKE HER THE SOLDIER
THE TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES SOON WENT SOME SHE PAID TO HER AUNT FOR BOARD AND LODGING THE REST WAS SPENT ON A HAT RIBBONS AND SUCH LIKE A FEW DAYS LATER THE AUTHOR SENT FOR HER AND SHE WENT
WHEN I MEET AN ENEMY I RUN TO MY HOLE AND JUMP IN AND THERE I STAY UNTIL ALL DANGER IS OVER YOU HAVE TOLD ME WHAT YOU SEE IN SUMMER CONTINUED DOROTHY WHO WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE RABBIT'S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF
AND AID THEM WHEN AND WHERE THEY WOULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A REVIVING PLEASURE IN THIS INTERCOURSE OF A KIND NOW TASTED BY ME FOR THE FIRST TIME
HE EXPRESSED ONCE AND BUT ONCE IN MY HEARING A STRONG SENSE OF THE RUGGED CHARM OF THE HILLS AND AN INBORN AFFECTION FOR THE DARK ROOF AND HOARY WALLS HE CALLED HIS HOME
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE STY THERE WAS NO PIG TO BE SEEN AND HE SEARCHED ALL ROUND THE PLACE FOR A GOOD HOUR WITHOUT FINDING IT
TOM THE PIPER'S SON
THIS GREW TO FORCE COMPRESSED CONDENSED CONTROLLED THE HEART WAS THRILLED THE MIND ASTONISHED BY THE POWER OF THE PREACHER NEITHER WERE SOFTENED THROUGHOUT THERE WAS A STRANGE BITTERNESS AN ABSENCE OF CONSOLATORY GENTLENESS
I LIVE IN THE GROUND FAR DOWN IN A COOL PLEASANT HOLE I HAVE DUG IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE IS THE NICEST LITTLE ROOM YOU CAN IMAGINE AND THERE I HAVE MADE A SOFT BED TO REST IN AT NIGHT
AND EVERY YEAR THERE IS SOMETHING NEW AMONGST THEM ONCE I VISITED SANTA AND SAW HIM MAKE THE TOYS
AND THEN THEY MUST HAVE TOYS TO AMUSE THEM AND KEEP THEM CONTENTED I KNEW THIS WAS TRUE SO I ONLY SAID ADMIRINGLY YOU MUST BE THE QUICKEST AND THE BEST WORKMAN IN ALL THE WORLD SANTA I SUPPOSE I AM HE ANSWERED
BUT NO TRACES OF THE PIG COULD HE FIND ANYWHERE AND THAT WAS NO GREAT WONDER FOR THE PIG WAS EATEN BY THAT TIME AND ITS BONES PICKED CLEAN FINALLY THE FARMER CAME TO THE END OF THE STREET WHERE THE PIPER LIVED IN HIS LITTLE HUT
DIANA OFFERED TO TEACH ME GERMAN I LIKED TO LEARN OF HER I SAW THE PART OF INSTRUCTRESS PLEASED AND SUITED HER THAT OF SCHOLAR PLEASED AND SUITED ME NO LESS
AND WHEN HE HAD LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY HE CRIED OUT THIS TAIL BELONGED TO MY LITTLE PIG FOR I KNOW VERY WELL THE CURL AT THE END OF IT TELL ME YOU RASCAL WHERE IS THE PIG THEN TOM FELL IN A TREMBLE FOR HE KNEW HIS WICKEDNESS WAS DISCOVERED
BUT THERE WAS MORE OF GLOOM THAN PLEASURE IN THE TONE AND WORDS IN WHICH THE SENTIMENT WAS MANIFESTED AND NEVER DID HE SEEM TO ROAM THE MOORS FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR SOOTHING SILENCE NEVER SEEK OUT OR DWELL UPON THE THOUSAND PEACEFUL DELIGHTS THEY COULD YIELD
SHE WAS HANDSOME SHE WAS VIGOROUS IN HER ANIMAL SPIRITS THERE WAS AN AFFLUENCE OF LIFE AND CERTAINTY OF FLOW SUCH AS EXCITED MY WONDER WHILE IT BAFFLED MY COMPREHENSION I COULD TALK A WHILE WHEN THE EVENING COMMENCED
ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT HE HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN FOR ME YET IT BECAME URGENT THAT I SHOULD HAVE A VOCATION OF SOME KIND ONE MORNING BEING LEFT ALONE WITH HIM A FEW MINUTES IN THE PARLOUR I VENTURED TO APPROACH THE WINDOW RECESS
AFTER THIS SAID SANTA CLAUS I CAN MAKE RABBITS WITHOUT HAVING YOU FOR A PATTERN BUT IF YOU LIKE YOU MAY STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER IN MY CASTLE AND AMUSE YOURSELF I THANKED HIM AND DECIDED TO STAY
AND DID NOT LIKE TO CRUSH THE PRETTY FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN HER PATH AND SHE WAS ALSO VERY FOND OF ALL THE ANIMALS AND LEARNED TO KNOW THEM WELL AND EVEN TO UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN DO AND THE ANIMALS LOVED DOROTHY IN TURN
THEY CLUNG TO THE PURPLE MOORS BEHIND AND AROUND THEIR DWELLING TO THE HOLLOW VALE INTO WHICH THE PEBBLY BRIDLE PATH LEADING FROM THEIR GATE DESCENDED AND WHICH WOUND BETWEEN FERN BANKS FIRST AND THEN AMONGST A FEW OF THE WILDEST LITTLE PASTURE FIELDS
MARY WOULD SIT AND WATCH ME BY THE HOUR TOGETHER THEN SHE WOULD TAKE LESSONS AND A DOCILE INTELLIGENT ASSIDUOUS PUPIL SHE MADE THUS OCCUPIED AND MUTUALLY ENTERTAINED DAYS PASSED LIKE HOURS AND WEEKS LIKE DAYS
BUT HE WAS SO SLY AND CAUTIOUS THAT NO ONE HAD EVER CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT OF STEALING ALTHOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS HAD BEEN MISSED AFTER THEY HAD FALLEN INTO THE OLD MAN'S WAY BARNEY HAD ONE SON NAMED TOM
IN A FEW DAYS I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED MY HEALTH THAT I COULD SIT UP ALL DAY AND WALK OUT SOMETIMES I COULD JOIN WITH DIANA AND MARY IN ALL THEIR OCCUPATIONS CONVERSE WITH THEM AS MUCH AS THEY WISHED
SO TOM TOOK HIS FATHER'S PIPES AND WALKED OVER THE HILL TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON LEARNED TO PLAY WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
IT WAS DARK BEFORE HE CAME BACK TO HIS HOME AND HIS FATHER WAS STILL ASLEEP SO TOM CREPT INTO THE HUT AND WENT TO BED BUT HE HAD RECEIVED A GOOD LESSON AND NEVER AFTER THAT COULD THE OLD PIPER INDUCE HIM TO STEAL
INCOMMUNICATIVE AS HE WAS SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF GAUGING HIS MIND
STERN ALLUSIONS TO CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ELECTION PREDESTINATION REPROBATION WERE FREQUENT AND EACH REFERENCE TO THESE POINTS SOUNDED LIKE A SENTENCE PRONOUNCED FOR DOOM
NO WEATHER SEEMED TO HINDER HIM IN THESE PASTORAL EXCURSIONS RAIN OR FAIR HE WOULD WHEN HIS HOURS OF MORNING STUDY WERE OVER TAKE HIS HAT AND FOLLOWED BY HIS FATHER'S OLD POINTER CARLO GO OUT ON HIS MISSION OF LOVE OR DUTY
FOR THE WORD PASSED AROUND AMONGST THEM THAT SHE COULD BE TRUSTED TO DO THEM NO HARM FOR THE HORSE WHOSE SOFT NOSE DOROTHY OFTEN GENTLY STROKED TOLD THE COW OF HER KINDNESS AND THE COW TOLD THE DOG AND THE DOG TOLD THE CAT
AND I SAW A GOOD MANY STRANGE SIGHTS BEFORE I GOT BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN BUT WHAT BECAME OF THE MAGIC COLLAR ASKED DOROTHY WHO HAD LISTENED WITH BREATHLESS INTEREST TO THE RABBIT'S STORY
AND THEN SHE ROMPED AWAY TO THE FIELDS TO AMUSE HERSELF IN HER OWN WAY SHE CAME TO KNOW EVERY FLOWER THAT GREW AND TO CALL THEM BY NAME AND SHE ALWAYS STEPPED VERY CAREFULLY TO AVOID TREADING ON THEM FOR DOROTHY WAS A KIND HEARTED CHILD
I WAITED A FEW MOMENTS EXPECTING HE WOULD GO ON WITH THE SUBJECT FIRST BROACHED BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE ENTERED ANOTHER TRAIN OF REFLECTION HIS LOOK DENOTED ABSTRACTION FROM ME AND MY BUSINESS
AND SANTA CLAUS WHEN HE SEES ME ALWAYS GIVES ME A NOD AND A SMILE AND THEN I LOOK AFTER HIM AND HIS BIG LOAD OF TOYS WHICH HE IS CARRYING TO THE CHILDREN UNTIL HE HAS GALLOPED AWAY OUT OF SIGHT I LIKE TO SEE THE TOYS FOR THEY ARE SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY
THE ROOMS ARE BIG AND HIGH AND THERE IS A SOFT CARPET UPON EVERY FLOOR AND MANY STRANGE THINGS SCATTERED AROUND TO AMUSE ONE SANTA CLAUS LIVES THERE ALL ALONE EXCEPT FOR OLD MOTHER HUBBARD WHO COOKS THE MEALS FOR HIM
THAN WHEN HE STOLE THE PIG TO GET A DINNER AND SUFFERED A SEVERE BEATING AS A PUNISHMENT
UNTIL THE RABBIT BECAME REASSURED AND BLINKED HIS BIG EYES AT HER THOUGHTFULLY FOR HE WAS AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE LITTLE GIRL AS SHE IN HIM SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DARED TO MEET A PERSON FACE TO FACE
AS GOVERNESSES IN A LARGE FASHIONABLE SOUTH OF ENGLAND CITY WHERE EACH HELD A SITUATION IN FAMILIES
AND AT FIRST I DID N'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS THE LIVE RABBIT OR THE TOY RABBIT WE WERE SO MUCH ALIKE
THAT EVER BORDERED A WILDERNESS OF HEATH OR GAVE SUSTENANCE TO A FLOCK OF GREY MOORLAND SHEEP WITH THEIR LITTLE MOSSY FACED LAMBS THEY CLUNG TO THIS SCENE I SAY WITH A PERFECT ENTHUSIASM OF ATTACHMENT
AND APPRECIATED ONLY THEIR ACQUIRED ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS THEY APPRECIATED THE SKILL OF THEIR COOK OR THE TASTE OF THEIR WAITING WOMAN
THE LITTLE ONES WILL BE DELIGHTED THEN HE LIT A BIG PIPE AND BEGAN TO SMOKE AND SOON HE TOOK A ROLL OF SOFT FUR FROM A SHELF IN A CORNER AND COMMENCED TO CUT IT OUT IN THE SHAPE OF A RABBIT HE SMOKED AND WHISTLED ALL THE TIME HE WAS WORKING
THE PIG WAS EAT AND TOM WAS BEAT AND TOM RAN CRYING DOWN THE STREET
THE PIPER AND HIS SON HAD A FINE DINNER THAT DAY AND SO GREAT WAS THEIR HUNGER THAT THE LITTLE PIG WAS ALL EATEN UP AT ONE MEAL THEN BARNEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP AND TOM SAT ON A BENCH OUTSIDE THE DOOR
BUT THAT IT WAS PERTURBED AND EXCITING MIGHT BE SEEN IN THE FREQUENT FLASH AND CHANGEFUL DILATION OF HIS EYE I THINK MOREOVER THAT NATURE WAS NOT TO HIM
THE PIG IS EAT YOUR HONOR HE ANSWERED THE FARMER SAID NEVER A WORD BUT HIS FACE GREW BLACK WITH ANGER AND UNBUCKLING THE STRAP THAT WAS ABOUT HIS WAIST HE WAVED IT AROUND HIS HEAD AND WHACK
I SCARCELY KNOW IN WHICH LIGHT HE REGARDED IT SOMETIMES WHEN THE DAY WAS VERY UNFAVOURABLE HIS SISTERS WOULD EXPOSTULATE HE WOULD THEN SAY WITH A PECULIAR SMILE MORE SOLEMN THAN CHEERFUL
REGRETS TO WHICH I HAVE LATTERLY AVOIDED REFERRING BUT WHICH POSSESSED ME AND TYRANNISED OVER ME RUTHLESSLY MEANTIME A MONTH WAS GONE
FOR IT WAS ONE OF THE LOVELIEST PLACES YOU COULD IMAGINE IT STOOD ON THE TOP OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN AND IS BUILT OF GOLD AND SILVER BRICKS AND THE WINDOWS ARE PURE DIAMOND CRYSTALS
ITS AVENUE OF AGED FIRS ALL GROWN ASLANT UNDER THE STRESS OF MOUNTAIN WINDS ITS GARDEN DARK WITH YEW AND HOLLY AND WHERE NO FLOWERS BUT OF THE HARDIEST SPECIES WOULD BLOOM FOUND A CHARM BOTH POTENT AND PERMANENT
UNDER HIS FATHER'S GUIDANCE HE FELL INTO BAD WAYS ONE MORNING TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON WAS HUNGRY WHEN THE DAY BEGUN HE WANTED A BUN AND ASKED FOR ONE BUT SOON FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE NONE
ONE OF CLOSE AND ANXIOUS INTEREST TO ME WHAT IS THE EMPLOYMENT YOU HAD IN VIEW MISTER RIVERS I HOPE THIS DELAY WILL NOT HAVE INCREASED THE DIFFICULTY OF SECURING IT
AND HE PLAYED THIS ONE TUNE AS BADLY AS HIS FATHER HIMSELF PLAYED SO THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ANNOYED WHEN THEY HEARD HIM AND OFTEN BEGGED HIM TO STOP WHEN HE CAME TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE TOM STARTED UP THE PIPES
ZEALOUS AS HE WAS HAD NOT YET FOUND THAT PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING HE HAD NO MORE FOUND IT I THOUGHT THAN HAD I WITH MY CONCEALED AND RACKING REGRETS FOR MY BROKEN IDOL AND LOST ELYSIUM
A GOOD BEATING AND TOM WAS SO SCARED THAT HE NEVER STOPPED RUNNING UNTIL HE CAME TO THE END OF THE VILLAGE AND HE BAWLED LUSTILY THE WHOLE WAY AND CRIED OUT AT EVERY STEP
FEARING AT FIRST THE NEW RABBIT WAS ALIVE OLD SANTA LAUGHED MERRILY AT THIS AND I SOON RECOVERED FROM MY FRIGHT AND WAS PLEASED TO THINK THE BABIES WERE TO HAVE SUCH PRETTY PLAYTHINGS
I DO N'T DOUBT IT YOUR HONOR I ANSWERED BUT THEY D SOON KILL ME WITH HANDLING EVEN IF THEY DID NOT SCARE ME TO DEATH FOR BABIES ARE VERY ROUGH WITH THEIR PLAYTHINGS THAT IS TRUE REPLIED SANTA CLAUS AND YET YOU ARE SO SOFT AND PRETTY
ZEALOUS IN HIS MINISTERIAL LABOURS BLAMELESS IN HIS LIFE AND HABITS HE YET DID NOT APPEAR TO ENJOY THAT MENTAL SERENITY THAT INWARD CONTENT WHICH SHOULD BE THE REWARD OF EVERY SINCERE CHRISTIAN AND PRACTICAL PHILANTHROPIST
AND SOME MINUTES OF APPARENTLY MOURNFUL MEDITATION BUT BESIDES HIS FREQUENT ABSENCES THERE WAS ANOTHER BARRIER TO FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM HE SEEMED OF A RESERVED AN ABSTRACTED AND EVEN OF A BROODING NATURE
AFTER MOTHER HUBBARD HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD DINNER AND I HAD EATEN SOME OF THE MOST DELICIOUS CLOVER I HAVE EVER TASTED SANTA TOOK ME UP INTO HIS WORK ROOM AND SAT ME UPON THE TABLE IF I CAN ONLY MAKE RABBITS HALF AS NICE AS YOU ARE HE SAID
AH YOU CAN RUN ABOUT ALL DAY IN SUMMER AND IN WINTER AND ENJOY YOURSELF IN YOUR OWN WAY SAID SANTA BUT THE POOR LITTLE CHILDREN ARE OBLIGED TO STAY IN THE HOUSE IN THE WINTER AND ON RAINY DAYS IN THE SUMMER
WHAT SHALL WE DO HE ASKED HIS FATHER GO HUNGRY REPLIED BARNEY UNLESS YOU WANT TO TAKE MY PIPES AND PLAY IN THE VILLAGE
AND SO HE SNIPPED A LITTLE OFF THE FUR HE WAS CUTTING
SO HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND BUCKLED A STRAP AROUND HIS WAIST AND WENT DOWN TO THE VILLAGE TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND OUT WHO HAD STOLEN HIS PIG UP AND DOWN THE STREET HE WENT AND IN AND OUT THE LANES
AND BEGAN TO PLAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE FARMER WAS IN HIS WOODSHED SAWING WOOD SO HE DID NOT HEAR THE PIPES AND THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS DEAF AND COULD NOT HEAR THEM
YOU SEE WE HAVE ONLY OUR EYES AND OUR EARS AND OUR LEGS TO DEFEND OURSELVES WITH WE CANNOT FIGHT BUT WE CAN ALWAYS RUN AWAY AND THAT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO SAVE OUR LIVES THAN BY FIGHTING WHERE IS YOUR HOME BUNNY ENQUIRED THE GIRL
HAD SPRUNG FROM A DEPTH WHERE LAY TURBID DREGS OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHERE MOVED TROUBLING IMPULSES OF INSATIATE YEARNINGS AND DISQUIETING ASPIRATIONS
WHEN I HEARD HIM PREACH IN HIS OWN CHURCH AT MORTON I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE THAT SERMON BUT IT IS PAST MY POWER I CANNOT EVEN RENDER FAITHFULLY THE EFFECT IT PRODUCED ON ME
LOOKED OUT OF A SMALL BUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE WOOD ONE DAY AND SAW DOROTHY STANDING A LITTLE WAY OFF HE DID NOT SCAMPER AWAY AS IS HIS CUSTOM BUT SAT VERY STILL AND MET THE GAZE OF HER SWEET EYES BOLDLY
OFTEN OF AN EVENING WHEN HE SAT AT THE WINDOW HIS DESK AND PAPERS BEFORE HIM HE WOULD CEASE READING OR WRITING REST HIS CHIN ON HIS HAND AND DELIVER HIMSELF UP TO I KNOW NOT WHAT COURSE OF THOUGHT
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE PIPER HAD THE PIG KILLED AND CUT INTO PIECES AND BOILING IN THE POT ONLY THE TAIL WAS LEFT OUT FOR TOM WANTED TO MAKE A WHISTLE OF IT AND AS THERE WAS PLENTY TO EAT BESIDES THE TAIL HIS FATHER LET HIM HAVE IT
STILL AS THEY WOULD ABUSE A LIVE RABBIT I THINK I SHALL MAKE THEM SOME TOY RABBITS WHICH THEY CANNOT HURT SO IF YOU WILL JUMP INTO MY SLEIGH WITH ME AND RIDE HOME TO MY CASTLE FOR A FEW DAYS I LL SEE IF I CAN'T MAKE SOME TOY RABBITS JUST LIKE YOU
ON THE WILD COLOURING COMMUNICATED TO RIDGE AND DELL BY MOSS BY HEATH BELL BY FLOWER SPRINKLED TURF BY BRILLIANT BRACKEN AND MELLOW GRANITE CRAG THESE DETAILS WERE JUST TO ME WHAT THEY WERE TO THEM
OUR NATURES DOVETAILED MUTUAL AFFECTION OF THE STRONGEST KIND WAS THE RESULT THEY DISCOVERED I COULD DRAW THEIR PENCILS AND COLOUR BOXES WERE IMMEDIATELY AT MY SERVICE MY SKILL GREATER IN THIS ONE POINT THAN THEIRS SURPRISED AND CHARMED THEM
THE NEXT CHRISTMAS WHEN I WATCHED BY THE ROAD SIDE TO SEE SANTA I WAS PLEASED TO NOTICE A GREAT MANY OF THE TOY RABBITS STICKING OUT OF THE LOADED SLEIGH THE BABIES MUST HAVE LIKED THEM TOO FOR EVERY YEAR SINCE I HAVE SEEN THEM AMONGST THE TOYS
YOU HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK OF ME HE SAID YES I WISH TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE HEARD OF ANY SERVICE I CAN OFFER MYSELF TO UNDERTAKE I FOUND OR DEVISED SOMETHING FOR YOU THREE WEEKS AGO BUT AS YOU SEEMED BOTH USEFUL AND HAPPY HERE
NO ANSWERED TOM SHAKING HIS HEAD NO ONE WILL GIVE ME A PENNY FOR PLAYING
WHAT I HAD PERUSED DURING THE DAY THOUGHT FITTED THOUGHT OPINION MET OPINION WE COINCIDED IN SHORT PERFECTLY IF IN OUR TRIO THERE WAS A SUPERIOR AND A LEADER IT WAS DIANA PHYSICALLY SHE FAR EXCELLED ME
OH NO SINCE IT IS AN EMPLOYMENT WHICH DEPENDS ONLY ON ME TO GIVE AND YOU TO ACCEPT
AND HER CUPBOARD IS NEVER BARE NOW I CAN PROMISE YOU AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE THERE IS ONE BIG ROOM AND THAT IS SANTA'S WORK SHOP WHERE HE MAKES THE TOYS ON ONE SIDE IS HIS WORK BENCH WITH PLENTY OF SAWS AND HAMMERS AND JACK KNIVES
SANTA NEVER FORGETS ME AND EVERY TIME HE PASSES HE CALLS OUT IN HIS JOLLY VOICE A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU BUN RABBIT THE BABIES STILL LOVE YOU DEARLY THE RABBIT PAUSED AND DOROTHY WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION
AND THEY WILL GO IN THREE DAYS NOW I SAID YES AND WHEN THEY GO I SHALL RETURN TO THE PARSONAGE AT MORTON HANNAH WILL ACCOMPANY ME AND THIS OLD HOUSE WILL BE SHUT UP
AND IF I LET A GUST OF WIND OR A SPRINKLING OF RAIN TURN ME ASIDE FROM THESE EASY TASKS WHAT PREPARATION WOULD SUCH SLOTH BE FOR THE FUTURE I PROPOSE TO MYSELF DIANA AND MARY'S GENERAL ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WAS A SIGH
SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS I WATCHED HIM MAKING ALL KINDS OF TOYS AND I WONDERED TO SEE HOW QUICKLY HE MADE THEM AND HOW MANY NEW THINGS HE INVENTED I ALMOST WISH I WAS A CHILD I SAID TO HIM ONE DAY FOR THEN I TOO COULD HAVE PLAYTHINGS
WHEN TOM SHOWED BY HIS ACTIONS HIS INTENTION OF BEING HONEST HE SOON GOT A JOB OF WORK TO DO AND BEFORE LONG HE WAS ABLE TO EARN A LIVING MORE EASILY AND A GREAT DEAL MORE HONESTLY
THE FARMER GAVE ME NOTHING BUT A SCOLDING BUT THERE WAS A VERY NICE PIG RUNNING AROUND THE YARD HOW BIG WAS IT ASKED BARNEY OH JUST ABOUT BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE A NICE DINNER FOR YOU AND ME
OH NO SAID I I PREFER TO RUN BY MYSELF FOR I CAN EASILY FIND THE WAY AND I WANT TO SEE THE COUNTRY IF THAT IS THE CASE REPLIED SANTA I MUST GIVE YOU A MAGIC COLLAR TO WEAR SO THAT YOU WILL COME TO NO HARM
I LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY ENJOYED DELIGHTED ME WHAT THEY APPROVED I REVERENCED THEY LOVED THEIR SEQUESTERED HOME I TOO IN THE GREY SMALL ANTIQUE STRUCTURE
AND IN A MINUTE TOM HAD THE PIG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM AND WAS RUNNING BACK HOME WITH IT THE PIPER WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE THE PIG AND SAID TO TOM YOU ARE A GOOD SON AND THE PIG IS VERY NICE AND FAT WE SHALL HAVE A DINNER FIT FOR A KING
FINALLY DOROTHY VENTURED TO SPEAK SO SHE ASKED VERY SOFTLY AND SLOWLY OH LITTLE BUN RABBIT SO SOFT AND SO SHY SAY WHAT DO YOU SEE WITH YOUR BIG ROUND EYE MANY THINGS ANSWERED THE RABBIT
AND HE TALKED TO ME IN SUCH A JOLLY WAY THAT I SAT PERFECTLY STILL AND ALLOWED HIM TO MEASURE MY EARS AND MY LEGS SO THAT HE COULD CUT THE FUR INTO THE PROPER FORM
BUT THEN YOU SEE I HAVE BEEN MAKING TOYS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND I MAKE SO MANY IT IS NO WONDER I AM SKILLFUL AND NOW IF YOU ARE READY TO GO HOME I LL HITCH UP THE REINDEER AND TAKE YOU BACK AGAIN
AND THEN HE STUFFED THE FUR FULL OF SAWDUST AND SEWED IT UP NEATLY AFTER WHICH HE PUT IN SOME GLASS EYES THAT MADE THE TOY RABBIT LOOK WONDERFULLY LIFE LIKE WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE HE PUT IT ON THE TABLE BESIDE ME
AND I SEE THE DOGS AND THE MEN LONG BEFORE THEY CAN SEE ME OR KNOW THAT I AM NEAR AND THEREFORE I AM ABLE TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY IS THAT THE REASON YOUR EYES ARE SO BIG ASKED DOROTHY I SUPPOSE SO RETURNED THE RABBIT
AND THEY LIVED ALL ALONE IN A LITTLE HUT AWAY AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE STREET FOR TOM'S MOTHER HAD DIED WHEN HE WAS A BABY YOU MAY NOT SUPPOSE THAT TOM WAS A VERY GOOD BOY SINCE HE HAD SUCH A QUEER FATHER BUT NEITHER WAS HE VERY BAD
SAY WHAT DO YOU SEE WITH YOUR BIG ROUND EYE ON CHRISTMAS WE RABBITS SAYS BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY LITTLE DOROTHY HAD PASSED ALL THE FEW YEARS OF HER LIFE IN THE COUNTRY
AND THERE HE SAW TOM SITTING ON A BENCH AND BLOWING ON A WHISTLE MADE FROM A PIG'S TAIL WHERE DID YOU GET THAT TAIL ASKED THE FARMER I FOUND IT SAID NAUGHTY TOM BEGINNING TO BE FRIGHTENED LET ME SEE IT DEMANDED THE FARMER
DID NOT EXTEND TO HIM ONE REASON OF THE DISTANCE YET OBSERVED BETWEEN US WAS THAT HE WAS COMPARATIVELY SELDOM AT HOME A LARGE PROPORTION OF HIS TIME APPEARED DEVOTED TO VISITING THE SICK AND POOR AMONG THE SCATTERED POPULATION OF HIS PARISH
IT BEGAN CALM AND INDEED AS FAR AS DELIVERY AND PITCH OF VOICE WENT IT WAS CALM TO THE END AN EARNESTLY FELT YET STRICTLY RESTRAINED ZEAL BREATHED SOON IN THE DISTINCT ACCENTS AND PROMPTED THE NERVOUS LANGUAGE
AND SO HE WENT SOFTLY UP TO THE PIG STY AND REACHED OVER AND GRABBED THE LITTLE PIG BY THE EARS THE PIG SQUEALED OF COURSE BUT THE FARMER WAS MAKING SO MUCH NOISE HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT HEAR IT
BUT THE FIRST GUSH OF VIVACITY AND FLUENCY GONE I WAS FAIN TO SIT ON A STOOL AT DIANA'S FEET TO REST MY HEAD ON HER KNEE AND LISTEN ALTERNATELY TO HER AND MARY WHILE THEY SOUNDED THOROUGHLY THE TOPIC ON WHICH I HAD BUT TOUCHED
AND AGAIN HE SAID GOOD GRACIOUS THE EARS ARE TOO SHORT ENTIRELY SO HE HAD TO GET A NEEDLE AND THREAD AND SEW ON MORE FUR TO THE EARS SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE THE RIGHT SIZE BUT AFTER A TIME IT WAS ALL FINISHED
AND BEING THE ONLY CHILD UPON THE FARM SHE WAS ALLOWED TO ROAM ABOUT THE MEADOWS AND WOODS AS SHE PLEASED ON THE BRIGHT SUMMER MORNINGS DOROTHY'S MOTHER WOULD TIE A SUN BONNET UNDER THE GIRL'S CHIN
CAME THE STRAP OVER TOM'S BACK OW OW CRIED THE BOY AND STARTED TO RUN DOWN THE STREET WHACK WHACK FELL THE STRAP OVER HIS SHOULDER FOR THE FARMER FOLLOWED AT HIS HEELS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET
THEY WERE BOTH MORE ACCOMPLISHED AND BETTER READ THAN I WAS BUT WITH EAGERNESS I FOLLOWED IN THE PATH OF KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD TRODDEN BEFORE ME I DEVOURED THE BOOKS THEY LENT ME THEN IT WAS FULL SATISFACTION TO DISCUSS WITH THEM IN THE EVENING
I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIM NOR OF HIS REINDEER AND IT IS SUCH FUN TO SEE HIM COME DASHING ALONG CRACKING HIS WHIP AND CALLING OUT CHEERILY TO HIS REINDEER WHO ARE ABLE TO RUN EVEN SWIFTER THAN WE RABBITS
WHEN HE SAVED ME THE TROUBLE BY BEING THE FIRST TO COMMENCE A DIALOGUE
OF COURSE I CONSENTED FOR WE ALL LIKE TO PLEASE OLD SANTA AND A MINUTE LATER I HAD JUMPED INTO THE SLEIGH BESIDE HIM AND WE WERE DASHING AWAY AT FULL SPEED TOWARD HIS CASTLE I ENJOYED THE RIDE VERY MUCH BUT I ENJOYED THE CASTLE FAR MORE
THE FARMER HAD STOPPED SAWING TO REST JUST THEN AND WHEN HE HEARD THE SINGING HE RUSHED OUT OF THE SHED AND CHASED TOM AWAY WITH A BIG STICK OF WOOD THE BOY WENT BACK TO HIS FATHER AND SAID SORROWFULLY FOR HE WAS MORE HUNGRY THAN BEFORE
IT WAS ONE MORNING AFTER CHRISTMAS SAID THE RABBIT WHO SEEMED TO ENJOY TALKING NOW THAT HE HAD OVERCOME HIS FEAR OF DOROTHY AND I WAS SITTING BY THE ROAD SIDE WHEN SANTA CLAUS CAME RIDING BACK IN HIS EMPTY SLEIGH HE DOES NOT COME HOME QUITE SO FAST AS HE GOES
AFTER I GOT HOME REPLIED THE RABBIT THE COLLAR DISAPPEARED FROM AROUND MY NECK AND I KNEW SANTA HAD CALLED IT BACK TO HIMSELF AGAIN HE DID NOT GIVE IT TO ME YOU SEE HE MERELY LET ME TAKE IT ON MY JOURNEY TO PROTECT ME
AND BEGAN TO MAKE A WHISTLE OUT OF THE PIG'S TAIL WITH HIS POCKET KNIFE NOW FARMER BOWSER WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAWING THE WOOD FOUND IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE PIG SO HE TOOK A PAIL OF MEAL AND WENT TO THE PIGSTY
I MUST PUT A SQUEAK IN IT SAID SANTA SO HE TOOK A BOX OF SQUEAKS FROM A SHELF AND PUT ONE INTO THE RABBIT BEFORE HE SEWED IT UP WHEN IT WAS ALL FINISHED HE PRESSED THE TOY RABBIT WITH HIS THUMB AND IT SQUEAKED SO NATURALLY THAT I JUMPED OFF THE TABLE
IF I WENT TO HIS HOUSE HE DID LAST WEEK YOU KNOW
BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE WINTER IN WINTER WE RABBITS SAID BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY AND DO YOU EVER SEE HIM ASKED THE GIRL EAGERLY OH YES EVERY WINTER
SO AFTER MOTHER HUBBARD HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD MEAL OF TURNIPS AND SLICED CABBAGE SANTA CLAUS PUT THE MAGIC COLLAR AROUND MY NECK AND I STARTED FOR HOME I TOOK MY TIME ON THE JOURNEY FOR I KNEW NOTHING COULD HARM ME
AS MY SISTERS HAD EVIDENTLY BECOME ATTACHED TO YOU AND YOUR SOCIETY GAVE THEM UNUSUAL PLEASURE I DEEMED IT INEXPEDIENT TO BREAK IN ON YOUR MUTUAL COMFORT TILL THEIR APPROACHING DEPARTURE FROM MARSH END SHOULD RENDER YOURS NECESSARY
HE NEVER DID ANY WORK EXCEPT TO PLAY THE PIPES AND HE PLAYED SO BADLY THAT FEW PENNIES EVER FOUND THEIR WAY INTO HIS POUCH IT WAS WHISPERED AROUND THAT OLD BARNEY WAS NOT VERY HONEST
WHO WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THE GIRL SPEAK IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE IN SUMMER TIME I SEE THE CLOVER LEAVES THAT I LOVE TO FEED UPON AND THE CABBAGES AT THE END OF THE FARMER'S GARDEN I SEE THE COOL BUSHES WHERE I CAN HIDE FROM MY ENEMIES
DEVELOPED FOR ME IN THESE REGIONS THE SAME ATTRACTION AS FOR THEM WOUND ROUND MY FACULTIES THE SAME SPELL THAT ENTRANCED THEIRS INDOORS WE AGREED EQUALLY WELL
OR FALLING DOWN AND HURTING THEMSELVES AND THESE HAD TO BE COMFORTED AND SOME WERE NAUGHTY AND HAD TO BE WHIPPED AND SOME WERE DIRTY AND HAD TO BE WASHED AND SOME WERE GOOD AND HAD TO BE KISSED IT WAS GRAN'MA DO THIS AND GRAN'MA DO THAT FROM MORNING TO NIGHT

BUT IT WAS A GOOD AND WHOLESOME DIET AND THE CHILDREN THRIVED AND GREW FAT UPON IT ONE DAY A STRANGER CAME ALONG THE ROAD AND WHEN HE SAW THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE HE BEGAN TO LAUGH WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SIR
AND AS SHE PUT THE NIGHTDRESS ON EACH ONE SHE GAVE IT A SOUND WHIPPING AND SENT IT TO BED THEY CRIED SOME OF COURSE BUT THEY KNEW VERY WELL THEY DESERVED THE PUNISHMENT AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE ALL OF THEM WERE SOUND ASLEEP
A PLACE WHERE THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA STICKS UP THROUGH THE WATER ISOLATION

THEN A FLIGHT OF ARROWS CAME FROM THE BUSHES AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BLUNT AND COULD DO HIM NO HARM THEY RATTLED ALL OVER HIS BODY AND ONE HIT HIS NOSE AND ANOTHER HIS CHIN WHILE SEVERAL STUCK FAST IN THE LOAVES OF BREAD ALTOGETHER THE BAKER MAN WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
AND SOON PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT THE QUEER HOUSE AND THEY USUALLY WENT AWAY LAUGHING THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT MIND THIS AT ALL SHE WAS TOO BUSY TO BE ANGRY
BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THEM SETTLED IN THEIR NEW HOME WHEN MARGARET ANOTHER OF HER DAUGHTERS DIED AND SENT FOUR MORE CHILDREN TO HER MOTHER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF THE OLD WOMAN SCARCELY KNEW WHERE TO KEEP THIS NEW FLOCK THAT HAD COME TO HER FOLD
AND HAS MARRIED THEM ALL HAPPILY SHE IS SURELY ENTITLED TO PASS HER REMAINING DAYS IN PEACE AND COMFORT SHE LIVED IN A PECULIAR LITTLE HOUSE THAT LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE THIS PICTURE
COULD QUITE SUBDUE THE SPARKLE OF HER STARRY HOPES NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS NOT SO RAPT FROM THINGS OF EARTH AS TO BE UNABLE TO NOTICE THAT CHRISTINE'S WALK WAS DECIDEDLY UNGRACEFUL BUT I SUPPOSE GILBERT LOOKS ONLY AT HER FACE
AND WHEN ALL THE SIXTEEN SMALL INDIANS RUSHED FROM THE BUSHES AND FLOURISHED THEIR TOMAHAWKS HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND RAN DOWN THE HILL AS FAST AS HE COULD GO WHEN THE GRANDMOTHER RETURNED SHE ASKED WHERE IS THE BREAD FOR YOUR SUPPER

I HAVE NEVER LIKED CATS SAID MISSUS GARDNER REMOTELY I LOVE THEM SAID DOROTHY THEY ARE SO NICE AND SELFISH DOGS ARE TOO GOOD AND UNSELFISH THEY MAKE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BUT CATS ARE GLORIOUSLY HUMAN
AND THE FLOWER BEDS TRAMPLED INTO SHAPELESS MASSES BY THIRTY TWO LITTLE FEET THAT RAN ABOUT FROM MORN TILL NIGHT BUT THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT COMPLAIN AT THIS
YOU WON'T FAIL HOW DID YOU GET ON IN GREEK TODAY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WAS A GOOD PAPER AND PERHAPS IT WAS BAD ENOUGH TO MAKE HOMER TURN OVER IN HIS GRAVE I'VE STUDIED AND MULLED OVER NOTEBOOKS UNTIL I'M INCAPABLE OF FORMING AN OPINION OF ANYTHING
ALSO HAD FOUR SMALL CHILDREN THAT MUST BE CARED FOR IN SOME WAY THE OLD WOMAN HAVING TAKEN THE OTHER TWELVE COULD NOT WELL REFUSE TO ADOPT THESE LITTLE ORPHANS ALSO I MAY AS WELL HAVE SIXTEEN AS A DOZEN SHE SAID WITH A SIGH
WITH WHITE GRAVEL PATHS AND MANY BEDS OF BRIGHT COLORED FLOWERS THE OLD WOMAN WAS VERY HAPPY AND CONTENTED THERE UNTIL ONE DAY SHE RECEIVED A LETTER SAYING THAT HER DAUGHTER HANNAH WAS DEAD AND HAD SENT HER FAMILY OF FIVE CHILDREN TO THEIR GRANDMOTHER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF
THE HOUSE PRESENTED A VERY QUEER APPEARANCE NOW BUT SHE DID NOT MIND THAT SO LONG AS THE BABIES WERE COMFORTABLE I SHALL NOT HAVE TO BUILD AGAIN SHE SAID AND THAT IS ONE SATISFACTION I HAVE NOW NO MORE DAUGHTERS TO DIE AND LEAVE ME THEIR CHILDREN
ANNE WALKED IN SILENCE PHIL CHATTERED OF MANY THINGS SUDDENLY SHE SAID
SOME OF THE CHILDREN HEARD HIM SAY THIS AND THEY RESOLVED TO PLAY HIM A TRICK IN RETURN FOR HIS ILL NATURED SPEECH THE BAKER MAN CAME EVERY DAY TO THE SHOE HOUSE AND BROUGHT TWO GREAT BASKETS OF BREAD
I'M THE ONLY ONE OF THE FAMILY HE TELLS THINGS TO POOR BOY NOBODY COULD CONFIDE IN MAMMA AND ALINE YOU KNOW WHAT GLORIOUS TIMES YOU GIRLS MUST HAVE HERE WON'T YOU LET ME COME OFTEN AND HAVE A SHARE IN THEM COME AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE ANNE RESPONDED HEARTILY
MY DAUGHTER USED TO WRITE STORIES BEFORE SHE WENT TO THE FOREIGN FIELD BUT NOW SHE HAS TURNED HER ATTENTION TO HIGHER THINGS SHE USED TO SAY HER MOTTO WAS NEVER WRITE A LINE YOU WOULD BE ASHAMED TO READ AT YOUR OWN FUNERAL YOU'D BETTER TAKE THAT FOR YOURS ANNE
SAID ANNE NEVER MIND I BEGIN FAINTLY TO DISCERN CLEAR WATER AHEAD WHERE NO EXAMINATION BREAKERS LOOM GIRLS DO YOU CAN YOU REALIZE THAT OUR REDMOND LIFE IS ALMOST OVER I CAN'T SAID ANNE SORROWFULLY
THE YOUNGSTERS WERE LIKE ALL OTHER CHILDREN AND GOT INTO MISCHIEF ONCE IN AWHILE BUT THE OLD WOMAN HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH CHILDREN AND MANAGED TO KEEP THEM IN ORDER VERY WELL WHILE THEY QUICKLY LEARNED TO OBEY HER AND GENERALLY DID AS THEY WERE BID
ASKED THE GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS SITTING UPON HER DOORSTEPS ENGAGED IN MENDING SIXTEEN PAIRS OF STOCKINGS AT YOUR HOUSE THE STRANGER REPLIED IT LOOKS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A BIG SHOE A SHOE SHE SAID IN SURPRISE WHY YES
COLLEGE CIRCLES EXPECTED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER ENGAGEMENT TO ROY ANY DAY ANNE EXPECTED IT HERSELF YET JUST BEFORE SHE LEFT PATTY'S PLACE FOR CONVOCATION SHE FLUNG ROY'S VIOLETS ASIDE AND PUT GILBERT'S LILIES OF THE VALLEY IN THEIR PLACE
BUT HER EYES WANDERED TO ANOTHER BOX ON HER TABLE IT WAS FILLED WITH LILIES OF THE VALLEY AS FRESH AND FRAGRANT AS THOSE WHICH BLOOMED IN THE GREEN GABLES YARD WHEN JUNE CAME TO AVONLEA
IF YOU ARE GOING TO EMBARK IN LITERATURE THOUGH TO BE SURE ADDED
SO LIKE A MAN THOUGHT ANNE SCORNFULLY SHALL YOU BE HOME SATURDAY AFTERNOON ASKED ROY YES MY MOTHER AND SISTERS ARE COMING TO CALL ON YOU SAID ROY QUIETLY SOMETHING WENT OVER ANNE WHICH MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS A THRILL
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX THE GARDNERS'CALL HERE IS A LETTER WITH AN INDIAN STAMP FOR YOU AUNT JIMSIE SAID PHIL HERE ARE THREE FOR STELLA AND TWO FOR PRIS AND A GLORIOUS FAT ONE FOR ME FROM JO
THAT OF THE BREATHLESS MOMENT WHEN THE STATELY PRESIDENT OF REDMOND GAVE HER CAP AND DIPLOMA AND HAILED HER B A IT WAS NOT OF THE FLASH IN GILBERT'S EYES WHEN HE SAW HER LILIES NOR THE PUZZLED PAINED GLANCE ROY GAVE HER AS HE PASSED HER ON THE PLATFORM
STAGE DOOR SECRETS ICE A SUBSTANCE FREQUENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH A TUMBLE IN WINTER A TUMBLER IN SUMMER AND A SKATE THE YEAR AROUND
JEW A HEBREW AND HARP A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THE JEW'S MUSICAL INSTRUMENT BEING A SELL LOW OLD SPELLING
GILBERT HAD CALLED HER CARROTS AND VAINLY TRIED TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH A PINK CANDY HEART HAD WRITTEN HIM A NICE LITTLE NOTE OF THANKS BUT SHE HAD NEVER WORN THE TRINKET TONIGHT SHE FASTENED IT ABOUT HER WHITE THROAT WITH A DREAMY SMILE SHE AND PHIL WALKED TO REDMOND TOGETHER
THE OLD WOMAN WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED WHEN SHE HEARD OF THIS NEW ADDITION TO HER FAMILY BUT SHE DID NOT GIVE WAY TO DESPAIR SHE SENT FOR THE CARPENTER AGAIN AND HAD HIM BUILD ANOTHER ADDITION TO HER HOUSE AS THE PICTURE SHOWS
THERE IS SO MUCH IN THE WORLD FOR US ALL IF WE ONLY HAVE THE EYES TO SEE IT AND THE HEART TO LOVE IT AND THE HAND TO GATHER IT TO OURSELVES SO MUCH IN MEN AND WOMEN SO MUCH IN ART AND LITERATURE SO MUCH EVERYWHERE IN WHICH TO DELIGHT
SHE HAD NEVER MET ANY OF ROY'S FAMILY SHE REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HIS STATEMENT AND IT HAD SOMEHOW AN IRREVOCABLENESS ABOUT IT THAT CHILLED HER I SHALL BE GLAD TO SEE THEM SHE SAID FLATLY AND THEN WONDERED IF SHE REALLY WOULD BE GLAD SHE OUGHT TO BE OF COURSE
I SPENT IT USEFULLY FOR CLOTHES AND HATED THEM EVERY TIME I PUT THEM ON THINK OF HAVING A REAL LIVE AUTHOR AT PATTY'S PLACE SAID PRISCILLA
AND ANY ONE WHO HASN'T CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS SO THERE IS NO NEED OF DEFINING IT THE BUSY DAYS FLEW BY AND EXAMINATIONS WERE OVER ANNE TOOK HIGH HONORS IN ENGLISH PRISCILLA TOOK HONORS IN CLASSICS AND PHIL IN MATHEMATICS
AUTHORS ARE KITTLE CATTLE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN OR HOW THEY WILL BREAK OUT ANNE MAY MAKE COPY OF US I MEANT THAT THE ABILITY TO WRITE FOR THE PRESS WAS A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY SAID AUNT JAMESINA SEVERELY AND I HOPE ANNE REALIZES IT
OR DOROTHY'S ARDENT IMPULSIVE GOOD WISHES IT WAS OF ONE STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE PANG THAT SPOILED THIS LONG EXPECTED DAY FOR HER AND LEFT IN IT A CERTAIN FAINT BUT ENDURING FLAVOR OF BITTERNESS
THIS MISFORTUNE RUINED ALL THE OLD WOMAN'S DREAMS OF QUIET BUT THE NEXT DAY THE CHILDREN ARRIVED THREE BOYS AND TWO GIRLS AND SHE MADE THE BEST OF IT AND GAVE THEM THE BEDS HER OWN DAUGHTERS HAD ONCE OCCUPIED AND HER OWN COT AS WELL
BUT WOULD IT NOT BE SOMETHING OF AN ORDEAL GOSSIP HAD FILTERED TO ANNE REGARDING THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE GARDNERS VIEWED THE INFATUATION OF SON AND BROTHER ROY MUST HAVE BROUGHT PRESSURE TO BEAR IN THE MATTER OF THIS CALL ANNE KNEW SHE WOULD BE WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE
WILDLY PLUNGED THE CHOCOLATE CAKE UNDER A CUSHION ON THE INGLENOOK SOFA AND DASHED UPSTAIRS STELLA BEGAN FEVERISHLY GATHERING UP HER MANUSCRIPT ONLY AUNT JAMESINA AND PHIL REMAINED NORMAL THANKS TO THEM EVERYBODY WAS SOON SITTING AT EASE EVEN ANNE
BUT WOULD DO HER HAIR LOW FRIDAY AFTERNOON NONE OF THE GIRLS HAD CLASSES AT REDMOND STELLA TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE A PAPER FOR THE PHILOMATHIC SOCIETY AND WAS SITTING AT THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE LIVING ROOM
YOU DON'T ACT AS IF YOU WERE BY TIMES SAID AUNT JAMESINA SEVERELY OH AUNT JIMSIE HAVEN'T WE BEEN PRETTY GOOD GIRLS TAKE US BY AND LARGE THESE THREE WINTERS YOU'VE MOTHERED US PLEADED PHIL
OF COURSE IT WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE NINE SMALL CHILDREN THAN FIVE AND THEY OFTEN LED EACH OTHER INTO MISCHIEF SO THAT THE FLOWER BEDS BEGAN TO BE TRAMPLED UPON AND THE GREEN GRASS TO BE WORN UNDER THE CONSTANT TREAD OF LITTLE FEET
IF YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH BOTH WISHES WILL COME TRUE SAID ANNE CALMLY IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO BE SERENE YOU'RE AT HOME IN PHILOSOPHY I'M NOT AND WHEN I THINK OF THAT HORRIBLE PAPER TOMORROW I QUAIL IF I SHOULD FAIL IN IT WHAT WOULD JO SAY
MEANING MONEY AN INVENTION FOR BURNING MONEY INCOME THE RELIABLE OFFSPRING OF A WISE INVESTMENT FROM LAT IN
AN IMPLEMENT EMPLOYED BY MEN OF ACQUISITIVE NATURES WHO CANNOT AFFORD SEATS IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE JOB AN UNCERTAIN COMMODITY REGULATED BY A UNION CARD JOCKEY
AND THERE WAS SUCH AN UPROAR THAT THEIR GRANDMOTHER HAD TO PUT COTTON IN HER EARS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE HER HEARING BUT SHE KEPT HER PROMISE AND MADE THEM EAT THEIR BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO BREAD TO GIVE THEM THEN SHE STOOD THEM IN A ROW AND UNDRESSED THEM
AND ALINE WOULD NEVER LIKE HER THOUGH MISSUS GARDNER MIGHT BE WON ALTOGETHER ANNE SIGHED WITH RELIEF WHEN THE ORDEAL WAS OVER OF ALL SAD WORDS OF TONGUE OR PEN THE SADDEST ARE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUOTED PRISCILLA TRAGICALLY LIFTING THE CUSHION
THE CHILDREN LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN SURPRISE FOR THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE BREAD AND THEN ONE OF THEM CONFESSED AND TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY OF HOW THEY HAD FRIGHTENED THE BAKER MAN FOR SAYING HE WOULD SEND THEM TO THE POOR HOUSE
FROM JOG TO MOVE SLOWLY AND KEY SOMETHING THAT MAKES FAST HENCE ONE WHO MAKES THE PACE FAST OR SLOW ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS JOINT EITHER A LOW LIMB
ANNE'S EYES SHONE ALL THAT DAY LITERARY AMBITIONS SPROUTED AND BUDDED IN HER BRAIN THEIR EXHILARATION ACCOMPANIED HER TO JENNIE COOPER'S WALKING PARTY AND NOT EVEN THE SIGHT OF GILBERT AND CHRISTINE WALKING JUST AHEAD OF HER AND ROY
WHO HANDS YOU A MINT AND GIVES YOU A SWEET SPIRIT FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY A BUN JURY TWELVE MEN CHOSEN TO DECIDE WHO HAS THE BETTER LAWYER
WELL I SUPPOSE THE LORD DOESN'T REGARD THE EARS OF A MAN SAID AUNT JAMESINA GRAVELY DROPPING ALL FURTHER CRITICISM OF MOODY SPURGEON
PICKING UP MAGOG SHE SAT DOWN ON THE CUSHION UNDER WHICH WAS SECRETED PRISCILLA'S CHOCOLATE CAKE PRISCILLA AND ANNE EXCHANGED AGONIZED GLANCES BUT COULD DO NOTHING
LIES HAVE NO LEGS THAT'S WHY WE ALL HAVE TO STAND FOR THEM JACK AN INSTRUMENT REQUIRING A STRONG ARM AND USED FOR RAISING HEAVY WEIGHTS OR FOR PULLING OFF THE BOOTS
YOU ARE SIXTEEN VERY NAUGHTY CHILDREN EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN AND FOR PUNISHMENT YOU MUST EAT YOUR BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD AND AFTERWARDS EACH ONE SHALL HAVE A SOUND WHIPPING AND BE SENT TO BED THEN ALL THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO CRY AT ONCE
FROM THE BUTCHER OR A LOW QUARTER IN TOWN IN EITHER CASE THE LOWER THE TOUGHER JOKE A FORM OF HUMOR ENJOYED BY SOME AND MISUNDERSTOOD BY MOST IN ENGLAND REQUIRING A DIAGRAM
THIS CAKE IS NOW WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A FLAT FAILURE AND THE CUSHION IS LIKEWISE RUINED NEVER TELL ME THAT FRIDAY ISN'T UNLUCKY PEOPLE WHO SEND WORD THEY ARE COMING ON SATURDAY SHOULDN'T COME ON FRIDAY SAID AUNT JAMESINA
IT COST SO MUCH MONEY TO CLOTHE THEM
THE CHILDREN ALL PAINTED THEIR FACES TO LOOK AS INDIANS DO WHEN THEY ARE ON THE WARPATH AND THEY CAUGHT THE ROOSTERS AND THE TURKEY COCK AND PULLED FEATHERS FROM THEIR TAILS TO STICK IN THEIR HAIR AND THEN THE BOYS MADE WOODEN TOMAHAWKS FOR THE GIRLS AND BOWS AND ARROWS FOR THEIR OWN USE
WITH A TINY PINK ENAMEL HEART AS A PENDANT ON THE ACCOMPANYING CARD WAS WRITTEN WITH ALL GOOD WISHES FROM YOUR OLD CHUM GILBERT ANNE LAUGHING OVER THE MEMORY THE ENAMEL HEART CONJURED UP THE FATAL DAY WHEN
THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU ANNE EXCEPT A CIRCULAR NOBODY NOTICED ANNE'S FLUSH AS SHE TOOK THE THIN LETTER PHIL TOSSED HER CARELESSLY BUT A FEW MINUTES LATER PHIL LOOKED UP TO SEE A TRANSFIGURED ANNE HONEY WHAT GOOD THING HAS HAPPENED
TO CON OR JOSH JOLLY BOAT THE SHIP OF STATE JUDGE ONE WHO SITS ON A BENCH IN A COURT FRAMES SENTENCES AND FINISHES CROOKS FOR A LIVING AND SWEARS CONTINUALLY
NO SAID ANNE I THINK IT'S TRUE SAID PHIL LIGHTLY ANNE DID NOT SPEAK IN THE DARKNESS SHE FELT HER FACE BURNING SHE SLIPPED HER HAND INSIDE HER COLLAR AND CAUGHT AT THE GOLD CHAIN
WHO NEVER SPOILED A COMPLIMENT BY MISPLACED ECONOMY BUT I MISTRUST YOU HAVEN'T ANY TOO MUCH SENSE YET IT'S NOT TO BE EXPECTED OF COURSE EXPERIENCE TEACHES SENSE YOU CAN'T LEARN IT IN A COLLEGE COURSE
THEY TOOK CARE NOT TO PLAY ANY MORE TRICKS ON THE BAKER MAN AND AS THEY GREW OLDER THEY WERE NATURALLY MUCH BETTER BEHAVED BEFORE MANY YEARS THE BOYS WERE OLD ENOUGH TO WORK FOR THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AND THAT MADE THE WOMAN'S FAMILY A GOOD DEAL SMALLER
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO BE THE ICEMAN IDIOT
THE WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE SHE HAD SO MANY CHILDREN
MAKE A JEST OF YOUR DIFFICULTIES BUT OVERCOME THEM ISN'T THAT WORTH LEARNING AUNT JIMSIE YES IT IS DEARIE WHEN YOU'VE LEARNED TO LAUGH AT THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE LAUGHED AT AND NOT TO LAUGH AT THOSE THAT SHOULDN'T YOU'VE GOT WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING
THERE ARE SO MANY CHILDREN SHE SAID ONE DAY TO THE BAKER MAN THAT I OFTEN REALLY DO N'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
AND THEN ALL SIXTEEN WENT OUT AND HID IN THE BUSHES NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL BY AND BY THE BAKER MAN CAME SLOWLY UP THE PATH WITH A BASKET OF BREAD ON EITHER ARM AND JUST AS HE REACHED THE BUSHES THERE SOUNDED IN HIS EARS A MOST UNEARTHLY WAR WHOOP
ANNE IN HER FLANNEL BLOUSE AND SERGE SKIRT WITH HER HAIR RATHER BLOWN FROM HER WINDY WALK HOME WAS SITTING SQUARELY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR TEASING THE SARAH CAT WITH A WISHBONE JOSEPH AND RUSTY WERE BOTH CURLED UP IN HER LAP
THE ARTS GRADUATES GAVE A GRADUATION DANCE THAT NIGHT WHEN ANNE DRESSED FOR IT SHE TOSSED ASIDE THE PEARL BEADS SHE USUALLY WORE AND TOOK FROM HER TRUNK THE SMALL BOX THAT HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES ON CHRISTMAS DAY IN IT WAS A THREAD LIKE GOLD CHAIN
ONE ENERGETIC TWIST AND IT GAVE WAY ANNE THRUST THE BROKEN TRINKET INTO HER POCKET HER HANDS WERE TREMBLING AND HER EYES WERE SMARTING BUT SHE WAS THE GAYEST OF ALL THE GAY REVELLERS THAT NIGHT AND TOLD GILBERT UNREGRETFULLY
RUSTY AND JOSEPH LEFT TO THEMSELVES BEGAN A GAME OF CHASE AND SPRANG MADLY INTO MISSUS GARDNER'S SILKEN LAP AND OUT OF IT IN THEIR WILD CAREER MISSUS GARDNER LIFTED HER LORGNETTE
MEANING A LOAD PACKED ON THE OUTSIDE OF A VAN IN AMERICA THE LOAD IS PACKED ON THE INSIDE OF A MAN
COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN FOR THE PRESENT IN THE MOURNFUL TRAGIC HOUSE THEREFORE HE WOULD CRUSH HIS JUSTIFIABLE ANGER
DEAD OR ALIVE OR WHICH SHOULD THROW ANY LIGHT UPON HIS FATE HAND BILLS PROCLAIMING THIS REWARD AND DESCRIBING THE MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE WERE EXHIBITED IN EVERY BAR ROOM AND OTHER CONSPICUOUS PLACE THROUGHOUT WESTCHESTER AND THE ADJACENT TOWNSHIPS
AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME
GRAHAM INTERRUPTED WITH A FLAT DEMAND FOR AN EXPLANATION HOW DID YOU GET AWAY
AFTER THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT PAREDES'S DETENTION HE HADN'T DREAMED THAT HIS WEARINESS COULD PLACATE EVEN MOMENTARILY SUCH REFLECTIONS BUT AT LAST HE SLEPT AGAIN
HAVE I ANY RIGHT DON'T GRAHAM SAID I'LL BE WITH YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT
PRAECORDIA BOARD AN IMPLEMENT FOR ADMINISTERING CORPORAL PUNISHMENT USED BY MOTHERS AND LAND LADIES THE FESTIVE BOARD MAY BE A SHINGLE A HAIR BRUSH
BY STANDER ONE WHO IS INJURED IN A STREET FIGHT
I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
WHAT YOUR FRIENDS CALL YOU BEFORE YOU GO TO THE WALL BUT NEVER AFTERWARD BRIMSTONE A LITTLE BIT OF HADES WHICH FINDS ITS MATCH ON EARTH AND SMELLS TO HEAVEN BETTER TO STRIKE IT HERE THAN IN THE HEREAFTER BREVITY
NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
BOBBY HANDED HIM A BANKNOTE HE DIDN'T MISS GRAHAM'S MEANING GLANCE
NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
WHEN BOBBY HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HE FOUND IN SPITE OF HIS MENTAL TURMOIL THAT HIS SLEEP HAD DONE HIM GOOD WHILE HE BREAKFASTED GRAHAM URGED HIM TO EAT TRIED TO DRIVE FROM HIS BRAIN THE MORBID AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S REVEALING MOMENT
LAPIERRE GAVE UP ALL HIS TIME TO THE SEARCH AND LEFT THE ROYAL OAK TO THE CARE OF ITS LANDLADY THE LOCAL CONSTABULARY BESTIRRED THEMSELVES AS THEY HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
THAT FLEETING SATANIC IMPRESSION OF YESTERDAY CAME BACK SHARPER MORE ALARMING PAREDES'S CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH HIS MIND WAS SUBTLER THAN THEIRS
HENCE AN UNATTACHED MAN WHICH ANY LADY MAY STICK STICK TO OR GET STUCK ON BACKBITER A MOSQUITO BALANCE SOMETHING WANTED BY BOOK KEEPERS AND OFTEN LOST BY TOPERS
SQUIRE HARRINGTON WENT DOWN TO TOWN AND MADE INQUIRIES AT THE BANK WHERE HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE STORY TOLD BY SAVAREEN TO OLD JONATHAN PERRY
FROM A SENSE OF SHAME ANGER OR OTHER CAUSE
DULL CLOUDS OBSCURED THE SUN AND FURNISHED AN ILLUSION OF CROWDING EARTHWARD A FUNEREAL DAY THE WORDS SLIPPED INTO HIS MIND HE REPEATED THEM WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BURIED GRAHAM ANSWERED SOFTLY WE'LL ALL FEEL HAPPIER WHY BOBBY ASKED
FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
BONE ONE DOLLAR THE ORIGINAL PRICE OF A WIFE NOTE ADAM WHO HAD TO GIVE UP ONE BONE BEFORE HE GOT EVE BONNETS A FEMALE HEAD TROUBLE WHICH IS CONTRACTED THE LATTER PART OF LENT AND BREAKS OUT ON EASTER BOODLE
ADVERTISEMENTS SETTING FORTH THE MAIN FACTS WERE INSERTED IN THE PRINCIPAL NEWSPAPERS OF TORONTO HAMILTON AND LONDON
BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
A STRIP OF SAND SKIRTED BY WATER COVERED WITH LADY KILLERS IN SUMMER LIFE SAVERS IN WINTER
HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
WHERE A MAN'S BODY MIGHT POSSIBLY LIE CONCEALED EVERY TRACT OF BUSH AND WOODLAND EVERY BARN AND OUT BUILDING EVERY HOLLOW AND DITCH EVERY FIELD AND FENCE CORNER WAS EXPLORED WITH CAREFUL MINUTENESS EVEN THE WELLS OF THE DISTRICT WERE PEERED INTO
AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
HE STROLLED OVER AND HANDED BOBBY A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS WHERE'S ROBINSON BOBBY ASKED I SAW HIM IN THE COURT A WHILE AGO I DARESAY HE'S WANDERING AROUND PERHAPS WATCHING THE MEN AT THE GRAVE HE LEARNED NOTHING NEW LAST NIGHT I WAS WITH HIM AT BREAKFAST I GATHER NOT
BUT THE HORSE WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THAT TWO LIVING SUBSTANCES OF SUCH BULK SHOULD PASS OUT OF BEING AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND THEM THEY MUST LITERALLY HAVE MELTED INTO THIN AIR NO THEY HADN'T AT LEAST THE BLACK MARE HADN'T
THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
HUMAN BLOCK KNOWN AS THE CRANIUM AND KEPT BY THE SARAH SISTERS SARAH BRUM AND SARAH BELUM ASSISTED BY MEDULLA OBLONGATA
TO A MAN SHE IS PLAYING FOR A JAY BIRTHDAY ANNIVERSARY OF ONE'S BIRTH OBSERVED ONLY BY MEN AND CHILDREN BLUBBER THE USEFUL PRODUCT OF A DEAD WHALE THE USELESS PRODUCT OF A LIVE BABY
ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO LEARN HOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE APPARENT MIRACLES
FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
FROM THE CHEST OF DRAWERS TWO CANDLES THE ONLY LIGHT
AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
WONDERFUL PARENTS ARE YET TO BE HEARD FROM WHO DON'T THINK THEIRS IS A WONDER A NOCTURNAL ANIMAL TO WHICH EVERYONE IN A SLEEPING CAR IS EAGER TO GIVE A WIDE BERTH BACHELOR FROM LATIN BACULUS A STICK UNATTACHED
GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
THE BIT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM HER MOUTH BUT THE BRIDLE HUNG INTACT ROUND HER NECK THE SADDLE HOWEVER LIKE ITS OWNER HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HER BACK THEN THE MEN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SWAMP THEY SOON CAME UPON THE SADDLE WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DELIBERATELY UNBUCKLED
THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
BOBBY FORCED HIMSELF TO WALK UP THE STAIRCASE FACING THE FIRST PHASE OF HIS ORDEAL HE SAW THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REALIZED THAT TOO FOR HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND FOLLOWED BY RAWLINS STARTED UPWARD THE ENTIRE COMPANY CROWDED THE STAIRS
THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
HE WAS AROUSED BY THE TRAMPING OF MEN AROUND THE HOUSE AND STRANGE HARSH VOICES HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND GLANCED FROM THE WINDOW IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT TWO BURLY FELLOWS IN OVERALLS CARRYING PICK AND SPADE ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
DISTINGUISHED FROM MENU BY FIGURES IN THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN BIOGRAPH A STEREOPTICON PICTURE TAKEN WITH A CHILL AND SHOWN WITH TREMORS BIRDIE
AS BELONG TO SAVAREEN IT WAS WET AND BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND IN FACT WAS LYING HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A LITTLE PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN IT WAS FOUND THEN THE SEARCHERS MADE SURE OF FINDING THE BODY BUT IN THIS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED
THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO WAKE YOU UP THE MINISTER'S TELEPHONED KATHERINE HE WILL BE HERE BEFORE NOON DO YOU KNOW IT'S AFTER TEN O'CLOCK FOR SOME TIME BOBBY STARED THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE DESOLATE RAGGED LANDSCAPE IT WAS ABNORMALLY COLD EVEN FOR THE LATE FALL
GRAHAM SUMMONED KATHERINE ONE OF THE BLACK CLOTHED MEN OPENED THE DOOR OF SILAS BLACKBURN'S ROOM HE STEPPED ASIDE BECKONING
THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
AND WHITE AND FURNISHED WITH LIGHT AND HEAT HOT OR COLD WATER IF DESIRED
WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT THIS EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY AS TO JONATHAN AND HIS WIFE HAVING MISTAKEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SAVAREEN SQUIRE HARRINGTON LIKEWISE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE MAN'S DOINGS ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
BIRTH AN AID TO LIFE DISCOVERED BY WOMAN HIGHER PREFERRED BICYCLE SKIRT
FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
THE SEARCH WAS KEPT UP WITHOUT INTERMISSION FOR SEVERAL DAYS NEARLY ALL OF THE FARMERS IN THE VICINITY TAKING PART IN IT EVEN TO THE NEGLECT OF THE HARVEST WORK WHICH DEMANDED THEIR ATTENTION SQUIRE HARRINGTON WAS ESPECIALLY ACTIVE AND LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY
HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
A STITCH IN TIME SAVES EMBARRASSING EXPOSURE
PAY HIM WILL YOU JENKINS THANKS
BOWER A SHADY RETREAT IN GENERAL BOWERY A SHADY RETREAT IN NEW YORK BRACE SECURITY FOR THE TROUSERS BRACER SECURITY FOR THE STOMACH BRACELET SECURITY FOR THE PAWN BROKER BRAIN
HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY
YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
YOU SEE I SPENT A GOOD DEAL IN SMITHTOWN YESTERDAY
WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
FACT IS BOBBY I LEFT NEW YORK TOO SUDDENLY
IT WON'T LESSEN THE FACT OF HIS MURDER TIME GRAHAM SAID LESSENS SUCH FACTS EVEN FOR THE POLICE BOBBY GLANCED AT HIM FLUSHING YOU MEAN YOU'VE DECIDED TO STAND BY ME AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT GRAHAM SMILED
IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
FOR SHE WAS DISCOVERED BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SEARCHING PARTY A LITTLE BEFORE NOON WHEN FOUND SHE WAS QUIETLY CROPPING THE DAMP HERBAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE CRANBERRY SWAMP AT THE REAR OF SQUIRE HARRINGTON'S FARM SHE WAS WHOLLY UNINJURED AND HAD EVIDENTLY SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
I SLEPT LIKE A TOP LAST NIGHT I HEARD NOTHING I SAW NOTHING OUGHT I TO WANT YOU TO STAND BY ME BOBBY SAID OUGHTN'T I TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
NO I WON'T BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN WEAK HARTLEY BUT NOT THAT WEAK AND I TELL YOU I DID FEEL HOWELLS'S BODY MOVE UNDER MY HAND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME GRAHAM SAID GENTLY I MUST CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBILITY YOU WERE EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE WHEN YOU WENT TO THE OLD ROOM TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE
BATHE AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST THEN WE CAN DECIDE THERE'S NO USE TALKING OF THE OTHER THING I'VE FORGOTTEN IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE YOU MUST BOBBY SPRANG UPRIGHT HOW CAN I FORGET IT
THE MANAGER TOOK MY ADVICE BUT MARIA'S STILL MISSING
BARS THINGS FOUND IN HARBORS HOTELS FENCES PRISONS COURTS AND MUSIC
AND HE HAD ASKED FOR MONEY ONLY A TRIFLING SUM YET GRAHAM WOULD GRASP AT THE FACT TO SUPPORT HIS EARLIER SUSPICION PAREDES'S ARRIVAL POSSESSED ONE VIRTUE IT DIVERTED BOBBY'S THOUGHTS TEMPORARILY FROM HIS OWN DILEMMA FROM HIS INABILITY TO CHART A COURSE
IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY
OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
AND DEVELOPED IN DEPARTMENT STORES ON MONDAYS SYMPTOMS LOUD TALK PUSHING AND SHOVING A COMBINATION PRIZE FIGHT AND FOOT BALL SCRIMMAGE OLD SPELLING BARK GAIN BASEBALL
BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
BUT FOUND NOTHING FURTHER TO REWARD THEIR SEARCH THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT AND MARSHY TO RETAIN ANY TRACES OF FOOTSTEPS AND THE MARE AND SADDLE FURNISHED THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SWAMP AND OF COURSE THIS EVIDENCE WAS OF THE MOST VAGUE AND INCONCLUSIVE CHARACTER
I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
USUALLY OCCUPIED BY THE INTELLECT BROTHERS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
GRAHAM ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ILL AT EASE
CAN BE FOUND ON THE OUTSIDE OF A SHORT RED STEER OR THE INSIDE OF A LONG BLACK BOTTLE BRASS BAND A CLEVER THOUGH SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED ARRANGEMENT FOR HOLDING A CROWD TOGETHER BRICK AN ADMIRABLE PERSON MADE OF THE RIGHT SORT OF CLAY AND POSSESSING PLENTY OF SAND
YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
SUCH A FIGURE WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE CEDARS
HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
MAY BE FOUND IN A CASH BOOK OR THE KANGAROO GAIT BANDIT AN OUTLAW SEE ALDERMAN BARBER A BRILLIANT CONVERSATIONALIST WHO OCCASIONALLY SHAVES AND CUTS HAIR
ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
HIS SHARP EXCLAMATION RECALLED HOWELLS'S REPORT WHICH AT THEIR DIRECTION HE HAD FAILED TO MAIL HAD HIS EXCLAMATION BEEN DRAWN BY AN ACCUSER BOBBY STARTED TO RISE GRAHAM MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR THEN JENKINS ENTERED AND STOOD TO ONE SIDE
BLUE THE ONLY COLOR WE CAN FEEL INVISIBLE BLUE A POLICEMAN BLUSH A TEMPORARY ERYTHEMA AND CALORIFIC EFFULGENCE OF THE PHYSIOGNOMY AETEOLOGIZED BY THE PERCEPTIVENESS OF THE SENSORIUM
THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
A GAME IN WHICH THE YOUNG MAN WHO BRAVELY STRIKES OUT FOR HIMSELF RECEIVES NO PRAISE FOR IT BAT SENIOR PARTNER OF BAT BALL AND CO AND NEVER FOUND WITHOUT THE REST OF THE FIRM AS IT TAKES SEVERAL HIGH BALLS TO MAKE ONE SHORT BAT BEACH
LATER MISTER GRAHAM THERE IS A HACK DRIVER OUTSIDE WHO IS EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN YOU HE WANTS TO BE PAID I ASKED RAWLINS TO DRIVE ME BACK BUT HE RUSHED FROM THE COURTHOUSE PROBABLY TO TELEPHONE HIS ROTUND SUPERIOR
GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED
PERRY PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND SAVAREEN HAD RIDDEN NORTHWARD FROM THE GATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED
HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
OR HEAVEN FOR SMACKS THE YEAR AROUND BENEDICT A MARRIED MALE BENEDICTINE A MARRIED FEMALE BENEDICTION THEIR CHILDREN BERTH AN AID TO SLEEP INVENTED BY PULLMAN LOWER PREFERRED
FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
A DESIRABLE QUALITY IN THE FOURTH OF JULY ORATION BUT NOT IN THE FIREWORKS BROKE A WORD EXPRESSING THE ULTIMATE CONDITION OF ONE WHO IS TOO MUCH BENT ON SPECULATING BUM A FALLEN TOUGH BUMP A TOUGH FALL BUNCO
IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
SCRATCHED AND WITH BROKEN HANDLES THE CLOSED COLONIAL DESK THE MISERLY RAG CARPET ALL SEEMED MUTELY ASKING AS BOBBY DID
MONEY BORN OF POOR BUT DISHONEST PARENTS
AND WAS ABLE TO FIX THE TIME AT WHICH HE HAD STARTED FOR HOME HE HAD RIDDEN FROM THE DOOR OF THE PEACOCK AT ABOUT A QUARTER TO EIGHT
MIGHT HAVE MOVED SPASMODICALLY I MEAN
PUSHED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING HE TURNED GRAHAM FULLY DRESSED STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE BED THOSE MEN BOBBY ASKED WEARILY THE GRAVE DIGGERS GRAHAM ANSWERED THEY ARE GOING TO WORK IN THE OLD CEMETERY TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR SILAS BLACKBURN
A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
OVERCOAT I'VE NEARLY FROZEN DRIVING FROM SMITHTOWN BEFORE EITHER MAN COULD GROPE FOR A SUITABLE GREETING HE FACED BOBBY
MUSCULAR FILAMENTS OF THE FACIAL CAPILLARIES WHEREBY BEING DIVESTED OF THEIR ELASTICITY
IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
BOHEMIA NOT ON THE MAP A LAND FLOWING WITH CANNED MILK AND DISTILLED HONEY AND UNTROUBLED BY CONSISTENCY CONVENTION CONSCIENCE OR CASH
BIGAMY A FORM OF INSANITY IN WHICH A MAN INSISTS ON PAYING THREE BOARD BILLS INSTEAD OF TWO BILLIOUSNESS A LIVER COMPLAINT OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR PIETY BILL OF FARE A LIST OF EATABLES
I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT
THERE WAS AN IRONICAL JUSTICE IN THE CONDITION OF THE OLD CEMETERY IT HAD RECEIVED NO INTERMENT SINCE THE DEATH OF KATHERINE'S FATHER LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CEDARS SILAS BLACKBURN HAD DELIVERED IT TO THE SWIFT OBLITERATING FINGERS OF TIME
FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH DOCTOR SCOTT THE LOCAL CORONER HELD HIMSELF IN READINESS TO SUMMON A CORONER'S JURY AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE WHEN ALL THESE MEASURES PROVED UNAVAILING A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE INHABITANTS WAS CONVENED AND FUNDS WERE SUBSCRIBED TO STILL FURTHER PROSECUTE THE SEARCH
BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
SO FOR THE SECOND TIME THE LIVING MET THE DEAD AND THE LAW WATCHED HOPEFULLY
THE PANAMANIAN HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHING HE TOO WAS SOMBRELY DRESSED AND INSTEAD OF THE VIVID NECKTIE HE HAD WORN FROM THE COURTHOUSE A JET BLACK SCARF WAS PERFECTLY ARRANGED BENEATH HIS COLLAR HE LOUNGED OPPOSITE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
BOBBY LOOKED UP ISN'T THAT AN AUTOMOBILE COMING THROUGH THE WOODS HE ASKED MAYBE RAWLINS BACK FROM SMITHTOWN OR THE MINISTER THE CAR STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT THEY HEARD THE REMOTE TINKLING OF THE FRONT DOOR BELL JENKINS PASSED THROUGH
NOTHING FURTHER COULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF SEARCHING FOR THE LATTER PERSONAGE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IT WAS GETTING ON PRETTY WELL TOWARDS MORNING WHEN MISSUS SAVAREEN SOUGHT HER COUCH AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE HER SLUMBER WAS BROKEN AND DISTURBED SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK
BUT SHE WAS HAUNTED BY A DREAD THAT SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SEE HER HUSBAND ALIVE NEXT MORNING SOON AFTER DAYLIGHT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ASTIR AND THE COUNTRY ROUND WAS CAREFULLY SEARCHED FOR ANY TRACE OF THE MISSING MAN
THEN THE PARTY PROCEEDED IN A BODY TO THE MISSING MAN'S HOUSE HERE ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED THEM THE COAT WAS AT ONCE RECOGNISED BY MISSUS SAVAREEN AS BELONGING TO HER HUSBAND BUT IT WAS NOT THE COAT WORN BY HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS THERE WAS NO DOUBT WHATEVER
WHY HE SHOULD FAIL TO REFER TO BOBBY'S QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST OR TO THE OPENLY EXPRESSED ENMITY OF GRAHAM ONLY ONE THEORY PROMISED TO FIT AT ALL IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PANAMANIAN TO RETURN TO THE CEDARS
I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
THEY QUICKLY RIVALED THEIR COMPEERS OF THE OLD CONTINENT AND LIKE THEM CARRIED OFF VICTORIES BY DINT OF LAVISH EXPENDITURE IN AMMUNITION MONEY AND MEN
THEY ARE ALWAYS STRUGGLING IN EUROPE TO MAINTAIN THE PRINCIPLE OF NATIONALITIES WELL
THE CITY MAGNATES MUNICIPAL COUNCILORS AND SELECT MEN
SHOPKEEPERS AND MECHANICS SIMPLE TRADESMEN JUMPED THEIR COUNTERS TO BECOME EXTEMPORIZED CAPTAINS COLONELS AND GENERALS WITHOUT HAVING EVER PASSED THE SCHOOL OF INSTRUCTION AT WEST POINT NEVERTHELESS
THEREFORE THAN TO PERCEIVE THEM APPLYING THEIR AUDACIOUS INGENUITY TO THE SCIENCE OF GUNNERY WITNESS THE MARVELS OF PARROTT DAHLGREN AND RODMAN THE ARMSTRONG PALLISER
FROM THE GENTLEMAN LOUNGING UPON THE BARROOM SETTEE WITH HIS TUMBLER OF SHERRY COBBLER BEFORE HIM DOWN TO THE WATERMAN WHO GOT DRUNK UPON HIS KNOCK ME DOWN IN THE DINGY TAVERNS OF FELL POINT ABOUT TWO A M HOWEVER
TOGETHER WITH GRIEF AND THE GUN CLUB WAS RELEGATED TO PROFOUND INACTIVITY SOME FEW OF THE MORE ADVANCED AND INVETERATE THEORISTS SET THEMSELVES AGAIN TO WORK UPON CALCULATIONS REGARDING THE LAWS OF PROJECTILES THEY REVERTED INVARIABLY
ANTECEDENTS OF THE GUN CLUB AND IT CANNOT FAIL TO MAKE SOME NOISE IN THE WORLD A THRILL OF EXCITEMENT RAN THROUGH THE MEETING BARBICANE HAVING BY A RAPID MOVEMENT FIRMLY FIXED HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD CALMLY CONTINUED HIS HARANGUE
HE WAS PRESENTLY TORN FROM HIS SEAT AND PASSED FROM THE HANDS OF HIS FAITHFUL COLLEAGUES INTO THE ARMS OF A NO LESS EXCITED CROWD NOTHING CAN ASTOUND AN AMERICAN
THERE ON THOSE VAST PLAINS THEY WERE TO DESCRIBE ENORMOUS GEOMETRIC FIGURES DRAWN IN CHARACTERS OF REFLECTING LUMINOSITY AMONG WHICH WAS THE PROPOSITION REGARDING THE SQUARE OF THE HYPOTHENUSE COMMONLY CALLED THE ASS'S BRIDGE BY THE FRENCH
PASTED OR STUCK AND ETUDE STUDY A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE IS STUCK ON STUDY
A FEMININE VIRTUE AND A MASCULINE VICE CREMATION A MEANS OF DISPOSING OF THE DEAD LIKELY TO BECOME VERY POPULAR ESPECIALLY WITH WOMEN WHO ARE SO FOND OF HAVING THE LAST RETORT CRITIC A WET BLANKET THAT SOAKS EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES CROOK
IT IS BUT FAIR TO ADD THAT THESE YANKEES BRAVE AS THEY HAVE EVER PROVED THEMSELVES TO BE DID NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THEORIES AND FORMULAE BUT THAT THEY PAID HEAVILY IN PROPRIA PERSONA FOR THEIR INVENTIONS AMONG THEM
CALM COLD AUSTERE OF A SINGULARLY SERIOUS AND SELF CONTAINED DEMEANOR PUNCTUAL AS A CHRONOMETER OF IMPERTURBABLE TEMPER AND IMMOVABLE CHARACTER BY NO MEANS CHIVALROUS YET ADVENTUROUS WITHAL AND ALWAYS BRINGING PRACTICAL IDEAS
NEVERTHELESS I AM BOUND TO ADD THAT SOME PRACTICAL GENIUSES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ESTABLISH ACTUAL COMMUNICATION WITH HER THUS A FEW DAYS AGO A GERMAN GEOMETRICIAN PROPOSED TO SEND A SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION TO THE STEPPES OF SIBERIA
WHAT ARE YOU DREAMING OF SCREAMED BILSBY
IS THE CONVICTION THAT WE ARE SAFE TO SUCCEED IN AN ENTERPRISE WHICH TO ANY OTHER COUNTRY WOULD APPEAR WHOLLY IMPRACTICABLE THIS PROJECT THE RESULT OF LONG ELABORATION IS THE OBJECT OF MY PRESENT COMMUNICATION IT IS WORTHY OF YOURSELVES
SHEEP WITH HORNS OF IVORY A WHITE SPECIES OF DEER AND INHABITANTS WITH MEMBRANOUS WINGS LIKE BATS THIS BROCHURE THE WORK OF AN AMERICAN NAMED LOCKE HAD A GREAT SALE BUT TO BRING THIS RAPID SKETCH TO A CLOSE
WERE PICTURESQUELY INTERLACED AGAINST THE WALLS THE GAS LIT UP IN FULL GLARE MYRIADS OF REVOLVERS GROUPED IN THE FORM OF LUSTRES WHILE GROUPS OF PISTOLS AND CANDELABRA FORMED OF MUSKETS BOUND TOGETHER
GUNS WERE COMPELLED TO BOW BEFORE THEIR TRANSATLANTIC RIVALS NOW WHEN AN AMERICAN HAS AN IDEA HE DIRECTLY SEEKS A SECOND AMERICAN TO SHARE IT
SEEING IN THAT TITLE AN ALLUSION DAMAGING TO BARBICANE'S PROJECT BROKE INTO THE AUDITORIUM SMASHED THE BENCHES AND COMPELLED THE UNLUCKY DIRECTOR TO ALTER HIS PLAYBILL
GARLANDS OF HOWITZERS IN SHORT ALL THE APPARATUS OF THE ARTILLERIST ENCHANTED THE EYE BY THIS WONDERFUL ARRANGEMENT AND INDUCED A KIND OF BELIEF THAT THEIR REAL PURPOSE WAS ORNAMENTAL RATHER THAN DEADLY
FRENCH AND PRUSSIANS HAVE NOTHING TO LEARN BUT THEIR CANNON HOWITZERS AND MORTARS ARE MERE POCKET PISTOLS
COMPLETED THIS MAGNIFICENT DISPLAY OF BRILLIANCE MODELS OF CANNON BRONZE CASTINGS SIGHTS COVERED WITH DENTS PLATES BATTERED BY THE SHOTS OF THE GUN CLUB ASSORTMENTS OF RAMMERS AND SPONGES CHAPLETS OF SHELLS WREATHS OF PROJECTILES
SAID BARBICANE THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I CALL PURELY PAPER ONES
ON THAT EVENING A STRANGER WHO MIGHT HAVE CHANCED TO BE IN BALTIMORE COULD NOT HAVE GAINED ADMISSION FOR LOVE OR MONEY INTO THE GREAT HALL THAT WAS RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY FOR RESIDENT OR CORRESPONDING MEMBERS NO ONE ELSE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE OBTAINED A PLACE AND
HAVE PENETRATED THE SECRETS OF OUR SATELLITE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY A CERTAIN DAVID FABRICIUS
IN FRONT OF THE TABLE BENCHES ARRANGED IN ZIGZAG FORM LIKE THE CIRCUMVALLATIONS OF A RETRENCHMENT FORMED A SUCCESSION OF BASTIONS AND CURTAINS
AFTER THIS CONVERSATION EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION RECEIVED A SEALED CIRCULAR COUCHED IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS BALTIMORE OCTOBER THIRD THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUN CLUB HAS THE HONOR TO INFORM HIS COLLEAGUES
IT WAS DELIGHTFUL ONCE UPON A TIME ONE INVENTED A GUN AND HARDLY WAS IT CAST WHEN ONE HASTENED TO TRY IT IN THE FACE OF THE ENEMY THEN ONE RETURNED TO CAMP WITH A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT FROM SHERMAN OR A FRIENDLY SHAKE OF THE HAND FROM MC CLELLAN BUT NOW THE GENERALS ARE GONE BACK TO THEIR COUNTERS
THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND STATISTICAL SOCIETY OF NEW YORK THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF PHILADELPHIA AND THE SMITHSONIAN OF WASHINGTON SENT INNUMERABLE LETTERS OF CONGRATULATION TO THE GUN CLUB TOGETHER WITH OFFERS OF IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE AND MONEY
TO ATTEND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRESENT INVITATION VERY CORDIALLY IMPEY BARBICANE
ONE WHO COMMANDS THE COIN CONSCIENCE THE FEAR OF BEING FOUND OUT COOK A CHARITABLE INSTITUTION PROVIDING FOOD AND SHELTER FOR POLICEMEN CORPS
BAH GROWLED BILSBY BETWEEN THE FOUR TEETH WHICH THE WAR HAD LEFT HIM THAT WILL NEVER DO BY JOVE CRIED J T MASTON HE MUSTN'T COUNT ON MY VOTE AT THE NEXT ELECTION NOR ON OURS REPLIED UNANIMOUSLY ALL THE BELLICOSE INVALIDS
AND CORPS FOUND IN ARMS CORSET
THE MEANS OF ARRIVING THITHER ARE SIMPLE EASY CERTAIN INFALLIBLE AND THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF MY PRESENT PROPOSAL A STORM OF ACCLAMATIONS GREETED THESE WORDS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE WHOLE AUDIENCE WHO WAS NOT OVERCOME CARRIED AWAY
CROW A BIRD THAT NEVER COMPLAINS WITHOUT CAWS CULTURE A DEGREE OF MENTAL DEVELOPMENT THAT PRODUCES TAILOR MADE WOMEN FANTASTICALLY SHEARED POODLES AND DOCK TAILED HORSES CUPID A DRIVER OF SHARP DARTS CUPIDITY
HIGH AND LOW THE QUAYS BORDERING THE PATAPSCO THE SHIPS LYING IN THE BASINS DISGORGED A CROWD DRUNK WITH JOY GIN AND WHISKY EVERY ONE CHATTERED ARGUED DISCUSSED DISPUTED APPLAUDED
THAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN DOING NOTHING HERE RETURNED THE COLONEL QUITE SO SAID J T MATSON BUT STILL WE NEED NOT DREAM OF THAT EXPEDIENT AND WHY NOT DEMANDED THE COLONEL BECAUSE THEIR IDEAS OF PROGRESS
WHICH THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE IS CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING IT WAS A SCENE OF INDESCRIBABLE CONFUSION AND UPROAR THEY SHOUTED THEY CLAPPED THEY STAMPED ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL ALL THE WEAPONS IN THE MUSEUM DISCHARGED AT ONCE
ALL THE HETEROGENEOUS UNITS WHICH MAKE UP THE POPULATION OF MARYLAND SHOUTED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE VERNACULARS AND THE VIVAS HURRAHS AND BRAVOS WERE INTERMINGLED IN INEXPRESSIBLE ENTHUSIASM JUST AT THIS CRISIS
AND THEIR PROJECTILES EXCEEDING THE PRESCRIBED LIMITS UNFORTUNATELY OCCASIONALLY CUT IN TWO SOME UNOFFENDING PEDESTRIANS THESE INVENTIONS IN FACT LEFT FAR IN THE REAR THE TIMID INSTRUMENTS OF EUROPEAN ARTILLERY
THEY DEBATED WHETHER THE MOON WAS A FINISHED WORLD OR WHETHER IT WAS DESTINED TO UNDERGO ANY FURTHER TRANSFORMATION DID IT RESEMBLE THE EARTH AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE LATTER WAS DESTITUTE AS YET OF AN ATMOSPHERE WHAT KIND OF SPECTACLE WOULD ITS HIDDEN HEMISPHERE PRESENT TO OUR TERRESTRIAL SPHEROID
IT IS TOO TRUE REPLIED J T MASTON WITH FRESH VIOLENCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND GROUNDS FOR FIGHTING AND YET WE DON'T FIGHT WE SAVE UP OUR ARMS AND LEGS FOR THE BENEFIT OF NATIONS
THE FUTURE OF GUNNERY IN AMERICA IS LOST AY AND NO WAR IN PROSPECT CONTINUED THE FAMOUS JAMES T MASTON SCRATCHING WITH HIS STEEL HOOK HIS GUTTA PERCHA CRANIUM NOT A CLOUD ON THE HORIZON AND THAT TOO
OF ITS TIME ABOUT EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE A SMALL TREATISE TRANSLATED FROM THE NEW YORK AMERICAN RELATED HOW SIR JOHN HERSCHEL HAVING BEEN DESPATCHED TO THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING THERE SOME ASTRONOMICAL CALCULATIONS
JUST WHEN THE DEEP TONED CLOCK IN THE GREAT HALL STRUCK EIGHT BARBICANE AS IF HE HAD BEEN SET IN MOTION BY A SPRING RAISED HIMSELF UP A PROFOUND SILENCE ENSUED AND THE SPEAKER
TO EMPTY THE HEAD NOTE WOMEN WHO HAVE CAPTIVATED MEN CAPE A NECK IN THE SEA CAPER A FOOT IN THE AIR
CYRANO DE BERGERAC PUBLISHED THAT CELEBRATED
HENCE TO FILL WITH HOT AIR COMPLEXION COLOR FOR THE FACE
WERE REDUCED TO SILENCE BY THIS DISASTROUS PEACE AND GAVE THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO DREAMS OF A PLATONIC KIND OF ARTILLERY THIS IS HORRIBLE SAID TOM HUNTER ONE EVENING WHILE RAPIDLY CARBONIZING HIS WOODEN LEGS IN THE FIREPLACE OF THE SMOKING ROOM
NO TRUE YANKEE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED EVEN THE SEMBLANCE OF A DIFFICULTY TO BE POSSIBLE A THING WITH THEM IS NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE THE TRIUMPHAL PROGRESS OF THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE EVENING IT WAS A REGULAR TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION
ALL EAGER TO LEARN THE NATURE OF THE IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION OF PRESIDENT BARBICANE ALL PUSHING SQUEEZING CRUSHING WITH THAT PERFECT FREEDOM OF ACTION WHICH IS SO PECULIAR TO THE MASSES WHEN EDUCATED IN IDEAS OF SELF GOVERNMENT
BOLD IN HIS CONCEPTIONS HE CONTRIBUTED POWERFULLY TO THE PROGRESS OF THAT ARM AND GAVE AN IMMENSE IMPETUS TO EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES HE WAS PERSONAGE OF THE MIDDLE HEIGHT
NO IS IT POSSIBLE REPLIED TOM HUNTER
IT WAS QUITE INADEQUATE TO ACCOMMODATE THE CROWD OF SAVANTS THEY OVERFLOWED INTO THE ADJOINING ROOMS DOWN THE NARROW PASSAGES INTO THE OUTER COURTYARDS THERE THEY RAN AGAINST THE VULGAR HERD WHO PRESSED UP TO THE DOORS EACH STRUGGLING TO REACH THE FRONT RANKS
BARBICANE HAD MADE A LARGE FORTUNE AS A TIMBER MERCHANT BEING NOMINATED DIRECTOR OF ARTILLERY DURING THE WAR
CHAPTER TWO PRESIDENT BARBICANE'S COMMUNICATION ON THE FIFTH OF OCTOBER AT EIGHT P M A DENSE CROWD PRESSED TOWARD THE SALOONS OF THE GUN CLUB
SELENOGRAPHIC CHARTS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH A PERFECTION WHICH EQUALS IF IT DOES NOT EVEN SURPASS THAT OF OUR TERRESTRIAL MAPS PHOTOGRAPHY HAS GIVEN US PROOFS OF THE INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY OF OUR SATELLITE ALL IS KNOWN REGARDING THE MOON
THERE IS NO BOND IN EXISTENCE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND HER SATELLITE IT IS RESERVED FOR THE PRACTICAL GENIUS OF AMERICANS TO ESTABLISH A COMMUNICATION
TO TAKE OFF CARTOON THE TAKE OFF CAULIFLOWER A CABBAGE WITH A COLLEGE EDUCATION CAVALRY THAT ARM OF THE MILITARY SERVICE THAT ENGAGES IN THE REAL HOSS TILITIES CEMETERY
LIFTED OUT OF HIMSELF BY THE SPEAKER'S WORDS LONG CONTINUED APPLAUSE RESOUNDED FROM ALL SIDES AS SOON AS THE EXCITEMENT HAD PARTIALLY SUBSIDED BARBICANE RESUMED HIS SPEECH IN A SOMEWHAT GRAVER VOICE YOU KNOW SAID HE
THE ESTIMATION IN WHICH THESE GENTLEMEN WERE HELD ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE MOST SCIENTIFIC EXPONENTS OF THE GUN CLUB WAS PROPORTIONAL TO THE MASSES OF THEIR GUNS
CIVILIZATION AN UPWARD GROWTH OR TENDENCY THAT HAS ENABLED MANKIND TO DEVELOP THE COLLEGE YELL FROM WHAT WAS ONCE ONLY A FEEBLE WAR WHOOP COLLECTOR A MAN WHOM FEW CARE TO SEE BUT MANY ASK TO CALL AGAIN COLLEGE
PEOPLE HAVE EVIDENTLY BEEN DECEIVED BY THE DICTIONARY IN AMERICA ALL IS EASY ALL IS SIMPLE AND AS FOR MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES THEY ARE OVERCOME BEFORE THEY ARISE BETWEEN BARBICANE'S PROPOSITION AND ITS REALIZATION
RIDICULOUS REPLIED TOM HUNTER WHITTLING WITH HIS BOWIE KNIFE THE ARMS OF HIS EASY CHAIR BUT IF THAT BE THE CASE THERE ALL THAT IS LEFT FOR US IS TO PLANT TOBACCO AND DISTILL WHALE OIL WHAT ROARED J T MASTON
IT SPREAD EQUALLY AMONG ALL CLASSES OF CITIZENS MEN OF SCIENCE SHOPKEEPERS MERCHANTS PORTERS CHAIR MEN AS WELL AS GREENHORNS WERE STIRRED IN THEIR INNERMOST FIBRES A NATIONAL ENTERPRISE WAS AT STAKE THE WHOLE CITY
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD IMPEY BARBICANE BECAME ONE OF THE GREATEST CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES A KIND OF WASHINGTON OF SCIENCE A SINGLE TRAIT OF FEELING TAKEN FROM MANY OTHERS WILL SERVE TO SHOW THE POINT WHICH THIS HOMAGE OF A WHOLE PEOPLE
SHALL WE NOT EMPLOY THESE REMAINING YEARS OF OUR LIFE IN PERFECTING FIREARMS SHALL THERE NEVER BE A FRESH OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING THE RANGES OF PROJECTILES SHALL THE AIR NEVER AGAIN BE LIGHTED WITH THE GLARE OF OUR GUNS NO INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTY EVER ARISE
AND SIMILAR SMALL ARMS MET WITH LITTLE CONSIDERATION
THE ONE PLACE WHERE PRINCES AND PAUPERS PORTERS AND PRESIDENTS ARE FINALLY ON THE DEAD LEVEL CHAMPAGNE THE STUFF THAT MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND CHAIR FOUR LEGGED AID TO THE INJURED CHARITY FOREHANDED AID TO THE INDIGENT
PERHAPS HE WAS DESIROUS OF ADDRESSING A FEW MORE WORDS TO HIS COLLEAGUES FOR BY HIS GESTURES HE DEMANDED SILENCE AND HIS POWERFUL ALARUM WAS WORN OUT BY ITS VIOLENT REPORTS NO ATTENTION HOWEVER WAS PAID TO HIS REQUEST
ONE MIGHT SAY ALL THE WORLD WAS ON THE RAMPARTS THE PRESIDENT WAS SUFFICIENTLY WELL KNOWN HOWEVER FOR ALL TO BE ASSURED THAT HE WOULD NOT PUT HIS COLLEAGUES TO DISCOMFORT WITHOUT SOME VERY STRONG MOTIVE IMPEY BARBICANE WAS A MAN OF FORTY YEARS OF AGE
A PERFECT PIECE OF CAST IRON LACEWORK TROPHIES OF BLUNDERBUSES MATCHLOCKS ARQUEBUSES
IT WOULD BE BUT JUST AND FAIR RETURNED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY
TO JOLLY BEAUTIFULLY CALCIUM AN EARTHLY LIGHT THAT BRIGHTENS EVEN THE STARS CANNIBAL A HEATHEN HOBO WHO NEVER WORKS BUT LIVES ON OTHER PEOPLE CAPTIVATE
WERE TO BE COUNTED OFFICERS OF ALL RANKS FROM LIEUTENANTS TO GENERALS MILITARY MEN OF EVERY AGE FROM THOSE WHO WERE JUST MAKING THEIR DEBUT IN THE PROFESSION OF ARMS UP TO THOSE WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN THE GUN CARRIAGE MANY HAD FOUND
EVERY ONE MUST SEE THAT THAT INVOLVED THE COMMENCEMENT OF A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ALL MUST HOPE THAT SOME DAY AMERICA
HENCE A FIXED UP JOSH CONDUCTOR
WHICH MATHEMATICAL SCIENCE ASTRONOMY GEOLOGY
BUT THE POINT IN WHICH THE AMERICANS SINGULARLY DISTANCED THE EUROPEANS WAS IN THE SCIENCE OF GUNNERY NOT INDEED THAT THEIR WEAPONS RETAINED A HIGHER DEGREE OF PERFECTION THAN THEIRS
CADDIE A SMALL BOY EMPLOYED AT A LIBERAL STIPEND TO LOSE BALLS FOR OTHERS AND FIND THEM FOR HIMSELF CAFE
ALL HIS LIMBS COMPLETE HIS STRONGLY MARKED FEATURES SEEMED DRAWN BY SQUARE AND RULE AND IF IT BE TRUE THAT IN ORDER TO JUDGE A MAN'S CHARACTER ONE MUST LOOK AT HIS PROFILE BARBICANE SO EXAMINED EXHIBITED THE MOST CERTAIN INDICATIONS OF ENERGY
THERE IS NO ONE AMONG YOU MY BRAVE COLLEAGUES WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE MOON OR AT LEAST HEARD SPEAK OF IT DON'T BE SURPRISED IF I AM ABOUT TO DISCOURSE TO YOU REGARDING THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
CHUMP ANY ONE WHOSE OPINION DIFFERS RADICALLY FROM OURS CIGARETTE A WEED WHOSE SMOKE SOME SAY SHOULD NEVER BE INHALED AND STILL MORE INSIST SHOULD NEVER BE EXHALED CINDER ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO CATCH YOUR EYE IN TRAVELLING
TO BEAR UPON THE VERY RASHEST ENTERPRISES AN ESSENTIALLY NEW ENGLANDER
DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET TRY AN INCUBATOR CAB AFFAIR FOR A DRIVE CABBY DRIVER FOR A FARE
ALL THE PAPERS PAMPHLETS REPORTS ALL THE JOURNALS PUBLISHED BY THE SCIENTIFIC LITERARY AND RELIGIOUS SOCIETIES ENLARGED UPON ITS ADVANTAGES AND THE SOCIETY OF NATURAL HISTORY OF BOSTON THE SOCIETY OF SCIENCE AND ART OF ALBANY
OR MORE OR LESS PERFECTED A CANNON OR IN DEFAULT OF A CANNON AT LEAST A FIREARM OF SOME DESCRIPTION IT MAY HOWEVER BE MENTIONED THAT MERE INVENTORS OF REVOLVERS FIRE SHOOTING
CHAPTER THREE EFFECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMUNICATION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY THE LAST WORDS OF THE HONORABLE PRESIDENT THE CRIES THE SHOUTS THE SUCCESSION OF ROARS HURRAHS AND ALL THE VARIED VOCIFERATIONS
OF THESE LITTLE FACTS AND FELT JUSTLY PROUD WHEN THE DESPATCHES OF A BATTLE RETURNED THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS AT TEN FOLD THE QUANTITY OF PROJECTILES EXPENDED ONE DAY HOWEVER SAD AND MELANCHOLY DAY PEACE WAS SIGNED BETWEEN THE SURVIVORS OF THE WAR
NO DIRECT COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH HER A VIOLENT MOVEMENT OF INTEREST AND SURPRISE HERE GREETED THIS REMARK OF THE SPEAKER PERMIT ME HE CONTINUED TO RECOUNT TO YOU BRIEFLY HOW CERTAIN ARDENT SPIRITS STARTING ON IMAGINARY JOURNEYS
BY WHICH AT ITS FIRST TRIAL HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN KILLING THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE FACT REPLIED HE STILL WHAT IS THE USE OF SO MANY STUDIES WORKED OUT SO MANY DIFFICULTIES VANQUISHED IT'S MERE WASTE OF TIME
THE NEW WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE MADE UP ITS MIND TO LIVE IN PEACE AND OUR BELLICOSE TRIBUNE PREDICTS SOME APPROACHING CATASTROPHES ARISING OUT OF THIS SCANDALOUS INCREASE OF POPULATION NEVERTHELESS REPLIED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY
AUDACITY AND SANG FROID AT THIS MOMENT HE WAS SITTING IN HIS ARMCHAIR SILENT ABSORBED LOST IN REFLECTION SHELTERED UNDER HIS HIGH CROWNED HAT A KIND OF BLACK CYLINDER WHICH ALWAYS SEEMS FIRMLY SCREWED UPON THE HEAD OF AN AMERICAN
BUT THAT THEY EXHIBITED UNHEARD OF DIMENSIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY ATTAINED HITHERTO UNHEARD OF RANGES IN POINT OF GRAZING PLUNGING OBLIQUE OR ENFILADING OR POINT BLANK FIRING THE ENGLISH
ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION RESIDENT IN BALTIMORE ATTENDED THE INVITATION OF THEIR PRESIDENT AS REGARDS THE CORRESPONDING MEMBERS NOTICES WERE DELIVERED BY HUNDREDS THROUGHOUT THE STREETS OF THE CITY AND LARGE AS WAS THE GREAT HALL
AND THIRTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE CORRESPONDING MEMBERS ONE CONDITION WAS IMPOSED
THE NEWSPAPERS GREW MOULDY ON THE TABLES SOUNDS OF SNORING CAME FROM DARK CORNERS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB
SEE KERNEL COMPLIMENT
STEEL HOOKS CAOUTCHOUC JAWS SILVER CRANIUMS PLATINUM NOSES
WHICH MET WITH SUCH SUCCESS IN FRANCE SOMEWHAT LATER ANOTHER FRENCHMAN NAMED FONTENELLE WROTE THE PLURALITY OF WORLDS A
CONTRACTED IN A PENNSYLVANIA BLAST FURNACE
THE INHABITANTS OF THE MOON IN SIXTEEN FORTY NINE A FRENCHMAN ONE JEAN BAUDOIN PUBLISHED A JOURNEY PERFORMED FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON BY DOMINGO GONZALEZ A SPANISH ADVENTURER AT THE SAME PERIOD
CALLED HER BY ALL KINDS OF ENDEARING NAMES BETWEEN EIGHT O'CLOCK AND MIDNIGHT ONE OPTICIAN IN JONES' FALL STREET MADE HIS FORTUNE BY THE SALE OF OPERA GLASSES MIDNIGHT ARRIVED AND THE ENTHUSIASM SHOWED NO SIGNS OF DIMINUTION
THE INVENTOR OF A NEW CANNON ASSOCIATED HIMSELF WITH THE CASTER AND THE BORER THUS WAS FORMED THE NUCLEUS OF THE GUN CLUB IN A SINGLE MONTH AFTER ITS FORMATION IT NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE EFFECTIVE MEMBERS
COULD NOT HAVE MORE VIOLENTLY SET IN MOTION THE WAVES OF SOUND ONE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED AT THIS THERE ARE SOME CANNONEERS NEARLY AS NOISY AS THEIR OWN GUNS BARBICANE REMAINED CALM IN THE MIDST OF THIS ENTHUSIASTIC CLAMOR
AND THE IMPLACABLE ENEMY OF THE GENTLEMEN OF THE SOUTH THOSE ANCIENT CAVALIERS OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY
THE MEETING FELT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOW APPROACHING THE CRITICAL POINT AND REDOUBLED THEIR ATTENTION ACCORDINGLY FOR SOME MONTHS PAST MY BRAVE COLLEAGUES CONTINUED BARBICANE I HAVE BEEN ASKING MYSELF WHETHER WHILE CONFINING OURSELVES TO OUR OWN PARTICULAR OBJECTS
EVERY INTELLIGENT BEING SAID THE GEOMETRICIAN MUST UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTIFIC MEANING OF THAT FIGURE THE SELENITES DO THEY EXIST
THEIR REST ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE WHOSE NAMES FIGURED IN THE BOOK OF HONOR OF THE GUN CLUB AND OF THOSE WHO MADE GOOD THEIR RETURN THE GREATER PROPORTION BORE THE MARKS OF THEIR INDISPUTABLE VALOR CRUTCHES WOODEN LEGS ARTIFICIAL ARMS
HANG A FEW OF OUR COUNTRYMEN NO SUCH LUCK REPLIED COLONEL BLOMSBERRY NOTHING OF THE KIND IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AND EVEN IF IT DID WE SHOULD NOT PROFIT BY IT AMERICAN SUSCEPTIBILITY IS FAST DECLINING AND WE ARE ALL GOING TO THE DOGS
WHAT PROGRESS ARTILLERY SCIENCE HAS MADE DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WHAT A DEGREE OF PERFECTION FIREARMS OF EVERY KIND HAVE REACHED MOREOVER YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT IN GENERAL TERMS
THE EXCITEMENT BEGAN TO SUBSIDE PRESIDENT BARBICANE REACHED HIS HOUSE BRUISED CRUSHED AND SQUEEZED ALMOST TO A MUMMY HERCULES COULD NOT HAVE RESISTED A SIMILAR OUTBREAK OF ENTHUSIASM THE CROWD GRADUALLY DESERTED THE SQUARES AND STREETS
SHAPE AND SEC ROUGH ROUGH ON THE SHAPE COSMETIC A NEW FACE MAKER
NOTHING TO DO NOTHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT A LOATHSOME EXISTENCE WHEN AGAIN SHALL THE GUNS AROUSE US IN THE MORNING WITH THEIR DELIGHTFUL REPORTS
AS THOUGH SHE COMPREHENDED ALL THIS AGITATION REGARDING HERSELF THE MOON SHONE FORTH WITH SERENE SPLENDOR ECLIPSING BY HER INTENSE ILLUMINATION ALL THE SURROUNDING LIGHTS THE YANKEES ALL TURNED THEIR GAZE TOWARD HER RESPLENDENT ORB KISSED THEIR HANDS
OF THAT MYSTERIOUS ORB AND SOME EVEN SEEMED TO FEAR LEST ITS CONQUEST SHOULD NOT SENSIBLY DERANGE THE EQUILIBRIUM OF EUROPE THE PROJECT ONCE UNDER DISCUSSION NOT A SINGLE PARAGRAPH SUGGESTED A DOUBT OF ITS REALIZATION
THEY ELECT A PRESIDENT AND TWO SECRETARIES GIVEN FOUR THEY NAME A KEEPER OF RECORDS AND THE OFFICE IS READY FOR WORK FIVE THEY CONVENE A GENERAL MEETING AND THE CLUB IS FULLY CONSTITUTED SO THINGS WERE MANAGED IN BALTIMORE
DURING THE WAR OF THE REBELLION A NEW AND INFLUENTIAL CLUB WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE CITY OF BALTIMORE IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND IT IS WELL KNOWN WITH WHAT ENERGY THE TASTE FOR MILITARY MATTERS BECAME DEVELOPED
HER MASS DENSITY AND WEIGHT HER CONSTITUTION MOTIONS DISTANCE
A MAN WHO IS SMART ENOUGH TO OPERATE AN AUTOMOBILE BUT CLEVER ENOUGH NOT TO OWN ONE CHRISTIAN A MEMBER OF ANY ORTHODOX CHURCH CHRISTMAS A WIDELY OBSERVED HOLIDAY ON WHICH THE PAST NOR THE FUTURE IS OF SO MUCH INTEREST AS THE PRESENT
THIS FACT NEED SURPRISE NO ONE THE YANKEES THE FIRST MECHANICIANS IN THE WORLD ARE ENGINEERS JUST AS THE ITALIANS ARE MUSICIANS AND THE GERMANS METAPHYSICIANS BY RIGHT OF BIRTH NOTHING IS MORE NATURAL
AT THE FURTHER END OF THE SALOON THE PRESIDENT ASSISTED BY FOUR SECRETARIES OCCUPIED A LARGE PLATFORM HIS CHAIR SUPPORTED BY A CARVED GUN CARRIAGE WAS MODELED UPON THE PONDEROUS PROPORTIONS OF A THIRTY TWO INCH MORTAR
NEVERTHELESS THE VAST HALL PRESENTED A CURIOUS SPECTACLE ITS IMMENSE AREA WAS SINGULARLY ADAPTED TO THE PURPOSE LOFTY PILLARS FORMED OF CANNON SUPERPOSED UPON HUGE MORTARS AS A BASE SUPPORTED THE FINE IRONWORK OF THE ARCHES
MEANWHILE REPLIED J T MASTON ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT IF I CANNOT GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY MY NEW MORTARS ON A REAL FIELD OF BATTLE I SHALL SAY GOOD BY TO THE MEMBERS OF THE GUN CLUB AND GO AND BURY MYSELF IN THE PRAIRIES OF ARKANSAS
AFTER A PERIOD OF YEARS FULL OF INCIDENTS WE HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON OUR LABORS AND TO STOP SHORT ON THE ROAD OF PROGRESS I DO NOT HESITATE TO STATE BALDLY THAT ANY WAR WHICH WOULD RECALL US TO ARMS WOULD BE WELCOME TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE
FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF TIPPING THE WAITERS FOR SOMETHING TO EAT CAJOLE
AND SHUN TO AVOID TO AVOID DIFFICULTY BUY IT OF THE DRUGGIST COMMENDATION
WHAT STRIFE WHAT CLAPPER CLAWING OH THE FINE DIALOGUE FOR LUCIAN OR SAINT EVREMOND TO WRITE BETWEEN THE TWO TARTARINS
BETWIXT OUTER AND UNDER GARMENT LAY A MALAY KREESE BUT NEVER ANY POISONED ARROWS THEY ARE WEAPONS ALTOGETHER TOO UNFAIR BEFORE STARTING
AND TOOK HIM FOR REFEREE AND ARBITRATOR IN ALL THEIR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR DAILY AT COSTECALDE THE GUNSMITH'S
UNHAPPILY THEY WERE NOT THERE THE WAY BEING OPEN
CHIEFLY TO THE ACCOUNT OF THESE DIVERSE TALENTS
POOR MAN I AM SORRY FOR YOU IN EARNEST I SHALL BE QUITE SPOILED I SEE NO REMEDY THINK WHETHER IT WERE NOT BEST TO LEAVE ME AND BEGIN A NEW ADVENTURE
SOME FATHER OF THE CHURCH HAS SAID I FEEL THERE ARE TWO MEN IN ME
A MUSICAL TERM WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED HERE BECAUSE THE MUSICAL UNION MIGHT GET SORE A FLAT A PEOPLE COOP SEVEN ROOMS AND A LANDLORD WITH HOT AND COLD GAS AND RUNNING SERVANTS
PREFERRED TERRA FIRMA WE ARE AFRAID WE MUST MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT IN OUR HERO THERE WERE TWO VERY DISTINCT CHARACTERS
HE HAD NOT EVEN TAKEN THAT OBLIGATORY TRIP TO MARSEILLES
ABSOLUTE DEARTH STUPID AS THE BRUTE CREATION IS YOU CAN READILY UNDERSTAND THAT IN TIME IT LEARNT SOME DISTRUST
THE GRIZZLY OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WHO WOBBLES ON HIS HIND LEGS AND LICKS HIMSELF WITH A TONGUE FULL OF BLOOD
SWEETLY SMELLING AND WITH THE PLAY OF LIGHT ON WATERED SILK UPON ITS UNCTUOUS SURFACE AND WITH SUCCULENT GRILLED STEAK FLAVOURED WITH ANISE SEED
OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS THROUGH THE TWIGS OF HIS BAOBAB THE TEMPEST OF GREAT VOYAGES AND JOURNEYS
LASTLY
EXCEPT FOR THE PARISH LAMPS WELL SPACED APART BLINKING IN THE RIVER MIST CALM AND PROUD
PEOPLE WILL THINK ME MAD IF I GO ABROAD THIS MORNING AFTER HAVING SEEN ME IN THE CONDITION I WAS IN LAST NIGHT AND THEY WILL THINK IT STRANGE TO SEE YOU HERE
AND THE REST OF THE TIME TO LADLE OUT CASTING VOTES AT THE GUNMAKER'S
HAPPENED WHILE I WAS EXTREMELY YOUNG ONE DAY WHILE OUT IN THE BRAZILIAN DIAMOND FIELDS PICKING THE LUSCIOUS WHITE STONES FROM THE TREES IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME WHAT A FRIVOLOUS LIFE I WAS LEADING
THE MALAY PIRATE THE BRIGAND OF THE ABRUZZI IN SHORT THEY WAS WARFARE TRAVEL ADVENTURE AND GLORY BUT ALAS IT WAS TO NO AVAIL THAT THE FEARLESS TARASCONER
IN THE SILENCE AND OBSCURITY OF HIS STUDY HE EXERCISED HIMSELF FOR A WHILE WARDING OFF IMAGINARY CUTS AND THRUSTS LUNGING AT THE WALL AND GIVING HIS MUSCLES PLAY THEN HE TOOK HIS MASTER KEY
EVERY SUNDAY MORNING OUT HE WOULD MARCH IN A NEW CAP AND BACK HE WOULD STRUT EVERY SUNDAY EVENING WITH A MERE THING OF SHREDS THE LOFT OF BAOBAB VILLA
THE STEPS WOULD DRAW NEARER AND THE VOICES GROW MORE DISTINCT TILL NO MORE DOUBT WAS POSSIBLE THEY WERE COMING IN FACT HERE THEY WERE
WHEN HE WAS READING ALONE AMIDST HIS BLADES POINTS AND EDGES HOW MANY TIMES DID HE DASH DOWN HIS BOOK AND RUSH TO THE WALL TO UNHOOK A DEADLY ARM THE POOR MAN FORGOT HE WAS AT HOME IN TARASCON IN HIS UNDERCLOTHES
THE CHINESE TIGER EQUIPPING HIMSELF FOR COMBAT OR THE COMANCHE WARRIOR PAINTING UP FOR GOING ON THE WAR PATH ALL HANDS MAKE READY FOR ACTION AS THE MEN OF WAR'S MEN SAY
IN THE RIGHT HE CARRIED A SWORD CANE IN HIS LEFT POCKET A LIFE PRESERVER IN THE RIGHT A REVOLVER
I COMPLAINED BITTERLY TO HIM ABOUT SUCH AN INHUMAN INVENTION WHICH RUSHED THROUGH SPACE WITH A MAN'S EXTERIOR AND LEFT HIS INTERIOR TO BUMP ITS WAY DOWNSTAIRS
INCLUDED BEAUCAIRE AND YET THAT'S NOT FAR FROM TARASCON THERE BEING MERELY THE BRIDGE TO GO OVER UNFORTUNATELY THIS RASCALLY BRIDGE HAS SO OFTEN BEEN BLOWN AWAY BY THE GALES IT IS SO LONG AND FRAIL
WHO CARRIED IN HIS FRAME THE SOUL OF DON QUIXOTE THE SAME CHIVALRIC IMPULSES
I NEVER RESOLV'D TO GIVE YOU AN ETERNAL FAREWELL BUT I RESOLV'D AT THE SAME TIME TO PART WITH ALL THE COMFORT OF MY LIFE AND WHETHER I TOLD IT YOU OR NOT I SHALL DIE YOURS
COMMONLY CALLED THE INDEFINITE ARTICLE BECAUSE THE HIGHER THE FEWER A BAS
AND LOOK'D AS IF A LITTLE GOOD FORTUNE MIGHT MAKE US GOOD FRIENDS BUT YOUR SPECIAL FRIEND MY ELDER BROTHER I HAVE A STORY TO TELL YOU OF HIM WILL MY COUSIN F COME THINK YOU
AND JUST AS SOON AS THAT PULSE BEGAN TO JUMP AND YELL FOR SOMETHING FROM MY FIERY PEN HE WOULD THROW THE SILLY SYCLOPEDIA AT IT THEN
WITHOUT HURRYING MARK YOU COOL AND CALM BRITISH COURAGE THAT IS THE TRUE SORT GENTLEMEN AT THE GARDEN END HE OPENED THE HEAVY IRON DOOR
ONLY TWO OR THREE INVETERATE FELLOWS WORRY THEMSELVES ABOUT HIM THE REST HAVE GIVEN HIM UP AS A BAD JOB AND OLD RAPID HAS LONG AGO PASSED INTO THE LEGENDARY WORLD
AND A NAME HAS BEEN GIVEN HIM RAPID IS WHAT THEY CALL HIM
WHETHER IN AVENUES STREETS OR LANES HE TOOK CARE TO KEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AN EXCELLENT METHOD OF PRECAUTION ALLOWING ONE TO SEE DANGER COMING AND ABOVE ALL
THAT I COULD RISE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT HIS KINDLY COLLABORATION ONE DAY WHILE IN NEW YORK I WENT UP TO THE FIFTY NINTH FLOOR OF A SKY REMOVER BUILDING THE ELEVATOR WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS THAT DAY
FLOURISHED HIMSELF AND HIS TAIL IN THE TOWN MARSHES AND ENTERTAINED SHOOTING PARTIES GOT UP AGAINST HIM SO YOU SEE THE PASSION HAS LASTED A GOODISH BIT IT FOLLOWS THAT
EXTRACT FROM THEIR GAME BAGS A GOOD SIZED PIECE OF BOILED BEEF RAW ONIONS A SAUSAGE AND ANCHOVIES AND COMMENCE A NEXT TO ENDLESS SNACK WASHED DOWN WITH ONE OF THOSE NICE RHONE WINES
THEY GO OUT INTO THE REAL COUNTRY TWO OR THREE LEAGUES FROM TOWN THEY GATHER IN KNOTS OF FIVE OR SIX
WITH HIS CAP ON THE MUZZLE OF HIS GUN AND HIS FUSTIAN SHOOTING JACKET BELTED IN TIGHTLY THE STURDY RIVER LIGHTERMEN WOULD RESPECTFULLY BOB AND BLINKING TOWARDS THE HUGE BICEPS SWELLING OUT HIS ARMS
MY COLD WOULD NOT SUFFER ME BUT KEPT ME PRISONER ALL THE DAY I WENT TO YOUR LODGING TO TELL YOU THAT VISITING THE SICK WAS PART OF THE WORK OF THE DAY BUT YOU WERE GONE AND SO I WENT TO BED AGAIN
AND SOME LITTLE TO FORGET HIS CLUB AND THE MARKET PLACE IN VAIN DID HE PILE WEAPON UPON WEAPON AND MALAY KREESE UPON MALAY KREESE IN VAIN DID HE CRAM WITH ROMANCES
AND STOP SHORT AS IF TAKING ROOT ON THE SPOT SCRUTINISING THE GLOOM SNIFFING THE WIND EVEN GLUEING HIS EAR TO THE GROUND IN THE ORTHODOX RED INDIAN MODE
AND BAD DREAMS A LIQUID SUBSTANCE WHICH WHEN APPLIED TO A HOLDOVER REVIVIFIES IT AND ENABLES ITS OWNER TO SIT UP AND NOTICE THE BAR TENDER ABSTAIN
THIS LIFE IN A PETTY TOWN WEIGHED UPON HIM AND SUFFOCATED HIM THE GREAT MAN OF TARASCON WAS BORED IN TARASCON
CAN YOU ENDURE THAT WORD NO OUT UPON'T I'LL SEE YOU ANON
AND HOW I LONGED TO RISE IN THE WORLD FATHER AT ONCE TURNED ABOUT FIFTEEN VOLTS INTO HIS RIGHT SHOE AND I ROSE FOR A DISTANCE OF FOUR FEET
RINGING HIS HEELS WITH REGULARITY AND SENDING SPARKS OUT OF THE PAVING STONES
THERE ARE EVEN SOME HATTERS WHO SELL HUNTING CAPS READY SHOT TORN AND PERFORATED FOR THE BAD SHOTS BUT THE ONLY BUYER KNOWN IS THE CHEMIST BEZUQUET
WHICH SETS A TOPER LAUGHING AND SINGING AFTER THAT WHEN THOROUGHLY BRACED UP THEY RISE WHISTLE THE DOGS TO HEEL SET THE GUNS ON HALF COCK AND GO ON THE SHOOT
THE HARD WORK A MAN DOES ON THE GOLF LINKS TO GIVE HIMSELF AN APPETITE FOR SAUSAGE LINKS ANGEL SOMETHING BEHIND A SHOW AND ALWAYS SOMETHING BEHIND APE
AND YET THE PRETTY HILLOCKS ARE MIGHTILY TEMPTING SWEET SMELLING AS THEY ARE OF MYRTLE LAVENDER AND ROSEMARY AND THE FINE MUSCATELS PLUMPED OUT WITH SWEETNESS EVEN UNTO BURSTING
AND DON'T PUT ME OFF WITH A BIT OF A NOTE NOW YOU COULD WRITE ME A FINE LONG LETTER WHEN I DID NOT DESERVE IT HALF SO WELL
THE BRAVE COMMANDANT BRAVIDA HONORARY CAPTAIN RETIRED IN THE MILITARY CLOTHING FACTORY DEPARTMENT CALLED HIM A GAME FELLOW AND YOU MAY WELL ADMIT THAT THE WARRIOR KNEW ALL ABOUT GAME FELLOWS
TOLD ME IF I DID NOT LIKE IT TO GET OUT AND FLY THAT WAS THE INSPIRATION WHICH DROVE ME TO BUILD THE FLYING MACHINE
ABOVE ALL SELF CONTROL
FOR THAT IS A FACT UP TO THE AGE OF FIVE AND FORTY THE DREADLESS TARASCONIAN
AS THEY SPREAD ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RHONE ARE DEUCEDLY TEMPTING TOO TRUE TRUE BUT TARASCON LIES BEHIND ALL THIS AND TARASCON IS DOWN IN THE BLACK BOOKS OF THE WORLD OF FUR AND FEATHER
WELL MY MASTER REMEMBER LAST NIGHT YOU SWAGGERED LIKE A YOUNG LORD
PASS THE BUTTER T L THE LIMIT PREFACE SOME EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO I TOOK THIS BRILLIANT BUNCH OF BRAIN BURRS TO MY ESTEEMED PUBLISHER
ARE SOON SPOTTED AN ACCOMMODATION LIAR SOON LEARNS TO RUN LIKE AN EXPRESS A GUILTY CONSCIENCE NEEDS NO ACCUSER IF YOU CATCH HIM AT IT A AN ADJECTIVE
CONSTANTLY HOPED THAT BEYOND THE TURN OF ONE OF THESE CUT THROATS HAUNTS THEY WOULD LEAP FROM THE SHADOW AND FALL ON HIS BACK I WARRANT YOU THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WARMLY RECEIVED THOUGH
THE SIGHT OF ALL THE MURDEROUS IMPLEMENTS KEPT HIM IN A PERPETUAL STEW OF WRATH AND EXALTATION HIS REVOLVERS REPEATING RIFLES AND DUCKING GUNS SHOUTED BATTLE BATTLE
SATURDAY I CONFESS WAS DEVOTED TO MY LADY BUT YESTERDAY
WITH HIS RIDDLED CAP ON THE END OF HIS GUN BARREL AMID ANY QUANTITY OF DOG BARKS AND HORN BLASTS IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT CAP SELLING IS A FINE BUSINESS IN THE TOWN
THAT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE CLUB BY THE SHORTEST CUT HE WENT OVER THE TOWN BY THE LONGEST AND DARKEST WAY ROUND THROUGH A MASS OF VILE PALTRY ALLEYS AT THE MOUTH OF WHICH THE RHONE COULD BE SEEN OMINOUSLY GLEAMING
ARMING HIMSELF CAPA PIE TO GO TO HIS CLUB AT NINE
ALTHOUGH YOUR TARASCONER IS VERY SLIGHTLY SUPERSTITIOUS NATURALLY AND WOULD EAT COCK ROBINS ON TOAST OR THE SWALLOW WHICH IS OUR LADY'S OWN BIRD FOR THAT MATTER IF HE COULD FIND ANY BUT THAT WON'T DO
ONE THAT COULD GET THROUGH TWENTY NIGHTS WITHOUT ITS BREAST PLATE BEING UNBUCKLED OFF AND FORTY EIGHT HOURS ON A HANDFUL OF RICE ON THE CONTRARY
A MACHINE INVENTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FLYING THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS SEE M SANTOS DUMONT IN CASE HE ISN'T IN WHEN YOU CALL A PART OF HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS PRINTED HEREWITH MY FIRST YEARNING
VIOLENTLY AND ABRUPTLY SO THAT IT SHOULD SLAM AGAINST THE OUTER WALL IF THEY HAD BEEN SKULKING BEHIND IT YOU MAY WAGER THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN JAM
NOW I HAVE GOT THE TRICK OF BREAKING MY WORD I SHALL DO IT EVERY DAY I MUST GO TO ROEHAMPTON TO DAY BUT TIS ALL ONE YOU DO NOT CARE MUCH FOR SEEING ME
BUT I MET WITH A CURE FOR IT MY BROTHER KEPT ME UP TO HEAR HIS LEARNED LECTURE TILL AFTER TWO O'CLOCK AND I SPENT ALL MY ILL HUMOUR UPON HIM AND YET WE PARTED VERY QUIETLY
IT'S UP TO YOU I F M I'M FROM MISSOURI M M T S MAKE MINE THE SAME N G NICE GENTLEMAN O T L ON THE LEVEL P D Q
BUT ALACK BY REASON OF SOME NASTY MEANNESS OF DESTINY
TO IMITATE FOR INSTANCE THE MAN WHO IMITATES HIS BETTERS IS THE EASIEST MAN TO MAKE A MONKEY OF APPLAUSE THE FUSS WHICH WE THINK THE WORLD OUGHT TO MAKE OVER US
THE STEPLADDER WHICH LEADS UP TO THE WATER WAGON ABSTEMIOUS HAVING AN AISLE SEAT ON THE WATER WAGON ACROBAT A FELLOW OF INFINITE CHEST
LITTLE INDEED
JUMPED OVER THE FENCE CLIMBED A TELEGRAPH POLE BURST ITS CYLINDER HEAD EXPLODED ALL ITS TIRES AND THEN TURNED AROUND AND BARKED AT ME ABBREVIATIONS USED IN THIS WORK
BUT FINALLY WEARY OF AWAITING THEM AND CERTAIN THEY WOULD NOT SHOW THEMSELVES HE WOULD FLING A LAST GLARE OF DEFIANCE INTO THE SHADES
SIR THIS IS TO TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO MORROW MORNING ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK AT A LODGING OVER AGAINST THE PLACE WHERE CHARINGE CROSSE STOOD
ALONG THE WATERSIDE
AND HAD READ ALL THE HANDBOOKS OF ALL POSSIBLE KINDS OF VENERY FROM CAP POPPING TO BURMESE TIGER SHOOTING THE SPORTSMEN CONSTITUTED HIM THEIR GREAT CYNEGETICAL JUDGE
AND WITH MUCH ENTHUSIASM INVITED HIM TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY THEREON THE MAIN STEM IN THE WORKS INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD HIS FINGERS ON THE PUBLIC PULSE
TRUMPETER'S CHARGER WHICH FEARS NO NOISE HIS REPUTATION AS A HERO COMING FROM NOBODY KNEW WHENCE OR FOR WHAT AND SOME SCRAMBLINGS FOR COPPERS AND A FEW KICKS TO THE LITTLE RAGAMUFFINS BASKING AT HIS DOORWAY
IF I STAYED UP I KNEW I WAS SUCCESSFUL IF I CAME DOWN I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR A WEEK OR TWO THE READER WILL NOTICE A PECULIARITY ABOUT THIS GENTLEMAN'S NAME
QUICKLY GLANCING TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT ERE BANGING THE DOOR TO AND FASTENING IT SMARTLY WITH DOUBLE LOCKING THEN ON THE WAY NOT SO MUCH AS A CAT UPON THE AVIGNON ROAD
HE AT ONCE REACHED OVER AND GRABBED THE PUBLIC PULSE TO HIS ASTONISHMENT
TOGETHER WITH A HURLY BURLY OF HOUNDS CRACKING OF WHIPS AND BLOWING OF WHISTLES AND HUNTING HORNS IT'S SPLENDID TO SEE UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LACK OF GAME AN
STEADY WITH EYE AFIRE AND HEAVING BREAST
HE PLAYED SUCH A CAPITAL KNIFE AND FORK ON GAME OF ALL KINDS SO WAS THE LEGISLATURE ON TARTARIN'S SIDE TWO OR THREE TIMES IN OPEN COURT THE OLD CHIEF JUDGE
DIAMONDS DIAMONDS EVERYWHERE AND NOT A PLACE TO PAWN I BECAME RESTLESS MY FATHER OWNED THE DIAMOND PLANTATION SO I WENT TO HIM AND EXPLAINED WHAT A TIRED FEELING I HAD
ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT EVERY MAN PLUCKS OFF HIS CAP SHIES IT UP WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
WITH ALL HIS NUMBERLESS PARTS DOUBLE MUSCLES THE POPULAR FAVOUR AND THE SO PRECIOUS ESTEEM OF BRAVE COMMANDANT BRAVIDA EX CAPTAIN IN THE ARMY CLOTHING FACTORY TARTARIN WAS NOT HAPPY
FROM THE GREATEST TO THE LEAST THE CHASE IS THE LOCAL CRAZE AND SO IT HAS EVER BEEN SINCE THE MYTHOLOGICAL TIMES WHEN THE TARASQUE AS THE COUNTY DRAGON WAS CALLED
FOR DOING OUR DUTY AUTOMOBILE A HORSELESS IDEA WHICH MAKES PEOPLE GO FAST AND THE MONEY GO FASTER A TIDE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MAN WHICH TAKEN BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES AND THE CURBSTONE
AND WITH A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HIS HEAD HE WOULD TRANSLATE HIS READINGS INTO ACTION AND GOADING HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN VOICE
AND MURMURING I MEAN TO STAY AT HOME THE DUET
COULD YOU NOT STAY TILL THEY ARE ALL GONE TO ROEHAMPTON THEY GO THIS MORNING I DO BUT ASK THOUGH DO WHAT YOU PLEASE ONLY BELIEVE YOU DO A GREAT INJUSTICE IF YOU THINK ME FALSE
A B AT THE BAT
WAS A STOUT HONEST BULLY OF A BODY VERY FAT VERY WEIGHTY MOST SENSUAL AND FOND OF CODDLING HIGHLY TOUCHY FULL OF LOW CLASS APPETITE AND HOMELY REQUIREMENTS
AND PLUNGING FIERCELY INTO THE GLOOM WITH HIS CANE WAVED ON HIGH
BUT THIS SHORT FLYING TRIP MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION UPON MY MIND AND OTHERWISE TEN YEARS LATER I LEFT HOME JUST TO CONVINCE MY FATHER
SAVE ONE OLD ROGUE OF A HARE ESCAPED BY MIRACLE FROM THE MASSACRES WHO IS STUBBORNLY DETERMINED TO STICK TO IT ALL HIS LIFE HE IS VERY WELL KNOWN AT TARASCON
IN A FRENZIED EFFORT TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME MY PUBLISHER THEN YELLED FEVERISHLY FOR A PRINTER ENCLOSED PLEASE FIND THE RESULT IN THE MEANTIME HOWEVER
ALL THE DOORS CLOSED AND NO LIGHTS IN THE CASEMENTS
I AM ABED STILL AND SLEPT SO SOUNDLY NOTHING BUT YOUR LETTER COULD HAVE WAKED ME YOU SHALL HEAR FROM ME AS SOON AS WE HAVE DINED FAREWELL
FROM THE LATIN WORD ABSCONDITTO MEANING TO GRAB THE LONG GREEN AND HIKE FOR THE BAD LANDS ABSINTHE THE NATIONAL HEADACHE OF THE FRENCH A JAG BUILDER WHICH IS MOSTLY WORMWOOD
I WAS PAINED AND SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THAT MY STOMACH DID NOT TRAVEL WITH ME
ACCUMULATE TO COLLECT OR BRING TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE HE BORROWED TWO DOLLARS FROM HIS WIFE WHEREUPON HE WENT OUT AND ACCUMULATED A BUNCH OF BOOZERINE
BUT YET HE WAS EVEN THEN THE COCK OF THE WALK AT TARASCON LET US SHOW WHENCE AROSE THIS SOVEREIGNTY IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS SHOOTING MAD IN THESE PARTS
A FLUSH FOOL A MAN CAN DROP A LOT OF DOUGH TRYING TO PICK UP MONEY
UNTIL WE GET USED TO IT ALCOHOL THE FOREFATHER OF A HOLD OVER BOOZERINE IN THE RAW STATE FROM THE LATIN WORDS ALCO AND HAUL MEANING
AND TAKING HIS FINGERS OFF THE PUBLIC PULSE DON'T YOU NOAH LOTT CHESTNUT HILL
HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN THE SERPENT WAS EXTREMELY PARTIAL TO AUTUMN SO HE GAVE EVE A NICE RED APPLE AND IN EXCHANGE SHE GAVE THE SERPENT AN EARLY FALL
A FLAT IS THE POOR RELATION OF AN APARTMENT ABROAD A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE GO TO BE CURED OF VISITING FOREIGN LANDS ABSCOND TO DUCK WITH THE DOUGH
WRITES M SANTOS SEE PAGE NINETY SEVEN WAS FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO RISE IN THE WORLD WHEN BUT A LITTLE BOY MY DEAREST WISH WAS TO GET UP TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER AND THEN HAVE SOMEONE REMOVE THE LADDER
ACCORDING TO WHAT HE IS LOADED FOR THE MAN WHO LODGES MOST SHOT IN HIS CAP IS HAILED AS KING OF THE HUNT AND STALKS BACK TRIUMPHANTLY AT DUSK INTO TARASCON
ALL THAT BITES CLAWS SCALPS WHOOPS AND YELLS
HAUL HIM TO THE ALCOVE SEE LORD MACAULAY'S JAGS OF ANCIENT ROME AMBITION THE ONLY DISEASE WHICH LAZINESS CAN CURE AMUSEMENT
HAS DOUBLED AY TRIPLED THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY BUT NOBODY HAS YET MANAGED TO LAY HIM LOW AT PRESENT
IN HIS LEFT HAND
THERE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TEDIUM IN IT TO KILL HIM WITH CONSUMPTION IN VAIN DID HE SURROUND HIMSELF WITH BAOBABS AND OTHER AFRICAN TREES TO WIDEN HIS HORIZON
AND CRANKINESS FOR THE GRANDIOSE AND ROMANTIC BUT WORSE IS THE LUCK HE HAD NOT THE BODY OF THE CELEBRATED HIDALGO THAT THIN AND MEAGRE APOLOGY FOR A BODY ON WHICH MATERIAL LIFE FAILED TO TAKE A HOLD
NOW ONLY LET EM COME THEM WHO WERE THEY TARTARIN DID NOT HIMSELF ANY TOO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THEY WAS ALL THAT SHOULD BE ATTACKED AND FOUGHT WITH
I HAVE A HEART STILL THAT CANNOT RESOLVE TO REFUSE YOU ANYTHING WITHIN ITS POWER TO GRANT BUT LORD WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU
SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS WORTH OF GLORY AND ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS WORTH OF FAME TOUGH ISN'T IT I THINK MY PUBLISHER SHOULD BE CENSURED FOR GOING OUT GOLFING
IN THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS BIRDS THE WANT OF ALL MOTION IS AN OBVIOUS CAUSE OF DIMINISHED WASTE IN THE ORGANISED PARTS HENCE MILK IS NOT PROVIDED FOR THEM THE NUTRITIVE PROCESS IN THE CARNIVORA THUS PRESENTS ITSELF UNDER TWO DISTINCT FORMS
FAT PECTINE STARCH BASSORINE GUM WINE CANE SUGAR BEER GRAPE SUGAR SPIRITS SUGAR OF MILK
AND SINCE THESE LAST ARE EXACTLY REPLACED BY THE FOOD TO THE CARBON NITROGEN AND HYDROGEN OF THE FOOD WERE THIS NOT THE CASE THE WEIGHT OF THE ANIMAL COULD NOT POSSIBLY REMAIN UNCHANGED
BUT SINCE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED PARTS GOES ON MORE SLOWLY THERE WOULD ENSUE A DEFICIENCY OF THOSE SUBSTANCES
INTO NITROGENISED AND NON NITROGENISED THE FORMER ARE CAPABLE OF CONVERSION INTO BLOOD THE LATTER ARE INCAPABLE OF THIS TRANSFORMATION
BRITTLENESS IN THE BONES OF GRAMINIVOROUS ANIMALS IS CLEARLY OWING TO A WEAKNESS IN THOSE PARTS OF THE ORGANISM WHOSE FUNCTION IT IS TO CONVERT THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD INTO CELLULAR TISSUE AND MEMBRANE
THE PRECEDING CONSIDERATIONS LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH NATURE HAS ADDED TO THE FOOD OF THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS MAMMALIA SUBSTANCES DEVOID OF NITROGEN
THERE IS ADDED THEREFORE BY MEANS OF THESE COMPOUNDS TO THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF FOOD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CARBON OR AS IN THE CASE OF BUTTER OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN THAT IS AN EXCESS OF ELEMENTS
AND THE LIMBS OF THE DEAD BODY THEIR CONNECTIONS WHICH DEPEND ON THE GELATINOUS TISSUES ON THE OTHER HAND WE SEE THAT THE GELATINE OF BONES DEVOURED BY A DOG ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS
WERE NOT ABOUT TO HAPPEN INSTEAD OF OUR SUPPOSING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD COME TO PASS YET THERE WAS NO NECESSITY INVOLVED IN THEIR OWN NATURE COMPELLING THEIR OCCURRENCE
AND WOULD NECESSARILY YIELD TO THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN WERE NOT THE DEFICIENCY OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN SUPPLIED FROM ANOTHER SOURCE THE CONTINUED INCREASE OF MASS OR GROWTH
NOR CAN IMAGINATION BEHOLD UNIVERSAL IDEAS NOR THOUGHT EMBRACE PURE FORM BUT INTELLIGENCE LOOKING DOWN AS IT WERE FROM ITS HIGHER STANDPOINT IN ITS INTUITION OF FORM DISCRIMINATES ALSO THE SEVERAL ELEMENTS WHICH UNDERLIE IT
MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CHANGE AND MUST HAVE SERVED SOME PURPOSE IN THE ANIMAL ECONOMY IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GELATINE MUST BE EXPELLED FROM THE BODY IN A FORM DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN WHICH IT WAS INTRODUCED AS FOOD
LET ME NOW APPLY THE PRINCIPLES ANNOUNCED IN THE PRECEDING LETTERS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR OWN SPECIES MAN WHEN CONFINED TO ANIMAL FOOD
AND TO SEE WHAT FOLLOWS WE ASSUME THAT THERE IS NO FOREKNOWLEDGE ARE WILLED ACTIONS THEN TIED DOWN TO ANY NECESSITY IN THIS CASE CERTAINLY NOT
AND FOR THEIR GROWTH AND WHEN THE POWERS OF NUTRITION IN THE WHOLE BODY ARE AFFECTED BY A CHANGE OF THE HEALTH THEN
THE ROUNDNESS OF A BODY IS RECOGNISED IN ONE WAY BY SIGHT IN ANOTHER BY TOUCH SIGHT LOOKS UPON IT FROM A DISTANCE AS A WHOLE BY A SIMULTANEOUS REFLECTION OF RAYS TOUCH GRASPS THE ROUNDNESS PIECEMEAL
WHICH THESE ANIMALS CONSUME IN THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF THEIR FOOD WHICH BEARS NO PROPORTION WHATEVER TO THE OXYGEN ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN AND LUNGS A HORSE FOR EXAMPLE
I INQUIRE INTO THE REASONS WHY THOU ART DISSATISFIED WITH THE SOLUTION PROPOSED WHICH IS TO THE EFFECT THAT
EVEN MORE WIDELY EXTENDED THAN THE LION AND TIGER BECAUSE WHEN HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY HE KILLS WITHOUT EATING A NATION OF HUNTERS
AND THE FREE AND UNIMPEDED DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS IN THE YOUNG ANIMAL ARE DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN SUBSTANCES WHICH IN THE NUTRITIVE PROCESS HAVE NO OTHER FUNCTION THAN TO PROTECT THE NEWLY FORMED ORGANS FROM THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN
THIS IS THE VERY MIST OF OPINION NOT THE TRUTH OF KNOWLEDGE
THE GRAMINIVORA CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE SUBSTANCES THEIR FOOD MUST CONTAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ONE OR MORE OF THEM AND IF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE NOT SUPPLIED DEATH QUICKLY ENSUES
AND WHILE THE SAVAGE WITH ONE ANIMAL
WHICH IS FORMED FROM THE BLOOD OF THE MOTHER AND EMPLOYED IN YIELDING THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL THE YOUNG ANIMAL THEREFORE RECEIVES IN THE FORM OF CASEINE
NATURAL AND EASILY EXPLAINED ON ACCOUNT OF THIS VERY IDENTITY OF COMPOSITION
AND IF WE CAN TRUST TO THE REPORTS OF PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE RESIDED IN THE EAST
CONFINED TO AN ANIMAL DIET IT IS THE CARBON OF THE FLESH AND OF THE BLOOD WHICH MUST TAKE THE PLACE OF STARCH AND SUGAR
OF WHICH ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER CAN LIVE ON THE SPACE SUPPOSED THESE ANIMALS COLLECT FROM PLANTS THE CONSTITUENTS OF THEIR ORGANS AND OF THEIR BLOOD AND YIELD THEM IN TURN TO THE SAVAGES WHO LIVE BY THE CHASE ALONE
BUT IT COMPREHENDS THEM IN THE SAME WAY AS IT COMPREHENDS THAT FORM ITSELF WHICH COULD BE COGNIZED BY NO OTHER THAN ITSELF
IS FORCED TO MAKE THE MOST LABORIOUS EXERTIONS AND GO THROUGH A VAST AMOUNT OF MUSCULAR EXERCISE HE IS COMPELLED TO CONSUME FORCE MERELY IN ORDER TO SUPPLY MATTER FOR RESPIRATION CULTIVATION IS THE ECONOMY OF FORCE
IF THIS BE NOT DONE A PERIOD IS RAPIDLY PUT TO THE FORMATION OF BLOOD AND CONSEQUENTLY TO LIFE THIS CONSIDERATION ENABLES US EASILY TO EXPLAIN HOW IT HAPPENS
ALREADY CONTAIN EXACTLY THE AMOUNT OF CARBON WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN
GRASPS EACH WHOLE THAT SENSE PRESENTS OR BREAKS INTO ELEMENTS SO DIVIDES AND RECOMBINES AND IN CHANGEFUL WISE NOW TO LOW DESCENDS AND NOW TO THE HEIGHT DOTH RISE
MAN IS A TWO LEGGED ANIMAL ENDOWED WITH REASON THIS IS INDEED A UNIVERSAL NOTION YET NO ONE IS IGNORANT THAT THE THING IS IMAGINABLE AND PRESENTABLE TO SENSE BECAUSE THOUGHT CONSIDERS IT NOT BY IMAGINATION OR SENSE
WHEN CONFINED TO ANIMAL FOOD RESPIRES LIKE THE CARNIVORA AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MATTERS PRODUCED BY THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED TISSUES AND
WHICH NEITHER GAINS NOR LOSES WEIGHT PERCEPTIBLY FROM DAY TO DAY ITS NOURISHMENT THE WASTE OF ORGANISED TISSUE AND ITS CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN STAND TO EACH OTHER IN A WELL DEFINED AND FIXED RELATION THE CARBON OF THE CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OFF WITH THAT OF THE URINE
COMES A DOCTRINE SAGE THAT DOTH LIKEN LIVING MIND TO A WRITTEN PAGE SINCE ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES THROUGH SENSE GRAVEN BY EXPERIENCE AS SAY THEY THE PEN ITS MARKS CURIOUSLY DOTH TRACE
BY CONTACT AND ATTACHMENT TO THE SURFACE AND BY ACTUAL MOVEMENT ROUND THE PERIPHERY ITSELF MAN HIMSELF LIKEWISE IS VIEWED IN ONE WAY BY SENSE IN ANOTHER BY IMAGINATION IN ANOTHER WAY AGAIN BY THOUGHT
A PROGRESSIVE ALTERATION A PART OF THESE TISSUES IS SEPARATED AND MUST BE RESTORED FROM THE BLOOD BUT THIS ALTERATION AND RESTORATION ARE OBVIOUSLY CONFINED WITHIN VERY NARROW LIMITS
LET US ASSUME FOREKNOWLEDGE AGAIN BUT WITHOUT ITS INVOLVING ANY ACTUAL NECESSITY THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL I IMAGINE WILL REMAIN IN COMPLETE INTEGRITY BUT
NOW THE CIRCULATION IN THE YOUNG ANIMAL IS NOT WEAKER BUT ON THE CONTRARY MORE RAPID THE RESPIRATIONS ARE MORE FREQUENT AND FOR EQUAL BULKS THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN MUST BE GREATER RATHER THAN SMALLER IN THE YOUNG THAN IN THE ADULT ANIMAL
MORE INTENSE THAN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION IN THE EXISTING TISSUES IF BOTH PROCESSES WERE EQUALLY ACTIVE THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY COULD NOT INCREASE AND WERE THE WASTE BY TRANSFORMATION GREATER THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY WOULD DECREASE
BUT SURVEYING ALL THINGS SO TO SPEAK UNDER THE ASPECT OF PURE FORM BY A SINGLE FLASH OF INTUITION THOUGHT ALSO
THE ELEMENTS OF THESE SUBSTANCES UNITE WITH THE OXYGEN THE ORGANS THEMSELVES COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT BEING CONSUMED THAT IS GROWTH OR INCREASE OF MASS IN THE BODY THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN REMAINING THE SAME WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE
THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH WE SEE TAKING PLACE BEFORE OUR EYES THE MOVEMENTS OF CHARIOTEERS FOR INSTANCE IN GUIDING AND TURNING THEIR CARS AND SO ON NOW IS ANY ONE OF THESE MOVEMENTS COMPELLED BY ANY NECESSITY NO CERTAINLY NOT
IN ANOTHER BY PURE INTELLIGENCE SENSE JUDGES FIGURE CLOTHED IN MATERIAL SUBSTANCE IMAGINATION FIGURE ALONE WITHOUT MATTER THOUGHT TRANSCENDS THIS AGAIN
BECAUSE IN THE CARNIVORA NATURE HAS DESTINED THE NEW COMPOUNDS PRODUCED BY THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED PARTS TO FURNISH THE NECESSARY RESISTANCE TO THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN AND TO PRODUCE ANIMAL HEAT
HYAENA IN THE CAGES OF A MENAGERIE ARE COMPELLED TO ACCELERATE THE WASTE OF THE ORGANISED TISSUES BY INCESSANT MOTION IN ORDER TO FURNISH THE MATTER NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION SO THE SAVAGE FOR THE VERY SAME OBJECT
SUGAR OF MILK HAS A COMPOSITION CLOSELY ALLIED TO THAT OF THE OTHER KINDS OF SUGAR OF STARCH AND OF GUM ALL OF THEM CONTAIN CARBON AND THE ELEMENTS OF WATER THE LATTER PRECISELY IN THE PROPORTION TO FORM WATER
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IN THE SYSTEM OF THE GRAMINIVORA WHOSE FOOD CONTAINS SO SMALL A PORTION RELATIVELY OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD THE PROCESS OF METAMORPHOSIS IN EXISTING TISSUES AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR RESTORATION OR REPRODUCTION
THEN SAID SHE THIS DEBATE ABOUT PROVIDENCE IS AN OLD ONE AND IS VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSED BY CICERO IN HIS DIVINATION THOU ALSO HAST LONG AND EARNESTLY PONDERED THE PROBLEM
YET NO ONE HAS HAD DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE ENOUGH TO FIND A SOLUTION AND THE REASON OF THIS OBSCURITY IS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF HUMAN REASONING CANNOT COPE
HAVE A COMPOSITION IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD NO NITROGENISED COMPOUND THE COMPOSITION OF WHICH DIFFERS FROM THAT OF FIBRINE ALBUMEN AND CASEINE
THEY AGAIN RECEIVE THIS FOOD UNACCOMPANIED BY THOSE COMPOUNDS DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN WHICH DURING THE LIFE OF THE ANIMALS SERVED TO SUPPORT THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN SUCH MEN
THERE WOULD BE NO EFFICACY IN SKILL IF ALL MOTIONS TOOK PLACE PERFORCE THEN THINGS WHICH IN TAKING PLACE ARE FREE FROM ANY NECESSITY AS TO THEIR BEING IN THE PRESENT MUST ALSO BEFORE THEY TAKE PLACE BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN WITHOUT NECESSITY
MUST BE DRAWN NOT FROM SIGNS AND LOOSE GENERAL ARGUMENTS BUT FROM SUITABLE AND NECESSARY CAUSES BUT HOW CAN IT BE THAT THINGS FORESEEN SHOULD EVER FAIL TO COME TO PASS
THEIR EXISTENCE DEPENDS ON A SUPPLY OF SUBSTANCES HAVING A COMPOSITION IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF SUGAR OF MILK OR CLOSELY RESEMBLING IT EVERYTHING THAT THEY CONSUME AS FOOD CONTAINS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF STARCH GUM OR SUGAR MIXED WITH OTHER MATTERS
IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ELEMENTS OF GELATINE OR OF THOSE TISSUES WHICH CONTAIN IT THE GELATINOUS TISSUES THE GELATINE OF THE BONES THE MEMBRANES THE CELLS AND THE SKIN SUFFER IN THE ANIMAL BODY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OXYGEN AND MOISTURE
WHICH ARE ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION AND RESPIRATION IN THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE GRAIN AND OTHER NUTRITIOUS VEGETABLES YIELD US NOT ONLY IN STARCH SUGAR AND GUM THE CARBON WHICH PROTECTS OUR ORGANS FROM THE ACTION OF OXYGEN
WHICH THEIR ORGANISM CANNOT EMPLOY FOR NUTRITION STRICTLY SO CALLED THAT IS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BLOOD SUBSTANCES WHICH MAY BE ENTIRELY DISPENSED WITH IN THEIR NOURISHMENT IN THE ADULT STATE
SERVE TO SUPPORT THE PROCESS OF RESPIRATION THE FORMER MAY BE CALLED THE PLASTIC ELEMENTS OF NUTRITION THE LATTER ELEMENTS OF RESPIRATION AMONG THE FORMER WE RECKON
THE MATERIALS OF THE METAMORPHOSED PARTS ARE GIVEN OFF IN THE FORM OF URINE OF CARBONIC ACID AND OF WATER BUT THE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK ALSO DISAPPEAR THEY CANNOT BE DETECTED IN THE FAECES THE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK ARE GIVEN OUT IN THE FORM OF CARBONIC ACID AND WATER
WITHOUT GOING FURTHER INTO THE CALCULATION IT WILL READILY BE ADMITTED
IS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE VITAL PROCESS IN ANIMALS THE ANIMAL ORGANISM UNQUESTIONABLY POSSESSES THE POWER OF FORMING FROM THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD
WHEREAS THE CASE IS THE VERY REVERSE ALL THAT IS KNOWN IS GRASPED NOT CONFORMABLY TO ITS OWN EFFICACY BUT RATHER CONFORMABLY TO THE FACULTY OF THE KNOWER
OTHERWISE IF THERE IS NO SUCH UNIVERSAL NECESSITY NEITHER CAN ANY PRECONCEPTION BE A SIGN OF A NECESSITY WHICH EXISTS NOT
IF WE NOW CALCULATE
NAY MORE A COMPARISON OF ITS PROPERTIES WITH THOSE OF VEGETABLE CASEINE HAS SHOWN THAT THESE TWO SUBSTANCES ARE IDENTICAL IN ALL THEIR PROPERTIES INSOMUCH THAT CERTAIN PLANTS SUCH AS PEAS BEANS AND LENTILS ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE SAME SUBSTANCE
SUCH THINGS HOWEVER MUCH FOREKNOWN ARE IN THEIR OCCURRENCE FREE
THAT GELATINE WHEN TAKEN IN THE DISSOLVED STATE IS AGAIN CONVERTED IN THE BODY INTO CELLULAR TISSUE MEMBRANE AND CARTILAGE
BUT THIS THOU WILT SAY IS THE VERY POINT IN DISPUTE WHETHER ANY FOREKNOWING IS POSSIBLE OF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS NOT NECESSARY FOR HERE THERE SEEMS TO THEE A CONTRADICTION AND IF THEY ARE FORESEEN THEIR NECESSITY FOLLOWS
FOREKNOWLEDGE IS NOT TO BE DEEMED ANY HINDRANCE TO THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL NOW SURELY THE SOLE GROUND ON WHICH THOU ARGUEST THE NECESSITY OF THE FUTURE IS THAT THINGS WHICH ARE FOREKNOWN CANNOT FAIL TO COME TO PASS BUT IF
MY DEAR SIR THE FACTS DETAILED IN MY LAST LETTER WILL SATISFY YOU AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE INCREASE OF MASS IN AN ANIMAL THAT IS ITS GROWTH IS ACCOMPLISHED
THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL ITS MUSCULAR FIBRE CELLULAR TISSUE NERVOUS MATTER AND BONES MUST HAVE DERIVED THEIR ORIGIN FROM THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT OF MILK THE CASEINE FOR BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO NITROGEN
WHEN CHEMICALLY EXAMINED CASEINE IS FOUND TO CONTAIN A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF THE EARTH OF BONES THAN BLOOD DOES AND THAT IN A VERY SOLUBLE FORM CAPABLE OF REACHING EVERY PART OF THE BODY THUS EVEN IN THE EARLIEST PERIOD OF ITS LIFE
THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN CONSUMED AND AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE THE AMOUNT OF CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OUT BY THE ANIMAL ARE MUCH GREATER THAN IN THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN MAN BUT AN ADULT MAN CONSUMES DAILY ABUT FOURTEEN OZ OF CARBON
NOW THE ANALYSIS OF CASEINE HAS LED TO THE RESULT WHICH AFTER THE DETAILS I HAVE GIVEN CAN HARDLY EXCITE YOUR SURPRISE THAT THIS SUBSTANCE ALSO IS IDENTICAL IN COMPOSITION WITH THE CHIEF CONSTITUENTS OF BLOOD FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN
THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A FLUID WHICH THE BODY OF THE MOTHER SECRETES IN THE SHAPE OF MILK MILK CONTAINS ONLY ONE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT KNOWN UNDER THE NAME OF CASEINE BESIDES THIS ITS CHIEF INGREDIENTS ARE BUTTER
EMBRACES IMAGES AND SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT RESORTING TO IMAGINATION OR SENSE
VEGETABLE FIBRINE VEGETABLE ALBUMEN VEGETABLE CASEINE ANIMAL FLESH ANIMAL BLOOD AMONG THE ELEMENTS OF RESPIRATION IN OUR FOOD ARE
THAN THE FACULTY OF THE THINGS WHICH THEY COGNIZE NOR IS THIS STRANGE FOR SINCE EVERY JUDGMENT IS THE ACT OF THE JUDGE IT IS NECESSARY THAT EACH SHOULD ACCOMPLISH ITS TASK BY ITS OWN NOT BY ANOTHER'S POWER
STIRS THE SOUL'S INTELLIGENCE WHEN LIGHT FLASHES ON THE EYE OR SOUND STRIKES THE EAR MIND AROUSED TO DUE RESPONSE MAKES THE MESSAGE CLEAR
WHICH CANNOT POSSIBLY BE EMPLOYED IN THE PRODUCTION OF BLOOD
HE WOULD BE COMPELLED IF CONFINED TO FLESH ALONE IN ORDER TO PROCURE THE CARBON NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION DURING THE SAME TIME TO CONSUME FIVE SUCH ANIMALS IT IS EASY TO SEE FROM THESE CONSIDERATIONS
WHEN WE CONSIDER THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ALBUMEN OF THE BLOOD INTO A PART OF AN ORGAN COMPOSED OF FIBRINE THE IDENTITY IN COMPOSITION OF THE TWO SUBSTANCES RENDERS THE CHANGE EASILY CONCEIVABLE INDEED
THE EYE OF INTELLIGENCE IS YET MORE EXALTED
IF IT BUT REFLECT AGAIN LIKE A GLASS THINGS FALSE AND VAIN
THOU BELIEVEST TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SOUNDNESS OF KNOWLEDGE NOW THE CAUSE OF THE MISTAKE IS THIS THAT MEN THINK THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS COGNIZED PURELY BY THE NATURE AND EFFICACY OF THE THING KNOWN
THE HORSE RECEIVES RATHER LESS THAN THE FIFTH PART OF THE CARBON WHICH HIS ORGANISM REQUIRES FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS AND WE SEE THAT THE WISDOM OF THE CREATOR HAS ADDED TO HIS FOOD THE FOUR FIFTHS WHICH ARE WANTING
NO PART OF EITHER OF WHICH CAN YIELD BLOOD FIBRINE OR ALBUMEN ARE DESTINED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS AT AN AGE WHEN A GREATER RESISTANCE IS OPPOSED TO THE METAMORPHOSIS OF EXISTING ORGANISMS OR IN OTHER WORDS TO THE PRODUCTION OF COMPOUNDS WHICH
LAST IN INWARD SWIFT REVIEW STRICTLY SIFTS THE FALSE AND TRUE OF THESE AMPLE POTENCIES FITTER CAUSE I WEEN WERE MIND'S SELF THAN MARKS IMPRESSED BY THE OUTER SCENE YET THE BODY THROUGH THE SENSE
WHEREFORE THERE ARE THINGS WHICH WILL COME TO PASS THE OCCURRENCE OF WHICH IS PERFECTLY FREE FROM NECESSITY AT ALL EVENTS I IMAGINE THAT NO ONE WILL DENY THAT THINGS NOW TAKING PLACE WERE ABOUT TO COME TO PASS BEFORE THEY WERE ACTUALLY HAPPENING
HOW CLOSE THE CONNECTION IS BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES THE CULTIVATION OF OUR CROPS HAS ULTIMATELY NO OTHER OBJECT THAN THE PRODUCTION OF A MAXIMUM OF THOSE SUBSTANCES
WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED FROM FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN BY ITS GREAT SOLUBILITY AND BY NOT COAGULATING WHEN HEATED THE CHIEF CONSTITUENT OF THE MOTHER'S BLOOD TO CONVERT CASEINE INTO BLOOD NO FOREIGN SUBSTANCE IS REQUIRED AND IN THE CONVERSION OF THE MOTHER'S BLOOD INTO CASEINE
ON A LIMITED SPACE IS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF INCREASING ITS NUMBERS BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT WHICH IS SOON ATTAINED THE CARBON NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION MUST BE OBTAINED FROM THE ANIMALS
OUT OF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE ADAPTED TO THE FORMATION OF BLOOD ARE FORMED ALL THE ORGANISED TISSUES THE OTHER CLASS OF SUBSTANCES IN THE NORMAL STATE OF HEALTH
ON THE SMOOTH UNSULLIED WHITE OF THE PAPER'S FACE SO DO OUTER THINGS IMPRESS IMAGES ON CONSCIOUSNESS BUT IF VERILY THE MIND THUS ALL PASSIVE LIES IF NO LIVING POWER WITHIN ITS OWN FORCE SUPPLIES
OF THE NERVES AND BRAIN AND OF THE ORGANIC PART OF CARTILAGES AND BONES BUT THE BLOOD MUST BE SUPPLIED TO IT PERFECT IN EVERYTHING BUT ITS FORM THAT IS IN ITS CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
GRANTED BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN NO FOREKNOWLEDGE
THE NITROGEN OF THE URINE AND THE HYDROGEN GIVEN OFF AS AMMONIA AND WATER THESE ELEMENTS TAKEN TOGETHER MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL IN WEIGHT TO THE CARBON NITROGEN AND HYDROGEN OF THE METAMORPHOSED TISSUES
THAT THE TISSUES YIELDING GELATINE OR CHONDRINE AS FOR EXAMPLE THE GELATINE OF SKIN OR OF BONES ARE NOT ADAPTED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE VITAL PROCESS FOR THEIR COMPOSITION IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF FIBRINE OR ALBUMEN
BUT BY MEANS OF RATIONAL CONCEPTION
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS IN WHICH VITALITY RESIDES IS IN THE CARNIVOROUS ANIMAL DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A SUBSTANCE
THE FUNCTION PERFORMED IN THE ANIMAL SYSTEM BY SUBSTANCES DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN
WHEREAS IF THERE IS NO NECESSITY THEY CAN BY NO MEANS BE FOREKNOWN AND THOU THINKEST THAT NOTHING CAN BE GRASPED AS KNOWN UNLESS IT IS CERTAIN BUT IF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS UNCERTAIN ARE FOREKNOWN AS CERTAIN
GIVEN IN A FORM ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION THEY SERVE TO HUSBAND THE VITAL FORCE JUST AS MAY BE DONE IN THE CASE OF THE STOMACH BY DUE PREPARATION OF THE FOOD IN GENERAL
THE FUNCTION PERFORMED IN THE VITAL PROCESS OF THE GRAMINIVORA BY THESE SUBSTANCES IS INDICATED IN A VERY CLEAR AND CONVINCING MANNER WHEN WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE VERY SMALL RELATIVE AMOUNT OF THE CARBON
THE MOST RECENT AND EXACT RESEARCHES HAVE ESTABLISHED AS A UNIVERSAL FACT TO WHICH NOTHING YET KNOWN IS OPPOSED THAT THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF VEGETABLE FOOD
MUST BE DIMINISHED AS WELL IN THE STOMACH AS IN ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY IN THIS CONDITION THE UNIFORM EXPERIENCE OF PRACTICAL PHYSICIANS SHOWS THAT GELATINOUS MATTERS IN A DISSOLVED STATE EXERCISE A MOST DECIDED INFLUENCE ON THE STATE OF THE HEALTH
MUCH LESS CARBON AND HYDROGEN IN THE FORM ADAPTED FOR THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS THAN CORRESPOND TO THE OXYGEN TAKEN UP IN THE LUNGS
WHILE IN THE BODY OF A STARVING OR SICK INDIVIDUAL THE FAT DISAPPEARS AND THE MUSCULAR TISSUE TAKES ONCE MORE THE FORM OF BLOOD WE FIND THAT THE TENDONS AND MEMBRANES RETAIN THEIR NATURAL CONDITION
AND THEIR CONVERSION INTO OXIDISED PRODUCTS FURNISHES THE CLEAREST PROOF THAT FAR MORE OXYGEN IS ABSORBED THAN IS REQUIRED TO CONVERT THE CARBON AND HYDROGEN OF THE METAMORPHOSED TISSUES INTO CARBONIC ACID AND WATER
MUST GO ON FAR LESS RAPIDLY THAN IN THE CARNIVORA WERE THIS NOT THE CASE A VEGETATION A THOUSAND TIMES MORE LUXURIANT THAN THE ACTUAL ONE WOULD NOT SUFFICE FOR THEIR NOURISHMENT SUGAR GUM AND STARCH WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT LIFE IN THESE ANIMALS
ACCORDING TO WHICH A HORSE EXPIRES SEVENTY NINE OZ DAILY CANNOT BE VERY FAR FROM THE TRUTH
THE ORGANIC FORCE BY WHICH THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD ARE TRANSFORMED INTO CELLULAR TISSUE AND MEMBRANES MUST NECESSARILY BE ENFEEBLED BY SICKNESS IN THE SICK MAN THE INTENSITY OF THE VITAL FORCE ITS POWER TO PRODUCE METAMORPHOSES
IN THE ADULT STATE ARE PRODUCED IN QUANTITY AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESPIRATION THE YOUNG ANIMAL RECEIVES THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD IN THE CASEINE OF THE MILK A METAMORPHOSIS OF EXISTING ORGANS GOES ON FOR BILE AND URINE ARE SECRETED
BUT ALONG WITH THIS NITROGEN
IS FOUNDED UPON THE SENSES NEVERTHELESS SURVEYS SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT CALLING IN SENSE NOT IN THE WAY OF SENSE PERCEPTION BUT OF IMAGINATION
AND PRODUCES IN THE ORGANISM THE HEAT WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE BUT ALSO IN THE FORM OF VEGETABLE FIBRINE ALBUMEN AND CASEINE OUR BLOOD FROM WHICH THE OTHER PARTS OF OUR BODY ARE DEVELOPED MAN
IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SAVAGE STATE OR OF THE WANT OF KNOWLEDGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT I HAVE ALREADY STATED YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT THE SUBSTANCES OF WHICH THE FOOD OF MAN IS COMPOSED MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES
BY THE PURE FORCE OF THE MIND'S VISION WHEREIN THE MAIN POINT TO BE CONSIDERED IS THIS THE HIGHER FACULTY OF COMPREHENSION EMBRACES THE LOWER WHILE THE LOWER CANNOT RISE TO THE HIGHER FOR SENSE HAS NO EFFICACY BEYOND MATTER
THIS IMPORTANT INQUIRY EXTENDS ALSO TO THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE FOOD OF CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS IN THE EARLIEST PERIODS OF LIFE FOR THIS FOOD ALSO CONTAINS SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN THE ADULT STATE
FOR A SIGN ONLY INDICATES SOMETHING WHICH IS DOES NOT BRING TO PASS THAT OF WHICH IT IS THE SIGN WE REQUIRE TO SHOW BEFOREHAND THAT ALL THINGS WITHOUT EXCEPTION HAPPEN OF NECESSITY
AS THOU WERT READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE JUST NOW THE FACT OF FOREKNOWLEDGE IMPOSES NO NECESSITY ON THINGS FUTURE WHAT REASON IS THERE FOR SUPPOSING THE RESULTS OF VOLUNTARY ACTION CONSTRAINED TO A FIXED ISSUE SUPPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT
WHAT THEN IS THE USE OF THE BUTTER AND THE SUGAR OF MILK HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT THESE SUBSTANCES ARE INDISPENSABLE TO LIFE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO FIXED BASES NO SODA NOR POTASH
AND WITH GIVEN MEANS TO PRODUCE A MAXIMUM OF FORCE THE UNPROFITABLE EXERTION OF POWER THE WASTE OF FORCE IN AGRICULTURE IN OTHER BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY IN SCIENCE OR IN SOCIAL ECONOMY
CURDIE WITH THE POINT OF HIS HUNTING KNIFE KEEPING HER FROM CLASPING HER MIGHTY ARMS ABOUT HIM AS HE WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING ONCE MORE A GOOD STAMP AT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT BUT THE QUEEN WAS MORE WARY AS WELL AS MORE AGILE THAN HITHERTO
HE TOOK THE UNCEREMONIOUS LEAVE OF AN OLD FRIEND IN A FEW HOURS THE ROYAL PAIR WERE INFORMED THAT AS LONG AS THEY WOULD DO THE KING OF FRANCE THE FAVOUR TO ACCEPT OF HIS HOSPITALITY
AND NEVER BETTER EXEMPLIFIED THAN IN THE PRESENT EXISTING STATE OF AFFAIRS
THE REST MEANTIME FINDING THEIR ADVERSARY THUS MATCHED FOR THE MOMENT PAUSED IN THEIR HEADLONG HURRY AND TURNED TO THE SHIVERING GROUP OF WOMEN IN THE CORNER AS IF DETERMINED TO EMULATE HIS FATHER AND HAVE A SUN WOMAN OF SOME SORT TO SHARE HIS FUTURE THRONE
BEING THE DAY SET APART FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THEIR MARRIAGE IT COMMENCED WITH THE RINGING OF THE VILLAGE BELLS THE SUN SHONE FORTH IN ALL HIS UNIVERSAL GLORY
IRENE WAS AROUSED BY THE RINGING OF THE BREAKFAST BELL BEFORE SHE GOT TIME TO FINISH THE SENTENCE THAT TROUBLED HER WEARY BRAIN FOR MONTHS BEFORE DRESSING HERSELF WITH FRANTIC EXPERTNESS SHE DASHED DOWN THE WINDING STAIRCASE
UNTIL HE CAME TO THE GREAT HALL IN WHICH THE MOMENT HE ENTERED IT AROSE A GREAT GOBLIN SHOUT THE LAST OF THE MEN AT ARMS THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF WAS ON THE FLOOR BURIED BENEATH A WALLOWING CROWD OF GOBLINS
TO BESTOW UPON HER HIS CHOICE COLLECTION OF LOVE'S PUREST FRAGRANCE WHICH SHOULD CAST THE SWEETEST SCENT OF MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP THROUGHOUT THE DAZZLING APARTMENTS OF THE MANSION SHE WAS ABOUT TO GRACE
THE UNFORTUNATE EXILE BOWED SO LOW THAT IT SEEMED AS IF HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE THE KNEES OF HIS PROTECTOR LEWIS RAISED HIM AND EMBRACED HIM WITH BROTHERLY TENDERNESS THE TWO KINGS THEN ENTERED THE QUEEN'S ROOM
HER FACE STREAMING WITH BLOOD AND HER EYES FLASHING GREEN LIGHTNING THROUGH IT SHE CAME ON WITH HER MOUTH OPEN AND HER TEETH GRINNING LIKE A TIGER'S FOLLOWED BY THE KING AND HER BODYGUARD OF THE THICKEST GOBLINS
HOW HE HAD BEEN RESCUED BY THE PRINCESS EVERYTHING INDEED UNTIL HE WAS WOUNDED CAPTURED AND IMPRISONED BY THE MEN AT ARMS AND NOW HE THOUGHT HE WAS LYING WIDE AWAKE WHERE THEY HAD LAID HIM WHEN SUDDENLY HE HEARD A GREAT THUNDERING SOUND THE COBS ARE COMING
THE INHABITANTS OF THE HAGUE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM INSULTING ALBEVILLE HIS HOUSE WAS SO CLOSELY BESET BY THE POPULACE DAY AND NIGHT
DID THE THOUGHT EVER FLASH THROUGH HER MIND THAT NEVER AGAIN WOULD SHE BE ABLE TO POUR INTO THE EAR OF HER TRUSTED HELPER THE SECRETS OF THE HEART OF DECEPTION WHICH FOR THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS HAD RAGED SO FURIOUSLY WITHIN HER
FOR HE HAD SOON FOUND THEIR HEADS ALL BUT INVULNERABLE THE QUEEN HAD ATTACKED HIS LEGS AND FEET WITH HER HORRIBLE GRANITE SHOE AND HE WAS SOON DOWN BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD GOT HIS BACK TO THE WALL AND STOOD OUT LONGER
AND LIFTED THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN WHO WAS ALL BUT PRESSED TO DEATH IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE HE RECOVERED BREATH AND CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE'S THE PRINCESS CRIED CURDIE AGAIN AND AGAIN NO ONE KNEW AND OFF THEY ALL RUSHED IN SEARCH OF HER
YEA ACUTELY FROM THE BLOW STRUCK HIM ON THE EVE OF ASPIRATION AND ACHIEVEMENT LOVE ALAS WHEN SMITTEN WITH THE SWORD OF INDIFFERENCE DIETH SOON BUT ONCE STRUCK ON THE TUNNELLED CHEEK OF SECRECY WITH THE HAND OF PITY
EMBLEMS OF THE APPROACHING FESTIVITY DID NOT FAIL TO APPEAR ON THE HOUSETOPS OF THE HUMBLEST VILLAGE PEASANT GLADNESS REIGNED THROUGHOUT THE HOUSEHOLD AND ALL HEARTS SAVE TWO REJOICED WITH UNABATED ACTIVITY
CURDIE BURST IN DANCING AND GYRATING AND STAMPING AND SINGING LIKE A SMALL INCARNATE WHIRLWIND
HAD NOT THE TUITIONAL CLICK OF BYGONE ATTACHMENT KEPT MOVING WITH MEASURED PACE UNTIL STOPPED AFTER MONTHS OR IT MAY BE SMALL YEARS OF CONSTANT SWINGING
THE BISHOP OF BARELEGS AND CANON FOOT WITH HIGHLY IMPRESSED AND OPEN FALSEHOOD AS THAT PRACTISED BY HER IN THE ABSENCE OF LABOURING UNDER SUCH A SOLEMN VOW WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BREATHLESS SURPRISE
HER BELOVED BENEFACTORS WHO HAD BEEN THE PRIME MOVERS IN THE MATTER OF MATRIMONY SAW PLAINLY A SADDENED LOOK ABOUT THE LOVELY FACE
HE CAME DOWN WITH ALL THE WEIGHT OF HIS IRON SHOD SHOE UPON HER SKIN SHOD FOOT AND WITH A HIDEOUS HOWL SHE DROPPED HIM SQUATTED ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK HER FOOT IN BOTH HER HANDS MEANWHILE THE REST RUSHED ON THE KING AND THE BODYGUARD SENT THEM FLYING
BUT THE SAME MOMENT IN RUSHED THE CAPTAIN AND HIS MEN AND RAN AT THEM STAMPING FURIOUSLY THEY DARED NOT ENCOUNTER SUCH AN ONSET AWAY THEY SCURRIED THE QUEEN FOREMOST OF COURSE
AS BEFORE STATED FEW WERE THOSE INVITED TO BE PRESENT AT THE WEDDING CEREMONY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK NOON SIR JOHN ARRIVED AT THE CASTLE SHORTLY BEFORE THAT TIME LOOKING CHARMING INDEED
SHE OPENED THE CASKET AND FOUND IN IT SIX THOUSAND PISTOLES ON THE FOLLOWING DAY JAMES ARRIVED AT SAINT GERMAINS LEWIS WAS ALREADY THERE TO WELCOME HIM
BUT WAS HONOURED WITH A FRIENDLY LETTER IN THE HANDWRITING OF LEWIS MARY WAS ON THE ROAD TOWARDS THE FRENCH COURT WHEN NEWS CAME THAT HER HUSBAND HAD AFTER A ROUGH VOYAGE LANDED SAFE AT THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF AMBLETEUSE
THE SETTING MOON WAS THROWING A FEEBLE LIGHT THROUGH THE CASEMENT AND THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF UPROAR THERE WAS SOFT HEAVY MULTITUDINOUS STAMPING A CLASHING AND CLANGING OF WEAPONS THE VOICES OF MEN AND THE CRIES OF WOMEN MIXED WITH A HIDEOUS BELLOWING
THE IMPOSTURY OF POSITION IS PETTY AND ENDS AS IT SHOULD COMMENCE WITH STIRRING STRIFE
CURDIE MADE ONE STAB AT HIM AS HE DISAPPEARED CAUGHT HOLD OF THE SENSELESS LOOTIE AND HAVING DRAGGED HER BACK TO THE CORNER THERE MOUNTED GUARD OVER HER PREPARING ONCE MORE TO ENCOUNTER THE QUEEN
WAS ABSOLUTELY REGULATED BY THEIR SOVEREIGN BUT IT WAS BEYOND EVEN HIS POWER TO PREVENT THEM FROM THINKING FREELY AND FROM EXPRESSING WHAT THEY THOUGHT IN PRIVATE CIRCLES WITH THE KEEN AND DELICATE WIT CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIR NATION AND OF THEIR ORDER
BUT YET AGAIN HE FOUND HIMSELF SNUG IN BED TWENTY TIMES HE TRIED AND TWENTY TIMES HE FAILED FOR IN FACT HE WAS NOT AWAKE ONLY DREAMING THAT HE WAS AT LENGTH IN AN AGONY OF DESPAIR
SHOULD AS KING OF FRANCE QUARTER THE LILIES WITH THE ENGLISH LIONS AND SHOULD AS KING OF FRANCE DRESS IN VIOLET ON DAYS OF COURT MOURNING THE DEMEANOUR OF THE FRENCH NOBILITY ON PUBLIC OCCASIONS
DID SHE IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE TO WHOM SHE OWED ANYTHING BUT DISOBEDIENCE EVEN IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM SHOULD BE WRESTED FROM HER ARMS OF COMPANIONSHIP ERE HER RETURN TO DUNFERN MANSION
THE GOBLINS WOULD HAVE TORN THEM ALL TO PIECES BUT THE KING HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO CARRY THEM AWAY ALIVE AND OVER EACH OF THEM IN TWELVE GROUPS WAS STANDING A KNOT OF GOBLINS WHILE AS MANY AS COULD FIND ROOM WERE SITTING UPON THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES
SEIZED WITH THE HORRIBLE CONVICTION THAT HARELIP HAD ALREADY CARRIED HER OFF HE RUSHED AMONGST THEM UNABLE FOR WRATH TO SING ANY MORE BUT STAMPING AND CUTTING WITH GREATER FURY THAN EVER
TAKEN ON HIMSELF THE EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION A GENERAL CRY OF PRIDE AND JOY ROSE FROM ALL THE DUTCH FACTIONS AN EXTRAORDINARY MISSION WAS WITH GREAT SPEED DESPATCHED TO CONGRATULATE HIM
ONLY SEVEN DAYS AND THIS BEAUTIFUL BOUDOIR SHALL OWN ME NO MORE WITH ITS WALLS OF PUREST WHITE AND GILDED BORDERS JUST SEVEN DAYS AND I SHALL BE FETTERED WITH CHAINS OF DRAGGING DISLIKE AND DISAPPOINTMENT
OF LADY DILWORTH CHIEFLY AND THOSE PRESENT ALSO WHO ONLY THE EVENING PREVIOUS HAD BEEN POURING SUCH PRAISES OVER THE MAGNIFICENT DUCHESSE SATIN GOWN
LEWIS REMARKED THE OMISSION AND NOTICED IT IN SUCH A VOICE AND WITH SUCH A LOOK THAT THE WHOLE PEERAGE WAS EVER AFTER READY TO KISS HER SHOE WHEN ESTHER JUST WRITTEN BY RACINE WAS ACTED AT SAINT CYR MARY HAD THE SEAT OF HONOUR
THE QUEEN GAVE A HOWL OF RAGE AND DISMAY AND BEFORE SHE RECOVERED HER PRESENCE OF MIND CURDIE HAVING BEGUN WITH THE GROUP NEAREST HIM HAD ELEVEN OF THE KNIGHTS ON THEIR LEGS AGAIN STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE CRIED AS EACH MAN ROSE
WAS MUCH LESS RARE AND ADMIRABLE THAN THE EXQUISITE DELICACY WITH WHICH HE LABOURED TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS OF HIS GUESTS AND TO LIGHTEN THE ALMOST INTOLERABLE WEIGHT OF THE OBLIGATIONS WHICH HE LAID UPON THEM
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVING TO ALL EUROPE
THUS WERE JOINED TWO HEARTS OF WIDELY DIFFERENT BEAT ONE OF INTENSE LOVE WHICH HEARSAY NEVER COULD SHAKE THE OTHER OF DIRE DISLIKE WHICH REASON COULD NEVER ALTER BORN UNDER A LUCKY STAR
BUT SPARINGLY DURING THE CEREMONY ALL OF WHICH WERE MOSTLY ACCEPTED COSTLY MULTIPLYING AND VARIED WERE THE GIFTS RECEIVED BY IRENE ENOUGH TO MAKE A PRINCESS STARE WITH STARTLING BEWILDERMENT
AND SITTING DOWN TO THE RIGHT OF HER UPON WHOM SHE HAD THAT DAY FLUNG IN THE FACE OF DEVOTION THE LAST DREGS OF DEFIANCE BEGGED TO OFFER AN APOLOGY FOR SUCH UNRULY CONDUCT AND ADDED
AND ASKING WHY IT APPEARED AT THIS GAY TIME WAS ANSWERED EVASIVELY INDEED LORD AND LADY DILWORTH WERE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS
THAT SHE DARE NOT TRUST HERSELF TO OFFER HER THE FIRST MOTHERLY EMBRACE IRENE PERCEIVING THE GREAT EMBARRASSMENT OF HER BELOVED LADY DILWORTH GLIDED ACROSS THE ROOM
WAS THE WHISPERED ECHO THROUGHOUT THE DISTINGUISHED GUESTS WHO SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST AFTER THE JUNCTION OF OPPOSITES YEA THIS WAS A REMARK OF TRUTH VISIBLY
THE ONLY APPLAUSE BY WHICH HIS STOICAL NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN STRONGLY MOVED WAS THE APPLAUSE OF HIS DEAR NATIVE COUNTRY OF HIS IMMENSE POPULARITY IN ENGLAND HE SPOKE WITH COLD DISDAIN
EITHER IN TIME OF REJOICING OR SORROWING PREPARATIONS WERE AT LAST ALMOST COMPLETED FOR SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS EVENT INVITATIONS WERE ISSUED NUMEROUSLY FOR THE RECEPTION TO BE HELD AT DILWORTH CASTLE AFTER IRENE'S MARRIAGE
JAMES WAS AT HER RIGHT HAND LEWIS MODESTLY PLACED HIMSELF ON THE LEFT NAY HE WAS WELL PLEASED THAT IN HIS OWN PALACE AN OUTCAST LIVING ON HIS BOUNTY SHOULD ASSUME THE TITLE OF KING OF FRANCE
CAME DOWN AS SHE STARTED BACK WITH ALL HIS WEIGHT ON THE PROPER FOOT AND SPRUNG TO LOOTIE'S RESCUE THE PRINCE HAD TWO DEFENCELESS FEET AND ON BOTH OF THEM CURDIE STAMPED JUST AS HE REACHED THE HOLE HE DROPPED HIS BURDEN AND ROLLED SHRIEKING INTO THE EARTH
THEIR OPINION OF MARY WAS FAVOURABLE THEY FOUND HER PERSON AGREEABLE AND HER DEPORTMENT DIGNIFIED THEY RESPECTED HER COURAGE AND HER MATERNAL AFFECTION AND THEY PITIED HER ILL FORTUNE
OR HAD SHE ONLY HINTED TO LADY DILWORTH HER MANIFEST INABILITY TO RETURN SIR JOHN'S GREAT AFFECTION MATTERS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REACHED ANOTHER CLIMAX BUT OWING TO THE PRESENT PRECARIOUS POSITION IN WHICH LORD AND LADY DILWORTH STOOD
THE PARTY WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO HIM WAS TRIUMPHANT ENTHUSIASTIC FULL OF LIFE AND ENERGY THE PARTY FROM WHICH ALONE HE COULD EXPECT SERIOUS OPPOSITION WAS DISUNITED AND DISHEARTENED OUT OF HUMOUR WITH ITSELF
SUMPTUOUS FURNITURE HAD BEEN HASTILY SENT IN THE NURSERY OF THE PRINCE OF WALES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY FURNISHED WITH EVERYTHING THAT AN INFANT COULD REQUIRE ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS PRESENTED TO THE QUEEN THE KEY OF A SUPERB CASKET WHICH STOOD IN HER APARTMENT
THIS STRANGE APATHY THEY ATTRIBUTED NOT TO PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION BUT TO STUPIDITY AND MEANNESS OF SPIRIT
IT WAS A MORNING NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN BY LORD AND LADY DILWORTH WHO ON THAT DAY WOULD BE ROBBED OF THE TREASURE HELD FIRM AND FAST BY THEM FOR THE LENGTHENED PERIOD OF NINE YEARS AND WHICH THEY YIELDED UP WITH HEARTS OF SORROW
NONE OF THEM COULD GIVE THE LEAST INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PRINCESS LOOTIE WAS ALMOST SILLY WITH TERROR AND ALTHOUGH SCARCELY ABLE TO WALK WOULD NOT LEAVE CURDIE'S SIDE FOR A SINGLE MOMENT AGAIN HE ALLOWED THE OTHERS TO SEARCH THE REST OF THE HOUSE
HARELIP RUSHED AT THEM CAUGHT UP LOOTIE AND SPED WITH HER TO THE HOLE SHE GAVE A GREAT SHRIEK AND CURDIE HEARD HER AND SAW THE PLIGHT SHE WAS IN GATHERING ALL HIS STRENGTH HE GAVE THE QUEEN A SUDDEN CUT ACROSS THE FACE WITH HIS WEAPON
HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF PERSUADING THEM TO TASTE THE WINE AND AS HE HAD HOPED THEY NO SOONER TASTED THAN THEY WANTED MORE THE ROUTED GOBLINS ON THEIR WAY BELOW JOINED THEM AND WHEN CURDIE ENTERED THEY WERE ALL WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS
AND ELECTED WITHOUT ANY CONTEST FOUR GREAT MERCHANTS WHO WERE ZEALOUS WHIGS THE KING AND HIS ADHERENTS HAD HOPED THAT MANY RETURNING OFFICERS WOULD TREAT THE PRINCE'S LETTER AS A NULLITY BUT THE HOPE WAS DISAPPOINTED
THROUGH EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE THEY WENT BUT NOWHERE WAS SHE TO BE FOUND NEITHER WAS ONE OF THE SERVANTS TO BE SEEN BUT CURDIE WHO HAD KEPT TO THE LOWER PART OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS NOW QUIET ENOUGH BEGAN TO HEAR A CONFUSED SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUBBUB
WHERE EXCEPT A DISMAYED GOBLIN LURKING HERE AND THERE THEY FOUND NO ONE WHILE HE REQUESTED LOOTIE TO TAKE HIM TO THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE HALL WAS NEARLY EMPTY THE GOBLINS RUNNING FROM IT AS FAST AS THEY COULD HOWLING AND SHRIEKING AND LIMPING AND COWERING EVERY NOW AND THEN AS THEY RAN TO CUDDLE THEIR WOUNDED FEET IN THEIR HARD HANDS OR TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE FRIGHTFUL STAMP STAMP OF THE ARMED MEN
AND NOW CURDIE APPROACHED THE GROUP WHICH IN TRUSTING IN THE QUEEN AND HER SHOE KEPT THEIR GUARD OVER THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN
AT SAINT GERMAINS ON THE VERGE OF A FOREST SWARMING WITH BEASTS OF CHASE AND ON THE BROW OF A HILL WHICH LOOKS DOWN ON THE WINDINGS OF THE SEINE FRANCIS THE FIRST HAD BUILT A CASTLE AND HENRY THE FOURTH HAD CONSTRUCTED A NOBLE TERRACE
HE WHO HAD HITHERTO ON ALL QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENCE BEEN SENSITIVE LITIGIOUS INSOLENT WHO HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONCE READY TO PLUNGE EUROPE INTO WAR RATHER THAN CONCEDE THE MOST FRIVOLOUS POINT OF ETIQUETTE
AFTER THE IMPORTANT CEREMONY WAS PERFORMED AND THE REGISTER SIGNED SIR JOHN AND LADY DUNFERN WHEN THE USUAL CONGRATULATIONS WERE ENDED
SHE WAS RECONCILED THAT NEITHER THE MARRIAGE ROBE OF PURITY
THE GOBLINS IN THE KING'S HOUSE WHEN CURDIE FELL ASLEEP HE BEGAN AT ONCE TO DREAM HE THOUGHT HE WAS ASCENDING THE MOUNTAINSIDE FROM THE MOUTH OF THE MINE
ON A SPOT SINGULARLY STERILE AND UNWHOLESOME ALL SAND OR MUD WITHOUT WOOD WITHOUT WATER AND WITHOUT GAME SAINT GERMAINS HAD NOW BEEN SELECTED TO BE THE ABODE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY OF ENGLAND
THERE LEAVES A SCAR OF INDELIBLE INTOLERANCE UNTIL WIPED OUT FOR EVER WITH THE CURATIVE BALSAM OF BATTLED FREEDOM SIR JOHN AND IRENE MET IN DILWORTH CASTLE FOR THE LAST TIME ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY OF AUGUST
WHEN CURDIE WAS WITHIN A FEW PACES SHE RUSHED AT HIM MADE ONE TREMENDOUS STAMP AT HIS OPPOSING FOOT WHICH HAPPILY HE WITHDREW IN TIME AND CAUGHT HIM ROUND THE WAIST TO DASH HIM ON THE MARBLE FLOOR BUT JUST AS SHE CAUGHT HIM
AND TOO SELDOM TERMINATES VICTORIOUSLY GREAT MERCY ONLY ANOTHER WEEK AND I SHALL ALMOST CEASE TO BE A FREE THINKER JUST SEVEN DAYS MORE AND WHAT I SHALL OPENLY HAVE TO CONFESS TO THE WORLD AN UNTRUTH
THE INTENSE EXCITEMENT THAT FOR WEEKS BEFORE HAD FOUND SUCH REFUGE WITHIN THEIR CHERISHED AND MUCH LOVED HOME
BUT THE QUEEN STOOD IN FRONT LIKE AN INFURIATED CAT WITH HER PERPENDICULAR EYES GLEAMING GREEN AND HER HAIR STANDING HALF UP FROM HER HORRID HEAD HER HEART WAS QUAKING HOWEVER AND SHE KEPT MOVING ABOUT HER SKIN SHOD FOOT WITH NERVOUS APPREHENSION
OF THE RESIDENCES OF THE FRENCH KINGS NONE STOOD IN A MORE SALUBRIOUS AIR OR COMMANDED A FAIRER PROSPECT THE HUGE SIZE AND VENERABLE AGE OF THE TREES THE BEAUTY OF THE GARDENS THE ABUNDANCE OF THE SPRINGS WERE WIDELY FAMED
THOUGH DEPARTING FROM THE RULES LAID DOWN BY LADY DILWORTH DEMANDED FROM ALL PRESENT REMARKS BORDERING ON SIMILARITY SHE LOOKED NERVOUSLY PALE BUT QUEENLY
HAD REACHED THE LAST AND ONLY BITE OF SUDDEN TERMINATION AND THEREBY STAMPED THEIR MARKS OF MELANCHOLY SO IMPRESSIVELY UPON THE NOBLE BROWS OF THE WORTHY OWNERS OF DILWORTH CASTLE THAT TIME COULD NEVER BLOT THEM FROM OBSERVATION
THAT ALL WOULD BE REVEALED AT A FUTURE DATE WHEN LEAST EXPECTED IN THE VERY ROOM WHERE SIR JOHN WAS FIRST PUZZLED CONCERNING THE BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT WAS HE NOW MADE THE RECIPIENT OF THE ORIGINAL
DID LADY DUNFERN EVER DREAM THAT HER APOLOGY FOR DISOBEDIENCE TO LADY DILWORTH'S ORDERS IN NOT ARRAYING HERSELF IN THE GARB OF GLISTENING GLORY COULD EVER BE ACCEPTED EVEN BY THE KIND AND LOVING LADY DILWORTH
LURK NO MORE AROUND THE VALE OF VANITY LIKE A VINDICTIVE VIPER STRIKE THE LYRE OF LIVING DECEPTION TO THE STRAINS OF DULL DEADNESS DESPAIR AND DOUBT
WHICH SOUNDED VICTORIOUS THE COBS WERE IN THE HOUSE HE SPRANG FROM HIS BED HURRIED ON SOME OF HIS CLOTHES NOT FORGETTING HIS SHOES WHICH WERE ARMED WITH NAILS THEN SPYING AN OLD HUNTING KNIFE OR SHORT SWORD HANGING ON THE WALL HE CAUGHT IT
HE RUSHED AMONGST THEM SHOUTING ONE TWO HIT AND HEW THREE FOUR BLAST AND BORE AND WITH EVERY RHYME HE CAME DOWN A GREAT STAMP UPON A FOOT CUTTING AT THE SAME TIME THEIR FACES EXECUTING INDEED A SWORD DANCE OF THE WILDEST DESCRIPTION
AS SOON AS THE NEWS THAT THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND WAS ON THE FRENCH COAST HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO VERSAILLES A PALACE WAS PREPARED FOR HER RECEPTION CARRIAGES AND TROOPS OF GUARDS WERE DESPATCHED TO AWAIT HER ORDERS
WHEN HE CAME UPON A WOMAN AND CHILD WHO HAD LOST THEIR WAY AND FROM THAT POINT HE WENT ON DREAMING EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE HE THUS MET THE PRINCESS AND LOOTIE HOW HE HAD WATCHED THE GOBLINS HOW HE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THEM
GOOD PROTESTANTS WHOM NO EXERTIONS MUST BE SPARED TO CARRY IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING AND OF THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND THESE CANDIDATES WERE NOW GENERALLY RETURNED WITHOUT OPPOSITION THE PRINCE GAVE STRICT ORDERS
LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH HAD BEEN BORN THERE HAD WHEN A YOUNG MAN HELD HIS COURT THERE HAD ADDED SEVERAL STATELY PAVILIONS TO THE MANSION OF FRANCIS AND HAD COMPLETED THE TERRACE OF HENRY
WAS NOW PUNCTILIOUS INDEED BUT PUNCTILIOUS FOR HIS UNFORTUNATE FRIENDS AGAINST HIMSELF HE GAVE ORDERS THAT MARY SHOULD RECEIVE ALL THE MARKS OF RESPECT THAT HAD EVER BEEN PAID TO HIS OWN DECEASED WIFE
TEN THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING WERE SENT FOR OUTFIT THE LIBERALITY OF LEWIS HOWEVER
HARELIP WITH ANOTHER COMPANY HAD GONE OFF TO SEARCH THE HOUSE THEY CAPTURED EVERY ONE THEY MET AND WHEN THEY COULD FIND NO MORE THEY HURRIED AWAY TO CARRY THEM SAFE TO THE CAVERNS BELOW BUT WHEN THE BUTLER WHO WAS AMONGST THEM FOUND THAT THEIR PATH LAY THROUGH THE WINE CELLAR
AND STILL MORE OUT OF HUMOUR WITH ITS NATURAL CHIEF
ONLY SEVEN DAYS AND THUS SHALL END MY CHERISHED HOPES MY GIRLISH PRIDE MY MOST ARDENT WISH BUT ALAS NOT MY LOVE SEVEN DAYS MORE SHALL SEE MY OWN DARLING OS SUDDENLY
WAS DEADLY SO TO OSCAR BUT FUTURE FACTS HAD TO BE SOLVED WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY WOULD BE TREATED WITH MORE COMPARATIVE REVERENCE THAN HERETOFORE BY HIM WHO SUFFERED SEVERELY
FINDING CURDIE AGAIN BUSY AMONGST HER UNFORTUNATE SUBJECTS SHE RUSHED AT HIM ONCE MORE WITH THE RAGE OF DESPAIR AND THIS TIME GAVE HIM A BAD BRUISE ON THE FOOT THEN A REGULAR STAMPING FIGHT GOT UP BETWEEN THEM
OR HER MADDENED DESIRE TO BECOME THE WIFE OF A POOR TUTOR HAD SHE ONLY TAKEN INTO HER CONFIDENCE HER WHOSE WISE COUNSEL AND MOTHERLY EXAMPLE WERE AT ALL TIMES A PROMPT STEP TO DECISION
AND CURDIE HAD NO LONGER ANY DOUBT THAT SHE HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AT THE VERY FIRST OF THE INROAD WITH A PANG OF DESPAIR HE SAW HOW WRONG THEY HAD BEEN IN NOT SECURING THE KING AND QUEEN AND PRINCE
BETTER LEAVE HER TO THE FREEDOM OF A WILL THAT ERE LONG WOULD SINK THE SHIP OF OPULENCE IN THE SEA OF PENURY AND WRING FROM HER THE WORDS LEAVE ME NOW DECEPTIVE DEMON OF DELUDED MOCKERY
HERE IS A GENTLEMAN SAID LEWIS TO MARY WHOM YOU WILL BE GLAD TO SEE THEN AFTER ENTREATING HIS GUESTS TO VISIT HIM NEXT DAY AT VERSAILLES AND TO LET HIM HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING THEM HIS BUILDINGS PICTURES AND PLANTATIONS
ARRAYED IN AN IRISH POPLIN OF THE DARKEST VISIBLE SHADE OF GREEN WITHOUT EITHER TRAIN OR FLOWER OF DISTINCTION NOT EVEN A SPECK OF RIBBON OR BORDER OF LACE AND NO ORNAMENT ONLY THE VALUED NECKLET WHICH GRACED HER PEARLY THROAT
FANCYING HE HEARD THE GOBLINS ALL OVER THE HOUSE HE GAVE A GREAT CRY THEN THERE CAME AS HE THOUGHT A HAND UPON THE LOCK OF HIS DOOR IT OPENED AND LOOKING UP HE SAW A LADY WITH WHITE HAIR CARRYING A SILVER BOX IN HER HAND ENTER THE ROOM
IT WOULD DIE ON THE DOORSTEP OF APPARENT BEREAVEMENT NEVER MORE TO APPEAR WITHIN DILWORTH CASTLE UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY KNEW WELL THAT THE GNAWING JAWS OF POVERTY WHICH FOR YEARS HAD FAILED TO EXPOSE THEIR GRINDING POWER
THE ELECTIONS WENT ON RAPIDLY AND SMOOTHLY THERE WERE SCARCELY ANY CONTESTS FOR THE NATION HAD DURING MORE THAN A YEAR BEEN KEPT IN CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF A PARLIAMENT WRITS INDEED HAD BEEN TWICE ISSUED AND TWICE RECALLED
BUT THAT MANY MORE GOBLIN FEET HAD TO GO LIMPING BACK OVER THE UNDERGROUND WAYS OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT MORNING PRESENTLY HOWEVER THEY WERE REINFORCED FROM ABOVE BY THE KING AND HIS PARTY WITH THE REDOUBTABLE QUEEN AT THEIR HEAD
WOULD THERE BE ANY MEANS OF FLIGHT FROM THE DANGEROUS DRAGON THAT HAUNTS ME NIGHT AND DAY COULD ANYTHING POSSIBLE BE DONE TO SAVE MYSELF FROM FALSE ALLIANCE TOO LATE TOO LATE
THE NOISE GREW AS HIS SHARP EARS GUIDED HIM TO A STAIR AND SO TO THE WINE CELLAR IT WAS FULL OF GOBLINS WHOM THE BUTLER WAS SUPPLYING WITH WINE AS FAST AS HE COULD DRAW IT WHILE THE QUEEN AND HER PARTY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE MEN AT ARMS
HE EMBRACED THE LITTLE PRINCE OF WALES AND MADE THE QUEEN SEAT HERSELF IN THE ROYAL STATE COACH ON THE RIGHT HAND THE CAVALCADE THEN TURNED TOWARDS SAINT GERMAINS
CAME THE MOST SPLENDID ARISTOCRACY OF EUROPE ALL FEATHERS RIBANDS JEWELS AND EMBROIDERY BEFORE THE PROCESSION HAD GONE FAR IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT MARY WAS APPROACHING LEWIS ALIGHTED AND ADVANCED ON FOOT TO MEET HER
STAMP ON THEIR FEET STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE SHOUTED AND IN A MOMENT THE GOBLINS WERE DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR LIKE RATS AND MICE THEY COULD NOT VANISH SO FAST HOWEVER
IN WHICH WERE VESSELS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FROM SAUCE PAN TO SILVER CUP PRESSING AROUND THE BUTLER WHO SAT AT THE TAP OF A HUGE CASK FILLING AND FILLING CURDIE CAST ONE GLANCE AROUND THE PLACE BEFORE COMMENCING HIS ATTACK
BEFORE HIS GORGEOUS COACH WENT THE SWISS HALBERDIERS ON EACH SIDE OF IT AND BEHIND IT RODE THE BODY GUARDS WITH CYMBALS CLASHING AND TRUMPETS PEALING
AND MASTERED THOROUGHLY THE EXPOSURE OF THE PAINFUL AGONY THROUGH WHICH SHE WAS PASSING KNOWING AS SHE DID AND FULLY BELIEVED THAT ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS
BUT JAMES THEY REGARDED WITH EXTREME CONTEMPT THEY WERE DISGUSTED BY HIS INSENSIBILITY BY THE COOL WAY IN WHICH HE TALKED TO EVERY BODY OF HIS RUIN AND BY THE CHILDISH PLEASURE WHICH HE TOOK IN THE POMP AND LUXURY OF VERSAILLES
FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE EXPEDITION SAILED THE ANXIETY OF THE WHOLE DUTCH NATION HAD BEEN INTENSE NEVER HAD THERE BEEN SUCH CROWDS IN THE CHURCHES NEVER HAD THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PREACHERS BEEN SO ARDENT
I WOULD NOT LET THE OCCASION PASS SENORA REPLIED CARDENIO OF TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK
SAID LITTLE JOHN SITTING UP AND FEELING HIS RIBS WHERE THE TANNER HAD CUDGELED HIM I MAKE MY VOW MY RIBS FEEL AS THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE BROKEN IN TWAIN
NOW HEAVEN FORFEND THAT MY GOOD TRUSTY LITTLE JOHN SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE KING'S RANGERS I MUST SEE TO THIS MATTER AND THAT QUICKLY THUS SPOKE ROBIN HOOD TO HIMSELF ALL HIS ANGER PASSING AWAY LIKE A BREATH FROM THE WINDOWPANE
QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TO HIMSELF WHAT YON KNAVE IS AFTER THAT HE SHOULD GO THUS PEEPING AND PEERING ABOUT I VERILY BELIEVE THAT YON SCURVY VARLET IS NO BETTER THAN A THIEF AND COMETH HERE AFTER OUR OWN AND THE GOOD KING'S DUN DEER FOR
FOR I KNOW MY GOOD MASTER WOULD NOT HAVE ME WET TO THE SKIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO OFF HE STRODE DOWN THE PATH THAT LAY THE WAY OF HIS LIKINGS NOW THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FOUL WEATHER BUT
FOR MARRIAGES SO UNEQUAL NEVER BROUGHT HAPPINESS NOR DID THEY CONTINUE LONG TO AFFORD THE ENJOYMENT THEY BEGAN WITH ALL THIS THAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED I SAID TO HIM AND MUCH MORE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT IN INDUCING HIM TO FOREGO HIS PURPOSE
AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
MAYHAP I MAY CHANCE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF THE DAINTY BROWN DARLINGS THUS EARLY IN THE MORN FOR THERE WAS NOTHING HE LOVED BETTER THAN TO LOOK UPON A TRIPPING HERD OF DEER
PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
THEN UP GOT LITTLE JOHN AND TAKING THE BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE THRUST INTO HIS BOSOM
I HAD NO POWER TO UTTER A CRY NOR I THINK DID HE GIVE ME TIME TO UTTER ONE AS HE IMMEDIATELY APPROACHED ME AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS FOR OVERWHELMED AS I WAS I WAS POWERLESS I SAY TO HELP MYSELF HE BEGAN TO MAKE SUCH
AND ON THE OTHER AS WELL LITTLE JOHN KNEW TO THE MERRY BLUE BOAR INN HERE LITTLE JOHN SUDDENLY CEASED WHISTLING AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH FIRST HE LOOKED UP AND THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND THEN TILTING HIS CAP OVER ONE EYE HE SLOWLY SCRATCHED THE BACK PART OF HIS HEAD FOR THUS IT WAS
HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER
FOR HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT WHO SHE WAS SHE HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING THE EXCITEMENT OF CARDENIO CONTINUING HER STORY WENT ON TO SAY
AND THIS I SAY LEST YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT ANY BUT MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SHALL EVER WIN ANYTHING OF ME IF THAT
THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS
EACH WATCHING FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE THE OTHER UNAWARE AND SO GET IN THE FIRST BLOW AT LAST LITTLE JOHN STRUCK LIKE A FLASH AND RAP THE TANNER MET THE BLOW AND TURNED IT ASIDE AND THEN SMOTE BACK AT LITTLE JOHN WHO ALSO TURNED THE BLOW AND SO THIS MIGHTY BATTLE BEGAN
THE LONG AUBURN TRESSES NOT ONLY COVERED HER SHOULDERS BUT SUCH WAS THEIR LENGTH AND ABUNDANCE CONCEALED HER ALL ROUND BENEATH THEIR MASSES SO THAT EXCEPT THE FEET NOTHING OF HER FORM WAS VISIBLE SHE NOW USED HER HANDS AS A COMB
TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
ALL THIS WAS HEARD DISTINCTLY BY THE CURATE AND THOSE WITH HIM AND AS IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE UTTERED CLOSE BY AS INDEED IT WAS THEY GOT UP TO LOOK FOR THE SPEAKER AND BEFORE THEY HAD GONE TWENTY PACES THEY DISCOVERED BEHIND A ROCK SEATED AT THE FOOT OF AN ASH TREE
WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
AND GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF MY AGE AND OF THE VERY DRESS I WORE AND I HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LAD WHO CAME WITH ME HAD TAKEN ME AWAY FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE A THING THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART SHOWING HOW LOW MY GOOD NAME HAD FALLEN SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD LOSE IT BY MY FLIGHT
I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
AND AS THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHILD TO MAKE THEIR HEIR AND ARE AFFECTIONATE PARENTS I WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDULGED DAUGHTERS THAT EVER PARENTS INDULGED
AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
THIS POOR FELLOW WHOM THOU HAST SO BELABORED IS COUNTED THE BEST HAND AT THE QUARTERSTAFF IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND HIS NAME IS LITTLE JOHN AND MINE ROBIN HOOD
AN AFFAIR OF SUCH NOTORIETY IN THE CITY THAT IT WAS THE TALK OF EVERY KNOT OF IDLERS IN THE STREET HE SAID THAT ON THE NIGHT OF DON FERNANDO'S BETROTHAL WITH LUSCINDA AS SOON AS SHE HAD CONSENTED TO BE HIS BRIDE BY SAYING YES SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN FAINTING FIT
BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
WERE I TO SEE ANY OF THE THINGS I SPEAK OF IN HIM WHOM MY PARENTS GAVE ME AS A HUSBAND HIS WILL SHOULD BE MINE AND MINE SHOULD BE BOUNDED BY HIS AND MY HONOUR BEING PRESERVED EVEN THOUGH MY INCLINATIONS WERE NOT
WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
MARRY A DID REACH OUT HIS ARM FULL LENGTH WHILE THOU STOOD GAPING AT HIM AND WITH A PRETTY RAP TUMBLED THEE OVER AS NEVER HAVE I SEEN ONE TUMBLED BEFORE SO SPOKE BOLD ROBIN
AT THE SAME TIME I ARGUED THE MATTER BRIEFLY IN MY OWN MIND SAYING TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT BE THE FIRST WHO HAS RISEN THROUGH MARRIAGE FROM A LOWLY TO A LOFTY STATION NOR WILL DON FERNANDO BE THE FIRST WHOM BEAUTY OR AS IS MORE LIKELY A BLIND ATTACHMENT
I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHN'S VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS
FOR EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT MUSIC SOOTHES THE TROUBLED MIND AND RELIEVES WEARINESS OF SPIRIT SUCH WAS THE LIFE I LED IN MY PARENTS HOUSE AND IF I HAVE DEPICTED IT THUS MINUTELY IT IS NOT OUT OF OSTENTATION OR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM RICH BUT
LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE
AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
AFTER AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN SOME TEARS THAT CAME TO HER EYES IN A CLEAR AND STEADY VOICE BEGAN HER STORY THUS
AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
THROUGH MY HANDS PASSED THE ACCOUNTS AND RETURNS OF WHAT WAS SOWN AND REAPED THE OIL MILLS THE WINE PRESSES THE COUNT OF THE FLOCKS AND HERDS THE BEEHIVES ALL IN SHORT THAT A RICH FARMER LIKE MY FATHER HAS OR CAN HAVE I HAD UNDER MY CARE
ACCORDINGLY QUITTING THE PATH HE WENT PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH SPYING NOW HERE AND NOW THERE WITH ALL THE WILES OF A MASTER OF WOODCRAFT AND OF ONE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE DONNED A DOUBLET OF LINCOLN GREEN
AS THUS HE STRODE ALONG IN ANGER PUTTING TOGETHER THE WORDS HE WOULD USE TO CHIDE LITTLE JOHN HE HEARD OF A SUDDEN LOUD AND ANGRY VOICES
ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
HAS LED TO MATE HIMSELF BELOW HIS RANK THEN SINCE I AM INTRODUCING NO NEW USAGE OR PRACTICE
AND TO CONFIRM HIS WORDS HE DREW A RICH RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT UPON MINE HE THEN TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND I WAS LEFT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SORROWFUL OR HAPPY ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS LEFT AGITATED AND TROUBLED IN MIND AND ALMOST BEWILDERED BY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
BUT THEY MUST ADD WITH WHOM I HAD FLED AND THAT ONE SO MUCH BENEATH ME AND SO UNWORTHY OF MY CONSIDERATION THE INSTANT I HEARD THE NOTICE I QUITTED THE CITY WITH MY SERVANT WHO NOW BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF WAVERING IN HIS FIDELITY TO ME AND THE SAME NIGHT FOR FEAR OF DISCOVERY
WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
BUT ALL MY CARE AND PAINS WERE UNAVAILING FOR MY MASTER MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT I WAS NOT A MAN AND HARBOURED THE SAME BASE DESIGNS AS MY SERVANT
AND AS THEY AGAIN REPEATED THEIR OFFERS AND ENTREATIES TO HER TO FULFIL HER PROMISE SHE WITHOUT FURTHER PRESSING FIRST MODESTLY COVERING HER FEET AND GATHERING UP HER HAIR SEATED HERSELF ON A STONE WITH THE THREE PLACED AROUND HER AND
NOW NEWS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO ROBIN HOOD HOW THAT LITTLE JOHN INSTEAD OF DOING HIS BIDDING HAD PASSED BY DUTY FOR PLEASURE AND SO HAD STOPPED OVERNIGHT WITH MERRY COMPANY AT THE BLUE BOAR INN INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT TO ANCASTER
IT WOULD BE IDLE FOR ME NOW TO MAKE ANY FURTHER PRETENCE OF WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD BELIEVE MORE OUT OF COURTESY THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON
AS THIS IS NOT LUSCINDA IT IS NO HUMAN CREATURE BUT A DIVINE BEING THE YOUTH THEN TOOK OFF THE MONTERA AND SHAKING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE THERE BROKE LOOSE AND SPREAD OUT A MASS OF HAIR THAT THE BEAMS OF THE SUN MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
OR AT LEAST TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PROTECTORS TO WATCH OVER ME AND THIS INTELLIGENCE OR SUSPICION MADE HIM ACT AS YOU SHALL HEAR ONE NIGHT AS I WAS IN MY CHAMBER WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN A DAMSEL WHO WAITED ON ME WITH
BY MUCH ROVING IN THE FOREST LITTLE JOHN HAD COME TO LOOK UPON ALL THE DEER IN SHERWOOD AS BELONGING TO ROBIN HOOD AND HIS BAND AS MUCH AS TO GOOD KING HARRY NAY
HA QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF HERE IS MERRY SPORT AFOOT NOW I WOULD GIVE THREE GOLDEN ANGELS FROM MY OWN POCKET IF YON STOUT FELLOW WOULD GIVE LITTLE JOHN A RIGHT SOUND DRUBBING IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO SEE HIM WELL THUMPED FOR HAVING FAILED IN MY BIDDING
NAY I PASS NOT FOR LENGTH ANSWERED THE TANNER MY STAFF IS LONG ENOUGH TO KNOCK DOWN A CALF SO LOOK TO THYSELF FELLOW I SAY AGAIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO EACH GRIPPED HIS STAFF IN THE MIDDLE AND WITH FELL AND ANGRY LOOKS THEY CAME SLOWLY TOGETHER
ALL THEIR WISHES CENTRED AND MINE WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIRS FOR I KNEW THEIR WORTH AND AS I WAS MISTRESS OF THEIR HEARTS SO WAS I ALSO OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THROUGH ME THEY ENGAGED OR DISMISSED THEIR SERVANTS
ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
WHO WAS INDEED THE ONE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM GAINED THE STREET BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF ME HE TOLD ME THOUGH NOT WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND FERVOUR AS WHEN HE CAME THAT I MIGHT REST ASSURED OF HIS FAITH AND OF THE SANCTITY AND SINCERITY OF HIS OATHS
FOR I WILL GIVE THEE SUCH A DRUBBING AS NE'ER HAST THOU HAD IN ALL THY LIFE BEFORE TAKE THY STAFF IN THY HAND FELLOW FOR I WILL NOT SMITE AN UNARMED MAN
YOU HAVE NO NEED TO ATTEMPT A FLIGHT SO HEEDLESS FOR NEITHER CAN YOUR FEET BEAR IT NOR WE ALLOW IT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERED SHE MADE NO REPLY TO THESE WORDS THEY HOWEVER CAME TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE TAKING HER HAND WENT ON TO SAY
HE LAID ASIDE THE ENTREATIES WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AT FIRST AND BEGAN TO USE VIOLENCE BUT JUST HEAVEN THAT SELDOM FAILS TO WATCH OVER AND AID GOOD INTENTIONS SO AIDED MINE THAT WITH MY SLIGHT STRENGTH AND WITH LITTLE EXERTION
AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO
AND I BEGAN IN SOME DEGREE TO RECOVER MYSELF I SAID TO HIM WITH MORE COURAGE THAN I THOUGHT I COULD HAVE POSSESSED
HAND AND FOOT TO ANY MAN IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND I WAS SEEKING THEE TO CHIDE THEE FOR LEAVING MY BIDDING UNDONE BUT THOU HAST BEEN PAID ALL I OWED THEE
THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
HIS CUDGEL FLYING FROM HIS HAND AS HE FELL THEN RAISING HIS STAFF STOUT ARTHUR DEALT HIM ANOTHER BLOW UPON THE RIBS HOLD ROARED LITTLE JOHN
NEVER HAD I THOUGHT TO SEE LITTLE JOHN SO EVENLY MATCHED IN ALL MY LIFE BELIKE THOUGH
FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
IT WAS SAID MOREOVER THAT DON FERNANDO WENT AWAY AT ONCE AND THAT LUSCINDA DID NOT RECOVER FROM HER PROSTRATION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE TOLD HER PARENTS HOW SHE WAS REALLY THE BRIDE OF THAT CARDENIO I HAVE MENTIONED I LEARNED BESIDES THAT CARDENIO
CALLED DOWN UPON HIMSELF A THOUSAND CURSES HEREAFTER SHOULD HE FAIL TO KEEP HIS PROMISE SHED MORE TEARS REDOUBLED HIS SIGHS
SO THAT THE KING'S RANGERS KEPT A SHREWD EYE UPON HIM AND HIS DOINGS FOR ARTHUR A BLAND'S HOUSE WAS APT TO HAVE APLENTY OF MEAT IN IT THAT WAS MORE LIKE VENISON THAN THE LAW ALLOWED NOW ARTHUR HAD BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN THE DAY BEFORE LITTLE JOHN SET FORTH ON HIS ERRAND
LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
ALL THIS WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IN THE CITY AND EVERYONE SPOKE OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT LUSCINDA WAS MISSING FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE CITY FOR SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE TO THE DISTRACTION OF HER PARENTS WHO KNEW NOT WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO RECOVER HER WHAT I LEARNED
FOR YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING TO REMEDY THEM OR ANY CONSOLATION TO ALLEVIATE THEM HOWEVER THAT MY HONOUR MAY NOT BE LEFT A MATTER OF DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS NOW THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED ME TO BE A WOMAN
PASSED THROUGH MY MIND IN A MOMENT BUT THE OATHS OF DON FERNANDO THE WITNESSES HE APPEALED TO THE TEARS HE SHED AND LASTLY THE CHARMS OF HIS PERSON AND HIS HIGH BRED GRACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH SIGNS OF GENUINE LOVE
BESIDES ALL THIS HE DEARLY LOVED THE LONGBOW
REVIVED MY HOPES AND I WAS BETTER PLEASED NOT TO HAVE FOUND DON FERNANDO THAN TO FIND HIM MARRIED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT YET ENTIRELY SHUT UPON RELIEF IN MY CASE AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HEAVEN HAD PUT THIS IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF THE SECOND MARRIAGE
HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
HAST THOU HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE TANNER GRIMLY HOLDING HIS STAFF ALOFT AY MARRY AND MORE THAN ENOUGH AND THOU DOST OWN THAT I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO YEA TRULY AND A MURRAIN SEIZE THEE
AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
AND I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT SEEING MY PRAISES IN HIS LETTERS FOR HOWEVER UGLY WE WOMEN MAY BE IT SEEMS TO ME IT ALWAYS PLEASES US TO HEAR OURSELVES CALLED BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT MY OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THIS
BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY AND WISHED TO HEAR THE END OF WHAT HE ALREADY ALL BUT KNEW SO HE MERELY SAID WHAT
AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
BY THIS THEY KNEW THAT WHAT HAD SEEMED A PEASANT WAS A LOVELY WOMAN NAY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THE EYES OF TWO OF THEM HAD EVER BEHELD OR EVEN CARDENIO'S IF THEY HAD NOT SEEN AND KNOWN LUSCINDA
A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
BUT AN HONEST CRAFTSMAN AS FOR MY COUNTENANCE IT IS WHAT IT IS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT THINE OWN IS NONE TOO PRETTY THOU SAUCY FELLOW HA QUOTH LITTLE JOHN IN A GREAT LOUD VOICE WOULDST THOU GIVE ME BACKTALK
CRUSH CLODS OR TO FOLLOW THE PLOUGH AND THE OXEN AS THEIR OWNER'S DRESS SUGGESTED AND SO FINDING THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED THE CURATE WHO WAS IN FRONT MADE A SIGN TO THE OTHER TWO TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND SOME FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT LAY THERE
INDULGING IN FAINT AND DISTANT HOPES OF CHERISHING THAT LIFE THAT I NOW ABHOR BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE CITY UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AS I COULD NOT FIND DON FERNANDO I HEARD NOTICE GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC CRIER OFFERING A GREAT REWARD TO ANYONE WHO SHOULD FIND ME
NAY QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TESTILY AT THE SAME TIME RISING CAREFULLY AS THOUGH HIS BONES HAD BEEN MADE OF GLASS I CAN HELP MYSELF GOOD FELLOW WITHOUT THY AID AND LET ME TELL THEE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT VILE COWSKIN CAP OF THINE
THEY ARE IN SHORT PEASANTS
FOR IT MAY BE THAT MY ILL FORTUNE CAME OF THEIRS IN NOT HAVING BEEN NOBLY BORN IT IS TRUE THEY ARE NOT SO LOW THAT THEY HAVE ANY REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF THEIR CONDITION
I WILL FOLLOW THEE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH GOOD MASTER AND NOT A HERD OF DUN DEER IN ALL THE FOREST BUT SHALL KNOW THE SOUND OF THE TWANG OF MY BOWSTRING AS FOR THEE LITTLE JOHN SAID ROBIN TURNING TO HIM AND LAUGHING
IF NOT TO RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AT LEAST TO OFFER YOU COMFORT FOR NO DISTRESS SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS CAN BE SO OPPRESSIVE OR REACH SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO MAKE THE SUFFERER REFUSE TO LISTEN TO COMFORT OFFERED WITH GOOD INTENTION AND SO SENORA
FOR HE TOO HAD TALKED HIMSELF INTO A FUME BIG WORDS NE'ER KILLED SO MUCH AS A MOUSE WHO ART THOU THAT TALKEST SO FREELY OF CRACKING THE HEAD OF ARTHUR A BLAND IF I DO NOT TAN THY HIDE THIS DAY AS NE'ER I TANNED A CALF'S HIDE IN ALL MY LIFE BEFORE
I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
AND SO I WAS LEFT BY MY MAID AND CEASED TO BE ONE AND HE BECAME A TRAITOR AND A PERJURED MAN THE DAY WHICH FOLLOWED THE NIGHT OF MY MISFORTUNE DID NOT COME SO QUICKLY I IMAGINE AS DON FERNANDO WISHED
THERE TO SELL A HALFSCORE OF TANNED COWHIDES AT THE DAWN OF THE SAME DAY THAT LITTLE JOHN LEFT THE INN HE STARTED FROM NOTTINGHAM HOMEWARD FOR BLYTH HIS WAY LED ALL IN THE DEWY MORN PAST THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST WHERE THE BIRDS WERE WELCOMING THE LOVELY DAY WITH A GREAT AND MERRY JUBILEE
AND NOW WHAT MAY BE THY NAME HA ARTHUR A BLAND QUOTH ROBIN I HAVE HEARD THY NAME BEFORE GOOD FELLOW THOU DIDST BREAK THE CROWN OF A FRIEND OF MINE AT THE FAIR AT ELY LAST OCTOBER THE FOLK THERE CALL HIM JOCK O NOTTINGHAM WE CALL HIM WILL SCATHELOCK
SO BEING VEXED TO HIS HEART BY THIS HE SET FORTH AT DAWN OF DAY TO SEEK LITTLE JOHN AT THE BLUE BOAR OR AT LEAST TO MEET THE YEOMAN ON THE WAY AND EASE HIS HEART OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE MATTER
AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
LITTLE JOHN TROD UPON A STICK WHICH SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT WHEREUPON HEARING THE NOISE THE TANNER TURNED QUICKLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YEOMAN SEEING THAT THE TANNER HAD SPIED HIM OUT LITTLE JOHN PUT A BOLD FACE UPON THE MATTER
ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
AND RECTITUDE ALONE AND BADE ME CONSIDER THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DON FERNANDO AND MYSELF FROM WHICH I MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT HIS INTENTIONS WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY HAD FOR THEIR AIM HIS OWN PLEASURE RATHER THAN MY ADVANTAGE
I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR GOOD SOVEREIGN'S DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY
AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO ROADS TWO VOICES BEGAN TO ALARUM WITHIN HIM THE ONE CRYING THERE LIES THE ROAD TO THE BLUE BOAR INN A CAN OF BROWN OCTOBER AND A MERRY NIGHT WITH SWEET COMPANIONS SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND THERE THE OTHER
I FEAR ME THOUGH THERE IS BUT POOR CHANCE OF MY SEEING SUCH A PLEASANT SIGHT SO SAYING HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AT LENGTH UPON THE GROUND THAT HE MIGHT NOT ONLY SEE THE SPORT THE BETTER BUT THAT HE MIGHT ENJOY THE MERRY SIGHT AT HIS EASE
I DID THINK THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COULD DO TO ME WHAT THOU HAST DONE THIS DAY AND SO THOUGHT I ALSO CRIED ROBIN HOOD BURSTING OUT OF THE THICKET AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
AT THE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS TRUSTY RIGHT HAND MAN WAS IN SOME DANGER OF HIS LIFE SO CAUTIOUSLY
I PUSHED HIM OVER A PRECIPICE WHERE I LEFT HIM WHETHER DEAD OR ALIVE I KNOW NOT AND THEN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN SEEMED POSSIBLE IN MY TERROR AND FATIGUE I MADE MY WAY INTO THE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT ANY OTHER THOUGHT OR PURPOSE SAVE THAT OF HIDING MYSELF AMONG THEM AND ESCAPING MY FATHER
BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
DOROTHEA HOWEVER DID NOT INTERRUPT HER STORY BUT WENT ON IN THESE WORDS THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE REACHED MY EARS
IT WAS SAID TOO THAT HER NAME WAS LUSCINDA AND THAT AT THE BETROTHAL SOME STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED
AND I NEVER GAVE DON FERNANDO A WORD IN REPLY THAT COULD HOLD OUT TO HIM ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS HOWEVER REMOTE ALL THIS CAUTION OF MINE WHICH HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR COYNESS HAD APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS WANTON APPETITE FOR
AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF
AND ARE RISING UP TO THE HIGHER GROUND OF THE COUNTRY OF THE PINES AND THE LAKES LOOK FROM THE WINDOW AS YOU GO THE CITY IS FAR BEHIND NOW
THAT THE TRAIN WAS THERE EVERY AFTERNOON PUFFING UP STEAM IN THE CITY STATION AND THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BOARDED IT ANY DAY AND GONE HOME NO NOT HOME OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T CALL IT HOME NOW
TWO OTHER HOUSES IN THE LITTLE COUNTRY TOWN OF WESTERHAM ARE FULL OF MEMORIES OF WOLFE ONE OF THESE WAS HIS FATHER'S A HOUSE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS BORN
IT'S GOD'S OWN COUNTRY WE HAVE NORTH OF FIFTY EIGHT OLAF AND WE HAVE TEN TIMES THE WEALTH OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN CARE FOR A MILLION PEOPLE EASILY BUT BAD POLITICS AND BAD JUDGMENT BOTH HERE IN ALASKA AND AT WASHINGTON
IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE THE OTHER HOUSE IS SQUERRYES COURT BELONGING THEN AND NOW TO THE WARDE FAMILY THE WOLFES CLOSEST FRIENDS WOLFE AND GEORGE WARDE WERE CHUMS FROM THE FIRST DAY THEY MET
WOLFE'S MOTHER TO WHOM HE OWED A GREAT DEAL OF HIS GENIUS WAS A DESCENDANT OF TWO GOOD FAMILIES IN YORKSHIRE SHE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIS FATHER AND WAS VERY TALL AND HANDSOME WOLFE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO ONE LIKE HER
MOST FORTUNATELY WOLFE WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO TAKE ILL AND SO HE WAS SENT HOME IN TIME TO SAVE HIM FROM THE FEVERS OF SPANISH AMERICA WOLFE WAS HAPPY TO SEE HIS MOTHER AGAIN TO HAVE HIS PONY TO RIDE AND HIS DOGS TO PLAY WITH
BUT HE FULL OF THE STIR AND EXCITEMENT OF A BIG CAMP HAD CARRIED THE LETTER IN HIS POCKET FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE ANSWERING IT THEN HE WROTE HER THE FIRST OF MANY LETTERS FROM DIFFERENT SEATS OF WAR THE LAST ONE OF ALL BEING WRITTEN JUST BEFORE HE WON THE VICTORY
THE OLD FLASH WAS IN HIS EYES AND HE WAS SEEING THE FIGHT AHEAD OF HIM AGAIN THE FIGHT TO DO HIS BIT IN STRIKING THE SHACKLES OF MISGOVERNMENT FROM ALASKA AND ROUSING THE WORLD TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MENACE WHICH HUNG OVER HER
ASK HIM IF HE EVER TASTED DUCK THAT COULD FOR A MOMENT BE COMPARED TO THE BLACK DUCKS IN THE RICE MARSH ALONG THE OSSAWIPPI AND AS FOR FISH AND FISHING
WHEN A WHOLE NATION WAS AFOOT TO FIGHT AND WHO WOULD NOT FIGHT THE SPANIARDS WHEN THEY CUT OFF BRITISH SAILORS EARS THAT WAS AN OLD TALE BY THIS TIME BUT THE FLAMES OF ANGER THREW IT INTO LURID RELIEF ONCE MORE
AND THAT MARY STANDISH WOULD ALWAYS LIVE IN HIS THOUGHTS NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED IN THE YEARS TO COME BUT HE WAS NOT THE SORT TO LET ANY PART OF HIMSELF WITHER UP AND DIE BECAUSE OF A BLOW THAT HAD DARKENED HIS MENTAL VISIONS OF THINGS HIS PLANS LAY AHEAD OF HIM
THIS IS LAKE OSSAWIPPI SURELY ENOUGH YOU WOULD KNOW IT ANYWHERE BY THE BROAD STILL BLACK WATER WITH HARDLY A RIPPLE AND WITH THE GRIP OF THE COMING FROST ALREADY ON IT SUCH A GREAT SHEET OF BLACKNESS IT LOOKS AS THE TRAIN THUNDERS ALONG THE SIDE
THEY HAVE LENGTHENED OUT THE TRAIN BY THIS TIME WITH A STRING OF FLAT CARS AND FREIGHT CARS BETWEEN WHERE WE ARE SITTING AND THE ENGINE BUT AT EVERY CROSSWAY
ONE TWO THREE
THAT MADE HIM FAMOUS ROUND THE WORLD NEWPORT ISLE OF WIGHT AUGUST SIXTH SEVENTEEN FORTY I RECEIVED MY DEAREST MAMMA'S LETTER ON MONDAY LAST BUT COULD NOT ANSWER IT THEN
AND IT PLEASED HIM TO THINK SHE WOULD HAVE MADE THIS SAME FIGHT FOR ALASKA IF SHE HAD LIVED IT WAS A THOUGHT WHICH BROUGHT A PAINFUL THICKENING IN HIS BREATH FOR ALWAYS THESE VISIONS WHICH OLAF COULD NOT SEE ENDED WITH MARY STANDISH
IT WAS TO BE ONE OF THE GRANDEST AND FINEST HOUSES THAT THOUGHT COULD CONCEIVE MUCH FINER IN TRUE REALITY THAN THAT VAST PALACE OF SANDSTONE WITH THE PORTE COCHERE AND THE SWEEPING CONSERVATORIES THAT YOU AFTERWARDS BUILT IN THE COSTLIER PART OF THE CITY
COULD NOT BE IMPROVISED IN THIS HURRIED THOUGH DISASTROUSLY SLOW PREPARATION FOR A WAR THE SHIP IN WHICH WOLFE WAS TO SAIL HAD BEEN LYING IDLE FOR YEARS AND HER PESTILENTIAL BILGE WATER SOON BEGAN TO MAKE THE SAILORS AND SOLDIERS SICKEN AND DIE
AND AFTER THAT FOR AN HOUR OR MORE SOMETHING LIVED FOR HIM IN THE GLOW OF THE FIRE WHICH OLAF KEPT BURNING IT WAS THE MEMORY OF MARY STANDISH HER QUIET BEAUTIFUL EYES GAZING AT HIM HER PALE FACE
NOR HAS THE MARTIAL SPIRIT DESERTED THE DESCENDANTS OF THE WOLFES IN THE GENERATION NOW ALIVE THEY ARE SOLDIERS STILL THE PRESENT HEAD OF THE FAMILY WHO REPRESENTED IT AT THE CELEBRATION OF THE TERCENTENARY OF THE FOUNDING OF QUEBEC
AND HE HEARD THE GIRL'S VOICE ANSWERING THEM IN HER HAPPINESS AND TURNING THAT HAPPINESS FROM THE RADIANCE OF HER EYES UPON HIM
PAPA AND I ARE JUST GOING ON BOARD BUT I BELIEVE SHALL NOT SAIL THIS FORTNIGHT IN WHICH TIME IF I CAN GET ASHORE AT PORTSMOUTH OR ANY OTHER TOWN I WILL CERTAINLY WRITE TO YOU AND WHEN WE ARE GONE BY EVERY SHIP WE MEET BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS MY DUTY
HOW GORGEOUS IT ONCE SEEMED AND WITH A BOX STOVE SET UP IN ONE END OF IT THE STOVE IS BURNING FURIOUSLY AT ITS STICKS THIS AUTUMN EVENING FOR THE AIR SETS IN CHILL AS YOU GET CLEAR AWAY FROM THE CITY
WITHIN A MONTH AN ARMY SUCH AS NO ONE HAD SEEN SINCE THE DAYS OF MARLBOROUGH HAD BEEN ASSEMBLED AT BLACKHEATH
I SUPPOSE VERY PROBABLY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ONE OF THESE WOOD ENGINES SINCE YOU WERE A BOY FORTY YEARS AGO THE OLD ENGINE WITH A WIDE TOP LIKE A HAT ON ITS FUNNEL AND WITH SPARKS ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP A SUIT FOR DAMAGES ONCE IN EVERY MILE
DO YOU SEE TOO THAT THE TRIM LITTLE CARS THAT CAME OUT OF THE CITY ON THE ELECTRIC SUBURBAN EXPRESS ARE BEING DISCARDED NOW AT THE WAY STATIONS ONE BY ONE AND IN THEIR PLACE IS THE OLD FAMILIAR CAR WITH THE STUFF CUSHIONS IN RED PLUSH
WOLFE'S PARENTS WENT TO LIVE AT WESTERHAM IN KENT SHORTLY AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED AND THERE ON JANUARY SECOND SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
AND THAT THERE ISN'T ONE OF THEM THAT DOESN'T SOMETIMES DREAM IN THE DULL QUIET OF THE LONG EVENING HERE IN THE CLUB THAT SOME DAY HE WILL GO BACK AND SEE THE PLACE THEY ALL DO ONLY THEY'RE HALF ASHAMED TO OWN IT
LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE IT EVERY DAY THINK IT'S ONLY THE TRAIN TO THE GOLF GROUNDS BUT THE JOKE IS THAT AFTER IT PASSES OUT OF THE CITY AND THE SUBURBS AND THE GOLF GROUNDS IT TURNS ITSELF LITTLE BY LITTLE INTO THE MARIPOSA TRAIN
THAT CROWD OF SUBURBAN PEOPLE GOING HOME ON COMMUTATION TICKETS AND SOMETIMES STANDING THICK IN THE AISLES THOSE ARE OF COURSE NOT MARIPOSA PEOPLE BUT LOOK ROUND A LITTLE BIT AND YOU'LL FIND THEM EASILY ENOUGH
WON'T LET THEM COME WITH COAL ENOUGH UNDER OUR FEET TO LAST A THOUSAND YEARS WE ARE BUYING FUEL FROM THE STATES WE'VE GOT BILLIONS IN COPPER AND OIL BUT CAN'T TOUCH THEM WE SHOULD HAVE SOME OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST MANUFACTURING PLANTS
WHEN THE SQUIRE HANDED HIM HIS FIRST COMMISSION AND THERE IT IS TO DAY AND ON IT ARE THE VERSES ENDING THIS SPOT SO SACRED WILL FOREVER CLAIM A PROUD ALLIANCE WITH ITS HERO'S NAME WOLFE WAS AT LAST AN OFFICER
THE LANKY RED HAIRED BOY OF THIRTEEN AND A HALF TOOK HIS SEAT ON THE PORTSMOUTH COACH BESIDE HIS FATHER THE VETERAN SOLDIER OF FIFTY FIVE HIS MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF MUCH TOO FINE A SPIRIT TO GRUDGE ANYTHING FOR THE SERVICE OF HER COUNTRY
BUT NO WONDER THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE FIVE O'CLOCK TRAIN FOR MARIPOSA VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT HUNDREDS OF THEM KNOW THAT THERE IS A TRAIN THAT GOES OUT AT FIVE O'CLOCK BUT THEY MISTAKE IT EVER SO MANY OF THEM THINK IT'S JUST A SUBURBAN TRAIN
TWICE HE HAD TRIED IT SINCE HIS OLD COMRADE HAD DIED AND TWICE HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN OUT THE NEXT TIME HE WOULD KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT AND HE INVITED ALAN TO GO WITH HIM THERE WAS A THRILL IN THIS TALK OF A LAND SO NEAR
ARE OF AN OLD AND HONOURABLE LINE MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO THEIR FOREFATHERS LIVED IN ENGLAND AND LATER ON IN WALES LATER STILL IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY BEFORE AMERICA WAS DISCOVERED THEY WERE LIVING IN IRELAND WOLFE'S FATHER HOWEVER
BY REASON I WAS AT CAMP TO SEE THE REGIMENTS OFF TO GO ON BOARD AND WAS TOO LATE FOR THE POST BUT AM VERY SORRY DEAR MAMMA THAT YOU DOUBT MY LOVE WHICH I'M SURE IS AS SINCERE AS EVER ANY SON'S WAS TO HIS MOTHER
ALREADY THE CONDUCTOR HAS CHANGED HIS GLAZED HAT FOR AN ORDINARY ROUND CHRISTIE
THE SOLDIER WHO WON CANADA FOR ENGLAND IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY NINE SAT UNDER THE ARMS OF THE KING IN WHOSE SERVICE THE SAILOR CABOT HOISTED THE FLAG OF ENGLAND OVER CANADIAN SOIL IN FOURTEEN NINETY SEVEN
ANY LIFE OF WOLFE CAN BE ARTIFICIALLY SIMPLIFIED BY TREATING HIS PURELY MILITARY WORK AS SOMETHING COMPLETE IN ITSELF
A SPANISH PORT IN CENTRAL AMERICA THE NEWS WAS CRIED THROUGH THE STREETS ALL NIGHT THE NOISE OF BATTLE SEEMED TO BE SOUNDING ALL ROUND SWINDEN'S SCHOOL WHERE MOST OF THE BOYS BELONGED TO NAVAL AND MILITARY FAMILIES
WHILE HE WAS ATTENDING TO HIS AFFAIRS AT THE BANK OLAF SECURED INFORMATION THAT ROSSLAND WAS RESTING COMFORTABLY IN THE HOSPITAL AND HAD NOT ONE CHANCE IN TEN OF DYING IT WAS NOT ALAN'S INTENTION TO SEE HIM
AND INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
HIS OLD AMBITIONS AND HIS DREAMS OF ACHIEVEMENT THEY SEEMED PULSELESS AND DEAD NOW BUT HE KNEW IT WAS BECAUSE HIS OWN FIRE HAD TEMPORARILY BURNED OUT AND HE REALIZED THE VITAL NECESSITY OF BUILDING IT UP AGAIN
SCARCELY A NIGHT RIDE ACROSS THE NECK OF BERING SEA AND YET AS PROSCRIBED AS THE SACRED PLAINS OF TIBET IT STIRRED OLD DESIRES IN ALAN'S BLOOD FOR HE KNEW THAT OF ALL FRONTIERS THE SIBERIAN WOULD BE THE LAST AND THE GREATEST
BUT THOUGH HE TRIED HIS BEST TO STICK TO HIS LESSONS HIS HEART WAS WILD FOR THE WAR HE AND GEORGE WARDE USED TO GO EVERY DAY DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS BEHIND THE PIGEON HOUSE AT SQUERRYES COURT AND PRACTISE WITH THEIR SWORDS AND PISTOLS
BUT THE MARINES WERE NOT THE CORPS FOR HIM THEIR SERVICE COMPANIES WERE FIVE THOUSAND MILES AWAY WHILE WAR WITH FRANCE WAS BREAKING OUT MUCH NEARER HOME SO WHAT WAS HIS DELIGHT AT RECEIVING ANOTHER COMMISSION ON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO
IT LEAVES THE CITY EVERY DAY ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE TRAIN FOR MARIPOSA STRANGE THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW OF IT THOUGH YOU COME FROM THE LITTLE TOWN OR DID LONG YEARS AGO ODD THAT YOU NEVER KNEW IN ALL THESE YEARS
THE FIGHT WE MUST WIN IS TO BRING ABOUT AN HONEST AND REASONABLE ADJUSTMENT OLAF AND THAT FIGHT WILL TAKE PLACE RIGHT HERE IN ALASKA AND NOT IN SIBERIA AND IF WE DON'T WIN HE RAISED HIS EYES FROM THE FIRE
TO WIPE AWAY THE SHADOWS OF TRAGEDY MARY STANDISH WAS WITH HIM AGAIN BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AT SKAGWAY SHE WAS AT HIS SIDE IN THE HEART OF THE TUNDRAS THE SUN IN HER SHINING HAIR AND EYES
YOU WOULD TAKE THE TRAIN AND GO BACK TO THE LITTLE TOWN TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOW AND IF THINGS HAD CHANGED MUCH SINCE YOUR DAY BUT EACH TIME WHEN YOUR HOLIDAYS CAME SOMEHOW YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND AND WENT DOWN TO
AND ALL ABOUT THEM THE WONDER OF WILD ROSES AND PURPLE IRIS AND WHITE SEAS OF SEDGE COTTON AND YELLOW EYED DAISIES AND BIRDS SINGING IN THE GLADNESS OF SUMMER HE HEARD THE BIRDS
WHERE HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AT SWINDEN'S HERE HE WORKED QUIETLY ENOUGH TILL JUST BEFORE HE ENTERED ON HIS TEENS THEN THE LONG PENT RAGE OF ENGLAND SUDDENLY BURST IN WAR WITH SPAIN THE PEOPLE WENT WILD WHEN THE BRITISH FLEET TOOK PORTO BELLO
BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT WHEN THE CITY IS WELL BEHIND YOU BIT BY BIT THE TRAIN CHANGES ITS CHARACTER THE ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE THAT TOOK YOU THROUGH THE CITY TUNNELS IS OFF NOW
AMONG HIS ANGLO IRISH KINSMEN WERE THE GOLDSMITHS AND THE SEYMOURS OLIVER GOLDSMITH HIMSELF
BESIDES IF IT IS NOT I WOULD DO IT OUT OF LOVE WITH PLEASURE I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT YOUR HEAD IS SO BAD WHICH I FEAR IS CAUSED BY YOUR BEING SO MELANCHOLY BUT PRAY DEAR MAMMA IF YOU LOVE ME DON'T GIVE YOURSELF UP TO FEARS FOR US
IT MAY BE A GENERATION FROM NOW MAYBE A CENTURY BUT IT'S COMING SURE AS GOD MAKES LIGHT IF WE LET ALASKA GO DOWN AND OUT AND MY WAY OF PREVENTING IT IS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS HE STARED INTO THE FIRE
AND HAD CHOSEN IT FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN IT WAS PRIMITIVE AND ALIVE WITH BIRDS OLAF LOVED THE BIRDS AND THE CHEER OF THEIR VESPER SONG AND BEDTIME TWITTER COMFORTED ALAN HE SEIZED AN AX
WHEN THEY ONCE GET STARTED AN IT'S UP TO A FEW ALASKA JACKS AN TOUGH NUT BILLS TO GET THEIR FEET PLANTED FIRST ON THE OTHER SIDE WILL YOU GO ALAN SHOOK HIS HEAD SOME DAY BUT NOT NOW
DON'T TELL ME THAT THE SPEED IS ONLY TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS
WHICH ROSSLAND MIGHT HAVE TOLD HIM THEY LEFT CORDOVA EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND AT SUNSET THAT EVENING CAMPED ON THE TIP OF A WOODED ISLAND A MILE OR TWO FROM THE MAINLAND OLAF KNEW THE ISLAND
THAT THAT TRAIN OF MINGLED FLAT CARS AND COACHES THAT GOES TEARING INTO THE NIGHT
WOLFE WAS DETERMINED TO GO AND FIGHT NOTHING COULD STOP HIM THERE WAS NO COMMISSION FOR HIM AS AN OFFICER NEVER MIND HE WOULD GO AS A VOLUNTEER AND WIN HIS COMMISSION IN THE FIELD SO ONE HOT DAY IN JULY SEVENTEEN FORTY
WHEN HE WAS A COLONEL AND HAD BEEN THROUGH THE WARS AND AT COURT HE STILL BELIEVED SHE WAS A MATCH FOR ALL THE BEAUTIES HE WAS NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO TAKE AFTER HER IN LOOKS EXCEPT IN HER ONE WEAK FEATURE A CUTAWAY CHIN HIS BODY INDEED
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN MONTHS HIS MUSCLES RESPONDED TO THE SWING OF IT AND ERICKSEN OLD AS HIS YEARS IN THE WAY OF THE NORTH WHISTLED LOUDLY AND RUMBLED A BIT OF CRUDE SONG THROUGH HIS BEARD AS HE LIGHTED A FIRE
INSIDE WAS A COMMISSION AS SECOND LIEUTENANT IN THE MARINES
HERE AND THERE IN THE CROWD THOSE PEOPLE WITH THE CLOTHES THAT ARE PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT AND YET LOOK ODD IN SOME WAY THE WOMEN WITH THE PECULIAR HATS
WHY SURELY YES LAKE OSSAWIPPI THE BIG LAKE AS THEY USED TO CALL IT FROM WHICH THE RIVER RUNS DOWN TO THE SMALLER LAKE LAKE WISSANOTTI WHERE THE TOWN OF MARIPOSA HAS LAIN WAITING FOR YOU THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS
NO DON'T BOTHER TO LOOK AT THE REFLECTION OF YOUR FACE IN THE WINDOW PANE SHADOWED BY THE NIGHT OUTSIDE NOBODY COULD TELL YOU NOW AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
AND LOVED IT TOO FOR THE LITTLE TOWN IN THE SUNSHINE THAT IT RAN TO
HOME MEANS THAT BIG RED SANDSTONE HOUSE OF YOURS IN THE COSTLIER PART OF THE CITY HOME MEANS IN A WAY THIS MAUSOLEUM CLUB WHERE YOU SOMETIMES TALK WITH ME
AND BUSINESSLIKE INTENTION OF SIFTING THE MATTER TO THE BOTTOM THAT HE MIGHT DISPROVE HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY AND SET HIMSELF RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES IN SELF DEFENSE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ROSSLAND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK DOWN WITH COLD FACTS
AND THE BUBBLING OF COFFEE OVER A BED OF COALS WITH THE MYSTERIOUS DARKNESS OF THE TIMBER GATHERING IN ABOUT HIM
BOTH WISHED TO GO INTO THE ARMY AND BOTH OF COURSE PLAYED SOLDIERS LIKE OTHER VIRILE BOYS WARDE LIVED TO BE AN OLD MAN AND ACTUALLY DID BECOME A FAMOUS CAVALRY LEADER
AS AN ENSIGN IN THE TWELFTH REGIMENT OF FOOT HE WAS NOW FIFTEEN AN OFFICER A SOLDIER BORN AND BRED EAGER TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY AND JUST APPOINTED TO A REGIMENT ORDERED TO THE FRONT
THAT NIGHT IN OLAF'S CABIN ALAN PUT HIMSELF BACK ON THE OLD TRACK AGAIN HE MADE NO EFFORT TO MINIMIZE THE TRAGEDY THAT HAD COME INTO HIS LIFE AND HE KNEW ITS EFFECT UPON HIM WOULD NEVER BE WIPED AWAY
OLAF FELT RESTING UPON HIM SOMETHING OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A DOCTOR AND AFTER SUPPER HE SAT WITH HIS BACK TO A TREE AND TALKED OF THE OLD DAYS AS IF THEY WERE YESTERDAY AND THE DAY BEFORE
BUT OF COURSE HOME WOULD HARDLY BE THE WORD YOU WOULD APPLY TO THE LITTLE TOWN UNLESS PERHAPS LATE AT NIGHT WHEN YOU'D BEEN SITTING READING IN A QUIET CORNER SOMEWHERE SUCH A BOOK AS THE PRESENT ONE NATURALLY YOU DON'T KNOW OF THE MARIPOSA TRAIN NOW
AND THAT NOT ONLY MEN BUT NATIONS WOULD PLAY THEIR PART IN THE BREAKING OF IT HE SAW THE RED GLEAM OF FIRELIGHT IN OLAF'S EYES AND IF WE DON'T GO IN FIRST FROM THIS SIDE ALAN
A LONG PEACE HAD MADE THE COUNTRY INDIFFERENT TO THE WELFARE OF THE ARMY AND NAVY NOW MEN WERE SUDDENLY BEING MASSED TOGETHER IN CAMPS AND FLEETS AS IF ON PURPOSE TO BREED DISEASE SANITATION ON A LARGE SCALE NEVER HAVING BEEN PRACTISED IN PEACE
AND SAT WATCHING OLAF AS HE MOTHERED THE HALF BAKED BANNOCK LOAF IT MADE HIM THINK OF HIS FATHER A THOUSAND TIMES THE TWO MUST HAVE CAMPED LIKE THIS IN THE DAYS WHEN ALASKA WAS NEW AND THERE WERE NO MAPS TO TELL THEM WHAT LAY BEYOND THE NEXT RANGE
AND WITH A TANGLED UNDERGROWTH OF BUSH THAT HAS DEFIED FOR TWO GENERATIONS ALL ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR IT INTO THE FORM OF FIELDS WHY LOOK THAT GREAT SPACE THAT SEEMS TO OPEN OUT
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SALMON SHOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US IF THE BARS ARE LET DOWN ALL AT ONCE TO THE FINANCIAL BANDITTI UNDERSTANDING AND COMMON SENSE MUST GUARD THE GATES
THE WOODS I SAY FOR THE FARMS ARE THINNING OUT AND THE TRACK PLUNGES HERE AND THERE INTO GREAT STRETCHES OF BUSH TALL TAMERACK AND RED SCRUB WILLOW
AND ALWAYS THEY AWAKENED HIM SO THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT THE STARS AGAIN AND TRYING NOT TO THINK IN SPITE OF THE GRIEF IN HIS SOUL THEY WERE PLEASANT DREAMS AS THOUGH SOME GENTLE FORCE WERE AT WORK IN HIM SUBCONSCIOUSLY
YES AND THE BEST TOO THE MOST COMFORTABLE THE MOST RELIABLE THE MOST LUXURIOUS AND THE SPEEDIEST TRAIN THAT EVER TURNED A WHEEL AND THE MOST GENIAL
THERE IS THE BRIDGE ITSELF AND THE LONG ROAR OF THE TRAIN AS IT RUSHES SOUNDING OVER THE TRESTLE WORK THAT RISES ABOVE THE MARSH HEAR THE CLATTER AS WE PASS THE SEMAPHORES AND SWITCH LIGHTS WE MUST BE CLOSE IN NOW
BUT WE CAN NOT BECAUSE EVERYTHING UP HERE IS LOCKED AWAY FROM US I REPEAT THAT ISN'T CONSERVATION IF THEY HAD APPLIED A LITTLE OF IT TO THE SALMON INDUSTRY BUT THEY DIDN'T AND THE SALMON ARE GOING LIKE THE BUFFALO OF THE PLAINS
WATCHING THE EMBERS FLARE UP AND DIE I'M NOT PROUD OF THE STATES HE WENT ON AS IF SPEAKING TO SOMETHING WHICH HE SAW IN THE FLAMES I CAN'T BE AFTER THE RUIN THEIR UNINTELLIGENT PROPAGANDA AND LEGISLATION HAVE BROUGHT UPON ALASKA
BILL AND SAM AS IF THEY WERE ALL ONE FAMILY WHAT IS IT NOW NINE THIRTY AH THEN WE MUST BE NEARING THE TOWN THIS BIG BUSH THAT WE ARE PASSING THROUGH YOU REMEMBER IT SURELY AS THE GREAT SWAMP JUST THIS SIDE OF THE BRIDGE OVER THE OSSAWIPPI
AND THE NEW LIMITED AND THE MARITIME EXPRESS THAT HOLDS THE RECORD OF SIX HUNDRED WHIRLING MILES FROM PARIS TO MARSEILLES BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO THIS THIS MAD CAREER THIS BREAKNECK SPEED THIS THUNDERING ROAR OF THE MARIPOSA LOCAL DRIVING HARD TO ITS HOME
AND THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND CAME DOWN TO REVIEW THEM
WAS BORN IN ENGLAND AND AS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF HIS ANCESTORS IN IRELAND HAD MARRIED OTHER THAN ENGLISH PROTESTANTS AND AS WOLFE'S MOTHER WAS ALSO ENGLISH WE MAY SAY THAT THE VICTOR OF QUEBEC WAS A PURE BRED ENGLISHMAN
WITH TOMORROW ALWAYS THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW WHICH HE HAD PURSUED FOR THIRTY YEARS HE WAS SIXTY JUST A WEEK AGO THIS EVENING HE SAID AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO DOUBT IF HE WOULD REMAIN ON THE BEACH AT CORDOVA MUCH LONGER
TO THE FORCES ASSEMBLING IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT
THE YELLOW FELLOWS WILL COME OUT SOME DAY FROM THAT RUMBLED THE OLD SOUR DOUGH STRIKING HIS PIPE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND AND WHEN THEY DO THEY WON'T COME OVER TO US IN ONES AN TWOS AN THREES BUT IN MILLIONS THAT'S WHAT THE YELLOW FELLOWS WILL DO
ASK YOUR NEIGHBOUR THERE AT THE NEXT TABLE WHETHER THE PARTRIDGE THAT THEY SOMETIMES SERVE TO YOU HERE CAN BE COMPARED FOR A MOMENT TO THE BIRDS THAT HE AND YOU OR HE AND SOME ONE ELSE USED TO SHOOT AS BOYS IN THE SPRUCE THICKETS ALONG THE LAKE
HE CURSED COSSACK LAW AND THE PROHIBITORY MEASURES TO KEEP AMERICANS OUT MORE GOLD WAS OVER THERE THAN HAD EVER BEEN DREAMED OF IN ALASKA EVEN THE MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS WERE UNNAMED AND HE WAS GOING IF HE LIVED ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
THUNDERING AND POUNDING TOWARDS THE NORTH WITH HEMLOCK SPARKS POURING OUT INTO THE DARKNESS FROM THE FUNNEL OF IT OF COURSE YOU CAN'T TELL IT JUST AT FIRST ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE CROWDING INTO IT WITH GOLF CLUBS AND WEARING KNICKERBOCKERS AND FLAT CAPS WOULD DECEIVE ANYBODY
PERHAPS IF YOU HAD COME BACK NOW AND AGAIN JUST AT ODD TIMES IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO THERE YOU HEAR IT
BUT IF YOU HAVE HALF FORGOTTEN MARIPOSA AND LONG SINCE LOST THE WAY TO IT YOU ARE ONLY LIKE THE GREATER PART OF THE MEN HERE IN THIS MAUSOLEUM CLUB IN THE CITY WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT THAT PRACTICALLY EVERY ONE OF THEM CAME FROM MARIPOSA ONCE UPON A TIME
FACE THE TRAGIC REALIZATION OF WHAT ALASKA COULD HAVE MEANT TO THE NATION
THAT DULL RESERVE THAT SEEMED TO HOLD THE PASSENGERS IN THE ELECTRIC SUBURBAN HAS CLEAN VANISHED AND GONE THEY ARE TALKING LISTEN OF THE HARVEST AND THE LATE ELECTION AND OF HOW THE LOCAL MEMBER IS MENTIONED FOR THE CABINET AND ALL THE OLD FAMILIAR TOPICS OF THE SORT
SIBERIA WAS DRAGGING HIM THAT FORBIDDEN WORLD OF ADVENTURE AND MYSTERY AND MONUMENTAL OPPORTUNITY WHICH LAY ONLY A FEW MILES ACROSS THE STRAIT FROM THE SEWARD PENINSULA IN HIS ENTHUSIASM HE FORGOT ALAN'S TRAGEDY
THE DISTURBING SOMETHING WHICH HIS MIND HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BUILT UP BUT THE NEW ALAN REVOLTED HE WANTED TO CARRY THE THING AWAY WITH HIM HE WANTED IT TO LIVE AND SO IT WENT WITH HIM UNCONTAMINATED BY ANY TRUTHS OR LIES
LIKE A SMOLDERING CLOUD BUT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE DANGER HE SAID IT WON'T COME FROM JAPAN TO CALIFORNIA IT WILL POUR LIKE A FLOOD THROUGH SIBERIA AND JUMP TO ALASKA IN A NIGHT IT ISN'T THE DANGER OF THE YELLOW MAN ALONE OLAF
BUT SINCE SUCH TREATMENT GIVES A TOTALLY FALSE IDEA OF HIS ACHIEVEMENT THIS LITTLE SKETCH DRAWN STRAIGHT FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES TRIES TO SHOW HIM AS HE REALLY WAS A CO WORKER WITH THE BRITISH FLEET IN A WAR BASED ENTIRELY ON NAVAL STRATEGY
MARIPOSA PEOPLE OH YES THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF THEM ON THE TRAIN EVERY DAY BUT OF COURSE YOU HARDLY RECOGNIZE THEM WHILE THE TRAIN IS STILL PASSING THROUGH THE SUBURBS
J WOLFE TO MISSUS WOLFE AT HER HOUSE IN GREENWICH KENT WOLFE'S VERY GOOD STATE OF HEALTH WAS NOT LIKELY TO CONTINUE SO EITHER IN CAMP OR ON BOARD SHIP
FOUGHT IN EGYPT FOR QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE MEMBER OF IT WHO REPRESENTED WOLFE ON THAT OCCASION IN THE PAGEANT OF THE QUEBEC CAMPAIGN
MANY OF HIS ANCESTORS HAD STOOD READY TO FIGHT FOR KING AND COUNTRY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE HIS FATHER FOUGHT UNDER THE GREAT DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH IN THE WAR AGAINST FRANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HIS GRANDFATHER HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER HIS ONLY UNCLE
AND SMILED GRIMLY INTO OLAF'S BEARDED FACE THEN WE CAN COUNT ON THAT THING COMING ACROSS THE NECK OF SEA FROM THE GULF OF ANADYR HE FINISHED AND IF IT EVER DOES COME THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES WILL AT LAST
YOU USED TO WANDER DOWN TO THE STATION ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AFTER YOUR WORK AND WATCH THE MARIPOSA PEOPLE GETTING ON THE TRAIN AND WISH THAT YOU COULD GO WHY YOU KNEW THAT TRAIN AT ONE TIME BETTER I SUPPOSE THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE THING IN THE CITY
BUT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING EXCEPTIONALLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF DISEASE FOR A SICKLY BOY IN A FAR OFF LAND OF PESTILENCE AND FEVER SHE HAD WRITTEN TO HIM THE VERY DAY HE LEFT
SHIPS WERE FITTING OUT IN ENGLISH HARBOURS SOLDIERS WERE MARCHING INTO EVERY ENGLISH CAMP CROWDS WERE SINGING AND CHEERING FIRST ONE BOY'S FATHER AND THEN ANOTHER'S WAS UNDER ORDERS FOR THE FRONT AMONG THEM WAS WOLFE'S FATHER
YOU'VE GOT TO COMBINE THAT WITH BOLSHEVISM THE MENACE OF BLACKEST RUSSIA A DISEASE WHICH IF IT CROSSES THE LITTLE NECK OF WATER AND GETS HOLD OF ALASKA WILL SHAKE THE AMERICAN CONTINENT TO BED ROCK
SWINGING THE CURVE OF THE EMBANKMENT AT A BREAKNECK SPEED AS IT ROUNDS THE CORNER OF THE LAKE HOW FAST THE TRAIN GOES THIS AUTUMN NIGHT YOU HAVE TRAVELLED I KNOW YOU HAVE IN THE EMPIRE STATE EXPRESS
YOU'D GO BACK HOME AGAIN TO THE LITTLE TOWN AND BUILD A GREAT BIG HOUSE WITH A FINE VERANDAH NO STINT ABOUT IT THE BEST THAT MONEY COULD BUY PLANED LUMBER EVERY SQUARE FOOT OF IT AND A FINE PICKET FENCE IN FRONT OF IT
PRAY MY LOVE TO MY BROTHER PRAY MY SERVICE TO MISTER STRETON AND HIS FAMILY TO MISTER AND MISSUS WESTON AND TO GEORGE WARDE WHEN YOU SEE HIM AND PRAY BELIEVE ME TO BE MY DEAREST MAMMA YOUR MOST DUTIFUL LOVING AND AFFECTIONATE SON
THE PROCURATOR REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AH MADAME COQUENARD ACCEPT MY COMPLIMENTS YOUR DINNER HAS BEEN A REAL FEAST LORD HOW I HAVE EATEN
WE ARE COUSINS IT APPEARS MONSIEUR PORTHOS SAID THE PROCURATOR RISING YET SUPPORTING HIS WEIGHT UPON THE ARMS OF HIS CANE CHAIR THE OLD MAN WRAPPED IN A LARGE BLACK DOUBLET
AND TWICE OR THREE TIMES HE EVEN SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON INTERCEPT THE LIGHT AT LENGTH A HAND AND AN ARM SURPASSINGLY BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR FORM AND WHITENESS GLIDED THROUGH THE TAPESTRY
AND IN WHICH THEIR MAJESTIES WERE TO DANCE THE FAMOUS LA MERLAISON THE FAVORITE BALLET OF THE KING
SMILED A LITTLE AND COLORED A GREAT DEAL
THE TIME FOR WINE CAME
ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR ILLUSTRIOUS GUEST THE QUEEN ENTERED THE GREAT HALL AND IT WAS REMARKED THAT LIKE THE KING SHE LOOKED DULL AND EVEN WEARY AT THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED THE CURTAIN OF A SMALL GALLERY WHICH TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN CLOSED
BUT WITHDRAWING HIS ANXIOUS LOOK FROM THE CHEST AND FIXING IT UPON PORTHOS HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING MONSIEUR OUR COUSIN WILL DO US THE FAVOR OF DINING WITH US ONCE BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE FOR THE CAMPAIGN WILL HE NOT MADAME COQUENARD
THEN CONTINUED HE THERE IS A HORSE FOR MY LACKEY AND MY VALISE
TAKE MY ADVICE DON'T TOUCH THEM DEVIL TAKE ME IF I TASTE ONE OF THEM MURMURED PORTHOS TO HIMSELF AND THEN SAID ALOUD THANK YOU MY COUSIN I AM NO LONGER HUNGRY THERE WAS SILENCE PORTHOS COULD HARDLY KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE
THE KING THE QUEEN HIS EMINENCE AND HIMSELF THE QUEEN HAD JUST REGAINED HER CHAMBER AND D'ARTAGNAN WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE WHEN HE FELT HIS SHOULDER LIGHTLY TOUCHED HE TURNED AND SAW A YOUNG WOMAN WHO MADE HIM A SIGN TO FOLLOW HER
THIS IS FINE SAID PORTHOS TO HIMSELF I AM PRETTILY CAUGHT
THAT AT FIRST SIGHT ONE MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED TO HAVE SOME MEAT ON THEM PRETENDED TO SHOW THEMSELVES BUT THE CLERKS WERE NOT THE DUPES OF THIS DECEIT AND THEIR LUGUBRIOUS LOOKS SETTLED DOWN INTO RESIGNED COUNTENANCES
THE BLACK FEET OF THE FOWL AND THE ONLY MUTTON BONE ON WHICH THERE WAS THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF MEAT PORTHOS FANCIED THEY WERE MYSTIFYING HIM AND BEGAN TO CURL HIS MUSTACHE AND KNIT HIS EYEBROWS
A PRIVATE ROOM HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE KING AND ANOTHER FOR MONSIEUR
TO WHOM ANNE OF AUSTRIA OWED THE EXTRAORDINARY TRIUMPH SHE HAD OBTAINED OVER THE CARDINAL AND WHO CONFOUNDED UNKNOWN LOST IN THE CROWD GATHERED AT ONE OF THE DOORS
WAS DRAWN AND THE PALE FACE OF THE CARDINAL APPEARED HE BEING DRESSED AS A SPANISH CAVALIER HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THOSE OF THE QUEEN AND A SMILE OF TERRIBLE JOY PASSED OVER HIS LIPS THE QUEEN DID NOT WEAR HER DIAMOND STUDS
WHY MADAME HAVE YOU NOT THOUGHT PROPER TO WEAR YOUR DIAMOND STUDS WHEN YOU KNOW IT WOULD GIVE ME SO MUCH GRATIFICATION THE QUEEN CAST A GLANCE AROUND HER AND SAW THE CARDINAL BEHIND WITH A DIABOLICAL SMILE ON HIS COUNTENANCE
AND UPON A SIGN FROM HER EVERYONE EAGERLY TOOK HIS SEAT
THE VOICE OF THE KING WAS TREMULOUS WITH ANGER EVERYBODY LOOKED AND LISTENED WITH ASTONISHMENT COMPREHENDING NOTHING OF WHAT PASSED SIRE SAID THE QUEEN
SERVED HIMSELF IN ABOUT THE SAME PROPORTION
THAT WE MUST ENTREAT HIM TO GIVE US EVERY INSTANT HE CAN CALL HIS OWN PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE OH MY LEGS MY POOR LEGS WHERE ARE YOU MURMURED COQUENARD AND HE TRIED TO SMILE
PORTHOS MADE A MOST SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE
A NOTE WHICH YOU WILL FIND AT HOME WILL TELL YOU BEGONE BEGONE AT THESE WORDS SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE CORRIDOR AND PUSHED D'ARTAGNAN OUT OF THE ROOM D'ARTAGNAN OBEYED LIKE A CHILD WITHOUT THE LEAST RESISTANCE OR OBJECTION
BUT OF WHAT THEN DOES THE EQUIPMENT OF YOUR COMPANY CONSIST MONSIEUR PORTHOS OH OF MANY THINGS SAID PORTHOS THE MUSKETEERS ARE AS YOU KNOW PICKED SOLDIERS
THAT IS WHAT YOU MEANT TO SAY YES DEAR MONSIEUR PORTHOS THUS FOR INSTANCE DON'T YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE WANT A HORSE YES A HORSE WELL THEN I CAN JUST SUIT YOU AH SAID PORTHOS BRIGHTENING
BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE SAW NOTHING BUT EAGER EYES WHICH WERE DEVOURING IN ANTICIPATION THAT SUBLIME FOWL WHICH WAS THE OBJECT OF HIS CONTEMPT
LITTERED WITH PAPERS ON QUITTING THE STUDY THEY LEFT THE KITCHEN ON THE RIGHT AND ENTERED THE RECEPTION ROOM ALL THESE ROOMS WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH ONE ANOTHER DID NOT INSPIRE PORTHOS FAVORABLY WORDS MIGHT BE HEARD AT A DISTANCE THROUGH ALL THESE OPEN DOORS
THE HASTE WHICH THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS IN TO CONVEY TO THE QUEEN THE EXCELLENT NEWS OF THE HAPPY RETURN OF HER MESSENGER PREVENTED THE TWO LOVERS FROM EXCHANGING MORE THAN A FEW WORDS
AND WHICH FORBADE HIM EVEN TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST COMPLAINT AT LENGTH AFTER WINDING ABOUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
WHOM PORTHOS ASSISTED IN ROLLING HER HUSBAND UP TO THE TABLE
THESE CONDITIONS BEING AGREED TO
THE FACE OF THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS COVERED WITH A BLACK VELVET MASK BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS PRECAUTION WHICH WAS IN FACT TAKEN RATHER AGAINST OTHERS THAN AGAINST HIM HE AT ONCE RECOGNIZED HIS USUAL GUIDE THE LIGHT AND INTELLIGENT
EACH HOLDING A FLAMBEAU IN HIS HAND WENT TO ATTEND UPON THE KING WHOM THEY MET ON THE STEPS WHERE THE PROVOST OF THE MERCHANTS MADE HIM THE SPEECH OF WELCOME A COMPLIMENT TO WHICH HIS MAJESTY REPLIED WITH AN APOLOGY FOR COMING SO LATE
BE SATISFIED SAID THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE THERE REMAINS THE VALISE ADDED PORTHOS
AN ILL SMELLING DARK PASSAGE A STAIRCASE HALF LIGHTED BY BARS THROUGH WHICH STOLE A GLIMMER FROM A NEIGHBORING YARD ON THE FIRST FLOOR A LOW DOOR STUDDED WITH ENORMOUS NAILS
AND WHICH WERE ALL ILLUMINATED WITH COLORED LANTERNS
THEY AROSE SLOWLY FROM THE TABLE FOLDED THEIR NAPKINS MORE SLOWLY STILL BOWED AND RETIRED GO YOUNG MEN GO AND PROMOTE DIGESTION BY WORKING SAID THE PROCURATOR GRAVELY
D'ARTAGNAN AT ONCE COMPREHENDED THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE HE CAST HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES SEIZED THE HAND AND TOUCHED IT RESPECTFULLY WITH HIS LIPS
CUT OFF THE NECK WHICH WITH THE HEAD SHE PUT ON ONE SIDE FOR HERSELF RAISED THE WING FOR PORTHOS AND THEN RETURNED THE BIRD OTHERWISE INTACT TO THE SERVANT WHO HAD BROUGHT IT IN
ON THE SURFACE OF WHICH A FEW CRUSTS SWAM ABOUT AS RARE AS THE ISLANDS OF AN ARCHIPELAGO
TO WHICH IT HAD RETIRED TO DIE OF OLD AGE THE DEVIL THOUGHT PORTHOS THIS IS POOR WORK I RESPECT OLD AGE BUT I DON'T MUCH LIKE IT BOILED OR ROASTED
THIS SUCCOR WHICH CAME TO PORTHOS AT THE MOMENT IN WHICH HE WAS ATTACKED IN HIS GASTRONOMIC HOPES INSPIRED MUCH GRATITUDE IN THE MUSKETEER TOWARD THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE THE HOUR OF DINNER SOON ARRIVED
AND THEY REQUIRE MANY THINGS USELESS TO THE GUARDSMEN OR THE SWISS BUT YET DETAIL THEM TO ME WHY THEY MAY AMOUNT TO SAID PORTHOS WHO PREFERRED DISCUSSING THE TOTAL TO TAKING THEM ONE BY ONE
THESE KEYS WERE GIVEN UP TO HIM INSTANTLY EACH OF THEM HAD TICKET ATTACHED TO IT BY WHICH IT MIGHT BE RECOGNIZED AND FROM THAT MOMENT THE SIEUR DE LA COSTE WAS CHARGED WITH THE CARE OF ALL THE DOORS AND ALL THE AVENUES
FREQUENTLY CAST HIS EYES WITH GREAT UNEASINESS UPON A LARGE CHEST PLACED IN FRONT OF HIS OAK DESK PORTHOS COMPREHENDED THAT THIS CHEST ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT CORRESPOND IN SHAPE WITH THAT WHICH HE HAD SEEN IN HIS DREAMS MUST BE THE BLESSED COFFER
AND TWENTY VIOLINS WERE ORDERED AND THE PRICE FOR THEM FIXED AT DOUBLE THE USUAL RATE UPON CONDITION SAID THE REPORT THAT THEY SHOULD BE PLAYED ALL NIGHT
WHICH WAS ENTIRELY DARK AND LED D'ARTAGNAN INTO IT THERE SHE MADE A FRESH SIGN OF SILENCE AND OPENED A SECOND DOOR CONCEALED BY TAPESTRY THE OPENING OF THIS DOOR DISCLOSED A BRILLIANT LIGHT AND SHE DISAPPEARED
AND MONSIEUR AND THE OTHER NOBLES WERE DRESSED LIKE HIM THIS WAS THE COSTUME THAT BEST BECAME THE KING SO DRESSED HE REALLY APPEARED THE FIRST GENTLEMAN OF HIS KINGDOM
IT IS MY COUSIN CRIED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE COME IN COME IN MONSIEUR PORTHOS THE NAME OF PORTHOS PRODUCED ITS EFFECT UPON THE CLERKS WHO BEGAN TO LAUGH BUT PORTHOS TURNED SHARPLY ROUND
TO THE SHAME OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE AND HIS OWN REGRET THAT HE DID NOT SEE THAT FIRE THAT ANIMATION THAT BUSTLE WHICH WHEN A GOOD REPAST IS ON FOOT PREVAILS GENERALLY IN THAT SANCTUARY OF GOOD LIVING
OH OH SAID HE HERE IS A SOUP WHICH IS RATHER INVITING WHAT THE DEVIL CAN THEY SMELL SO EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS SOUP SAID PORTHOS AT THE SIGHT OF A PALE LIQUID ABUNDANT BUT ENTIRELY FREE FROM MEAT
MY HUSBAND HAS FIVE OR SIX VALISES YOU SHALL CHOOSE THE BEST THERE IS ONE IN PARTICULAR WHICH HE PREFERS IN HIS JOURNEYS LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL THE WORLD YOUR VALISE IS THEN EMPTY ASKED PORTHOS WITH SIMPLICITY
ON THE EVENING BEFORE THEY HAD SCARCELY SEEN EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT AT THE APARTMENT OF THE SWISS GUARD GERMAIN WHITHER D'ARTAGNAN HAD SENT FOR HER
THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE WAITED TREMBLINGLY TO HOW MUCH SAID SHE I HOPE IT DOES NOT EXCEED SHE STOPPED
YOU AT LAST CRIED D'ARTAGNAN SILENCE SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN PLACING HER HAND UPON HIS LIPS SILENCE AND GO THE SAME WAY YOU CAME BUT WHERE AND WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN CRIED D'ARTAGNAN
HIS HEART BEAT BUT NOT LIKE D'ARTAGNAN'S WITH A YOUNG AND IMPATIENT LOVE NO A MORE MATERIAL INTEREST STIRRED HIS BLOOD HE WAS ABOUT AT LAST TO PASS THAT MYSTERIOUS THRESHOLD
AND YET AT THE VERY DOOR THE MUSKETEER BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN SOME DOUBTS THE APPROACH WAS NOT SUCH AS TO PREPOSSESS PEOPLE
YES MONSIEUR WE ARE COUSINS SAID PORTHOS WITHOUT BEING DISCONCERTED AS HE HAD NEVER RECKONED UPON BEING RECEIVED ENTHUSIASTICALLY BY THE HUSBAND BY THE FEMALE SIDE I BELIEVE SAID THE PROCURATOR MALICIOUSLY
AH MADAME SAID PORTHOS HAUGHTILY DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A BEGGAR NO
THIS TIME PORTHOS RECEIVED THE BLOW RIGHT IN HIS STOMACH AND FELT IT
AND THE WORD MAJESTY SEVERAL TIMES REPEATED INDICATED CLEARLY THAT HE WAS IN A CLOSET ATTACHED TO THE QUEEN'S APARTMENT THE YOUNG MAN WAITED IN COMPARATIVE DARKNESS AND LISTENED THE QUEEN APPEARED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY
I WISHED TO KNOW THE DETAIL SAID SHE BECAUSE HAVING MANY RELATIVES IN BUSINESS I WAS ALMOST SURE OF OBTAINING THINGS AT A HUNDRED PER CENT LESS THAN YOU WOULD PAY YOURSELF AH AH SAID PORTHOS
PORTHOS DID NOT FEEL THE RIDICULE OF THIS AND TOOK IT FOR A PIECE OF SIMPLICITY AT WHICH HE LAUGHED IN HIS LARGE MUSTACHE
ENSIGN IN THE KING'S GUARDS FOLLOWED BY TWO OFFICERS AND SEVERAL ARCHERS OF THAT BODY CAME TO THE CITY REGISTRAR NAMED CLEMENT AND DEMANDED OF HIM ALL THE KEYS OF THE ROOMS AND OFFICES OF THE HOTEL
A SURTOUT OF GRAY PEARL VELVET FASTENED WITH DIAMOND CLASPS AND A PETTICOAT OF BLUE SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH SILVER ON HER LEFT SHOULDER SPARKLED THE DIAMOND STUDS ON A BOW OF THE SAME COLOR AS THE PLUMES AND THE PETTICOAT
AH BUT THE VALISE I WANT CRIED PORTHOS IS A WELL FILLED ONE MY DEAR MADAME UTTERED FRESH SIGHS MOLIERE HAD NOT WRITTEN HIS SCENE IN L'AVARE THEN
OH NO SAID PORTHOS IT DOES NOT EXCEED TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LIVRES I EVEN THINK THAT WITH ECONOMY I COULD MANAGE IT WITH TWO THOUSAND LIVRES GOOD GOD CRIED SHE TWO THOUSAND LIVRES
THEN THE HAND WAS WITHDRAWN LEAVING IN HIS AN OBJECT WHICH HE PERCEIVED TO BE A RING THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY CLOSED AND D'ARTAGNAN FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN IN COMPLETE OBSCURITY D'ARTAGNAN PLACED THE RING ON HIS FINGER AND AGAIN WAITED
A STRIPLING OF A DOZEN YEARS RISING BEHIND THE THIRD IN ALL THREE CLERKS AND A HALF WHICH FOR THE TIME ARGUED A VERY EXTENSIVE CLIENTAGE ALTHOUGH THE MUSKETEER WAS NOT EXPECTED BEFORE ONE O'CLOCK
FELT THE WANT OF A SIESTA PORTHOS BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THE THING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE PRESENT SITTING AND IN THAT SAME LOCALITY BUT THE PROCURATOR WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING HE WOULD BE TAKEN TO HIS ROOM
I CAN SEND FOR THEM TO THE LOUVRE WHERE THEY ARE AND THUS YOUR MAJESTY'S WISHES WILL BE COMPLIED WITH DO SO MADAME DO SO AND THAT AT ONCE FOR WITHIN AN HOUR THE BALLET WILL COMMENCE THE QUEEN BENT IN TOKEN OF SUBMISSION
UPON THE EDGE OF WHICH FOR STILL GREATER PRECAUTION HE PLACED HIS FEET THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE TOOK PORTHOS INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM AND THEY BEGAN TO LAY THE BASIS OF A RECONCILIATION YOU CAN COME AND DINE THREE TIMES A WEEK
AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM UNCLOSED WITH A CREAK AND PORTHOS PERCEIVED THROUGH THE HALF OPEN FLAP THE LITTLE CLERK WHO NOT BEING ALLOWED TO TAKE PART IN THE FEAST ATE HIS DRY BREAD IN THE PASSAGE WITH THE DOUBLE ODOR OF THE DINING ROOM AND KITCHEN
THE QUEEN HAD THEM THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HAD SHE TEN OR TWELVE AT THAT MOMENT THE VIOLINS SOUNDED THE SIGNAL FOR THE BALLET THE KING ADVANCED TOWARD MADAME THE PRESIDENT WITH WHOM HE WAS TO DANCE
PORTHOS LOOKED AT THE BOTTLE WHICH WAS NEAR HIM AND HOPED THAT WITH WINE BREAD AND CHEESE HE MIGHT MAKE A DINNER BUT WINE WAS WANTING THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTY
THE LATTER WISHED TO DETAIN HIM BY DARTING CERTAIN TENDER GLANCES BUT PORTHOS URGED THE COMMANDS OF DUTY AND THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE PLACE TO THE KING
YOU ARE CERTAINLY TREATING YOUR COUSIN VERY HANDSOMELY THE POOR FOWL WAS THIN AND COVERED WITH ONE OF THOSE THICK BRISTLY SKINS THROUGH WHICH THE TEETH CANNOT PENETRATE WITH ALL THEIR EFFORTS THE FOWL MUST HAVE BEEN SOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME ON THE PERCH
WITH THESE WORDS HE HELD OUT TO THE QUEEN THE TWO STUDS THE CARDINAL HAD GIVEN HIM HOW SIRE CRIED THE YOUNG QUEEN AFFECTING SURPRISE YOU ARE GIVING ME THEN TWO MORE I SHALL HAVE FOURTEEN
LAYING THE BLAME UPON THE CARDINAL WHO HAD DETAINED HIM TILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK TALKING OF AFFAIRS OF STATE HIS MAJESTY IN FULL DRESS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
OUT OF RESPECT WITHDREW SEVERAL STEPS SO THAT NOBODY HAD HEARD ANYTHING THE VIOLINS BEGAN TO SOUND WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT BUT NOBODY LISTENED TO THEM THE KING CAME OUT FIRST FROM HIS ROOM HE WAS IN A MOST ELEGANT HUNTING COSTUME
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT ALL WAS NOT YET OVER AFTER THE REWARD OF HIS DEVOTION THAT OF HIS LOVE WAS TO COME BESIDES ALTHOUGH THE BALLET WAS DANCED THE EVENING HAD SCARCELY BEGUN SUPPER WAS TO BE SERVED AT THREE
PORTHOS KNOCKED WITH HIS HAND A TALL PALE CLERK HIS FACE SHADED BY A FOREST OF VIRGIN HAIR OPENED THE DOOR AND BOWED WITH THE AIR OF A MAN FORCED AT ONCE TO RESPECT IN ANOTHER LOFTY STATURE WHICH INDICATED STRENGTH
IN WHICH THE WHOLE OF HIS SLENDER BODY WAS CONCEALED WAS BRISK AND DRY HIS LITTLE GRAY EYES SHONE LIKE CARBUNCLES AND APPEARED WITH HIS GRINNING MOUTH TO BE THE ONLY PART OF HIS FACE IN WHICH LIFE SURVIVED
AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORTHY LADY RELIEVED HIM FROM AN AWKWARD EMBARRASSMENT THE CLERKS SURVEYED HIM WITH GREAT CURIOSITY AND HE NOT KNOWING WELL WHAT TO SAY TO THIS ASCENDING AND DESCENDING SCALE REMAINED TONGUE TIED
A PROCURATOR'S DINNER HOWEVER BRILLIANT HAD BEEN THE PART PLAYED BY PORTHOS IN THE DUEL IT HAD NOT MADE HIM FORGET THE DINNER OF THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE ON THE MORROW HE RECEIVED THE LAST TOUCHES OF MOUSQUETON'S BRUSH FOR AN HOUR
AND TOOK FROM A BUFFET A PIECE OF CHEESE SOME PRESERVED QUINCES AND A CAKE WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF MADE OF ALMONDS AND HONEY
HE SOON DISTINGUISHED HER VOICE FROM THE OTHERS AT FIRST BY A SLIGHTLY FOREIGN ACCENT AND NEXT BY THAT TONE OF DOMINATION NATURALLY IMPRESSED UPON ALL ROYAL WORDS HE HEARD HER APPROACH AND WITHDRAW FROM THE PARTIALLY OPEN DOOR
AS IT CAME IN SEARCH OF HIS HE ALSO DRANK HALF A GLASS OF THIS SPARINGLY SERVED WINE AND FOUND IT TO BE NOTHING BUT THAT HORRIBLE MONTREUIL THE TERROR OF ALL EXPERT PALATES
IN THEIR UTMOST NICETY AND WINNING FROM THEM BY WAY OF FEE FOR THE LESSON HE WOULD GIVE THEM IN AN HOUR THEIR SAVINGS OF A MONTH ALL THIS WAS ENORMOUSLY DELIGHTFUL TO PORTHOS
THE MUSKETEER COULD NOT FORGET THE EVIL REPORTS WHICH THEN PREVAILED AND WHICH INDEED HAVE SURVIVED THEM OF THE PROCURATORS OF THE PERIOD MEANNESS STINGINESS FASTS BUT AS AFTER ALL
THE YOUNG MEN FILLED UP THEIR THIRD OF A GLASS WITH WATER THEN WHEN THEY HAD DRUNK HALF THE GLASS THEY FILLED IT UP AGAIN AND CONTINUED TO DO SO THIS BROUGHT THEM BY THE END OF THE REPAST TO SWALLOWING A DRINK
AFTER THE SOUP THE MAID BROUGHT A BOILED FOWL A PIECE OF MAGNIFICENCE WHICH CAUSED THE EYES OF THE DINERS TO DILATE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY SEEMED READY TO BURST
BUT THE KING TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE PRIVILEGE HE HAD OF LEAVING HIS LADY TO ADVANCE EAGERLY TOWARD THE QUEEN I THANK YOU MADAME SAID HE FOR THE DEFERENCE YOU HAVE SHOWN TO MY WISHES BUT I THINK YOU WANT TWO OF THE STUDS AND I BRING THEM BACK TO YOU
PORTHOS SMILED IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD THE SADDLE WHICH CAME FROM BUCKINGHAM
MOVED BY A DOUBLE SENTIMENT LOVE AND CURIOSITY ALL THE WAY AND IN PROPORTION AS THE CORRIDORS BECAME MORE DESERTED D'ARTAGNAN WISHED TO STOP THE YOUNG WOMAN SEIZE HER AND GAZE UPON HER WERE IT ONLY FOR A MINUTE
AND HELD THEIR STOOLS IN HAND QUITE READY TO SIT DOWN THEIR JAWS MOVED PRELIMINARILY WITH FEARFUL THREATENINGS INDEED THOUGHT PORTHOS CASTING A GLANCE AT THE THREE HUNGRY CLERKS
NOW SAID HE THE SACRIFICE IS CONSUMMATED AH IF I HAD NOT THE HOPE OF PEEPING WITH MADAME COQUENARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S CHEST
FOR THE ERRAND BOY AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED WAS NOT ADMITTED TO THE HONORS OF THE MAGISTERIAL TABLE IN MY COUSIN'S PLACE I WOULD NOT KEEP SUCH GOURMANDS THEY LOOK LIKE SHIPWRECKED SAILORS WHO HAVE NOT EATEN FOR SIX WEEKS
AS NEXT TO THE QUEEN SHE WAS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PERSONAGE OF THE FETE SHE WAS RECEIVED BY THE CITY OFFICIALS AND PLACED IN A BOX OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH THE QUEEN WAS TO OCCUPY AT TEN O'CLOCK THE KING'S COLLATION CONSISTING OF PRESERVES AND OTHER DELICACIES
PORTHOS BIT HIS LIPS BECAUSE HE SAW NOT THE WHEREWITHAL TO DINE HE LOOKED TO SEE IF THE DISH OF BEANS WAS STILL THERE THE DISH OF BEANS HAD DISAPPEARED
THEY PASSED INTO THE EATING ROOM A LARGE DARK ROOM SITUATED OPPOSITE THE KITCHEN THE CLERKS WHO AS IT APPEARED HAD SMELLED UNUSUAL PERFUMES IN THE HOUSE WERE OF MILITARY PUNCTUALITY
HE WAS ABOUT TO SEE IN REALITY A CERTAIN COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD TWENTY TIMES BEHELD THE IMAGE IN HIS DREAMS A COFFER LONG AND DEEP LOCKED BOLTED FASTENED IN THE WALL A COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN HEARD
THE KING OPENED IT AND FOUND IN IT TWO DIAMOND STUDS WHAT DOES THIS MEAN DEMANDED HE OF THE CARDINAL NOTHING REPLIED THE LATTER ONLY IF THE QUEEN HAS THE STUDS WHICH I VERY MUCH DOUBT COUNT THEM SIRE
WHICH SEEMED TO ASTONISH THE PERSONS WHO SURROUNDED HER AND WHO WERE ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HER ALMOST ALWAYS SAD AND FULL OF CARE THE QUEEN ATTRIBUTED THIS JOYOUS FEELING TO THE BEAUTY OF THE FETE
THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE HAD BEEN ON THE WATCH EVER SINCE MIDDAY RECKONING THAT THE HEART OR PERHAPS THE STOMACH OF HER LOVER WOULD BRING HIM BEFORE HIS TIME
ON HIS PART THE KING RETURNED TO HIS APARTMENT THERE WAS A MOMENT OF TROUBLE AND CONFUSION IN THE ASSEMBLY EVERYBODY HAD REMARKED THAT SOMETHING HAD PASSED BETWEEN THE KING AND QUEEN BUT BOTH OF THEM HAD SPOKEN SO LOW THAT EVERYBODY
IN FACT THE KING COUNTED THEM AND THE TWELVE STUDS WERE ALL ON HER MAJESTY'S SHOULDER THE KING CALLED THE CARDINAL WHAT DOES THIS MEAN MONSIEUR CARDINAL ASKED THE KING IN A SEVERE TONE THIS MEANS SIRE REPLIED THE CARDINAL
THE SAME HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE QUEEN AND MADAME THE PRESIDENT THE NOBLES AND LADIES OF THEIR MAJESTIES SUITES WERE TO DRESS TWO BY TWO IN CHAMBERS PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE
BUT QUICK AS A BIRD SHE GLIDED BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND WHEN HE WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER HER FINGER PLACED UPON HER MOUTH WITH A LITTLE IMPERATIVE GESTURE FULL OF GRACE REMINDED HIM THAT HE WAS UNDER THE COMMAND OF A POWER WHICH HE MUST BLINDLY OBEY
WELL AGREED FOR A PRETTY MULE SAID PORTHOS YOU ARE RIGHT I HAVE SEEN VERY GREAT SPANISH NOBLES WHOSE WHOLE SUITE WERE MOUNTED ON MULES BUT THEN YOU UNDERSTAND MADAME COQUENARD A MULE WITH FEATHERS AND BELLS
THE QUEEN REMAINED FOR A SHORT TIME TO RECEIVE THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE CITY DIGNITARIES AND TO REPLY TO THE SALUTATIONS OF THE LADIES ALL AT ONCE THE KING APPEARED WITH THE CARDINAL AT ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE HALL
AT SIX IN THE EVENING THE GUESTS BEGAN TO COME AS FAST AS THEY ENTERED THEY WERE PLACED IN THE GRAND SALOON ON THE PLATFORMS PREPARED FOR THEM AT NINE O'CLOCK MADAME LA PREMIERE PRESIDENTE ARRIVED
AND THE CLOCK OF SAINT JEAN HAD STRUCK THREE QUARTERS PAST TWO THE SOUND OF VOICES DIMINISHED BY DEGREES IN THE ADJOINING CHAMBER THE COMPANY WAS THEN HEARD DEPARTING THEN THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET IN WHICH D'ARTAGNAN WAS WAS OPENED
FINALLY THE REST OF THE EQUIPMENT WAS SUCCESSIVELY DEBATED IN THE SAME MANNER
AND HIS HIGHNESS MONSIEUR WITH THE QUEEN THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND THE BALLET BEGAN THE KING DANCED FACING THE QUEEN AND EVERY TIME HE PASSED BY HER HE DEVOURED WITH HIS EYES THOSE STUDS OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ASCERTAIN THE NUMBER
THE MILITARY DRESS WHICH INDICATED RANK AND A RUDDY COUNTENANCE WHICH INDICATED FAMILIARITY WITH GOOD LIVING A SHORTER CLERK CAME BEHIND THE FIRST A TALLER CLERK BEHIND THE SECOND
WAS PREPARED IN THE LITTLE ROOM ON THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT JEAN IN FRONT OF THE SILVER BUFFET OF THE CITY WHICH WAS GUARDED BY FOUR ARCHERS AT MIDNIGHT GREAT CRIES AND LOUD ACCLAMATIONS WERE HEARD IT WAS THE KING
A HORSE FOR YOUR LACKEY RESUMED THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE HESITATINGLY
TO SMOOTH THE YELLOW WRINKLED BROW OF THE OLD PROCURATOR
THE PROCURATOR HAD WITHOUT DOUBT BEEN WARNED OF HIS VISIT AS HE EXPRESSED NO SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF PORTHOS WHO ADVANCED TOWARD HIM WITH A SUFFICIENTLY EASY AIR AND SALUTED HIM COURTEOUSLY
THE KING TREMBLED WITH JOY AND THE CARDINAL WITH VEXATION
BEFORE ENTERING HIS CLOSET THE KING DESIRED TO BE INFORMED THE MOMENT THE CARDINAL ARRIVED HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE ENTRANCE OF THE KING FRESH ACCLAMATIONS WERE HEARD THESE ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF THE QUEEN
THE CITY CARPENTERS HAD ERECTED SCAFFOLDS UPON WHICH THE INVITED LADIES WERE TO BE PLACED THE CITY GROCER HAD ORNAMENTED THE CHAMBERS WITH TWO HUNDRED FLAMBEAUX OF WHITE WAX A PIECE OF LUXURY UNHEARD OF AT THAT PERIOD
BUT SOON A RAY OF LIGHT WHICH PENETRATED THROUGH THE CHAMBER TOGETHER WITH THE WARM AND PERFUMED AIR WHICH REACHED HIM FROM THE SAME APERTURE THE CONVERSATION OF TWO OF THREE LADIES IN LANGUAGE AT ONCE RESPECTFUL AND REFINED
THE CARDINAL WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE AND THE KING WAS VERY PALE THE KING MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD WITHOUT A MASK AND THE RIBBONS OF HIS DOUBLET SCARCELY TIED HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE QUEEN AND IN AN ALTERED VOICE SAID
THAT'S WELL AS REGARDS MY HORSE BUT I MUST HAVE THE APPOINTMENTS COMPLETE AS THEY INCLUDE OBJECTS WHICH A MUSKETEER ALONE CAN PURCHASE AND WHICH WILL NOT AMOUNT BESIDES TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED LIVRES
SO HARD SOMETIMES THAT PERCHED ON THE BOX WITH JUST HIS TOES TOUCHING THE GROUND
SENSIBLE TALKING WE ON OUR FEET MUST GO
THE NEXT MORNING DIAMOND WAS UP ALMOST AS EARLY AS BEFORE HE HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FROM HIS MOTHER NOW AND MADE NO SECRET OF WHAT HE WAS ABOUT BY THE TIME HE REACHED THE STABLE SEVERAL OF THE MEN WERE THERE
FAIR ARE GROWN UP PEOPLE'S TREES
AND HUNT FOR HER FOOD AND MAKE CLOTHES FOR HER HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE MOST FORTUNATE OF MEN
WITH THE MOON BEHIND IT I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS THE KELPIE COME AFTER ME FOR IT WAS A TALL WOMAN MY HEART GAVE A GREAT JUMP UP BUT I SWALLOWED IT DOWN
AND THE MORNING BROKEN THERE MY GARDEN GROWS AGAIN GREEN AND ROSY PAINTED AS AT EVE BEHIND THE PANE FROM MY EYES IT FAINTED
I HAD NOT RIDDEN FAR FROM THE STABLE BEFORE I AGAIN FOUND MYSELF
YOUNG DIAMOND JUMPED OFF HIS BOX
THOUGH CLOSER STILL THE BLINDS WE PULL TO KEEP THE SHADY PARLOUR COOL YET HE WILL FIND A CHINK OR TWO TO SLIP HIS GOLDEN FINGERS THROUGH
NOTWITHSTANDING IN FACT I OWED THE GREATER PART OF THE COURAGE I POSSESSED
SHE SAID IN A GRUFF VOICE AS SHE ADVANCED ALONG THE STREAM OF MOONLIGHT I STOOD UP AS BRAVELY AS I COULD IT'S ONLY ME MISS ADAM I SAID AND WHO ARE YOU
BEFORE THEY REACHED THE STREET WHERE MISTER COLEMAN LIVED IT BLEW SO TREMENDOUSLY THAT WHEN MISS COLEMAN WHO WAS GOING OUT A LITTLE WAY OPENED THE DOOR IT DASHED AGAINST THE WALL WITH SUCH A BANG THAT SHE WAS AFRAID TO VENTURE AND WENT IN AGAIN
SPRING AND DAISIES CAME APACE GRASSES HIDE MY HIDING PLACE
TINY WOODS BELOW WHOSE BOUGHS SHADY FAIRIES WEAVE A HOUSE
SO DIAMOND RAN IN AND HAD ANOTHER MOUTHFUL OF TEA AND BREAD AND BUTTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO TIRED AS HE WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE HE STARTED QUITE FRESH THIS MORNING IT WAS A CLOUDY DAY AND THE WIND BLEW HARD FROM THE NORTH
THE MAID COULD NOT BUT REMEMBER DIAMOND HAVING SEEN HIM WHEN HE AND HIS FATHER BROUGHT THE LADIES HOME SO SHE BELIEVED HIM
OLD AND SERIOUS
WHICH HE COULD NOT REFUSE BECAUSE HIS MOTHER WANTED THEM SO MUCH AT HOME FOR HIS FATHER HE LEFT THEM NEARLY AS HAPPY AS THEY WERE THEMSELVES THE REST OF THE DAY HE DID BETTER AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT SO MUCH TO TAKE HOME AS THE DAY BEFORE
THE MOMENT HE CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION HE CHANGED HIS COURSE FROM WESTWARD TO NORTHWARD AND WENT STRAIGHT FOR MISTER COLEMAN'S POOR LITTLE HOUSE IN HOXTON
BETWEEN THE TWO HOWEVER HE DID MAKE A SUCCESS OF IT AFTER THAT FORTNIGHT HIS FATHER WAS ABLE TO GO OUT AGAIN
SO SAYING HE OPENED THE DOOR AND GOT IN AND DIAMOND DROVE AWAY BUT AS HE DROVE HE COULD NOT HELP FANCYING HE HAD SEEN THE GENTLEMAN FOR DIAMOND KNEW HE WAS A GENTLEMAN BEFORE
AND HE'D BETTER GO HOME AGAIN AS FAST AS HE CAN IF JOHN ADAM SHOULD COME OUT I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN OR PERHAPS HE'D LIKE TO STOP AND KEEP YOU COMPANY NO THANK YOU MISS ADAM
THAT'S VERY UNGRATEFUL OF YOU JAMIE I SAID FULL OF MY OWN IMPORTANCE WHEN I'VE COME SO FAR AND ALL AT NIGHT TOO TO SET YOU FREE I'M FREE ENOUGH SAID JAMIE
BUT HE GOT UPON HIS BOX TO ARRANGE HIS THOUGHTS BEFORE MAKING ANY REPLY THE GENTLEMAN WAS MISTER EVANS TO WHOM MISS COLEMAN WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED
I SAID I WILL GO HOME COME ALONG THEN AND LET ME SHUT THE DOOR AFTER YOU SOMEWHAT NETTLED WITH JAMIE DUFF'S INDIFFERENCE TO MY WELL MEANT EXERTIONS ON HIS BEHALF
TELL MISS COLEMAN IT'S MISS COLEMAN HE WANTS TO SEE I DON'T KNOW SAID THE MAID HE DON'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN HE IS THOUGH AND I KNOW HIM AND SO DOES MISS COLEMAN
FOR MY SPEED SEEMED TO DRAW THE TERRORS THE FASTER AFTER ME HAVING DISCOVERED THIS I CHANGED MY PLAN AND WHEN I FELT MORE FRIGHTENED DREW REIN AND WENT SLOWER
AND COLOURED A LITTLE WITH THE MOON'S YELLOWNESS IF I WERE WRITING FOR GROWN PEOPLE I SHOULD TELL THEM THAT THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND THINGS BECAUSE THEY THINK ABOUT THEM AND ASK GOD TO TEACH THEM WALK IN THE SUNLIGHT
BUT AS HE TURNED TO GO BACK SOME IDLERS NOT CONTENT WITH CHAFFING HIM SHOWED A MIND TO THE FARE THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD GIVEN HIM THEY WERE JUST PULLING HIM OFF THE BOX AND DIAMOND WAS SHOUTING FOR THE POLICE WHEN A PALE FACED MAN
SHE GAVE A CRY OF ALARM BUT PRESENTLY OPENED THE DOOR LOOKING PALE AND FRIGHTENED WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT OF DOORS THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT SHE ASKED BUT WITHOUT QUITE HER USUAL ARROGANCE
CHILD AND GARDEN FLOWER AND SUN VANISH ALL THINGS MORTAL AS THE BUILDING SHADOWS FALL AS THE RAYS DIMINISH UNDER EVENING'S CLOAK THEY ALL
GREAT IS THE SUN AND WIDE HE GOES THROUGH EMPTY HEAVEN WITH REPOSE AND IN THE BLUE AND GLOWING DAYS
THE SHADOWS WERE VERY DIFFERENT TOO SOMEHOW THEY WERE LIKER TO THE LIGHT THAT MADE THEM THAN THE SUN SHADOWS ARE TO THE SUNLIGHT BOTH THE LIGHT AND THE SHADOWS OF THE MOON WERE STRANGE AND FEARFUL TO ME
ARE ALL SO STRONG AND SO REAL AND SO FRIENDLY YOU SEEM TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM THEY BELONG TO YOUR HOUSE
I SHALL LET YOUR FATHER KNOW OF YOUR GOINGS ON SHE SAID RECOVERING HERSELF A LITTLE YOU NEED NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE I SHALL TELL HIM MYSELF AT BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE
SHE RETURNED RANALD BANNERMAN I ANSWERED OH SHE SAID IN A PUZZLED TONE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AT THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT
IN THE EAST A BREAKING IN THE HEDGES AND THE WHINS SLEEPING BIRDS A WAKING IN THE DARKNESS SHAPES OF THINGS HOUSES TREES AND HEDGES
I WENT HOME AT A GOOD GALLOP TOOK OFF THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE AND LAID THEM IN A CART IN THE SHED TURNED MISSY LOOSE INTO THE STABLE SHUT THE DOOR AND RAN ACROSS THE FIELD TO THE MANSE
SAID JAMIE THAT'S ONLY BUT ERE HE GOT FARTHER THE MOONLIGHT IN THE LOFT WAS DARKENED I LOOKED HURRIEDLY TOWARDS THE DOOR THERE STOOD THE STRANGEST FIGURE
I CLIMBED THE LADDER AND AFTER SEVERAL FAILURES SUCCEEDED IN FINDING HOW THE DOOR WAS FASTENED WHEN I OPENED IT THE MOONLIGHT GOT IN BEFORE ME
BUT I RODE QUIETLY UP TO THE BACK OF THE YARD WHERE THE RICKS STOOD GOT OFF MISSY AND FASTENED THE BRIDLE TO THE GATE AND WALKED ACROSS TO THE CART SHED WHERE THE MOON WAS SHINING UPON THE LADDER LEADING UP TO THE LOFT
HE WAS FAR TOO SOUND ASLEEP TO BE TROUBLED BY THE RATS FOR SLEEP IS AN ARMOUR YES A CASTLE AGAINST MANY ENEMIES I GOT HOLD OF ONE OF HIS HANDS
WHERE JAMIE WAS LYING ASLEEP WITH A RUG OVER HIM I CROSSED THE FLOOR KNELT DOWN BY HIM AND TRIED TO WAKE HIM THIS WAS NOT SO EASY
AND DID WORK WORTH DOING FOR A FORTNIGHT DIAMOND WENT ON DRIVING HIS CAB AND KEEPING HIS FAMILY HE HAD BEGUN TO BE KNOWN ABOUT SOME PARTS OF LONDON
I WOULD NOT DISGRACE MYSELF BEFORE JAMIE IT WAS NOT THE KELPIE HOWEVER BUT THE KEEPER'S SISTER
GARDEN DARKENED DAISY SHUT CHILD IN BED THEY SLUMBER GLOW WORM IN THE HALLWAY RUT MICE AMONG THE LUMBER
WE SHALL LOOK DOWN ON THE BIRDIES NO LONGER THEY SHALL GO FLYING WITH MUSICAL SPEECHES HIGH OVERHEAD IN THE TOPS OF THE BEECHES IN SPITE OF OUR WISDOM AND
FOR THE ROUGHS WERE IN GREAT FORCE HOWEVER THERE BEING NO BLOCK NOT EVEN IN NIGHTINGALE LANE HE REACHED THE ENTRANCE OF THE WHARF AND SET DOWN HIS PASSENGER WITHOUT ANNOYANCE
IN THE DARKNESS HOUSES SHINE PARENTS MOVE THE CANDLES TILL ON ALL THE NIGHT DIVINE TURNS THE BEDROOM HANDLES TILL AT LAST THE DAY BEGINS
AND HAD NO SUSPICION THEREFORE OF THE CHANGE OF DIRECTION BY THIS TIME THE WIND HAD INCREASED ALMOST TO A HURRICANE AND AS THEY HAD OFTEN TO HEAD IT IT WAS NO JOKE FOR EITHER OF THE DIAMONDS THE DISTANCE HOWEVER WAS NOT GREAT
THE GREY SMOKE TOWERS SING A SONG OF SEASONS SOMETHING BRIGHT IN ALL FLOWERS IN THE SUMMER
JUST AS I SHOULD LIKE TO DO HE HAS SEEN THE STARRY HOURS AND THE SPRINGING OF THE FLOWERS AND THE FAIRY THINGS THAT PASS IN THE FORESTS OF THE GRASS
BUT HE WAS NOT PAST BEING TAUGHT AND HIS TROUBLES HAD DONE HIM NO END OF GOOD FOR THEY HAD MADE HIM DOUBT HIMSELF
I DARED NOT HAVE GONE ON MY OWN TWO LEGS IT WAS NOT THAT I COULD SO EASILY RUN AWAY WITH FOUR INSTEAD BUT THAT SOMEHOW I WAS LIFTED ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL OF FEAR BY BEING UPON HER BACK
AND IT WAS IN A MEASURE THROUGH HIS INFLUENCE THAT HE ENTERED UPON THOSE SPECULATIONS WHICH RUINED HIM SO HIS LOVE HAD NOT BEEN A BLESSING THE SHIP WHICH NORTH WIND HAD SUNK WAS THEIR LAST VENTURE
AND CERTAINLY AS OFTEN AS I DID SO IT ABATED FEAR IS A WORSE THING THAN DANGER I HAD TO PASS VERY NIGH THE POOL TO WHICH TURKEY AND I HAD GONE THE NIGHT OF OUR ADVENTURE WITH BOGBONNY'S BULL
YOUNGER THAN WE ARE O CHILDREN AND FRAILER SOON IN THE BLUE AIR THEY'LL BE SINGER AND SAILOR WE SO MUCH OLDER TALLER AND STRONGER
WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING TO CHARING CROSS BUT I DON'T MIND WHERE I GO WELL I AM VERY TIRED IF YOU WILL TAKE ME TO CHARING CROSS I SHALL BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU I HAVE WALKED FROM GRAVESEND
AND HOW HE HAD DONE AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT THEY ASKED HIM SUCH A MULTITUDE OF QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH HE COULD ANSWER AND SOME OF WHICH HE COULD NOT ANSWER AND HIS FATHER SEEMED EVER SO MUCH BETTER FROM FINDING THAT HIS BOY WAS ALREADY NOT ONLY USEFUL TO HIS FAMILY BUT USEFUL TO OTHER PEOPLE
A CABMAN OUGHT TO BE ABOVE MINDING THE WEATHER AT LEAST SO DIAMOND THOUGHT AT LENGTH HE WAS CALLED TO A NEIGHBOURING HOUSE
HE BARES TO ALL THE GARDEN GROUND AND SHEDS A WARM AND GLITTERING LOOK AMONG THE IVY'S INMOST NOOK ABOVE THE HILLS ALONG THE BLUE
THE GARDENER DOES NOT LOVE TO TALK HE MAKES ME KEEP THE GRAVEL WALK AND WHEN HE PUTS HIS TOOLS AWAY HE LOCKS THE DOOR AND TAKES THE KEY
AND IN LIFTING IT TO PULL HIM UP FOUND A CORD TIED TO HIS WRIST I WAS INDIGNANT
AND OTHERS WHO TAKE THINGS BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE TELL THEM SO ARE ALWAYS WALKING IN THE STRANGE MOONLIGHT
I FOLLOWED HER WITHOUT EVEN BIDDING HIM GOOD NIGHT OH YOU'VE GOT MISSY HAVE YOU SHE SAID SPYING HER WHERE SHE STOOD WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK OF MILK OR A PIECE OF OATCAKE BEFORE YOU GO
WHEN THE LAWN IS SHAVEN CLEAR THEN MY HOLE SHALL REAPPEAR I SHALL FIND HIM NEVER FEAR I SHALL FIND MY GRENADIER
THE DUSTY ATTIC SPIDER CLAD HE THROUGH THE KEYHOLE MAKETH GLAD AND THROUGH THE BROKEN EDGE OF TILES INTO THE LADDERED HAY LOFT SMILES
EVERY BLUSH OF ROSES EVERY BLUE FORGET ME NOT WHERE THE DEW REPOSES UP THEY CRY THE DAY IS COME ON THE SMILING VALLEYS
THERE'S NO HARM IN HIM POOR THING SHE UNDID THE BRIDLE FOR ME HELPED ME TO MOUNT IN THE KINDEST WAY BADE ME GOOD NIGHT AND STOOD LOOKING AFTER ME TILL I WAS SOME DISTANCE OFF
FOR AS JAMIE EXPLAINED TO ME AFTERWARDS THE CORD WHICH WAS TIED TO HIS WRIST INSTEAD OF BEING MEANT TO KEEP HIM A PRISONER WAS A DEVICE OF HER KINDNESS TO KEEP HIM FROM BEING TOO FRIGHTENED
AWAY BEHIND THE CURRANT ROW WHERE NO ONE ELSE BUT COOK MAY GO FAR IN THE PLOTS
HE DIGS THE FLOWERS GREEN RED AND BLUE NOR WISHES TO BE SPOKEN TO HE DIGS THE FLOWERS AND CUTS THE HAY AND NEVER SEEMS TO WANT TO PLAY
OLD DIAMOND HAD SO MUCH ADO TO STOP THE CAB AGAINST IT
FOR HE HAD NEVER MADE HIMSELF THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE FIRM'S AFFAIRS FEW SPECULATIVE PEOPLE DO KNOW THEIR OWN AFFAIRS HENCE HE NEVER DOUBTED HE SHOULD FIND MATTERS MUCH AS HE LEFT THEM
AND PEEPING ROUND SAW THAT MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CORRECT IT WAS THE KELPIE SHE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER VERY SOFTLY AFRAID OF BEING LOCKED OUT A DANGER WHICH HAD SCARCELY OCCURRED TO ME BEFORE
CAME UP AND MAKING GOOD USE OF HIS STICK DROVE THEM OFF NOW MY LITTLE MAN HE SAID GET ON WHILE YOU CAN
THE OTHER END HAD BEEN TIED TO HER WRIST THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED HE MIGHT PULL HER
LOOKING AFTER YOU OF COURSE THAT'S WHY YOU LOCKED THE DOOR I SUPPOSE TO KEEP ME OUT SHE HAD NO ANSWER READY BUT LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE STRUCK ME
I CAME TO TAKE JAMIE HOME BUT HE WON'T GO YOU'RE A SILLY BOY TO THINK MY BROTHER JOHN WOULD DO HIM ANY HARM SHE RETURNED YOU'RE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH AREN'T YOU JAMIE DUFF
I GAVE THE CORD A GREAT TUG OF ANGER PULLED OUT MY KNIFE AND CUT IT THEN HAULING JAMIE UP GOT HIM HALF AWAKE AT LAST HE STARED WITH FRIGHT FIRST AND THEN BEGAN TO CRY
THAT STORY WAS NOW FAR OFF IN THE PAST
DESIRING NOTHING BUT BED WHEN I CAME NEAR THE HOUSE FROM THE BACK I SAW A FIGURE ENTERING THE GATE FROM THE FRONT IT WAS IN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON WHICH WAS NOW UP A GOOD WAY
BIRDS ALL THE SUNNY DAY FLUTTER AND QUARREL HERE IN THE ARBOUR LIKE TENT OF THE LAUREL HERE IN THE FORK THE BROWN NEST IS SEATED FOUR LITTLE BLUE EGGS
CLEARER GROW AND SPARROW'S WINGS BEAT ON WINDOW LEDGES THESE SHALL WAKE THE YAWNING MAID SHE THE DOOR SHALL OPEN FINDING DEW ON GARDEN GLADE
YES THANK YOU MA'AM QUITE COMFORTABLE SAID JAMIE WHO WAS NOW WIDE AWAKE BUT PLEASE MA'AM RANALD DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM HE'S A HOUSEBREAKER THOUGH
YOU HAD BETTER TELL HIM TOO I SAID THIS NOT THAT I DID NOT BELIEVE SHE HAD BEEN OUT TO LOOK FOR ME BUT BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE HAD LOCKED THE DOOR TO ANNOY ME
ALL THE NAMES I KNOW FROM NURSE GARDENER'S GARTERS SHEPHERD'S PURSE BACHELOR'S BUTTONS LADY'S SMOCK
O'ER THE LAWN UP TO MY KNEE UNDER GRASS ALONE HE LIES LOOKING UP WITH LEADEN EYES SCARLET COAT AND POINTED GUN TO THE STARS AND TO THE SUN
AND SHOWED HIM INTO THE ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR
WITH ONLY THE WIDE SILENT FIELDS ABOUT ME AND THE WIDER AND MORE SILENT SKY OVER MY HEAD THE FEAR BEGAN TO RETURN I FANCIED SOMETHING STRANGE CREEPING ALONG EVERY DITCH
BUT WITH THE MOON AND ITS SHADOWS IT IS VERY DIFFERENT INDEED THE FACT IS THE MOON IS TRYING TO DO WHAT SHE CANNOT DO
AND HE TOLD THEM ALL THEY WANTED TO KNOW BUT WHEN HE PROCEEDED TO HARNESS THE OLD HORSE THEY PUSHED HIM ASIDE WITH ROUGH KINDNESS CALLED HIM A BABY AND BEGAN TO DO IT ALL FOR HIM
BUT COMING RAPIDLY TOWARDS ME ACROSS THE NEAREST FIELD IT ALWAYS VANISHED HOWEVER BEFORE IT CAME CLOSE THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT THE FASTER I RODE THE MORE FRIGHTENED I BECAME
I HAVE SAID THAT HE HAD NOT BEHAVED VERY WELL TO MISS COLEMAN HE HAD PUT OFF THEIR MARRIAGE MORE THAN ONCE IN A COWARDLY FASHION
IT WAS OF COURSE OF NO USE TO DRIVE MISTER EVANS TO CHISWICK BUT IF HE SHOULD TELL HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN THEM AND WHERE THEY LIVED NOW HE MIGHT PUT OFF GOING TO SEE THEM AND HE WAS CERTAIN THAT MISS COLEMAN AT LEAST MUST WANT VERY MUCH TO SEE MISTER EVANS
BUT DIAMOND WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF THINKING ONLY OF HIMSELF HE SAW THAT HIS NEW FRIEND LOOKED WEARY IF NOT ILL AND VERY POOR WON'T YOU JUMP IN SIR HE SAID I WILL TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU LIKE
AT LENGTH I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE KEEPER'S FARM AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE MOON PEEPED FROM BEHIND A HILL THROWING AS LONG SHADOWS AS THE SETTING SUN BUT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
IN A LITTLE WHILE MISTER EVANS CAME OUT AND ASKED HIM TO COME IN DIAMOND OBEYED AND TO HIS DELIGHT MISS COLEMAN PUT HER ARMS ROUND HIM AND KISSED HIM AND THERE WAS PAYMENT FOR HIM NOT TO MENTION THE FIVE PRECIOUS SHILLINGS SHE GAVE HIM
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR FAILURE IT MUST HAVE BEEN NOW ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE CLOUDS HAD CLEARED OFF AND THE NIGHT HAD CHANGED FROM BROWN AND GREY
JUST AS IT WAS SHUT AWAY TOY LIKE IN THE EVEN HERE I SEE IT GLOW WITH DAY UNDER GLOWING HEAVEN EVERY PATH AND EVERY PLOT
NO THANK YOU I SAID I SHALL BE GLAD TO GO TO BED I SHOULD THINK SO SHE ANSWERED JAMIE IS QUITE COMFORTABLE I ASSURE YOU AND I'LL TAKE CARE HE'S IN TIME FOR SCHOOL IN THE MORNING
WHOM THE RELIEF OF BEING CARRIED HAD MADE LESS AND LESS INCLINED TO CARRY HIMSELF HAD BEEN TURNING OVER THINGS IN HIS MIND AND AS THEY PASSED THE MINT CALLED TO DIAMOND
SILLY GARDENER SUMMER GOES AND WINTER COMES WITH PINCHING TOES WHEN IN THE GARDEN BARE AND BROWN YOU MUST LAY YOUR BARROW DOWN
WE HAVE BEAT THE MORNING DRUM PLAYMATE
WHICH IS ALL ABOUT DIAMOND IF HE HAD KNOWN THAT MISS COLEMAN THOUGHT MISTER EVANS WAS DEAD PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE MANAGED DIFFERENTLY THERE WAS A CRY AND A RUNNING TO AND FRO IN THE HOUSE
SHE IS NOT ABLE FOR THIS FOR HER LIGHT IS NOT HER OWN IT IS SECOND HAND FROM THE SUN HIMSELF AND HER SHADOWS THEREFORE ALSO ARE SECOND HAND SHADOWS PIECES CUT OUT OF THE GREAT SUN SHADOW
HE WAS JUST CLAMBERING UP AGAIN WHEN THE GENTLEMAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAID IT'S THE WILDERNESS MISTER COLEMAN'S PLACE BUT I'LL DIRECT YOU WHEN WE COME INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT FLASHED UPON DIAMOND WHO HE WAS
ONE GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED NEAR THE MEWS ENGAGED HIM TO CARRY HIM TO THE CITY EVERY MORNING AT A CERTAIN HOUR AND DIAMOND WAS PUNCTUAL AS CLOCKWORK THOUGH TO EFFECT THAT REQUIRED A GOOD DEAL OF CARE FOR HIS FATHER'S WATCH WAS NOT MUCH TO BE DEPENDED ON
SOON THE FRAIL EGGS THEY SHALL CHIP AND UPSPRINGING MAKE ALL THE APRIL WOODS
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
DO ALL HE COULD HOWEVER HE COULD NOT RECALL WHERE OR WHEN
THANK YOU MY MAN BUT I HAVE NO MONEY SO I CAN'T OH I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY I SHALL BE MUCH HAPPIER IF YOU WILL GET IN YOU HAVE SAVED ME ALL I HAD I OWE YOU A LIFT SIR
WELL NOW AND WHILE THE SUMMER STAYS TO PROFIT BY THESE GARDEN DAYS O HOW MUCH WISER YOU WOULD BE TO PLAY AT INDIAN WARS WITH ME
THEN TURNED TO THE CAB AND SAID BEFORE MISTER EVANS HAD QUITE BEGUN TO THINK SOMETHING MUST BE AMISS PLEASE SIR MY HARNESS HAS GIVEN AWAY WOULD YOU MIND STEPPING IN HERE FOR A FEW MINUTES THEY'RE FRIENDS OF MINE I'LL TAKE YOU WHERE YOU LIKE AFTER I'VE GOT IT MENDED
AND MISTER EVANS HAD GONE OUT WITH IT IN THE HOPE OF TURNING ITS CARGO TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HE WAS ONE OF THE SINGLE BOAT LOAD WHICH MANAGED TO REACH A DESERT ISLAND
LEST HE SHOULD BE BLOWN AWAY BUT HE DID NOT REALLY MIND IT HIS HEAD WAS FULL OF THE DREAM HE HAD DREAMED
WHEN THE GRASS IS RIPE LIKE GRAIN
AS SOON AS HE WAS AWAKE ENOUGH TO KNOW ME HE STOPPED CRYING BUT NOT STARING AND HIS EYES SEEMED TO HAVE NOTHING BETTER THAN MOONLIGHT IN THEM COME ALONG JAMIE I SAID I'M COME TO TAKE YOU HOME
HERE WE HAD BEST ON TIP TOE TREAD WHILE I FOR SAFETY MARCH AHEAD FOR THIS IS THAT ENCHANTED GROUND WHERE ALL WHO LOITER SLUMBER SOUND
FOR THEY HARDLY KNOW LIGHT FROM DARKNESS WELL AT FIRST THE MOON FRIGHTENED ME A LITTLE SHE LOOKED SO KNOWING AND YET ALL SHE SAID ROUND ABOUT ME WAS SO STRANGE
HERE IS SIMPLE SHEPHERD'S LAND HERE ARE THE FAIRY HOLLYHOCKS
IF YOU DIDN'T MIND TAKING ME TO CHISWICK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PAY YOU WHEN WE GOT THERE IT'S A LONG WAY BUT YOU SHALL HAVE THE WHOLE FARE FROM THE DOCKS AND SOMETHING OVER VERY WELL SIR SAID DIAMOND I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY
SOMETHING SHAPELESS BUT WITH A TERRIBLE CRY IN IT NEXT I THOUGHT I SAW A SCARCELY VISIBLE FORM NOW LIKE A CREATURE ON ALL FOURS NOW LIKE A MAN FAR OFF
AND THINKING IT BETTER TO LET HIM HAVE HIS BAG IN THIS QUIET PLACE
THERE WAS NOT MUCH BUSINESS DOING AND DIAMOND FELT RATHER COLD NOTWITHSTANDING HIS MOTHER HAD HERSELF PUT ON HIS COMFORTER AND HELPED HIM WITH HIS GREATCOAT BUT HE WAS TOO WELL AWARE OF HIS DIGNITY TO GET INSIDE HIS CAB AS SOME DO
AND RESPECT MINGLED WITH SADNESS AND THIS OCCURRED EVERY TIME SHE MENTIONED HER ILLUSTRIOUS PATRONESS
FOR IF A CERTAIN MODE OF GOVERNMENT WAS ESTABLISHED OR CERTAIN MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES TOOK PLACE IN CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AND SUCH GEOGRAPHIC ETHNOGRAPHIC OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF MARRYING YOUR PRODIGAL SON ANATOLE SHE ASKED THEY SAY OLD MAIDS HAVE A MANIA FOR MATCHMAKING AND THOUGH I DON'T FEEL THAT WEAKNESS IN MYSELF AS YET
HOW FAR THAT VERB IS FROM THE READER'S BASE OF OPERATIONS WELL IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER THEY PUT THEIR VERB AWAY OVER ON THE NEXT PAGE AND I HAVE HEARD THAT SOMETIMES
LITTLE LEARNING MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN PROVERBS
BY REFUTING THESE NEW LAWS THE FORMER VIEW OF HISTORY MIGHT HAVE BEEN RETAINED BUT WITHOUT REFUTING THEM IT WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE STUDYING HISTORIC EVENTS AS THE RESULTS OF MAN'S FREE WILL
THEY GET IN A HURRY AND HAVE TO GO TO PRESS WITHOUT GETTING TO THE VERB AT ALL OF COURSE THEN THE READER IS LEFT IN A VERY EXHAUSTED AND IGNORANT STATE WE HAVE THE PARENTHESIS DISEASE
WHO DRESSED IN SIMPLE WHITE MUSLIN WITH A SINGLE TUBEROSE IN THE AMPLE FOLDS OF HER RICH BROWN HAIR HAD TOTTERED FEEBLY DOWN THE STAIRS STILL PALE FROM THE TERROR AND EXCITEMENT OF THE PAST EVENING
THE GRAMMATICAL HOROSCOPE OF THIS MATTER I ANSWER UP CONFIDENTLY AND STATE IN GERMAN THAT THE BIRD IS STAYING IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP
IN A KIND OF A GENERAL WAY ON THE GROUND IT IS THEN DEFINITELY LOCATED IT IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS RESTING WHICH IS ONE OF THE GERMAN GRAMMAR'S IDEAS
IN THE FIRST CASE IT WAS NECESSARY TO RENOUNCE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN UNREAL IMMOBILITY IN SPACE AND TO RECOGNIZE A MOTION WE DID NOT FEEL IN THE PRESENT CASE IT IS SIMILARLY NECESSARY
AND REALLY YOU APPRECIATE THEM LESS THAN ANYONE AND SO YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE THEM AND SHE SMILED HER ECSTATIC SMILE I CAN'T HELP IT SAID THE PRINCE
BUT THE SCOTCH CALLED TO THEIR AID ROBERT BRUCE THE GRANDSON OF BALIOL'S COMPETITOR AND HE WAS SOLEMNLY CROWNED AT THE ABBEY OF SCONE DURING A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN AGAINST THESE PEOPLE EDWARD FELL SICK
AS IN THE QUESTION OF ASTRONOMY THEN SO IN THE QUESTION OF HISTORY NOW THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IS BASED ON THE RECOGNITION OR NONRECOGNITION OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTE
NOR COULD NOR CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO CORRECT IN THE MIDST OF A CONVERSATION ON POLITICAL MATTERS ANNA PAVLOVNA BURST OUT OH DON'T SPEAK TO ME OF AUSTRIA PERHAPS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS
THINK OF THE RAGGED POVERTY OF A LANGUAGE WHICH HAS TO MAKE ONE WORD DO THE WORK OF SIX AND A POOR LITTLE WEAK THING OF ONLY THREE LETTERS AT THAT BUT MAINLY
WITH THE FORCEPS AND THEN STAND THERE AND DRAWL THROUGH A TEDIOUS ANECDOTE BEFORE THEY GIVE THE DREADED JERK
LISTEN DEAR ANNETTE SAID THE PRINCE SUDDENLY TAKING ANNA PAVLOVNA'S HAND AND FOR SOME REASON DRAWING IT DOWNWARDS ARRANGE THAT AFFAIR FOR ME AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE YOUR MOST DEVOTED SLAVE
THAT GOD WILL NOT FORSAKE HIM HE WILL FULFILL HIS VOCATION AND CRUSH THE HYDRA OF REVOLUTION WHICH HAS BECOME MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER IN THE PERSON OF THIS MURDERER AND VILLAIN WE ALONE MUST AVENGE THE BLOOD OF THE JUST ONE
BY HER SISTER WAS ALL SHE SAID IN A DRY AND MOURNFUL TONE AS SHE NAMED THE EMPRESS ANNA PAVLOVNA'S FACE SUDDENLY ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF PROFOUND AND SINCERE DEVOTION
OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT AND THE MONUMENT IS FINISHED I SUPPOSE
YOUNG BOLKONSKI'S WIFE THIS VERY EVENING AND PERHAPS THE THING CAN BE ARRANGED
PHILIP MAINTAINED A SECRET UNDERSTANDING WITH BALIOL HOWEVER AND EDWARD CALLED A PARLIAMENT FOUNDED UPON THE GREAT PRINCIPLE THAT WHAT CONCERNS ALL SHOULD BE APPROVED BY ALL
ACCORDING TO WHICH GENDER IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE WHEN I LOOK IN THE INTEREST OF SCIENCE I WILL CIPHER IT OUT ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IT IS MASCULINE VERY WELL THEN THE RAIN
BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO REMEMBER A GOOD DEAL OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE NOW HERE IS A SENTENCE
IT NECESSARILY CAN'T BE CLEARNESS EVEN A JURY WOULD HAVE PENETRATION ENOUGH TO DISCOVER THAT A WRITER'S IDEAS MUST BE A GOOD DEAL CONFUSED A GOOD DEAL OUT OF LINE AND SEQUENCE
DROPS INTO A SENTENCE IT ALWAYS THROWS THAT SUBJECT INTO THE GENITIVE CASE REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES AND THEREFORE THIS BIRD STAYED IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP
THOUGH THEY ARE USUALLY SO MILD AS TO COVER ONLY A FEW LINES AND THEREFORE WHEN YOU AT LAST GET DOWN TO THE VERB IT CARRIES SOME MEANING TO YOUR MIND
LAVATER WOULD HAVE SAID I LACK THE BUMP OF PATERNITY DON'T JOKE I MEAN TO HAVE A SERIOUS TALK WITH YOU DO YOU KNOW I AM DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR YOUNGER SON BETWEEN OURSELVES
BUT AUSTRIA NEVER HAS WISHED AND DOES NOT WISH FOR WAR SHE IS BETRAYING US RUSSIA ALONE MUST SAVE EUROPE OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN RECOGNIZES HIS HIGH VOCATION AND WILL BE TRUE TO IT THAT IS THE ONE THING I HAVE FAITH IN
SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE LAWS OF STATISTICS GEOGRAPHY POLITICAL ECONOMY COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY AND GEOLOGY WHICH DIRECTLY CONTRADICT ITS ASSUMPTIONS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE OLD VIEWS AND THE NEW
OR HAUGWITZ EITHER THIS FAMOUS PRUSSIAN NEUTRALITY IS JUST A TRAP I HAVE FAITH ONLY IN GOD AND THE LOFTY DESTINY OF OUR ADORED MONARCH HE WILL SAVE EUROPE
BUT ANATOLE IS AN ACTIVE ONE THAT IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM HE SAID THIS SMILING IN A WAY MORE NATURAL AND ANIMATED THAN USUAL SO THAT THE WRINKLES ROUND HIS MOUTH
I DON'T SPEAK OF ANATOLE YOUR YOUNGEST I DON'T LIKE HIM SHE ADDED IN A TONE ADMITTING OF NO REJOINDER AND RAISING HER EYEBROWS TWO SUCH CHARMING CHILDREN
TO BE APPOINTED FIRST SECRETARY AT VIENNA THE BARON BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS A POOR CREATURE PRINCE VASILI WISHED TO OBTAIN THIS POST FOR HIS SON
WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF SLIDING IT INTO THE ACCUSATIVE CASE
SIE MEANS YOU AND IT MEANS SHE AND IT MEANS HER AND IT MEANS IT AND IT MEANS THEY AND IT MEANS THEM
AND TO YOU ALONE I CAN CONFESS THAT MY CHILDREN ARE THE BANE OF MY LIFE
SO FAR AS THE STEAMER IS CONCERNED BUT THE STATEMENT CAN DO NO HARM
TO SECURE IT FOR THE BARON ANNA PAVLOVNA ALMOST CLOSED HER EYES TO INDICATE THAT NEITHER SHE NOR ANYONE ELSE HAD A RIGHT TO CRITICIZE WHAT THE EMPRESS DESIRED OR WAS PLEASED WITH
DESPITE HER FORTY YEARS OVERFLOWED WITH ANIMATION AND IMPULSIVENESS TO BE AN ENTHUSIAST HAD BECOME HER SOCIAL VOCATION AND SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN SHE DID NOT FEEL LIKE IT SHE BECAME ENTHUSIASTIC
WAS LONG AND STUBBORNLY FOUGHT OUT IN PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY THEOLOGY STOOD ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEWS AND ACCUSED THE NEW OF VIOLATING REVELATION BUT WHEN TRUTH CONQUERED THEOLOGY ESTABLISHED ITSELF JUST AS FIRMLY ON THE NEW FOUNDATION
BY DISPROVING THAT LAW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO RETAIN THE OLD CONCEPTION OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BODIES BUT WITHOUT DISPROVING IT IT WOULD SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE STUDYING THE PTOLEMAIC WORLDS
WITH THE GERMANS IT IS DOUBTLESS THE MARK AND SIGN OF A PRACTICED PEN AND OF THE PRESENCE OF THAT SORT OF LUMINOUS INTELLECTUAL FOG WHICH STANDS FOR CLEARNESS AMONG THESE PEOPLE FOR SURELY IT IS NOT
THE SUBDUED SMILE WHICH THOUGH IT DID NOT SUIT HER FADED FEATURES ALWAYS PLAYED ROUND HER LIPS EXPRESSED AS IN A SPOILED CHILD A CONTINUAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER CHARMING DEFECT WHICH SHE NEITHER WISHED
THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT BUONAPARTE HAS BURNT HIS BOATS AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE READY TO BURN OURS PRINCE VASILI ALWAYS SPOKE LANGUIDLY LIKE AN ACTOR REPEATING A STALE PART
SAYS SIE TO ME I GENERALLY TRY TO KILL HIM
HE MUST DO SOMETHING TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY OR HE WILL BECOME DISLIKED AUTHOR
AND DELIVERED BY A SCARLET LIVERIED FOOTMAN THAT MORNING RAN AS FOLLOWS IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO COUNT OR PRINCE AND IF THE PROSPECT OF SPENDING AN EVENING WITH A POOR INVALID IS NOT TOO TERRIBLE
AND YOU ARE NO LONGER MY FRIEND NO LONGER MY FAITHFUL SLAVE AS YOU CALL YOURSELF BUT HOW DO YOU DO
AND IN THIRTEEN TWELVE THE ROYAL FAVORITE WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND NEAR HIM A LARGE POOL OF BLOOD AND ON A FURTHER SEARCH DISCOVERED HIS OWN HEAD LYING IN THE GUTTER OF THE COURT TURNING SICK AT THE GORY SIGHT
SERVING AS THE MEASURE OF VISIBLE PHENOMENA IN ASTRONOMY
ON THE OTHER IS THE PASSION FOR DESTRUCTION TO THE MEN WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE RISING TRUTHS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY IT SEEMED THAT IF THEY ADMITTED THAT TRUTH IT WOULD DESTROY FAITH IN GOD IN THE CREATION OF THE FIRMAMENT
SHE HAS A BROTHER I THINK YOU KNOW HIM
THEN THE FREE WILL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO APPEAR TO US TO HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT MODE OF GOVERNMENT OR OCCASIONED THE MIGRATIONS CAN NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS THE CAUSE AND YET THE FORMER HISTORY CONTINUES TO BE STUDIED
WHERE HE DIED IN BOUNDLESS OBSCURITY IN TWELVE NINETY SEVEN BALIOL WAS SUCCEEDED BY THE BRAVE WILLIAM WALLACE WHO WON A GREAT BATTLE AT STIRLING BUT WAS AFTERWARDS DEFEATED ENTIRELY AT FALKIRK
SLAFE WITH AN F AS A VILLAGE ELDER OF MINE WRITES IN HIS REPORTS SHE IS RICH AND OF GOOD FAMILY AND THAT'S ALL I WANT AND WITH THE FAMILIARITY AND EASY GRACE PECULIAR TO HIM
IN OUR LITERATURE TOO AND ONE MAY SEE CASES OF IT EVERY DAY IN OUR BOOKS AND NEWSPAPERS BUT WITH US IT IS THE MARK AND SIGN OF AN UNPRACTICED WRITER OR A CLOUDY INTELLECT WHEREAS
IT IS ALWAYS INQUIRING AFTER THINGS WHICH ARE OF NO SORT OF CONSEQUENCE TO ANYBODY WHERE IS THE BIRD NOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION ACCORDING TO THE BOOK IS
BUT EVEN AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE LAW OF COPERNICUS
THAT IF YOU HAD BEEN SENT INSTEAD OF OUR DEAR WINTZINGERODE YOU WOULD HAVE CAPTURED THE KING OF PRUSSIA'S CONSENT BY ASSAULT YOU ARE SO ELOQUENT WILL YOU GIVE ME A CUP OF TEA IN A MOMENT
THERE ARE NO PARENTHESIS MARKS OR HYPHENS AND THE READER IS LEFT TO FLOUNDER THROUGH TO THE REMOTE VERB THE BEST WAY HE CAN BUT WHEN HE UPON THE STREET THE
FROM THE TIME THE FIRST PERSON SAID AND PROVED THAT THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS OR OF CRIMES
BENEATH THE POLITENESS AND AFFECTED SYMPATHY OF WHICH INDIFFERENCE AND EVEN IRONY COULD BE DISCERNED CAN ONE BE WELL WHILE SUFFERING MORALLY CAN ONE BE CALM IN TIMES LIKE THESE IF ONE HAS ANY FEELING
PHILIP THEN SUBPOENAED EDWARD AS DUKE OF GUIENNE TO SHOW CAUSE WHY HE SHOULD NOT PAY DAMAGES FOR THE LOSS OF THE NAVY WHICH COULD NOT BE REPLACED FOR LESS THAN TWENTY POUNDS AND FINALLY WHEEDLED EDWARD OUT OF THE DUCHY
BRUCE SURPRISED THE CAVALRY WITH DEEP PITS AND BEFORE THE ENGLISH COULD RECOVER FROM THIS
THAT TO LEARN TO READ AND UNDERSTAND A GERMAN NEWSPAPER IS A THING WHICH MUST ALWAYS REMAIN AN IMPOSSIBILITY TO A FOREIGNER YET EVEN THE GERMAN BOOKS ARE NOT ENTIRELY FREE
AND WHAT HAVE THEY PROMISED NOTHING AND WHAT LITTLE THEY HAVE PROMISED THEY WILL NOT PERFORM PRUSSIA HAS ALWAYS DECLARED THAT BUONAPARTE IS INVINCIBLE AND THAT ALL EUROPE IS POWERLESS BEFORE HIM
AND OF THE MOTION OF THE PLANETS SO IN HISTORY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE SUBJECTION OF PERSONALITY TO THE LAWS OF SPACE TIME AND CAUSE
ALL THESE FESTIVITIES AND FIREWORKS ARE BECOMING WEARISOME IF THEY HAD KNOWN THAT YOU WISHED IT THE ENTERTAINMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT OFF SAID THE PRINCE WHO LIKE A WOUND UP CLOCK
AND HER FACE ASSUMED ITS MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION HE WAS MENTIONED AT HER MAJESTY'S AND YOU WERE PITIED THE PRINCE ANSWERED NOTHING BUT SHE LOOKED AT HIM SIGNIFICANTLY AWAITING A REPLY
THE KING CAME AROUND TO BERWICK FROM DUNBAR BY STEAMER
THEY ORGANIZED A SCHEME TO THROW OFF THE SPENCERS AND DETHRONE EDWARD THE THINKLESS
IN SATIN AND SILK COVERED NOW VERY UNCONSTRAINED AFTER THE NEWEST FASHIONED DRESSED
OR PETRIFY IT PERSONAL PRONOUNS AND ADJECTIVES ARE A FRUITFUL NUISANCE IN THIS LANGUAGE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT FOR INSTANCE THE SAME SOUND
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF AN ATTRACTIVE TRIFLER NAMED GAVESTON DAWDLED AWAY HIS DAYS AND FRITTERED AWAY HIS NIGHTS FINALLY THE NOBLES WHO DISLIKED GAVESTON CAPTURED HIM AND PUT HIM IN WARWICK CASTLE
AND ROBERT BRUCE WAS BESIEGING THE LATTER THE ENGLISH NUMBERING ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AT BANNOCKBURN FOUGHT AGAINST THIRTY THOUSAND SCOTS
AND ONE DAY I SURPRISED THE KEEPER OF IT WITH MY GERMAN I SPOKE ENTIRELY IN THAT LANGUAGE HE WAS GREATLY INTERESTED
THINK OF THE EXASPERATION OF NEVER KNOWING WHICH OF THESE MEANINGS THE SPEAKER IS TRYING TO CONVEY THIS EXPLAINS WHY
SIT DOWN AND TELL ME ALL THE NEWS IT WAS IN JULY EIGHTEEN O FIVE AND THE SPEAKER WAS THE WELL KNOWN ANNA PAVLOVNA SCHERER MAID OF HONOR AND FAVORITE OF THE EMPRESS MARYA FEDOROVNA WITH THESE WORDS SHE GREETED PRINCE VASILI KURAGIN
MAKING PENS WITHIN PENS FINALLY ALL THE PARENTHESES
BUT THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS NOT EXTENDED TO ANYTHING BUT RAIN THERE ARE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH AND THEY ARE ALL TROUBLESOME AN AVERAGE SENTENCE IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER
WHENEVER TIMES WERE HARD THE JEWS WERE IMPRISONED AND ON ONE JOB LOT ALONE TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS WERE REALIZED IN RANSOM AND STILL THE JEWS ARE NOT YET CONSIDERED AS AMONG THE REDEEMED IN TWELVE NINETY
THE AWFUL GERMAN LANGUAGE
ARE MASSED TOGETHER BETWEEN A COUPLE OF KING PARENTHESES ONE OF WHICH IS PLACED IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE MAJESTIC SENTENCE AND THE OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST LINE OF IT
UNINVITED DEFENDERS OF THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY TODAY USE THAT LAW AS A WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION THOUGH THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY IN HISTORY LIKE THE LAW OF COPERNICUS IN ASTRONOMY FAR FROM DESTROYING
IN THE ONE CASE AS IN THE OTHER ON BOTH SIDES THE STRUGGLE PROVOKES PASSION AND STIFLES TRUTH ON THE ONE HAND THERE IS FEAR AND REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF THE WHOLE EDIFICE CONSTRUCTED THROUGH THE AGES
AND ANOTHER PERSON WHOSE NAME IS NOT GIVEN
A PROPOS SHE ADDED BECOMING CALM AGAIN I AM EXPECTING TWO VERY INTERESTING MEN TONIGHT LE VICOMTE DE MORTEMART
JUST AS PROLONGED AND STUBBORN IS THE STRUGGLE NOW PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW CONCEPTION OF HISTORY AND THEOLOGY IN THE SAME WAY STANDS ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEW AND ACCUSES THE NEW VIEW OF SUBVERTING REVELATION
UNTIL HE JOTS DOWN AN INVENTORY OF THE WOMAN'S DRESS THAT IS MANIFESTLY ABSURD IT REMINDS A PERSON OF THOSE DENTISTS WHO SECURE YOUR INSTANT AND BREATHLESS INTEREST IN A TOOTH
INTRUDES ITSELF INTO MY SENTENCE CLOTHED WITH AN AWFUL AND UNSUSPECTED POWER AND CRUMBLES THE GROUND FROM UNDER ME FOR INSTANCE MY BOOK INQUIRES AFTER A CERTAIN BIRD
AND AT THE SAME TIME TO CONSOLE HIM SO SHE SAID NOW ABOUT YOUR FAMILY DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE YOUR DAUGHTER CAME OUT EVERYONE HAS BEEN ENRAPTURED BY HER
AND REMAIN IN JAIL THERE INSTEAD OF CAUSING A SCANDAL BY STAYING AWAY AND SPENDING HIS MONEY IN WALES HE WAS CONFINED IN KENILWORTH CASTLE WHILE HIS SON WAS OSTENSIBLY KING THOUGH HIS WIFE AND MORTIMER REALLY MANAGED THE KINGDOM
OF THE TEN PARTS OF SPEECH HE TURNS OVER THE PAGE AND READS LET THE PUPIL MAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS HE RUNS HIS EYE DOWN
ENGLAND WITH HER COMMERCIAL SPIRIT WILL NOT AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER'S LOFTINESS OF SOUL SHE HAS REFUSED TO EVACUATE MALTA SHE WANTED TO FIND AND STILL SEEKS SOME SECRET MOTIVE IN OUR ACTIONS
SHE WAS AS SHE SAID SUFFERING FROM
AND WITH THE GENTLE PATRONIZING INTONATION NATURAL TO A MAN OF IMPORTANCE WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOCIETY AND AT COURT HE WENT UP TO ANNA PAVLOVNA KISSED HER HAND PRESENTING TO HER HIS BALD SCENTED AND SHINING HEAD
AND PERCEPTION BEFITTING A MAN OF THE WORLD HE INDICATED BY A MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING THIS INFORMATION DO YOU KNOW HE SAID AT LAST
WITH BANNERS AND BAGPIPES AND THOUGH THEY WERE REALLY TEAMSTERS IN DISGUISE THEIR HOSTILE APPEARANCE AND THE DEPRESSING MUSIC OF THE BAGPIPES SO SHOCKED THE ENGLISH THAT THEY DID NOT STOP RUNNING UNTIL THEY REACHED BERWICK
THAT IT IS NO MOONLIGHT FROLIC EDWARD FLED TO WALES
THE PRINCE BOWED TO SIGNIFY HIS RESPECT AND GRATITUDE I OFTEN THINK SHE CONTINUED AFTER A SHORT PAUSE DRAWING NEARER TO THE PRINCE AND SMILING AMIABLY AT HIM AS IF TO SHOW THAT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL TOPICS
AFTER HAVING BEEN MOST INHUMANLY TREATED IN BERKELEY CASTLE WHITHER HE HAD BEEN REMOVED THUS ENDS THE SAD HISTORY OF A MONARCH WHO MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A MINOR POSITION ON A HEN FARM BUT WHO MADE A BEASTLY FLUKE IN THE KING BUSINESS
SHE SUDDENLY PAUSED SMILING AT HER OWN IMPETUOSITY
WHAT ANSWER DID NOVOSILTSEV GET NONE THE ENGLISH HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE SELF ABNEGATION OF OUR EMPEROR WHO WANTS NOTHING FOR HIMSELF BUT ONLY DESIRES THE GOOD OF MANKIND
HAS TO PERFORM THE NOBLEST ROLE ON EARTH
HE RAISED THE MAID OF HONOR'S HAND TO HIS LIPS KISSED IT AND SWUNG IT TO AND FRO AS HE LAY BACK IN HIS ARMCHAIR LOOKING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION ATTENDEZ SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA REFLECTING
EDWARD FOUND HIMSELF NOW ON THE VERGE OF OPEN WAR WITH IRELAND AND WALES
WITH A SLIGHT PARENTHESIS IN IT I WILL MAKE A PERFECTLY LITERAL TRANSLATION AND THROW IN THE PARENTHESIS MARKS AND SOME HYPHENS FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF THE READER THOUGH IN THE ORIGINAL
AND HE UTILIZED THE LAW OF GRAVITATION AS A WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION JUST SO IT NOW SEEMS AS IF WE HAVE ONLY TO ADMIT THE LAW OF INEVITABILITY TO DESTROY THE CONCEPTION OF THE SOUL
HE FROWNED WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO HE SAID AT LAST YOU KNOW I DID ALL A FATHER COULD FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE BOTH TURNED OUT FOOLS HIPPOLYTE IS AT LEAST A QUIET FOOL
THAT IS HOW I EXPLAIN IT TO MYSELF IT CAN'T BE HELPED HE SAID NO MORE BUT EXPRESSED HIS RESIGNATION TO CRUEL FATE BY A GESTURE ANNA PAVLOVNA MEDITATED
NOT NECESSARY BUT PRETTY GERMAN BOOKS ARE EASY ENOUGH TO READ WHEN YOU HOLD THEM BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS OR STAND ON YOUR HEAD SO AS TO REVERSE THE CONSTRUCTION BUT I THINK
MAINLY OF COMPOUND WORDS CONSTRUCTED BY THE WRITER ON THE SPOT AND NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY DICTIONARY SIX OR SEVEN WORDS COMPACTED INTO ONE WITHOUT JOINT OR SEAM THAT IS
BUT AS IN ASTRONOMY THE NEW VIEW SAID IT IS TRUE THAT WE DO NOT FEEL THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH
CONCEIVE OF ANYTHING MORE CONFUSING THAN THAT THESE THINGS ARE CALLED SEPARABLE VERBS THE GERMAN GRAMMAR IS BLISTERED ALL OVER WITH SEPARABLE VERBS AND THE WIDER
THAT THE BIRD IS WAITING IN THE BLACKSMITH SHOP ON ACCOUNT OF THE RAIN OF COURSE NO BIRD WOULD DO THAT BUT THEN YOU MUST STICK TO THE BOOK VERY WELL
WITHOUT HYPHENS IT TREATS OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS EACH ENCLOSED IN A PARENTHESIS OF ITS OWN WITH HERE AND THERE EXTRA PARENTHESES
IS DETERMINED BY CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THAT CERTAIN RELATIONS OF POPULATION TO SOIL PRODUCE MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES THE FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH HISTORY HAD BEEN BUILT WERE DESTROYED IN THEIR ESSENCE
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO MEET THEM SAID THE PRINCE BUT TELL ME HE ADDED WITH STUDIED CARELESSNESS AS IF IT HAD ONLY JUST OCCURRED TO HIM THOUGH THE QUESTION HE WAS ABOUT TO ASK WAS THE CHIEF MOTIVE OF HIS VISIT
DON'T TEASE WELL AND WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED ABOUT NOVOSILTSEV'S DISPATCH YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT IT REPLIED THE PRINCE IN A COLD LISTLESS TONE WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED
WHEN HE STARTS OUT TO SAY THAT A MAN MET A COUNSELOR'S WIFE IN THE STREET AND THEN RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THIS SO SIMPLE UNDERTAKING HALTS THESE APPROACHING PEOPLE AND MAKES THEM STAND STILL
IT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTY AND ANNOYANCE FOR THREE OF OUR TEACHERS HAD DIED IN THE MEAN TIME A PERSON WHO HAS NOT STUDIED GERMAN CAN FORM NO IDEA
I WILL DIRECTLY SIR REPLIED OLIVER UNDOING THE CHAIN AND TURNING THE KEY I SUPPOSE YER THE NEW BOY AIN'T YER SAID THE VOICE THROUGH THE KEY HOLE YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER HOW OLD ARE YER INQUIRED THE VOICE
SAW HIM SAFELY OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD LOCKED THE GATE AND DEPARTED ON THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS WELL OLIVER SAID SOWERBERRY AS THEY WALKED HOME HOW DO YOU LIKE IT PRETTY WELL THANK YOU SIR
REPLIED OLIVER WITH CONSIDERABLE HESITATION NOT VERY MUCH SIR
A GREAT MANY OF THE TENEMENTS HAD SHOP FRONTS BUT THESE WERE FAST CLOSED AND MOULDERING AWAY
UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES SHE MERELY INQUIRED WITH MUCH SHARPNESS WHY SUCH AN OBVIOUS SUGGESTION HAD NOT PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER HUSBAND'S MIND BEFORE MISTER SOWERBERRY RIGHTLY CONSTRUED THIS AS AN ACQUIESCENCE IN HIS PROPOSITION
AND THE TWO MOURNERS WAITED PATIENTLY IN THE DAMP CLAY WITH A COLD RAIN DRIZZLING DOWN WHILE THE RAGGED BOYS WHOM THE SPECTACLE HAD ATTRACTED INTO THE CHURCHYARD PLAYED A NOISY GAME AT HIDE AND SEEK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES
DIFFICULT TASK FOR THE GRAVE WAS SO FULL THAT THE UPPERMOST COFFIN WAS WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SURFACE
IS AN UNDISTINGUISHED DESTRUCTION OF ALL AGES SEXES AND CONDITIONS IN EVERY STAGE OF THESE OPPRESSIONS WE HAVE PETITIONED FOR REDRESS IN THE MOST HUMBLE TERMS
UNLESS THOSE PEOPLE WOULD RELINQUISH THE RIGHT OF REPRESENTATION IN THE LEGISLATURE A RIGHT INESTIMABLE TO THEM AND FORMIDABLE TO TYRANTS ONLY HE HAS CALLED TOGETHER LEGISLATIVE BODIES AT PLACES UNUSUAL
THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE WAS WRINKLED HER TWO REMAINING TEETH PROTRUDED OVER HER UNDER LIP AND HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND PIERCING OLIVER WAS AFRAID TO LOOK AT EITHER HER OR THE MAN
IT WAS SPEEDILY DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT OLIVER SHOULD BE AT ONCE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE TRADE AND WITH THIS VIEW THAT HE SHOULD ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER ON THE VERY NEXT OCCASION OF HIS SERVICES BEING REQUIRED
THEY WALKED ON FOR SOME TIME THROUGH THE MOST CROWDED AND DENSELY INHABITED PART OF THE TOWN AND THEN STRIKING DOWN A NARROW STREET MORE DIRTY AND MISERABLE THAN ANY THEY HAD YET PASSED THROUGH PAUSED TO LOOK FOR THE HOUSE WHICH WAS THE OBJECT OF THEIR SEARCH
AND WITHOUT ALLOWING TIME FOR ANY OBSERVATION ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART PROCEEDED I DON'T MEAN A REGULAR MUTE TO ATTEND GROWN UP PEOPLE MY DEAR BUT ONLY FOR CHILDREN'S PRACTICE IT WOULD BE VERY NEW TO HAVE A MUTE IN PROPORTION MY DEAR
FOR OPPOSING WITH MANLY FIRMNESS HIS INVASIONS ON THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE HE HAS REFUSED FOR A LONG TIME AFTER SUCH DISSOLUTIONS TO CAUSE OTHERS TO BE ELECTED
OR VARIED THEIR AMUSEMENTS BY JUMPING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS OVER THE COFFIN MISTER SOWERBERRY AND BUMBLE BEING PERSONAL FRIENDS OF THE CLERK SAT BY THE FIRE WITH HIM AND READ THE PAPER
THE SOONER THIS JOB IS DONE THE BETTER NOAH LOOK AFTER THE SHOP OLIVER PUT ON YOUR CAP AND COME WITH ME OLIVER OBEYED AND FOLLOWED HIS MASTER ON HIS PROFESSIONAL MISSION
AND THE BARE COFFIN HAVING BEEN SCREWED DOWN WAS HOISTED ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE BEARERS AND CARRIED INTO THE STREET NOW YOU MUST PUT YOUR BEST LEG FOREMOST OLD LADY
THE CRAZY OLD WOMAN WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN BEWAILING THE LOSS OF HER CLOAK WHICH THE UNDERTAKER HAD TAKEN OFF TO PAY HIM ANY ATTENTION SO THEY THREW A CAN OF COLD WATER OVER HIM AND WHEN HE CAME TO
AT THIS THE CHARITY BOY LOOKED MONSTROUS FIERCE AND SAID THAT OLIVER WOULD WANT ONE BEFORE LONG IF HE CUT JOKES WITH HIS SUPERIORS IN THAT WAY YER DON'T KNOW WHO I AM I SUPPOSE WORK'US SAID THE CHARITY BOY IN CONTINUATION
MISSUS SOWERBERRY WHO HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TASTE IN THE UNDERTAKING WAY WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE NOVELTY OF THIS IDEA
AND OF CONSANGUINITY WE MUST THEREFORE ACQUIESCE IN THE NECESSITY WHICH DENOUNCES OUR SEPARATION AND HOLD THEM AS WE HOLD THE REST OF MANKIND ENEMIES IN WAR IN PEACE FRIENDS
AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT THEM THEN ONLY A WOMAN WHO LODGES IN THE SAME HOUSE MADE AN APPLICATION TO THE POROCHIAL COMMITTEE FOR THEM TO SEND THE POROCHIAL SURGEON TO SEE A WOMAN AS WAS VERY BAD HE HAD GONE OUT TO DINNER
UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE SHOULD BE FIRMLY BOUND FOR SEVEN YEARS AND ALL DANGER OF HIS BEING RETURNED UPON THE HANDS OF THE PARISH SHOULD BE THUS EFFECTUALLY AND LEGALLY OVERCOME WELL SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY TAKING UP HIS HAT
HE STOPPED SHORT WELL SAID MISSUS SOWERBERRY SHARPLY NOTHING MY DEAR NOTHING SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY UGH YOU BRUTE SAID MISSUS SOWERBERRY
SEND ME A LARGE CLOAK A GOOD WARM ONE FOR IT IS BITTER COLD WE SHOULD HAVE CAKE AND WINE TOO BEFORE WE GO NEVER MIND SEND SOME BREAD
AND THE TWO MOURNERS KEPT AS NEAR THEM AS THEY COULD MISTER BUMBLE AND SOWERBERRY WALKED AT A GOOD SMART PACE IN FRONT AND OLIVER WHOSE LEGS WERE NOT SO LONG AS HIS MASTER'S RAN BY THE SIDE
OLIVER HAVING TAKEN DOWN THE SHUTTERS AND BROKEN A PANE OF GLASS IN HIS EFFORT TO STAGGER AWAY BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF THE FIRST ONE TO A SMALL COURT AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE KEPT DURING THE DAY WAS GRACIOUSLY ASSISTED BY NOAH
THE REGRET OF NO RECENT SEPARATION WAS FRESH IN HIS MIND THE ABSENCE OF NO LOVED AND WELL REMEMBERED FACE SANK HEAVILY INTO HIS HEART BUT HIS HEART WAS HEAVY NOTWITHSTANDING
AS HE SAT SHIVERING ON THE BOX IN THE COLDEST CORNER OF THE ROOM AND ATE THE STALE PIECES WHICH HAD BEEN SPECIALLY RESERVED FOR HIM
BY DECLARING US OUT OF HIS PROTECTION AND WAGING WAR AGAINST US HE HAS PLUNDERED OUR SEAS RAVAGED OUR COASTS BURNT OUR TOWNS AND DESTROYED THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE HE IS AT THIS TIME
COME THAT'S TOO MUCH OH IT'S SICKENING REPLIED THE BEADLE ANTIMONIAL MISTER SOWERBERRY SO IT IS ACQUIESCED THE UNDERTAKER WE ONLY HEARD OF THE FAMILY THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST SAID THE BEADLE
IT IS THEIR RIGHT IT IS THEIR DUTY TO THROW OFF SUCH GOVERNMENT AND TO PROVIDE NEW GUARDS FOR THEIR FUTURE SECURITY SUCH HAS BEEN THE PATIENT SUFFERANCE OF THESE COLONIES AND SUCH IS NOW THE NECESSITY
AND IN A SMALL RECESS OPPOSITE THE DOOR THERE LAY UPON THE GROUND SOMETHING COVERED WITH AN OLD BLANKET OLIVER SHUDDERED AS HE CAST HIS EYES TOWARD THE PLACE AND CREPT INVOLUNTARILY CLOSER TO HIS MASTER
ALL HIS RELATIONS LET HIM HAVE HIS OWN WAY PRETTY WELL EH CHARLOTTE HE HE HE OH YOU QUEER SOUL SAID CHARLOTTE BURSTING INTO A HEARTY LAUGH IN WHICH SHE WAS JOINED BY NOAH AFTER WHICH THEY BOTH LOOKED SCORNFULLY AT POOR OLIVER TWIST
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS THE NIGHTLY HAUNTS OF SOME HOUSELESS WRETCHES FOR MANY OF THE ROUGH BOARDS WHICH SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF DOOR AND WINDOW WERE WRENCHED FROM THEIR POSITIONS TO AFFORD AN APERTURE WIDE ENOUGH
THAN TO RIGHT THEMSELVES BY ABOLISHING THE FORMS TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED BUT WHEN A LONG TRAIN OF ABUSES AND USURPATIONS PURSUING INVARIABLY THE SAME OBJECT EVINCES A DESIGN TO REDUCE THEM UNDER ABSOLUTE DESPOTISM
WE ARE RATHER LATE AND IT WON'T DO TO KEEP THE CLERGYMAN WAITING MOVE ON MY MEN AS QUICK AS YOU LIKE
WITH THIS MISTER CLAYPOLE ADMINISTERED A KICK TO OLIVER AND ENTERED THE SHOP WITH A DIGNIFIED AIR WHICH DID HIM GREAT CREDIT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A LARGE HEADED SMALL EYED YOUTH OF LUMBERING MAKE AND HEAVY COUNTENANCE
AND THE AMOUNT AND PAYMENT OF THEIR SALARIES HE HAS ERECTED A MULTITUDE OF NEW OFFICES AND SENT HITHER SWARMS OF OFFICERS TO HARASS OUR PEOPLE AND EAT OUT THEIR SUBSTANCE
DERIVING THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED THAT WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE OF THESE ENDS IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR TO ABOLISH IT AND TO INSTITUTE NEW GOVERNMENT
AND THAT ALL POLITICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM AND THE STATE OF GREAT BRITAIN IS AND OUGHT TO BE TOTALLY DISSOLVED
FOR CUTTING OFF OUR TRADE WITH ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD FOR IMPOSING TAXES ON US WITHOUT OUR CONSENT FOR DEPRIVING US IN MANY CASES OF THE BENEFITS OF TRIAL BY JURY
D'YE HEAR WORK'US SAID NOAH CLAYPOLE
COFFIN PLATES ELM CHIPS BRIGHT HEADED NAILS AND SHREDS OF BLACK CLOTH LAY SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR AND THE WALL BEHIND THE COUNTER WAS ORNAMENTED WITH A LIVELY REPRESENTATION OF TWO MUTES
TILL HIS ASSENT SHOULD BE OBTAINED AND WHEN SO SUSPENDED HE HAS UTTERLY NEGLECTED TO ATTEND TO THEM HE HAS REFUSED TO PASS OTHER LAWS FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF LARGE DISTRICTS OF PEOPLE
THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS THAT TO SECURE THESE RIGHTS GOVERNMENTS ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN
LAYING ITS FOUNDATION ON SUCH PRINCIPLES AND ORGANIZING ITS POWERS IN SUCH FORM AS TO THEM SHALL SEEM MOST LIKELY TO EFFECT THEIR SAFETY AND HAPPINESS PRUDENCE INDEED WILL DICTATE
OLIVER HAD BEEN TOO OFTEN SUBJECTED TO THE PROCESS TO WHICH THE VERY EXPRESSIVE MONOSYLLABLE JUST RECORDED BEARS REFERENCE TO ENTERTAIN THE SMALLEST DOUBT THAT THE OWNER OF THE VOICE WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE
NOTHING WHEN YOU ARE USED TO IT MY BOY OLIVER WONDERED IN HIS OWN MIND WHETHER IT HAD TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME TO GET MISTER SOWERBERRY USED TO IT
IN AN ANGRY AND IMPETUOUS MANNER ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TIMES WHEN HE BEGAN TO UNDO THE CHAIN THE LEGS DESISTED AND A VOICE BEGAN OPEN THE DOOR WILL YER
SO GROPING HIS WAY CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE DARK PASSAGE AND BIDDING OLIVER KEEP CLOSE TO HIM AND NOT BE AFRAID THE UNDERTAKER MOUNTED TO THE TOP OF THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS STUMBLING AGAINST A DOOR ON THE LANDING HE RAPPED AT IT WITH HIS KNUCKLES
HAVE RETURNED TO THE PEOPLE AT LARGE FOR THEIR EXERCISE THE STATE REMAINING IN THE MEAN TIME EXPOSED TO ALL THE DANGERS OF INVASION FROM WITHOUT AND CONVULSIONS WITHIN
NO CHANCE CHILD WAS HE FOR HE COULD TRACE HIS GENEALOGY ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIS PARENTS WHO LIVED HARD BY HIS MOTHER BEING A WASHERWOMAN AND HIS FATHER A DRUNKEN SOLDIER DISCHARGED WITH A WOODEN LEG AND A DIURNAL PENSION OF TWOPENCE HALFPENNY AND AN UNSTATEABLE FRACTION
AND THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN HAVING READ AS MUCH OF THE BURIAL SERVICE AS COULD BE COMPRESSED INTO FOUR MINUTES GAVE HIS SURPLICE TO THE CLERK AND WALKED AWAY AGAIN NOW BILL SAID SOWERBERRY TO THE GRAVE DIGGER FILL UP IT WAS NO VERY
AT LENGTH AFTER A LAPSE OF SOMETHING MORE THAN AN HOUR MISTER BUMBLE AND SOWERBERRY AND THE CLERK WERE SEEN RUNNING TOWARDS THE GRAVE
CLENCHING HIS HANDS AND STAMPING FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR
UNCOMFORTABLE AND DISTANT FROM THE DEPOSITORY OF THEIR PUBLIC RECORDS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FATIGUING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE WITH HIS MEASURES HE HAS DISSOLVED REPRESENTATIVE HOUSES REPEATEDLY
AND HE WISHED AS HE CREPT INTO HIS NARROW BED THAT THAT WERE HIS COFFIN AND THAT HE COULD BE LAIN IN A CALM AND LASTING SLEEP IN THE CHURCHYARD GROUND WITH THE TALL GRASS WAVING GENTLY ABOVE HIS HEAD
WHICH HE CUT INTO WEDGES THE SIZE OF HIS MOUTH WITH A CLASP KNIFE AND THEN CONSUMED WITH GREAT DEXTERITY I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID OLIVER AT LENGTH
IN GENERAL CONGRESS ASSEMBLED APPEALING TO THE SUPREME JUDGE OF THE WORLD FOR THE RECTITUDE OF OUR INTENTIONS DO IN THE NAME AND BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THESE COLONIES SOLEMNLY PUBLISH AND DECLARE
IT WAS OPENED BY A YOUNG GIRL OF THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN THE UNDERTAKER AT ONCE SAW ENOUGH OF WHAT THE ROOM CONTAINED TO KNOW IT WAS THE APARTMENT TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED HE STEPPED IN OLIVER FOLLOWED HIM
SHE COULDN'T EVEN SEE HER CHILDREN'S FACES THOUGH WE HEARD HER GASPING OUT THEIR NAMES
WOULD REDEEM HIS PLEDGE MOST HONOURABLY HE DREW BACK THE BOLTS WITH A TREMBLING HAND AND OPENED THE DOOR FOR A SECOND OR TWO OLIVER GLANCED UP THE STREET AND DOWN THE STREET AND OVER THE WAY
AS THEIR NEGLECTED APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENTLY DENOTED WITHOUT THE CONCURRENT TESTIMONY AFFORDED BY THE SQUALID LOOKS OF THE FEW MEN AND WOMEN WHO WITH FOLDED ARMS AND BODIES HALF DOUBLED OCCASIONALLY SKULKED ALONG
IN VERY STIFF NECKCLOTHS ON DUTY AT A LARGE PRIVATE DOOR WITH A HEARSE DRAWN BY FOUR BLACK STEEDS APPROACHING IN THE DISTANCE THE SHOP WAS CLOSE AND HOT
FOR THE PASSAGE OF A HUMAN BODY THE KENNEL WAS STAGNANT AND FILTHY THE VERY RATS WHICH HERE AND THERE LAY PUTREFYING IN ITS ROTTENNESS WERE HIDEOUS WITH FAMINE
AND FLOUNCED OUT OF THE SHOP WHY HE WAS SO ANGRY OLIVER THAT HE FORGOT EVEN TO ASK AFTER YOU SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY LOOKING AFTER THE BEADLE AS HE STRODE DOWN THE STREET YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER WHO HAD CAREFULLY KEPT HIMSELF OUT OF SIGHT
REQUIRES THAT THEY SHOULD DECLARE THE CAUSES WHICH IMPEL THEM TO THE SEPARATION WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL
AND THE SOUND OF THE OLD DEEP BELL TO SOOTHE HIM IN HIS SLEEP OLIVER WAS AWAKENED IN THE MORNING BY A LOUD KICKING AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHOP DOOR WHICH BEFORE HE COULD HUDDLE ON HIS CLOTHES WAS REPEATED
REPLIED MISSUS SOWERBERRY IN AN AFFECTING MANNER ASK SOMEBODY ELSE'S HERE THERE WAS ANOTHER HYSTERICAL LAUGH WHICH FRIGHTENED MISTER SOWERBERRY VERY MUCH THIS IS A VERY COMMON AND MUCH APPROVED MATRIMONIAL COURSE OF TREATMENT WHICH IS OFTEN VERY EFFECTIVE
THE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF THE THIRTEEN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHEN IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS IT BECOMES NECESSARY FOR ONE PEOPLE TO DISSOLVE THE POLITICAL BANDS WHICH HAVE CONNECTED THEM WITH ANOTHER
THE OCCASION WAS NOT LONG IN COMING HALF AN HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING MISTER BUMBLE ENTERED THE SHOP AND SUPPORTING HIS CANE AGAINST THE COUNTER DREW FORTH HIS LARGE LEATHERN POCKET BOOK
HE HAS OBSTRUCTED THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BY REFUSING HIS ASSENT TO LAWS FOR ESTABLISHING JUDICIARY POWERS HE HAS MADE JUDGES DEPENDENT ON HIS WILL ALONE FOR THE TENURE OF THEIR OFFICES
THAT THESE UNITED COLONIES ARE AND OF RIGHT OUGHT TO BE FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES THAT THEY ARE ABSOLVED FROM ALL ALLEGIANCE TO THE BRITISH CROWN
HE HAS COMBINED WITH OTHERS TO SUBJECT US TO A JURISDICTION FOREIGN TO OUR CONSTITUTION AND UNACKNOWLEDGED BY OUR LAWS GIVING HIS ASSENT TO THEIR ACTS OF PRETENDED LEGISLATION
HAVING UNLOOSENED THE CRAVAT OF THE MAN WHO STILL REMAINED EXTENDED ON THE GROUND SHE TOTTERED TOWARDS THE UNDERTAKER SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER SAID THE OLD WOMAN
FOR QUARTERING LARGE BODIES OF ARMED TROOPS AMONG US FOR PROTECTING THEM BY A MOCK TRIAL FROM PUNISHMENT FOR ANY MURDERS WHICH THEY SHOULD COMMIT ON THE INHABITANTS OF THESE STATES
HE DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE OLD WOMAN'S GRASP AND DRAWING OLIVER AFTER HIM HURRIED AWAY THE NEXT DAY THE FAMILY HAVING BEEN MEANWHILE RELIEVED WITH A HALF QUARTERN LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE LEFT WITH THEM BY MISTER BUMBLE HIMSELF
HE HAS EXCITED DOMESTIC INSURRECTIONS AMONGST US AND HAS ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ON THE INHABITANTS OF OUR FRONTIERS THE MERCILESS INDIAN SAVAGES
BUT WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE WHAT'S THE UNGRATEFUL BEHAVIOUR OF THESE REBELS SIR WHY THE HUSBAND SENDS BACK WORD THAT THE MEDICINE WON'T SUIT HIS WIFE'S COMPLAINT AND SO SHE SHAN'T TAKE IT
WE HAVE REMINDED THEM OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EMIGRATION AND SETTLEMENT HERE WE HAVE APPEALED TO THEIR NATIVE JUSTICE AND MAGNANIMITY AND WE HAVE CONJURED THEM BY THE TIES OF OUR COMMON KINDRED TO DISAVOW THESE USURPATIONS
IT AT ONCE REDUCED MISTER SOWERBERRY TO BEGGING AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT MISSUS SOWERBERRY WAS MOST CURIOUS TO HEAR AFTER A SHORT DURATION THE PERMISSION WAS MOST GRACIOUSLY CONCEDED
THE CLERGYMAN HAD NOT ARRIVED AND THE CLERK WHO WAS SITTING BY THE VESTRY ROOM FIRE SEEMED TO THINK IT BY NO MEANS IMPROBABLE THAT IT MIGHT BE AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE HE CAME SO THEY PUT THE BIER ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE
AS MISSUS SOWERBERRY SAID THIS SHE GAVE AN HYSTERICAL LAUGH WHICH THREATENED VIOLENT CONSEQUENCES BUT MY DEAR SAID SOWERBERRY I WANT TO ASK YOUR ADVICE NO NO DON'T ASK MINE
RESUMED MISTER SOWERBERRY WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING HE WOULD MAKE A DELIGHTFUL MUTE MY LOVE MISSUS SOWERBERRY LOOKED UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONSIDERABLE WONDERMENT
NOT AT ALL MY DEAR SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY HUMBLY I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR MY DEAR I WAS ONLY GOING TO SAY OH DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY INTERPOSED MISSUS SOWERBERRY I AM NOBODY DON'T CONSULT ME PRAY
IMPRESSED WITH THE BELIEF THAT THE UNKNOWN WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM THROUGH THE KEY HOLE HAD WALKED A FEW PACES OFF TO WARM HIMSELF FOR NOBODY DID HE SEE BUT A BIG CHARITY BOY SITTING ON A POST IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE EATING A SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER
WHO HAVING CONSOLED HIM WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HE'D CATCH IT CONDESCENDED TO HELP HIM MISTER SOWERBERRY CAME DOWN SOON AFTER SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MISSUS SOWERBERRY APPEARED OLIVER HAVING CAUGHT IT IN FULFILMENT OF NOAH'S PREDICTION
THE UNDERTAKER TURNED TO GO AWAY STOP STOP SAID THE OLD WOMAN IN A LOUD WHISPER WILL SHE BE BURIED TO MORROW OR NEXT DAY OR TO NIGHT
BUT NOW THAT FORTUNE HAD CAST IN HIS WAY A NAMELESS ORPHAN AT WHOM EVEN THE MEANEST COULD POINT THE FINGER OF SCORN HE RETORTED ON HIM WITH INTEREST THIS AFFORDS CHARMING FOOD FOR CONTEMPLATION IT SHOWS US WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING HUMAN NATURE MAY BE MADE TO BE
NOR HAVE WE BEEN WANTING IN ATTENTION TO OUR BRITTISH BRETHREN WE HAVE WARNED THEM FROM TIME TO TIME OF ATTEMPTS BY THEIR LEGISLATURE TO EXTEND AN UNWARRANTABLE JURISDICTION OVER US
SHOULDERED HIS SPADE AND WALKED OFF FOLLOWED BY THE BOYS WHO MURMURED VERY LOUD COMPLAINTS AT THE FUN BEING OVER SO SOON COME MY GOOD FELLOW SAID BUMBLE TAPPING THE MAN ON THE BACK THEY WANT TO SHUT UP THE YARD
ONLY A LOAF OF BREAD AND A CUP OF WATER SHALL WE HAVE SOME BREAD DEAR SHE SAID EAGERLY CATCHING AT THE UNDERTAKER'S COAT AS HE ONCE MORE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR
WERE TAKING THEIR SUPPER IN THE LITTLE BACK PARLOUR WHEN MISTER SOWERBERRY AFTER SEVERAL DEFERENTIAL GLANCES AT HIS WIFE SAID MY DEAR HE WAS GOING TO SAY MORE BUT MISSUS SOWERBERRY LOOKING UP WITH A PECULIARLY UNPROPITIOUS ASPECT
TRANSPORTING LARGE ARMIES OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES TO COMPLEAT THE WORKS OF DEATH DESOLATION AND TYRANNY ALREADY BEGUN WITH CIRCUMSTANCES OF CRUELTY AND PERFIDY SCARCELY PARALLELED IN THE MOST BARBAROUS AGES
WHICH MANY PEOPLE A GOOD DEAL OLDER THAN HE WILL BE AT NO LOSS TO UNDERSTAND AN UNFINISHED COFFIN ON BLACK TRESSELS WHICH STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP LOOKED SO GLOOMY AND DEATH LIKE
SAYS SHE SHAN'T TAKE IT SIR GOOD STRONG WHOLESOME MEDICINE AS WAS GIVEN WITH GREAT SUCCESS TO TWO IRISH LABOURERS AND A COAL HEAVER
OLIVER AND HIS MASTER RETURNED TO THE MISERABLE ABODE WHERE MISTER BUMBLE HAD ALREADY ARRIVED ACCOMPANIED BY FOUR MEN FROM THE WORKHOUSE WHO WERE TO ACT AS BEARERS AN OLD BLACK CLOAK HAD BEEN THROWN OVER THE RAGS OF THE OLD WOMAN AND THE MAN
LORD WELL IT IS STRANGE THAT I WHO GAVE BIRTH TO HER AND WAS A WOMAN THEN SHOULD BE ALIVE AND MERRY NOW AND SHE LYING THERE SO COLD AND STIFF
FOR THOUGH IT WAS COVERED UP THE BOY FELT THAT IT WAS A CORPSE THE MAN'S FACE WAS THIN AND VERY PALE HIS HAIR AND BEARD WERE GRIZZLY HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT
AGAINST THE WALL WERE RANGED IN REGULAR ARRAY A LONG ROW OF ELM BOARDS CUT IN THE SAME SHAPE LOOKING IN THE DIM LIGHT LIKE HIGH SHOULDERED GHOSTS WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR BREECHES POCKETS
HE HAS ENDEAVOURED TO PREVENT THE POPULATION OF THESE STATES
THERE WAS NOT SO GREAT A NECESSITY FOR HURRYING AS MISTER SOWERBERRY HAD ANTICIPATED HOWEVER FOR WHEN THEY REACHED THE OBSCURE CORNER OF THE CHURCHYARD IN WHICH THE NETTLES GREW AND WHERE THE PARISH GRAVES WERE MADE
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ABSOLUTE TYRANNY OVER THESE STATES TO PROVE THIS LET FACTS BE SUBMITTED TO A CANDID WORLD HE HAS REFUSED HIS ASSENT TO LAWS THE MOST WHOLESOME AND NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD
HE TWINED HIS HANDS IN HIS HAIR AND WITH A LOUD SCREAM ROLLED GROVELLING UPON THE FLOOR HIS EYES FIXED AND THE FOAM COVERING HIS LIPS
THERE WAS NO FIRE IN THE ROOM BUT A MAN WAS CROUCHING MECHANICALLY OVER THE EMPTY STOVE AN OLD WOMAN TOO HAD DRAWN A LOW STOOL TO THE COLD HEARTH AND WAS SITTING BESIDE HIM THERE WERE SOME RAGGED CHILDREN IN ANOTHER CORNER
I LAID HER OUT AND I MUST WALK
FROM WHICH HE SELECTED A SMALL SCRAP OF PAPER WHICH HE HANDED OVER TO SOWERBERRY AHA SAID THE UNDERTAKER GLANCING OVER IT WITH A LIVELY COUNTENANCE
NEVER DID SIR EJACULATED THE BEADLE NO NOR NOBODY NEVER DID BUT NOW SHE'S DEAD WE'VE GOT TO BURY HER AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION AND THE SOONER IT'S DONE THE BETTER
IT'S ONLY ABOUT YOUNG TWIST MY DEAR SAID MISTER SOWERBERRY A VERY GOOD LOOKING BOY THAT MY DEAR HE NEED BE FOR HE EATS ENOUGH OBSERVED THE LADY THERE'S AN EXPRESSION OF MELANCHOLY IN HIS FACE MY DEAR
NODDING HER HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CORPSE AND SPEAKING WITH AN IDIOTIC LEER MORE GHASTLY THAN EVEN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH IN SUCH A PLACE LORD
THE UNDERTAKER OFFERED NO REPLY TO THIS RAVING
OUR REPEATED PETITIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED ONLY BY REPEATED INJURY A PRINCE WHOSE CHARACTER IS THUS MARKED BY EVERY ACT WHICH MAY DEFINE A TYRANT IS UNFIT TO BE THE RULER OF A FREE PEOPLE
FOR A COFFIN FIRST AND A POROCHIAL FUNERAL AFTERWARDS REPLIED MISTER BUMBLE FASTENING THE STRAP OF THE LEATHERN POCKET BOOK
AND TO ASSUME AMONG THE POWERS OF THE EARTH THE SEPARATE AND EQUAL STATION TO WHICH THE LAWS OF NATURE AND OF NATURE'S GOD ENTITLE THEM A DECENT RESPECT TO THE OPINIONS OF MANKIND
THEY SEEMED SO LIKE THE RATS HE HAD SEEN OUTSIDE
HE HAS CONSTRAINED OUR FELLOW CITIZENS TAKEN CAPTIVE ON THE HIGH SEAS TO BEAR ARMS AGAINST THEIR COUNTRY TO BECOME THE EXECUTIONERS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND BRETHREN OR TO FALL THEMSELVES BY THEIR HANDS
AND THE GREAT WARSHIP LIGHTENED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE LOOT SOARED MAJESTICALLY INTO THE AIR HER DECKS AND UPPER WORKS A MASS OF ROARING FLAMES SLOWLY SHE DRIFTED TO THE SOUTHEAST RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER AS THE FLAMES ATE AWAY HER WOODEN PARTS
THE LAST WARRIOR TO LEAVE THE DECK TURNED AND THREW SOMETHING BACK UPON THE VESSEL WAITING AN INSTANT TO NOTE THE OUTCOME OF HIS ACT AS A FAINT SPURT OF FLAME ROSE FROM THE POINT WHERE THE MISSILE STRUCK HE SWUNG OVER THE SIDE AND WAS QUICKLY UPON THE GROUND
AND EXHIBIT HER LAST AGONIES AT THE GREAT GAMES BEFORE TAL HAJUS REPLIED SARKOJA WHAT WILL BE THE MANNER OF HER GOING OUT INQUIRED SOLA SHE IS VERY SMALL AND VERY BEAUTIFUL I HAD HOPED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD HER FOR RANSOM
FOR EXAMPLE A PROPORTION OF THEM ALWAYS THE BEST MARKSMEN DIRECT THEIR FIRE ENTIRELY UPON THE WIRELESS FINDING AND SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE BIG GUNS OF AN ATTACKING NAVAL FORCE ANOTHER DETAIL ATTENDS TO THE SMALLER GUNS IN THE SAME WAY
MY BREATH WAS COMING IN QUICK SHORT GASPS COLD SWEAT STOOD OUT FROM EVERY PORE OF MY BODY AND THE ANCIENT EXPERIMENT OF PINCHING REVEALED THE FACT THAT I WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A WRAITH
IT IS ONLY THE MEN OF HER KIND WHO WAR UPON US AND I HAVE EVER THOUGHT THAT THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD US IS BUT THE REFLECTION OF OURS TOWARD THEM THEY LIVE AT PEACE WITH ALL THEIR FELLOWS EXCEPT WHEN DUTY CALLS UPON THEM TO MAKE WAR WHILE WE ARE AT PEACE WITH NONE
HER SKIN WAS OF A LIGHT REDDISH COPPER COLOR AGAINST WHICH THE CRIMSON GLOW OF HER CHEEKS AND THE RUBY OF HER BEAUTIFULLY MOLDED LIPS SHONE WITH A STRANGELY ENHANCING EFFECT SHE WAS AS DESTITUTE OF CLOTHES AS THE GREEN MARTIANS WHO ACCOMPANIED HER
AS I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD CARE TO ENTRUST SUCH AS YOU WITH THE GRAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF MATERNITY I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH MY EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN THIS RED WOMAN RETORTED SOLA SHE HAS NEVER HARMED US NOR WOULD SHE SHOULD WE HAVE FALLEN INTO HER HANDS
AND TO FULLY UNDERSTAND PRACTICALLY ALL THAT I HEARD AT THIS TIME OUR SLEEPING QUARTERS WERE OCCUPIED BY THREE OR FOUR FEMALES AND A COUPLE OF THE RECENTLY HATCHED YOUNG BESIDE SOLA AND HER YOUTHFUL WARD MYSELF AND WOOLA THE HOUND
I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT THERE WERE ANY BETTER CONDITIONS TO ESCAPE TO BUT I WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE MY CHANCES AMONG PEOPLE FASHIONED AFTER MY OWN MOLD RATHER THAN TO REMAIN LONGER AMONG THE HIDEOUS AND BLOODTHIRSTY GREEN MEN OF MARS
HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE AUDIENCE AS ONE OF THE CAPTIVE'S GUARDS AND IT WAS TOWARD HER THE QUESTION TURNED WHEN ASKED ONE OF THE WOMEN WILL WE ENJOY THE DEATH THROES OF THE RED ONE OR DOES LORQUAS PTOMEL JED INTEND HOLDING HER FOR RANSOM
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON MY HORSE WHICH HAD BEEN STANDING WITH DRAGGING REIN BEFORE THE CAVE STARTED SLOWLY DOWN THE TRAIL EVIDENTLY IN SEARCH OF FOOD AND WATER AND I WAS LEFT ALONE WITH MY MYSTERIOUS UNKNOWN COMPANION AND THE DEAD BODY OF MY FRIEND
INSTANTLY THE WARRIORS CEASED FIRING
FROM THEN ON SOLA INSTRUCTED ME IN THE MYSTERIES OF THE VARIOUS WEAPONS AND WITH THE MARTIAN YOUNG I SPENT SEVERAL HOURS EACH DAY PRACTICING UPON THE PLAZA
OR OF REINFORCEMENTS IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT SHE WOULD STRIKE THE FACE OF THE BUILDINGS ABOUT A MILE SOUTH OF OUR POSITION AND AS I WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF THE CHASE I SAW A NUMBER OF WARRIORS GALLOP AHEAD DISMOUNT AND ENTER THE BUILDING SHE SEEMED DESTINED TO TOUCH
AND SAVAGE EYES LOOKED INTO MINE THAT HE COULD SEE ME IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE CAVE I WAS SURE FOR THE EARLY MORNING SUN WAS FALLING FULL UPON ME THROUGH THE OPENING THE FELLOW INSTEAD OF APPROACHING MERELY STOOD AND STARED
SARKOJA AND THE OTHER WOMEN GRUNTED ANGRILY AT THIS EVIDENCE OF WEAKNESS ON THE PART OF SOLA IT IS SAD SOLA THAT YOU WERE NOT BORN A MILLION YEARS AGO SNAPPED SARKOJA WHEN ALL THE HOLLOWS OF THE LAND WERE FILLED WITH WATER
A SIGN WHICH I DID NOT OF COURSE UNDERSTAND JUST A MOMENT WE GAZED UPON EACH OTHER AND THEN THE LOOK OF HOPE AND RENEWED COURAGE WHICH HAD GLORIFIED HER FACE AS SHE DISCOVERED ME FADED INTO ONE OF UTTER DEJECTION MINGLED WITH LOATHING AND CONTEMPT
AND AS MY HORSE HAD WANDERED OFF I WAS LEFT WITHOUT MEANS OF DEFENSE MY ONLY ALTERNATIVE SEEMED TO LIE IN FLIGHT
I MOUNTED TO AN UPPER FLOOR AND PEERED FROM THE WINDOW OUT OVER THE VALLEY AND THE HILLS BEYOND AND THERE I SAW THE CAUSE OF THEIR SUDDEN SCURRYING TO COVER A HUGE CRAFT LONG LOW AND GRAY PAINTED SWUNG SLOWLY OVER THE CREST OF THE NEAREST HILL
THEY HAVE NO LAWYERS I DID NOT SEE THE PRISONER AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER AND THEN ONLY TO CATCH A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF HER AS SHE WAS BEING CONDUCTED TO THE GREAT AUDIENCE CHAMBER WHERE I HAD HAD MY FIRST MEETING WITH LORQUAS PTOMEL
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE STILL WAS TOO HIGH FOR THEM TO HOPE TO REACH HER DECKS FROM MY VANTAGE POINT IN THE WINDOW I COULD SEE THE BODIES OF HER CREW STREWN ABOUT ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT MANNER OF CREATURES THEY MIGHT BE
I COULD SEE THEM EXAMINING THE DEAD SAILORS EVIDENTLY FOR SIGNS OF LIFE AND PRESENTLY A PARTY OF THEM APPEARED FROM BELOW DRAGGING A LITTLE FIGURE AMONG THEM THE CREATURE WAS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN HALF AS TALL AS THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS
AND SEEMED BUT BARELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THEIR DEPLETED CREWS THEIR FIRE HAD CEASED ENTIRELY AND ALL THEIR ENERGIES SEEMED FOCUSED UPON ESCAPE OUR WARRIORS THEN RUSHED UP TO THE ROOFS OF THE BUILDINGS WHICH WE OCCUPIED
SUDDENLY A LOW BUT DISTINCT MOANING SOUND ISSUED FROM THE RECESSES OF THE CAVE BEHIND ME AND AS IT REACHED THE EARS OF THE INDIANS THEY TURNED AND FLED IN TERROR PANIC STRICKEN SO FRANTIC WERE THEIR EFFORTS TO ESCAPE FROM THE UNSEEN THING BEHIND ME
AND THEN COMMENCED A SYSTEMATIC RIFLING OF THE VESSEL THIS OPERATION REQUIRED SEVERAL HOURS DURING WHICH TIME A NUMBER OF THE CHARIOTS WERE REQUISITIONED TO TRANSPORT THE LOOT WHICH CONSISTED IN ARMS AMMUNITION SILKS FURS JEWELS STRANGELY CARVED STONE VESSELS
EACH CARRIED A STRANGE BANNER SWUNG FROM STEM TO STERN ABOVE THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE PROW OF EACH WAS PAINTED SOME ODD DEVICE THAT GLEAMED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND SHOWED PLAINLY EVEN AT THE DISTANCE AT WHICH WE WERE FROM THE VESSELS
I DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE BUT FIRST I LIFTED MY HEAD TO FILL MY LUNGS WITH THE PURE INVIGORATING NIGHT AIR OF THE MOUNTAINS AS I DID SO I SAW STRETCHING FAR BELOW ME THE BEAUTIFUL VISTA OF ROCKY GORGE AND LEVEL CACTI STUDDED FLAT
I COULD SEE FIGURES CROWDING THE FORWARD DECKS AND UPPER WORKS OF THE AIR CRAFT WHETHER THEY HAD DISCOVERED US OR SIMPLY WERE LOOKING AT THE DESERTED CITY I COULD NOT SAY BUT IN ANY EVENT THEY RECEIVED A RUDE RECEPTION FOR SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING
AND THE PEOPLES WERE AS SOFT AS THE STUFF THEY SAILED UPON IN OUR DAY WE HAVE PROGRESSED TO A POINT WHERE SUCH SENTIMENTS MARK WEAKNESS AND ATAVISM IT WILL NOT BE WELL FOR YOU TO PERMIT TARS TARKAS TO LEARN THAT YOU HOLD SUCH DEGENERATE SENTIMENTS
THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS FIRED A TERRIFIC VOLLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS FACING THE LITTLE VALLEY ACROSS WHICH THE GREAT SHIPS WERE SO PEACEFULLY ADVANCING INSTANTLY THE SCENE CHANGED AS BY MAGIC
I ATTEMPTED TO SPRING TO MY FEET BUT WAS HORRIFIED TO DISCOVER THAT MY MUSCLES REFUSED TO RESPOND TO MY WILL I WAS NOW THOROUGHLY AWAKE BUT AS UNABLE TO MOVE A MUSCLE AS THOUGH TURNED TO STONE IT WAS THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME
OWING TO THE FEAR OF A RETURN ATTACK BY THE AIR CRAFT LORQUAS PTOMEL WAS TOO ASTUTE AN OLD WARRIOR TO BE CAUGHT UPON THE OPEN PLAINS WITH A CARAVAN OF CHARIOTS AND CHILDREN AND SO WE REMAINED AT THE DESERTED CITY UNTIL THE DANGER SEEMED PASSED
THIS HAD RECEIVED THE BRUNT OF OUR FIRE AND SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY UNMANNED AS NOT A MOVING FIGURE WAS VISIBLE UPON HER DECKS SLOWLY SHE SWUNG FROM HER COURSE
IT WAS AN EFFORT OF THE MIND OF THE WILL OF THE NERVES NOT MUSCULAR FOR I COULD NOT MOVE EVEN SO MUCH AS MY LITTLE FINGER BUT NONE THE LESS MIGHTY FOR ALL THAT AND THEN SOMETHING GAVE THERE WAS A MOMENTARY FEELING OF NAUSEA
AND HER EYES MET MINE HER FACE WAS OVAL AND BEAUTIFUL IN THE EXTREME HER EVERY FEATURE WAS FINELY CHISELED AND EXQUISITE HER EYES LARGE AND LUSTROUS AND HER HEAD SURMOUNTED BY A MASS OF COAL BLACK WAVING HAIR
AND I WAS LEFT TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF MY POSITION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION I COULD BUT VAGUELY CONJECTURE THE CAUSE OF MY PARALYSIS AND MY ONLY HOPE LAY IN THAT IT MIGHT PASS OFF AS SUDDENLY AS IT HAD FALLEN UPON ME
I KNEW THAT SHE WAS FOND OF ME AND NOW THAT I HAD DISCOVERED THAT SHE HATED CRUELTY AND BARBARITY I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I COULD DEPEND UPON HER TO AID ME AND THE GIRL CAPTIVE TO ESCAPE PROVIDED OF COURSE THAT SUCH A THING WAS WITHIN THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES
FACING MY UNKNOWN FOE AND THEN THE MOONLIGHT FLOODED THE CAVE
AS I COULD NOT BUT RECALL THE STRANGE EXPRESSION I HAD NOTED UPON HER FACE AFTER MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE PRISONER THAT IT DENOTED JEALOUSY I COULD NOT SAY AND YET JUDGING ALL THINGS BY MUNDANE STANDARDS AS I STILL DID
AND THE SIGHT WHICH MET MY EYES WAS THAT OF A SLENDER GIRLISH FIGURE SIMILAR IN EVERY DETAIL TO THE EARTHLY WOMEN OF MY PAST LIFE SHE DID NOT SEE ME AT FIRST BUT JUST AS SHE WAS DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE PORTAL OF THE BUILDING WHICH WAS TO BE HER PRISON SHE TURNED
THE OTHER VESSELS FOLLOWED IN HER WAKE EACH ONE OPENING UPON US AS SHE SWUNG INTO POSITION OUR OWN FIRE NEVER DIMINISHED AND I DOUBT IF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR SHOTS WENT WILD
THAN ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOR AN IMMEDIATE AND HASTY RETURN AS THOUGH TRAINED FOR YEARS IN THIS PARTICULAR EVOLUTION THE GREEN MARTIANS MELTED LIKE MIST INTO THE SPACIOUS DOORWAYS OF THE NEARBY BUILDINGS UNTIL IN LESS THAN THREE MINUTES
HE CAN METE OUT NO WORSE FATE TO ME THAN A CONTINUATION OF THE HORRIBLE EXISTENCE WE ARE FORCED TO LEAD IN THIS LIFE THIS WILD OUTBREAK ON THE PART OF SOLA SO GREATLY SURPRISED AND SHOCKED THE OTHER WOMEN THAT AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GENERAL REPRIMAND
AND A BEARING AT ONCE RESPECTFUL AND MENACING LATER SOLA WITH THE AID OF SEVERAL OF THE OTHER WOMEN REMODELED THE TRAPPINGS TO FIT MY LESSER PROPORTIONS AND AFTER THEY COMPLETED THE WORK I WENT ABOUT GARBED IN ALL THE PANOPLY OF WAR
MUCH DEPRESSED AND TO ME UNACCOUNTABLY SO I SLOWLY DESCENDED TO THE STREET THE SCENE I HAD WITNESSED SEEMED TO MARK THE DEFEAT AND ANNIHILATION OF THE FORCES OF A KINDRED PEOPLE
I HAD OBSERVED ON THE TWO OCCASIONS WHEN I HAD SEEN HER THAT THE PRISONER EXCHANGED WORDS WITH HER GUARDS AND THIS CONVINCED ME THAT THEY SPOKE
INDEED SAVE FOR HER HIGHLY WROUGHT ORNAMENTS SHE WAS ENTIRELY NAKED NOR COULD ANY APPAREL HAVE ENHANCED THE BEAUTY OF HER PERFECT AND SYMMETRICAL FIGURE AS HER GAZE RESTED ON ME HER EYES OPENED WIDE IN ASTONISHMENT AND SHE MADE A LITTLE SIGN WITH HER FREE HAND
TO THE UNEXPECTED SUDDENNESS OF THE FIRST VOLLEY WHICH CAUGHT THE SHIP'S CREWS ENTIRELY UNPREPARED AND THE SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE GUNS UNPROTECTED FROM THE DEADLY AIM OF OUR WARRIORS
THAT I NOTICED A SLIGHT VAPOR FILLING THE CAVE IT WAS EXTREMELY TENUOUS AND ONLY NOTICEABLE AGAINST THE OPENING WHICH LED TO DAYLIGHT THERE ALSO CAME TO MY NOSTRILS A FAINTLY PUNGENT ODOR AND I COULD ONLY ASSUME THAT I HAD BEEN OVERCOME BY SOME POISONOUS GAS
WITH THE EYES STARING TOWARD THE OPEN LEDGE AND THE HANDS RESTING LIMPLY UPON THE GROUND I LOOKED FIRST AT MY LIFELESS CLAY THERE UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CAVE AND THEN DOWN AT MYSELF IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT FOR THERE I LAY CLOTHED
I REALIZED I HAD NOT ANSWERED HER SIGNAL AND IGNORANT AS I WAS OF MARTIAN CUSTOMS I INTUITIVELY FELT THAT SHE HAD MADE AN APPEAL FOR SUCCOR AND PROTECTION WHICH MY UNFORTUNATE IGNORANCE HAD PREVENTED ME FROM ANSWERING
I HAD NO DESIRE TO FACE THE UNSEEN THING WHICH MENACED ME MY REVOLVERS WERE STRAPPED TO MY LIFELESS BODY WHICH FOR SOME UNFATHOMABLE REASON I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO TOUCH MY CARBINE WAS IN ITS BOOT STRAPPED TO MY SADDLE
I FELT IT SAFER TO AFFECT INDIFFERENCE IN THE MATTER UNTIL I LEARNED MORE SURELY SOLA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE OBJECT OF MY SOLICITUDE SARKOJA
THEY ALL LAPSED INTO SILENCE AND WERE SOON ASLEEP ONE THING THE EPISODE HAD ACCOMPLISHED WAS TO ASSURE ME OF SOLA'S FRIENDLINESS TOWARD THE POOR GIRL AND ALSO TO CONVINCE ME THAT I HAD BEEN EXTREMELY FORTUNATE IN FALLING INTO HER HANDS RATHER THAN THOSE OF SOME OF THE OTHER FEMALES
WHICH LAY JUST WITHIN MY RANGE OF VISION UPON THE LEDGE WHERE I HAD PLACED IT IN THE EARLY MORNING FROM THEN UNTIL POSSIBLY MIDNIGHT ALL WAS SILENCE THE SILENCE OF THE DEAD THEN SUDDENLY THE AWFUL MOAN OF THE MORNING BROKE UPON MY STARTLED EARS
RATHER THAN THE ROUTING BY OUR GREEN WARRIORS OF A HORDE OF SIMILAR THOUGH UNFRIENDLY CREATURES I COULD NOT FATHOM THE SEEMING HALLUCINATION NOR COULD I FREE MYSELF FROM IT BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF MY SOUL I FELT A STRANGE YEARNING TOWARD THESE UNKNOWN FOEMEN
HIS EYES BULGING AND HIS JAW DROPPED AND THEN ANOTHER SAVAGE FACE APPEARED AND A THIRD AND FOURTH AND FIFTH CRANING THEIR NECKS OVER THE SHOULDERS OF THEIR FELLOWS WHOM THEY COULD NOT PASS UPON THE NARROW LEDGE
FOR A MAN WHO HAD EVER BEEN USED TO FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE WITH ALL THE ENERGY OF A POWERFUL PHYSIQUE SEVERAL TIMES I THOUGHT I HEARD FAINT SOUNDS BEHIND ME AS OF SOMEBODY MOVING CAUTIOUSLY BUT EVENTUALLY EVEN THESE CEASED
BUT WHY I SHOULD RETAIN MY MENTAL FACULTIES AND YET BE UNABLE TO MOVE I COULD NOT FATHOM I LAY FACING THE OPENING OF THE CAVE AND WHERE I COULD SEE THE SHORT STRETCH OF TRAIL WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE CAVE AND THE TURN OF THE CLIFF AROUND WHICH THE TRAIL LED
AS SOLA AND I ENTERED THE PLAZA A SIGHT MET MY EYES WHICH FILLED MY WHOLE BEING WITH A GREAT SURGE OF MINGLED HOPE FEAR EXULTATION AND DEPRESSION AND YET MOST DOMINANT WAS A SUBTLE SENSE OF RELIEF AND HAPPINESS
AND AS I EMERGED UPON THE STREET SOLA RUSHED UP TO ME AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF SOME SEARCH ON HER PART THE CAVALCADE WAS RETURNING TO THE PLAZA THE HOMEWARD MARCH HAVING BEEN GIVEN UP FOR THAT DAY NOR IN FACT WAS IT RECOMMENCED FOR MORE THAN A WEEK
CONVINCED ME THAT THE NOISES I HAD HEARD MUST HAVE RESULTED FROM PURELY NATURAL AND HARMLESS CAUSES
AND YET HERE I STOOD BUT NAKED AS AT THE MINUTE OF MY BIRTH THE TRANSITION HAD BEEN SO SUDDEN AND SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT LEFT ME FOR A MOMENT FORGETFUL OF AUGHT ELSE THAN MY STRANGE METAMORPHOSIS MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS
AS I CAME BACK TO MYSELF I GLANCED AT SOLA WHO HAD WITNESSED THIS ENCOUNTER AND I WAS SURPRISED TO NOTE A STRANGE EXPRESSION UPON HER USUALLY EXPRESSIONLESS COUNTENANCE WHAT HER THOUGHTS WERE I DID NOT KNOW FOR AS YET I HAD LEARNED BUT LITTLE OF THE MARTIAN TONGUE
BUT IT HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT AS IT WAS TO START ME SPECULATING ON THE POSSIBLE HORROR WHICH LURKED IN THE SHADOWS AT MY BACK FEAR IS A RELATIVE TERM AND SO I CAN ONLY MEASURE MY FEELINGS AT THAT TIME BY WHAT I HAD EXPERIENCED IN PREVIOUS POSITIONS OF DANGER AND BY THOSE THAT I HAVE PASSED THROUGH SINCE
THE STRANGE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS UPON HOG BACK AND ARROYO AND THE GROTESQUE DETAILS OF THE STIFF YET BEAUTIFUL CACTI FORM A PICTURE AT ONCE ENCHANTING AND INSPIRING AS THOUGH ONE WERE CATCHING FOR THE FIRST TIME A GLIMPSE OF SOME DEAD AND FORGOTTEN WORLD
AND FAR FROM BEING IN A POSITION TO INFLICT HARM UPON US SHE COULD NOT EVEN CONTROL HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE AS SHE NEARED THE CITY THE WARRIORS RUSHED OUT UPON THE PLAIN TO MEET HER
CHAPTER EIGHT A FAIR CAPTIVE FROM THE SKY THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE INCUBATOR CEREMONY WE SET FORTH TOWARD HOME BUT SCARCELY HAD THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION DEBOUCHED INTO THE OPEN GROUND BEFORE THE CITY
FOREVER WARRING AMONG OUR OWN KIND AS WELL AS UPON THE RED MEN AND EVEN IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES THE INDIVIDUALS FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES OH IT IS ONE CONTINUAL AWFUL PERIOD OF BLOODSHED FROM THE TIME WE BREAK THE SHELL UNTIL WE GLADLY EMBRACE THE BOSOM OF THE RIVER OF MYSTERY
WITH THIS ADDED INCENTIVE I NEARLY DROVE SOLA DISTRACTED BY MY IMPORTUNITIES TO HASTEN ON MY EDUCATION AND WITHIN A FEW MORE DAYS I HAD MASTERED THE MARTIAN TONGUE SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO ENABLE ME TO CARRY ON A PASSABLE CONVERSATION
WITH ONE'S BACK TOWARD SOME HORRIBLE AND UNKNOWN DANGER FROM THE VERY SOUND OF WHICH THE FEROCIOUS APACHE WARRIORS TURN IN WILD STAMPEDE AS A FLOCK OF SHEEP WOULD MADLY FLEE FROM A PACK OF WOLVES SEEMS TO ME THE LAST WORD IN FEARSOME PREDICAMENTS
AND WHEN THE NECESSITY ARISES FIGHT WITH EVEN GREATER INTELLIGENCE AND FEROCITY THAN THE MEN THE MEN ARE TRAINED IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF THE ART OF WAR IN STRATEGY AND THE MANEUVERING OF LARGE BODIES OF TROOPS
SO DIFFERENT IS IT FROM THE ASPECT OF ANY OTHER SPOT UPON OUR EARTH AS I STOOD THUS MEDITATING I TURNED MY GAZE FROM THE LANDSCAPE TO THE HEAVENS WHERE THE MYRIAD STARS FORMED A GORGEOUS AND FITTING CANOPY FOR THE WONDERS OF THE EARTHLY SCENE
I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE UNNECESSARY HARSHNESS AND BRUTALITY WITH WHICH HER GUARDS TREATED HER SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ALMOST MATERNAL KINDLINESS WHICH SOLA MANIFESTED TOWARD ME AND THE RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE OF THE FEW GREEN MARTIANS WHO TOOK THE TROUBLE TO NOTICE ME AT ALL
I CLOSED MY EYES STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS TOWARD THE GOD OF MY VOCATION AND FELT MYSELF DRAWN WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF THOUGHT THROUGH THE TRACKLESS IMMENSITY OF SPACE
AFTER THE LAST LOAD HAD BEEN REMOVED THE WARRIORS MADE LINES FAST TO THE CRAFT AND TOWED HER FAR OUT INTO THE VALLEY IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION A FEW OF THEM THEN BOARDED HER AND WERE BUSILY ENGAGED IN WHAT APPEARED FROM MY DISTANT POSITION
AS THE EMPTYING OF THE CONTENTS OF VARIOUS CARBOYS UPON THE DEAD BODIES OF THE SAILORS AND OVER THE DECKS AND WORKS OF THE VESSEL THIS OPERATION CONCLUDED THEY HASTILY CLAMBERED OVER HER SIDES SLIDING DOWN THE GUY ROPES TO THE GROUND
THE FOREMOST VESSEL SWUNG BROADSIDE TOWARD US AND BRINGING HER GUNS INTO PLAY RETURNED OUR FIRE AT THE SAME TIME MOVING PARALLEL TO OUR FRONT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN TURNING BACK WITH THE EVIDENT INTENTION OF COMPLETING A GREAT CIRCLE WHICH WOULD BRING HER UP TO POSITION ONCE MORE OPPOSITE OUR FIRING LINE
AND IN A FEW MOMENTS THEY HAD THROWN OUT GRAPPLING HOOKS AND THE BIG BOAT WAS BEING HAULED TO GROUND BY THEIR FELLOWS BELOW AFTER MAKING HER FAST THEY SWARMED THE SIDES AND SEARCHED THE VESSEL FROM STEM TO STERN
MY ATTENTION WAS QUICKLY RIVETED BY A LARGE RED STAR CLOSE TO THE DISTANT HORIZON AS I GAZED UPON IT I FELT A SPELL OF OVERPOWERING FASCINATION IT WAS MARS THE GOD OF WAR
AND DIMINISHED THE WEIGHT UPON HER ASCENDING TO THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING I WATCHED HER FOR HOURS UNTIL FINALLY SHE WAS LOST IN THE DIM VISTAS OF THE DISTANCE THE SIGHT WAS AWE INSPIRING IN THE EXTREME AS ONE CONTEMPLATED THIS MIGHTY FLOATING FUNERAL PYRE
IS THIS THEN DEATH HAVE I INDEED PASSED OVER FOREVER INTO THAT OTHER LIFE BUT I COULD NOT WELL BELIEVE THIS AS I COULD FEEL MY HEART POUNDING AGAINST MY RIBS FROM THE EXERTION OF MY EFFORTS TO RELEASE MYSELF FROM THE ANAESTHESIS WHICH HAD HELD ME
AND FOLLOWED THE RETREATING ARMADA WITH A CONTINUOUS FUSILLADE OF DEADLY FIRE ONE BY ONE HOWEVER THE SHIPS MANAGED TO DIP BELOW THE CRESTS OF THE OUTLYING HILLS UNTIL ONLY ONE BARELY MOVING CRAFT WAS IN SIGHT
BUT I CAN SAY WITHOUT SHAME THAT IF THE SENSATIONS I ENDURED DURING THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WERE FEAR THEN MAY GOD HELP THE COWARD FOR COWARDICE IS OF A SURETY ITS OWN PUNISHMENT TO BE HELD PARALYZED
AFTER THEY HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR THE ADULTS TO CARRY ON A DESULTORY CONVERSATION FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE LAPSING INTO SLEEP AND NOW THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE I WAS ALWAYS A KEEN LISTENER ALTHOUGH I NEVER PROFFERED ANY REMARKS MYSELF
AS I DID NOT PARTICULARLY RELISH THE THOUGHT OF THE INNUMERABLE THINGS THEY MIGHT DO TO ME IF THE SPIRIT PROMPTED THEM I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BEFORE A STEALTHY SOUND APPRISED ME OF THEIR NEARNESS AND THEN A WAR BONNETED PAINT STREAKED FACE WAS THRUST CAUTIOUSLY AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE CLIFF
WHILE THE BANNERS AND UPPER WORKS DISSOLVED IN SPURTS OF FLAME AS THE IRRESISTIBLE PROJECTILES OF OUR WARRIORS MOWED THROUGH THEM THE FIRE FROM THE VESSELS WAS MOST INEFFECTUAL OWING AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED
THAT ONE OF THE BRAVES WAS HURLED HEADLONG FROM THE CLIFF TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEIR WILD CRIES ECHOED IN THE CANYON FOR A SHORT TIME AND THEN ALL WAS STILL ONCE MORE THE SOUND WHICH HAD FRIGHTENED THEM WAS NOT REPEATED
THE ENTIRE CAVALCADE OF CHARIOTS MASTODONS AND MOUNTED WARRIORS WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN SOLA AND I HAD ENTERED A BUILDING UPON THE FRONT OF THE CITY IN FACT THE SAME ONE IN WHICH I HAD HAD MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE APES AND WISHING TO SEE WHAT HAD CAUSED THE SUDDEN RETREAT
ON THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE PRISONER'S VISIT TO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THE CONVERSATION FINALLY FELL UPON THIS SUBJECT AND I WAS ALL EARS ON THE INSTANT I HAD FEARED TO QUESTION SOLA RELATIVE TO THE BEAUTIFUL CAPTIVE
THE DARK AND ANCIENT ISS WHICH CARRIES US TO AN UNKNOWN BUT AT LEAST NO MORE FRIGHTFUL AND TERRIBLE EXISTENCE FORTUNATE INDEED IS HE WHO MEETS HIS END IN AN EARLY DEATH SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE TO TARS TARKAS
BUT ARE ALSO THE ARTISANS WHO PRODUCE EVERY MANUFACTURED ARTICLE WROUGHT BY THE GREEN MARTIANS THEY MAKE THE POWDER THE CARTRIDGES THE FIREARMS IN FACT EVERYTHING OF VALUE IS PRODUCED BY THE FEMALES IN TIME OF ACTUAL WARFARE THEY FORM A PART OF THE RESERVES
EACH FACE WAS THE PICTURE OF AWE AND FEAR BUT FOR WHAT REASON I DID NOT KNOW NOR DID I LEARN UNTIL TEN YEARS LATER THAT THERE WERE STILL OTHER BRAVES BEHIND THOSE WHO REGARDED ME WAS APPARENT FROM THE FACT THAT THE LEADERS PASSED BACK WHISPERED WORD TO THOSE BEHIND THEM
AND THERE CAME AGAIN FROM THE BLACK SHADOWS THE SOUND OF A MOVING THING AND A FAINT RUSTLING AS OF DEAD LEAVES THE SHOCK TO MY ALREADY OVERSTRAINED NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE IN THE EXTREME AND WITH A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT I STROVE TO BREAK MY AWFUL BONDS
UPON THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE STEERING GEAR AND PROPELLERS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST VOLLEY THE GREAT FLEET SWUNG TRAILING OFF IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT HAD FIRST APPEARED SEVERAL OF THE CRAFT WERE LIMPING PERCEPTIBLY
AS THE CRAFT NEARED THE BUILDING AND JUST BEFORE SHE STRUCK THE MARTIAN WARRIORS SWARMED UPON HER FROM THE WINDOWS AND WITH THEIR GREAT SPEARS EASED THE SHOCK OF THE COLLISION
AND FROM MY BALCONY I COULD SEE THAT IT WALKED ERECT UPON TWO LEGS AND SURMISED THAT IT WAS SOME NEW AND STRANGE MARTIAN MONSTROSITY WITH WHICH I HAD NOT AS YET BECOME ACQUAINTED THEY REMOVED THEIR PRISONER TO THE GROUND
A SENSE OF DELICIOUS DREAMINESS OVERCAME ME MY MUSCLES RELAXED AND I WAS ON THE POINT OF GIVING WAY TO MY DESIRE TO SLEEP WHEN THE SOUND OF APPROACHING HORSES REACHED MY EARS
I REASONED WITH MYSELF THAT I HAD LAIN HELPLESS FOR MANY HOURS WITHIN THE CAVE
IN THE DARKNESS OF THE CAVE AND TO MY DISTORTED IMAGINATION TO BE CREEPING STEALTHILY UPON ME UNABLE LONGER TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO ESCAPE THIS HORRIBLE PLACE I LEAPED QUICKLY THROUGH THE OPENING INTO THE STARLIGHT OF A CLEAR ARIZONA NIGHT
BUT WHERE TO GO AND HOW WAS AS MUCH OF A PUZZLE TO ME AS THE AGE OLD SEARCH FOR THE SPRING OF ETERNAL LIFE HAS BEEN TO EARTHLY MEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME I DECIDED THAT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY I WOULD TAKE SOLA INTO MY CONFIDENCE AND OPENLY ASK HER TO AID ME
NOT A SIGN OF LIFE WAS MANIFEST UPON HER AS SHE DRIFTED SLOWLY WITH THE LIGHT BREEZE IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION SHE WAS DRIFTING SOME FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
DRIFTING UNGUIDED AND UNMANNED THROUGH THE LONELY WASTES OF THE MARTIAN HEAVENS A DERELICT OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TYPIFYING THE LIFE STORY OF THESE STRANGE AND FEROCIOUS CREATURES INTO WHOSE UNFRIENDLY HANDS FATE HAD CARRIED IT
THE NOISE OF THE APPROACHING HORSES HAD CEASED AND I JUDGED THE INDIANS WERE CREEPING STEALTHILY UPON ME ALONG THE LITTLE LEDGE WHICH LED TO MY LIVING TOMB I REMEMBER THAT I HOPED THEY WOULD MAKE SHORT WORK OF ME
WROUGHT BY THE MOONLIGHT INTO A MIRACLE OF SOFT SPLENDOR AND WONDROUS ENCHANTMENT FEW WESTERN WONDERS ARE MORE INSPIRING THAN THE BEAUTIES OF AN ARIZONA MOONLIT LANDSCAPE THE SILVERED MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
AND A QUANTITY OF SOLID FOODS AND LIQUIDS INCLUDING MANY CASKS OF WATER THE FIRST I HAD SEEN SINCE MY ADVENT UPON MARS
THE CRISP FRESH MOUNTAIN AIR OUTSIDE THE CAVE ACTED AS AN IMMEDIATE TONIC AND I FELT NEW LIFE AND NEW COURAGE COURSING THROUGH ME PAUSING UPON THE BRINK OF THE LEDGE I UPBRAIDED MYSELF FOR WHAT NOW SEEMED TO ME WHOLLY UNWARRANTED APPREHENSION
I WAS NOT YET PROFICIENT WITH ALL THE WEAPONS BUT MY GREAT FAMILIARITY WITH SIMILAR EARTHLY WEAPONS MADE ME AN UNUSUALLY APT PUPIL AND I PROGRESSED IN A VERY SATISFACTORY MANNER THE TRAINING OF MYSELF AND THE YOUNG MARTIANS WAS CONDUCTED SOLELY BY THE WOMEN
AS I GAZED AT IT ON THAT FAR GONE NIGHT IT SEEMED TO CALL ACROSS THE UNTHINKABLE VOID TO LURE ME TO IT TO DRAW ME AS THE LODESTONE ATTRACTS A PARTICLE OF IRON MY LONGING WAS BEYOND THE POWER OF OPPOSITION
THEY MAKE THE LAWS AS THEY ARE NEEDED A NEW LAW FOR EACH EMERGENCY THEY ARE UNFETTERED BY PRECEDENT IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE CUSTOMS HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN BY AGES OF REPETITION
AND A MIGHTY HOPE SURGED THROUGH ME THAT THE FLEET WOULD RETURN AND DEMAND A RECKONING FROM THE GREEN WARRIORS WHO HAD SO RUTHLESSLY AND WANTONLY ATTACKED IT CLOSE AT MY HEEL IN HIS NOW ACCUSTOMED PLACE FOLLOWED WOOLA THE HOUND
ENOUGH ONLY TO SUFFICE FOR MY DAILY NEEDS AS I REACHED THE DOORWAY OF OUR BUILDING A STRANGE SURPRISE AWAITED ME A WARRIOR APPROACHED BEARING THE ARMS ORNAMENTS AND FULL ACCOUTERMENTS OF HIS KIND THESE HE PRESENTED TO ME WITH A FEW UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS
