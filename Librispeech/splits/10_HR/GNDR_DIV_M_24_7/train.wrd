THERE IS NOT A GOOD FILM IN THE WORLD BUT IS THE BETTER FOR BEING SEEN IN IMMEDIATE SUCCESSION TO ITSELF SIX REEL PROGRAMMES ARE A WEARINESS TO THE FLESH THE BEST OF THE OLD ONE REEL BIOGRAPHS OF GRIFFITH
THESE FRIENDS GIVE THE SENSE OF PATRIOTISM IN MASS THEN AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FEELING AS THE SPECIAL AGENTS TO EXPRESS IT THE SOLDIERS ARE IN BATTLE BY THE FORTUNES OF WAR
RAGGED GLOWERING STRIKERS AND GOSSIPING DICKERING PEOPLE IN THE MARKETPLACE ONLY GRIFFITH AND HIS CLOSE DISCIPLES CAN DO THESE AS WELL AS ALMOST ANY MANAGER CAN REPRODUCE THE OCEAN
WITH NEITHER HOUSE NOR CLOATHS TO COVER THEM
CANNOT STIR ABROAD WITHOUT A CHAIR
AND THE MOST INEVITABLE PROSPECT OF INTAILING THE LIKE OR GREATER MISERIES UPON THEIR BREED FOR EVER I PROFESS IN THE SINCERITY OF MY HEART
ONLY THE GIRL KNOWS HE WAS FIRST A FAILURE THE WOUNDED GENERAL HONORS HIM AS THE HERO ABOVE ALL NOW SHE IS RADIANT SHE CANNOT HELP BUT BE TRIUMPHANT
IT WOULD GREATLY LESSEN THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS WITH WHOM WE ARE YEARLY OVER RUN BEING THE PRINCIPAL BREEDERS OF THE NATION AS WELL AS OUR MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES AND WHO
CHAPTER FIVE THE PICTURE OF CROWD SPLENDOR
IMPERSONATED BY LILLIAN GISH IS RESCUED BY THE KU KLUX KLAN FROM THE MULATTO POLITICIAN SILAS LYNCH IMPERSONATED BY GEORGE SEIGMANN THE LADY IS BROUGHT FORWARD AS A TYPICAL HELPLESS WHITE MAIDEN
IN THE GLASS LATER
ARE ESSENTIALLY PRIVATE PERSONS INDIVIDUALS IN EXTREMIS IF YOU GO TO A MOTION PICTURE AND FEEL YOURSELF SUDDENLY GRIPPED BY THE HIGHEST DRAMATIC TENSION AS ON THE OLD STAGE AND REFLECT AFTERWARD THAT IT WAS A FIGHT BETWEEN ONLY
IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN THE LIBRARIES OF THE UNIVERSITIES AS A STANDARD ONE REEL FILMS ARE UNFORTUNATE IN THIS SENSE THAT IN ORDER TO SEE A FAVORITE THE STUDENT MUST WAIT
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO MARRIAGE WHICH ALL WISE NATIONS HAVE EITHER ENCOURAGED BY REWARDS OR ENFORCED BY LAWS AND PENALTIES IT WOULD ENCREASE THE CARE AND TENDERNESS OF MOTHERS TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN
IMPRACTICABLE ON THE STAGE PARADISE LOST WOULD MAKE A FAR BETTER FILM THAN IBSEN'S JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN THOUGH BORKMAN IS A DRAMATIC MASTERPIECE AND MILTON COULD NOT WRITE AN EFFECTIVE PLAY
NOURISHING AND WHOLESOME FOOD WHETHER STEWED ROASTED BAKED OR BOILED AND I MAKE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL EQUALLY SERVE IN A FRICASIE OR A RAGOUST
MISTER LEE IS FAR FROM INFALLIBLE IN HIS REMEDIES FOR FACTORY AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BUT IN SENSITIVENESS TO THE FLOWING STREET OF HUMANITY HE IS INDEED A MAN
AND THEREBY HAVE AVOIDED SUCH A PERPETUAL SCENE OF MISFORTUNES AS THEY HAVE SINCE GONE THROUGH BY THE OPPRESSION OF LANDLORDS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF PAYING RENT WITHOUT MONEY OR TRADE THE WANT OF COMMON SUSTENANCE
GLIMPSES OF THE BATTLE ARE GIVEN WITH A SPLENDOR THAT ONLY GRIFFITH HAS ATTAINED BLANCHE SWEET
TILL THE CRISIS HAS PASSED THE WRATH OF THE SOUTHERNER AGAINST THE BLACKS AND THEIR NORTHERN ORGANIZERS HAS BEEN PILED UP THROUGH MANY PREVIOUS SCENES
FOR THE CARCASS OF A GOOD FAT CHILD WHICH AS I HAVE SAID WILL MAKE FOUR DISHES OF EXCELLENT NUTRITIVE MEAT WHEN HE HATH ONLY SOME PARTICULAR FRIEND OR HIS OWN FAMILY TO DINE WITH HIM THUS THE SQUIRE WILL LEARN TO BE A GOOD LANDLORD
ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS IN REGARD TO THE PHOTOPLAY HERE ARE TWO BITS FROM HIS DISCOURSE STRIKE THE DIALOGUE FROM MOLIERE'S TARTUFFE AND WHAT AUDIENCE WOULD BEAR ITS MERE STAGE BUSINESS
AND IN GONDOLAS IT GIVES OUT THE ATMOSPHERE OF TOWN CROWD HAPPINESS
THE ORIGINAL BOOK BY THOMAS DIXON IT IS BAD WHEREVER IT IS UNADULTERATED GRIFFITH WHICH IS HALF THE TIME IT IS GOOD THE REVEREND THOMAS DIXON IS A RATHER STAGY SIMON LEGREE IN HIS AVOWED VIEWS A
TO BRING US THESE PANORAMIC DRAMA ELEMENTS BY THE LAW OF COMPENSATION WHILE THE MOTION PICTURE IS SHALLOW IN SHOWING PRIVATE PASSION IT IS POWERFUL IN CONVEYING THE PASSIONS OF MASSES OF MEN BERNARD SHAW
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A BEVY OF VILLAGE LOVERS IS CONVEYED IN A LIVELY SWEET HEARTING DANCE THEN THE BOY AND HIS COMRADES GO FORTH TO WAR THE LINES PASS BETWEEN HAND WAVING CROWDS OF FRIENDS
WHICH OF THEM COULD BRING THE FATTEST CHILD TO THE MARKET MEN WOULD BECOME AS FOND OF THEIR WIVES DURING THE TIME OF THEIR PREGNANCY AS THEY ARE NOW OF THEIR MARES IN FOAL THEIR COWS IN CALF
FULL IN OUR OWN POWER AND WHEREBY WE CAN INCUR NO DANGER
AS TO OUR CITY OF DUBLIN SHAMBLES MAY BE APPOINTED FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THE MOST CONVENIENT PARTS OF IT AND BUTCHERS WE MAY BE ASSURED WILL NOT BE WANTING ALTHOUGH I RATHER RECOMMEND
THAT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST PERSONAL INTEREST IN ENDEAVOURING TO PROMOTE THIS NECESSARY WORK HAVING NO OTHER MOTIVE THAN THE PUBLICK GOOD OF MY COUNTRY BY ADVANCING OUR TRADE PROVIDING FOR INFANTS RELIEVING THE POOR
AND CLARA WILLIAMS AS THE ITALIAN AND HIS SWEETHEART THEY OWE THE FORCE OF THEIR ACTING TO THE FACT THAT THEY EXPRESS EACH MASS OF HUMANITY IN TURN THEIR CHILD IS BORN IT DOES NOT FLOURISH
HYDROPHOBIA IN THE LATTER END OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN UNCONSCIOUSLY MISTER DIXON HAS DONE HIS BEST TO PROVE THAT LEGREE WAS NOT A FICTITIOUS CHARACTER
IT IS OF A MUCH GREATER EXTENT
THE MEASURE AND THE GOODNESS NOR COULD EVER YET BE BROUGHT TO MAKE ONE FAIR PROPOSAL OF JUST DEALING THOUGH OFTEN AND EARNESTLY INVITED TO IT THEREFORE I REPEAT
FOR THIS KIND OF COMMODITY WILL NOT BEAR EXPORTATION AND FLESH BEING OF TOO TENDER A CONSISTENCE TO ADMIT A LONG CONTINUANCE IN SALT
BUT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY MY FRIEND HE CONFESSED THAT THIS EXPEDIENT WAS PUT INTO HIS HEAD BY THE FAMOUS SALMANAAZOR A NATIVE OF THE ISLAND FORMOSA
AN OLD GRIFFITH BIOGRAPH FIRST ISSUED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN BEFORE GRIFFITH'S NAME OR THAT OF ANY ACTOR IN FILMS WAS ADVERTISED BLANCHE SWEET IS THE LEADING LADY AND CHARLES H WEST THE LEADING MAN
STAY AT HOME ON PURPOSE WITH A DESIGN TO DELIVER THE KINGDOM TO THE PRETENDER HOPING TO TAKE THEIR ADVANTAGE BY THE ABSENCE OF SO MANY GOOD PROTESTANTS WHO HAVE CHOSEN RATHER TO LEAVE THEIR COUNTRY THAN STAY AT HOME AND PAY TITHES
SOMETHING THE PHOTOPLAYS THAT TRACE STRICTLY PERSONAL HATREDS CANNOT ACHIEVE THE BIRTH OF A NATION IS A CROWD PICTURE IN A TRIPLE SENSE ON THE FILMS AS IN THE AUDIENCE
THE BATTLE IN THE END IS GREATER BECAUSE OF ITS SELF POSSESSION AND CONCENTRATION ALL PACKED INTO TWENTY MINUTES WHEN IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION LINCOLN
WOULD FALL FLAT IN MOTION PICTURES THE MINOR SITUATIONS OF DRAMATIC INTENSITY MIGHT IN MANY CASES BE BUILT UP THE CRISIS WOULD INEVITABLY FAIL IAGO AND OTHELLO AND LEAR
TELLING GOOD BY TO THEIR KINDRED ON THE PIERS THEN THE DRAMA OF ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK THE WONDER OF THE STEERAGE PEOPLE POURING DOWN THEIR PROPER GANGWAY IS CONTRASTED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL
OF TWENTY MINUTES EACH THESE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THAT IF THEY PLEASE AT ALL ONE CAN SEE THEM AGAIN AT ONCE WITHOUT
THOUGH THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE IS BLOWN OUT BY A SHELL AND THE DYING ARE EVERYWHERE THIS ONE REEL WORK OF ART HAS BEEN REISSUED OF LATE BY THE BIOGRAPH COMPANY
THAT THEY WILL FIRST ASK THE PARENTS OF THESE MORTALS WHETHER THEY WOULD NOT AT THIS DAY THINK IT A GREAT HAPPINESS TO HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR FOOD AT A YEAR OLD IN THE MANNER I PRESCRIBE
BUT IT IS GRIFFITH'S GREAT FILM THE BATTLE
WHO PROTESTED TO ME THAT HE NEVER KNEW ABOVE ONE OR TWO INSTANCES UNDER THE AGE OF SIX EVEN IN A PART OF THE KINGDOM SO RENOWNED FOR THE QUICKEST PROFICIENCY IN THAT ART
IT TURNS THE CROWD INTO A MOB THAT IS EITHER FOR OR AGAINST THE REVEREND THOMAS DIXON'S POISONOUS HATRED OF THE NEGRO GRIFFITH IS A CHAMELEON IN INTERPRETING HIS AUTHORS WHEREVER THE SCENARIO SHOWS TRACES OF THE CLANSMAN
NOR OFFER TO BEAT OR KICK THEM AS IS TOO FREQUENT A PRACTICE FOR FEAR OF A MISCARRIAGE MANY OTHER ADVANTAGES MIGHT BE ENUMERATED FOR INSTANCE
AND THE WHOLE BODY SOCIAL OF THE VILLAGE HOW THE COSTUMES FLASH AND THE HANDKERCHIEFS WAVE AROUND HER
OF BEING A LITTLE CAUTIOUS NOT TO SELL OUR COUNTRY AND CONSCIENCES FOR NOTHING
THE PROPAGATION OF SWINE'S FLESH AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE ART OF MAKING GOOD BACON SO MUCH WANTED AMONG US BY THE GREAT DESTRUCTION OF PIGS TOO FREQUENT AT OUR TABLES
WHO ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN CHILDREN ALTHOUGH I APPREHEND THERE CANNOT BE SO MANY UNDER THE PRESENT DISTRESSES OF THE KINGDOM BUT THIS BEING GRANTED THERE WILL REMAIN
AT A CERTAIN AGE WHO ARE BORN OF PARENTS IN EFFECT AS LITTLE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM AS THOSE WHO DEMAND OUR CHARITY IN THE STREETS AS TO MY OWN PART HAVING TURNED MY THOUGHTS FOR MANY YEARS UPON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT
THAT IT WILL PREVENT THOSE VOLUNTARY ABORTIONS AND THAT HORRID PRACTICE OF WOMEN MURDERING THEIR BASTARD CHILDREN ALAS TOO FREQUENT AMONG US
FOR WE CAN NEITHER EMPLOY THEM IN HANDICRAFT OR AGRICULTURE WE NEITHER BUILD HOUSES I MEAN IN THE COUNTRY NOR CULTIVATE LAND THEY CAN VERY SELDOM PICK UP A LIVELIHOOD BY STEALING TILL THEY ARRIVE AT SIX YEARS OLD
I GRANT THIS FOOD WILL BE SOMEWHAT DEAR AND THEREFORE VERY PROPER FOR LANDLORDS WHO AS THEY HAVE ALREADY DEVOURED MOST OF THE PARENTS SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST TITLE TO THE CHILDREN INFANT'S FLESH WILL BE IN SEASON THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR PREVENTING THE CHILDREN OF POOR PEOPLE IN IRELAND
SACRIFICING THE POOR INNOCENT BABES I DOUBT MORE TO AVOID THE EXPENCE THAN THE SHAME WHICH WOULD MOVE TEARS AND PITY IN THE MOST SAVAGE AND INHUMAN BREAST
EXCEPT WHERE THEY ARE OF TOWARDLY PARTS ALTHOUGH I CONFESS THEY LEARN THE RUDIMENTS MUCH EARLIER DURING WHICH TIME THEY CAN HOWEVER BE PROPERLY LOOKED UPON ONLY AS PROBATIONERS
SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE IT IS A MELANCHOLY OBJECT TO THOSE WHO WALK THROUGH THIS GREAT TOWN OR TRAVEL IN THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY SEE THE STREETS THE ROADS AND CABBIN DOORS
AND WHEN HE WILL GO TO THE PICTURE SHOW TO VERIFY IT THE SHODDIEST SILENT DRAMA MAY CONTAIN NOBLE VIEWS OF THE SEA THIS PART IS ALMOST SURE TO BE GOOD IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL RESOURCE
I HAVE RECKONED UPON A MEDIUM THAT A CHILD JUST BORN WILL WEIGH TWELVE POUNDS AND IN A SOLAR YEAR IF TOLERABLY NURSED ENCREASETH TO TWENTY EIGHT POUNDS
AND TO FATTEN THEM WOULD NOT ANSWER THE CHARGE
AND THE REST OF THE KINGDOM WHERE PROBABLY THEY WILL BE SOLD SOMEWHAT CHEAPER THE REMAINING EIGHTY THOUSAND
DRAB EAST SIDE THE GONDOLIER BECOMES BOOT BLACK THE GRAPE GATHERING PEASANT GIRL BECOMES THE SUFFERING SLUM MOTHER THEY ARE NOT SPECIALIZED CHARACTERS LIKE PENDENNIS OR BECKY SHARP IN THE NOVELS OF THACKERAY
LISTEN TO THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE DIVISIONS OF HIS BOOK CROWDS AND MACHINES LETTING THE CROWDS BE GOOD LETTING THE CROWDS BE BEAUTIFUL CROWDS AND HEROES
THEY HAVE NOT STRENGTH TO PERFORM IT AND THUS THE COUNTRY AND THEMSELVES ARE HAPPILY DELIVERED FROM THE EVILS TO COME I HAVE TOO LONG DIGRESSED AND THEREFORE SHALL RETURN TO MY SUBJECT
BUT THIS AND MANY OTHERS I OMIT BEING STUDIOUS OF BREVITY SUPPOSING THAT ONE THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THIS CITY WOULD BE CONSTANT CUSTOMERS FOR INFANTS FLESH BESIDES
AGAINST THEIR CONSCIENCE TO AN EPISCOPAL CURATE SECONDLY THE POORER TENANTS WILL HAVE SOMETHING VALUABLE OF THEIR OWN WHICH BY LAW
BLACK CATTLE OR SWINE AND MY REASON IS THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE SELDOM THE FRUITS OF MARRIAGE A CIRCUMSTANCE NOT MUCH REGARDED BY OUR SAVAGES THEREFORE ONE MALE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SERVE FOUR FEMALES
LASTLY OF PUTTING A SPIRIT OF HONESTY INDUSTRY AND SKILL INTO OUR SHOP KEEPERS WHO
IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION WHICH COULD BETTER BE CALLED THE OVERTHROW OF NEGRO RULE THE KU KLUX KLAN DASHES DOWN THE ROAD AS POWERFULLY AS NIAGARA POURS OVER THE CLIFF FINALLY THE WHITE GIRL ELSIE STONEMAN
THIS FOOD WOULD LIKEWISE BRING GREAT CUSTOM TO TAVERNS WHERE THE VINTNERS WILL CERTAINLY BE SO PRUDENT AS TO PROCURE THE BEST RECEIPTS FOR DRESSING IT TO PERFECTION AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE THEIR HOUSES FREQUENTED BY ALL THE FINE GENTLEMEN
ONE KIND OF A CROWD PICTURE
MOB MOVEMENTS OF ANGER AND JOY WILL GO THROUGH FANATICAL AND PROVINCIAL WHIRLWINDS INTO GREAT NATIONAL MOVEMENTS OF ANGER AND JOY A BOOK BY GERALD STANLEY LEE THAT HAS A SCORE OF FUTURE SCENARIOS IN IT A BOOK THAT MIGHT
FORMERLY DISABLED BY INCIDENTAL DEFICIENCIES OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER THAT DO NOT MATTER IN THE PICTURE THEATRE
A TRUE LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY AND WHOSE VIRTUES I HIGHLY ESTEEM WAS LATELY PLEASED IN DISCOURSING ON THIS MATTER TO OFFER A REFINEMENT UPON MY SCHEME HE SAID THAT MANY GENTLEMEN OF THIS KINGDOM
IT REPRESENTS IN AN ACUTER WAY ANOTHER PHASE OF THE SAME CHILD STRUGGLE WITH THE HEAT THAT THE GAMINS INDICATE IN THEIR PURSUIT OF THE WATER CART THEN A DEEPER MATTER
YET THE SEA OF HUMANITY IS DRAMATICALLY BLOOD BROTHER TO THE PACIFIC ATLANTIC OR MEDITERRANEAN
WHERE ARE WE GOING THE CROWD SCARE THE STRIKE AN INVENTION FOR MAKING CROWDS THINK THE CROWD'S IMAGINATION ABOUT PEOPLE SPEAKING AS ONE OF THE CROWD
AND FOR NO OTHER THAT EVER WAS IS OR I THINK EVER CAN BE UPON EARTH THEREFORE LET NO MAN TALK TO ME OF OTHER EXPEDIENTS
THAT HAD BEEN PURSUING EACH OTHER EARLIER IN THE FILM OTHERWISE THE CONFLICT HOWEVER VIOLENT APPEALED MAINLY TO THE SENSE OF SPEED SO
IN SUCH A MANNER AS INSTEAD OF BEING A CHARGE UPON THEIR PARENTS OR THE PARISH
THROUGH FIVE OTHER REELS OF A MIXED PROGRAMME THAT USUALLY IS BAD THAT IS THE REASON ONE REEL MASTERPIECES SELDOM APPEAR NOW THE PRODUCER IN A MOOD TO MAKE A SPECIAL EFFORT
BESIDES THE PROFIT OF A NEW DISH INTRODUCED TO THE TABLES OF ALL GENTLEMEN OF FORTUNE IN THE KINGDOM WHO HAVE ANY REFINEMENT IN TASTE AND THE MONEY WILL CIRCULATE AMONG OUR SELVES THE GOODS BEING ENTIRELY OF OUR OWN GROWTH AND MANUFACTURE
ARCHITECTURE IN MOTION AND THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER
BUYING THE CHILDREN ALIVE AND DRESSING THEM HOT FROM THE KNIFE AS WE DO ROASTING PIGS A VERY WORTHY PERSON
A MERRY GRAPE HARVEST THEN THE
WHICH ROASTED WHOLE WILL MAKE A CONSIDERABLE FIGURE AT A LORD MAYOR'S FEAST
FOR AS TO THE MALES MY AMERICAN ACQUAINTANCE ASSURED ME FROM FREQUENT EXPERIENCE THAT THEIR FLESH WAS GENERALLY TOUGH AND LEAN LIKE THAT OF OUR SCHOOL BOYS BY CONTINUAL EXERCISE AND THEIR TASTE DISAGREEABLE
TO BE ABOUT TWO SHILLINGS PER ANNUM RAGS INCLUDED
A VERY GREAT ADDITIONAL GRIEVANCE AND THEREFORE WHOEVER COULD FIND OUT A FAIR CHEAP AND EASY METHOD OF MAKING THESE CHILDREN
NOT EXCEEDING FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOR UNDER TWELVE SO GREAT A NUMBER OF BOTH SEXES IN EVERY COUNTRY BEING NOW READY TO STARVE FOR WANT OF WORK AND SERVICE AND THESE TO BE DISPOSED OF BY THEIR PARENTS IF ALIVE
I SHALL REITERATE THROUGHOUT THIS WORK THE NECESSITY FOR RESTRAINT A ONE HOUR PROGRAMME IS LONG ENOUGH FOR ANY ONE IF THE OBSERVER IS PLEASED HE WILL SIT IT THROUGH AGAIN AND TAKE ANOTHER HOUR
THEIR CORN AND CATTLE BEING ALREADY SEIZED AND MONEY A THING UNKNOWN THIRDLY WHEREAS THE MAINTAINANCE OF AN HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM TWO YEARS OLD AND UPWARDS CANNOT BE COMPUTED AT LESS THAN TEN SHILLINGS A PIECE PER ANNUM
WHO CAME FROM THENCE TO LONDON ABOVE TWENTY YEARS AGO AND IN CONVERSATION TOLD MY FRIEND THAT IN HIS COUNTRY WHEN ANY YOUNG PERSON HAPPENED TO BE PUT TO DEATH THE EXECUTIONER SOLD THE CARCASS TO PERSONS OF QUALITY AS A PRIME DAINTY
WHO CAN WRITE NOVELS AND EPICS BUT CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM WRITE PLAYS WELL THE FILM LENDS ITSELF ADMIRABLY TO THE SUCCESSION OF EVENTS PROPER TO NARRATIVE AND EPIC BUT PHYSICALLY
NOTE IN ESPECIAL WHAT SHAW SAYS ABOUT NARRATIVE EPIC AND PARADISE LOST HE HAS IN MIND NO DOUBT THE POURING HOSTS OF DEMONS AND ANGELS THIS IS
OTHERS WHO MIGHT HAVE IT AT MERRY MEETINGS PARTICULARLY AT WEDDINGS AND CHRISTENINGS I COMPUTE THAT DUBLIN WOULD TAKE OFF ANNUALLY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND CARCASSES
FOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND USELESS MOUTHS AND BACKS AND SECONDLY THERE BEING A ROUND MILLION OF CREATURES IN HUMANE FIGURE THROUGHOUT THIS KINGDOM
LET NO MAN TALK TO ME OF THESE AND THE LIKE EXPEDIENTS TILL HE HATH AT LEAST SOME GLYMPSE OF HOPE THAT THERE WILL EVER BE SOME HEARTY AND SINCERE ATTEMPT TO PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE BUT
AND FOR THE TIME BREAKS HER HEART HE GOES FORTH A FUGITIVE NOT ONLY FROM BATTLE BUT FROM HER TERRIBLE GIRLISH ANGER BUT LATER HE RALLIES HE
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS I COULD NAME A COUNTRY WHICH WOULD BE GLAD TO EAT UP OUR WHOLE NATION WITHOUT IT AFTER ALL I AM NOT SO VIOLENTLY BENT UPON MY OWN OPINION AS TO REJECT ANY OFFER PROPOSED BY WISE MEN
BRINGS A TRAIN OF POWDER WAGONS THROUGH FIRES BUILT IN HIS PATH BY THE ENEMY'S SCOUTS HE LOSES EVERY ONE OF HIS MEN AND ALL BUT THE LAST WAGON WHICH HE DRIVES HIMSELF HIS RETURN WITH THAT AMMUNITION SAVES THE HARD FOUGHT DAY
GOES DOWN BEFORE THE ASSASSIN IT IS A MASTER SCENE HE FALLS AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND A THOUSAND HIGH AND NOBLE CROWD ASPIRATIONS THE MIMIC AUDIENCE IN THE RESTORED FORD'S THEATRE RISES IN PANIC
WILL BECOME SACRED IN EACH OTHER'S EYES IN PICTURES AND IN FACT A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS THEME ON OTHER PLANES
THE ONSET IS UNEXPECTEDLY NEAR TO THE HOUSE WHERE ONCE WAS THE DANCE THE BOY IS AT FIRST A COWARD HE ENTERS THE OLD FAMILIAR DOOR HE APPEALS TO THE GIRL TO HIDE HIM
THEY SHALL ON THE CONTRARY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FEEDING AND PARTLY TO THE CLOATHING OF MANY THOUSANDS THERE IS LIKEWISE ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IN MY SCHEME
WHAT BECOMES OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHAKESPEARE AND SHERIDAN KNOWLES IN THE FILM OR BETWEEN SHAKESPEARE'S LEAR AND ANY ONE ELSE'S LEAR NO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL THE INTEREST LIES IN THE NEW OPENING
WHICH SHALL BE FOUND EQUALLY INNOCENT CHEAP EASY AND EFFECTUAL BUT BEFORE SOMETHING OF THAT KIND SHALL BE ADVANCED IN CONTRADICTION TO MY SCHEME AND OFFERING A BETTER I DESIRE THE AUTHOR OR AUTHORS
IMPERSONATES THE ITALIAN IN A FILM OF THAT TITLE BY THOMAS H INCE AND G GARDENER SULLIVAN THE FIRST PART TAKEN OSTENSIBLY IN VENICE DELINEATES THE FESTIVAL SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGES
MOBS SPLENDIDLY HANDLED TOSSING WILDLY AND RHYTHMICALLY LIKE THE SEA THEN IS DELINEATED THE RISE OF THE KU KLUX KLAN
WILL BE PLEASED MATURELY TO CONSIDER TWO POINTS FIRST AS THINGS NOW STAND HOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO FIND FOOD
THE NUMBER OF SOULS IN THIS KINGDOM BEING USUALLY RECKONED ONE MILLION AND A HALF OF THESE I CALCULATE THERE MAY BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND COUPLE WHOSE WIVES ARE BREEDERS
AS TO MY SELF HAVING BEEN WEARIED OUT FOR MANY YEARS WITH OFFERING VAIN IDLE VISIONARY THOUGHTS AND AT LENGTH UTTERLY DESPAIRING OF SUCCESS I FORTUNATELY FELL UPON THIS PROPOSAL WHICH AS IT IS WHOLLY NEW
THIS CROWD IS INTERPRETED IN ESPECIAL FOR US
I HAVE ALREADY COMPUTED THE CHARGE OF NURSING A BEGGAR'S CHILD
THEY CANNOT GET WORK AND CONSEQUENTLY PINE AWAY FROM WANT OF NOURISHMENT
BECAUSE IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN THAT THEY ARE EVERY DAY DYING AND ROTTING BY COLD AND FAMINE AND FILTH AND VERMIN
THE QUESTION THEREFORE IS HOW THIS NUMBER SHALL BE REARED AND PROVIDED FOR WHICH AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID UNDER THE PRESENT SITUATION OF AFFAIRS IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE BY ALL THE METHODS HITHERTO PROPOSED
ADDING THOSE WHO ARE BEGGARS BY PROFESSION TO THE BULK OF FARMERS COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN WHO ARE BEGGARS IN EFFECT I DESIRE THOSE POLITICIANS WHO DISLIKE MY OVERTURE
I HAVE BEEN ASSURED BY A VERY KNOWING AMERICAN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE IN LONDON THAT A YOUNG HEALTHY CHILD WELL NURSED IS AT A YEAR OLD A MOST DELICIOUS
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THEM GROSSLY MISTAKEN IN THEIR COMPUTATION IT IS TRUE A CHILD JUST DROPT FROM ITS DAM MAY BE SUPPORTED BY HER MILK FOR A SOLAR YEAR WITH LITTLE OTHER NOURISHMENT
SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
AND IN THE SUBURBS IN SOUTHWARK AND IN THE EAST PART SUCH AS WAPPING RATCLIFF STEPNEY ROTHERHITHE AND THE LIKE THE PEOPLE GENERALLY STAYED EXCEPT HERE AND THERE A FEW WEALTHY FAMILIES WHO AS ABOVE
A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
ALL THE RUINED FAMILIES OF THE ROYAL PARTY FLOCKED HITHER ALL THE OLD SOLDIERS SET UP TRADES HERE AND ABUNDANCE OF FAMILIES SETTLED HERE AGAIN
OR RATHER AT THE UPPER END OF DRURY LANE
AND IT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ESPECIALLY AND IN CLARKENWELL SO THAT BY THE SECOND WEEK IN AUGUST CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ALONE BURIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND CLARKENWELL
FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
I SAY AS MANY DID BECAUSE SEVERAL DID SO AT LAST ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ARMIES IN THE WAR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MANY YEARS PAST AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT SPEAKING OF SECOND CAUSES
OF ALL DISTEMPERS WHEREOF IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DIED OF THE PLAGUE YET THERE WAS BUT TWENTY EIGHT IN THE WHOLE CITY WITHIN THE WALLS AND BUT NINETEEN IN SOUTHWARK
MAGISTRATES AND SERVANTS LEFT IN THE CITY AS THEY FLED NOW OUT OF THE CITY SO I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT THE COURT REMOVED EARLY
AND IT WAS MEET HE SHOULD DO WITH ME AS SHOULD SEEM GOOD TO HIM WITH THIS RESOLUTION I WENT TO BED
AS I WAS THAT I OUGHT INDEED TO SUBMIT TO IT AS A WORK OF HEAVEN IF I HAD BEEN ANY WAY DISABLED BY DISTEMPERS OR DISEASES AND THAT THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO GO
SWEATED A LITTLE AND WAS MUCH REFRESHED THE APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING THE INFECTION WENT ALSO QUITE AWAY WITH MY ILLNESS AND I WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS AS USUAL
HAD MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT TRAVELLED DONE SO THE PLAGUE HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED INTO SO MANY COUNTRY TOWNS AND HOUSES AS IT WAS TO THE GREAT DAMAGE AND INDEED TO THE RUIN OF ABUNDANCE OF PEOPLE
FLYING FROM GOD AND THAT HE COULD CAUSE HIS JUSTICE TO OVERTAKE ME WHEN AND WHERE HE THOUGHT FIT THESE THOUGHTS QUITE TURNED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN AND WHEN I CAME TO DISCOURSE WITH MY BROTHER AGAIN
MANUFACTURERS AND THE LIKE
AND IN OTHER PLACES WHERE HE HAD BEEN FOR MY BROTHER BEING A MERCHANT WAS A FEW YEARS BEFORE AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED RETURNED FROM ABROAD COMING LAST FROM LISBON AND HOW
THAT IF I HAD BEEN A STRANGER AND AT A LOSS FOR MY WAY I MIGHT SOMETIMES HAVE GONE THE LENGTH OF A WHOLE STREET I MEAN OF THE BY STREETS AND SEEN NOBODY TO DIRECT ME
BUT WE PERCEIVED THE INFECTION KEPT CHIEFLY IN THE OUT PARISHES WHICH BEING VERY POPULOUS AND FULLER ALSO OF POOR THE DISTEMPER FOUND MORE TO PREY UPON THAN IN THE CITY
AND AS ALL TOGETHER REGARD THE QUESTION BEFORE HIM AND THEN I THINK HE MAY SAFELY TAKE THEM FOR INTIMATIONS FROM HEAVEN OF WHAT IS HIS UNQUESTIONED DUTY TO DO IN SUCH A CASE I MEAN
AND HARDLY ANYTHING OF REFORMATION THOUGH THEY DID NOT WANT BEING TOLD THAT THEIR CRYING VICES MIGHT WITHOUT BREACH OF CHARITY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE FAR IN BRINGING THAT TERRIBLE JUDGEMENT UPON THE WHOLE NATION
IRRESOLUTE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I HAD SET THE EVENING WHOLLY APART TO CONSIDER SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT AND WAS ALL ALONE FOR ALREADY PEOPLE HAD AS IT WERE BY A GENERAL CONSENT
AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
THERE DIED BUT THREE OF WHICH NOT ONE WITHIN THE WHOLE CITY OR LIBERTIES AND SAINT ANDREW'S BURIED BUT FIFTEEN WHICH WAS VERY LOW
THAT WOULD SURROUND ME AND THAT IF I ATTEMPTED TO SECURE MYSELF BY FLEEING FROM MY HABITATION AND ACTED CONTRARY TO THESE INTIMATIONS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE DIVINE IT WAS A KIND OF
SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
SO THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM EXTRAORDINARY AND I OUGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT DID NOT EVIDENTLY POINT OUT OR INTIMATE TO ME THAT IT WAS THE WILL OF HEAVEN I SHOULD NOT GO
THE WOMAN BEING TAKEN ILL WITH WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO ENTRUST MY HOUSE AND ALL MY AFFAIRS
WAS SUCH THAT THE TOWN WAS COMPUTED TO HAVE IN IT ABOVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN EVER IT HELD BEFORE NAY SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO SAY IT HAD TWICE AS MANY BECAUSE
I OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIM WHO HAVING BEEN MY MAKER HAD AN UNDISPUTED RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN DISPOSING OF ME AND THAT THEN THERE HAD BEEN
AS ANYONE MIGHT PERCEIVE BY THEIR APPEARANCE THIS WAS A VERY TERRIBLE AND MELANCHOLY THING TO SEE AND AS IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT BUT LOOK ON FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
TWENTY MORE WHO WERE REALLY DEAD OF THE PLAGUE IN THAT PARISH BUT HAD BEEN SET DOWN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER OR OTHER DISTEMPERS BESIDES OTHERS CONCEALED
UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE WERE FIFTY DIED THAT WEEK OF THE PLAGUE THE NEXT BILL WAS FROM THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY TO THE THIRTIETH WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE PLAGUE WAS SEVENTEEN BUT
BUT THEY WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT STREET NEITHER ON ONE SIDE
THIS HURRY I SAY CONTINUED SOME WEEKS THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS RUMOURED THAT AN ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED OUT
AND AFTERWARDS FETCHED A ROUND FARTHER INTO BUCKINGHAMSHIRE OR BEDFORDSHIRE TO A RETREAT HE HAD FOUND OUT THERE FOR HIS FAMILY IT WAS A VERY ILL TIME TO BE SICK IN
TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
I OBEYED THIS LAY CLOSE TO ME AND MY MIND SEEMED MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED TO STAY THAN EVER AND SUPPORTED WITH A SECRET SATISFACTION THAT I SHOULD BE KEPT ADD TO THIS THAT
NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALREADY INFECTED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MAY YET THE WEATHER WAS TEMPERATE VARIABLE AND COOL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE HAD STILL SOME HOPES THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED THEM WAS THAT THE CITY WAS HEALTHY
TWO PHYSICIANS AND A SURGEON WERE ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND MAKE INSPECTION THIS THEY DID AND FINDING EVIDENT TOKENS OF THE SICKNESS UPON BOTH THE BODIES THAT WERE DEAD
FOR SAYS HE IS IT NOT AS REASONABLE THAT YOU SHOULD TRUST GOD WITH THE CHANCE OR RISK OF LOSING YOUR TRADE AS THAT YOU SHOULD STAY IN SO EMINENT A POINT OF DANGER AND TRUST HIM WITH YOUR LIFE I COULD NOT
BECAUSE THOU HAST MADE THE LORD WHICH IS MY REFUGE EVEN THE MOST HIGH THY HABITATION THERE SHALL NO EVIL BEFALL THEE NEITHER SHALL ANY PLAGUE COME NIGH THY DWELLING
TO LONDON I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT AS JERUSALEM WAS BESIEGED BY THE ROMANS WHEN THE JEWS WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER BY WHICH MEANS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED THERE
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE ORDINARY BURIALS INCREASED IN NUMBER CONSIDERABLY FOR EXAMPLE FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TO JANUARY THIRD
AMONG THE WEALTHIEST OF THE PEOPLE AND SUCH PEOPLE AS WERE UNENCUMBERED WITH TRADES AND BUSINESS BUT OF THE REST THE GENERALITY STAYED AND SEEMED TO ABIDE THE WORST SO THAT
AND HAVING THE KEY IN MY POCKET I USED TO GO INTO THE HOUSE AND OVER MOST OF THE ROOMS TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL FOR THOUGH IT BE SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO TELL
AND OF THE LAST THE BILL ITSELF SAID
AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
FOR IF ANY ONE COMPLAINED IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SAID HE HAD THE PLAGUE
BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
NOW AS THERE HAD NONE DIED IN THE CITY FOR ALL THIS TIME MY LORD MAYOR GAVE CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY TO ALL THOSE WHO LIVED IN THE NINETY SEVEN PARISHES AND TO THOSE WITHIN THE LIBERTIES TOO
HE WAS AS ABLE TO KEEP ME IN A TIME OF THE INFECTION AS IN A TIME OF HEALTH AND IF HE DID NOT THINK FIT TO DELIVER ME STILL I WAS IN HIS HANDS
BUT THIS WAS ALL KNAVERY AND COLLUSION
IT WAS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT I AMONG THE REST OF MY NEIGHBOURS HEARD IN ORDINARY DISCOURSE THAT THE PLAGUE WAS RETURNED AGAIN IN HOLLAND
THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
WHEREAS THE EUROPEANS OR CHRISTIAN MERCHANTS WHO KEPT THEMSELVES RETIRED AND RESERVED GENERALLY ESCAPED THE CONTAGION UPON THESE ARGUMENTS MY BROTHER CHANGED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN
SAINT BRIDE'S EIGHT
ONLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT HIRE A HORSE TO GO OR MY FELLOW WAS RUN AWAY THAT WAS TO ATTEND ME WAS RIDICULOUS SINCE AT THE TIME I HAD MY HEALTH AND LIMBS AND OTHER SERVANTS AND MIGHT
ABOUT THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BEING FROM HEAVEN I MENTION THIS STORY ALSO AS THE BEST METHOD I CAN ADVISE ANY PERSON TO TAKE IN SUCH A CASE ESPECIALLY IF HE BE ONE THAT MAKES CONSCIENCE OF HIS DUTY
FROM THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY CALLING AND THE CARE DUE FROM ME FOR THE PRESERVATION OF MY EFFECTS WHICH WERE AS I MIGHT SAY MY ESTATE ALSO THE INTIMATIONS WHICH I THOUGHT
MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
WERE RETURNING OR SENT FROM THE COUNTRIES TO FETCH MORE PEOPLE BESIDES INNUMERABLE NUMBERS OF MEN ON HORSEBACK SOME ALONE OTHERS WITH SERVANTS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING
AT THE SAME TIME IN LONDON AND NOT MANY YEARS BEFORE COME OVER FROM PORTUGAL AND ADVISING WITH HIM HIS ANSWER WAS IN THREE WORDS
A LITTLE HARDENED IT IS TRUE A VAST MANY PEOPLE FLED AS I HAVE OBSERVED YET THEY WERE CHIEFLY FROM THE WEST END OF THE TOWN AND FROM THAT WE CALL THE HEART OF THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY
AND WOULD BE DIRECTED WHAT TO DO IN IT NAMELY THAT HE SHOULD KEEP HIS EYE UPON THE PARTICULAR PROVIDENCES WHICH OCCUR AT THAT TIME AND LOOK UPON THEM COMPLEXLY AS THEY REGARD ONE ANOTHER
THAT ANY SHOULD HAVE HEARTS SO HARDENED IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A CALAMITY AS TO ROB AND STEAL YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT ALL SORTS OF VILLAINIES AND EVEN LEVITIES AND DEBAUCHERIES
IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WRITTEN BY A CITIZEN WHO CONTINUED ALL THE WHILE IN LONDON NEVER MADE PUBLIC BEFORE
TO NOTE WHAT BECAME OF ME I HAD TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BEFORE ME
BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
AND SEVERAL COUNCILS WERE HELD ABOUT WAYS TO PREVENT ITS COMING OVER BUT ALL WAS KEPT VERY PRIVATE HENCE IT WAS THAT THIS RUMOUR DIED OFF AGAIN AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO FORGET IT AS A THING WE WERE VERY LITTLE CONCERNED IN
AND THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE MONARCHY BEING RESTORED HAD FLOCKED TO LONDON TO SETTLE IN BUSINESS OR TO DEPEND UPON AND ATTEND THE COURT FOR REWARDS OF SERVICES PREFERMENTS AND THE LIKE
I READ ON TO THE SEVENTH VERSE EXCLUSIVE AND AFTER THAT INCLUDED THE TENTH AS FOLLOWS I WILL SAY OF THE LORD HE IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS MY GOD
WITHOUT ANY OVERSEER OR PERSON FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH THEM HAD BEEN TO HAZARD THE LOSS NOT ONLY OF MY TRADE BUT OF MY GOODS AND INDEED OF ALL I HAD IN THE WORLD I HAD AN ELDER BROTHER
ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT AS IT HAD GOTTEN SOME VENT IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE SECRETARIES OF STATE GOT KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND CONCERNING THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN OF THE TRUTH
FROM THE BEGINNING OF APRIL ESPECIALLY THEY STOOD AT TWENTY FIVE EACH WEEK TILL THE WEEK FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE TWENTY FIFTH
THIS HURRY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SUCH FOR SOME WEEKS THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DOOR WITHOUT EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SUCH PRESSING AND CROWDING THERE
CONCERNING MY OWN CASE AND HOW I SHOULD DISPOSE OF MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY WHETHER I SHOULD RESOLVE TO STAY IN LONDON OR SHUT UP MY HOUSE AND FLEE AS MANY OF MY NEIGHBOURS DID I HAVE SET THIS PARTICULAR DOWN
IN ONE WEEK SINCE THE PRECEDING VISITATION OF SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX HOWEVER ALL THIS WENT OFF AGAIN AND THE WEATHER PROVING COLD AND THE FROST WHICH BEGAN IN DECEMBER
THEY WOULD GO UNCONCERNED INTO INFECTED PLACES AND CONVERSE WITH INFECTED PERSONS BY WHICH MEANS THEY DIED AT THE RATE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND A WEEK
THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR THE PLAGUE WAS TO RUN AWAY FROM IT AS TO MY ARGUMENT OF LOSING MY TRADE MY GOODS OR DEBTS HE QUITE CONFUTED ME HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING WHICH
IT WAS NOW MID JULY AND THE PLAGUE WHICH HAD CHIEFLY RAGED AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN AND AS I SAID BEFORE IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN
SO FULLY BECAUSE I KNOW NOT BUT IT MAY BE OF MOMENT TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER ME IF THEY COME TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SAME DISTRESS AND TO THE SAME MANNER OF MAKING THEIR CHOICE AND THEREFORE
IN HIM WILL I TRUST SURELY HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND FROM THE NOISOME PESTILENCE HE SHALL COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS AND UNDER HIS WINGS SHALT THOU TRUST
IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
AND IT WAS PRINTED IN THE WEEKLY BILL OF MORTALITY IN THE USUAL MANNER THUS PLAGUE TWO PARISHES INFECTED ONE
YET THERE DIED NO MORE OF THE PLAGUE ON THE WHOLE SOUTHWARK SIDE OF THE WATER THAN SIXTEEN BUT THIS FACE OF THINGS SOON CHANGED
SAINT BRIDE'S SIX SAINT JAMES'S NINE
AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOUGH THEY WERE AT FIRST IN A MOST INEXPRESSIBLE CONSTERNATION YET AS I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE DISTEMPER INTERMITTED OFTEN AT FIRST SO THEY WERE AS IT WERE
AND AT THAT JUNCTURE I HAPPENED TO STOP TURNING OVER THE BOOK
WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AND IN WHICH WAS EMBARKED ALL MY EFFECTS IN THE WORLD AND THE OTHER WAS THE PRESERVATION OF MY LIFE IN SO DISMAL A CALAMITY AS I SAW APPARENTLY WAS COMING UPON THE WHOLE CITY AND WHICH
AND AS I HAD ALREADY PREPARED EVERYTHING AS WELL AS I COULD AS TO MY BUSINESS AND WHOM TO ENTRUST MY AFFAIRS WITH I HAD LITTLE TO DO BUT TO RESOLVE I WENT HOME THAT EVENING GREATLY OPPRESSED IN MY MIND
MY TRADE WAS A SADDLER AND AS MY DEALINGS WERE CHIEFLY NOT BY A SHOP OR CHANCE TRADE BUT AMONG THE MERCHANTS TRADING TO THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA SO MY EFFECTS LAY VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF SUCH
THERE WAS NONE OF THE PLAGUE AND BUT FOUR OF THE SPOTTED FEVER BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT RETURNED AGAIN AND THE DISTEMPER WAS SPREAD INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER PARISHES
I TOLD HIM THAT I INCLINED TO STAY AND TAKE MY LOT IN THAT STATION IN WHICH GOD HAD PLACED ME AND THAT IT SEEMED TO BE MADE MORE ESPECIALLY MY DUTY ON THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID
SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
TO GET PASSES AND CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH FOR SUCH AS TRAVELLED ABROAD FOR WITHOUT THESE THERE WAS NO BEING ADMITTED TO PASS THROUGH THE TOWNS UPON THE ROAD OR TO LODGE IN ANY INN
IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AND THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN IN WHITECHAPPEL THAT IS TO SAY THE BROAD STREET WHERE I LIVED INDEED NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT WAGGONS AND CARTS WITH GOODS
WHAT WAS MY DUTY TO DO AND I STATED THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH MY BROTHER HAD PRESSED ME TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND I SET AGAINST THEM THE STRONG IMPRESSIONS WHICH I HAD ON MY MIND FOR STAYING THE VISIBLE CALL I SEEMED TO HAVE
YET THERE WAS FOURTEEN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER AS WELL AS FOURTEEN OF THE PLAGUE
SAINT JAMES'S SEVEN
THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
BUT I HAD A FAMILY OF SERVANTS WHOM I KEPT AT MY BUSINESS HAD A HOUSE SHOP AND WAREHOUSES FILLED WITH GOODS AND IN SHORT TO LEAVE THEM ALL AS THINGS IN SUCH A CASE MUST BE LEFT THAT IS TO SAY
COACHES FILLED WITH PEOPLE OF THE BETTER SORT AND HORSEMEN ATTENDING THEM AND ALL HURRYING AWAY THEN EMPTY WAGGONS AND CARTS APPEARED AND SPARE HORSES WITH SERVANTS WHO IT WAS APPARENT
YET BEING VERY ILL BOTH IN MY HEAD AND IN MY STOMACH I WAS NOT WITHOUT APPREHENSION THAT I REALLY WAS INFECTED BUT IN ABOUT THREE DAYS I GREW BETTER THE THIRD NIGHT I RESTED WELL
BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
IT WAS BROUGHT SOME SAID FROM ITALY OTHERS FROM THE LEVANT AMONG SOME GOODS WHICH WERE BROUGHT HOME BY THEIR TURKEY FLEET OTHERS SAID IT WAS BROUGHT FROM CANDIA OTHERS FROM CYPRUS
AS OTHERS RETIRED REALLY FRIGHTED WITH THE DISTEMPER IT WAS A MERE DESOLATING OF SOME OF THE STREETS BUT THE FRIGHT WAS NOT YET NEAR SO GREAT IN THE CITY ABSTRACTLY SO CALLED
SAINT JAMES'S SIX BESIDES THIS IT WAS OBSERVED WITH GREAT UNEASINESS BY THE PEOPLE THAT THE WEEKLY BILLS IN GENERAL INCREASED VERY MUCH DURING THESE WEEKS ALTHOUGH IT WAS AT A TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN
WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
HOWEVER GREAT IT WAS MY FEARS PERHAPS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE'S REPRESENTED TO BE MUCH GREATER THAN IT COULD BE
AND I BEGAN TO RESOLVE TO GO AND ACCORDINGLY MADE ALL THINGS READY FOR IN SHORT THE INFECTION INCREASED ROUND ME
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WENT TO OXFORD WHERE IT PLEASED GOD TO PRESERVE THEM AND THE DISTEMPER DID NOT AS I HEARD OF SO MUCH AS TOUCH THEM FOR WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT
SAW WITH INDIGNATION THE INCREASING SPLENDOUR AND PROFUSION OF WHITEHALL AND WERE IMMOVABLY FIXED IN THE BELIEF THAT THE MONEY WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE SUPPORTED THEIR HOUSEHOLDS HAD BY SOME INEXPLICABLE PROCESS
THE PLACE WHERE ELIZABETH HAD WITH MANLY SPIRIT HURLED FOUL SCORN AT PARMA AND SPAIN WAS INSULTED BY THE INVADERS THE ROAR OF FOREIGN GUNS WAS HEARD
THE MOST FORMIDABLE POWER IN THE WORLD DICTATED TERMS OF PEACE TO THE UNITED PROVINCES AVENGED THE COMMON INJURIES OF CHRISTENDOM ON THE PIRATES OF BARBARY VANQUISHED THE SPANIARDS BY LAND AND SEA
THE MARRIAGE WAS GENERALLY DISLIKED AND THE MURMURS BECAME LOUD WHEN IT APPEARED THAT THE KING WAS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE ANY LEGITIMATE POSTERITY DUNKIRK WON BY OLIVER FROM SPAIN WAS SOLD TO LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH KING OF FRANCE
AND WERE DISPOSED TO DOUBT WHETHER THE SULLEN PRECISENESS OF PRAISE GOD BAREBONE MIGHT NOT BE PREFERABLE TO THE OUTRAGEOUS PROFANENESS AND LICENTIOUSNESS OF THE BUCKINGHAMS AND SEDLEYS EVEN IMMORAL MEN
WERE SUMMONED TO THE ASSEMBLY WHICH WAS TO LEGISLATE AT WESTMINSTER FOR EVERY PART OF THE BRITISH ISLES TO CREATE A HOUSE OF LORDS WAS A LESS EASY TASK DEMOCRACY DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SUPPORT OF PRESCRIPTION
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE ROUNDHEADS THE ANGLICAN CHURCH THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ENGLAND SCOTLAND IRELAND YET SUCH WAS HIS GENIUS AND RESOLUTION
TOOK OFF THE EDGE OF THE PUBLIC APPETITE FOR REVENGE YET WAS THE ANGER EXCITED BY THE PROFUSION AND NEGLIGENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND BY THE MISCARRIAGES OF THE LATE WAR BY NO MEANS EXTINGUISHED THE COUNSELLORS OF CHARLES
THE CHANCELLOR FELL WITH A GREAT RUIN THE SEAL WAS TAKEN FROM HIM THE COMMONS IMPEACHED HIM HIS HEAD WAS NOT SAFE HE FLED FROM THE COUNTRY AN ACT WAS PASSED WHICH DOOMED HIM TO PERPETUAL EXILE
AND PINED FOR THE FLESHPOTS THE TASKMASTERS AND THE IDOLATRIES OF EGYPT THE OBJECT OF THE WARLIKE SAINTS WHO SURROUNDED CROMWELL WAS THE SETTLEMENT OF A FREE AND PIOUS COMMONWEALTH
THE KING FEASTED WITH THE LADIES OF HIS SERAGLIO AND AMUSED HIMSELF WITH HUNTING A MOTH ABOUT THE SUPPER ROOM THEN AT LENGTH TARDY JUSTICE WAS DONE TO THE MEMORY OF OLIVER EVERYWHERE MEN MAGNIFIED HIS VALOUR
DISGUSTED AND ALARMED HIM NOTHING WOULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO PUT THE GREAT SEAL TO A WRIT FOR RAISING SHIPMONEY OR TO GIVE HIS VOICE IN COUNCIL FOR COMMITTING A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO THE TOWER ON ACCOUNT OF WORDS SPOKEN IN DEBATE
AND TO CLAMOUR FOR PROTECTING LAWS FROM IRELAND THE VICTORIOUS CHIEF
DREW ON HIM MUCH DESERVED AND SOME UNDESERVED CENSURE
AND BY ALL WHO PITIED THEM AS AN IMPLACABLE BIGOT
AS THE ARMY WOULD BEAR THAT HIS ELEVATION TO POWER MIGHT NOT SEEM TO BE MERELY HIS OWN ACT HE CONVOKED A COUNCIL COMPOSED PARTLY OF PERSONS ON WHOSE SUPPORT HE COULD DEPEND AND PARTLY OF PERSONS WHOSE OPPOSITION HE MIGHT SAFELY DEFY
AFTER CUTTING DOWN THEIR OAKS AND MELTING THEIR PLATE TO HELP HIS FATHER NOW WANDERED ABOUT IN THREADBARE SUITS AND DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR A MEAL AT THE SAME TIME A SUDDEN FALL OF RENTS TOOK PLACE
TO WRING FROM HIM HIS CONSENT TO LAWS WHICH HE DISLIKED TO BREAK UP CABINETS TO DICTATE THE COURSE OF FOREIGN POLICY AND EVEN TO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION OF WAR TO THE ROYAL OFFICE AND THE ROYAL PERSON THEY LOUDLY AND SINCERELY
HIS PICTURE GALLERY FILLED WITH MASTERPIECES OF VANDYKE WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN THE PROPERTY OF RUINED CAVALIERS HIS PALACE WHICH REARED ITS LONG AND STATELY FRONT RIGHT OPPOSITE TO THE HUMBLER RESIDENCE OF OUR KINGS
UNDER THEIR INSPECTION AND CONTROL A SOLEMN AND MELANCHOLY COURT THIS MOCK ROYALTY WAS OF SHORT DURATION IN TWO GREAT BATTLES CROMWELL ANNIHILATED THE MILITARY FORCE OF SCOTLAND CHARLES FLED FOR HIS LIFE AND
NO VESTIGE WAS LEFT THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT MADE LAWS FOR SCOTLAND ENGLISH JUDGES HELD ASSIZES IN SCOTLAND EVEN THAT STUBBORN CHURCH WHICH HAS HELD ITS OWN AGAINST SO MANY GOVERNMENTS SCARCE DARED TO UTTER AN AUDIBLE MURMUR
HE HAD DURING THE THIRTEEN YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED GONE THROUGH A POLITICAL EDUCATION OF NO COMMON KIND HE HAD BEEN A CHIEF ACTOR IN A SUCCESSION OF REVOLUTIONS HE HAD BEEN LONG THE SOUL AND AT LAST THE HEAD OF A PARTY
WOULD WHEN SUMMONED TO THEIR HOUSE BY THE WRIT OF A KING IN POSSESSION GLADLY RESUME THEIR ANCIENT FUNCTIONS NORTHUMBERLAND AND BEDFORD MANCHESTER AND PEMBROKE WOULD BE PROUD TO BEAR THE CROWN AND THE SPURS THE SCEPTRE AND THE GLOBE
AND TO THE PRESBYTERIANS OF SCOTLAND BOTH THOSE COUNTRIES LATELY IN REBELLION AGAINST CHARLES THE FIRST NOW ACKNOWLEDGED THE AUTHORITY OF CHARLES THE SECOND BUT EVERYTHING YIELDED TO THE VIGOUR AND ABILITY OF CROMWELL
ILL QUALIFIED TO CONTEND AGAINST THE GREAT MEN WHO THEN DIRECTED THE ARMS OF HOLLAND
THE VICES OF THE OLD REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO SERIOUS AS THEY AFTERWARDS BECAME HAD ALREADY BEEN REMARKED BY FARSIGHTED MEN CROMWELL REFORMED THAT SYSTEM ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES ON WHICH MISTER PITT
WAS NOT HEAVY WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE NEIGHBOURING STATES AND WITH THE RESOURCES OF ENGLAND PROPERTY WAS SECURE EVEN THE CAVALIER WHO REFRAINED FROM GIVING DISTURBANCE TO THE NEW SETTLEMENT ENJOYED IN PEACE
THE SPEAKER WAS PULLED OUT OF HIS CHAIR THE MACE TAKEN FROM THE TABLE THE ROOM CLEARED AND THE DOOR LOCKED THE NATION WHICH LOVED NEITHER OF THE CONTENDING PARTIES BUT WHICH WAS FORCED IN ITS OWN DESPITE
UNDER THE RULE OF HER LEGITIMATE KINGS ENGLAND HAD ALREADY CEASED TO STRUGGLE BUT THE TWO OTHER KINGDOMS WHICH HAD BEEN GOVERNED BY THE STUARTS WERE HOSTILE TO THE NEW REPUBLIC THE INDEPENDENT PARTY WAS EQUALLY ODIOUS TO THE ROMAN CATHOLICS OF IRELAND
EVEN WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG LAW STUDENT LIVING MUCH WITH MEN OF WIT AND PLEASURE HIS NATURAL GRAVITY AND HIS RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES HAD TO A GREAT EXTENT
ENCROACHING ON THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT THE GENTLEMEN WHO AFTER THE RESTORATION FILLED THE LOWER HOUSE THOUGH THEY ABHORRED THE PURITAN NAME
A HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS A NECESSARY PART OF THE NEW POLITY IN CONSTITUTING THIS BODY THE PROTECTOR SHOWED A WISDOM AND A PUBLIC SPIRIT WHICH WERE NOT DULY APPRECIATED BY HIS CONTEMPORARIES
IT COULD IN NO WAY PROMOTE THE NATIONAL INTERESTS IT INVOLVED US IN INGLORIOUS UNPROFITABLE
AND IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO DEAL AT ONCE
ALL THE REFORMED CHURCHES SCATTERED OVER ROMAN CATHOLIC KINGDOMS ACKNOWLEDGED CROMWELL AS THEIR GUARDIAN THE HUGUENOTS OF LANGUEDOC THE SHEPHERDS WHO IN THE HAMLETS OF THE ALPS PROFESSED A PROTESTANTISM OLDER THAN THAT OF AUGSBURG
EXCLAIMED THAT THE STATE COULD BE SAVED ONLY BY CALLING THE OLD SOLDIERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH TO ARMS SOON THE CAPITAL BEGAN TO FEEL THE MISERIES OF A BLOCKADE FUEL WAS SCARCELY TO BE PROCURED TILBURY FORT
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO OVERPOWER AND CRUSH EVERYTHING THAT CROSSED HIS PATH TO MAKE HIMSELF MORE ABSOLUTE MASTER OF HIS COUNTRY THAN ANY OF HER LEGITIMATE KINGS HAD BEEN AND TO MAKE HIS COUNTRY MORE DREADED AND RESPECTED THAN SHE HAD BEEN DURING MANY GENERATIONS
WAS A TASK TOO HARD FOR THAT ADMINISTRATION
ASKED BY WHAT RIGHT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD BEEN PURGED OF ITS MOST RESPECTABLE MEMBERS AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS DEPRIVED OF ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS AND TOLD HIS WEEPING HEARERS THAT HE WAS DEFENDING NOT ONLY HIS OWN CAUSE BUT THEIRS
WITH MANY STRUGGLES AND MISGIVINGS AND PROBABLY NOT WITHOUT MANY PRAYERS THE DECISION WAS MADE CHARLES WAS LEFT TO HIS FATE THE MILITARY SAINTS RESOLVED THAT IN DEFIANCE OF THE OLD LAWS OF THE REALM
AND WHICH WERE SUBJECT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN ALONE THE COUNTRY HE MAINTAINED WOULD NEVER BE WELL GOVERNED TILL THE KNIGHTS OF SHIRES AND THE BURGESSES WERE CONTENT TO BE WHAT THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD BEEN IN THE DAYS OF ELIZABETH
WHATEVER THE CIVIL TROUBLES HAD LEFT HEM THE LAWS WERE VIOLATED ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE SAFETY OF THE PROTECTOR'S PERSON AND GOVERNMENT WAS CONCERNED JUSTICE WAS ADMINISTERED BETWEEN MAN AND MAN
THE FEW MEMBERS WHO MADE UP WHAT WAS CONTEMPTUOUSLY CALLED THE RUMP OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD NO MORE CLAIM THAN THE MILITARY CHIEFS TO BE ESTEEMED THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION THE DISPUTE WAS SOON BROUGHT TO A DECISIVE ISSUE CROMWELL FILLED THE HOUSE WITH ARMED MEN
ENCOMPASSED HIM THICK ON EVERY SIDE HAD HE BEEN A CRUEL LICENTIOUS AND RAPACIOUS PRINCE THE NATION MIGHT HAVE FOUND COURAGE IN DESPAIR AND MIGHT HAVE MADE A CONVULSIVE EFFORT TO FREE ITSELF FROM MILITARY DOMINATION
BUT CONSTANT TROUBLES WHICH MUST BE SUPPRESSED BY THE CONSTANT USE OF THE SWORD HE THEREFORE WISHED TO RESTORE IN ALL ESSENTIALS THAT ANCIENT CONSTITUTION WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HAD ALWAYS LOVED AND FOR WHICH THEY NOW PINED
OR A PRAYER MEETING AT HUNTINGDON HE SAW THAT SOME SCHEMES OF INNOVATION FOR WHICH HE HAD ONCE BEEN ZEALOUS WHETHER GOOD OR BAD IN THEMSELVES WERE OPPOSED TO THE GENERAL FEELING OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT IF HE PERSEVERED IN THOSE SCHEMES HE HAD NOTHING BEFORE HIM
HOW OLIVER'S PARLIAMENTS WERE CONSTITUTED HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY OF LITTLE MOMENT FOR HE POSSESSED THE MEANS OF CONDUCTING THE ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT THEIR SUPPORT AND IN DEFIANCE OF THEIR OPPOSITION
A PESTILENCE SURPASSING IN HORROR ANY THAT DURING THREE CENTURIES HAD VISITED THE ISLAND SWEPT AWAY IN SIX MOUTHS MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND HUMAN BEINGS AND SCARCELY HAD THE DEAD CART CEASED TO GO ITS ROUNDS
AND HOW WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE WAS NO MORE AMSTERDAM WAS LIGHTED UP AS FOR A GREAT DELIVERANCE AND CHILDREN RAN ALONG THE CANALS SHOUTING FOR JOY THAT THE DEVIL WAS DEAD EVEN ROYALISTS
TO TAKE A STEP WHICH HAS NO PARALLEL IN THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OF STUART
BUT IN A FEW YEARS HE THOUGHT IT SAFE TO PROCEED FURTHER AND TO RESTORE ALMOST EVERY PART OF THE ANCIENT SYSTEM UNDER HEW NAMES AND FORMS THE TITLE OF KING WAS NOT REVIVED
COMPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT TREATED THE MOST SERIOUS MATTERS AS TRIFLES AND MADE TRIFLES ITS SERIOUS BUSINESS A KING MIGHT BE PARDONED FOR AMUSING HIS LEISURE WITH WINE WIT AND BEAUTY BUT IT WAS INTOLERABLE
BEFORE THE RESTORER OF ARISTOCRACY A SENTIMENT OF LOYALTY WOULD GRADUALLY BIND THE PEOPLE TO THE NEW DYNASTY AND
HE HAD AN OBVIOUS MOTIVE FOR WISHING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A BARREN QUEEN AND HE WAS THEREFORE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PURPOSELY RECOMMENDED ONE THE SALE OF DUNKIRK WAS JUSTLY IMPUTED TO HIM
THE PRESBYTERIANS OF SCOTLAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE DOWNFALL OF THEIR CHURCH THE PAPISTS OF IRELAND ATTRIBUTED TO HIM THE LOSS OF THEIR LANDS AS FATHER OF THE DUCHESS OF YORK
THE KINGLY NAME AND DIGNITY THE SENTIMENTS OF CROMWELL WERE WIDELY DIFFERENT HE WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD BEEN
BUT THE GRIEVANCES WHICH THE COUNTRY SUFFERED THOUGH SUCH AS EXCITED SERIOUS DISCONTENT WERE BY NO MEANS SUCH AS IMPEL GREAT MASSES OF MEN TO STAKE THEIR LIVES THEIR FORTUNES AND THE WELFARE OF THEIR FAMILIES AGAINST FEARFUL ODDS
NOT MERELY AS A PLACE OF ARMS AND AS A KEY TO THE LOW COUNTRIES BUT ALSO AS A TROPHY OF ENGLISH VALOUR IT WAS TO THE SUBJECTS OF CHARLES WHAT CALAIS HAD BEEN TO AN EARLIER GENERATION AND WHAT THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR
TO ESTABLISH BY THEIR AID A DICTATORSHIP SUCH AS NO KING HAD EVER EXERCISED BUT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THEIR AID WOULD BE AT ONCE WITHDRAWN FROM A RULER WHO EVEN UNDER STRICT CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINTS
THE PARLIAMENT FORGOT THAT IT WAS BUT THE CREATURE OF THE ARMY THE ARMY WAS LESS DISPOSED THAN EVER TO SUBMIT TO THE DICTATION OF THE PARLIAMENT INDEED
THE GREAT MAJORITY HOWEVER WERE DISPOSED TO SUPPORT THEIR GENERAL AS ELECTIVE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A COMMONWEALTH AGAINST ALL FACTIONS WHICH MIGHT RESIST HIS AUTHORITY
A RULER A PERSECUTOR
REACTION WHICH NEVER CEASED TILL THE THRONE HAD AGAIN BEEN SET UP IN ALL ITS OLD DIGNITY AT FIRST HOWEVER THE SLAYERS OF THE KING SEEMED TO HAVE DERIVED NEW ENERGY FROM THAT SACRAMENT OF BLOOD BY WHICH THEY HAD BOUND THEMSELVES CLOSELY TOGETHER
UNHAPPILY FOR HIM HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF DISPLAYING HIS ADMIRABLE MILITARY TALENTS EXCEPT AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES WHILE HE LIVED HIS POWER STOOD FIRM AN OBJECT OF MINGLED AVERSION ADMIRATION
THE COMMONS ALONE COULD LEGALLY GRANT HIM MONEY THEY COULD NOT BE PREVENTED FROM PUTTING THEIR OWN PRICE ON THEIR GRANTS THE PRICE WHICH THEY PUT ON THEIR GRANTS WAS THIS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH EVERY ONE OF THE KING'S PREROGATIVES
MODERATED ONLY BY THE WISDOM THE SOBRIETY AND THE MAGNANIMITY OF THE DESPOT THE COUNTRY WAS DIVIDED INTO MILITARY DISTRICTS THOSE DISTRICTS WERE PLACED UNDER THE COMMAND OF MAJOR GENERALS
HE HAD AT LEAST GIVEN HER GLORY IN EXCHANGE
THE LORDS UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED THE PROPOSITION THAT THE KING SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL THEIR HOUSE WAS INSTANTLY CLOSED NO COURT KNOWN TO THE LAW WOULD TAKE ON ITSELF THE OFFICE OF JUDGING THE FOUNTAIN OF JUSTICE
BUT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THE CHARGES OF DUNKIRK FELL FAR SHORT OF THE SUMS WHICH WERE WASTED AT COURT IN VICE AND FOLLY IT SEEMED INSUPPORTABLE THAT A SOVEREIGN PROFUSE BEYOND EXAMPLE IN ALL THAT REGARDED HIS OWN PLEASURES
AND DREAD TO HIS SUBJECTS FEW INDEED LOVED HIS GOVERNMENT BUT THOSE WHO HATED IT MOST HATED IT LESS THAN THEY FEARED IT HAD IT BEEN A WORSE GOVERNMENT IT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS STRENGTH HAD IT BEEN A WEAKER GOVERNMENT
OF HIS OWN PALACE IN NO LONG TIME IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT THOSE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS TO WHOM THIS DEED IS TO BE ASCRIBED HAD COMMITTED NOT ONLY A CRIME BUT AN ERROR
FOR SO GREAT A PART OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED ABROAD THAT HE KNEW LESS OF THAT WORLD IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF ON HIS RETURN THAN MANY WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS SONS FOR THESE REASONS HE WAS DISLIKED BY THE COMMONS
IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS MERITS BUT IT HAD MODERATION ENOUGH TO ABSTAIN FROM THOSE OPPRESSIONS WHICH DRIVE MEN MAD AND IT HAD A FORCE AND ENERGY WHICH NONE BUT MEN DRIVEN MAD BY OPPRESSION WOULD VENTURE TO ENCOUNTER
THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COURT ABUSED ITS VICTORY MADE THE REMISSION SPEEDY AND COMPLETE EVERY MODERATE MAN WAS SHOCKED BY THE INSOLENCE CRUELTY AND PERFIDY WITH WHICH THE NONCONFORMISTS WERE TREATED
GONE TO THE FAVOURITES OF THE KING THE MINDS OF MEN WERE NOW IN SUCH A TEMPER THAT EVERY PUBLIC ACT EXCITED DISCONTENT CHARLES HAD TAKEN TO WIFE CATHARINE PRINCESS OF PORTUGAL
IN A FEW MONTHS HE SUBJUGATED IRELAND AS IRELAND HAD NEVER BEEN SUBJUGATED DURING THE FIVE CENTURIES OF SLAUGHTER WHICH HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE LANDING OF THE FIRST NORMAN SETTLERS
AN ADDITION WAS MADE TO THE NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS FOR THE CAPITAL THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE WAS PLACED ON SUCH A FOOTING THAT EVERY MAN OF SUBSTANCE WHETHER POSSESSED OF FREEHOLD ESTATES IN LAND OR NOT HAD A VOTE FOR THE COUNTY IN WHICH HE RESIDED
AND THAT THE RESTORATION OF THE MONARCHY WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THE RESTORATION OF HIS OWN DILAPIDATED FORTUNES NONE OF THESE EXPECTANTS COULD RESTRAIN HIS INDIGNATION WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS AS POOR UNDER THE KING
THAT THE RAGE OF THE POPULACE WAS CHIEFLY DIRECTED HIS WINDOWS WERE BROKEN THE TREES OF HIS GARDEN WERE CUT DOWN AND A GIBBET WAS SET UP BEFORE HIS DOOR BUT NOWHERE WAS HE MORE DETESTED THAN IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
FOR THE WAR WITH HOLLAND HE WAS WITH LESS JUSTICE HELD ACCOUNTABLE HIS HOT TEMPER HIS ARROGANT DEPORTMENT THE INDELICATE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH HE GRASPED AT RICHES THE OSTENTATION WITH WHICH HE SQUANDERED THEM
AND SEPARATED THEMSELVES FOR EVER FROM THE GREAT BODY OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN ENGLAND WAS DECLARED A COMMONWEALTH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS REDUCED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF MEMBERS WAS NOMINALLY THE SUPREME POWER IN THE STATE IN FACT
WHO WISHED TO REPAIR THEIR RUINED FORTUNES
HAD BEEN DETESTED THE PURITAN BETRAYED AND EVIL ENTREATED
WHEN IT WAS NOISED ABROAD THAT THE COURT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO TREAT PAPISTS WITH THE SAME RIGOUR WHICH HAD BEEN SHOWN TO PRESBYTERIANS A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE KING AND THE DUKE WERE NOT SINCERE PROTESTANTS
SEIZED ONE OF THE FINEST WEST INDIAN ISLANDS AND ACQUIRED ON THE FLEMISH COAST A FORTRESS WHICH CONSOLED THE NATIONAL PRIDE FOR THE LOSS OF CALAIS SHE WAS SUPREME ON THE OCEAN SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE PROTESTANT INTEREST
MONARCHY HAS OFTEN STOOD WITHOUT THAT SUPPORT BUT A PATRICIAN ORDER IS THE WORK OF TIME OLIVER FOUND ALREADY EXISTING A NOBILITY OPULENT HIGHLY CONSIDERED AND AS POPULAR WITH THE COMMONALTY
TO THE KINGLY OFFICE THAN TO KING CHARLES THE FIRST OR KING CHARLES THE SECOND WOULD SOON KISS THE HAND OF KING OLIVER THE PEERS WHO NOW REMAINED SULLENLY AT THEIR COUNTRY HOUSES
GIRT WITH A SWORD OF STATE CLAD IN A ROBE OF PURPLE AND PRESENTED WITH A RICH BIBLE IN WESTMINSTER HALL HIS OFFICE WAS NOT DECLARED HEREDITARY BUT HE WAS PERMITTED TO NAME HIS SUCCESSOR AND NONE COULD DOUBT THAT HE WOULD NAME HIS SON
THAT HE SHOULD SINK INTO A MERE LOUNGER AND VOLUPTUARY THAT THE GRAVEST AFFAIRS OF STATE SHOULD BE NEGLECTED AND THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE SHOULD BE STARVED AND THE FINANCES DERANGED IN ORDER THAT HARLOTS AND PARASITES MIGHT GROW RICH
THE AUSTERE PURITANS
AND OF THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL SENTIMENT OF THE NATION THE KING SHOULD EXPIATE HIS CRIMES WITH HIS BLOOD HE FOR A TIME EXPECTED A DEATH LIKE THAT OF HIS UNHAPPY PREDECESSORS EDWARD THE SECOND AND RICHARD THE SECOND
IN ADVANCED YEARS AND IN DECLINING HEALTH TO TURN LIBERTINE ON THE VICES OF THE YOUNG AND GAY HE LOOKED WITH AN AVERSION ALMOST AS BITTER AND CONTEMPTUOUS AS THAT WHICH HE FELT FOR THE THEOLOGICAL ERRORS OF THE SECTARIES
DROVE MANY THOUSANDS TO THE CONTINENT SHIPPED OFF MANY THOUSANDS TO THE WEST INDIES AND SUPPLIED THE VOID THUS MADE BY POURING IN NUMEROUS COLONISTS OF SAXON BLOOD AND OF CALVINISTIC FAITH STRANGE TO SAY UNDER THAT IRON RULE
OR THAT THE DIGNITY WHICH WAS THE JUST REWARD OF HIS PERSONAL MERIT SHOULD BE DECLARED HEREDITARY IN HIS FAMILY
THE PENAL LAWS HAD EFFECTUALLY PURGED THE OPPRESSED PARTY OF THOSE INSINCERE MEMBERS WHOSE VICES HAD DISGRACED IT AND HAD MADE IT AGAIN AN HONEST AND PIOUS BODY OF MEN THE PURITAN A CONQUEROR
THE ROYAL DIGNITY MIGHT DESCEND WITH GENERAL ACQUIESCENCE TO HIS POSTERITY THE ABLEST ROYALISTS WERE OF OPINION THAT THESE VIEWS WERE CORRECT AND THAT IF CROMWELL HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO FOLLOW HIS OWN JUDGMENT THE EXILED LINE WOULD NEVER
TO A PARTY BENT ON EFFECTING A COMPLETE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL REVOLUTION IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR PURPOSE IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THEY SHOULD FIRST BREAK IN PIECES EVERY PART OF THE MACHINERY OF THE GOVERNMENT
HE WAS UNABLE TO PERCEIVE THAT THE TIME WAS FAST APPROACHING WHEN THAT HOUSE IF IT CONTINUED TO EXIST AT ALL MUST BE SUPREME IN THE STATE WHEN THE MANAGEMENT OF THAT HOUSE WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS AND WHEN
HE MISSED NO OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HIS SCORN OF THE MIMICS
WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY ESCAPED THE FATE OF HIS FATHER THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE STUARTS WAS REDUCED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO PROFOUND SUBMISSION OF THAT INDEPENDENCE SO MANFULLY DEFENDED AGAINST THE MIGHTIEST AND ABLEST OF THE PLANTAGENETS
BUT BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN THE CLOSET HE ON EVERY OCCASION EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN THAT GENTLEMEN SO SINCERELY ATTACHED TO MONARCHY SHOULD UNADVISEDLY ENCROACH ON THE PREROGATIVE OF THE MONARCH
PACIFIED AND REGULATED KINGDOMS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE INDEED IF HIS NOTIONS HAD BEEN STILL THE SAME AS IN THE DAYS WHEN HIS MIND WAS PRINCIPALLY OCCUPIED BY HIS FIELDS AND HIS RELIGION AND WHEN THE GREATEST EVENTS WHICH DIVERSIFIED THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE WERE A CATTLE FAIR
SPRANG UP AND GATHERED STRENGTH MANY PERSONS TOO WHO HAD BEEN DISGUSTED BY THE AUSTERITY AND HYPOCRISY OF THE SAINTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH BEGAN TO BE STILL MORE DISGUSTED BY THE OPEN PROFLIGACY OF THE COURT AND OF THE CAVALIERS
WITH THE FATE OF THE CHANCELLOR BEFORE THEIR EYES WERE ANXIOUS FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY THEY ACCORDINGLY ADVISED THEIR MASTER TO SOOTHE THE IRRITATION WHICH PREVAILED BOTH IN THE PARLIAMENT AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND FOR THAT END
BUT HE WAS IN NO DANGER OF SUCH TREASON THOSE WHO HAD HIM IN THEIR GRIPE WERE NOT MIDNIGHT STABBERS WHAT THEY DID THEY DID IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT BE A SPECTACLE TO HEAVEN AND EARTH AND THAT IT MIGHT BE HELD IN EVERLASTING REMEMBRANCE
GENIUS AND PATRIOTISM EVERYWHERE IT WAS REMEMBERED HOW WHEN HE RULED ALL FOREIGN POWERS HAD TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF ENGLAND HOW THE STATES GENERAL NOW SO HAUGHTY HAD CROUCHED AT HIS FEET
CROMWELL HAD TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE WOULD PUT TO HAZARD THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS PARTY THE ATTACHMENT OF HIS ARMY HIS OWN GREATNESS NAY HIS OWN LIFE IN AN ATTEMPT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN VAIN TO SAVE A PRINCE WHOM NO ENGAGEMENT COULD BIND
BOTH OF CAVALIERS AND LEVELLERS THE LOYAL GENTRY DECLARED THAT THEY WERE STILL AS READY AS EVER TO RISK THEIR LIVES FOR THE OLD GOVERNMENT AND THE OLD DYNASTY IF THERE WERE THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF SUCCESS BUT TO RUSH
BY MAKING THE ENGLISH AND PROTESTANT POPULATION DECIDEDLY PREDOMINANT FOR THIS END HE GAVE THE REIN TO THE FIERCE ENTHUSIASM OF HIS FOLLOWERS WAGED WAR RESEMBLING THAT WHICH ISRAEL WAGED ON THE CANAANITES SMOTE THE IDOLATERS WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD
FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS HE WAS EQUALLY DISLIKED BY THE COURT
AND THOSE WHO HAD ASSAILED AND UNDERMINED HIM BEGAN TO STRUGGLE FOR THE FRAGMENTS OF HIS POWER
SINGULARLY UNFAVOURABLE TO THE HEALTH AND VIGOUR OF THE ENGLISH RACE BUT THE MURMURS EXCITED BY THESE ERRORS WERE FAINT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CLAMOURS WHICH SOON BROKE FORTH THE GOVERNMENT ENGAGED IN WAR WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES
HE WAS THE OSTENSIBLE HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WAS THEREFORE HELD RESPONSIBLE EVEN FOR THOSE ACTS WHICH HE HAD STRONGLY BUT VAINLY OPPOSED IN COUNCIL HE WAS REGARDED BY THE PURITANS
HAD THERE BEEN SO LITTLE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION THE UNFORTUNATE ROMAN CATHOLICS INDEED WERE HELD TO BE SCARCELY WITHIN THE PALE OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY BUT THE CLERGY OF THE FALLEN ANGLICAN CHURCH
ALL HIS REGAL DIGNITY AND CONFRONTING DEATH WITH DAUNTLESS COURAGE GAVE UTTERANCE TO THE FEELINGS OF HIS OPPRESSED PEOPLE MANFULLY REFUSED TO PLEAD BEFORE A COURT UNKNOWN TO THE LAW APPEALED FROM MILITARY VIOLENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION
WIDELY AS THEY DIFFERED IN SPIRIT FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT THEY YET HE SAID IMITATED THAT PARLIAMENT IN MEDDLING WITH MATTERS WHICH LAY BEYOND THE SPHERE OF THE ESTATES OF THE REALM
IN HIS PROSPERITY HAD CLAIMED BROTHERHOOD WITH HIM HUNTED FROM HIS HOME FORBIDDEN UNDER SEVERE PENALTIES TO PRAY OR RECEIVE THE SACRAMENT ACCORDING TO HIS CONSCIENCE YET STILL FIRM IN HIS RESOLUTION
THEY MAY DO WHAT THEY WILL WITH ME I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU WHEN I HAD CEASED SPEAKING HE THANKFULLY RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN BUT WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD AH MAXIMILIAN I MAY HAVE MUCH TO SUFFER
WHAT IS IT THAT WE REALLY DESIRE THAT WHICH WE CANNOT OBTAIN NOW TO SEE THINGS WHICH I CANNOT UNDERSTAND TO PROCURE IMPOSSIBILITIES THESE ARE THE STUDY OF MY LIFE I GRATIFY MY WISHES BY TWO MEANS
HE PERCEIVED THAT TWO WERE APPROACHING HIM THE DELAY HAD BEEN OCCASIONED BY A VISIT FROM MADAME DANGLARS AND EUGENIE WHICH HAD BEEN PROLONGED BEYOND THE TIME AT WHICH VALENTINE WAS EXPECTED
THAT I WAS THERE AND MY PRESENCE HAD THE EFFECT OF RENDERING YOU UNJUST IN YOUR COMPARISON NO BUT TELL ME IT IS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE CURIOSITY AND WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY CERTAIN IDEAS PASSING IN MY MIND RELATIVE
FOR THE BEAUTY OF EITHER IS NOT THE ONLY QUALITY WE SEEK IT IS YOUR LOVE WHICH MAKES YOU LOOK UPON EVERYTHING IN THAT LIGHT NO VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I WAS OBSERVING YOU BOTH WHEN YOU WERE WALKING IN THE GARDEN
WHEN TO MORROW WHERE IN MY OFFICE OR IN THE COURT IF YOU LIKE THAT IS THE SUREST PLACE I WILL BE THERE
YOU SEE IT IS NOT MY FAULT AND MAXIMILIAN WAS PATIENT AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN MENTALLY CONTRASTING THE TWO GIRLS ONE FAIR WITH SOFT LANGUISHING EYES A FIGURE GRACEFULLY BENDING LIKE A WEEPING WILLOW
AH MADAME CRIED DEBRAY WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU HOW PALE YOU LOOK IT IS VERY EVIDENT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HER SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT M DE MONTE CRISTO IS RELATING HORRIBLE STORIES TO US DOUBTLESS INTENDING TO FRIGHTEN US TO DEATH
MANY OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE THE IMPORT OF WHICH WAS A UNANIMOUS OPINION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SINISTER ABOUT THE ROOM IS IT NOT SO ASKED MONTE CRISTO LOOK AT THAT LARGE CLUMSY BED HUNG WITH SUCH GLOOMY BLOOD COLORED DRAPERY
AH HOW GOOD YOU ARE TO SAY SO VALENTINE YOU POSSESS A QUALITY WHICH CAN NEVER BELONG TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS IT IS THAT INDEFINABLE CHARM WHICH IS TO A WOMAN WHAT PERFUME IS TO THE FLOWER AND FLAVOR TO THE FRUIT
AND MAJOR CAVALCANTI WHO IS AN ITALIAN WILL TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE OTHER THIS ONE IS I THINK A STERLET SAID CHATEAU RENAUD AND THAT ONE IF I MISTAKE NOT A LAMPREY JUST SO
WELL MY MAN DIGGING FOUND A BOX OR RATHER THE IRON WORK OF A BOX IN THE MIDST OF WHICH WAS THE SKELETON OF A NEWLY BORN INFANT MONTE CRISTO FELT THE ARM OF MADAME DANGLARS STIFFEN WHILE THAT OF VILLEFORT TREMBLED
AND THAT THEIR EXTERIORS CARRIED THE IMPRESS OF THEIR CHARACTERS THIS HOUSE WAS GLOOMY BECAUSE IT WAS REMORSEFUL IT WAS REMORSEFUL BECAUSE IT CONCEALED A CRIME
NAY FURTHER HAVE YOU NEVER ENDEAVORED TO RECALL THE TIME PLACE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR FORMER INTERCOURSE AND FAILING IN THIS ATTEMPT HAVE ALMOST BELIEVED THAT YOUR SPIRITS MUST HAVE HELD CONVERSE WITH EACH OTHER IN SOME STATE OF BEING ANTERIOR TO THE PRESENT
SO THAT I WAS ALTOGETHER FASCINATED WITH HIM THE SAME EVENING SOME FRIENDS OF MINE VISITED ME M DE CHATEAU RENAUD M DEBRAY AND FIVE OR SIX OTHER CHOICE SPIRITS WHOM YOU DO NOT KNOW EVEN BY NAME
HALF SCREENED FROM VIEW BY THE LARGE CHESTNUT TREES WHICH ON ALL SIDES SPREAD THEIR LUXURIANT BRANCHES WE SHALL FIND SOME PEOPLE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE THIS TIME MAXIMILIAN WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE
BUT WITH ME IT HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVE OF EVIL RATHER THAN GOOD WELL VALENTINE SAID MORREL WITH A SIGH WE WILL NOT DISCUSS THE MATTER FURTHER I WILL NOT MAKE A CONFIDANT OF HIM ALAS SAID VALENTINE
WHY NOT BECAUSE I SCARCELY KNOW WHY
AS SHE HAD A COMMUNICATION TO MAKE ON WHICH A PART OF MY FORTUNE DEPENDED LET THEM TAKE MY FORTUNE I AM ALREADY TOO RICH AND PERHAPS WHEN THEY HAVE TAKEN IT THEY WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE AND QUIETNESS
WOULD HAVE ALARMED THEM MUCH MORE THAN A VISIT TO THE ROOM THEY WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THEY BEGAN BY WALKING THROUGH THE APARTMENTS MANY OF WHICH WERE FITTED UP IN THE EASTERN STYLE WITH CUSHIONS AND DIVANS INSTEAD OF BEDS AND PIPES INSTEAD OF FURNITURE
AND INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY DIRECTING HER STEPS TOWARDS THE GATE SHE SEATED HERSELF ON A BENCH AND CAREFULLY CASTING HER EYES AROUND TO CONVINCE HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WATCHED SHE PRESENTLY AROSE AND PROCEEDED QUICKLY TO JOIN MAXIMILIAN
THIS GARDEN HAS NEVER BEEN A CEMETERY WHAT IS DONE TO INFANTICIDES IN THIS COUNTRY ASKED MAJOR CAVALCANTI INNOCENTLY OH THEIR HEADS ARE SOON CUT OFF SAID DANGLARS AH INDEED SAID CAVALCANTI
I TOLD YOU I WAS NOT ON TERMS OF STRICT INTIMACY WITH EUGENIE YES BUT GIRLS TELL EACH OTHER SECRETS WITHOUT BEING PARTICULARLY INTIMATE OWN NOW THAT YOU DID QUESTION HER ON THE SUBJECT AH I SEE YOU ARE SMILING
I OWN THAT YOUR QUESTION EMBARRASSES ME VALENTINE FOR I CANNOT SAY THAT THE COUNT HAS RENDERED ME ANY OSTENSIBLE SERVICE STILL AS I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU I HAVE AN INSTINCTIVE AFFECTION FOR HIM THE SOURCE OF WHICH I CANNOT EXPLAIN TO YOU
THEY WERE PLACED IN A WAGON BUILT ON PURPOSE AND THUS THE STERLET LIVED TWELVE DAYS THE LAMPREY EIGHT AND BOTH WERE ALIVE WHEN MY COOK SEIZED THEM KILLING ONE WITH MILK AND THE OTHER WITH WINE YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME M DANGLARS
WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO MAKE A CONFIDANT OF A FRIEND AND REVEAL TO HIM THE LOVE I BEAR YOU VALENTINE STARTED A FRIEND MAXIMILIAN AND WHO IS THIS FRIEND I TREMBLE TO GIVE MY PERMISSION
HAS PURPOSELY ARRANGED FOR ME TO MEET M AND MADAME DE VILLEFORT AND SOMETIMES I CONFESS I HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO TRY TO READ IN HIS EYES WHETHER HE WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE SECRET OF OUR LOVE MY GOOD FRIEND SAID VALENTINE
AND HE CONDUCTED THE GUESTS BACK TO THE TABLE ON THE LAWN INDEED COUNT SAID MADAME DANGLARS I AM ASHAMED TO OWN IT BUT ALL YOUR FRIGHTFUL STORIES HAVE SO UPSET ME THAT I MUST BEG YOU TO LET ME SIT DOWN AND SHE FELL INTO A CHAIR
AND THAT YOU ARE ONLY NOW OCCUPIED IN A REMINISCENCE OF THE PAST YES
BUT DO YOU NOT FEAR THAT THIS COMMUNICATION MAY RELATE TO YOUR MARRIAGE I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE CASE HOWEVER IT MAY BE VALENTINE YOU MUST NOT BE ALARMED
RARE BIRDS RETAINING THEIR MOST BRILLIANT PLUMAGE ENORMOUS FISH SPREAD UPON MASSIVE SILVER DISHES TOGETHER WITH EVERY WINE PRODUCED IN THE ARCHIPELAGO ASIA MINOR OR THE CAPE
IT IS MARRIAGE ITSELF MARRIAGE IF SHE DISLIKES THAT SO MUCH WHY DID SHE EVER MARRY HERSELF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME MAXIMILIAN ABOUT A YEAR AGO I TALKED OF RETIRING TO A CONVENT
LOOK AT IT AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT WHAT A WICKED LOOKING CROOKED STAIRCASE SAID CHATEAU RENAUD WITH A SMILE
I SHALL MEET THEM THERE AND WHO KNOWS WHAT FUTURE ADVANTAGES MAY RESULT FROM THE INTERVIEW THIS MAY APPEAR TO YOU TO BE NO UNUSUAL COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES NEVERTHELESS I PERCEIVE SOME HIDDEN PLOT IN THE ARRANGEMENT
THEIR AGONY FORMED PART OF THEIR MERIT IF THEY WERE NOT SEEN ALIVE THEY WERE DESPISED WHEN DEAD YES SAID DEBRAY BUT THEN OSTIA IS ONLY A FEW LEAGUES FROM ROME TRUE SAID MONTE CRISTO
BUT THAT CANNOT APPLY TO THE TIME PREVIOUS TO OUR ACQUAINTANCE VALENTINE
NOT BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO DO THAT SAID VALENTINE WITH A SAD SMILE IF SHE OBJECTS TO YOUR MARRYING M D'EPINAY SHE WOULD BE ALL THE MORE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO ANY OTHER PROPOSITION NO MAXIMILIAN IT IS NOT SUITORS TO WHICH MADAME DE VILLEFORT OBJECTS
THE LITTLEST FINGER OF ALL THAT I MAY HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF KISSING IT MAXIMILIAN WE SAID WE WOULD BE TO EACH OTHER AS TWO VOICES TWO SHADOWS AS YOU WILL VALENTINE SHALL YOU BE HAPPY IF I DO WHAT YOU WISH OH YES
I SHOULD TAKE YOU FOR A VISIONARY AND SHOULD TREMBLE FOR YOUR REASON
FOR A DECLARATION TO BE AVAILABLE SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES HE THEN TOOK VILLEFORT'S ARM
VALENTINE MOUNTED ON A BENCH AND PASSED NOT ONLY HER FINGER BUT HER WHOLE HAND THROUGH THE OPENING MAXIMILIAN UTTERED A CRY OF DELIGHT AND SPRINGING FORWARDS SEIZED THE HAND EXTENDED TOWARDS HIM AND IMPRINTED ON IT A FERVENT AND IMPASSIONED KISS
BUT CERTAINLY EVERYTHING APPEARS TO ME BLACK IN THIS HOUSE SAID DEBRAY EVER SINCE VALENTINE'S DOWRY HAD BEEN MENTIONED MORREL HAD BEEN SILENT AND SAD CAN YOU IMAGINE SAID MONTE CRISTO
TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS I DARE SAY IT IS SOMETHING DISPARAGING WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO SAY IT ONLY PROVES HOW LITTLE INDULGENCE WE MAY EXPECT FROM YOUR SEX INTERRUPTED VALENTINE YOU CANNOT AT LEAST DENY THAT YOU ARE VERY HARSH JUDGES OF EACH OTHER
IS BURNING WITH THE DESIRE OF SEEING THIS EXTRAORDINARY NABOB IN HIS OWN HOUSE THEREFORE SHE HAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PREVAILED ON MY FATHER TO ACCOMPANY HER NO NO IT IS AS I HAVE SAID MAXIMILIAN
SOMETHING IN FACT MORE THAN IS APPARENT ON A CASUAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT I BELIEVE THAT THIS SINGULAR MAN WHO APPEARS TO FATHOM THE MOTIVES OF EVERY ONE
BUT I FEAR YOU WILL DEEM IT EVEN MORE ABSURD THAN THE FIRST SO MUCH THE WORSE SAID VALENTINE SMILING IT IS NEVERTHELESS CONCLUSIVE TO MY MIND MY TEN YEARS OF SERVICE HAVE ALSO CONFIRMED MY IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT OF SUDDEN INSPIRATIONS
SHE PASSED OVER TO MONTE CRISTO A BOTTLE FULL OF THE SAME KIND OF RED LIQUID WHOSE GOOD PROPERTIES THE COUNT HAD TESTED ON EDWARD AH SAID MONTE CRISTO TAKING IT FROM HER HAND YES SHE SAID AT YOUR ADVICE I HAVE MADE THE TRIAL
AH YES SAID MONTE CRISTO SMILING IT IS ALL A MATTER OF IMAGINATION WHY SHOULD WE NOT IMAGINE THIS THE APARTMENT OF AN HONEST MOTHER AND THIS BED WITH RED HANGINGS A BED VISITED BY THE GODDESS LUCINA
IN HIS MOST SIMPLE ACTIONS AS WELL AS IN HIS MOST SECRET THOUGHTS I FIND A RELATION TO MY OWN
UTTERED A GROAN AND FAINTED
HAS THE SUN DONE ANYTHING FOR ME NO HE WARMS ME WITH HIS RAYS AND IT IS BY HIS LIGHT THAT I SEE YOU NOTHING MORE HAS SUCH AND SUCH A PERFUME DONE ANYTHING FOR ME NO ITS ODOR CHARMS ONE OF MY SENSES
BUT LET ME HEAR THIS SECOND PROOF WHICH YOU YOURSELF OWN TO BE ABSURD WELL LOOK THROUGH THIS OPENING AND YOU WILL SEE THE BEAUTIFUL NEW HORSE WHICH I RODE HERE AH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE CRIED VALENTINE
AND YET ASTONISHED EVEN UNEASY THOUGH THEY WERE THEY STILL FELT THAT THEY WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE ABSENT THE RECENT EVENTS THE SOLITARY AND ECCENTRIC POSITION OF THE COUNT HIS ENORMOUS NAY ALMOST INCREDIBLE FORTUNE
AND ALL PRESENT EVEN INCLUDING CAVALCANTI AND HIS SON NOTWITHSTANDING THE STIFFNESS OF THE ONE AND THE CARELESSNESS OF THE OTHER WERE THOUGHTFUL ON FINDING THEMSELVES ASSEMBLED AT THE HOUSE OF THIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE MAN
MONTE CRISTO DID THE SAME AND THE REST FOLLOWED THEIR EXAMPLE
IF WE ARE SO IT IS BECAUSE WE GENERALLY JUDGE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXCITEMENT BUT RETURN TO YOUR QUESTION DOES MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS OBJECT TO THIS MARRIAGE WITH M DE MORCERF ON ACCOUNT OF LOVING ANOTHER
I HAVE DONE WRONG FOR I HAVE GIVEN UTTERANCE TO THOUGHTS CONCERNING THAT MAN WHICH I DID NOT EVEN KNOW EXISTED IN MY HEART I DO NOT DENY THE INFLUENCE OF WHICH YOU SPEAK OR THAT I HAVE NOT MYSELF EXPERIENCED IT
AH SAID VALENTINE IN A MOURNFUL TONE DO LET ME SEE THIS MAN MAXIMILIAN HE MAY TELL ME WHETHER I SHALL EVER BE LOVED SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE AMENDS FOR ALL I HAVE SUFFERED MY POOR GIRL YOU KNOW HIM ALREADY I KNOW HIM
BUT COULD YOU NOT COMPROMISE MATTERS AND GIVE UP A PORTION OF YOUR FORTUNE TO HER SON HOW COULD I MAKE SUCH A PROPOSITION ESPECIALLY TO A WOMAN WHO ALWAYS PROFESSES TO BE SO ENTIRELY DISINTERESTED VALENTINE
EXTRAORDINARY DID YOU SAY YES YOU HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR SOME TIME THEN SCARCELY LONGER THAN EIGHT OR TEN DAYS
BUT WHY MUST YOU LEAVE ME SO SOON I DO NOT KNOW PARTICULARS
BUT OF SUCH A KIND AS THE ARABIAN FAIRIES MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO PREPARE EVERY DELICIOUS FRUIT THAT THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE COULD PROVIDE WAS HEAPED IN VASES FROM CHINA AND JARS FROM JAPAN
AND THAT HE LOST EXPRESSLY TO GIVE ME THE MEANS OF PROCURING HIM MY DEAR MAXIMILIAN YOU ARE REALLY TOO FANCIFUL YOU WILL NOT LOVE EVEN ME LONG A MAN WHO ACCUSTOMS HIMSELF TO LIVE IN SUCH A WORLD OF POETRY AND IMAGINATION
WHEN HE FELT THE ARM OF THE BARONESS PRESS UPON HIS OWN NONE OF THIS HAD ESCAPED THE COUNT AND EVEN BY THIS MERE CONTACT OF INDIVIDUALS THE SCENE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED CONSIDERABLE INTEREST FOR AN OBSERVER
DEAR MAXIMILIAN WHY NOT ATTRIBUTE YOUR ESCAPE TO MY CONSTANT PRAYERS FOR YOUR SAFETY WHEN YOU ARE AWAY I NO LONGER PRAY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR YOU YES SINCE YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SAID MORREL SMILING
AND OPENS HIS HAND IN WHICH HE IS SURE TO FIND SOME DELIGHTFUL PRESENT M DE MONTE CRISTO APPEARS TO EXERT A MYSTERIOUS AND ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE INFLUENCE OVER ALL THE MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY IF SUCH BE THE CASE MY DEAR VALENTINE
NOW M DANGLARS ASK THESE GENTLEMEN WHERE THEY ARE CAUGHT STERLETS SAID CHATEAU RENAUD ARE ONLY FOUND IN THE VOLGA AND SAID CAVALCANTI I KNOW THAT LAKE FUSARO ALONE SUPPLIES LAMPREYS OF THAT SIZE
HE WAS INTENTLY WATCHING FOR A SHADOW TO APPEAR AMONG THE TREES AND AWAITING WITH ANXIETY THE SOUND OF A LIGHT STEP ON THE GRAVEL WALK AT LENGTH THE LONG DESIRED SOUND WAS HEARD AND INSTEAD OF ONE FIGURE AS HE HAD EXPECTED
IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DESPISE ME SO WITHOUT ANY REASON AH FORGIVE ME SAID VALENTINE PERCEIVING THE EFFECT WHICH HER WORDS WERE PRODUCING ON MAXIMILIAN
EXACTLY ONE COMES FROM THE VOLGA AND THE OTHER FROM LAKE FUSARO IMPOSSIBLE CRIED ALL THE GUESTS SIMULTANEOUSLY WELL THIS IS JUST WHAT AMUSES ME SAID MONTE CRISTO I AM LIKE NERO CUPITOR IMPOSSIBILIUM
AND THEN WE WILL TAKE COFFEE IN THE GARDEN AFTER DINNER THE PLAY MONTE CRISTO LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT HIS GUESTS
AND THAT MYSTERIOUS STAIRCASE THE PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH NOT TO DISTURB THEIR SLEEP THE DOCTOR AND NURSE PASS OR EVEN THE FATHER CARRYING THE SLEEPING CHILD
THE DRAWING ROOMS WERE DECORATED WITH THE RAREST PICTURES BY THE OLD MASTERS THE BOUDOIRS HUNG WITH DRAPERIES FROM CHINA OF FANCIFUL COLORS FANTASTIC DESIGN AND WONDERFUL TEXTURE AT LENGTH THEY ARRIVED AT THE FAMOUS ROOM
AND I HAVE ALSO A DEEP CONVICTION THAT HEAVEN WOULD NOT HAVE CREATED TWO HEARTS HARMONIZING AS OURS DO AND ALMOST MIRACULOUSLY BROUGHT US TOGETHER TO SEPARATE US AT LAST THOSE ARE KIND AND CHEERING WORDS
SPARKLING IN BOTTLES WHOSE GROTESQUE SHAPE SEEMED TO GIVE AN ADDITIONAL FLAVOR TO THE DRAUGHT ALL THESE LIKE ONE OF THE DISPLAYS WITH WHICH APICIUS OF OLD GRATIFIED HIS GUESTS PASSED IN REVIEW BEFORE THE EYES OF THE ASTONISHED PARISIANS
AND THOSE TWO CRAYON PORTRAITS THAT HAVE FADED FROM THE DAMPNESS DO THEY NOT SEEM TO SAY WITH THEIR PALE LIPS AND STARING EYES WE HAVE SEEN VILLEFORT BECAME LIVID
GOOD EVENING VALENTINE SAID A WELL KNOWN VOICE GOOD EVENING MAXIMILIAN I KNOW I HAVE KEPT YOU WAITING BUT YOU SAW THE CAUSE OF MY DELAY YES I RECOGNIZED MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS
MONTE CRISTO NOTICED THE GENERAL ASTONISHMENT AND BEGAN LAUGHING AND JOKING ABOUT IT GENTLEMEN HE SAID YOU WILL ADMIT THAT WHEN ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF FORTUNE THE SUPERFLUITIES OF LIFE ARE ALL THAT CAN BE DESIRED
AND I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SABRING RIGHT AND LEFT AMONG THE BEDOUINS CAN HAVE DONE TO MERIT YOUR BEING REVEALED TO ME UNLESS INDEED HEAVEN TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THE VICTIMS OF MY SWORD WERE INFIDELS
THAT WILL ACCOUNT TO YOU FOR THE UNRESERVED MANNER WHICH YOU OBSERVED BETWEEN ME AND EUGENIE AS IN SPEAKING OF THE MAN WHOM I COULD NOT LOVE MY THOUGHTS INVOLUNTARILY REVERTED TO HIM ON WHOM MY AFFECTIONS WERE FIXED
WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO EXPEND A THOUSAND LOUIS UPON A DINNER FOR TEN PERSONS BUT ONLY ON THE CONDITION OF EATING PEARLS LIKE CLEOPATRA OR DRINKING REFINED GOLD LIKE LORENZO DE MEDICI
SHE PROPOSED TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE A WALK IN THE GARDEN BEING ANXIOUS TO SHOW THAT THE DELAY WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS A CAUSE OF VEXATION TO HIM WAS NOT OCCASIONED BY ANY NEGLECT ON HER PART
I RECOLLECT COMING FOR MY MOTHER TO LOOK AT IT WHEN M DE SAINT MERAN ADVERTISED IT FOR SALE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO
WELL WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY VALENTINE SO LONG AS I AM SATISFIED AND FEEL THAT EVEN THIS LONG AND PAINFUL SUSPENSE IS AMPLY REPAID BY FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR SOCIETY OR TWO WORDS FROM YOUR LIPS
NO NO SHE ANSWERED I WOULD RATHER REMAIN HERE ARE YOU REALLY FRIGHTENED MADAME SAID MONTE CRISTO OH NO SIR SAID MADAME DANGLARS BUT YOU SUPPOSE SCENES IN A MANNER WHICH GIVES THEM THE APPEARANCE OF REALITY
AND HAVE YOU SUCCEEDED I THINK SO
AND YOU MORREL IN BREAKING A HORSE THAT NO ONE CAN RIDE FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE THESE TWO FISH
BUT AS HE WAS NOT ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN POETICAL IDEAS HE HAD GONE INTO THE GARDEN AND WAS TALKING WITH MAJOR CAVALCANTI ON THE PROJECTED RAILWAY FROM LEGHORN TO FLORENCE MONTE CRISTO SEEMED IN DESPAIR
AH VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IF HE TREATED ME DIPLOMATICALLY THAT IS TO SAY LIKE A MAN WHO WISHES BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER TO OBTAIN A FOOTING IN THE HOUSE SO THAT HE MAY ULTIMATELY GAIN THE POWER OF DICTATING TO ITS OCCUPANTS
MUST FIND FAR TOO LITTLE EXCITEMENT IN A COMMON EVERY DAY SORT OF ATTACHMENT SUCH AS OURS BUT THEY ARE CALLING ME DO YOU HEAR AH VALENTINE SAID MAXIMILIAN GIVE ME BUT ONE FINGER THROUGH THIS OPENING IN THE GRATING ONE FINGER
HE APPEARS RATHER TO AVOID ME AH HE IS NOT GENEROUS NEITHER DOES HE POSSESS THAT SUPERNATURAL PENETRATION WHICH YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM FOR IF HE DID HE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED THAT I WAS UNHAPPY AND IF HE HAD BEEN GENEROUS SEEING ME SAD AND SOLITARY
OH DO NOT GIVE ME CREDIT FOR THIS MADAME IT WAS DONE BY THE ROMANS WHO MUCH ESTEEMED THEM AND PLINY RELATES THAT THEY SENT SLAVES FROM OSTIA TO ROME WHO CARRIED ON THEIR HEADS FISH WHICH HE CALLS THE MULUS AND WHICH FROM THE DESCRIPTION MUST PROBABLY BE THE GOLDFISH
AND ON MY HONOR WITHOUT AT ALL WISHING TO DEPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANY MAN CAN REALLY LOVE HER THE FACT IS MAXIMILIAN
IF YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED THE WOODEN PARTITION WHICH INTERPOSED BETWEEN US AND YOU HAS PROVED BUT A SLIGHT SECURITY COME WHAT DID SHE SAY SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE LOVED NO ONE SAID VALENTINE
YOU WOULD LOVE ME AS MUCH IF I WERE POOR WOULD YOU NOT MAXIMILIAN OH I SHALL ALWAYS LOVE YOU WHAT SHOULD I CARE FOR EITHER RICHES OR POVERTY IF MY VALENTINE WAS NEAR ME AND I FELT CERTAIN THAT NO ONE COULD DEPRIVE ME OF HER
WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED DEBRAY IN A WHISPER OF MADAME DANGLARS NOTHING SHE REPLIED WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT I WANT AIR THAT IS ALL
MEDEAH WAS STANDING AT THE RACK EATING HIS HAY I IMMEDIATELY PUT ON THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE TO WHICH OPERATION HE LENT HIMSELF WITH THE BEST GRACE POSSIBLE
WELL I WENT TO A HORSE DEALER'S WHERE I SAW THIS MAGNIFICENT HORSE WHICH I HAVE NAMED MEDEAH I ASKED THE PRICE
AND THAT IS WHAT IS AMUSING YOU AT THIS MOMENT THIS FISH WHICH SEEMS SO EXQUISITE TO YOU IS VERY LIKELY NO BETTER THAN PERCH OR SALMON
IT WAS ALSO CONSIDERED A LUXURY TO HAVE THEM ALIVE IT BEING AN AMUSING SIGHT TO SEE THEM DIE FOR WHEN DYING THEY CHANGE COLOR THREE OR FOUR TIMES AND LIKE THE RAINBOW WHEN IT DISAPPEARS PASS THROUGH ALL THE PRISMATIC SHADES AFTER WHICH THEY WERE SENT TO THE KITCHEN
AND MAXIMILIAN UNDERSTOOD THAT MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS VISIT HAD AT LAST COME TO AN END IN A FEW MINUTES VALENTINE RE ENTERED THE GARDEN ALONE FOR FEAR THAT ANY ONE SHOULD BE OBSERVING HER RETURN SHE WALKED SLOWLY
I NEVER PLAY FOR I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO AFFORD TO LOSE OR SUFFICIENTLY POOR TO DESIRE TO GAIN BUT I WAS AT MY OWN HOUSE YOU UNDERSTAND SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO SEND FOR THE CARDS WHICH I DID JUST AS THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TO TABLE
WE HAVE AT PISA UGOLINO'S TOWER AT FERRARA TASSO'S PRISON AT RIMINI THE ROOM OF FRANCESCA AND PAOLO YES BUT YOU HAVE NOT THIS LITTLE STAIRCASE SAID MONTE CRISTO OPENING A DOOR CONCEALED BY THE DRAPERY
AND THEN SAID MONTE CRISTO THIS IS NOT ALL WHAT IS THERE MORE SAID DEBRAY WHO HAD NOT FAILED TO NOTICE THE AGITATION OF MADAME DANGLARS
THE OTHER FIVE LEAGUES FROM NAPLES IS IT NOT AMUSING TO SEE THEM BOTH ON THE SAME TABLE WHAT ARE THE TWO FISH ASKED DANGLARS
A CULPRIT TO DEATH YOU M DEBRAY IN PACIFYING A KINGDOM
IT CANNOT BE SURELY VALENTINE YOU ARE MISTAKEN NO INDEED I AM NOT FOR I ASSURE YOU HIS POWER OVER OUR HOUSEHOLD IS ALMOST UNLIMITED COURTED BY MY STEP MOTHER WHO REGARDS HIM AS THE EPITOME OF HUMAN WISDOM
VALENTINE ARRANGED SO THAT MAXIMILIAN COULD SEE HER PASS AND REPASS AND EACH TIME SHE WENT BY SHE MANAGED UNPERCEIVED BY HER COMPANION TO CAST AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK AT THE YOUNG MAN WHICH SEEMED TO SAY HAVE PATIENCE
THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTION OF A LOVER QUICKLY UNDERSTOOD THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SHE WAS INVOLUNTARILY PLACED AND HE WAS COMFORTED BESIDES ALTHOUGH SHE AVOIDED COMING WITHIN SPEAKING DISTANCE
WELL MONSIEUR FRANZ IS HIS FRIEND YOU KNOW WHAT THEN MONSIEUR DE MORCERF HAS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FRANZ ANNOUNCING HIS IMMEDIATE RETURN VALENTINE TURNED PALE AND LEANED HER HAND AGAINST THE GATE
MONTE CRISTO SEEING THAT THE TWO PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD PREPARED THIS SCENE COULD SCARCELY ENDURE IT AND NOT WISHING TO CARRY IT TOO FAR SAID COME GENTLEMEN SOME COFFEE WE SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN IT
WHY DID YOU NOT BRING HIM CLOSE TO THE GATE SO THAT I COULD TALK TO HIM AND PAT HIM HE IS AS YOU SEE A VERY VALUABLE ANIMAL SAID MAXIMILIAN YOU KNOW THAT MY MEANS ARE LIMITED AND THAT I AM WHAT WOULD BE DESIGNATED A MAN OF MODERATE PRETENSIONS
MONTE CRISTO WAITED FOR THE TWO WHO REMAINED THEN WHEN THEY HAD PASSED HE BROUGHT UP THE REAR AND ON HIS FACE WAS A SMILE
AND HERE IT IS BUT HOW COULD YOU HAVE THESE FISH BROUGHT TO FRANCE OH NOTHING MORE EASY EACH FISH WAS BROUGHT OVER IN A CASK ONE FILLED WITH RIVER HERBS AND WEEDS THE OTHER WITH RUSHES AND LAKE PLANTS
WHERE THE SHADE WAS THICKEST ALL THE OTHER GUESTS FOLLOWED
YES SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT THE DOOR WAS TOWARDS THE ROAD BEFORE AND ON THE DAY OF MY MIRACULOUS ESCAPE YOU BROUGHT ME INTO THE HOUSE FROM THE ROAD I REMEMBER YES MADAME SAID MONTE CRISTO
REALLY MADAME HE SAID DID I ALARM YOU MUCH OH NO SIR SHE ANSWERED BUT YOU KNOW THINGS IMPRESS US DIFFERENTLY ACCORDING TO THE MOOD OF OUR MINDS
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN SEE ANYTHING MORE THAN THE MEREST CHANCE IN THIS MEETING PRAY REFLECT A LITTLE MY FATHER WHO NEVER GOES OUT HAS SEVERAL TIMES BEEN ON THE POINT OF REFUSING THIS INVITATION MADAME DE VILLEFORT ON THE CONTRARY
MADAME DANGLARS FELL INTO A LONG SEAT PLACED NEAR THE CHIMNEY OH SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT SMILING ARE YOU COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN UPON THE VERY SEAT PERHAPS UPON WHICH THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED MADAME DANGLARS ROSE SUDDENLY
YES BEFORE WITNESSES OH THIS IS VERY INTERESTING SAID DEBRAY IF THERE REALLY HAS BEEN A CRIME WE WILL INVESTIGATE IT THERE HAS BEEN A CRIME SAID MONTE CRISTO COME THIS WAY GENTLEMEN
THEY SPOKE LITTLE MORE BUT THEIR HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ON THE SWAMPY GROUND WERE A SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE FOR HIM AT LAST
THAT HIS SON'S HEAD HAD BEEN BADLY CUT BY A BLOW WITH A CLUB FROM WALTER FLETCHER
STAND YOU COWARDS RALLY ROUND YOUR LEADER AND IN HIS ENTHUSIASM THE YOUNG PRINCE URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT BUT THE ASSAILANTS WERE MASTERED
AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN WALTER HAD WON THE PRIZE AT THE SPORTS BOTH FOR THE BEST CUDGEL PLAY AND THE BEST SWORD AND BUCKLER PLAY AMONG THE APPRENTICES TO THE GREAT DISGUST OF MANY WHO HAD ALMOST REACHED THE AGE OF MANHOOD AND WERE JUST OUT OF THEIR TIME
YOU NEED NOT FOR THE PRESENT TROUBLE ABOUT THE CHILD'S CALLING
AND NOW MADAM I AM AT YOUR SERVICE DURING THE NIGHT THE WAYFARER'S CLOTHES HAD BEEN DRIED THE CLOAK WAS OF ROUGH QUALITY SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED BY A PEASANT WOMAN BUT THE REST THOUGH OF SOMBRE COLOUR WERE OF GOOD MATERIAL AND FASHION
HE AND HIS MASTER HAD A LONG BOUT TOGETHER WITH CUDGEL OR QUARTERSTAFF SWORD OR AXE
GAVE HIM SO MUCH UNEASINESS THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KEEPING HIM IN ORDER SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY GEOFFREY MOREOVER HE COULD NOT BUT AGREE WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT THE PROMISE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES OFFERED A MORE FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR WALTER
THE ROOF WAS FORMED OF AN OLD BOAT TURNED BOTTOM UPWARDS AND THIS HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BROWN TURF IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PLACE OF CONCEALMENT
YOU HAVE ARRIVED TOO LATE MASTER ROGER THE PRINCE SAID
FOUND THAT HIS GUEST DESIRED TO FIND ONE GILES FLETCHER A MAKER OF BOWS I KNOW HIM WELL THE SMITH SAID THERE ARE MANY WHO DO A LARGER BUSINESS AND HOLD THEIR HEADS HIGHER BUT GILES FLETCHER IS WELL ESTEEMED AS A GOOD WORKMAN WHOSE WARES CAN BE DEPENDED UPON IT IS OFTEN SAID OF HIM
GEOFFREY WAS FAR MORE SYMPATHETIC AND SAID WELL WALTER ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT THAT GAFFER GILES HEARD ME SAY SO I THINK YOU HAVE HAD A PIECE OF RARE GOOD FORTUNE
THE SOONER YOU WILL BE OUT OF YOUR TIME AND SINCE MADGE MARRIED EIGHT YEARS SINCE I HAVE BEEN LONELY IN THE HOUSE AND SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH ME GEOFFREY WARD FOUND HIS FRIEND MORE READY TO ACCEDE TO HIS REQUEST
IT WAS FINE NOW BUT THE STREAM WAS RUNNING DOWN THICK AND TURBID
I WOULD NOT GIVE MUCH FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU TRIED TO FIND THE WAY ALONE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WHEN YOU GOT ME OFF FROM BEING HUNG AFTER THAT LITTLE AFFAIR AT BRUGES
HE SHOULD LONG TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN THE FIELD HE SAID NOTHING OF THIS HOWEVER BUT RENEWED HIS PROMISE TO SPEAK TO GILES FLETCHER
FOR TRAVELERS LIKE HERSELF OFTEN ARRIVED TOO LATE TO ENTER THE GATES AND HAD TO ABIDE OUTSIDE FOR THE NIGHT MOREOVER HOUSE RENT WAS DEAR WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE CROWDED CITY AND MANY WHOSE BUSINESS BROUGHT THEM TO TOWN
WHEN THE GATES ARE OPEN IN THE MORNING I WILL GO FOR I HAVE A FRIEND WITHIN THE CITY WHO WILL METHINKS RECEIVE ME THE TONE OF VOICE AND THE ADDRESSING OF HIMSELF AS GOOD FELLOW AT ONCE CONVINCED THE MAN THAT THE WOMAN BEFORE HIM
THAT WALTER SHOULD BE APPRENTICED TO HIM THAN HE HAD EXPECTED THE BOWYER INDEED WAS A QUIET MAN
WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE KING'S GRANDFATHER SOME TWENTY YEARS BACK BUT AFTER ALL THEY FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY
WITH A BENT BOW IN HIS ARM TAKING AIM AT A SPOT IN THE WALL THROUGH AN OPEN DOOR THREE MEN COULD BE SEEN IN AN INNER WORKSHOP CUTTING AND SHAPING THE WOOD FOR BOWS THE BOWYER
THOUGH INDEED I LIKE WELL TO USE THEM AND WILL PARKER WHO IS TEACHING ME SAYS THAT I SHOW RARE PROMISE BUT IT WOULD NEVER BE TO MY TASTE TO STAND ALL DAY SAWING AND SMOOTHING AND POLISHING ONE BOW IS TO ME MUCH LIKE ANOTHER THOUGH MY FATHER HOLDS THAT THERE ARE RARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM
AND HIS WEIGHT HAS SORELY TRIED ME HIS NAME IS WALTER AND I TRUST SHE ADDED LOOKING AT THE POWERFUL FIGURE OF HER HOST THAT HE WILL GROW UP AS STRAIGHT AND AS STALWART AS YOURSELF
WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT AUGHT LAY CONCEALED WITHIN THEM A CLEVER HIDING PLACE WALTER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF NO WONDER THE POSSE SEARCH THESE SWAMPS IN VAIN THIS IS THE LOWEST AND WETTEST PART OF THE SWAMP AND WOULD BE BUT LIGHTLY SEARCHED
HE WAS UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DISAPPEARANCE THEN HE SAW THAT THE SPOT ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY A MERE CLUMP OF BUSHES NO HIGHER THAN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS REALLY AN ELEVATED HUMMOCK OF GROUND
CITIZEN'S SON THOUGH HE BE MY LORD DE VAUX WILL YOU BID YOUR SQUIRE RIDE AT FULL SPEED TO THE TOWER AND TELL MASTER ROGER THE LEECH TO COME HERE WITH ALL HASTE
WHOM GEOFFREY REPRESENTED AS BEING EAGER TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE SWORD AS WELL AS HOW TO MAKE IT THUS WALTER BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO DIFFERENT STYLES OF FIGHTING
THAT HE COULD SCARCE HAVE A BETTER MASTER SEEING THAT I HAVE FOR THREE YEARS CARRIED AWAY THE PRIZE FOR THE BEST SWORD PLAYER AT THE SPORTS
WITH DAME FLETCHER THEN UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF GEOFFREY WHO INSISTED ON CARRYING THE BOY SHE SET OUT FROM THE SMITH'S COTTAGE THEY PASSED UNDER THE OUTER GATE AND ACROSS THE BRIDGE WHICH LATER ON WAS COVERED WITH A DOUBLE LINE OF HOUSES AND SHOPS
A PLAIN STONE WITH THE NAME DAME ALICE SOMERS MARKING THE GRAVE THE BOY GREW AND THROVE UNTIL AT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD THERE WAS NO STRONGER OR STURDIER LAD OF HIS AGE WITHIN THE CITY BOUNDS
BUT WAS NOW A NARROW STRUCTURE OVER THE GATEWAY ACROSS THE RIVER UPON PIKES WERE A NUMBER OF HEADS AND HUMAN LIMBS THE LADY SHUDDERED AS SHE LOOKED UP
UNTIL SHE RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN GEOFFREY WARD RETURNED THE WOMAN WAS SITTING IN A SETTLE BY THE FIRESIDE DRESSED IN A WARM WOOLEN GARMENT BELONGING TO HIS SISTER MADGE HAD THROWN FRESH WOOD ON THE FIRE WHICH WAS BLAZING BRIGHTLY NOW
AND GENTLY AS BECOMES ONE OF GOOD BLOOD A FEW DAYS LATER LADY ALICE BREATHED HER LAST AND AT HER OWN REQUEST WAS BURIED QUIETLY AND WITHOUT POMP AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD OF THE BOWMAN
REACHED THE TOP OF THE HEAP WELL DONE THE YOUNG PRINCE EXCLAIMED CLAPPING HIS HANDS SEE HOW HE LAYS ABOUT HIM WITH THAT CLUB OF HIS THERE HE HAS KNOCKED DOWN THE LEADER OF THE DEFENDERS AS IF HIS CLUB HAD BEEN A BATTLE AXE WELL DONE YOUNG SIR WELL DONE
WHICH SHE NEEDS SORELY I WILL FETCH AN ARMFUL OF FRESH RUSHES FROM THE SHED AND STREW THEM HERE I WILL SLEEP IN THE SMITHY QUICK GIRL HE SAID SHARPLY
WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT AUGHT LAY AMONG THEM IN THE CENTRE HOWEVER THE GROUND HAD BEEN CUT AWAY AND A LOW DOORWAY ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE BUSHES GAVE ACCESS INTO A HALF SUBTERRANEAN HUT
WHICH HAD MUCH TO DO WITH WALTER'S POSITION AMONG HIS COMRADES THE SKILL AND STRENGTH WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN WIELDING THE HAMMER AND BY PRACTICE WITH THE SWORD RENDERED HIM A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT WITH THE STICKS WHICH FORMED THE WEAPONS IN THE MIMIC BATTLES
THE KNOWLEDGE OF ARMS MAY WELL BE OF USE TO HIM AND I PROMISE YOU THAT SUCH SKILL AS I HAVE I WILL TEACH HIM WHEN HE GROWS OLD ENOUGH TO WIELD SWORD AND BATTLE AXE AS YOU KNOW I MAY WITHOUT BOASTING SAY
THE KNIGHT PAUSED AND LOOKED ROUND AS IF UNCERTAIN OF HIS WAY
HAD DRIVEN THE OTHER OFF FROM A HEAP OF RUBBISH WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED WITHOUT THE WALLS EACH PARTY HAD A FLAG ATTACHED TO A STICK AND THE BOYS WERE ARMED WITH CLUBS SUCH AS THOSE CARRIED BY THE APPRENTICE BOYS MANY OF THEM CARRIED MIMIC SHIELDS MADE OF WOOD
YOUNG AS HE IS TO BE ALREADY HIGHLY SKILLED IN ARMS MEN SAY THAT HE WILL BE A WISE KING AND A GALLANT CAPTAIN SUCH A ONE AS A BRAVE SOLDIER MIGHT BE PROUD TO FOLLOW
I DON'T WANT TO BE TURBULENT WALTER SAID
THE FEVER ABATED BUT LEFT HER PROSTRATE IN STRENGTH FOR A FEW WEEKS SHE LINGERED
TO THE FRIENDS WHOM YOU SEEK THAT IS SHOULD THEY BE KNOWN TO ME BUT IF NOT WE SHALL DOUBTLESS FIND THEM WITHOUT DIFFICULTY SO SAYING THE SMITH RETIRED TO HIS BED OF RUSHES IN THE SMITHY AND SOON AFTERWARDS THE TIRED VISITOR WITH HER BABY
SO THAT HE MAY DO VALIANT DEEDS AND WIN BACK SOME DAY THE TITLE AND HONOUR OF HIS FAMILY GEOFFREY WARD LAUGHED
BUT BERTHA HATH NOTIONS YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN A WIFE TO YOURSELF MASTER GEOFFREY OR YOU WOULD KNOW THAT WOMEN OFT HAVE FANCIES WHICH WANDER WIDELY FROM HARD FACTS AND SHE SAYS SHE WOULD HAVE HIM BROUGHT UP AS A MAN AT ARMS
CROSS LONDON BRIDGE AND WOULD SPEND HOURS IN THE ARMOURER'S FORGE
BELIEVING THAT YOU AND BERTHA WOULD TAKE ME IN AND SHELTER ME IN MY GREAT NEED AYE THAT WILL WE WILLINGLY GILES SAID WAS NOT BERTHA YOUR NURSE AND TO WHOM SHOULD YOU COME IF NOT TO HER BUT WILL IT PLEASE YOU TO MOUNT THE STAIRS FOR BERTHA WILL NOT FORGIVE ME IF I KEEP YOU TALKING DOWN HERE
HERE I WILL LEAVE YOU AND WILL ONE OF THESE DAYS RETURN TO INQUIRE IF YOUR HEALTH HAS TAKEN OUGHT OF HARM BY THE ROUGH BUFFETING OF THE STORM OF YESTER EVEN SO SAYING HE HANDED THE CHILD TO ITS MOTHER
AS ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS WOULD CONCEAL HIS FIGURE HE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT TREAD IN A POOL OR DITCH AND SO BETRAY HIS PRESENCE PUTTING HIS FOOT EACH TIME TO THE GROUND WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION HE MOVED QUIETLY AFTER THEM
HIS FRAME AND MUSCLES DEVELOPED WITH LABOUR AND HE WAS NOW ABLE TO SWING ALL SAVE THE VERY HEAVIEST HAMMERS IN THE SHOP HE HAD NEVER ABATED IN HIS PRACTICE AT ARMS AND EVERY DAY WHEN WORK WAS OVER
IF ONE BOAT RUNS INTO ANOTHER NO ONE NEED BE SURPRISED
I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA I ONLY CAUGHT A FEW WORDS AND MAY BE WRONG
INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO WILL BE KIND TO HIM AND THIS WILL I TRUST BE TOMORROW SAY NOUGHT ABOUT IT GEOFFREY ANSWERED MADGE AND I ARE RIGHT GLAD TO HAVE BEEN OF SERVICE TO YOU
I HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH MY WIFE AND SO FAR SHE AND I ARE NOT OF ONE MIND I THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO KEEP HIM IN IGNORANCE OF HIS BIRTH AND LINEAGE SINCE THE KNOWLEDGE CANNOT BENEFIT HIM AND WILL BUT RENDER HIM DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT
TO INFORM HIS FRIEND GEOFFREY OF THE HONOUR WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIM OF BEING ADDRESSED BY THE PRINCE OF WALES DURING THE INTERVAL HE WAS FORCED TO LIE ABED AND HE WAS SOUNDLY RATED BY MASTER GILES FOR AGAIN GETTING INTO MISCHIEF
AND IN TROTH MASTER WARD METHINKS THAT GOD WOULD DEAL MOST GENTLY WITH HER
AND HIS LANDS LIKE THOSE OF SIR ROLAND HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY THE CROWN THE CHILD UPSTAIRS IS BY RIGHT HEIR TO BOTH ESTATES SEEING THAT HIS UNCLE DIED UNMARRIED
THEY WERE TOO BUSY IN HUNTING DOWN OTHERS WHOM THEY PROCLAIMED TO BE ENEMIES OF THE KING AS THEY HAD WRONGFULLY SAID OF ROLAND WHO HAD BUT DONE HIS DUTY FAITHFULLY TO QUEEN ISABELLA AND WAS ASSUREDLY NO ENEMY OF HER SON
UNTIL THE OCCUPIERS OF THE ATTICS COULD WELL NIGH SHAKE HANDS ACROSS THEY SOON LEFT THE MORE CROWDED STREETS AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT AFTER TEN MINUTES WALKING THE SMITH STOPPED IN FRONT OF A BOWYER SHOP NEAR ALDGATE
THE LEECH POURED SOME CORDIAL FROM A VIAL INTO A SMALL SILVER CUP AND HELD IT TO THE BOY'S LIPS IT WAS POTENT AND NIGH TOOK HIS BREATH AWAY BUT WHEN HE HAD DRUNK IT HE STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET
LAY DOWN ON THE RUSHES IN FRONT OF THE FIRE FOR IN THOSE DAYS NONE OF THE WORKING OR ARTISAN CLASS USED BEDS WHICH WERE NOT INDEED FOR CENTURIES AFTERWARDS IN USAGE BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN THE MORNING GEOFFREY WARD
IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD TAKE HIM SOME DAY AS HIS PARTNER IN THE FORGE AFTER WORK WAS OVER AND THE MEN HAD GONE AWAY
THAT YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR SHARE OF FIGHTING AS STARK AS THAT OF THE ASSAULT OF YON HEAP NOW MY LORDS LET US RIDE ON
SAY NOT MORE ABOUT IT I PRAY YOU THEY PASSED UNDER THE GATEWAY WITH ITS GHASTLY BURDEN AND WERE SOON IN THE CROWDED STREETS OF LONDON HIGH OVERHEAD THE HOUSES EXTENDED EACH STORY ADVANCING BEYOND THAT BELOW IT
WALTER BEING OF AN ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT WAS SOMETIMES WONT OF A SUMMER EVENING WHEN HIS WORK WAS DONE TO WANDER ACROSS THE MARSHES TAKING WITH HIM HIS BOW AND ARROWS AND OFTEN BRINGING HOME A WILD DUCK OR TWO WHICH HE SHOT IN THE POOLS
BUT NONE WHO HAVE EVER BOUGHT HIS BOWS HAVE REGRETTED THE SILVER WHICH THEY COST MANY AND MANY A GROSS OF ARROWHEADS HAVE I SOLD HIM
WERE GENERALLY STIRRED UP TO PUT DOWN THE ILL DOERS SOMETIMES THESE HUNTS WERE CONDUCTED IN A WHOLESALE WAY AND THE WHOLE POSSE OF A COUNTY WOULD BE CALLED OUT THEN ALL FOUND WITHIN ITS LIMITS
THE LIGHTS CAME OUT BRIGHTLY FROM MANY OF THE CASEMENTS WITH SOUNDS OF BOISTEROUS SONGS AND LAUGHTER THE WOMAN PASSED THESE WITHOUT A PAUSE PRESENTLY SHE STOPPED BEFORE A COTTAGE FROM WHICH A FEEBLE LIGHT ALONE SHOWED THAT IT WAS TENANTED SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
WHAT A JOY IT WILL BE TO HER TO SEE YOU AGAIN SO SAYING GILES LED THE WAY TO THE APARTMENT ABOVE THERE WAS A SCREAM OF SURPRISE AND JOY FROM HIS WIFE AND THEN GILES QUIETLY WITHDREW DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN
I HAVE PASSED THEM THE WOMAN SAID BUT ALL SEEMED FULL OF ROISTERERS I AM WET AND WEARY AND MY STRENGTH IS NIGH SPENT I CAN PAY THEE GOOD FELLOW AND I PRAY YOU AS A CHRISTIAN TO LET ME COME IN AND SLEEP BEFORE YOUR FIRE FOR THE NIGHT
THAT GEOFFREY WARD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE NEEDED TO PUT OUT ALL HIS SKILL TO HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIS PUPIL BUT IT WAS NOT ALONE WITH GEOFFREY THAT WALTER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING THE USE OF ARMS WHENEVER A SOLDIER RETURNED FROM THE WARS
WHAT IS IT HE ASKED I AM A WAYFARER THE WOMAN ANSWERED FEEBLY CANST TAKE ME AND MY CHILD IN FOR THE NIGHT
HE WAS A TALL AND POWERFUL MAN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDSOME HAD NOT HIS EYES BEEN TOO CLOSELY SET TOGETHER HIS NOSE WAS NARROW AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE REMINDED WALTER OF A HAWK
OF HIS HISTORY NOT ENCOURAGING HIM TO HOPE TO RECOVER HIS FATHER'S LANDS AND MINE FOR THAT CAN NEVER BE SEEING THAT BEFORE THAT TIME CAN COME THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ENJOYED FOR MANY YEARS BY OTHERS BUT THAT HE MAY LEARN TO BEAR HIMSELF BRAVELY
THAT DID HE TAKE LESS PAINS HE WOULD THRIVE MORE BUT HE HANDLES EACH BOW THAT HE MAKES AS IF HE LOVED IT AND FINISHES AND POLISHES EACH WITH HIS OWN HAND THEREFORE HE DOETH NOT SO MUCH TRADE AS THOSE WHO ARE LESS PARTICULAR WITH THEIR WARES
THAT NO BOY NOT YET APPRENTICED TO A TRADE
AND THAT BERTHA WOULD SERVE HER AS GLADLY AND FAITHFULLY AS EVER SHE DID WHEN SHE WAS HER NURSE YET SHE COULD NOT BUT GREATLY FEEL THE CHANGE SHE WAS TENDERLY BROUGHT UP BEING AS I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF SIR HAROLD BROOME
WHEN THEY FOUND THE COUNTRY BECOMING TOO HOT FOR THEM THESE MEN WOULD TAKE SERVICE WITH SOME KNIGHT OR NOBLE GOING TO THE WAR ANXIOUS TO TAKE WITH HIM AS STRONG A FOLLOWING AS MIGHT BE AND NOT TOO PARTICULAR AS TO THE CHARACTER OF HIS SOLDIERS
I THANK YOU INDEED SHE SAID FOR YOUR KINDNESS HAD YOU NOT TAKEN ME IN I THINK I WOULD HAVE DIED AT YOUR DOOR FOR INDEED I COULD GO NO FURTHER AND THOUGH I HOLD NOT TO LIFE YET WOULD I FAIN LIVE UNTIL I HAVE DELIVERED MY BOY
THAT MATTER DID NOT TROUBLE ME I KNEW BETTER THAN TO BRING MONEY INTO THIS SWAMP OF YOURS WHEN I MIGHT BE ATTACKED BY HALF A DOZEN RUFFIANS LIKE YOURSELF
HE HAD PARTICULARLY NOTICED HIM BECAUSE OF THE ARROGANT MANNER IN WHICH HE SPOKE WALTER HAD HIMSELF PUT IN THE RIVETS AND HAD THOUGHT AS HE BUCKLED ON THE ARMOUR AGAIN HOW UNPLEASANT A COUNTENANCE WAS THAT OF ITS WEARER
IN VAIN HIS FOLLOWERS ATTEMPTED TO COME TO HIS RESCUE EACH TIME THEY STRUGGLED UP THE HEAP THEY WERE BEATEN BACK AGAIN BY THOSE ON THE CREST
HE SAID SUDDENLY AS A SOB FROM THE FIGURE BY HIS SIDE
AT ANY RATE WHETHER HE FOLLOWS YOUR TRADE
HEAVY BLOWS WERE EXCHANGED AND BLOOD FLOWED FREELY FROM MANY OF THEIR HEADS AND FACES FOR IN THOSE DAYS BOYS THOUGHT LESS THAN THEY DO NOW OF HARD KNOCKS AND MANLINESS AND COURAGE WERE CONSIDERED THE FIRST OF VIRTUES
THAT WALTER WONDERED WHAT BUSINESS THERE MIGHT BE SCARCELY KNOWING WHY HE DID SO WALTER THREW HIMSELF DOWN AMONG SOME LOW BRUSHWOOD AND WATCHED THE APPROACHING FIGURE WHEN HE CAME NEAR
YOU COULD WISH FOR NOTHING BETTER THAN TO RIDE BEHIND THE PRINCE OF WALES HE IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS
FOR THE LIGHT IS WANING FAST IT WERE ILL FOR ANYONE I CAUGHT PRYING ABOUT HERE BUT COME IN SIR KNIGHT MY HOVEL IS NOT WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP IS ACCUSTOMED TO BUT WE MAY AS WELL TALK THERE AS HERE BENEATH THE SKY THE TWO MEN DISAPPEARED FROM WALTER'S SIGHT THE LATTER
THE TIDE WAS RUNNING DOWN STRONGLY
OF ITALY AND THE LOW COUNTRIES WHILE FROM ABOVE THE GRAIN NEEDED FOR THE WANTS OF THE GREAT CITY WAS FLOATED DOWN IN BARGES FROM THE WEST
URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD CEASE HE SAID AUTHORITATIVELY
AND BARING THEIR HEADS STOOD STILL IN CONFUSION NO HARM IS DONE THE PRINCE SAID
HITHERTO THE LADS ABSORBED IN THEIR STRIFE HAD PAID BUT LITTLE HEED TO THE PARTY OF ONLOOKERS BUT AT THE WORD
AND TWO OF THE PARTY TAKING OARS THEY STARTED UP THE RIVER NOW I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE BENT ON WALTER SAID FROM SOME WORDS I OVERHEARD
TEACH HIM TO BE HONEST AND TRUE IT WERE BETTER METHINKS THAT HE GREW UP THINKING YOU HIS FATHER AND MOTHER FOR OTHERWISE HE MAY GROW DISCONTENTED WITH HIS LOT
THE MARSHES SEARCHED FROM END TO END AND ALL FOUND THERE SHOULD BE KNOCKED ON HEAD AND THROWN INTO THEIR OWN DITCHES THERE WOULD BE NO FEAR OF ANY HONEST MAN COMING TO HIS END THEREBY BUT NOW TO BED LAD
THE HOUR IS LATE AND I SHALL BE HAVING THE WATCH COMING ALONG TO KNOW WHY I KEEP A FIRE SO LONG AFTER THE CURFEW SHOULD YOU BE A STRANGER IN THE CITY
ON SUNDAYS WALTER ALWAYS SPENT THE DAY WITH GILES FLETCHER AND HIS WIFE GOING TO MASS WITH THEM AND WALKING IN THE FIELDS WHERE
HER BROTHER WHO BUT A YEAR AGO BECAME LORD OF BROOMECASTLE AT THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THE QUEEN'S MEN AND IT WAS HE I BELIEVE WHO BROUGHT SIR ROLAND SOMERS TO THAT SIDE HE WAS SLAIN ON THE SAME NIGHT AS MORTIMER
FOR NONE WOULD SUSPECT THAT THERE WAS A HUMAN HABITATION AMONG THESE BROWN DITCHES AND STAGNANT POOLS TO HIS DISAPPOINTMENT THE LAD COULD HEAR NOTHING OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH WAS GOING ON WITHIN THE HUT THE MURMUR OF VOICES CAME TO HIS EAR BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE
YOU MAY BE SURE THE KNIGHT REPLIED
SEEING THAT HER KIND ENTERTAINERS WOULD BE HURT BY THE OFFER OF MONEY THE LADY CONTENTED HERSELF WITH THANKING MADGE WARMLY
OF DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF THOSE WHO RIDE WITH HIM MAY BE CERTAIN OF A CHANCE OF DOING VALOROUS DEEDS I WILL GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE TOMORROW AND WILL HAVE A TALK WITH MASTER FLETCHER THE SOONER YOU ARE APPRENTICED
THE RUMOURS THAT WE ARE LIKELY ERE LONG TO HAVE WAR WITH FRANCE HAVE RARELY BETTERED MY TRADE SINCE THE WARS IN SCOTLAND MEN'S ARMS HAVE RUSTED SOMEWHAT
THEY WERE CONTENT TO LEAVE HIM ALONE ONE DAY
SEE THE BLOOD IS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE ONE WOULD SCARCELY EXPECT TO SEE THESE VARLETS OF THE CITY PLAYING SO ROUGHLY THE CITIZENS HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES STURDY FIGHTERS BEFORE NOW MY PRINCE THE OTHER SAID THEY ARE EVER INDEPENDENT AND HOLD TO THEIR RIGHTS EVEN AGAINST THE KING
GILES HAD CAUSED HIM TO BE TAUGHT TO READ AND WRITE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WHICH WERE COMMON AMONG THE CITIZENS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE UNTIL LONG AFTERWARDS RARE AMONG THE WARLIKE BARONS THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME HOWEVER
LIKING BETTER TO HANG ABOUT TAVERNS DRINKING AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY RELATED FABULOUS TALES OF THE GALLANT ACTIONS THEY HAD PERFORMED MANY TOO WANDERED OVER THE COUNTRY SOMETIMES IN TWOS OR THREES SOMETIMES IN LARGE BANDS
BUT HIS FOLLOWERS WAVER
LOOKED ROUND AS HIS VISITOR ENTERED THE SHOP AND THEN WITH A SUDDEN EXCLAMATION LOWERED THE BOW HUSH GILES THE LADY EXCLAIMED IT IS I BUT NAME NO NAMES IT WERE BEST THAT NONE KNEW ME HERE
IT IS ASSUREDLY NO BUSINESS OF MINE BUT IT MAY LEAD TO AN ADVENTURE AND I HAVE HAD NO REAL FUN SINCE I LEFT ALDGATE I WILL FOLLOW
AS TO ARCHERY HE NEED NOT GO FAR TO LEARN IT SINCE YOUR APPRENTICE WILL PARKER LAST YEAR WON THE PRIZE AS THE BEST MARKSMAN IN THE CITY BOUNDS TRUST ME
BIDDING HIM IN CASE I CAME NOT BACK TO SET A HUE AND CRY ON FOOT
SHE WAS LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH WET AND HARDSHIP AND DOUBTLESS THEY TOOK ALL THE MORE EFFECT BECAUSE SHE WAS LOW IN SPIRIT AND WEAKENED WITH MUCH GRIEVING THAT NIGHT SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SORT OF FEVER HOT AND COLD BY TURNS AND AT TIMES OFF HER HEAD
THEY WILL DOUBTLESS BE CONFERRED UPON THOSE WHO HAVE AIDED THE YOUNG KING IN FREEING HIMSELF FROM HIS MOTHER'S DOMINATION FOR WHICH INDEED ALTHOUGH I LAMENT THAT LADY ALICE SHOULD HAVE SUFFERED SO SORELY IN THE DOING OF IT I BLAME HIM NOT AT ALL
THAT HE RAPIDLY ACQUIRED THEIR USE AND GEOFFREY FORESAW THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY SHOULD HIS THOUGHTS TURN THAT WAY PROVE A MIGHTY MAN AT ARMS
SINCE SEARCHERS COULD BE SEEN APPROACHING A LONG WAY OFF AND ESCAPE COULD BE MADE BY PATHS ACROSS THE SWAMP
THE TOWER WAS BUT HALF A MILE DISTANT BUT BEFORE MASTER ROGER ARRIVED WALTER HAD ALREADY RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS
AS SOON AS THE BOY COULD HANDLE A LIGHT TOOL GEOFFREY ALLOWED HIM TO WORK AND ALTHOUGH NOT ABLE TO WIELD THE HEAVY SLEDGE WALTER WAS ABLE TO DO MUCH OF THE FINER WORK
WHAT IS THY NAME GOOD LAD THE PRINCE ASKED I AM KNOWN AS WALTER FLETCHER YOU ARE A BRAVE LAD THE PRINCE SAID AND IF YOU BEAR YOU AS WELL AS A MAN AS YOU DID BUT NOW
AND THE FIRE MUST BE ALIGHT AT DAYBREAK ON HIS WAY BACK
ARE THIS EVENING GOING TO MAKE AN ATTACK UPON A BOAT WITH A LADY IN IT COMING DOWN THE RIVER WE WILL BE ON THE SPOT
AND INDEED NOT A FEW WERE THE COMPLAINTS WHICH WERE BROUGHT BEFORE GILES FLETCHER OF BRUISES AND HURTS CAUSED BY HIM YOU ARE TOO TURBULENT WALTER THE BOWYER SAID ONE DAY WHEN A HABERDASHER FROM THE WARD OF ALDERSGATE CAME TO COMPLAIN
TO ENTER UPON THE CAREER OF ARMS AND SO PERHAPS SOMEDAY TO WIN HIS WAY BACK TO RANK AND HONOURS THAN COULD HAVE BEEN LOOKED FOR THEREFORE ON THE FOLLOWING WEEK WALTER WAS INDENTURED TO THE ARMOURER AND AS WAS USUAL AT THE TIME
TRULY HE IS WELL AND STURDY THE MOTHER SAID LOOKING AT HIM PROUDLY INDEED I HAVE BEEN ALMOST WISHING TODAY THAT HE WERE LIGHTER BY A FEW POUNDS
WALTER SAW A FIGURE APPEAR ABOVE SOME BUSHES SOME FOUR HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT THE KNIGHT AT ONCE DIRECTED HIS STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION AND WALTER CREPT CAUTIOUSLY AFTER HIM A PEST UPON THESE SWAMPS AND QUAGMIRES THE KNIGHT SAID ANGRILY AS HE NEARED THE OTHER
FOR GREAT TRACTS OF FORESTS STILL COVERED A LARGE PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
MY FATHER IS TALKING OF APPRENTICING ME MASTER GEOFFREY WALTER SAID THAT EVENING I HOPE THAT YOU WILL AS YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO PROMISE TALK WITH HIM ABOUT APPRENTICING ME TO YOUR CRAFT RATHER THAN TO HIS I SHOULD NEVER TAKE TO THE MAKING OF BOWS
I HAD HEARD BUT VAGUELY OF YOUR TROUBLES GILES FLETCHER SAID BUT HOPED THAT THE RUMOURS WERE FALSE EVER SINCE THE DUKE OF KENT WAS EXECUTED THE AIR HAS BEEN FULL OF RUMOURS THEN CAME NEWS OF THE KILLING OF MORTIMER AND OF THE IMPRISONMENT OF THE KING'S MOTHER
SHE FEEBLY MADE HER WAY INTO THE VILLAGE
SHE LEANT AGAINST THE WALL WITH A FAINT GROAN OF EXHAUSTION AND DISAPPOINTMENT
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY COME FROM A DISTANCE
THE LAWS IN THOSE DAYS WERE EXTREMELY SEVERE AND DEATH WAS THE PENALTY OF THOSE CAUGHT PLUNDERING THE EXTREME SEVERITY OF THE LAWS HOWEVER OPERATED IN FAVOUR OF ITS BREAKERS
THE WOMAN DRANK THE STEAMING BEVERAGE WHICH HER HOST BROUGHT WITH HIM
HE SAW A FIGURE MAKING HIS WAY ACROSS THE HOUR WAS ALREADY LATE AND THE NIGHT WAS FALLING AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE MAN WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE USUAL DENIZENS OF THE SWAMP
THAT MEN WHO HAVE DONE NO OTHER HARM SHOULD BE BEHEADED STILL LESS THAT THEIR HEADS AND LIMBS SHOULD BE STUCK UP THERE GIBBERING AT ALL PASSERS BY THERE ARE OVER A SCORE OF THEM AND EVERY FRESH TROUBLE ADDS TO THEIR NUMBER BUT PARDON ME
HE IS A NOBLE PRINCE AND WILL MAKE US A GREAT KING AND THE DOINGS OF HIS MOTHER HAVE BEEN A SHAME TO US ALL HOWEVER I MEDDLE NOT IN POLITICS IF THE POOR LADY DIES AS METHINKS IS WELL NIGH CERTAIN BERTHA AND I WILL BRING UP THE BOY AS OUR OWN
DID IT NOT STRIKE YOU SIR KNIGHT THAT IT MIGHT ENTER MY MIND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY ADVISABLE FOR ME TO FREE MYSELF FROM ONE WHO STANDS TOWARDS ME IN THAT RELATION
THEY ROWED BY TURNS ALL WERE FAIRLY EXPERT AT THE EXERCISE FOR IN THOSE DAYS THE THAMES WAS AT ONCE THE GREAT HIGHWAY AND PLAYGROUND OF LONDON
ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS
REVENGE ON HIS CURSED HEAD NOR DID MY HATE LONG CONFINE ITSELF TO USELESS WISHES I BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE BEST MEANS OF SECURING HIM AND FOR THIS PURPOSE
AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE
BUT THE HORROR OF OTHERS APPEARED ONLY AS A MOCKERY A SHADOW OF THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED ME I ESCAPED FROM THEM
WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED MY NARRATION I SAID THIS IS THE BEING WHOM I ACCUSE AND FOR WHOSE SEIZURE AND PUNISHMENT I CALL UPON YOU TO EXERT YOUR WHOLE POWER
HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE
THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFUL SCREAM IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED AS I HEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THE MOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED
I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTE IN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED AROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND
THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS
AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THE SOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BY ITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS
DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIR CAUSE I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE
AND THIS PURPOSE QUIETED MY AGONY AND FOR AN INTERVAL RECONCILED ME TO LIFE I NOW RELATED MY HISTORY BRIEFLY BUT WITH FIRMNESS AND PRECISION MARKING THE DATES WITH ACCURACY
BUT NOTHING COULD APPEAR TO ME AS IT HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE A FIEND HAD SNATCHED FROM ME EVERY HOPE OF FUTURE HAPPINESS NO CREATURE HAD EVER BEEN SO MISERABLE AS I WAS SO FRIGHTFUL AN EVENT IS SINGLE IN THE HISTORY OF MAN
THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLY OF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAINING FRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND
UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT
AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW
AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN
WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP
IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER
BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS TALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITH DIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH
HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE
I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU
AFTER HAVING LANDED THEY PROCEEDED TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY PARTIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AMONG THE WOODS AND VINES I ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND PROCEEDED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE
HOWEVER WONDERFUL FORCES CONVICTION THE STORY IS TOO CONNECTED TO BE MISTAKEN FOR A DREAM AND I HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR FALSEHOOD
THERE WERE NO HORSES TO BE PROCURED AND I MUST RETURN BY THE LAKE BUT THE WIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS
WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DAEMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL
AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DAEMON
I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
AND DESIRED AND ARDENTLY PRAYED THAT I MIGHT HAVE HIM WITHIN MY GRASP TO WREAK A GREAT
AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THAT I HAD LOST AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND I HUNG OVER IT
ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LAST OVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIR ACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE
AND NEVER DEVIATING INTO INVECTIVE OR EXCLAMATION THE MAGISTRATE APPEARED AT FIRST PERFECTLY INCREDULOUS BUT AS I CONTINUED HE BECAME MORE ATTENTIVE AND INTERESTED
THE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DAEMON WHOM I HAD SENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION I WAS POSSESSED BY A MADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THE SHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN
THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED
THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD TRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS THIS STATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN
HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
SOMETIMES INDEED I DREAMT THAT I WANDERED
HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETH'S VOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BY A TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD COME
SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO
I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HIS FIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE
GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE
OH WHEN WILL MY GUIDING SPIRIT IN CONDUCTING ME TO THE DAEMON ALLOW ME THE REST I SO MUCH DESIRE OR MUST I DIE AND HE YET LIVE IF I DO
THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE CONFLICT UNTIL MY OWN LIFE OR THAT OF MY ADVERSARY WAS EXTINGUISHED ELIZABETH OBSERVED MY AGITATION FOR SOME TIME IN TIMID AND FEARFUL SILENCE
WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP
MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED
AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR
NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WE RETURNED HOPELESS
AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THE DESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLE AUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER
SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE
BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MY VIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIED HARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED
AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
WHO CAN FOLLOW AN ANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERE NO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE
AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP
MY FATHER EVEN NOW MIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HIS FEET THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION
MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MY WIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE POSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER
AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
I SHOULD GUESS THAT I HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTION OF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OF DESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES
AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
AND IF HE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOIS AND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOT CREDIT MY NARRATIVE
AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR
GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
HOWEVER IT WAS HARDLY MORNING AND I MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO ARRIVE BY NIGHT
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY
AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS
AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
SINCE THE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HE HAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT
BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOU EVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TO HAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE
FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
BUT THE TRUTH SLOWLY FORCED ITSELF UPON ME I WAS LOOKING UPON ARIZONA FROM THE SAME LEDGE FROM WHICH TEN YEARS BEFORE I HAD GAZED WITH LONGING UPON MARS BURYING MY HEAD IN MY ARMS I TURNED
WHICH IS EVER OLDEST YET EVER NEW I LOVED DEJAH THORIS THE TOUCH OF MY ARM UPON HER NAKED SHOULDER HAD SPOKEN TO ME IN WORDS I WOULD NOT MISTAKE
BUT NONE RESEMBLING THE DESCRIPTION WHICH KANTOS KAN HAD GIVEN ME OF HELIUM
NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROUD CLAIM OF THE THARKS TO ABSOLUTE VERITY DEJAH THORIS LAUGHED I KNEW THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU BECAME A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY YOU WOULD NOT CEASE TO BE MY FRIEND A WARRIOR MAY CHANGE HIS METAL BUT NOT HIS HEART AS THE SAYING IS UPON BARSOOM
DARK SMOOTH FACED ATHLETIC MAN WHOM I CALLED UNCLE JACK HE SEEMED ALWAYS TO BE LAUGHING
AND HAD THE CHOICE BEEN LEFT TO ME I COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A MORE FITTING MATE FOR THE FIRST PRINCESS OF BARSOOM HERE IS MY HAND UPON YOUR SHOULDER JOHN CARTER AND MY WORD
GRADUALLY I LEFT MY PURSUERS FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND AND I WAS JUST CONGRATULATING MYSELF ON MY LUCKY ESCAPE
LOOKING UP INTO THE HEAVENS AT WHAT I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I READ HIS MANUSCRIPT YEARS AFTERWARD HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD BEEN PROSPECTING AND MINING IN ARIZONA PART OF THE TIME SINCE THE WAR
DAY HAD NOW GIVEN AWAY TO NIGHT AND AS WE WANDERED ALONG THE GREAT AVENUE LIGHTED BY THE TWO MOONS OF BARSOOM AND WITH EARTH LOOKING DOWN UPON US OUT OF HER LUMINOUS GREEN EYE IT SEEMED THAT WE WERE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE AND I AT LEAST
I DOVE DOWN INTO THE STREETS OF THE CITY FAR BELOW THE PLANE USUALLY OCCUPIED BY THE AIR PATROL IN LESS THAN A MINUTE I WAS SETTLING SAFELY UPON THE ROOF OF OUR APARTMENT BESIDE THE ASTONISHED KANTOS KAN
AS I TOUCHED THE CORD THE SKELETONS SWUNG TO THE MOTION WITH A NOISE AS OF THE RUSTLING OF DRY LEAVES IT WAS A MOST GROTESQUE AND HORRID TABLEAU AND I HASTENED OUT INTO THE FRESH AIR GLAD TO ESCAPE FROM SO GRUESOME A PLACE
WAS CONTENT THAT IT SHOULD BE SO THE CHILL OF THE MARTIAN NIGHT WAS UPON US AND REMOVING MY SILKS I THREW THEM ACROSS THE SHOULDERS OF DEJAH THORIS AS MY ARM RESTED FOR AN INSTANT UPON HER I FELT A THRILL PASS THROUGH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING
A MOMENT BEFORE AND SO I CONTINUED TO IMPORTUNE HER TO ENLIGHTEN ME NO SHE EXCLAIMED IT IS ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE SAID IT AND THAT I HAVE LISTENED AND WHEN YOU LEARN JOHN CARTER AND IF I BE DEAD
WHICH FAIRLY FORMED A PERFECT LADDER FOR ME ALL THE WAY TO THE EAVES OF THE BUILDING HERE I MET MY FIRST REAL OBSTACLE THE EAVES PROJECTED NEARLY TWENTY FEET FROM THE WALL TO WHICH I CLUNG AND THOUGH I ENCIRCLED THE GREAT BUILDING I COULD FIND NO OPENING THROUGH THEM
THEY WERE DEALT A TERRIFIC BLOW BETWEEN THE EARS WITH THE BUTT OF A PISTOL AND IF THEY SHOWED FIGHT THIS TREATMENT WAS CONTINUED UNTIL THE BRUTES EITHER WERE SUBDUED OR HAD UNSEATED THEIR RIDERS
AT THE ARIZONA CAVE IT WAS DARK WHEN I OPENED MY EYES AGAIN STRANGE STIFF GARMENTS WERE UPON MY BODY
THAN LIVE ON EARTH ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF TERRIBLE MILES FROM HER THE OLD MINE WHICH I FOUND UNTOUCHED HAS MADE ME FABULOUSLY WEALTHY BUT WHAT CARE I FOR WEALTH
THE TOP FLOOR WAS ALIGHT AND FILLED WITH SOLDIERS ENGAGED IN THE PASTIMES OF THEIR KIND
THAT SHE SHARED MY SENTIMENTS IN THIS RESPECT I WAS POSITIVE FOR ON MY APPROACH THE LOOK OF PITIFUL HOPELESSNESS LEFT HER SWEET COUNTENANCE TO BE REPLACED BY A SMILE OF JOYFUL WELCOME
A MOMENT THEN RAISED IT WITH AN AIR OF CONFIDENCE I ONLY NEED TO PASS THESE GUARDS AND I CAN DO IT HE SAID AT LAST
FOR TO BE CAUGHT ON THE OPEN PLAINS WITH A CAVALCADE OF CHARIOTS AND CHILDREN WAS FAR FROM THE DESIRE OF EVEN SO WARLIKE A PEOPLE AS THE GREEN MARTIANS DURING OUR PERIOD OF INACTIVITY
AND LATER BY A SWIFT CRUISER CARRYING A HUNDRED MEN AND A BATTERY OF RAPID FIRE GUNS
ASKED TARS TARKAS ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD SEEN ME RUN MY ARM FAR BETWEEN THE GREAT JAWS OF ONE OF MY THOATS WHICH HAD WEDGED A PIECE OF STONE BETWEEN TWO OF HIS TEETH WHILE FEEDING UPON THE MOSS LIKE VEGETATION WITHIN OUR COURT YARD
SHOW ME HOW YOU ACCOMPLISH THESE RESULTS WAS TARS TARKAS ONLY REJOINDER AND SO I EXPLAINED AS CAREFULLY AS I COULD THE ENTIRE METHOD OF TRAINING I HAD ADOPTED WITH MY BEASTS AND LATER HE HAD ME REPEAT IT BEFORE LORQUAS PTOMEL AND THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS
THEY KNOW THAT I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TEN THOUSAND JEDDAKS THAT I TRACE MY ANCESTRY STRAIGHT BACK WITHOUT A BREAK TO THE BUILDER OF THE FIRST GREAT WATERWAY
IN FACT HE WOULD NOT TALK OF THEM AT ALL HE REMAINED WITH US FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND THEN WENT TO NEW YORK WHERE HE PURCHASED A LITTLE PLACE ON THE HUDSON WHERE I VISITED HIM ONCE A YEAR ON THE OCCASIONS OF MY TRIPS TO THE NEW YORK MARKET
SHE MUST HAVE LOST HER MIND TO HAVE ASSENTED TO SUCH AN ATROCIOUS BARGAIN YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW WE OF HELIUM LOVE THE MEMBERS OF OUR RULING HOUSE CANNOT APPRECIATE THE HORROR WITH WHICH I CONTEMPLATE SUCH AN UNHOLY ALLIANCE
OR DID HER BEAUTIFUL BODY LIE COLD IN DEATH BESIDE THE TINY GOLDEN INCUBATOR IN THE SUNKEN GARDEN
THAT SHOULD YOU ACCIDENTALLY WOUND AN ENEMY YOU WOULD TAKE HIM HOME AND NURSE HIM BACK TO HEALTH SHE LAUGHED THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT WE DO ON EARTH I ANSWERED AT LEAST AMONG CIVILIZED MEN THIS MADE HER LAUGH AGAIN
OR THE SPEED AT WHICH I WAS TRAVELING MY CHANCES FOR FINDING IT WERE SLIM HELIUM LIES A THOUSAND MILES SOUTHWEST OF ZODANGA AND WITH MY COMPASS INTACT I SHOULD HAVE MADE THE TRIP
BEFORE ME WAS A SMALL PATCH OF MOONLIT SKY WHICH SHOWED THROUGH A RAGGED APERTURE AS MY HANDS PASSED OVER MY BODY THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH POCKETS AND IN ONE OF THESE A SMALL PARCEL OF MATCHES WRAPPED IN OILED PAPER
I HAVE SEEN HIM FROM MY WINDOW STANDING IN THE MOONLIGHT ON THE BRINK OF THE BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE HUDSON WITH HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT TO THE HEAVENS AS THOUGH IN APPEAL I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS PRAYING
WHICH HE PREVIOUSLY HAD HAD CONSTRUCTED AND WHICH AS I LATER LEARNED
FOR DEJAH THORIS AND FOR YOU THIS VERY NIGHT I SHALL TRY TO REACH HIS QUARTERS IN THE PALACE HOW I ASKED YOU ARE STRONGLY GUARDED AND A QUADRUPLE FORCE PATROLS THE SKY HE BENT HIS HEAD IN THOUGHT
LOST IN THE SKY WITHOUT EFFORT AT CONCEALMENT I HASTENED TO THE VICINITY OF OUR QUARTERS
THE BUILDING WAS AN ENORMOUS ONE REARING ITS LOFTY HEAD FULLY A THOUSAND FEET INTO THE AIR BUT FEW BUILDINGS IN ZODANGA WERE HIGHER THAN THESE BARRACKS THOUGH SEVERAL TOPPED IT BY A FEW HUNDRED FEET
AS WE NEARED THE HIGH TOWER A PATROL SHOT DOWN FROM ABOVE
I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE SURPRISE OF MY LIFE BUT I DID NOT KNOW AT THAT TIME NOR FOR MANY MONTHS THEREAFTER YES I STILL HAD MUCH TO LEARN UPON BARSOOM I PRESUME IT IS THE BETTER PART OF WISDOM THAT WE BOW TO OUR FATE WITH AS GOOD GRACE AS POSSIBLE DEJAH THORIS
I MANAGED TO ELUDE THEIR SEARCH LIGHTS MOST OF THE TIME BUT I WAS ALSO LOSING GROUND BY THESE TACTICS AND SO I DECIDED TO HAZARD EVERYTHING ON A STRAIGHT AWAY COURSE AND LEAVE THE RESULT TO FATE AND THE SPEED OF MY MACHINE
I ASKED FEELING THE HOT BLOOD OF MY FIGHTING ANCESTORS LEAP IN MY VEINS AS I AWAITED HER REPLY ONLY IN LITTLE WAYS JOHN CARTER SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THAT CAN HARM ME OUTSIDE MY PRIDE
I ASKED THERE IS USUALLY BUT ONE MAN ON DUTY THERE AT NIGHT UPON THE ROOF GO TO THE ROOF OF THIS BUILDING KANTOS KAN AND WAIT ME THERE
I WAS EVER A GOOD HAND WITH ANIMALS AND BY INCLINATION AS WELL AS BECAUSE IT BROUGHT MORE LASTING AND SATISFACTORY RESULTS I WAS ALWAYS KIND AND HUMANE IN MY DEALINGS WITH THE LOWER ORDERS
AS I GAINED MY FEET I WAS CONFRONTED BY THE SENTRY ON DUTY INTO THE MUZZLE OF WHOSE REVOLVER I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING WHO ARE YOU AND WHENCE CAME YOU HE CRIED
ONLY A FEW DAYS SINCE YOU YOURSELF TOLD ME THAT THESE GREAT BRUTES BY THE UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR TEMPERS OFTEN WERE THE MEANS OF TURNING VICTORY INTO DEFEAT SINCE AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT THEY MIGHT ELECT TO UNSEAT AND REND THEIR RIDERS
WHEN HE CAME UPON IT IT LAY HE SAID STRETCHED FULL LENGTH IN THE SNOW WITH THE ARMS OUTSTRETCHED ABOVE THE HEAD TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE BLUFF AND WHEN HE SHOWED ME THE SPOT IT FLASHED UPON ME THAT IT WAS THE IDENTICAL ONE
AND GAZED UPON ME WITH DILATED EYES AND QUICKENING BREATH
ANKLET OF GOLD FROM HIS OWN LEG AS A SIGN OF HIS APPRECIATION OF MY SERVICE TO THE HORDE ON THE SEVENTH DAY FOLLOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE AIR CRAFT WE AGAIN TOOK UP THE MARCH TOWARD THARK ALL PROBABILITY OF ANOTHER ATTACK BEING DEEMED REMOTE
QUICK EXPLAIN YOURSELF OR I CALL THE GUARD LOOK YOU HERE SENTRY AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW I CAME
FOR AS HE LEANED TO PEER OVER THE EAVES I GRASPED HIM BY HIS THROAT AND HIS PISTOL ARM AND THREW HIM HEAVILY TO THE ROOF THE WEAPON DROPPED FROM HIS GRASP AND MY FINGERS CHOKED OFF HIS ATTEMPTED CRY FOR ASSISTANCE I GAGGED AND BOUND HIM
I FELL UPON IT BY CHANCE ONE DAY AS I WAS PASSING ABOVE THE PALACE ON PATROL DUTY IN THIS WORK IT IS REQUIRED THAT WE INVESTIGATE ANY UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE WE MAY WITNESS AND A FACE PEERING FROM THE PINNACLE OF THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE WAS TO ME MOST
LEFT ALONE IN THE STUDY I OPENED THE SAFE AND WITHDREW THE CONTENTS OF THE DRAWER IN WHICH HE HAD TOLD ME I WOULD FIND MY INSTRUCTIONS THEY WERE IN PART PECULIAR INDEED
AND THEREFORE MY FIGHTING EFFICIENCY IS ENHANCED AND I AM A BETTER WARRIOR FOR THE REASON THAT I AM A KIND MASTER YOUR OTHER WARRIORS WOULD FIND IT TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THEMSELVES AS WELL AS OF THE COMMUNITY TO ADOPT MY METHODS IN THIS RESPECT
I FELT MYSELF OVER FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND FROM HEAD TO FOOT I WAS CLOTHED
AND HE ENTERED INTO THE SPORTS OF THE CHILDREN WITH THE SAME HEARTY GOOD FELLOWSHIP HE DISPLAYED TOWARD THOSE PASTIMES IN WHICH THE MEN AND WOMEN OF HIS OWN AGE INDULGED
AND THEN HUNG HIM OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF AS I MYSELF HAD HUNG A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE I KNEW IT WOULD BE MORNING BEFORE HE WOULD BE DISCOVERED AND I NEEDED ALL THE TIME THAT I COULD GAIN DONNING MY TRAPPINGS AND WEAPONS
BUT I HOPE NEVERTHELESS THAT I MAY BE PRESENT THE NEXT TIME THAT ANY MARTIAN GREEN RED PINK OR VIOLET HAS THE TEMERITY TO EVEN SO MUCH AS FROWN ON YOU MY PRINCESS
FAR BELOW ME LAY THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED STREETS THE HARD PAVEMENTS AND DEATH THERE WAS A LITTLE JERK AT THE TOP OF THE SUPPORTING EAVES
THE DOCKS OF THE GREAT BATTLESHIPS OF THE LINE STANDING SOME FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET FROM THE GROUND WHILE THE FREIGHT AND PASSENGER STATIONS OF THE MERCHANT SQUADRONS ROSE NEARLY AS HIGH IT WAS A LONG CLIMB UP THE FACE OF THE BUILDING AND ONE FRAUGHT WITH MUCH DANGER BUT
UNSEEN THE UPPER STORY WHERE OUR APARTMENTS WERE SITUATED WAS THROUGH AN ADJOINING BUILDING AND AFTER CONSIDERABLE MANEUVERING I MANAGED TO ATTAIN THE ROOF OF A SHOP SEVERAL DOORS AWAY LEAPING FROM ROOF TO ROOF
WHERE I HAD SEEN HIM ON THOSE OTHER NIGHTS WITH HIS ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION TO THE SKIES THERE WERE NO MARKS OF VIOLENCE ON THE BODY AND WITH THE AID OF A LOCAL PHYSICIAN THE CORONER'S JURY QUICKLY REACHED A DECISION OF DEATH FROM HEART FAILURE
I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP US APART SHE CONTINUED FOR WHENEVER YOU HAVE BEEN OFF DUTY ONE OF THE OLDER WOMEN OF TARS TARKAS RETINUE HAS ALWAYS ARRANGED TO TRUMP UP SOME EXCUSE TO GET SOLA AND ME OUT OF SIGHT
THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY AND SO I ESSAYED THE TASK THE FACT THAT BARSOOMIAN ARCHITECTURE IS EXTREMELY ORNATE MADE THE FEAT MUCH SIMPLER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED SINCE I FOUND ORNAMENTAL LEDGES AND PROJECTIONS
AND THEN I FOUND TO MY CONSTERNATION THAT A FRAGMENT OF THE PROJECTILE HAD UTTERLY DESTROYED MY ONLY GUIDE AS WELL AS MY SPEEDOMETER IT WAS TRUE I COULD FOLLOW THE STARS IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF HELIUM BUT WITHOUT KNOWING THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE CITY
IF SUCCESSFUL HE WAS THEN TO FOLLOW ME HE SET MY COMPASS FOR ME A CLEVER LITTLE DEVICE WHICH WILL REMAIN STEADFASTLY FIXED UPON ANY GIVEN POINT ON THE SURFACE OF BARSOOM AND BIDDING EACH OTHER FAREWELL WE ROSE TOGETHER
LOVE MAKING ON MARS FOLLOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE AIR SHIPS THE COMMUNITY REMAINED WITHIN THE CITY FOR SEVERAL DAYS ABANDONING THE HOMEWARD MARCH UNTIL THEY COULD FEEL REASONABLY ASSURED THAT THE SHIPS WOULD NOT RETURN
WILD LIFE IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD WE ALL LOVED HIM AND OUR SLAVES FAIRLY WORSHIPPED THE GROUND HE TROD HE WAS A SPLENDID SPECIMEN OF MANHOOD STANDING A GOOD TWO INCHES OVER SIX FEET BROAD OF SHOULDER AND NARROW OF HIP
EVEN IN SECRECY IF NECESSARY HIS PROPERTY WAS LEFT IN SUCH A WAY THAT I WAS TO RECEIVE THE ENTIRE INCOME FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHEN THE PRINCIPAL WAS TO BECOME MINE
THERE WAS ONE SLIGHT DESPERATE CHANCE AND THAT I DECIDED I MUST TAKE IT WAS FOR DEJAH THORIS AND NO MAN HAS LIVED WHO WOULD NOT RISK A THOUSAND DEATHS FOR SUCH AS SHE CLINGING TO THE WALL WITH MY FEET
AND MUMMIFIED REMAINS OF A LITTLE OLD WOMAN WITH LONG BLACK HAIR AND THE THING IT LEANED OVER WAS A SMALL CHARCOAL BURNER UPON WHICH RESTED A ROUND COPPER VESSEL CONTAINING A SMALL QUANTITY OF GREENISH POWDER
AS IT TURNED OUT HOWEVER MORNING FOUND ME SPEEDING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF DEAD SEA BOTTOM AFTER NEARLY SIX HOURS OF CONTINUOUS FLIGHT AT HIGH SPEED PRESENTLY A GREAT CITY SHOWED BELOW ME BUT IT WAS NOT HELIUM
SOME DAY YOU SHALL KNOW JOHN CARTER IF WE LIVE BUT I MAY NOT TELL YOU AND I
FILLED HIM WITH DISMAY IT CANNOT BE HE EXCLAIMED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WHY NO MAN IN ALL HELIUM BUT WOULD PREFER DEATH TO THE SELLING OF OUR LOVED PRINCESS TO THE RULING HOUSE OF ZODANGA
TARS TARKAS HAD INSTRUCTED ME IN MANY OF THE CUSTOMS AND ARTS OF WAR FAMILIAR TO THE THARKS INCLUDING LESSONS IN RIDING AND GUIDING THE GREAT BEASTS WHICH BORE THE WARRIORS THESE CREATURES WHICH ARE KNOWN AS THOATS ARE AS DANGEROUS AND VICIOUS AS THEIR MASTERS BUT WHEN ONCE SUBDUED
I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF OBSERVING A REGIMENT OF AS TRACTABLE AND DOCILE MOUNTS AS ONE MIGHT CARE TO SEE THE EFFECT ON THE PRECISION AND CELERITY OF THE MILITARY MOVEMENTS WAS SO REMARKABLE THAT LORQUAS PTOMEL PRESENTED ME WITH A MASSIVE
I CAN SOLVE THE DIFFICULTY IN SO FAR AS HELIUM IS CONCERNED BUT FOR PERSONAL REASONS I WOULD PREFER THAT ANOTHER STRUCK THE BLOW THAT FREES DEJAH THORIS KANTOS KAN EYED ME NARROWLY BEFORE HE SPOKE
FOR EVEN THOUGH WE DIE AT THEIR HANDS WE CAN AFFORD THEM PITY SINCE WE ARE GREATER THAN THEY AND THEY KNOW IT
THE SILVERED MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE THE ALMOST STATIONARY MOON HANGING IN THE SKY THE CACTI STUDDED VALLEY BELOW ME WERE NOT OF MARS
I OBSERVED HE WAS MUCH OCCUPIED IN WRITING I PRESUME NOW UPON THIS MANUSCRIPT HE TOLD ME AT THIS TIME THAT IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HIM HE WISHED ME TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIS ESTATE
WITH THE CARRIAGE OF THE TRAINED FIGHTING MAN HIS FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND CLEAR CUT HIS HAIR BLACK AND CLOSELY CROPPED WHILE HIS EYES WERE OF A STEEL GRAY REFLECTING A STRONG AND LOYAL CHARACTER FILLED WITH FIRE
HIS FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS RELATED TO THIS MANUSCRIPT WHICH I WAS TO RETAIN SEALED AND UNREAD JUST AS I FOUND IT FOR ELEVEN YEARS NOR WAS I TO DIVULGE ITS CONTENTS UNTIL TWENTY ONE YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH
IN SUBMITTING CAPTAIN CARTER'S STRANGE MANUSCRIPT TO YOU IN BOOK FORM I BELIEVE THAT A FEW WORDS RELATIVE TO THIS REMARKABLE PERSONALITY WILL BE OF INTEREST MY FIRST RECOLLECTION OF CAPTAIN CARTER IS OF THE FEW MONTHS
THE CONCUSSION NEARLY CAPSIZED HER AND WITH A SICKENING PLUNGE SHE HURTLED DOWNWARD THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT
AS SHE PLACED HER LITTLE RIGHT HAND UPON MY LEFT SHOULDER IN TRUE RED MARTIAN SALUTE SARKOJA TOLD SOLA THAT YOU HAD BECOME A TRUE THARK SHE SAID
I ANSWERED TURNING TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE ROOF WHERE TWENTY FEET BELOW AT THE END OF MY STRAP HUNG ALL MY WEAPONS THE FELLOW ACTING ON IMPULSE OF CURIOSITY STEPPED TO MY SIDE AND TO HIS UNDOING
WHICH BROUGHT ROGUISH DIMPLES TO THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND CRIED WHAT A CHILD A GREAT WARRIOR AND YET A STUMBLING LITTLE CHILD WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW I ASKED IN SORE PERPLEXITY
EVEN IN THAT COUNTRY OF MAGNIFICENT HORSEMEN I HAVE OFTEN HEARD MY FATHER CAUTION HIM AGAINST HIS WILD RECKLESSNESS BUT HE WOULD ONLY LAUGH AND SAY THAT THE TUMBLE THAT KILLED HIM WOULD BE FROM THE BACK OF A HORSE YET UNFOALED
TWO OF THESE ANIMALS HAD FALLEN TO ME FROM THE WARRIORS WHOSE METAL I WORE AND IN A SHORT TIME I COULD HANDLE THEM QUITE AS WELL AS THE NATIVE WARRIORS THE METHOD WAS NOT AT ALL COMPLICATED
SHE SOLILOQUIZED IN CONCLUSION THEN SHE BROKE OUT AGAIN INTO ONE OF HER GAY HAPPY LAUGHING MOODS JOKING WITH ME ON MY PROWESS AS A THARK WARRIOR AS CONTRASTED WITH MY SOFT HEART AND NATURAL KINDLINESS I PRESUME
THE WATCHMAN RELATED THE FEW DETAILS CONNECTED WITH THE FINDING OF THE BODY
AND WEST I TURNED BACK IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION
MY EXPERIENCE WITH WOOLA DETERMINED ME TO ATTEMPT THE EXPERIMENT OF KINDNESS IN MY TREATMENT OF MY THOATS FIRST I TAUGHT THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT UNSEAT ME AND EVEN RAPPED THEM SHARPLY BETWEEN THE EARS TO IMPRESS UPON THEM MY AUTHORITY AND MASTERY
AND SO I HASTENED TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMAND I ARRIVED AT THE LITTLE STATION ABOUT A MILE FROM HIS GROUNDS ON THE MORNING OF MARCH FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX
ONE OF THESE MATCHES I STRUCK AND ITS DIM FLAME LIGHTED UP WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HUGE CAVE TOWARD THE BACK OF WHICH I DISCOVERED A STRANGE STILL FIGURE HUDDLED OVER A TINY BENCH AS I APPROACHED IT
BEHIND HER DEPENDING FROM THE ROOF UPON RAWHIDE THONGS AND STRETCHING ENTIRELY ACROSS THE CAVE WAS A ROW OF HUMAN SKELETONS FROM THE THONG WHICH HELD THEM STRETCHED ANOTHER TO THE DEAD HAND OF THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN
GENTLY I PULLED ON IT TO STRENGTHEN ITS HOLD BUT WHETHER IT WOULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF MY BODY I DID NOT KNOW IT MIGHT BE BARELY CAUGHT UPON THE VERY OUTER VERGE OF THE ROOF
DURING THE DAYS JUST PRECEDING OUR DEPARTURE I HAD SEEN BUT LITTLE OF DEJAH THORIS
SUCH AS CONTACT WITH NO OTHER MORTAL HAD EVEN PRODUCED AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE HAD LEANED SLIGHTLY TOWARD ME BUT OF THAT I WAS NOT SURE ONLY I KNEW THAT AS MY ARM RESTED THERE ACROSS HER SHOULDERS
UNUSUAL I THEREFORE DREW NEAR AND DISCOVERED THAT THE POSSESSOR OF THE PEERING FACE WAS NONE OTHER THAN SAB THAN HE WAS SLIGHTLY PUT OUT AT BEING DETECTED AND COMMANDED ME TO KEEP THE MATTER TO MYSELF EXPLAINING THAT THE PASSAGE FROM THE TOWER
SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT FOR WITH ALL HER TENDERNESS AND WOMANLY SWEETNESS SHE WAS STILL A MARTIAN AND TO A MARTIAN THE ONLY GOOD ENEMY IS A DEAD ENEMY FOR EVERY DEAD FOEMAN MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WHO LIVE
BY KINDNESS I REPLIED YOU SEE TARS TARKAS THE SOFTER SENTIMENTS HAVE THEIR VALUE EVEN TO A WARRIOR IN THE HEIGHT OF BATTLE AS WELL AS UPON THE MARCH I KNOW THAT MY THOATS WILL OBEY MY EVERY COMMAND
TELLING ME I WOULD FIND HIS WILL THERE AND SOME PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS WHICH HE HAD ME PLEDGE MYSELF TO CARRY OUT WITH ABSOLUTE FIDELITY AFTER I HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT
AS I NEARED THE BUILDING I BECAME MORE CAREFUL AS I JUDGED AND RIGHTLY THAT THE PLACE WOULD BE GUARDED SEVERAL MEN IN CIVILIAN METAL LOITERED NEAR THE FRONT ENTRANCE AND IN THE REAR WERE OTHERS MY ONLY MEANS OF REACHING
WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT HE LEFT US NOR DID I SEE HIM AGAIN FOR SOME FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS WHEN HE RETURNED IT WAS WITHOUT WARNING AND I WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO NOTE THAT HE HAD NOT AGED APPARENTLY A MOMENT
WHO REPRESENTED TO ME ALL THAT I HAD LEFT BEHIND UPON EARTH IN AGREEABLE AND CONGENIAL COMPANIONSHIP THERE SEEMED BONDS OF MUTUAL INTEREST BETWEEN US AS POWERFUL AS
I COULD TAKE A HUMAN LIFE IF NECESSARY WITH FAR LESS COMPUNCTION THAN THAT OF A POOR
THEIR BULLETS EXPLODE WHEN THEY STRIKE AN OBJECT WELL THE OPAQUE OUTER COATING IS BROKEN BY THE IMPACT EXPOSING A GLASS CYLINDER ALMOST SOLID IN THE FORWARD END OF WHICH IS A MINUTE PARTICLE OF RADIUM POWDER
AND A VOICE ROARED OUT A COMMAND TO HALT FOLLOWING WITH A SHOT AS I PAID NO ATTENTION TO HIS HAIL KANTOS KAN DROPPED QUICKLY INTO THE DARKNESS WHILE I ROSE STEADILY
I HASTENED TO THE SHEDS AND SOON HAD OUT BOTH MY MACHINE AND KANTOS KAN'S
AS I SIT HERE TONIGHT IN MY LITTLE STUDY OVERLOOKING THE HUDSON JUST TWENTY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE I FIRST OPENED MY EYES UPON MARS
THE JEDDAK OF HELIUM FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE WAITED AND PRAYED FOR AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTIONS FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE WAITED AND PRAYED TO BE TAKEN BACK TO THE WORLD OF MY LOST LOVE I WOULD RATHER LIE DEAD BESIDE HER THERE
LONGER THAN THE ACT OF ADJUSTING THE SILK REQUIRED SHE DID NOT DRAW AWAY NOR DID SHE SPEAK AND SO IN SILENCE WE WALKED THE SURFACE OF A DYING WORLD BUT IN THE BREAST OF ONE OF US AT LEAST HAD BEEN BORN THAT
THE MOMENT THE SUNLIGHT EVEN THOUGH DIFFUSED STRIKES THIS POWDER IT EXPLODES WITH A VIOLENCE WHICH NOTHING CAN WITHSTAND IF YOU EVER WITNESS A NIGHT BATTLE YOU WILL NOTE THE ABSENCE OF THESE EXPLOSIONS
I SOON REACHED AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE BUILDING WHERE I HOPED TO FIND THE HELIUMITE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT I STOOD IN THE ROOM BEFORE HIM HE WAS ALONE AND SHOWED NO SURPRISE AT MY COMING SAYING HE HAD EXPECTED ME MUCH EARLIER
AND THAT I SMILED IT WAS ALL GREEK TO ME BUT THE MORE I BEGGED HER TO EXPLAIN THE MORE POSITIVE BECAME HER DENIALS OF MY REQUEST AND SO IN VERY HOPELESSNESS I DESISTED
THE SIGHT THAT MET MY EYES AS I STEPPED OUT UPON A SMALL LEDGE WHICH RAN BEFORE THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE FILLED ME WITH CONSTERNATION A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW LANDSCAPE MET MY GAZE
I AM AN AIR SCOUT FRIEND AND VERY NEAR A DEAD ONE FOR JUST BY THE MEREST CHANCE I ESCAPED FALLING TO THE AVENUE BELOW I REPLIED BUT HOW CAME YOU UPON THE ROOF MAN NO ONE HAS LANDED OR COME UP FROM THE BUILDING FOR THE PAST HOUR
AND TONIGHT SHE SEEMS CALLING TO ME AGAIN AS SHE HAS NOT CALLED BEFORE SINCE THAT LONG DEAD NIGHT AND I THINK I CAN SEE ACROSS THAT AWFUL ABYSS OF SPACE A BEAUTIFUL BLACK HAIRED WOMAN STANDING IN THE GARDEN OF A PALACE AND AT HER SIDE IS A LITTLE BOY WHO PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HER
IF I WAS A FRIEND OF THE CAPTAIN'S HE HAD SOME VERY BAD NEWS FOR ME THE CAPTAIN HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD SHORTLY AFTER DAYLIGHT THAT VERY MORNING BY THE WATCHMAN ATTACHED TO AN ADJOINING PROPERTY FOR SOME REASON THIS NEWS DID NOT SURPRISE ME BUT
AND INITIATIVE HIS MANNERS WERE PERFECT AND HIS COURTLINESS WAS THAT OF A TYPICAL SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN OF THE HIGHEST TYPE HIS HORSEMANSHIP ESPECIALLY AFTER HOUNDS WAS A MARVEL AND DELIGHT
I HAD WARNED THEM AGAINST VENTURING FAR FROM THE PLAZA FOR FEAR OF THE GREAT WHITE APES WHOSE FEROCITY I WAS ONLY TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HOWEVER SINCE WOOLA ACCOMPANIED THEM ON ALL THEIR EXCURSIONS AND AS SOLA WAS WELL ARMED
THOUGH UPON SOME OTHER BEAST IF NOT HIS TORN AND MANGLED BODY WAS GATHERED UP BY HIS WOMEN AND BURNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THARKIAN CUSTOM
AND BY MEANS OF WHICH LANDING PARTIES ARE LOWERED TO THE GROUND FROM THE BATTLESHIPS I SWUNG THIS HOOK CAUTIOUSLY
GRATING SOUND WHICH TURNED ME COLD WITH APPREHENSION THEN THE HOOK CAUGHT AND I WAS SAFE CLAMBERING QUICKLY ALOFT I GRASPED THE EDGE OF THE EAVES AND DREW MYSELF TO THE SURFACE OF THE ROOF ABOVE
AS MY TOUR OF DUTY MUST HAVE ENDED SOME TIME SINCE I SAW THAT HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AT THE PALACE AND WHEN I HAD ENLIGHTENED HIM HE WAS ALL EXCITEMENT THE NEWS THAT DEJAH THORIS HAD PROMISED HER HAND TO SAB THAN
LET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE US
AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
AND ALL SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH DEAL ONLY WITH THESE ARE NAIVETES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX
THEY WILL SAY THEIR HONESTY' THAT IS THEIR DEVILRY AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MATTER AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT HAVE NOT ALL GODS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH SANCTIFIED
OUR GOOD ARISTOTLE SAYS SHE HAS DEFINED IT CONCISELY IN HIS PHYSICS AND CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH HOW PRAY SAID I
OUR VIRTUES IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO HAVE STILL OUR VIRTUES ALTHOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT THOSE SINCERE AND MASSIVE VIRTUES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN ESTEEM
INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
AND WHO THE OTHER IS FOR INSTANCE IN A PERSON CREATED AND DESTINED FOR COMMAND SELF DENIAL AND MODEST RETIREMENT INSTEAD OF BEING VIRTUES WOULD BE THE WASTE OF VIRTUES
HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
IN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARP
THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
THESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US
I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
MORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LAST
IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
DID HE PERHAPS DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT WHEN HE THUS EXHORTED SYSTEMS OF MORALS TO PRACTISE MORALITY BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH IN THE RIGHT
NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
WHO COULD GIVE THIS POPULAR ASTONISHMENT A SEDUCTIVE AND MYSTICAL OTHER WORLDLY EXPRESSION PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THE HIGHER NATURE BY EXPERIENCE INSTEAD OF STATING
BUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MEN
IS MORALIZING NOT IMMORAL IN THE END THEY ALL WANT ENGLISH MORALITY TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AUTHORITATIVE INASMUCH AS MANKIND OR THE GENERAL UTILITY
THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
SO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES
HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
BUT THE MEETING AND CONCURRENCE OF THESE CAUSES ARISES FROM THAT INEVITABLE CHAIN OF ORDER WHICH FLOWING FROM THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF PROVIDENCE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN THEIR DUE TIME AND PLACE
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS IN THE STELLAR FIRMAMENT THERE ARE SOMETIMES TWO SUNS WHICH DETERMINE THE PATH OF ONE PLANET
THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
APPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINED
AS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYED
WE ARE PREPARED AS NO OTHER AGE HAS EVER BEEN FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE FOR THE MOST SPIRITUAL FESTIVAL LAUGHTER AND ARROGANCE FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHT OF SUPREME FOLLY
SO IT IS SYMPATHY AGAINST SYMPATHY BUT TO REPEAT IT ONCE MORE THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN THE PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND SYMPATHY
THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
ALTHOUGH THEY USED IT OF MATERIAL SUBSTANCE NOT OF THE EFFICIENT PRINCIPLE THIS THEY LAID DOWN AS A KIND OF BASIS FOR ALL THEIR REASONINGS CONCERNING NATURE NOW
OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
THE FACT THEREBY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER PART OF WHAT INTERESTS AND CHARMS HIGHER NATURES AND MORE REFINED AND FASTIDIOUS TASTES SEEMS ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING TO THE AVERAGE MAN IF
IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
WITH A SECRET CONFIDENCE AND CORDIALITY WE ENJOY IT AS A REFINEMENT OF ART RESERVED EXPRESSLY FOR US AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE AS LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE REPULSIVE FUMES AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE
THE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURING
WHO STRIVE AFTER POWER THEY CALL IT FREEDOM OUR SYMPATHY IS A LOFTIER AND FURTHER SIGHTED SYMPATHY WE SEE HOW MAN DWARFS HIMSELF HOW YOU DWARF HIM
EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
EX NIHILO FOR IT HAS ITS PROPER CAUSES THE UNFORESEEN AND UNEXPECTED CONCURRENCE OF WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE CHANCE ABOUT FOR HAD NOT THE CULTIVATOR BEEN DIGGING
WITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOST
NOW WITH RED LIGHT NOW WITH GREEN
BY COINCIDENCE THAT ONE DUG WHERE THE OTHER BURIED THE TREASURE WE MAY THEN DEFINE CHANCE AS BEING AN UNEXPECTED RESULT FLOWING FROM A CONCURRENCE OF CAUSES WHERE THE SEVERAL FACTORS HAD SOME DEFINITE END
FOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERS
SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL
WHAT PLACE CAN BE LEFT FOR RANDOM ACTION WHEN GOD CONSTRAINETH ALL THINGS TO ORDER FOR EX NIHILO NIHIL IS SOUND DOCTRINE WHICH NONE OF THE ANCIENTS GAINSAID
WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
IS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICE
FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
THE HISTORICAL SENSE OR THE CAPACITY FOR DIVINING QUICKLY THE ORDER OF RANK OF THE VALUATIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH A PEOPLE A COMMUNITY OR AN INDIVIDUAL HAS LIVED
LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
BUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALS
TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIAN
A DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTY
AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVE
THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEAS
INDEED AT TIMES THE HIGHER AND SUBLIMER THING TAKES PLACE WE LEARN TO DESPISE WHEN WE LOVE AND PRECISELY WHEN WE LOVE BEST ALL OF IT HOWEVER UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT NOISE
DEEP AND WIDE ALL THE FLOTSAM COMES TOGETHER THAT IS BORNE UPON THE TIDE SHIPS AND TRUNKS OF TREES UPROOTED IN THE TORRENT'S WILD CAREER MEET AS MID THE SWIRLING WATERS
OUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LEST
AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
GRADATIONS OF RANK IN THE WORLD EVEN AMONG THINGS AND NOT ONLY AMONG MEN
JUST AS THOUGH IN SHORT THEY BETRAY SOMETHING THEREBY FLAUBERT FOR INSTANCE
CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
JUST AS HE HAD ALREADY STALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RESPECTABLE HELVETIUS NO HE WAS NOT A DANGEROUS MAN HELVETIUS C E SENATEUR POCOCURANTE TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF GALIANI
AS ITS SIXTH SENSE OWING TO THIS MINGLING THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND MODE OF LIFE AND OF CULTURES WHICH WERE FORMERLY CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS AND SUPERIMPOSED ON ONE ANOTHER FLOWS FORTH INTO US
AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
SO IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY SYSTEM OF UNEGOISTIC MORALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF UNCONDITIONALLY AND APPEALS TO EVERY ONE NOT ONLY SINS AGAINST GOOD TASTE
PRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDS
OR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THE
IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
CHAPTER SEVEN OUR VIRTUES
AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
AND TENDER YES IT IS WELL PROTECTED FROM CLUMSY SPECTATORS AND FAMILIAR CURIOSITY WE ARE WOVEN INTO A STRONG NET AND GARMENT OF DUTIES AND CANNOT DISENGAGE OURSELVES
HAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS
AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
AND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES
THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
HAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTY
IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
IS PRECISELY THE PERFECTION AND ULTIMATE MATURITY IN EVERY CULTURE AND ART THE ESSENTIALLY NOBLE IN WORKS AND MEN THEIR MOMENT OF SMOOTH SEA AND HALCYON SELF SUFFICIENCY
SHE CEASED AND WAS ABOUT TO PASS ON IN HER DISCOURSE TO THE EXPOSITION OF OTHER MATTERS WHEN I BREAK IN AND SAY EXCELLENT IS THINE EXHORTATION AND SUCH AS WELL BESEEMETH THY HIGH AUTHORITY
AND MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION DESIRABLE THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING OF GREAT SUFFERING KNOW YE NOT THAT IT IS ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE THAT HAS PRODUCED ALL THE ELEVATIONS OF HUMANITY HITHERTO
AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SO
MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
AT ALL AND IF SO WHAT IT IS THEN SHE MADE ANSWER I AM ANXIOUS TO FULFIL MY PROMISE COMPLETELY AND OPEN TO THEE A WAY OF RETURN TO THY NATIVE LAND
NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
THE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN
THE DIVINING INSTINCT FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE VALUATIONS FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSE
HAD NOT THE MAN WHO HID THE MONEY BURIED IT IN THAT PRECISE SPOT THE GOLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THESE THEN ARE THE REASONS WHY THE FIND IS A CHANCE ONE IN THAT IT RESULTS FROM CAUSES WHICH MET TOGETHER AND CONCURRED
I MEAN AFTER COMFORT AND FASHION
SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
HAD PRESERVED AN UNDEFACED ENERGY WITH THE TEMPER OF BUCCANEERS AND THE EYES OF DREAMERS THEY APPEARED TO LIVE IN A CRAZY MAZE OF PLANS HOPES DANGERS ENTERPRISES AHEAD OF CIVILISATION IN THE DARK PLACES OF THE SEA
HE SEEMED CALM ENOUGH ONLY HE STUMBLED SEVERAL TIMES AND ONCE AS I STOOD SPEAKING TO HIM HE WALKED RIGHT INTO ME AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STONE BLIND HE MADE NO DEFINITE ANSWER TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL
I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN I AM I AM A GENTLEMAN TOO YES YES I SAID HASTILY HE WAS LOOKING ME SQUARELY IN THE FACE AND WITHDREW HIS GAZE SLOWLY
THE BIG FRAMEWORK OF PUNKAHS MOVED GENTLY TO AND FRO HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND FROM BELOW MANY EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF DARK FACES OUT OF WHITE FACES OUT OF RED FACES OUT OF FACES ATTENTIVE SPELLBOUND
AND THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY WAS BEING HELD IN THE POLICE COURT OF AN EASTERN PORT HE STOOD ELEVATED IN THE WITNESS BOX WITH BURNING CHEEKS IN A COOL LOFTY ROOM
WHO WANTED FACTS AFTER HIS FIRST FEELING OF REVOLT HE HAD COME ROUND TO THE VIEW THAT ONLY A METICULOUS PRECISION OF STATEMENT WOULD BRING OUT THE TRUE HORROR BEHIND THE APPALLING FACE OF THINGS
AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR A FELLOW IN MY POSITION TO BE BELIEVED MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO AN ELDER MAN IT IS SO DIFFICULT SO AWFULLY UNFAIR SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
HE KNEW THE MAGIC MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE BETWEEN SKY AND WATER HE HAD TO BEAR THE CRITICISM OF MEN THE EXACTIONS OF THE SEA AND THE PROSAIC SEVERITY OF THE DAILY TASK THAT GIVES BREAD BUT WHOSE ONLY REWARD IS IN THE PERFECT LOVE OF THE WORK
HELD ON HER STEADFAST WAY BLACK AND SMOULDERING IN A LUMINOUS IMMENSITY AS IF SCORCHED BY A FLAME FLICKED AT HER FROM A HEAVEN WITHOUT PITY
IT WAS AN ACT OF INTELLIGENT VOLITION JIM BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS FORGOT HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO FIND LEISURE FOR A THOUGHT THIS FELLOW RAN THE THOUGHT LOOKS AT ME AS THOUGH HE COULD SEE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING PAST MY SHOULDER
THERE ARE MANY SHADES IN THE DANGER OF ADVENTURES AND GALES AND IT IS ONLY NOW AND THEN THAT THERE APPEARS ON THE FACE OF FACTS A SINISTER VIOLENCE OF INTENTION THAT INDEFINABLE SOMETHING WHICH FORCES IT UPON THE MIND AND THE HEART OF A MAN
AND THEN THE UNINTELLIGENT BRUTALITY OF AN EXISTENCE LIABLE TO THE AGONY OF SUCH SENSATIONS FILLED HIM WITH A DESPAIRING DESIRE TO ESCAPE AT ANY COST THEN FINE WEATHER RETURNED AND HE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT
HE APPEARED CHANGED AS IF HE HAD SUDDENLY MATURED ONE COULDN'T BE SURE HE MUTTERED AH YOU WERE NOT SURE I SAID
BRUTALISED ALL THOSE HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF AND WORE A BLOOD AND IRON AIR COMBINED WITH A PURPLE NOSE AND A RED MOUSTACHE AFTER SHE HAD BEEN PAINTED OUTSIDE AND WHITEWASHED INSIDE EIGHT HUNDRED PILGRIMS MORE OR LESS
AS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING IN ORDERLY ROWS UPON NARROW BENCHES HAD BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE FASCINATION OF HIS VOICE IT WAS VERY LOUD IT RANG STARTLING IN HIS OWN EARS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE WORLD
FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I DIDN'T AFTER ALL DIDN'T GO OUT IN THAT WAY I WASN'T GOING TO BE FRIGHTENED AT WHAT I HAD DONE AND ANYHOW IF I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP I WOULD HAVE DONE MY BEST TO BE SAVED
FOR THE TERRIBLY DISTINCT QUESTIONS THAT EXTORTED HIS ANSWERS SEEMED TO SHAPE THEMSELVES IN ANGUISH AND PAIN WITHIN HIS BREAST CAME TO HIM POIGNANT AND SILENT
HEAVY PROD GETS HOME THE BOND IS FOUND TO BE CLOSE THAT BESIDES THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CRAFT THERE IS FELT THE STRENGTH OF A WIDER FEELING THE FEELING THAT BINDS A MAN TO A CHILD HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME BELIEVING THAT
NO THE PROPER THING WAS TO FACE IT OUT ALONE FOR MYSELF WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
KEEP UP THE ILLUSION OF MY BEGINNINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD ROBBED OUR COMMON LIFE OF THE LAST SPARK OF ITS GLAMOUR AND SO YOU CLEARED OUT AT ONCE JUMPED HE CORRECTED ME INCISIVELY JUMPED MIND
AND WHEN CLEAR OF CONFINING RAILS SPREAD ON ALL SIDES OVER THE DECK FLOWED FORWARD AND AFT OVERFLOWED DOWN THE YAWNING HATCHWAYS FILLED THE INNER RECESSES OF THE SHIP LIKE WATER FILLING A CISTERN
THE EDGE OF HIS TEMPER AND THE FIBRE OF HIS STUFF THAT REVEAL THE QUALITY OF HIS RESISTANCE AND THE SECRET TRUTH OF HIS PRETENCES NOT ONLY TO OTHERS BUT ALSO TO HIMSELF
ITS EYE OF FLAME AS IF IN DERISION OF HER ERRAND OF FAITH SHE CLEARED THE STRAIT CROSSED THE BAY CONTINUED ON HER WAY THROUGH THE ONE DEGREE PASSAGE SHE HELD ON STRAIGHT FOR THE RED SEA UNDER A SERENE SKY
HE REPEATED AND I WONDERED AT THE EVIDENT BUT OBSCURE INTENTION WELL YES PERHAPS I COULD NOT SEE THEN BUT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME AND ANY AMOUNT OF LIGHT IN THAT BOAT AND I COULD THINK TOO
THAT THIS COMPLICATION OF ACCIDENTS OR THESE ELEMENTAL FURIES ARE COMING AT HIM WITH A PURPOSE OF MALICE WITH A STRENGTH BEYOND CONTROL WITH AN UNBRIDLED CRUELTY THAT MEANS TO TEAR OUT OF HIM HIS HOPE AND HIS FEAR
STOP THE ENGINES INSTEAD OF MAKING A ROW ABOUT IT ON DECK I HEARD HIM SAY GET UP RUN FLY HE SWORE ALSO THE ENGINEER SLID DOWN THE STARBOARD LADDER AND BOLTED ROUND THE SKYLIGHT TO THE ENGINE ROOM COMPANION
COMING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AND FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE EAST AFTER TREADING THE JUNGLE PATHS DESCENDING THE RIVERS COASTING IN PRAUS ALONG THE SHALLOWS CROSSING IN SMALL CANOES FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND PASSING THROUGH SUFFERING
HIS FINGERS PLAYED INCESSANTLY TOUCHING THE PAPER WITHOUT NOISE I DID NOT THINK OF DANGER JUST THEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STARTLED ALL THIS HAPPENED IN SUCH A QUIET WAY AND SO VERY SUDDENLY
LIGHTED BY FESTAL SUNSHINE ITS SHIPS LIKE TOYS ITS BRILLIANT ACTIVITY RESEMBLING A HOLIDAY PAGEANT WITH THE ETERNAL SERENITY OF THE EASTERN SKY OVERHEAD AND THE SMILING PEACE OF THE EASTERN SEAS
CHAPTER TWO AFTER TWO YEARS OF TRAINING HE WENT TO SEA AND ENTERING THE REGIONS SO WELL KNOWN TO HIS IMAGINATION FOUND THEM STRANGELY BARREN OF ADVENTURE HE MADE MANY VOYAGES
THE SOUND OF HIS OWN TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS CONFIRMED HIS DELIBERATE OPINION THAT SPEECH WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ANY LONGER THAT MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF HIS HOPELESS DIFFICULTY JIM LOOKED AT HIM THEN TURNED AWAY
THE AWNINGS COVERED THE DECK WITH A WHITE ROOF FROM STEM TO STERN AND A FAINT HUM A LOW MURMUR OF SAD VOICES ALONE REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF A CROWD OF PEOPLE UPON THE GREAT BLAZE OF THE OCEAN
SAID THE GERMAN SKIPPER TO HIS NEW CHIEF MATE AN ARAB THE LEADER OF THAT PIOUS VOYAGE CAME LAST HE WALKED SLOWLY ABOARD HANDSOME AND GRAVE IN HIS WHITE GOWN AND LARGE TURBAN A STRING OF SERVANTS FOLLOWED LOADED WITH HIS LUGGAGE
HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
THE MAGISTRATE HAD SWAYED FORWARD
I KNEW THERE WAS NO OTHER BULKHEAD IN THE SHIP BUT THE COLLISION BULKHEAD SEPARATING THE FOREPEAK FROM THE FOREHOLD I WENT BACK TO TELL THE CAPTAIN I CAME UPON THE SECOND ENGINEER GETTING UP AT THE FOOT OF THE BRIDGE LADDER HE SEEMED DAZED AND
SURELY IN NO OTHER CRAFT AS IN THAT OF THE SEA DO THE HEARTS OF THOSE ALREADY LAUNCHED TO SINK OR SWIM GO OUT SO MUCH TO THE YOUTH ON THE BRINK LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES UPON THAT
HARBOURED A SILENT LISTENER NOW AND THEN A SMALL RED GLOW WOULD MOVE ABRUPTLY AND EXPANDING LIGHT UP THE FINGERS OF A LANGUID HAND PART OF A FACE IN PROFOUND REPOSE OR FLASH A CRIMSON GLEAM INTO A PAIR OF PENSIVE EYES
RESTED UPON A WHITE MAN WHO SAT APART FROM THE OTHERS WITH HIS FACE WORN AND CLOUDED BUT WITH QUIET EYES THAT GLANCED STRAIGHT INTERESTED AND CLEAR JIM ANSWERED ANOTHER QUESTION AND WAS TEMPTED TO CRY OUT
TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIS LEFT ARM WAS BROKEN HE HAD SLIPPED ON THE TOP STEP WHEN GETTING DOWN WHILE I WAS FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED MY GOD THAT ROTTEN BULKHEAD'LL GIVE WAY IN A MINUTE
HAD REMAINED AS OFFICERS OF COUNTRY SHIPS THEY HAD NOW A HORROR OF THE HOME SERVICE WITH ITS HARDER CONDITIONS SEVERER VIEW OF DUTY AND THE HAZARD OF STORMY OCEANS THEY WERE ATTUNED TO THE ETERNAL PEACE OF EASTERN SKY AND SEA
PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
AT HIS BACK WAS THE DARK NIGHT WITH THE CLEAR STARS WHOSE DISTANT GLITTER DISPOSED IN RETREATING PLANES LURED THE EYE INTO THE DEPTHS OF A GREATER DARKNESS
AND HIS VOICE SPOKE I WAS SO LOST YOU KNOW IT WAS THE SORT OF THING ONE DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAPPEN TO ONE IT WAS NOT LIKE A FIGHT FOR INSTANCE
THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
HE LAY THERE BATTENED DOWN IN THE MIDST OF A SMALL DEVASTATION AND FELT SECRETLY GLAD HE HAD NOT TO GO ON DECK BUT NOW AND AGAIN AN UNCONTROLLABLE RUSH OF ANGUISH WOULD GRIP HIM BODILY
ENVELOPED IN A FULGOR OF SUNSHINE THAT KILLED ALL THOUGHT OPPRESSED THE HEART WITHERED ALL IMPULSES OF STRENGTH AND ENERGY AND UNDER THE SINISTER SPLENDOUR OF THAT SKY THE SEA BLUE AND PROFOUND REMAINED STILL WITHOUT A STIR
AND WAS PLACATED BY THE SOUND OF A FAINT SIGH THAT PASSED BETWEEN US LIKE THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD IN THE NIGHT WELL I WASN'T HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRETCHED STORY THEY MADE UP IT WAS NOT A LIE
LIKE THIS HE SAID IT DOES ME GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU DON'T WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE HE WAS A YOUNGSTER OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO SEE ABOUT YOU
THE FACTS THOSE MEN WERE SO EAGER TO KNOW HAD BEEN VISIBLE TANGIBLE OPEN TO THE SENSES OCCUPYING THEIR PLACE IN SPACE AND TIME REQUIRING FOR THEIR EXISTENCE A FOURTEEN HUNDRED TON STEAMER
PLAYED CARDS A LITTLE OR YAWNING AND IN PYJAMAS LOUNGED THROUGH THE DAY IN EASY CHAIRS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD THE HOSPITAL STOOD ON A HILL AND A GENTLE BREEZE ENTERING THROUGH THE WINDOWS ALWAYS FLUNG WIDE OPEN
NOBODY WOULD KNOW OF COURSE BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR ME YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT TOO I DID NOT WANT ALL THIS TALK NO YES I WON'T LIE
HE RESTED HIS TEMPLE IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE WIND OF THE PUNKAHS EDDIED DOWN ON THE HEADS ON THE DARK FACED NATIVES WOUND ABOUT IN VOLUMINOUS DRAPERIES ON THE EUROPEANS SITTING TOGETHER VERY HOT
IN NO OTHER KIND OF LIFE IS THE ILLUSION MORE WIDE OF REALITY IN NO OTHER IS THE BEGINNING ALL ILLUSION THE DISENCHANTMENT MORE SWIFT THE SUBJUGATION MORE COMPLETE
HE PRONOUNCED WITH A CONVULSIVE EFFORT WHOSE STRESS AS IF PROPAGATED BY THE WAVES OF THE AIR MADE MY BODY STIR A LITTLE IN THE CHAIR HE FIXED ME WITH LOWERING EYES DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME HE CRIED I SWEAR
HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE SHIP SHE WENT OVER WHATEVER IT WAS AS EASY AS A SNAKE CRAWLING OVER A STICK THE ILLUSTRATION WAS GOOD THE QUESTIONS WERE AIMING AT FACTS
WITHOUT A RIPPLE WITHOUT A WRINKLE VISCOUS STAGNANT DEAD THE PATNA WITH A SLIGHT HISS PASSED OVER THAT PLAIN LUMINOUS AND SMOOTH UNROLLED A BLACK RIBBON OF SMOKE ACROSS THE SKY
AND FORTUNATELY HE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO GO ON TALKING FOR TRUTH'S SAKE PERHAPS FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALSO AND WHILE HIS UTTERANCE WAS DELIBERATE HIS MIND POSITIVELY FLEW ROUND AND ROUND THE SERRIED CIRCLE OF FACTS
HIS VOICE SOUNDED REASONABLE SUPPOSE I HAD NOT I MEAN TO SAY SUPPOSE I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP WELL HOW MUCH LONGER SAY A MINUTE HALF A MINUTE
SUCH WERE THE DAYS STILL HOT HEAVY DISAPPEARING ONE BY ONE INTO THE PAST AS IF FALLING INTO AN ABYSS FOR EVER OPEN IN THE WAKE OF THE SHIP AND THE SHIP LONELY UNDER A WISP OF SMOKE
HE ASSOCIATED NATURALLY WITH THE MEN OF HIS CALLING IN THE PORT THESE WERE OF TWO KINDS SOME VERY FEW AND SEEN THERE BUT SELDOM LED MYSTERIOUS LIVES
OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO IMAGINE YOURSELF TO HAVE BEEN OF THE SORT WHOSE APPEARANCE CLAIMS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THESE ILLUSIONS YOU HAD THOUGHT GONE OUT EXTINCT COLD AND WHICH AS IF REKINDLED AT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER FLAME
GLIDED PAST ON HIS DESCENT AND SANK MYSTERIOUSLY INTO THE SEA EVENING AFTER EVENING PRESERVING THE SAME DISTANCE AHEAD OF HER ADVANCING BOWS THE FIVE WHITES ON BOARD LIVED AMIDSHIPS ISOLATED FROM THE HUMAN CARGO
THE STRONG MEN AT THE HEAD OF FAMILY PARTIES THE LEAN OLD MEN PRESSING FORWARD WITHOUT HOPE OF RETURN YOUNG BOYS WITH FEARLESS EYES GLANCING CURIOUSLY SHY LITTLE GIRLS WITH TUMBLED LONG HAIR
AND ON THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS THE STEAMER POUNDED IN THE DUSK THE CALM WATER OF THE STRAIT AND FAR ASTERN OF THE PILGRIM SHIP A SCREW PILE LIGHTHOUSE PLANTED BY UNBELIEVERS ON A TREACHEROUS SHOAL SEEMED TO WINK AT HER
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THIS WHAT'S THE GOOD HE TAPPED WITH HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY BIT HIS LIP AND LOOKED AWAY OVER THE HEADS HE MET THE EYES OF THE WHITE MAN THE GLANCE DIRECTED AT HIM WAS NOT THE FASCINATED STARE OF THE OTHERS
BROUGHT INTO THE BARE ROOM THE SOFTNESS OF THE SKY THE LANGUOR OF THE EARTH THE BEWITCHING BREATH OF THE EASTERN WATERS THERE WERE PERFUMES IN IT SUGGESTIONS OF INFINITE REPOSE THE GIFT OF ENDLESS DREAMS
DISABLED BY A FALLING SPAR AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK OF WHICH HIS SCOTTISH CAPTAIN USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS MAN IT'S A PAIRFECT MEERACLE TO ME HOW SHE LIVED THROUGH IT SPENT MANY DAYS STRETCHED ON HIS BACK DAZED BATTERED HOPELESS
AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FORESTS THEIR CLEARINGS THE PROTECTION OF THEIR RULERS THEIR PROSPERITY THEIR POVERTY THE SURROUNDINGS OF THEIR YOUTH AND THE GRAVES OF THEIR FATHERS THEY CAME COVERED WITH DUST WITH SWEAT WITH GRIME WITH RAGS
HADN'T WE ALL COMMENCED WITH THE SAME DESIRE ENDED WITH THE SAME KNOWLEDGE CARRIED THE MEMORY OF THE SAME CHERISHED GLAMOUR THROUGH THE SORDID DAYS OF IMPRECATION WHAT WONDER THAT WHEN SOME
SHE WAS OWNED BY A CHINAMAN CHARTERED BY AN ARAB AND COMMANDED BY A SORT OF RENEGADE NEW SOUTH WALES GERMAN VERY ANXIOUS TO CURSE PUBLICLY HIS NATIVE COUNTRY BUT WHO APPARENTLY ON THE STRENGTH OF BISMARCK'S VICTORIOUS POLICY
IN THEIR APPEARANCE OF DOING SO WELL ON SUCH A SMALL ALLOWANCE OF DANGER AND TOIL IN TIME BESIDE THE ORIGINAL DISDAIN THERE GREW UP SLOWLY ANOTHER SENTIMENT AND SUDDENLY GIVING UP THE IDEA OF GOING HOME
LIKE WATER FLOWING INTO CREVICES AND CRANNIES LIKE WATER RISING SILENTLY EVEN WITH THE RIM EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN WITH FAITH AND HOPES WITH AFFECTIONS AND MEMORIES THEY HAD COLLECTED THERE
I INTERJECTED I WOULD HAVE MEANT TO BE HE RETORTED AND THAT'S MORE THAN I MEANT WHEN I HE SHIVERED AS IF ABOUT TO SWALLOW SOME NAUSEOUS DRUG JUMPED
A HAIR'S BREADTH HE MUTTERED NOT THE BREADTH OF A HAIR BETWEEN THIS AND THAT AND AT THE TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE A HAIR AT MIDNIGHT I PUT IN
HIS LAMENESS HOWEVER PERSISTED AND WHEN THE SHIP ARRIVED AT AN EASTERN PORT HE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL HIS RECOVERY WAS SLOW AND HE WAS LEFT BEHIND
OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
HOW THIS ONE HAD AN EASY BILLET IN JAPAN SOMEWHERE AND THAT ONE WAS DOING WELL IN THE SIAMESE NAVY AND IN ALL THEY SAID IN THEIR ACTIONS IN THEIR LOOKS IN THEIR PERSONS COULD BE DETECTED THE SOFT SPOT THE PLACE OF DECAY
I WANTED IT IT IS THE VERY THING I WANTED THERE DO YOU THINK YOU OR ANYBODY COULD HAVE MADE ME IF I I AM I AM NOT AFRAID TO TELL AND I WASN'T AFRAID TO THINK EITHER I LOOKED IT IN THE FACE
A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
MEETING STRANGE SIGHTS BESET BY STRANGE FEARS UPHELD BY ONE DESIRE THEY CAME FROM SOLITARY HUTS IN THE WILDERNESS FROM POPULOUS CAMPONGS FROM VILLAGES BY THE SEA AT THE CALL OF AN IDEA
OUTSIDE THE COURT THE SUN BLAZED WITHIN WAS THE WIND OF GREAT PUNKAHS THAT MADE YOU SHIVER THE SHAME THAT MADE YOU BURN THE ATTENTIVE EYES WHOSE GLANCE STABBED THE FACE OF THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE
I WASN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY AT FIRST AT NIGHT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THOSE FELLOWS I MIGHT HAVE NO BY HEAVENS I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM THAT SATISFACTION THEY HAD DONE ENOUGH THEY MADE UP A STORY AND BELIEVED IT FOR ALL I KNOW
AND TORMENTED AS IF AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS OF UNREST HE DID NOT CARE WHAT THE END WOULD BE AND IN HIS LUCID MOMENTS OVERVALUED HIS INDIFFERENCE THE DANGER WHEN NOT SEEN HAS THE IMPERFECT VAGUENESS OF HUMAN THOUGHT
LOOKING AT JIM WITH THOUGHTFUL BLUE EYES THE OTHER A HEAVY SCORNFUL MAN THROWN BACK IN HIS SEAT HIS LEFT ARM EXTENDED FULL LENGTH DRUMMED DELICATELY WITH HIS FINGER TIPS ON A BLOTTING PAD IN THE MIDDLE THE MAGISTRATE
LIKE A PRISONER ALONE IN HIS CELL OR LIKE A WAYFARER LOST IN A WILDERNESS AT PRESENT HE WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT MATTER THOUGH THEY HAD A PURPOSE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER AGAIN SPEAK OUT AS LONG AS HE LIVED
CLEAN SHAVED AND IMPASSIBLE LOOKED AT HIM DEADLY PALE BETWEEN THE RED FACES OF THE TWO NAUTICAL ASSESSORS THE LIGHT OF A BROAD WINDOW UNDER THE CEILING FELL FROM ABOVE ON THE HEADS AND SHOULDERS OF THE THREE MEN
AS IF FACTS COULD EXPLAIN ANYTHING AFTER YOU HAD CONCLUDED YOU HAD COLLIDED WITH SOMETHING FLOATING AWASH SAY A WATER LOGGED WRECK YOU WERE ORDERED BY YOUR CAPTAIN TO GO FORWARD AND ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE DONE
BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIVE IT DOWN ALONE WITH MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IN TO SUCH A BEASTLY UNFAIR THING WHAT DID IT PROVE AFTER ALL I WAS CONFOUNDEDLY CUT UP SICK OF LIFE
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GREED OF ADVENTURES THAT ARE THEIR OWN AND ONLY REWARD WHAT WE GET WELL WE WON'T TALK OF THAT BUT CAN ONE OF US RESTRAIN A SMILE
HE DID NOT STRIKE HIM AGAIN HE STOOD BENDING OVER HIM AND SPEAKING ANGRILY BUT QUITE LOW
THE DETERMINATION TO LOUNGE SAFELY THROUGH EXISTENCE TO JIM THAT GOSSIPING CROWD VIEWED AS SEAMEN SEEMED AT FIRST MORE UNSUBSTANTIAL THAN SO MANY SHADOWS BUT AT LENGTH HE FOUND A FASCINATION IN THE SIGHT OF THOSE MEN
THE TIMID WOMEN MUFFLED UP AND CLASPING TO THEIR BREASTS WRAPPED IN LOOSE ENDS OF SOILED HEAD CLOTHS THEIR SLEEPING BABIES THE UNCONSCIOUS PILGRIMS OF AN EXACTING BELIEF
AND HE HAD BEEN DELIBERATING UPON DEATH CONFOUND HIM HE HAD FOUND THAT TO MEDITATE ABOUT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE WHILE ALL ITS GLAMOUR HAD GONE WITH THE SHIP IN THE NIGHT WHAT MORE NATURAL
AFFLICTED BY SOME MYSTERIOUS TROPICAL DISEASE WHO HELD THE DOCTOR FOR AN ASS AND INDULGED IN SECRET DEBAUCHERIES OF PATENT MEDICINE WHICH HIS TAMIL SERVANT USED TO SMUGGLE IN WITH UNWEARIED DEVOTION THEY TOLD EACH OTHER THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES
THE SUNSHINE THE MEMORIES THE FUTURE WHICH MEANS TO SWEEP THE WHOLE PRECIOUS WORLD UTTERLY AWAY FROM HIS SIGHT BY THE SIMPLE AND APPALLING ACT OF TAKING HIS LIFE JIM
I WAS TOLD TO CALL NO ONE AND TO MAKE NO NOISE FOR FEAR OF CREATING A PANIC I THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION REASONABLE I TOOK ONE OF THE LAMPS THAT WERE HUNG UNDER THE AWNINGS AND WENT FORWARD AFTER OPENING THE FOREPEAK HATCH I HEARD SPLASHING IN THERE
THEY STREAMED ABOARD OVER THREE GANGWAYS THEY STREAMED IN URGED BY FAITH AND THE HOPE OF PARADISE THEY STREAMED IN WITH A CONTINUOUS TRAMP AND SHUFFLE OF BARE FEET WITHOUT A WORD A MURMUR OR A LOOK BACK
HOW MUCH MORE DID YOU WANT I ASKED BUT I THINK I SPOKE SO LOW THAT HE DID NOT CATCH WHAT I SAID HE HAD ADVANCED HIS ARGUMENT AS THOUGH LIFE HAD BEEN A NETWORK OF
MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO FLOAT FOR HOURS IN THE OPEN SEA AND BE PICKED UP NOT MUCH THE WORSE FOR IT I MIGHT HAVE LASTED IT OUT BETTER THAN MANY OTHERS THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY HEART
JIM LOOKED EVERY DAY OVER THE THICKETS OF GARDENS BEYOND THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN OVER THE FRONDS OF PALMS GROWING ON THE SHORE AT THAT ROADSTEAD WHICH IS A THOROUGHFARE TO THE EAST AT THE ROADSTEAD DOTTED BY GARLANDED ISLETS
GLITTER OF THE VAST SURFACE WHICH IS ONLY A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN GLANCES FULL OF FIRE THERE IS SUCH MAGNIFICENT VAGUENESS IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAD DRIVEN EACH OF US TO SEA SUCH A GLORIOUS INDEFINITENESS
WHICH ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF HIS METAPHYSIC IN THE FIFTH THE ORDER OF THE PHYSICAL QUESTIONS WHICH HE HAS INVESTIGATED AND IN PARTICULAR THE EXPLICATION OF THE MOTION OF THE HEART AND OF SOME OTHER DIFFICULTIES PERTAINING TO MEDICINE
THERE ARE THICK SOFT CARPETS ON THE FLOORS THE DISHES ARE MADE OF SILVER AND THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK SPECIAL THINGS
AND THEY THINK THEY'RE GOOD HEARERS
WHILE HE WAS STANDING THERE WONDERING HOW THE MONKEYS WERE GETTING ON AND WHAT HIS GARDEN WOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN HE GOT BACK TO PUDDLEBY
FOR TO BE POSSESSED OF A VIGOROUS MIND IS NOT ENOUGH THE PRIME REQUISITE IS RIGHTLY TO APPLY IT THE GREATEST MINDS AS THEY ARE CAPABLE OF THE HIGHEST EXCELLENCES ARE OPEN LIKEWISE TO THE GREATEST ABERRATIONS
I HEAR THE NOISE OF SOME ONE PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET SAID THE OWL BUT THAT MAKES HARDLY ANY SOUND AT ALL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU COULDN'T HEAR THAT OUT HERE
AFTER A MOMENT TOO TOO SAID
AND I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER COMPETENTLY TO UNDERTAKE THEIR EXAMINATION THERE WAS NEED OF SOME SPECIAL HELP FROM HEAVEN AND OF BEING MORE THAN MAN
KEEP STILL CAN'T YOU OH SAID THE PIG IS THAT ALL I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING TO DRINK SO THE DOCTOR LEFT THE BOY TO PLAY WITH THE ANIMALS IN THE DINING ROOM
THAT PHILOSOPHY AFFORDS THE MEANS OF DISCOURSING WITH AN APPEARANCE OF TRUTH ON ALL MATTERS AND COMMANDS THE ADMIRATION OF THE MORE SIMPLE THAT JURISPRUDENCE MEDICINE AND THE OTHER SCIENCES SECURE FOR THEIR CULTIVATORS HONORS AND RICHES AND IN FINE
THE OCEAN GOSSIPS RIGHT AWAY AN AXE WAS FOUND AND THE DOCTOR SOON CHOPPED A HOLE IN THE DOOR BIG ENOUGH TO CLAMBER THROUGH AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL IT WAS SO DARK INSIDE SO HE STRUCK A MATCH
BUT SOLELY TO DESCRIBE THE WAY IN WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO CONDUCT MY OWN THEY WHO SET THEMSELVES TO GIVE PRECEPTS MUST OF COURSE REGARD THEMSELVES AS POSSESSED OF GREATER SKILL THAN THOSE TO WHOM THEY PRESCRIBE
AND THE ISSUE OF WHICH MUST PRESENTLY PUNISH HIM IF HE HAS JUDGED AMISS THAN IN THOSE CONDUCTED BY A MAN OF LETTERS IN HIS STUDY REGARDING SPECULATIVE MATTERS THAT ARE OF NO PRACTICAL MOMENT AND FOLLOWED BY NO CONSEQUENCES TO HIMSELF FARTHER PERHAPS
DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND MY UNCLE FOR ME WELL WE ARE GOING TO TRY VERY HARD SAID THE DOCTOR NOW WHAT WAS YOUR UNCLE LIKE TO LOOK AT HE HAD RED HAIR THE BOY ANSWERED VERY RED HAIR
IF SUCH WERE ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND I HAD BEEN TAUGHT ALL THAT OTHERS LEARNED THERE AND NOT CONTENTED WITH THE SCIENCES ACTUALLY TAUGHT US I HAD IN ADDITION READ ALL THE BOOKS THAT HAD FALLEN INTO MY HANDS
DOOR LOCKED AND WE ARE ALL CRAZY TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S INSIDE JIP SAYS IT MUST BE WHERE THE PIRATES KEPT THEIR TREASURE BUT WE
AND THE LITTLE BOY BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN WELL NOW WAIT A MINUTE SAID THE DOCTOR DON'T CRY LET'S GO AND HAVE TEA IN THE DINING ROOM AND WE'LL TALK IT OVER MAYBE YOUR UNCLE IS QUITE SAFE ALL THE TIME
THERE WILL BE FOUND PERHAPS AS MANY MORE WHICH IT WERE ADVISABLE NOT TO FOLLOW I HOPE IT WILL PROVE USEFUL TO SOME WITHOUT BEING HURTFUL TO ANY AND THAT MY OPENNESS WILL FIND SOME FAVOR WITH ALL
THIS IS DAB DAB ONE OF MY PETS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT DUCKS HAD A LANGUAGE SAID THE BOY ARE ALL THESE OTHER ANIMALS YOUR PETS TOO WHAT IS THAT STRANGE LOOKING THING WITH TWO HEADS
AND WHEN THEY HAD GONE INTO THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM AND WERE HAVING TEA DAB DAB CAME UP BEHIND THE DOCTOR'S CHAIR AND WHISPERED ASK THE PORPOISES IF THE BOY'S UNCLE WAS DROWNED THEY'LL KNOW ALL RIGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
FASTENED AT THE BOTTOM SO THEY WOULDN'T TUMBLE WITH THE ROLLING OF THE SHIP AND ABOVE THE BARRELS PEWTER JUGS OF ALL SIZES HUNG FROM WOODEN PEGS THERE WAS A STRONG WINEY SMELL AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SAT A LITTLE BOY
AND THAT'S SOMETHING PERHAPS WE CAN FIND HIM FOR YOU FIRST WE'LL GO AND HAVE TEA WITH STRAWBERRY JAM
IF READ WITH DISCRETION AID IN FORMING THE JUDGMENT THAT THE PERUSAL OF ALL EXCELLENT BOOKS IS AS IT WERE TO INTERVIEW WITH THE NOBLEST MEN OF PAST AGES WHO HAVE WRITTEN THEM AND EVEN A STUDIED INTERVIEW IN WHICH ARE DISCOVERED TO US
IF THE POOR FELLOW'S UNHAPPY WE'VE GOT TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD CRYING BITTERLY
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE AMONG THEM SOME WHO WERE ALREADY MARKED OUT TO FILL THE PLACES OF OUR INSTRUCTORS AND IN FINE OUR AGE APPEARED TO ME AS FLOURISHING AND AS FERTILE IN POWERFUL MINDS AS ANY PRECEDING ONE
OF GRADUALLY AUGMENTING MY KNOWLEDGE AND OF RAISING IT BY LITTLE AND LITTLE TO THE HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE MEDIOCRITY OF MY TALENTS AND THE BRIEF DURATION OF MY LIFE WILL PERMIT ME TO REACH FOR I HAVE ALREADY REAPED FROM IT SUCH FRUITS THAT
THE ANIMALS ALL WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT THEIR NEW BOAT WAS LIKE INSIDE WHILE THE DOCTOR LEANT ON THE RAIL AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH WATCHING THE CANARY ISLANDS FADE AWAY IN THE BLUE DUSK OF THE EVENING
IN MAKING SUCH REFLECTION ON THE MATTER OF MY EXPERIENCE AS TO SECURE MY IMPROVEMENT FOR IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD FIND MUCH MORE TRUTH IN THE REASONINGS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL WITH REFERENCE TO THE AFFAIRS IN WHICH HE IS PERSONALLY INTERESTED
BUT I SHALL ENDEAVOR IN THIS DISCOURSE TO DESCRIBE THE PATHS I HAVE FOLLOWED AND TO DELINEATE MY LIFE AS IN A PICTURE IN ORDER THAT EACH ONE MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO JUDGE OF THEM FOR HIMSELF AND THAT IN THE GENERAL OPINION ENTERTAINED OF THEM AS GATHERED FROM CURRENT REPORT
TO HOLD IN ESTEEM THE STUDIES OF THE SCHOOLS I WAS AWARE THAT THE LANGUAGES TAUGHT IN THEM ARE NECESSARY TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE GRACE OF FABLE STIRS THE MIND THAT THE MEMORABLE DEEDS OF HISTORY ELEVATE IT AND
AND IF THEY ERR IN THE SLIGHTEST PARTICULAR THEY SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO CENSURE BUT AS THIS TRACT IS PUT FORTH MERELY AS A HISTORY OR IF YOU WILL AS A TALE IN WHICH AMID SOME EXAMPLES WORTHY OF IMITATION
WHILE BUSIED ONLY IN CONSIDERING THE MANNERS OF OTHER MEN I FOUND HERE TOO SCARCE ANY GROUND FOR SETTLED CONVICTION AND REMARKED HARDLY LESS CONTRADICTION AMONG THEM THAN IN THE OPINIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND EVEN THE MOST FAITHFUL HISTORIES IF THEY DO NOT WHOLLY MISREPRESENT MATTERS OR EXAGGERATE THEIR IMPORTANCE TO RENDER THE ACCOUNT OF THEM MORE WORTHY OF PERUSAL OMIT AT LEAST ALMOST ALWAYS THE MEANEST AND LEAST STRIKING OF THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES
SH THE DOCTOR WHISPERED THAT IS THE PUSHMI PULLYU DON'T LET HIM SEE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM HE GETS SO DREADFULLY EMBARRASSED TELL ME HOW DID YOU COME TO BE LOCKED UP IN THAT LITTLE ROOM
FROM MY CHILDHOOD I HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH LETTERS AND AS I WAS GIVEN TO BELIEVE THAT BY THEIR HELP A CLEAR AND CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THAT IS USEFUL IN LIFE MIGHT BE ACQUIRED I WAS ARDENTLY DESIROUS OF INSTRUCTION
HE ISN'T DROWNED SAID THE PORPOISES IF HE WERE WE WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE HEARD OF IT FROM THE DEEP SEA DECAPODS WE HEAR ALL THE SALT WATER NEWS THE SHELL FISH CALL US THE OCEAN GOSSIPS NO TELL THE LITTLE BOY WE ARE SORRY WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE HIS UNCLE IS
WHEN THE PIRATES CAME AND CAUGHT US THEY SUNK OUR FISHING BOAT AND BROUGHT US BOTH ON TO THIS SHIP THEY TOLD MY UNCLE THAT THEY WANTED HIM TO BE A PIRATE LIKE THEM FOR HE WAS CLEVER AT SAILING A SHIP IN ALL WEATHERS
TREATING OF SUCH BRANCHES AS ARE ESTEEMED THE MOST CURIOUS AND RARE I KNEW THE JUDGMENT WHICH OTHERS HAD FORMED OF ME AND I DID NOT FIND THAT I WAS CONSIDERED INFERIOR TO MY FELLOWS
WE BECOME STRANGERS TO OUR NATIVE COUNTRY AND THE OVER CURIOUS IN THE CUSTOMS OF THE PAST ARE GENERALLY IGNORANT OF THOSE OF THE PRESENT BESIDES FICTITIOUS NARRATIVES LEAD US TO IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITY OF MANY EVENTS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE
PREFATORY NOTE BY THE AUTHOR IF THIS DISCOURSE APPEAR TOO LONG TO BE READ AT ONCE IT MAY BE DIVIDED INTO SIX PARTS
EMBROIDERED WITH FLOWERS OF GOLD JARS OF FINE TOBACCO FROM JAMAICA CARVED IVORY BOXES FULL OF RUSSIAN TEA AN OLD VIOLIN WITH A STRING BROKEN AND A PICTURE ON THE BACK
THAT I WAS CONVINCED I HAD ADVANCED NO FARTHER IN ALL MY ATTEMPTS AT LEARNING THAN THE DISCOVERY AT EVERY TURN OF MY OWN IGNORANCE AND YET I WAS STUDYING IN ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED SCHOOLS IN EUROPE IN WHICH I THOUGHT THERE MUST BE LEARNED MEN
AND THE DOCTOR ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF A MAN WITH RED HAIR AND AN ANCHOR TATTOOED ON HIS ARM
AND DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE BRUTES I AM DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TO BE FOUND COMPLETE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL AND ON THIS POINT TO ADOPT THE COMMON OPINION OF PHILOSOPHERS WHO SAY THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF GREATER AND LESS HOLDS ONLY AMONG THE ACCIDENTS
I GRADUALLY EXTRICATED MYSELF FROM MANY ERRORS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DARKEN OUR NATURAL INTELLIGENCE AND INCAPACITATE US IN GREAT MEASURE FROM LISTENING TO REASON BUT AFTER I HAD BEEN OCCUPIED SEVERAL YEARS IN THUS STUDYING THE BOOK OF THE WORLD
SO THAT THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE I DERIVED FROM THE STUDY CONSISTED IN THIS THAT OBSERVING MANY THINGS WHICH HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND RIDICULOUS TO OUR APPREHENSION
FOR TO HOLD CONVERSE WITH THOSE OF OTHER AGES AND TO TRAVEL ARE ALMOST THE SAME THING IT IS USEFUL TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE MANNERS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS THAT WE MAY BE ENABLED TO FORM A MORE CORRECT JUDGMENT REGARDING OUR OWN
NOW ALL HOLD YOUR BREATH A MOMENT SO I CAN LISTEN WELL
SO THEY ALL CAME BACK TO THE DOOR AND JIP PEERED THROUGH THE KEY HOLE BUT SOMETHING HAD BEEN STOOD AGAINST THE WALL ON THE INSIDE AND HE COULD SEE NOTHING WHILE THEY WERE STANDING AROUND WONDERING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO THE OWL
OF PHILOSOPHY I WILL SAY NOTHING EXCEPT THAT WHEN I SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN CULTIVATED FOR MANY AGES BY THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN AND THAT YET THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MATTER WITHIN ITS SPHERE WHICH IS NOT STILL IN DISPUTE
THE LITTLE BOY SEEMED RATHER FRIGHTENED TO FIND A MAN STANDING THERE BEFORE HIM AND ALL THOSE ANIMALS STARING IN THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE BROKEN DOOR BUT AS SOON AS HE SAW JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MATCH HE STOPPED CRYING AND GOT UP
I LEARNED TO ENTERTAIN TOO DECIDED A BELIEF IN REGARD TO NOTHING OF THE TRUTH OF WHICH I HAD BEEN PERSUADED MERELY BY EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM AND THUS
AND THE PICTURE OF AN ANCHOR TATTOOED ON HIS ARM HE WAS A STRONG MAN A KIND UNCLE AND THE BEST SAILOR IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC HIS FISHING BOAT WAS CALLED THE SAUCY SALLY A CUTTER RIGGED SLOOP
SAID THE PORPOISES FOR WE SAW IT LYING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA BUT THERE WAS NOBODY INSIDE IT BECAUSE WE WENT AND LOOKED HIS LITTLE NEPHEW IS ON THE SHIP WITH ME HERE SAID THE DOCTOR AND HE IS TERRIBLY AFRAID THAT THE PIRATES THREW HIS UNCLE INTO THE SEA
TOO TOO THE LISTENER HAVING THANKED THE SHARKS AGAIN FOR THEIR KINDNESS THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS SET OFF ONCE MORE ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME IN THE SWIFT SHIP WITH THE THREE RED SAILS AS THEY MOVED OUT INTO THE OPEN SEA
I ENTIRELY ABANDONED THE STUDY OF LETTERS AND RESOLVED NO LONGER TO SEEK ANY OTHER SCIENCE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE OF MYSELF OR OF THE GREAT BOOK OF THE WORLD I SPENT THE REMAINDER OF MY YOUTH IN TRAVELING IN VISITING COURTS AND ARMIES
OR IN FULLNESS AND READINESS OF MEMORY AND BESIDES THESE I KNOW OF NO OTHER QUALITIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERFECTION OF THE MIND
AND IN THE FIRST WILL BE FOUND VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS TOUCHING THE SCIENCES IN THE SECOND THE PRINCIPAL RULES OF THE METHOD WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS DISCOVERED IN THE THIRD CERTAIN OF THE RULES OF MORALS WHICH HE HAS DEDUCED FROM THIS METHOD IN THE FOURTH
AND IN ESSAYING TO GATHER SOME EXPERIENCE I AT LENGTH RESOLVED TO MAKE MYSELF AN OBJECT OF STUDY AND TO EMPLOY ALL THE POWERS OF MY MIND IN CHOOSING THE PATHS I OUGHT TO FOLLOW
YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT IN YOUR LIFE
FOR MYSELF I HAVE NEVER FANCIED MY MIND TO BE IN ANY RESPECT MORE PERFECT THAN THOSE OF THE GENERALITY ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE OFTEN WISHED THAT I WERE EQUAL TO SOME OTHERS IN PROMPTITUDE OF THOUGHT OR IN CLEARNESS AND DISTINCTNESS OF IMAGINATION
THE MAN IN THERE IS UNHAPPY HE WEEPS HE HAS TAKEN CARE NOT TO BLUBBER OR SNIFFLE LEST WE SHOULD FIND OUT THAT HE IS CRYING BUT I HEARD
AND WHO CAN GIVE EXPRESSION TO THEM WITH THE GREATEST EMBELLISHMENT AND HARMONY ARE STILL THE BEST POETS THOUGH UNACQUAINTED WITH THE ART OF POETRY I WAS ESPECIALLY DELIGHTED WITH THE MATHEMATICS ON ACCOUNT OF THE CERTITUDE AND EVIDENCE OF THEIR REASONINGS
LIFT ME UP AND LET ME LISTEN AT THE KEY HOLE AND I'LL SOON TELL YOU
BUT WE ARE QUITE CERTAIN HE HASN'T BEEN DROWNED IN THE SEA SO THE DOCTOR RAN DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE NEWS AND TOLD THE NEPHEW WHO CLAPPED HIS HANDS WITH HAPPINESS AND THE PUSHMI PULLYU TOOK THE LITTLE BOY ON HIS BACK AND GAVE HIM A RIDE ROUND THE DINING ROOM TABLE
ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THINK LOWLY ENOUGH OF MYSELF AND ALTHOUGH WHEN I LOOK WITH THE EYE OF A PHILOSOPHER AT THE VARIED COURSES AND PURSUITS OF MANKIND AT LARGE I FIND SCARCELY ONE WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR IN VAIN AND USELESS
ARE ALWAYS THE BEST ABLE TO PERSUADE OTHERS OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT THEY LAY DOWN THOUGH THEY SHOULD SPEAK ONLY IN THE LANGUAGE OF LOWER BRITTANY AND BE WHOLLY IGNORANT OF THE RULES OF RHETORIC AND THOSE WHOSE MINDS ARE STORED WITH THE MOST AGREEABLE FANCIES
BUT I HAD NOT AS YET A PRECISE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR TRUE USE AND THINKING THAT THEY BUT CONTRIBUTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE MECHANICAL ARTS I WAS ASTONISHED THAT FOUNDATIONS SO STRONG AND SOLID SHOULD HAVE HAD NO LOFTIER SUPERSTRUCTURE REARED ON THEM
HENCE IT HAPPENS THAT THE REMAINDER DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TRUTH AND THAT SUCH AS REGULATE THEIR CONDUCT BY EXAMPLES DRAWN FROM THIS SOURCE ARE APT TO FALL INTO THE EXTRAVAGANCES OF THE KNIGHT ERRANTS OF ROMANCE AND TO ENTERTAIN PROJECTS THAT EXCEED THEIR POWERS
I YET MADE VERY SLIGHT ACCOUNT OF THAT HONOR WHICH I HOPED TO ACQUIRE ONLY THROUGH FICTITIOUS TITLES AND IN FINE OF FALSE SCIENCES I THOUGHT I KNEW THE WORTH SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE BEING DECEIVED BY THE PROFESSIONS OF AN ALCHEMIST THE PREDICTIONS OF AN ASTROLOGER
SIX WINE GLASSES WITH TURQUOISE AND SILVER ROUND THE RIMS AND A LOVELY GREAT SUGAR BOWL MADE OF MOTHER O PEARL BUT NOWHERE IN THE WHOLE BOAT COULD THEY FIND A KEY TO FIT THAT LOCK
BUT THEY GIVE US NO ADEQUATE CRITERION OF VIRTUE AND FREQUENTLY THAT WHICH THEY DESIGNATE WITH SO FINE A NAME IS BUT APATHY OR PRIDE OR DESPAIR OR PARRICIDE I REVERED OUR THEOLOGY AND ASPIRED AS MUCH AS ANY ONE TO REACH HEAVEN
SAID THE OWL SH THERE IT IS AGAIN DON'T YOU HEAR THAT NO I DO NOT SAID THE DOCTOR WHAT KIND OF A SOUND IS IT
I MYSELF MAY HAVE A NEW HELP TOWARDS INSTRUCTION TO BE ADDED TO THOSE I HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF EMPLOYING MY PRESENT DESIGN THEN IS NOT TO TEACH THE METHOD WHICH EACH OUGHT TO FOLLOW FOR THE RIGHT CONDUCT OF HIS REASON
THAN THEY ALREADY POSSESS AND IN THIS IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ALL ARE MISTAKEN THE CONVICTION IS RATHER TO BE HELD AS TESTIFYING THAT THE POWER OF JUDGING ARIGHT AND OF DISTINGUISHING TRUTH FROM ERROR
PARDON ME BUT I CAN SAID TOO TOO I TELL YOU THERE IS SOME ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET ALMOST
I HAD ALWAYS A MOST EARNEST DESIRE TO KNOW HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE CLEARLY TO DISCRIMINATE THE RIGHT PATH IN LIFE AND PROCEED IN IT WITH CONFIDENCE IT IS TRUE THAT
WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO FIND OUT FOR ME FOR SURE WHETHER HE HAS BEEN DROWNED OR NOT
USING ONLY ONE EAR THE COLOR OF A KITTEN FROM THE WAY IT WINKS IN THE DARK WELL WELL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU SURPRISE ME THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
WHAT I'M DOING NOW
SAID JIP IN A WHISPER YES VERY RUM SAID GUB GUB THE SMELL MAKES ME GIDDY
THE ROOM WAS QUITE SMALL NO WINDOW THE CEILING LOW FOR FURNITURE THERE WAS ONLY ONE LITTLE STOOL
I WILL NOT HESITATE HOWEVER TO AVOW MY BELIEF THAT IT HAS BEEN MY SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE VERY EARLY IN LIFE FALLEN IN WITH CERTAIN TRACKS WHICH HAVE CONDUCTED ME TO CONSIDERATIONS AND MAXIMS OF WHICH I HAVE FORMED A METHOD THAT GIVES ME THE MEANS AS I THINK
THAT IT IS USEFUL TO BESTOW SOME ATTENTION UPON ALL EVEN UPON THOSE ABOUNDING THE MOST IN SUPERSTITION AND ERROR THAT WE MAY BE IN A POSITION TO DETERMINE THEIR REAL VALUE AND GUARD AGAINST BEING DECEIVED
I DO BELIEVE THERE'S SOME ONE IN THERE THEY ALL KEPT STILL A MOMENT THEN THE DOCTOR SAID YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN TOO TOO I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING
BUT I BELIEVED THAT I HAD ALREADY GIVEN SUFFICIENT TIME TO LANGUAGES AND LIKEWISE TO THE READING OF THE WRITINGS OF THE ANCIENTS TO THEIR HISTORIES AND FABLES
AND CANNOT HELP ENTERTAINING SUCH EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE AS TO BELIEVE THAT IF AMONG THE OCCUPATIONS OF MEN AS MEN THERE IS ANY ONE REALLY EXCELLENT AND IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN AFTER ALL IT IS POSSIBLE I MAY BE MISTAKEN
EVERYBODY QUITE STILL SHUT YOUR EYES AND DON'T BREATHE TOO TOO LEANED DOWN AND LISTENED AGAIN VERY HARD AND LONG AT LAST HE LOOKED UP INTO THE DOCTOR'S FACE AND SAID
MY UNCLE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN I ASKED THE PIRATES WHERE HE WAS BUT THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THEY THREW HIM INTO THE SEA AND DROWNED HIM
THEY LOOKED IN ALL THE CUPBOARDS AND DRAWERS AND LOCKERS IN THE BIG CHESTS IN THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM THEY LOOKED EVERYWHERE WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS THEY DISCOVERED A LOT OF NEW AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT THE PIRATES MUST HAVE STOLEN FROM OTHER SHIPS
ONLY THEIR CHOICEST THOUGHTS THAT ELOQUENCE HAS INCOMPARABLE FORCE AND BEAUTY THAT POESY HAS ITS RAVISHING GRACES AND DELIGHTS THAT IN THE MATHEMATICS THERE ARE MANY REFINED DISCOVERIES EMINENTLY SUITED TO GRATIFY THE INQUISITIVE
THE IMPOSTURES OF A MAGICIAN OR BY THE ARTIFICES AND BOASTING OF ANY OF THOSE WHO PROFESS TO KNOW THINGS OF WHICH THEY ARE IGNORANT FOR THESE REASONS AS SOON AS MY AGE PERMITTED ME TO PASS FROM UNDER THE CONTROL OF MY INSTRUCTORS
AND BE PREVENTED FROM THINKING THAT EVERYTHING CONTRARY TO OUR CUSTOMS IS RIDICULOUS AND IRRATIONAL A CONCLUSION USUALLY COME TO BY THOSE WHOSE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN TOO MUCH TIME IS OCCUPIED IN TRAVELING
A SET OF BIG CHESS MEN CARVED OUT OF CORAL AND AMBER A WALKING STICK WHICH HAD A SWORD INSIDE
DOES NOT ARISE FROM SOME BEING ENDOWED WITH A LARGER SHARE OF REASON THAN OTHERS BUT SOLELY FROM THIS THAT WE CONDUCT OUR THOUGHTS ALONG DIFFERENT WAYS AND DO NOT FIX OUR ATTENTION ON THE SAME OBJECTS
I WAS THUS LED TO TAKE THE LIBERTY OF JUDGING OF ALL OTHER MEN BY MYSELF AND OF CONCLUDING THAT THERE WAS NO SCIENCE IN EXISTENCE THAT WAS OF SUCH A NATURE AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GIVEN TO BELIEVE I STILL CONTINUED HOWEVER
LISTEN AGAIN AND TELL ME WHAT HE'S DOING NOW I'M NOT SURE YET SAID TOO TOO IF IT'S A MAN AT ALL MAYBE IT'S A WOMAN
IN HOLDING INTERCOURSE WITH MEN OF DIFFERENT DISPOSITIONS AND RANKS IN COLLECTING VARIED EXPERIENCE IN PROVING MYSELF IN THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS INTO WHICH FORTUNE THREW ME AND ABOVE ALL
COME DOWN AND SEE IF YOU CAN LET US IN SO THE DOCTOR WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND HE SAW THAT IT WAS INDEED A BEAUTIFUL SHIP HE FOUND THE ANIMALS GATHERED ROUND A LITTLE DOOR ALL TALKING AT ONCE TRYING TO GUESS WHAT WAS INSIDE
THAN THAT THEY FOSTER HIS VANITY THE BETTER THE MORE REMOTE THEY ARE FROM COMMON SENSE REQUIRING AS THEY MUST IN THIS CASE THE EXERCISE OF GREATER INGENUITY AND ART TO RENDER THEM PROBABLE IN ADDITION
BUT AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE ENTIRE COURSE OF STUDY AT THE CLOSE OF WHICH IT IS CUSTOMARY TO BE ADMITTED INTO THE ORDER OF THE LEARNED I COMPLETELY CHANGED MY OPINION FOR I FOUND MYSELF INVOLVED IN SO MANY DOUBTS AND ERRORS
SUCH IGNORANCE SNIFFED TOO TOO A DROP OF WATER FALLING OFF THE CEILING WOULD HAVE MADE TEN TIMES AS MUCH NOISE WELL SAID THE DOCTOR
THAT MAY BE UPHELD BY LEARNED MEN WHILE THERE CAN BE BUT ONE TRUE I RECKONED AS WELL NIGH FALSE ALL THAT WAS ONLY PROBABLE AS TO THE OTHER SCIENCES
IN A CONDITION WHICH COMPELLED ME TO MAKE MERCHANDISE OF SCIENCE FOR THE BETTERING OF MY FORTUNE AND THOUGH I MIGHT NOT PROFESS TO SCORN GLORY AS A CYNIC
AS ALSO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SOUL OF MAN AND THAT OF THE BRUTES AND IN THE LAST WHAT THE AUTHOR BELIEVES TO BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO GREATER ADVANCEMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE THAN HAS YET BEEN MADE WITH THE REASONS THAT HAVE INDUCED HIM TO WRITE
AND NOTHING THEREFORE WHICH IS ABOVE DOUBT I DID NOT PRESUME TO ANTICIPATE THAT MY SUCCESS WOULD BE GREATER IN IT THAN THAT OF OTHERS AND FURTHER WHEN I CONSIDERED THE NUMBER OF CONFLICTING OPINIONS TOUCHING A SINGLE MATTER
AND WENT UPSTAIRS TO LOOK FOR PASSING PORPOISES AND SOON A WHOLE SCHOOL CAME DANCING AND JUMPING THROUGH THE WATER ON THEIR WAY TO BRAZIL WHEN THEY SAW THE DOCTOR LEANING ON THE RAIL OF HIS SHIP THEY CAME OVER TO SEE HOW HE WAS GETTING ON
BUT BEING GIVEN ASSUREDLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WAY IS NOT LESS OPEN TO THE MOST IGNORANT THAN TO THE MOST LEARNED AND THAT THE REVEALED TRUTHS WHICH LEAD TO HEAVEN ARE ABOVE OUR COMPREHENSION I DID NOT PRESUME TO SUBJECT THEM TO THE IMPOTENCY OF MY REASON
NOW HE PUSHES HIS HAIR BACK OFF HIS FOREHEAD IT'S A MAN ALL RIGHT WOMEN SOMETIMES DO THAT SAID THE DOCTOR TRUE SAID THE OWL
AND IT IS BUT A LITTLE COPPER AND GLASS PERHAPS THAT I TAKE FOR GOLD AND DIAMONDS I KNOW HOW VERY LIABLE WE ARE TO DELUSION IN WHAT RELATES TO OURSELVES AND ALSO HOW MUCH THE JUDGMENTS OF OUR FRIENDS ARE TO BE SUSPECTED WHEN GIVEN IN OUR FAVOR
YOU AREN'T ONE OF THE PIRATES ARE YOU HE ASKED AND WHEN THE DOCTOR THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED LONG AND LOUD THE LITTLE BOY SMILED TOO AND CAME AND TOOK HIS HAND YOU LAUGH LIKE A FRIEND
TAKING A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AND JAM WHAT ARE THOSE FUNNY CLICKING NOISES YOU ARE MAKING WITH YOUR TONGUE ASKED THE BOY OH I JUST SAID A COUPLE OF WORDS IN DUCK LANGUAGE THE DOCTOR ANSWERED
THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER
EVERYTHING MAKES SOME NOISE IF YOUR EARS ARE ONLY SHARP ENOUGH TO CATCH IT BATS CAN HEAR A MOLE WALKING IN HIS TUNNEL UNDER THE EARTH
GOOD SENSE IS OF ALL THINGS AMONG MEN THE MOST EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED FOR EVERY ONE THINKS HIMSELF SO ABUNDANTLY PROVIDED WITH IT
WHICH IS PROPERLY WHAT IS CALLED GOOD SENSE OR REASON IS BY NATURE EQUAL IN ALL MEN
THE DOCTOR TURNED THE HANDLE BUT IT WOULDN'T OPEN THEN THEY ALL STARTED TO HUNT FOR THE KEY THEY LOOKED UNDER THE MAT
IS INFINITELY INTERESTING AND LEADS TO A FAIRLY CLEAR CONCEPTION BY WHICH EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED BY A MECHANISM REFLECTED IN A MIRROR WHICH IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS BUT WE REMAIN PERPLEXED
THE DWARF THO DUMB WAS NOT WHOLLY FORGOTTEN THE FISHERMAN WAS PUT INTO THE POSSESSION OF A VERY HANDSOME HOUSE
PLURALITY AND NUMERICAL DIFFERENCE ARE GIVEN BY SPACE ITSELF AS THE CONDITION OF EXTERNAL PHENOMENA FOR ONE PART OF SPACE ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE PERFECTLY SIMILAR AND EQUAL TO ANOTHER PART IS STILL WITHOUT IT AND FOR THIS REASON ALONE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE LATTER
EACH PASS'D HIS VERDICT ZADIG WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT CONCLUDED IT WAS LIFE HE SOLV'D EVERY A ENIGMA PROPOS'D WITH EQUAL FACILITY ITOBAD WHEN HE HEARD THE EXPLICATIONS
AND CONSIDERS THEM THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF THE EXTERNAL EXCITANT WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY THIS ELEGANT FORMULA
HOWEVER SIMILAR AND EQUAL ONE MAY BE TO ANOTHER TWO AGREEMENT AND OPPOSITION WHEN REALITY IS REPRESENTED BY THE PURE UNDERSTANDING REALITAS NOUMENON
AND DETERMINE THEIR POSSIBILITY AN OBJECTION PERFECTLY CORRECT IF WE ASSUME THAT WE INTUITE THINGS AS THEY ARE ALTHOUGH WITH CONFUSED REPRESENTATION
THESE TWO CONCEPTIONS LIE AT THE FOUNDATION OF ALL OTHER REFLECTION SO INSEPARABLY ARE THEY CONNECTED WITH EVERY MODE OF EXERCISING THE UNDERSTANDING THE FORMER DENOTES THE DETERMINABLE IN GENERAL THE SECOND ITS DETERMINATION
THEY ANNIHILATE THE EFFECTS OF EACH OTHER AND MAY BE REPRESENTED IN THE FORMULA
UNDER THE FORM OF TACTILE MUSCULAR THERMAL AND OTHER SENSATIONS UNTIL NOW THIS CATEGORY OF PHENOMENA HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT NEGLECTED BECAUSE WE SAW IN IT EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH THE ROLE IN EMOTION ITSELF SEEMED SLIGHT
WHAT IS THE LONGEST AND YET THE SHORTEST THING IN THE WORLD THE MOST SWIFT AND THE MOST SLOW THE MOST DIVISIBLE AND THE MOST EXTENDED THE LEAST VALU'D AND THE MOST REGRETTED
AND DIVISIBLE TO INFINITY IN PART ALL MEN NEGLECT IT IN THE PASSAGE AND ALL REGRET THE LOSS OF IT WHEN TIS PAST NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE WITHOUT IT IT BURIES IN OBLIVION WHATEVER IS UNWORTHY OF BEING TRANSMITTED
MONADS AND OF AN INTERNAL POWER OF REPRESENTATION IN THEM
WHO BY THE BY GAVE IT A PECULIAR FORM BY CAUSING THE PLAY OF IMAGES TO INTERVENE IN THE FORMATION OF THE FEELINGS HOWEVER THIS PARTICULAR POINT IS OF SLIGHT IMPORTANCE
I WHO COMPLAIN I WHO HOPE IT IS TRUE THAT THIS ATTRIBUTION IS NOT ABSOLUTELY CHARACTERISTIC OF MENTAL PHENOMENA FOR IT HAPPENS THAT WE PUT A PART OF OUR EGO INTO MATERIAL OBJECTS SUCH AS OUR BODIES
THE FACT OF PERCEIVING SOMETHING TO PERCEIVE IS IN FACT THE PROPERTY OF INTELLIGENCE TO REASON TO IMAGINE TO JUDGE TO UNDERSTAND IS ALWAYS IN A CERTAIN SENSE TO PERCEIVE
IT EXISTS IN ALL DOCTRINES IN WHICH THE CHARACTERISTIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOUGHT AND FEELING IS EXPUNGED AND FEELING IS BROUGHT BACK TO THOUGHT
IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT EMOTION IS NOTHING ELSE THAN A PERCEPTION OF A CERTAIN KIND AN INTELLECTUAL ACT STRICTLY COMPARABLE TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF A LANDSCAPE ONLY IN THE PLACE OF A LANDSCAPE WITH PLACID FEATURES
SO THERE EXISTS AN INTELLECTUALIST THEORY OF EFFORT WHICH LIKEWISE TENDS TO BRING BACK ALL WILL TO INTELLIGENCE IT IS AGAIN THE SAME AUTHOR THAT TRUE GENIUS W JAMES WHO HAS ATTEMPTED THIS REDUCTION
ARE THE MATTER THE MODE IN WHICH THEY ARE CONNECTED IN THE OBJECT THE FORM IN RESPECT TO THINGS IN GENERAL UNLIMITED REALITY WAS REGARDED AS THE MATTER OF ALL POSSIBILITY THE LIMITATION THEREOF NEGATION AS THE FORM
OR ELSE IT IS THE SECRETION OF THE SALIVA OR OF THE SWEAT WHICH FLOWS IN ABUNDANCE OR DRIES UP OR THE MUSCULAR FORCE WHICH IS INCREASED OR DECAYS
OR TO THE SENSES MANY JUDGEMENTS ARE ADMITTED TO BE TRUE FROM MERE HABIT OR INCLINATION BUT BECAUSE REFLECTION NEITHER PRECEDES NOR FOLLOWS
BUT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE IN THIS RESPECT PERFECTLY THE SAME
NOW THE RELATIONS IN WHICH CONCEPTIONS CAN STAND TO EACH OTHER ARE THOSE OF IDENTITY AND DIFFERENCE AGREEMENT AND OPPOSITION OF THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FINALLY OF THE DETERMINABLE AND THE DETERMINING MATTER AND FORM
CONSEQUENTLY SPACE AND TIME MUST ANTECEDE ALL PHENOMENA AND ALL DATA OF EXPERIENCE AND RATHER MAKE EXPERIENCE ITSELF POSSIBLE BUT THE INTELLECTUAL PHILOSOPHER COULD NOT ENDURE THAT THE FORM SHOULD PRECEDE THE THINGS THEMSELVES
THUS WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE THINGS ARE IDENTICAL OR DIFFERENT IN AGREEMENT OR OPPOSITION ET CETERA
DEFINITION OF THE EMOTIONS AFTER SENSATIONS AND IMAGES WE HAVE TO NAME AMONG THE PHENOMENA OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE WHOLE SERIES OF AFFECTIVE STATES OUR PLEASURES AND OUR PAINS OUR JOYS AND OUR GRIEFS
WHICH APPEAR TO US AS PERCEIVED BY US BUT AS BEING OTHER THAN OURSELVES ON THE CONTRARY WE CONSTANTLY AND WITHOUT HESITATION REFER OUR EMOTIONAL STATES TO OUR EGO IT IS I WHO SUFFER WE SAY
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS SWAY'D BY LOVE AND JUSTICE EVERY ONE BLEST ZADIG AND ZADIG BLEST HEAV'N FOR HIS UNEXPECTED SUCCESS
AS REPRESENTING THE ESSENCE OF MIND ON THIS POINT I WILL RECALL THE FINE IRONICAL IMAGE USED BY TYNDALL THE ILLUSTRIOUS ENGLISH PHYSICIST TO SHOW THE ABYSS WHICH SEPARATES THOUGHT FROM THE MOLECULAR STATES OF THE BRAIN LET US SUPPOSE HE SAYS
AND WHEN WE HATE IN ANOTHER BUT THE WHY WOULD REMAIN WITHOUT AN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF KNOWING WHAT PLACE IN OUR METAPHYSICAL THEORY WE OUGHT TO SECURE FOR EMOTION SEEMS DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE
UPON HIS FORT AS THE SWORDS MEN CALL IT BY WHICH MEANS ITOBAD'S SWORD WAS SNAPT IN TWO WITH THAT ZADIG IN AN INSTANT CLOS'D HIS ADVERSARY AND BY HIS SUPERIOR STRENGTH AS WELL AS SKILL
COMPARATIO BUT ONLY BY DISTINGUISHING THE MODE OF COGNITION TO WHICH THEY BELONG IN OTHER WORDS BY MEANS OF TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION WE MAY THEREFORE WITH JUSTICE SAY THAT LOGICAL REFLECTION IS MERE COMPARISON
OR IT IS THE HEART WHICH HASTENS OR SLACKENS ITS BEATS OR MAKES THEM IRREGULAR OR ENFEEBLES OR AUGMENTS THEM OR THE RESPIRATION WHICH CHANGES ITS RHYTHM OR INCREASES OR IS SUSPENDED
THAT IS OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS HENCE WITH HIM SPACE AND TIME WERE POSSIBLE
OF HIS POMPOUS HELMET HIS SUPERB CUIRASS HIS RICH BRACELETS HIS BRILLIANT CUISSES OR ARMOUR FOR HIS THIGHS AND OTHER MARTIAL ACCOUTREMENTS WHEN ZADIG HAD EQUIPP'D HIMSELF CAP A PEE IN HIS NOW RECOVER'D ARMOUR
ALL JUDGEMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE EXAMINATION THAT IS INVESTIGATION INTO THE GROUNDS OF THEIR TRUTH FOR WHEN THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY CERTAIN FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN TWO POINTS THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE STRAIGHT LINE
IF A GENERAL JUDGEMENT IS TO BE CONSTRUCTED OR DIFFERENCE IF A PARTICULAR WHETHER THERE IS AGREEMENT WHEN AFFIRMATIVE AND OPPOSITION WHEN NEGATIVE JUDGEMENTS ARE TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND SO ON FOR THIS REASON WE OUGHT TO CALL THESE CONCEPTIONS
BUT VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN AS TO WHAT DISTINGUISHES AN EMOTION FROM A THOUGHT TWO PRINCIPAL OPINIONS MAY BE UPHELD IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE FEELINGS WHEN WE ENDEAVOUR TO PENETRATE THEIR ESSENTIAL AND FINAL NATURE
IN A CONCEPTION OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING THE MATTER PRECEDES THE FORM AND FOR THIS REASON
WHAT WE THEN PERCEIVE WILL BE AN EMOTION SUCH IS THE THEORY THAT TWO AUTHORS
FOR IN IT NO ACCOUNT IS TAKEN OF THE FACULTY OF COGNITION TO WHICH THE GIVEN CONCEPTIONS BELONG AND THEY ARE CONSEQUENTLY AS FAR AS REGARDS THEIR ORIGIN TO BE TREATED AS HOMOGENEOUS WHILE TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION
BY WHICH ONE THING IS DISTINGUISHED FROM ANOTHER ACCORDING TO TRANSCENDENTAL CONCEPTIONS THE UNDERSTANDING DEMANDS THAT SOMETHING BE GIVEN AT LEAST IN THE CONCEPTION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IT IN A CERTAIN MANNER HENCE
AND WE EVEN FIND SOME PLEASURE IN LEAVING IT IN SUSPENSE IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE UNDERSTOOD THAT A METAPHYSICIAN IS NOT COMPELLED TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING BESIDES THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH ATOP US HERE ARE PECULIARLY OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL ORDER
HE DID NOT DOUBT BUT BEING PROPERLY ACCOUTRED WITH HIS HELMET HIS CUIRASS AND HIS BRACELETS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HUE DOWN AN ANTAGONIST IN HIS MANTLE AND CAP AND NOTHING TO SKREEN HIM FROM HIS RESENTMENT BUT A SINGLE SABRE
WITH LOUD ACCLAMATIONS ATTENDED HIM TO THE PALACE GATE THE QUEEN WHO HAD HEARD OF HIS ARRIVAL WAS IN THE UTMOST AGONY BETWEEN HOPE AND DESPAIR HER VEXATION HAD ALMOST BROUGHT HER TO DEATH'S DOOR
IT USED TO BE SAID I PERCEIVE A DANGER I AM FRIGHTENED I TREMBLE NOW WE MUST SAY I TREMBLE BEFORE A DANGER FIRST AND IT IS AFTER HAVING TREMBLED THAT I AM FRIGHTENED
OR THE ALMOST UNDEFINABLE ORGANIC TROUBLES REVEALED TO US BY THE SINGING IN THE EARS CONSTRICTION OF THE EPIGASTRIUM THE JERKS THE TREMBLING VERTIGO OR NAUSEA ALL THIS COLLECTION OF ORGANIC TROUBLES
PRINCIPIUM IDENTATIS INDISCERNIBILIUM IS NOT TO BE IMPUGNED BUT AS PHENOMENA ARE OBJECTS OF SENSIBILITY AND AS THE UNDERSTANDING IN RESPECT OF THEM MUST BE EMPLOYED EMPIRICALLY AND NOT PURELY OR TRANSCENDENTALLY
HAPPENED TO DISCOVER ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME
NOW HE BEGAN TO REFLECT ON WHAT THE ANGEL JESRAD HAD SAID TO HIM NAY HE REFLECTED SO FAR BACK AS THE STORY OF THE ARABIAN ATOM OF DUST METAMORPHOSED INTO A DIAMOND
THAT THE WHITE ARMOUR WAS ZADIG'S PROPERTY HE WAS THEREUPON ACKNOWLEDG'D KING OF BABYLON BY THE UNANIMOUS CONTENT OF THE WHOLE COURT BUT MORE PARTICULARLY
THAT THE SENTIMENT LOVE FOR EXAMPLE CORRESPONDS TO A RIGHT HAND SPIRAL MOVEMENT OF THE MOLECULES OF THE BRAIN AND THE SENTIMENT HATRED TO A LEFT HAND SPIRAL MOVEMENT WE SHOULD THEN KNOW THAT WHEN WE LOVE A MOVEMENT IS PRODUCED IN ONE DIRECTION
TO BE CONSCIOUS OF AN EFFORT WOULD THEN BE NOTHING ELSE THAN TO RECEIVE ALL THESE CENTRIPETAL SENSATIONS AND WHAT PROVES THIS IS THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EFFORT WHEN MOST CLEARLY MANIFESTED IS ACCOMPANIED BY SOME MUSCULAR ENERGY
THE AENIGMAS OR RIDDLES ZADIG AS ONE BESIDE HIMSELF AND PERFECTLY THUNDER STRUCK BEAT HIS MARCH AT RANDOM HE ENTRED HOWEVER INTO THE CITY OF BABYLON
THIS IS NOT A CHANGE IN ORDER ONLY IT IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE SERIOUS THE CHANGE IS DIRECTED TO THE NATURE OF EMOTION IT IS CONSIDERED TO EXIST IN THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS INDICATED ABOVE
ZADIG DREW HIS SWORD AND SALUTED THE QUEEN WITH IT WHO VIEW'D HIM WITH TRANSPORT MIX'D WITH FEAR ITOBAD DREW HIS BUT PAID HIS COMPLIMENTS TO NOBODY
BOTH IN A TRANSCENDENTAL SENSE ABSTRACTION BEING MADE OF EVERY DIFFERENCE IN THAT WHICH IS GIVEN AND OF THE MODE IN WHICH IT IS DETERMINED LOGICIANS FORMERLY TERMED THE UNIVERSAL MATTER THE SPECIFIC DIFFERENCE OF THIS OR THAT PART OF THE UNIVERSAL FORM
NOTHING PASSES SO SLOWLY AS TIME TO HIM WHO IS IN EXPECTATION AND NOTHING SO SWIFT AS TIME TO HIM WHO IS IN THE PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF HIS WISHES IT'S EXTENT IS TO INFINITY IN THE WHOLE
ZADIG'S ANSWERS STILL CARRIED THE GREATEST WEIGHT WHAT PITY TIS SAID SOME WHO WERE PRESENT THAT ONE OF SO COMPREHENSIVE A GENIUS SHOULD MAKE SUCH A SCURVY CAVALIER MOST ILLUSTRIOUS GRANDEES
BUT BEING MERELY SENSUOUS INTUITIONS IN WHICH WE DETERMINE ALL OBJECTS SOLELY AS PHENOMENA THE FORM OF INTUITION AS A SUBJECTIVE PROPERTY OF SENSIBILITY MUST ANTECEDE ALL MATTER SENSATIONS
ARE NOTHING BUT RELATIONS AND IT IS ITSELF NOTHING MORE THAN A COMPLEX OF MERE RELATIONS SUBSTANCE IN SPACE WE ARE COGNIZANT OF ONLY THROUGH FORCES OPERATIVE IN IT EITHER DRAWING OTHERS TOWARDS ITSELF ATTRACTION
AND EVEN INTO OBJECTS SEPARATE FROM OUR BODIES AND WHOSE SOLE RELATION TO US IS THAT OF A LEGAL PROPRIETORSHIP WE MUST GUARD AGAINST THE SOMEWHAT FREQUENT ERROR OF IDENTIFYING THE EGO WITH THE PSYCHICAL
WHICH DOES NOT BELONG TO THE PHYSICAL DOMAIN AND WHICH FORMS THE MORAL WORLD
TOGETHER WITH THE FAIR ALMONZA HIS NEW BRIDE
THE TRANSLATION AND THE DISTANT EFFECTS OF THE EMOTIONS CONSTITUTE THEIR ESSENTIAL BASE THESE EFFECTS ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THE PHYSIOGNOMY THE GESTURE THE CRY AND THE SPEECH
COMFORTLESS NOTWITHSTANDING HER AFFECTIONATE INTENTION TO SHORTEN HIS NOSE FOR HE SOOTH'D THEIR SORROWS BY VERY MUNIFICENT PRESENTS THE ENVIOUS INFORMER INDEED
AND THEREBY THROW NOT A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE QUESTION AS TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROPER BUSINESS OF THE UNDERSTANDING ONE IDENTITY AND DIFFERENCE WHEN AN OBJECT IS PRESENTED TO US SEVERAL TIMES BUT ALWAYS WITH THE SAME INTERNAL DETERMINATIONS
AS WE DO OUR INDIFFERENT SENSATIONS THE SENSATIONS OF WEIGHT
THE FIRST AND TRADITIONAL ONE CONSISTS IN SEEING IN EMOTION A PHENOMENON SUI GENERIS THIS IS VERY SIMPLE AND LEAVES NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID
DECLARED THAT ALL SUBSTANCES EVEN THE COMPONENT PARTS OF MATTER WERE SIMPLE SUBSTANCES WITH POWERS OF REPRESENTATION IN ONE WORD MONADS FOUR MATTER AND FORM
THE QUEEN AND HE ADOR'D THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE ZADIG PERMITTED MISSOUF THE FAIR COQUET TO MAKE HER CONQUESTS WHERE SHE COULD HE SENT COURIERS TO BRING THE FREE BOOTER ARBOGAD TO COURT
YOU MUST PUT A STORM A CATACLYSM OF NATURE AND INSTEAD OF SUPPOSING THIS STORM OUTSIDE US LET IT BURST WITHIN US LET IT REACH US NOT BY THE OUTER SENSES OF SIGHT AND CONDITION BUT BY THE INNER SENSES
WHICH APPLIES TO THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES CONTAINS THE GROUND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OBJECTIVE COMPARISON OF REPRESENTATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AND IS THEREFORE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE FORMER BECAUSE THE FACULTIES OF COGNITION TO WHICH THEY BELONG ARE NOT EVEN THE SAME
AND W JAMES AS A PHILOSOPHER THEIR THEORY AT FIRST SIGHT APPEARS SINGULAR LIKE EVERYTHING WHICH RUNS COUNTER TO OUR MENTAL HABITS IT LAYS DOWN THAT THE SYMPTOMS WHICH WE ALL TILL NOW
THAT HE'D MAKE A PUBLICK EXAMPLE OF HIM IF HE FOLLOW'D HIS PROFESSION OF FREE BOOTING FOR THE FUTURE
AND GAVE HIM AN HONOURABLE MILITARY POST IN HIS ARMY WITH A FARTHER PROMISE OF PROMOTION TO THE HIGHEST DIGNITY BUT UPON THIS EXPRESS CONDITION THAT HE WOULD ACT FOR THE FUTURE AS A SOLDIER OF HONOUR BUT ASSUR'D HIM AT THE SAME TIME
AND WE ASK OURSELVES WHETHER THIS CLEARNESS OF PERCEPTION IS NOT SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL WHETHER AFFECTIVITY EMOTIVITY TENDENCY WILL ARE REALLY ALL REDUCED TO PERCEPTIONS OR WHETHER THEY ARE NOT RATHER IRREDUCIBLE ELEMENTS
FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECTLY OBTAINING CONCEPTIONS OF THEM BUT IS THAT STATE OF THE MIND IN WHICH WE SET OURSELVES TO DISCOVER THE SUBJECTIVE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OBTAIN CONCEPTIONS IT IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE RELATION OF GIVEN REPRESENTATIONS
BY THE SIDE OF EMOTION WE MAY PLACE AS DEMANDING THE SAME ANALYTICAL STUDY THE FEELING OF EFFORT WE OUGHT TO INQUIRE WITH EFFORT AS HAS BEEN DONE WITH EMOTION WHAT IS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON
ON THE OTHER HAND THE REAL IN A PHENOMENON REALITAS PHAENOMENON MAY VERY WELL BE IN MUTUAL OPPOSITION AND WHEN UNITED IN THE SAME SUBJECT THE ONE MAY COMPLETELY OR IN PART ANNIHILATE THE EFFECT OR CONSEQUENCE OF THE OTHER
OR THE REFLEX ACTION ON THE CIRCULATION THE PALLOR OR BLUSHING
THO ANOTHER APPEARS CLAD IN MY ARMOUR BUT IN THE MEAN TIME BEFORE I CAN POSSIBLY PROVE MY ASSERTION I INSIST UPON BEING ADMITTED INTO COURT
ON THAT VERY DAY WHEN THOSE COMBATANTS WHO HAD BEEN BEFORE ENGAG'D IN THE LIST OR CIRCUS WERE ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE SPACIOUS OUTER COURT OF THE PALACE
TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION IS A DUTY WHICH NO ONE CAN NEGLECT WHO WISHES TO ESTABLISH AN A PRIORI JUDGEMENT UPON THINGS WE SHALL NOW PROCEED TO FULFIL THIS DUTY
LAID HIM SPRAWLING ON HIS BACK THEN HOLDING THE POINT OF HIS SWORD TO THE OPENING OF HIS CUIRASS SUBMIT TO BE STRIPP'D OF YOUR BORROW'D PLUMES OR YOU ARE A DEAD MAN THIS MOMENT ITOBAD
DEPENDS THE MANNER IN WHICH WE MUST COGITATE THESE RELATIONS BEFORE CONSTRUCTING ANY OBJECTIVE JUDGEMENT WE COMPARE THE CONCEPTIONS THAT ARE TO BE PLACED IN THE JUDGEMENT AND OBSERVE WHETHER THERE EXISTS IDENTITY OF MANY REPRESENTATIONS IN ONE CONCEPTION
SOFTEN'D THE RIGOUR OF THE SENTENCE AND TOOK THE MONEY ONLY IN FULL OF ALL ACCOUNTS HE DIDN'T LEAVE SO MUCH AS SEMIRA WHOLLY DISCONSOLATE THO SHE HAD SUCH AN AVERSION TO A BLIND EYE NOR AZORA
TO ENGAGE WITH THE USURPER OF THE WHITE ARMOUR WITH MY SWORD ONLY IN MY MANTLE AND BONNET AND TO TESTIFY THAT I ONLY WAS THE HAPPY VICTOR OF THE JUSTLY ADMIRED HOTTAM
CONCEPTIONS OF COMPARISON CONCEPTUS COMPARATIONIS
THUS IN THE CASE OF TWO DROPS OF WATER
WITHOUT BEING EVER THANKFUL FOR IT WHICH WE ENJOY WITHOUT KNOWING HOW WE CAME BY IT WHICH WE GIVE AWAY TO OTHERS WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE TIS TO BE FOUND AND WHICH WE LOSE WITHOUT BEING ANY WAYS CONSCIOUS OF OUR MISFORTUNE
THEY PROCEED FROM THE FACT THAT STUDIES ON THE NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS ARE STILL VERY LITTLE ADVANCED THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THESE STATES ARE PRETTY WELL KNOWN AND THEIR PSYCHICAL AND SOCIAL EFFECTS HAVE BEEN ABUNDANTLY DESCRIBED
QUALITY AND QUANTITY AND THE FACT THAT THEY ARE INTUITED AT THE SAME TIME IN DIFFERENT PLACES IS SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY US IN HOLDING THEM TO BE NUMERICALLY DIFFERENT
OF THE EQUIVOCAL NATURE OR AMPHIBOLY OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF REFLECTION FROM THE CONFUSION OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL WITH THE EMPIRICAL USE OF THE UNDERSTANDING REFLECTION REFLEXIO IS NOT OCCUPIED ABOUT OBJECTS THEMSELVES
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE HAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE PARALLELISM OF THE TWO THEORIES BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS EVIDENT EFFORT THAT BASIS OF ACTIVITY THAT STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH SO MANY PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE DESCRIBED AS SOMETHING SUI GENERIS
THESE DERANGEMENTS ARE THE BASIS OF EMOTION ITS PHYSICAL BASIS AND TO BE MOVED IS TO PERCEIVE THEM TAKE AWAY FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THIS PHYSICAL REFLEX AND EMOTION CEASES IT IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT AN IDEA
CONSEQUENTLY AS INTELLIGIBILIA THAT IS OBJECTS OF PURE UNDERSTANDING ALTHOUGH ON ACCOUNT OF THE CONFUSED NATURE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS HE GAVE THEM THE NAME OF PHENOMENA AND IN THIS CASE HIS PRINCIPLE OF THE INDISCERNIBLE
SOME STRONG CONTRACTION OR SOME RESPIRATORY TROUBLE AND YIELDS IF WE RENDER THE RESPIRATION AGAIN REGULAR AND PUT THE MUSCLES BACK INTO REPOSE TO MY GREAT REGRET
THE LATTER THROUGH THE CONNECTION OF THEIR DETERMINATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AS CAUSES AND EFFECTS AND SO WOULD IT REALLY BE IF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING WERE CAPABLE OF AN IMMEDIATE APPLICATION TO OBJECTS AND IF SPACE AND TIME WERE DETERMINATIONS OF THINGS IN THEMSELVES
DIED WITH SHAME AND VEXATION THE EMPIRE WAS GLORIOUS ABROAD AND IN THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF TRANQUILITY PEACE AND PLENTY AT HOME THIS IN SHORT WAS THE TRUE GOLDEN AGE
AND WAS HIS FAVOURITE MINISTER AT COURT AS THE JUST REWARD OF HIS PAST SERVICES HE WAS IN SHORT THE KING'S REAL FRIEND AND ZADIG WAS THE ONLY MONARCH IN THE UNIVERSE THAT COULD BOAST OF SUCH AN ATTENDANT
IN REGARD TO JUSTICE THE SOVEREIGN GOOD
IN A JUDGEMENT ONE MAY CALL THE GIVEN CONCEPTIONS LOGICAL MATTER FOR THE JUDGEMENT
AS WE DO OUR SENSATIONS BUT WE CONSTANTLY CONSIDER THEM AS INDWELLING OR SUBJECTIVE STATES THIS RULE HOWEVER
IN AN OBJECT OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING ONLY THAT IS INTERNAL WHICH HAS NO RELATION AS REGARDS ITS EXISTENCE TO ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM ITSELF ON THE OTHER HAND THE INTERNAL DETERMINATIONS OF A SUBSTANTIA PHAENOMENON IN SPACE
AND ORCAN WAS SENTENC'D NOT ONLY TO PAY HIM A VERY CONSIDERABLE SUM FOR THE INJUSTICE DONE HIM IN DETAINING HIS WIFE BUT TO RESIGN HER LIKEWISE TO THE PROPER OWNER THE FISHERMAN HOWEVER GROWN WISE BY EXPERIENCE
TO THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OR FACULTIES OF COGNITION BY WHICH ALONE THEIR RELATION TO EACH OTHER CAN BE RIGHTLY DETERMINED THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH OCCURS IN CONSIDERING OUR REPRESENTATIONS IS TO WHAT FACULTY OF COGNITION DO THEY BELONG TO THE UNDERSTANDING
BUT WHAT OTHER INTERNAL ATTRIBUTES OF SUCH AN OBJECT CAN I THINK THAN THOSE WHICH MY INTERNAL SENSE PRESENTS TO ME THAT TO WIT
IS LIKEWISE AN INTELLECTUALIST SYSTEM THE DEFINITION OF EMOTION AS IT IS TAUGHT BY W JAMES SEEMS EXPRESSLY MADE FOR US WHO ARE SEEKING TO RESOLVE ALL INTELLECTUAL STATES INTO PHYSICAL IMPRESSIONS ACCOMPANIED BY CONSCIOUSNESS
WHO AFTER SUCH A LONG SERIES OF MISFORTUNES NOW TASTED THE SWEETS OF SEEING HER DARLING ZADIG THOUGHT WORTHY IN THE OPINION OF THE WHOLE WORLD
THE ACT WHEREBY I COMPARE MY REPRESENTATIONS WITH THE FACULTY OF COGNITION WHICH ORIGINATES THEM AND WHEREBY I DISTINGUISH WHETHER THEY ARE COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER AS BELONGING TO THE PURE UNDERSTANDING OR TO SENSUOUS INTUITION I TERM TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION
AND IN THE SAME WAY THAT THERE EXISTS AN INTELLECTUALIST THEORY OF THE EMOTIONS VIZ THAT OF JAMES
THIS THEORY HAS AT LEAST THE MERIT OF ORIGINALITY IT ALSO PLEASES ONE BY ITS GREAT CLEARNESS
ALWAYS SAID THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS MORE EASY THAN TO SOLVE SUCH OBVIOUS QUESTIONS AND THAT HE COULD INTERPRET A THOUSAND OF THEM WITHOUT THE LEAST HESITATION WERE HE INCLIN'D TO TROUBLE HIS HEAD ABOUT SUCH TRIFLES
HE IMAGIN'D IT IS PLAIN THAT IT WOULD DO HIM MORE HONOUR THAN HIS OWN GREEN ONE UNACCOUTRED AS I AM I AM READY BEFORE THIS AUGUST ASSEMBLY TO GIVE THEM INCONTESTABLE PROOF OF MY SUPERIOR SKILL
THE PROPER DETERMINATION OF THESE RELATIONS RESTS ON THE QUESTION TO WHAT FACULTY OF COGNITION THEY SUBJECTIVELY BELONG WHETHER TO SENSIBILITY OR UNDERSTANDING FOR ON THE MANNER IN WHICH WE SOLVE THIS QUESTION
AND WITHOUT WHICH NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE WHICH IN A WORD DEVOURS EVERY THING HOW MINUTE SOEVER AND YET GIVES LIFE AND SPIRIT TO EVERY OBJECT OR BEING HOWEVER GREAT ITOBAD
WHICH SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT FOR INSTANCE DESIRE REPRESENT A COMPLEMENT OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS
SAID ZADIG I WAS THE PERSON THAT HAD THE HONOUR OF BEING VICTOR AT YOUR CIRCUS THE WHITE ARMOUR MOST PUISSANT LORDS WAS MINE THAT AWKWARD WARRIOR THERE LORD ITOBAD DRESS'D HIMSELF IN IT WHILST I WAS ASLEEP
ALL IN GENERAL WERE LAVISH OF THEIR PRAISES AND IN THEIR HEARTS WISH'D HIM THEIR SOVEREIGN EXCEPT THE ENVIOUS MAN WHO AS HE PASS'D BY FETCH'D A DEEP SIGH AND TURN'D HIS HEAD ASIDE THE POPULACE
SHE COULDN'T CONCEIVE WHY ZADIG SHOULD APPEAR WITHOUT HIS ACCOUTREMENTS NOR IMAGINE WHICH WAY ITOBAD COULD PROCURE THE SNOW WHITE ARMOUR AT THE SIGHT OF ZADIG A CONFUS'D MURMUR RAN THRO THE WHOLE PLACE
OPPOSITION BETWEEN REALITIES IS INCOGITABLE SUCH A RELATION THAT IS
OUR SENTIMENTS OUR EMOTIONS AND OUR PASSIONS IT IS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED THAT THESE STATES ARE OF A MENTAL NATURE
AND NOBODY SCREWED UP HIGH ENOUGH TO OFFER THE FIRST BLOW SILVER NEVER MOVED HE WATCHED THEM VERY UPRIGHT ON HIS CRUTCH AND LOOKED AS COOL AS EVER I SAW HIM HE WAS BRAVE AND NO MISTAKE
WAS WORK NO SOUND MAN EVER EQUALLED AND SO THINKS THE DOCTOR AS IT WAS HE WAS ALREADY THIRTY YARDS BEHIND US AND ON THE VERGE OF STRANGLING WHEN WE REACHED THE BROW OF THE SLOPE DOCTOR HE HAILED SEE THERE
EVERY THOUGHT OF HIS SOUL HAD BEEN SET FULL STRETCH LIKE A RACER ON THAT MONEY WELL HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A SINGLE SECOND DEAD AND HE KEPT HIS HEAD FOUND HIS TEMPER AND CHANGED HIS PLAN BEFORE THE OTHERS HAD HAD TIME TO REALIZE THE DISAPPOINTMENT
THE PRINTED SIDE HAD BEEN BLACKENED WITH WOOD ASH WHICH ALREADY BEGAN TO COME OFF AND SOIL MY FINGERS ON THE BLANK SIDE HAD BEEN WRITTEN WITH THE SAME MATERIAL THE ONE WORD DEPPOSED
AND THE WORST DREAMS THAT EVER I HAVE ARE WHEN I HEAR THE SURF BOOMING ABOUT ITS COASTS OR START UPRIGHT IN BED WITH THE SHARP VOICE OF CAPTAIN FLINT STILL RINGING IN MY EARS
TWO GUINEAS ROARED MERRY SHAKING IT AT SILVER
BEN BEN MURMURED SILVER TO THINK AS YOU'VE DONE ME THE DOCTOR SENT BACK GRAY FOR ONE OF THE PICK AXES DESERTED IN THEIR FLIGHT BY THE MUTINEERS
THE COUNCIL OF BUCCANEERS HAD LASTED SOME TIME WHEN ONE OF THEM RE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND WITH A REPETITION OF THE SAME SALUTE WHICH HAD IN MY EYES AN IRONICAL AIR BEGGED FOR A MOMENT'S LOAN OF THE TORCH SILVER BRIEFLY AGREED
THAT MAN WITH THE ONE LEG HAD STAYED ABOARD BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE SEA COOK HAD NOT GONE EMPTY HANDED HE HAD CUT THROUGH A BULKHEAD UNOBSERVED AND HAD REMOVED ONE OF THE SACKS OF COIN
WHERE HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT ON GUARD A GENTLE SLOPE RAN UP FROM THE BEACH TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE AT THE TOP THE SQUIRE MET US
THE APPEARANCE OF THE CHART WAS INCREDIBLE TO THE SURVIVING MUTINEERS THEY LEAPED UPON IT LIKE CATS UPON A MOUSE IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND ONE TEARING IT FROM ANOTHER AND BY THE OATHS AND THE CRIES AND THE CHILDISH LAUGHTER WITH WHICH THEY ACCOMPANIED THEIR EXAMINATION
AND PERHAPS STILL LIVES IN COMFORT WITH HER AND CAPTAIN FLINT IT IS TO BE HOPED SO I SUPPOSE FOR HIS CHANCES OF COMFORT IN ANOTHER WORLD ARE VERY SMALL THE BAR SILVER
IT WAS LONG ERE I COULD CLOSE AN EYE AND HEAVEN KNOWS I HAD MATTER ENOUGH FOR THOUGHT IN THE MAN WHOM I HAD SLAIN THAT AFTERNOON
A BIBLE WITH A BIT CUT OUT RETURNED SILVER DERISIVELY NOT IT
ONE HELD THE LIGHT ANOTHER WAS ON HIS KNEES IN THEIR MIDST AND I SAW THE BLADE OF AN OPEN KNIFE SHINE IN HIS HAND WITH VARYING COLOURS IN THE MOON AND TORCHLIGHT
I COULD JUST MAKE OUT THAT HE HAD A BOOK AS WELL AS A KNIFE IN HIS HAND AND WAS STILL WONDERING HOW ANYTHING SO INCONGRUOUS HAD COME IN THEIR POSSESSION WHEN THE KNEELING FIGURE ROSE ONCE MORE TO HIS FEET
NEARLY EVERY VARIETY OF MONEY IN THE WORLD MUST I THINK HAVE FOUND A PLACE IN THAT COLLECTION AND FOR NUMBER I AM SURE THEY WERE LIKE AUTUMN LEAVES SO THAT MY BACK ACHED WITH STOOPING AND MY FINGERS WITH SORTING THEM OUT
HAD BEEN DISPATCHED IN FRONT TO DO HIS BEST ALONE THEN IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORK UPON THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS FORMER SHIPMATES
AND A FIGURE STANDING BY IT LEANING ON A MUSKET IT WAS THE SQUIRE AND WE WAVED A HANDKERCHIEF AND GAVE HIM THREE CHEERS IN WHICH THE VOICE OF SILVER JOINED AS HEARTILY AS ANY THREE MILES FARTHER JUST INSIDE THE MOUTH OF NORTH INLET
A FEW MEDICINES AND SOME OTHER NECESSARIES TOOLS CLOTHING A SPARE SAIL A FATHOM OR TWO OF ROPE AND BY THE PARTICULAR DESIRE OF THE DOCTOR A HANDSOME PRESENT OF TOBACCO THAT WAS ABOUT OUR LAST DOING ON THE ISLAND
WHO'S THAT SAYS ONE THAT WHY THAT'S JOHN SILVER I KNOWED HIM WELL SAYS ANOTHER AND YOU CAN HEAR THE CHAINS A JANGLE AS YOU GO ABOUT AND REACH FOR THE OTHER BUOY
A COUNCIL WAS HELD AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE MUST DESERT THEM ON THE ISLAND TO THE HUGE GLEE I MUST SAY OF BEN GUNN AND WITH THE STRONG APPROVAL OF GRAY WE LEFT A GOOD STOCK OF POWDER AND SHOT THE BULK OF THE SALT GOAT
FOR I HAD SEEN HIM MEDITATING A FRESH TREACHERY UPON THE PLATEAU ACCORDINGLY IT WAS PRETTY GRUFFLY THAT THE DOCTOR ANSWERED HIM DRUNK OR RAVING SAID HE RIGHT YOU WERE SIR REPLIED SILVER
KILL THAT BOY NOT ME MATES AND NUMBER THREE AH WELL THERE'S A DEAL TO SAY TO NUMBER THREE MAYBE YOU DON'T COUNT IT NOTHING TO HAVE A REAL COLLEGE DOCTOR TO SEE YOU EVERY DAY YOU JOHN WITH YOUR HEAD BROKE
THIRD YOU WOULDN'T LET US GO AT THEM UPON THE MARCH
NOW THAT'S ABOUT WHERE WE ARE EVERY MOTHER'S SON OF US THANKS TO HIM AND HANDS AND ANDERSON AND OTHER RUINATION FOOLS OF YOU
I HAVE THAT CURIOSITY BESIDE ME AT THIS MOMENT BUT NOT A TRACE OF WRITING NOW REMAINS BEYOND A SINGLE SCRATCH SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT MAKE WITH HIS THUMB NAIL THAT WAS THE END OF THE NIGHT'S BUSINESS
THE PICTURES OF ALL THE KINGS OF EUROPE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS STRANGE ORIENTAL PIECES STAMPED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE WISPS OF STRING OR BITS OF SPIDER'S WEB
BEFORE YOU COULD WINK LONG JOHN HAD FIRED TWO BARRELS OF A PISTOL INTO THE STRUGGLING MERRY AND AS THE MAN ROLLED UP HIS EYES AT HIM IN THE LAST AGONY GEORGE SAID HE
THE WIND BROUGHT US A NOISE BETWEEN SHRIEKING AND SINGING IT WAS ONLY A SNATCH THAT REACHED OUR EARS FOLLOWED BY THE FORMER SILENCE HEAVEN FORGIVE THEM SAID THE DOCTOR TIS THE MUTINEERS
AND NOW SHIPMATES THIS BLACK SPOT TAIN'T MUCH GOOD NOW IS IT DICK'S CROSSED HIS LUCK AND SPOILED HIS BIBLE AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL IT'LL DO TO KISS THE BOOK ON STILL WON'T IT GROWLED DICK WHO WAS EVIDENTLY
AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
BUT WERE AT SEA WITH IT BESIDES IN SAFETY YES SAID ONE THAT'S FLINT SURE ENOUGH J F AND A SCORE BELOW WITH A CLOVE HITCH TO IT SO HE DONE EVER
AND THE WHOLE PARTY BEGAN TO MOVE TOGETHER TOWARDS THE HOUSE HERE THEY COME SAID I AND I RETURNED TO MY FORMER POSITION FOR IT SEEMED BENEATH MY DIGNITY THAT THEY SHOULD FIND ME WATCHING THEM WELL LET EM COME LAD LET EM COME
ARE WE A GOING TO WASTE A HOSTAGE NO NOT US
YOU'RE A FUNNY MAN BY YOUR ACCOUNT BUT YOU'RE OVER NOW AND YOU'LL MAYBE STEP DOWN OFF THAT BARREL AND HELP VOTE I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU KNOWED THE RULES RETURNED SILVER CONTEMPTUOUSLY
INDEED IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW WELL HE BORE THESE SLIGHTS AND WITH WHAT UNWEARYING POLITENESS HE KEPT ON TRYING TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH ALL YET I THINK NONE TREATED HIM BETTER THAN A DOG UNLESS IT WAS BEN GUNN
NO HURRY SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS NO HURRY IN A MORE OPEN PART OF THE PLATEAU WE COULD SEE THE THREE SURVIVORS STILL RUNNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THEY HAD STARTED
AND THE TREASURE IN THE HOLD OF HER BY THUNDER WELL WHO CROSSED ME
DARTING FURIOUS GLANCES BEHIND THEM ONE THING I OBSERVED WHICH LOOKED WELL FOR US THEY ALL GOT OUT UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE FROM SILVER WELL THERE WE STOOD TWO ON ONE SIDE FIVE ON THE OTHER THE PIT BETWEEN US
SILVER WAS GONE THE MAROON HAD CONNIVED AT HIS ESCAPE IN A SHORE BOAT SOME HOURS AGO
THEREFORE THE WORK WAS PUSHED ON BRISKLY GRAY AND BEN GUNN CAME AND WENT WITH THE BOAT WHILE THE REST DURING THEIR ABSENCES
AND THE ARMS STILL LIE FOR ALL THAT I KNOW WHERE FLINT BURIED THEM AND CERTAINLY THEY SHALL LIE THERE FOR ME
HE HAD CARRIED IT ON HIS BACK IN MANY WEARY JOURNEYS FROM THE FOOT OF THE TALL PINE TO A CAVE HE HAD ON THE TWO POINTED HILL AT THE NORTH EAST ANGLE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IT HAD LAIN STORED IN SAFETY SINCE TWO MONTHS
WELL WHAT IS IT ANYWAY AH DEPOSED' THAT'S IT IS IT VERY PRETTY WROTE TO BE SURE LIKE PRINT I SWEAR YOUR HAND O WRITE GEORGE
AND ABOVE ALL IN THE REMARKABLE GAME THAT I SAW SILVER NOW ENGAGED UPON KEEPING THE MUTINEERS TOGETHER WITH ONE HAND AND GRASPING WITH THE OTHER AFTER EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HIS PEACE AND SAVE HIS MISERABLE LIFE
ANOTHER ANCHOR WAS GOT READY AND DROPPED IN A FATHOM AND A HALF OF WATER WE ALL PULLED ROUND AGAIN TO RUM COVE THE NEAREST POINT FOR BEN GUNN'S TREASURE HOUSE AND THEN GRAY SINGLE HANDED RETURNED WITH THE GIG TO THE HISPANIOLA
HOW MANY IT HAD COST IN THE AMASSING WHAT BLOOD AND SORROW WHAT GOOD SHIPS SCUTTLED ON THE DEEP WHAT BRAVE MEN WALKING THE PLANK BLINDFOLD WHAT SHOT OF CANNON WHAT SHAME AND LIES AND CRUELTY
YOU'LL BE CAP'N NEXT I SHOULDN'T WONDER JUST OBLIGE ME WITH THAT TORCH AGAIN WILL YOU THIS PIPE DON'T DRAW
HERE IS A NARROW CORNER AS
AH IT'S A FINE DANCE I'M WITH YOU THERE AND LOOKS MIGHTY LIKE A HORNPIPE IN A ROPE'S END AT EXECUTION DOCK BY LONDON TOWN IT DOES BUT WHO DONE IT WHY IT WAS ANDERSON AND HANDS AND YOU GEORGE MERRY
AT LAST MERRY SEEMED TO THINK A SPEECH MIGHT HELP MATTERS
AND THERE WE SAW ALL THREE OF THEM KNEELING TOGETHER ON A SPIT OF SAND WITH THEIR ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION IT WENT TO ALL OUR HEARTS I THINK TO LEAVE THEM IN THAT WRETCHED STATE BUT WE COULD NOT RISK ANOTHER MUTINY
LEAPT TO HIS FEET WITH A HOARSE CRY WHIPPED HIS MUSKET TO HIS SHOULDER AND SENT A SHOT WHISTLING OVER SILVER'S HEAD
WHO WAS STILL TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS OLD QUARTERMASTER OR MYSELF WHO HAD REALLY SOMETHING TO THANK HIM FOR ALTHOUGH FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE I HAD REASON TO THINK EVEN WORSE OF HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE
HE HIMSELF SLEPT PEACEFULLY AND SNORED ALOUD YET
AND TO DIG WITH THEIR FINGERS THROWING THE BOARDS ASIDE AS THEY DID SO MORGAN FOUND A PIECE OF GOLD HE HELD IT UP WITH A PERFECT SPOUT OF OATHS IT WAS A TWO GUINEA PIECE AND IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND AMONG THEM FOR A QUARTER OF A MINUTE
AND KEEP A GUARD UPON THE MONEY AS FOR YOU JIM HE SAID IT WENT AGAINST MY HEART
ONE'S THE OLD CRIPPLE THAT BROUGHT US ALL HERE AND BLUNDERED US DOWN TO THIS THE OTHER'S THAT CUB THAT I MEAN TO HAVE THE HEART OF NOW MATES
WE WERE ALREADY BETWEEN THEM AND THE BOATS
AND PRECIOUS LITTLE ODDS WHICH TO YOU AND ME I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD HARDLY ASK ME TO CALL YOU A HUMANE MAN RETURNED THE DOCTOR WITH A SNEER AND SO MY FEELINGS MAY SURPRISE YOU MASTER SILVER
WE'LL ALL SWING AND SUN DRY FOR YOUR BUNGLING
AFTER THAT WE KEPT UNDER COVER OF THE BULWARKS AND WHEN NEXT I LOOKED OUT THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE SPIT AND THE SPIT ITSELF HAD ALMOST MELTED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE GROWING DISTANCE THAT WAS AT LEAST THE END OF THAT
AH MERRY REMARKED SILVER STANDING FOR CAP'N AGAIN YOU'RE A PUSHING LAD TO BE SURE BUT THIS TIME EVERYONE WAS ENTIRELY IN MERRY'S FAVOUR THEY BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE EXCAVATION
AND TO TAKE THEM HOME FOR THE GIBBET WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUEL SORT OF KINDNESS THE DOCTOR HAILED THEM AND TOLD THEM OF THE STORES WE HAD LEFT AND WHERE THEY WERE TO FIND THEM BUT THEY CONTINUED TO CALL US BY NAME AND APPEAL TO US FOR GOD'S SAKE
HESITATING AS HE SET DOWN EACH FOOT BUT HOLDING HIS CLOSED RIGHT HAND IN FRONT OF HIM STEP UP LAD CRIED SILVER I WON'T EAT YOU
AND AS IT WAS WHAT WITH BAFFLING WINDS AND A COUPLE OF FRESH GALES WE WERE ALL WORN OUT BEFORE WE REACHED IT IT WAS JUST AT SUNDOWN WHEN WE CAST ANCHOR IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND LOCKED GULF
PERHAPS NO MAN ALIVE COULD TELL YET THERE WERE STILL THREE UPON THAT ISLAND SILVER AND OLD MORGAN AND BEN GUNN WHO HAD EACH TAKEN HIS SHARE IN THESE CRIMES AS EACH HAD HOPED IN VAIN TO SHARE IN THE REWARD
SPEAK UP TO THE OTHERS AH THE OTHERS RETURNED JOHN THEY'RE A NICE LOT AIN'T THEY YOU SAY THIS CRUISE IS BUNGLED AH BY GUM IF YOU COULD UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT'S BUNGLED YOU WOULD SEE
ONE SIDE WAS BLANK FOR IT HAD BEEN THE LAST LEAF THE OTHER CONTAINED A VERSE OR TWO OF REVELATION THESE WORDS AMONG THE REST WHICH STRUCK SHARPLY HOME UPON MY MIND WITHOUT ARE DOGS AND MURDERERS
NOW I GIVE YOU WARNING GEORGE HE CRIED ONE MORE WORD OF YOUR SAUCE AND I'LL CALL YOU DOWN AND FIGHT YOU HOW WHY HOW DO I KNOW
GIVEN HIM THE STORES FOR BEN GUNN'S CAVE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH GOATS MEAT SALTED BY HIMSELF GIVEN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO GET A CHANCE OF MOVING IN SAFETY FROM THE STOCKADE TO THE TWO POINTED HILL THERE TO BE CLEAR OF MALARIA
SO THAT'S THE TOON IS IT CRIED THE COOK GEORGE I RECKON YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TURN FRIEND AND LUCKY FOR YOU AS I'M NOT A REVENGEFUL MAN BUT
AND BEFORE NOON TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE JOY THE HIGHEST ROCK OF TREASURE ISLAND HAD SUNK INTO THE BLUE ROUND OF SEA WE WERE SO SHORT OF MEN THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD HAD TO BEAR A HAND
IT WAS A LARGE AIRY PLACE WITH A LITTLE SPRING AND A POOL OF CLEAR WATER OVERHUNG WITH FERNS THE FLOOR WAS SAND BEFORE A BIG FIRE LAY CAPTAIN SMOLLETT AND IN A FAR CORNER ONLY DUSKILY FLICKERED OVER BY THE BLAZE
REPLIED LONG JOHN AGAIN SALUTING I DARE YOU TO THANK ME CRIED THE SQUIRE IT IS A GROSS DERELICTION OF MY DUTY STAND BACK AND THEREUPON WE ALL ENTERED THE CAVE
NOT A THOUGHT REPLIED DOCTOR LIVESEY CHEERILY AND BY THIS TIME WE HAD REACHED THE GIGS
BUT IF I WERE SURE THEY WERE RAVING AS I AM MORALLY CERTAIN ONE AT LEAST OF THEM IS DOWN WITH FEVER I SHOULD LEAVE THIS CAMP AND AT WHATEVER RISK TO MY OWN CARCASS TAKE THEM THE ASSISTANCE OF MY SKILL
I BEHELD GREAT HEAPS OF COIN AND QUADRILATERALS BUILT OF BARS OF GOLD THAT WAS FLINT'S TREASURE THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK AND THAT HAD COST ALREADY THE LIVES OF SEVENTEEN MEN FROM THE HISPANIOLA
CAPTAIN SMOLLETT IS NOW RETIRED FROM THE SEA GRAY NOT ONLY SAVED HIS MONEY BUT BEING SUDDENLY SMIT WITH THE DESIRE TO RISE ALSO STUDIED HIS PROFESSION AND HE IS NOW MATE AND PART OWNER OF A FINE FULL RIGGED SHIP
OH REPLIED GEORGE YOU DON'T BE UNDER NO KIND OF APPREHENSION WE'RE ALL SQUARE WE ARE FIRST YOU'VE MADE A HASH OF THIS CRUISE YOU'LL BE A BOLD MAN TO SAY NO TO THAT SECOND
TO ME HE WAS CORDIAL AND KIND SAYING NOTHING OF MY ESCAPADE EITHER IN THE WAY OF BLAME OR PRAISE AT SILVER'S POLITE SALUTE HE SOMEWHAT FLUSHED JOHN SILVER
COME IN JIM SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU'RE A GOOD BOY IN YOUR LINE JIM BUT I DON'T THINK YOU AND ME'LL GO TO SEA AGAIN YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF THE BORN FAVOURITE FOR ME
BUT THIS TOPS THE STIFFEST YARN TO NOTHING SILVER PAUSED AND I COULD SEE BY THE FACES OF GEORGE AND HIS LATE COMRADES THAT THESE WORDS HAD NOT BEEN SAID IN VAIN THAT'S FOR NUMBER ONE
CAME SLOWLY UP WITH US THANK YE KINDLY DOCTOR SAYS HE YOU CAME IN IN ABOUT THE NICK I GUESS FOR ME AND HAWKINS
AND LEAVING THE SQUIRE TO GUARD THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN GRAY AND THE MAROON AND STARTED MAKING THE DIAGONAL ACROSS THE ISLAND TO BE AT HAND BESIDE THE PINE SOON HOWEVER HE SAW THAT OUR PARTY HAD THE START OF HIM AND BEN GUNN BEING FLEET OF FOOT
MARRIED BESIDES AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY AS FOR BEN GUNN HE GOT A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE SPENT OR LOST IN THREE WEEKS OR TO BE MORE EXACT IN NINETEEN DAYS FOR HE WAS BACK BEGGING ON THE TWENTIETH
AS THAT OTHER SHIP THEY SANG ABOUT WITH ONE MAN OF HER CREW ALIVE WHAT PUT TO SEA WITH SEVENTY FIVE ALL OF US HAD AN AMPLE SHARE OF THE TREASURE AND USED IT WISELY OR FOOLISHLY ACCORDING TO OUR NATURES
MIGHTY PRETTY SAID GEORGE BUT HOW ARE WE TO GET AWAY WITH IT AND US NO SHIP SILVER SUDDENLY SPRANG UP AND SUPPORTING HIMSELF WITH A HAND AGAINST THE WALL
CRIED THE ACCUSED WIPING THE SWEAT FROM HIS BROW FOR HE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH A VEHEMENCE THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE
YOU'LL ALL SWING NOW I RECKON WHAT SOFT HEADED LUBBER HAD A BIBLE IT WAS DICK SAID ONE DICK WAS IT THEN DICK CAN GET TO PRAYERS SAID SILVER
HIS LOOKS WERE NOT QUITE FRIENDLY AND I WAS SO REVOLTED AT THESE CONSTANT CHANGES THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR WHISPERING SO YOU'VE CHANGED SIDES AGAIN THERE WAS NO TIME LEFT FOR HIM TO ANSWER IN
WE'RE THAT NEAR THE GIBBET THAT MY NECK'S STIFF WITH THINKING ON IT YOU'VE SEEN EM MAYBE HANGED IN CHAINS BIRDS ABOUT EM
TO PASS THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT HERE THEY MET THE CAPTAIN OF AN ENGLISH MAN OF WAR FELL IN TALK WITH HIM WENT ON BOARD HIS SHIP AND IN SHORT HAD SO AGREEABLE A TIME THAT DAY WAS BREAKING WHEN WE CAME ALONGSIDE THE HISPANIOLA
DON'T IT THOUGH CRIED DICK WITH A SORT OF JOY WELL I RECKON THAT'S WORTH HAVING TOO HERE JIM HERE'S A CUR'OSITY FOR YOU SAID SILVER AND HE TOSSED ME THE PAPER
THE TASTE OF THE TROPICAL FRUITS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIGHTS THAT BEGAN TO SHINE IN THE TOWN MADE A MOST CHARMING CONTRAST TO OUR DARK AND BLOODY SOJOURN ON THE ISLAND AND THE DOCTOR AND THE SQUIRE TAKING ME ALONG WITH THEM WENT ASHORE
BUT THAT'S A TRIFLE YOU LOOK THERE THAT'S WHY AND HE CAST DOWN UPON THE FLOOR A PAPER THAT I INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED NONE OTHER THAN THE CHART ON YELLOW PAPER
I MADE A HASH O THIS CRUISE DID I WELL NOW YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I WANTED AND YOU ALL KNOW IF THAT HAD BEEN DONE THAT WE'D A BEEN ABOARD THE HISPANIOLA THIS NIGHT AS EVER WAS EVERY MAN OF US ALIVE AND FIT AND FULL OF GOOD PLUM DUFF
WORTH PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED GUINEAS TO HELP HIM ON HIS FURTHER WANDERINGS I THINK WE WERE ALL PLEASED TO BE SO CHEAPLY QUIT OF HIM
I'M BEN GUNN I AM REPLIED THE MAROON WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL IN HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND HE ADDED AFTER A LONG PAUSE HOW DO MISTER SILVER PRETTY WELL I THANK YE SAYS YOU
YOU WANT TO PLAY BOOTY THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU AND THEN FOURTH THERE'S THIS HERE BOY IS THAT ALL ASKED SILVER QUIETLY ENOUGH TOO RETORTED GEORGE
ALL DRUNK SIR STRUCK IN THE VOICE OF SILVER FROM BEHIND US SILVER I SHOULD SAY WAS ALLOWED HIS ENTIRE LIBERTY AND IN SPITE OF DAILY REBUFFS SEEMED TO REGARD HIMSELF ONCE MORE AS QUITE A PRIVILEGED AND FRIENDLY DEPENDENT
AND THIS EMISSARY RETIRED AGAIN LEAVING US TOGETHER IN THE DARK THERE'S A BREEZE COMING JIM SAID SILVER WHO HAD BY THIS TIME ADOPTED QUITE A FRIENDLY AND FAMILIAR TONE I TURNED TO THE LOOPHOLE NEAREST ME AND LOOKED OUT
OF SILVER WE HAVE HEARD NO MORE THAT FORMIDABLE SEAFARING MAN WITH ONE LEG HAS AT LAST GONE CLEAN OUT OF MY LIFE
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH AN OVERTURN IN THIS WORLD EACH OF THESE SIX MEN WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STRUCK
HE'S SEEN HIS SLICE OF LUCK HAS DICK AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT BUT HERE THE LONG MAN WITH THE YELLOW EYES STRUCK IN
TWO OF THE BARS SLUNG IN A ROPE'S END MADE A GOOD LOAD FOR A GROWN MAN ONE THAT HE WAS GLAD TO WALK SLOWLY WITH FOR MY PART
THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGE SPUN ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM AND FELL ALL HIS LENGTH UPON HIS SIDE WHERE HE LAY DEAD BUT STILL TWITCHING AND THE OTHER THREE TURNED AND RAN FOR IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
AND YOU'RE THE LAST ABOVE BOARD OF THAT SAME MEDDLING CREW AND YOU HAVE THE DAVY JONES'S INSOLENCE TO UP AND STAND FOR CAP'N OVER ME YOU THAT SANK THE LOT OF US
WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WE GOT A FEW HANDS ON BOARD MADE A GOOD CRUISE HOME AND THE HISPANIOLA REACHED BRISTOL JUST AS MISTER BLANDLY WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF FITTING OUT HER CONSORT FIVE MEN ONLY OF THOSE WHO HAD SAILED RETURNED WITH HER
YOU'RE HIM THAT NEVER BUNGLED NOTHING YOU WOODEN HEADED LUBBER DIG AWAY BOYS SAID SILVER WITH THE COOLEST INSOLENCE YOU'LL FIND SOME PIG NUTS AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER PIG NUTS REPEATED MERRY IN A SCREAM MATES DO YOU HEAR THAT
THIS WAS A RUN OF EIGHT OR NINE MILES SILVER THOUGH HE WAS ALMOST KILLED ALREADY WITH FATIGUE WAS SET TO AN OAR LIKE THE REST OF US AND WE WERE SOON SKIMMING SWIFTLY OVER A SMOOTH SEA
AND PLAINLY MEANT TO LEAD A CHARGE BUT JUST THEN CRACK CRACK CRACK THREE MUSKET SHOTS FLASHED OUT OF THE THICKET MERRY TUMBLED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE EXCAVATION
SOMETIMES PLUNGING THROUGH THE BUSHES TO THE CHEST I TELL YOU BUT SILVER WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP UP WITH US THE WORK THAT MAN WENT THROUGH
BEN IN HIS LONG LONELY WANDERINGS ABOUT THE ISLAND HAD FOUND THE SKELETON IT WAS HE THAT HAD RIFLED IT HE HAD FOUND THE TREASURE HE HAD DUG IT UP IT WAS THE HAFT OF HIS PICK AXE THAT LAY BROKEN IN THE EXCAVATION
NO SAID THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE MAN TO KEEP YOUR WORD WE KNOW THAT WELL THAT WAS ABOUT THE LAST NEWS WE HAD OF THE THREE PIRATES ONLY ONCE WE HEARD A GUNSHOT A GREAT WAY OFF AND SUPPOSED THEM TO BE HUNTING
WHAT SHOULD WE MEET BUT THE HISPANIOLA CRUISING BY HERSELF THE LAST FLOOD HAD LIFTED HER AND HAD THERE BEEN MUCH WIND OR A STRONG TIDE CURRENT AS IN THE SOUTHERN ANCHORAGE WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND HER MORE OR FOUND HER STRANDED BEYOND HELP
THE EMBERS OF THE GREAT FIRE HAD SO FAR BURNED THEMSELVES OUT AND NOW GLOWED SO LOW AND DUSKILY THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHY THESE CONSPIRATORS DESIRED A TORCH ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE SLOPE TO THE STOCKADE THEY WERE COLLECTED IN A GROUP
YOU LET THE ENEMY OUT O THIS HERE TRAP FOR NOTHING WHY DID THEY WANT OUT
ONLY THE CAPTAIN LYING ON A MATTRESS IN THE STERN AND GIVING HIS ORDERS FOR THOUGH GREATLY RECOVERED HE WAS STILL IN WANT OF QUIET WE LAID HER HEAD FOR THE NEAREST PORT IN SPANISH AMERICA FOR WE COULD NOT RISK THE VOYAGE HOME WITHOUT FRESH HANDS
BUT CIVIL YOU CAN SPEAK AND SHALL GEORGE MERRY YOU MAY LAY TO THAT
I'VE STILL A SHOT IN MY LOCKER THE DOOR OPENED AND THE FIVE MEN STANDING HUDDLED TOGETHER JUST INSIDE PUSHED ONE OF THEIR NUMBER FORWARD IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COMICAL TO SEE HIS SLOW ADVANCE
AT LAST I THINK IT WAS ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE DOCTOR AND I WERE STROLLING ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WHERE IT OVERLOOKS THE LOWLANDS OF THE ISLE
THE THREE FELLOWS STILL ABROAD UPON THE ISLAND DID NOT GREATLY TROUBLE US A SINGLE SENTRY ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE US AGAINST ANY SUDDEN ONSLAUGHT AND WE THOUGHT BESIDES THEY HAD HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF FIGHTING
BUT PAPA WHAT DID YOU SAY TO SIR ABRAHAM ASKED THE LADY
AND SAID I AM SURE SUSAN WILL NOT ASK ME TO BREAK MY WORD OR TO DO WHAT I KNOW TO BE WRONG PAPA SAID SHE IT WOULD BE MADNESS IN YOU TO THROW UP YOUR PREFERMENT WHAT ARE YOU TO LIVE ON
COULDN'T CHARGE FOR HER BOARD AND WOULD HAVE TO GIVE ME HER SERVICES FOR NOTHING THAT WAS THE POINT OF VIEW I LOOKED AT IT FROM ECONOMY WITH A DASH OF LOVE I PUT IT TO MY MISTRESS AS IN DUTY BOUND
YOU KNOW YOU NEVER EXPECTED PAPA TO PAY THE COSTS SUCH ABSURDITY IS ENOUGH TO PROVOKE JOB SAID THE ARCHDEACON MARCHING QUICKLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM YOUR FATHER IS LIKE A CHILD EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR
THERE WAS PERHAPS A RAY OF COMFORT IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS MARRIED DAUGHTER THAT IS TO SAY OF COMPARATIVE COMFORT SEEING THAT HIS SON IN LAW WAS THERE
I NEVER KNEW YOU CRUEL BEFORE FATHER SHE SAID VERY GENTLY AND WENT OUT MY GIRL'S WORDS FELL UPON ME LIKE A SPLASH OF COLD WATER I WAS SAVAGE WITH MYSELF FOR FEELING
WHEN I WANTED TO GO UP STAIRS THERE WAS MY WIFE COMING DOWN
HAVING GOT OVER MY DIFFICULTIES WITH THE LADIES I FOUND MORE DIFFICULTIES WAITING FOR ME WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY OWN ROOM IN CAME PENELOPE WITH THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF WOMEN TO KISS AND MAKE IT UP AGAIN AND
THERE WAS A PAUSE FOR ABOUT A MINUTE AND THEN THE WARDEN FINDING THAT NOTHING ELSE WAS COMING LIGHTED HIS CANDLE AND QUIETLY SAID GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT PAPA SAID THE LADY
SOME SUCH IDEA AS THIS WAS ON HIS MIND BUT HE GAVE NO UTTERANCE TO IT THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE PELICAN FEEDING ITS YOUNG WITH BLOOD FROM ITS OWN BREAST BUT HE GAVE NO UTTERANCE TO THAT EITHER AND THEN OF ELEANOR
AS SHE DID WHEN SHE WENT DOWN TO MEET MISTER FRANKLIN IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE FOOTMAN'S REPORT WAS THAT THE PRESERVATION OF A RESPECTFUL COMPOSURE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS BETTERS AND THE WAITING ON MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AT DINNER WERE TWO OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO RECONCILE WITH EACH OTHER
BEING OLD AND SLY
IN THE CHARACTER OF LADY VERINDER'S HOUSE STEWARD ALL QUITE COMFORTABLE AND ALL THROUGH ROBINSON CRUSOE MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE HAS JUST LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR
FATHER SAYS PENELOPE QUITE SERIOUSLY THERE'S ONLY ONE EXPLANATION OF IT ROSANNA HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AT FIRST SIGHT
AGAINST THE INDIGNITY OF TAKING MY EASE AS I COULD BUT MY MISTRESS KNEW THE WEAK SIDE OF ME SHE PUT IT AS A FAVOUR TO HERSELF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN US ENDED AFTER THAT IN MY WIPING MY EYES LIKE AN OLD FOOL WITH MY NEW WOOLLEN WAISTCOAT
RESIGN THIS WARDENSHIP THEN MISTER HARDING THERE IS NOTHING BEFORE YOU BUT RUIN SAID THE ARCHDEACON NOW MOVED BEYOND ALL ENDURANCE
AND THAT HE PITIED THE CULPRIT THOUGH HE COULD NOT BUT BE HORRIFIED AT THE CRIME THE WARDEN ENDEAVOURED TO APPEAR UNCONCERNED AS HE SAID OH INDEED I'LL GO UPSTAIRS AT ONCE BUT HE FAILED SIGNALLY
TAKING UP A SIDE CANDLE AT ANY RATE YOU'LL PROMISE ME TO TAKE NO FURTHER STEP WITHOUT CONSULTATION SAID THE ARCHDEACON MISTER HARDING MADE NO ANSWER BUT SLOWLY PROCEEDED TO LIGHT HIS CANDLE
THE WARDEN LOOKED AT HIS DAUGHTER THINKING PROBABLY AT THE MOMENT THAT IF ELEANOR WERE CONTENTED WITH HIM
BUT SUSAN DIDN'T WANT TO GO TILL HER HUSBAND WENT SHE HAD AN IDEA THAT HER PAPA MIGHT BE BULLIED IF SHE WERE AWAY SHE WASN'T TIRED AT ALL
AND WENT ALL ROUND THE HOUSE AND THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY HAVING MADE SURE THAT NO PERSONS WERE LURKING ABOUT ANYWHERE IN OUR GROUNDS WE TURNED BACK PASSING OVER THE WALK WHERE I HAD SEEN THE SHADOW I NOW NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME
WITH THE NATURAL CURIOSITY OF WOMEN TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION THIS TIME SHE ONLY WANTED ME TO TELL HER
I SAID AND I THINK MY LADY IT WILL BE CHEAPER TO MARRY HER THAN TO KEEP HER MY LADY BURST OUT LAUGHING AND SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH TO BE MOST SHOCKED AT MY LANGUAGE OR MY PRINCIPLES SOME JOKE TICKLED HER I SUPPOSE
AFTER ALL OUR EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE DIAMOND EARLIER IN THE DAY HOW THE MEETING BETWEEN MISTER FRANKLIN AND HIS AUNT AND COUSIN WENT OFF IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL YOU I WOULD HAVE GIVEN SOMETHING TO HAVE WAITED AT TABLE THAT DAY
AND I HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF JUDGING AS YOU SHALL PRESENTLY SEE
THE EVENING CAME AND THE DRESSING BELL FOR DINNER RANG BEFORE MISTER FRANKLIN RETURNED FROM FRIZINGHALL I TOOK HIS HOT WATER UP TO HIS ROOM MYSELF EXPECTING TO HEAR AFTER THIS EXTRAORDINARY DELAY
BY THE TIME I HAD GOT TO THE CORNER THE TRESPASSERS WHOEVER THEY WERE
AND YOU WILL NOT DO THIS RASH THING THE LADY WAS REALLY MOVED BEYOND HER USUAL CALM COMPOSURE IT CAN NEVER BE RASH TO DO RIGHT SAID HE I SHALL CERTAINLY
MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE GOT IN MY WAY JUST AS HER LATE MOTHER USED TO GET IN MY WAY ON THE STAIRS AND INSTANTLY SUMMONED ME TO TELL HER ALL THAT HAD PASSED AT THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN MISTER FRANKLIN AND ME UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE ONE THING TO BE DONE
OF COURSE CONTINUED THE OTHER SUCH A DECLARATION AS THAT YOU MADE TO SIR ABRAHAM MEANS NOTHING COME WARDEN PROMISE ME THIS THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU SEE IS ALREADY SETTLED AND THAT WITH VERY LITTLE TROUBLE OR EXPENSE
I MIGHT HAVE HAD A CHANCE OF CATCHING THEM BEFORE THEY GOT CLEAR OF OUR PREMISES AS IT WAS I WENT BACK TO SET A GOING A YOUNGER PAIR OF LEGS THAN MINE WITHOUT DISTURBING ANYBODY SAMUEL AND I GOT A COUPLE OF GUNS
WILL TAKE CARE OF ME ALSO SAID MISTER HARDING WITH A SMILE AS THOUGH AFRAID OF GIVING OFFENCE BY MAKING HIS REFERENCE TO SCRIPTURE TOO SOLEMN PISH SAID THE ARCHDEACON TURNING AWAY RAPIDLY
HE MADE NO DISTINCT ANSWER TO THE ARCHDEACON'S LAST PROPOSITION FOR HIS MIND WAS CHIEFLY ENGAGED ON THINKING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE TO BED THAT HIS RESIGNATION WAS A THING FINALLY FIXED ON A FACT ALL BUT COMPLETED
BUT IN MY POSITION IN THE HOUSEHOLD WAITING AT DINNER EXCEPT ON HIGH FAMILY FESTIVALS WAS LETTING DOWN MY DIGNITY IN THE EYES OF THE OTHER SERVANTS A THING WHICH MY LADY CONSIDERED ME QUITE PRONE ENOUGH TO DO ALREADY WITHOUT SEEKING OCCASIONS FOR IT
AND OF COURSE I MUST NOW DO SO NOT AT ALL SAID THE ARCHDEACON CATCHING A RAY OF HOPE
HAD THEY HEARD ANYTHING OF EACH OTHER IMPOSSIBLE AGAIN I COULD SPEAK TO MISTER FRANKLIN'S ASTONISHMENT AS GENUINE WHEN HE SAW HOW THE GIRL STARED AT HIM PENELOPE COULD SPEAK TO THE GIRL'S INQUISITIVENESS AS GENUINE
IT'S TWELVE O'CLOCK YES MY DEAR SAID THE WARDEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL NAMED TEN FOR MY MEETING TO BE SURE TEN IS LATE BUT WHAT COULD I DO YOU KNOW GREAT MEN WILL HAVE THEIR OWN WAY
SAID THE WARDEN AND TO PREVENT THAT CONTINUED THE OTHER WE MUSTN'T LET ANY TALK OF RESIGNATION GET ABROAD BUT I SHALL RESIGN SAID THE WARDEN VERY VERY MEEKLY GOOD HEAVENS
WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO COMES ON A VISIT TO HER MISTRESS'S HOUSE MATCH ME THAT IN THE WAY OF AN ABSURDITY OUT OF ANY STORY BOOK IN CHRISTENDOM IF YOU CAN I LAUGHED TILL THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN MY CHEEKS PENELOPE RESENTED MY MERRIMENT
AND BEGAN TO DO SO BUT DOCTOR GRANTLY STOPPED HIM MY DEAR WARDEN SAID HE THIS IS ALL NONSENSE EIGHTY POUNDS OR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MAKES VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE YOU CAN'T LIVE ON IT YOU CAN'T RUIN ELEANOR'S PROSPECTS FOR EVER
ISN'T IT ASKED THE WARDEN INNOCENTLY WELL AT ANY RATE I'VE DONE IT NOW SIR ABRAHAM DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK IT SO VERY STRANGE THE ARCHDEACON GAVE A SIGH THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED A MAN OF WAR
DESCRIBING IT MERELY AS A VALUABLE OF GREAT PRICE AND HE HAD GOT THE RECEIPT FOR IT SAFE IN HIS POCKET I WENT DOWN STAIRS
WHILE IN TO MORROW'S HUMOUR AND THE THING WAS DONE MY MIND BEING RELIEVED IN THIS MANNER I WENT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT IN THE CHARACTER OF LADY VERINDER'S FARM BAILIFF
I WENT ON WITH MY BUSINESS AS BAILIFF YEAR AFTER YEAR UP TO CHRISTMAS EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN WHEN THERE CAME A CHANGE IN MY LIFE ON THAT DAY MY LADY INVITED HERSELF TO A CUP OF TEA ALONE WITH ME IN MY COTTAGE SHE REMARKED THAT
IS A REAL COMFORT AT STARTING IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD YOU HAVE HEARD TELL OF THE THREE BEAUTIFUL MISS HERNCASTLES MISS ADELAIDE MISS CAROLINE
WELL I HAVE DONE MY DUTY IF HE CHOOSES TO RUIN HIS CHILD I CANNOT HELP IT AND HE STOOD STILL AT THE FIRE PLACE AND LOOKED AT HIMSELF IN A DINGY MIRROR WHICH STOOD ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
I WAS LEFT WITH MY LITTLE GIRL PENELOPE AND WITH NO OTHER CHILD SHORTLY AFTERWARDS SIR JOHN DIED AND MY LADY WAS LEFT WITH HER LITTLE GIRL MISS RACHEL AND NO OTHER CHILD I HAVE WRITTEN TO VERY POOR PURPOSE OF MY LADY
CHAPTER TWO I SPOKE OF MY LADY A LINE OR TWO BACK NOW THE DIAMOND COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN OUR HOUSE WHERE IT WAS LOST IF IT HAD NOT BEEN MADE A PRESENT OF TO MY LADY'S DAUGHTER AND MY LADY'S DAUGHTER
IN POINT OF FACT YOU CAN'T RESIGN THE BISHOP WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT THE WHOLE THING IS SETTLED WHAT I NOW WANT TO DO IS TO PREVENT ANY INCONVENIENT TITTLE TATTLE ANY MORE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES THAT'S WHAT I WANT TOO
IN THIS BUSINESS OF THE DIAMOND HE HAD THE LONGEST TONGUE AND THE SHORTEST TEMPER OF ANY MAN HIGH OR LOW I EVER MET WITH I SAY I WENT INTO THE SERVICE OF THE OLD LORD AS PAGE BOY IN WAITING ON THE THREE HONOURABLE YOUNG LADIES AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN YEARS
EVERY WORD OF IT TRUE BUT SHE POINTS OUT ONE OBJECTION SHE SAYS WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR ISN'T IN THE LEAST WHAT I WAS WANTED TO DO
IF YOU REQUIRE TO BE TOLD THAT MY LITTLE PENELOPE WAS TAKEN CARE OF UNDER MY GOOD MISTRESS'S OWN EYE AND WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AND TAUGHT AND MADE A SHARP GIRL AND PROMOTED WHEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE MISS RACHEL'S OWN MAID AS FOR ME
AND ANGELS MIGHT HAVE BLUSHED AT THE REBUKE EXPRESSED IN HIS TONE AND EMPHASIS WHY DID YOU GO OFF FROM BARCHESTER SO SUDDENLY WHY DID YOU TAKE SUCH A STEP WITHOUT GIVING US NOTICE AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE PALACE
BUT PAPA SAID MISSUS GRANTLY GETTING UP
THERE I LIVED TILL MISS JULIA MARRIED THE LATE SIR JOHN VERINDER AN EXCELLENT MAN WHO ONLY WANTED SOMEBODY TO MANAGE HIM AND BETWEEN OURSELVES HE FOUND SOMEBODY TO DO IT AND WHAT IS MORE HE THROVE ON IT AND GREW FAT ON IT AND LIVED HAPPY AND DIED EASY ON IT
CAN BE IN ANY WAY BINDING ON YOU OF COURSE YOU WERE THERE TO ASK HIS ADVICE I'M SURE SIR ABRAHAM DID NOT ADVISE ANY SUCH STEP MISTER HARDING COULD NOT SAY THAT HE HAD I AM SURE HE DISADVISED YOU FROM IT
THAT IS MARRIED LIFE ACCORDING TO MY EXPERIENCE OF IT AFTER FIVE YEARS OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS ON THE STAIRS IT PLEASED AN ALL WISE PROVIDENCE TO RELIEVE US OF EACH OTHER BY TAKING MY WIFE
AND WERE HIDDEN FROM SIGHT AMONG THE THICK TREES AND BUSHES IN THAT PART OF THE GROUNDS FROM THE SHRUBBERY THEY COULD EASILY MAKE THEIR WAY OVER OUR FENCE INTO THE ROAD IF I HAD BEEN FORTY YEARS YOUNGER
HE DID NOT IN THE LEAST DOUBT HIS RESOLUTION BUT HE GREATLY DOUBTED HIS POWER OF DEFENDING IT AGAINST HIS SON IN LAW YOU MUST BE VERY TIRED SUSAN SAID HE WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO GO TO BED
IT WAS SO SILENT OUT OF DOORS THAT I HEARD FROM TIME TO TIME VERY FAINT AND LOW THE FALL OF THE SEA AS THE GROUND SWELL HEAVED IT IN ON THE SAND BANK NEAR THE MOUTH OF OUR LITTLE BAY AS THE HOUSE STOOD THE TERRACE SIDE WAS THE DARK SIDE
THAT HAD EVER TRIED HIS TRAINING IN SERVICE LATER IN THE EVENING WE HEARD THEM SINGING AND PLAYING DUETS MISTER FRANKLIN PIPING HIGH MISS RACHEL PIPING HIGHER AND MY LADY ON THE PIANO FOLLOWING THEM AS IT WERE OVER HEDGE AND DITCH
I CAN'T DO WITHOUT GABRIEL BETTEREDGE MY LADY SAYS SIR JOHN I CAN'T DO WITHOUT HIM EITHER THAT WAS HIS WAY WITH HER AND THAT WAS HOW I WENT INTO HIS SERVICE IT WAS ALL ONE TO ME WHERE I WENT
YOU HAVE HEARD OF BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADIES FALLING IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT AND HAVE THOUGHT IT NATURAL ENOUGH BUT A HOUSEMAID OUT OF A REFORMATORY WITH A PLAIN FACE AND A DEFORMED SHOULDER FALLING IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR MY LADY WHO WITH PAIN AND TRAVAIL PRODUCED HER INTO THE WORLD CONSEQUENTLY IF WE BEGIN WITH MY LADY WE ARE PRETTY SURE OF BEGINNING FAR ENOUGH BACK AND THAT LET ME TELL YOU
AND ON THE DINGY SOFA BEHIND HIM RECLINED HIS PATIENT WIFE
I ACCORDINGLY REPLIED THAT MISTER FRANKLIN AND I HAD BOTH TALKED OF FOREIGN POLITICS TILL WE COULD TALK NO LONGER AND HAD THEN MUTUALLY FALLEN ASLEEP IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN TRY THAT SORT OF ANSWER WHEN YOUR WIFE OR YOUR DAUGHTER
BOLD HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON HIS ACTION AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO REMAIN QUIET AT THE HOSPITAL MISTER HARDING STILL MADE NO REPLY BUT LOOKED MEEKLY INTO HIS SON IN LAW'S FACE
EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WITH THE HOUSE WITH NOTHING TO DO THE VERY PLACE FOR HIM
SHE HAD BEEN MERRY WITHOUT REASON AND SAD WITHOUT REASON IN ONE BREATH SHE ASKED HUNDREDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AND IN ANOTHER BREATH
WHAT IS ELEANOR TO DO IF YOU THROW AWAY YOUR INCOME A HOT TEAR STOOD IN EACH OF THE WARDEN'S EYES AS HE LOOKED ROUND UPON HIS MARRIED DAUGHTER WHY SHOULD ONE SISTER WHO WAS SO RICH PREDICT POVERTY FOR ANOTHER
THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO MY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AND NO DOUBT TO YOURS ALSO NOTHING HAD HAPPENED HE HAD NOT MET WITH THE INDIANS EITHER GOING OR RETURNING HE HAD DEPOSITED THE MOONSTONE IN THE BANK
WHICH WAS ONE REASON FOR MARRYING HER I HAD ANOTHER REASON LIKEWISE ENTIRELY OF MY OWN DISCOVERING SELINA BEING A SINGLE WOMAN MADE ME PAY SO MUCH A WEEK FOR HER BOARD AND SERVICES SELINA BEING MY WIFE
I AGREE WITH THE LATE WILLIAM COBBETT ABOUT PICKING A WIFE SEE THAT SHE CHEWS HER FOOD WELL AND SETS HER FOOT DOWN FIRMLY ON THE GROUND WHEN SHE WALKS AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT SELINA GOBY WAS ALL RIGHT IN BOTH THESE RESPECTS
AND SO I RESIGNED THE WARDENSHIP RESIGNED IT SAID THE ARCHDEACON IN A SOLEMN VOICE SAD AND LOW
A SORT OF WHISPER
I CAME ON A COMFORTING BIT PAGE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT AS FOLLOWS
I SAID NOTHING TO SAMUEL BUT REMEMBERING WHAT PENELOPE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE JUGGLERS AND THE POURING OF THE LITTLE POOL OF INK INTO THE PALM OF THE BOY'S HAND
THAT THE WAISTCOAT WAS NOT AN HONOUR BUT A BRIBE MY LADY HAD DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GETTING OLD
AND SEEING THEM SAFE THROUGH IT IN A MANNER MOST WONDERFUL AND PLEASANT TO HEAR THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS ON THE TERRACE AT NIGHT LATER STILL I WENT TO MISTER FRANKLIN IN THE SMOKING ROOM WITH THE SODA WATER AND BRANDY AND FOUND THAT MISS RACHEL HAD PUT THE DIAMOND CLEAN OUT OF HIS HEAD
THE ARCHDEACON WAS PACING THE ROOM EXPRESSING BY CERTAIN NODS OF HIS HEAD HIS OPINION OF THE UTTER FATUITY OF HIS FATHER IN LAW WHY AT LAST HE SAID
YOU HEAR MORE THAN ENOUGH OF MARRIED PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER MISERABLY HERE IS AN EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY LET IT BE A WARNING TO SOME OF YOU AND AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO OTHERS IN THE MEANTIME I WILL GO ON WITH MY STORY WELL
WHILE THEY WERE IN MY INTERESTING SITUATION AND THEY HAVE ALL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE IT HAPPENED THEY PRIVATELY WISHED THEMSELVES OUT OF IT I WENT A TRIFLE FURTHER THAN THAT MYSELF I ACTUALLY ROSE UP AS IT WERE AND TRIED TO GET OUT OF IT
THEY HAVE A SITTING ROOM ABOVE AND ARE WAITING UP FOR YOU THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE TONE OF THE MAN'S VOICE WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT EVEN HE LOOKED UPON THE WARDEN AS A RUNAWAY SCHOOLBOY JUST RECAPTURED BY HIS GUARDIAN
THE NEWS BROUGHT TO ME FROM THE UPPER REGIONS THAT EVENING CAME FROM PENELOPE AND THE FOOTMAN PENELOPE MENTIONED THAT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN MISS RACHEL SO PARTICULAR ABOUT THE DRESSING OF HER HAIR AND HAD NEVER SEEN HER LOOK SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY
TO THE DAY WHEN SHE RELIEVED HIM OF HIS LAST BREATH AND CLOSED HIS EYES FOR EVER I HAVE OMITTED TO STATE THAT I WENT WITH THE BRIDE TO THE BRIDE'S HUSBAND'S HOUSE AND LANDS DOWN HERE SIR JOHN SHE SAYS
NOT FOR NOTHING I WAS TOO JUST A MAN TO EXPECT SHE WOULD LET ME OFF FOR NOTHING COMPENSATION TO THE WOMAN WHEN THE MAN GETS OUT OF IT IS ONE OF THE LAWS OF ENGLAND
HOW IT WAS I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT WE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE
MY LADY GOT ME PUT UNDER THE BAILIFF AND I DID MY BEST AND GAVE SATISFACTION AND GOT PROMOTION ACCORDINGLY SOME YEARS LATER ON THE MONDAY AS IT MIGHT BE MY LADY SAYS SIR JOHN YOUR BAILIFF IS A STUPID OLD MAN
I RECEIVED THIS MAGNIFICENT PRESENT QUITE AT A LOSS TO FIND WORDS TO THANK MY MISTRESS WITH FOR THE HONOUR SHE HAD DONE ME
WAS ENTIRELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ONE OF MISTER FRANKLIN'S FREAKS BEING ASKED UPON THAT WHETHER HIS GALLOPING OFF AGAIN ON HORSEBACK WAS ANOTHER OF MISTER FRANKLIN'S FREAKS I SAID YES IT WAS AND SLIPPED OUT OF IT I THINK VERY CLEVERLY IN THAT WAY
UNDERSTANDING NOTHING MYSELF BUT THAT I WAS FREE TO PUT IT NEXT TO SELINA I WENT AND PUT IT ACCORDINGLY AND WHAT DID SELINA SAY
AND DEPEND ON THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF WOMEN FOR KISSING AND MAKING IT UP AGAIN AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY THE AFTERNOON WORE ON AND MY LADY AND MISS RACHEL CAME BACK NEEDLESS TO SAY HOW ASTONISHED THEY WERE WHEN THEY HEARD THAT MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE HAD ARRIVED
AFTER LEAVING MISTER FRANKLIN AND ME AT THE SHIVERING SAND ROSANNA IT APPEARED HAD RETURNED TO THE HOUSE IN A VERY UNACCOUNTABLE STATE OF MIND SHE HAD TURNED IF PENELOPE WAS TO BE BELIEVED ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
AFTER THAT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH ME OF COURSE I GOT THE NEW COAT AS CHEAP AS I COULD AND I WENT THROUGH ALL THE REST OF IT AS CHEAP AS I COULD WE WERE NOT A HAPPY COUPLE AND NOT A MISERABLE COUPLE WE WERE SIX OF ONE AND HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER
I OFFERED SELINA GOBY A FEATHER BED AND FIFTY SHILLINGS TO BE OFF THE BARGAIN YOU WILL HARDLY BELIEVE IT BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS TRUE
MY MIND BEGAN TO MISGIVE ME I HAVE COMPARED NOTES WITH OTHER MEN
THE ARCHDEACON THOUGHT HE KNEW HIS FATHER IN LAW BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ALREADY TALKED OVER A VACILLATING MAN TO RESIGN HIS PROMISE COME SAID HE PROMISE SUSAN TO GIVE UP THIS IDEA OF RESIGNING THE WARDENSHIP
A DOCTOR DOES WHEN RECOMMENDED BY AN OLD WOMAN TO TAKE SOME FAVOURITE DOSE OR AS A LAWYER WHEN AN UNPROFESSIONAL MAN ATTEMPTS TO PUT HIM DOWN BY A QUIBBLE I SHALL HAVE THE LIVING OF CRABTREE MODESTLY SUGGESTED THE WARDEN
WHEN SHE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT MISTER FRANKLIN THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN US CONDUCTED IN THIS WAY WAS TIRESOME ENOUGH UNTIL MY DAUGHTER SUDDENLY ENDED IT BY BURSTING OUT WITH WHAT I THOUGHT THE MOST MONSTROUS SUPPOSITION I HAD EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE
WHAT TO MORROW WE HATE I SAW MY WAY CLEAR DIRECTLY TO DAY I WAS ALL FOR CONTINUING TO BE FARM BAILIFF TO MORROW ON THE AUTHORITY OF ROBINSON CRUSOE I SHOULD BE ALL THE OTHER WAY TAKE MYSELF TO MORROW
BUT THE BROAD MOONLIGHT SHOWED FAIR ON THE GRAVEL WALK THAT RAN ALONG THE NEXT SIDE TO THE TERRACE LOOKING THIS WAY AFTER LOOKING UP AT THE SKY I SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON IN THE MOONLIGHT THROWN FORWARD FROM BEHIND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
EIGHTY POUNDS A YEAR SNEERED THE ARCHDEACON AND THE PRECENTORSHIP SAID THE FATHER IN LAW IT GOES WITH THE WARDENSHIP SAID THE SON IN LAW MISTER HARDING WAS PREPARED TO ARGUE THIS POINT
WITH A LITTLE COTTAGE OF MY OWN TO LIVE IN WITH MY ROUNDS ON THE ESTATE TO OCCUPY ME IN THE MORNING AND MY ACCOUNTS IN THE AFTERNOON AND MY PIPE AND MY ROBINSON CRUSOE IN THE EVENING WHAT MORE COULD I POSSIBLY WANT TO MAKE ME HAPPY
UNEASY IN MYSELF THE MOMENT SHE HAD SPOKEN THEM BUT SO IT WAS WE WILL CHANGE THE SUBJECT IF YOU PLEASE I AM SORRY I DRIFTED INTO WRITING ABOUT IT AND NOT WITHOUT REASON
WHEN I ENDEAVOURED TO LEAD THE CONVERSATION TO MORE SERIOUS THINGS TOWARDS MIDNIGHT I WENT ROUND THE HOUSE TO LOCK UP ACCOMPANIED BY MY SECOND IN COMMAND SAMUEL THE FOOTMAN AS USUAL
WITH A MOST POWERFUL SNEER COME ARCHDEACON SAID THE LADY
A LITTLE BRIGHT OBJECT LYING ON THE CLEAN GRAVEL UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE MOON PICKING THE OBJECT UP I DISCOVERED IT WAS A SMALL BOTTLE CONTAINING A THICK SWEET SMELLING LIQUOR AS BLACK AS INK
IN CASES OF DOUBT AND EMERGENCY I SMOKED A PIPE AND TOOK A TURN AT ROBINSON CRUSOE
AND HE GAVE HIS DAUGHTER A KISS AND SHOOK HANDS WITH THE DOCTOR AND AGAIN TRIED TO LOOK UNCONCERNED
THEN YOUR THREAT OF RESIGNATION AMOUNTS TO NOTHING AND WE ARE JUST WHERE WE WERE BEFORE MISTER HARDING WAS NOW STANDING ON THE RUG MOVING UNEASILY FROM ONE FOOT TO THE OTHER
CONTINUED THE REVEREND CROSS EXAMINER MISTER HARDING COULD NOT DENY THIS I'M SURE SIR ABRAHAM MUST HAVE ADVISED YOU TO CONSULT YOUR FRIENDS TO THIS PROPOSITION ALSO MISTER HARDING WAS OBLIGED TO ASSENT
WAS NOT IN HIS MIND A MATTER OF ANY DOUBT HE KNEW HIS OWN WEAKNESS HE KNEW HOW PRONE HE WAS TO BE LED BUT HE WAS NOT WEAK ENOUGH TO GIVE WAY NOW TO GO BACK FROM THE POSITION TO WHICH HIS CONSCIENCE HAD DRIVEN HIM
IN THE TIME OF THE OLD LORD I HAD BEEN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS IN HER SERVICE AND SHE PUT INTO MY HANDS A BEAUTIFUL WAISTCOAT OF WOOL THAT SHE HAD WORKED HERSELF TO KEEP ME WARM IN THE BITTER WINTER WEATHER
AND SO THE WARDEN RETIRED BUT AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE HEARD THE WELL KNOWN EJACULATION
AND SHE HAD COME TO MY COTTAGE TO WHEEDLE ME IF I MAY USE SUCH AN EXPRESSION INTO GIVING UP MY HARD OUT OF DOOR WORK AS BAILIFF AND TAKING MY EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AS STEWARD IN THE HOUSE I MADE AS GOOD A FIGHT OF IT
AND SAYING I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT THE PERTURBATION IN MY MIND IN REGARD TO THINKING ABOUT IT BEING TRULY DREADFUL AFTER MY LADY HAD GONE AWAY I APPLIED THE REMEDY WHICH I HAVE NEVER YET FOUND TO FAIL ME
ONE CANNOT HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL UP AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT FOR NOTHING BUT OF COURSE YOUR FATHER HAS NOT THOUGHT OF THIS I WILL SELL MY FURNITURE SAID THE WARDEN FURNITURE EJACULATED THE OTHER
EVER FIND THEIR OWN SELVES GETTING IN THE WAY OF THEIR SUBJECTS LIKE ME IF THEY DO I CAN FEEL FOR THEM IN THE MEANTIME HERE IS ANOTHER FALSE START AND MORE WASTE OF GOOD WRITING PAPER WHAT'S TO BE DONE NOW
WHEN ALL THE DOORS WERE MADE FAST EXCEPT THE SIDE DOOR THAT OPENED ON THE TERRACE I SENT SAMUEL TO BED AND STEPPED OUT FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR BEFORE I TOO
AND HAD GONE OFF AGAIN ON HORSEBACK NEEDLESS ALSO TO SAY THAT THEY ASKED AWKWARD QUESTIONS DIRECTLY AND THAT THE FOREIGN POLITICS AND THE FALLING ASLEEP IN THE SUN WOULDN'T SERVE A SECOND TIME OVER WITH THEM BEING AT THE END OF MY INVENTION
SAID THE LADY THE ARCHDEACON TOOK ANOTHER TURN AND AGAIN EJACULATED GOOD HEAVENS THIS TIME IN A VERY LOW WHISPER BUT STILL AUDIBLE I THINK I'LL GO TO BED SAID THE WARDEN
INSTEAD OF THAT I HAVE BEEN TELLING THE STORY OF MY OWN SELF CURIOUS AND QUITE BEYOND ME TO ACCOUNT FOR
ACTED UPON THE VERY QUESTION WHICH THE TEXT AFFIRMS THEY UNDERSTOOD JUST AS WELL AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW AND TWENTY ONE OF THEM A CLEAR MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE THIRTY NINE SO ACTING UPON IT
AND DOES NOT SUCH AFFIRMATION BECOME IMPUDENTLY ABSURD WHEN COUPLED WITH THE OTHER AFFIRMATION FROM THE SAME MOUTH THAT THOSE WHO DID THE TWO THINGS ALLEGED TO BE INCONSISTENT
AND PASSED AFTER THE ACT ENFORCING THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN SO THAT DURING THE WHOLE PENDENCY OF THE ACT TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WERE ALSO PENDING THE SEVENTY SIX MEMBERS OF THAT CONGRESS
I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY WE ARE BOUND TO FOLLOW IMPLICITLY IN WHATEVER OUR FATHERS DID TO DO SO WOULD BE TO DISCARD ALL THE LIGHTS OF CURRENT EXPERIENCE TO REJECT ALL PROGRESS ALL IMPROVEMENT
THAT MAKES AN ISSUE AND THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS UPON YOU YOU PRODUCE YOUR PROOF AND WHAT IS IT
THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS ARE EVERYWHERE IN PARCELS BUT THERE NEITHER ARE NOR CAN BE SUPPLIED THE INDISPENSABLE CONNECTING TRAINS MUCH IS SAID BY SOUTHERN PEOPLE ABOUT THE AFFECTION OF SLAVES FOR THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES
BUT TO BE TOLERATED AND PROTECTED ONLY BECAUSE OF AND SO FAR AS ITS ACTUAL PRESENCE AMONG US MAKES THAT TOLERATION AND PROTECTION A NECESSITY LET ALL THE GUARANTIES THOSE FATHERS GAVE IT BE NOT GRUDGINGLY
I HAVE PURPOSELY OMITTED WHATEVER UNDERSTANDING MAY HAVE BEEN MANIFESTED BY ANY PERSON HOWEVER DISTINGUISHED OTHER THAN THE THIRTY NINE FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND FOR THE SAME REASON
PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY AND I MIGHT ALMOST SAY PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST HALF OF THE PRESENT CENTURY DECLARE THAT IN HIS UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION
ACCORDING TO THE PRACTICE OF OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE NOT ONE OF ALL YOUR VARIOUS PLANS CAN SHOW A PRECEDENT OR AN ADVOCATE IN THE CENTURY WITHIN WHICH OUR GOVERNMENT ORIGINATED CONSIDER THEN
BUT WHILE THE CONVENTION WAS IN SESSION FRAMING IT
IN BOTH DEEDS OF CESSION IT WAS MADE A CONDITION BY THE CEDING STATES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT PROHIBIT SLAVERY IN THE CEDED COUNTRY BESIDES THIS SLAVERY WAS THEN ACTUALLY IN THE CEDED COUNTRY
BUT THERE IS MUCH REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR UNDERSTANDING UPON THAT QUESTION WOULD NOT HAVE APPEARED DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THEIR TWENTY THREE COMPEERS HAD IT BEEN MANIFESTED AT ALL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADHERING RIGIDLY TO THE TEXT
THEY ALL PROBABLY VOTED FOR IT CERTAINLY THEY WOULD HAVE PLACED THEIR OPPOSITION TO IT UPON RECORD IF IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING ANY LINE DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION
PROPERLY FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY THE OTHER OF THE FOUR JAMES MC HENRY VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION SHOWING THAT FOR SOME CAUSE HE THOUGHT IT IMPROPER TO VOTE FOR IT
IN THAT CASE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY WERE ADMITTED TO THE SECRET AND YET ONE OF THEM IN HIS ANXIETY TO SAVE A FRIEND BETRAYED THE PLOT TO THAT FRIEND AND BY CONSEQUENCE AVERTED THE CALAMITY
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED IT TO PASS WITHOUT RECORDING THEIR OPPOSITION TO IT IF IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING IT VIOLATED EITHER THE LINE PROPERLY DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANY PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION
OR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION FORBIDS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES HE IS RIGHT TO SAY SO AND TO ENFORCE HIS POSITION BY ALL TRUTHFUL EVIDENCE AND FAIR ARGUMENT WHICH HE CAN
IN A MORE MARKED AND EXTENSIVE WAY THAN THEY DID IN THE CASE OF MISSISSIPPI THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PROVISION THEREIN MADE IN RELATION TO SLAVES WAS FIRST THAT NO SLAVE SHOULD BE IMPORTED INTO THE TERRITORY FROM FOREIGN PARTS
IN THIS CONGRESS THERE WERE SIXTEEN OF THE THIRTY NINE FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION THEY WERE JOHN LANGDON NICHOLAS GILMAN WM S JOHNNSON ROGER SHERMAN ROBERT MORRIS THOS FITZSIMMONS
THE ANSWER MUST BE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES THAT CONSTITUTION CONSISTS OF THE ORIGINAL FRAMED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND UNDER WHICH THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT FIRST WENT INTO OPERATION AND TWELVE SUBSEQUENTLY FRAMED AMENDMENTS
THE TRUE NUMBER OF THOSE OF THE THIRTY NINE WHOM I HAVE SHOWN TO HAVE ACTED UPON THE QUESTION WHICH BY THE TEXT THEY UNDERSTOOD BETTER THAN WE IS TWENTY THREE LEAVING SIXTEEN NOT SHOWN TO HAVE ACTED UPON IT IN ANY WAY
ELSE BOTH THEIR FIDELITY TO CORRECT PRINCIPLES AND THEIR OATH TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION WOULD HAVE CONSTRAINED THEM TO OPPOSE THE PROHIBITION AGAIN GEORGE WASHINGTON ANOTHER OF THE THIRTY NINE
NEED NOT NOW BE REPEATED I TAKE THESE THIRTY NINE FOR THE PRESENT AS BEING OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WHAT IS THE QUESTION WHICH ACCORDING TO THE TEXT THOSE FATHERS UNDERSTOOD JUST AS WELL
IN WHICH AT LEAST THREE TIMES AS MANY LIVES WERE LOST AS AT HARPER'S FERRY YOU CAN SCARCELY STRETCH YOUR VERY ELASTIC FANCY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SOUTHAMPTON WAS GOT UP BY BLACK REPUBLICANISM
AND ARE JUSTLY OPPOSED AND DENOUNCED AS SUCH MEET US THEN ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OUR PRINCIPLE PUT IN PRACTICE WOULD WRONG YOUR SECTION
AND IF THEY DID HOW THEY ACTED UPON IT HOW THEY EXPRESSED THAT BETTER UNDERSTANDING IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THREE YEARS BEFORE THE CONSTITUTION
WHICH PROVIDES THAT NO PERSON SHALL BE DEPRIVED OF LIFE LIBERTY OR PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW WHILE SENATOR DOUGLAS AND HIS PECULIAR ADHERENTS PLANT THEMSELVES UPON THE TENTH AMENDMENT
SUCH UNQUESTIONABLY WAS THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND THE TEXT AFFIRMS THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION BETTER THAN WE
EVERY REPUBLICAN MAN KNEW THAT AS TO HIMSELF AT LEAST
AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW BUT ENOUGH LET ALL WHO BELIEVE THAT OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE UNDERSTOOD THIS QUESTION JUST AS WELL AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW SPEAK AS THEY SPOKE
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CONGRESS ON TAKING CHARGE OF THESE COUNTRIES DID NOT ABSOLUTELY PROHIBIT SLAVERY WITHIN THEM BUT THEY DID INTERFERE WITH IT TAKE CONTROL OF IT EVEN THERE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
UPON THIS SENATOR DOUGLAS HOLDS THE AFFIRMATIVE AND REPUBLICANS THE NEGATIVE THIS AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL FORM AN ISSUE AND THIS ISSUE THIS QUESTION IS PRECISELY WHAT THE TEXT DECLARES OUR FATHERS UNDERSTOOD
TO ENUMERATE THE PERSONS WHO THUS ACTED AS BEING FOUR IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR TWO IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SEVENTEEN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE
BUT FULLY AND FAIRLY MAINTAINED FOR THIS REPUBLICANS CONTEND AND WITH THIS SO FAR AS I KNOW OR BELIEVE THEY WILL BE CONTENT AND NOW IF THEY WOULD LISTEN AS I SUPPOSE THEY WILL NOT
THAT FAULT IS PRIMARILY YOURS
AS THE FIRST THING TO BE ATTENDED TO INDEED SUCH CONDEMNATION OF US SEEMS TO BE AN INDISPENSABLE PREREQUISITE LICENSE SO TO SPEAK AMONG YOU TO BE ADMITTED OR PERMITTED TO SPEAK AT ALL NOW CAN YOU OR NOT
WE SHOULD DO SO UPON EVIDENCE SO CONCLUSIVE AND ARGUMENT SO CLEAR THAT EVEN THEIR GREAT AUTHORITY
AND WE COMMEND IT TO YOU TOGETHER WITH HIS EXAMPLE POINTING TO THE RIGHT APPLICATION OF IT BUT YOU SAY YOU ARE CONSERVATIVE EMINENTLY CONSERVATIVE WHILE WE ARE REVOLUTIONARY DESTRUCTIVE OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT
UNDERSTOOD WHETHER THEY REALLY WERE INCONSISTENT BETTER THAN WE BETTER THAN HE WHO AFFIRMS THAT THEY ARE INCONSISTENT IT IS SURELY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THE THIRTY NINE FRAMERS OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION
I DO NOT THINK A GENERAL OR EVEN A VERY EXTENSIVE SLAVE INSURRECTION IS POSSIBLE THE INDISPENSABLE CONCERT OF ACTION CANNOT BE ATTAINED THE SLAVES HAVE NO MEANS OF RAPID COMMUNICATION NOR CAN INCENDIARY FREEMEN BLACK OR WHITE SUPPLY IT
THE IDENTICAL OLD POLICY ON THE POINT IN CONTROVERSY WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WHILE YOU WITH ONE ACCORD REJECT AND SCOUT AND SPIT UPON THAT OLD POLICY AND INSIST UPON SUBSTITUTING SOMETHING NEW
THOSE WHO NOW INSIST THAT FEDERAL CONTROL OF SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORIES VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION POINT US TO THE PROVISIONS WHICH THEY SUPPOSE IT THUS VIOLATES AND AS I UNDERSTAND
AND ESPECIALLY FOR PERSISTING IN THE ASSERTION AFTER YOU HAVE TRIED AND FAILED TO MAKE THE PROOF YOU NEED NOT BE TOLD THAT PERSISTING IN A CHARGE WHICH ONE DOES NOT KNOW TO BE TRUE IS SIMPLY MALICIOUS SLANDER
BETTER THAN WE LET US NOW INQUIRE WHETHER THE THIRTY NINE OR ANY OF THEM
IN EIGHTEEN O THREE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PURCHASED THE LOUISIANA COUNTRY OUR FORMER TERRITORIAL ACQUISITIONS CAME FROM CERTAIN OF OUR OWN STATES BUT THIS LOUISIANA COUNTRY WAS ACQUIRED FROM A FOREIGN NATION
CANNOT STAND AND MOST SURELY NOT IN A CASE WHEREOF WE OURSELVES DECLARE THEY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION BETTER THAN WE IF ANY MAN AT THIS DAY SINCERELY BELIEVES THAT PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY
IF ANY MEMBER OF OUR PARTY IS GUILTY IN THAT MATTER YOU KNOW IT OR YOU DO NOT KNOW IT IF YOU DO KNOW IT YOU ARE INEXCUSABLE FOR NOT DESIGNATING THE MAN AND PROVING THE FACT IF YOU DO NOT KNOW IT YOU ARE INEXCUSABLE FOR ASSERTING IT
THIS ACT PASSED BOTH BRANCHES OF CONGRESS WITHOUT YEAS AND NAYS IN THAT CONGRESS WERE THREE OF THE THIRTY NINE WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION THEY WERE JOHN LANGDON GEORGE READ AND ABRAHAM BALDWIN
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE BY THE FIRST CONGRESS WHICH SAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AN ACT WAS PASSED TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN INCLUDING THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN THE NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY
WHETHER YOUR CLAIM OF CONSERVATISM FOR YOURSELVES AND YOUR CHARGE OF DESTRUCTIVENESS AGAINST US ARE BASED ON THE MOST CLEAR AND STABLE FOUNDATIONS AGAIN YOU SAY WE HAVE MADE THE SLAVERY QUESTION MORE PROMINENT THAN IT FORMERLY WAS
WILLIAM FEW ABRAHAM BALDWIN RUFUS KING WILLIAM PATERSON GEORGE CLAIMER RICHARD BASSETT GEORGE READ PIERCE BUTLER DANIEL CARROLL JAMES MADISON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA THE SUM OF THE WHOLE IS THAT OF OUR THIRTY NINE FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION TWENTY ONE A CLEAR MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD THAT NO PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY
AND I CONSIDER THAT IN THE GENERAL QUALITIES OF REASON AND JUSTICE YOU ARE NOT INFERIOR TO ANY OTHER PEOPLE STILL WHEN YOU SPEAK OF US REPUBLICANS YOU DO SO ONLY TO DENOUNCE US AS REPTILES OR AT THE BEST
NO GREAT WHILE AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION NORTH CAROLINA CEDED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE COUNTRY NOW CONSTITUTING THE STATE OF TENNESSEE AND A FEW YEARS LATER GEORGIA CEDED THAT WHICH NOW CONSTITUTES THE STATES OF MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA
BLOOD AND THUNDER AMONG THE SLAVES SLAVE INSURRECTIONS ARE NO MORE COMMON NOW THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS ORGANIZED WHAT INDUCED THE SOUTHAMPTON INSURRECTION TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO
WE KNOW WE HOLD TO NO DOCTRINE AND MAKE NO DECLARATION WHICH WERE NOT HELD TO AND MADE BY OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE YOU NEVER DEALT FAIRLY BY US IN RELATION TO THIS AFFAIR WHEN IT OCCURRED
IS IT NOT A LITTLE PRESUMPTUOUS IN ANY ONE AT THIS DAY TO AFFIRM THAT THE TWO THINGS WHICH THAT CONGRESS DELIBERATELY FRAMED
THE FACTS WITH WHICH I SHALL DEAL THIS EVENING ARE MAINLY OLD AND FAMILIAR NOR IS THERE ANYTHING NEW IN THE GENERAL USE I SHALL MAKE OF THEM IF THERE SHALL BE ANY NOVELTY
THERE WERE OTHER CONSIDERABLE TOWNS AND SETTLEMENTS AND SLAVERY WAS EXTENSIVELY AND THOROUGHLY INTERMINGLED WITH THE PEOPLE CONGRESS DID NOT IN THE TERRITORIAL ACT PROHIBIT SLAVERY BUT THEY DID INTERFERE WITH IT TAKE CONTROL OF IT
NOR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION
AS TO MAKE THEM GUILTY OF GROSS POLITICAL IMPROPRIETY AND WILFUL PERJURY IF IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION BETWEEN LOCAL AND FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES AND SWORN TO SUPPORT
WE RESISTED AND STILL RESIST YOUR INNOVATION AND THENCE COMES THE GREATER PROMINENCE OF THE QUESTION
THE FIRST TEN OF WHICH WERE FRAMED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE WHO WERE OUR FATHERS THAT FRAMED THE CONSTITUTION I SUPPOSE THE THIRTY NINE WHO SIGNED THE ORIGINAL INSTRUMENT MAY BE FAIRLY CALLED OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THAT PART OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT
IN THE LANGUAGE OF MISTER JEFFERSON UTTERED MANY YEARS AGO IT IS STILL IN OUR POWER TO DIRECT THE PROCESS OF EMANCIPATION AND DEPORTATION PEACEABLY
IT IS ALMOST EXACTLY TRUE TO SAY THEY FRAMED IT AND IT IS ALTOGETHER TRUE TO SAY THEY FAIRLY REPRESENTED THE OPINION AND SENTIMENT OF THE WHOLE NATION AT THAT TIME THEIR NAMES BEING FAMILIAR TO NEARLY ALL AND ACCESSIBLE TO QUITE ALL
LESS THAN EIGHT YEARS BEFORE WASHINGTON GAVE THAT WARNING HE HAD AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES APPROVED AND SIGNED AN ACT OF CONGRESS ENFORCING THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN THE NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY
REPUBLICAN DOCTRINES AND DECLARATIONS ARE ACCOMPANIED WITH A CONTINUED PROTEST AGAINST ANY INTERFERENCE WHATEVER WITH YOUR SLAVES OR WITH YOU ABOUT YOUR SLAVES SURELY THIS DOES NOT ENCOURAGE THEM TO REVOLT
THAT WE REPEL YOU BY SOME WRONG PRINCIPLE OR PRACTICE IF WE DO REPEL YOU BY ANY WRONG PRINCIPLE OR PRACTICE THE FAULT IS OURS
OCCASIONAL POISONINGS FROM THE KITCHEN AND OPEN OR STEALTHY ASSASSINATIONS IN THE FIELD AND LOCAL REVOLTS EXTENDING TO A SCORE OR SO WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AS THE NATURAL RESULTS OF SLAVERY
BUT HE HAS NO RIGHT TO MISLEAD OTHERS WHO HAVE LESS ACCESS TO HISTORY AND LESS LEISURE TO STUDY IT INTO THE FALSE BELIEF THAT OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WERE OF THE SAME OPINION
HAD UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IN PROGRESS TOWARD MATURITY THESE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND THIS ACT PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN ALL THE TERRITORY THE NATION THEN OWNED THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WERE INTRODUCED BEFORE
IT WILL BE IN THE MODE OF PRESENTING THE FACTS AND THE INFERENCES AND OBSERVATIONS FOLLOWING THAT PRESENTATION IN HIS SPEECH LAST AUTUMN AT COLUMBUS OHIO AS REPORTED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES SENATOR DOUGLAS SAID OUR FATHERS
FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES THUS THE TWENTY ONE ACTED AND AS ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS SO ACTIONS UNDER SUCH RESPONSIBILITIES SPEAK STILL LOUDER
INCLUDING SIXTEEN OF THE FRAMERS OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AS BEFORE STATED WERE PRE EMINENTLY OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THAT PART OF THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WHICH IS NOW CLAIMED AS FORBIDDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES
AND A PART OF IT AT LEAST IS TRUE A PLOT FOR AN UPRISING COULD SCARCELY BE DEVISED AND COMMUNICATED TO TWENTY INDIVIDUALS BEFORE SOME ONE OF THEM TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A FAVORITE MASTER OR MISTRESS WOULD DIVULGE IT
CONGRESS ORGANIZED THE TERRITORY OF MISSISSIPPI IN THE ACT OF ORGANIZATION THEY PROHIBITED THE BRINGING OF SLAVES INTO THE TERRITORY FROM ANY PLACE WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES BY FINE AND GIVING FREEDOM TO SLAVES SO BROUGHT
AS NO BETTER THAN OUTLAWS YOU WILL GRANT A HEARING TO PIRATES OR MURDERERS BUT NOTHING LIKE IT TO BLACK REPUBLICANS IN ALL YOUR CONTENTIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER EACH OF YOU DEEMS AN UNCONDITIONAL CONDEMNATION OF BLACK REPUBLICANISM
AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW IT IS THIS DOES THE PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION FORBID OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN OUR FEDERAL TERRITORIES
FOR WE SHALL GET VOTES IN YOUR SECTION THIS VERY YEAR YOU WILL THEN BEGIN TO DISCOVER AS THE TRUTH PLAINLY IS THAT YOUR PROOF DOES NOT TOUCH THE ISSUE THE FACT THAT WE GET NO VOTES IN YOUR SECTION IS A FACT OF YOUR MAKING
WHICH ACT EMBODIED THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT UPON THAT SUBJECT UP TO AND AT THE VERY MOMENT HE PENNED THAT WARNING AND ABOUT ONE YEAR AFTER HE PENNED IT HE WROTE LA FAYETTE THAT HE CONSIDERED THAT PROHIBITION A WISE MEASURE EXPRESSING IN THE SAME CONNECTION
OR EVEN TO YOURSELVES BRING FORWARD YOUR CHARGES AND SPECIFICATIONS AND THEN BE PATIENT LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR US DENY OR JUSTIFY YOU SAY WE ARE SECTIONAL WE DENY IT
BUT SO FAR I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE QUESTION MANIFESTED BY THE FRAMERS OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION IN AND BY THE ORIGINAL INSTRUMENT A MODE WAS PROVIDED FOR AMENDING IT
WHAT HAS BEEN WILL BE AGAIN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS IF YOU WOULD HAVE THE PEACE OF THE OLD TIMES READOPT THE PRECEPTS AND POLICY OF THE OLD TIMES YOU CHARGE THAT WE STIR UP INSURRECTIONS AMONG YOUR SLAVES WE DENY IT
NO LINE DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY NOR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION WAS VIOLATED BY CONGRESS PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY WHILE MISTER PINCKNEY
WHEN THEY FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE UNDERSTOOD THIS QUESTION JUST AS WELL AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW I FULLY INDORSE THIS AND I ADOPT IT AS A TEXT FOR THIS DISCOURSE
THE SLAVES WOULD SCARCELY KNOW THERE IS A REPUBLICAN PARTY I BELIEVE THEY WOULD NOT IN FACT
SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY BEFORE THE CONVENTION WHICH FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND HENCE IT IS NOT RECORDED THAT THE THIRTY NINE OR ANY OF THEM WHILE ENGAGED ON THAT INSTRUMENT EXPRESSED ANY OPINION ON THAT PRECISE QUESTION
DECLARED THAT IN HIS UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES I GO A STEP FURTHER
BRAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DECLARING THAT IN HIS OPINION HE UNDERSTANDS THEIR PRINCIPLES BETTER THAN THEY DID THEMSELVES AND ESPECIALLY SHOULD HE NOT SHIRK THAT RESPONSIBILITY BY ASSERTING THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION JUST AS WELL
AND AS I HAVE ALREADY STATED THE PRESENT FRAME OF THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE CONSISTS OF THAT ORIGINAL AND TWELVE AMENDATORY ARTICLES FRAMED AND ADOPTED SINCE
WE SHOULD THEREBY CEASE TO BE SECTIONAL YOU CANNOT ESCAPE THIS CONCLUSION AND YET ARE YOU WILLING TO ABIDE BY IT IF YOU ARE YOU WILL PROBABLY SOON FIND THAT WE HAVE CEASED TO BE SECTIONAL
OR SOME PROVISION OR PRINCIPLE OF THE CONSTITUTION STOOD IN THE WAY OR THEY MAY WITHOUT ANY SUCH QUESTION HAVE VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION ON WHAT APPEARED TO THEM TO BE SUFFICIENT GROUNDS OF EXPEDIENCY
ARE RESERVED TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY OR TO THE PEOPLE NOW IT SO HAPPENS THAT THESE AMENDMENTS WERE FRAMED BY THE FIRST CONGRESS WHICH SAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION THE IDENTICAL CONGRESS WHICH PASSED THE ACT ALREADY MENTIONED
NO ONE WHO HAS SWORN TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION CAN CONSCIENTIOUSLY VOTE FOR WHAT HE UNDERSTANDS TO BE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEASURE HOWEVER EXPEDIENT HE MAY THINK IT BUT ONE MAY AND OUGHT TO VOTE AGAINST A MEASURE
IN COMMON WITH OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE DECLARE OUR BELIEF THAT SLAVERY IS WRONG BUT THE SLAVES DO NOT HEAR US DECLARE EVEN THIS FOR ANY THING WE SAY OR DO
THE CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATION HAD BEFORE THEM THE QUESTION OF PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN THAT TERRITORY AND FOUR OF THE THIRTY NINE WHO AFTERWARD FRAMED THE CONSTITUTION WERE IN THAT CONGRESS AND VOTED ON THAT QUESTION
AND ACT AS THEY ACTED UPON IT THIS IS ALL REPUBLICANS ASK ALL REPUBLICANS DESIRE IN RELATION TO SLAVERY AS THOSE FATHERS MARKED IT SO LET IT BE AGAIN MARKED AS AN EVIL NOT TO BE EXTENDED
IF WE SHOULD LOOK INTO THEIR ACTS AND DECLARATIONS ON THOSE OTHER PHASES AS THE FOREIGN SLAVE TRADE AND THE MORALITY AND POLICY OF SLAVERY GENERALLY IT WOULD APPEAR TO US THAT ON THE DIRECT QUESTION OF FEDERAL CONTROL OF SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORIES
HIS HOPE THAT WE SHOULD AT SOME TIME HAVE A CONFEDERACY OF FREE STATES BEARING THIS IN MIND AND SEEING THAT SECTIONALISM HAS SINCE ARISEN UPON THIS SAME SUBJECT IS THAT WARNING A WEAPON IN YOUR HANDS AGAINST US
AND WHAT IS YOUR PROOF HARPER'S FERRY JOHN BROWN JOHN BROWN WAS NO REPUBLICAN AND YOU HAVE FAILED TO IMPLICATE A SINGLE REPUBLICAN IN HIS HARPER'S FERRY ENTERPRISE
THAT IF ONE MAN WOULD ENSLAVE ANOTHER NO THIRD MAN SHOULD OBJECT FANTASTICALLY CALLED POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY
THE SAME QUESTION OF PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORY AGAIN CAME BEFORE THE CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATION AND TWO MORE OF THE THIRTY NINE WHO AFTERWARD SIGNED THE CONSTITUTION WERE IN THAT CONGRESS AND VOTED ON THE QUESTION
WHICH HE DEEMS CONSTITUTIONAL IF AT THE SAME TIME HE DEEMS IT INEXPEDIENT IT THEREFORE WOULD BE UNSAFE TO SET DOWN EVEN THE TWO WHO VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION AS HAVING DONE SO BECAUSE IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING
SECOND THAT NO SLAVE SHOULD BE CARRIED INTO IT WHO HAD BEEN IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF MAY SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT THIRD THAT NO SLAVE SHOULD BE CARRIED INTO IT EXCEPT BY THE OWNER AND FOR HIS OWN USE AS A SETTLER
SOME OF YOU ADMIT THAT NO REPUBLICAN DESIGNEDLY AIDED OR ENCOURAGED THE HARPER'S FERRY AFFAIR BUT STILL INSIST THAT OUR DOCTRINES AND DECLARATIONS NECESSARILY LEAD TO SUCH RESULTS WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT
SOME OF YOU ARE FOR REVIVING THE FOREIGN SLAVE TRADE SOME FOR A CONGRESSIONAL SLAVE CODE FOR THE TERRITORIES SOME FOR CONGRESS FORBIDDING THE TERRITORIES TO PROHIBIT SLAVERY WITHIN THEIR LIMITS SOME FOR MAINTAINING SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORIES THROUGH THE JUDICIARY
PROPERLY FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY THIS TIME THE PROHIBITION BECAME A LAW BEING PART OF WHAT IS NOW WELL KNOWN AS THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN THE QUESTION OF FEDERAL CONTROL OF SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORIES
THUS SUBSTITUTING FALSEHOOD AND DECEPTION FOR TRUTHFUL EVIDENCE AND FAIR ARGUMENT IF ANY MAN AT THIS DAY SINCERELY BELIEVES OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE USED AND APPLIED PRINCIPLES IN OTHER CASES
AS IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING MAY BE SAID ON OUR SIDE DO YOU ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE NO THEN YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPLE WHICH OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE
THERE WAS SOME SUFFICIENT REASON FOR OPPOSING SUCH PROHIBITION IN THAT CASE THE CASES I HAVE MENTIONED ARE THE ONLY ACTS OF THE THIRTY NINE OR OF ANY OF THEM UPON THE DIRECT ISSUE WHICH I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER
WHILE THERE WAS NOT ONE NOW KNOWN
IN THE INSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ACTED UPON THE QUESTION BUT FOR WHAT REASONS THEY SO VOTED IS NOT KNOWN
ENFORCING THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN THE NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY NOT ONLY WAS IT THE SAME CONGRESS BUT THEY WERE THE IDENTICAL SAME INDIVIDUAL MEN WHO AT THE SAME SESSION AND AT THE SAME TIME WITHIN THE SESSION
IN LITHUANIA IN WHOSE EMPLOY HE WAS WAS THAT THE PHYSICIAN IN ATTENDANCE UPON HIM DEMETRIUS HAVING BEEN SOLICITED BY BORIS TO DESTROY HIM CONSENTED BUT INSTEAD OF DOING SO SUBSTITUTED THE BODY OF A SERF'S CHILD
I CAN GET NOTHING INTO YOUR HEAD YOU MUST GO FROM HENCE I WILL GIVE YOU INTO THE CARE OF A CELEBRATED MASTER WHO SHALL SEE WHAT HE CAN DO WITH YOU THE YOUTH WAS SENT INTO A STRANGE TOWN
NOT ONLY DID VOLDEMAR'S RELATIVES THE DUKE OF SAXONY AND THE PRINCES OF ANHALT AND THAT APPARENTLY CONTRARY TO THEIR INTEREST ACKNOWLEDGE THE WANDERER BUT THEY EVEN
FATHER I WILL GO IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE FOR HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MY BROTHER IS SURELY DEAD AND THE KINGDOM WILL FALL TO ME IF I FIND THE WATER THE KING WAS AT FIRST VERY UNWILLING TO LET HIM GO
AND SHE WELCOMED HIM JOYFULLY AND SAID IF HE WOULD SET HER FREE FROM THE SPELL THAT BOUND HER THE KINGDOM SHOULD BE HIS IF HE WOULD COME BACK IN A YEAR AND MARRY HER THEN SHE TOLD HIM
BUT WENT WITH HIS HORSE STRAIGHT OVER IT AND AS HE CAME TO THE GATE IT FLEW OPEN AND THE PRINCESS WELCOMED HIM WITH JOY AND SAID HE WAS HER DELIVERER AND SHOULD NOW BE HER HUSBAND AND LORD OF THE KINGDOM
THE VARIOUS MARKS BY WHICH HE MIGHT DECEIVE THE WORLD THUS RUNS THE STORY AS TOLD BY THE ADVOCATES FOR THE IMPOSTURE THEORY PRESENTLY IT WILL BE SEEN WHAT CAN BE SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE WHILST NOW
WHO SET OUT IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE BEFORE ME AND NEVER CAME BACK I HAVE SHUT THEM UP BY A CHARM BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS SAID THE DWARF BECAUSE THEY WERE PROUD AND ILL BEHAVED AND SCORNED TO ASK ADVICE
AND NOW THE OLD KING GATHERED TOGETHER HIS COURT AND ASKED ALL HIS KINGDOM TO COME AND CELEBRATE THE WEDDING OF HIS SON AND THE PRINCESS AND YOUNG AND OLD NOBLE AND SQUIRE
VISITORS ARRIVED WHO QUICKLY RECOGNIZED THEIR RESUSCITATED PRINCE WARTS WHICH THE LATE EMPEROR'S SON HAD HAD ON THE FOREHEAD AND UNDER THE RIGHT EYE WERE DISCOVERED WHILST ONE ARM BEING LONGER THAN ANOTHER
THEY WILL LET YOU PASS THEN HASTEN ON TO THE WELL AND TAKE SOME OF THE WATER OF LIFE BEFORE THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE FOR IF YOU TARRY LONGER THE DOOR WILL SHUT UPON YOU FOR EVER THEN
AND WHEN HE CAME HOME AGAIN AND HIS FATHER INQUIRED MY SON WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT HE ANSWERED DEAR FATHER I HAVE THIS YEAR LEARNT WHAT THE FROGS CROAK
MOREOVER ONE HISTORIAN SHOWS FROM CONTEMPORARY RECORDS
SAID THE PRINCE HAUGHTILY AND RODE ON BUT THE DWARF WAS ENRAGED AT HIS BEHAVIOUR AND LAID A FAIRY SPELL OF ILL LUCK UPON HIM SO THAT AS HE RODE ON THE MOUNTAIN PASS BECAME NARROWER
WHICH WAS A BRANCH OF THE ASCAGNE FAMILY THIS WAS A D THIRTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DAYS AFTER VOLDEMAR'S DEPARTURE HIS BROTHER JOHN DIED SUDDENLY NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT HE HAD BEEN POISONED
LEFT THE FOREST IN WHICH HE HAD LAIN HID FOR FEAR OF HIS FATHER'S ANGER AND SET OUT IN SEARCH OF HIS BETROTHED BRIDE SO HE JOURNEYED ON THINKING OF HER ALL THE WAY AND RODE SO QUICKLY THAT HE DID NOT EVEN SEE WHAT THE ROAD WAS MADE OF
WHEN HE CAME BACK THE FATHER AGAIN ASKED MY SON WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT HE ANSWERED FATHER I HAVE LEARNT WHAT THE BIRDS SAY THEN THE FATHER FELL INTO A RAGE AND SAID OH YOU LOST MAN
THUS RUNS THE COMMONLY ACCREDITED STORY BUT SUMMING UP LATER AND EQUALLY RELIABLE RECORDS THE FAVOURERS OF THE IDEA THAT IT WAS REALLY THE ELECTOR HIMSELF WHO REAPPEARED PUT THE CASE THUS
IT IS A PITY TO RIDE UPON THIS BEAUTIFUL ROAD SO HE TURNED ASIDE AND RODE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF IT BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE GATE THE GUARDS WHO HAD SEEN THE ROAD HE TOOK SAID TO HIM
AND FOUND THAT THE PATH WAS CLOSED BEHIND HIM SO THAT HE WAS SHUT IN ALL ROUND HE NEXT TRIED TO GET OFF HIS HORSE AND MAKE HIS WAY ON FOOT BUT AGAIN THE LAUGH RANG IN HIS EARS
THE GUARDS SAID HE WAS NOT THE TRUE PRINCE AND THAT HE TOO MUST GO AWAY ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND AWAY HE WENT NOW WHEN THE FULL YEAR WAS COME ROUND THE THIRD BROTHER
ON THE TWENTIETH OF JUNE SIXTEEN O FIVE THE ADVENTURER ENTERED MOSCOW IN STATE AMID THE ACCLAMATIONS OF BELIEVING MULTITUDES ON ENTERING THE CHURCH OF SAINT MICHAEL THE PSEUDO DEMETRIUS ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS
DWELT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN SAXONY WHERE HE HAD BEEN WELL INSTRUCTED AS TO THE FORMER LIFE AND FAMILY CONNECTIONS OF THE DECEASED ELECTOR AS WELL AS PUT IN THE WAY OF COUNTERFEITING ON HIS PERSON
AND BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT GO IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE AS IT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD SAVE HIM NO SAID THE KING I HAD RATHER DIE THAN PLACE YOU IN SUCH GREAT DANGER AS YOU MUST MEET WITH IN YOUR JOURNEY
AT LAST A LITHUANIAN JEW WAS SELECTED BY THE INSURGENTS WHO AIDED BY THE POLES
AND PUT THEM ON HIS OWN FINGERS IN ANOTHER ROOM
BOUNTIFULLY WITH GOODS AND MONEY AND RENDERED HIM EVERY ASSISTANCE TOWARDS DRIVING OUT LOUIS ALMOST ALL THE TOWNS AND CITIES ACKNOWLEDGED HIS AUTHORITY AND PROMISED OBEDIENCE TO HIS RULE
IVAN THE TERRIBLE OF RUSSIA HAVING MURDERED HIS ELDEST SON LEFT THE CROWN TO THE NEXT FEODORE A PRINCE SO FEEBLE IN BODY AND MIND THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY HAD TO BE COMMITTED TO THE CARE
WHICH HE ALSO TOOK FURTHER ON
A LITTLE UGLY DWARF WITH A SUGARLOAF CAP AND A SCARLET CLOAK AND THE DWARF CALLED TO HIM AND SAID PRINCE WHITHER SO FAST WHAT IS THAT TO THEE YOU UGLY IMP
THE EMPEROR LOUIS ACTING IN OPPOSITION TO ALL RIGHT SAVE THAT OF MIGHT INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE DULY RECOGNIZED PRINCE TO SUCCEED TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ELECTORATE AND INVESTED HIS OWN SON LOUIS WITH IT
WHEN THE SECOND PRINCE HAD THUS BEEN GONE A LONG TIME THE YOUNGEST SON SAID HE WOULD GO AND SEARCH FOR THE WATER OF LIFE AND TRUSTED HE SHOULD SOON BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS FATHER WELL AGAIN
AND TAUNTED HIM AS TO HIS BIRTH THE WRETCHED MAN COLLECTING HIS STRENGTH EXCLAIMED I AM YOUR CZAR THE SON OF IVAN VASSILIEVITCH WHEN HIS AGONY WAS TERMINATED BY A SHOT FROM AN ARQUEBUSS
THE HISTORY OF THIS ADVENTURER IS RENDERED MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING FROM THE FACT THAT SEVERAL AUTHORS HAVE TAKEN UP CUDGELS ON HIS BEHALF AND VEHEMENTLY ASSERT THAT HE WAS TRULY
AND THUS THE KINGDOM WAS ONCE MORE IN PEACE AND PLENTY IN THE SAME MANNER HE BEFRIENDED TWO OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASSED ON THEIR WAY WHEN THEY CAME TO THE SEA THEY GOT INTO A SHIP
UPON HIS DESTRUCTION ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF MAY SIXTEEN O SIX DEATH TO THE HERETIC RANG THROUGH THE STREETS OF MOSCOW THE EXCITED MOBS HEADED BY PRIESTS AND SHUISKI
NEVERTHELESS THE UNKNOWN PRODUCED A RUSSIAN SEAL BEARING THE NAME AND ARMS
BUT THIS MIRACULOUS INTERPOSITION DID NOT SATISFY EVERYBODY AND WHILST THE PARTIZANS OF THE LATE CZAR WERE AFFIRMING THAT A BODY HAD BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OCCASION THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS ROUSED TO A STATE OF FRENZY
ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO APPEAR BEFORE MY EYES I WILL SEND YOU TO A THIRD MASTER BUT IF YOU LEARN NOTHING THIS TIME ALSO I WILL NO LONGER BE YOUR FATHER THE YOUTH REMAINED A WHOLE YEAR WITH THE THIRD MASTER ALSO
LET ME LIVE AND I WILL CHANGE DRESSES WITH YOU YOU SHALL TAKE MY ROYAL COAT TO SHOW TO MY FATHER AND DO YOU GIVE ME YOUR SHABBY ONE WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE HUNTSMAN I AM SURE I SHALL BE GLAD TO SAVE YOU
THAT IF HIS SON WOULD COME BACK TO HIS COURT HE WOULD FORGIVE HIM MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS WAS EAGERLY WAITING TILL HER DELIVERER SHOULD COME BACK
THE MAN HE ASSERTED HIMSELF TO BE NOT ONLY AUTHORS INK BUT UNFORTUNATELY A GREAT QUANTITY OF HUMAN BLOOD WAS WASTED IN THE DISPUTE AND THAT TOO
AFTER LYING EXPOSED FOR SOME DAYS WAS UNCEREMONIOUSLY BURIED WITHOUT THE WALLS THEN DISINTERRED AND BURNT THE ASHES COLLECTED AND TO MAKE SURE OF NO FURTHER RESUSCITATION
A DISCONTENTED NOBLE WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN PARDONED FOR CONSPIRACY BROKE INTO THE PALACE HUNTED THEIR PREY FROM ROOM TO ROOM UNTIL ALREADY BLEEDING FROM A SABRE WOUND THE UNFORTUNATE VICTIM LEAPED OUT OF A WINDOW
AND LEFT HIS BROTHER JOHN THE FOURTH IN POSSESSION OF HIS ELECTORATE HE STARTED UPON HIS PILGRIMAGE ATTENDED ONLY BY TWO MEN HE SET OFF ON HIS JOURNEY WITHOUT INFORMING HIS BROTHER OR ANY OF HIS SUBJECTS
TAKING HER WITH HIM THEN HE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HOW HIS BROTHERS HAD CHEATED AND ROBBED HIM AND YET THAT HE HAD BORNE ALL THOSE WRONGS FOR THE LOVE OF HIS FATHER AND THE OLD KING WAS VERY ANGRY
HAD RECOGNIZED HER SON AND THE NEW MONARCH WAS MASTER OF THE SITUATION HE RESPECTFULLY CONDUCTED THE CZARINA TO A CARRIAGE WALKING BARE HEADED BY ITS SIDE IN THE CAPITAL HE TREATED HER WITH EVERY ATTENTION
SO HE SET OUT AND THE DWARF MET HIM TOO AT THE SAME SPOT IN THE VALLEY AMONG THE MOUNTAINS AND SAID PRINCE WHITHER SO FAST AND THE PRINCE SAID
DECLARED FOR THE CLAIMANT AS DID ALSO THE RULERS OF BRUNSWICK POMERANIA MECKLENBURG AND SEVERAL OTHERS INCLUDING VOLDEMAR'S RELATIVES THE DUKE OF SAXONY AND THE PRINCES OF ANHALT
AND NARROWER AND AT LAST THE WAY WAS SO STRAITENED THAT HE COULD NOT GO TO STEP FORWARD AND WHEN HE THOUGHT TO HAVE TURNED HIS HORSE ROUND AND GO BACK THE WAY HE CAME HE HEARD A LOUD LAUGH RINGING ROUND HIM
AND A VALUABLE JEWELLED CROSS THIS WAS IN THE SUMMER OF SIXTEEN O THREE WHEN DEMETRIUS IF LIVING WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT TWENTY TWO AN AGE APPARENTLY CORRESPONDING WITH THAT OF THE CLAIMANT TO HIS NAME
IN THE CHAPEL DU SAINT ESPRIT WHICH WAS THE GENERAL PLACE OF SEPULTURE
AND REMAINED A WHOLE YEAR WITH THE MASTER AT THE END OF THIS TIME HE CAME HOME AGAIN AND HIS FATHER ASKED NOW MY SON WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT FATHER I HAVE LEARNT WHAT THE DOGS SAY WHEN THEY BARK
IN DAILY HOPE OF HIS SON'S RETURN
AND IN A SHORT TIME ALMOST THE WHOLE EMPIRE DECLARED FOR HIM HIS REIGN HOWEVER WAS SHORT DESERTED BY HIS FOREIGN ALLIES HE WAS FORCED TO FLY AND EVENTUALLY WAS ASSASSINATED
WHAT ROUTE HE INTENDED TAKING OR INDEED FURNISHING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND RELATIVE TO HIS INTENTIONS VOLDEMAR AND HIS BROTHER JOHN WERE THE ONLY SURVIVING MEMBERS OF THE ELDER BRANCH OF THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE
TO BEHOLD THE MAN CLAIMING TO BE HER SON DEMETRIUS WENT TO MEET HER IN REGAL STATE AND THEIR FIRST INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE IN A MAGNIFICENT TENT SPECIALLY PREPARED FOR THE INTERESTING CEREMONY
IT WILL BE AS WELL TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED UPON THE APPEARANCE OF THE CLAIMANT THE RUMOUR OF VOLDEMAR'S RETURN FROM A LONG AND PAINFUL CAPTIVITY IN TURKEY
HE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN AN ABLE AND FORBEARING MAN BUT HE OUTRAGED THE NOBLES
NAMED JACQUES REBOC HE WAS THEY MOREOVER ALLEGE AN HABITUAL LIAR AND A CUNNING VAGABOND POSSESSING SOME RESEMBLANCE IN FORM AND FACE TO THE LOST PRINCE SUCH RESEMBLANCE INDEED
BUT HE BEGGED SO HARD THAT THE KING LET HIM GO AND THE PRINCE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF IF I BRING MY FATHER THIS WATER HE WILL MAKE ME SOLE HEIR TO HIS KINGDOM THEN HE SET OUT
INDEED AND THEIR DELIGHT AT BEING DELIVERED FROM THE DOMINION OF THE BAVARIANS WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEIR COUNTRY AFTER IT HAD BEEN FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS GOVERNED BY THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE THAT THEY FURNISHED THE SUPPOSED VOLDEMAR
TO THINK THAT HE HAD GOT THE WATER OF LIFE AND AS HE WAS GOING ON HIS WAY HOMEWARDS HE PASSED BY THE LITTLE DWARF WHO WHEN HE SAW THE SWORD AND THE LOAF SAID YOU HAVE MADE A NOBLE PRIZE WITH THE SWORD YOU CAN AT A BLOW
OF SAXONY AND BRANDENBURG VESTED IN ONE PERSON PRODUCED A CERTAIN MAN WHOM HE DOUBTLESS MEANT TO USE AS A TOOL THIS MAN HE DECLARED TO BE HIS DEAR COUSIN VOLDEMAR
AND WHEN THE LIONS WERE QUIETED HE WENT ON THROUGH THE CASTLE AND CAME AT LENGTH TO A BEAUTIFUL HALL AROUND IT HE SAW SEVERAL KNIGHTS SITTING IN A TRANCE THEN HE PULLED OFF THEIR RINGS
DEMETRIUS NOW SET TO WORK TO GOVERN WITH HUMANITY AND JUSTICE BOTH QUALITIES QUITE UNSUITED TO RUSSIAN TASTES WHO SOON GREW AS TIRED OF THEIR NEW CZAR AS THEY HAD BEEN OF HIS PREDECESSORS
LORD HAVE MERCY ON US CRIED THE FATHER IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE LEARNT I WILL SEND YOU INTO ANOTHER TOWN TO ANOTHER MASTER THE YOUTH WAS TAKEN THITHER AND STAYED A YEAR WITH THIS MASTER LIKEWISE
INTO THE COURT BELOW A HEIGHT OF THIRTY FEET HE BROKE HIS LEG IN THE FALL AND FAINTED THE INSURGENTS SPEEDILY FOUND HIM DRAGGED HIM MID CURSES AND BLOWS INTO THE PALACE
ONCE FELL VERY ILL SO ILL THAT NOBODY THOUGHT HE COULD LIVE HIS SONS WERE VERY MUCH GRIEVED AT THEIR FATHER'S SICKNESS AND AS THEY WERE WALKING TOGETHER VERY MOURNFULLY IN THE GARDEN OF THE PALACE
BUT PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE THE ROYAL PILGRIM OBLIGED HIS SUBJECTS TO SWEAR THAT IN THE EVENT OF HIM AND HIS BROTHER DYING CHILDLESS THEY WOULD RECEIVE FOR THEIR SOVEREIGN
OF HIS BROTHER IN LAW BORIS THIS BOLD AND UNSCRUPULOUS MAN ASPIRED TO THE THRONE BUT BETWEEN HIM AND THE IMBECILE WHO OCCUPIED IT STOOD DEMETRIUS ANOTHER CHILD OF THE LATE MONARCH
THAT HE WOULD REST HIMSELF FOR A WHILE AND GAZE ON THE LOVELY SCENES AROUND HIM
SLAY WHOLE ARMIES AND THE BREAD WILL NEVER FAIL YOU THEN THE PRINCE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I CANNOT GO HOME TO MY FATHER WITHOUT MY BROTHERS SO HE SAID MY DEAR FRIEND CANNOT YOU TELL ME WHERE MY TWO BROTHERS ARE
THE EMPEROR LOUIS WAS KNOWN MOREOVER TO HAVE ENTERTAINED GREAT HATRED AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ASCAGNE IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS CHIEFS RUDOLPH OF SAXONY AND VOLDEMAR THE FIRST UNCLE OF THE SECOND VOLDEMAR
SO HE CALLED HIS COURT TOGETHER AND ASKED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AND ALL AGREED THAT HE OUGHT TO BE PUT TO DEATH THE PRINCE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON TILL ONE DAY WHEN THE KING'S CHIEF HUNTSMEN WENT A HUNTING WITH HIM
THAT ENDURED FOR SOME YEARS NOW COMMENCED BETWEEN THE RIVAL ELECTORS BUT FINALLY VOLDEMAR INFLICTED SUCH A SIGNAL DEFEAT UPON HIS OPPONENT'S FORCES THAT LOUIS RELINQUISHED THE CONTEST IN DISGUST
AND RETIRED TO HIS DOMAINS IN THE TYROL MAKING OVER HIS CLAIM UPON BRANDENBURG TO HIS TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS THIS TRANSFERENCE OF THE ELECTORATE IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THE EMPEROR CHARLES AFTERWARDS
THAT THEY MIGHT CARRY THEM TO THE OLD MAN AS A TOKEN THE YOUTH WANDERED ON AND AFTER SOME TIME CAME TO A FORTRESS WHERE HE BEGGED FOR A NIGHT'S LODGING YES SAID THE LORD OF THE CASTLE IF YOU WILL PASS THE NIGHT
IN ORDER TO AFFORD A FAIR IDEA OF THIS PRETENDER'S CLAIMS IT WILL BE NECESSARY IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RECOUNT THE STORY OF HIS APPEARANCE AS DETAILED BY THE AUTHORS FAVOURING THE THEORY OF HIS BEING AN IMPOSTOR AND THEN
THEY RECEIVED HIM BACK WITH TRANSPORTS OF JOY SUCH WAS THEIR ENTHUSIASM
WITHOUT THE WORLD BEING ANY THE WISER THE FACTS AS THEY ARE RECOUNTED BY HISTORIANS STAND THUS VOLDEMAR THE SECOND MARQUIS OF BRANDENBURG WAS THE THIRTEENTH
AND BLAMED THE YOUNGEST FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND SAID THAT HE WANTED TO POISON THEIR FATHER BUT THAT THEY HAD FOUND THE WATER OF LIFE AND HAD BROUGHT IT WITH THEM HE NO SOONER BEGAN TO DRINK OF WHAT THEY BROUGHT HIM THAN HE FELT HIS SICKNESS LEAVE HIM
WHOM THEY AT ONCE DEVOUR THE WHOLE DISTRICT WAS IN SORROW AND DISMAY BECAUSE OF THEM AND YET NO ONE COULD DO ANYTHING TO STOP THIS THE YOUTH HOWEVER WAS WITHOUT FEAR AND SAID
WHEN THE FIRST JOY AT THEIR MEETING WAS OVER THE PRINCESS TOLD HIM SHE HAD HEARD OF HIS FATHER HAVING FORGIVEN HIM AND OF HIS WISH TO HAVE HIM HOME AGAIN SO BEFORE HIS WEDDING WITH THE PRINCESS HE WENT TO VISIT HIS FATHER
AFTER THEY HAD BEEN LEFT TOGETHER FOR A FEW MINUTES THEY CAME OUT AND THREW THEMSELVES INTO ONE ANOTHER'S ARMS IN THE FULL VIEW OF THE ENORMOUS MULTITUDE WHICH HAD ASSEMBLED
IN A STATE OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT TO SEE
THEY RECOGNIZED THE CORPSE AS THAT OF THE REAL PRINCE AND AFFIRMED THAT BY HEAVENLY PROVIDENCE IT HAD BEEN PRESERVED IN ITS THEN CONDITION IT BEING FOUND QUITE UNCORRUPT AND THE GLOW OF LIFE NOT EVEN FADED FROM THE CHEEK
YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR LIFE INTO THE BARGAIN BUT BE QUIET AND WE WILL LET YOU OFF
FOR I COULD NOT HAVE SHOT YOU THEN HE TOOK THE PRINCE'S COAT AND GAVE HIM THE SHABBY ONE AND WENT AWAY THROUGH THE WOOD SOME TIME AFTER THREE GRAND EMBASSIES CAME TO THE OLD KING'S COURT
HAD MURDERED BURNT AND FIRED FROM THE CANNON'S MOUTH THE WRONG MAN THIS TIME A SUBSTITUTED CORPSE COULD NOT BE PRODUCED A CIVIL WAR BROKE OUT
TO PRODUCE THE EVIDENCE OFFERED BY THOSE OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY ON HIS BEHALF THE RECEIVED OPINION IS THAT RUDOLPH
TO TAKE UP HIS ABODE IN THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAINS THUS IT IS WITH PROUD SILLY PEOPLE WHO THINK THEMSELVES ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE AND ARE TOO PROUD TO ASK OR TAKE ADVICE
A LITTLE OLD MAN MET THEM AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER THEY TOLD HIM THAT THEIR FATHER WAS VERY ILL AND THAT THEY WERE AFRAID NOTHING COULD SAVE HIM I KNOW WHAT WOULD SAID THE LITTLE OLD MAN
AND HE FOUND HIMSELF UNABLE TO MOVE A STEP AND THUS HE WAS FORCED TO ABIDE SPELLBOUND MEANTIME
ESPOUSED HIS CAUSE GEORGE THE PALATINE OF SANDOMIR GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE AND THE POPE OF ROME UPON HIS SECRET CONFESSION OF THE CATHOLIC FAITH SANCTIONED HIS PRETENSIONS THUS ENCOURAGED
SAID HE BUT THE PRINCE BEGGED VERY HARD AND SAID ONLY TELL ME WHAT IT IS AND DO NOT THINK I SHALL BE ANGRY FOR I WILL FORGIVE YOU ALAS SAID THE HUNTSMAN THE KING HAS ORDERED ME TO SHOOT YOU
THE ARCHBISHOP OF MAGDEBURG PRIMATE OF GERMANY A MAN TOTALLY UNINTERESTED EITHER WAY AND KNOWN FOR HIS PROBITY WOULD NOT THEY SAY HAVE RECOGNISED AND HAVE GIVEN HIS TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE CLAIMANT
A FEASIBLE STORY WAS INVENTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ESCAPE OF THE INTENDED VICTIM OF THE LATE MASSACRE AND TO CONFIRM THE NATION IN THE BELIEF OF HIS IDENTITY WITH THEIR LATE CZAR MARINA THE WIDOWED CZARINA
THE ABSENT ELECTOR APPARENTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE SAD EVENT DID NOT RETURN AND IT WAS QUICKLY NOISED ABROAD HAD ALSO MET WITH A SUDDEN DEATH
WHO HAD DISAPPEARED NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS PREVIOUSLY ON A PILGRIMAGE TO THE CHIEF PLACES OF THE HOLY LAND WHICH HE HAD IT WAS GIVEN FORTH VISITED BUT HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER AND BEEN KEPT IN CAPTIVITY BY THE INFIDELS UNTIL RECENTLY
HE COULD NOT BE WHAT HE SAID HE WAS AND MUST GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS THE SECOND PRINCE SET OUT SOON AFTERWARDS ON THE SAME ERRAND AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE GOLDEN ROAD AND HIS HORSE HAD SET ONE FOOT UPON IT
PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED HIM AS HER OWN DEMETRIUS LIVED WITH HIM AS HIS CONSORT AND HAD A CHILD BY HIM HER FATHER THE PALATINE OF SANDOMIR ALSO RECOGNIZED HIM AS HIS SON IN LAW
THE SLOVENLY WAY IN WHICH THE INQUIRY HAD BEEN MADE THE FACT THAT IT HAD BEEN CONDUCTED BY CREATURES OF BORIS THAT THE BODY WAS NEVER EXAMINED NOR THE KNIFE COMPARED WITH THE WOUND TOGETHER WITH THE ATTEMPTED OBLITERATION OF ALL SURROUNDING DWELLINGS
HE DID IT THOROUGHLY AND BROUGHT A CHEST FULL OF GOLD OUT WITH HIM THE HOWLING OF THE WILD DOGS WAS HENCEFORTH HEARD NO MORE THEY HAD DISAPPEARED AND THE COUNTRY WAS FREED FROM THE TROUBLE AFTER SOME TIME
AND THE GREEK PRIESTHOOD BY A CARELESS OR IRREVERENT DEMEANOUR TOWARDS THEIR CHURCH
AND THEN TO MARRY HIM AND TO GIVE HIM THE KINGDOM THEN THEY ALL THREE RODE ON TOGETHER AND ON THEIR WAY HOME CAME TO A COUNTRY THAT WAS LAID WASTE BY WAR AND A DREADFUL FAMINE
THE STATEMENT AS TO HIS DECEASE IN THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO IS THEY POINT OUT CONTRADICTORY WHILST HAD THE ELECTOR LOUIS KNOWN OF HIS PREDECESSOR'S DEATH WHY DID HE NOT PROCURE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF THE SAME
ELECTOR OF THE FAMILY OF THE COUNTS OF ASCAGNE A FAMILY CLOSELY RELATED
THE PRINCE BEGGED SO HARD FOR HIS BROTHERS THAT THE DWARF AT LAST SET THEM FREE THOUGH UNWILLINGLY SAYING BEWARE OF THEM FOR THEY HAVE BAD HEARTS THEIR BROTHER HOWEVER
HIS CONSORT MARINA DIED IN PRISON AND IVAN ONE OF THEIR CHILDREN
AND WE SHALL HAVE THE REWARD PRAY WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS
THE REGENT LEFT THIS BOY TO THE CARE OF HIS MOTHER THE DOWAGER CZARINA UNDER WHOSE CHARGE HE ATTAINED TO THE AGE OF TEN ONE AFTERNOON OF MAY FIFTEEN NINETY ONE THE CHILD WAS PLAYING WITH FOUR OTHER BOYS
CONFIRMED BY LETTERS PATENT IN THIRTEEN FIFTY NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONTESTATION OF VOLDEMAR AND HIS PARTISANS ACCORDING TO THE POPULAR ACCOUNT THE PSEUDO VOLDEMAR WAS ULTIMATELY OVERTHROWN
AND I AM GLAD THAT I HAD PITY ON HIM BUT LET HIM GO IN PEACE AND BROUGHT HOME HIS ROYAL COAT AT THIS THE KING WAS OVERWHELMED WITH JOY AND MADE IT KNOWN THROUGHOUT ALL HIS KINGDOM
AND THAT THEY HAVE WALKED IN A MOODY HUMOUR FOR THE LADY HAS PRODDED LITTLE SPIRTING HOLES IN THE DAMP SAND BEFORE HER WITH HER PARASOL AND THE GENTLEMAN HAS TRAILED HIS STICK AFTER HIM
CRYING ON A BLOCK OF STONE AND IS IN ALL THE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN HUMOURS OF HER SEX AT ONCE PENDING HER CHANGES THOSE AFORESAID MARKS IN HIS FACE HAVE COME AND GONE NOW HERE NOW THERE LIKE WHITE STEPS OF A PIPE ON WHICH THE DIABOLICAL PERFORMER HAS PLAYED A TUNE
YIELDING TO HIS HAND SHE RISES AND THEY WALK AGAIN BUT THIS TIME WITH THEIR FACES TURNED TOWARDS THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE MISSUS LAMMLE WE HAVE BOTH BEEN DECEIVING AND WE HAVE BOTH BEEN DECEIVED
THAT THE POKEY UNKNOWNS SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN BEING UNIMPRESSIBLE THEY PERSIST IN NOT BEING FRIGHTENED BY THE GOLD AND SILVER CAMELS AND THEY ARE BANDED TOGETHER TO DEFY THE ELABORATELY CHASED ICE PAILS THEY EVEN SEEM TO UNITE IN SOME VAGUE UTTERANCE OF THE SENTIMENT
VENEERING'S FLOWERS SNUB NOSED ONE RATHER PRETTY BUT TOO CONSCIOUS OF HER STOCKINGS BONNETS THREE POUND TEN
TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT UPON TRUST BUT THE FOLLY IS COMMITTED ON BOTH SIDES I CANNOT GET RID OF YOU YOU CANNOT GET RID OF ME WHAT FOLLOWS SHAME AND MISERY THE BRIDE BITTERLY REPLIES I DON'T KNOW A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING FOLLOWS
IN A NUT SHELL THERE'S THE STATE OF THE CASE YOU SOUGHT ME OUT TUT
DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THEN SOPHRONIA
BUT HERE COLLAPSES AND DOES NOT COMPLETELY RECOVER UNTIL DINNER IS OVER AND THE ANALYTICAL HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO WITHDRAW WE NOW COME SAYS VENEERING TO THE POINT THE REAL POINT OF OUR LITTLE FAMILY CONSULTATION SOPHRONIA
BE VENEERING'S OLDEST FRIENDS WARDS OF HIS PERHAPS YET THAT CAN SCARCELY BE FOR THEY ARE OLDER THAN HIMSELF
AND I CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESS TO YOU MY DEAR PODSNAP THE PLEASURE I FEEL IN HAVING THIS OPINION OF MINE AND ANASTATIA'S SO READILY CONFIRMED BY YOU THAT OTHER EQUALLY FAMILIAR AND TRIED FRIEND WHO STANDS IN THE PROUD POSITION
WORN OUT BY WORRY AND EXCITEMENT AS SHE TELLS HER DEAR MISTER TWEMLOW
YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR MY DEAR FELLOWS ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED AS MY WIFE AND I MAKE IT A FAMILY AFFAIR THE ENTIRE DIRECTION OF WHICH WE TAKE UPON OURSELVES OF COURSE OUR FIRST STEP IS TO COMMUNICATE THE FACT TO OUR FAMILY FRIENDS
A WASTE A WASTE A WASTE MY TWEMLOW
SAYING ALOUD WHEN THEY ARE PROFFERED TO HER NO NO NO NOT FOR ME TAKE IT AWAY AS WITH A SET PURPOSE OF IMPLYING A MISGIVING THAT IF NOURISHED UPON SIMILAR MEATS SHE MIGHT COME TO BE LIKE THAT CHARMER WHICH WOULD BE A FATAL CONSUMMATION
SHE BURSTS INTO TEARS DECLARING HERSELF THE WRETCHEDEST THE MOST DECEIVED THE WORST USED OF WOMEN THEN SHE SAYS THAT IF SHE HAD THE COURAGE TO KILL HERSELF SHE WOULD DO IT THEN SHE CALLS HIM VILE IMPOSTOR
THIRTY SHILLINGS A YARD VEIL FIFTEEN POUND POCKET HANDKERCHIEF A PRESENT BRIDESMAIDS
WHAT SQUEEZES HIM INTO PARLIAMENT SHARES PERHAPS HE NEVER OF HIMSELF ACHIEVED SUCCESS IN ANYTHING NEVER ORIGINATED ANYTHING NEVER PRODUCED ANYTHING SUFFICIENT ANSWER TO ALL SHARES O MIGHTY SHARES
VENEERING'S HOUSE REACHED DRAWING ROOMS MOST MAGNIFICENT HERE THE PODSNAPS AWAIT THE HAPPY PARTY MISTER PODSNAP WITH HIS HAIR BRUSHES MADE THE MOST OF THAT IMPERIAL ROCKING HORSE MISSUS PODSNAP MAJESTICALLY SKITTISH HERE TOO ARE BOOTS AND BREWER
HE IS AT HER SIDE AGAIN IN A PACE OR TWO AND HE RETORTS THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU SAID YOU SAID DISINGENUOUSNESS WHAT IF I DID THERE IS NO IF IN THE CASE YOU DID I DID THEN AND WHAT OF IT
AND OMINOUS MARKS HAVE COME TO LIGHT ABOUT HIS NOSE AS IF THE FINGER OF THE VERY DEVIL HIMSELF HAD WITHIN THE LAST FEW MOMENTS TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE BUT HE HAS REPRESSIVE POWER AND SHE HAS NONE THROW IT AWAY HE COOLLY RECOMMENDS AS TO THE PARASOL
PUTTING IT ON ME THE UNMANLY DISINGENUOUSNESS MISTER LAMMLE STOPS RELEASES HIS WHISKERS AND LOOKS AT HER THE WHAT MISSUS LAMMLE HAUGHTILY REPLIES WITHOUT STOPPING AND WITHOUT LOOKING BACK THE MEANNESS
THOSE LOVELY BEINGS BECOME EACH ONE OF HER OWN ACCOUNT DEPRECIATINGLY CONTEMPLATIVE OF THE MILLINERY PRESENT WHILE THE BRIDEGROOM'S MAN EXHAUSTED IN THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR APPEARS TO BE IMPROVING THE OCCASION BY PENITENTIALLY CONTEMPLATING ALL THE WRONG HE HAS EVER DONE
AGAIN THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUESTION MISSUS LAMMLE WHAT DO YOU PRETEND TO BELIEVE SO YOU FIRST DECEIVE ME AND THEN INSULT ME CRIES THE LADY WITH A HEAVING BOSOM
RETURNS MORTIMER EUGENE IS ALSO IN ATTENDANCE WITH A PERVADING AIR UPON HIM OF HAVING PRESUPPOSED THE CEREMONY TO BE A FUNERAL AND OF BEING DISAPPOINTED
I SUPPOSE SO AGREED CARRIED AT ONCE YOU SEE NOW SOPHRONIA ONLY HALF A DOZEN WORDS MORE WE KNOW ONE ANOTHER PERFECTLY DON'T BE TEMPTED INTO TWITTING ME WITH THE PAST KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE OF ME
THE ANALYTICAL WHO OBJECTS AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE TO EVERYTHING THAT OCCURS ON THE PREMISES NECESSARILY OBJECTS TO THE MATCH BUT HIS CONSENT HAS BEEN DISPENSED WITH AND A SPRING VAN IS DELIVERING ITS LOAD OF GREENHOUSE PLANTS AT THE DOOR
I HAVE ORIGINATED NOTHING THE DOUBLE EDGED QUESTION WAS YOURS WAS MINE THE BRIDE REPEATS AND HER PARASOL BREAKS IN HER ANGRY HAND
BECAUSE IT IS IDENTICAL WITH THE PAST KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE OF YOU AND IN TWITTING ME YOU TWIT YOURSELF AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU DO IT WITH THIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING ESTABLISHED BETWEEN US IT IS BETTER NEVER DONE TO WIND UP ALL YOU HAVE SHOWN TEMPER TODAY SOPHRONIA
BROODING OVER THE FIRE WITH HIS DRIED LITTLE HEAD IN HIS DRIED LITTLE HANDS AND HIS DRIED LITTLE ELBOWS ON HIS DRIED LITTLE KNEES TWEMLOW IS MELANCHOLY NO ADORABLE TO BEAR ME COMPANY HERE THINKS HE NO ADORABLE AT THE CLUB
AND OVER THE STABLE YARD IN DUKE STREET SAINT JAMES'S RECEIVED A HIGHLY PERFUMED COCKED HAT AND MONOGRAM FROM MISSUS VENEERING ENTREATING HER DEAREST MISTER T IF NOT PARTICULARLY ENGAGED THAT DAY TO COME LIKE A CHARMING SOUL AND MAKE A FOURTH AT DINNER WITH DEAR MISTER PODSNAP
INCLUDING LADY TIPPINS'S YAWNING FALLING ASLEEP AND WAKING INSENSIBLE AND THERE IS HURRIED PREPARATION FOR THE NUPTIAL JOURNEY TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND THE OUTER AIR TEEMS WITH BRASS BANDS AND SPECTATORS
MY DEAR TWEMLOW SAYS VENEERING YOUR READY RESPONSE TO ANASTATIA'S UNCEREMONIOUS INVITATION IS TRULY KIND AND LIKE AN OLD OLD FRIEND YOU KNOW OUR DEAR FRIEND PODSNAP TWEMLOW OUGHT TO KNOW THE DEAR FRIEND PODSNAP WHO COVERED HIM WITH SO MUCH CONFUSION
IN THE FRIENDLIEST MANNER HE IS MAKING HIMSELF QUITE AT HOME WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE EXECUTING A STATUETTE OF THE COLOSSUS AT RHODES TWEMLOW HAS BEFORE NOTICED IN HIS FEEBLE WAY HOW SOON THE VENEERING GUESTS BECOME INFECTED WITH THE VENEERING FICTION
NO THEN YOU MARRIED ME ON FALSE PRETENCES IF YOU WERE SO DULL A FORTUNE HUNTER THAT YOU DECEIVED YOURSELF OR IF YOU WERE SO GREEDY AND GRASPING THAT YOU WERE OVER WILLING TO BE DECEIVED BY APPEARANCES IS IT MY FAULT YOU ADVENTURER THE LADY DEMANDS WITH GREAT ASPERITY
MAY BE CROWNED WITH FLOWERS THE MATURE YOUNG LADY IS A LADY OF PROPERTY THE MATURE YOUNG GENTLEMAN IS A GENTLEMAN OF PROPERTY HE INVESTS HIS PROPERTY HE GOES IN A CONDESCENDING AMATEURISH WAY INTO THE CITY
SPLENDID BRACELET PRODUCED BY VENEERING BEFORE GOING DOWN AND CLASPED UPON THE ARM OF BRIDE YET NOBODY SEEMS TO THINK MUCH MORE OF THE VENEERINGS THAN IF THEY WERE A TOLERABLE LANDLORD AND LANDLADY DOING THE THING IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS AT SO MUCH A HEAD
AND TURNS UPON HIM DON'T PUT IT UPON ME SIR I ASK YOU DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME MISTER LAMMLE FALLS SILENT AGAIN AND THEY WALK AS BEFORE MISSUS LAMMLE OPENS HER NOSTRILS AND BITES HER UNDER LIP
CAN'T WE UNITED PRETEND TO THE WORLD AGREED SECONDLY WE OWE THE VENEERINGS A GRUDGE AND WE OWE ALL OTHER PEOPLE THE GRUDGE OF WISHING THEM TO BE TAKEN IN AS WE OURSELVES HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN AGREED YES AGREED
AT LENGTH COMES TO BE EXPECTED BY THE COMPANY WHO MAKE EMBARRASSING PAUSES WHEN IT IS FALLING DUE AND BY WAITING FOR IT RENDER IT MORE EMPHATIC WHEN IT COMES THE STONEY AUNT HAS LIKEWISE AN INJURIOUS WAY OF REJECTING ALL DISHES WHEREOF LADY TIPPINS PARTAKES
WE COME SMOOTHLY TO THIRDLY YOU HAVE CALLED ME AN ADVENTURER SOPHRONIA SO I AM IN PLAIN UNCOMPLIMENTARY ENGLISH SO I AM SO ARE YOU MY DEAR SO ARE MANY PEOPLE
WITH A SMACK AND A RELISH
FOR THE POOR LITTLE HARMLESS GENTLEMAN ONCE HAD HIS FANCY LIKE THE REST OF US AND SHE DIDN'T ANSWER AS SHE OFTEN DOES NOT AND HE THINKS THE ADORABLE BRIDESMAID IS LIKE THE FANCY AS SHE WAS THEN WHICH SHE IS NOT AT ALL
THERE WAS A GOLDEN SURFACE ON THE BROWN CLIFFS BUT NOW AND BEHOLD THEY ARE ONLY DAMP EARTH A TAUNTING ROAR COMES FROM THE SEA AND THE FAR OUT ROLLERS MOUNT UPON ONE ANOTHER TO LOOK AT THE ENTRAPPED IMPOSTORS AND TO JOIN IN IMPISH AND EXULTANT GAMBOLS
IF WHEN THOSE INFERNAL FINGER MARKS WERE ON THE WHITE AND BREATHLESS COUNTENANCE OF ALFRED LAMMLE ESQUIRE THEY DENOTED THAT HE CONCEIVED THE PURPOSE OF SUBDUING HIS DEAR WIFE MISSUS ALFRED LAMMLE BY AT ONCE DIVESTING HER OF ANY LINGERING REALITY OR PRETENCE OF SELF RESPECT
BECAUSE I COULDN'T TAKE SO MUCH UPON MYSELF WHEN I HAVE RESPECTED FAMILY FRIENDS TO REMEMBER SECONDLY
ON THE SANDS AT SHANKLIN IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT MISTER AND MISSUS LAMMLE HAVE WALKED FOR SOME TIME ON THE SHANKLIN SANDS AND ONE MAY SEE BY THEIR FOOTPRINTS THAT THEY HAVE NOT WALKED ARM IN ARM AND THAT THEY HAVE NOT WALKED IN A STRAIGHT TRACK
AND WHOSE LEFT HAND APPEARS TO BE IN A STATE OF ACUTE RHEUMATISM BUT IS IN FACT VOLUNTARILY DOUBLED UP TO ACT AS A MONEY BOX AND NOW VENEERING SHOOTS OUT OF THE STUDY WHEREIN HE IS ACCUSTOMED WHEN CONTEMPLATIVE
SO WE AGREE TO KEEP THE FACT TO OURSELVES YOU AGREE IF IT IS POSSIBLE I DO POSSIBLE
IF YOU HAD WAITED A MOMENT YOU TOO ARE DISAPPOINTED AND CUT A POOR FIGURE AN INJURED FIGURE YOU ARE NOW COOL ENOUGH SOPHRONIA TO SEE THAT YOU CAN'T BE INJURED WITHOUT MY BEING EQUALLY INJURED AND THAT THEREFORE THE MERE WORD IS NOT TO THE PURPOSE
WITH A HEAVY SHOE WHICH A BUFFER IN THE HALL CHAMPAGNE FLUSHED AND WILD OF AIM HAS BORROWED ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT FROM THE PASTRYCOOK'S PORTER TO CAST AFTER THE DEPARTING PAIR AS AN AUSPICIOUS OMEN SO THEY ALL GO UP AGAIN INTO THE GORGEOUS DRAWING ROOMS
TO SET THOSE BLARING IMAGES SO HIGH AND TO CAUSE US SMALLER VERMIN AS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HENBANE OR OPIUM TO CRY OUT NIGHT AND DAY RELIEVE US OF OUR MONEY SCATTER IT FOR US BUY US AND SELL US RUIN US ONLY WE BESEECH YE TAKE RANK AMONG THE POWERS OF THE EARTH AND FATTEN ON US
NOT HOWEVER THAT HE HAS THE LEAST NOTION OF ITS BEING HIS OWN CASE OUR FRIENDS ALFRED AND SOPHRONIA PURSUES VENEERING THE VEILED PROPHET OUR FRIENDS ALFRED AND SOPHRONIA
WHO WHILE PERFORMING THE CEREMONY WAS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO OBSERVE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHO WHO WHO WHY WHY WHY BEGINS TO BE DYED AND VARNISHED FOR THE INTERESTING OCCASION
AND HE SAYS HE DOES KNOW HIM AND PODSNAP RECIPROCATES APPARENTLY PODSNAP HAS BEEN SO WROUGHT UPON IN A SHORT TIME AS TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS BEEN INTIMATE IN THE HOUSE MANY MANY MANY YEARS
ALSO HIS LIVID LIPS ARE PARTED AT LAST AS IF HE WERE BREATHLESS WITH RUNNING YET HE IS NOT NOW GET UP MISSUS LAMMLE AND LET US SPEAK REASONABLY SHE SITS UPON HER STONE AND TAKES NO HEED OF HIM GET UP I TELL YOU
YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS WITH IT WHEREUPON SHE CALLS HIM IN HER RAGE A DELIBERATE VILLAIN AND SO CASTS THE BROKEN THING FROM HER AS THAT IT STRIKES HIM IN FALLING THE FINGER MARKS ARE SOMETHING WHITER FOR THE INSTANT BUT HE WALKS ON AT HER SIDE
AND AFTER HER APPEARS ALFRED WHOM TWEMLOW HAS SEEN ONCE IN HIS LIFETIME TO DO THE SAME AND TO MAKE A PASTY SORT OF GLITTER AS IF HE WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR CANDLE LIGHT ONLY AND HAD BEEN LET OUT INTO DAYLIGHT BY SOME GRAND MISTAKE AND AFTER THAT COMES MISSUS VENEERING
AND A LOOK AT THE MARRIAGE SERVICE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY CUT IN AT THE RIGHT PLACE TO MORROW AND HE IS LOW AND FEELS IT DULL OVER THE LIVERY STABLE YARD AND IS DISTINCTLY AWARE OF A DINT IN HIS HEART MADE BY THE MOST ADORABLE OF THE ADORABLE BRIDESMAIDS
UNITED IN THE BONDS OF MATRIMONY ALFRED LAMMLE ESQUIRE OF SACKVILLE STREET PICCADILLY TO SOPHRONIA ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE LATE HORATIO AKERSHEM ESQUIRE OF YORKSHIRE ALSO HOW THE FAIR BRIDE WAS MARRIED FROM THE HOUSE OF HAMILTON VENEERING
AND FEELS AVERSE TO MY GIVING AWAY ANYBODY UNTIL BABY IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE MARRIED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE DID PODSNAP INQUIRES OF MISSUS VENEERING MY DEAR MISTER PODSNAP IT'S VERY FOOLISH I KNOW BUT I HAVE AN INSTINCTIVE PRESENTIMENT THAT IF HAMILTON
WHICH MAKES SEVEN TWEMLOW THOUGHT AND CONFIDENTIALLY RETIRING WITH HIM INTO THE CONSERVATORY IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT VENEERING IS HIS CO TRUSTEE AND THAT THEY ARE ARRANGING ABOUT THE FORTUNE BUFFERS ARE EVEN OVERHEARD TO WHISPER
TO GIVE HIS MIND TO THE CARVING AND GILDING OF THE PILGRIMS GOING TO CANTERBURY IN ORDER TO SHOW TWEMLOW THE LITTLE FLOURISH HE HAS PREPARED FOR THE TRUMPETS OF FASHION DESCRIBING HOW THAT ON THE SEVENTEENTH INSTANT AT SAINT JAMES'S CHURCH THE REVEREND BLANK BLANK ASSISTED BY THE REVEREND DASH DASH
IS PERHAPS KNOWN TO HER MAID BUT YOU COULD EASILY BUY ALL YOU SEE OF HER IN BOND STREET OR YOU MIGHT SCALP HER AND PEEL HER AND SCRAPE HER AND MAKE TWO LADY TIPPINSES OUT OF HER AND YET NOT PENETRATE TO THE GENUINE ARTICLE
BOOTS AND BREWER OBSERVES VENEERING WHOM YOU ALSO KNOW I HAVE NOT ASKED TO DAY BUT I RESERVE THEM FOR THE OCCASION THEN THINKS TWEMLOW WITH HIS EYES SHUT
VENEERING WITH GREAT CONTEMPT AND WHAT DOES VENEERING KNOW ABOUT ME WAS HE NOT YOUR TRUSTEE NO I HAVE NO TRUSTEE BUT THE ONE YOU SAW ON THE DAY WHEN YOU FRAUDULENTLY MARRIED ME
AND THE TWO OTHER BUFFERS EACH BUFFER WITH A FLOWER IN HIS BUTTON HOLE HIS HAIR CURLED AND HIS GLOVES BUTTONED ON TIGHT APPARENTLY COME PREPARED
OF BABY'S GODFATHER AND INDEED VENEERING IS MUCH RELIEVED IN MIND TO FIND THAT PODSNAP BETRAYS NO JEALOUSY OF TWEMLOW'S ELEVATION SO IT HAS COME TO PASS THAT THE SPRING VAN IS STREWING FLOWERS ON THE ROSY HOURS AND ON THE STAIRCASE
AND HE MUTTERS SOMETHING BUT CHECKS HIMSELF QUESTION FOR QUESTION IT IS MY TURN AGAIN MISSUS LAMMLE WHAT MADE YOU SUPPOSE ME A MAN OF PROPERTY YOU MADE ME SUPPOSE YOU SO
DON'T BE BETRAYED INTO DOING SO AGAIN BECAUSE I HAVE A DEVIL OF A TEMPER MYSELF SO THE HAPPY PAIR WITH THIS HOPEFUL MARRIAGE CONTRACT THUS SIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED REPAIR HOMEWARD
GAVE AWAY ANYBODY ELSE FIRST HE WOULD NEVER GIVE AWAY BABY THUS MISSUS VENEERING WITH HER OPEN HANDS PRESSED TOGETHER AND EACH OF HER EIGHT AQUILINE FINGERS LOOKING SO VERY LIKE HER ONE AQUILINE NOSE THAT THE BRAN NEW JEWELS ON THEM SEEM NECESSARY FOR DISTINCTION'S SAKE
SHE HAS A LARGE GOLD EYE GLASS HAS LADY TIPPINS TO SURVEY THE PROCEEDINGS WITH IF SHE HAD ONE IN EACH EYE IT MIGHT KEEP THAT OTHER DROOPING LID UP AND LOOK MORE UNIFORM BUT PERENNIAL YOUTH IS IN HER ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS AND HER LIST OF LOVERS IS FULL
HE HAS ANSWERED NOT PRECISELY SO TWEMLOW'S HAND HAS GONE TO HIS FOREHEAD WITH A LOST AIR BUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO TWEMLOW SITTING OVER HIS NEWSPAPER AND OVER HIS DRY TOAST AND WEAK TEA
AND HAS DONE MUCH TO LURE THEM TO THE ALTAR
BETIMES NEXT MORNING THAT HORRIBLE OLD LADY TIPPINS
THAT IF THE REVEREND BLANK BLANK AND THE REVEREND DASH DASH FAIL AFTER THIS INTRODUCTION TO BECOME ENROLLED IN THE LIST OF VENEERING'S DEAREST AND OLDEST FRIENDS THEY WILL HAVE NONE BUT THEMSELVES TO THANK FOR IT AFTER WHICH APPEARS SOPHRONIA
AS THIS HAPPENS TO BE TRUE MISSUS LAMMLE IS THROWN ON THE FEMININE RESOURCE OF SAYING I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU UTTERED OR DID NOT UTTER
DO I MEAN TO TELL YOU DO I MEAN TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT YOU ARE A MAN OF PROPERTY NO THEN YOU MARRIED ME ON FALSE PRETENCES SO BE IT NEXT COMES WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY
AND WHEN I LOOK BACK THE BRIDE CRIES INTERRUPTING AND WHEN YOU LOOK BACK YOU WONDER HOW YOU CAN HAVE BEEN YOU'LL EXCUSE THE WORD MOST CERTAINLY WITH SO MUCH REASON SUCH A FOOL AS TO TAKE ME
OR I OUGHT RATHER TO SAY
AWARE OF HER ENEMY LADY TIPPINS TRIES A YOUTHFUL SALLY OR TWO AND TRIES THE EYE GLASS BUT FROM THE IMPENETRABLE CAP AND SNORTING ARMOUR OF THE STONEY AUNT ALL WEAPONS REBOUND POWERLESS ANOTHER OBJECTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IS
YOU TELL ME TELL ME FORSOOTH SHE AFFECTS NOT TO KNOW THAT HIS EYES ARE FASTENED ON HER AS SHE DROOPS HER HEAD AGAIN BUT HER WHOLE FIGURE REVEALS THAT SHE KNOWS IT UNEASILY ENOUGH OF THIS COME DO YOU HEAR GET UP
THEN SHE ASKS HIM WHY IN THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF HIS BASE SPECULATION HE DOES NOT TAKE HER LIFE WITH HIS OWN HAND UNDER THE PRESENT FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THEN SHE CRIES AGAIN THEN SHE IS ENRAGED AGAIN AND MAKES SOME MENTION OF SWINDLERS FINALLY SHE SITS DOWN
IS NOW AMONG US THAT FRIEND IS TWEMLOW CERTAINLY FROM PODSNAP THAT FRIEND VENEERING REPEATS WITH GREATER FIRMNESS IS OUR DEAR GOOD TWEMLOW
MORTIMER YOU WRETCH SAYS LADY TIPPINS TURNING THE EYEGLASS ABOUT AND ABOUT WHERE IS YOUR CHARGE THE BRIDEGROOM
AN OILCAKE FED STYLE OF BUSINESS GENTLEMAN WITH MOONEY SPECTACLES AND AN OBJECT OF MUCH INTEREST
AND AN UNACKNOWLEDGED MEMBER OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY WHOM LADY TIPPINS SURVEYING THROUGH HER EYE GLASS CONSIDERS A FINE MAN AND QUITE A CATCH
HAS BUT AN INDIGESTIBLE APPEARANCE HOWEVER ALL THE THINGS INDISPENSABLE TO BE SAID ARE SAID
AND EVEN THE UNKNOWNS ARE SLOWLY STRAINED OFF AND IT IS ALL OVER ALL OVER THAT IS TO SAY FOR THE TIME BEING BUT THERE IS ANOTHER TIME TO COME AND IT COMES IN ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AND IT COMES TO MISTER AND MISSUS LAMMLE
SHE HAS A REPUTATION FOR GIVING SMART ACCOUNTS OF THINGS AND SHE MUST BE AT THESE PEOPLE'S EARLY MY DEAR TO LOSE NOTHING OF THE FUN WHEREABOUT IN THE BONNET AND DRAPERY ANNOUNCED BY HER NAME ANY FRAGMENT OF THE REAL WOMAN MAY BE CONCEALED
MISTER LAMMLE TAKES HIS GINGEROUS WHISKERS IN HIS LEFT HAND AND BRINGING THEM TOGETHER FROWNS FURTIVELY AT HIS BELOVED OUT OF A THICK GINGEROUS BUSH DO I MEAN TO SAY
ALL OF THEM FLUSHED WITH BREAKFAST AS HAVING TAKEN SCARLATINA SOCIABLY
OH THINKS TWEMLOW WITH HIS EYES ON PODSNAP THEN THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF US AND HE'S THE OTHER I DID HOPE VENEERING GOES ON TO HAVE HAD LADY TIPPINS TO MEET YOU
ESQUIRE OF STUCCONIA AND WAS GIVEN AWAY BY MELVIN TWEMLOW ESQUIRE OF DUKE STREET SAINT JAMES'S SECOND COUSIN TO LORD SNIGSWORTH OF SNIGSWORTHY PARK WHILE PERUSING WHICH COMPOSITION TWEMLOW MAKES SOME OPAQUE APPROACH TO PERCEIVING
POKEY UNKNOWNS AMAZED TO FIND HOW INTIMATELY THEY KNOW VENEERING PLUCK UP SPIRIT FOLD THEIR ARMS AND BEGIN TO CONTRADICT HIM BEFORE BREAKFAST WHAT TIME MISSUS VENEERING CARRYING BABY DRESSED AS A BRIDESMAID FLITS ABOUT AMONG THE COMPANY
EMITTING FLASHES OF MANY COLOURED LIGHTNING FROM DIAMONDS EMERALDS AND RUBIES THE ANALYTICAL IN COURSE OF TIME ACHIEVING WHAT HE FEELS TO BE DUE TO HIMSELF IN BRINGING TO A DIGNIFIED CONCLUSION SEVERAL QUARRELS HE HAS ON HAND WITH THE PASTRYCOOK'S MEN
THE MATURE YOUNG LADY IN THE LIGHT OF A SISTER AND ALFRED LAMMLE THE MATURE YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN THE LIGHT OF A BROTHER TWEMLOW HAS ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WENT TO SCHOOL AS A JUNIOR WITH ALFRED HE HAS ANSWERED NOT EXACTLY WHETHER SOPHRONIA WAS ADOPTED BY HIS MOTHER
NEITHER WILL I RETURNS THE BRIDEGROOM WITH THAT THEY WALK AGAIN SHE MAKING THOSE ANGRY SPIRTS IN THE SAND HE DRAGGING THAT DEJECTED TAIL
WE AGREE TO KEEP OUR OWN SECRET AND TO WORK TOGETHER IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR OWN SCHEMES WHAT SCHEMES ANY SCHEME THAT WILL BRING US MONEY BY OUR OWN SCHEMES I MEAN OUR JOINT INTEREST AGREED
BUT MY DEAR PODSNAP QUOTH VENEERING THERE IS A TRIED FRIEND OF OUR FAMILY WHO I THINK AND HOPE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME PODSNAP IS THE FRIEND ON WHOM THIS AGREEABLE DUTY ALMOST NATURALLY DEVOLVES THAT FRIEND
AND HIS TRUST IS NOT A VERY DIFFICULT ONE FOR IT IS ONLY AN ANNUITY OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN POUNDS I THINK THERE ARE SOME ODD SHILLINGS OR PENCE IF YOU ARE VERY PARTICULAR MISTER LAMMLE BESTOWS A BY NO MEANS LOVING LOOK UPON THE PARTNER OF HIS JOYS AND SORROWS
THAT THE LATTER IN THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR APPEARS TO BE CONTEMPLATING ALL THE WRONG HE WOULD LIKE TO DO PARTICULARLY TO THE PRESENT COMPANY IN WHICH STATE OF AFFAIRS THE USUAL CEREMONIES RATHER DROOP AND FLAG AND THE SPLENDID CAKE WHEN CUT BY THE FAIR HAND OF THE BRIDE
THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM TALK AND LAUGH APART AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THEIR MANNER AND THE BUFFERS WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE DISHES WITH SYSTEMATIC PERSEVERANCE
AND TO COME LIKE ADORABLE RECRUITS ENLISTED BY A SERGEANT NOT PRESENT FOR ON ARRIVING AT THE VENEERING DEPOT THEY ARE IN A BARRACK OF STRANGERS SO TWEMLOW GOES HOME TO DUKE STREET SAINT JAMES'S TO TAKE A PLATE OF MUTTON BROTH WITH A CHOP IN IT
AND TAKE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OUT OF THE SPLENDID FURNITURE AND SO LADY TIPPINS
MISERABLE IS THAT THE WAY YOU DO YOUR DUTY BEYOND AN IMPRESSION THAT HE IS TO SIT UPON MY KNEE AND BE SECONDED AT SOME POINT OF THE SOLEMNITIES
WHAT OF IT SAYS MISTER LAMMLE HAVE YOU THE FACE TO UTTER THE WORD TO ME THE FACE TOO REPLIED MISSUS LAMMLE STARING AT HIM WITH COLD SCORN PRAY HOW DARE YOU SIR UTTER THE WORD TO ME I NEVER DID
WHILE THE LOVES AND GRACES HAVE BEEN PREPARING THIS TORCH FOR HYMEN WHICH IS TO BE KINDLED TO MORROW MISTER TWEMLOW HAS SUFFERED MUCH IN HIS MIND
THE MALIGNANT STAR OF THE ANALYTICAL HAS PRE ORDAINED THAT PAIN AND RIDICULE SHALL BEFALL HIM FOR HE STANDING ON THE DOORSTEPS TO GRACE THE DEPARTURE IS SUDDENLY CAUGHT
A MARRIAGE CONTRACT THERE IS EXCITEMENT IN THE VENEERING MANSION THE MATURE YOUNG LADY IS GOING TO BE MARRIED POWDER AND ALL TO THE MATURE YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND SHE IS TO BE MARRIED FROM THE VENEERING HOUSE AND THE VENEERINGS ARE TO GIVE THE BREAKFAST
BUT YOU ASKED SOMEBODY TOO COME MISSUS LAMMLE ADMISSION FOR ADMISSION YOU ASKED SOMEBODY
ANNOUNCES BREAKFAST DINING ROOM NO LESS MAGNIFICENT THAN DRAWING ROOM TABLES SUPERB ALL THE CAMELS OUT AND ALL LADEN SPLENDID CAKE COVERED WITH CUPIDS SILVER AND TRUE LOVERS KNOTS
OSCILLATE ON MYSTERIOUS BUSINESS BETWEEN LONDON AND PARIS AND BE GREAT WHERE DOES HE COME FROM SHARES WHERE IS HE GOING TO SHARES WHAT ARE HIS TASTES SHARES HAS HE ANY PRINCIPLES SHARES
DO YOU PRETEND TO BELIEVE MISSUS LAMMLE RESUMES STERNLY WHEN YOU TALK OF MY MARRYING YOU FOR WORLDLY ADVANTAGES THAT IT WAS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF REASONABLE PROBABILITY
OH THINKS TWEMLOW WITH HIS EYES WANDERING THEN THERE ARE THREE OF US AND SHE'S THE OTHER MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD RESUMES VENEERING WHOM YOU BOTH KNOW IS OUT OF TOWN BUT HE WRITES IN HIS WHIMSICAL MANNER
AND THAT IF THE FANCY HAD NOT MARRIED SOME ONE ELSE FOR MONEY BUT HAD MARRIED HIM FOR LOVE HE AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY WHICH THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AND THAT SHE HAS A TENDERNESS FOR HIM STILL WHEREAS HER TOUGHNESS IS A PROVERB
FOR THE DISCUSSION OF AN INTERESTING FAMILY TOPIC THE LAST THREE WORDS DOUBLY UNDERLINED AND POINTED WITH A NOTE OF ADMIRATION AND TWEMLOW REPLYING NOT ENGAGED AND MORE THAN DELIGHTED
AND A LITTLE MORE SILENCE MISTER LAMMLE BREAKS THE LATTER YOU SHALL PROCEED IN YOUR OWN WAY
WE KNOW VERY WELL HOW IT WAS WHY SHOULD YOU AND I TALK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU AND I CAN'T DISGUISE IT TO PROCEED I AM DISAPPOINTED AND CUT A POOR FIGURE AM I NO ONE SOME ONE AND I WAS COMING TO YOU
FOLLOWS EVERY LIVELY REMARK MADE BY THAT DEAR CREATURE WITH AN AUDIBLE SNORT WHICH MAY BE REFERABLE TO A CHRONIC COLD IN THE HEAD BUT MAY ALSO BE REFERABLE TO INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT
ANOTHER DISMAL CIRCUMSTANCE IS THAT VENEERING HAVING THE CAPTIVATING TIPPINS ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE BRIDE'S AUNT ON THE OTHER FINDS IT IMMENSELY DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE PEACE FOR MEDUSA
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER THAT I'VE NOT HAD TIME TO TURN YOUR OFFER OVER THAT'S APOLOGY FOR BOTH OF US FOR MISTER BOFFIN AND FOR ME AS WELL SAID THE SMILING MISSUS BOFFIN BUT LOR
ARRANGE YOUR PAPERS MISTER BOFFIN RUBBED HIS INKY EAR AND LOOKED AT HIS WIFE AND SO ARRANGE THEM AS TO HAVE THEM ALWAYS IN ORDER FOR IMMEDIATE REFERENCE WITH A NOTE OF THE CONTENTS OF EACH OUTSIDE IT
AND FOUND GUILTY AND HAD ARRANGED HIS AFFAIRS AND BEEN MARCHED OUT TO BE SHOT BEFORE THE DOOR BANGED HARD WORK ROWING THE CAB THROUGH THE CITY TO THE TEMPLE FOR A CUP OF FROM FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND POUNDS VALUE GIVEN BY MISTER BOFFIN
WHICH I HOPE MISTER BOFFIN MIGHT EXCUSE SHOULD MAKE YOU SIGH I'LL STRIKE THE LIGHT GUITAR CORRECT TO THE LETTER SAID MISTER BOFFIN AND I CONSIDER THAT THE POETRY BRINGS US BOTH IN IN A BEAUTIFUL MANNER
COME ABOARD OF MINE AND SEE FOR YOUR OWN SELVES THERE WAS A LITTLE BACKWARDNESS IN COMPLYING FOR THE FREIGHT LOOKED TOO MUCH FOR THE BOAT BUT ON RIDERHOOD'S PROTESTING
BUT HE ALWAYS WAS A CHEAT CON FOUND HIM HE ALWAYS WAS A INFERNAL CHEAT WAS GAFFER NOTHING STRAIGHTFOR'ARD NOTHING ON THE SQUARE SO MEAN SO UNDERHANDED NEVER GOING THROUGH WITH A THING NOR CARRYING IT OUT LIKE A MAN HALLO STEADY
THAT HE HAD BECOME A MERE SOMNAMBULIST HE WAS TOO TIRED TO REST IN HIS SLEEP UNTIL HE WAS EVEN TIRED OUT OF BEING TOO TIRED AND DROPPED INTO OBLIVION LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE AWOKE
HE LIKEWISE DROPPED INTO A VERY PRETTY PIECE OF POETRY TO BE SURE RESPECTING THE EXTENT TO WHICH HE WOULD BE WILLING TO PUT HIMSELF OUT OF THE WAY TO BRING MISSUS BOFFIN ROUND IN CASE SHE SHOULD EVER GET LOW IN HER SPIRITS IN THE HOUSE MISSUS BOFFIN HAS A WONDERFUL MEMORY WILL YOU REPEAT IT MY DEAR
SO A HALFPENNY WORTH OF INK WOULD BLOT MISTER BOFFIN TO THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR AND THE CALVES OF HIS LEGS WITHOUT INSCRIBING A LINE ON THE PAPER BEFORE HIM OR APPEARING TO DIMINISH IN THE INKSTAND MISTER BOFFIN WAS IN SUCH SEVERE LITERARY DIFFICULTIES
AND WHEN THAT SECOND HEAP WAS COMPLETE AND THE FIRST GONE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET A PIECE OF STRING AND TIED IT TOGETHER WITH A REMARKABLY DEXTEROUS HAND AT A RUNNING CURVE AND A LOOP GOOD SAID MISTER BOFFIN VERY GOOD NOW
I WOULD TRANSACT YOUR BUSINESS WITH PEOPLE IN YOUR PAY OR EMPLOYMENT I WOULD
NOW HE'S MORE LIKE HIMSELF THOUGH HE'S BADLY BRUISED WHEN THIS MAN THAT WAS ROWS OUT UPON THE RIVER ON HIS USUAL LAY HE CARRIES WITH HIM THIS COIL OF ROPE HE ALWAYS CARRIES WITH HIM THIS COIL OF ROPE IT'S AS WELL KNOWN TO ME AS HE WAS HIMSELF
THAT MISTER BOFFIN IS IN NO WAY COMMITTED ON THAT POINT MISTER BOFFIN HAS MERELY TO ADD THAT HE RELIES ON MISTER JOHN ROKESMITH'S ASSURANCE THAT HE WILL BE FAITHFUL AND SERVICEABLE MISTER JOHN ROKESMITH WILL PLEASE ENTER ON HIS DUTIES IMMEDIATELY
WHEN THERE WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE HAMMER HEADED YOUNG MAN MISTER ROKESMITH OH SAID MISTER BOFFIN OH INDEED OUR AND THE WILFERS MUTUAL FRIEND MY DEAR YES ASK HIM TO COME IN
CONNECTED IN WHICH HE HAS AN INTEREST AS PROPERTY INQUIRED JOHN ROKESMITH WHY NO SAID MISTER BOFFIN NOT EXACTLY THAT
THEN IN A RUSH IT CRUELLY TAUNTS HIM FATHER WAS THAT YOU CALLING ME WAS IT YOU THE VOICELESS AND THE DEAD WAS IT YOU THUS BUFFETED AS YOU LIE HERE IN A HEAP WAS IT YOU
MISTER BOFFIN DREW A LONG BREATH LAID DOWN HIS PEN LOOKED AT HIS NOTES AS DOUBTING WHETHER HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AND APPEARED ON A SECOND PERUSAL OF THEIR COUNTENANCES TO BE CONFIRMED IN HIS IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD NOT
IT HAD THE CURVES AND INDENTATIONS IN IT STILL
ADDED RIDERHOOD CREEPING AFT AND SHOWING A STRETCHED ROPE MADE FAST THERE AND TOWING OVERBOARD DIDN'T I TELL YOU HE WAS IN LUCK AGAIN HAUL IN SAID MISTER INSPECTOR EASY TO SAY HAUL IN ANSWERED RIDERHOOD
YOU'LL DISFIGURE OR PULL ASUNDER PERHAPS I AM NOT GOING TO DO EITHER NOT EVEN TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER SAID MISTER INSPECTOR BUT I MEAN TO HAVE IT COME
MISTER ROKESMITH APPEARED SIT DOWN SIR SAID MISTER BOFFIN SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM MISSUS BOFFIN YOU'RE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH
AND LEANING WELL OVER THE STERN WITH A WILL COME IT WAS AN AWFUL SORT OF FISHING BUT IT NO MORE DISCONCERTED MISTER INSPECTOR THAN IF HE HAD BEEN FISHING IN A PUNT ON A SUMMER EVENING BY SOME SOOTHING WEIR HIGH UP THE PEACEFUL RIVER
SAID LIGHTWOOD CAN WE GET ANYTHING HOT TO DRINK WE COULD AND WE DID IN A PUBLIC HOUSE KITCHEN WITH A LARGE FIRE
AS HE PASSED THROUGH THESE CURIOUS VICISSITUDES OF FATIGUE AND SLUMBER ARRANGED UPON THE SCALE OF A DOZEN HOURS TO THE SECOND HE BECAME AWARE OF ANSWERING ALOUD A COMMUNICATION OF PRESSING IMPORTANCE THAT HAD NEVER BEEN MADE TO HIM AND THEN TURNED IT INTO A COUGH ON BEHOLDING MISTER INSPECTOR
THAT HIS EYES WERE PROMINENT AND FIXED AND HIS BREATHING WAS STERTOROUS WHEN TO THE GREAT RELIEF OF MISSUS BOFFIN WHO OBSERVED THESE SYMPTOMS WITH ALARM THE YARD BELL RANG WHO'S THAT I WONDER SAID MISSUS BOFFIN
MISTER BOFFIN WAS CONFIRMED IN HIS HIGH OPINION OF IT AND WAS GREATLY PLEASED NOW YOU SEE ROKESMITH HE WENT ON A LITERARY MAN WITH A WOODEN LEG IS LIABLE TO JEALOUSY
I SAID SECRETARY ASSENTED MISTER ROKESMITH IT RATHER PUZZLED ME AT THE TIME SAID MISTER BOFFIN AND IT RATHER PUZZLED ME AND MISSUS BOFFIN WHEN WE SPOKE OF IT AFTERWARDS BECAUSE NOT TO MAKE A MYSTERY OF OUR BELIEF
MOSTLY OF MAHOGANY LINED WITH GREEN BAIZE OR LEATHER WITH A LOT OF LITTLE DRAWERS IN IT NOW YOU WON'T THINK I TAKE A LIBERTY WHEN I MENTION THAT YOU CERTAINLY AIN'T THAT CERTAINLY NOT SAID MISTER ROKESMITH BUT HE HAD USED THE WORD
AS THEY BUMPED HEAVILY AGAINST A PILE AND THEN IN A LOWER VOICE REVERSED HIS LATE APOSTROPHE BY REMARKING I WISH THE BOAT OF MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND MAY BE ENDOWED WITH PHILANTHROPY ENOUGH NOT TO TURN BOTTOM UPWARD AND EXTINGUISH US STEADY STEADY SIT CLOSE MORTIMER
SO MUCH COACH MAKER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH HORSE DEALER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH HARNESS MAKER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH GOLDSMITH'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH TOTAL SO VERY MUCH THEN CAME CORRESPONDENCE
AND HOW HER BROKEN SPIRIT SLEPT MISSUS BOFFIN AND NEVER WOKE AGAIN MA'AM I'LL TELL THEE IF AGREEABLE TO MISTER BOFFIN HOW THE STEED DREW NIGH AND LEFT HIS LORD AFAR AND IF MY TALE
THE THREE WATCHERS LOOKED EACH AT THE BLANK FACES OF THE OTHER TWO
AND BEGS TO SAY THAT HE HAS DECIDED ON GIVING MISTER JOHN ROKESMITH A TRIAL IN THE CAPACITY HE DESIRES TO FILL MISTER BOFFIN TAKES MISTER JOHN ROKESMITH AT HIS WORD IN POSTPONING TO SOME INDEFINITE PERIOD THE CONSIDERATION OF SALARY IT IS QUITE UNDERSTOOD
WITH SOMETHING SO SUDDENLY FIERCE IN HIM THAT THE INFORMER RETURNED SUBMISSIVELY WELL WELL WELL T'OTHER GOVERNOR I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A MAN MAY SPEAK AND VERMIN MAY BE SILENT SAID EUGENE
THE INFORMER WIPED HIS BROW RUEFULLY AS HE SAID IT SITTING IN HIS BOAT AND ALWAYS STARING DISCONSOLATE DID YOU MAKE HIS BOAT FAST SHE'S FAST ENOUGH TILL THE TIDE RUNS BACK I COULDN'T MAKE HER FASTER THAN SHE IS
THAT'S TO DROWN YOU IN MY DEARS NOT A LUMBERING BLACK BARGE WITH ITS CRACKED AND BLISTERED SIDE IMPENDING OVER THEM BUT SEEMED TO SUCK AT THE RIVER WITH A THIRST FOR SUCKING THEM UNDER AND EVERYTHING SO VAUNTED THE SPOILING INFLUENCES OF WATER
ACCEPTING LIGHTWOOD'S PROFFERED HAND TO HELP HIM UP HE THEN PUT ON HIS COAT AND SAID TO RIDERHOOD HAND ME OVER THOSE SPARE SCULLS OF YOURS AND I'LL PULL THIS IN TO THE NEAREST STAIRS GO AHEAD YOU AND KEEP OUT IN PRETTY OPEN WATER THAT I MAYN'T GET FOULED AGAIN
YOU MUST BE LET A LITTLE MORE INTO OUR AFFAIRS ROKESMITH I MENTIONED TO YOU WHEN I MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE OR I MIGHT BETTER SAY WHEN YOU MADE MINE
GAFFER'S BOAT GAFFER IN LUCK AGAIN AND YET NO GAFFER SO SPAKE RIDERHOOD STARING DISCONSOLATE
WITH A MORBID EXPECTATION MURMURED EUGENE TO LIGHTWOOD THAT SOMEBODY IS ALWAYS GOING TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH THIS IS HEXAM'S BOAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
THUS BAPTIZED UNTO DEATH WITH THESE FLYING IMPURITIES NOW FLUNG UPON YOUR FACE WHY NOT SPEAK FATHER SOAKING INTO THIS FILTHY GROUND AS YOU LIE HERE IS YOUR OWN SHAPE DID YOU NEVER SEE SUCH A SHAPE SOAKED INTO YOUR BOAT
RELINQUISHING HIS HAT AND GLOVES MISTER ROKESMITH SAT DOWN QUIETLY AT THE TABLE ARRANGED THE OPEN PAPERS INTO AN ORDERLY HEAP CAST HIS EYES OVER EACH IN SUCCESSION FOLDED IT DOCKETED IT ON THE OUTSIDE LAID IT IN A SECOND HEAP
AND LISTENING TO THE LECTURE RECENTLY CONCLUDED AND HAVING TO DINE IN THE TEMPLE WITH AN UNKNOWN MAN WHO DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS M H F EUGENE GAFFER HARMON AND SAID HE LIVED AT HAILSTORM
TO WHOM SHALL IT BE ADDRESSED MISTER BOFFIN ANYONE YOURSELF MISTER ROKESMITH QUICKLY WROTE AND THEN READ ALOUD MISTER BOFFIN PRESENTS HIS COMPLIMENTS TO MISTER JOHN ROKESMITH
LET US HEAR WHAT THEY'RE ALL ABOUT WILL YOU BE SO GOOD JOHN ROKESMITH READ HIS ABSTRACTS ALOUD THEY WERE ALL ABOUT THE NEW HOUSE DECORATOR'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH FURNITURE ESTIMATE SO MUCH ESTIMATE FOR FURNITURE OF OFFICES
AND DRIVEN INTO THAT NOOK AND WEDGED AS HE HAD DESCRIBED WAS GAFFER'S BOAT THAT BOAT WITH THE STAIN STILL IN IT BEARING SOME RESEMBLANCE TO A MUFFLED HUMAN FORM NOW TELL ME I'M A LIAR SAID THE HONEST MAN
ME AND MISSUS BOFFIN WENT TO LOOK AT IT AND FINDING IT BEYOND A DOUBT EMINENTLY ARISTOCRATIC
IT'S NO GOOD THIS SORT OF GAME YOU KNOW YOU MUST COME UP I MEAN TO HAVE YOU THERE WAS SO MUCH VIRTUE IN THIS DISTINCTLY AND DECIDEDLY MEANING TO HAVE IT THAT IT YIELDED A LITTLE EVEN WHILE THE LINE WAS PLAYED I TOLD YOU SO QUOTH MISTER INSPECTOR PULLING OFF HIS OUTER COAT
IN THE SENSE OF STEWARD WHY AS TO STEWARD YOU SEE RETURNED MISTER BOFFIN WITH HIS HAND STILL TO HIS CHIN THE ODDS ARE THAT MISSUS BOFFIN AND ME MAY NEVER GO UPON THE WATER BEING BOTH BAD SAILORS WE SHOULD WANT A STEWARD IF WE DID
I TELL YOU WHAT SAID MISTER BOFFIN SLOWLY CRUMPLING HIS OWN BLOTTED NOTE IN HIS HAND IF YOU'LL TURN TO AT THESE PRESENT PAPERS AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN MAKE OF EM I SHALL KNOW BETTER WHAT I CAN MAKE OF YOU NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE
THEY WERE ALL SHIVERING AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM SEEMED TO BE SHIVERING THE RIVER ITSELF CRAFT RIGGING SAILS SUCH EARLY SMOKE AS THERE YET WAS ON THE SHORE BLACK WITH WET AND ALTERED TO THE EYE BY WHITE PATCHES OF HAIL AND SLEET
DEAD SOME HOURS LAY STRETCHED UPON THE SHORE WITH A NEW BLAST STORMING AT IT AND CLOTTING THE WET HAIR WITH HAIL STONES FATHER WAS THAT YOU CALLING ME FATHER I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU CALL ME TWICE BEFORE
TRY EASY NOW HE TRIED EASY NOW BUT THE LUCK RESISTED WOULDN'T COME I MEAN TO HAVE IT AND THE BOAT TOO SAID MISTER INSPECTOR PLAYING THE LINE BUT STILL THE LUCK RESISTED WOULDN'T COME TAKE CARE SAID RIDERHOOD
IF YOU WOULDN'T OBJECT TO STANDING BY HIM HALF A MINUTE SIR WAS THE REPLY I'LL FIND THE NEAREST OF OUR MEN TO COME AND TAKE CHARGE OF HIM I STILL CALL IT HIM YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR LOOKING BACK AS HE WENT WITH A PHILOSOPHICAL SMILE UPON THE FORCE OF HABIT
YOU'LL HAVE AN APOPLEXY BESIDES IRON MOULDING YOUR LINEN AND YOU'LL BREAK MY HEART MISTER BOFFIN EMBRACED HIS SPOUSE FOR THESE WORDS OF WISDOM AND THEN CONGRATULATING JOHN ROKESMITH ON THE BRILLIANCY OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS
I SHALL THEREFORE CAST ABOUT FOR COMFORTABLE WAYS AND MEANS OF NOT CALLING UP WEGG'S JEALOUSY BUT OF KEEPING YOU IN YOUR DEPARTMENT AND KEEPING HIM IN HIS LOR CRIED MISSUS BOFFIN WHAT I SAY IS THE WORLD'S WIDE ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT NOW AND HE LOOKED ABOUT BUT NO EUGENE WAS IN ALL THE VIEW MISTER INSPECTOR SPEEDILY RETURNING DOWN THE WOODEN STAIRS WITH A POLICE CONSTABLE LIGHTWOOD ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEEN HIS FRIEND LEAVE THEM MISTER INSPECTOR
FOR HE FELT WITH SOME NATURAL INDIGNATION THAT THAT FUNCTIONARY MIGHT OTHERWISE SUSPECT HIM OF HAVING CLOSED HIS EYES OR WANDERED IN HIS ATTENTION HERE JUST BEFORE US YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR I SEE SAID LIGHTWOOD WITH DIGNITY
FIRST I'LL TELL YOU MORE THERE WAS SILVER IN EM HOW DO I MAKE THAT OUT SIMPLE AND SATISFACTORY BECAUSE HE'S GOT IT HERE THE LECTURER HELD UP THE TIGHTLY CLENCHED RIGHT HAND WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THE REMAINS ASKED LIGHTWOOD
AND HAD HOT BRANDY AND WATER TOO YOU SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AND THEN CUT OFF AT A GREAT RATE WHO SAID LIGHTWOOD YOUR FRIEND YOU KNOW I KNOW HE REPLIED AGAIN WITH DIGNITY AFTER HEARING IN A MIST THROUGH WHICH MISTER INSPECTOR LOOMED VAGUE AND LARGE
NOT SO EASY DONE HIS LUCK'S GOT FOULED UNDER THE KEELS OF THE BARGES I TRIED TO HAUL IN LAST TIME BUT I COULDN'T SEE HOW TAUT THE LINE IS
TOOK IT MY LITERARY MAN WAS SO FRIENDLY AS TO DROP INTO A CHARMING PIECE OF POETRY ON THAT OCCASION IN WHICH HE COMPLIMENTED MISSUS BOFFIN ON COMING INTO POSSESSION OF HOW DID IT GO MY DEAR MISSUS BOFFIN REPLIED THE GAY
THAT THE OFFICER TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO PREPARE THE DEAD MAN'S DAUGHTER FOR WHAT HAD BEFALLEN IN THE NIGHT AND GENERALLY THAT HE TOOK EVERYTHING UPON HIMSELF MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD STUMBLED IN HIS SLEEP TO A CAB STAND CALLED A CAB
EUGENE SAID LIGHTWOOD AND WAS ABOUT TO ADD WE MAY WAIT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WHEN TURNING HIS HEAD HE FOUND THAT NO EUGENE WAS THERE HE RAISED HIS VOICE AND CALLED EUGENE HOLLOA BUT NO EUGENE REPLIED
ALL THE OBJECTS AMONG WHICH THEY CREPT WERE SO HUGE IN CONTRAST WITH THEIR WRETCHED BOAT AS TO THREATEN TO CRUSH IT NOT A SHIP'S HULL WITH ITS RUSTY IRON LINKS OF CABLE RUN OUT OF HAWSE HOLES LONG DISCOLOURED WITH THE IRON'S RUSTY TEARS
HE SEES SOME OBJECT THAT'S IN HIS WAY OF BUSINESS FLOATING HE MAKES READY TO SECURE THAT OBJECT HE UNWINDS THE END OF HIS COIL THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE SOME TURNS ON IN HIS BOAT AND HE TAKES TURNS ENOUGH ON IT TO SECURE THAT IT SHAN'T RUN OUT
APPLE PIE ORDER SAID MISTER BOFFIN
WHY WHAT BLOODSHOT DRAGGLED DISHEVELLED SPECTACLE IS THIS CRIED MORTIMER
BUT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW FASHIONABLE WE MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT GROW WELL MISSUS BOFFIN HAS CARRIED THE DAY AND WE'RE GOING IN NECK AND CROP FOR FASHION I RATHER INFERRED THAT SIR REPLIED JOHN ROKESMITH
NOW SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR SEE HOW IT WORKS ROUND UPON HIM IT'S A WILD TEMPESTUOUS EVENING WHEN THIS MAN THAT WAS STOOPING TO WIPE SOME HAILSTONES OUT OF HIS HAIR WITH AN END OF HIS OWN DROWNED JACKET THERE
THAT HE MAY BE SHAMED THE MORE A LULL AND THE WIND IS SECRET AND PRYING WITH HIM LIFTS AND LETS FALLS A RAG HIDES PALPITATING UNDER ANOTHER RAG RUNS NIMBLY THROUGH HIS HAIR AND BEARD
GAVE HIM HIS HAND IN PLEDGE OF THEIR NEW RELATIONS SO DID MISSUS BOFFIN NOW SAID MISTER BOFFIN WHO IN HIS FRANKNESS FELT THAT IT DID NOT BECOME HIM TO HAVE A GENTLEMAN IN HIS EMPLOYMENT FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT REPOSING SOME CONFIDENCE IN HIM
THAT HE HAD HAD HALF A DOZEN DEAD AND ALIVE IN HER AFORE NOW AND SHE WAS NOTHING DEEP IN THE WATER NOR DOWN IN THE STERN EVEN THEN TO SPEAK OF THEY CAREFULLY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND TRIMMED THE CRAZY THING WHILE THEY WERE DOING SO RIDERHOOD STILL SAT STARING DISCONSOLATE
HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU WATER RAT ASTONISHED BY HIS FRIEND'S UNUSUAL HEAT LIGHTWOOD STARED TOO AND THEN SAID WHAT CAN HAVE BECOME OF THIS MAN CAN'T IMAGINE UNLESS HE DIVED OVERBOARD
MISTER INSPECTOR HAVING TO MISTER RIDERHOOD ANNOUNCED HIS OFFICIAL INTENTION OF KEEPING HIS EYE UPON HIM STOOD HIM IN A CORNER OF THE FIREPLACE LIKE A WET UMBRELLA AND TOOK NO FURTHER OUTWARD AND VISIBLE NOTICE OF THAT HONEST MAN
ALL RIGHT GIVE WAY SAID LIGHTWOOD GIVE WAY BY GEORGE REPEATED RIDERHOOD BEFORE SHOVING OFF IF HE'S GONE AND MADE OFF ANY HOW LAWYER LIGHTWOOD IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE ME GIVE WAY IN A DIFFERENT MANNER
IF IT WAS ME THAT HAD THE LAW OF THIS HERE JOB IN HAND GROWLED RIDERHOOD WITH A THREATENING SHAKE OF HIS HEAD BLEST IF I WOULDN'T LAY HOLD OF HER AT ANY RATE AY BUT IT IS NOT YOU SAID EUGENE
BUT CONSIDER SUCH A NIGHT FOR PLUMAGE SUCH A NIGHT REPEATED MORTIMER WHAT BECAME OF YOU IN THE MORNING MY DEAR FELLOW SAID EUGENE SITTING ON HIS BED I FELT THAT WE HAD BORED ONE ANOTHER SO LONG
AND HE LOOKED AT THEM ABOUT AS HOPEFULLY AS AN INNOCENT CIVILIAN MIGHT LOOK AT A CROWD OF TROOPS WHOM HE WAS REQUIRED AT FIVE MINUTES NOTICE TO MANOEUVRE AND REVIEW HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN SOME ATTEMPTS TO MAKE NOTES OF THESE PAPERS BUT BEING TROUBLED AS MEN OF HIS STAMP OFTEN ARE
THE OBJECT HE HAD EXPECTED TO TAKE IN TOW FLOATS BY AND HIS OWN BOAT TOWS HIM DEAD TO WHERE WE FOUND HIM ALL ENTANGLED IN HIS OWN LINE
HE MAKES IT TOO SECURE AS IT HAPPENS HE IS A LITTLE LONGER ABOUT THIS THAN USUAL HIS HANDS BEING NUMBED
WORDS NEVER TO BE ANSWERED THOSE UPON THE EARTH SIDE OF THE GRAVE THE WIND SWEEPS JEERINGLY OVER FATHER WHIPS HIM WITH THE FRAYED ENDS OF HIS DRESS AND HIS JAGGED HAIR
AND YOU WILL OBSERVE NOW THAT THIS KNOT WHICH WAS DRAWN CHOCK TIGHT ROUND HIS NECK BY THE STRAIN OF HIS OWN ARMS IS A SLIP KNOT HOLDING IT UP FOR DEMONSTRATION PLAIN ENOUGH
BUT SEEMED TO BE THERE WITH A FELL INTENTION NOT A FIGURE HEAD BUT HAD THE MENACING LOOK OF BURSTING FORWARD TO RUN THEM DOWN NOT A SLUICE GATE
WE CAN TALK IT OVER NOW CAN'T US MISTER ROKESMITH BOWED THANKED HER AND SAID HE HOPED SO LET ME SEE THEN RESUMED MISTER BOFFIN WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CHIN IT WAS SECRETARY THAT YOU NAMED WASN'T IT
SOME HALF HOUR OF THIS WORK AND RIDERHOOD UNSHIPPED HIS SCULLS STOOD HOLDING ON TO A BARGE AND HAND OVER HAND LONG WISE ALONG THE BARGE'S SIDE GRADUALLY WORKED HIS BOAT UNDER HER HEAD INTO A SECRET LITTLE NOOK OF SCUMMY WATER
ACCEPTANCE OF MISTER BOFFIN'S OFFER OF SUCH A DATE AND TO SUCH AN EFFECT REJECTION OF MISTER BOFFIN'S PROPOSAL OF SUCH A DATE AND TO SUCH AN EFFECT CONCERNING MISTER BOFFIN'S SCHEME OF SUCH ANOTHER DATE TO SUCH ANOTHER EFFECT ALL COMPACT AND METHODICAL
THAT AN UNBROKEN CONTINUANCE OF THOSE RELATIONS MUST INEVITABLY TERMINATE IN OUR FLYING TO OPPOSITE POINTS OF THE EARTH I ALSO FELT THAT I HAD COMMITTED EVERY CRIME IN THE NEWGATE CALENDAR SO FOR MINGLED CONSIDERATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP AND FELONY
SOMETIMES IT LAY IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS BOAT SOMETIMES HE HUNG IT LOOSE ROUND HIS NECK HE WAS A LIGHT DRESSER WAS THIS MAN YOU SEE LIFTING THE LOOSE NECKERCHIEF OVER HIS BREAST AND TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY OF WIPING THE DEAD LIPS WITH IT
AS MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD SAT BEFORE THE BLAZING FIRE CONSCIOUS OF DRINKING BRANDY AND WATER THEN AND THERE IN HIS SLEEP AND YET AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME DRINKING BURNT SHERRY AT THE SIX JOLLY FELLOWSHIPS AND LYING UNDER THE BOAT ON THE RIVER SHORE AND SITTING IN THE BOAT THAT RIDERHOOD ROWED
HIS DIRECTIONS WERE OBEYED AND THEY PULLED ASHORE DIRECTLY TWO IN ONE BOAT TWO IN THE OTHER NOW SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AGAIN TO RIDERHOOD WHEN THEY WERE ALL ON THE SLUSHY STONES YOU HAVE HAD MORE PRACTICE IN THIS THAN I HAVE HAD
AND OUGHT TO BE A BETTER WORKMAN AT IT UNDO THE TOW ROPE AND WE'LL HELP YOU HAUL IN RIDERHOOD GOT INTO THE BOAT ACCORDINGLY IT APPEARED AS IF HE HAD SCARCELY HAD A MOMENT'S TIME TO TOUCH THE ROPE OR LOOK OVER THE STERN
AND HARD WORK HOLDING FORTH AT THAT IMMEASURABLE LENGTH TO EUGENE WHEN HE HAD BEEN RESCUED WITH A ROPE FROM THE RUNNING PAVEMENT FOR MAKING OFF IN THAT EXTRAORDINARY MANNER BUT HE OFFERED SUCH AMPLE APOLOGIES AND WAS SO VERY PENITENT
FROM THE SCALE ON WHICH YOUR NEW ESTABLISHMENT IS TO BE MAINTAINED YES SAID MISTER BOFFIN IT'S TO BE A SPANKER THE FACT IS MY LITERARY MAN NAMED TO ME THAT A HOUSE WITH WHICH HE IS AS I MAY SAY
AFTER CERTAIN MINUTES AND A FEW DIRECTIONS TO THE REST TO EASE HER A LITTLE FOR'ARD AND NOW EASE HER A TRIFLE AFT AND THE LIKE HE SAID COMPOSEDLY ALL CLEAR AND THE LINE AND THE BOAT CAME FREE TOGETHER
SPEAK FATHER SPEAK TO US THE WINDS THE ONLY LISTENERS LEFT YOU NOW SEE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR AFTER MATURE DELIBERATION KNEELING ON ONE KNEE BESIDE THE BODY WHEN THEY HAD STOOD LOOKING DOWN ON THE DROWNED MAN
WHEN HE CAME SCRAMBLING BACK AS PALE AS THE MORNING AND GASPED OUT BY THE LORD HE'S DONE ME
LOOK AT THE BROKEN SCULL LOOK AT THE T'OTHER SCULL GONE NOW TELL ME I AM A LIAR SAID THE HONEST MAN MISTER INSPECTOR STEPPED INTO THE BOAT EUGENE AND MORTIMER LOOKED ON AND SEE NOW
THE BIRD OF PREY BROUGHT DOWN COLD ON THE SHORE IN THE RAW COLD OF THAT LEADEN CRISIS IN THE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS WHEN THE VITAL FORCE OF ALL THE NOBLEST AND PRETTIEST THINGS THAT LIVE IS AT ITS LOWEST
HE CAN SWIM CAN THIS MAN AND INSTANTLY HE STRIKES OUT
COULD NOT EXACTLY SAY THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM GO BUT HAD NOTICED THAT HE WAS RESTLESS SINGULAR AND ENTERTAINING COMBINATION SIR YOUR FRIEND
AS A VERY REMARKABLE MONUMENT OF HUMAN INGENUITY AND I TELL YOU MY DEARY SAID MISSUS BOFFIN THAT IF YOU DON'T CLOSE WITH MISTER ROKESMITH NOW AT ONCE AND IF YOU EVER GO A MUDDLING YOURSELF AGAIN WITH THINGS NEVER MEANT NOR MADE FOR YOU
TWO NEW SERVANTS MISTER AND MISSUS BOFFIN SAT AFTER BREAKFAST IN THE BOWER A PREY TO PROSPERITY MISTER BOFFIN'S FACE DENOTED CARE AND COMPLICATION MANY DISORDERED PAPERS WERE BEFORE HIM
BUT THERE'S GENERALLY ONE PROVIDED MISTER ROKESMITH AGAIN EXPLAINED DEFINING THE DUTIES HE SOUGHT TO UNDERTAKE AS THOSE OF GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT OR MANAGER OR OVERLOOKER OR MAN OF BUSINESS NOW FOR INSTANCE COME
AND WHATEVER YOU DO WITH YOUR INK I CAN'T THINK FOR YOU'RE AS CLEAN AS A WHISTLE AFTER IT NOW AS TO A LETTER LET'S SAID MISTER BOFFIN RUBBING HIS HANDS IN HIS PLEASANTLY CHILDISH ADMIRATION LET'S TRY A LETTER NEXT
WELL NOW NODDY CRIED MISSUS BOFFIN CLAPPING HER HANDS THAT IS A GOOD ONE MISTER BOFFIN WAS NO LESS DELIGHTED INDEED IN HIS OWN BOSOM HE REGARDED BOTH THE COMPOSITION ITSELF AND THE DEVICE THAT HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO IT
DISCOLOURED COPPER ROTTEN WOOD HONEY COMBED STONE GREEN DANK DEPOSIT THAT THE AFTER CONSEQUENCES OF BEING CRUSHED SUCKED UNDER AND DRAWN DOWN LOOKED AS UGLY TO THE IMAGINATION AS THE MAIN EVENT
THE HUDDLED BUILDINGS LOOKED LOWER THAN USUAL AS IF THEY WERE COWERING AND HAD SHRUNK WITH THE COLD VERY LITTLE LIFE WAS TO BE SEEN ON EITHER BANK WINDOWS AND DOORS WERE SHUT
LAST EVENING HE DOES THIS WORSE FOR HIM HE DODGES ABOUT IN HIS BOAT DOES THIS MAN TILL HE GETS CHILLED HIS HANDS TAKING UP ONE OF THEM WHICH DROPPED LIKE A LEADEN WEIGHT GET NUMBED
BENDS RIGHT OVER THE STERN AND IN ONE OF THESE HEAVY SQUALLS OR IN THE CROSS SWELL OF TWO STEAMERS OR IN NOT BEING QUITE PREPARED OR THROUGH ALL OR MOST OR SOME GETS A LURCH OVERBALANCES AND GOES HEAD FOREMOST OVERBOARD NOW SEE
IF YOU ENTERED MY EMPLOYMENT WHAT WOULD YOU DO I WOULD KEEP EXACT ACCOUNTS OF ALL THE EXPENDITURE YOU SANCTIONED MISTER BOFFIN I WOULD WRITE YOUR LETTERS UNDER YOUR DIRECTION
HE POINTED BEHIND HIM AT THE BOAT AND GASPED TO THAT DEGREE THAT HE DROPPED UPON THE STONES TO GET HIS BREATH GAFFER'S DONE ME IT'S GAFFER THEY RAN TO THE ROPE LEAVING HIM GASPING THERE SOON THE FORM OF THE BIRD OF PREY
IT WAS FAINTER AND DULLER PERHAPS FIRE LIKE THE HIGHER ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE IT HELPS TO SUSTAIN HAS ITS GREATEST TENDENCY TOWARDS DEATH WHEN THE NIGHT IS DYING AND THE DAY IS NOT YET BORN
WITH AN EXCEEDINGLY DISTRUSTFUL AND CORRECTIVE THUMB
AS HE HAD MANY A TIME LOOKED DOWN ON MANY ANOTHER MAN THE WAY OF IT WAS THIS OF COURSE YOU GENTLEMEN HARDLY FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT HE WAS TOWING BY THE NECK AND ARMS THEY HAD HELPED TO RELEASE THE ROPE AND OF COURSE NOT
THAT HE DROPPED UNDER THE LEE OF A TIER OF SHIPPING AND THEY LAY THERE UNTIL IT WAS OVER THE SQUALL HAD COME UP LIKE A SPITEFUL MESSENGER BEFORE THE MORNING THERE FOLLOWED IN ITS WAKE A RAGGED TEAR OF LIGHT WHICH RIPPED THE DARK CLOUDS UNTIL THEY SHOWED A GREAT GREY HOLE OF DAY
INTO THE WONDERFUL MYSTIC TWILIGHT LAND WHERE LIE THE GREAT ADVENTURES AND THE GREAT REWARDS BEHOLD ME THEN AT THE OFFICE OF THE DAILY GAZETTE ON THE STAFF OF WHICH I WAS A MOST INSIGNIFICANT UNIT
AND LED TO SANGUINARY REPRISALS ON THE PART OF THE DUTCH SOLDIERY
THERE'S ONE MAN WHO IS STILL YOUR MASTER
BUT FORTUNATELY I WAS RESCUED FROM AN ODIOUS SITUATION A POLICEMAN WAS BESIDE US HIS NOTEBOOK IN HIS HAND WHAT'S ALL THIS YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED SAID THE POLICEMAN IT WAS THE MOST RATIONAL REMARK WHICH I HAD HEARD IN ENMORE PARK
AS TO YOUR SUGGESTION THAT I MAY MODIFY MY OPINION I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT IT IS NOT MY HABIT TO DO SO AFTER A DELIBERATE EXPRESSION OF MY MATURE VIEWS YOU WILL KINDLY SHOW THE ENVELOPE OF THIS LETTER TO MY MAN AUSTIN WHEN YOU CALL
I SUPPOSE IT WASN'T ABOUT SOUTH AMERICA YOU WANTED TO SEE HIM I COULD NOT LIE TO A LADY DEAR ME THAT IS HIS MOST DANGEROUS SUBJECT YOU WON'T BELIEVE A WORD HE SAYS I'M SURE I DON'T WONDER
YOU WERE IN TROUBLE LAST MONTH FOR THE SAME THING YOU'VE BLACKENED THIS YOUNG MAN'S EYE
GLADYS WAS FULL OF EVERY WOMANLY QUALITY SOME JUDGED HER TO BE COLD AND HARD BUT SUCH A THOUGHT WAS TREASON THAT DELICATELY BRONZED SKIN
JUST A CLERK AND HE CONQUERED INDIA BY GEORGE I'LL DO SOMETHING IN THE WORLD YET SHE LAUGHED AT MY SUDDEN IRISH EFFERVESCENCE WHY NOT SHE SAID YOU HAVE EVERYTHING A MAN COULD HAVE
IT'S DEEPER MY CHARACTER SHE NODDED SEVERELY WHAT CAN I DO TO MEND IT DO SIT DOWN AND TALK IT OVER NO REALLY I WON'T IF YOU'LL ONLY SIT DOWN SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A WONDERING DISTRUST
I'LL TROUBLE YOU TO KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF SIR I'LL NOT STAND IT DEAR ME HIS BLACK MOUSTACHE LIFTED AND A WHITE FANG TWINKLED IN A SNEER
HE GLARED AT ME AS THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BEAST THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEHAVED ABOMINABLY SAID I I ASSURE YOU THAT I CAN FIGHT MY OWN BATTLES AND THAT I HAVE NO POSSIBLE NEED OF YOUR SYMPATHY
THE OBJECT BEING TO PREVENT THE BRITISH FLEET FROM SEIZING FLUSHING IN THE EVENT OF THE OUTBREAK OF AN ANGLO GERMAN WAR THE PRESS AGITATION MET HOWEVER WITH NO COUNTENANCE ON THE PART OF RESPONSIBLE STATESMEN IN ANY OF THE COUNTRIES NAMED
IT WAS AN IMPOSING PORTICOED HOUSE AT WHICH WE STOPPED AND THE HEAVILY CURTAINED WINDOWS GAVE EVERY INDICATION OF WEALTH UPON THE PART OF THIS FORMIDABLE PROFESSOR THE DOOR WAS OPENED BY AN ODD SWARTHY DRIED UP PERSON OF UNCERTAIN AGE
IT WAS HIS SIZE WHICH TOOK ONE'S BREATH AWAY HIS SIZE AND HIS IMPOSING PRESENCE HIS HEAD WAS ENORMOUS
THAT WAS BRAVE OF YOU I HAD TO IF YOU WANT TO WRITE GOOD COPY YOU MUST BE WHERE THE THINGS ARE WHAT A PROSAIC MOTIVE IT SEEMS TO TAKE ALL THE ROMANCE OUT OF IT BUT STILL
I AM CONVINCED THAT HE REALLY BELIEVED IN HIS HEART THAT I CAME ROUND TO THE CHESTNUTS THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR THE PLEASURE OF HIS COMPANY
BUT IF IT REALLY NEEDS AMPLIFICATION I SHALL CONSENT TO SEE YOU AT THE HOUR NAMED THOUGH VISITS
FOR IT IS ONLY WHEN A MAN GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THERE ARE HEROISMS ALL ROUND HIM AND WITH THE DESIRE ALL ALIVE IN HIS HEART TO FOLLOW ANY WHICH MAY COME WITHIN SIGHT OF HIM
CHAPTER THREE HE IS A PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE PERSON MY FRIEND'S FEAR OR HOPE WAS NOT DESTINED TO BE REALIZED WHEN I CALLED ON WEDNESDAY THERE WAS A LETTER WITH THE WEST KENSINGTON POSTMARK UPON IT
AND PERFECTLY UNSEXUAL MY INSTINCTS ARE ALL AGAINST A WOMAN BEING TOO FRANK AND AT HER EASE WITH ME IT IS NO COMPLIMENT TO A MAN WHERE THE REAL SEX FEELING BEGINS TIMIDITY AND DISTRUST ARE ITS COMPANIONS
I COULD HAVE BOLTED FOR THE HALL DOOR BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO IGNOMINIOUS BESIDES A LITTLE GLOW OF RIGHTEOUS ANGER WAS SPRINGING UP WITHIN ME I HAD BEEN HOPELESSLY IN THE WRONG BEFORE BUT THIS MAN'S MENACES WERE PUTTING ME IN THE RIGHT
WHY SURELY I CRIED AND GLORIED IN MY OWN AUDACITY BUT WHAT DOES THAT PROVE
UPON WHICH HE JUMPED FROM HIS CHAIR REPROVED ME FOR MY HABITUAL LEVITY WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DISCUSS ANY REASONABLE SUBJECT IN MY PRESENCE AND BOUNCED OFF OUT OF THE ROOM TO DRESS FOR A MASONIC MEETING
AND SO IT WAS THAT I FOUND MYSELF THAT FOGGY NOVEMBER EVENING PURSUING THE CAMBERWELL TRAM WITH MY HEART GLOWING WITHIN ME AND WITH THE EAGER DETERMINATION THAT NOT ANOTHER DAY SHOULD ELAPSE
THE THREAT WAS MET WITH FIRMNESS AN ANTI STRIKE LAW WAS QUICKLY PASSED THE MILITARY WAS CALLED OUT AND THE STRIKE COLLAPSED
LIBERALS OF ALL GROUPS THIRTY NINE SOCIALISTS FIFTEEN THE MOST STRIKING CHANGE WAS THE INCREASE IN THE SOCIALIST VOTE THEIR REPRESENTATION BEING MORE THAN DOUBLED
THE LIBERAL MINISTRY AT LEAST DESERVES CREDIT FOR HAVING STEERED THE COUNTRY SAFELY THROUGH PERILOUS WATERS
DRIVING THIS LITTLE FLOCK BEFORE HIM THE PROFESSOR LOOKED AT ME AND THERE WAS SOMETHING HUMOROUS AT THE BACK OF HIS EYES COME IN SAID HE I'VE NOT DONE WITH YOU YET
SHE HAD SPRUNG FROM HER CHAIR AS SHE SAW SIGNS THAT I PROPOSED TO DEMONSTRATE SOME OF MY WANTS YOU'VE SPOILED EVERYTHING NED SHE SAID IT'S ALL SO BEAUTIFUL AND NATURAL UNTIL THIS KIND OF THING COMES IN
IT LED NEVERTHELESS TO THE ABANDONMENT OF THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL AND THE PASSING OF A BILL IN NINETEEN TWELVE FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE DEFENCES OF THE DUTCH SEA PORTS GENERALLY
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THAT OFFICIAL CAME INTO THE MATTER BUT IN HE TROTTED AND SET US BOTH LAUGHING THAT DOES NOT SATISFY ME IN THE LEAST I WANT MY ARMS ROUND YOU AND YOUR HEAD ON MY BREAST AND OH GLADYS I WANT
I MUST KEEP UP MY DECEPTION FOR AT LEAST A LITTLE TIME LONGER OTHERWISE HERE WAS EVIDENTLY AN END OF THE INTERVIEW YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE ME AN APPOINTMENT SIR SAID I HUMBLY PRODUCING HIS ENVELOPE
WHY CAN'T YOU CONTROL YOURSELF
AND POSSESSED NO INDEPENDENT MAJORITY IN EITHER CHAMBER FOR THE FIRST TIME A MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY AND TRADE WAS CREATED SUCH AN ADMINISTRATION COULD ONLY LEAD A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE
IT HAD SEEMED SIMPLE ENOUGH AT A DISTANCE OH MY IRISH WITS COULD THEY NOT HELP ME NOW WHEN I NEEDED HELP SO SORELY HE TRANSFIXED ME WITH TWO SHARP STEELY EYES COME COME HE RUMBLED
VERY CRITICAL AND VERY MASTERFUL A HUGE SPREAD OF SHOULDERS AND A CHEST LIKE A BARREL WERE THE OTHER PARTS OF HIM WHICH APPEARED ABOVE THE TABLE SAVE FOR TWO ENORMOUS HANDS COVERED WITH LONG BLACK HAIR
IN A CONFLICT WHICH PLACED THEM IN A MOST DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS POSITION ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS ON WHICH THEY HAD TO TAKE A CRITICAL DECISION WAS THE CLOSING OF THE SCHELDT AS SOON AS GREAT BRITAIN DECLARED WAR ON GERMANY AUGUST FOURTH
ONE MUST WAIT TILL IT COMES BUT WHY CAN'T YOU LOVE ME GLADYS IS IT MY APPEARANCE OR WHAT SHE DID UNBEND A LITTLE SHE PUT FORWARD A HAND SUCH A GRACIOUS STOOPING ATTITUDE IT WAS
AND HE FELL IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSSIA THAT WAS THE KIND OF MAN I MEAN THINK OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED AND HOW OTHER WOMEN MUST HAVE ENVIED HER THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ENVIED FOR MY MAN I'D HAVE DONE IT TO PLEASE YOU
WHATEVER YOUR MOTIVE I AM GLAD THAT YOU WENT DOWN THAT MINE SHE GAVE ME HER HAND BUT WITH SUCH SWEETNESS AND DIGNITY THAT I COULD ONLY STOOP AND KISS IT I DARE SAY
I AM OF COURSE A MERE STUDENT SAID I WITH A FATUOUS SMILE HARDLY MORE I MIGHT SAY THAN AN EARNEST INQUIRER AT THE SAME TIME IT SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU WERE A LITTLE SEVERE UPON WEISSMANN IN THIS MATTER
HERITAGE FROM OLD WICKED DAYS WHEN LOVE AND VIOLENCE WENT OFTEN HAND IN HAND THE BENT HEAD THE AVERTED EYE THE FALTERING VOICE THE WINCING FIGURE THESE
BEFORE I SHOULD FIND SOME DEED WHICH WAS WORTHY OF MY LADY BUT WHO WHO IN ALL THIS WIDE WORLD COULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED THE INCREDIBLE SHAPE WHICH THAT DEED WAS TO TAKE OR THE STRANGE STEPS BY WHICH I WAS LED TO THE DOING OF IT
HIS HEAD NOT HIGHER THAN MY SHOULDER A STUNTED HERCULES WHOSE TREMENDOUS VITALITY HAD ALL RUN TO DEPTH BREADTH AND BRAIN GIBBERISH HE CRIED LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE TABLE AND HIS FACE PROJECTING
WITH SOME DIFFICULTY DOCTOR CORT VAN DEN LINDEN SUCCEEDED IN FORMING A LIBERAL MINISTRY THE OUTBREAK OF THE GREAT WAR IN AUGUST NINETEEN FOURTEEN
AND THERE WAS NEVER ANY BREACH IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE NETHERLANDS THE MARRIAGE OF QUEEN WILHELMINA ON FEBRUARY SEVENTH NINETEEN O ONE WITH PRINCE HENRY OF MECKLENBURG SCHWERIN WAS WELCOMED BY THE PEOPLE
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUCH EXTRAORDINARY NOTIONS OF HUMOR IT WAS NEARLY HALF PAST TEN BEFORE I HAD RECEIVED MY MESSAGE BUT A TAXICAB TOOK ME ROUND IN GOOD TIME FOR MY APPOINTMENT
SO FAR MY THOUGHTS HAD CARRIED ME AND I WAS ABOUT TO BREAK THE LONG AND UNEASY SILENCE WHEN TWO CRITICAL DARK EYES LOOKED ROUND AT ME AND THE PROUD HEAD WAS SHAKEN IN SMILING REPROOF
BUT CHANCES ARE ALL AROUND YOU
TH HEEMSKERK UNDERTOOK THE TASK OF FORMING A NEW CABINET FROM THE ANTI REVOLUTIONARY AND CATHOLIC GROUPS
YOUTH HEALTH STRENGTH EDUCATION ENERGY I WAS SORRY YOU SPOKE AND NOW I AM GLAD SO GLAD IF IT WAKENS THESE THOUGHTS IN YOU AND IF I DO
WITH THE RESULT THAT IT WAS WITHDRAWN A PROPOSAL MADE BY THIS MINISTRY IN NINETEEN TEN TO SPEND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION FLORINS ON THE FORTIFICATION OF FLUSHING EXCITED MUCH ADVERSE CRITICISM IN THE PRESS OF BELGIUM ENGLAND AND FRANCE
AND FEAR OF REPULSE ALTERNATING IN HIS MIND SHE SAT WITH THAT PROUD DELICATE PROFILE OF HERS OUTLINED AGAINST THE RED CURTAIN HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS AND YET HOW ALOOF
AS AFFORDING HOPES FOR SOME YEARS TO BE DISAPPOINTED OF THE BIRTH OF AN HEIR TO THE THRONE THE ELECTIONS OF NINETEEN O ONE FOUND THE LIBERAL MINISTRY OUT OF FAVOUR THROUGH THE LAWS ENFORCING MILITARY SERVICE AND OBLIGATORY ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL
I ASKED IN GENUINE WONDER DON'T WOMEN ALWAYS KNOW DO YOU SUPPOSE ANY WOMAN IN THE WORLD WAS EVER TAKEN UNAWARES BUT OH NED OUR FRIENDSHIP HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND SO PLEASANT
WHO ARRIVED IN HOLLAND AS A FUGITIVE
PROBABLY IN NO COUNTRY HAS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SWING OF THE PENDULUM BEEN SO SYSTEMATICALLY VERIFIED AS IT HAS IN HOLLAND IN RECENT TIMES THE RETURNS WERE IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN CHURCH PARTIES FORTY ONE
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE AWARE SAID HE CHECKING OFF POINTS UPON HIS FINGERS THAT THE CRANIAL INDEX IS A CONSTANT FACTOR NATURALLY SAID
WE DID A CATHARINE WHEEL TOGETHER DOWN THE PASSAGE SOMEHOW WE GATHERED UP A CHAIR UPON OUR WAY AND BOUNDED ON WITH IT TOWARDS THE STREET
SPADE SHAPED AND RIPPLING DOWN OVER HIS CHEST THE HAIR WAS PECULIAR PLASTERED DOWN IN FRONT IN A LONG CURVING WISP OVER HIS MASSIVE FOREHEAD THE EYES WERE BLUE GRAY UNDER GREAT BLACK TUFTS VERY CLEAR
THE CONTENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS ENMORE PARK W SIR
WHICH WAS MUCH MORE TO MY MIND THAN HER WHOLE HEARTED CONFIDENCE HOW PRIMITIVE AND BESTIAL IT LOOKS WHEN YOU PUT IT DOWN IN BLACK AND WHITE AND PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT IS ONLY A FEELING PECULIAR TO MYSELF ANYHOW SHE SAT DOWN
AT LAST I WAS ALONE WITH GLADYS AND THE MOMENT OF FATE HAD COME ALL THAT EVENING I HAD FELT LIKE THE SOLDIER WHO AWAITS THE SIGNAL WHICH WILL SEND HIM ON A FORLORN HOPE HOPE OF VICTORY
VARIOUS ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE TO INTRODUCE PROTECTIONIST DUTIES BUT UNSUCCESSFULLY
NOW TELL ME WHAT'S AMISS WITH ME I'M IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SAID SHE IT WAS MY TURN TO JUMP OUT OF MY CHAIR
NOW SIR WHY SHOULD YOU NOT FOLLOW YOUR BRETHREN I RATHER THINK YOU MUST HE RESUMED HIS UNPLEASANT AND STEALTHY ADVANCE POINTING HIS TOES AS HE WALKED LIKE A DANCING MASTER
BUT I WAS SADLY CONSCIOUS THAT UP TO NOW I HAD NEVER FOUND THE SECRET OF DRAWING IT FORTH HOWEVER COME WHAT MIGHT I SHOULD HAVE DONE WITH SUSPENSE AND BRING MATTERS TO A HEAD TO NIGHT SHE COULD BUT REFUSE ME
ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL UP TO THE AGE OF THIRTEEN WAS MADE OBLIGATORY
IF YOU FIND HIM DANGEROUS REALLY DANGEROUS RING THE BELL AND HOLD HIM OFF UNTIL I COME EVEN AT HIS WORST I CAN USUALLY CONTROL HIM WITH THESE ENCOURAGING WORDS THE LADY HANDED ME OVER TO THE TACITURN AUSTIN
HE HAD THE FACE AND BEARD WHICH I ASSOCIATE WITH AN ASSYRIAN BULL THE FORMER FLORID
FORFEIT MY GOOD MISTER MALONE I CLAIM FORFEIT YOU HAVE PLAYED A RATHER DANGEROUS GAME AND IT STRIKES ME THAT YOU HAVE LOST IT LOOK HERE SIR SAID I BACKING TO THE DOOR AND OPENING IT
YOU CAN BE AS ABUSIVE AS YOU LIKE BUT THERE IS A LIMIT YOU SHALL NOT ASSAULT ME SHALL I NOT HE WAS SLOWLY ADVANCING IN A PECULIARLY MENACING WAY
DOCTOR KUYPER RESIGNED AND A NEW MINISTRY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MODERATE LIBERAL DE MEESTER TOOK ITS PLACE THE DE MEESTER GOVERNMENT WAS HOWEVER DEPENDENT UPON THE SOCIALIST VOTE
FOR THINGS ARE SO MUCH NICER AS THEY ARE I DREW MY CHAIR A LITTLE NEARER NOW
DEALT WITH MANY SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE PERSONAL MILITARY SERVICE WAS AT LAST AFTER YEARS OF CONTROVERSY ENFORCED BY LAW
YOU HAVE VENTURED TO USE THE WORD SPECULATION WITH REGARD TO MY STATEMENT UPON THE SUBJECT OF DARWINISM AND I WOULD CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT SUCH A WORD IN SUCH A CONNECTION IS OFFENSIVE TO A DEGREE THE CONTEXT CONVINCES ME HOWEVER
THE YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE WAS MEMORABLE FOR THE MEETING OF THE FIRST PEACE CONGRESS
PERHAPS IF BOTH LOVE IT MAY BE DIFFERENT I HAVE NEVER FELT IT BUT YOU MUST
COULD YOU NOT HAVE GONE DOWN AND HELPED THOSE PEOPLE IN SPITE OF THE CHOKE DAMP I DID YOU NEVER SAID SO THERE WAS NOTHING WORTH BUCKING ABOUT I DIDN'T KNOW SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH RATHER MORE INTEREST
I AM MERELY A FOOLISH WOMAN WITH A YOUNG GIRL'S FANCIES AND YET IT IS SO REAL WITH ME SO ENTIRELY PART OF MY VERY SELF THAT I CANNOT HELP ACTING UPON IT IF I MARRY I DO WANT TO MARRY A FAMOUS MAN
WHO HAD WAITED LIKE A BRONZE STATUE OF DISCRETION DURING OUR SHORT INTERVIEW AND I WAS CONDUCTED TO THE END OF THE PASSAGE THERE WAS A TAP AT A DOOR A BULL'S BELLOW FROM WITHIN AND I WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE PROFESSOR
AND LASTED UNTIL JUNE TWENTY NINTH BY THE IRONY OF EVENTS A FEW MONTHS LATER OCTOBER TENTH A WAR BROKE OUT IN WHICH THE DUTCH PEOPLE FELT A GREAT AND SYMPATHETIC INTEREST
AND LADY STANLEY DID YOU EVER READ THE WONDERFUL LAST CHAPTER OF THAT BOOK ABOUT HER HUSBAND THESE ARE THE SORT OF MEN THAT A WOMAN COULD WORSHIP WITH ALL HER SOUL AND YET BE THE GREATER NOT THE LESS ON ACCOUNT OF HER LOVE

HIS ONLY REMARK WAS
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT MERELY TO PLEASE ME YOU SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF BECAUSE IT'S NATURAL TO YOU BECAUSE THE MAN IN YOU IS CRYING OUT FOR HEROIC EXPRESSION NOW WHEN YOU DESCRIBED THE WIGAN COAL EXPLOSION LAST MONTH
WHO STEPPED OUT FROM WHAT PROVED TO BE THE DINING ROOM DOOR SHE WAS A BRIGHT VIVACIOUS DARK EYED LADY MORE FRENCH THAN ENGLISH IN HER TYPE ONE MOMENT SHE SAID YOU CAN WAIT AUSTIN STEP IN HERE SIR MAY I ASK IF YOU HAVE MET MY HUSBAND BEFORE
WHO COULD LOOK DEATH IN THE FACE AND HAVE NO FEAR OF HIM A MAN OF GREAT DEEDS AND STRANGE EXPERIENCES IT IS NEVER A MAN THAT I SHOULD LOVE
I GRIPPED MYSELF HARD AND WENT ON WITH THE ARGUMENT WE CAN'T ALL BE STANLEYS AND BURTONS SAID I BESIDES WE DON'T GET THE CHANCE AT LEAST I NEVER HAD THE CHANCE IF I DID I SHOULD TRY TO TAKE IT
FEATHERY UNTIDY COCKATOO OF A MAN PERFECTLY GOOD NATURED BUT ABSOLUTELY CENTERED UPON HIS OWN SILLY SELF IF ANYTHING COULD HAVE DRIVEN ME FROM GLADYS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE THOUGHT OF SUCH A FATHER IN LAW
THE PIERSON BORGESIUS MINISTRY HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN OFFICE WHEN QUEEN WILHELMINA ATTAINED HER MAJORITY AUGUST THIRTY FIRST EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT AMIDST PUBLIC ENTHUSIASM
ALMOST ORIENTAL IN ITS COLORING THAT RAVEN HAIR THE LARGE LIQUID EYES THE FULL BUT EXQUISITE LIPS ALL THE STIGMATA OF PASSION WERE THERE
AND AFTER ALL THIS OPENING CHAPTER WILL SEEM TO THE READER TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MY NARRATIVE AND YET THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO NARRATIVE WITHOUT IT
THE DEPRECIATION OF THE RUPEE AND THE TRUE STANDARDS OF EXCHANGE SUPPOSE HE CRIED WITH FEEBLE VIOLENCE THAT ALL THE DEBTS IN THE WORLD WERE CALLED UP SIMULTANEOUSLY
DON'T LET US HAVE ANY MORE SUCH GOINGS ON SAID HE NOW THEN MOVE ON THERE MOVE ON THIS TO A BUTCHER'S BOY A MAID AND ONE OR TWO LOAFERS WHO HAD COLLECTED HE CLUMPED HEAVILY DOWN THE STREET
IN SUPPORT OF RELIGIOUS TEACHING IN THE SCHOOLS THE VICTORY LAY WITH THE COALITION
HAD SUCCEEDED IN UNITING THE THREE CHURCH GROUPS THE DEMOCRATIC ANTI REVOLUTIONARIES THE ARISTOCRATIC HISTORICAL CHRISTIANS BOTH ORTHODOX CALVINISTS AND THE CATHOLICS OF ALL SECTIONS INTO A CHRISTIAN COALITION
TO INCREASE CONSIDERABLY THE EXISTING DUTIES AND TO EXTEND LARGELY THE LIST OF DUTIABLE IMPORTS THIS BILL LED TO A WIDESPREAD AGITATION IN THE COUNTRY AND MANY PETITIONS WERE PRESENTED AGAINST IT
ONLY AN IDEAL I'VE NEVER MET THE KIND OF MAN I MEAN TELL ME ABOUT HIM WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE OH HE MIGHT LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE YOU HOW DEAR OF YOU TO SAY THAT WELL
I HAVE SEEN THE TWO MACS ATTEMPT SOMETHING OF THE KIND AT THE HALLS BUT IT APPEARS TO TAKE SOME PRACTISE TO DO IT WITHOUT HURTING ONESELF THE CHAIR WENT TO MATCHWOOD AT THE BOTTOM AND WE ROLLED APART INTO THE GUTTER
THIS AND A BELLOWING ROARING RUMBLING VOICE MADE UP MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE NOTORIOUS PROFESSOR CHALLENGER WELL SAID HE WITH A MOST INSOLENT STARE WHAT NOW
BE SUCH A FOOL PROFESSOR I CRIED WHAT CAN YOU HOPE FOR I'M FIFTEEN STONE AS HARD AS NAILS AND PLAY CENTER THREE QUARTER EVERY SATURDAY FOR THE LONDON IRISH I'M NOT THE MAN IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT HE RUSHED ME
WHAT A PITY TO SPOIL IT DON'T YOU FEEL HOW SPLENDID IT IS THAT A YOUNG MAN AND A YOUNG WOMAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK FACE TO FACE AS WE HAVE TALKED I DON'T KNOW GLADYS YOU SEE I CAN TALK FACE TO FACE WITH WITH THE STATION MASTER
HAS NOT THE GENERAL EVIDENCE SINCE THAT DATE TENDED TO WELL TO STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION WHAT EVIDENCE HE SPOKE WITH A MENACING CALM WELL OF COURSE
I AM SURE THAT HIS TOP HAT
BUT DON'T TELL HIM SO FOR IT MAKES HIM VERY VIOLENT PRETEND TO BELIEVE HIM AND YOU MAY GET THROUGH ALL RIGHT REMEMBER HE BELIEVES IT HIMSELF OF THAT YOU MAY BE ASSURED A MORE HONEST MAN NEVER LIVED
EVEN IN MY SHORT LIFE I HAD LEARNED AS MUCH AS THAT
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO YOU SIR SCIENTIFIC GIBBERISH DID YOU THINK YOU COULD MATCH CUNNING WITH ME YOU WITH YOUR WALNUT OF A BRAIN YOU THINK YOU ARE OMNIPOTENT YOU INFERNAL SCRIBBLERS DON'T YOU
HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET WAVING HIS FISTS AND WHEEZING LIKE AN ASTHMATIC
AND SHE PRESSED BACK MY HEAD THEN SHE LOOKED INTO MY UPTURNED FACE WITH A VERY WISTFUL SMILE NO IT ISN'T THAT SHE SAID AT LAST YOU'RE NOT A CONCEITED BOY BY NATURE
ONLY I HADN'T THE HEART TO REMIND YOU SOME DAY PERHAPS
A SUBJECT UPON WHICH HE WAS BY WAY OF BEING AN AUTHORITY FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THAT EVENING I LISTENED TO HIS MONOTONOUS CHIRRUP ABOUT BAD MONEY DRIVING OUT GOOD THE TOKEN VALUE OF SILVER
IT IS MOST CONSIDERATE OF YOU MADAM GET QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM IF HE SEEMS INCLINED TO BE VIOLENT DON'T WAIT TO ARGUE WITH HIM SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED THROUGH DOING THAT AFTERWARDS THERE IS A PUBLIC SCANDAL AND IT REFLECTS UPON ME AND ALL OF US
WITH A DARK PILOT JACKET AND BROWN LEATHER GAITERS I FOUND AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS THE CHAUFFEUR WHO FILLED THE GAPS LEFT BY A SUCCESSION OF FUGITIVE BUTLERS HE LOOKED ME UP AND DOWN WITH A SEARCHING LIGHT BLUE EYE EXPECTED
HE PANTED YOU INFERNAL BULLY I CRIED AS I GATHERED MYSELF TOGETHER THEN AND THERE WE SHOULD HAVE TRIED THE THING OUT
CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE THE REIGN OF QUEEN WILHELMINA
AND THAT INFERNAL CHAIR RADIATED ITS LEGS ALL ROUND US THE WATCHFUL AUSTIN HAD THROWN OPEN THE HALL DOOR WE WENT WITH A BACK SOMERSAULT DOWN THE FRONT STEPS
HE TOOK MY LETTER FROM HIS DESK AND LAID IT OUT BEFORE HIM OH YOU ARE THE YOUNG PERSON WHO CANNOT UNDERSTAND PLAIN ENGLISH ARE YOU MY GENERAL CONCLUSIONS YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO APPROVE AS I UNDERSTAND ENTIRELY SIR ENTIRELY
THERE WAS A BRUTAL DIRECTNESS ABOUT HIS METHODS WHICH MADE EVASION DIFFICULT
HE SAT IN A ROTATING CHAIR BEHIND A BROAD TABLE WHICH WAS COVERED WITH BOOKS MAPS AND DIAGRAMS AS I ENTERED HIS SEAT SPUN ROUND TO FACE ME HIS APPEARANCE MADE ME GASP
WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE I DON'T THINK MY IDEAL WOULD SPEAK LIKE THAT SAID SHE HE WOULD BE A HARDER STERNER MAN NOT SO READY TO ADAPT HIMSELF TO A SILLY GIRL'S WHIM BUT ABOVE ALL
WHICH WAS REJECTED BY THE FIRST CHAMBER A DISSOLUTION OF THIS CHAMBER LED TO THE MAJORITY BEING REVERSED AND THE MEASURE WAS PASSED ANOTHER MEASURE REVISED THE MACKAY LAW AND CONFERRED A LARGER SUBSIDY ON PRIVATE SCHOOLS
HE WON A CONCLUSIVE VICTORY AT THE POLLS THIS VICTORY WAS OBTAINED BY WHOLESALE PROMISES OF SOCIAL REFORMS INCLUDING OLD AGE PENSIONS AND POOR AND SICK RELIEF AS SO OFTEN HAPPENS SUCH A PROGRAMME COULD NOT BE CARRIED INTO EFFECT
I RELENTED NO SAID I I DO NOT WHAT'S THAT SAID THE POLICEMAN I WAS TO BLAME MYSELF I INTRUDED UPON HIM HE GAVE ME FAIR WARNING THE POLICEMAN SNAPPED UP HIS NOTEBOOK
FINDING IT JUST WHAT SHE WANTED TO HELP OUT HER BREAKFAST THEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND HAVING HELPED HERSELF AND TOTO TO A GOOD DRINK OF THE COOL CLEAR WATER SHE SET ABOUT MAKING READY FOR THE JOURNEY TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS
THE WITCH OF THE NORTH SEEMED TO THINK FOR A TIME WITH HER HEAD BOWED AND HER EYES UPON THE GROUND THEN SHE LOOKED UP AND SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHERE KANSAS IS FOR I HAVE NEVER HEARD THAT COUNTRY MENTIONED BEFORE BUT TELL ME
MY BODY SHONE SO BRIGHTLY IN THE SUN THAT I FELT VERY PROUD OF IT
WHILE I WAS IN LOVE I WAS THE HAPPIEST MAN ON EARTH BUT NO ONE CAN LOVE WHO HAS NOT A HEART AND SO I AM RESOLVED TO ASK OZ TO GIVE ME ONE IF HE DOES I WILL GO BACK TO THE MUNCHKIN MAIDEN AND MARRY HER
THEY WALKED BACK TO THE ROAD DOROTHY HELPED HIM OVER THE FENCE AND THEY STARTED ALONG THE PATH OF YELLOW BRICK FOR THE EMERALD CITY TOTO DID NOT LIKE THIS ADDITION TO THE PARTY AT FIRST HE SMELLED AROUND THE STUFFED MAN AS IF HE SUSPECTED THERE MIGHT BE A NEST OF RATS IN THE STRAW
WON'T YOU GO WITH ME PLEADED THE GIRL WHO HAD BEGUN TO LOOK UPON THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN AS HER ONLY FRIEND NO I CANNOT DO THAT SHE REPLIED BUT I WILL GIVE YOU MY KISS AND NO ONE WILL DARE INJURE A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN KISSED BY THE WITCH OF THE NORTH
THE WITCH GAVE DOROTHY A FRIENDLY LITTLE NOD WHIRLED AROUND ON HER LEFT HEEL THREE TIMES AND STRAIGHTWAY DISAPPEARED MUCH TO THE SURPRISE OF LITTLE TOTO WHO BARKED AFTER HER LOUDLY ENOUGH WHEN SHE HAD GONE
SHE REACHED DOWN AND PICKED UP THE SHOES AND AFTER SHAKING THE DUST OUT OF THEM HANDED THEM TO DOROTHY THE WITCH OF THE EAST WAS PROUD OF THOSE SILVER SHOES SAID ONE OF THE MUNCHKINS AND THERE IS SOME CHARM CONNECTED WITH THEM BUT WHAT IT IS WE NEVER KNEW
THE YEAR I STOOD THERE I HAD TIME TO THINK THAT THE GREATEST LOSS I HAD KNOWN
SHE ATE A HEARTY BREAKFAST AND WATCHED A WEE MUNCHKIN BABY WHO PLAYED WITH TOTO AND PULLED HIS TAIL AND CROWED AND LAUGHED IN A WAY THAT GREATLY AMUSED DOROTHY TOTO WAS A FINE CURIOSITY TO ALL THE PEOPLE FOR THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A DOG BEFORE
AND HE THANKED THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR HIS RELEASE FOR HE SEEMED A VERY POLITE CREATURE AND VERY GRATEFUL I MIGHT HAVE STOOD THERE ALWAYS IF YOU HAD NOT COME ALONG HE SAID SO YOU HAVE CERTAINLY SAVED MY LIFE
SAID THE GIRL WHO WAS HALF FRIGHTENED AT FACING A REAL WITCH OH NO THAT IS A GREAT MISTAKE THERE WERE ONLY FOUR WITCHES IN ALL THE LAND OF OZ AND TWO OF THEM
DOROTHY HAD ONLY ONE OTHER DRESS BUT THAT HAPPENED TO BE CLEAN AND WAS HANGING ON A PEG BESIDE HER BED IT WAS GINGHAM WITH CHECKS OF WHITE AND BLUE AND ALTHOUGH THE BLUE WAS SOMEWHAT FADED WITH MANY WASHINGS IT WAS STILL A PRETTY FROCK
WHAT WORRIED HER MOST WAS THAT THE BREAD WAS NEARLY GONE AND ANOTHER MEAL FOR HERSELF AND TOTO WOULD EMPTY THE BASKET TO BE SURE NEITHER THE WOODMAN NOR THE SCARECROW EVER ATE ANYTHING
DON'T YOU KNOW SHE RETURNED IN SURPRISE NO INDEED I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING YOU SEE I AM STUFFED SO I HAVE NO BRAINS AT ALL HE ANSWERED SADLY OH SAID DOROTHY I'M AWFULLY SORRY FOR YOU
SHE WAS THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST AS I SAID ANSWERED THE LITTLE WOMAN SHE HAS HELD ALL THE MUNCHKINS IN BONDAGE FOR MANY YEARS MAKING THEM SLAVE FOR HER NIGHT AND DAY NOW THEY ARE ALL SET FREE
BUT THE GIRL LIVED WITH AN OLD WOMAN WHO DID NOT WANT HER TO MARRY ANYONE FOR SHE WAS SO LAZY SHE WISHED THE GIRL TO REMAIN WITH HER AND DO THE COOKING AND THE HOUSEWORK SO THE OLD WOMAN WENT TO THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST AND PROMISED HER TWO SHEEP AND A COW IF SHE WOULD PREVENT THE MARRIAGE
WHEN YOU GET TO OZ DO NOT BE AFRAID OF HIM BUT TELL YOUR STORY AND ASK HIM TO HELP YOU GOOD BYE MY DEAR THE THREE MUNCHKINS BOWED LOW TO HER AND WISHED HER A PLEASANT JOURNEY AFTER WHICH THEY WALKED AWAY THROUGH THE TREES
I FEEL LIKE A NEW MAN DOROTHY WAS PUZZLED AT THIS FOR IT SOUNDED QUEER TO HEAR A STUFFED MAN SPEAK AND TO SEE HIM BOW AND WALK ALONG BESIDE HER WHO ARE YOU ASKED THE SCARECROW WHEN HE HAD STRETCHED HIMSELF AND YAWNED AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING
AND WORE WELL POLISHED BOOTS WITH A DEEP ROLL OF BLUE AT THE TOPS THE MEN DOROTHY THOUGHT WERE ABOUT AS OLD AS UNCLE HENRY FOR TWO OF THEM HAD BEARDS BUT THE LITTLE WOMAN WAS DOUBTLESS MUCH OLDER HER FACE WAS COVERED WITH WRINKLES
THEREUPON THE WICKED WITCH ENCHANTED MY AXE AND WHEN I WAS CHOPPING AWAY AT MY BEST ONE DAY FOR I WAS ANXIOUS TO GET THE NEW HOUSE AND MY WIFE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE AXE SLIPPED ALL AT ONCE AND CUT OFF MY LEFT LEG
BUT PRESENTLY THE FIGURE NODDED ITS HEAD TO HER IN A FRIENDLY WAY THEN SHE CLIMBED DOWN FROM THE FENCE AND WALKED UP TO IT WHILE TOTO RAN AROUND THE POLE AND BARKED GOOD DAY SAID THE SCARECROW IN A RATHER HUSKY VOICE
THERE WAS A GREAT CORNFIELD BEYOND THE FENCE AND NOT FAR AWAY SHE SAW A SCARECROW PLACED HIGH ON A POLE TO KEEP THE BIRDS FROM THE RIPE CORN DOROTHY LEANED HER CHIN UPON HER HAND AND GAZED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE SCARECROW
OF THE POLE STUCK UP ITS BACK WHILE DOROTHY WAS LOOKING EARNESTLY INTO THE QUEER PAINTED FACE OF THE SCARECROW SHE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE ONE OF THE EYES SLOWLY WINK AT HER SHE THOUGHT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AT FIRST FOR NONE OF THE SCARECROWS IN KANSAS EVER WINK
SO SHE BRAVELY RESOLVED NOT TO TURN BACK SHE BADE HER FRIENDS GOOD BYE AND AGAIN STARTED ALONG THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK WHEN SHE HAD GONE SEVERAL MILES SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD STOP TO REST
COME ALONG TOTO SHE SAID WE WILL GO TO THE EMERALD CITY AND ASK THE GREAT OZ HOW TO GET BACK TO KANSAS AGAIN SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LOCKED IT AND PUT THE KEY CAREFULLY IN THE POCKET OF HER DRESS AND SO
THE COUNCIL WITH THE MUNCHKINS SHE WAS AWAKENED BY A SHOCK SO SUDDEN AND SEVERE THAT IF DOROTHY HAD NOT BEEN LYING ON THE SOFT BED SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HURT AS IT WAS THE JAR MADE HER CATCH HER BREATH AND WONDER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
ALTHOUGH I LIVE IN THE LAND OF THE NORTH WHEN THEY SAW THE WITCH OF THE EAST WAS DEAD THE MUNCHKINS SENT A SWIFT MESSENGER TO ME AND I CAME AT ONCE I AM THE WITCH OF THE NORTH OH GRACIOUS CRIED DOROTHY ARE YOU A REAL WITCH
SO THE TIN WOODMAN SHOULDERED HIS AXE AND THEY ALL PASSED THROUGH THE FOREST UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE ROAD THAT WAS PAVED WITH YELLOW BRICK THE TIN WOODMAN HAD ASKED DOROTHY TO PUT THE OIL CAN IN HER BASKET FOR HE SAID IF I SHOULD GET CAUGHT IN THE RAIN
BLUE IS THE COLOR OF THE MUNCHKINS AND WHITE IS THE WITCH COLOR SO WE KNOW YOU ARE A FRIENDLY WITCH DOROTHY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS
DID YOU GROAN ASKED DOROTHY YES ANSWERED THE TIN MAN I DID I'VE BEEN GROANING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
BOTH DOROTHY AND THE SCARECROW HAD BEEN GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE STORY OF THE TIN WOODMAN AND NOW THEY KNEW WHY HE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GET A NEW HEART ALL THE SAME SAID THE SCARECROW I SHALL ASK FOR BRAINS INSTEAD OF A HEART
YOU SEE THE LAND OF OZ HAS NEVER BEEN CIVILIZED FOR WE ARE CUT OFF FROM ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD THEREFORE WE STILL HAVE WITCHES AND WIZARDS AMONGST US WHO ARE THE WIZARDS ASKED DOROTHY OZ HIMSELF IS THE GREAT WIZARD
SHE WAS STARTLED TO HEAR A DEEP GROAN NEAR BY WHAT WAS THAT SHE ASKED TIMIDLY I CANNOT IMAGINE REPLIED THE SCARECROW BUT WE CAN GO AND SEE
WITH TOTO TROTTING ALONG SOBERLY BEHIND HER SHE STARTED ON HER JOURNEY THERE WERE SEVERAL ROADS NEARBY BUT IT DID NOT TAKE HER LONG TO FIND THE ONE PAVED WITH YELLOW BRICKS WITHIN A SHORT TIME SHE WAS WALKING BRISKLY TOWARD THE EMERALD CITY
AND HE OFTEN GROWLED IN AN UNFRIENDLY WAY AT THE SCARECROW DON'T MIND TOTO SAID DOROTHY TO HER NEW FRIEND HE NEVER BITES OH I'M NOT AFRAID REPLIED THE SCARECROW HE CAN'T HURT THE STRAW DO LET ME CARRY THAT BASKET FOR YOU
AUNT EM HAS TOLD ME THAT THE WITCHES WERE ALL DEAD YEARS AND YEARS AGO WHO IS AUNT EM INQUIRED THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN
THERE WAS ONLY ONE DANGER THAT MY JOINTS WOULD RUST BUT I KEPT AN OIL CAN IN MY COTTAGE AND TOOK CARE TO OIL MYSELF WHENEVER I NEEDED IT HOWEVER THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I FORGOT TO DO THIS AND BEING CAUGHT IN A RAINSTORM BEFORE I THOUGHT OF THE DANGER MY JOINTS HAD RUSTED
FIVE LITTLE FIDDLERS PLAYED AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE AND THE PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AND SINGING WHILE A BIG TABLE NEAR BY WAS LOADED WITH DELICIOUS FRUITS AND NUTS PIES AND CAKES
IT IS EXACTLY IN THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY AND IS RULED BY OZ THE GREAT WIZARD I TOLD YOU OF IS HE A GOOD MAN INQUIRED THE GIRL ANXIOUSLY HE IS A GOOD WIZARD WHETHER HE IS A MAN OR NOT I CANNOT TELL
SHE CARRIED IT DOWN TO THE LITTLE BROOK AND FILLED IT WITH CLEAR SPARKLING WATER TOTO RAN OVER TO THE TREES AND BEGAN TO BARK AT THE BIRDS SITTING THERE DOROTHY WENT TO GET HIM AND SAW SUCH DELICIOUS FRUIT HANGING FROM THE BRANCHES THAT SHE GATHERED SOME OF IT
HOW DOROTHY SAVED THE SCARECROW WHEN DOROTHY WAS LEFT ALONE SHE BEGAN TO FEEL HUNGRY SO SHE WENT TO THE CUPBOARD AND CUT HERSELF SOME BREAD WHICH SHE SPREAD WITH BUTTER SHE GAVE SOME TO TOTO AND TAKING A PAIL FROM THE SHELF
BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN AFRAID EVEN TO GROWL WHILE SHE STOOD BY BUT DOROTHY KNOWING HER TO BE A WITCH
THEY WORE ROUND HATS THAT ROSE TO A SMALL POINT A FOOT ABOVE THEIR HEADS WITH LITTLE BELLS AROUND THE BRIMS THAT TINKLED SWEETLY AS THEY MOVED THE HATS OF THE MEN WERE BLUE THE LITTLE WOMAN'S HAT WAS WHITE
I WILL ALSO GO TO THE EMERALD CITY AND ASK OZ TO HELP ME COME ALONG SAID THE SCARECROW HEARTILY AND DOROTHY ADDED THAT SHE WOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE HIS COMPANY
IS IT A CIVILIZED COUNTRY OH YES REPLIED DOROTHY THEN THAT ACCOUNTS FOR IT IN THE CIVILIZED COUNTRIES I BELIEVE THERE ARE NO WITCHES LEFT NOR WIZARDS NOR SORCERESSES NOR MAGICIANS BUT
EVIDENTLY THE MUNCHKINS WERE GOOD FARMERS AND ABLE TO RAISE LARGE CROPS ONCE IN A WHILE SHE WOULD PASS A HOUSE AND THE PEOPLE CAME OUT TO LOOK AT HER AND BOW LOW AS SHE WENT BY FOR EVERYONE KNEW SHE HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF DESTROYING THE WICKED WITCH AND SETTING THEM FREE FROM BONDAGE
YOU MUST BE A GREAT SORCERESS WHY ASKED THE GIRL
WHY I GUESS SO DOROTHY ANSWERED IT WOULD BE AS EASY AS TO GIVE THE SCARECROW BRAINS TRUE THE TIN WOODMAN RETURNED SO IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO JOIN YOUR PARTY
YES INDEED ANSWERED THE LITTLE WOMAN BUT I AM A GOOD WITCH AND THE PEOPLE LOVE ME I AM NOT AS POWERFUL AS THE WICKED WITCH WAS WHO RULED HERE OR I SHOULD HAVE SET THE PEOPLE FREE MYSELF BUT I THOUGHT ALL WITCHES WERE WICKED
FOR A FOOL WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH A HEART IF HE HAD ONE I SHALL TAKE THE HEART RETURNED THE TIN WOODMAN FOR BRAINS DO NOT MAKE ONE HAPPY AND HAPPINESS IS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD DOROTHY DID NOT SAY ANYTHING
AND TOTO LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK EYES AND WAGGED HIS TAIL TO SHOW HE KNEW WHAT SHE MEANT AT THAT MOMENT DOROTHY SAW LYING ON THE TABLE THE SILVER SHOES THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE WITCH OF THE EAST
WHERE HER LIPS TOUCHED THE GIRL THEY LEFT A ROUND SHINING MARK AS DOROTHY FOUND OUT SOON AFTER THE ROAD TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS IS PAVED WITH YELLOW BRICK SAID THE WITCH SO YOU CANNOT MISS IT
AND THE SCARECROW WANTS HIM TO PUT A FEW BRAINS INTO HIS HEAD SHE REPLIED THE TIN WOODMAN APPEARED TO THINK DEEPLY FOR A MOMENT
OH I SEE SAID THE TIN WOODMAN BUT AFTER ALL BRAINS ARE NOT THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU ANY INQUIRED THE SCARECROW NO MY HEAD IS QUITE EMPTY ANSWERED THE WOODMAN
THIS AT FIRST SEEMED A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR I KNEW A ONE LEGGED MAN COULD NOT DO VERY WELL AS A WOOD CHOPPER SO I WENT TO A TINSMITH AND HAD HIM MAKE ME A NEW LEG OUT OF TIN THE LEG WORKED VERY WELL ONCE I WAS USED TO IT
BUT I DO NOT WANT PEOPLE TO CALL ME A FOOL AND IF MY HEAD STAYS STUFFED WITH STRAW INSTEAD OF WITH BRAINS AS YOURS IS HOW AM I EVER TO KNOW ANYTHING I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL
BESIDES YOU HAVE WHITE IN YOUR FROCK AND ONLY WITCHES AND SORCERESSES WEAR WHITE MY DRESS IS BLUE AND WHITE CHECKED SAID DOROTHY SMOOTHING OUT THE WRINKLES IN IT IT IS KIND OF YOU TO WEAR THAT SAID BOQ
FOR I AM SURE THEY WILL WORRY ABOUT ME CAN YOU HELP ME FIND MY WAY THE MUNCHKINS AND THE WITCH FIRST LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND THEN AT DOROTHY AND THEN SHOOK THEIR HEADS AT THE EAST NOT FAR FROM HERE SAID ONE
BUT HE STOOD PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS AS IF HE COULD NOT STIR AT ALL DOROTHY LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT AND SO DID THE SCARECROW WHILE TOTO BARKED SHARPLY AND MADE A SNAP AT THE TIN LEGS WHICH HURT HIS TEETH
BUT THE TINSMITH HAPPENED TO COME ALONG AND HE MADE ME A NEW HEAD OUT OF TIN I THOUGHT I HAD BEATEN THE WICKED WITCH THEN AND I WORKED HARDER THAN EVER BUT I LITTLE KNEW HOW CRUEL MY ENEMY COULD BE SHE THOUGHT OF A NEW WAY TO KILL MY LOVE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL MUNCHKIN MAIDEN
GET AN OIL CAN AND OIL MY JOINTS HE ANSWERED
SAID THE LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS TRULY SORRY FOR HIM IF YOU WILL COME WITH ME I'LL ASK OZ TO DO ALL HE CAN FOR YOU THANK YOU HE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY
MADE A LOW BOW AND SAID IN A SWEET VOICE YOU ARE WELCOME MOST NOBLE SORCERESS TO THE LAND OF THE MUNCHKINS WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR HAVING KILLED THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST AND FOR SETTING OUR PEOPLE FREE FROM BONDAGE
THE LITTLE GIRL GAVE A CRY OF AMAZEMENT AND LOOKED ABOUT HER HER EYES GROWING BIGGER AND BIGGER AT THE WONDERFUL SIGHTS SHE SAW
HOW FAR IS IT TO THE EMERALD CITY THE GIRL ASKED I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED BOQ GRAVELY FOR I HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE IT IS BETTER FOR PEOPLE TO KEEP AWAY FROM OZ UNLESS THEY HAVE BUSINESS WITH HIM
I SHALL NOT MIND IT FOR I CAN'T GET TIRED I'LL TELL YOU A SECRET HE CONTINUED AS HE WALKED ALONG THERE IS ONLY ONE THING IN THE WORLD I AM AFRAID OF WHAT IS THAT ASKED DOROTHY
THEY SEEMED ABOUT AS TALL AS DOROTHY WHO WAS A WELL GROWN CHILD FOR HER AGE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SO FAR AS LOOKS GO MANY YEARS OLDER THREE WERE MEN AND ONE A WOMAN AND ALL WERE ODDLY DRESSED
BUT ONCE I HAD BRAINS AND A HEART ALSO SO HAVING TRIED THEM BOTH
WE MUST GO AND SEARCH FOR WATER SHE SAID TO HIM WHY DO YOU WANT WATER HE ASKED TO WASH MY FACE CLEAN AFTER THE DUST OF THE ROAD AND TO DRINK SO THE DRY BREAD WILL NOT STICK IN MY THROAT
THE GIRL WASHED HERSELF CAREFULLY DRESSED HERSELF IN THE CLEAN GINGHAM AND TIED HER PINK SUNBONNET ON HER HEAD SHE TOOK A LITTLE BASKET AND FILLED IT WITH BREAD FROM THE CUPBOARD LAYING A WHITE CLOTH OVER THE TOP
SHE WAS SURPRISED AS SHE WALKED ALONG TO SEE HOW PRETTY THE COUNTRY WAS ABOUT HER THERE WERE NEAT FENCES AT THE SIDES OF THE ROAD PAINTED A DAINTY BLUE COLOR AND BEYOND THEM WERE FIELDS OF GRAIN AND VEGETABLES IN ABUNDANCE
FOR I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM HOW CAN I GET THERE ASKED DOROTHY YOU MUST WALK IT IS A LONG JOURNEY THROUGH A COUNTRY THAT IS SOMETIMES PLEASANT AND SOMETIMES DARK AND TERRIBLE HOWEVER I WILL USE ALL THE MAGIC ARTS I KNOW OF TO KEEP YOU FROM HARM
IF YOU WILL PLEASE TAKE AWAY THE POLE I SHALL BE GREATLY OBLIGED TO YOU DOROTHY REACHED UP BOTH ARMS AND LIFTED THE FIGURE OFF THE POLE FOR BEING STUFFED WITH STRAW IT WAS QUITE LIGHT
THE RESCUE OF THE TIN WOODMAN WHEN DOROTHY AWOKE THE SUN WAS SHINING THROUGH THE TREES AND TOTO HAD LONG BEEN OUT CHASING BIRDS AROUND HIM AND SQUIRRELS
A LITTLE WAY OFF WAS A SMALL BROOK RUSHING AND SPARKLING ALONG BETWEEN GREEN BANKS AND MURMURING IN A VOICE VERY GRATEFUL TO A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD LIVED SO LONG ON THE DRY GRAY PRAIRIES
AND GAVE A LITTLE CRY OF FRIGHT THERE INDEED JUST UNDER THE CORNER OF THE GREAT BEAM THE HOUSE RESTED ON TWO FEET WERE STICKING OUT SHOD IN SILVER SHOES WITH POINTED TOES
MY NAME IS DOROTHY SAID THE GIRL AND I AM GOING TO THE EMERALD CITY TO ASK THE GREAT OZ TO SEND ME BACK TO KANSAS WHERE IS THE EMERALD CITY HE INQUIRED AND WHO IS OZ WHY
AND SHE WORE A WHITE GOWN THAT HUNG IN PLEATS FROM HER SHOULDERS OVER IT WERE SPRINKLED LITTLE STARS THAT GLISTENED IN THE SUN LIKE DIAMONDS THE MEN WERE DRESSED IN BLUE OF THE SAME SHADE AS THEIR HATS
BUT ALAS I HAD NOW NO HEART SO THAT I LOST ALL MY LOVE FOR THE MUNCHKIN GIRL AND DID NOT CARE WHETHER I MARRIED HER OR NOT I SUPPOSE SHE IS STILL LIVING WITH THE OLD WOMAN WAITING FOR ME TO COME AFTER HER
ONE OF THE BIG TREES HAD BEEN PARTLY CHOPPED THROUGH AND STANDING BESIDE IT WITH AN UPLIFTED AXE IN HIS HANDS WAS A MAN MADE ENTIRELY OF TIN HIS HEAD AND ARMS AND LEGS WERE JOINTED UPON HIS BODY
DOROTHY LISTENED TO THIS SPEECH WITH WONDER WHAT COULD THE LITTLE WOMAN POSSIBLY MEAN BY CALLING HER A SORCERESS AND SAYING SHE HAD KILLED THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST DOROTHY WAS AN INNOCENT HARMLESS LITTLE GIRL
DID YOU SPEAK ASKED THE GIRL IN WONDER CERTAINLY ANSWERED THE SCARECROW HOW DO YOU DO I'M PRETTY WELL THANK YOU REPLIED DOROTHY POLITELY HOW DO YOU DO I'M NOT FEELING WELL
THAT THE TRAVELERS COULD NOT PASS BUT THE TIN WOODMAN SET TO WORK WITH HIS AXE AND CHOPPED SO WELL THAT SOON HE CLEARED A PASSAGE FOR THE ENTIRE PARTY DOROTHY WAS THINKING SO EARNESTLY AS THEY WALKED ALONG
WHEN SHE HAD TIRED WATCHING THE DANCING BOQ LED HER INTO THE HOUSE WHERE HE GAVE HER A ROOM WITH A PRETTY BED IN IT THE SHEETS WERE MADE OF BLUE CLOTH AND DOROTHY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN THEM TILL MORNING WITH TOTO CURLED UP ON THE BLUE RUG BESIDE HER
HER SILVER SHOES TINKLING MERRILY ON THE HARD YELLOW ROAD BED THE SUN SHONE BRIGHT AND THE BIRDS SANG SWEETLY AND DOROTHY DID NOT FEEL NEARLY SO BAD AS YOU MIGHT THINK A LITTLE GIRL
DOROTHY SAT UP AND NOTICED THAT THE HOUSE WAS NOT MOVING NOR WAS IT DARK FOR THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE CAME IN AT THE WINDOW FLOODING THE LITTLE ROOM SHE SPRANG FROM HER BED AND WITH TOTO AT HER HEELS RAN AND OPENED THE DOOR
I WOULD NEED THE OIL CAN BADLY IT WAS A BIT OF GOOD LUCK TO HAVE THEIR NEW COMRADE JOIN THE PARTY FOR SOON AFTER THEY HAD BEGUN THEIR JOURNEY AGAIN THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THE TREES AND BRANCHES GREW SO THICK OVER THE ROAD
AND THAT COUNTRY WHERE THE WINKIES LIVE IS RULED BY THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST WHO WOULD MAKE YOU HER SLAVE IF YOU PASSED HER WAY THE NORTH IS MY HOME SAID THE OLD LADY
THE MUNCHKINS WHO HAD BEEN STANDING SILENTLY BY GAVE A LOUD SHOUT AND POINTED TO THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE WICKED WITCH HAD BEEN LYING WHAT IS IT ASKED THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN AND LOOKED AND BEGAN TO LAUGH THE FEET OF THE DEAD WITCH HAD DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY
DOROTHY ATE A HEARTY SUPPER AND WAS WAITED UPON BY THE RICH MUNCHKIN HIMSELF WHOSE NAME WAS BOQ THEN SHE SAT UPON A SETTEE AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE DANCE WHEN BOQ SAW HER SILVER SHOES HE SAID
THERE IS A GREAT DESERT AND NONE COULD LIVE TO CROSS IT IT IS THE SAME AT THE SOUTH SAID ANOTHER FOR I HAVE BEEN THERE AND SEEN IT THE SOUTH IS THE COUNTRY OF THE QUADLINGS I AM TOLD SAID THE THIRD MAN
AFTER THIS THE ENCHANTED AXE CUT OFF MY ARMS ONE AFTER THE OTHER BUT NOTHING DAUNTED I HAD THEM REPLACED WITH TIN ONES THE WICKED WITCH THEN MADE THE AXE SLIP AND CUT OFF MY HEAD AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE END OF ME
I HAVE BEEN HOLDING THAT AXE IN THE AIR EVER SINCE I RUSTED AND I'M GLAD TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN AT LAST NOW IF YOU WILL OIL THE JOINTS OF MY LEGS I SHALL BE ALL RIGHT ONCE MORE
IT MUST BE INCONVENIENT TO BE MADE OF FLESH SAID THE SCARECROW THOUGHTFULLY FOR YOU MUST SLEEP AND EAT AND DRINK HOWEVER YOU HAVE BRAINS AND IT IS WORTH A LOT OF BOTHER TO BE ABLE TO THINK PROPERLY
HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO BE HERE WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO THE EMERALD CITY TO SEE THE GREAT OZ SHE ANSWERED AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR COTTAGE TO PASS THE NIGHT WHY DO YOU WISH TO SEE OZ HE ASKED I WANT HIM TO SEND ME BACK TO KANSAS
AND INVITED HER TO SUPPER AND TO PASS THE NIGHT WITH THEM FOR THIS WAS THE HOME OF ONE OF THE RICHEST MUNCHKINS IN THE LAND AND HIS FRIENDS WERE GATHERED WITH HIM TO CELEBRATE THEIR FREEDOM FROM THE BONDAGE OF THE WICKED WITCH
AND THEN THE MAN COULD TURN IT HIMSELF
ITS HEAD WAS A SMALL SACK STUFFED WITH STRAW WITH EYES NOSE AND MOUTH PAINTED ON IT TO REPRESENT A FACE AN OLD POINTED BLUE HAT THAT HAD BELONGED TO SOME MUNCHKIN WAS PERCHED ON HIS HEAD AND THE REST OF THE FIGURE WAS A BLUE SUIT OF CLOTHES
OIL MY NECK FIRST REPLIED THE TIN WOODMAN SO SHE OILED IT
AND AT ITS EDGE IS THE SAME GREAT DESERT THAT SURROUNDS THIS LAND OF OZ I'M AFRAID MY DEAR YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH US DOROTHY BEGAN TO SOB AT THIS FOR SHE FELT LONELY AMONG ALL THESE STRANGE PEOPLE
SAID THE SCARECROW WITH A SMILE FOR IT IS VERY TEDIOUS BEING PERCHED UP HERE NIGHT AND DAY TO SCARE AWAY CROWS CAN'T YOU GET DOWN ASKED DOROTHY NO FOR THIS POLE IS STUCK UP MY BACK
AND WHY IS THAT ASKED THE SCARECROW I WILL TELL YOU MY STORY AND THEN YOU WILL KNOW SO WHILE THEY WERE WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST THE TIN WOODMAN TOLD THE FOLLOWING STORY
THREE IN A SOLEMN VOICE AT ONCE THE CAP CHANGED TO A SLATE ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN BIG WHITE CHALK MARKS LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN TOOK THE SLATE FROM HER NOSE
THE HOUSES OF THE MUNCHKINS WERE ODD LOOKING DWELLINGS FOR EACH WAS ROUND WITH A BIG DOME FOR A ROOF ALL WERE PAINTED BLUE FOR IN THIS COUNTRY OF THE EAST BLUE WAS THE FAVORITE COLOR
BUT MY ACTION ANGERED THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST FOR SHE HAD PROMISED THE OLD WOMAN I SHOULD NOT MARRY THE PRETTY MUNCHKIN GIRL WHEN I BEGAN CHOPPING AGAIN MY AXE SLIPPED AND CUT OFF MY RIGHT LEG AGAIN I WENT TO THE TINSMITH AND AGAIN HE MADE ME A LEG OUT OF TIN
SHE SAID TO TOTO THEY WOULD BE JUST THE THING TO TAKE A LONG WALK IN FOR THEY COULD NOT WEAR OUT SHE TOOK OFF HER OLD LEATHER SHOES
WHILE SHE STOOD LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS SHE NOTICED COMING TOWARD HER A GROUP OF THE QUEEREST PEOPLE SHE HAD EVER SEEN THEY WERE NOT AS BIG AS THE GROWN FOLK SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN USED TO BUT NEITHER WERE THEY VERY SMALL IN FACT
AND SHE HAD NEVER KILLED ANYTHING IN ALL HER LIFE BUT THE LITTLE WOMAN EVIDENTLY EXPECTED HER TO ANSWER SO DOROTHY SAID WITH HESITATION YOU ARE VERY KIND BUT THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE I HAVE NOT KILLED ANYTHING
OH DEAR OH DEAR CRIED DOROTHY CLASPING HER HANDS TOGETHER IN DISMAY THE HOUSE MUST HAVE FALLEN ON HER WHATEVER SHALL WE DO THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE SAID THE LITTLE WOMAN CALMLY BUT WHO WAS SHE ASKED DOROTHY
FOR SHE WAS PUZZLED TO KNOW WHICH OF HER TWO FRIENDS WAS RIGHT AND SHE DECIDED IF SHE COULD ONLY GET BACK TO KANSAS AND AUNT EM IT DID NOT MATTER SO MUCH WHETHER THE WOODMAN HAD NO BRAINS AND THE SCARECROW NO HEART
AND HAVING READ THE WORDS ON IT ASKED IS YOUR NAME DOROTHY MY DEAR YES ANSWERED THE CHILD LOOKING UP AND DRYING HER TEARS THEN YOU MUST GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS PERHAPS OZ WILL HELP YOU WHERE IS THIS CITY ASKED DOROTHY
ANSWERED THE WITCH SINKING HER VOICE TO A WHISPER HE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ALL THE REST OF US TOGETHER HE LIVES IN THE CITY OF EMERALDS DOROTHY WAS GOING TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION BUT JUST THEN
AND SHE KNEW VERY WELL SHE WAS ONLY AN ORDINARY LITTLE GIRL
AND IT WILL TAKE YOU MANY DAYS THE COUNTRY HERE IS RICH AND PLEASANT BUT YOU MUST PASS THROUGH ROUGH AND DANGEROUS PLACES BEFORE YOU REACH THE END OF YOUR JOURNEY THIS WORRIED DOROTHY A LITTLE
TOWARD EVENING WHEN DOROTHY WAS TIRED WITH HER LONG WALK AND BEGAN TO WONDER WHERE SHE SHOULD PASS THE NIGHT SHE CAME TO A HOUSE RATHER LARGER THAN THE REST ON THE GREEN LAWN BEFORE IT MANY MEN AND WOMEN WERE DANCING
AND HAD COME AND WERE OPENLY FIGHTING AGAINST HER ON THE SIDE OF THE POTIDAEANS FOR ALL THIS WAR HAD NOT YET BROKEN OUT THERE WAS STILL TRUCE FOR A WHILE FOR THIS WAS A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE ON THE PART OF CORINTH
ONCE AND FOR ALL PUT DOWN BY LACEDAEMON FOR THIS CITY THOUGH AFTER THE SETTLEMENT OF THE DORIANS ITS PRESENT INHABITANTS IT SUFFERED FROM FACTIONS FOR AN UNPARALLELED LENGTH OF TIME STILL AT A VERY EARLY PERIOD OBTAINED GOOD LAWS
DURING THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR EVEN AFTER THE VICTORY THEY OBTAINED ON THEIR ARRIVAL AND A VICTORY THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OR THE FORTIFICATIONS OF THE NAVAL CAMP COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN BUILT THERE IS NO INDICATION OF THEIR WHOLE FORCE HAVING BEEN EMPLOYED ON THE CONTRARY
NOW AGAMEMNON'S WAS A CONTINENTAL POWER AND HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OF ANY EXCEPT THE ADJACENT ISLANDS AND THESE WOULD NOT BE MANY BUT THROUGH THE POSSESSION OF A FLEET
MORE IN CONFORMITY WITH MODERN IDEAS WAS FIRST ADOPTED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS THE RICH DOING THEIR BEST TO ASSIMILATE THEIR WAY OF LIFE TO THAT OF THE COMMON PEOPLE THEY ALSO SET THE EXAMPLE OF CONTENDING NAKED
YOU CONTENTED YOURSELVES WITH SUSPECTING THE SPEAKERS OF BEING INSPIRED BY PRIVATE INTEREST AND SO INSTEAD OF CALLING THESE ALLIES TOGETHER BEFORE THE BLOW FELL YOU HAVE DELAYED TO DO SO TILL WE ARE SMARTING UNDER IT
PUBLICLY STRIPPING AND ANOINTING THEMSELVES WITH OIL IN THEIR GYMNASTIC EXERCISES FORMERLY EVEN IN THE OLYMPIC CONTESTS THE ATHLETES WHO CONTENDED WORE BELTS ACROSS THEIR MIDDLES AND IT IS BUT A FEW YEARS SINCE THAT THE PRACTICE CEASED
WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN OBSCURED BY TIME FOR INSTANCE
AND TO REFRESH THE MEMORY OF THE OLD AND ENLIGHTEN THE IGNORANCE OF THE YOUNG FROM A NOTION THAT THEIR WORDS MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF INDUCING THEM TO PREFER TRANQUILLITY TO WAR
THE BREACH OF A TREATY CANNOT BE LAID TO THE PEOPLE WHOM DESERTION COMPELS TO SEEK NEW RELATIONS BUT TO THE POWER THAT FAILS TO ASSIST ITS CONFEDERATE BUT IF YOU WILL ONLY ACT WE WILL STAND BY YOU IT WOULD BE UNNATURAL FOR US TO CHANGE
THERE WERE GREAT DROUGHTS IN SUNDRY PLACES AND CONSEQUENT FAMINES AND THAT MOST CALAMITOUS AND AWFULLY FATAL VISITATION THE PLAGUE ALL THIS CAME UPON THEM WITH THE LATE WAR WHICH WAS BEGUN BY THE ATHENIANS AND PELOPONNESIANS
WHICH ALL THE MEN AT THE OAR ARE BOWMEN NOW IT IS IMPROBABLE THAT MANY SUPERNUMERARIES SAILED IF WE EXCEPT THE KINGS AND HIGH OFFICERS ESPECIALLY AS THEY HAD TO CROSS THE OPEN SEA WITH MUNITIONS OF WAR IN SHIPS
BUT THE OLD TOWNS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT PREVALENCE OF PIRACY WERE BUILT AWAY FROM THE SEA WHETHER ON THE ISLANDS OR THE CONTINENT AND STILL REMAIN IN THEIR OLD SITES FOR THE PIRATES USED TO PLUNDER ONE ANOTHER
WERE BEFORE THE TROJAN WAR PREVENTED BY THEIR WANT OF STRENGTH AND THE ABSENCE OF MUTUAL INTERCOURSE FROM DISPLAYING ANY COLLECTIVE ACTION INDEED THEY COULD NOT UNITE FOR THIS EXPEDITION TILL THEY HAD GAINED INCREASED FAMILIARITY WITH THE SEA
VARIOUS TOO WERE THE OBSTACLES WHICH THE NATIONAL GROWTH ENCOUNTERED IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES THE POWER OF THE IONIANS WAS ADVANCING WITH RAPID STRIDES WHEN IT CAME INTO COLLISION WITH PERSIA UNDER KING CYRUS WHO AFTER HAVING DETHRONED CROESUS
THE SEVERAL TRIBES READILY ABANDONING THEIR HOMES UNDER THE PRESSURE OF SUPERIOR NUMBERS WITHOUT COMMERCE WITHOUT FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION EITHER BY LAND OR SEA CULTIVATING NO MORE OF THEIR TERRITORY THAN THE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE REQUIRED
BORN LONG AFTER THE TROJAN WAR HE NOWHERE CALLS ALL OF THEM BY THAT NAME NOR INDEED ANY OF THEM EXCEPT THE FOLLOWERS OF ACHILLES FROM PHTHIOTIS WHO WERE THE ORIGINAL HELLENES
WHEN HE SET OUT ON HIS EXPEDITION HAD COMMITTED MYCENAE AND THE GOVERNMENT AS TIME WENT ON AND EURYSTHEUS DID NOT RETURN
THE CONFIDENCE WHICH YOU FEEL IN YOUR CONSTITUTION AND SOCIAL ORDER INCLINES YOU TO RECEIVE ANY REFLECTIONS OF OURS ON OTHER POWERS WITH A CERTAIN SCEPTICISM HENCE SPRINGS YOUR MODERATION BUT HENCE ALSO THE RATHER LIMITED KNOWLEDGE WHICH YOU BETRAY
SO THAT MUCH HAD TO BE DONE AND MANY YEARS HAD TO ELAPSE BEFORE HELLAS COULD ATTAIN TO A DURABLE TRANQUILLITY UNDISTURBED BY REMOVALS AND COULD BEGIN TO SEND OUT COLONIES AS ATHENS DID TO IONIA AND MOST OF THE ISLANDS
THEY CARED LITTLE FOR SHIFTING THEIR HABITATION AND CONSEQUENTLY NEITHER BUILT LARGE CITIES NOR ATTAINED TO ANY OTHER FORM OF GREATNESS THE RICHEST SOILS WERE ALWAYS MOST SUBJECT TO THIS CHANGE OF MASTERS SUCH AS THE DISTRICT NOW CALLED THESSALY BOEOTIA
AND THUS DID HIS BEST TO PUT DOWN PIRACY IN THOSE WATERS A NECESSARY STEP TO SECURE THE REVENUES FOR HIS OWN USE
EITHER IN WAR OR IN OTHER MATTERS FOR INSTANCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE COUNTRY NOW CALLED HELLAS HAD IN ANCIENT TIMES NO SETTLED POPULATION ON THE CONTRARY MIGRATIONS WERE OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE
PARTICULARLY IF THAT POWER ASPIRES TO THE GLORY OF BEING THE LIBERATOR OF HELLAS WE ARE AT LAST ASSEMBLED IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY TO ASSEMBLE NOR EVEN NOW ARE OUR OBJECTS DEFINED
IT ALSO INVITED INVASION ACCORDINGLY ATTICA FROM THE POVERTY OF ITS SOIL ENJOYING FROM A VERY REMOTE PERIOD FREEDOM FROM FACTION NEVER CHANGED ITS INHABITANTS
THIS BELIEF WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS GROUNDS THE PREPARATIONS OF BOTH THE COMBATANTS
PELOPS ARRIVING AMONG A NEEDY POPULATION FROM ASIA WITH VAST WEALTH ACQUIRED SUCH POWER THAT STRANGER THOUGH HE WAS THE COUNTRY WAS CALLED AFTER HIM AND THIS POWER FORTUNE SAW FIT MATERIALLY TO INCREASE IN THE HANDS OF HIS DESCENDANTS
FAR FROM PERMITTING MYSELF TO DERIVE IT FROM THE FIRST SOURCE THAT CAME TO HAND I DID NOT EVEN TRUST MY OWN IMPRESSIONS BUT IT RESTS PARTLY ON WHAT I SAW MYSELF PARTLY ON WHAT OTHERS SAW FOR ME THE ACCURACY OF THE REPORT BEING ALWAYS TRIED BY THE MOST SEVERE AND DETAILED TESTS POSSIBLE
HELD THEIR ORDINARY ASSEMBLY AND INVITED THEM TO SPEAK THERE WERE MANY WHO CAME FORWARD AND MADE THEIR SEVERAL ACCUSATIONS AMONG THEM THE MEGARIANS IN A LONG LIST OF GRIEVANCES CALLED SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE FACT OF THEIR EXCLUSION FROM THE PORTS OF THE ATHENIAN EMPIRE
THE GREAT CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONAL CHARACTERS A CONTRAST OF WHICH AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE YOU HAVE LITTLE PERCEPTION HAVING NEVER YET CONSIDERED WHAT SORT OF ANTAGONISTS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER IN THE ATHENIANS HOW WIDELY
ON OTHER BUSINESS ON HEARING THE SPEECHES THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES CALLED UPON TO COME BEFORE THE LACEDAEMONIANS
IN THE LAST STATE OF PERFECTION AND HE COULD SEE THE REST OF THE HELLENIC RACE TAKING SIDES IN THE QUARREL THOSE WHO DELAYED DOING SO AT ONCE HAVING IT IN CONTEMPLATION INDEED THIS WAS THE GREATEST MOVEMENT YET KNOWN IN HISTORY
AND DEFEND YOURSELVES NOT BY DOING ANYTHING BUT BY LOOKING AS IF YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING YOU ALONE WAIT TILL THE POWER OF AN ENEMY IS BECOMING TWICE ITS ORIGINAL SIZE INSTEAD OF CRUSHING IT IN ITS INFANCY AND YET THE WORLD USED TO SAY
FOR THE TRUE AUTHOR OF THE SUBJUGATION OF A PEOPLE IS NOT SO MUCH THE IMMEDIATE AGENT
BESIDES HIS POWER SEEMED CONSIDERABLE AND HE HAD NOT NEGLECTED TO COURT THE FAVOUR OF THE POPULACE AND ASSUMED THE SCEPTRE OF MYCENAE
WE HAVE THEREFORE NO RIGHT TO BE SCEPTICAL NOR TO CONTENT OURSELVES WITH AN INSPECTION OF A TOWN TO THE EXCLUSION OF A CONSIDERATION OF ITS POWER BUT WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT THE ARMAMENT IN QUESTION SURPASSED ALL BEFORE IT
BY A SPEEDY INVASION OF ATTICA AND DO NOT SACRIFICE FRIENDS AND KINDRED TO THEIR BITTEREST ENEMIES AND DRIVE THE REST OF US IN DESPAIR TO SOME OTHER ALLIANCE SUCH A STEP WOULD NOT BE CONDEMNED EITHER BY THE GODS WHO RECEIVED OUR OATHS OR BY THE MEN WHO WITNESSED THEM
YOU STILL DELAY AND FAIL TO SEE THAT PEACE STAYS LONGEST WITH THOSE WHO ARE NOT MORE CAREFUL TO USE THEIR POWER JUSTLY THAN TO SHOW THEIR DETERMINATION NOT TO SUBMIT TO INJUSTICE ON THE CONTRARY
AND IT WAS AT A SOMEWHAT LATER STAGE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT
AGAIN THE EARLIEST SEA FIGHT IN HISTORY WAS BETWEEN THE CORINTHIANS AND CORCYRAEANS
NOT MANY YEARS AFTER THE DEPOSITION OF THE TYRANTS THE BATTLE OF MARATHON WAS FOUGHT BETWEEN THE MEDES AND THE ATHENIANS TEN YEARS AFTERWARDS THE BARBARIAN RETURNED WITH THE ARMADA FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF HELLAS
A DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE SHE MAY FEEL FROM THE IDEA THAT YOUR BLUNTNESS OF PERCEPTION PREVENTS YOUR NOTICING HER BUT IT IS NOTHING TO THE IMPULSE WHICH HER ADVANCE WILL RECEIVE FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SEE BUT DO NOT CARE TO INTERFERE
HAVE CAST THREATS ASIDE AND BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO ACTION AND WE KNOW WHAT ARE THE PATHS BY WHICH ATHENIAN AGGRESSION TRAVELS
INDEED THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY THOSE PELOPONNESIANS WHO HAVE BEEN THE RECIPIENTS OF THE MOST CREDIBLE TRADITION IS THIS
OR OF ANY VIGOROUS ACTION OF THEIR OWN BUT AT LAST A TIME CAME WHEN THE TYRANTS OF ATHENS AND THE FAR OLDER TYRANNIES OF THE REST OF HELLAS WERE
AND ENJOYED A FREEDOM FROM TYRANTS WHICH WAS UNBROKEN IT HAS POSSESSED THE SAME FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS RECKONING TO THE END OF THE LATE WAR AND HAS THUS BEEN IN A POSITION TO ARRANGE THE AFFAIRS OF THE OTHER STATES
TO THE QUESTION WHY THEY BROKE THE TREATY I ANSWER BY PLACING FIRST AN ACCOUNT OF THEIR GROUNDS OF COMPLAINT AND POINTS OF DIFFERENCE THAT NO ONE MAY EVER HAVE TO ASK THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE WHICH PLUNGED THE HELLENES INTO A WAR OF SUCH MAGNITUDE
A FASHION WHICH SPREAD TO THEIR IONIAN KINDRED AND LONG PREVAILED AMONG THE OLD MEN THERE
BUT THE SIEGE OF POTIDAEA PUT AN END TO HER INACTION SHE HAD MEN INSIDE IT BESIDES SHE FEARED FOR THE PLACE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONING THE ALLIES TO LACEDAEMON
AND CORINTHIAN AND PELOPONNESIAN CITIZENS WITHIN IT WERE BEING BESIEGED THAT OF ATHENS AGAINST THE PELOPONNESIANS THAT THEY HAD INCITED A TOWN OF HERS A MEMBER OF HER ALLIANCE AND A CONTRIBUTOR TO HER REVENUE TO REVOLT
DATING FROM THE SAME TIME PLANTED ON AN ISTHMUS CORINTH HAD FROM TIME OUT OF MIND BEEN A COMMERCIAL EMPORIUM AS FORMERLY ALMOST ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE HELLENES WITHIN AND WITHOUT PELOPONNESE WAS CARRIED ON OVERLAND
THAT IT WAS NOT A MATTER TO BE HASTILY DECIDED ON BUT ONE THAT DEMANDED FURTHER CONSIDERATION
AS HE COLONIZED MOST OF THE ISLANDS AND THUS EXPELLED THE MALEFACTORS THE COAST POPULATION NOW BEGAN TO APPLY THEMSELVES MORE CLOSELY TO THE ACQUISITION OF WEALTH AND THEIR LIFE BECAME MORE SETTLED
AND LEAD THE WHOLE NOT TO SPEAK OF THEIR NUMEROUS ALLIES WITHOUT STILL AS THE CITY IS NEITHER BUILT IN A COMPACT FORM NOR ADORNED WITH MAGNIFICENT TEMPLES AND PUBLIC EDIFICES BUT COMPOSED OF VILLAGES AFTER THE OLD FASHION OF HELLAS
FOR THEY HOPE BY THEIR ABSENCE TO EXTEND THEIR ACQUISITIONS YOU FEAR BY YOUR ADVANCE TO ENDANGER WHAT YOU HAVE LEFT BEHIND THEY ARE SWIFT TO FOLLOW UP A SUCCESS AND SLOW TO RECOIL FROM A REVERSE THEIR BODIES THEY SPEND UNGRUDGINGLY IN THEIR COUNTRY'S CAUSE
BY THIS I CONCEIVE HE MEANT TO CONVEY THE MAXIMUM AND THE MINIMUM COMPLEMENT AT ANY RATE HE DOES NOT SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF ANY OTHERS IN HIS CATALOGUE OF THE SHIPS THAT THEY WERE ALL ROWERS
BUT NO EXACT OBSERVER WOULD THEREFORE FEEL JUSTIFIED IN REJECTING THE ESTIMATE GIVEN BY THE POETS AND BY TRADITION OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ARMAMENT FOR I SUPPOSE IF LACEDAEMON WERE TO BECOME DESOLATE
THAT YOU WERE TO BE DEPENDED UPON BUT IN YOUR CASE WE FEAR IT SAID MORE THAN THE TRUTH THE MEDE WE OURSELVES KNOW HAD TIME TO COME FROM THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO PELOPONNESE
AND SO THE POWER OF THE DESCENDANTS OF PELOPS CAME TO BE GREATER THAN THAT OF THE DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS
AND THE MARKET OF ATHENS IN DEFIANCE OF THE TREATY LAST OF ALL THE CORINTHIANS CAME FORWARD AND HAVING LET THOSE WHO PRECEDED THEM INFLAME THE LACEDAEMONIANS NOW FOLLOWED WITH A SPEECH TO THIS EFFECT
TO THIS DAY AMONG SOME OF THE BARBARIANS ESPECIALLY IN ASIA WHEN PRIZES FOR BOXING AND WRESTLING ARE OFFERED BELTS ARE WORN BY THE COMBATANTS AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER POINTS IN WHICH A LIKENESS MIGHT BE SHOWN BETWEEN THE LIFE OF THE HELLENIC WORLD OF OLD AND THE BARBARIAN OF TO DAY
TO MISTRUST EVEN WHAT IS SANCTIONED BY YOUR JUDGMENT AND TO FANCY THAT FROM DANGER THERE IS NO RELEASE FURTHER THERE IS PROMPTITUDE ON THEIR SIDE AGAINST PROCRASTINATION ON YOURS THEY ARE NEVER AT HOME YOU ARE NEVER FROM IT
AND TO ADOPT AN EASIER AND MORE LUXURIOUS MODE OF LIFE INDEED IT IS ONLY LATELY THAT THEIR RICH OLD MEN LEFT OFF THE LUXURY OF WEARING UNDERGARMENTS OF LINEN AND FASTENING A KNOT OF THEIR HAIR WITH A TIE OF GOLDEN GRASSHOPPERS
HE HAS REPRESENTED IT AS CONSISTING OF TWELVE HUNDRED VESSELS THE BOEOTIAN COMPLEMENT OF EACH SHIP BEING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEN
AGAINST ATHENS YOU PREFER TO ACT ON THE DEFENSIVE INSTEAD OF ON THE OFFENSIVE
OF TIME BE CLEARLY ASCERTAINED YET THE EVIDENCES WHICH AN INQUIRY CARRIED AS FAR BACK AS WAS PRACTICABLE LEADS ME TO TRUST ALL POINT TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ON A GREAT SCALE
AND THE CORINTHIAN TERRITORY WAS THE HIGHWAY THROUGH WHICH IT TRAVELLED SHE HAD CONSEQUENTLY GREAT MONEY RESOURCES AS IS SHOWN BY THE EPITHET WEALTHY BESTOWED BY THE OLD POETS ON THE PLACE AND THIS ENABLED HER WHEN TRAFFIC BY SEA BECAME MORE COMMON
BY ONE DISTINCTIVE APPELLATION IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT THE SEVERAL HELLENIC COMMUNITIES COMPRISING NOT ONLY THOSE WHO FIRST ACQUIRED THE NAME CITY BY CITY AS THEY CAME TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BUT ALSO THOSE WHO ASSUMED IT AFTERWARDS AS THE NAME OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE
ALLIES AMONG WHOM WE HAVE NOT THE WORST TITLE TO SPEAK AS HAVING THE GREATEST COMPLAINTS TO MAKE COMPLAINTS OF ATHENIAN OUTRAGE AND LACEDAEMONIAN NEGLECT NOW IF THESE ASSAULTS ON THE RIGHTS OF HELLAS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE DARK
AND WERE INVITED AS ALLIES INTO THE OTHER CITIES THAT ONE BY ONE THEY GRADUALLY ACQUIRED FROM THE CONNECTION THE NAME OF HELLENES
MOST OF THE PELOPONNESE ARCADIA EXCEPTED AND THE MOST FERTILE PARTS OF THE REST OF HELLAS THE GOODNESS OF THE LAND FAVOURED THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS AND THUS CREATED FACTION WHICH PROVED A FERTILE SOURCE OF RUIN
THEY WOULD HAVE EASILY DEFEATED THE TROJANS IN THE FIELD SINCE THEY COULD HOLD THEIR OWN AGAINST THEM WITH THE DIVISION ON SERVICE IN SHORT IF THEY HAD STUCK TO THE SIEGE
IN THE FACE OF THIS GREAT DANGER THE COMMAND OF THE CONFEDERATE HELLENES WAS ASSUMED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS IN VIRTUE OF THEIR SUPERIOR POWER AND THE ATHENIANS HAVING MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO ABANDON THEIR CITY BROKE UP THEIR HOMES
FROM THE REST OF HELLAS TOOK REFUGE WITH THE ATHENIANS AS A SAFE RETREAT AND AT AN EARLY PERIOD BECOMING NATURALIZED SWELLED THE ALREADY LARGE POPULATION OF THE CITY TO SUCH A HEIGHT THAT ATTICA BECAME AT LAST TOO SMALL TO HOLD THEM
AND TO THE HANDS OF HIS RELATION WHO HAD LEFT HIS FATHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF CHRYSIPPUS
AS IT IS LONG SPEECHES ARE NOT NEEDED WHERE YOU SEE SERVITUDE ACCOMPLISHED FOR SOME OF US MEDITATED FOR OTHERS IN PARTICULAR FOR OUR ALLIES AND PROLONGED PREPARATIONS IN THE AGGRESSOR AGAINST THE HOUR OF WAR OR WHAT PRAY
WERE CARIANS THEY WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE FASHION OF THE ARMS BURIED WITH THEM AND BY THE METHOD OF INTERMENT WHICH WAS THE SAME AS THE CARIANS STILL FOLLOW BUT AS SOON AS MINOS HAD FORMED HIS NAVY COMMUNICATION BY SEA BECAME EASIER
BUT AS WANT OF MONEY PROVED THE WEAKNESS OF EARLIER EXPEDITIONS SO FROM THE SAME CAUSE EVEN THE ONE IN QUESTION MORE FAMOUS THAN ITS PREDECESSORS MAY BE PRONOUNCED ON THE EVIDENCE OF WHAT IT EFFECTED TO HAVE BEEN INFERIOR TO ITS RENOWN
SO LITTLE PAINS DO THE VULGAR TAKE IN THE INVESTIGATION OF TRUTH ACCEPTING READILY THE FIRST STORY THAT COMES TO HAND ON THE WHOLE HOWEVER THE CONCLUSIONS I HAVE DRAWN FROM THE PROOFS QUOTED MAY I BELIEVE SAFELY BE RELIED ON
AND THE PELOPONNESIANS TO MOST OF ITALY AND SICILY AND SOME PLACES IN THE REST OF HELLAS ALL THESE PLACES WERE FOUNDED SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE WAR WITH TROY BUT AS THE POWER OF HELLAS GREW AND THE ACQUISITION OF WEALTH BECAME MORE AN OBJECT
INDEED EXPECTATIONS FROM YOU HAVE BEFORE NOW BEEN THE RUIN OF SOME WHOSE FAITH INDUCED THEM TO OMIT PREPARATION WE HOPE THAT NONE OF YOU WILL CONSIDER THESE WORDS OF REMONSTRANCE TO BE RATHER WORDS OF HOSTILITY
THREW THEMSELVES INTO THEIR SHIPS AND BECAME A NAVAL PEOPLE THIS COALITION AFTER REPULSING THE BARBARIAN SOON AFTERWARDS SPLIT INTO TWO SECTIONS WHICH INCLUDED THE HELLENES WHO HAD REVOLTED FROM THE KING AS WELL AS THOSE WHO HAD AIDED HIM IN THE WAR
HOW ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT FROM YOURSELVES THE ATHENIANS ARE ADDICTED TO INNOVATION AND THEIR DESIGNS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SWIFTNESS ALIKE IN CONCEPTION AND EXECUTION YOU HAVE A GENIUS FOR KEEPING WHAT YOU HAVE GOT ACCOMPANIED BY A TOTAL WANT OF INVENTION
BUT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE AS WE HAVE JUST SHOWN YOUR HABITS ARE OLD FASHIONED AS COMPARED WITH THEIRS IT IS THE LAW AS IN ART SO IN POLITICS THAT IMPROVEMENTS EVER PREVAIL
YET NOT LIKING TO BE APPREHENDED AND RISK THEIR LIVES FOR NOTHING FELL UPON HIPPARCHUS NEAR THE TEMPLE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF LEOS
AGAIN WHEREVER THERE WERE TYRANTS THEIR HABIT OF PROVIDING SIMPLY FOR THEMSELVES OF LOOKING SOLELY TO THEIR PERSONAL COMFORT AND FAMILY AGGRANDIZEMENT MADE SAFETY THE GREAT AIM OF THEIR POLICY AND PREVENTED ANYTHING GREAT PROCEEDING FROM THEM
AND THAT OF THE ARCADIANS WAS FURNISHED BY HIM THIS AT LEAST IS WHAT HOMER SAYS IF HIS TESTIMONY IS DEEMED SUFFICIENT BESIDES IN HIS ACCOUNT OF THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SCEPTRE
AND HERE IS NO INCONSIDERABLE EXEMPLIFICATION OF MY ASSERTION THAT THE MIGRATIONS WERE THE CAUSE OF THERE BEING NO CORRESPONDENT GROWTH IN OTHER PARTS THE MOST POWERFUL VICTIMS OF WAR OR FACTION
EVEN AFTER THE TROJAN WAR HELLAS WAS STILL ENGAGED IN REMOVING AND SETTLING AND THUS COULD NOT ATTAIN TO THE QUIET WHICH MUST PRECEDE GROWTH THE LATE RETURN OF THE HELLENES FROM ILIUM CAUSED MANY REVOLUTIONS
IN FINE I HAVE WRITTEN MY WORK NOT AS AN ESSAY WHICH IS TO WIN THE APPLAUSE OF THE MOMENT BUT AS A POSSESSION FOR ALL TIME THE MEDIAN WAR THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF PAST TIMES YET FOUND A SPEEDY DECISION IN TWO ACTIONS BY SEA AND TWO BY LAND
THE REVENUES OF THE STATES INCREASING TYRANNIES WERE BY THEIR MEANS ESTABLISHED ALMOST EVERYWHERE THE OLD FORM OF GOVERNMENT BEING HEREDITARY MONARCHY WITH DEFINITE PREROGATIVES
TO PROCURE HER NAVY AND PUT DOWN PIRACY AND AS SHE COULD OFFER A MART FOR BOTH BRANCHES OF THE TRADE SHE ACQUIRED FOR HERSELF ALL THE POWER WHICH A LARGE REVENUE AFFORDS
AND INDEED ALL COAST POPULATIONS WHETHER SEAFARING OR NOT THE ISLANDERS TOO WERE GREAT PIRATES THESE ISLANDERS WERE CARIANS AND PHOENICIANS BY WHOM MOST OF THE ISLANDS WERE COLONIZED AS WAS PROVED BY THE FOLLOWING FACT
IT WAS QUITE AT THE END OF THIS PERIOD THAT THE WAR WITH AEGINA AND THE PROSPECT OF THE BARBARIAN INVASION ENABLED THEMISTOCLES TO PERSUADE THE ATHENIANS TO BUILD THE FLEET WITH WHICH THEY FOUGHT AT SALAMIS
WHAT ENABLED AGAMEMNON TO RAISE THE ARMAMENT WAS MORE IN MY OPINION HIS SUPERIORITY IN STRENGTH THAN THE OATHS OF TYNDAREUS WHICH BOUND THE SUITORS TO FOLLOW HIM
WHEREAS IF ATHENS WERE TO SUFFER THE SAME MISFORTUNE I SUPPOSE THAT ANY INFERENCE FROM THE APPEARANCE PRESENTED TO THE EYE
SOME EVEN BEGAN TO BUILD THEMSELVES WALLS ON THE STRENGTH OF THEIR NEWLY ACQUIRED RICHES FOR THE LOVE OF GAIN WOULD RECONCILE THE WEAKER TO THE DOMINION OF THE STRONGER AND THE POSSESSION OF CAPITAL ENABLED THE MORE POWERFUL TO REDUCE THE SMALLER TOWNS TO SUBJECTION
PISISTRATUS WAS REALLY SUPREME
AND HELLAS BEGAN TO FIT OUT FLEETS AND APPLY HERSELF MORE CLOSELY TO THE SEA IT IS SAID THAT THE CORINTHIANS WERE THE FIRST TO APPROACH THE MODERN STYLE OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE AND THAT CORINTH WAS THE FIRST PLACE IN HELLAS WHERE GALLEYS WERE BUILT
MEN REMONSTRATE WITH FRIENDS WHO ARE IN ERROR ACCUSATIONS THEY RESERVE FOR ENEMIES WHO HAVE WRONGED THEM BESIDES WE CONSIDER THAT WE HAVE AS GOOD A RIGHT AS ANY ONE TO POINT OUT A NEIGHBOUR'S FAULTS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE CONTEMPLATE
HAVING NOW GIVEN THE RESULT OF MY INQUIRIES INTO EARLY TIMES I GRANT THAT THERE WILL BE A DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING EVERY PARTICULAR DETAIL THE WAY THAT MOST MEN DEAL WITH TRADITIONS EVEN TRADITIONS OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY
IN HIS POEMS THEY ARE CALLED DANAANS ARGIVES AND ACHAEANS HE DOES NOT EVEN USE THE TERM BARBARIAN
SO MY HABIT HAS BEEN TO MAKE THE SPEAKERS SAY WHAT WAS IN MY OPINION DEMANDED OF THEM BY THE VARIOUS OCCASIONS OF COURSE ADHERING AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO THE GENERAL SENSE OF WHAT THEY REALLY SAID AND WITH REFERENCE TO THE NARRATIVE OF EVENTS
NOR INDEED OF THE UNIVERSAL PREVALENCE OF THE NAME ON THE CONTRARY BEFORE THE TIME OF HELLEN SON OF DEUCALION NO SUCH APPELLATION EXISTED BUT THE COUNTRY WENT BY THE NAMES OF THE DIFFERENT TRIBES
SHE CAME AND LOUDLY ACCUSED ATHENS OF BREACH OF THE TREATY AND AGGRESSION ON THE RIGHTS OF PELOPONNESE WITH HER THE AEGINETANS FORMALLY UNREPRESENTED FROM FEAR OF ATHENS IN SECRET PROVED NOT THE LEAST URGENT OF THE ADVOCATES FOR WAR
AND THE TEMPLES AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS WERE LEFT THAT AS TIME WENT ON THERE WOULD BE A STRONG DISPOSITION WITH POSTERITY TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT HER FAME AS A TRUE EXPONENT OF HER POWER AND YET THEY OCCUPY TWO FIFTHS OF PELOPONNESE
HERE BY THE PARTIES CONTENDING THE OLD INHABITANTS BEING SOMETIMES REMOVED TO MAKE ROOM FOR OTHERS NEVER WAS THERE SO MUCH BANISHING AND BLOOD SHEDDING NOW ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE NOW IN THE STRIFE OF FACTION
IN DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLITICS TIME AFTER TIME WAS OUR VOICE RAISED TO WARN YOU OF THE BLOWS ABOUT TO BE DEALT US BY ATHENS AND TIME AFTER TIME INSTEAD OF TAKING THE TROUBLE TO ASCERTAIN THE WORTH OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS
THE ACARNANIANS AND THAT REGION OF THE CONTINENT AND THE CUSTOM OF CARRYING ARMS IS STILL KEPT UP AMONG THESE CONTINENTALS FROM THE OLD PIRATICAL HABITS THE WHOLE OF HELLAS USED ONCE TO CARRY ARMS THEIR HABITATIONS BEING UNPROTECTED
AND THE FIRST PERSON KNOWN TO US BY TRADITION AS HAVING ESTABLISHED A NAVY IS MINOS HE MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE HELLENIC SEA AND RULED OVER THE CYCLADES INTO MOST OF WHICH
SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PRINCIPALLY COMPOSED OF THE OLD FIFTY OARS AND LONG BOATS
AND THOUGH FIXED USAGES MAY BE BEST FOR UNDISTURBED COMMUNITIES CONSTANT NECESSITIES OF ACTION MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT OF METHODS
SUCH WERE THE WORDS OF THE CORINTHIANS
THEY SEEM TO HAVE TURNED TO CULTIVATION OF THE CHERSONESE AND TO PIRACY FROM WANT OF SUPPLIES THIS WAS WHAT REALLY ENABLED THE TROJANS TO KEEP THE FIELD FOR TEN YEARS AGAINST THEM THE DISPERSION OF THE ENEMY MAKING THEM ALWAYS A MATCH FOR THE DETACHMENT LEFT BEHIND
KINGS HAVE TWO VOTES EACH THE FACT BEING THAT THEY HAVE ONLY ONE
TO COME TO THIS WAR DESPITE THE KNOWN DISPOSITION OF THE ACTORS IN A STRUGGLE TO OVERRATE ITS IMPORTANCE
OR WITH ITS OWN REVOLTED ALLIES AND CONSEQUENTLY AFFORDED THEM CONSTANT PRACTICE IN MILITARY MATTERS AND THAT EXPERIENCE WHICH IS LEARNT IN THE SCHOOL OF DANGER
AND IMPOSED INSTEAD CONTRIBUTIONS IN MONEY ON ALL EXCEPT CHIOS AND LESBOS BOTH FOUND THEIR RESOURCES FOR THIS WAR SEPARATELY TO EXCEED THE SUM OF THEIR STRENGTH WHEN THE ALLIANCE FLOURISHED INTACT
AND WHEN FORCED TO ACT YOU NEVER GO FAR ENOUGH AGAIN THEY ARE ADVENTUROUS BEYOND THEIR POWER AND DARING BEYOND THEIR JUDGMENT AND IN DANGER THEY ARE SANGUINE YOUR WONT IS TO ATTEMPT LESS THAN IS JUSTIFIED BY YOUR POWER
SUBSEQUENTLY THE IONIANS ATTAINED TO GREAT NAVAL STRENGTH IN THE REIGN OF CYRUS THE FIRST KING OF THE PERSIANS AND OF HIS SON CAMBYSES
AND EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY MANY OF HELLAS STILL FOLLOW THE OLD FASHION THE OZOLIAN
THEY WERE THE MEANS BY WHICH THE ISLANDS WERE REACHED AND REDUCED THOSE OF THE SMALLEST AREA FALLING THE EASIEST PREY WARS BY LAND THERE WERE NONE NONE AT LEAST BY WHICH POWER WAS ACQUIRED
AND WE HAVE AMEINOCLES A CORINTHIAN SHIPWRIGHT MAKING FOUR SHIPS FOR THE SAMIANS DATING FROM THE END OF THIS WAR IT IS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
THAT CARRIED AWAY BETWEEN THEM A GOLDEN BALL THEN UP LEAPT THE NORTH WIND HE WHO GUARDS THE POLE AND DREW HIS SWORD OF ICE OUT OF HIS SCABBARD OF SNOW AND SPED AWAY ALONG THE ROAD THAT LEADS ACROSS THE BLUE
THEN FROM TINTAGGON'S MARBLE FRONT THE SEA FELL BACKWARDS CRYING ON TO A BROKEN SHORE AND RIPPLE BY RIPPLE STRAGGLED BACK TO SLID SAYING TINTAGGON STANDS
BUT TO THE GODS AS THEY SAT UPON THEIR HILLTOPS A NEW CRY CAME CRYING OVER THE GREEN SPACES THAT LAY BELOW THE HILLS AND THE GODS SAID THIS IS NEITHER THE CRY OF LIFE NOR YET THE WHISPER OF DEATH
AND STREAMED AROUND HIS FLANKS AND THEN FELL AND WAS LOST TINTAGGON STILL STOOD FIRM FOR THE HONOUR AND DOMINION OF HIS LORDS THE ELDER GODS THEN SLID WENT TO TINTAGGON AND SAID LET US NOW MAKE A TRUCE
AND FELL TOWARDS THE FIELDS AND AS INZANA STOOPED TO PICK IT UP SHE SUDDENLY HEARD THE SINGING OF ALL THE BIRDS THAT WERE
AND FAR AWAY TROGOOL UPON THE UTTER RIM TURNED A PAGE THAT WAS NUMBERED SIX IN A CIPHER THAT NONE MIGHT READ AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL WENT THROUGH THE SKY TO GLEAM ON LANDS AND CITIES THERE CAME THE FOG TOWARDS IT
WHAT IS THIS NEW CRY THAT THE GODS HAVE NEVER COMMANDED YET WHICH COMES TO THE EARS OF THE GODS
AND THE EARTHQUAKE STARTED TO HIS FEET AND FLUNG THE CAVE AWAY THE CAVE WHEREIN HE SLEPT BETWEEN THE CLIFFS AND SHOOK HIMSELF AND WENT GALLOPING ABROAD AND OVERTURNED THE MOUNTAINS THAT HID THE GOLDEN BALL
YES DEAREST CHARLES WITH HER HANDS ON HIS BREAST AND THE INQUIRING AND ATTENTIVE EXPRESSION FIXED UPON HIM WE ARE RATHER THOUGHTFUL TO NIGHT FOR WE HAVE SOMETHING ON OUR MIND TO NIGHT WHAT IS IT MY LUCIE
AS TO THE GREAT SERVICE SAID CARTON
AND ON THAT MORNING THE MIGHT OF ALL FIVE OCEANS LAY DEAD AT TINTAGGON'S FEET THAT WHICH SLID HAD CONQUERED HE STILL HELD AND THERE IS NOW NO LONGER A GREAT GREEN VALLEY IN THE SOUTH
AND OFTEN THE SEA RETREATS FAR OUT ALONG THE SHORE AND OFTEN WAVE BY WAVE COMES MARCHING IN WITH THE SOUND OF THE TRAMPING OF ARMIES THAT ALL MAY STILL REMEMBER THE GREAT FIGHT THAT SURGED ABOUT TINTAGGON ONCE WHEN HE GUARDED THE GODS AND THE GREEN EARTH AGAINST SLID
IT IS A HUNDRED TO ONE IF I SHOULD AVAIL MYSELF OF IT FOUR TIMES IN A YEAR IT WOULD SATISFY ME I DARE SAY TO KNOW THAT I HAD IT WILL YOU TRY THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT I AM PLACED ON THE FOOTING I HAVE INDICATED
AND GOING ACROSS THE GREEN EARTH CAME DOWN TO AMBRADY AT THE VALLEY'S EDGE AND THERE MET THE FOREMOST OF SLID'S FIERCE ARMIES CONQUERING THE WORLD AND AGAINST HIM SLID HURLED THE FORCE OF A WHOLE BAY WHICH LASHED ITSELF HIGH OVER TINTAGGON'S KNEES
AND THE GODS ON THEIR HILL TOPS HEARD ONCE MORE THE VOICE OF SLID EXULTING OVER THEIR CLIFFS ALREADY MORE THAN HALF THE WORLD LAY SUBJECT TO SLID AND STILL HIS ARMIES ADVANCED
THEN SLID SENT SOME OF HIS SMALLER WAVES TO SEARCH OUT WHAT STOOD AGAINST HIM AND THE CLIFFS SHATTERED THEM BUT SLID WENT BACK AND GATHERED TOGETHER A HOARD OF HIS GREATEST WAVES AND HURLED THEM AGAINST THE CLIFFS AND THE CLIFFS SHATTERED THEM
AND THE COCK AND ALL HIS TRIBE CRIED OUT WE FOUND IT WE FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL AGAIN INZANA TOSSED THE BALL AFAR LAUGHING WITH JOY TO SEE IT HER HANDS STRETCHED UPWARDS HER GOLDEN HAIR AFLOAT
UNTIL HE CAME TO THE MOUNTAINS AFAR AND ALOOF THERE DID THE THUNDER PUT HIS NOSE TO THE ROCKS AND BAY ALONG THE VALLEYS AND FAST AT HIS HEELS FOLLOWED UMBORODOM AND THE NEARER THE HOUND THE THUNDER CAME TO THE GOLDEN BALL THE LOUDER DID HE BAY
A HERON HAD SEEN IT LYING IN A POND BUT A WILD DUCK IN SOME REEDS HAD SEEN IT LAST AS SHE CAME HOME ACROSS THE HILLS AND THEN IT WAS ROLLING VERY FAR AWAY AT LAST THE COCK CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD SEEN IT LYING BENEATH THE WORLD
STOOPING AS HE WALKED WITH HIS DARK BROWN CLOAK ABOUT HIM AND BEHIND HIM SLUNK THE NIGHT AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL ROLLED PAST THE FOG SUDDENLY NIGHT SNARLED AND SPRANG UPON IT AND CARRIED IT AWAY HASTILY INZANA GATHERED THE GODS AND SAID
UP THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS SHE CAST AGAIN HER GOLDEN BALL FROM THE THRESHOLD AFAR INTO THE BLUE TO GLADDEN THE WORLD AND THE SKY AND LAUGHED TO SEE IT GO
AND THEREAFTER FASHIONED FIELDS AND HOLLOWS VALLEYS AND OTHER HILLS TO LIE ABOUT THY FEET AND NOW TINTAGGON THINE ANCIENT LORDS THE GODS ARE FACING A NEW THING WHICH OVERTHROWS THE OLD GO THEREFORE THOU TINTAGGON AND STAND UP AGAINST SLID
NOR YET TO THE TALES OF TEMPLES IN LONE LANDS THAT THE EAST WIND TOLD HER WHO HAD STOOD BESIDE HER WHEN SHE FLUNG HER GOLDEN BALL BUT FROM FAR AWAY THE WEST WIND CAME WITH NEWS OF THREE GREY TRAVELLERS WRAPT ROUND WITH BATTERED CLOAKS
HOW THE DEW HAS FALLEN AND HOW THE MISTS SET IN WITH BREEZES FROM THE STREAMS BUT THE DEW WAS THE TEARS OF THE DAWNCHILD AND THE MISTS WERE HER SIGHS
AND INZANA SAW A JEWELLED CASKET INTO WHICH HER PLAYTHING FELL BUT WHEN SHE STOOPED TO PICK IT UP AGAIN SHE FOUND NO JEWELLED CASKET WITH RUBIES SILVER OR SAPPHIRES BUT ONLY WICKED MOUNTAINS DISGUISED IN SNOW THAT HAD TRAPPED HER GOLDEN BALL
CHARLES DARNAY MADE SOME MENTION OF THIS CONVERSATION IN GENERAL TERMS AND SPOKE OF SYDNEY CARTON AS A PROBLEM OF CARELESSNESS AND RECKLESSNESS HE SPOKE OF HIM IN SHORT NOT BITTERLY OR MEANING TO BEAR HARD UPON HIM BUT AS ANYBODY MIGHT WHO SAW HIM AS HE SHOWED HIMSELF
SOMETIMES IN THEIR DREAMS THE WAR SCARRED WARRIORS OF SLID STILL LIFT THEIR HEADS AND CRY THEIR BATTLE CRY THEN DO DARK CLOUDS GATHER ABOUT TINTAGGON'S SWARTHY BROW AND HE STANDS OUT MENACING SEEN AFAR BY SHIPS WHERE ONCE HE CONQUERED SLID
AND INZANA SAT AND LISTENED AND THOUGHT OF NO GOLDEN BALL NOR EVER OF CHALCEDONY AND ONYX NOR OF ALL HER FATHERS THE GODS BUT ONLY OF ALL THE BIRDS THEN IN THE WOODS AND MEADOWS WHERE THEY HAD ALL SUDDENLY SUNG THEY SUDDENLY CEASED
AND UP THE VALLEYS SHALL GO UMBORODOM
AND IN HIS MIGHTY TREASURY TURNED OVER GEMS AND PEARLS AND LORDED IT OVER THE SEA AND SHE SAID O SLID WHOSE SOUL IS IN THE SEA BRING BACK MY GOLDEN BALL AND SLID STOOD UP SWARTHY AND CLAD IN SEAWEED
AND THE PEOPLE OF SLID THE FISHES AND THE LONG EELS WENT IN AND OUT OF ARBOURS THAT ONCE WERE DEAR TO THE GODS THEN THE GODS FEARED FOR THEIR DOMINION AND TO THE INNERMOST SACRED RECESSES OF THE MOUNTAINS TO THE VERY HEART OF THE HILLS THE GODS TROOPED OFF TOGETHER
ALWAYS AND VERY LENIENT ON HIS FAULTS WHEN HE IS NOT BY I WOULD ASK YOU TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS A HEART HE VERY VERY SELDOM REVEALS AND THAT THERE ARE DEEP WOUNDS IN IT MY DEAR I HAVE SEEN IT BLEEDING IT IS A PAINFUL REFLECTION TO ME
AND WENT AWAY TO SIT AT THE FEET OF THE GODS BUT INZANA WENT AND PATTED THE EARTHQUAKE ON THE HEAD FOR SHE SAID IT WAS DARK AND LONELY IN THE SOUL OF THE EARTH THEREAFTER RETURNING STEP BY STEP CHALCEDONY ONYX CHALCEDONY ONYX
AND HALTED BEFORE SLID THEN SLID ADVANCED NO MORE AND LULLED HIS LEGIONS AND WHILE HIS WAVES WERE LOW HE SOFTLY CROONED A SONG SUCH AS ONCE LONG AGO HAD TROUBLED THE STARS AND BROUGHT DOWN TEARS OUT OF THE TWILIGHT
GENTLE THINGS EVEN MAGNANIMOUS THINGS SHE LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PURITY OF HER FAITH IN THIS LOST MAN THAT HER HUSBAND COULD HAVE LOOKED AT HER AS SHE WAS FOR HOURS AND O MY DEAREST LOVE SHE URGED
HE SUDDENLY LAUNCHED FIVE OCEANS OUT OF THE DEEP ALL TO ATTACK TINTAGGON AND THE FIVE OCEANS SPRANG UPON TINTAGGON AND PASSED ABOVE HIS HEAD ONE BY ONE THE GRIP OF THE OCEANS LOOSENED
WHEN THE WORLDS AND ALL BEGAN THE GODS WERE STERN AND OLD AND THEY SAW THE BEGINNING FROM UNDER EYEBROWS HOAR WITH YEARS ALL BUT INZANA THEIR CHILD WHO PLAYED WITH THE GOLDEN BALL INZANA WAS THE CHILD OF ALL THE GODS
AND BADE THEM MARCH AGAINST SLID AND THE CLIFFS MARCHED DOWN TILL THEY CAME AND STOOD BEFORE SLID AND LEANED THEIR HEADS FORWARD AND FROWNED AND STOOD STAUNCH TO GUARD THE LANDS OF THE GODS AGAINST THE MIGHT OF THE SEA SHUTTING SLID OFF FROM THE WORLD
I THANK YOU DARNAY I MAY USE THAT FREEDOM WITH YOUR NAME I THINK SO CARTON BY THIS TIME THEY SHOOK HANDS UPON IT AND SYDNEY TURNED AWAY
AND BEHIND SLID THERE MARCHED A MILLION WAVES ALL FOLLOWING SLID AND TRAMPING UP THE TWILIGHT AND SLID TOUCHED EARTH IN ONE OF HER GREAT GREEN VALLEYS THAT DIVIDE THE SOUTH AND HERE HE ENCAMPED FOR THE NIGHT WITH ALL HIS WAVES ABOUT HIM
BUT MISTER DARNAY OBLIVION IS NOT SO EASY TO ME AS YOU REPRESENT IT TO BE TO YOU I HAVE BY NO MEANS FORGOTTEN IT AND A LIGHT ANSWER DOES NOT HELP ME TO FORGET IT IF IT WAS A LIGHT ANSWER RETURNED DARNAY I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR IT
THE GOLDEN BALL WENT BOUNDING UP THE SKY AND THE DAWNCHILD WITH HER FLARING HAIR STOOD LAUGHING UPON THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS AND IT WAS DAY SO GLEAMING FIELDS BELOW SAW THE FIRST OF ALL THE DAYS THAT THE GODS HAVE DESTINED
AND SLID SHALL DIVE FROM THE THRESHOLD INTO THE SEA
ALL THE GODS MADE THEMSELVES STARS FOR TORCHES AND FAR AWAY THROUGH ALL THE SKY FOLLOWED THE TRACKS OF NIGHT AS FAR AS HE PROWLED ABROAD AND AT ONE TIME SLID WITH THE PLEIADES IN HIS HAND CAME NIGH TO THE GOLDEN BALL
AND THE CHILD CRIED AND THREW IT UPON THE STAIRWAY AND CHIPPED AND BROKE ITS EDGES AND ASKED FOR THE GOLDEN BALL AND LIMPANG TUNG
AS THEY FLED WITH FLAPPING CLOAKS ALL RED AND GREY AND TATTERED HE LEAPT UP WITH THE GOLDEN BALL AND GAVE IT TO THE DAWNCHILD AGAIN INZANA TOSSED THE BALL INTO THE SKY MAKING THE THIRD DAY AND UP AND UP IT WENT
TILL IT CAME TO ITS ZENITH AND DROPPED TOWARDS THE WORLD
UPON MY LIFE SAID CARTON SMILING I FIND THAT EASIER TO COMPREHEND IN MY OWN MIND THAN TO CONVEY TO YOURS HOWEVER LET ME TRY YOU REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN I WAS MORE DRUNK THAN THAN USUAL
I WILL REMEMBER IT AS LONG AS I LIVE
THE NIGHT HATH SEIZED MY GOLDEN BALL AND NO GOD ALONE CAN FIND IT NOW FOR NONE CAN SAY HOW FAR THE NIGHT MAY ROAM WHO PROWLS ALL ROUND US AND OUT BEYOND THE WORLDS AT THE ENTREATY OF THEIR DAWNCHILD
AND SEIZED IT IN HIS JAWS WHEN INZANA SAW THE ECLIPSE BEARING HER PLAYTHING AWAY SHE CRIED ALOUD TO THE THUNDER WHO BURST FROM PEGANA AND FELL HOWLING UPON THE THROAT OF THE ECLIPSE WHO DROPPED THE GOLDEN BALL AND LET IT FALL TOWARDS EARTH
AND INZANA LOOKING UP FOUND THAT HER BALL WAS LOST AND ALL ALONE IN THE STILLNESS ONE OWL LAUGHED WHEN THE GODS HEARD INZANA CRYING FOR HER BALL THEY CLUSTERED TOGETHER ON THE THRESHOLD AND PEERED INTO THE DARK BUT SAW NO GOLDEN BALL
AND SLID HIMSELF SEIZED HOLD OF HUGE ROCKS WITH HIS CLAWS AND TORE THEM DOWN AND STAMPED THEM UNDER HIS FEET AND WHEN THE TUMULT WAS OVER THE SEA HAD WON
WILL YOU PROMISE NOT TO PRESS ONE QUESTION ON ME IF I BEG YOU NOT TO ASK IT WILL I PROMISE WHAT WILL I NOT PROMISE TO MY LOVE WHAT INDEED WITH HIS HAND PUTTING ASIDE THE GOLDEN HAIR FROM THE CHEEK
AND THE GOLDEN BALL ROLLED FREE PASSING UNDER THE SHATTERED EARTH AND SO ROLLED BACK TO PEGANA AND LIMPANG TUNG CAME HOME TO THE ONYX STEP AND TOOK THE DAWNCHILD BY THE HAND AND TOLD NOT WHAT HE HAD DONE BUT SAID IT WAS THE EARTHQUAKE
AND HIS OTHER HAND AGAINST THE HEART THAT BEAT FOR HIM I THINK CHARLES POOR MISTER CARTON DESERVES MORE CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT THAN YOU EXPRESSED FOR HIM TO NIGHT INDEED MY OWN WHY SO THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE NOT TO ASK ME
AND LEANING FORWARD THEY CRIED OUT TO THE BAT AS HE PASSED UP AND DOWN BAT THAT SEEST ALL THINGS WHERE IS THE GOLDEN BALL AND THOUGH THE BAT ANSWERED NONE HEARD AND NONE OF THE WINDS HAD SEEN IT NOR ANY OF THE BIRDS
IT WAS DARK WHEN THE CHILD INZANA THE DAWN FIRST FOUND HER GOLDEN BALL THEN RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS WITH TRIPPING FEET CHALCEDONY ONYX CHALCEDONY ONYX STEP BY STEP SHE CAST HER GOLDEN BALL ACROSS THE SKY
WENT OUT TOWARDS THE WORLD TO FIND THE GOLDEN BALL BECAUSE INZANA WEPT AND INTO THE WORLD HE WENT TILL HE CAME TO THE NETHER CLIFFS THAT STAND BY THE INNER MOUNTAINS IN THE SOUL AND HEART OF THE EARTH WHERE THE EARTHQUAKE DWELLETH ALONE
AND THERE FOUND SLID WITH ALL HIS WAVES ABOUT HIM THEN FOR A SPACE SLID AND THE FOUR WINDS STRUGGLED WITH ONE ANOTHER TILL THE STRENGTH OF THE WINDS WAS GONE AND THEY LIMPED BACK TO THE GODS THEIR MASTERS AND SAID WE HAVE MET THIS NEW THING
AND THERE WERE ONLY THE EYES OF THE GODS IN THE DARKNESS PEERING FOR THE GOLDEN BALL THEN SAID THE GODS THOU HAST LOST THY GOLDEN BALL AND THEY MADE HER A MOON OF SILVER TO ROLL ABOUT THE SKY
WAS YET THE SADDEST AT THE DAWNCHILD'S GRIEF AND WHEN THE GODS SAID PLAY WITH YOUR SILVER MOON
BUT THE SONG THAT ONCE HAD TROUBLED THE STARS WENT MOANING ON AWAKING PENT DESIRES TILL FULL AT THE FEET OF THE GODS THE MELODY FELL THEN THE BLUE RIVERS THAT LAY CURLED ASLEEP OPENED THEIR GLEAMING EYES UNCURLED THEMSELVES AND SHOOK THEIR RUSHES
AND ALL THE GODS TOGETHER SEIZED THE BALL AND NIGHT TURNING SMOTE OUT THE TORCHES OF THE GODS AND THEREAFTER SLUNK AWAY AND ALL THE GODS IN TRIUMPH MARCHED UP THE GLEAMING STAIRWAY OF THE GODS
BUT TOWARDS EVENING CERTAIN MOUNTAINS AFAR AND ALOOF CONSPIRED TOGETHER TO STAND BETWEEN THE WORLD AND THE GOLDEN BALL AND TO WRAP THEIR CRAGS ABOUT IT AND TO SHUT IT FROM THE WORLD AND ALL THE WORLD WAS DARKENED WITH THEIR PLOT AND THE DAWNCHILD UP IN PEGANA CRIED FOR HER GOLDEN BALL
THEY HAD NOT BEEN AT HOME MANY HOURS WHEN HE PRESENTED HIMSELF HE WAS NOT IMPROVED IN HABITS OR IN LOOKS OR IN MANNER BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN RUGGED AIR OF FIDELITY ABOUT HIM WHICH WAS NEW TO THE OBSERVATION OF CHARLES DARNAY
IF ONE FORLORN WANDERER THEN PACING THE DARK STREETS COULD HAVE HEARD HER INNOCENT DISCLOSURE AND COULD HAVE SEEN THE DROPS OF PITY KISSED AWAY BY HER HUSBAND FROM THE SOFT BLUE EYES SO LOVING OF THAT HUSBAND HE MIGHT HAVE CRIED TO THE NIGHT
AND IN THE DARKNESS UNDERNEATH THE WORLD HE MET THE THREE GREY TRAVELLERS AND RUSHED UPON THEM AND DROVE THEM FAR BEFORE HIM SMITING THEM WITH HIS SWORD TILL THEIR GREY CLOAKS STREAMED WITH BLOOD AND OUT OF THE MIDST OF THEM
AND OVER THE BROKEN REMNANTS OF THOSE RED CLIFFS THE ARMIES OF SLID MARCHED ON AND UP THE LONG GREEN VALLEY THEN THE GODS HEARD SLID EXULTING FAR AWAY AND SINGING SONGS OF TRIUMPH OVER THEIR BATTERED CLIFFS
DON'T BE ALARMED I AM NOT GOING TO PREACH I AM NOT AT ALL ALARMED EARNESTNESS IN YOU IS ANYTHING BUT ALARMING TO ME AH SAID CARTON WITH A CARELESS WAVE OF HIS HAND AS IF HE WAVED THAT AWAY ON THE DRUNKEN OCCASION IN QUESTION
BUT HAUGHTY AND SILENT STOOD THE MOUNTAINS WHOSE PLOT HAD DARKENED THE WORLD ALL IN THE DARK AMONG THE CRAGS IN A MIGHTY CAVERN GUARDED BY TWO TWIN PEAKS AT LAST THEY FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL FOR WHICH THE DAWNCHILD WEPT
AND ALL WENT MARCHING ON TO ASSAIL THE CLIFFS OF THE GODS AND WHEREVER THE RIVERS HAD BROKEN THE RANKS OF THE CLIFFS
AND EVER THE TRAMP OF HIS ARMIES SOUNDED NEARER AND NEARER IN THE LISTENING EARS OF THE GODS THEN THE GODS CALLED TO THEIR DOWNLANDS TO SAVE THEIR WORLD FROM SLID AND THE DOWNLANDS GATHERED THEMSELVES AND MARCHED AWAY A GREAT WHITE LINE OF GLEAMING CLIFFS
THERE ON THE SAND AMONG THE BATTERED NAVIES OF THE NAUTILUS AND BROKEN WEAPONS OF THE SWORDFISH HIDDEN BY DARK WATER HE FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL AND COMING UP IN THE NIGHT ALL GREEN AND DRIPPING
FAR OUT BEYOND THE BATTERED SHORE THAT LAY AT TINTAGGON'S FEET SLID RESTED LONG AND SENT THE NAUTILUS TO DRIFT UP AND DOWN BEFORE TINTAGGON'S EYES AND HE AND HIS ARMIES SAT SINGING IDLE SONGS OF DREAMY ISLANDS FAR AWAY TO THE SOUTH
AND WHEN THE WAVES WERE SCATTERED LIKE THOSE BEFORE THEM THE FEET OF THE CLIFFS WERE NO LONGER STANDING FIRM AND THEIR FACES WERE SCARRED AND BATTERED THEN INTO EVERY CLEFT THAT STOOD IN THE ROCKS SLID SENT HIS HUGEST WAVE AND OTHERS FOLLOWED BEHIND IT
ONE OF A LARGE NUMBER AS YOU KNOW I WAS INSUFFERABLE ABOUT LIKING YOU AND NOT LIKING YOU I WISH YOU WOULD FORGET IT I FORGOT IT LONG AGO
BUT SLID ADVANCED AND LED HIS ARMIES UP THE VALLEY AND INCH BY INCH AND MILE BY MILE HE CONQUERED THE LANDS OF THE GODS THEN FROM THEIR HILLS THE GODS SENT DOWN A GREAT ARRAY OF CLIFFS AGAINST HARD RED ROCKS
ONE MORNING AS SLID SANG OF OLD OUTRAGEOUS WARS
SAID CHARLES DARNAY QUITE ASTOUNDED THAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE HIM ANY WRONG I NEVER THOUGHT THIS OF HIM MY HUSBAND IT IS SO I FEAR HE IS NOT TO BE RECLAIMED THERE IS SCARCELY A HOPE THAT ANYTHING IN HIS CHARACTER OR FORTUNES IS REPARABLE NOW
AND MIGHTILY DIVED FROM THE LAST CHALCEDONY STEP
BUT I THINK I KNOW HE DOES IF YOU KNOW IT IT IS ENOUGH WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO MY LIFE
THEN ON AN ONYX STEP INZANA SAT DOWN AND WEPT WHO COULD NO MORE BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER GOLDEN BALL AND AGAIN THE GODS WERE SORRY AND THE SOUTH WIND CAME TO TELL HER TALES OF MOST ENCHANTED ISLANDS TO WHOM SHE LISTENED NOT
THAT IT WAS MERE PROFESSIONAL CLAPTRAP I DON'T KNOW THAT I CARED WHAT BECAME OF YOU WHEN I RENDERED IT MIND I SAY WHEN I RENDERED IT I AM SPEAKING OF THE PAST YOU MAKE LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION RETURNED DARNAY BUT I WILL NOT QUARREL WITH YOUR LIGHT ANSWER
THEN UNDER THE WORLD WENT UMBORODOM WITH HIS THUNDER PANTING BEHIND HIM AND CAME IN THE DARK BEFORE THE MORNING FROM UNDERNEATH THE WORLD AND GAVE THE DAWNCHILD BACK HER GOLDEN BALL
AND THEN SHE CRIED BECAUSE THERE WAS NONE TO FIND IT FOR THE THUNDER WAS FAR AWAY CHASING THE ECLIPSE AND ALL THE GODS LAMENTED WHEN THEY SAW HER SORROW
AND BIT THE EARTH BENEATH THEM AND HURLED THEIR CRAGS ABOUT AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH ROCKS AND FALLEN HILLS AND WENT BACK RAVENING AND GROWLING INTO THE SOUL OF THE EARTH AND THERE LAY DOWN AND SLEPT AGAIN FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
AND UMBORODOM WENT BACK INTO PEGANA AND AT ITS THRESHOLD THE THUNDER WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN THE DAWNCHILD TOSSED THE GOLDEN BALL FAR UP INTO THE BLUE ACROSS THE SKY AND THE SECOND MORNING SHONE UPON THE WORLD
I REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN YOU FORCED ME TO CONFESS THAT YOU HAD BEEN DRINKING I REMEMBER IT TOO THE CURSE OF THOSE OCCASIONS IS HEAVY UPON ME FOR I ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM I HOPE IT MAY BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ONE DAY WHEN ALL DAYS ARE AT AN END FOR ME
AND WENT TO BED AT EVENING AND PUT IT BENEATH HIS PILLOW AND WENT TO SLEEP AND NO ONE WORKED IN ALL THE WORLD BECAUSE THE CHILD WAS PLAYING AND THE LIGHT OF THE GOLDEN BALL STREAMED UP FROM UNDER THE PILLOW AND OUT THROUGH THE HALF SHUT DOOR AND SHONE IN THE WESTERN SKY
ON THE FURTHEST EDGE OF THE WORLDS AND THOU AND I ARE TO BE EQUAL LORDS WHEN THE OLD GODS ARE GONE AND THE GREEN EARTH KNOWETH SLID BEHOLD ME GLEAMING AZURE AND FAIR WITH A THOUSAND SMILES AND SWAYED BY A THOUSAND MOODS AND TINTAGGON ANSWERED
AND THE GODS WERE ANGRY WITH THEIR TRAITOROUS STREAMS THEN SLID CEASED FROM SINGING THE SONG THAT LURES THE WORLD AND GATHERED UP HIS LEGIONS
THEN FAR BELOW ON THE WORLD A HUMAN CHILD CRIED OUT TO THE DAWNCHILD FOR THE GOLDEN BALL
AND THE WORDS WOULD NOT HAVE PARTED FROM HIS LIPS FOR THE FIRST TIME
YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY SO AS A FASHION OF SPEECH BUT I DON'T MEAN ANY FASHION OF SPEECH INDEED WHEN I SAY I WISH WE MIGHT BE FRIENDS I SCARCELY MEAN QUITE THAT EITHER
AND CAST THE BALL FROM THE THRESHOLD OF THE GODS TO THE LITTLE HUMAN CHILD THAT PLAYED IN THE FIELDS BELOW AND WOULD ONE DAY DIE AND THE CHILD PLAYED ALL DAY LONG WITH THE GOLDEN BALL DOWN IN THE LITTLE FIELDS WHERE THE HUMANS LIVED
GENUINE TRUTH MISTER DARNAY TRUST ME I HAVE GONE ASIDE FROM MY PURPOSE I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR BEING FRIENDS NOW YOU KNOW ME YOU KNOW I AM INCAPABLE OF ALL THE HIGHER AND BETTER FLIGHTS OF MEN IF YOU DOUBT IT ASK STRYVER AND HE'LL TELL YOU SO
BUT NEVER FIND THE BALL AND MEN NO LONGER HAVING LIGHT OF THE GOLDEN BALL SHALL PRAY TO THE GODS NO MORE WHO HAVING NO WORSHIP SHALL BE NO MORE THE GODS
AND OF THE STILL STARS WHENCE THEY HAD STOLEN FORTH
ALL IN A WORLD OF ROCKS UNDER THE RIM OF THE SKY AND SHE WANTED HER GOLDEN BALL AND COULD NOT LOVE THE DARK THEREAT UMBORODOM WHOSE HOUND WAS THE THUNDER TOOK HIS HOUND IN LEASH AND STRODE AWAY ACROSS THE SKY AFTER THE GOLDEN BALL
I HAD NO OTHER OBJECT THAN TO TURN A SLIGHT THING WHICH TO MY SURPRISE SEEMS TO TROUBLE YOU TOO MUCH ASIDE I DECLARE TO YOU ON THE FAITH OF A GENTLEMAN THAT I HAVE LONG DISMISSED IT FROM MY MIND GOOD HEAVEN WHAT WAS THERE TO DISMISS
IN THE NIGHT TIME TIP TOED INTO THE ROOM AND TOOK THE BALL GENTLY FOR HE WAS A GOD AWAY FROM UNDER THE PILLOW AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DAWNCHILD TO GLEAM ON AN ONYX STEP
AND THE LAW BEFORE THE BEGINNING AND THEREAFTER WAS THAT ALL SHOULD OBEY THE GODS YET HITHER AND THITHER WENT ALL PEGANA'S GODS TO OBEY THE DAWNCHILD BECAUSE SHE LOVED TO BE OBEYED IT WAS DARK ALL OVER THE WORLD AND EVEN IN PEGANA WHERE DWELL THE GODS
BUT ALL THAT TINTAGGON HAD GUARDED AGAINST SLID HE GAVE BACK TO THE GODS VERY CALM THE SEA LIES NOW ABOUT TINTAGGON'S FEET WHERE HE STANDS ALL BLACK AMID CRUMBLED CLIFFS OF WHITE WITH RED ROCKS PILED ABOUT HIS FEET
AND AGAIN SLID CALLED UP OUT OF HIS DEEP A MIGHTY ARRAY OF WAVES AND SENT THEM ROARING AGAINST THE GUARDIANS OF THE GODS AND THE RED ROCKS FROWNED AND SMOTE THEM AND ONCE AGAIN SLID GATHERED HIS GREATER WAVES AND HURLED THEM AGAINST THE CLIFFS
AND I WILL DECK THEE WITH ALL THE ROBES OF THE SEA AND ALL THE PLUNDER THAT I HAVE TAKEN IN RARE CITIES SHALL BE PILED BEFORE THY FEET TINTAGGON I HAVE CONQUERED ALL THE STARS MY SONG SWELLS THROUGH ALL THE SPACE BESIDES I COME VICTORIOUS FROM MAHN AND KHANAGAT
STOLE OUT OF PEGANA AND CREPT ACROSS THE SKY AND FOUND THE BIRDS OF ALL THE WORLD SITTING IN TREES AND IVY AND WHISPERING IN THE DARK HE ASKED THEM ONE BY ONE FOR NEWS OF THE GOLDEN BALL
THAT HAS COME UPON THE EARTH AND HAVE STRIVEN AGAINST ITS ARMIES BUT COULD NOT DRIVE THEM FORTH AND THE NEW THING IS BEAUTIFUL BUT VERY ANGRY AND IS CREEPING TOWARDS THE GODS
THERE WILL NO MORE COME A TIME WHEN I PLAY WITH MY BALL AGAIN FOR NOW IT IS LOST FOR EVER AND THE GODS TRIED TO COMFORT INZANA AS SHE PLAYED WITH HER SILVER MOON BUT SHE WOULD NOT HEAR THEM AND WENT IN TEARS TO SLID WHERE HE PLAYED WITH GLEAMING SAILS
HE HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS COULD DWELL IN THE THOUGHTS OF HIS FAIR YOUNG WIFE BUT WHEN HE AFTERWARDS JOINED HER IN THEIR OWN ROOMS HE FOUND HER WAITING FOR HIM WITH THE OLD PRETTY LIFTING OF THE FOREHEAD STRONGLY MARKED WE ARE THOUGHTFUL TO NIGHT SAID DARNAY DRAWING HIS ARM ABOUT HER
AND MAKING A STIR AMONG THE HILLS CREPT DOWN TO FIND THE SEA AND PASSING ACROSS THE WORLD THEY CAME AT LAST TO WHERE THE WHITE CLIFFS STOOD AND COMING BEHIND THEM SPLIT THEM HERE AND THERE AND WENT THROUGH THEIR BROKEN RANKS TO SLID AT LAST
BUT THE BLACK MOUNTAINS DISGUISED THEMSELVES WITH SNOW AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL FELL DOWN TOWARDS THEM THEY TURNED THEIR PEAKS TO RUBY CRIMSON AND THEIR LAKES TO SAPPHIRES GLEAMING AMONGST SILVER
SHALL KNOW THE NEW GOD SLID THEN SHALL MINE ARMIES STRIVE WITH THEE NO MORE AND THOU AND I SHALL BE THE EQUAL LORDS OF THE WHOLE EARTH WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS SINGING THE CHAUNT OF SLID AND THY HEAD ALONE SHALL BE LIFTED ABOVE MINE ARMIES WHEN RIVAL HILLS ARE DEAD
THAT I MIGHT BE REGARDED AS AN USELESS AND I WOULD ADD IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE RESEMBLANCE I DETECTED BETWEEN YOU AND ME AN UNORNAMENTAL PIECE OF FURNITURE TOLERATED FOR ITS OLD SERVICE AND TAKEN NO NOTICE OF I DOUBT IF I SHOULD ABUSE THE PERMISSION
UPON AN EVENING OF THE FORGOTTEN YEARS THE GODS WERE SEATED ON THE HILLS AND ALL THE LITTLE RIVERS OF THE WORLD LAY COILED AT THEIR FEET ASLEEP
HE WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING DARNAY ASIDE INTO A WINDOW AND OF SPEAKING TO HIM WHEN NO ONE OVERHEARD MISTER DARNAY SAID CARTON
CALLING THE SOUTH WIND TO THEM AND AGAIN THE GODS SHOUTED ALL TOGETHER MAKING THE CRY OF THE NORTH CALLING THE NORTH WIND TO THEM AND THUS THEY GATHERED TO THEM ALL THEIR WINDS
BUT I DO AND YOU MUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT WELL IF YOU COULD ENDURE TO HAVE SUCH A WORTHLESS FELLOW AND A FELLOW OF SUCH INDIFFERENT REPUTATION COMING AND GOING AT ODD TIMES I SHOULD ASK THAT I MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME AND GO AS A PRIVILEGED PERSON HERE
AND CAREFULLY SHE WATCHED IT AS IT FELL BUT ALAS IT FELL WITH A SPLASH INTO THE GREAT SEA AND GLEAMED AND SHIMMERED AS IT FELL TILL THE WATERS BECAME DARK ABOVE IT AND COULD BE SEEN NO MORE AND MEN ON THE WORLD SAID
WITH AN IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY THAT SEEMED ALMOST SUSPICIOUS THEN HE CONTINUED MY MULE DIED LAST WEEK A CALAMITY IN THIS LAND EQUAL TO A DEVASTATING FIRE IN TOWN
COULDN'T AFFORD BOOKS AND CLOTHES AND COULDN'T SPARE THEIR WORK THERE GO PART OF THEM TO THE FIELDS NOW THREE BIG BOYS ASTRIDE MULES AND A STRAPPING GIRL WITH BARE BROWN LEGS
HAPPY WELL YES HE LAUGHED AND FLIPPED PEBBLES AND THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS AS IT WAS HE HAD WORKED HERE TWELVE YEARS AND HAS NOTHING BUT A MORTGAGED MULE CHILDREN YES SEVEN BUT THEY HADN'T BEEN TO SCHOOL THIS YEAR
TILL THE HOT WINDS ROLLED FROM THE FETID GULF TILL THE ROSES SHIVERED AND THE STILL STERN SUN QUIVERED ITS AWFUL LIGHT OVER THE HILLS OF ATLANTA AND THEN ONE NIGHT THE LITTLE FEET PATTERED WEARILY TO THE WEE WHITE BED
A GREAT BROAD SHOULDERED HANDSOME BLACK MAN INTELLIGENT AND JOVIAL SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACRES HE OWNS AND HAS ELEVEN BLACK TENANTS A NEAT AND TIDY HOME NESTLED IN A FLOWER GARDEN AND A LITTLE STORE STANDS BESIDE IT
THE TALKATIVE LITTLE STOREKEEPER WHO IS MY DAILY COMPANION THE SILENT OLD BLACK WOMAN PATCHING PANTALOONS AND SAYING NEVER A WORD THE RAGGED PICTURE OF HELPLESS MISFORTUNE WHO CALLED IN JUST TO SEE THE PREACHER AND FINALLY THE NEAT
AYE AND FOUND IT LIGHTER TOO SOME DAY FOR SURELY SURELY THIS IS NOT THE END
AND WE PASSED ON NOW SEARS
AND THE CHILDREN HOVERED AND FLUTTERED ABOUT HIM I CAN SEE HIM NOW CHANGING LIKE THE SKY FROM SPARKLING LAUGHTER TO DARKENING FROWNS AND THEN TO WONDERING THOUGHTFULNESS AS HE WATCHED THE WORLD
ALL JOY AND LOVE WITH TEARS TO MAKE IT BRIGHTER SWEET AS A SUMMER'S DAY BESIDE THE HOUSATONIC THE WORLD LOVED HIM THE WOMEN KISSED HIS CURLS THE MEN LOOKED GRAVELY INTO HIS WONDERFUL EYES
WAS NOT THE WORLD'S ALEMBIC TIME IN HIS YOUNG HANDS AND IS NOT MY TIME WANING ARE THERE SO MANY WORKERS IN THE VINEYARD THAT THE FAIR PROMISE OF THIS LITTLE BODY
WHILE I WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY WANDERING I FLED TO MY WIFE AND CHILD REPEATING THE WHILE TO MYSELF HALF WONDERINGLY WIFE AND CHILD WIFE AND CHILD
BUT THE OWNER WILL NOT SELL OFF A FEW ACRES TWO CHILDREN A BOY AND A GIRL ARE HOEING STURDILY IN THE FIELDS ON THE FARM WHERE CORLISS WORKS HE IS SMOOTH FACED AND BROWN AND IS FENCING UP HIS PIGS
AND YONDER IN THE FIELD IS HER DARK YOUNG HUSBAND HOEING TO SUPPORT HER AT THIRTY CENTS A DAY WITHOUT BOARD ACROSS THE WAY IS GATESBY BROWN AND TALL LORD OF TWO THOUSAND ACRES SHREWDLY WON AND HELD
THE OVERSEERS ARE WHITE AND THE CABINS ARE BARE BOARD HOUSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE THE RENTS ARE HIGH AND DAY LABORERS AND CONTRACT HANDS ABOUND IT IS A KEEN HARD STRUGGLE FOR LIVING HERE
AND THERE WERE FENCES AND MEADOWS HERE AND THERE MOST OF THIS LAND WAS POOR AND BENEATH THE NOTICE OF THE SLAVE BARON BEFORE THE WAR SINCE THEN HIS POOR RELATIONS AND FOREIGN IMMIGRANTS HAVE SEIZED IT
HAD OFFERED ITSELF TO WIN A LIFE AND WON WHAT IS THIS TINY FORMLESS THING THIS NEWBORN WAIL FROM AN UNKNOWN WORLD ALL HEAD AND VOICE
INTO MY OWN BERKSHIRE HILLS THAT SIT ALL SADLY GUARDING THE GATES OF MASSACHUSETTS UP THE STAIRS I RAN TO THE WAN MOTHER AND WHIMPERING BABE TO THE SANCTUARY ON WHOSE ALTAR A LIFE AT MY BIDDING
SO HE MOVED HERE WHERE THE RENT IS HIGHER THE LAND POORER AND THE OWNER INFLEXIBLE HE RENTS A FORTY DOLLAR MULE FOR TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR POOR LAD A SLAVE AT TWENTY TWO THIS PLANTATION OWNED NOW BY A FOREIGNER
WE PASS THE MUNSON PLACE WHERE A PLUCKY WHITE WIDOW IS RENTING AND STRUGGLING AND THE ELEVEN HUNDRED ACRES OF THE SENNET PLANTATION WITH ITS NEGRO OVERSEER
ALL THAT DAY AND ALL THAT NIGHT THERE SAT AN AWFUL GLADNESS IN MY HEART NAY BLAME ME NOT IF I SEE THE WORLD THUS DARKLY THROUGH THE VEIL AND MY SOUL WHISPERS EVER TO ME SAYING NOT DEAD
THEN TOO THERE ARE FEWER SIGNS OF A ROMANTIC PAST AND MORE OF SYSTEMATIC MODERN LAND GRABBING AND MONEY GETTING WHITE PEOPLE ARE MORE IN EVIDENCE HERE
BITTERLY HE UNBOWED PRIDE OF A HUNTED RACE CLINGING WITH THAT TINY DIMPLED HAND AH WEARILY TO A HOPE NOT HOPELESS BUT UNHOPEFUL
SHOULD BIND HER OWN TO SLOTH AND MISFORTUNE AS RUTHLESSLY AS EVER ENGLAND DID THE POOR LAND GROANS WITH ITS BIRTH PAINS AND BRINGS FORTH SCARCELY A HUNDRED POUNDS OF COTTON TO THE ACRE WHERE FIFTY YEARS AGO
WE SEE ON ALL SIDES WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF DARK FOREST A LAND OF CANAAN HERE AND THERE ARE TALES OF PROJECTS FOR MONEY GETTING BORN IN THE SWIFT DAYS OF RECONSTRUCTION
THE HARDER THE SLAVES WERE DRIVEN THE MORE CARELESS AND FATAL WAS THEIR FARMING THEN CAME THE REVOLUTION OF WAR AND EMANCIPATION THE BEWILDERMENT OF RECONSTRUCTION AND NOW WHAT IS THE EGYPT OF THE CONFEDERACY
THE WHISTLE PLACE WHICH INCLUDES HIS BIT OF LAND WAS BOUGHT SOON AFTER THE WAR BY AN ENGLISH SYNDICATE THE DIXIE COTTON AND CORN COMPANY A MARVELLOUS DEAL OF STYLE THEIR FACTOR PUT ON WITH HIS SERVANTS AND COACH AND SIX SO MUCH SO
FLED FAST AND FASTER THAN BOAT AND STEAM CAR AND YET MUST EVER IMPATIENTLY AWAIT THEM AWAY FROM THE HARD VOICED CITY
AS ITS LITTLE SOUL UNFOLDED ITSELF IN TWITTER AND CRY AND HALF FORMED WORD AND AS ITS EYES CAUGHT THE GLEAM AND FLASH OF LIFE HOW BEAUTIFUL HE WAS
THROUGH THE NEWER STRENGTH OF HIS SAW THE DREAM OF MY BLACK FATHERS STAGGER A STEP ONWARD IN THE WILD PHANTASM OF THE WORLD HEARD IN HIS BABY VOICE THE VOICE OF THE PROPHET
SLEEP THEN CHILD SLEEP TILL I SLEEP AND WAKEN TO A BABY VOICE AND THE CEASELESS PATTER OF LITTLE FEET
THE SAME TALL TREES PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOWS THE SAME GREEN GRASS GLINTED IN THE SETTING SUN ONLY IN THE CHAMBER OF DEATH WRITHED THE WORLD'S MOST PITEOUS THING A CHILDLESS MOTHER
THERE ON THE EDGE OF TOWN ARE FIVE HOUSES OF PROSTITUTES TWO OF BLACKS AND THREE OF WHITES AND IN ONE OF THE HOUSES OF THE WHITES A WORTHLESS BLACK BOY WAS HARBORED TOO OPENLY TWO YEARS AGO SO HE WAS HANGED FOR RAPE
THE PLANTERS ARE IN DEBT TO THE MERCHANTS THE TENANTS OWE THE PLANTERS AND LABORERS BOW AND BEND BENEATH THE BURDEN OF IT ALL HERE AND THERE A MAN HAS RAISED HIS HEAD ABOVE THESE MURKY WATERS
WELCOME QUITE A CONTRAST TO THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF DOUGHERTY COUNTY IS THE NORTHWEST SOBERLY TIMBERED IN OAK AND PINE IT HAS NONE OF THAT HALF TROPICAL LUXURIANCE OF THE SOUTHWEST
THEIR CABINS LOOK BETTER THAN MOST AND THE FARM WITH MACHINERY AND FERTILIZERS IS MUCH MORE BUSINESS LIKE THAN ANY IN THE COUNTY ALTHOUGH THE MANAGER DRIVES HARD BARGAINS IN WAGES WHEN NOW WE TURN AND LOOK FIVE MILES ABOVE
I SHIRK NOT I LONG FOR WORK I PANT FOR A LIFE FULL OF STRIVING I AM NO COWARD TO SHRINK BEFORE THE RUGGED RUSH OF THE STORM NOR EVEN QUAIL BEFORE THE AWFUL SHADOW OF THE VEIL BUT HEARKEN O DEATH
SURELY THERE SHALL YET DAWN SOME MIGHTY MORNING TO LIFT THE VEIL AND SET THE PRISONED FREE NOT FOR ME I SHALL DIE IN MY BONDS BUT FOR FRESH YOUNG SOULS WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NIGHT
HARD TALES OF CRUELTY AND MISTREATMENT OF THE CHAINED FREEMEN ARE TOLD BUT THE COUNTY AUTHORITIES WERE DEAF UNTIL THE FREE LABOR MARKET WAS NEARLY RUINED BY WHOLESALE MIGRATION THEN THEY TOOK THE CONVICTS FROM THE PLANTATIONS
WHICH HIS FATHER HAD HARDLY CRUSHED IN HIS OWN HEART FOR WHAT FORSOOTH SHALL A NEGRO WANT WITH PRIDE AMID THE STUDIED HUMILIATIONS OF FIFTY MILLION FELLOWS WELL SPED MY BOY
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SCENES ONE CANNOT SOON FORGET A WIDE LOW LITTLE HOUSE WHOSE MOTHERLY ROOF REACHED OVER AND SHELTERED A SNUG LITTLE PORCH THERE WE SAT AFTER THE LONG HOT DRIVE DRINKING COOL WATER
AND IN HIS LITTLE WORLD WALKED SOULS ALONE UNCOLORED AND UNCLOTHED I YEA ALL MEN ARE LARGER AND PURER BY THE INFINITE BREADTH OF THAT ONE LITTLE LIFE
BUT A WHITE MAN LOANED ME ANOTHER THEN HE ADDED EYEING US
MATRONLY PREACHER'S WIFE PLUMP YELLOW AND INTELLIGENT OWN LAND SAID THE WIFE WELL ONLY THIS HOUSE THEN SHE ADDED QUIETLY WE DID BUY SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES ACROSS UP YONDER AND PAID FOR IT BUT THEY CHEATED US OUT OF IT
AND WAKEN TO THE MORNING A MORNING WHEN MEN ASK OF THE WORKMAN NOT IS HE WHITE BUT CAN HE WORK WHEN MEN ASK ARTISTS NOT ARE THEY BLACK BUT DO THEY KNOW
I SAW AS IT FELL ACROSS MY BABY THE SHADOW OF THE VEIL WITHIN THE VEIL WAS HE BORN SAID I AND THERE WITHIN SHALL HE LIVE A NEGRO AND A NEGRO'S SON
OF THE PASSING OF THE FIRST BORN
BUT WHEN THE BLACK MAN DIED LAST FALL THE MASTER'S SONS IMMEDIATELY LAID CLAIM TO THE ESTATE AND THEM WHITE FOLKS WILL GET IT TOO SAID MY YELLOW GOSSIP I TURN FROM THESE WELL TENDED ACRES WITH A COMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THE NEGRO IS RISING
AND THE TINY HANDS TREMBLED AND A WARM FLUSHED FACE TOSSED ON THE PILLOW AND WE KNEW BABY WAS SICK TEN DAYS HE LAY THERE A SWIFT WEEK
A WEAZENED SHARP FEATURED LITTLE WOMAN WHO CURTSIED QUAINTLY AS WE GREETED HER FURTHER ON LIVES JACK DELSON THE MOST PROSPEROUS NEGRO FARMER IN THE COUNTY IT IS A JOY TO MEET HIM
I SAW THE SHADOW OF THE VEIL AS IT PASSED OVER MY BABY I SAW THE COLD CITY TOWERING ABOVE THE BLOOD RED LAND I HELD MY FACE BESIDE HIS LITTLE CHEEK
THE BOLTON CONVICT FARM FORMERLY INCLUDED THE NEIGHBORING PLANTATION HERE IT WAS THAT THE CONVICTS WERE LODGED IN THE GREAT LOG PRISON STILL STANDING A DISMAL PLACE IT STILL REMAINS WITH ROWS OF UGLY HUTS
AND SEEING WITH THOSE BRIGHT WONDERING EYES THAT PEER INTO MY SOUL A LAND WHOSE FREEDOM IS TO US A MOCKERY AND WHOSE LIBERTY A LIE
MY GIRL MOTHER SHE WHOM NOW I SAW UNFOLDING LIKE THE GLORY OF THE MORNING THE TRANSFIGURED WOMAN THROUGH HER I CAME TO LOVE THE WEE THING AS IT GREW STRONG
NO VOICE BUT HERS COULD COAX HIM OFF TO DREAMLAND AND SHE AND HE TOGETHER SPOKE SOME SOFT AND UNKNOWN TONGUE AND IN IT HELD COMMUNION I TOO MUSED ABOVE HIS LITTLE WHITE BED
SHELTERED AND SECURE IT BECAME THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR FAMILIES WEALTH AND SLAVES YET EVEN THEN THE HARD RUTHLESS RAPE OF THE LAND BEGAN TO TELL THE RED CLAY SUB SOIL ALREADY HAD BEGUN TO PEER ABOVE THE LOAM
SLOW DULL AND DISCOURAGED SHUFFLES TO OUR CARRIAGE AND TALKS HOPELESSLY WHY SHOULD HE STRIVE EVERY YEAR FINDS HIM DEEPER IN DEBT HOW STRANGE THAT GEORGIA THE WORLD HERALDED REFUGE OF POOR DEBTORS
TWENTY YEARS YONDER SUNKEN CHEEKED OLD BLACK MAN HAS LABORED UNDER THAT SYSTEM AND NOW TURNED DAY LABORER IS SUPPORTING HIS WIFE AND BOARDING HIMSELF ON HIS WAGES OF A DOLLAR AND A HALF A WEEK RECEIVED ONLY PART OF THE YEAR
AND THEY NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE GUILTY BUT BECAUSE THE STATE NEEDS CRIMINALS TO EKE OUT ITS INCOME BY THEIR FORCED LABOR IMMIGRANTS ARE HEIRS OF THE SLAVE BARON IN DOUGHERTY AND AS WE RIDE WESTWARD BY WIDE STRETCHING CORNFIELDS AND STUBBY ORCHARDS OF PEACH AND PEAR
SANG THE BIT OF YELLOW PAPER THAT FLUTTERED INTO MY ROOM ONE BROWN OCTOBER MORNING THEN THE FEAR OF FATHERHOOD MINGLED WILDLY WITH THE JOY OF CREATION I WONDERED HOW IT LOOKED
AND BABY BOY WAST THOU SO JEALOUS OF ONE LITTLE COIGN OF HAPPINESS THAT THOU MUST NEEDS ENTER THERE THOU O DEATH A PERFECT LIFE WAS HIS
HE KNEW NO COLOR LINE POOR DEAR AND THE VEIL THOUGH IT SHADOWED HIM HAD NOT YET DARKENED HALF HIS SUN HE LOVED THE WHITE MATRON HE LOVED HIS BLACK NURSE
UNSHADED WITH NO CHARM OF PAST ASSOCIATION ONLY A MEMORY OF FORCED HUMAN TOIL NOW THEN AND BEFORE THE WAR THEY ARE NOT HAPPY THESE BLACK MEN WHOM WE MEET THROUGHOUT THIS REGION
WAS A PART OF THE FAMOUS BOLTON ESTATE AFTER THE WAR IT WAS FOR MANY YEARS WORKED BY GANGS OF NEGRO CONVICTS AND BLACK CONVICTS THEN WERE EVEN MORE PLENTIFUL THAN NOW IT WAS A WAY OF MAKING NEGROES WORK AND THE QUESTION OF GUILT WAS A MINOR ONE
BETTER FAR THIS NAMELESS VOID THAT STOPS MY LIFE THAN A SEA OF SORROW FOR YOU IDLE WORDS
THE SOLEMN PINES HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THIS IS THE OAKEY WOODS WITH ITS WEALTH OF HICKORIES BEECHES OAKS AND PALMETTOS BUT A PALL OF DEBT HANGS OVER THE BEAUTIFUL LAND THE MERCHANTS ARE IN DEBT TO THE WHOLESALERS
BUT NOT UNTIL ONE OF THE FAIREST REGIONS OF THE OAKEY WOODS HAD BEEN RUINED AND RAVISHED INTO A RED WASTE OUT OF WHICH ONLY A YANKEE OR AN IMMIGRANT COULD SQUEEZE MORE BLOOD FROM DEBT CURSED TENANTS NO WONDER THAT LUKE BLACK
OR THE HOMES OF THE MASTERS SONS SAD AND BITTER TALES LIE HIDDEN BACK OF THOSE WHITE DOORS TALES OF POVERTY OF STRUGGLE OF DISAPPOINTMENT A REVOLUTION SUCH AS THAT OF SIXTY THREE IS A TERRIBLE THING
IN THE NEST I HAD BUILDED IF ONE MUST HAVE GONE WHY NOT I WHY MAY I NOT REST ME FROM THIS RESTLESSNESS AND SLEEP FROM THIS WIDE WAKING
SOME MORNING THIS MAY BE LONG LONG YEARS TO COME BUT NOW THERE WAILS ON THAT DARK SHORE WITHIN THE VEIL THE SAME DEEP VOICE THOU SHALT FOREGO
COULD LIGHTLY BE TOSSED AWAY THE WRETCHED OF MY RACE THAT LINE THE ALLEYS OF THE NATION SIT FATHERLESS AND UNMOTHERED
IS NOT THIS MY LIFE HARD ENOUGH IS NOT THAT DULL LAND THAT STRETCHES ITS SNEERING WEB ABOUT ME COLD ENOUGH IS NOT ALL THE WORLD BEYOND THESE FOUR LITTLE WALLS PITILESS ENOUGH BUT THAT THOU MUST NEEDS ENTER HERE THOU O DEATH
I HANDLE IT CURIOUSLY AND WATCH PERPLEXED ITS WINKING BREATHING AND SNEEZING I DID NOT LOVE IT THEN IT SEEMED A LUDICROUS THING TO LOVE BUT HER I LOVED
IMPROVEMENT COMPANIES WINE COMPANIES MILLS AND FACTORIES MOST FAILED AND FOREIGNERS FELL HEIR IT IS A BEAUTIFUL LAND THIS DOUGHERTY WEST OF THE FLINT THE FORESTS ARE WONDERFUL
THAT THE CONCERN SOON LANDED IN INEXTRICABLE BANKRUPTCY NOBODY LIVES IN THE OLD HOUSE NOW BUT A MAN COMES EACH WINTER OUT OF THE NORTH AND COLLECTS HIS HIGH RENTS I KNOW NOT WHICH ARE THE MORE TOUCHING SUCH OLD EMPTY HOUSES
AND STILL HAVING NOTHING TO BE SURE HE HAD GIVEN FOUR CHILDREN A COMMON SCHOOL TRAINING AND PERHAPS IF THE NEW FENCE LAW HAD NOT ALLOWED UNFENCED CROPS IN WEST DOUGHERTY HE MIGHT HAVE RAISED A LITTLE STOCK AND KEPT AHEAD
WE PASSED ONE FENCED STOCK FARM WITH GRASS AND GRAZING CATTLE THAT LOOKED VERY HOME LIKE AFTER ENDLESS CORN AND COTTON HERE AND THERE ARE BLACK FREE HOLDERS THERE IS THE GAUNT DULL BLACK JACKSON WITH HIS HUNDRED ACRES
THEN THE CHARACTER OF THE FARMS BEGINS TO CHANGE
AND I FAR MORE IGNORANT AND BLIND BY THE WEB OF MINE OWN WEAVING SIT ALONE WINDING WORDS AND MUTTERING IF STILL HE BE AND HE BE THERE AND THERE BE A THERE
MADE NOTHING FOR TWO YEARS BUT I RECKON I'VE GOT A CROP NOW THE COTTON LOOKED TALL AND RICH AND WE PRAISED IT HE CURTSIED LOW AND THEN BOWED ALMOST TO THE GROUND
THERE IS LITTLE OF THE JOYOUS ABANDON AND PLAYFULNESS WHICH WE ARE WONT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE PLANTATION NEGRO AT BEST THE NATURAL GOOD NATURE IS EDGED WITH COMPLAINT OR HAS CHANGED INTO SULLENNESS AND GLOOM
BUT THE WINDOW PANES WERE GONE THE PILLARS WERE WORM EATEN AND THE MOSS GROWN ROOF WAS FALLING IN HALF CURIOUSLY I PEERED THROUGH THE UNHINGED DOOR AND SAW WHERE ON THE WALL ACROSS THE HALL
LET HIM BE HAPPY O FATE BLITHE WAS THE MORNING OF HIS BURIAL WITH BIRD AND SONG AND SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS THE TREES WHISPERED TO THE GRASS
BEFORE THE WORLD HAD DUBBED YOUR AMBITION INSOLENCE HAD HELD YOUR IDEALS UNATTAINABLE AND TAUGHT YOU TO CRINGE AND BOW
SHE WHO IN SIMPLE CLEARNESS OF VISION SEES BEYOND THE STARS SAID WHEN HE HAD FLOWN HE WILL BE HAPPY THERE HE EVER LOVED BEAUTIFUL THINGS
I REMEMBER WHEELING AROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD BESIDE A GRACEFUL BIT OF FOREST AND A SINGING BROOK A LONG LOW HOUSE FACED US WITH PORCH AND FLYING PILLARS GREAT OAKEN DOOR AND A BROAD LAWN SHINING IN THE EVENING SUN
EVEN THEN HOWEVER THE FIELDS AS WE PROCEED BEGIN TO REDDEN AND THE TREES DISAPPEAR ROWS OF OLD CABINS APPEAR FILLED WITH RENTERS AND LABORERS CHEERLESS BARE AND DIRTY FOR THE MOST PART ALTHOUGH HERE AND THERE
OUT INTO THE STARLIGHT I CREPT TO ROUSE THE GRAY PHYSICIAN THE SHADOW OF DEATH THE SHADOW OF DEATH THE HOURS TREMBLED ON THE NIGHT LISTENED
IN VAIN FOR WHERE O GOD BENEATH THY BROAD BLUE SKY SHALL MY DARK BABY REST IN PEACE WHERE REVERENCE DWELLS AND GOODNESS AND A FREEDOM THAT IS FREE
AND ALL HAVE I FOREGONE AT THAT COMMAND AND WITH SMALL COMPLAINT ALL SAVE THAT FAIR YOUNG FORM THAT LIES SO COLDLY WED WITH DEATH
FIVE MILES BELOW HERE IS A TOWN OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY ONE WHITE NEW ENGLANDER HE OWNS ALMOST A RHODE ISLAND COUNTY WITH THOUSANDS OF ACRES AND HUNDREDS OF BLACK LABORERS
HELD HIM AND GLANCED AT THE HOT RED SOIL OF GEORGIA AND THE BREATHLESS CITY OF A HUNDRED HILLS AND FELT A VAGUE UNREST WHY WAS HIS HAIR
AND THEN HIS LITTLE SOUL LEAPT LIKE A STAR THAT TRAVELS IN THE NIGHT AND LEFT A WORLD OF DARKNESS IN ITS TRAIN THE DAY CHANGED NOT
I SAYS LOOK UP IF YOU DON'T LOOK UP YOU CAN'T GET UP REMARKS JACKSON PHILOSOPHICALLY AND HE'S GOTTEN UP DARK CARTER'S NEAT BARNS WOULD DO CREDIT TO NEW ENGLAND HIS MASTER HELPED HIM TO GET A START
NO TAUNT SHALL MADDEN HIS HAPPY BOYHOOD FOOL THAT I WAS TO THINK OR WISH THAT THIS LITTLE SOUL SHOULD GROW CHOKED AND DEFORMED WITHIN THE VEIL I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT YONDER DEEP
HERE AND THERE WE MEET DISTINCT CHARACTERS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY ONE CAME OUT OF A PIECE OF NEWLY CLEARED GROUND MAKING A WIDE DETOUR TO AVOID THE SNAKES HE WAS AN OLD HOLLOW CHEEKED MAN WITH A DRAWN
THE RETURNS OF THE FARMER ARE TOO SMALL TO ALLOW MUCH FOR WAGES AND YET HE WILL NOT SELL OFF SMALL FARMS THERE IS THE NEGRO SANFORD HE HAS WORKED FOURTEEN YEARS AS OVERSEER ON THE LADSON PLACE AND
THIS WAS INDEED THE EGYPT OF THE CONFEDERACY THE RICH GRANARY WHENCE POTATOES AND CORN AND COTTON POURED OUT TO THE FAMISHED AND RAGGED CONFEDERATE TROOPS AS THEY BATTLED FOR A CAUSE LOST LONG BEFORE EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
FOR PA WILLIS WAS THE TALL AND POWERFUL BLACK MOSES WHO LED THE NEGROES FOR A GENERATION AND LED THEM WELL HE WAS A BAPTIST PREACHER AND WHEN HE DIED TWO THOUSAND BLACK PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIM TO THE GRAVE AND NOW THEY PREACH HIS FUNERAL SERMON EACH YEAR
AND FEW HAVE TIME TO TALK TIRED WITH THE LONG RIDE WE GLADLY DRIVE INTO GILLONSVILLE IT IS A SILENT CLUSTER OF FARMHOUSES STANDING ON THE CROSSROADS WITH ONE OF ITS STORES CLOSED AND THE OTHER KEPT BY A NEGRO PREACHER
THERE IS A STORE CONDUCTED BY HIS BLACK SON
FOR MONEY MONEY WHERE WAS IT TO COME FROM AND SO THE SON ROSE IN THE NIGHT AND KILLED HIS BABY AND KILLED HIS WIFE AND SHOT HIMSELF DEAD AND THE WORLD PASSED ON
HE TINGED HER EVERY DREAM AND IDEALIZED HER EVERY EFFORT NO HANDS BUT HERS MUST TOUCH AND GARNISH THOSE LITTLE LIMBS NO DRESS OR FRILL MUST TOUCH THEM THAT HAD NOT WEARIED HER FINGERS
THOU HAST FORGOTTEN O SUMMER SWALLOW BUT THE WORLD SHALL END WHEN I FORGET SWINBURNE
AS IT IS HE IS HOPELESSLY IN DEBT DISAPPOINTED AND EMBITTERED HE STOPPED US TO INQUIRE AFTER THE BLACK BOY IN ALBANY WHOM IT WAS SAID A POLICEMAN HAD SHOT AND KILLED FOR LOUD TALKING ON THE SIDEWALK
SHOWED HIM THE STAR CHILDREN AND THE TWINKLING LIGHTS AS THEY BEGAN TO FLASH AND STILLED WITH AN EVEN SONG THE UNVOICED TERROR OF MY LIFE SO STURDY AND MASTERFUL HE GREW SO FILLED WITH BUBBLING LIFE
AND THEN HE SAID SLOWLY LET A WHITE MAN TOUCH ME AND HE DIES I DON'T BOAST THIS I DON'T SAY IT AROUND LOUD OR BEFORE THE CHILDREN BUT I MEAN IT
AND HERE TOO IS THE HIGH WHITEWASHED FENCE OF THE STOCKADE AS THE COUNTY PRISON IS CALLED THE WHITE FOLKS SAY IT IS EVER FULL OF BLACK CRIMINALS THE BLACK FOLKS SAY THAT ONLY COLORED BOYS ARE SENT TO JAIL
THEY DID NOT SAY MUCH THOSE PALE FACED HURRYING MEN AND WOMEN THEY DID NOT SAY MUCH THEY ONLY GLANCED AND SAID NIGGERS
THAT WAS TO RISE WITHIN THE VEIL AND SO WE DREAMED AND LOVED AND PLANNED BY FALL AND WINTER AND THE FULL FLUSH OF THE LONG SOUTHERN SPRING
TINKLED RESPONSIVE TO A DIFFIDENT AND UNCERTAIN TOUCH ON THE WHITE WALL THE SHADOW OF AN OLD AND SHARP PROFILE WAS BENDING OVER SEVERAL SYMMETRICAL AND SHADOWY CURLS I SEZ TO MARIAR MARIAR SEZ I
IT HURTS ME IN YOU IT'S LIKE BLOOD ON THE WING OF A HUMMING BIRD I'M NOT A HUMMING BIRD I'M A HAWK A TINY LEASHED HAWK PECKED TO DEATH BY THESE LARGE WHITE FLABBY WORMY HENS BUT I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR CONFIRMING ME IN THE FAITH
EXPECTORATED CAREFULLY ON THE AXLE AND RETURNED SLOWLY AND PENSIVELY TO THE HOTEL A THIRD SPECTATOR WEARILY DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM ONE OF THE IONIC COLUMNS OF THE PORTICO AND WALKED TO THE BOX
MISSUS MC GANUM AND I HAVEN'T ANY PARTICULAR CRUSH ON EACH OTHER SHE'S SO STOLID BUT HER MOTHER MISSUS WESTLAKE NOBODY COULD BE SWEETER YES I'M SURE SHE'S VERY BLAND
AND IN THE GLOOMY ABYSS THE SWAYING STRAPS BECKONED ME LIKE GHOSTLY HANDS TO COME IN NOW AND HAVE MY SUFFERINGS OUT AT ONCE I MUST NOT OMIT TO MENTION THE OCCURRENCE OF A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH STRUCK ME AS APPALLING AND MYSTERIOUS
THE WORST IS THE COMMERCIAL HATRED THE GROCER FEELING THAT ANY MAN WHO DOESN'T DEAL WITH HIM IS ROBBING HIM WHAT HURTS ME IS THAT IT APPLIES TO LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND DECIDEDLY TO THEIR WIVES AS MUCH AS TO GROCERS THE DOCTORS YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
THE DILLONS YES REALLY QUITE A DECENT YOUNG PAIR HARVEY DILLON AND HIS WIFE HE'S A DENTIST JUST COME TO TOWN THEY LIVE IN A ROOM BEHIND HIS OFFICE SAME AS I DO HERE THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH OF ANYBODY I'VE HEARD OF THEM
PARTICULARLY IN THIS ABYSMAL VEHICLE AND HERE IT COMES I AM A MARQUIS A FRENCH MARQUIS FRENCH BECAUSE THE PEERAGE IS NOT SO WELL KNOWN
I'M NOT SURE THAT I SHALL I'M TRYING TO DEVELOP MY OWN LARGE CAPACITY FOR DULLNESS AND CONTENTMENT I'VE FAILED AT EVERY POSITIVE THING I'VE TRIED I'D BETTER SETTLE DOWN AS THEY CALL IT AND BE SATISFIED TO BE NOTHING DON'T BE CYNICAL
IT WAS OF NO USE TO RECALL THE MANY INSTANCES WHERE PRAISE TO THE FACE HAD REDOUNDED TO THE EVERLASTING HONOR OF PRAISER AND BEPRAISED OF NO USE TO DWELL SENTIMENTALLY ON MODEST GENIUS AND COURAGE LIFTED UP AND STRENGTHENED BY OPEN COMMENDATION
USUALLY YOU HAVE TO BE POLITE TO MY GARRULOUSNESS BUT NOW I'M SITTING AT YOUR FEET IT WOULD BE RATHER NICE TO HAVE YOU LITERALLY SITTING AT MY FEET BY A FIRE WOULD YOU HAVE A FIREPLACE FOR ME NATURALLY PLEASE DON'T SNUB ME NOW
THAT THEY WERE IN HOLES AND SMUDGED TO GRAYNESS THERE WERE ONLY TWO THINGS WHICH SUGGESTED GUY POLLOCK ON THE GREEN FELT OF THE TABLE DESK BETWEEN LEGAL BLANKS AND A CLOTTED INKWELL
SHE SAT STILL AND MAUNDERED I KNOW THE VILLAGE VIRUS PERHAPS IT WILL GET ME SOME DAY I'M GOING OH NO MATTER AT LEAST I AM MAKING YOU TALK
I WOULDN'T CARE WHETHER IT WAS A LABORATORY OR A CARNIVAL BUT IT'S MERELY SAFE TELL ME MISTER POLLOCK WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH GOPHER PRAIRIE IS ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH IT ISN'T THERE PERHAPS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH YOU AND ME
HE DROPPED INTO THE SHRIEKING DESK CHAIR HE LOOKED SQUARELY AT HER SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES OF THE FACT THAT HE WAS A MAN AND LONELY THEY WERE EMBARRASSED THEY ELABORATELY GLANCED AWAY AND WERE RELIEVED AS HE WENT ON
THAT'S ALL OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF A LIVING DEAD MAN EXCEPT THE DIVERTING LAST CHAPTER THE LIES ABOUT MY HAVING BEEN A TOWER OF STRENGTH AND LEGAL WISDOM WHICH SOME DAY A PREACHER WILL SPIN OVER MY LEAN DRY BODY
I THOUGHT I WAS KEEPING UP BUT I GUESS THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ALREADY I WAS READING FOUR COPIES OF CHEAP FICTION MAGAZINES TO ONE POEM I'D PUT OFF THE MINNEAPOLIS TRIPS TILL I SIMPLY HAD TO GO THERE ON A LOT OF LEGAL MATTERS
MOST TROUBLES ARE UNNECESSARY WE HAVE NATURE BEATEN WE CAN MAKE HER GROW WHEAT WE CAN KEEP WARM WHEN SHE SENDS BLIZZARDS SO WE RAISE THE DEVIL JUST FOR PLEASURE WARS POLITICS RACE HATREDS LABOR DISPUTES
SHE WONDERED IF SHE OUGHT TO BE OFFENDED BY HIS CARESS THEN SHE WONDERED IF HE LIKED HER HAT THE NEW ORIENTAL TURBAN OF ROSE AND SILVER BROCADE HE DROPPED HER HAND HIS ELBOW BRUSHED HER SHOULDER HE FLITTED OVER TO THE DESK CHAIR HIS THIN BACK STOOPED
WE CAN'T GET WHOLESOMELY DRUNK AND RELAX WE HAVE TO BE SO CORRECT ABOUT SEX MORALS AND INCONSPICUOUS CLOTHES AND DOING OUR COMMERCIAL TRICKERY ONLY IN THE TRADITIONAL WAYS THAT NONE OF US CAN LIVE UP TO IT AND WE BECOME HORRIBLY HYPOCRITICAL UNAVOIDABLY
THEN I FOUND THAT THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ABSOLUTE I DIDN'T WANT TO FACE NEW STREETS AND YOUNGER MEN REAL COMPETITION IT WAS TOO EASY TO GO ON MAKING OUT CONVEYANCES AND ARGUING DITCHING CASES SO
HE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF ME I LOOKED LONGINGLY AT THE BOX SEAT BUT HE DID NOT RESPOND TO THE APPEAL I FLUNG MY CARPETBAG INTO THE CHASM DIVED RECKLESSLY AFTER IT AND BEFORE I WAS FAIRLY SEATED
AND FOR FOUR YEARS I LIVED OH I WON'T RHAPSODIZE ABOUT NEW YORK IT WAS DIRTY AND NOISY AND BREATHLESS AND GHASTLY EXPENSIVE BUT COMPARED WITH THE MOLDY ACADEMY IN WHICH I HAD BEEN SMOTHERED I WENT TO SYMPHONIES TWICE A WEEK
RESCUED BY THE ANGEL I HAVE BEEN DREAMING OF WHO IS THE ASSUMED DAUGHTER OF THE BRIGAND BUT THE REAL DAUGHTER OF AN INTIMATE FRIEND LOOKING FROM THE WINDOW AGAIN IN THE VAIN HOPE OF DISTINGUISHING THE DRIVER
BUT ALSO IN SKATING I'LL SKATE WITH THEM OR SLIDE OR THROW SNOWBALLS JUST AS GLADLY AS TALK WITH YOU OH NO YES BUT THEY WANT TO STAY HOME AND EMBROIDER PERHAPS I'M NOT DEFENDING THE TOWN
BUT I WOULDN'T TELL HER MY HEART'S SECRETS IF I WERE YOU MY DEAR I INSIST THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE PROFESSIONAL MAN'S WIFE IN THIS TOWN WHO DOESN'T PLOT AND THAT IS YOU YOU BLESSED CREDULOUS OUTSIDER I WON'T BE CAJOLED
THEY WERE NOT AT HOME LIKE A CHILD WHO HAS NO ONE TO PLAY WITH SHE LOITERED THROUGH THE DARK HALL SHE SAW A LIGHT UNDER AN OFFICE DOOR SHE KNOCKED TO THE PERSON WHO OPENED SHE MURMURED DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE THE PERRYS ARE
MY FEARS FOR THE DRIVER WERE DISSIPATED WITH THE RISING MOON A FAMILIAR SOUND HAD ASSURED ME OF HIS PRESENCE IN THE FULL POSSESSION OF AT LEAST ONE OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS
ACROSS IT HE PEERED AT HER WITH SUCH LONELINESS THAT SHE WAS STARTLED BUT HIS EYES FADED INTO IMPERSONALITY AS HE TALKED OF THE JEALOUSIES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE HE STOPPED HIMSELF WITH A SHARP GOOD LORD CAROL YOU'RE NOT A JURY
IT IS SO DARK THAT WHEN I ALIGHT I DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE FACE OF THE FOOTMAN WHO HOLDS THE CARRIAGE DOOR BUT WHAT OF THAT PESTE I AM HEAVY WITH SLEEP THE SAME OBSCURITY ALSO HIDES THE OLD FAMILIAR INDECENCIES OF THE STATUES ON THE TERRACE
AND NONE OF THE INTRIGANTE'S JOY IN FURTIVENESS IF SHE WAS THE NAIVE GIRL GUY POLLOCK WAS THE CLUMSY BOY HE RACED ABOUT THE OFFICE HE RAMMED HIS FISTS INTO HIS POCKETS HE STAMMERED I I I OH THE DEVIL
I TRIED TO THINK THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MARIAR'S I TRIED TO IMAGINE THAT CONFINING THE SYMMETRICAL CURLS OF THAT GIRL IT MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE SOFT COMPLIMENTS WHISPERED IN HER EARS WHICH PROVOKED THE WRATH OF THE AGED FEMALE BUT IN VAIN
SHE REALIZED THAT IT WAS GUY POLLOCK I'M AWFULLY SORRY MISSUS KENNICOTT BUT I DON'T KNOW WON'T YOU COME IN AND WAIT FOR THEM
THE INCONSTANT MOON THAT THEN AND THEREAFTER REMAINS FIXED IN THE HEAVENS AS THOUGH IT WERE A PART OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM INAUGURATED BY JOSHUA AGAIN THE WHITE ROBED DRUIDS FILED PAST ME
LET THE OLD MAN RAVE HOW OLD ARE YOU CAROL TWENTY SIX GUY TWENTY SIX I WAS JUST LEAVING NEW YORK AT TWENTY SIX I HEARD PATTI SING AT TWENTY SIX AND NOW I'M FORTY SEVEN
HE STALKED TO HER TOOK HER UNRESPONSIVE HAND CAROL YOU HAVE BEEN HAPPY HERE TONIGHT YES I'M BEGGING SHE SQUEEZED HIS HAND QUICKLY THEN SNATCHED HERS AWAY SHE HAD BUT LITTLE OF THE CURIOSITY OF THE FLIRT
SHE REMEMBERED CERTAIN REMARKS WHICH KENNICOTT HAD OFFERED REGARDING THE WIDOW BOGART SHE FLINCHED LOOKED AT GUY BESEECHINGLY HE SPRANG UP STRODE TO HER WITH A NERVOUS STEP SMOOTHED HER HAND
THE INMATES OF THE EUREKA HOUSE FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE THERE WAS THE PREVAILING OPINION SO COMMON TO MANY HONEST PEOPLE THAT A SERIOUS STYLE OF DEPORTMENT AND CONDUCT TOWARD A STRANGER INDICATES HIGH GENTILITY AND ELEVATED STATION
BY DINT OF MUCH GYMNASTIC EFFORT I BECAME SUFFICIENTLY COMPOSED TO BE AWARE OF A MORE REFINED SPECIES OF TORTURE THE SPRINGS OF THE STAGE RISING AND FALLING REGULARLY PRODUCED A RHYTHMICAL BEAT WHICH BEGAN TO ABSORB MY ATTENTION PAINFULLY
CAN I HELP HOW COULD YOU I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BY LISTENING I HAVEN'T DONE THAT TONIGHT BUT NORMALLY CAN'T I BE THE CONFIDANT OF THE OLD FRENCH PLAYS THE TIRING MAID WITH THE MIRROR AND THE LOYAL EARS
AGAIN I SAW THAT IMPROBABLE MISTLETOE CUT FROM THAT IMPOSSIBLE OAK AND AGAIN COLD CHILLS RAN DOWN MY BACK WITH THE FIRST STRAIN OF THE RECITATIVE
HERE A STRANGER IS TAKEN IN IF HE IS CORRECT IF HE LIKES HUNTING AND MOTORING AND GOD AND OUR SENATOR THERE WE DIDN'T TAKE IN EVEN OUR OWN TILL WE HAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY GOT USED TO THEM
THE VILLAGE VIRUS IS THE GERM WHICH IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY LIKE THE HOOK WORM IT INFECTS AMBITIOUS PEOPLE WHO STAY TOO LONG IN THE PROVINCES YOU'LL FIND IT EPIDEMIC AMONG LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND MINISTERS AND COLLEGE BRED MERCHANTS
HOW YOUR HUSBAND AND WESTLAKE AND GOULD DISLIKE ONE ANOTHER
MAY I JOIN YOU IN THE HONOR OF HAVING SOMETHING THE MATTER YES THANKS NO I THINK IT'S THE TOWN BECAUSE THEY ENJOY SKATING MORE THAN BIOLOGY BUT I'M NOT ONLY MORE INTERESTED IN BIOLOGY THAN THE JOLLY SEVENTEEN
I WON'T BELIEVE THAT MEDICINE THE PRIESTHOOD OF HEALING CAN BE TURNED INTO A PENNY PICKING BUSINESS SEE HERE HASN'T KENNICOTT EVER HINTED TO YOU THAT YOU'D BETTER BE NICE TO SOME OLD WOMAN BECAUSE SHE TELLS HER FRIENDS WHICH DOCTOR TO CALL IN BUT I OUGHTN'T TO
SHE OBSERVED AS SHE REFLECTED THAT IN GOPHER PRAIRIE IT IS NOT DECENT TO CALL ON A MAN AS SHE DECIDED THAT NO REALLY SHE WOULDN'T GO IN AND AS SHE WENT IN I DIDN'T KNOW YOUR OFFICE WAS UP HERE
FAUSTUS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED HIS AGONIZING PRAYER WHEN A SUDDEN SPASM OF ACTIVITY ATTACKED MY DRIVER A SUCCESSION OF WHIP SNAPPINGS LIKE A PACK OF CHINESE CRACKERS BROKE FROM THE BOX BEFORE ME THE STAGE LEAPED FORWARD
I PICKED IT UP WITH AN INTEREST THAT HOWEVER SOON ABATED THERE WAS NO SCENT OF THE ROSES TO CLING TO IT STILL NOT EVEN OF HAIR OIL NO BEND OR TWIST IN ITS RIGID ANGLES BETRAYED ANY TRAIT OF ITS WEARER'S CHARACTER
LET ME ASSURE THE READER THAT I HAVE NO ULTERIOR DESIGN IN MAKING THIS ASSERTION
IT WAS RETICENT AND UNSWERVING IN ITS UPRIGHT FIDELITY AND AT LAST SLIPPED LISTLESSLY THROUGH MY FINGERS I HAD DOZED REPEATEDLY WAKED ON THE THRESHOLD OF OBLIVION BY CONTACT WITH SOME OF THE ANGLES OF THE COACH
INEQUALITIES OF THE ROAD ONLY QUICKENED ITS UTTERANCE OR DRAWLED IT TO AN EXASPERATING LENGTH IT WAS OF NO USE TO CONSIDER THE STATEMENT SERIOUSLY IT WAS OF NO USE TO EXCEPT TO IT INDIGNANTLY
DESERVES TO BE DETECTED I AM RELIEVED TO SAY THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS OCCURRED TO ME THE ROAD FROM WINGDAM TO SLUMGULLION KNEW NO OTHER BANDITTI THAN THE REGULARLY LICENSED HOTELKEEPERS
GUY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING WITH THE TOWN REALLY NO WE CAN'T HE DISPOSED OF IT LIKE A JUDGE RULING OUT AN IMPROPER OBJECTION RETURNED TO MATTERS LESS UNCOMFORTABLY ENERGETIC CURIOUS
IT HAD AN INDESCRIBABLY UNREAL AND THEATRICAL EFFECT IT WAS THE FULL MOON OF NORMA THAT REMARKABLE CELESTIAL PHENOMENON WHICH RISES SO PALPABLY TO A HUSHED AUDIENCE AND A SUBLIME ANDANTE CHORUS UNTIL THE CASTA DIVA IS SUNG
HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS TABLE DESK FINGERING THE STARRY ENAMELED VASE SHE COULD NOT COMMENT SHE PICTURED HERSELF RUNNING ACROSS THE ROOM TO PAT HIS HAIR SHE SAW THAT HIS LIPS WERE FIRM UNDER HIS SOFT FADED MUSTACHE
ALONG WITH GENERAL GRANT'S SWORD AND I'M OH I SUPPOSE I'M SEEKING FOR A GOSPEL THAT WILL EVANGELIZE GOPHER PRAIRIE REALLY EVANGELIZE IT TO WHAT TO ANYTHING THAT'S DEFINITE SERIOUSNESS OR FRIVOLOUSNESS OR BOTH
WHEN I BECAME AWARE OF SOME OTHER ANNOYANCE THAT HAD BEEN FORCING ITSELF UPON ME FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HOW QUIET THE DRIVER WAS WAS THERE ANY DRIVER HAD I ANY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS NOT LYING GAGGED AND BOUND ON THE ROADSIDE
CHAMP IS THE SALT OF THE EARTH BUT SOMEHOW I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM JOINING YOU IN SYMBOLIC DANCING OR MAKING IMPROVEMENTS ON THE DIESEL ENGINE NO HE'S A DEAR SOUL BLESS HIM BUT HE BELONGS IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM
WHEN I STRETCHED OUT MY LIMBS IT WAS ONLY TO FIND THAT THE ORDINARY CONVENIENCES FOR MAKING SEVERAL PEOPLE DISTINCTLY UNCOMFORTABLE WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT MY INDIVIDUAL FRAME AT LAST RESTING MY ARMS ON THE STRAPS
WHOSE RUMINATING REPOSE UPON THE HIGHWAY WE HAD RUTHLESSLY DISTURBED BUT IN THE DARKNESS OUR PROGRESS MORE THE GUIDANCE OF SOME MYSTERIOUS INSTINCT THAN ANY APPARENT VOLITION OF OUR OWN GAVE AN INDEFINABLE CHARM OF SECURITY TO OUR JOURNEY
IT IS A DARK NIGHT AND I FALL ASLEEP AND TELL MY HONEST COACHMAN ANDRE NOT TO DISTURB ME AND DREAM OF AN ANGEL THE CARRIAGE AT LAST STOPS AT THE CHATEAU
WHEN I LEFT THE DINING ROOM WITH AN ODD FEELING THAT I HAD BEEN SUPPING EXCLUSIVELY ON MUSTARD AND TEA LEAVES I STOPPED A MOMENT AT THE PARLOR DOOR A PIANO HARMONIOUSLY RELATED TO THE DINNER BELL
THAT A MOMENT'S HESITATION OR INDECISION ON THE PART OF THE DRIVER WOULD HAVE DESTROYED I HAD INDULGED A HOPE THAT IN THE EMPTY VEHICLE I MIGHT OBTAIN THAT REST SO OFTEN DENIED ME IN ITS CROWDED CONDITION IT WAS A WEAK DELUSION
I WENT TO A DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGE AND LEARNED THAT SINCE DICTATING THE BIBLE AND HIRING A PERFECT RACE OF MINISTERS TO EXPLAIN IT GOD HAS NEVER DONE MUCH BUT CREEP AROUND AND TRY TO CATCH US DISOBEYING IT FROM COLLEGE I WENT TO NEW YORK TO THE COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL
FROM THE TOP GALLERY I WALKED IN GRAMERCY PARK AND I READ OH EVERYTHING THROUGH A COUSIN I LEARNED THAT JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH WAS SICK AND NEEDED A PARTNER I CAME HERE JULIUS GOT WELL
LUNATICS HAD NOT YET REACHED SUCH DEPTH OF IMBECILITY AS TO RIDE OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL IN CALIFORNIA STAGES AND MY LAURA AMIABLE AND LONG SUFFERING AS SHE ALWAYS IS COULD NOT I FEAR
AND THE HIGHWAYMAN WITH BLACKENED FACE WHO DID THE THING SO QUIETLY DRIVING ME WHITHER THE THING IS PERFECTLY FEASIBLE AND WHAT IS THIS FANCY NOW BEING JOLTED OUT OF ME A STORY IT'S OF NO USE TO KEEP IT BACK
HERE IN GOPHER PRAIRIE WE'VE CLEARED THE FIELDS AND BECOME SOFT SO WE MAKE OURSELVES UNHAPPY ARTIFICIALLY AT GREAT EXPENSE AND EXERTION METHODISTS DISLIKING EPISCOPALIANS THE MAN WITH THE HUDSON LAUGHING AT THE MAN WITH THE FLIVVER
AND I'VE NEVER THOUGHT TO CALL I'M HORRIBLY ASHAMED DO BRING THEM SHE STOPPED FOR NO VERY CLEAR REASON BUT HIS EXPRESSION SAID HER FALTERING ADMITTED THAT THEY WISHED THEY HAD NEVER MENTIONED THE DILLONS
EVEN IN THE DARKNESS THE RED DUST OF WINGDAM WAS VISIBLE ON ITS ROOF AND SIDES AND THE RED SLIME OF SLUMGULLION CLUNG TENACIOUSLY TO ITS WHEELS I OPENED THE DOOR THE STAGE CREAKED EASILY
SO WE DID TWO HOURS AGO THAT'S ODD I DIDN'T NOTICE IT
A MARQUIS BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC READER DELIGHTS IN THE NOBILITY MY NAME IS SOMETHING LIGNY
YOU ARE WITHIN YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS IN REFUSING TO BE SUBJECTED TO THIS SUMMING UP I'M A TEDIOUS OLD FOOL ANALYZING THE OBVIOUS WHILE YOU'RE THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION TELL ME YOUR SIDE WHAT IS GOPHER PRAIRIE TO YOU A BORE
AND FEELING THAT I WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ASSUMING IN IMITATION OF A HUMBLE INSECT OF MY CHILDISH RECOLLECTION THAT SPHERICAL SHAPE WHICH COULD BEST RESIST THOSE IMPRESSIONS WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT THE MOON RIDING HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
HAD BEGUN TO SEPARATE THE FORMLESS MASSES OF THE SHADOWY LANDSCAPE TREES ISOLATED IN CLUMPS AND ASSEMBLAGES CHANGED PLACES BEFORE MY WINDOW THE SHARP OUTLINES OF THE DISTANT HILLS CAME BACK AS IN DAYLIGHT
SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY YOU WHY DO YOU STAY HERE I HAVE THE VILLAGE VIRUS IT SOUNDS DANGEROUS IT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CANCER THAT WILL CERTAINLY GET ME AT FIFTY UNLESS I STOP THIS SMOKING
BUT THERE IS A DOOR AND IT OPENS AND SHUTS BEHIND ME SMARTLY THEN I FIND MYSELF IN A TRAP IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BRIGAND WHO HAS QUIETLY GAGGED POOR ANDRE AND CONDUCTED THE CARRIAGE THITHER THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME TO DO AS A GALLANT FRENCH MARQUIS BUT TO SAY
THE DIAGNOSIS OF MY VILLAGE VIRUS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH I WAS BORN IN AN OHIO TOWN ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS GOPHER PRAIRIE AND MUCH LESS FRIENDLY IT'D HAD MORE GENERATIONS IN WHICH TO FORM AN OLIGARCHY OF RESPECTABILITY
A NUMBER OF INFINITESIMAL ANNOYANCES WINDING UP WITH THE RESOLUTE PERSISTENCY OF THE CLERK AT THE STAGE OFFICE TO ENTER MY NAME MISSPELT ON THE WAYBILL HAD NOT PREDISPOSED ME TO CHEERFULNESS
THE WIDOW ROBBING DEACON OF FICTION CAN'T HELP BEING HYPOCRITICAL THE WIDOWS THEMSELVES DEMAND IT THEY ADMIRE HIS UNCTUOUSNESS AND LOOK AT ME SUPPOSE I DID DARE TO MAKE LOVE TO SOME EXQUISITE MARRIED WOMAN I WOULDN'T ADMIT IT TO MYSELF
THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GIVE IN AND I WAS ABOUT TO ACCEPT IT WEAKLY AS WE TOO OFTEN TREAT OTHER ILLUSIONS OF DARKNESS AND NECESSITY FOR THE TIME BEING
CHECKING THE COMPLIMENT THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE RISEN UNBIDDEN TO MY LIPS AND HAVE BROUGHT SHAME AND SORROW TO THE HOUSEHOLD IT WAS WITH THE MEMORY OF THESE EXPERIENCES RESTING HEAVILY UPON ME THAT I STOOD HESITATINGLY BEFORE THE STAGE DOOR
OH WHAT IS THERE TO CONFIDE THE PEOPLE ARE SAVORLESS AND PROUD OF IT AND EVEN IF I LIKED YOU TREMENDOUSLY I COULDN'T TALK TO YOU WITHOUT TWENTY OLD HEXES WATCHING WHISPERING
FREQUENT AND FULL EXPECTORATION CONVINCED ME THAT HIS LIPS WERE AS YET NOT SEALED BY THE GAG OF HIGHWAYMEN AND SOOTHED MY ANXIOUS EAR
YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING THAT OF COURSE I ALWAYS SHALL PLEASE TRY THIS CHAIR SHE GLANCED ABOUT THE RUSTY OFFICE GAUNT STOVE SHELVES OF TAN LAW BOOKS DESK CHAIR FILLED WITH NEWSPAPERS SO LONG SAT UPON
THE FOUR OF THEM DRANK RATHER BAD COFFEE WHICH POLLOCK MADE ON A KEROSENE BURNER THEY LAUGHED AND SPOKE OF MINNEAPOLIS AND WERE TREMENDOUSLY TACTFUL
I FEEL LIKE A CHILD YET I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR FATHER SO IT'S DECENTLY PATERNAL TO IMAGINE YOU CURLED AT MY FEET OF COURSE I HOPE IT ISN'T BUT WE'LL REFLECT THE MORALS OF GOPHER PRAIRIE BY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCING THAT IT IS THESE STANDARDS THAT YOU AND I LIVE UP TO
PRAISE TO THE FACE IS OPEN DISGRACE I HEARD NO MORE DREADING SOME SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SINCERE EXPRESSION ON THE SUBJECT OF FEMALE LOVELINESS I WALKED AWAY
BUT NOT YET ACQUIRED THE SMELL OF PATCHOULI OR OF FACTORY SMOKE ARE JUST AS SUSPICIOUS AND RIGHTEOUS I WONDER IF THE SMALL TOWN ISN'T WITH SOME LOVELY EXCEPTIONS A SOCIAL APPENDIX SOME DAY THESE DULL MARKET TOWNS MAY BE AS OBSOLETE AS MONASTERIES
AND THE NIGHT AND ITS SHADOWS MOVED SOLEMNLY UPON US TO SAY IT WAS DARK EXPRESSED BUT FAINTLY THE PITCHY OBSCURITY THAT ENCOMPASSED THE VEHICLE THE ROADSIDE TREES WERE SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE AS DEEPER MASSES OF SHADOW
WITH SPURIOUS ENTHUSIASM HE SAID SPLENDID I WILL FROM THE DOOR HE GLANCED AT HER CURLED IN THE PEELED LEATHER CHAIR HE SLIPPED OUT CAME BACK WITH DOCTOR AND MISSUS DILLON
REMAINED FOR A MOMENT IN SERIOUS AND EXPECTORATIVE CONTEMPLATION OF THE BOOT AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS COLUMN THERE WAS SOMETHING SO WEIRD IN THIS BAPTISM THAT I GREW QUITE NERVOUS PERHAPS I WAS OUT OF SPIRITS
HE GRINNED OH MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE WHEN WILL HAS POSITIVELY KNOWN OF A CASE WHERE DOCTOR
A LONELY RIDE AS I STEPPED INTO THE SLUMGULLION STAGE I SAW THAT IT WAS A DARK NIGHT A LONELY ROAD
AND WHEN I COULD PICK MYSELF FROM UNDER THE SEAT A LONG WHITE BUILDING HAD IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY ROLLED BEFORE MY WINDOW IT MUST BE SLUMGULLION AS I DESCENDED FROM THE STAGE I ADDRESSED THE DRIVER I THOUGHT YOU CHANGED HORSES ON THE ROAD
THE STORYTELLER WHO WILLFULLY TEMPTS FATE BY SUCH OBVIOUS BEGINNINGS WHO IS TO THE EXPECTANT READER IN DANGER OF BEING ROBBED OR HALF MURDERED OR FRIGHTENED BY AN ESCAPED LUNATIC OR INTRODUCED TO HIS LADYLOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME
A GRAYHOUND ON THE SCENT A GRAYHOUND WITH GLASSES TILTED FORWARD ON HIS THIN NOSE AND A SILKY INDECISIVE BROWN MUSTACHE HE HAD A GOLF JACKET OF JERSEY WORN THROUGH AT THE CREASES IN THE SLEEVES SHE NOTED
IT'S MERELY I'M A CONFIRMED DOUBTER OF MYSELF PROBABLY I'M CONCEITED ABOUT MY LACK OF CONCEIT ANYWAY GOPHER PRAIRIE ISN'T PARTICULARLY BAD IT'S LIKE ALL VILLAGES IN ALL COUNTRIES MOST PLACES THAT HAVE LOST THE SMELL OF EARTH
I KNEW THEM ONLY BY THE PECULIAR SODDEN ODOR THAT FROM TIME TO TIME SLUGGISHLY FLOWED IN AT THE OPEN WINDOW AS WE ROLLED BY WE PROCEEDED SLOWLY SO LEISURELY THAT LEANING FROM THE CARRIAGE I MORE THAN ONCE DETECTED THE FRAGRANT SIGH OF SOME ASTONISHED COW
ON A SWING SHELF WAS A ROW OF BOOKS UNFAMILIAR TO GOPHER PRAIRIE MOSHER EDITIONS OF THE POETS BLACK AND RED GERMAN NOVELS A CHARLES LAMB IN CRUSHED LEVANT GUY DID NOT SIT DOWN HE QUARTERED THE OFFICE
HAVE BORNE UP AGAINST THESE DEPRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION ON ME I STOOD WITH MY SHAWL AND CARPETBAG IN HAND GAZING DOUBTINGLY ON THE VEHICLE
THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S THE MATTER WITH GOPHER PRAIRIE AT LEAST WITH THE RULING CLASS THERE IS A RULING CLASS DESPITE ALL OUR PROFESSIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE PENALTY WE TRIBAL RULERS PAY IS THAT OUR SUBJECTS WATCH US EVERY MINUTE
WHERE ONE OF THE OTHERS HAS CONTINUED TO CALL ON PATIENTS LONGER THAN NECESSARY HE HAS LAUGHED ABOUT IT BUT HE STILL GRINNED NO REALLY AND WHEN YOU SAY THE WIVES OF THE DOCTORS SHARE THESE JEALOUSIES
WITH THIS LOAD LIFTED FROM MY MIND AND ASSISTED BY THE MILD PRESENCE OF DIANA WHO LEFT AS WHEN SHE VISITED ENDYMION MUCH OF HER SPLENDOR OUTSIDE MY CAVERN I LOOKED AROUND THE EMPTY VEHICLE ON THE FORWARD SEAT LAY A WOMAN'S HAIRPIN
A LOUNGER ON THE STEPS OF THE HOTEL WHO I HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE WAS NOT IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE STAGE COMPANY GRAVELY DESCENDED AND WALKING TOWARD THE CONVEYANCE TRIED THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR OPENED IT EXPECTORATED IN THE CARRIAGE
PARBLEU DRAW MY RAPIER AND DIE VALOROUSLY I AM FOUND A WEEK OR TWO AFTER OUTSIDE A DESERTED CABARET NEAR THE BARRIER WITH A HOLE THROUGH MY RUFFLED LINEN AND MY POCKETS STRIPPED NO ON SECOND THOUGHTS I AM RESCUED
OBEYING THIS PRINCIPLE ALL HILARITY CEASED ON MY ENTRANCE TO SUPPER AND GENERAL REMARK MERGED INTO THE SAFER AND UNCOMPROMISING CHRONICLE OF SEVERAL BAD CASES OF DIPHTHERIA THEN EPIDEMIC AT WINGDAM
OF NO USE TO EXCEPT TO THE MYSTERIOUS FEMALE TO PICTURE HER AS REARING A THIN BLOODED GENERATION ON SELFISH AND MECHANICALLY REPEATED AXIOMS ALL THIS FAILED TO COUNTERACT THE MONOTONOUS REPETITION OF THIS SENTENCE
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS TALKING TO A PATENT LAWYER FROM CHICAGO AND I REALIZED THAT I'D ALWAYS FELT SO SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE LIKE JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH BUT I SAW THAT I WAS AS PROVINCIAL AND BEHIND THE TIMES AS JULIUS WORSE
I FOUND MY EYES WERE GROWING ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARKNESS
WHEN I GET HOLD OF ONE IN CHICAGO YET I SHOULDN'T EVEN TRY TO HOLD YOUR HAND I'M BROKEN IT'S THE HISTORICAL ANGLO SAXON WAY OF MAKING LIFE MISERABLE
ONE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM BEING CARRIED AWAY INTO SLAVERY AND ONE TO KEEP THEIR TOWN FROM BEING BURNED THE SAME PUNISHMENTS WOULD BE INFLICTED UPON THEM FOR TWO WEEKS THE PIRATES WAITED FOR THE UNFORTUNATE CITIZENS TO GO OUT INTO THE COUNTRY
CHAPTER SIXTEEN A PIRATE POTENTATE SOMETIME IN THE LAST HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ON A QUIET FARM IN A SECLUDED PART OF WALES THERE WAS BORN A LITTLE BOY BABY
IT WAS NECESSARY TO START OUT AGAIN AND COMMIT SOME MORE ACTS OF ROBBERY AND RUIN AND L'OLONNOIS WHOSE RAPACIOUS MIND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH A DESIRE FOR TOWN DESTROYING PROJECTED AN EXPEDITION TO NICARAGUA
A NEGRO WAS CAPTURED WHO CARRIED LETTERS FROM THE GOVERNOR OF SANTIAGO A NEIGHBORING CITY
WHEN MORGAN CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THIS BARRICADE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SPANIARDS HAD DISCOVERED HIS APPROACH AND SO HE CALLED A HALT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN OPPOSED TO UNNECESSARY WORK
AND TOOK THE MARROW BONES WHICH THEY COOKED AND ATE WHILE THEY WERE FRESH ONE OF THE MEN A FRENCHMAN HAD SELECTED A VERY FINE BONE AND HAD PUT IT BY HIS SIDE WHILE HE WAS PREPARING SOME OTHER TIDBITS WHEN AN ENGLISHMAN CAME ALONG PICKED UP THE BONE
BUT A VERY SHREWD WELSHMAN THEY RETURNED TO THE SHIPS AND AFTER TOUCHING AT SAINT CATHERINE
WHICH GREW IN ABUNDANCE IN THOSE REGIONS IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT CATCH HIMSELF A SUPPER WHEN HE REACHED THE SEA AFTER A TIME THE BUCCANEERS GOT BACK TO THEIR FLEET AND REMAINED ON THE COAST ABOUT THREE MONTHS
BUT THEIR HIGH HOPES HAD NOT BEEN REALIZED THEY HAD HAD VERY LITTLE BOOTY AND VERY LITTLE FOOD THEY WERE HUNGRY AND DISAPPOINTED AND WANTED TO GO HOME AND THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THEM DECLINED TO FOLLOW L'OLONNOIS ANY FARTHER
WHEN THIS HAD BEEN DONE THEY FELT SAFE AND BEGAN TO ACT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN A MENAGERIE OF WILD BEASTS LET LOOSE UPON A BODY OF DEFENCELESS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN NOT ONLY DID THESE WRETCHED MEN RUSH INTO THE HOUSES STEALING EVERYTHING VALUABLE THEY COULD FIND AND WERE ABLE TO CARRY AWAY
IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT ANY PRINCIPLE OF RIGHT AND JUSTICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN REGARDED BY THESE DISHONEST KNAVES EVEN IN THEIR RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY HAD RIGID RULES IN REGARD TO THE DIVISION OF THEIR SPOILS
MORGAN ESTIMATED THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE BOOTY TO BE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WHEN THIS COMPARATIVELY SMALL SUM WAS DIVIDED MANY OF THE MEN COMPLAINED THAT IT WOULD NOT GIVE THEM ENOUGH TO PAY THEIR DEBTS IN JAMAICA THEY WERE UTTERLY ASTONISHED
THEY SWARMED OVER THE WALLS AND CARRIED THE PLACE AT THE EDGE OF THE CUTLASS AND THE MOUTH OF THE PISTOL IN THIS FIERCE FIGHT MORGAN PERFORMED SUCH FEATS OF VALOR THAT EVEN SOME OF THE SPANIARDS WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONERS WERE FORCED TO PRAISE HIS EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE
THEY COULD NOT SWIM AWAY AND THEIR SHIP WAS OF NO USE TO THEM AS SHE WAS BUT WHEN THEY BEGAN TO WORK THEY HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD TAKE SO LONG TO BUILD A BOAT IT WAS SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THE UNWIELDY CRAFT WAS FINISHED
AND MADE BREAD FROM SOME WHEAT WHICH WAS AMONG THEIR PROVISIONS THUS MANAGING TO LIVE VERY WELL L'OLONNOIS WAS NEVER INTENDED BY NATURE TO BE A BOAT BUILDER OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WAS USEFUL AND HONEST AND WHEN THE BOAT WAS FINISHED IT WAS DISCOVERED
THEY TORTURED THE POOR PEOPLE TO MAKE THEM TELL WHERE THEY HAD HID THEIR TREASURES AND NOTHING WAS TOO VILE OR TOO WICKED FOR THEM TO DO IF THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD PROFIT BY IT THEY HAD COME FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF TAKING EVERYTHING THAT THE PEOPLE POSSESSED
WHERE THEY HOPED TO BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT IF THEY COULD FIND NOTHING ELSE THEY MIGHT AT LEAST CATCH FISH ON THEIR WAY EVERY RASCAL OF THEM PREPARED HIMSELF A NET
THEIR GREAT OBJECT WAS TO TAKE EVERYTHING THEY COULD FIND AND THEN TRY TO MAKE THE PEOPLE CONFESS WHERE OTHER THINGS WERE HIDDEN MEN AND WOMEN WERE HACKED TO PIECES WITH SWORDS
THE SPANISH GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE HAD HEARD OF THEIR APPROACH AND MET THEM WITH A BODY OF SOLDIERS SO LARGE THAT THEY PRUDENTLY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT A PROCEEDING NOT VERY COMMON WITH THEM BUT MORGAN WAS NOT ONLY A DARE DEVIL OF A PIRATE
FOR A MISSING LEFT LEG FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FOUR SLAVES FOR AN EYE OR A FINGER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
HIS FATHER WAS A FARMER AND HIS MOTHER CHURNED AND TENDED THE COWS AND THE CHICKENS AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO IMAGINE THAT THIS GENTLE LITTLE BABY BORN AND REARED IN THIS RURAL SOLITUDE
IT WAS AT LAST ARRANGED THAT THE CITIZENS SHOULD PAY TWENTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WHICH WAS THE UTMOST SUM THEY COULD POSSIBLY RAISE AND IN ADDITION TO THIS FIVE HUNDRED HEAD OF BEEF CATTLE
AND IF THEY COULD CAPTURE THEM THEY MIGHT ASK AS RANSOM FOR THEM A SUM A GREAT DEAL LARGER THAN THEY COULD EXPECT TO GET FROM THE PILLAGE OF AN ORDINARY TOWN BUT HAVANA WAS CONSIDERED TO BE TOO STRONG A PLACE FOR A PROFITABLE VENTURE
THEY TOOK WITH THEM EVERYTHING OF VALUE THAT THEY COULD CARRY IF THEIR FORTUNES HAD BEEN DEPOSITED IN BANKS IT WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE PIRATES BEFORE THE CITIZENS RETURNED MORGAN MADE A DISCOVERY
THIS EXPEDITION SEEMED A PROMISING ONE TO MORGAN AND HE JOINED IT BEING ELECTED VICE ADMIRAL OF THE FLEET OF FIFTEEN VESSELS SINCE THE SUCCESSES OF L'OLONNOIS AND OTHERS ATTACKS UPON TOWNS HAD BECOME VERY POPULAR WITH THE BUCCANEERS
THAT UNLESS IN THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS A RANSOM OF TEN THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WERE PAID TO THEM THEY WOULD BURN THE TOWN TO THE GROUND NO MATTER WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THIS HEARTLESS DEMAND IT WAS NOT EASY FOR THE SCATTERED CITIZENS TO COLLECT SUCH A SUM AS THIS
HAD THE SEED THUS PLANTED BY MANSVELT AND MORGAN GROWN AND MATURED IT IS NOT UNLIKELY THAT THE WHOLE OF THE WEST INDIES MIGHT NOW BE OWNED AND INHABITED BY AN INDEPENDENT NATION WHOSE FOUNDERS WERE THE BOLD BUCCANEERS
AND THEY MIGHT NOW HAVE SAILED BACK TO THE ISLAND WHERE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR COMRADES
WHERE HE PROPOSED TO PILLAGE AND DEVASTATE AS MANY TOWNS AND VILLAGES AS POSSIBLE HIS REPUTATION AS A SUCCESSFUL COMMANDER WAS NOW SO HIGH THAT HE HAD NO TROUBLE IN GETTING MEN FOR MORE OFFERED THEMSELVES THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY TAKE
NEARLY ALL THE BUCCANEERS WERE KILLED AND L'OLONNOIS WAS TAKEN PRISONER HIS FURIOUS CAPTORS TORE HIS LIVING BODY APART PIECE BY PIECE AND THREW EACH FRAGMENT INTO THE FIRE
IF THEY HAD BEEN ATTACKED FROM ABOVE BY MEANS OF BALLOONS OR FROM BELOW BY MINES AND EXPLOSIVES THEY WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE ADAPTED THEIR STYLE OF DEFENCE TO THE METHOD OF ATTACK THEY ALWAYS DID THIS AND ACCORDING TO ESQUEMELING THEY NEARLY ALWAYS GOT THE BETTER OF THEIR ENEMIES
AND HERE THE YOUNG MAN DETERMINED TO STUDY PIRACY HE WAS NOT A SAILOR AND HUNTER
SENT A COMMITTEE TO CONFER WITH THE PIRATES AND WHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE GOING ON SOME OF THE CONSCIENCELESS BUCCANEERS WENT ON SHORE AND CARRIED OFF FROM ONE OF THE GREAT CHURCHES ITS IMAGES PICTURES AND EVEN ITS BELLS
BUT HE DELIBERATELY SELECTED HIS PROFESSION AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO ACQUIRE A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS PRACTICE THERE WAS A BUCCANEER SHIP ABOUT TO SAIL FROM JAMAICA AND ON THIS MORGAN ENLISTED HE WAS A CLEVER FELLOW
THE FLEET SAILED DIRECTLY FOR SAINT CATHERINE AN ISLAND NEAR COSTA RICA WHICH WAS STRONGLY FORTIFIED BY THE SPANIARDS AND USED BY THEM AS A STATION FOR AMMUNITION AND SUPPLIES AND ALSO AS A PRISON
AND THE SPANIARDS GATHERED TOGETHER A SUFFICIENT FORCE TO RETAKE THE ISLAND OF SAINT CATHERINE
SO HE DECIDED NOT TO WAIT FOR THE UNFORTUNATE CITIZENS TO COLLECT THE HEAVY RANSOM HE DEMANDED BUT TOLD THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH FIVE HUNDRED HEAD OF CATTLE AND ALSO SUPPLY SALT AND HELP PREPARE THE MEAT FOR SHIPMENT HE WOULD MAKE NO FURTHER DEMANDS UPON THEM
BUT AFTER THE PROJECT FAILED HE SET ABOUT FORMING ANOTHER EXPEDITION HE WAS NOW RECOGNIZED AS BUCCANEER IN CHIEF OF THE WEST INDIES AND HE VERY SOON GATHERED TOGETHER TWELVE SHIPS AND SEVEN HUNDRED MEN EVERYTHING WAS MADE READY TO SAIL
BRAVOS OR WILD MEN THESE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE WHITES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONQUER THEM OR TO PACIFY THEM BY KIND TREATMENT THEY HATED THE WHITE MAN AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM
THEY DEVASTATED LITTLE TOWNS TAKING EVERYTHING THAT THEY CARED FOR AND BURNING WHAT THEY DID NOT WANT AND TREATING THE PEOPLE THEY CAPTURED WITH VILER CRUELTIES THAN ANY IN WHICH THE BUCCANEERS HAD YET INDULGED
INTO THE LITTLE VILLAGES AND PLANTATIONS IN THE COUNTRY AND EVEN HUNTERS AND SMALL FARMERS WERE CAPTURED AND MADE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THEY POSSESSED WHICH WAS WORTH TAKING FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS THESE OUTRAGEOUS PROCEEDINGS CONTINUED
THAT IT HAD BEEN PLANNED SO BADLY THAT IT WOULD NOT HOLD THEM ALL SO ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO DRAW LOTS TO SEE WHO SHOULD EMBARK IN HER FOR ONE HALF OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO STAY UNTIL THE OTHERS CAME BACK TO RELEASE THEM
AT LAST A DESERTER FROM THE SPANISH ARMY WHO HAD JOINED THEM CAME FORWARD WITH A GOOD IDEA HE TOLD THE PIRATES OF A TOWN IN CUBA TO WHICH HE KNEW THE WAY IT WAS NAMED
HERE HE FOUND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT HIS WAY INTO THE CITY AND PROBABLY MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE HIS MEN WERE PRESENTLY CHARGED BY A BODY OF CAVALRY PIRATES AS A RULE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HORSES EITHER IN PEACE OR WAR
BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN CASES WHERE THEY DID NOT SUCCEED AS HAPPENED WHEN THEY MARCHED AGAINST THE TOWN OF NATA HE SAYS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE AFFAIR AND AMPLIFIES ONLY THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR SUCCESSES BUT THE PIRATES ROUTED THE HORSEMEN
RETURNING FROM ONE OF HIS VOYAGES MORGAN FOUND AN OLD BUCCANEER NAMED MANSVELT IN JAMAICA WHO HAD GATHERED TOGETHER A FLEET OF VESSELS
AND THEREFORE COULD GIVE NO INFORMATION TO THEIR BRUTAL INQUISITORS AND OTHERS DIED WITHOUT TELLING WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH THEIR VALUABLES WHEN THE TOWN HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY SEARCHED AND SIFTED THE PIRATES SENT MEN OUT
THESE BLOODY PIRATES HAD ALWAYS CONQUERED IN THEIR DESPERATE FIGHTS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO RECKLESS AND SO SAVAGE BUT NOW THEY HAD FALLEN AMONG THOROUGHBRED SAVAGES MORE CRUEL AND MORE BRUTAL AND PITILESS THAN THEMSELVES
AND FIND SOME OF THEIR TOWNSMEN WHO HAD ESCAPED WITH A PORTION OF THEIR TREASURE IN THOSE DAYS PEOPLE DID NOT KEEP THEIR WEALTH IN BANKS AS THEY DO NOW BUT EVERY MAN WAS THE CUSTODIAN OF MOST OF HIS OWN POSSESSIONS AND WHEN THEY FLED FROM THE VISITATION OF AN ENEMY
BUT WENT TO THE COAST OF CARTAGENA THE PIRATES LEFT ON THE ISLAND WERE EVENTUALLY TAKEN OFF BY A BUCCANEERING VESSEL BUT L'OLONNOIS HAD NOW REACHED THE END OF THE STRING BY WHICH THE DEVIL HAD ALLOWED HIM TO GAMBOL ON THIS EARTH FOR SO LONG A TIME
THEY DID NOT GO DIRECTLY TO TORTUGA BUT STOPPED AT A LITTLE ISLAND NEAR HISPANIOLA WHICH WAS INHABITED BY FRENCH BUCCANEERS AND THIS DELAY WAS MADE ENTIRELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIVIDING THE BOOTY
AND AMONG THEIR SPOILS WERE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SLAVES OF ALL AGES AND BOTH SEXES WHO HAD BEEN OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY TO RANSOM THEMSELVES BUT WHO OF COURSE HAD NO MONEY WITH WHICH TO BUY THEIR FREEDOM AND WHO WERE NOW CONDEMNED TO A CAPTIVITY
BUT AS SOON AS HE WAS A FREE MAN HE WENT TO JAMAICA AND THERE WERE FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE A YOUNG MAN COULD BE MORE FREE AND MORE INDEPENDENT THAN IN THIS LAWLESS ISLAND HERE WERE ROLLICKING AND BLUSTERING
WHEN YOUNG MORGAN REACHED THE BARBADOES HE WAS RESOLD TO A PLANTER AND DURING HIS TERM OF SERVICE HE PROBABLY WORKED A GOOD DEAL HARDER AND WAS TREATED MUCH MORE ROUGHLY THAN ANY OF THE LABORERS ON HIS FATHER'S FARM
AND THE ONLY THING LEFT TO BE DONE WAS TO DECIDE WHAT PARTICULAR PLACE THEY SHOULD FAVOR WITH A VISIT THERE WERE SOME WHO ADVISED AN ATTACK UPON HAVANA GIVING AS A REASON THAT IN THAT CITY THERE WERE A GREAT MANY NUNS MONKS AND PRIESTS
AND THEY OCCUPIED PART OF THE TIME IN GARDENING PLANTING FRENCH BEANS WHICH CAME TO MATURITY IN SIX WEEKS AND GAVE THEM SOME FRESH VEGETABLES
THERE WAS HOWEVER ANOTHER CAUSE OF DISCONTENT AMONG A LARGE BODY OF THE MEN IT APPEARS THAT THE MEN WERE VERY FOND OF MARROW BONES
AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN NO DOUBT THOUGHT THAT WHEN HIS WELL ARMED HORSEMEN CHARGED UPON THESE MEN ACCUSTOMED TO FIGHTING ON THE DECKS OF SHIPS AND TOTALLY UNUSED TO CAVALRY COMBATS HE WOULD SOON SCATTER AND DISPERSE THEM BUT PIRATES ARE PECULIAR FIGHTERS
ON WHICH HE WISHED TO LAND IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE AN ACCOUNT OF STOCK AND DIVIDE THE PROFITS THIS THE PIRATES ALWAYS DID AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THEY HAD CONCLUDED ONE OF THEIR NEFARIOUS ENTERPRISES BUT HIS MEN WERE NOT AT ALL SATISFIED WITH WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ISLAND
AND THE PIRATES PROMISED THAT IF THIS WERE DONE THEY WOULD DEPART AND MOLEST THE TOWN NO MORE THE MONEY WAS PAID THE CATTLE WERE PUT ON BOARD THE SHIPS AND TO THE UNSPEAKABLE RELIEF OF THE CITIZENS
WHEN THEY FOUND IT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THEIR GREAT VESSEL OFF THE SAND BANKS THE PIRATES SET TO WORK TO BREAK HER UP AND BUILD A BOAT OUT OF HER PLANKS THIS WAS A SERIOUS UNDERTAKING BUT IT WAS ALL THEY COULD DO
AND TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE LOWER THAN THE BRUTE BEASTS THEY ALLOWED THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE PRISONERS COLLECTED IN THE CHURCH TO PERISH OF HUNGER THERE WERE NOT PROVISIONS ENOUGH IN THE TOWN FOR THE PIRATES OWN USES AND FOR THESE MISERABLE CREATURES ALSO AND SO
AND WERE OBLIGED TO LAND AND SCOUR THE COUNTRY TO FIND SOMETHING TO EAT LEAVING THEIR SHIPS THEY BEGAN A LAND MARCH THROUGH THE UNFORTUNATE REGION WHERE THEY NOW FOUND THEMSELVES THEY ROBBED INDIANS THEY ROBBED VILLAGES
BUT THERE WERE SOME WHO DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RATHER DIE THAN GO HOME TO TORTUGA AS POOR AS WHEN THEY LEFT IT
BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN MAKING A SECRET ATTACK AS HE HAD HOPED ONE OF HIS PRISONERS A SPANIARD LET HIMSELF DROP OVERBOARD AS SOON AS THE VESSELS CAST ANCHOR AND SWIMMING ASHORE
THE FRENCHMAN CHALLENGED THE ENGLISHMAN BUT THE LATTER BEING A MEAN SCOUNDREL TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIS OPPONENT UNFAIRLY STABBED HIM IN THE BACK AND KILLED HIM NOW ALL THE FRENCHMEN IN THE COMPANY ROSE IN FURIOUS PROTEST
WHICH HE COMMANDED THE SMALLER VESSELS NOW DEPARTED FOR TORTUGA
SO STRONG WAS HIS DISLIKE THAT WHEN HE BECAME A YOUNG MAN HE RAN AWAY TO THE SEACOAST FOR HE HAD A FANCY TO BE A SAILOR THERE HE FOUND A SHIP BOUND FOR THE WEST INDIES AND IN THIS HE STARTED OUT ON HIS LIFE'S CAREER
THEY FREQUENTLY MET AMBUSCADES OF SPANIARDS WHO ENDEAVORED TO STOP THEIR PROGRESS BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE PIRATES WERE TOO STRONG IN NUMBER AND TOO SAVAGE IN DISPOSITION TO BE RESISTED BY ORDINARY CHRISTIANS AND THEY KEPT ON THEIR WICKED WAY
NO OTHER BUCCANEERING VESSEL WAS SO WIDELY KNOWN AND SO GREATLY FEARED AND THE ENGLISH PEOPLE IN THESE REGIONS WERE AS PROUD OF THE YOUNG CAPTAIN MORGAN AS IF HE HAD BEEN A REGULARLY COMMISSIONED ADMIRAL CRUISING AGAINST AN ACKNOWLEDGED ENEMY
AND CONSEQUENTLY THE GREATER PART OF THEM BANDED TOGETHER AND DELIBERATELY DESERTED MORGAN WHO WAS OBLIGED TO GO BACK TO JAMAICA WITH NOT MORE THAN HALF HIS REGULAR FORCES
THEN THESE UTTERLY DEBASED AND CRUEL MEN BEGAN THEIR USUAL COURSE AFTER CAPTURING A TOWN THEY PILLAGED FEASTED AND RIOTED THEY GAVE NO THOUGHT TO THE NEEDS OF THE PRISONERS WHOM THEY HAD SHUT UP IN THE CHURCHES MANY OF WHOM STARVED TO DEATH
AND REACHED THE MOUTH OF THE NICARAGUA RIVER THERE HIS PARTY WAS ATTACKED BY SOME SPANIARDS AND INDIANS WHO KILLED MORE THAN HALF OF THEM AND PREVENTED THE OTHERS FROM LANDING
NO MORE DREADFUL MISERIES COULD BE CONCEIVED THAN THOSE INFLICTED UPON THE PEACEFUL INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THESE WRETCHES PASSED
AT LAST THEY REACHED A TOWN CALLED SAN PEDRO WHICH WAS FAIRLY WELL DEFENDED HAVING AROUND IT A GREAT HEDGE OF PRICKLY THORNS BUT THORNS CANNOT KEEP OUT PIRATES AND AFTER A SEVERE FIGHT
BUT THEY WERE NOT EXTINGUISHED UNTIL A QUARTER OF THE TOWN WAS ENTIRELY BURNED AND A FINE CHURCH REDUCED TO ASHES WHEN THE BUCCANEERS FOUND THEY COULD SQUEEZE NOTHING MORE OUT OF THE TOWN THEY WENT ON BOARD THEIR SHIPS CARRYING WITH THEM ALL THE PLUNDER AND BOOTY THEY HAD COLLECTED
THIS WAS GIVEN AND THE TIME WAS OCCUPIED BY THE PEOPLE IN RUNNING AWAY INTO THE WOODS AND CARRYING OFF THEIR VALUABLES BUT WHEN THE TWO HOURS HAD EXPIRED L'OLONNOIS AND HIS MEN ENTERED THE TOWN AND INSTEAD OF RUMMAGING AROUND TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD FIND
AND THE TWO DAYS PASSED WITHOUT THE PAYMENT OF THE RANSOM AND THE RELENTLESS PIRATES PROMPTLY CARRIED OUT THEIR THREAT AND SET THE TOWN ON FIRE IN VARIOUS PLACES WHEN THE POOR SPANIARDS SAW THIS AND PERCEIVED THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO LOSE EVEN THEIR HOMES
WAITING FOR SOME EXPECTED SPANISH SHIPS WHICH THEY HOPED TO CAPTURE THEY EVENTUALLY MET WITH ONE AND AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF ORDINARY FIGHTING AND STRATAGEM THEY BOARDED AND TOOK HER BUT FOUND HER NOT A VERY VALUABLE PRIZE
NOW L'OLONNOIS PROPOSED TO HIS MEN THAT THEY SHOULD SAIL FOR GUATEMALA BUT HE MET WITH AN UNEXPECTED OBSTACLE THE BUCCANEERS WHO HAD ENLISTED UNDER HIM HAD EXPECTED TO MAKE GREAT FORTUNES IN THIS EXPEDITION
THERE WAS PLENTY OF FRESH WATER AND THE GROUND COULD BE CULTIVATED
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL QUANTITY OF MULE FLESH WHICH MANY OF THE PRISONERS COULD NOT EAT THEY GOT NOTHING WHATEVER AND SLOWLY STARVED WHEN L'OLONNOIS AND HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN IN POSSESSION OF GIBRALTAR FOR ABOUT A MONTH
SO HE LEFT THE ROAD MARCHED HIS MEN INTO THE WOODS LED THEM ENTIRELY AROUND THE BARRICADES AND THEN AFTER PROCEEDING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE EMERGED UPON A WIDE PLAIN WHICH LAY BEFORE THE TOWN
I WENT TO TAFFY'S HOUSE TAFFY WASN'T HOME TAFFY WENT TO MY HOUSE AND STOLE A MARROW BONE WHAT HAPPENED TO TAFFY WE DO NOT KNOW BUT MORGAN WAS A WELSHMAN MORGAN WAS A THIEF AND ONE OF HIS MEN HAD STOLEN A MARROW BONE THEREFORE CAME TROUBLE
THIS WAS A BLOW TO MORGAN
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE BUT THEIR GREEDY SOULS WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE BOOTY THEY HAD ALREADY OBTAINED AND THEY THEREFORE SENT MESSAGES TO THE SPANIARDS WHO WERE STILL CONCEALED IN THE FORESTS
WHO DID NOT FIND PROVISIONS ENOUGH TO FEED HIS MEN THEIR SUPPLIES RAN VERY LOW AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF STARVATION CONSEQUENTLY THEY MADE THEIR WAY BY THE MOST DIRECT COURSE TO THE COAST
AND AFTER A FIGHT OF ABOUT FOUR HOURS THEY ROUTED ALL THE OTHER SPANIARDS WHO RESISTED THEM AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE TOWN HERE THEY CAPTURED A GREAT MANY PRISONERS WHICH THEY SHUT UP IN THE CHURCHES AND THEN SENT DETACHMENTS OUT INTO THE COUNTRY TO LOOK FOR THOSE WHO HAD RUN AWAY
THESE LATTER WERE APPORTIONED AMONG THE MEN IN THE MOST RIDICULOUS MANNER THE PIRATES HAVING NO IDEA OF THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE JEWELS SOME OF THEM PREFERRING LARGE AND WORTHLESS COLORED STONES TO SMALLER DIAMONDS AND RUBIES WHEN ALL THEIR WICKEDLY GAINED PROPERTY HAD BEEN DIVIDED
SO THAT HE COULD HOLD THE ISLAND AS A REGULAR STATION FOR THE ASSEMBLING AND FITTING OUT OF PIRATE VESSELS THE PERMANENT PIRATE COLONY NEVER CAME TO ANYTHING NO REENFORCEMENTS WERE SENT MANSVELT DIED
AND ABILITY AS A LEADER THE BUCCANEERS PROCEEDED TO MAKE VERY GOOD USE OF THEIR VICTORY THEY CAPTURED SOME SMALL ADJOINING ISLANDS AND BROUGHT THE CANNON FROM THEM TO THE MAIN FORTRESS
WHICH HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED BY THE MEN WHO HAD BEEN GATHERING THE CROP WHEN MORGAN'S FLEET ARRIVED AT THE NEAREST HARBOR TO PORT AU PRINCE
HE HAD NO MONEY TO PAY HIS PASSAGE AND HE THEREFORE FOLLOWED THE USUAL CUSTOM OF THOSE DAYS AND SOLD HIMSELF FOR A TERM OF THREE YEARS TO AN AGENT WHO WAS TAKING OUT A NUMBER OF MEN TO WORK ON THE PLANTATIONS
THE CLAIMS OF THE WOUNDED WERE FULLY SATISFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR ESTABLISHED CODE FOR THE LOSS OF A RIGHT ARM A MAN WAS PAID ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SIX SLAVES FOR THE LOSS OF A LEFT ARM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FIVE SLAVES
WORSE THAN ANYTHING THEY HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE NOW THE EIGHT SHIPS WITH THEIR DEMON CREWS SAILED AWAY OVER THE LAKE TOWARD MARACAIBO IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET OUT TO SEA WITHOUT REVISITING THIS UNFORTUNATE TOWN
THAT AFTER HAVING SACKED AN ENTIRELY FRESH TOWN THEY SHOULD HAVE SO LITTLE AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MANY OF THEM BELIEVED THAT THEIR LEADER WAS A MAN WHO CARRIED ON THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENRICHING HIMSELF WHILE HE GAVE HIS FOLLOWERS BARELY ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM QUIET
THERE WAS NOTHING ON EARTH THAT THEY WOULD BE SO GLAD TO FURNISH HIM AS A PILOT TO SHOW HIM HOW TO SAIL AWAY FROM THEIR SHORES THE PILOT WAS INSTANTLY SENT TO THE FLEET AND L'OLONNOIS AND HIS DEVASTATING BAND DEPARTED
WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE PIRATES THAT THE WORLD EVER KNEW YET SUCH WAS THE CASE THE BABY'S NAME WAS HENRY MORGAN AND AS HE GREW TO BE A BIG BOY
WHOSE LEADERS WERE GETTING TO BE TIRED OF THE RETAIL BRANCH OF THEIR BUSINESS THAT IS SAILING ABOUT IN ONE SHIP AND CAPTURING SUCH MERCHANTMEN AS IT MIGHT FALL IN WITH MANSVELT'S EXPEDITION TOOK WITH IT NOT ONLY SIX HUNDRED FIGHTING PIRATES BUT ONE WRITING PIRATE
AND CARRIED IT AWAY NOW EVEN IN THE CHRONICLES OF MOTHER GOOSE WE ARE TOLD OF THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN WELSHMEN THIEVERY AND MARROW BONES FOR TAFFY WAS A WELSHMAN TAFFY WAS A THIEF TAFFY CAME TO MY HOUSE AND STOLE A LEG OF BEEF
THEY SOLD THEIR VALUABLE MERCHANDISE FOR A TWENTIETH PART OF ITS VALUE TO SOME OF THE MORE LEVEL HEADED PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND HAVING RIOTED GAMBLED AND COMMITTED EVERY SORT OF EXTRAVAGANCE FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FIVE SLAVES
BUT WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THEY COULD DISCOVER THEY TORTURED THEIR POOR PRISONERS BY EVERY CRUEL METHOD THEY COULD THINK OF IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM TELL WHERE MORE TREASURES WERE CONCEALED MANY OF THESE UNFORTUNATES HAD HAD NOTHING TO HIDE
AND THEN HE SENT SOME MESSENGERS ASHORE TO INFORM THE ALREADY HALF RUINED CITIZENS THAT UNLESS THEY SENT HIM THIRTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT HE WOULD ENTER THEIR TOWN AGAIN CARRY AWAY EVERYTHING THEY HAD LEFT AND BURN THE PLACE TO THE GROUND THE POOR CITIZENS
FOUND THEMSELVES AS POOR AS WHEN THEY HAD STARTED OFF ON THEIR EXPEDITION IT TOOK THEM ALMOST AS LONG TO DIVIDE THEIR SPOILS AS IT DID TO GET RID OF THEM AS THESE PRECIOUS RASCALS HAD NOW NOTHING TO LIVE UPON
HE DEPARTED WITH SEVEN HUNDRED MEN AND SIX SHIPS STOPPING ON THE WAY NEAR THE COAST OF CUBA AND ROBBING SOME POOR FISHERMEN OF THEIR BOATS WHICH HE WOULD NEED IN SHALLOW WATER
THE PIRATES SAILED TO TORTUGA WHERE THEY PROCEEDED WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME TO GET RID OF THE WEALTH THEY HAD AMASSED THEY ATE THEY DRANK THEY GAMBLED THEY CROWDED THE TAVERNS AS TAVERNS HAVE NEVER BEEN CROWDED BEFORE
AND PROMISED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIM TO JAMAICA AND DELIVER HIM TO JUSTICE BUT THE FRENCHMEN DECLINED TO BE SATISFIED THEY HAD RECEIVED BUT VERY LITTLE MONEY AFTER THEY HAD PILLAGED A RICH TOWN AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THEIR ENGLISH COMPANIONS WERE INCLINED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IN EVERY WAY
THEIR VOYAGE WAS A VERY LONG ONE AND THEY WERE BESET BY CALMS AND INSTEAD OF REACHING NICARAGUA THEY DRIFTED INTO THE GULF OF HONDURAS HERE THEY FOUND THEMSELVES NEARLY OUT OF PROVISIONS
TELLING THEM NOT TO BE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO PAY THE RANSOM DEMANDED BY THE PIRATES BECAUSE HE WAS COMING WITH A STRONG FORCE TO THEIR ASSISTANCE WHEN MORGAN READ THESE LETTERS HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A WISE THING NOT TO STAY IN THAT REGION ANY LONGER THAN COULD BE HELPED
TO TEAR OUT HIS TONGUE WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND IT IS SAID THAT ON SOME OCCASIONS HIS FURY WAS SO GREAT THAT HE WOULD CUT OUT THE HEART OF A MAN AND BITE AT IT WITH HIS GREAT TEETH
OF THIS MONSTER IF IN HIS INFANCY HE HAD DIED OF CROUP
IN THE PLACES WHERE THESE MEN WERE ENLISTED THEY WERE TERMED SERVANTS BUT WHEN THEY GOT TO THE NEW WORLD THEY WERE GENERALLY CALLED SLAVES AND TREATED AS SUCH
HE DID SO WITH THE IDEA OF FOUNDING THERE A PERMANENT PIRATE PRINCIPALITY THE INHABITANTS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ENGLISH FRENCH OR DUTCH BUT PLAIN PIRATES HAVING A NATIONALITY AND COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN
AND ACCORDING TO THESE CURIOUS REGULATIONS THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF PLUNDER WAS APPORTIONED AMONG THE OFFICERS AND CREWS OF THE DIFFERENT SHIPS BEFORE THE REGULAR ALLOTMENT OF SHARES WAS MADE
FOR JOHN ESQUEMELING ACCOMPANIED IT AND SO FAR AS THE FAME AND REPUTATION OF THESE ADVENTURERS WAS CONCERNED HIS PEN WAS MIGHTIER THAN THEIR SWORDS FOR HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIS ACCOUNT OF THEIR DEEDS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE WORLD
THEY HAD HEARD OF L'OLONNOIS AND HIS BUCCANEERS AND WHEN THEY FOUND THIS NOTORIOUS PIRATE UPON THEIR SHORES
