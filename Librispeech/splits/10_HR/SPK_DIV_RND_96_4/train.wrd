AND THE SNOW HAD SO SETTLED UPON HIM THAT LUCY WHO HAPPENED TO SEE HIM AS HE ENTERED THE HALL SCREAMED OUT LAUGHINGLY
WELL I COULD NOT REST I WAS HALF MAD I SAY AND WENT ABOUT STILL TRYING IF I COULD NOT DISCOVER HIS NAME AND WHO HE WAS I DID COME UPON HIM BUT HE WAS WALKING QUICKLY ARM IN ARM WITH WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
VERY AGREEABLE MADAM I AM GLAD OF IT JOHN HAS CHARMING SPIRITS HAS NOT HE DID YOU MEET MISTER TILNEY MY DEAR SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WHERE IS HE
IN ONE OF THE COMFORTABLE SITTING ROOMS OF EAST LYNNE SAT MISTER CARLYLE AND HIS SISTER ONE INCLEMENT JANUARY NIGHT THE CONTRAST WITHIN AND WITHOUT WAS GREAT THE WARM BLAZING FIRE THE HANDSOME CARPET ON WHICH IT FLICKERED
TALKING TO A CAB DRIVER WHEN SOME DROPS OF RAIN CAME DOWN A GENTLEMAN AND LADY WERE PASSING AT THE TIME BUT I HAD NOT PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THEM BY JOVE I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM TO HER I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEPPER
LOCK THE DOOR SIR WERE HIS FIRST WORDS NEED YOU BE TOLD THAT IT WAS RICHARD HARE MISTER CARLYLE FASTENED THE WINDOW DREW THE HEAVY CURTAINS ACROSS AND TURNED RAPIDLY TO LOCK THE TWO DOORS
OH THERE'S NO MISTAKING HIS POSITION THAT HE MOVES IN THE HIGHER CLASSES THERE'S NO DOUBT THE CAB DROVE AWAY AND I GOT UP BEHIND IT THE DRIVER THOUGHT BOYS WERE THERE AND TURNED HIS HEAD AND HIS WHIP BUT I MADE HIM A SIGN
DOES CAPTAIN THORN LIVE HERE I ASKED HIM MISTER WESTLEBY LIVES HERE SAID HE I DON'T KNOW ANY CAPTAIN THORN
I'M SURE I HAVE BEEN FREE ENOUGH ALL MY LIFE FROM REQUIRING SUCH SICK DISHES DO SO SAID MISTER CARLYLE IT MAY DO YOU GOOD
MY DEAREST CREATURE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU THIS HOUR WHAT COULD INDUCE YOU TO COME INTO THIS SET
AS THEY HAD AGREED TO JOIN THEIR PARTY THIS WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE MISTER TILNEY STILL CONTINUING STANDING BEFORE THEM AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES CONSIDERATION HE ASKED CATHERINE TO DANCE WITH HIM THIS COMPLIMENT DELIGHTFUL AS IT WAS
THE TONES STRUCK FAMILIARLY ON MISTER CARLYLE'S EAR HE DREW BACK MECHANICALLY A THOUSAND PERPLEXING SENSATIONS OVERWHELMING HIM AND THE MAN FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE ROOM A WHITE MAN AS LUCY CALLED HER FATHER
OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO POINT OUT THE DISCREPANCY AND TO INQUIRE HOW SHE COULD RECONCILE IT YET HER ASSERTION TO HIM HAD BEEN MOST POSITIVE AND SOLEMN THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE MATTER WHICH HE COULD NOT RECONCILE
TO A PLEASANTER FEELING BY SEEING NOT MISTER THORPE BUT MISTER TILNEY WITHIN THREE YARDS OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY SAT HE SEEMED TO BE MOVING THAT WAY BUT HE DID NOT SEE HER AND THEREFORE THE SMILE AND THE BLUSH
RICHARD UTTERED MISTER CARLYLE I AM THUNDERSTRUCK
AND GRUNTING AND SNIFFLING AND CHOKING MISS CARLYLE WAS ONE OF YOUR STRONG MINDED LADIES WHO NEVER CONDESCENDED TO BE ILL OF COURSE HAD SHE BEEN ATTACKED WITH SCARLET FEVER OR PARALYSIS OR SAINT VITUS DANCE
SET ON BY THAT WRETCH THORN MISTER CARLYLE TURNED TO THE SIDEBOARD AND POURED OUT A WINEGLASS OF BRANDY DRINK IT RICHARD IT WILL WARM YOU I'D RATHER HAVE IT IN SOME HOT WATER SIR
WHISPERED CATHERINE DETACHING HER FRIEND FROM JAMES IT IS MISTER TILNEY'S SISTER
BUT SHE HAD NOT LOOKED ROUND LONG BEFORE SHE SAW HIM LEADING A YOUNG LADY TO THE DANCE AH HE HAS GOT A PARTNER I WISH HE HAD ASKED YOU SAID MISSUS ALLEN AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE SHE ADDED
HE MAY HAVE BROUGHT HALF A DOZEN MORE WITH HIM GASPED THE UNHAPPY RICHARD I SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE DODGED ME ALL THE WAY HERE NONSENSE SIT YOU DOWN AND BE AT REST IT IS ONLY CORNELIA
NOW THAT I HAVE GOT OVER MY PASSION FOR AFY I CAN SEE HER FAULTS MISTER CARLYLE SHE'D NO MORE TELL AN UNTRUTH THAN I SHOULD STICK A MOST AWFUL THUNDERING AT THE ROOM DOOR
I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
I DON'T POSSESS A PENNY PIECE HE ADDED DRAWING OUT HIS TROUSERS POCKETS FOR THE INSPECTION OF MISTER CARLYLE THE LAST COPPERS I HAD THREE PENCE I SPENT IN BREAD AND CHEESE AND HALF A PINT OF BEER AT MIDDAY
PERHAPS HE HAS SONS I ASKED NOT ANY THE MAN ANSWERED THERE'S NOBODY BUT THEIR TWO SELVES
SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING VEXED AT THE NON APPEARANCE OF MISTER THORPE FOR SHE NOT ONLY LONGED TO BE DANCING BUT WAS LIKEWISE AWARE THAT AS THE REAL DIGNITY OF HER SITUATION COULD NOT BE KNOWN
ALL I WISH IT HAD BEEN ALL I KEPT LOOKING ABOUT FOR HIM IN ALL THE BEST STREETS I WAS HALF MAD DO YOU NOT WONDER IF HE IS IN THIS POSITION OF LIFE AND RESIDES IN LONDON
I BOLTED UNDER THE HORSES OF A PASSING VEHICLE DOWN SOME TURNINGS AND PASSAGES OUT INTO ANOTHER STREET AND UP BESIDE A CABMAN WHO WAS ON HIS BOX DRIVING A FARE PAST I REACHED MY LODGINGS IN SAFETY AS I THOUGHT
AND I WISHED TO KNOW HIS NAME WELL MISTER CARLYLE I COULD GET AT NOTHING SATISFACTORY THE FELLOW SAID THAT A GREAT MANY HAD CALLED THERE THAT DAY FOR HIS MASTER WAS JUST UP FROM A LONG ILLNESS AND PEOPLE CAME TO SEE HIM IS THAT ALL RICHARD
AND REMEMBER MEN ARE NOT GIVEN INTO CUSTODY FOR WATCHING OTHERS HE SIGNIFICANTLY ADDED I KNOW YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY REGARD FOR YOURSELF YOU'LL KEEP OUT OF MY WAY
BUT MOUSQUETON FORAGES AND BRINGS IN PROVISIONS FRIEND MOUSQUETON YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE A REINFORCEMENT AND WE MUST HAVE AN INCREASE OF SUPPLIES MOUSQUETON SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU MUST RENDER ME A SERVICE WHAT MONSIEUR
THAT WHEN HE SAW A HUGUENOT COMING HE FELT HIMSELF FILLED WITH SUCH ARDENT CATHOLIC ZEAL
I CANNOT TELL YOU MONSIEUR WHAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME SURELY YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PERSON YES BUT IN OUR SITUATION WE MUST NOT SAY ALL WE KNOW PARTICULARLY AS WE HAVE BEEN WARNED THAT OUR EARS SHOULD ANSWER FOR OUR TONGUES
AND WHO BOTH KNEW HIM AGAIN SO THEY UNITED AGAINST HIM AND HANGED HIM ON A TREE
AND COMMENCED THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION MY FAITH MY GOOD HOST SAID D'ARTAGNAN FILLING THE TWO GLASSES
A MAN IS NOT PRIVILEGED IN ALL WAYS SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU KNOW THE PROVERB UNLUCKY AT PLAY LUCKY IN LOVE
THE STRANGER PLACED THE POINT OF HIS SWORD AT HIS THROAT AND MONSIEUR PORTHOS FINDING HIMSELF AT THE MERCY OF HIS ADVERSARY ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF CONQUERED
AND I ON THAT OF THE HUGUENOT TWO HOURS AFTER ALL WAS OVER WE HAD DONE THE BUSINESS OF BOTH ADMIRING THE FORESIGHT OF OUR POOR FATHER WHO HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION TO BRING EACH OF US UP IN A DIFFERENT RELIGION WELL
WILLINGLY SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHILE PORTHOS AND MOUSQUETON WERE BREAKFASTING WITH THE APPETITES OF CONVALESCENTS AND WITH THAT BROTHERLY CORDIALITY WHICH UNITES MEN IN MISFORTUNE D'ARTAGNAN RELATED HOW ARAMIS BEING WOUNDED WAS OBLIGED TO STOP AT CREVECOEUR
AS THOUGH AWAKENING FROM A SLEEP TO THE REALITIES OF LIFE DID YOU SAY A MISFORTUNE INDEED I SHOULD EXPECT MISFORTUNES
THE FALSEHOOD WOULD THEN LIE AT MY DOOR AND AS I AM NOT A GENTLEMAN I MAY BE ALLOWED TO LIE
ALL LIGHT WHOLESOME FOOD SUITABLE FOR THE SICK BUT THE WINE SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO FURNISHES THE WINE YOUR HOST THAT IS TO SAY YES AND NO HOW YES AND NO
DON'T LISTEN TO THOSE WHO PROMISE YOU WEALTH OVERNIGHT MY BOY AS A RULE THEY ARE EITHER FOOLS OR SWINDLERS LISTEN TO ME AND GO HOME
WHEREAS THE STRANGER ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF ALL HIS RODOMONTADES QUICKLY THREW HIM ON HIS BACK AS MONSIEUR PORTHOS IS A VERY BOASTFUL MAN HE INSISTS THAT NOBODY SHALL KNOW HE HAS RECEIVED THIS WOUND EXCEPT THE DUCHESS
DRESSED WITH A DOZEN YOUNG AND TENDER SPRING CHICKENS AFTER THE HARE HE ORDERED SOME PARTRIDGES A FEW PHEASANTS A COUPLE OF RABBITS AND A DOZEN FROGS AND LIZARDS THAT WAS ALL HE FELT ILL HE SAID AND COULD NOT EAT ANOTHER BITE
WHEN WAR CAME AND CARRIED ME AWAY I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME WELL ENOUGH TO WAIT FOR ME AND EVEN TO REMAIN FAITHFUL TO MY MEMORY WHEN I RETURNED SHE WAS MARRIED THIS IS THE HISTORY OF MOST MEN WHO HAVE PASSED TWENTY YEARS OF AGE
SHE EXCLAIMED IN SO PLAINTIVE AN ACCENT THAT IT SEEMED TO STIFLE A SOB REALLY YOU PAIN ME A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED THE PEACH LIKE THE GRAPES FELL TO THE GROUND COUNT ADDED MERCEDES WITH A SUPPLICATING GLANCE
EXACTLY SO SAID THE HOST I REMEMBER IT PERFECTLY IT IS NOT MONSIEUR PORTHOS THAT YOUR LORDSHIP MEANS YES THAT IS MY COMPANION'S NAME MY GOD MY DEAR HOST TELL ME IF ANYTHING HAS HAPPENED TO HIM
REMEMBER THAT BOYS WHO INSIST ON HAVING THEIR OWN WAY SOONER OR LATER COME TO GRIEF THE SAME NONSENSE GOOD BY CRICKET GOOD NIGHT PINOCCHIO AND MAY HEAVEN PRESERVE YOU FROM THE ASSASSINS THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MINUTE
BUT YOU ARE HERE MY DEAR FELLOW LET US SPEAK OF YOU I CONFESS I BEGAN TO BE VERY UNEASY ON YOUR ACCOUNT BUT YOUR HOST BEHAVES VERY WELL TOWARD YOU AS IT APPEARS MY DEAR PORTHOS
ALL FALSEHOOD IS A MASK AND HOWEVER WELL MADE THE MASK MAY BE WITH A LITTLE ATTENTION WE MAY ALWAYS SUCCEED IN DISTINGUISHING IT FROM THE TRUE FACE
NOW I TRAVEL A GREAT DEAL PARTICULARLY ON THIS ROAD AND I WISH TO SEE ALL INNKEEPERS MAKING A FORTUNE IT SEEMS TO ME SAID THE HOST THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF SEEING MONSIEUR BAH I HAVE PASSED PERHAPS TEN TIMES THROUGH CHANTILLY
MONTE CRISTO REMAINED AS UNMOVED AS IF THE REPROACH HAD NOT BEEN ADDRESSED TO HIM ALBERT AT THIS MOMENT RAN IN OH MOTHER HE EXCLAIMED SUCH A MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED WHAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED ASKED THE COUNTESS
A MAGNIFICENT PEACH WAS HANGING AGAINST AN ADJOINING WALL RIPENED BY THE SAME ARTIFICIAL HEAT MERCEDES DREW NEAR AND PLUCKED THE FRUIT TAKE THIS PEACH THEN SHE SAID THE COUNT AGAIN REFUSED WHAT AGAIN
PINOCCHIO ATE LEAST OF ALL HE ASKED FOR A BITE OF BREAD AND A FEW NUTS AND THEN HARDLY TOUCHED THEM THE POOR FELLOW WITH HIS MIND ON THE FIELD OF WONDERS WAS SUFFERING FROM A GOLD PIECE INDIGESTION
WHO ALTHOUGH SHE IS AT LEAST FIFTY STILL GIVES HERSELF JEALOUS AIRS
AND DESIRED THE HOST TO BRING HIM A BOTTLE OF HIS BEST WINE AND AS GOOD A BREAKFAST AS POSSIBLE A DESIRE WHICH FURTHER CORROBORATED THE HIGH OPINION THE INNKEEPER HAD FORMED OF THE TRAVELER AT FIRST SIGHT
YOU SAID THAT PORTHOS HAD RECEIVED A SWORD CUT YES BUT HE HAS FORBIDDEN ME SO STRICTLY TO SAY SO AND WHY SO ZOUNDS MONSIEUR BECAUSE HE HAD BOASTED THAT HE WOULD PERFORATE THE STRANGER WITH WHOM YOU LEFT HIM IN DISPUTE
THE HOST ON SEEING A YOUNG MAN FOLLOWED BY A LACKEY WITH TWO EXTRA HORSES ADVANCED RESPECTFULLY TO THE DOOR NOW AS THEY HAD ALREADY TRAVELED ELEVEN LEAGUES D'ARTAGNAN THOUGHT IT TIME TO STOP
SO SO REPLIED PORTHOS ONLY THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO THE IMPERTINENT JACKANAPES GAVE ME HIS BILL AND I WAS FORCED TO TURN BOTH HIM AND HIS BILL OUT OF THE DOOR SO THAT I AM HERE
AH MONSIEUR YOU INFUSE GENUINE BALM INTO MY BLOOD WE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES AND THIS VERY MORNING THE SURGEON DECLARED THAT IF MONSIEUR PORTHOS DID NOT PAY HIM HE SHOULD LOOK TO ME AS IT WAS I WHO HAD SENT FOR HIM PORTHOS IS WOUNDED THEN
AND YET SAID D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING IT APPEARS TO ME THAT FROM TIME TO TIME YOU MUST MAKE SORTIES AND HE AGAIN POINTED TO THE BOTTLES AND THE STEWPANS NOT I UNFORTUNATELY SAID PORTHOS THIS MISERABLE STRAIN CONFINES ME TO MY BED
AND SHINE IN ONE PART MORE AND IN ANOTHER LESS WITHIN THAT HEAVEN WHICH MOST HIS LIGHT RECEIVES WAS I
THEREAFTER ANSWERED ME SO FULL OF GLADNESS SHE SEEMED TO BURN IN THE FIRST FIRE OF LOVE BROTHER OUR WILL IS QUIETED BY VIRTUE OF CHARITY
BECAUSE THEY CORUSCATE WHEN THOU DOST SMILE BUT KNOW NOT WHO THOU ART NOR WHY THOU HAST SPIRIT AUGUST THY STATION IN THE SPHERE THAT VEILS ITSELF TO MEN IN ALIEN RAYS
IS FOLLOWED BY GREAT FLAME PERCHANCE WITH BETTER VOICES AFTER ME SHALL PRAYER BE MADE THAT CYRRHA MAY RESPOND TO MORTAL MEN BY PASSAGES DIVERSE UPRISES THE WORLD'S LAMP
THEREFORE IS GIVEN US BECAUSE OUR VOWS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND IN SOME PART VOID WHENCE I TO HER IN YOUR MIRACULOUS ASPECTS THERE SHINES I KNOW NOT WHAT OF THE DIVINE
THIS OTHER SPLENDOUR WHICH TO THEE REVEALS ITSELF ON MY RIGHT SIDE AND IS ENKINDLED WITH ALL THE ILLUMINATION OF OUR SPHERE WHAT OF MYSELF I SAY APPLIES TO HER
TASTING OF THE HERB THAT MADE HIM PEER OF THE OTHER GODS BENEATH THE SEA TO REPRESENT TRANSHUMANISE IN WORDS IMPOSSIBLE WERE THE EXAMPLE THEN
IF ONE FOOD SATES AND FOR ANOTHER STILL REMAINS THE LONGING WE ASK FOR THIS AND THAT DECLINE WITH THANKS E'EN THUS DID I WITH GESTURE AND WITH WORD
SINCE FROM ABOVE THEY TAKE AND ACT BENEATH OBSERVE ME WELL HOW THROUGH THIS PLACE I COME UNTO THE TRUTH THOU WISHEST THAT HEREAFTER THOU MAYST ALONE KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE FORD
OF THE HEART'S VEIL SHE NEVER WAS DIVESTED OF GREAT COSTANZA THIS IS THE EFFULGENCE
NE'ER RAN AS THOU WHO THITHERWARD RETURNEST IF OF MY FORMER DOUBT I WAS DIVESTED BY THESE BRIEF LITTLE WORDS MORE SMILED THAN SPOKEN I IN A NEW ONE WAS THE MORE ENSNARED AND SAID
AND IF IT CHANCE THE OTHER I DEMOLISH THEN FALSIFIED WILL THY OPINION BE BUT IF THIS RARITY GO NOT THROUGH AND THROUGH THERE NEEDS MUST BE A LIMIT
TOWARDS ME TURNING BLITHE AS BEAUTIFUL SAID UNTO ME FIX GRATEFULLY THY MIND ON GOD WHO UNTO THE FIRST STAR HAS BROUGHT US
BUT NOW ANOTHER PASSAGE RUNS ACROSS BEFORE THINE EYES AND SUCH THAT BY THYSELF THOU COULDST NOT THREAD IT ERE THOU WOULDST BE WEARY I HAVE FOR CERTAIN PUT INTO THY MIND THAT SOUL BEATIFIED COULD NEVER LIE
AS GIVING THE BELOVED LAUREL ASKS ONE SUMMIT OF PARNASSUS HITHERTO HAS BEEN ENOUGH FOR ME BUT NOW WITH BOTH I NEEDS MUST ENTER THE ARENA LEFT ENTER INTO MY BOSOM THOU
AND IF SOME OTHER THING YOUR LOVE SEDUCE TIS NOTHING BUT A VESTIGE OF THE SAME ILL UNDERSTOOD WHICH THERE IS SHINING THROUGH THOU FAIN WOULDST KNOW
MUST BE PERFORCE THE FRUITS OF FORMAL PRINCIPLES AND THESE SAVE ONE OF COURSE WOULD BY THY REASONING BE DESTROYED BESIDES IF RARITY WERE OF THIS DIMNESS THE CAUSE THOU ASKEST
AND IN SUCH SPACE PERCHANCE AS STRIKES A BOLT AND FLIES AND FROM THE NOTCH UNLOCKS ITSELF
NOR OF EXISTENCE MORE OR FEWER YEARS BUT ALL MAKE BEAUTIFUL THE PRIMAL CIRCLE AND HAVE SWEET LIFE IN DIFFERENT DEGREES BY FEELING MORE OR LESS THE ETERNAL BREATH THEY SHOWED THEMSELVES HERE
WHO FROM ABOVE DESCENDS BECAUSE IN DRAWING NEAR TO ITS DESIRE OUR INTELLECT INGULPHS ITSELF SO FAR THAT AFTER IT THE MEMORY CANNOT GO TRULY
BE FAITHFUL AND NOT BLIND IN DOING THAT AS JEPHTHAH WAS IN HIS FIRST OFFERING WHOM MORE BESEEMED TO SAY I HAVE DONE WRONG THAN TO DO WORSE BY KEEPING
OR EVER YET THE WARFARE BE ABANDONED WITH LIGHT THAT THROUGH THE WHOLE OF HEAVEN IS SPREAD KINDLED ARE WE AND HENCE IF THOU DESIREST TO KNOW OF US AT THINE OWN PLEASURE SATE THEE
AND AS FOOLISH THOU THE GREAT LEADER OF THE GREEKS WILT FIND WHENCE WEPT IPHIGENIA HER FAIR FACE AND MADE FOR HER BOTH WISE AND SIMPLE WEEP
WHAT BECAME I WHO BY MY NATURE AM EXCEEDING MUTABLE IN EVERY GUISE AS IN A FISH POND WHICH IS PURE AND TRANQUIL THE FISHES DRAW TO THAT WHICH FROM WITHOUT COMES IN SUCH FASHION THAT THEIR FOOD THEY DEEM IT
LISTEN AND BELIEVE FOR THE TRUE LIGHT WHICH GIVETH PEACE TO THEM PERMITS THEM NOT TO TURN FROM IT THEIR FEET AND I UNTO THE SHADE THAT SEEMED MOST WISHFUL TO SPEAK DIRECTED ME AND I BEGAN
AND WE HERE CONCEIVE NOT HOW ONE DIMENSION TOLERATES ANOTHER WHICH NEEDS MUST BE IF BODY ENTER BODY MORE THE DESIRE SHOULD BE ENKINDLED IN US THAT ESSENCE TO BEHOLD WHEREIN IS SEEN HOW GOD AND OUR OWN NATURE WERE UNITED
AND TEMPTING A FREE MAN WOULD DIE OF HUNGER ERE EITHER HE COULD BRING UNTO HIS TEETH SO WOULD A LAMB BETWEEN THE RAVENINGS OF TWO FIERCE WOLVES STAND FEARING BOTH ALIKE
THE HAVING HEARD WITHOUT RETAINING IT IN THE ESSENCE OF THIS SACRIFICE TWO THINGS CONVENE TOGETHER AND THE ONE IS THAT OF WHICH TIS MADE THE OTHER IS THE AGREEMENT THIS LAST FOR EVERMORE IS CANCELLED NOT
THEY CLUNG TO THE PURPLE MOORS BEHIND AND AROUND THEIR DWELLING TO THE HOLLOW VALE INTO WHICH THE PEBBLY BRIDLE PATH LEADING FROM THEIR GATE DESCENDED AND WHICH WOUND BETWEEN FERN BANKS FIRST AND THEN AMONGST A FEW OF THE WILDEST LITTLE PASTURE FIELDS
BUT THE FIRST GUSH OF VIVACITY AND FLUENCY GONE I WAS FAIN TO SIT ON A STOOL AT DIANA'S FEET TO REST MY HEAD ON HER KNEE AND LISTEN ALTERNATELY TO HER AND MARY WHILE THEY SOUNDED THOROUGHLY THE TOPIC ON WHICH I HAD BUT TOUCHED
AND THERE HE SAW TOM SITTING ON A BENCH AND BLOWING ON A WHISTLE MADE FROM A PIG'S TAIL WHERE DID YOU GET THAT TAIL ASKED THE FARMER I FOUND IT SAID NAUGHTY TOM BEGINNING TO BE FRIGHTENED LET ME SEE IT DEMANDED THE FARMER
DEVELOPED FOR ME IN THESE REGIONS THE SAME ATTRACTION AS FOR THEM WOUND ROUND MY FACULTIES THE SAME SPELL THAT ENTRANCED THEIRS INDOORS WE AGREED EQUALLY WELL
WHEN TOM SHOWED BY HIS ACTIONS HIS INTENTION OF BEING HONEST HE SOON GOT A JOB OF WORK TO DO AND BEFORE LONG HE WAS ABLE TO EARN A LIVING MORE EASILY AND A GREAT DEAL MORE HONESTLY
OH NO SINCE IT IS AN EMPLOYMENT WHICH DEPENDS ONLY ON ME TO GIVE AND YOU TO ACCEPT
I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIM NOR OF HIS REINDEER AND IT IS SUCH FUN TO SEE HIM COME DASHING ALONG CRACKING HIS WHIP AND CALLING OUT CHEERILY TO HIS REINDEER WHO ARE ABLE TO RUN EVEN SWIFTER THAN WE RABBITS
SO HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND BUCKLED A STRAP AROUND HIS WAIST AND WENT DOWN TO THE VILLAGE TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND OUT WHO HAD STOLEN HIS PIG UP AND DOWN THE STREET HE WENT AND IN AND OUT THE LANES
THE NEXT CHRISTMAS WHEN I WATCHED BY THE ROAD SIDE TO SEE SANTA I WAS PLEASED TO NOTICE A GREAT MANY OF THE TOY RABBITS STICKING OUT OF THE LOADED SLEIGH THE BABIES MUST HAVE LIKED THEM TOO FOR EVERY YEAR SINCE I HAVE SEEN THEM AMONGST THE TOYS
I WAITED A FEW MOMENTS EXPECTING HE WOULD GO ON WITH THE SUBJECT FIRST BROACHED BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE ENTERED ANOTHER TRAIN OF REFLECTION HIS LOOK DENOTED ABSTRACTION FROM ME AND MY BUSINESS
AND WHEN HE HAD LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY HE CRIED OUT THIS TAIL BELONGED TO MY LITTLE PIG FOR I KNOW VERY WELL THE CURL AT THE END OF IT TELL ME YOU RASCAL WHERE IS THE PIG THEN TOM FELL IN A TREMBLE FOR HE KNEW HIS WICKEDNESS WAS DISCOVERED
BUT HE WAS SO SLY AND CAUTIOUS THAT NO ONE HAD EVER CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT OF STEALING ALTHOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS HAD BEEN MISSED AFTER THEY HAD FALLEN INTO THE OLD MAN'S WAY BARNEY HAD ONE SON NAMED TOM
AND THEY LIVED ALL ALONE IN A LITTLE HUT AWAY AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE STREET FOR TOM'S MOTHER HAD DIED WHEN HE WAS A BABY YOU MAY NOT SUPPOSE THAT TOM WAS A VERY GOOD BOY SINCE HE HAD SUCH A QUEER FATHER BUT NEITHER WAS HE VERY BAD
SO AFTER MOTHER HUBBARD HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD MEAL OF TURNIPS AND SLICED CABBAGE SANTA CLAUS PUT THE MAGIC COLLAR AROUND MY NECK AND I STARTED FOR HOME I TOOK MY TIME ON THE JOURNEY FOR I KNEW NOTHING COULD HARM ME
AND BEING THE ONLY CHILD UPON THE FARM SHE WAS ALLOWED TO ROAM ABOUT THE MEADOWS AND WOODS AS SHE PLEASED ON THE BRIGHT SUMMER MORNINGS DOROTHY'S MOTHER WOULD TIE A SUN BONNET UNDER THE GIRL'S CHIN
CAME THE STRAP OVER TOM'S BACK OW OW CRIED THE BOY AND STARTED TO RUN DOWN THE STREET WHACK WHACK FELL THE STRAP OVER HIS SHOULDER FOR THE FARMER FOLLOWED AT HIS HEELS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET
MARY WOULD SIT AND WATCH ME BY THE HOUR TOGETHER THEN SHE WOULD TAKE LESSONS AND A DOCILE INTELLIGENT ASSIDUOUS PUPIL SHE MADE THUS OCCUPIED AND MUTUALLY ENTERTAINED DAYS PASSED LIKE HOURS AND WEEKS LIKE DAYS
DID NOT EXTEND TO HIM ONE REASON OF THE DISTANCE YET OBSERVED BETWEEN US WAS THAT HE WAS COMPARATIVELY SELDOM AT HOME A LARGE PROPORTION OF HIS TIME APPEARED DEVOTED TO VISITING THE SICK AND POOR AMONG THE SCATTERED POPULATION OF HIS PARISH
AND DID NOT LIKE TO CRUSH THE PRETTY FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN HER PATH AND SHE WAS ALSO VERY FOND OF ALL THE ANIMALS AND LEARNED TO KNOW THEM WELL AND EVEN TO UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN DO AND THE ANIMALS LOVED DOROTHY IN TURN
BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE WINTER IN WINTER WE RABBITS SAID BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY AND DO YOU EVER SEE HIM ASKED THE GIRL EAGERLY OH YES EVERY WINTER
SAY WHAT DO YOU SEE WITH YOUR BIG ROUND EYE ON CHRISTMAS WE RABBITS SAYS BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY LITTLE DOROTHY HAD PASSED ALL THE FEW YEARS OF HER LIFE IN THE COUNTRY
STERN ALLUSIONS TO CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ELECTION PREDESTINATION REPROBATION WERE FREQUENT AND EACH REFERENCE TO THESE POINTS SOUNDED LIKE A SENTENCE PRONOUNCED FOR DOOM
TOM THE PIPER'S SON
REGRETS TO WHICH I HAVE LATTERLY AVOIDED REFERRING BUT WHICH POSSESSED ME AND TYRANNISED OVER ME RUTHLESSLY MEANTIME A MONTH WAS GONE
AFTER THIS SAID SANTA CLAUS I CAN MAKE RABBITS WITHOUT HAVING YOU FOR A PATTERN BUT IF YOU LIKE YOU MAY STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER IN MY CASTLE AND AMUSE YOURSELF I THANKED HIM AND DECIDED TO STAY
FINALLY DOROTHY VENTURED TO SPEAK SO SHE ASKED VERY SOFTLY AND SLOWLY OH LITTLE BUN RABBIT SO SOFT AND SO SHY SAY WHAT DO YOU SEE WITH YOUR BIG ROUND EYE MANY THINGS ANSWERED THE RABBIT
THE PIPER AND HIS SON HAD A FINE DINNER THAT DAY AND SO GREAT WAS THEIR HUNGER THAT THE LITTLE PIG WAS ALL EATEN UP AT ONE MEAL THEN BARNEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP AND TOM SAT ON A BENCH OUTSIDE THE DOOR
AND HER CUPBOARD IS NEVER BARE NOW I CAN PROMISE YOU AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE THERE IS ONE BIG ROOM AND THAT IS SANTA'S WORK SHOP WHERE HE MAKES THE TOYS ON ONE SIDE IS HIS WORK BENCH WITH PLENTY OF SAWS AND HAMMERS AND JACK KNIVES
AND AID THEM WHEN AND WHERE THEY WOULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A REVIVING PLEASURE IN THIS INTERCOURSE OF A KIND NOW TASTED BY ME FOR THE FIRST TIME
WILL BE INFLUENCED AND MATERIALLY INFLUENCED BY THE MERE SILENT PRESENCE OF SOME EXTERNAL OBJECT WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN NEAR US WHEN WE CLOSED OUR EYES AND OF WHOSE VICINITY WE HAVE HAD NO WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS
THEY PURPOSED REMAINING IN LONDON ONLY THREE DAYS PRIOR TO DEPARTING FOR SOME WEEKS TO A DISTANT PART OF THE COAST IT WAS NOW MIDNIGHT OF THE FIRST DAY WHAT COURSE OF ACTION COULD SHE DETERMINE UPON WHICH COULD BE ADOPTED IN EIGHT AND FORTY HOURS
SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RATHER TESTILY WELL THAT I DO SIR REPLIED THE OLD LADY PEOPLE'S EYES AT MY TIME OF LIFE DON'T IMPROVE WITH AGE SIR I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW
OLIVER COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT THE WITHERED FLOWERS WERE NEVER THROWN AWAY ALTHOUGH THE LITTLE VASE WAS REGULARLY REPLENISHED NOR COULD HE HELP OBSERVING THAT WHENEVER THE DOCTOR CAME INTO THE GARDEN HE INVARIABLY CAST HIS EYES UP TO THAT PARTICULAR CORNER
MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN IMPATIENTLY HE WOULD BE A SELFISH BRUTE UNWORTHY ALIKE OF THE NAME OF MAN AND OF THE WOMAN YOU DESCRIBE WHO ACTED THUS YOU THINK SO NOW HARRY REPLIED HIS MOTHER AND EVER WILL SAID THE YOUNG MAN
AND WERE WITHAL AS ORIGINAL AND AS MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AS THE REMARKS OF GREAT MEN COMMONLY ARE ABOVE STAIRS THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY FOR THE DOCTOR WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND HOWEVER FATIGUED OR THOUGHTFUL HARRY MAYLIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT FIRST
RESERVING NANCY'S INFORMATION FOR THAT GENTLEMAN'S PRIVATE EAR AND CONCLUDING WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HIS ONLY SORROW FOR SOME MONTHS PAST HAD BEEN NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET WITH HIS FORMER BENEFACTOR AND FRIEND THANK GOD SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN
DON'T BE AFRAID I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR GRANDFATHER YOU'RE A SWEET GIRL I LIKE YOU HERE THEY ARE IN FACT AS HE THREW HIMSELF AT ONE DEXTEROUS DIVE INTO HIS FORMER SEAT MISTER BROWNLOW RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY OLIVER
BUT WHAT IS THIS OF WHOM DO YOU SPEAK I HAVE SEEN THE GENTLEMAN REPLIED OLIVER SCARCELY ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS SO GOOD TO ME MISTER BROWNLOW THAT WE HAVE SO OFTEN TALKED ABOUT WHERE ASKED ROSE
HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE STEPS OF THE CHAISE SUPPORTING AN ELBOW ON EACH KNEE AND WIPING HIS EYES WITH A BLUE COTTON POCKET HANDKERCHIEF DOTTED WITH WHITE SPOTS THAT THE HONEST FELLOW HAD NOT BEEN FEIGNING EMOTION
AND SENDING UP HER CARD BY THE SERVANT REQUESTED TO SEE MISTER BROWNLOW ON VERY PRESSING BUSINESS THE SERVANT SOON RETURNED TO BEG THAT SHE WOULD WALK UPSTAIRS AND FOLLOWING HIM INTO AN UPPER ROOM MISS MAYLIE WAS PRESENTED TO AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN OF BENEVOLENT APPEARANCE
THE TEARS ROSE TO HER EYES AS SHE PURSUED THIS TRAIN OF REFLECTION HE MIGHT HAVE BY THIS TIME LEARNT TO FORGET HER AND TO BE HAPPIER AWAY DISTURBED BY THESE DIFFERENT REFLECTIONS INCLINING NOW TO ONE COURSE AND THEN TO ANOTHER
IF IT BE PAINFUL TO HIM SHE THOUGHT TO COME BACK HERE HOW PAINFUL IT WILL BE TO ME BUT PERHAPS HE WILL NOT COME HE MAY WRITE OR HE MAY COME HIMSELF AND STUDIOUSLY ABSTAIN FROM MEETING ME HE DID WHEN HE WENT AWAY
AND LAID IT DOWN AGAIN FIFTY TIMES AND HAD CONSIDERED AND RECONSIDERED THE FIRST LINE OF HER LETTER WITHOUT WRITING THE FIRST WORD WHEN OLIVER WHO HAD BEEN WALKING IN THE STREETS WITH MISTER GILES FOR A BODY GUARD ENTERED THE ROOM IN SUCH BREATHLESS HASTE AND VIOLENT AGITATION
A BURST OF TEARS CAME TO HIS RELIEF AND HE SEEMED TO AWAKEN ALL AT ONCE TO A FULL SENSE OF THE JOYFUL CHANGE THAT HAD OCCURRED AND THE ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE LOAD OF ANGUISH WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIS BREAST THE NIGHT WAS FAST CLOSING IN WHEN HE RETURNED HOMEWARD
THE MELANCHOLY WHICH HAD SEEMED TO THE SAD EYES OF THE ANXIOUS BOY TO HANG FOR DAYS PAST OVER EVERY OBJECT BEAUTIFUL AS ALL WERE WAS DISPELLED BY MAGIC THE DEW SEEMED TO SPARKLE MORE BRIGHTLY ON THE GREEN LEAVES THE AIR TO RUSTLE AMONG THEM WITH A SWEETER MUSIC
RUNNING UP TO THE CHAISE DOOR GILES POPPED OUT HIS NIGHTCAP AGAIN PREPARATORY TO MAKING SOME REPLY WHEN HE WAS SUDDENLY PULLED BACK BY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO OCCUPIED THE OTHER CORNER OF THE CHAISE AND WHO EAGERLY DEMANDED WHAT WAS THE NEWS
I SHALL SURPRISE YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID ROSE NATURALLY EMBARRASSED BUT YOU ONCE SHOWED GREAT BENEVOLENCE AND GOODNESS TO A VERY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND OF MINE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL TAKE AN INTEREST IN HEARING OF HIM AGAIN
THAT YOUTH HAS MANY GENEROUS IMPULSES WHICH DO NOT LAST AND THAT AMONG THEM ARE SOME WHICH BEING GRATIFIED BECOME ONLY THE MORE FLEETING ABOVE ALL I THINK SAID THE LADY FIXING HER EYES ON HER SON'S FACE THAT IF AN ENTHUSIASTIC
AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES LIKE MISFORTUNES SELDOM COME ALONE HER SITUATION WAS INDEED ONE OF NO COMMON TRIAL AND DIFFICULTY
DO YOU STILL SUPPOSE THAT I AM A BOY IGNORANT OF MY OWN MIND AND MISTAKING THE IMPULSES OF MY OWN SOUL I THINK MY DEAR SON RETURNED MISSUS MAYLIE LAYING HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RINGING THE BELL SEND MISSUS BEDWIN HERE IF YOU PLEASE THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH ALL DISPATCH AND DROPPING A CURTSEY AT THE DOOR WAITED FOR ORDERS WHY YOU GET BLINDER EVERY DAY BEDWIN
AND AFTERWARDS SHOOK HANDS ACCORDING TO THEIR INVARIABLE CUSTOM NOW MISS MAYLIE SAID MISTER BROWNLOW TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT IN WHICH YOUR HUMANITY IS SO MUCH INTERESTED
AND READILY UNDERTOOK TO HOLD SOLEMN CONFERENCE WITH THE WORTHY DOCTOR HIMSELF TO AFFORD HIM AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THIS DESIGN IT WAS ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD CALL AT THE HOTEL AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT EVENING AND THAT IN THE MEANTIME
YET LEFT HER CHAMBER AND THERE WERE NO EVENING WALKS SAVE NOW AND THEN FOR A SHORT DISTANCE WITH MISSUS MAYLIE HE APPLIED HIMSELF WITH REDOUBLED ASSIDUITY TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE WHITE HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN AND LABOURED SO HARD THAT HIS QUICK PROGRESS SURPRISED EVEN HIMSELF
AND THAT YOUR ARRIVAL HERE A DAY SOONER OR A DAY LATER
HE IS COGNIZANT OF THE BUSINESS ON WHICH I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU MISTER BROWNLOW INCLINED HIS HEAD MISTER GRIMWIG WHO HAD MADE ONE VERY STIFF BOW AND RISEN FROM HIS CHAIR MADE ANOTHER VERY STIFF BOW AND DROPPED INTO IT AGAIN

MONEY SOCIETY'S VINDICATION OF VULGARITY MONOPOLY A MODERN DEVICE FOR IMPOVERISHING OTHERS
BOTH HALVES ARE EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL MEAL
THE PEOPLE A SWIFT KICK FOR THE PEOPLE MOON THE ONLY LIGHTING MONOPOLY THAT NEVER MADE MONEY MORTGAGE
ZEBRA THE CROOK AMONG HORSES CONDEMNED TO WEAR STRIPES FOR LIFE ZERO ORIGINALLY NOTHING BUT NOW MEANING A GOOD DEAL ON A THERMOMETER OR BANK DRAFT AND COMPRISING TWO THIRDS OF THE FOUR HUNDRED
AN ALLEGED MUSICAL INSTRUMENT POPULAR AT HOME BUT UNPOPULAR NEXT DOOR
THE GRAMINIVORA CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE SUBSTANCES THEIR FOOD MUST CONTAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ONE OR MORE OF THEM AND IF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE NOT SUPPLIED DEATH QUICKLY ENSUES
OUT OF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE ADAPTED TO THE FORMATION OF BLOOD ARE FORMED ALL THE ORGANISED TISSUES THE OTHER CLASS OF SUBSTANCES IN THE NORMAL STATE OF HEALTH
MORE INTENSE THAN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION IN THE EXISTING TISSUES IF BOTH PROCESSES WERE EQUALLY ACTIVE THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY COULD NOT INCREASE AND WERE THE WASTE BY TRANSFORMATION GREATER THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY WOULD DECREASE
AND THEIR CONVERSION INTO OXIDISED PRODUCTS FURNISHES THE CLEAREST PROOF THAT FAR MORE OXYGEN IS ABSORBED THAN IS REQUIRED TO CONVERT THE CARBON AND HYDROGEN OF THE METAMORPHOSED TISSUES INTO CARBONIC ACID AND WATER
THERE WOULD BE NO EFFICACY IN SKILL IF ALL MOTIONS TOOK PLACE PERFORCE THEN THINGS WHICH IN TAKING PLACE ARE FREE FROM ANY NECESSITY AS TO THEIR BEING IN THE PRESENT MUST ALSO BEFORE THEY TAKE PLACE BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN WITHOUT NECESSITY
THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN CONSUMED AND AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE THE AMOUNT OF CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OUT BY THE ANIMAL ARE MUCH GREATER THAN IN THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN MAN BUT AN ADULT MAN CONSUMES DAILY ABUT FOURTEEN OZ OF CARBON
YET NO ONE HAS HAD DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE ENOUGH TO FIND A SOLUTION AND THE REASON OF THIS OBSCURITY IS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF HUMAN REASONING CANNOT COPE
WHICH ARE ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION AND RESPIRATION IN THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE GRAIN AND OTHER NUTRITIOUS VEGETABLES YIELD US NOT ONLY IN STARCH SUGAR AND GUM THE CARBON WHICH PROTECTS OUR ORGANS FROM THE ACTION OF OXYGEN
I INQUIRE INTO THE REASONS WHY THOU ART DISSATISFIED WITH THE SOLUTION PROPOSED WHICH IS TO THE EFFECT THAT
LET ME NOW APPLY THE PRINCIPLES ANNOUNCED IN THE PRECEDING LETTERS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR OWN SPECIES MAN WHEN CONFINED TO ANIMAL FOOD
THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL ITS MUSCULAR FIBRE CELLULAR TISSUE NERVOUS MATTER AND BONES MUST HAVE DERIVED THEIR ORIGIN FROM THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT OF MILK THE CASEINE FOR BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO NITROGEN
ON A LIMITED SPACE IS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF INCREASING ITS NUMBERS BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT WHICH IS SOON ATTAINED THE CARBON NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION MUST BE OBTAINED FROM THE ANIMALS
IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SAVAGE STATE OR OF THE WANT OF KNOWLEDGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT I HAVE ALREADY STATED YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT THE SUBSTANCES OF WHICH THE FOOD OF MAN IS COMPOSED MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES
THE PRECEDING CONSIDERATIONS LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH NATURE HAS ADDED TO THE FOOD OF THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS MAMMALIA SUBSTANCES DEVOID OF NITROGEN
MAN IS A TWO LEGGED ANIMAL ENDOWED WITH REASON THIS IS INDEED A UNIVERSAL NOTION YET NO ONE IS IGNORANT THAT THE THING IS IMAGINABLE AND PRESENTABLE TO SENSE BECAUSE THOUGHT CONSIDERS IT NOT BY IMAGINATION OR SENSE
THE ROUNDNESS OF A BODY IS RECOGNISED IN ONE WAY BY SIGHT IN ANOTHER BY TOUCH SIGHT LOOKS UPON IT FROM A DISTANCE AS A WHOLE BY A SIMULTANEOUS REFLECTION OF RAYS TOUCH GRASPS THE ROUNDNESS PIECEMEAL
WHICH THESE ANIMALS CONSUME IN THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF THEIR FOOD WHICH BEARS NO PROPORTION WHATEVER TO THE OXYGEN ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN AND LUNGS A HORSE FOR EXAMPLE
GIVEN IN A FORM ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION THEY SERVE TO HUSBAND THE VITAL FORCE JUST AS MAY BE DONE IN THE CASE OF THE STOMACH BY DUE PREPARATION OF THE FOOD IN GENERAL
IS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE VITAL PROCESS IN ANIMALS THE ANIMAL ORGANISM UNQUESTIONABLY POSSESSES THE POWER OF FORMING FROM THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD
WHICH NEITHER GAINS NOR LOSES WEIGHT PERCEPTIBLY FROM DAY TO DAY ITS NOURISHMENT THE WASTE OF ORGANISED TISSUE AND ITS CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN STAND TO EACH OTHER IN A WELL DEFINED AND FIXED RELATION THE CARBON OF THE CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OFF WITH THAT OF THE URINE
MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CHANGE AND MUST HAVE SERVED SOME PURPOSE IN THE ANIMAL ECONOMY IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GELATINE MUST BE EXPELLED FROM THE BODY IN A FORM DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN WHICH IT WAS INTRODUCED AS FOOD
BY CONTACT AND ATTACHMENT TO THE SURFACE AND BY ACTUAL MOVEMENT ROUND THE PERIPHERY ITSELF MAN HIMSELF LIKEWISE IS VIEWED IN ONE WAY BY SENSE IN ANOTHER BY IMAGINATION IN ANOTHER WAY AGAIN BY THOUGHT
LAST IN INWARD SWIFT REVIEW STRICTLY SIFTS THE FALSE AND TRUE OF THESE AMPLE POTENCIES FITTER CAUSE I WEEN WERE MIND'S SELF THAN MARKS IMPRESSED BY THE OUTER SCENE YET THE BODY THROUGH THE SENSE
THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A FLUID WHICH THE BODY OF THE MOTHER SECRETES IN THE SHAPE OF MILK MILK CONTAINS ONLY ONE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT KNOWN UNDER THE NAME OF CASEINE BESIDES THIS ITS CHIEF INGREDIENTS ARE BUTTER
WHEREAS IF THERE IS NO NECESSITY THEY CAN BY NO MEANS BE FOREKNOWN AND THOU THINKEST THAT NOTHING CAN BE GRASPED AS KNOWN UNLESS IT IS CERTAIN BUT IF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS UNCERTAIN ARE FOREKNOWN AS CERTAIN
MUCH LESS CARBON AND HYDROGEN IN THE FORM ADAPTED FOR THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS THAN CORRESPOND TO THE OXYGEN TAKEN UP IN THE LUNGS
THAN THE FACULTY OF THE THINGS WHICH THEY COGNIZE NOR IS THIS STRANGE FOR SINCE EVERY JUDGMENT IS THE ACT OF THE JUDGE IT IS NECESSARY THAT EACH SHOULD ACCOMPLISH ITS TASK BY ITS OWN NOT BY ANOTHER'S POWER
EMBRACES IMAGES AND SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT RESORTING TO IMAGINATION OR SENSE
AND IF WE CAN TRUST TO THE REPORTS OF PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE RESIDED IN THE EAST
BUT ALONG WITH THIS NITROGEN
NO SHADOW OF UNCERTAINTY WOULD REMAIN WITH A VIEW OF MAKING THIS AT LAST CLEAR AND PLAIN I WILL BEGIN BY CONSIDERING THE ARGUMENTS BY WHICH THOU ART SWAYED FIRST
STRANGE NOTIONS HAS HE SAID THE OLD MAN AH THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THAT SENDING TO SCHOOL IN THESE DAYS IT ONLY DOES HARM
IT WAS NOW NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS LEAVING THE VALES WHEN THE WEST GREW RED THE TWO RELATIVES CAME AGAIN FROM THE HOUSE AND PLUNGED INTO THE HEATH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE FIRST
AS TO GET HOME AGAIN SO SHE WENT ON THE AIR AROUND HER PULSATING SILENTLY AND OPPRESSING THE EARTH WITH LASSITUDE SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY OVERHEAD
YES POOR MAID HER HEART HAS ACHED ENOUGH ABOUT IT HER HEALTH IS SUFFERING FROM IT I HEAR FOR SHE WILL BIDE ENTIRELY INDOORS WE NEVER SEE HER OUT NOW SCAMPERING OVER THE FURZE WITH A FACE AS RED AS A ROSE AS SHE USED TO DO
THAT'S A BAD TROUBLE ABOUT HIS COUSIN THOMASIN
SAID THOMASIN WITH ROUND EYES WHAT DO YOU MEAN DON'T BE ALARMED IT WAS MY DUTY
MADE HIM KNOWN TO THE WATCHMAN OF THE KING HIS WALK IS EXACTLY AS MY HUSBAND'S USED TO BE SHE SAID AND THEN THE THOUGHT BURST UPON HER THAT THE FURZE CUTTER WAS HER SON
THE WORDS OF SAM AND HUMPHREY ON THE HARMONY BETWEEN THE UNKNOWN AND HERSELF HAD ON HER MIND THE EFFECT OF THE INVADING BARD'S PRELUDE IN THE CASTLE OF INDOLENCE
A STRATUM OF ENSAFFRONED LIGHT WAS IMPOSED ON A STRATUM OF DEEP BLUE AND BEHIND THESE LAY STILL REMOTER SCENES WRAPPED IN FRIGID GREY
AND EXHAUSTED STATE TO CONTEMPLATE THEIRS NOT A BOUGH IN THE NINE TREES WHICH COMPOSED THE GROUP BUT WAS SPLINTERED LOPPED AND DISTORTED BY THE FIERCE WEATHER THAT THERE HELD THEM AT ITS MERCY
WHERE HE PAUSED AWHILE ON COMING IN HER TURN TO EACH OF THESE SPOTS SHE FOUND HALF A DOZEN LONG LIMP BRAMBLES WHICH HE HAD CUT FROM THE BUSH DURING HIS HALT AND LAID OUT STRAIGHT BESIDE THE PATH
ON ITS WAY TO THE SQUARE BIT OF SKY AT THE TOP FROM WHICH THE DAYLIGHT STRUCK DOWN WITH A PALLID GLARE UPON THE TATTERS OF SOOT DRAPING THE FLUE AS SEAWEED DRAPES A ROCKY FISSURE SHE REMEMBERED
AT THE TIME THAT EUSTACIA WAS LISTENING TO THE RICK MAKERS CONVERSATION ON CLYM'S RETURN THOMASIN WAS CLIMBING INTO A LOFT OVER HER AUNT'S FUELHOUSE WHERE THE STORE APPLES WERE KEPT
WILL YOU WALK WITH ME TO MEET HIM THIS EVENING I SHOULD LIKE TO ELSE IT WOULD SEEM AS IF I HAD FORGOTTEN HIM SAID THOMASIN TOSSING OUT A BOUGH NOT THAT THAT WOULD MATTER MUCH
AND THEY TELL ME TIS WHERE THE KING'S HEAD WAS CUT OFF YEARS AGO MY POOR MOTHER USED TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT BUSINESS HUMMY SHE USED TO SAY I WAS A YOUNG MAID THEN
EVEN STRONGER AND MORE ACTIVE THAN HER OWN THE TREES BENEATH WHICH SHE SAT WERE SINGULARLY BATTERED RUDE AND WILD AND FOR A FEW MINUTES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT DISMISSED THOUGHTS OF HER OWN STORM BROKEN
BLOWN DOWN IN THE GALES OF PAST YEARS THE PLACE WAS CALLED THE DEVIL'S BELLOWS AND IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO COME THERE ON A MARCH OR NOVEMBER NIGHT TO DISCOVER THE FORCIBLE REASONS FOR THAT NAME
A SMALL APPLE TREE OF THE SORT CALLED RATHERIPE GREW JUST INSIDE THE GATE THE ONLY ONE WHICH THROVE IN THE GARDEN BY REASON OF THE LIGHTNESS OF THE SOIL AND AMONG THE FALLEN APPLES ON THE GROUND BENEATH
AUNT SHE SAID PRESENTLY I HAVE I THINK A RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YES YOU HAVE
THAT FIVE MINUTES OF OVERHEARING FURNISHED EUSTACIA WITH VISIONS ENOUGH TO FILL THE WHOLE BLANK AFTERNOON SUCH SUDDEN ALTERNATIONS FROM MENTAL VACUITY DO SOMETIMES OCCUR
NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN TO SEE THEM TWO MAN AND WIFE THEY'D LOOK VERY NATTY ARM IN CROOK TOGETHER AND THEIR BEST CLOTHES ON WHETHER OR NO
WHY SHOULD SHE NOT GO THAT WAY THE SCENE OF THE DAYDREAM IS SUFFICIENT FOR A PILGRIMAGE AT NINETEEN TO LOOK AT THE PALINGS BEFORE THE YEOBRIGHTS HOUSE HAD THE DIGNITY OF A NECESSARY PERFORMANCE
THOMASIN CAME DOWN WHEN THE APPLES WERE COLLECTED AND TOGETHER THEY WENT THROUGH THE WHITE PALINGS TO THE HEATH BEYOND THE OPEN HILLS WERE AIRY AND CLEAR AND THE REMOTE ATMOSPHERE APPEARED
AND NOT THAT OF A PERSON COME ON BUSINESS OR BY INVITATION HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE WITH INTEREST AND THEN WALKED ROUND AND SCANNED THE OUTER BOUNDARY OF THE GARDEN AS ONE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD IT BEEN THE BIRTHPLACE OF SHAKESPEARE
A WOMAN CAN HARDLY PASS FOR SHAME SOMETIMES
ON THE PRESENT HEATED AFTERNOON WHEN NO PERCEPTIBLE WIND WAS BLOWING THE TREES KEPT UP A PERPETUAL MOAN WHICH ONE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE TO BE CAUSED BY THE AIR
SOME IN THE AIR SOME ON THE HOT GROUND AND VEGETATION SOME IN THE TEPID AND STRINGY WATER OF A NEARLY DRIED POOL ALL THE SHALLOWER PONDS HAD DECREASED TO A VAPOROUS MUD
THEY WERE EVIDENTLY INTENDED FOR FURZE FAGGOT BONDS WHICH HE MEANT TO COLLECT ON HIS RETURN THE SILENT BEING WHO THUS OCCUPIED HIMSELF SEEMED TO BE OF NO MORE ACCOUNT IN LIFE
AS A BLACK SPOT IN THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWN OF THE HILL ON REACHING THIS PLACE MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FELT DISTRESSINGLY AGITATED WEARY AND UNWELL SHE ASCENDED
AND IF JACK AND I CHOOSE TO HAVE A QUICK RUN NOW AND THEN TO PLEASE OURSELVES THAT'S OUR BUSINESS AND NOT YOURS WELL SAID LARRY YOU'LL NEVER BE A RICH MAN MOST LIKELY NOT SAID JERRY
MY CHEST STRAINING MY HEART BEATING IN MY EARS AND THEN HEARING NOTHING OF MONTGOMERY OR HIS MAN AND FEELING UPON THE VERGE OF EXHAUSTION I DOUBLED SHARPLY BACK TOWARDS THE BEACH AS I JUDGED AND LAY DOWN IN THE SHELTER OF A CANEBRAKE
AND COULD ALWAYS TRUST MY DRIVER JERRY WAS QUICK AND PATIENT AT THE SAME TIME AND COULD TRUST HIS HORSE WHICH WAS A GREAT THING TOO HE VERY SELDOM USED THE WHIP I KNEW BY HIS VOICE AND HIS CLICK CLICK WHEN HE WANTED TO GET ON FAST
HE SET OFF AS HARD AS HE COULD JERRY PATTED ME ON THE NECK NO JACK A SHILLING WOULD NOT PAY FOR THAT SORT OF THING WOULD IT OLD BOY ALTHOUGH JERRY WAS DETERMINEDLY SET AGAINST HARD DRIVING
OFTEN GIVING A REDDISH YELLOW TINGE TO THE WHOLE MASS OF FOLIAGE AND FILLING THE AIR WITH POLLEN NO OTHER PINE ON THE RANGE IS SO REGULARLY PLANTED AS THIS ONE COVERING MORAINES THAT EXTEND ALONG THE SIDES OF THE HIGH ROCKY VALLEYS FOR MILES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
AND AS READY AS A HOSPITAL RABBIT FOR MY FATE HE EMERGED BEHIND THE CORNER FOR I HEARD HIM SHOUT PRENDICK THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN AFTER ME SHOUTING THINGS AS HE RAN THIS TIME RUNNING BLINDLY
IT SEEMS TO BE A SURVIVOR OF SOME ANCIENT RACE WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS ITS BROAD STUMPINESS OF COURSE MAKES WIND WAVING OR EVEN SHAKING OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT IT IS NOT THIS ROCKY RIGIDITY THAT CONSTITUTES ITS SILENCE
I TRIED TO MAKE OUT WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT AND IT SEEMS I BORED HIM AFTER ANOTHER QUESTION OR TWO
AND SO THEY DID HARRY WAS AS CLEVER AT STABLE WORK AS A MUCH OLDER BOY AND ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WHAT HE COULD THEN POLLY AND DOLLY USED TO COME IN THE MORNING TO HELP WITH THE CAB TO BRUSH AND BEAT THE CUSHIONS
THE SHORT RIGID NEEDLES IN FASCICLES OF TWO ARE ARRANGED IN COMPARATIVELY LONG CYLINDRICAL TASSELS AT THE ENDS OF THE TOUGH UP CURVING BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG GROWING IN CLUSTERS AMONG THE NEEDLES
IN TURN I RECALLED EACH ONE I HAD SEEN AND TRIED TO DRAW SOME AUGURY OF ASSISTANCE FROM MY MEMORY THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A STAGHOUND BAY AND AT THAT REALISED A NEW DANGER I TOOK LITTLE TIME TO THINK
IT IS AS MASSIVE AND SUGGESTIVE OF ENDURING STRENGTH AS AN OAK ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE TRUNK IS COMMONLY FREE OF LIMBS BUT CLOSE FRINGY TUFTS OF SPRAY OCCUR NEARLY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND
BLOTCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON DRIFTED ACROSS MY EYES MY CONDUCTOR STOPPED SUDDENLY HOME SAID HE AND I STOOD IN A FLOOR OF A CHASM THAT WAS AT FIRST ABSOLUTELY DARK TO ME
PLEASE TO OPEN THE DOOR AND LET US LOSE NO TIME THE NEXT MINUTE JERRY WAS ON THE BOX WITH A CHEERY CHIRRUP TO ME AND A TWITCH OF THE REIN THAT I WELL UNDERSTOOD NOW THEN JACK MY BOY SAID HE SPIN ALONG
COME ALONG SAID HE I WENT WITH HIM TO SEE THE ADVENTURE OUT I GUESSED THE HUTS WERE SOME ROUGH SHELTER WHERE HE AND SOME MORE OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE LIVED I MIGHT PERHAPS FIND THEM FRIENDLY
AND SAVE FOR A FEEBLE BAR OF DEAL SPIKED WITH A SMALL NAIL THE MEREST MOCKERY OF A MACE I WAS UNARMED
AND A GOOD HORSE WHO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER ARE OF ONE MIND IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT THEY CAN DO I HAD A VERY GOOD MOUTH THAT IS I COULD BE GUIDED BY THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF THE REIN AND THAT IS A GREAT THING IN LONDON
I REMEMBERED THAT IF I WERE TOO HARD PRESSED AT LEAST ONE PATH OF ESCAPE FROM TORMENT STILL LAY OPEN TO ME
THE BARK IS OF A BRIGHT CINNAMON COLOR AND IS HANDSOMELY BRAIDED AND RETICULATED ON THRIFTY TREES FLAKING OFF IN THIN SHINING RIBBONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES USED BY THE INDIANS FOR TENT MATTING
WADING UP THE CREEK AND PRESENTLY FINDING MYSELF KNEEDEEP IN A LITTLE STREAM I SCRAMBLED OUT AT LAST ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND WITH MY HEART BEATING LOUDLY IN MY EARS CREPT INTO A TANGLE OF FERNS TO AWAIT THE ISSUE I HEARD THE DOG
IF YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH LONDON FAST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IT WANTS A DEAL OF PRACTICE JERRY AND I WERE USED TO IT AND NO ONE COULD BEAT US AT GETTING THROUGH WHEN WE WERE SET UPON IT I WAS QUICK AND BOLD
MY APE LIKE COMPANION TROTTED ALONG BY MY SIDE WITH HIS HANDS HANGING DOWN AND HIS JAW THRUST FORWARD
AND TORE AWAY THE SIDE RAIL IT HAPPENED THAT A NAIL CAME AWAY WITH THE WOOD AND PROJECTING GAVE A TOUCH OF DANGER TO AN OTHERWISE PETTY WEAPON
IT IS OFTEN BENT AND WEIGHED DOWN TO THE GROUND WHEN LADEN WITH SOFT SNOW THUS FORMING FINE ORNAMENTAL ARCHES MANY OF THEM TO LAST UNTIL THE MELTING OF THE SNOW IN THE SPRING THE MOUNTAIN PINE
JUST WHERE OTHER SPECIES BEGIN TO CROUCH AND DISAPPEAR AT ITS BEST IT IS USUALLY ABOUT NINETY FEET HIGH AND FIVE OR SIX FEET IN DIAMETER THOUGH YOU MAY FIND SPECIMENS HERE AND THERE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THIS
INCREASING IN VELOCITY AND DRAGGING THE FLAMES UPWARD THEN THE LEAVES CATCH FORMING AN IMMENSE COLUMN OF FIRE BEAUTIFULLY SPIRED ON THE EDGES AND TINTED A ROSE PURPLE HUE IT RUSHES ALOFT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE TREE
AND THE ONLY SOUND NEAR ME WAS THE THIN HUM OF SOME SMALL GNATS THAT HAD DISCOVERED ME PRESENTLY I BECAME AWARE OF A DROWSY BREATHING SOUND
I HAD HALF A MIND TO DROWN MYSELF THEN BUT AN ODD WISH TO SEE THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OUT A QUEER IMPERSONAL SPECTACULAR INTEREST IN MYSELF RESTRAINED ME
JERRY BARKER I NEVER KNEW A BETTER MAN THAN MY NEW MASTER HE WAS KIND AND GOOD AND AS STRONG FOR THE RIGHT AS JOHN MANLY AND SO GOOD TEMPERED AND MERRY THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD PICK A QUARREL WITH HIM
MY ENGAGEMENTS AT PRESENT REPLIED WILLOUGHBY CONFUSEDLY ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT I DARE NOT FLATTER MYSELF HE STOPT MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS TOO MUCH ASTONISHED TO SPEAK
ENTIRELY AT AN END LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY AT HIS FATHER THE PAINTER WAS SENT OFF YESTERDAY AND VERY LITTLE WILL REMAIN OF THE THEATRE TO MORROW I KNEW HOW THAT WOULD BE FROM THE FIRST IT IS EARLY FOR BATH YOU WILL FIND NOBODY THERE
SUCH CARELESSNESS OF THE FUTURE AS YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM YOU MUST REMEMBER MY DEAR MOTHER THAT I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THIS MATTER AS CERTAIN I HAVE HAD MY DOUBTS I CONFESS BUT THEY ARE FAINTER THAN THEY WERE
BUT ACTIVE AND METHODICAL HE HAD NOT ONLY DONE ALL THIS BEFORE HE RESUMED HIS SEAT AS MASTER OF THE HOUSE AT DINNER
HE COULD NOT HELP GIVING MISSUS NORRIS A HINT OF HIS HAVING HOPED THAT HER ADVICE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTERPOSED TO PREVENT WHAT HER JUDGMENT MUST CERTAINLY HAVE DISAPPROVED THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN VERY INCONSIDERATE IN FORMING THE PLAN
HER SENSATIONS WERE INDEFINABLE AND SO WERE THEY A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS UPON HEARING HENRY CRAWFORD WHO HAD A CHAIR BETWEEN HERSELF AND TOM ASK THE LATTER IN AN UNDERVOICE WHETHER THERE WERE ANY PLANS FOR RESUMING THE PLAY
AND WHILE THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION
PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE HAS OTHER VIEWS FOR HIM AND ON THAT ACCOUNT IS EAGER TO GET HIM AWAY AND THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH SHE SENDS HIM OFF TO TRANSACT IS INVENTED AS AN EXCUSE TO DISMISS HIM
HENRY CRAWFORD WAS AGAIN IN THE HOUSE HE WALKED UP WITH DOCTOR GRANT WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO SIR THOMAS AND AT RATHER AN EARLY HOUR THEY WERE USHERED INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE WERE MOST OF THE FAMILY SIR THOMAS SOON APPEARED
AND NO REASON IN THE WORLD TO THINK ILL OF TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MOTIVES UNANSWERABLE IN THEMSELVES THOUGH UNAVOIDABLY SECRET FOR A WHILE AND AFTER ALL WHAT IS IT YOU SUSPECT HIM OF
AND THIS WAS SUCH A DAY I COULD NOT HELP GOING TO HIM UP IN HIS ROOM BEFORE WE SET OFF TO ADVISE HIM NOT TO VENTURE HE WAS PUTTING ON HIS WIG SO I SAID COACHMAN
YOU CANNOT DOUBT YOUR SISTER'S WISHES IT MUST BE WILLOUGHBY THEREFORE WHOM YOU SUSPECT BUT WHY IS HE NOT A MAN OF HONOUR AND FEELING HAS THERE BEEN ANY INCONSISTENCY ON HIS SIDE TO CREATE ALARM CAN HE BE DECEITFUL
AS A DIFFERENCE IN JUDGMENT FROM MYSELF OR A DEVIATION FROM WHAT I MAY THINK RIGHT AND CONSISTENT YOU SPEAK VERY PROPERLY WILLOUGHBY CERTAINLY DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE SUSPECTED
THE SLIGHTEST MENTION OF ANYTHING RELATIVE TO WILLOUGHBY OVERPOWERED HER IN AN INSTANT
WITH A PURER SPIRIT DID FANNY REJOICE IN THE INTELLIGENCE SHE HEARD IT AT DINNER AND FELT IT A BLESSING BY ALL THE OTHERS IT WAS MENTIONED WITH REGRET AND HIS MERITS HONOURED WITH DUE GRADATION OF FEELING
I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS THINK THE ACQUAINTANCE WORTH ANY TROUBLE THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN TO ESTABLISH IT THERE IS NOTHING VERY STRIKING IN MISTER RUSHWORTH'S MANNERS BUT I WAS PLEASED LAST NIGHT WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE HIS OPINION ON ONE SUBJECT
THE REPROOF OF AN IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION OF EVERYTHING THE SWEEP OF EVERY PREPARATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENT THERE WAS ONE PERSON HOWEVER IN THE HOUSE WHOM HE COULD NOT LEAVE TO LEARN HIS SENTIMENTS MERELY THROUGH HIS CONDUCT
BUT ALL THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY SUCH A SITUATION OF HIS AFFAIRS AS YOU HAVE SUPPOSED HE HAD JUST PARTED FROM MY SISTER HAD SEEN HER LEAVE HIM IN THE GREATEST AFFLICTION AND IF HE FELT OBLIGED FROM A FEAR OF OFFENDING MISSUS SMITH
IT SEEMS BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT AND LAST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US SO HAPPY SO CHEERFUL SO AFFECTIONATE AND NOW AFTER ONLY TEN MINUTES NOTICE GONE TOO WITHOUT INTENDING TO RETURN
AND ANOTHER PAUSE SUCCEEDED THIS WAS BROKEN BY WILLOUGHBY WHO SAID WITH A FAINT SMILE IT IS FOLLY TO LINGER IN THIS MANNER I WILL NOT TORMENT MYSELF ANY LONGER BY REMAINING AMONG FRIENDS WHOSE SOCIETY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOW TO ENJOY
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ODD THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE US WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING EVERYTHING TO ME AT ONCE BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT IN SOME RESPECTS NOT PROSPEROUSLY BEGUN FOR THEIR MARRIAGE MUST BE AT A VERY UNCERTAIN DISTANCE
HE WAS GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY BEING TO MEET HIS UNCLE AT BATH WITHOUT DELAY BUT IF THERE WERE ANY PROSPECT OF A RENEWAL OF LOVERS VOWS HE SHOULD HOLD HIMSELF POSITIVELY ENGAGED HE SHOULD BREAK THROUGH EVERY OTHER CLAIM
AND SO ENDED ALL THE HOPES HIS SELFISH VANITY HAD RAISED IN MARIA AND JULIA BERTRAM JULIA COULD REJOICE THAT HE WAS GONE HIS PRESENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BE ODIOUS TO HER AND IF MARIA GAINED HIM NOT
SAID SHE AS SHE SAT DOWN TO WORK AND WITH HOW HEAVY A HEART DOES HE TRAVEL IT IS ALL VERY STRANGE
HIS DECIDED PREFERENCE OF A QUIET FAMILY PARTY TO THE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION OF ACTING HE SEEMED TO FEEL EXACTLY AS ONE COULD WISH YES INDEED AND THE MORE YOU KNOW OF HIM THE BETTER YOU WILL LIKE HIM HE IS NOT A SHINING CHARACTER
ONE MOMENT SHE FEARED THAT NO SERIOUS DESIGN HAD EVER BEEN FORMED ON HIS SIDE AND THE NEXT THAT SOME UNFORTUNATE QUARREL HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HER SISTER
FEEL HIS MOTIVES TO DESERVE AND ACKNOWLEDGING WITH PERFECT INGENUOUSNESS THAT HIS CONCESSION HAD BEEN ATTENDED WITH SUCH PARTIAL GOOD AS TO MAKE HIS JUDGMENT IN IT VERY DOUBTFUL HE WAS ANXIOUS
YOU MUST THINK WRETCHEDLY INDEED OF WILLOUGHBY IF AFTER ALL THAT HAS OPENLY PASSED BETWEEN THEM YOU CAN DOUBT THE NATURE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH THEY ARE TOGETHER HAS HE BEEN ACTING A PART IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO YOUR SISTER ALL THIS TIME
AND AM THE MORE CONCERNED THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MY DEAR SIR THOMAS IF YOU HAD SEEN THE STATE OF THE ROADS THAT DAY I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOT THROUGH THEM THOUGH WE HAD THE FOUR HORSES OF COURSE
HE WROTE THIS EDITORIAL GOING TO FLAY HIM ALIVE
OH AMORY LOOK AT THAT FOREHEAD ON EMERSON LOOK AT TOLSTOI'S EYES HIS TONE WAS REPROACHFUL AMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD NO CALL THEM REMARKABLE LOOKING
HOW MUCH IT WAS WORTH WHILE BEING A DIPLOMATIC AUTOCRAT AROUND HIS CLUB ON PROSPECT AVENUE AND BASKING IN THE HIGH LIGHTS OF CLASS OFFICE IT WAS DISTINCTLY THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF ARISTOCRACY THAT BURNE FOUND HIS WAY AMORY THROUGH KERRY
A PHOTOGRAPHIC COLLECTION OF HEAVILY BEARDED SHAGGY CELEBRITIES TOLSTOI WHITMAN CARPENTER AND OTHERS AREN'T THEY WONDERFUL AMORY TRIED POLITELY TO APPRECIATE THEM AND GAVE UP LAUGHINGLY BURNE
OLIVER CROMWELL SAID IT DIDN'T HE OR WAS IT WASHINGTON OR ONE OF THE SAINTS GOOD LORD I'VE FORGOTTEN BURNE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER OH JESSE OH GOOD KIND JESSE WHO SAID IT FOR PETE'S SAKE WELL SAID BURNE RECOVERING HIS VOICE
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM LATELY NO THEN YOU HAVEN'T ANY CONCEPTION OF HIM THE ARGUMENT ENDED NOWHERE
THEY HAD HASHED AND REHASHED FOR MANY A FRUGAL CONVERSATIONAL MEAL THAT NIGHT THEY DISCUSSED THE CLUBS UNTIL TWELVE AND IN THE MAIN THEY AGREED WITH BURNE
FINALLY TOOK A POSITION THAT WAS BRILLIANTLY NEUTRAL IN FACT
UNABASHED BURNE RAN HIS HAND LOVINGLY ACROSS THE SPACIOUS FOREHEADS AND PILING UP THE PICTURES PUT THEM BACK IN HIS DESK WALKING AT NIGHT WAS ONE OF HIS FAVORITE PURSUITS AND ONE NIGHT HE PERSUADED AMORY TO ACCOMPANY HIM
PHYLLIS HAD PINNED HIM DOWN AND SERVED HIM UP
THEY TALKED UNTIL THREE FROM BIOLOGY TO ORGANIZED RELIGION AND WHEN AMORY CREPT SHIVERING INTO BED
SO HE TURNED ON HIS READING LAMP AND TAKING DOWN THE KREUTZER SONATA SEARCHED IT CAREFULLY FOR THE GERMS OF BURNE'S ENTHUSIASM BEING BURNE WAS SUDDENLY SO MUCH REALLER THAN BEING CLEVER YET HE SIGHED HERE WERE OTHER POSSIBLE CLAY FEET
NEVER ENTERS THE PHILADELPHIAN SOCIETY HE HAS NO FAITH IN THAT ROT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS AND A KIND WORD IN TIME WILL RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THE WORLD MOREOVER HE TAKES A DRINK WHENEVER HE FEELS LIKE IT HE CERTAINLY IS GETTING IN WRONG
I HATE THE DARK AMORY OBJECTED I DIDN'T USE TO EXCEPT WHEN I WAS PARTICULARLY IMAGINATIVE BUT NOW I REALLY DO I'M A REGULAR FOOL ABOUT IT THAT'S USELESS YOU KNOW QUITE POSSIBLY
AND THE KREUTZER SONATA OF COURSE BUT TOLSTOI IS MOSTLY IN THE ORIGINAL RUSSIAN AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED HE'S THE GREATEST MAN IN HUNDREDS OF YEARS CRIED BURNE ENTHUSIASTICALLY
BUT IT DOES REPRESENT SUCCESS HERE IN A GENERAL WAY WELL I SUPPOSE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF EVERY CLASS HERE ARE BLONDS ARE REALLY LIGHT YET TWO THIRDS OF EVERY SENIOR COUNCIL ARE LIGHT WE LOOKED AT PICTURES OF TEN YEARS OF THEM MIND YOU
THE NEXT MORNING HE MET BURNE HURRYING ALONG MC COSH WALK AFTER A RECITATION WHITHER BOUND TSAR OVER TO THE PRINCE OFFICE TO SEE FERRENBY
YES BUT THAT QUOTATION JESSE SAT UP WHAT QUOTATION YOU KNOW HE WHO IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME WELL WHAT ABOUT IT JESSE WAS PUZZLED BUT NOT ALARMED WELL YOU SAY HERE LET ME SEE
DOVETAILED SO COMPLETELY WITH EVERYTHING THEY HAD THOUGHT THAT THEY QUESTIONED RATHER THAN ARGUED AND ENVIED THE SANITY THAT ENABLED THIS MAN TO STAND OUT SO AGAINST ALL TRADITIONS THEN AMORY BRANCHED OFF AND FOUND THAT BURNE WAS DEEP IN OTHER THINGS AS WELL
IN POLITICS AND BUSINESS ONE FOUND HIM AND AMONG THE OLD STATESMEN AND KINGS AND GENERALS
BUT THOUGHT THAT BURNE AND FRED WERE TWO VARSITY SPORTS SHOWING THEIR GIRL A COLLEGIATE TIME PHYLLIS'S FEELINGS AS SHE WAS PARADED BY THE HARVARD AND PRINCETON STANDS WHERE SAT DOZENS OF HER FORMER DEVOTEES CAN BE IMAGINED SHE TRIED TO WALK A LITTLE AHEAD
NO BURNE I CAN'T GO THAT WELL LET'S WAIVE IT WE WON'T GET ANYWHERE AND BESIDES I HAVEN'T QUITE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT MYSELF NOW HERE'S SOMETHING I DO KNOW PERSONAL APPEARANCE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT COLORING
HOW ABOUT YOU TOM TOM NODDED SHEEPISHLY WELL CONTINUED BURNE
I THINK THEY'RE THE UGLIEST LOOKING CROWD I EVER CAME ACROSS
HAD HAD A VAGUE DRIFTING ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM
WITH HIS ADULATION OF THIRTEENTH CENTURY CATHEDRALS A CATHOLICISM WHICH AMORY FOUND CONVENIENT AND READY MADE WITHOUT PRIEST OR SACRAMENTS OR SACRIFICE
QUITE SUBMERGED IN HIS BROTHER'S PERSONALITY
THAN THAT I SHOULD TURN BACK AND I DID GO INTO THEM NOT ONLY FOLLOWED THE ROAD THROUGH THEM BUT WALKED INTO THEM UNTIL I WASN'T FRIGHTENED ANY MORE
ONE IS ON THE SENIOR COUNCIL AND OF THE DARK HAIRED MEN IT'S ONLY ONE IN FIFTY IT'S TRUE BURNE AGREED THE LIGHT HAIRED MAN IS A HIGHER TYPE GENERALLY SPEAKING
PLOTTED THE IMPERFECTABILITY OF MAN AND READ SHAW AND CHESTERTON ENOUGH TO KEEP HIS MIND FROM THE EDGES OF DECADENCE
NONE OTHER GODS SINISTER STREET AND THE RESEARCH MAGNIFICENT WERE EXAMPLES OF SUCH BOOKS IT WAS THE LATTER OF THESE THREE THAT GRIPPED BURNE HOLIDAY AND MADE HIM WONDER IN THE BEGINNING OF SENIOR YEAR
OH MODERATELY WELL BURNE'S A DAMN GOOD TALKER AND SO OBVIOUSLY SINCERE THAT YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE WITH HIM IT'S SO EVIDENT THAT RESIGNING FROM HIS CLUB MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO HIM THAN PREVENTING IT DOES TO US THAT I FELT FUTILE WHEN I ARGUED
TORN BETWEEN HORRIFIED PITY AND RIOTOUS MIRTH AND AS PHYLLIS WITH HER SVELTE JAW DROPPING APPROACHED THE PAIR BENT OVER AND EMITTED A COLLEGE CHEER IN LOUD FAR CARRYING VOICES THOUGHTFULLY ADDING THE NAME PHYLLIS TO THE END
ON A FEW LINES ON WHAT I CONSIDER THE ESSENTIAL LINES POETRY WELL FRANKLY NOT WHAT YOU CALL POETRY OR FOR YOUR REASONS YOU TWO WRITE OF COURSE AND LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHITMAN IS THE MAN THAT ATTRACTS ME WHITMAN
ABOUT A HUNDRED JUNIORS AND SENIORS RESIGNED FROM THEIR CLUBS IN A FINAL FURY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE CLUBS IN HELPLESSNESS TURNED UPON BURNE THEIR FINEST WEAPON RIDICULE EVERY ONE WHO KNEW HIM LIKED HIM BUT WHAT HE STOOD FOR AND HE BEGAN TO STAND FOR MORE ALL THE TIME
PROPERTY OF DEAN HOLLISTER BOUGHT AND PAID FOR
SAID ALICE WHAT THAT MEANS NOW YOU TALK LIKE A REASONABLE CHILD SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING VERY MUCH PLEASED I MEANT BY IMPENETRABILITY
HORSES AND ALL THE KING'S MEN COULDN'T PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY IN HIS PLACE AGAIN THAT LAST LINE IS MUCH TOO LONG FOR THE POETRY SHE ADDED
BUT THE COLLAR THE MOST FOR HE WAS A REAL BOASTER I HAVE HAD SUCH AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF SWEETHEARTS SAID THE COLLAR I COULD NOT BE IN PEACE IT IS TRUE
IF HE SMILED MUCH MORE THE ENDS OF HIS MOUTH MIGHT MEET BEHIND SHE THOUGHT AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIS HEAD I'M AFRAID IT WOULD COME OFF
PRUDE EXCLAIMED THE COLLAR AND THEN IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE WASHING TUB IT WAS STARCHED HUNG OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR IN THE SUNSHINE AND WAS THEN LAID ON THE IRONING BLANKET
THAT'S A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE ONE WORD MEAN ALICE SAID IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE WHEN I MAKE A WORD DO A LOT OF WORK LIKE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY
IT'S VERY PROVOKING HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID AFTER A LONG SILENCE LOOKING AWAY FROM ALICE AS HE SPOKE TO BE CALLED AN EGG VERY
YOU'RE SO EXACTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THE FACE IS WHAT ONE GOES BY GENERALLY ALICE REMARKED IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE THAT'S JUST WHAT I COMPLAIN OF
HUMPTY DUMPTY CRIED BREAKING INTO A SUDDEN PASSION YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING AT DOORS AND BEHIND TREES AND DOWN CHIMNEYS OR YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT
SHE ADDED HOPING TO TURN HER REMARK INTO A SORT OF A COMPLIMENT SOME PEOPLE SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING AWAY FROM HER AS USUAL HAVE NO MORE SENSE THAN A BABY
IS THE GRASS PLOT ROUND A SUN DIAL I SUPPOSE SAID ALICE SURPRISED AT HER OWN INGENUITY
BUT I AM EXTREMELY SORRY FOR THE GARTER I MEAN THE GIRDLE THAT WENT INTO THE WATER TUB I HAVE MUCH ON MY CONSCIENCE I WANT TO BECOME WHITE PAPER
AND THEY PUT ME OUT I SENT A MESSAGE TO THE FISH I TOLD THEM
I WENT AND SHOUTED IN HIS EAR HUMPTY DUMPTY RAISED HIS VOICE ALMOST TO A SCREAM
HIS LEGS CROSSED LIKE A TURK ON THE TOP OF A HIGH WALL SUCH A NARROW ONE THAT ALICE QUITE WONDERED HOW HE COULD KEEP HIS BALANCE AND
THERE ARE TWO MEANINGS PACKED UP INTO ONE WORD I SEE IT NOW ALICE REMARKED THOUGHTFULLY AND WHAT ARE TOVES
CERTAINLY SAID ALICE
BUT GLORY DOESN'T MEAN A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT ALICE OBJECTED WHEN I USE A WORD HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN RATHER A SCORNFUL TONE
ALICE SAID INDIGNANTLY TOO PROUD THE OTHER INQUIRED
HE SAID I'D GO AND WAKE THEM IF I TOOK A CORKSCREW FROM THE SHELF I WENT TO WAKE THEM UP MYSELF AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED I PULLED AND PUSHED
I SEE WELL THAT YOU ARE BOTH FOR USE AND ORNAMENT
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
HE SAID AT LAST WHEN A PERSON DOESN'T KNOW A CRAVAT FROM A BELT I KNOW IT'S VERY IGNORANT OF ME ALICE SAID
I'M NOT PROUD YOU MAY SHAKE HANDS WITH ME
OF COURSE I DON'T THINK SO WHY IF
HOW OLD DID YOU SAY YOU WERE ALICE MADE A SHORT CALCULATION AND SAID SEVEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS WRONG
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A HISTORY OF ENGLAND THAT IS NOW TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME I'M ONE THAT HAS SPOKEN TO A KING I AM
ALMOST OUT LOUD FORGETTING THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY WOULD HEAR HER DON'T STAND THERE CHATTERING TO YOURSELF LIKE THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID LOOKING AT HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
DO YOU SEEK MY HAND SAID THE SCISSORS
SHE WAS A GIRDLE SO FINE SO SOFT AND SO CHARMING SHE THREW HERSELF INTO A TUB OF WATER FOR MY SAKE
HUMPTY DUMPTY REMARKED SEVERELY ALICE WAS SILENT IN SPRING WHEN WOODS ARE GETTING GREEN
EVIDENTLY ADDRESSED TO A TREE SO SHE STOOD AND SOFTLY REPEATED TO HERSELF HUMPTY DUMPTY SAT ON A WALL HUMPTY DUMPTY HAD A GREAT FALL ALL THE KING'S
HOW OLD ARE YOU ALICE EXPLAINED IF I'D MEANT THAT
ALL HE COULD UNDERSTAND WAS THAT A FAR WORSE THING HAD HAPPENED THAN ANYTHING HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED A FORGERY HE SAID A FORGERY AND A CLUMSY ONE
IT EMBRACES A HUNDRED DEGREES OF MEANING MIKE HAD EXPECTED SENTENCE OF DISMISSAL AND HE HAD GOT IT SO FAR HE HAD NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
HAGGERSTON HAS OUR DIRECTIONS AND ALL WILL BE COMPLETED IN A WEEK THEY WILL THEN JOIN HIS REGIMENT UNLESS THEY ARE FIRST INVITED TO LONGBOURN AND I UNDERSTAND FROM MISSUS GARDINER THAT MY NIECE IS VERY DESIROUS OF SEEING YOU ALL BEFORE SHE LEAVES THE SOUTH
I SHALL LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS
EXCEEDED ALL SHE COULD BELIEVE POSSIBLE
BUT HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT ROUND WHICH IT REVOLVED
LOOK HERE SMITH HE SAID I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU I'M IN A BIT OF A HOLE
WHO BELIEVED THAT THE EARTH WAS FLAT AND ADDRESSED MEETINGS ON THE SUBJECT IN HYDE PARK ON SUNDAYS AND MANY OTHERS
OH MAMMA DO THE PEOPLE HEREABOUTS KNOW I AM MARRIED TO DAY I WAS AFRAID THEY MIGHT NOT AND WE OVERTOOK WILLIAM GOULDING IN HIS CURRICLE
APPLIES FOR A RISE OF SALARY NOW POSSIBLY IN YOUR CASE IN MY CASE INTERRUPTED MIKE THERE WAS NONE OF THAT ROT BICKERSDYKE WASN'T PUTTING IT ON HE MEANT EVERY WORD
THE HAPPY THOUGHT STRUCK HIM OF CONSULTING PSMITH IT WAS HIS HOUR FOR POTTERING
OH IT'S HARD I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT ON ANY OTHER DAY BUT THAT I COULD NOT HAVE MISSED IT THEY SHOWED ME THE CHEQUE IN THERE JUST NOW I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I HAD PASSED IT I DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT MY MIND WAS FAR AWAY I DON'T REMEMBER THE CHEQUE OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT
BUT MY ABSENCE WILL NOT SPELL IRRETRIEVABLE RUIN AS IT WOULD AT A PERIOD OF GREATER COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY COMRADES ROSSITER AND BRISTOW HAVE STUDIED MY METHODS THEY KNOW HOW I LIKE THINGS TO BE DONE THEY ARE FULLY COMPETENT TO CONDUCT THE BUSINESS OF THE DEPARTMENT IN MY ABSENCE
HE CONFIDED TO MIKE HIS INTENTION OF LEAVING THE BANK AS SOON AS HE HAD MADE A NAME AND TAKING SERIOUSLY TO THE BUSINESS HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD KNOCKED THEM AT THE BEDFORD THE WEEK BEFORE AND IN SUPPORT OF THE STATEMENT SHOWED HIM A CUTTING FROM THE ERA IN WHICH THE WRITER SAID THAT
AND CENTRED AND SANDY TURNBULL HEADED A BEAUTIFUL GOAL
HE MURMURED MUSINGLY I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT COMRADE WALLER'S MISFORTUNES CANNOT BUT BE TRIVIAL COMPARED WITH MINE BUT POSSIBLY IT WILL BE AS WELL TO ASCERTAIN THEIR NATURE I WILL REEL ROUND AND MAKE INQUIRIES GOOD MAN SAID MIKE
THEIR SISTER'S WEDDING DAY ARRIVED AND JANE AND ELIZABETH FELT FOR HER PROBABLY MORE THAN SHE FELT FOR HERSELF THE CARRIAGE WAS SENT TO MEET THEM AT AND THEY WERE TO RETURN IN IT BY DINNER TIME THEIR ARRIVAL WAS DREADED BY THE ELDER MISS BENNETS AND JANE MORE ESPECIALLY
HE WAS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT A CAUSE OF SO LITTLE ADVANTAGE TO ANYONE SHOULD BE FORWARDED AT THE SOLE EXPENSE OF HIS BROTHER IN LAW
I SUCCEEDED YESTERDAY IN INDUCING THE MAN BRISTOW TO ABANDON THAT RAINBOW WAISTCOAT OF HIS TODAY I ENTER THE BUILDING BLYTHE AND BUOYANT WORN OF COURSE FROM THE LONG STRUGGLE BUT SEEING WITH ACHING EYES THE DAWN OF ANOTHER BETTER ERA
YET THERE IT IS ONCE MORE MIKE WAS TONGUE TIED FOR THE LIFE OF HIM HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY
AS SOON AS HE SHOULD BE OF AGE AND THE WIDOW AND YOUNGER CHILDREN WOULD BY THAT MEANS BE PROVIDED FOR
MIKE WISHED HIM LUCK AND THERE WAS RAYMOND WHO DABBLED IN JOURNALISM AND WAS THE AUTHOR OF STRAIGHT TALKS TO HOUSEWIVES IN TRIFLES UNDER THE PSEUDONYM OF LADY GUSSIE WRAGGE
MISTER WICKHAM HAD RECEIVED HIS COMMISSION BEFORE HE LEFT LONDON AND HE WAS TO JOIN HIS REGIMENT AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT NO ONE BUT MISSUS BENNET REGRETTED THAT THEIR STAY WOULD BE SO SHORT AND SHE MADE THE MOST OF THE TIME BY VISITING ABOUT WITH HER DAUGHTER AND HAVING VERY FREQUENT PARTIES AT HOME
OR RATHER BEING APPARENTLY CERTAIN TO END SATISFACTORILY FOR THE INVALID THOUGH OUT OF DANGER WAS STILL IN BED
CONCERNING A CHEQUE THINGS NEVER HAPPEN QUITE AS ONE EXPECTS THEM TO MIKE CAME TO THE OFFICE NEXT MORNING PREPARED FOR A REPETITION OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HE WAS AMAZED TO FIND THE CASHIER NOT MERELY CHEERFUL BUT EVEN EXUBERANTLY CHEERFUL
BEEN LED TO MAKE MISTER DARCY ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR FEARS FOR HER SISTER FOR SINCE HER MARRIAGE WOULD SO SHORTLY GIVE THE PROPER TERMINATION TO THE ELOPEMENT
COULD BE SPUN OUT FROM HALF PAST TWELVE TO TWO MORE WORK FROM TWO TILL HALF PAST THREE FROM HALF PAST THREE TILL HALF PAST FOUR TEA IN THE TEAROOM WITH A NOVEL
THE MARRIAGE OF A DAUGHTER WHICH HAD BEEN THE FIRST OBJECT OF HER WISHES SINCE JANE WAS SIXTEEN WAS NOW ON THE POINT OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND HER THOUGHTS AND HER WORDS RAN WHOLLY ON THOSE ATTENDANTS OF ELEGANT NUPTIALS FINE MUSLINS NEW CARRIAGES AND SERVANTS
NOT HOWEVER FROM ANY FEAR OF DISADVANTAGE FROM IT INDIVIDUALLY TO HERSELF FOR AT ANY RATE THERE SEEMED A GULF IMPASSABLE BETWEEN THEM
THE SITUATION WAS TICKLING HIM MISTER WALLER HAS TOLD ME HE BEGAN I HAVE ALREADY SEEN MISTER WALLER I KNOW HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE CHEQUE I CAME TO EXPLAIN EXPLAIN YES
HIS LIFE WAS VERY REGULAR
PSMITH STIRRED HIS COFFEE BEFORE REPLYING
WHY HE SAID IT WAS A FORGERY MUTTERED MISTER WALLER SITTING DOWN HEAVILY MIKE COULD NOT TAKE IT IN ALL AT ONCE HE WAS STUNNED
I THINK THERE CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE SAID ON THE SUBJECT LA
WHO HAD GENERALLY SOME FRESH GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE RING WEARING BRISTOW TO AIR FROM ELEVEN TO HALF PAST TWELVE HE WOULD PUT IN A LITTLE GENTLE WORK LUNCH
MY UNCLE AND AUNT AND I WERE TO GO TOGETHER AND THE OTHERS WERE TO MEET US AT THE CHURCH WELL MONDAY MORNING CAME AND I WAS IN SUCH A FUSS I WAS SO AFRAID YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO PUT IT OFF
INTO ONE HOUSE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THEY SHALL NEVER HAVE ADMITTANCE I WILL NOT ENCOURAGE THE IMPUDENCE OF EITHER BY RECEIVING THEM AT LONGBOURN A LONG DISPUTE FOLLOWED THIS DECLARATION BUT MISTER BENNET WAS FIRM IT SOON LED TO ANOTHER
BUT ALL IS NOT YET LOST YOU MUST RECOLLECT THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPOKE IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT THAT GENEROUS TEMPERAMENT WAS STIRRED TO ITS DEPTHS HE DID NOT PICK HIS WORDS BUT CALM WILL SUCCEED STORM AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING YET
BUT NO SUCH HAPPY MARRIAGE COULD NOW TEACH THE ADMIRING MULTITUDE WHAT CONNUBIAL FELICITY REALLY WAS
RESULTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I COMMENCED WITH THE SIMPLEST AND MOST GENERAL TRUTHS AND THAT THUS EACH TRUTH DISCOVERED WAS A RULE AVAILABLE IN THE DISCOVERY OF SUBSEQUENT ONES
THAT I CANNOT IN ANY DEGREE APPROVE OF THOSE RESTLESS AND BUSY MEDDLERS WHO CALLED NEITHER BY BIRTH NOR FORTUNE TO TAKE PART IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS ARE YET ALWAYS PROJECTING REFORMS
LOVING THANKFUL WOMANLY ACTION BUT THE HAND MADE NO RESPONSE DROPPED COLD AND HEAVY AND TOOK TO ITS KNITTING AGAIN THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ITS TOUCH THAT GAVE LUCIE A CHECK
YES THAT SHE MAY BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE THE FACES AND KNOW THE PERSONS IT IS FOR THEIR SAFETY BEGINNING TO BE STRUCK BY DEFARGE'S MANNER MISTER LORRY LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIM AND LED THE WAY
PROVIDED I TOOK THE FIRM AND UNWAVERING RESOLUTION NEVER IN A SINGLE INSTANCE TO FAIL IN OBSERVING THEM THE FIRST WAS NEVER TO ACCEPT ANYTHING FOR TRUE
CHARLES IS SAFE BUT I CANNOT SAFELY LEAVE THIS PLACE YET I HAVE OBTAINED THE FAVOUR THAT THE BEARER HAS A SHORT NOTE FROM CHARLES TO HIS WIFE
PERCEIVING FURTHER THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THESE RELATIONS I SHOULD SOMETIMES HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM ONE BY ONE AND SOMETIMES ONLY TO BEAR THEM IN MIND OR EMBRACE THEM IN THE AGGREGATE
OR WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS ARE INSECURE WITH THIS BEFORE ME BY WAY OF EXAMPLE I WAS PERSUADED THAT IT WOULD INDEED BE PREPOSTEROUS FOR A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TO THINK OF REFORMING A STATE BY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING IT THROUGHOUT
REPUDIATED HIM HE LIVED IN THE MOST VIOLENT QUARTER AND DOUBTLESS WAS INFLUENTIAL THERE AND DEEP IN ITS DANGEROUS WORKINGS NOON COMING AND THE DOCTOR NOT RETURNING
WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DEMUR BUT THE GREAT TRUST HE HELD WAS NOT HIS OWN AND AS TO THAT BUSINESS CHARGE
WHO HAD LEFT HER IN EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE SOME SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO IT IS SHE OBSERVED HER HUSBAND DOES MADAME GO WITH US INQUIRED MISTER LORRY SEEING THAT SHE MOVED AS THEY MOVED
WITH DARK CURLING HAIR FROM FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY YEARS OF AGE FOR ANSWER HE REPEATED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EMPHASIS THE WORDS DO YOU KNOW ME I HAVE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE PERHAPS AT MY WINE SHOP
AND HE THOUGHT OF FINDING OUT THE WINE SHOP AGAIN AND TAKING COUNSEL WITH ITS MASTER IN REFERENCE TO THE SAFEST DWELLING PLACE IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE CITY BUT THE SAME CONSIDERATION THAT SUGGESTED HIM
I HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTS WITH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMMENCE FOR I WAS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW AND CONSIDERING THAT OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO SOUGHT
HAVE FOLLOWED THE APPOINTMENTS OF SOME WISE LEGISLATOR IT IS THUS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TRUE RELIGION THE ORDINANCES OF WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM GOD MUST BE INCOMPARABLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF EVERY OTHER
AND OVERTURNING IT IN ORDER TO SET IT UP AMENDED AND THE SAME I THOUGHT WAS TRUE OF ANY SIMILAR PROJECT FOR REFORMING THE BODY OF THE SCIENCES OR THE ORDER OF TEACHING THEM ESTABLISHED IN THE SCHOOLS
AND RIDICULOUS I WAS THUS LED TO INFER THAT THE GROUND OF OUR OPINIONS IS FAR MORE CUSTOM AND EXAMPLE THAN ANY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE AND FINALLY ALTHOUGH SUCH BE THE GROUND OF OUR OPINIONS
WAS THIS THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO IMPERIL TELLSON'S BY SHELTERING THE WIFE OF AN EMIGRANT PRISONER UNDER THE BANK ROOF HIS OWN POSSESSIONS SAFETY LIFE HE WOULD HAVE HAZARDED FOR LUCIE AND HER CHILD
TO THE VENGEANCE WHOM HER EYES FIRST ENCOUNTERED WELL I AM SURE BOLDFACE I HOPE
I MIGHT ASCEND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND AS IT WERE STEP BY STEP TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MORE COMPLEX ASSIGNING IN THOUGHT A CERTAIN ORDER EVEN TO THOSE OBJECTS WHICH IN THEIR OWN NATURE DO NOT STAND IN A RELATION OF ANTECEDENCE AND SEQUENCE
BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS I WAS INDUCED TO SEEK SOME OTHER METHOD WHICH WOULD COMPRISE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE THREE AND BE EXEMPT FROM THEIR DEFECTS AND AS A MULTITUDE OF LAWS OFTEN ONLY HAMPERS JUSTICE
AND WAS BESIDES FORTUNATELY UNDISTURBED BY ANY CARES OR PASSIONS I REMAINED THE WHOLE DAY IN SECLUSION WITH FULL OPPORTUNITY TO OCCUPY MY ATTENTION WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS
I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER THE BETTER TO CONSIDER THEM INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD VIEW THEM AS SUBSISTING BETWEEN STRAIGHT LINES THAN WHICH I COULD FIND NO OBJECTS MORE SIMPLE
YOU WILL DO HIM NO HARM YOU WILL HELP ME TO SEE HIM IF YOU CAN YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT MY BUSINESS HERE RETURNED MADAME DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE IT IS THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR FATHER WHO IS MY BUSINESS HERE
FOR NEITHER OF WHICH WOULD THIS BE AT ALL A BEFITTING RESOLUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE OF THOSE WHO WITH MORE THAN A DUE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN POWERS ARE PRECIPITATE IN THEIR JUDGMENTS AND WANT THE PATIENCE REQUISITE FOR ORDERLY AND CIRCUMSPECT THINKING
NOR IN THIS PERHAPS SHALL I APPEAR TOO VAIN IF IT BE CONSIDERED THAT AS THE TRUTH ON ANY PARTICULAR POINT IS ONE WHOEVER APPREHENDS THE TRUTH KNOWS ALL THAT ON THAT POINT CAN BE KNOWN
OR WITH SAVAGES AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN DRESS ITSELF THE FASHION WHICH PLEASED US TEN YEARS AGO AND WHICH MAY AGAIN PERHAPS BE RECEIVED INTO FAVOR BEFORE TEN YEARS HAVE GONE APPEARS TO US AT THIS MOMENT EXTRAVAGANT
UNTIL THEY AGREED ON THREE HUNDRED TALERS THEN THE PEASANT ONCE MORE PINCHED THE RAVEN'S HEAD TILL HE CROAKED LOUDLY THE MILLER ASKED WHAT DID HE SAY THE PEASANT REPLIED HE SAYS THAT THE DEVIL IS HIDING OUTSIDE THERE IN THE CLOSET ON THE PORCH THE MILLER SAID
AND WHEN THE OTHERS CAME HE DID NOT GIVE THEM SO MUCH AND SAID WHAT CAN I DO WITH ALL THESE SKINS THEN THE PEASANTS WERE VEXED THAT THE SMALL PEASANT SHOULD HAVE THUS OUTWITTED THEM WANTED TO TAKE VENGEANCE ON HIM AND ACCUSED HIM OF THIS TREACHERY BEFORE THE MAYOR
THIRDLY HE SAYS THAT THERE IS SOME SALAD ON THE BED THAT WOULD BE A FINE THING CRIED THE MILLER AND WENT THERE AND FOUND THE SALAD
COME AND EAT SOME MORE WITH ME THE PEASANT DID NOT REQUIRE TO BE INVITED TWICE BUT GOT UP AND ATE AFTER THIS THE MILLER SAW THE SKIN IN WHICH THE RAVEN WAS LYING ON THE GROUND AND ASKED WHAT HAVE YOU THERE THE PEASANT ANSWERED I HAVE A SOOTHSAYER INSIDE IT
BOTH THE CHILDREN WERE GONE THEN SHE WAS TERRIBLY ALARMED AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF
THE CAT HAD NO COUSIN AND HAD NOT BEEN ASKED TO BE GODMOTHER SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CHURCH STOLE TO THE POT OF FAT BEGAN TO LICK AT IT AND LICKED THE TOP OF THE FAT OFF THEN SHE TOOK A WALK UPON THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN LOOKED OUT FOR OPPORTUNITIES
AND YOU LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE BY YOURSELF YES YES ANSWERED THE MOUSE BY ALL MEANS GO AND IF YOU GET ANYTHING VERY GOOD TO EAT THINK OF ME I SHOULD LIKE A DROP OF SWEET RED CHRISTENING WINE MYSELF ALL THIS HOWEVER WAS UNTRUE
AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU FUNDEVOGEL SAID NEITHER NOW NOR EVER
AND YET HE AND HIS WIFE DID SO WISH TO HAVE ONE ONE DAY HE SAID TO HER LISTEN I HAVE A GOOD IDEA THERE IS OUR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER HE SHALL MAKE US A WOODEN CALF AND PAINT IT BROWN SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER AND IN TIME
AND DID NOT GO ONCE ONLY BUT MANY TIMES OUT TO THE SPRING LINA SAW THIS AND SAID LISTEN OLD SANNA WHY ARE YOU FETCHING SO MUCH WATER IF YOU WILL NEVER REPEAT IT TO ANYONE I WILL TELL YOU WHY SO LINA SAID NO
THE LITTLE PEASANT THERE WAS A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHEREIN NO ONE LIVED BUT REALLY RICH PEASANTS AND JUST ONE POOR ONE WHOM THEY CALLED THE LITTLE PEASANT HE HAD NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A COW AND STILL LESS MONEY TO BUY ONE
AND AS THEY WERE ENTERING THE VILLAGE THE SMALL PEASANT ALSO CAME QUIETLY IN DRIVING A FLOCK OF SHEEP AND LOOKING QUITE CONTENTED THEN THE PEASANTS WERE ASTONISHED AND SAID PEASANT FROM WHENCE DO YOU COME HAVE YOU COME OUT OF THE WATER YES TRULY REPLIED THE PEASANT
THERE IS SUCH A STORM IT LOOKS AS IF THE WORLD WERE COMING TO AN END THE MILLER SAW THE PEASANT LYING ON THE STRAW AND ASKED WHAT IS THAT FELLOW DOING THERE AH SAID THE WIFE THE POOR KNAVE CAME IN THE STORM AND RAIN AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER
THAT IS THE MOST SUSPICIOUS NAME OF ALL I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IN PRINT ALL GONE WHAT CAN THAT MEAN AND SHE SHOOK HER HEAD CURLED HERSELF UP AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP FROM THIS TIME FORTH NO ONE INVITED THE CAT TO BE GODMOTHER
FUNDEVOGEL THERE WAS ONCE A FORESTER WHO WENT INTO THE FOREST TO HUNT AND AS HE ENTERED IT HE HEARD A SOUND OF SCREAMING AS IF A LITTLE CHILD WERE THERE HE FOLLOWED THE SOUND AND AT LAST CAME TO A HIGH TREE AND AT THE TOP OF THIS A LITTLE CHILD WAS SITTING
THE MILLER'S WIFE WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE AND SAID TO THE PEASANT LAY YOURSELF ON THE STRAW THERE AND GAVE HIM A SLICE OF BREAD AND CHEESE THE PEASANT ATE IT AND LAY DOWN WITH HIS SKIN BESIDE HIM AND THE WOMAN THOUGHT HE IS TIRED AND HAS GONE TO SLEEP
THE MAN SAID I HAVE NO OBJECTION BUT BE QUICK AND GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT THE WOMAN SAID BUT I HAVE NOTHING BUT BREAD AND CHEESE I AM CONTENTED WITH ANYTHING REPLIED THE HUSBAND SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED BREAD AND CHEESE WILL DO AND LOOKED AT THE PEASANT AND SAID
YOU FOOLS WHY DID YOU NOT PULL THE CHURCH TO PIECES AND BRING THE CHANDELIER HOME WITH YOU AND NOW THE OLD COOK HERSELF GOT ON HER LEGS AND WENT WITH THE THREE SERVANTS IN PURSUIT OF THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW FROM AFAR THAT THE THREE SERVANTS WERE COMING
LAST NIGHT OLD SANNA CARRIED SO MANY BUCKETS OF WATER INTO THE HOUSE THAT I ASKED HER WHY SHE WAS DOING THAT AND SHE SAID THAT IF I WOULD PROMISE NOT TO TELL ANYONE AND SHE SAID THAT EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WHEN FATHER WAS OUT HUNTING SHE WOULD SET THE KETTLE FULL OF WATER
AND THE COOK WADDLING AFTER THEM THEN SAID LINA FUNDEVOGEL NEVER LEAVE ME AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU THEN SAID FUNDEVOGEL NEITHER NOW NOR EVER SAID LINA BE A FISHPOND AND I WILL BE THE DUCK UPON IT
THAN THAT IT WAS THE PEASANT WHO WAS SAYING THIS AND ANSWERED THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND BUT FIRST YOU SHALL LOOK ABOUT YOU A LITTLE DOWN BELOW THERE AND THEY ROLLED THE BARREL DOWN INTO THE WATER AFTER THAT THE PEASANTS WENT HOME
WHEREUPON THE PEASANTS CRIED WE ALREADY SEE THE SHEEP DOWN BELOW THE MAYOR PRESSED FORWARD AND SAID I WILL GO DOWN FIRST AND LOOK ABOUT ME AND IF THINGS PROMISE WELL I'LL CALL YOU
YOU SIT AT HOME SAID THE CAT IN YOUR DARK GREY FUR COAT AND LONG TAIL AND ARE FILLED WITH FANCIES THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DO NOT GO OUT IN THE DAYTIME DURING THE CAT'S ABSENCE THE MOUSE CLEANED THE HOUSE AND PUT IT IN ORDER BUT THE GREEDY CAT ENTIRELY EMPTIED THE POT OF FAT
I SANK DEEP DEEP DOWN UNTIL AT LAST I GOT TO THE BOTTOM
SHE WOULD NEVER REPEAT IT TO ANYONE AND THEN THE COOK SAID EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WHEN THE FORESTER IS OUT HUNTING I WILL HEAT THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS BOILING IN THE KETTLE I WILL THROW IN FUNDEVOGEL AND WILL BOIL HIM IN IT EARLY NEXT MORNING THE FORESTER GOT UP AND WENT OUT HUNTING
AS THE CHILD HAS A WHITE RING ROUND ITS NECK I CANNOT REFUSE THE GOOD MOUSE CONSENTED BUT THE CAT CREPT BEHIND THE TOWN WALLS TO THE CHURCH AND DEVOURED HALF THE POT OF FAT NOTHING EVER SEEMS SO GOOD AS WHAT ONE KEEPS TO ONESELF
ALL GONE WAS ALREADY ON THE POOR MOUSE'S LIPS
MY COUSIN HAS BROUGHT A LITTLE SON INTO THE WORLD AND HAS ASKED ME TO BE GODMOTHER HE IS WHITE WITH BROWN SPOTS AND I AM TO HOLD HIM OVER THE FONT AT THE CHRISTENING
YOU WILL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD ENJOY STICKING THAT DAINTY TONGUE OF YOURS OUT OF THE WINDOW THEY SET OUT ON THEIR WAY BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED THE POT OF FAT CERTAINLY WAS STILL IN ITS PLACE BUT IT WAS EMPTY ALAS SAID THE MOUSE NOW I SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW IT COMES TO LIGHT
MYSELF IN THE BARREL BUT I WILL NOT DO IT THE SHEPHERD SAID
AND THERE BEFORE THE HORRIFIED EYES OF ITS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE LAMB SUDDENLY AND VIOLENTLY GREW UP IT WAS THE MOST TERRIBLE MOMENT THE CHANGE WAS NOT SO SUDDEN AS THE WISH CHANGES USUALLY WERE THE BABY'S FACE CHANGED FIRST
THEY ALL WISHED SO HARD INDEED THAT THEY FELT QUITE GIDDY AND ALMOST LOST CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THE WISHING WAS QUITE VAIN FOR WHEN THE WOOD CEASED TO WHIRL ROUND THEIR DAZZLED EYES WERE RIVETED AT ONCE BY THE SPECTACLE OF A VERY PROPER LOOKING YOUNG MAN IN FLANNELS AND A STRAW HAT
SHE EXPLAINED TURNING TO THE LADY WHO WITH TREMBLING HANDS WAS NOW TURNING HER BICYCLE TOWARDS THE GATE AND WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF HIM AND WE MUST GET HIM HOME BEFORE SUNSET OR I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER WILL BECOME OF US YOU SEE HE'S SORT OF UNDER A SPELL ENCHANTED YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
IT WAS A GLOOMY PARTY THAT WENT HOME THROUGH THE SOFT EVENING DURING ANTHEA'S REMARKS ROBERT HAD AGAIN MADE PLAY WITH THE PIN AND THE BICYCLE TYRE AND THE LAMB WHOM THEY HAD TO CALL SAINT MAUR OR DEVEREUX OR HILARY
I SUPPOSE HE'LL BE GROWN UP SOME DAY ANTHEA WAS SAYING DREAMILY LOOKING UP AT THE BLUE OF THE SKY THAT SHOWED BETWEEN THE LONG STRAIGHT CHESTNUT LEAVES BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE LAMB
THERE WAS AND WHEN THE NUMBER OF PUNCTURES HAD BEEN MADE MANIFEST IT WAS FELT TO BE A SPECIAL BLESSING THAT THE COTTAGE PROVIDED TEAS FOR CYCLISTS IT PROVIDED AN ODD SORT OF TEA AND HAMMY MEAL FOR THE LAMB AND HIS BROTHERS
INTO THEIR OWN DEAR TIRESOME BABY BROTHER BUT HE IN HIS GROWN UPNESS INSISTED ON GOING ON AND THUS HE WAS MET IN THE FRONT GARDEN BY MARTHA NOW YOU REMEMBER THAT AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR
CYRIL HAD PERSUADED THE OTHERS TO AGREE TO HIS PLAN AND NOT TO WISH FOR ANYTHING MORE TILL THEY REALLY DID WISH IT MEANTIME IT SEEMED GOOD TO GO TO THE WOODS FOR NUTS AND ON THE MOSSY GRASS UNDER A SWEET CHESTNUT TREE THE FIVE WERE SITTING
A YOUNG MAN WHO WORE THE SAME LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE WHICH JUST BEFORE THEY HAD ACTUALLY SEEN GROWING UPON THE BABY'S LIP THIS THEN WAS THE LAMB GROWN UP THEIR OWN LAMB IT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT
IT FELL TO JANE'S LOT TO WAKEN THE GROWN UP LAMB SHE DID IT GENTLY BY TICKLING HIS NOSE WITH A TWIG OF WILD HONEYSUCKLE HE SAID
HE WON'T STAND OUR LOOKING AFTER HIM AND IF HE'S STILL A BABY INSIDE OF HIM HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO GET HIM TO DO ANYTHING AND IT'LL BE GETTING ON FOR DINNER TIME IN A MINUTE
BECAUSE IT SEEMED SO UNFAIR THAT THE BABY WHO HAD ONLY THAT MORNING DESTROYED TWO CHEAP BUT HONEST WATCHES SHOULD NOW IN THE GROWN UPNESS CYRIL'S FOLLY HAD RAISED HIM TO HAVE A REAL GOLD WATCH WITH A CHAIN AND SEALS HILARY AS I WILL NOW TERM HIM
A PUNCTURE HE WAS SAYING CAN I NOT BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU COULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A STIFLED EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER BEHIND THE PIG PAIL THE GROWN UP LAMB OTHERWISE DEVEREUX TURNED THE TAIL OF AN ANGRY EYE IN ITS DIRECTION
YES YOU WILL MY LAMB SAID ANTHEA UNDER HER BREATH BUT IT WON'T BE AT ALL THE SORT OF THING YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN HER HEART SHE COULD HEAR THE PRETTY SOFT LITTLE LOVING VOICE OF THE BABY LAMB SO DIFFERENT FROM THE AFFECTED TONES OF THE DREADFUL GROWN UP LAMB
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME SINCE PEOPLE LEFT OFF EATING REALLY WHOLESOME THINGS HOWEVER HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY GOOD BYE GOOD BYE SAID CYRIL POLITELY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE WISHES OF THE CHILDREN THEREFORE MARTHA MERELY SAW THE USUAL PARTY WITH THE BABY LAMB ABOUT WHOM SHE HAD BEEN DESPERATELY ANXIOUS ALL THE AFTERNOON TROTTING BESIDE ANTHEA ON FAT BABY LEGS WHILE THE CHILDREN OF COURSE STILL SAW THE GROWN UP LAMB
OR HAD HIS MIND GROWN UP TOGETHER WITH HIS BODY THAT WAS THE QUESTION WHICH THE OTHERS IN A HURRIED COUNCIL HELD AMONG THE YELLOWING BRACKEN A FEW YARDS FROM THE SLEEPER DEBATED EAGERLY WHICHEVER IT IS IT'LL BE JUST AS AWFUL SAID ANTHEA IF HIS INSIDE SENSES ARE GROWN UP TOO
THE GROWN UP LAMB MOVED GRACEFULLY ACROSS THE MOSS AND SETTLED HIMSELF AGAINST THE TRUNK OF THE SWEET CHESTNUT HE TILTED THE STRAW HAT OVER HIS EYES HE WAS EVIDENTLY WEARY HE WAS GOING TO SLEEP THE LAMB THE ORIGINAL LITTLE TIRESOME BELOVED LAMB
THEIR BEDS SPEAKING GLANCES FLASHED BETWEEN THE WRETCHED FOUR MUCH BED THERE WOULD BE FOR THEM IF THEY WENT HOME WITHOUT THE LAMB WE PROMISED MOTHER NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF YOU IF WE TOOK YOU OUT
I SELDOM PLAY
RUN ALONG HOME LIKE GOOD CHILDREN THE POSITION WAS DESPERATE
NOT IF I CAN STOP IT WE MUST TAME HIM BY KINDNESS SAID JANE YOU SEE SAID ROBERT IF HE GROWS UP IN THE USUAL WAY
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUDDENLY SEE A POOR LITTLE HELPLESS BABY SPINNING ALONG DOWNHILL BESIDE YOU WITH ITS FEET UP ON A BICYCLE IT HAD LOST CONTROL OF THE LADY HAD TURNED RATHER PALE WHO ARE THESE VERY DIRTY CHILDREN SHE ASKED THE GROWN UP LAMB
YOU'RE VERY KIND SAID THE LADY LOOKING AT THE LAMB SHE LOOKED RATHER SHY BUT AS THE BOYS PUT IT THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY NONSENSE ABOUT HER BUT OH WHISPERED CYRIL BEHIND THE PIG PAIL I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE'D HAD ENOUGH BICYCLE MENDING FOR ONE DAY
YOUR BIKE'S RUN DOWN SAID ROBERT WONDERING HOW HE COULD SO SOON HAVE LEARNED TO DECEIVE SO IT IS SAID CYRIL IT'S A PUNCTURE SAID ANTHEA STOOPING DOWN AND STANDING UP AGAIN WITH A THORN WHICH SHE HAD GOT READY FOR THE PURPOSE LOOK HERE
AND IF SHE ONLY KNEW THAT REALLY AND TRULY HE'S ONLY A WHINY PINY SILLY LITTLE BABY HE'S NOT ANTHEA MURMURED ANGRILY HE'S A DEAR IF PEOPLE ONLY LET HIM ALONE IT'S OUR OWN PRECIOUS LAMB STILL WHATEVER SILLY IDIOTS MAY TURN HIM INTO ISN'T HE PUSSY
I WISH TO GOODNESS HE WOULD OH TAKE CARE CRIED ANTHEA IN AN AGONY OF APPREHENSION BUT IT WAS TOO LATE LIKE MUSIC TO A SONG HER WORDS AND CYRIL'S CAME OUT TOGETHER ANTHEA OH TAKE CARE CYRIL GROW UP NOW
SHOOTING OUT ITS LONG SNAIL'S EYES I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU ALL OF YOU YOU HAVE NO MORE SENSE THAN SO MANY OYSTERS GO ALONG WITH YOU AND CYRIL WENT WHAT AN AWFUL LONG TIME BABIES STAY BABIES
SOMETIMES CALLED SAINT MAUR IN THESE PAGES I DON'T KNOW HE LIED MISERABLY
AND WE'LL GO ON THE RIVER AFTERWARDS I'M INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU SAID THE LAMB COURTEOUSLY BUT I SHOULD PREFER SOLITUDE GO HOME TO YOUR LUNCH I MEAN YOUR DINNER PERHAPS I MAY LOOK IN ABOUT TEA TIME
THAT NEVER EXPLAINED SCIENCE WHICH WAS THRUST AS AN EXTINGUISHER OVER ALL HER LIGHTS BUT YOU ARE FOND OF RIDING MISS BROOKE SIR JAMES PRESENTLY TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENTER A LITTLE INTO THE PLEASURES OF HUNTING
EXCEPT INDEED IN A RELIGIOUS SORT OF WAY
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN HOW CAPTAIN DOBBIN BOUGHT A PIANO IF THERE IS ANY EXHIBITION IN ALL VANITY FAIR WHICH SATIRE AND SENTIMENT CAN VISIT ARM IN ARM TOGETHER WHERE YOU LIGHT ON THE STRANGEST CONTRASTS
HIS SECLUDED WIFE EVER SMILING AND CHEERFUL HIS LITTLE COMFORTABLE LODGINGS SNUG MEALS AND HOMELY EVENINGS HAD ALL THE CHARMS OF NOVELTY AND SECRECY THE MARRIAGE WAS NOT YET DECLARED TO THE WORLD
ENTERPRISING YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS ARE MEASURING THE LOOKING GLASSES AND HANGINGS
AND SPOKE WITH COLD BRUSQUERIE VERY MUCH WITH THE AIR OF A HANDSOME BOY IN AMUSING CONTRAST WITH THE SOLICITOUS AMIABILITY OF HER ADMIRER I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR REASONS FOR THIS CRUEL RESOLUTION
CERTAINLY SAID GOOD SIR JAMES
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE DID NOT PURCHASE THE INSTRUMENT FOR HIS OWN USE IN A WORD IT ARRIVED THAT EVENING AT A WONDERFUL SMALL COTTAGE IN A STREET LEADING FROM THE FULHAM ROAD ONE OF THOSE STREETS WHICH HAVE THE FINEST ROMANTIC NAMES THIS WAS CALLED SAINT ADELAIDE VILLAS
EXCUSE ME I HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE PRACTICE AND I SHOULD BE EASILY THROWN THEN THAT IS A REASON FOR MORE PRACTICE EVERY LADY OUGHT TO BE A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN THAT SHE MAY ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND
THE JUNIOR OF THE HOUSE WHO PURCHASED THE SPOONS FOR THE FIRM WAS IN FACT VERY SWEET UPON AMELIA AND OFFERED FOR HER IN SPITE OF ALL HE MARRIED MISS LOUISA CUTTS DAUGHTER OF HIGHAM AND CUTTS THE EMINENT CORNFACTORS
SHE HAD REFLECTED THAT DODO WOULD PERHAPS NOT MAKE A HUSBAND HAPPY WHO HAD NOT HER WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND STIFLED IN THE DEPTHS OF HER HEART WAS THE FEELING THAT HER SISTER WAS TOO RELIGIOUS FOR FAMILY COMFORT NOTIONS AND SCRUPLES WERE LIKE SPILT NEEDLES
THE HEBREW AIDE DE CAMP IN THE SERVICE OF THE OFFICER AT THE TABLE BID AGAINST THE HEBREW GENTLEMAN EMPLOYED BY THE ELEPHANT PURCHASERS AND A BRISK BATTLE ENSUED OVER THIS LITTLE PIANO THE COMBATANTS BEING GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY MISTER HAMMERDOWN AT LAST
WAS EVIDENTLY AND QUICKLY SMITTEN BY MISSUS CRAWLEY BUT HER OWN CIRCUMSPECTION AND MODESTY NEVER FORSOOK HER FOR A MOMENT AND CRAWLEY'S REPUTATION AS A FIRE EATING AND JEALOUS WARRIOR WAS A FURTHER AND COMPLETE DEFENCE TO HIS LITTLE WIFE
THE EXCELLENT DRAWING ROOM FURNITURE BY THE BEST MAKERS THE RARE AND FAMOUS WINES SELECTED REGARDLESS OF COST AND WITH THE WELL KNOWN TASTE OF THE PURCHASER THE RICH AND COMPLETE SET OF FAMILY PLATE HAD BEEN SOLD ON THE PREVIOUS DAYS
RECOLLECTING IT IN OLD DAYS WHEN SHE USED TO PLAY UPON IT IN THE LITTLE SITTING ROOM OF OUR DEAR AMELIA SEDLEY THE SALE WAS AT THE OLD HOUSE IN RUSSELL SQUARE
HE AT THE TABLE LOOKED MORE SURPRISED AND DISCOMPOSED THAN EVER WHEN HE SPIED THIS PAIR AND HIS HEAD SANK INTO HIS MILITARY COLLAR AND HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THEM SO AS TO AVOID THEM ALTOGETHER
MISTER CASAUBON HAD COME UP TO THE TABLE TEACUP IN HAND AND WAS LISTENING WE MUST NOT INQUIRE TOO CURIOUSLY INTO MOTIVES HE INTERPOSED IN HIS MEASURED WAY
IT HAPPENED THAT THE ORATOR ON THE TABLE WAS EXPATIATING ON THE MERITS OF A PICTURE WHICH HE SOUGHT TO RECOMMEND TO HIS AUDIENCE IT WAS BY NO MEANS SO SELECT OR NUMEROUS A COMPANY AS HAD ATTENDED THE PREVIOUS DAYS OF THE AUCTION
AND PRONOUNCE HIM A GOOD NATURED JOVIAL RECKLESS FELLOW
THE CAPTAIN HAD VANISHED AND SUCH INFORMATION AS THEY GOT WAS FROM A STRAY PORTER OR BROKER AT THE AUCTION LOOK AT THEM WITH THEIR HOOKED BEAKS BECKY SAID GETTING INTO THE BUGGY HER PICTURE UNDER HER ARM IN GREAT GLEE THEY'RE LIKE VULTURES AFTER A BATTLE DON'T KNOW
WITH A SENSATION AND INTEREST NOT A LITTLE STARTLING AND QUEER OF THE DAY WHEN THEIR TURN SHALL COME TOO
SENT THIS LITTLE SPAR OUT OF THE WRECK WITH THEIR LOVE TO GOOD MISSUS SEDLEY AND WITH RESPECT TO THE PIANO AS IT HAD BEEN AMELIA'S AND AS SHE MIGHT MISS IT AND WANT ONE NOW AND AS CAPTAIN WILLIAM DOBBIN COULD NO MORE PLAY UPON IT THAN HE COULD DANCE ON THE TIGHT ROPE
OR PUBLISHED IN THE MORNING POST ALL HIS CREDITORS WOULD HAVE COME RUSHING ON HIM IN A BODY HAD THEY KNOWN THAT HE WAS UNITED TO A WOMAN WITHOUT FORTUNE
AND GIVE THEM DRAINING TILES YOU KNOW BUT YOUR FANCY FARMING WILL NOT DO THE MOST EXPENSIVE SORT OF WHISTLE YOU CAN BUY YOU MAY AS WELL KEEP A PACK OF HOUNDS
MY LORD DIVES'S REMAINS ARE IN THE FAMILY VAULT THE STATUARIES ARE CUTTING AN INSCRIPTION VERACIOUSLY COMMEMORATING HIS VIRTUES AND THE SORROWS OF HIS HEIR WHO IS DISPOSING OF HIS GOODS
EXACTLY SAID SIR JAMES
IS NOTHING BUT A MAN ON A GRAY ASS LIKE MY OWN WHO CARRIES SOMETHING SHINY ON HIS HEAD JUST SO ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE AND THAT RESPLENDENT OBJECT IS THE HELMET OF MAMBRINO
WHEN HE STAYED AT HOME SHE PLAYED AND SANG FOR HIM MADE HIM GOOD DRINKS SUPERINTENDED HIS DINNER WARMED HIS SLIPPERS AND STEEPED HIS SOUL IN COMFORT THE BEST OF WOMEN I HAVE HEARD MY GRANDMOTHER SAY ARE HYPOCRITES
AND EVEN HIS IGNORANCE IS OF A SOUNDER QUALITY SIR JAMES MIGHT NOT HAVE ORIGINATED THIS ESTIMATE BUT A KIND PROVIDENCE FURNISHES THE LIMPEST PERSONALITY WITH A LITTLE GUM OR STARCH IN THE FORM OF TRADITION
HIS GUN IN HIS HAND IS GOING TO THE CHASE IN THE DISTANCE A BANYHANN TREE AND A PAGODY MOST LIKELY RESEMBLANCES OF SOME INTERESTING SPOT IN OUR FAMOUS EASTERN POSSESSIONS HOW MUCH FOR THIS LOT COME GENTLEMEN
DO YOU KNOW WILBERFORCE MISTER CASAUBON SAID NO WELL WILBERFORCE WAS PERHAPS NOT ENOUGH OF A THINKER BUT IF I WENT INTO PARLIAMENT
SO LITTLE PAINS DO THE VULGAR TAKE IN THE INVESTIGATION OF TRUTH ACCEPTING READILY THE FIRST STORY THAT COMES TO HAND ON THE WHOLE HOWEVER THE CONCLUSIONS I HAVE DRAWN FROM THE PROOFS QUOTED MAY I BELIEVE SAFELY BE RELIED ON
BORN LONG AFTER THE TROJAN WAR HE NOWHERE CALLS ALL OF THEM BY THAT NAME NOR INDEED ANY OF THEM EXCEPT THE FOLLOWERS OF ACHILLES FROM PHTHIOTIS WHO WERE THE ORIGINAL HELLENES
THE GREAT CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONAL CHARACTERS A CONTRAST OF WHICH AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE YOU HAVE LITTLE PERCEPTION HAVING NEVER YET CONSIDERED WHAT SORT OF ANTAGONISTS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER IN THE ATHENIANS HOW WIDELY
AND HERE IS NO INCONSIDERABLE EXEMPLIFICATION OF MY ASSERTION THAT THE MIGRATIONS WERE THE CAUSE OF THERE BEING NO CORRESPONDENT GROWTH IN OTHER PARTS THE MOST POWERFUL VICTIMS OF WAR OR FACTION
HAVING NOW GIVEN THE RESULT OF MY INQUIRIES INTO EARLY TIMES I GRANT THAT THERE WILL BE A DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING EVERY PARTICULAR DETAIL THE WAY THAT MOST MEN DEAL WITH TRADITIONS EVEN TRADITIONS OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY
SUBSEQUENTLY THE IONIANS ATTAINED TO GREAT NAVAL STRENGTH IN THE REIGN OF CYRUS THE FIRST KING OF THE PERSIANS AND OF HIS SON CAMBYSES
THIS BELIEF WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS GROUNDS THE PREPARATIONS OF BOTH THE COMBATANTS
TO MISTRUST EVEN WHAT IS SANCTIONED BY YOUR JUDGMENT AND TO FANCY THAT FROM DANGER THERE IS NO RELEASE FURTHER THERE IS PROMPTITUDE ON THEIR SIDE AGAINST PROCRASTINATION ON YOURS THEY ARE NEVER AT HOME YOU ARE NEVER FROM IT
MOST OF THE PELOPONNESE ARCADIA EXCEPTED AND THE MOST FERTILE PARTS OF THE REST OF HELLAS THE GOODNESS OF THE LAND FAVOURED THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS AND THUS CREATED FACTION WHICH PROVED A FERTILE SOURCE OF RUIN
AND HELLAS BEGAN TO FIT OUT FLEETS AND APPLY HERSELF MORE CLOSELY TO THE SEA IT IS SAID THAT THE CORINTHIANS WERE THE FIRST TO APPROACH THE MODERN STYLE OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE AND THAT CORINTH WAS THE FIRST PLACE IN HELLAS WHERE GALLEYS WERE BUILT
THEY SEEM TO HAVE TURNED TO CULTIVATION OF THE CHERSONESE AND TO PIRACY FROM WANT OF SUPPLIES THIS WAS WHAT REALLY ENABLED THE TROJANS TO KEEP THE FIELD FOR TEN YEARS AGAINST THEM THE DISPERSION OF THE ENEMY MAKING THEM ALWAYS A MATCH FOR THE DETACHMENT LEFT BEHIND
WHAT ENABLED AGAMEMNON TO RAISE THE ARMAMENT WAS MORE IN MY OPINION HIS SUPERIORITY IN STRENGTH THAN THE OATHS OF TYNDAREUS WHICH BOUND THE SUITORS TO FOLLOW HIM
AND TO ADOPT AN EASIER AND MORE LUXURIOUS MODE OF LIFE INDEED IT IS ONLY LATELY THAT THEIR RICH OLD MEN LEFT OFF THE LUXURY OF WEARING UNDERGARMENTS OF LINEN AND FASTENING A KNOT OF THEIR HAIR WITH A TIE OF GOLDEN GRASSHOPPERS
SO MY HABIT HAS BEEN TO MAKE THE SPEAKERS SAY WHAT WAS IN MY OPINION DEMANDED OF THEM BY THE VARIOUS OCCASIONS OF COURSE ADHERING AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO THE GENERAL SENSE OF WHAT THEY REALLY SAID AND WITH REFERENCE TO THE NARRATIVE OF EVENTS
PUBLICLY STRIPPING AND ANOINTING THEMSELVES WITH OIL IN THEIR GYMNASTIC EXERCISES FORMERLY EVEN IN THE OLYMPIC CONTESTS THE ATHLETES WHO CONTENDED WORE BELTS ACROSS THEIR MIDDLES AND IT IS BUT A FEW YEARS SINCE THAT THE PRACTICE CEASED
OR OF ANY VIGOROUS ACTION OF THEIR OWN BUT AT LAST A TIME CAME WHEN THE TYRANTS OF ATHENS AND THE FAR OLDER TYRANNIES OF THE REST OF HELLAS WERE
A FASHION WHICH SPREAD TO THEIR IONIAN KINDRED AND LONG PREVAILED AMONG THE OLD MEN THERE
ALLIES AMONG WHOM WE HAVE NOT THE WORST TITLE TO SPEAK AS HAVING THE GREATEST COMPLAINTS TO MAKE COMPLAINTS OF ATHENIAN OUTRAGE AND LACEDAEMONIAN NEGLECT NOW IF THESE ASSAULTS ON THE RIGHTS OF HELLAS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE DARK
AND LEAD THE WHOLE NOT TO SPEAK OF THEIR NUMEROUS ALLIES WITHOUT STILL AS THE CITY IS NEITHER BUILT IN A COMPACT FORM NOR ADORNED WITH MAGNIFICENT TEMPLES AND PUBLIC EDIFICES BUT COMPOSED OF VILLAGES AFTER THE OLD FASHION OF HELLAS
ON OTHER BUSINESS ON HEARING THE SPEECHES THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES CALLED UPON TO COME BEFORE THE LACEDAEMONIANS
NOT MANY YEARS AFTER THE DEPOSITION OF THE TYRANTS THE BATTLE OF MARATHON WAS FOUGHT BETWEEN THE MEDES AND THE ATHENIANS TEN YEARS AFTERWARDS THE BARBARIAN RETURNED WITH THE ARMADA FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF HELLAS
WE HAVE THEREFORE NO RIGHT TO BE SCEPTICAL NOR TO CONTENT OURSELVES WITH AN INSPECTION OF A TOWN TO THE EXCLUSION OF A CONSIDERATION OF ITS POWER BUT WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT THE ARMAMENT IN QUESTION SURPASSED ALL BEFORE IT
AND IT WAS AT A SOMEWHAT LATER STAGE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT
AND CORINTHIAN AND PELOPONNESIAN CITIZENS WITHIN IT WERE BEING BESIEGED THAT OF ATHENS AGAINST THE PELOPONNESIANS THAT THEY HAD INCITED A TOWN OF HERS A MEMBER OF HER ALLIANCE AND A CONTRIBUTOR TO HER REVENUE TO REVOLT
IT WAS QUITE AT THE END OF THIS PERIOD THAT THE WAR WITH AEGINA AND THE PROSPECT OF THE BARBARIAN INVASION ENABLED THEMISTOCLES TO PERSUADE THE ATHENIANS TO BUILD THE FLEET WITH WHICH THEY FOUGHT AT SALAMIS
BUT THE OLD TOWNS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT PREVALENCE OF PIRACY WERE BUILT AWAY FROM THE SEA WHETHER ON THE ISLANDS OR THE CONTINENT AND STILL REMAIN IN THEIR OLD SITES FOR THE PIRATES USED TO PLUNDER ONE ANOTHER
BESIDES HIS POWER SEEMED CONSIDERABLE AND HE HAD NOT NEGLECTED TO COURT THE FAVOUR OF THE POPULACE AND ASSUMED THE SCEPTRE OF MYCENAE
AND THUS DID HIS BEST TO PUT DOWN PIRACY IN THOSE WATERS A NECESSARY STEP TO SECURE THE REVENUES FOR HIS OWN USE
VARIOUS TOO WERE THE OBSTACLES WHICH THE NATIONAL GROWTH ENCOUNTERED IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES THE POWER OF THE IONIANS WAS ADVANCING WITH RAPID STRIDES WHEN IT CAME INTO COLLISION WITH PERSIA UNDER KING CYRUS WHO AFTER HAVING DETHRONED CROESUS
HELD THEIR ORDINARY ASSEMBLY AND INVITED THEM TO SPEAK THERE WERE MANY WHO CAME FORWARD AND MADE THEIR SEVERAL ACCUSATIONS AMONG THEM THE MEGARIANS IN A LONG LIST OF GRIEVANCES CALLED SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE FACT OF THEIR EXCLUSION FROM THE PORTS OF THE ATHENIAN EMPIRE
IN DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLITICS TIME AFTER TIME WAS OUR VOICE RAISED TO WARN YOU OF THE BLOWS ABOUT TO BE DEALT US BY ATHENS AND TIME AFTER TIME INSTEAD OF TAKING THE TROUBLE TO ASCERTAIN THE WORTH OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS
POLISHED A THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND STILL SHINING TOWARDS THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN YOU NOTE THE DWARFING OF THE TREES UNTIL AT A HEIGHT OF ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET YOU FIND PATCHES OF THE TOUGH WHITE BARKED PINE
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN GO FAR ENOUGH DOWN THE NORTH SIDE FOR A VIEW OF THE DANA GLACIER
AND THE COAST RANGES HAZY AND DIM IN THE DISTANCE FROM GLACIER POINT GO DOWN THE TRAIL INTO THE LOWER END OF THE ILLILOUETTE BASIN CROSS ILLILOUETTE CREEK AND FOLLOW IT TO THE FALL
THENCE BY THE SUNRISE TRAIL TO CATHEDRAL PEAK VISITING THE BEAUTIFUL CATHEDRAL LAKE WHICH LIES ABOUT A MILE TO THE WEST OF CATHEDRAL PEAK EATING YOUR LUNCHEON AND THENCE TO CLOUDS REST AND THE VALLEY AS ABOVE
AWAKENING THE LAKES AND CRYSTALS
COMBINED WITH INEFFABLE FINENESS OF BEAUTY DRAGGING YOURSELF AWAY GO TO THE HEAD OF THE RIBBON FALL THENCE ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL RIBBON CREEK BASIN TO THE BIG OAK FLAT STAGE ROAD
SEPARATED BY CANYONS AND DARKENED WITH LINES AND FIELDS OF FOREST CATHEDRAL PEAK AND MOUNT HOFFMAN IN THE DISTANCE SMALL LAKES AND INNUMERABLE MEADOWS IN THE FOREGROUND
THE BEST THREE DAY EXCURSION AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST OF THE TWO DAY TRIPS UNTIL YOU REACH LAKE TENAYA
TO ANY ONE NOT DESPERATELY TIME POOR THIS TRIP SHOULD HAVE FOUR DAYS INSTEAD OF THREE CAMPING THE SECOND NIGHT AT THE SODA SPRINGS
WAS FROM TWELVE TO FOURTEEN FEET WIDE THE MELTING SNOW AND ICE FORMED A NETWORK OF RILLS THAT RAN GRACEFULLY DOWN THE SURFACE OF THE GLACIER MERRILY SINGING IN THEIR SHINING CHANNELS
NARROW STRIPS OF PINE WOODS CROSS THE MEADOW CARPET FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND IT IS SOMEWHAT ROUGHENED HERE AND THERE BY MORAINE BOULDERS AND DEAD TREES BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE HEIGHTS BY SNOW AVALANCHES
NO MOUNTAIN TOP COULD BE BETTER PLACED FOR THIS MOST GLORIOUS OF MOUNTAIN VIEWS TO WATCH AND SEE THE DEEPENING COLORS OF THE DAWN AND THE SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE SNOWY HIGH SIERRA PASSES
THE SOD IN MOST PLACES IS EXCEEDINGLY FINE AND SILKY AND FREE FROM WEEDS AND BUSHES WHILE CHARMING FLOWERS ABOUND ESPECIALLY GENTIANS DWARF DAISIES POTENTILLAS
SOME SPECIMENS THAT I MEASURED WERE OVER A HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND TWENTY FOUR FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SHOWING HARDLY A TRACE OF SEVERE STORMS LOOKING AS FRESH AND VIGOROUS AS THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER ZONES
AND GREATER THAN ALL THE STUPENDOUS SCENERY INTO THE HEART OF WHICH THE WHITE PASSIONATE RIVER GOES WILDLY THUNDERING SURPASSING EVERYTHING OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD AFTER AN UNMEASURED HOUR OR SO OF THIS GLORY
THE ICE APPEARED ON ALL THE LOWER PORTION OF THE GLACIER FARTHER UP IT WAS COVERED WITH SNOW
YOU SAUNTER AMONG THE CRYSTALS AND FLOWERS AS IF YOU WERE WALKING AMONG STARS FROM THE SUMMIT NEARLY ALL THE YOSEMITE PARK IS DISPLAYED LIKE A MAP
THE HEAD OF THE RIBBON FALL ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL RIBBON CREEK BASIN AND BACK TO THE VALLEY BY THE BIG OAK FLAT WAGON ROAD
EVENING CAME ON JUST AS I GOT FAIRLY INTO THE MAIN CANYON IT IS ABOUT A MILE WIDE AND A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO MILES LONG
PERHAPS THE BEST ALL ROUND EXCURSION TIME AFTER WINTERS OF AVERAGE SNOWFALL IS FROM THE MIDDLE OF JULY TO THE MIDDLE OR END OF AUGUST THE SNOW IS THEN MELTED FROM THE WOODS AND SOUTHERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS AND THE MEADOWS AND GARDENS
DRINKING THE THIN SUNSHINE AND MATURING THEIR FINE PURPLE CONES AS IF THEY MEANT TO LIVE FOREVER THE GENERAL VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND SUBLIME TO BE FOUND IN ALL THE RANGE
BOUNDED BY ITS SNOWY PEAKS IN GLORIOUS ARRAY SOUTHWARD YOSEMITE AND WESTWARD THE VAST FOREST ON NO OTHER YOSEMITE PARK MOUNTAIN ARE YOU MORE LIKELY TO LINGER YOU WILL FIND IT A MAGNIFICENT SKY CAMP
TO THE VALLEY IN GOOD TIME PROVIDED YOU LEFT YOUR HOFFMAN SKY CAMP EARLY TWO DAY EXCURSIONS
THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE YOSEMITE VALLEY AND ITS MANY DOMES THE STARR KING CLUSTER OF DOMES SENTINEL DOME GLACIER POINT AND PERHAPS THE MOST TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSIVE OF ALL
MAGNIFICENT VIEWS ARE OBTAINED AS YOU APPROACH IT AND PASS THROUGH ITS SPRAY THOUGH WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST YOU WILL BE WELL DRENCHED FROM THE FOOT OF THE FALL THE TRAIL ZIGZAGS UP A NARROW CANYON
HAVE AT AN ELEVATION OF TEN THOUSAND FEET ONLY SMALL BROWN MATS OF CAREX LEAVING BARE ROCKS AROUND MORE THAN HALF THEIR SHORES YET
AND IF CURIOUS ABOUT SUCH THINGS YOU MAY DISCOVER SPECIMENS OF THIS HARDY TREE MOUNTAINEER NOT MORE THAN FOUR FEET HIGH AND ABOUT AS MANY INCHES IN DIAMETER AT THE GROUND
GILIAS PHLOXES MIMULUS ET CETERA MANY OF THEM WITH MORE PETALS THAN LEAVES ON THE BORDERS OF LITTLE STREAMS LARGER PLANTS FLOURISH LUPINES DAISIES ASTERS GOLDENRODS
AND DOWN ITS FINE GRADES TO THE VALLEY ENJOYING GLORIOUS YOSEMITE SCENERY ALL THE WAY TO THE FOOT OF EL CAPITAN AND YOUR CAMP TWO DAY EXCURSIONS
TO THE EASTWARD YOU GAZE FAR OUT OVER THE DESERT PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT BASIN RANGE BEYOND RANGE EXTENDING WITH SOFT OUTLINES BLUE AND PURPLE IN THE DISTANCE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND FEET BELOW YOU LIES LAKE MONO
AND THAT GIOVANNI POSSESSED SEVERAL QUALITIES FAR SURPASSING THOSE OF SALVESTRO THE ASSOCIATES OF NICCOLO WERE UNINFLUENCED BY HIS REMARKS FOR THEY WERE JEALOUS OF HIS REPUTATION AND DESIRED TO EXALT SOME PERSON
ESTEEMED THEM THE LESS AND THEREFORE HAD THE LESS OCCASION TO GRIEVE FOR THEIR ABSENCE THE OTHER TAKING THEM FROM THOSE WHO BEING ACCUSTOMED TO THEIR POSSESSION
THE GOOD SOUL HAD VENTURED SOUTH AND TRIED TO BUY HER MOTHER BUT OLE MISSIS WOULD NOT LET HER GO AT ANY PRICE AND THE FAITHFUL CHATTEL WOULD NOT RUN AWAY
SO A FAREWELL FESTIVAL WAS HELD AND CHRISTIE WENT TO IT FEELING MORE SOLITARY THAN EVER AS SHE BADE HER OLD FRIENDS A LONG GOOD BYE THE REST OF THE MONEY BURNED IN HER POCKET
AND ADVISED THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF RELIEF BUT THEIR ADVICE WAS REJECTED IN THE COUNCILS THEREFORE TO RENDER THE LAW AS OFFENSIVE AS POSSIBLE
SENT AMBASSADORS TO THE CITY TO INTIMATE THAT HE WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT THE SUSPICIONS THEY ENTERTAINED AND OFFERED TO REVOKE WHATEVER HE HAD DONE
WITH A MUTE ELOQUENCE SHE COULD NOT RESIST IN VAIN DID RACHEL ANSWER HER WITH QUIET COLDNESS NOD SILENTLY WHEN SHE WISHED HER A CHEERY GOOD MORNING AND KEEP RESOLUTELY IN HER OWN SOMEWHAT ISOLATED CORNER
WHILE THE FORMER BRINGS ALIKE GRATIFICATION AND PROFIT THEN DIRECTING HIS DISCOURSE MORE PARTICULARLY TO RINALDO HE SAID
SO FREELY OFFERED IT CHRISTIE WAS SURE OF THIS
THEY HIRED COUNT ALBERIGO WHO FROM ZAGONARA HIS OWN DOMAIN OVERRAN THE COUNTRY DAILY UP TO THE GATES OF IMOLA AGNOLO DELLA PERGOLA
AND WAGES WERE THE THREE TOPICS WHICH ABSORBED THEM CHRISTIE SOON TIRED OF THE INNUMERABLE CHANGES RUNG UPON THESE THEMES
BUT NONE FELT IT SO SEVERELY AS THE NOBILITY WHO HAD BEEN IN FAVOR OF THE WAR FOR THEY PERCEIVED THEIR ENEMIES TO BE INSPIRITED AND THEMSELVES DISARMED WITHOUT FRIENDS AND OPPOSED BY THE PEOPLE
WHO ESTABLISHES ORDINANCES CAPABLE OF APPEASING OR RESTRAINING THESE CONTENDING DISPOSITIONS SO AS TO PREVENT THEM FROM DOING MISCHIEF THEN THE GOVERNMENT MAY BE CALLED FREE AND
BUT THESE ADVANTAGES ARE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN DENIED TO THOSE WHICH FREQUENTLY CHANGE FROM TYRANNY TO LICENSE OR THE REVERSE BECAUSE
AND AN INTENSE FROST HAVING RENDERED THE DITCHES OF THE CITY PASSABLE HE CROSSED THEM DURING THE NIGHT CAPTURED THE PLACE AND SENT LODOVICO A PRISONER TO MILAN
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE GAVE SO MUCH GRATIFICATION TO THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE THE MULTITUDE THINKING THEY HAD NOW FOUND A DEFENDER THAT NOT WITHOUT OCCASION THE JUDICIOUS OF THE PARTY OBSERVED IT WITH JEALOUSY
AND WOULD SOON IF NOT RESTRAINED BY GREATER FORCE OR BETTER REGULATIONS APPOINT THE MAGISTRATES WHO
AND AS IN THE TREATY WHICH FILIPPO MADE WITH THE DOGE OF GENOA
IN THE FORMER THE INSOLENT HAVE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY AND IN THE LATTER THE FOOLISH
RINALDO DEGLI ALBIZZI ADDRESSES AN ASSEMBLY OF CITIZENS AND ADVISES THE RESTORATION OF THE GRANDI
UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF FILIPPO THE BOY'S MOTHER SUSPICIOUS OF HIS GUARDIAN SENT HIM TO LODOVICO ALIDOSSI HER FATHER WHO WAS LORD OF IMOLA BUT SHE WAS COMPELLED
DESCRIBING THE CONDITION OF THE CITY AND SHOWING HOW BY THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE IT HAD AGAIN FALLEN UNDER THE POWER OF THE PLEBEIANS FROM WHOM IT HAD BEEN WRESTED BY THEIR FATHERS IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
SOME A FATHER OTHERS A GRANDFATHER PUT TO DEATH BY ITS TYRANNY HE ASSURED THEM THEY WERE NOW IN THE SAME DANGER AND THAT THE CITY WAS SINKING UNDER THE SAME DISORDERS
AND TO MAKE ALL SENSIBLE OF ITS INJUSTICE THEY CONTRIVED THAT THE TAXES SHOULD BE LEVIED WITH THE UTMOST RIGOR AND MADE IT LAWFUL TO KILL ANY THAT MIGHT RESIST THE OFFICERS EMPLOYED TO COLLECT THEM
HER EVENINGS AT HOME WERE DEVOTED TO BOOKS FOR SHE HAD THE TRUE NEW ENGLAND WOMAN'S DESIRE FOR EDUCATION AND READ OR STUDIED FOR THE LOVE OF IT THUS SHE HAD MUCH TO THINK OF AS HER NEEDLE FLEW
THE FLORENTINES MURMUR AGAINST THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ADVOCATES OF THE WAR
AND THEN BY THOSE OF NICCOLO DA UZZANO THE CITY REMAINED TRANQUIL FROM FOURTEEN FOURTEEN TO FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO
AND BETTER TO GO AND SEEK HIM THAT FORTUNE IS ALWAYS MORE FAVORABLE TO ASSAILANTS THAN TO SUCH AS MERELY ACT ON THE DEFENSIVE AND THAT IT IS LESS INJURIOUS EVEN WHEN ATTENDED WITH GREATER IMMEDIATE EXPENSE
AND MORE SOLITARY THAN HERSELF
BY REDUCING THE COMPANIES FROM FOURTEEN TO SEVEN
ALL THAT RINALDO HAD ADVANCED WAS CORRECT AND THE REMEDIES HE PROPOSED GOOD AND CERTAIN IF THEY COULD BE ADOPTED WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTE DIVISION OF THE CITY AND THIS HE HAD NO DOUBT
GIORGIO ORDELAFFI WAS LORD OF FURLI
AND WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING A SORT OF SEWING MACHINE WHEN LIFE WAS BRIGHTENED FOR HER BY THE FINDING OF A FRIEND AMONG THE GIRLS WAS ONE QUIET SKILFUL CREATURE
EXPLAINING TO THEM HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS TO AGGRANDIZE ONE WHO POSSESSED SO MUCH INFLUENCE THAT IT WAS EASY TO REMEDY AN EVIL AT ITS COMMENCEMENT
SUNNYSIDE WITH ITS HOARD IN THE CHIMNEY ROOM HAD BEEN RENTED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE ATTEMPTS TO DISLODGE ME HAVING FAILED HE WAS DRIVEN TO BREAKING INTO HIS OWN HOUSE THE LADDER IN THE CHUTE THE BURNING OF THE STABLE AND THE ENTRANCE THROUGH THE CARD ROOM WINDOW
AND I BECAME MUCH INTERESTED IN WATCHING THEIR PROGRESS OFTEN RIDING DOWN TO SEE HOW THEY WERE GETTING ON THE HUMMER DID NOT RETURN MY INTEREST SHE WAS NERVOUS DARTING OFF WHEN BILLY SHOOK HIMSELF OR WHEN THE SHADOW OF A SOARING TURKEY BUZZARD FELL OVER THE NEST
I RETIRED TO MY UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM AND GOT OUT ELIZA KLINEFELTER'S LAVENDER SLIPPERS AH WELL THE FOSTER MOTHERHOOD WOULD SOON HAVE TO BE PUT AWAY IN CAMPHOR AGAIN THE NEXT DAY BY DEGREES I GOT THE WHOLE STORY
WERE LITHE AND SLENDER SOME OF THEM COULD BE SPANNED BY THE HANDS THE ROWS WERE PLANTED TEN FEET APART BUT THE LONG BRANCHES INTERLACED SO ONE HAD TO BE ON THE ALERT IN RIDING DOWN THE LINES TO BEND LOW ON THE SADDLE OR PUSH ASIDE THE BRANCHES THAT OBSTRUCTED THE WAY
AND ONE MITE OF A GRAY BACK WITH MICROSCOPIC YELLOW HAIRS ON EACH SIDE OF THE SPINE THE WHOLE TINY BODY SEEMED TO THROB WITH ITS HEART BEATS I WONDERED HOW SUCH A MIDGET COULD EVER BE FED BUT FOUND AS IN THE CASE OF THE HUMMER UNDER THE LITTLE LOVER'S TREE
THE NIGHT LIDDY AND I HEARD THE NOISE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT TOO WAS RIGHT ON THE NIGHT BEFORE ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS MURDERED JACK BAILEY HAD MADE HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO SEARCH FOR THE SECRET ROOM
OR BRONCHO PNEUMONIA DEATH MAY RESULT FROM INFLAMMATION OF THE LARYNX AND LUNGS WHEN SWALLOWED IN SOLUTION THE SYMPTOMS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF SODA AND POTASH POST MORTEM APPEARANCES SIMILAR TO OTHER CORROSIVES
BUT BEFORE THAT IN THE TIME OF ANDERSON THE OLD CASHIER WHO HAD DIED MUCH STRANGE JUGGLING HAD BEEN DONE WITH THE RECORDS THE RAILROAD IN NEW MEXICO HAD APPARENTLY DRAINED THE BANKER'S PRIVATE FORTUNE AND HE DETERMINED TO RETRIEVE IT BY ONE STROKE
THE NOTE LIDDY HAD FOUND IN GERTRUDE'S SCRAP BASKET WAS FROM HIM AND IT WAS HE WHO HAD STARTLED ME INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY THE CLOTHES CHUTE AND WITH GERTRUDE'S HELP HAD CARRIED ME TO LOUISE'S ROOM GERTRUDE I LEARNED HAD WATCHED ALL NIGHT BESIDE ME
DULL GREEN AND ALMOST ODORLESS THE SAME CHANGES ARE SEEN IN THE BARK FIRST THE TRUNKS ARE SMOOTH AND GREEN THEN THEY ARE HUNG WITH SHAGGY SHREDS OF BARK THIS IN TURN DROPS OFF SO THAT THE OLD TREES ARE SMOOTH AGAIN
WHAT SHE ONLY SUSPECTED WHAT SHE REALLY KNEW WE NEVER LEARNED SHE WAS A CHAMBERMAID IN THE HOTEL AT C AND IT WAS EVIDENTLY HER INTENTION TO BLACKMAIL DOCTOR WALKER HIS POSITION AT THAT TIME WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO ONE BAILEY HAD SENT AND IT SAID THAT PAUL ARMSTRONG WAS VERY ILL BAILEY WAS ALMOST DESPERATE HE DECIDED TO GO WEST AND FIND PAUL ARMSTRONG AND TO FORCE HIM TO DISGORGE
POTASH SODA AND AMMONIA CAUSTIC POTASH OCCURS IN CYLINDRICAL STICKS IS SOAPY TO THE TOUCH HAS AN ACRID TASTE
IN ONE OF THE TREES WE CAME TO AN ENORMOUS NEST MADE OF THE UNUSUAL MATERIALS THAT ARE SOMETIMES CHOSEN BY THAT STRANGE BIRD THE ROAD RUNNER IT WAS AN EXCITING DISCOVERY FOR THAT WAS BEFORE THE ROAD RUNNER HAD COME TO THE RANCH HOUSE
BUT MY DOLL WAS NOT STUFFED WITH SAWDUST FOR ALL OF THAT THERE WAS STILL MUCH TO ENJOY FOR A MOURNING DOVE FLEW FROM HER NEST OF TWIGS ALMOST OVER BILLY'S HEAD AND IT MADE ME QUITE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT THE GENTLE BIRD WAS BROODING HER EGGS IN MY WOODS
IN SAFETY MATCHES THE AMORPHOUS PHOSPHORUS IS ON THE BOX SYMPTOMS AT FIRST THOSE OF AN IRRITANT POISON BUT DAYS MAY ELAPSE BEFORE ANY CHARACTERISTIC SYMPTOMS APPEAR
MOREOVER HE SUSPECTED WHAT LOUISE DID NOT THAT THE MONEY WAS HIDDEN AT SUNNYSIDE HE HAD A SCRAP OF PAPER THAT INDICATED A CONCEALED ROOM SOMEWHERE HIS INHERITED CUPIDITY WAS AROUSED EAGER TO GET HALSEY AND JACK BAILEY OUT OF THE HOUSE
HE DENIED THE WHOLE THING AND SHE WENT TO HALSEY IT WAS THIS THAT HAD TAKEN HALSEY TO THE DOCTOR THE NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED HE ACCUSED THE DOCTOR OF THE DECEPTION AND CROSSING THE LAWN HAD SAID SOMETHING CRUEL TO LOUISE THEN FURIOUS AT HER APPARENT CONNIVANCE
AND SHAKE THE IODINE MAY BE OBTAINED ON EVAPORATION AS A SUBLIMATE
LIKE MAGNESIUM SULPHATE SOLUBLE IN WATER AND BITTER IN TASTE CARBONATE OF BARIUM IS FOUND IN SHOPS AS A FINE POWDER TASTELESS AND COLOURLESS INSOLUBLE IN WATER BUT EFFERVESCING WITH DILUTE ACIDS
THE BROWN EARTH BETWEEN THE ROWS WAS BARRED BY ALTERNATE LINES OF SUNLIGHT AND SHADOW AND THE VISTA OF EACH AVENUE ENDED IN BLUE SKY SOMETIMES COOL OCEAN BREEZES WOULD PENETRATE THE FOREST THE ROWS OF TREES WITH THEIR GENTLY SWAYING INTERLACING BRANCHES
SURFACE COLD PULSE WEAK THESE PREPARATIONS ARE NOT VOLATILE SO THAT THERE IS NOT MUCH FEAR OF LUNG TROUBLE IN CHRONIC CASES DEATH OCCURS FROM STRICTURE OF THE OESOPHAGUS CAUSING STARVATION POST MORTEM APPEARANCES
JOHN BAILEY HAD KNOWN PAUL ARMSTRONG INTIMATELY HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MONEY WAS GONE IN FACT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE IN THE INTERVAL SINCE THE SECURITIES HAD BEEN TAKEN WHERE WAS IT
AND CLOSING BEHIND ME THE DOORS OF MY REST HOUSE FOR THE LITTLE WOOD HAD COME TO SEEM LIKE A COOL WAYSIDE CHAPEL A PLACE OF PEACE
AT HALF AFTER NINE GROWING WEARY OF MY OWN COMPANY I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO FIND THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE DOOR OF THE LIVING ROOM I PAUSED GERTRUDE AND JACK HAD RETURNED AND WERE THERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A DIVAN WITH ONLY ONE LAMP LIGHTED THEY DID NOT SEE OR HEAR ME
THE EUCALYPTUS TREES CHANGE VERY CURIOUSLY AS THEY GROW OLD WHEN YOUNG THEY ARE COVERED WITH BRANCHES LOW TO THE GROUND AND THEIR AROMATIC TENDER LEAVES ARE LIGHT BLUISH GREEN AFTERWARDS THEY LOSE THEIR LOWER BRANCHES WHILE THEIR LEAVES BECOME STIFF AND SICKLE SHAPED
MAKING IT THE HIGHEST HUMMINGBIRD'S NEST I HAD EVER SEEN IT WAS ATTACHED TO A RED LEAF TO MARK THE SPOT PERHAPS ONE OFTEN WONDERS HOW A BIRD CAN COME BACK TWICE TO THE SAME LEAF IN A FOREST HOW ONE LITTLE HOME DOES MAKE A PLACE HABITABLE
WITH TWO MITES OF HUMMINGBIRDS SEATED ON A BRANCH THEIR GRAYISH GREEN SUITS TONED IN WITH THE COLOR OF THE BLUE GUMS IT WAS A SURPRISE WHEN ONE OF THEM TURNED TO THE OTHER AND FED IT THE MOTHER HUMMER WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO BE TAKEN FOR A NESTLING
EPIGASTRIC PAIN AND THEN SYMPTOMS OF IRRITANT POISONS GENERALLY CHRONIC POISONING IODISM IS CHARACTERIZED
I'VE BEEN FED ON IT MAN AND BOY FOR FIVE AND FORTY YEARS BRYCE MADE SOME FITTING REMARK AND WENT OUT AND HOME TO HIS ROOMS THERE TO SPEND MOST OF THE ENSUING EVENING IN TRYING TO PUZZLE OUT THE VARIOUS MYSTERIES OF THE DAY
BRYCE TURNED TO THE INDEX AT THE END OF HIS BOOK AN INDEX WRITTEN OUT IN VARIOUS STYLES OF HANDWRITING AND WITHIN A MINUTE HE FOUND THE NAME HE WANTED THERE IT WAS PLAINLY BEFORE HIM
ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF POLICE T X MEREDITH DID NOT OCCUPY OFFICES IN NEW SCOTLAND YARD IT IS THE PECULIARITY OF PUBLIC OFFICES THAT THEY ARE PLANNED WITH THE IDEA OF SUPPLYING THE MARGIN OF SPACE ABOVE ALL REQUIREMENTS
HE NODDED CURTLY TO MANSUS
SOUTHEAST CORNER OF PARADISE SAID CAMPANY SEVERAL TOMBS I COULD HAVE SPARED YOU THE TROUBLE OF LOOKING YOU'RE A REGULAR ENCYCLOPAEDIA ABOUT THE PLACE LAUGHED BRYCE I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW EVERY SPOUT AND GARGOYLE OUGHT TO ANSWERED THE LIBRARIAN
IF BY CHANCE YOU LOST THE KEYS OF YOUR SAFE
BEYOND THE TABLE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HE SAW AT ONCE THAT RANSFORD HOWEVER STRENUOUSLY HE MIGHT BE FIGHTING TO KEEP HIS FACE UNDER CONTROL
HE TURNED FROM T X TO THE DISCOMFORTED INSPECTOR VERY LITTLE SAID T X I'VE HAD MANSUS ON THE JOB
OF NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE THAT I KNOW OF BUT DOUBTLESS WITH A STORY OF ITS OWN WHY SHOULD ANY ONE BUT A BARTHORPE MAN PAST OR PRESENT BE INTERESTED IN THAT STORY SO FAR AS TO CARRY AN OLD ACCOUNT OF IT WITH HIM
HE IS VERY RICH HAS NO RELATIONS AND HAS A PASSION FOR POWER THEN HE'LL BE HUNG SAID THE CHIEF RISING I DOUBT IT SAID THE OTHER PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF MONEY SELDOM GET HUNG YOU ONLY GET HUNG FOR WANTING MONEY
THE ROOM IN WHICH HE LIVES IS PRACTICALLY A SAFE SIR GEORGE RAISED HIS EYEBROWS A SAFE HE REPEATED
THERE IS ONE DOOR WHICH IN ADDITION TO ITS ORDINARY LOCK IS CLOSED BY A SORT OF STEEL LATCH WHICH HE LETS FALL WHEN HE RETIRES FOR THE NIGHT AND WHICH HE OPENS HIMSELF PERSONALLY IN THE MORNING
HE HAS FOUND ALL THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND SAID T X WE DO NOT PERFORM MIRACLES IN THIS DEPARTMENT SIR GEORGE NOR CAN WE PICK UP THE THREADS OF A CASE AT FIVE MINUTES NOTICE
MYSTERIOUS UNDER SECRETARIES OF STATE WHO DISCUSS THINGS IN WHISPERS IN THE REMOTE CORNERS OF THEIR CLUBROOMS AND THE MORE FRANK VIEWS OF AMERICAN CORRESPONDENTS WHO HAD NO HESITATION IN PUTTING THOSE VIEWS INTO PRINT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR READERS
AND WITH THAT THE MIDDLE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS ENDED AND THE LAST ONE CAME WATCHED BY BRYCE WITH INCREASING ANXIETY FOR IT WAS SOON EVIDENT FROM CERTAIN REMARKS MADE BY THE CORONER
WE ARE UNEXPECTEDLY ABLE TO GET SOME EVIDENCE OF IDENTITY GENTLEMEN HE OBSERVED THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS JUST STEPPED INTO THE WITNESS BOX IS MISTER ALEXANDER CHILSTONE MANAGER OF THE LONDON AND COLONIES BANK IN THREADNEEDLE STREET
BURNT THE LOCKS FROM HIS SAFE AND SECURED THE NECESSARY INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE
SHARED IN PRESENTLY BY SOME OF THE OFFICIALS AT THE TABLE AND WHEN THE JURY CAME BACK THE STRANGER WAS AT ONCE USHERED INTO THE WITNESS BOX AND THE CORONER TURNED TO THE JURY AND THE COURT
ANNOUNCED A VERDICT OF DEATH BY MISADVENTURE
THE ADVERTISEMENT IS AS FOLLOWS HE ANNOUNCED IF THIS MEETS THE EYE OF OLD FRIEND MARCO HE WILL LEARN THAT STICKER WISHES TO SEE HIM AGAIN WRITE J BRADEN
WHO FOR ANYTHING THAT MISSUS PARTINGLEY OR ANYBODY ELSE COULD SAY TO THE CONTRARY MIGHT HAVE HAD AN APPOINTMENT AND BUSINESS WITH HIM BUT HIS GRACE KNEW NOTHING
HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE MIGHT TELL IF HE TOLD ALL THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE MIGHT GET OUT OF RANSFORD IF HE BRYCE WERE CORONER OR SOLICITOR AND HAD RANSFORD IN THAT WITNESS BOX HE WOULD ASK HIM ON HIS OATH IF HE KNEW THAT DEAD MAN
AND WHO BROUGHT TO BOOK SIR JULIUS WAGLITE THOUGH HE HAD COVERED HIS TRAIL OF DEFALCATION THROUGH THE BALANCE SHEETS OF THIRTY FOUR COMPANIES
A TELEPHONE BELL IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM RANG SHARPLY AND T X PICKED UP THE RECEIVER HE LISTENED INTENTLY
THE CHIEF OF THE POLICE IN THESE DAYS WAS A GREY MAN RATHER TIRED WITH A HAWK NOSE AND DEEP EYES THAT GLARED UNDER SHAGGY EYEBROWS
BUT T X PROTESTED THE INSPECTOR THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE FOUND IT WAS THE OUTRAGEOUS PRACTICE OF MISTER MEREDITH TO INSIST UPON HIS ASSOCIATES CALLING HIM BY HIS INITIALS A PRACTICE WHICH HAD EARNT DISAPPROVAL IN THE HIGHEST QUARTERS
AND THAT ON THEIR COMPLETION THEY ARE FOUND WHOLLY INADEQUATE TO HOUSE THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS WHICH MYSTERIOUSLY COME INTO PROGRESS COINCIDENT WITH THE BUILDING OPERATIONS
THAT THE UNFORTUNATE MAN HAD LOST HIS FOOTING ON IT AND BEFORE HE COULD RECOVER IT HAD BEEN SHOT OUT OF THE ARCH AND OVER THE BROKEN HEAD OF SAINT WRYTHA'S STAIR AND THOUGH AT A JURYMAN'S WISH VARNER WAS RECALLED AND STUCK STOUTLY TO HIS ORIGINAL STORY OF HAVING SEEN A HAND
AND TURNED TO THE WALL ON WHICH THE CHARTS AND MAPS WERE HUNG THERE WAS ONE THERE OF PARADISE WHEREON WAS MARKED THE SITE AND NAMES OF ALL THE TOMBS AND GRAVES IN THAT ANCIENT ENCLOSURE
AND AS HE SAT THERE LISTENING TO THE PRELIMINARIES AND TO THE EVIDENCE OF THE FIRST WITNESSES HIS ACTIVE AND SCHEMING MIND FIGURED TO ITSELF NOT WITHOUT MUCH CYNICAL AMUSEMENT
WHICH HE PROTESTED WAS CERTAINLY NOT THAT OF THE DEAD MAN IT SOON BECAME PLAIN THAT THE JURY SHARED THE CORONER'S BELIEF THAT VARNER IN HIS FRIGHT AND EXCITEMENT HAD BEEN MISTAKEN AND NO ONE WAS SURPRISED WHEN THE FOREMAN AFTER A VERY BRIEF CONSULTATION WITH HIS FELLOWS
WHO CONDUCTED TO THE CORONER A MIDDLE AGED WELL DRESSED MAN WHOM BRYCE AT ONCE SET DOWN AS A LONDON COMMERCIAL MAGNATE OF SOME QUALITY BETWEEN THE NEW ARRIVAL AND THE CORONER AN INTERCHANGE OF REMARKS WAS AT ONCE MADE
SIR GEORGE SMILED GRIMLY I HAVE THE INTEREST WHICH IS THE INTEREST OF MY DEPARTMENT HE SAID THAT IS TO SAY I WANT TO KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ABNORMAL PEOPLE WE HAVE HAD AN APPLICATION FROM HIM HE WENT ON WHICH IS RATHER UNUSUAL
BUT IT WAS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE SAID MISTER CHILSTONE THAT WAS ON THE DAY PREVIOUS TO HIS DEATH MISTER JOHN BRADEN HAD CALLED AT THE LONDON AND COLONIES BANK OF WHICH HE MISTER CHILSTONE WAS MANAGER
BOWING AND LOOKING ROUND UNEASILY AS IF AFRAID THE OLD PRINCE MIGHT APPEAR I AM SO GLAD YOU SHOULD GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER VERY SORRY THE PRINCE IS STILL AILING
PIERRE TOOK THE PACKET PRINCE ANDREW AS IF TRYING TO REMEMBER WHETHER HE HAD SOMETHING MORE TO SAY OR WAITING TO SEE IF PIERRE WOULD SAY ANYTHING LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIM
NATASHA WHAT IS IT ABOUT SHE ASKED WHAT DO THEY MATTER TO YOU IT WILL ALL PASS NATASHA
I SAY DO YOU REMEMBER OUR DISCUSSION IN PETERSBURG ASKED PIERRE ABOUT
WELL GOOD BY SO YOU'LL GIVE HER THE PACKET PIERRE LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT TO THE OLD PRINCE AND PRINCESS MARY THE OLD MAN SEEMED LIVELIER THAN USUAL
TO PIERRE THAT SMILE SAID PLAINLY I AM WELL
HE WAS SAYING BUT ON SEEING ROSTOV HE STOPPED SHORT AND FROWNED WHAT IS IT A PETITION WHAT IS IT ASKED THE PERSON IN THE OTHER ROOM ANOTHER PETITIONER ANSWERED THE MAN WITH THE BRACES
THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO MOVE HER TO THE COUNTRY AND SO THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN SENT FOR PIERRE SAW THE DISTRACTED COUNT AND SONYA WHO HAD A TEAR STAINED FACE BUT HE COULD NOT SEE NATASHA
KUTUZOV NOTICED PIERRE'S FIGURE AND THE GROUP GATHERED ROUND HIM CALL HIM TO ME SAID KUTUZOV
SAID TO PIERRE AS THOUGH CONTINUING AN INTERRUPTED CONVERSATION THE MILITIA HAVE PUT ON CLEAN WHITE SHIRTS TO BE READY TO DIE WHAT HEROISM COUNT
STILL GETTING STOUTER HE SAID WITH ANIMATION BUT THE NEW WRINKLE ON HIS FOREHEAD DEEPENED YES I AM WELL HE SAID IN ANSWER TO PIERRE'S QUESTION AND SMILED
HOW DID YOU GET HERE SAID A VOICE
HAYNE THE SAME GROOM WHO HAD BEEN AT AUSTERLITZ LED UP THE EMPEROR'S HORSE
I CANNOT BECAUSE THE LAW IS STRONGER THAN I AND HE RAISED HIS FOOT TO THE STIRRUP THE GENERAL BOWED HIS HEAD RESPECTFULLY
NO I WON'T MISS MY OPPORTUNITY NOW AS I DID AFTER AUSTERLITZ HE THOUGHT EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO MEET THE MONARCH AND CONSCIOUS OF THE BLOOD THAT RUSHED TO HIS HEART
NATASHA FELT OFFENDED BY THE HESITATION SHE HAD NOTICED IN THE ANTEROOM BY HER FATHER'S NERVOUSNESS
WAS OCCUPIED BY THE DIFFERENT EXPRESSION HE SAW ON OTHER FACES AN EXPRESSION THAT SPOKE NOT OF PERSONAL MATTERS BUT OF THE UNIVERSAL QUESTIONS OF LIFE AND DEATH
WHOM HAVE YOU COME FROM WHO ARE YOU I COME FROM MAJOR DENISOV ANSWERED ROSTOV
SHE WAS PREJUDICED AGAINST HER BY INVOLUNTARY ENVY OF HER BEAUTY YOUTH AND HAPPINESS AS WELL AS BY JEALOUSY OF HER BROTHER'S LOVE FOR HER
AFTER FIVE MINUTES OF IRKSOME CONSTRAINED CONVERSATION
A BED HAD BEEN MADE UP THERE AND SOME OPEN PORTMANTEAUS AND TRUNKS STOOD ABOUT PRINCE ANDREW WENT TO ONE AND TOOK OUT A SMALL CASKET FROM WHICH HE DREW A PACKET WRAPPED IN PAPER
THE GENTLEMEN OF THE EMPEROR'S SUITE
BELOW UNDER THE STAIRCASE WAS A DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER FLOOR WHOM DO YOU WANT SOMEONE INQUIRED
THOSE HE WROTE ABOUT GERAKOV LECTURES FOR THE CORPS INDITING
STEPPED UP TO PIERRE'S SIDE NEAR KUTUZOV AND IN A MOST NATURAL MANNER
THEY DROVE UP TO THE GLOOMY OLD HOUSE ON THE VOZDVIZHENKA AND ENTERED THE VESTIBULE WELL THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON US SAID THE COUNT
WITH GREAT IMPATIENCE SOME DAYS AFTER ANATOLE'S DEPARTURE PIERRE RECEIVED A NOTE FROM PRINCE ANDREW INFORMING HIM OF HIS ARRIVAL AND ASKING HIM TO COME TO SEE HIM
I BEG YOU TO EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME GOD IS MY WITNESS I DID NOT KNOW MUTTERED THE OLD MAN AND AFTER LOOKING NATASHA OVER FROM HEAD TO FOOT HE WENT OUT
SO UNNATURALLY AND SO UNPLEASANTLY THAT PRINCESS MARY STOOD WITH DOWNCAST EYES
THE MONARCH CAME OUT INTO THE PORCH PUTTING ON HIS GLOVES AND CARRYING HIS HAT UNDER HIS ARM
PRINCE ANDREW LAUGHED DISAGREEABLY AGAIN REMINDING ONE OF HIS FATHER AND WHERE IS YOUR BROTHER IN LAW NOW IF I MAY ASK HE SAID
IN ORDER TO STIFLE THOUGHTS THAT WERE TOO OPPRESSIVE AND TOO INTIMATE WHEN PRINCE MESHCHERSKI HAD LEFT PRINCE ANDREW TOOK PIERRE'S ARM AND ASKED HIM INTO THE ROOM THAT HAD BEEN ASSIGNED HIM
BY BENNIGSEN IN ANY CASE MANY GREAT REWARDS WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR TOMORROW'S ACTION AND NEW MEN WOULD COME TO THE FRONT
WHEN GOD ALONE KNOWS WHO OF US IS FATED TO SURVIVE
HAVING HEARD ROSTOV TO THE END THE GENERAL SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY I'M SORRY SORRY FOR THAT FINE FELLOW GIVE ME THE LETTER
THE FIRST PERSON WHO CAME TO MEET THE VISITORS WAS MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE SHE GREETED THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER WITH SPECIAL POLITENESS
WHAT IF NOTHING COULD MOVE THEM SUCH MOMENTS COME TO ALL MEN
HAD SET BEFORE HIM A GOAL OF POWER AND PRESTIGE TO BE ATTAINED WITHOUT THE MEDIUM OF ARTS GRACES TACT WEALTH BY SHEER WEIGHT OF MERIT ALONE ON THAT VIEW HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ENTITLED TO UNDISPUTED SUCCESS HIS FATHER
THE CHIEF INSPECTOR STOOPING GUARDEDLY OVER THE TABLE FOUGHT DOWN THE UNPLEASANT SENSATION IN HIS THROAT THE SHATTERING VIOLENCE OF DESTRUCTION WHICH HAD MADE OF THAT BODY A HEAP OF NAMELESS FRAGMENTS
AUTHORITIES FREE FROM ALL TAINT OF HATE AND DESPAIR AFTER PAYING THIS TRIBUTE TO WHAT IS NORMAL IN THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY
IN ORDER TO REACH SOONER THE POINT WHERE HE COULD TAKE HIS OMNIBUS HE TURNED BRUSQUELY OUT OF THE POPULOUS STREET INTO A NARROW AND DUSKY ALLEY PAVED WITH FLAGSTONES
HE WALKED WITH THE NERVELESS GAIT OF A TRAMP GOING ON STILL GOING ON INDIFFERENT TO RAIN OR SUN IN A SINISTER DETACHMENT FROM THE ASPECTS OF SKY AND EARTH CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ON THE OTHER HAND AFTER WATCHING HIM FOR A WHILE
THE MIND AND THE INSTINCTS OF A BURGLAR ARE OF THE SAME KIND AS THE MIND AND THE INSTINCTS OF A POLICE OFFICER BOTH RECOGNISE THE SAME CONVENTIONS AND HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER'S METHODS AND OF THE ROUTINE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TRADES
WHOSE MORALITY WAS ARTIFICIAL CORRUPT AND BLASPHEMOUS
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW YOURSELVES YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYTHING BY IT MEANTIME IT'S YOU WHO GET SOMETHING FROM IT SO FAR AND YOU GET IT EASILY TOO I WON'T SPEAK OF YOUR SALARY
IT WAS VERY WELL SAID WITHOUT SCORN WITH AN ALMOST AUSTERE QUIETNESS DOUBTLESS WAS THE ANSWER BUT THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT BELIEVE ME
A MAN SUPREMELY CONFIDENT IN THE PRIVILEGES OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE SON INDIVIDUALIST BY TEMPERAMENT ONCE THE SCIENCE OF COLLEGES HAD REPLACED THOROUGHLY THE FAITH OF CONVENTICLES
HE WAS IN A LONG STRAIGHT STREET PEOPLED BY A MERE FRACTION OF AN IMMENSE MULTITUDE
ON ONE SIDE THE LOW BRICK HOUSES HAD IN THEIR DUSTY WINDOWS THE SIGHTLESS MORIBUND LOOK OF INCURABLE DECAY EMPTY SHELLS AWAITING DEMOLITION FROM THE OTHER SIDE LIFE HAD NOT DEPARTED WHOLLY AS YET
LIKELY TO REMAIN FOR EVER UNKNOWN
EXCEPT BY SOME FORM OF COLLECTIVE OR INDIVIDUAL VIOLENCE WAS PRECISE AND CORRECT HE WAS A MORAL AGENT THAT WAS SETTLED IN HIS MIND BY EXERCISING HIS AGENCY WITH RUTHLESS DEFIANCE
WOULD HAVE SERVED HIS REPUTATION BETTER ON THE OTHER HAND HE ADMITTED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PRESERVE ONE'S REPUTATION IF RANK OUTSIDERS WERE GOING TO TAKE A HAND IN THE BUSINESS OUTSIDERS ARE THE BANE OF THE POLICE AS OF OTHER PROFESSIONS
ALL THE TIME HIS TRAINED FACULTIES OF AN EXCELLENT INVESTIGATOR WHO SCORNS NO CHANCE OF INFORMATION FOLLOWED THE SELF SATISFIED DISJOINTED LOQUACITY OF THE CONSTABLE
PUSHING ON BLIND AND ORDERLY AND ABSORBED IMPERVIOUS TO SENTIMENT TO LOGIC TO TERROR TOO PERHAPS THAT WAS THE FORM OF DOUBT HE FEARED MOST IMPERVIOUS TO FEAR OFTEN WHILE WALKING ABROAD
EVEN TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON HIDDEN BY THE ENORMOUS PILES OF BRICKS HE FELT THE MASS OF MANKIND MIGHTY IN ITS NUMBERS THEY SWARMED NUMEROUS LIKE LOCUSTS INDUSTRIOUS LIKE ANTS THOUGHTLESS LIKE A NATURAL FORCE
THE FACT OF THE OUTRAGE BEING ATTEMPTED LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER HE HAD ASSURED A HIGH OFFICIAL THAT NO OUTBREAK OF ANARCHIST ACTIVITY WAS TO BE APPREHENDED WAS SUFFICIENTLY ANNOYING IF HE EVER THOUGHT HIMSELF SAFE IN MAKING A STATEMENT IT WAS THEN
AFFECTED HIS FEELINGS WITH A SENSE OF RUTHLESS CRUELTY THOUGH HIS REASON TOLD HIM THE EFFECT MUST HAVE BEEN AS SWIFT AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING THE MAN WHOEVER HE WAS HAD DIED INSTANTANEOUSLY
WITHOUT PASSING THROUGH THE PANGS OF INCONCEIVABLE AGONY NO PHYSIOLOGIST AND STILL LESS OF A METAPHYSICIAN CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ROSE BY THE FORCE OF SYMPATHY WHICH IS A FORM OF FEAR ABOVE THE VULGAR CONCEPTION OF TIME
A DELICATE DARK ENTHUSIAST WITH A SLOPING FOREHEAD
LET HIM RUN ON THE HOSPITAL PORTER AND ANOTHER MAN TURNED DOWN THE CORNERS OF THE CLOTH AND STEPPED ASIDE THE CHIEF INSPECTOR'S EYES SEARCHED THE GRUESOME DETAIL OF THAT HEAP OF MIXED THINGS
OR ELSE THE HEROES WOULD HAVE TO BRUSH THEIR OWN CLOTHES LIKEWISE NO DEPARTMENT APPEARS PERFECTLY WISE TO THE INTIMACY OF ITS WORKERS A DEPARTMENT DOES NOT KNOW SO MUCH AS SOME OF ITS SERVANTS BEING A DISPASSIONATE ORGANISM
THE COLOUR OF RIPE CORN FRAMED WITH THEIR POINTS THE SQUARE BLOCK OF HIS SHAVED CHIN
HE HAD GONE EVEN SO FAR AS TO UTTER WORDS WHICH TRUE WISDOM WOULD HAVE KEPT BACK BUT CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS NOT VERY WISE AT LEAST NOT TRULY SO TRUE WISDOM
IT WAS VAIN TO PRETEND TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED BUT THAT WAS MERE FEELING THE STOICISM OF HIS THOUGHT COULD NOT BE DISTURBED BY THIS OR ANY OTHER FAILURE NEXT TIME
AND TOO MUCH EXACT INFORMATION AS WELL TO DISMISS THEM AS ROT THE DUSK OF THIS NARROW LANE TOOK ON A SINISTER TINT FROM THE DARK FRAIL LITTLE FIGURE ITS BACK TO THE WALL
HIS COURAGE AND HIS FAIRNESS HAD SECURED FOR HIM MUCH RESPECT AND SOME ADULATION IN THE SPHERE OF HIS EARLY SUCCESSES HE HAD FELT HIMSELF REVERED AND ADMIRED AND CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
THEN BY SUDDEN INSPIRATION RAISED THE COLLAR OF HIS JACKET THIS ARRANGEMENT APPEARED TO HIM COMMENDABLE
BEYOND THE GLOWING HEAPS OF ORANGES AND LEMONS NO FOOTSTEPS ECHOED THEY WOULD NEVER BE HEARD OF AGAIN THE ADVENTUROUS HEAD OF THE SPECIAL CRIMES DEPARTMENT WATCHED THESE DISAPPEARANCES FROM A DISTANCE WITH AN INTERESTED EYE HE FELT LIGHT HEARTED
OF EVIL FREEDOM IT WAS RATHER PLEASANT WHEN AFTER PAYING FOR HIS SHORT MEAL HE STOOD UP AND WAITED FOR HIS CHANGE HE SAW HIMSELF IN THE SHEET OF GLASS AND WAS STRUCK
I'LL WARN TOODLES TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU HE'LL TAKE YOU INTO MY ROOM THE NUMEROUS FAMILY AND THE WIDE CONNECTIONS OF THE YOUTHFUL LOOKING PRIVATE SECRETARY CHERISHED FOR HIM THE HOPE OF AN AUSTERE AND EXALTED DESTINY
UNLESS ONE WERE TO ACCEPT THE FANTASTIC THEORY THAT HE WAS A DEAF MUTE
HE THOUGHT I'LL GET A LITTLE WET A LITTLE SPLASHED HE BECAME AWARE OF THE WAITER AT HIS ELBOW AND OF A SMALL PILE OF SILVER COINS ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE BEFORE HIM THE WAITER KEPT ONE EYE ON IT
MOCKING AN ABJECT MANKIND IN THE MOST PRESSING OF ITS MISERABLE NECESSITIES IN THIS IMMORAL ATMOSPHERE THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER REFLECTING UPON HIS ENTERPRISE SEEMED TO LOSE SOME MORE OF HIS IDENTITY HE HAD A SENSE OF LONELINESS
THE GILT HANDS HAD TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL THROUGH NO LESS THAN FIVE AND TWENTY MINUTES BEHIND HIS BACK THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER WHO COULD NOT SEE THEM GREW A LITTLE NERVOUS IN THE INTERVAL BUT THE GREAT MAN PRESENTED TO HIM A CALM AND UNDISMAYED FACE
THE VERY PECULIARITIES WHICH SURPRISE AND PERPLEX CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ESTABLISH ITS CHARACTER IN MY EYES I AM KEEPING CLEAR OF DETAILS SIR ETHELRED
THE CRAWLING APPROACH OF A HANSOM HE GAVE NO SIGN BUT WHEN THE LOW STEP GLIDING ALONG THE CURBSTONE CAME TO HIS FEET HE DODGED IN SKILFULLY IN FRONT OF THE BIG TURNING WHEEL AND SPOKE UP THROUGH THE LITTLE TRAP DOOR
THEY'LL HAVE TO GET A HARD RAP ON THE KNUCKLES OVER THIS AFFAIR WE MUST BE IN A POSITION TO WHAT IS YOUR GENERAL IDEA STATED SHORTLY NO NEED TO GO INTO DETAILS NO SIR ETHELRED IN PRINCIPLE
IT WAS BY NO MEANS GROUNDLESS AND YET THIS EPISODE HAPPENS I CALL IT AN EPISODE BECAUSE THIS AFFAIR I MAKE BOLD TO SAY IS EPISODIC IT IS NO PART OF ANY GENERAL SCHEME HOWEVER WILD
YES BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN TO SAY FIRST THAT THERE'S BUT POOR COMFORT IN BEING ABLE TO DECLARE THAT ANY GIVEN ACT OF VIOLENCE DAMAGING PROPERTY OR DESTROYING LIFE IS NOT THE WORK OF ANARCHISM AT ALL
DISHES SET BEFORE THEM WITH EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF UNSTAMPED RESPECTABILITY NEITHER WAS THEIR PERSONALITY STAMPED IN ANY WAY PROFESSIONALLY SOCIALLY OR RACIALLY THEY SEEMED CREATED FOR THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT
IT WILL GET ON HIS NERVES PRESENTLY I SAY THESE FOREIGN SCOUNDRELS AREN'T LIKELY TO THROW SOMETHING AT HIM ARE THEY IT WOULD BE A NATIONAL CALAMITY THE COUNTRY CAN'T SPARE HIM NOT TO MENTION YOURSELF HE LEANS ON YOUR ARM SUGGESTED THE
THIRDLY THE EXISTENCE OF THESE SPIES AMONGST THE REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS WHICH WE ARE REPROACHED FOR HARBOURING HERE DOES AWAY WITH ALL CERTITUDE
IS HE SAFE IN THE STREETS MULLINS HAS BEEN MARCHING HIS MEN UP HERE THIS AFTERNOON
AND CAME UPON A LARGE VAN ARRESTED IN FRONT OF THE DIMLY LIT WINDOW PANES OF A CARTER'S EATING HOUSE THE MAN WAS REFRESHING HIMSELF INSIDE AND THE HORSES THEIR BIG HEADS LOWERED TO THE GROUND FED OUT OF NOSE BAGS STEADILY FARTHER ON
THAT'S ALWAYS A MISTAKE BESIDES I WANT A FREE HAND
THE PERSONAGE ON THE HEARTHRUG HAD GRADUALLY TILTED HIS HEAD FARTHER BACK WHICH GAVE HIM AN ASPECT OF EXTRAORDINARY HAUGHTINESS WHY NOT LEAVE IT TO HEAT BECAUSE HE IS AN OLD DEPARTMENTAL HAND
UNLESS THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT HAD BEEN PERCHANCE CREATED FOR THEM BUT THAT LAST HYPOTHESIS WAS UNTHINKABLE SINCE ONE COULD NOT PLACE THEM ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THOSE SPECIAL ESTABLISHMENTS
NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY ACCIDENT BUT AN EXTRAORDINARY LITTLE FACT REMAINS THE ADDRESS ON HIS CLOTHING DISCOVERED BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT TOO IT IS AN INCREDIBLE LITTLE FACT SO INCREDIBLE THAT THE EXPLANATION WHICH WILL ACCOUNT FOR IT IS BOUND TO TOUCH THE BOTTOM OF THIS AFFAIR
WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY IMPORTING THEIR METHODS OF CRIM TARTARY HERE A TURK WOULD HAVE MORE DECENCY YOU FORGET SIR ETHELRED THAT STRICTLY SPEAKING WE KNOW NOTHING POSITIVELY AS YET NO BUT HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE IT SHORTLY
A PLEASURABLE FEELING OF INDEPENDENCE POSSESSED HIM WHEN HE HEARD THE GLASS DOORS SWING TO BEHIND HIS BACK WITH A SORT OF IMPERFECT BAFFLED THUD HE ADVANCED AT ONCE INTO AN IMMENSITY OF GREASY SLIME
THE POLICEMAN ON THE BEAT PROJECTED HIS SOMBRE AND MOVING FORM AGAINST THE LUMINOUS GLORY OF ORANGES AND LEMONS AND ENTERED BRETT STREET WITHOUT HASTE THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER AS THOUGH HE WERE A MEMBER OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES
IT'S HIS NERVES THAT I AM AFRAID OF THE REACTIONARY GANG WITH THAT ABUSIVE BRUTE CHEESEMAN AT THEIR HEAD INSULT HIM EVERY NIGHT IF HE WILL INSIST ON BEGINNING A REVOLUTION MURMURED THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER THE TIME HAS COME
INTIMATED BY AN EARNEST DEFERENTIAL GESTURE THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO BE CONCISE
SIR ETHELRED OPENED A WIDE MOUTH LIKE A CAVERN INTO WHICH THE HOOKED NOSE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PEER THERE CAME FROM IT A SUBDUED ROLLING SOUND AS FROM A DISTANT ORGAN
HIS DESCENT INTO THE STREET WAS LIKE THE DESCENT INTO A SLIMY AQUARIUM FROM WHICH THE WATER HAD BEEN RUN OFF
I AM AFRAID THAT IF YOU WANT TO GO DOWN INTO HISTORY YOU'LL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING FOR IT SERIOUSLY THERE'S NO DANGER WHATEVER FOR BOTH OF YOU BUT FROM OVERWORK THE SYMPATHETIC TOODLES WELCOMED THIS OPENING FOR A CHUCKLE
WHO PASSED UP TO A DISTANT TABLE LOOKING PERFECTLY SIGHTLESS AND ALTOGETHER UNAPPROACHABLE SHE SEEMED TO BE A HABITUAL CUSTOMER ON GOING OUT
THE RINGING IMPACT OF TRUCKS THE SHARP WHISTLE OF THE ENGINES FROM THE JUNCTION MINGLED WITH THEIR SHOUTS OF MEN FROM MARS EXCITED MEN CAME INTO THE STATION ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK WITH INCREDIBLE TIDINGS
POOR OGILVY AFTER BREAKFAST INSTEAD OF WORKING I DECIDED TO WALK DOWN TOWARDS THE COMMON
AS THOUGH NO PLANET MARS EXISTED IN THE SKY EVEN AT WOKING STATION AND HORSELL AND CHOBHAM THAT WAS THE CASE IN WOKING JUNCTION UNTIL A LATE HOUR TRAINS WERE STOPPING AND GOING ON
ONE OF OUR CHIMNEYS CRACKED AS IF A SHOT HAD HIT IT FLEW AND A PIECE OF IT CAME CLATTERING DOWN THE TILES
LORD SAID THE LANDLORD WHAT'S THE HURRY I'M SELLING MY BIT OF A PIG
IF ON FRIDAY NIGHT YOU HAD TAKEN A PAIR OF COMPASSES
AND CAUSED NO MORE DISTURBANCE THAN DRUNKARDS MIGHT HAVE DONE PEOPLE RATTLING LONDONWARDS PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS AND SAW ONLY A RARE FLICKERING VANISHING SPARK DANCE UP FROM THE DIRECTION OF HORSELL
OTHERS WERE SHUNTING ON THE SIDINGS PASSENGERS WERE ALIGHTING AND WAITING AND EVERYTHING WAS PROCEEDING IN THE MOST ORDINARY WAY A BOY FROM THE TOWN TRENCHING ON SMITH'S MONOPOLY WAS SELLING PAPERS WITH THE AFTERNOON'S NEWS
FRESH ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO SIGNAL BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS WAS THE STEREOTYPED FORMULA OF THE PAPERS A SAPPER TOLD ME IT WAS DONE BY A MAN IN A DITCH WITH A FLAG ON A LONG POLE THE MARTIANS TOOK AS MUCH NOTICE OF SUCH ADVANCES
I DESCRIBED THE HEAT RAY TO THEM AND THEY BEGAN TO ARGUE AMONG THEMSELVES CRAWL UP UNDER COVER AND RUSH EM SAY I SAID ONE
THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES WERE CERTAINLY ALIVE TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE BUSINESS
BLOW YER TRENCHES YOU ALWAYS WANT TRENCHES
TALK ABOUT FISHERS OF MEN FIGHTERS OF FISH IT IS THIS TIME IT AIN'T NO MURDER KILLING BEASTS LIKE THAT SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER
THE FEVER OF WAR THAT WOULD PRESENTLY CLOG VEIN AND ARTERY DEADEN NERVE AND DESTROY BRAIN HAD STILL TO DEVELOP ALL NIGHT LONG THE MARTIANS WERE HAMMERING AND STIRRING SLEEPLESS INDEFATIGABLE
I RAN FOR I PERCEIVED THAT IN A MOMENT EVERYONE UPON THIS SIDE OF THE HILL WOULD BE MOVING I FOUND HIM IN HIS BAR QUITE UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND HIS HOUSE A MAN STOOD
SWEPT THE COMMON AND THE HEAT RAY WAS READY TO FOLLOW SAVE FOR SUCH THAT BIG AREA OF COMMON WAS SILENT AND DESOLATE AND THE CHARRED BODIES LAY ABOUT ON IT ALL NIGHT UNDER THE STARS AND ALL THE NEXT DAY A
THEY AREN'T TO BE KILLED SAID THE MILKMAN IF THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE AVOIDED
CAUSED A WHIRL OF EXCITEMENT A SHOUTING AND A RUNNING TO AND FRO BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE DAILY ROUTINE OF WORKING EATING DRINKING SLEEPING WENT ON AS IT HAD DONE FOR COUNTLESS YEARS
ALL OVER THE DISTRICT PEOPLE WERE DINING AND SUPPING WORKING MEN WERE GARDENING AFTER THE LABOURS OF THE DAY
AND HERE AND THERE A MESSENGER
I SHOUTED AFTER HIM WHAT NEWS HE TURNED STARED BAWLED SOMETHING ABOUT CRAWLING OUT IN A THING LIKE A DISH COVER
SOMETHING OF MY SCHOOLBOY DREAMS OF BATTLE AND HEROISM CAME BACK
YOU CARN TELL WHAT THEY MIGHT DO WHERE'S YOUR SHELLS SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER THERE AIN'T NO TIME
I DID NOT SUCCEED IN GETTING A GLIMPSE OF THE COMMON FOR EVEN HORSELL AND CHOBHAM CHURCH TOWERS WERE IN THE HANDS OF THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES THE SOLDIERS I ADDRESSED DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
HAD IMMEDIATELY TO TURN MY ATTENTION TO THE HORSE WHEN I LOOKED BACK AGAIN THE SECOND HILL HAD HIDDEN THE BLACK SMOKE I SLASHED THE HORSE WITH THE WHIP AND GAVE HIM A LOOSE REIN UNTIL WOKING AND SEND LAY BETWEEN US AND THAT QUIVERING TUMULT
THEIR IDEA WAS THAT A DISPUTE HAD ARISEN AT THE HORSE GUARDS THE ORDINARY SAPPER IS A GREAT DEAL BETTER EDUCATED THAN THE COMMON SOLDIER AND THEY DISCUSSED THE PECULIAR CONDITIONS OF THE POSSIBLE FIGHT WITH SOME ACUTENESS
DIRTY RED JACKETS UNBUTTONED
I HAD SLEPT BUT LITTLE THOUGH MY WIFE HAD SUCCEEDED IN SLEEPING AND I ROSE EARLY
THE BEECH TREES BELOW THE HOUSE WERE BURNING WHILE I DID THIS AND THE PALINGS UP THE ROAD GLOWED RED WHILE I WAS OCCUPIED IN THIS WAY ONE OF THE DISMOUNTED HUSSARS CAME RUNNING UP HE WAS GOING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WARNING PEOPLE TO LEAVE
BEEN BORN A RABBIT SNIPPY AIN'T THEY GOT ANY NECKS THEN SAID A THIRD ABRUPTLY A LITTLE CONTEMPLATIVE DARK MAN SMOKING A PIPE I REPEATED MY DESCRIPTION OCTOPUSES SAID HE THAT'S WHAT I CALLS EM
NOISE OF HAMMERING FROM THE PIT WAS HEARD BY MANY PEOPLE SO YOU HAVE THE STATE OF THINGS ON FRIDAY NIGHT IN THE CENTRE STICKING INTO THE SKIN OF OUR OLD PLANET EARTH LIKE A POISONED DART WAS THIS CYLINDER
I MUST HAVE A POUND SAID THE LANDLORD AND I'VE NO ONE TO DRIVE IT
IN ANOTHER MOMENT WE WERE CLEAR OF THE SMOKE AND NOISE AND SPANKING DOWN THE OPPOSITE SLOPE OF MAYBURY HILL TOWARDS OLD WOKING
A RED GLOW AND A THIN VEIL OF SMOKE DRIVING ACROSS THE STARS AND THOUGHT THAT NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN A HEATH FIRE WAS HAPPENING IT WAS ONLY ROUND THE EDGE OF THE COMMON THAT ANY DISTURBANCE WAS PERCEPTIBLE
AS WE SHOULD OF THE LOWING OF A COW I MUST CONFESS THE SIGHT OF ALL THIS ARMAMENT ALL THIS PREPARATION GREATLY EXCITED ME MY IMAGINATION BECAME BELLIGERENT AND DEFEATED THE INVADERS IN A DOZEN STRIKING WAYS
AND THE MAYBURY INN WITH ITS SWINGING SIGN I SAW THE DOCTOR'S CART AHEAD OF ME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL I TURNED MY HEAD TO LOOK AT THE HILLSIDE I WAS LEAVING THICK STREAMERS OF BLACK SMOKE
OR TO DEVELOP EM OR SOMETHING
THIS ADVANCE UPON NATURE WAS TOO CALM HE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT HE HAD TIME IN WHICH TO WONDER ABOUT HIMSELF AND TO ATTEMPT TO PROBE HIS SENSATIONS ABSURD IDEAS TOOK HOLD UPON HIM
TO THE LIGHT AND SPEEDY INFANTRY OF PRACTICE THE REGIMENT RELIEVED OF A BURDEN RECEIVED A NEW IMPETUS BUT THERE WAS MUCH LOSS OF VALUABLE KNAPSACKS AND ON THE WHOLE VERY GOOD SHIRTS
SMOKE CLOUDS WENT SLOWLY AND INSOLENTLY ACROSS THE FIELDS LIKE OBSERVANT PHANTOMS THE DIN BECAME CRESCENDO LIKE THE ROAR OF AN ONCOMING TRAIN
A HOUSE STANDING PLACIDLY IN DISTANT FIELDS HAD TO HIM AN OMINOUS LOOK THE SHADOWS OF THE WOODS WERE FORMIDABLE HE WAS CERTAIN THAT IN THIS VISTA THERE LURKED FIERCE EYED HOSTS
AFTER A TIME THE BRIGADE WAS HALTED IN THE CATHEDRAL LIGHT OF A FOREST THE BUSY SKIRMISHERS WERE STILL POPPING THROUGH THE AISLES OF THE WOOD COULD BE SEEN THE FLOATING SMOKE FROM THEIR RIFLES
THE GENERALS WERE IDIOTS TO SEND THEM MARCHING INTO A REGULAR PEN THERE WAS BUT ONE PAIR OF EYES IN THE CORPS HE WOULD STEP FORTH AND MAKE A SPEECH
THEY WERE ALL GOING TO BE SACRIFICED THE GENERALS WERE STUPIDS THE ENEMY WOULD PRESENTLY SWALLOW THE WHOLE COMMAND HE GLARED ABOUT HIM EXPECTING TO SEE THE STEALTHY APPROACH OF HIS DEATH
ONCE WHEN THE COMMAND HAD FIRST COME TO THE FIELD SOME PERAMBULATING VETERANS NOTING THE LENGTH OF THEIR COLUMN HAD ACCOSTED THEM THUS
SPREAD OVER THE GRASS AND IN AMONG THE TREE TRUNKS HE COULD SEE KNOTS AND WAVING LINES OF SKIRMISHERS WHO WERE RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER AND FIRING AT THE LANDSCAPE A DARK BATTLE LINE LAY UPON A SUNSTRUCK CLEARING THAT GLEAMED ORANGE COLOR
NO SECH THING HANNISES BATT'RY WAS LONG HERE BOUT A MINUTE AGO THAT YOUNG HASBROUCK HE MAKES A GOOD OFF'CER
BUT THE OTHER GAVE HIM A GLANCE AS FROM THE DEPTHS OF A TOMB
MEN EXTRICATED THEMSELVES FROM THICK SHIRTS PRESENTLY FEW CARRIED ANYTHING BUT THEIR NECESSARY CLOTHING BLANKETS HAVERSACKS CANTEENS AND ARMS AND AMMUNITION YOU CAN NOW EAT AND SHOOT
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THE DAMP FOG OF EARLY MORNING MOVED FROM THE RUSH OF A GREAT BODY OF TROOPS FROM THE DISTANCE CAME A SUDDEN SPATTER OF FIRING HE WAS BEWILDERED AS HE RAN WITH HIS COMRADES HE STRENUOUSLY TRIED TO THINK
HE WAS IN A MOVING BOX AS HE PERCEIVED THIS FACT IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE HAD NEVER WISHED TO COME TO THE WAR HE HAD NOT ENLISTED OF HIS FREE WILL HE HAD BEEN DRAGGED BY THE MERCILESS GOVERNMENT
THE BATTLE REFLECTION THAT SHONE FOR AN INSTANT IN THE FACES ON THE MAD CURRENT MADE THE YOUTH FEEL THAT FORCEFUL HANDS FROM HEAVEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE HELD HIM IN PLACE IF HE COULD HAVE GOT INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF HIS LEGS
FROM THEIR FEET TO THEIR FOREHEADS A MARK THEY SAID THEY SCORNED THE DEVICES OF THE CAUTIOUS BUT THE OTHERS SCOFFED IN REPLY AND POINTED TO THE VETERANS ON THE FLANKS WHO WERE DIGGING AT THE GROUND LIKE TERRIERS
HE COULD NOT RAGE IN FIERCE ARGUMENT IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH SANDWICHES DURING HIS MEALS HE ALWAYS WORE AN AIR OF BLISSFUL CONTEMPLATION OF THE FOOD HE HAD SWALLOWED
BUT THE REGIMENT WAS NOT YET VETERANLIKE IN APPEARANCE
THE YOUTH FORGETTING HIS NEAT PLAN OF GETTING KILLED GAZED SPELL BOUND HIS EYES GREW WIDE AND BUSY WITH THE ACTION OF THE SCENE HIS MOUTH WAS A LITTLE WAYS OPEN
HE THOUGHT THAT HE MUST BREAK FROM THE RANKS AND HARANGUE HIS COMRADES THEY MUST NOT ALL BE KILLED LIKE PIGS AND HE WAS SURE IT WOULD COME TO PASS UNLESS THEY WERE INFORMED OF THESE DANGERS
PRESENTLY THE ARMY AGAIN SAT DOWN TO THINK THE ODOR OF THE PEACEFUL PINES WAS IN THE MEN'S NOSTRILS
THEY ATE THEIR NOON MEAL BEHIND A THIRD ONE THEY WERE MOVED FROM THIS ONE ALSO THEY WERE MARCHED FROM PLACE TO PLACE WITH APPARENT AIMLESSNESS
IT LOOKED TO BE A WRONG PLACE FOR A BATTLE FIELD THE SKIRMISHERS IN ADVANCE FASCINATED HIM
DIRECTLY THE YOUTH COULD SEE THE SKIRMISHERS RUNNING THEY WERE PURSUED BY THE SOUND OF MUSKETRY FIRE AFTER A TIME THE HOT DANGEROUS FLASHES OF THE RIFLES WERE VISIBLE
YEH RUN LIKE A COW AND THE LOUD SOLDIER'S SHRILL VOICE COULD BE HEARD
OF A SUDDEN HE FELT A HEAVY AND SAD HAND LAID UPON HIS SHOULDER AWAKENING FROM HIS TRANCE OF OBSERVATION HE TURNED AND BEHELD THE LOUD SOLDIER
THE MEN HAD BEGUN TO COUNT THE MILES UPON THEIR FINGERS AND THEY GREW TIRED SORE FEET AN DAMNED SHORT RATIONS THAT'S ALL SAID THE LOUD SOLDIER
THE LINE BROKEN INTO MOVING FRAGMENTS BY THE GROUND WENT CALMLY ON THROUGH FIELDS AND WOODS THE YOUTH LOOKED AT THE MEN NEAREST HIM AND SAW FOR THE MOST PART EXPRESSIONS OF DEEP INTEREST
IN DEATH IT EXPOSED TO HIS ENEMIES THAT POVERTY WHICH IN LIFE HE HAD PERHAPS CONCEALED FROM HIS FRIENDS THE RANKS OPENED COVERTLY TO AVOID THE CORPSE THE INVULNERABLE DEAD MAN FORCED A WAY FOR HIMSELF
SAID THE LATTER WITH INTENSE GLOOM HE WAS QUITE PALE AND HIS GIRLISH LIP WAS TREMBLING
NOT MORE'N FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO WELL
BULLETS BEGAN TO WHISTLE AMONG THE BRANCHES AND NIP AT THE TREES TWIGS AND LEAVES CAME SAILING DOWN
WELL THEN WHAT DID THEY MARCH US OUT HERE FOR HE DEMANDED OF THE TALL SOLDIER THE LATTER WITH CALM FAITH BEGAN A HEAVY EXPLANATION
THE SWIFT THOUGHT CAME TO HIM THAT THE GENERALS DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT IT WAS ALL A TRAP SUDDENLY THOSE CLOSE FORESTS WOULD BRISTLE WITH RIFLE BARRELS IRONLIKE BRIGADES WOULD APPEAR IN THE REAR
WELL CRIED THE YOUTH STILL FIDGETING
THEREUPON HE APPLAUDED THE WISDOM OF HIS TEACHER FOR IF HE HAD BATHED AT THE COMMON BATHING PLACE SOMEONE WOULD HAVE SEEN THE PURSE AND HAVE TAKEN IT AWAY WHEN EVENING CAME ON HE TURNED INTO A VILLAGE AND ASKED THE HEADMAN
YES IT HURTS HURTS A GOOD DEAL HE REPLIED THERE WAS A FALTERING IN HIS VOICE OH SAID THE CORPORAL HE LINKED HIS ARM IN THE YOUTH'S AND DREW HIM FORWARD COME ON HENRY
SPRAWLING IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE POSTURE GLANCING NARROWLY INTO THE MORE DISTANT DARKNESS HE CAUGHT OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF VISAGES THAT LOOMED PALLID AND GHOSTLY LIT WITH A PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW
I'VE GOT YOUR THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER SNARLED
HE GAVE A LONG SIGH SNUGGLED DOWN INTO HIS BLANKET AND IN A MOMENT
OF A SUDDEN HE CONFRONTED A BLACK AND MONSTROUS FIGURE A RIFLE BARREL CAUGHT SOME GLINTING BEAMS HALT HALT HE WAS DISMAYED FOR A MOMENT BUT HE PRESENTLY THOUGHT THAT HE
HOL ON A MINNIT WHERE YOU GOIN T SLEEP HIS FRIEND WAVED HIS HAND IMPATIENTLY
THAT EVENING HE REACHED THE BOUNDARY OF HIS OWN TERRITORY AND DECIDED TO PRESS ON HOME ALTHOUGH IT WAS DARK AT MIDNIGHT HE REACHED THE PALACE AND WITHOUT AROUSING ANYONE WENT TO THE DOOR OF HIS WIFE'S ROOM
OCCASIONALLY IN THIS LOW ARCHED HALL A SOLDIER WOULD AROUSE AND TURN HIS BODY TO A NEW POSITION THE EXPERIENCE OF HIS SLEEP HAVING TAUGHT HIM OF UNEVEN AND OBJECTIONABLE PLACES UPON THE GROUND UNDER HIM
RECOGNIZED THE NERVOUS VOICE AS HE STOOD TOTTERING BEFORE THE RIFLE BARREL HE CALLED OUT
AND HE RESOLVED TO GO AWAY TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO ACQUIRE WISDOM
THE PRINCE WHO ACQUIRED WISDOM THERE WAS ONCE A RAJA WHO HAD AN ONLY SON AND THE RAJA WAS ALWAYS URGING HIS SON TO LEARN TO READ AND WRITE IN ORDER THAT WHEN HE CAME TO HIS KINGDOM
AND HE BEGAN TO REPENT OF HAVING SPENT HIS GOLD PIECES ON ADVICE THAT SEEMED WORTHLESS HOWEVER ON HIS WAY HE TURNED INTO A BAZAR TO BUY SOME FOOD
HE COULD SEE THE FORMS OF MEN THROWING BLACK SHADOWS IN THE RED LIGHT AND AS HE WENT NEARER IT BECAME KNOWN TO HIM IN SOME WAY THAT THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH SLEEPING MEN
THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER WATCHED HIS COMRADE WITH AN AIR OF SATISFACTION HE LATER PRODUCED AN EXTENSIVE HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET
POOR OL BOY WE MUST HOL ON A MINNIT WHAT AM I DOIN I'LL CALL SIMPSON ANOTHER FIGURE AT THAT MOMENT LOOMED IN THE GLOOM
AND THE RARE WOUND AH HERE WE ARE HE SAID HE AWKWARDLY MADE FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS JEST AS I THOUGHT HE ADDED PRESENTLY YEH'VE BEEN GRAZED BY A BALL
HIS LOWER JAW HUNG DOWN AS IF LACKING STRENGTH TO ASSUME ITS NORMAL POSITION HE WAS THE PICTURE OF AN EXHAUSTED SOLDIER AFTER A FEAST OF WAR HE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE TO SLEEP WITH HIS SWORD IN HIS ARMS
AN HE'S IN A FIX AN WE MUST SEE T HIM RIGHT AWAY HE RESTED HIS RIFLE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS LEFT ARM AND HIS RIGHT AROUND THE YOUTH'S SHOULDER GEE IT MUST HURT LIKE THUNDER HE SAID THE YOUTH LEANED HEAVILY UPON HIS FRIEND
BADGERED BY DREAMS PERHAPS HE SWAYED WITH LITTLE BOUNCES AND STARTS LIKE AN OLD TODDY STRICKEN GRANDFATHER IN A CHIMNEY CORNER DUST AND STAINS WERE UPON HIS FACE
THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER CAME SWINGING TWO CANTEENS BY THEIR LIGHT STRINGS WELL NOW HENRY OL BOY SAID THE LATTER WE'LL HAVE YEH FIXED UP IN JEST ABOUT A MINNIT HE HAD THE BUSTLING WAYS OF AN AMATEUR NURSE
TO LET HIM SLEEP IN HIS VERANDAH AND THERE WAS ALREADY ONE OTHER TRAVELLER SLEEPING THERE AND IN THE MORNING IT WAS FOUND THAT THE TRAVELLER HAD DIED IN HIS SLEEP THEN THE HEADMAN CONSULTED THE VILLAGERS AND THEY DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE
WHO YEH TALKIN TO WILSON HE DEMANDED HIS VOICE WAS ANGER TONED WHO YEH TALKIN TO
WITHIN THE GLEAM OF ROSE AND ORANGE LIGHT FROM THE BURNING STICKS WERE OTHER SOLDIERS SNORING AND HEAVING OR LYING DEATHLIKE IN SLUMBER A FEW PAIRS OF LEGS WERE STUCK FORTH RIGID AND STRAIGHT
AND ASKED HIM WHETHER THERE WERE ANY WISE MEN LIVING IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH WISE MEN ASKED THE PLOUGHMAN THE PRINCE SAID THAT HE WAS TRAVELLING TO GET WISDOM THE PLOUGHMAN SAID THAT HE WOULD GIVE HIM INSTRUCTION IF HE WERE PAID
HE SUBMITTED PASSIVELY TO THE LATTER'S DIRECTING STRENGTH HIS HEAD WAS IN THE OLD MANNER HANGING FORWARD UPON HIS BREAST HIS KNEES WOBBLED
I GOT SHOT TOO HIS FRIEND HAD STEPPED FORWARD QUICKLY WHAT
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO DO SO WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE MAXIM OF HIS INSTRUCTOR AND PULLED THE RUG TO ONE SIDE AND WHEN HE DID SO HE SAW THAT IT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER THE MOUTH OF A WELL AND THAT IF HE HAD SAT ON IT
WHENEVER YOU GO TO BATHE DO NOT BATHE AT THE COMMON BATHING PLACE BUT AT A PLACE BY YOURSELF GIVE ME MY COIN AND THE PRINCE DID SO THEN HE CONTINUED
THE RIFLE WAS LOWERED TO A POSITION OF CAUTION AND THE LOUD SOLDIER CAME SLOWLY FORWARD HE PEERED INTO THE YOUTH'S FACE THAT YOU HENRY YES IT'S IT'S ME
THE OTHER GOT CAREFULLY ERECT AND THE LOUD YOUNG SOLDIER LED HIM AMONG THE SLEEPING FORMS LYING IN GROUPS AND ROWS
THEN THE PRINCE PROMISED TO GIVE HIM ONE GOLD PIECE FOR EACH PIECE OF WISDOM THE PLOUGHMAN AGREED AND SAID LISTEN ATTENTIVELY
MAY GIT A LOT A OTHER SICKNESSES TOO BY MORNIN
WE SHALL BE DRIVEN TO THE ALTERNATIVE EITHER OF TAKING REFUGE AT ONCE IN THE ARMS OF MONARCHY OR OF SPLITTING OURSELVES INTO AN INFINITY OF LITTLE JEALOUS CLASHING TUMULTUOUS COMMONWEALTHS THE WRETCHED NURSERIES OF UNCEASING DISCORD
THE CONFEDERACY MAY BE DISSOLVED AND THE CONFEDERATES PRESERVE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AS THIS GOVERNMENT IS COMPOSED OF SMALL REPUBLICS IT ENJOYS THE INTERNAL HAPPINESS OF EACH AND WITH RESPECT TO ITS EXTERNAL SITUATION
AND THIS IS THE TRUE QUESTION IN THE DISCUSSION OF WHICH WE ARE AT PRESENT INTERESTED SO FAR ARE THE SUGGESTIONS OF MONTESQUIEU FROM STANDING IN OPPOSITION TO A GENERAL UNION OF THE STATES THAT HE EXPLICITLY TREATS OF A CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC
TO ILLUSTRATE THE TENDENCY OF THE UNION TO REPRESS DOMESTIC FACTION AND INSURRECTION A DISTINCTION MORE SUBTLE THAN ACCURATE HAS BEEN RAISED BETWEEN A CONFEDERACY AND A CONSOLIDATION OF THE STATES THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FIRST IS SAID TO BE
THEY AT THE SAME TIME ADMONISH US TO LAMENT THAT THE VICES OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD PERVERT THE DIRECTION AND TARNISH THE LUSTRE OF THOSE BRIGHT TALENTS AND EXALTED ENDOWMENTS FOR WHICH THE FAVORED SOILS THAT PRODUCED THEM HAVE BEEN SO JUSTLY CELEBRATED
AND HAS RECEIVED THE SANCTION OF THE MOST APPROVED WRITERS ON THE SUBJECT OF POLITICS THE OPPONENTS OF THE PLAN PROPOSED HAVE WITH GREAT ASSIDUITY CITED AND CIRCULATED THE OBSERVATIONS OF MONTESQUIEU ON THE NECESSITY OF A CONTRACTED TERRITORY FOR A REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT
OR HAVE MADE THEIR PRINCIPAL PROGRESS TOWARDS PERFECTION IN MODERN TIMES THEY ARE MEANS AND POWERFUL MEANS BY WHICH THE EXCELLENCES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT MAY BE RETAINED AND ITS IMPERFECTIONS LESSENED OR AVOIDED
IT WOULD STILL BE IN FACT AND IN THEORY AN ASSOCIATION OF STATES OR A CONFEDERACY THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION SO FAR FROM IMPLYING AN ABOLITION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS MAKES THEM CONSTITUENT PARTS OF THE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY
AND THE MISERABLE OBJECTS OF UNIVERSAL PITY OR CONTEMPT SOME OF THE WRITERS WHO HAVE COME FORWARD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION SEEM TO HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE DILEMMA AND HAVE EVEN BEEN BOLD ENOUGH TO HINT AT THE DIVISION OF THE LARGER STATES AS A DESIRABLE THING
AN EXACT EQUALITY OF SUFFRAGE BETWEEN THE MEMBERS HAS ALSO BEEN INSISTED UPON AS A LEADING FEATURE OF A CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT THESE POSITIONS ARE IN THE MAIN ARBITRARY THEY ARE SUPPORTED NEITHER BY PRINCIPLE NOR PRECEDENT
BY ALLOWING THEM A DIRECT REPRESENTATION IN THE SENATE AND LEAVES IN THEIR POSSESSION CERTAIN EXCLUSIVE AND VERY IMPORTANT PORTIONS OF SOVEREIGN POWER THIS FULLY CORRESPONDS IN EVERY RATIONAL IMPORT OF THE TERMS WITH THE IDEA OF A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
WHICH WILL BE EQUALLY PERMANENT MONUMENTS OF THEIR ERRORS BUT IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT THE PORTRAITS THEY HAVE SKETCHED OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT WERE TOO JUST COPIES OF THE ORIGINALS FROM WHICH THEY WERE TAKEN
TILL THEY ARRIVE TO SUCH A DEGREE OF POWER AS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED BODY A REPUBLIC OF THIS KIND ABLE TO WITHSTAND AN EXTERNAL FORCE MAY SUPPORT ITSELF WITHOUT ANY INTERNAL CORRUPTIONS
NOR GEORGIA CAN BY ANY MEANS BE COMPARED WITH THE MODELS FROM WHICH HE REASONED AND TO WHICH THE TERMS OF HIS DESCRIPTION APPLY IF WE THEREFORE TAKE HIS IDEAS ON THIS POINT AS THE CRITERION OF TRUTH
HAD THEY NOT CONTRIVED A KIND OF CONSTITUTION THAT HAS ALL THE INTERNAL ADVANTAGES OF A REPUBLICAN TOGETHER WITH THE EXTERNAL FORCE OF A MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT I MEAN A CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC
WHICH HAVE FLOURISHED FOR AGES HAVE IN A FEW GLORIOUS INSTANCES REFUTED THEIR GLOOMY SOPHISMS AND I TRUST AMERICA WILL BE THE BROAD AND SOLID FOUNDATION OF OTHER EDIFICES NOT LESS MAGNIFICENT
IT IS POSSESSED BY MEANS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF LARGE MONARCHIES I HAVE THOUGHT IT PROPER TO QUOTE AT LENGTH THESE INTERESTING PASSAGES BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN A LUMINOUS ABRIDGMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF THE UNION
SUCH AN INFATUATED POLICY SUCH A DESPERATE EXPEDIENT MIGHT BY THE MULTIPLICATION OF PETTY OFFICES ANSWER THE VIEWS OF MEN WHO POSSESS NOT QUALIFICATIONS TO EXTEND THEIR INFLUENCE BEYOND THE NARROW CIRCLES OF PERSONAL INTRIGUE
SHOULD A POPULAR INSURRECTION HAPPEN IN ONE OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES THE OTHERS ARE ABLE TO QUELL IT SHOULD ABUSES CREEP INTO ONE PART THEY ARE REFORMED BY THOSE THAT REMAIN SOUND THE STATE MAY BE DESTROYED ON ONE SIDE AND NOT ON THE OTHER
AND MUST EFFECTUALLY REMOVE THE FALSE IMPRESSIONS WHICH A MISAPPLICATION OF OTHER PARTS OF THE WORK WAS CALCULATED TO MAKE THEY HAVE AT THE SAME TIME AN INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH THE MORE IMMEDIATE DESIGN OF THIS PAPER WHICH IS
WITHOUT FEELING SENSATIONS OF HORROR AND DISGUST AT THE DISTRACTIONS WITH WHICH THEY WERE CONTINUALLY AGITATED AND AT THE RAPID SUCCESSION OF REVOLUTIONS BY WHICH THEY WERE KEPT IN A STATE OF PERPETUAL VIBRATION BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF TYRANNY AND ANARCHY
BUT THEY SEEM NOT TO HAVE BEEN APPRISED OF THE SENTIMENTS OF THAT GREAT MAN EXPRESSED IN ANOTHER PART OF HIS WORK NOR TO HAVE ADVERTED TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PRINCIPLE TO WHICH THEY SUBSCRIBE
ARE MERE MATTERS OF DISCRETION SO LONG AS THE SEPARATE ORGANIZATION OF THE MEMBERS BE NOT ABOLISHED SO LONG AS IT EXISTS BY A CONSTITUTIONAL NECESSITY FOR LOCAL PURPOSES THOUGH IT SHOULD BE IN PERFECT SUBORDINATION TO THE GENERAL AUTHORITY OF THE UNION
IF THEY EXHIBIT OCCASIONAL CALMS THESE ONLY SERVE AS SHORT LIVED CONTRAST TO THE FURIOUS STORMS THAT ARE TO SUCCEED IF NOW AND THEN INTERVALS OF FELICITY OPEN TO VIEW WE BEHOLD THEM WITH A MIXTURE OF REGRET
THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS A CONVENTION BY WHICH SEVERAL SMALLER STATES AGREE TO BECOME MEMBERS OF A LARGER ONE WHICH THEY INTEND TO FORM IT IS A KIND OF ASSEMBLAGE OF SOCIETIES THAT CONSTITUTE A NEW ONE CAPABLE OF INCREASING BY MEANS OF NEW ASSOCIATIONS
THE LATTER IS THAT WHICH IMMEDIATELY CONCERNS THE OBJECT UNDER CONSIDERATION IT WILL HOWEVER BE OF USE TO EXAMINE THE PRINCIPLE IN ITS APPLICATION TO A SINGLE STATE WHICH SHALL BE ATTENDED TO IN ANOTHER PLACE THE UTILITY OF A CONFEDERACY
KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES THE BONES OF KING EDWARD THE MARTYR CAREFULLY REMOVED HITHER FOR HOLY PRESERVATION BROUGHT SHASTON A RENOWN WHICH MADE IT THE RESORT OF PILGRIMS FROM EVERY PART OF EUROPE
OUT OF THE DEEP ALLUVIAL VALE OF BLACKMOOR THE VIEW FROM THE CASTLE GREEN OVER THREE COUNTIES OF VERDANT PASTURE SOUTH MID AND NETHER WESSEX BEING AS SUDDEN A SURPRISE TO THE UNEXPECTANT TRAVELLER'S EYES

IT IS QUITE LIKE THE GENUINE ARTICLE ALL CUT UP INTO VERSES TOO SO THAT IT IS LIKE ONE OF THE OTHER EVANGELISTS READ IN A DREAM WHEN THINGS ARE THE SAME YET NOT THE SAME
HE DID WAIT HOWEVER AND AT LAST A SMALL HIRED VEHICLE PULLED UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL AND A PERSON ALIGHTED THE CONVEYANCE GOING BACK WHILE THE PASSENGER BEGAN ASCENDING THE HILL HE KNEW HER
A FASTIDIOUSNESS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE CALLED ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT RESPECT AND BE GRATEFUL TO HIM I AM MERELY PUTTING A CASE OUGHT SHE TO TRY TO OVERCOME HER PRUDERIES JUDE THREW A TROUBLED LOOK AT HER
I PERCEIVE I HAVE SAID THAT IN MERE CONVENTION HONESTLY I DON'T THINK I AM SORRY IT DOES NOT MATTER EITHER WAY SAD TO SAY AS THEY HAD OVERDONE THE GRASP OF HANDS SOME TIME SOONER SHE TOUCHED HIS FINGERS BUT LIGHTLY WHEN HE WENT OUT NOW
AS STRANGE WILD BIRDS ARE SEEN ASSEMBLED ON SOME LOFTY PROMONTORY MEDITATIVELY PAUSING FOR LONGER FLIGHTS OR TO RETURN BY THE COURSE THEY FOLLOWED THITHER SO HERE IN THIS CLIFF TOWN STOOD IN STULTIFIED SILENCE THE YELLOW AND GREEN CARAVANS
AND WHERE THERE WERE MORE WANTON WOMEN THAN HONEST WIVES AND MAIDS IT IS ALSO SAID THAT AFTER THE MIDDLE AGES THE INHABITANTS WERE TOO POOR TO PAY THEIR PRIESTS AND HENCE WERE COMPELLED TO PULL DOWN THEIR CHURCHES AND REFRAIN ALTOGETHER FROM THE PUBLIC WORSHIP OF GOD
THAT THOUGH I LIKE MISTER PHILLOTSON AS A FRIEND I DON'T LIKE HIM IT IS A TORTURE TO ME TO LIVE WITH HIM AS A HUSBAND THERE NOW I HAVE LET IT OUT I COULDN'T HELP IT ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN PRETENDING I AM HAPPY
SUCH IS AND SUCH WAS THE NOW WORLD FORGOTTEN SHASTON OR PALLADOUR ITS SITUATION RENDERED WATER THE GREAT WANT OF THE TOWN AND WITHIN LIVING MEMORY HORSES DONKEYS AND MEN MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN TOILING UP THE WINDING WAYS TO THE TOP OF THE HEIGHT
THE FAINT CLICK OF THE TRAP AS DRAGGED ABOUT BY THE WRITHING ANIMAL GUIDED HIM NOW AND REACHING THE SPOT HE STRUCK THE RABBIT ON THE BACK OF THE NECK WITH THE SIDE OF HIS PALM AND IT STRETCHED ITSELF OUT DEAD

BUT I MUST TELL HIM WHO RICHARD OH
AT SOME TIME NEAR TWO O'CLOCK WHEN HE WAS BEGINNING TO SLEEP MORE SOUNDLY HE WAS AROUSED BY A SHRILL SQUEAK THAT HAD BEEN FAMILIAR ENOUGH TO HIM WHEN HE LIVED REGULARLY AT MARYGREEN IT WAS THE CRY OF A RABBIT CAUGHT IN A GIN
UNWILLING TO ENTER TILL THE CHILDREN WERE DISMISSED HE REMAINED HERE TILL YOUNG VOICES COULD BE HEARD IN THE OPEN AIR AND GIRLS IN WHITE PINAFORES OVER RED AND BLUE FROCKS APPEARED DANCING ALONG THE PATHS
DO YOU THINK JUDE THAT A MAN OUGHT TO MARRY A WOMAN HIS OWN AGE OR ONE YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF EIGHTEEN YEARS AS I AM THAN HE IT DEPENDS UPON WHAT THEY FEEL FOR EACH OTHER
SUE I SOMETIMES THINK YOU ARE A FLIRT SAID HE ABRUPTLY THERE WAS A MOMENTARY PAUSE TILL SHE SUDDENLY JUMPED UP AND TO HIS SURPRISE HE SAW BY THE KETTLE FLAME THAT HER FACE WAS FLUSHED
SUE DREW HERS AWAY THAT'S ABSURD SUE CRIED HE AFTER WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
WOULD HAVE SHUNNED SUCH ENCOUNTERS IF THEY DOUBTED THEIR OWN STRENGTH BUT HE COULD NOT
WHY SURELY A PERSON MAY SAY EVEN PROCLAIM UPON THE HOUSETOPS THAT IT HURTS AND GRIEVES HIM OR HER I HAVE SAID SO ANYHOW TO YOU PRESENTLY SHE WENT ON
HAVE TO THE REAL STAR PATTERNS I AM CALLED MISSUS RICHARD PHILLOTSON LIVING A CALM WEDDED LIFE WITH MY COUNTERPART OF THAT NAME BUT I AM NOT REALLY MISSUS RICHARD PHILLOTSON BUT A WOMAN TOSSED ABOUT

LADEN WITH TUBS AND BARRELS FILLED FROM THE WELLS BENEATH THE MOUNTAIN AND HAWKERS RETAILING THEIR CONTENTS AT THE PRICE OF A HALFPENNY A BUCKETFUL THIS DIFFICULTY IN THE WATER SUPPLY TOGETHER WITH TWO OTHER ODD FACTS
AND AGAIN QUESTIONED HIS DEVOTIONAL MOTTO THAT ALL WAS FOR THE BEST HE RETIRED TO REST EARLY BUT HIS SLEEP WAS FITFUL FROM THE SENSE THAT SUE WAS SO NEAR AT HAND
YES PARTICULARLY FOR MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY
SHE SHAKES DOWN TO WITH COMFORTABLE INDIFFERENCE IN HALF A DOZEN YEARS BUT THAT IS MUCH LIKE SAYING THAT THE AMPUTATION OF A LIMB IS NO AFFLICTION SINCE A PERSON GETS COMFORTABLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE USE OF A WOODEN LEG OR ARM IN THE COURSE OF TIME
HE DESPATCHED THE NOTE ON EASTER EVE AND THERE SEEMED A FINALITY IN THEIR DECISIONS BUT OTHER FORCES AND LAWS THAN THEIRS WERE IN OPERATION ON EASTER MONDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE WIDOW EDLIN
NOW THE LAST TIE BETWEEN US AUNT DRUSILLA IS DEAD JUDE SEIZED HER HAND AND KISSED IT THERE IS A STRONGER ONE LEFT HE SAID I'LL NEVER CARE ABOUT MY DOCTRINES OR MY RELIGION ANY MORE LET THEM GO
VELAMIR KING OF THE OSTROGOTHS AND THE HEADS OF THE OTHER NATIONS TOOK ARMS AGAINST HIS SONS
WAS THE EXECUTION OF A RASH YOUTH WHO WITH A FEEBLE HAND HAD ASPIRED TO SEIZE THE REINS OF EMPIRE BUT THAT YOUTH WAS THE SON OF MARCELLUS THE GENERAL OF CAVALRY
A PLOUGHSHARE WAS DRAWN OVER THE CONSECRATED GROUND AS A SIGN OF PERPETUAL INTERDICTION
THE VENERABLE AGE OF GREECE EXCITED THE MOST TENDER COMPASSION IN THE MIND OF JULIAN WHICH KINDLED INTO RAPTURE WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THE GODS THE HEROES AND THE MEN SUPERIOR TO HEROES AND TO GODS WHO HAVE BEQUEATHED TO THE LATEST POSTERITY THE MONUMENTS OF THEIR GENIUS
THIS AS WILL BE RELATED IN ITS PLACE CAUSED THE ORIGIN OF VENICE
SHOWED NO LESS FOLLY IN THE PRINCES THEMSELVES THAN INFIDELITY IN THEIR MINISTERS
WHICH DIOCLETIAN CONSTANTINE AND THE PATIENT HABITS OF FOURSCORE YEARS HAD ESTABLISHED IN THE EMPIRE A MOTIVE OF SUPERSTITION PREVENTED THE EXECUTION OF THE DESIGN WHICH JULIAN HAD FREQUENTLY MEDITATED
THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION CONSIDERED FROM ONE SIDE COLONIZATION WHATEVER THE MOTIVES OF THE EMIGRANTS WAS AN ECONOMIC MATTER IT INVOLVED THE USE OF CAPITAL TO PAY FOR THEIR PASSAGE TO SUSTAIN THEM ON THE VOYAGE AND TO START THEM ON THE WAY OF PRODUCTION
AND WHICH WAS DUG OUT OF THE EARTH IN THE REIGN OF THOSE PRINCES
AS SEEMED NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXTRAORDINARY PRESERVATION AND SEASONABLE DISCOVERY WERE GRADUALLY PROPAGATED WITHOUT OPPOSITION THE CUSTODY OF THE TRUE CROSS WHICH ON EASTER SUNDAY WAS SOLEMNLY EXPOSED TO THE PEOPLE WAS INTRUSTED TO THE BISHOP OF
WHO WERE CONQUERED BY CAIUS MARIUS WAS THE VISIGOTHS WHICH NAME IN OUR LANGUAGE SIGNIFIES WESTERN GOTHS THESE AFTER SOME BATTLES FOUGHT ALONG ITS CONFINES LONG HELD THEIR SEAT OF DOMINION UPON THE DANUBE WITH CONSENT OF THE EMPERORS
BEING PRESSED BY THE VISIGOTHS AND UNABLE TO RESIST THEM WERE INVITED BY BONIFACE WHO GOVERNED AFRICA FOR THE EMPIRE TO OCCUPY THAT PROVINCE FOR BEING IN REBELLION HE WAS AFRAID HIS ERROR WOULD BECOME KNOWN TO THE EMPEROR
HAD PREPARED FOR HIS OWN USE A PURPLE GARMENT
AND AFTER THE DEATHS OF MANY EMPERORS THE EMPIRE OF CONSTANTINOPLE DEVOLVED UPON ZENO AND THAT OF ROME UPON ORESTES AND AUGUSTULUS HIS SON WHO OBTAINED THE SOVEREIGNTY BY FRAUD WHILE THEY WERE DESIGNING TO HOLD BY FORCE WHAT THEY HAD OBTAINED BY TREACHERY
UNDOUBTEDLY A VERY CONSIDERABLE NUMBER COULD DO SO FOR WE CAN TRACE THE FAMILY FORTUNES OF MANY EARLY SETTLERS HENRY CABOT LODGE IS AUTHORITY FOR THE STATEMENT THAT THE SETTLERS OF NEW ENGLAND WERE DRAWN
LIVING IN A HEALTHY AND PROLIFIC REGION FREQUENTLY INCREASE TO SUCH VAST MULTITUDES THAT PART OF THEM ARE COMPELLED TO ABANDON THEIR NATIVE SOIL AND SEEK A HABITATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES THE METHOD ADOPTED
AN EARTHQUAKE A WHIRLWIND AND A FIERY ERUPTION WHICH OVERTURNED AND SCATTERED THE NEW FOUNDATIONS OF THE TEMPLE
THE SLAVES NEARLY EQUALLED OR ACTUALLY EXCEEDED THE WHITES IN NUMBER IN SOUTH CAROLINA THEY FORMED ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THE POPULATION EVEN IN THE MIDDLE COLONIES OF DELAWARE AND PENNSYLVANIA ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF THE INHABITANTS WERE FROM AFRICA TO THE NORTH THE PROPORTION OF SLAVES STEADILY DIMINISHED
WHICH FROM THEMSELVES IS CALLED BRITTANY THE HUNS WHO WERE SAID ABOVE TO HAVE OCCUPIED PANNONIA
INCLUDING A FEW FREEDMEN THE CLIMATE THE SOIL THE COMMERCE AND THE INDUSTRY OF THE NORTH WERE ALL UNFAVORABLE TO THE GROWTH OF A SERVILE POPULATION STILL SLAVERY THOUGH SECTIONAL WAS A PART OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF ECONOMY
ORPHANS AND DEPENDENTS WERE SOMETIMES DISPOSED OF IN AMERICA BY RELATIVES UNWILLING TO SUPPORT THEM IN A SINGLE YEAR
OR EVEN TO SEAT THEMSELVES ON HIS VACANT THRONE THE PHILOSOPHER COULD EXCUSE THE HASTY SALLIES OF DISCONTENT AND THE HERO COULD DESPISE THE AMBITIOUS PROJECTS WHICH SURPASSED THE FORTUNE OR THE ABILITIES OF THE RASH CONSPIRATORS A CITIZEN OF ANCYRA
BUT THE PROSPECT OF AN IMMEDIATE AND IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE WOULD NOT SUFFER THE IMPATIENT MONARCH TO EXPECT THE REMOTE AND UNCERTAIN EVENT OF THE PERSIAN WAR
WHILST ALYPIUS ASSISTED BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE URGED WITH VIGOR AND DILIGENCE THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK HORRIBLE BALLS OF FIRE BREAKING OUT NEAR THE FOUNDATIONS WITH FREQUENT AND REITERATED ATTACKS
AND WHO ENDEAVORED ALWAYS TO CONNECT AUTHORITY WITH MERIT AND HAPPINESS WITH VIRTUE EVEN FACTION AND RELIGIOUS FACTION WAS CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPERIORITY OF HIS GENIUS IN PEACE AS WELL AS IN WAR AND TO CONFESS WITH A SIGH
UNDER THIS STERN ECONOMIC NECESSITY PURITANS SCOTCH IRISH GERMANS AND ALL WERE ALIKE LAID IMMIGRANTS WHO PAID THEIR OWN WAY
WHEN ONE OF THESE PROVINCES HAD TO BE RELIEVED OF ITS SUPERABUNDANT POPULATION WAS TO DIVIDE INTO THREE PARTS EACH CONTAINING AN EQUAL NUMBER OF NOBLES AND OF PEOPLE OF RICH AND OF POOR THE THIRD UPON WHOM THE LOT FELL
DEEPLY IMPRESSED WITH THESE SENTIMENTS WE MOST HUMBLY BESEECH YOUR MAJESTY TO REMOVE ALL THOSE RESTRAINTS ON YOUR MAJESTY'S GOVERNORS OF THIS COLONY WHICH INHIBIT THEIR ASSENTING TO SUCH LAWS AS MIGHT CHECK SO VERY PERNICIOUS A COMMERCE
THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF SLAVERY THERE WERE ONLY THREE HUNDRED AFRICANS IN VIRGINIA THE GREAT INCREASE IN LATER YEARS WAS DUE IN NO SMALL MEASURE TO THE INORDINATE ZEAL FOR PROFITS THAT SEIZED SLAVE TRADERS BOTH IN OLD AND IN NEW ENGLAND
THE CONDITION OF WHITE BONDMEN IN VIRGINIA ACCORDING TO LODGE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT OF SLAVES LOOSE INDENTURES AND HARSH LAWS PUT THEM AT THE MERCY OF THEIR MASTERS
TO MAKE THE VISIGOTHS THEIR ENEMIES HE ADVISED THAT THE ACCUSTOMED STIPEND ALLOWED TO THIS PEOPLE SHOULD BE WITHHELD AND AS HE THOUGHT THESE ENEMIES WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT ALONE TO DISTURB THE EMPIRE
AND HIS SUCCESSOR ASTOLPHUS HAVING MARRIED PLACIDIA SISTER OF THE EMPERORS AGREED WITH THEM TO GO TO THE RELIEF OF GAUL AND SPAIN WHICH PROVINCES HAD BEEN ASSAILED BY THE VANDALS BURGUNDIANS ALANS AND FRANKS FROM THE CAUSES BEFORE MENTIONED
ARGOS FOR HER DELIVERER THE PRIDE OF CORINTH AGAIN RISING FROM HER RUINS WITH THE HONORS OF A ROMAN COLONY EXACTED A TRIBUTE FROM THE ADJACENT REPUBLICS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEFRAYING THE GAMES OF THE ISTHMUS
AFTER THIS SEVERAL IMPORTANT EVENTS OCCURRED BOTH IN ITALY
I AM SURE YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU MEANT WHAT YOU SAID WHEN YOU SAID IT NO I DIDN'T PUT IN LADY HARRIET AND BESIDES IF YOU DIDN'T
HOW EMPTY OF ANYTHING BUT DEAL TABLES AND FORMS AND MATS OH INDEED CLARE I QUITE AGREE WITH MAMMA
TO MARLBOROUGH MILLS I SUPPOSE SIR NO MISTER THORNTON SAID GIVE THE BASKET TO ME I'LL TAKE IT IT TOOK UP BOTH HIS HANDS TO CARRY IT
SHE IS VERY FANCIFUL IS DEAR LADY HARRIET I WOULD NOT LIKE HER TO THINK WE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE IN OUR MEALS BECAUSE SHE STAYED SIMPLE ELEGANCE AS I TELL HER ALWAYS IS WHAT WE AIM AT BUT STILL YOU COULD PUT OUT THE BEST SERVICE AND ARRANGE SOME FLOWERS
HE WAS SHARP TO THE HOUR AT THE MEETING OF HIS BROTHER MAGISTRATES GIVING THEM THE BEST ASSISTANCE OF HIS STRONG SENSE
MOLLY DARLING THERE'S A VERY COLD WIND THOUGH IT LOOKS SO FINE YOU HAD BETTER PUT ON MY INDIAN SHAWL AND IT WILL LOOK SO PRETTY TOO ON YOUR GREY GOWN SCARLET AND GREY IT'S NOT EVERYBODY I WOULD LEND IT TO BUT YOU'RE SO CAREFUL THANK YOU SAID MOLLY
BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE PRETTY MISS KIRKPATRICK WITH FRESH INTEREST HER BROTHER HAD SPOKEN IN SUCH A MANNER OF THIS YOUNG MISTER HAMLEY THAT EVERY ONE CONNECTED WITH THE PHOENIX WAS WORTHY OF OBSERVATION THEN
BY THE WAY YOU'VE RECOMMENDED ME A GOOD PATIENT POOR LADY NOT TO GO ON TALKING IN THIS HEARTLESS WAY I SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT MISSUS HALE THAT LADY IN CRAMPTON YOU KNOW HASN'T MANY WEEKS TO LIVE I NEVER HAD ANY HOPE OF CURE AS I THINK I TOLD YOU
WOULD MELT THEM ALL AWAY I HAVE NOT TASTED SUCH FRUIT NO NOT EVEN IN HAMPSHIRE SINCE I WAS A BOY AND TO BOYS I FANCY ALL FRUIT IS GOOD I REMEMBER EATING SLOES AND CRABS WITH A RELISH DO YOU REMEMBER THE MATTED UP CURRANT BUSHES MARGARET
THE WEBS THE DISTORTIONS OF TRUTH WHICH HAD PREVAILED IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD EVER SINCE HER FATHER'S SECOND MARRIAGE SHE KNEW THAT VERY OFTEN SHE LONGED TO PROTEST
THESE OBSTACLES WERE NOT UNLIKE THE SHIELD OF THE KNIGHT IN THE OLD STORY ONLY INSTEAD OF THE TWO SIDES PRESENTED TO THE TWO TRAVELLERS APPROACHING IT FROM OPPOSITE QUARTERS ONE OF WHICH WAS SILVER AND ONE OF WHICH WAS GOLD LADY HARRIET SAW THE SMOOTH AND SHINING YELLOW RADIANCE
MISSUS GIBSON FOUND THE CHANCES OF INTERCOURSE WITH THE TOWERS RATHER MORE PERSONALLY EXCITING THAN ROGER'S VISITS OR THE RARER CALLS OF OSBORNE HAMLEY CYNTHIA HAD AN OLD ANTIPATHY TO THE GREAT FAMILY WHO HAD MADE SO MUCH OF HER MOTHER AND SO LITTLE OF HER
AT THE THOUGHT OF THE UNVALUED TREASURE LYING AT CYNTHIA'S FEET AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MERELY UNSELFISH REGRET IT WAS THE OLD FERVID TENDERNESS
HER PRESENCE MADE THE CONVERSATION MORE GENERAL AND LADY HARRIET GAVE OUT SEVERAL PIECES OF NEWS NONE OF THEM OF ANY GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HER BUT AS WHAT HAD BEEN TALKED ABOUT BY THE CIRCLE OF VISITORS ASSEMBLED AT THE TOWERS
HE NEVER WAS GREAT IN GEOGRAPHY YOU KNOW AND SOMEHOW HE THOUGHT THAT METZ PRONOUNCED FRENCH FASHION MUST BE ON THE ROAD TO ROME SOME ONE HAD TOLD HIM SO IN FUN HOWEVER IT WAS VERY WELL FOR ME THAT I MET WITH HIM THERE
AS IT WAS HE LOOKED TO THE SPEEDY ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THAT ALONE IT WAS HIS MOTHER'S GREEDY EARS THAT SUCKED IN FROM THE WOMEN KIND OF THESE MAGISTRATES AND WEALTHY MEN HOW HIGHLY MISTER THIS OR MISTER THAT THOUGHT OF MISTER THORNTON THAT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THERE
AND WE WERE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY BUT SURELY SOME REGISTRATION OR CERTIFICATE WAS NECESSARY MORRISON SAID HE WOULD UNDERTAKE ALL THOSE FORMS AND HE OUGHT TO KNOW HIS OWN BUSINESS I KNOW I TIPPED HIM PRETTY WELL FOR THE JOB
BUT IT'S RATHER TIRESOME TO US PRIVATELY FOR IT KEEPS HOLLINGFORD IN TOWN OR BETWEEN IT AND CAMBRIDGE AND EACH PLACE AS DULL AND EMPTY AS CAN BE
VERY WICKED INDEED I THINK I MAY SAY
WELL WELL SHE DIED THIS MORNING AND HER SISTER IS HERE COME TO BEG A STRANGE THING IT SEEMS THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO DIED HAD A FANCY FOR BEING BURIED IN SOMETHING OF YOURS AND SO THE SISTER'S COME TO ASK FOR IT AND I WAS LOOKING FOR A NIGHT CAP THAT WASN'T TOO GOOD TO GIVE AWAY
SO ROGER WENT UP TO LONDON AND OSBORNE FOLLOWED HIM AND FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS THE GIBSONS SAW NOTHING OF THE BROTHERS BUT AS WAVE SUCCEEDS TO WAVE SO INTEREST SUCCEEDS TO INTEREST THE FAMILY AS THEY WERE CALLED CAME DOWN FOR THEIR AUTUMN SOJOURN AT THE TOWERS
AT THE CORNER OF THE WEST WALL IN THE GARDEN AT HOME DID SHE NOT DID SHE NOT REMEMBER EVERY WEATHER STAIN ON THE OLD STONE WALL THE GRAY AND YELLOW LICHENS THAT MARKED IT LIKE A MAP THE LITTLE CRANE'S BILL THAT GREW IN THE CREVICES SHE HAD BEEN SHAKEN BY THE EVENTS OF THE LAST TWO DAYS
BUT HE IS OBLIGED OR FANCIES HIMSELF OBLIGED WHICH IS ALL THE SAME THING TO STAY IN TOWN ABOUT THIS CRICHTON LEGACY A LEGACY TO LORD HOLLINGFORD I AM SO GLAD DON'T BE IN A HURRY TO BE GLAD IT'S NOTHING FOR HIM BUT TROUBLE
HE IS VERY AGREEABLE VERY ONLY WE SEE SO LITTLE OF HIM AND OF COURSE HE COMES HOME TIRED AND HUNGRY
I TOLD HER YOU WOULDN'T I WILL GO DOWN AND SPEAK TO HER SAID MARGARET AFRAID LEST DIXON'S HARSHNESS OF MANNER MIGHT WOUND THE POOR GIRL SO TAKING THE CAP IN HER HAND
FOR HE IS A FELLOW OF TRINITY SENIOR WRANGLER OR SOMETHING AND THEY'RE NOT SO FOOLISH AS TO SEND THEIR CRACK MAN TO BE EATEN UP BY LIONS AND TIGERS IT MUST BE ROGER HAMLEY EXCLAIMED CYNTHIA HER EYES BRIGHTENING AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHING HE'S NOT THE ELDEST SON
IF IT HAD BEEN OTHERWISE
YES IT WAS CERTAINLY THEIR FAULT NOT YOURS AND THEN YOU KNOW THE CONVENTIONS OF SOCIETY AH WHAT TRAMMELS THEY ARE LADY HARRIET WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE SAID TELL ME CLARE YOU'VE TOLD LIES SOMETIMES HAVEN'T YOU
MISSUS HALE LAY ON THE SOFA HEATED WITH FEVER MISTER HALE WAS READING ALOUD MARGARET WAS WORKING ON A LOW STOOL BY HER MOTHER'S SIDE HER HEART FLUTTERED IF HIS DID NOT AT THIS INTERVIEW BUT HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER
BECAUSE YOU'VE FRETTING ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH AND I KNOW YOU'LL FRET ABOUT THIS
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO COMING EVENTS ROGER HAD TURNED OVER MANY PLANS IN HIS MIND BY WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD OBTAIN SUFFICIENT MONEY FOR THE PURPOSE HE DESIRED TO ACCOMPLISH HIS CAREFUL GRANDFATHER WHO HAD BEEN A MERCHANT IN THE CITY
FROM THE DESIRE OF SPARING HER FATHER ANY DISCORD AND SHE SAW BY HIS FACE THAT HE TOO WAS OCCASIONALLY AWARE OF CERTAIN THINGS THAT GAVE HIM PAIN
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MISERABLE IF I EVER HAD
IN YOUR OWN CASE YOU HAVE GOT HOLD OF SOME ABSURD NOTION THAT THE MAN JOHN MARBURY WAS IN REALITY ONE JOHN MAITLAND ONCE OF MARKET MILCASTER
SPARGO TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIM
AND THE BUILDINGS ACROSS ON THE SURREY SIDE TEN MINUTES WENT BY TWENTY MINUTES NOTHING HAPPENED THEN AS HALF PAST NINE STRUCK FROM ALL THE NEIGHBOURING CLOCKS SPARGO FLUNG AWAY A SECOND CIGARETTE
WHAT WOULD HE DO WHAT WOULD HE SAY WHAT BRETON SAT DOWN QUIETLY AT HIS DESK AND LOOKED SPARGO HARD BETWEEN THE EYES PROVE THAT TO ME SPARGO HE SAID IN HARD MATTER OF FACT TONES
ALL RIGHT SAID BRETON HE TURNED AWAY TOWARDS SPARGO WHO HAD ALREADY MOVED OFF WHAT NEXT HE ASKED CHARING CROSS I SUPPOSE SPARGO SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD NO HE ANSWERED I'VE NO USE FOR CHARING CROSS
AT ANY RATE HERE SHE WAS AND HER DESTINATION WAS SURELY ELPHICK'S CHAMBERS AND THE QUESTION FOR HIM SPARGO WAS WHAT TO DO WHAT SPARGO DID WAS TO REMAIN IN ABSOLUTE SILENCE MOTIONLESS TENSE
THE CURTAIN RANG UP ON THE THIRD ACT AND BEATRICE SEATED WELL BACK IN THE SHADOWS FOLLOWED THE PLAY ATTENTIVELY APPRECIATED ITS GOOD POINTS AND HAD EVERY APPEARANCE OF BOTH UNDERSTANDING AND ENJOYING IT AFTERWARDS SHE ROSE PROMPTLY TO HER FEET STILL CLAPPING
SHE WENT ON RUMINATINGLY THE HOTEL WHERE MISTER DANE SENT ME IT'S NICE ENOUGH IN ITS WAY BUT VERY STUFFY AS REGARDS THE PEOPLE IS TWICE AS EXPENSIVE AS IT WOULD BE IN LONDON HOWEVER WE SHALL SEE
SAID SPARGO THIS FLIGHT OF ELPHICK'S AND CARDLESTONE'S I THINK AS I SAID THAT THEY KNEW SOMETHING WHICH THEY THINK MAY BE FORCED UPON THEM
THERE WAS A WINDOW HALF WAY ALONG THE CORRIDOR FROM WHICH HE HAD NOTICED AS HE CAME ALONG ONE COULD CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE EMBANKMENT AND THE THAMES TO THIS HE WITHDREW AND LEANING ON THE SILL LOOKED OUT AND CONSIDERED MATTERS SHOULD HE GO
HE DIDN'T TELL ME HE ONLY TOLD ME THIS MORNING WHAT WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU SPARGO PICKED UP HIS HAT GOOD NIGHT MISTER ELPHICK HE SAID BUT BEFORE HE COULD REACH THE DOOR THE OLD BARRISTER HAD LEAPT FROM HIS CHAIR AND SEIZED HIM WITH TREMBLING HANDS
HE LOOKED OVER THE BANISTERS DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW BENEATH AND THERE MARCHING UP RESOLUTELY
BEATRICE REPLACED THE PROGRAMME WHICH SHE HAD BEEN STUDYING ON THE LEDGE OF THE BOX AND TURNED TOWARDS PHILIP WHO WAS SEATED IN THE BACKGROUND THERE WAS SOMETHING A LITTLE NEW IN HER MANNER HER TONE WAS SUBDUED HER EYES CURIOUS
SPARGO WENT ROUND AGAIN TO THE TEMPLE THAT NIGHT AT NINE O'CLOCK ASKING HIMSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST HOW MUCH DOES ELPHICK KNOW THE SECOND HOW MUCH SHALL I TELL HIM
YOU WON'T BE ASHAMED TO BE SEEN ANYWHERE WITH ME THEN HE DREW HIS CHAIR UP TO HER SIDE A LITTLE HAGGARD AND WORN WITH THE SUSPENSE OF THE EVENING SHE LAUGHED AT HIM MOCKINGLY WHAT AN IDIOT YOU ARE SHE EXCLAIMED
ELIZABETH TURNED AND SMILED AT HIM SYMPATHETICALLY YOUR COMING MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER A SHOCK SHE REMINDED BEATRICE
AND IF HE COULD GAIN ADMITTANCE BEARD THESE TWO CONSPIRATORS SHOULD HE WAIT UNTIL THE WOMAN CAME OUT AND LET HER SEE THAT HE WAS ON THE TRACK SHOULD HE HIDE AGAIN UNTIL SHE WENT AND THEN SEE ELPHICK ALONE
RECOVERED HIMSELF GRIPPED THE CHAIR'S ARMS AND STARED AT SPARGO AS IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED TO HIM THAT IN ANOTHER MINUTE HE MUST BE LED TO INSTANT EXECUTION AND SPARGO QUICK TO SEE HIS ADVANTAGE FOLLOWED IT UP
AND BEING AFRAID THEIR FIRST INSTINCT IS TO RUN THEY'VE RUN AT THE FIRST ALARM FOOLISH BUT INSTINCTIVE BRETON WHO HAD FLUNG HIMSELF INTO THE ELBOW CHAIR AT HIS DESK
IF YOU CAN FORGET SO SOON HE MUTTERED I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SHE MADE A LITTLE GRIMACE BUT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS HE SAW THE COLD TIGHTENING OF HER LIPS LISTEN PHILIP SHE SAID
HER LIPS CAME TOGETHER IN FAMILIAR FASHION I MEAN IT TO SHE DECLARED I AM GOING TO MAKE A START TO MORROW I WISH MISS DALSTAN YOU COULD GET PHILIP TO LOOK AT THINGS A LITTLE MORE CHEERFULLY HE HAS BEEN LIKE A GHOST EVER SINCE I ARRIVED
I HAVE NO CURIOSITY MISTER ELPHICK HE SAID I AM CHARGED BY MY PAPER TO INVESTIGATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH OF THE MAN WHO WAS FOUND IN MIDDLE TEMPLE LANE AND IF POSSIBLE TO TRACK HIS MURDERER AND
YOU REALLY ARE A WONDERFUL PERSON PHILIP SHE DECLARED
BUT HE'S GONE AND ALL THE SHUDDERS AND MORBID REGRETS IN THE WORLD WON'T BRING HIM BACK AGAIN AND I AM HERE IN NEW YORK AND TO MORROW I SHALL HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS AND TO NIGHT I AM WITH YOU WATCHING YOUR PLAY THAT'S LIFE ENOUGH FOR ME AT PRESENT NO MORE NO LESS
ACCORDINGLY HE WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR INTO WHICH HE HAD SEEN MISS BAYLIS TURN HE KNEW THAT ALL THE DOORS IN THAT HOUSE WERE DOUBLE ONES AND THAT THE OUTER OAK IN EACH WAS SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH TO BE SOUND PROOF YET
WELL HE GROWLED MY DEAR YOUNG GENTLEMAN IMPLORED MISTER ELPHICK DON'T GO I'LL I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU IF
MARCHED STRAIGHT DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND KNOCKED BOLDLY AT MISTER ELPHICK'S DOOR GREATLY TO SPARGO'S SURPRISE THE DOOR WAS OPENED BEFORE THERE WAS ANY NECESSITY TO KNOCK AGAIN AND THERE CALMLY CONFRONTING HIM
AND HE'S NEVER GIVEN YOU ANY DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF ANY SORT TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF THAT STORY NEVER I NEVER QUESTIONED HIS STATEMENT WHY SHOULD I YOU NEVER REMEMBER ANYTHING OF YOUR CHILDHOOD
AND WHAT WAS THAT THAT MY PARENTS WERE OLD FRIENDS OF HIS WHO DIED YOUNG LEAVING ME UNPROVIDED FOR AND THAT HE TOOK ME UP AND LOOKED AFTER ME
PARDON ME SIR SAID SHE WITH DIGNITY COMPANY ARE INQUIRING FOR YOU IN THE OTHER ROOM AND SHE TURNED TO ME THEN YOU MUST PLEAD FOR ME HELEN SAID HE AND AT LENGTH WITHDREW
AND THE SOUND WAS AS THE SOUND OF A GROAN THE SERVANTS OPENED THE DOOR AND FOUND HIM DEAD AND WITH EXCLAMATIONS OF PITY RAISED HIM AND CARRIED HIM HOME TO HIS MOTHER FOR HIS FATHER WAS NOT LIVING
WHO HAD BRAVER MEN WHO HAD FAIRER OR SWIFTER HORSES OR GREYHOUNDS WHO HAD MORE SKILFUL OR WISER BARDS THAN MAELGAN
OR MADE HIM SENSIBLE OF THE WRONG IF IT HAD ONLY ARISEN FROM THOUGHTLESSNESS BUT I FELT IT TOO DEEPLY TO DO ANYTHING BUT RISE FROM THE MUSIC STOOL AND THROW MYSELF BACK ON THE SOFA SUPPRESSING WITH DIFFICULTY
I HAVE BEEN FORMED A COMELY PERSON ALTHOUGH I AM BUT LITTLE I AM HIGHLY GIFTED INTO A DARK LEATHERN BAG I WAS THROWN AND ON A BOUNDLESS SEA I WAS SENT ADRIFT FROM SEAS AND FROM MOUNTAINS
AND AS SUCH IS INVOKED BY THOMSON BEAR ME POMONA TO THY CITRON GROVES TO WHERE THE LEMON AND THE PIERCING LIME WITH THE DEEP ORANGE GLOWING THROUGH THE GREEN THEIR LIGHTER GLORIES BLEND
AND MAELGAN ASKED THE BOY TALIESIN WHAT WAS HIS ERRAND AND HE ANSWERED HIM IN SONG ELPHIN THE SON OF GWYDDNO IS IN THE LAND OF ARTRO SECURED BY THIRTEEN LOCKS FOR PRAISING HIS INSTRUCTOR
AND CONSTRUING YOUR SILENCE INTO YES I'LL TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT I WAS THE SUBJECT OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND THE CAUSE OF YOUR AFFLICTION INDEED SIR IF YOU DENY IT I WON'T TELL YOU MY SECRET THREATENED HE
BUT A LEATHERN BAG UPON A POLE OF THE WEIR THEN SAID THE WEIR WARD UNTO ELPHIN ALL THY ILL LUCK AFORETIME WAS NOTHING TO THIS AND NOW THOU HAST DESTROYED THE VIRTUES OF THE WEIR
WHEREFORE HE CAUSED HIS MISTRESS
WHEN IT STRIKES ON COASTS IT IS IN THE FIELD IT IS IN THE WOOD BUT THE EYE CANNOT PERCEIVE IT ONE BEING HAS PREPARED IT BY A TREMENDOUS BLAST TO WREAK VENGEANCE ON
AND SEE WHAT I SHALL THINK OF IT TO MORROW I WENT DOWN TO DINNER RESOLVING TO BE CHEERFUL AND WELL CONDUCTED AND KEPT MY RESOLUTION VERY CREDITABLY CONSIDERING HOW MY HEAD ACHED
AND THEN HE TRIED TO WIN HER DOMESTICS TO HIS SIDE SOMETIMES HE COMMITTED HIS VOWS TO WRITTEN TABLETS AND OFTEN HUNG AT HER DOOR GARLANDS WHICH HE HAD MOISTENED WITH HIS TEARS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF ON HER THRESHOLD
AND FAVOURED HIM WITH TWO OF HIS FAVOURITE SONGS IN SUCH SUPERIOR STYLE THAT EVEN I SOON LOST MY ANGER IN ADMIRATION AND LISTENED WITH A SORT OF GLOOMY PLEASURE TO THE SKILFUL MODULATIONS OF HER FULL TONED
I WAS IN INDIA WHEN ROME WAS BUILT I HAVE NOW COME HERE TO THE REMNANT OF TROIA WHEN THE KING AND HIS NOBLES HAD HEARD THE SONG THEY WONDERED MUCH FOR THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE FROM A BOY SO YOUNG AS HE
THERE NOW SAID SHE PLAYFULLY RUNNING HER FINGERS OVER THE KEYS WHEN SHE HAD CONCLUDED THE SECOND SONG WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU NEXT BUT IN SAYING THIS
AND WHEN THE KING KNEW THAT HE WAS THE BARD OF ELPHIN
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY PASSED BY THE CORNER WHEREIN HE WAS CROUCHING TALIESIN POUTED OUT HIS LIPS AFTER THEM AND PLAYED BLERWM BLERWM WITH HIS FINGER UPON HIS LIPS NEITHER TOOK THEY MUCH NOTICE OF HIM AS THEY WENT BY
WHAT IS THE MATTER I COULD NOT ANSWER AT THE MOMENT YOU MUST AND SHALL TELL ME WAS ADDED MORE VEHEMENTLY AND THE SPEAKER THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BESIDE ME ON THE RUG
AND WHEN I THOUGHT HE HAD TURNED AWAY AGAIN ROSE AND INSTANTLY LEFT THE APARTMENT TAKING REFUGE IN MY FAVOURITE RESORT THE LIBRARY THERE WAS NO LIGHT THERE
YOU WILL DRIVE ME MAD WILL YOU BESTOW YOURSELF UPON ME YOU WILL HE CRIED NEARLY SQUEEZING ME TO DEATH IN HIS ARMS NO NO I EXCLAIMED STRUGGLING TO FREE MYSELF FROM HIM
AND I AM A PRESUMPTUOUS DOG TO DREAM OF POSSESSING SUCH A TREASURE BUT NEVERTHELESS I WOULD SOONER DIE THAN RELINQUISH HER IN FAVOUR OF THE BEST MAN THAT EVER WENT TO HEAVEN AND AS FOR HER HAPPINESS
AND KEPT HER ORCHARD LOCKED AND ALLOWED NOT MEN TO ENTER THE FAUNS AND SATYRS WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL THEY POSSESSED TO WIN HER AND SO WOULD OLD SYLVANUS WHO LOOKS YOUNG FOR HIS YEARS AND PAN WHO WEARS A GARLAND OF PINE LEAVES AROUND HIS HEAD
AND I HOPE IT WILL HAVE THE EFFECT TO MAKE YOU MORE MERCIFUL IPHIS WAS A YOUNG MAN OF HUMBLE PARENTAGE WHO SAW AND LOVED ANAXARETE A
IT IS THIS RESUMED HE THAT ANNABELLA WILMOT IN COMPARISON WITH YOU IS LIKE A FLAUNTING PEONY COMPARED WITH A SWEET WILD ROSEBUD GEMMED WITH DEW AND I LOVE YOU
THE HAMADRYADS WERE WOOD NYMPHS POMONA WAS OF THIS CLASS AND NO ONE EXCELLED HER IN LOVE OF THE GARDEN AND THE CULTURE OF FRUIT SHE CARED NOT FOR FORESTS AND RIVERS BUT LOVED THE CULTIVATED COUNTRY
THAT SHE NEVER FELT IT WHEN HE CUT OFF FROM HER HAND HER LITTLE FINGER WHEREON WAS THE SIGNET RING OF ELPHIN WHICH HE HAD SENT TO HIS WIFE AS A TOKEN A SHORT TIME BEFORE
MUCH THE SAME FEELINGS OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SADNESS AS I DID BUT THE LOOK SHE GAVE HIM PLAINLY SAID DO YOU CHOOSE FOR ME NOW I HAVE DONE ENOUGH FOR HIM AND WILL GLADLY EXERT MYSELF TO GRATIFY YOU
HER GOUTY UNCLE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE COMPANY AND MISSUS TOUCHETT NOT HAVING CULTIVATED RELATIONS WITH HER HUSBAND'S NEIGHBOURS WAS NOT WARRANTED IN EXPECTING VISITS FROM THEM SHE HAD HOWEVER A PECULIAR TASTE SHE LIKED TO RECEIVE CARDS
ONE DAY HOWEVER A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED THE TWO YOUNG PERSONS AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE RIVER STROLLED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND PERCEIVED LORD WARBURTON SITTING UNDER THE TREES AND ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION
DON'T SIT ALONE WITH THE GENTLEMEN LATE AT NIGHT YOU WERE VERY RIGHT TO TELL ME THEN SAID ISABEL I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT I'M VERY GLAD TO KNOW IT I SHALL ALWAYS TELL YOU HER AUNT ANSWERED WHENEVER I SEE YOU TAKING WHAT SEEMS TO ME TOO MUCH LIBERTY
THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GRAVELY ILL IN THE SPRING AND THE DOCTORS HAD WHISPERED TO RALPH THAT ANOTHER ATTACK WOULD BE LESS EASY TO DEAL WITH JUST NOW HE APPEARED DISBURDENED OF PAIN BUT RALPH COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF A SUSPICION THAT THIS WAS A SUBTERFUGE OF THE ENEMY
FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
THE PLACE ITSELF WAS SOVEREIGN HER UNCLE WAS MORE AND MORE A SORT OF GOLDEN GRANDFATHER AND RALPH WAS UNLIKE ANY COUSIN SHE HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED HER IDEA OF COUSINS HAVING TENDED TO GLOOM THEN
OH NO THEY'RE NOT ALL LIKE HIM
ISABEL ALWAYS FELT AN IMPULSE TO PULL OUT THE PINS NOT THAT SHE IMAGINED THEY INFLICTED ANY DAMAGE ON THE TOUGH OLD PARCHMENT BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HER HER AUNT MIGHT MAKE BETTER USE OF HER SHARPNESS
FOR WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED SOCIAL INTERCOURSE SHE HAD VERY LITTLE RELISH BUT NOTHING PLEASED HER MORE THAN TO FIND HER HALL TABLE WHITENED WITH OBLONG MORSELS OF SYMBOLIC PASTEBOARD SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS A VERY JUST WOMAN
MISSUS TOUCHETT GAVE A LITTLE LOOK OF DESPAIR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
AND ENTER THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS IT MATTERED LITTLE THAT HE HAD ASSURED HER THEY WERE A VERY DISMAL PLACE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO UNDERTAKE TO SWEEP THEM AND SET THEM IN ORDER IT WAS BUT HALF HOSPITALITY TO LET HER REMAIN OUTSIDE
BUT THE TWO FOR THE MOST PART SAT SILENT THE OLD MAN WITH HIS HEAD BACK AND HIS EYES CLOSED HIS WIFE OCCUPIED WITH HER KNITTING AND WEARING THAT APPEARANCE OF RARE PROFUNDITY WITH WHICH SOME LADIES CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR NEEDLES
BUT HIS WIFE REMAINED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY SHE PROLONGED HER VIGIL FOR SOMETHING LESS THAN AN HOUR AND THEN RISING OBSERVED TO ISABEL THAT IT WAS TIME THEY SHOULD BID THE GENTLEMEN GOOD NIGHT ISABEL HAD AS YET NO DESIRE TO GO TO BED
CRIED LORD WARBURTON STILL WITH HIS SONOROUS MIRTH MY EXCUSE FOR NOT ROWING IS THAT MY COUSIN ROWS SO WELL SAID RALPH SHE DOES EVERYTHING WELL SHE TOUCHES NOTHING THAT SHE DOESN'T ADORN
WHO WAS WAITING TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS GUARD IF THE MANOEUVRE SHOULD SUCCEED THERE WOULD BE LITTLE HOPE OF ANY GREAT RESISTANCE RALPH HAD ALWAYS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT HIS FATHER WOULD SURVIVE HIM THAT HIS OWN NAME WOULD BE THE FIRST GRIMLY CALLED
OF LAUGHING AT ALL THINGS BEGINNING WITH HIMSELF SUCH SLENDER FACULTY OF REVERENCE AS HE POSSESSED CENTRED WHOLLY UPON HIS FATHER FOR THE REST HE EXERCISED HIS WIT INDIFFERENTLY UPON HIS FATHER'S SON THIS GENTLEMAN'S WEAK LUNGS
WHO IF IT PLEASED HER TO HEAR IT SAID THAT HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE NUMEROUS WAS HAPPILY ABLE TO REFLECT THAT SUCH COMPLACENCY WAS NOT THE INDICATION OF A FEEBLE MIND INASMUCH AS THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS IN WHICH SHE EXCELLED
IN THE FOLDS OF THE NATIONAL BANNER ISABEL'S CHIEF DREAD IN LIFE AT THIS PERIOD OF HER DEVELOPMENT WAS THAT SHE SHOULD APPEAR NARROW MINDED WHAT SHE FEARED NEXT AFTERWARDS WAS THAT SHE SHOULD REALLY BE SO BUT SHE NEVERTHELESS
THE FIRST IMPRESSION HE HAD MADE ON HER HAD HAD WEIGHT BUT AT THE END OF AN EVENING SPENT IN HIS SOCIETY SHE SCARCE FELL SHORT OF SEEING HIM THOUGH QUITE WITHOUT LURIDITY AS A HERO OF ROMANCE
THERE ARE AS MANY POINTS OF VIEW IN THE WORLD AS THERE ARE PEOPLE OF SENSE TO TAKE THEM YOU MAY SAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM VERY NUMEROUS AMERICAN NEVER IN THE WORLD THAT'S SHOCKINGLY NARROW MY POINT OF VIEW THANK GOD IS PERSONAL
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I SHOULD WAIT FOR YOU MISSUS TOUCHETT ANSWERED
SHE WAS VERY CRITICAL HERSELF IT WAS INCIDENTAL TO HER AGE HER SEX AND HER NATIONALITY BUT SHE WAS VERY SENTIMENTAL AS WELL AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DRYNESS THAT SET HER OWN MORAL FOUNTAINS FLOWING NOW WHAT'S YOUR POINT OF VIEW
SAID ISABEL BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NICE
HE VERY SOON ESTABLISHED WITH HER A REPUTATION FOR TREATING EVERYTHING AS A JOKE AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO NEGLECT THE PRIVILEGES SUCH A REPUTATION CONFERRED
WOULD SAVOUR OF IMMODESTY EVEN OF ARROGANCE
POOR RALPH HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS OUTLOOK HABITUALLY SOMBRE LAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER CLOUD
AND TRANSFERRED THEM COLDLY TO HER NIECE
HIS USELESS LIFE HIS FANTASTIC MOTHER
OH I KNOW HE DOESN'T ROW HE'S TOO LAZY SAID HIS LORDSHIP INDICATING RALPH TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR HIS LAZINESS ISABEL REJOINED LOWERING HER VOICE A LITTLE AH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING
BUT WHICH HE HAD NOW CEASED TO ENJOY ISABEL ENJOYED IT LARGELY AND HANDLING THE REINS IN A MANNER WHICH APPROVED ITSELF TO THE GROOM AS KNOWING WAS NEVER WEARY OF DRIVING HER UNCLE'S CAPITAL HORSES THROUGH WINDING LANES AND BYWAYS
THE LIVELIEST WALTZES SEEMED TO FLOAT UPON THE AIR ISABEL OFTEN FOUND HERSELF IRRITATED BY THIS PERPETUAL FIDDLING
THOUGH YOU WOULD NEVER SUPPOSE IT WHEN HE OFFERED TO INVITE WHAT HE CALLED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND MAKE HER ACQUAINTED WITH ENGLISH SOCIETY SHE ENCOURAGED THE HOSPITABLE IMPULSE AND PROMISED IN ADVANCE TO HURL HERSELF INTO THE FRAY
SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
SO THAT AS THEY WAVERED WITH THEIR SUIT CASES THEY SLID AND ALMOST FELL THE WET SNOW DRENCHED THEIR GLOVES THE WATER UNDERFOOT SPLASHED THEIR ITCHING ANKLES THEY SCUFFLED INCH BY INCH FOR THREE BLOCKS IN FRONT OF HARRY HAYDOCK'S KENNICOTT SIGHED
THEY JOURNEYED FOR THREE AND A HALF MONTHS THEY SAW THE GRAND CANYON THE ADOBE WALLS OF SANTE FE AND IN A DRIVE FROM EL PASO INTO MEXICO THEIR FIRST FOREIGN LAND THEY JOGGED FROM SAN DIEGO AND LA JOLLA TO LOS ANGELES PASADENA
HE CAME TO PEN AND INK HE COULD ONLY JOT ROUGHLY DOWN THE OUTLINE OF HIS FAMOUS TALES AND BOTH SPELLING AND GRAMMAR WERE SADLY ASKEW BUT ANNE FELT THAT IF ANYONE POSSESSED OF THE GIFT COULD TAKE THAT SIMPLE RECORD OF A BRAVE ADVENTUROUS LIFE
THE MINIATURE JUNK AND THE ORIENTAL DRUM FROM SAN FRANCISCO CHINATOWN THE BLOCKS CARVED BY THE OLD FRENCHMAN IN SAN DIEGO THE LARIAT FROM SAN ANTONIO WILL YOU FORGIVE MUMMY FOR GOING AWAY WILL YOU SHE WHISPERED ABSORBED IN HUGH
AND THE LITTLE FRILLS OF LACE AT NECK AND SLEEVES WERE OF REAL VALENCIENNES LYING ON IT WAS A CARD WITH LESLIE'S LOVE WHAT HOURS OF WORK SHE MUST HAVE PUT ON IT SAID ANNE
MISS CORNELIA AND ME WAS TALKING IT OVER THE OTHER DAY
RIVERSIDE THROUGH TOWNS WITH BELL TOWERED MISSIONS AND ORANGE GROVES THEY VIEWED MONTEREY AND SAN FRANCISCO AND A FOREST OF SEQUOIAS THEY BATHED IN THE SURF AND CLIMBED FOOTHILLS AND DANCED THEY SAW A POLO GAME AND THE MAKING OF MOTION PICTURES
CAPTAIN JIM WAS ONE OF THOSE RARE AND INTERESTING PEOPLE WHO NEVER SPEAK BUT THEY SAY SOMETHING THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS AND THE WISDOM OF THE SERPENT WERE MINGLED IN HIS COMPOSITION IN DELIGHTFUL PROPORTIONS
SHE AIN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR IT AND YOU AIN'T BUT IT'S THERE AND NEITHER OF YOU CAN CROSS IT MY CHILDHOOD WASN'T VERY HAPPY BEFORE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES SAID ANNE
TOO DAMNED WET TO PAINT SIT DOWN AND TALK AND SO FOR TEN MINUTES SHE LIVED IN A ROMANTIC NOVEL HER ONLY STRUGGLE WAS IN COAXING KENNICOTT NOT TO SPEND ALL HIS TIME WITH THE TOURISTS FROM THE TEN THOUSAND OTHER GOPHER PRAIRIES
THEY GOT THE FEED STORE ALL FIXED UP AND A NEW SIGN ON IT BLACK AND GOLD THAT'LL IMPROVE THE APPEARANCE OF THE BLOCK A LOT SHE NOTED THAT THE FEW PEOPLE WHOM THEY PASSED WORE THEIR RAGGEDEST COATS FOR THE EVIL DAY
AND THE MATERIAL MUST HAVE COST MORE THAN SHE COULD REALLY AFFORD IT IS VERY SWEET OF HER BUT LESLIE WAS BRUSQUE AND CURT WHEN ANNE THANKED HER AND AGAIN THE LATTER FELT THROWN BACK UPON HERSELF
ASKING A HUNDRED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM HAD HE HAD ANY COLDS DID HE STILL DAWDLE OVER HIS OATMEAL WHAT ABOUT UNFORTUNATE MORNING INCIDENTS
WITH NEITHER THE LIGHT NOR THE WATER FOR COMPANY BUT IF OUR FRIENDS COME TO SEE US OFTEN WE'LL WEATHER IT THROUGH CAPTAIN JIM HAD AN ICE BOAT AND MANY A WILD GLORIOUS SPIN GILBERT AND ANNE AND LESLIE HAD OVER THE GLIB HARBOR ICE WITH HIM
HUGH WEPT WITH HER WAIT FOR MUMMY A SECOND SHE HASTENED DOWN TO THE CELLAR TO KENNICOTT HE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE FURNACE
KENNICOTT GOT IN ONLY ONE CONSIDERABLE NARRATIVE WHICH BEGAN SAY I NEVER KNEW DID YOU HARRY THAT IN THE CHICAGO DISTRICT THE KUTZ KAR SELLS AS WELL AS THE OVERLAND I NEVER THOUGHT MUCH OF THE KUTZ BUT I MET A GENTLEMAN ON THE TRAIN
HE HAD BEEN SPOILED BY AUNT BESSIE EVEN TO A RETURNED MOTHER HIS WHINING AND HIS TRICK OF SEVEN TIMES SNATCHING HER SILVER BRUSH WERE FATIGUING
HE SHOUTED IN THE POOL AT THE CORONADO AND HE SPOKE OF THOUGH HE DID NOTHING MORE RADICAL THAN SPEAK OF BUYING EVENING CLOTHES CAROL WAS TOUCHED BY HIS EFFORTS TO ENJOY PICTURE GALLERIES
SHE NOTED THAT ALL WINTER LONG THE CITIZENS HAD BEEN THROWING GARBAGE INTO THEIR BACK YARDS TO BE CLEANED UP IN SPRING
KENNICOTT DISCUSSED LAND PRICES WITH THEM HE WENT INTO THE MERITS OF THE SEVERAL SORTS OF MOTOR CARS WITH THEM HE WAS INTIMATE WITH TRAIN PORTERS AND HE INSISTED ON SEEING THE LUKE DAWSONS AT THEIR FLIMSY BUNGALOW IN PASADENA
WHEN I ALMOST HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT LESLIE DOESN'T DOESN'T LIKE ME SOMETIMES I SURPRISE A LOOK IN HER EYES THAT SEEMS TO SHOW RESENTMENT AND DISLIKE IT GOES SO QUICKLY BUT I'VE SEEN IT I'M SURE OF THAT AND IT HURTS ME CAPTAIN JIM
HIS DUTY OF VIEWING SIGHTS AND CURIOS PERFORMED WITH THOROUGHNESS UNCONSCIOUS OF HER HE STOOPED AND PEERED IN AT THE BLUE FLAMES AMONG THE COALS HE CLOSED THE DOOR BRISKLY AND MADE A WHIRLING GESTURE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND OUT OF PURE BLISS
IN WINTER CALIFORNIA IS FULL OF PEOPLE FROM IOWA AND NEBRASKA OHIO AND OKLAHOMA WHO HAVING TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THEIR FAMILIAR VILLAGES HASTEN TO SECURE AN ILLUSION OF NOT HAVING LEFT THEM
HE HAD SEEN TO IT THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL CELLAR SHOULD BE LARGE AND CLEAN THE SQUARE PILLARS WHITEWASHED AND THE BINS FOR COAL AND POTATOES AND TRUNKS CONVENIENT A GLOW FROM THE DRAFTS FELL ON THE SMOOTH GRAY CEMENT FLOOR AT HIS FEET
I KNOW LESLIE MOORE TOO WELL NOT TO BE SURE OF THAT THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW HER DRIVING HER GEESE DOWN THE HILL ON THE DAY I CAME TO FOUR WINDS SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION PERSISTED ANNE I FELT IT
HELL HOUND YOU OLD DEVIL HOW ARE YOU ANYWAY
EACH FELT LIFE THE RICHER FOR FRIENDLY EXCHANGE OF THOUGHT AND FRIENDLY SILENCE EACH LOOKED ACROSS THE WHITE FIELDS BETWEEN THEIR HOMES WITH A PLEASANT CONSCIOUSNESS OF A FRIEND BEYOND BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THIS
RATHER THAN THE LIFE SHE LIVED WITH DICK BEFORE HE WENT AWAY THAT'S SOMETHING A CLUMSY OLD SAILOR'S TONGUE MUSTN'T MEDDLE WITH BUT YOU'VE HELPED LESLIE A LOT SHE'S A DIFFERENT CREATURE SINCE YOU COME TO FOUR WINDS
I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT CARRIE WHAT THE DEUCE WAS THE NAME OF THAT FIRST STOP WE MADE THE OTHER SIDE OF ALBUQUERQUE WELL ANYWAY I GUESS
COME TO THIS SHORE WROTE ANNE TO PAUL I AM AFRAID YOU CANNOT FIND HERE NORA OR THE GOLDEN LADY OR THE TWIN SAILORS BUT YOU WILL FIND ONE OLD SAILOR WHO CAN TELL YOU WONDERFUL STORIES
THE HARBOR ICE GREW HARDER AND THICKER
WHO WERE JUST THEN ENGAGED WITH MISSUS LEIGH PERROT IN ARRANGING HER LATE HUSBAND'S AFFAIRS BUT AUNT JANE BECAME TOO ILL TO HAVE ME IN THE HOUSE AND SO I WENT INSTEAD TO MY SISTER MISSUS LEFROY AT WYARDS THE NEXT DAY WE WALKED OVER TO CHAWTON
AND PERHAPS SOMETIMES TO PERSUADE HERSELF THAT EXCEPTING WANT OF STRENGTH SHE WAS OTHERWISE VERY WELL BUT THE PROGRESS OF THE DISEASE BECAME MORE AND MORE MANIFEST AS THE YEAR ADVANCED THE USUAL WALK
TO MAKE ENQUIRIES AFTER OUR AUNT SHE WAS THEN KEEPING HER ROOM BUT SAID SHE WOULD SEE US AND WE WENT UP TO HER SHE WAS IN HER DRESSING GOWN AND WAS SITTING QUITE LIKE AN INVALID IN AN ARM CHAIR BUT SHE GOT UP AND KINDLY GREETED US AND THEN
I GIVE YOU JOY OF HAVING LEFT WINCHESTER NOW YOU MAY OWN HOW MISERABLE YOU WERE THERE NOW IT WILL GRADUALLY ALL COME OUT YOUR CRIMES AND YOUR MISERIES HOW OFTEN YOU WENT UP BY THE MAIL TO LONDON AND THREW AWAY FIFTY GUINEAS AT A TAVERN
IT HAS BEEN THE APPOINTMENT OF GOD HOWEVER SECONDARY CAUSES MAY HAVE OPERATED BUT THE ELASTICITY OF HER SPIRITS SOON RECOVERED THEIR TONE IT WAS IN THE LATTER HALF OF THAT YEAR
DECLINING HEALTH OF JANE AUSTEN ELASTICITY OF HER SPIRITS HER RESIGNATION AND HUMILITY HER DEATH EARLY IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN
YOU WILL HEAR FROM UNCLE HENRY HOW WELL ANNA IS SHE SEEMS PERFECTLY RECOVERED BEN WAS HERE ON SATURDAY TO ASK UNCLE CHARLES AND ME TO DINE WITH THEM AS TO MORROW BUT I WAS FORCED TO DECLINE IT THE WALK IS BEYOND MY STRENGTH
WHEN SHE IS REALLY RECOVERED SHE OUGHT TO TRY CHANGE OF AIR AND COME OVER TO US TELL YOUR FATHER THAT I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS SHARE OF YOUR LETTER AND MOST SINCERELY JOIN IN THE HOPE OF HER BEING EVENTUALLY MUCH THE BETTER
AS SUPERIOR MEDICAL SKILL COULD AFFORD JANE AND HER SISTER CASSANDRA TOOK LODGINGS IN COLLEGE STREET THEY HAD TWO KIND FRIENDS LIVING IN THE CLOSE MISSUS HEATHCOTE AND MISS BIGG THE MOTHER AND AUNT OF THE PRESENT SIR WM HEATHCOTE OF HURSLEY
IN THE WAY OF COURTING THEY WERE VERY PERSISTENT NO DOUBT BUT SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND HER
AND OUR VISIT TO THE SICK ROOM WAS A VERY SHORT ONE AUNT CASSANDRA SOON TAKING US AWAY I DO NOT SUPPOSE WE STAYED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND I NEVER SAW AUNT JANE AGAIN
IN THE ANTE GREENOW DAYS OF HER ADVENTURES BUT THERE WAS THIS DANGER THAT THERE MIGHT BE MORE BEHIND OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER HEARD ANOTHER MISSUS BELLFIELD WAS NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND WHAT
WELL MA'AM YES I AM YOUNG NO DOUBT BUT I WON'T SAY BUT WHAT I'VE HAD A BEAU YOUNG AS I LOOK BUT YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THAT I WANT BEAUX AS YOU CALL THEM I DON'T KNOW MA'AM AS YOU WANTS EM EXACTLY THAT'S AS MAY BE THERE THEY ARE
TO KEEP OFF ANY SERIOUS RETURN OF ILLNESS I AM CONVINCED THAT BILE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL I HAVE SUFFERED
EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN ON THE TWENTY FOURTH OF THAT MONTH SHE WAS BURIED IN WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL NEAR THE CENTRE OF THE NORTH AISLE ALMOST OPPOSITE TO THE BEAUTIFUL CHANTRY TOMB OF WILLIAM OF WYKEHAM
J AUSTEN I CANNOT TELL HOW SOON SHE WAS AWARE OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF HER MALADY BY GOD'S MERCY IT WAS NOT ATTENDED WITH MUCH SUFFERING SO THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO TELL HER FRIENDS AS IN THE FOREGOING LETTER
THE SENSE OF POWER REVIVED AND IMAGINATION RESUMED ITS COURSE SHE CANCELLED THE CONDEMNED CHAPTER AND WROTE TWO OTHERS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IN ITS STEAD
WHAT'S THE WORLD COME TO I WONDER WHEN YOU SIT YOURSELF DOWN THERE AND CROSS EXAMINE YOUR MISTRESS IN THAT WAY GET TO BED WILL YOU IT'S NEAR TEN O'CLOCK I HOPE I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING AMISS MA'AM AND JEANNETTE ROSE FROM HER SEAT
THEN THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE I SUPPOSE MA'AM IT WON'T BE MISTER CHEESACRE TO BE SURE HE'S A MAN AS IS UNCOMMONLY WELL TO DO IN THE WORLD WHAT'S ALL THAT TO ME JEANNETTE I SHALL EVER REGARD MISTER CHEESACRE AS A DEAR FRIEND
SOME OF HER LETTERS WERE OF A GRAVER TONE THAN HAD BEEN CUSTOMARY WITH HER AND EXPRESSED RESIGNATION RATHER THAN CHEERFULNESS IN REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES IN A LETTER TO HER BROTHER CHARLES AFTER MENTIONING THAT SHE HAD BEEN LAID UP WITH AN ATTACK OF BILIOUS FEVER
A THANK FOR EVERY LINE AND AS MANY TO MISTER W DIGWEED FOR COMING WE HAVE BEEN WANTING VERY MUCH TO HEAR OF YOUR MOTHER AND ARE HAPPY TO FIND SHE CONTINUES TO MEND BUT HER ILLNESS MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY SERIOUS ONE INDEED
HE GROWS STILL AND STILL IMPROVES IN APPEARANCE AT LEAST IN THE ESTIMATION OF HIS AUNTS WHO LOVE HIM BETTER AND BETTER AS THEY SEE THE SWEET TEMPER AND WARM AFFECTIONS OF THE BOY CONFIRMED
AND WILLIAM IS TO CALL UPON US SOON GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR E IF EVER YOU ARE ILL MAY YOU BE AS TENDERLY NURSED AS I HAVE BEEN MAY THE SAME BLESSED ALLEVIATIONS OF ANXIOUS SYMPATHISING FRIENDS BE YOURS
IN THE PEACE OF MIND WHICH WAS GRANTED HER IN HER LAST DAYS HER SWEETNESS OF TEMPER NEVER FAILED SHE WAS EVER CONSIDERATE AND GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO ATTENDED ON HER AT TIMES WHEN SHE FELT RATHER BETTER HER PLAYFULNESS OF SPIRIT REVIVED
WE MAY WELL BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE LIVED LONGER BUT SHE WAS ENABLED WITHOUT DISMAY OR COMPLAINT TO PREPARE FOR DEATH SHE WAS A HUMBLE BELIEVING CHRISTIAN HER LIFE HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HOME DUTIES
THOUGH I AM OTHERWISE VERY WELL AND THIS IS NOT A SEASON FOR DONKEY CARRIAGES AND AS WE DO NOT LIKE TO SPARE UNCLE CHARLES HE HAS DECLINED IT TOO TUESDAY AH AH MISTER E
HE WAS VERY FAR FROM FEELING THAT THE BATTLE WAS ALREADY LOST HER LAST WORD TO HIM HAD BEEN AN ASSURANCE OF HER FRIENDSHIP AND THEN WHY SHOULD SHE HAVE BEEN AT SO MUCH TROUBLE TO TELL HIM THE WAY IN WHICH HE OUGHT TO ADDRESS HER IF SHE WERE HERSELF INDIFFERENT AS TO HIS ADDRESSES
JANE AUSTEN IN THE NEXT LETTER WILL BE FOUND HER DESCRIPTION OF HER OWN STYLE OF COMPOSITION WHICH HAS ALREADY APPEARED
WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN HE CRIED WHAT SORT OF A QUESTION IS THIS YOU MAY MEAN IT AS A JOKE BUT YOU NEVER MADE A WORSE ONE NO I DON'T MEAN IT AS A JOKE SAID BURGER SIMPLY
WHICH APPEARED TO BE SLOWLY RIPENING INTO A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO VERY DIFFERENT RIVALS THE BASE AND ORIGIN OF THIS LAY IN THE FACT
TO LOOK AT ANYTHING UPON THE WAY FOR THE PLACE TO WHICH I WILL TAKE YOU CONTAINS ALL THAT YOU CAN SEE AND MORE IT WILL SAVE TIME FOR US TO GO THERE DIRECT
BURGER PUT HIS LANTERN DOWN ON THE GROUND AND SHADED ITS LIGHT IN ALL DIRECTIONS SAVE ONE BY DRAPING HIS OVERCOAT ROUND IT IT MIGHT EXCITE REMARK IF ANYONE SAW A LIGHT IN THIS LONELY PLACE SAID HE JUST HELP ME TO MOVE THIS BOARDING THE FLOORING WAS LOOSE IN THE CORNER
YOU ARE ARDENT IN WORK AS WELL AS IN LOVE SAID THE GERMAN LAUGHING
IS IT FAR SOME MILES NOT TOO FAR TO WALK OH NO WE COULD WALK THERE EASILY WE HAD BETTER DO SO THEN
IN AGE AND IN REPUTATION HE WAS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS HIS ENGLISH COMPANION BUT HIS LIFE AND HIS WORK HAD BOTH BEEN FAR MORE ARDUOUS TWELVE YEARS BEFORE HE HAD COME AS A POOR STUDENT TO ROME
OVER THE CRACKED BROWN WALLS IN EVERY DIRECTION WERE THE BLACK OPENINGS OF PASSAGES WHICH RADIATED FROM THIS COMMON CENTRE I WANT YOU TO FOLLOW ME CLOSELY MY FRIEND SAID BURGER DO NOT LOITER
UPON INSCRIPTIONS FUNERAL VESSELS PICTURES VESTMENTS UTENSILS ALL LYING AS PIOUS HANDS HAD PLACED THEM SO MANY CENTURIES AGO IT WAS APPARENT TO HIM
WOULD YOU GIVE ME AN ANSWER I WONDER THIS NEW CATACOMB IS A VERY INTIMATE THING TO ME AND I SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPECT SOME SIGN OF CONFIDENCE IN RETURN
RUSTY METAL ORNAMENTS WHICH TO THE UNINITIATED MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO HAVE COME STRAIGHT FROM A DUSTMAN'S BIN BUT WHICH A SPECIALIST WOULD HAVE SPEEDILY RECOGNIZED AS UNIQUE OF THEIR KIND THE PILE OF ODDS AND ENDS IN THE FLAT WICKER WORK BASKET
WELL KENNEDY THERE ARE TWO THINGS WHICH I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE VERY FOND OF THE ONE IS AN ADVENTURE AND THE OTHER IS AN OBSTACLE TO SURMOUNT THE ADVENTURE MUST BE THE FINDING OF YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS CATACOMB
AND PLANK BY PLANK THE TWO SAVANTS RAISED IT AND LEANED IT AGAINST THE WALL BELOW THERE WAS A SQUARE APERTURE AND A STAIR OF OLD STONE STEPS WHICH LED AWAY DOWN INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH BE CAREFUL CRIED BURGER
THERE STOOD THE FAMOUS RECONSTRUCTION BY KENNEDY OF THE BATHS OF CARACALLA
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DON'T TELL ME I SHALL MAKE A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH
SO I PRESUME THAT YOU COULD NOT HAVE LOVED HER AT ALL BUT IF YOU DID NOT LOVE HER WHY SHOULD YOU MAKE THIS GREAT SCANDAL WHICH HAS DAMAGED YOU AND RUINED HER
AND I CAN SUPPLY IT MISS SAUNDERSON WAS ENGAGED TO A POOR UNGAINLY DEVIL OF A STUDENT AND HIS NAME WAS JULIUS BURGER THERE WAS A RUSTLE SOMEWHERE THE VAGUE SOUND OF A FOOT STRIKING A STONE
NOW AS REGARDS THIS YOUNG LADY WITH WHOM YOU HAD THIS LITTLE ADVENTURE
THE LANTERN CAST A FLICKERING LIGHT
AND THEN THERE FELL SILENCE UPON THAT OLD CHRISTIAN CHURCH A STAGNANT HEAVY SILENCE WHICH CLOSED ROUND KENNEDY AND SHUT HIM IN LIKE WATER ROUND A DROWNING MAN SOME TWO MONTHS AFTERWARDS
OF THE MATTER BEFORE I EXPOSE MYSELF TO SUCH FORMIDABLE COMPETITION
BUT I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IT HE CONTINUED WHILE BURGER VERY DELIBERATELY LIT A CIGAR IT IS EVIDENTLY A DISCOVERY OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE THESE INSCRIPTIONS WILL MAKE A SENSATION THROUGHOUT EUROPE FOR EVERY ONE
NO DOUBT IT WAS ONE OF THE MEANS OF PROTECTION WHICH THE CHRISTIANS ADOPTED THE ODDS ARE TWO THOUSAND TO ONE AGAINST A MAN GETTING OUT EVEN IF HE HAD A LIGHT BUT IF HE WERE IN THE DARK IT WOULD OF COURSE BE FAR MORE DIFFICULT SO I SHOULD THINK
YOU HAVE GIVEN YOURSELF AWAY BURGER SAID HE AT LAST YOUR WORDS CAN ONLY APPLY TO ONE THING YOU HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW CATACOMB I HAD NO DOUBT THAT YOU HAD ALREADY COME TO THAT CONCLUSION FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THESE OBJECTS WELL
TO PROPERLY APPRECIATE THE OTHER THEIR COMMON INTERESTS AND PURSUITS HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER AND EACH HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE OTHER'S KNOWLEDGE AND THEN GRADUALLY SOMETHING HAD BEEN ADDED TO THIS KENNEDY HAD BEEN AMUSED BY THE FRANKNESS AND SIMPLICITY OF HIS RIVAL
THE COLD CLEAR AIR WAS FILLED WITH THE MUSICAL CHIMES FROM THAT CITY OF CLOCKS AS BURGER WRAPPED IN AN ITALIAN OVERCOAT WITH A LANTERN HANGING FROM HIS HAND WALKED UP TO THE RENDEZVOUS KENNEDY STEPPED OUT OF THE SHADOW TO MEET HIM
AND THIS WAS HEAPED WITH A LITTER OF OBJECTS INSCRIBED TILES BROKEN INSCRIPTIONS CRACKED MOSAICS
THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED CAFES THE RUSHING CARRIAGES AND THE DENSE THRONG UPON THE FOOTPATHS BUT INSIDE IN THE SUMPTUOUS CHAMBER OF THE RICH YOUNG ENGLISH ARCHAEOLOGIST THERE WAS ONLY OLD ROME TO BE SEEN
IF I WAS NOT AWARE OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND OF YOUR ENERGY MY FRIEND I WOULD NOT HESITATE UNDER THE PLEDGE OF SECRECY TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
THE YELLOW LIGHT FLICKERED OVER THE SHRIVELLED FEATURES OF THE MUMMIES AND GLEAMED UPON ROUNDED SKULLS AND LONG WHITE ARMBONES CROSSED OVER FLESHLESS CHESTS AND EVERYWHERE AS HE PASSED KENNEDY LOOKED WITH WISTFUL EYES
THAT I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE HOW YOU SET ABOUT IT FOR EXAMPLE
ON THE TOP OF ALL THE OTHER OBSTACLES WHICH ATTRACTED ME I LEARNED FROM HER OWN LIPS VERY EARLY IN THE PROCEEDINGS THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED
AND YOU MUST PUT IT DOWN TO MY IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD NO DOUBT IT IS QUITE A SIMPLE THING TO PERSUADE A YOUNG LADY TO GO OFF WITH YOU FOR THREE WEEKS OR SO AND THEN TO HAND HER OVER TO HER OWN FAMILY AT WHAT DID YOU CALL THE PLACE TWICKENHAM
ONLY ONE OTHER THING HOW DID YOU GET RID OF HER IN THREE WEEKS
THEY CERTAINLY APPEARED TO INDICATE IT BUT YOUR LAST REMARKS MAKE IT CERTAIN THERE IS NO PLACE EXCEPT A CATACOMB WHICH COULD CONTAIN SO VAST A STORE OF RELICS AS YOU DESCRIBE QUITE SO THERE IS NO MYSTERY ABOUT THAT I HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW CATACOMB
TOO CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN LIMITATIONS IN LARGER SUBJECTS AND IMPATIENT OF THAT SMALL TALK WHICH IS THE CONVENTIONAL REFUGE OF THOSE WHO HAVE NO THOUGHTS TO EXPRESS
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE WORLD AND WOMEN AND SOCIAL LIFE AND THAT SORT OF THING AND SUCH AN INCIDENT HAS THE FASCINATION OF THE UNKNOWN FOR ME I KNOW YOU AND I KNEW HER BY SIGHT
FAITH YOU EXPLAIN YOURSELF AFTER A FASHION SAID HE BUT SINCE IT WAS MORE OR LESS IN YOUR SERVICE THAT I DONNED THE KING'S COAT YOU SHOULD SUFFER IT TO COVER THE THIEF AND PIRATE SHE SHRUGGED AND TURNED ASIDE
NOW CAN'T YE INDEED HE CRIED SURE THEN I'LL BE TELLING YE OH PLEASE THERE WAS REAL ALARM IN HER VOICE I REALIZE FULLY WHAT YOU DID AND I REALIZE THAT PARTLY AT LEAST
WHICH WOULD THUS FORM THE WALLS SIX FEET IN THICKNESS THIS CYLINDER IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS EQUILIBRIUM HAD TO BE BOUND BY IRON BANDS AND FIRMLY FIXED AT CERTAIN INTERVALS BY CROSS CLAMPS FASTENED INTO THE STONE LINING
THAT PRINCE OF TOOLS WAS NEVER INACTIVE FOR ONE MOMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE EXCAVATORS THE GANGS RELIEVED EACH OTHER EVERY THREE HOURS ON THE FOURTH OF NOVEMBER FIFTY WORKMEN COMMENCED DIGGING IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE ENCLOSED SPACE ON THE SUMMIT OF STONES HILL
I CAN REMEMBER KILLING ANOTHER MAN IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE VERY SIMILAR THAT WAS IN BRIDGETOWN ON THE NIGHT OF THE SPANISH RAID MARY TRAILL WOULD TELL YOU OF IT SHE WAS PRESENT
AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE WHOLE TOWN OF HUTS WAS ERECTED ROUND STONES HILL THIS THEY ENCLOSED WITH PALISADES AND IN RESPECT OF ENERGY AND ACTIVITY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES OF THE UNION
AND I SHOULD PREFER ITS BEING DONE PRIVATELY AT THE DISCHARGE OF THE PROJECTILE A FETE IF YOU LIKE TILL THEN NO THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT THE OPERATION INVOLVED UNFORESEEN DANGERS
TWELVE O'CLOCK STRUCK A GUNSHOT SUDDENLY PEALED FORTH AND SHOT ITS FLAME INTO THE AIR TWELVE HUNDRED MELTING TROUGHS WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY OPENED AND TWELVE HUNDRED FIERY SERPENTS CREPT TOWARD THE CENTRAL WELL
SO IT'S HEIGH HO AND HEAVE A HO WHO'LL SAIL FOR THE MAIN WITH ME BLOOD FETCHED A SIGH AND THE GHOST OF A SMILE PLAYED OVER HIS LEAN SUN TANNED FACE
DID YOU NOT MURDER LEVASSEUR LEVASSEUR HE SMILED A LITTLE SO THEY'VE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT DO YOU DENY IT I KILLED HIM IT IS TRUE
AND IF HIS THIN LIPS SMILED HIS BLUE EYES WERE ODDLY HARD SINCE YOU PERCEIVE IT SIR I WONDER THAT YOU TROUBLE TO BE SO INSISTENT THAT CROSSED THE SWORDS BETWEEN THEM
WERE THE FLAT FRONTED WHITE BUILDINGS OF THAT IMPOSING CITY THAT CAME DOWN TO THE VERY WATER'S EDGE BEHIND THESE THE RED ROOFS ROSE LIKE TERRACES MARKING THE GENTLE SLOPE UPON WHICH THE CITY WAS BUILT DOMINATED HERE BY A TURRET
WHILE THESE MOLTEN WAVES LAUNCHING INTO THE SKY THEIR WREATHS OF SMOKE EVAPORATED THE MOISTURE OF THE MOULD AND HURLED IT UPWARD THROUGH THE VENT HOLES OF THE STONE LINING IN THE FORM OF DENSE VAPOR CLOUDS
I ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I WAS FULLY INFORMED OF ALL I DO NOT GRANT THE KING'S COMMISSION LIGHTLY DON'T YOU BY GOD
IN SOME RESENTMENT AND SOME REGRET FEARING TO BETRAY THE LATTER SHE TOOK REFUGE IN THE FORMER I DO MY BEST SAID SHE SO THAT YE CAN BE CHARITABLE IN SOME WAYS HE LAUGHED SOFTLY
THEY HAVE IN FACT MORE REGARD FOR HUMAN NATURE IN GENERAL THAN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL IN PARTICULAR NEVERTHELESS BARBICANE PROFESSED OPPOSITE PRINCIPLES TO THESE AND PUT THEM IN FORCE AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY SO
A QUANTITY FAR TOO COSTLY TO SEND BY RAILWAY THE COST OF TRANSPORT WOULD HAVE BEEN DOUBLE THAT OF MATERIAL IT APPEARED PREFERABLE TO FREIGHT VESSELS AT NEW YORK AND TO LOAD THEM WITH THE IRON IN BARS
YOU TAKE THAT TONE YOU DARE TO TAKE THAT TONE SHE CRIED ASTOUNDING HIM BY HER SUDDEN VEHEMENCE YOU HAVE THE EFFRONTERY TO UPBRAID ME BECAUSE I WILL NOT TAKE YOUR HANDS
PERCHED ON A NEIGHBORING EMINENCE ASSISTED AT THE OPERATION IN FRONT OF THEM WAS A PIECE OF ARTILLERY READY TO GIVE FIRE ON THE SIGNAL FROM THE ENGINEER SOME MINUTES BEFORE MIDDAY THE FIRST DRIBLETS OF METAL BEGAN TO FLOW
PITT LOOSELY CLAD IN SHIRT AND BREECHES LEANED AGAINST THE RAIL THE WHILE AND WATCHED HIM UNMISTAKABLE CONCERN IMPRINTED ON HIS FAIR FRANK COUNTENANCE
ATTRACTED BY THE HIGH PAY AND CONSIDERABLE BOUNTIES OFFERED BY THE GUN CLUB HE HAD ENLISTED A CHOICE LEGION OF STOKERS IRON FOUNDERS LIME BURNERS MINERS BRICKMAKERS AND ARTISANS OF EVERY TRADE WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF COLOR
AND THE WORKS WERE COMMENCED IN MOST PERFECT ORDER THE NATURE OF THE SOIL HAVING BEEN CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY MEANS OF REPEATED BORINGS THE WORK OF EXCAVATION WAS FIXED FOR THE FOURTH OF NOVEMBER
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NEITHER ANY ERUPTION NOR TYPHOON NOR STORM NOR STRUGGLE OF THE ELEMENTS NOR ANY OF THOSE TERRIBLE PHENOMENA WHICH NATURE IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING NO IT WAS MAN ALONE WHO HAD PRODUCED THESE REDDISH VAPORS
THE WHEEL PARTLY GAVE WAY AND A SLIGHT PARTIAL SETTLEMENT ENSUED THIS ACCIDENT COST THE LIFE OF SEVERAL WORKMEN NO FRESH OCCURRENCE THENCEFORWARD ARRESTED THE PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION
DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND SAID LORD JULIAN DISTANTLY TO BE SURE YOU DON'T
AND HIS VENOM WAS PLAIN TO ALL FROM THAT UNPROMISING BEGINNING MATTERS HAD NOT IMPROVED
ALL IN WHITE AND VERY MAIDENLY SAVE IN HER UNNATURAL COMPOSURE I AM PRESSED SHE INFORMED HIM SO YOU WILL FORGIVE ME IF I DO NOT STAY YOU WERE NONE SO PRESSED UNTIL I CAME HE PROTESTED
BARBICANE'S UNEASINESS INCREASED AS HE SAW HIS PROJECTILE RESIST THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITATION THE UNKNOWN WAS OPENING BEFORE HIM THE UNKNOWN IN INTERPLANETARY SPACE THE MAN OF SCIENCE THOUGHT HE HAD FORESEEN THE ONLY THREE HYPOTHESES POSSIBLE
AT LAST AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR SOME HOURS HE SAW A CLUMP OF TREES IN THE DISTANCE AND THROUGH THE TREES HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE GLIMMER OF A SINGLE RAY OF LIGHT HE EXCLAIMED WITH JOY OH
THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY'S NOTE SAYS THAT THE TRANSIT OUGHT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN NINETY SEVEN HOURS THIRTEEN MINUTES AND TWENTY SECONDS WHICH MEANS TO SAY THAT SOONER THE MOON WILL NOT BE AT THE POINT INDICATED AND LATER IT WILL HAVE PASSED IT TRUE
AND THEY MIGHT HOPE THAT AT A NEARER POINT THE WEIGHT PREDOMINATING WOULD CAUSE A DECIDED FALL THE THREE FRIENDS HAVING NOTHING BETTER TO DO CONTINUED THEIR OBSERVATIONS BUT THEY COULD NOT YET DETERMINE THE TOPOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF THE SATELLITE
CRIED NICHOLL AND AS IF A LIGHT HAD SUDDENLY BROKEN IN UPON HIS MIND BARBICANE ANSWERED
OR TO CRAVE FOR FORGIVENESS OF SINS HE HAD APPARENTLY LOST HIS WAY AND AS IT WAS LATE HE MET NO ONE WHO COULD SHOW HIM THE ROAD OR WARN HIM OF THE HAUNTED SPOT HE HAD WALKED THE WHOLE DAY AND WAS NOW TIRED AND HUNGRY
THE PILGRIM CALLED TO HER ACROSS THE BAMBOO FENCE AND SAID O BAA SAN OLD WOMAN GOOD EVENING I AM A TRAVELER PLEASE EXCUSE ME BUT I HAVE LOST MY WAY AND DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
AND THEY TALKED TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME THE PILGRIM THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY LUCKY TO COME ACROSS SUCH A KIND HOSPITABLE OLD WOMAN AT LAST THE WOOD GAVE OUT AND AS THE FIRE DIED SLOWLY DOWN HE BEGAN TO SHIVER WITH COLD
MICHEL REPLIED THAT HE WOULD BREAK THEIR FALL BY MEANS OF ROCKETS PROPERLY PLACED THUS POWERFUL FIREWORKS TAKING THEIR STARTING POINT FROM THE BASE AND BURSTING OUTSIDE COULD BY PRODUCING A RECOIL CHECK TO A CERTAIN DEGREE THE PROJECTILE'S SPEED
AND AT LAST HE RECOGNIZED THE OLD WOMAN'S VOICE WHICH GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER AS SHE CAME NEARER STOP STOP YOU WICKED MAN WHY DID YOU LOOK INTO THE FORBIDDEN ROOM THE PRIEST QUITE FORGOT HOW TIRED HE WAS
THE RETURN TO THE EARTH THE RETURN TO THE MOON OR STAGNATION ON THE NEUTRAL LINE AND HERE A FOURTH HYPOTHESIS BIG WITH ALL THE TERRORS OF THE INFINITE SURGED UP INOPPORTUNELY TO FACE IT WITHOUT FLINCHING
WHICH WAS ONLY TWO THOUSAND LEAGUES DISTANT THAT ITS SPEED WAS BECOMING UNIFORM FRESH PROOF THAT THERE WAS NO FALL ITS IMPULSIVE FORCE STILL PREVAILED OVER THE LUNAR ATTRACTION BUT THE PROJECTILE'S COURSE WAS CERTAINLY BRINGING IT NEARER TO THE MOON
AND THE MOON PASSING TO THE ZENITH OF THE SPOT WE OUGHT TO REACH IT AT THE FULL THERE IS ANOTHER REASON BUT IT ESCAPES ME ARE WE NOT ARRIVING TOO LATE ASKED NICHOLL TOO LATE SAID BARBICANE YES CONTINUED NICHOLL
THEY HAD THEN NOTHING TO DO BUT RAISE THE METALLIC BUFFERS FIXED IN THE BASE AND REPLACE THEM BY THE GUNS WHICH FITTED CLOSELY IN THEIR PLACES THIS NEW WORK WAS FINISHED ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK AND AFTER TAKING ALL THESE PRECAUTIONS THERE REMAINED BUT TO WAIT
AND SHE STILL SHRIEKED AFTER HIM STOP STOP AT LAST WHEN THE PRIEST FELT HE COULD RUN NO MORE THE DAWN BROKE AND WITH THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT THE GOBLIN VANISHED AND HE WAS SAFE
FROM THESE CONFLICTING INFLUENCES RESULTED A LINE WHICH MIGHT BECOME A TANGENT BUT IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THE PROJECTILE WOULD NOT FALL DIRECTLY ON THE MOON FOR ITS LOWER PART BY REASON OF ITS WEIGHT OUGHT TO BE TURNED TOWARD HER
EVERY PIECE EASY TO HANDLE AS THEIR WEIGHT WAS NOW SCARCELY FELT WAS QUICKLY MOUNTED THE DIFFERENT PIECES WERE FITTED WITHOUT TROUBLE IT BEING ONLY A MATTER OF BOLTS AND SCREWS
YOU MUST STAY QUIETLY HERE FOR YOU ARE MY GUEST THEN SHE LEFT HIM AND WENT OUT IN A MINUTE SHE CAME BACK AND SAID
THEY WOULD HAVE ASKED THEMSELVES WHITHER THEIR PROJECTILE CARRIAGE WAS CARRYING THEM NOT SO WITH THESE THEY SOUGHT FOR THE CAUSE WHICH PRODUCED THIS EFFECT SO WE HAVE BECOME DIVERTED FROM OUR ROUTE SAID MICHEL BUT WHY
IT IS NOW HALF PAST THREE IN THE EVENING HALF PAST EIGHT OUGHT TO SEE US AT THE END OF OUR JOURNEY WHY DO WE NOT ARRIVE MIGHT IT NOT BE AN EXCESS OF SPEED ANSWERED NICHOLL FOR WE KNOW NOW THAT ITS INITIAL VELOCITY WAS GREATER THAN THEY SUPPOSED
RETORTED MICHEL ARDAN WE SHALL ARRIVE AND THAT TOO QUICKER THAN WE LIKE THIS ANSWER BROUGHT BARBICANE BACK TO HIS PREPARATIONS AND HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH PLACING THE CONTRIVANCES INTENDED TO BREAK THEIR DESCENT
BUT HE WANTED TO KNOW AT ANY COST WHY HIS PROJECTILE HAD DEVIATED BUT THE PROJECTILE CONTINUED ITS COURSE SIDEWAYS TO THE MOON AND WITH IT THE MASS OF THINGS THROWN OUT BARBICANE COULD EVEN PROVE BY THE ELEVATIONS WHICH SERVED AS LANDMARKS UPON THE MOON

AND QUICKEN MY SYMPATHIES FOR MY BRETHREN IN BONDS IF ANY ONE WISHES TO BE IMPRESSED WITH THE SOUL KILLING EFFECTS OF SLAVERY LET HIM GO TO COLONEL LLOYD'S PLANTATION AND ON ALLOWANCE DAY
NO AGE NOR SEX FINDS ANY FAVOR MISTER SEVERE THE OVERSEER USED TO STAND BY THE DOOR OF THE QUARTER ARMED WITH A LARGE HICKORY STICK AND HEAVY COWSKIN READY TO WHIP ANY ONE WHO WAS SO UNFORTUNATE AS NOT TO HEAR
THANKS TO A KIND PROVIDENCE I FELL TO THE PORTION OF MISSUS LUCRETIA AND WAS SENT IMMEDIATELY BACK TO BALTIMORE TO LIVE AGAIN IN THE FAMILY OF MASTER HUGH
THAT ONE GREAT STATESMAN OF THE SOUTH PREDICTED THE DOWNFALL OF SLAVERY BY THE INEVITABLE LAWS OF POPULATION
AND A WHIPPING IS THE PENALTY OF NOT BEING IN THE FIELD AT SUNRISE UNLESS A SLAVE HAS SPECIAL PERMISSION FROM HIS OR HER MASTER TO THE CONTRARY A PERMISSION WHICH THEY SELDOM GET AND ONE THAT GIVES TO HIM THAT GIVES IT THE PROUD NAME OF BEING A KIND MASTER
BUT I WELL REMEMBER IT I NEVER SHALL FORGET IT WHILST I REMEMBER ANY THING IT WAS THE FIRST OF A LONG SERIES OF SUCH OUTRAGES
HARDENED BY A LONG LIFE OF SLAVEHOLDING HE WOULD AT TIMES SEEM TO TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN WHIPPING A SLAVE I HAVE OFTEN BEEN AWAKENED AT THE DAWN OF DAY BY THE MOST HEART RENDING SHRIEKS OF AN OWN AUNT OF MINE
MISTER SEVERE'S PLACE WAS FILLED BY A MISTER HOPKINS HE WAS A VERY DIFFERENT MAN HE WAS LESS CRUEL LESS PROFANE AND MADE LESS NOISE THAN MISTER SEVERE HIS COURSE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY NO EXTRAORDINARY DEMONSTRATIONS OF CRUELTY
THE BARRIER BETWIXT HIMSELF AND BROTHER HE CONSIDERED IMPASSABLE I THEN HAD TO REGRET THAT I DID NOT AT LEAST MAKE THE ATTEMPT TO CARRY OUT MY RESOLUTION TO RUN AWAY FOR THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE TENFOLD GREATER FROM THE CITY
RECEIVED ADVICE AND DIRECTION FROM THE MANAGERS OF THE HOME PLANTATION THIS WAS THE GREAT BUSINESS PLACE IT WAS THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT FOR THE WHOLE TWENTY FARMS ALL DISPUTES AMONG THE OVERSEERS WERE SETTLED HERE IF A SLAVE WAS CONVICTED OF ANY HIGH MISDEMEANOR BECAME UNMANAGEABLE
CHAPTER EIGHT IN A VERY SHORT TIME AFTER I WENT TO LIVE AT BALTIMORE MY OLD MASTER'S YOUNGEST SON RICHARD DIED AND IN ABOUT THREE YEARS AND SIX MONTHS AFTER HIS DEATH MY OLD MASTER CAPTAIN ANTHONY DIED
I CAN NEVER GET RID OF THAT CONCEPTION
WITHOUT MIGHT SEE AND HEAR THEY TOLD A TALE OF WOE WHICH WAS THEN ALTOGETHER BEYOND MY FEEBLE COMPREHENSION THEY WERE TONES LOUD LONG AND DEEP THEY BREATHED THE PRAYER AND COMPLAINT OF SOULS BOILING OVER WITH THE BITTEREST ANGUISH
ONE DAUGHTER LUCRETIA AND HER HUSBAND CAPTAIN THOMAS AULD THEY LIVED IN ONE HOUSE UPON THE HOME PLANTATION OF COLONEL EDWARD LLOYD MY MASTER WAS COLONEL LLOYD'S CLERK AND SUPERINTENDENT
IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO HAVE A VALUATION OF THE PROPERTY THAT IT MIGHT BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN MISSUS LUCRETIA AND MASTER ANDREW I WAS IMMEDIATELY SENT FOR TO BE VALUED WITH THE OTHER PROPERTY
IT WAS THEIR BASE INGRATITUDE TO MY POOR OLD GRANDMOTHER
THE WHITE CHILDREN COULD TELL THEIR AGES I COULD NOT TELL WHY I OUGHT TO BE DEPRIVED OF THE SAME PRIVILEGE I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY INQUIRIES OF MY MASTER CONCERNING IT HE DEEMED ALL SUCH INQUIRIES ON THE PART OF A SLAVE IMPROPER AND IMPERTINENT
AND HER PRESENT OWNERS FINDING SHE WAS OF BUT LITTLE VALUE HER FRAME ALREADY RACKED WITH THE PAINS OF OLD AGE AND COMPLETE HELPLESSNESS FAST STEALING OVER HER ONCE ACTIVE LIMBS THEY TOOK HER TO THE WOODS BUILT HER A LITTLE HUT PUT UP A LITTLE MUD CHIMNEY
LEAVING ONLY HIS SON ANDREW AND DAUGHTER LUCRETIA TO SHARE HIS ESTATE HE DIED WHILE ON A VISIT TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER AT HILLSBOROUGH CUT OFF THUS UNEXPECTEDLY HE LEFT NO WILL AS TO THE DISPOSAL OF HIS PROPERTY
IT WAS A GLAD DAY TO ME
CALLED THUS SUDDENLY AWAY SHE LEFT ME WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST INTIMATION OF WHO MY FATHER WAS THE WHISPER THAT MY MASTER WAS MY FATHER MAY OR MAY NOT BE TRUE
I HAVE NO LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS THE HIGH EXCITEMENT AND DEEP ANXIETY WHICH WERE FELT AMONG US POOR SLAVES DURING THIS TIME OUR FATE FOR LIFE WAS NOW TO BE DECIDED WE HAD NO MORE VOICE IN THAT DECISION THAN THE BRUTES AMONG WHOM WE WERE RANKED
FOR DURING THIS INTERVAL A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE IN MASTER HUGH AND HIS ONCE KIND AND AFFECTIONATE WIFE THE INFLUENCE OF BRANDY UPON HIM AND OF SLAVERY UPON HER HAD EFFECTED A DISASTROUS CHANGE IN THE CHARACTERS OF BOTH
THE SONGS OF THE SLAVE REPRESENT THE SORROWS OF HIS HEART AND HE IS RELIEVED BY THEM ONLY AS AN ACHING HEART IS RELIEVED BY ITS TEARS AT LEAST SUCH IS MY EXPERIENCE I HAVE OFTEN SUNG TO DROWN MY SORROW BUT SELDOM TO EXPRESS MY HAPPINESS
AND IN THEIR HANDS SHE SAW HER CHILDREN HER GRANDCHILDREN AND HER GREAT GRANDCHILDREN DIVIDED LIKE SO MANY SHEEP WITHOUT BEING GRATIFIED WITH THE SMALL PRIVILEGE OF A SINGLE WORD AS TO THEIR OR HER OWN DESTINY
THEY REGARDED IT AS EVIDENCE OF GREAT CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN THEM BY THEIR OVERSEERS AND IT WAS ON THIS ACCOUNT AS WELL AS A CONSTANT DESIRE TO BE OUT OF THE FIELD FROM UNDER THE DRIVER'S LASH THAT THEY ESTEEMED IT A HIGH PRIVILEGE ONE WORTH CAREFUL LIVING FOR
WOULD BE OUR INEVITABLE CONDITION A CONDITION HELD BY US ALL IN THE UTMOST HORROR AND DREAD I SUFFERED MORE ANXIETY THAN MOST OF MY FELLOW SLAVES I HAD KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO BE KINDLY TREATED THEY HAD KNOWN NOTHING OF THE KIND
THEY HAD SEEN LITTLE OR NOTHING OF THE WORLD THEY WERE IN VERY DEED MEN AND WOMEN OF SORROW AND ACQUAINTED WITH GRIEF THEIR BACKS HAD BEEN MADE FAMILIAR WITH THE BLOODY LASH SO THAT THEY HAD BECOME CALLOUS MINE WAS YET TENDER
HE DIED VERY SOON AFTER I WENT TO COLONEL LLOYD'S AND HE DIED AS HE LIVED UTTERING WITH HIS DYING GROANS BITTER CURSES AND HORRID OATHS HIS DEATH WAS REGARDED BY THE SLAVES AS THE RESULT OF A MERCIFUL PROVIDENCE
THEY SELDOM COME NEARER TO IT THAN PLANTING TIME HARVEST TIME CHERRY TIME SPRING TIME OR FALL TIME A WANT OF INFORMATION CONCERNING MY OWN WAS A SOURCE OF UNHAPPINESS TO ME EVEN DURING CHILDHOOD
THE NECESSITY OF ANY ACTION WHETHER OF MATTER OR OF MIND IS NOT PROPERLY SPEAKING A QUALITY IN THE AGENT BUT IN ANY THINKING OR INTELLIGENT BEING WHO MAY CONSIDER THE ACTION AND IT CONSISTS CHIEFLY IN THE DETERMINATION
IN SHORT THIS EXPERIMENTAL INFERENCE AND REASONING CONCERNING THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS ENTERS SO MUCH INTO HUMAN LIFE THAT NO MAN WHILE AWAKE IS EVER A MOMENT WITHOUT EMPLOYING IT
THAT ONE OBJECT OR EVENT HAS FOLLOWED ANOTHER NOT THAT ONE WAS PRODUCED BY THE OTHER THE RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT MUST BE UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO MANKIND INFERENCE AND REASONING CONCERNING THE OPERATIONS OF NATURE WOULD FROM THAT MOMENT
AND OTHER EXTERNAL OBJECTS BY THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH HE FORMS CONCERNING THEM NOR ARE THE EARTH WATER AND OTHER ELEMENTS EXAMINED BY ARISTOTLE AND HIPPOCRATES MORE LIKE TO THOSE WHICH AT PRESENT LIE UNDER OUR OBSERVATION THAN THE MEN DESCRIBED BY POLYBIUS AND TACITUS
AND IF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BE ALSO UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO TAKE PLACE IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE MIND THE DISPUTE IS AT AN END AT LEAST MUST BE OWNED TO BE THENCEFORTH MERELY VERBAL
WHEN THE USUAL SYMPTOMS OF HEALTH OR SICKNESS DISAPPOINT OUR EXPECTATION WHEN MEDICINES OPERATE NOT WITH THEIR WONTED POWERS WHEN IRREGULAR EVENTS FOLLOW FROM ANY PARTICULAR CAUSE
GENEROSITY PUBLIC SPIRIT THESE PASSIONS MIXED IN VARIOUS DEGREES AND DISTRIBUTED THROUGH SOCIETY HAVE BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD AND STILL ARE THE SOURCE OF ALL THE ACTIONS AND ENTERPRISES WHICH HAVE EVER BEEN OBSERVED
HERE IS A CONNECTED CHAIN OF NATURAL CAUSES AND VOLUNTARY ACTIONS BUT THE MIND FEELS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IN PASSING FROM ONE LINK TO ANOTHER NOR IS LESS CERTAIN OF THE FUTURE EVENT THAN IF IT WERE CONNECTED WITH THE OBJECTS PRESENT TO THE MEMORY OR SENSES BY A TRAIN OF CAUSES
IN ALL ITS OPERATIONS IS ACTUATED BY A NECESSARY FORCE AND THAT EVERY NATURAL EFFECT IS SO PRECISELY DETERMINED BY THE ENERGY OF ITS CAUSE THAT NO OTHER EFFECT IN SUCH PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD POSSIBLY HAVE RESULTED FROM IT
MIRACLES AND PRODIGIES AND IF WE WOULD EXPLODE ANY FORGERY IN HISTORY WE CANNOT MAKE USE OF A MORE CONVINCING ARGUMENT THAN TO PROVE THAT THE ACTIONS ASCRIBED TO ANY PERSON ARE DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO THE COURSE OF NATURE AND THAT NO HUMAN MOTIVES IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
IT IS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED THAT NOTHING EXISTS WITHOUT A CAUSE OF ITS EXISTENCE AND THAT CHANCE WHEN STRICTLY EXAMINED IS A MERE NEGATIVE WORD AND MEANS NOT ANY REAL POWER WHICH HAS ANYWHERE A BEING IN NATURE
A NECESSARY CONNEXION WITH ITS EFFECT AND LET HIM SHOW DISTINCTLY THE ORIGIN OF THE IDEA EXPRESSED BY THE DEFINITION AND I SHALL READILY GIVE UP THE WHOLE CONTROVERSY BUT IF THE FOREGOING EXPLICATION OF THE MATTER BE RECEIVED
BUT THOUGH THIS CONCLUSION CONCERNING HUMAN IGNORANCE BE THE RESULT OF THE STRICTEST SCRUTINY OF THIS SUBJECT
IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE WINDS RAIN CLOUDS AND OTHER VARIATIONS OF THE WEATHER ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GOVERNED BY STEADY PRINCIPLES THOUGH NOT EASILY DISCOVERABLE BY HUMAN SAGACITY
BOTH OF NECESSITY AND OF LIBERTY ACCORDING TO ANY REASONABLE SENSE WHICH CAN BE PUT ON THESE TERMS AND THAT THE WHOLE CONTROVERSY HAS HITHERTO TURNED MERELY UPON WORDS
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE THE REASON WHY ALL MANKIND THOUGH THEY HAVE EVER WITHOUT HESITATION ACKNOWLEDGED THE DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY IN THEIR WHOLE PRACTICE AND REASONING HAVE YET DISCOVERED SUCH A RELUCTANCE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT IN WORDS AND HAVE RATHER SHOWN A PROPENSITY
BY SHOWING MEN IN ALL VARIETIES OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND SITUATIONS AND FURNISHING US WITH MATERIALS FROM WHICH WE MAY FORM OUR OBSERVATIONS AND BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE REGULAR SPRINGS OF HUMAN ACTION AND BEHAVIOUR THESE RECORDS OF WARS INTRIGUES
IN SEARCH OF ARGUMENTS WHICH MAY GIVE THEM THE VICTORY OVER THEIR ANTAGONISTS IT IS TRUE IF MEN ATTEMPT THE DISCUSSION OF QUESTIONS WHICH LIE ENTIRELY BEYOND THE REACH OF HUMAN CAPACITY
IF WE COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE CONDUCT AND SENTIMENTS OF HIS ACTORS EITHER NATURAL OR UNNATURAL TO SUCH CHARACTERS AND IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
AMONG MANKIND WOULD YOU KNOW THE SENTIMENTS INCLINATIONS AND COURSE OF LIFE OF THE GREEKS AND ROMANS STUDY WELL THE TEMPER AND ACTIONS OF THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH YOU CANNOT BE MUCH MISTAKEN IN TRANSFERRING TO THE FORMER MOST OF THE OBSERVATIONS
BUT IT IS PRETENDED THAT SOME CAUSES ARE NECESSARY SOME NOT NECESSARY HERE THEN IS THE ADVANTAGE OF DEFINITIONS LET ANY ONE DEFINE A CAUSE WITHOUT COMPREHENDING AS A PART OF THE DEFINITION
OR COMMON LIFE NOW AS IT IS FROM PAST EXPERIENCE THAT WE DRAW ALL INFERENCES CONCERNING THE FUTURE AND AS WE CONCLUDE THAT OBJECTS WILL ALWAYS BE CONJOINED TOGETHER WHICH WE FIND TO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONJOINED IT MAY SEEM SUPERFLUOUS TO PROVE THAT THIS EXPERIENCED UNIFORMITY IN HUMAN ACTIONS
PHILOSOPHERS FORM A MAXIM THAT THE CONNEXION BETWEEN ALL CAUSES AND EFFECTS IS EQUALLY NECESSARY AND THAT ITS SEEMING UNCERTAINTY IN SOME INSTANCES PROCEEDS FROM THE SECRET OPPOSITION OF CONTRARY CAUSES THUS FOR INSTANCE IN THE HUMAN BODY
NEVER CHANGE WERE A MAN WHOM I KNOW TO BE HONEST AND OPULENT AND WITH WHOM I LIVE IN INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP
YET IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT IN PERFORMING THE ACTIONS THEMSELVES WE ARE SENSIBLE OF SOMETHING LIKE IT AND AS ALL RESEMBLING OBJECTS ARE READILY TAKEN FOR EACH OTHER THIS HAS BEEN EMPLOYED AS A DEMONSTRATIVE AND EVEN INTUITIVE PROOF OF HUMAN LIBERTY
WE SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE TERMS FOR THIS IS INDEED ALL WE KNOW OF THE MATTER
IT MUST OFTEN APPEAR VERY UNCERTAIN IN ITS OPERATIONS AND THAT THEREFORE THE IRREGULAR EVENTS WHICH OUTWARDLY DISCOVER THEMSELVES CAN BE NO PROOF THAT THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE NOT OBSERVED WITH THE GREATEST REGULARITY
FOR AS THE FACULTIES OF THE MIND ARE SUPPOSED TO BE NATURALLY ALIKE IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL OTHERWISE NOTHING COULD BE MORE FRUITLESS THAN TO REASON OR DISPUTE TOGETHER IT WERE IMPOSSIBLE
CEMENTED TOGETHER BY WHAT WE ARE PLEASED TO CALL A PHYSICAL NECESSITY THE SAME EXPERIENCED UNION HAS THE SAME EFFECT ON THE MIND WHETHER THE UNITED OBJECTS BE MOTIVES VOLITION AND ACTIONS OR FIGURE AND MOTION WE MAY CHANGE THE NAME OF THINGS
IF SHE HAD DECOYED HER BROTHER HOME TO BLOT OUT THE MEMORY OF HIS ERROR BY HIS BLOOD SHE SAW HER FATHER'S ANXIETY LAY DEEPER THAN THE SOURCE OF HIS LATTER CHEERING WORDS
BUT THE WRANGLIN AND THE LOUD VOICES HAD JUST TORN ME TO PIECES AND I THOUGHT WHEN FATHER LEFT OH IF I COULD JUST HEAR HER VOICE READING ME SOME WORDS O PEACE AND PROMISE I COULD DIE AWAY INTO THE SILENCE AND REST O GOD
MARGARET DID NOT THINK OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE UTTERLY UNREASONABLE IN THIS SPEECH WE DO NOT LOOK FOR REASON OR LOGIC IN THE PASSIONATE ENTREATIES OF THOSE WHO ARE SICK UNTO DEATH
BUT ALL WAS PROFOUNDLY HUSHED IN THE NOONDAY STILLNESS OF A HOUSE WHERE AN INVALID CATCHES THE UNREFRESHING SLEEP THAT IS DENIED TO THE NIGHT HOURS
AND IT SHALL GO BY THIS VERY POST AND IF PAPA THINKS FIT HE CAN WRITE AGAIN WHEN HE COMES IN IT IS ONLY A DAY'S DELAY OH MAMMA DON'T CRY SO PITIFULLY IT CUTS ME TO THE HEART
THEIR INTERCOURSE HAD BEEN ONE CONTINUED SERIES OF OPPOSITION THEIR OPINIONS CLASHED AND INDEED SHE HAD NEVER PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD CARED FOR HER OPINIONS AS BELONGING TO HER THE INDIVIDUAL
IT'S THAT THAT'S FRETTING ME
HOW DARED HE SAY THAT HE WOULD LOVE HER STILL EVEN THOUGH SHE SHOOK HIM OFF WITH CONTEMPT SHE WISHED SHE HAD SPOKEN MORE STRONGER SHARP DECISIVE SPEECHES CAME THRONGING INTO HER MIND
I ONLY WENT TO OXENHAM ONCE AFTER I WAS MARRIED TO YOUR AUNT SHAW'S WEDDING AND POOR LITTLE FRED WAS THE BABY THEN
AND THE INSTANT AFTERWARDS TO REGRET IT NEARLY AS MUCH AS SHE DID ALTHOUGH FOR DIFFERENT REASONS IN MISTER THORNTON'S CASE AS FAR AS MARGARET KNEW THERE WAS NO INTERVENING STAGE OF FRIENDSHIP
AND NOW HE HAD COME IN THIS STRANGE WILD PASSIONATE WAY TO MAKE KNOWN HIS LOVE FOR ALTHOUGH AT FIRST IT HAD STRUCK HER THAT HIS OFFER WAS FORCED AND GOADED OUT OF HIM BY SHARP COMPASSION
HE DID NA SPEAK WORDS HE WERE ALL IN SUCH A TREMBLE WI SPENT PASSION I COULD NA BEAR TO LOOK AT HIM I HEARD HIS BREATH COMING QUICK AND AT ONE TIME I THOUGHT HE WERE SOBBING
SHALL I READ YOU A CHAPTER NOW AY DO
AND IS IN GOOD CONDITION HE AND I'LL HAVE AN UP AND DOWN FIGHT PURRING AN A AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FOR HIM AND SO FATHER SHOOK ME OFF FOR INDEED I WAS LOW AND FAINT ENOUGH
AND INDEED MARGARET THE LONGING TO SEE FREDERICK STANDS BETWEEN ME AND GOD I CANNOT PRAY TILL I HAVE THIS ONE THING INDEED I CANNOT DON'T LOSE TIME DEAR DEAR MARGARET
IT IS THERE THERE COWERING AND GIBBERING WITH FIXED GHASTLY EYES IN SOME CORNER OF THE CHAMBER LISTENING TO HEAR WHETHER WE DARE TO BREATHE OF ITS PRESENCE TO ANY ONE AND WE DARE NOT
AND MARGARET IF I AM TO DIE IF I AM ONE OF THOSE APPOINTED TO DIE BEFORE MANY WEEKS ARE OVER I MUST SEE MY CHILD FIRST I CANNOT THINK HOW IT MUST BE MANAGED
AND WHAT WITH MY BEING A GREAT DEAL WITH ANNA JUST BEFORE HER MARRIAGE AND NOT BEING VERY STRONG MYSELF DIXON HAD MORE OF THE CHARGE OF HIM THAN SHE EVER HAD BEFORE AND IT MADE HER SO FOND OF HIM
IT WAS THOSE BEDS AT SIR JOHN'S NOW MARGARET YOU'RE YOUNG ENOUGH AND GO ABOUT IN THE DAY ARE THE BEDS COMFORTABLE I APPEAL TO YOU DO THEY GIVE YOU A FEELING OF PERFECT REPOSE WHEN YOU LIE DOWN UPON THEM
HE SAT DOWN A BIT AND PUT HIS HAND AFORE HIS EYES
MISSUS HALE COULD NOT STOP HER TEARS THEY CAME HYSTERICALLY AND IN TRUTH SHE MADE NO EFFORT TO CONTROL THEM BUT RATHER CALLED UP ALL THE PICTURES OF THE HAPPY PAST AND THE PROBABLE FUTURE
MARGARET READ IN HER SOFT LOW VOICE THOUGH BESSY'S EYES WERE SHUT SHE WAS LISTENING FOR SOME TIME FOR THE MOISTURE OF TEARS GATHERED HEAVY ON HER EYELASHES
JUST AS BRAVELY IN SPITE OF HIS DEDUCTIONS AND THE COLD SLIME OF WOMEN'S IMPERTINENCE SHE DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS RIGHT AND SIMPLE AND TRUE TO SAVE WHERE SHE COULD SAVE EVEN TO TRY TO SAVE
I'M SO SLEEPY AT NIGHT THAT IF I ONLY LIE DOWN ANYWHERE I NAP OFF DIRECTLY SO I DON'T THINK I'M A COMPETENT WITNESS BUT THEN YOU KNOW I NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING SIR JOHN BERESFORD'S BEDS I NEVER WAS AT OXENHAM
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE WERE CONVULSED INTO DOUBLE RESTLESSNESS THE NEXT AT LAST SHE BURST OUT DON'T GO ON READING IT'S NO USE I'M BLASPHEMING ALL THE TIME IN MY MIND WI THINKING ANGRILY ON WHAT CANNA BE HELPED
SO RIGHT TO BOTH PARTIES THAT MARGARET FELT AS IF ON FREDERICK'S ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ON HER MOTHER'S SHE OUGHT TO OVERLOOK ALL INTERMEDIATE CHANCES OF DANGER AND PLEDGE HERSELF TO DO EVERYTHING IN HER POWER FOR ITS REALISATION
YOUR FATHER WAS NOT THERE WAS HE SAID MARGARET COLOURING DEEP NOT HE
AND I KNOW DIXON DID NOT LIKE CHANGING FROM LADY'S MAID TO NURSE AND I WAS AFRAID THAT IF I TOOK HER NEAR HER OLD HOME AND AMONGST HER OWN PEOPLE SHE MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE ME BUT POOR BABY WAS TAKEN ILL AT OXENHAM WITH HIS TEETHING
NOW MARGARET I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY BOY IS AND SOMETIMES I THINK I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN MARGARET SAT DOWN BY HER MOTHER'S SOFA ON A LITTLE STOOL AND SOFTLY TOOK HOLD OF HER HAND
BUT I CHARGE YOU MARGARET AS YOU YOURSELF HOPE FOR COMFORT IN YOUR LAST ILLNESS BRING HIM TO ME THAT I MAY BLESS HIM ONLY FOR FIVE MINUTES MARGARET THERE COULD BE NO DANGER IN FIVE MINUTES OH MARGARET LET ME SEE HIM BEFORE I DIE
INDULGENCE WAS DUE TO A WEAK BROTHER WAS IT LESS DUE TO THE BROTHER WHOSE WEAKNESS CONSISTED IN THE EXCESS OF HIS LOVE FOR AN ANCIENT A DECENT A BEAUTIFUL RITUAL ASSOCIATED IN HIS IMAGINATION FROM CHILDHOOD WITH ALL THAT IS MOST SUBLIME AND ENDEARING
IT IS A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN THIS COPY ALMOST THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE BILL CAN BE READ IN SPITE OF CANCELLATIONS AND INTERLINEATIONS
AS DAYS PASSED ON I BECAME CONSIDERABLY RECONCILED TO BARTLEBY HIS STEADINESS HIS FREEDOM FROM ALL DISSIPATION HIS INCESSANT INDUSTRY EXCEPT WHEN HE CHOSE TO THROW HIMSELF INTO A STANDING REVERY BEHIND HIS SCREEN
HIS GREAT STILLNESS HIS UNALTERABLENESS OF DEMEANOR UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES MADE HIM A VALUABLE ACQUISITION ONE PRIME THING WAS THIS HE WAS ALWAYS THERE FIRST IN THE MORNING CONTINUALLY THROUGH THE DAY AND THE LAST AT NIGHT
INTRODUCED INTO HER MAJESTIC CHOIRS WHY SHOULD HIS FEELINGS HIS PREJUDICES IF PREJUDICES THEY WERE BE LESS CONSIDERED THAN THE WHIMS OF SCHISMATICS IF AS BURNET AND MEN LIKE BURNET WERE NEVER WEARY OF REPEATING
IN THIS RESPECT AS IN MANY OTHERS THE HISTORY OF PURITANISM IN ENGLAND BEARS A CLOSE ANALOGY TO THE HISTORY OF PROTESTANTISM IN EUROPE THE PARLIAMENT OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE COULD NO MORE PUT AN END TO NONCONFORMITY BY TOLERATING A GARB OR A POSTURE
THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT OF QUARREL WAS ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE INQUIRING SPIRIT WHICH HAD BEEN ROUSED BY A SINGLE ABUSE HAD DISCOVERED OR IMAGINED A THOUSAND CONTROVERSIES ENGENDERED CONTROVERSIES
IN A NEWSPAPER A FEW CRUMBS OF GINGER NUTS AND A MORSEL OF CHEESE YES THOUGHT I IT IS EVIDENT ENOUGH THAT BARTLEBY HAS BEEN MAKING HIS HOME HERE KEEPING BACHELOR'S HALL ALL BY HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY THEN THE THOUGHT CAME SWEEPING ACROSS ME
SHALL I ACKNOWLEDGE IT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS WHOLE BUSINESS WAS THAT IT SOON BECAME A FIXED FACT OF MY CHAMBERS THAT A PALE YOUNG SCRIVENER BY THE NAME OF BARTLEBY AND A DESK THERE
THE TWO BILLS HAD A COMMON ORIGIN AND TO A GREAT EXTENT A COMMON OBJECT THEY WERE FRAMED AT THE SAME TIME AND LAID ASIDE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SANK TOGETHER INTO OBLIVION
BORE THE FAINT IMPRESS OF A LEAN RECLINING FORM ROLLED AWAY UNDER HIS DESK I FOUND A BLANKET UNDER THE EMPTY GRATE A BLACKING BOX AND BRUSH ON A CHAIR A TIN BASIN WITH SOAP AND A RAGGED TOWEL
THE EFFECT OF THIS DIVISION AMONG THE FRIENDS OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WAS THAT THE HIGH CHURCHMEN THOUGH A MINORITY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND NOT A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS WERE ABLE TO OPPOSE WITH SUCCESS BOTH THE REFORMS WHICH THEY DREADED
IT IS NOT SELDOM THE CASE THAT WHEN A MAN IS BROWBEATEN IN SOME UNPRECEDENTED AND VIOLENTLY UNREASONABLE WAY HE BEGINS TO STAGGER IN HIS OWN PLAINEST FAITH HE BEGINS AS IT WERE VAGUELY TO SURMISE THAT
AT THE MOMENT I HALF INTENDED SOMETHING OF THE KIND BUT UPON THE WHOLE AS IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS MY DINNER HOUR I THOUGHT IT BEST TO PUT ON MY HAT AND WALK HOME FOR THE DAY SUFFERING MUCH FROM PERPLEXITY AND DISTRESS OF MIND
AND THEN HE WILL BE RUDELY TREATED AND PERHAPS DRIVEN FORTH MISERABLY TO STARVE YES HERE I CAN CHEAPLY PURCHASE A DELICIOUS SELF APPROVAL TO BEFRIEND BARTLEBY TO HUMOR HIM IN HIS STRANGE WILLFULNESS WILL COST ME LITTLE OR NOTHING
THAT HE COPIED FOR ME AT THE USUAL RATE OF FOUR CENTS A FOLIO ONE HUNDRED WORDS BUT HE WAS PERMANENTLY EXEMPT FROM EXAMINING THE WORK DONE BY HIM THAT DUTY BEING TRANSFERRED TO TURKEY AND NIPPERS ONE OF COMPLIMENT DOUBTLESS TO THEIR SUPERIOR ACUTENESS
AND WAS AT LAST COLDLY AND LANGUIDLY DEFENDED EVEN BY THOSE WHO HAD INTRODUCED IT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AT WHICH THE TOLERATION BILL BECAME LAW WITH THE GENERAL CONCURRENCE OF PUBLIC MEN THE COMPREHENSION BILL WAS
UNDER THE DECLARATION OF INDULGENCE HAD BEEN ILLICIT AND PRECARIOUS THE SITUATION OF THESE MEN WAS SUCH AS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE DIVINES OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH MIGHT WELL ENVY FEW INDEED OF THE PAROCHIAL CLERGY WERE SO ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED WITH COMFORTS
I LOOKED ROUND ANXIOUSLY PEEPED BEHIND HIS SCREEN
ALARMED AT THE EFFECT OF INCAUTIOUSLY ROUSING TURKEY'S COMBATIVENESS AFTER DINNER SIT DOWN TURKEY SAID I AND HEAR WHAT NIPPERS HAS TO SAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT NIPPERS WOULD I NOT BE JUSTIFIED IN IMMEDIATELY DISMISSING BARTLEBY EXCUSE ME
BUT UPON APPLYING IT TO THE LOCK I FOUND IT RESISTED BY SOMETHING INSERTED FROM THE INSIDE QUITE SURPRISED I CALLED OUT WHEN TO MY CONSTERNATION A KEY WAS TURNED FROM WITHIN AND THRUSTING HIS LEAN VISAGE AT ME AND HOLDING THE DOOR AJAR
HE SAYS A SECOND TIME HE WON'T EXAMINE HIS PAPERS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT TURKEY IT WAS AFTERNOON BE IT REMEMBERED TURKEY SAT GLOWING LIKE A BRASS BOILER HIS BALD HEAD STEAMING HIS HANDS REELING AMONG HIS BLOTTED PAPERS THINK OF IT
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS AM I NOT RIGHT WITH SUBMISSION SIR SAID TURKEY WITH HIS BLANDEST TONE I THINK THAT YOU ARE NIPPERS SAID I WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT I THINK I SHOULD KICK HIM OUT OF THE OFFICE
ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH THE PURITANS REGARD AS THE BLEMISHES OF THE CHURCH ARE BY A LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION RECKONED AMONG HER ATTRACTIONS MAY SHE NOT IN CEASING TO GIVE SCANDAL TO A FEW SOUR PRECISIANS
ONE SECTION OF THAT PARTY WAS FOR RELIEVING THE DISSENTERS FROM THE TEST ACT AND GIVING UP THE COMPREHENSION BILL ANOTHER SECTION WAS FOR PUSHING FORWARD THE COMPREHENSION BILL AND POSTPONING TO A MORE CONVENIENT TIME THE CONSIDERATION OF THE TEST ACT
IT IS PLAIN HE INTENDS NO INSOLENCE HIS ASPECT SUFFICIENTLY EVINCES THAT HIS ECCENTRICITIES ARE INVOLUNTARY HE IS USEFUL TO ME I CAN GET ALONG WITH HIM IF I TURN HIM AWAY THE CHANCES ARE HE WILL FALL IN WITH SOME LESS INDULGENT EMPLOYER
TENANTING MY LAW CHAMBERS OF A SUNDAY MORNING WITH HIS CADAVEROUSLY GENTLEMANLY NONCHALANCE YET WITHAL FIRM AND SELF POSSESSED HAD SUCH A STRANGE EFFECT UPON ME THAT INCONTINENTLY I SLUNK AWAY FROM MY OWN DOOR AND DID AS DESIRED
FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWING HER TERROR IN THE TONES OF HER VOICE SHUT DOWN THE WINDOWS INSTANTLY MOTHER EXCLAIMED HE THE GATES WON'T BEAR SUCH ANOTHER SHOCK SHUT DOWN THAT WINDOW MISS HALE
ASKED FANNY IN A QUAVERING VOICE NO ANSWER NO SIGN OF RECOGNITION BUT A FAINT PINK COLOUR RETURNED TO HER LIPS ALTHOUGH THE REST OF HER FACE WAS ASHEN PALE MISSUS THORNTON CAME HURRIEDLY IN WITH THE NEAREST SURGEON SHE COULD FIND
HE WENT AWAY AS IF WEIGHTS WERE TIED TO EVERY LIMB THAT BORE HIM FROM HER HE CALLED JANE HE CALLED HIS SISTER SHE SHOULD HAVE ALL WOMANLY CARE ALL GENTLE TENDANCE BUT EVERY PULSE BEAT IN HIM AS HE REMEMBERED
HITHERTO THEY HAD BEEN VOICELESS WORDLESS NEEDING ALL THEIR BREATH FOR THEIR HARD LABOURING EFFORTS TO BREAK DOWN THE GATES BUT NOW HEARING HIM SPEAK INSIDE THEY SET UP SUCH A FIERCE UNEARTHLY GROAN
INARTICULATELY AS HE SPOKE KNEELING BY HER AND RATHER MOANING THAN SAYING THE WORDS HE STARTED UP ASHAMED OF HIMSELF AS HIS MOTHER CAME IN SHE SAW NOTHING BUT HER SON A LITTLE PALER
BUT THAT GIRL MUST NOT BLEED TO DEATH BLEED OH HOW HORRID HOW
NOT UNTIL I HAVE APPLIED SOME STRIPS OF PLASTER AND YOU HAVE RESTED A LITTLE
THOSE NEAREST THE GATE STOLE OUT ASHAMED THERE WAS A MOVEMENT THROUGH ALL THE CROWD A RETREATING MOVEMENT
HE MADE SOME LITTLE CALCULATION SUPPOSING WILLIAMS GOT STRAIGHT OFF WHEN I TOLD HIM AND HADN'T TO DODGE ABOUT AMONGST THEM
DID SHE GET THERE NAY MISS THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY ANSWERED JANE WITH A SLIGHT TOSS OF HER HEAD SARAH DID' SARAH WHAT SAID FANNY WITH IMPATIENT CURIOSITY
OH MY MARGARET MY MARGARET NO ONE CAN TELL WHAT YOU ARE TO ME DEAD COLD AS YOU LIE THERE YOU ARE THE ONLY WOMAN I EVER LOVED
AND SHE GLANCED UP AT JANE AS IF SHRINKING FROM HER INSPECTION MORE THAN FROM THE DOCTOR'S
WHO IS BOUCHER ASKED MISTER THORNTON COOLLY AND COMING CLOSE TO THE WINDOW TO DISCOVER THE MAN IN WHOM MARGARET TOOK SUCH AN INTEREST AS SOON AS THEY SAW MISTER THORNTON THEY SET UP A YELL TO CALL IT NOT HUMAN IS NOTHING
IF YOU HAVE ANY COURAGE OR NOBLE QUALITY IN YOU
HOW SHE HAD COME DOWN AND PLACED HERSELF IN FOREMOST DANGER COULD IT BE TO SAVE HIM AT THE TIME HE HAD PUSHED HER ASIDE AND SPOKEN GRUFFLY
BUT IF NOT YOU WILL BE SAFER THERE THAN HERE GO JANE CONTINUED HE ADDRESSING THE UPPER SERVANT AND SHE WENT FOLLOWED BY THE OTHERS I STOP HERE SAID HIS MOTHER WHERE YOU ARE THERE I STAY
IT IS AWFUL TO SEE THEM THE SOLDIERS WILL BE HERE DIRECTLY AND THAT WILL BRING THEM TO REASON TO REASON SAID MARGARET QUICKLY WHAT KIND OF REASON THE ONLY REASON THAT DOES WITH MEN THAT MAKE THEMSELVES INTO WILD BEASTS
PERHAPS I MAY ASK YOU TO ACCOMPANY ME DOWNSTAIRS AND BAR THE DOOR BEHIND ME MY MOTHER AND SISTER WILL NEED THAT PROTECTION
THAT SHE WOULD ASK FOR WHATEVER THEY MIGHT WANT IN THE PROGRESS OF HER MOTHER'S ILLNESS MISSUS THORNTON'S BROW CONTRACTED AND HER MOUTH GREW SET WHILE MARGARET SPOKE WITH GENTLE MODESTY OF HER MOTHER'S RESTLESSNESS AND DOCTOR DONALDSON'S WISH
SHE SAW IT WAS THE SPARK TO THE GUNPOWDER AND WITH A CRY WHICH NO ONE HEARD SHE RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM DOWN STAIRS SHE HAD LIFTED THE GREAT IRON BAR OF THE DOOR WITH AN IMPERIOUS FORCE HAD THROWN THE DOOR OPEN WIDE AND WAS THERE
DID THEY THROW STONES INTO THE DRAWING ROOM MARGARET DID INDEED LOOK WHITE AND WAN ALTHOUGH HER SENSES WERE BEGINNING TO RETURN TO HER BUT THE SICKLY DAZE OF THE SWOON MADE HER STILL MISERABLY FAINT
NO JANE IF YOU DON'T GO I DO MISSUS THORNTON WENT FIRST TO THE ROOM IN WHICH SHE HAD LEFT FANNY STRETCHED ON THE BED SHE STARTED UP AS HER MOTHER ENTERED OH MAMMA HOW YOU TERRIFIED ME
MARGARET KNEW IT ALL SHE READ IT IN BOUCHER'S FACE FORLORNLY DESPERATE AND LIVID WITH RAGE IF MISTER THORNTON WOULD BUT SAY SOMETHING TO THEM LET THEM HEAR HIS VOICE ONLY
SHE COULD ONLY SEE FOR IF MISTER THORNTON HAD INDEED MADE THE ATTEMPT TO SPEAK
SLOWER PLASH THAN EVEN TEARS CAME THE DRIP OF BLOOD FROM HER WOUND EVEN THE MOST DESPERATE BOUCHER HIMSELF DREW BACK FALTERED AWAY SCOWLED AND FINALLY WENT OFF
AND THE STUPID WRETCHES HERE WOULDN'T WORK FOR HIM
THEY WERE LIKE BOUCHER WITH STARVING CHILDREN AT HOME RELYING ON ULTIMATE SUCCESS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO GET HIGHER WAGES AND ENRAGED BEYOND MEASURE AT DISCOVERING THAT IRISHMEN WERE TO BE BROUGHT IN TO ROB THEIR LITTLE ONES OF BREAD
THERE IS NO WOMAN TO SHIELD ME HERE YOU MAY BEAT ME TO DEATH YOU WILL NEVER MOVE ME FROM WHAT I HAVE DETERMINED UPON NOT YOU HE STOOD AMONGST THEM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED IN PRECISELY THE SAME ATTITUDE
ARE THEY GONE ASKED SHE IN A WHISPER GONE REPLIED HE LISTEN SHE DID LISTEN THEY ALL COULD HEAR THE ONE GREAT STRAINING BREATH THE CREAK OF WOOD SLOWLY YIELDING THE WRENCH OF IRON
AND OF REFRESHMENT FROM THE EAU DE COLOGNE AND A CRAVING FOR THE BATHING TO GO ON WITHOUT INTERMISSION BUT WHEN THEY STOPPED TO TALK SHE COULD NO MORE HAVE OPENED HER EYES OR SPOKEN TO ASK FOR MORE BATHING THAN THE PEOPLE WHO LIE IN DEATH LIKE TRANCE CAN MOVE OR UTTER SOUND
AND YET THERE WAS NO WIND IT DIED AWAY INTO PROFOUND STILLNESS BETWEEN WHILES FANNY CAME IN AT LAST MAMMA WILL COME DIRECTLY MISS HALE SHE DESIRED ME TO APOLOGISE TO YOU AS IT IS
IF SHE THOUGHT HER SEX WOULD BE A PROTECTION IF WITH SHRINKING EYES SHE HAD TURNED AWAY FROM THE TERRIBLE ANGER OF THESE MEN IN ANY HOPE THAT ERE SHE LOOKED AGAIN THEY WOULD HAVE PAUSED AND REFLECTED AND SLUNK AWAY AND VANISHED SHE WAS WRONG
THEN I AM INCLINED ONLY TO PERCEIVE BARBARIAN HABITS AND THE OPINIONS OF SAVAGES IN WHAT WE STYLE FEUDAL PRINCIPLES
NONE OF THE INDIAN TRIBES WHICH FORMERLY INHABITED THE TERRITORY OF NEW ENGLAND THE NARAGANSETTS
WHILST IT WAS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GIVE A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF ITS CHANCES OF DURATION INDEPENDENTLY OF ITS LAWS AND MANNERS WHEN SPEAKING OF THE UNITED REPUBLICAN STATES I HAZARDED NO CONJECTURES UPON THE PERMANENCE OF REPUBLICAN FORMS IN THE NEW WORLD
WHICH FORMED A STRANGE CONTRAST WITH HER INFANTINE WEAKNESS
THE LATTER MEETS WITH A THOUSAND OBSTACLES IN RAISING THE FRUITS OF THE EARTH THE EUROPEAN IS PLACED AMONGST A POPULATION WHOSE WANTS HE KNOWS AND PARTAKES THE SAVAGE IS ISOLATED IN THE MIDST OF A HOSTILE PEOPLE
HE HAS NEVER BENT HIS WILL TO THAT OF ANY OF HIS KIND
IF WE REASONED FROM WHAT PASSES IN THE WORLD WE SHOULD ALMOST SAY THAT THE EUROPEAN IS TO THE OTHER RACES OF MANKIND WHAT MAN IS TO THE LOWER ANIMALS HE MAKES THEM SUBSERVIENT TO HIS USE AND WHEN HE CANNOT SUBDUE HE DESTROYS THEM
ON THE SOUTH IT ADVANCES NEARLY TO THE TROPIC AND IT EXTENDS UPWARDS TO THE ICY REGIONS OF THE NORTH THE HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SCATTERED OVER THIS SPACE DO NOT FORM AS IN EUROPE SO MANY BRANCHES OF THE SAME STOCK THREE RACES NATURALLY DISTINCT
THE NEGRO WHO IS PLUNGED IN THIS ABYSS OF EVILS SCARCELY FEELS HIS OWN CALAMITOUS SITUATION VIOLENCE MADE HIM A SLAVE
I ARRIVED ONE DAY AT THE LOG HOUSE OF A PIONEER I DID NOT WISH TO PENETRATE INTO THE DWELLING OF THE AMERICAN BUT RETIRED TO REST MYSELF FOR A WHILE ON THE MARGIN OF A SPRING WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF IN THE WOODS
AND HAVE BEGUN HIS SLAVERY BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS EXISTENCE
THE TERRITORY NOW OCCUPIED OR CLAIMED BY THE AMERICAN UNION SPREADS FROM THE SHORES OF THE ATLANTIC TO THOSE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN ON THE EAST AND WEST ITS LIMITS ARE THOSE OF THE CONTINENT ITSELF
AND LIVES AND DIES IN THE MIDST OF THESE DREAMS OF PRIDE FAR FROM DESIRING TO CONFORM HIS HABITS TO OURS HE LOVES HIS SAVAGE LIFE AS THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF HIS RACE AND HE REPELS EVERY ADVANCE TO CIVILIZATION LESS PERHAPS FROM THE HATRED WHICH HE ENTERTAINS FOR IT
SAVAGE NATIONS ARE ONLY CONTROLLED BY OPINION AND BY CUSTOM WHEN THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS HAD LOST THE SENTIMENT OF ATTACHMENT TO THEIR COUNTRY WHEN THEIR FAMILIES WERE DISPERSED THEIR TRADITIONS OBSCURED AND THE CHAIN OF THEIR RECOLLECTIONS BROKEN
AND ARE GUIDED BY THESE WILD ANIMALS IN THE CHOICE OF THEIR FUTURE COUNTRY
CIVILIZATION HAS LITTLE POWER OVER HIM
HE CANNOT ALWAYS MEET WITH A PURCHASER WHILST THE EUROPEAN READILY FINDS A MARKET AND THE FORMER CAN ONLY PRODUCE AT A CONSIDERABLE COST THAT WHICH THE LATTER VENDS AT A VERY LOW RATE THUS THE INDIAN HAS NO SOONER ESCAPED THOSE EVILS TO WHICH BARBAROUS NATIONS ARE EXPOSED
IN EACH OF HIS FEATURES HE DISCOVERS A TRACE OF SLAVERY AND IF IT WERE IN HIS POWER HE WOULD WILLINGLY RID HIMSELF OF EVERYTHING THAT MAKES HIM WHAT HE IS THE INDIAN ON THE CONTRARY HAS HIS IMAGINATION INFLATED WITH THE PRETENDED NOBILITY OF HIS ORIGIN
GRADUAL DISAPPEARANCE OF THE NATIVE TRIBES MANNER IN WHICH IT TAKES PLACE MISERIES ACCOMPANYING THE FORCED MIGRATIONS OF THE INDIANS THE SAVAGES OF NORTH AMERICA HAD ONLY TWO WAYS OF ESCAPING DESTRUCTION WAR OR CIVILIZATION
WHEN ALL THEIR HABITS WERE CHANGED AND THEIR WANTS INCREASED BEYOND MEASURE
I HAD PERCEIVED FROM MANY DIFFERENT RESULTS THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE WHITES BUT IN THE PICTURE WHICH I HAVE JUST BEEN DESCRIBING THERE WAS SOMETHING PECULIARLY TOUCHING A BOND OF AFFECTION HERE UNITED THE OPPRESSORS WITH THE OPPRESSED
RINGS OF METAL WERE HANGING FROM HER NOSTRILS AND EARS
THE MORAL AND PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THESE TRIBES CONTINUALLY GREW WORSE AND THEY BECAME MORE BARBAROUS AS THEY BECAME MORE WRETCHED NEVERTHELESS THE EUROPEANS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO METAMORPHOSE THE CHARACTER OF THE INDIANS
ENDURING THE VICISSITUDES AND PRACTISING THE VIRTUES AND VICES COMMON TO SAVAGE NATIONS THE EUROPEANS HAVING DISPERSED THE INDIAN TRIBES AND DRIVEN THEM INTO THE DESERTS CONDEMNED THEM TO A WANDERING LIFE FULL OF INEXPRESSIBLE SUFFERINGS
AND HE IS DESTITUTE OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND ENERGY NECESSARY TO RESIST THEM THESE ARE MASTERS WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO CONTEND WITH AND HE HAS LEARNT ONLY TO SUBMIT AND OBEY
AND SLAVERY DOES NOT PRODUCE MORE FATAL EFFECTS UPON THE FIRST THAN INDEPENDENCE UPON THE SECOND THE NEGRO HAS LOST ALL PROPERTY IN HIS OWN PERSON AND HE CANNOT DISPOSE OF HIS EXISTENCE WITHOUT COMMITTING A SORT OF FRAUD
WHILST THE SAVAGE DISPLAYED IN THE MIDST OF HER TENDERNESS AN AIR OF FREEDOM AND OF PRIDE WHICH WAS ALMOST FEROCIOUS
WHICH WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CREEK TERRITORY AN INDIAN WOMAN APPEARED FOLLOWED BY A NEGRESS AND HOLDING BY THE HAND A LITTLE WHITE GIRL OF FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD WHOM I TOOK TO BE THE DAUGHTER OF THE PIONEER A SORT OF BARBAROUS LUXURY SET OFF THE COSTUME OF THE INDIAN
THE NEGRESS WAS SEATED ON THE GROUND BEFORE HER MISTRESS WATCHING HER SMALLEST DESIRES
AND WHY THEY CANNOT BECOME SO NOW THAT THEY DESIRE IT INSTANCE OF THE CREEKS AND CHEROKEES POLICY OF THE PARTICULAR STATES TOWARDS THESE INDIANS
ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS HAD BEEN RAISED BETWEEN THEM BY EDUCATION AND BY LAW AS WELL AS BY THEIR ORIGIN AND OUTWARD CHARACTERISTICS BUT FORTUNE HAS BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER ON THE SAME SOIL WHERE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MIXED THEY DO NOT AMALGAMATE
AND EVEN IN OUR MOST INGENIOUS HANDICRAFT HE CAN SEE NOTHING BUT THE LABOR OF SLAVES NOT THAT HE IS DEVOID OF ADMIRATION FOR THE POWER AND INTELLECTUAL GREATNESS OF THE WHITES BUT ALTHOUGH THE RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS SURPRISES HIM
WITH WHOSE MANNERS LANGUAGE AND LAWS HE IS IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED BUT WITHOUT WHOSE ASSISTANCE HE CANNOT LIVE
THE NEGRESS WAS CLAD IN SQUALID EUROPEAN GARMENTS THEY ALL THREE CAME AND SEATED THEMSELVES UPON THE BANKS OF THE FOUNTAIN
WHO FORESEE THE FINAL DESTINY WHICH AWAITS THE NATIVE POPULATION AND WHO EXERT THEMSELVES TO UNITE ALL THE TRIBES IN COMMON HOSTILITY TO THE EUROPEANS BUT THEIR EFFORTS ARE UNAVAILING
IF HE BECOMES FREE INDEPENDENCE IS OFTEN FELT BY HIM TO BE A HEAVIER BURDEN THAN SLAVERY FOR HAVING LEARNED IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE TO SUBMIT TO EVERYTHING EXCEPT REASON HE IS TOO MUCH UNACQUAINTED WITH HER DICTATES TO OBEY THEM
AND EACH RACE FULFILS ITS DESTINY APART
ALL SERENE REPLIED STUMPY ANYTHING UP NOTHING THERE WAS A PAUSE AN EMBARRASSING ONE STUMPY STILL HOLDING THE DOOR THEN KENTUCK HAD RECOURSE TO HIS FINGER WHICH HE HELD UP TO STUMPY
LAY THE LAST ARRIVAL AT ROARING CAMP BESIDE THE CANDLE BOX WAS PLACED A HAT ITS USE WAS SOON INDICATED GENTLEMEN SAID STUMPY WITH A SINGULAR MIXTURE OF AUTHORITY AND EX OFFICIO COMPLACENCY
ALSO MET WITH OBJECTION IT WAS ARGUED THAT NO DECENT WOMAN COULD BE PREVAILED TO ACCEPT ROARING CAMP AS HER HOME AND THE SPEAKER URGED THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY MORE OF THE OTHER KIND THIS UNKIND ALLUSION TO THE DEFUNCT MOTHER
IT WAS KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN AND WHITEWASHED THEN IT WAS BOARDED CLOTHED AND PAPERED THE ROSE WOOD CRADLE PACKED EIGHTY MILES BY MULE HAD IN STUMPY'S WAY OF PUTTING IT SORTER KILLED THE REST OF THE FURNITURE
THE LUCK WAS USUALLY CARRIED TO THE GULCH FROM WHENCE THE GOLDEN STORE OF ROARING CAMP WAS TAKEN THERE ON A BLANKET SPREAD OVER PINE BOUGHS HE WOULD LIE WHILE THE MEN WERE WORKING IN THE DITCHES BELOW
EYEING THE FACES AROUND HIM BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT THIS THING AIN'T EXACTLY ON THE SQUAR IT'S PLAYING IT PRETTY LOW DOWN ON THIS YER BABY TO RING IN FUN ON HIM THAT HE AIN'T GOIN TO UNDERSTAND
THE DAMNED LITTLE CUSS HE SAID AS HE EXTRICATED HIS FINGER WITH PERHAPS MORE TENDERNESS AND CARE THAN HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEEMED CAPABLE OF SHOWING HE HELD THAT FINGER A LITTLE APART FROM ITS FELLOWS AS HE WENT OUT
I CREP UP THE BANK JUST NOW SAID KENTUCK ONE DAY IN A BREATHLESS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY A CHANGE CAME OVER THE SETTLEMENT THE CABIN ASSIGNED TO TOMMY LUCK OR THE LUCK AS HE WAS MORE FREQUENTLY CALLED FIRST SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT
HAD SPENT TWO DAYS IN PREPARING A BURLESQUE OF THE CHURCH SERVICE WITH POINTED LOCAL ALLUSIONS THE CHOIR WAS PROPERLY TRAINED AND SANDY TIPTON WAS TO STAND GODFATHER
BUT IN CONSIDERATION OF THE SITUATION OF THE MOTHER BETTER COUNSELS PREVAILED
SHE WOULD SEND WANDERING BREEZES TO VISIT HIM WITH THE BALM OF BAY AND RESINOUS GUM
BY THE TIME HE WAS A MONTH OLD THE NECESSITY OF GIVING HIM A NAME BECAME APPARENT HE HAD GENERALLY BEEN KNOWN AS THE KID STUMPY'S BOY THE COYOTE
KEPT THE RESERVE OF ROARING CAMP INVIOLATE THE EXPRESSMAN THEIR ONLY CONNECTING LINK WITH THE SURROUNDING WORLD SOMETIMES TOLD WONDERFUL STORIES OF THE CAMP HE WOULD SAY THEY'VE A STREET UP THERE IN ROARING
THE BUMBLEBEES BUZZED AND THE ROOKS CAWED A SLUMBROUS ACCOMPANIMENT SUCH WAS THE GOLDEN SUMMER OF ROARING CAMP THEY WERE FLUSH TIMES AND THE LUCK WAS WITH THEM
IT BEEN HERE ONCE AND WILL BE HERE AGAIN AND THAT NIGHT THE NORTH FORK SUDDENLY LEAPED OVER ITS BANKS AND SWEPT UP THE TRIANGULAR VALLEY OF ROARING CAMP
STUMPY WAS RETAINED CERTAIN ARTICLES WERE SENT FOR TO SACRAMENTO MIND SAID THE TREASURER AS HE PRESSED A BAG OF GOLD DUST INTO THE EXPRESSMAN'S HAND THE BEST THAT CAN BE GOT LACE YOU KNOW AND FILIGREE WORK AND FRILLS
THE LAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN WALL THAT SURROUNDED THE CAMP THEY DULY PREEMPTED THIS
MUST NOT BE DISTURBED BY NOISE
AND DID THEY BELONG HERE IT NEEDED BUT A GLANCE TO SHOW THEM KENTUCK LYING THERE CRUELLY CRUSHED AND BRUISED BUT STILL HOLDING THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP IN HIS ARMS
RASTLED WITH IT THE
CALL HIM LUCK AND START HIM FAIR A DAY WAS ACCORDINGLY SET APART FOR THE CHRISTENING WHAT WAS MEANT BY THIS CEREMONY THE READER MAY IMAGINE WHO HAS ALREADY GATHERED SOME IDEA
RED DOG HAD BEEN TWICE UNDER WATER AND ROARING CAMP HAD BEEN FOREWARNED
WHICH LIKE A SNAKE'S ONLY SLOUGHED OFF THROUGH DECAY TO BE DEBARRED THIS PRIVILEGE FROM CERTAIN PRUDENTIAL REASONS YET SUCH WAS THE SUBTLE INFLUENCE OF INNOVATION THAT HE THEREAFTER APPEARED REGULARLY EVERY AFTERNOON IN A CLEAN SHIRT AND FACE
BUT SAID STUMPY QUICKLY FOLLOWING UP HIS ADVANTAGE WE'RE HERE FOR A CHRISTENING AND WE'LL HAVE IT I PROCLAIM YOU THOMAS LUCK ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
BUT NOW TERRIBLE IN HER LONELINESS THE PRIMAL CURSE HAD COME TO HER IN THAT ORIGINAL ISOLATION WHICH MUST HAVE MADE THE PUNISHMENT OF THE FIRST TRANSGRESSION SO DREADFUL IT WAS PERHAPS PART OF THE EXPIATION OF HER SIN
THE ASSEMBLAGE NUMBERED ABOUT A HUNDRED MEN ONE OR TWO OF THESE WERE ACTUAL FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE SOME WERE CRIMINAL AND ALL WERE RECKLESS PHYSICALLY THEY EXHIBITED NO INDICATION OF THEIR PAST LIVES AND CHARACTER
HENCE THE EXCITEMENT YOU GO IN THERE STUMPY SAID A PROMINENT CITIZEN KNOWN AS KENTUCK ADDRESSING ONE OF THE LOUNGERS GO IN THERE AND SEE WHAT YOU KIN DO YOU'VE HAD EXPERIENCE IN THEM THINGS
SO THE REHABILITATION OF THE CABIN BECAME A NECESSITY THE MEN WHO WERE IN THE HABIT OF LOUNGING IN AT STUMPY'S TO SEE HOW THE LUCK GOT ON SEEMED TO APPRECIATE THE CHANGE
HE SAID AND RETIRED THE NEXT DAY CHEROKEE SAL HAD SUCH RUDE SEPULTURE AS ROARING CAMP AFFORDED
WAS THE FIRST SPASM OF PROPRIETY THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF THE CAMP'S REGENERATION STUMPY ADVANCED NOTHING PERHAPS HE FELT A CERTAIN DELICACY IN INTERFERING WITH THE SELECTION OF A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR IN OFFICE
THAN THE ANCIENT TREATMENT OF ROMULUS AND REMUS AND APPARENTLY AS SUCCESSFUL WHEN THESE DETAILS WERE COMPLETED WHICH EXHAUSTED ANOTHER HOUR THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND THE ANXIOUS CROWD OF MEN
I HURLED MY SANDWICH CASE AT THE BRUTE IN FACT I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT MORE I COULD HAVE DONE AND STILL WE LUMBERED ON THROUGH THE DEEPENING DUSK WITH THAT DARK UNCOUTH SHAPE LUMBERING AHEAD OF US
AN UPLAND TOWNSHIP IN ONE OF THOSE SMALL PRINCEDOMS THAT MAKE INCONSPICUOUS FRECKLES ON THE MAP OF CENTRAL EUROPE A LONG STANDING ACQUAINTANCESHIP WITH THE REIGNING FAMILY
AND PRODUCED RED PEPPER AND SLICED LEMON WHERE SO MANY WOMEN WOULD MERELY HAVE PRODUCED REASONS AND REGRETS FOR NOT HAVING ANY CUSHAT PRINKLY FOUND THAT HE WAS ENJOYING AN EXCELLENT TEA
IF YOU'LL FORGET GOODWOOD FOR A MOMENT AND LISTEN TO ME I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS SOME FORTY MINUTES LATER JAMES CUSHAT PRINKLY RETURNED TO THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY BEARING AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF NEWS
AND HE STOOD NERVELESSLY HELPLESSLY DUMBLY WATCHING THE CHILD
THE IMPORTANT BUSINESS WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM BY SPINNING OUT HIS VISIT HE COULD CONTRIVE TO REACH THE SEBASTABLE MANSION AFTER THE LAST VESTIGES OF DAINTY PORCELAIN HAD BEEN CLEARED AWAY
WHEN ON PUSHING OUR WAY THROUGH AN ACCOMMODATING HEDGE WE WERE GLADDENED BY THE SIGHT OF HOUNDS IN FULL CRY IN A HOLLOW JUST BENEATH US THERE THEY GO CRIED CONSTANCE
YOU AROUSE NOT MERELY MY CURIOSITY BUT MY BUSINESS INSTINCTS I HOPE YOU'VE COME ABOUT HATS I HEARD THAT YOU HAD COME INTO A LEGACY THE OTHER DAY
FOR WE LOST THE HOUNDS AND FOUND OURSELVES PLODDING AIMLESSLY ALONG MILES AWAY FROM ANYWHERE IT WAS FAIRLY EXASPERATING AND MY TEMPER WAS BEGINNING TO LET ITSELF GO BY INCHES
MY HOME MAY BE AN UNHAPPY ONE BUT AT LEAST IT HAS HOT AND COLD WATER LAID ON AND DOMESTIC SERVICE AND OTHER CONVENIENCES WHICH WE SHOULDN'T FIND HERE WE HAD BETTER MAKE FOR THAT RIDGE OF TREES TO THE RIGHT
SHE NEVER FORGOT THE SCENE BUT THEN IT WAS THE LAST SHE EVER SAW
JAMES CUSHAT PRINKLY WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS HAD A SETTLED CONVICTION THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS HE WOULD MARRY UP TO THE AGE OF THIRTY FOUR HE HAD DONE NOTHING TO JUSTIFY THAT CONVICTION
IT WAS ONLY FOR THE FRACTION OF A MINUTE THAT SHE STOOD WATCHING THE TWO ENTANGLED FIGURES THE INFANT WITH ITS WOODENLY OBSTINATE FACE
AND WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING OURSELVES IN THE FIRST FLIGHT THOUGH IT WAS A FAIRLY STIFF RUN
THE MOTHER WAS UNOBTRUSIVE AND LESS FUSSY THAN MOST PARENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THE CAB HAD STARTED AT HOT PACE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STATION THE NEXT MOMENT LESTER WAS RUNNING RUNNING FASTER THAN ANY OF THOSE PRESENT HAD EVER SEEN A MAN RUN AND
SHE ANNOUNCED THERE'S CAVIARE IN THAT JAR AT YOUR ELBOW BEGIN ON THAT BROWN BREAD AND BUTTER WHILE I CUT SOME MORE FIND YOURSELF A CUP THE TEAPOT IS BEHIND YOU NOW TELL ME ABOUT HUNDREDS OF THINGS
AND HIS TASTES HAD SOME CLAIM TO BE CONSIDERED ON A SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON OF THE SAME YEAR AFTER THE HONEYMOON IN MINORCA HAD ENDED
SHE MADE NO OTHER ALLUSION TO FOOD BUT TALKED AMUSINGLY AND MADE HER VISITOR TALK AMUSINGLY TOO AT THE SAME TIME SHE CUT THE BREAD AND BUTTER WITH A MASTERLY SKILL
INCIDENTALLY TOO I LOST THE FRIENDSHIP OF CONSTANCE BRODDLE YOU SEE WHEN I SOLD THE BROOCH I QUITE PROPERLY REFUSED TO GIVE HER ANY SHARE OF THE PROCEEDS
TO HIS OWN PEOPLE HE WAS KNOWN AS A KINDLY OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A CERTAIN ENDEARING STATELINESS WHICH HAD NOTHING OF STANDOFFISHNESS ABOUT IT KNOBALTHEIM WAS ANXIOUS TO DO ITS BEST
OR MERELY SILENT AS A THING TO BE LOOKED ON AND FROM BEHIND A SILKEN CURTAIN A SMALL NUBIAN PAGE SHOULD SILENTLY BRING IN A TRAY WITH CUPS AND DAINTIES TO BE ACCEPTED SILENTLY AS A MATTER OF COURSE
NOW AS HE PASSED THROUGH A TANGLE OF SMALL STREETS THAT LED INDIRECTLY TO THE ELEGANT MAYFAIR TERRACE FOR WHICH HE WAS BOUND A HORROR AT THE IDEA OF CONFRONTING JOAN SEBASTABLE AT HER TEA TABLE SEIZED ON HIM
I IMAGINE THE CROWLEY ROAD IS JUST BEYOND WE TROTTED OFF SLOWLY ALONG A FAINTLY MARKED CART TRACK WITH THE BEAST FOLLOWING CHEERFULLY AT OUR HEELS WHAT ON EARTH ARE WE TO DO WITH THE HYAENA CAME THE INEVITABLE QUESTION
SHE WENT ON WITH A CERTAIN SHY EAGERNESS OUR LITTLE CHILD HERE OUR BABY WE WILL DRESS HIM IN LITTLE WHITE COAT WITH SMALL WINGS AS AN EASTER ANGEL AND HE WILL CARRY A LARGE WHITE EASTER EGG
HIS MEDITERRANEAN MUSINGS WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE SOUND OF A CLOCK STRIKING THE HALF HOUR HALF PAST FOUR A FROWN OF DISSATISFACTION SETTLED ON HIS FACE
BUT ONE COULD NOT HAVE A HONEYMOON IN MINORCA AND A SUBSEQUENT LIFE OF MARRIED HAPPINESS WITHOUT SUCH PRELIMINARY HE WONDERED WHAT MINORCA WAS REALLY LIKE AS A PLACE TO STOP IN
AND A SHARP SCREECHING YELL FOLLOWED A SECOND LATER THE CAR DREW UP AND WHEN I HAD RIDDEN BACK TO THE SPOT I FOUND A YOUNG MAN BENDING OVER A DARK MOTIONLESS MASS LYING BY THE ROADSIDE YOU HAVE KILLED MY ESME I
THAT WOULD DO IN EITHER CASE THERE WAS STILL SUFFICIENT DAYLIGHT FOR US TO DISTINGUISH WAYSIDE OBJECTS AND OUR LISTLESS SPIRITS GAVE AN UPWARD PERK AS WE CAME UPON A SMALL HALF NAKED GIPSY BRAT
PURSUED THE WOMAN BUT HE WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND DO AS HE IS TOLD
AND PICKED UP HIS CANE FROM THE GROUND A PROCEEDING TO WHICH I WAS PERHAPS WRONG NOT TO ATTACH SOME IMPORTANCE WE WERE NOW OUT OF THE PARK ROULETABILLE HAD DROPPED INTO SILENCE
THUS ALL WAS MADE PLAIN AND STRAIGHT AGAIN OBERON AND TITANIA LOVED EACH OTHER MORE THAN EVER DEMETRIUS THOUGHT OF NO ONE BUT HELENA AND HELENA HAD NEVER HAD ANY THOUGHT OF ANYONE BUT DEMETRIUS
LIKE YOU I THINK THAT HE FOUND IT SOMEWHERE NEAR MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC BUT IF AS YOU SUPPOSE THE MURDERER WAS IN THE YELLOW ROOM FOR FIVE OR EVEN SIX HOURS AND THE CRIME WAS NOT COMMITTED UNTIL TOWARDS MIDNIGHT
SIT DOWN WITH ME SAID THE QUEEN TO THE CLOWN AND LET ME STROKE YOUR DEAR CHEEKS AND STICK MUSK ROSES IN YOUR SMOOTH SLEEK HEAD AND KISS YOUR FAIR LARGE EARS MY GENTLE JOY WHERE'S PEASEBLOSSOM
IN HIS POCKET I CLOSELY SCRUTINISED HIM HE MIGHT BE ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE HE HAD A FINE HEAD HIS HAIR TURNING GREY A COLOURLESS COMPLEXION AND A FIRM PROFILE
LYSANDER OF COURSE WAS NEARLY MAD WITH GRIEF AND THE BEST THING TO DO SEEMED TO HIM FOR HERMIA TO RUN AWAY TO HIS AUNT'S HOUSE AT A PLACE BEYOND THE REACH OF THAT CRUEL LAW AND THERE HE WOULD COME TO HER AND MARRY HER
THE SOBS HAD CEASED IF WE CAN'T HEAR WE MAY AT LEAST TRY TO SEE SAID ROULETABILLE AND MAKING A SIGN TO ME TO DEADEN THE SOUND OF MY STEPS
AND WHERE THE OTHER TWO HAD DECIDED TO FOLLOW THEM WAS FULL OF FAIRIES AS MOST WOODS ARE IF ONE ONLY HAD THE EYES TO SEE THEM AND IN THIS WOOD ON THIS NIGHT WERE THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES OBERON AND TITANIA
IN A FOOLISH QUARREL THEY NEVER MET WITHOUT SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS TO EACH OTHER AND SCOLDED EACH OTHER SO DREADFULLY THAT ALL THEIR LITTLE FAIRY FOLLOWERS FOR FEAR WOULD CREEP INTO ACORN CUPS
COBWEB MOTH AND MUSTARDSEED YOU MUST ATTEND THIS GENTLEMAN SAID THE QUEEN FEED HIM WITH APRICOTS AND DEWBERRIES PURPLE GRAPES GREEN FIGS AND MULBERRIES STEAL HONEY BAGS FOR HIM FROM THE BUMBLE BEES
ON WHOSE EYES HE PUT THE JUICE BUT WHEN LYSANDER WOKE HE SAW NOT HIS OWN HERMIA BUT HELENA WHO WAS WALKING THROUGH THE WOOD LOOKING FOR THE CRUEL DEMETRIUS
WHILE LARSAN WAS UNLOCKING THE GATE MONSIEUR DARZAC INQUIRED WHAT HAD BROUGHT ME TO THE GLANDIER AT SUCH A TRAGIC MOMENT I NOTICED THAT HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY PALE AND THAT HIS FACE WAS LINED AS IF FROM THE EFFECTS OF SOME TERRIBLE SUFFERING IS MADEMOISELLE GETTING BETTER
BY THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE MAN WITH THE BEARD AT ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENTS OF THIS CASE I THEN LEARNED THAT THE YOUTH WAS ONE OF LARSAN'S ASSISTANTS AND HAD BEEN CHARGED BY HIM TO WATCH THE GOING AND COMING OF TRAVELLERS AT THE STATION OF EPINAY SUR ORGE
FRED PASSED THE CANE TO ROULETABILLE IT WAS A LARGE YELLOW BAMBOO WITH A CRUTCH HANDLE AND ORNAMENTED WITH A GOLD RING
NOW FAIRIES ARE VERY WISE PEOPLE BUT NOW AND THEN THEY CAN BE QUITE AS FOOLISH AS MORTAL FOLK OBERON AND TITANIA WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS HAPPY AS THE DAYS WERE LONG HAD THROWN AWAY ALL THEIR JOY
WHILE TO LARSAN IT SHOWED NOTHING BUT CONSUMMATE HYPOCRISY ACTED WITH FINISHED ART BY MADEMOISELLE STANGERSON'S FIANCE AS WE REACHED THE PARK GATE LARSAN STOPPED US
NEVERTHELESS HE INSISTED ON ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE STATION AT EPINAY IN CROSSING THE PARK HE SAID TO ME FREDERIC IS REALLY VERY CLEVER AND HAS NOT BELIED HIS REPUTATION
NOW SAID OBERON TO THIS LITTLE SPRITE FETCH ME THE FLOWER CALLED LOVE IN IDLENESS THE JUICE OF THAT LITTLE PURPLE FLOWER LAID ON THE EYES OF THOSE WHO SLEEP WILL MAKE THEM
SAID THE KING WHAT JEALOUS OBERON
THE DAY AFTER THE GLANDIER CRIME NEVER MOVE A STEP WITHOUT ONE
SO NOW DEMETRIUS AND LYSANDER WERE BOTH FOLLOWING HER THROUGH THE WOOD AND IT WAS HERMIA'S TURN TO FOLLOW HER LOVER AS HELENA HAD DONE BEFORE
I IMMEDIATELY ASKED YES HE SAID SHE WILL BE SAVED PERHAPS SHE MUST BE SAVED HE DID NOT ADD OR IT WILL BE MY DEATH BUT I FELT THAT THE PHRASE TREMBLED ON HIS PALE LIPS
DO YOU KNOW HOW HE CAME TO FIND DADDY JACQUES'S BOOTS NEAR THE SPOT WHERE WE NOTICED THE TRACES OF THE NEAT BOOTS AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE ROUGH ONES THERE WAS A SQUARE HOLE FRESHLY MADE IN THE MOIST GROUND
AND MONSIEUR DARZAC ON HIS KNEES BY HER PILLOW I GUESSED THAT EACH HAD DRAWN DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS FROM WHAT THEY HAD SEEN IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT THE SCENE HAD STRONGLY IMPRESSED ROULETABILLE IN FAVOUR OF MONSIEUR ROBERT DARZAC
HE WAS OF MIDDLE HEIGHT AND WELL BUILT WITH A GENERAL BEARING ELEGANT AND GENTLEMANLY THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT HIM OF THE VULGAR POLICEMAN IN HIS WAY HE WAS AN ARTIST AND ONE FELT THAT HE HAD A HIGH OPINION OF HIMSELF
ONE OF A PARTY OF PLAYERS WHO HAD COME OUT INTO THE WOOD TO REHEARSE THEIR PLAY THIS CLOWN HAD MET WITH PUCK WHO HAD CLAPPED AN ASS'S HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS SO THAT IT LOOKED AS IF IT GREW THERE
KEPT STATE IN ANOTHER AND THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS TROUBLE WAS A LITTLE INDIAN BOY WHOM TITANIA HAD TAKEN TO BE ONE OF HER FOLLOWERS OBERON WANTED THE CHILD TO FOLLOW HIM
AFTER YOU PRAY SOMEBODY WAS OVERHEAD SPEAKING EXCHANGING COURTESIES WHAT WAS MY ASTONISHMENT TO SEE ON THE SLIPPERY COLUMN OF THE TREE TWO HUMAN FORMS APPEAR AND QUIETLY SLIP DOWN TO THE GROUND
FORSAKEN PERHAPS FOR ME AGAINST HER WILL RETURNED IN AN UNHAPPY MOMENT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND WANTING TIME TO THINK OF WHAT SHE DID SHE MADE HERSELF A PARTY TO HIS TREACHERY BY CONCEALING IT LAST NIGHT SHE SAW HIM IN THE INTERVIEW WE WITNESSED IT WAS WRONG
HEAR ME KINDLY I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE TO YOU MY DARLING A CONFESSION FATHER I HAVE WANDERED FROM THE TRUTH AND LOST MYSELF MY CHILD SAID CALEB WITH A PITIABLE EXPRESSION IN HIS BEWILDERED FACE
THE BLIND GIRL GREATLY AGITATED ROSE AND LED THE CARRIER'S LITTLE WIFE ASIDE THOSE PRESENTS THAT I TOOK SUCH CARE OF THAT CAME ALMOST AT MY WISH AND WERE SO DEARLY WELCOME TO ME SHE SAID TREMBLING WHERE DID THEY COME FROM DID YOU SEND THEM
POOR CHILD POOR DOT I NOT TO FIND IT OUT WHO HAVE SEEN HER EYES FILL WITH TEARS WHEN SUCH A MARRIAGE AS OUR OWN WAS SPOKEN OF I WHO HAVE SEEN THE SECRET TREMBLING ON HER LIPS A HUNDRED TIMES AND NEVER SUSPECTED IT TILL LAST NIGHT POOR GIRL
BUT AS SHE HAS BEEN THERE ONCE THIS MORNING PERHAPS YOU'LL EXCUSE HER TACKLETON LOOKED HARD AT THE THIRD FINGER AND TOOK A LITTLE PIECE OF SILVER PAPER APPARENTLY CONTAINING A RING FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET MISS SLOWBOY SAID TACKLETON
HEAVEN BLESS HER SAID THE CARRIER FOR THE CHEERFUL CONSTANCY WITH WHICH SHE HAS TRIED TO KEEP THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FROM ME
HER DELIGHT AND PRIDE IN THE REPLY AND HER RENEWED EMBRACE OF DOT WERE CHARMING TO BEHOLD MORE CHANGES THAN YOU THINK FOR MAY HAPPEN THOUGH MY DEAR SAID DOT CHANGES FOR THE BETTER I MEAN CHANGES FOR GREAT JOY TO SOME OF US
THIS IS THE END OF WHAT YOU SHOWED ME NOW IT'S OVER
THERE'S MANY MEN I CAN'T COMPARE WITH WHO NEVER COULD HAVE LOVED MY LITTLE DOT LIKE ME I THINK HE PAUSED AND SOFTLY BEAT THE GROUND A SHORT TIME WITH HIS FOOT BEFORE RESUMING I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT THOUGH I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER I SHOULD MAKE HER A KIND HUSBAND
I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT MY DEAR I'M AFRAID RETURNED CALEB IF I COULD HAVE MADE HER BETTER THAN SHE WAS
I HOPED SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORCED INTO IT AGAINST HER OWN DESIRE AND RECOLLECTION IT WOULD BE SMALL COMFORT BUT IT WOULD BE SOME I THOUGHT AND ON I CAME THAT I MIGHT HAVE THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH OBSERVING FREELY FOR MYSELF AND JUDGING FOR MYSELF WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION ON THE ONE HAND
SEE WHERE HE STANDS BEFORE YOU HEALTHY AND STRONG YOUR OWN DEAR SON YOUR OWN DEAR LIVING LOVING BROTHER BERTHA ALL HONOUR TO THE LITTLE CREATURE FOR HER TRANSPORTS
NEVER LET THEM SAY I AM BLIND AGAIN THERE'S NOT A FURROW IN HIS FACE THERE'S NOT A HAIR UPON HIS HEAD THAT SHALL BE FORGOTTEN IN MY PRAYERS AND THANKS TO HEAVEN
ANSWERED TACKLETON AS IF I MEANT IT VERY MUCH AS IF YOU MEANT IT I SAT UPON THAT HEARTH LAST NIGHT ALL NIGHT EXCLAIMED THE CARRIER ON THE SPOT WHERE SHE HAS OFTEN SAT BESIDE ME WITH HER SWEET FACE LOOKING INTO MINE
THE CARRIER SET HIS GRIP UPON THE COLLAR OF THE TOY MERCHANT AND SHOOK HIM LIKE A REED LISTEN TO ME HE SAID AND TAKE CARE THAT YOU HEAR ME RIGHT LISTEN TO ME DO I SPEAK PLAINLY VERY PLAINLY INDEED
WHAT I WANT MOST TO TELL YOU I HAVE KEPT TO THE LAST MY DEAR GOOD GENEROUS JOHN WHEN WE WERE TALKING THE OTHER NIGHT ABOUT THE CRICKET I HAD IT ON MY LIPS TO SAY
OR PRESENTING MY OWN INFLUENCE IF I HAD ANY BEFORE HER ON THE OTHER I DRESSED MYSELF UNLIKE MYSELF YOU KNOW HOW AND WAITED ON THE ROAD YOU KNOW WHERE YOU HAD NO SUSPICION OF ME NEITHER HAD HAD SHE
WHY DID YOU EVER FILL MY HEART SO FULL AND THEN COME IN LIKE DEATH AND TEAR AWAY THE OBJECTS OF MY LOVE O HEAVEN HOW BLIND I AM HOW HELPLESS AND ALONE HER AFFLICTED FATHER HUNG HIS HEAD AND OFFERED NO REPLY BUT IN HIS PENITENCE AND SORROW
AND NOW SHE UTTERED A WILD CRY OF UNCONTROLLABLE DELIGHT AND RUNNING UP TO CALEB PUT HER HANDS UPON HIS EYES AS A YOUNG MAN RUSHED INTO THE ROOM AND FLINGING AWAY HIS HAT INTO THE AIR CAME SWEEPING DOWN UPON THEM IS IT OVER
SHE PANTED COMING NEARER NEARER VERY CLOSE AND NOW YOU HEAR THEM STOPPING AT THE GARDEN GATE
NOTHING COULD IMPROVE HER BERTHA
AND WHEN SHE KNEW HIS PURPOSE SHE ADVISED HIM BY ALL MEANS TO KEEP HIS SECRET CLOSE FOR HIS OLD FRIEND JOHN PEERYBINGLE WAS MUCH TOO OPEN IN HIS NATURE AND TOO CLUMSY IN ALL ARTIFICE BEING A CLUMSY MAN IN GENERAL SAID DOT HALF LAUGHING AND HALF CRYING
THAT YOU HAD SEEN ME WALKING IN THE GALLERY WITH EDWARD
BUT IT'S BEST FOR HER THAT SHE SHOULD BE UNDECEIVED AND I MUST BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES AS I DESERVE MARY SAID BERTHA WHERE IS YOUR HAND AH HERE IT IS HERE IT IS PRESSING IT TO HER LIPS WITH A SMILE AND DRAWING IT THROUGH HER ARM
ALL HONOUR TO THE HEARTINESS WITH WHICH SHE MET THE SUNBURNT SAILOR FELLOW WITH HIS DARK STREAMING HAIR HALF WAY AND NEVER TURNED HER ROSY LITTLE MOUTH ASIDE BUT SUFFERED HIM TO KISS IT FREELY AND TO PRESS HER TO HIS BOUNDING HEART
I TOLD HER YOU WOULD NOT BE THERE MUM WHISPERED CALEB I HEARD AS MUCH LAST NIGHT BUT BLESS YOU SAID THE LITTLE MAN TAKING HER TENDERLY BY BOTH HANDS
YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHEN I LEFT HERE A BOY SAID EDWARD I WAS IN LOVE AND MY LOVE WAS RETURNED SHE WAS A VERY YOUNG GIRL WHO PERHAPS YOU MAY TELL ME
IT'S QUITE CORRECT MISSUS EDWARD PLUMMER I INFER THAT'S THE NAME RETURNED THE BRIDEGROOM AH I SHOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN YOU SIR SAID TACKLETON SCRUTINISING HIS FACE NARROWLY AND MAKING A LOW BOW
SAID POOR CALEB HE'S GONE NOTHING IS GONE SHE ANSWERED DEAREST FATHER NO
AND CAME TO THINK IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT WE SHOULD BE MARRIED AND IN THE END IT CAME ABOUT AND WE WERE MARRIED
AND PERHAPS KNOW HER VALUE BETTER THAN ANOTHER
TO SHUT HER UP FROM DAY TO DAY IN MY DULL HOUSE AND KEEP MY TEDIOUS COMPANY
SHE HAD BEEN BUT A SHORT TIME IN THIS PASSION OF REGRET WHEN THE CRICKET ON THE HEARTH UNHEARD BY ALL BUT HER BEGAN TO CHIRP NOT MERRILY BUT IN A LOW FAINT SORROWING WAY IT WAS SO MOURNFUL THAT HER TEARS BEGAN TO FLOW
AND SHE WILL LIVE SO I AM SURE IF I SHOULD DIE I MAY PERHAPS WHILE SHE IS STILL YOUNG I HAVE LOST SOME COURAGE IN A FEW HOURS SHE'LL FIND THAT I REMEMBERED HER
BUT LOOKING NOW TOWARDS THE LITTLE HAY MAKER IN THE MOORISH MEADOW SHE SAW THAT THE CLOCK WAS WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF STRIKING
WELL A SORT OF HOSPITAL WHERE I HAPPENED TO BE BLAIR RAN OFF TO HIS BROTHERS AND I SUPPOSE I MIGHT SAY MASON WAS HIT BECAUSE HE DIED THERE DOES THAT SUIT YOU NO IT DOESN'T WHY DID BLAIR RUN AND WHO HIT THE OTHER FELLOW
THE POEMS WERE AS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS OF VARIED EXCELLENCE AS THE YOUTHFUL SPEAKERS TRIED TO PUT OLD TRUTHS INTO NEW WORDS AND MADE THEM FORCEFUL BY THE ENTHUSIASM OF THEIR EARNEST FACES AND FRESH VOICES
THAT ASLAUGA'S KNIGHT HAD FOUGHT HIS LAST FIGHT AND WAS AT PEACE STUFFY BECAME AN ALDERMAN AND DIED SUDDENLY OF APOPLEXY AFTER A PUBLIC DINNER DOLLY WAS A SOCIETY MAN OF MARK TILL HE LOST HIS MONEY
GOOD BYE THEN HURRIED BACK TO HIS ROOM FEELING AS IF IT WERE THE PRISON CELL AGAIN WITH NO GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN'S BLUE TO COMFORT HIM THIS ABRUPT CARESS AND DEPARTURE RATHER STARTLED BESS FOR SHE FELT WITH A GIRL'S QUICK INSTINCT
UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT BUT HE WAS REALLY EXPECTING TO SET OFF SOON
YOU HAVE SPOKEN OF MY SECRET MEDDLING AND MY INTERFERING IGNORANCE AND MY FALSE ASSENT I HAVE NEVER EXPRESSED MYSELF IN THAT WAY TO YOU AND I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO APOLOGIZE YOU SPOKE OF ITS BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE WITH ME
TAKEN ABACK AT THIS DISAPPOINTING DISCOVERY BUT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO GIVE UP YET AND BEGAN AGAIN WHAT MISCHIEF DAN NEVER YOU MIND BOYS SHOULDN'T BOTHER BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW AWFULLY
FAR FROM IT HE ADORED GOOD CLOTHES AND OWING TO HIS GREAT HEIGHT ALREADY REVELLED IN A DRESS SUIT BEQUEATHED HIM BY A DANDY FRIEND THE EFFECT WAS VERY FUNNY BUT HE WOULD WEAR IT IN SPITE OF THE JEERS OF HIS MATES
IT WAS EARNEST SENSIBLE AND SO INSPIRING THAT SHE LEFT THE STAGE IN A STORM OF APPLAUSE THE GOOD FELLOWS BEING AS MUCH FIRED BY HER STIRRING APPEAL TO MARCH SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AS IF SHE HAD CHANTED THE MARSEILLAISE THEN AND THERE
IT IS A TERRIBLE MOMENT IN YOUNG LIVES WHEN THE CLOSENESS OF LOVE'S BOND HAS TURNED TO THIS POWER OF GALLING IN SPITE OF ROSAMOND'S SELF CONTROL A TEAR FELL SILENTLY AND ROLLED OVER HER LIPS SHE STILL SAID NOTHING
LATER HOWEVER THE MOUSTACHE APPEARED AND MANY STRANGERS FIRMLY BELIEVED
WHILE ROSAMOND RESEATED HERSELF AND WATCHED HIM AS HE OPENED THE LETTER SHE HAD EXPECTED HIM TO BE SURPRISED WHILE LYDGATE'S EYES GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER THE BRIEF LETTER
A PRUDENT SISTER DETAINED HIM HOWEVER AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS ABLE TO LISTEN WITH COMPOSURE TO THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS THEY WERE WORTH LISTENING TO FOR MISTER BHAER SPOKE LIKE A FATHER TO THE CHILDREN WHOM HE WAS DISMISSING TO THE BATTLE OF LIFE
THAT I HAVE EXPRESSED A DECIDED WISH AND YOU HAVE SEEMED TO ASSENT YET AFTER THAT YOU HAVE SECRETLY DISOBEYED MY WISH IN THAT WAY I CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO TRUST TO THERE WOULD BE SOME HOPE FOR US IF YOU WOULD ADMIT THIS
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ROWS AND THINGS THEY LIKED THE MINE BUSINESS HEROES AND THAT SORT
THAT REWARDED MANY A MUTUAL SACRIFICE MISTER LAURIE AND HIS WIFE WERE ON THE RECEPTION COMMITTEE AND THEIR LOVELY HOUSE WAS OVERFLOWING MISSUS MEG WITH DAISY AND JO AS AIDES WAS IN DEMAND AMONG THE GIRLS HELPING ON BELATED TOILETTES
WONDERING HOW THE BOYISH FACE WOULD CHANGE IF THE TRUTH WERE SUDDENLY TOLD HIM I'LL SWEAR IT ON LOCKED FISTS IF YOU LIKE I KNOW IT WAS JOLLY AND I'M ACHING TO HEAR YOU ARE AS CURIOUS AS A GIRL MORE THAN SOME
TAKING ON A DRY WHITENESS WITH NOSTRILS AND LIPS QUIVERING HE TOSSED DOWN THE LETTER BEFORE HER AND SAID VIOLENTLY IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ENDURE LIFE WITH YOU IF YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ACTING SECRETLY ACTING IN OPPOSITION TO ME AND HIDING YOUR ACTIONS
THE HANDS THAT TURNED THE PAGES OF WISE BOOKS ALSO POSSESSED THE SKILL TO DECORATE THE HALL WITH FLOWERS EYES TIRED WITH STUDY SHONE WITH HOSPITABLE WARMTH ON THE ASSEMBLING GUESTS AND UNDER THE WHITE MUSLINS BEAT HEARTS AS FULL OF AMBITION HOPE AND COURAGE
AND ROARS WHISTLES COMMANDS AND GROANS WERE HEARD FROM THE DEN WHEREIN THE LION RAGED AND THE LAMB PATIENTLY TOILED MISSUS JO BORE IT TILL BOOTS WERE HURLED AND A RAIN OF HAIR BRUSHES SET IN THEN FEARING FOR THE SAFETY OF HER ELDEST
AND ROSAMOND AWAITING AN ANSWER TO HER WINNING APPEAL WAS EVERY DAY DISAPPOINTED LYDGATE IN TOTAL IGNORANCE OF HER EXPECTATIONS WAS SEEING THE BILLS COME IN AND FEELING THAT DOVER'S USE OF HIS ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER CREDITORS WAS IMMINENT
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO SEE THE EAGER INTEREST WITH WHICH THE GIRLS LISTENED TO SOME BRILLIANT BROTHER STUDENT AND APPLAUDED HIM WITH A RUSTLE AS OF WIND OVER A BED OF FLOWERS IT WAS STILL MORE SIGNIFICANT AND PLEASANT TO WATCH THE YOUNG MEN'S FACES
AND AT ONCE DEVISED A VERY SIMPLE MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM DANGER MISTER LAURIE WAS GOING TO WASHINGTON ON DAN'S BEHALF AND WAS DELIGHTED TO TAKE HIS FAMILY WITH HIM WHEN THE IDEA WAS CARELESSLY SUGGESTED SO THE CONSPIRACY SUCCEEDED FINELY AND MISSUS JO WENT HOME
SHE SPOKE AND WEPT WITH THAT GENTLENESS WHICH MAKES SUCH WORDS AND TEARS OMNIPOTENT OVER A LOVING HEARTED MAN LYDGATE DREW HIS CHAIR NEAR TO HERS AND PRESSED HER DELICATE HEAD AGAINST HIS CHEEK WITH HIS POWERFUL TENDER HAND
I DON'T MEAN ROBBING MAILS AND KLU KLUXING AND THAT SORT OF THING BUT DEFENDING THE SETTLERS OR HANGING SOME SCAMP OR EVEN SHOOTING A FEW AS A FELLOW MUST SOMETIMES IN SELF DEFENCE AH HA I'VE HIT IT I SEE NEEDN'T SPEAK
FEELING MORE LIKE A TRAITOR THAN EVER SHE EXPECTED AN EXPLOSION BUT DAN TOOK THE NEWS SO QUIETLY IT WAS PLAIN THAT HE CHERISHED NO HOPE AND MISSUS AMY WAS SURE HER ROMANTIC SISTER HAD BEEN MISTAKEN IF SHE HAD SEEN DAN'S FACE
AND DON'T ASK FOR THE MOST RIDICULOUS HEAD GEAR IN THE KNOWN WORLD DENIED THIS NOBLE BADGE OF MANHOOD TED SOOTHED HIS WOUNDED SOUL BY APPEARING IN COLLARS OF AN AMAZING HEIGHT AND STIFFNESS
THAT WILL DO ROB WAS DEVOTED ON THESE TRYING OCCASIONS HIS OWN TOILET BEING DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY ITS SPEED SIMPLICITY AND NEATNESS TED WAS USUALLY IN A FRENZY BEFORE HE WAS SUITED
HE WENT TO VISIT AN OLD FRIEND IN PENNSYLVANIA REMOTE FROM RAILROADS AND TELEGRAPHS THE GOULD POOL HAD ACQUIRED CONTROL OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GOLD AND DROVE THE PRICE UPWARD RAPIDLY FROM ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR TOWARD THEIR GOAL OF TWO HUNDRED
ON ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK TO GET OUR LUNCH BEFORE KEEPING THE APPOINTMENTS WHICH WERE USUALLY MADE FOR TWO O'CLOCK
AND MUCH TROUBLE TO THE BROKER HE CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE AND SAID NOW YOUNG MAN I WANT TO CLOSE UP THE MATTER OF YOUR INVENTIONS HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD RECEIVE
AS BUSINESS COLLEAGUES OF THE DAYS OF WHICH WE NOW WRITE
HE MUST HAVE BEEN HOWEVER A MAN OF ORIGINALITY AS EVIDENCED BY HIS ATTEMPT TO AGE WHISKEY BY ELECTRICITY
THAN THIS WHICH THUS PLACED AN ILL CLAD UNKEMPT HALF STARVED EAGER LAD IN A POSITION OF SUCH RESPONSIBILITY IN DAYS
SO THAT AT EVERY MINUTE THOUSANDS OF MILES APART BROKERS INVESTORS AND GAMBLERS MAY LEARN THE EXACT CONDITIONS THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH FACILITIES IS TO BE ADMIRED RATHER THAN DEPLORED
HE REPORTED THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS I GAVE A SUPPER TO SOME OF MY MEN TO CELEBRATE THIS ONLY TO BE TOLD TWO DAYS AFTERWARD
TO VISIT THE CITY FIVE OR SIX TIMES WITHIN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT PERIOD
SOUGHT THE MORE SECLUDED HEADQUARTERS OF THE POOL FORCES A FRIEND OF MINE WAS AN OPERATOR WHO WORKED IN THE OFFICE OF BELDEN AND COMPANY SIXTY BROADWAY WHICH WERE HEADQUARTERS FOR FISK MISTER GOULD WAS UP TOWN IN THE ERIE OFFICES IN THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE
AND THE LONG ROOM DEVOTED TO ONE BUT THE LEADING OBJECT OF SPECULATION THE GOLD ROOM WAS THE VERY FOCUS OF ALL THE FINANCIAL AND GAMBLING ACTIVITY OF THE TIME AND ITS QUOTATIONS GOVERNED TRADE AND COMMERCE
OR WORM ON THE TYPE WHEEL SHAFT UNTIL IT MET A PIN AT THE END OF THE WORM THUS OBSTRUCTING THE SHAFT AND LEAVING THE TYPE WHEELS AT THE ZERO POINT UNTIL RELEASED BY THE PRINTING LEVER
THIS WAS SUCH A VIOLENT JUMP FROM ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE THAT IT RATHER PARALYZED ME FOR A WHILE I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO MUCH TO BE LASTING
AND THE DELAY CONFUSION AND MISTAKES SOON SUGGESTED TO DOCTOR LAWS THE DESIRABILITY OF HAVING A NUMBER OF INDICATORS AT SUCH SCATTERED POINTS OPERATED BY A MASTER TRANSMITTER
HAD PRODUCED SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN GAS IN TORRENTS
FURNISHING THE MONEY AND THE WELL KNOWN UNIVERSAL TICKER IN WIDE SPREAD USE IN ITS DAY WAS ONE RESULT MISTER EDISON GIVES A GRAPHIC PICTURE OF THE STARTLING EFFECT ON HIS FORTUNES I MADE A GREAT MANY INVENTIONS
UNTIL THE STREET GOT WIND OF THE GAME THERE WAS SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY WITH THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE WHICH I COULD NOT MAKE OUT BUT I HEARD MESSAGES THAT OPENED MY EYES AS TO THE RAMIFICATIONS OF WALL STREET
HE SEIZED HIS OPPORTUNITY
I OBTAINED A LOAN OF MONEY AMOUNTING TO EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BUILD A PECULIAR KIND OF DUPLEX TELEGRAPH FOR SENDING TWO MESSAGES OVER A SINGLE WIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY
LOCATED NEAR THE STATION OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD IN JERSEY CITY EVERY NIGHT I LEFT FOR ELIZABETH ON THE ONE A M TRAIN THEN WALKED HALF A MILE TO MISTER POPE'S HOUSE AND UP AT SIX A M FOR BREAKFAST TO CATCH THE SEVEN A M TRAIN
AND IS HERE REPRODUCED IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ADVERTISEMENT ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE TELEGRAPHER AND APPEARING FREQUENTLY WAS NOT PAID FOR AT FULL RATES AS THE PUBLISHER MISTER J N ASHLEY BECAME A PARTNER IN THE FIRM
THAT OF THE TWENTY ONE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL SOCIETY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR EIGHT HAVE BEEN INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH EDISON NAMELY NORVIN GREEN AND F L POPE
THE NEXT MAN ADJACENT WAS JOHN KRUESI AFTERWARD ENGINEER OF THE GREAT GENERAL ELECTRIC WORKS AT SCHENECTADY A THIRD WAS SCHUCKERT
WHEN JAMES BROWN OF BROWN BROTHERS AND COMPANY BROKE THE CORNER BY SELLING FIVE MILLION GOLD ALL PAYMENTS WERE REPUDIATED BY SMITH GOULD AND MARTIN BUT THEY CONTINUED TO RECEIVE CHECKS AT BELDEN AND COMPANY'S FOR SOME TIME
IN NEW YORK THE TWO GREAT STOCK EXCHANGES HAVE DEEMED IT NECESSARY TO OWN AND OPERATE A STOCK TICKER SERVICE FOR THE SOLE BENEFIT OF THEIR MEMBERS AND DOWN TO THE PRESENT MOMENT THE PROCESS OF IMPROVEMENT HAS GONE ON
THIS WAS INTERPRETED TO MEAN FIRST THE PARTS WILL FIT SECOND THEY WILL ALMOST FIT THIRD THEY DO NOT FIT AND CAN'T BE MADE TO FIT FOOTNOTE TWO THIS I INVENTED AS WELL T A E
AND WAS DIVIDED AND MARKED IN EIGHTHS IT GEARED INTO A UNIT DRUM
EACH SHAFT WITH ITS DIAL WAS PROVIDED WITH TWO RATCHET WHEELS ONE THE REVERSE OF THE OTHER ONE WAS USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPELLING LEVER
SAYS THEIR QUONDAM MASTER
AS TO THE RELATIONS OF THAT TIME MISTER POPE REMARKS THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO CONCERNS RESULTED IN CONSOLIDATION
BUT SEEING THEIR INADEQUACY DOCTOR S S LAWS VICE PRESIDENT AND ACTUAL PRESIDING OFFICER OF THE GOLD EXCHANGE DEVISED AND INTRODUCED
IF ANY OPERATOR TRIED TO RECEIVE FROM BORST HE COULDN'T DO IT SO BORST AND I ALWAYS WORKED TOGETHER BORST DID LESS TALKING THAN ANY OPERATOR I EVER KNEW NEVER HAVING SEEN HIM
AND NOT ALTOGETHER A SLEEPING ONE WHEN IT CAME TO A DIVISION OF PROFITS WHICH AT TIMES WERE CONSIDERABLE IN ORDER TO BE NEARER HIS NEW FRIEND EDISON BOARDED WITH POPE AT ELIZABETH NEW JERSEY FOR SOME TIME
WE TOOK THE DOWNTOWN FERRY ACROSS THE HUDSON
THAT THE MODERN STOCK TICKER HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MAKING OR LOSING OF FORTUNES THERE WERE REGULAR DAILY STOCK MARKET REPORTS IN LONDON NEWSPAPERS IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND NEW YORK SOON FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE
TO WHOM THE NOISE WAS THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE OF THE MECHANISM MISTER CALLAHAN REMOVED THE TWO DIALS AND SUBSTITUTING TYPE WHEELS TURNED THE MOVEMENTS FACE TO FACE SO THAT EACH TYPE WHEEL COULD IMPRINT ITS CHARACTERS UPON A PAPER TAPE IN TWO LINES
SINKING ON THE STONES SHE TOOK SOME IN EACH HAND AND CLENCHED THEM UP AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE GROUND THEM
YOU BAD MAN RETURNED MY AUNT WITH GREAT EMOTION HOW CAN YOU USE ME SO BUT WHY DO I ASK IT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW WEAK I AM
SHE IS IN A STATE OF FRENZY I WHISPERED TO HIM SHE WILL SPEAK DIFFERENTLY IN A LITTLE TIME I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID IN ANSWER HE MADE SOME MOTION WITH HIS MOUTH AND SEEMED TO THINK HE HAD SPOKEN
A SYLLABLE THAT COMES OUT OF MY LIPS IT WOULD BE A BURNING SHAME UPON YOU EVEN NOW IF SHE AND I EXCHANGED A WORD I DON'T COMPLAIN
THE LIGHT IN THE PASSAGE WAS OBSCURED FOR A MOMENT AND MY AUNT CAME OUT SHE WAS AGITATED
FOR NOT HAVING DRIVEN HER AWAY FROM THE DOOR I WANT TO SAY NOTHING FOR MYSELF SHE SAID AFTER A FEW MOMENTS I AM BAD I AM LOST I HAVE NO HOPE AT ALL BUT TELL HIM SIR SHE HAD SHRUNK AWAY FROM HIM
LOOKING INTENTLY AT IT ALL THE WAY HERE I HAD SUPPOSED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO SOME HOUSE INDEED I HAD VAGUELY ENTERTAINED THE HOPE THAT THE HOUSE MIGHT BE IN SOME WAY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOST GIRL
AND WHEN SHE WAS SILENT GENTLY RAISED HER MARTHA SAID MISTER PEGGOTTY GOD FORBID AS I SHOULD JUDGE YOU FORBID AS I OF ALL MEN SHOULD DO THAT MY GIRL
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SHE LOOKED NEITHER AT HIM NOR AT ME BUT STOOD IN A HUMBLE ATTITUDE
AS IF THERE WAS SOME HEALING VIRTUE IN HIM WENT AWAY ALONG THE DESOLATE ROAD SHE HAD BEEN ILL PROBABLY FOR A LONG TIME I OBSERVED UPON THAT CLOSER OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVATION THAT SHE WAS WORN AND HAGGARD
AS IF IT WERE THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN IT AFTER STOOPING TO PUT THE BOTTLE ON THE GROUND HE LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS AND LOOKED ABOUT
MAYBE YOU CAN GUESS THAT IF YOU'D HAD SUCH A FRIEND YOU'D HAVE GOT INTO A WAY OF BEING FOND OF HIM IN COURSE OF TIME
I HAVE TOLD YOU SO HAVING GOT IT WHY DO YOU GIVE ME THE PAIN OF LOOKING AT YOU FOR ANOTHER MOMENT AND SEEING WHAT YOU HAVE BECOME I HAVE BECOME SHABBY ENOUGH IF YOU MEAN THAT HE SAID I LEAD THE LIFE OF AN OWL
BUT I COULD NOT PREVAIL UPON HER TO ACCEPT ANY MONEY NOR COULD I EXACT ANY PROMISE FROM HER THAT SHE WOULD DO SO AT ANOTHER TIME I REPRESENTED TO HER THAT MISTER PEGGOTTY COULD NOT BE CALLED FOR ONE IN HIS CONDITION POOR
I NEVER SAW IN ANY PAINTING OR REALITY HORROR AND COMPASSION SO IMPRESSIVELY BLENDED HE SHOOK AS IF HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN AND HIS HAND I TOUCHED IT WITH MY OWN FOR HIS APPEARANCE ALARMED ME WAS DEADLY COLD
HOW CAN I GO ON AS I AM A SOLITARY CURSE TO MYSELF A LIVING DISGRACE TO EVERYONE I COME NEAR SUDDENLY SHE TURNED TO MY COMPANION STAMP UPON ME KILL ME WHEN SHE WAS YOUR PRIDE
I BELIEVE BECAME AN ADVENTURER A GAMBLER AND A CHEAT WHAT HE IS NOW YOU SEE BUT HE WAS A FINE LOOKING MAN WHEN I MARRIED HIM SAID MY AUNT WITH AN ECHO OF HER OLD PRIDE AND ADMIRATION IN HER TONE AND I BELIEVED HIM
UNTIL AT LENGTH HE SAID IS THIS ALL YOU MEAN TO GIVE ME THEN IT IS ALL I CAN GIVE YOU SAID MY AUNT
IF SHE WERE NOT TRUE TO IT MIGHT THE
WE FOLLOWED HER AT A SHORT DISTANCE OUR WAY LYING IN THE SAME DIRECTION UNTIL WE CAME BACK INTO THE LIGHTED AND POPULOUS STREETS I HAD SUCH IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE IN HER DECLARATION THAT I THEN PUT IT TO MISTER PEGGOTTY WHETHER IT WOULD NOT SEEM
THERE WAS A NEW AND THOUGHTFUL COMPASSION IN HIM THAT I WAS AT NO LOSS TO INTERPRET IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN I ARRIVED AT HOME I HAD REACHED MY OWN GATE AND WAS STANDING LISTENING FOR THE DEEP BELL OF SAINT PAUL'S THE SOUND OF WHICH I THOUGHT HAD BEEN BORNE TOWARDS ME
I SAT IN SILENT AMAZEMENT BETSEY TROTWOOD
THE GIRL WE HAD FOLLOWED STRAYED DOWN TO THE RIVER'S BRINK AND STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THIS NIGHT PICTURE LONELY AND STILL LOOKING AT THE WATER THERE WERE SOME BOATS AND BARGES ASTRAND IN THE MUD
EXCEPT IN THE TONE OF THOSE WORDS I CAN'T KEEP AWAY FROM IT I CAN'T FORGET IT
TOLD SOME MONEY INTO HIS HAND I HEARD IT CHINK WHAT'S THE USE OF THIS HE DEMANDED I CAN SPARE NO MORE RETURNED MY AUNT THEN I CAN'T GO SAID HE HERE YOU MAY TAKE IT BACK
CRYING AND MOANING IN A LITTLE WHILE SHE SAT AMONG THE STONES HOLDING HER WRETCHED HEAD WITH BOTH HER HANDS OH THE RIVER SHE CRIED PASSIONATELY OH THE RIVER HUSH HUSH SAID I CALM YOURSELF
IT SEEMS TOO BOLD IF ANY GOOD SHOULD COME OF ME I MIGHT BEGIN TO HOPE FOR NOTHING BUT HARM HAS EVER COME OF MY DEEDS YET I AM TO BE TRUSTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG WHILE
THE CAUSE OF HER FLIGHT IS TOO WELL UNDERSTOOD I SAID YOU ARE INNOCENT OF ANY PART IN IT WE THOROUGHLY BELIEVE WE KNOW
DEPENDING ON HER OWN RESOURCES SHOCKED US BOTH SHE CONTINUED STEADFAST IN THIS PARTICULAR HIS INFLUENCE UPON HER WAS EQUALLY POWERLESS WITH MINE SHE GRATEFULLY THANKED HIM BUT REMAINED INEXORABLE
THE PIERCING AGONY OF HER REMORSE AND GRIEF WAS TERRIBLE TO HAVE DIED WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH WHAT CAN I SAY I WOULD HAVE LIVED SHE CRIED I WOULD HAVE LIVED TO BE OLD IN THE WRETCHED STREETS AND TO WANDER ABOUT
IF YOU DON'T FEEL TOO HARD TO ME TO DO IT THAT I NEVER WAS IN
A SLUGGISH DITCH DEPOSITED ITS MUD AT THE PRISON WALLS COARSE GRASS AND RANK WEEDS STRAGGLED OVER ALL THE MARSHY LAND IN THE VICINITY
FOR THIS GLOOMY END TO HER DETERMINED WALK AND THE WAY IN WHICH SHE STOOD ALMOST WITHIN THE CAVERNOUS SHADOW OF THE IRON BRIDGE LOOKING AT THE LIGHTS CROOKEDLY REFLECTED IN THE STRONG TIDE INSPIRED A DREAD WITHIN ME
HE REPEATED STEADILY FUR SHE'S MORE DEAR TO ME NOW MARTHA THAN SHE WAS DEAR AFORE
BUT AT THE TIME I EXPECTED FROM SUCH A TITLE SOMETHING IN THE WAY OF A BELATED MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM OR LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST I WAS FULLY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE A COMEDY AND AS THE BOOK EVEN THEN WAS RARE
IF ONE READER OF THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT WERE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH HE WOULD SAY THAT TO HIM AT LEAST THE OTHER THE GENUINE ORIENTAL TALES APPEAR THE IMITATION AND NOT A VERY GOOD IMITATION
AS I SAID BEFORE THE IMP OF MISCHIEF SEEMED TO BE IN OLD MISTER POSSUM'S HEAD THAT MORNING FOR HE BEGAN TO PLAY TRICKS ON HIS NEIGHBORS AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF BED HE HID OLD KING BEAR'S BREAKFAST WHILE THE LATTER HAD HIS HEAD TURNED
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO RUN AWAY WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED BY HIS ENEMIES THEY ALWAYS TRIED TO RUN AWAY SO DID EVERYBODY ELSE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE EXCEPTING UNC BILLY POSSUM THERE MUST BE A REASON SAID PETER GRAVELY
IN YOUTH YOU SHELTERED ME YES SIR THAT'S THE KIND I AM HE STOOD UP SAUNTERED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AND TOOK A SMALL OBJECT FROM THE TOP OF THE BOOKCASE FOND OF THESE PINK CRYSTALS
TOUCHED THE GREAT LION WITH THE BROKEN SAPPHIRE HAIR OF GARRAVEEN OR AGAIN HOW ON THE BLACK COAST OF THE ENCHANTED SEA WANDERING BY MOONLIGHT HE FOUND THE SACRED LILY AND TORE IT UP AND LO
IN WHAT IS UTTERLY OUTSIDE THE LIMITS OF EXPERIENCE IT BELONGS TO THAT INFANCY OF THE WORLD WHEN THE HAPPY GUILELESS HUMAN BEING STILL HOLDS THAT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A FLOWER TO BE PLUCKED A LAMP TO BE RUBBED
THAT THE RECKONING BETWEEN HIMSELF AND UNDINE SHOULD BE SETTLED IN DOLLARS AND CENTS SEEMED THE LAST BITTEREST SATIRE ON HIS DREAMS HE FELT HIMSELF MISERABLY DIMINISHED BY THE SMALLNESS OF WHAT HAD FILLED HIS WORLD
THERE BROKE THE SHOUT OF A SMALL BOY RACING ACROSS A SUBURBAN LAWN WHEN I PICK HIM UP TO NIGHT HE'LL BE MINE FOR GOOD RALPH THOUGHT AS MOFFATT SUMMED UP THERE'S THE WHOLE SCHEME IN A NUT SHELL
FOR HIS LEGS ARE LONG AND MADE FOR RUNNING BUT STRIPED CHIPMUNK WAS NOT FAR BEHIND JOHNNY CHUCK TOOK HIS TIME FOR HE KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS BESIDES HE WAS SO FAT THAT TO RUN MADE HIM PUFF AND BLOW
WHICH BACON WOULD HAVE WRITTEN IF HE HAD BEEN SO PLAGUILY OCCUPIED THAN THAT IT IS EXCELLENT IN QUALITY AND OF THE FINEST LITERARY FLAVOUR THE ORDINARY SMALL COLLECTION OF RARITIES HAS NO ROOM FOR THREE VOLUME NOVELS
HEARD OF A SOFT THING THAT WON'T WAIT I PRESUME
AND SOMETIMES HE GOT THEM INTO TROUBLE BUT WHEN HE DID HE ALWAYS MANAGED TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY UNTIL THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THEIR ANGER ONE MORNING THE VERY IMP OF MISCHIEF SEEMED TO GET INTO OLD MISTER POSSUM'S HEAD
MOFFATT TWISTED HIS MOUSTACHE BETWEEN TWO PLUMP SQUARE TIPPED FINGERS WITH A LITTLE BLACK GROWTH ON THEIR LOWER JOINTS I DON'T SUPPOSE HE REMARKED THERE'S A SANE MAN BETWEEN HERE AND SAN FRANCISCO WHO ISN'T CONSUMED BY THAT YEARNING
RALPH FELT THE COLOUR IN HIS FACE WELL YOU SEE I SHALL NEED AS MUCH AS FIFTY HER HANDS FLEW TOGETHER JOYFULLY BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO LET ME HELP OH I'M SO GLAD SO GLAD
HIS RETURN FROM EUROPE HAD BEEN ANXIOUSLY AWAITED HIS UNREADINESS TO TESTIFY CAUSTICALLY CRITICIZED THEN AT LAST HE HAD ARRIVED HAD GONE ON TO WASHINGTON AND HAD APPARENTLY HAD NOTHING TO TELL
PORTRAYED BY A POWERFUL ARTIST CAST ON HER THE SATISFIED EYE OF PROPRIETORSHIP RALPH SWEPT FORWARD ON THE BLAST OF HIS EXCITEMENT FELT AS IN A DREAM THE FRIVOLOUS PERVERSITY OF HER RECEIVING HIM IN SUCH A SETTING
WHO HAD TO TEACH US TO APPRECIATE DE QUINCEY AND PRAED BEFORE WE KNEW THE VALUE OF THOSE MEN YET IS THERE MUCH TO DO HAD GEORGE MEREDITH BEEN A FRENCHMAN WHAT MONOGRAPHS HAD ERE THIS BEEN CALLED FORTH BY HIS WORK
IT WAS SUCH A GOOD JOKE THAT OLD MISTER POSSUM TRIED IT ON MISTER WOLF AND MISTER FISHER AND MISTER FOX IN FACT HE HUNTED UP EVERY ONE HE COULD THINK OF AND SENT THEM TO CALL ON OLD KING BEAR AND WITHOUT REALLY TELLING THEM SO
AND NOW THAT I HOLD IT MAY ITS MODEST VERMILION COVER SHINE ALWAYS LIKE A LAMP UPON MY SHELVES IT IS NOT FICTION TO A BIBLIOPHILE IT IS WORTHY OF ALL THE HONOUR DONE TO VERSE
THEN WHENEVER OLD KING BEAR CAME NEAR THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS HIDDEN OLD MISTER POSSUM WOULD HIDE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE OLD KING BEAR WAS HUNGRY AND HE WORKED HIMSELF UP INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE
WHEN HE SAW THEM COMING HE REALIZED THAT WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT WAS A JOKE HAD BECOME NO LONGER A LAUGHING MATTER FOR HIM HE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO RUN SO HE SCRAMBLED UP A TREE HE QUITE FORGOT THAT MISTER PANTHER AND MISTER LYNX COULD CLIMB JUST AS FAST AS HE
THE GNOMES OF POPE THE FAYS AND
INSTEAD OF IN THEIR USUAL QUIET CORNER BUT THERE WAS NO ROOM IN HIS MIND FOR ANYTHING BUT THE CRY THAT BROKE FROM HIM I BELIEVE I'VE DONE IT HE SAT DOWN AND EXPLAINED TO HER BY WHAT MEANS TRYING AS BEST HE COULD
IT HAS SEEMED TO ME THAT THE ONLY WAY TO TELL AN ARABIAN STORY WAS BY IMITATING THE STYLE AND MANNER OF THE ORIENTAL STORY TELLERS BUT SUCH AN ATTEMPT WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR NOT
ALL KINDS OF EM THERE'S ALWAYS OTHER FELLOWS AFTER THEM MOFFATT'S SMILE WAS PLAYFUL WELL I'D GO CONSIDERABLY OUT OF MY WAY TO DO YOU A GOOD TURN BECAUSE YOU DID ME ONE WHEN I NEEDED IT MIGHTY BAD
MY MY BUT HIS TEMPER DID BOIL OVER IT CERTAINLY DID AND IF HE COULD HAVE LAID HANDS ON OLD MISTER POSSUM THAT MINUTE IT SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM BUT OLD MISTER POSSUM WAS MIGHTY SPRY
AND OFTEN WOULD SHE SAY SHOULD THE POOR BABE HAVE ANY FEELINGS CORRESPONDENT WITH ITS MOTHER'S IT WILL HAVE NO WANT WHILE UNDER YOUR PROTECTION ALAS SHE HAD NO SOONER QUITTED IT HERSELF THAN SHE WAS PLUNGED INTO A GULPH OF MISERY
HOW RAPID WAS THEN MY EVELINA'S PROGRESS THROUGH THOSE REGIONS OF FANCY AND PASSION WHITHER HER NEW GUIDE CONDUCTED HER SHE SAW LORD ORVILLE AT A BALL AND HE WAS THE MOST AMIABLE OF MEN
THE LONG AND MUTUAL ANIMOSITY BETWEEN HER AND SIR JOHN WILL MAKE HER INTERFERENCE MERELY PRODUCTIVE OF DEBATES AND ILL WILL
BUT SHE HAS TOO LITTLE WEALTH TO BE SOUGHT WITH PROPRIETY BY MEN OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD CONSIDER MADAM THE PECULIAR CRUELTY OF HER SITUATION ONLY CHILD OF A WEALTHY BARONET
BUT ALSO TO JUSTIFY THE CONDUCT WHICH HAS RESULTED FROM THEM IT NOW REMAINS TO SPEAK OF THE TIME TO COME AND HERE INDEED I AM SENSIBLE OF DIFFICULTIES WHICH I ALMOST DESPAIR OF SURMOUNTING ACCORDING TO MY WISHES
SHE LOVED ME AS HER FATHER NOR WAS MISSUS VILLARS LESS VALUED BY HER WHILE TO ME SHE BECAME SO DEAR THAT HER LOSS WAS LITTLE LESS AFFLICTING THAN THAT WHICH I HAVE SINCE SUSTAINED OF MISSUS VILLARS HERSELF
SHE IS AT ONCE UNEDUCATED AND UNPRINCIPLED UNGENTLE IN TEMPER AND UNAMIABLE IN HER MANNERS I HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT SHE HAS PERSUADED HERSELF TO HARBOUR AN AVERSION FOR ME
WITH ANY PROSPECT OF SUCCESS TO SUCH A WOMAN AS MADAME DUVAL HER CHARACTER AND THE VIOLENCE OF HER DISPOSITION INTIMIDATE ME FROM MAKING THE ATTEMPT SHE IS TOO IGNORANT FOR INSTRUCTION TOO OBSTINATE FOR INTREATY
THE HELPLESS AND INNOCENT OFFSPRING WHO BORN IN SO MUCH SORROW SEEMED ENTITLED TO ALL THE COMPASSIONATE TENDERNESS OF PITY FOR MANY YEARS THE NAME ALONE OF THAT MAN ACCIDENTALLY SPOKEN IN MY HEARING
A METHOD WHICH WILL SUBJECT HER TO ALL THE IMPERTINENCE OF CURIOSITY THE SNEERS OF CONJECTURE AND THE STINGS OF RIDICULE AND FOR WHAT THE ATTAINMENT OF WEALTH WHICH SHE DOES NOT WANT AND THE GRATIFICATION OF VANITY WHICH SHE DOES NOT FEEL
WHICH IT IS EXTREMELY PAINFUL TO ME NOT TO CONCUR WITH YET I AM SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR GOODNESS THAT I PRESUME TO HOPE IT WOULD NOT BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO OFFER SUCH ARGUMENTS AS MIGHT LEAD YOU TO THINK WITH ME
AND FORBEARING TO MAKE ANY CLAIM UPON SIR JOHN BELMONT COULD I FEEL AN AFFECTION THE MOST PATERNAL FOR THIS POOR SUFFERER AND NOT ABOMINATE HER DESTROYER COULD I WISH TO DELIVER TO HIM WHO HAD SO BASELY BETRAYED THE MOTHER
WHO WAS FIRMLY PERSUADED OF HER APPROACHING DISSOLUTION FREQUENTLY AND EARNESTLY BESOUGHT ME THAT IF HER INFANT WAS A FEMALE I WOULD NOT ABANDON HER TO THE DIRECTION OF A MAN SO WHOLLY UNFIT TO TAKE THE CHARGE OF HER EDUCATION
YOU WILL START AT THE MENTION OF HIS NAME YOU WILL TREMBLE EVERY WORD YOU READ
YOUR PEACE OF MIND IS AT STAKE AND EVERY CHANCE FOR YOUR FUTURE HAPPINESS MAY DEPEND UPON THE CONDUCT OF THE PRESENT MOMENT HITHERTO I HAVE FORBORNE TO SPEAK WITH YOU UPON THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL CONCERNS THE STATE OF YOUR HEART
I PROPOSED NAY ATTEMPTED A SIMILAR PLAN BUT THEN ALL ASSISTANCE AND ENCOURAGEMENT WAS DENIED HOW CRUEL TO THE REMEMBRANCE I BEAR OF HER WOES IS THIS TARDY RESENTMENT OF MADAME DUVAL
BERRY HILL MAY SECOND YOUR LETTER MADAM HAS OPENED A SOURCE OF ANXIETY
AT THAT PERIOD OF HER LIFE WE PARTED
THE BEST BELOVED OF MY HEART AND HER MEMORY SO LONG AS MY OWN HOLDS I SHALL LOVE MOURN AND HONOUR ON THE FATAL DAY THAT HER GENTLE SOUL LEFT ITS MANSION AND NOT MANY HOURS ERE SHE CEASED TO BREATHE
WHOSE PERSON SHE HAS NEVER SEEN WHOSE CHARACTER SHE HAS REASON TO ABHOR AND WHOSE NAME SHE IS FORBIDDEN TO CLAIM ENTITLED AS SHE IS TO LAWFULLY INHERIT HIS FORTUNE AND ESTATE IS THERE ANY PROBABILITY THAT HE WILL PROPERLY OWN HER
I HOPE UPON THIS SUBJECT NEVER MORE TO HEAR IT MENTIONED WITH MADAME DUVAL ALL PLEAS OF DELICACY WOULD BE INEFFECTUAL HER SCHEME MUST BE OPPOSED BY ARGUMENTS BETTER SUITED TO HER UNDERSTANDING
FOR NOTWITHSTANDING HE HAD BEEN TOO WEAK TO RESIST THE ALLUREMENTS OF BEAUTY WHICH NATURE THOUGH A NIGGARD TO HER OF EVERY OTHER BOON HAD WITH A LAVISH HAND BESTOWED ON HIS WIFE YET HE WAS A YOUNG MAN OF EXCELLENT CHARACTER
WHICH SHE HAD EARLY BEEN TAUGHT TO PRIZE ABOVE ALL OTHER THINGS HAD RECEIVED A MORTAL WOUND THEREFORE TO CLEAR HER OWN HONOUR AND TO SECURE FROM BLEMISH THE BIRTH OF HER CHILD WAS ALL THE GOOD WHICH FORTUNE HAD RESERVED HERSELF THE POWER OF BESTOWING
I WAS IN A PERPETUAL CONFLICT BETWEEN THE DESIRE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE JUSTICE DONE HER AND THE APPREHENSION THAT WHILE I IMPROVED HER FORTUNE I SHOULD ENDANGER HER MIND HOWEVER AS HER CHARACTER BEGAN TO BE FORMED
AND SUPPORTED HER FROM HER EARLIEST INFANCY TO HER SIXTEENTH YEAR AND SO AMPLY HAS SHE REPAID MY CARE AND AFFECTION
AND DENIED THAT THEY HAD EVER BEEN UNITED SHE FLEW TO ME FOR PROTECTION WITH WHAT MIXED TRANSPORTS OF JOY AND ANGUISH DID I AGAIN SEE HER BY MY ADVICE SHE ENDEAVOURED TO PROCURE PROOFS OF HER MARRIAGE BUT IN VAIN
YOUNG ANIMATED ENTIRELY OFF YOUR GUARD AND THOUGHTLESS OF CONSEQUENCES IMAGINATION TOOK THE REINS AND REASON SLOW PACED THOUGH SURE FOOTED
TO INDUCE MADAME DUVAL TO SETTLE HER OWN UPON THEMSELVES IN THIS HOWEVER THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE MISTAKEN FOR LITTLE MINDS HAVE EVER A PROPENSITY TO BESTOW THEIR WEALTH UPON THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY IN AFFLUENCE AND THEREFORE
HIS SOCIETY IS DEATH TO YOUR FUTURE TRANQUILLITY BELIEVE ME MY BELOVED CHILD MY HEART ACHES FOR YOUR SUFFERING WHILE IT DICTATES ITS NECESSITY
MISS LAMAR'S HOME HERE IN THE CITY
THE NEGATIVE WE TOOK FROM THE CAMERAS AT TARRYTOWN HE EXPLAINED ALSO A PRINT FROM EACH ROLL READY TO RUN I'VE BEEN HOLDING THIS AS EVIDENCE MISTER KENNEDY WANTED ME TO BRING IT WITH ME TO DAY HE'S WAITING FOR US AT THE LABORATORY I REMARKED HE'LL STRAIGHTEN EVERYTHING UP IN A HURRY WON'T HE
IT WAS NOT SARCASM BUT ASSUMED
OF COURSE I WANT TO DO ANYTHING I CAN UPON ARRIVAL AT THE STUDIO WE DETECTED THIS TIME ALL THE SIGNS OF A COMPLETE DEMORALIZATION THE DEATH OF WERNER
I SAW THAT KENNEDY SINGLED OUT MARILYN GOOD MORNING SHE SAID CHEERFULLY BUT WITH EFFORT IT WAS OBVIOUS SHE HAD SPENT A NERVOUS NIGHT THERE WERE CIRCLES UNDER HER EYES ILL CONCEALED BY THE SMALL QUANTITY OF COSMETIC SHE USED HER HANDS SHIFTING CONSTANTLY
OF COURSE WE CAN ONLY DRAW CONCLUSIONS WHO WERE THE VARIOUS CALLERS JACK GORDON HER FIANCE MERLE SHIRLEY SHIRLEY ADMITTED IT WHEN YOU QUESTIONED HIM MANTON
A FEW MOMENTS LATER I UNDERSTOOD WHAT KENNEDY WAS UP TO AS HE FINISHED WITH EACH VICTIM HE TOOK SOME BIT OF COTTON OR GAUZE WITH WHICH HE HAD WIPED THEIR CUTS ENOUGH BLOOD TO SERVE HIM IN CHEMICAL ANALYSIS AND HANDED IT TO MACKAY
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WHIMPERED A BIT GORDON WAS DISPOSED TO SWEAR CHEERFULLY ALTHOUGH A POINT OF GLASS HAD PENETRATED DEEP IN HIS SHOULDER AND ANOTHER PIECE HAD GASHED HIM ACROSS THE FOREHEAD FINALLY KENNEDY WAS THROUGH HE PACKED THE LITTLE ENVELOPES IN THE BAG
LISTEN KENNEDY I SUGGESTED SUPPOSE I GO OUT BY MYSELF AND SEE IF I CAN LOCATE SHIRLEY OR MARILYN EVERYONE ELSE IS RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU CAN AT THAT INSTANT A DEAFENING EXPLOSION SHOOK THE STUDIO AND EVERY BUILDING ABOUT THE QUADRANGLE
THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME HE LOCKED IT AS HE STRAIGHTENED HIS EYES NARROWED
I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT JUST YET HE PAUSED DELIBERATELY YOU SEE HE LIED I HAVE YET TO MAKE MY ANALYSIS BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A CLUE TO THE THAT TOWEL HE RAISED HIS VOICE AS THOUGH IN ELATION
WE'RE FISHING IN THE DARK ABSOLUTELY SO FAR WE HAVEN'T A SINGLE BASIC FACT ON WHICH TO BUILD ANY STRUCTURE OF HYPOTHESIS WE MUST GO ON FISHING I EXPECT YOU TO DIG UP ALL THE FACTS ABOUT THESE PEOPLE
YOU THINK THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY SUSPECTS NO BUT THEY WERE INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH MISS LAMAR IN HER DAILY LIFE AND THEY ARE THE TWO WE HAVE LEARNED THE LEAST ABOUT OH I WAS DISAPPOINTED
IN NO INSTANCE COULD THE INTEREST OF A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF GUILT PHELPS ENTERED THE STUDIO FROM THE DOOR TO THE DRESSING ROOMS DISDAINING TO JOIN THE OTHER GROUP HE APPROACHED US TO ASK THE CAUSE FOR THE EXCITEMENT
I LED THE WAY TO THE DOOR AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT I KNOW THAT KENNEDY WILL RESORT TO ALMOST ANYTHING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FINGERED THE PACKAGE UNDER HIS ARM
NOW WALTER HE EXCLAIMED SOBERING I PICKED UP THE TRAVELING BAG AND TOGETHER WE STROLLED TOWARD THE BALLROOM SET THERE MOST OF THE PLAYERS WERE GATHERED ALREADY IN MAKE UP AND EVENING CLOTHES OF A FANCIER SORT EVEN THAN THOSE DEMANDED FOR THE BANQUET
AND WERE HOLDING HER COLORED MAID I HURRIED DOWN TO HEADQUARTERS AND QUESTIONED THE GIRL YES TO ME IT SOUNDED PROMISING THE NEGRESS DIDN'T KNOW A THING SO FAR AS THE CRIME IS CONCERNED KENNEDY WENT ON BUT I GAINED QUITE AN INSIGHT INTO THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE STAR
WHY SHOULD THE FINDING OF THAT CIGARETTE CASE BE A CAUSE FOR SUSPICION AT ALL THAT'S WHAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BEFORE ORDINARILY IT WOULDN'T BE BUT THOSE OPEN INNER DOORS THE ABSENCE OF THE MAN IN CHARGE
IT'S GETTING MORE AND MORE COMPLICATED WALTER HE EXCLAIMED
TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE HE WAS IN HERE JUST ABOUT A WEEK AGO I WAS SITTING IN THE GRILL EATING AN AFTER THEATER SUPPER WHEN I HEARD THE MOST TERRIBLE RACKET HE AND EMERY PHELPS THE BANKER YOU KNOW
THE VAULTS HE CALLED TO THE MEN WHO SEEMED DISPOSED TO LINGER ABOUT FOR GOD'S SAKE GET BUSY THE NEXT INSTANT HE WAS GONE HIMSELF
WHILE GORDON HAD GLARED AT STELLA
AND WHEN YOU QUESTIONED MANTON WE WERE PASSING RIGHT BY ALL OF THEM ANY ONE COULD HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF THE SNAKE FILM KENNEDY FROWNED I BELIEVE YOU'RE RIGHT WALTER
ENID GASPED
OF HANDLING THE ACTION AND HE'S OVER IN THE THICK OF IT IT'S WORSE THAN BEDLAM AND BETTER THAN A CHAPLIN COMEDY I WAS COMPELLED TO SMILE ALTHOUGH I KNEW THAT THIS WAS NOT UNCOMMON IN PICTURE STUDIOS
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT WE INTERRUPTED AN ATTEMPT NOT ONLY TO SEARCH FOR THE PARTICULAR DAMAGING PIECES OF FILM BUT PERHAPS TO DESTROY THE WHOLE IF SOME ONE ACTED BETWEEN THE TIME I ASKED MANTON ABOUT THE SNAKE FILM AND THE MOMENT WE ARRIVED IN THE BASEMENT TO GET IT
GORDON FIRST HAD COME UP HIMSELF QUIETLY PLEADING WITH STELLA
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM ONLY STEPS LEADING UP AND DOWN AND THE OPEN DOOR TO A HUGE DEVELOPING ROOM RETURNING TO THE YARD WE CAUGHT A GESTURE FROM THE CHAUFFEUR OF A CAR STANDING NEAR BY AND RECOGNIZED MC GROARTY
IN SILENCE AND TO OUR SURPRISE FOUND THAT THEY WERE CLOSED AND THAT EVEN THE BOY WAS GONE NOW THE CELLAR AS A WHOLE PROBABLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF FIRE PROTECTION ON A LARGER SCALE WAS DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE UNITS OF THE BUILDINGS ABOVE
DON'T FORGET THAT THIS WAS A COLD BLOODED CALCULATED CRIME I'M NOT ELIMINATING MANTON YET BUT UNTIL WE FIND SOME TANGIBLE EVIDENCE OF TROUBLE BETWEEN STELLA AND HIMSELF WE CAN HARDLY ASSUME HE WOULD KILL THE GIRL
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO HELP ME TO STAY WITH JAMESON AND MYSELF ALL DAY KENNEDY ASKED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AFTER PERHAPS A MILE OF SILENCE SURELY IT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING YOU'D ALLOW ME TO DO I HAVE NO AUTHORITY DOWN HERE THOUGH I UNDERSTAND BUT THE POLICE OR
NO ONE HAD BEEN HURT SERIOUSLY ALREADY A PROPERTY BOY WAS AT KENNEDY'S SIDE WITH A HUGE BOX MARKED PROMINENTLY WITH THE RED CROSS INSIDE WAS EVERYTHING NECESSARY AND KENNEDY STARTED TO BIND UP THE WOUNDS WITH ALL THE SKILL OF A PROFESSIONAL PHYSICIAN
SHE WOULDN'T SAY ANY MORE OVER THE PHONE BUT I WAS HUGELY CURIOUS
THROUGH THE STREETS CROWDED BY VISITORS DOWN THE HARBOUR WHERE THE FISHERMEN CONGREGATE ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND OVER THE HEAD BETWEEN SEA AND SKY PEOPLE BOWING TO THEM RESPECTFULLY RIGIDLY FREEZINGLY PEOPLE NUDGING AND WHISPERING AND LOOKING THEIR WAY
HE THOUGHT PHILIP WAS COMING AGAIN AS HE HAD SO OFTEN SEEN HIM COME IN HIS GLORY IN HIS GREATNESS IN HIS TRIUMPH WHERE IS HE HE ROARED HE'S HERE THEY ANSWERED AND THEN PHILIP WAS BROUGHT UP THE PATH IN THE ARMS OF FOUR BEARERS HIS HEAD HANGING ASIDE
HE WAS SAYING TO HIMSELF BOLDLY SINCE EITHER WAY THERE IS TROUBLE I'LL DO AS I SAID LAST NIGHT I'LL LEAVE HEAVEN TO DECIDE WHETHER I'M TO BE A GREAT MAN OR A LITTLE MAN AND DECIDE FOR MYSELF WHETHER I'M TO BE A TRUE MAN OR A HAPPY MAN
OH GOD WHAT END COULD COME OF SUCH AN ABJECT LIFE BUT THAT BEGINNING BY BEING UNHAPPY THEY SHOULD DESCEND TO BEING BAD AS WELL WHAT A FUSS YOU ARE MAKING OF THINGS SAID THE VOICE AGAIN BUT MORE LOUDLY
HE THOUGHT OF HIS AUNT AND HOW HURT SHE HAD BEEN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT OF HIS UNCLE AND HOW HE HAD SNUBBED AND THEN SLAVERED OVER HIM OF THE GOVERNOR AND HOW STRANGE THE INTEREST HE HAD SHOWN IN HIM
IN HIS BLURRED VISION CONFUSED FORMS FLOATED ABOUT HIM AH MY TOOLS HE THOUGHT AND PICKED UP THE MALLET AND TWO OF THE CHISELS HE WAS SITTING WITH THESE IN HIS HANDS WHEN HIS EYES FELL ON THE OTHER CANDLESTICK THE ONE IN WHICH THE CANDLE HAD GONE OUT
THE GOLDEN THREADS THAT HAD BOUND HIM TO LIFE WERE BROKEN WHEN POVERTY HAD COME HE HAD MET IT WITHOUT REPINING WHEN DEATH HAD SEEMED TO COME HE HAD BORNE UP AGAINST IT BRAVELY BUT WIFELESS FRIENDLESS DECEIVED WHERE HE HAD LOVED
AND THE DESIRE OF YOUR HEART BOTH THE DEEMSTER SHIP AND KATE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT IF HE MARRIED KATE THE GOVERNOR WOULD NOT RECOMMEND HIM AS DEEMSTER
NOT TO HAVE FELT ANGER HE MUST HAVE BEEN LESS THAN A MAN OR MORE HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE CHILD HAD BEEN TO HIM HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT WAS WHEN IT CAME AND AGAIN WHEN HE THOUGHT ITS MOTHER WAS DEAD HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT WAS WHEN DEATH FROWNED ON IT
SHE MIGHT BE THEIR SUPERIOR IN EDUCATION CERTAINLY IN ALL TRUE MANNERS AND IN NATURAL GRACE AND BEAUTY IN SWEETNESS AND CHARM THEIR MISTRESS BEYOND A DREAM OF COMPARISON BUT THEY WOULD NEVER FORGET THAT SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A COUNTRY INNKEEPER
NOTHING MATTERED WITH THE MALLET HANGING FROM HIS HAND HE CONTINUED TO SIT IN THE DRIFTING MOONLIGHT FEELING AS IF EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD HAD BEEN SHIVERED TO ATOMS HIS TWO IDOLS HAD BEEN SCATTERED AT ONE BLOW HIS WIFE AND HIS FRIEND
AND EVERY LITTLE COBBLE IN THE RICKETY PYRAMID EVEN FROM THE DAUGHTER OF THE INNKEEPER IN THE TOWN WOULD LOOK DOWN ON HER AS FROM A THRONE HE COULD SEE THEM LEAVING THEIR CARDS AT HIS DOOR AND DRIVING HURRIEDLY OFF THEY MUST DO THAT MUCH
HE WOULD BE TABOO TO HALF THE LIFE OF THE ISLAND IN PUBLIC AN OFFICIAL IN PRIVATE A RECLUSE AN ICY PICTURE ROSE BEFORE HIS MIND'S EYE OF THE WOMAN WHO WOULD BE HIS WIFE IN HER RELATIONS WITH THE LADIES HE HAD JUST LEFT
HIS DIGNITY FROM HIS MASTER BUT HIS RETICENCE HE HAD CREATED FOR HIMSELF BEING A THING BEYOND NATURE IN CREATURE OR MAN HIS PROPER NAME WAS COTTIER HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN AS JEMY LORD
THAN FEAR OF THE OLD FASHIONED MANX CONVENTIONS TO PREVENT ANY RECOMMENDATION OF THE HUSBAND OF THE WRONG WOMAN AT ONE MOMENT A VAGUE MEMORY ROSE BEFORE PHILIP AS HE CROSSED THE FIELDS OF THE LUNCH AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE
OTHERS WERE BEARING LANTERNS AND A FEW HELD HIGH OVER THEIR HEADS THE TORCHES WHICH FISHERMEN USE WHEN THEY ARE HAULING THE WHITE NETS AT NIGHT WHO'S THERE CRIED PETE IN A VOICE THAT WAS LIKE A HOWL YOUR FRIEND SAID SOMEBODY
HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT WAS IT WAS THE CRACKED MEDALLION OF HIS FATHER HE COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOK AT IT UNLOCKING A CHEST HE BURIED IT AT THE BOTTOM UNDER A PILE OF WINTER CLOTHING THIS RECALLED A POSSESSION YET MORE PAINFUL
THE FIRST ONE THAT HE HAD PUT INTO PHILIP'S HAND THE SECOND THAT HE HAD READ TO HIM THE THIRD THAT PHILIP HAD WRITTEN TO HIS DICTATION THE LITTLE FORGERIES TO KEEP HER POOR NAME SWEET THE LITTLE INVENTIONS TO MAKE HIS STORY PLAUSIBLE THE LITTLE LIES OF LOVE
PAT PUT PAT PUT HOW LONG HE WORKED HE NEVER KNEW THERE ARE MOMENTS WHICH ARE NOT TO BE MEASURED AS TIME IN THE UNCERTAIN HANDLING OF THE CHISEL AND THE IRREGULAR BEAT OF THE MALLET SOMETHING GAVE WAY THERE WAS A HARSH SOUND LIKE A GROAN
AND WHAT IT HAD BEEN SINCE DEATH PASSED IT BY FLESH OF HIS FLESH BLOOD OF HIS BLOOD BONE OF HIS BONE HEART OF HIS HEART NOT HIS MERELY BUT HIMSELF
I'LL TAKE MY HEART IN MY HAND AND GO RIGHT FORWARD IN THIS TEMPER HE RETURNED TO HIS CHAMBERS THE ROOMS FRONTED TO ATHOL STREET BUT BACKED ON TO THE CHURCHYARD OF SAINT GEORGE'S THEY WERE QUIET AND NOT OVERLOOKED
AND SHAKING AT EVERY STEP HIS FACE WHITE AS THE WIG ABOVE IT AND HIS GOWN TRAILING ALONG THE EARTH THERE WAS A SUDDEN CALM AND PETE DROPPED BACK IN AWE AND HORROR A BOLT OUT OF HEAVEN SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN AT HIS FEET
AT THE VERY GATES OF HEAVEN HE HAS LIED TO ME LIKE HELL THE HOUR OF JUSTICE HAS STRUCK AND THUS I PAY HIM AND THUS AND THUS BUT THE POWER OF WORDS WAS LOST IN THE DRUNKENNESS OF HIS RAGE
HIS VOICE STARTLED AND HIS WORDS HORRIFIED HIM TO WIPE OUT BOTH IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS HE FILLED HIS GLASS TO THE BRIM AND LIFTED IT UP RISING AT THE SAME TIME LOOKING ACROSS THE TABLE
A CRACK LIKE A FLASH OF FORKED LIGHTNING HAD SHOT ACROSS THE FACE OF THE STONE HE HAD SPLIT IT IN HALF ITS GREAT PIECES FELL TO THE FLOOR ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THE STONE HAD BEEN USELESS IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW HE THOUGHT
THEN THERE WERE THE HIGH WALLS OF CUSTOM AND PREJUDICE TO SURMOUNT PHILIP REMEMBERED THE GARDEN PARTY AND SAW THAT THEY COULD NEVER BE SURMOUNTED THE DEEMSTER WHO SLAPPED THE CONVENTIONS IN THE FACE WOULD SUFFER FOR IT
HE'D BETTER NOT HA STIRRED A KETTLE O SOUR BROTH THE BUCOLIC MIND DOES NOT READILY APPREHEND THE REFINEMENTS OF GOOD TASTE BUT THE TOAST COULD NOT BE REJECTED AND WHEN IT HAD BEEN DRUNK ARTHUR SAID I THANK YOU BOTH FOR MY GRANDFATHER AND MYSELF
HE LOOKED NEITHER AWKWARD NOR EMBARRASSED BUT STOOD IN HIS USUAL FIRM UPRIGHT ATTITUDE WITH HIS HEAD THROWN A LITTLE BACKWARD AND HIS HANDS PERFECTLY STILL IN THAT ROUGH DIGNITY WHICH IS PECULIAR TO INTELLIGENT HONEST WELL BUILT WORKMEN
DINNER TIME WHEN ADAM HEARD THAT HE WAS TO DINE UPSTAIRS WITH THE LARGE TENANTS HE FELT RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE IDEA OF BEING EXALTED IN THIS WAY ABOVE HIS MOTHER AND SETH WHO WERE TO DINE IN THE CLOISTERS BELOW
HEREUPON A GLORIOUS SHOUTING A RAPPING A JINGLING A CLATTERING AND A SHOUTING WITH PLENTIFUL DA CAPO PLEASANTER THAN A STRAIN OF SUBLIMEST MUSIC IN THE EARS THAT RECEIVE SUCH A TRIBUTE FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND HE HAS JUST BEEN EXPRESSING A FEELING WHICH I SHARE VERY HEARTILY AND I WOULD NOT WILLINGLY OMIT THE OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING SO THAT FEELING IS HIS VALUE AND RESPECT FOR ADAM BEDE
PEEH SAID MISTER CRAIG IT'S NOT TO BE NAMED BY SIDE O THE SCOTCH TUNES I'VE NEVER CARED ABOUT SINGING MYSELF I'VE HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO A MAN THAT'S GOT THE NAMES AND THE NATUR O PLANTS IN'S HEAD ISNA LIKELY TO KEEP A HOLLOW PLACE T HOLD TUNES IN
BUT I'VE THE MORE REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU CAPTAIN AND TO YOU MISTER IRWINE AND TO ALL MY FRIENDS HERE WHO'VE DRUNK MY HEALTH AND WISHED ME WELL
OH DEAR AUNT I WISH YOU'D SPEAK TO TOTTY SHE KEEPS PUTTING HER LEGS UP SO AND MESSING MY FROCK WHAT'S THE MATTER WI THE CHILD SHE CAN NIVER PLEASE YOU SAID THE MOTHER
AND FIND MY BIRTHDAY ALE GOOD MISTER IRWINE AND I ARE COME TO TASTE IT WITH YOU AND I AM SURE WE SHALL ALL LIKE ANYTHING THE BETTER THAT THE RECTOR SHARES WITH US ALL EYES WERE NOW TURNED ON MISTER POYSER WHO
PEOPLE IN A HIGH STATION ARE OF COURSE MORE THOUGHT OF AND TALKED ABOUT AND HAVE THEIR VIRTUES MORE PRAISED THAN THOSE WHOSE LIVES ARE PASSED IN HUMBLE EVERYDAY WORK BUT EVERY SENSIBLE MAN KNOWS HOW NECESSARY THAT HUMBLE EVERYDAY WORK IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO US THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE WELL
AS WE'RE ALL O ONE MIND ABOUT OUR YOUNG SQUIRE WE'VE PRETTY NIGH ALL ON US KNOWN YOU WHEN YOU WAR A LITTLE UN AN WE'VE NIVER KNOWN ANYTHING ON YOU BUT WHAT WAS GOOD AN HONORABLE YOU SPEAK FAIR
THAT HE WAS FIXED ON AS THE SECOND BROADEST MAN MARTIN POYSER THE YOUNGER AS THE BROADEST WAS TO BE PRESIDENT AND MISTER CASSON AS NEXT BROADEST WAS TO BE VICE OWING TO THIS ARRANGEMENT ADAM BEING OF COURSE
AND THE NEXT BROADEST MUST SIT AT BOTTOM THIS HAPPY MODE OF SETTLING THE DISPUTE PRODUCED MUCH LAUGHTER A SMALLER JOKE WOULD HAVE SUFFICED FOR THAT MISTER CASSON HOWEVER DID NOT FEEL IT COMPATIBLE WITH HIS DIGNITY AND SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE TO JOIN IN THE LAUGH UNTIL IT TURNED OUT
FOR TOTTY'S EYES WERE TOO BUSY IN STARING AT THE LARGE DISHES TO SEE WHERE THE PLUM PUDDING WAS FOR HER TO RETAIN ANY CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER LEGS HETTY GOT QUITE OUT OF PATIENCE AND AT LAST WITH A FROWN AND POUT AND GATHERING TEARS SHE SAID
AN WE'RE JOYFUL WHEN WE LOOK FORRARD TO YOUR BEING OUR LANDLORD FOR WE B'LIEVE YOU MEAN TO DO RIGHT BY EVERYBODY AN ULL MAKE NO MAN'S BREAD BITTER TO HIM IF YOU CAN HELP IT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN AN THAT'S WHAT WE ALL MEAN
I HAVE INTERESTED MYSELF A GOOD DEAL IN SUCH MATTERS AND LEARNED AS MUCH ABOUT THEM AS MY OPPORTUNITIES HAVE ALLOWED
IT HAS LONG BEEN MY WISH THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WOODS ON THE ESTATE WHICH HAPPEN TO BE VERY VALUABLE NOT ONLY BECAUSE I THINK SO HIGHLY OF HIS CHARACTER BUT BECAUSE HE HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKILL WHICH FIT HIM FOR THE PLACE AND I AM HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS MY GRANDFATHER'S WISH TOO
AND IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT IF HETTY HAD BEEN PLAIN SHE WOULD HAVE LOOKED VERY UGLY AND UNAMIABLE AT THAT MOMENT AND NO ONE'S MORAL JUDGMENT UPON HER WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE LEAST BEGUILED BUT REALLY THERE WAS SOMETHING QUITE CHARMING IN HER PETTISHNESS
AND NOW THERE IS ONE MORE THING I WISH TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY SHARE MY PLEASURE ABOUT IT AS I HOPE AND BELIEVE YOU WILL I THINK THERE CAN BE NO MAN HERE WHO HAS NOT A RESPECT AND SOME OF YOU I AM SURE HAVE A VERY HIGH REGARD FOR MY FRIEND ADAM BEDE
I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING HIS TUTOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAVE NATURALLY HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF KNOWING HIM INTIMATELY WHICH CANNOT HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE ELSE WHO IS PRESENT AND I HAVE SOME PRIDE AS WELL AS PLEASURE IN ASSURING YOU THAT I SHARE YOUR HIGH HOPES CONCERNING HIM
THE HEALTH DRINKING WHEN THE DINNER WAS OVER AND THE FIRST DRAUGHTS FROM THE GREAT CASK OF BIRTHDAY ALE WERE BROUGHT UP ROOM WAS MADE FOR THE BROAD MISTER POYSER AT THE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND TWO CHAIRS WERE PLACED AT THE HEAD
AND MOTHER ULL BE FINE AND JOYFUL ABOUT IT LET'S GO AND TELL HER ADAM WAS NOT THE ONLY GUEST INVITED TO COME UPSTAIRS ON OTHER GROUNDS THAN THE AMOUNT HE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RENT ROLL THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE TWO PARISHES WHO DERIVED DIGNITY FROM THEIR FUNCTIONS
BUT THERE IS A STILL OLDER FRIEND OF MINE THAN ADAM BEDE PRESENT AND I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT IT IS MISTER IRWINE I'M SURE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT WE MUST DRINK NO OTHER PERSON'S HEALTH UNTIL WE HAVE DRUNK HIS I KNOW YOU HAVE ALL REASON TO LOVE HIM
IT LOOKED SO MUCH MORE LIKE INNOCENT DISTRESS THAN ILL HUMOUR AND THE SEVERE ADAM FELT NO MOVEMENT OF DISAPPROBATION HE ONLY FELT A SORT OF AMUSED PITY AS IF HE HAD SEEN A KITTEN SETTING UP ITS BACK OR A LITTLE BIRD WITH ITS FEATHERS RUFFLED
HE WAS A GOOD DEAL MOVED BY THIS PUBLIC TRIBUTE VERY NATURALLY FOR HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL HIS LITTLE WORLD AND IT WAS UNITING TO DO HIM HONOUR BUT HE FELT NO SHYNESS ABOUT SPEAKING NOT BEING TROUBLED WITH SMALL VANITY OR LACK OF WORDS
SHOULD SIT AT TOP O THE TABLE I WASN'T BUTLER FIFTEEN YEAR WITHOUT LEARNING THE RIGHTS AND THE WRONGS ABOUT DINNER NAY NAY SAID OLD MARTIN I'N GI'EN UP TO MY SON
AND PRESENTLY WHEN TOTTY WAS GONE SHE CAUGHT HIS EYE AND HER FACE BROKE INTO ONE OF ITS BRIGHTEST SMILES AS SHE NODDED TO HIM
NAY NAY LAD SAID SETH THY HONOUR'S OUR HONOUR AND IF THEE GET'ST RESPECT THEE'ST WON IT BY THY OWN DESERTS THE FURTHER I SEE THEE ABOVE ME THE BETTER SO LONG AS THEE FEEL'ST LIKE A BROTHER TO ME IT'S BECAUSE O THY BEING APPOINTED OVER THE WOODS AND IT'S NOTHING BUT WHAT'S RIGHT
FORMED ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL FISHERIES
SEASONABLE ALL THE YEAR BUT NOT SO GOOD IN MAY JUNE AND JULY
TO OBSERVE THE MAGNIFICENT PROSPECT OF A SEA RUNNING MOUNTAINS HIGH AS IT WAS RAINING AT THE TIME HE PUT UP A HUGE GINGHAM UMBRELLA HE HAPPENED TO FIND IN THE HOTEL SUDDENLY HOWEVER A FURIOUS BLAST OF WIND DROVE ACROSS THE CLIFF
THIS APPEARANCE IS GENERALLY CAUSED BY THE FISH HAVING BEEN KNOCKED ABOUT AT SEA
THE NEXT STORY RELATES TO THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE UMBRELLA IN SCOTLAND AND MAY PROBABLY BE REFERRED TO THE TIME WHEN GOOD DOCTOR JAMIESON WAS WALKING ABOUT GLASGOW WITH HIS NEW FANGLED SHELTERING APPARATUS WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM
AND BRING IT GRADUALLY TO BOIL SIMMER VERY GENTLY TILL THE FISH IS DONE WHICH WILL BE IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES BUT THE TIME FOR BOILING OF COURSE DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON THE SIZE OF THE FISH SERVE IT ON A HOT NAPKIN
IS THE PAPER LABEL PASTED ON THE BOTTLE OR POT ON WHICH THE WORD ITSELF IS PRINTED ALL THE SAMPLES OF ANCHOVY PASTE ANALYZED BY DIFFERENT MEDICAL MEN HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE HIGHLY AND VIVIDLY COLOURED
AND WITH THE BORROWED UMBRELLA IN HIS HAND WAS ADVANCING TO THE THRESHOLD
ONE OZ OF BUTTER TWO EGGS SEASONING OF SALT PEPPER NUTMEG AND MACE TO TASTE FOUR COD SOUNDS MODE MAKE THE FORCEMEAT BY MIXING THE INGREDIENTS WELL TOGETHER WASH THE SOUNDS
WHEN THEY ARE STOWED AWAY IN THE HOLD OF THE VESSEL IN BEDS OF FIVE OR SIX YARDS SQUARE HEAD TO TAIL WITH A LAYER OF SALT TO EACH LAYER OF FISH WHEN THEY HAVE LAIN IN THIS STATE THREE OR FOUR DAYS IN ORDER THAT THE WATER MAY DRAIN FROM THEM
AND STRAIN PUT IN THE FISH HEAT IT GRADUALLY BUT DO NOT LET IT BOIL OR IT WILL BE BROKEN TIME ALTOGETHER ONE HOUR SUFFICIENT FOR FOUR PERSONS
AND BROWN BEFORE THE FIRE OR WITH A SALAMANDER
THE AGE OF CARP THIS FISH HAS BEEN FOUND TO LIVE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS
AND STIR IT OVER THE FIRE TILL THE LATTER IS MELTED ADD SEASONING PUT IN THE FISH AND MIX IT WELL WITH THE SAUCE MAKE A BORDER OF FRIED BREAD ROUND THE DISH
SEASONABLE FROM NOVEMBER TO MARCH SUFFICIENT FOR FOUR PERSONS THE SOUNDS IN CODFISH THESE ARE THE AIR OR SWIMMING BLADDERS BY MEANS OF WHICH THE FISHES ARE ENABLED TO ASCEND OR DESCEND IN THE WATER
ITS GREAT RENDEZVOUS ARE THE SANDBANKS OF NEWFOUNDLAND NOVA SCOTIA CAPE BRETON AND NEW ENGLAND THESE PLACES ARE ITS FAVOURITE RESORTS
SALT TO TASTE A FEW DROPS OF GARLIC VINEGAR
AND VENTRAL FINS BEFORE THE PECTORAL ONES
FOR WHICH TO INQUIRE WITH HIS STEREOTYPED HOPE I DON'T INTRUDE OR HIS FRENCH SUCCESSOR THE NOBLEMAN IN THE GRAND DUCHESS WHO INQUIRES IN PLAINTIVE ACCENTS
AND WHEN DONE DRAIN THE FISH AND PUT IT ON A NAPKIN GARNISHED WITH HARD BOILED EGGS CUT IN RINGS TIME ABOUT ONE HOUR
WHEN ABOUT TO RETURN A SHOWER CAME ON AND THE COLONEL POLITELY OFFERED HIM THE LOAN OF AN UMBRELLA WHICH HE GLADLY ACCEPTED AND DANIEL WITH HIS HEAD TWO OR THREE INCHES HIGHER THAN USUAL MARCHED OFF
THAT HE OWED AN EXCELLENT WIFE TO THE INTERPOSITION OF AN UMBRELLA IT APPEARS THAT ON RETURNING HOME ONE DAY IN A HEAVY SHOWER OF RAIN HE FOUND A YOUNG LADY STANDING IN HIS DOORWAY POLITENESS INDUCED HIM TO INVITE HER TO TAKE SHELTER UNDER HIS ROOF
IN THE NEWFOUNDLAND FISHERY THEY ARE TAKEN OUT PREVIOUS TO INCIPIENT PUTREFACTION WASHED FROM THEIR SLIME AND SALTED FOR EXPORTATION THE TONGUES ARE ALSO CURED AND PACKED UP IN BARRELS WHILST FROM THE LIVERS
THICKENING OF FLOUR OR BUTTER LEMON PEEL CHOPPED VERY FINE TO TASTE TWELVE OYSTERS MODE LAY THE COD IN SALT FOR FOUR HOURS THEN WASH IT AND PLACE IT IN A DISH SEASON
WAS IN GREAT ESTIMATION ITS EXTREME RANGE IS EXTENDED INTO THE BLACK SEA THE FISHING FOR THEM IS CARRIED ON DURING THE NIGHT AND LIGHTS ARE USED WITH THE NETS
AND SEW IT UP TO PREVENT THE STUFFING FROM FALLING OUT
AS HE STOOD WISTFULLY GAZING UPON BROWN CURRY AND FOAMING ALLSOP THE ASTONISHED BRUTE TURNED TAIL AND FLED AND THE LADY SAVED HER DINNER NOT MANY YEARS AGO THE UMBRELLA WAS EMPLOYED IN AN EQUALLY CURIOUS MANNER
AND PUT IN SUFFICIENT STOCK TO COVER IT ADD THE HERBS ONIONS AND SPICES AND STEW GENTLY FOR ONE HOUR
MADE MUSTARD OR A FEW GRAINS OF CAYENNE MAY BE ADDED TO THE PASTE BEFORE LAYING IT ON THE TOAST ANCHOVY PASTE WHEN SOME DELICATE ZEST SAYS A WORK JUST ISSUED ON THE ADULTERATIONS OF TRADE
FOR THE CAST CRUST OF SOME NEW COVER'D FISH OR SUCH AS EMPTY LIE AND DECK THE SHORE WHOSE FIRST AND RIGHTFUL OWNERS ARE NO MORE THEY MAKE GLAD SEIZURE OF THE VACANT ROOM AND COUNT THE BORROW'D SHELL THEIR NATIVE HOME
SUCH THINGS BEING UNKNOWN TO HIM IN HIS FATHERLAND HE OF COURSE FOUND THE FIRST ESSAY REMARKABLY UNPLEASANT BUT WITH NATIVE INGENUITY HE SOON DISCOVERED A REMEDY ON OUR ASKING HIM HOW HE LIKED THE HYDROPATHIC SYSTEM HE REPLIED
THE MOST PLEASING THINGS ABOUT IT WERE THE IMMENSE SHOALS OF VERY LARGE CARP
A STOUT STEEL UMBRELLA WOULD OFFER NO CONTEMPTIBLE SHELTER TO A RIFLEMAN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TOO MAY THROW A LIGHT ON A HITHERTO OBSCURE PASSAGE IN MACBETH WHERE BIRNAM WOOD MOVES TO DUNSINANE
THEY FEED VARIOUSLY ON AQUATIC OR MARINE PLANTS SMALL FISH MOLLUSCAE OR DEAD BODIES THE BLACK CLAWED SPECIES IS FOUND ON THE ROCKY COASTS OF BOTH EUROPE AND INDIA AND IS THE SAME THAT IS INTRODUCED TO OUR TABLES
BEGGING YOUR PARDON SIR BUT THERE WAS SOMEONE THERE NOT A MINUTE AGO IMAGINATION CABMAN THE SLANT OF THE LIGHT ON THE GLASS OR YOUR EYESIGHT'S DEFECTIVE EXCUSE ME SIR BUT IT'S NOT MY IMAGINATION AND MY EYESIGHT'S AS GOOD AS ANY MAN'S IN ENGLAND
HAVING REMOVED IT WE PEERED INTO THE CAVITY IT DISCLOSED THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE
IT WASN'T MUCH OF HIS FACE I COULD SEE ONLY HIS FACE AND HIS EYES AND THEY WASN'T PRETTY HE KEPT A THING OVER HIS HEAD ALL THE TIME AS IF HE DIDN'T WANT TOO MUCH TO BE SEEN
IN A GROUP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WELL WE ALL KNOW PRETTY MUCH WHAT'S IN THE COLLECTION GRESHAM SAID WE WERE NEIGHBORS OF HIS AND COLLECTORS ARE A GREGARIOUS LOT BUT WE AREN'T ANXIOUS TO MAKE ANY PREMATURE OFFERS
I KNOW IT I FEEL IT MY INSTINCT TELLS ME SO I STARED IN SUCH A MATTER ONE HARDLY EXPECTS A MAN OF PAUL LESSINGHAM'S STAMP TO TALK OF INSTINCT ATHERTON STARED TOO THEN ON A SUDDEN HE BURST OUT
MY STARS HERE'S A SUDDEN CLEARANCE WHY THE PLACE IS EMPTY EVERYTHING'S CLEAN GONE
AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY COLTS ALL MODELS AND MOST VARIANTS REMEMBER THAT BIG WHITNEYVILLE WALKER IN ORIGINAL CONDITION HE GOT THAT ONE IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR AT THE FRED HINES SALE AT THE OLD WALPOLE GALLERIES
WE WENT FOUR IN THE HANSOM WHICH HAD BEEN WAITING IN THE STREET TO MISSUS HENDERSON'S IN PARADISE PLACE THE INSPECTOR AND WE THREE MISTER PLEESMAN AND GUSTUS BARLEY FOLLOWED ON FOOT THE INSPECTOR WAS EXPLANATORY
THEY OPENED ON TO TWO OR THREE STONE STEPS WHICH LED DIRECTLY INTO THE STREET AT ONE OF THE DOORS STOOD AN OLD LADY WITH A SHAWL DRAWN OVER HER HEAD THIS WAS MISSUS HENDERSON SHE GREETED US WITH GARRULOUS VOLUBILITY
YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE IMITATION COLT NAVY MODELS THAT WERE MADE IN THE SOUTH DURING THE CIVIL WAR RAND NODDED HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE TYPE
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT JEFF LANE FLEMING WOULD KNOW A LOADED REVOLVER WHEN HE SAW ONE I BELIEVE HE DELIBERATELY SHOT HIMSELF AND THE FAMILY FAKED THE ACCIDENT AND FIXED THE AUTHORITIES THE POLICE NEVER MADE ANY INVESTIGATION
I HAVE WELL SOURCES OF INSIDE INFORMATION THIS IS IN CONFIDENCE SO DON'T QUOTE ME
WHAT SORT OF LOOKING BLOKE IS IT WHO'S BEEN MURDERED I DUNNO I AVEN'T SEEN IM MISSUS ENDERSON SHE SAYS TO ME GUSTUS BARLEY SHE SAYS A BLOKE'S BEEN MURDERED
MISSUS HENDERSON LED THE WAY UP A STAIRCASE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DISTINCTLY THE BETTER FOR REPAIRS IT WAS NECESSARY TO PICK ONE'S WAY AS ONE WENT AND AS THE LIGHT WAS DEFECTIVE STUMBLES WERE NOT INFREQUENT
MISTER PHILLIPS DISMISSED HER INQUIRY CURTLY NEVER YOU MIND WHO THEY ARE WHAT'S THIS ABOUT SOMEONE BEING MURDERED SSH THE OLD LADY GLANCED ROUND DON'T YOU SPEAK SO LOUD MISTER PHILLIPS
AS RAND ENTERED HE ROSE FROM BEHIND HIS DESK AND ADVANCED SMILING CORDIALLY WHY HELLO JEFF HE GREETED THE DETECTIVE GRASPING HIS HAND HEARTILY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND FOR MONTHS
WHAT COULD HAVE BECOME IN THE SPACE OF FIFTY SECONDS OF HIS OLD GENT ATHERTON PUT A QUESTION WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE THIS OLD GENT OF YOURS WELL THAT I SHOULDN'T HARDLY LIKE TO SAY
IF HE HADN'T BEEN KILLED JUST WHEN HE WAS HE'D HAVE RUN RIVERS OUT OF THE OLD ARMS BUSINESS I NOTICE THAT RIVERS ISN'T ADVERTISING IN THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN ANY MORE RAND OBSERVED NO
GRESHAM REPLIED HE CONVINCED UNCLE WHISKERS BUT THE N R A TOOK A SLIGHTLY DIMMER VIEW OF THE TRANSACTION SO RIVERS DOESN'T ADVERTISE IN THE RIFLEMAN ANY MORE
THAT THE MAN WAS SERIOUS WAS UNMISTAKABLE AS HE HIMSELF SUGGESTED WHAT INDUCEMENT COULD HE HAVE HAD TO TELL A LIE LIKE THAT THAT HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO HAVE SEEN WHAT HE DECLARED HE SAW WAS PLAIN BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANS AND MY FRIENDS DO TOO WE'LL EXPLAIN AFTERWARDS IN THE MEANTIME I THINK I'D BETTER GET AS MUCH OUT OF HIM AS I CAN WHILE THERE'S TIME YES SAID THE DOCTOR HIS HAND UPON THE PATIENT'S PULSE WHILE THERE'S TIME
THEN WHERE CAN THIS MYSTERIOUS OLD GENTLEMAN HAVE GOT TO CAN YOU SUGGEST AN EXPLANATION IT IS STRANGE TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT THAT THE CABMAN SHOULD BE THE ONLY PERSON TO SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING OF HIM SOME DEVIL'S TRICK HAS BEEN PLAYED
BUT FOR YOU TO SAY THAT HE WASN'T THERE AND NEVER HAD BEEN BLIMEY THAT COPS THE BISCUIT IF HE WASN'T THERE ALL I CAN SAY IS I AIN'T HERE AND MY ORSE AIN'T HERE AND MY CAB AIN'T NEITHER DAMN IT THE HOUSE AIN'T HERE AND NOTHING AIN'T
THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION STOPPED HIS AD AND LIFTED HIS MEMBERSHIP CARD FOR GOOD MEASURE GRESHAM SAID RIVERS SOLD A RIFLE TO A COLLECTOR DOWN IN VIRGINIA ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO WHILE YOU WERE STILL OCCUPYING GERMANY
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE A CASE OF STARVATION OR EXHAUSTION POSSIBLY A COMBINATION OF BOTH WHAT'S THAT ON HIS NECK ASKED THE INSPECTOR HE WAS KNEELING AT MY SIDE HE REFERRED TO TWO ABRASIONS OF THE SKIN ONE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MAN'S NECK
I DOUBT IF THERE WAS AN OUNCE OF FLESH ON THE WHOLE OF HIS BODY HIS CHEEKS AND THE SOCKETS OF HIS EYES WERE HOLLOW THE SKIN WAS DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER HIS CHEEK BONES THE BONES THEMSELVES WERE STARING THROUGH EVEN HIS NOSE WAS WASTED
RIVERS CLAIMED I SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD GOTTEN IT FROM A FAMILY THAT HAD OWNED IT EVER SINCE IT WAS MADE AND SHOWED LETTERS SIGNED D BOONE AND DAVY CROCKETT TO PROVE IT
ON HIS SKELETON FEATURES THERE CAME A LOOK OF PANIC FEAR HE WAS EVIDENTLY STRUGGLING TO SPEAK AT LAST WORDS CAME THE BEETLE HE STOPPED THEN AFTER AN EFFORT SPOKE AGAIN THE BEETLE WHAT'S HE MEAN
THE WHOLE PLACE A LIVING MONUMENT OF THE DEFEAT OF THE SPECULATIVE BUILDER ATHERTON LEAPED OUT ON TO THE GRASS GROWN RUBBLE WHICH WAS MEANT FOR A FOOTPATH I DON'T SEE MARJORIE LOOKING FOR ME ON THE DOORSTEP NOR DID I
OF COURSE IF HE'D CALL ME A CROOK I'D TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT RAND SAID I WONDER IF I COULD MEET YOUR GROUP SAY TOMORROW EVENING I WANT TO BE IN A POSITION TO ASSURE THE FLEMING FAMILY AND HUMPHREY GOODE THAT YOU'RE ALL SERIOUS AND RESPONSIBLE

A FRUIT OF SUCH GREAT ACIDITY THAT EVEN BIRDS REFUSE TO EAT IT IN THIS RESPECT IT NEARLY APPROACHES THE TAMARIND WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR IT MAKES A VERY AGREEABLE PRESERVE OR JELLY ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT MODES OF PREPARING IT
IT WAS EASIER TO GET THE COW UP THE LADDER THAN TO GET THE GRASS DOWN SO SHE PUSHED HER AND COAXED HER AND GOT HER UP AND TIED A STRING ROUND HER NECK AND PASSED IT DOWN THE CHIMNEY
ALL STILL WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TO STRIKE A LIGHT AND TAKING THE GLISTENING FIERY EYES OF THE CAT FOR LIVE COALS HE HELD A LUCIFER MATCH TO THEM EXPECTING IT TO TAKE FIRE BUT THE CAT NOT UNDERSTANDING THE JOKE
WHERE THE ASS WAS STRETCHED OUT IT GAVE HIM A POWERFUL KICK WITH ITS HIND FOOT THIS WAS NOT ALL FOR THE COCK AWAKING AT THE NOISE CLAPPED HIS WINGS AND CRIED FROM THE BEAM COCK A DOODLE DOO COCK A DOODLE DO

AH REPLIED THE HOUND BECAUSE EVERY DAY I GROW OLDER AND WEAKER I CANNOT GO ANY MORE TO THE HUNT AND MY MASTER HAS WELL NIGH BEATEN ME TO DEATH SO THAT I TOOK TO FLIGHT AND NOW
AND THE OTHER HE SLIPPED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND TIED ROUND HIS OWN THIGH AND HE HAD TO MAKE
YES YES I WISH WE WERE THERE REPLIED THE ASS THEN THESE ANIMALS TOOK COUNSEL TOGETHER HOW THEY SHOULD CONTRIVE TO DRIVE AWAY THE ROBBERS AND AT LAST THEY THOUGHT OF A WAY
AND A FINE CROP OF GRASS WAS GROWING THERE NOW THEIR HOUSE LAY CLOSE UP AGAINST A STEEP DOWN AND HE THOUGHT IF HE LAID A PLANK ACROSS TO THE THATCH AT THE BACK HE'D EASILY GET THE COW UP
BUT STILL HE COULDN'T LEAVE THE CHURN FOR THERE WAS HIS LITTLE BABE CRAWLING ABOUT ON THE FLOOR AND IF I LEAVE IT HE THOUGHT THE CHILD IS SURE TO UPSET IT SO HE TOOK THE CHURN ON HIS BACK
AND COULDN'T MANAGE IT AND THE GENTLEMAN WONDERED WHATEVER HE WAS DOING IT FOR AT LAST HE STOPPED AND WIPED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDKERCHIEF OH DEAR HE SAYS I DO THINK TROUSERS ARE THE MOST AWKWARDEST
AND FLED OFF INTO THE FOREST SO THE FOUR COMPANIONS IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND QUICKLY ATE UP ALL THAT WAS LEFT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN FASTING FOR SIX WEEKS AS SOON AS THEY HAD FINISHED THEY EXTINGUISHED
HAD WAITED SEVEN LENGTHS AND SEVEN BREADTHS FOR HER HUSBAND TO COME AND CALL THEM HOME TO DINNER BUT NEVER A CALL THEY HAD AT LAST SHE THOUGHT SHE'D WAITED LONG ENOUGH AND WENT HOME
HE THOUGHT THE COW MIGHT PERHAPS FALL OFF THE THATCH AND BREAK HER LEGS OR HER NECK SO HE GOT UP ON THE HOUSE TO TIE HER UP ONE END OF THE ROPE HE MADE FAST TO THE COW'S NECK
RATHER SIT BY THE FIRE AND SPIN THAN RUN AFTER MICE MY MISTRESS WANTED TO DROWN ME AND SO I RAN AWAY BUT NOW GOOD ADVICE IS DEAR AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO GO WITH US TO BREMEN
AND STOOD THERE ROUTING AND GRUNTING AMONGST THE CREAM WHICH WAS RUNNING ALL OVER THE FLOOR HE GOT SO WILD WITH RAGE THAT HE QUITE FORGOT THE ALE BARREL AND RAN AT THE PIG AS HARD AS HE COULD
EVERY EVENING HE USED TO COME AND SEE HER AND STOP TO SUPPER AT THE FARMHOUSE AND THE DAUGHTER USED TO BE SENT DOWN
IN HAYMAKING TIME HE CAME HOME SCOLDING AND SWEARING AND SHOWING HIS TEETH AND MAKING A DUST DEAR LOVE DON'T BE SO ANGRY THERE'S A GOOD MAN SAID HIS GOODY TO MORROW LET'S CHANGE OUR WORK I'LL GO OUT WITH THE MOWERS
UNTIL THEY CAME TO A WELL LIGHTED ROBBER'S COTTAGE THE ASS AS THE BIGGEST WENT TO THE WINDOW AND PEEPED IN WHAT DO YOU SEE GRAY HORSE ASKED THE COCK
BUT THE LATTER FLEW RIGHT TO THE TOP WHERE HE WAS MOST SAFE BEFORE HE WENT TO SLEEP HE LOOKED ALL ROUND THE FOUR QUARTERS
CLIMBED UP UPON THE DOG AND LASTLY THE COCK FLEW UP AND PERCHED UPON THE HEAD OF THE CAT WHEN THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED AT A GIVEN SIGNAL THEY COMMENCED TOGETHER TO PERFORM THEIR MUSIC
DON'T YOU WISH YOU HAD ONE ANSWERED JOSIE TO WHOM THE WORD MISCHIEF SUGGESTED HER FAVOURITE AMUSEMENT A BRIDE OR A FLOWER ASKED DEMI CALMLY THOUGH HE EYED THE BLOOMING BUSH AS IF IT HAD A SUDDEN AND UNUSUAL INTEREST FOR HIM
AND THEN SHE RAN AWAY TO DO HER GENTLE SPIRITING LIKE ARIEL LEAVING DEMI TO DREAM AMONG THE ROSES LIKE FERDINAND MARY AND LUDMILLA WERE CHARMED WITH THEIR BOUQUETS AND THE GIVER HAD THE DELIGHT OF PUTTING SOME OF THE FLOWERS INTO THE DARK HAIR
AND I'LL TIE THEM UP AND PUT THEM IN HER ROOM SHE IS COMING TO DRESS WITH DAISY SO I CAN DO IT NICELY DEMI MUSED A MOMENT WITH HIS EYES ON THE BRIDAL BUSH AND A SMILE CAME OVER HIS FACE SO UNLIKE ANY IT HAD EVER WORN BEFORE THAT JOSIE WAS TOUCHED
WHO STOOD APART SMILING FELL FLAT ON THEIR FACES FOR THEY SAID IF THESE THINGS ARE DONE WHEN A BUTTERFLY IS DISPLEASED WITH HIS WIFE WHAT SHALL BE DONE TO US WHO HAVE VEXED OUR KING WITH OUR LOUD SPEAKING AND OPEN QUARRELLING THROUGH MANY DAYS
FOR AT HOME THERE WAS AN INVALID MOTHER AND AN OLD FATHER SHE WAS NEEDED THERE WITH ALL THE HELP SHE COULD NOW BRING BY THE ACQUIREMENTS FOUR YEARS OF FAITHFUL STUDY HAD GIVEN HER LOVE LOOKED VERY SWEET AND A HOME OF HER OWN WITH JOHN A LITTLE HEAVEN ON EARTH
I SAID THAT TO QUIET HER AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD SAID
THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE STORIES ABOUT SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD BUT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM IT IS NOT THE STORY OF THE LAPWING WHO FOUND THE WATER
FROM HERE TO THE WIDE WORLD'S END
LITTLE BUT I THINK HIS FIRST INVESTMENT A SAFE AND GOOD ONE FOR HE WHO GIVETH TO THE POOR LENDETH TO THE LORD AND I WAS SO PLEASED AND PROUD I WOULDN'T SPOIL IT BY OFFERING HIM A PENNY
NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO DO IT IF YOU EVER MEAN TO SHE WILL BE GOING AWAY FOR EVER SOON WHO AND DEMI PULLED A HALF OPENED BUD
WHEN THEY BOWED IN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND GROANED AND HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE TREES SAID WHEN THEY RUSTLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING HE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING FROM THE BISHOP ON THE BENCH TO THE HYSSOP ON THE WALL
WHAT ARE YOU AT HERE MISCHIEF ASKED DEMI WITH AN IRVINGESQUE START AS HE FELT RATHER THAN SAW A DISTURBING INFLUENCE IN HIS DAY DREAM GETTING FLOWERS FOR OUR BRIDES
THEN CAME A TERRIBLE NOISE FOR ALL THE NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE QUEENS RAN OUT OF THE PALACE SHRIEKING AND SHOUTING AND CALLING FOR THEIR BABIES THEY HURRIED DOWN THE GREAT MARBLE STEPS BELOW THE FOUNTAIN
BECAUSE I HOPED THAT FOR THE SAKE OF THE JEST MY LORD WOULD MAKE SOME GREAT MAGIC AND THAT THE QUEENS WOULD SEE IT AND BE FRIGHTENED AND SHE TOLD HIM WHAT THE QUEENS HAD SAID AND SEEN AND THOUGHT THEN SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD
BUT BALKIS HID AMONG THE TALL IRISES AND THE SPOTTED BAMBOOS AND THE RED LILLIES BEHIND THE CAMPHOR TREE
AND HE SHALL HAVE IT MISSUS MEG WAS SPEAKING AND STILL OF JOHN WHEN SHE COULD HEAR AGAIN SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT UNWISE AND RECKLESS
THEN THEY PUT THEIR VEILS OVER THEIR HEADS AND THEY PUT THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY TIPTOED BACK TO THE PALACE MOST MOUSY QUIET
AND THE ORANGES ARE JUST RIPENING HE ASKED ME NOT TO STAMP AND I PROMISED I WOULDN'T GRACIOUS SAID HIS WIFE AND SAT QUITE QUIET BUT SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD LAUGHED TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS FACE AT THE IMPUDENCE OF THE BAD LITTLE BUTTERFLY
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WENT OUT FOR PEACE AND QUIET AS USUAL AND AMONG THE ORANGE TREES HE MET BALKIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VERY SORROWFUL BECAUSE SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD WAS SO WORRIED AND SHE SAID TO HIM O MY LORD AND LIGHT OF MY EYES
NOR THE TEARS AND SMILES AND BLUSHES THAT CAME AND WENT AS SHE READ THE NOTE AND PONDERED WHAT ANSWER SHE SHOULD GIVE THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE ONE SHE WISHED TO GIVE BUT DUTY HELD HER BACK
AND THE RIVERS OF THE GOLD OF THE SOUTH FROM THE DESERT OF ZINN TO THE TOWERS OF ZIMBABWE
FOR WE HAVE TAUGHT THE QUEENS OF EGYPT AND ETHIOPIA AND ABYSSINIA AND PERSIA AND INDIA AND CHINA WITH A GREAT AND A MEMORABLE TEACHING AND SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD STILL LOOKING AFTER THE BUTTERFLIES WHERE THEY PLAYED IN THE SUNLIGHT SAID
LOOKED UP INTO SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD'S EYES AND PUT HER HEAD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE JUST LIKE THE BUTTERFLY AND SAID FIRST O MY LORD BECAUSE I LOVED YOU AND SECONDLY O MY LORD BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT WOMEN FOLK ARE
AND SHE WOULD DO HER DUTY BETTER PERHAPS IF NO IMPATIENT LOVER WAITED FOR HER WITH EYES THAT SAW BUT DIMLY AND A HAND THAT LINGERED ON THE STEM HE HAD STRIPPED OF THORNS SHE LAID THE HALF BLOWN FLOWER BY THE ROSE AND ASKED HERSELF
ROSE UP FROM HIS SEAT UNDER THE CAMPHOR TREE AND STRETCHED HIS ARMS AND REJOICED AND SAID O MY LADY AND SWEETENER OF MY DAYS KNOW THAT IF I HAD MADE A MAGIC AGAINST MY QUEENS FOR THE SAKE OF PRIDE OR ANGER
IF YOU WANT TO BE GAY AND EASY OR YOU COULD WRITE A POETICAL POP YOU'VE TRIED IT I DARE SAY BUT SERIOUSLY JO I DO LOVE ALICE AND I THINK SHE KNOWS IT I WANT TO TELL HER SO BUT I LOSE MY HEAD WHEN I TRY
SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD PRESENTLY TWO BUTTERFLIES FLEW UNDER THE TREE QUARRELLING SULEIMAN BIN DAOUD HEARD ONE SAY TO THE OTHER I WONDER AT YOUR PRESUMPTION IN TALKING LIKE THIS TO ME DON'T YOU KNOW THAT IF I STAMPED WITH MY FOOT
O MY LORD AND REGENT OF MY EXISTENCE I HID BEHIND THE CAMPHOR TREE AND SAW IT ALL IT WAS I WHO TOLD THE BUTTERFLY'S WIFE TO ASK THE BUTTERFLY TO STAMP
AND THEY HEARD HIM SAY O WIFE OF MY BROTHER IN THE AIR REMEMBER AFTER THIS TO PLEASE YOUR HUSBAND IN ALL THINGS LEST HE BE PROVOKED TO STAMP HIS FOOT YET AGAIN FOR HE HAS SAID THAT HE IS USED TO THIS MAGIC
IT IS HIS HAVING NOTHING TO OFFER THAT KEEPS HIM SILENT I THINK HE IS SO HONEST
WELL SAID THE BUTTERFLY FANNING HIMSELF MOST IMPORTANTLY BETWEEN YOU AND ME MY DEAR
BUT THEN THE KITCHEN MAID ASKED HIM WHY DO YOU WEAR THAT UGLY WIG OFF WITH IT I WON'T HAVE SUCH A FRIGHT IN HERE NO I CAN'T DO THAT SAID THE LAD FOR I'M NOT QUITE RIGHT IN MY HEAD DO YOU THINK THEN I'LL HAVE YOU IN HERE ABOUT THE FOOD CRIED THE COOK
AND ASK FOR A COAT OF MAIL AND A SWORD AND FOR LEAVE TO GO TO THE WAR
THEY WERE WELL TREATED THEY HAD ROOMS IN THE PALACE AND THE KING COULDN'T TELL HOW TO MAKE ENOUGH OF THEM BUT BOOTS WHO WENT ABOUT IN THE SAME RAGS HE STOOD IN WHEN HE LEFT HOME
BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T HAVE THE MIRTH AT THE PALACE SPOILT BY THOSE DIRTY BLACKGUARDS AND THITHER TOO ONLY JUST AS MUCH FOOD AS WOULD KEEP BODY AND SOUL TOGETHER WAS SENT OVER EVERYDAY
SO WHEN THE TWO BROTHERS HAD EATEN AND DRANK OF ALL THAT WAS IN THE HOUSE AND HAD PAID THE BILL IN HARD CASH THEY SET OFF AGAIN AND BOOTS STOOD UP BEHIND THEIR CARRIAGE
AND NOW I WON'T LIVE ANY LONGER SO JUST TAKE THE SWORD AND CUT MY HEAD OFF NO
YES SAID THE GARDENER YOU'VE GOOD REASON TO FEAR ANY SUCH THING YOU WHO ARE SO HANDSOME WELL WELL SAID THE LAD SINCE IT'S HER WILL I SUPPOSE I MUST GO SO WHEN HE WAS TO GO UP THE STEPS IN THE EVENING
BLACK HORSE TIED UP IN A STALL BY HIMSELF WITH A MANGER OF RED HOT COALS AT HIS HEAD AND A TRUSS OF HAY AT HIS TAIL
NOW HE'S GOT MORE TO BACK HIM BUT NOW THROW DOWN THE STONE AND MIND YOU THROW IT FAR BEHIND ME AND AS SOON AS THE LAD DID WHAT THE HORSE SAID UP ROSE A GREAT BLACK HILL OF ROCK BEHIND HIM
DON'T TAKE ANY OF THE BRIGHT ONES BUT THE MOST RUSTY OF ALL YOU SEE THAT'S THE ONE TO TAKE AND SWORD AND SADDLE YOU MUST CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF JUST IN THE SAME WAY SO THE LAD DID ALL THAT
THEN THE PRINCESS SAID TO HER MAID GO GENTLY AND JUST PULL HIS WIG OFF AND SHE WENT UP TO HIM BUT JUST AS SHE WAS GOING TO WHISK IT OFF HE CAUGHT HOLD OF IT WITH BOTH HANDS
AWAY WITH YOU TO THE COACHMAN YOU'RE BEST FIT TO GO AND CLEAN THE STABLE BUT WHEN THE COACHMAN BEGGED HIM TO TAKE HIS WIG OFF HE GOT THE SAME ANSWER AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE HIM EITHER YOU'D BEST GO DOWN TO THE GARDENER SAID HE
NOW I'M GOING OFF FOR EIGHT DAYS AND THAT TIME YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEND HERE ALL ALONE
BUT JUST AS SHE WAS ABOUT SPITTING THE PIG IN THE KITCHEN SHE MADE AN EXCUSE FOR RUNNING OUT INTO THE YARD AND THEN AND THERE SHE GAVE BOOTS A PAIR OF SCISSORS OF SUCH A KIND THAT THEY CUT OF THEMSELVES OUT OF THE AIR
AND SAW THE LAD STILL SITTING THERE ON HIS HACK THEY BURST OUT LAUGHING AT HIM AGAIN AND ONE OF THEM SHOT AN ARROW AT HIM AND HIT HIM IN THE LEG SO HE BEGAN TO SHRIEK AND TO BEWAIL TWAS ENOUGH TO BREAK ONE'S HEART
THERE SAT THE LAD STILL IN THE BOG AND DUG HIS SPURS INTO HIS THREE LEGGED HACK AND THEY ALL LAUGHED AGAIN NO ONLY JUST LOOK THEY SAID THERE THE FOOL SITS STILL
THEN THE LAD BEGGED AND PRAYED SO HARD THAT HE GOT OFF WITH HIS LIFE BUT THE MAN GAVE HIM A GOOD THRASHING
AND THERE SHE STOOD AND STARED FOR SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD NEVER HAVE HER FILL OF LOOKING AT HIM THEN HER HUSBAND CAME RUNNING THROUGH THE ROOM WITH SOMETHING THE TWO PRINCES HAD ORDERED
AND YOU SHALL SOON HEAR HOW FAR BETTER THIS WAS THAN GOLD AND GOODS SO WHEN THEY HAD ALL WISHED THEIR WISHES THE TWO ELDER WERE FOR SETTING OUT TO SEE THE WORLD AND BOOTS THEIR YOUNGEST BROTHER
TILL THEY CAME TO A KING'S PALACE THERE THE TWO ELDER GAVE THEMSELVES OUT FOR TWO EMPEROR'S SONS AND AS THEY HAD PLENTY OF MONEY AND WERE SO FINE THAT THEIR CLOTHES SHONE AGAIN EVER SO FAR OFF
AND THEN SHE WENT ON SUCH A LOVE SUCH A LOVE YOU NEVER HAD MUCH WIT AND THE LITTLE YOU HAD IS CLEAN GONE I CAN SEE SAID THE MAN WHO WAS MUCH MORE ANGRY THAN THE FIRST INNKEEPER
BUT THEY WERE SCARCELY GONE BEFORE HE RAN TO THE LIME TREE THREW ON HIS COAT OF MAIL AND SHOOK THE BRIDLE AND THERE CAME THE HORSE IN A TRICE AND SAID DO NOW YOUR BEST AND I'LL DO MINE
WHO HAVEN'T A PENNY AND NEVER WILL HAVE ONE WHO DO YOU THINK WILL CARE A BIT ABOUT YOU
BUT CREPT INTO THE ROOM BUT HE SAW NOTHING AT ALL IN THERE BUT A TRAP DOOR ON THE FLOOR AND WHEN HE LIFTED IT UP AND LOOKED DOWN THERE STOOD A GREAT COPPER CAULDRON WHICH
OF THE SUMMERHOUSE IT STOOD UPON BEAMS AND HAD A HIGH STAIRCASE UNDER THAT HE GOT SOME TURF FOR HIS BED AND THERE HE LAY AS WELL AS HE COULD
YOU'RE BEST FIT TO GO ABOUT AND DIG IN THE GARDEN SO HE GOT LEAVE TO BE WITH THE GARDENER BUT NONE OF THE OTHER SERVANTS WOULD SLEEP WITH HIM AND SO HE HAD TO SLEEP BY HIMSELF UNDER THE STEPS
AND HE WASN'T VERY SOFT TONGUED WHEN HE SAW HIS OLD DAME STANDING AND GLOWERING OUT OF THE WINDOW DON'T YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO STAND GAPING AND STARING THERE WHEN WE HAVE SUCH GREAT FOLK IN THE HOUSE HE SAID BACK INTO THE KITCHEN WITH YOU THIS MINUTE
HE COULD DO THAT AND AS FOR THE SWORD HE BRANDISHED IT LIKE A FEATHER NOW SADDLE ME SAID THE HORSE AND PUT ON THE COAT OF MAIL AND THEN TAKE THE BRAMBLE BUSH ROD AND THE STONE AND THE PITCHER OF WATER AND THE POT OF OINTMENT
WAS NO GOOD THE KING WAS ONLY MORE WROTH THAN EVER SOME TIME AFTER CAME A WAR AND UPROAR IN THE LAND
BUT AS I SAID MADAM CONTINUED DOROTHEE WHEN FIRST I HEARD THE MUSIC THAT CAME JUST NOW I THOUGHT IT WAS MY LATE LADY'S AND I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AGAIN WHEN I HAVE HEARD IT AS I HAVE DONE AT INTERVALS EVER SINCE
AS I WAS SAYING THE MARQUIS WAS MOST OUT OF HUMOUR AS I THOUGHT WHEN THE CHEVALIER I SPOKE OF HAD BEEN AT THE CHATEAU AND AT LAST HIS ILL TREATMENT OF MY LADY MADE HER QUITE MISERABLE HE WOULD SEE HARDLY ANY VISITORS AT THE CASTLE AND MADE HER LIVE ALMOST BY HERSELF
DEPRESSED BY SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT CHEERFUL OBJECTS RATHER ADDED TO THAN REMOVED THIS DEPRESSION BUT PERHAPS SHE YIELDED TOO MUCH TO HER MELANCHOLY INCLINATION AND IMPRUDENTLY LAMENTED THE MISFORTUNE
A LITTLE BIRD NO NATIVE TO US BUT THAN ANY NATIVE DEARER BUT LO IN THE VERY NIGHT WHICH FOLLOWED OLD SIR ENSOR'S FUNERAL SUCH A STORM OF SNOW BEGAN AS NEVER HAVE I HEARD NOR READ OF NEITHER COULD HAVE DREAMED IT
PRAY RESUME YOUR STORY OF THE MARCHIONESS SAID EMILY AND ACQUAINT ME WITH THE MANNER OF HER DEATH I WILL MA'AM SAID DOROTHEE BUT SHALL WE LEAVE THE WINDOW THIS COOL AIR REFRESHES ME REPLIED EMILY AND I LOVE TO HEAR IT CREEP ALONG THE WOODS
IT FLASHED LIKE THE SPRAY OF A FOUNTAIN UPON US IN THE DARK WINTER OF THE ROOM HE COULD NOT TAKE IT IN HIS HAND BUT LET IT HANG AS DAISIES DO ONLY MAKING LORNA SEE THAT HE MEANT HER TO HAVE IT
THIS MOVEMENT OF THE BIRDS WENT ON EVEN FOR A WEEK OR MORE EVERY KIND OF THRUSHES PASSED US EVERY KIND OF WILD FOWL EVEN PLOVERS WENT AWAY AND CROWS AND SNIPES AND WOOD COCKS
AND TO BE SURE HE DID SEEM TO BE OVERWHELMED WITH THE THOUGHT OF HIS TREATMENT OF HER AND THIS AFFECTED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE FAINTED AWAY WE THEN GOT MY LORD OUT OF THE ROOM
AND THUS ENDEAVOURED GRADUALLY TO WITHDRAW HER FROM THE SUBJECT OF HER GRIEF AND TO AWAKE OTHER INTERESTS IN HER MIND EMILY TO WHOM HE APPEARED AS THE ENLIGHTENED FRIEND AND PROTECTOR OF HER YOUTH SOON FELT FOR HIM THE TENDER AFFECTION OF A DAUGHTER
AND EVEN THE POULTRY SHOULD BE BROUGHT IN SNUG AND WITH PLENTY TO EAT AND FODDER ENOUGH TO ROAST THEM
RECEIVED NOTICE TO GO FOR MY LORD WENT TO THE WARS I NEVER SAW HIM AFTER FOR HE WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE CHATEAU THOUGH IT IS SUCH A FINE PLACE AND NEVER FINISHED THOSE FINE ROOMS HE WAS BUILDING ON THE WEST SIDE OF IT
BUT MY LORD ALL OF A SUDDEN GREW GLOOMY AND FRETFUL AND VERY UNKIND SOMETIMES TO MY LADY THIS AFFLICTED HER VERY MUCH AS I SAW FOR SHE NEVER COMPLAINED AND SHE USED TO TRY SO SWEETLY TO OBLIGE HIM AND TO BRING HIM INTO A GOOD HUMOUR
SHE WAS SO MUCH ATTACHED TO AND WAS AFTERWARDS AFRAID TO OWN IT TO HER FATHER WHO WAS A VERY STERN MAN BUT THIS SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY AND I NEVER GAVE MUCH FAITH TO IT
I FOLLOWED THE BENT OF HIS POOR SHRUNKEN HAND AND SOUGHT AMONG THE PILINGS AND THERE I FELT SOMETHING HARD AND SHARP AND DREW IT FORTH AND GAVE IT TO HIM
NOT WITH ANY HEAT OF SPEED NEITHER FLYING FAR AT ONCE BUT ALL AS IF ON BUSINESS BOUND PARTLY RUNNING PARTLY FLYING PARTLY FLUTTERING ALONG
I HAVE LISTENED IN THE ANTI CHAMBER FOR THE HOUR TOGETHER AND SHE WOULD SOMETIMES SIT PLAYING WITH THE WINDOW OPEN WHEN IT WAS SUMMER TIME TILL IT WAS QUITE DARK AND WHEN I HAVE GONE IN TO SHUT IT SHE HAS HARDLY SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT HOUR IT WAS
OR BY APPROACHING THE FORTRESS WITH THE SECRECY CONSISTENT WITH THE MARCH OF SMALLER BODIES OF TROOPS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE EITHER OF THE TREACHERY OR NEGLIGENCE OF SOME OF HIS PARTY AND TO RUSH UNEXPECTEDLY UPON THE WHOLE
AND AN HOUR PERHAPS UPON LORNA AND ME WE MUST BOTH HAVE WEARIED OF HIM AND REQUIRED CHANGE OF AIR BUT NOW I LONGED TO SEE AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT HIM AND HOPED THAT HE MIGHT NOT GO TO HEAVEN FOR AT LEAST A WEEK OR MORE HOWEVER
WHO SINCERELY ATTEMPTED WHATEVER BENEVOLENCE COULD SUGGEST FOR SOFTENING THEM SOMETIMES ALLOWED HER THE SOLITUDE SHE WISHED FOR SOMETIMES LED HER INTO FRIENDLY PARTIES AND CONSTANTLY PROTECTED HER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
STILL HER THOUGHTS WERE EMPLOYED BY CONSIDERATIONS WHICH WEAKENED HER CURIOSITY AND DOROTHEE'S TAP AT THE DOOR SOON AFTER TWELVE SURPRISED HER ALMOST AS MUCH AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED I AM COME AT LAST LADY
DOROTHEE HOWEVER STEADILY REFUSED TO DO THIS AND THEN RETURNED TO THE NOTICE OF EMILY'S LIKENESS TO THE LATE MARCHIONESS THERE IS ANOTHER PICTURE OF HER ADDED SHE HANGING IN A ROOM OF THE SUITE WHICH WAS SHUT UP
BUT NOBODY DARED TO MAKE ANY STIR ABOUT THEM WHEN MY LORD HEARD THAT MY LADY WAS DEAD HE SHUT HIMSELF UP AND WOULD SEE NOBODY BUT THE DOCTOR WHO USED TO BE WITH HIM ALONE SOMETIMES FOR AN HOUR TOGETHER
AND IT GREATLY KEPT MY SPIRITS DOWN ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT SO VERY MUCH FRIGHTEN ME FOR IT TAKES A MAN BUT A LITTLE WHILE HIS INSTINCT BEING OF DEATH PERHAPS
AND MY LADY MORE THOUGHTFUL AND IT CAME INTO MY HEAD THAT THIS WAS THE CHEVALIER SHE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED BUT I NEVER COULD LEARN FOR CERTAIN WHAT WAS THE CHEVALIER'S NAME DOROTHEE SAID EMILY
THE ANCIENT OUTLAW'S FUNERAL WAS A GRAND AND MOVING SIGHT MORE PERHAPS FROM THE SENSE OF CONTRAST THAN FROM THAT OF FITNESS TO SEE THOSE DARK AND MIGHTY MEN INURED TO ALL OF SIN AND CRIME RECKLESS BOTH OF MAN AND GOD
FOR SHE WAS MUCH AFFECTED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE LATE MARCHIONESS AND BY THE MEEK PATIENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD SUFFERED WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME RESUMED DOROTHEE ALAS HE CAME TOO LATE
WITH A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HEAVE AN ASH TREE UP THE CHIMNEY PLACE AND THAT WAS HOW THE BIRDS WERE GOING RATHER THAN FLYING AS THEY USED TO FLY ALL THE BIRDS WERE SET IN ONE DIRECTION STEADILY JOURNEYING WESTWARD
THAT THE EXPEDITION WAS UNDERTAKEN AND ITS SUCCESS WAS SO ACCEPTABLE TO THEM THAT MORANO WAS INSTANTLY RELEASED NOTWITHSTANDING THE POLITICAL SUSPICIONS WHICH MONTONI BY HIS SECRET ACCUSATION HAD EXCITED AGAINST HIM THE CELERITY AND EASE
AND SIR TRISTRAM SMOTE HIM HARDER AND SORER WITH SUCH A MIGHT THAT HE BARE HIM CLEAN OUT OF HIS SADDLE TO THE EARTH WITH THAT SIR TRISTRAM TURNED ABOUT AND SAID FAIR KNIGHTS I HAD NO NEED TO JOUST WITH YOU
AN EVER YE ESCAPE HIS HANDS RIGHT SO SIR TRISTRAM
WHAT IS BEST TO DO AWAKE HIM
AND THIS IS THE CAUSE WHY I AM SO LOATH TO HAVE ADO WITH YOU FOR I MUST FIGHT WITHIN THESE THREE DAYS WITH A GOOD KNIGHT AND AS VALIANT AS ANY IS NOW LIVING AND IF I BE HURT I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO DO BATTLE WITH HIM
AND SO HE RODE UNTO THE KNIGHTS AND CRIED UNTO THEM
WHO HATH SLAIN YOUR LORD SIR SHE SAID HERE CAME A KNIGHT RIDING AS MY LORD AND I RESTED US HERE AND ASKED HIM OF WHENCE HE WAS
YE SAY WELL SAID SIR TRISTRAM NOW I ASSIGN YOU TO MEET ME IN THE MEADOW BY THE RIVER OF CAMELOT WHERE MERLIN SET THE PERON SO THEY WERE AGREED
WITH SUCH A COGNISANCE WITH A COVERED SHIELD FAIR SIR SAID THESE KNIGHTS SUCH A KNIGHT MET WITH US TO OUR GREAT DAMAGE AND FIRST HE SMOTE DOWN MY FELLOW SIR BLEOBERIS
AND RODE HIS WAY EARLY ON THE MORN AND BY SUDDEN ADVENTURE SIR TRISTRAM MET WITH SIR SAGRAMORE LE DESIROUS AND WITH SIR DODINAS LE SAVAGE
AND SO EITHER GAVE OTHER THE DEGREE AND THEN THEY BOTH FORTHWITHAL WENT TO THE STONE AND SET THEM DOWN UPON IT AND TOOK OFF THEIR HELMS TO COOL THEM
HAVE HAD GREAT TRAVAIL AND THEREFORE YE ARE A VILLAINOUS KNIGHT TO ASK BATTLE OF ME CONSIDERING MY GREAT TRAVAIL HOWBEIT I WILL NOT FAIL YOU
AND BY FORTUNE IN A MEADOW SIR TRISTRAM MET WITH SIR KAY THE SENESCHAL AND SIR DINADAN WHAT TIDINGS WITH YOU SAID SIR TRISTRAM WITH YOU KNIGHTS NOT GOOD SAID THESE KNIGHTS
AND IN EVERY PLACE HE ASKED AND DEMANDED AFTER SIR LAUNCELOT BUT IN NO PLACE HE COULD NOT HEAR OF HIM WHETHER HE WERE DEAD OR ALIVE WHEREFORE SIR TRISTRAM MADE GREAT DOLE AND SORROW SO SIR TRISTRAM RODE BY A FOREST
AND THEN THEY RODE TOGETHER AND SO HE HURT MY FELLOW AND WHEN HE HAD DONE SO I MIGHT NOT FOR SHAME BUT I MUST JOUST WITH HIM AND AT THE FIRST COURSE HE SMOTE ME DOWN AND MY HORSE TO THE EARTH
AND A LADY WEEPING BESIDE HIM AND WHEN I SAW HER MAKING SUCH DOLE I ASKED HER WHO SLEW HER LORD SIR SHE SAID THE FALSEST KNIGHT OF THE WORLD NOW LIVING AND HE IS THE MOST VILLAIN THAT EVER MAN HEARD SPEAK OF
FOR IT IS NO POINT OF MY CHARGE AND YET I TRUST TO GOD TO BEAR THEM WITH WORSHIP TRULY SAID KING ARTHUR YE OUGHT NOT TO BEAR NONE ARMS BUT IF YE WIST WHAT YE BEAR BUT I PRAY YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME
AND I PROMISED HER TO BE HER WARRANT AND TO HELP HER TO INTER HER LORD AND SO SUDDENLY AS I CAME RIDING BY THIS TOWER
AND THEREFORE AN YE WILL NEEDS HAVE ADO WITH ME ASSIGN ME A DAY
AND THEN SIR GAWAINE ASKED HIM HIS NAME THEN HE SAID MY NAME IS SIR TRISTRAM AND SO EITHER TOLD OTHER THEIR NAMES AND THEN DEPARTED SIR TRISTRAM AND RODE HIS WAY
AND THESE TWO KNIGHTS MET WITH SIR TRISTRAM AND QUESTIONED WITH HIM AND ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD JOUST WITH THEM FAIR KNIGHTS SAID SIR TRISTRAM WITH A GOOD WILL I WOULD JOUST WITH YOU
AND MY LORD SAID OF ARTHUR'S COURT THEREFORE SAID THE STRONG KNIGHT I WILL JOUST WITH THEE
AND CRIED ALOUD UNTO SIR TRISTRAM AND SAID KNIGHT DEFEND THEE SO THEY CAME TOGETHER AS THUNDER AND SIR UWAINE BRISED HIS SPEAR ALL TO PIECES UPON SIR TRISTRAM'S SHIELD
AND SMOTE HIM CLEAN FROM HIS SADDLE TO THE EARTH AND HURT HIM ON THE LEFT SIDE THAT SIR TRISTRAM LAY IN GREAT PERIL THEN HE WALLOPED FARTHER
AND THERE HE STRUCK HIM A PART THROUGH THE BODY THAT HE FELL FROM HIS HORSE TO THE EARTH AND THEN THIS STRANGE KNIGHT LEFT THEM THERE AND TOOK HIS WAY THROUGH THE FOREST
I SHOULD NOT HAVE ADO WITH HIM FOR WHY HE WAS OVERSTRONG FOR ME THAT STRONG KNIGHT TOOK HIS WORDS AT SCORN AND SAID
AND THIS IS THE CAUSE WHEREFORE WE DID THIS BATTLE WELL SAID SIR TRISTRAM NOW I UNDERSTAND THE MANNER OF YOUR BATTLE BUT IN ANY WISE HAVE REMEMBRANCE OF YOUR PROMISE THAT YE HAVE MADE WITH ME TO DO BATTLE WITH ME THIS DAY FORTNIGHT
TO TELL ANY MAN MY NAME TRULY SAID SIR LAUNCELOT AN I WERE REQUIRED I WAS NEVER LOATH TO TELL MY NAME IT IS WELL SAID SAID SIR TRISTRAM THEN I REQUIRE YOU TO TELL ME YOUR NAME
MY NAME IS SIR TRISTRAM YOUR MORTAL ENEMY
THAT IS TRUTH SAID SIR SAGRAMORE AND SIR DODINAS FOR WE WILL BE REVENGED OF THE DESPITE YE HAVE DONE TO US FAIR KNIGHTS SAID SIR TRISTRAM THAT SHALL LITTLE NEED YOU FOR ALL THAT I DID TO YOU YE CAUSED IT
IT IS NOT LONG AGO SITHEN I SMOTE YOU TO THE EARTH AT YOUR OWN REQUEST AND DESIRE I WOULD HAVE RIDDEN BY YOU BUT YE WOULD NOT SUFFER ME AND NOW MESEEMETH YE WOULD DO MORE BATTLE WITH ME
BUT THROUGH SIR TRISTRAM'S GREAT FORCE HE STRUCK SIR SAGRAMORE FROM HIS HORSE THEN HE HURLED HIS HORSE FARTHER AND SAID TO SIR DODINAS KNIGHT MAKE THEE READY
OR OF TWO AND THREE SOMETIMES A MIXTURE OF BOTH IN THE SAME COMPOSITION WHILE THE SEVEN BEAT MEASURE IS TAKEN IN GROUPS OF FOUR AND THREE OR OF THREE AND FOUR
THE SECOND AND FOURTH UNACCENTED
IN WHICH THERE ARE THREE BEATS THE FIRST ONE BEING ACCENTED THE SECOND AND THIRD UNACCENTED
DURING MY TRIP OUT FROM ALASKA THE FALL BEFORE WHILE I WAS UPON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A DOZEN OR MORE OF THE PASSENGERS WITH WHOM I HAD TRAVELED FROM THE SAME PLACE OF PASSENGERS WE HAD ALL TOLD
AND WAS WATCHED WITH EAGER EYES BY EVERYONE WE ATE LETTUCE AND RADISHES PICKED FRESH FROM THE GARDEN BEDS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SOWN BY THE CAPTAIN'S OWN HANDS AND WE FOUND AGEETUK AND MOLLIE TO BE QUITE FAMOUS COOKS
AND THAT A COMPOUND MEASURE IS ONE IN WHICH EACH BEAT IS REPRESENTED BY A DOTTED NOTE WHOSE VALUE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS
NOTHING SO DELICIOUS AS THEIR SALADS FOR THE FRENCH COOKS HAD LONG AGO GONE THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT BEING CHANGED AND MOLLIE HAD A NICE LITTLE KITCHEN OF HER OWN AND WITH FRESH SALMON TROUT WILD FOWL
AND HOPED THEY WOULD IF THAT WOULD PUT AN END TO THEIR SUFFERINGS WE TRIED AT LAST TO GIVE THEM COMFORT BY RECOMMENDING OUT OF FORMER EXPERIENCES SHIP'S BISCUIT DRY TOAST AND POP CORN AS REMEDIES
QUINTUPLE FIVE BEAT AND SEPTUPLE SEVEN BEAT MEASURES ARE OCCASIONALLY MET WITH BUT THESE ARE RARE AND WILL ALWAYS BE SPORADIC THE FIVE BEAT MEASURE IS TAKEN AS A COMBINATION OF THREE AND TWO
AND SHE LIKE AN OASIS IN A DESERT PLACE IS LEFT HERE TO CHEER LOVE AND HELP OTHERS MANY TIMES I HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OF THE SWEET AND GENTLE INFLUENCES GOING OUT FROM THE LIFE OF LITTLE YAHKUK
AN ENGLISH FAMILY CONSISTING OF THE MOTHER ONE SON AND A DAUGHTER WERE TO ACCOMPANY ME AND WE HAD SPENT WEEKS IN MAKING OUR PREPARATIONS WE WERE TAKING SUPPLIES OF CLOTHING FOOD
AFFAIRS CONNECTED WITH MY GOLD CLAIMS WERE WITH
I WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO SAINT MICHAEL UP THE YUKON TO DAWSON AND OUTSIDE AND LAID MY PLANS ACCORDINGLY
WITH THE HELP OF SEVERAL SINGERS ON BOARD GAVE CONCERTS IN THE DINING SALON WHICH THOUGH IMPROMPTU WERE VERY ENJOYABLE A SWEET AND TRAINED SINGER WAS THE ENGLISH GIRL OF OUR COMPANY
WITH NEWSPAPERS AND TIDINGS OF FRIENDS IN THE STATES THEN OUR FINGERS TREMBLED AT OPENING OUR LETTERS UNTIL WE FOUND THAT ALL OUR DEAR ONES WERE WELL AND WE HEARTILY THANKED THE LORD
DURING THE NINE DAYS SAIL FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO UNALASKA A DISTANCE OF TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILES I STUDIED WELL THE PASSENGERS WE HAD PREACHERS ON BOARD
THOSE WHO WERE CONTINUALLY SEASICK HAD DIVERSION ENOUGH IT WAS USELESS FOR US TO TELL THEM A PATHETIC TALE OF SOME ONE WHO AT SOME TIME HAD BEEN MORE ILL THAN THEY BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT
OR WILD FOWL FOR HER SUPPER SOMETIMES IT WAS CANDY NUTS OR FRESH FRUIT FROM NOME AND WITH EVERYTHING SHE WAS WELL PLEASED AND JOYOUS FRIENDS SOON CAME IN FROM THE OUTSIDE BRINGING CITY DOLLS DRESSED IN RIBBONS AND LACES
FOUR SEXTUPLE IN WHICH THERE ARE SIX BEATS THE FIRST AND FOURTH BEING ACCENTED THE OTHERS NOT IN RAPID TEMPI THIS IS ALWAYS TAKEN AS COMPOUND DUPLE MEASURE A DOTTED QUARTER NOTE HAVING A BEAT
A PACE WHICH MY ENGLISH FRIENDS AND OTHERS COULD NOT FOLLOW FOR THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLY ILL IN THE REGION OF THEIR DIGESTIVE APPARATUS FOR SEVERAL DAYS I SLEPT FOR HOURS EACH DAY AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE TRIP
AND SHE SANG MANY TIMES ACCOMPANIED BY THE STRINGED INSTRUMENTS OF THE MUSICIANS MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE ASSEMBLED PASSENGERS WHEN SHE SANG ONE EVENING IN HER CLEAR SYMPATHETIC VOICE THE SELECTION
ON MONDAY JUNE FOURTH WE SAW FROM THE DECK A FEW DRIFTING LOGS AND A QUANTITY OF SEAWEED AND THESE WITH THE PRESENCE OF GULLS AND GOONIES FLYING OVERHEAD CONVINCED US THAT WE WERE NEARING LAND
THESE WERE MEN GOING WITH ALL THE OTHERS TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNES IN THE NEW GOLD FIELDS WORKING THEIR PASSAGE AS WAITERS ON THE SHIP TO NOME WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LEAVE IT THREE EVENINGS IN THE WEEK THESE MUSICIANS
ARE ALSO CLASSIFIED AS COMPOUND MEASURES AN ENGLISH WRITER
NO TREE NOR SHRUB OBSTRUCTED THE WAY WITH GNARLED OLD TRUNKS TWISTED ROOTS OR LOW HANGING BRANCHES FOR NONE GROW IN UNALASKA
CHAPTER TEN MEASURE NINETY SEVEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE EYE A MEASURE IS THAT PORTION OF THE STAFF FOUND BETWEEN TWO BARS IN CERTAIN CASES THIS SPACE MAY BE LESS THAN A MEASURE
AND MY WHOLE TIME WAS GIVEN TO HER BEFORE ONE OF THE SUNNY SOUTH WINDOWS OF THE LIVING ROOM WE PLACED HER COT EACH MORNING AND HERE SHE RECEIVED HER NUMEROUS FRIENDS BOTH ESKIMO AND WHITE AND THEIR NAMES WERE LEGION
WHERE HE COULD DO BEACH MINING I WAS NOT ABOVE DOING ANY HONEST WORK AND FELT CONFIDENT THAT I COULD MAKE MY WAY IF I COULD GAIN AN ENTRANCE INTO THAT COUNTRY THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WERE ALL WORKERS AND I HAD KNOWN THEM FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE
AND THE BOLD DIGNITY AND GRANDEUR OF THE MOUNTAINS IS NEVER DIMINISHED BY THESE LESSER OBJECTS AS OUR SHIP SAILED OUT INTO BEHRING SEA WE WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THE STEAMER GEORGE W ELDER WHOSE MASTER
WHEN I LAUGHINGLY CALLED THE ATTENTION OF ONE OF THE OWNERS OF THE SHIP TO THE FACT THAT THAT DATE FELL UPON FRIDAY AND MANY PERSONS OBJECTED TO SAILING UPON THAT DAY HE POSTPONED THE STARTING OF THE SAINT PAUL TO MAY TWENTY SIXTH
AND DRINKING SOME WATER OUT OF A CHINA CUP SAT HER DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE COUCH AS BEFORE WHEN SHE SAW I HAD DONE EATING SHE WENT THEN TO ANOTHER CABINET AND PULLING OUT A DRAWER SHE BROUGHT IT TO ME
BUT THEY GET OVER IT RIGHT AWAY IT'S JUST LIKE CHANGING INTO A NEW SUIT I EXPECT YEAH I GUESS SO WELL GOO NIGHT LITTLE FELLER
BUT ALMOST TO HAVE MADE A NATION RICH AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH CONSIDERING THE COSTLY THINGS WE TOOK HERE WHICH WE DID NOT KNOW THE VALUE OF AND BESIDES GOLD AND SILVER AND JEWELS I SAY WE NEVER KNEW HOW RICH WE WERE
IS NOT SO MUCH A COACHING SYSTEM AS A GOOD LEASH TO KEEP THE MASCOTS FROM GETTING RUN OVER CHAMP AND JIMMY RUSHED INTO THE LOCKER ROOM JUST AS THE BIG BLUE TEAM WAS ABOUT TO TROT OUT FOR THE SECOND HALF AFTER THAT
EXCEPT THOSE WITH JIM AND WALLY WHICH THEY REFUSED TO PARTITION
WHILE THE BOYS KEPT UP A RUNNING FIRE OF CHEERY TALK WHATEVER WAS TO COME THEY WOULD MEET IT WITH THEIR HEADS UP
HOWEVER TWO OF THE OTHER LADIES CAME ALL CRYING AND KNEELED DOWN TO ME WITH THEIR HANDS LIFTED UP WHAT THEY MEANT I KNEW NOT AT FIRST
HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT SOME DAY HE WOULD ENTER THOSE PLACES AS A GUEST BOWED TO BY SUCH SERVANTS AS HE HAD BEEN IT WAS POSSIBLE HE PROMISED HIMSELF BRAVELY
I WE HOPE THEY WILL GET PLENTY OF CHANCES
THEN YOU'LL COME TO NIGHT OF COURSE WE WILL SHE WATCHED THEM STRIDE OFF INTO THE SHRUBBERY AND CHOKED BACK A SIGH NORAH CAME BACK TO THEM THROUGH THE TREES
WHO COULD NOT WELL BE EXPECTED TO BE CAPTIOUS CHAMP NAMED AFTER THE YALE CHESS TEAM CAME BY ACCIDENT TO THE FIELD JUST AS CURLY CORLISS WAS OFF ON ONE OF HIS LONG RUNS
SHOT ACROSS THE HEDGE BUT YOUNG MORTON WAS MUCH TOO INTENT UPON THE FATE OF HIS GODDESS TO HAVE EYES FOR ANYTHING ELSE
BUT SITTING DOWN MYSELF ON THE SIDE OF HER COUCH OR BED MADE A MOTION TO HER TO SIT DOWN TOO BUT HERE SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AGAIN IT SEEMS
I'M ALL RIGHT NOW JIMMY TOLD THE DOCTOR HONEST I AM CAN I GO I GOTTA TAKE CHAMP OUT TO THE GAME HE'S THE MASCOT AND THEY CAN'T WIN WITHOUT HIM PLEASE MISTER LET ME GO
WITHOUT ANY GREAT COMPLIMENT TOOK THEM AS FAST AS SHE GAVE THEM ME AND PUT THEM INTO MY POCKET TAKING NO GREAT NOTICE OF THEM OR OF HER WHICH FRIGHTED HER WORSE THAN ALL THE REST AND SHE SAID SOMETHING WHICH I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
MADE A LUMP COME INTO NORAH'S THROAT AND THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR THAT TO NIGHT OF ALL NIGHTS JACK BLAKE SANG THEM A STOCKRIDER'S SONG WITH A CHORUS IN WHICH ALL THE AUSTRALIANS JOINED
JEWELS AND WEALTH THIS WAS A BOOTY WORTH WATCHING FOR THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SOME MONTHS LONGER SO I RESOLVED THAT WE WOULD GO AND CRUISE OFF POINT NEGARIS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE BAY NEAR DIAMOND ISLE
I LET THEM KNOW I WOULD NOT HURT THE QUEEN NOR LET ANY ONE ELSE HURT HER BUT THAT SHE MUST GIVE ME ALL HER JEWELS AND MONEY UPON THIS THEY ACQUAINTED HER THAT I WOULD SAVE HER LIFE AND NO SOONER HAD THEY ASSURED HER OF THAT
AS MEADE MINNIGERODE HAS ACCOMPLISHED FOR YALE IN THE BIG YEAR GEORGE MORTON MIGHT NEVER HAVE GONE TO ANY COLLEGE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR SYLVIA PLANTER
IF ONLY HE COULD WIN A YALE OR A HARVARD GAME PERHAPS THIS EXPLAINS WHY ONE MEETS SO FEW PRINCETON MEN SOCIALLY SOME WE HAVE FOUND
THOUGH WITHOUT PROSPECT OF WHAT HAPPENED I CRUISED HERE ABOUT TWO MONTHS FINDING NOTHING WORTH WHILE SO I STOOD AWAY TO A PORT ON THE NORTH POINT OF THE ISLE OF SUMATRA WHERE I MADE NO STAY
WELL IF WE DON'T GO INTO HOSPITAL AFTER THEM WE'LL LET YOU KNOW THEY CAME INTO THE HOUSE WHERE ALREADY THE NEWS OF THE BOYS GOING HAD SPREAD AND THE ONCE TIRED'S AS WALLY CALLED THEIR GUESTS
STILL AS PROFESSOR BILLY PHELPS HAS TAUGHT HIS STUDENTS TO SAY FOOTBALL ISN'T EVERYTHING PERHAPS SOMETHING OF SPARTA HAS GONE FROM YALE FOR A FEW YEARS OR FOREVER
WAS THE USUAL FORM OF HER REPLIES TO HIS ARDENT WORDS OF WOOING NATURALLY HE KNEW THAT HE HAD HER ON THE RUN A MAN WHO HAD TAKEN MORE THAN ONE STRAIGHT ARM SQUARELY IN THE FACE DURING THE COURSE OF HIS FOOTBALL CAREER
IN A DESPERATE EFFORT TO PREVENT HIM FROM FURTHER MOLESTING CURLY CHAMP WAS IMMEDIATELY ADOPTED BY THE TEAM AS MASCOT IT SEEMS TO US HE DESERVED MORE
WITH NO VERY GOOD REASON A TANGO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYTHING BUT IT SATISFIED THE PERFORMERS THE MUSIC STOPPED SUDDENLY AND MISTER LINTON WOUND UP THE GRAMOPHONE FOR THE LAST TIME
AS THEY STOOD SO THICK KILLED A GREAT MANY OF THEM AND MADE ALL THE REST RUN DOWN UNDER THEIR HATCHES CRYING OUT LIKE CREATURES BEWITCHED IN A WORD WE PRESENTLY TOOK THE SHIP AND HAVING SECURED HER MEN WE CHASED THE OTHER TWO
BUT HE HEARD PEOPLE SHOUTING AND THEN SOMETHING STRUCK HIM AND HE WAS DRAGGED VIOLENTLY AWAY
PEOPLE ONLY THINK YOU ARE A WORM AND TRAMPLE ON YOU COME HERE GEOFF AND TAKE CARE OF ME AND GEOFFREY WHO ADORED HIM CAME HAVE YOU BEEN RIDING OLD BRECON LATELY
BUT BY THEIR GESTURES AND POINTINGS I FOUND AT LAST IT WAS TO BEG THE YOUNG QUEEN'S LIFE AND THAT I WOULD NOT KILL HER WHEN THE THREE LADIES KNEELED DOWN TO ME
IT WAS HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO BUY AND ALL SHE COULD THINK OF WAS CAKE
SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE GARDEN AND AT LAST MISSUS DONNELLY SAID SOMETHING VERY CROSS TO ONE OF THE NEXT DOOR GIRLS AND TOLD HER TO THROW IT OUT AT ONCE THAT WAS NO PLAY MARIA UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS WRONG THAT TIME AND SO SHE HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN
AND I COULD FIND NO BIGGER ONES I WISH THEY WERE AS BIG AS OSTRICH EGGS LET NOT YOUR HIGH MIGHTINESS FORGET TO WRITE TO ME
A COMPANY OF SOLDIERS PASSED THROUGH HERE WHEN THEY LEFT THEY TOOK AWAY WITH THEM THREE OF THE GIRLS OF THE VILLAGE I WILL NOT TELL THEE WHO THEY ARE
SO SAD SO DEEP AND SO DOLEFUL THAT SHE PUT ALL WHO HEARD AND SAW HER INTO A STATE OF PERPLEXITY
HE SUPPOSED THE BAG WAS FULL OF GOOD THINGS FOR THE LITTLE ONES AND SAID IT WAS ONLY RIGHT THAT THE YOUNGSTERS SHOULD ENJOY THEMSELVES WHILE THEY WERE YOUNG MARIA AGREED WITH HIM AND FAVOURED HIM WITH DEMURE NODS AND HEMS
THEY APPEARED WITH TWO PEASANT GIRLS
THERE WAS ONE THING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND THAT WAS THE TRACTS ON THE WALKS BUT THE MATRON WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON TO DEAL WITH SO GENTEEL WHEN THE COOK TOLD HER EVERYTHING WAS READY
FOR TO EXPECT THAT MY LORD THE DUKE WILL DO ME JUSTICE IS TO ASK PEARS FROM THE ELM TREE FOR THE REASON I STATED PRIVATELY TO YOUR WORSHIP AND SO MAY OUR LORD GRANT YOU GOOD HEALTH AND FORSAKE US NOT
THAT ONE WOULD HAVE FANCIED THE WHOLE ISLAND WAS GOING TO THE BOTTOM HE SAT UP IN BED AND REMAINED LISTENING INTENTLY TO TRY IF HE COULD MAKE OUT WHAT COULD BE THE CAUSE OF SO GREAT AN UPROAR
AND THOU KNOWEST THEY SAY SUDDEN JOY KILLS AS WELL AS GREAT SORROW AND AS FOR SANCHICA THY DAUGHTER
THE LADIES IN BLACK WITHDREW AND THE DUCHESS GAVE ORDERS THAT FOR THE FUTURE THEY WERE NOT TO BE TREATED AS SERVANTS OF HERS BUT AS LADY ADVENTURERS WHO CAME TO HER HOUSE TO DEMAND JUSTICE
WHICH SHE SUSPECTED MUST BE VERY GOOD DON QUIXOTE SAID THAT TO GRATIFY THEM HE WOULD OPEN IT AND DID SO AND FOUND THAT IT RAN AS FOLLOWS TERESA PANZA'S LETTER TO HER HUSBAND SANCHO PANZA
THE WOMEN WOULD HAVE THEIR TEA AT SIX O'CLOCK AND SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET AWAY BEFORE SEVEN FROM BALLSBRIDGE TO THE PILLAR TWENTY MINUTES FROM THE PILLAR TO DRUMCONDRA TWENTY MINUTES AND TWENTY MINUTES TO BUY THE THINGS
AS THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL WAS NOW DRAWING NEAR AND HE HOPED TO WIN THERE THE SUIT OF ARMOUR WHICH IS THE PRIZE AT FESTIVALS OF THE SORT
AND THE SUB MATRON AND TWO OF THE BOARD LADIES HAD HEARD THE COMPLIMENT AND GINGER MOONEY WAS ALWAYS SAYING WHAT SHE WOULDN'T DO TO THE DUMMY WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE IRONS IF IT WASN'T FOR MARIA EVERYONE WAS SO FOND OF MARIA
AND FIXED SIX DAYS THENCE AS THE TIME THE COURTYARD OF THE CASTLE AS THE PLACE AND FOR ARMS THE CUSTOMARY ONES OF KNIGHTS LANCE AND SHIELD AND FULL ARMOUR
AND CAME BACK DRAGGING A LARGE BOX THEN THE MOTHER FROG TOOK A KEY THAT HUNG AROUND HER NECK ON A CHAIN AND OPENED THE BOX AND DREW FORTH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CARPET THAT WAS EVER SEEN
THEY LED HER UP TO THE TABLE AMID LAUGHING AND JOKING AND SHE PUT HER HAND OUT IN THE AIR AS SHE WAS TOLD TO DO SHE MOVED HER HAND ABOUT HERE AND THERE IN THE AIR AND DESCENDED ON ONE OF THE SAUCERS
MAKING MYSELF EQUAL WITH HIM AND ENABLING HIM TO ENTER INTO COMBAT WITH ME AND SO I CHALLENGE AND DEFY HIM THOUGH ABSENT ON THE PLEA OF HIS MALFEASANCE IN BREAKING FAITH WITH THIS POOR DAMSEL
EVIL TONGUES SAY SHE IS WITH CHILD BY HIM BUT HE DENIES IT STOUTLY
THE LETTERS WERE APPLAUDED LAUGHED OVER RELISHED AND ADMIRED AND THEN AS IF TO PUT THE SEAL TO THE BUSINESS THE COURIER ARRIVED BRINGING THE ONE SANCHO SENT TO DON QUIXOTE
SHE READ OUT AS FOLLOWS TERESA PANZA'S LETTER TO THE DUCHESS THE LETTER YOUR HIGHNESS WROTE ME MY LADY GAVE ME GREAT PLEASURE FOR INDEED I FOUND IT VERY WELCOME
NOT ONLY HOWEVER WAS HE UNABLE TO DISCOVER WHAT IT WAS BUT AS COUNTLESS DRUMS AND TRUMPETS NOW HELPED TO SWELL THE DIN OF THE BELLS AND SHOUTS HE WAS MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER
BUT ONE DAY AT TABLE WITH THE DUKE AND DUCHESS JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO CARRY HIS RESOLUTION INTO EFFECT AND ASK FOR THEIR PERMISSION LO AND BEHOLD SUDDENLY THERE CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE GREAT HALL TWO WOMEN
TO BE SURE HE HAS NOW LAID ASIDE HIS PAINT BRUSH AND TAKEN A SPADE IN HAND AND GOES TO THE FIELD LIKE A GENTLEMAN PEDRO LOBO'S SON HAS RECEIVED THE FIRST ORDERS
I GAVE YOU AN ACCOUNT OF THE INJUSTICE AND TREACHERY OF A WICKED FARMER TO MY DEARLY BELOVED DAUGHTER THE UNHAPPY DAMSEL HERE BEFORE YOU AND YOU PROMISED ME TO TAKE HER PART AND RIGHT THE WRONG THAT HAS BEEN DONE HER
ONLY SHE HOPED THAT JOE WOULDN'T COME IN DRUNK HE WAS SO DIFFERENT WHEN HE TOOK ANY DRINK OFTEN HE HAD WANTED HER TO GO AND LIVE WITH THEM BUT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT HERSELF IN THE WAY
AND GO TO COURT TO STRETCH MYSELF AT EASE IN A COACH
I HEREBY FOR THIS ONCE WAIVE MY PRIVILEGE OF GENTLE BLOOD AND COME DOWN AND PUT MYSELF ON A LEVEL WITH THE LOWLY BIRTH OF THE WRONG DOER
MARIA SUPERINTENDED THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BARMBRACK AND SAW THAT EVERY WOMAN GOT HER FOUR SLICES THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF LAUGHING AND JOKING DURING THE MEAL
FROM THE LIFTED THROAT CAME A LOW A VIBRANT CRY HARMONIOUS WEIRDLY DISQUIETING GOLDEN AND SWEET AND LADEN WITH THE EERY MINOR WAILINGS OF THE BLUE VALLEY'S NIGHT THE DRAGONED CHAMBER
IT WAS NO GLOBE IT WAS A WORLD OF MANY FACETS OF SMOOTH AND POLISHED PLANES
BEFORE MY EYES THEY TORTURED MY BROTHER NORHALA THEY WERE EVIL ALL EVIL NORHALA YOU DID WELL TO SLAY THEM SHE CAUGHT THE WOMAN'S HANDS PRESSED CLOSE TO HER
BUT THIS I DO KNOW ONLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER CAN THE BALANCE FALL AND IF IT BE ONE WAY THEN YOU AND WE SHALL HAVE RUTH BACK AND IF IT FALLS THE OTHER WAY THEN THERE WILL BE LITTLE NEED FOR US TO CARE FOR MAN WILL BE DONE MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
EVER THE ARMORED MEN FLED FROM IT AND EVER WAS IT SWIFTER THAN THEY TEETERING AT THEIR HEELS ON ITS TRIPOD LEGS FROM HALF ITS LENGTH THE DARTING SNAKE STREAMED RED RAIN I HEARD A SIGH FROM RUTH
A CHANCE GASPED VENTNOR BEHIND US WAS A WOLFLIKE YELPING THE FIRST PACK HAD RE FORMED HAD CROSSED THE BARRICADE THE DYNAMITE HAD MADE WAS RUSHING UPON US I RAN AS I HAD NEVER KNOWN I COULD
DOWN IT WAS POURING AN AVALANCHE OF MEN I CAUGHT THE GLINT OF HELMETS AND CORSELETS THOSE IN THE VAN WERE MOUNTED GALLOPING TWO ABREAST UPON SURE FOOTED MOUNTAIN PONIES THEIR SHORT SWORDS LIFTED HIGH FLICKERED
LOVER BROTHER OLD FRIEND RUTH CREPT CLOSER TO HER RESTED HER HEAD UPON THE VIRGINAL ROYAL BREASTS IT SHALL BE SO SHE MURMURED SISTER IT SHALL BE SO NORHALA I AM TIRED NORHALA I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF MEN
THEY SLICED INTO THE CLOSE PACKED FORWARD RANKS OF THE ARMORED MEN CUT OUT OF THEM TWO GREAT GAPS SICKENED I SAW FRAGMENTS OF MAN AND HORSE FLY ANOTHER ARM JAVELINED FROM ITS PLACE LIKE A FLYING SNAKE CLICKED AT THE END OF ANOTHER
BEFORE THE CRY HAD CEASED THERE POURED WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS OUT OF THE CREVICE SCORE UPON SCORE OF THE METAL THINGS THE FISSURES VOMITED THEM
BUT YOU AND I LITTLE SISTER WILL DWELL TOGETHER IN THE VASTNESSES IN THE PEACE SHALL IT NOT BE SO WITH NO FALTERING WITH NO GLANCE TOWARD US THREE
WERE THEY MADDENED BY FEAR DRIVEN BY DESPAIR DETERMINED TO SLAY BEFORE THEY THEMSELVES WERE SLAIN I DO NOT KNOW BUT THOSE WHO STILL LIVED OF THE MEN FROM THE TUNNEL MOUTH WERE CHARGING US THEY CLUSTERED CLOSE THEIR SHIELDS HELD BEFORE THEM
WRESTED MY GAZE FROM THE HOLLOW TURNED SHE LAY FAINTING IN DRAKE'S ARMS BESIDE THE TWO THE SWATHED WOMAN STOOD LOOKING OUT UPON THAT SLAUGHTER CALM AND STILL SHROUDED WITH AN UNEARTHLY TRANQUILLITY
A HARE SAT UPRIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANCIENT ROADWAY THE VALLEY ITSELF LAY SERENELY UNDER THE AMBERING LIGHT SMILING PEACEFUL EMPTIED OF HORROR
AND AS THEY ROSE STEADILY THEY DREW LIFE FROM THE CLEAR RADIANCE SUMMONING DREW CLOSER TO THE SEMBLANCE OF THAT TRANQUIL SPIRIT WHICH HER VENGEANCE HAD BANISHED
WE'VE SAVED RUTH ANYWAY HE SAID DRAKE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THAT HOLE IN THE WALL HE'S GOT LOTS OF AMMUNITION ON THE PONY BUT THEY'VE GOT US ANOTHER WILD SHOUTING DOWN SWEPT THE PACK
AND IN THAT FACE ALTHOUGH AS YET I COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT THE EYES I SENSED SOMETHING UNEARTHLY GOD WHISPERED VENTNOR WHAT IS SHE
REVELATIONS I KNOW NOT WHAT TO CALL THEM AND THOUGH EACH SEEMED EQUALLY REAL OF TWO OF THEM ONLY ONE I THINK CAN BE TRUE AND OF THE THIRD THAT MAY SOME TIME BE TRUE BUT SURELY IS NOT YET THROUGH THE AIR CAME A LOUDER DRUM ROLL
WE DROPPED UPON OUR KNEES SENT SHOT AFTER SHOT INTO THEM THEY FELL BACK HESITATED WE SPRANG UP SPED ON ALL TOO SHORT WAS THE CHECK BUT ONCE MORE WE HELD THEM AND AGAIN NOW RUTH AND DICK WERE A SCANT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE CREVICE I SAW HIM STOP
FROM NORHALA OF COURSE I LOOKED FOR NO PERCEPTION OF ANY OF THIS BUT FROM RUTH MY REACTION GREW
I THOUGHT THAT SHIN JE WAS ABOUT TO SLAY US HE WHISPERED FEAR BLINDED ME HIS HEAD DROPPED HIS BODY QUIVERED LAY STILL WE AROSE LOOKED ABOUT US DAZEDLY
A SHINING ANGLED PILLAR THAT THOUGH RIGID IMMOBILE SEEMED TO CROUCH BE INSTINCT WITH LIVING FORCE STRIVING TO BE UNLEASHED TWO GREAT GLOBES SURMOUNTED IT
AGAIN HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD RECOILED AS THOUGH SWEPT BACK BY AN INVISIBLE ARM FELL AGAINST US AND WAS CLASPED AND HELD BY VENTNOR AND AS HE STRUGGLED THE THING WE RODE HALTED
FELL FAR SHORT DON'T LOOK BACK GRUNTED VENTNOR STRETCH YOURSELF WALTER THERE'S A SURPRISE COMING HOPE TO GOD I JUDGED THE TIME RIGHT WE TURNED OFF THE RUINED WAY
VIEWING IT IT CAME TO ME WITH EYES IMPERSONAL COLD INDIFFERENT AS THE UNTROUBLED STARS WHICH LOOK DOWN UPON HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE IN THIS WORLD OF OURS THERE WAS A RUSHING OF MANY FEET AT OUR LEFT A WAIL FROM CHIU MING
THEY SWIRLED EDDIED AND FORMED A BARRICADE BETWEEN US AND THE ARMORED MEN DOWN UPON THEM POURED A SHOWER OF ARROWS FROM THE SOLDIERS I HEARD THE SHOUTS OF THEIR CAPTAINS THEY RUSHED THEY HAD COURAGE THOSE MEN YES AGAIN CAME THE WOMAN'S CRY
BEFORE WE HAD GONE HALF WAY AS THOUGH OUR FLIGHT HAD BROKEN WHATEVER BONDS HAD BOUND THEM A CLAMOR AROSE FROM THE HOST A WILD SHOUTING A CLANGING OF SWORDS ON SHIELDS I SHOT A GLANCE BEHIND THEY WERE IN MOTION ADVANCING SLOWLY
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE DRUMS OF DESTINY SLOWLY WE DESCENDED THAT MOUNT OF DESOLATION LINGERINGLY AS THOUGH THE BROODING EYES OF NORHALA WERE NOT YET SATED WITH DESTRUCTION
HE REACHED OUT TOUCHED ME YOU'RE RIGHT WALTER HE GRINNED IT DOES SEEM LIKE CARRYING COALS TO NEWCASTLE
AS LADY EVERSLEIGH PACED THE TERRACES OF AN ITALIAN GARDEN HER MOTHER BY HER SIDE WITH GERTRUDE CLINGING TO HER SIDE AS SHE LOOKED OUT OVER THE VAST DOMAIN WHICH OWNED HER AS MISTRESS
NOT TO RETURN FOR THREE YEARS BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE HE SAW LADY EVERSLEIGH AND HER MOTHER AND ESTABLISHED WITH THEM A BOND OF FRIENDSHIP AS CLOSE AS THAT OF THEIR KIN HE PROVIDED LIBERALLY FOR MISS BREWER
WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AGAIN SHE WAS LYING IN SIDNEY GRAHAM'S ARMS WITH HER HEAD AGAINST HIS SHOULDER FEELING OH SO COMFORTABLE AND TIRED THERE WERE TWO AUTOMOBILES WITH POWERFUL HEADLIGHTS STANDING BETWEEN THE TREES AND A LOT OF POLICEMEN IN THE SHADOWY BACKGROUND
AS FINE AS YOU COULD BE TO ME UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I SUPPOSE I THANK YOU FOR THAT THE MAN MET HER GAZE FOR AN INSTANT A FLIPPANT REPLY UPON HIS LIPS BUT CHECKED IT AND DROPPING HIS EYES WAS SILENT
HE FLED FROM A COUNTRY IN WHICH HIS NAME HAD BECOME ODIOUS AND TOOK UP HIS ABODE IN PARIS WHERE HE FOUND A MISERABLE LODGING IN ONE OF THE NARROWEST ALLEYS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE LUXEMBOURG WHICH WAS THEN A LABYRINTH OF NARROW STREETS AND LANES
HERE HE COULD AFFORD TO BUY BRANDY FOR AT THAT DATE BRANDY WAS MUCH CHEAPER IN FRANCE THAN IT IS NOW HERE HE COULD INDULGE HIS GROWING PROPENSITY FOR STRONG DRINK TO THE UTTERMOST EXTENT OF HIS MEANS AND COULD DROWN HIS SORROWS
HE KNEW HIMSELF TO BE THE WRETCH AND OUTCAST HE WAS AND LOOKING BACK AT HIS START IN LIFE HE COULD BUT REMEMBER HOW DIFFERENT HIS CAREER MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAD HE SO CHOSEN IN THOSE HOURS THE SLOW TEARS MADE FURROWS IN HIS HAGGARD CHEEKS
IT MIGHT SEEM THAT FORTUNE HAD LAVISHED HER FAIREST GIFTS INTO THE LAP OF HER WHO HAD BEEN ONCE A FRIENDLESS STRANGER SINGING IN THE TAVERNS OF WAPPING WONDERFUL INDEED HAD BEEN THE TRANSITIONS WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HER
IT WOULDN'T BE YOUR FAULT YOU COULDN'T HAVE HELPED IT OH YES I COULD AND I OUGHT I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET THE DRIVER TURN AROUND I SHOULD HAVE GOT OUT OF THAT CAR AND WAITED AT THE STATION AS MISTER BARNARD TOLD ME TO DO TILL HE CAME
DOUGLAS DALE COULD NOT ATTEND THAT INQUEST HE WAS STRICKEN DOWN WITH FEVER THE FATE OF THE WOMAN HE HAD SO LOVED SO UNJUSTLY SUSPECTED NEARLY COST HIM HIS LIFE AND WHEN HE RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY HE LEFT ENGLAND
I DO HOPE YOU HAVEN'T SUFFERED TOO MUCH INCONVENIENCE SHIRLEY SMILED UP AT HIM FROM HER SHOULDER OF REFUGE AS FROM A DREAM IT WAS ALL SO AMUSING AND IMPOSSIBLE AFTER WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH IT COULDN'T BE REAL
A SUDDEN FLICKER OF TRIUMPH PASSED OVER THE FACES OF THE FETTERED MAN AND THE BOY LIKE A RIPPLE OVER STILL WATER AND DIED AWAY INTO UNINTELLIGENCE BUT SHIRLEY'S VOICE RIPPLED FORTH IN A GLAD CLEAR LAUGH AS SHE ANSWERED JOYOUSLY
AS IF HE HOPED EVEN YET TO ESCAPE TWO OTHER MEN WITH HAWK LIKE FACES THAT SHE HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE WERE THERE ALSO MANACLED AND WITH EYES OF SMOULDERING FIRES CLIMBING EXCITEDLY OUT OF ONE OF THE BIG CARS CAME MISTER BARNARD
WAS THAT GOD HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HE HAD BEEN REMEMBERING ALL THE TIME AND SENT HIS HELP BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE JUST AS SHE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG HE MUST DO BECAUSE HE HAD PROMISED TO CARE FOR HIS OWN AND SHE WAS ONE OF HIS LITTLE ONES
A CHANGELESS ROUTINE UNBROKEN BY ONE BRIGHT INTERVAL ONE FRIENDLY VISIT ONE SIGN OR TOKEN TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS ANY LINK BETWEEN THIS LONELY WRETCH AND THE REST OF HUMANITY ONE DAY THE PORTER
AND THE BARONET HAD PASSED UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM SLEEP TO DEATH HE HAD DIED AND NO ONE HAD BEEN AWARE OF HIS DEATH THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE DID NOT KNOW EITHER HIS NAME OR HIS COUNTRY HIS BURIAL WAS THAT OF AN UNKNOWN PAUPER
AND THE BONES OF THE LAST MALE SCION OF THE HOUSE OF EVERSLEIGH
AND SHALL I MEET HER AMONG THE BLEST IN HEAVEN HE ASKS HIMSELF SOMETIMES AND THEN HE REMEMBERS THE HOLY WORDS OF COMFORT UNSPEAKABLE COME UNTO ME YE THAT ARE WEARY AND HEAVY LADEN AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST
MUSIC HATH CHARMS TO SOOTHE THE SAVAGE BREAST AND WONDERING IF PERHAPS THERE WERE NOT REALLY SOMETHING IN IT IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN IN SUCH A TERRIFYING SITUATION SHE WOULD REALLY HAVE ENJOYED THE CHARACTER STUDY THAT THIS VIEW OF THOSE TWO FACES AFFORDED HER AS SHE SAT IN THE SHADOW PLAYING SOFTLY
BUT HER RESCUE FROM POVERTY BROUGHT HER NO HAPPINESS SHE WAS A BROKEN HEARTED WOMAN VICTOR CARRINGTON'S MOTHER RETIRED INTO A CONVENT AND WAS PROBABLY AS HAPPY AS SHE HAD EVER BEEN SHE HAD LOVED HIM BUT LITTLE
SO YOU SEE IT WAS MY FAULT SHE DROOPED HER HEAD FORWARD AND RESTED HER CHIN DEJECTEDLY ON THE PALM OF HER HAND HER ELBOW ON HER KNEE THE MAN STOOD LOOKING AT HER FOR A SECOND IN HALF INDIGNANT ASTONISHMENT
BRING IN THEM THINGS FROM THE CUPBOARD AND LET'S GET TO WORK SHIRLEY DECLINED TO COME TO THE TABLE WHEN AT LAST THE REPAST WAS READY SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT HUNGRY IN FACT THE SMELL OR THE CRACKERS AND CHEESE AND PICKLES AND DRIED BEEF SICKENED HER SHE FELT TOO HYSTERICAL TO TRY TO EAT
SHE TRIPPED ON A ROOT AND STUMBLED TO HER KNEES BRUISING THEM PAINFULLY BUT HER ONLY THOUGHT WAS ONE OF JOY THAT HER SHOES HAD NOT COME OFF THE MAN SWORE A FEARFUL OATH UNDER HIS BREATH THEN SNATCHED HER UP AND BEGAN TO RUN WITH HER IN HIS ARMS
WHILE SIR REGINALD EVERSLEIGH DRAGGED OUT THE WRETCHED REMNANT OF HIS EXISTENCE IN A DINGY PARISIAN ALLEY THERE WAS PERFECT PEACE AND TRANQUIL HAPPINESS FOR THE WOMAN AGAINST WHOSE FAIR FAME HE AND VICTOR CARRINGTON HAD SO BASELY CONSPIRED YES
EXTRACTING THE PRECIOUS NOTES COUNTING OVER THE PAGES AND PUTTING THEM ECSTATICALLY INTO HIS POCKET NO ONE OF THAT GROUP BUT SHIRLEY COULD FULLY APPRECIATE THE LUDICROUS PICTURE HE MADE YOU ARE ENTIRELY SURE THAT NO ONE BUT YOURSELF HAS SEEN THESE NOTES
BUT THAT WON'T MAKE ANY BEANS FOR YOU IT WON'T TAKE YOU NO TIME TO WRITE EM OVER AGAIN IF HE GIVES YOU A COPY SOMEHOW IT PENETRATED THROUGH SHIRLEY'S TIRED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE MAN WAS TRYING TO BE KIND TO HER HE WAS PITYING HER AND OFFERING HER A WAY OUT OF HER SUPPOSED DILEMMA
THE PORTRESS AFTER HAVING ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HER MISTRESS WAS AT HOME OPENED THE FOLDING DOORS OF A ROOM TO THE LEFT AND HAVING USHERED ME IN CLOSED THEM BEHIND ME I FOUND MYSELF IN A SALON
AND THE OLD MAN WENT ON WITH A SHAKE OF HIS HEAD HE'LL COME HE SAID TO HIMSELF OH HE'LL COME THAT VERY POINT HALE WAS DEBATING WITH HIMSELF AS HE UNAVAILINGLY CAST HIS MINNOW INTO THE SWIFT WATER AND SLOWLY WOUND IT IN AGAIN
FOR I AM NOT EASILY EMBARRASSED I COMMENCED THE CONVERSATION BY REMARKING ON THE PLEASANT ASPECT OF HER LITTLE CABINET
THROUGH WHICH I SAW SHRUBS AND A GRASS PLAT LOOKING PLEASANT IN THE SUNSHINE OF THE MILD SPRING EVENING FOR IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF APRIL THIS THEN WAS MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN BUT I HAD NOT TIME TO LOOK LONG
SHE WOULD GET A SCOLDING AND MAYBE SOMETHING WORSE FROM HER STEP MOTHER AND ALL THAT TROUBLE AND RISK FOR NOTHING BUT SMOKE SO SHE LAY BACK AND RESTED HER LITTLE MOUTH TIGHTENING FIERCELY
WITH A VERY WELL PAINTED HIGHLY VARNISHED FLOOR CHAIRS AND SOFAS COVERED WITH WHITE DRAPERIES A GREEN PORCELAIN STOVE WALLS HUNG WITH PICTURES IN GILT FRAMES A GILT PENDULE AND OTHER ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE
THE BOY WAS USING THE SWITCH AS A GOAD AND DRIVING THE FROG AS AN OX AND HE WAS AS EARNEST AS THOUGH BOTH WERE REAL I GIVE YE A LITTLE REST NOW BUCK HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD EARNESTLY
THE STEADY EYES LEAPED ANGRILY BUT THERE WAS STILL NO ANSWER AND HE BENT TO TAKE THE FISH OFF HIS HOOK PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW TURNED HIS BACK AND TOSSED IT INTO THE POOL HIT HAIN'T HE LOOKED UP AGAIN
COME TO THE WINDOW AND TAKE A BETTER VIEW I FOLLOWED HER SHE OPENED THE SASH AND LEANING OUT I SAW IN FULL THE ENCLOSED DEMESNE WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN TO ME AN UNKNOWN REGION IT WAS A LONG
HER EYES GOT BIG WITH WONDER TAKE IT TO PIECES AND MAKE IT INTO A LONG LIMBER ROD IN A MOMENT HE HAD CAST A MINNOW INTO THE POOL AND WADED OUT INTO THE WATER UP TO HIS HIPS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO QUEER A FISHING POLE SO QUEER A FISHERMAN
AND HER DEEP EYES FIXED ON THE SMOKE IN THE VALLEY BELOW HER BREATH WAS STILL COMING FAST BETWEEN HER PARTED LIPS THERE WERE TINY DROPS ALONG THE ROOTS OF HER SHINING HAIR FOR THE CLIMB HAD BEEN STEEP
SHE'D BETTER GO HOME NOW BUT THE PATH HAD A SNAKE LIKE CHARM FOR HER AND STILL SHE STOOD FOLLOWING IT AS FAR DOWN AS SHE COULD WITH HER EYES DOWN IT WENT
FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS SILENCE AND A PUZZLED FROWN GATHERED ON THE MOUNTAINEER'S FACE THAT'S A BRIGHT LITTLE GIRL OF YOURS
HIS LINE RANG SUDDENLY JACK SHE CRIED YOU GOT A BITE HE PULLED MISSED THE STRIKE AND WOUND IN THE MINNOW WAS ALL RIGHT SO HE TOSSED IT BACK AGAIN THAT ISN'T YOUR NAME HE SAID
WHEN YOU GIT THROUGH FISHIN COME UP TO THE HOUSE RIGHT UP THE CREEK THAR AN I'LL GIVE YE A DRAM THANK YOU SAID THE FISHERMAN STIFFLY AND THE MOUNTAINEER TURNED SILENTLY AWAY AT THE EDGE OF THE BUSHES HE LOOKED BACK THE STRANGER WAS STILL FISHING
HE WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND HE WOULD GO UP AND SEE THE LITTLE GIRL AND THE GIANT AGAIN AND GET THAT PROMISED DRAM ONCE MORE HOWEVER HE LET HIS MINNOW FLOAT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW OF A BIG ROCK
WHO IS A MARRIED MAN OF NEAR FIFTY I REMARKED THAT I HOPED SHE WOULD FIND ME WORTHY OF HER GOOD OPINION THAT IF I KNEW MYSELF I WAS INCAPABLE OF BETRAYING ANY CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN ME DU RESTE SAID SHE
HALF HIDDEN BY WILLOWS AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND A TURN IN THE PATH BROUGHT INTO VIEW A LOG CABIN WELL CHINKED WITH STONES AND PLASTER AND WITH A WELL BUILT PORCH A FENCE RAN AROUND THE YARD
WHEN I HAD TAKEN A VIEW OF HER WELL TRIMMED BEDS AND BUDDING SHRUBBERIES I ALLOWED MY GLANCE TO COME BACK TO HERSELF NOR DID I HASTILY WITHDRAW IT
AND HAD BROUGHT BACK WONDERFUL STORIES OF THAT OUTER WORLD AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER GO INTO IT AND SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT WAS THERE WITH THE THOUGHT SHE ROSE SLOWLY TO HER FEET
IN THE ROAD ACROSS THE CREEK WAS A CHUBBY TOW HAIRED BOY WITH A LONG SWITCH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND A PINE DAGGER AND A STRING IN HIS LEFT ATTACHED TO THE STRING AND TIED BY ONE HIND LEG WAS A FROG
HE LIKED THAT AND HER HAIR IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE GOLD BRONZE ON THE WING OF A WILD TURKEY THAT HE HAD SHOT THE DAY BEFORE WELL IT WAS NOON NOW THE FISH HAD STOPPED BITING AFTER THE WAYWARD FASHION OF BASS
AND WITH THE SORT OF TRANQUILLITY OBVIOUS IN ALL SHE DID A TRANQUILLITY WHICH SOOTHED AND SUITED ME SINGULARLY AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THAT EVENING BRUSSELS SEEMED A VERY PLEASANT PLACE TO ME WHEN I GOT OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREET
LIKE A CROUCHED PANTHER CUB LOOKING DOWN FOR A MOMENT ALL THAT WAS HUMAN SEEMED GONE FROM HER EYES BUT AS SHE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS LOST CAME BACK TO THEM
PRETTY HER FEATURES WERE NOT NOR VERY SOFT NOR VERY REGULAR BUT NEITHER WERE THEY IN ANY DEGREE PLAIN AND I ALREADY SAW CAUSE TO DEEM THEM EXPRESSIVE WHAT WAS THEIR PREDOMINANT CAST
NOW BOTH MAN AND HORSE HAD STOPPED THE STRANGER HAD TAKEN OFF HIS GRAY SLOUCHED HAT AND HE WAS WIPING HIS FACE WITH SOMETHING WHITE SOMETHING BLUE WAS TIED LOOSELY ABOUT HIS THROAT
THE LITTLE CREATURE DROPPED OF A SUDDEN TO THE GROUND AND LIKE SOMETHING WILD LAY FLAT A HUMAN FIGURE HAD FILLED THE LEAFY MOUTH THAT SWALLOWED UP THE TRAIL AND IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
WOULD ALWAYS REEL OFF A ROUND HUNDRED OF GRAPHIC VERSES UNIMPEACHABLE IN SCANSION CLARENCE WAS OF DEGENERATE MOULD HE COLLAPSED ON TO A CHAIR AND SAT THERE GASPING AND HIS RECOVERY WAS RATHER DELAYED THAN HASTENED BY HIS MOTHER
BUT GREAT THINGS WERE STILL GREAT AND FAIR THINGS STILL FAIR WITH NO THOUGHT FOR THE WORLD'S OPINION HAD THESE MEN GONE DOWN TO THE WATER TO DAY
WITH MURDERS AND ALL MANNER OF GRIM THINGS SHE HAD NOT HAD EDUCATION ENOUGH TO SPOIL HER NERVE SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE ROUGH WITH THE SMOOTH SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE ALL LIFE FOR HER PROVINCE AND DEATH TOO THE DUKE WAS DEAD
VENGEANCE WAS HIS AND YES THERE HE SAID IS THE INELUCTABLE HARD FACT YOU WAKE TO THE OWLS HAVE HOOTED THE GODS HAVE SPOKEN
TOOK SOME PAPERS FROM HIS BREAST POCKET AND SELECTING ONE OF THEM HANDED IT TO HER IT WAS THE TELEGRAM SENT BY HIS STEWARD SHE READ IT WITH A STERN JOY HE WATCHED HER READING IT WILD EYED SHE LOOKED UP FROM IT TO HIM
THEY KNEW THESE TWO YET IN THEIR HAPPINESS ROSE AND FLOATED A SHADOW BETWEEN THEM IT WAS THE GHOST OF THAT ONE MAN WHO THEY KNEW HAD DIED IRRELEVANTLY WITH A COLD HEART
IF I DO I SHALL SEND FOR A POLICEMAN SHE LOOKED WELL AT HIM YES SHE SLOWLY SAID I THINK YOU WOULD DO THAT SHE TOOK HER THINGS FROM HIM AND LAID THEM BY THE MIRROR
SOFTLY SHE STROKED THE CARPET WITH THE PALMS OF HER HANDS HAPPY CARPET SHE CROONED AYE HAPPY THE VERY WOMEN THAT WOVE THE THREADS THAT ARE TROD BY THE FEET OF MY BELOVED MASTER BUT HARK
SAID MISSUS BATCH KATIE WENT ACROSS AND LAID A GENTLE HAND ON HER MOTHER'S SHOULDER THIS HOWEVER DID BUT EVOKE A FRESH FLOOD OF TEARS MISSUS BATCH HAD A KEEN SENSE OF THE DEPORTMENT OWED TO TRAGEDY
SOMEWHAT AS WHEN BENEATH THE STARS THE GREAT TENT HAD BEEN STRUCK AND THE LIONS WERE GROWLING IN THEIR VANS AND THE HORSES WERE PAWING THE STAMPED GRASS AND WHINNYING AND THE ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING
ZULEIKA LOOKED AT THE CASKET AND THEN VERY GRATEFULLY AT THE MAID HER ART HOW HAD SHE FORGOTTEN THAT HERE WAS SOLACE PURPOSE SHE WOULD WORK AS SHE HAD NEVER WORKED YET
THE DUKE LOOKED SEARCHINGLY AT HER YOU MEAN THAT YOU NOW WISH TO RELEASE ME FROM MY PROMISE RELEASE YOU AS IF YOU WERE EVER BOUND DON'T TORTURE ME HE WONDERED WHAT DEEP GAME SHE WAS PLAYING
AND HE TOLD HOW BY INQUIRIES FURTHER DOWN THE RIVER HE HAD LEARNED THE EXTENT OF THE DISASTER
I MAY FIND THAT WHAT I HAD TAKEN TO BE A GREAT INDIFFERENCE IS NOTHING BUT A VERY SMALL HATE AH I HAVE WOUNDED YOU FORGIVE ME A WEAK WOMAN TALKING AT RANDOM IN HER WRETCHEDNESS
OH JOHN JOHN IF I THOUGHT YOU SMALL MY LOVE WOULD BUT TAKE ON THE CROWN OF PITY DON'T FORBID ME TO CALL YOU JOHN I LOOKED YOU UP IN DEBRETT WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR YOU THAT SEEMED TO BRING YOU NEARER TO ME SO MANY OTHER NAMES YOU HAVE TOO
NOW SHE SAW AGAIN THAT HIGHER WINDOW
THE LIGHT DIED OUT OF HER EYES AND HER FACE GREW RIGID THAT MEMORY HAD BROUGHT OTHER MEMORIES IN ITS WAKE FOR HER WHEN SHE FLED THE BROAD
WHEN HER BETROTHED HAD SAVED ENOUGH TO START A LITTLE CAFE OF HIS OWN AND MAKE HER HIS BRIDE AND DAME DE COMPTOIR OH TO HAVE A PURPOSE A PROSPECT A STAKE IN THE WORLD AS THIS FAITHFUL SOUL HAD
THE POOR GHOSTS OF THEM WHO HAD DONE WHAT THEY COULD AND COULD DO NO MORE NO MORE WAS IT NOT ENOUGH
AND WENT HEAVILY UP THE STAIRS HER MIND SCAMPERING AGAIN BEFORE HER IF HE WAS SAFE AND SOUND DEAR YOUNG GENTLEMAN HEAVEN BE PRAISED AND SHE WOULD BREAK THE AWFUL NEWS TO HIM VERY GRADUALLY
BUT CREDIBILITY IS NOT ENOUGH FOR CLIO'S SERVANT I AIM AT TRUTH AND SO AS I BY MY ZEUS GIVEN INCORPOREITY WAS THE ONE PERSON WHO HAD A GOOD VIEW OF THE SCENE AT LARGE
BLACK AND PINK WERE THEY NOT WHEN YOU TOOK THEM OF COURSE
MISSUS BATCH REPEATED DULLY KATIE SHE SAID IN THE SAME VOICE GET UP THIS INSTANT BUT KATIE DID NOT HEAR HER THE MOTHER WAS LOTH TO HAVE BEEN OUTDONE IN SENSIBILITY BY THE DAUGHTER
THE MAID HASTENED TO HER SIDE AND WITH QUICK LIGHT FINGERS BEGAN TO UNDRESS HER MADEMOISELLE VA BIEN DORMIR
SHINY BLACK PORTFOLIOS WITH WEEKLY JOURNALS IN THEM YELLOW STAVES WITH DAILY JOURNALS FLAPPING FROM THEM
TO THE TONE OF THAT VOICE TO THAT HAND WHICH SHE HAD KISSED TO THE TOUCH OF THOSE LIPS ON HER BROW TO THE DOOR STEP SHE HAD MADE SO WHITE FOR HIM DAY BY DAY THE SOUND OF THE RAIN HAD LONG CEASED THERE WAS THE NOISE OF A GATHERING WIND
WHEN I UNDRESSED THEY MUST HAVE ROLLED ON TO THE CARPET
WERE THEY NOT SISTERS RELENTINGLY THEN PITYINGLY EACH OF THE TWO COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND THERE RECURRED AS BY STEALTH TO THE LADY IN THE ROOM A THOUGHT THAT HAD ASSAILED HER NOT LONG AGO IN JUDAS STREET
THAT WHICH TOLD HIM HE WAS TRULY LOVED
SHE MURMURED THAT WAS ALL OVER
SINCE YOU WON'T KILL ME ALWAYS I SHALL FOLLOW YOU ON MY KNEES THUS
AS SHE DESCENDED THE LAST FLIGHT OF STAIRS HER DAUGHTER HAD JUST SHUT THE FRONT DOOR AND WAS COMING ALONG THE HALL POOR MISTER NOAKS HE'S GONE SAID THE MOTHER HAS HE
HER GRIEF WAS PERFECTLY SINCERE AND IT WAS NOT THE LESS SO BECAUSE WITH IT WAS MINGLED A CERTAIN JOY IN THE GREATNESS OF THE CALAMITY SHE CAME OF GOOD SOUND PEASANT STOCK ABIDING IN HER
NEVER DID SEE HER AMONG HER OWN KIND OF FOLKS TILL NOW I WISH I COULD JABBER ABOUT MUSIC AND STUFF I'LL LEARN IT I WILL I CAN I PICKED UP AUTOS IN THREE MONTHS I MILT YOU'RE A DUB
BOWS TO EVERY MAIDEN AUNT IN THE SHOP NOW IF I WAS FOLLOWING HER I'D NEVER SEE ANYBODY BUT HER REST OF THE FOLKS COULD ALL BOB THEIR HEADS SILLY AND I'D NEVER SEE ONE BLAME THING EXCEPT THAT FUNNY LITTLE SOFT SPOT AT THE BACK OF HER NECK NOPE
SHE HAD DISCOVERED TOO THAT SHE COULD ADVENTURE NO LONGER WAS SHE HAUNTED BY THE APPREHENSION THAT HAD WHISPERED TO HER AS SHE HAD LEFT MINNEAPOLIS SHE KNEW A THRILL WHEN SHE HAILED AS THOUGH IT WERE A PASSING SHIP
I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S BAD FOR YOU DADDY BUT ISN'T IT TAKING YOUR MIND AWAY FROM BUSINESS YE ES I THINK IT IS ANYWAY WE'LL TRY IT A FEW DAYS MORE I FANCY WE CAN STAND UP UNDER THE STRAIN AND PERILS
IT WAS TOO QUICK TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED THE BUG HEADED DIRECTLY TOWARD THE EDGE OF THE ROAD SHOT OUT WENT DOWN THE EMBANKMENT OVER AND OVER IT LAY ABSURDLY UPSIDE DOWN ITS MUFFLER AND BRAKE RODS SHOWING IN PLACE OF THE SEAT AND HOOD
HE DOESN'T NEED ANY PISTON RINGS THAT LAD WONDER WONDER WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT MUSIC I GUESS AND BOOKS AND PICTURES AND SCENERY HE'S SAYING THAT NO TONGUE OR PEN CAN DESCRIBE THE GLORIES OF THE PARK AND THEN HE'S TRYING TO DESCRIBE EM
WAS LIKE THE SENSATION OF STREET SIGNS IN A NEW LANGUAGE AND WHEN SHE FOUND A GOOD HOTEL IN FARGO AND HAD A REAL BATH SHE FELT THAT BY HER OWN EFFORTS SHE HAD EARNED THE RIGHT TO ENJOY IT
WHICH SEEMED TO PUSH THE CAR DOWN AGAIN BESIDE THEM THE MOUNTAIN WOODS WERE SACREDLY QUIET WITH FERN AND LILY AND GREEN LIT SPACES THEY CAME OUT IN A CLEARING BEFORE DUSK BESIDE THE CLEARING WAS A BROOK WITH A CRUDE CRADLE
THE MESSAGE WAS FROM JEFF SAXTON IN BROOKLYN IT BROUGHT TO HER MIND THE STEADY SHINE OF HIS GLASSES THE MOST EXPENSIVE GLASSES WITH THE VERY BEST CURVED LENSES AS IT DEMANDED
YOU GOT A NICE CHARACTER MILT BUT YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANY PARTS OF SPEECH NOW LOOK AT PERCY TAKING A BATH IN A FINGER BOWL I NEVER COULD PULL THAT FINGER BOWL STUFF
SHE ROSE HUDDLING HER WRAPPER ABOUT HER BOSOM AS THEY DROVE INTO THE CLEARING AND PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH STUMPS AND BRIARS WHERE YOU FOLKS THINK YOU'RE GOING SHE WHIMPERED WHY WHY JUST
THEY DROVE FIVE MILES ALONG THE HIGHWAY THEN UP A TRAIL WHERE THE GOMEZ BRUSHED THE UNDERGROWTH ON EACH SIDE AS IT DESPERATELY DUG INTO MOSS RAIN GUTTED RUTS LOOSE ROCKS ALL ON A VICIOUS SLANT
I'LL GIVE UP MY TRIP TO STRUGGLE FOR YOUR SOUL HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOUL IN LARGE CHUNKS HE SEEMED TO TALK PRETTY PAINLESSLY I HAD A HUNCH YOU AND HE WERE DISCUSSING SCULPTURE ANYWAY MAYBE RODIN
PINKY PASSED IT SO CARELESSLY THAT WITH CRAWLING SPINE CLAIRE SAW THE OUTER WHEELS OF THE BUG ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE ROAD THE EDGE OF A FIFTY FOOT DROP
I DIDN'T MEAN YOU WERE A CAVEMAN YOU'RE MY BIG BROTHER
SHE TORE AT HER LOOSELY CAUGHT TARNISHED BLONDE HAIR CLAIRE KNELT BY HER YOU MUSTN'T YOU MUSTN'T WE'LL DAMN YOU WITH YOUR SMUG FACED HUSBAND THERE AND YOUR FINE AUTO AND ALL BUTTING INTO POOR FOLKS TROUBLES SHRIEKED DLORUS
BREECHES QUOTED AH TIS FAR HEAVEN MY AWED HEART SEEKS WHEN I BEHOLD THOSE MIGHTY PEAKS MILT COULD HEAR HIM COMMENTING DOESN'T THAT JUST GET THE FEELING OF THE GREAT OPEN MISS BOLTWOOD
ON AN AFTERNOON OF GLARE AND BRAZEN LOCUSTS THE FRESHNESS OF A SPRING MORNING A THOUSAND SLEWS A HUNDRED LAKES BORDERED WITH RIPPLING BARLEY OR TINKLING BELLS OF THE FLAX CLAIRE PASSED
APPARENTLY HE'S KEEPING GOING I REMEMBER HE'S HEADED FOR SEATTLE TOO WE'LL LOOK FOR HIM IN THE THEATER OH THE DARLING THERE'S HIS CAT WHAT WAS THE FUNNY NAME HE GAVE HER THE MARCHIONESS MONTMORENCY OR SOMETHING
THEN HE SLICKERED HIS HAIR AT ME AND MOOED IS IT NOT WONDERFUL TO SEE ALL THESE STRANGE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SECRETS OF NATURE AND I SAID IS IT AND HE WENT ON
THIS IS SO NICE WHERE'S YOUR CAR I HOPE NOTHING'S HAPPENED GLOWED CLAIRE NO IT'S BACK HERE FROM THE ROAD A PIECE CAMP THERE TONIGHT REASON I STOPPED STRUCK ME YOU'VE NEVER DONE ANY MOUNTAIN DRIVING
THEN I'LL TAG AFTER YOU TOMORROW AND SPEAK MY PIECE SO JOLLY YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE PARK YES THOUGHT MIGHT AS WELL WHAT THE GUIDE BOOKS CALL WONDERS OF NATURE
NO THANKS MUCH OBLIGED BUT GUESSED HE'D BETTER NOT ACCEPT HER INVITATION TO DINNER
CLAIRE STARTED FORWARD BUT MILT CAUGHT HER SLEEVE AND ADMIRED YOU WERE RIGHT YOU'VE GOT MORE NERVE THAN I HAVE NO I WOULDN'T DARE IF I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE WITH ME
MAGICALLY TELLING THE WAY FROM THE MISSISSIPPI TO THE PACIFIC HER FATHER'S OCCASIONAL MUSING TALK KEPT HER FROM LONELINESS HE WAS A GOOD TOURING COMPANION MOTORING IS NOT THE BEST OCCASION FOR EPIGRAMS SATIRE
MISTER BOLTWOOD CAUGHT HER ENTHUSIASM DINNER WAS A FESTIVAL AND IN ICED TEA THE PEACEFUL CONQUISTADORES DRANK THE TOAST OF THE NEW SPANISH MAIN AND AFTERWARD ARM IN ARM WENT CHATTERING TO THE MOVIES
SHE SEEMED CHARMED IF SHE HAD A PUNCTURE WHY SHE PUT ON THE SPARE IF SHE RAN OUT OF GAS WHY ANY PASSING DRIVER WOULD LEND HER A GALLON
MINE BABBLED MILT COURSE NOT
I GUESS THEY'D TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME I WAS BROUGHT UP NICE NO ROUGH HOUSE OR
BUT OH YOU KNOW YOU KNOW CAN YOU STAND GOING DOWN THERE I HATE TO HAVE YOU BUT YOU MAY BE NEEDED YES I'LL COME SHE WHISPERED THEIR CRAWL DOWN THE ROCK ROLLING EMBANKMENT SEEMED DESPERATELY SLOW WAIT HERE
SIX HUNDRED MILES OF ALMOST BARREN ROCK WITH OUTLYING UNCHARTED LEDGES WORN SMOOTH BY ICE ELSE STILL MORE VESSELS WOULD HAVE FOUND WRECKAGE THERE A SCANT CONSTANT POPULATION OF HARDY FISHERMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES
EVEN WHEN CUB HUNTING REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE HIS BED AT THREE A M HE WAS CONSTANT AT HIS KENNEL
BECAME ASSISTANT MASTER AT REPTON AND LATER WHEN HE MARRIED HEAD MASTER OF MOSTYN HOUSE SCHOOL A POSITION WHICH HE RESIGNED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO TO BECOME CHAPLAIN OF THE LONDON HOSPITAL HE WAS A MAN OF MUCH LEARNING WITH A KEEN INTEREST IN SCIENCE
TO WHOM CAN I APPLY TO APPOINT OTHERS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT VESTED INTERESTS MEAN LORD CHILTERN THEN NOBODY CAN MANAGE HIS OWN PROPERTY AS HE PLEASES NOBODY CAN UNLESS HE DOES THE WORK HIMSELF IF I WERE TO GO AND LIVE IN TRUMPETON WOOD I COULD DO IT BUT YOU SEE I HAVE TO LIVE HERE
AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL BE AFFLICTED WITH A WILD DISMAY ALL WHICH LORD CHILTERN UNDERSTOOD WELL WHEN HE BECAME SO LOUD IN HIS COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DUKE BUT OUR DEAR OLD FRIEND ONLY THE OTHER DAY A DUKE PLANTY PALL AS HE WAS LATELY CALLED
ON NOVEMBER NINTH OF THE PRECEDING YEAR THE KING OF ENGLAND GAVE ONE OF HIS BIRTHDAY HONORS TO THE SAME MAN MAKING HIM A COMPANION OF SAINT MICHAEL AND SAINT GEORGE C M G WILFRED THOMASON GRENFELL
A FEW DAYS LATER THREE MEN WERE CLOSETED IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TWO OF THEM WERE OFFICIALS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HIMSELF AND OUR OLD FRIEND THE INSPECTOR THE THIRD WAS THE DETECTIVE SWEETWATER CHOSEN BY THEM TO KEEP WATCH ON MISTER GREY SWEETWATER HAD JUST COME TO TOWN
WE MAY HAVE TRAPS IF WE LIKE IT LORD CHILTERN CERTAINLY ONLY SAY SO AND WE SHALL KNOW WHERE WE ARE HE LOOKED VERY ANGRY AND POOR LADY CHILTERN WAS COVERED WITH DISMAY THE DUKE CAN DESTROY THE HUNT IF HE PLEASES NO DOUBT SAID THE LORD BUT WE DON'T LIKE TRAPS LORD CHILTERN
WELLGOOD OR AS HE BELIEVED SEARS KNEW TOO MUCH OF LIFE TO BE BEGUILED BY ANY OPEN CLAP TRAP AND SWEETWATER WAS OBLIGED TO SEE HIM DRIVE OFF WITHOUT HAVING MADE THE LEAST ADVANCE IN THE PURPOSE ENGROSSING HIM BUT THAT WAS NOTHING HE HAD ALL THE EVENING BEFORE HIM
MOSTYN HOUSE SCHOOL STILL STANDS ENLARGED AND MODERNIZED IN THE CHARGE OF DOCTOR GRENFELL'S ELDER BROTHER AND IN IT HIS MOTHER IS STILL THE REAL HEAD AND CONTROLLING GENIUS PARKGATE
AS IT STANDS TO DAY THE MISSION TO DEEP SEA FISHERMEN WHICH DOCTOR GRENFELL REPRESENTS ADMINISTERS AND ANIMATES ON THE LABRADOR COAST NOT ONLY BRINGS HOPE NEW COURAGE AND SPIRITUAL COMFORT TO AN ISOLATED PEOPLE IN A DESOLATE LAND
HE HAD LEARNED AS SUCH FELLOWS DO
MOST NOBLE VICE CHANCELLOR AND YOU EMINENT PROCTORS A CITIZEN OF BRITAIN IS BEFORE YOU ONCE A STUDENT IN THIS UNIVERSITY NOW BETTER KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF THE NEW WORLD THAN TO OUR OWN
AND MANUFACTURES HIS OWN CONCOCTIONS IN A HOUSE HE HAS RENTED HERE ON A LONELY ROAD SOME HALF MILE OUT OF TOWN WELLGOOD DOES THE MAN NAMED WELLGOOD MISTER GREY EXCLAIMED WITH ALL THE ASTONISHMENT THE OTHER SECRETLY EXPECTED YES WELLGOOD JAMES WELLGOOD THERE IS NO OTHER IN TOWN
WHO BOARDED THE SPANISH ADMIRAL'S SHIP THE ESMERALDA ON THE PORT SIDE WHILE COCHRANE CAME UP ON THE STARBOARD WHEN TOGETHER THEY MADE SHORT WORK OF THE CAPTURE NOR HAS THE STRAIN DIED OUT AS IS DEMONSTRATED IN THE PRESENT GENERATION BY MANY OF DOCTOR GRENFELL'S COUSINS
THIS IS THE MAN WHO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WENT TO THE COAST OF LABRADOR TO SUCCOR WITH MEDICAL AID THE SOLITARY FISHERMEN OF THE NORTHERN SEA IN EXECUTING WHICH SERVICE HE DESPISED THE PERILS OF THE OCEAN WHICH ARE THERE MOST TERRIBLE
NOTHING SHORT OF AN EMBASSY ON BEHALF OF THE GREAT COVERTS OF HIS COUNTRY WOULD HAVE KEPT THIS MASTER AWAY AT PRESENT AND NOW HIS DIPLOMACY HAVING SUCCEEDED HE HURRIED BACK TO MAKE THE MOST OF ITS RESULTS LADY CHILTERN BEFORE SHE WENT MADE A LITTLE SPEECH TO PHINEAS FINN
AND A FINE CLASSICAL SCHOLAR WHOSE ELDER AND YOUNGER BROTHERS EACH FELT THE ANCESTRAL CALL OF THE SEA AND BECAME ADMIRALS WITH BRAVE RECORDS OF DARING AND SUCCESS DOCTOR GRENFELL'S FATHER AFTER A BRILLIANT CAREER AT RUGBY SCHOOL AND AT BALLIOL COLLEGE OXFORD
I VOTE THAT WE HAVE AN OFFICER OF STATE TO GO IN AND OUT WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITH A SEAT IN THE CABINET OR NOT ACCORDING AS THINGS GO
YOU'LL COME TO US IN THE WINTER MISTER FINN I SHOULD LIKE YOU MUST NO ONE WAS TRUER TO YOU THAN WE WERE YOU KNOW INDEED REGARDING YOU AS WE DO HOW SHOULD WE NOT HAVE BEEN TRUE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ME THAT MY OLD FRIEND SHOULD HAVE BEEN OH LADY CHILTERN
ANY MORE THAN A BEAR TO BE BAITED OR A BADGER TO BE DRAWN IN LET US SAY HIS LONDON DINING ROOM BUT A GOOD DEAL HAD BEEN SAID WHICH THOUGH NOT PERHAPS CAPABLE OF CONVINCING THE UNPREJUDICED AMERICAN OR FRENCHMAN HAD BEEN REGARDED AS COGENT ARGUMENTS TO COUNTRY BRED ENGLISHMEN
A COUPLE OF TERMS AT QUEEN'S COLLEGE OXFORD FOLLOWED THE LONDON EXPERIENCE BUT HERE THE CONDITIONS WERE TOO EASY AND LUXURIOUS FOR ONE WHO BY BOTH INHERITANCE AND TRAINING HAD WITHIN HIM THE INCENTIVE TO THE STRENUOUS LIFE NEED CALLED MISERY APPEALED
ON BOTH SIDES OF HIS INHERITANCE HAVE BEEN EXHIBITED THE COURAGE PATIENCE PERSISTENCE AND FIGHTING AND TEACHING QUALITIES WHICH ARE EXEMPLIFIED IN HIS OWN ABILITIES TO COMMAND TO ADMINISTER AND TO UPLIFT ON HIS FATHER'S SIDE WERE THE GRENVILLES
HE WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE GREAT LADS BRIGADES WHICH HAVE DONE MUCH GOOD AND FOSTERED MORE IN THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY HAVE SET FOR ALLIED ACTIVITIES NOR WERE THE NEEDS OF HIS OWN BODILY MACHINE NEGLECTED FOOTBALL ROWING AND THE TENNIS COURT KEPT HIM IN CONDITION
TO MAKE OF THE SCATTERED SETTLEMENTS A UNITED AND INDEPENDENT PEOPLE TO SAFEGUARD THEIR FUTURE BY SUCH MEASURES AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEAMEN'S INSTITUTE AT SAINT JOHN'S NEWFOUNDLAND AND THE INSURANCE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD
OF COURSE YOU'LL COME YOU OWE IT TO US TO COME AND MAY I SAY THIS IF THERE BE ANYBODY TO COME WITH YOU THAT WILL MAKE IT ONLY SO MUCH THE BETTER IF IT SHOULD BE SO OF COURSE THERE WILL BE LETTERS WRITTEN
BUT HE COULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE BROUGHT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH LORD CHILTERN AS TO THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OWN PROPERTY THE DUCHESS WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE MUST PREVENT ANY SUCH AWKWARDNESS AND SHE DID PREVENT IT AND NOW LORD CHILTERN SHE SAID HOW ABOUT THE FOXES
THE UTTER HELPLESSNESS OF THE MAN IN ALL PRACTICAL MATTERS AND HIS EXTREME ANXIETY TO SEE ALL THAT WAS GOING ON ABOUT HIM WITHOUT BEING HIMSELF SEEN THERE WAS METHOD IN THIS CURIOSITY TOO MUCH METHOD WOMEN DID NOT INTEREST HIM IN THE LEAST
BUT THE PASSING YEARS SAW US ENGAGED IN WIDELY AND CURIOUSLY DIVERGENT PHASES OF THE WORK THIRTY YEARS LATER I WAS PROFESSOR OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LANGUAGE AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND BENDA WAS MAINTENANCE ENGINEER OF THE BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY OF NEW YORK CITY
WE NO LONGER FELT IMPELLED TO SIGNAL ACROSS THE HOUSE TOPS WITH SEMAPHORES NOR TO DEVISE CIPHERS THAT WOULD DEFY SOLUTION BUT WE STILL KEPT UP OUR INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP AND OUR INTENSE INTEREST IN OUR BELOVED SUBJECT
FAR FROM SHORE AND DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER OF THE LAKE OF COURSE EVERY EYE WAS AT FIRST FIXED UPON THIS DOME WHERE OZMA AND DOROTHY AND THE SKEEZERS WERE STILL FAST PRISONERS BUT SOON THEIR ATTENTION WAS CAUGHT BY A MORE BRILLIANT SIGHT
WHO HAD BEEN AMONG THE EARLY GOLD SEEKERS AND TRIED ROUGHING IT IN THE MINES THOUGH A NATIVE OF RHODE ISLAND AND OF PURITAN ANCESTRY HE WAS QUITE WESTERN IN APPEARANCE THOUGH NOT A WEALTHY MAN
ONE WAS OUR PRETTY MISS SALLIE LEWIS WHO HAD THE DREAD DISEASE IN CONFLUENT FORM GRANDMA WAS CALLED HURRIEDLY IN THE NIGHT BECAUSE THE AFFLICTED GIRL IN DELIRIUM HAD LOOSENED THE STRAPS WHICH HELD HER UPON HER BED
IF WE GO TO THE MOUNTAIN SAID THE WIZARD WE MAY GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THAT WICKED SU DIC AND THEN WE WOULD BE DELAYED IN RESCUING OZMA AND DOROTHY SO I THINK OUR BEST PLAN WILL BE TO GO TO THE SKEEZER COUNTRY
BENDA AND I HAD BEEN ON THE MOST INTIMATE TERMS FOR FORTY YEARS HIS LETTERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN CRISP AND DIRECT AND THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR AND CONFIDENTIAL I DO NOT KNOW JUST HOW MANY LETTERS I RECEIVED FROM HIM FROM THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY BEFORE I NOTED THE DIFFERENCE
YET IT WAS BENDA WRITING THEM GRUFF LITTLE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS CLEAR WAYS OF LOOKING AT EVEN THE VERIEST TRIFLES LITTLE ALLUSION TO OUR COMMON PAST THESE THINGS COULD NEITHER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY ANYONE ELSE NOR WRITTEN UNDER COMPULSION FROM WITHOUT
THESE WERE SET CLOSELY TOGETHER THE BRANCHES WHICH CAME QUITE TO THE GROUND BEING SO TIGHTLY INTERLACED THAT EVEN THE GLASS CAT COULD SCARCELY FIND A PLACE TO SQUEEZE THROUGH THE PATH WHICH THE FLATHEADS USED WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY
HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES REPLIED THE SCARECROW
AT THE TIME OF WHICH I NOW SPEAK THE NOVELTY HAD WORN OFF AND NO ONE PAID ANY MORE ATTENTION TO IT THAN THEY DO TO ZION CITY OR THE DUNKARDS BY THIS TIME THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY WAS A CITY OF A MILLION INHABITANTS
RAISE THE SUNKEN ISLAND AND SAVE OUR FRIENDS AND THE IMPRISONED SKEEZERS AFTERWARD WE CAN VISIT THE MOUNTAIN AND PUNISH THE CRUEL MAGICIAN OF THE FLATHEADS THAT IS SENSIBLE APPROVED THE SHAGGY MAN I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU
IF IT WERE JUST AN ORDINARY SUNKEN ISLAND SAID THE POWERFUL SORCERESS THERE WOULD BE SEVERAL WAYS BY WHICH I MIGHT BRING IT TO THE SURFACE AGAIN BUT THIS IS A MAGIC ISLE
I WOULD GIVE A MONTH'S SALARY TO GET A LOOK AT THOSE LETTERS NOW BUT I NEGLECTED TO PRESERVE THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM BECAUSE I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER THEY EXHIBIT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUBSEQUENT LETTERS SOME OF WHICH I NOW HAVE AS I HAVE STATED
FOR WE ARE IN GREAT TROUBLE AND NEED ASSISTANCE IF YOU BELONG ON THE ISLAND WHY ARE YOU HERE DEMANDED GLINDA SO THEY TOLD HER ALL THE STORY
WE WERE JUST AS CLOSE CHUMS AT THE AGE OF FIFTY AS WE HAD BEEN AT TEN AND JUST AS THRILLED AT NEW ADVANCES IN COMMUNICATION AT TELEVISION AT THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE AT THE SUPPOSED SIGNALS FROM MARS
BUT UPON TWO YOUNG MEN IN THE CLASS IT MADE A POWERFUL IMPRESSION IT CRYSTALLIZED WITHIN THEM CERTAIN VAGUE CONCEPTIONS AND BROUGHT THEM TO A CONSCIOUS FOCUS ENABLING THE YOUNG MEN TO TURN FORMLESS DREAMS INTO CONCRETE ACTS
INQUIRED THE WIZARD
THIS FOR MANY REASONS WAS A MOST AMAZING PIECE OF NEWS TO MYSELF AND TO ANYONE WHO KNEW BENDA OF COURSE IT WAS COMMONLY KNOWN THAT BENDA WAS BEING SOUGHT BY UNIVERSITIES AND CORPORATIONS
I WOULDN'T GO BACK TO IT IF I COULD DON'T YOU ADMIRE MY BEAUTY STRANGERS TELL US COO EE OH
THE BELL RANG I FOLLOWED TO THE RECITATION HALL AND WAS ASSIGNED A SEAT BELOW THE REST BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY SMALL SONOMA GIRL YET ENROLLED I MADE SEVERAL LIFE LONG FRIENDS AT THAT INSTITUTE
THIS PART IS RELATED BY PETER HAGSTROM PH D THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE IDEAS FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO ANOTHER SAID A PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY TO HIS CLASS IS THE PRINCIPAL DISTINCTION
WHOSE ANGER HAD COOLED AND SHE ASKED THE QUESTION GEORGIA HAD I RAISED MY SLEEVE SHOWED THE WELT ON MY ARM AND REPLIED I AM GOING TO SEE IF I CAN'T FIND A HOME WHERE THEY WILL TREAT ME KINDLY POOR GRANDMA WAS CONSCIENCE STRICKEN
BUT MY LONG YEARS OF TRAINING IN PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION TOLD ME THAT A CHARACTER AND A FRIENDSHIP BUILT DURING FORTY YEARS DOES NOT CHANGE IN SIX MONTHS
AND ALMOST DECIDED TO CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT THE VISIT BECAUSE OF THE COLD EVASIVENESS OF THE REPLY I RECEIVED FROM HIM MY FIRST IMPULSE ON READING HIS INDIFFERENT LACKADAISICAL COMMENT ON MY PROPOSED VISIT WAS TO FEEL OFFENDED AND DETERMINE TO LET HIM ALONE AND NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN
THE SPEAKING LAUGHING AND CLAPPING OF HANDS WITH WHICH THE OLD HOME CUSTOMS WERE INTRODUCED IN THE NEW LAND THERE I WORE A DARK CALICO DRESS AND SUN BONNET
WELL I DON'T CARE MY NOSE COULD NEVER LOOK LIKE HIS EVEN IF I HAD THE SMALLPOX FOR THERE IS NOT SO MUCH OF IT TO SPOIL OUR DISLIKE OF THE MAN BECAME INTENSE AND LATER WHEN WE DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS TO BE BARTENDER AT GRANDPA'S BAR AND BOARD AT OUR HOUSE
I THINK SHE WOULD REFUSE TO ESCAPE WITH DOROTHY AND LEAVE THE OTHERS BEHIND OR TO ABANDON THE ISLAND WHICH IS THE LAWFUL HOME OF THE SKEEZERS I BELIEVE THE BEST PLAN WILL BE TO SUMMON THE THREE FISHES AND LEARN FROM THEM HOW TO RAISE THE ISLAND
HE WAS NOT THE TYPE OF MAN TO LEAVE A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR JOB AND JOIN A COMMUNIST CITY ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH THE CLERKS IN THE STORES AS IT HAPPENS I WAS ALSO INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH JOHN EDGEWATER SMITH
IS TO RECEIVE THE FATHER AND SO TO HAVE LIFE IN OURSELVES AND LIFE THE HIGHER THE DEEPER THE SIMPLER
FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO OF COURSE THE HEART WILL BE WHERE THE TREASURE IS BUT WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH THE ARGUMENT THIS
AS WOULD MOST CHRISTIANS NOWADAYS INSTEAD OF SETTING ABOUT BEING TRUE REQUESTS A DEFINITION OF TRUTH A PRESENTATION TO HIS INTELLECT IN SET TERMS OF WHAT THE WORD TRUTH MEANS BUT INSTANTLY WHETHER CONFIDENT OF THE USELESSNESS OF THE INQUIRY
IF THY LOVE WHICH IS BETTER THAN LIFE RECEIVE IT THEN SURELY THY TENDERNESS WILL MAKE IT GREAT THUS MAY THE HUMAN BEING SAY WITH HIMSELF THINK BROTHERS THINK
HIS VERY LIFE BEING HIS ESSENCE OF EXISTENCE WHAT BEST HE LOVED WHAT BEST HE WAS HE HAD BEEN AMONG THEM THEIR GOD BROTHER AND THE MIGHTY STORY ENDS WITH A CRY
OF THAT WHICH HE FIRST GAVE TO US THOU GOD HAST GIVEN ME HERE AGAIN IS THY GIFT I SEND MY SPIRIT HOME EVERY ACT OF WORSHIP IS A HOLDING UP TO GOD OF WHAT GOD HATH MADE US HERE LORD
NOT AS UNDERSTOOD BUT AS UNDERSTANDING LIVING AND BEING DOING AND CREATING THE TRUTH I AM THE TRUTH SAID OUR LORD
THE GIRL WHO SAID BEFORE A COMPANY OF MOCKING COMPANIONS I BELIEVE IN JESUS BORE TRUE WITNESS TO HER MASTER THE TRUTH DAVID BORE WITNESS TO GOD THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAID
BY TASTE BY INTELLECT BY POWER BY ART BY GENIUS OF ANY KIND AND SO WOULD GATHER GOLDEN OPINIONS TO BE TREASURED IN A STOREHOUSE OF EARTH NOR TO SUCH ONLY
BUT BLESSEDNESS YEA ECSTASY A HEART WHICH IS THE INMOST CHAMBER WHEREIN SPRINGS THE DIVINE FOUNTAIN OF YOUR BEING A HEART WHICH GOD REGARDS THOUGH YOU MAY NEVER HAVE KNOWN ITS EXISTENCE
DO THESE WORDS BEAR TERRIBLE WARNING FOR THE HURT LIES NOT IN THIS THAT THESE PLEASURES ARE FALSE LIKE THE DECEPTIONS OF MAGIC FOR SUCH THEY ARE NOT PLEASURES THEY ARE NOR YET IN THIS
THEN THE CRY MEANT IT IS FINISHED THE CRY MEANT FATHER INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SPIRIT EVERY HIGHEST HUMAN ACT IS JUST A GIVING BACK TO GOD
TO ALL THESE PRINCIPLES OF HELL OR OF THIS WORLD THEY ARE THE SAME THING AND IT MATTERS NOTHING WHETHER THEY ARE ASSERTED OR DEFENDED SO LONG AS THEY ARE ACTED UPON THE LORD THE KING GIVES THE DIRECT LIE
AS MANY AS I CAN BRING TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY GREATNESS OVER THEM MY JUDGMENT IS THE FAULTLESS RULE OF THINGS MY RIGHT IS WHAT I DESIRE THE MORE I AM ALL IN ALL TO MYSELF THE GREATER I AM
BUT THIS IS ONLY A FIGURE TRUE BUT IS THE REALITY INTENDED LESS OR MORE THAN THE FIGURE DOES NOT THE RUST AND THE MOTH MEAN MORE THAN DISEASE
ONE WHO BELIEVES MUST BEAR WITNESS ONE WHO SEES THE TRUTH MUST LIVE WITNESSING TO IT IS OUR LIFE THEN A WITNESSING TO THE TRUTH
TO UNDERSTAND THE WORDS OF OUR LORD IS THE BUSINESS OF LIFE FOR IT IS THE MAIN ROAD TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD HIMSELF AND TO RECEIVE HIM
BUT WE ARE CALLED UPON TO SHOW THAT WE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT WHEN I SAY TRUTH I DO NOT MEAN OPINION TO TREAT OPINION AS IF THAT WERE TRUTH IS GRIEVOUSLY TO WRONG THE TRUTH
HE WAS OFFERING HIMSELF TO HIS FATHER IN THE COMMUNION OF LOVING WORDS OF HIGH THOUGHTS OF SPEECHLESS FEELINGS AND BETWEEN HE TURNED TO DO THE SAME THING IN DEED NAMELY IN LOVING WORD
THAT WHAT IS WITH THE TREASURE MUST FARE AS THE TREASURE THAT THE HEART WHICH HAUNTS THE TREASURE HOUSE WHERE THE MOTH AND RUST CORRUPT WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE SAME RAVAGES AS THE TREASURE
IN SHADOW IN SUGGESTION HIMSELF ANY UTTERANCE WORTHY OF BEING CALLED A TRUTH IS HUMAN FOOD HOW MUCH MORE THE WORD PRESENTING NO ABSTRACT LAWS OF OUR BEING
THAT THEY PASS AWAY AND LEAVE A FIERCE DISAPPOINTMENT BEHIND THAT IS ONLY SO MUCH THE BETTER
HE WAS THE ONLY REAL KING THAT EVER SAT ON ANY THRONE IS EVERY CHRISTIAN EXPECTED TO BEAR WITNESS
THE LESS I ACKNOWLEDGE DEBT OR OBLIGATION TO ANOTHER THE MORE I CLOSE MY EYES TO THE FACT THAT I DID NOT MAKE MYSELF THE MORE SELF SUFFICING I FEEL OR IMAGINE MYSELF THE GREATER I AM
WITNESSED THEN TO THE HEIGHT OF HIS UTTERMOST ARGUMENT WHEN HE HUNG UPON THE CROSS LIKE A SIN AS PAUL IN HIS BOLDNESS EXPRESSES IT WHEN HIS WITNESS IS TREATED AS A LIE THEN MOST HE WITNESSES FOR HE GIVES IT STILL
WHAT EASIER FOR HIM THAN THUS TO HAVE CLEARED THE WAY AND OVER THE TRIBUTARY WORLD REIGNED THE JUST MONARCH THAT WAS THE DREAM OF THE JEWS NEVER SEEN IN ISRAEL OR ELSEWHERE BUT HAUNTING THE HOPES AND LONGINGS OF THE POOR AND THEIR HELPERS
FOR OF THE THOUSANDS WHO PASS THROUGH IT EVERY DAY NOT ONE ENLIGHTENS HIS NEIGHBOUR LEFT BEHIND BUT SHALL I NOT LONG WITH AGONY FOR ONE BREATH OF THY AIR AND NOT RECEIVE IT
THOUGH HE HAS EXECUTED THESE TWO TASKS YET HE SHALL NOT BE MY HUSBAND TILL HE BRINGS ME AN APPLE
IN FACT I ACCIDENTALLY UNCOVERED IT BY MOVING A COLLECTION OF HIS TOOLS I HADN'T PREVIOUSLY DISTURBED NO SOONER HAD I CLOSED THE CIRCUIT THAN I HEARD A SCREAM FROM SALLIE AND SAW HER FALL BACKWARDS I HAD GIVEN HER A SHOCK WITHOUT KNOWING IT
ON THE EDGE OF WHICH HE NOTICED THREE FISHES WHICH HAD GOT ENTANGLED IN THE REEDS AND WERE GASPING FOR WATER THOUGH FISH ARE GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE QUITE MUTE
WHERE THE TREE OF LIFE GROWS AND FETCHED THE GOLDEN APPLE FOR YOU FULL OF JOY THE YOUNG MAN STARTED ON HIS WAY BACK AND BROUGHT THE GOLDEN APPLE TO THE LOVELY PRINCESS
AND HE IS BESIDES ONLY THIRTY EIGHT STRONG AS A BULL WITH AN IRON CONSTITUTION AND VERY FOND OF HIS BUSINESS THE INDUSTRIOUS AND CIVIL JOURNEYMAN THAT YOU SAW IN THE SHOP SUPPLIES HIS PLACE
THE SERVANT AT ONCE TURNED INTO A SIDE PATH AND THE ANT KING CALLED AFTER HIM WE'LL REMEMBER AND REWARD YOU THE ROAD NEXT LED THROUGH A WOOD WHERE HE SAW A FATHER AND A MOTHER RAVEN
WHEN THEY HAD SEEN ALL BUT THE UP STAIRS MURPHY SAID YOU MUST OWN THAT MY FRIEND IS A LUCKY FELLOW THIS HOUSE AND PROPERTY ARE HIS WITHOUT COUNTING A THOUSAND CROWNS IN HAND TO CARRY ON HIS BUSINESS WITH
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE TO BRING HER BACK AS SHE'D WORKED HARD ALL DAY THEN I THOUGHT OF SALLIE PAGE IT'S TRUE SHE'S DEAF BUT SHE HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY SO TO SPEAK A LONG WHILE AND SHE KNOWS THE SHOP AND THE GOODS PRETTY WELL
ONE MOMENT SAID THE CHOURINEUR WITH A DOWNCAST AND EMBARRASSED AIR TAKING MURPHY BY THE ARM LISTEN WHILST I SAY A WORD TO YOU
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT TWAS THE PAY OF AN ADJUTANT SUB OFFICER I REPLIED
HE'LL STICK BY JIMMIE THROUGH THICK AND THIN FOR HE SAYS HE KNOWS HE'S INNOCENT AND YOURSELF HOW DOES YOUR LOYALTY MEET THE TEST AMY MASON DREW HERSELF UP A SPLENDID FIGURE OF BEAUTIFUL WOMANHOOD
AND TELLING EACH OTHER ALL THEY HAD SEEN IN THE FIELDS AND WOODS THE PIECE OF THE WHITE SNAKE WHICH HE HAD EATEN HAD ENABLED HIM TO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALS
TELL ME FRANKLY SHE BEGGED DOESN'T THIS MAKE IT LOOK A LITTLE WORSE FOR MISTER DARCY YES MISS MASON IT DOES I HAD BEST BE FRANK WITH YOU THE PROSECUTOR IS BOUND TO SHOW THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE WIRES
WELL I'LL DROP HIS CASE THAT'S ALL IF DARCY SIMULATED SURPRISE WHEN THE NEXT MORNING AT THE JAIL
WHAT A COUNTENANCE HE WHO LOOKED SO MILD AND GENTLE I WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED AT THAT MOMENT I WAS INDEED WELL WHAT THEN YOU SAID TO ME GOOD DAY CHOURINEUR
WAS TELEPHONED TO BY MISS MASON
DRESS HIM TONNERRE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY AMBITION AS IT WAS THE GOUALEUSE'S TO SUCK BARLEY SUGAR WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE UN
PROMPT ACTION ON THE PART OF THE PHYSICIAN ON THE HOSPITAL AMBULANCE HAD STARTED HER FEEBLE HEART WHICH HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY TO BEATING
AND TO SEE HIM WALK WITH BOTH HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF HIS LONG AND WARM COAT OF DARK BROADCLOTH HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THE MOST INOFFENSIVE CITIZENS IN THE WORLD FAITH MY FINE FELLOW
AND OF COURSE YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE I NEVER COULD PLAN TO INJURE SALLIE PAGE THAT WAY OR THE YOUNG LADY WHO WAS KNOCKED DOWN THE OTHER DAY
VERY WELL HIS CHIEF ANXIETY IS REGARDING YOU I REALIZE THIS IS A TEST OF FRIENDSHIP MISS MASON A TEST OF BOTH THE LOYALTY OF YOURSELF AND YOUR FATHER AND
HAD TAKEN HER AWAY FROM THERE
WHEN I FOUND I NEEDED HELP IT WASN'T MUCH JUST THE LITTLE ODDS AND ENDS THAT A WOMAN CAN DO BETTER THAN A MAN WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING THINGS LOOK FANCY I MIGHT HAVE TELEPHONED FOR MISS BRILL
THE SAME ELECTRIC WIRES ON THE SHOWCASE THAT SHOCKED MISS BRILL THE OTHER DAY THE ELECTRICIANS HAD BEEN TOLD TO REMOVE THEM BUT HAD NOT YET DONE SO BUT I THOUGHT THOSE WIRES WERE DEAD CUT AFTER THE OTHER ACCIDENT MISTER KETTRIDGE
THE YOUTH SAT DOWN IN THE GARDEN AND WONDERED HOW IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH A TASK BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO EXPEDIENT AND SAT THERE SADLY EXPECTING TO MEET HIS DEATH AT DAYBREAK
STANDING BY THEIR NEST AND THROWING OUT THEIR YOUNG AWAY WITH YOU YOU YOUNG RASCALS THEY CRIED WE CAN'T FEED YOU ANY LONGER YOU ARE QUITE BIG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT YOURSELVES NOW
THEN YOU NEVER KNEW YOUR WIRES MIGHT BY THE CLOSING OF THE SWITCH ON YOUR TABLE SHOCK SOME ONE STANDING NEAR THE SHOW CASE I NEVER DREAMED OF IT THE WIRES MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SINCE I USED THEM THAT WILL BE LOOKED INTO
YOU YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME GUILTY BECAUSE OF THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT DO YOU IF I DID I WOULDN'T STILL BE HANDLING YOUR CASE MISTER DARCY WAS THE ANSWER BUT I DON'T SAY THAT THERE ISN'T SOMETHING TO EXPLAIN I AM NOW GIVING YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
HE MUST BE CONTENT TO FORFEIT HIS LIFE MANY HAD RISKED THEIR LIVES BUT IN VAIN WHEN THE YOUTH SAW THE KING'S DAUGHTER HE WAS SO DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY THAT HE FORGOT ALL IDEA OF DANGER
THE LEAST THINGS BECOME GREAT EVENTS IN THE COUNTRY
THE WAY WAS LONG AND THE COLD EXCESSIVE WERE THEY NOT
AND MUCH COMMOTION IN THE STREETS AND A HERALD RODE ABOUT ANNOUNCING THE KING'S DAUGHTER SEEKS A HUSBAND BUT WHOEVER WOULD WOO HER MUST FIRST EXECUTE A DIFFICULT TASK AND IF HE DOES NOT SUCCEED
ON OPEN FLOE WITH NO WORSE PITFALL THAN A SHALLOW CRACK OR STEEP SIDED SNOW DRIFT AT LEAST I COULD FEEL THAT EVERY SPOT WHICH WAS LIKELY TO BE THE SCENE OF SUCH AN ACCIDENT WOULD BE SEARCHED THUS ELEVEN O'CLOCK CAME WITHOUT CHANGE
I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO WARN WILSON CONCERNING THE DESIRABILITY
AT INTERVALS UPON ITS CREST BUNDLES OF TOW WELL SOAKED IN PETROL AT LENGTH CLISSOLD AND I WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE HUT AND AS THE HOURS WENT BY I GREW EVER MORE ALARMED IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO CONCEIVE HOW AN

NELSON FORDE AND HOOPER LEFT SHORTLY AFTER SIMILARLY EQUIPPED TO FOLLOW THE SHORE OF THE SOUTH BAY IN SIMILAR FASHION THEN TURN OUT TO THE RAZOR BACK AND SEARCH THERE
THE ASSISTANCE OF LINK AND BY TELLING HIM OF THE NEW EVIDENCE WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND PLACE HIM THEREBY IN POSSESSION OF NEW MATERIAL TO PROSECUTE THE CASE BUT LINK LATELY HAD TAKEN SO PESSIMISTIC A VIEW OF THE MATTER
AS THE ANNIHILATION OF THE UNKNOWN BUT IT IS SIMPLY THE UNWEARIED ENDEAVOUR TO REMOVE ITS BOUNDARIES A LITTLE FURTHER
TWO A M THE SEARCH PARTIES HAVE RETURNED AND ALL IS WELL AGAIN BUT WE MUST HAVE NO MORE OF THESE VERY UNNECESSARY ESCAPADES
SEEMED RATHER STUFFY IN THE HUT LAST NIGHT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO SLEEP AND NOTICED A GOOD MANY OTHERS IN LIKE CASE I FOUND THE TEMPERATURE WAS ONLY
AFTER HE LEFT THE HOUSE THEN IF SHE DID NOT KNOW HIS WHEREABOUTS HOW COULD SHE KILL HIM ASKED DENZIL PERTINENTLY BROUGHT TO A POINT WHICH SHE COULD NOT EVADE BELLA DECLINED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION
IF THEY ARE RIGHT I SHALL HAVE TO OWN THAT MY JUDGMENT OF ATTRIBUTES IS VERY MUCH AT FAULT I MUST FIND OUT
AND A FLASK OF BRANDY HIS ORDERS WERE TO SEARCH THE EDGE OF THE LAND
WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT ONE DOES NOT HAVE GOOD CONTROL OF HIS SKI AND STANDS THE CHANCE
STILL ON RECALLING MISS GREEB'S DESCRIPTION OF THE BENSUSAN HOUSEHOLD HE CONCLUDED THAT THE RED HEAD WAS THE PROPERTY OF RHODA THE SHARP SERVANT AND ARGUED FROM HER APPEARANCE IN THE BACKGROUND AND RAPID DISAPPEARANCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF LISTENING TO CONVERSATIONS
WITH A CLEAR SKY IT WAS QUITE TWILIGHTY AT NOON TO DAY ALREADY SUCH SIGNS OF DAY ARE INSPIRITING
PRETTY REFLECTED BELLA SCORNFULLY I NEVER COULD SEE IT MYSELF A PAINTED UP MINX DRAGGED UP FROM THE GUTTER I WONDER AT YOUR TASTE MISTER DENZIL INDEED I DO PRETTY THE IDEA WHAT FOOLS MEN ARE I'M GLAD I NEVER MARRIED ONE
AND RAISED AT THE HEEL ON A BLOCK
CORALS AND SOME SHELLS ALL REPRESENTATIVE OF PRESENT DAY FAUNA
A MAN HAS NOT ONLY TO SAFEGUARD THE CIRCULATION IN HIS LIMBS BUT MUST STRUGGLE WITH A SLUGGISHNESS OF BRAIN
IN SPITE OF THE GRAVITY OF THE TASK IN WHICH HE WAS CONCERNED AT THAT MOMENT HE THOUGHT MORE OF DIANA'S LOOKS AND SPEECH
NEXT WRIGHT GRAN AND LASHLY SET OUT FOR THE BERGS TO LOOK THOROUGHLY ABOUT THEM AND FROM THENCE PASS ROUND AND EXAMINE INACCESSIBLE ISLAND AFTER THESE PARTIES GOT AWAY MEARES AND DEBENHAM STARTED WITH A LANTERN TO SEARCH TO AND FRO

MISSUS BENSUSAN GASPED LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER AND PATTED HER FAT BREAST WITH HER FAT HAND AS THOUGH TO GIVE HERSELF COURAGE IT IS NOT LIKE A GENTLEMAN TO SAY THAT ANOTHER GENTLEMAN'S HIS FRIEND WHEN HE AIN'T SHE SAID WITH AN ATTEMPT AT DIGNITY
THE WINTER'S EVAPORATION IF IT DOES EVAPORATION BECOMES A MATTER OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT PICTURE SHOWING THE FIND OF SPONGES ON THE KOETTLITZ GLACIER HEAPS OF LARGE SPONGES WERE FOUND CONTAINING

RUDYARD KIPLING CONFIDENT OF HIS GOOD INTENTIONS BUT DOUBTFUL OF HIS FORTITUDE SO FAR AS I CAN VENTURE TO OFFER AN OPINION ON SUCH A MATTER THE PURPOSE
TRIBUTARY GLACIERS HAVE CARVED THE CHANNELS IN WHICH THEY LIE THE CANADIAN GLACIER LIES DEAD BUT AT GRADE IT HAS CUT A VERY DEEP CHANNEL
DECIDED TO START OFF OVER THE FLOE MAKING RESPECTIVELY
HER FACE WAS WHITE AND ROUND LIKE A PALE MOON
THE TEMPERATURE HAS BEEN HOVERING
THAT MY PAST LIFE LEFT ME NO RIGHT TO DREAM OF SUCH A FUTURE AND THAT I WAS ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR WHICH MY HABITS AND REPUTATION WERE FAR FROM GIVING ANY GUARANTEE
DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS ILLNESS I HAD HARDLY LEFT HIS SIDE SPRING WAS PROFUSE IN ITS FLOWERS ITS LEAVES ITS BIRDS ITS SONGS AND MY FRIEND'S WINDOW OPENED GAILY UPON HIS GARDEN FROM WHICH A REVIVING BREATH OF HEALTH SEEMED TO COME TO HIM
WHOSE SENTIMENT AND WHOSE MELANCHOLY LETTERS AMUSED ME GREATLY
I THEREFORE SAID TO MY FRIEND THAT I INSISTED ON HAVING HER PERMISSION TO BE INTRODUCED TO HER AND I WANDERED TO AND FRO IN THE CORRIDORS SAYING TO MYSELF THAT IN A MOMENT'S TIME SHE WAS GOING TO SEE ME AND THAT I SHOULD NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO LOOK
SAID MARGUERITE WE WILL WALK THERE A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARD I SAW MARGUERITE FROM THE STREET AT A WINDOW OF ONE OF THE LARGE ROOMS OF THE RESTAURANT PULLING THE CAMELLIAS OF HER BOUQUET TO PIECES ONE BY ONE ONE OF THE TWO MEN WAS LEANING OVER HER SHOULDER AND WHISPERING IN HER EAR
I MUST TELL YOU MY FRIEND THAT FOR TWO YEARS THE SIGHT OF THIS GIRL HAD MADE A STRANGE IMPRESSION ON ME WHENEVER I CAME ACROSS HER WITHOUT KNOWING WHY I TURNED PALE AND MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY I HAVE A FRIEND WHO STUDIES THE OCCULT SCIENCES AND HE WOULD CALL WHAT I EXPERIENCED THE AFFINITY OF FLUIDS
HE HAD ALWAYS OBSTINATELY REFUSED TO TELL HIS FAMILY OF THE DANGER WHICH HE HAD BEEN IN AND WHEN HE WAS WELL AGAIN HIS FATHER DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT HE HAD BEEN ILL ONE EVENING WE HAD SAT AT THE WINDOW LATER THAN USUAL
WHOM ARE YOU BOWING TO I ASKED MARGUERITE GAUTIER HE SAID SHE SEEMS MUCH CHANGED FOR I DID NOT RECOGNISE HER I SAID WITH AN EMOTION THAT YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND SHE HAS BEEN ILL THE POOR GIRL WON'T LAST LONG I REMEMBER THE WORDS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SPOKEN TO ME YESTERDAY
I SHOWED HIM THE PAWN TICKETS THE RECEIPTS OF THE PEOPLE TO WHOM I HAD SOLD WHAT I COULD NOT PAWN
I COULD NOT HELP SAYING HAPPY MAN WHY TO GO AND SEE THAT WOMAN ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER NO I SAID FLUSHING FOR I REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY BUT I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KNOW HER COME WITH ME I WILL INTRODUCE YOU
I CAN NOT HELP WANTING TO EXPLAIN ALL MY CONDUCT TO YOU AND I HAVE WRITTEN YOU A LETTER BUT WRITTEN BY A GIRL LIKE ME SUCH A LETTER MIGHT SEEM TO BE A LIE UNLESS DEATH HAD SANCTIFIED IT BY ITS AUTHORITY AND INSTEAD OF A LETTER IT WERE A CONFESSION TO DAY I AM ILL
I TOOK UP MY POSITION AT THE MAISON D'OR IN ONE OF THE FIRST FLOOR ROOMS AND DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE WINDOW FOR AN INSTANT AT ONE IN THE MORNING MARGUERITE GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE WITH HER THREE FRIENDS I TOOK A CAB AND FOLLOWED THEM
TO SELL ALL SHE HAD FOR HIM THEN THE DAY OF REPROACHES AND REGRETS WOULD ARRIVE
THOSE WHO SET HER IN MOTION YOUR FATHER HAD WRITTEN ME A VERY POLITE LETTER IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT CONSENT TO SEE HIM HE DID NOT PRESENT HIMSELF QUITE AS HE HAD WRITTEN HIS MANNER AT FIRST WAS SO STIFF INSOLENT AND EVEN THREATENING
THAT IS NOT THE WAY I SAID WE MUST GO AND GET SOME SWEETS SHE ASKED ME FOR SOME WE WENT INTO A CONFECTIONER'S IN THE PASSAGE DE L'OPERA I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE WHOLE SHOP AND I WAS LOOKING ABOUT TO SEE WHAT SWEETS TO CHOOSE WHEN MY FRIEND ASKED FOR A POUND OF RAISINS GLACES
THE HEART IS A STRANGE THING I WAS ALMOST GLAD AT HEARING IT EVERY DAY I WENT TO ASK AFTER HER WITHOUT LEAVING MY NAME OR MY CARD
SHE LOVES AND SHE TOO HAS MADE THIS LOVE THE DREAM OF HER LIFE
THAT TO THE AGE OF PASSION SUCCEEDS THE AGE WHEN MAN IF HE IS TO BE RESPECTED MUST PLANT HIMSELF SOLIDLY IN A SERIOUS POSITION MY SON HAS NO FORTUNE
AND LIVE WITH YOU WITHOUT BEING A TOO HEAVY EXPENSE I TOLD HIM OF OUR HAPPINESS OF HOW YOU HAD SHOWN ME THE POSSIBILITY OF A QUIETER AND HAPPIER LIFE AND HE ENDED BY GIVING IN TO THE EVIDENCE OFFERING ME HIS HAND AND ASKING PARDON FOR THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST APPROACHED ME
BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER MARGUERITE AND HER FRIEND LEFT THE BOX I ROSE FROM MY SEAT ARE YOU GOING SAID ERNEST YES WHY AT THAT MOMENT HE SAW THAT THE BOX WAS EMPTY
TIME WENT BY THE IMPRESSION IF NOT THE MEMORY FADED GRADUALLY FROM MY MIND I TRAVELLED LOVE AFFAIRS HABITS WORK TOOK THE PLACE OF OTHER THOUGHTS AND WHEN I RECALLED THIS ADVENTURE I LOOKED UPON IT AS ONE OF THOSE PASSIONS WHICH ONE HAS
AFTER ALL WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME I SAID AFFECTING TO SPEAK IN A NONCHALANT WAY I SHALL NEVER SEE THIS WOMAN AGAIN AND IF I LIKED HER BEFORE MEETING HER IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT NOW THAT I KNOW HER BAH
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I LOVE YOUR SON
ILLNESSES LIKE ARMAND'S HAVE ONE FORTUNATE THING ABOUT THEM THEY EITHER KILL OUTRIGHT OR ARE VERY SOON OVERCOME A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE EVENTS WHICH I HAVE JUST RELATED ARMAND WAS CONVALESCENT AND WE HAD ALREADY BECOME GREAT FRIENDS
NOTHING THAT DAME FROM HER WAS INDIFFERENT TO ME I ROSE TO MY FEET SAYING IN AN ALTERED VOICE WHICH I COULD NOT ENTIRELY CONTROL IF THAT IS WHAT YOU THINK OF ME MADAME I HAVE ONLY TO ASK YOUR PARDON FOR MY INDISCRETION
I DID NOT RECOGNISE HER SHE WAS VEILED IT IS TRUE BUT VEILED THOUGH SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWO YEARS EARLIER I SHOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED TO SEE HER IN ORDER TO RECOGNISE HER I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HER INTUITIVELY
SUCH AS WAS JUST THEN BEGINNING TO BE THE FASHION
HIS LETTER WHICH I INCLOSE WITH THIS BEGGED ME IN THE MOST SERIOUS TERMS TO KEEP YOU AWAY ON THE FOLLOWING DAY ON SOME EXCUSE OR OTHER AND TO SEE YOUR FATHER WHO WISHED TO SPEAK TO ME AND ASKED ME PARTICULARLY NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT IT
I COULD NOT POSSIBLY TELL YOU WHAT THEY WERE ACTING ALL THAT I REMEMBER IS THAT FROM TIME TO TIME I RAISED MY EYES TO THE BOX I HAD QUITTED SO ABRUPTLY AND THAT THE FACES OF FRESH VISITORS SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER ALL THE TIME I WAS FAR FROM HAVING GIVEN UP THINKING ABOUT MARGUERITE
THE DOCTOR HAD ALLOWED HIM TO GET UP AND WE OFTEN SAT TALKING AT THE OPEN WINDOW AT THE HOUR WHEN THE SUN IS AT ITS HEIGHT FROM TWELVE TO TWO I WAS CAREFUL NOT TO REFER TO MARGUERITE FEARING LEST THE NAME SHOULD AWAKEN SAD RECOLLECTIONS
I DON'T DESPAIR OF SEEING YOU ONE DAY AT THE BACK OF HER BOX AND OF BEARING THAT YOU ARE RUINING YOURSELF FOR HER HOWEVER YOU ARE RIGHT SHE HASN'T BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP BUT SHE WOULD BE A CHARMING MISTRESS TO HAVE HAPPILY THE CURTAIN ROSE AND MY FRIEND WAS SILENT
HIDDEN UNDER THE APPARENT CALM OF THE INVALID BUT ARMAND ON THE CONTRARY SEEMED TO DELIGHT IN SPEAKING OF HER NOT AS FORMERLY WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES BUT WITH A SWEET SMILE WHICH REASSURED ME AS TO THE STATE OF HIS MIND
SHE WAS ELEGANTLY DRESSED SHE WORE A MUSLIN DRESS WITH MANY FLOUNCES AN INDIAN SHAWL EMBROIDERED AT THE CORNERS WITH GOLD AND SILK FLOWERS
BUT ALFRED BENNETT IS A MAN OF SENSE NOT TO MARRY ANY OF THE STRING OF WOMEN WHO I SUPPOSE ARE RUNNING AFTER HIM SHE SAID MISS CLINTON LOOKED AT HER IN A MILD KIND OF WONDER BUT SHE WENT ON HACKING MISTER JOHNSON'S COAT SLEEVE WITH THE NEEDLE WITHOUT NOTICING THE GLANCE AT ALL
TO KEEP UP CONVERSATION WITH AUNT ADELINE THAN WEAR THAT DRESS AGAIN
FOR I COULD SEE FROM AUNT ADELINE'S SHOULDER BEYOND MISS CLINTON HOW SHE WAS ENJOYING THAT AND SHE ADDED ANOTHER DISTINGUISHED ANCESTOR TO HIS PEDIGREE EVERY TIME AUNT BETTIE PAUSED FOR BREATH I COULDN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT THE FISH AND AUNT ADELINE WOULDN'T
OF COURSE KLEIN PAYS MADAME COURTIER A COMMISSION FOR THE CUSTOMERS SHE PASSES ON TO HIM THE ONE FOR ME MUST HAVE LOOKED TO HER LIKE A BIG TRANSACTION
VACANT CHAIR IN A WAY THAT MADE ME SEE THAT SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO FILL THE VACANCY I AM SORRY SHE WORRIED HERSELF ABOUT THAT ANYHOW IT MADE ME TAKE A RESOLVE AFTER BREAKFAST I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TO SPEAK TO JANE
ONLY GOING TO THE HOTEL TO SLEEP AND MOST OF THE TIME I FORGOT TO EAT MADAME RENE MUST HAVE BEEN MADAME COURTIER'S TWIN SISTER IN YOUTH AND MADAME TELLIERS IN THE HAT DEPARTMENT WAS THE TRIPLET TO THEM BOTH
WHEN WOMEN HAVE GENIUS IT BREAKS OUT ALL OVER THEM LIKE MEASLES AND THEY NEVER RECOVER FROM IT THOSE WOMEN HAD THE CONFLUENT KIND BUT I KNOW THAT MADAME RENE REALLY APPROVED OF ME
AND I MIGHT NOT HAVE GOT THE VERY THING HE WANTED
HE EXCLAIMED AS HE CAME CLOSE UNDER THE SILL WHICH IS NOT HIGH FROM THE GROUND IF YOU PUT YOUR FACE DOWN TO THE MUD AND SING SOMETHING TO EM THEY'LL COME OUT OF THEIR HOLES A BEETLE COMED TOO BUT I COULDN'T KETCH EM BOTH LIFT ME UP AND I CAN PUT HIM IN THE WATERGLASS ON YOUR TABLE
WALKING OFF OF ME IT WAS DELICIOUS THEN SHE AND TWO GIRLS WEARING FASHIONABLE FROCKS AND FASHIONABLE HAIR CAME IN AND DID THINGS TO A CORSET THEY LACED ON ME THAT I CAN'T EVEN WRITE DOWN FOR I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS
I WAS GLAD SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW GOOD THAT HEART DID FEEL UNDER MY BLOUSE WHEN THE BOY BROUGHT THAT BASKET OF FISH FROM JUDGE WADE'S FISHING EXPEDITION SATURDAY I HAVE FIRMLY DETERMINED NOT TO BLUSH ANY MORE AT THE THOUGHT OF THAT GORGEOUS MAN
BUT WHEN I DID I WAS IN THE PROPER GLOW ALL OVER WHEN I REVIVED AND SAW THE LOVELY PALE BLUSH ON HER FACE I FELT LIKE A CABBAGE ROSE BESIDE A TEA BUD I WAS GLAD AUNT ADELINE CAME IN JUST THEN SO I COULD GO IN AND TELL JULIA TO BRING OUT THE TEA AND CAKES
I HAD HEARD ABOUT HER AND I KNEW IT MEANT A FORTUNE BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER SHE CAME IN AND LOOKED AT ME FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT SAYING A WORD AND THEN SHE RAN HER HANDS DOWN AND DOWN OVER ME UNTIL I COULD FEEL THE SUPERFLUOUS FLESH JUST
AND WE HAD A BEAR REUNION IN THE WICKER CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THAT MADE US BOTH BREATHLESS WHAT DID YOU BRING ME MOLLY HE FINALLY KISSED UNDER MY RIGHT EAR A REAL CRICKET BALL AND BAT LOVER AND AN ENGINE WITH FIVE CARRIAGES
AND SHE LOST LOTS OF GOOD FRIENDS BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT I DON'T INTEND TO RUN ANY RISK OF LOSING MY FRIENDS THAT WAY AND I WANT THEM TO HAVE ALL THE ENJOYMENT THEY CAN GET OUT OF IT
PUT HIM DOWN NOW MISSUS MOLLY AND COME AND SAY OTHER HOW DO YOU DOES HE CALLED SOFTLY
WHEN TOM IN A DANGEROUS BLUE STRIPED SHIRT WITH A TIE THAT MELTED INTO IT IN TONE JUMPED OVER MY FENCE AND LANDED AT MY SIDE HE KISSED THE LACE RUFFLE ON MY SLEEVE WHILE I REPROVED HIM SEVERELY AND SETTLED DOWN TO ENJOY HIM
BILLY AND ME TONE OF VOICE THAT I LIKE A LITTLE ONLY I NEVER WILL I SAID IN A HURRY I WANT YOU TO ASK ME ANYTHING IN THE WORLD YOU WANT TO AND I'LL ALWAYS DO IT WELL LET ME TAKE YOU HOME THROUGH THE GARDEN THEN
WHAT IS A WOMAN GOING TO SAY WHEN SHE HAS A TOMBSTONE THROWN IN HER FACE LIKE THAT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BUT WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT AUNT ADELINE FILLED IN A DREADFUL PAUSE
I WON'T LET MYSELF EVEN THINK PERFECT FLOWER AND SCARLET RUNNER IF I DO I GET WARM AND HAPPY ALL OVER I TRY WHEN I GET HUNGRY TO THINK OF MYSELF IN THAT BLUE MUSLIN DRESS
I FELT QUEER ALL THE AFTERNOON AS I PACKED THOSE TRUNKS FOR THE FIVE O'CLOCK TRAIN YES THE WORD TROUSSEAU OUGHT TO HAVE A DEFINITE SURNAME AFTER IT ALWAYS AND THAT'S WHY MY LOYALTY DRAGGED POOR MISTER CARTER OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF MY CONSCIENCE
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE SUCH A GOOD TIME AS I GENERALLY DO WITH HIM HE WAS TOO FULL OF ANOTHER WOMAN AND EVEN A FIRST COUSIN CAN BE AN EXASPERATION IN THAT CONDITION
AND HUGGED MY KNEES UP UNDER MY CHIN WITH PLEASURE AT THE THOUGHT OF THE TOWN TALK THEY CONTAINED
I UNDERSTAND NOW WHY JUDGE WADE HAS HAD SO MANY WOMEN MARTYR THEMSELVES OVER HIM AND LIVE UNHAPPILY EVER AFTERWARD AS EVERYBODY SAYS HENRIETTA MASON IS DOING HE'S A VERY INSPIRING MAN AND HE FAIRLY BRISTLES WITH FASCINATIONS
AND AS SHE TALKED SHE WAS MENDING THE SLEEVE OF MISTER JOHNSON'S LOUNGE COAT I THINK AN OLD MAID IS JUST A WOMAN WHO HAS NEVER BEEN IN LOVE WITH A MAN WHO LOVES HER LOTS OF THEM HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR YEARS I SAID
PERFECTLY DUMB AND QUIET I SAT FOR A SPACE OF TIME AND WONDERED JUST WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IT WAS BEYOND ME AT THE MOMENT AND THE MOLLY THAT IS READY FOR LIFE QUICK DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY I SHUT MY EYES
OFF CAME HIS HAT INSTANTLY SO I COULD CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE FASCINATING FROST OVER HIS TEMPLES AND WITH A POSITIVE SIGH OF PLEASURE HE GOT INTO THE SAME CARRIAGE AND TOOK A SEAT BESIDE ME I TURNED WITH AN ECHO SMILE ALL OVER ME
SCARLET RUNNER AUNT BETTY INTRODUCED HER AS MISS CLINTON FROM LONDON OH MY DEAR MISSUS CARTER HOW GLAD I AM TO MEET YOU SHE SAID AS SHE TOWERED OVER ME IN A WILLOWY WAY AND HER VOICE WAS LOVELY AND COOL ALMOST TO SLIMNESS
SO I HURRIED AND STUFFED THE GREY BLUE DARLING IN THE TOP TRAY
AND I BOUGHT THINGS
LOOKING SO MUCH GRANDER THAN ANY OTHER MAN IN SIGHT THAT I DON'T SEE HOW THEY EVER STAND HIM AT THAT MINUTE THE NOBLE BLACK SILK DEED FELT FOOLISH BUT AT THE NEXT MINUTE I WAS GLAD I HAD DONE IT
SHE WALKED ON A FEW STEPS IN SILENCE GATHERING UP HER COURAGE THEN SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED I DID NOT TELL YOU YESTERDAY SHE BEGAN BREATHING QUICKLY AND PAINFULLY THAT COMING HOME WITH ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING
SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN LADY LINDORE HAD NOT A SINGLE THING TO WISH FOR ERGO SHE MUST BE THE HAPPIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD
THAT THE GENERAL WAS TO HAVE THE HONOUR OF GIVING HIS NAME TO THE NEXT IF A BOY FOR SHE WAS NOW NEAR HER SECOND CONFINEMENT AND WITH THIS PROMISE HENRY WAS SATISFIED TO SLIGHT THE ONLY BEING IN THE WORLD TO WHOM HE LOOKED FOR SUPPORT TO HIMSELF AND HIS CHILDREN
AND MADE HIMSELF ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE BLOOD HORSES THOROUGHBRED FILLIES AND BROOD MARES THEREIN SET FORTH
IT WAS A ROOMY OLD FASHIONED FLY WITH SEATS FOR FOUR HE SAT IN ONE CORNER STRETCHED HIS LEGS OUT ON THE FRONT SEAT AND SANK INTO MEDITATION A VAGUE SENSE OF THE ORDER INTO WHICH HIS AFFAIRS HAD BEEN BROUGHT
THAT IF THE LADY YOU INSULTED WAS NOT THE LADY WHOM I HOPE TO MAKE MY WIFE IT WAS THAT LADY'S FRIEND WHICH IS THE SAME THING IS IT INTERPOSED ELLA YOU HEAR HIM MADGE I HEAR
AND THERE IS HARDLY A DOUBT BUT THAT THEY ARE GONE OFF TOGETHER EVEN LADY JULIANA WAS SHOCKED AT THIS INTELLIGENCE THOUGH THE FOLLY MORE THAN THE WICKEDNESS OF THE THING SEEMED TO STRIKE HER MIND BUT HENRY WAS NO NICE OBSERVER
NOW WHILE HE HELD HIS LETTER IN HIS HANDS HE COULD NOT HELP PICTURING THE CHALLENGE WHICH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY FIND AT HOME TODAY OR TOMORROW AND THE DUEL ITSELF IN WHICH WITH THE SAME COLD AND HAUGHTY EXPRESSION THAT HIS FACE WAS ASSUMING AT THIS MOMENT
THE EXPLANATION ITSELF YOU WILL HEAR FROM GRAHAM'S OWN LIPS AFTER TEA HE IS HERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING YOU THAT EXPLANATION AFTER TEA I BELIEVE GRAHAM I AM CORRECT IN SAYING SO PERFECTLY
IF ON HEARING THIS NEWS HE WERE TO SAY TO HER RESOLUTELY PASSIONATELY WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S WAVERING THROW UP EVERYTHING AND COME WITH ME SHE WOULD GIVE UP HER SON AND GO AWAY WITH HIM BUT THIS NEWS HAD NOT PRODUCED WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED IN HIM
JACK MARTYN AND ANOTHER THIS SAID JACK REFERRING TO HIS COMPANION IS A FRIEND OF MINE IT WAS DARK IN THE PASSAGE AND MADGE WAS A LITTLE FLURRIED SHE PERCEIVED THAT JACK HAD A COMPANION AND THAT WAS ALL
FORGIVE ME BUT I REJOICE AT IT VRONSKY INTERRUPTED FOR GOD'S SAKE LET ME FINISH HE ADDED HIS EYES IMPLORING HER TO GIVE HIM TIME TO EXPLAIN HIS WORDS
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE FELT ON THE POINT OF WEEPING HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS TOUCHED HIM SO HE FELT SORRY FOR HER AND HE FELT HE COULD NOT HELP HER AND WITH THAT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS TO BLAME FOR HER WRETCHEDNESS
ALL THIS WAS ADDRESSED TO HENRY WHO HAD HOWEVER ATTAINED THE HAPPY ART OF NOT HEARING ABOVE ONE WORD OUT OF A HUNDRED THAT HAPPENED TO FALL FROM THE ANGEL LIPS OF HIS ADORED JULIA AND HAVING FINISHED THE NEWSPAPERS
IN WHICH CASE I SHOULD HAVE PROVED MYSELF MAD BECAUSE AS YOU PERCEIVE FOR YOURSELVES THE MAN'S A MONSTER
JACK WAVED HIS ARM EXCITEDLY I SAY IT'S THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING
HE SIMPLY SEEMED AS THOUGH HE WERE RESENTING SOME AFFRONT IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST PAINFUL TO ME IT HAPPENED OF ITSELF SHE SAID IRRITABLY AND SEE SHE PULLED HER HUSBAND'S LETTER OUT OF HER GLOVE
HER GRACE HAD ISSUED CARDS FOR A CONCERT AND AFTER MATURE DELIBERATION IT WAS DECIDED THAT HER RIVAL SHOULD STRIKE OUT SOMETHING NEW AND ANNOUNCE A CHRISTENING FOR THE SAME NIGHT THE FIRST INTIMATION DOUGLAS HAD OF THE HONOUR INTENDED HIM BY THIS ARRANGEMENT
THIS WAS ELLA I WILL GO ON IN MY OWN WAY IF YOU BUSTLE ME I'LL KEEP GOING ON FOR EVER DON'T I TELL YOU THIS IS MY SHOW DO YOU WANT TO QUEER IT WELL AS I WAS ABOUT TO OBSERVE WHEN I WAS INTERRUPTED
YOU WON'T FORGET TO LET ME HAVE AN INVITATION TO YOUR FUNERAL AND IN THE MEANTIME PERHAPS YOU'LL LET ME KNOW OF WHAT IT IS YOU'RE DYING NOW HE'S NOT ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO WEAR THEIR HEARTS UPON THEIR SLEEVES FOR DAWS TO PECK AT
TAKING UP HIS POSITION ON THE HEARTHRUG IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE
AND HAD SENT HIM A LARGE BOX OF PILLS AND A BOTTLE OF GOUT TINCTURE ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE HE DIED
HIS NAME'S GRAHAM HE DIGS IN THE SAME HOUSE I DO TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK
ONLY SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I AM READY TO GIVE MY EXPLANATION NOW I CANNOT BUT FEEL THAT I SHALL OCCUPY AN INVIDIOUS POSITION IN AT ANY RATE MISS BRODIE'S EYES UNTIL I HAVE EXPLAINED THEN FEEL
HE HIMSELF WISHES TO MOVE FOR A NEW SUBSIDY TO THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY
AND THAT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG IS NOT A DIVORCE POSSIBLE HE SAID FEEBLY SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NOT ANSWERING COULDN'T YOU TAKE YOUR SON AND STILL LEAVE HIM YES BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HIM
THAT IT WAS BETTER NOT TO BIND HIMSELF AND HE KNEW THAT THIS THOUGHT HE COULD NOT TELL HER HAVING READ THE LETTER HE RAISED HIS EYES TO HER AND THERE WAS NO DETERMINATION IN THEM SHE SAW AT ONCE THAT HE HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT BEFORE BY HIMSELF
WHEN SHE GOT HER HUSBAND'S LETTER SHE KNEW THEN AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART THAT EVERYTHING WOULD GO ON IN THE OLD WAY THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH OF WILL TO FOREGO HER POSITION TO ABANDON HER SON AND TO JOIN HER LOVER
SHE DID NOT WANT HIM NOW TO SAY WHAT WAS UNTRUE SHE HAD NOTHING LEFT HER BUT HIS LOVE AND SHE WANTED TO LOVE HIM DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE DAY I LOVED YOU EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED FOR ME
HE BORE HIMSELF SURPRISINGLY WELL THAT HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS DESERVING OF BETTER TREATMENT HALF UNCONSCIOUSLY TO HERSELF AND PROBABLY QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY TO HIM SHE KEPT A CORNER OF HER EYE UPON HIM ALL THE TIME
BEENNIE HAS BEEN PREVENTED FROM FINISHING A MOST BEAUTIFUL PAIR OF BOTTLE SLIDERS FOR YOUR LADYSHIP BY A WHITLOW BUT IT IS NOW MENDING AND I HOPE WILL BE DONE IN TIME TO GO WITH BABBY'S VASE CARPET WHICH IS EXTREMELY ELEGANT BY SIR S AND LADY MACLAUGHLAN
NOW I KNEW THAT BETHEL
HIS WHITE HANDS WERE ALL GLITTERING WITH RINGS
BUT MISS CARLYLE RETIRED TO BED THE SMOKE TO WHICH SHE HAD NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED SINCE HER FATHER'S DEATH HAD MADE HER HEAD ACHE AND HER EYES SMART ABOUT ELEVEN THEY WISHED MISTER CARLYLE GOOD NIGHT AND DEPARTED BUT MISTER DILL IN OBEDIENCE TO A NOD FROM HIS SUPERIOR REMAINED
I QUITTED HIM AND CAME OFF CONCLUDED RICHARD HARE HE EVIDENTLY HAD NOT SEEN THORN AND KNEW NOTHING
TANNERS CURRIERS AND LEATHER DRESSERS POSSESSING A RELATIVE OF THE NAME DILL SAID HE SOMETHING HAS ARISEN WHICH IN MY MIND CASTS A DOUBT UPON RICHARD HARE'S GUILT I QUESTION WHETHER HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER
TO THE PATH THAT LED FROM WEST LYNNE AND WAS LINGERING THERE WHEN SHE HEARD A SHOT
NO SIR ANSWERED JOYCE
VERY UNLIKELY MEN ARE THEY TO RUN INTO AN EXPEDITION OF THAT SORT WHAT EXPEDITION QUESTIONED RICHARD THE MURDER THE RIDING AFTER AFY RICHARD WHERE IS AFY RICHARD HARE LIFTED HIS EYES IN SURPRISE
TO WHAT END ELSE SHOULD I SAY THIS WENT ON RICHARD IT CAN DO ME NO SERVICE ALL THE ASSERTION I COULD PUT FORTH WOULD NOT GO A JOT TOWARD CLEARING ME NO IT WOULD NOT ASSENTED MISTER CARLYLE IF EVER YOU ARE CLEARED IT MUST BE BY PROOFS BUT
AND SHE TOOK IT INDOORS SHUTTING ME OUT I DID NOT GO AWAY
BUT NOW WHERE WAS LOCKSLEY
BRAINS HE CERTAINLY HAD BUT THEY WERE NOT SHARP ONES IS MY MOTHER COMING OUT TO ME ASKED RICHARD AFTER A FEW INTERCHANGED SENTENCES WITH MISTER CARLYLE NO YOU ARE TO GO INDOORS
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS I COULD NOT DO IT YOU KNOW IN THE FACE OF MY FATHER'S OPPOSITION YOUR WIFE REJOINED MISTER CARLYLE WITH SOME EMPHASIS RICHARD LOOKED SURPRISED WHY YOU DON'T SUPPOSE I MEANT ANYTHING ELSE
IN THE HOUSE WHEN HER FATHER WAS NOT AT HOME ROAMING ABOUT THE WOODS WITH HER WHEN HE WAS COME TO THE POINT RICHARD TO THE EVENING HALLIJOHN'S GUN WAS OUT OF ORDER AND HE REQUESTED THE LOAN OF MINE
TALL AND SLENDER AN OUT AND OUT ARISTOCRAT AND HIS CONNECTIONS WHERE DID HE LIVE I NEVER KNEW AFY IN HER BOASTING WAY WOULD SAY HE HAD COME FROM SWAINSON A TEN MILE RIDE FROM SWAINSON QUICKLY INTERRUPTED MISTER CARLYLE
AND I HID MYSELF IN SOME TREES NEAR THE HOUSE AGAIN LOCKSLEY CAME IN VIEW AND SAW ME THERE AND CALLED OUT TO KNOW WHY I WAS HIDING I SHIED FURTHER OFF AND DID NOT ANSWER HIM WHAT WERE MY PRIVATE MOVEMENTS TO HIM AND THAT ALSO TOLD AGAINST ME AT THE INQUEST
WELL THERE WAS A ROW AT HOME ABOUT MY GOING SO MUCH TO HALLIJOHN'S
AND NOTHING CAN TURN ME FROM THE BELIEF ALL WEST LYNNE IS CONVINCED OF IT MISTER CARLYLE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TURN HER FROM HER BELIEF HE DISMISSED HER AND SAT ON STILL REVOLVING THE CASE IN ALL ITS BEARINGS
I THINK IT WOULD BE A WONDER IF I DID HEAR WHY SO IF SHE WOULD GO OFF AFTER RICHARD HARE WHO HAD SENT HER FATHER INTO HIS GRAVE
I WAS MAD WITH JEALOUSY FOR I THEN SAW THAT AFY HAD SENT ME AWAY THAT SHE MIGHT ENTERTAIN HIM I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS THORN NEVER CAME BUT AT DUSK OBSERVED MISTER CARLYLE I NEVER KNEW HIM TO DO SO UNTIL THAT EVENING ALL I CAN SAY IS HE WAS THERE THEN
THAT WAS THE SHOT THAT KILLED HALLIJOHN THERE WAS A PAUSE MISTER CARLYLE LOOKED KEENLY AT RICHARD THERE IN THE MOONLIGHT
THAT THE MOMENT YOU SAW HIM YOU HESITATED AS FROM FEAR FLUNG BACK THE GUN AND ESCAPED RICHARD STAMPED HIS FOOT AYE AND ALL OWING TO MY CURSED COWARDICE
SIT DOWN A MOMENT DILL I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION YOU ARE INTIMATE WITH THE THORNS OF SWAINSON DO THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE ANY RELATIVE A NEPHEW OR COUSIN PERHAPS A DANDY YOUNG FELLOW I WENT OVER LAST SUNDAY FORTNIGHT TO SPEND THE DAY WITH YOUNG JACOB WAS THE ANSWER OF MISTER DILL
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM SINCE NEVER SINCE NEVER BUT ONCE AND I DON'T THINK I SHOULD KNOW HIM IF I DID SEE HIM
SILKY AS A HAIR AS FINE AS THE ONE BARBARA BOUGHT AT LYNNEBOROUGH AND GAVE A GUINEA FOR
COULD IT BE ONE OF THE THORNS OF SWAINSON NONE OF THE THORNS THAT I KNOW HE WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SORT OF MAN WITH HIS PERFUMED HANDS AND HIS RINGS AND HIS DAINTY GLOVES THAT HE WAS AN ARISTOCRAT I BELIEVE BUT OF BAD TASTE AND STYLE
HE WAS A BLUE EYED FAIR PLEASANT LOOKING YOUNG MAN SLIGHT AND OF MIDDLE HEIGHT AND QUITE AS YIELDING AND GENTLE AS HIS MOTHER IN HER THIS MILD YIELDINGNESS OF DISPOSITION WAS RATHER A GRACEFUL QUALITY IN RICHARD IT WAS REGARDED AS A CONTEMPTIBLE MISFORTUNE
AS A LEAF WAS SWAYED BY THE WIND SO HE WAS SWAYED BY EVERYBODY ABOUT HIM NEVER POSSESSING A WILL OF HIS OWN IN SHORT RICHARD HARE THOUGH OF AN AMIABLE AND LOVING NATURE WAS NOT OVER BURDENED WITH WHAT THE WORLD CALLS BRAINS
AFY CAME OUT ALL RESERVE AS SHE COULD BE AT TIMES AND SAID SHE WAS UNABLE TO RECEIVE ME THEN THAT I MUST GO BACK HOME WE HAD A FEW WORDS ABOUT IT AND AS WE WERE SPEAKING LOCKSLEY PASSED
BUT HE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD ANY SIGNS OF RICHARD'S BEING CONCEALED THERE BARBARA WAS AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT AND SHE CAME HERSELF AND OPENED THE DOOR TO MISTER CARLYLE
HE WAS WITHIN MY VIEW AT THE SAME TIME AT RIGHT ANGLES FROM ME DEEP IN THE WOOD AWAY FROM THE PATHS ALTOGETHER IT WAS THORN DID THE DEED BEYOND ALL DOUBT
I RAN TO THE HOUSE LEAPED UP THE TWO STEPS AND CARLYLE I FELL OVER THE PROSTRATE BODY OF HALLIJOHN HE WAS LYING JUST WITHIN ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR DEAD BLOOD WAS ROUND ABOUT HIM AND MY GUN JUST DISCHARGED WAS THROWN NEAR
HE TOOK PRECIOUS GOOD CARE OF THAT HE LIVES SOME MILES AWAY AND USED TO COME OVER IN SECRET COURTING AFY YES HE DID COME COURTING HER RETURNED RICHARD IN A SAVAGE TONE DISTANCE WAS NO BARRIER HE WOULD COME GALLOPING OVER AT DUSK TIE HIS HORSE TO A TREE IN THE WOOD AND PASS AN HOUR OR TWO WITH AFY
THE CAPTAIN SHE USED TO CALL HIM BUT SHE SAID HE WAS NOT A CAPTAIN YET AWHILE THE NEXT GRADE TO IT A A LIEUTENANT SUGGESTED MISTER CARLYLE YES SIR THAT WAS IT LIEUTENANT THORN JOYCE SAID MISTER CARLYLE
AN ABBEY HAD STOOD IN ITS VICINITY ALL TRACES OF WHICH SAVE TRADITION HAD PASSED AWAY THERE WAS ONE SMALL HOUSE OR COTTAGE JUST WITHIN THE WOOD AND IN THAT COTTAGE HAD OCCURRED THE MURDER FOR WHICH RICHARD HARE'S LIFE WAS IN JEOPARDY IT WAS NO LONGER OCCUPIED FOR NOBODY WOULD RENT IT OR LIVE IN IT
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THEY ARRIVED AT MISS CARLYLE'S
IT WAS A FATAL STEP YES I WAS A FOOL I THOUGHT I'D WAIT QUIET AND SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ALL
WHY SHOULD THE OTHERS BE REAL AND THAT A DREAM I DON'T THINK IT IS SAID ROBERT IT'S MY BIGGEST SELF EVIDENT FACT SAID KATE CONCLUSIVELY I NEVER HEARD ANY ONE ELSE SAY THESE THINGS BUT I THINK THEM AND THEY ARE PROVABLE
I SUSPECT SHE WAS DRIVING WITH THE PICTURE IN ONE HAND OH MY GOD HAVE MERCY THEY HAD COME TO DEEP GROOVES IN LOOSE GRAVEL THEN THE CUT IN THE EMBANKMENT THEN THEY COULD SEE THE WRECKED CAR STANDING ON THE ENGINE AND LYING AGAINST A BIG TREE NEAR THE WATER
PUT THE DUMPLINGS IN A POT OF BOILING WATER AND BOIL THEM AN HOUR WITHOUT ANY INTERMISSION IF ALLOWED TO STOP BOILING THEY WILL BE HEAVY SERVE THEM UP WITH PUDDING SAUCE OR BUTTER AND SUGAR
ROBERT SAID NOTHING HE SEEMED TOO STUNNED TO THINK KATE WANTED TO TELL HIM OF HER FINAL VISIT WITH NANCY ELLEN BUT SHE COULD NOT AT THAT TIME ROBERT'S AGED MOTHER CAME TO HIM AND SAID SHE COULD REMAIN AS LONG AS HE WANTED HER
SKIM IT CLEAR THEN LET IT SIMMER GENTLY EIGHT OR TEN MINUTES STRAIN IT THROUGH A FLANNEL BAG WHEN COOL BOTTLE CORK AND SEAL IT TIGHT AND KEEP IT IN A COOL PLACE
ORANGE SYRUP SQUEEZE OUT THE JUICE OF FRESH ORANGES AND STRAIN IT TO A PINT OF THE JUICE PUT A POUND AND A HALF OF SUGAR SET IT ON A MODERATE FIRE WHEN THE SUGAR HAS DISSOLVED PUT IN THE PEEL OF THE ORANGES
SHE WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WITH ADAM SHE WOULD MAKE HEROIC EFFORT TO HELP HIM TO CLEAN UNASHAMED MANHOOD SHE WOULD BE A BETTER SISTER TO ALL HER FAMILY SHE WOULD BE FRIENDLIER AND HAVE MORE PATIENCE WITH THE NEIGHBOURS
JESUS ACCEPTED HIM AND THAT WAS ALL THERE WAS TO IT WITH KATE THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK NANCY ELLEN CAME FLYING UP THE WALK ON WINGED FEET HERSELF SHE CARRIED PHOTOGRAPHS OF SEVERAL SMALL CHILDREN
SHE WOULD JOIN IN WHATEVER EFFORT THE CHURCH WAS MAKING TO HOLD AND INCREASE ITS MEMBERSHIP AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO RAISE FUNDS TO KEEP UP THE ORGANIZATION ALL THE TIME HER MIND WAS BUSY THINKING OUT THESE FINE RESOLVES
AS SOON AS IT BOILS UP WELL TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE LET IT REMAIN FOR A MINUTE THEN TAKE OFF THE SCUM SET IT BACK ON THE FIRE AND LET IT BOIL A MINUTE THEN TAKE IT OFF AND SKIM IT AGAIN THIS OPERATION REPEAT TILL THE SYRUP IS CLEAR
BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOU ARE RATHER LIMITING MAN WHEN YOU NARROW HIM TO FOUR PRIMAL INSTINCTS OH I DON'T KNOW SAID KATE AIR TO BREATHE AND FOOD TO SUSTAIN ARE PRESUPPOSED MAN LEARNS TO FIGHT IN SELF DEFENSE AND TO ACQUIRE WHAT HE COVETS
KATE YOU ARE MAKING THIS PLACE LOOK FINE I USED TO SAY I'D RATHER DIE THAN COME BACK HERE TO LIVE BUT LATELY IT HAS BEEN GROWING SO ATTRACTIVE I'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT HALF MY TIME AND WISHED I WERE THE OTHER HALF
THIS BELIEF IS AS MUCH A PART OF ANY MAN EVER BORN IN ANY LOCATION AS HIS HANDS AND HIS FEET WHETHER HE BELIEVES HIS SOUL ENTERS A CAT AND WORKS BACK TO MAN AGAIN AFTER LONG TRANSMIGRATION OR GOES TO A HAPPY HUNTING GROUND AS OUR INDIANS
SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF PROBATIONS AND EXAMINATIONS AND CATECHISMS SHE HAD READ THE BIBLE AS WAS THE CUSTOM EVERY MORNING BEFORE HER SCHOOL IN THAT BOOK WHEN A MAN WANTED TO FOLLOW JESUS HE FOLLOWED
THE NEIGHBOURS SILENTLY BEGAN TAKING AWAY THINGS THAT HAD BEEN USED WHILE MISSUS HOWE CHOSE HER WHITEST SHEET AND LAID IT ON A CHAIR NEAR ROBERT TWO DAYS LATER THEY LAID NANCY ELLEN BESIDE HER MOTHER THEN THEY BEGAN TRYING TO FACE THE PROBLEM OF LIFE WITHOUT HER
WHERE SHE SAT IN THE DEEP GRASS AND LOOKED AT THOSE THREE LONG MOUNDS AND TRIED TO UNDERSTAND LIFE DEEPER STILL TO FATHOM DEATH SHE AND HER MOTHER HAD AGREED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NOW KATE TRIED AS NEVER BEFORE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AND WHERE

I'M SURE MILLY WILL BE JOINING VERY SOON AND THAT SHE'LL WANT YOU WITH HER SAID KATE SHE WAS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL WOMAN BUT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THAT DAY SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS MOVING WITH WINGED FEET
STRAIN IT FOR USE THIS SYRUP DOES VERY WELL TO PRESERVE FRUIT IN FOR COMMON USE
AND WHY THAT SOMETHING WAS MANY DAYS SHE WOULD SIT FOR AN HOUR AT A TIME THINKING AND AT LAST SHE ARRIVED AT FIXED CONVICTIONS THAT SETTLED MATTERS FOREVER WITH HER ONE DAY AFTER SHE HAD ARRANGED THE FALL ROSES SHE HAD GROWN
I WENT INSIDE AND JOINED I'M GOING TO CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I CAN AFTER THIS AND I'M GOING TO HELP WITH THE WORK OF RUNNING IT WELL I LIKE THAT CRIED ADAM INDIGNANTLY WHY DIDN'T YOU LET ME GO WITH YOU

WHEN THE CARRIAGE HAD DRIVEN OFF WITH MISTER DINSMORE AND ELSIE THE REST OF THE YOUNG PARTY AT ONCE TURNED THEIR STEPS TOWARD THE HOUSE ARTHUR SKULKING IN THE REAR AND THE OTHERS EAGERLY DISCUSSING THE ACCIDENT AS THEY WENT
WHY DID YOU THINK I WAS IN TROUBLE PAPA SHE ASKED HIDING HER FACE ON HIS BREAST

BADE HIS LITTLE PATIENT GOOD NIGHT SAYING HE WOULD CALL AGAIN IN THE MORNING MISTER DINSMORE FOLLOWED HIM TO THE DOOR THAT'S A SWEET CHILD MISTER DINSMORE HE REMARKED I DON'T KNOW HOW ANY ONE COULD HAVE THE HEART TO INJURE HER BUT I THINK THERE HAS BEEN FOUL PLAY SOMEWHERE

BUT THESE SPRAINS ARE TEDIOUS THINGS AND SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WALK FOR SOME WEEKS GOOD NIGHT SIR DON'T BE TOO ANXIOUS SHE WILL GET OVER IT IN TIME AND YOU MAY BE THANKFUL IT IS NOTHING WORSE I AM INDEED DOCTOR MISTER DINSMORE SAID
SUCH A DEAR SWEET LITTLE GIRL AS ELSIE REMARKED CARRY HOWARD NO NOR I SAID HARRY
SEVERAL OTHER LITTLE ONES JOINED THEIR ENTREATIES TO FLORA'S AND AT LENGTH ELSIE SAID WELL
AND THEN I HAVE HAD SUCH A HARD DAY OF IT IT WAS SO DIFFICULT TO AMUSE THE CHILDREN
WAS IF POSSIBLE EVEN MORE THAN USUALLY TENDER AND AFFECTIONATE IN HIS MANNER TOWARD HER
SOMEWHAT IMPATIENTLY REALLY MARY YOU SEEM QUITE STUPID SOMETIMES MARY LOOKED HURT
ARE YOU QUITE SURE DOCTOR THAT HER SPINE HAS SUSTAINED NO INJURY ASKED THE FATHER ANXIOUSLY ADDING THERE IS SCARCELY ANYTHING I SHOULD SO DREAD FOR HER AS THAT NONE WHATEVER
ELSIE FELT IN BETTER SPIRITS IN THE MORNING HER SLEEP HAD REFRESHED HER AND SHE AROSE WITH A STRONGER CONFIDENCE IN THE LOVE OF BOTH HER EARTHLY AND HER HEAVENLY FATHER SHE FOUND HER PAPA READY AND WAITING FOR HER
ARTHUR SHE EXCLAIMED I COULD NEVER DO SUCH A WICKED THING I WOULD NOT DECEIVE PAPA SO FOR ANY MONEY AND EVEN IF I DID HE WOULD BE SURE TO FIND IT OUT
AND WHEN I TRIED THE DOOR IT WAS LOCKED AND I WENT AWAY AGAIN DIRECTLY BUT WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH ELSIE'S FALL ASKED MARY LESLIE
AND FEELING SOMEWHAT ASHAMED OF THEIR WANT OF POLITENESS THEY WENT INTO THE CHILDREN'S ROOM AFTER BREAKFAST AND EXERTED THEMSELVES FOR AN HOUR OR TWO FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE LITTLE ONES IT WAS BUT A SPASMODIC EFFORT HOWEVER AND THEY SOON GREW WEARY OF THE EXERTION AND AGAIN LET THE BURDEN FALL UPON ELSIE
AT THE PIANO BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE TO PLAY WHAT HE TOLD YOU TO
AND I ALWAYS LIKED HIM HE'S SO PLEASANT AND SO FUNNY TOO SOMETIMES BUT I MUST GO AND SHOW MY BRACELET TO LUCY HARK NO THERE'S THE BELL AND I'LL JUST LEAVE IT HERE UNTIL AFTER BREAKFAST ELSIE OPENED A DRAWER AND LAID IT CAREFULLY IN AND THEY RAN OFF TO THE NURSERY
DEAR PAPA YOU ARE SO KIND AND GOOD TO ME SHE SAID LAYING THEM DOWN TO PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND KISS HIM
ANNE IS A FINE WRITER AND I JUST CRIED LIKE A BABE OVER THAT LETTER IT WAS SO TOUCHING ALTHOUGH I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF HUGELY ALL THE TIME I WAS SO DELIGHTED TO FIND OUT THAT ANNE LOVED GILBERT STILL I WAS GETTING SKEERED SHE DIDN'T
BUT THEY THOUGHT AN AWFUL LOT OF EACH OTHER IT MADE ME FEEL YOUNG AGAIN TO SEE EM ANNE WASN'T A MOSSEL VAIN
FOR SPRINGDALE HAS ALWAYS BEEN NOTED FOR GETTING GOOD LOOKING SCHOOLMARMS JUST AS MILLER'S ROAD IS NOTED FOR ITS HUMLY ONES
HER HAND STUCK FAST TO HER SISTER'S DRESS AND NEITHER OF THEM COULD FREE HERSELF AT LAST IN CAME THE THIRD SISTER WITH THE SAME INTENTION KEEP AWAY KEEP AWAY SCREAMED THE OTHER TWO IN HEAVEN'S NAME KEEP AWAY
FOR THE OTHERS HAVE HAD THEIR SUPPER AND HOW GLAD SQUINTY WAS WHEN THE FARMER WENT OVER TO THE BARREL WHERE THE PIGS FEED WAS KEPT
BUT AS SHE DID SO THE FINGER AND THUMB REMAINED AND STUCK FAST IN A SHORT TIME AFTER THE SECOND SISTER CAME IN WITH THE FULL EXPECTATION OF GAINING A GOLDEN FEATHER BUT AS SHE TOUCHED HER SISTER TO MOVE HER FROM THE BIRD
I SHALL SOON HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLUCK ONE OF THEM AND SO IT HAPPENED FOR NOT LONG AFTER THE YOUNG MAN LEFT THE ROOM SHE INSTANTLY WENT UP TO THE BIRD AND TOOK HOLD OF ITS WING
WHAT ELSE I FOUND A NICE FIELD OF CORN WENT ON SQUINTY
SQUINTY COULD HEAR THEM TALKING ABOUT HUNTING THE HENS EGGS AND FEEDING THE LITTLE CALVES AND SHEEP AND RIDING ON THE BACKS OF HORSES THEN ONE DAY SQUINTY LOOKED UP OUT OF THE PEN AND LEANING OVER THE TOP BOARD HE SAW THE FARMER THE BOY
SAID SQUINTY I THOUGHT I SAW ANOTHER POTATO BUT WHEN I BIT ON IT
THERE WERE THE SOUNDS OF BOYS AND GIRLS VOICES THEN CAME THE PATTER OF MANY FEET OH LOOK AT THE PIGS SOMEONE CRIED AND SQUINTY AND HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS LOOKING UP SAW OVER THE EDGE OF THE PEN SOME BOYS AND GIRLS LOOKING DOWN ON THEM
NEXT DAY THE SECOND SON WENT INTO THE FOREST TO CUT WOOD AND HIS MOTHER GAVE HIM A CAKE AND A BOTTLE OF WINE AS HE ENTERED THE WOOD THE SAME LITTLE OLD MAN MET HIM AND BEGGED FOR A PIECE OF CAKE AND A DROP OF WINE
WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE CLAN WAS TALKING ANNE AND GIL SIXTY WORDS TO THE MINUTE WELL LAST BIRTHDAY MORNING I WAS FEELING TERRIBLE DISPERRITED I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT MY BIRTHDAY WAS ALWAYS TO BE A GOOD THING FOR OTHER PEOPLE
AND THERE IN THE SAME PLACE SAT A MAN BINDING HIMSELF ROUND TIGHTLY WITH A BELT AND MAKING THE MOST HORRIBLE FACES AS THE YOUTH APPROACHED HE CRIED I HAVE EATEN A WHOLE OVENFUL OF ROLLS
BUT YOU ARE WELCOME TO A SHARE OF IT LET US SIT DOWN AND EAT AND DRINK TOGETHER SO THEY SEATED THEMSELVES AND LO AND BEHOLD WHEN THE YOUTH OPENED HIS BASKET THE CAKE HAD BEEN TURNED INTO A BEAUTIFUL CAKE
BUT THE KING WAS ANNOYED AT THE THOUGHT OF GIVING HIS DAUGHTER TO SUCH A COMMON FELLOW AND TO GET RID OF HIM HE MADE ANOTHER CONDITION HE SAID THAT NO MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS DAUGHTER WHO COULD NOT FIND SOMEONE ABLE TO EAT UP A WHOLE MOUNTAIN OF BREAD
AND EMMA MATILDA DID IT AND ASKED NO QUESTIONS I BROUGHT HER UP THAT WAY THEN I SETTLED DOWN TO WAIT IN LESS THAN A MONTH GILBERT'S MOTHER HAD A LETTER FROM HIM SAYING THAT HE WAS COMING HOME TO SETTLE DOWN AND MARRY ANNE
WHERE DID YOU GO WHAT DID YOU DO
THERE STANDS AN OLD TREE CUT IT DOWN AND YOU WILL FIND SOMETHING GOOD AT THE ROOT THEN THE OLD MAN SAID FAREWELL AND LEFT HIM THE YOUTH SET TO WORK AND VERY SOON SUCCEEDED IN FELLING THE TREE
AND AS HE WALKED QUICKLY THEY WERE OBLIGED TO RUN ONE BEHIND THE OTHER LEFT OR RIGHT OF HIM JUST AS HE WAS INCLINED TO GO IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD THEY WERE MET BY THE PARSON OF THE PARISH WHO LOOKED WITH WONDER AT THE PROCESSION AS IT CAME NEAR HIM
AND WOULD ALWAYS LOVE HIM TO THE DAY OF HER DEATH BUT SHE KNEW HE DIDN'T CARE ANYTHING MORE ABOUT HER AFTER THE WAY HE HAD ACTED AND THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR HER IN LIFE BUT TO DO SOMETHING FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND SO ON AND SO ON FOR TWELVE MORTAL PAGES
OF COURSE YOUR LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER MAY NOT HAVE INTENDED TO RUN AWAY
AND WITH THAT THE GATE BANGED AND THERE WAS NANCY JANE WHITMORE'S BOY SAM WITH TWO LETTERS FOR ME ONE WAS FROM ANNE UP AT SAINT MARY'S AND THE OTHER WAS FROM GIL OUT IN MANITOBA I READ ANNE'S FIRST
ANOTHER NEPHEW OF MINE JAMES EBENEZER LAWSON HE CALLS HIMSELF JAMES E BACK THERE IN TOWN AND I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR I NEVER COULD STAND EBENEZER FOR A NAME MYSELF BUT THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE WELL HE SAID THEIR LOVE WAS IDYLLIC
SHE TAUGHT SCHOOL HERE THREE YEARS AGO AFORE YOUR FOLKS MOVED OVER FROM TALCOTT
YES YES CRIED THE FARMER AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING TO THE PIGS I'M COMING AS FAST AS I CAN SOON THE FARMER POURED SOME SOUR MILK AND CORN MEAL DOWN INTO THE TROUGH AND HOW EAGERLY SQUINTY AND THE OTHERS DID EAT IT
YES I WANT A PIG VERY MUCH THE BOY SAID AND I THINK I'D LIKE THAT ONE AND HE POINTED STRAIGHT AT SQUINTY POOR SQUINTY RAN AND TRIED TO HIDE UNDER THE STRAW FOR HE KNEW THE BOY WAS TALKING ABOUT HIM
SQUINTY THOUGHT SO HIMSELF FOR THE SMELL OF THE SOUR MILK THAT HAD BEEN IN THE FEEDING TROUGH MADE HIM MORE HUNGRY THAN EVER SQUINTY WALKED OVER AND TRIED TO FIND A FEW DROPS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE WOODEN TROUGH THESE HE LICKED UP WITH HIS RED TONGUE
OH SEE HIM RUN CRIED THE BOY YES I THINK HE IS THE NICEST PIG IN THE LOT I WANT HIM HAS HE ANY NAME WELL WE CALL HIM SQUINTY THE FARMER SAID HE HAS A FUNNY SQUINTING EYE
BUT SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE WHY SHE SHOULD KEEP AWAY IF THEY WERE NEAR THE GOLDEN BIRD WHY SHOULD NOT SHE BE THERE SO SHE MADE A SPRING FORWARD AND TOUCHED HER SECOND SISTER AND IMMEDIATELY SHE ALSO WAS MADE A PRISONER

AND IN OTHERS VERY LOW THIS IS DUE TO TWO CAUSES IF WE SHOULD SEND UP A BALLOON CONTAINING AIR RAREFIED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IT WOULD CONTINUE TO ASCEND ONLY UNTIL IT REACHED A POINT WHERE THE OUTSIDE AIR
I WENT ROUND AND FOUND THE SEED WAS ALL GONE IT HAD BEEN CUT OFF AT THE TOP OF THE STALK SO THAT THE UMBEL SHAPED HEADS HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY WHOLE I LOOKED ABOUT AND LUCKILY FOUND THREE SLIGHTLY HOLLOW PLACES UNDER THE BANK AT THE BACK OF THE BORDER
AND IT APPEARED TO ME TO BE MERELY IN THE CHOICE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG PLACING PLACING MONOTONOUSLY OR STUPIDLY SO AS MERELY TO FILL THE SPACE
SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH IT AS WE DO THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS IF HOWEVER THE BODY OF AIR THAT IS SATURATED WITH THIS INVISIBLE MOISTURE BECOMES SUDDENLY CHILLED THE MOISTURE CONDENSES INTO CLOUD OR MIST
AND THEN SENDS OUT THREADY RUNNING ROOTS ALL ROUND A FOOT OR MORE LONG THESE IF NOT CHECKED ESTABLISH NEW BASES OF OPERATION AND SO IT GOES ON ALWAYS SPREADING FARTHER AND FARTHER
EACH MATURE BULB MAKES A HOST OF OFFSETS AND THE SEED QUICKLY RIPENS WHEN IT IS ONCE IN A GARDEN IT WILL SUDDENLY APPEAR IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PLACES IT IS NO USE TRYING TO DIG IT OUT
THE PROCESS OF EVAPORATION IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN THE CATALOGUE OF NATURE'S DYNAMICS WITHOUT IT THERE WOULD BE NO VERDURE ON THE HILLS NO TREES ON THE PLAINS NO FIELDS OF WAVING GRAIN
AND THAT RIPEN THE GRAPES AS WELL I AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS MICE OR BIRDS THAT PICK OFF THE FLOWERS OF THE BIG BUNCH PRIMROSES BUT AM INCLINED TO THINK IT IS MICE BECAUSE THE STALKS ARE CUT LOW DOWN
IF THE AIR IS CHARGED TO SATURATION WITH MOISTURE AT A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE IT WILL REMAIN SO AND EVAPORATION STOPS SO LONG AS THE TEMPERATURE REMAINS UNCHANGED IF ITS TEMPERATURE RISES THE PROCESS OF EVAPORATION CAN START UP
IF THESE GLOBULES ARE IN AN ADVANCED STAGE OF CONDENSATION THE CLOUD IS DARKER AND MORE OPAQUE IN EARLIER CONDITIONS OF CONDENSATION THE CLOUD WILL HAVE A BRIGHT LOOK WHICH SHOWS THAT IT REFLECTS MOST OF THE LIGHT
THERE IS A PROCESS GOING ON AT THE SURFACE CALLED EVAPORATION THIS PROCESS IS MUCH MORE RAPID UNDER THE ACTION OF HEAT THAN WHEN IT IS COLDER IN OTHER WORDS AS THE HEAT INCREASES
DRESSED FOR SPRING AND DRESSED FOR EARLY AUTUMN IS EXACTLY WHAT IS WANTED NOT NECESSARILY FROM ANY SPECIAL LOVE OF FLOWERS BUT AS A KIND OF BRIGHT AND WELL KEPT FURNISHING OF THE IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT OF THE HOUSE THE GARDENER DELIGHTS IN IT
AND WELL KNOW WHAT A DESPAIRING JOB IT IS TO GET THE BITS OF EITHER OF THESE ROOTS OUT OF THE STIFF CLODS THE MOST PERSISTENT WEED IN MY SOIL IS THE SMALL RUNNING SHEEP'S SORREL FIRST IT MAKES A PATCH
AND THE CLOUDS PRECEDE THE RAIN HENCE ALL THE ARTIFICIAL ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE RAIN IN THESE ARID REGIONS HAVE BEEN FUTILE IF A BODY OF WARM AIR WHEN SATURATED WITH INVISIBLE MOISTURE
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO WEEDS AND PESTS WEEDING IS A DELIGHTFUL OCCUPATION ESPECIALLY AFTER SUMMER RAIN WHEN THE ROOTS COME UP CLEAR AND CLEAN
IN THE PARTERRE OF THE FORMAL GARDEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY IN PLACE AND BRILLIANTLY BEAUTIFUL PICTURES CAN BE MADE BY A WISE CHOICE OF COLOURING I ONCE SAW AND CAN NEVER FORGET
IN MY OWN CASE I HAVE ALWAYS DEVOTED THE MOST CAREFUL CONSIDERATION TO ANY BIT OF WILD GARDENING I THOUGHT OF DOING NEVER ALLOWING MYSELF TO DECIDE UPON IT TILL I FELT THOROUGHLY ASSURED THAT THE PLACE SEEMED TO ASK FOR THE PLANTING IN CONTEMPLATION
AND I PASSED IT ALL SEVERAL TIMES THROUGH MY FINGERS BUT ALL IN VAIN I CONFESS THAT IT BEATS ME ENTIRELY CORONILLA VARIA IS A LITTLE PLANT THAT APPEARS IN CATALOGUES AMONG DESIRABLE ALPINES
AND WILL EAT ROSE BUSHES QUITE HIGH UP PLANTS EATEN BY A HARE LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CUT WITH A SHARP KNIFE THERE IS NO APPEARANCE OF GNAWING OR NIBBLING NO RAGGED EDGES OF WOOD OR FRAYED BARK
THESE ARE BEDDING PLANTS WHEN I READ THIS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HIS ARGUMENT WAS THESE PLANTS MAY BE VERY GOOD PLANTS IN THEMSELVES BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOR SOME YEARS BEEN USED WRONGLY THEREFORE THEY MUST NOT NOW BE USED RIGHTLY
IT IS ALL ROUTINE WORK SO MANY HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF SCARLET GERANIUM OF YELLOW CALCEOLARIA OF BLUE LOBELIA OF GOLDEN FEVERFEW OR OF OTHER COLOURED MATERIAL IT WANTS NO IMAGINATION
WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN SOFT GROUND THAT CAN BE HOED AND WEEDED IT MATTERS LESS BUT IN THE LAWN IT IS A MORE SERIOUS MATTER
AS THEY STEPPED ON TO THE FLOOR OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ROUND MISSUS KNIGHTLEY SMILED SHE LOOKED TO ME LIKE AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN THAT HAD COME BY CHANCE INTO THE OTHER PLACE AND HADN'T FOUND OUT HER MISTAKE I SAW STARLIGHT START AS HE LOOKED AT HER
DID IT OFTEN HAPPEN DARYA ALEXANDROVNA FELT DISINCLINED TO LEAVE THE PEASANT WOMEN SO INTERESTING TO HER WAS THEIR CONVERSATION SO COMPLETELY IDENTICAL WERE ALL THEIR INTERESTS
YOUR UNCLE DANIEL WILL HAVE HARD WORK TO FIND YOU IF TOBY HAD FOLLOWED HIS INCLINATIONS
ARE CONFINED TO A SHORT SHRIFT AND A HIGH GALLOWS FOR ALL WHO DARE TO OBSTRUCT THE QUEEN'S HIGHWAY
AND THE ANIMALS DID NOT ATTRACT UNTIL HE HAD VISITED THE MONKEY CAGE FOR THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THEN HE FANCIED THAT THE SAME VENERABLE MONKEY WHO HAD LOOKED SO KNOWING IN THE AFTERNOON WAS GAZING AT HIM WITH A SADNESS
AND I CAN'T SAY MORE THAN THAT SO AS I SAID BEFORE IT WAS QUITE A PICTURE TO SEE THEM WALK SLOWLY AND PROUDLY DOWN AND SWEEP INTO THE HALL AS IF THEY'D BEEN MARCHING INTO A BALLROOM
THERE'S NO SAYING WHAT MISTER KNIGHTLEY MIGHT DO IF HIS WIFE HAD BEEN HERE THANK GOD SHE'S AWAY AT BATHURST SAID STARLIGHT I HATE SEEING WOMEN PUT OUT BESIDES EVERYBODY BOWS DOWN TO MISSUS KNIGHTLEY SHE'S AS GOOD AS SHE'S HANDSOME I BELIEVE AND
SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE FOUND THAT THINGS HAD BEEN MADE HOTTER FOR US THAN EVER SINCE WE FIRST TURNED OUT GO WHERE WE WOULD WE FOUND THE POLICE ALWAYS QUICK ON OUR TRAIL
COULDN'T THINK OF GOING BEFORE THE CAPTAIN SAYS MORAN WITH A GRIN I'LL FOLLOW WHERE YOU LEAD ALL RIGHT SAYS STARLIGHT HERE GOES AND HE STARTED TO WALK UPSTAIRS
IN HER FAMILY SHE WAS STRICT IN CARRYING OUT ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED BY THE CHURCH AND NOT MERELY IN ORDER TO SET AN EXAMPLE BUT WITH ALL HER HEART IN IT
SIR FERDINAND WAS ALWAYS ON THE MOVE BUT WE KNEW HE COULDN'T DO IT ALL HIMSELF UNLESS HE GOT THE OFFICE FROM SOME ONE WHO KNEW THE ROPES BETTER THAN HE DID LAST OF ALL WE DROPPED ON TO IT THERE WAS ONE OF THE GOLDFIELDS COMMISSIONERS
HE WOULD HAVE LOITERED IN THE VICINITY OF THE CANDY STAND IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT GAIN SOME INSIGHT INTO THE BUSINESS BUT MISTER LORD ADVISED THAT HE REMAIN AWAY LEST HIS UNCLE DANIEL SHOULD SEE HIM AND SUSPECT WHERE HE HAD GONE WHEN HE WAS MISSED IN THE MORNING
TAKING HIS PIPE OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND LAYING IT DOWN THAT'S THE WAY THEY USED TO TALK TO US IN THE OLD DAYS DASHED IF I DON'T THINK IT'S THE BEST WAY AFTER ALL YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE THE REST'S FLUMMERY
A GOOD TIME NOW BUT I S'POSE I MUST CAUSE
HE WAS STILL LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AND THERE WAS A SOFT SORROWFUL LOOK IN HIS EYES LIKE I REMEMBER NOTICING ONCE BEFORE WHILE HE WAS TALKING TO AILEEN ABOUT HIS EARLY DAYS A THING HE NEVER DID BUT ONCE
OF COURSE HE WAS ON HIS GUARD THEN AND BEFORE LONG THE BULLETS BEGAN TO FLY PRETTY THICK AMONG US AND WE HAD TO TAKE COVER TO RETURN FIRE AND KEEP AS DARK AS WE COULD
NIKOLINKA HAD WHISTLED TOO AND HE WAS NOT PUNISHED AND THAT HE WASN'T CRYING FOR THE TART HE DIDN'T CARE
AND TO BE ABLE TO SEE ITS MANY WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL ATTRACTIONS EVERY DAY EVEN THE VERY TENT ROPES HAD ACQUIRED A NEW INTEREST FOR HIM AND THE FACES OF THE MEN AT WORK SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE BECOME THOSE OF FRIENDS
IT LOOKED AS IF OUR LUCK WAS DEAD OUT AND WE BEGAN TO THINK OUR CHANCE OF GETTING ACROSS THE BORDER TO QUEENSLAND AND CLEAR OUT OF THE COLONY THAT WAY LOOKED WORSE EVERY DAY DAD KEPT FORAGING ABOUT TO GET INFORMATION
BUILT A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO BY A RICH SETTLER WHO WAS ONCE THE OWNER OF ALL THAT SIDE OF THE COUNTRY THE STAIRCASE WAS ALL STONE ORNAMENTED EVERY WAY IT COULD BE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE COULD WALK ABREAST EASY ENOUGH
THEY HAD HARNESSED THANKS TO THE REPRESENTATIONS OF MARYA PHILIMONOVNA THE BAILIFF'S HORSE BROWNIE AND DARYA ALEXANDROVNA DELAYED BY ANXIETY OVER HER OWN ATTIRE CAME OUT AND GOT IN
THERE WE WERE STANDING AND LEANING ABOUT THE DARK HALL STARING AND WONDERING AND THESE PEOPLE WALKING DOWN TO MEET US LIKE GHOSTS WITHOUT SPEAKING OR ANYTHING ELSE MISTER KNIGHTLEY WAS A TALL HANDSOME MAN
THAT NIGHT DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS GOING TO TRAVEL WITH THE CIRCUS DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS HOME WAS NOT A HAPPY OR CHEERFUL ONE TOBY WAS NOT IN A PLEASANT FRAME OF MIND HE BEGAN TO FEEL FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT
BUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WHAT MAY BE CONSIDERED THE LEGALISED ROBBERY OF THE BETTING RING HAS NOT LEVIED CONTRIBUTIONS RATHER THE OTHER WAY INDEED
ONLY I COULD SEE THAT HIS FACE HAD THAT SET LOOK HE ONLY GOT NOW AND THEN AND HIS EYES BEGAN TO SHOW OUT A FIERCE LIGHT AT LAST WE BEGAN TO SEE THAT THE RETURN FIRE WAS SLACKING OFF WHILE OURS WAS AS BRISK AS EVER
AND FALLS BACKARDS AND BREAKS HIS NECK IF HE AIN'T WATCHED WHOSE BUSINESS WAS IT TO HAVE LEARNED ME BETTER THAT I CAN'T RIGHTLY SAY BUT IT SEEMED IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE TO GAOL ME AND IRON ME AND FLOG ME WAS THAT JUSTICE
A WINK FROM MISTER LORD MUST HAVE BEEN INTENDED TO CONVEY A GREAT DEAL BECAUSE OWING TO THE DEFECT IN HIS EYES IT REQUIRED NO LITTLE EXERTION AND EVEN THEN COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A REALLY FIRST CLASS WINK
WAS A GREAT PLEASURE TO HER WHEN HALF THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN DRESSED SOME PEASANT WOMEN IN HOLIDAY DRESS OUT PICKING HERBS CAME UP TO THE BATHING SHED AND STOPPED SHYLY MARYA
ANYHOW I'LL TRY FOR THAT BARREL THERE AND IF I GET BEHIND IT I CAN FIRE FROM SHORT RANGE AND MAKE HIM COME OUT HE MADE A RUSH HALF ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND MANAGED TO GET BEHIND THIS BARREL WHERE HE WAS SAFE FROM BEING HIT AS LONG AS HE KEPT WELL BEHIND IT
AND AS THERE IS NO GOOD REASON WHY THEIR BUILDERS SHOULD HAVE AVOIDED ERECTING THEM ON THAT TERRACE WHILE THEY RAISED THEM PROMISCUOUSLY ON ALL THE OTHERS IT FOLLOWS NOT UNREASONABLY
THE HEAD WATERS OF THE MISSOURI BECAME ONE OF THEIR GREAT CENTRES OF POPULATION BUT THEIR CHIEF SITES WERE UPON THE MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO RIVERS IN WISCONSIN WE FIND THE NORTHERN CENTRAL LIMIT OF THEIR WORK THEY SEEM TO HAVE OCCUPIED THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF THE STATE AND THE WESTERN SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN
THE JOINTS ARE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND NOT WIDER THAN THE THICKNESS OF SILVER PAPER AND THE CEMENT SO TENACIOUS THAT FRAGMENTS OF THE CASING STONES STILL REMAIN IN THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION NOTWITHSTANDING THE LAPSE OF SO MANY CENTURIES AND THE VIOLENCE BY WHICH THEY WERE DETACHED
STILL RETAIN THEIR POLISH AND BEAR MARKS WHICH SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THEY WERE TURNED IN SOME MACHINE INSTEAD OF BEING CARVED OR RUBBED INTO SHAPE BY HAND NOT AMONG THE LEAST INTERESTING AND REMARKABLE RELICS CONTINUES THE SAME AUTHOR
ON A COMPOSITION OF SILK AND GUM AND ON A SPECIES OF PAPER SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL MADE FROM THE ALOE THEIR BOOKS WERE ABOUT THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF OUR OWN BUT THE LEAVES WERE LONG STRIPS FOLDED TOGETHER IN MANY FOLDS THEY WROTE POETRY AND CULTIVATED ORATORY
THEIR WOMEN SAYS THE SAME AUTHOR ARE DESCRIBED BY THE SPANIARDS AS PRETTY THOUGH WITH A SERIOUS AND RATHER MELANCHOLY CAST OF COUNTENANCE THEIR LONG BLACK HAIR MIGHT GENERALLY BE SEEN WREATHED WITH FLOWERS OR AMONG THE RICHER PEOPLE
AT MYCENAE ON PAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR ONE OF THE OLDEST STRUCTURES IN GREECE WE FIND PRECISELY THE SAME FORM OF ARCH FILLED IN IN THE SAME WAY ROSENGARTEN
WE FIND IN THE MOUNDS ADZES SIMILAR IN SHAPE TO OUR OWN WITH THE EDGES BEVELLED FROM THE INSIDE DRILLS AND GRAVERS OF COPPER HAVE ALSO BEEN FOUND WITH CHISEL SHAPED EDGES OR SHARP POINTS IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE SAYS SQUIER
IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM CERTAIN ANIMALS WERE DOMESTICATED BY THE ABORIGINES FROM SO REMOTE A PERIOD THAT SCARCELY ANY OF THEIR SPECIES AS IN THE CASE OF THE LAMA OF PERU WERE TO BE FOUND IN A STATE OF UNRESTRAINED FREEDOM AT THE ADVENT OF THE SPANIARDS
COLUMBUS FOUND THE NATIVES MAKING SUCH VOYAGES IN OPEN CANOES IF THEN WE WILL SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS NO ORIGINAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INHABITANTS OF THE MAIN LAND AND OF ATLANTIS THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY OF THE ATLANTEANS WOULD SOON REVEAL TO THEM THE SHORES OF THE GULF
IT IS SIX INCHES IN LENGTH TWO IN BREADTH AND WEIGHS ONE OUNCE
AND RA WAS THE SUN GOD OF EGYPT
AND THE VASTNESS OF THE REALM MAY BE JUDGED BY THE FACT THAT EACH OF THESE COULD MUSTER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VASSALS FROM THEIR OWN ESTATES OR A TOTAL OF THREE MILLIONS AND WE HAVE ONLY TO READ OF THE VAST HORDES BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD AGAINST CORTEZ TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS NOT AN EXAGGERATION
THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CIVILIZATION OF THIS PEOPLE ADVANCED UP THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND SPREAD OUT OVER ITS TRIBUTARIES BUT DID NOT CROSS THE ALLEGHANY
THE BOWLS OF MOST OF THE STONE PIPES ARE CARVED IN MINIATURE FIGURES OF ANIMALS BIRDS REPTILES ET CETERA ALL OF THEM ARE EXECUTED WITH STRICT FIDELITY TO NATURE AND WITH EXQUISITE SKILL NOT ONLY ARE THE FEATURES OF THE OBJECTS FAITHFULLY REPRESENTED
CHAPTER TWO THE EGYPTIAN COLONY WHAT PROOFS HAVE WE THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE A COLONY FROM ATLANTIS
WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT SOME OF THEIR PORPHYRY CARVINGS WILL TURN THE EDGE OF THE BEST TEMPERED KNIFE WE ARE FORCED TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY POSSESSED THAT SINGULAR PROCESS KNOWN TO THE MEXICANS AND PERUVIANS OF TEMPERING COPPER TO THE HARDNESS OF STEEL
WHAT WOULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN THAT THESE ADVENTUROUS NAVIGATORS PASSING AROUND THE SHORES OF THE GULF SHOULD SOONER OR LATER DISCOVER THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND WHAT MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT THEY WOULD ENTER IT EXPLORE IT AND PLANT COLONIES ALONG ITS SHORES WHEREVER THEY FOUND A FERTILE SOIL AND A SALUBRIOUS CLIMATE
THEY HAVE BEEN ASTOUNDED AND OVERCOME BY THE MAGNIFICENCE AND THE PRODIGALITY OF WORKMANSHIP HERE TO BE ADMIRED COURTS HALLS GATE WAYS PILLARS
TO USE THE WORDS OF A RECENT WRITER IN BLACKWOOD
THERE WERE FOUND DEEP EXCAVATIONS WITH RUDE LADDERS HUGE MASSES OF ROCK BROKEN OFF ALSO NUMEROUS STONE TOOLS AND ALL THE EVIDENCES OF EXTENSIVE AND LONG CONTINUED LABOR IT IS EVEN SAID THAT THE GREAT ONTONAGON MASS OF PURE COPPER WHICH IS NOW IN WASHINGTON WAS EXCAVATED BY THESE ANCIENT MINERS
RUINS WHICH AT FIRST MAKE NO IMPRESSION SO COMPLETE IS THEIR DILAPIDATION HE ASSERTS THE GREAT ANTIQUITY OF THESE RUINS BECAUSE HE FOUND THE VERY HIGHWAYS OF THE ANCIENT CITY TO BE COMPOSED OF BROKEN BRICKS AND POTTERY THE DEBRIS LEFT BY EARLIER POPULATIONS
IN QUARRYING ROCK IN BUILDING AND IN SCULPTURE THE EXPLANATION IS SIMPLE THE WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC NOW FLOW OVER THE COUNTRY WHERE ALL THIS MAGNIFICENCE AND POWER WERE DEVELOPED BY SLOW STAGES FROM THE RUDE BEGINNINGS OF BARBARISM
MONOLITHIC FIGURES SCULPTURES ROWS OF SPHINXES ARE MASSED IN SUCH PROFUSION THAT THE SIGHT IS TOO MUCH FOR MODERN COMPREHENSION DENON SAYS
INSTEAD OF EXHIBITING THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF ANY BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE THEY TEND TO PROVE THAT NOTHING HAD ANY RISE OR PROGRESS BUT THAT EVERYTHING IS REFERABLE TO THE VERY EARLIEST DATES THE EXPERIENCE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST
THEIR DENSEST SETTLEMENTS AND GREATEST WORKS WERE NEAR THE MISSISSIPPI AND ITS TRIBUTARIES SAYS FOSTER
WAS FOUND IN A MOUND IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF CHILLICOTHE IT IS COMPOSED OF A COMPACT VARIETY OF SLATE THIS STONE CUTS WITH GREAT CLEARNESS AND RECEIVES A FINE THOUGH NOT GLARING POLISH
WITH BLUE FIGURES ON A WHITE GROUND ALSO BRONZE COMPOSED OF THE SAME ELEMENTS OF COPPER AND TIN IN LIKE PROPORTIONS COINS MADE OF COPPER ROUND AND T SHAPED AND EVEN METALLIC CANDLESTICKS
A RUDE ARTICLE IN THE SHAPE OF AN AXE COMPOSED OF PURE LEAD WEIGHING ABOUT HALF A POUND WAS FOUND IN SINKING A WELL WITHIN THE TRENCH OF THE ANCIENT WORKS AT CIRCLEVILLE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT IT WAS THE PRODUCTION OF THE MOUND BUILDERS AS GALENA HAS OFTEN BEEN FOUND ON THE ALTARS IN THE MOUNDS
TILL THE SPACE AT THE HIGHEST COURSE BECOMES SO NARROW THAT A SINGLE STONE COVERS IT
SO THAT THE SPACE ENCLOSED BY EACH MIGHT EXACTLY CORRESPOND
THE TABLE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH SUBSTANTIAL MEATS ESPECIALLY GAME AMONG WHICH THE MOST CONSPICUOUS WAS THE TURKEY ALSO THERE WERE FOUND VERY DELICIOUS VEGETABLES AND FRUITS OF EVERY VARIETY NATIVE TO THE CONTINENT
FORMING CONTINUOUS LINES AS IN THE STREETS OF MODERN CITIES STILL ALL THESE EDIFICES AND HALLS WERE AS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE VAST SUBSTRUCTURES WHICH STRENGTHENED THEIR FOUNDATIONS WE FIND THE STRONGEST RESEMBLANCES TO THE WORKS OF THE ANCIENT EUROPEAN RACES
WITH STRINGS OF PRECIOUS STONES AND PEARLS FROM THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA
AT HOPETOWN OHIO ARE TWO WALLED FIGURES ONE A SQUARE THE OTHER A CIRCLE EACH CONTAINING PRECISELY TWENTY ACRES
MOST COURTEOUSLY REFUSED TRIM'S OFFER TILL TRIM TELLING HIM HE HAD HALF A DOZEN MORE IN BOHEMIA
GALLANT MORTAL CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY CAUGHT UP WITH ENTHUSIASM THIS MOMENT NOW THAT ALL IS LOST I SEE HIM GALLOPING ACROSS ME CORPORAL TO THE LEFT TO BRING UP THE REMAINS OF THE ENGLISH HORSE ALONG WITH HIM TO SUPPORT THE RIGHT
THOU ART RIGHT TRIM IN BOTH CASES SAID MY UNCLE TOBY THIS CONTINUED THE CORPORAL IS THE REASON THAT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THEIR DEMOLITION TO THE END I HAVE NEVER ONCE WHISTLED OR SUNG OR LAUGH'D OR CRY'D OR TALK'D OF PAST DONE DEEDS
THAT THOU ART ABOUT TO OBSERVE NOTHING IN THIS WORLD TRIM IS MADE TO LAST FOR EVER BUT WHEN TOKENS DEAR TOM OF THY LOVE AND REMEMBRANCE WEAR OUT SAID TRIM WHAT SHALL WE SAY THERE IS NO OCCASION TRIM QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY
WAS IT A WONDER IF NOW AND THEN IT PUT HIS CENTRE INTO DISORDER THE DUCE TAKE IT SAID MY UNCLE TOBY
AS IS PLAIN TO ME FROM THE PRESENT MISERABLE STATE OF MILITARY ARCHITECTURE AMONGST THEM
IT DID NOT ALTOGETHER STRIKE THE CORPORAL'S FANCY WHEN HE HAD MADE IT BUT IT COULD NOT BE RECALL'D SO HE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT PROCEED AS THE NUMBER OF WOUNDED WAS PRODIGIOUS AND NO ONE HAD TIME TO THINK OF ANY THING BUT HIS OWN SAFETY THOUGH TALMASH
AND THE FOREFINGER AND THUMB BEING ONCE ENGAGED AS NATURALLY BROUGHT IN THE WHOLE HAND THINE DEAR UNCLE TOBY
OR DIVERT ME IN MY GRAVE ONES THOU HAST SELDOM TOLD ME A BAD ONE BECAUSE AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR
THE THING COULD HAVE HAPPEN'D NO WAY THE CORPORAL MADE THE BOW OF UNFEIGN'D CONVICTION AND WENT ON NOW THE KING OF BOHEMIA WITH HIS QUEEN AND COURTIERS HAPPENING ONE FINE SUMMER'S EVENING TO WALK OUT AYE
LEAVE OUT THE DATE ENTIRELY TRIM QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY LEANING FORWARDS AND LAYING HIS HAND GENTLY UPON THE CORPORAL'S SHOULDER TO TEMPER THE INTERRUPTION LEAVE IT OUT ENTIRELY TRIM A STORY PASSES VERY WELL WITHOUT THESE NICETIES
THAT TAKING GREAT PLEASURE AND DELIGHT IN NAVIGATION AND ALL SORT OF SEA AFFAIRS AND THERE HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE KINGDOM OF BOHEMIA TO BE NO SEA PORT TOWN WHATEVER HOW THE DUCE SHOULD THERE TRIM CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY FOR BOHEMIA BEING TOTALLY INLAND
AND THE DISPOSITION I AM IN AT PRESENT WOULD WRONG BOTH THEE TRIM AND THY STORY IT IS NOT A MERRY ONE BY ANY MEANS REPLIED THE CORPORAL NOR WOULD I HAVE IT ALTOGETHER A GRAVE ONE ADDED MY UNCLE TOBY IT IS NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER REPLIED THE CORPORAL
THE FORTIFICATIONS ARE QUITE DESTROYED
THEY ARE ALL TRUE FOR THEY ARE ABOUT MYSELF I DO NOT LIKE THE SUBJECT THE WORSE TRIM SAID MY UNCLE TOBY ON THAT SCORE BUT PRITHEE WHAT IS THIS STORY THOU HAST EXCITED MY CURIOSITY
THEN WHEELING ABOUT AND CHARGING CONTI AT THE HEAD OF IT BRAVE BRAVE BY HEAVEN CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY HE DESERVES A CROWN AS RICHLY AS A THIEF A HALTER SHOUTED TRIM MY UNCLE TOBY KNEW THE CORPORAL'S LOYALTY
IT'S HIGH TIME I SHOULD SAID MY UNCLE TOBY YOUR HONOUR REMEMBERS WITH CONCERN SAID THE CORPORAL THE TOTAL ROUT AND CONFUSION OF OUR CAMP AND ARMY AT THE AFFAIR OF LANDEN EVERY ONE WAS LEFT TO SHIFT FOR HIMSELF
I THINK SO TOO REPLIED MY UNCLE TOBY WITH A SIGH HALF SUPPRESS'D BUT STEP INTO THE PARLOUR TRIM FOR THE STIPULATION IT LIES UPON THE TABLE IT HAS LAIN THERE THESE SIX WEEKS REPLIED THE CORPORAL TILL THIS VERY MORNING THAT THE OLD WOMAN KINDLED THE FIRE WITH IT
THIS UNFORTUNATE KING OF BOHEMIA SAID TRIM WAS HE UNFORTUNATE THEN CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY FOR HE HAD BEEN SO WRAPT UP IN HIS DISSERTATION UPON GUN POWDER AND OTHER MILITARY AFFAIRS THAT THO HE HAD DESIRED THE CORPORAL TO GO ON
THAT OF ALL OTHERS IT SEEMS A SCIENCE WHICH THE SOLDIER MIGHT BEST SPARE WAS IT NOT FOR THE LIGHTS WHICH THAT SCIENCE MUST ONE DAY GIVE HIM IN DETERMINING THE INVENTION OF POWDER THE FURIOUS EXECUTION OF WHICH RENVERSING EVERY THING LIKE THUNDER BEFORE IT
SO ORNAMENT IT AFTER THY OWN FASHION AND TAKE ANY DATE CONTINUED MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING PLEASANTLY UPON HIM TAKE ANY DATE IN THE WHOLE WORLD THOU CHUSEST AND PUT IT TO THOU ART HEARTILY WELCOME THE CORPORAL BOWED FOR OF EVERY CENTURY
BESIDES SAID THE CORPORAL RESUMING THE DISCOURSE BUT IN A GAYER ACCENT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT SINGLE SHOT I HAD NEVER AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR BEEN IN LOVE SO THOU WAST ONCE IN LOVE TRIM SAID MY UNCLE TOBY SMILING
NEITHER AT THIS END OR THAT BUT LIKE A PRODIGAL'S CANDLE TO LIGHT HIM IF POSSIBLE AT BOTH ENDS AT ONCE NOW THROUGH ALL THE LUMBER ROOMS OF MILITARY FURNITURE INCLUDING BOTH OF HORSE AND FOOT
QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY INTERRUPTING HIM AS HE MENTIONED THE BLIND GUT IN A DISCOURSE WITH MY FATHER THE NIGHT MY MOTHER WAS BROUGHT TO BED OF ME I BESEECH YOU QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY TO TELL ME WHICH IS THE BLIND GUT FOR OLD AS I AM I VOW I DO NOT KNOW TO THIS DAY WHERE IT LIES
THE FATES WHO CERTAINLY ALL FORE KNEW OF THESE AMOURS OF WIDOW WADMAN AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD FROM THE FIRST CREATION OF MATTER AND MOTION AND WITH MORE COURTESY THAN THEY USUALLY DO THINGS OF THIS KIND ESTABLISHED SUCH A CHAIN OF CAUSES AND EFFECTS HANGING SO FAST TO ONE ANOTHER
TO TAKE HOLD OF THE MAP OR PLAN OR UPRIGHT OR WHATEVER IT WAS AND WITH OUT STRETCHED NECK MEETING IT HALF WAY TO ADVANCE IT TOWARDS HER ON WHICH MY UNCLE TOBY'S PASSIONS WERE SURE TO CATCH FIRE FOR HE WOULD INSTANTLY TAKE HOLD OF THE OTHER CORNER OF THE MAP IN HIS LEFT HAND
BUT WILL SUIT YOUR HONOUR EXACTLY THEN I'LL THANK THEE FOR IT WITH ALL MY HEART CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY SO PRITHEE BEGIN IT TRIM THE CORPORAL MADE HIS REVERENCE AND THOUGH IT IS NOT SO EASY A MATTER AS THE WORLD IMAGINES TO PULL OFF A LANK MONTERO CAP
AND THAT THE CHINESE ADDED MY UNCLE TOBY EMBARRASS US AND ALL ACCOUNTS OF IT STILL MORE BY BOASTING OF THE INVENTION SOME HUNDREDS OF YEARS EVEN BEFORE HIM THEY ARE A PACK OF LIARS I BELIEVE CRIED TRIM THEY ARE SOMEHOW OR OTHER DECEIVED SAID MY UNCLE TOBY IN THIS MATTER
LARGE ENOUGH FOR ANY SENTIMENT TO PASS OR RE PASS WHICH A PERSON SKILL'D IN THE ELEMENTARY AND PRACTICAL PART OF LOVE MAKING HAS OCCASION FOR BY BRINGING UP HER FOREFINGER PARALLEL AS BEFORE TO MY UNCLE TOBY'S IT UNAVOIDABLY BROUGHT THE THUMB INTO ACTION
TO SAY ANY THING ELSE AND WAS A MAN TO PUZZLE HIS BRAINS TILL DOOM'S DAY I BELIEVE TRIM IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THE CORPORAL PERCEIVING MY UNCLE TOBY WAS IN THE RIGHT AND THAT IT WOULD BE IN VAIN FOR THE WIT OF MAN TO THINK OF EXTRACTING A PURER MORAL FROM HIS CAP
AND BROUGHT A WHOLE APRON FULL DOWN WITH HER THE MOTHER TOOK THEM FROM HER AND INSTEAD OF BEHAVING BETTER TO POOR LITTLE TWO EYES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
WHEN THE KNIGHT WHO WAS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN RODE UP HE WONDERED TO SEE THE MARVELLOUS TREE OF GOLD AND SILVER AND SAID TO THE TWO SISTERS WHOSE IS THIS BEAUTIFUL TREE WHOEVER WILL GIVE ME A TWIG OF IT SHALL HAVE WHATEVER SHE WANTS
THEN HE TOOK ONE OF THE GOATS AND TIED IT TO A POST IN THE COURTYARD AND GAVE IT SOME GRASS TO EAT BUT HE BOUND A CORD ROUND THE NECK OF THE OTHER GOAT AND LED IT TO THE MARKET
AND ASKED WHERE THEY CAME FROM LITTLE ONE EYE AND LITTLE THREE EYES ANSWERED THAT THEY HAD ANOTHER SISTER BUT SHE COULD NOT BE SEEN BECAUSE SHE HAD ONLY TWO EYES LIKE ORDINARY PEOPLE BUT THE KNIGHT DEMANDED TO SEE HER AND CALLED OUT LITTLE TWO EYES COME FORTH
AND IN HIS RAGE HE THRUST HIS KNIFE INTO HER BREAST SO THAT SHE FELL DEAD ON THE GROUND THEN HE TOOK SIMON'S PIPE AND BLEW INTO IT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN THE HOPES OF CALLING HIS WIFE BACK TO LIFE BUT HE BLEW IN VAIN FOR THE POOR SOUL WAS AS DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL
AND WAS VERY SOON LOST TO SIGHT AND AS FAR AS I KNOW WAS NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN WHEN THE DINNER HOUR APPROACHED ALL THREE WENT HOME AND ASKED THEIR WIVES IF THE GOAT HAD RETURNED WITH THE NECESSARY PROVISIONS AND HAD TOLD THEM WHAT THEY WISHED PREPARED FOR THEIR MEAL
THE SIMPLE MINDED SHEPHERD WHO BELIEVED HIS STORY IMPLICITLY ASKED HIM DO YOU THINK THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WOULD GIVE HIS DAUGHTER TO ME YES CERTAINLY I KNOW HE WOULD ANSWERED SIMON IF YOU WERE TIED UP IN THIS SACK INSTEAD OF ME
MY FRIENDS THIS MULE MUST BE OURS BEFORE WE ARE MANY HOURS OLDER BUT HOW SHALL WE MANAGE IT ASKED ONE OF THEM WE MUST ALL THREE STATION OURSELVES AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS ALONG THE OLD MAN'S HOMEWARD WAY AND MUST EACH IN HIS TURN DECLARE THAT THE MULE HE HAS BOUGHT IS A DONKEY
AND SHE FELT SHE HAD BEEN DISGRACED AND PUT TO SHAME TILL HER LIFE'S END THEN JACK MY HEDGEHOG RODE ON WITH HIS COCK AND BAGPIPES TO THE COUNTRY OF THE SECOND KING TO WHOM HE HAD SHOWN THE WAY
THEN LITTLE TWO EYES CAME TO HER AND WOKE HER AND SAID WELL LITTLE THREE EYES HAVE YOU BEEN ASLEEP YOU WATCH WELL COME WE WILL GO HOME WHEN THEY REACHED HOME LITTLE TWO EYES DID NOT EAT AGAIN AND LITTLE THREE EYES SAID TO THE MOTHER
WHEN THE HANDSOME KNIGHT CARRIED LITTLE TWO EYES AWAY WITH HIM THE TWO SISTERS ENVIED HER GOOD LUCK AT FIRST BUT THE WONDERFUL TREE IS STILL WITH US AFTER ALL THEY THOUGHT AND ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT BREAK ANY FRUIT FROM IT EVERYONE WILL STOP AND LOOK AT IT
COME LITTLE ONE EYE WE WILL SIT DOWN HERE AND I WILL SING YOU SOMETHING LITTLE ONE EYE SAT DOWN
THE GOAT WHICH WHEN I SAID THE LITTLE RHYME SPREAD THE TABLE SO BEAUTIFULLY MY MOTHER HAS KILLED AND NOW I MUST SUFFER HUNGER AND WANT AGAIN THE WISE WOMAN SAID LITTLE TWO EYES I WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD PIECE OF ADVICE
AND FASTENED THEM UP SO TIGHTLY THAT THEY COULDN'T GET OUT AND THEN HE THREW THEM ALL INTO THE RIVER
I'LL LAY ALL THE BLAME ON YOU AND WILL PRETEND TO BE SO ANGRY WITH YOU THAT I WILL RUN AT YOU WITH MY KNIFE AND PIERCE THE BLADDER WITH IT THEN YOU MUST FALL ON THE GROUND AS IF YOU WERE DEAD AND LEAVE THE REST TO ME HARDLY HAD SIMON SAID THESE WORDS WHEN THE THREE ROGUES APPEARED AND FELL ON HIM TO KILL HIM
BUT THE ONE IN MY FOREHEAD REMAINED AWAKE LUCKILY THEN THE ENVIOUS MOTHER CRIED OUT WILL YOU FARE BETTER THAN WE DO YOU SHALL NOT HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO SO AGAIN AND SHE FETCHED A KNIFE AND KILLED THE GOAT WHEN LITTLE TWO EYES SAW THIS
THE BITER BIT ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A MAN CALLED SIMON WHO WAS VERY RICH BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS STINGY AND MISERLY AS HE COULD BE HE HAD A HOUSEKEEPER CALLED NINA A
THEN THE MOTHER SAID TO LITTLE ONE EYE CLIMB UP MY CHILD AND BREAK US OFF THE FRUIT FROM THE TREE LITTLE ONE EYE CLIMBED UP BUT JUST WHEN SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE HOLD OF ONE OF THE GOLDEN APPLES THE BOUGH SPRANG OUT OF HER HANDS AND THIS HAPPENED EVERY TIME
JACK WAS RELEASED FROM HIS ENCHANTMENT AND LAY IN HIS BED A MAN FROM HEAD TO FOOT BUT QUITE BLACK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SEVERELY SCORCHED THE KING SENT OFF FOR HIS PHYSICIAN IN ORDINARY WHO WASHED JACK ALL OVER WITH VARIOUS ESSENCES AND SALVES
THEN SHE ASKED WHERE HE HAD BEEN WANDERING SO LONG AND HE TOLD HER HOW HE HAD LOST HIS WAY AND MIGHT NEVER HAVE REACHED HOME AT ALL BUT FOR A STRANGE CREATURE HALF MAN HALF HEDGEHOG WHICH RODE A COCK AND SAT UP IN A TREE MAKING LOVELY MUSIC AND WHICH HAD SHOWN HIM THE RIGHT WAY
WHEN THEY RETIRED TO REST THE PRINCESS FEARED LEST JACK SHOULD KISS HER BECAUSE OF HIS PRICKLES BUT HE TOLD HER NOT TO BE ALARMED AS NO HARM SHOULD BEFALL HER THEN HE BEGGED THE OLD KING TO PLACE A WATCH OF FOUR MEN JUST OUTSIDE HIS BEDROOM DOOR AND TO DESIRE THEM TO MAKE A BIG FIRE
AND THERE THE KING HAD GIVEN STRICT ORDERS THAT IF ANYONE SHOULD BE SEEN RIDING A COCK AND CARRYING A BAGPIPE HE WAS TO BE CHASED AWAY AND SHOT AT AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE PALACE SO WHEN JACK MY HEDGEHOG RODE UP
BUT SHE WAS NOT ANY MORE SUCCESSFUL LOOK ROUND AS SHE MIGHT THE GOLDEN APPLES BENT THEMSELVES BACK AT LAST THE MOTHER GOT IMPATIENT AND CLIMBED UP HERSELF
THEN LITTLE TWO EYES CAME OUT FROM UNDER THE CASK QUITE HAPPILY AND THE KNIGHT WAS ASTONISHED AT HER GREAT BEAUTY AND SAID
DADDY SAID HE DO BRING ME A BAGPIPE WHEN THE FARMER CAME HOME HE GAVE HIS WIFE AND THE MAID THE THINGS THEY HAD ASKED FOR AND THEN HE WENT BEHIND THE STOVE AND GAVE JACK MY HEDGEHOG THE BAGPIPES WHEN JACK HAD GOT HIS BAGPIPES HE SAID
NOW THIS KING HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT IN THE EVENT OF JACK'S COMING THE GUARDS WERE TO PRESENT ARMS THE PEOPLE TO CHEER AND HE WAS TO BE CONDUCTED IN TRIUMPH TO THE ROYAL PALACE WHEN THE KING'S DAUGHTER SAW JACK MY HEDGEHOG SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL STARTLED
I SHOULD BE HAPPY THEN THE KNIGHT LIFTED LITTLE TWO EYES ON HIS HORSE AND TOOK HER HOME TO HIS FATHER'S CASTLE THERE HE GAVE HER BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES AND FOOD AND DRINK AND BECAUSE HE LOVED HER SO MUCH HE MARRIED HER AND THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH GREAT JOY
LITTLE GOAT BLEAT LITTLE TABLE APPEAR AND SCARCELY HAD SHE UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THERE STOOD A LITTLE TABLE BEFORE HER COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH ON WHICH WERE ARRANGED A PLATE
