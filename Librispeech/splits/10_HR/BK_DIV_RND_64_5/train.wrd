THEY WERE NOT ONLY NEW TROUSERS BUT THEY WERE THE FIRST HE HAD EVER HAD WITH BRAID ON THEM
PETER PULLED HER BENEATH THE WATER FOR HOOK HAD STARTED UP CRYING WHAT WAS THAT I HEARD NOTHING SAID STARKEY RAISING THE LANTERN OVER THE WATERS AND AS THE PIRATES LOOKED THEY SAW A STRANGE SIGHT IT WAS THE NEST I HAVE TOLD YOU OF
LIKE THE FACES ON A BAD COINAGE IF ONLY I HAD NOT ACCEPTED THAT INVITATION TO DINE AT TWENTY SEVEN MISSUS DARLING SAID IF ONLY I HAD NOT POURED MY MEDICINE INTO NANA'S BOWL SAID MISTER DARLING IF ONLY I HAD PRETENDED TO LIKE THE MEDICINE
SHE LOOKED OUT AND THE NIGHT WAS PEPPERED WITH STARS
THE GIRL HAD FAINTED AND LAY ON THE BOY'S ARM WITH A LAST EFFORT PETER PULLED HER UP THE ROCK AND THEN LAY DOWN BESIDE HER EVEN AS HE ALSO FAINTED HE SAW THAT THE WATER WAS RISING HE KNEW THAT THEY WOULD SOON BE DROWNED BUT HE COULD DO NO MORE
YES YES THEY ANSWERED EAGERLY WELL THEN HE CRIED I AM PETER PAN PAN IN A MOMENT HOOK WAS HIMSELF AGAIN AND SMEE AND STARKEY WERE HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN
IT WAS LIKE AN EXAMINATION PAPER THAT ASKS GRAMMAR WHEN WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ASKED IS KINGS OF ENGLAND I DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED UNEASILY BUT I AM QUITE YOUNG
AGAIN WENDY FORGOT HERSELF NEVER SHE CRIED AND BOBBED WHAT WAS THAT BUT THEY COULD SEE NOTHING THEY THOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN A LEAF IN THE WIND DO YOU AGREE MY BULLIES ASKED HOOK THERE IS MY HAND ON IT THEY BOTH SAID
IN TIME THEY COULD NOT EVEN FLY AFTER THEIR HATS WANT OF PRACTICE THEY CALLED IT BUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT WAS THAT THEY NO LONGER BELIEVED MICHAEL BELIEVED LONGER THAN THE OTHER BOYS
AGAIN MISSUS DARLING SCREAMED THIS TIME IN DISTRESS FOR HIM FOR SHE THOUGHT HE WAS KILLED AND SHE RAN DOWN INTO THE STREET TO LOOK FOR HIS LITTLE BODY BUT IT WAS NOT THERE AND SHE LOOKED UP AND IN THE BLACK NIGHT SHE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A SHOOTING STAR
HE ROARED WHILE SHE COMFORTED HER BOYS AND WENDY HUGGED NANA MUCH GOOD HE SAID BITTERLY MY WEARING MYSELF TO THE BONE TRYING TO BE FUNNY IN THIS HOUSE AND STILL WENDY HUGGED NANA
A CODFISH REPLIED THE VOICE ONLY A CODFISH A CODFISH HOOK ECHOED BLANKLY AND IT WAS THEN BUT NOT TILL THEN THAT HIS PROUD SPIRIT BROKE HE SAW HIS MEN DRAW BACK FROM HIM
HE LURED HER OUT OF IT WITH HONEYED WORDS AND SEIZING HER ROUGHLY DRAGGED HER FROM THE NURSERY
THIS IS QUEER SMEE GASPED BETTER DO WHAT THE CAPTAIN ORDERS SAID STARKEY NERVOUSLY AY AY SMEE SAID AND HE CUT TIGER LILY'S CORDS AT ONCE LIKE AN EEL SHE SLID BETWEEN STARKEY'S LEGS INTO THE WATER
PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME EXCUSE FOR HIM HE TOO HAD BEEN DRESSING FOR THE PARTY AND ALL HAD GONE WELL WITH HIM
AS IF FOR A MOMENT HE RECALLED INNOCENT DAYS WHEN BUT HE BRUSHED AWAY THIS WEAKNESS WITH HIS HOOK SMEE MUCH IMPRESSED GAZED AT THE BIRD AS THE NEST WAS BORNE PAST BUT THE MORE SUSPICIOUS STARKEY SAID IF SHE IS A MOTHER
AT ONCE D'YE HEAR CRIED PETER
O PETER NO WONDER YOU WERE CRYING SHE SAID AND GOT OUT OF BED AND RAN TO HIM
THEY HARDLY EVER STAND STILL HE SAID BUT FOR ONE MOMENT WENDY SAW THE ROMANTIC FIGURE COME TO REST ON THE CUCKOO CLOCK O THE LOVELY SHE CRIED THOUGH TINK'S FACE WAS STILL DISTORTED WITH PASSION TINK SAID PETER AMIABLY
OF COURSE IN HIS PRIDE HE WAS CARRYING THE GAME TOO FAR
WE MUST GO SHE SAID ALMOST BRIGHTLY YES HE ANSWERED FAINTLY SHALL WE SWIM OR FLY PETER HE HAD TO TELL HER DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SWIM OR FLY AS FAR AS THE ISLAND WENDY
THEY ARE NOW EMBARKED ON THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN PETER FLEW IN LOOKING FOR HIS SHADOW
THOUGH HER HEART WAS IN HER MOUTH SHE DID NOT WAKEN THEM SHE STOOD OVER THEM TO LET THEM HAVE THEIR SLEEP OUT WAS IT NOT BRAVE OF WENDY IT WAS WELL FOR THOSE BOYS THEN THAT THERE WAS ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD SNIFF DANGER EVEN IN HIS SLEEP PETER
THERE WAS A COMMOTION IN THE FIRMAMENT
AND IT IS ALL MY FAULT STRONG MAN THOUGH HE WAS THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD BEHAVED RATHER FOOLISHLY OVER THE MEDICINE IF HE HAD A WEAKNESS IT WAS FOR THINKING THAT ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD TAKEN MEDICINE BOLDLY AND SO NOW
HERE AND THERE A HEAD BOBBED UP IN THE WATER AND THERE WAS A FLASH OF STEEL FOLLOWED BY A CRY OR A WHOOP IN THE CONFUSION SOME STRUCK AT THEIR OWN SIDE THE CORKSCREW OF SMEE GOT TOOTLES IN THE FOURTH RIB
AND THE SUN WENT AWAY AND SHADOWS STOLE ACROSS THE WATER TURNING IT COLD WENDY COULD NO LONGER SEE TO THREAD HER NEEDLE AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP THE LAGOON THAT HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH A LAUGHING PLACE SEEMED FORMIDABLE AND UNFRIENDLY
IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY YOU ARE WAITING SO AM I WAITING FATHER'S A COWARDLY CUSTARD SO ARE YOU A COWARDLY CUSTARD I'M NOT FRIGHTENED NEITHER AM I FRIGHTENED WELL THEN TAKE IT
NO ONE EVER GETS OVER THE FIRST UNFAIRNESS NO ONE EXCEPT PETER HE OFTEN MET IT BUT HE ALWAYS FORGOT IT I SUPPOSE THAT WAS THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND ALL THE REST SO WHEN HE MET IT NOW IT WAS LIKE THE FIRST TIME
IT HAS COME OFF YES THEN WENDY SAW THE SHADOW ON THE FLOOR
ARE YOU READY BOYS AY AY FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE LAGOON
THE ORDER CAME SHARP AND INCISIVE DIVE THERE WAS A GLEAM OF LEGS AND INSTANTLY THE LAGOON SEEMED DESERTED MAROONERS ROCK STOOD ALONE IN THE FORBIDDING WATERS AS IF IT WERE ITSELF MAROONED THE BOAT DREW NEARER
WHAT IS IT HE CRIED SHRINKING
YOU SEE THAT JUDGE IN A WIG COMING OUT AT THE IRON DOOR THAT USED TO BE TOOTLES THE BEARDED MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY STORY TO TELL HIS CHILDREN
PETER SHE SAID FALTERING ARE YOU EXPECTING ME TO FLY AWAY WITH YOU OF COURSE THAT IS WHY I HAVE COME HE ADDED A LITTLE STERNLY HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT THIS IS SPRING CLEANING TIME
WHAT WAS THE LAST THING PETER EVER SAID TO YOU THE LAST THING HE EVER SAID TO ME WAS JUST ALWAYS BE WAITING FOR ME AND THEN SOME NIGHT YOU WILL HEAR ME CROWING YES BUT ALAS HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT ME
BUT NEXT MOMENT HE HAD SEIZED THE TAIL AND WAS PULLING THE KITE TOWARD HIM IT LIFTED MICHAEL OFF THE GROUND HE CRIED WHY SHOULD IT NOT CARRY YOU BOTH OF US IT CAN'T LIFT TWO MICHAEL AND CURLY TRIED
WHICH CRAVED FOR ADMIRATION WHEN HE HAD TIED HER UP IN THE BACK YARD THE WRETCHED FATHER WENT AND SAT IN THE PASSAGE WITH HIS KNUCKLES TO HIS EYES IN THE MEANTIME MISSUS DARLING HAD PUT THE CHILDREN TO BED IN UNWONTED SILENCE AND LIT THEIR NIGHT LIGHTS
WENDY WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR VERY CLOSE TO THE FIRE SO AS TO SEE TO DARN FOR THERE WAS NO OTHER LIGHT IN THE NURSERY AND WHILE SHE SAT DARNING SHE HEARD A CROW THEN THE WINDOW BLEW OPEN AS OF OLD
WITH THE NECKLACE GEORGE HAD GIVEN HER
AND MISSUS DARLING STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS TO HIM BUT HE REPULSED HER KEEP BACK LADY
IT IS PASSING QUEER SMEE SAID AND THEY ALL FIDGETED UNCOMFORTABLY HOOK RAISED HIS VOICE BUT THERE WAS A QUIVER IN IT SPIRIT THAT HAUNTS THIS DARK LAGOON TO NIGHT HE CRIED DOST HEAR ME
BUT HE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE ASKED HIS CONSENT AS WELL AS HERS
SURELY YOU KNOW WHAT A KISS IS SHE ASKED AGHAST
BUT NO ANSWER CAME SAVE MOCKING LAUGHTER FROM THE MERMAIDS THEY MUST BE SWIMMING BACK OR FLYING THE BOYS CONCLUDED THEY WERE NOT VERY ANXIOUS BECAUSE THEY HAD SUCH FAITH IN PETER THEY CHUCKLED BOYLIKE
SHE WAS MUCH PLEASED AND BOWED BEAUTIFULLY TO HIM FROM THE BED WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
FATHER WENDY CRIED SHOCKED BUT STILL THE CLOUD WAS ON HIM HE KNEW HE WAS BEHAVING UNWORTHILY BUT HE COULD NOT HELP IT WE COULD LIE DOUBLED UP SAID NIBS I ALWAYS CUT THEIR HAIR MYSELF SAID WENDY
WITH A VINDICTIVE POLITENESS THAT WAS QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER MICHAEL FIRST HE SAID DOGGEDLY FATHER FIRST SAID MICHAEL WHO WAS OF A SUSPICIOUS NATURE I SHALL BE SICK YOU KNOW MISTER DARLING SAID THREATENINGLY
GEORGE MISSUS DARLING ENTREATED HIM NOT SO LOUD THE SERVANTS WILL HEAR YOU SOMEHOW THEY HAD GOT INTO THE WAY
O O SHE EXCLAIMED RAPTUROUSLY WENDY WENDY WHEN YOU ARE SLEEPING IN YOUR SILLY BED YOU MIGHT BE FLYING ABOUT WITH ME SAYING FUNNY THINGS TO THE STARS O O AND WENDY THERE ARE MERMAIDS MERMAIDS WITH TAILS SUCH LONG TAILS OH CRIED WENDY TO SEE A MERMAID
FOR THE CROCODILE WAS IN DOGGED PURSUIT OF HIM ON ORDINARY OCCASIONS THE BOYS WOULD HAVE SWUM ALONGSIDE CHEERING BUT NOW THEY WERE UNEASY FOR THEY HAD LOST BOTH PETER AND WENDY AND WERE SCOURING THE LAGOON FOR THEM CALLING THEM BY NAME THEY FOUND THE DINGHY AND WENT HOME IN IT SHOUTING
THE BOYS PLAYED ROUGH JOKES AND THOUGHT IT SMART TO BE CLUMSY AND TO RUN INTO EACH OTHER ON THE FLOOR FOR THE SQUARE DANCES THERE WAS ALWAYS THE BAWLING VOICE OF THE CALLER WHO WAS ALSO THE COUNTY AUCTIONEER
THEA WAS TELLING RAY ABOUT THIS UNPLEASANT ENCOUNTER AS THEY WERE DRIVING OUT TO THE SAND HILLS THE NEXT SUNDAY SHE WAS STUFFING YOU ALL RIGHT THEE RAY REASSURED HER
SHE LAY STILL UNTIL SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER THEN SHE WAKENED FRITZ AND THEY WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW AND LEANED OUT THEY COULD HEAR CLEARLY THERE
COME FROM TORREON THEY GOING TO SALT LAKE FOR SOME JOB A AND STAY OFF WITH HIM TWO THREE DAYS AND HE MUS HAVE A PARTY YOU LIKE TO COME THAT WAS HOW THEA CAME TO GO TO THE MEXICAN BALL
SOME OF THEM THEA HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN OUT OF THEIR WORKING CLOTHES SMEARED WITH GREASE FROM THE ROUND HOUSE OR CLAY FROM THE BRICKYARD SOMETIMES WHEN THE MUSIC HAPPENED TO BE A POPULAR MEXICAN WALTZ SONG
YOU COULD FIX IT UP SO PRETTY I DIDN'T WANT IT HONEST I DIDN'T FATHER WOULD HAVE LET ME HAVE IT I LIKE MY OWN ROOM BETTER SOMEHOW I CAN THINK BETTER IN A LITTLE ROOM
THEY WERE LISTENING TO A MEXICAN PART SONG THE TENOR THEN THE SOPRANO THEN BOTH TOGETHER THE BARYTONE JOINS THEM RAGES IS EXTINGUISHED THE TENOR EXPIRES IN SOBS
OH SHE WOULD MAKE THESE PEOPLE SORRY ENOUGH THERE WOULD COME A TIME WHEN THEY WOULD WANT TO MAKE IT UP WITH HER BUT NEVER AGAIN SHE HAD NO LITTLE VANITIES
WE HAVE NO ALTO BUT ALL THE GIRLS CAN SING ALTO AND MAKE SOME NOISE THE WOMEN LAUGHED MEXICAN WOMEN OF THE POORER CLASS DO NOT SING LIKE THE MEN PERHAPS THEY ARE TOO INDOLENT
HE HAD NEVER EMBARRASSED HER BY SO MUCH AS A GLANCE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY DROVE OUT TO THE SAND HILLS HE LET HIS LEFT ARM LIE ALONG THE BACK OF THE BUGGY SEAT BUT IT NEVER CAME ANY NEARER TO THEA THAN THAT NEVER TOUCHED HER
TO BELIEVE THAT THOUGH THEY HAD NO PARTICULAR ENDOWMENTS THEY WERE OF HER KIND AND NOT OF THE MOONSTONE KIND NOW THEY HAD ALL GROWN UP AND BECOME PERSONS
JOHNNY APPROACHED THEA HIS GUITAR UNDER HIS ARM AND THE ELDER RAMAS BOY POLITELY GAVE UP HIS PLACE JOHNNY SAT DOWN TOOK A LONG BREATH STRUCK A FIERCE CHORD AND THEN HUSHED IT WITH HIS OTHER HAND
MISTER KRONBORG AT ONE END OF THE LONG TABLE MISSUS KRONBORG AT THE OTHER ANNA STIFF AND CEREMONIOUS IN HER SUMMER SILK SAT AT HER FATHER'S RIGHT
BESIDES UP THERE I AM AWAY FROM EVERYBODY AND I CAN READ AS LATE AS I PLEASE AND NOBODY NAGS ME A GROWING GIRL NEEDS LOTS OF SLEEP RAY PROVIDENTLY REMARKED
BY THIS TIME SHE WAS AS WHITE AS THE SUNDAY TABLECLOTH WELL SHE REPLIED IN A COLD EVEN TONE I'LL HAVE TO THROW IT AT THEM SOONER OR LATER IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHEN
I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD SHOW MORE CONSIDERATION FOR FATHER'S POSITION THEA ANNA BEGAN AS SOON AS SHE AND HER SISTER WERE ALONE THEA GAVE HER A SIDELONG GLANCE WHY WHAT HAVE I DONE TO FATHER
ONCE WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE LADS THEIR MOTHER TOOK THEM ALONG WHEN SHE WENT TO HELP THE WOMEN DECORATE THE CHURCH FOR EASTER SOME ONE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE HAD BROUGHT ANY FLOWERS AND SHE REPLIED THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT HER RAMAS
SHE ADDED THAT THEA'S BAD MANNERS WITH THE OLDER GIRLS WERE BEING TALKED ABOUT ALL OVER TOWN AND THAT IF HER TEMPER DID NOT SPEEDILY IMPROVE SHE WOULD LOSE ALL HER ADVANCED PUPILS
AND THEA HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE NEW HALL BECAUSE EVERY OTHER HOUSE IN THE TOWN WAS DESERTED EVEN THE BABIES HAD GONE TO THE BALL A NEIGHBOR WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO HOLD THE BABY WHILE THE MOTHER DANCED
I TALKED TO THE PIANO TUNER THE LAST TIME HE WAS HERE AND HE SAID ALL THE PEOPLE HE TUNED FOR EXPRESSED THEMSELVES VERY FAVORABLY ABOUT YOUR TEACHING I WISH YOU DIDN'T TAKE SO MUCH PAINS WITH THEM MYSELF
SHE HAD SUNG FOR CHURCHES AND FUNERALS AND TEACHERS BUT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE SUNG FOR A REALLY MUSICAL PEOPLE AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD EVER FELT THE RESPONSE THAT SUCH A PEOPLE CAN GIVE
EVERYBODY AT SUNDAY SCHOOL WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU GOING OVER THERE AND SINGING WITH THE MEXICANS ALL NIGHT WHEN YOU WON'T SING FOR THE CHURCH SOMEBODY HEARD YOU AND TOLD IT ALL OVER TOWN
EXCEPT THAT IT WAS A LITTLE LONGER AND WAS SO UNPRETENTIOUS THAT NOBODY IN MOONSTONE KNEW OF ITS EXISTENCE THE SPANISH BOYS ARE RETICENT ABOUT THEIR OWN AFFAIRS
SHE FOUND LATER THAT IT WAS THE PROPERTY OF ONE OF RAMAS'S YOUNG COUSINS WHO WAS TAKING IT TO UTAH WITH HIM TO CHEER HIM AT HIS JOB A THE MEXICANS NEVER WAIT UNTIL IT IS DARK TO BEGIN TO DANCE
SILVO DROPPED ON HIS BACK AND LAY LOOKING AT THE MOON UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS STILL LOOKING AT THEA WHEN SHE FINISHED THE FIRST VERSE THEA WHISPERED TO JOHNNY AGAIN I CAN DO IT BETTER THAN THAT
THEIR AMBITIONS AND SACRED PROPRIETIES WERE MEANINGLESS TO HER SHE HAD NEGLECTED TO CONGRATULATE CHARLEY UPON HAVING BEEN PROMOTED FROM THE GROCERY DEPARTMENT OF COMMINGS'S STORE TO THE DRYGOODS DEPARTMENT
AND IT MIGHT AS WELL BE NOW AS ANY TIME SHE CARRIED THE TRAY BLINDLY INTO THE KITCHEN TILLIE WHO WAS ALWAYS LISTENING AND LOOKING OUT FOR HER TOOK THE DISHES FROM HER WITH A FURTIVE FRIGHTENED GLANCE AT HER STONY FACE
OR HAVE SUCH DREAMS IN ANY OTHER BED EVEN LAST NIGHT SUCH SWEET BREATHLESS DREAMS THEA HID HER FACE IN THE PILLOW WHEREVER SHE WENT SHE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT LITTLE BED WITH HER
THEA WENT SLOWLY UP THE BACK STAIRS TO HER LOFT HER LEGS SEEMED AS HEAVY AS LEAD AS SHE CLIMBED THE STAIRS AND SHE FELT AS IF EVERYTHING INSIDE HER HAD SOLIDIFIED AND GROWN HARD
SHE COULD GO TO SPANISH JOHNNY'S AND SING PART SONGS WITH THE MEXICANS AND NOBODY OBJECTED THEA WAS STILL UNDER THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF TEACHING AND WAS TERRIBLY IN EARNEST ABOUT IT
SHE HERSELF WOULD DECIDE WHAT PIECES GRACE SHOULD STUDY THEA READILY CONSENTED TO THAT AND MISSUS JOHNSON RUSTLED AWAY TO TELL A NEIGHBOR WOMAN THAT THEA KRONBORG COULD BE MEEK ENOUGH WHEN YOU WENT AT HER RIGHT
YOU GET LOST IN THE CORN NOT EVEN A SALOON TO KEEP THINGS GOING SELL WHISKEY WITHOUT A LICENSE AT THE BUTCHER SHOP BEER ON ICE WITH THE LIVER AND BEEFSTEAK
THERE'S NO GENERAL DISSATISFACTION AMONG YOUR SCHOLARS SHE JUST WANTED TO GET IN A KNOCK
SHE FELT ALL THOSE DARK EYES FIX THEMSELVES UPON HER INTENTLY SHE COULD SEE THEM SHINE THE FACES CAME OUT OF THE SHADOW LIKE THE WHITE FLOWERS OVER THE DOOR
THERE WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF EASE AND FRIENDLY PLEASURE IN THE LOW DIMLY LIT ROOM AND THEA COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHETHER THE MEXICANS HAD NO JEALOUSIES OR NEIGHBORLY GRUDGES AS THE PEOPLE IN MOONSTONE HAD
THE OTHERS MIGHT BE ANYBODY OVER THERE JUST MEXICAN VOICES THEN AT THE APPOINTED AT THE ACUTE MOMENT THE SOPRANO VOICE LIKE A FOUNTAIN JET
FROM DENVER AND KEPT HIS EYES AND EARS OPEN FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT INTEREST HER HE WAS OF COURSE LIVING FOR THEA HE HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT CAREFULLY AND HAD MADE UP HIS MIND
THEY'LL ALWAYS GO FOR ME JUST AS THEY DID FOR WUNSCH IT WASN'T BECAUSE HE DRANK THEY WENT FOR HIM NOT REALLY IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE
AND WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TRAIN THEIR VISION UPON DISTANT OBJECTS RAY REALIZED THAT THEA'S LIFE WAS DULL AND EXACTING AND THAT SHE MISSED WUNSCH HE KNEW SHE WORKED HARD
THEA MOVED RESTLESSLY ON THE BUGGY CUSHIONS THEY NEED OTHER THINGS MORE SHE MUTTERED OH I FORGOT I BROUGHT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU LOOK HERE IT CAME ON MY BIRTHDAY
WE MUST STOP ON OUR WAY BACK AND SHOW THIS CARD TO MISSUS KOHLER SHE MISSES HIM SO BY THE WAY THEE
UNINQUIRING HE RESTED THEA BECAUSE HE WAS SO DIFFERENT BECAUSE THOUGH HE OFTEN TOLD HER INTERESTING THINGS HE NEVER SET LIVELY FANCIES GOING IN HER HEAD BECAUSE HE NEVER MISUNDERSTOOD HER
AND FELICITY WAS ENOUGH SHE TOOK THE LETTERS AS HE GAVE THEM THE FIRST WAS FROM THE ADMIRAL TO INFORM HIS NEPHEW IN A FEW WORDS OF HIS HAVING SUCCEEDED IN THE OBJECT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN
EDMUND TRUE I BELIEVE HE IS GENERALLY SPEAKING KIND TO HER AND SO IS SIR THOMAS IN HIS WAY BUT IT IS THE WAY OF A RICH SUPERIOR LONG WORDED ARBITRARY UNCLE
WHAT WAS INSPIRED BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER BEING WELL PRINCIPLED AND RELIGIOUS I COULD SO WHOLLY AND ABSOLUTELY CONFIDE IN HER SAID HE
AS IF NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS I COULD NOT GET AWAY SOONER FANNY LOOKED SO LOVELY I AM QUITE DETERMINED MARY MY MIND IS ENTIRELY MADE UP WILL IT ASTONISH YOU NO YOU MUST BE AWARE
IF MISTER RUSHWORTH WERE A SON OF YOUR OWN HE COULD NOT HOLD SIR THOMAS IN GREATER RESPECT SIR THOMAS GAVE UP THE POINT FOILED BY HER EVASIONS DISARMED BY HER FLATTERY AND WAS OBLIGED TO REST SATISFIED WITH THE CONVICTION
MISSUS NORRIS OFTEN TALKS OF HER LUCK WHAT WILL SHE SAY NOW THE DELIGHT OF ALL THE FAMILY INDEED AND SHE HAS SOME TRUE FRIENDS IN IT HOW THEY WILL REJOICE
AS I WISH AND DESIRE IT YOU WILL HAVE A SWEET LITTLE WIFE ALL GRATITUDE AND DEVOTION EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESERVE WHAT AN AMAZING MATCH FOR HER
AND WHILE THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION
AND FOUND HERSELF EXPECTED TO BELIEVE THAT SHE HAD CREATED SENSATIONS WHICH HIS HEART HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE AND THAT EVERYTHING HE HAD DONE FOR WILLIAM WAS TO BE PLACED TO THE ACCOUNT OF HIS EXCESSIVE
THE REPROOF OF AN IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION OF EVERYTHING THE SWEEP OF EVERY PREPARATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENT THERE WAS ONE PERSON HOWEVER IN THE HOUSE WHOM HE COULD NOT LEAVE TO LEARN HIS SENTIMENTS MERELY THROUGH HIS CONDUCT
INFINITELY OBLIGED ABSOLUTELY ANGRY IT WAS ALL BEYOND BELIEF HE WAS INEXCUSABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT SUCH WERE HIS HABITS THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT A MIXTURE OF EVIL
WAS SO ABOUNDING IN THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN TWOFOLD MOTIVES IN VIEWS AND WISHES MORE THAN COULD BE TOLD THAT FANNY COULD NOT HAVE REMAINED INSENSIBLE OF HIS DRIFT HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND
AND AT AN EARLIER HOUR THAN COMMON VISITING WARRANTS THE TWO LADIES WERE TOGETHER IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND FORTUNATELY FOR HIM LADY BERTRAM WAS ON THE VERY POINT OF QUITTING IT AS HE ENTERED SHE WAS ALMOST AT THE DOOR
AND TOM HAD TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING WITH PROPER APOLOGIES FOR HIS FATHER'S PARTICULARITY WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED MISTER YATES FELT IT AS ACUTELY AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED
AND REGULARITY OF CONDUCT SUCH A HIGH NOTION OF HONOUR AND SUCH AN OBSERVANCE OF DECORUM AS MIGHT WARRANT ANY MAN IN THE FULLEST DEPENDENCE ON HER FAITH AND INTEGRITY HE EXPRESSED
YOUR LADY AND I SHALL BE VERY SAFE YOU KNOW HOW STEADY STEPHEN IS AND CHARLES HAS BEEN UPON THE LEADERS SO OFTEN NOW THAT I AM SURE THERE IS NO FEAR BUT HOWEVER I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO HE WAS BENT UPON GOING
HER TEMPER HE HAD GOOD REASON TO DEPEND ON AND TO PRAISE HE HAD OFTEN SEEN IT TRIED WAS THERE ONE OF THE FAMILY EXCEPTING EDMUND WHO HAD NOT IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
YOUR KINDNESS TO WILLIAM MAKES ME MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN WORDS CAN EXPRESS BUT I DO NOT WANT I CANNOT BEAR
AS TO GENERAL ATTENTION TO THE INTEREST AND COMFORT OF HIS FAMILY MUCH EXERTION AND MANY SACRIFICES TO GLANCE AT IN THE FORM OF HURRIED WALKS AND SUDDEN REMOVALS FROM HER OWN FIRESIDE AND MANY EXCELLENT HINTS OF DISTRUST AND ECONOMY
BUT GO ON GO ON TELL ME MORE WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS DOES SHE KNOW HER OWN HAPPINESS NO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR
BY BEGINNING AT AN EARLIER STAGE AND EXPLAINING VERY PARTICULARLY WHAT HE HAD DONE HIS LAST JOURNEY TO LONDON HAD BEEN UNDERTAKEN WITH NO OTHER VIEW THAN THAT OF INTRODUCING HER BROTHER IN HILL STREET
SHOULD BE PROVED THE PRAISE OF A FRIEND AS THIS DAY DOES PROVE IT NOW I MAY SAY THAT EVEN I COULD NOT REQUIRE WILLIAM PRICE TO EXCITE A GREATER INTEREST OR BE FOLLOWED BY WARMER WISHES AND HIGHER COMMENDATION
AS IF IT WERE THE BEST BLESSING OF LIFE YOU ARE NOT SENSIBLE OF THE GAIN FOR YOUR REGARD FOR HIM HAS BLINDED YOU BUT IN MY ESTIMATION YOUR MARRYING EARLY MAY BE THE SAVING OF YOU
THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF NOT DOING EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO MAKE FANNY PRICE HAPPY OR OF CEASING TO LOVE FANNY PRICE WAS OF COURSE THE GROUNDWORK OF HIS ELOQUENT ANSWER
BUT HER HEART WAS SO FULL AND HER SENSES STILL SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE COULD LISTEN BUT IMPERFECTLY EVEN TO WHAT HE TOLD HER OF WILLIAM AND SAYING ONLY WHEN HE PAUSED HOW KIND
WHILE HER HAND WAS TREMBLING UNDER THESE LETTERS HER EYE RUNNING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND HER HEART SWELLING WITH EMOTION CRAWFORD THUS CONTINUED WITH UNFEIGNED EAGERNESS TO EXPRESS HIS INTEREST IN THE EVENT
SO MUCH AS IF IT WERE A MATTER OF COURSE THAT SHE WAS NOT TO HAVE A MOMENT AT HER OWN COMMAND HER HAIR ARRANGED AS NEATLY AS IT ALWAYS IS AND ONE LITTLE CURL FALLING FORWARD AS SHE WROTE WHICH SHE NOW AND THEN SHOOK BACK
SHE HAD NOTHING FARTHER TO TRY HER OWN HIS STILL REFUSING TO TELL HER WHAT HE HAD GONE FOR WAS BUT THE PROMOTION OF GAIETY A DAY BEFORE IT MIGHT HAVE IRRITATED
OF THE SAME SMALL PARTY IN THE SAME BAD WEATHER HAD THEY BEEN PUT TO THE PROOF BUT AS THAT VERY EVENING BROUGHT HER BROTHER DOWN FROM LONDON AGAIN IN QUITE OR MORE THAN QUITE HIS USUAL CHEERFULNESS
AND SO ENDED ALL THE HOPES HIS SELFISH VANITY HAD RAISED IN MARIA AND JULIA BERTRAM JULIA COULD REJOICE THAT HE WAS GONE HIS PRESENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BE ODIOUS TO HER AND IF MARIA GAINED HIM NOT
HENRY OVERJOYED TO HAVE HER GO BOWED AND WATCHED HER OFF AND WITHOUT LOSING ANOTHER MOMENT TURNED INSTANTLY TO FANNY AND TAKING OUT SOME LETTERS SAID
WAS IN HAVING FORMED THE CONNEXION WITH THE RUSHWORTHS THERE SHE WAS IMPREGNABLE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE CREDIT OF BRINGING MISTER RUSHWORTH'S ADMIRATION OF MARIA TO ANY EFFECT IF I HAD NOT BEEN ACTIVE SAID SHE
THOUGH TO PART WITH HER AT A MOMENT WHEN HER MODESTY ALONE SEEMED TO HIS SANGUINE AND PREASSURED MIND TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE HAPPINESS HE SOUGHT WAS A CRUEL NECESSITY
FANNY COULD NOT SPEAK BUT HE DID NOT WANT HER TO SPEAK TO SEE THE EXPRESSION OF HER EYES THE CHANGE OF HER COMPLEXION THE PROGRESS OF HER FEELINGS THEIR DOUBT CONFUSION
WELL WELL I AM SATISFIED I KNOW NOW TO WHOM IT MUST RELATE AND AM IN NO HURRY FOR THE REST FANNY PRICE WONDERFUL QUITE WONDERFUL
MARY WAS IN A STATE OF MIND TO REJOICE IN A CONNEXION WITH THE BERTRAM FAMILY AND TO BE NOT DISPLEASED WITH HER BROTHER'S MARRYING A LITTLE BENEATH HIM YES MARY WAS HENRY'S CONCLUDING ASSURANCE
I DID INDEED IT MIGHT NOT BE SAVING THEM MUCH BUT IT WAS SOMETHING AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO SIT AT MY EASE AND BE DRAGGED UP AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE NOBLE ANIMALS I CAUGHT A DREADFUL COLD BUT THAT I DID NOT REGARD MY OBJECT WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE VISIT
AND NOT CHUSING BY ANY MEANS TO TAKE SO MUCH TROUBLE IN VAIN SHE STILL WENT ON AFTER A CIVIL RECEPTION A SHORT SENTENCE ABOUT BEING WAITED FOR AND A LET SIR THOMAS KNOW TO THE SERVANT
IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER AND THE ROADS ALMOST IMPASSABLE BUT I DID PERSUADE HER I KNOW HOW GREAT HOW JUSTLY GREAT YOUR INFLUENCE IS WITH LADY BERTRAM AND HER CHILDREN
BUT MY HEART QUITE ACHED FOR HIM AT EVERY JOLT AND WHEN WE GOT INTO THE ROUGH LANES ABOUT STOKE WHERE WHAT WITH FROST AND SNOW UPON BEDS OF STONES IT WAS WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE I WAS QUITE IN AN AGONY ABOUT HIM
HE WAS GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY BEING TO MEET HIS UNCLE AT BATH WITHOUT DELAY BUT IF THERE WERE ANY PROSPECT OF A RENEWAL OF LOVERS VOWS HE SHOULD HOLD HIMSELF POSITIVELY ENGAGED HE SHOULD BREAK THROUGH EVERY OTHER CLAIM
I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS THINK THE ACQUAINTANCE WORTH ANY TROUBLE THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN TO ESTABLISH IT THERE IS NOTHING VERY STRIKING IN MISTER RUSHWORTH'S MANNERS BUT I WAS PLEASED LAST NIGHT WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE HIS OPINION ON ONE SUBJECT
BESIDES THERE ARE THE CHRYSANTHEMUMS JUST COMING INTO FLOWER HOW DID IT GET INTO THE GARDEN ASKED ESHLEY I IMAGINE IT CAME IN BY THE GATE SAID THE LADY IMPATIENTLY
WHO DIVIDED HIS TIME BETWEEN AMATEUR HORSE DEALING RABBIT SHOOTING AND FLIRTING WITH THE FARM MAIDS IM AFRAID OLD MARTHA IS DYING SAID EMMA JIM WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON TO WHOM ONE HAD TO BREAK NEWS GENTLY NONSENSE
GOOD GRACIOUS HAVE ANY LIVES BEEN LOST HEAPS I SHOULD SAY
ONE OF THEM I BELIEVE IS STILL LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE TIGRIS VALLEY
THERE WAS AN UNSPOKEN WISH IN THOSE WORDS A WISH WHICH WAS UNCONFESSED AS WELL AS UNSPOKEN EMMA LADBRUK WAS THE MISTRESS OF THE FARM JOINTLY WITH HER HUSBAND SHE MIGHT HAVE HER SAY AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HER WAY IN ORDERING ITS AFFAIRS
WHEN HE SAID NINEPENCE I GAVE HIM THEIR ADDRESS JABBED OUR CARD IN PAID TENPENCE OR ELEVENPENCE TO COVER THE POSTAGE AND THANKED HEAVEN WITH LESS SINCERITY AND INFINITELY MORE TROUBLE THEY EVENTUALLY THANKED ME THE FROPLINSONS DONT PLAY BRIDGE SAID EGBERT
A WORDSWORTH BOOKLET NEXT CHRISTMAS AND ANOTHER CALENDAR THE CHRISTMAS AFTER WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OF HAVING TO WRITE SUITABLE LETTERS OF THANKFULNESS NO THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO DROP ALL FURTHER ALLUSION TO THE CALENDAR AND SWITCH OFF ON TO SOME OTHER TOPIC BUT WHAT OTHER TOPIC
I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO THINK OF YOU AS A DELIBERATE LIAR HE OBSERVED COLDLY BUT ONE OCCASIONALLY HAS TO DO THINGS ONE DOES NOT LIKE AT ANY RATE
ON WHOSE FRONT PAGE WAS THE RECORD IN FADED INK OF A BAPTISM DATED NINETY FOUR YEARS AGO MARTHA CRALE WAS THE NAME WRITTEN ON THAT YELLOW PAGE THE YELLOW WRINKLED OLD DAME WHO HOBBLED AND MUTTERED ABOUT THE KITCHEN
I HAVE ONLY THE SAME CONVENTIONAL LANGUAGE OF GRATITUDE AT MY DISPOSAL WITH WHICH TO THANK DEAR OLD COLONEL CHUTTLE FOR HIS PERFECTLY DELICIOUS STILTON WHICH WE SHALL DEVOUR TO THE LAST MORSEL AND THE FROPLINSONS FOR THEIR CALENDAR WHICH WE SHALL NEVER LOOK AT
HE OBSERVED IS THE SUDDEN IMPULSE TO TREK AND MIGRATE THAT BREAKS OUT NOW AND AGAIN FOR NO APPARENT REASON IN COMMUNITIES OF HITHERTO STAY AT HOME ANIMALS IN HUMAN AFFAIRS THE SAME PHENOMENON IS OCCASIONALLY NOTICEABLE SAID SIR LULWORTH
OVERWORKED OFFICE BOY WHO WAS THE ONE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE EDITORIAL BRAIN AND THE BUSINESS DEPARTMENTS OF THE PAPER SARDONICALLY EXPLAINED THE NEW ALOOFNESS AS THE YARKAND MANNER MOST OF THE REPORTERS
A LIGHT DRIZZLING RAIN WAS FALLING BUT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF ANY INUNDATION SOME HALF HOUR LATER HE MET VERA ON THE WAY TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM
THE NAMES CHANGED BUT IT WAS ALWAYS LIBRULS AND TOORIES YELLOWS AND BLUES AND THEY ALWAYS QUARRELLED AND SHOUTED AS TO WHO WAS RIGHT AND WHO WAS WRONG THE ONE THEY QUARRELLED ABOUT MOST WAS A FINE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH AN ANGRY FACESHE
SHE COULD SEE AN ANGLE OF THE LONG LATTICED WINDOW THAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN COSY WITH CURTAINS AND GAY WITH BOWLS OF FLOWERS INTO HER MIND CAME THE THOUGHT THAT FOR MONTHS PERHAPS FOR YEARS LONG AFTER SHE HAD BEEN UTTERLY FORGOTTEN
A GRIN SPREAD OVER HIS GOOD NATURED FEATURES IT DONT LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID NODDING TOWARDS THE YARD EMMA TURNED TO CATCH THE MEANING OF HIS REMARK OLD MARTHA STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF A MOB OF POULTRY
RESUMED ITS MASSAGE OPERATIONS WITH RENEWED ZEAL DURING THE LONG WAKEFUL HOURS WHICH ENSUED LATIMER TRIED TO DISTRACT HIS MIND FROM HIS OWN IMMEDIATE TROUBLES BY DWELLING WITH DECENT SYMPATHY ON THE SECOND HOUSEMAIDS BEREAVEMENT
IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED LIKE A WITHERED STALK STANDING AMID A RIOTOUS GROWTH OF GAILY HUED FLOWERS BUT SHE THREW THE GRAIN DEFTLY AMID THE WILDERNESS OF BEAKS
WHAT TROUBLE DID THEY TAKE TO FIND OUT WHETHER WE READ WORDSWORTH WITH GLADNESS FOR ALL THEY KNEW OR CARED WE MIGHT BE FRANTICALLY EMBEDDED IN THE BELIEF THAT ALL POETRY BEGINS AND ENDS WITH JOHN MASEFIELD AND IT MIGHT INFURIATE OR DEPRESS US TO HAVE A DAILY SAMPLE OF WORDSWORTHIAN PRODUCTS FLUNG AT US
WHAT IS MORE THE COLONEL KNOWS THAT EVEN IF WE HAD TAKEN A SUDDEN AVERSION TO STILTON OR BEEN FORBIDDEN IT BY THE DOCTOR WE SHOULD STILL HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER OF HEARTY THANKS AROUND IT SO YOU SEE THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT
LATIMER SPRINGFIELD WAS A RATHER CHEERLESS OLDISH YOUNG MAN WHO WENT INTO POLITICS SOMEWHAT IN THE SPIRIT IN WHICH OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT GO INTO HALF MOURNING
EVERY CARE OF HARTLEPOOLS WONDER WONT YOU SAID VERA HIS MOTHER TOOK THREE FIRSTS AT BIRMINGHAM

THERE HAD BEEN A PALMERSTON THAT HAD BEEN A NAME DOWN TIVERTON WAY TIVERTON WAS NOT A FAR JOURNEY AS THE CROW FLIES BUT TO MARTHA IT WAS ALMOST A FOREIGN COUNTRY LATER THERE HAD BEEN NORTHCOTES AND ACLANDS AND MANY OTHER NEWER NAMES THAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN
WITH A QUOTATION OF ONE OF HIS GREAT THOUGHTS FOR EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR IMPOSSIBLE SAID EGBERT HE DIDNT HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUGHTS IN THE WHOLE OF HIS LIFE OR IF HE DID HE KEPT THEM TO HIMSELF HE WAS A MAN OF ACTION NOT OF INTROSPECTION
I HADNT THOUGHT OF THAT BUT
FOUND IT AS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INTO DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE EDITOR AND HIS SATELLITES NOW THAT THEY HAD RETURNED AS WHEN THEY HAD BEEN EXCUSABLY INACCESSIBLE IN CENTRAL ASIA THE SULKY
SHE HAD SEEN IT ON THE FLOOR TOO WITH A ROTTEN APPLE SQUASHED OVER IT FOR THE FARM HAD CHANGED ITS POLITICS FROM TIME TO TIME MARTHA HAD NEVER BEEN ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER NONE OF THEY HAD EVER DONE THE FARM A STROKE OF GOOD

HE MAKES HAMLET SAY REST REST PERTURBED SPIRIT AND THAT I SUPPOSE MEANS AN EASY CHAIR AN AMERICAN ROCKING CHAIR I THINK FAYFIELD JUNCTION MY LADY CHANGE FOR ELVESTON THE GUARD ANNOUNCED FLINGING OPEN THE DOOR OF THE CARRIAGE
AND THIS NEW OFFER I ADMIT IS VERY VERY KINDLY MEANT STILL TO AVAIL MYSELF OF IT WOULD NOT BE QUITE CONVENIENT YOU'LL SEE IN A MOMENT WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN CONVENIENT AND INCONVENIENT
AS I WAS SAYING THE OTHER PROFESSOR RESUMED IF YOU'LL JUST THINK OVER ANY POEM THAT CONTAINS THE WORDS SUCH AS PETER IS POOR SAID NOBLE PAUL AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HIS FRIEND AND THOUGH MY MEANS TO GIVE ARE SMALL AT LEAST I CAN AFFORD TO LEND
AND THEN ITS EYES LOOKED UNHAPPY NOT BOTH ITS EYES SYLVIE INTERRUPTED COURSE NOT SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW
WITH A NOT UNPLEASANT THRILL LIKE WHAT A GOOD GHOST STORY GIVES ONE AT THE UNCANNY COINCIDENCE OF MY HAVING SO UNEXPECTEDLY DIVINED THE SUBJECT OF HER STUDIES IT WAS A BOOK OF DOMESTIC COOKERY OPEN AT THE ARTICLE BREAD SAUCE
THE PROFESSOR LEFT HIS DISTINGUISHED PUPIL STANDING AT THE DOOR AND MEEKLY RETURNED THERE IS A RUMOUR AFLOAT THAT THE PEOPLE WISH TO ELECT AN
THEY COULDN'T WELTER IN GORE TO SAVE THEIR LIVES WELTERING IN GORE IS A VERY EXPRESSIVE PHRASE CERTAINLY CAN IT BE DONE IN ANY FLUID I WONDER
PAUL BUSTLED IN TO HAVE A CHAT AND GRASPED HIS HAND WITH FRIENDLY ZEAL I KNEW SAID HE YOUR FRUGAL WAYS SO THAT I MIGHT NOT WOUND YOUR PRIDE BY BRINGING STRANGERS IN TO GAZE I'VE LEFT MY LEGAL FRIEND OUTSIDE
AND IT WAS ONLY AFTER THEY HAD GIVEN ME FULL DETAILS OF A PROJECTED PICNIC TO WHICH THEY INVITED ME THAT LADY MURIEL EXCLAIMED ALMOST AS AN AFTER THOUGHT
BUT THE BOOKLETS THE LITTLE THRILLING ROMANCES WHERE THE MURDER COMES AT PAGE FIFTEEN AND THE WEDDING AT PAGE FORTY SURELY THEY ARE DUE TO STEAM AND WHEN WE TRAVEL BY ELECTRICITY IF I MAY VENTURE TO DEVELOP YOUR THEORY WE SHALL HAVE LEAFLETS INSTEAD OF BOOKLETS
THE LION MADE A PROFOUND OBEISANCE SYLVIE AND BRUNO AT THE SAME MOMENT DISMOUNTING AND LEAPING IN TO THE ARMS OF THEIR FATHER
BUT THERE'S A HEART WITHIN THIS BREAST AND I WILL LEND YOU FIFTY MORE NOT SO WAS PETER'S MILD REPLY HIS CHEEKS ALL WET WITH GRATEFUL TEARS NO MAN RECALLS SO WELL AS I YOUR SERVICES IN BYGONE YEARS
AND IS FIVE O'CLOCK TEA TO BE GOING ON ALL THE WHILE SAID LADY MURIEL THAT AND OTHER THINGS SAID ARTHUR THE INHABITANTS WOULD LIVE THEIR LIVES GROW UP AND DIE
YOU HAVE A REAL GOOD TERRIFYING GHOST IN THAT BOOK I HINTED HOW COULD YOU GUESS SHE EXCLAIMED WITH THE MOST ENGAGING FRANKNESS AND PLACED THE VOLUME IN MY HANDS I OPENED IT EAGERLY
INSTANTLY I STEPPED OUT INTO THE STREET PICKED UP THE BOX AND REPLACED IT IN THE CART IN THE NEXT MOMENT THE BICYCLE HAD SPUN ROUND THE CORNER PASSED THE CART WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE AND SOON VANISHED IN THE DISTANCE IN A CLOUD OF DUST
AND HE BEGAN TROTTING ROUND AND ROUND THE ROOM LIFTING UP THE CHAIRS AND SHAKING THEM BRUNO TOOK A VERY SMALL BOOK OUT OF THE BOOKCASE OPENED IT AND SHOOK IT IN IMITATION OF THE PROFESSOR HE ISN'T HERE HE SAID
I COULD BUT RUB MY EYES AND SAY WHERE THEN ARE THE RAGS GONE TO FOR THE OLD MAN WAS NOW DRESSED IN ROYAL ROBES THAT GLITTERED WITH JEWELS AND GOLD EMBROIDERY
AFTER WHICH I WAS NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THE CHILDREN SKIPPING BACKWARDS AFTER HER EXCLAIMING OH MOTHER IT IS SUCH A LOVELY DAY FOR A WALK IN THE DINING ROOM THE TABLE HAD ONLY DIRTY PLATES AND EMPTY DISHES ON IT
AND IF ANY ONE KNOWS US THEY'LL HAVE SHARP EYES THAT'S ALL
WITH A LARGE EXTINGUISHER OVER IT THE PROFESSOR MILDLY EXPLAINED THAT HIS HIGHNESS HAD BEEN GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO SAY HE WOULDN'T DO HIS LESSONS
THE VICE WARDEN MIGHT HEAR YOU HE'S GETTING AWFULLY STRICT
SHE HAD GOT ONE OF THE CUPBOARDS OPEN AND STOOD WITH HER BACK TO HIM SMOOTHING DOWN A SHEET OF BROWN PAPER ON ONE OF THE SHELVES AND WHISPERING TO HERSELF SO SO DEFTLY DONE
WHO WAS STANDING ON ONE LEG AS USUAL AND BUSILY EMPLOYED IN WATERING A BED OF FLOWERS WITH AN EMPTY WATERING CAN IT HASN'T GOT NO WATER IN IT BRUNO EXPLAINED TO HIM PULLING HIS SLEEVE TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION IT'S LIGHTER TO HOLD SAID THE GARDENER
I WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT I FREELY CONFESS IF I HAD NOT SEEN IT WITH MY OWN EYES THEN WHY SHOULD I EXPECT IT OF MY READER WHO QUITE POSSIBLY HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OF THE SORT
LIKE THAT AND THEY COME OUT OH EVER SO LONG ONCE BRUNO BEGAN AGAIN SYLVIE AND ME WRITED
THE LION AT ONCE BROKE INTO AN EASY CANTER AND WE SOON FOUND OURSELVES IN THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST I SAY WE FOR I AM CERTAIN THAT I ACCOMPANIED THEM
A LOT OF WATER IN IT MAKES ONE'S ARMS ACHE AND HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK SINGING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF THE NIGHTS ARE VERY DAMP IN DIGGING THINGS OUT OF THE GROUND WHICH YOU PROBABLY DO NOW AND THEN THE PROFESSOR BEGAN IN A LOUD VOICE
HAD NOT THE MICROCOSM AT MY FEET STIRRED MY CURIOSITY YET MORE KEENLY ONE ANCIENT CRAB THAT WAS FOR EVER SHUFFLING FRANTICALLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF THE POOL
IN A SMOCK FROCK WHO SAT WITH ROUNDED SHOULDERS AND DROOPING HEAD AND WITH HANDS CLASPED ON THE TOP OF HIS STICK SO AS TO MAKE A SORT OF PILLOW FOR THAT WRINKLED FACE WITH ITS LOOK OF PATIENT WEARINESS COME YOU BE OFF THE STATION MASTER ROUGHLY ACCOSTED THE POOR OLD MAN
HOWEVER THE PARTY WITH THE ADDITION OF A GENTLEMAN AS GOOD NATURED AND AS ROSY AS THE CHILDREN SEATED THEMSELVES AT IT VERY CONTENTEDLY YOU HAVE SEEN PEOPLE EATING CHERRY TART AND EVERY NOW AND THEN CAUTIOUSLY CONVEYING A CHERRY STONE FROM THEIR LIPS TO THEIR PLATES
IS QUITE NONSENSE ENOUGH FOR ONE WHILE SAID THE EARL
DON'T YOU BE A GREAT BLETHERING GOOSE
HE'S JUST UNDER HERE SAID UGGUG WHO HAD GONE TO THE WINDOW AND WAS LOOKING DOWN INTO THE COURT YARD
BUT I'M SURE HE WOULD FOR YOU DO COME AND ASK HIM PROFESSOR DEAR I'LL COME THIS MINUTE SAID THE PROFESSOR BRUNO SAT UP AND DRIED HIS EYES ISN'T HE KIND MISTER SIR HE IS INDEED SAID I
AND I KNOW SOME OF THE LADY SOCIETY ALREADY I ADDED ONE OF THEM CAME IN THE SAME CARRIAGE WITH ME WHAT WAS SHE LIKE THEN PERHAPS I CAN IDENTIFY HER THE NAME WAS LADY MURIEL ORME
TO THE ADDRESS LEGIBLE ON THE PILE OF LUGGAGE WHICH ANNOUNCED THEIR OWNER TO BE LADY MURIEL ORME PASSENGER TO ELVESTON VIA FAYFIELD JUNCTION AS I WATCHED THE OLD MAN SLOWLY RISE TO HIS FEET AND HOBBLE A FEW PACES DOWN THE PLATFORM
IT IS NOT QUITE CONVENIENT THE FOURTH ARRIVED AND PUNCTUAL PAUL CAME WITH HIS LEGAL FRIEND AT NOON I THOUGHT IT BEST SAID HE TO CALL ONE CANNOT SETTLE THINGS TOO SOON POOR PETER SHUDDERED IN DESPAIR
THERE ISN'T SUCH A DOG AS THAT SYLVIE THOUGHTFULLY REMARKED BUT THERE WOULD BE CRIED BRUNO IF THE PROFESSOR SHORTENED IT UP FOR US
THE VICE WARDEN INTERRUPTED YOUR POSITION AS COURT PROFESSOR MAKES IT AWKWARD I ADMIT
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE AN OUTLANDISH WATCH AS I ENTERED THE LITTLE TOWN I CAME UPON TWO OF THE FISHERMEN'S WIVES INTERCHANGING THAT LAST WORD WHICH NEVER WAS THE LAST AND IT OCCURRED TO ME AS AN EXPERIMENT WITH THE MAGIC WATCH
RESOLVED TO GUARD THE TREASURE EVEN AT THE SACRIFICE OF LIFE AND A FRONT DOOR STANDING INVITINGLY HALF OPEN HERE IS MY CHANCE I THOUGHT FOR TESTING THE REVERSE ACTION OF THE MAGIC WATCH I PRESSED THE REVERSAL PEG AND WALKED IN
TO WAIT TILL THE LITTLE SCENE WAS OVER AND THEN TO ENCORE IT WELL GOOD NIGHT AND YE
A MAN MAY SURELY CLAIM HIS DUES BUT WHEN THERE'S MONEY TO BE LENT A MAN MUST BE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE SUCH TIMES AS ARE CONVENIENT IT CHANCED ONE DAY AS PETER SAT GNAWING A CRUST HIS USUAL MEAL
AND LOVE ALONE COULD EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON HOW CONVENIENT IT WOULD BE
I WAS PASSING A PRETTY LITTLE VILLA WHICH STOOD RATHER BACK FROM THE ROAD IN ITS OWN GROUNDS WITH BRIGHT FLOWER BEDS IN FRONT CREEPERS WANDERING OVER THE WALLS AND HANGING IN FESTOONS ABOUT THE BOW WINDOWS AN EASY CHAIR FORGOTTEN ON THE LAWN WITH A NEWSPAPER LYING NEAR IT
AT HOME LAWN TENNIS THREE P M AT HOME KETTLEDRUM FIVE P M AT HOME MUSIC ELVESTON DOESN'T GIVE DINNERS EIGHT P M CARRIAGES AT TEN THERE YOU ARE IT SOUNDED VERY PLEASANT I WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT
AND SUCH HORRID MEALS WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR DINNER TO DAY SAID THE PROFESSOR A LITTLE PIECE OF A DEAD CROW WAS BRUNO'S MOURNFUL REPLY HE MEANS ROOK PIE SYLVIE EXPLAINED
HERE WE HAVE AN OLD MAN AND A CHILD QUITE AT THEIR EASE TALKING AS IF THEY HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS THEN YOU THINK I CONTINUED ALOUD THAT WE OUGHT SOMETIMES TO ASK A GHOST TO SIT DOWN BUT HAVE WE ANY AUTHORITY FOR IT
AND A COURT JESTER THE VICE WARDEN AND HIS WIFE SHOOK WITH WELL ACTED MERRIMENT NOT IN THIS ROOM DARLING SAID THE FOND MOTHER
SOMETHING OF AN ANALOGOUS CHARACTER IS MORE AND MORE APPARENT IN EUROPE AMONGST THE CAUSES WHICH PRODUCE THESE SIMILAR CONSEQUENCES IN BOTH HEMISPHERES SEVERAL ARE SO CONNECTED WITH MY SUBJECT AS TO DESERVE NOTICE
MAY ULTIMATELY BE ESTABLISHED IN THE WORLD WHICH WOULD NOT CORRUPT BUT
AS SOON AS A MAN BEGINS TO TREAT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS IN PUBLIC
AND THAT AMBITION SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO FIX ITS GAZE LONG UPON AN OBJECT BEFORE IT IS GRATIFIED
EQUALITY WAS THEREFORE A FACT OF SOME STANDING WHEN FREEDOM WAS STILL A NOVELTY THE ONE HAD ALREADY CREATED CUSTOMS OPINIONS AND LAWS BELONGING TO IT
HE HAS LEARNED THE ART OF RESISTING THEM AND THAT HE HAS ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SACRIFICE WITHOUT AN EFFORT THE PLEASURE OF A MOMENT TO THE LASTING INTEREST OF HIS WHOLE LIFE
THE AMERICANS NOT ONLY FOLLOW THEIR RELIGION FROM INTEREST BUT THEY OFTEN PLACE IN THIS WORLD THE INTEREST WHICH MAKES THEM FOLLOW IT
HE WILLINGLY IMPOSES DUTIES ON HIMSELF TOWARDS THE FORMER AND THE LATTER AND HE WILL FREQUENTLY SACRIFICE HIS PERSONAL GRATIFICATIONS TO THOSE WHO WENT BEFORE AND TO THOSE WHO WILL COME AFTER HIM
THE PROPOSITION IN POINT OF PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS THE MOST OPULENT MEMBERS OF A DEMOCRACY WILL NOT DISPLAY TASTES VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE PEOPLE WHETHER IT BE THAT SPRINGING FROM THE PEOPLE THEY REALLY SHARE THOSE TASTES
APPROPRIATE TO THEIR CONDITION THAN THIS LOVE OF PHYSICAL PROSPERITY THE PASSION FOR PHYSICAL COMFORTS IS ESSENTIALLY A PASSION OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES WITH THOSE CLASSES IT GROWS AND SPREADS
IS THAT THEY HAVE ARRIVED AT A STATE OF DEMOCRACY WITHOUT HAVING TO ENDURE A DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION
MORE OR LESS PROFITABLE BUT THEY ARE NEVER EITHER HIGH OR LOW EVERY HONEST CALLING
IF HE SHOULD HAVE CONCEIVED ANY DOUBTS AS TO THE OBJECT OF HIS HOPES STILL HE WILL NOT EASILY ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE STOPPED BY THEM AND HE WILL DECIDE THAT IT IS WISE TO RISK SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS WORLD
AND OF FEAR IT IS THEN COMMONLY AT THE OUTSET OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY THAT CITIZENS ARE MOST DISPOSED TO LIVE APART DEMOCRACY LEADS MEN NOT TO DRAW NEAR TO THEIR FELLOW CREATURES
AS IF THE END AND AIM OF HUMAN ACTIONS APPEARED EVERY DAY TO BE MORE WITHIN HIS REACH
THEY RISK THEIR DEAREST INTERESTS THEY ARE DEAF SHOW THEM NOT FREEDOM ESCAPING FROM THEIR GRASP WHILST THEY ARE LOOKING ANOTHER WAY THEY ARE BLIND OR RATHER
AND CLING TO MORE ARDUOUS AND MORE LOFTY UNDERTAKINGS WHICH EXCITE AND ENGROSS THEIR MINDS HENCE IT IS THAT IN THE MIDST OF PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS
DISSOLUTE ARISTOCRACIES MOST OF THESE WEALTHY PERSONS WERE ONCE POOR THEY HAVE FELT THE STING OF WANT THEY WERE LONG A PREY TO ADVERSE FORTUNES AND NOW THAT THE VICTORY IS WON
AND AS THEY DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THEY CAN HENCEFORWARD EVER HAVE OCCASION TO CLAIM THE ASSISTANCE OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES THEY DO NOT SCRUPLE TO SHOW THAT THEY CARE FOR NOBODY BUT THEMSELVES
TOWARDS WHICH ALL THEIR EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED THEY DO NOT TURN FROM DAY TO DAY TO CHASE SOME NOVEL OBJECT OF DESIRE
CHRISTIANITY INDEED TEACHES THAT A MAN MUST PREFER HIS NEIGHBOR TO HIMSELF IN ORDER TO GAIN ETERNAL LIFE BUT CHRISTIANITY ALSO TEACHES THAT MEN OUGHT TO BENEFIT THEIR FELLOW CREATURES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
TO THE EARTH AND IT IS ONLY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT THEY CAN DIVERT THEIR ATTENTION FROM IT TO TOUCH THEIR CONGREGATIONS THEY ALWAYS SHOW THEM HOW FAVORABLE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS ARE TO FREEDOM AND PUBLIC TRANQUILLITY
OR EVEN TO INSTITUTIONS WHOLLY WITHOUT FREEDOM ALTHOUGH MEN CANNOT BECOME ABSOLUTELY EQUAL UNLESS THEY BE ENTIRELY FREE AND CONSEQUENTLY EQUALITY PUSHED TO ITS FURTHEST EXTENT
IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THERE ARE FEW PUBLIC OFFICERS WHO DO NOT AFFECT TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY WITHOUT INTERESTED MOTIVES THEIR SALARY IS AN INCIDENT OF WHICH THEY THINK BUT LITTLE
TO PLANT AN ORCHARD TO ENLARGE A DWELLING TO BE ALWAYS MAKING LIFE MORE COMFORTABLE AND CONVENIENT TO AVOID TROUBLE AND TO SATISFY THE SMALLEST WANTS WITHOUT EFFORT AND ALMOST WITHOUT COST THESE ARE SMALL OBJECTS
ONLY SAPS THE VIRTUES OF PUBLIC LIFE BUT IN THE LONG RUN IT ATTACKS AND DESTROYS ALL OTHERS AND IS AT LENGTH ABSORBED IN DOWNRIGHT EGOTISM
AND FLIES TO SEEK ITS PLEASURES FAR BEYOND WHEN ON THE CONTRARY THE DISTINCTIONS OF RANKS ARE CONFOUNDED TOGETHER AND PRIVILEGES ARE DESTROYED WHEN
DISTURB THE PEACE OF FAMILIES AND THREATEN THE SECURITY OF SOCIETY AT LARGE SUCH IS NOT THE CASE THE PASSION FOR PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS PRODUCES IN DEMOCRACIES EFFECTS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH IT OCCASIONS
NO PROFESSION EXISTS IN WHICH MEN DO NOT WORK FOR MONEY AND THE REMUNERATION WHICH IS COMMON TO THEM ALL GIVES THEM ALL AN AIR OF RESEMBLANCE
THAT THIS WAY THEY STRIKE INTO THE MULTITUDE AND BECOME POPULAR IT IS NOT EASY CLEARLY TO PERCEIVE WHY THE PRINCIPLE OF INTEREST RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD SHOULD KEEP ALOOF FROM RELIGIOUS OPINIONS
EQUALITY PLACES MEN SIDE BY SIDE UNCONNECTED BY ANY COMMON TIE DESPOTISM RAISES BARRIERS TO KEEP THEM ASUNDER THE FORMER PREDISPOSES THEM NOT TO CONSIDER THEIR FELLOW CREATURES
THE INTEREST OF MAN IS CONFINED TO THOSE IN CLOSE PROPINQUITY TO HIMSELF AS EACH CLASS APPROXIMATES TO OTHER CLASSES AND INTERMINGLES WITH THEM
IT IS EASIER THAN THEY THINK TO CONCEIVE AND TO EXECUTE PROTRACTED UNDERTAKINGS HE MUST TEACH THEM THAT
AND IN ORDER TO TASTE THEM NOTHING IS REQUIRED BUT TO LIVE DEMOCRATIC NATIONS ARE AT ALL TIMES FOND OF EQUALITY
AN ARISTOCRACY SELDOM YIELDS WITHOUT A PROTRACTED STRUGGLE IN THE COURSE OF WHICH IMPLACABLE ANIMOSITIES ARE KINDLED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SOCIETY
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ALSO WORKS FOR PAY HE IS PAID FOR COMMANDING OTHER MEN FOR OBEYING ORDERS
ABSOLUTE KINGS WERE THE MOST EFFICIENT LEVELLERS OF RANKS AMONGST THEIR SUBJECTS AMONGST THESE NATIONS EQUALITY PRECEDED FREEDOM
FOR WHICH THE PRESENT GENERATION TAKES BUT LITTLE THOUGHT THE EVILS WHICH FREEDOM SOMETIMES BRINGS WITH IT ARE IMMEDIATE THEY ARE APPARENT TO ALL AND ALL ARE MORE OR LESS AFFECTED BY THEM
I MAY HERE BE MET BY AN OBJECTION DERIVED FROM ELECTIONEERING INTRIGUES THE MEANNESSES OF CANDIDATES AND THE CALUMNIES OF THEIR OPPONENTS
THAN TO FELICITY HEREAFTER AND THIS IS ONE OF THEIR CHIEF POLITICAL CHARACTERISTICS BUT IN PROPORTION AS THE LIGHT OF FAITH GROWS DIM THE RANGE OF MAN'S SIGHT IS CIRCUMSCRIBED
IN SPITE OF THE PROPENSITIES WHICH SEVER THEM
OR SERVICES IT IS DESIRABLE THAT EVERY ADVANCEMENT SHOULD THERE APPEAR TO BE THE RESULT OF SOME EFFORT SO THAT NO GREATNESS SHOULD BE OF TOO EASY ACQUIREMENT
FREEDOM HAS APPEARED IN THE WORLD AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND UNDER VARIOUS FORMS IT HAS NOT BEEN EXCLUSIVELY BOUND TO ANY SOCIAL CONDITION AND IT IS NOT CONFINED TO DEMOCRACIES
VAST INTERESTS WERE AT STAKE ALL OF THE TECHNICAL EXPERT AND PROFESSIONAL SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE THAT MONEY COULD PROCURE OR EXPERIENCE DEVISE WERE AVAILED OF IN THE BITTER FIGHTS THAT RAGED IN THE COURTS FOR MANY YEARS
IN WHICH HE CONTEMPLATED THE AUTOMATIC HANDLING OF MANY THOUSANDS OF TONS OF MATERIAL DAILY IT MAY BE STATED AS BROADLY TRUE THAT EDISON ENGINEERED TO HANDLE IMMENSE MASSES OF STUFF AUTOMATICALLY WHILE HIS PREDECESSORS AIMED CHIEFLY AT CLOSE SEPARATION
THE SPACE BETWEEN THESE TWO ROLLS ALLOWED PIECES OF ROCK MEASURING LESS THAN FOURTEEN INCHES TO DESCEND TO OTHER SMALLER ROLLS PLACED BELOW THE GIANT ROLLS WERE BELT DRIVEN IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THROUGH FRICTION CLUTCHES ALTHOUGH THE BELT WAS NOT DEPENDED UPON FOR THE ACTUAL CRUSHING
THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF THESE ENTERPRISES IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED AND FORGOTTEN IN THIS INSTANCE IT WAS OF MORE THAN USUAL IMPORT AND SERIOUSNESS AS EDISON WAS VIRTUALLY HIS OWN BACKER PUTTING INTO THE COMPANY ALMOST THE WHOLE OF ALL THE FORTUNE HIS INVENTIONS HAD BROUGHT HIM
THE DETERMINING FACTOR OF POLARITY BEING THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT
OR THE OTHER POLE OF A BATTERY TO THE LINE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY GROUND THE OTHER POLE THIS ACTION OF THE POLE CHANGER IS EFFECTED BY MOVEMENTS OF THE ARMATURE OF AN ELECTROMAGNET THROUGH THE MANIPULATION OF AN ORDINARY TELEGRAPH KEY
ASSUMING FOR INSTANCE THE BAR TO BE END ON TOWARD THE OBSERVER THAT END WILL BE A SOUTH POLE IF THE CURRENT IS FLOWING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT CLOCKWISE AROUND THE BAR
HAVING TAKEN A SOMEWHAT SUPERFICIAL SURVEY OF THE GREAT ENTERPRISE UNDER CONSIDERATION
IN A SHORT TIME HE BECAME SALIVATED AND HIS TEETH GOT LOOSE HE WENT HOME AND SHORTLY HIS MOTHER APPEARED AT THE LABORATORY WITH A HORSEWHIP WHICH SHE PROPOSED TO USE ON THE PROPRIETOR I WAS FORTUNATELY ABSENT AND SHE WAS MOLLIFIED SOMEHOW BY MY OTHER ASSISTANTS
WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD
THESE FIGURES PROVE THAT THE YIELD OF THE FURNACE IS CONSIDERABLY INCREASED THE CRANE TRIAL WAS TOO SHORT TO SETTLE THE QUESTION TO WHAT EXTENT THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT MAY BE CARRIED THIS INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF COURSE MEANS A REDUCTION IN THE COST OF LABOR AND OF GENERAL EXPENSES
WAS THE OTHER BRANCH ALL WERE CONNECTED WITH WIRES GOULD SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE FISK BEING THE EXECUTIVE DOWN TOWN FISK WORE A VELVET CORDUROY COAT AND A VERY PECULIAR VEST HE WAS VERY CHIPPER AND SEEMED TO BE LIGHT HEARTED AND HAPPY
IT WORKED IN THE SAME WAY AS AN ORDINARY COUNTER ONE WHEEL MADE TEN REVOLUTIONS AND AT THE TENTH IT ADVANCED THE ADJACENT WHEEL AND THIS IN ITS TURN HAVING GONE TEN REVOLUTIONS ADVANCED THE NEXT WHEEL AND SO ON
AND I ATTENDED THE DINNER CELEBRATING THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DISCOVERY OF PHOTOGRAPHY THEN THEY SENT TO REID MY DECORATION AND THEY TRIED TO PUT A SASH ON ME BUT I COULD NOT STAND FOR THAT MY WIFE HAD ME WEAR THE LITTLE RED BUTTON BUT WHEN I SAW AMERICANS COMING
I KEPT THIS POSITION MADE MANY IMPROVEMENTS DEVISED SEVERAL STOCK TICKERS UNTIL THE GOLD AND STOCK TELEGRAPH COMPANY CONSOLIDATED WITH THE GOLD INDICATOR COMPANY
TO PREVENT FIRES IN HIS ELECTRIC LIGHT SYSTEM WAS AGAIN DISPLAYED IN THIS CONCENTRATING PLANT WHERE TO SAVE POSSIBLE INJURY TO ITS EXPENSIVE OPERATING PARTS HE DEVISED AN ANALOGOUS FACTOR PROVIDING ALL THE CRUSHING MACHINERY WITH CLOSELY CALCULATED SAFETY PINS
SOON ALL THE MEN GOT SALIVATED AND THINGS LOOKED SERIOUS BUT I FOUND THAT IN THE MIRROR FACTORIES WHERE MERCURY WAS USED EXTENSIVELY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT MADE THE GIVING OF IODIDE OF POTASSIUM COMPULSORY TO PREVENT SALIVATION
AND ATTACHED TO THE LOWER END OF THIS BENT PIECE IS A POST OR STANDARD TO WHICH THE MAIN BATTERY IS ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED
AND IS HERE REPRODUCED IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ADVERTISEMENT ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE TELEGRAPHER AND APPEARING FREQUENTLY WAS NOT PAID FOR AT FULL RATES AS THE PUBLISHER MISTER J N ASHLEY BECAME A PARTNER IN THE FIRM
THE OFFICIAL REGISTRAR OF THE GOLD BOARD DOCTOR LAWS WHO AFTERWARD BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI WAS AN INVENTOR OF UNUSUAL ABILITY AND ATTAINMENTS IN HIS EARLY YOUTH HE HAD EARNED HIS LIVELIHOOD IN A TOOL FACTORY
ONE NEED NOT WONDER AT EDISON'S REMINISCENT REMARK THAT IN ANY TRADE ANY OF MY BOYS MADE WITH BERGMANN HE ALWAYS GOT THE BEST OF THEM NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS ONE TIME THERE WAS TO BE A CONVENTION OF THE MANAGERS OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES AT CHICAGO
I DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WOULD DECOMPOSE BY WATER I POURED IN A BEAKERFUL OF WATER AND THE WHOLE THING EXPLODED AND THREW A LOT OF IT INTO MY EYES I RAN TO THE HYDRANT LEANED OVER BACKWARD OPENED MY EYES
IS SEEN TO CONSIST OF TWO ROWS OF ROUND RODS OR PENCILS THIRTY IN NUMBER HELD IN A VERTICAL POSITION BY A STEEL SUPPORT FRAME THE PENCILS HAVE FLAT FLANGES AT THE ENDS
ARE CONNECTED TO EARTH THERE IS A BATTERY C AND A KEY K WHEN THE KEY IS DEPRESSED CURRENT FLOWS THROUGH THE RELAY COILS AT A BUT NO MAGNETISM IS PRODUCED AS THEY OPPOSE EACH OTHER
AS WE HAD THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE CONCENTRATING PROBLEM WE MUST IF POSSIBLE APPLY IT TO SOME PRACTICAL USE AND AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST WORK OUT SOME OTHER PLANS BY WHICH WE COULD MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY OFF THE CONCENTRATING COMPANY'S INDEBTEDNESS
THE MAGNETIC PARTICLES ARE ATTRACTED OUT OF THE STRAIGHT LINE OF THE FALLING STREAM AND BEING HEAVY GRAVITATE INWARDLY AND FALL TO ONE SIDE OF A PARTITION PLACED BELOW THE NON MAGNETIC GANGUE DESCENDS IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARTITION THUS A COMPLETE SEPARATION IS EFFECTED
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HE NEVER UNTIL LONG PAST FIFTY
AT HEIDELBERG MY ASSISTANT MISTER WANGEMANN AN ACCOMPLISHED GERMAN AMERICAN SHOWED THE PHONOGRAPH BEFORE THE ASSOCIATION THEN CAME THE TRIP FROM THE CONTINENT TO ENGLAND OF WHICH THIS WILL CERTAINLY PASS AS A GRAPHIC PICTURE
AND WHAT PARTICULAR KIND OF FOOD WOULD BE MOST SATISFYING AND FILLING THE RESULT WAS THAT AT SMITH AND MC NELL'S HE DECIDED ON APPLE DUMPLINGS AND A CUP OF COFFEE
THE OTHER OPENED TOWARD THE STREET WITHIN THE EXCHANGE THE FACE COULD EASILY BE SEEN HIGH UP ON THE WEST WALL OF THE ROOM AND THE MACHINE WAS OPERATED
AND IT CERTAINLY LOOKED AWFUL TOUGH OUTSIDE I SAID TO THE MAN WILL THAT BOAT LIVE IN THAT SEA OH YES HE SAID BUT WE'VE HAD A BAD STORM SO I MADE UP MY MIND THAT PERHAPS I WOULD GET SICK THIS TIME
SIEMENS WOULD QUICKLY IN GERMAN EXPLAIN THE POINT BUT HELMHOLTZ COULD NOT SEE IT ALTHOUGH HE UNDERSTOOD ENGLISH WHICH SIEMENS COULD SPEAK STILL THE EXPLANATIONS WERE MADE IN GERMAN
THEY COMMENCED TO GET SICK SO I FELT PRETTY SURE I WAS IN FOR IT WE STARTED OUT OF THE LITTLE INLET AND GOT INTO THE CHANNEL AND THAT BOAT WENT IN SEVENTEEN DIRECTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY I WAITED AWHILE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING TO OCCUR AND THEN WENT INTO THE SMOKING COMPARTMENT
OF THESE ONE FURNISHED THE CURRENT FOR THE ALPHABET WHEEL ONE FOR THE FIGURE WHEEL
THIS WAS MADE EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE AS THEY DID NOT HAVE THE EXPERTS WE HAD IN NEW YORK TO HANDLE ANYTHING COMPLICATED THE SAME TICKER WAS USED ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE
TO FIT INTO THE TEETH OF THE REVERSED RATCHET WHEEL
HENCE IF WE CONNECT ONE POLE OF A BATTERY WITH THE EARTH AND FROM THE OTHER POLE
AND DISPENSING WITH THE REGIMENTS OF NOISY BOYS HE SECURED THIS PRIVILEGE OF DISTRIBUTION AND RESIGNING FROM THE EXCHANGE DEVOTED HIS EXCLUSIVE ATTENTION TO THE GOLD REPORTING TELEGRAPH WHICH HE PATENTED AND FOR WHICH AT THE END OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
AND A BEAM OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE CONDENSER BEING EXPOSED BY THE SHUTTER DURING THE PERIODS OF REST THIS RESULTS IN A PROJECTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS UPON A SCREEN IN SUCH RAPID SUCCESSION AS TO PRESENT AN APPARENTLY CONTINUOUS PHOTOGRAPH OF THE SUCCESSIVE POSITIONS OF THE MOVING OBJECTS
IN APRIL OF THAT YEAR HOWEVER EDISON TOOK UP THE STUDY OF THE SUBJECT AND FILED TWO APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS
IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD OF COURSE THAT THE POLAR RELAY AS USED IN THE QUADRUPLEX SYSTEM IS WOUND DIFFERENTIALLY AND THEREFORE ITS OPERATION IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN PRINCIPLE TO THAT OF THE DIFFERENTIALLY WOUND NEUTRAL RELAY
TWO POINT FIVE SEVEN TWO
WHICH BESIDES HAVING A VERY LARGE WORKING CAPACITY BY GRAVITY ELIMINATED ALL POWER EXCEPT THAT REQUIRED TO ELEVATE THE MATERIAL THE SCREENING PROCESS ALLOWED THE FINEST PART OF THE CRUSHED ROCK TO PASS ON BY CONVEYOR BELTS TO THE MAGNETIC SEPARATORS
THE CONCENTRATING WORKS HAD BEEN IN OPERATION AND WE HAD PRODUCED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF THE BRIQUETTES AND HAD BEEN ABLE TO SELL ONLY A PORTION OF THEM THE IRON MARKET BEING IN SUCH CONDITION THAT BLAST FURNACES WERE NOT MAKING ANY NEW PURCHASES OF IRON ORE
WAS WHAT BROUGHT HIM VERY PROMINENTLY BEFORE THE NOTICE OF THE PUBLIC DUPLEX TELEGRAPHY OR THE SENDING OF TWO SEPARATE MESSAGES IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME OVER ONE LINE WAS KNOWN AND PRACTICED PREVIOUS TO THIS TIME
THE TREMENDOUSLY COMPLEX NATURE OF THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE LEAD ACID STORAGE BATTERY ALSO RENDERS IT AN EASY PREY TO MANY TROUBLESOME DISEASES IN THE YEAR NINETEEN HUNDRED WHEN EDISON UNDERTOOK TO INVENT A STORAGE BATTERY
NO LESS EFFECTUALLY THAN BY SUCH A LUXURIOUS LIFE AS WILL SHUT OUT DISCONTENT BY CUTTING OFF THE OCCASION FOR IT THE ABJECTLY POOR AND ALL THOSE PERSONS WHOSE ENERGIES ARE ENTIRELY ABSORBED BY THE STRUGGLE FOR DAILY SUSTENANCE
AS WELL AS OUR NOTIONS OF WHAT ARE THE FIT AND ADEQUATE MANNER AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF DIVINE COMMUNION IT IS FELT THAT THE DIVINITY MUST BE OF A PECULIARLY SERENE AND LEISURELY HABIT OF LIFE AND WHENEVER HIS LOCAL HABITATION IS PICTURED IN POETIC IMAGERY
IN CASES WHERE THE PREDATORY ACTIVITY IS A COLLECTIVE ONE THIS PROPENSITY IS FREQUENTLY CALLED THE MARTIAL SPIRIT OR LATTERLY PATRIOTISM IT NEEDS NO INSISTENCE TO FIND ASSENT TO THE PROPOSITION
MAY OFFSET A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN THE RESISTANCE OFFERED BY EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE UNFOLDING OF LIFE IN THE GIVEN DIRECTION
THROUGH HIS HABITUALLY CONTEMPLATING IT AND ASSIMILATING THE SCHEME OF LIFE IN WHICH IT BELONGS BUT IT DOES SO ALSO INDIRECTLY THROUGH POPULAR INSISTENCE ON CONFORMITY TO THE ACCEPTED SCALE OF EXPENDITURE AS A MATTER OF PROPRIETY UNDER PAIN OF DISESTEEM AND OSTRACISM
AND SO THEY MAKE ALSO FOR THE DISPENSABILITY OF THE GREAT LEISURE CLASS FUNCTION OF OWNERSHIP
AND IT IS THEIR OFFICE BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE TO SET FORTH THIS SCHEME OF SOCIAL SALVATION IN ITS HIGHEST IDEAL FORM BUT THE HIGHER LEISURE CLASS CAN EXERCISE THIS QUASI SACERDOTAL OFFICE ONLY UNDER CERTAIN MATERIAL LIMITATIONS
IN ORDINARY TIMES THE LARGE BODY OF THE INDUSTRIAL CLASSES IS RELATIVELY APATHETIC TOUCHING WARLIKE INTERESTS WHEN UNEXCITED THIS BODY OF THE COMMON PEOPLE WHICH MAKES UP THE EFFECTIVE FORCE OF THE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY
BUT IT MAY AS WELL BE DEALT WITH HERE SINCE IT HAS AT LEAST THIS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE CONSERVATIVE HABIT OF MIND THAT IT ACTS TO RETARD INNOVATION AND THE GROWTH OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE
THE SACRED BUILDINGS AND THE OTHER PROPERTIES OF THE CULT ARE CONSTRUCTED AND DECORATED WITH SOME VIEW TO A REPUTABLE DEGREE OF WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE AND IT NEEDS BUT LITTLE EITHER OF OBSERVATION OR INTROSPECTION AND EITHER WILL SERVE THE TURN
NOR THAT OF BEAUTY ALONE CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE STANDARD OF REPUTABILITY REQUIRES THAT DRESS SHOULD SHOW WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE BUT ALL WASTEFULNESS IS OFFENSIVE TO NATIVE TASTE
BUT AS EACH INNOVATION IS SUBJECT TO THE SELECTIVE ACTION OF THE NORM OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE THE RANGE WITHIN WHICH INNOVATION CAN TAKE PLACE IS SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED THE INNOVATION MUST NOT ONLY BE MORE BEAUTIFUL
THE HOMELY REASON FOR ALL THIS CONSPICUOUS LEISURE AND ATTIRE ON THE PART OF WOMEN LIES IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SERVANTS TO WHOM IN THE DIFFERENTIATION OF ECONOMIC FUNCTIONS
THAT THE PUERILE SPIRITUAL MAKE UP OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UPPER AND THE LOWEST SOCIAL STRATA SHOWS ITSELF ALSO IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER ARCHAIC TRAITS THAN THIS PROCLIVITY TO FEROCIOUS EXPLOIT AND ISOLATION
IN THE LOWER OR SPURIOUS LEISURE CLASS OF THE DELINQUENTS THERE IS IN ALL COUNTRIES A SIMILAR THOUGH LESS FORMAL SOCIAL OBLIGATION INCUMBENT ON THE ROWDY TO ASSERT HIS MANHOOD IN UNPROVOKED COMBAT WITH HIS FELLOWS AND SPREADING THROUGH ALL GRADES OF SOCIETY
THE EFFECT OF THIS FACTOR OF THE STANDARD OF LIVING BOTH IN THE WAY OF RETRENCHMENT IN THE OBSCURER ELEMENTS OF CONSUMPTION THAT GO TO PHYSICAL COMFORT AND MAINTENANCE AND ALSO IN THE PAUCITY OR ABSENCE OF CHILDREN
WHILE IN OTHERS THIS ETHNIC ELEMENT IS FOUND CHIEFLY AMONG THE HEREDITARY LEISURE CLASS THE FIGHTING HABIT SEEMS TO PREVAIL TO A LESS EXTENT AMONG THE WORKING CLASS BOYS IN THE LATTER CLASS OF POPULATIONS THAN AMONG THE BOYS OF THE UPPER CLASSES
WHICH SUCH A RADICAL CHANGE IN ANY ONE FEATURE OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF LIFE WOULD INVOLVE IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO SUGGEST THE SUPPRESSION OF THE MONOGAMIC FAMILY OR OF THE AGNATIC SYSTEM OF CONSANGUINITY OR OF PRIVATE PROPERTY
IS SET BY THE USAGE OF THOSE NEXT ABOVE US IN REPUTABILITY UNTIL IN THIS WAY ESPECIALLY IN ANY COMMUNITY WHERE CLASS DISTINCTIONS ARE SOMEWHAT VAGUE ALL CANONS OF REPUTABILITY AND DECENCY AND ALL STANDARDS OF CONSUMPTION
ARE MORE READILY DETECTED IN THEIR STRUCTURE THESE RELATIVELY STABLE COSTUMES ARE COMMONLY PRETTY STRICTLY AND NARROWLY LOCALIZED AND THEY VARY BY SLIGHT AND SYSTEMATIC GRADATIONS FROM PLACE TO PLACE
THAN THE ONE IMMEDIATELY IN QUESTION THE AVERSION TO ANY SUCH INNOVATION AMOUNTS TO A SHRINKING FROM AN ESSENTIALLY ALIEN SCHEME OF LIFE THE REVULSION FELT BY GOOD PEOPLE AT ANY PROPOSED DEPARTURE FROM THE ACCEPTED METHODS OF LIFE
WHEN AN ATTEMPTED REFORM INVOLVES THE SUPPRESSION OR THOROUGH GOING REMODELLING OF AN INSTITUTION OF FIRST RATE IMPORTANCE IN THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME IT IS IMMEDIATELY FELT THAT A SERIOUS DERANGEMENT OF THE ENTIRE SCHEME WOULD RESULT
AND THE BEARING OF THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE UPON SOME OF THE COMMONPLACE DEVOUT OBSERVANCES AND CONCEITS MAY THEREFORE BE POINTED OUT OBVIOUSLY THE CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR A GREAT PORTION OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED DEVOUT CONSUMPTION AS E G
IN THE LATTER CASE THE SANCTUARY AND THE SACRED APPARATUS ARE SO CONTRIVED AS NOT TO ENHANCE THE COMFORT OR FULLNESS OF LIFE OF THE VICARIOUS CONSUMER OR AT ANY RATE NOT TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT THE END OF THEIR CONSUMPTION IS THE CONSUMER'S COMFORT
THERE SHOULD BE NO SHOW OF AGILITY OR OF DEXTEROUS MANIPULATION IN THE EXECUTION OF THE PRIESTLY OFFICE SUCH AS MIGHT SUGGEST A CAPACITY FOR TURNING OFF THE WORK
ORDINARILY WITH A VIEW TO HEIGHTENING THE SPECTACULAR EFFECT OF THE AGGREGATE EXPENDITURE CONTEMPLATED AS INCREASED INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO PROCURE THE MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD WITH LESS LABOR
CAME TO BE PART OF THE SERVICES REQUIRED OF THEM THE WOMEN BEING NOT THEIR OWN MASTERS OBVIOUS EXPENDITURE AND LEISURE ON THEIR PART WOULD REDOUND TO THE CREDIT OF THEIR MASTER RATHER THAN TO THEIR OWN CREDIT AND THEREFORE
ESPECIALLY AS THEY MARK A MORE OR LESS EVIDENT TREND IN THE LATER AND MATURER DEVELOPMENT OF DRESS THE VOGUE OF THE CORSET OFFERS AN APPARENT EXCEPTION FROM THE RULE OF WHICH IT HAS HERE BEEN CITED AS AN ILLUSTRATION
THE DIFFICULTY IN THE WAY OF RECEDING FROM AN ACCUSTOMED STANDARD IS THE DIFFICULTY OF BREAKING A HABIT THAT HAS ONCE BEEN FORMED THE RELATIVE FACILITY WITH WHICH AN ADVANCE IN THE STANDARD IS MADE MEANS THAT THE LIFE PROCESS IS A PROCESS OF UNFOLDING ACTIVITY
THE MORE PERSISTENTLY WILL THE GIVEN HABIT ASSERT ITSELF THE HABIT WILL BE STRONGER IF THE PARTICULAR TRAITS OF HUMAN NATURE WHICH ITS ACTION INVOLVES OR THE PARTICULAR APTITUDES THAT FIND EXERCISE IN IT ARE TRAITS OR APTITUDES THAT ARE ALREADY LARGELY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERNED IN THE LIFE PROCESS
THIS ARRESTED SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT MAY EXPRESS ITSELF NOT ONLY IN A DIRECT PARTICIPATION BY ADULTS IN YOUTHFUL EXPLOITS OF FEROCITY BUT ALSO INDIRECTLY IN AIDING AND ABETTING DISTURBANCES OF THIS KIND ON THE PART OF YOUNGER PERSONS
DISTURBANCES OF THE PEACE IN VOGUE AMONG SCHOOLBOYS OF A SLIGHTLY HIGHER AGE IN THE COMMON RUN OF CASES THESE DISTURBANCES ARE CONFINED TO THE PERIOD OF ADOLESCENCE THEY RECUR WITH DECREASING FREQUENCY AND ACUTENESS AS YOUTH MERGES INTO ADULT LIFE
THAT IN THE COUNTRIES OF CIVILIZED EUROPE THE HEREDITARY LEISURE CLASS IS ENDOWED WITH THIS MARTIAL SPIRIT IN A HIGHER DEGREE THAN THE MIDDLE CLASSES INDEED THE LEISURE CLASS CLAIMS THE DISTINCTION AS A MATTER OF PRIDE AND NO DOUBT WITH SOME GROUNDS
IT NEEDS NO ARGUMENT TO ENFORCE THE GENERALIZATION THAT THE MORE ELEGANT STYLES OF FEMININE BONNETS GO EVEN FARTHER TOWARDS MAKING WORK IMPOSSIBLE THAN DOES THE MAN'S HIGH HAT
WITH FEW AND INCONSEQUENTIAL EXCEPTIONS WE ALL FIND A COSTLY HAND WROUGHT ARTICLE OF APPAREL MUCH PREFERABLE IN POINT OF BEAUTY AND OF SERVICEABILITY TO A LESS EXPENSIVE IMITATION OF IT
BY A GRADUAL BUT SOMEWHAT RAPID OBSOLESCENCE OF THE INFANTILE FEATURES INTO THE TEMPERAMENT OF THE BOY PROPER THOUGH THERE ARE ALSO CASES WHERE THE PREDACEOUS FUTURES OF BOY LIFE DO NOT EMERGE AT ALL OR AT THE MOST EMERGE IN BUT A SLIGHT AND OBSCURE DEGREE
AND THAT IT WILL READILY UNFOLD IN A NEW DIRECTION WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THE RESISTANCE TO SELF EXPRESSION DECREASES BUT WHEN THE HABIT OF EXPRESSION ALONG SUCH A GIVEN LINE OF LOW RESISTANCE HAS ONCE BEEN FORMED
ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS CONSUMPTION CARRIED ON UNDER THE EYES OF OBSERVERS BUT A CONSIDERABLE ELEMENT OF PRESCRIPTIVE EXPENSIVENESS IS OBSERVABLE ALSO IN CONSUMPTION THAT DOES NOT IN ANY APPRECIABLE DEGREE BECOME KNOWN TO OUTSIDERS
THIS ASSIMILATION OF THE PRIESTLY CLASS TO THE CLASS OF BODY SERVANTS IN DEMEANOR AND APPAREL IS DUE TO THE SIMILARITY OF THE TWO CLASSES AS REGARDS ECONOMIC FUNCTION IN ECONOMIC THEORY THE PRIEST IS A BODY SERVANT
PARTLY ACTIVITIES DELIBERATELY ENTERED UPON WITH A VIEW TO GAINING REPUTE FOR PROWESS SPORTS OF ALL KINDS ARE OF THE SAME GENERAL CHARACTER INCLUDING PRIZE FIGHTS BULL FIGHTS ATHLETICS SHOOTING ANGLING YACHTING AND GAMES OF SKILL
AND FOR ACQUIRING FACILITY IN THE NEW AND LARGER SCALE OF EXPENDITURE THAT FOLLOWS SUCH AN INCREASE IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO RECEDE FROM A SCALE OF EXPENDITURE ONCE ADOPTED
THIS FEATURE TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER FACT THAT PROPRIETY REQUIRES MORE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EXPENSIVE DISPLAY IN THE DRESS AND OTHER PARAPHERNALIA OF WOMEN GOES TO ENFORCE THE VIEW ALREADY IMPLIED IN WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
I SHOULDN'T MIND IT SO MUCH IF WE LIVED THERE THE THOUGHTFUL CARPET HAD DUMPED THE CHILDREN DOWN IN A DUSKY SPACE BEHIND THE POINT WHERE THE CORNERS OF TWO STALLS MET THE FLOOR WAS LITTERED WITH STRING AND BROWN PAPER AND BASKETS AND BOXES WERE HEAPED ALONG THE WALL
AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS KNEELING ON THE LINOLEUM OF THE HALL TRYING TO KISS FOUR DAMP CHILDREN AT ONCE AND LAUGHING AND CRYING BY TURNS WHILE FATHER STOOD LOOKING ON AND SAYING HE WAS BLESSED OR SOMETHING
AND THE CARPET WAS LYING IN ITS PROPER PLACE ON THE NURSERY FLOOR AS CALM AND UNMOVED AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN TO THE THEATRE OR TAKEN PART IN A FIRE IN ITS LIFE
THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TATCHO FOR HAD PARAFFIN RUBBED INTO THEM WITH A PIECE OF FLANNEL THEN THE FLANNEL WAS BURNED IT MADE A GAY FLAME WHICH DELIGHTED THE PHOENIX AND THE LAMB HOW OFTEN SAID MOTHER OPENING THE DOOR
DO HURRY UP PANTHER SAID ROBERT AND THAT WAS WHY ANTHEA DID HURRY UP AND WHY THE BIG DARN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CARPET WAS ALL OPEN AND WEBBY LIKE A FISHING NET NOT TIGHT AND CLOSE LIKE WOVEN CLOTH WHICH IS WHAT A GOOD WELL BEHAVED DARN SHOULD BE
THE ONLY SMELL WAS THE STIFLING SMELL OF SMOKE OF BURNING SILK OR SCORCHING VARNISH THE LITTLE FLAMES HAD OPENED NOW INTO GREAT FLAME FLOWERS THE PEOPLE IN THE THEATRE WERE SHOUTING AND PRESSING TOWARDS THE DOORS
THE CARPET HAS DONE MANY WONDERS IN ITS DAY BUT THE CASE OF MISSUS BIDDLE IS I THINK THE MOST WONDERFUL
BUT I SHOULD THINK PARAFFIN WOULD DO AS WELL AT ANY RATE AS FAR AS THE SMELL GOES AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE GREAT THING ABOUT TATCHO BUT WITH ALL ITS FAULTS ANTHEA'S IDEA WAS SOMETHING TO DO AND THEY DID IT
ON THE TOP OF A HIGH GREY GLOOMY RESPECTABLE HOUSE
AND SO MAKE HER ANGRY AGAIN ANTHEA AND JANE HAD HELPED TO SELL THINGS AT THE RIVAL STALL SO THEY WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE POPULAR A HASTY COUNCIL OF FOUR DECIDED THAT MISSUS BIDDLE WOULD HATE CYRIL LESS THAN SHE WOULD HATE THE OTHERS SO THE OTHERS MINGLED WITH THE CROWD AND IT WAS HE WHO SAID TO HER
THEN ROBERT WRIGGLED OUT FROM UNDER THE STALL WITH SOME BENARES BRASS AND SOME INLAID SANDALWOOD BOXES LIBERTY CRIED MISS PEASMARSH THEN CHARLES HAS NOT FORGOTTEN AFTER ALL
CYRIL'S STORIES HAD TAKEN SOME TIME SO HAD THE MEAL OF STRANGE SWEET FOODS THAT THEY HAD HAD WHILE THE LITTLE PRETTY THINGS WERE BEING BOUGHT AND THE GAS IN THE SCHOOLROOM WAS ALREADY LIGHTED
SHE CALLED SEPTIMUS BECAUSE AT THAT VERY MOMENT SHE SAW HER NEPHEW COMING IN AT THE GATE IN ANOTHER MINUTE HE HAD LET HIMSELF IN WITH HIS LATCH KEY AND HAD MOUNTED THE STAIRS AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM JANE AND ROBERT EACH UTTERED A SHRIEK OF JOY SO LOUD AND SO SUDDEN
MAKING A KNOT AT THE END OF A NEEDLEFUL OF SCOTCH HEATHER MIXTURE FINGERING WOOL WHICH IS VERY WRONG AND YOU MUST NEVER DO IT WHEN YOU ARE DARNING
CRIED MISSUS BIDDLE AND HER VOICE SHOOK WITH ANGRINESS YOU DO LOOK HORRID SAID JANE SUDDENLY MISSUS BIDDLE ACTUALLY STAMPED THAT BOOTED FOOT OF HERS
BUT EVERY ONE WAS AGREED THAT IF THEY APPEARED SUDDENLY IN BOURNEMOUTH IT WOULD FRIGHTEN MOTHER OUT OF HER WITS IF NOT INTO A FIT SO THEY SAT ON THE CARPET AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL THEY ALMOST BEGAN TO SQUINT LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL I KNOW
I'VE READ ABOUT FIRES IN PAPERS I'M SURE IT'S ALL RIGHT LET'S WAIT HERE AS FATHER SAID WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE SAID ANTHEA BITTERLY LOOK HERE SAID ROBERT I'M NOT FRIGHTENED NO I'M NOT
IF IT'S A DREAM SAID ROBERT YOU WILL WAKE UP DIRECTLY AND THEN YOU'D BE SORRY IF YOU'D SENT US INTO A DREAM ASYLUM BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NEVER GET INTO THE SAME DREAM AGAIN AND LET US OUT AND SO WE MIGHT STAY THERE FOR EVER AND THEN WHAT ABOUT OUR SORROWING RELATIVES WHO AREN'T IN THE DREAMS AT ALL
WHAT I MUST TELL YOU IS THAT THOUGH CYRIL AND JANE AND ROBERT AND ANTHEA ENJOYED IT AS MUCH AS ANY CHILDREN POSSIBLY COULD THE PLEASURE OF THE PHOENIX WAS FAR FAR GREATER THAN THEIRS
WHICH COOK GAVE HER ON DIRTY BITS OF PAPER AND WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WAS THAT COOK HAD ONLY FIVEPENCE HALF PENNY AND A LOT OF UNPAID BILLS LEFT OUT OF ALL THE MONEY MOTHER HAD SENT HER FOR HOUSE KEEPING
AND INDEED THE CROWD ROUND THE DOORS LOOKED AS THICK AS FLIES IN THE JAM MAKING SEASON I WISH WE'D NEVER SEEN THE PHOENIX CRIED JANE EVEN AT THAT AWFUL MOMENT
ONLY DO WASH YOUR FACE FIRST MOTHER WILL BE SURE TO THINK YOU ARE BURNT TO A CINDER IF SHE SEES YOU AS BLACK AS THAT AND SHE'LL FAINT OR BE ILL OR SOMETHING OH I WISH WE'D NEVER GOT TO KNOW THAT PHOENIX
SO THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID CYRIL TAKING UP HIS NEEDLE AND INSTANTLY PRICKING HIS HAND IN A NEW PLACE OF COURSE I KNOW THAT WHAT YOU HAVE REALLY WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS TIME IS NOT WHAT ANTHEA AND CYRIL DID
FOUR LONG BREATHS OF DEEP RELIEF WERE INSTANTLY BREATHED THE DRAUGHT WHICH THEY HAD NEVER LIKED BEFORE WAS FOR THE MOMENT QUITE PLEASANT AND THEY WERE SAFE AND EVERY ONE ELSE WAS SAFE
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES ADIEU AND WAVING A CHEERY FAREWELL WITH HIS NEAT UMBRELLA THE GOOD AND HIGH HATTED UNCLE PASSED AWAY LEAVING CYRIL AND ANTHEA TO EXCHANGE ELOQUENT GLANCES OVER THE SHINING GOLDEN SOVEREIGN THAT LAY IN CYRIL'S HAND WELL SAID ANTHEA
THE REVEREND SEPTIMUS PASSED HIS HAND WEARILY OVER HIS BROW I FEEL A LITTLE FAINT HE SAID RUNNING UPSTAIRS SO QUICKLY WE NEVER TOUCHED THE BEASTLY BOX SAID ROBERT THEN YOUR CONFEDERATES DID SAID MISS SELINA NO NO SAID THE CURATE HASTILY
BUT WE LIKE THEM TO KNOW IT UNLESS WE ARE THE VERY BEST AND NOBLEST KIND OF PEOPLE AND ROBERT WAS JUST ORDINARY
THE TWO CHILDREN SUDDENLY FELT THAT EXTRAORDINARY SHRINKING FEELING THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE WHEN YOU ARE JUST GOING TO VANISH AND THE NEXT MOMENT THEY HAD VANISHED AND THE REVEREND SEPTIMUS WAS LEFT ALONE WITH HIS AUNTS I KNEW IT WAS A DREAM HE CRIED WILDLY I'VE HAD SOMETHING LIKE IT BEFORE
BUT MOTHER SAID ANTHEA WHEN MOTHER PUT DOWN THE PEN TO LICK AN ENVELOPE THE CARPET TAKES US WHEREVER WE LIKE AND I WISH IT WOULD TAKE YOU WHERE YOU COULD GET A FEW NICE EASTERN THINGS FOR MY BAZAAR SAID MOTHER
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES LOOKING DOWN INTO AN ATTIC WHICH WAS ALSO A LUMBER ROOM IT HAD BOXES AND BROKEN CHAIRS OLD FENDERS AND PICTURE FRAMES AND RAG BAGS HANGING FROM NAILS
AND AS THEY WENT AWAY THEY HEARD THE CURATE SAY
BUT IT'S TRUE SAID ANTHEA DESPERATELY YOU SHOULDN'T SAY THAT MY SWEET SAID MOTHER GENTLY AND THEN ANTHEA KNEW IT WAS HOPELESS ARE YOU GOING AWAY FOR LONG ASKED ANTHEA I'VE GOT A COLD SAID MOTHER
TWENTY TWO AND NINEPENCE IT OUGHT TO HAVE LASTED FOR YEARS IT'S SIMPLY DREADFUL NOW WELL NEVER MIND DARLINGS YOU'VE DONE YOUR BEST I THINK WE'LL HAVE COCONUT MATTING NEXT TIME
LET'S WISH OURSELVES HOME SAID CYRIL IN A WHISPER NO GO ROBERT WHISPERED BACK SHE'D BE THERE TOO AND RAVING MAD AS LIKELY AS NOT HORRID THING I HATE HER
THE CARPET TOOK US TO A PLACE WHERE YOU COULDN'T HAVE WHOOPING COUGH
CRIED THE LAMB IT WAS A DELICIOUS MOMENT EVEN THE BOYS THUMPED THEIR BABY BROTHER JOYOUSLY ON THE BACK THEN ANTHEA GLANCED AT MOTHER
THEN SHE SMILED QUITE A JOLLY SMILE WHY SO I AM SHE SAID WHAT A FUNNY IDEA WHY SHOULDN'T I BE IN A GOOD TEMPER MY DEARS ONCE MORE THE CARPET HAD DONE ITS WORK AND NOT ON MISSUS BIDDLE ALONE
PEOPLE WHISPERED THEN PEOPLE SHRIEKED FIRE FIRE THE CURTAIN WENT DOWN THE LIGHTS WENT UP FIRE CRIED EVERY ONE AND MADE FOR THE DOORS
WELL NOW YOU HAVE DONE IT SAID ROBERT BUT ANTHEA WAS A REALLY FIRST CLASS SISTER SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD TILL SHE HAD GOT OUT THE SCOTCH HEATHER MIXTURE FINGERING WOOL
THERE IS A SOCIETY CALLED THAT SAID CYRIL WHERE IS IT AND WHAT IS A SOCIETY ASKED THE BIRD IT'S A SORT OF JOINED TOGETHER LOT OF PEOPLE A SORT OF BROTHERHOOD A KIND OF WELL
AH DO SAY YOU WILL AND JANE RAN BACK AND SAID BEFORE ANTHEA COULD DRAG HER AWAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER EASTER MISS PEASMARSH SMILED AND LOOKED VERY PRETTY INDEED AND THE CURATE SAID
MOTHER DEAR SAID ANTHEA YES LOVE A DUCK SAID MOTHER ABOUT COOK SAID ANTHEA I KNOW WHERE SHE IS DO YOU DEAR SAID MOTHER
BOUGHT SUCH A BAD BARGAIN AS THAT CARPET A SOFT OH
THAT YOU ARE NOT TO PLAY WITH PARAFFIN WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING WE HAVE BURNT A PARAFFINY RAG ANTHEA ANSWERED IT WAS NO USE TELLING MOTHER WHAT THEY HAD DONE TO THE CARPET
BUT OH HE HAS A DREADFUL HABIT OF PADDLING OUT AMONG THE ROCKS AND SOAKING BOTH HIS BUNNY SOCKS I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE ABOUT THE SONS OF THE PHOENIX REALLY SAID ROBERT
ON THE GENUINE LEG REMAINING TO HIM JOHN ROKESMITH'S MANNER TOWARDS MISSUS BOFFIN AT THIS TIME WAS MORE THE MANNER OF A YOUNG MAN TOWARDS A MOTHER THAN THAT OF A SECRETARY TOWARDS HIS EMPLOYER'S WIFE
BUT THERE WERE BELLS TO WINDWARD THAT TOLD THEM OF ITS BEING ONE TWO THREE WITHOUT THAT AID THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN HOW THE NIGHT WORE BY THE FALLING OF THE TIDE RECORDED IN THE APPEARANCE OF AN EVER WIDENING BLACK WET STRIP OF SHORE
BUT HERE COLLAPSES AND DOES NOT COMPLETELY RECOVER UNTIL DINNER IS OVER AND THE ANALYTICAL HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO WITHDRAW WE NOW COME SAYS VENEERING TO THE POINT THE REAL POINT OF OUR LITTLE FAMILY CONSULTATION SOPHRONIA
ARE YOU ANYWHERE HERE FLEDGEBY TO WHICH FLEDGEBY AFTER CAUTIONING RIAH IN A LOW VOICE TO TAKE HIS CUE AS IT SHOULD BE GIVEN HIM REPLIED HERE I AM AND OPENED HIS BEDROOM DOOR COME IN SAID FLEDGEBY
THE MATURE YOUNG LADY IN THE LIGHT OF A SISTER AND ALFRED LAMMLE THE MATURE YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN THE LIGHT OF A BROTHER TWEMLOW HAS ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WENT TO SCHOOL AS A JUNIOR WITH ALFRED HE HAS ANSWERED NOT EXACTLY WHETHER SOPHRONIA WAS ADOPTED BY HIS MOTHER
WHICH I CHERISH NEXT TO MY LIFE BEING PRESENT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A MORE AGREEABLE PROCEEDING TO THE ASSISTING BYSTANDERS THAT IS TO SAY LIME BURNERS I ALSO SAID LIGHTWOOD PUSHING HIS FRIEND ASIDE WITH A LAUGH SHOULD MUCH PREFER THAT
AWARE OF HER ENEMY LADY TIPPINS TRIES A YOUTHFUL SALLY OR TWO AND TRIES THE EYE GLASS BUT FROM THE IMPENETRABLE CAP AND SNORTING ARMOUR OF THE STONEY AUNT ALL WEAPONS REBOUND POWERLESS ANOTHER OBJECTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IS
AND DRAWING HER ARM THROUGH BELLA'S AND NODDY YOU SIT HERE AND MISTER ROKESMITH YOU SIT THERE NOW YOU SEE WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THIS MISTER AND MISSUS MILVEY HAVE SENT ME THE KINDEST NOTE POSSIBLE
YOU HAVE LOVED CHILDREN WELL MISTER BOFFIN HAS TOLD ME NOT A BIT BETTER THAN HE HAS BUT THAT'S HIS WAY HE PUTS ALL THE GOOD UPON ME YOU SPEAK RATHER SADLY MISTER ROKESMITH DO I
IT'S NO GOOD THIS SORT OF GAME YOU KNOW YOU MUST COME UP I MEAN TO HAVE YOU THERE WAS SO MUCH VIRTUE IN THIS DISTINCTLY AND DECIDEDLY MEANING TO HAVE IT THAT IT YIELDED A LITTLE EVEN WHILE THE LINE WAS PLAYED I TOLD YOU SO QUOTH MISTER INSPECTOR PULLING OFF HIS OUTER COAT
EUGENE WITH A LESS WEIGHTY SENSE OF PERSONAL TROUBLE ON HIM THAN HE USUALLY HAD WOULD GO OUT WITH MISTER INSPECTOR NOTE THE SPOT AND COME BACK ON THE SHELVING BANK OF THE RIVER AMONG THE SLIMY STONES OF A CAUSEWAY
AH WITH ANOTHER ROLL OF HIS EYES AS TO WHAT WAS FOUND IN THE DUST NOW
I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW HOW THE POINT OF LAW MAY STAND BUT I'M THOROUGHLY CONFIDENT UPON THE POINT OF FACT
MISTER BOFFIN WISHES YOU TO KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT EXPECT YOU TO STAY AT HOME ANY EVENING ON THE CHANCE OF HIS COMING IT HAS OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MAY WITHOUT INTENDING IT HAVE BEEN A TIE UPON YOU IN FUTURE IF HE SHOULD COME WITHOUT NOTICE HE WILL TAKE HIS CHANCE OF FINDING YOU
OF THIS COMMISSION THE BARE ARMED BOB LEADING THE WAY WITH A FLAMING WISP OF PAPER SO SPEEDILY ACQUITTED HIMSELF THAT COSY SEEMED TO LEAP OUT OF A DARK SLEEP AND EMBRACE THEM WARMLY THE MOMENT THEY PASSED THE LINTELS OF ITS HOSPITABLE DOOR
NEXT TIME WITH A VIEW TO OUR PEACE OF MIND WE'LL COMMIT THE CRIME INSTEAD OF TAKING THE CRIMINAL YOU SWEAR IT CERTAINLY SWORN LET TIPPINS LOOK TO IT HER LIFE'S IN DANGER
NOT HOWEVER THAT HE HAS THE LEAST NOTION OF ITS BEING HIS OWN CASE OUR FRIENDS ALFRED AND SOPHRONIA PURSUES VENEERING THE VEILED PROPHET OUR FRIENDS ALFRED AND SOPHRONIA
HE WAS ROUSED BY MISTER FLEDGEBY'S APPEARING ERECT AT THE FOOT OF THE BED IN TURKISH SLIPPERS ROSE COLOURED TURKISH TROUSERS GOT CHEAP FROM SOMEBODY WHO HAD CHEATED SOME OTHER SOMEBODY OUT OF THEM AND A GOWN AND CAP TO CORRESPOND
THRICE HE REPEATED THESE ACTIONS BEFORE HIS LISTENING EARS WERE GREETED BY THE VOICE OF FLEDGEBY CALLING FROM HIS BED HOLD YOUR ROW I'LL COME AND OPEN THE DOOR DIRECTLY
THE UNFOLDED CLOTHES HORSE DISPLAYED A CHOICE COLLECTION OF HALFPENNY BALLADS AND BECAME A SCREEN AND THE STOOL PLANTED WITHIN IT BECAME HIS POST FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ALL WEATHERS SAW THE MAN AT THE POST
IT'S A GOODISH STRETCH SIR I COME UP IN A CAB AND THE CAB'S WAITING TO BE PAID WE COULD GO BACK IN IT BEFORE YOU PAID IT IF YOU LIKED
VENEERING WITH GREAT CONTEMPT AND WHAT DOES VENEERING KNOW ABOUT ME WAS HE NOT YOUR TRUSTEE NO I HAVE NO TRUSTEE BUT THE ONE YOU SAW ON THE DAY WHEN YOU FRAUDULENTLY MARRIED ME
HAD FURNISHED HIM WITH A HATBAND OF WHOLESALE CAPACITY WHICH WAS FLUTED BEHIND FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HAT TO THE BRIM AND TERMINATED IN A BLACK BUNCH FROM WHICH THE IMAGINATION SHRUNK DISCOMFITED AND THE REASON REVOLTED
THAT IS TO SAY REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF TRUE BRITISH OAK FOR SUCH YOU ARE EXPLAIN MISTER VENUS THE EXPRESSION PAPERS SEEING THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS GENERALLY CUTTING OFF SOME NEAR RELATION OR BLOCKING OUT SOME NATURAL AFFECTION MISTER VENUS REJOINS
AND LISTENING TO THE LECTURE RECENTLY CONCLUDED AND HAVING TO DINE IN THE TEMPLE WITH AN UNKNOWN MAN WHO DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS M H F EUGENE GAFFER HARMON AND SAID HE LIVED AT HAILSTORM
HAS BUT AN INDIGESTIBLE APPEARANCE HOWEVER ALL THE THINGS INDISPENSABLE TO BE SAID ARE SAID
RIAH OBEYED AND THEN TAKING A BAG FROM HIS BREAST AND REFERRING TO THE SUM IN THE ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH THEY MADE HIM RESPONSIBLE TOLD IT OUT UPON THE TABLE FLEDGEBY TOLD IT AGAIN WITH GREAT CARE AND RANG EVERY SOVEREIGN
MISTER INSPECTOR HAVING PROPOSED AS AN APPROPRIATE SENTIMENT THE LIME TRADE AND BOB WITHDREW TO REPORT THE COMMENDATIONS OF THE GUESTS TO MISS ABBEY IN THE BAR
IT WAS FAINTER AND DULLER PERHAPS FIRE LIKE THE HIGHER ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE LIFE IT HELPS TO SUSTAIN HAS ITS GREATEST TENDENCY TOWARDS DEATH WHEN THE NIGHT IS DYING AND THE DAY IS NOT YET BORN
I SUPPOSE HE SAID TAKING ONE UP TO EYE IT CLOSELY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN LIGHTENING ANY OF THESE BUT IT'S A TRADE OF YOUR PEOPLE'S YOU KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT SWEATING A POUND MEANS DON'T YOU
MISTER BOFFIN DREW A LONG BREATH LAID DOWN HIS PEN LOOKED AT HIS NOTES AS DOUBTING WHETHER HE HAD THE PLEASURE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AND APPEARED ON A SECOND PERUSAL OF THEIR COUNTENANCES TO BE CONFIRMED IN HIS IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD NOT
THE VOUCHERS WERE PRODUCED AND FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR MISTER FLEDGEBY CONCENTRATED HIS SUBLIME ATTENTION ON THEM THEY AND THE ACCOUNTS WERE ALL FOUND CORRECT AND THE BOOKS AND THE PAPERS RESUMED THEIR PLACES IN THE BAG
HE OBSERVES WITH A VAGUELY PIOUS AIR WAS SURELY NEVER MEANT FOR NOTHING LASTLY HE RETURNS TO THE CAUSE OF THE RIGHT GLOOMILY FORESHADOWING THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING BEING UNEARTHED TO CRIMINATE MISTER BOFFIN
THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM TALK AND LAUGH APART AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THEIR MANNER AND THE BUFFERS WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE DISHES WITH SYSTEMATIC PERSEVERANCE
OVER THE HOUSE ITSELF HE EXERCISED THE SAME IMAGINARY POWER AS OVER ITS INHABITANTS AND THEIR AFFAIRS HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN IT THE LENGTH OF A PIECE OF FAT
IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO BE FOUND ON THESE PREMISES LET US FIND IT TOGETHER LET US MAKE THE FRIENDLY MOVE OF AGREEING TO LOOK FOR IT TOGETHER LET US MAKE THE FRIENDLY MOVE OF AGREEING TO SHARE THE PROFITS OF IT EQUALLY BETWIXT US IN THE CAUSE OF THE RIGHT THUS SILAS ASSUMING A NOBLE AIR
BOTHER JUSTICE SAID FLEDGEBY NOT IN GENEROSITY JEWS AND GENEROSITY SAID FLEDGEBY THAT'S A GOOD CONNEXION BRING OUT YOUR VOUCHERS AND DON'T TALK JERUSALEM PALAVER
HE IS AT HER SIDE AGAIN IN A PACE OR TWO AND HE RETORTS THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU SAID YOU SAID DISINGENUOUSNESS WHAT IF I DID THERE IS NO IF IN THE CASE YOU DID I DID THEN AND WHAT OF IT
UNDER ONE OF THESE LATTER EUGENE'S COMPANION DISAPPEARED
AND HE MUTTERS SOMETHING BUT CHECKS HIMSELF QUESTION FOR QUESTION IT IS MY TURN AGAIN MISSUS LAMMLE WHAT MADE YOU SUPPOSE ME A MAN OF PROPERTY YOU MADE ME SUPPOSE YOU SO
THERE MAY TURN OUT TO BE SOMETHING CONSIDERABLE FOR HIM THAT COMES IN SECOND AND I DON'T MENTION WHO MAY OR WHO MAY NOT TRY FOR THAT PLACE
IF WEGG HAD BEEN WORSE PAID FOR HIS OFFICE OR BETTER QUALIFIED TO DISCHARGE IT
UNITED IN THE BONDS OF MATRIMONY ALFRED LAMMLE ESQUIRE OF SACKVILLE STREET PICCADILLY TO SOPHRONIA ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE LATE HORATIO AKERSHEM ESQUIRE OF YORKSHIRE ALSO HOW THE FAIR BRIDE WAS MARRIED FROM THE HOUSE OF HAMILTON VENEERING
AS HE HAD MANY A TIME LOOKED DOWN ON MANY ANOTHER MAN THE WAY OF IT WAS THIS OF COURSE YOU GENTLEMEN HARDLY FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT HE WAS TOWING BY THE NECK AND ARMS THEY HAD HELPED TO RELEASE THE ROPE AND OF COURSE NOT
FOOL THAT HE HAD BEEN NOT TO HAVE SEEN THAT BEFORE AND YET WOULD IT HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
WHERE WAS THIS CRIME CLUB THEY HAD BEEN AS NEARLY AS HE COULD ESTIMATE TWO HOURS IN MAKING THE JOURNEY
HE LEANED BACK AND SURVEYED JIMMIE DALE CRITICALLY WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK EYES AH QUITE SO HE OBSERVED THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE MASK BUT I AM STILL A LITTLE IN THE DARK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THEY HAD STRUCK QUICKLY THESE INGENIOUS DRESS SUITED MURDERERS OF THE CRIME CLUB THE HOUSE WAS ALREADY WATCHED WOULD BE WATCHED NOW UNTIRINGLY UNCEASINGLY NOT A MOVEMENT OF HIS HENCEFORTH BUT WOULD BE UNDER THEIR EYES
THEN SAY GOOD NIGHT HE REMOVED HIS HAND FROM THE MOUTHPIECE IT'S QUITE USELESS MA'AM SAID JASON APOLOGETICALLY IN THE RARE TEMPER HE WAS IN HE WOULDN'T COME TO USE HIS OWN WORDS MA'AM NOT FOR THE QUEEN OF SHEBA HERSELF MA'AM
YES YES WHAT DID SHE SAY QUICK MAN GOOD LORD MASTER JIM FALTERED JASON I SHE JASON SAID JIMMIE DALE SUDDENLY AS COLD AS ICE WHAT DID SHE SAY THINK MAN EVERY WORD
WITH A SUPREME EFFORT JIMMIE DALE STROVE TO RALLY HIS TOTTERING SENSES DID THEY NOT UNDERSTAND THE STUPENDOUS MOCKERY OF THEIR QUESTIONS DID THEY NOT UNDERSTAND THAT HE DID NOT KNOW HE HAD TOLD THEM SO PERHAPS
HE WOULD LOOK THERE FIRST AFTERWARD HE WOULD WAKEN JASON HE GAINED THE DOOR OF HIS DEN ON THE FIRST LANDING
OF THE SECRET SERVICE HAD FINALLY ADMITTED DEFEAT AND A SHADOW NO LONGER SKULKED DAY AND NIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE SANCTUARY AND LARRY THE BAT BORE THE GOVERNMENT INDORSEMENT SO TO SPEAK OF BEING NO MORE SUSPICIOUS A CHARACTER
JASON VENTURED ANXIOUSLY JASON SAID JIMMIE DALE SWITCH OFF THE LIGHT AND GO TO THE FRONT WINDOW AND LOOK OUT KEEP WELL BEHIND THE CURTAINS DON'T SHOW YOURSELF TELL ME IF YOU SEE ANYTHING YES SIR SAID JASON OBEDIENTLY THE LIGHT WENT OUT
YES SIR SAID JASON MECHANICALLY HOW LONG AGO WAS IT SINCE SHE TELEPHONED LAST ASKED JIMMIE DALE QUICKLY WELL SIR I COULDN'T RIGHTLY SAY YOU SEE AS I SAID MASTER JIM I MUST HAVE GONE TO SLEEP BUT
JIMMIE DALE DEMANDED SHARPLY WELL SIR SAID JASON
THAN THAT OF A DISREPUTABLE BUT HARMLESS DOPE FIEND OF THE UNDERWORLD LARRY THE BAT THE GRAY SEAL JIMMIE DALE THE MILLIONAIRE
THE ONE THEY HAD TAKEN FROM HIM AFTER THE ACCIDENT JIMMIE DALE PICKED IT UP EXAMINED IT AND SMILED A LITTLE SARCASTICALLY
IF YOU SO CHOOSE TO CONSIDER IT YOUR REFUSAL MAY BE THE ACT OF A BRAVE MAN
HE HAD BETTER TELL THEM SO AGAIN I HE TRIED TO SPEAK AND FOUND THE WORDS THICK UPON HIS TONGUE I DO NOT KNOW THE GLASS ITSELF WAS THRUST ABRUPTLY BETWEEN HIS LIPS
AS A LOGICAL CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM AT HIS HOME THOSE WIRES WHERE DID THEY LEAD TO NOT FAR AWAY THAT WOULD BE ALMOST A MECHANICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
GAVE ON THE DRIVEWAY AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE THAT LED TO THE GARAGE IN THE REAR CAUTIOUSLY NOW FOR THE CEMENT FLOORING WAS IN THE STILLNESS LITTLE LESS THAN A SOUNDING BOARD JIMMIE DALE REACHED THE WALL
HE HAD HAD NEITHER TIME NOR OPPORTUNITY TO THINK BEFORE
HE WAS APPARENTLY THE APPARENTLY WAS A MENTAL RESERVATION QUITE ALONE IN THE ROOM HE GOT UP FROM THE COUCH AND WALKED SHAKILY ACROSS THE FLOOR TO THE DESK A REVOLVER LAY INVITINGLY UPON THE BLOTTING PAD IT WAS HIS OWN
COULD SHE SUPPLY THE LINKS THAT WOULD FORGE THE CHAIN INTO AN UNBROKEN WHOLE AND THEN FOR THE SECOND TIME THE CAR SLOWED DOWN AND THIS TIME THE MAN ON THE SEAT BESIDE JIMMIE DALE REACHED UP AND UNTIED THE SCARF
HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE STRENUOUS MONTHS AND WEEKS JUST PAST THE STORM RAISED BY THE NEWSPAPERS AT THE THEFT OF OLD LUDDY'S DIAMONDS HAD SUBSIDED INTO SPORADIC DIATRIBES AIMED AT THE POLICE KLINE
TO GET BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOME LIFE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES MISSUS MOYNE WAS GENUINELY PLEASED AND GRATEFUL
SINCE THE WINDOW CURTAINS OF THE CAR WERE TIGHTLY DRAWN
THERE COULD BE NO TRUCE NO ARMISTICE
SAID JIMMIE DALE SLOWLY I HAVEN'T COUNTED IT YOUR BANK WAS ROBBED THIS EVENING AT CLOSING TIME I UNDERSTAND YES CARLING'S VOICE WAS EXCITED NOW
JASON LIFTED THE RECEIVER FROM THE HOOK YES HELLO HE SAID YES MA'AM MISTER DALE HAS COME IN BUT HE HAS RETIRED YES I TOLD HIM BUT BEGGING YOUR PARDON MA'AM
I AM NO MORE ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THAN YOU ARE YOURSELVES I NEVER SAW THAT MAN IN THE CHAIR THERE IN MY LIFE UNTIL THE MOMENT THAT I HAILED HIM IN HIS CAB TO NIGHT I DO NOT KNOW WHO THE WOMAN IS TO WHOM THAT RING BELONGS
IN A SUBURBAN TOWN ON A COUNTRY ROAD IT SEEMED CHILDISHLY ABSURD THAT HE COULD NOT AT LEAST DIFFERENTIATE TO THAT EXTENT AND YET FROM THE MOMENT HE HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE AUTOMOBILE IN WHICH HE NOW FOUND HIMSELF HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT HE COULD NOT TELL
THAT SHE HAD EVER CALLED UPON HIM TO UNDERTAKE
BASED ON A SUPPOSITION WHICH MIGHT AFTER ALL BE WRONG AND BEING WRONG MEANT DEATH BUT IT WAS NOT SUPPOSITION EITHER HE WAS RIGHT NOW OR THESE MEN WERE CHILDISH IMMATURE FOOLS AND WHATEVER ELSE THEY MIGHT BE
HAD EITHER BEEN KILLED OUTRIGHT IN THE AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT
THAT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO TRAFFIC BUT THEN IT MUST BE ONE OR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT THAT HOUR THE CITY STREETS CERTAINLY THOSE THAT WOULD BE CHOSEN BY THESE MEN WOULD BE QUITE AS DESERTED AS ANY COUNTRY ROAD AND AS FOR A SENSE OF DIRECTION
IT COULD BE ONLY SPECULATION HE HAD DECIDED THAT ONCE BEFORE THE MAN AT HIS SIDE FELT AGAIN OVER THE SCARF TO SEE THAT IT WAS IN PLACE
WHOSE CENTRE WAS THE CORNER ON WHICH HE NOW STOOD AND WHOSE RADIUS WAS FORTY MILES OR FORTY YARDS HE FORCED A LAUGH IT WAS JUST THAT NO MORE NO LESS
AND WHAT MUST BE AN OBVIOUS FACT TO HER THAT THEIR PLANS HAD MISCARRIED THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM AS JIMMIE DALE SHE WOULD EXPECT HIM COUNT ON HIM TO MAKE THAT MOVE
WAS THE GAME ALL EVERYTHING SHE HERSELF AT THEIR MERCY ALREADY IF SHE HAD TELEPHONED
THERE IS ONE WHO IS NOT ALIVE AS YOU HAVE SEEN THAT MAN WE KNEW WITH YOU IT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT YOUR PRESENCE IN THE TAXICAB WAS ONLY SUSPICIOUS THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE
HE WAS STANDING ON A CORNER ON RIVERSIDE DRIVE WITHIN A FEW DOORS OF HIS OWN HOUSE
AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HIS ARMS AND WRISTS WERE CAUGHT IN A POWERFUL GRASP BY THE TWO MEN IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HIM WHO ALL ALONG HAD ENACTED THE ROLE OF GUARDS AGAIN THE LEADER SPOKE I WILL REPEAT THE QUESTIONS HE SAID SHARPLY
MONEY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AGAIN A LITTLE GRIMLY THIS TIME
FOR THEIR MONSTROUS PURPOSES AND THEN JIMMIE DALE IN THE DARKNESS SMILED AGAIN GRIMLY AS THE LEADER'S REFERENCE TO THE GRAY SEAL RECURRED TO HIM WELL PERHAPS WHO KNEW THEY WOULD HAVE REASON MORE THAN THEY DREAMED OF TO WISH THE GRAY SEAL ENROLLED IN THEIR OWN RANKS
A PRONOUNCEMENT UPON HIMSELF THAT MIGHT MEAN LIFE OR DEATH HE HURRIED ON PEOPLE STILL PASSED BY HIM TOO MANY AND THEN A CAFE JUST AHEAD
AND FELL WITH A SHARP ACRID BURNING SENSATION UPON JIMMIE DALE'S TONGUE FOR A MOMENT JIMMIE DALE'S ANIMATION MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SEEMED SWEPT AWAY FROM HIM IN AS IT WERE A HIATUS OF HIDEOUS SUSPENSE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WAS AS FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED ENDED FINISHED AND DONE WITH TIME PASSED A VERY LONG TIME AS HE SAT THERE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN HOUR HE COULD ONLY HAZARD A GUESS NOT ONE OF THE MEN IN THE CAR HAD SPOKEN A WORD
AND WHO ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WILL NOT REQUIRE A FUTURE ESTABLISHMENT BY LAW THIS POSITION WILL HARDLY BE CONTESTED THE LAST OF THESE TWO CLAUSES IT IS EQUALLY CLEAR
OR WHY IS IT SUGGESTED THAT THREE OR FOUR CONFEDERACIES WOULD BE BETTER THAN ONE I AM PERSUADED IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT RIGHT ON THIS SUBJECT AND THAT THEIR UNIVERSAL AND UNIFORM ATTACHMENT TO THE CAUSE OF THE UNION
BY ANY IMPRESSIONS OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE EVIDENCE OF TRUTH YOU WILL NO DOUBT AT THE SAME TIME HAVE COLLECTED FROM THE GENERAL SCOPE OF THEM THAT THEY PROCEED FROM A SOURCE NOT UNFRIENDLY TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION
THAT ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ABLE AT MUCH LESS EXPENSE TO EXTEND THE DUTIES ON IMPORTS BEYOND COMPARISON FURTHER THAN WOULD BE PRACTICABLE TO THE STATES SEPARATELY OR TO ANY PARTIAL CONFEDERACIES
IF BY DISUNION THE STATES SHOULD BE PLACED IN A SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER RESEMBLING THAT OF FRANCE WITH RESPECT TO HER NEIGHBORS THE ARBITRARY AND VEXATIOUS POWERS
THE MODE OF APPOINTMENT OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALMOST THE ONLY PART OF THE SYSTEM OF ANY CONSEQUENCE WHICH HAS ESCAPED WITHOUT SEVERE CENSURE OR WHICH HAS RECEIVED THE SLIGHTEST MARK OF APPROBATION FROM ITS OPPONENTS
THE HONEST ERRORS OF MINDS LED ASTRAY BY PRECONCEIVED JEALOUSIES AND FEARS SO NUMEROUS INDEED AND SO POWERFUL ARE THE CAUSES WHICH SERVE TO GIVE A FALSE BIAS TO THE JUDGMENT THAT WE UPON MANY OCCASIONS
UNABLE BY ITS OWN AUTHORITY TO LAY HOLD OF FRESH RESOURCES AND URGED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF NATIONAL DANGER WOULD IT NOT BE DRIVEN TO THE EXPEDIENT OF DIVERTING THE FUNDS ALREADY APPROPRIATED FROM THEIR PROPER OBJECTS TO THE DEFENSE OF THE STATE
AND I WILL FREELY LAY BEFORE YOU THE REASONS ON WHICH THEY ARE FOUNDED THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GOOD INTENTIONS DISDAINS AMBIGUITY I SHALL NOT HOWEVER MULTIPLY PROFESSIONS ON THIS HEAD MY MOTIVES MUST REMAIN IN THE DEPOSITORY OF MY OWN BREAST
THIS IS THE PLAIN ALTERNATIVE INVOLVED BY THOSE WHO WISH TO DENY IT THE POWER OF EXTENDING ITS OPERATIONS TO INDIVIDUALS SUCH A SCHEME IF PRACTICABLE AT ALL WOULD INSTANTLY DEGENERATE INTO A MILITARY DESPOTISM BUT IT WILL BE FOUND IN EVERY LIGHT
AND HAS BEEN AMPLY UNFOLDED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THESE INQUIRIES IT IS THIS WHICH HAS CHIEFLY CONTRIBUTED TO REDUCE US TO A SITUATION WHICH AFFORDS AMPLE CAUSE BOTH OF MORTIFICATION TO OURSELVES
THE SECOND CHARGE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS THAT IT WILL BE TOO SMALL TO POSSESS A DUE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERESTS OF ITS CONSTITUENTS
THAT THE ACTIVE WEALTH OF KING'S COUNTY BEARS A MUCH GREATER PROPORTION TO THAT OF MONTGOMERY THAN IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE IF WE SHOULD TAKE EITHER THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE LANDS OR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE AS A CRITERION THE WEALTH OF NATIONS DEPENDS UPON AN INFINITE VARIETY OF CAUSES
WE TAKE INTO VIEW THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO MUST NECESSARILY BE EMPLOYED TO GUARD THE INLAND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CONFEDERACIES AGAINST ILLICIT TRADE AND WHO IN TIME WILL INFALLIBLY SPRING UP OUT OF THE NECESSITIES OF REVENUE AND IF
AND ACTING UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES FAVORABLE TO DELIBERATION AND TO A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF ALL THE REASONS AND INDUCEMENTS WHICH WERE PROPER TO GOVERN THEIR CHOICE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS
EMPOWERS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO NOMINATE AND BY AND WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE TO APPOINT AMBASSADORS OTHER PUBLIC MINISTERS AND CONSULS JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT
IN ADDITION TO THE ESTABLISHMENTS WHICH ALL PARTIES WILL ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE NECESSARY WE COULD NOT REASONABLY FLATTER OURSELVES THAT THIS RESOURCE ALONE UPON THE MOST IMPROVED SCALE WOULD EVEN SUFFICE FOR ITS PRESENT NECESSITIES
AND WOULD SUBJECT THEM ENTIRELY TO THE MERCY OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE AS THE LAWS OF THE UNION ARE TO BECOME THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND AS IT IS TO HAVE POWER TO PASS ALL LAWS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE AUTHORITIES WITH WHICH IT IS PROPOSED TO VEST IT
AND TO KEEP AGENTS FOR HIS PARTICULAR AFFAIRS AT FOREIGN COURTS IN HIS MILITARY CAPACITY HE COMMANDS THE FEDERAL TROOPS PROVIDES FOR GARRISONS AND IN GENERAL REGULATES MILITARY AFFAIRS DISPOSES OF ALL APPOINTMENTS FROM COLONELS TO ENSIGNS
INGENIOUS MEN MAY DECLAIM WITH PLAUSIBILITY ON ANY SUBJECT BUT NO HUMAN INGENUITY CAN POINT OUT ANY OTHER EXPEDIENT TO RESCUE US FROM THE INCONVENIENCES AND EMBARRASSMENTS NATURALLY RESULTING FROM DEFECTIVE SUPPLIES OF THE PUBLIC TREASURY
WHICH THE MAGNITUDE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT DEMAND AND WHICH IT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO RECEIVE BUT THIS AS WAS REMARKED IN THE FOREGOING NUMBER OF THIS PAPER IS MORE TO BE WISHED THAN EXPECTED THAT IT MAY BE SO CONSIDERED AND EXAMINED
AND WHEN THE PROGRESS OF HOSTILITY AND DESOLATION LEFT LITTLE ROOM FOR THOSE CALM AND MATURE INQUIRIES AND REFLECTIONS WHICH MUST EVER PRECEDE THE FORMATION OF A WISE AND WELL BALANCED GOVERNMENT FOR A FREE PEOPLE
ARE LESS CAPABLE OF CHOOSING A FIT REPRESENTATIVE OR MORE LIABLE TO BE CORRUPTED BY AN UNFIT ONE THAN FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED REASON ON THE CONTRARY ASSURES US THAT AS IN SO GREAT A NUMBER A FIT REPRESENTATIVE WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO BE FOUND
MEN UPON TOO MANY OCCASIONS DO NOT GIVE THEIR OWN UNDERSTANDINGS FAIR PLAY BUT YIELDING TO SOME UNTOWARD BIAS THEY ENTANGLE THEMSELVES IN WORDS AND CONFOUND THEMSELVES IN SUBTLETIES
INCONSISTENT WITH EVERY IDEA OF VIGOR OR EFFICIENCY WHO CAN PRETEND THAT COMMERCIAL IMPOSTS ARE OR WOULD BE ALONE EQUAL TO THE PRESENT AND FUTURE EXIGENCIES OF THE UNION
AND BY TRANSFERRING TO OTHER HANDS THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS INTERESTING BRANCH OF THE BRITISH COMMERCE A MATURE CONSIDERATION OF THE OBJECTS SUGGESTED BY THESE QUESTIONS WILL JUSTIFY A BELIEF
THEY HOLD THEIR SEATS SOME FOR LIFE SOME FOR SIX THREE AND ONE YEARS FROM TWO PROVINCES THEY CONTINUE IN APPOINTMENT DURING PLEASURE THE STATES GENERAL HAVE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO TREATIES AND ALLIANCES
OR BY ANY OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL MODE THERE IS NO EXPRESS DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO THEM TO USE FORCE AGAINST DELINQUENT MEMBERS
THE CERTAIN EVILS AND THE PROBABLE DANGERS TO WHICH EVERY STATE WILL BE EXPOSED FROM ITS DISSOLUTION THIS SHALL ACCORDINGLY CONSTITUTE THE SUBJECT OF MY NEXT ADDRESS

IN DEVISING AND PUTTING INTO ACTION NEW METHODS FOR ACCOMPLISHING THEIR ENDS AS A RULE THEY WERE A NUISANCE AND A WEARINESS TO THE FLESH BUT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THEY VERGED ON THE PICTURESQUE

JAMES CUSHAT PRINKLY WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY OBSTINATE OR INDIFFERENT TO HOME INFLUENCES TO DISREGARD THE OBVIOUSLY EXPRESSED WISH OF HIS FAMILY THAT HE SHOULD BECOME ENAMOURED OF SOME NICE MARRIAGEABLE GIRL
SHE HAD WRITTEN TO PROPOSE HERSELF AS A GUEST FOR A DEFINITE DATE SOME WEEK AHEAD THE FAMILY SHE REFLECTED WITH RELIEF WAS NOT A LARGE ONE THE TWO DAUGHTERS WERE MARRIED AND AWAY
ONLY ADDED TO THE MYSTERY OF THE SITUATION DON'T YOU LONG TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WITH OUR TREASURE HOARD LENA ASKED THE PRIME MINISTER ONE DAY WHEN SHE HAPPENED TO SIT NEXT TO HIM
BROKE IN THE BOOKAGENT WITH A TIRED NOTE SOUNDING IN HIS VOICE FOR THE FIRST TIME FORESTRY INSECT LIFE BIRD MIGRATION RECLAMATION OF WASTE LANDS AS I WAS SAYING NO MAN WHO HAS TO DEAL WITH THE VARIED INTERESTS OF LIFE
THEY ASSEMBLED IN FORCE ON THE OPENING DAY OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY EXHIBITION AND DESTROYED SOME THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED OF THE PICTURES THIS PROVED AN EVEN WORSE FAILURE THAN THE PARROT BUSINESS
WERE DISALLOWED BUT EVEN SO JUTTERLY WAS SIX AHEAD WITH ONLY THIRTY MORE TO BE COUNTED TO THE WATCHERS BY THE STYE THE MOMENTS SEEMED INTOLERABLE AS A LAST RESORT SOME ONE HAD BEEN SENT FOR A GUN WITH WHICH TO SHOOT THE SOW
TO SEE IF HER THEORY ABOUT THE NON EXISTENCE OF PAIN COULD BE DEPENDED ON IN AN EMERGENCY THE WASP WAS SMALL BUT VERY EFFICIENT
BUT AFTER ALL WE HAD TO LIVE IN THE MIDST OF THEM SIR LULWORTH INTERRUPTED HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT TO SAY A FEW KIND WORDS TO THE LIQUEUR BRANDY HE HAD JUST TASTED AND THEM RESUMED HIS NARRATIVE
VICARS ARE DREADFULLY PROVOCATIVE AT TIMES NOW IF YOU COULD ONLY FIND OUT FOR ME WHETHER THESE TWO MEN ARE DIVERGENTLY FOR OR AGAINST
AND WHEN HIS UNCLE JULES DEPARTED THIS LIFE AND BEQUEATHED HIM A COMFORTABLE LITTLE LEGACY IT REALLY SEEMED THE CORRECT THING TO DO TO SET ABOUT DISCOVERING SOME ONE TO SHARE IT WITH HIM
SHE LACKED NOTHING THAT IS TO BE FOUND IN A CAREFULLY DETAILED FASHION PLATE IN FACT SHE MIGHT BE SAID TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN THE AVERAGE FASHION PLATE FEMALE POSSESSES IN PLACE OF A VACANT EXPRESSIONLESS STARE SHE HAD CHARACTER IN HER FACE
THE PROCESS OF DISCOVERY WAS CARRIED ON MORE BY THE FORCE OF SUGGESTION AND THE WEIGHT OF PUBLIC OPINION THAN BY ANY INITIATIVE OF HIS OWN
BUT ONE CAN GENERALLY FIND OUT BEFOREHAND WHAT PEOPLE'S OPINIONS MY DEAR THE YEAR BEFORE IT WAS WORSE IT WAS CHRISTIAN SCIENCE SELINA GOOBIE IS A SORT OF HIGH PRIESTESS OF THE CULT
IN A CLAMOROUS CLOUD OF GREEN AND GREY AND SCARLET IT WAS REALLY RATHER A STRIKING EPISODE FROM THE SPECTACULAR POINT OF VIEW UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER FOR ITS DEVISERS
BAZARS DOGS AND DONKEYS THESE I SUPPOSE ARE WHAT CONSTANTINOPLE SUGGESTS WHENEVER ITS NAME IS MENTIONED TO ANY GIRL OR BOY OF TO DAY THE CAPITAL OF MODERN TURKEY THE CITY OF THE SUBLIME PORTE
PULCHERIA OF CONSTANTINOPLE THE GIRL OF THE GOLDEN HORN AFTERWARD KNOWN AS PULCHERIA AUGUSTA EMPRESS OF THE EAST
HAD HIS CHRISTIAN MISSION HOUSE AND WAS ZEALOUSLY BRINGING TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF A GREAT AND ENLIGHTENED PEOPLE THE STILL GREATER AND MORE HELPFUL LIGHT OF CHRISTIANITY MY DAUGHTER SAID THE NESTORIAN AFTER HIS WORDS OF THANKS WERE UTTERED
YOU WHO PRATE SO LOUDLY WOULD BETTER PROVE YOUR WORDS BY SOME SIGN OF YOUR OWN VALOR YOU MAY HAVE DARED FIGHT YOUR LADY MOTHER WHO SO ROUNDLY PUNISHED YOU THEREFOR BUT A LION HATH NOT THE TENDER WAYS OF A WOMAN
EMPEROR THOUGH HE WAS CALLED WAS ONLY A BOY OF TWELVE AND NOT A VERY BRIGHT BOY AT THAT HIS FATHER ARCADIUS THE EMPEROR AND HIS MOTHER EUDOXIA THE EMPRESS WERE DEAD AND IN THE GREAT PALACE AT CONSTANTINOPLE IN THIS YEAR OF GRACE
BUT AJAX FIERCEST OF THE THREE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE LAD STRAIGHT ACROSS HIS COMRADES HE LOOKED TO WHERE SCARCE A ROD BEHIND THE DARING LAD CAME ANOTHER FIGURE A LIGHT AND GRACEFUL FORM
AND SO BETWEEN ALL THESE YOUNG FOLK THERE WAS MUCH BOASTFUL TALK AND MUCH HARMLESS GOSSIP HOW THE LITTLE LADY OF COURTRAI HAD USED THE WRONG CORNER OF THE TOWEL YESTERDAY
MARGARET THE EMPRESS AND PHILIPPA THE QUEEN AND OF A HOUSE THAT TRACED ITS DESCENT THROUGH THE WARLIKE HOHENSTAUFENS BACK TO CHARLEMAGNE HIMSELF ALL GIRLS ADMIRE BRAVERY EVEN THOUGH NOT THEMSELVES PERSONALLY COURAGEOUS
SHE WISHED THAT SHE COULD TURN THIS BRAVE YOUNG CHIEF AWAY FROM HIS HEATHEN DEITIES THOR AND ODIN
BUT THE GREATEST GLORY OF CONSTANTINOPLE WAS AWAY BACK IN THE EARLY DAYS BEFORE THE TIME OF MOHAMMED OR OF THE CRUSADERS WHEN IT WAS THE CENTRE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION THE CHIEF AND GORGEOUS CAPITAL OF A CHRISTIAN EMPIRE
HE BROUGHT ALL THE LAND UNDER HIS SWAY FROM THE RHINE TO THE RHONE THE OCEAN AND THE PYRENEES HE WAS HAILED BY HIS PEOPLE WITH THE OLD ROMAN TITLES OF CONSUL AND AUGUSTUS
HE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS HOWEVER TO HAVE THE PRINCESS CLOTILDA BROUGHT UP IN HIS PALACE WHICH HAD BEEN HER FATHER'S
HAD MURDERED KING CHILPERIC THE FATHER OF LITTLE CLOTILDA THE QUEEN HER MOTHER
HE RAISED THE OTHER IN STERN AND FEARLESS PROTEST AND BOLDLY FACED THE MURDEROUS THRONG BACK MEN OF BLOOD HE CRIED BACK
SEE LORD OF ARKELL YOU WHO CAN PRATE SO LOUDLY OF CODS AND LIONS HERE BEFORE ALL I DARE YOU TO FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS YOURSELF THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL WAS IN HIS RICH COURT SUIT A TIGHT FITTING GREAT SLEEVED SILK JACKET
AND PULCHERIA ASCENDED THE GOLDEN THRONE OF CONSTANTINOPLE THE FIRST WOMAN THAT EVER RULED AS SOLE EMPRESS OF THE ROMAN WORLD SHE DIED
SHE WAS DAUGHTER OF HOLLAND COUNTESS OF PONTHIEU DUCHESS OF BERRY LADY OF CREVECOEUR OF MONTAGUE AND ARLOEUX BROUGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF TILTS AND TOURNAMENTS OF BANQUETS AND FEASTING AND ALL THE LAVISH DISPLAY OF THE RICH BAVARIAN COURT
NEVER TO APPEAR SURPRISED AND ALWAYS TO BE READY TO ACT QUICKLY SO KNOWING NOTHING OF THE POSSIBLE RESULTS OF HIS ACTION
AS HE HAD TUMBLED IN SHE WAS FACING THE ENEMY
AND MAKE YOU ALL CAPTIVES AND SLAVES IT SHALL BE WAR BETWEEN YOU AND US FOREVER THUS SAITH MY SPEAR AND AS HE SPOKE HE DASHED HIS LONG SPEAR UPON THE FLOOR UNTIL THE MOSAIC PAVEMENT RANG AGAIN BOY EMPEROR AND PRINCESSES
SAID THE PREFECT ANTHEMIUS WHEN THE GLITTERING REAR GUARD HAD PASSED FROM THE HIPPODROME AND THE PRINCESS PULCHERIA ADDED AND THESE O MEN FROM THE NORTH ARE TO HELP AND SUCCOR THE FRIENDS OF THE GREAT EMPEROR
WHO HAD SEEN SO SHREWDLY AND SO WELL THE WAY TO THE HEARTS OF THESE NORTHERN BARBARIANS TO WHOM GOLD AND WARLIKE DISPLAY WERE AS MEAT AND DRINK YOU HEAR THE WORDS OF THIS WISE YOUNG MAID HE SAID
THEODOSIUS THE BOY EMPEROR AND HIS THREE SISTERS PULCHERIA MARINA AND ARCADIA
IT WAS THE METROPOLIS OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE GREAT ROMAN EMPIRE AND DURING THIS PERIOD OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS ALL THE WEALTH AND TREASURE OF THE EAST POURED INTO CONSTANTINOPLE WHILE ALL THE GLORIES OF THE EMPIRE
THE ANSWER OF THE GIRL WAS AS READY AS IT WAS UNEXPECTED
BUT IT WAS NO LONGER HOME TO THE LITTLE PRINCESS CLOTILDA SHE THOUGHT OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND OF HER BROTHERS THE LITTLE PRINCES WITH WHOM SHE HAD PLAYED IN THIS VERY PALACE AS IT NOW SEEMED TO HER SO MANY YEARS AGO
WAS FULL AS STRANGE AS ANY FOR CHINA
WITH THEIR TRAIN OF ATTENDANT MAIDENS RENOUNCED THE VANITY OF DRESS WEARING ONLY PLAIN AND SIMPLE ROBES THEY SPENT THEIR TIME IN MAKING GARMENTS FOR THE POOR AND EMBROIDERED WORK FOR CHURCH DECORATIONS AND WITH SONG AND PRAYER AND FRUGAL MEALS
SUBORDINATION PASSIVE SUBMISSION TO THE LAW TO PARENTS AND TO ALL SUPERIORS AND A PEACEFUL DEMEANOR
TO SEND MESSENGERS WITHOUT DELAY TO DEMAND ME OF MY UNCLE KING GUNDEBALD AND LET THOSE SAME MESSENGERS TAKE ME AWAY IN HASTE SO SOON AS THEY SHALL HAVE OBTAINED PERMISSION FOR THIS WISE YOUNG PRINCESS KNEW
WHEN EXTENDED TO PERSONS IN PERIL WAS CALLED THE RIGHT OF SANCTUARY
THE LORD OF ARKELL SPRANG TO HIS COMRADE'S SIDE WITH A HURRIED WORD OF PRAISE HE FLUNG THE GABARDINE ABOUT HER GRASPED HER ARM AND BADE HER KEEP HER EYES FIRMLY FIXED UPON THE LIONS THEN STEP BY STEP THOSE TWO FOOLHARDY YOUNG PERSONS BACKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE DANGER
SHE SAILED FROM THE OLD HARBOR OF ROTTERDAM AND THE LION FLAG OF HER HOUSE SOON FLOATED ABOVE THE LOYAL CITADEL OF GORKUM HER DOUGHTY DUTCH GENERAL VON BREDERODE COUNSELLED IMMEDIATE ATTACK BUT THE GIRL COUNTESS THOUGH FULL OF ENTHUSIASM AND DETERMINATION HESITATED
EVEN THE CHIVALRY OF THAT DAY WHICH SHOULD HAVE PROMPTED HIM TO AID RATHER THAN ANNOY THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE RAISED A CONSIDERABLE ARMY AMONG THE KNIGHTS OF THE CODS OR LIBERAL PARTY AND THE WARLIKE MERCHANTS OF THE CITIES TOOK POSSESSION OF MANY STRONG POSITIONS IN HOLLAND
ON THE IMPULSE OF THIS THOUGHT SHE SUMMONED A LOYAL AND TRUSTED VASSAL TO HER AID VON LEYENBURG SHE SAID GO YOU IN HASTE AND IN SECRET TO THE LORD OF ARKELL AND BEAR FROM ME THIS MESSAGE FOR HIS EAR ALONE THUS SAYS THE LADY OF HOLLAND
SAID THE CLEAR CALM VOICE OF THE UNTERRIFIED GIRL WERE IT NOT WISE TO TELL THIS WILD YOUNG PRINCE FROM THE NORTHERN FOREST THAT THE GREAT EMPEROR HATH GOLD FOR HIS FRIENDS BUT ONLY IRON FOR HIS FOES
HOW THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE RIGHTFUL EMPEROR THE PRINCE KUNG TI WHOSE GUARDIAN AND CHIEF ADVISER THE PRESENT EMPEROR HAD BEEN HOW THIS TRUSTED PROTECTOR HAD MADE AWAY WITH POOR KUNG TI
THAT HER UNCLE'S WORD WAS NOT TO BE LONG DEPENDED UPON AND SHE FEARED TOO THAT CERTAIN ADVISERS AT HER UNCLE'S COURT MIGHT COUNSEL HIM TO DO HER HARM BEFORE THE MESSENGERS OF KING CLOVIS COULD HAVE CONDUCTED HER BEYOND THE BORDERS OF BURGUNDY AURELIAN
NOBLES AND PAGES AND LITTLE LADIES IN WAITING AND THERE WAS MUCH OF THE STATELY CEREMONIAL AND FLOWERY TALK THAT IN THOSE DAYS OF KNIGHTHOOD CLOTHED ALIKE THE FEARS OF COWARDS AND THE DESIRES OF HEROES FOR THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HEROES AND COWARDS IN THE WORLD
MADE FRANCE A CHRISTIAN NATION AND SO HELPED ON THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION
FOR HER CRUEL UNCLE GUNDEBALD WAGING WAR AGAINST HIS BROTHER CHILPERIC THE RIGHTFUL KING OF BURGUNDY HAD WITH A BAND OF SAVAGE FOLLOWERS BURST INTO HIS BROTHER'S PALACE AND AFTER THE FIERCE AND RELENTLESS FASHION OF THOSE CRUEL DAYS
YOUNG CLOVIS IN A DRESS OF CRIMSON AND GOLD AND MILK WHITE SILK AND WITH HIS YELLOW HAIR COILED IN A GREAT TOP KNOT ON HIS UNCOVERED HEAD ADVANCED TO MEET HIS BRIDE MY LORD KING SAID CLOTILDA
SCYTHIA SHOULD BE MINE PERSIA SHOULD BE MINE ROME SHOULD BE MINE AND LOOK YOU SIR EMPEROR THE TIME SHALL SURELY COME WHEN THE KING OF THE HUNS SHALL BE CONTENT NOT WITH PALTRY TRIBUTE AND NEEDLESS OFFICE
A BRANCH OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH ORIGINATING IN ASIA MINOR IN THE FIFTH CENTURY AND OFTEN CALLED THE PROTESTANTS OF THE EAST HAD BEEN SPREADING THE STORY OF THE LIFE AND LOVE OF CHRIST AND HERE
A CRY OF TERROR BROKE FROM EVERY LIP THE DAUPHIN JOHN TURNED PALE WITH FRIGHT AND COUNT WILLIAM OF HOLLAND CALLING OUT DOWN AJAX BACK GIRL BACK
THE EVENT PASSED INTO A LEGEND AND AFTERWARDS WHEN LATER INSTANCES OF PLUCK AND ENDURANCE WERE SPOKEN OF THE BOYS WOULD SAY
A MONTH AFTER MY DEPARTURE FROM RIVERMOUTH THE CAPTAIN INFORMED ME BY LETTER THAT HE HAD PARTED WITH THE LITTLE MARE ACCORDING TO AGREEMENT SHE HAD BEEN SOLD TO THE RING MASTER OF A TRAVELLING CIRCUS
IN ONE OF THE CHOLERA HOSPITAL WARDS AND THE DESMOULINS NEAR NEIGHBORS OF OURS HAD PURCHASED THE PRETTY STONE HOUSE AMONG THE ORANGE TREES HOW ALL THESE SIMPLE DETAILS INTERESTED ME WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD
EVERY BOY IN THIS SCHOOL KNOWS THAT IT IS AGAINST THE RULES TO FIGHT IF ONE BOY MALTREATS ANOTHER WITHIN SCHOOL BOUNDS OR WITHIN SCHOOL HOURS THAT IS A MATTER FOR ME TO SETTLE THE CASE SHOULD BE LAID BEFORE ME
AT LENGTH THE PROVISION AGAINST USING HEAVY SUBSTANCES IN THE SNOW BALLS WAS DISREGARDED A BALL STUCK FULL OF SAND BIRD SHOT CAME TEARING INTO FORT SLATTER IN RETALIATION GENERAL HARRIS ORDERED A BROADSIDE OF SHELLS
ESCORTED BY TWO OR THREE OF THE SCHOOLFELLOWS I WALKED HOME THROUGH THE PLEASANT AUTUMN TWILIGHT BATTERED BUT TRIUMPHANT AS I WENT ALONG MY CAP COCKED ON ONE SIDE TO KEEP THE CHILLY AIR FROM MY EYE
I AM SURE THAT THE READER WHO HAS FOLLOWED ME THUS FAR WILL BE WILLING TO HEAR WHAT BECAME OF HER AND SAILOR BEN AND MISS ABIGAIL AND THE CAPTAIN FIRST ABOUT GYPSY
THAT THERE WERE NO VESTIGES TO BE SEEN OF THE FEARFUL GULFS OVER WHICH I HAD PASSED SO CAUTIOUSLY MY ASCENT HAD BEEN TO THE TOP OF THE HOGSHEAD AND MY DESCENT TO THE BOTTOM THEREOF HOLDING ONE ANOTHER BY THE HAND AND CHANTING A LOW DIRGE
IRRESOLUTELY AND THEN COMMENCED READING IT ALOUD
FOR THE CAPTAIN WAS WELL AWARE OF THE LONG CONTINUED PROVOCATION I HAD ENDURED AH YOU RASCAL CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER HEARING MY STORY JUST LIKE ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG ALWAYS IN ONE KIND OF TROUBLE OR ANOTHER
BUNG FROM THE EAVES OF THE HOUSE AND THE TURKISH SENTINELS AT THE GATE
THE SNOW FORT ON SLATTER'S HILL THE MEMORY OF MAN EVEN THAT OF THE OLDEST INHABITANT RUNNETH NOT BACK TO THE TIME WHEN THERE DID NOT EXIST A FEUD BETWEEN THE NORTH END AND THE SOUTH END BOYS OF RIVERMOUTH
THE ORIGIN OF THE FEUD IS INVOLVED IN MYSTERY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHICH PARTY WAS THE FIRST AGGRESSOR IN THE FAR OFF ANTEREVOLUTIONARY AGES
IT HAPPENED TO BE A HALF HOLIDAY SO I HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT WATCH THE FEATHERY CRYSTALS WHIRLING HITHER AND THITHER THROUGH THE AIR I STOOD BY THE SITTING ROOM WINDOW GAZING AT THE WONDER
CRASH TOWEL STUFFED INTO HER MOUTH
WAS RECOGNIZED AT ONCE IT SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE OVER THE TOWN AND THOUGH THE MORTAR AND THE PLACARD WERE SPEEDILY REMOVED OUR TRIUMPH WAS COMPLETE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WAS ON THE BROAD GRIN AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFAIR SEEMINGLY UNSUSPECTED
OF LOSING HIS LITTLE MESSMATE IN THE EXCITEMENT OF PREPARING FOR THE JOURNEY I DIDN'T FEEL ANY VERY DEEP REGRET MYSELF BUT WHEN THE MOMENT CAME FOR LEAVING AND I SAW MY SMALL TRUNK LASHED UP BEHIND THE CARRIAGE
A FOOTING ON THE PARAPET AND WERE ABLE TO HOLD THE SAME FOR THE SPACE OF TWO MINUTES
HE INTENDED TO KEEP HIS WEATHER EYE ON THEM AND SHOULD SEND A SPERITUAL SHOT ACROSS THEIR BOWS AND BRING THEM TO IF THEY DIDN'T TREAT THE AGED MARINERS HANDSOMELY HE ALSO EXPRESSED A WISH TO HAVE HIS BODY STITCHED UP
DIRECTING HER TO MAKE A SHADE OUT OF CARDBOARD AND BLACK SILK TO TIE OVER MY EYE MISS ABIGAIL MUST HAVE BEEN POSSESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT I HAD TAKEN UP PUGILISM AS A PROFESSION FOR SHE TURNED OUT NO FEWER THAN SIX OF THESE BLINDERS
THEN MY FATHER LAUGHED BUT CAPTAIN TRUCK WOULD GROW VERY ANGRY AND VOW THAT HE WOULD HAVE WON THE GAME IN A MOVE OR TWO MORE IF THE CONFOUNDED OLD CHICKEN COOP THAT'S WHAT HE CALLED THE SHIP HADN'T LURCHED I I THINK I WILL GO TO BED NOW PLEASE I SAID
IN A SHOTTED HAMMOCK AND DROPPED INTO THE HARBOR BUT AS HE DID NOT STRENUOUSLY INSIST ON THIS AND AS IT WAS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY GRANDFATHER'S PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF CHRISTIAN BURIAL
THE FRESH FRUIT AND MILK AND THE SLICES OF COLD CHICKEN LOOKED VERY NICE YET SOMEHOW I HAD NO APPETITE THERE WAS A GENERAL SMELL OF TAR ABOUT EVERYTHING THEN THE SHIP GAVE SUDDEN LURCHES THAT MADE IT A MATTER OF UNCERTAINTY
IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR THE TYPHOON WAS PLUNGING ABOUT IN THE MOST ALARMING FASHION I WAS SPEEDILY TUCKED AWAY IN THE UPPER BERTH WHERE I FELT A TRIFLE MORE EASY AT FIRST
THE CAPTAIN HAS NOW BECOME THE OLDEST INHABITANT IN RIVERMOUTH AND SO I DON'T LAUGH AT THE OLDEST INHABITANT ANY MORE BUT PRAY IN MY HEART THAT HE MAY OCCUPY THE POST OF HONOR FOR HALF A CENTURY TO COME
AT CAPE COD THE WIND PARTED COMPANY WITH US WITHOUT SAYING AS MUCH AS EXCUSE ME SO WE WERE NEARLY TWO DAYS IN MAKING THE RUN WHICH IN FAVORABLE WEATHER IS USUALLY ACCOMPLISHED IN SEVEN HOURS THAT'S WHAT THE PILOT SAID
ONLY IT DIDN'T SEEM AS IF WE WERE MOVING THE SHORE WITH THE COUNTLESS STEAMBOATS THE TANGLED RIGGING OF THE SHIPS AND THE LONG LINES OF WAREHOUSES APPEARED TO BE GLIDING AWAY FROM US IT WAS GRAND SPORT TO STAND ON THE QUARTER DECK AND WATCH ALL THIS
AN OBSERVATION WHICH SEEMED TO ME EXTREMELY HAPPY THOUGH I KNEW LITTLE OR NOTHING CONCERNING THE ENDURANCE OF BRASS MONKEYS HAVING NEVER SEEN ONE I HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THE ADVENT OF THE SEASON WITH GRAVE APPREHENSIONS
AND HAD HALF A MIND TO POP INTO THE SHOP AND SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM AND ASK HIM IF HE WANTED TO FIGHT I CONTENTED MYSELF HOWEVER WITH FLATTENING MY NOSE AGAINST HIS DINGY SHOP WINDOW AND BEHELD CONWAY IN RED WHISKERS AND BLUE OVERALLS
WHICH HERE AND THERE THRUST OUT A WRINKLED BOULDER PREVENTED THE SITE FROM BEING USED FOR BUILDING PURPOSES THE STREET RAN ON EITHER SIDE OF THE HILL FROM ONE PART OF WHICH A QUANTITY OF ROCK HAD BEEN REMOVED TO FORM THE UNDERPINNING OF THE NEW JAIL
IT WAS ALSO WELL KNOWN THAT THE WIDOW CONWAY HAD NOT BURIED HER HEART WITH THE LATE LAMENTED AS TO HER SHYNESS THAT WAS NOT SO CLEAR INDEED HER ATTENTIONS TO MISTER MEEKS WHOSE MOTHER SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
NOW THE FLOOR SEEMED TO RISE AND NOW IT SEEMED TO SINK UNDER ONE'S FEET LIKE A FEATHER BED THERE WERE NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN PASSENGERS ON BOARD INCLUDING OURSELVES AND ALL OF THESE EXCEPTING A BALD HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN A RETIRED SEA CAPTAIN
A DISH OF APPLES AND A PITCHER OF CHILLY CIDER WERE ALWAYS SERVED DURING THE EVENING THE CAPTAIN HAD A
FROM OUR FRONT DOOR TO THE SIDEWALK OPPOSITE IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CAVERN WITH ITS WALLS AND ROOF INLAID WITH MOTHER OF PEARL AND DIAMONDS I AM SURE THE ICE PALACE OF THE RUSSIAN EMPRESS
YANKEE DOODLE WHILE WE CHEERED AND JEERED THEM UNTIL THEY WERE OUT OF HEARING GENERAL AMES REMAINED BEHIND TO EFFECT AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS WE HELD THIRTEEN OF HIS MEN AND HE ELEVEN OF OURS
WHEN CONWAY RETIRED FROM THE FIELD AS PHIL ADAMS STEPPED UP TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME HE RECEIVED A TELLING BLOW IN THE STOMACH FOR ALL THE FIGHT WAS NOT OUT OF ME YET AND I MISTOOK HIM FOR A NEW ADVERSARY
WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW I REFLECTED AS THE MONKEY SAID WHEN HE FELL OUT OF THE COCOANUT TREE ADDED CHARLEY MARDEN TRYING TO MAKE ME LAUGH IT WAS EARLY CANDLE LIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE
OUR TUNNEL WAS TURNED INTO SOLID ICE A CRUST THICK ENOUGH TO BEAR MEN AND HORSES HAD FORMED OVER THE SNOW EVERYWHERE AND THE AIR WAS ALIVE WITH MERRY SLEIGH BELLS ICY STALACTITES A YARD LONG
CASTING DESTRUCTIVE GLANCES ACROSS THE STREET THE ARTIFICIAL ROSES IN HER CAP AND HER WHOLE LANGUISHING MANNER SAYING AS PLAINLY AS A LABEL ON A PRESCRIPTION TO BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY BUT MISTER MEEKS DIDN'T TAKE
FLOATING DEFIANTLY FROM THE FLAG STAFF IN LESS THAN AN HOUR IT WAS KNOWN ALL OVER TOWN IN MILITARY CIRCLES AT LEAST THAT THE PUDDLE DOCKERS AND THE RIVER RATS
OF ZULEIKA THE FAMED ARABIAN TRICK PONY BUT I FAILED TO RECOGNIZE MY DEAR LITTLE MUSTANG GIRL BEHIND THOSE HIGH SOUNDING TITLES AND SO ALAS DID NOT ATTEND THE PERFORMANCE
MY MOTHER HAD ARRIVED AT NEW YORK AND WOULD BE WITH US THE NEXT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS YEARS IT SEEMED TO ME SOMETHING OF THE OLD CHEERFULNESS MINGLED WITH OUR CONVERSATION ROUND THE EVENING LAMP
OUR STREET WAS A SIGHT TO BE SEEN OR RATHER IT WAS A SIGHT NOT TO BE SEEN FOR VERY LITTLE STREET WAS VISIBLE
I HOPE ALL THE PRAISES SHE RECEIVED AND ALL THE SPANGLED TRAPPINGS SHE WORE DID NOT SPOIL HER BUT I AM AFRAID THEY DID FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS OVER MUCH GIVEN TO THE VANITIES OF THIS WORLD
AND TOLD THAT THAT WOULD BE HER HOME UNTIL SHE SHOULD YIELD TO HER MASTER'S WISHES THERE SHE REMAINED MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A DAILY VISIT FROM HER MASTER SHE SAW NO ONE BUT THE OLD NEGRESS WHO WAITED UPON HER
AND THE CLERGYMAN LEFT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO HIM AT HIS HOUSE IT SEEMED AS IF POOR ALTHESA WOULD HAVE WEPT HERSELF TO DEATH FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS AFTER HER MOTHER HAD BEEN TORN FROM HER SIDE BY THE HAND OF THE RUTHLESS TRAFFICKER IN HUMAN FLESH
SHALL YET ASSAIL AND REND DISSIMULATION'S VEIL
AND MUST NOT THIS CONCLUSION BE STRENGTHENED WHEN THEY HEAR MINISTERS OF TALENT AND LEARNING DECLARE THAT THE BIBLE DOES SANCTION SLAVEHOLDING AND THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE MADE A DISCIPLINABLE OFFENCE IN CHURCHES AND MUST NOT ALL DOUBT BE DISSIPATED WHEN ONE OF THE MOST LEARNED PROFESSORS IN OUR THEOLOGICAL SEMINARIES
TO BEHOLD FIVE OR SIX TABLES IN A STEAMBOAT'S CABIN WITH HALF A DOZEN MEN PLAYING AT CARDS AND MONEY PISTOLS BOWIE KNIVES ALL IN CONFUSION ON THE TABLES IS WHAT MAY BE SEEN AT ALMOST ANY TIME ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ON THE FOURTH DAY WHILE AT NATCHEZ
AND WHOSE MINISTERS PREACH THAT SLAVERY IS A GOD ORDAINED INSTITUTION WHAT WORDS CAN TELL THE INHUMANITY THE ATROCITY AND THE IMMORALITY OF THAT DOCTRINE WHICH FROM EXALTED OFFICE COMMENDS SUCH A CRIME TO THE FAVOUR OF ENLIGHTENED AND CHRISTIAN PEOPLE
KNEW OF THEIR DEPARTURE A MARCH OF EIGHT DAYS THROUGH THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE AND THEY ARRIVED ON THE BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER WHERE THEY WERE ALL PUT ON BOARD A STEAMER AND THEN SPEEDILY SAILED FOR THE PLACE OF THEIR DESTINATION
THE PROGRESS OF THE HEAT WITHIN WAS MARKED BY YELLOWISH SPOTS WHICH SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE OF THE BODY IF THEN A HAPPY CRISIS CAME NOT ALL HOPE WAS GONE SOON THE BREATH INFECTED THE AIR WITH A FETID ODOUR THE LIPS WERE GLAZED
THE VERY APPEARANCE OF THE YOUNG SOUTHERNER POINTED HIM OUT AS AN UNPRINCIPLED PROFLIGATE AND THE YOUNG GIRL NEEDED NO ONE TO TELL HER OF HER IMPENDING DOOM THE YOUNG MAID OF FIFTEEN WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED
THE MARRIAGE RELATION THE OLDEST AND MOST SACRED INSTITUTION GIVEN TO MAN BY HIS CREATOR IS UNKNOWN AND UNRECOGNISED IN THE SLAVE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD THAT WE COULD SAY THAT THE MORAL AND RELIGIOUS TEACHING IN THE SLAVE STATES WERE BETTER THAN THE LAWS
THAT HE MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM SUCH A FATE HE EVEN OFFERED TO MORTGAGE HIS LITTLE FARM IN VERMONT FOR THE AMOUNT WHICH YOUNG SLAVE WOMEN OF THEIR AGES WOULD FETCH BUT THE CREDITORS PLEADED THAT THEY WERE AN EXTRA ARTICLE AND WOULD SELL FOR MORE THAN COMMON SLAVES
WITHOUT ANY PREMONITION SOMETIMES DEATH WAS THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE THE DISORDER BEGAN IN THE BRAIN BY AN OPPRESSIVE PAIN ACCOMPANIED OR FOLLOWED BY FEVER THE PATIENT WAS DEVOURED WITH BURNING THIRST THE STOMACH DISTRACTED BY PAINS
FOR MENSTEALERS FOR LIARS FOR PERJURED PERSONS A MORE SCATHING DENUNCIATION OF THE SIN IN QUESTION IS SURELY TO BE FOUND ON RECORD IN NO OTHER BOOK I AM AFRAID CONTINUED THE DAUGHTER THAT THE ACTS OF THE PROFESSED FRIENDS OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE SOUTH
BUT OF LATER YEARS HAD BEEN A LAUNDRESS OR WASHERWOMAN AND WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A WOMAN OF GREAT TASTE IN GETTING UP LINEN THE GENTLEMAN FOR WHOM SHE HAD KEPT HOUSE WAS THOMAS JEFFERSON BY WHOM SHE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS
THE MANTLED TREACHERY OF HIS SOUL O WHERE IS HE WHO HATH SURVEYED THE HORRORS OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THERE IS AN EYE THAT WAKES IN LIGHT THERE IS A HAND OF PEERLESS MIGHT WHICH SOON OR LATE
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ONLY FIVE HUNDRED FOR SUCH A GIRL AS THIS GENTLEMEN SHE IS WORTH A DEAL MORE THAN THAT SUM YOU CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW THE VALUE OF THE ARTICLE YOU ARE BIDDING UPON HERE GENTLEMEN I HOLD IN MY HAND A PAPER CERTIFYING THAT SHE HAS A GOOD MORAL CHARACTER
BUT NOW YOU IS ONLY THIRTY YEARS OLD DAT IS WHAT MARSER SAYS YOU IS TO BE I KNOW I IS MORE DEN DAT RESPONDED THE MAN I KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT DAT
SUCH IS THE INFLUENCE OF SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THE MINISTERS OF RELIGION EVEN IN THE SO CALLED FREE STATES ARE THE MERE ECHOES INSTEAD OF THE CORRECTORS OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT
HERE WE SEE GOD DEALING IN SLAVES GIVING THEM TO HIS OWN FAVOURITE CHILD ABRAHAM A MAN OF SUPERLATIVE WORTH AND AS A REWARD FOR HIS EMINENT GOODNESS
ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND SOLD TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER HUSBANDS AND WIVES WERE SEPARATED WITH A DEGREE OF INDIFFERENCE THAT IS UNKNOWN IN ANY OTHER RELATION OF LIFE EXCEPT THAT OF SLAVERY BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE TORN FROM EACH OTHER
ALTHESA ALTHOUGH AS WHITE AS MOST WHITE WOMEN IN A SOUTHERN CLIME WAS AS WE ALREADY KNOW BORN A SLAVE BY THE LAWS OF ALL THE SOUTHERN STATES THE CHILDREN FOLLOW THE CONDITION OF THE MOTHER IF THE MOTHER IS FREE THE CHILDREN ARE FREE
YOU IS NOW TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AN NO MORE DUS YOU HEAR DAT YES RESPONDED TOBY
WHEN HE DESIGNED TO DO US GOOD HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE FORM OF A SERVANT HE TOOK HIS STATION AT THE BOTTOM OF SOCIETY HE VOLUNTARILY IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH THE POOR AND THE DESPISED THE WARNING VOICES OF JEREMIAH AND EZEKIEL WERE RAISED IN OLDEN TIME AGAINST SIN
DIS NIGGER IS NO COUNTEFIT HE IS DE GENEWINE ARTEKIL
WHY GEORGIANA MY DEAR YOU ARE MAD AIN'T YOU EXCLAIMED HE IN AN EXCITED TONE THE POOR GIRL REMAINED SILENT THE FATHER SAW IN A MOMENT THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TOO SHARPLY AND TAKING HER HAND IN HIS HE SAID
TO FORBID SECOND MARRIAGES IN SUCH CASES WOULD BE TO EXPOSE THE PARTIES NOT ONLY TO STRONGER HARDSHIPS AND STRONG TEMPTATION BUT TO CHURCH CENSURE FOR ACTING IN OBEDIENCE TO THEIR MASTERS WHO CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO ACQUIESCE IN A REGULATION AT VARIANCE WITH JUSTICE TO THE SLAVES
LET US NOT DECEIVE OURSELVES INTO THE IDEA THAT SLAVERY IS RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS PROFITABLE TO US SLAVEHOLDING IS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT TO TAKE FROM A MAN HIS EARNINGS IS THEFT BUT TO TAKE THE EARNER IS A COMPOUND LIFE LONG THEFT
ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A MAN WHO FROM APPEARANCE WAS NOT LESS THAN FORTY IF I LIVE TO SEE NEXT CORN PLANTING TIME I WILL EITHER BE FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW WHICH
IN VAIN SOUGHT RELIEF IN EFFORTS TO DISBURDEN ITSELF FIERY VEINS STREAKED THE EYE THE FACE WAS INFLAMED AND DYED OF A DARK DULL RED COLOUR THE EARS FROM TIME TO TIME RANG PAINFULLY
IT IS THE MOST INTIMATE COVENANT OF HEART FORMED AMONG MANKIND AND FOR MANY PERSONS THE ONLY RELATION IN WHICH THEY FEEL THE TRUE SENTIMENTS OF HUMANITY IT GIVES SCOPE FOR EVERY HUMAN VIRTUE SINCE EACH OF THESE IS DEVELOPED FROM THE LOVE AND CONFIDENCE WHICH HERE PREDOMINATE
THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN FELT THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING UP TO THAT FAITH THAT SHE PROFESSED AND BELIEVED IN IF SHE DID NOT EXERT HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO SAVE THE THOUGHTLESS MAN FROM HIS DOWNWARD CAREER AND IN THIS SHE SUCCEEDED TO HER MOST SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS
TO HIS COUNTRY SEAT NEAR THE JUNCTION OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WITH THE SEA THIS WAS A MOST SINGULAR SPOT REMOTE IN A DENSE FOREST SPREADING OVER THE SUMMIT OF A CLIFF THAT ROSE ABRUPTLY TO A GREAT HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA
IT UNITES ALL WHICH ENNOBLES AND BEAUTIFIES LIFE SYMPATHY KINDNESS OF WILL AND DEED GRATITUDE DEVOTION AND EVERY DELICATE INTIMATE FEELING AS THE ONLY ASYLUM FOR TRUE EDUCATION IT IS THE FIRST AND LAST SANCTUARY OF HUMAN CULTURE
THEIR GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS AT ONCE PRONOUNCED THEM TO BE ABOVE THE AGES SET DOWN IN THE TRADER'S ADVERTISEMENT
AND SHOW A WILLINGNESS TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF GOD ON THIS SUBJECT MARRIAGE IS INDEED THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE THE FOUNDATION OF ALL CIVILISATION AND CULTURE THE ROOT OF CHURCH AND STATE
FARMERS WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OF RAISING SLAVES FOR THE MARKET WERE THERE SLAVE TRADERS AND SPECULATORS WERE ALSO NUMEROUSLY REPRESENTED AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS THRONG WAS ONE WHO FELT A DEEPER INTEREST IN THE RESULT OF THE SALE THAN ANY OTHER OF THE BYSTANDERS
CLOTEL WAS THE LAST AND AS WAS EXPECTED COMMANDED A HIGHER PRICE THAN ANY THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED FOR SALE THAT DAY THE APPEARANCE OF CLOTEL ON THE AUCTION BLOCK CREATED A DEEP SENSATION AMONGST THE CROWD
SHOULD DO OUR UTMOST TO EXTIRPATE SLAVERY FROM THE LAND FOR MY OWN PART I SHALL DO ALL I CAN WHEN THE REDEEMER WAS ABOUT TO ASCEND TO THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER AND RESUME THE GLORY WHICH HE HAD WITH HIM BEFORE THE WORLD WAS HE PROMISED HIS DISCIPLES THAT THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST SHOULD COME UPON THEM
AT THE TIME OF THE DECEASE OF HER MASTER CURRER'S DAUGHTERS CLOTEL AND ALTHESA WERE AGED RESPECTIVELY SIXTEEN AND FOURTEEN YEARS AND BOTH LIKE MOST OF THEIR OWN SEX IN AMERICA WERE WELL GROWN
SWEPT AWAY BY THE RAGING DISORDER THAT YEAR LIKE TOO MANY MORTON HAD BEEN DEALING EXTENSIVELY IN LANDS AND STOCKS AND THOUGH APPARENTLY IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES WAS IN REALITY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN DEBT
AND WITH ALL THE TIMIDITY THAT SUCH A LIFE COULD PRODUCE BARTERED AWAY LIKE CATTLE IN SMITHFIELD MARKET ELLEN THE ELDEST WAS SOLD TO AN OLD GENTLEMAN WHO PURCHASED HER AS HE SAID FOR A HOUSEKEEPER
ALL WENT ON WELL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK THE BOAT ARRIVED AT NEW ORLEANS
WALKER HAD ALREADY ADVERTISED IN THE NEW ORLEANS PAPERS THAT HE WOULD BE THERE AT A STATED TIME WITH A PRIME LOT OF ABLE BODIED SLAVES READY FOR FIELD SERVICE TOGETHER WITH A FEW EXTRA ONES BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE
HE HAD NO SOONER RECEIVED HER LETTER THAN HE SET OUT FOR NEW ORLEANS AND FINDING ON HIS ARRIVAL THERE THAT HIS MISTRESS HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY RESOLVED TO FOLLOW HER THERE HE WAS
THIS OCCURRED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE AND CREATED AT THE TIME A VERY PROFOUND SENSATION WHEREVER IT WAS MADE THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSE
THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M VALDEMAR
THE PULSE WAS IMPERCEPTIBLE THE BREATHING WAS GENTLE SCARCELY NOTICEABLE UNLESS THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF A MIRROR TO THE LIPS THE EYES WERE CLOSED NATURALLY
LAY AT THE FOOT OF A GENTLE DECLIVITY JUST BEFORE ME I COULD SEE NOTHING DISTINCTLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE MIST WHICH OCCUPIED ALL THE LITTLE VALLEY BELOW A GENTLE BREEZE HOWEVER NOW AROSE AS THE SUN WAS ABOUT DESCENDING AND
THE RIGHT IN ITS UPPER PORTION WAS ALSO PARTIALLY IF NOT THOROUGHLY OSSIFIED WHILE THE LOWER REGION WAS MERELY A MASS
TOGETHER IN THE ATTEMPT BUT NO VOICE ISSUED FROM THE CAVERNOUS LUNGS WHICH OPPRESSED AS IF BY THE WEIGHT OF SOME INCUMBENT MOUNTAIN GASPED AND PALPITATED WITH THE HEART AT EVERY ELABORATE AND STRUGGLING INSPIRATION THE MOVEMENT OF THE JAWS IN THIS EFFORT TO CRY ALOUD SHOWED
WHICH APPEARED TO AWAKEN HIM FROM A DEEP SLEEP BUT NO SOONER WAS HE AWAKE THAN HE BECAME FULLY AWARE OF THE AWFUL HORRORS OF HIS POSITION THIS PATIENT IT IS RECORDED WAS DOING WELL AND SEEMED TO BE IN A FAIR WAY OF ULTIMATE RECOVERY BUT FELL A VICTIM TO
FOR A WHOLE HOUR I DID NOT MOVE A MUSCLE AND IN THE MEANTIME I DID NOT HEAR HIM LIE DOWN HE WAS STILL SITTING UP IN THE BED LISTENING JUST AS I HAVE DONE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HEARKENING TO THE DEATH WATCHES IN THE WALL
DOCTOR F THEN INTIMATED A DESIRE TO HAVE ME PUT A QUESTION I DID SO AS FOLLOWS M VALDEMAR CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS OR WISHES NOW
THERE WERE BUFFOONS THERE WERE IMPROVISATORI THERE WERE BALLET DANCERS THERE WERE MUSICIANS THERE WAS BEAUTY THERE WAS WINE ALL THESE AND SECURITY WERE WITHIN WITHOUT WAS THE RED DEATH
IN MANY PALACES HOWEVER SUCH SUITES FORM A LONG AND STRAIGHT VISTA WHILE THE FOLDING DOORS SLIDE BACK NEARLY TO THE WALLS ON EITHER HAND SO THAT THE VIEW OF THE WHOLE EXTENT IS SCARCELY IMPEDED HERE THE CASE WAS VERY DIFFERENT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE DUKE'S LOVE OF THE BIZARRE
HERE GENERALLY THE SLOPES WERE NOTHING MORE THAN GENTLE INCLINATIONS EXTENDING FROM EAST TO WEST ABOUT
WHO WERE AWARE OF MY PRONENESS TO CATALEPSY LEST FALLING INTO ONE OF MY USUAL FITS I SHOULD BE BURIED BEFORE MY REAL CONDITION COULD BE ASCERTAINED I DOUBTED THE CARE THE FIDELITY OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS I DREADED THAT IN SOME TRANCE
THERE WAS A SHARP CRY AND THE DAGGER DROPPED GLEAMING UPON THE SABLE CARPET UPON WHICH INSTANTLY AFTERWARDS FELL PROSTRATE IN DEATH THE PRINCE PROSPERO
LEAVING THE MOUTH WIDELY EXTENDED AND DISCLOSING IN FULL VIEW THE SWOLLEN AND BLACKENED TONGUE I PRESUME THAT NO MEMBER OF THE PARTY THEN PRESENT HAD BEEN UNACCUSTOMED TO DEATH BED HORRORS BUT SO HIDEOUS BEYOND CONCEPTION
AND REPOSED ON THE BED AT A MODERATE DISTANCE FROM THE LOIN THE HEAD WAS VERY SLIGHTLY ELEVATED WHEN I HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS IT WAS FULLY MIDNIGHT AND I REQUESTED THE GENTLEMEN PRESENT TO EXAMINE M VALDEMAR'S CONDITION
THERE ARRIVED AN EPOCH AS OFTEN BEFORE
EVERYWHERE WAS VARIETY IN UNIFORMITY IT WAS A PIECE OF COMPOSITION IN WHICH THE MOST FASTIDIOUSLY CRITICAL TASTE
AS BEFORE SOME MINUTES ELAPSED ERE A REPLY WAS MADE AND DURING THE INTERVAL THE DYING MAN SEEMED TO BE COLLECTING HIS ENERGIES TO SPEAK AT MY FOURTH REPETITION OF THE QUESTION HE SAID VERY FAINTLY ALMOST INAUDIBLY
STILL THE GENERAL APPEARANCE WAS CERTAINLY NOT THAT OF DEATH AS I APPROACHED M VALDEMAR I MADE A KIND OF HALF EFFORT TO INFLUENCE HIS RIGHT ARM INTO PURSUIT OF MY OWN AS I PASSED THE LATTER GENTLY TO AND FRO ABOVE HIS PERSON
WHAT THE DEVIL'S THE MATTER NOW SAID A SECOND GET OUT O THAT SAID A THIRD WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY YOWLING IN THAT ERE KIND OF STYLE LIKE A CATTYMOUNT SAID A FOURTH AND HEREUPON I WAS SEIZED AND SHAKEN WITHOUT CEREMONY
THE ENCROACHMENTS OF DEATH MIGHT BE ARRESTED BY THE PROCESS THERE WERE OTHER POINTS TO BE ASCERTAINED BUT THESE MOST EXCITED MY CURIOSITY THE LAST IN ESPECIAL FROM THE IMMENSELY IMPORTANT CHARACTER OF ITS CONSEQUENCES
BUT WHEN THE ECHOES HAD FULLY CEASED A LIGHT LAUGHTER AT ONCE PERVADED THE ASSEMBLY THE MUSICIANS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND SMILED AS IF AT THEIR OWN NERVOUSNESS AND FOLLY AND MADE WHISPERING VOWS EACH TO THE OTHER
AND THUS THE WALTZERS PERFORCE CEASED THEIR EVOLUTIONS AND THERE WAS A BRIEF DISCONCERT OF THE WHOLE GAY COMPANY AND WHILE THE CHIMES OF THE CLOCK YET RANG IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE GIDDIEST GREW PALE AND THE MORE AGED AND SEDATE PASSED THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR BROWS AS IF IN CONFUSED REVERIE OR MEDITATION
GREEN GENOESE VELVET THAN ANY THING ELSE IT WAS GRASS CLEARLY BUT GRASS SUCH AS WE SELDOM SEE OUT OF ENGLAND
DISINTER THE BODY AND DISSECT IT AT LEISURE IN PRIVATE ARRANGEMENTS WERE EASILY EFFECTED WITH SOME OF THE NUMEROUS CORPS OF BODY SNATCHERS WITH WHICH LONDON ABOUNDS AND UPON THE THIRD NIGHT AFTER THE FUNERAL
THERE WERE TWO PARTICULARS NEVERTHELESS WHICH I THOUGHT THEN AND STILL THINK MIGHT FAIRLY BE STATED AS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE INTONATION AS WELL ADAPTED TO CONVEY SOME IDEA OF ITS UNEARTHLY PECULIARITY
ONCE TO THE DISSECTION A STUDENT HOWEVER WAS ESPECIALLY DESIROUS OF TESTING A THEORY OF HIS OWN AND INSISTED UPON APPLYING THE BATTERY TO ONE OF THE PECTORAL MUSCLES
THE SUN HAD SCARCELY SHONE STRICTLY SPEAKING DURING THE DAY WHICH NEVERTHELESS HAD BEEN UNPLEASANTLY WARM A SMOKY MIST RESEMBLING THAT OF THE INDIAN SUMMER ENVELOPED ALL THINGS AND OF COURSE ADDED TO MY UNCERTAINTY
FOR WHAT REALLY OCCURRED HOWEVER IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY HUMAN BEING COULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED AS I RAPIDLY MADE THE MESMERIC PASSES AMID EJACULATIONS OF
OH YOU WOULD HAVE LAUGHED TO SEE HOW CUNNINGLY I THRUST IT IN I MOVED IT SLOWLY VERY VERY SLOWLY SO THAT I MIGHT NOT DISTURB THE OLD MAN'S SLEEP IT TOOK ME AN HOUR TO PLACE MY WHOLE HEAD WITHIN THE OPENING
IS NOT THIS A SPECTACLE OF WOE BEHOLD I LOOKED AND THE UNSEEN FIGURE WHICH STILL GRASPED ME BY THE WRIST HAD CAUSED TO BE THROWN OPEN THE GRAVES OF ALL MANKIND AND FROM EACH ISSUED THE FAINT PHOSPHORIC RADIANCE OF DECAY
AND IT WAS HIS OWN GUIDING TASTE WHICH HAD GIVEN CHARACTER TO THE MASQUERADERS
NO BLOOD SPOT WHATEVER I HAD BEEN TOO WARY FOR THAT A TUB HAD CAUGHT ALL HA HA
I DID NOT THINK IT ADVISABLE TO DISTURB HIM FARTHER JUST THEN AND NOTHING MORE WAS SAID OR DONE UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF DOCTOR F WHO CAME A LITTLE BEFORE SUNRISE
FROM MY ORDINARY BIAS OF THOUGHT AND FROM THE DIFFICULTY TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED OF COLLECTING MY SENSES AND ESPECIALLY OF REGAINING MY MEMORY FOR A LONG TIME AFTER AWAKING FROM SLUMBER THE MEN WHO SHOOK ME
PRESENTLY THE MURMUR OF WATER FELL GENTLY UPON MY EAR AND IN A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARD AS I TURNED WITH THE ROAD SOMEWHAT MORE ABRUPTLY THAN HITHERTO I BECAME AWARE THAT A BUILDING OF SOME KIND
THE TORTURES ENDURED HOWEVER WERE INDUBITABLY QUITE EQUAL FOR THE TIME TO THOSE OF ACTUAL SEPULTURE
THERE HAD BEEN A VERY REMARKABLE AND MOST UNACCOUNTABLE OMISSION NO PERSON HAD AS YET BEEN MESMERIZED IN ARTICULO MORTIS IT REMAINED TO BE SEEN FIRST WHETHER
NOT THAT I CARED MUCH ABOUT THE MATTER IF I DID NOT HIT UPON THE VILLAGE BEFORE SUNSET OR EVEN BEFORE DARK IT WAS MORE THAN POSSIBLE THAT A LITTLE DUTCH FARMHOUSE OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND WOULD SOON MAKE ITS APPEARANCE
EVEN TO THE PASSAGE OF A VIRGINIAN MOUNTAIN WAGON THE MOST ASPIRING VEHICLE I TAKE IT OF ITS KIND THE ROAD HOWEVER EXCEPT IN BEING OPEN THROUGH THE WOOD IF
JUST SO TARDILY JUST SO WEARILY JUST SO CHEERILY CAME BACK THE LIGHT OF THE SOUL TO ME APART FROM THE TENDENCY TO TRANCE HOWEVER MY GENERAL HEALTH APPEARED TO BE GOOD NOR COULD I PERCEIVE THAT IT WAS
THE BLACKNESS OF THE ABSOLUTE NIGHT THE SILENCE LIKE A SEA THAT OVERWHELMS THE UNSEEN BUT PALPABLE PRESENCE OF THE CONQUEROR WORM
I MADE UP MY MIND TO TAKE THE LIFE OF THE OLD MAN AND THUS RID MYSELF OF THE EYE FOREVER NOW THIS IS THE POINT YOU FANCY ME MAD MADMEN KNOW NOTHING BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW WISELY I PROCEEDED
KIND OF HALF PRECISE HALF NEGLIGENT AND WHOLLY PICTURESQUE DEFINITION CLUMPS OF WILD FLOWERS GREW EVERYWHERE LUXURIANTLY IN THE INTERSPACES WHAT TO MAKE OF ALL THIS OF COURSE
TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH WALL A TALL AND NARROW GOTHIC WINDOW LOOKED OUT UPON A CLOSED CORRIDOR WHICH PURSUED THE WINDINGS OF THE SUITE THESE WINDOWS WERE OF STAINED GLASS WHOSE COLOR VARIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PREVAILING HUE OF THE DECORATIONS OF THE CHAMBER INTO WHICH IT OPENED
YES IT WAS THIS HE HAD THE EYE OF A VULTURE A PALE BLUE EYE WITH A FILM OVER IT WHENEVER IT FELL UPON ME MY BLOOD RAN COLD AND SO BY DEGREES VERY GRADUALLY
THERE WERE TWELVE YOUNGSTERS AND THEY WERE EXACTLY LIKE THEIR PARENTS ONLY SMALL THEY WERE CLINGING ALL OVER OL MISSUS POSSUM SOME WERE ON HER BACK SOME WERE CLINGING TO HER SIDES
HE IS FOUND ALL OVER THE WEST FROM WELL UP IN THE NORTH TO THE HOT DRY REGIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST WHEN HE CANNOT FIND A CONVENIENT DESERTED BURROW OF SOME OTHER ANIMAL
AND HOW FEARFUL THAT THEIR CURIOSITY WILL NOT BE SATISFIED REMARKED OLD MOTHER NATURE AS I WAS SAYING THIS IS ALL ABOUT OUR NATIVE MICE THAT IS THE MICE WHO BELONG TO THIS COUNTRY
LIKE JOHNNY CHUCK HE GETS VERY FAT BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP NOW NIMBLEHEELS SHOW US HOW YOU CAN JUMP NIMBLEHEELS HOPPED DOWN FROM THE LOG ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SITTING AND AT ONCE SHOT INTO THE AIR IN SUCH A HIGH
IN THAT COUNTRY THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF MOSS IT COVERS THE GROUND JUST AS GRASS DOES HERE BUT THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THESE LEMMINGS IS THE WAY THEY MIGRATE
YOU ARE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE DECLARED CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL I KNOW IT REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK AND SHIVERED AGAIN I KNOW IT I
I CAN FORGIVE THEM FOR THAT EVERY ONE MUST EAT TO LIVE BUT SHADOW HUNTS ME EVEN WHEN HIS STOMACH IS SO FULL HE CANNOT EAT ANOTHER MOUTHFUL THAT FELLOW JUST LOVES TO KILL
MY I WISH I COULD FLY THE WAY HE CAN OLD MOTHER NATURE SHOOK HER HEAD DISAPPROVINGLY JUMPER SAID SHE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR EYES WHEN DID YOU EVER SEE TIMMY FLY
YELLING THAT WAY IS ONE OF YOWLER'S TRICKS EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE HE DOES IT FOR THE SAME REASON HOOTY THE OWL HOOTS HE HOPES THAT IT WILL STARTLE SOME SLEEPER SO THAT THEY WILL MOVE IF THEY DO HIS KEEN EARS ARE SURE TO HEAR IT
WHAT'S YO HURRY PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND LOOKED UP IN THAT TREE THERE PEERING DOWN AT HIM FROM A HOLE HIGH UP IN THE TRUNK WAS A SHARP WHITISH GRAY FACE
BEGAN OLD MOTHER NATURE AS SOON AS EVERYBODY WAS ON HAND THE NEXT MORNING I WOULDN'T BE WITHOUT MY POCKETS FOR ANY THING SPOKE UP STRIPED CHIPMUNK
HE SAID WHY YOU
REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOP UP ON THAT LOG SIDE OF YOUR COUSIN WHITEFOOT WHERE ALL CAN SEE YOU NIMBLEHEELS HOPPED UP BESIDE WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE AND AS THE TWO LITTLE COUSINS SAT SIDE BY SIDE
THEY FORM A GREAT ARMY AND PUSH AHEAD REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING THEY SWIM WIDE RIVERS AND EVEN LAKES WHICH MAY LIE IN THEIR WAY OF COURSE THEY EAT EVERYTHING EATABLE IN THEIR PATH
WHO OF YOU HAS SEEN TIMMY THE FLYING SQUIRREL LATELY I HAVEN'T SAID PETER RABBIT I HAVEN'T SAID STRIPED CHIPMUNK I HAVEN'T SAID HAPPY JACK I HAVEN'T SAID CHATTERER
IT IS A WONDER HE WASN'T LIVING IN FARMER BROWN'S HOUSE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE PROBABLY OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY WERE HE IS PERFECTLY AT HOME IN ANY BUILDING PUT UP BY MAN
AND YOU SAW HIM IN WINTER HE CHANGES HIS COAT ACCORDING TO SEASON JUST AS YOU DO YOURSELF JUMPER IN WINTER HE IS TRAPPED FOR HIS FUR
IN THE SOUTH HE IS QUITE COMMON AND THERE OFTEN STEALS CHICKENS AND TURKEYS EVEN YOUNG PIGS HE PREFERS TO HUNT AT NIGHT BUT SOMETIMES IS SEEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT MISSUS YOWLER'S KITTENS ARE BORN IN A CAVE OR IN A HOLLOW TREE DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE IS AN EXPERT CLIMBER
HE HAD FOUND MY TRACKS WHERE I HAD BEEN GATHERING BEECHNUTS AND HE WAS FOLLOWING THEM WITH HIS NOSE JUST THE WAY BOWSER THE HOUND FOLLOWS REDDY FOX I NEARLY DIED OF FRIGHT WHEN I SAW HIM
WHO ALSO IS RATHER FOND OF THE GREEN MEADOWS I OUGHT TO HAVE SENT WORD TO HIM TO BE HERE THIS MORNING HARDLY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF OLD MOTHER NATURE'S MOUTH WHEN SOMETHING LANDED IN THE LEAVES ALMOST AT HER FEET AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF SCHOOL
ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE I HAVE REPLIED DANNY MEADOW MOUSE ONCE I WAS CARRIED TO FARMER BROWN'S BARN IN A SHOCK OF CORN AND I FOUND NIBBLER LIVING IN THE BARN
TIME IS UP INTERRUPTED OLD MOTHER NATURE
SOMETIMES HOWEVER IF WE CANNOT FIND A PLACE THAT JUST SUITS US WE GO QUITE A DISTANCE ARE YOUR BABIES BORN DOWN IN THAT LITTLE BEDROOM IN THE GROUND ASKED JUMPER THE HARE OF COURSE REPLIED JOHNNY CHUCK
HE GETS INTO SO MUCH MISCHIEF IN THE GRAIN FIELDS AND IN THE ORCHARDS THAT HE IS QUITE AS MUCH DISLIKED AS IS JACK RABBIT THIS PARTICULAR MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IS QUITE AS MUCH AT HOME AMONG ROCKS AND TREE ROOTS AS IN OPEN GROUND
A LITTLE ROUND BALL OF GRASS AND OTHER VEGETABLE MATTER THIS IS PLACED IN THICK GRASS OR WEEDS CLOSE TO THE GROUND OR IN BUSHES OR LOW TREES SEVERAL FEET FROM THE GROUND
FOR HIS SIZE AMONG ALL THE ANIMALS IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY WHEN I SAY THIS I MEAN THE GREATEST GROUND JUMPER
WITH A PAIR OF TWINKLING BLACK EYES HELLO UNC BILLY CRIED PETER HOW ARE YOU AND OL MISSUS POSSUM PO'LY PETER PO'LY
THEN HE WRAPPED THE END OF HIS TAIL AROUND THE BRANCH AND SWUNG HIMSELF OFF KEEPING HOLD OF THE BRANCH ONLY WITH HIS TAIL AND ONE HIND FOOT THEN
IT IS LARGELY BECAUSE OF ROBBER THE RAT AND NIBBLER THAT MEN KEEP THE CATS YOU ALL HATE SO A CAT IS NIBBLER'S WORST ENEMY NIBBLER IS SLENDER AND GRACEFUL
AND ONCE IN A WHILE ONLY ONE BUT THAT ISN'T REALLY SAFE
LARGE ERMINE OR YELLOW BELLIED WEASEL HIS SMALLEST COUSIN IS THE LEAST WEASEL THE LATTER IS NOT MUCH LONGER THAN A MOUSE IN WINTER HE IS ALL WHITE EVEN THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
AGAIN UNC BILLY GRINNED AND THEN PULLED HIMSELF BACK TO THE OTHER BRANCH OLD MOTHER NATURE SHOOK HER HEAD REPROVINGLY UNC BILLY SAID SHE
PETER RABBIT DELIVERED MOTHER NATURE'S MESSAGE TO JOHNNY CHUCK JOHNNY DIDN'T SEEM AT ALL PLEASED HE GRUMBLED AND GROWLED TO HIMSELF HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT HIS RELATIVES
HE WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THINGS AS THEY WERE THE TRUTH IS JOHNNY CHUCK WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GET FAT WITH GOOD LIVING AND HE IS NATURALLY LAZY AS A RULE HE CAN FIND PLENTY TO EAT VERY NEAR HIS HOME
THE SMALLEST OF THE SPINY POCKET MICE IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF NIBBLER THE HOUSE MOUSE AND THE LARGEST IS TWICE AS BIG THEY ARE MORE SLENDER THAN THEIR SILKY COUSINS
AND ON THE PRAIRIES OF THE GREAT WEST HE HAS A SMALLER COUSIN NAMED
HER EYES TWINKLED NIMBLEHEELS SAW THIS AND KNEW THAT SHE WAS ONLY PRETENDING TO BE SEVERE BEFORE HE COULD REPLY JOHNNY CHUCK BEGAN TO CHUCKLE THE CHUCKLE BECAME A LAUGH AND PRESENTLY JOHNNY WAS LAUGHING SO HARD HE HAD TO HOLD HIS SIDES
INSTANTLY DANNY MEADOW MOUSE SCURRIED UNDER A PILE OF DEAD LEAVES WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE DARTED INTO A KNOTHOLE IN THE LOG ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SITTING JUMPER THE HARE DODGED BEHIND A LITTLE HEMLOCK TREE
CRIED PETER RIGHT YOU ARE REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOWEVER DID YOU FIND IT OUT I DIDN'T EXACTLY FIND IT OUT I GUESSED IT REPLIED PETER
IN SUMMER FOOD IS PLENTIFUL AND TUFTY LIVES WELL BUT IN WINDER TUFTY HAS HARD WORK TO GET ENOUGH RARELY DOES HE KNOW WHAT A FULL STOMACH MEANS THEN LIKE HOWLER HE CAN GO A SURPRISING LENGTH OF TIME WITHOUT FOOD AND STILL RETAIN HIS STRENGTH
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN JOHNNY CHUCK CRIED PETER OLD MOTHER NATURE LAUGHED SO I HAVE SAID SHE THAT WILL NEVER DO NEVER IN THE WORLD
DOES HE EAT NUTS LIKE HIS COUSINS ASKED PETER RABBIT HE CERTAINLY DOES REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE ALSO HE EATS GRUBS AND INSECTS HE DEARLY LOVES A FAT BEETLE
IF I COULD CLIMB A TREE LIKE CHATTERER IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT NO IT WOULDN'T
PRINCE HIPPOLYTE WHO HAD BEEN GAZING AT THE VICOMTE FOR SOME TIME THROUGH HIS LORGNETTE SUDDENLY TURNED COMPLETELY ROUND TOWARD THE LITTLE PRINCESS AND HAVING ASKED FOR A NEEDLE
OPENING IN FRONT OVER A WHITE WAISTCOAT SO LONG THAT IT COVERED HIS ROTUND STOMACH WHITE LEATHER BREECHES TIGHTLY FITTING THE FAT THIGHS OF HIS SHORT LEGS AND HESSIAN BOOTS HIS SHORT HAIR HAD EVIDENTLY JUST BEEN BRUSHED
NATASHA KNEW HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HER AND THIS AFFORDED HER PLEASURE SHE EVEN TURNED SO THAT HE SHOULD SEE HER PROFILE IN WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS ITS MOST BECOMING ASPECT BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND ACT PIERRE APPEARED IN THE STALLS
AND WITH THE WISDOM OF AGE UNDERSTOOD
BECOMES AN INSIGNIFICANT USELESS FEEBLE MAN ROSTOPCHIN FELT THIS AND IT WAS THIS WHICH EXASPERATED HIM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE WHOM THE CROWD HAD STOPPED
HE GLANCED AT HER OCCASIONALLY WITH A SLIGHT SMILE HE FANCIED HE SAW SOMETHING PATHETICALLY INNOCENT IN THAT FRIGHTENED SICKLY LITTLE FACE HE DID NOT FIND THE CIVIL SERVANT OR HIS WIFE WHERE HE HAD LEFT THEM
BUT THAT PRINCE BAGRATION WAS WOUNDED KUTUZOV GROANED AND SWAYED HIS HEAD RIDE OVER TO PRINCE PETER IVANOVICH AND FIND OUT ABOUT IT EXACTLY HE SAID TO ONE OF HIS ADJUTANTS AND THEN TURNED TO THE DUKE OF WURTTEMBERG WHO WAS STANDING BEHIND HIM
AND THAT THE VERY IDEAS OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE WERE ARRESTED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT BY NAPOLEON'S CAPRICE THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE GENERAL TEMPER OF THE AGE PRODUCED NAPOLEON'S POWER BUT NAPOLEON'S POWER SUPPRESSED THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION
I HAVE LONG BEEN WAITING FOR YOU THAT FRIGHTENED HAPPY LITTLE GIRL SEEMED TO SAY
SMOLENSK ASKED PRINCESS MARY
AND FELT MORTIFIED BY IT SHE BLUSHED FOR HIM GREW STILL ANGRIER AT HAVING BLUSHED AND LOOKED AT THE PRINCESS WITH A BOLD AND DEFIANT EXPRESSION WHICH SAID
THAT'S ALL RIGHT NO ONE THINKS YOU A COWARD BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT ASK DENISOV WHETHER IT IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR A CADET TO DEMAND SATISFACTION OF HIS REGIMENTAL COMMANDER
AND RETIRED TO HIS APARTMENTS DIRECTLY AFTER DINNER IN THE EVENING WHEN PRINCE ANDREW WENT TO HIM AND TRYING TO ROUSE HIM
HE SPOKE SLOWLY WITH ASSURANCE THAT HE WOULD BE LISTENED TO AND HE LOOKED ONLY AT THE PERSON WITH WHOM HE WAS CONVERSING PRINCE ANDREW FOLLOWED SPERANSKI'S EVERY WORD AND MOVEMENT WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION AS HAPPENS TO SOME PEOPLE
BUT MADE THEM ON THE CONTRARY RUN FARTHER AWAY AMONG THE SOLDIERS IN THE SHOPS AND PASSAGES SOME MEN WERE TO BE SEEN IN GRAY COATS WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN HEADS
AND IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO WEEP OVER THE FATE OF MY FATHERLAND ON RECEIVING THIS DISPATCH THE EMPEROR SENT PRINCE VOLKONSKI TO KUTUZOV WITH THE FOLLOWING RESCRIPT PRINCE MICHAEL ILARIONOVICH SINCE THE TWENTY NINTH OF AUGUST
THAT PRINCESS MARY WAS IN MOSCOW THE DEATH SUFFERINGS AND LAST DAYS OF PRINCE ANDREW HAD OFTEN OCCUPIED PIERRE'S THOUGHTS AND NOW RECURRED TO HIM WITH FRESH VIVIDNESS HAVING HEARD AT DINNER THAT PRINCESS MARY WAS IN MOSCOW AND LIVING IN HER HOUSE
HAVE THEY FED HIM HAVEN'T THEY HURT HIS FEELINGS HE THOUGHT BUT HAVING CAUGHT HIMSELF SAYING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE FLINTS HE WAS NOW AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT I MIGHT ASK HE THOUGHT BUT THEY'LL SAY HE'S A BOY HIMSELF AND SO HE PITIES THE BOY
WHEN MURAT'S ADJUTANT GALLOPED UP WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD BE ROUTED IF HIS MAJESTY WOULD LET HIM HAVE ANOTHER DIVISION REINFORCEMENTS SAID NAPOLEON IN A TONE OF STERN SURPRISE LOOKING AT THE ADJUTANT
IN HISTORY IT IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF PERSONALITY FREE WILL AS WITH ASTRONOMY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE MOTION OF THE EARTH LAY IN ABANDONING THE IMMEDIATE SENSATION OF THE EARTH'S FIXITY
AND THAT THE REAL COURSE OF THE BATTLE IS BETTER KNOWN TO ME THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF THAN TO HIM WOLZOGEN WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A REJOINDER BUT KUTUZOV INTERRUPTED HIM
PIERRE SAW THAT PRINCE ANDREW WAS GOING TO SPEAK OF NATASHA AND HIS BROAD FACE EXPRESSED PITY AND SYMPATHY THIS EXPRESSION IRRITATED PRINCE ANDREW
ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND WENT FOR INTEREST ON DEBTS THE BUILDING OF A NEW CHURCH PREVIOUSLY BEGUN HAD COST ABOUT TEN THOUSAND IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS
DO LET ME INTO THE VERY INTO THE CHIEF
HE SENT FOR ALL HIS STEWARDS TO THE HEAD OFFICE AND EXPLAINED TO THEM HIS INTENTIONS AND WISHES HE TOLD THEM THAT STEPS WOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY TO FREE HIS SERFS AND THAT TILL THEN THEY WERE NOT TO BE OVERBURDENED WITH LABOR
JOINED HIS REGIMENT AND WAS SOON TAKEN AS ORDERLY BY A GENERAL COMMANDING A LARGE GUERRILLA DETACHMENT FROM THE TIME HE RECEIVED HIS COMMISSION AND ESPECIALLY SINCE HE HAD JOINED THE ACTIVE ARMY AND TAKEN PART IN THE BATTLE OF VYAZMA PETYA HAD BEEN IN
THE OFFICER WALKED ABOUT THE YARD GAZING AT HIS WORN OUT BOOTS WITH LOWERED HEAD AND A FAINT SMILE ON HIS LIPS
AND BERG AND VERA IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR EVENING PARTY INTERRUPTING EACH OTHER IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ENTERTAIN THEIR GUEST VERA HAVING DECIDED IN HER OWN MIND
IN FRONT OF THEM ROWS OF GRAY CLOAKS WERE ALREADY VISIBLE THROUGH THE SMOKE AND AN OFFICER CATCHING SIGHT OF BAGRATION RUSHED SHOUTING AFTER THE CROWD OF RETREATING SOLDIERS ORDERING THEM BACK
THOUGHT ROSTOV WHO HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE ALEXANDER LODGED SADDLED HORSES WERE STANDING BEFORE THE HOUSE
BUT THE EMPEROR TURNED FROM HIM TOOK A COUPLE OF STEPS STOPPED CAME BACK AND CALLED BERTHIER WE MUST GIVE RESERVES HE SAID MOVING HIS ARMS SLIGHTLY APART WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE SENT THERE HE ASKED OF BERTHIER WHOM HE SUBSEQUENTLY TERMED
A THIN YOUNG LAD AN HUSSAR OF THE LIFE GUARDS WHO HAD BEEN LOSING THAT EVENING CLIMBED ON THE WINDOW SILL LEANED OVER AND LOOKED DOWN OH OH OH HE MUTTERED
THAT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT WAS AN ADVANCED POST WHEREAS IN REALITY IT WAS SIMPLY A FORTIFIED POINT ON THE LEFT FLANK AND THAT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WAS FOUGHT BY US ON AN ENTRENCHED POSITION PREVIOUSLY SELECTED WHERE
PRINCE ANDREW KILLED THAT OLD MAN SIMPLICITY IS SUBMISSION TO GOD SUFFERING IS NECESSARY THE MEANING OF ALL ONE MUST HARNESS MY WIFE IS GETTING MARRIED ONE MUST FORGET AND UNDERSTAND
AND THAT THE ITALIAN'S CURE CONSISTED IN REMOVING SUCH INCONVENIENCE BUT IN ANNA PAVLOVNA'S PRESENCE NO ONE DARED TO THINK OF THIS OR EVEN APPEAR TO KNOW IT THEY SAY THE POOR COUNTESS IS VERY ILL THE DOCTOR SAYS IT IS ANGINA PECTORIS ANGINA OH THAT'S A TERRIBLE ILLNESS
TO MAKE THEM RUN FREELY AND PETYA ADORED HER ABOVE ALL THEY WERE GAY BECAUSE THERE WAS A WAR NEAR MOSCOW THERE WOULD BE FIGHTING AT THE TOWN GATES ARMS WERE BEING GIVEN OUT
AFTER A SHORT SILENCE THE COUNTESS SPOKE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME NO ONE REPLIED SOON AFTER THAT NATASHA HEARD HER MOTHER'S EVEN BREATHING NATASHA DID NOT MOVE THOUGH HER LITTLE BARE FOOT
HE MANAGES EVERYTHING I'LL SPEAK TO HIM HE HAS PROMISED TO COME THIS EVENING WHAT HAS SPERANSKI TO DO WITH THE ARMY REGULATIONS ASKED PRINCE ANDREW
WHICH DROVE INTO THE SQUARE ATTENDED BY TWO MOUNTED DRAGOONS
THE NEARER THEY GOT TO THE HOLLOW THE LESS THEY COULD SEE BUT THE MORE THEY FELT THE NEARNESS OF THE ACTUAL BATTLEFIELD THEY BEGAN TO MEET WOUNDED MEN ONE WITH A BLEEDING HEAD AND NO CAP WAS BEING DRAGGED ALONG BY TWO SOLDIERS
HER FACE ASSUMED A SERIOUS EXPRESSION AND SHE SAT SILENT SHE SAT A LONG TIME LOOKING AT THE RECEDING LINE OF CANDLES REFLECTED IN THE GLASSES AND EXPECTING FROM TALES SHE HAD HEARD TO SEE A COFFIN OR HIM PRINCE ANDREW
JUDGING BY HIS FIRST MOVEMENTS AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING ALL THESE COURTIERS PFUEL PROPOSES ARMFELDT DISPUTES BENNIGSEN CONSIDERS AND BARCLAY CALLED ON TO ACT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DECIDE ON AND TIME PASSES BRINGING NO RESULT
YOU SPEAK TO THE COLONEL ABOUT THIS NASTY BUSINESS BEFORE OTHER OFFICERS CONTINUED THE STAFF CAPTAIN AND BOGDANICH THE COLONEL WAS CALLED BOGDANICH SHUTS YOU UP HE DID NOT SHUT ME UP
KEEP THE LAW THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS THERE FOR AM I NOT RIGHT GOOD CHRISTIANS
STANDING NEAR NAPOLEON EXCHANGED LOOKS AND SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY AT THIS GENERAL'S SENSELESS OFFER NAPOLEON BOWED HIS HEAD AND REMAINED SILENT A LONG TIME AT EIGHT HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM FRANCE I WILL NOT HAVE MY GUARD DESTROYED
GIVE ME FIVE HUNDWED MEN AND I WILL BWEAK THE LINE THAT'S CERTAIN THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY GUEWILLA WARFARE DENISOV ROSE AND BEGAN GESTICULATING AS HE EXPLAINED HIS PLAN TO BOLKONSKI
PERSONS WHOSE GRATITUDE MIGHT BE USEFUL IN THE EVENT OF A COUNTERREVOLUTION
PROBABLY MADE UP THE ARMY TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE THREE THOUSAND MEN
BUT THAT ANARCHY NOWHERE LASTED LONGER THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS FROM THE DAY ON WHICH WILLIAM REACHED SAINT JAMES'S NOT EVEN THE MOST UNPOPULAR AGENTS OF THE FALLEN GOVERNMENT NOT EVEN THE MINISTERS OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
HE DID NOT ENVY YOUNGER MEN THE HONOUR OF LIVING ON POTATOES AND WHISKEY AMONG THE IRISH BOGS HE WOULD TRY TO CONSOLE HIMSELF WITH PARTRIDGES WITH CHAMPAGNE AND WITH THE SOCIETY OF THE WITTIEST MEN AND PRETTIEST WOMEN OF PARIS IT WAS RUMOURED HOWEVER
FROM THE ORDINARY METHODS PRESCRIBED BY THE LAW THE CONVENTION WHICH MET AT WESTMINSTER THOUGH SUMMONED BY IRREGULAR WRITS WAS CONSTITUTED ON THE EXACT MODEL OF A REGULAR PARLIAMENT NO MAN WAS INVITED TO THE UPPER HOUSE
AND HAD THEN RUN AWAY FOR FEAR OF BEING UNDER THE NECESSITY OF JOINING EITHER NOR WAS IT VERY EASY TO SAY
THE TWO BILLS HAD A COMMON ORIGIN AND TO A GREAT EXTENT A COMMON OBJECT THEY WERE FRAMED AT THE SAME TIME AND LAID ASIDE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SANK TOGETHER INTO OBLIVION
MORE UNMANAGEABLE THAN WILLIAM DURING THIS SESSION FOUND THE PARLIAMENT AT EDINBURGH BUT IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF THE PARLIAMENT AT EDINBURGH TO PUT ON WILLIAM SUCH A PRESSURE AS THE PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER HAD PUT ON CHARLES
HIS GOWN WAS TORN TO SHREDS OVER HIS HEAD IF HE HAD A PRAYER BOOK IN HIS POCKET IT WAS BURNED AND HE WAS DISMISSED WITH A CHARGE NEVER AS HE VALUED HIS LIFE
IN THIS MEETING IT WAS DETERMINED THAT FOR THE FUTURE THE EJECTION OF THE ESTABLISHED CLERGY
HE WAS BELIEVED BY MANY TO BE AN INSINCERE APOSTATE
AND THOSE WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS TO KEEP THE COMMUNICATIONS CLEAR WERE EXAGGERATED WITH ALL THE ARTIFICES OF RHETORIC ONE OF THE ALIEN MERCENARIES HAD BACKED HIS HORSE AGAINST AN HONEST CITIZEN WHO PRESSED FORWARD TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE ROYAL CANOPY
AND ALMOST THE ONLY PROTESTANT WHO STILL HELD A GREAT PLACE IN IRELAND STRUGGLED COURAGEOUSLY IN THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE AND ORDER AGAINST THE UNITED STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POPULACE AT THE WICKLOW ASSIZES OF THAT SPRING
INDEED THOSE WHO LAID OUT THE CITY HAD NEVER MEANT THAT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAND A REGULAR SIEGE
HAD ANY THING TO FEAR FROM THE FURY OF THE POPULACE
OF KILLIECRANKIE AT PRESENT A HIGHWAY AS SMOOTH AS ANY ROAD IN MIDDLESEX
BUT WERE BROKEN AND SCATTERED THEN THE FLIGHT BECAME WILD AND TUMULTUOUS THE FUGITIVES BROKE DOWN THE BRIDGES AND BURNED THE FERRYBOATS WHOLE TOWNS THE SEATS OF THE PROTESTANT POPULATION
WOULD NOT NOW SATISFY EVEN ONE HALF OF THE NONCONFORMISTS AND IT WAS THE OBVIOUS INTEREST OF EVERY NONCONFORMIST WHOM NO CONCESSION WOULD SATISFY THAT NONE OF HIS BRETHREN SHOULD BE SATISFIED THE MORE LIBERAL THE TERMS OF COMPREHENSION
THOUGH IT HAD BROUGHT GREAT CALAMITIES BOTH ON THE HOUSE OF STUART AND ON THE HOUSE OF BOURBON HAD BEEN BY NO MEANS UNPROFITABLE TO HIMSELF HE WAS OLD HE SAID HE WAS FAT
THE AGENT OF FRANCE IN THAT KINGDOM MUST BE EQUAL TO MUCH MORE THAN THE ORDINARY FUNCTIONS OF AN ENVOY IT WOULD BE HIS RIGHT AND HIS DUTY TO OFFER ADVICE TOUCHING EVERY PART OF THE POLITICAL AND MILITARY ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNTRY
WHO THRICE FLUNG DOWN HIS GLOVE ON THE PAVEMENT AND THRICE DEFIED TO MORTAL COMBAT THE FALSE TRAITOR WHO SHOULD GAINSAY THE TITLE OF WILLIAM AND MARY AMONG THE NOBLE DAMSELS WHO SUPPORTED THE GORGEOUS TRAIN OF THE QUEEN WAS HER BEAUTIFUL AND GENTLE COUSIN THE LADY HENRIETTA HYDE WHOSE FATHER ROCHESTER
THE UNJUST AND ABSURD ACT OF INCAPACITATION WAS CARRIED BY SEVENTY FOUR VOICES TO TWENTY FOUR ANOTHER VOTE STILL MORE OBVIOUSLY AIMED AT THE HOUSE OF STAIR SPEEDILY FOLLOWED
THE BEST THING THAT THE TWO REGIMENTS COULD DO WOULD BE TO SAIL BACK TO ENGLAND HE MEANT HE SAID TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF PRIVATELY AND THE INHABITANTS MUST THEN TRY TO MAKE GOOD TERMS FOR THEMSELVES
TO WHOSE ADVICE HE MAY HAVE RECOURSE WILL SET HIS MIND AT EASE BUT IF THIS RIDER SHOULD PASS IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY THAT THE CORONATION OATH IS MEANT TO PREVENT THE KING FROM GIVING HIS ASSENT TO BILLS WHICH MAY BE PRESENTED TO HIM BY THE LORDS AND COMMONS
INCOMPETENT AS HE WAS HE BORE A COMMISSION WHICH GAVE HIM MILITARY RANK IN SCOTLAND NEXT TO DUNDEE
THE LEADERS OF THE CLUB WERE NOT TO BE SO DRAWN AWAY FROM THEIR OBJECT IT WAS MOVED AND RESOLVED THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS SHOULD BE POSTPONED TILL SECULAR AFFAIRS HAD BEEN SETTLED
HIS GRAVE AND ELOQUENT DISCOURSE WAS POLLUTED NEITHER BY ADULATION NOR BY MALIGNITY
THE ROADS WERE SO BAD AND THE HORSES SO WEAK
THE FIRST QUESTION TO BE DECIDED WAS WHETHER JAMES SHOULD REMAIN AT DUBLIN OR SHOULD PUT HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMY IN ULSTER ON THIS QUESTION THE IRISH AND BRITISH FACTIONS JOINED BATTLE REASONS OF NO GREAT WEIGHT WERE ADDUCED ON BOTH SIDES FOR NEITHER PARTY VENTURED TO SPEAK OUT
EARL OF PORTLAND MORDAUNT WAS MADE EARL OF MONMOUTH NOT WITHOUT SOME MURMURING ON THE PART OF OLD EXCLUSIONISTS WHO STILL REMEMBERED WITH FONDNESS THEIR PROTESTANT DUKE AND WHO HAD HOPED THAT HIS ATTAINDER WOULD BE REVERSED AND THAT HIS TITLE WOULD BE BORNE BY HIS DESCENDANTS
THAT THE WEAPONS BY WHICH THE HIGHLANDERS COULD BE MOST EFFECTUALLY SUBDUED WERE THE PICKAXE AND THE SPADE THE COUNTRY WHICH LAY JUST ABOVE THIS PASS WAS NOW THE THEATRE OF A WAR SUCH AS THE HIGHLANDS HAD NOT OFTEN WITNESSED
IN WHICH HE WOULD REPRESENT THE MOST POWERFUL AND THE MOST BENEFICENT OF ALLIES BARILLON WAS THEREFORE PASSED OVER HE AFFECTED TO BEAR HIS DISGRACE WITH COMPOSURE
THE MAJORITY PREFERRED THE FORMER PHRASE THE LATTER PHRASE WAS PREFERRED BY THOSE WHIGS WHO WERE FOR A COMPREHENSION BUT IT WAS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED THAT THE TWO PHRASES REALLY MEANT THE SAME THING AND THAT THE OATH HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE WORDED WOULD BIND THE SOVEREIGN IN HIS EXECUTIVE CAPACITY ONLY
SOMETIMES BEATEN SOMETIMES DUCKED HIS FURNITURE WAS THROWN OUT OF THE WINDOWS HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN TURNED OUT OF DOORS IN THE SNOW HE WAS THEN CARRIED TO THE MARKET PLACE AND EXPOSED DURING SOME TIME AS A MALEFACTOR
THE PURITAN WHO WAS IN GENERAL BUT TOO READY TO FOLLOW PRECEDENTS AND ANALOGIES DRAWN FROM THE HISTORY AND JURISPRUDENCE OF THE JEWS MIGHT HAVE FOUND IN THE OLD TESTAMENT QUITE AS CLEAR WARRANT FOR KEEPING FESTIVALS IN HONOUR OF GREAT EVENTS
FROM OTHER COUNTRY SEATS OF THE ARISTOCRACY THE OLD BUILDING WAS A LOFTY TOWER OF RUDE ARCHITECTURE
MELFORT WAS IN A SINGULARLY UNFORTUNATE POSITION HE WAS A RENEGADE HE WAS A MORTAL ENEMY OF THE LIBERTIES OF HIS COUNTRY HE WAS OF A BAD AND TYRANNICAL NATURE AND YET HE WAS IN SOME SENSE A PATRIOT
THE CHURCH ESTABLISHED BY LAW WAS THE MOST ODIOUS INSTITUTION IN THE REALM THE TRIBUNALS HAD PRONOUNCED SOME SENTENCES SO FLAGITIOUS THE PARLIAMENT HAD PASSED SOME ACTS SO OPPRESSIVE THAT UNLESS THOSE SENTENCES AND THOSE ACTS WERE TREATED AS NULLITIES
HIS HEALTH AND SPIRITS FAILED AND HE TRIED TO FIND CONSOLATION IN RELIGIOUS DUTIES SOME PEOPLE WERE MUCH EDIFIED BY THE PIETY OF THE OLD VOLUPTUARY
IN THE MIDST OF THAT FEARFUL ANARCHY TO UPHOLD THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW PRIESTS AND MILITARY CHIEFS APPEARED ON THE BENCH FOR THE PURPOSE OF OVERAWING THE JUDGE AND COUNTENANCING THE ROBBERS
IF HIS COUNSELS WERE BLINDLY FOLLOWED BRING GREAT CALAMITIES ON FRANCE
ONE OF THEM WAS COMMANDED BY LORD KENMORE THE OTHER WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED ON THE BORDER AND WHICH IS STILL STYLED THE KING'S OWN BORDERERS BY LORD LEVEN TWO TROOPS OF HORSE LORD ANNANDALE'S AND LORD BELHAVEN'S
AND NONE WHO HAD STUDIED THE NEW TESTAMENT COULD HAVE FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT WHILE WE ARE CHARGED CAREFULLY TO AVOID WHATEVER MAY GIVE SCANDAL TO THE FEEBLE WE ARE TAUGHT BY DIVINE PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE TO MAKE NO CONCESSION TO THE SUPERCILIOUS
THE CLERGY OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH WERE TO USE THE PHRASE THEN COMMON RABBLED THE MORNING OF CHRISTMAS DAY WAS FIXED FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THESE OUTRAGES FOR NOTHING DISGUSTED THE RIGID COVENANTER
BELONGED TO HIS STEWARD OR TO HIS HEIR APPARENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY POST IN ATHOL WAS BLAIR CASTLE THE HOUSE WHICH NOW BEARS THAT NAME IS NOT DISTINGUISHED BY ANY STRIKING PECULIARITY
TO SEND THEIR MEN AT ONCE TO MY HOUSE TO MAKE SEARCH THEREIN I THOUGHT THE THING IMPOSSIBLE UNDER THE SHELTER OF A FOREIGN AMBASSADOR AND INSTEAD OF TAKING THE USUAL PRECAUTIONS I WAITED THE APPROACH OF THE MEN AT ARMS ONLY PUTTING MY MONEY IN A PLACE OF SAFETY
IN SPITE OF ALL HER HONESTY WAS THE PRIME MANAGER OF IT I KNEW THAT SHE WOULD CARRY IT ON WITH SUCH DELICATE SKILL THAT I SHOULD NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF IT ALTHOUGH I DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO SHEW MORE COMPLIANCE THAN WAS STRICTLY JUST
HAPPENING TO BE SEATED NEXT TO AN ABBE FROM BOLOGNA AT THE THEATRE I ASKED HIM SEVERAL QUESTIONS RESPECTING THE FAMILY OF MY UNFORTUNATE PROTEGEE THE ABBE BEING INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
AND THE FOLLOWING NIGHT I ALLOWED HIM TO COME INTO MY ROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW UNDER WHICH HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF CONVERSING WITH ME I CONSENTED TO BE GUILTY OF A CRIME WHICH I BELIEVED WOULD BE ATONED FOR WITHIN THREE DAYS AND HE LEFT ME
AND I COMPLETED HIS HAPPINESS BY TELLING HIM THAT NOTHING HINDERED ME FROM GOING BACK TO MY NATIVE CITY HE IMMEDIATELY MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO TO MODENA IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN TO HIS PUPIL HOW HE WAS TO ACT IN VENICE
I WAS IN ECSTACY I ENTREATED HER TO SING AFTER SOME LITTLE CEREMONY
THIS LETTER PIQUED MY CURIOSITY AND I EVEN IMAGINED THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN IT IN CONCERT WITH THE ABBE THINKING THAT THEY WANTED TO DUPE ME AND BESIDES FINDING THE PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE RIDICULOUS I DETERMINED ON HAVING MY REVENGE
THAT WISH OF YOURS TO GIVE ME UP YOUR PLACE WHEN YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS HAPPY WITH M M AROSE FROM YOUR FRIENDSHIP RATHER THAN FROM YOUR LOVE AND FOR THE PRESENT I MUST BE GLAD TO SEE THAT YOUR FRIENDSHIP IS STRONGER THAN YOUR LOVE
PERHAPS WAS MORE SENSIBLE THAN I WAS TO THE LOSSES MADE IN GAMBLING IT IS BECAUSE I HAD IN ME THE EVIL SPIRIT OF AVARICE IT IS BECAUSE I LOVED PRODIGALITY
I SEE IN IT ONLY A MARK OF CONTEMPT A GRATUITOUS INSULT MY SELF LOVE TRIED HARD TO IMAGINE SOME REASON LIKELY TO DISPROVE THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT CONTEMPT BUT IN VAIN
SUCH AS YOU ARE TO DECEIVE DE LA HAYE GOD FORBID I SHOULD DECEIVE ANYONE DE LA HAYE IS PERFECTLY WELL AWARE OF MY SYSTEM AND OF MY WAY OF THINKING ON RELIGIOUS MATTERS BUT BEING HIMSELF VERY DEVOUT
WELL TWO DAYS AGO MY DEAR FRIEND BEGGED THE ABBESS AND MY AUNT TO ALLOW ME TO SLEEP IN HER ROOM IN THE PLACE OF THE LAY SISTER WHO HAVING A VERY BAD COLD HAD CARRIED HER COUGH TO THE INFIRMARY
AND MORE THAN ALL YOUR CANDOUR THE STAMP OF TRUTH WAS SO WELL AFFIXED TO THE FIRST WORDS YOU UTTERED THAT I COULD NOT HAVE THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT LEFT IN ME AS TO YOUR BEING THE UNHAPPY VICTIM OF THE MOST NATURAL OF ALL FEELINGS AND AS TO YOUR HAVING ABANDONED YOUR HOME THROUGH A SENTIMENT OF HONOUR
I ADDED THAT I WOULD BE IN THE CHURCH ON THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY TO RECEIVE HER ANSWER I DID NOT FORGET MY APPOINTMENT AND HER ANSWER WAS THAT THE ABBE BEING HER TYRANT SHE WOULD CONSIDER HERSELF HAPPY TO ESCAPE OUT OF HIS CLUTCHES
THUS DID I WITTINGLY DEPRIVE MYSELF OF THE POWER OF DRAWING BACK BUT I WAS ABLE TO REALIZE THE FULL FORCE OF THE SITUATION
WHO WAS AN ARRANT HYPOCRITE IN SPITE OF THE CHARACTER OF HOLINESS WHICH HE ASSUMED AND WHICH HE COULD PLAY WITH SUCH MARVELLOUS ABILITY FROM THAT MOMENT I FELL AGAIN INTO ALL MY FORMER PRACTICES BUT LET US RETURN TO DE LA HAYE
PARTICULARLY TOWARDS A PERSON WHO IS NOT TAINTED BY THAT BASE PASSION AND HAS PROVED IT THE NEXT DAY HAVING GONE EARLY TO THE CASINO I FOUND THE AMBASSADOR ALREADY THERE AND HE WELCOMED ME IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER
THE NEXT DAY ZAWOISKI CALLED ON ME VERY EARLY TO TELL ME THAT I HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO SUPPER AND THAT COUNT RINALDI HAD PRAISED MY PROMPTNESS IN PAYING MY DEBTS OF HONOUR I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO UNDECEIVE HIM
I I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF SUCH A THING EVEN IF DEATH HAD STARED ME IN THE FACE THEN HOW DID YOU COME HERE HOW DID YOUR FRIEND CONTRIVE TO DISCOVER EVERYTHING
BUT IN VAIN OH WHAT A CRUEL LONG NIGHT IT WAS IN THE MORNING I HEARD THAT THE MONSTER HAD GONE AWAY WITH HIS SERVANT ONE HOUR AFTER SEALING MY SHAME YOU MAY IMAGINE MY DESPAIR I ADOPTED THE ONLY PLAN THAT DESPAIR COULD SUGGEST
AND WISHING TO SCREEN HERSELF FROM ALL RESPONSIBILITY SHE HAD LOST NO TIME IN WRITING TO ME THAT SHE WOULD CAUSE THE PROJECTED SUPPER TO BE ABANDONED IN CASE I SHOULD DISAPPROVE OF IT BUT SHE KNEW VERY WELL THAT I WOULD NOT ACCEPT HER OFFER
I WOULD FAIL IN WHAT I OWED TO MYSELF AND I THOUGHT THAT I WAS BOUND IN HONOUR NOT TO LEND MYSELF TO THE IMPOSITION BESIDES WITHOUT EXACTLY REALIZING THAT FEELING I WAS NOT SORRY TO HAVE IT IN MY POWER TO REPROACH M M WITH AN INDIFFERENCE VERY STRANGE IN A WOMAN
TO MORROW WE SHALL DINE IN VENICE AND I UNDERTAKE TO DEFRAY ALL EXPENSES WE ARRIVED IN VENICE THE NEXT DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK AND I TOOK THE TWO WOMEN TO CASTELLO TO A HOUSE THE FIRST FLOOR OF WHICH WAS EMPTY
I WAS THE ONLY GENTLEMAN I WAS TAKING CARE OF TWO LADIES IN THE MIDST OF THE CROWD AND THE WITTY MARQUISE WAS WALKING IN FRONT OF US
BELIEVE ME DEAREST I AM SICK FROM UNHAPPINESS I LOVE YOU WITH MY WHOLE SOUL BUT I AM IN SUCH A SITUATION THAT WHAT YOU ARE WEEPING MY LOVE OH I ENTREAT YOU SPARE MY HEART I AM SO SORRY TO HAVE TOLD YOU SUCH A THING
SHE WISHED TO MAKE US HAPPY AND I CANNOT BE ANGRY WITH HER FOR IT YOU ARE RIGHT TO THINK SO DEAREST BUT MY POSITION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM YOURS YOU HAVE NOT ANOTHER LOVER YOU COULD NOT HAVE ANOTHER BUT I BEING FREE AND UNABLE TO SEE YOU
THE BLOOD LETTING DID ME GOOD AS IT MADE ME SLEEP AND RELIEVED ME OF THE SPASMS WITH WHICH I WAS SOMETIMES TROUBLED
SHE LOOKED AT ME SMILING AND I COULD EASILY UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF HER SOUL BY WHICH SHE WISHED TO TELL ME THAT SHE FELT PERFECTLY WELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SOCIETY IN WHICH SHE WAS THEN
A DIFFICULT TASK IN A PLACE WHERE ALL COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD WAS FORBIDDEN
FOR HE IS MY COUSIN ALTHOUGH ONLY IN THE FOURTH DEGREE AND WHAT IS MORE HE IS A PRIEST AND SAYS THE MASS EVERY DAY YOU MAKE ME LAUGH MY GOOD WOMAN EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT A PRIEST SAYS THE MASS WITHOUT DEPRIVING HIMSELF OF CERTAIN TRIFLING ENJOYMENTS
BIG FELLOWS WHOM YOU CALL IN PARIS SAVOYARDS ALTHOUGH VERY OFTEN THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN IN SAVOY HER HUSBAND CAME IN AT THAT MOMENT AND SHE LOST NO TIME IN RELATING THE WHOLE OF OUR CONVERSATION HE LAUGHED HEARTILY BUT HE SAID I WAS RIGHT HER NIECE ARRIVED A FEW MINUTES AFTER
AND I PRESENTED HIM TO MY PROTECTOR WHO PROMISED HIM HIS VOTE BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE I AM GOING TO RELATE PREVENTED HIM FROM FULFILLING HIS PROMISE
I WAS BOUND IN HONOUR TO PAY THE NEXT MORNING AND I DID NOT POSSESS A GROAT LOVE INCREASED MY DESPAIR FOR I SAW MYSELF ON THE POINT OF LOSING THE ESTEEM OF A WOMAN BY WHOM I WAS SMITTEN
I EXPECTED YOUR LETTER MY BEST BELOVED AND YOU CANNOT DOUBT IT BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW ME THOROUGHLY YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT I KNOW YOU AS WELL YES I KNOW YOUR MIND
IT IS MUCH BETTER STILL TO AVOID THAT FATAL IMPOSSIBILITY BY NEVER PLAYING OTHERWISE THAN WITH MONEY IN HAND NO DOUBT OF IT FOR THEN YOU WILL SAVE BOTH YOUR HONOUR AND YOUR PURSE BUT AS YOU ARE FOND OF GAMES OF CHANCE I ADVISE YOU NEVER TO PUNT
PIECES OF CARDBOARD UNCUT PENS AND CLEWS OF PACK THREAD THE OTHER WAS FASTENED DOWN A PIECE OF POLISHED BLACK MARBLE AN INCH THICK SIX INCHES LONG AND THREE BROAD ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION AND I POSSESSED MYSELF OF IT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH IT
SHE WAS FIT IN EVERY WAY TO BECOME HIS WIFE AND THE HIGHEST FAMILIES OF FRANCE DID NOT THINK THAT SHE NEEDED THE TITLE OF LADY ALBEMARLE TO BE RECEIVED WITH DISTINCTION NO LADY CONSIDERED IT DEBASING TO SIT NEAR HER ALTHOUGH SHE WAS WELL KNOWN AS THE MISTRESS OF THE ENGLISH LORD
I TOOK POSSESSION OF IT AND HAVING HIDDEN IT UNDER MY DRESSING GOWN I CONVEYED IT INTO MY CELL AS SOON AS I WAS ALONE I TOOK THE PIECE OF BLACK MARBLE AND I FOUND THAT I HAD TO MY HAND AN EXCELLENT WHETSTONE FOR BY RUBBING THE BAR WITH THE STONE I OBTAINED A VERY GOOD EDGE
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE EVER CAME FROM THERE HE HAD KEPT ME GOOD COMPANY AND THIS I DISCOVERED AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE FOR IN A FEW DAYS I BECAME AS MELANCHOLY AS BEFORE FORTUNATELY I WAS STILL ALLOWED MY WALK IN THE GARRET AND I BEGAN TO EXAMINE ITS CONTENTS WITH MORE MINUTENESS
MY FATHER WHO WAS A COACHMAN KEPT ME AT SCHOOL TILL I WAS ELEVEN BY WHICH TIME I HAD LEARNT TO READ AND WRITE I WAS AFTERWARDS APPRENTICED TO A BARBER
NOT HAVING GIVEN ME ANYTHING FOR ONE YEAR HAD RELIGIOUSLY PUT TOGETHER EVERY MONTH THE SUM HE HAD ALLOWED ME I NEED NOT SAY HOW PLEASED THE WORTHY FRIENDS WERE WHEN THEY SAW THAT I HAD ENTIRELY GIVEN UP GAMBLING
AMONG THE PIECES OF FURNITURE ON THE FLOOR I SAW A WARMING PAN A KETTLE A FIRE SHOVEL A PAIR OF TONGS SOME OLD CANDLE STICKS SOME EARTHENWARE POTS AND EVEN A SYRINGE
I TOLD HER UNSPARINGLY THAT STEFFANI HAD SEDUCED AND ABANDONED HER OF MALICE AFORETHOUGHT AND THAT SHE OUGHT TO THINK OF HIM ONLY TO BE REVENGED OF HIS PERFIDY MY WORDS MADE HER SHUDDER AND SHE BURIED HER BEAUTIFUL FACE IN HER HANDS WE REACHED THE WIDOW'S HOUSE
WHEN I SEE WHAT THE SAME NATION IS DOING AGAINST THE KING THE PEOPLE WANT TO BE FREE IT IS A NOBLE AMBITION FOR MANKIND ARE NOT MADE TO BE THE SLAVES OF ONE MAN BUT WITH A NATION POPULOUS GREAT WITTY AND GIDDY WHAT WILL BE THE END OF THAT REVOLUTION
BUT WHAT INTERESTED ME MOST WAS A STRAIGHT IRON BAR AS THICK AS MY THUMB AND ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF LONG HOWEVER I LEFT EVERYTHING AS IT WAS AS MY PLANS HAD NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY RIPENED BY TIME FOR ME TO APPROPRIATE ANY OBJECT IN PARTICULAR
HAS WRONGFULLY SQUANDERED MY MONEY AND UNLAWFULLY EATEN MY BREAD SHALL PACK THAT HE ABANDON FOR EVER THE NAME HE HAS USURPED KEEP HIMSELF FROM MY SIGHT AND NEVER SET FOOT AGAIN IN HOUSE OF MINE
AND THAT THE OLD HERO WAS FORGING ARMS FOR A DEMIGOD BLUNT TURNED PALE IT'S NO MORTAL HE WHISPERED LET'S GO BACK AND WHAT WILL MADAM SAY RETURNED DARE DEVIL WILL STAPLES WHO WOULD HAVE PLUNGED INTO MOUNT EREBUS HAD HE BEEN PAID FOR IT
FELL PINIONED AS HE WAS HE COULD NOT RISE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AND RUSSEN PULLED HIM ROUGHLY TO HIS FEET WITH A COARSE LAUGH IN HIS PRESENT FRAME OF MIND THAT LAUGH GALLED HIM WORSE THAN HIS BONDS
AND BEHIND THE HOWITZER BACKED UP BY AN ARRAY OF BROWN MUSKET BARRELS
THE LIGHT WAS LAMBENT AND UNCERTAIN NOW SINKING ALMOST INTO INSIGNIFICANCE AND NOW LEAPING UP WITH A FIERCENESS THAT CAUSED A DEEP GLOW TO THROB IN THE VERY HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN SOMETIMES A BLACK FIGURE WOULD PASS ACROSS THIS GIGANTIC FURNACE MOUTH
DURING THAT TIME HE STATED THAT HIS NAME WAS COX THAT HE HAD ESCAPED FROM PORT ARTHUR WITH EIGHT OTHERS THAT JOHN REX WAS THE LEADER OF THE EXPEDITION THAT THE OTHERS WERE ALL DROWNED AND THAT HE BELIEVED JOHN REX HAD BEEN RETAKEN HAVING PLACED BLUNT IN POSSESSION OF THESE PARTICULARS
IT SEEMED THAT THERE WAS SOMEBODY WITH HIM FOR A KIND THOUGH SOMEWHAT POMPOUS VOICE REMARKED UPON THE SCANTINESS OF ACCOMMODATION AND THE NECESSITY THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF COMPLYING WITH THE KING'S REGULATIONS
THE WOMAN WHO HELD IN HER HANDS THE TWO ENDS OF THE CHAIN THAT WOULD PRODUCE THIS SPARK PAUSED CAME UP UPON DECK AND AFTER A GLANCE ROUND LEANT AGAINST THE POOP RAILING AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE BARRICADE
BUT WHAT CAN ONE DO COME LET US GET ON DECK SAID VICKERS WITH A SHUDDER OF DISGUST RUFUS DAWES FELT THE SWEAT BREAK OUT INTO BEADS ON HIS FOREHEAD THEY SUSPECTED NOTHING THEY WERE GOING AWAY HE MUST WARN THEM
WITH A STRONG EFFORT SHE DISPELLED THE DIZZINESS THAT HAD ALMOST OVERPOWERED HER AND HELD HERSELF ERECT IT WOULD NEVER DO TO BREAK DOWN NOW THE DOOR OPENED AND MAURICE FRERE DREW HER INTO THE CABIN SO YOU HAVE COME SAID HE
IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK AND THE RELIEF GUARD WAS COMING FROM THE AFTER DECK THE CROWD OF PRISONERS ROUND THE DOOR HELD THEIR BREATH TO LISTEN IT'S ALL PLANNED SAYS GABBETT IN A LOW GROWL
DISPOSED IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE DAY BEFORE EVEN MISTER MAURICE FRERE RECOVERED FROM HIS MIDNIGHT FATIGUES WAS LOUNGING ON THE SAME COIL OF ROPE IN PRECISELY THE SAME POSITION YET THE EYE OF AN ACUTE OBSERVER
AS THE MEN SET THE BOAT'S HEAD TO THE WELCOME LINE OF LIGHTS THAT MARKED THE NECK A BLACK SPOT BALANCED UPON A BLACK LINE WAS SWEPT UNDER THEIR STERN AND CARRIED OUT TO SEA AS IT PASSED THEM THIS BLACK SPOT EMITTED A CRY
AND WE'RE IN AMONG THE GUARD AFORE THEY KNOW WHERE THEY ARE DRAG EM BACK INTO THE PRISON
HE WAS NOW NO MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE INDEED HE WAS LESS THAN MANY FOR THOSE WHO HELD THE FIREARMS WERE THE RULING POWERS WITH A GROAN HE RESIGNED HIMSELF TO HIS FATE AND LOOKING AT THE SLEEVE OF THE UNDRESS UNIFORM HE WORE
HAS ATTEMPTED TO DEPICT THE DISMAL CONDITION OF A FELON DURING HIS TERM OF TRANSPORTATION I HAVE ENDEAVOURED IN HIS NATURAL LIFE TO SET FORTH THE WORKING AND THE RESULTS OF AN ENGLISH SYSTEM OF TRANSPORTATION CAREFULLY CONSIDERED AND CARRIED OUT UNDER OFFICIAL SUPERVISION
AND THIS BLIND ABSORBED MUCH OF THE LIGHT HE COULD BUT JUST SEE THE DECK ABOVE HIS HEAD AND DISTINGUISH THE OUTLINES OF THREE OTHER BERTHS APPARENTLY SIMILAR TO HIS OWN THE ONLY SOUNDS THAT BROKE THE SILENCE WERE THE GURGLING OF THE WATER BELOW HIM
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE FLIGHT GABBETT GUIDED BY THE CROW HAD DETERMINED TO BEACH THE CAPTURED BOAT ON THE SOUTHERN POINT OF CAPE SURVILLE IT WILL BE SEEN BY THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPOGRAPHY OF COLONEL ARTHUR'S PENITENTIARY
RICHARD FORGIVE ME PRAY FOR ME HUSH DEAREST COME LET ME LEAD YOU IN I WILL WRITE I WILL SEND YOU NEWS OF ME ONCE AT LEAST ERE I DEPART SO YOU ARE CALMER MOTHER
A DEED SO BLOODTHIRSTY AND A RESPITE SO UNEXPECTED HAD INVESTED THE NAME OF RUFUS DAWES WITH A GRIM DISTINCTION WHICH HIS SUPERIOR MENTAL ABILITIES NO LESS THAN HIS HAUGHTY TEMPER AND POWERFUL FRAME COMBINED TO SUPPORT
A YOUNG MAN OF TWO AND TWENTY OWNING TO NO FRIENDS AND EXISTING AMONG THEM BUT BY THE FACT OF HIS CRIMINALITY HE WAS RESPECTED AND ADMIRED
AN OLD SOLDIER ON WHOSE FIDELITY HE COULD THOROUGHLY RELY HE THEN DOUBLED THE GUARDS TOOK THE KEYS OF THE PRISON HIMSELF FROM THE NON COMMISSIONED OFFICER WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO KEEP THEM AND SAW THAT THE HOWITZER ON THE LOWER DECK WAS LOADED WITH GRAPE
SHE WAS A DELICATE LOOKING CHILD OF SIX YEARS OLD WITH BLUE EYES AND BRIGHT HAIR THOUGH INDULGED BY HER FATHER AND SPOILED BY HER MOTHER THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF HER DISPOSITION SAVED HER FROM BEING DISAGREEABLE
HIS GREY HAIR WAS MATTED ALL WAYS ABOUT HIS REDDENED FACE AND HE WAS WINKING AND BLINKING LIKE AN OWL IN THE SUNSHINE HE HAD DRUNK A LARGER QUANTITY OF WINE THAN USUAL AT DINNER IN SHEER DELIGHT AT THE APPROACHING ASSIGNATION
MOODILY PATIENT AS IF WAITING FOR SOMETHING THREE MEN TWO PRISONERS AND A SOLDIER HAD SUCCUMBED SINCE RUFUS DAWES HAD BEEN REMOVED TO THE HOSPITAL AND THOUGH AS YET
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE SHOUTED CHESHIRE AS FRERE AND BATES IN OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS BEGAN TO PULL THE JOLLY BOAT TOWARDS THE SHORE AND IN THIS FASHION WAS THE DISMAL LITTLE PARTY CONVEYED TO THE MAINLAND IT WAS NIGHT WHEN THEY REACHED IT
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT GONE OFF TO PINE'S CABIN THE INTELLIGENCE STRUCK HER WITH DISMAY WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF SUCH AN UNUSUAL PROCEEDING SURELY THEY DID NOT SUSPECT WHAT DO THEY WANT THERE SHE ASKED MAURICE FRERE WAS NOT IN THE HUMOUR TO ARGUE QUESTIONS OF PROBABILITY
SAYS THE GIANT LICKING HIS COARSE BLUE LIPS
GLIDED THROUGH THE CAREFULLY ADJUSTED DOOR HE HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO GO ON DRINKING CUC COME SARAH HE HICCUPED IT'S ALL VERY FINE MY LASS BUT YOU NEEDN'T BE SO HIC PROUD YOU KNOW I'M A PLAIN SAILOR
IT SEEMED AN HOUR TO HIS EXCITED FANCY BEFORE HE SAW A LIGHT PASS ALONG THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE HE HAD QUITTED AND KNEW THAT SIR RICHARD HAD SAFELY REACHED HIS CHAMBER WITH SOME BEWILDERED INTENTION OF SUMMONING AID HE LEFT THE BODY AND MADE TOWARDS THE TOWN
THOSE MEN IN WHOM EMOTION HAS THE EFFECT OF QUICKENING CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD REASON RAPIDLY IN MOMENTS OF DANGER AND IN THE TERRIBLE INSTANT WHEN HIS EYES MET THOSE OF LORD BELLASIS RICHARD DEVINE HAD SUMMED UP THE CHANCES OF HIS FUTURE FORTUNE
SHE CAST HER EYES DOWN TO THE DECK AND A MODEST FLUSH ROSE IN HER CHEEKS I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO SHE SAID IN A HALF WHISPER THERE ARE SO MANY EYES UPON ME
THE WHOLE THING IS PERHAPS SOME ABSURDITY OF THAT FELLOW DAWES AND SHOULD WE ONCE PUT THE NOTION OF ATTACKING US INTO THE PRISONERS HEADS THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT THEY MIGHT DO BUT THE MAN SEEMED CERTAIN SAID THE OTHER HE MENTIONED MY WIFE'S MAID TOO
HOPPED OVER THE BARRICADE AND ROLLED TO THE FEET OF RUFUS DAWES WHO WAS STILL LEANING APPARENTLY LOST IN THOUGHT AGAINST THE SIDE THE BRIGHT SPOT OF COLOUR ROLLING ACROSS THE WHITE DECK CAUGHT HIS EYE STOOPING MECHANICALLY HE PICKED UP THE BALL AND STEPPED FORWARD TO RETURN IT
OF THE POSSESSIONS OF THE HOUSE OF WOTTON WADE THIS OLD MANOR TIMBERLESS AND BARE WAS ALL THAT REMAINED AND ITS MASTER RARELY VISITED IT
FRIGHTENED LET ME PASS PRISONER THE WHOLE DECK BURST INTO A GREAT LAUGH AT THIS AND POOR MISSUS VICKERS PAUSED TREMBLING FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CHILD'S TEMERITY TO THUS TAUNT THE DESPERATE CONVICT WHO HELD THEIR LIVES IN HIS HANDS SEEMED SHEER MADNESS
THE TONE WAS AN ORDINARY ONE AND MILES WAS THE SOLDIER WHOM SARAH PURFOY HAD BRIBED NOT TO FIRE ALL HAD GONE WELL THE KEYS CLASHED AND TURNED AND THE BRAVEST OF THE PRUDENT PARTY
AND THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE SHATTERED BOAT'S CREW CLINGING TO AN OAR HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF EM ALIVE SAID BURGESS BANDAGING HIS SPRAINED WRIST TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS AT THE NECK AND HE'S FOOD FOR THE FISHES BY THIS TIME HE WAS MISTAKEN HOWEVER
JEMMY VETCH FEELING BY THAT CURIOUS SYMPATHY WHICH NERVOUS NATURES POSSESS THAT HIS COMRADES WISHED HIM TO ACT AS SPOKESMAN
AND THOUGH EVERY CRANNY AND SEAM IN THE DECK SWELTERED HOT PITCH UNDER THE FIERCE HEAT THE MAN STOOD THERE MOTIONLESS AND MOROSE STARING AT THE SLEEPY SEA
WITH A VELOCITY THAT FORBADE ALL ATTEMPTS AT RESCUE AND ALMOST BEFORE THE POOR SCOUNDREL HAD TIME TO REALIZE HIS CONDITION HE WAS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY OF ESCAPING THE HANGING THAT HIS COMRADES HAD SO OFTEN HUMOROUSLY PROPHESIED FOR HIM
HE COULD GIVE SUCH INFORMATION AS WOULD AVERT THAT DANGER AND SAVE THE SHIP BUT
AND FORCED CLOSE UPON YET SHRINKING BACK FROM THE TRAMPLED AND BLOODY MASS CROUCHED IN MINGLED TERROR AND RAGE THE TWENTY MUTINEERS BEHIND THE MUTINEERS WITHDRAWN FROM THE PATCH OF LIGHT THROWN BY THE OPEN HATCHWAY THE MOUTH OF THE HOWITZER THREATENED DESTRUCTION
FRERE ATTEMPTED TO RESIST THIS INDIGNITY BUT CHESHIRE CLAPPING HIS MUSKET TO HIS EAR SWORE HE WOULD BLOW OUT HIS BRAINS IF HE UTTERED ANOTHER SYLLABLE FRERE CATCHING THE MALIGNANT EYE OF JOHN REX
IT WAS AS THOUGH A SEA BREAKING AGAINST A STONE WALL HAD FOUND SOME BREACH
LEAVING THE HOUSE I TOOK THE WAY ONCE MORE THAT LED TO FORDWITCH WOOD WHAT WOULD MISSUS ROYLAKE HAVE SAID IF SHE HAD DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GOING BACK TO THE MILL THERE WAS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE THE PORTFOLIO WAS A TRUST CONFIDED TO ME
IF YOU WILL HAVE IT SHE BURST OUT THERE IS SOMEBODY ELSE LIVING WITH US A MAN WHO HELPS YOUR FATHER NO A MAN WHO PAYS MY FATHER'S RENT I WAS QUITE UNPREPARED FOR SUCH A REPLY AS THIS CRISTEL HAD SURPRISED ME
I SAID A CHANGE OF EXPRESSION APPEARED IN HER BRIGHT BROWN EYES WHICH ROUSED MY CURIOSITY I ALSO OBSERVED THAT SHE EVADED A DIRECT REPLY WHAT MAKES YOU DOUBT SIR IF FATHER AND I LIVE ALONE SHE ASKED I POINTED TO THE NEW COTTAGE
STILL AS MONOTONOUS AS EVER HIS VOICE IN SOME DEGREE EXPRESSED THE FRENZY THAT WAS IN HIM BY SUDDENLY RISING IN ITS PITCH WHEN HE SPOKE TO ME NEXT MISTER ROYLAKE I LOVE HER MISTER ROYLAKE I AM DETERMINED TO MARRY HER ANY MAN WHO COMES BETWEEN ME AND THAT CRUEL GIRL
WHEN I ADD THAT THIS DISCOVERY DID DECIDEDLY OPERATE AS A RELIEF TO MY MIND THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED ON ME BY THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER IS STATED WITHOUT EXAGGERATION AND WITHOUT RESERVE GOOD NIGHT SHE REPEATED FOR THE LAST TIME
YOU SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN MISS CRISTEL HIS ANSWER RAISED HIM A STEP HIGHER IN MY ESTIMATION HOW CAN I HELP IT SIR AN ODD MAN WITH A PERSONAL APPEARANCE THAT MIGHT EXCITE A PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM IN SOME MINDS
PERFECTLY CHARMING I WAS ANGRY BY THIS TIME YOU HAVE EXACTLY DESCRIBED HER I SAID MISSUS ROYLAKE BEGAN TO GET ANGRY ON HER SIDE SURELY A LITTLE COARSE AND VULGAR SHE SUGGESTED REVERTING TO POOR CRISTEL
AND THE SIGNS OF MASCULINE RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY HIS MOUTH AND CHIN ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST PERSON AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION WAS CRISTEL HE BOWED SMILED POSSESSED HIMSELF ABRUPTLY OF HER HAND AND KISSED IT
YOU WILL ASK ME WHO THE PERSON IS
EVEN A POOR DEVIL LIKE ME DOES SOMETIMES FEEL IT WHEN HE IS INSULTED MISTER ROYLAKE HE KICKED ME SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT SIR I WOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED IT IF I HADN'T HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU ONLY I DON'T KNOW HOW
IN THIS DIFFICULTY HE CAME BACK TO MY BEDSIDE LOOK HERE SIR WHAT I SAY IS THAT KICK HAS WIPED OUT THE DEBT OF THANKS I OWE HIM YES I SAY THE ACCOUNT BETWEEN US TWO IS SETTLED NOW ON BOTH SIDES
THE MAGISTRATE WOULD PUT QUESTIONS TO ME WOULDN'T HE SIR VERY GOOD YOU PUT QUESTIONS TO ME AND I'LL ANSWER THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
HE WAS MORE EAGER THAN EVER AND MORE ELOQUENT THAN EVER IN RETURNING TO THE REPAIRS AND THEN SIR THERE'S THE OVEN THEY DO CALL BREAD THE STAFF OF LIFE IT'S A BURNT STAFF AT ONE TIME AND A CLAMMY STAFF AT ANOTHER
IN HIS CASE I HAD FAILED TO TRACE THE MOTIVE I TRIED TO DISCOVER IT NOW TELL ME WHY I OUGHT TO BREAK MY ENGAGEMENT I SAID REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU AT THE SPRING SHE ANSWERED
SHE POSSESSED TWO SMILES A SUGARY SMILE WITH WHICH I WAS ALREADY ACQUAINTED
NEITHER OF THESE ANTICIPATIONS WAS REALIZED ONCE MORE MY CLEVER STEPMOTHER HAD PUZZLED ME MISSUS ROYLAKE TALKED AS FLUENTLY AS EVER EXHAUSTING ONE COMMON PLACE SUBJECT AFTER ANOTHER
THE CUR HAD BETRAYED HIMSELF IT WAS A PALTRY VENGEANCE I OWN TO GRATIFY A MALICIOUS PLEASURE AS I DID NOW IN THINKING OF HIM AND SPEAKING OF HIM BY THE DEGRADING NAME WHICH HIS MORBID HUMILITY HAD SUGGESTED
I HELD OUT MY HAND IS IT QUITE RIGHT SIR SHE MODESTLY OBJECTED FOR SUCH AS ME TO SHAKE HANDS WITH SUCH AS YOU SHE DID IT NEVERTHELESS AND DROPPING MY HAND CAST A FAREWELL LOOK AT THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT OF HER INTEREST
A MAN WHO CAN CHANGE HIS COMPLEXION AT WILL IS A MAN WE HAV'N'T HEARD OF YET MISTER ROYLAKE I HAD BEEN DRESSING FOR SOME TIME PAST LONGING TO SEE CRISTEL IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY
I BECKONED TO GLOODY WAITING MODESTLY AT THE DOOR TO COME IN AND TELL ME WHAT HE HAD DISCOVERED I SAW HER OUTSIDE SIR RAPPING AT THE DOOR HERE WITH HER PARASOL THAT WAS THE SERVANT'S REPORT HER PARASOL
I FAILED TO SEE IT MYSELF IN THAT LIGHT IT STRUCK ME AS I WALKED HOME THAT CRISTEL MIGHT HAVE MADE MANY A WORSE FRIEND THAN THE RETIRED PRIZE FIGHTER A CHANGE IN MY MANNER WAS OF COURSE REMARKED BY MISSUS ROYLAKE'S READY OBSERVATION
MY LOYALTY TOWARDS THE AFFLICTED MAN WHOSE FRIENDLY ADVANCES I HAD SEEN GOOD REASON TO RETURN WAS IN NO SENSE SHAKEN HIS UNDESERVED MISFORTUNES HIS MANLY APPEAL TO ME AT THE SPRING
I WAS LEFT TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE IF I HAD BEEN TWENTY YEARS OLDER
AND FELT I DON'T DOUBT IT I HAD INTENDED TO SAY NO MORE THAN THIS BUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF GLOODY'S MYSTERIOUS PREVARICATION AND OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH I HAD UNDOUBTEDLY FELT WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AFTERWARDS LED ME I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY HOW
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT DRINK THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE JUG YOU FORGET SIR THAT I HAD SEEN THE DOG REVIVED BY TWO DOSES GIVEN WITH A SPACE OF TIME BETWEEN THEM
THE INVESTIGATION THAT FOLLOWED WAS FAR TOO LONG AND TOO WEARISOME TO BE RELATED HERE IF I GIVE THE SUBSTANCE OF IT I SHALL HAVE DONE ENOUGH SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS AWAKE AND SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ALONE SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP AND DREAMING
WHY SHE TURNED ON ME WITH A LOOK OF ANGRY AMAZEMENT NOT UNDESERVED I MUST OWN ON MY PART WHICH SHOWED HER DARK BEAUTY IN THE PERFECTION OF ITS LUSTER AND ITS POWER TO MY EYES SHE WAS AT THE MOMENT IRRESISTIBLY CHARMING
OF COURSE THAT BOLD GIRL CONTRIVED TO ATTRACT YOUR NOTICE I REPLIED THAT I HAD MET WITH THE BOLD GIRL PURELY BY ACCIDENT ON HER SIDE AS WELL AS ON MINE AND THEN I STARTED A NEW TOPIC
AND THE LURID REDDENING OF THE SUN AS IT STOOPED TO ITS SETTING LOVELY INTERFUSIONS OF SOBERED COLOR RESTED FADED RETURNED AGAIN ON THE UPPER LEAVES OF THE FOLIAGE AS THEY LIGHTLY MOVED THE MIST ROLLING CAPRICIOUSLY OVER THE WATERS
ON THIS OLD SIDE OF THE HOUSE THERE'S FIRST DRAINS HE PROCEEDED TO RECKON UP THE REPAIRS COUNTING WITH HIS FLESHLESS THUMB ON HIS SKINNY FINGERS WHEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A CURIOUS SUCCESSION OF SOUNDS WHICH BEGAN WITH WHINING AND ENDED WITH SCRATCHING AT THE COTTAGE DOOR
I TOLD HER THAT I HAD BEEN ANNOYED AND OFFERED NO OTHER EXPLANATION WONDERFUL TO RELATE SHE SHOWED NO CURIOSITY AND NO SURPRISE MORE WONDERFUL STILL AT EVERY FAIR OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED SHE KEPT OUT OF MY WAY
AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING MORE ABOUT OUR LODGER I HATE HIM BECAUSE I HATE HIM THERE IGNORANT AS I WAS OF THE NATURES OF WOMEN I UNDERSTOOD HER AT LAST CRISTEL'S OPINION OF THE LODGER WAS EVIDENTLY THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THE LODGER'S OPINION OF CRISTEL
TO BEGIN WITH HER FATHER WAS WELL CONNECTED AS WE SAY IN ENGLAND HIS YOUNGER BROTHER HAD MADE A FORTUNE IN COMMERCE AND HAD VAINLY OFFERED HIM THE MEANS OF RETIRING FROM THE MILL WITH A SUFFICIENT INCOME THEN AGAIN GILES TOLLER WAS KNOWN TO HAVE SAVED MONEY
WHAT HIS MASTER HAD NO DOUBT INFERRED WAS WHAT I SAW PLAINLY TOO CRISTEL HAD SAVED MY LIFE AND HAD BEEN DIRECTED HOW TO DO IT BY THE POOR FELLOW WHO HAD SUFFERED IN MY CAUSE
THE ONE WAY OF PUTTING A STOP TO MURDERING MISCHIEF IF MURDERING MISCHIEF IT MIGHT BE WAS TO TRUST MISS CRISTEL THAT SHE WAS FOND OF YOU I DON'T MEAN ANY OFFENCE SIR I PRETTY WELL GUESSED
I SAW DOUBT I SAW ANXIETY IN HER FACE WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE MILL I MADE SOME DOMESTIC INQUIRIES BEGINNING WITH HER FATHER WAS THE MILLER ALIVE AND WELL OH YES SIR FATHER GETS THINNER AS HE GETS OLDER THAT'S ALL
IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I ASKED THAT I OUGHT TO KNOW ONLY ONE THING MISTER ROYLAKE THAT I CAN THINK OF GLOODY REPLIED I'M AFRAID IT'S MISS CRISTEL'S TURN NEXT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THIS ASSERTION OF MY WILL AGAINST HIS ROUSED HIM HE STOPPED ME AT THE DOOR NOT BY A MOTION OF HIS HAND BUT BY THE MASTERY OF HIS LOOK THE DIM CANDLELIGHT AFFORDED ME NO HELP IN DETERMINING THE COLOR OF HIS EYES DARK LARGE AND FINELY SET IN HIS HEAD
I DARESAY I WAS BLIND TO THE DEFECTS IN HER FACE MY GOOD GERMAN TUTOR USED TO LAMENT THAT THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF MY BOYHOOD STILL LEFT IN ME HONESTLY ADMIRING HER I LET MY FAVORABLE OPINION EXPRESS ITSELF A LITTLE TOO PLAINLY
THAT THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO BE IN A MAN'S FACE
I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM YOU MARK MY WORDS I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM THAT OLD TOLLER THE MOST EXASPERATING OF MEN JUDGED BY A QUICK TEMPER HAD IRRITATED MY FRIEND INTO SPEAKING RASHLY WAS PLAIN ENOUGH NEVERTHELESS I FELT SOME ANXIETY
HER MANNER HAD BECOME QUIETER HER FACE WAS MORE COMPOSED HER EXPRESSION ALMOST RECOVERED ITS NATURAL CHARM WHILE SHE SPOKE OF LADY RACHEL I WAS STUPEFIED TRY SIR TO FORGET IT AND FORGIVE IT SHE RESUMED GENTLY
AND THAT I HAD MET HER PURELY BY ACCIDENT WHEN HE HAD DETECTED US TALKING OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE SEEING ME PAUSE AFTER ADVANCING TO THAT POINT IN THE WRITING OF MY REPLY HE HELD OUT HIS HAND IMPATIENTLY FOR THE PAPER I SIGNED HIM TO WAIT AND ADDED A LAST SENTENCE UNDERSTAND THIS
MISTER GERARD YOU WERE LOST IN YOUR THOUGHTS I SPOKE AND YOU NEVER HEARD ME I LOOKED AT HER IN SILENCE WAS THIS THE DEAR CRISTEL SO WELL KNOWN TO ME OR WAS IT A MOCKERY OF HER THAT HAD TAKEN HER PLACE
WE WERE TOGETHER IN THE INDIAN WARS AND TOGETHER IN ALL THE BATTLES FROM VERA CRUZ TO THE CITY OF MEXICO IT'S JOHN CARRINGTON AND HE'S FROM NEW YORK HE'S PERFECTLY WONDERFUL WITH THE GUNS LORD LAD LOOK HOW HE LIVES UP TO HIS REPUTATION
THEY WERE GOING INTO BATTLE IN THE MORNING AND WITH MEN WHOM HE DID NOT HATE THE ATTACKS ON THE STAR OF THE WEST AND SUMTER HAD BEEN BOMBARDMENTS DISTANT AFFAIRS WHERE HE DID NOT SEE THE FACE OF HIS ENEMY
SURCHARGED EVERYWHERE WITH THE FIERY BREATH OF WAR HARRY REALIZED AS HE APPROACHED THE CAPITAL THE DEEP INTENSITY OF FEELING IN EVERYBODY THE VIRGINIANS WERE LESS VOLATILE THAN THE SOUTH CAROLINIANS AND THEY HAD LONG REFUSED TO GO OUT
AN THIS BOAT IS TOO HEAVY TO BE CARRIED AROUND IT THEY REACHED RUDD'S PLACE ABOUT DARK HE WAS A HOSPITABLE MOUNTAINEER WITH A DOUBLE ROOMED LOG CABIN A WIFE
BE SHORE YOU FOLLOW THE TRAIL JEST AS I LAID IT OUT TO YOU AN IN TWO DAYS YOU'LL STRIKE THE WILDERNESS ROAD AFTER THAT IT'S EASY WHEN HARRY RODE AWAY SOMETHING ROSE IN HIS THROAT AND CHOKED HIM FOR A MOMENT
NEARLY TWO SCORE OF THE INVINCIBLES HAD FALLEN TO RISE NO MORE AND ABOUT A HUNDRED WERE WOUNDED IT WAS NO SMALL LOSS EVEN FOR A VETERAN FORCE AND COLONEL TALBOT AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAINT HILAIRE LOOKED GRAVE
DID NOT COME THAT NIGHT BUT IT DID ON THE FOLLOWING ONE THEN JARVIS AND HE AFTER SUPPER WENT ABOUT A MILE UP THE STREAM STALKING THE BEST DRINKING PLACES
YOU'D BE KILLED INSIDE OF A MINUTE HE CRIED CARRINGTON IS OUT THERE WITH THE GUNS AS SOON AS THEIR TROOPS ARE FAR ENOUGH BACK HE'LL OPEN ON US WITH THE CANNON AND HE'LL RAKE THIS FORT LIKE A HURRICANE BEATING UPON A FOREST
HE WAS NOT ONE TO SENTIMENTALIZE BUT THE SIGHT OF THE DEFIANT FLAG THE MOST BEAUTIFUL IN ALL THE WORLD STIRRED HIM IN EVERY FIBER IT WAS THE FLAG UNDER WHICH BOTH HIS FATHER AND COLONEL TALBOT HAD FOUGHT
THEY WERE PERMITTED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE LAST SUCH STOP JARVIS REMARKED RATHER GRIMLY THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THERE ARE THREE GOOD RIFLES IN THIS BOAT
HEAVIER AND HEAVIER GREW THE BANK OF SMOKE OVER AND AGAINST THE FOREST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE BUT HARRY HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE NORTHERN REGIMENTS WERE MASSING THEMSELVES FOR THE ATTACK THE YOUTH REMAINED WITH COLONEL TALBOT
HARRY HEARD FROM SOME OF THE OFFICERS THAT THE ARMY WAS GATHERED AT A PLACE CALLED MANASSAS JUNCTION WHERE BEAUREGARD HAD TAKEN COMMAND ON JUNE FIRST AND TO WHICH HE WOULD QUICKLY RETURN BUT HARRY DID NOT KNOW ANY OF THESE OFFICERS
RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE AND MANY OTHERS THE SHADES OF THE GREAT VIRGINIANS ROSE IN A HOST BEFORE HIM HE ARRIVED ABOUT NOON AND AS HE CARRIED NO BAGGAGE EXCEPT HIS SADDLE BAGS AND WEAPONS HE WAS QUICKLY WITHIN THE CITY
ALTHOUGH EVERYTHING GENERALLY HAPPENS FOR THE BEST THERE IS A SLIP SOMETIMES HE SAID
NO ONE COULD SEE INTO THE FUTURE HE WAS NOW ACROSS THE VALLEY AND HIS PATH LED ALONG THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN HE LOOKED BACK AND SAW THE FOUR STANDING ON THE PORCH JARVIS IKE MISSUS SIMMONS AND OLD AUNT SUSE
IT SEEMED THAT HE COULD MAKE HIS SHELLS HIT WHEREVER HE WISHED IF A RECRUIT LEFT A TRENCH IT WAS ONLY TO MAKE A RUSH FOR ANOTHER IF THEIR NERVES SETTLED DOWN FOR A MOMENT THAT SOLEMN BOOM FROM THE FOREST AND THE SHRIEK OF THE SHELL
FELL TOGETHER BACK TO THE BOTTOM THE NORTHERN GUNNERS IN THE REAR OF THE ATTACK COULD NOT FIRE FOR FEAR OF HITTING THEIR OWN TROOPS BUT THE SOUTHERN CANNON AT THE EMBRASURES HAD A CLEAR TARGET SHOT AND SHELL CRASHED INTO THE NORTHERN RANKS
AND TO THE WARM FRIENDSHIP OF ARTHUR SAINT CLAIR WHO APPARENTLY WAS RELATED TO EVERYBODY A LETTER CAME FROM HIS FATHER TO WHOM HE HAD WRITTEN AT ONCE OF HIS PURPOSE GIVING HIS APPROVAL AND SENDING HIM MORE MONEY COLONEL KENTON WROTE THAT HE WOULD COME SOUTH HIMSELF
BUT HARRY SURMISED THAT IT HAD MADE THE MOUNTAINEERS CAUTIOUS SUPPRESSING THEIR NATURAL CURIOSITY HE DID NOT OBJECT AT ALL TO THEIR RETICENCE AS IT MADE TRAVELING EASIER FOR HIM
COLONEL TALBOT TOLD ME LONG AGO THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A TERRIBLY BIG WAR AND NOW I KNOW HE WAS RIGHT A LONG TIME PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEMONSTRATION ON THE PART OF THE ENEMY THE SUN REACHED THE ZENITH AND BLAZED
THE FAINT MOON THROWING A GHOSTLY LIGHT OVER SO MANY MOTIONLESS FORMS MADE THE WHOLE SCENE WEIRD AND UNREAL TO HARRY HE SHOOK HIMSELF TO CAST OFF THE SPELL AND CLOSING HIS EYES SOUGHT SLEEP
HARRY WAS DRAWN DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD DIM PAST LYING THERE IN THE GORGE WITH ONLY THE RIVER TO BE SEEN THE WILDERNESS CAME BACK AND THE WHOLE LAND
THEY ARE THERE YET AND THEY WILL REMAIN HE ANNOUNCED AT LAST WE HAVE BEATEN BACK THE ASSAULT THEY MAY HOLD US HERE UNTIL A GREAT ARMY COMES AND WITH HEAVY LOSS TO THEM BUT WE ARE YET BESIEGED CARRINGTON WILL NOT LET US REST
THEY WORE SLOUCH HATS AND WERE WRAPPED IN HEAVY DARK CLOAKS
THE LIGHTNING FLASHED AND THE WILD SEA LASHED THE SHORE WITH ITS FOAMING WAVE AND THE THUNDER PASSED ON THE RUSHING BLAST AS IT HOWLED O'ER THE ROVER'S GRAVE
HAD CAUSED THE SPEEDY WITHDRAWAL OF SHEPARD SEVERAL MORE DAYS PASSED HARRY FOUND THAT HE WAS TAKEN INTO THE CITY'S HEART AND ITS SPELL WAS VERY STRONG UPON HIM HE KNEW THAT MUCH OF HIS WELCOME WAS DUE TO THE POWERFUL INFLUENCE OF COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT
IT APPEARS THAT MY ROOM HAD BEEN ENGAGED ALREADY BY ANOTHER MAN BEGINNING TOMORROW MORNING I WAS NOT INFORMED OF IT WHEN I CAME HERE BUT MADAME DELAUNAY HAS RECALLED THE FACT AND I CANNOT DOUBT THE WORD OF A CHARLESTON LADY IT APPEARS ALSO THAT NO OTHER ROOM IS VACANT
AND THAT THE TRENCHES HAD BEEN DUG SO MUCH DEEPER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE COOL SHADE WAS BEGINNING TO FALL ON THE EASTERN FOREST THEY NOTICED A MOVEMENT IN THE WOODS THEY SAW THE SWAYING OF BUSHES AND THE OFFICERS WHO HAD GLASSES
BUT NOW THAT THEY WERE OUT THEY WERE POURING INTO THE SOUTHERN ARMY AND THEY WERE ANIMATED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ZEAL HE BEGAN TO HEAR NEW OR UNFAMILIAR NAMES EARLY AND EWELL AND JACKSON AND LEE AND JOHNSTON AND HILL AND STUART AND ASHBY
PRODUCED THREE TIN CUPS AND WITH THESE SIMPLE PREPARATIONS THEY BEGAN THEIR SUPPER THE FLAMES WENT DOWN AND THE FIRE BECAME A GREAT BED OF COALS GLOWING IN THE DARKNESS
IT IS OUR BUSINESS TO DRIVE THEM OUT THE COLONEL TOLD SOME OF THE OFFICERS WITHIN HARRY'S HEARING THAT THEY COULD ATTACK BEFORE DAWN BUT NIGHT ASSAULTS UNLESS WITH VETERAN TROOPS GENERALLY DEFEATED THEMSELVES THROUGH CONFUSION AND UNCERTAINTY
THESE SHELLS AND CANNON BALLS FLYING OVER ME MAKE MY HEAD ACHE AND SCARE ME TO DEATH BESIDES IF THE YANKEES DON'T HURRY UP AND CHARGE THEY'LL FIND ME DEAD KILLED BY THE COLLAPSE OF WORN OUT NERVES I INTEND TO BE READY WHEN THEY COME SAID SAINT CLAIR
I AM TO HELP IN BUILDING THE FORTIFICATIONS AND AS I AM ABOUT TO MAKE A TOUR OF INSPECTION I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME HARRY FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH SECESSION WAS ONLY A FEW DAYS OLD THE WORK OF OFFENSE AND DEFENSE WAS ALREADY FAR ADVANCED
IT GRIPS YOU ABOUT THE HEART SOME WAY OR OTHER AN IT SOUNDS BEST WHEN YOU ARE OUT AT NIGHT ON A RIVER LIKE THIS HARRY I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOIN THROUGH OUR MOUNTINS TO GIT TO RICHMOND AN THE WAR
AND MAKING A CIRCLE OF LIGHT THE EDGES OF WHICH TOUCHED THE BOAT HARRY FOUND THAT JARVIS WAS TELLING THE TRUTH THE LONG WORK AND THE COOL NIGHT AIR WITHOUT A ROOF ABOVE HIM
THAT ALWAYS FLOATS JEST BEFORE MY HANDS A SORT O PLEASANT SADNESS I'D CALL IT AH WELL I YET REMEMBER WHEN WE GATHERED IN THE COTTON SIDE BY SIDE
WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE MUCH OF EACH OTHER COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT RAISED HIS EYEBROWS WHEN THEY WALKED A LITTLE FURTHER HE EXCUSED HIMSELF
NOW COVERED THE NORTHERN RETREAT THE FIRING HAD BEEN SO RAPID AND SO HEAVY THAT THE WHOLE FIELD IN FRONT OF THE FORT WAS COVERED WITH SMOKE THROUGH WHICH THEY CAUGHT ONLY THE GLEAM OF BAYONETS AND GLIMPSES OF BATTLE FLAGS
ESPECIALLY LADS OF SPIRIT AND FIRE LIKE YOU YOU SHALL BE A SECOND LIEUTENANT IN HIS COMMAND A TRAIN WILL LEAVE HERE IN FOUR HOURS BE READY IT WILL TAKE YOU PART OF THE WAY AND YOU WILL MARCH ON FOR THE REST
CONTINUED THE HEAD OF THE CONFEDERACY THE SOUTHERN LEADERS DID THEIR BEST BUT THEY COULD NOT MOVE THE STATE AND YOU WISH THEN TO SERVE AT THE FRONT CONTINUED THE PRESIDENT IF I MAY RETURNED HARRY IN SOUTH CAROLINA I WAS WITH COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT
THE ONE WITH THE STARS AND STRIPES FLYING SO DEFIANTLY OVER IT THAT'S FORT SUMTER YESTERDAY WHILE WE WERE ENJOYING OUR CHRISTMAS DINNER AND TALKING OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD DO MAJOR ANDERSON WHO COMMANDED THE UNITED STATES GARRISON IN FORT MOULTRIE
BUT THOSE NEARER WERE SO STILL THAT THEY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PUT THERE TO STAY FOREVER SAINT CLAIR HAD YIELDED AT LAST TO WEARINESS AND WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE TREE SLEPT BY HARRY'S SIDE
UNLESS THE SET EXPRESSION OF HER LIPS AND THE UNNATURAL STEADINESS OF HER EYES BETRAYED IT TO THAT EXPERIENCED READER OF HUMAN HEARTS WHATEVER HE SUSPECTED OR SAW MISTER POWER KEPT TO HIMSELF
AND BROWN RINGS OF HAIR LYING ON THE SMOOTH LOW FOREHEAD A YOUNG FACE BUT NOT CHILDLIKE FOR IT WAS CONSCIOUS OF ITS OWN PRETTINESS AND BETRAYED THE FACT BY LITTLE AIRS AND GRACES THAT REMINDED ONE OF A COQUETTISH KITTEN
NO SHE IS USED TO PARTING WITH THOSE WHOM SHE HAS HELPED AND IS ALWAYS GLAD TO SET THEM ON THEIR WAY TOWARD BETTER THINGS I WILL WRITE TO MORROW AND YOU CAN COME WHENEVER YOU WILL SURE OF A WELCOME MY CHILD
FOR SHE WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS THOUGH EVIDENTLY YOUNGER THAN SHE LOOKED RACHEL'S FACE WAS THAT OF ONE WHO HAD KNOWN SOME GREAT SORROW SOME DEEP EXPERIENCE
HER EVENINGS AT HOME WERE DEVOTED TO BOOKS FOR SHE HAD THE TRUE NEW ENGLAND WOMAN'S DESIRE FOR EDUCATION AND READ OR STUDIED FOR THE LOVE OF IT THUS SHE HAD MUCH TO THINK OF AS HER NEEDLE FLEW
SHE SAID GAZING UP AT HIM WITH HER OWN EYES BRIGHT WITH WONDER AND HER CHEEKS GLOWING WITH THE DELICATE CARMINE OF THE FROSTY AIR I AM THINKING THAT YOU LOOK MORE LIKE A ROSE THAN EVER ANSWERED DAVID
TURNING HER ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF BY A COMPLIMENT AND BEGINNING TO ADMIRE THE FLOWERS STILL WITH THAT FLUSHED AND KINDLED LOOK ON HIS OWN FACE CHRISTIE CREPT UPSTAIRS AND SITTING IN THE DARK
THEE IS TOO HARD UPON THYSELF DAVY FORGET THE PAST AND BE HAPPY AS OTHER MEN ARE THEE HAS ATONED FOR THY FAULT LONG AGO SO LET ME SEE THEE AT PEACE BEFORE I DIE MY SON
AS SHE EYED THE NEW COMER WHO LEANED BACK IN THE GREAT CHAIR TALKING TO DAVID WHO STOOD ON THE RUG EVIDENTLY FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO LOOK AT THE VIVACIOUS FACE BEFORE HIM THAN AT THE FIRE
YOU MUST TAKE IT HEPSEY FOR I COULD NOT REST HAPPY IF I PUT IT AWAY TO LIE IDLE WHILE YOU CAN SAVE MEN AND WOMEN FROM TORMENT WITH IT I'D GIVE IT IF IT WAS MY LAST PENNY
FOR NOW HE FELT AS IF HE HAD NOT ONLY A FELLOW WORKER BUT A COMRADE AND FRIEND WHO UNDERSTOOD SYMPATHIZED WITH AND ENCOURAGED HIM BY AN INTEREST AND GOOD WILL INEXPRESSIBLY COMFORTABLE
BUT NEVER TREATED HER AS SHE DID CHRISTIE AND THOUGH NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN BETWEEN THEM THE ELDER WOMEN KNEW THAT THEY QUITE AGREED IN THEIR OPINION OF KITTY SHE EVIDENTLY WAS RATHER AFRAID OF THE OLD LADY
AND MISTER POWER CAN GIVE THEE WORK BETTER SUITED TO THY TASTE THAN ANY HERE WE SHALL SEE THEE SOMETIMES AND SPRING WILL MAKE THEE LONG FOR THE FLOWERS I HOPE WAS MISSUS STERLING'S ANSWER
I THANK THEE DAUGHTER THINGS WERE IN THIS PROSPEROUS NOT TO SAY PARADISIACAL STATE WHEN ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY BEGAN TO MAKE DISCOVERIES OF AN ALARMING NATURE
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT TO ALL THAT HER EARLY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE HARD AND SORDID SIDE OF LIFE HAD BRUSHED THE BLOOM FROM HER NATURE AND FILLED HER MIND WITH THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS UNFITTED TO HER YEARS MISSUS STERLING WAS VERY KIND TO HER
WITH A MUTE ELOQUENCE SHE COULD NOT RESIST IN VAIN DID RACHEL ANSWER HER WITH QUIET COLDNESS NOD SILENTLY WHEN SHE WISHED HER A CHEERY GOOD MORNING AND KEEP RESOLUTELY IN HER OWN SOMEWHAT ISOLATED CORNER
A FEW WORDS WHICH SHE ACCIDENTALLY OVERHEARD CONFIRMED THIS IDEA AND SHOWED HER WHAT SHE MUST DO AS SHE CAME QUIETLY IN ONE EVENING FROM A STROLL IN THE LANE AND STOOD TAKING OFF CLOAK AND HOOD
YOU WILL BELIEVE THIS AND LOVE ME STILL THOUGH I GO AWAY AND LEAVE YOU FOR A LITTLE WHILE PRAYED CHRISTIE WITH A FACE FULL OF TREACHEROUS EMOTION MISSUS STERLING LAID HER HAND ON CHRISTIE'S HEAD AS SHE KNELT DOWN IMPULSIVELY BEFORE HER
SUDDENLY FACED THE FACT SAYING TO HERSELF WITH GREAT CANDOR AND DECISION I KNOW WHAT ALL THIS MEANS I'M BEGINNING TO LIKE DAVID MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR ME
AND MISSUS STERLING WAS SURPRISED AND ENTERTAINED BY THIS NEW LOQUACITY IN THE EVENING SHE READ AND STUDIED WITH A DILIGENCE THAT AMAZED AND RATHER DISGUSTED DAVID SINCE SHE KEPT ALL HER LIVELY CHAT FOR HIS MOTHER
THOUGHT CHRISTIE GRIMLY AS SHE BURNT UP SEVERAL LONG CHERISHED RELICS OF HER LOVE SHE WAS UP EARLY AND WENT ABOUT HER USUAL WORK WITH THE SAD PLEASURE WITH WHICH ONE PERFORMS A TASK FOR THE LAST TIME
FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR DAVID'S LEARNING SHE COVERED THE IRRUPTIVE SOFA NEATLY SAW THAT THE LITTLE VASE WAS ALWAYS CLEAR AND FRESHLY FILLED CARED FOR THE NURSERY IN THE GABLE WINDOW
IF MASCULINE COMMENDATION REWARDED THE LABOR FOURTHLY AND WORST OF ALL SHE DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HALF CONFIDENCES AND QUITE PINED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT DAVID'S TROUBLE
AND DID NOT DISGUISE HER SATISFACTION SO CHRISTIE'S LAST DAY WAS ANY THING BUT PLEASANT MISTER POWER WOULD SEND FOR HER ON THE MORROW AND SHE BUSIED HERSELF IN PACKING HER OWN POSSESSIONS SETTING EVERY THING IN ORDER
THE LITTLE NEEDLE BOOK WITH THE FADED LETTY ON IT HAUNTED HER
AND WHEN ALONE WITH HER PUT ON AIRS THAT HALF AMUSED HALF IRRITATED THE OTHER DAVID IS MY FRIEND AND I DON'T CARE FOR ANY ONE ELSE HER MANNER SAID AS PLAINLY AS WORDS
IF I GET THROUGH THIS PARTING WITHOUT DISGRACING MYSELF I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME AFTERWARD SHE SAID AND IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT DO SO SHE ASSUMED A CHEERFUL AIR
YOU'D BETTER THINK AGAIN BEFORE YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND HE IS RESPECTABLE WELL OFF AND FOND OF YOU IT SEEMS WHY NOT TRY IT KITTY YOU NEED SOME ONE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU SADLY
AS CHRISTIE GAVE BACK THE NOTE AT THE END OF HER DIFFICULT SPEECH DON'T THINK ME UNGRATEFUL I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY HERE
BUT HE FOUND IT SO EASY AND PLEASANT TO BE A FRIEND THAT HE REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR NOT TRYING IT BEFORE AND EXPLAINED HIS NEGLECT BY THE FACT THAT CHRISTIE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY WOMAN
CHRISTIE HAD WON HER HEART LONG AGO AND NOW WAS AS DEVOTED AS A DAUGHTER TO HER LIGHTENING HER CARES SO SKILFULLY THAT MANY OF THEM SLIPPED NATURALLY ON TO THE YOUNG SHOULDERS AND LEFT THE OLD LADY MUCH TIME FOR REST
SHE LIKED TO RETURN AT NIGHT TO HER OWN LITTLE HOME SOLITARY AND SIMPLE AS IT WAS AND FELT A GREAT REPUGNANCE TO ACCEPT ANY PLACE WHERE SHE WOULD BE MIXED UP WITH FAMILY AFFAIRS AGAIN
OR ANY KINDRED SUBJECT THIRDLY THAT HOME WAS WOMAN'S SPHERE AFTER ALL AND THE PERFECT ROASTING OF BEEF BREWING OF TEA AND CONCOCTING OF DELECTABLE PUDDINGS AN END WORTH LIVING FOR
SINCE SHARES IN THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD PAY SPLENDID DIVIDENDS THAT NEVER FAIL ANOTHER PORTION OF HER FORTUNE AS SHE CALLED HARRY'S GIFT WAS BESTOWED IN WEDDING PRESENTS UPON LUCY WHO AT LENGTH
AND INSPIRING NOTHING DISTURBED THE CHARM OF THE NEW LEAGUE IN THOSE EARLY DAYS FOR CHRISTIE WAS THOROUGHLY SIMPLE AND SINCERE AND DID HER WOMANLY WORK WITH NO THOUGHT OF REWARD OR LOVE OR ADMIRATION
KITTY WAS PUZZLED AND PIQUED BY THESE CHANGES AND BEING A BORN FLIRT TRIED ALL HER POWERS ON DAVID VEILED UNDER GUILELESS GIRLISHNESS
BUT A YOUNG GIRL WITH HER HEAD FULL OF LOVE AND LOVERS THE BLUE EYES GREW SHY THE PRETTY FACE GREW ELOQUENT WITH BLUSHES NOW AND THEN AS HE LOOKED AT IT AND THE LIVELY TONGUE FALTERED SOMETIMES IN SPEAKING TO HIM
I SEE THIS CLEARLY AND WON'T DODGE ANY LONGER BUT PUT A STOP TO IT AT ONCE OF COURSE I CAN IF I CHOOSE AND NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT FOR I UNDERSTAND MYSELF PERFECTLY
SO YOU SHALL TAKE HER PLACE AND VISIT MY POOR REPORT THEIR NEEDS AND SUPPLY THEM AS FAST AS WE CAN DOES THAT SUIT YOU ENTIRELY SIR WHERE SHALL I LIVE ASKED CHRISTIE
IF MILES DON'T COME AND CARRY ME OFF AS HE SAID HE WOULD ANSWERED KITTY WITH A TOSS OF THE HEAD WHICH SHOWED SHE WAS NOT SO CHILDLIKE AS DAVID FANCIED BUT THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS SITTING ON A STOOL AT HIS FEET PETTING THE CAT
A THOUSAND LITTLE COQUETRIES WERE PLAYED OFF FOR HIS BENEFIT AND FREQUENT APPEALS FOR ADVICE IN HER HEART AFFAIRS KEPT TENDER SUBJECTS UPPERMOST IN THEIR CONVERSATIONS
LAZY LITTLE KITTY NEVER APPEARED TILL THE BELL RANG
AND OFTEN STOPPED TO ADMIRE THE WORK OF HER TASTEFUL FINGERS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST SUCH FRIENDLY OVERTURES
TAKES THE URN AND EMBRACING IT POURS FORTH HER GRIEF IN LANGUAGE FULL OF TENDERNESS AND DESPAIR MILTON IN ONE OF HIS SONNETS SAYS
AND ROUND ORESTES BADE THEM HOWL AND HISS FOR THAT UNNATURAL RETRIBUTION JUST
AND THE GREEKS BEGAN TO DESPAIR OF EVER SUBDUING IT BY FORCE AND BY ADVICE OF ULYSSES RESOLVED TO RESORT TO STRATAGEM THEY PRETENDED TO BE MAKING PREPARATIONS TO ABANDON THE SIEGE
THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING PENTHEUS BEHOLDING HIM WITH WRATHFUL COUNTENANCE SAID FELLOW YOU SHALL SPEEDILY BE PUT TO DEATH THAT YOUR FATE MAY BE A WARNING TO OTHERS BUT THOUGH I GRUDGE THE DELAY OF YOUR PUNISHMENT SPEAK
WHEN THE RIVER SWELLED IT MADE ITSELF ANOTHER CHANNEL THUS ITS HEAD WAS HORNED HERCULES PREVENTED THE RETURN OF THESE PERIODICAL OVERFLOWS BY EMBANKMENTS AND CANALS AND THEREFORE HE WAS SAID TO HAVE VANQUISHED THE RIVER GOD AND CUT OFF HIS HORN FINALLY THE LANDS FORMERLY SUBJECT TO OVERFLOW BUT NOW REDEEMED
WHO HAD NO RESPECT FOR THE NEW WORSHIP FORBADE ITS RITES TO BE PERFORMED BUT WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT BACCHUS WAS ADVANCING MEN AND WOMEN BUT CHIEFLY THE LATTER YOUNG AND OLD POURED FORTH TO MEET HIM AND TO JOIN HIS TRIUMPHAL MARCH
VANQUISHED IN THIS FORM I TRIED WHAT ALONE REMAINED TO ME AND ASSUMED THE FORM OF A BULL HE GRASPED MY NECK WITH HIS ARM
PERHAPS YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE FAME OF DEJANIRA THE FAIREST OF MAIDENS WHOM A HOST OF SUITORS STROVE TO WIN HERCULES AND MYSELF WERE OF THE NUMBER AND THE REST YIELDED TO US TWO
AND GET NO FAME FROM THE CONTEST WITH ME
THE MEN ASTONISHED PULLED AT THEIR OARS AND SPREAD MORE SAIL TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS BY THE AID OF BOTH BUT ALL IN VAIN IVY TWINED ROUND THE OARS AND HINDERED THEIR MOTION AND CLUNG TO THE SAILS WITH HEAVY CLUSTERS OF BERRIES
UNMOVED BY THE DISSUADING COUNSEL OF AN AFFECTIONATE BUT TIMID SISTER AND UNABLE TO PROCURE ASSISTANCE SHE DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE HAZARD AND TO BURY THE BODY WITH HER OWN HANDS SHE WAS DETECTED IN THE ACT AND CREON GAVE ORDERS THAT SHE SHOULD BE BURIED ALIVE
BECAME VERY FERTILE AND THIS IS MEANT BY THE HORN OF PLENTY THERE IS ANOTHER ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE CORNUCOPIA JUPITER AT HIS BIRTH WAS COMMITTED BY HIS MOTHER RHEA TO THE CARE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF MELISSEUS A CRETAN KING THEY FED THE INFANT DEITY WITH THE MILK OF THE GOAT
MY COUNTRY IS MAEONIA MY PARENTS WERE POOR PEOPLE WHO HAD NO FIELDS OR FLOCKS TO LEAVE ME BUT THEY LEFT ME THEIR FISHING RODS AND NETS AND THEIR FISHERMAN'S TRADE THIS I FOLLOWED FOR SOME TIME TILL GROWING WEARY OF REMAINING IN ONE PLACE
AND GATHERING UP THE SLEEP FROM HER BODY CLOSED IT AGAIN IN THE BOX AND WAKED PSYCHE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH OF ONE OF HIS ARROWS AGAIN SAID HE HAST THOU ALMOST PERISHED BY THE SAME CURIOSITY
BUT WHEN THE HERO BENT OVER HIS FALLEN FOE AND CONTEMPLATED HER BEAUTY YOUTH AND VALOR HE BITTERLY REGRETTED HIS VICTORY THERSITES
I KNOW HIM AS WELL AS HE KNOWS HIMSELF HE IS NOT A WANDERING DEITY BUT BELONGS TO THESE MOUNTAINS NOR IS HE LIKE TOO MANY OF THE LOVERS NOWADAYS WHO LOVE ANY ONE THEY HAPPEN TO SEE HE LOVES YOU AND YOU ONLY
THE TRADITIONAL SITE OF TROY HE HAD UNCOVERED THE ANCIENT CAPITAL SCHLIEMANN EXCAVATED DOWN BELOW THE RUINS OF THREE OR FOUR SETTLEMENTS EACH REVEALING AN EARLIER CIVILIZATION
AND I HOPE IT WILL HAVE THE EFFECT TO MAKE YOU MORE MERCIFUL IPHIS WAS A YOUNG MAN OF HUMBLE PARENTAGE WHO SAW AND LOVED ANAXARETE A
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO MAKE A SECOND DRAUGHT OF IT BUT WHEN HE SET THE HORN DOWN AND LOOKED IN HE COULD SCARCELY PERCEIVE THAT THE LIQUOR WAS DIMINISHED AFTER TAKING BREATH THOR WENT TO IT AGAIN WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BUT WHEN HE TOOK THE HORN FROM HIS MOUTH IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD DRUNK RATHER LESS THAN BEFORE
BACCHUS THAT FIRST FROM OUT THE PURPLE GRAPES CRUSHED THE SWEET POISON OF MISUSED WINE AFTER THE TUSCAN MANNERS TRANSFORMED COASTING THE TYRRHENE SHORE AS THE WINDS LISTED ON CIRCE'S ISLAND FELL
ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD RUN A RACE WITH ANY ONE WHO MIGHT BE MATCHED AGAINST HIM THE KING OBSERVED THAT SKILL IN RUNNING WAS SOMETHING TO BOAST OF BUT IF THE YOUTH WOULD WIN THE MATCH HE MUST DISPLAY GREAT AGILITY
I HAVE HEARD YOU WHISPERING TO ONE ANOTHER THAT I AM NOT A MAN OF SMALL DIMENSIONS
BLINDED BY THE GOD CRIED OUT SEE THERE THE WILD BOAR THE HUGEST MONSTER THAT PROWLS IN THESE WOODS COME ON SISTERS I WILL BE THE FIRST TO STRIKE THE WILD BOAR THE WHOLE BAND RUSHED UPON HIM AND WHILE HE NOW TALKS LESS ARROGANTLY
NOW UPON THE SURFACE NOW UNDER IT SCATTERING THE SPRAY AND SPOUTING THE WATER FROM THEIR BROAD NOSTRILS OF TWENTY MEN I ALONE WAS LEFT TREMBLING WITH FEAR THE GOD CHEERED ME FEAR NOT SAID HE STEER TOWARDS NAXOS
SKRYMIR SOON FELL ASLEEP AND BEGAN TO SNORE STRONGLY
TROY THE FACTS RELATING TO THE CITY OF TROY ARE STILL UNKNOWN TO HISTORY ANTIQUARIANS HAVE LONG SOUGHT FOR THE ACTUAL CITY AND SOME RECORD OF ITS RULERS
POLYNICES KNOWING THIS GAVE ERIPHYLE THE COLLAR OF HARMONIA
NOR SHALL CUPID EVER BREAK AWAY FROM THE KNOT IN WHICH HE IS TIED BUT THESE NUPTIALS SHALL BE PERPETUAL THUS PSYCHE BECAME AT LAST UNITED TO CUPID AND IN DUE TIME THEY HAD A DAUGHTER BORN TO THEM WHOSE NAME WAS PLEASURE
HER TWO ELDER SISTERS OF MODERATE CHARMS HAD NOW LONG BEEN MARRIED TO TWO ROYAL PRINCES BUT PSYCHE IN HER LONELY APARTMENT DEPLORED HER SOLITUDE SICK OF THAT BEAUTY WHICH WHILE IT PROCURED ABUNDANCE OF FLATTERY HAD FAILED TO AWAKEN LOVE
THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE FIRST APPEARS IN THE WORKS OF APULEIUS A WRITER OF THE SECOND CENTURY OF OUR ERA IT IS THEREFORE OF MUCH MORE RECENT DATE THAN MOST OF THE LEGENDS OF THE AGE OF FABLE IT IS THIS THAT KEATS ALLUDES TO IN HIS ODE TO PSYCHE
BUT RECEIVING AID FROM NEW ALLIES STILL CONTINUED ITS RESISTANCE ONE OF THESE ALLIES WAS MEMNON
RESOLVED THAT IF HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF STRIKING A THIRD BLOW IT SHOULD SETTLE ALL MATTERS BETWEEN THEM
BUT HIS ACCENTS WERE FULL OF LOVE AND INSPIRED A LIKE PASSION IN HER SHE OFTEN BEGGED HIM TO STAY AND LET HER BEHOLD HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT CONSENT ON THE CONTRARY HE CHARGED HER TO MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE HIM
LOOKED OUT OVER THE SEA AND SAID IN A VOICE OF WEEPING SAILORS THESE ARE NOT THE SHORES YOU PROMISED TO TAKE ME TO YONDER ISLAND IS NOT MY HOME WHAT HAVE I DONE THAT YOU SHOULD TREAT ME SO
PUT THEM IN CONCEALMENT THAT YOUR HUSBAND MAY NOT DISCOVER THEM AND WHEN HE IS SOUND ASLEEP SLIP OUT OF BED BRING FORTH YOUR LAMP AND SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER WHAT THEY SAY IS TRUE OR NOT IF IT IS HESITATE NOT TO CUT OFF THE MONSTER'S HEAD AND THEREBY RECOVER YOUR LIBERTY
WHO SHOULD COME FOR HER IN A CHARIOT DRAWN BY LIONS AND BOARS THIS TASK ADMETUS PERFORMED BY THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS DIVINE HERDSMAN AND WAS MADE HAPPY IN THE POSSESSION OF ALCESTIS BUT ADMETUS FELL ILL
WHEN HIS TIME EXPIRED REFUSED TO SURRENDER THE KINGDOM TO HIS BROTHER POLYNICES FLED TO ADRASTUS KING OF ARGOS WHO GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE AND AIDED HIM WITH AN ARMY TO ENFORCE HIS CLAIM TO THE KINGDOM THIS LED TO THE CELEBRATED EXPEDITION OF THE SEVEN AGAINST THEBES
AND TRIUMPHAL ACCLAMATIONS AND THE DAY CLOSED WITH FESTIVITY IN THE NIGHT THE ARMED MEN WHO WERE ENCLOSED IN THE BODY OF THE HORSE BEING LET OUT BY THE TRAITOR SINON
FILLING THE PLACE WITH MOURNFUL LAMENTATIONS WHEN SHE HAD RECOVERED SOME DEGREE OF COMPOSURE SHE LOOKED AROUND HER BUT THE PALACE AND GARDENS HAD VANISHED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE OPEN FIELD NOT FAR FROM THE CITY WHERE HER SISTERS DWELT
PREYED ON HER MIND AND MADE HER BEGIN TO FEEL HER PALACE AS BUT A SPLENDID PRISON WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME ONE NIGHT SHE TOLD HIM HER DISTRESS AND AT LAST DREW FROM HIM AN UNWILLING CONSENT THAT HER SISTERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO SEE HER
AND I AM NOT SATISFIED YET THAT YOU HAVE ANY CAPACITY TO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL BUT I HAVE ANOTHER TASK FOR YOU HERE TAKE THIS BOX AND GO YOUR WAY TO THE INFERNAL SHADES AND GIVE THIS BOX TO PROSERPINE
HER MORTAL FRAME COULD NOT ENDURE THE SPLENDORS OF THE IMMORTAL RADIANCE SHE WAS CONSUMED TO ASHES JOVE TOOK THE INFANT BACCHUS AND GAVE HIM IN CHARGE
AND THEY MIGHT GET A LIBERAL RANSOM FOR HIM I OBSERVED HIS DRESS HIS WALK HIS FACE THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THEM WHICH I FELT SURE WAS MORE THAN MORTAL I SAID TO MY MEN WHAT GOD THERE IS CONCEALED IN THAT FORM I KNOW NOT
IN THE FIRST COURSE HUGI SO MUCH OUT STRIPPED HIS COMPETITOR THAT HE TURNED BACK AND MET HIM NOT FAR FROM THE STARTING PLACE
VAIN THE STRUGGLE VAIN AGAINST THE COILING STRAIN AND GRIPE AND DEEPENING OF THE DRAGON'S GRASP THE OLD MAN'S CLINCH THE LONG ENVENOMED CHAIN
PSYCHE RESISTED THESE PERSUASIONS AS WELL AS SHE COULD BUT THEY DID NOT FAIL TO HAVE THEIR EFFECT ON HER MIND AND WHEN HER SISTERS WERE GONE THEIR WORDS AND HER OWN CURIOSITY WERE TOO STRONG FOR HER TO RESIST SO SHE PREPARED HER LAMP
WHEN NIGHT CAME ON THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN AN IMMENSE FOREST AND SEARCHED ON ALL SIDES FOR A PLACE WHERE THEY MIGHT PASS THE NIGHT AND AT LAST CAME TO A VERY LARGE HALL WITH AN ENTRANCE THAT TOOK THE WHOLE BREADTH OF ONE END OF THE BUILDING HERE THEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP
SAID THE YOUNG CHEVALIER INTERRUPTING HIM I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MY DEAR MAC IVOR
AND EMPLOYMENTS AND INHERITANCES OF THIS WICKED WORLD I COULD PROVE TO YOU BY THE SCRIPTURE
MOREOVER THE READER WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO IMAGINE THAT JOB HOUGHTON AND HIS DAME WERE SUITABLY PROVIDED FOR ALTHOUGH THEY COULD NEVER BE PERSUADED THAT THEIR SON FELL OTHERWISE THAN FIGHTING BY THE YOUNG SQUIRE'S SIDE SO THAT ALICK
WHICH THE HIGHLANDERS HAD NOT FAILED TO BRING OFF SUPPLIED HIM WITH LINEN AND TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE WAS WITH ALL ITS UNDIMINISHED CONTENTS FREELY RESIGNED TO HIS USE THE BEDDING OF HIS COUCH SEEMED CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE AND HIS AGED ATTENDANT CLOSED THE DOOR OF THE BED
IN AMENDS IT WAS ARRANGED THAT EDWARD WAVERLEY AND HIS LADY WHO WITH THE BARON PROPOSED AN IMMEDIATE JOURNEY TO WAVERLEY HONOUR SHOULD IN THEIR WAY SPEND A FEW DAYS AT AN ESTATE WHICH COLONEL TALBOT HAD BEEN TEMPTED TO PURCHASE IN SCOTLAND AS A VERY GREAT BARGAIN
IT ASSORTED TOO WELL WITH THE PRINCIPLES IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO INCUR REPROBATION OR EVEN CENSURE COLONEL TALBOT ALSO HAD SMOOTHED THE WAY WITH GREAT ADDRESS FOR EDWARD'S FAVOURABLE RECEPTION BY DWELLING UPON HIS GALLANT BEHAVIOUR IN THE MILITARY CHARACTER
ON WHICH SUBJECT HE UTTERED MUCH MORE SENSE THAN COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM SOME OTHER PARTS OF HIS HARANGUE AND ATTRACTED EVEN WAVERLEY'S ATTENTION WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN LOST IN HIS OWN SAD REFLECTIONS
AND OPPOSED HIS EXIT ACCOMPANYING HIS ACTION WITH SIGNS WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THERE WAS DANGER IN THE ATTEMPT AND AN ENEMY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
SWEEPING BEFORE THEM EVERY CONSIDERATION OF AN OPPOSITE TENDENCY THE TIME BESIDES ADMITTED OF NO DELIBERATION AND WAVERLEY KNEELING TO CHARLES EDWARD
I AM NOT LIKELY I THINK TO ASK ANYTHING VERY UNREASONABLE AND IF I DID THEY MIGHT HAVE STRETCHED A POINT WELL BUT YOU SHALL KNOW ALL NOW THAT I CAN DRAW MY BREATH AGAIN WITH SOME FREEDOM YOU REMEMBER MY EARL'S PATENT IT IS DATED SOME YEARS BACK
AH YOUR HONOUR HAS A NOTABLE FACULTY IN SEARCHING AND EXPLAINING THE SECRET
OF SOFTNESS AND DELICACY HOLD DIALOGUE WITH THE HOARSE INWARD CROAK OF OLD JANET FOR SO HE UNDERSTOOD HIS ANTIQUATED ATTENDANT WAS DENOMINATED HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO AMUSE HIS SOLITUDE
THE FOREMOST OF THE BAND BEING THE STOUTEST AND MOST ACTIVE HAD PUSHED ON AND HAVING SURMOUNTED THE ASCENT WERE OUT OF KEN FOR THE PRESENT GILFILLAN WITH THE PEDLAR AND THE SMALL PARTY WHO WERE WAVERLEY'S MORE IMMEDIATE GUARD
DISTRICT OF MOIDART WITH ONLY SEVEN ATTENDANTS AND OF THE NUMEROUS CHIEFS AND CLANS WHOSE LOYAL ENTHUSIASM AT ONCE PLACED A SOLITARY ADVENTURER AT THE HEAD OF A GALLANT ARMY YOU MUST ALSO I THINK HAVE LEARNED THAT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE HANOVERIAN ELECTOR
WILL YOU NOT ADD TO YOUR CIVILITIES SAID WAVERLEY AFTER HAVING MADE THE USUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HAVING THE KINDNESS TO INFORM ME WHERE I AM AND WHETHER OR NOT I AM TO CONSIDER MYSELF AS A PRISONER
WHICH MERELY GIVES DIGNITY TO THE FEELING OF THE INDIVIDUAL EXPOSED TO IT HAD SUNK UNDER THE EXTRAORDINARY AND APPARENTLY INSURMOUNTABLE EVILS BY WHICH HE APPEARED ENVIRONED AT CAIRNVRECKAN IN FACT THIS COMPOUND OF INTENSE CURIOSITY
AND TWO HIGHLANDERS ENTERED WHOM WAVERLEY RECOGNISED AS HAVING BEEN A PART OF HIS ORIGINAL ESCORT TO THIS COTTAGE THEY CONVERSED FOR A SHORT TIME WITH THE OLD MAN AND HIS COMPANION AND THEN MADE WAVERLEY UNDERSTAND BY VERY SIGNIFICANT SIGNS THAT HE WAS TO PREPARE TO ACCOMPANY THEM
INTIMATED NO PURPOSE OF PLUNDER AND WHO IN ALL OTHER POINTS APPEARED TO CONSULT HIS WELFARE AND HIS WISHES IT OCCURRED TO OUR HERO THAT DURING THE WORST CRISIS OF HIS ILLNESS A FEMALE FIGURE YOUNGER THAN HIS OLD HIGHLAND NURSE HAD APPEARED TO FLIT AROUND HIS COUCH
FOR THIS OPINION HE GAVE MOST LEARNED AND SATISFACTORY REASONS THAT THE READER MAY NOT CARE TO HEAR REPEATED HAVING ESCAPED FROM THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAVERLEY WENT TO FERGUS'S LODGINGS BY APPOINTMENT TO AWAIT HIS RETURN FROM HOLYROOD HOUSE
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT AMONG THESE NOBLES AND GENTLEMEN HE WILL FIND WORTHY ASSOCIATES IN A GALLANT ENTERPRISE AND WILL FOLLOW A MASTER WHO MAY BE UNFORTUNATE BUT I TRUST WILL NEVER BE UNGRATEFUL THE POLITIC CHIEFTAIN
THAT THE ATTACHMENT AND COURAGE OF THE CHIEFS AND GENTLEMEN ARE NOT TO BE DOUBTED AND THAT AS THEY WILL BE IN THE MIDST OF THE ENEMY THEIR CLANSMEN WILL AS SURELY FOLLOW THEM IN FINE THAT HAVING DRAWN THE SWORD WE SHOULD THROW AWAY THE SCABBARD AND TRUST OUR CAUSE TO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF BATTLES
THEY STILL HEARD HOWEVER AT A DISTANCE THE SHOUTS OF THE SOLDIERS AS THEY HALLOOED TO EACH OTHER UPON THE HEATH AND THEY COULD ALSO HEAR THE DISTANT ROLL OF A DRUM BEATING TO ARMS IN THE SAME DIRECTION BUT THESE HOSTILE SOUNDS WERE NOW FAR IN THEIR REAR
WILL MAKE A VERY GOOD FIGURE AS TO HER FATHER HE IS AN ORIGINAL IT IS TRUE AND AN ABSURD ONE ENOUGH BUT HE HAS GIVEN SUCH SEVERE LESSONS TO SIR HEW HALBERT THAT DEAR DEFUNCT THE LAIRD OF BALMAWHAPPLE AND OTHERS
FOR I AM AT THIS MOMENT TEMPTED TO CURSE MY OWN WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I MADE THIS VERY MORNING TWO SUITS TO THE PRINCE AND HE HAS REJECTED THEM BOTH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT WHAT CAN I THINK ANSWERED WAVERLEY TILL I KNOW WHAT YOUR REQUESTS WERE
WHICH FERGUS THREW FROM HIM WITH GREAT PASSION I WISH TO GOD HE SAID THE OLD DEN WOULD TUMBLE DOWN UPON THE HEADS OF THE FOOLS WHO ATTACK AND THE KNAVES WHO DEFEND IT I SEE WAVERLEY YOU THINK I AM MAD LEAVE US EVAN BUT BE WITHIN CALL
AND DIED AWAY UPON THE BREEZE AS THEY RAPIDLY PROCEEDED WHEN THEY HAD WALKED ABOUT HALF AN HOUR STILL ALONG OPEN AND WASTE GROUND OF THE SAME DESCRIPTION THEY CAME TO THE STUMP OF AN ANCIENT OAK WHICH FROM ITS RELICS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN AT ONE TIME A TREE OF VERY LARGE SIZE
IN AN ADJACENT HOLLOW THEY FOUND SEVERAL HIGHLANDERS WITH A HORSE OR TWO THEY HAD NOT JOINED THEM ABOVE A FEW MINUTES WHICH WAVERLEY'S ATTENDANT EMPLOYED IN ALL PROBABILITY IN COMMUNICATING THE CAUSE OF THEIR DELAY FOR THE WORDS DUNCAN DUROCH WERE OFTEN REPEATED
YOU MUST KNOW THAT I LEARNED ACCIDENTALLY THAT THE PRINCE HAS BEEN PRESSING THAT OLD FOOLISH BARON OF BRADWARDINE TO DISINHERIT HIS MALE HEIR OR NINETEENTH OR TWENTIETH COUSIN WHO HAS TAKEN A COMMAND IN THE ELECTOR OF HANOVER'S MILITIA
BETTER THAN HE COULD HAVE CONCEIVED FOR POULTRY AND EVEN WINE WERE NO STRANGERS TO HIS TABLE THE HIGHLANDERS NEVER PRESUMED TO EAT WITH HIM AND UNLESS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF WATCHING HIM TREATED HIM WITH GREAT RESPECT HIS SOLE AMUSEMENT WAS GAZING FROM THE WINDOW
WHICH AGITATED HIS WHOLE FRAME OF MORTALITY AS HE ENTERED THE APARTMENT HE UNBUCKLED HIS BROADSWORD AND THROWING IT DOWN WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT THE WEAPON ROLLED TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM I KNOW NOT WHAT HE EXCLAIMED
THE PRINCE FOR ALTHOUGH UNFORTUNATE IN THE FAULTS AND FOLLIES OF HIS FOREFATHERS
AND I AM EVEN AT THIS MOMENT UNCERTAIN WHETHER I CAN HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CONSIDERING MISTER WAVERLEY AS AMONG MINE HE THEN PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT BUT BEFORE EDWARD COULD ADJUST A SUITABLE REPLY OR EVEN ARRANGE HIS IDEAS AS TO ITS PURPORT THE PRINCE TOOK OUT A PAPER AND THEN PROCEEDED
JOINED TO THE DELAY OCCASIONED BY THE MODE OF TRAVELLING AT THAT PERIOD RENDERED IT CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN TWO MONTHS ERE WAVERLEY HAVING LEFT ENGLAND ALIGHTED ONCE MORE AT THE MANSION OF THE LAIRD OF DUCHRAN TO CLAIM THE HAND OF HIS PLIGHTED BRIDE
THAT MISS BRADWARDINE'S AFFECTIONS WERE ENGAGED AND HE WAS UNDER A PARTICULAR PROMISE TO FAVOUR THEM SO MY DEAR FERGUS SAID HE WITH HIS MOST GRACIOUS CAST OF SMILE
AND INDEMNITIES AND OATHS AND BONDS AND OTHER CORRUPTIONS
THE OLD GENTLEMAN PUT AN END TO THE CONTEST BY SECURING IT ON THE OUTSIDE WITH A NAIL SO EFFECTUALLY THAT THE DOOR COULD NOT BE DRAWN TILL THIS EXTERIOR IMPEDIMENT WAS REMOVED WHILE MUSING UPON THE CAUSE OF THIS CONTRADICTORY SPIRIT IN PERSONS WHOSE CONDUCT
HE MIGHT BE ABLE BY BECOMING A BORROWER OF THE NIGHT FOR AN HOUR OR TWO TO REACH IT THAT EVENING HE THEREFORE PUT FORTH HIS STRENGTH AND MARCHED STOUTLY ALONG AT THE HEAD OF HIS FOLLOWERS
BUT SINCE THE DAYS OF OUR GRANDMOTHER EVE THE GRATIFICATION OF INORDINATE CURIOSITY
YE'VE BEEN FED IN SICCAN A FAULD BELIKE NO I AM OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND SAID WAVERLEY
THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEEMS WELL RECONCILED TO AND WHAT BECOMES OF THE HOMAGE CURSE THE HOMAGE I BELIEVE ROSE IS TO PULL OFF THE QUEEN'S SLIPPER ON HER CORONATION DAY OR SOME SUCH TRASH
AND WHICH OF COURSE WOULD SUPERSEDE THAT DIFFICULTY
WHEN BEHOLD THE PEDLAR SNATCHING A MUSKET FROM THE PERSON WHO WAS NEXT HIM BESTOWED THE BUTT OF IT WITH SUCH EMPHASIS ON THE HEAD OF HIS LATE INSTRUCTOR
THAT MY PATENT MUST BE SUPPRESSED FOR THE PRESENT FOR FEAR OF DISGUSTING THAT RASCALLY COWARD AND FAINEANT NAMING THE RIVAL CHIEF OF HIS OWN CLAN WHO HAS NO BETTER TITLE TO BE A CHIEFTAIN THAN I TO BE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND WHO IS PLEASED TO SHELTER HIS DASTARDLY RELUCTANCE
WHY IT IS WELL IT IS WRITTEN CURSE NOT THE KING NO NOT IN THY THOUGHT WHY HE ANSWERED THAT TRULY HE WAS GLAD I HAD MADE HIM MY CONFIDANT TO PREVENT MORE GRIEVOUS DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HE COULD ASSURE ME UPON THE WORD OF A PRINCE
WHO HAS BEEN FREQUENT IN HIS INQUIRIES AFTER YOU THUS SAYING HE DRAGGED WAVERLEY BY THE ARM OUT OF THE GUARD CHAMBER AND ERE HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS CONDUCTED EDWARD FOUND HIMSELF IN A PRESENCE ROOM FITTED UP WITH SOME ATTEMPT AT ROYAL STATE
GARDINER'S AND HAMILTON'S WHO HAD THREATENED TO CUT TO PIECES EVERY HIGHLANDER THAT SHOULD VENTURE TO PASS STIRLING AND WHILE DISCUSSIONS WERE CARRYING FORWARD AMONG THE MAGISTRACY AND CITIZENS OF EDINBURGH WHETHER THEY SHOULD DEFEND THEMSELVES OR SURRENDER MY GOOD FRIEND LOCHIEL
AND EFFECTS A CAPTURE IN A SIMILAR WAY AND THEN A BALANCE IS STRUCK IN WHICH NEITHER IS THE GAINER SELDOM DO THEY ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH COURAGE AND HEARTY GOODWILL THE CONSTITUTION OF THE AFRICAN BEING DECIDEDLY AGAINST ANY SUCH ENERGETIC WARFARE
THE SPLENDORS OF THE TROPIC SKY BY DAY AND BY NIGHT ALL TERRESTRIAL AND CELESTIAL PHENOMENA ARE MANNA TO A MAN OF SUCH SELF ABNEGATION AND DEVOTED PHILANTHROPIC SPIRIT HE CAN BE CHARMED WITH THE PRIMITIVE SIMPLICITY OF
FROM THE BANKS I COUNTED TEN HEADS OF CROCODILES
AND HE WAS NOT A WHIT ABASHED WHEN THROUGH HIM THE CHIEF TOLD US THAT THE RUSIZI JOINED BY THE RUANDA OR LUANDA AT A DISTANCE OF TWO DAYS JOURNEY BY WATER OR ONE DAY BY LAND FROM THE HEAD OF THE LAKE FLOWED INTO THE LAKE
AND THE EFFORT TO GNAW AT THE CORN EARS HAD LOOSENED ALL HIS TEETH I PREFERRED THE CORN SCONES OF VIRGINIA WHICH TO MY MIND WERE THE NEAREST APPROACH TO PALATABLE BREAD OBTAINABLE IN CENTRAL AFRICA
I HAD DISCOVERED LIVINGSTONE AND I WAS IN HIS HOUSE I LISTENED THAT THE KNOWLEDGE DAWNING ON ME MIGHT BE CONFIRMED BY THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE I HEARD NOTHING BUT THE SULLEN ROAR OF THE SURF
AND WHEREVER HE HAS GONE AMONG THEM HE HAS SOUGHT TO ELEVATE A PEOPLE THAT WERE APPARENTLY FORGOTTEN OF GOD AND CHRISTIAN MAN ONE NIGHT I TOOK OUT MY NOTE BOOK AND PREPARED TO TAKE DOWN FROM HIS OWN LIPS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT HIS TRAVELS AND UNHESITATINGLY
EXTENDING TO THE EASTERN BANK OF THE RUSIZI FOURTH COMMENCING FROM THE WESTERN BANK OF THE RUSIZI TO THE EXTREME NORTH WESTERN HEAD OF THE LAKE WAS MUGIHEWA RUHINGA'S COUNTRY FIFTH FROM UVIRA ON THE WEST RUNNING NORTH PAST MUGIHEWA
THE BAYS TO THE EAST OF THE RUSIZI ARE OF THE SAME CONFORMATION AS THOSE ON THE WEST CAREFULLY JUDGING FROM THE WIDTH OF THE SEVERAL BAYS FROM POINT TO POINT AND OF THE SEVERAL SPITS WHICH SEPARATE THEM
SERVING ME IN PLACE OF LINEN I BEGAN TO PUT MYSELF UNDER RIGID MENTAL CROSS EXAMINATION AND TO AN ANALYZATION OF MY POSITION WHAT WAS I SENT FOR TO FIND LIVINGSTONE
WITNESSED HIS CONDUCT IN THE CAMP AND ON THE MARCH AND MY FEELINGS FOR HIM ARE THOSE OF UNQUALIFIED ADMIRATION
TAKE THAT AND THAT AND THAT STILL SUSI SLEPT AND GRUNTED
THE SECOND DAY AFTER MY ARRIVAL IN UJIJI I ASKED THE DOCTOR IF HE DID NOT FEEL A DESIRE SOMETIMES TO VISIT HIS COUNTRY
FINDING THREATS OF NO AVAIL THEY HAD RECOURSE TO STONES AND ACCORDINGLY FLUNG THEM AT US IN A MOST HEARTY MANNER
THE TIME TAKEN BY ME IN TRAVELLING UP THE NILE BACK TO JERUSALEM THEN TO CONSTANTINOPLE SOUTHERN RUSSIA THE CAUCASUS AND PERSIA WAS EMPLOYED BY LIVINGSTONE IN FRUITFUL DISCOVERIES WEST OF THE TANGANIKA AGAIN
THAT HE HAD FOUND HIS BROTHER HE ALSO STATED THAT HIS FAMILY LIVED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE NYASSA LAKE
WHO COULD HAVE BEEN CLEARED OFF THE GROUND WITH OUR REVOLVERS ALONE HAD WE DESIRED IT THE DOCTOR BARING HIS ARM SAID TO THEM THAT HE WAS NOT A MGWANA OR AN ARAB BUT A WHITE MAN THAT ARABS
WE HAD COME TO MUGIHEWA SITUATED AT THE NORTHERNMOST POINT OF THE WESTERN SHORE
FORTUNATELY AS THE DOCTOR SAYS WITH UNCTION I WAS IN A COUNTRY NOW AFTER LEAVING THE SHORES OF NYASSA WHICH THE FOOT OF THE SLAVE TRADER HAS NOT TROD IT WAS A NEW AND VIRGIN LAND AND OF COURSE AS I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND IN SUCH CASES THE NATIVES WERE REALLY GOOD AND HOSPITABLE
AFTER ME YES HOW WELL YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE NEW YORK HERALD OH WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF THAT NEWSPAPER
BESIDES SAID I THERE ARE TWO OR THREE COWARDLY CREATURES IN THE BOAT WHO IN CASE OF ANOTHER DISTURBANCE WOULD NOT SCRUPLE TO LEAVE BOTH OF US HERE FROM CAPE LUVUMBA
IN MANY OTHER WAYS THE TRAVELLER IN HIS EXTREMITY WAS KINDLY TREATED BY THE YET UNSOPHISTICATED AND INNOCENT NATIVES ON LEAVING THIS HOSPITABLE REGION IN THE EARLY PART OF DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
I THOUGHT YOU AT FIRST AN EMISSARY OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT
FIVE YEARS AND IF THE GREAT TRAVELLER LIVES TO COME HOME HIS THIRD BOOK THE GRANDEST OF ALL MUST CONTAIN THE RECORDS OF EIGHT OR NINE YEARS IT IS A PRINCIPLE WITH LIVINGSTONE TO DO WELL WHAT HE UNDERTAKES TO DO AND IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE IS DOING IT DESPITE THE YEARNING FOR HIS HOME
MEN SO CRUELLY TREATED THE ANIMALS THAT BEFORE LONG THERE WAS NOT ONE LEFT ALIVE BUT AS THIS SCHEME FAILED THEY SET ABOUT INSTIGATING THE NATIVES AGAINST THE WHITE MEN WHOM THEY ACCUSED MOST WANTONLY OF STRANGE PRACTICES
TO HIS WORK BUT YOU MAY TAKE ANY POINT IN DOCTOR LIVINGSTONE'S CHARACTER
IT WAS SUCH A LAUGH AS HERR TEUFELSDROCKH'S A LAUGH OF THE WHOLE MAN FROM HEAD TO HEEL IF HE TOLD A STORY HE RELATED IT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CONVINCE ONE OF ITS TRUTHFULNESS HIS FACE WAS SO
BUT THE ADVANCE OF THE EXPEDITION WAS OFTEN RETARDED BY THE UNWILLINGNESS OF THE SEPOYS AND JOHANNA MEN TO WORK SOON AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE EXPEDITION FROM THE COAST
WERE ABLE TO PROCEED EASILY ENOUGH BUT THE CAMELS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR ENORMOUS HEIGHT COULD NOT ADVANCE A STEP WITHOUT THE AXES OF THE PARTY CLEARING THE WAY THESE TOOLS OF FORESTERS WERE ALMOST ALWAYS REQUIRED
THE NAME GIVEN TO ITS MOST SOUTHERN EXTREMITY DRAINS A LARGE TRACT OF COUNTRY SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERNMOST SOURCE OF THE TANGANIKA IT MUST THEREFORE BE THE MOST IMPORTANT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST DOUBT MYSELF
TO BE JUST WHAT I SAY HE IS HE IS AN ARDENT GENEROUS AND TRUE MAN WELL INDEED I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM AND IT MAKES ME FEEL PROUD TO THINK THAT YOU AMERICANS THINK SO MUCH OF ME
BUT NOT BEFORE WE HAD POSTED WATCHMEN TO GUARD OUR CANOE LEST THE DARING THIEVES OF UVIRA MIGHT ABSTRACT IT IN WHICH CASE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN A PRETTY PLIGHT AND IN MOST UNENVIABLE DISTRESS
WHENEVER YOU ARE I AM AT YOUR COMMAND DON'T YOU HEAR MY MEN CALL YOU THE GREAT MASTER AND ME THE LITTLE MASTER IT WOULD NEVER DO FOR THE LITTLE MASTER TO COMMAND BY THIS TIME
MANY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN EXCEEDING HURRY TO GET HOME TO TELL THE NEWS OF THE CONTINUED EXPLORATIONS AND DISCOVERIES
GET UP SUSI WILL YOU YOU ARE IN MY BED HOW DARE YOU SIR GET DRUNK IN THIS WAY AFTER I HAVE TOLD YOU SO OFTEN NOT TO
PRECIPITOUS AND ABRUPT BUT SCENICALLY VERY PICTURESQUE THE GREATER PART OF THESE HILLS HAVE THE ROUNDED AND SMOOTH TOP OR ARE TABULARLY SUMMITED THE RIDGE ENFOLDING THESE HILLS SHOOTS OUT AT INTERVALS
THEY WERE MOSTLY ARMED WITH THE ENFIELD RIFLES PRESENTED TO THE DOCTOR BY THE BOMBAY GOVERNMENT THE BAGGAGE OF THE EXPEDITION CONSISTED OF TEN BALES OF CLOTH AND TWO BAGS OF BEADS
ORIGINALLY HE CAME FROM MUTUMBI AND HE HAS TRAVELLED FROM THAT COUNTRY INTO MUGIHEWA THE DISTRICT HE NOW GOVERNS HE HAS SEEN MWEZI THE GREAT KING OF URUNDI AND DESCRIBES HIM AS A MAN ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD AND AS A VERY GOOD MAN
THE DOCTOR ENTERED A COUNTRY WHERE THE MAZITU HAD EXERCISED THEIR CUSTOMARY MARAUDING PROPENSITIES THE LAND WAS SWEPT CLEAN OF PROVISIONS AND CATTLE
AND SEASONED OUR MEAL WITH A LITTLE MORAL PHILOSOPHY
FAMILIAR READINGS IDEAS AND ASSOCIATIONS SO THAT WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE OR BY WHATSOEVER HE WAS SURROUNDED HIS OWN WORLD ALWAYS POSSESSED MORE ATTRACTIONS TO HIS CULTURED MIND
PROMONTORIAL PROJECTIONS OF GRADUAL SLOPING OUTLINES WHICH ON THE MAP I HAVE DESIGNATED CAPES OR POINTS WHEN ROUNDING THESE POINTS UP WENT OUR COMPASSES FOR THE TAKING OF BEARINGS
TO HINT AT SUCH A THING IN CONNECTION WITH THE NAME OF DAVID LIVINGSTONE THERE IS A GOOD NATURED ABANDON ABOUT LIVINGSTONE WHICH WAS NOT LOST ON ME WHENEVER HE BEGAN TO LAUGH THERE WAS A CONTAGION ABOUT IT THAT COMPELLED ME TO IMITATE HIM
CHUMAH UPON REFERRING THE MATTER TO THE DOCTOR WAS ADVISED NOT TO GO AS HE THE DOCTOR STRONGLY SUSPECTED THAT WEKOTANI WANTED ONLY TO MAKE HIM HIS SLAVE CHUMAH WISELY WITHDREW FROM HIS TEMPTER FROM MPONDA'S THE DOCTOR PROCEEDED TO THE HEEL OF THE NYASSA
THE COUNTRY OPPOSITE TO THIS PART OF URUNDI ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGHER THAN THE NEIGHBOURING HEIGHTS NORTHWARD FROM MAGALA CAPE THE LAKE STREAMED AWAY BETWEEN TWO CHAINS OF MOUNTAINS BOTH MEETING IN A POINT ABOUT THIRTY MILES NORTH OF US
THE FOURTH PARTY HAVING GONE WITH EXTRAVAGANT MANIFESTATIONS OF DELIGHT THE MEN WERE HURRIED INTO THE CANOE AND WHEN ALL WERE SEATED AND THE LOOK OUTS EMBARKED WE QUIETLY PUSHED OFF BUT NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON AS THE CANOE WAS GLIDING FROM THE DARKENED LIGHT THAT SURROUNDED US
WE MUSTERED TEN STRONG PADDLERS AND SET OUT TO EXPLORE THE HEAD OF THE LAKE AND THE MOUTH OF THE RUSIZI WE FOUND THAT THE NORTHERN HEAD OF THE LAKE WAS INDENTED WITH SEVEN BROAD BAYS EACH FROM ONE AND A HALF TO THREE MILES BROAD
HIS FATHER THE SULTAN WAS AS INEBRIATED AS HIMSELF THOUGH NOT QUITE SO VIOLENT IN HIS BEHAVIOUR IN THE MEANTIME THE DOCTOR ARRIVED UPON THE SCENE AND SELIM HAD SLIPPED MY WINCHESTER RIFLE WITH THE MAGAZINE FULL OF CARTRIDGES INTO MY HAND
NOR EVEN SPEAK TO ME IN THE COURSE OF THE COMMON CONVERSATION I SUPPOSE HE WAS AFRAID OF REOPENING A TENDER SCAR AT THE MOMENT WHEN A RETURN TO HER GOOD GRACES HAD COMMENCED TO DRAW IT TOGETHER TEARS OF VEXATION DROPPED UPON MY BREAST AND THE GROAN I SMOTHERED IN A SIGH NEARLY WRACKED MY SOUL
IN SPITE OF MY ILL HUMOR LYCAS SAW HOW WELL MY GOLDEN CURLS BECAME ME AND BECOMING ENAMOURED ANEW BEGAN WINKING HIS WANTON EYES AT ME AND SOUGHT ADMISSION TO MY GOOD GRACES UPON A FOOTING OF PLEASURE
NEVERTHELESS THEY FIGHTING FOR REVENGE WE FOR LIFE MANY FELL ON EACH SIDE THOUGH NONE WERE MORTALLY WOUNDED AND MORE BLEEDING FROM WOUNDS RETREATED AS FROM A REAL BATTLE BUT THE FURY OF NEITHER SIDE ABATED
I DESERVE ANY PUNISHMENT YOU MAY SEE FIT TO PRESCRIBE I BETRAYED A TRUST I MURDERED A MAN I VIOLATED A TEMPLE DEMAND MY PUNISHMENT FOR THESE CRIMES SHOULD IT BE YOUR PLEASURE TO SLAY ME
WHO COULD GET UP FROM CIRCE'S BED WITHOUT HAVING TASTED PLEASURE
CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTH LYCAS WAS GREATLY DISTURBED BY THIS INFORMATION AND FLEW INTO A RAGE SO SOMEONE ABOARD MY SHIP CUT OFF HIS HAIR DID HE HE BAWLED AND AT DEAD OF NIGHT TOO
NOR DID HE PUT ON THE ARROGANCE OF A MASTER BUT SPOKE AS A FRIEND ASKING A FAVOR LONG AND ARDENTLY HE TRIED TO GAIN HIS ENDS BUT ALL IN VAIN TILL AT LAST MEETING WITH A DECISIVE REPULSE HIS PASSION TURNED TO FURY AND HE TRIED TO CARRY THE PLACE BY STORM
I BELIEVE THAT I AM A MAN BY NO MEANS UNKNOWN AND THEY DESIRE THAT SOMEHOW I WILL EFFECT A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR FORMER FRIENDS SURELY YOU DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THESE YOUNG MEN FELL INTO SUCH A SNARE BY ACCIDENT
AFTER THESE REFLECTIONS WE MADE READY TO PAY THE LAST RITES TO THE CORPSE AND LYCAS WAS BURNED UPON A FUNERAL PYRE RAISED BY THE HANDS OF ENEMIES WHILE EUMOLPUS FIXING HIS EYES UPON THE FAR DISTANCE TO GAIN INSPIRATION COMPOSED AN EPITAPH FOR THE DEAD MAN
AFTER HAVING GIVEN SOME THOUGHT TO MY MISFORTUNES AND
HE THEN BROUGHT HIS OWN SCANTY RATION INTO THE VAULT AND EXHORTED THE SOBBING MOURNER NOT TO PERSEVERE IN USELESS GRIEF
SHE BANKED HER FIRE WITH BROKEN REEDS PILED SOME PIECES OF WOOD ON TOP AND BEGAN TO EXCUSE HER DELAY ON THE GROUND THAT HER FRIEND WOULD NOT PERMIT HER TO LEAVE UNTIL AFTER THE CUSTOMARY THREE DRINKS HAD BEEN TAKEN
DID THE PRIESTESS SEEM THAT IT WAS REFLECTED IN EVERYTHING AROUND HER HER DWELLING IN PARTICULAR WAS A VERY SHRINE OF POVERTY NO INDIAN IVORY SET IN GOLD GLEAMED HERE NO TRODDEN MARBLE GLISTENED HERE
YOU WHO BOASTED BUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO OF THE STRENGTH OF YOUR COMMAND NOW YOU HAVE NOT A SINGLE PLANK LEFT OF YOUR GREAT SHIP GO ON MORTALS SET YOUR HEARTS UPON THE FULFILLMENT OF GREAT AMBITIONS GO ON SCHEMERS
HOW EASILY THEY FELL IN LOVE HOW READILY THEY FORGOT EVEN THEIR OWN SONS NO WOMAN COULD BE SO CHASTE BUT THAT SHE COULD BE ROUSED TO MADNESS BY A CHANCE PASSION
AS THOUGH FORTUNE WERE BENT UPON ANNIHILATING MY PEACE OF MIND A VOICE UPON THE SHIP'S DECK GRITTED OUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO HE FOOLED ME AFTER ALL AS THIS VOICE WHICH WAS A MAN'S AND WAS ONLY TOO FAMILIAR STRUCK MY EARS MY HEART FLUTTERED
DEAR LADY I CONFESS THAT I HAVE OFTEN GIVEN CAUSE FOR OFFENSE FOR I AM ONLY A MAN AND A YOUNG ONE TOO BUT I NEVER COMMITTED A DEADLY CRIME UNTIL TODAY YOU HAVE MY CONFESSION OF GUILT
AND HANDED ME HER MISTRESS'S TABLETS IN WHICH WERE WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING WORDS
OR DROOPING POPPIES AS AT NOON THEY PINE WHEN I HAD MADE AN END OF THIS INVECTIVE SO OUT OF KEEPING WITH GOOD TASTE I BEGAN TO DO PENANCE FOR MY SOLILOQUY
THE EFFECTS OF OUR RESENTMENT AND BE CAREFUL THAT YOU DO NOT SPOIL YOUR CASE BY OVER CONFIDENCE WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO SOW PREJUDICE AMONG US BY CALLING THEM WELL BORN AND RESPECTABLE
LEAVING THE ENDS SOMEWHAT OPEN OF COURSE SO YOU CAN BREATHE AND GET YOUR FOOD THEN I WILL RAISE A HUE AND CRY BECAUSE MY SLAVES HAVE THROWN THEMSELVES INTO THE SEA FEARING WORSE PUNISHMENT AND WHEN THE SHIP MAKES PORT I WILL CARRY YOU OUT AS BAGGAGE WITHOUT EXCITING THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION
SHE SPRANG AT US AND TORE US APART THOROUGHLY ENRAGED AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF HER LECHEROUS PASSION
HE THREW HIMSELF INTO HIS BUNK PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR HIS PUKING CURSES WE REVERTED TO OUR MELANCHOLY TRAIN OF THOUGHT AND SETTLING OURSELVES DOWN IN SILENCE WE PASSED THE REMAINING HOURS OF THE NIGHT IN FITFUL SLUMBER ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
HAS BY ME BEEN LED ABOARD YOUR SHIP
THREE TIMES I GRASPED THE TWO EDGED BLADE THE RECREANT TO CUT AWAY THREE TIMES BY FEAR MY HAND WAS STAYED AND PALSIED TERROR SAID ME NAY THAT WHICH I MIGHT HAVE DONE BEFORE TWAS NOW IMPOSSIBLE TO DO
CAN WE TRIM OUR BEARDS AFTER THE FOREIGN STYLE NO ARTIFICIAL COLOR DIRTIES THE BODY WITHOUT CHANGING IT
BUT WEAK AND EFFEMINATE YOU ARE WORN OUT LIKE A CART HORSE AT A HILL YOU HAVE LOST BOTH LABOR AND SWEAT NOT CONTENT WITH GETTING YOURSELF INTO TROUBLE YOU HAVE STIRRED UP THE WRATH OF THE GODS AGAINST ME
AND BLUSHED FURTIVELY BECAUSE I HAD SO FAR FORGOTTEN MY MODESTY AS TO INVOKE IN WORDS
AND ENDEAVOURED TO GIVE HIM SOME PROOFS OF MY LOVE BUT ALL MY PANTING AND SWEATING WERE IN VAIN HE JUMPED UP IN A RAGE AND ACCUSED MY LACK OF VIRILITY AND CHANGE OF HEART
AT LAST THE GALLANT GITON TURNED THE MENACING RAZOR AGAINST HIS OWN VIRILE PARTS AND THREATENED TO CUT AWAY THE CAUSE OF SO MANY MISFORTUNES THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR TRYPHAENA SHE PREVENTED THE PERPETRATION OF SO HORRID A CRIME BY THE OUT AND OUT PROMISE OF QUARTER
LEADING A LITTLE OLD WOMAN BY THE HAND WELL MISTER SQUEAMISH SHE CHIRPED WHEN SHE HAD GREETED ME HAVE YOU RECOVERED YOUR APPETITE IN THE MEANTIME THE OLD HAG
WHOSE REEKING PINIONS HELD THAT POISON WHICH THE FEAST OF PHINEUS CONTAMINATED ALL THE AIR ABOVE
WHAT GOOD WILL IT DO YOU WHEN I'VE INFORMED YOU THAT LYCAS OF TARENTUM IS MASTER OF THIS SHIP AND THAT HE CARRIES TRYPHAENA AS AN EXILE TO TARENTUM CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIRST I SHIVERED HORROR STRUCK AT THIS THUNDERBOLT AND
SHE SHRIEKED DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT A SERIOUS CRIME YOU'VE COMMITTED YOU HAVE SLAUGHTERED THE DELIGHT OF PRIAPUS A GOOSE THE VERY DARLING OF MARRIED WOMEN AND FOR FEAR YOU THINK THAT NOTHING SERIOUS HAS HAPPENED IF THE MAGISTRATES FIND THIS OUT
SHE REPLIED BUT I AM NOT THE SUN CHILD NOR HAS MY MOTHER EVER STAYED THE REVOLVING WORLD IN ITS COURSE AT HER PLEASURE BUT IF THE FATES BRING US TWO TOGETHER I WILL OWE HEAVEN A FAVOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
SKILLFULLY TEARING OFF THE PODS WITH HER TEETH SPAT THEM UPON THE GROUND WHERE THEY LOOKED LIKE DEAD FLIES I WONDERED THEN AT THE INGENUITY OF POVERTY AND ITS EXPEDIENTS FOR EMERGENCY SO ARDENT A FOLLOWER OF THIS VIRTUE
SOME WILY LEGACY HUNTER SHOULD DISPATCH AN AGENT TO AFRICA AND CATCH US IN OUR LIE OR EVEN SUPPOSE THE HIRELING SERVANT GLUTTED WITH PROSPERITY SHOULD TIP OFF HIS CRONIES OR GIVE THE WHOLE SCHEME AWAY OUT OF SPITE
THAT I WAS SO DISTRAUGHT WITH MY OWN MISFORTUNES THAT I KNEW NOT WHAT I WAS SAYING WHY RECALL PAST MEMORIES WHICH CAN ONLY CAUSE PAIN SAID I TO MYSELF I THEN DIRECTED ALL MY ENERGIES
AT LAST AS THE SAVAGE FURY OF THE SEA GREW MORE MALIGNANT THE TREMBLING LYCAS STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS TO ME IMPLORINGLY SAVE US FROM DESTRUCTION ENCOLPIUS HE SHOUTED RESTORE THAT SACRED ROBE AND HOLY RATTLE TO THE SHIP
AND AFTER SHAKING HER HEAD FOR A WHILE I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS HOW TO CURE THAT DISEASE SAID SHE AND FOR FEAR YOU THINK I'M TALKING TO HEAR MYSELF TALK
IF YOU ARE CONTENT WITH A FLOGGING I WILL RUN NAKED TO MY MISTRESS ONLY BEAR IN MIND THAT IT WAS NOT MYSELF BUT MY TOOLS THAT FAILED ME I WAS A SOLDIER AND READY BUT I HAD NO ARMS
THE VULTURE TEARING AT THE LIVER'S DEEP AND VITAL PARTS THAT WRACKS OUR BREASTS AND RENDS OUR VERY HEARTSTRINGS IS NOT THAT BIRD THE CHARMING POET SINGS WITH ALL HIS ARTS T'IS JEALOUSY OR HATE THAT HUMAN HEARTS STINGS
DREAMS THAT DELUDE THE MIND WITH FLITTING SHADES BY NEITHER POWERS OF AIR NOR GODS ARE SENT EACH MAKES HIS OWN AND WHEN RELAXED IN SLEEP THE MEMBERS LIE THE MIND WITHOUT RESTRAINT CAN FLIT AND RE ENACT BY NIGHT THE DEEDS THAT OCCUPIED THE DAY
I INFORMED HIM THAT I HAD MERELY SOUGHT MY PALLET TO TAKE A REST TELLING HIM MUCH OTHER GOSSIP BUT NOT A WORD ABOUT MY MISHAP AS I STOOD IN GREAT FEAR OF HIS JEALOUSY AND TO LULL ANY SUSPICION WHICH HE MIGHT ENTERTAIN I DREW HIM TO MY SIDE
OH SO YOU WOULD BUNDLE US UP LIKE WE WERE SOLID I SNEERED OUR BELLIES WOULDN'T MAKE TROUBLE FOR US OF COURSE AND WE'LL NEVER SNEEZE NOR SNORE AND ALL BECAUSE A SIMILAR TRICK TURNED OUT SUCCESSFULLY BEFORE THINK THE MATTER OVER BEING TIED UP COULD BE ENDURED FOR ONE DAY BUT SUPPOSE IT MIGHT HAVE TO BE FOR LONGER
JUST AS IF THEY COULD HEAR GOUTY PATIENTS SWEAR AT THEIR FEET RHEUMATICS AT THEIR HANDS BLEAR EYED PEOPLE AT THEIR EYES AND DO NOT THOSE WHO OFTEN STUB THEIR TOES BLAME THEIR FEET FOR ALL THEIR PAIN
GO HE SHOUTED GO QUICKLY WHILE YOU CAN BILLIE STOOD STOCK STILL GAZING AT HIM I'M GOING TO STAY SHE SCREAMED I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH HE THRUST HER THROUGH THE WINDOW
HOW DOES THIS IDEA FIT YOUR THEORY KINNEY THAT VENUS IS SIMPLY THE EARTH PLUS SEVERAL THOUSAND EXTRA GENERATIONS OF CIVILIZATION FIT ECHOED THE DOCTOR FITS LIKE A GLOVE
THEY THUNDERED FORWARD DISCHARGING THEIR BALLS AND SHELLS AS FREELY AS THEY HAD ACROSS THE SEA THEIR CHARGE WAS A MURDEROUS ONE NOT A MAN OF KLOW'S WAS ABLE TO RESIST SAVE WITH WHAT FORCE HE COULD PUT INTO HIS BARE HANDS
WERE MOST REMARKABLY ORNAMENTED THEY WERE FAIRLY COVERED WITH WHAT APPEARED AT FIRST GLANCE TO BE ABSOLUTELY LIFELIKE PAINTINGS AND SCULPTURES THEY WERE SO ARRANGED AS TO STRENGTHEN THE STRUCTURAL LINES OF THE PLACE AND OF COURSE
HE WAS BUILT MUCH LIKE ESTRA BUT SHORTER AND WITH A LITTLE MORE FLESH ABOUT THE TORSO HIS FOREHEAD BULGED DIRECTLY OVER HIS EYES INSTEAD OF ABOVE HIS EARS AS DID ESTRA'S
BUT I PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE HUBBUB I WERE GAZING UP AT THOSE INFERNAL CREATURES OF THE AIR AND MY HEART SANG WITHIN ME AS I SAW THEM CIRCLING ERRATICALLY BUT VERY SURELY DOWN TO THE EARTH
TO THE MAN WHO SHALL SUGGEST THE BEST WAY OF MEETING THEIR ATTACK I SHALL GIVE THE THIRD OF MY EMPIRE SO THEY KNEW THAT THE CASE WAS DESPERATE AS FOR MYSELF I SLEPT NOT A BIT
TURNED TO EXAMINE OTHER WORK BUT AT THE MOMENT ANOTHER VENUSIAN APPROACHED FROM THE UPPER END OF THE LOBBY WALKING SLOWLY HE CARRIED FOUR SMALL PARCELS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT AND THE EXPLORERS HAD TIME TO SCRUTINIZE HIM CLOSELY
INSTANTLY THEY IDENTIFIED IT IT WAS A CANNON SHELL AGAIN VAN EMMON LED THE WAY THEY TOOK A REASSURING GLANCE OUT THE WINDOW AT THE FAMILIAR CUBE THEN PASSED ALONG THE AISLE TOWARD THE FARTHER CORNER
I MYSELF SET THE EXAMPLE BY CHARGING THE NEAREST GROUP OF THE ENEMY ALL OF WHOM WERE MOUNTED WITHIN THE RATHER SMALL AND PERFECTLY CIRCULAR CHARIOTS WHICH THEY PREFERRED THEY WERE QUICK BUT SLIPPERY
BUT SMITH STIRRED THE DUST WITH HIS FOOT AND SHOOK HIS HEAD I'VE SEEN NO TRACKS THIS DUST HAS BEEN LYING HERE FOR WEEKS PERHAPS MONTHS
NOW AS HE WAS ABOUT TO QUIT ME THE CLOUDS WERE CLEARING AWAY AND AN OCCASIONAL STROKE OF LIGHTNING CAME DOWN ONE OF THESE HOWEVER HIT THE GROUND SUCH A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY THAT BOTH OF US COULD SMELL THE SMOKE
ONE DRAWER HELD WHAT APPEARED TO BE A ROLL OF DRAWINGS SMITH DID NOT WANT TO TOUCH THEM WITH INFINITE CARE HE BLEW OFF THE DUST WITH THE AID OF HIS OXYGEN PIPE AFTER A MOMENT OR TWO THE SURFACE WAS CLEAR
THESE GO TO THE FRIENDS DOWN BELOW HE MOVED CLOSER TO THE WINDOW BUT HIS EYES WERE ON THE DOOR A RENDING CRASH TOLD THAT THE CORRIDOR WAS NOW OPEN TO THE MOB THERE WAS A RUSH AND THEN THE STORM OF THE PEOPLE BATTERING THE LAST DOOR
FOOTNOTE THE SPECIALIST IN ARCHITECTURE AND RELATED SUBJECTS IS REFERRED TO E WILLIAMS JACKSON'S REPORT TO THE A I A FOR DETAILS OF THESE BASRELIEF PHOTOGRAPHS
ESTRA SHRILLY FROM BILLIE SHE LAID THE BABY DOWN AND STRODE TO THE VENUSIAN LET'S GET OUT OF HERE THE CAR'S ON THE BALCONY NOBODY'S IN THE WAY TO INTERFERE WHY NOT A GRINDING RIPPING JAR FROM ABOVE AND ESTRA SHOOK HIS HEAD
ESTRA TOUCHED SOMETHING WITH HIS FOOT AND A DOOR SHOT ACROSS THE CORRIDOR THERE WAS AN INSTANT'S SILENCE THEN THE THUNDER OF THE MOB HURLING ITSELF AGAINST THE DOOR THE PEOPLE WERE FAIRLY SNARLING NOW ESTRA CLOSED THE INNER DOOR
VAN EMMON STOPPED AND STARED AT THE SPOT AS THOUGH FASCINATED THE OTHERS WERE READY TO GO
BUT I MANAGED TO EMPTY MY SLINGER INTO SOME OF THEM AND TO TOPPLE THE REST
THE CONTENTS WERE LADEN WITH DUST BUT HE BRUSHED THIS OFF AND DISCLOSED A QUANTITY OF EXCEEDINGLY DELICATE INSTRUMENTS THEY WERE MORE LIKE DENTISTS TOOLS THAN MACHINISTS YET PLAINLY WERE INTENDED FOR MECHANICAL USE
ALL THAT IS GROSS AND BEMEANING IN US EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF REDUCING THE FLAVORS OF OUR FOODS TO THE LOWEST TOLERABLE POINT AND DESPITE ALL THIS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET RID OF SEX JEALOUSY
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT STOOD A LOW FLAT TOPPED DESK FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE THAT OF A PROSPEROUS REAL ESTATE AGENT
AND GAVE IT A START WITH MY FOOT THE ENDS OF THE POLE TO POLE ROD LAY CONCEALED BY BRUSH PERCHANCE FIFTY YARDS AWAY IN TEN SECONDS THAT LAST SECTION HAD ROLLED COMPLETELY BETWEEN THEM
I NOTE THESE STRANGERS MOVE QUITE FAST IT WAS EVEN SO AND AT THAT SAME INSTANT ONE OF THEM SWUNG DIRECTLY ABOVE OUR HEADS SO CLOSE THAT I COULD HEAR THE HUM OF A POWERFUL ENGINE
IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD MENTALLY AND STILL ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AS TO BODY IN SHORT I OFFER YOU THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH ITSELF THE SPEAKER PAUSED
BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOUR PEOPLE FIND THEIR WAY WITHOUT SOMETHING OF THAT KIND TO GUIDE THEM ESTRA'S SMILE DID NOT CHANGE THAT IS SOMETHING YOU WILL UNDERSTAND BETTER BEFORE LONG SAID HE
CONTAINING WHAT LOOKED TO BE A MULTITUDE OF EXCEEDINGLY SMALL DRAWERS
BECOMES LESS AND LESS AS ONE GROWS OLDER NOW MY DISCOVERY WILL PUT AN END TO YOUR BEAST ESTRA MY EXPERIMENTS TOOK THIS LAD BEFORE HE HAD BECOME A MAN AND ALLOWED HIS BRAIN TO DEVELOP WHILE HIS BODY STOPPED GROWING
WITHIN THE HOUR I HAD MADE MYSELF KNOWN TO THE FOUR AND NINETY MEN WHO WERE TO BE MY COMMAND A PICKED COMPANY ALL OF A HEIGHT AND WEIGHT WITH BODIES THAT LACKED LITTLE OF MY OWN PERFECTION
THIS TIME THERE WAS NO DROWNING THE CONFUSION THE TELEPHONE FAIRLY SHOOK WITH INNUMERABLE CRIES SHOUTS IMPRECATIONS THE FOUR GAVE UP TRYING TO HEAR AND WATCHED THE TWO VENUSIANS
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WOMEN TIS A MAN'S JOB AHEAD OF THEE AND THE FUTURE OF THE EMPIRE IS IN THY HANDS AND AS HE CLATTERED OFF FILL NOT THY HEAD WITH WONDERINGS ABOUT THE LIGHTNING
I MUST APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR CERTAIN DEFECTS IN THEIR DESIGN I INVENTED THEM UNDER PRESSURE SO TO SPEAK HAVING TO PERFECT THE WHOLE IDEA IN THE RATHER SHORT TIME THAT HAS ELAPSED SINCE YOU DOCTOR BEGAN THE SKY CAR AND
AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT OR TWO IT WAS OVER
THE VICTORY MY FIRST INTENT WAS TO LET THEM ADVANCE UNHAMPERED
AND JUST AS I HAD PLANNED WE ALL ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN SPOT ON KLOW'S COAST AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME HOUR ALTHOUGH TWO NIGHTS LATER TWAS A BRILLIANT STROKE
AND SHOWING NO SIGNS OF FEARING US SEEING THIS I BLEW A BLAST ON MY ENGINE'S WHISTLE SO THAT MY BULLIES MIGHT KNOW THAT I HAD COME IMMEDIATELY THE WORD RAN UP AND DOWN THE LINE
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH WHAT SHE WAS SAYING AND NOT WITH WHAT SHE WAS SEEING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM VAN EMMON WATCHED AND GLOWERED HE COULD NOT HEAR THE VENUSIAN LIFTED HIS HEAD SUDDENLY THE VOICES FROM THE TELEPHONE HAD SUBSIDED
DOST RECALL EDAM'S VISION OF THE CREATURES IN THE AIR OF JEOS HE WENT ON KNOWING THAT I WOULD NOT HINDER HIM NOW AS I REMEMBER IT HE SAID THEY FLEW WITH GREAT SPEED
VAN EMMON GUESSED THAT THERE WERE A HUNDRED YARDS IN A ROLL SMITH ESTIMATED IT AT THREE HUNDRED

WHERE THE LAD LIES DOWN TO REST STANDS THE TROUBLED DREAM BESIDE THERE ON THOUGHTS THAT ONCE WERE MINE DAY LOOKS DOWN THE EASTERN STEEP AND THE YOUTH AT MORNING SHINE
ON BANKS OF THAMES THEY MUST NOT SAY SEVERN BREEDS WORSE MEN THAN THEY AND FRIENDS ABROAD MUST BEAR IN MIND FRIENDS AT HOME THEY LEAVE BEHIND
THERE THERE SUSAN INTERPOSED KEITH WITH QUICKLY UPLIFTED HAND WE'LL NOT DISCUSS IT PLEASE YES I KNOW I BEGAN THE SUBJECT MYSELF AND IT WAS MY FAULT
SHE WATCHED HIM GET UP AND MOVE SLOWLY ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ROOM PICKING HIS WAY SHE WATCHED HIM PAUSE AND MOVE HESITATING FINGERS DOWN THE BACKS OF THE CHAIRS THAT HE ENCOUNTERED BUT WHEN SHE SAW HIM STOP
AND AFTER A FRUITLESS PUTTERING ABOUT THE KITCHEN SUSAN MARCHED DETERMINEDLY UPSTAIRS TO KEITH'S ROOM AT THE DOOR SHE DID HESITATE A BREATHLESS MINUTE THEN RESOLUTELY SHE PUSHED IT OPEN THE BOY FULLY DRESSED STOOD BY THE BED
KEITH IT'S MAZIE MAZIE AND DOROTHY CAROLED THE HIGH PITCHED VOICE AGAIN BUT KEITH WITH A TUG SO IMPERATIVE THAT SUSAN HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO OBEY TURNED HIS HEAD QUITE AWAY AS HE GROPED FOR THE DOOR TO GO IN IN THE HALL HE DREW A CHOKING BREATH SUSAN

CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN FOR THE SAKE OF JOHN IN DUE COURSE DANIEL BURTON AND HIS SON KEITH RETURNED FROM THE FUNERAL OF THEIR KINSWOMAN MISSUS NANCY HOLWORTHY THE TOWN AWARE NOW OF THE STUPENDOUS CHANGE THAT HAD COME TO THE FORTUNES OF THE BURTON FAMILY
THAT EVENING SUSAN SOUGHT HER EMPLOYER IN THE STUDIO DANIEL BURTON SPENT ALL HIS WAKING HOURS IN THE STUDIO NOW THE WOODS AND FIELDS WERE NOTHING BUT A BARREN DESERT OF LONELINESS TO DANIEL BURTON WITHOUT KEITH THE VERY POISE OF SUSAN'S HEAD
ALL THIS THE NURSE MENTIONED TO MISTER BURTON AND TO SUSAN AS SHE WAS LEAVING SHE WENT AWAY AT TWO O'CLOCK AND MISSUS COLEBROOK WAS NOT TO COME UNTIL HALF PAST FIVE AT ONE MINUTE PAST TWO SUSAN CREPT TO THE DOOR OF KEITH'S ROOM AND PUSHED IT OPEN SOFTLY
T AIN'T FOR ME TO PRETENSE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE INFERRIN TO BUT JEST LET ME TELL YOU THIS
EVEN TO BEAT SUSAN'S RECORD STEADFASTLY HE RESISTED ALL EFFORTS TO STIR HIM INTO INTEREST OR ACTION AND A DISMAYED DISAPPOINTED SUSAN HAD TO GO DOWNSTAIRS IN ACKNOWLEDGED DEFEAT BUT
THEY LIKE THE DARK THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE FOR THEN THEY CAN BE GREAT THEY LOOM LIKE DOOM FROM OUT THE GLOOM AN SHRIEK I AM YOUR FATE BUT AFTER ALL THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE ARE COWARDS SAY NOT YOU
AND IT WAS THE WAY YOU DID IT WITH NEVER A WORD OR A HINT THAT I WAS DIFFERENT YOU DID THINGS AND YOU MADE ME DO THINGS WITHOUT REMINDING ME ALL THE TIME THAT I WAS BLIND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT FIRST DAY WHEN YOU TOLD
YOU'D NEVER GUESS IN A MILLION YEARS SO I'M GOIN TO TELL YOU FOR THE LAST THREE MORNIN'S SHE'S TIED UP HER EYES WITH A HANDKERCHIEF AN THEN DRESSED HERSELF JEST TO MAKE SURE IT COULD BE DONE YOU KNOW SUSAN DID YOU REALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME A FAINT TRACE OF INTEREST CAME INTO THE BOY'S FACE
YOU KNOW HE HE DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE DISAGREEABLE THINGS DISAGREEABLE THINGS INDEED EXPLODED SUSAN HER FEATURES WORKING AGAIN WELL I GUESS IF HE CALLS IT DISAGREEABLE TO SEE HIS SON DRESSED UP AN WALKIN AROUND BUT KEITH INTERRUPTED HER ONCE MORE WITH AN EVEN STRONGER PROTEST
WOULD HE SEE ME DO YOU THINK HE OUGHT TO HE SEES EVERYBODY ELSE I KNOW MAZIE SAYS DOES MAZIE KNOW ABOUT YOU INTERRUPTED SUSAN I MEAN ABOUT YOUR BEING MISS STEWART
NOT EVEN USING HIS CANE TO DEFINE THE FAMILIAR LIMITS OF HIS PATHWAY SUDDENLY HE TURNED AND STOPPED SHORT HIS WHOLE BODY QUIVERING WITH EMOTION SUSAN I CAN'T I CAN'T STAND IT HE MOANED
SPELT AGGRESSIVE DETERMINATION AS SHE ENTERED THE STUDIO AND DANIEL BURTON SHIFTED UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR AS HE FACED HER NOR DID HE FAIL TO NOTE THAT SHE CARRIED SOME FOLDED PAPERS IN HER HAND YES YES SUSAN I KNOW
HIS FACE WAS ALIGHT ALMOST EAGER I DID IT I DID IT SUSAN AND IF IT HASN'T BEEN MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES I DID IT SOONER THAN YOU SUSAN TRIED TO SPEAK BUT THE TEARS WERE AGAIN CHASING EACH OTHER DOWN HER CHEEKS
SHE PAUSED DREW A LONG SIGH AND TURNED HER EYES OUT THE WINDOW UP THE WALK WAS COMING DANIEL BURTON HIS STEP WAS SLOW HIS HEAD WAS BOWED HE LOOKED LIKE ANYTHING BUT THE HAPPY POSSESSOR OF NEW WEALTH SUSAN FROWNED AS SHE WATCHED HIM
I WISH YOUR FATHER SHE BEGAN SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED
I KNOW I KNOW NODDED SUSAN IT'S THAT WAY WITH ME IN MY POETRY I JEST HAVE TO GET RIGHT AHEAD WHILE THE FUSE BURNS AN SPELL EM SOMEHOW ANYHOW SO'S TO GET EM DOWN WHILE I'M IN THE FIT OF IT
READ THEM HE MUTTERED AS CLEARLY AS HE COULD CONSIDERING THE TIGHTNESS THAT HAD COME INTO HIS THROAT AND SUSAN READ THIS SPRING OH GENTLE SPRING I LOVE THY RILLS I LOVE THY WOODEN ROCKY RILLS
HERE SURE I'M HERE BUT SO DUMB WITH AMAZEMENT AN ADMIRATION THAT I COULDN'T OPEN MY HEAD TO SEE YOU STANDIN THERE ALL DRESSED LIKE THAT WHAT DID I TELL YOU I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT NOW COME LET'S GO SEE DAD SHE WAS AT HIS SIDE NOW HER ARM LINKED INTO HIS BUT THE BOY DREW BACK
DREAMILY FIXED OUT THE WINDOW NODDED HER HEAD SLOWLY YES I S'POSE SO BUT THERE'S A LOT LEFT THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT LEFT AND EVERYTHING HE WRITES I CAN JUST SEE IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE THAT WITH MY JOHN
THE ROAR AN CRACKLIN OF THE FLAMES
BUT THE NEXT MORNING AFTER SHE HAD GIVEN KEITH HIS BREAKFAST NOT OF TOAST AND OATMEAL SHE SUGGESTED BLITHELY THAT HE GET UP AND BE DRESSED WHEN HE REFUSED SHE TRIED COAXING MILDLY THEN MORE STRENUOUSLY
DANIEL BURTON YOU AIN'T GOIN TO DEMEAN YOURSELF LIKE THAT SHE GASPED AN ARTISTICAL GENTLEMAN LIKE YOU WHY I'D RATHER WORK MY HANDS TO THE BONES THAT WILL DO SUSAN YOU MAY GO AND SUSAN WENT
STILL THE EXTRAORDINARY PALPITATING SUSAN WITH THE SHINING PLEADING EYES YES GO ON
AND PLAYING GAMES WITH ME WAS A GIRL I HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE A GIRL WHO WAS WHAT SHE PRETENDED TO BE A NEW FRIEND DOING IT ALL BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO BECAUSE SHE LIKED TO BUT KEITH I'M SURE THAT DOROTHY LIKED
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SUSAN DID GO BUT NOT YET FOR SUSAN WAS THE MATTER CLOSED
WOMEN BROUGHT HIM JELLY AND FRUIT AND MEN CLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID HOW ARE YOU MY BOY IN VOICES THAT WERE NOT QUITE STEADY
IS IT TRUE THAT BY AN BY THERE COULD BE AN OPERATOR ON THAT BOY'S EYES OPER ER OH OPERATION YES THERE MIGHT BE IF HE COULD ONLY GET STRONG ENOUGH TO STAND IT BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE SUCCESSFUL EVEN THEN BUT THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU'RE GETTIN YOURSELF ALL WORKED UP AN THEN OH MY HOW THAT NURSE WILL SCOLD I SHAN'T BE SPLENDID MOANED THE BOY I SHAN'T BE ANYTHING NOW I SHAN'T BE JERRY OR NED OR DAD
LET HIM GO DOWNTOWN AN COME BACK YOU'D THINK HE'D BEEN TO THE CIRCUS THE WONDERFUL THINGS HE'D TELL ME HE'D SEEN ON THE WAY
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN DANIEL BURTON TAKES THE PLUNGE DOCTOR STEWART'S SECOND OPERATION ON KEITH'S EYES TOOK PLACE LATE IN NOVEMBER IT WAS NOT A SUCCESS FAR FROM INCREASING HIS VISION IT LESSENED IT
WOULD IT BOTHER YOU VERY MUCH IF I ATE OUT HERE WITH YOU HE ASKED WITH ME NONSENSE YOU'LL EAT IN THE DININ' ROOM WITH YOUR DAD OF COURSE WHY WHAT WOULD HE SAY TO YOUR EATIN OUT HERE WITH ME
ON THESE TWO CHAIRS BY THE BED BUT HOW CAN I DRESS ME WHEN I CAN'T SEE A THING
AND TO THINK OF ALL THAT TO DAY BEING WASTED ON A BLIND BABY TIED TO A PICTURE PUZZLE MOANED KEITH RESUMING HIS NERVOUS PACING OF THE ROOM IF ONLY A MAN A REAL MAN COULD HAVE HEARD HIM ONE THAT COULD GO AND DO A MAN'S WORK WHY SUSAN
WHAT COULD YOU EXPECT SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF AFTER A SORROWFUL MEDITATION BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE YOU CAN'T PUT A BACKBONE INTO A JELLYFISH BY JEST SHOWIN HIM THE BONE AN THAT'S WHAT HIS AUNT HAS MADE HIM
ONLY I MADE IT FREE VERSE YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL THE RAGE NOW LIKE THIS SHE FINISHED PRODUCING FROM SOMEWHERE ABOUT HER PERSON A HALF SHEET OF NOTE PAPER ALONE AN DARK THE STUDIO WAITED
SHE PANTED COMPANY YES YOUR SON KEITH THE MAN DREW BACK PERCEPTIBLY THERE NOW DANIEL BURTON
ON HIS LIPS THE TIME WORN QUESTION ASKED BY COUNTLESS OTHER MINDS BACK FROM THAT MYSTERIOUS LAND OF DELIRIUM WHERE AM I SUSAN SPRANG TO HER FEET THEN DROPPED ON HER KNEES AT THE BEDSIDE IN YOUR OWN BED HONEY IS THAT
SHE BROUGHT THEM ALL AND READ THEM TO HIM SHE TALKED ABOUT THE YOUNG SOLDIER TOO A GREAT DEAL TO THE BLIND BOY SHE EXPLAINED TO SUSAN THAT SHE WANTED TO DO EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO GET HIM OUT OF HIMSELF AND INTEREST HIM IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE
OH KEITH WHY HE'D EVEN FORGET HIS EYES THEN IT WOULD HELP SOME KEITH DREW IN HIS BREATH AND HELD IT A MOMENT SUSPENDED AND HE'D EVEN BE HELPING US TO WIN OUT OVER THERE
HOW ABOUT THINKIN FOR ONCE WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE WANTS YOUNG MAN SUSAN CAUGHT HER BREATH AGAIN AND GLANCED FURTIVELY AT THE HALF AVERTED FACE ON THE PILLOW THEN DOGGEDLY SHE WENT ON
WHY IT'LL TAKE A MONTH TO READ ALL THIS SAID MELICK ALL THE BETTER SAID FEATHERSTONE THIS CALM WILL PROBABLY LAST A MONTH AND WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO INTEREST US
IN THE MIDST OF THIS I AWOKE IT WAS WITH A SUDDEN START AND I LOOKED ALL AROUND IN SPEECHLESS BEWILDERMENT THE FIRST THING OF WHICH I WAS CONSCIOUS WAS A GREAT BLAZE OF LIGHT LIGHT SO LATELY LOST AND SUPPOSED TO BE LOST FOREVER
AND SO BY OUR KOSEKIN LAW YOU GIVE HER UP AMONG US LOVERS NEVER MARRY SO YOU TAKE ME YOUR OWN LAYELAH AND YOU WILL HAVE ME FOR YOUR BRIDE AND MY LOVE FOR YOU IS TEN THOUSAND TIMES STRONGER THAN THAT OF THE COLD AND MELANCHOLY ALMAH
BUT LAYELAH WAS QUITE READY WITH HER REPLY IF YOU LOVE ALMAH SAID SHE THAT IS THE VERY REASON WHY YOU SHOULD MARRY ME THIS MADE ME FEEL MORE EMBARRASSED THAN EVER
BUT NOW ALL DANGER IS PAST THE PHYSICIANS SAY THAT SHE WILL SOON BE WELL THERE WERE TEARS IN HIS EYES AS HE SPOKE IT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE BRIGHT LIGHT BUT I ATTRIBUTED THIS TO HIS LOVING HEART AND I FORGOT THAT HE WAS A CANNIBAL
I RAISED MY HANDS WAVED THEM AND GAVE A CRY THE GALLEY AT ONCE STOPPED A BOAT WAS LOWERED AND SOME MEN DESCENDED AND ROWED TOWARD ME THEY WERE MEN OF STRANGE APPEARANCE VERY SMALL IN STATURE AND SLENDER IN FRAME
RISING HIGH OVER THE TOPS OF THE TREES WHILE OVERHEAD THE BRIGHTER STARS WERE PLAINLY DISCERNIBLE THE KOHEN ASCENDED THE PYRAMID AND OTHERS FOLLOWED AT THE BASE THERE WAS A CROWD OF MEN
AS THE TONES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR THEY CAUGHT THE EARS OF THOSE OUTSIDE AND SOON GREAT NUMBERS CAME INTO THE APARTMENT LISTENING IN AMAZEMENT AND IN RAPT ATTENTION EVEN THE PAINFUL LIGHT WAS DISREGARDED IN THE PLEASURE OF THIS MOST NOVEL SENSATION
SHE SEEMED TO BE GOING IN TOWARD THE SHORE AT THE VERY POINT AT WHICH I WAS AIMING AND HER COURSE AND MINE MUST SOON MEET IF I CONTINUED TO ROW AFTER SOME HESITATION I CONCLUDED TO MAKE SIGNALS TO HER SO AS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
YOU AND I ARE SINGLED OUT I HAVE BEEN RESERVED FOR YEARS UNTIL ONE SHOULD BE FOUND WHO MIGHT BE JOINED WITH ME YOU CAME I SAW IT ALL AT ONCE I HAVE KNOWN IT DREADED IT TRIED TO FIGHT AGAINST IT BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
THOSE FEARS WERE BUT TOO WELL FOUNDED FOR NOW THE DREAD CEREMONY BEGAN THE KOHEN DREW HIS KNIFE AND PLACED HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF THE STONE TABLE ONE OF THE YOUTHS CAME FORWARD STEPPED UPON IT
CHAPTER THIRTY ONE CONCLUSION IN THE MIDST OF THIS THE PAUPERS AND THE HAGS TALKED EARNESTLY TOGETHER SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN NEAREST IN RANK TO THE LATE CHIEF PAUPER AND CHIEF HAG WERE CONSPICUOUS IN THE DEBATE
TELL THEM TO PREPARE FOR US THE SPLENDID PALACES OF THE MELEKS FOR WE WILL TAKE THE MOST SUMPTUOUS AND MAGNIFICENT OF THEM ALL TELL ALL THE PEOPLE TO PRESENT THEIR OFFERINGS TELL THEM THAT WE CONSENT TO HAVE ENDLESS RETINUES OF SERVANTS SOLDIERS FOLLOWERS AND ATTENDANTS
IT WAS AS THOUGH SOME LIVING BREATHING CREATURE WERE HERE NOT FAR AWAY MOVING THROUGH THESE MIDNIGHT WATERS AND WITH THIS DISCOVERY THERE CAME A NEW FEAR THE FEAR OF PURSUIT
WHEN PRESSED BY TWO LOVERS SHOULD EXPRESS A CONFUSED WILLINGNESS TO MARRY BOTH IT WAS EVIDENT THAT LAYELAH ACCEPTED IT AS A LUDICROUS JEST LAUGHTER WAS ALL VERY WELL OF COURSE BUT I WAS SERIOUS AND FELT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO PART WITH LAYELAH WITHOUT SOME BETTER UNDERSTANDING
AND THE DULL CREAKING OF THE SPARS ALL COMBINED TO LULL INTO A STATE OF INDOLENT REPOSE THE PEOPLE ON BOARD FORWARD WERE THE CREW SOME ASLEEP OTHERS SMOKING OTHERS PLAYING CARDS
ALL LOOKED AT ME AND AT ALMAH AND POINTED TOWARD THE SUN WHICH WAS WHEELING ALONG BEHIND THE DISTANT MOUNTAIN CREST SHOWING A GOLDEN DISC THEN THEY POINTED TO THE DEAD BODIES AND THE HAGS TOOK THE CHIEF HAG
FROM THIS IT SEEMED PLAINLY EVIDENT THAT THE WATERS HAD BORNE ME INTO SOME VAST CAVERN OF UNKNOWN EXTENT WHICH WENT UNDER THE MOUNTAINS A SUBTERRANEAN CHANNEL WHOSE ISSUE I COULD NOT CONJECTURE
I HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO THIS WORLD OF WONDERS AND HERE WOULD BE MY HOME FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY DAYS THOUGH I COULD NOT NOW IMAGINE WHETHER THOSE DAYS WOULD BE PASSED IN PEACE OR IN BITTER SLAVERY AND SORROW YET THE DECISION MUST BE MADE
THE NATURE OF THE METAL WAS NOT EASILY PERCEPTIBLE FOR IT WAS COATED WITH SLIME AND COVERED OVER ABOUT HALF ITS SURFACE WITH BARNACLES AND SEA WEED
AND I WAS IN WHAT LOOKED LIKE A DEPRESSION YET I KNEW THAT THE BASIN AND THE DEPRESSION WERE AN ILLUSION AND THAT THIS APPEARANCE WAS DUE TO THE IMMENSE EXTENT OF LEVEL SURFACE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT OF LOFTY MOUNTAINS I HAD CROSSED THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE
BUT SUPPOSE THE MAN DOES NOT LOVE THE WOMAN WHY NO WOMAN WANTS TO BE LOVED SHE ONLY WANTS TO LOVE AT THIS I FELT SOMEWHAT BEWILDERED THAT SAID LAYELAH IS UNREQUITED LOVE WHICH IS THE CHIEF BLESSING HERE
OH SHE CRIED YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THE SACRIFICE IS BUT A PART IT IS BUT THE BEGINNING
PAPER BOATS BY JOVE SAID FEATHERSTONE WHAT FOR I'M GOING TO HAVE A REGATTA SAID MELICK ANYTHING TO KILL TIME YOU KNOW BY JOVE EXCLAIMED FEATHERSTONE AGAIN RAISING HIMSELF HIGHER IN HIS HAMMOCK
AND LAY DOWN ON HIS BACK WITH HIS HEAD TOWARD THE KOHEN THE MOURNFUL CHANT STILL WENT ON THEN THE KOHEN RAISED HIS KNIFE AND PLUNGED IT INTO THE HEART OF THE YOUTH I SAT FOR A MOMENT ROOTED TO THE SPOT
ABOVE ALL IN ALL AROUND ME THAT WHICH MOST IMPRESSED ME NOW WAS THE RICH AND SUPERABUNDANT LIFE AND A WARMTH OF AIR WHICH MADE ME THINK OF INDIA IT WAS AN AMAZING AND AN UNACCOUNTABLE THING
TO RISE AGAINST IT AND RESIST TO THE LAST SO I STOOD UP WITH MY RIFLE AND LISTENED WITH ALL MY SOUL IN MY SENSE OF HEARING THE SOUNDS AROSE MORE PLAINLY THEY HAD COME NEARER THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT
AND RULER OF CLOUDS AND DARKNESS HENCEFORTH YOU SHALL BE JUDGE OF DEATH TO THE MEN OF THE KOSEKIN AND SAR TABAKIN OVER THE WHOLE NATION I RECEIVED THE KNIFE IN SILENCE FOR I HAD NOTHING TO SAY
IN THAT CASE SAID OXENDEN IT MAY CONTAIN THE MANGLED REMAINS OF ONE OF THE WIVES OF SOME MOORISH PASHA BY THIS TIME THEY HAD REACHED THE YACHT AND HURRIED ABOARD ALL WERE EAGER TO SATISFY THEIR CURIOSITY
WILL REST ON US AND IN OUR LOW ESTATE AS MELEKS WE SHALL GOVERN THIS NATION IN LOVE AND SELF DENIAL TELL THEM THAT WE WILL FOREGO THE SACRIFICE AND CONSENT TO LIVE THAT WE WILL GIVE UP DARKNESS AND CAVERN GLOOM AND LIVE IN LIGHT
PARDON ME CONTINUED HE IF I HAVE SAID ANYTHING THAT MAY SEEM LIKE AN INTRUSION UPON YOUR SECRET AND MOST SACRED FEELINGS
I LOADED BOTH BARRELS OF THE RIFLE KEEPING MY PISTOL FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE AND THEN FIRED ONE OF THEM THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS REPORT THAT RANG IN MY EARS LIKE A HUNDRED THUNDER VOLLEYS AND ROLLED AND REVERBERATED FAR ALONG AND DIED AWAY IN ENDLESS ECHOES
FULL OF TERROR AND EXCITEMENT I LOADED MY RIFLE AGAIN AND WAITED LISTENING FOR A RENEWAL OF THE NOISE I FELT SURE THAT THE MONSTER BALKED OF HIS PREY WOULD RETURN WITH REDOUBLED FURY AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO RENEW THE CONFLICT
AND AT LENGTH USED TO COME AT AN EARLIER TIME WHEN ALMAH WAS PRESENT HER MANNER TOWARD ALMAH WAS FULL OF THE USUAL KOSEKIN COURTESY AND GRACIOUS CORDIALITY
A SUN THAT WOULD NEVER SET UNTIL HIS LONG COURSE OF MANY MONTHS SHOULD BE FULLY RUN MY HEART SWELLED WITH RAPTURE MY EYES FILLED WITH TEARS O LIGHT I CRIED O GLEAMING GOLDEN SUNLIGHT O LIGHT OF HEAVEN
IT WAS TO BE THE LAST SIGHT OF THE SUN FOR SIX MONTHS AND THIS WAS THE SPECTACLE UPON WHICH HE THREW HIS PARTING BEAM SO THE SUN PASSED AWAY AND THEN THERE CAME THE BEGINNING OF THE LONG DARK SEASON AT FIRST HOWEVER
ROADS WINDING FAR AWAY ALONG THE PLAIN OR UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDES AND MIGHTY WORKS OF INDUSTRY IN THE SHAPE OF MASSIVE STRUCTURES TERRACED SLOPES LONG ROWS OF ARCHES PONDEROUS PYRAMIDS AND BATTLEMENTED WALLS
AS IF ANXIOUS TO SEE HOW I ACCEPTED THIS OFFER IT WAS FOR ME A MOST EMBARRASSING MOMENT I LOVED ALMAH BUT LAYELAH ALSO WAS MOST AGREEABLE AND I LIKED HER VERY MUCH INDEED SO MUCH SO THAT I COULD NOT BEAR TO SAY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HURT HER FEELINGS
IN THE ABUNDANCE OF OUR MERCY WE ARE WILLING OURSELVES TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF ALL THE OFFERINGS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS ALL IN THE LAND MAY AT ONCE GIVE UP ONE QUARTER OF THEIR WHOLE WEALTH TO US
WITH THIS HE ATTACKED THE COPPER CYLINDER AND BY MEANS OF A FEW DEXTEROUS BLOWS SUCCEEDED IN CUTTING IT OPEN THEN HE LOOKED IN
AND MADE SOME REPLY TO THE EFFECT THAT SHE BELONGED TO A DIFFERENT RACE WITH DIFFERENT CUSTOMS BUT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW OUR CUSTOMS YOU ARE ONE OF US NOW YOU CAN EASILY FIND ANOTHER WHO WILL TAKE HIM ALMAH THREW A PITEOUS GLANCE AT ME AND SAID NOTHING
THEIR SUSPENSION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS HAD BEEN LEGALIZED UP TO THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE NEXT SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE THEY WERE NOT NOW ABLE TO RESUME
PARTY DISINTEGRATION WAS SLOW MEN WERE RELUCTANT TO ABANDON THEIR OLD TIME PRINCIPLES AND ASSOCIATIONS THE UNITED EFFORTS OF DOUGLAS AND THE ADMINISTRATION HELD THE BODY OF THE NORTHERN DEMOCRATS TO HIS FATAL POLICY
BE IT MY PROUDEST PLUME NOT THAT I WAS THE LAST TO DESERT BUT THAT I NEVER DESERTED HER I KNOW THAT THE GREAT VOLCANO AT WASHINGTON AROUSED AND DIRECTED BY THE EVIL SPIRIT THAT REIGNS THERE
AND APPARENTLY FAVORABLE TO THEIR PRO SLAVERY INTERESTS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE SOUTH
AND EXPOSING US TO THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT OF THE ALMIGHTY IN RETURN DOUGLAS MADE A MOST VIRULENT ONSLAUGHT ON THEIR POLITICAL ACTION HERE WE FIND
THE SOCIAL CONDITION OF KENTUCKY HAD CHANGED CONSIDERABLY FROM THE EARLY PIONEER DAYS LIFE HAD ASSUMED A MORE SETTLED AND ORDERLY COURSE THE OLD BARBAROUS EQUALITY OF THE EARLIER TIME WAS GONE
THE HOUSE LEADER ON THE NEBRASKA BILL AS THEIR CANDIDATE FOR SPEAKER MADE A LONG AND DETERMINED PUSH FOR SUCCESS BUT HIS HIGHEST RANGE OF VOTES WAS ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR TO SEVENTY SIX
HE SUPPORTED HIS BILL IN A PERFECTLY CHARACTERISTIC SPEECH MAKING NO EFFORT TO EVADE HIS SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRISIS AND SUBMITTING HIS VIEWS WITH DIFFIDENCE TO THE APPROVAL OF THE ASSEMBLY HIS PLAN WAS NOT ADOPTED
THE BOY ABRAHAM CLIMBED AT NIGHT TO HIS BED OF LEAVES IN THE LOFT BY A LADDER OF WOODEN PINS DRIVEN INTO THE LOGS THIS LIFE HAS BEEN VAUNTED BY POETS AND ROMANCERS AS A HAPPY AND HEALTHFUL ONE
CARLIN WAS ELECTED AND FINDING THAT A MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS STILL OPPOSED TO ANY STEPS BACKWARD HE MADE NO DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE SYSTEM AT THE FIRST SESSION LINCOLN WAS A MEMBER OF THIS BODY
ATTACKING THUS ITS MORAL AND MATERIAL SUPPORTS
WHICH MAKES IT SEEM TO THE PARTICIPANTS LEGAL AND ORDERLY THE PREACHER MET THEM WITH AN UNDAUNTED FRONT AND TOLD THEM HE MUST DO HIS DUTY AS IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT HE WAS AMENABLE TO LAW BUT NOTHING ELSE HE EVEN SPOKE IN CONDEMNATION OF MOBS
THEY TRIED TO DEFEAT IT BY LEAVING THE HOUSE IN A BODY AND THE DOORS BEING LOCKED A NUMBER OF THEM
SEND ME EVERYTHING YOU THINK WILL BE A GOOD WAR CLUB THE NOMINATION OF HARRISON TAKES FIRST RATE YOU KNOW I AM NEVER SANGUINE BUT I BELIEVE WE WILL CARRY THE STATE THE CHANCE FOR DOING SO APPEARS TO ME TWENTY FIVE PER CENT
BETTER THAN IT DID FOR YOU TO BEAT DOUGLAS A GREAT MANY OF THE GROCERY SORT OF VAN BUREN MEN ARE OUT FOR HARRISON OUR IRISH BLACKSMITH GREGORY IS FOR HARRISON
MISTER CYRUS EDWARDS BOLDLY MADE HIS CANVASS FOR GOVERNOR AS A SUPPORTER OF THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS AND HIS OPPONENT THOMAS CARLIN WAS CAREFUL NOT TO COMMIT HIMSELF STRONGLY ON THE OTHER SIDE
WILL SHOW HOW MUCH ATTENTION TO DRESS WAS PAID IN THE NEW CAPITAL CLOTHS CASSINETTS CASSIMERES VELVET SILK SATIN AND MARSEILLES VESTINGS FINE CALF BOOTS SEAL AND MOROCCO PUMPS FOR GENTLEMEN
EVERY OTHER POLITICAL SUBJECT WAS LEFT IN ABEYANCE THE MEASURE ONCE PASSED AND THE COMPROMISE REPEALED THE FIRST NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO COMBINE ORGANIZE AND AGITATE FOR ITS RESTORATION
PERSONAL CONVICTIONS IF THERE WERE DEMAGOGUES HERE AND THERE AMONG THEM SEEKING MERELY TO CREATE A BALANCE OF POWER FOR BARGAIN AND SALE THEY WERE UNIMPORTANT IN NUMBER
AFTER THE SESSION OPENED JANUARY TWENTIETH HE WROTE TO MISTER STUART ACCURATELY OUTLINING THE WORK OF THE WINTER
ON ALMOST ALL OTHER POLITICAL TOPICS THIS AFFILIATION HOWEVER WAS CONFINED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE FREE STATES IN THE SLAVE STATES
TO THE MORAL PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMUNITY AND SUBVERSIVE OF ALL CONFIDENCE IN NATIONAL ENGAGEMENTS AS A MEASURE FULL OF DANGER TO THE PEACE AND EVEN THE EXISTENCE OF OUR BELOVED UNION
IMPS WHO LIVED ON OYSTERS INSTEAD OF HONEST CORN BREAD AND BACON THE TAINT OF SLAVERY THE CONTAGION OF A PLAGUE THEY HAD NOT QUITE ESCAPED WAS ON THE PEOPLE OF ILLINOIS THEY WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO RISE ONCE IN THEIR MIGHT
THERE WAS NO REASON THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN SHOULD TAKE ESPECIAL NOTICE OF THESE RESOLUTIONS MORE THAN ANOTHER HE HAD DONE HIS WORK AT THIS SESSION IN EFFECTING THE REMOVAL OF THE CAPITAL HE HAD ONLY TO SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS AT THE VIOLENCE AND UNTRUTHFULNESS OF THE MAJORITY
IN HIS DRAFT OF THE ORDINANCE OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE NAME BECAME SINGULARLY APPROPRIATE AND WHEREVER THE FREE SOILERS SUCCEEDED IN FORMING A COALITION IT WAS ADOPTED WITHOUT QUESTION
AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH WAS THOROUGH AND THAT ELECTION DAY WAS ANXIOUSLY AWAITED MERELY TO RECORD THE POPULAR VERDICT ALREADY DECIDED THE INFLUENCE OF THIS RESULT UPON PARTIES
KNOW NOTHINGS ESSENTIALLY IT WAS A REVIVAL OF THE EXTINCT NATIVE AMERICAN FACTION BASED UPON A JEALOUSY OF AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FOREIGN BORN VOTERS
AND WHEN HIS IMPULSIVENESS WAS LET LOOSE AMONG THE ROUGH ELEMENT THAT COMPOSED HIS AUDIENCE THERE WAS A FAIR PROSPECT OF TROUBLE AT ANY MOMENT LINCOLN WAS LYING ON THE BED APPARENTLY PAYING NO ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING ON LAMBORN WAS TALKING
ADDRESS THAT ARGUMENT TO COWARDS AND SLAVES WITH THE FREE AND THE BRAVE IT WILL AFFECT NOTHING IT MAY BE TRUE IF IT MUST LET IT MANY FREE COUNTRIES HAVE LOST THEIR LIBERTY AND OURS MAY LOSE HERS BUT IF SHE SHALL
IN THIS VERY YEAR OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HE HAD FOR SOME YEARS BEEN PUBLISHING A RELIGIOUS NEWSPAPER IN SAINT LOUIS BUT FINDING THE ATMOSPHERE OF THAT CITY BECOMING DANGEROUS TO HIM ON ACCOUNT OF THE FREEDOM OF HIS COMMENTS UPON SOUTHERN INSTITUTIONS

TO A GENERAL SUSPICION THAT ALL EASTERN MEN WERE ABOLITIONISTS MISTER COOK WHO SO LONG REPRESENTED THE STATE IN CONGRESS USED TO RELATE WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT HOW HE ONCE SPENT THE NIGHT IN A FARMER'S CABIN AND LISTENED TO THE HONEST MAN'S DENUNCIATIONS OF
CALLED THE FIRST CALIFORNIA KILLED AT BALL'S BLUFF AND SOME OTHERS WHO PROTESTED AGAINST THE ACT BECAUSE FIRST IT VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLES OF FREE GOVERNMENT BY SUBJECTING THE JUDICIARY TO THE LEGISLATURE
AND RESOLVED ON FEBRUARY SECOND
ALREADY IN ACTION AND CORRESPONDENCE BORE THE BRUNT OF THE FIGHT AGAINST THE REPEAL HITHERTO ITS AIMS HAD APPEARED UTOPIAN AND ITS RESOLVES HAD BEEN DENUNCIATORY AND EXASPERATING
BY THE BANKS IN WHICH IT MAY BE HERE SAID THEY WERE FINALLY SUCCESSFUL BUT ON ONE OCCASION BEING IN THE MINORITY AND HAVING EXHAUSTED EVERY OTHER PARLIAMENTARY MEANS OF OPPOSITION AND DELAY AND SEEING THE VOTE THEY DREADED IMMINENT
WITH SCANT CEREMONY IN A LITTLE CLEARING OF THE FOREST IT IS RELATED OF YOUNG ABRAHAM THAT HE SORROWED MOST OF ALL THAT HIS MOTHER SHOULD HAVE BEEN LAID AWAY WITH SUCH MAIMED RITES
BUT ONE AND ALL REFUSED EXCEPT DAN STONE WHO WAS NOT A CANDIDATE FOR REELECTION HAVING RETIRED FROM POLITICS TO A SEAT ON THE BENCH THE RISK WAS TOO GREAT FOR THE REST TO RUN LINCOLN WAS TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD
WHO HAD DURING FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS BEEN ORGANIZED AS A DISTINCT POLITICAL BODY WITH NO NEAR HOPE OF SUCCESS BUT ANIMATED MAINLY BY THE DESIRE TO GIVE EXPRESSION TO THEIR DEEP
HE WROTE HIS PROTEST SAYING NOT ONE WORD HE WAS NOT READY TO STAND BY THEN AND THEREAFTER WASTING NOT A SYLLABLE IN RHETORIC OR FEELING KEEPING CLOSE TO LAW AND TRUTH AND JUSTICE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED IT HE SHOWED IT TO SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR ADHESION
FROM TIME TO TIME THE MOST SAVAGE ACTS WERE PASSED TO PROHIBIT THE IMMIGRATION OF FREE NEGROES INTO THE TERRITORY WHICH WAS REPRESENTED AS PINING FOR BLACK LABOR THOSE WHO HELD SLAVES UNDER THE FRENCH DOMINATION AND THEIR HEIRS
BUT THEY WERE SIMPLY THE UTTERANCES OF A YOUNG AND ARDENT WHIG EARNESTLY ADVOCATING THE ELECTION OF OLD TIPPECANOE AND NOT UNWILLING WHILE DOING THIS TO SHOW THE PEOPLE OF THE CAPITAL A SPECIMEN OF HIS ELOQUENCE
THE BOASTED FINALITY WAS A BROKEN REED THE LIFE BOAT OF COMPROMISE A HOPELESS WRECK IF THE AGREEMENT OF A GENERATION COULD BE THUS ANNULLED IN A BREATH WAS THERE ANY SAFETY EVEN IN THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF
WE RETURNED WITH OUR APRONS DECORATED WITH MUD BUT STILL HAPPY THE GOOD OLD LADY HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF THE FACT IS THAT WHEN LOUIS PLAYED WITH US HE ALWAYS ACTED AS HE DID WITH THE BOYS AT SCHOOL BUT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED
MY FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RECONCILE HIMSELF TO PRONOUNCE THE NAME OF MY MOTHER SINCE HER UNTIMELY DEATH IF
THEN WHY DID YOU RUN SO FAST TERESA ASKED I SAID NOTHING BUT SOON ROSA ALSO ARRIVED AND AFTER TEA I PUT ALL MY BOOKS IN ORDER REDRESSED MY DOLLS GOT RID OF THE INK ON MY HANDS WITH PUMICE STONE
OUR JOYS WERE HERS OUR SORROWS WERE HER SORROWS SHE HAD GROWN IN BODY AND MIND AND YET HAD KEPT THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS ALWAYS BRIGHT AND HAPPY AND FULL OF FUN SHE HAD THE SAME SIMPLE HUMBLE WAYS AS WHEN AT TEN YEARS OF AGE SHE HAD COME AMONG US
ONLY TOO GLAD TO ABANDON MY TOWEL I RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR BUT HARDLY HAD I DONE SO WHEN I REMAINED PETRIFIED AND DUMB WITH SURPRISE HARDLY ABLE TO BELIEVE MY OWN EYES THERE STOOD THE BRETON TWISTING HIS BATTERED CAP NERVOUSLY BETWEEN HIS BONY FINGERS
THAT WE USED TO SEE IN THE PARIS MAGAZINES THEY WERE KNOWN LOCALLY AS THE RED COTTAGES A LONG AVENUE OF ANCIENT ELMS SEPARATED US FROM THESE HOUSES OF OUR NEIGHBORS
THAT SHE COULD EVEN BEAT HIM AT THIS
VIBRANT WITH EMOTION HAD MOVED US ALL TO THE DEPTHS OF OUR SOULS YOU ARE A VALIANT WOMAN WITH A GREAT HEART MY FATHER SAID AS HE TOOK HER HAND I WILL WRITE THIS VERY NIGHT AND ASK THEM TO SEND THE GIRL TO US AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND I SAID TO MYSELF THAT I WOULD HONOR THE MEMORY OF MY MISTRESS BY DOING ALWAYS THAT WHICH I KNEW SHE WOULD HAVE APPROVED OF AND NOW SIR TAKE THIS LITTLE ORPHAN AS YOU KNOW YOUR GOOD WIFE WOULD HAVE DONE
HER SPECIAL SUMMER DELIGHT WAS TO RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS ALWAYS RETURNING TO THE HOUSE WITH A BIG BUNCH OF WILD FLOWERS FOR CATALINA IN ONE THING ONLY SHE ALWAYS SEEMED TO FAIL TERESA HAD A FEARFUL TASK IN TEACHING HER TO SEW AND TO KNIT
CLEARLY ENGRAVED ON THE WALLS OF MY MEMORY THERE STILL REMAINS A PICTURE OF THE GREAT GRAY HOUSE WHERE I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD IT WAS ORIGINALLY USED FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AS THE CONVENT OF THE WHITE LADIES WITH ITS FOUR LONG GALLERIES
KNOWING THAT LOUIS WAS NOT VERY COURAGEOUS I LEANED MY CHAIR AS FAR INSIDE AS I COULD AND LET HIM HAVE ONE TERRIFIC KICK AT THIS HIS FACE CHANGED COLOR AND MY FATHER NOW DISTURBED BY THE EXTRA NOISE OF MY KICK
I MUST NOT KEEP YOU ANY LONGER FOR I AM SURE YOU HAVE A GREAT DESIRE TO KNOW ABOUT PAULA AND ANYWAY I SUPPOSE YOU WILL HAVE DONE WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE AT YOUR AGE NAMELY READ THE STORY FIRST
NOT I SAID PAULA WITH A HEIGHTENED COLOR LOUIS WAS FURIOUS NO YOU SAY OH HE LAUGHED THE WALL'S TOO HIGH PAULA LOOKED AT THE WALL IT WAS CERTAINLY HIGH
MORE OR LESS SHE WILL BE AMONG US WE OPENED OUR MOUTHS TO ASK A THOUSAND QUESTIONS BUT FATHER STOPPED US NO NO THAT IS ENOUGH FOR NOW
THE REST OF THE LAND AROUND THE CONVENT HAD
IN SCHOOL I TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE IN FACT I TALKED ABOUT HER ALL DAY AND EVERY DAY I LEARNED NOTHING NOR COULD I SEEM TO DO ANYTHING AROUND THE HOUSE
THERE YOU ARE PAULA TERESA SAID DRAWING HER TO THE TABLE SIT DOWN AND EAT AND THE OTHERS SAID PAULA LOOKING AT US OH WE ATE LONG AGO SAID ROSA
WHERE RAN THE BROAD ROAD FROM ROUEN TO DARNETAL A HIGH RUGGED WALL SURROUNDED A WIDE YARD GUARDED AT THE ENTRANCE BY TWO MASSIVE DOORS STUDDED WITH ENORMOUS SPIKES THE NAKED BARRENNESS OF THIS YARD WAS TO SAY THE LEAST
SHE'S MUCH BIGGER AND STRONGER AND MORE VIGOROUS THAN EVEN I AM AND BESIDES I NEVER NEVER COULD BEAR IT TO HAVE PAULA TAKEN FROM ME HUSH HUSH CHILD DON'T SHOUT THAT WAY
I WISH TO SPEAK WITH THE MASTER HE SAID DIRECTING HIS WORDS TO TERESA
IN FACT AS I LOOK AROUND AND SEE SO MUCH SICKNESS AND SUFFERING
COME NOW WON'T YOU MY BROTHER SEEMED TO HESITATE YOU KNOW I HATED TO DISOBEY ADDED PAULA WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T LIKE TO BE A TATTLE TALE WON'T YOU PLEASE COME HOME NOW WITH ME
AND TERESA SEEMED TO HESITATE TO EXPRESS HERSELF THEN FINALLY SHE CONTINUED I CANNOT SEEM TO SHAKE OFF THE FEELING THAT SHE WILL NOT BE WITH US MUCH LONGER I BELIEVE SOMEHOW I KNOW IT SOUNDS ABSURD IN ONE WAY
PAULA DREW NEAR THE BIG CHAIR WHERE THE SICK GIRL RE CLINED CATALINA WAS SMILING SADLY AT THE YOUNG STRANGER DO YOU ALSO LOVE ME A LITTLE ASKED MY ELDEST SISTER WITH TENDERNESS AND INFINITE CARE
I DECLARE SAID ROSA THINK OF THE BRETON
BUT WHEN I GET THINKING OF THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER REALLY HAVE GIVEN YOUR HEART TO HIM AND IF ONE OF US SHOULD DIE I COULD NOT BEAR ANOTHER WORD THE VERY IDEA OF DEATH EITHER FOR PAULA OR MYSELF WAS SIMPLY UNBEARABLE STOP I CRIED
MANY THANKS FOR TELLING ME ABOUT JESUS AND HIS LOVE FOR ME SING THE SENTENCE WAS NEVER FINISHED BUT PAULA'S SWEET VOICE ROSE AS ONCE AGAIN SHE SANG THE SUBLIME WORDS
ROSA WHO WAS NOW EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WAS STUDYING IN THE CITY SHE WAS STILL THE SAME STUDIOUS FAITHFUL AND SINCERE IN ALL THAT SHE DID HER QUIET RESERVED MANNER CAUSED SOME PEOPLE TO CALL HER PROUD BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HER BETTER LOVED HER AND KNEW SHE COULD BE DEPENDED ON IN TIME OF TROUBLE
WE WERE AT TEA IN THE GARDEN TERESA OUR OLD SERVANT WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN IN HER KITCHEN SHE NEVER SEEMED TO HAVE TIME TO SIT DOWN TO EAT DEAR OLD TERESA SHE ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE A MOTHER TO ME
BUT I SCARCELY EVER ACTUALLY APPEARED IN THE SCHOOL ROOM THE STREETS IN THOSE DAYS WERE TOO ATTRACTIVE A PLAYGROUND
THE LITTLE OIL LAMP WHICH WE ALWAYS KEPT LIGHTED AT NIGHT IN THE PASSAGEWAY ILLUMINATED HIS PALE FACE AND GAUNT FIGURE GOOD EVENING MADEMOISELLE HE FINALLY MANAGED TO SAY AND THEN HE STOPPED APPARENTLY AS EMBARRASSED AS I WAS
FOR WE HAD LOST OUR OWN DEAR MOTHER WHEN I WAS STILL IN THE CRADLE MY BROTHER AND I HAD QUARRELLED OVER A MERE NOTHING WHEN WE WERE CALLED IN TO TEA BY OUR FATHER OF COURSE WE DID NOT DARE CONTINUE OUR DISPUTE OPENLY IN FRONT OF HIM
THE FOOD WHICH WE RECEIVE O LORD
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HER IF SHE SHOULD ASK ME WHERE YOU TWO WERE WELL
SAID LOUIS HE HAD JUST STARTED A THRILLING NEW GAME OF JUMPING FROM A HIGH WALL I'LL TELL YOU WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO HOME NOW ARE YOU READY HURRY UP PAULA GET THE LADDER THERE IT IS UNDER THE CHERRY TREE
I'M AFRAID THE LITTLE FOOL IS GOING TO BECOME IMPOSSIBLE NOW DO AS I DO BUT BE SURE AND DON'T BREAK YOUR NOSE FOR TERESA WILL BLAME ME YOU JUMP FIRST I SAID GETTING AFRAID ARE YOU
THAT SMILED SOFTLY AS SHE TOUCHED THEM YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HER HAIR SAID THE MOTHER AS SHE GUIDED THE GIRL'S HANDS UPWARD AND OVER THE WAVES OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR THAT SEEMED LIKE AN AURORA FIT FOR SUCH A FACE AND THEN FINALLY DOWN THE LONG BRAIDS THAT EXTENDED BELOW PAULA'S WAIST
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN THE FUTURE IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW PAULA WOULD SAY SADLY AND WOULD TAKE UP THE WORK ONCE MORE WITH SUCH SWEET RESIGNATION THAT TERESA MOVED WITH COMPASSION
TO KEEP THEM FROM STRAYING INTO OUR NEIGHBOR'S PASTURES BUT I TELL YOU NOW WE PROMISED TERESA TO RETURN AT NINE O'CLOCK AND I'M NOT GOING TO DISOBEY HER THEN IT WAS THAT I JOINED IN ON THE SIDE OF LOUIS
NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO RESIST PAULA WHEN SHE BEGINS TO SPEAK OF GOD'S LOVE SHE SEEMS TRULY INSPIRED BY HIS HOLY SPIRIT CHILD THOUGH SHE IS SHE SURELY IS HIS MESSENGER TO ALL WITH WHOM SHE COMES IN CONTACT BUT THERE'S JUST ONE THING
BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT GOD WILL CALL HER TO HIS SIDE SOME DAY SOON OH TERESA I CRIED HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH A THING
IF YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO OBEY TERESA YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A QUIET MOMENT THEN ARE YOU TOO GOING TO STAY WITH LOUIS PAULA ASKED SADLY OF COURSE CRIED LOUIS WITHOUT GIVING ME TIME TO REPLY
NONSENSE YOU FOOLISH YOUNGSTER THAT'S NOT A LIE WE'LL GO FROM HERE AT THE DOT OF NINE ACCORDING TO MY WATCH AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL TELL TERESA IN CASE SHE ASKS US OF COURSE IF SHE DOESN'T ASK US
BENDING HER GREAT FAT FORM MORE AND MORE CLOSELY OVER THE LETTER SHE BECAME MORE SERIOUS AS SHE NEARED THE BOTTOM OF THE FOURTH PAGE WHERE THE WRITING BECAME SO CLOSE AND SO FINE THAT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO DECIPHER IT
I SEEM TO HEAR A THOUSAND VOICES THAT CALL ME OUT OF DOORS I NEVER COULD SEE ANY EARTHLY REASON WHY I SHOULD HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SEW AND SO I NEVER EVEN TRIED TO PLEASE TERESA IN THAT WAY BUT NOW SHE TELLS ME THAT IF I GO ON LIKE THIS
SHE SAID IN A TREMBLING TONE AT THIS MOMENT TERESA ARRIVED CARRYING IN THE FINAL BAG AT LAST SHE SAID EMBRACING PAULA DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM THEN SEEING THAT PAULA VIEWED HER A BIT STRANGELY SHE ADDED
I DESERVED TO BE REFUSED
HER INDIFFERENCE AND SADNESS DISAPPEARED GIVING PLACE TO A QUIET PEACE AND JOY THAT WAS CONTAGIOUS FOR ALL WHO CAME IN CONTACT WITH HER
THEN JUST AS SUDDENLY
THE YEARS PASSED SWIFTLY WITHOUT BRINGING ANY GREAT CHANGES IN OUR QUIET LIFE OUR GRANDPARENTS HAD AGED A BIT AND TERESA WAS NOT QUITE AS ACTIVE AS FORMERLY WHILE A FEW WRINKLES HAD GATHERED ON OUR FATHER'S FOREHEAD BUT ALL THIS HAD COME SO SLOWLY THAT THE CHANGE WAS HARDLY NOTICED
AS SHE SLIGHTLY RAISED THE SICK GIRL'S HEAD DEAREST MARGUERITE SAID OUR TEACHER HERE ARE PAULA AND LISITA
GET ALONG WITH YOU YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN SILLY DONKEYS WITHOUT ANY SENSE IF YOU HAD ONLY DROWNED ME IN DEEPER WATER I WOULD HAVE RETURNED WITH THREE TIMES AS MANY SHEEP WHEN THE THREE ROGUES HEARD THIS THEY SAID TO HIM OH DEAR MISTER SIMON
SO THAT HE BECAME WHITE AND WAS A REMARKABLY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WHEN THE KING'S DAUGHTER SAW HIM SHE WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND NEXT DAY THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY WAS PERFORMED AND THE OLD KING BESTOWED HIS KINGDOM ON JACK MY HEDGEHOG
AND SOME MONEY TO ENABLE HIM TO TRAVEL AS HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE SOMETHING OF THE WORLD WHEN HIS REQUEST WAS GRANTED HE SET OFF ON HIS JOURNEY AND IN THE COURSE OF IT HE ONE DAY CAME TO A LARGE POND
AFTER THIS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK THE PROMISE SHE HAD MADE SO PUBLICLY SO THE KING ORDERED OUT THE STATE COACH TO TAKE HER AND THE TAILOR TO CHURCH TO BE MARRIED AS THEY WERE STARTING THE TWO BAD HEARTED OTHER TAILORS
I SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE GREATEST AGITATION AND ONLY FELL INTO A DOZE TOWARDS MORNING AS SOON AS I AWOKE I JUMPED UP AND HURRIED TO TELL MY BROTHER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED BUT HE HAD LEFT HIS ROOM AND HIS SERVANT TOLD ME THAT HE HAD GONE OUT AT DAYBREAK TO HUNT WITH THE STRANGER
HIS DAUGHTERS WERE ALL ARRANGED IN A STRAIGHT ROW IN FRONT OF HIM DRESSED EXACTLY ALIKE
UTTERED LITTLE SHRIEKS AND FLED ALL TOGETHER TO A DISTANCE FROM THE REST OF THE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY TO THE HORROR OF ALL WHO WERE LOOKING ON THE BEES PURSUED THEM
THE OLD KING WAS DELIGHTED AND EMBRACED HIS THRICE FORTUNATE SON AND HIS NEW DAUGHTER IN LAW TENDERLY AND APPOINTED THEM AS HIS SUCCESSORS TO THE THRONE BUT HE COMMANDED THE OTHER WOMEN TO BE THROWN INTO THE WATER AND DROWNED
THE WHITE SNAKE NOT VERY LONG AGO THERE LIVED A KING THE FAME OF WHOSE WISDOM WAS SPREAD FAR AND WIDE NOTHING APPEARED TO BE UNKNOWN TO HIM
THEN LITTLE TWO EYES CAME OUT FROM UNDER THE CASK QUITE HAPPILY AND THE KNIGHT WAS ASTONISHED AT HER GREAT BEAUTY AND SAID
WITHIN REACH OF HIS CLAWS THE TAILOR HOWEVER HAD NO NOTION OF BEING SCARED BUT SAID CHEERILY BRAVELY DARED IS HALF WON WHEN EVENING CAME ON HE WAS TAKEN TO THE STABLE
NO SOONER WERE THEY UNCORKED THAN THE BLUE VAPOURS POURED OUT AND BECAME TRANSFORMED TO LIVING PEOPLE IN WHOM THE LADY JOYFULLY RECOGNISED HER MANY SERVANTS AND ATTENDANTS
AND WHICH HE BOUGHT FOR SEVEN GOLD PIECES NOW IT HAPPENED THAT THERE WERE THREE MERRY RASCALS HANGING ABOUT THE MARKET PLACE WHO MUCH PREFERRED LIVING ON OTHER PEOPLE'S GOODS TO WORKING FOR THEIR OWN LIVING AS SOON AS THEY SAW THAT SIMON HAD BOUGHT A MULE ONE OF THEM SAID TO HIS TWO BOON COMPANIONS
I'LL LAY ALL THE BLAME ON YOU AND WILL PRETEND TO BE SO ANGRY WITH YOU THAT I WILL RUN AT YOU WITH MY KNIFE AND PIERCE THE BLADDER WITH IT THEN YOU MUST FALL ON THE GROUND AS IF YOU WERE DEAD AND LEAVE THE REST TO ME HARDLY HAD SIMON SAID THESE WORDS WHEN THE THREE ROGUES APPEARED AND FELL ON HIM TO KILL HIM
NOW I MUST SEE IF YOU ARE EQUALLY ACCOMPLISHED WITH YOUR HEAD
HE WAS HUNTED OUT OF THE TOWN WITH SCORN AND DERISION SHE GAVE OUT PUBLICLY THAT ALL COMERS WERE WELCOME TO TRY THEIR SKILL AND THAT WHOEVER COULD SOLVE HER RIDDLE SHOULD BE HER HUSBAND NOW IT HAPPENED THAT THREE TAILORS HAD MET TOGETHER
AND I WILL BE SO GRATEFUL TO YOU THE PRINCE LAY THE LITTLE GARMENT ON THE BANK BESIDE HER AND STEPPED BACK INTO THE BUSHES IN A FEW SECONDS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN A WHITE ROBE STOOD BEFORE HIM
DO US THE FAVOUR TO TIE US UP IN SACKS AND THROW US INTO THE RIVER THAT WE MAY GIVE UP OUR THIEVING WAYS AND BECOME THE OWNERS OF FLOCKS I AM READY ANSWERED SIMON TO DO WHAT YOU PLEASE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU
THERE WAS THE QUEEN'S RING IN HER STOMACH IT WAS EASY ENOUGH NOW FOR THE SERVANT TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE AND THE KING FEELING HE HAD DONE HIM AN INJUSTICE AND ANXIOUS TO MAKE SOME AMENDS
WHERE A THOUSAND PATHS AND ROADS CROSSED EACH OTHER THEIR PURSUERS ENTERED THE FOREST BUT SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR PRINCE MILAN AND HIS BRIDE AT LAST THEY FOUND THEMSELVES BACK AT THE SAME SPOT THEY HAD STARTED FROM
AND ONE OF HER TEARS REMAINED AS A DEWDROP AND SPARKLED ON THE LITTLE BLUE FLOWER NOW IT HAPPENED SHORTLY AFTER THIS THAT AN OLD MAN PASSED BY
THE YOUNGEST BROTHER ON THE OTHER HAND WENT ON HIS WEARY WAY FOR MANY DAYS AND NOWHERE DID HE COME ACROSS ANY LINEN THAT WOULD HAVE DONE SO HE JOURNEYED ON AND HIS SPIRITS SANK WITH EVERY STEP
SURCANTINE CAME IN ALL HASTE TO SEE WHAT SHE COULD DO FOR HER DARLING BUT HE REJECTED WITH SCORN ALL THE PORTRAITS OF LOVELY PRINCESSES WHICH SHE OFFERED HIM FOR HIS COLLECTION IN SHORT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS IN A BAD WAY
THEN IT SPED ONWARDS LIKE AN ARROW FROM A BOW IN THE MEANTIME THE MAGICIAN WAS WAITING IMPATIENTLY FOR THE PRINCE ENRAGED BY THE DELAY HE SENT HIS SERVANTS TO FETCH HIM FOR THE APPOINTED TIME WAS PAST
PASSED BY WITH HIS SERVANTS AND ESCORT WONDERING HOW HE COULD FIND HIS WAY HOME FOR THE FOREST WAS VERY VAST HE TOO HEARD THE MUSIC AND TOLD ONE OF HIS MEN TO FIND OUT WHENCE IT CAME THE MAN CAME UNDER THE TREE
THEN THE WHOLE THING DAWNED ON THE KING AND GROANING DEEPLY HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
HYACINTHIA PRINCE MILAN WENT PAST THEM AND LOOKED AT THEM CLOSELY BUT THEY WERE ALL SO PRECISELY ALIKE THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE ONE FACE REFLECTED IN THIRTY MIRRORS
LIKE THE BALES OF LINEN AND THE LITTLE DOGS THE PRINCE MARRIED PUDDOCKY AND REIGNED LONG AND HAPPILY WITH HER
I WOULD NOT SAY A WORD MORE THAN I HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY AND HE VANISHED LEAVING ME IN MY PRISON WHERE A DEEP SLEEP SOON FELL ON ME AMONGST THE MANY DREAMS WHICH FLOATED THROUGH MY BRAIN WAS A CHEERING ONE OF A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS TO COME AND RELEASE ME
COME LITTLE ONE EYE WE WILL SIT DOWN HERE AND I WILL SING YOU SOMETHING LITTLE ONE EYE SAT DOWN
HOLDING A LITTLE CRADLE IN HIS HANDS
AND MUCH COMMOTION IN THE STREETS AND A HERALD RODE ABOUT ANNOUNCING THE KING'S DAUGHTER SEEKS A HUSBAND BUT WHOEVER WOULD WOO HER MUST FIRST EXECUTE A DIFFICULT TASK AND IF HE DOES NOT SUCCEED
OR PARTOOK OF THE DISH TILL HE WAS QUITE ALONE THIS WENT ON FOR SOME TIME TILL ONE DAY THE SERVANT WHO REMOVED THE DISH WAS SO OVERCOME WITH CURIOSITY
AND GROWING SUDDENLY TO AN ENORMOUS SIZE POUNCED EACH UPON A MAIDEN AND CARRIED HER OFF INTO THE AIR AND IN AN INSTANT THEY WERE ALL LOST TO VIEW THIS AMAZING OCCURRENCE PLUNGED THE WHOLE COURT INTO THE DEEPEST AFFLICTION
WHOSE OBJECTIONS WERE NOW ENTIRELY SILENCED THEY DIVIDED THE APPLE OF LIFE AND ATE IT TOGETHER AND HER HEART GREW FULL OF LOVE FOR HIM SO THEY LIVED TOGETHER TO A GREAT AGE IN UNDISTURBED HAPPINESS
BECAUSE SHE HAD A LITTLE PINK ROSE PRINTED UPON HER WHITE THROAT FROM HER EARLIEST INFANCY SHE HAD SHOWN THE MOST ASTONISHING INTELLIGENCE AND THE COURTIERS KNEW HER SMART SAYINGS BY HEART AND REPEATED THEM ON ALL OCCASIONS
AND THE MOMENT THE WORDS HAD LEFT HIS LIPS PARIDAMIE APPEARED SMILING AND TRIUMPHANT IN THE CHARIOT OF THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES FOR BY THAT TIME THEY HAD ALL HEARD OF HER SUCCESS AND DECLARED HER TO HAVE EARNED THE KINGDOM
STEPPING UP TO ONE OF THEM HE SAW WITHIN IT WHAT LOOKED LIKE A MODEL IN MINIATURE OF A FINE CASTLE SURROUNDED BY FARMS BARNS STABLES AND A NUMBER OF OTHER BUILDINGS EVERYTHING WAS QUITE TINY
THE MOTHER SAID TO LITTLE THREE EYES THIS TIME YOU SHALL GO WITH LITTLE TWO EYES AND WATCH WHETHER SHE EATS ANYTHING OUT IN THE FIELDS AND WHETHER ANYONE BRINGS HER FOOD AND DRINK FOR EAT AND DRINK SHE MUST SECRETLY SO LITTLE THREE EYES
PRINCE MILAN LOOSENED FROM HIS NECK THE LITTLE GOLD CROSS HIS MOTHER HAD GIVEN HIM AND AS SOON AS HYACINTHIA GRASPED IT SHE HAD CHANGED HERSELF INTO A CHURCH MILAN INTO A MONK AND THE HORSE INTO A BELFRY
OH YOU WICKED MONSTER THOUGHT PRINCE MILAN YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE PUT ME TO DEATH AT ONCE SADLY HE RETURNED TO HIS ROOM AND WITH BENT HEAD
EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THE MAGICIAN SENT FOR HIM AND SAID
THE LITTLE ONES KEPT HOPING SHE MIGHT RETURN AUNT IZZIE WAS A SMALL WOMAN SHARP FACED AND THIN RATHER OLD LOOKING AND VERY NEAT AND PARTICULAR ABOUT EVERYTHING SHE MEANT TO BE KIND TO THE CHILDREN BUT THEY PUZZLED HER MUCH
RIGHT AWAY RATHER THAN HAVE MY COAT TAILS PULLED OFF ANSWERED DOCTOR CARR LAUGHING AND THEY WENT AWAY TOGETHER KATY SAT LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW IN A PEACEFUL HAPPY MOOD OH SHE THOUGHT CAN IT REALLY BE
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN TO DO ISN'T IT THE SAME THING ASKED CECY OH NO REPLIED KATY QUITE DIFFERENT FOR YOU SEE I MEAN TO DO SOMETHING GRAND
AND NOW HE AND HIS WIFE LIVE NEXT DOOR TO COUSIN HELEN AND ARE HER DEAREST FRIENDS THEIR LITTLE GIRL IS NAMED HELEN ALL THEIR PLANS ARE TALKED OVER WITH HER AND THERE IS NOBODY IN THE WORLD THEY THINK SO MUCH OF
IN PAPA IN THE CHILDREN IN YOURSELF YOU HAVE WON THE PLACE WHICH YOU RECOLLECT I ONCE TOLD YOU AN INVALID SHOULD TRY TO GAIN OF BEING TO EVERYBODY THE HEART OF THE HOUSE OH COUSIN HELEN DON'T
I DON'T LIKE TO DO THAT WE MUST JUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT BRIDGET RUN DOWN CLOVER DEAR THAT'S A GOOD GIRL
AND THE ACTIVE FIGURES OF THE LITTLE SISTERS FOLLOWING HER PROTECTINGLY BUT KATY DID NOT CONSIDER IT EITHER DROLL OR PITIFUL TO HER IT WAS SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING POSSIBLE
NARROW WINDING PATHS RAN HERE AND THERE MADE BY THE CATTLE AS THEY WANDERED TO AND FRO THIS PLACE THE CHILDREN CALLED PARADISE AND TO THEM
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE HER WAIT TILL MORNING OH SHE CAN'T THERE ARE SHE HAS I MEAN THERE WILL BE OTHER THINGS FOR HER TO DO TO MORROW IT'S A GREAT DEAL MORE CONVENIENT THAT SHE SHOULD DO IT NOW DON'T WORRY KATY DARLING BUT JUST KEEP YOUR DOOR SHUT
THE CHILDREN HADN'T ANY MAMMA SHE HAD DIED WHEN PHIL WAS A BABY FOUR YEARS BEFORE MY STORY BEGAN KATY COULD REMEMBER HER PRETTY WELL TO THE REST SHE WAS BUT A SAD SWEET NAME
KATY WAS TOO MUCH IN EARNEST NOT TO IMPROVE MONTH BY MONTH SHE LEARNED HOW TO MANAGE A LITTLE BETTER AND A LITTLE BETTER STILL MATTERS WENT ON MORE SMOOTHLY HER CARES CEASED TO FRET HER DOCTOR CARR WATCHING THE INCREASING BRIGHTNESS OF HER FACE AND MANNER
BEFORE THE ECHO OF PHIL'S BOOTS HAD FAIRLY DIED AWAY ON THE STAIRS OLD MARY PUT HER HEAD INTO THE DOOR THERE WAS A DISTRESSED EXPRESSION ON HER FACE MISS KATY SHE SAID
LIKE A SATISFIED KITTEN CLOVER WAS SUNNY AND SWEET TEMPERED A LITTLE INDOLENT AND VERY MODEST ABOUT HERSELF THOUGH IN FACT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY CLEVER IN ALL SORTS OF GAMES
YES AND NOW THE CHICKIES ARE AS COLD AND FORLORN AS YOU WOULD FEEL IF YOU TUMBLED INTO A POND AND NOBODY GAVE YOU ANY DRY CLOTHES DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO GO AND WARM THEM HOW
IT WAS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO PICK UP THE EMPTY BASKETS AND GO HOME FEELING THAT THE LONG DELIGHTFUL SATURDAY WAS OVER AND THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANOTHER FOR A WEEK BUT IT WAS COMFORTING TO REMEMBER THAT PARADISE WAS ALWAYS THERE AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT
WHEN HE CAME BACK THE CLOCK WAS JUST BEGINNING TO STRIKE THERE HE EXCLAIMED THAT'S SPLENDID ISN'T IT BUT ALAS THE CLOCK DID NOT STOP AT ELEVEN IT WENT ON TWELVE THIRTEEN
SO THEY MADE HASTE TO BUILD THE BOWER IT DID NOT TAKE LONG
SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BELONG EXACTLY TO EITHER THE OLDER OR THE YOUNGER CHILDREN THE GREAT DESIRE AND AMBITION OF HER HEART
THERE WAS A NOISE IN THE FOREST AND A DREADFUL BLACK BULL WITH FIERY EYES GALLOPED UP
ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE WOOD PILES AND BARNS AND AN ICE HOUSE BEHIND WAS A KITCHEN GARDEN SLOPING TO THE SOUTH AND BEHIND THAT A PASTURE WITH A BROOK IN IT
BUT NOBODY REPLIED AND NO ONE COULD BE SEEN THE NOSEGAY LAY ON THE PATH HOWEVER AND PICKING IT UP KATY EXHIBITED TO THE GIRLS A LONG END OF BLACK THREAD TIED TO THE STEMS
NOT ON HER FEET THAT ALAS WAS STILL ONLY A FAR OFF POSSIBILITY BUT IN A CHAIR WITH LARGE WHEELS WITH WHICH SHE WAS ROLLING HERSELF ACROSS THE ROOM THIS CHAIR WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HER SITTING IN IT SHE COULD GET TO HER CLOSET AND HER BUREAU DRAWERS
WE WANT TO GO BY SASSAFRAS PATH CRIED JOHN AND DORRY HOWEVER KATY AS USUAL HAD HER WAY IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD FIRST TRY PILGRIM'S PATH AND AFTERWARD MAKE A THOROUGH EXPLORATION OF THE WHOLE OF THEIR LITTLE KINGDOM
OR PERHAPS I SHALL GO AND NURSE IN THE HOSPITAL LIKE MISS NIGHTINGALE OR ELSE I'LL HEAD A CRUSADE AND RIDE ON A WHITE HORSE WITH ARMOR AND A HELMET ON MY HEAD AND CARRY A SACRED FLAG OR IF I DON'T DO THAT I'LL PAINT PICTURES
I'LL SEE WHAT SHE WANTS BUT CLOVER WAS ALREADY HALF WAY ACROSS THE HALL AND THE TWO GIRLS RAN UP SIDE BY SIDE THERE WAS OFTEN A LITTLE STRIFE BETWEEN THEM AS TO WHICH SHOULD ANSWER KATY'S BELL BOTH LIKED TO WAIT ON HER SO MUCH KATY CAME TO MEET THEM AS THEY ENTERED
BUT ENJOYING THE SURPRISE SHE CAUSED YOU SEE SHE EXPLAINED IN AN APOLOGIZING TONE I WAS SEIZED WITH A DESIRE TO EXPLORE IT IS SUCH A TIME SINCE I SAW ANY ROOM BUT MY OWN BUT OH DEAR HOW LONG THAT HALL IS
I MEAN TO HAVE JUST THE SAME CRIED ELSIE WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS FIRED BY THIS GORGEOUS VISION ONLY MY POND WILL BE THE BIGGEST I SHALL BE A GREAT DEAL BEAUTIFULLER TOO SHE ADDED YOU CAN'T SAID KATY FROM OVERHEAD
THE PLAY THAT AFTERNOON WAS MUCH INTERRUPTED FOR EVERY FEW MINUTES SOMEBODY HAD TO RUN IN AND SEE IF IT WASN'T FOUR O'CLOCK THE INSTANT THE HOUR CAME ALL SIX CHILDREN GALLOPED UP STAIRS
IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE CONTINUED KATY IN A MYSTERIOUS TONE THE FAIRY OF THE ROSARY WAS QUITE SICK SHE HAD TAKEN A DREADFUL COLD IN HER HEAD AND THE POPLAR TREE FAIRY JUST OVER THERE
HE WAS ALWAYS JUST AS GOOD AS HE COULD BE THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SAID IN REPLY TO THIS
THEN KATY WOULD SEND FOR EVERY RECIPE BOOK IN THE HOUSE AND PORE OVER THEM BY THE HOUR TILL HER APPETITE WAS AS COMPLETELY GONE AS IF SHE HAD SWALLOWED TWENTY DINNERS POOR DEBBY LEARNED TO DREAD THESE BOOKS SHE WOULD STAND BY THE DOOR WITH HER PLEASANT RED FACE DRAWN UP INTO A PUCKER
ASKED CLOVER NOT ALL THE TIME REPLIED KATY BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE'LL GET TIRED AND HAVE TO TAKE NAPS IN THE AFTERNOONS AND THEN OF COURSE SHE READS THE BIBLE A GREAT DEAL OH DEAR
KATY KNEW PAPA WAS RIGHT AND SHE WAS CAREFUL THOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS EASY TO BE SO WITH THAT NEW LIFE TINGLING IN EVERY LIMB HER PROGRESS WAS SLOW AS DOCTOR CARR HAD PREDICTED
A A GLASS OF ICED WATER FOR MISSUS WORRETT SHE LOOKS WARM AFTER HER WALK ELSIE DREADFULLY ASHAMED MADE A BOLT FROM THE ROOM AND HID HERSELF IN THE HALL CLOSET TO HAVE HER LAUGH OUT
THEY BEGAN WALKING UP THE RUSH AND THEN I SAW THAT THEY MOVED EXACTLY LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED GIG IN FACT IF I HADN'T BEEN TOO BIG I THINK I SHOULD HAVE HEARD THEM CREAK AS THEY WENT ALONG
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TO THEM HELEN
SHE SAID AFTER DINNER WHO IS ALEX THAT YOU AND COUSIN HELEN WERE TALKING ABOUT WHY KATY WHAT MAKES YOU WANT TO KNOW I CAN'T EXACTLY TELL ONLY COUSIN HELEN LOOKED SO AND YOU KISSED HER
HER BONNET STRINGS WERE FLYING LOOSE AS SHE CAME IN AND SHE FANNED HERSELF ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE ROOM WHICH SHOOK AS SHE WALKED
HOW IS ALEX ASKED DOCTOR CARR AT LENGTH QUITE WELL NOW REPLIED COUSIN HELEN WITH ONE OF HER BRIGHTEST LOOKS HE WAS RUN DOWN AND TIRED IN THE SPRING AND WE WERE A LITTLE ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM
BOILED CHICKEN SHE WOULD SAY COUNTING ON HER FINGERS ROAST BEEF LEG OF MUTTON BOILED CHICKEN DEBBY YOU MIGHT ROAST THE CHICKENS DEAR I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD INVENT A NEW ANIMAL WHERE ALL THE THINGS TO EAT ARE GONE TO I CAN'T IMAGINE
OH MY SHE CRIED SEE WHAT SOMEBODY'S DROPPED I'M GOING TO HAVE IT SHE STOOPED TO PICK IT UP BUT JUST AS HER FINGERS TOUCHED THE STEMS THE NOSEGAY AS IF BEWITCHED BEGAN TO MOVE
HERE ENDED THE EXTRACTS AND IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY A MINUTE HAD PASSED SINCE THEY STOPPED LAUGHING OVER THEM BEFORE THE LONG SHADOWS BEGAN TO FALL AND MARY CAME TO SAY THAT ALL OF THEM MUST COME IN TO GET READY FOR TEA
PEOPLE VERY OFTEN SAY AFTERWARD THAT THEY ALWAYS KNEW CONCLUDED KATY SAGACIOUSLY OH KATY HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WILL BE SAID CLOVER CLASPING HER HANDS CLOVER BELIEVED IN KATY AS SHE DID IN THE BIBLE
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THE WOOD SHED SINCE THE DAY OF HER FALL FROM THE SWING NEVER MIND MARY I'LL TALK TO ALEXANDER ABOUT IT AND HE SHALL MAKE IT ALL NICE MARY TROTTED DOWN STAIRS SATISFIED
IS SCHOOL GOING TO LET OUT JUST AS COUSIN HELEN'S HYMN SAID AM I GOING TO BID A SWEET GOOD BYE TO PAIN BUT THERE WAS LOVE IN THE PAIN I SEE IT NOW HOW GOOD THE DEAR TEACHER HAS BEEN TO ME
WHICH SHE WAVED TRIUMPHANTLY HURRAY SHE CRIED ALL DONE AND AUNT IZZIE SAYS WE MAY GO ARE YOU TIRED OUT WAITING
AT LEAST I HAVE LEARNED TO MODIFY THE ASSERTION ONLY TO THIS EXTENT
THOUGH YER WORDS ARE FEW YE WAD HAE ME AYE AS CARELESS TILL I CARE FOR YOU DINNA MOCK ME JEANNIE LASSIE
BY THE TIME I HAD BURROWED AS FAR AS I THOUGHT NECESSARY I WAS TIRED AND LAY DOWN AT FULL LENGTH IN MY HOLE DELIGHTING IN SUCH A SENSE OF SAFETY AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED
AND MUST PUNISH THEM TO MAKE THEM GOOD WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM NOW IN THE SILENT STARRY NIGHT A YET GREATER TERROR SEIZED ME AND I RAN STUMBLING OVER THE UNEVEN FIELD DOES MY READER
HURRIEDLY I SHOT OUT THE REMAINDER OF THE STOPPER OF STRAW AND CREPT FROM THE HOLE IN THE GREAT BARN THERE WAS BUT THE DULLEST GLIMMER OF LIGHT I HAD ALMOST SAID THE CLUMSIEST REDUCTION OF DARKNESS
JOHNNIE TURNED AND LEFT HER LISTED FOR THE WAR IN A YEAR CAM LIMPIN HAME WI MONY A SCAR
I SUPPOSE SHE WAS AWARE THAT I GREW STRONGER AND MORE DETERMINED I SOON MANAGED TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE STABLE FOR I KNEW WHERE THE KEY LAY IT WAS VERY DARK BUT I FELT MY WAY THROUGH TALKING ALL THE TIME
AFTER SUPPER WHICH WAS ENLIVENED BY SIMPLE CHAT ABOUT THE CROPS AND THE DOINGS ON THE FARM JAMES TURNED TO ME AND SAID
I'M SURE SIR SAID MISSUS MITCHELL PUTTING HER BLUE STRIPED APRON TO HER EYES I ASKED YOUR OPINION BEFORE I TOOK HIM I BELIEVE I DID SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ITS BEING TIME HE WERE ABLE TO READ
BUT COMING RAPIDLY TOWARDS ME ACROSS THE NEAREST FIELD IT ALWAYS VANISHED HOWEVER BEFORE IT CAME CLOSE THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT THE FASTER I RODE THE MORE FRIGHTENED I BECAME
SEVERAL TIMES SHE BROKE OUT ACCUSING ME OF TELLING A PACK OF WICKED LIES BUT MY FATHER TOLD HER SHE SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF DEFENDING HERSELF AND SHE MUST NOT INTERRUPT ME WHEN I HAD DONE HE CALLED TURKEY
HE WAS FAR TOO SOUND ASLEEP TO BE TROUBLED BY THE RATS FOR SLEEP IS AN ARMOUR YES A CASTLE AGAINST MANY ENEMIES I GOT HOLD OF ONE OF HIS HANDS
CHAPTER SEVEN MISSUS MITCHELL IS DEFEATED AFTER THIS TALK WITH MY FATHER I FELL INTO A SLEEP OF PERFECT CONTENTMENT AND NEVER THOUGHT OF WHAT MIGHT BE ON THE MORROW TILL THE MORROW CAME
I CLIMBED THE LADDER AND AFTER SEVERAL FAILURES SUCCEEDED IN FINDING HOW THE DOOR WAS FASTENED WHEN I OPENED IT THE MOONLIGHT GOT IN BEFORE ME
I SAW ELSIE AT CHURCH MOST SUNDAYS BUT SHE WAS FAR TOO ATTENTIVE AND MODEST EVER TO GIVE ME EVEN A LOOK SOMETIMES I HAD A WORD WITH HER WHEN WE CAME OUT BUT MY FATHER EXPECTED US TO WALK HOME WITH HIM
I WENT HOME AT A GOOD GALLOP TOOK OFF THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE AND LAID THEM IN A CART IN THE SHED TURNED MISSY LOOSE INTO THE STABLE SHUT THE DOOR AND RAN ACROSS THE FIELD TO THE MANSE
I SAT DOWN ON THE FORM NEAR THE DOOR AND KEPT VERY QUIET HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTENTION I CHERISHED I AM SURE I SHOULD HAVE CRIED WHEN THE DAME RETURNED SHE RESUMED HER BOX IRON IN WHICH THE HEATER WENT RATTLING ABOUT
SHE RETURNED RANALD BANNERMAN I ANSWERED OH SHE SAID IN A PUZZLED TONE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AT THIS TIME OF THE NIGHT
AND OTHERS WHO TAKE THINGS BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE TELL THEM SO ARE ALWAYS WALKING IN THE STRANGE MOONLIGHT
AND THE CHURCH WAS INSEPARABLY ASSOCIATED WITH MY FATHER THE PEW WE SAT IN WAS A SQUARE ONE WITH A TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT FOR OUR BOOKS MY BROTHER DAVID GENERALLY USED IT FOR LAYING HIS HEAD UPON THAT HE MIGHT GO TO SLEEP COMFORTABLY
THE IRONING OF COURSE REQUIRED A FIRE TO MAKE THE IRONS HOT AND AS THE MORNING WENT ON THE SUNSHINE ON THE WALLS CONSPIRING WITH THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH MADE THE PLACE TOO HOT FOR THE COMFORT OF THE OLD DAME SHE WENT AND SET THE DOOR WIDE OPEN
HE USED TO WALK MUCH ABOUT HIS FIELDS ESPECIALLY OF A SUMMER MORNING BEFORE THE SUN WAS UP THIS WAS AFTER MY MOTHER'S DEATH I PRESUME HE FELT NEARER TO HER IN THE FIELDS THAN IN THE HOUSE THERE WAS A KIND OF GRANDEUR ABOUT HIM I AM SURE
OR IN THE COLD WINTER NIGHTS HE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM WHERE I AND MY TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS SLEPT THE NURSERY IT WAS AND SITTING DOWN WITH TOM BY HIS SIDE BEFORE THE FIRE THAT BURNED BRIGHT IN THE FROSTY AIR WOULD OPEN THE GREAT FAMILY BIBLE ON THE TABLE
AS WE WALKED HOME TOGETHER I RESUMED THE SUBJECT I THINK YOU'RE TOO HARD ON THE KING'S SON I SAID HE COULDN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE MERMAID HE HAD NO BUSINESS TO STEAL HER COMB AND THEN RUN AWAY WITH HERSELF SAID TURKEY
I CREPT OUT OF THE HOUSE AND AWAY TO THE STABLE IT WAS A LOVELY NIGHT A KIND OF GREY PEACE FILLED EARTH AND AIR AND SKY IT WAS NOT DARK ALTHOUGH RATHER CLOUDY
THEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SPAKE LIKE A DISCONTENTED PROPHET OF OLD WHY DOESN'T HE GIVE THEM SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT THEN
AND THEREFORE ANY MODE OF LITERATURE WAS PRECIOUS THE SCHOOLMASTER WAS THE CHIEF SOURCE FROM WHICH I DERIVED MY PROVISION OF THIS SORT
I HAVE TAKEN UP A GREAT DEAL OF ROOM WITH THIS STORY OF A DREAM BUT IT CLUNG TO ME AND WOULD OFTEN RETURN AND THEN THE TIME OF LIFE TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER REFERS IS ALL SO LIKE ONE THAT A DREAM COMES IN WELL ENOUGH IN IT
LIKE PHOSPHORESCENT SPARKS IN THE SEA FOAM
AN A GLIMMER O CAULD WEET LICHT CAM OWER THE WATER STRAUCHT FRAE THE MUNE
AND PEEPING ROUND SAW THAT MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CORRECT IT WAS THE KELPIE SHE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER VERY SOFTLY AFRAID OF BEING LOCKED OUT A DANGER WHICH HAD SCARCELY OCCURRED TO ME BEFORE
WHO WAS HOBBLING AFTER ME BUT WITH THE RENEWED STRENGTH OF TRIUMPH I TURNED AGAIN FOR HOME AND RAN AS I HAD NEVER RUN BEFORE WHEN OR WHERE THE DAME GAVE IN I DO NOT KNOW
AND HE THOUGHT TO HOLD HER FAST SHE DROPPED AT HIS FEET WITHOUT MOTION OR HEED HE TOOK HER AND HOME HE SPED ALL DAY SHE LAY LIKE A WITHERED SEAWEED ON A PURPLE AND GOWDEN BED
WHO RECEIVED ME WITH NO SOFT EMBRACE IN FACT I WAS RATHER SEVERELY SCRATCHED WITH A PIN IN THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS THERE THAT SERVES YOU RIGHT SHE CRIED THAT'S A JUDGMENT ON YOU FOR TRYING TO RUN AWAY AGAIN AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE YOU GAVE US YESTERDAY TOO
WHEN I OFFERED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS TO BRING HER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE
SHE GOT ME SOME MILK HALF CREAM I DO BELIEVE IT WAS SO NICE AND SOME OATCAKE AND WENT ON WITH HER WORK WHILE I ATE I REFLECTED THAT ANY MOMENT MISSUS MITCHELL MIGHT APPEAR TO DRAG ME BACK IN DISGRACE TO THAT HORRIBLE DEN
FOR SHE AND I WERE ON THE BEST OF TERMS ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES SHE WOULD TAKE A FIT OF OBSTINACY AND REFUSE TO GO IN ANY OTHER THAN THE DIRECTION SHE PLEASED OF LATE HOWEVER SHE HAD ASSERTED HERSELF LESS FREQUENTLY IN THIS MANNER
SHE WAS NONE THE WORSE FOR IT SAID I WHO TOLD YOU THAT HE RETORTED
THAT'S WHAT COMES OF TAKING WHAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAID TURKEY IN WHOM THE PRACTICAL HAD EVER THE UPPER HAND
BUT YOU MUST BEG MISSUS MITCHELL'S PARDON FIRST AND AFTER THAT THERE WILL BE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY I FEAR BUT FATHER YOU HAVE NOT HEARD MY STORY YET WELL GO ON IT IS FAIR I SUPPOSE TO HEAR BOTH SIDES
HOW SHOULD I TELL RETURNED ANDREW THE OLD WOMAN HAS A VERY QUEER COCK I KNOW THAT ALWAYS ROOSTS ON THE TOP OF HER BED AND CROWS LIKE NO COCK I EVER HEARD CROW OR IT MIGHT BE WANDERING WILLIE
BY THEIR VERY NATURE BE ABOUT SOMETHING AMISS I HAVE OCCASIONALLY WONDERED HOW SHE WOULD HAVE BEHAVED TO A GIRL ON REFLECTION I THINK A LITTLE BETTER BUT THE GIRL WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE OFF BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED FROM HER AS WE DID
AND SHE NODDING BACK TO HIM WITH A KNOWING LOOK AND THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH DRAWN DOWN I HAVE VAGUE MEMORIES OF HAVING HEARD THEM TALK AT TIMES I FEEL AS IF I COULD YET RECALL SOMETHING OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT IT VANISHES THE MOMENT I TRY TO CATCH IT
THESE GAVE ENTIRE SATISFACTION TO THOSE OF HIS PARISHIONERS WHOM I HAPPENED TO HEAR SPEAK OF THEM BUT ALTHOUGH I LOVED THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE AND LIKED TO LOOK AT HIS FACE AS HE STOOD UP THERE IN THE ANCIENT PULPIT CLAD IN HIS GOWN AND BANDS I NEVER CARED MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE SAID
EVERYTHING WAS FROZEN BIRDS QUADRUPEDS AMPHIBIA DISAPPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC SEAL HOLES RECLOSED AND THE ICE ONCE MORE BECAME HARD AS GRANITE THE CHANGE WAS MOST STRIKING
OVERTURNED ICEBERGS AND BROKEN HUMMOCKS COVERED THE HORIZON WHILE THE FREQUENT BLOCKS OF FRESH WATER ICE SHOWED THAT SOME COAST WAS NEAR NEXT DAY AFTER A HEARTY BREAKFAST OFF THE BEAR'S PAWS THE LITTLE PARTY CONTINUED THEIR ROUTE
GLANCING UNEASILY AT THE TWO CAPTAINS
CAN'T HE STAY HERE IN FORT PROVIDENCE HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO THAT HATTERAS AND MOREOVER TO LEAVE A MAN IN THAT WAY AND NOT KNOW WHETHER WE MIGHT FIND HIM SAFE WHEN WE CAME BACK WOULD BE WORSE THAN IMPRUDENT IT WOULD BE INHUMAN ALTAMONT WILL COME WITH US
BESIDES THE SLEDGE WAS OFTEN COMING TO DIFFICULT PLACES WHEN EACH MAN WAS NEEDED TO LEND A HELPING HAND
OR HAS NOT UNDERSTOOD THE CAUSE OF THEM IT IS TEN CHANCES TO ONE BUT HE'LL COME QUICKLY BACK NEVER IMAGINING THE DANGER THE BEARS ARE SCREENED FROM SIGHT BY THE CRAG COMPLETELY
THE HUNTERS SEPARATED GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SO AS TO SURROUND THE ANIMAL AND CUT OFF ALL RETREAT THEY CREPT ALONG CAUTIOUSLY BEHIND THE HUMMOCKS
WHAT TO TAKE SOME FOOD THAT CAN'T HURT US
HE BEGAN BY UNFASTENING THE GREENLAND DOGS AND LETTING THEM OUT FOR A RUN AFTER THEIR LONG WEARISOME CONFINEMENT THEN HE ATTENDED TO DIVERS HOUSEKEEPING MATTERS HE HAD TO REPLENISH THE STOCK OF COMBUSTIBLES AND PROVISIONS
AN IMMENSE ONE IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE HORTICULTURISTS WHO CALL THEM THE PATRON SAINTS OF THE FROST AND FOR WHAT REASON BECAUSE GENERALLY THERE IS A PERIODICAL FROST IN THE MONTH OF MAY AND IT IS COLDEST FROM THE ELEVENTH TO THE THIRTEENTH
WHAT A FEAST THIS MEAL WAS TO THE POOR STARVING MEN MAY BE IMAGINED THE DOCTOR HOWEVER COUNSELLED MODERATION IN EATING AND SET THE EXAMPLE HIMSELF THIS IS A GLAD DAY FOR US HE SAID AND WE HAVE NO FEAR OF WANTING FOOD ALL THE REST OF OUR JOURNEY
WE MUST KNOW HOW FAR NEW AMERICA EXTENDS HATTERAS LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIS RIVAL BUT SAID NOTHING
AND WERE ALL COVERED ON THE EASTERN SIDE WITH BRIGHT RED SNOW IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE THE SURPRISE AND HALF TERRIFIED EXCLAMATIONS OF THE LITTLE COMPANY AT THE SIGHT OF THIS LONG RED CURTAIN
IT QUITE ACCOUNTS FOR ALL THE JOURNALS OF ARCTIC TRAVELLERS BEING SO FULL OF EATING AND DRINKING YOU ARE RIGHT RETURNED THE DOCTOR I HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE SAME FACT BUT I THINK IT ARISES NOT ONLY FROM THE NECESSITY OF FULL DIET BUT FROM THE EXTREME DIFFICULTY
AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS HATTERAS AND HIS COMPANIONS HOWEVER MARCHED STOICALLY ON AND EVEN HAILED THE DOWNPOUR WITH DELIGHT KNOWING THAT IT WOULD HASTEN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE SNOW
HE SUCCEEDED THOUGH WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN REACHING THE TOP WHICH HE FOUND TERMINATED ABRUPTLY IN A SORT OF TRUNCATED CONE
AND THE HARD SNOW SO FAVOURED THEIR MARCH THAT IN THREE HOURS THEY HAD GONE FIFTEEN MILES DUK JUMPING AND BARKING BESIDE THEM ALL THE WAY
DO YOU LOOK ON ME AS A TRUE HEARTED ENGLISHMAN LIKE YOURSELF ANXIOUS FOR HIS COUNTRY'S GLORY HATTERAS LOOKED SURPRISED BUT SIMPLY SAID I DO
AND I MUST SAY THE MAN HAS NOT SHOWN HIMSELF VERY GRATEFUL I AM HERE FORTUNATELY MISTER CLAWBONNY SAID JOHNSON NOW THIS YANKEE HAS COME BACK TO LIFE AGAIN I MUST CONFESS I DON'T MUCH LIKE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE
AH IT IS THE BOAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT AND THAT MAN HATTERAS LET US DISCUSS THE QUESTION CALMLY AND EXAMINE THE CASE ON ALL SIDES THE COAST ON WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES AT PRESENT MAY TERMINATE ABRUPTLY
CLAWBONNY DETERMINED TO HAVE A TALK WITH THE CAPTAIN ON AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT THE BUILDING OF A SLOOP OUT OF THE PLANKS OF THE PORPOISE THE DOCTOR HARDLY KNEW HOW TO BEGIN AS HATTERAS HAD DECLARED SO VEHEMENTLY THAT HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO USE A MORSEL OF AMERICAN WOOD
TO GO OUT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND THE THICK WALLS EXCLUDED ALL SOUND ALTAMONT WALKED IMPATIENTLY UP AND DOWN FULL OF EXASPERATION AND EXCITEMENT AT FINDING HIMSELF WORSTED FOR ONCE HATTERAS COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE DOCTOR
AN INTENSE BRILLIANT LIGHT STREAMED FROM THE LANTERN AND ILLUMINED THE ENTIRE PLATEAU AND THE PLAINS BENEATH JOHNSON COULD NOT HELP CLAPPING HIS HANDS HALF BESIDE HIMSELF WITH DELIGHT WELL I DECLARE MISTER CLAWBONNY HE EXCLAIMED YOU'RE OUR SUN NOW
NO MY FRIEND I DON'T IT IS A LAST BLOW FROM THE COLD YOU SEE THESE ARE HIS DOMINIONS AND HE WON'T BE DRIVEN OUT WITHOUT MAKING SOME RESISTANCE HE CAN DEFEND HIMSELF PRETTY WELL SAID BELL RUBBING HIS FACE YES BUT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED
SEVERAL NAVIGATORS HAVE MENTIONED THE FACT AND THE DOCTOR'S OWN EXPERIENCE CONFIRMED IT JOHNSON TOOK CARE NOT TO LET HIS GREENLANDERS LOOSE OF DUK THERE WAS LITTLE FEAR NOTHING COULD TAKE HIM IN FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT
THEY CAN EXPAND AT WILL AND I MAY ADD CONTRACT AT WILL SO THAT THEY CAN ENDURE STARVATION QUITE AS WELL AS ABUNDANCE WHEN AN ESQUIMAUX SITS DOWN TO DINNER HE IS QUITE THIN AND BY THE TIME HE HAS FINISHED HE IS SO CORPULENT YOU WOULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE HIM
BUT THE ROAD BECAME TOILSOME AND FATIGUING ALTAMONT LAY WATCHING THE HORIZON WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SHARED BY ALL HIS COMPANIONS FOR ACCORDING TO THE LAST RECKONING MADE BY HATTERAS
INVIGORATING REGIMEN CERTAINLY SAID BELL NOT SO MUCH AS YOU IMAGINE MY FRIEND AN INDIAN WHO GUZZLES LIKE THAT CAN'T DO A WHIT BETTER DAY'S WORK THAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO HAS HIS POUND OF BEEF AND PINT OF BEER THINGS ARE BEST AS THEY ARE THEN MISTER CLAWBONNY
I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF HE DOES NOT SUSPECT THE PROJECTS OF HATTERAS DO YOU THINK HIS OWN WERE SIMILAR WHO KNOWS
THE DOCTOR TRIED TO BLOW THE EMBERS INTO A FLAME BUT FINDING HE COULD NOT EVEN GET A RED SPARK HE WENT OUT TO THE SLEDGE TO FETCH TINDER AND GET THE STEEL FROM JOHNSON THE OLD SAILOR PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET BUT WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE STEEL MISSING
AND EVERY MOVEMENT WAS SO PERFECT AN IMITATION OF A SEAL THAT EVEN THE DOCTOR WOULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN IT WAS HATTERAS IT IS CAPITAL SAID JOHNSON IN A LOW VOICE THE BEAR HAD INSTANTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE SUPPOSED SEAL FOR HE GATHERED HIMSELF UP
THE POKER WAS AGAIN THRUST INTO THE FIRE AND IN A FEW MINUTES WAS READY FOR HATTERAS TO RECOMMENCE OPERATIONS ALTAMONT AND BELL RELOADED THEIR GUNS AND TOOK THEIR PLACES BUT THIS TIME THE POKER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH
BRUIN WENT TO WORK WITH EXTREME PRUDENCE THOUGH HIS EYES GLARED WITH GREEDY DESIRE TO CLUTCH THE COVETED PREY FOR HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN FASTING A MONTH IF NOT TWO HE ALLOWED HIS VICTIM TO GET WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM AND THEN SPRANG FORWARD WITH A TREMENDOUS BOUND
SPEAKING TO HIMSELF ABSORBED IN HIS OWN REFLECTIONS YES THAT MIGHT DO AT A PINCH WHY NOT WE MIGHT TRY WHAT ARE YOU DREAMING ABOUT ASKED HATTERAS
WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT IT STRETCHES RIGHT AWAY TO THE POLE INDEED IF YOUR PRESENT INFORMATION PROVE CORRECT WE OUGHT TO COME TO AN OPEN SEA DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WELL SUPPOSING WE REACH THIS ARCTIC OCEAN AND FIND IT FREE FROM ICE AND EASY TO NAVIGATE
I HOPE I MAY MANAGE IT JOHNSON THE JOURNEY PROCEEDED WITHOUT ANY FRESH INCIDENT BUT ON THE SATURDAY MORNING THE TRAVELLERS FOUND THEMSELVES IN A REGION OF QUITE AN ALTERED CHARACTER INSTEAD OF THE WIDE SMOOTH PLAIN OF ICE THAT HAD HITHERTO STRETCHED BEFORE THEM
WELL THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY THEN IN PRODUCING AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THAT WILL COST NOTHING AND BE FAR BRIGHTER FIRST RATE SAID JOHNSON LET US SET TO WORK AT ONCE BY ALL MEANS
THIS PHENOMENON WAS NONE THE LESS STRANGE FOR BEING EXPLAINED
COULD ONLY MANAGE TO KEEP OFF HIS PURSUERS BY FLINGING DOWN ONE ARTICLE AFTER ANOTHER FIRST HIS CAP THEN HIS HATCHET AND FINALLY HIS GUN
THEY ARE THERE HE EXCLAIMED ALL ASKED BELL THE WHOLE PACK ALTAMONT RUSHED TO THE WINDOWS AND BEGAN TO FILL UP THE DEEP EMBRASURE WITH BLOCKS OF ICE WHICH HE BROKE OFF THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE
HUNTING WAS THE PRINCIPAL OCCUPATION THERE WAS AN ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF FRESH MEAT TO BE HAD THEY SHOT PARTRIDGES PTARMIGANS AND SNOW ORTOLANS WHICH ARE DELICIOUS EATING THE HUNTERS NEVER WENT FAR FROM FORT PROVIDENCE
EVERY MAN HAS HIS OWN FASHION OF DINING REMARKED THE PHILOSOPHICAL AMERICAN HAPPILY SAID THE DOCTOR WELL IF EATING IS SUCH AN IMPERATIVE NECESSITY IN THESE LATITUDES
NOT I SAID ALTAMONT IT RATHER SICKENS ME AND MAKES ME LOATHE THE SIGHT OF A SEAL BUT STOP I DO BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE CHANCE OF A DINNER OFF ONE FOR I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF THAT'S NOT SOMETHING ALIVE LYING ON THOSE LUMPS OF ICE YONDER
AND MUST NOT A SLOOP BUILT BY FOUR ENGLISHMEN AND MANNED BY FOUR ENGLISHMEN BE ENGLISH FROM KEEL TO GUNWALE HATTERAS WAS STILL SILENT NO CONTINUED CLAWBONNY THE REAL TRUTH IS IT IS NOT THE SLOOP YOU CARE ABOUT IT IS THE MAN
AND SLID DOWN THE ROCK WITH HIM INTO THE SNOW HOUSE THE BEARS STOPPED SHORT ON THE UPPER PLATEAU AND HATTERAS AND HIS COMPANIONS LOST NO TIME IN BARRING AND BARRICADING THEM OUT HERE WE ARE AT LAST EXCLAIMED HATTERAS
AND THEIR BARKING WOULD DECEIVE THE MOST PRACTISED EARS EVEN THE CANINE RACE THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY IT INDEED IT SEEMS AS IF THE WILY ANIMALS EMPLOYED THIS RUSE TO ATTRACT THE DOGS AND MAKE THEM THEIR PREY
HER OWN ROOM HOWEVER AFFORDED HER BUT LITTLE RELIEF AND IN PASSING THROUGH THE LONG GALLERY THAT COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE BUILDING SHE NOTICED THE DOOR OF SINGLETON'S ROOM TO BE OPEN THE WOUNDED YOUTH SEEMED SLEEPING AND WAS ALONE
A SECOND SOLDIER WHO WAS STATIONED NEAR THE HOUSE TO PROTECT THE HORSES OF THE OFFICERS COULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE OUTSIDE OF THE APARTMENT AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT WINDOW OR OUTLET OF ANY KIND EXCEPTING ITS DOOR
FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHEN HE MADE HIS MORNING ENTRANCE BUT AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT PRESIDED OVER THE COMFORTS OF THE ENGLISH COLONEL SARAH HAD SHRUNK WITH CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ENTERING THE ROOM YET SHE KNEW THE POSITION OF EVERY GLASS AND HAD WITH HER OWN HANDS SUPPLIED THE CONTENTS OF EVERY BOWL THAT STOOD ON HIS TABLE
AND FEARFUL THE CONVERSATION WOULD CEASE HE INQUIRED WITH AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT INTEREST YOU THINK IT WAS AGE AND DEBILITY THAT REMOVED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AT LAST AND THE TROUBLESOME TIMES TROUBLE IS A HEAVY PULL DOWN TO A SICK BED
FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
HE ANSWERED THE APPLICANT WITH A GOOD NATURED SMILE I JUDGE NOT IF DEATH HAS ANTICIPATED YOUR NUPTIALS I AM FEARFUL YOU HAVE NO REMEDY AGAINST HIS STERN DECREES TO KATY THIS SOUNDED WELL ALTHOUGH SHE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF ITS MEANING BUT DEATH AND NUPTIALS
UNDER MINE ANSWERED KATY WITH AN AIR OF A LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND CARE THROWN AWAY I MAY WELL CALL IT FOR HARVEY IS QUITE TOO DESPISABLE TO BE ANY SORT OF COMPENSATION AT PRESENT THE MUTUAL IGNORANCE OF EACH OTHER'S MEANING MADE VERY LITTLE INTERRUPTION TO THE DIALOGUE
YOU APPEAR TO BE A SENSIBLE DISCREET WOMAN AND SOME WHO HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF ACQUIRING MORE CORRECT VIEWS MIGHT ENVY YOU YOUR RESPECT FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE ALTHOUGH THE HOUSEKEEPER DID NOT ALTOGETHER COMPREHEND THE OTHER'S MEANING SHE KNEW HE USED A COMPLIMENT
HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
FRANCES FELT SHE WAS IMPROPERLY PRYING INTO THE SACRED PRIVACY OF ANOTHER BUT HER EMOTIONS WERE TOO POWERFUL TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK
WERE YOU THE MAN WHOSE PICTURE IS ON THE GOLD I WOULD NOT LISTEN TO SUCH A CRIME
THERE WAS A PLAINTIVE EARNESTNESS IN THE VOICE OF MISS SINGLETON THAT DISARMED FRANCES OF ALL RESENTMENT AND THE ONLY ANSWER SHE COULD MAKE WAS TO HIDE HER BURNING FACE BETWEEN HER HANDS AS SHE SANK BACK IN A CHAIR TO CONCEAL HER CONFUSION
THE DOCTOR HAD WATCHED DURING THE NIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE BED OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE WOUNDED ENGLISHMAN WHO BEING MORE HURT IN THE SPIRIT THAN IN THE FLESH
WITHOUT ALL THE SEASON'S CHILL SYMPTOMS BEGIN BUT THE FIRE OF PASSION IS RAGING WITHIN FRANCES ABANDONED HER WHOLE SOUL TO THE SUPPRESSED MELODY OF THE MUSIC
THERE IS BUT LITTLE DANGER OF EXCEEDING THE TRUTH
DOUBTLESS IT IS HIS DUTY TWAS SAID ABOVE A ROYAL PARTY WAS MOVING ON THE RIVER THOUGH I PASSED THE TROOPS BUT TWO MILES FROM THIS SPOT THE LATTER PART OF THE SENTENCE WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE AND IT WAS SPOKEN MORE IN THE MANNER OF A SOLILOQUY THAN AS IF FOR THE EARS OF HER COMPANIONS
BESIDES WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE DEERSKIN PURSE BUT HARVEY IS LITTLE BETTER NOW THAN A BEGGAR AND A BEGGAR MISS JEANETTE IS THE MOST AWFULLY DESPISABLE OF ALL EARTHLY CREATURES
AND SHE ROSE AND MOVED TO A WINDOW OF HER APARTMENT
I PROMISE YOU ON THE WORD OF AN HONEST DRAGOON TO LEND YOU A HELPING HAND TO SEE THEM RIGHTED
IT WAS A MAXIM WITH DOCTOR SITGREAVES THAT NO SPECIES OF KNOWLEDGE WAS TO BE DESPISED AND CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS AN EMPIRIC IN EVERYTHING BUT HIS PROFESSION AT FIRST INDIGNATION AT THE IRONY OF HIS COMRADE KEPT HIM SILENT BUT SUDDENLY CHANGING HIS PURPOSE
TIS NOTHING REPLIED THE PEDDLER
BUT THEY WERE ALL HAUGHTILY REJECTED BY THE YOUNG MAN AS UNWORTHY OF HIS CHARACTER IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETREAT TO THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE COTTAGE FOR HE WOULD UNAVOIDABLY BE SEEN AND FOLLOWED BY A TROOP OF HORSE AS INEVITABLY TAKEN
COULD INFLICT ON ALL HIS TREASON TO THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY AND AMERICA MORE THAN ONCE HE FELT PROMPTED TO DISTURB THE REPOSE OF THE PEDDLER
AND TENDER HEARTED PITY ARE SEEN REFLECTED AS FROM A MIRROR'S FACE BUT COLD EXPERIENCE CAN VEIL THESE HUES WITH LOOKS INVENTED SHREWDLY TO ENCOMPASS
HAD PLEASANTLY INSISTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF HER NEPHEW SHOULD IN NO MANNER INTERFERE WITH THE REGULAR HOURS SHE HAD ESTABLISHED CONSEQUENTLY THE PARTY WERE ALREADY SEATED WHEN THE CAPTAIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE
WHO ADMINISTERED TO THE CASE NO ONE YET SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH QUICKNESS I EXPECT HE HAS MADE HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT THE SURGEON DISREGARDED THE SMILE OF THE LADIES AND PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES IT IS DOUBTLESS WISE TO BE PREPARED FOR DEATH BUT UNDER WHOSE CARE WAS THE SICK MAN DURING HIS INDISPOSITION
AND THE LATTER ADVANCED PROMPTLY AND LAID HIS FINGERS ON THE PULSE OF THE YOUTH BECKONING TO HIM TO BE SILENT WHILE HE MUTTERED GROWING SYMPTOMS OF A FEBRILE PULSE NO NO MY DEAR GEORGE YOU MUST REMAIN QUIET AND DUMB THOUGH YOUR EYES LOOK BETTER AND YOUR SKIN HAS EVEN A MOISTURE
BUT HE LEAVES HIS ROOM AND THINKS HIS WOUND LIGHTLY PURCHASED BY THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS IF SHE ADDED WITH A TREMULOUS LIP THIS DREADFUL SUSPICION THAT IS AFFIXED TO HIS VISIT WERE REMOVED I COULD CONSIDER HIS WOUND OF LITTLE MOMENT YOU NOW HAVE THE FRUITS OF REBELLION BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
A WARM HEARTED FEMALE CAN MAKE IN LOVE IN THE SHORT SPACE OF HALF AN HOUR PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE IS A PREDISPOSITION TO THE DISTEMPER SARAH FOUND THE CONVERSATION WHEN IT BEGAN TO TOUCH ON FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY TOO INTERESTING TO VENTURE HER VOICE WITH A REPLY
UNTIL THE DRAGOON AT HIS DOOR HEARD HIS LOUD BREATHINGS
HE APPROACHED THE YOUTH WITH AN AIR OF COMIC GRAVITY AND WITH A LOW BOW CONTINUED I AM SORRY FOR THE SEVERE COLD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD SIR I EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN IN SURPRISE
IN SHORT WHARTON SAID THE COLONEL PUTTING ONE LEG OUT OF BED IT MAY BE CALLED A COMBINATION OF UNTOWARD EVENTS YOUR OWN UNGOVERNABLE HORSE PREVENTED MY ORDERS FROM BEING CARRIED TO THE MAJOR IN SEASON TO FLANK THE REBELS VERY TRUE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN KICKING A SLIPPER TOWARDS THE BED
ONE WOULD NOT WISH TO DIE WITH ANY VERY HEAVY SIN ON HIS CONSCIENCE AFTER ALL
AND SHE DREW BACK TO A CHAIR WHERE SHE STILL RETAINED A VIEW OF THE STRANGER FROM WHOSE COUNTENANCE SHE FELT IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHDRAW HER EYES ISABELLA WAS TOO MUCH ENGROSSED BY HER OWN FEELINGS TO DISCOVER THE TREMBLING FIGURE OF THE WITNESS TO HER ACTIONS AND SHE PRESSED
HIS PATIENT SMILED AS HE GENTLY REPULSED HIS PHYSICIAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDO THE BANDAGES AND WITH A RETURNING GLOW TO HIS CHEEKS INQUIRED
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE SAD OFFICE THAT WAS IN UNISON WITH HER FEELINGS AS SHE GAZED AROUND SHE SAW THE TREES BENDING TO THE FORCE OF THE WIND THAT SWEPT THROUGH THE VALLEY WITH AN IMPETUOSITY THAT SHOOK EVEN THE BUILDINGS
AND I FIND IT A GREAT STRENGTHENER IN TIME OF NEED WHILE SPEAKING HE TOOK A BIBLE FROM HIS POCKET AND OFFERED IT TO THE PEDDLER BIRCH RECEIVED THE VOLUME WITH HABITUAL REVERENCE BUT THERE WAS AN ABSTRACTED AIR ABOUT HIM AND A WANDERING OF THE EYE
AND DROVE THE BLOOD FROM THEIR FACES TO THEIR HEARTS WITH A CHILL THAT NEARLY ANNIHILATED FEELING A MAN WHOSE COLOSSAL STATURE MANIFESTED THE POSSESSION OF VAST STRENGTH ENTERED THE ROOM AND REMOVING HIS CAP
TWAS UNFORTUNATE INDEED IN EVERY RESPECT THAT YOU MET WITH THE ACCIDENT OR DOUBTLESS THE ROYAL ARMS WOULD HAVE TRIUMPHED IN THEIR USUAL MANNER AND YET THE PLEASURE OF SUCH SOCIETY AS THIS ACCIDENT HAS INTRODUCED ME TO
TO SEE THAT IT WAS THE FIGURE OF A MAN IN THE WELL KNOWN DRESS OF THE SOUTHERN HORSE BUT SHE GASPED FOR BREATH AND INSTINCTIVELY LAID HER HAND ON HER HEART TO QUELL ITS THROBBINGS AS SHE THOUGHT SHE RECOGNIZED THE LINEAMENTS THAT WERE SO DEEPLY SEATED IN HER OWN IMAGINATION
COULD BE DISTINGUISHED AT A DISTANCE ON THE HEIGHTS BENDING TO THEIR POMMELS AS THEY FACED THE KEEN AIR WHICH HAD SO LATELY TRAVERSED THE GREAT FRESH WATER LAKES AND DRAWING THEIR WATCH COATS ABOUT THEM IN TIGHTER FOLDS
HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS OWN ROOM AND NOTWITHSTANDING CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SMILES OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE
HER EYES WERE UNIFORMLY FASTENED ON THE POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS SUDDENLY LOST BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HILL AND AT EACH TURN AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF THE SPOT SHE LINGERED UNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER SISTER QUICKENED HER PACE TO AN EVEN MOTION WITH THAT OF HER OWN
IF ANYONE INTERFERES WITH MY PATIENTS CRIED THE DOCTOR HASTILY I WILL TEACH THEM SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT WHAT IT IS TO MEDDLE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CONCERNS TUT MY DEAR FELLOW THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE MADE NOR ANY INTENDED SEE EXHIBITING THE BANDAGES
I NEVER WAS A SOLDIER THEREFORE NEVER COULD DESERT SAID THE PEDDLER RESTING HIS FACE ON HIS HAND IN A MELANCHOLY ATTITUDE WHY DESERTION CONSISTS OF MORE THAN QUITTING YOUR COLORS THOUGH THAT IS CERTAINLY THE WORST KIND
IT CONTAINED ONLY THESE WORDS WEDNESDAY ON FRIDAY NIGHT NEXT AT HALF PAST TWELVE THIS HE READ TWICE OR THRICE PAUSING BETWEEN WHILES THE ENVELOPE BORE THE LONDON POSTMARK
ARE YOU ENGAGED MISS BRANDON HE SAID IN LOW EAGER TONES YES TO BOTH QUESTIONS ANSWERED SHE WITH THE FAINTEST GLEAM OF THE CONVENTIONAL SMILE AND LOOKING NOW GRAVELY AGAIN AT HER BOUQUET
AND IN THE SPIRIT OF HISTORY I SUSPECT THE INTEREST WHICH BEAUTY ALWAYS EXCITES HAD A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH MY RESOLVE TO HOLD MY GROUND AND I DARE SAY NOTWITHSTANDING MY OTHER REASONS HAD THE LADIES AT THE HALL BEEN ALL EITHER OLD OR UGLY
THE YOUNG LADY HAD PEREMPTORILY MADE UP HER MIND TO DANCE NO MORE THAT NIGHT HOW CAN DORCAS ENDURE THAT MAN THOUGHT RACHEL
CERTAINLY YOU WOMEN HAVE A MARVELLOUS TALENT FOR MAKING MOUNTAINS OF MOLEHILLS YOU AND RADIE ARE ADEPTS IN THE ART
I CAN'T SAY THAT WYLDER WAS AN OLD FRIEND BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES I HAD WE HAD BEEN FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS AT SCHOOL TOGETHER AND WHEN HIS SHIP CAME TO ENGLAND MET FREQUENTLY
AND THIS SHE NEVER ADMITTED TO HERSELF BEFORE MORE PARTICULAR NO NOT EXACTLY THAT BUT MORE SOMETHING OR OTHER NOT EXACTLY EXPRESSIBLE IN WORDS IN HIS APPROACHES TO HER THAN WAS CONSISTENT WITH HIS SITUATION
ABOUT FOUR DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE DESPATCHES TO WHICH THE CONFERENCE OF CAPTAIN LAKE AND THE ATTORNEY REFERRED THERE CAME A LETTER FROM THE SAME PROLIFIC CORRESPONDENT DATED TWENTIETH MARCH FROM GENOA WHICH ALTOGETHER PUZZLED MISTER LARKIN
BEFORE HE REPLACED IT IN ITS IRON DRAWER IT IS NOT A THING TO BE PASSED OVER MURMURED THE ATTORNEY WHO HAD COME TO A DECISION AS TO THE FIRST STEP TO BE TAKEN AND HE THOUGHT WITH A QUALM OF THE EFFECT OF ONE OF WYLDER'S CONFIDENTIAL NOTES
I SAY SETTLE IT QUIETLY HERE I AM
I BELIEVE I OUGHT TO HAVE WITHDRAWN A LITTLE I SAID VERY HUMBLY AND OLD LADY CHELFORD AT THE WORD SHOT A GLEAM OF CONTEMPTUOUS TRIUMPH AT MISS DORCAS
CAPTAIN LAKE STARTED UP THE INSTINCT
WITH A DREADFUL YEARNING HE HATED THE FRESH GLITTER OF THAT MORNING SCENE WHY SHOULD THE WORLD BE CHEERFUL IT WAS A REPAST SPREAD OF WHICH HE COULD NOT PARTAKE AND IT SPITED HIM
I'M GROWN BROWN AND GREAT WHISKERS I MET POOR DOMINICK WHAT AN ASS THAT CHAP IS BUT HE DID NOT KNOW ME TILL I INTRODUCED MYSELF SO I MUST BE A GOOD DEAL CHANGED OUR SHIP WAS AT MALTA WHEN I GOT THE LETTER I WAS SICK OF THE SERVICE AND NO WONDER A LIEUTENANT
ILLUSION OF MAGIC STANLEY'S UNEASINESS LEST RACHEL'S CONDUCT SHOULD COMPROMISE THEM INCREASED HE GREW MORE NERVOUS ABOUT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN HIM AND MARK WYLDER
COME NOW DORKIE BE A GOOD GIRL YOU MUST NOT LOOK SO VEXED I'M NOT VEXED WHAT THEN I'M ONLY THINKING SHE SAID THIS WITH THE SAME BITTER SMILE
THE YOUNG LADY STILL WAS FANCY FREE NOT A BIT IN LOVE
IN FACT A VERY CONFIDENTIAL ONE ALIKE IN RELATION TO MISTER WYLDER AND TO THE FAMILY OF BRANDON HALL IS OF COURSE SACRED AND ANYTHING THAT COMES FROM YOU MISTER LARCOM IS NEVER HEARD IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR NAME BEYOND THESE WALLS
YES STANLEY I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR YOU PERHAPS FOR MYSELF I HAD DIED LONG AGO WELL THAT IS ANOTHER THING BUT IN THE MEANTIME I ASSURE YOU RACHEL YOU
I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING WRONG IN THIS GYLINGDEN OFFICE DRIVER HAS BEEN ALWAYS CORRECT BUT IT IS HARD TO KNOW ANY MAN FOR CERTAIN IN THIS WORLD I DON'T THINK THE CAPTAIN WOULD VENTURE ANYTHING SO AWFULLY HAZARDOUS I REALLY CAN'T SUSPECT SO MONSTROUS A THING
I HATE THEM SAID THE CAPTAIN I WONDER HOW MY SISTER IS THIS MORNING WOULD YOU LIKE A MESSENGER I'LL SEND DOWN WITH PLEASURE TO ENQUIRE THANK YOU NO I'LL WALK DOWN AND SEE HER AND LAKE YAWNED AT THE WINDOW
THE SHOCK OF HER BRIEF INTERVIEW WITH HER BROTHER OVER REFLECTION ASSURED HER KNOWING ALL SHE DID THAT STANLEY'S WOOING WOULD PROSPER AND SO THIS CAUSE OF QUARREL HAD REALLY NOTHING IN IT
AND OVER HER SHOULDER SHE CRIED TO HER BROTHER TELL HER STANLEY AND SO SHE QUICKLY LEFT THE ROOM AND WAS GONE WELL DORKIE LOVE WHAT'S THE MATTER SAID STANLEY SHARPLY AT LAST BREAKING THE SILENCE
AND HIS GRANDFATHER HE DID NOT CARE TO ENQUIRE AFTER AND WHO HAS HAD THE EDUCATION OF ONE DOES NOT FEEL HIMSELF AT HOME YOU KNOW I'M SURE YOU HAVE FELT THE SAME SORT OF THING YOURSELF OH OF COURSE
SHALL I TAKE YOU TO THE SUPPER ROOM NO STANLEY THANK YOU I PREFER REMAINING HAVE YOU OBSERVED HOW DORCAS HAS TREATED ME THIS EVENING NO STANLEY NOTHING UNUSUAL IS THERE
AND CLACK OF TONGUES THAT FOLLOWED THE CLOSE OF THE GAME CAPTAIN LAKE GLARED ROUND FOR A MOMENT LIKE A MAN CALLED UP FROM SLEEP THE NOISE RATTLED AND ROARED IN HIS EARS THE TALK SOUNDED MADLY AND THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE EXCITED AND MENACED
HAD JUST ENTERTAINED HIS NOBLE PATRONESS AND HIS AUDIENCE EVERYONE HAS EXPERIENCED I SUPPOSE FOR A FEW WONDERFUL MOMENTS NOW AND THEN A GLOW OF SEEMINGLY CAUSELESS HAPPINESS
THE LINES OF HIS PALE FACE CONTRACTED STRANGELY AND HIS WILD GAZE FOLLOWED HIM AND I DON'T THINK HE BREATHED ONCE UNTIL THE THIN SMILING MAN
THAN SHE WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE LITTLE PARLOUR OF REDMAN'S FARM
THE WHITE CURTAINS AND WHITE COVERLET SO LIKE THE DARK CHAMBER OF WHITE DEATH HE HAD INTENDED SPEAKING TO TAMAR THERE BUT CHANGED HIS MIND OR RATHER COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND AND HE LOITERED SILENTLY AND STOOD WITH THE CURTAIN
WOULD BE SURE TO REPORT HER ELEGANT LITTLE COMPLIMENT IN THE PROPER QUARTERS AND THAT HER INCENSE HAD NOT MISSED FIRE
CEREMONIOUS ASCENT TO THE EMPTY CHAMBER CHILDREN HAD ONCE OCCUPIED THAT SILENT FLOOR FOR THERE WAS A LITTLE BALUSTRADED GATE ACROSS THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE
SOME IDLE BOYS WERE OBSERVING THE DANDY CAPTAIN AND HE TURNED DOWN
MISTER LARKIN WALKED DOWN DIRECT TO GYLINGDEN AND PAID A RATHER AWFUL VISIT TO MISTER DRIVER OF THE POST OFFICE A FOREIGN LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIM HAD MOST POSITIVELY BEEN LOST HE HAD CALLED TO MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE LEST MISTER DRIVER SHOULD BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION
THAT ON GREETING MISTER LARKIN IN THE PARLOUR HE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO MENTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN COLD IN THAT CONFOUNDED BILLIARD ROOM LAST NIGHT WHICH SPOILED HIS SLEEP AND MADE HIM AWFULLY SEEDY THAT MORNING OF COURSE HIS HOST WAS PROPERLY AFFLICTED AND SYMPATHETIC
THANK YOU SAID HE TO THE MAID SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING HIMSELF WITH A SORT OF SMILE THAT WILL DO WHAT CONFOUNDED NONSENSE HE'LL BE QUITE COOL AGAIN IN FIVE MINUTES NEVER MIND
I DON'T SEE WHY IT SHOULD BUT I AM VERY CERTAIN SAID RACHEL WHO IN THE MIDST OF THIS CROWDED GOSSIPING BALL ROOM WAS TALKING MUCH MORE FREELY TO STANLEY AND ALSO STRANGE TO SAY IN MORE SISTERLY FASHION
SHE SMILED AND TO OUTWARD SEEMING WAS THE SAME BUT RACHEL FELT THAT THE FASHION OF HER COUNTENANCE TOWARDS HER WAS CHANGED SINCE HER MARRIAGE SHE HAD NOT HINTED TO RACHEL THE SUBJECT OF THEIR OLD CONVERSATIONS
AS HE WALKED DOWN THE MILL ROAD TOWARD THE TOWN HE MET LORD CHELFORD ON HIS WAY TO MAKE ENQUIRY ABOUT RACHEL AT REDMAN'S FARM AND LAKE WHO AS WE KNOW HAD JUST SEEN HIS SISTER GAVE HIM ALL PARTICULARS CHELFORD LIKE THE LAWYER
WHATEVER THOU ART HE LAUGHED VERY PASSIONATE BUT HARDLY RESPECTABLE I ONCE KNEW HE CONTINUED A LITTLE MORE GRAVELY A MARRIAGE MADE UPON THAT PRINCIPLE AND NOT VERY AUDACIOUSLY EITHER
MY EYES WANDERED OVER THEM ALL WITH THAT STRANGE SENSE OF UNREALITY AND THAT MINGLING OF SWEET AND BITTER FANCY WITH WHICH WE REVISIT A SCENE FAMILIAR IN VERY REMOTE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD AND WHICH HAS HAUNTED A LONG INTERVAL OF MATURITY AND ABSENCE
BUT THERE WERE SEVERAL REASONS AGAINST IT SO THAT HANDSOME COIN REMAINED IN HIS PURSE AND I FORGOT TO TELL YOU TAMAR I'VE A RING FOR YOU IN TOWN A LITTLE SOUVENIR YOU'LL THINK IT PRETTY A GOLD RING WITH A STONE IN IT
THEY HAD PRODUCED THEIR MADMEN AND VILLAINS TOO AND THERE HAD BEEN FREQUENT INTERMARRIAGES NOT VERY OFTEN HAPPY
ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A SOLEMN AND GENTLEMANLIKE REVERENCE OH MISTER LARCOM A MESSAGE OR BUSINESS SAID MISTER LARKIN URBANELY NOT A MESSAGE SIR ONLY AN ENQUIRY ABOUT THEM FEW SHARES
HE HAD MADE A BARGAIN AND HE WOULD STICK TO IT AND SO HE LET HER BE THOUGH SORELY AGAINST HIS WILL FOR THE SAME REASON THAT IS BECAUSE HE WOULD STICK TO HIS SIDE OF THE BARGAIN HE DID NOT REQUIRE HER TO SIT UP AT TABLE
ALTHOUGH TO BE SURE THIS LEFT HIM BETTER PLEASED THAN HER
AND THEN HE CHRISTENED THEM FOR THIS PURPOSE HE BROUGHT A LITTLE BOWL OF WATER SPRINKLED THEM AS IF IN BAPTISM AND TOLD THEM HE WAS THEIR GODFATHER AND GAVE EACH OF THEM A NAME CALLING THEM SOREL KASPER SELWYN ESTHER AND ANGELICA
AND THAT IS YOU MUST STAY WITH ME AND NOT GO OUT ALONE FOR THAT IS DANGEROUS IF ANY DOG CAME ON YOU HE WOULD KILL YOU DIRECTLY HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING SHE CAME TO HIM JOYOUSLY BEGAN FAWNING ON HIM AND PRANCING ROUND HIM SO THAT IN SPITE OF HIS VEXATION WITH HER
WHETHER HE HAD A WIFE OR ONLY A WILD VIXEN IN HIS HOUSE BUT YET HE WAS COMFORTED THAT SHE BORE AT ALL WITH HIM THOUGH SO RESTLESSLY THAT HE DID NOT SPARE HER CALLING HER A BAD WILD FOX AND THEN SPEAKING TO HER IN THIS MANNER
AND OPENING HIS EYES FOUND A FULL GROWN FOX WITHIN SIX FEET OF HIM SITTING ON ITS HAUNCHES LIKE A DOG AND WATCHING HIS FACE WITH CURIOSITY MISTER TEBRICK SAW INSTANTLY THAT IT WAS NOT SILVIA WHEN HE MOVED THE FOX GOT UP AND SHIFTED HIS EYES BUT STILL STOOD HIS GROUND
AT LAST HE REFLECTED HOW SHE HAD JUST STRIPPED HERSELF AND HOW IN THE MORNING SHE STRUGGLED AGAINST BEING DRESSED AND HE THOUGHT PERHAPS HE WAS TOO STRICT WITH HER AND IF HE LET HER HAVE HER OWN WAY THEY COULD MANAGE TO BE HAPPY SOMEHOW TOGETHER EVEN IF SHE DID EAT OFF THE FLOOR
WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER SHE LICKED HIS HAND BUT REMAINED SHIVERING FOR A LONG TIME AT HIS FEET AND SHOWED THE CLEAREST SYMPTOMS OF TERROR IF HE SO MUCH AS MOVED TOWARDS THE PIANO ON SEEING THIS AND RECOLLECTING HOW ILL THE EARS OF A DOG CAN BEAR WITH OUR MUSIC
ONE DAY HE TRIED TAKING WITH HIM THE STEREOSCOPE AND A PACK OF CARDS BUT THOUGH HIS SILVIA WAS AFFECTIONATE AND AMIABLE ENOUGH TO LET HIM PUT THE STEREOSCOPE OVER HER MUZZLE YET SHE WOULD NOT LOOK THROUGH IT BUT KEPT TURNING HER HEAD TO LICK HIS HAND
TO ALL HIS REBUKES SHE TURNED A DEAF OR SULLEN EAR AND SO THEY EACH FINISHED THEIR MEAL EATING LITTLE EITHER OF THEM FOR TILL SHE WOULD SIT AT TABLE HE WOULD GIVE HER NO MORE AND HIS VEXATION HAD TAKEN AWAY HIS OWN APPETITE
SHE IS QUITE HAPPY NOW AH INDEED I HAVE HEARD SHE IS NOT LIVING WITH YOU ANY LONGER NO SHE IS NOT LIVING WITH ME SHE IS NOT FAR AWAY I SEE HER EVERY DAY NOW INDEED WHERE DOES SHE LIVE
MOREOVER THE OLD WOMAN'S WORDS THAT IT WAS A SHAME TO LET HER RUN ABOUT LIKE A DOG MOVED HIM EXCEEDINGLY BEING IN THIS MOOD THE TRUTH IS HE WELCOMED HER
HE BEWILDERED SHE ASKING HIM WITH HER EYES AS IF INDEED SHE SPOKE TO HIM WHAT AM I NOW BECOME HAVE PITY ON ME HUSBAND HAVE PITY ON ME FOR I AM YOUR WIFE
SWEET PUSS SOME MEN WOULD PITY ME LIVING ALONE HERE WITH YOU AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED BUT I WOULD NOT CHANGE PLACES WHILE YOU WERE LIVING WITH ANY MAN FOR THE WHOLE WORLD THOUGH YOU ARE A FOX I WOULD RATHER LIVE WITH YOU THAN ANY WOMAN I SWEAR I WOULD
MISTER TEBRICK SAT SILENTLY LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW FOR SOME TIME THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS POCKET BOOK IN IT THERE WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS WIFE TAKEN SOON AFTER THEIR WEDDING NOW HE GAZED AND GAZED UPON THOSE FAMILIAR FEATURES
WHERE HIS WIFE HAD BEEN THE MOMENT BEFORE WAS A SMALL FOX OF A VERY BRIGHT RED IT LOOKED AT HIM VERY BESEECHINGLY ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM A PACE OR TWO
MISTER TEBRICK INSTANTLY FELL IN WITH HER WISH AND AFTER A FEW TRIALS ADJUSTED IT TO HER VISION THUS THEY SPENT THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON TOGETHER VERY HAPPILY LOOKING THROUGH THE COLLECTION OF VIEWS WHICH HE HAD PURCHASED OF ITALY SPAIN AND SCOTLAND
THE FIT IS ON YOU NOW SILVIA TO BE A FOX BUT I SHALL KEEP YOU CLOSE AND IN THE MORNING YOU WILL RECOLLECT YOURSELF AND THANK ME FOR HAVING KEPT YOU NOW SO HE LAY DOWN AGAIN BUT NOT TO SLEEP
THOUGH AT FIRST HE CALLED TO HER TO COME BACK AND WALK ANOTHER WAY MISTER TEBRICK WAS OVERBORNE BY HER PLEASURE AND SAT DOWN
THOUGH IF THIS WAS TRUE IT WAS NEVER SEEN BY ANYONE ELSE EXCEPT HER HUSBAND ON ONE OF THE FIRST DAYS OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN EIGHTY IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON
AND ALL AS HE KNEW BECAUSE THERE WAS A FOX WITHIN DOORS AND THEY WOULD KILL IT HE STARTED UP NOW CALLING TO THE GARDENER THAT HE WOULD COME DOWN TO THE DOGS HIMSELF TO QUIET THEM AND BADE THE MAN GO INDOORS AGAIN AND LEAVE IT TO HIM
HEARING THIS STORY OF MYSELF DIVERTED ME AT THE TIME BUT I FULLY BELIEVE IT HAS SERVED ME IN GOOD STEAD SINCE FOR IT SET ME ON MY GUARD AS PERHAPS NOTHING ELSE WOULD HAVE DONE AGAINST ACCEPTING FOR TRUE ALL FLOATING RUMOUR AND VILLAGE GOSSIP
IT WAS THIRTY MILES AWAY FROM STOKOE WHICH IN THE COUNTRY MEANS AS FAR AS TIMBUCTOO DOES TO US IN LONDON THEN IT WAS NEAR TANGLEY AND HIS LADY HAVING KNOWN IT FROM HER CHILDHOOD WOULD FEEL AT HOME THERE AND ALSO IT WAS UTTERLY REMOTE
MISTER TEBRICK GOING DOWNSTAIRS PITCHED UPON THE PARLOUR MAID JANET SAYS HE MISSUS TEBRICK AND I HAVE HAD SOME BAD NEWS AND MISSUS TEBRICK WAS CALLED AWAY INSTANTLY TO LONDON AND LEFT THIS AFTERNOON
AND NO KIND OF AGONY COULD BE GREATER TO HIM THAN TO SEE HER THUS FORGET HERSELF ON THIS ACCOUNT IT MAY INDEED BE REGRETTED THAT MISSUS TEBRICK HAD BEEN SO EXACTLY WELL BRED AND IN PARTICULAR THAT HER TABLE MANNERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN SCRUPULOUS
BUT NOT WITHOUT DEFIANCE TOO AND IT SEEMED TO MISTER TEBRICK AS IF THERE WAS ALSO A TOUCH OF CYNICAL HUMOUR IN HIS LOOK AS IF HE SAID BY GAD WE TWO HAVE BEEN STRANGELY BROUGHT TOGETHER AND TO THE MAN AT ANY RATE IT SEEMED STRANGE THAT THEY WERE THUS LINKED
AND THAT HER OLD NURSE COULD NEVER BE SATISFIED WITH HER NOW WHATEVER SHE DID BUT WOULD ALWAYS THINK HER WICKED TO BE A FOX AT ALL THERE SEEMS GOOD REASON FOR HER DISLIKE AND IT IS POSSIBLE TOO THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN ANOTHER CAUSE AS WELL AND THAT IS JEALOUSY
HE WAS SORRY ENOUGH NOW THAT MISSUS CORK HAD DISAPPOINTED HIM IN THE HOPES HE HAD HAD OF HER TO HAVE THE OLD WOMAN AS IT WERE ON HIS HANDS TRUE SHE COULD BE USEFUL ENOUGH IN MANY WAYS TO HIM BY DOING THE HOUSEWORK THE COOKING AND MENDING
FOR WE MAY TRUST DOGS WHO ARE FAMILIARS WITH ALL THE HOUSEHOLD PETS NAY MORE WE CAN PUT THEM UPON TRUST WITH ANYTHING AND KNOW THEY WILL NOT TOUCH IT NOT EVEN IF THEY BE STARVING BUT THINGS WERE COME TO SUCH A PASS WITH HIS VIXEN THAT HE DARED NOT IN HIS HEART TRUST HER AT ALL
HE SPOKE TO HER BUT SHE SEEMED DISPLEASED SO HE LAID CLARISSA HARLOWE ASIDE NOR DID HE EVER REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT OF READING TO HER
SMELT THEM STOOD A LITTLE WAY OFF LOOKING AT THEM THEN THANKED HIM AGAIN MISTER TEBRICK AND THIS WAS ALL PART OF HIS PLAN THEN TOOK A VASE AND WENT TO FIND SOME WATER FOR THEM BUT LEFT THE FLOWERS BESIDE HER
THE PARLOUR MAID AND AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN HIS WIFE'S NURSE BESIDES THESE WOMEN THERE WAS A GROOM OR A GARDENER WHICHEVER YOU CHOOSE TO CALL HIM WHO WAS A SINGLE MAN AND SO LIVED OUT LODGING WITH A LABOURING FAMILY ABOUT HALF A MILE AWAY
THE FIRST SNOWDROPS AT THIS SHE RAN UP VERY PRETTILY AND NEVER GIVING AS MUCH AS ONE GLANCE AT THE RABBIT WHICH HAD HOPPED OUT OF ITS BASKET SHE BEGAN TO THANK HIM FOR THE FLOWERS INDEED SHE SEEMED INDEFATIGABLE IN SHEWING HER GRATITUDE
THE MATERIALISM OF OUR AGE WILL NOT HELP US HERE IT IS INDEED A MIRACLE SOMETHING FROM OUTSIDE OUR WORLD ALTOGETHER
BUT TO ALL THAT HE SAID SHE PAID NO HEED WHATEVER BUT ONLY SCRATCHED THE HARDER THUS HE LET HER CONTINUE UNTIL LUNCHEON WHEN SHE WOULD NOT SIT UP OR EAT OFF A PLATE BUT FIRST WAS FOR GETTING ON TO THE TABLE AND WHEN THAT WAS PREVENTED SNATCHED HER MEAT AND ATE IT UNDER THE TABLE
THEY WERE STILL AT THIS TIME LIKE LOVERS IN THEIR BEHAVIOUR AND WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER WHILE THEY WERE WALKING THEY HEARD THE HOUNDS AND LATER THE HUNTSMAN'S HORN IN THE DISTANCE MISTER TEBRICK HAD PERSUADED HER TO HUNT ON BOXING DAY
AND THAT HE HAD FOUND COMPLETE HAPPINESS NOW LIVING FROM DAY TO DAY CARELESS OF THE FUTURE SURROUNDED EVERY MORNING BY PLAYFUL AND AFFECTIONATE LITTLE CREATURES WHOM HE LOVED TENDERLY AND SITTING BESIDE THEIR MOTHER WHOSE SIMPLE HAPPINESS WAS THE SOURCE OF HIS OWN TRUE HAPPINESS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
PRESENTLY HE IMAGINES TO HIMSELF THAT SHE MUST WANT SOMETHING AND SO FETCHES HER FOOD AND WATER BUT SHE NEVER SO MUCH AS LOOKS AT IT BUT STILL GOES ON HER ROUNDS EVERY NOW AND THEN SCRATCHING AT THE DOOR
AND SUCH INCIDENTS WERE PLENTIFUL EVER STOOD A CHANCE OF BEING SMILED AT BY HIM SO IN THIS CASE TOO FOR REALISING THAT THE SILLY DUCKS THOUGHT HIS WIFE A FOX INDEED AND WERE ALARMED ON THAT ACCOUNT
THAT NIGHT SHE WOULD NOT SLEEP WITH HIM NEITHER IN THE BED NOR ON IT
THEN HE FELL INTO EARNEST PRAYER AND CONTINUED SO FOR HALF AN HOUR UPON HIS KNEES THEN HE GOT UP AND DRESSED BUT CONTINUED VERY MELANCHOLY FOR THE WHOLE OF THE MORNING BEING IN THIS MOOD YOU MAY IMAGINE IT HURT HIM TO SEE HIS WIFE RUNNING ABOUT NAKED
YET THAT SAME EVENING AS HE HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING THROUGH HIS WRITING TABLE DRAWER WITH PUSS BESIDE HIM LOOKING OVER HIS ELBOW SHE SPIED A PACK OF CARDS AND THEN HE WAS FORCED TO PICK THEM OUT TO PLEASE HER THEN DRAW THEM FROM THEIR CASE
AND THEN HE TROTTED OFF AS LIGHTLY AS A GOSSAMER VEIL BLOWN IN THE WIND AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO MORE BACK HE COMES WITH HIS VIXEN AND THE CUBS ALL AROUND HIM SEEING THE DOG FOX THUS SURROUNDED BY VIXEN AND CUBS WAS TOO MUCH FOR MISTER TEBRICK
THOUGH SHE WAS NOT EXPECTING TO FIND HER MISTRESS THERE HAVING BEEN TOLD THAT SHE WAS GONE THAT AFTERNOON TO LONDON KNEW HER INSTANTLY AND CRIED OUT OH MY POOR PRECIOUS OH POOR MISS SILVIA
DARED TO STRIKE MY SON WITH HIS OPEN HAND TO KICK HIM TO TEAR HAIRS FROM HIS MOUSTACHE TO USE HIM THUS AND THUS AND THUS
FOR THE VOICE WAS A LOUD AND RASPING ONE A YOUNG MAN STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE A STOCKY BULL NECKED YOUNG MINER IN TWEED SUNDAY CLOTHES AND AN AGGRESSIVE NECK TIE HE WAS A SINISTER LOOKING FIGURE WITH DARK INSOLENT EYES
BUT OUTSIDE THAT CIRCLE THINGS WERE VAGUE AND SHADOWY IN THE OLD DINING HALL TWO SIDES WERE OAK PANELLED AND TWO WERE HUNG WITH FADED TAPESTRY ACROSS WHICH HUNTSMEN AND DOGS AND STAGS WERE STILL DIMLY STREAMING
WHOM THEY WAYLAID IN A WOOD HIDING BY DAY AND TRAVELLING BY NIGHT THEY HAD GOT AS FAR INTO FRANCE AS REMILLY AND WERE WITHIN A MILE A SINGLE MILE CAPTAIN
GOOD LAD HE'LL DO YET CRIED PURVIS GENTLEMEN SAID MONTGOMERY I THINK THAT YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE BOON VERY PATIENT WITH YOU
IN THE COUNTRY YES SIR YOU ARE VERY WISE YOU WILL FIND A QUIET DAY AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS A VERY VALUABLE RESTORATIVE HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION I AM GOING OVER CROXLEY WAY
BUT YOU'VE QUEERED OUR MAN AND HE CAN'T FACE SUCH A BATTLE WITH A TWO INCH CUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE SIR
WILL TAKE WITHOUT FLINCHING A BLOW WHICH WOULD LEAVE ANOTHER MAN WRITHING ON THE GROUND SUCH THINGS ARE NOT TO BE ACQUIRED IN A WEEK BUT ALL THAT COULD BE DONE IN A WEEK SHOULD BE DONE THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT HAD A GOOD BASIS TO START FROM
AND THE RULE OF HIS LIFE WAS NEVER BY WORD OR ACTION TO RUN A RISK OF OFFENDING THE SENTIMENT WHICH HAD MADE HIM HIS STANDARD OF RESPECTABILITY AND OF DIGNITY WAS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AND HE EXPECTED THE SAME FROM HIS ASSISTANTS
HEAVY WITH HIS REPAST LAY BACK IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING UP AT THEM THROUGH THE CLOUDS OF HIS TOBACCO SMOKE AND PONDERING OVER THE STRANGE CHANCE
THESE CAUSELESS WHIMS AND FANCIES ARE VERY MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED MISTER MONTGOMERY CONSIDER HOW MANY THERE ARE TO WHOM THESE VERY POTATOES AND THIS VERY BEER WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE NO DOUBT SIR BUT AT PRESENT I PREFER TO DO WITHOUT THEM
THE CHATEAU NOIR IS NOT MORE THAN FOUR LEAGUES HE SAID THREE AND A KILOMETRE COLONEL YOU KNOW THE PLACE I USED TO WORK THERE
LOOSENED HIS COLLAR AND SQUEEZED THE SURGERY SPONGE OVER HIS FACE HE SAT UP AT LAST WITH A GASP AND A SCOWL DOMN THEE THOU'S SPOILT MY NECK TIE SAID HE MOPPING UP THE WATER FROM HIS BREAST
IT WOULD BE A VERY SPORTING THING OF YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY IF YOU WOULD COME TO OUR HELP WHEN WE ARE IN SUCH A HOLE OF COURSE YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE TO TAKE THE HUNDRED POUNDS BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IN THE CASE OF YOUR WINNING WE COULD ARRANGE THAT IT SHOULD TAKE THE FORM OF A WATCH OR PIECE OF PLATE
EUSTACE WAS TAKEN UPON THE FIFTH TO A VILLAGE CALLED LAUTERBURG WHERE HE MET WITH KINDNESS FROM THE GERMAN OFFICER IN COMMAND THIS GOOD COLONEL HAD THE HUNGRY LAD TO SUPPER
IT WAS LONG HOWEVER BEFORE CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF UPON THE POINT IT WAS A DIFFICULT HOUSE TO SEARCH THIN STAIRS WHICH ONLY ONE MAN COULD ASCEND AT A TIME CONNECTED LINES OF TORTUOUS CORRIDORS
OFFERED HIM THE BEST HE HAD OPENED A BOTTLE OF GOOD WINE AS I HAVE TRIED TO DO FOR YOU AND GAVE HIM A CIGAR FROM HIS OWN CASE
WHAT I TELL YOU IS THE TRUTH AND I AM NOT AFRAID THAT YOU SHOULD TEST IT THE COUNT OF CHATEAU NOIR IS A HARD MAN EVEN AT THE BEST TIME HE WAS A HARD MAN BUT OF LATE HE HAS BEEN TERRIBLE IT WAS HIS SON'S DEATH YOU KNOW
BETWEEN THE AMATEUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL THE COOLNESS THE POWER OF HITTING ABOVE ALL THE CAPABILITY OF TAKING PUNISHMENT COUNT FOR SO MUCH THOSE SPECIALLY DEVELOPED GUTTA PERCHA LIKE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES OF THE HARDENED PUGILIST
THE UNFORTUNATE SOLDIER WAS DRAGGED FROM HIS CHAIR TO WHERE A NOOSED ROPE HAD BEEN FLUNG OVER ONE OF THE HUGE OAKEN RAFTERS WHICH SPANNED THE ROOM
COULD GIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND A BEATING TO MOST STRIPLINGS HE COULD NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON HIS ADVANTAGE IN AGE BUT THEN THERE WAS THE LAMENESS THAT MUST SURELY COUNT FOR A GREAT DEAL AND LASTLY THERE WAS THE CHANCE THAT THE MASTER MIGHT UNDERRATE HIS OPPONENT
HE RUSHED FROM THE ROOM WITH HIS PAPER STILL CRUMPLED UP IN HIS HAND AN INSTANT LATER WITH A GROANING OF OLD LOCKS AND A RASPING OF BARS THE LOW DOOR SWUNG OPEN AND THE PRUSSIANS POURED INTO THE STONE FLAGGED PASSAGE
THEN THE COLONEL WOULD GO FORTH IN HIS WRATH AND FARMSTEADINGS WOULD BLAZE AND VILLAGES TREMBLE BUT NEXT MORNING THERE WAS STILL THAT SAME DISMAL TALE TO BE TOLD DO WHAT HE MIGHT HE COULD NOT SHAKE OFF HIS INVISIBLE ENEMIES
I HEAR THEY'VE HAD A RARE JOB TO GET HIM TO DROP HIS BEER AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT GREAT RED HEADED WENCH OF HIS
HIS ARMS WERE FOLDED ACROSS HIS ARCHING CHEST AND HIS MOUTH WAS SET IN A FIXED SMILE PRAY DO NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF TO LOOK FOR YOUR WEAPONS HE SAID AS THE PRUSSIAN CAST A SWIFT GLANCE AT THE EMPTY CHAIR IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN LAID
YOU HAVE BEEN IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO A LITTLE INDISCREET TO MAKE YOURSELF SO MUCH AT HOME IN A HOUSE EVERY WALL OF WHICH IS HONEYCOMBED WITH SECRET PASSAGES
HE KEPT POKING HIS FINGER INTO MONTGOMERY AS IF HE WERE ONE OF HIS HORSES I HEAR THAT THE MASTER WILL SCALE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ODD AT THE RING SIDE BUT THERE'S SOME OF THAT WHICH HE'D LIKE WELL TO PULL OFF AND LEAVE BEHIND WI HIS SHIRT SAID PURVIS
BLACK AND BITTER WERE THE THOUGHTS OF FRENCHMEN WHEN THEY SAW THIS WEAL OF DISHONOUR SLASHED ACROSS THE FAIR FACE OF THEIR COUNTRY THEY HAD FOUGHT AND THEY HAD BEEN OVERBORNE
LOOK HERE SAID HE TURNING ROUND TO THE MINER YOUR MEDICINE WILL BE MADE UP IN ITS TURN AND SENT DOWN TO YOU I DON'T ALLOW FOLK IN THE SURGERY WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE WAITING ROOM IF YOU WISH TO WAIT AT ALL YOONG MAN SAID THE MINER
MEANWHILE IF HIS OPPONENT WERE THE BEST MAN WHO EVER JUMPED THE ROPES INTO A RING HIS OWN DUTY WAS CLEAR HE MUST PREPARE HIMSELF CAREFULLY THROW AWAY NO CHANCE AND DO THE VERY BEST THAT HE COULD BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH EXISTS IN BOXING AS IN EVERY SPORT
HE HAD LEARNED THE ART OF QUARTERING HIMSELF UPON THE ENEMY WHILE THE BUTLER BROUGHT HIS SUPPER HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF IN MAKING HIS PREPARATIONS FOR A COMFORTABLE NIGHT
THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT ME INTO THE PAINFUL POSITION OF HAVING TO REFUSE YOU HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND WALKED WITH OFFENDED DIGNITY OUT OF THE SURGERY THE STUDENT SMILED BITTERLY AND TURNED TO HIS WORK OF MAKING UP THE MORNING PRESCRIPTIONS
A VERY INTERESTING RELIC OF THE EARLY NORMAN ERA BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE OBJECTION WHICH I SEE TO YOUR GOING TO CROXLEY ON SATURDAY IT IS UPON THAT DATE AS I AM INFORMED THAT THAT RUFFIANLY GLOVE FIGHT TAKES PLACE
AND THE JAW AND THROAT OF A BULLDOG LOOK Y'ERE SAID HE AGAIN WHY HAST THOU NOT SENT T MEDICINE OOP AS THY MASTER ORDERED MONTGOMERY HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE BRUTAL FRANKNESS OF THE NORTHERN WORKER AT FIRST IT HAD ENRAGED HIM
THEY KNEW WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND WHY AND THE THOUGHT UPHELD THEM FOR THEY WERE BITTER AT THE LOSS OF THEIR COMRADES IT WAS A CAVALRY JOB THEY KNEW
THE PROVOCATION WAS SO GROSS THE INSULT SO UNPROVOKED THAT HE COULD HAVE NONE OF THOSE QUALMS WHICH TAKE THE EDGE OFF A MAN'S METTLE HE FINISHED SEALING THE BOTTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS OCCUPIED AND HE ADDRESSED IT AND PLACED IT CAREFULLY IN THE RACK
THOU'LL RISE IN ONE DAY FROM BEING JUST A COMMON DOCTOR TO THE BEST KNOWN MON TWIXT HERE AND BRADFORD THOU ART A WITHERIN TYKE THOU ART AND NO MISTAKE AND IF THOU BEAT THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL THE BEER THOU WANT FOR THE REST OF THY LIFE WAITING FOR THEE AT THE FOUR SACKS
THE WALL IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN THE OPENING HAD CRUMBLED AWAY BUT THE GREAT GATE STILL TOWERED ABOVE THE BRAMBLES AND WEEDS WHICH HAD OVERGROWN ITS BASE
HE TILTED HIS CHAIR BACK AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM HE SAT WITHIN A SMALL CIRCLE OF BRILLIANT LIGHT WHICH GLEAMED UPON HIS SILVER SHOULDER STRAPS AND THREW OUT HIS TERRA COTTA FACE HIS HEAVY EYEBROWS AND HIS YELLOW MOUSTACHE
BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SAID THE PROVINCIAL BIOGRAPHER SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY IS NOW IN HIS FORTIETH YEAR HANG IT I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE
IT WAS A SMALL ROOM INTO WHICH THEY LOOKED VERY MEANLY FURNISHED AN ELDERLY MAN IN THE DRESS OF A MENIAL WAS READING A TATTERED PAPER BY THE LIGHT OF A GUTTERING CANDLE
FOR WE WANT HIM TO FAIR BRAY HIM OH YOU WANT THE MASTER FAIR BRAYED DO YOU SO DO WE WELL WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY IS THIS YOUR MON SIR WELL SUPPOSE IT IS THEN IT'S HIM I WANT TO TELL ABOOT IT
IF THE LIVER BECOMES INVOLVED WE SHALL VERY SOON HAVE THE JAUNDICED EYE AND THE YELLOW SKIN DIARRHOEA IS ANOTHER VERY COMMON COMPLICATION WE HAVE FREQUENT PURGING AND MAYBE SICKNESS AND VOMITING
WHEN HE WAS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE BOARHOUND OR THE GERMAN MASTIFF
WHO WAS A MOST SYMMETRICAL TERRIER AND PROBABLY THE NEAREST APPROACH TO PERFECTION IN THE BREED YET SEEN
AND ON THE LAWNS OF THE BOTANICAL GARDENS AND THE EXAMPLE SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IN ANOTHER DECADE OR SO THE NEGLECTED SEALYHAM TERRIER THE IGNORED TERRIER OF THE BORDERS AND THE ALMOST FORGOTTEN JACK RUSSELL STRAIN
WHEN ABOUT A FORTNIGHT OLD HOWEVER THEY GENERALLY DEVELOP A DARK RIDGE ON THE BELLY AND THE SPOTS WILL THEN BEGIN TO SHOW THEMSELVES FIRST ABOUT THE NECK AND EARS AND AFTERWARDS ALONG THE BACK
SIZE FROM FIFTEEN POUNDS TO TWENTY POUNDS THE BEST WEIGHT BEING AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE EIGHTEEN POUNDS FOR DOGS AND SIXTEEN POUNDS FOR BITCHES WHEN IN CONDITION FOR WORK COLOUR STEEL OR IRON GREY BLACK BRINDLE BROWN BRINDLE
HIS EXCELLENCE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ROAST MUTTON THOUGH IN HIS OWN COUNTRY HE IS REGARDED AS PLEBEIAN JUST A COMMON CUR HE IS BY NO MEANS A MONGREL THAT HE IS OF ANCIENT LINEAGE
BUT THE UNDOUBTED ANTIQUITY OF THIS DOG IS PROVED BY THE FACT THAT REPRESENTATIVES OF A BREED SUFFICIENTLY SIMILAR TO BE CONSIDERED HIS ANCESTORS ARE FOUND ON SOME OF THE OLDEST EGYPTIAN MONUMENTS
BIT OF FASHION MISS GLENDINE HERSCHEL THOUGHTLESS BEAUTY AND FABULOUS FORTUNE ARE PROBABLY SOME OF THE BEST GREYHOUNDS THAT EVER RAN BESIDES THOSE ALREADY ALLUDED TO BIT OF FASHION WAS THE
OR AT THE LEAST THROUGH COCENED FEARE DRIVE THEM OUT OF THEIRE HOLLOW HARBOURS IN SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE COMPELLED TO PREPARE SPEEDIE FLYTE
FREQUENT CHANGE OF KENNEL STRAW AND PERFECT CLEANLINESS FOUR THE PREDISPOSING CAUSES WHICH HAVE COME MORE IMMEDIATELY UNDER MY NOTICE ARE DEBILITY COLD DAMP STARVATION FILTHY KENNELS
THE TRUTH OF IT WAS THAT THE CAPACITY TO CONCENTRATE THE WHOLE ATTENTION ON THE OBJECT FOUND WAS SO INTENSE AS TO HAVE LESSENED EVERY OTHER PROPENSITY THE RUSH OF THE FOXHOUND HAD BEEN ABSORBED BY THE ADDITIONAL FORCE OF THE POINTER CHARACTER
AFTER THE MANNER AND CUSTOME OF FERRETS IN SEARCHING FOR CONNYES CREEP INTO THE GROUNDE
AND MODERATELY WELL DEFINED AT THE TEMPLES
THE OLD WORKING TERRIER THERE CAN HARDLY HAVE BEEN A TIME SINCE THE PERIOD OF THE NORMAN CONQUEST WHEN THE SMALL EARTH DOGS WHICH WE NOW CALL TERRIERS WERE NOT KNOWN IN THESE ISLANDS AND USED BY SPORTING MEN AS ASSISTANTS IN THE CHASE
THEY WERE PRODUCED VERY REGULARLY TOO IN A MARVELLOUS TYPE OF PERFECTION MISTER WILLIAM ARKWRIGHT OF SUTTON SCARSDALE DERBYSHIRE HAS PROBABLY THE BEST KENNEL IN ENGLAND AT THE PRESENT TIME
A WILD FARM IN THE TEVIOTDALE MOUNTAINS
THE BODY COLOUR COMING WELL DOWN THE SHOULDER AND HIPS GRADUALLY MERGING INTO THE LEG COLOUR THE MUSTARDS VARY FROM A REDDISH BROWN TO A PALE FAWN THE HEAD BEING A CREAMY WHITE THE LEGS AND FEET OF A SHADE DARKER THAN THE HEAD
AND THE SIXTEEN DOGS RUN OUT IN THE SECOND ROUND FOR THE WATERLOO PLATE
UNWHOLESOME FOOD IMPURE AIR AND GRIEF THE AGE AT WHICH DOGS TAKE DISTEMPER THEY MAY TAKE DISTEMPER AT ANY AGE THE MOST COMMON TIME OF LIFE IS FROM THE FIFTH TILL THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH MONTH
BLACK MASKS AND SPECTACLES ROUND THE EYES WITH LINES TO THE EARS ARE DESIRABLE LEGS SHORT FORE LEGS HEAVY
BUT HAVING NO FEATHER OR DEW CLAWS THE WHOLE CLAWS SHOULD BE DARK BUT THE CLAWS OF ALL VARY IN SHADE ACCORDING TO THE COLOUR OF THE DOG'S BODY COAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT
AND ALSO THE AFORESAID TARTAN AND SPLINTER TWO THAT NEARLY ALL OF THE BEST PRESENT DAY PEDIGREES GO BACK THIS BEING SO IT IS UNNECESSARY TO GIVE MANY MORE NAMES OF DOGS WHO HAVE IN THEIR GENERATIONS OF SOME YEARS BACK ASSISTED IN BRINGING THE BREED TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION
A GREAT FEATURE IN THE POINTER IS HIS HIND QUARTERS HE CANNOT WELL BE TOO LONG IN THE HAUNCH OR STRONG IN THE STIFLE WHICH SHOULD BE WELL BENT AND THE MUSCLES IN THE SECOND THIGH OF A GOOD POINTER ARE ALWAYS REMARKABLE
BLACK IN BLACK MARKED DOGS
THESE INCLUDED O'LEARY THE PROPERTY OF MISTER CRISP OF PLAYFORD HALL O'LEARY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF THE BEST DOGS OF THE PRESENT DAY AND WAS THE SIRE OF MISSUS
WILL GENERALLY ARREST THE VOMITING IF CONSTIPATION BE PRESENT WE MUST USE NO ROUGH REMEDIES TO GET RID OF IT A LITTLE RAW MEAT CUT INTO SMALL PIECES MINCED IN FACT OR A SMALL PORTION OF RAW LIVER MAY BE GIVEN IF THERE BE LITTLE FEVER
IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT OF ALL THE TERRIER TRIBE THE SCOTTIE TAKEN AS A WHOLE IS THE BEST COMPANION HE MAKES A MOST EXCELLENT HOUSE DOG IS NOT TOO BIG DOES NOT LEAVE WHITE HAIRS ABOUT ALL OVER THE PLACE LOVES ONLY HIS MASTER AND HIS MASTER'S HOUSEHOLD
SIR WALTER SCOTT HIMSELF INFORMS US THAT HE DID NOT DRAW THE CHARACTER OF DANDIE DINMONT FROM ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL IN PARTICULAR BUT THAT THE CHARACTER WOULD WELL FIT A DOZEN OR MORE OF THE LIDDERDALE YEOMEN OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE
IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE AT THAT PERIOD THEY WERE LOOKED UPON AS A NOVELTY
NOR SO PENDULOUS IN LIP AS A POINTER THERE SHOULD BE NO COARSENESS OR COMMON LOOK ABOUT THE SKULL A FAULT WHICH IS MUCH TOO PREVALENT
AS THOSE STILL IN MIDDLE LIFE HAVE SEEN ITS EXTRAORDINARY MERIT WHENEVER BRED IN THE RIGHT WAY AS TO THE ESSENTIAL POINTS OF THE BREED THEY MAY BE SET DOWN AS FOLLOWS HEAD SHOULD BE WIDE FROM EAR TO EAR
TO TEN YEARS IT IS OFTEN SYMPTOMATIC OF OTHER AILMENTS CAUSES VERY NUMEROUS IN WEAKLY DOGS EXPOSURE ALONE WILL PRODUCE IT THE WEATHER TOO HAS NO DOUBT MUCH TO DO WITH THE PRODUCTION OF DIARRHOEA
AS BEING ONE OF THE FOUR THINGS WHICH GO WELL AND ARE COMELY IN GOING A LION WHICH IS STRONGEST AMONG BEASTS AND TURNETH NOT AWAY FROM ANY A GREYHOUND AN HE GOAT ALSO AND A KING AGAINST WHOM THERE IS NO RISING UP
BY A SYSTEM OF ARTIFICIAL BREEDING TO SHOW POINTS FEW OF THESE OLD UNREGISTERED BREEDS WOULD ATTRACT THE EYE OF THE FANCIER ACCUSTOMED TO JUDGE A DOG PARADING BEFORE HIM IN THE SHOW RING TO KNOW THEIR VALUE AND TO APPRECIATE THEIR STERLING GOOD QUALITIES
BANG OR GARNET WERE LIKE HOUSEHOLD WORDS PEOPLE TALKED OF THE GREAT POINTERS THEY WERE SPOKEN OF IN CLUB CHAT OR GOSSIP WRITTEN ABOUT AND THE PROSPECTS OF THE MOORS WERE MUCH ASSOCIATED WITH THE UP TO DATE CHARACTERS OF THE POINTERS AND SETTERS
SINGULARLY ENOUGH TOO THE MOST ESTEEMED BREEDS IN MANY COUNTRIES CAN BE TRACED FROM THE SAME SOURCE SUCH AS THE RUSSIAN POINTER THE GERMAN POINTER THE FRENCH DOUBLE NOSED GRIFFON AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT STILL THE ENGLISH POINTER
COLOUR IN THE WHIPPET IS ABSOLUTELY OF NO IMPORTANCE TO A GOOD JUDGE THOUGH POSSIBLY WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE PEACH FAWN IS THE FAVOURITE AMONG AMATEUR FANCIERS RED FAWNS BLUE OR SLATE COLOURED BLACK BRINDLED OF VARIOUS SHADES
WHEREAS THEY WERE IN REALITY MERELY A PICKED SORT OF OLD SCOTCH OR HIGHLAND TERRIER SIR PAYNTON HIMSELF AS APPEARS FROM THE COLUMNS OF THE LIVE STOCK JOURNAL MARCH SECOND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN BOUGHT SOME OF THE STRAIN OF VAN BUST
IT MAY BE INTERESTING TO GIVE A FEW PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE TRACEABLE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN DANDIE IN MISTER CHARLES COOK'S BOOK ON THIS BREED WE ARE GIVEN PARTICULARS OF ONE WILLIAM ALLAN OF HOLYSTONE BORN IN SEVENTEEN O FOUR
AND IT IS WITHIN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT THE KENNEL CLUB HAS PLACED THE BREED ON ITS RECOGNISED LIST THE FOLLOWING IS THE STANDARD OF POINTS ADOPTED BY THE WHIPPET CLUB HEAD LONG AND LEAN
A CASE IS QUOTED OF THE LATE LORD ANTRIM WHO IN THE EARLY DAYS OF DOG SHOWS EXHIBITED TWO ANIMALS FROM THE SAME LITTER AND WITH THE ONE OBTAINED A PRIZE OR HONOURABLE MENTION IN THE DANDIE CLASSES AND WITH THE OTHER A LIKE DISTINCTION IN THE BEDLINGTON CLASSES
MEANS SO MANY YARDS AND THE AVERAGE SPEED WORKING OUT AT ABOUT SIXTEEN YARDS PER SECOND NEARLY TWICE AS FAST AS THE FASTEST PEDESTRIAN SPRINTER AND ALTOGETHER BEYOND THE POWER OF THE FLEETEST RACE HORSE
WHEN THE WEATHER IS COLD AND WET MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE OPINION BUT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ROAM ABOUT A HOUSE THE WHIPPET WILL FIND A COMFORTABLE PLACE AND WILL RARELY AIL ANYTHING IN SCORES OF HOUSES WHIPPETS GO TO BED WITH THE CHILDREN
EARS PENDULOUS SET WELL BACK WIDE APART AND LOW ON THE SKULL HANGING CLOSE TO THE CHEEK WITH A VERY SLIGHT PROJECTION AT THE BASE BROAD AT THE JUNCTION OF THE HEAD AND TAPERING ALMOST TO A POINT
USUALLY HEARD ONLY FROM THE LIPS OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM MISTER W L MC CANDLISH ONE OF THE GREATEST LIVING AUTHORITIES ON THE BREED
INDEED MY GOOD FAIRY SAID THE MERCHANT ALOUD I AM VASTLY OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR KIND CARE OF ME HE THEN MADE A HEARTY BREAKFAST TOOK HIS HAT AND WAS GOING TO THE STABLE TO PAY HIS HORSE A VISIT
NOT TO SAY KINGS AND QUEENS AND THE MOST OBJECTIONABLE FORM DUPLICITY CAN ASSUME IS THAT OF PUNNING THERE SAID THE QUEEN I NEVER MADE A JEST BUT I BROKE IT IN THE MAKING I AM THE MOST
SHORTLY AFTER HER DEPARTURE ALADDIN MOUNTING HIS HORSE AND ATTENDED BY HIS RETINUE OF MAGNIFICENT ATTENDANTS LEFT HIS PATERNAL HOME FOREVER AND WENT TO THE PALACE IN THE SAME POMP AS ON THE DAY BEFORE NOR DID HE FORGET TO TAKE WITH HIM THE WONDERFUL LAMP
THE PARSON CALLED OUT TO THEM AND BEGGED THEM TO COME AND RELEASE HIM AND THE CLERK HARDLY HAD THEY TOUCHED THE CLERK WHEN THEY ALSO STUCK FAST AS THE OTHERS AND THE SIMPLETON WITH HIS GOLDEN GOOSE TRAVELLED WITH THE SEVEN
THE WALLS OF THE BUILDING WERE OF TRANSPARENT PORCELAIN VARIOUSLY COLOURED AND REPRESENTED THE HISTORY OF ALL THE FAIRIES THAT HAD EXISTED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD THE PRINCE COMING BACK TO THE GOLDEN DOOR OBSERVED A DEER'S FOOT
THE LORDS WHO HAD COURTED HIM IN THE DAYS OF HIS SPLENDOUR NOW DECLINED TO HAVE ANY COMMUNICATION WITH HIM FOR THREE DAYS HE WANDERED ABOUT THE CITY EXCITING THE WONDER AND COMPASSION OF THE MULTITUDE
HAD SO PLACED HER WOMEN FROM THE GREAT HALL TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE THAT THE WORD WAS NO SOONER GIVEN THAT THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN WAS FALLEN BACKWARD THAN THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ALADDIN ADMITTED TO THE HALL
A CROWD OF CHILDREN COLLECTED WHO HOOTED AND THOUGHT HIM AS DID ALL WHO CHANCED TO BE PASSING BY A MADMAN OR A FOOL TO OFFER TO CHANGE NEW LAMPS FOR OLD ONES
HE WAS STOPPED BY THE HANDS AND A LARGE EASY CHAIR ADVANCED OF ITSELF TOWARDS THE CHIMNEY AND THE HANDS WHICH HE OBSERVED WERE EXTREMELY WHITE AND DELICATE TOOK OFF HIS WET CLOTHES AND SUPPLIED THEIR PLACE WITH THE
AND BEFORE HE LEFT HOME HIS MOTHER PREPARED BEAUTIFUL PANCAKES AND A BOTTLE OF WINE FOR HIM TO TAKE WITH HIM SO THAT HE MIGHT NOT SUFFER FROM HUNGER OR THIRST AS HE ENTERED THE FOREST HE MET A GRAY OLD MAN WHO BADE HIM GOOD MORNING
IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT IN THEIR HEARTS THEY WERE VERY GLAD IN A SHORT TIME ALL THIS PICTURE WENT AWAY OUT OF THE GLASS BUT BEAUTY BEGAN TO THINK THAT THE BEAST WAS VERY KIND TO HER AND THAT SHE HAD NO NEED TO BE AFRAID OF HIM
THEY THEN WISHED EACH OTHER GOOD NIGHT AND WENT TO BED BOTH OF THEM THINKING THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CLOSE THEIR EYES BUT AS SOON AS EVER THEY HAD LAID DOWN THEY FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP AND DID NOT WAKE TILL MORNING BEAUTY DREAMED THAT A LADY CAME UP TO HER WHO SAID
WHO WAS TO BE HIS COMPANION WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY CAUGHT BY A SMALL FIGURE NOT A FOOT HIGH WHICH JUST THEN ENTERED THE ROOM AND ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM IT HAD ON
THE MERCHANT HAD VERY LITTLE APPETITE BUT BEAUTY THAT SHE MIGHT THE BETTER HIDE HER GRIEF PLACED HERSELF AT THE TABLE AND HELPED HER FATHER SHE THEN BEGAN HERSELF TO EAT AND THOUGHT ALL THE TIME THAT TO BE SURE THE BEAST HAD A MIND TO FATTEN HER
I HAVE IN MY PALACE SOME CATS THAT ARE PERFECTLY CLEVER IN MAKING SUCH CAMBRIC AS THE KING REQUIRES SO
YOUR WIFE MAKES THIS PERNICIOUS DEMAND HIS DESIGN IS TO KILL YOU THEREFORE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AFTER THESE WORDS THE GENIE DISAPPEARED ALADDIN RESOLVED AT ONCE WHAT TO DO
YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL AND I THINK MYSELF VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU HE THEN TURNED TOWARDS HER FATHER AND SAID TO HIM GOOD MAN YOU MAY LEAVE THE PALACE TO MORROW MORNING AND TAKE CARE NEVER TO COME BACK TO IT AGAIN
AND DEMANDED AN IMMEDIATE AUDIENCE OF THE KING WHO RECEIVED THEM WITH THE GREATEST KINDNESS THE PRINCES HASTENED TO PLACE AT THE FEET OF HIS MAJESTY THE CURIOUS PRESENT HE HAD REQUIRED THEM TO PROCURE THE ELDEST
AND ONE OF THEM PRETENDED TO BE A NURSE AND AT LAST GOT THE MOTHER AND CHILD INTO THEIR POWER THEY SHUT THE QUEEN UP IN THE BATH AND TRIED TO SUFFOCATE HER AND THE OLD WOMAN PUT HER OWN UGLY DAUGHTER IN THE QUEEN'S BED
HE TURNED UPON HIS OTHER HEEL AND REJOINED HER SHE LOOKED ANGRY STILL BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS GUILTY OR WHAT WAS MUCH THE SAME KNEW THAT HE THOUGHT SO
WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE OF ALADDIN AS SOON AS THE PEOPLE SAW THE HOLY WOMAN AS THEY IMAGINED HIM TO BE THEY PRESENTLY GATHERED ABOUT HIM IN A GREAT CROWD SOME BEGGED HIS BLESSING OTHERS KISSED HIS HAND AND OTHERS MORE RESERVED ONLY THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT
WON'T I JUST THE DAY DREW NEAR WHEN THE INFANT MUST BE CHRISTENED THE KING WROTE ALL THE INVITATIONS WITH HIS OWN HAND OF COURSE SOMEBODY WAS FORGOTTEN NOW IT DOES NOT GENERALLY MATTER IF SOMEBODY IS FORGOTTEN
THEY WILL NOT HUNT ME UNLESS THEY SEE ME RUNNING AND I DON'T MEAN TO DO THAT BUT HIS SISTER WEPT AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO IF THEY KILL YOU DEAR FAWN I SHALL BE HERE ALONE IN THE FOREST FORSAKEN BY THE WHOLE WORLD
ONE NIGHT AS SHE LAY HALF ASLEEP SHE TURNED HERSELF ABOUT AND OPENING HER EYES PERCEIVED A LITTLE OLD WOMAN VERY UGLY AND DEFORMED SEATED IN THE EASY CHAIR BY HER BEDSIDE
AFTER WAITING AND WAITING IN VAIN FOR AN INVITATION SHE MADE UP HER MIND AT LAST TO GO WITHOUT ONE AND MAKE THE WHOLE FAMILY MISERABLE LIKE A PRINCESS AS SHE WAS SO SHE PUT ON HER BEST GOWN WENT TO THE PALACE
THE PRINCESS WHO KNEW NOT THE VALUE OF THIS LAMP AND THE INTEREST THAT ALADDIN HAD TO KEEP IT SAFE ENTERED INTO THE PLEASANTRY AND COMMANDED A SLAVE TO TAKE IT AND MAKE THE EXCHANGE THE SLAVE OBEYED WENT OUT OF THE HALL AND NO SOONER GOT TO THE PALACE GATES
I HAVE SENT TO HAVE THE PRIVATE DOOR OPENED FOR YOU ENTER AND COME UP THE PRIVATE DOOR WHICH WAS JUST UNDER THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT WAS SOON OPENED AND ALADDIN CONDUCTED UP INTO THE CHAMBER
WAS TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BEFORE HE THOUGHT OF GETTING UP WHEN HE WAS AMAZED TO SEE A HANDSOME NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES LAID READY FOR HIM INSTEAD OF HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD SPOILED TO BE SURE SAID HE TO HIMSELF THIS PLACE BELONGS TO SOME GOOD FAIRY
WHEN THE PRINCESS HER WOMEN AND SLAVES WERE GONE OUT OF THE HALL ALADDIN SHUT THE DOOR AND GOING DIRECTLY TO THE DEAD BODY OF THE MAGICIAN OPENED HIS VEST TOOK OUT THE LAMP WHICH WAS CAREFULLY WRAPPED UP AND RUBBING IT THE GENIE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED GENIE SAID ALADDIN
FOR SHE BEAT ALL THE WICKED FAIRIES IN WICKEDNESS AND ALL THE CLEVER ONES IN CLEVERNESS SHE DESPISED ALL THE MODES WE READ OF IN HISTORY IN WHICH OFFENDED FAIRIES AND WITCHES HAVE TAKEN THEIR REVENGES AND THEREFORE
SHE LAUGHED WHEN SHE HEARD THAT THE ENEMY WAS ON HIS WAY TO BESIEGE HER FATHER'S CAPITAL SHE LAUGHED HUGELY BUT WHEN SHE WAS TOLD THAT THE CITY WOULD CERTAINLY BE ABANDONED TO THE MERCY OF THE ENEMY'S SOLDIERY WHY THEN SHE LAUGHED IMMODERATELY
SHE FLEW FROM HER ARMS TOWARDS THE CEILING HAPPILY THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR BROUGHT HER ASCENDING CAREER TO A CLOSE WITHIN A FOOT OF IT THERE SHE REMAINED HORIZONTAL AS WHEN SHE LEFT HER NURSE'S ARMS KICKING AND LAUGHING AMAZINGLY
I TOOK THE LARGEST OF THE PIECES OF MEAT TIED IT CLOSE ROUND ME WITH THE CLOTH OF MY TURBAN AND THEN LAID MYSELF UPON THE GROUND WITH MY FACE DOWNWARD THE BAG OF DIAMONDS BEING MADE FAST TO MY GIRDLE
I UPBRAIDED MYSELF A HUNDRED TIMES FOR NOT BEING CONTENT WITH THE PRODUCE OF MY FIRST VOYAGE
BEAUTIFUL LADY HIS EYES HAD EVER SEEN STOOD BEFORE HIM AND BEFORE HE HAD SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE TO SPEAK TO HER A LONG TRAIN OF ATTENDANTS WHO AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THEIR MISTRESS WERE CHANGED TO THEIR NATURAL SHAPES
AFTER THE JUICE IS THUS DRAWN OUT THE TREE WITHERS AND DIES
IF WE COULD ONLY FIND A BROOK OR A STREAM HE STOPPED TO LISTEN AND SAID STAY I THINK I HEAR A RUNNING STREAM SO HE TOOK HIS SISTER BY THE HAND AND THEY RAN TOGETHER TO FIND IT
WHEN HE FOUND SITTING AT THE ROOTS A GOOSE WHOSE FEATHERS WERE OF PURE GOLD HE TOOK IT UP AND INSTEAD OF GOING HOME CARRIED IT WITH HIM TO AN INN AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WHERE HE INTENDED TO PASS THE NIGHT
UPON THIS HE LED THE MAN INTO THE KING'S CELLAR WHERE HE OPENED THE CASKS ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND DRANK AND DRANK TILL HIS BACK ACHED AND BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED HE HAD QUITE EMPTIED THE KING'S CELLAR AGAIN THE YOUNG MAN ASKED FOR HIS BRIDE
I TAKE YOUR INTENTION KINDLY SAID THE SULTAN AND WILL GIVE ORDERS ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SULTAN HAD FINISHED THIS MAGNIFICENT ENTERTAINMENT PROVIDED FOR HIM AND FOR HIS COURT BY ALADDIN
BUT THE SECOND SON ANSWERED RUDELY WHAT I MIGHT GIVE TO YOU I SHALL WANT MYSELF SO BE OFF THEN HE LEFT THE LITTLE OLD MAN STANDING IN THE ROAD AND WALKED ON HIS PUNISHMENT SOON CAME
AM NOT I WICKED SAID SHE TO BEHAVE SO ILL TO A BEAST WHO HAS SHOWN ME SO MUCH KINDNESS WHY WILL I NOT MARRY HIM I AM SURE I SHOULD BE MORE HAPPY WITH HIM THAN MY SISTERS ARE WITH THEIR HUSBANDS
BUT HAVING WAITED SIX WEEKS WITHOUT SEEING ANY ONE PASS THE GATES SHE FELL SICK OF VEXATION AND HER LIFE WAS DESPAIRED OF
SHAME ON YOU RAGGEDY ANN YOU'VE BEEN IN THE PANTRY AND ALL THE OTHERS TOO AND WITH THIS THE DOLLS MISTRESS DROPPED RAGGEDY ANN ON THE FLOOR AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN SHE CAME BACK SHE HAD ON AN APRON AND HER SLEEVES WERE ROLLED UP
ASKED UNCLE CLEM I WAITED AROUND THE BARN UNTIL MAMMA CAT WENT UP TO THE HOUSE AND THEN I SLIPPED INTO THE BARN AGAIN FOR I KNEW THERE MUST BE SOMETHING INSIDE OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE JUMPED AT ME THAT WAY
IT WAS HARD WORK GETTING RAGGEDY THROUGH THE WRINGER BUT DINAH WAS VERY STRONG AND OF COURSE IT HAPPENED
THEN MAMMA CAT CAME OVER TO THE BASKET AND SAW ALL THE DOLLS I'M S'PRISED AT YOU MAMMA CAT SAID RAGGEDY ANN FIDO HAS BEEN WATCHING YOUR KITTENS FOR AN HOUR WHILE YOU WERE AWAY HE WOULDN'T HURT THEM FOR ANYTHING
SO SHE LEFT THE DOLLIES SITTING AROUND THE TINY TABLE AND RAN DOWN STAIRS CARRYING RAGGEDY ANN WITH HER MAMA DADDY AND A STRANGE MAN WERE TALKING IN THE LIVING ROOM AND DADDY INTRODUCED MARCELLA TO THE STRANGER
EXCEPT THAT I AM MORE WORN FOR EACH NEW RAG DOLL HAS A CANDY HEART AND ON IT IS WRITTEN I LOVE YOU JUST AS IS WRITTEN ON MY OWN CANDY HEART
IT WAS RATHER STUFFY IN THERE BUT I DID NOT MIND IT IN FACT I BELIEVE I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP FOR WHEN I AWAKENED I SAW THE STRANGER FRIEND'S HAND REACHING INTO THE GRIP THEN HE LIFTED ME FROM THE GRIP AND DANCED ME UPON HIS KNEE
IT WAS JUST THEN THAT MARCELLA RETURNED AND SAW RAGGEDY WHY DINAH HOW COULD YOU MARCELLA HAD SOBBED AS SHE SNATCHED THE FLATTENED RAGGEDY ANN FROM THE BEWILDERED DINAH'S HAND
THE INDIAN DOLL FOUND SOME CORN BREAD AND DIPPING IT IN THE MOLASSES HE SAT DOWN FOR A GOOD FEAST A JAR OF RASPBERRY JAM WAS OVERTURNED AND THE DOLLIES ATE OF THIS UNTIL THEIR FACES WERE ALL PURPLE
QUICK AS A WINK ALL THE DOLLS TOOK THE SAME POSITIONS IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN PLACED BY MARCELLA FOR THEY DID NOT WISH REALLY TRULY PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THEY COULD MOVE ABOUT BUT IT WAS ONLY FIDO
WHAT IS THE TROUBLE DEAR MAMMA ASKED AS SHE CAME OUT THE DOOR AND KNELT BESIDE THE LITTLE FIGURE SHAKING WITH SOBS MARCELLA HELD OUT RAGGEDY ANN BUT SUCH A COMICAL LOOKING RAGGEDY ANN
AND FELL AND WAS LOST SO NOW I AM VERY CAREFUL WITH HER WOULD YOU LET ME TAKE RAGGEDY ANN FOR A FEW DAYS ASKED THE NEW FRIEND
WHEN RAGGEDY ANN TOOK HER ARMS FROM AROUND BOOTS THE KITTEN WAS VERY ANGRY SHE LAID HER EARS BACK AND SCRATCHED RAGGEDY ANN WITH HER CLAWS BUT RAGGEDY ANN ONLY SMILED IT DID NOT HURT HER A BIT FOR RAGGEDY WAS SEWED TOGETHER WITH A NEEDLE AND THREAD
THE TIN SOLDIER FELL FROM THE SHELF THREE TIMES AND BENT ONE OF HIS TIN LEGS BUT HE SCRAMBLED RIGHT BACK UP AGAIN NEVER HAD THE DOLLS HAD SO MUCH FUN AND EXCITEMENT AND THEY HAD ALL EATEN THEIR FILL WHEN THEY HEARD THE CLICK OF THE FRONT
MAMMA AND DADDY SAID THE KITTENS COULD STAY IN THE NURSERY AND BELONG TO MARCELLA
HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE PIANO MARCELLA PICKED UP RAGGEDY ANN AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE NURSERY WHEN SHE LEFT TELLING THE DOLLS TO BE REAL GOOD CHILDREN WHILE MAMMA IS AWAY
IN THE CENTER OF THE BRIDGE FIDO CAUGHT UP WITH THE NEW PUPPY DOG AND THEY HAD A LIVELY TUG OF WAR WITH RAGGEDY ANN STRETCHED BETWEEN THEN AS THEY PULLED AND TUGGED AND FLOPPED RAGGEDY ANN ABOUT
DINAH COULD NOT SEE RAGGEDY ANN EITHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE STEAM SO DINAH USING AN OLD BROOM HANDLE STIRRED THE CLOTHES IN THE BOILER AND THE CLOTHES AND RAGGEDY ANN WERE STIRRED AND WHIRLED AROUND UNTIL ALL WERE THOROUGHLY BOILED
AND WRAPPED A RAG AROUND IT TO HOLD IT UNTIL THE GLUE DRIED SHE SAID WHEN I TELL YOU OF THIS WONDERFUL ADVENTURE I KNOW YOU WILL ALL FEEL VERY HAPPY IT HAS MADE ME ALMOST BURST MY STITCHES WITH JOY
WHICH MADE IT A BEAUTIFUL LAVENDER COLOR AND LITTLE BABY TEENY WEENY COOKIES WITH POWDERED SUGAR ON THEM AFTER THIS LOVELY DINNER THE DOLLIES WERE TAKEN IN THE HOUSE WHERE THEY HAD THEIR HAIR BRUSHED AND NICE CLEAN NIGHTIES PUT ON
THE DOLLS ALL SAT UPON THE FLOOR AROUND RAGGEDY ANN THE TIN SOLDIER WITH HIS ARM OVER HER SHOULDER WELL FIRST WHEN I LEFT SAID RAGGEDY ANN I WAS PLACED IN THE STRANGER FRIEND'S GRIP
HE WALKED OVER TO THE TABLE AND SNIFFED IN HOPES MARCELLA HAD GIVEN THE DOLLS REAL FOOD AND THAT SOME WOULD STILL BE LEFT WHERE'S RAGGEDY ANN FIDO ASKED
EXACTLY LIKE MINE I KNOW HOW WE COULD TELL YOU FROM THE OTHER RAG DOLLS EVEN IF YOU ALL LOOK EXACTLY ALIKE SAID THE INDIAN DOLL WHO HAD BEEN THINKING FOR A LONG TIME
PERHAPS SHE HAD CLIMBED OUT OF BED BACKWARDS FOR MARCELLA COMPLAINED TO EACH DOLL AS SHE DRESSED THEM AND WHEN IT CAME RAGGEDY'S TIME TO BE DRESSED
FOR RAGGEDY ANN'S SMILE WAS ALMOST TWICE AS BROAD AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE JUST LET ME HANG MISS RAGGEDY ON THE LINE IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE FOR HALF AN HOUR SAID DINAH AND YOU WON'T KNOW HER WHEN SHE COMES OFF SO RAGGEDY ANN WAS PINNED TO THE CLOTHES LINE
BUT BY THIS TIME THE WATER HAD THOROUGHLY SOAKED THROUGH RAGGEDY ANN'S NICE CLEAN WHITE COTTON STUFFING AND SHE WAS SO HEAVY SHE COULD NOT CLIMB SO THERE SHE HAD TO STAY UNTIL MARCELLA AND DADDY CAME ALONG AND FOUND HER
OUR MISTRESS GAVE US THE NICE DINNER OUT UNDER THE TREES TO TEACH US A LESSON SHE WISHED US TO KNOW THAT WE COULD HAVE HAD ALL THE GOODIES WE WISHED WHENEVER WE WISHED
I AM SO HAPPY I DO NOT FEEL A BIT SLEEPY DO YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THE WATER SOAKED ME SO THOROUGHLY MY CANDY HEART MUST HAVE MELTED AND FILLED MY WHOLE BODY
MAMMA HAD TO SMILE IN SPITE OF HER SYMPATHY FOR RAGGEDY ANN LOOKED RIDICULOUS DINAH'S BIG EYES ROLLED OUT IN A TROUBLED MANNER FOR MARCELLA HAD SNATCHED RAGGEDY ANN FROM DINAH'S HAND AS SHE CRIED WHY DINAH HOW COULD YOU
AND OUR LESSON WAS THAT WE MUST NEVER TAKE WITHOUT ASKING
SO SHE PROMISED TO SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN BOOTS WAS THE ONLY ONE AWAKE OUT POPPED A TINY MOUSE FROM THE HOLE
THEN SHE TOOK RAGGEDY ANN INTO THE HOUSE AND SHOWED MARCELLA AND MAMMA HOW CLEAN AND SWEET SHE WAS
AND SHE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER NOW BY THIS TIME BOOTS WAS ONE OF THE FAMILY AND DID NOT CRY AT NIGHT BESIDES
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE STOPPING AND PRETENDING HE WAS VERY ANGRY WHEN HE PRETENDED THIS FIDO WOULD GIVE RAGGEDY ANN A GREAT SHAKING MAKING HER YARN HEAD HIT THE GROUND RATTY TAT TAT
BUT NO SHE FLOATED NICELY FOR SHE WAS STUFFED WITH CLEAN WHITE COTTON AND THE WATER DIDN'T SOAK THROUGH VERY QUICKLY AFTER A WHILE THE STRANGE PUPPY AND FIDO GREW TIRED OF RUNNING ALONG THE BANK AND THE STRANGE PUPPY SCAMPERED HOME OVER THE MEADOW
I CAN EASILY DO THAT CRIED THE TIN SOLDIER AS HE RAISED HIS GUN OH RAGGEDY ANN CRIED THE FRENCH DOLLY PLEASE DO NOT LET HIM SHOOT NO SAID RAGGEDY ANN
RAGGEDY ANN JUMPED FROM HER BED AND RAN OVER TO FIDO'S BASKET HE WASN'T THERE
MAMMA PATTED MARCELLA'S HAND AND SOON COAXED HER TO QUIT SOBBING WHEN DINAH EXPLAINED THAT THE FIRST SHE KNEW OF RAGGEDY BEING IN THE WASH WAS WHEN SHE TOOK HER FROM THE BOILER MARCELLA BEGAN CRYING AGAIN
MAMMA SAID SHE THOUGHT THE CAKE MUST BE FINISHED AND SHE TOOK FROM THE OVEN A LOVELY CHOCOLATE CAKE AND GAVE MARCELLA A LARGE PIECE TO HAVE ANOTHER TEA PARTY WITH THAT NIGHT WHEN ALL THE HOUSE WAS ASLEEP
I MEAN SAID RAGGEDY ANN THAT THE STRANGER FRIEND HAD BORROWED ME FROM MARCELLA SO THAT HE COULD HAVE PATTERNS MADE FROM ME AND BEFORE I LEFT THE BIG CLEAN WHITE ROOM
ASKED RAGGEDY ANN WITH A LAUGH BY FEELING YOUR CANDY HEART IF THE DOLL HAS A CANDY HEART THEN IT IS YOU RAGGEDY ANN
CRIED ALL THE DOLLS I CAN'T SEEM TO THINK CLEARLY TO DAY SAID RAGGEDY ANN IT FEELS AS IF MY HEAD WERE RIPPED AT THIS THE FRENCH DOLL RAN TO RAGGEDY ANN AND TOOK OFF HER BONNET
RAGGEDY ANN SAID SO THE INDIAN RAN AND BROUGHT A BOTTLE OF GLUE WHERE'S THE HAND RAGGEDY ASKED
SAID FIDO AS HE SCRATCHED HIS EAR IS IT A SECRET ASKED THE PENNY DOLLS SECRET NOTHING REPLIED FIDO IT'S KITTENS
SHE REMEMBERED THAT MORNING WHEN MARCELLA CAME TO THE NURSERY TO TAKE THE NIGHTIES FROM THE DOLLS AND DRESS THEM SHE HAD BEEN CROSS
WHEN MARCELLA HAD A TEA PARTY OUT IN THE ORCHARD OF COURSE ALL OF THE DOLLS WERE INVITED RAGGEDY ANN THE TIN SOLDIER THE INDIAN DOLL AND ALL THE OTHERS
THIS WOULD CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS BARRIER TO ADVANCES IN COMPOSITION TO OBVIATE THESE DISADVANTAGES A SYSTEM OF EQUAL TEMPERAMENT WAS INVENTED AND HAS BEEN IN UNIVERSAL USE SINCE THE TIME OF BACH SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTEEN FIFTY WHO WAS THE FIRST PROMINENT COMPOSER TO USE IT EXTENSIVELY

THIS GAVE RISE TO THE REMARK MORE HUMOROUS THAN PROFOUND THAT WE STOOD AROUND THE CAMPS WITH CLUBS TO KEEP ONE SET IN AND AN OTHER SET OUT
WE MAY REGRET IT I REGRET IT MOST PROFOUNDLY BUT I CAN NOT DENY THE TRUTH OF THE FACT PAINFUL AND MORTIFYING AS IT IS I PROCLAIM BOLDLY THE POLICY OF THOSE WITH WHOM I ACT WE ARE FOR PEACE
TO FIND STATES REFERRED TO AS PERSONS COMPOSING COMBINATIONS AND THAT THE SOVEREIGN CREATORS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATES OF THE UNION SHOULD BE COMMANDED BY THEIR AGENT TO DISPERSE THE LEVY OF SO LARGE AN ARMY COULD ONLY MEAN WAR
HOWEVER EMINENT FROM AUTHORITY SECOND ONLY IF AT ALL INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF THAT IS FROM THE ACTS OR ORDINANCES OF RATIFICATION BY THE STATES THEY CERTAINLY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CONCLUSIVE AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNKNOWN TO MISTER WEBSTER
WHICH WE WERE ABOUT TO LOOK TO SEE IT EXTENDED OVER THE CONTINENT GIVING A PROTECTING ARM TO INFANT REPUBLICS THAT NEED IT IF THIS TEMPLE IS TOTTERING ON ITS PILLARS WHAT I ASK CAN BE A HIGHER OR NOBLER DUTY
WE MUST CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE FOR OUR INHERENT RIGHT TO FREEDOM INDEPENDENCE AND SELF GOVERNMENT AT THIS SESSION CONGRESS PASSED ACTS AUTHORIZING THE PRESIDENT TO USE THE WHOLE LAND AND NAVAL FORCE TO MEET THE NECESSITIES OF THE WAR THUS COMMENCED
AND ATTRIBUTING THE USE OF THE TERMS WHICH HE ATTACKS TO AN ULTERIOR PURPOSE MISTER WEBSTER SAYS THIS IS THE REASON SIR WHICH MAKES IT NECESSARY TO ABANDON THE USE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE FOR A NEW VOCABULARY

BUT THEY HAVE BEEN CALLED IN QUESTION BY THE MODERN SCHOOL OF CONSOLIDATION THESE GENTLEMEN ADMIT THAT THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION WAS A COMPACT
HE ACTS CONSCIENTIOUSLY IN INSISTING UPON CONGRESS NOT USURPING IT IF ANY ONE BELIEVES THAT THE SQUATTERS UPON THE LANDS OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN A TERRITORY ARE INVESTED WITH SOVEREIGNTY

TWO DAYS HAD ELAPSED BETWEEN THE SURRENDER OF FORT SUMTER AND THE PROCLAMATION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN CALLING FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILITIA AS BEFORE STATED
TO EXCLUDE THE CONGRESS FROM ANY KIND OF LEGISLATION WHATEVER I AM AT A LOSS TO CONCEIVE CERTAIN IT IS IT WAS NOT THE THEORY OF THAT PERIOD AND IT WAS NOT CONTENDED FOR IN ALL THE CONTROVERSIES WE HAD THEN
NO SUCH TRANSFER IN WHOLE OR IN PART EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED THEY RETAINED AND INTENDED TO RETAIN THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IN ITS INTEGRITY UNDIVIDED AND INDIVISIBLE
TO PERFORM HIS PUBLIC DUTY HAVING TAKEN WITH HIM HIS NEGRO SLAVE THE COURT HOWEVER IN GIVING THEIR DECISION IN THIS CASE OR THEIR OPINION
APRIL ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE TWO P M
OR DENY TO IT THE BENEFIT OF THE PROVISIONS AND GUARANTEES WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY
JAMES WILSON OF PENNSYLVANIA SAID SOVEREIGNTY IS IN THE PEOPLE BEFORE THEY MAKE A CONSTITUTION AND REMAINS IN THEM
WHICH CONTINUED TO INCREASE AND BEFORE DAYLIGHT THE WORK OF DESTRUCTION EXTENDED TO TWO IMMENSE SHIP HOUSES ONE OF WHICH CONTAINED THE ENTIRE FRAME OF A SEVENTY FOUR GUN SHIP AND TO THE LONG RANGES OF STORES AND OFFICES ON EACH SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE THE GREAT SHIP PENNSYLVANIA WAS BURNED
CONTENDED THAT MEN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO HOME AND ATTEND TO THEIR PRIVATE AFFAIRS WHILE THERE WERE NO ACTIVE OPERATIONS AND THAT THERE WAS NO DOUBT BUT THAT THEY WOULD RETURN WHENEVER THERE WAS TO BE A BATTLE
AND THE OTHER THE EXPONENT OF SOVEREIGN POWER THE SUPREME COURT HAVE COVERED THE WHOLE GROUND OF THE RELATION OF THE CONGRESS TO THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURES
OF THE WAR WHICH ENSUED IN IT THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN TO SUPPRESS COMBINATIONS OPPOSED TO THE LAWS AND OBSTRUCTING THEIR EXECUTION IN SEVEN SOVEREIGN STATES WHICH HAD RETIRED FROM THE UNION
TO MY SURPRISE AND DISAPPOINTMENT THE EFFECTIVE STRENGTH WAS STATED TO BE BUT LITTLE GREATER THAN WHEN IT FOUGHT THE BATTLE OF THE TWENTY FIRST OF THE PRECEDING JULY THE FREQUENT REENFORCEMENTS
ON THE FIFTEENTH OF MARCH OFFERED A RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE GARRISONS FROM ALL FORTS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE STATES WHICH HAD SECEDED EXCEPT THOSE AT KEY WEST AND THE DRY TORTUGAS IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION HE SAID
BECAUSE THESE ARE BUT THE OFFSPRING OR CREATURES OF THE UNION AND MUST OF COURSE BE SUBORDINATE AND DEPENDENT THIS OBJECTION WOULD SCARCELY OCCUR TO ANY INSTRUCTED MIND THOUGH IT MAY POSSESS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SPECIOUS PLAUSIBILITY FOR THE UNTAUGHT
A DECLARATION OF WAR THE GENERAL IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY ALSO IT IS WELL KNOWN URGENTLY ADVISED THE EVACUATION OF THE FORTS
TO BRING THE PRACTICE AND THE LAW INTO CONFORMITY RECENTLY REPORTS HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR FROM THE COMMANDERS OF SEPARATE ARMIES AS TO THE COMPOSITION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS
I DENY THIS RIGHT TO THE TERRITORIAL CONDITION BECAUSE THE TERRITORY BELONGS IN COMMON TO THE STATES EVERY CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES AS A JOINT OWNER OF THAT TERRITORY HAS A RIGHT TO GO INTO IT
OF THE UNITED STATES IS BUT TO REPEAT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ON THE ABSENCE OF ANY AUTHORITY IN THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT TO COERCE A STATE IN ANY POSSIBLE VIEW OF THE CASE THEREFORE THE CONCLUSION MUST BE
TWO HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS
TO RAISE A LOAN OF MONEY ON THE CREDIT OF THE STATE OR TO PLEDGE THE FAITH OF THE STATE FOR THE PAYMENT OR REDEMPTION OF ANY LOAN OR DEBT
BUT THE ADVANTAGES ARE BELIEVED TO OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES OF THAT ARRANGEMENT IN DISTRIBUTING THE REGIMENTS OF THE SEVERAL STATES IT WOULD I THINK BE BETTER TO PLACE THE REGIMENTS
BUT IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT THE THREATS IMPLIED IN THE DECLARATIONS THAT THE UNION COULD NOT EXIST PART SLAVE AND PART FREE AND THAT THE UNION SHOULD BE PRESERVED
THE TYRANNY OF AN UNBRIDLED MAJORITY THE MOST ODIOUS AND THE LEAST RESPONSIBLE FORM OF DESPOTISM HAS DENIED US BOTH THE RIGHT AND THE REMEDY THEREFORE
AS TO LEAD TO CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GENERALS WHICH WILL BE BEST UNDERSTOOD BY THE FOLLOWING EXTRACTS FROM MY LETTERS TO THEM WHICH ARE HERE APPENDED
THERE WERE THOSE WHO BELIEVED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE THE POWER OF REVISION OVER THE LAWS OF A STATE IT WAS LONG AND ABLY CONTENDED FOR IN THE CONVENTION WHICH FORMED THE CONSTITUTION
FOR HE MADE A GOOD JOINER AND BECAME A VERY HONEST MAN
I GRANT ALL YOU SAY SAID CACAMBO BUT WE HAVE STILL TWO SHEEP REMAINING WITH MORE TREASURE THAN THE KING OF SPAIN WILL EVER HAVE
PAQUETTE CONTINUED HER TRADE WHEREVER SHE WENT BUT MADE NOTHING OF IT
OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM BUT AFTER ALL THESE TWO GIRLS BEGIN TO WEARY ME
YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
AND OBLIGED TO CONTINUE THIS ABOMINABLE TRADE WHICH APPEARS SO PLEASANT TO YOU MEN WHILE TO US WOMEN IT IS THE UTMOST ABYSS OF MISERY I HAVE COME TO EXERCISE THE PROFESSION AT VENICE
WHEREAS MARTIN HAD NOTHING AT ALL TO HOPE BESIDES CANDIDE WAS POSSESSED OF MONEY AND JEWELS
THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE AND AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
IN POINTING OUT FAULTS WHERE OTHERS SEE NOTHING BUT BEAUTIES THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL
AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO
I SAY WHAT I THINK AND I CARE VERY LITTLE WHETHER OTHERS THINK AS I DO
I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
HA SAID PANGLOSS TO PAQUETTE PROVIDENCE HAS THEN BROUGHT YOU AMONGST US AGAIN MY POOR CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COST ME THE TIP OF MY NOSE AN EYE AND AN EAR AS YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WORLD IS THIS
PLATO OBSERVED A LONG WHILE AGO THAT THOSE STOMACHS ARE NOT THE BEST THAT REJECT ALL SORTS OF FOOD
I KNOW OF NOTHING IN SO BAD A TASTE SAID THE MASTER ALL YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY TRIFLING AFTER TO MORROW I WILL HAVE IT PLANTED WITH A NOBLER DESIGN
WHO SAID TO HIS FRIEND YOU SEE THAT ALREADY I HAVE WON HALF THE WAGER
IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES
YOU SEE THAT ALREADY I HAVE WON HALF THE WAGER FRIAR GIROFLEE STAYED IN THE DINING ROOM AND DRANK A GLASS OR TWO OF WINE WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR DINNER BUT SAID CANDIDE TO PAQUETTE YOU LOOKED SO GAY AND CONTENT WHEN I MET YOU
COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
OH OH SAID THE PRUDENT VANDERDENDUR TO HIMSELF THIS STRANGER GIVES TEN THOUSAND PIASTRES UNHESITATINGLY HE MUST BE VERY RICH RETURNING A LITTLE WHILE AFTER
I AM ONE SAID MARTIN I CANNOT HELP IT I KNOW NOT HOW TO THINK OTHERWISE
I CONCLUDED THAT I KNEW AS MUCH AS HE AND THAT I HAD NO NEED OF A GUIDE TO LEARN IGNORANCE HA HERE ARE FOUR SCORE VOLUMES OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CRIED MARTIN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING VALUABLE IN THIS COLLECTION
I HAVE LIVED SAID MARTIN
CANDIDE BEING DESIROUS OF SELECTING FROM AMONG THE BEST MARKED OUT ABOUT ONE TWENTIETH OF THEM WHO SEEMED TO BE SOCIABLE MEN AND WHO ALL PRETENDED TO MERIT HIS PREFERENCE
THIS PHILOSOPHER WAS AN HONEST MAN BUT HE HAD BEEN ROBBED BY HIS WIFE BEATEN BY HIS SON AND ABANDONED BY HIS DAUGHTER WHO GOT A PORTUGUESE TO RUN AWAY WITH HER HE HAD JUST BEEN DEPRIVED OF A SMALL EMPLOYMENT ON WHICH HE SUBSISTED
I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY
SUCH SPECTACLES AS THESE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF THEIR DISSERTATIONS AND WHEN THEY DID NOT DISPUTE TIME HUNG SO HEAVILY UPON THEIR HANDS THAT ONE DAY THE OLD WOMAN VENTURED TO SAY TO THEM I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE
HITHERTO I HAVE MET WITH NONE BUT UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE HABITABLE GLOBE EXCEPT IN EL DORADO BUT AS TO THIS PAIR I WOULD VENTURE TO LAY A WAGER THAT THEY ARE VERY HAPPY I LAY YOU THEY ARE NOT SAID MARTIN
I HAVE SOMETIMES ASKED LEARNED MEN WHETHER THEY WERE NOT AS WEARY AS I OF THAT WORK THOSE WHO WERE SINCERE HAVE OWNED TO ME THAT THE POEM MADE THEM FALL ASLEEP YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY
HIS WIFE BECAME UGLIER EVERY DAY MORE PEEVISH AND UNSUPPORTABLE THE OLD WOMAN WAS INFIRM AND EVEN MORE FRETFUL THAN CUNEGONDE CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE
FIRST OF ALL LET HIM PAY DOWN THE THIRTY THOUSAND PIASTRES THEN WE SHALL SEE CANDIDE SOLD TWO SMALL DIAMONDS THE LEAST OF WHICH WAS WORTH MORE THAN WHAT THE SKIPPER ASKED FOR HIS FREIGHT HE PAID HIM IN ADVANCE
OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM
MY PARENTS FORCED ME AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN TO PUT ON THIS DETESTABLE HABIT TO INCREASE THE FORTUNE OF A CURSED ELDER BROTHER WHOM GOD CONFOUND JEALOUSY DISCORD AND FURY DWELL IN THE CONVENT
THE FRENCH CAPTAIN SOON SAW THAT THE CAPTAIN OF THE VICTORIOUS VESSEL WAS A SPANIARD AND THAT THE OTHER WAS A DUTCH PIRATE
TOWARDS THE LATTER END OF A REPAST HE INCLINED TO PANGLOSS'S DOCTRINE BUT YOU MISTER MARTIN SAID HE TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL THIS WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS ON MORAL AND NATURAL EVIL
THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
THEY SAW TWO SHIPS IN CLOSE FIGHT ABOUT THREE MILES OFF THE WIND BROUGHT BOTH SO NEAR TO THE FRENCH VESSEL THAT OUR TRAVELLERS HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE FIGHT AT THEIR EASE
BUT SHE BECAME AN EXCELLENT PASTRY COOK
THE FRENCH AND SPANISH SHIPS CONTINUED THEIR COURSE AND CANDIDE CONTINUED HIS CONVERSATION WITH MARTIN THEY DISPUTED FIFTEEN SUCCESSIVE DAYS AND ON THE LAST OF THOSE FIFTEEN DAYS THEY WERE AS FAR ADVANCED AS ON THE FIRST
I WAS SOON SUPPLANTED BY A RIVAL TURNED OUT OF DOORS QUITE DESTITUTE AND OBLIGED TO CONTINUE THIS ABOMINABLE TRADE
THE GIRL BLUSHED THE THEATIN ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND SHE FOLLOWED HIM
WELL SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR LEAVE YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER THIS OBSCURE WHIMSICAL AND DISAGREEABLE POEM WAS DESPISED UPON ITS FIRST PUBLICATION
SHE LOOKED AMOROUSLY AT HER THEATIN AND FROM TIME TO TIME PINCHED HIS FAT CHEEKS AT LEAST YOU WILL ALLOW ME SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN THAT THESE TWO ARE HAPPY
CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT
FOOLS ADMIRE EVERYTHING IN AN AUTHOR OF REPUTATION FOR MY PART I READ ONLY TO PLEASE MYSELF I LIKE ONLY THAT WHICH SERVES MY PURPOSE
KING NADAB THE SON OF JEROBOAM WAS KILLED BY BAASA
IF HE FIND HER HE WILL KEEP HER TO HIMSELF IF HE DO NOT FIND HER HE WILL GET ANOTHER I ADVISE YOU TO FORGET YOUR VALET CACAMBO AND YOUR MISTRESS CUNEGONDE MARTIN WAS NOT CONSOLING
BUT WHEN I RETURN AT NIGHT TO THE MONASTERY I AM READY TO DASH MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALLS OF THE DORMITORY AND ALL MY FELLOWS ARE IN THE SAME CASE
I KNOW OF NOTHING IN SO BAD A TASTE SAID THE MASTER ALL YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY TRIFLING AFTER TO MORROW I WILL HAVE IT PLANTED WITH A NOBLER DESIGN
NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN IN ITALY COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN THOSE MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCES AND THE MARRIAGE OF SIN AND DEATH AND THE SNAKES BROUGHT FORTH BY SIN
THE SWORD BELT OF THE AMAZON HIPPOLYTA THE AMAZONS INHABITED THE REGION OF THE RIVER THERMODON AND WERE A RACE OF STRONG WOMEN WHO FOLLOWED THE OCCUPATIONS OF MEN FROM THEIR CHILDREN THEY SELECTED ONLY SUCH AS WERE GIRLS
DIOMEDE WAS A SON OF MARS AND RULER OF THE BISTONIANS A VERY WARLIKE PEOPLE HE HAD MARES SO WILD AND STRONG THAT THEY HAD TO BE FASTENED WITH IRON CHAINS THEIR FODDER WAS CHIEFLY HAY
AND HERCULES WAS FORCED TO FIGHT WITH HIM BUT JUPITER DID NOT WISH THAT HIS SONS SHOULD SHED BLOOD AND SENT HIS LIGHTNING BOLT TO SEPARATE THE TWO
ONE DAY IT WOULD PLEASE TWARDOWSKI TO FLY WITHOUT WINGS THROUGH THE AIR ON ANOTHER TO THE DELIGHT OF THE CROWD TO GALLOP BACKWARD ON A COCK ON ANOTHER TO FLOAT IN A BOAT WITHOUT A RUDDER OR SAIL ACCOMPANIED BY SOME MAIDEN
BUT WHEN HE RETURNED AND FOUND HIS OPPONENT CALMLY AWAITING DEATH HE WAS GENEROUS
OR VIKING EXACTING TRIBUTE FROM OTHER SHIPS OR SACKING THEM IF THEY WOULD NOT PAY TRIBUTE FOR THIS OCCUPATION IN THE DAYS OF FRITHIOF WAS CONSIDERED WHOLLY RESPECTABLE IT WAS FOLLOWED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY THE BRAVE MEN OF THE NORTH
AND WITH THE LION'S SKIN OVER HIS ARM TOOK HIS WAY BACK
RETURNED THE APPLES TO THE GARDEN OF THE HESPERIDES THE TWELFTH LABOR INSTEAD OF DESTROYING HIS HATED ENEMY THE LABORS WHICH EURYSTHEUS HAD IMPOSED UPON HERCULES
FOR FRITHIOF ALREADY LOVED THE FAIR MAIDEN AND VOWED THAT HE WOULD HAVE HER FOR HIS BRIDE AT ANY COST SOON AFTER THIS THE KING DIED LEAVING HIS KINGDOM TO HIS TWO SONS
AT LAST THE SEVEN YEARS WERE UP THE DEVIL APPEARED TO TWARDOWSKI AND SAID TWARDOWSKI THE TIME OF OUR PACT IS OVER AND I COMMAND YOU TO FULFILL YOUR PROMISE AND GO TO ROME WHAT SHALL I DO THERE
AND AS HE REPEATED MECHANICALLY THE PRAYER HIS MOTHER HAD TAUGHT HIM AN ANGEL SUDDENLY APPEARED AND SAID SATAN LET TWARDOWSKI GO AND YOU TWARDOWSKI HANG YOU THERE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
THAT THE LAND WOULD AGAIN BEAR FRUIT IF A STRANGER WERE SACRIFICED ONCE A YEAR TO JUPITER IN GRATITUDE BUSIRIS MADE A BEGINNING WITH THE PRIEST HIMSELF LATER HE FOUND GREAT PLEASURE IN THE CUSTOM AND KILLED ALL STRANGERS WHO CAME TO EGYPT
AND LANDED FIRST IN LIBYA HERE HE MET THE GIANT ANTAEUS WHOSE STRENGTH WAS RENEWED AS OFTEN AS HE TOUCHED THE EARTH HE ALSO FREED LIBYA OF BIRDS OF PREY FOR HE HATED WILD ANIMALS AND WICKED MEN BECAUSE HE SAW IN ALL OF THEM THE IMAGE OF THE OVERBEARING AND UNJUST LORD
NO MORE EXCLAMATIONS DO AS I TELL YOU
AND VAINLY COVERING THEMSELVES WITH THEIR SHIELDS FELL BEFORE THE ARROWS OF THE HERO
PROMETHEUS THE TITAN WHO WAS BOUND TO THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS AND CAME AT LAST TO THE PLACE WHERE ATLAS STOOD CARRYING THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAVENS ON HIS SHOULDERS NEAR HIM GREW THE TREE WHICH BORE THE GOLDEN APPLES OF THE HESPERIDES PROMETHEUS HAD ADVISED THE HERO
HOW OTHERWISE COULD I HOLD MY OWN AGAINST EURYSTHEUS AND THUS HE SOFTENED THE ANGER OF THE GODDESS AND BROUGHT THE ANIMAL TO MYCENE THE FOURTH LABOR THEN HERCULES SET OUT ON HIS FOURTH UNDERTAKING
WITH THIS WORK EURYSTHEUS WAS PLEASED AND AFTER HE HAD REGARDED THE ANIMAL FOR A TIME WITH PLEASURE SET IT FREE NO LONGER UNDER HERCULES MANAGEMENT THE OX BECAME WILD AGAIN WANDERED THROUGH ALL LACONIA AND ARCADIA
NOW EURYSTHEUS WATCHED WITH ANXIETY THE RISING FAME OF HIS YOUNG RELATIVE AND CALLED HIS SUBJECT TO HIM DEMANDING THAT HE CARRY THROUGH CERTAIN GREAT TASKS OR LABORS WHEN HERCULES DID NOT IMMEDIATELY OBEY
THE MAGICIAN WAS SO TERRIFIED AND SUFFERED SUCH ANGUISH IN THE CLUTCHES OF THE EVIL ONE THAT IN A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS CHANGED INTO AN OLD MAN BUT HE DID NOT LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AT LAST SO HIGH WERE THEY
HIS REQUEST WAS NOT GRANTED AND HELGE DISMISSED HIM CONTEMPTUOUSLY IN A RAGE AT THE INSULT FRITHIOF LIFTED HIS SWORD
THAT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE WAS THE MOST CELEBRATED DOCTOR IN ALL POLAND BUT TWARDOWSKI WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS HE CRAVED GREATER AND STILL GREATER POWER AT LAST ONE DAY AS HE WAS READING
LANDING HE WRAPPED HIMSELF IN AN OLD CLOAK AND APPROACHED THE COURT HE FOUND A SEAT ON A BENCH NEAR THE DOOR AS BEGGARS USUALLY DID
HIS BROTHER CENTAURS HAD FLED FOR PROTECTION BUT HERCULES STILL CONTINUED SHOOTING AND SENT AN ARROW THROUGH THE ARM OF AN OLD CENTAUR WHICH UNHAPPILY WENT QUITE THROUGH AND FELL ON CHIRON'S KNEE PIERCING THE FLESH
AND TWARDOWSKI RETURNED HOME FOR OVER A YEAR HE PORED INCESSANTLY OVER HIS BOOKS OF MAGIC UNTIL AT LAST HE FOUND A FORMULA FOR WARDING OFF DEATH
WHICH THE KINGS OF SOGN AND THEIR SISTER INGEBORG AMONG MANY OTHER GUESTS ATTENDED FRITHIOF AND INGEBORG WERE MUCH TOGETHER AND FRITHIOF WAS VERY HAPPY TO LEARN THAT INGEBORG RETURNED HIS AFFECTION
AND FOUND NOT THE BODY OF TWARDOWSKI BUT THAT OF A CHILD WHO LAY SLEEPING IN A BED OF FRAGRANT VIOLETS THE CHILD IS LIKE TWARDOWSKI
TO OFFER TO HIM WHATEVER ANIMAL SHOULD FIRST COME UP OUT OF THE WATER
WHEN BOTH SAW THE FRIENDLY FORM OF HERCULES THEY STRETCHED BESEECHING HANDS TOWARDS HIM TREMBLING WITH THE HOPE THAT THROUGH HIS STRENGTH THEY MIGHT AGAIN REACH THE UPPER WORLD HERCULES GRASPED THESEUS BY THE HAND FREED HIM FROM HIS CHAINS AND RAISED HIM FROM THE GROUND
WITHOUT FIRE WITHOUT FOOD AND WITH NO SHELTER BUT MISERABLE CAVES WITH FIRE THEY COULD AT LEAST WARM THEIR BODIES AND COOK THEIR FOOD PROMETHEUS THOUGHT AND LATER THEY COULD MAKE TOOLS AND BUILD HOUSES FOR THEMSELVES
THEN HE SENT VULCAN TO BIND HIM WITH IRON CHAINS MAKING ARMS AND FEET FAST TO THE ROCKS VULCAN WAS SORRY FOR PROMETHEUS BUT DARED NOT DISOBEY SO THE FRIEND OF MAN LAY
SO SHE CAUSED TO SPRING FORTH ON THE WESTERN BORDERS OF THE GREAT WORLD SEA A MANY BRANCHED TREE FULL OF GOLDEN APPLES FOUR MAIDENS CALLED THE HESPERIDES DAUGHTERS OF NIGHT WERE THE GUARDIANS OF THIS SACRED GARDEN AND WITH THEM WATCHED THE HUNDRED HEADED DRAGON
AS IT HAPPENED THE CASK OF WINE HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE CENTAURS BY BACCHUS THE GOD OF WINE WITH THE COMMAND THAT THEY SHOULD NOT OPEN IT UNTIL AFTER FOUR CENTURIES HERCULES SHOULD APPEAR IN THEIR MIDST PHOLUS WENT TO THE CELLAR
FELL AND WAS SOON DEAD
FRITHIOF WAS ENTRUSTED TO THE CARE OF HILDING HIS FOSTER FATHER AND IN HIS CARE ALSO WERE HALFDAN AND HELGE KING
AFTER HE HAD CALLED THE SON OF AUGEAS TO WITNESS THE AGREEMENT TORE THE FOUNDATIONS AWAY FROM ONE SIDE OF THE STABLES DIRECTED TO IT BY MEANS OF A CANAL THE STREAMS OF ALPHEUS AND PENEUS THAT FLOWED NEAR BY AND LET THE WATERS CARRY AWAY THE FILTH THROUGH ANOTHER OPENING
TO SIGURD RING IN A RAGE HE BADE HIS MEN DESTROY ALL THE VESSELS IN THE HARBOR
GREAT WAS HIS GRIEF WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR HER TO SAIL AWAY NOT LONG HAD SHE BEEN GONE HOWEVER
ATLAS FOUND THIS NEW DEMAND REASONABLE AND CONSENTED TO TAKE OVER THE BURDEN AGAIN FOR A FEW MINUTES BUT THE DECEIVER WAS AT LAST DECEIVED AND HERCULES PICKED UP THE APPLES FROM THE GROUND AND SET OUT ON HIS WAY BACK HE CARRIED THE APPLES TO EURYSTHEUS
WHEN THE WORK WAS DONE HE CARRIED IT TO OLYMPUS JUPITER CALLED THE OTHER GODS TOGETHER BIDDING THEM GIVE HER EACH A GIFT ONE BESTOWED UPON HER BEAUTY ANOTHER KINDNESS ANOTHER SKILL ANOTHER CURIOSITY AND SO ON
AMONG THE IMMORTAL GODS HEREUPON HERCULES FELL INTO DEEP TROUBLE TO SERVE A MAN OF LESS IMPORTANCE THAN HIMSELF HURT HIS DIGNITY AND SELF ESTEEM BUT JUPITER WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIS COMPLAINTS THE FIRST LABOR
CALLED FRITHIOF TO HIM AND BADE HIM REMEMBER THAT HE WAS ONLY A HUMBLE SUBJECT AND COULD NEVER HOPE TO WED INGEBORG THE KING'S ONLY DAUGHTER DESCENDED FROM THE GREAT GOD ODIN
THE HERO WHO SAW HIM COMING LONG BEFORE HE WAS NEAR TOOK REFUGE IN A THICKET AND WAITED UNTIL THE LION APPROACHED THEN WITH HIS ARROW HE SHOT HIM IN THE SIDE BUT THE SHOT DID NOT PIERCE HIS FLESH INSTEAD IT FLEW BACK AS IF IT HAD STRUCK STONE
WITHOUT STOOPING TO ANYTHING UNWORTHY OF AN IMMORTAL
DELIGHTED AT THE TEMPEST THEY HAD STIRRED UP SPEAKING TO HIS GOOD SHIP WHICH COULD BOTH HEAR AND OBEY HE BADE IT RUN DOWN THE WHALE AND THE WITCHES
HERCULES SET OUT WITH HIGH COURAGE FOR THIS FIGHT
HE BROKE OFF ONE AND SEEING THAT ITS HOLLOW STALK WAS FILLED WITH A DRY SOFT PITH EXCLAIMED AT LAST IN THIS I CAN CARRY FIRE
IT SEEMS MORE ACCEPTABLE THAT ONLY CERTAIN AREAS ARE
THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
THAT NOTHING BUT THIS FALLING SUBSTANCE WAS VISIBLE IN THE SKY IT FELL IN FLAKES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME TWO INCHES SQUARE
ONE SMILES IN MONTANA IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FELL SNOWFLAKES FIFTEEN INCHES ACROSS AND EIGHT INCHES THICK MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW NINETEEN FIFTEEN SEVENTY THREE
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHIRLWIND AND VOLCANO EXPLANATIONS HAD TO BE ABANDONED BUT SO POWERFUL WAS THIS EXCLUSION HYPNOSIS SENTENCE OF DAMNATION OR THIS ATTEMPT AT POSITIVENESS
THAT HAVE FALLEN WITH A DISTRIBUTION NARROWER THAN IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A WHIRLWIND THAT HAVE FALLEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME UPON THE SAME NARROW AREA OF LAND THESE THREE FACTORS INDICATE SOMEWHERE NOT FAR ALOFT
THAT ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY TAKEN BEFORE A MAGISTRATE A FALL OCCURRED FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NEAR FERIDPOOR INDIA OF MANY FISHES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME WHOLE AND FRESH AND OTHERS MUTILATED AND PUTREFYING
FALL OF FISHES JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN HOLLAND ANTS AUGUST FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE STRASBOURG LITTLE TOADS AUGUST SECOND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE SAVOY
IF HOSTS OF LIVING FROGS HAVE COME HERE FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE EVERY LIVING THING UPON THIS EARTH MAY ANCESTRALLY HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE I FIND THAT I HAVE ANOTHER NOTE UPON A SPECIFIC HURRICANE
THE FLAKE FORMATION IS INTERESTING LATER WE SHALL THINK OF IT AS SIGNIFYING PRESSURE SOMEWHERE IT WAS A THICK SHOWER ON THE GROUND ON TREES ON FENCES BUT IT WAS NARROWLY LOCALIZED
ROSS SHIRE SCOTLAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
IF THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD SEEM TO COMBINE AGAINST YOU IT IS ONLY UNREAL COMBINATION OR INTERMEDIATENESS TO UNITY AND DISUNITY EVERY RESISTANCE IS ITSELF DIVIDED INTO PARTS RESISTING ONE ANOTHER THE SIMPLEST STRATEGY SEEMS TO BE
AND UNREALNESS IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO A COMMITTEE OF WHOM LAVOISIER WAS A MEMBER WAS APPOINTED BY THE FRENCH ACADEMY TO INVESTIGATE A REPORT THAT A STONE HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY AT LUCE FRANCE
FELL A SMALL PIECE OF ALABASTER THAT AT BOVINA EIGHT MILES FROM VICKSBURG FELL A GOPHER TURTLE THEY FELL IN A HAILSTORM THIS ITEM WAS WIDELY COPIED AT THE TIME FOR INSTANCE NATURE
BUT MAY AFTER A WHILE BE SHAKEN DOWN BY STORMS
ATTEMPTS TO PRESERVE THE SYSTEM THAT SMALL FROGS AND TOADS FOR INSTANCE NEVER HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY BUT WERE ON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE OR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH FALLS UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
IS PROFESSOR GRAVES ACCOUNT COMMUNICATED BY PROFESSOR DEWEY THAT UPON THE EVENING OF AUGUST THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A LIGHT WAS SEEN IN AMHERST A FALLING OBJECT SOUND
RATHER STRICTLY LOCALIZED OR IN A SPACE OF TWO BLOCKS AND AFTER A VIOLENT STORM IN WHICH THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS SNAKES WERE FOUND THEY WERE CRAWLING ON SIDEWALKS IN YARDS AND IN STREETS AND IN MASSES
AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
AFTER A HEAVY RAINFALL WE ARE NOT TOLD OF NOSTOC THIS TIME IT IS SAID THAT THE OBJECT CONTAINED NUMEROUS EGGS
OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
MAY SIXTEENTH OR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS THE DATE GIVEN IN THE JOURNAL
THAT SMALL SNAILS OF A LAND SPECIES HAD FALLEN NEAR REDRUTH CORNWALL JULY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX DURING A HEAVY THUNDERSTORM ROADS AND FIELDS STREWN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY WERE GATHERED UP BY THE HATFUL
GREEN SCIENCE GOSSIP
DATE NOT GIVEN BUT I HAVE SEEN IT RECORDED SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BEST KNOWN FALL OF FISHES FROM THE SKY IS THAT WHICH OCCURRED AT MOUNTAIN ASH
IN THE LONDON TIMES JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF A SHOWER OF TWIGS AND LEAVES AND TINY TOADS IN A STORM UPON THE SLOPES OF THE APENNINES THESE MAY HAVE BEEN THE EJECTAMENTA OF A WHIRLWIND I ADD HOWEVER
REMAIN AND DRY OR EVEN PUTREFY THEN SOMETIMES FALLING BY ATMOSPHERIC DISLODGMENT AFTER A TREMENDOUS DELUGE OF RAIN ONE OF THE HEAVIEST FALLS ON RECORD
IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THEY WERE SHOVELED UP IT IS SAID THAT THE SNAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A LOCAL SPECIES
NEVER BOTHER TO FIGHT A THING SET ITS OWN PARTS FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER WE ARE MERGING AWAY FROM CARNAL TO GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE AND HERE THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF INSTANCES OR REPORTS OF INSTANCES
THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
SOME OF THE FISH WERE FRESH BUT OTHERS WERE ROTTEN AND WITHOUT HEADS AMONG THE NUMBER WHICH I GOT FIVE WERE FRESH AND THE REST STINKING AND HEADLESS THEY REMIND US OF HIS GRACE'S OBSERVATION OF SOME PAGES BACK
THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ANOTHER FALL OF FISHES OCCURRED UPON THIS SAME NARROW STRIP OF LAND EVEN ARGUING THAT A WHIRLWIND MAY STAND STILL AXIALLY IT DISCHARGES TANGENTIALLY WHEREVER THE FISHES CAME FROM IT DOES NOT SEEM THINKABLE
THE FALL OF A THOUSAND TONS OF BUTTER JET BLACK SNOW PINK SNOW BLUE HAILSTONES HAILSTONES FLAVORED LIKE ORANGES PUNK AND SILK AND CHARCOAL
THAT'S THE EXPLANATION THAT THE SCIENTISTS GAVE
OR NOTHING MORE REASONABLE OR SCIENTIFIC OR LOGICAL THAN THAT COULD BE SAID UPON ANY SUBJECT THE ONLY TROUBLE IS THE UNIVERSAL TROUBLE THAT THE MAJOR PREMISE IS NOT REAL OR IS INTERMEDIATE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN REALNESS
SO HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT SOMETHING IS NOT SOMETHING ELSE WHEN NEITHER IS SOMETHING ELSE SOME OTHER THING THERE'S NOTHING TO PROVE THIS IS ONE OF THE PROFUNDITIES THAT WE ADVERTISED IN ADVANCE
SMALL FROGS FELL AT WIGAN ENGLAND NATURE EIGHTY SEVEN TEN THAT JUNE TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN ELEVEN AT ETON BUCKS ENGLAND THE GROUND WAS FOUND COVERED WITH MASSES OF JELLY THE SIZE OF PEAS
IT IS SAID THAT THESE PHENOMENA WERE CAUSED BY PARTICLES OF VOLCANIC DUST THAT WERE CAST HIGH IN THE AIR BY KRAKATOA THIS IS THE EXPLANATION THAT WAS AGREED UPON IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT FOR SEVEN YEARS THE ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA CONTINUED
FALL OF ANTS CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SOME WERE WINGLESS
MISTER JENYNS CONCEIVES OF A LARGE POOL IN WHICH WERE MANY OF THESE SPHERICAL MASSES OF THE POOL DRYING UP AND CONCENTRATING ALL IN A SMALL AREA OF A WHIRLWIND THEN SCOOPING ALL UP TOGETHER
VICAR OF ABEDARE ASSERTING THAT THE FALL HAD OCCURRED CHIEFLY UPON THE PROPERTY OF MISTER NIXON OF MOUNTAIN ASH
OF ALL INCREDIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM I GIVE FIRST PLACE TO A NOTION OF A WHIRLWIND POUNCING UPON A REGION
SAYS THAT ALL OUR DATA IN THIS RESPECT MUST BE

WHERE HE GETS OFF THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN OUR CASE BY AN ARGUMENT CONCERNING A SPEECH IN THE PLAY WHERE ONE OF THE CHARACTERS REMARKS I PROPOSE TO SEND A MENTAL MESSAGE TO ELIZA THIS SOUNDS WE CONTEND

WE MET WITH BANDAGED EYES WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT JOURNEYS THEY HAD BEEN ON WHAT WINDING ROADS THEIR SPIRITS HAD TRAVELLED WHAT INGENIOUS SHIFTS THEY HAD DEVISED TO CIRCUMVENT THE WALLS AND BARRIERS OF THE WORLD
WE AWOKE TO REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED WE HAD WITHOUT KNOWING IT GAINED A NEW FRIEND IN SOME CURIOUS WAY THE UNSEEN BORDER LINE HAD BEEN PASSED WE HAD REACHED THE FINAL CULMINATION

ONE DOES NOT ARGUE FOR THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS NOT ARGUABLE ONE SHRUGS AFTER ALL WHAT HUMAN GESTURE MORE ELOQUENT OR MORE SATISFYING TO THE PERFORMER THAN THE SHRUG
THE READING OF THIS DELIGHTFUL BOOK HAS TAKEN US BACK INTO THE VERY PANG AND FELICITY OF OUR FIRST GREAT PASSION OUR IDOLATRY IF YOU WILL WHICH WE ARE PROUD HERE AND NOW TO RE AVOW
BUT THE LOCAL PRIDE OF THE SMALL TOWN IS A GENIAL THING IT MAY ALWAYS BE NOTED IN THE BARBER SHOPS THE SMALL TOWN BARBER KNOWS HIS CUSTOMERS
ALL THAT ONE NEEDS TO DO TO THAT IS TO WRITE OVER IT THE CAPTION SO DO WE ALL AND PASS ON TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH THE MORE A COLYUMIST IS OUT
PERHAPS SOME DAY THE GOVERNMENT WILL CROWN A COLYUMIST LAUREATE SOME MAJESTIC SAGE WITH ANCIENT PATIENT BLUE EYES AND A SNOWY BEARD NOBLY STAINED WITH NICOTINE WHOSE UTTERANCES WILL BE HEEDED WITH SHUDDERING RESPECT
IN AN ALMOST DISBELIEVED GLIMPSE OF SUBLIMITY AND THE GOLDEN LIGHTNING OF THE TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH PINNACLE
THE MILLION DOLLAR DOLL IN PARIS IS ALSO IN TOWN OR HARRY BULGER'S GIRLY SHOW WILL BE THERE THE FOLLOWING EVENING OR MACK SENNETT'S BATHING BEAUTIES IN PERSON THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF THEY FALL FOR
THEIR COMMENTS WERE NOTABLE FOR WISDOM AND SAGACITY THE WAITER OVERHEARING SHREDS OF THEIR DISCOURSE MADE A PRIVATE NOTATION TO THE EFFECT THAT THESE
BY A WEEK OF ONE NIGHT STANDS THEATRICAL BILLBOARDS FOR INSTANCE WE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IN A VAGUE KIND OF WAY THAT THEY WERE A DEFACEMENT TO A TOWN AND CLUTTERED UP BLANK SPACES
HE WAS THUS AT EVERY MOMENT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE DEADLY POISON WITH WHICH HE COULD HAVE FULLY SATISFIED HIS CRAVING IT WAS A MORAL VICTORY WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH HE WENT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
THAT I WAS NOT TO APPLY HYPNOTISM HE WAS ABSOLUTELY AVERSE TO THE USE OF HYPNOTISM IN HIS OWN CASE BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT TO BE HYPNOTIZED WOULD MEAN FOR HIM A CERTAIN DISPOSITION TO FALL INTO HYPNOTIC SLEEP
COMPLETE REST FOR INSTANCE FOR A HARD BRAIN WORKER HARDLY OUGHT TO BE RECOMMENDED UNLESS A HIGH DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION HAS COME ON IF ROUTINE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE TO BE ADMITTED AT ALL
AND IN THAT MOMENT THE VISUAL IMAGE OF THE WOMAN RAISING A GLASS OF POISON TO HER MOUTH FLASHED INTO HIS MIND AND THUS BECAME ALMOST A PART OF THE SHOCK FROM THAT TIME ON
STRENUOSITY MUST NOT MEAN AN EXTERNAL RUSH WITH THE GESTURES OF OVERBUSY EXCITEMENT BUT CERTAINLY THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAZY LIFE IS WRETCHED PSYCHOTHERAPY AS LONG AS NO SERIOUS ILLNESS IS IN QUESTION
IN ANY CASE HE HAD AN AVERSION TO IT AND ASKED FOR OTHER MEANS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT SEEMED TO ME THE MOST LOGICAL CONCLUSION THAT THE COUNTER IDEA WITH ITS ANTAGONISTIC REACTIONS
BUT IF WE WERE TO STRIKE OUT ALL SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCES FROM SOCIAL LIFE WE SHOULD GIVE UP SOCIAL LIFE ITSELF SUGGESTION IS GIVEN WHEREVER MEN COME IN CONTACT IN ITSELF IT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD THE GOOD RESOLUTION AND THE BAD ONE CAN BE SUGGESTED
WHICH ANY MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE CASES WOULD DEMAND AND FROM ALL RESULTS OF FURTHER EXAMINATION AND OTHER PARTICULARS AS A MATTER OF COURSE I EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING THE PATIENT
IN IMITATING THAT WHICH OTHERS CAN DO JUST AS WELL OR BETTER LOSES THE POWER TO DO THAT WHICH THE CHURCH ALONE CAN DO THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THEREFORE PRACTICALLY IN EVERY WAY THE SAME FROM WHATEVER STARTING POINT WE MAY COME WE ARE LED TO THE CONVICTION
WHEREVER A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OWN WILL FORCE AND ATTENTION CAN BE EXPECTED TO OVERCOME THE ANTAGONISTIC INFLUENCE THERE ARTIFICIAL HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED EVERYTHING OUGHT TO BE LEFT IN THAT CASE TO SUGGESTIONS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS
WITH A FULL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT IS ABSURD AND YET SHE CANNOT SUPPRESS IT I BEGAN AT ONCE TO TRY TO FIND THE ORIGIN OF HER QUEER OBSESSION AFTER SOME EFFORTS TO PIERCE INTO HER MEMORIES
EVERY SUGGESTION HAS TO RELY ON THE EFFORTS AND STRUGGLES OF THE PATIENT HIMSELF AND ALL THAT THE PSYCHOTHERAPISTS CAN GIVE HIM IS HELP IN HIS OWN MORAL FIGHT HIS OWN WILL IS PRESUPPOSITION FOR BEING HYPNOTIZED
THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE IDEA BECAME MORE AND MORE EXASPERATING MADE LIFE A TORTURE ALMOST SUGGESTED DESPAIR EVEN FAINT THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE AND ESPECIALLY A GROWING FEAR THAT IT WAS A SYMPTOM OF THE BEGINNING OF INSANITY
EVEN TODAY MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT A NEURASTHENIC OR A PSYCHASTHENIC OR A HYSTERIC DISTURBANCE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY BE IN ITS BEGINNING
WHOLE PAMPHLETS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH ELABORATION OF SUCH INSANE MISINTERPRETATIONS AND REQUESTS TO LEGISLATURES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THAT SPIRIT BUT THE PHYSICIAN RECOGNIZES EASILY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ARGUMENTATION THE WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA OF THE MENTAL DISEASE
AFTER STUDYING THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES WE HAVE SKETCHED THE WHOLE FIELD OF DISTURBANCES IN WHICH PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE MIGHT BE POSSIBLE AND ALL THE METHODS AVAILABLE IT SEEMS NATURAL THAT OUR NEXT STEP
THERE WERE NO OTHER NERVOUS SYMPTOMS AND WITH HIS MOST ACUTE ANALYSIS HE DID NOT FIND THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF EMOTION ANY LONGER WHEN THE SYMPTOMS REACHED A POINT AT WHICH
DRAW THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF A NATURALISTIC VIEW OF THE MIND WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER OR NOT SERIOUS INTERESTS IN THE PURPOSIVE SPHERE ARE INJURED IF THERE IS MORAL CRITICISM AGAINST SUGGESTIVE THERAPY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER IT
NO THEORY OF THE WORLD AND OF GOD OUGHT TO GAIN AUTHORITY OVER THE MIND FROM SUCH AN EXTERNAL MOTIVE AS A BELIEF IN ITS CURATIVE EFFECTS FREEST FROM SUCH IMPLICATIONS IS CERTAINLY THE HYPNOTIC METHOD OF THE PHYSICIAN
BY PHYSICAL AGENCIES WE SAW THAT FOR US NOTHING ELSE CAN BE DESIRABLE BUT TO SHOW THE WAY IN WHICH THE VARIOUS SYMPTOMS WHICH SUGGEST MENTAL TREATMENT OCCUR
THAT FOR A FIRST SURVEY WE MIGHT SEPARATE THE MENTAL FROM THE BODILY SYMPTOMS AND GROUP THE MENTAL ONES WITH REFERENCE TO THE PREDOMINANCE OF IDEATIONAL EMOTIONAL AND VOLITIONAL FACTORS
MY AIM WAS TO REMOVE THIS CAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROUGHT LITTLE IMPROVEMENT SIMPLY TO SUPPRESS THE FREAK IDEA AS LONG AS THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL SOURCE WAS ACTIVE ON THE OTHER HAND
BUT BECAUSE IT IS IN ERROR AS TO THE FACTS SUCH CRITICS ARE FULLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARTLING RESULTS WHICH ARE REACHED THEY DO NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO EXAMINE THE LONG AND DIFFICULT WAY WHICH HAS HAD TO BE TRAVERSED WITH PATIENCE AND ENERGY
A MAN OF MATURE AGE WELL EDUCATED WELL BUILT AND IN EVERY RESPECT IN GOOD HEALTH WITHOUT NERVOUS HISTORY AND WITHOUT OTHER NERVOUS SYMPTOMS
THE INTELLECTUAL WORKER OUGHT TO DECREASE HIS WORK THE OVERBUSY SOCIETY WOMAN OUGHT TO STAY IN BED ONE DAY IN THE WEEK THE MAN IN THE MIDST OF THE RUSH OF LIFE OUGHT TO CUT DOWN HIS OBLIGATIONS
THREE DOSES OF THREE GRAINS A DAY I TOOK MY HYPODERMIC AS DIRECTED BUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY I LAY ON THE BED TOO EXHAUSTED TO GET UP EVEN TO GET AROUND THE ROOM AND I COULD NOT EAT
AND AS I ANTICIPATED THAT THE VISUAL SENSATIONS WOULD BE MORE FORCEFUL THAN THE TACTUAL ONES I TOLD HIM TO LOOK STRAIGHT AT HIS OWN WRISTS FOR TEN MINUTES THREE TIMES A DAY AFTER WAKING
IN THE FORM OF GOOD EXAMPLE AND PERSUASIONS AUTHORITY AND DISCIPLINE LOVE AND SYMPATHY THAT HOLDS TRUE EVEN FOR VERY SLIGHT ABNORMALITIES WHICH SEEM STILL WITHIN THE LIMITS WHERE THE OWN ENERGIES CAN BRING ABOUT THE CURE FOR INSTANCE
THIS THOUGHT KEEPS HER AWAY FROM COMPANY AND THE EFFECT OF ITS EMBARRASSING OCCURRENCE DEPRESSES HER BUT SHE IS SURE THAT THE THOUGHT ITSELF DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY EMOTION IT IS A MERE THINKING OF IT
CRIMINAL ON SOME OTHER OBJECTIONS WHICH INTEREST THE COMMUNITY AS SUCH WE HAD TO TOUCH BEFORE AND THERE IS NO NEED OF RETURNING TO THEM WITH ANY FULLNESS OF ARGUMENT WE SPOKE OF THE DANGER WHICH THE MENTAL CURES CARRY WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE BASED ON ANY PARTICULAR CREED
TO BE SURE WHILE NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED AGAINST HIS WILL MANY A PERSON IS LIABLE TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHERS AND THUS TO CARRY OUT THE WISHES OF OTHERS ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT WILLING THAT THE OTHER MIND INTERFERE WITH THE INTERPLAY OF THE OWN MOTIVES
THE PLACE OF THE DISTURBANCE WAS THE WRISTS THE STARTING POINT WAS A DEFINITE EXPERIENCE ON AN UNUSUALLY HOT SUMMER DAY THE PHYSICIAN HAD LISTENED FOR A LONG TIME TO THE COMPLAINTS OF A FEMALE PATIENT
IS TOO MUCH OVERSHADOWED BY THE DEEP PITY AND SYMPATHY WITH THEIR SUFFERING AND CRAVING DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF SUCCESSIVE TREATMENTS TO MAKE A MAN FIGHT WHERE DESPAIR IS INEVITABLE AND WHERE THE ENEMY IS NECESSARILY STRONGER THAN HIS OWN POWERS CAN CERTAINLY NOT BE THE MORAL DEMAND
HE CAME TO ME WITH THE DIRECT REQUEST AS A LAST RESORT TO TRY HYPNOTIC TREATMENT I FOUND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE AND HIS PHYSICIAN HAD CONSTANTLY SPOKEN OF VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS
THAT THE PHYSICIAN ALONE IS CALLED TO ADMINISTER PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC WORK BUT THAT HE NEEDS A THOROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING BESIDES HIS MEDICAL ONE BUT THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT ONLY A NEGATIVE ONE
WHILE THE ADVICE OF THE PHYSICIAN OUGHT THUS TO EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS WHICH WORK NOT TOWARDS REST BUT TOWARD A HARMONIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY WE MUST NOT FORGET SOME ESSENTIAL NEGATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS
FOR A DEEP PHYSIOLOGICAL BRAIN EXCITEMENT WHICH HAD IRRADIATED TOWARDS THE IDEAS OF HER PERSONALITY IT HAD STIRRED UP THERE ASSOCIATIONS WHICH KEPT THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTER
PSYCHOTHERAPY HAS ITS RIGHT THE FEEBLE MINDED AND THE RETARDED CHILD THE PERVERSE CHILD AND THE EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE CHILD BELONG UNDER THE CARE OF THE PHYSICIAN
THEY SERIOUSLY INTERFERED WITH HIS COMFORT HE ASKED ME FOR PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT UNDER THE CONDITION
MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER FIELD OF MEDICINE THE PHYSICIAN HIMSELF HAS TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE FAR BEYOND THE OFFICE HOURS AND THE STRICTLY MEDICAL RELATIONS AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE IN WHICH THE TREATMENT MIGHT NOT PROFIT BY THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE
TO ENJOY A LANDSCAPE OUGHT TO BE NOT MERELY A NEGATIVE REST FOR THE MAN OF THE OFFICE BUILDING AND GOOD LITERATURE OR MUSIC ABSORBS THE MENTAL ENERGIES AND HARMONIZES THEM
TO PATRIOTISM AND RELIGION INCREASES THE DEGREE OF SUGGESTIBILITY THAT IS THE GLORY OF LIFE THAT THE SUGGESTIVE POWER MAY BELONG TO MORAL VALUES INSTEAD OF MERE PLEASURES BUT IT IS NOT THE AIM OF LIFE TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY SUGGESTION
THAT IS INDEED ONE OF THE CENTRAL DANGERS OF ALL NON MEDICAL SUGGESTIVE CURES THAT WHILE ANY BELIEF MAY CURE THROUGH THE MERE EMOTIONAL POWER OF THE ACT OF BELIEVING THE CONTENT OF THE BELIEF GAINS AN UNDESERVED APPEARANCE OF TRUTH
THE TRAVELLER TOOK A WESTERLY DIRECTION WHEN HE LEFT SINDAFOU AND CROSSING THE KINGDOM OF GAINDU HE MUST HAVE COME TO LI KIANG FOO THE CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY THAT IS NOW CALLED TSI MONG
AND THE NUMBER OF AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS WAS GREATLY REDUCED BY THE CHANGE FROM THENCE AROSE GENERAL DISTRESS AND ALSO SUCH A SURPLUSSAGE OF POPULATION AS WAS FAST BECOMING A MATTER OF ANXIOUS CONCERN
THIS WAS THE LAST TOWN IN THE PROVINCE OF MANGI THAT RESISTED THE DOMINION OF KUBLAI KHAN HE BESIEGED IT FOR THREE YEARS AND HE OWED HIS TAKING IT AT LAST TO THE HELP OF THE THREE POLOS
THE ACCOUNT WHICH RALEIGH GIVES OF HIS CAMPAIGN IS SO FABULOUS WITH THE COOLNESS OF A GASCON TRANSPORTED TO THE BANKS OF THE THAMES
HE AFTERWARDS RAVAGED PLUNDERED OR BURNT THE TOWNS OF PARACA CINCHA PISCA AND PAITA AND DEVASTATED THE ISLAND OF PUNA
AND OBTAINED CONSIDERABLE SPOIL UNFORTUNATELY THESE ENTERPRISES WERE NOT CARRIED OUT WITHOUT MUCH CRUELTY AND MANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH WOULD MAKE MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY BLUSH
IN THIS VERY SECURE HARBOUR THE SHIPS WERE DRAWN UP ON SHORE TO BE REPAIRED DURING HIS STAY AT THIS PLACE CAVENDISH HAD SOME SKIRMISHES WITH THE PATAGONIANS MEN OF GIGANTIC SIZE AND HAVING FEET EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG
AFTER HAVING BROUGHT HIS MISSION TO INDO CHINA TO A SATISFACTORY TERMINATION IT WAS PROBABLY AT THIS TIME THAT THE TRAVELLER WAS FIRST ENTRUSTED BY THE EMPEROR WITH ANOTHER MISSION TO THE SOUTH EAST OF CHINA
PROBABLY THE TOWN OF TI CHOO AND AT SIX DAYS JOURNEY FROM THENCE HE CAME TO CONDINFOO THE PRESENT CITY OF TSI NAN THE CAPITAL OF THE PROVINCE OF SHAN TUNG THE BIRTHPLACE OF CONFUCIUS
AS WEARING CLOTHES AND POSSESSING GREAT RICHES ESPECIALLY IN PLATES OF GOLD FINALLY HE SPOKE TO HIM OF A MOUNTAIN OF PURE GOLD RALEIGH RELATES THAT HE WISHED TO APPROACH THIS MOUNTAIN BUT SAD MISCHANCE IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT HALF SUBMERGED
WITH TWO YACHTS THE EENDRACHT AND ESPERANCE
THERE REMAINED ONLY A SUM SUFFICIENT FOR THE FITTING OUT OF A THIRD AND AS IT PROVED A LAST EXPEDITION CAVENDISH STARTED ON THE SIXTH AUGUST FIFTEEN NINETY ONE WITH FIVE VESSELS BUT A STORM ON THE COAST OF PATAGONIA SCATTERED THE FLOTILLA
HE HAD NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND INFANTS BROUGHT UP AT THE ROYAL CHARGE FOR IT WAS THE CUSTOM IN THESE PROVINCES WHEN A POOR WOMAN COULD NOT BRING UP A CHILD HERSELF TO CAST IT AWAY AS SOON AS IT WAS BORN TO DIE
IT IS A SHORT TIME AFTER HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND THAT HE FALLS INTO DISGRACE WITH HIS ROYAL MISTRESS
MARCO POLO RETRACED HIS STEPS THAT HE MIGHT VISIT SOME OF THE TOWNS ON THE SEA COAST HE VISITED KUI KIANG ON THE RIVER KIANG WHICH IS VERY BROAD HERE
CALLED CANTON AMONGST US AND THE CHIEF TOWN OF THE PROVINCE
AFTER AN ABSENCE OF THREE YEARS ALL BUT A FEW DAYS THE RECEPTION WHICH AWAITED HIM IN ENGLAND WAS AT FIRST EXTREMELY COLD HIS HAVING FALLEN BY SURPRISE BOTH UPON SPANISH TOWNS AND SHIPS
THE DUTCHMEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR PILOT TOSS AT RANDOM UPON THE OCEAN
DE NOORT HEARING THAT A SQUADRON COMMANDED BY THE BROTHER OF THE VICEROY DON LUIS DE VELASCO HAD BEEN SENT IN PURSUIT OF HIM JUDGED IT TIME TO MAKE FOR THE LADRONE ISLANDS
THEN THEY MADE A LONG DISCOURSE AFTER THE MANNER OF A HARANGUE AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THEY LAID ASIDE THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS IN THAT PLACE AND APPROACHED US TO OFFER THEIR PRESENTS THE FIRST TIME THEY CAME THEIR WOMEN REMAINED IN THE SAME PLACE
AND EACH PART HAD A KING OF ITS OWN BEFORE KUBLAI KHAN TOOK POSSESSION OF THE TOWN THE GREAT RIVER KIANG RAN THROUGH THE TOWN IT CONTAINED LARGE QUANTITIES OF FISH
HERE WAS TO BE SEEN ALSO THE PALACE OF THE MANGI SOVEREIGNS SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL GARDENS LAKES AND FOUNTAINS THE PALACE ITSELF CONTAINING MORE THAN A THOUSAND ROOMS

DRESSED IN THEIR STATE COSTUMES AFTER AN INTERCHANGE OF CIVILITIES AND PRESENTS THE ENGLISH RECEIVED SOME RICE SUGAR CANES FOWLS FIGO
UNICORNS AND OTHER WILD ANIMALS HE CAME TO THE GREAT CITY OF MIEN THAT IS TO SAY TO THAT PART OF UPPER BURMAH OF WHICH THE PRESENT CAPITAL OF RECENT ERECTION IS CALLED AMARAPURA THIS CITY OF MIEN
WHICH SEEMS TO CORRESPOND TO THE MODERN TOWN OF LIN TSIN
AND THE PRIVATIONS OF ALL KINDS WHICH HE UNDERWENT AND WHICH HAD DECIMATED HIS CREW FORCED HIM TO RETURN NORTHWARDS ALONG THE COAST OF BRAZIL WHERE THE PORTUGUESE OPPOSED EVERY ATTEMPT AT LANDING HE WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO PUT TO SEA AGAIN WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO REVICTUAL
AMONG ALL THOSE WHO TOOK EXAMPLE BY DRAKE THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THOMAS CAVENDISH OR CANDISH CAVENDISH JOINED THE ENGLISH MARINE SERVICE AT A VERY EARLY AGE AND PASSED A MOST STORMY YOUTH
WITH TWO DUTCH SHIPS UNDER THE COMMAND OF SEBALD DE WEERDT WHO HAD WINTERED NOT FAR FROM THE BAY OF MAURITIUS AND BY THE ABANDONING OF VICE ADMIRAL CLAAZ WHO AS IT WOULD APPEAR HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES GUILTY OF INSUBORDINATION
IN EIGHT DAYS HE REACHED THE FINE CITY OF QUANGIANFOO THE ANCIENT CAPITAL OF THE TANG DYNASTY NOW CALLED SIGNANFOO AND THE CAPITAL OF SHENSI
AND WHO HAD TAUGHT HIS COUNTRYMEN THE WAY TO THE INDIES IT BEHOVES US WHILE EXTOLLING HIS QUALITIES AS A SAILOR
AND THE DESCRIPTION HERE GIVEN BY DRAKE OF THE SAVAGES WHOM HE MET DOES NOT AT ALL RESEMBLE THAT GIVEN BY PIGAFETTA OF THE PATAGONIANS OF PORT SAINT JULIAN IF THERE EXIST AS SEEMS NOW TO BE PROVED A RACE OF MEN OF GREAT STATURE
WHERE HE LAID IN A SUPPLY OF WATER HE AFTERWARDS ARRIVED AT SEAL BAY IN PATAGONIA WHERE HE TRADED WITH THE NATIVES AND KILLED A GREAT NUMBER OF PENGUINS AND SEA WOLVES FOR THE NOURISHMENT OF HIS CREW
ON THE MORROW SOME OF THE SAILORS WHO HAD LANDED WERE PRESENT AT A COUNCIL WHEN THE KING ARRIVED A RICH UMBRELLA OR PARASOL ALL EMBROIDERED IN GOLD WAS BORNE BEFORE HIM HE WAS DRESSED AFTER THE FASHION OF HIS COUNTRY BUT WITH EXTREME MAGNIFICENCE
THAT THE TRAVELLER SET OUT ON THE VARIOUS EXPEDITIONS WHICH ENABLED HIM TO SEE SO MUCH OF THE INLAND AND SEA COAST TOWNS FIRST THE TRAVELLER WENT WESTWARD TO NAN GHIN WHICH MUST NOT BE CONFOUNDED WITH NAN KIN OF THE PRESENT DAY
AND BY THAT MEANS MAY INCREASE THE INFLUENCE AND PROSPERITY OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY ALL THE MORE THOUGHTFUL MINDS IN ENGLAND WHO FOLLOW THE COURSE OF PUBLIC OPINION HAKLUYT THOMAS HARIOT CARLYLE PECKHAM AND THE BROTHERS GILBERT
THE FIRST CITY IN THE PROVINCE OF TCHANG SU
THIS EXPEDITION FITTED OUT BY THE MERCHANTS OF AMSTERDAM WITH THE CONCURRENCE AND AID OF THE STATES GENERAL OF HOLLAND HAD A DOUBLE PURPOSE AT ONCE COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY
RECRUITED HIMSELF AT SAINT HELENA AND ON THE NINTH SEPTEMBER FIFTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ANCHORED AT PLYMOUTH AFTER TWO YEARS OF SAILING PRIVATEERING AND FIGHTING AT THE END OF TWO YEARS AFTER HIS RETURN OF ALL THE GREAT FORTUNE WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT BACK WITH HIM
AND WHO HAD JUST ADDED PORTUGAL TO HIS POSSESSIONS HAD FORBIDDEN HIS SUBJECTS TO HAVE ANY COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE WITH THE REBELS OF THE LOW COUNTRIES IT WAS THUS A NECESSITY FOR HOLLAND IF SHE DID NOT WISH TO BE RUINED
THE FLAG SHIP STRUCK UPON A ROCK WITH SO MUCH VIOLENCE THAT HAD THE SEA BEEN A LITTLE ROUGHER SHE MUST HAVE BEEN LOST THERE WERE ALSO SOME BLOODY AND BARBAROUS EXECUTIONS OF MUTINOUS SAILORS NOTABLY THAT OF A POOR MAN
AND ARRIVED ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH NOVEMBER AT PORT DESIRE HE FOUND THERE AN IMMENSE QUANTITY OF DOG FISH VERY LARGE AND SO STRONG THAT FOUR MEN COULD WITH DIFFICULTY KILL THEM AND NUMBERS OF BIRDS WHICH HAVING NO WINGS COULD NOT FLY AND WHICH FED UPON FISH
WHEN MARCO POLO HAD BEEN AT CAMBALUC SOME TIME HE WAS SENT ON A MISSION THAT KEPT HIM ABSENT FROM THE CAPITAL FOR FOUR MONTHS TEN MILES SOUTHWARDS FROM CAMBALUC HE CROSSED THE FINE RIVER PE HO NOR
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO CAST ANCHOR IN PORT DESIRE WHERE THE CREW KILLED IN A FEW DAYS A QUANTITY OF DOG FISH AND SEA LIONS
BUT WHAT MOST REJOICED THE HEART OF DRAKE WAS TO LEARN THAT A GALLEON NAMED THE CAGAFUEGO VERY RICHLY LADEN WAS SAILING TOWARDS PARACA HE IMMEDIATELY WENT IN PURSUIT
HE LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR AND EXPRESSED HIS ADMIRATION OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE BUT THERE WAS NO SMILE ON HIS FACE TURNING ROUND HE SAW ME SITTING IN THE ADJOINING ROOM AND QUICKLY EXCLAIMED THAT YOU LIZZIE
HE RESOLVED TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO SUBDUE MY PROUD REBELLIOUS SPIRIT MADE THE ATTEMPT AND AGAIN FAILED WHEN HE TOLD ME WITH AN AIR OF PENITENCE THAT HE SHOULD NEVER STRIKE ME ANOTHER BLOW AND FAITHFULLY HE KEPT HIS WORD THESE REVOLTING SCENES CREATED A GREAT SENSATION AT THE TIME
A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE DEPARTED FROM WASHINGTON FOR THE SOUTH WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT I RECOGNIZED THE DRESS AS ONE THAT I HAD MADE FOR THE WIFE OF THE LATE CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT THERE WAS GREAT CHEERING AND EXCITEMENT AND I AT ONCE BECAME THE OBJECT OF THE DEEPEST CURIOSITY
I WANT TO HEAR OF THE FAMILY AT HOME VERY MUCH INDEED I REALLY BELIEVE YOU AND ALL THE FAMILY HAVE FORGOTTEN ME IF NOT I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF YOU SINCE YOU LEFT BOYTON IF IT WAS ONLY A LINE NEVERTHELESS
I HAD HEARD SO MUCH IN CURRENT AND MALICIOUS REPORT OF HER LOW LIFE OF HER IGNORANCE AND VULGARITY THAT I EXPECTED TO SEE HER EMBARRASSED ON THIS OCCASION REPORT I SOON SAW WAS WRONG
IT CUT THE SKIN RAISED GREAT WELTS AND THE WARM BLOOD TRICKLED DOWN MY BACK OH GOD I CAN FEEL THE TORTURE NOW THE TERRIBLE EXCRUCIATING AGONY OF THOSE MOMENTS I DID NOT SCREAM
AND I STOOD LIKE A STATUE WHILE THE KEEN LASH CUT DEEP INTO MY FLESH AS SOON AS I WAS RELEASED STUNNED WITH PAIN BRUISED AND BLEEDING I WENT HOME AND RUSHED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE PASTOR AND HIS WIFE WILDLY EXCLAIMING MASTER ROBERT
WE ARE JUST FROM THE WEST AND ARE POOR IF YOU DO NOT CHARGE TOO MUCH I SHALL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU ALL MY WORK I DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE ANY DIFFICULTY ABOUT CHARGES MISSUS LINCOLN MY TERMS ARE REASONABLE WELL
OH THE BABY IS ON THE FLOOR AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I SEIZED THE FIRE SHOVEL IN MY PERPLEXITY AND WAS TRYING TO SHOVEL UP MY TENDER CHARGE WHEN MY MISTRESS CALLED TO ME TO LET THE CHILD ALONE
I BOWED ASSENT THE DRESS MAKER THAT MISSUS MC CLEAN RECOMMENDED YES MADAM VERY WELL I HAVE NOT TIME TO TALK TO YOU NOW BUT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU CALL AT THE WHITE HOUSE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING WHERE I SHALL THEN BE
WHEN I FIRST BEGAN TO REMEMBER AT LEAST I CANNOT NOW RECALL ANYTHING OCCURRING PREVIOUS TO THIS PERIOD MY MASTER COLONEL A BURWELL WAS SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED IN HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS
ALL BECAME SERENE MISSUS LINCOLN TOOK THE PRESIDENT'S ARM AND WITH SMILING FACE LED THE TRAIN BELOW
THE SHADOW ECLIPSED THE SUNSHINE AND LOVE BROUGHT DESPAIR THE PARTING WAS ETERNAL THE CLOUD HAD NO SILVER LINING
DURING THIS TIME MY MASTER WAS UNUSUALLY KIND TO ME HE WAS NATURALLY A GOOD HEARTED MAN BUT WAS INFLUENCED BY HIS WIFE IT WAS SATURDAY EVENING AND WHILE I WAS BENDING OVER THE BED WATCHING THE BABY THAT I HAD JUST HUSHED INTO SLUMBER
ARRANGING THE CHRISTMAS TREE FOR THE CHILDREN I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK AND THE HANDS POINTED TO A QUARTER OF TWELVE I WAS ARRANGING THE CORDS ON THE GOWN WHEN THE SENATOR CAME IN HE LOOKED SOMEWHAT CAREWORN AND HIS STEP SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE NERVOUS
OF COURSE YOU GAVE SATISFACTION
WHICH MADE HER LOVE FOR ME ALL THE STRONGER I DID NOT KNOW MUCH OF MY FATHER FOR HE WAS THE SLAVE OF ANOTHER MAN AND WHEN MISTER BURWELL MOVED FROM DINWIDDIE HE WAS SEPARATED FROM US
THE TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH WHICH I PURCHASED THE FREEDOM OF MYSELF AND SON I CONSENTED TO ACCEPT ONLY AS A LOAN I WENT TO WORK IN EARNEST AND IN A SHORT TIME PAID EVERY CENT
WAS SOON TO COME OFF AND SHE MUST HAVE A DRESS SUITABLE FOR THE OCCASION THE SILK HAD BEEN PURCHASED BUT A DRESS MAKER HAD NOT YET BEEN FOUND MISS RINGOLD RECOMMENDED ME AND I RECEIVED THE ORDER TO MAKE THE DRESS
BY MAKING AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE OWNER OF MY FATHER BY WHICH THE SEPARATION OF MY PARENTS COULD BE BROUGHT TO AN END IT WAS A BRIGHT DAY INDEED FOR MY MOTHER
I REALIZE HOW CROWDED WITH INCIDENTS MY LIFE HAS BEEN EVERY DAY SEEMS LIKE A ROMANCE WITHIN ITSELF AND THE YEARS GROW INTO PONDEROUS VOLUMES
OWNED ABOUT SEVENTY SLAVES ALL OF WHICH WERE SOLD AND IN A MAJORITY OF INSTANCES WIVES WERE SEPARATED FROM HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS SLAVERY IN THE BORDER STATES FORTY YEARS AGO
I WANT ELIZABETH TO BE A GOOD GIRL
FOR THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAWN OF A BRIGHTER PERIOD IN MY DARK LIFE I PURCHASED THE TRIMMINGS AND MISTER HARPER ALLOWED ME A COMMISSION OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS ON THE PURCHASE THE DRESS WAS DONE IN TIME AND IT GAVE COMPLETE SATISFACTION
AND ON ENTERING THE HOTEL WAS MET BY MISSUS MC CLEAN WHO GREETED ME LIZZIE WHY DID YOU NOT COME YESTERDAY AS I REQUESTED MISSUS LINCOLN WANTED TO SEE YOU BUT I FEAR THAT NOW YOU ARE TOO LATE I AM SORRY MISSUS MC CLEAN
EARN OUR RIGHT TO ENJOY THE SUNSHINE IN THE GREAT HEREAFTER AT THE GRAVE AT LEAST WE SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO LAY OUR BURDENS DOWN THAT A NEW WORLD A WORLD OF BRIGHTNESS
AND AT THE SAME TIME GREW INTO STRONG HEALTHY WOMANHOOD I WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN WHEN WE REMOVED FROM VIRGINIA TO HILLSBORO NORTH CAROLINA
THE STREETS OF THE CAPITAL WERE THRONGED WITH PEOPLE FOR THIS WAS INAUGURATION DAY A NEW PRESIDENT A MAN OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE BROAD PRAIRIES OF THE WEST WAS TO ACCEPT THE SOLEMN OATH OF OFFICE WAS TO ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITIES
THE MOST RESPECTABLE ONE WAS ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO I WAS ASKED TO BE THE FIRST ATTENDANT BUT AS USUAL WITH ALL MY EXPECTATIONS I WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR ON THE WEDDING DAY I FELT MORE LIKE BEING LOCKED UP IN A THREE CORNERED BOX THAN ATTENDING A WEDDING
BUT I HARDLY EXPECT TO SEE THAT HAPPY DAY AT THIS PLACE GIVE MY LOVE TO ALL THE FAMILY BOTH WHITE AND BLACK
WHEN I WAS QUITE A CHILD AN INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH MY MOTHER AFTERWARD IMPRESSED MORE STRONGLY ON MY MIND ONE OF MY UNCLES A SLAVE OF COLONEL BURWELL
WHEN I CALLED ON MISSUS LEE THE NEXT DAY HER HUSBAND WAS IN THE ROOM AND HANDING ME A ROLL OF BANK BILLS AMOUNTING TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE REQUESTED ME TO PURCHASE THE TRIMMINGS AND TO SPARE NO EXPENSE IN MAKING A SELECTION
IT APPEARS THAT MISSUS LINCOLN HAD UPSET A CUP OF COFFEE ON THE DRESS SHE DESIGNED WEARING ON THE EVENING OF THE RECEPTION AFTER THE INAUGURATION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH RENDERED IT NECESSARY
I HAVE MORE WORK NOW PROMISED THAN I CAN DO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO MAKE A DRESS FOR YOU TO WEAR ON SUNDAY NEXT PSHAW NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE I MUST HAVE THE DRESS MADE BY SUNDAY AND SHE SPOKE WITH SOME IMPATIENCE
I MADE FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN DRESSES FOR HER DURING THE SPRING AND EARLY PART OF THE SUMMER WHEN SHE LEFT WASHINGTON SPENDING THE HOT WEATHER AT SARATOGA LONG BRANCH AND OTHER PLACES
HELD FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FAMILIES OF THOSE SOLDIERS WHO WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED DURING THE WAR IN ONE PART OF THE BUILDING WAS A WAX FIGURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS WEARING OVER HIS OTHER GARMENTS
IT WAS WORN I HAVE NOT THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT BY MISTER DAVIS DURING THE STORMY YEARS THAT HE WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES THE HOLIDAYS PASSED AND BEFORE THE CLOSE OF JANUARY THE WAR WAS DISCUSSED IN MISTER DAVIS'S FAMILY
BUT THE HOPE WAS ONLY REALIZED BEYOND THE DARK PORTALS OF THE GRAVE WHEN I WAS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD I WITNESSED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE SALE OF A HUMAN BEING
HE COULD NOT BLAME HIS MOTHER FOR GOD KNOWS THAT SHE DID NOT WISH TO GIVE HIM LIFE HE MUST BLAME THE EDICTS OF THAT SOCIETY WHICH DEEMED IT NO CRIME TO UNDERMINE THE VIRTUE OF GIRLS IN MY THEN POSITION
ON ENTERING THE ROOM I FOUND HIM PREPARED WITH A NEW ROPE AND A NEW COWHIDE I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS READY TO DIE BUT THAT HE COULD NOT CONQUER ME IN STRUGGLING WITH HIM I BIT HIS FINGER SEVERELY
HE CAME IN WITH A BRIGHT FACE WAS PLACED IN THE SCALES AND WAS SOLD LIKE THE HOGS AT SO MUCH PER POUND HIS MOTHER WAS KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF THE TRANSACTION
THE HOLIDAYS WERE APPROACHING AND MISSUS DAVIS KEPT ME BUSY IN MANUFACTURING ARTICLES OF DRESS FOR HERSELF AND CHILDREN SHE DESIRED TO PRESENT MISTER DAVIS ON CHRISTMAS
THEN HELD ME OUT AT ARMS LENGTH AS IF HE WERE REGARDING HIS CHILD WITH PRIDE SHE IS GROWING INTO A LARGE FINE GIRL HE REMARKED TO MY MOTHER I DUN NO WHICH I LIKE BEST YOU
MISSUS KECKLEY HAS MET WITH GREAT SUCCESS AND THEN HE PROCEEDED TO COMPLIMENT THE OTHER LADIES MISSUS LINCOLN LOOKED ELEGANT IN HER ROSE COLORED MOIRE ANTIQUE SHE WORE A PEARL NECKLACE PEARL EAR RINGS PEARL BRACELETS
I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH THAT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH ALONE DESERVES THE NAME OF CATHOLIC IS SO EVIDENT THAT IT IS RIDICULOUS TO DENY IT OURS IS THE ONLY CHURCH WHICH ADOPTS THIS NAME AS HER OFFICIAL TITLE
OUT OF EVERY TRIBE AND TONGUE AND PEOPLE
WHO CALUMNIATE THREE HUNDRED MILLIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS BY ATTRIBUTING TO THEM DOCTRINES AND PRACTICES WHICH THEY REPUDIATE AND ABHOR
YOU ACQUIRE A FULL AND CONNECTED KNOWLEDGE OF GOD'S REVELATION YOU GET POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE TRUTH AS IT IS IN JESUS YOU NO LONGER SEE IT IN FRAGMENTS BUT REFLECTED BEFORE YOU IN ALL ITS BEAUTY AS IN A POLISHED MIRROR
AND TO ATTEMPT TO DEPRIVE US OF IT AT THIS LATE HOUR WOULD BE AS FRUITLESS AS THE EFFORTS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONISTS WHO SOUGHT TO UPROOT ALL TRACES OF THE OLD CIVILIZATION BY ASSIGNING NEW NAMES TO THE DAYS AND SEASONS OF THE YEAR
AND WHICH COULD BE READ AND PONDERED AT LEISURE AS HIS CHIEF AIM HAS BEEN TO BRING HOME THE TRUTHS OF THE CATHOLIC FAITH TO OUR SEPARATED BRETHREN
THE CHURCH IS ONE HOLY CATHOLIC AND APOSTOLIC PREACHING THE SAME CREED EVERYWHERE AND AT ALL TIMES TEACHING HOLINESS AND TRUTH SHE IS OF COURSE ESSENTIALLY UNERRING IN HER DOCTRINE
OR NOT SUBJECT TO SIN EVERY TEACHER IN THE CHURCH FROM THE POPE DOWN TO THE HUMBLEST PRIEST IS LIABLE AT ANY MOMENT LIKE ANY OF THE FAITHFUL TO FALL FROM GRACE AND TO STAND IN NEED OF MORAL REFORMATION
THAT THE DOCTRINAL DECREES OF THE CHURCH WERE IRREVOCABLE AND THAT THE DOGMA OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION WAS DEFINED ONCE AND FOREVER IF ONLY ONE INSTANCE COULD BE GIVEN IN WHICH THE CHURCH CEASED TO TEACH A DOCTRINE OF FAITH WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY HELD
WHO BUILT HIS HOUSE UPON A ROCK AND THE RAIN FELL AND THE FLOODS CAME AND THE WINDS BLEW AND THEY BEAT UPON THAT HOUSE AND IT FELL NOT FOR IT WAS FOUNDED
GO YE THEREFORE AND TEACH ALL NATIONS ET CETERA HE DOES NOT INSTRUCT THEM TO SCATTER BIBLES BROADCAST OVER THE EARTH BUT TO TEACH BY WORD OF MOUTH AND BEHOLD OUR SAVIOR NEVER ARRESTS THE ATTENTION OF HIS HEARERS
THAT DISTINGUISHED THE HUMAN FAMILY THEY SPOKE EVERY CIVILIZED LANGUAGE UNDER THE SUN KNEELING TOGETHER IN THE SAME GREAT COUNCIL HALL TRULY COULD THOSE PRELATES EXCLAIM IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE APOCALYPSE THOU HAST REDEEMED US O LORD TO GOD IN THY BLOOD
PLANTING THE CROSS THE SYMBOL OF SALVATION SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE BANNER OF SAINT GEORGE QUITE RECENTLY A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN EMIGRANTS ARRIVED IN RICHMOND THEY WERE STRANGERS TO OUR COUNTRY TO OUR CUSTOMS AND TO OUR LANGUAGE
AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ADD TO THE MAJESTY OF HIS WORD SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEATH JESUS CONSOLES HIS DISCIPLES BY THIS PROMISE I WILL ASK THE FATHER
DOUBTLESS IT IS A WORK GREATER THAN ANY WORK OF MAN THIS CATHOLICITY OR UNIVERSALITY IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY OR IN ALL OF THE COMBINED COMMUNIONS SEPARATED FROM THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
ON THE TABLES OF CATHOLIC FAMILIES THERE IS NO FREEMASONRY IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SHE HAS NO SECRETS TO KEEP BACK SHE HAS NOT ONE SET OF DOCTRINES FOR BISHOPS AND PRIESTS AND ANOTHER FOR THE LAITY
NEITHER MORMONS NOR MILLERITES NOR THE ADVOCATES OF FREE LOVE OR OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS SO CALLED FIND ANY RECRUITS IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SHE WILL NEVER SUFFER HER CHILDREN TO BE ENSNARED BY THESE IMPOSTURES
ALL THE PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS ARE ESTIMATED AT SIXTY FIVE MILLION OR LESS THAN ONE FIFTH OF THOSE WHO BEAR THE CHRISTIAN NAME
YOU ARE INSIDE WORSHIPING THE DIVINE ARCHITECT AND SAYING DEVOUTLY WITH THE PSALMIST
IT IS A GREAT MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MOST IGNORANT CATHOLIC BELIEVES HE CAN PROCURE THE PARDON OF HIS SINS BY SIMPLY CONFESSING THEM WITHOUT BEING TRULY SORRY FOR THEM
AND IS NOT AN INFALLIBLE GUIDE AS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT YOU TO THE CITY OF GOD IN HEAVEN IS IT NOT MOREOVER A BLESSING AND A CONSOLATION THAT AMID THE EVER CHANGING VIEWS OF MEN AMID THE CONFLICT OF HUMAN OPINION
IT MATTERS NOT TO THE ARTIST THAT COLUMBUS COULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE UNDERTAKEN HIS VOYAGE AND DISCOVERY AS THE EXPLORER HIMSELF AVOWS WERE IT NOT FOR THE BENEVOLENT ZEAL OF THE MONKS ANTONIO DE MARCHENA
CHRISTIANS BECOME CHILDREN OF THE CHURCH NO MATTER WHO POURS UPON THEM THE REGENERATING WATERS IF SHE IS OUR MOTHER WHERE IS OUR LOVE AND OBEDIENCE
TO CONSECRATE THE BREAD AND WINE BECAUSE THE POWER OF DOING SO WAS AT THE LAST SUPPER CONFERRED ON THE APOSTLES IT IS TRUE ALSO THAT OUR LORD SAID TO THE PEOPLE
AT THE END OF THE SECOND CENTURY WRITES THE WORD OF OUR MASTER DID NOT REMAIN IN JUDEA AS PHILOSOPHY REMAINED IN GREECE BUT HAS BEEN POURED OUT OVER THE WHOLE WORLD PERSUADING GREEKS AND BARBARIANS ALIKE RACE BY RACE VILLAGE BY VILLAGE
SECOND A PROMISE THAT HIS PRESENCE WITH THE CHURCH WILL BE CONTINUOUS WITHOUT ANY INTERVAL OF ABSENCE TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE WORLD AND THIS IS ALSO THE SENTIMENT OF THE APOSTLE OF THE GENTILES
UNLESS YE EAT THE FLESH OF THE SON OF MAN AND DRINK HIS BLOOD YE SHALL NOT HAVE LIFE IN YOU BUT THIS COMMAND IS LITERALLY FULFILLED BY THE LAITY WHEN THEY PARTAKE OF THE CONSECRATED BREAD WHICH AS WE HAVE SEEN
THAN PERMIT THEM TO PARTAKE OF A MUTILATED SACRAMENT SECOND IN THE PRIMITIVE DAYS OF THE CHURCH THE HOLY COMMUNION USED TO BE IMPARTED TO INFANTS BUT ONLY IN THE FORM OF WINE THE PRIEST DIPPED HIS FINGER IN THE CONSECRATED CHALICE
THAT THE PROTESTANT TRANSLATORS HAVE PERVERTED THE TEXT BY RENDERING IT WHOSOEVER SHALL EAT THIS BREAD AND DRINK THE CHALICE SUBSTITUTING AND FOR OR IN CONTRADICTION TO THE GREEK ORIGINAL
OUT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN AND THE PROPORTION OF ILLEGITIMATE TO LEGITIMATE CHILDREN NOT AS ONE TO TWO AND THREE TENTHS BUT AS ONE TO ONE AND A HALF
I WOULD NOT BE ATTACHED TO HER MINISTRY NOR EVEN TO HER COMMUNION FOR A SINGLE DAY I KNOW THESE CHARGES TO BE FALSE THE LONGER I KNOW HER THE MORE I ADMIRE AND VENERATE HER
WHOM THEY VENERATED YOU COME BACK LIKE THE PRODIGAL SON TO THE HOME OF YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER THE GARMENT OF JOY IS PLACED UPON YOU THE BANQUET OF LOVE IS SET BEFORE YOU AND YOU RECEIVE THE KISS OF PEACE AS A PLEDGE OF YOUR FILIATION AND ADOPTION
A SOLEMN PREDICTION THAT NO ERROR SHALL EVER INVADE HIS CHURCH AND IF SHE FELL INTO ERROR
TO COMMUNICATE UNDER BOTH KINDS BUT EVEN THE CLERGY OF EVERY RANK INCLUDING THE POPE RECEIVE ONLY OF THE CONSECRATED BREAD UNLESS WHEN THEY CELEBRATE MASS THE CHURCH TEACHES THAT CHRIST IS CONTAINED WHOLE AND ENTIRE
IT HAS BEEN GRAVELY ASSERTED THAT THE CONFESSION OF SIN AND THE DOCTRINE OF ABSOLUTION TEND TO THE SPREAD OF CRIME AND IMMORALITY
THEY MAY BE PREACHING FALSEHOOD TO YOU INSTEAD OF TRUTH IF SO YOU ARE IN DOUBT WHETHER YOU ARE LISTENING TO TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD IF YOU ARE IN DOUBT YOU CAN HAVE NO FAITH FOR FAITH EXCLUDES DOUBT
SOMETIMES IT IS NAMED THE LAYING ON OF HANDS BECAUSE THE BISHOP IMPOSES HIS HANDS ON THOSE WHOM HE CONFIRMS IT IS ALSO KNOWN BY THE NAME OF CHRISM BECAUSE THE FOREHEAD OF THE PERSON CONFIRMED
COMMUNION UNDER ONE KIND OUR SAVIOR GAVE COMMUNION UNDER BOTH FORMS OF BREAD AND WINE TO HIS APOSTLES AT THE LAST SUPPER OFFICIATING BISHOPS AND PRIESTS ARE ALWAYS REQUIRED EXCEPT ON GOOD FRIDAY
IT RAISES INDEED ITS HANDS OVER THE CANDIDATES BUT THEY ARE NOT THE ANOINTED HANDS OF PETER OR JOHN OR CYPRIAN OR AUGUSTINE TO WHOM IT IS SAID WHATSOEVER THOU SHALT BLESS LET IT BE BLESSED
AS AN EARNEST OF FUTURE GLORY
THEY SENT UNTO THEM PETER AND JOHN
BUT WE ARE NOT DISPOSED TO PARADE THESE MONSTROUS VICES NO MATTER BY WHOM COMMITTED WE ALLUDE TO THEM WITH FEELINGS OF SHAME NOT OF PLEASURE
FRANCE SEVEN POINT TWO PRUSSIA
IN COMING BACK TO THE CHURCH YOU WORSHIP WHERE YOUR FATHERS WORSHIPED BEFORE YOU YOU KNEEL BEFORE THE ALTAR AT WHICH THEY KNELT YOU RECEIVE THE SACRAMENTS WHICH THEY RECEIVED AND RESPECT THE AUTHORITY OF THE CLERGY
FOR THERE IS NO WARRANT FOR SUCH AN ASSUMPTION THIS FUNCTION OF IMPOSING HANDS FORMED AS REGULAR AND IMPERATIVE A PART OF THE APOSTOLIC MINISTRY AS THE DUTIES WHICH THEY EXERCISED IN PREACHING BAPTIZING ORDAINING ET CETERA
I COUNTED THE LORD'S PRAYER IN THIRTY TWO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES INSCRIBED ON MARBLE SLABS SO THAT ALMOST ANY PERSON FROM ANY COUNTRY CAN READ THIS PRAYER IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE
ABOUT HALF OF THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE DEPEND WHOLLY UPON AGRICULTURE FOR THEIR LIVING INSTEAD OF LIVING ON FARMS AS WE DO THEY LIVE IN SMALL VILLAGES THEIR FARMS ARE VERY SMALL GENERALLY RUNNING FROM TWO TO FIFTEEN ACRES
IS ALMOST UNKNOWN WITH A DOZEN OR MORE GREAT HOSPITALS AND MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED BOARDS OF HEALTH GREAT THINGS HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED
HIS NAME WAS LYNCH AND HE WAS A LIEUTENANT IN THE AMERICAN NAVY AT THE CLOSE OF THE MEXICAN WAR OUR GOVERNMENT PERMITTED LIEUTENANT LYNCH TO TAKE TEN SEAMEN AND TWO SMALL BOATS
AT THE BASE AND ON THE STEPS IS A WOMAN DRESSED IN MOURNING KNEELING IN THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER WHILE NEARBY IS A WREATH INSCRIBED TO THE UNKNOWN DEAD BACK OF THE TOMB IN THE DISTANCE
WERE SEATED AROUND ONE TABLE CLEMENCEAU WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CONFERENCE AND SAT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE BY HIS SIDE SAT OUR OWN PRESIDENT WHO AT THAT TIME TOWERED HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE STATESMEN OF THE WORLD
THE ADMIRATION AND CONFIDENCE OF THE STATESMEN OF THE WORLD NOTHING LIKE IT HAD EVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE AND THE GRATITUDE OF ALL KNEW NO BOUNDS THEN THE MODEST DIGNIFIED UNSELFISH BEARING OF OUR PRESIDENT AMONG THEM TURNED GRATITUDE INTO LOVE AND DEVOTION
AS A RULE THE SOIL IS THIN AND UNPRODUCTIVE BUT WITH THEIR PATIENT TOIL CAREFUL METHODS OF FARMING AND A VERY LIBERAL USE OF FERTILIZER THEY RAISE ABUNDANT CROPS
IN THE DEVASTATED AREAS ALL LANDMARKS WERE OFTEN OBLITERATED AND IN MANY CASES THE GOVERNMENT BROUGHT IN TRACTORS AND PLOWED GREAT FIELDS WHICH BEFORE THE WAR WERE HUNDREDS OF LITTLE FARMS AND GARDENS
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD A FEW YEARS AGO THE EDITOR OF ONE OF THE GREAT MAGAZINES OF AMERICA SENT OUT A THOUSAND LETTERS TO AS MANY SCIENTISTS AND GREAT MEN SCATTERED AMONG ALL CIVILIZED NATIONS
ALMOST SNEERED WHEN THEY MENTIONED OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS THEY HAVE ALMOST LOST CONFIDENCE IN US AND IT WILL BE HARD TO REGAIN IT FRANCE IS ESPECIALLY BITTER PERHAPS THE RESULT OF THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE
IN THESE ROOMS THERE ARE LARGE MUMMY CASES BUT THEY ARE EMPTY AT THE PRESENT TIME ONE GREAT SATISFACTION FOR ME IN VISITING THE PYRAMIDS WAS THE FULFILLING OF A LIFE LONG DESIRE
AND THE YOUNG MAN CAME BACK ALONE LATER ON FOR ELIJAH WAS TAKEN UP TO HEAVEN IN A WHIRLWIND NOW FIFTY YOUNG MEN HAD FOLLOWED THE TWO PROPHETS TO THE RIVER
BUT THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS NO OTHER THAN THE MASTER HIMSELF EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND THE PREACHER HESITATED NO LONGER IN CONNECTION WITH THE RIVER JORDAN AND THE BODIES OF WATER AT EACH END
WITHOUT AMBITION OR EDUCATION AND BE SATISFIED TO LIVE IN COMFORTLESS TUMBLE DOWN HUTS WITHOUT FURNITURE OR ANY OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING BUT SUCH IS THE CASE
BUT HERE IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS TO DO WITH EVERY FAMILY ON THE EARTH RICH OR POOR CAPITALIST OR LABORING MAN WHITE BLACK
OR OTHERWISE MAINTAIN ANY DOCTRINE OR DOCTRINES NOT ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE
THERE ARE SEVENTY SEVEN OF THESE PYRAMIDS ALTOGETHER THREE OF THEM ARE LOCATED LESS THAN A DOZEN MILES FROM CAIRO THE OTHERS BEING UP THE RIVER NILE A HALF DAY'S JOURNEY THE LARGEST IS KNOWN AS THE PYRAMID OF CHEOPS
WAS BEFORE THE WAR THE PITTSBURG OF FRANCE THIS CITY WAS NOT ONLY THE CENTER OF THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY BUT HAD SCORES AND HUNDREDS OF FACTORIES AND MACHINE SHOPS OF ALL KINDS WHILE THE CITY ITSELF WAS NOT TOTALLY DESTROYED THE FACTORIES WERE ALMOST COMPLETELY RUINED
THAT HE WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT WHEN THE MAN CONTINUED SIR THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION TO US FILIPINOS YOU KNOW THE LAW UNDER WHICH WE HAVE LIVED HERE IS THIS
AS BISHOP OF THE METHODIST CHURCH HE HAD BEEN THERE ABOUT SIX MONTHS WHEN ONE DAY
IT WAS SCIENTIFICALLY AND MATHEMATICALLY CONSTRUCTED AGES BEFORE MODERN SCIENCE OR MATHEMATICS WERE BORN THE ONE WHO PLANNED IT KNEW THAT THE EARTH IS A SPHERE AND THAT ITS MOTION IS ROTARY
WHILE LYING ON THE STEPS BETWEEN HIM AND THE KING IS THE TORN SCRAP OF PAPER BUT IT WOULD TAKE PAGES OF THIS BOOK TO GIVE AN ADEQUATE DESCRIPTION OF THE ENTIRE PANORAMA OF COURSE ALL THE ALLIES ARE REPRESENTED
LIKE PARIS AND RIO JANEIRO SOME FOR THEIR CULTURE AND LEARNING AS BOSTON AND OXFORD SOME FOR THEIR MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIAL SUPREMACY AS DETROIT AND LIVERPOOL
WHILE THE RIVER WAS SO HIGH AND DANGEROUS ANOTHER GREAT EVENT WHICH OCCURRED WAS WHEN THE OLD PROPHET ELIJAH AND THE YOUNG PROPHET ELISHA CROSSED THE RIVER TOGETHER
THE CHILD HAD NEVER HAD EVEN A GLIMPSE OF THE SUNLIGHT WHEN I CLIMBED UPON THIS OLD FORT AND SAW THE STARS AND STRIPES WAVING IN THE BREEZE
WERE BUILT SOME FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND COULD THEY SPEAK THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD LISTEN WITH AMAZEMENT AND HORROR THERE WERE SEVEN GATES IN THIS OLD WALL
WHEN THE SUN AROSE THEY HARDLY BREATHED FOR A WHOLE WEEK THEY WERE AFRAID TO VENTURE FROM THEIR HOMES BUT THERE WAS NO PILLAGE NO PLUNDER AND NO BLOODSHED
NOW IN THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS CRUCIFIED THERE WAS A GARDEN AND IN THE GARDEN A NEW SEPULCHRE WHEREIN NEVER MAN WAS YET LAID THIS TOMB WAS DISCOVERED MANY YEARS AGO
IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE I MADE ANOTHER TRIP TO EUROPE AND THE CHANGE WAS BEYOND ANY POWER TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED UPON AMERICA AS THE ONE GREAT NATION OF THE EARTH
HE HAS SENT TO INDIA CALIFORNIA EGYPT AND NEARLY EVERYWHERE FOR THE RAREST ORCHIDS AND MOST DELICATE PLANTS
AND PRESERVING THE PEACE IN GENERAL THIS FORCE IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE MOUNTED POLICE SYSTEM OF SASKATCHEWAN IN CANADA AND IS A TERROR TO EVIL DOERS
THAT THE BUILDINGS HAD TO BE ENLARGED EVERY STUDENT BORROWED AN AX AND WENT TO WORK FELLING TREES ALONG THE RIVER BANK IN ONE CASE THE AX FLEW OFF THE HANDLE AND WENT INTO THE WATER
AND SHALL BE PUNISHED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE THEN TO THE AMAZEMENT OF MISTER STUNTZ THE MAN CONTINUED UNDER THE OPERATION OF THAT LAW
THE THAMES AND TIBER FOR THE GREAT CITIES ON THEIR BANKS THE VOLGA AND THE DNEIPER FOR THEIR COMMERCE THE NILE AND THE YELLOW RIVERS FOR THEIR ANNUAL OVERFLOW THE FORMER TO GIVE LIFE
AND FOUND THAT THEY WERE BORN IN THE SAME COMMUNITY AND HAD PLAYED TOGETHER WHEN THEY WERE SMALL BOYS HERE THEY HAD WORKED TOGETHER FOR MONTHS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THEY WERE NEIGHBORS THEY ACTUALLY GOT UP AND SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OTHER
IT WAS DURING THAT YEAR THAT ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL AND HIS ASSISTANT THOMAS A WATSON WERE MAKING EXPERIMENTS IN A BUILDING IN BOSTON MISTER WATSON WAS IN THE BASEMENT WITH AN INSTRUMENT TRYING WITHOUT SUCCESS
THE BOATS WERE TAKEN OVERLAND TO THE SEA OF GALILEE AND LAUNCHED AND THIS MAN AND HIS HELPERS WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO THE DEAD SEA IN THEM
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT ALL FRANCE COULD BE PLACED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THERE WOULD BE ROOM ENOUGH LEFT FOR BELGIUM HOLLAND DENMARK AND SWITZERLAND ONE IN EACH CORNER EVEN THEN DELAWARE AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COULD BE PUT IN FOR GOOD MEASURE
YOU CAN SEE THE RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN AND IN SOME INDESCRIBABLE WAY THEY ARE LIGHTING UP THE FACES OF THOSE ON THE TEMPLE STAIRWAY LIKE A BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW OF PROMISE WHILE THE TOMB ITSELF IS LEFT IN THE SHADOWS OF THE DECLINING DAY
THERE WERE COAL MINES IN THE DISTRICT AT ALL THE WRITER WENT OVER THESE RUINS AFTER THE WAR CLOSED AND IT IS SIMPLY BEYOND THE IMAGINATION TO PICTURE THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS AT THAT TIME THE COURSE OF SMALL RIVERS AND STREAMS WERE CHANGED SO THAT THE WATER COULD BE RUN INTO THESE MINES
ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT OF THESE BALLOTS WERE RETURNED PROPERLY MARKED AND THE RESULT WAS MOST INTERESTING INDEED
AFTER MIDNIGHT THINGS BEGUN TO GET PRETTY NOISY SAM AND ME WAS SETTIN WONDERIN IF WE WERE HAVIN A GOOD TIME WHEN A FELLOW STEPPED ON SAM'S FOOT AND SAID BAA
BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES I SHUT THEM A MOMENT BUT WHEN I LOOKED THE GROVE WAS MOVING FASTER IT SLID SWIFTLY AND I COULD PLAINLY HEAR THE RATTLE OF STONES FALLING AGAINST STONES UNTIL WITH A MUFFLED ROAR
STEPPED INTO A BADGER HOLE I THOUGHT BUT HE KEPT STAGGERIN I FELL OFF ON ONE SIDE JUST AS HE PITCHED FORWARD HE TRIED AND TRIED TO GET UP I STAYED TILL HE DIED THEN I KEPT WALKING
I THOUGHT OLD GOLIAR HAD HIT ME A BIFF WITH A BLACKTHORN SHILALEY SHE REMARKED MISTER HAYNES TURNED TO ME AND SAID YOU ARE A DANDY HUNTER YOU DIDN'T SHOOT AT ALL UNTIL AFTER THE ELK WERE GONE
I FELT THAT IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT POOR FATHER COULDN'T SPEAK BUT HIS EYES TOLD ME HOW GRATEFUL HE WAS TO STAY WE HAD OUR LITTLE HOME AND FATHER HAD HIS PENSION AND I WAS ABLE TO GET A SMALL SCHOOL NEAR US
IN CAMP AUGUST THIRTY FIRST NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEAR MISSUS CONEY WE ARE ACROSS THE DESERT AND CAMPED FOR A FEW DAYS FISHING ON A SHADY BOWERY LITTLE STREAM
INSTEAD OF LETTING ME ENJOY THE TABLEAU HE SOLEMNLY DROVE ON SAYING HE WOULD NOT WANT ANY ONE GAWKING AT HIM IF HE WERE THE HAPPY MAN ANYWAY HE COULDN'T URGE CHUB FAST ENOUGH TO PREVENT MY SEEING AND HEARING WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU
SUPPER WAS READY BUT I WENT TO BED AT ONCE THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO STIFF AND SORE I COULD HARDLY MOVE AND SO TIRED I COULDN'T SLEEP NEXT MORNING MY JAW AND NECK WERE SO SWOLLEN
I NEVER SAW SUCH A COUNTRY AS THE WEST
THE MOUNTAINS ON ONE SIDE WERE CRESTED GREAT CRAGS AND PILES OF ROCK CROWNED THEM AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE TIMBER GREW ONLY ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE TRUNKS OF THE QUAKING ASPENS SHONE SILVERY IN THE EARLY SUNLIGHT AND THEIR LEAVES WERE SHIMMERING GOLD
THERE IS PLENTY OF WOOD WATER AND FEED AND LOOKING EASTWARD DOWN THE VALLEY SNOW COVERED CRAG TOPPED MOUNTAINS DELIGHT THE EYE THE AIR IS SO BRACING THAT WE ALL FEEL EQUAL TO ANYTHING
NOT A TREE NOT EVEN A BUSH EXCEPT SAGE BRUSH LUCKILY THERE WAS PLENTY OF THAT SO WE HAD ROARING FIRES WE SAT AROUND THE FIRE TALKING AS THE BLUE SHADOWS FADED INTO GRAY DUSK AND THE BIG STARS CAME OUT
AND WITH A STICK I CAN BEAT THE SAGE BUSH WHICH WILL GIVE ME THE SMELL YOU WILL SMELL OF THE OUTSIDE AND FOR THE GAME I CAN HAVE A BEEF KILL WHICH ISS BETTER TO EAT AS ELK I LOVE MISSUS LOUDERER DEARLY
THEY HAD HEARD OUR SHOT AND CAME ACROSS TO SEE WHAT LUCK WHAT IVER IS THE MATTER WITH YE ASKED MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MISTER HAYNES TOLD HER THEY HAD HEARD THE NOISE BUT HAD THOUGHT IT THUNDER MISTER HAYNES TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD CHIRK UP
WE HAD ABOUT RESOLVED TO GO TO OUR HORSES WHEN WE HEARD A VOLLEY OF SHOTS THAT IS SOMEBODY BUNCH SHOOTING SAID MISTER STRUBLE THEY ARE IN BREWSTER LAKE PARK BY THE SOUND THAT MEANS THAT THE ELK WILL PASS HERE IN A SHORT TIME AND WE MAY GET A SHOT
LOOK WHO'S HERE SEE WHO'S COME THEY YELLED THEY WENT TO WORK SETTING UP TENTS AND UNLOADING WAGONS WITH A HEARTY GOOD WILL WE ARE CAMPED JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE PINES BACK OF US RISES A BIG PINE CLAD MOUNTAIN
AS HE HAD HEARD THEY WERE FINE EATING HAVING STRATA OF FAT ALTERNATING WITH STRATA OF LEAN MISTER HAYNES IS A QUIET FELLOW JUST INTERESTED IN HUNTING MISTER STRUBLE IS THE BIG MAN OF THE PARTY
I KNOW SHE WOULD NOT SHOOT ONE OF THOSE BIG GUNS FOR A DOZEN ELK BESIDES THAT SHE IS VERY TENDER HEARTED AND WILL NEVER HARM ANYTHING HERSELF ALTHOUGH SHE LIKES TO JOIN OUR HUNTS I THINK YOU MUST BE TIRED OF THIS LETTER SO I AM GOING TO SAY GOOD NIGHT MY FRIEND
OUR TENTS ARE SET UNDER SOME BIG TREES ON A SMALL PLATEAU AND RIGHT BELOW US IS A VALLEY IN WHICH GRASS GROWS KNEE HIGH AND LITTLE STREAMS COME FROM EVERY WAY TROUT SCURRY UP STREAM WHENEVER WE GO NEAR
THE CHILDREN ARE STANDING THE TRIP WELL EXCEPT THAT ROBERT IS A LITTLE SUN BLISTERED DID I TELL YOU WE LEFT JUNIOR WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE OTHER THREE MY HEART IS HUNGRY FOR MY BIG BOY
WHILE THEY WERE GONE WE HELPED ELIZABETH TO DRESS ALL THE WHILE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY WAS ADMONISHING HER TO NAME HER FIRST GIRUL MARY ELLEN OR SHE SAID
AND WE HELD OUR BREATH UNTIL WE EMERGED ON THE OTHER SIDE MISTER SORENSON IS A VERY CAPABLE AND CONSCIENTIOUS GAME WARDEN AND A VERY GENIAL GENTLEMAN HE RODE DOWN TO MEET US
HIS HAIR WAS SO WHITE AND SO DUSTY THAT ALTOGETHER HE WAS A PITIFUL LOOKING OBJECT HE GREETED US PLEASANTLY AND SAID THAT HIS NAME WAS OLAF SWANSON AND THAT HE WAS A SHEEP HERDER THAT HE HAD SEEN US AND HAD COME TO ASK FOR A LITTLE SMOKING
MARY ELLEN I HAVE A REAL TREAT AND SURPRISE FOR YOU JUST WAIT A FEW MINUTES AN I'LL BET YOU'LL BE HAPPY WE TOOK OUR ACCUSTOMED PLACES AROUND THE FIRE WHILE MISTER MURRY HOBBLED HIS CAYUSE AND TOOK AN ODD LOOKING BUNDLE FROM HIS SADDLE
THE ELK WILL BE HERE LONG BEFORE THE MEN SINCE THE MEN HAVE NO HORSES SO LET'S HURRY AND GET PLACED ALONG THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GET OUT WE'LL GET OUR LIMIT WE HASTILY SECRETED OURSELVES ALONG THE NARROW GORGE THROUGH WHICH THE ELK MUST PASS
SAND HAD BLOWN INTO THE RIVER UNTIL THE WATER WAS BURIED WATER WAS ONLY A FEW FEET DOWN AND THE BANKS WERE CLEARLY DEFINED SOMETIMES WE CAME TO A SMALL DIRTY PUDDLE BUT IT WAS SO ALKALINE THAT NOTHING COULD DRINK IT
BY PIPING PAST THE ALKALI STRATA I KEPT HOPING HE WOULD TELL HOW OLAF WAS KEPT AND WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM BUT HE NEVER TOLD HE INVITED US TO PREPARE OUR SUPPER IN HIS KITCHEN
SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT GOING TO HUNT SHE TOLD US WE COULD GIVE HER A SMALL PIECE OF ILK AND THAT WOULD DO SO WE WERE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN SHE PURCHASED TWO LICENSES ONE A SPECIAL WHICH WOULD ENTITLE HER TO A BULL ELK
CLYDE TOOK HER TEAM TO THE LIVERY BARN AND SHE CAME UP TO MY ROOM WITH ME IT'S GOING WITH YOU I AM SHE BEGAN YE'LL NEED SOMEBODY TO KEEP YEZ STRAIGHT AND TO SEW UP THE HOLES YE'LL BE SHOOTING INTO EACH OTHER
THE MEN HAD TO FIND THEM AND AS IT TOOK MOST OF THE DAY WE HAD TO PUT OFF OUR HUNT WE WERE UP AND ABOUT NEXT MORNING IN THE FIRST FAINT GRAY LIGHT WHILE THE MEN FED GRAIN TO THE HORSES AND SADDLED THEM WE PREPARED A HASTY BREAKFAST
AND WE WERE MIGHTY THANKFUL TO FIND IT IT CAME OUT THAT OUR YOUNG COUPLE WERE BRIDE AND GROOM THEY HAD NEVER SEEN EACH OTHER UNTIL THE NIGHT BEFORE HAVING MET THROUGH A MATRIMONIAL PAPER
WE ARE CAMPED SO NEAR THE GREAT PINES THAT I WILL CONFESS I WAS POWERFULLY AFRAID HAD THE LIGHTNING STRUCK ONE OF THE BIG PINES THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ONE OF US LEFT I COULD HEAR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MURMURING HER PRAYERS WHEN THERE WAS A LULL
THEIR SUNSHADE KEPT REVOLVING ABOUT THAT WAY AND SOMETIMES THEIR HEADS REVOLVED A LITTLE BIT TOO
I COULD TAKE CARE OF FATHER AND TEACH ALSO WE WERE VERY COMFORTABLY SITUATED AND IN TIME BECAME REALLY HAPPY ALTHOUGH I SELDOM HEARD FROM WALLACE HIS LETTERS WERE WELL WORTH WAITING FOR AND I KNEW HE WAS DOING WELL
IF HE IS STATIONED IN THE BRIDGES RESERVE THEY WOULD BE SURE TO KNOW OF HIM AT ANY OF THESE LITTLE PLACES I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT I HAVE ONLY I THINK I OWE IT TO YOU AND IT WAS EASIER BECAUSE OF THE HOLTS
AND EVERY MAN MY FIST HIT RESTED ON THE FLOOR TILL SOMEBODY HELPED HIM AWAY
ONLY WHEN THE OPEN SEASON TAKES HUNTERS TO THE MOUNTAINS WHEN YOU PEOPLE COME BACK WILL YOU STOP AND ASK FOR THE MAIL FOR ME
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO FATHER DIED GENTLY WENT TO SLEEP I WAITED SIX MONTHS AND THEN WROTE TO WALLACE BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY
BUT MISTER STEWART WANTED TO REST THE BEASTIES AND WE ALL WANTED TO FISH SO WE CAMPED FOR A DAY OR TWO THE TWENTY EIGHTH WAS THE WARMEST DAY WE HAVE HAD THE MOST DISAGREEABLE IN EVERY WAY
AND AFTER US CAME MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AND MISS HULL BROUGHT UP THE REAR WITH THE PROFESSOR RIDING HORSEBACK BESIDE FIRST ONE WAGON AND THEN ANOTHER SO WE SET OUT
DON'T YOU THINK WE KNOW THERE WILL BE NO SHEEP ON THE DESERT BEFORE THERE IS SNOW TO MAKE WATER FOR THEM I AM WHAT I SAY I AM HE SAID I AM NOT HERDING NOW BECAUSE SORROW HAS DROVE ME TO DIG WELLS

NEITHER OF THEM CARES FOR STRENUOUS SPORTS THE FAT MAN DISLIKES THEM BECAUSE HE IS TOO HEAVY ON HIS FEET THE CEREBRAL DISLIKES THEM BECAUSE HE IS TOO HEAVY AT THE OPPOSITE EXTREMITY
THEN HAVE ALL THE QUALIFICATIONS A POWERFUL VOICE HUMAN SYMPATHY DEMOCRACY AND SIMPLICITY
WILL HIMSELF BE A HAZY MYTH AND WHEN SOCIETY IDLERS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN PEOPLE WHO EARN THEIR LIVINGS THE WORLD'S PATHFINDER THE CEREBRAL THEREFORE LEADS THE WORLD IN IDEAS
AND DOES NOT BELONG IN ANY STRICTLY COMMERCIAL BUSINESS REMEMBER THE CHIEF DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF THE THORACIC IN THE ORDER OF THEIR IMPORTANCE
THE MUSCULAR WILL HAVE DURABLE SOLID PLAIN THINGS THE OSSEOUS WILL HAVE FEWER OF EVERYTHING BUT WHAT HE DOES HAVE WILL BE IN ORDER BUT THE PURE CEREBRAL'S FURNISHINGS IF HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM WILL BE AN INDIFFERENT ARRAY
GETTING THINGS DONE THAT HE IS LIKELY TO FORGET
A COMBINATION OF THE FIFTH TYPE WITH THE MUSCULAR MAKES MOST HAND ARTISTS
WHEREAS THE FAT MAN WHEN FURNISHING A HOME DEVOTES HIS ATTENTION TO SOFT BEDS STEAM HEAT AND PLENTY OF CUSHIONED DIVANS THE THORACIC THINKS OF THE CHANDELIERS THE UNUSUAL CHAIRS THE PRETTY FRONT DOORSTEP THE LANDSCAPE GARDENING AND THE COLOR SCHEMES
LIKES RESPONSIVE PEOPLE WE ALL LIKE ANSWERS WE WANT TO BE ASSURED THAT WHAT WE HAVE SAID OR DONE HAS REGISTERED THE THORACIC IS ALWAYS SAYING OR DOING SOMETHING AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY OTHER PEOPLE ARE SO UNRESPONSIVE
IS NOW AGREED BY PSYCHOLOGISTS THE THING WE HAVE CALLED INTUITION THEY MAINTAIN IS NOT DUE TO IRREGULAR OR SUPERNATURAL CAUSES BUT TO OUR OWN NORMAL NATURAL MENTAL PROCESSES
DOMESTIC WEAKNESS CRUEL ANGRY WORDS DO THE MUSCULAR MUCH HARM IN HIS FAMILY LIFE THEY CAUSE HIS NEAREST AND DEAREST TO HOLD AGAINST HIM THE RESENTMENTS THAT FOLLOW SHOULD AIM AT
AS TO GIVE HIM A RIGHT ANGLED FACE HIS SQUARE JAW A BROAD JAW IS ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS TYPE NOT ONLY IS IT SQUARE LOOKED AT FROM THE FRONT
AND FINDS LIKE THE BOY RECOVERING FROM THE CHICKENPOX THAT HE SIMPLY HASN'T IT ANY MORE DISEASES HE IS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO ACUTE DISEASES ARE THE ONES CHIEFLY AFFECTING THIS TYPE
BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO PURCHASE MORE THAN THE MOST LIMITED QUANTITIES OF THE PRECIOUS SUBSTANCE ABOUT CLOTHES CLOTHES ARE ALMOST THE LAST THING THE CEREBRAL THINKS ABOUT
NOT SECRETIVE THE THORACIC DOES NOT BY PREFERENCE COVER UP HE DOES NOT BY PREFERENCE SECRETE HE DOES NOT EXCEPT WHEN NECESSARY KEEP HIS PLANS AND WAYS DARK
UNCOMMON WORKS OF ART ARE USUALLY FOUND IN THE HOMES OF THIS TYPE THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THINGS FROM THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY PLACES ARE ESPECIAL PREFERENCES WITH HIM HE CARRIES OUT HIS DESIRE FOR ATTENTION HERE
ITALIANS POLES GREEKS RUSSIANS GERMANS AND JEWS ARE LARGELY OF THIS TYPE
MOVEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT AS TIME WENT ON MOVEMENT BECAME NECESSARY FULL DEVELOPMENT NOT BEING POSSIBLE TO ANY STATIC ORGANISM
AND WHY IT LIVES THAT WAY WE WILL KNOW WHY ONE CHILD JUST NATURALLY TELLS FIBS WHILE HIS TWIN BROTHER UNDER IDENTICAL TRAINING JUST NATURALLY TELLS THE TRUTH
THE THORACIC IS ALSO EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF DANCING ENJOYS VAUDEVILLE THE AVERAGE THORACIC ENJOYS VAUDEVILLE
UPON THE HUMAN HAND SUCH AS PAINTING ARCHITECTURE CRAFTSMANSHIP CARTOONING SCULPTURE VIOLIN PIANO ET CETERA ALL THESE ARE CREATED BY SQUARE FINGERED PEOPLE
A LOVE OF THE ESTHETIC REFINED AND BEAUTIFUL AND REAL ARTISTIC APPRECIATION BUT NOT THE ABILITY TO CREATE THE HAND ARTS BEFORE WE EXPLAIN THIS
THIS ENTHUSIASM LITERALLY BURNS HIS WAY TO THE THINGS HE WANTS THE PLAIN TALKER WHEN DEEPLY MOVED THIS TYPE TALKS WELL IF THE MENTAL ELEMENT IS ALSO STRONG HE CAN BECOME A GOOD PUBLIC SPEAKER FOR HE WILL
THESE HAVE MADE HIM THE BORN ORATOR THE RADICAL
NO ORGANISM COULD MOVE ITSELF FROM THE SPOT IN WHICH IT WAS BORN BIOLOGY TEACHES US THAT THE STOMACH WAS THE FIRST THING EVOLVED THE ORIGINAL ONE CALL ORGANISM POSSESSED BUT ONE FUNCTION DIGESTION AS LIFE PROGRESSED IT BECAME NECESSARY TO SEND NUTRIMENT
HE PREFERS STAYING AT THE SAME JOB WITH CONGENIAL ASSOCIATES TO FINDING ANOTHER EVEN IF IT PAID MORE VERY OFTEN POOR SINCE WE GET ONLY WHAT WE GO AFTER IN THIS WORLD IT FOLLOWS THAT THE CEREBRAL IS OFTEN POOR
INTELLECTUALS LIKE HIMSELF ARE THE KINDS OF PEOPLE THE CEREBRAL ENJOYS MOST ANOTHER REASON WHY HE HAS FEW FRIENDS IS BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE BEING IN THE GREAT MINORITY ARE NOT EASY TO FIND IGNORES THE IGNORANT
THAN TO OTHERS EACH TYPE HAS ITS OWN WEAKNESSES AND POINTS OF STRENGTH AS DIFFERENTIATED FROM OTHER TYPES AND THESE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE MORAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLE NO TYPE SUPERIOR MORALLY
BEING OVER EQUIPPED FOR IT KEEP URGING HIM FROM WITHIN TO DO THINGS
ARE THE OUTSTANDING EMOTIONAL ASSETS OF THIS TYPE EMOTIONAL LIABILITIES IMPATIENCE MERCURIAL EMOTIONS AND THE EXPENDITURE OF TOO MUCH OF HIS ELECTRICITY IN EVERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE ARE THE TENDENCIES MOST TO BE GUARDED AGAINST
TAKING HIM DOWN A PEG WHENEVER HE TRIES HIS HIGH AND MIGHTY AIRS ON HIM DEFENDS THE UNDER DOG STANDING BY THE UNDER DOG IS A KIND OF RELIGION WITH THIS TYPE
HAVING DECIDED WHICH TYPE PREDOMINATES AND WHICH IS SECOND IN HIM THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS COMBINATION IS MADE CLEAR TO YOU BY THE FOLLOWING LAW LAW OF COMBINATION THE TYPE
MUST BE DOING SOMETHING I CAN'T BEAR TO BE DOING NOTHING YOU OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE SAY SUCH A PERSON ALWAYS HAS PLENTY OF MUSCLE
NOR TO ADVENTURE SO MUCH AS THE THORACIC BUT STICKS TO PRACTICAL SUBJECTS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
PEOPLE FROM OTHER SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY ET CETERA THE EASTERNER AND WESTERNER HAVE A NATURAL DISTRUST OF EACH OTHER AND THE CIVIL WAR IS NOT THE ONLY REASON FOR THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF SOUTHERNERS AND NORTHERNERS SO IT IS WITH INDIVIDUALS
HIS FASTIDIOUS HABITS THE THORACIC IS THE MOST FASTIDIOUS OF ALL THE TYPES HIS THIN SKIN AND SENSITIVE NERVES
TONE DOWN THIS POWERFUL VOICE HIS LONG SUFFERING FRIENDS WILL TESTIFY TO THIS CHARACTERISTIC HIS STENTORIAN TONES THIS LOUD VOICE IS A SERIOUS SOCIAL HANDICAP TO HIM HIS ONLY CHANCE OF COMPENSATION FOR IT LIES
PEOPLE WHO LET OTHERS DO THEIR THINKING FOR THEM AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF THE GREAT THINGS GOING ON IN WORLD MOVEMENTS ARE NOT POPULAR WITH THIS TYPE HE SOMETIMES HAS A SECRET CONTEMPT FOR THEM
HE IS IN DANGER OF APOPLEXY THE COMBINATION OF EXTREME THORACIC AND EXTREME ALIMENTIVE TENDENCIES IS THE CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE LIKES FANCY FOODS VARIETY AND NOVELTY IN FOOD
THIS SYSTEM CONSISTS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE ORGANISM
PREDOMINATING IN A PERSON DETERMINES WHAT HE DOES THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE THE NATURE OF HIS MAIN ACTIVITIES THE TYPE WHICH COMES SECOND IN DEVELOPMENT WILL DETERMINE THE WAY HE DOES THINGS THE METHODS HE WILL FOLLOW IN DOING WHAT HIS PREDOMINANT TYPE SIGNIFIES
BUT HE CARES LESS FOR COLOR THAN THE THORACIC QUALITY RATHER THAN STYLE AND PLAINNESS RATHER THAN PRETTINESS ARE HIS STANDARDS IN DRESS MAKING OVER FATHER'S PANTS FOR JOHNNIE IS A JOB MUSCULAR WOMEN HAVE EXCELLED IN AND FOR WHICH THEY HAVE BECOME FAMOUS
IF HE HAS BUT TEN STEPS TO GO HE WILL START OFF AS IF BEGINNING AN AROUND THE WORLD MARATHON YOU HEAR HIM COMING ALL MUSCULARS NOTIFY PEOPLE BY THEIR WALK OF THEIR APPROACH THEY ARE UNCONSCIOUS OF THIS LOUD INCISIVE TREAD
HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE IN BUSINESS GET HIS NAME ON THE DOTTED LINE NOW OR DON'T EXPECT IT IF HE IS AN EMPLOYEE LET HIM COME INTO DIRECT CONTACT WITH PEOPLE GIVE HIS PERSONALITY A CHANCE TO GET BUSINESS FOR YOU
FOR HE KNOWS THAT THE REWARDS HE IS AFTER CAN NOT BE HAD BY THE DOWN AND OUTER THE NATURAL AND NORMAL VANITY OF THE THORACIC STANDS HIM IN HAND HERE MORE THAN IN ALMOST ANY OTHER PLACE IN LIFE THE WORLD ENTERTAINED BY THEM
OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE TWO NATURES THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRETY
AND OFTEN A GOOD DEAL BETTER THIS TYPE DOES NOT PURPOSE TO BE OUTWITTED BY LIFE HE TRIES ALWAYS TO PUT UP A GOOD SHOWING WHEN HE IS POOR THE THORACIC IS SELDOM POOR HE HAS SO MUCH PERSONALITY
BUT THE CEREBRAL IS BORN OLD FROM INFANCY HE SHOWS MORE MATURITY THAN OTHER CHILDREN THE TEACHER'S PET HIS STUDIOUSNESS AND TRACTABLENESS LEAD TO ONE REWARD IN CHILDHOOD THOUGH IT OFTEN COSTS HIM DEAR AS A MAN
WE SPECIFY THE REFERENCE ROOM OF THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THOSE WHO SEARCH FOR FICTION NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES ARE NOT NECESSARILY OF THE PURE TYPE
BUT WHO WILL NOT INTERRUPT HIS STREAM OF TALK PEOPLE HE DISLIKES THE STOLID INDIFFERENT OR COLD ARE PEOPLE THE THORACIC COMES VERY NEAR DISLIKING THEIR EVIDENT SELF COMPLACENCY AND IMMOBILITY
AND IT WASN'T GOOD STUFF TO BREATHE I CAN TELL YOU FIRST THEY SET MEN SHOVELING IT OUT WITH SPONGES IN THEIR MOUTHS AGAINST THE DUST AND GASES BUT ONE MAN COUGHED SO HARD HE TORE SOMETHING IN HIS LUNGS OR HEAD AND DIED THEN THEY SENT FOR A DIVER
AT A DOWNWARD SLANT AND IN THIS I PUT SOME CRUMBS OF DYNAMITE NOT MUCH ONLY ABOUT HALF A TEASPOONFUL AND THEN I STUCK IN THE FUSE AND TAMPED HER SOLID WITH SAND
WHERE WAS OUR ARMY BACK IN ALEXANDRIA SIR AND IT MAKES A MAN SAD TO KNOW THAT THOSE BOYS IN KHARTUM WERE DYING JUST THEN
HE HAD PRESSING BUSINESS ON THE GROUND BY THE TIME I GOT DOWN YOU COULD SEE A LITTLE TRAIL OF BLUISH SMOKE DRIFTING AWAY FROM THE HOLE AND THERE WAS A HUSH OVER THE CROWD EXCEPT FOR THE POLICE TRYING TO MAKE THEM STAND BACK BEHIND THE ROPES
BESIDES THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY THEY WERE CARRYING A HEAVY LOAD AND THE WIND WAS SOUTHEAST BLOWING HARD THE VERY WIND TO MAKE TROUBLE AT THE BAD PLACES
AND A GAS THAT WAS LIKE NOTHING
WHICH IS SYMBOLIZED EVERYWHERE IN THE BOOTS RANGED AT BUNK SIDES OF SIGHING SLEEPERS IN THE BRASS COLUMNS SMOOTH AS GLASS THAT REACH UP THROUGH MANHOLES IN THE FLOOR
ASLEEP NOW UP STAIRS AGAINST THE NIGHT'S EMERGENCIES ASK ANY FIREMAN IN NEW YORK TO TELL YOU ABOUT AHEARN AND YOU'LL FIND THERE IS ONE BUSINESS WHERE JEALOUSY DOESN'T RULE AHEARN
IT WOULD WORK FEARFUL DESTRUCTION IF LARGE ENOUGH AND THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING SUCH A SIZE
OF COURSE AS WE ROSE AND THE AIR BECAME RAREFIED THIS HYDROGEN WOULD EXPAND AGAINST THE DECREASING AIR PRESSURE AND AT A HEIGHT OF TWO MILES OUR ORIGINAL TEN THOUSAND FEET OF GAS MIGHT HAVE SWELLED TO TWENTY THOUSAND FEET AT FIVE MILES TO THIRTY THOUSAND FEET
THIS IS A TIME HONORED CUSTOM
HE WAS A GOOD PILOT BUT OVERFOND OF THE CONVIVIAL GLASS AND WAS NO DOUBT THIS VERY MOMENT IN SOME UPROARIOUS COMPANY FORGETFUL THAT THE START WAS TO BE SHARP ON THE HOUR WELL THEY WOULD GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES MORE
HOW DID YOU GET UP THAT FIFTEEN FEET I INQUIRED WORKED UP ON THE STIRRUPS THAT IS TWO NOOSES AROUND THE STEEPLE EACH ENDING IN A LOOP ONE FOR THE RIGHT FOOT ONE FOR THE LEFT
AND ALWAYS HE POSTPONED BEGINNING AND WITH ONE EXCUSE OR ANOTHER TOOK HIS BOATS THROUGH THE LACHINE CANAL A SAFE BUT TAME SHORT CUT NOT LIKELY TO DRAW TOURISTS
HAD NOT A SAWFISH SENT BY THE EVIL POWER THAT THWARTED THEM THRUST ITS JAGGED WEAPON THROUGH THE HAWSER STRANDS
IT IS TRUE I HAD AT VARIOUS TIMES TAKEN HYDROGEN INTO MY LUNGS BUT NEVER HAD I TRIED TO SPEAK IN HYDROGEN NOW WAS MY CHANCE
NOTHING WHO CAN SAY THAT IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE LAND OF NOTHING TO HE HESITATED YOU MEAN
I SHOUTED AS LOUD AS I COULD INSIDE THAT BALLOON THINK OF IT
AND HE EXPLAINED THAT THEY LIVED THERE THROUGH THE WINTER MONTHS THEY AND OTHER PILOTS MANY OTHERS IT WAS A PILOT COLONY SET OUT IN MIDSTREAM
AND LET YOU PUNCH HIM IN THE STOMACH AND HEAR EM RATTLE AROUND THEN HE'D LIGHT A MATCH
I DON'T KNOW AS I EVER SAW A BIGGER CROWD THE STREET WAS JAMMED FOR BLOCKS EITHER WAY WELL SIR THAT WAS A QUEER ACTING FUSE IT SMOKED AND SMOKED FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES
YOU COULD NEVER FIND OUT WHAT BILL BROWN DID FROM BROWN HIMSELF THE CLOCK TICKED ON SOME SERVICE CALLS RANG ON THE TELEPHONE
IN MAKING ASCENSIONS WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BREATHE TOO MUCH GAS FROM THE BALLOON NECK WHICH HANGS OPEN OVER THE BASKET MORE THAN ONE AERONAUT HAS BEEN GRADUALLY OVERCOME WITHOUT REALIZING THAT HE WAS IN DANGER
MINUTE I INTERRUPTED WERE YOU STANDING INSIDE THE BALLOON SO THAT YOU HAD TO BREATHE HYDROGEN THE PROFESSOR SMILED I STOOD INSIDE THE BALLOON BUT I BREATHED NOTHING
LEANED AGAINST THE STEP LADDER THAT REACHED DOWN FROM HATCH TO CABIN ON THE DUNDERBERG AND REMARKED WHILE THE OTHERS LISTENED I DID A QUEER JOB OF DIVING ONCE DOWN INTO THE HOLD OF A STEAMSHIP A NATIONAL LINER
JUST OPPOSITE OUR HOLE WHERE THE JACK WAS IN OTHER WORDS WE HAD THE STEEPLE SHORED IN SO THAT WHEN WE LET HER GO NO LOOSE STONES COULD FALL ON THE WEST SIDE EVERYTHING MUST FALL TO THE EAST LAST OF ALL
IN A HALF CIRCULAR MOUTH ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH AND IN THIS MOUTH WERE TWO TEETH ONE MIGHT SAY
ON THIS CAME THE SOUND
THEY TOOK THE BALLOON SOME MILES OUT OF WASHINGTON THE PROFESSOR INSISTED ON THIS
HE HAD GOT OUT OF HIS COURSE ONE NIGHT IN THE DANGEROUS WAYS OFF CRANE ISLAND AND FINALLY DROPPED ANCHOR TO HOLD HER AGAINST THE CRUSH OF ICE
AND WHEN THE ROPE TIGHTENED IT SNAPPED AND DOWN SHE WENT SEVEN STORIES KILLED HER BANG THE CHIEF SAW THAT WOULD NEVER DO SO WE WENT UP ON THE ROOF AND THREW OVER MORE ROPE
SHOULDERS HEAVING OFF FOR HOME
THEY GAVE HIM THE MEDAL FOR THAT AND PROMOTED HIM SAY YOU'D NEVER GUESS HOW HE ENDED UP HOW I ASKED GOT HIT BY A CABLE CAR YES SIR HURT SO BAD THEY RETIRED HIM
ARE YOU SURE IT WON'T SMASH DOWN ON THEIR HOUSETOPS
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN BESIDES HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HITCH FAST THE ROPE THAT WILL PULL IT OVER AND WHO WILL CLIMB WITH SUCH A ROPE TO THE STEEPLE TOP IT MUST BE SAID
HE WENT THROUGH FIRE SIR THAT NEARLY BURNED HIS HEAD OFF IT DID BURN OFF THE RIMS OF HIS EARS BUT HE GOT TO THAT BED SOMEHOW AND THEN HE FOUND HE'D DONE IT ALL FOR NOTHING THERE WASN'T ANY BABY THERE TO SAVE
DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN I ONLY WONDER
WRECKED ON A BAR IN THE MAGDALENA RIVER UNITED STATES OF COLOMBIA I'D BEEN WORKING FOR DAYS PATCHING HER KEEL HUNG ON A SWINGING SHELF WE'D LOWERED ALONG HER SIDE
HAVE YOU LOST ANY LIVES I ASKED REACHING OUT FOR THRILLING STORIES NEVAIR SAID HE EVER COME NEAR IT
YOU STAND IN THE RIGHT STIRRUP AND WORK THE LEFT LOOP UP THEN YOU STAND IN THE LEFT STIRRUP AND WORK THE RIGHT LOOP UP SOMETIMES IN HARD PLACES YOU HAVE TO THROW YOUR NOOSES AROUND THE SHAFT AS A COWBOY CASTS A ROPE COME DOWN SOME DAY AND WATCH US WORK
THE IRON JACK BITING INTO THE BLOCK OF NORWAY PINE
BUT WE GOT RAIN WHENEVER WE WANTED IT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN I INQUIRED IF A VERY LARGE BALLOON FILLED WITH THIS EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE WERE SET OFF OVER A CROWDED CITY THE PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
FIRST A LOT OF HALF INCH WIRE CABLE ENOUGH FOR FOUR TURNS AROUND THE STEEPLE THEN EIGHT SIXTEEN FOOT TIMBERS TWO INCHES THICK AND A FOOT WIDE THEN A LOT OF MAPLE WEDGES
CROSS TO PAVEMENT BUT CHURCHES PASS LIKE OTHER THINGS AND NEAR THE CENTURY END CAME THE DECISION BY LANDOWNERS AND LEASE INTERPRETERS THAT THIS GRACEFUL LENGTH OF BROWNSTONE AND THE PILE BENEATH IT MUST MOVE OFF THE PREMISES WHICH MEANT OF COURSE
YOU SEE AND BY SCREWING UP THE JACK WE COULD MAKE THAT PART AS SOLID AS THE KEYSTONE WAS WE MADE THIS HOLE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE STEEPLE
SO ONE DAY A BATTALION CHIEF CALLED HIS BLUFF
THEN EACH MAN WILL TELL YOU A DIFFERENT THING THE DRIVER'S FAVORITE STORY
A PILOT IN COON SKINS WAS SURE IT WOULD COME THEY WOULD PUT ON ONE OF THESE NEW FANGLED ICE CRUNCHING STEAMERS TO KEEP THE MAIN CHANNEL OPEN
WAS THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH IN HARTFORD THAT STOOD FOR YEARS ON PEARL STREET AND WAS FAMOUS ALIKE FOR THE BURNING WORDS SPOKEN BENEATH ITS ROOF AND THE TALL STRAIGHT SPIRE THAT REACHED ABOVE IT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT FEET MEASURED THE DROP FROM
AND LANDED IN THE TRENCH EVERY STONE OF IT THERE WASN'T A PIECE AS BIG AS YOUR FINGERNAIL SIR OUTSIDE THAT TRENCH AND WHILE SHE WAS FALLING I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY KODAKS WERE SNAPPED IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A PICTURE
A DARING MAN AND FAMOUS IN HIS DASHES FROM FIRE TO FIRE OVER THE CITY IN THESE DAYS OF IDOL BREAKING IT IS GOOD TO SEE SUCH HERO WORSHIP AS ONE FINDS HERE FOR ALL MEN WHO DESERVE IT WHETHER IN HUMBLE STATION OR NEAR THE TOP
AND D YE KNOW ABOUT THE RESCUE HE MADE UP IN WILLIAMSBRIDGE WHEN THAT BARREL OF KEROSENE EXPLODED
THERE SIR IS THE PADDLE HE USED IF YOU DOUBT THE TALE AND THE CANOE LIES OUT IN THE SNOW
THINK OF THAT HOUR AFTER HOUR WITH PADDLES ALONE THESE DAUNTLESS SONS OF IROQUOIS BRAVES FOUGHT THE RAPIDS TRIUMPHED OVER THE RAPIDS AND BROUGHT TO LAND THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE RAGE OF WATERS
THE SUREST TIME OF YEAR TO FIND THE PILOTS AT HOME IS THE WINTER SEASON FOR THEN WITH NAVIGATION FROZEN UP THEY HAVE WEEKS TO SPEND DRIFTING ALONG IN THE SLEEPY VILLAGE LIFE WAITING FOR THE SPRING
BECAUSE THE MOMENT THE SUN'S RAYS ARE WITHDRAWN THE HEAT IS RAPIDLY RADIATED BY THE BLADES OF GRASS WHICH COOLS THE EARTH UNDER IT AND THE AIR ABOVE AND SURROUNDING IT SO THAT IF THE AIR IS ANYWHERE NEAR THE MOISTURE SATURATION POINT
THE CHANNEL OF THE RIVER PASSING DOWN THROUGH WHAT IS NOW THE BOTTOM OF LAKE MICHIGAN WHICH HAD AN OUTLET AT THE HEAD OF THE LAKE NEAR CHICAGO AND FLOWED OFF INTO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ALL OF THE LAKE BOTTOMS OF THIS GREAT CHAIN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LAKE ERIE
SO TRUE IS THIS THAT IT IS NEVER SAFE TO PLAN A PICNIC FOR TO MORROW BASED UPON THE PREDICTIONS OF TO DAY THE CHIEF DIFFICULTY IN THE WAY OF SOLVING THE GREAT PROBLEMS RELATING TO THE SUDDEN CHANGES IN THE WEATHER AND TEMPERATURE
ALTHOUGH THEY OCCUR SOMETIMES IN APRIL JUNE AND JULY
NEW MOLECULES ARE FORMED AND A NEW SUBSTANCE IS THE RESULT
WHEREAS IN THE CASE OF THE DARK CLOUD THE LIGHT IS LARGELY ABSORBED THERE IS A SORT OF NOTION PREVAILING THAT CLOUDS COME UP FROM THE HORIZON AND IN MANY CASES THEY DO BUT THEY MAY FORM DIRECTLY OVER OUR HEADS
CHAPTER FOURTEEN HOW DEW IS FORMED READER DID YOU EVER LIVE IN THE COUNTRY WERE YOU EVER AWAKENED EARLY ON A SUMMER'S MORNING TO GO FOR THE COWS DID YOU EVER WADE THROUGH A WHEAT FIELD IN JUNE
WE CAN READILY SEE FROM WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE THAT A CLOUD THUS FORMED HAVING A DEFINITE DENSITY AND WEIGHT WOULD FLOAT HIGHER SOME DAYS THAN OTHERS ASSUMING AGAIN THAT THE DENSITY OF THE AIR REMAINS THE SAME FROM DAY TO DAY
THE BIG SANDY THE KANAWHA THE HOCKING AND THE GREAT BEAVER BESIDES NUMEROUS SMALLER STREAMS HAVE THEIR OWN VALLEYS THAT HAVE BEEN WORN AWAY BY THE SAME PROCESS AND TO A GREATER DEPTH THAN THEY NOW APPEAR TO BE
AND THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN ON THE SOUTH THERE ARE OTHER CHANGES CONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE IN ALL SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHILE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE OF SEASONS AND THE GRADUAL CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE THAT WOULD NATURALLY FOLLOW
THEY ARE SO HOT AND DRY THAT GREEN LEAVES AND GRASS ARE RENDERED AS DRY AS POWDER IN A FEW MINUTES THESE WINDS ARE PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR WHEN THE PREVAILING WIND IS SOUTHWESTERLY
THE READING OF A SINGLE BAROMETER ALONE WILL GIVE US BUT A FAINT IDEA OF WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN FROM DAY TO DAY
AND WHEN ONCE SATURATED WITH HEAT IS SLOW TO GIVE IT UP
THIS LAKE RECEDES MANY FEET DURING THE SUMMER BUT IT IS AGAIN FILLED UP BY THE RAINS AND SNOWS OF WINTER THERE IS NO CONSIDERABLE STREAM EITHER FLOWING INTO OR OUT FROM IT IT IS A LAKE FORMED BY THE GLACIERS
IS DISTRIBUTED OVER A CUBIC FOOT OF SPACE THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT TAKES PLACE WHEN HEATED AIR AT THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WHICH IS CONDENSED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RISES TO THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THERE IS A GRADUAL EXPANSION AS IT ASCENDS
THE LOWER CURRENTS BEING CALLED THE LOWER TRADES THESE UPPER TRADES GRADUALLY FALL TILL THEY REACH THE TROPIC OF CANCER ON THE NORTH WHERE THE LOWER PART OF THE CURRENT STOPS AND BENDS BACK TOWARD THE EQUATOR NOW BECOMING A PART OF THE LOWER TRADE WIND
WHICH IS PRESSING ON IT WITH A FORCE OF FIFTEEN POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH AT SEA LEVEL WHEN AIR IS HEATED IT EXPANDS AND AS IT EXPANDS IT GROWS LIGHTER THE STRATUM LYING UPON THE EARTH AS SOON AS IT BECOMES HEATED MOVES UPWARD
THIS IS TRUE AT LEAST AS A BASIS FOR CHEMICAL SCIENCE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE GOLD ANYTHING BUT GOLD OR OXYGEN ANYTHING BUT OXYGEN AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE CATALOGUE OF ELEMENTS IT MAY BE HOWEVER
AND DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE BETWEEN TWO POINTS USUALLY MEANS A PROPORTIONAL DIFFERENCE IN THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND THERE IS A TIME IN THE FALL AND SPRING WHILE THERE IS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE LAND AND WATER FOR SUPREMACY WHEN THE WINDS ARE VARIABLE
IS SIMPLY A MIXTURE OF THESE TWO GASES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIXTURE AND A COMPOUND IN A MIXTURE THERE IS NO CHEMICAL CHANGE IN THE MOLECULES OF THE SUBSTANCES MIXED IN A COMPOUND
FORMING ON ONE OR BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER LEVEL AREAS CALLED BOTTOM LAND THESE LANDS ARE EXCEEDINGLY PRODUCTIVE OWING TO THE GREAT DEPTH AND RICHNESS OF THE SOIL FOR MANY YEARS THE WRITER LIVED UPON ONE OF THE RIVERS TRIBUTARY TO THE OHIO
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL AREA HERETOFORE NOTED CHIEFLY IN WISCONSIN BECAME COVERED WITH ONE VAST SHEET OF ICE THE GLACIER NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR WIDENED OUT THE OLD RIVER BED BY A PROCESS OF EROSION TO ITS PRESENT WIDTH
BUT IF THE NIGHT IS CLOUDY THERE WILL BE LITTLE OR NO DEW FORMED THE CLOUDS FORM A SCREEN BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH PREVENTS THE HEAT FROM RADIATING TO A SUFFICIENT EXTENT TO FORM DEW
WHEN THE AIR IS CHARGED WITH THIS VAPOR TO THE POINT OF SATURATION WHICH POINT VARIES WITH THE TEMPERATURE A SLIGHT DEPRESSION OF THE TEMPERATURE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONDENSE THIS VAPOR INTO CLOUD OR DROPS OF WATER
SOUTHERN WISCONSIN AND MINNESOTA ARE DUE ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE GREAT DEPOSITS OF GLACIAL DRIFT THAT HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED WITH THE ICE WHEREVER THESE KETTLE HOLES ARE FOUND LARGE BODIES OF ICE HAVE BECOME ANCHORED
AND CONSEQUENTLY A GRADUAL COOLING BECAUSE A GIVEN AMOUNT OF HEAT IS BEING CONSTANTLY DISTRIBUTED OVER A GREATER AMOUNT OF SPACE AT AN ALTITUDE OF FORTY FIVE MILES IT WILL HAVE EXPANDED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TIMES
THE VALLEY OF THE OHIO RIVER WILL PROBABLY AVERAGE A MILE IN WIDTH AT ITS UPPER LEVEL AND DEEP AS IT IS TO DAY IT WAS MUCH DEEPER IN PREGLACIAL TIMES THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE WHOLE BED OF THE RIVER
THIS SUBJECT HOWEVER WILL BE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY UNDER THE HEAD OF EVAPORATION THE AIR AT SEA LEVEL WEIGHS FIFTEEN POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH AND IF THE WHOLE ENVELOPE OF AIR WERE HOMOGENEOUS THE SAME IN CHARACTER
BUT FROM THE FACT THAT RADIANT ENERGY CAN BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH IT WITH VIBRATIONS AMOUNTING TO BILLIONS PER SECOND WE KNOW THAT IT MUST BE A SUBSTANCE WITH ELASTIC QUALITIES THAT APPROACH THE INFINITE ASSUMING THAT THE ETHER IS A SUBSTANCE THE QUESTION ARISES
IN THIS WAY THE PROCESS OF EVAPORATION IS CARRIED ON VERY RAPIDLY AND THE HEAT IS EXTRACTED FROM THE WATER TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT FREEZES OFTEN FORMING ICE IN ONE NIGHT OVER AN INCH IN THICKNESS AND THIS IN THE HOTTEST CLIMATES ON THE GLOBE
WE WILL SPEAK OF IT ONLY IN ITS RELATION TO AQUEOUS MOISTURE THE HEAT THAT IS IMPARTED TO THE EARTH'S SURFACE BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN IS ABLE TO SEPARATE WATER INTO MINUTE PARTICLES WHICH WHEN SO SEPARATED
AND IS EQUALLY SLOW TO GIVE UP THE HEAT AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT AFTER THE SUN HAS SET THE LAND COOLS SO MUCH FASTER THAN THE WATER THAT WE SOON HAVE THE OPPOSITE CONDITION AND THE SEA IS WARMER THAN THE LAND WHICH MAKES THE AIR AT THAT POINT LIGHTER
LEAVING THE SALT FORMING ONE OF THE IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES OF THAT REGION ALL OF THE RIVERS FROM THE OHIO EASTWARD TELL THE SAME STORY WHICH IS THAT AT SOME REMOTE PERIOD THE LAND WAS MUCH HIGHER ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA THAN IT IS TO DAY
WILL NOT SEND UP AS MUCH VAPOR FROM A GIVEN AREA IN SQUARE MILES AS AN EQUAL AREA OF LAND WILL DO WHEN IT IS SATURATED WITH MOISTURE FOR THE REASON THAT THERE IS A MUCH LARGER EVAPORATING SURFACE ON A SQUARE MILE OF LAND
WHAT IS THE FINAL DESTINY OF THE EARTH THAT NOW APPEARS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN EVIDENTLY IF THE EARTH SHOULD REMAIN WITHOUT FURTHER UPHEAVAL
IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY METEOROLOGISTS THAT THE AMOUNT OF WATER CONDENSED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IN THE FORM OF DEW AMOUNTS TO AS MUCH AS FIVE INCHES OR ABOUT ONE SEVENTH OF THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE THAT IS EVAPORATED INTO THE AIR
TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IN A SHORT TIME THE WATER WILL BE FROZEN IN HOT COUNTRIES ICE IS MANUFACTURED ON A LARGE SCALE UPON THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE HAVE JUST DESCRIBED WATER IS PUT INTO SHALLOW BASINS
AND THE CLOUDS PRECEDE THE RAIN HENCE ALL THE ARTIFICIAL ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE RAIN IN THESE ARID REGIONS HAVE BEEN FUTILE IF A BODY OF WARM AIR WHEN SATURATED WITH INVISIBLE MOISTURE
AND ONE HALF PER CENT IS CHIEFLY CARBON DIOXIDE CARBON DIOXIDE IS A PRODUCT OF COMBUSTION DECAY AND ANIMAL EXHALATION IT IS POISON TO THE ANIMAL BUT FOOD FOR THE VEGETABLE HOWEVER THE PROPORTION IN THE AIR IS SO SMALL
FORTUNATELY THEY COME IN NARROW STREAKS AND IN MOST CASES DO NOT BLOW MORE THAN FROM TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES AT A TIME THESE HOT BELTS ARE SOMETIMES NOT OVER ONE HUNDRED FEET WIDE AND AGAIN THEY ARE AS MUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED
AND IN A MEASURE PREVENT THE HEAT FROM RADIATING FROM THE EARTH IMMEDIATELY UNDER IT FROST WHICH OF COURSE IS BUT FROZEN DEW AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR WILL FORM ON A STILL AUTUMN NIGHT
THERE ARE TWO OTHER REGIONS OF CALMS IN THE OCEAN ONE AT THE NORTH AT THE TROPIC OF CANCER AND ANOTHER AT THE SOUTH NEAR THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN AS HAS BEEN STATED THERE ARE CURRENTS FLOWING BACK IN THE UPPER REGIONS AT THE EQUATOR NORTH AND SOUTH AND THESE ARE CALLED THE UPPER TRADES
PURG'D FROM THE POND'ROUS DREGS OF EARTH BELOW BY INTERPLANETARY SPACE WE MEAN ALL SPACE BETWEEN THE PLANETS NOT OCCUPIED BY SENSIBLE MATERIAL IT IS THE SAME AS INTERATOMIC SPACE OR THE SPACE BETWEEN ATOMS EXCEPT IN DEGREE
WILL GO TO THE PIANO AND GIVE THE CHILD A DOSE OF HIAWATHA IF A SMALL BOY GOES SWIMMING AND CATCHES A COLD IN HIS HEAD AND IS DOWN WITH A FEVER HIS NURSE AN EXPERT ON THE ACCORDION
YOU TELL YOUR CHILDREN NEVER TO WHISTLE UNTIL THEY ARE OUT OF THE WOODS NOW WHERE IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT'S LOVELY SHOULD A BOY WHISTLE IF NOT IN THE WOODS
SUPPOSE THEY HAD PUT THE THING RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING AND SAID IT'S A LONG LANE THAT HAS NO ENDING WHAT'S THE USE OF PUTTING A THING LIKE THAT IN A COPY BOOK
OUTSIDE OF THAT MYSTERIOUS REALM WHICH IS BOUNDED BY THE FOUR CORNERS OF YOUR OWN BRIGHT PARTICULAR CEREBELLUM WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE MUSIC CURE WHY THE PAPERS HAVE BEEN FULL OF IT LATELY EXPLAINED THE IDIOT
THAT WAS ONE INSTANCE TWO WEEKS LATER I WENT AGAIN THIS TIME TO HEAR GOETTERDAEMMERUNG THE RESULTS WERE THE SAME ONLY THE EFFECT WAS INSTANTANEOUS THE CURTAIN HAD HARDLY RISEN BEFORE I RETIRED TO THE LITTLE ANTE ROOM OF THE BOX OUR PARTY OCCUPIED
IT WAS TRUE THE GREAT AUDITORIUM WAS EMPTY AND WAS GRADUALLY DARKENING I PUT ON MY HAT AND WALKED OUT REFRESHED HAVING SLEPT FROM FIVE TWENTY UNTIL TWELVE OR SIX HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES STRAIGHT
OR IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING YOUR BOY BROUGHT UP TO THE STRENUOUS LIFE WHY DON'T YOU HAVE HIM MAKE SIXTY COPIES OF THE APHORISM A PUNCH IN THE SOLAR IS WORTH SIX ON THE NOSE
THAT LEFT THE PARENT TREE AND SWATTED SIR ISAAC NEWTON ON THE NOSE AND THE DRUG STORES WILL BE DRIVEN OUT OF BUSINESS I PRESUME SAID THE DOCTOR NO SAID THE IDIOT THEY WILL SUBSTITUTE MUSIC FOR DRUGS THAT IS ALL
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT ASKED THE IDIOT ONLY FAINTLY SAID THE POET I THINK YOU READ IT TO ME ONCE BEFORE JUST AFTER YOU ER AH RATHER JUST AFTER ALFRED AUSTIN BIGGS OF TEXAS WROTE IT THE IDIOT LAUGHED
AND MORE ESPECIALLY A WOMAN THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT I KNOW OF CAN GET IT OUT OF THE SYSTEM I GRANT YOU THAT IT IS AS MUCH OF A DISEASE AS SCARLET TYPHOID OR ANY OTHER BUT THE MIND HAS NOT YET BEEN DISCOVERED THAT CAN FIND A REMEDY FOR IT SHORT OF ABJECT POVERTY
WROTE IN HIS MESSAGE TO POSTERITY OH WHEN YOU COME TO CROWN MY BROW BRING ME NO BAY NOR SORREL GIVE ME NO PARSLEY WREATH BUT JUST THE LEGAL LONG GREEN LAUREL I NEVER HEARD THAT POEM BEFORE LAUGHED THE POET
THINK OF THE GLORY OF WINNING A GOAL WHICH SUSTAINS THE FOOTBALL PLAYER THROUGH THE TOUGHEST OF FIGHTS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE NATION WILL RING WITH ITS PLAUDITS OF HIS GALLANT ACHIEVEMENT IS HALF THE BACKING OF YOUR QUARTER BACK THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID THE IDIOT
WHY NOT ADAPT THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS TO MODERN CONDITIONS
THAT'S A FAIR DIVISION BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO MY PROPOSITION WELL IT'S CERTAINLY ER CHEEKY ENOUGH SAID THE POET DO I UNDERSTAND IT YOU WANT ME TO FATHER YOUR POEMS TO TELL THE TRUTH
ANY OLD THING AS LONG AS IT RUNS SMOOTHLY REPLIED THE IDIOT ONLY THE POEMS MUST FIT THE TITLE OF THE BOOK WHICH IS TO BE NOW NOW SAID THE POET NOW REPEATED THE IDIOT
PERHAPS THAT GIGANTIC INTELLECT OF YOURS HAS SOMETHING TO SUGGEST SNEERED THE DOCTOR CERTAINLY QUOTH THE IDIOT I DREAMED IT ALL OUT IN MY SLEEP LAST NIGHT I DREAMED THAT YOU AND I TOGETHER HAD STARTED A SERIES OF ESTABLISHMENTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
COME A TUMBLING TO THE EARTH WITH DEADLY THUD AND FROM ALL OF THIS WE LEARN THE LESSON SWEET THE SOFT MESSAGE OF DAME NATURE GRAND AND CLEAR THAT THE WINTER TIME IS GONE WITH STORM AND SLEET
THERE'LL BE A HOT TIME IN THE OLD TOWN TO NIGHT WILL BECOME AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY FOR A SUDDEN CHILL PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM SLEEPLESSNESS CAN DOSE THEMSELVES BACK TO NORMAL CONDITIONS WITH WAGNER THE WAY I DID TCHAIKOWSKY
A COLLEGE PRESIDENT MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT BOYS WILL PLAY FOOTBALL AND THAT THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO STAVE OFF THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF PLAYING THE GAME TO ONE WHO ISN'T PREPARED FOR IT YOU KNOW AS WELL AS ANYBODY ELSE THAT FROM NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH TO DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH
I SEE YOU'RE ON HE SAID ANYHOW IT'S GOOD SENTIMENT WHETHER I WROTE IT OR BIGGS FACT IS IN MY JUDGMENT WHAT THE POET OF TO DAY OUGHT TO DO IS TO COLLECT THE LONG GREEN FROM THE PRESENT AND THE LAUREL FROM POSTERITY
EVEN SO GREAT A MASTERPIECE AS THAT WON'T MAKE A BOOK SAID THE POET OF COURSE IT WON'T RETORTED THE IDIOT THAT'S ONLY FOR THE SUMMER HERE'S ANOTHER ONE ON WINTER JUST LISTEN NOW THE MAN WHO DEALS IN MITTENS AND IN TABS
THAT'S WHERE THE WIND WHISTLES IF NATURE WHISTLES ANYWHERE
UNIMAGINATIVE PEOPLE AND THAT WOULD BE DEATH TO PROGRESS NO PEOPLE CAN PROGRESS THAT LACKS IMAGINATION POLITICS IS AN EMERY WHEEL THAT KEEPS OUR WITS POLISHED WELL
HE PUT OUT THE EYES OF A MAIDEN AUNT WITH A RED HOT POKER AND STABBED A NEGRO COOK IN THE BACK WITH A SKEWER BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO PUT RAT POISON IN HIS GRANDFATHER'S COFFEE
NOW IN THE WRITING LESSONS WHY NOT ADAPT YOUR MEANS TO YOUR ENDS WHY MAKE A BEGINNER IN PENMANSHIP WRITE OVER AND OVER AGAIN A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH WHICH IT ISN'T BY THE WAY
THANKS TO OUR HABIT OF LEAVING EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE YOU KNOW THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN IN YOUR CARE UNLESS THEY HAVE PROPERLY TRAINED FOR THE EXIGENCIES OF THE EPIDEMIC PERIOD WILL BE PROSTRATED PHYSICALLY AND NERVOUSLY RACKED IN BONE AND BODY ACHING FROM TIP TO TOE
HE DISCUSSES THE MUSIC CURE GOOD MORNING DOCTOR SAID THE IDIOT AS CAPSULE M D ENTERED THE DINING ROOM I AM MIGHTY GLAD YOU'VE COME
WELL SAID THE IDIOT THERE'S ONE AND IT'S THE NERVIEST OF EM ALL
A STITCH IN TIME SAVES NOTHING AT ALL AT PRESENT TAILORS RATES YOU LOOK AFTER THE PENNIES SOMEBODY ELSE WILL DEPOSIT THE POUNDS IT'S A LONG HEIRESS THAT KNOWS NO YEARNING
I SOMETIMES WONDER DOCTOR THAT YOU GENTLEMEN WHO HAVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH MORE OR LESS IN YOUR HANDS DON'T TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND STAVE OFF NERVOUS PROSTRATION AND OTHER ILLS ATTENDANT UPON A RUN DOWN PHYSICAL CONDITION INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR A FULLY DEVELOPED CASE
THEN YOU CAN HAVE A BLANKET VERSE HE SAID SCRIBBLING WITH HIS PENCIL ON A PIECE OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND AS TIME GOES ON A STALKING AND THE IDIOT STILL IS TALKING
THE FIRST INSTANCE THAT I CAN RECALL IS THAT OF A WAGNER OPERA AND ITS EFFECTS UPON ME FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL FROM INSOMNIA I COULD NOT GET TWO HOURS OF CONSECUTIVE SLEEP AND THE EFFECT OF MY SUFFERINGS WAS TO MAKE ME NERVOUS AND IRRITABLE
I SAT DOWN ON THE TEACHER'S GLASS OF WATER THAT'S THE SORT OF THING SECOND THOUGHT DOES IN THE MATTER OF MORALS I ADMIT OF COURSE THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN SECOND THOUGHTS ARE BETTER THAN FIRST ONES FOR INSTANCE IF YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS TO NAME THE BABY JIMMIE AND JIMMIE TURNS OUT TO BE A GIRL
THAN IN THE ORIGINAL MODEL THE LEG THAT'S NEVER PULLED DOESN'T GO SHORT IN A STRINGENT FINANCIAL MARKET AND A COURTSHIP WITHOUT A KISS EVEN IF IT LASTED ONLY FIVE MINUTES
WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER THEM IN REAL LIFE AS THEY SURELY MUST WHEN THE HOLIDAY SEASON IS IN FULL BLAST AND THEY ARE COMPELLED BY THE DEMANDS OF THE HOUR TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD THE WOMEN COULDN'T STAND IT SAID THE DOCTOR THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE KNOCKED OUT AT THE REAL THING AS IN THE IMITATION
I WENT TO BED LAST NIGHT AT HALF AFTER SEVEN AND NEVER WAKED UNTIL NINE THIS MORNING IN SPITE OF ALL THAT SLEEP AND REST I FEEL NOW AS IF I'D BEEN PUT THROUGH A THRESHING MACHINE EVERY BONE IN MY BODY FROM THE FUNNY TO THE MEDULLA ACHES LIKE ALL POSSESSED
IT'S PREPOSTEROUS ON THE FACE OF IT SAID MISTER BIB WELL THAT'S THE WAY THE THING WORKS SAID THE IDIOT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF BULLY GOOD FUN TO BE HAD OUT OF A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN
ON THE WILLIEBOYS THAT CHANCE ALONG HER WAY NOW THE SKEETER SINGS HIS CAROLS TO THE DAWN AND BEWAILS THE EARLY CLOSING OF THE BAR THAT PREVENTS THE LITTLE NIPS HE SEEKS EACH MORN
SECOND THOUGHTS ARE ALWAYS SECOND PROCRASTINATION IS THE THEME OF GOSSIPS NEVER PUT OFF TO DAY WHAT YOU CAN PUT ON DAY AFTER TO MORROW
TO ERADICATE THE SHOPPING EVIL LAUGHED THE DOCTOR A SORT OF KEELEY CURE FOR SHOPPING INEBRIATES NAY NAY RETORTED THE IDIOT THE SHOPPING INEBRIATE IS TOO MUCH OF A FACTOR IN OUR COMMERCIAL PROSPERITY TO MAKE SUCH A THING AS THAT POPULAR
BUT THE MAKE UP OF THE AVERAGE WOMAN IS SUCH THAT WHAT PURSUIT OF FAME DOES FOR THE GLADIATOR THE CHASE AFTER A BARGAIN DOES FOR A WOMAN I HAVE KNOWN WOMEN SO WORN AND WEARY THAT THEY COULDN'T GET UP FOR BREAKFAST WHO HAD A LION'S STRENGTH AN HOUR LATER
AND EVEN THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO FAIL THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH SAID THE IDIOT
ALONG CERTAIN LINES HAS GOT THE LAST AND BEST END OF IT AND SO IT GOES
OUGHT TO BE WARNED BEFOREHAND YOU WOULDN'T YOURSELF RENT A FURNISHED RESIDENCE TO A MAN WHOSE CHILDREN WERE KNOWN TO HAVE BUILT BONFIRES IN THE PARLOR OF THEIR LAST KNOWN HOME WOULD YOU I THINK NOT SMILED THE BIBLIOMANIAC
HE EXPERIENCED THE MISERY OF A MAN BELIEVING THAT NO HUMAN BEING CARED A STRAW WHETHER HE SHOULD LIVE OR DIE ANY SYMPATHY SHOWN TO HIM WAS UPON THE SCORE OF RELATIONSHIP
SO LONG AS I GET RID OF THIS IRISH CURSE WHO HAS POISONED EVERY HOUR OF MY EXISTENCE IF TRUE TO HIS PROMISE HE TAKES THE ROUTE TO HIS HOME BY AN EARLY HOUR IN THE MORNING WHAT TIME I WONDER
THAT UPON THE HEAD THUS SEEN THERE WAS A HAT A BLACK GLAZE SOMBRERO OF THE MEXICAN SORT WITH A BAND OF GOLD BULLION ABOVE THE BRIM THERE WERE STILL FURTHER SPECULATIONS THAT RELATED LESS TO THE APPARITION ITSELF THAN TO ITS CONNECTION WITH THE OTHER GRAND TOPIC OF THE TIME
WITH THE MENTAL AND CORPOREAL EXCITEMENT LONG SUSTAINED DID NOT FAIL TO PRODUCE ITS EFFECT AND THE MIND OF MAURICE GERALD ONCE MORE RETURNED TO ITS DELIRIOUS DREAMING
YOU ARE BY JESUS CHRIST AND GENERAL JACKSON YOU'RE NOT VERY POLITE COUSIN CASH THOUGH AFTER THE LANGUAGE I'VE BEEN LATELY USING MYSELF I MIGHT EXCUSE YOU PERHAPS YOU WILL ONE DAY IMITATE ME
HE DID NOT DECLARE THE EXACT CAUSE OF IT BUT CALHOUN COULD GUESS BY CERTAIN INNUENDOS INTRODUCED DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT IT WAS THE SAME AS THAT BY WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ACTUATED
IF NOT IT MAY STILL REMAIN A SECRET BETWEEN BROTHER AND MYSELF I THINK I CAN MANAGE HENRY BUT WHY IS HE STILL ABSENT I'VE SATE UP ALL NIGHT WAITING FOR HIM HE MUST HAVE OVERTAKEN MAURICE AND THEY HAVE FRATERNISED I HOPE SO
THEIR ATTITUDES TOLD OF THEIR READINESS TO ENTER IT AND THAT THEY WERE ONLY RESTRAINED BY WAITING FOR SOME PRECONCERTED SIGNAL THAT THEIR PURPOSE WAS A SERIOUS ONE COULD BE DEDUCED FROM SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES
COVARUBIO DE LOS LLANOS AS THE SPIRIT OF THE UNHAPPY SENORITA PASSED INTO ETERNITY
CALHOUN STOOD UPON THE STONES TILL THE FOOTFALL OF THE HORSE BECAME BUT FAINTLY DISTINGUISHABLE IN THE DISTANCE THEN AS IF ACTING UNDER SOME SUDDEN IMPULSE HE HURRIED ALONG THE VERANDAH TO HIS OWN ROOM
BUT CAPTAIN CALHOUN PURSUED HANCOCK YOUR ADVERSARY HAS NO KNIFE IF YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO MEET HIM ON EQUAL TERMS YOU SHOULD SURRENDER YOURS CERTAINLY HE SHOULD CRIED SEVERAL OF THE BYSTANDERS HE MUST HE MUST
AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT SHOWS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN THEGITHER THE ANIMALS IT MIGHT BE RESTLESS AND MOVIN ABOUT AS FOR THE TIME THEY'VE TAKEN LONG ENOUGH TO SMOKE A CIGAR APIECE CLOSE TO THE TEETH TOO HERE ARE THE STUMPS NOT ENOUGH LEFT TO FILL A FELLOW'S PIPE
CONTINUES HE I NEEDN'T THAT I INTENDED TO KILL SOME ONE I DID NOR AM I GOING TO DENY WHO IT WAS IT WAS THE CUR I SEE STANDING BEFORE ME IN A GLANCE OF CONCENTRATED HATRED
AT THE SAME TIME WHISKING HIS SABRE OUT OF ITS SCABBARD AND INTERPOSING ITS LONG BLADE BETWEEN THE DISPUTANTS HOLD YOUR FIRE I COMMAND YOU BOTH DROP YOUR MUZZLES OR BY THE ALMIGHTY I'LL TAKE THE ARM OFF THE FIRST OF YOU THAT TOUCHES TRIGGER
AND GOD KNOWS I WAS SORRY ENOUGH ON DISCOVERING THAT I HAD MADE IT I DIDN'T KNOW MYSELF TILL LONG AFTER THE CONDEMNED MAN LOOKS UP AS IF IN HOPES THAT HE HAS TOUCHED A CHORD OF MERCY
IT WAS NOT THE BATTERIE OF SMALL ARMS THAT KEPT ZEB STUMP FROM SHOWING HIMSELF HE HAD NO DREAD OF AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE EX OFFICER OF VOLUNTEERS THOUGH HE INSTINCTIVELY FELT HOSTILITY HE HAD AS YET GIVEN NO REASON TO THE LATTER FOR REGARDING HIM AS AN ENEMY
THE OUTSIDE WORLD BUT KNEW THAT CAPTAIN CASSIUS CALHOUN AND MIGUEL DIAZ
YOU WOULD BECOME THE RECIPIENT OF A HOSPITALITY UNEQUALLED IN EUROPEAN LANDS YOU WOULD HAVE FOR YOUR HOST ONE OF THE HANDSOMEST MEN IN TEXAS FOR YOUR HOSTESS ONE OF ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
NOR THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS HEIGHTENED ON LEARNING FROM THE ASTONISHED SPECTATORS HOW HER LOVER'S LIFE HAD BEEN PRESERVED AS IT MIGHT SEEM MIRACULOUSLY THE AIM OF THE ASSASSIN
SHOW YOU THE STOCK AND NEVER TIRE OF TALKING ABOUT THE HUNDREDS AY THOUSANDS OF HORSES AND HORNED CATTLE SEEN ROAMING OVER THE PASTURES OF THE PLANTATION
THE ASTUTE MISSISSIPPIAN KNEW BETTER THAN TO DECLARE HIS ULTIMATE DESIGNS TO A STRANGER WHO AFTER COMPLETING AN ADVANTAGEOUS HORSE TRADE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH WHATEVER HE CHOSE TO DRINK
INTERPOSED ITS VERDANT VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE EX CAPTAIN OF CAVALRY THE BACKWOODSMAN'S BRAIN HAVING BECOME THE RECIPIENT OF NEW THOUGHTS REQUIRED A FRESH EXERCISE OF ITS INGENUITY IF THERE WAS REASON BEFORE FOR TAKING THE TRAIL OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN IT WAS REDOUBLED NOW
IS HE ABOUT TO UNBURDEN HIS CONSCIENCE OF THE WEIGHT THAT MUST BE ON IT THE SPECTATORS GUESSING HIS INTENTION STAND BREATHLESSLY OBSERVING HIM THERE IS SILENCE EVEN AMONG THE CICADAS
IN A JAIL WHERE HE WAS SCARCE CARED FOR AT ALL WHEN AGAIN RESTORED TO CONSCIOUSNESS IT WAS TO DISCOVER THAT THE FAIR VISION OF HIS DREAMS WAS NO VISION AT ALL BUT A LOVELY WOMAN
ENOUGH CRIED THE YOUNG IRISHMAN FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWING SERIOUS ANGER I GAVE HIM A CHANCE FOR HIS LIFE HE REFUSES TO ACCEPT IT AND NOW BY THE MOTHER OF GOD WE DON'T BOTH LEAVE THIS ROOM ALIVE
HE MUST HAVE BEEN OUT ALL NIGHT OR VERY EARLY ACCORDING TO THE NIGGER'S ACCOUNT AT THE PORT I SUPPOSE WITH THOSE YOUNG FELLOWS NOT AT THE TAVERN I HOPE OH NO HE WOULDN'T GO THERE INTERPOSED CALHOUN WHO APPEARED AS MUCH MYSTIFIED BY THE ABSENCE OF HENRY
AFTER WHAT I'VE CONFESSED IT WOULD BE FOLLY IN ME TO EXPECT PARDON AND I DON'T I'VE BEEN A BAD FELLOW AND NO DOUBT HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO DESERVE MY FATE BUT BAD AS I MAY HAVE BEEN
THE INDIANS WERE OUT AND NEAR AT HAND REAPING THEIR HARVEST OF SCALPS THAT OF YOUNG POINDEXTER WAS THE FIRSTFRUITS OF THEIR SANGUINARY GLEANING
NEER A MIND I'D MAKE HIM TAKE HIS FULL SHARE O THE CARRYIN WHEN IT KUM TO THET HOW AIR IT TO BE DONE WE MUST GIT HIM ON A STREETCHER
BY THE TARNAL THUR'S SOMETHIN GOED ASTRAY EF TWA'NT THAT I FEEL A PUTTY CONSID'ABLE SMARTIN WHAR THE YOUNG FELLUR GIN ME A LICK OVER THE LEFT EYE
SINCE HE HAS GONE ASTRAY IN GOOD COMPANY HOW FAR THE STRING OF REFLECTIONS MIGHT HAVE EXTENDED IT IS NOT EASY TO SAY SINCE IT DID NOT REACH ITS NATURAL ENDING IT WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE REAPPEARANCE OF PLUTO WHOSE IMPORTANT AIR AS HE RE ENTERED THE ROOM
THERE IS NO SIGN OF IT ON THE FACES THAT SURROUND HIM STILL SOLEMNLY AUSTERE
WHITHER THE COMBATANTS WHO HAD GONE OUT BY SEPARATE DOORS HAD ALREADY PRECEDED HIM OLD DUFFER LEFT STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS SANDED FLOOR
MORE'N WAR WROTE INSIDE I RECK'N BEEN USED FOR THE WAD O A GUN
A CIRCUMFERENCE OF TWENTY MILES WILL INCLUDE THE DIFFERENT POINTS WHERE THE SPECTRAL APPARITION MADE ITSELF MANIFEST TO THE EYES OF MEN BOTH ON PRAIRIE AND IN CHAPPARAL IN A DISTRICT OF COUNTRY TRAVERSED BY SEVERAL NORTHERN TRIBUTARIES OF THE RIO DE NUECES
FLORINDA NOW THE BETTER HALF OF HIS LIFE HAS EFFECTED THE TRANSFORMATION
THE CROWD CLOSES AROUND BELIEVING BOTH TO BE DEAD
COUSIN HE'D DO THAT OR ANY OTHER VILLINOUS THING EF THERE WAR A REEZUN FOR IT THERE AIN'T NONE AS I KIN THINK O
NOT ONE OF WHICH MIGHT COME WITHIN A THOUSAND MILES OF THE TRUTH SUCH A HORSE AND JUST SUCH A RIDER WERE SEEN UPON THE PRAIRIES OF SOUTH WESTERN TEXAS IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD EIGHTEEN FIFTY SOMETHING
TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE EMBOUCHURE OF THE AVENUE IT RAN INTO IT AND FIFTY PACES FURTHER ON
THIS HOWEVER WAS ATTENDED TO BY THE YOUNGER OFFICERS WHO AT ONCE SET ABOUT ARRANGING THE CONDITIONS OF THE DUEL THERE WAS NOT MUCH TIME CONSUMED THE TERMS HAD BEEN EXPRESSED ALREADY
CLOSE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE SPINE
THE MASTER OF EVERY CROWD THAT MIGHT GATHER AROUND HIM HE COULD NO LONGER CLAIM THIS CREDIT IN TEXAS AND THE THOUGHT HARROWED HIS HEART TO ITS VERY CORE
AND SOME SOUTHERN BRANCHES OF THE RIO LEONA IT WAS SEEN NOT ONLY BY MANY PEOPLE BUT AT MANY DIFFERENT TIMES
AND STAYED SOME TIME IN THE SAME PLACE UNDER THE BRANCHES OF A SPREADING COTTONWOOD THE TURF MUCH TRAMPLED AROUND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE WAS EVIDENCE OF THIS THE TRACKER GOT OFF HIS HORSE TO EXAMINE IT AND STOOPING TO THE EARTH CAREFULLY SCRUTINISED THE SIGN
