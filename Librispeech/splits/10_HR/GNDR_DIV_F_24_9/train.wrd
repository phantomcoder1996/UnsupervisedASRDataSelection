HE HAD ADMIRED THE ASSURANCE OF HIS LOOK AND THE FIRMNESS OF HIS VOICE BUT AT THESE WORDS SO NATURAL IN THEMSELVES YOUR FATHER IS INDEED HERE AND IS SEEKING YOU YOUNG ANDREA STARTED AND EXCLAIMED MY FATHER IS MY FATHER HERE
NEVERTHELESS YOU MUST NOT EXAGGERATE THE EVIL SAID MONTE CRISTO FOR BY ENDEAVORING TO AVOID ONE FAULT YOU WILL FALL INTO ANOTHER YOU MUST RESOLVE UPON ONE SIMPLE AND SINGLE LINE OF CONDUCT
AS FOR ME MY HEART IS OVERFLOWING WITH HAPPINESS HAPPY FATHER HAPPY SON SAID THE COUNT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WHICH GRIEVES ME OBSERVED THE MAJOR AND THAT IS THE NECESSITY FOR MY LEAVING PARIS SO SOON
HE DEPUTES ME TO GIVE YOU THIS AM I TO CONSIDER THIS AS PART OF MY INCOME ON ACCOUNT NO IT IS FOR THE FIRST EXPENSES OF YOUR SETTLING IN PARIS AH HOW GOOD MY DEAR FATHER IS SILENCE SAID MONTE CRISTO
THE MARQUIS WILL GIVE YOU SOME PAPERS WHICH WILL CERTIFY THIS FACT AND AUTHORIZE YOU TO APPEAR UNDER THAT NAME IN THE PARISIAN WORLD
AND HAS HE CONFORMED TO ALL THAT THE LETTER SPECIFIED HE HAS DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT NOT IN THE LEAST THERE IS A DUPE SOMEWHERE AT ALL EVENTS IT IS NEITHER YOU NOR I CERTAINLY NOT WELL THEN
AH YOU MAY LOOK SAID THE DAME IF YOU'RE NOT A GOOD BOY THAT IS HOW YOU SHALL BE SERVED THE DOG SHALL HAVE YOU TO LOOK AFTER I TREMBLED AND WAS SPEECHLESS AFTER SOME FURTHER CONFABULATION MISSUS MITCHELL TOOK HER LEAVE SAYING
AS FOR ME YOU MUST KNOW I CANNOT POSSIBLY LIVE OUT OF LUCCA THEREFORE I SHALL RETURN TO ITALY AS SOON AS I CAN BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE FRANCE MY DEAR FATHER I HOPE YOU WILL PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF THE DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY TO PROVE MY DESCENT
SO LONG AS I DO REMAIN IN PARIS AND NOTHING FORCES ME TO QUIT IT DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT I MAY RELY ON RECEIVING THE SUM YOU JUST NOW MENTIONED TO ME
WHICH IS ONE OF THE SAFEST BANKS IN PARIS AND DOES MY FATHER MEAN TO REMAIN LONG IN PARIS ASKED ANDREA ONLY A FEW DAYS REPLIED MONTE CRISTO HIS SERVICE DOES NOT ALLOW HIM TO ABSENT HIMSELF MORE THAN TWO OR THREE WEEKS TOGETHER AH MY DEAR FATHER
HERE THEY ARE ANDREA SEIZED THE CERTIFICATE OF HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE AND HIS OWN BAPTISMAL REGISTER AND AFTER HAVING OPENED THEM WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS WHICH MIGHT BE EXPECTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES HE READ THEM WITH A FACILITY WHICH PROVED THAT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SIMILAR DOCUMENTS
WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN YOUR MEANING SAID THE MAJOR ENDEAVORING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO ASSUME AN AIR OF THE GREATEST MAJESTY
HE IS A MILLIONAIRE HIS INCOME IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS THEN SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH ANXIETY I SHALL BE SURE TO BE PLACED IN AN AGREEABLE POSITION ONE OF THE MOST AGREEABLE POSSIBLE MY DEAR SIR
WELL MARQUIS SAID MONTE CRISTO YOU APPEAR TO BE IN NO WAY DISAPPOINTED IN THE SON WHOM YOUR GOOD FORTUNE HAS RESTORED TO YOU AH YOUR EXCELLENCY I AM OVERWHELMED WITH DELIGHT AND WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS SAID MONTE CRISTO TURNING TO THE YOUNG MAN
WHO WAS HOBBLING AFTER ME BUT WITH THE RENEWED STRENGTH OF TRIUMPH I TURNED AGAIN FOR HOME AND RAN AS I HAD NEVER RUN BEFORE WHEN OR WHERE THE DAME GAVE IN I DO NOT KNOW
THE YOUNG MAN CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE MAJOR WHO HAD RISEN WHEN HE HEARD STEPS APPROACHING HIM AH MY DEAR FATHER SAID ANDREA IN A LOUD VOICE IN ORDER THAT THE COUNT MIGHT HEAR HIM IN THE NEXT ROOM IS IT REALLY YOU
GO TO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
THEN IN THAT CASE I SHALL ALWAYS CHOOSE TO REMAIN THERE YOU CANNOT CONTROL CIRCUMSTANCES MY DEAR SIR MAN PROPOSES AND GOD DISPOSES ANDREA SIGHED BUT SAID HE
I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM FOR IT WILL BE NECESSARY HE SHOULD KNOW YOU AS HE IS TO PAY YOUR MONEY FULL DRESS SAID THE MAJOR HALF ALOUD OH YES CERTAINLY SAID THE COUNT UNIFORM CROSS KNEE BREECHES AND HOW SHALL I BE DRESSED DEMANDED ANDREA
A DESCENDANT OF THE CAVALCANTI WHOSE NAMES ARE INSCRIBED IN THE GOLDEN BOOK AT FLORENCE OUR FAMILY ALTHOUGH STILL RICH FOR MY FATHER'S INCOME AMOUNTS TO HALF A MILLION HAS EXPERIENCED MANY MISFORTUNES AND I MYSELF WAS AT THE AGE OF FIVE YEARS
MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI AND YOU REALLY MEAN TO SAY MONSIEUR THAT MY DEAR FATHER IS HERE YES SIR AND I CAN EVEN ADD THAT I HAVE ONLY JUST LEFT HIS COMPANY THE HISTORY WHICH HE RELATED TO ME OF HIS LOST SON TOUCHED ME TO THE QUICK
I HEARD WITH HORROR BUT I WAS UP AND OFF IN A MOMENT I HAD NOT HOWEVER GOT MANY YARDS FROM THE COTTAGE BEFORE I HEARD THE VOICE OF THE DAME SCREAMING AFTER ME TO RETURN I TOOK NO HEED ONLY SPED THE FASTER
AS STANDING ON ONE LEG THE OTHER WAS SO MUCH SHORTER SHE MOVED IT TO AND FRO OVER THE GARMENT ON THE TABLE THEN SHE CALLED ME TO HER BY NAME IN A WOULD BE POMPOUS MANNER I OBEYED TREMBLING CAN YOU SAY YOUR LETTERS
A MISERABLE OLD AGE AWAITS YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO BECOME RICH OR AT LEAST INDEPENDENT SET OUT IMMEDIATELY FOR PARIS AND DEMAND OF THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
THE IRONING OF COURSE REQUIRED A FIRE TO MAKE THE IRONS HOT AND AS THE MORNING WENT ON THE SUNSHINE ON THE WALLS CONSPIRING WITH THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH MADE THE PLACE TOO HOT FOR THE COMFORT OF THE OLD DAME SHE WENT AND SET THE DOOR WIDE OPEN
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE EXCUSED IN CONSIDERATION OF THE MISFORTUNES WHICH ACCOMPANIED MY BIRTH AND FOLLOWED ME THROUGH MY YOUTH WELL SAID MONTE CRISTO IN AN INDIFFERENT TONE YOU WILL DO AS YOU PLEASE COUNT FOR YOU ARE THE MASTER OF YOUR OWN ACTIONS AND ARE THE PERSON MOST CONCERNED IN THE MATTER
YOU WOULD BE NO LONGER A LOST CHILD FOUND BUT YOU WOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS AN UPSTART WHO HAD SPRUNG UP LIKE A MUSHROOM IN THE NIGHT YOU MIGHT EXCITE A LITTLE CURIOSITY
I KNEW THAT KIRSTY'S AUTHORITY WAS NOT EQUAL TO HERS AND THAT SHE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO GIVE ME UP SO I WATCHED AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE ONCE MORE AND HIDE MYSELF SO THAT KIRSTY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE I WAS
YOU ARE CHARGED WITH A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION ADDRESSED TO ME ARE YOU NOT SAID THE COUNT I DID NOT MENTION THAT BECAUSE THE SIGNATURE SEEMED TO ME SO STRANGE THE LETTER SIGNED SINBAD THE SAILOR IS IT NOT EXACTLY SO
HE IS A LITTLE STIFF AND POMPOUS IN HIS MANNER AND HE IS DISFIGURED BY HIS UNIFORM BUT WHEN IT BECOMES KNOWN THAT HE HAS BEEN FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS IN THE AUSTRIAN SERVICE ALL THAT WILL BE PARDONED WE ARE NOT GENERALLY VERY SEVERE WITH THE AUSTRIANS
WITH WHICH SHE PROCEEDED TO CHASTISE HIM AS HIS FIRST CRY REACHED MY EARS I WAS HALFWAY TO THE DOOR ON THE THRESHOLD I STUMBLED AND FELL
AND THERE I BURST OUT SOBBING AND CRYING IT WAS ALL THE UTTERANCE I HAD LEFT AS SOON AS KIRSTY HAD SUCCEEDED IN CALMING ME I TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY SHE SAID VERY LITTLE BUT I COULD SEE SHE WAS VERY ANGRY NO DOUBT SHE WAS PONDERING WHAT COULD BE DONE
AND HEREDITARY WORTH AND EVEN TO INCREASE THE VALUE IF POSSIBLE I HAVE THEREFORE RECEIVED A VERY GOOD EDUCATION AND HAVE BEEN TREATED BY THESE KIDNAPPERS VERY MUCH AS THE SLAVES WERE TREATED IN ASIA MINOR WHOSE MASTERS MADE THEM GRAMMARIANS DOCTORS AND PHILOSOPHERS
I WAS INSTANTLY ON THE ALERT WATCHING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY ONE SOON OCCURRED A CLASS OF SOME FIVE OR SIX WAS READING IF READING IT COULD BE CALLED OUT OF THE BIBLE AT LENGTH IT CAME TO THE TURN OF ONE WHO BLUNDERED DREADFULLY
SHOULD YOU LIKE TO BE RICH AND YOUR OWN MASTER MA FOI SAID THE YOUNG MAN WAS IT POSSIBLE THERE COULD BE TWO ANSWERS TO SUCH A QUESTION TAKE THE POST CHAISE WHICH YOU WILL FIND WAITING AT THE PORTE DE GENES AS YOU ENTER NICE
BUT WHAT WAS MY HORROR TO FIND HER COMMAND ENFORCED BY THE PURSUING BARK OF HER PRIME MINISTER THIS PARALYSED ME I TURNED AND THERE WAS THE FIENDISH LOOKING DOG CLOSE ON MY HEELS I COULD RUN NO LONGER
THEY GIVE ME FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR TO BE YOUR SON CONSEQUENTLY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY I SHALL EVER DENY MY PARENT THE MAJOR LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AROUND HIM MAKE YOURSELF EASY WE ARE QUITE ALONE SAID ANDREA
I HOPE NO FALSE REPORT AS FOR MYSELF I FIRST HEARD YOU SPOKEN OF BY MY FRIEND WILMORE THE PHILANTHROPIST I BELIEVE HE FOUND YOU IN SOME UNPLEASANT POSITION BUT DO NOT KNOW OF WHAT NATURE FOR I DID NOT ASK NOT BEING INQUISITIVE
WAS COMPLIMENTARY TO NONE BUT THE TWO WOMEN THEMSELVES MEANTIME I WAS MAKING WHAT OBSERVATIONS MY TERROR WOULD ALLOW ABOUT A DOZEN CHILDREN WERE SEATED ON FORMS ALONG THE WALLS LOOKING OVER THE TOPS OF THEIR SPELLING BOOKS AT THE NEWCOMER
SHE ASKED NOW ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT READ I COULD REPEAT THE ALPHABET HOW I HAD LEARNED IT I DO NOT KNOW I DID REPEAT IT HOW MANY QUESTIONS OF YOUR CATECHISM CAN YOU SAY SHE ASKED NEXT
IN THE FARTHER CORNER TWO WERE KICKING AT EACH OTHER AS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED LOOKING VERY ANGRY BUT NOT DARING TO CRY MY NEXT DISCOVERY WAS TERRIBLY DISCONCERTING SOME MOVEMENT DREW MY EYES TO THE FLOOR THERE I SAW A BOY OF MY OWN AGE ON ALL FOURS
AND HER SKIN WAS GATHERED IN WRINKLES ABOUT HER MOUTH WHERE THEY TWITCHED AND TWITCHED AS IF SHE WERE CONSTANTLY MEDITATING SOMETHING UNPLEASANT SHE LOOKED UP INQUIRINGLY I'VE BROUGHT YOU A NEW SCHOLAR SAID MISSUS MITCHELL WELL VERY WELL
WHEN I HAD FINISHED AND KIRSTY HAD LEFT THE KITCHEN FOR A MOMENT I SPED NOISELESSLY TO THE DOOR AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE FARMYARD THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN DARK AND BROWN AND COOL THE DOOR OF THE BARN STOOD OPEN AS IF INVITING ME TO SHELTER AND SAFETY
BE PLAYING A PART QUITE OUT OF MY LINE AND SHOULD THEREFORE RUN THE RISK OF BEING HISSED WHICH WOULD BE AN ACT OF FOLLY HOWEVER YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID ANDREA IN CONSIDERATION OF LORD WILMORE BY WHOM I WAS RECOMMENDED TO YOU YES CERTAINLY INTERRUPTED MONTE CRISTO
ON CONDITION OF RECEIVING A LARGE SUM OF MONEY BY WAY OF RANSOM YOUR FATHER DID NOT HESITATE AN INSTANT AND THE SUM WAS SENT TO THE FRONTIER OF PIEDMONT WITH A PASSPORT SIGNED FOR ITALY YOU WERE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE I THINK
OH VERY SIMPLY BLACK TROUSERS PATENT LEATHER BOOTS WHITE WAISTCOAT EITHER A BLACK OR BLUE COAT AND A LONG CRAVAT GO TO BLIN OR VERONIQUE FOR YOUR CLOTHES BAPTISTIN WILL TELL YOU WHERE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW THEIR ADDRESS
INDEED HIS GRIEFS HOPES AND FEARS ON THAT SUBJECT MIGHT FURNISH MATERIAL FOR A MOST TOUCHING AND PATHETIC POEM AT LENGTH HE ONE DAY RECEIVED A LETTER STATING THAT THE ABDUCTORS OF HIS SON NOW OFFERED TO RESTORE HIM OR AT LEAST TO GIVE NOTICE WHERE HE MIGHT BE FOUND
SHE WAS AS TALL AS MISSUS MITCHELL AND THAT WAS ENOUGH TO PREJUDICE ME AGAINST HER AT ONCE SHE WORE A CLOSE FITTING WIDOW'S CAP WITH A BLACK RIBBON ROUND IT HER HAIR WAS GREY AND HER FACE WAS AS GREY AS HER HAIR
SAID ANDREA TAKING THE MAJOR BY THE ARM IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER HOW MUCH ARE YOU PAID FOR BEING MY FATHER THE MAJOR WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK WHEN ANDREA CONTINUED IN A LOW VOICE NONSENSE I AM GOING TO SET YOU AN EXAMPLE OF CONFIDENCE
WELL IT IS ONE OF HIS DESCENDANTS AND A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE HE IS A VERY RICH ENGLISHMAN ECCENTRIC ALMOST TO INSANITY AND HIS REAL NAME IS LORD WILMORE AH INDEED THEN THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY SAID ANDREA
YOUR MISFORTUNES ENGAGED HIS SYMPATHIES SO YOU SEE YOU MUST HAVE BEEN INTERESTING HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO RESTORE YOU TO THE POSITION WHICH YOU HAD LOST AND THAT HE WOULD SEEK YOUR FATHER UNTIL HE FOUND HIM HE DID SEEK AND HAS FOUND HIM APPARENTLY SINCE HE IS HERE NOW
AND I AS A DUTIFUL SON AS THEY CHOOSE THAT I SHALL BE DESCENDED FROM YOU WHOM DO YOU MEAN BY THEY MA FOI I CAN HARDLY TELL BUT I WAS ALLUDING TO THOSE WHO WROTE THE LETTER YOU RECEIVED ONE DID YOU NOT YES FROM WHOM
MA FOI MONSIEUR YOU HAVE TOUCHED UPON A TENDER CHORD DO YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAYS MAJOR CERTAINLY I DO BUT DO YOU UNDERSTAND I DO YOUR SON SAYS HE REQUIRES MONEY WELL WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO SAID THE MAJOR
AT THE SAME TIME ADVANCING TOWARDS ANDREA AND SLIPPING A PACKET OF BANK NOTES INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S HAND WHAT IS THIS IT IS FROM YOUR FATHER FROM MY FATHER YES DID YOU NOT TELL HIM JUST NOW THAT YOU WANTED MONEY WELL THEN
BY THE TIME I HAD BURROWED AS FAR AS I THOUGHT NECESSARY I WAS TIRED AND LAY DOWN AT FULL LENGTH IN MY HOLE DELIGHTING IN SUCH A SENSE OF SAFETY AS I HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED
PAYABLE IN FLORENCE AT SIGNOR GOZZI'S ALSO A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO ON WHOM I GIVE YOU A DRAFT OF FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
BUT SAID ANDREA IF MY FATHER HAD MET ME I DOUBT IF HE WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED ME I MUST BE SOMEWHAT ALTERED SINCE HE LAST SAW ME OH THE VOICE OF NATURE SAID MONTE CRISTO TRUE INTERRUPTED THE YOUNG MAN I HAD NOT LOOKED UPON IT IN THAT LIGHT
CONSEQUENTLY HE MAY INDULGE HIS ECCENTRICITIES WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF THEIR RUINING HIM AND I HAVE PROMISED TO ADHERE TO HIS INSTRUCTIONS NOW SIR PRAY DO NOT BE OFFENDED AT THE QUESTION I AM ABOUT TO PUT TO YOU AS IT COMES IN THE WAY OF MY DUTY AS YOUR PATRON
EXCLAIMED ANDREA EVIDENTLY CHARMED WITH THE IDEA OF HIS SPEEDY DEPARTURE THEREFORE SAID MONTE CRISTO FEIGNING TO MISTAKE HIS MEANING THEREFORE I WILL NOT FOR ANOTHER INSTANT RETARD THE PLEASURE OF YOUR MEETING ARE YOU PREPARED TO EMBRACE YOUR WORTHY FATHER
AND FROM PONT DE BEAUVOISIN TO PARIS INDEED THEN YOUR FATHER OUGHT TO HAVE MET WITH YOU ON THE ROAD FOR IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME ROUTE WHICH HE HIMSELF TOOK AND THAT IS HOW WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRACE YOUR JOURNEY TO THIS PLACE
CERTAINLY I AM COME EXPRESSLY ON THAT ACCOUNT IT HAS COST ME MUCH TROUBLE TO FIND YOU BUT I HAD RESOLVED ON GIVING THEM INTO YOUR HANDS AND IF I HAD TO RECOMMENCE MY SEARCH IT WOULD OCCUPY ALL THE FEW REMAINING YEARS OF MY LIFE WHERE ARE THESE PAPERS THEN
AND WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH PLAINLY DENOTED AN UNUSUAL INTEREST IN THE CONTENTS WHEN HE HAD PERUSED THE DOCUMENTS AN INDEFINABLE EXPRESSION OF PLEASURE LIGHTED UP HIS COUNTENANCE AND LOOKING AT THE MAJOR WITH A MOST PECULIAR SMILE HE SAID IN VERY EXCELLENT TUSCAN
SHE GOT ME SOME MILK HALF CREAM I DO BELIEVE IT WAS SO NICE AND SOME OATCAKE AND WENT ON WITH HER WORK WHILE I ATE I REFLECTED THAT ANY MOMENT MISSUS MITCHELL MIGHT APPEAR TO DRAG ME BACK IN DISGRACE TO THAT HORRIBLE DEN
HE WAS CERTAINLY THE TALL YOUNG MAN WITH LIGHT HAIR RED BEARD BLACK EYES AND BRILLIANT COMPLEXION WHOM HIS MASTER HAD SO PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED TO HIM WHEN THE COUNT ENTERED THE ROOM THE YOUNG MAN WAS CARELESSLY STRETCHED ON A SOFA TAPPING HIS BOOT WITH THE GOLD HEADED CANE WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND
ASKED ANDREA WITH SOME UNEASINESS YES YOU WILL RECEIVE IT FROM YOUR FATHER PERSONALLY BUT LORD WILMORE WILL BE THE SECURITY FOR THE MONEY HE HAS AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR FATHER OPENED AN ACCOUNT OF SIX THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH
I WOULD WISH TO KNOW IF THEY HAVE NOT IN SOME MEASURE CONTRIBUTED TO RENDER YOU A STRANGER TO THE WORLD IN WHICH YOUR FORTUNE AND YOUR NAME ENTITLE YOU TO MAKE A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE SIR RETURNED THE YOUNG MAN WITH A REASSURANCE OF MANNER
I'LL COME BACK FOR HIM AT ONE O'CLOCK AND IF I DON'T COME JUST KEEP HIM TILL I DO COME THE DAME ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE DOOR AND THEN I DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS LAME AND HOBBLED VERY MUCH A RESOLUTION AROSE FULL FORMED IN MY BRAIN
ASKED CAVALCANTI AH SAID ANDREA WHEN MAY WE HOPE FOR THAT PLEASURE ON SATURDAY IF YOU WILL YES LET ME SEE SATURDAY
IT WAS THE SAME BOY WHO HAD BEEN TIED UNDER THE TABLE BUT HE HAD BEEN RELEASED FOR HIS LESSON THE DAME HOBBLED TO HIM AND FOUND HE HAD HIS BOOK UPSIDE DOWN WHEREUPON SHE TURNED IN WRATH TO THE TABLE AND TOOK FROM THE DRAWER A LONG LEATHER STRAP
SIGNED ABBE BUSONI IT IS THE SAME
WILL YOU NOT EMBRACE ME SIR SAID ANDREA IF YOU WISH IT MY SON SAID THE MAJOR AND THE TWO MEN EMBRACED EACH OTHER AFTER THE FASHION OF ACTORS ON THE STAGE THAT IS TO SAY EACH RESTED HIS HEAD ON THE OTHER'S SHOULDER
AND IF THEY HAVE CONDUCTED THEMSELVES TOWARDS YOU WITH ALL THE DEFERENCE DUE TO YOUR RANK FINALLY HE IS ANXIOUS TO SEE IF YOU HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ESCAPE THE BAD MORAL INFLUENCE TO WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND WHICH IS INFINITELY MORE TO BE DREADED THAN ANY PHYSICAL SUFFERING
BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULD NOT DIVULGE A WORD OF THESE ADVENTURES YOUR HISTORY IS QUITE A ROMANCE AND THE WORLD WHICH DELIGHTS IN ROMANCES IN YELLOW COVERS STRANGELY MISTRUSTS THOSE WHICH ARE BOUND IN LIVING PARCHMENT EVEN THOUGH THEY BE GILDED LIKE YOURSELF
I HOPE YOU DO NOT DOUBT IT GO THEN INTO THE DRAWING ROOM MY YOUNG FRIEND WHERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR FATHER AWAITING YOU ANDREA MADE A LOW BOW TO THE COUNT AND ENTERED THE ADJOINING ROOM MONTE CRISTO WATCHED HIM TILL HE DISAPPEARED
AND FOR A MAN OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE THIS PLAN IS AS EASY AS IT IS NECESSARY YOU MUST FORM HONORABLE FRIENDSHIPS AND BY THAT MEANS COUNTERACT THE PREJUDICE WHICH MAY ATTACH TO THE OBSCURITY OF YOUR FORMER LIFE ANDREA VISIBLY CHANGED COUNTENANCE
YES REPLIED ANDREA WITH AN EMBARRASSED AIR I WAS IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE A CARRIAGE WAS TO AWAIT YOU AT NICE PRECISELY SO AND IT CONVEYED ME FROM NICE TO GENOA FROM GENOA TO TURIN
WHY AS TO THAT I THINK MY DEAR SON YOU MUST BE BY THIS TIME SO ACCUSTOMED TO FRANCE AS TO LOOK UPON IT ALMOST AS A SECOND COUNTRY THE FACT IS SAID THE YOUNG MAN THAT I SHOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY GRIEVED TO LEAVE IT
MAKE YOUR MIND EASY ON THIS SCORE THOSE WHO TOOK ME FROM MY FATHER AND WHO ALWAYS INTENDED SOONER OR LATER TO SELL ME AGAIN TO MY ORIGINAL PROPRIETOR AS THEY HAVE NOW DONE CALCULATED THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR BARGAIN IT WOULD BE POLITIC TO LEAVE ME IN POSSESSION OF ALL MY PERSONAL
EVERYTHING DEPENDED ON WHETHER I COULD OPEN THE DOOR BEFORE SHE COULD REACH ME ONCE OUT OF THE HOUSE I WAS SURE OF RUNNING FASTER THAN SHE COULD FOLLOW AND SOON I HAD MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF HOW THOSE ARE HELPED WHO WILL HELP THEMSELVES
BUT A DREARY LITTLE HOUSE WITH NOTHING GREEN TO COVER THE BROWN STONES OF WHICH IT WAS BUILT AND HAVING AN OPEN DITCH IN FRONT OF IT WITH A STONE SLAB OVER IT FOR A BRIDGE DID I SAY THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE WALLS THIS MORNING THERE WAS THE LOVELIEST SUNSHINE
CERTAINLY I WILL DO SO SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH A QUICKNESS WHICH GAVE PROOF OF HIS READY INVENTION I AM AS YOU HAVE SAID THE COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI SON OF MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI
IN SHORT YOU WILL FIND YOUR FATHER A VERY PRESENTABLE PERSON I ASSURE YOU AH SIR YOU HAVE GIVEN ME CONFIDENCE IT IS SO LONG SINCE WE WERE SEPARATED THAT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST REMEMBRANCE OF HIM AND BESIDES YOU KNOW THAT IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD A LARGE FORTUNE COVERS ALL DEFECTS
ONE GLORIOUS MORNING IN EARLY SUMMER I FOUND MYSELF LED BY THE UNGENTLE HAND OF MISSUS MITCHELL TOWARDS A LITTLE SCHOOL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE VILLAGE KEPT BY AN OLD WOMAN CALLED MISSUS SHAND IN AN ENGLISH VILLAGE I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED DAME SHAND
IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT FETCH A HIGHER PRICE IN THE ROMAN MARKET MONTE CRISTO SMILED WITH SATISFACTION
I AM AT YOUR SERVICE SIR REPLIED THE MAJOR NOW SIR SAID MONTE CRISTO ADDRESSING ANDREA MAKE YOUR CONFESSION TO WHOM
AND YOU HAVE DONE WELL TO CONFORM IN EVERYTHING TO THE WISHES OF MY FRIEND SINBAD FOR YOUR FATHER IS INDEED HERE AND IS SEEKING YOU THE COUNT FROM THE MOMENT OF FIRST ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM HAD NOT ONCE LOST SIGHT OF THE EXPRESSION OF THE YOUNG MAN'S COUNTENANCE
AH THAT IS JUST WHAT I CANNOT TELL YOU IF I DID I SHOULD MAKE YOU AS WISE AS MYSELF WHICH IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO DO AND WHAT DID THE LETTER CONTAIN READ IT YOU ARE POOR AND YOUR FUTURE PROSPECTS ARE DARK AND GLOOMY DO YOU WISH FOR A NAME
YOU HAVE THEN BEEN INDUCED TO ALTER YOUR OPINION YOU HAVE HAD SOME PROOFS OF THEIR TRUTH THE MAJOR DREW FROM HIS POCKET A HANDFUL OF GOLD MOST PALPABLE PROOFS SAID HE AS YOU MAY PERCEIVE
WHY IT DOES NOT MUCH CONCERN US DO YOU THINK IT DOES NO I AGREE WITH YOU THERE WE MUST PLAY THE GAME TO THE END AND CONSENT TO BE BLINDFOLDED AH YOU SHALL SEE I PROMISE YOU I WILL SUSTAIN MY PART TO ADMIRATION
TAKEN AWAY BY THE TREACHERY OF MY TUTOR SO THAT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE NOT SEEN THE AUTHOR OF MY EXISTENCE SINCE I HAVE ARRIVED AT YEARS OF DISCRETION AND BECOME MY OWN MASTER I HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY SEEKING HIM BUT ALL IN VAIN
I NEVER ONCE DOUBTED YOUR DOING SO MONTE CRISTO CHOSE THIS MOMENT FOR RE ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM ON HEARING THE SOUND OF HIS FOOTSTEPS THE TWO MEN THREW THEMSELVES IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS AND WHILE THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF THIS EMBRACE THE COUNT ENTERED
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THE DESPAIR OF A MAN GOING TO THE GALLOWS AND BIDDING FAREWELL TO THE WORLD WE HAD TO CROSS A LITTLE STREAM AND WHEN WE REACHED THE MIDDLE OF THE FOOT BRIDGE I TUGGED YET AGAIN AT MY IMPRISONED HAND WITH A HALF FORMED INTENTION OF THROWING MYSELF INTO THE BROOK
THIS IS THE KIND OF DIFFICULTY WHICH I WISHED TO REPRESENT TO YOU MY DEAR COUNT YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE RECITED YOUR TOUCHING HISTORY BEFORE IT WOULD GO FORTH TO THE WORLD AND BE DEEMED UNLIKELY AND UNNATURAL
NOW REPLIED MONTE CRISTO THERE IS ONLY ONE SOURCE OF UNEASINESS LEFT IN YOUR FATHER'S MIND WHICH IS THIS HE IS ANXIOUS TO KNOW HOW YOU HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED DURING YOUR LONG ABSENCE FROM HIM HOW YOU HAVE BEEN TREATED BY YOUR PERSECUTORS
THEN THERE IS NO LONGER ANY SUCH THING IN ITALY AS BEING CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS THE MAJOR DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT
YOU THINK THEN THAT I MAY RELY ON THE COUNT'S PROMISES CERTAINLY I DO YOU ARE SURE HE WILL KEEP HIS WORD WITH ME TO THE LETTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME REMEMBER WE MUST CONTINUE TO PLAY OUR RESPECTIVE PARTS I AS A TENDER FATHER
HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR SON SAID THE MAJOR GRAVELY AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF PAINFUL SEPARATION SAID ANDREA IN THE SAME TONE OF VOICE AND GLANCING TOWARDS THE DOOR WHAT A HAPPINESS IT IS TO MEET AGAIN
HE DOES NOT WISH YOU TO KNOW THAT IT COMES FROM HIM I FULLY APPRECIATE HIS DELICACY SAID ANDREA CRAMMING THE NOTES HASTILY INTO HIS POCKET AND NOW GENTLEMEN I WISH YOU GOOD MORNING SAID MONTE CRISTO
I MEAN THAT IF THERE WERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW UP WITH IMPUNITY TWO SUCH DEEDS AS THESE IN FRANCE MY DEAR SIR HALF SUCH A PIECE OF EFFRONTERY AS THAT WOULD CAUSE YOU TO BE QUICKLY DESPATCHED TO TOULON FOR FIVE YEARS FOR CHANGE OF AIR
SHE HAD NOT EVEN INQUIRED WHETHER I COULD READ I TOOK THE CATECHISM AND STOOD AS BEFORE GO TO YOUR SEAT SHE SAID I OBEYED AND WITH THE BOOK BEFORE ME PONDERED MY PLAN
AND THAT I WAS GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND IT WAS VERY BITTER ESPECIALLY AS I HAD EXPECTED TO GO WITH MY ELDER BROTHER TO SPEND THE DAY AT A NEIGHBOURING FARM MISSUS MITCHELL OPENED THE DOOR AND LED ME IN IT WAS AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE DAME SHAND STOOD AT HER TABLE IRONING
HE IS THEN THE SAME ENGLISHMAN WHOM I MET
AND FINALLY MY FRIEND APPRISED ME OF YOUR COMING AND GAVE ME A FEW OTHER INSTRUCTIONS RELATIVE TO YOUR FUTURE FORTUNE I AM QUITE AWARE THAT MY FRIEND WILMORE IS PECULIAR BUT HE IS SINCERE AND AS RICH AS A GOLD MINE
AND THE SUBJECT OF UNPLEASANT REMARK I AGREE WITH YOU MONSIEUR SAID THE YOUNG MAN TURNING PALE AND IN SPITE OF HIMSELF TREMBLING BENEATH THE SCRUTINIZING LOOK OF HIS COMPANION SUCH CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT
YOU SHOULD FURNISH HIM WITH SOME OF COURSE REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
SAID THE MAJOR I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT I RECEIVED A LETTER ALMOST TO THE SAME EFFECT YOU YES FROM THE ABBE BUSONI NO FROM WHOM THEN
THE LESS PRETENSION THERE IS IN YOUR ATTIRE THE BETTER WILL BE THE EFFECT AS YOU ARE A RICH MAN IF YOU MEAN TO BUY ANY HORSES GET THEM OF DEVEDEUX AND IF YOU PURCHASE A PHAETON GO TO BAPTISTE FOR IT AT WHAT HOUR SHALL WE COME ASKED THE YOUNG MAN ABOUT HALF PAST SIX
FROM AN ENGLISHMAN CALLED LORD WILMORE WHO TAKES THE NAME OF SINBAD THE SAILOR AND OF WHOM YOU HAVE NO MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN I OF THE ABBE BUSONI YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE I AM AHEAD OF YOU YOU HAVE SEEN HIM THEN YES ONCE WHERE
SAID THE DAME IN A DUBIOUS TONE I HOPE HE'S A GOOD BOY FOR HE MUST BE GOOD IF HE COMES HERE WELL HE'S JUST MIDDLING HIS FATHER SPARES THE ROD MISSUS SHAND AND WE KNOW WHAT COMES OF THAT THEY WENT ON WITH THEIR TALK WHICH AS FAR AS I CAN RECALL IT
MOST UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED MONTE CRISTO YOUR FATHER MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI THE EXPRESSION OF TERROR WHICH FOR THE MOMENT HAD OVERSPREAD THE FEATURES OF THE YOUNG MAN HAD NOW DISAPPEARED AH YES THAT IS THE NAME CERTAINLY
FROM A CERTAIN ABBE BUSONI HAVE YOU ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HIM NO I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM WHAT DID HE SAY IN THE LETTER YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO BETRAY ME REST ASSURED OF THAT YOU WELL KNOW THAT OUR INTERESTS ARE THE SAME
THE NEXT MOMENT A WHOLESOME RAGE SENT THE BLOOD TO MY BRAIN FROM ABJECT COWARDICE TO WILD ATTACK I CANNOT CALL IT COURAGE WAS THE CHANGE OF AN INSTANT I RUSHED TOWARDS THE LITTLE WRETCH I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO FIGHT HIM
THEN READ FOR YOURSELF AND THE MAJOR GAVE A LETTER INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S HAND ANDREA READ IN A LOW VOICE
AND THEN THEY MADE THE BEST OF THEIR WAY HOME AGAIN BUT NEPTUNE DID NOT FORGET THE THREATS WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY THREATENED ULYSSES SO HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH JOVE FATHER JOVE SAID HE
AS SOON AS YOU TOUCH LAND TAKE IT OFF THROW IT BACK AS FAR AS YOU CAN INTO THE SEA AND THEN GO AWAY AGAIN WITH THESE WORDS
BUT ULYSSES WAS NOT WITHIN HE WAS ON THE SEA SHORE AS USUAL LOOKING OUT UPON THE BARREN OCEAN WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES GROANING AND BREAKING HIS HEART FOR SORROW CALYPSO GAVE MERCURY A SEAT AND SAID
I MAY ESCAPE THE COLD AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST BUT SOME SAVAGE BEAST MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME AND DEVOUR ME
THIS IS ONLY SOME ONE OR OTHER OF THE GODS WHO IS LURING ME TO RUIN BY ADVISING ME TO QUIT MY RAFT AT ANY RATE I WILL NOT DO SO AT PRESENT FOR THE LAND WHERE SHE SAID I SHOULD BE QUIT OF ALL TROUBLES
NEVERTHELESS I WILL READILY GIVE HIM SUCH ADVICE IN ALL GOOD FAITH AS WILL BE LIKELY TO BRING HIM SAFELY TO HIS OWN COUNTRY THEN SEND HIM AWAY SAID MERCURY OR JOVE WILL BE ANGRY WITH YOU AND PUNISH YOU ON THIS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
WHY IS NEPTUNE SO FURIOUSLY ANGRY WITH YOU HE IS GIVING YOU A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE BUT FOR ALL HIS BLUSTER HE WILL NOT KILL YOU YOU SEEM TO BE A SENSIBLE PERSON DO THEN AS I BID YOU STRIP
WHEN THEY HAD SATISFIED THEMSELVES WITH MEAT AND DRINK CALYPSO SPOKE SAYING
AND HERE HE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR THERE WERE NO ROCKS AND IT AFFORDED SHELTER FROM THE WIND HE FELT THAT THERE WAS A CURRENT SO HE PRAYED INWARDLY AND SAID HEAR ME O KING WHOEVER YOU MAY BE
OF HIS FATHER WHAT MY DEAR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT REPLIED HER FATHER DID YOU NOT SEND HIM THERE YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP ULYSSES TO GET HOME AND PUNISH THE SUITORS
YOUR PEOPLE AND WITH KING ALCINOUS AS HE SPOKE HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AND ALCINOUS SENT A MAN TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS SHIP AND TO THE SEA SHORE
IT HAS TWO ENTRANCES ONE FACING NORTH BY WHICH MORTALS CAN GO DOWN INTO THE CAVE WHILE THE OTHER COMES FROM THE SOUTH AND IS MORE MYSTERIOUS MORTALS CANNOT POSSIBLY GET IN BY IT IT IS THE WAY TAKEN BY THE GODS INTO THIS HARBOUR
SEEING IN WHAT GREAT DISTRESS ULYSSES NOW WAS SHE HAD COMPASSION UPON HIM AND RISING LIKE A SEA GULL FROM THE WAVES TOOK HER SEAT UPON THE RAFT MY POOR GOOD MAN SAID SHE
THEN HE TOO WENT ON BOARD AND LAY DOWN WITHOUT A WORD BUT THE CREW TOOK EVERY MAN HIS PLACE AND LOOSED THE HAWSER FROM THE PIERCED STONE TO WHICH IT HAD BEEN BOUND THEREON WHEN THEY BEGAN ROWING OUT TO SEA ULYSSES FELL INTO A DEEP
AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOU WHEN SHE HAD THUS SPOKEN SHE LED THE WAY RAPIDLY BEFORE HIM AND ULYSSES FOLLOWED IN HER STEPS SO THE PAIR GODDESS AND MAN WENT ON AND ON TILL THEY CAME TO CALYPSO'S CAVE
HE DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF HIS RAFT BUT SWAM AS FAST AS HE COULD TOWARDS IT GOT HOLD OF IT AND CLIMBED ON BOARD AGAIN SO AS TO ESCAPE DROWNING THE SEA TOOK THE RAFT AND TOSSED IT ABOUT AS AUTUMN WINDS WHIRL THISTLEDOWN ROUND AND ROUND UPON A ROAD
I AM AFRAID CALYPSO WAS RIGHT WHEN SHE SAID I SHOULD HAVE TROUBLE BY SEA BEFORE I GOT BACK HOME IT IS ALL COMING TRUE HOW BLACK IS JOVE MAKING HEAVEN WITH HIS CLOUDS AND WHAT A SEA THE WINDS ARE RAISING FROM EVERY QUARTER AT ONCE
MOREOVER THERE ARE GREAT LOOMS OF STONE ON WHICH THE NYMPHS WEAVE THEIR ROBES OF SEA PURPLE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE AND AT ALL TIMES THERE IS WATER WITHIN IT
THEREON MINERVA BEGAN TO TELL THEM OF THE MANY SUFFERINGS OF ULYSSES FOR SHE PITIED HIM AWAY THERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE NYMPH CALYPSO FATHER JOVE SAID SHE
WHO ARE NEAR OF KIN TO THE GODS AND WILL HONOUR HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE ONE OF OURSELVES THEY WILL SEND HIM IN A SHIP TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AND WILL GIVE HIM MORE BRONZE AND GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
BOUND INO'S VEIL UNDER HIS ARMS AND PLUNGED INTO THE SEA MEANING TO SWIM ON SHORE KING NEPTUNE WATCHED HIM AS HE DID SO AND WAGGED HIS HEAD MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND SAYING THERE NOW SWIM UP AND DOWN AS YOU BEST CAN
I SHALL NO LONGER BE HELD IN ANY SORT OF RESPECT AMONG YOU GODS IF MORTALS LIKE THE PHAEACIANS WHO ARE MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD SHOW SUCH SMALL REGARD FOR ME
HE CUT DOWN TWENTY TREES IN ALL AND ADZED THEM SMOOTH SQUARING THEM BY RULE IN GOOD WORKMANLIKE FASHION MEANWHILE CALYPSO CAME BACK WITH SOME AUGERS SO HE BORED HOLES WITH THEM AND FITTED THE TIMBERS TOGETHER WITH BOLTS AND RIVETS
AND WILL SEND YOU A FAIR WIND TO TAKE YOU HOME IF THE GODS IN HEAVEN SO WILL IT FOR THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS AND CAN SETTLE THEM BETTER THAN I CAN ULYSSES SHUDDERED AS HE HEARD HER NOW GODDESS HE ANSWERED
DID AS HE WAS TOLD FORTHWITH HE BOUND ON HIS GLITTERING GOLDEN SANDALS WITH WHICH HE COULD FLY LIKE THE WIND OVER LAND AND SEA HE TOOK THE WAND WITH WHICH HE SEALS MEN'S EYES IN SLEEP
LET US NOW THEREFORE PRESENT HIM FURTHER EACH ONE OF US WITH A LARGE TRIPOD AND A CAULDRON WE WILL RECOUP OURSELVES BY THE LEVY OF A GENERAL RATE
CALYPSO SMILED AT THIS AND CARESSED HIM WITH HER HAND YOU KNOW A GREAT DEAL SAID SHE BUT YOU ARE QUITE WRONG HERE MAY HEAVEN ABOVE AND EARTH BELOW BE MY WITNESSES WITH THE WATERS OF THE RIVER STYX
SO THAT ALL HIS BRAVE COMPANIONS PERISHED AND HE ALONE WAS CARRIED HITHER BY WIND AND TIDE JOVE SAYS THAT YOU ARE TO LET THIS MAN GO AT ONCE FOR IT IS DECREED THAT HE SHALL NOT PERISH HERE FAR FROM HIS OWN PEOPLE
I DO NOT SEE HOW I CAN DO ANY BETTER THAN THIS WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS NEPTUNE SENT A TERRIBLE GREAT WAVE THAT SEEMED TO REAR ITSELF ABOVE HIS HEAD TILL IT BROKE RIGHT OVER THE RAFT
LOW LYING ROCKS AND MOUNTAIN TOPS ULYSSES HEART NOW BEGAN TO FAIL HIM AND HE SAID DESPAIRINGLY TO HIMSELF ALAS JOVE HAS LET ME SEE LAND AFTER SWIMMING SO FAR THAT I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE
AND ONE COULD SMELL FROM FAR THE FRAGRANT REEK OF BURNING CEDAR AND SANDAL WOOD AS FOR HERSELF SHE WAS BUSY AT HER LOOM SHOOTING HER GOLDEN SHUTTLE THROUGH THE WARP AND SINGING BEAUTIFULLY ROUND HER CAVE THERE WAS A THICK WOOD OF ALDER
UPON HIS OWN SOIL HE HAD BEEN SO LONG AWAY THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IT AGAIN MOREOVER
CALYPSO SET MEAT AND DRINK BEFORE HIM OF THE FOOD THAT MORTALS EAT BUT HER MAIDS BROUGHT AMBROSIA AND NECTAR FOR HERSELF AND THEY LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE BEFORE THEM
WHICH THEN WENT TO PIECES AS THOUGH IT WERE A HEAP OF DRY CHAFF TOSSED ABOUT BY A WHIRLWIND ULYSSES GOT ASTRIDE OF ONE PLANK AND RODE UPON IT AS IF HE WERE ON HORSEBACK HE THEN TOOK OFF THE CLOTHES CALYPSO HAD GIVEN HIM
AND ALL YOU OTHER GODS THAT LIVE IN EVERLASTING BLISS I HOPE THERE MAY NEVER BE SUCH A THING AS A KIND AND WELL DISPOSED RULER ANY MORE NOR ONE WHO WILL GOVERN EQUITABLY I HOPE
WHO COULD POSSIBLY WANT TO COME ALL THIS WAY OVER THE SEA WHERE THERE ARE NO CITIES FULL OF PEOPLE TO OFFER ME SACRIFICES OR CHOICE HECATOMBS
THIS WILL STOP THEM FROM ESCORTING PEOPLE IN FUTURE AND I SHOULD ALSO LIKE TO BURY THEIR CITY UNDER A HUGE MOUNTAIN MY GOOD FRIEND ANSWERED JOVE I SHOULD RECOMMEND YOU AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE PEOPLE FROM THE CITY ARE WATCHING THE SHIP ON HER WAY
WICKED PEOPLE ARE NOW TRYING TO MURDER HIS ONLY SON TELEMACHUS WHO IS COMING HOME FROM PYLOS AND LACEDAEMON
AS IT WAS RETURNING FROM AN ESCORT AND BURY OUR CITY UNDER A HIGH MOUNTAIN
STILL I CANNOT CROSS JOVE NOR BRING HIS COUNSELS TO NOTHING THEREFORE IF HE INSISTS UPON IT LET THE MAN GO BEYOND THE SEAS AGAIN BUT I CANNOT SEND HIM ANYWHERE MYSELF FOR I HAVE NEITHER SHIPS NOR MEN WHO CAN TAKE HIM
FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF SUCH A HANDSOME PRESENT EVERY ONE APPROVED OF THIS AND THEN THEY WENT HOME TO BED EACH IN HIS OWN ABODE WHEN THE CHILD OF MORNING ROSY FINGERED DAWN APPEARED
ON LATE SETTING BOOTES AND ON THE BEAR WHICH MEN ALSO CALL THE WAIN AND WHICH TURNS ROUND AND ROUND WHERE IT IS FACING ORION AND ALONE NEVER DIPPING INTO THE STREAM OF OCEANUS FOR CALYPSO HAD TOLD HIM TO KEEP THIS TO HIS LEFT
AGAINST THE ROCKS THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SMASHED AND TORN TO PIECES IF MINERVA HAD NOT SHOWN HIM WHAT TO DO HE CAUGHT HOLD OF THE ROCK WITH BOTH HANDS AND CLUNG TO IT GROANING WITH PAIN TILL THE WAVE RETIRED SO HE WAS SAVED THAT TIME
HIS ORDERS HE SAYS THAT YOU HAVE HERE THE MOST ILL STARRED OF ALL THOSE WHO FOUGHT NINE YEARS BEFORE THE CITY OF KING PRIAM AND SAILED HOME IN THE TENTH YEAR AFTER HAVING SACKED IT
HE HAD COMPLETED THE WHOLE WORK AND ON THE FIFTH CALYPSO SENT HIM FROM THE ISLAND AFTER WASHING HIM AND GIVING HIM SOME CLEAN CLOTHES SHE GAVE HIM A GOAT SKIN FULL OF BLACK WINE AND ANOTHER LARGER ONE OF WATER
SAYING BLESS MY HEART WHO IS IT THAT CAN HAVE ROOTED THE SHIP IN THE SEA JUST AS SHE WAS GETTING INTO PORT WE COULD SEE THE WHOLE OF HER
BUT THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND ALCINOUS SAID I REMEMBER NOW THE OLD PROPHECY OF MY FATHER HE SAID THAT NEPTUNE WOULD BE ANGRY WITH US FOR TAKING EVERY ONE SO SAFELY OVER THE SEA AND WOULD ONE DAY WRECK A PHAEACIAN SHIP
THERE HE CREPT BENEATH TWO SHOOTS OF OLIVE THAT GREW FROM A SINGLE STOCK THE ONE AN UNGRAFTED SUCKER WHILE THE OTHER HAD BEEN GRAFTED NO WIND HOWEVER SQUALLY
WHO WILL NOT LET HIM GO AND HE CANNOT GET BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY FOR HE CAN FIND NEITHER SHIPS NOR SAILORS TO TAKE HIM OVER THE SEA FURTHERMORE
WHEREON INO RECEIVED IT INTO HER HANDS FROM THE WAVE THAT BORE IT TOWARDS HER THEN HE LEFT THE RIVER LAID HIMSELF DOWN AMONG THE RUSHES AND KISSED
OR WAKES THEM JUST AS HE PLEASES
THUS DID HE SPEAK AND THEY ALL HELD THEIR PEACE THROUGHOUT THE COVERED CLOISTER ENTHRALLED BY THE CHARM OF HIS STORY TILL PRESENTLY ALCINOUS BEGAN TO SPEAK ULYSSES SAID HE
WHEN HE HAD THUS SPOKEN HE SAID TO HIS SON MERCURY MERCURY YOU ARE OUR MESSENGER GO THEREFORE AND TELL CALYPSO WE HAVE DECREED THAT POOR ULYSSES IS TO RETURN HOME
THAT IT BROKE THE MAST HALF WAY UP AND BOTH SAIL AND YARD WENT OVER INTO THE SEA FOR A LONG TIME ULYSSES WAS UNDER WATER
BUT SHALL RETURN TO HIS HOUSE AND COUNTRY AND SEE HIS FRIENDS AGAIN CALYPSO TREMBLED WITH RAGE WHEN SHE HEARD THIS YOU GODS SHE EXCLAIMED OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES
THEREON HE FLOATED ABOUT FOR TWO NIGHTS AND TWO DAYS IN THE WATER WITH A HEAVY SWELL ON THE SEA AND DEATH STARING HIM IN THE FACE BUT WHEN THE THIRD DAY BROKE THE WIND FELL AND THERE WAS A DEAD CALM WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A BREATH OF AIR STIRRING
HAVE MERCY UPON ME O KING FOR I DECLARE MYSELF YOUR SUPPLIANT THEN THE GOD STAID HIS STREAM AND STILLED THE WAVES MAKING ALL CALM BEFORE HIM AND BRINGING HIM SAFELY INTO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER HERE
I AM NOW SAFE TO PERISH BLEST AND THRICE BLEST WERE THOSE DANAANS WHO FELL BEFORE TROY IN THE CAUSE OF THE SONS OF ATREUS WOULD THAT I HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE DAY WHEN THE TROJANS WERE PRESSING ME SO SORELY ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF ACHILLES
AFTER WHICH THE INSPIRED BARD DEMODOCUS WHO WAS A FAVOURITE WITH EVERY ONE SANG TO THEM BUT ULYSSES KEPT ON TURNING HIS EYES TOWARDS THE SUN AS THOUGH TO HASTEN HIS SETTING FOR HE WAS LONGING TO BE ON HIS WAY
AND CALYPSO WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR ULYSSES FOR SHE HAD HEARD JOVE'S MESSAGE SHE FOUND HIM SITTING UPON THE BEACH WITH HIS EYES EVER FILLED WITH TEARS AND DYING OF SHEER HOME SICKNESS
AS HE ROSE ON THE SWELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY AHEAD AND COULD SEE LAND QUITE NEAR THEN AS CHILDREN REJOICE WHEN THEIR DEAR FATHER BEGINS TO GET BETTER AFTER HAVING FOR A LONG TIME BORNE SORE AFFLICTION SENT HIM BY SOME ANGRY SPIRIT
AND NOW YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME TOO BECAUSE I HAVE A MAN HERE I FOUND THE POOR CREATURE SITTING ALL ALONE ASTRIDE OF A KEEL FOR JOVE HAD STRUCK HIS SHIP WITH LIGHTNING AND SUNK IT IN MID OCEAN
TURNED IT INTO STONE AND DROVE IT DOWN WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HAND SO AS TO ROOT IT IN THE GROUND AFTER THIS HE WENT AWAY THE PHAEACIANS THEN BEGAN TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES AND ONE WOULD TURN TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBOUR
EVEN SO DID ULYSSES REJOICE WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN AND HE AT ONCE SAID TO THE PHAEACIANS ADDRESSING HIMSELF MORE PARTICULARLY TO KING ALCINOUS SIR AND ALL OF YOU FAREWELL
SO AGAIN WHEN CERES FELL IN LOVE WITH IASION AND YIELDED TO HIM IN A THRICE PLOUGHED FALLOW FIELD
AND THEN SAID WE ARE SPEAKING GOD AND GODDESS TO ONE ANOTHER AND YOU ASK ME WHY I HAVE COME HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU TRULY AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO JOVE SENT ME IT WAS NO DOING OF MINE
AND TURNED HITHER AND THITHER
SEEMED TO BE STILL A GOOD WAY OFF I KNOW WHAT I WILL DO I AM SURE IT WILL BE BEST NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I WILL STICK TO THE RAFT AS LONG AS HER TIMBERS HOLD TOGETHER BUT WHEN THE SEA BREAKS HER UP I WILL SWIM FOR IT
CALYPSO BROUGHT HIM SOME LINEN TO MAKE THE SAILS AND HE MADE THESE TOO EXCELLENTLY MAKING THEM FAST WITH BRACES AND SHEETS LAST OF ALL WITH THE HELP OF LEVERS HE DREW THE RAFT DOWN INTO THE WATER IN FOUR DAYS
WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY WERE AFRAID AND GOT READY THE BULLS
BREEDS MANY SUCH AND I KNOW THAT NEPTUNE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS A WAVE CAUGHT HIM AND TOOK HIM WITH SUCH FORCE
WINDS FROM EAST SOUTH NORTH AND WEST FELL UPON HIM ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND A TREMENDOUS SEA GOT UP SO THAT ULYSSES HEART BEGAN TO FAIL HIM ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY WHAT EVER WILL BECOME OF ME
THE OTHERS EACH FROM HIS OWN SEAT MADE A DRINK OFFERING TO THE BLESSED GODS THAT LIVE IN HEAVEN
WHEN HE WAS IN THIS PLIGHT INO DAUGHTER OF CADMUS ALSO CALLED LEUCOTHEA SAW HIM SHE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A MERE MORTAL BUT HAD BEEN SINCE RAISED TO THE RANK OF A MARINE GODDESS
YOU ARE ALWAYS JEALOUS AND HATE SEEING A GODDESS TAKE A FANCY TO A MORTAL MAN AND LIVE WITH HIM IN OPEN MATRIMONY SO WHEN ROSY FINGERED DAWN MADE LOVE TO ORION
THEN THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS TO GET DINNER AND HE SACRIFICED A BULL FOR THEM IN HONOUR OF JOVE WHO IS THE LORD OF ALL THEY SET THE STEAKS TO GRILL AND MADE AN EXCELLENT DINNER
AND AT THE SAME TIME HE KEPT LOOKING TOWARDS THE SHORE TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND SOME HAVEN OR A SPIT THAT SHOULD TAKE THE WAVES ASLANT BY AND BY AS HE SWAM ON HE CAME TO THE MOUTH OF A RIVER
INASMUCH AS HE HAD SPOKEN REASONABLY ALCINOUS THEREFORE SAID TO HIS SERVANT PONTONOUS MIX SOME WINE AND HAND IT ROUND TO EVERYBODY THAT WE MAY OFFER A PRAYER TO FATHER JOVE AND SPEED OUR GUEST UPON HIS WAY
NOW THAT YOU HAVE REACHED MY HOUSE I DOUBT NOT YOU WILL GET HOME WITHOUT FURTHER MISADVENTURE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU HAVE SUFFERED IN THE PAST TO YOU OTHERS HOWEVER WHO COME HERE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
SO MERCURY STOOD STILL AND LOOKED AT IT BUT WHEN HE HAD ADMIRED IT SUFFICIENTLY HE WENT INSIDE THE CAVE CALYPSO KNEW HIM AT ONCE FOR THE GODS ALL KNOW EACH OTHER NO MATTER HOW FAR THEY LIVE FROM ONE ANOTHER
A VINE LOADED WITH GRAPES WAS TRAINED AND GREW LUXURIANTLY ABOUT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE
WHY HAVE YOU COME TO SEE ME MERCURY HONOURED AND EVER WELCOME FOR YOU DO NOT VISIT ME OFTEN SAY WHAT YOU WANT I WILL DO IT FOR YOU AT ONCE IF I CAN AND IF IT CAN BE DONE AT ALL BUT COME INSIDE
THE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS TO LIFT ULYSSES WITH HIS RUG AND LINEN SHEET OUT OF THE SHIP AND LAY HIM DOWN UPON THE SAND STILL FAST ASLEEP
FAREWELL QUEEN SAID HE HENCEFORWARD AND FOR EVER TILL AGE AND DEATH THE COMMON LOT OF MANKIND LAY THEIR HANDS UPON YOU I NOW TAKE MY LEAVE
THEREON HE GATHERED HIS CLOUDS TOGETHER GRASPED HIS TRIDENT STIRRED IT ROUND IN THE SEA AND ROUSED THE RAGE OF EVERY WIND THAT BLOWS TILL EARTH SEA AND SKY WERE HIDDEN IN CLOUD AND NIGHT SPRANG FORTH OUT OF THE HEAVENS
THE BOUNTEOUS EARTH ALAS HE CRIED TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY WHAT EVER WILL BECOME OF ME AND HOW IS IT ALL TO END IF I STAY HERE UPON THE RIVER BED THROUGH THE LONG WATCHES OF THE NIGHT
AND THE STONES COME UP ALONG WITH IT EVEN SO DID THE ROCKS TEAR THE SKIN FROM HIS STRONG HANDS AND THEN THE WAVE DREW HIM DEEP DOWN UNDER THE WATER HERE
HE MADE THE RAFT AS BROAD AS A SKILLED SHIPWRIGHT
IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MUST LEAVE OFF GIVING PEOPLE ESCORTS WHEN THEY COME HERE AND IN THE NEXT LET US SACRIFICE TWELVE PICKED BULLS TO NEPTUNE THAT HE MAY HAVE MERCY UPON US AND NOT BURY OUR CITY UNDER THE HIGH MOUNTAIN
IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SOUTH NORTH EAST AND WEST WINDS WERE ALL PLAYING BATTLEDORE AND SHUTTLECOCK WITH IT AT ONCE
DAYS SEVEN AND TEN DID HE SAIL OVER THE SEA AND ON THE EIGHTEENTH THE DIM OUTLINES OF THE MOUNTAINS ON THE NEAREST PART OF THE PHAEACIAN COAST APPEARED RISING LIKE A SHIELD ON THE HORIZON
THEY HURRIED DOWN TO THE SHIP AND BROUGHT THEIR CAULDRONS WITH THEM ALCINOUS WENT ON BOARD AND SAW EVERYTHING SO SECURELY STOWED UNDER THE SHIP'S BENCHES THAT NOTHING COULD BREAK ADRIFT AND INJURE THE ROWERS
SO THAT ALL HIS CREW WERE DROWNED WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS DRIVEN BY WIND AND WAVES ON TO MY ISLAND I GOT FOND OF HIM AND CHERISHED HIM AND HAD SET MY HEART ON MAKING HIM IMMORTAL SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GROW OLD ALL HIS DAYS
BUT AT LAST HE GOT HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER AND SPAT OUT THE BITTER BRINE THAT WAS RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE IN STREAMS IN SPITE OF ALL THIS HOWEVER
AND MAKING ME PRESENTS WHICH HEAVEN GRANT THAT I MAY TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT
THEN AS ONE WHO LIVES ALONE IN THE COUNTRY FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOR HIDES A BRAND AS FIRE SEED IN THE ASHES TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM HAVING TO GET A LIGHT ELSEWHERE
THE PRECIPICES AND THE GOODLY TREES APPEARED ALL CHANGED AS HE STARTED UP AND LOOKED UPON HIS NATIVE LAND SO HE SMOTE HIS THIGHS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HANDS AND CRIED ALOUD DESPAIRINGLY ALAS
BUT NOW THEY HAVE BROUGHT HIM IN A SHIP FAST ASLEEP AND HAVE LANDED HIM IN ITHACA AFTER LOADING HIM WITH MORE MAGNIFICENT PRESENTS OF BRONZE GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD EVER HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
TO DRINK MY CHOICEST WINE AND LISTEN TO MY BARD I WOULD INSIST AS FOLLOWS
WHICH LIES BETWEEN TWO POINTS THAT BREAK THE LINE OF THE SEA AND SHUT THE HARBOUR IN
AND NOW HE IS CLOSE TO THE LAND OF THE PHAEACIANS WHERE IT IS DECREED THAT HE SHALL ESCAPE FROM THE CALAMITIES THAT HAVE BEFALLEN HIM STILL HE SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF HARDSHIP YET BEFORE HE HAS DONE WITH IT
SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER BREATHE
THEN THEY TOOK OUT THE PRESENTS WHICH MINERVA HAD PERSUADED THE PHAEACIANS TO GIVE HIM WHEN HE WAS SETTING OUT ON HIS VOYAGE HOMEWARDS THEY PUT THESE ALL TOGETHER BY THE ROOT OF THE OLIVE TREE AWAY FROM THE ROAD
WHEN HE HAD SUFFERED SUFFICIENTLY I DID NOT SAY THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GET HOME AT ALL FOR I KNEW YOU HAD ALREADY NODDED YOUR HEAD ABOUT IT AND PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD DO SO
AS ONE WHO HAS BEEN ALL DAY PLOUGHING A FALLOW FIELD WITH A COUPLE OF OXEN KEEPS THINKING ABOUT HIS SUPPER AND IS GLAD WHEN NIGHT COMES THAT HE MAY GO AND GET IT FOR IT IS ALL HIS LEGS CAN DO TO CARRY HIM
MOREOVER SHE MADE THE WIND FAIR AND WARM FOR HIM AND GLADLY DID ULYSSES SPREAD HIS SAIL BEFORE IT WHILE HE SAT AND GUIDED THE RAFT SKILFULLY BY MEANS OF THE RUDDER
A HURRICANE MAY CARRY ME OUT TO SEA AGAIN SORELY AGAINST MY WILL OR HEAVEN MAY SEND SOME GREAT MONSTER OF THE DEEP TO ATTACK ME FOR AMPHITRITE
AND LET ME SET REFRESHMENT BEFORE YOU AS SHE SPOKE SHE DREW A TABLE LOADED WITH AMBROSIA BESIDE HIM AND MIXED HIM SOME RED NECTAR SO MERCURY ATE AND DRANK TILL HE HAD HAD ENOUGH
THAT I MEAN YOU NO SORT OF HARM AND AM ONLY ADVISING YOU TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD DO MYSELF IN YOUR PLACE I AM DEALING WITH YOU QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARDLY
FORGETFUL OF ALL THAT HE HAD SUFFERED BOTH ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND BY THE WAVES OF THE WEARY SEA WHEN THE BRIGHT STAR THAT HERALDS THE APPROACH OF DAWN BEGAN TO SHOW
I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO AT ONCE REPLIED NEPTUNE IF I WERE NOT ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANYTHING THAT MIGHT DISPLEASE YOU NOW THEREFORE I SHOULD LIKE TO WRECK THE PHAEACIAN SHIP AS IT IS RETURNING FROM ITS ESCORT
THEN SHE DIVED DOWN AGAIN LIKE A SEA GULL AND VANISHED BENEATH THE DARK BLUE WATERS BUT ULYSSES DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY
BUT THE GODS DELIVER HIM FROM EVIL SO WAS ULYSSES THANKFUL WHEN HE AGAIN SAW LAND AND TREES AND SWAM ON WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH THAT HE MIGHT ONCE MORE SET FOOT UPON DRY GROUND
I AM SO EXHAUSTED THAT THE BITTER COLD AND DAMP MAY MAKE AN END OF ME FOR TOWARDS SUNRISE THERE WILL BE A KEEN WIND BLOWING FROM OFF THE RIVER IF ON THE OTHER HAND I CLIMB THE HILL SIDE FIND SHELTER IN THE WOODS AND SLEEP IN SOME THICKET
POOR ULYSSES WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY PERISHED EVEN IN SPITE OF HIS OWN DESTINY IF MINERVA HAD NOT HELPED HIM TO KEEP HIS WITS ABOUT HIM HE SWAM SEAWARD AGAIN BEYOND REACH OF THE SURF THAT WAS BEATING AGAINST THE LAND
FOR THERE IS NOT ONE OF HIS SUBJECTS BUT HAS FORGOTTEN ULYSSES WHO RULED THEM AS THOUGH HE WERE THEIR FATHER THERE HE IS LYING IN GREAT PAIN IN AN ISLAND WHERE DWELLS THE NYMPH CALYPSO
ALL HIS PRIZE MONEY AND HAD GOT HOME WITHOUT DISASTER THIS IS HOW WE HAVE SETTLED THAT HE SHALL RETURN TO HIS COUNTRY AND HIS FRIENDS THUS HE SPOKE AND MERCURY GUIDE AND GUARDIAN SLAYER OF ARGUS
BESIDES YOU ARE PERFECTLY ABLE TO PROTECT TELEMACHUS AND TO SEE HIM SAFELY HOME AGAIN WHILE THE SUITORS HAVE TO COME HURRY SKURRYING BACK WITHOUT HAVING KILLED HIM
FOR THERE WAS A GREAT LITTER OF DEAD LEAVES LYING ABOUT ENOUGH TO MAKE A COVERING FOR TWO OR THREE MEN EVEN IN HARD WINTER WEATHER HE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO SEE THIS SO HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND HEAPED THE LEAVES ALL ROUND HIM
HE GOT TO THE ISLAND WHICH WAS HIS JOURNEY'S END HE LEFT THE SEA AND WENT ON BY LAND TILL HE CAME TO THE CAVE WHERE THE NYMPH CALYPSO LIVED HE FOUND HER AT HOME THERE WAS A LARGE FIRE BURNING ON THE HEARTH
BUT PRESENTLY THE WAVE CAME ON AGAIN AND CARRIED HIM BACK WITH IT FAR INTO THE SEA TEARING HIS HANDS AS THE SUCKERS OF A POLYPUS ARE TORN WHEN SOME ONE PLUCKS IT FROM ITS BED
AND SAVE ME FROM THE ANGER OF THE SEA GOD NEPTUNE FOR I APPROACH YOU PRAYERFULLY ANY ONE WHO HAS LOST HIS WAY HAS AT ALL TIMES A CLAIM EVEN UPON THE GODS
SAILS OF THE SEA I NEVER SAW SO LARGE NO FEATHERS HAD THEY BUT AS OF A BAT THEIR FASHION WAS AND HE WAS WAVING THEM
HE WEEPETH HERE THE SILVER OF THE FRENCH I SAW
THAT DAY WE ALL WERE SILENT AND THE NEXT AH OBDURATE EARTH WHEREFORE DIDST THOU NOT OPEN WHEN WE HAD COME UNTO THE FOURTH DAY
WHO FULL FIVE ELLS WITHOUT THE HEAD FORTH ISSUED FROM THE CAVERN O THOU WHO IN THE VALLEY FORTUNATE WHICH SCIPIO THE HEIR OF GLORY MADE WHEN HANNIBAL TURNED BACK WITH ALL HIS HOSTS
AND MADE ME STOP SAYING BEHOLD DIS AND BEHOLD THE PLACE WHERE THOU WITH FORTITUDE MUST ARM THYSELF HOW FROZEN I BECAME AND POWERLESS THEN ASK IT NOT READER
UNDERNEATH EACH CAME FORTH TWO MIGHTY WINGS
NOT DOWNWARD TURNED BUT ALL OF THEM REVERSED WEEPING ITSELF THERE DOES NOT LET THEM WEEP AND GRIEF THAT FINDS A BARRIER IN THE EYES TURNS ITSELF INWARD TO INCREASE THE ANGUISH
BUT YOU SEE MATTHEW DID MATTHEW UNDERSTANDS ME AND IT'S SO NICE TO BE UNDERSTOOD MARILLA ANNE WAS TOO EXCITED TO DO HERSELF JUSTICE AS TO LESSONS THAT MORNING IN SCHOOL
SOMEWHAT I HAD LOOKED I DOWNWARD TURNED ME AND SAW TWO SO CLOSE THE HAIR UPON THEIR HEADS TOGETHER MINGLED
IN HIS OWN BODY AND ONE NEAR OF KIN WHO MADE TOGETHER WITH HIM THE BETRAYAL
FOR FEAR OF HIM MADE OF THE SEA A VEIL AND CAME TO OUR HEMISPHERE AND PERADVENTURE TO FLEE FROM HIM
THE CREATURE WHO ONCE HAD THE BEAUTEOUS SEMBLANCE
ABOVE THE MIDDLE PART OF EITHER SHOULDER AND THEY WERE JOINED TOGETHER AT THE CREST AND THE RIGHT HAND ONE SEEMED TWIXT WHITE AND YELLOW THE LEFT WAS SUCH TO LOOK UPON AS THOSE WHO COME FROM WHERE THE NILE FALLS VALLEY WARD
HE PUT US DOWN NOR THUS BOWED DOWNWARD MADE HE THERE DELAY BUT AS A MAST DOES IN A SHIP UPROSE INFERNO
IS NOT BELOW HERE EVERY VAPOUR QUENCHED
SEEMS ALIVE INFERNO
AND EVEN AS BREAD THROUGH HUNGER IS DEVOURED THE UPPERMOST ON THE OTHER SET HIS TEETH THERE WHERE THE BRAIN IS TO THE NAPE UNITED NOT IN ANOTHER FASHION TYDEUS GNAWED THE TEMPLES OF MENALIPPUS IN DISDAIN
CONSIDER NOW HOW GREAT MUST BE THAT WHOLE
WHENCE I BETOOK ME ALREADY BLIND TO GROPING OVER EACH AND THREE DAYS CALLED THEM AFTER THEY WERE DEAD THEN HUNGER DID WHAT SORROW COULD NOT DO WHEN HE HAD
BUT A FLORENTINE THOU SEEMEST TO ME TRULY WHEN I HEAR THEE THOU HAST TO KNOW I WAS COUNT UGOLINO AND THIS ONE WAS RUGGIERI THE ARCHBISHOP NOW I WILL TELL THEE WHY I AM SUCH A NEIGHBOUR
OF A SMALL RIVULET THAT THERE DESCENDETH
IT WAS ELEVEN WHEN THEY GOT HOME SATED WITH DISSIPATION BUT WITH THE EXCEEDING SWEET PLEASURE OF TALKING IT ALL OVER STILL TO COME
OTHERS STAND ERECT THIS WITH THE HEAD AND THAT ONE WITH THE SOLES ANOTHER BOW LIKE FACE TO FEET INVERTS WHEN IN ADVANCE SO FAR WE HAD PROCEEDED
SHE AND DIANA TALKED SO CONSTANTLY ABOUT IT ALL DAY THAT WITH A STRICTER TEACHER THAN MISTER PHILLIPS DIRE DISGRACE
MUCH LESS PAIN TWILL GIVE US IF THOU DO EAT OF US THYSELF DIDST CLOTHE US WITH THIS POOR FLESH AND DO THOU STRIP IT OFF I CALMED ME THEN NOT TO MAKE THEM MORE SAD
E'EN THUS THE MARGIN WHICH SURROUNDS THE WELL WITH ONE HALF OF THEIR BODIES TURRETED THE HORRIBLE GIANTS WHOM JOVE MENACES E'EN NOW FROM OUT THE HEAVENS WHEN HE THUNDERS
ANNE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE BORNE IT IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN GOING TO THE CONCERT FOR NOTHING ELSE WAS DISCUSSED THAT DAY IN SCHOOL THE AVONLEA DEBATING CLUB WHICH MET FORTNIGHTLY ALL WINTER HAD HAD SEVERAL SMALLER FREE ENTERTAINMENTS
TELL ME I SAID WHO ARE YOU
ANNE DID REMEMBER IT AND WAS BACK IN THE STIPULATED TIME ALTHOUGH PROBABLY NO MORTAL WILL EVER KNOW JUST WHAT IT COST HER TO CONFINE THE DISCUSSION OF DIANA'S IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE LIMITS OF TEN MINUTES BUT AT LEAST SHE HAD MADE GOOD USE OF THEM
LOOKING AT PRISSY ANDREWS AT THE END OF EVERY SENTENCE ANNE FELT THAT SHE COULD RISE AND MUTINY ON THE SPOT IF BUT ONE ROMAN CITIZEN LED THE WAY ONLY ONE NUMBER ON THE PROGRAM FAILED TO INTEREST HER WHEN GILBERT BLYTHE RECITED
THAN THAT ONE DID THE SKULL AND THE OTHER THINGS
BINGEN ON THE RHINE ANNE PICKED UP RHODA MURRAY'S LIBRARY BOOK AND READ IT UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED
AND NOW BENEATH THE HEMISPHERE ART COME
THAT FROM THE FROST THE SEMBLANCE HAD OF GLASS AND NOT OF WATER SO THICK A VEIL NE'ER MADE UPON ITS CURRENT IN WINTER TIME DANUBE IN AUSTRIA NOR THERE BENEATH THE FRIGID SKY THE DON
ISN'T IT ALL LIKE A BEAUTIFUL DREAM DO I REALLY LOOK THE SAME AS USUAL
AND AS ANNE ASSURED DIANA EVERY SUCCEEDING THRILL WAS THRILLIER THAN THE LAST WHEN PRISSY ANDREWS ATTIRED IN A NEW PINK SILK WAIST WITH A STRING OF PEARLS ABOUT HER SMOOTH WHITE THROAT AND REAL CARNATIONS IN HER HAIR
DIANA HAS JUST SIGNALED FIVE FLASHES AND I'M REALLY SUFFERING TO KNOW WHAT IT IS WELL YOU NEEDN'T SUFFER ANY LONGER SAID MARILLA SARCASTICALLY YOU CAN GO BUT YOU'RE TO BE BACK HERE IN JUST TEN MINUTES REMEMBER THAT
AND IF I THEN BECAME DISQUIETED LET STOLID PEOPLE THINK WHO DO NOT SEE WHAT THE POINT IS BEYOND WHICH I HAD PASSED RISE UP THE MASTER SAID UPON THY FEET
TRUSTING IN HIM I WAS MADE PRISONER AND AFTER PUT TO DEATH I NEED NOT SAY BUT NE'ERTHELESS WHAT THOU CANST NOT HAVE HEARD THAT IS TO SAY HOW CRUEL WAS MY DEATH
LIFT FROM MINE EYES THE RIGID VEILS THAT I MAY VENT THE SORROW WHICH IMPREGNS MY HEART A LITTLE E'ER THE WEEPING RECONGEAL WHENCE I TO HIM IF THOU WOULDST HAVE ME HELP THEE
BUT IN WALKING MONG THE HEADS I STRUCK MY FOOT HARD IN THE FACE OF ONE WEEPING HE GROWLED WHY DOST THOU TRAMPLE ME UNLESS THOU COMEST TO INCREASE THE VENGEANCE OF MONTAPERTI
WAS AND WAIT CARLINO TO EXONERATE ME THEN I BEHELD A THOUSAND FACES MADE PURPLE WITH COLD
THE WAY IS LONG AND DIFFICULT THE ROAD AND NOW THE SUN TO MIDDLE TIERCE RETURNS IT WAS NOT ANY PALACE CORRIDOR THERE WHERE WE WERE BUT DUNGEON NATURAL
WITH CHAINS THAT HELD HIM SO BEGIRT ABOUT FROM THE NECK DOWN THAT ON THE PART UNCOVERED IT WOUND ITSELF AS FAR AS THE FIFTH GYRE THIS PROUD ONE WISHED TO MAKE EXPERIMENT OF HIS OWN POWER AGAINST THE SUPREME JOVE
WHERE EVERYTHING OF WEIGHT UNITES TOGETHER AND I WAS SHIVERING IN THE ETERNAL SHADE
AND NEATH WHOSE COPE WAS PUT TO DEATH THE MAN WHO WITHOUT SIN WAS BORN AND LIVED
THE GUIDE AND I INTO THAT HIDDEN ROAD NOW ENTERED TO RETURN TO THE BRIGHT WORLD AND WITHOUT CARE OF HAVING ANY REST WE MOUNTED UP HE FIRST AND I THE SECOND
OH MARILLA WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW TOMORROW IS DIANA'S BIRTHDAY WELL HER MOTHER TOLD HER SHE COULD ASK ME TO GO HOME WITH HER FROM SCHOOL AND STAY ALL NIGHT WITH HER
DON'T BLAME ME BLAME MATTHEW ANNE SHIRLEY YOU'RE DRIPPING GREASY WATER ALL OVER THE FLOOR I NEVER SAW SUCH A CARELESS CHILD
BOTH OF MY HANDS IN AGONY I BIT AND THINKING THAT I DID IT FROM DESIRE OF EATING ON A SUDDEN THEY UPROSE AND SAID THEY FATHER
FOR A MOMENT MARILLA LOOKED THINGS NOT LAWFUL TO BE UTTERED THEN SHE YIELDED TO THE INEVITABLE AND SAID TARTLY VERY WELL SHE CAN GO SINCE NOTHING ELSE'LL PLEASE YOU ANNE FLEW OUT OF THE PANTRY DRIPPING DISHCLOTH IN HAND
BUT I DON'T APPROVE OF THIS CONCERT PLAN
MAKE US NOT GO TO TITYUS NOR TYPHOEUS
I DON'T THEN RETORTED MARILLA WHO'S BRINGING THIS CHILD UP MATTHEW YOU OR ME WELL NOW YOU ADMITTED MATTHEW DON'T INTERFERE THEN WELL NOW I AIN'T INTERFERING
THE VALLEY WHENCE BISENZIO DESCENDS BELONGED TO THEM AND TO THEIR FATHER ALBERT THEY FROM ONE BODY CAME AND ALL CAINA THOU SHALT SEARCH THROUGH AND SHALT NOT FIND A SHADE MORE WORTHY TO BE FIXED IN GELATINE
SO LOUD IT WOULD HAVE MADE EACH THUNDER FAINT WHICH COUNTER TO IT FOLLOWING ITS WAY MINE EYES DIRECTED WHOLLY TO ONE PLACE AFTER THE DOLOROUS DISCOMFITURE
WHO HERE A DATE AM GETTING FOR MY FIG O SAID I TO HIM NOW ART THOU TOO DEAD AND HE TO ME HOW MAY MY BODY FARE UP IN THE WORLD NO KNOWLEDGE I POSSESS
AND ONE WHO HAD BY REASON OF THE COLD LOST BOTH HIS EARS STILL WITH HIS VISAGE DOWNWARD SAID WHY DOST THOU SO MIRROR THYSELF IN US IF THOU DESIRE TO KNOW WHO THESE TWO ARE
BUT IF MY WORDS BE SEED THAT MAY BEAR FRUIT OF INFAMY TO THE TRAITOR WHOM I GNAW SPEAKING AND WEEPING SHALT THOU SEE TOGETHER
NOT HE IN WHOM WERE BROKEN BREAST AND SHADOW AT ONE AND THE SAME BLOW BY ARTHUR'S HAND FOCACCIA NOT NOT HE WHO ME ENCUMBERS SO WITH HIS HEAD I SEE NO FARTHER FORWARD
WHO CAN SPEAK AND IS UNBOUND WHO AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL CRIME SHALL PLACE US
ONCE BROUGHT'ST A THOUSAND LIONS FOR THY PREY AND WHO HADST THOU BEEN AT THE MIGHTY WAR AMONG THY BROTHERS SOME IT SEEMS STILL THINK THE SONS OF EARTH THE VICTORY WOULD HAVE GAINED
TILL I BEHELD THROUGH A ROUND APERTURE SOME OF THE BEAUTEOUS THINGS THAT HEAVEN DOTH BEAR
AND IF OF ELEPHANTS AND WHALES SHE DOTH NOT REPENT HER
AT LAST THEY WERE READY CHEEKS SCARLET AND EYES GLOWING WITH EXCITEMENT TRUE ANNE COULD NOT HELP A LITTLE PANG WHEN SHE CONTRASTED HER PLAIN BLACK TAM AND SHAPELESS TIGHT SLEEVED HOMEMADE GRAY CLOTH COAT
WITH DIANA'S JAUNTY FUR CAP AND SMART LITTLE JACKET BUT SHE REMEMBERED IN TIME THAT SHE HAD AN IMAGINATION AND COULD USE IT THEN DIANA'S COUSINS THE MURRAYS FROM NEWBRIDGE CAME
MARILLA GAVE A GASP OF HELPLESSNESS AND TOOK REFUGE IN SILENCE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN ANNE WAS WASHING THE BREAKFAST DISHES IN THE PANTRY MATTHEW PAUSED ON HIS WAY OUT TO THE BARN TO SAY TO MARILLA AGAIN I THINK YOU OUGHT TO LET ANNE GO MARILLA
WHEN CHARLEMAGNE THE HOLY EMPRISE LOST SO TERRIBLY ORLANDO SOUNDED NOT SHORT WHILE MY HEAD TURNED THITHERWARD I HELD WHEN MANY LOFTY TOWERS I SEEMED TO SEE WHEREAT I
PLACE US BELOW NOR BE DISDAINFUL OF IT
CLAMP NEVER BOUND TOGETHER WOOD WITH WOOD SO STRONGLY WHEREAT THEY LIKE TWO HE GOATS BUTTED TOGETHER SO MUCH WRATH O'ERCAME THEM
PANTING AS ONE FATIGUED MUST WE PERFORCE DEPART FROM SO MUCH EVIL THEN THROUGH THE OPENING OF A ROCK HE ISSUED AND DOWN UPON THE MARGIN SEATED ME
HIS BODY BY A DEMON IS TAKEN FROM HIM WHO THEREAFTER RULES IT UNTIL HIS TIME HAS WHOLLY BEEN REVOLVED
OPENED HIS EYES AND SAID DECIDEDLY WELL NOW MARILLA
ALREADY WE HAD GONE AWAY FROM HIM WHEN I BEHELD TWO FROZEN IN ONE HOLE SO THAT ONE HEAD A HOOD WAS TO THE OTHER
O WHAT A MARVEL IT APPEARED TO ME WHEN I BEHELD THREE FACES ON HIS HEAD THE ONE IN FRONT AND THAT VERMILION WAS TWO WERE THE OTHERS THAT WERE JOINED WITH THIS
LOOK HOW THOU STEPPEST TAKE HEED THOU DO NOT TRAMPLE WITH THY FEET THE HEADS OF THE TIRED MISERABLE BROTHERS WHEREAT I TURNED ME ROUND AND SAW BEFORE ME AND UNDERFOOT A LAKE
AND ALL THE SCHOLARS WERE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN IT BY REASON OF OLDER BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO WERE GOING TO TAKE PART EVERYBODY IN SCHOOL OVER NINE YEARS OF AGE EXPECTED TO GO EXCEPT CARRIE SLOANE
IF THOU SHOULDST QUESTIONED BE WHO ELSE WAS THERE
BUT THIS WAS TO BE A BIG AFFAIR ADMISSION TEN CENTS IN AID OF THE LIBRARY
IT AIN'T INTERFERING TO HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION AND MY OPINION IS THAT YOU OUGHT TO LET ANNE GO
SAID ANNE REPENTANTLY I MAKE SO MANY MISTAKES BUT THEN JUST THINK OF ALL THE MISTAKES I DON'T MAKE ALTHOUGH I MIGHT I'LL GET SOME SAND AND SCRUB UP THE SPOTS BEFORE I GO TO SCHOOL OH MARILLA MY HEART WAS JUST SET ON GOING TO THAT CONCERT I NEVER WAS TO A CONCERT IN MY LIFE
HERE IT IS MORN WHEN IT IS EVENING THERE
SOUL IDIOTIC KEEP TO THY HORN AND VENT THYSELF WITH THAT WHEN WRATH OR OTHER PASSION TOUCHES THEE SEARCH ROUND THY NECK
I GUESS ONCE IS ENOUGH TO SAY THEM
THEREBY
TINKLES OF SLEIGH BELLS AND DISTANT LAUGHTER THAT SEEMED LIKE THE MIRTH OF WOOD ELVES CAME FROM EVERY QUARTER OH DIANA BREATHED ANNE SQUEEZING DIANA'S MITTENED HAND UNDER THE FUR ROBE
ONE AND ALL OF THEM AS WHEN THE FOG IS VANISHING AWAY LITTLE BY LITTLE DOTH THE SIGHT REFIGURE WHATE'ER THE MIST THAT CROWDS THE AIR CONCEALS SO PIERCING THROUGH THE DENSE AND DARKSOME AIR
I'M SURE THE DEBATING CLUB IS A MOST RESPECTABLE AFFAIR PLEADED ANNE I'M NOT SAYING IT ISN'T
AND IF I FREE THEE NOT MAY I GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ICE THEN HE REPLIED
WITH FLOOR UNEVEN AND UNEASE OF LIGHT ERE FROM THE ABYSS I TEAR MYSELF AWAY MY MASTER SAID I WHEN I HAD ARISEN TO DRAW ME FROM AN ERROR SPEAK A LITTLE
IT MUST NEEDS BE THOU NAME THYSELF OR NOT A HAIR REMAIN UPON THEE HERE WHENCE HE TO ME THOUGH THOU STRIP OFF MY HAIR I WILL NOT TELL THEE WHO I AM NOR SHOW THEE
IF ON MY HEAD A THOUSAND TIMES THOU FALL I HAD HIS HAIR IN HAND ALREADY TWISTED
MORE AND MORE NEAR APPROACHING TOW'RD THE VERGE MY ERROR FLED AND FEAR CAME OVER ME BECAUSE AS ON ITS CIRCULAR PARAPETS
THEN TOW'RDS ME HE OUTSTRETCHED HIS WARY STEP I LIFTED UP MINE EYES AND THOUGHT TO SEE LUCIFER IN THE SAME WAY I HAD LEFT HIM AND I BEHELD HIM UPWARD HOLD HIS LEGS
I WOULD PRESS OUT THE JUICE OF MY CONCEPTION MORE FULLY BUT BECAUSE I HAVE THEM NOT NOT WITHOUT FEAR I BRING MYSELF TO SPEAK
WHEN WE WERE COME TO WHERE THE THIGH REVOLVES EXACTLY ON THE THICKNESS OF THE HAUNCH THE GUIDE WITH LABOUR AND WITH HARD DRAWN BREATH
SAID THIS WITH HIS EYES DISTORTED THE WRETCHED SKULL RESUMED HE WITH HIS TEETH WHICH AS A DOG'S UPON THE BONE WERE STRONG AH PISA
OTHER PEOPLE'S CHEEKS SO THAT IF THOU WERT LIVING TWERE TOO MUCH LIVING I AM AND DEAR TO THEE IT MAY BE WAS MY RESPONSE IF THOU DEMANDEST FAME THAT MID THE OTHER NOTES THY NAME I PLACE
SAID ANNE WITH THE AIR OF PRODUCING THE LAST SHOT IN HER LOCKER MISSUS BARRY TOLD DIANA THAT WE MIGHT SLEEP IN THE SPARE ROOM BED
AT EVERY MOUTH HE WITH HIS TEETH WAS CRUNCHING A SINNER IN THE MANNER OF A BRAKE SO THAT HE THREE OF THEM TORMENTED THUS
NOW WAS I AND WITH FEAR IN VERSE I PUT IT THERE WHERE THE SHADES WERE WHOLLY COVERED UP
SHOWED SO MUCH OF HIM ABOVE IT THAT TO REACH UP TO HIS HAIR
DRAW NIGH THAT I MAY TAKE THEE THEN OF HIMSELF AND ME ONE BUNDLE MADE AS SEEMS THE CARISENDA TO BEHOLD BENEATH THE LEANING SIDE WHEN GOES A CLOUD ABOVE IT SO THAT OPPOSITE IT HANGS
HE SHOWED GREAT PROWESS WHAT TIME THE GIANTS TERRIFIED THE GODS THE ARMS HE WIELDED NEVER MORE HE MOVES AND I TO HIM IF POSSIBLE
AND LIFTED UP HIS BROW AGAINST HIS MAKER
TOWARDS US THEREFORE LOOK IN FRONT OF THEE MY MASTER SAID IF THOU DISCERNEST HIM AS WHEN THERE BREATHES A HEAVY FOG OR WHEN OUR HEMISPHERE IS DARKENING INTO NIGHT
MORE JUST AND MORE DISCREET WILL HOLD HER FOR IT FOR WHERE THE ARGUMENT OF INTELLECT IS ADDED UNTO EVIL WILL AND POWER NO RAMPART CAN THE PEOPLE MAKE AGAINST IT
THOU STILL IMAGINEST THOU ART BEYOND THE CENTRE WHERE I GRASPED THE HAIR OF THE FELL WORM WHO MINES THE WORLD THAT SIDE THOU WAST SO LONG AS I DESCENDED
WELL SHALT THOU SEE IF THOU ARRIVEST THERE HOW MUCH THE SENSE DECEIVES ITSELF BY DISTANCE THEREFORE A LITTLE FASTER SPUR THEE ON
AND HE TO ME FOR THE REVERSE I LONG TAKE THYSELF HENCE AND GIVE ME NO MORE TROUBLE FOR ILL THOU KNOWEST TO FLATTER IN THIS HOLLOW THEN BY THE SCALP BEHIND I SEIZED UPON HIM AND SAID
THEY WEPT AND DARLING LITTLE ANSELM MINE SAID THOU DOST GAZE SO FATHER WHAT DOTH AIL THEE STILL NOT A TEAR I SHED NOR ANSWER MADE ALL OF THAT DAY
AND I OF ONE ALREADY SAW THE FACE SHOULDERS AND BREAST AND GREAT PART OF THE BELLY
BECAUSE THE EARLIEST TEARS A CLUSTER FORM AND IN THE MANNER OF A CRYSTAL VISOR FILL ALL THE CUP BENEATH THE EYEBROW FULL AND NOTWITHSTANDING THAT AS IN A CALLUS
I SHOULD WISH THAT OF THE MEASURELESS BRIAREUS THESE EYES OF MINE MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCE WHENCE HE REPLIED THOU SHALT BEHOLD ANTAEUS CLOSE BY HERE
OF WHOM THE GORGET FLORENCE SLIT ASUNDER
SAVE THAT HE SEEMS IN ASPECT MORE FEROCIOUS THERE NEVER WAS AN EARTHQUAKE OF SUCH MIGHT THAT IT COULD SHAKE A TOWER SO VIOLENTLY
AND TO BE RUDE TO HIM WAS COURTESY
FOR I BEHELD THIRTY GREAT PALMS OF HIM DOWN FROM THE PLACE WHERE MAN HIS MANTLE BUCKLES
LET THE CAPRAIA AND GORGONA MOVE AND MAKE A HEDGE ACROSS THE MOUTH OF ARNO THAT EVERY PERSON IN THEE IT MAY DROWN FOR IF COUNT UGOLINO HAD THE FAME OF HAVING IN THY CASTLES THEE BETRAYED
YOU'VE GOT THE LOVELIEST COLOR
WHEN IS DREAMING OF GLEANING OFTENTIMES THE PEASANT GIRL LIVID AS FAR DOWN AS WHERE SHAME APPEARS WERE THE DISCONSOLATE SHADES WITHIN THE ICE SETTING THEIR TEETH UNTO THE NOTE OF STORKS
GADDO THREW HIMSELF DOWN OUTSTRETCHED BEFORE MY FEET SAYING MY FATHER WHY DOST THOU NOT HELP ME

WHO DOES NOT SEE THAT THIS IS A GANG OF GREAT BOYS WITH SUCH A CODE OF HONOR AND SUCH LAX DISCIPLINE AS GREAT BOYS HAVE THE COSTLY CHARM OF THE ANCIENT TRAGEDY AND INDEED OF ALL THE OLD LITERATURE IS THAT THE PERSONS SPEAK SIMPLY
SOME MEN CLASSIFY OBJECTS BY COLOR AND SIZE AND OTHER ACCIDENTS OF APPEARANCE OTHERS BY INTRINSIC LIKENESS OR BY THE RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT

THEIR OWN PIETY EXPLAINS EVERY FACT EVERY WORD HOW EASILY THESE OLD WORSHIPS OF MOSES OF ZOROASTER OF MENU OF SOCRATES DOMESTICATE THEMSELVES IN THE MIND I CANNOT FIND ANY ANTIQUITY IN THEM

THERE IS A RELATION BETWEEN THE HOURS OF OUR LIFE AND THE CENTURIES OF TIME AS THE AIR I BREATHE IS DRAWN FROM THE GREAT REPOSITORIES OF NATURE
OR THE ADVANTAGES OF A MARKET HAD INDUCED TO BUILD TOWNS AGRICULTURE THEREFORE WAS A RELIGIOUS INJUNCTION BECAUSE OF THE PERILS OF THE STATE FROM NOMADISM AND IN THESE LATE AND CIVIL COUNTRIES OF ENGLAND AND AMERICA
OF THAT WHICH IN GRAVE EARNEST THE MIND OF THAT PERIOD TOILED TO ACHIEVE MAGIC AND ALL THAT IS ASCRIBED TO IT
THEY COMBINE THE ENERGY OF MANHOOD WITH THE ENGAGING UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF CHILDHOOD THE ATTRACTION OF THESE MANNERS IS THAT THEY BELONG TO MAN AND ARE KNOWN TO EVERY MAN IN VIRTUE OF HIS BEING ONCE A CHILD

THE NOMADISM IS OF TRADE AND CURIOSITY A PROGRESS CERTAINLY
DO NOT IN THEIR STATELIEST PICTURES IN THE SACERDOTAL THE IMPERIAL PALACES IN THE TRIUMPHS OF WILL OR OF GENIUS ANYWHERE LOSE OUR EAR
IN MY OWN MIND WE ARE ALWAYS COMING UP WITH THE EMPHATIC FACTS OF HISTORY IN OUR PRIVATE EXPERIENCE AND VERIFYING THEM HERE ALL HISTORY BECOMES SUBJECTIVE IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS PROPERLY
WE AS WE READ MUST BECOME GREEKS ROMANS TURKS PRIEST AND KING MARTYR AND EXECUTIONER
OR DRAW A CHILD BY STUDYING THE OUTLINES OF ITS FORM MERELY

DESCRIBES TO EACH READER HIS OWN IDEA DESCRIBES HIS UNATTAINED BUT ATTAINABLE SELF ALL LITERATURE WRITES THE CHARACTER OF THE WISE MAN BOOKS
HIS THOUGHT LIVES ALONG THE WHOLE LINE OF TEMPLES AND SPHINXES AND CATACOMBS PASSES THROUGH THEM ALL WITH SATISFACTION AND THEY LIVE AGAIN TO THE MIND OR ARE NOW
BUT KNOW THAT HE IS GREATER THAN ALL THE GEOGRAPHY AND ALL THE GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD
OR PERHAPS HIS FACILITY IS DEEPER SEATED IN THE INCREASED RANGE OF HIS FACULTIES OF OBSERVATION
FOLLOW THE PASTURAGE FROM MONTH TO MONTH
WHAT ELSE AM I WHO LAUGHED OR WEPT YESTERDAY WHO SLEPT LAST NIGHT LIKE A CORPSE

EVERY THOUGHT EVERY EMOTION WHICH BELONGS TO IT IN APPROPRIATE EVENTS BUT THE THOUGHT IS ALWAYS PRIOR TO THE FACT
THE BETTER FOR HIM HISTORY MUST BE THIS OR IT IS NOTHING EVERY LAW WHICH THE STATE ENACTS INDICATES A FACT IN HUMAN NATURE THAT IS ALL
AND VERIFIES THEM WITH HIS OWN HEAD AND HANDS THE BEAUTIFUL FABLES OF THE GREEKS BEING PROPER CREATIONS OF THE IMAGINATION AND NOT OF THE FANCY ARE UNIVERSAL VERITIES WHAT A RANGE OF MEANINGS AND WHAT PERPETUAL PERTINENCE HAS THE STORY OF PROMETHEUS
WE PUT OURSELVES INTO THE PLACE AND STATE OF THE BUILDER WE REMEMBER THE FOREST DWELLERS THE FIRST TEMPLES THE ADHERENCE TO THE FIRST TYPE AND THE DECORATION OF IT AS THE WEALTH OF THE NATION INCREASED
THE SHOES OF SWIFTNESS THE SWORD OF SHARPNESS THE POWER OF SUBDUING THE ELEMENTS OF USING THE SECRET VIRTUES OF MINERALS
IS THAT CONTINENCE OR CONTENT WHICH FINDS ALL THE ELEMENTS OF LIFE IN ITS OWN SOIL AND
SOFT AND FLUID AS A CLOUD OR THE AIR WHY SHOULD WE BE SUCH HARD PEDANTS AND MAGNIFY A FEW FORMS WHY SHOULD WE MAKE ACCOUNT OF TIME OR OF MAGNITUDE OR OF FIGURE THE SOUL KNOWS THEM NOT
OUR SO CALLED HISTORY IS HOW MANY TIMES WE MUST SAY ROME AND PARIS AND CONSTANTINOPLE WHAT DOES ROME KNOW OF RAT AND LIZARD WHAT ARE OLYMPIADS AND CONSULATES TO THESE NEIGHBORING SYSTEMS OF BEING NAY
AND THE FURROWS OF THE BROW SUGGESTED THE STRATA OF THE ROCK THERE ARE MEN WHOSE MANNERS HAVE THE SAME ESSENTIAL SPLENDOR AS THE SIMPLE AND AWFUL SCULPTURE ON THE FRIEZES OF THE PARTHENON AND THE REMAINS OF THE EARLIEST GREEK ART
FOR THIS IS THE ONLY AND SOVEREIGN AGENT OF THE WORKS OF THIS MIND HISTORY IS THE RECORD ITS GENIUS IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE ENTIRE SERIES OF DAYS
SO THAT WHEN ART CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF NATURE IT COULD NOT MOVE ON A SMALL SCALE WITHOUT DEGRADING ITSELF WHAT WOULD STATUES OF THE USUAL SIZE OR NEAT PORCHES AND WINGS HAVE BEEN
AND THIS INTELLECTUAL NOMADISM
YOU SHALL MAKE ME FEEL WHAT PERIODS YOU HAVE LIVED A MAN SHALL BE THE TEMPLE OF FAME HE SHALL WALK AS THE POETS HAVE DESCRIBED THAT GODDESS IN A ROBE PAINTED ALL OVER WITH WONDERFUL EVENTS AND EXPERIENCES
HIS OWN FORM AND FEATURES BY THEIR EXALTED INTELLIGENCE SHALL BE THAT VARIEGATED VEST
AND LIVE APART FROM HIM AND INDEPENDENT OF HIM THE PROMETHEUS VINCTUS IS THE ROMANCE OF SKEPTICISM NOT LESS TRUE TO ALL TIME ARE THE DETAILS OF THAT STATELY APOLOGUE
SEE IN GOETHE'S HELENA THE SAME DESIRE THAT EVERY WORD SHOULD BE A THING THESE FIGURES HE WOULD SAY
IN MAN WE STILL TRACE THE REMAINS OR HINTS OF ALL THAT WE ESTEEM BADGES OF SERVITUDE IN THE LOWER RACES YET IN HIM THEY ENHANCE HIS NOBLENESS AND GRACE
WHEN THE GODS COME AMONG MEN THEY ARE NOT KNOWN JESUS WAS NOT SOCRATES AND SHAKSPEARE WERE NOT ANTAEUS WAS SUFFOCATED BY THE GRIPE OF HERCULES BUT EVERY TIME HE TOUCHED HIS MOTHER EARTH HIS STRENGTH WAS RENEWED
BY SURROUNDING OURSELVES WITH THE ORIGINAL CIRCUMSTANCES WE INVENT ANEW THE ORDERS AND THE ORNAMENTS OF ARCHITECTURE
IF NOT STIMULATED BY FOREIGN INFUSIONS
ENTER THE OLD PILES OF OXFORD AND THE ENGLISH CATHEDRALS WITHOUT FEELING THAT THE FOREST OVERPOWERED THE MIND OF THE BUILDER AND THAT HIS CHISEL HIS SAW AND PLANE STILL REPRODUCED ITS FERNS ITS SPIKES OF FLOWERS ITS LOCUST
THE GOTHIC CHURCH PLAINLY ORIGINATED IN A RUDE ADAPTATION OF THE FOREST TREES
BY INFINITE DIAMETERS GENIUS WATCHES THE MONAD THROUGH ALL HIS MASKS AS HE PERFORMS THE METEMPSYCHOSIS OF NATURE GENIUS DETECTS THROUGH THE FLY THROUGH THE CATERPILLAR
IN IT EXISTED THOSE HUMAN FORMS WHICH SUPPLIED THE SCULPTOR WITH HIS MODELS OF HERCULES PHOEBUS AND JOVE
EVERY ONE MUST HAVE OBSERVED FACES AND FORMS WHICH WITHOUT ANY RESEMBLING FEATURE MAKE A LIKE IMPRESSION ON THE BEHOLDER
AND THERE ARE COMPOSITIONS OF THE SAME STRAIN TO BE FOUND IN THE BOOKS OF ALL AGES WHAT IS GUIDO'S ROSPIGLIOSI AURORA BUT A MORNING THOUGHT AS THE HORSES IN IT ARE ONLY A MORNING CLOUD IF ANY ONE WILL BUT TAKE PAINS TO OBSERVE THE VARIETY OF ACTIONS
ANY MORE THAN HE CAN DRAW TO DAY THE FACE OF A PERSON WHOM HE SHALL SEE TO MORROW FOR THE FIRST TIME I WILL NOT NOW GO BEHIND THE GENERAL STATEMENT TO EXPLORE THE REASON OF THIS CORRESPONDENCY LET IT SUFFICE THAT IN THE LIGHT OF THESE TWO FACTS NAMELY
OUR PROXY HAS DONE ALL INQUIRY INTO ANTIQUITY
WHAT IS HISTORY SAID NAPOLEON BUT A FABLE AGREED UPON THIS LIFE OF OURS IS STUCK ROUND WITH EGYPT GREECE GAUL ENGLAND WAR COLONIZATION CHURCH COURT AND COMMERCE
TO SUSA IN SUMMER AND TO BABYLON FOR THE WINTER
WILL YET SUPERINDUCE THE SAME SENTIMENT
I WILL NOT MAKE MORE ACCOUNT OF THEM I BELIEVE IN ETERNITY I CAN FIND GREECE ASIA ITALY SPAIN AND THE ISLANDS
IN OLD ROME THE PUBLIC ROADS BEGINNING AT THE FORUM PROCEEDED NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST TO THE CENTRE OF EVERY PROVINCE OF THE EMPIRE MAKING EACH MARKET TOWN OF PERSIA SPAIN AND BRITAIN PERVIOUS TO THE SOLDIERS OF THE CAPITAL
HIS SUBSTANCE IS NOT HERE FOR WHAT YOU SEE IS BUT THE SMALLEST PART AND LEAST PROPORTION OF HUMANITY
ARE INVIGORATED BY HABITS OF CONVERSATION WITH NATURE THE POWER OF MUSIC THE POWER OF POETRY TO UNFIX AND AS IT WERE CLAP WINGS TO SOLID NATURE INTERPRETS THE RIDDLE OF ORPHEUS
MORE THAN ONCE SOME INDIVIDUAL HAS APPEARED TO ME WITH SUCH NEGLIGENCE OF LABOR AND SUCH COMMANDING CONTEMPLATION A HAUGHTY BENEFICIARY BEGGING IN THE NAME OF GOD AS MADE GOOD TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY SIMEON THE STYLITE
ALONG THE SIDES OF THE STONE WALL WHICH OBVIOUSLY GAVE THE IDEA OF THE COMMON ARCHITECTURAL SCROLL
EXPLAINED TO THE CHILD WHEN HE BECOMES A MAN ONLY BY SEEING THAT THE OPPRESSOR OF HIS YOUTH IS HIMSELF A CHILD TYRANNIZED OVER BY THOSE NAMES AND WORDS AND FORMS OF WHOSE INFLUENCE HE WAS MERELY THE ORGAN TO THE YOUTH
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT COMMON SOULS PAY WITH WHAT THEY DO NOBLER SOULS WITH THAT WHICH THEY ARE AND WHY BECAUSE A PROFOUND NATURE AWAKENS IN US BY ITS ACTIONS AND WORDS BY ITS VERY LOOKS AND MANNERS
AT THE TRIUMPH OF THE GENTLE VENELAS AND INDEED ALL THE POSTULATES OF ELFIN ANNALS THAT THE FAIRIES DO NOT LIKE TO BE NAMED THAT THEIR GIFTS ARE CAPRICIOUS AND NOT TO BE TRUSTED THAT WHO SEEKS A TREASURE MUST NOT SPEAK AND THE LIKE
IT IS THE SPIRIT AND NOT THE FACT THAT IS IDENTICAL BY A DEEPER APPREHENSION
YONDER SLIP OF A BOY THAT READS IN THE CORNER FEELS TO BE TRUE OF HIMSELF WE SYMPATHIZE IN THE GREAT MOMENTS OF HISTORY IN THE GREAT DISCOVERIES THE GREAT RESISTANCES
STILL INDICATE THE GREEN WITHES THAT TIED THEM NO ONE CAN WALK IN A ROAD
FROM ROME AND ATHENS AND LONDON TO HIMSELF AND NOT DENY HIS CONVICTION THAT HE IS THE COURT AND IF ENGLAND OR EGYPT HAVE ANY THING TO SAY TO HIM HE WILL TRY THE CASE
WHAT DO I KNOW SYMPATHETICALLY MORALLY OF EITHER OF THESE WORLDS OF LIFE AS OLD AS THE CAUCASIAN MAN PERHAPS OLDER
IS EXPOUNDED IN THE INDIVIDUAL'S PRIVATE LIFE THE CRAMPING INFLUENCE OF A HARD FORMALIST ON A YOUNG CHILD IN REPRESSING HIS SPIRITS AND COURAGE
BABYLON TROY TYRE PALESTINE AND EVEN EARLY ROME ARE PASSING ALREADY INTO FICTION THE GARDEN OF EDEN THE SUN STANDING STILL IN GIBEON
AND YIELD ITS OWN VIRTUE TO HIM HE SHOULD SEE THAT HE CAN LIVE ALL HISTORY IN HIS OWN PERSON HE MUST SIT SOLIDLY AT HOME AND NOT SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE BULLIED BY KINGS OR EMPIRES
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WITH NOTHING OF THE METAMORPHOSIS LEFT BUT THE LUNAR HORNS AS THE SPLENDID ORNAMENT OF HER BROWS THE IDENTITY OF HISTORY IS EQUALLY INTRINSIC THE DIVERSITY EQUALLY OBVIOUS
MY LADY DEDLOCK'S PLACE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DREARY THE WEATHER FOR MANY A DAY AND NIGHT HAS BEEN SO WET THAT THE TREES SEEM WET THROUGH
IN HIM INDEED HE MARRIED HER FOR LOVE A WHISPER STILL GOES ABOUT THAT SHE HAD NOT EVEN FAMILY
THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OUGHT TO BE SITTING HERE AS HERE HE IS WITH A FOGGY GLORY ROUND HIS HEAD SOFTLY FENCED IN WITH CRIMSON CLOTH AND CURTAINS ADDRESSED
IT HAS BEEN DEATH TO MANY BUT IT IS A JOKE IN THE PROFESSION EVERY MASTER IN CHANCERY HAS HAD A REFERENCE OUT OF IT EVERY CHANCELLOR WAS IN IT FOR SOMEBODY OR OTHER WHEN HE WAS COUNSEL AT THE BAR
INTO THE FREEZING MOOD AN EXHAUSTED COMPOSURE A WORN OUT PLACIDITY AN EQUANIMITY OF FATIGUE NOT TO BE RUFFLED BY INTEREST OR SATISFACTION ARE THE TROPHIES OF HER VICTORY
WHICH HAS ITS RUINED SUITOR WITH HIS SLIPSHOD HEELS AND THREADBARE DRESS BORROWING AND BEGGING THROUGH THE ROUND OF EVERY MAN'S ACQUAINTANCE WHICH GIVES TO MONIED MIGHT THE MEANS ABUNDANTLY OF WEARYING OUT THE RIGHT
IT IS A DEADENED WORLD AND ITS GROWTH IS SOMETIMES UNHEALTHY FOR WANT OF AIR MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS RETURNED TO HER HOUSE IN TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS PREVIOUS TO HER DEPARTURE FOR PARIS
HE IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY EVER TO DO IN THE MEANTIME HIS PROSPECTS IN LIFE ARE ENDED ANOTHER RUINED SUITOR WHO PERIODICALLY APPEARS FROM SHROPSHIRE AND BREAKS OUT INTO EFFORTS
AND AT HER HOUSE IN TOWN UPON THIS MUDDY MURKY AFTERNOON PRESENTS HIMSELF AN OLD FASHIONED OLD GENTLEMAN ATTORNEY AT LAW AND EKE SOLICITOR OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY
FAIRY LAND TO VISIT BUT A DESERT TO LIVE IN THE OLD GENTLEMAN IS CONDUCTED BY A MERCURY IN POWDER TO MY LADY'S PRESENCE
BUT THIS WAS EXAGGERATED AND HAD BEEN ENTIRELY OWING TO THE PARSIMONY OF THE PUBLIC WHICH GUILTY PUBLIC IT APPEARED HAD BEEN UNTIL LATELY BENT IN THE MOST DETERMINED MANNER
AND ITS SMOKE MOVES IN A TARDY LITTLE CLOUD TOWARDS THE GREEN RISE COPPICE TOPPED THAT MAKES A BACKGROUND FOR THE FALLING RAIN THE VIEW FROM MY LADY DEDLOCK'S OWN WINDOWS
WHAT HAS BEEN DOING AND STILL IS DOING IN THIS CONNEXION I MENTION HERE THAT EVERYTHING SET FORTH IN THESE PAGES CONCERNING THE COURT OF CHANCERY IS SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE
MAY HAVE GOT AN EXTRA MORAL TWIST AND SHUFFLE INTO THEMSELVES OUT OF JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE THE RECEIVER IN THE CAUSE HAS ACQUIRED A GOODLY SUM OF MONEY BY IT BUT HAS ACQUIRED TOO A DISTRUST OF HIS OWN MOTHER
BY A LARGE ADVOCATE WITH GREAT WHISKERS A LITTLE VOICE AND AN INTERMINABLE BRIEF AND OUTWARDLY DIRECTING HIS CONTEMPLATION TO THE LANTERN IN THE ROOF WHERE HE CAN SEE NOTHING BUT FOG
THE OLD GENTLEMAN IS RUSTY TO LOOK AT BUT IS REPUTED TO HAVE MADE GOOD THRIFT OUT OF ARISTOCRATIC MARRIAGE SETTLEMENTS AND ARISTOCRATIC WILLS AND TO BE VERY RICH
FRENCH ENGLISH AND SCOTCH IN MORE MODERN DAYS CONTENTING MYSELF WITH OBSERVING THAT I SHALL NOT ABANDON THE FACTS UNTIL THERE SHALL HAVE BEEN A CONSIDERABLE SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION OF THE TESTIMONY ON WHICH HUMAN OCCURRENCES
THAT IT IS A WORLD WRAPPED UP IN TOO MUCH JEWELLER'S COTTON AND FINE WOOL AND CANNOT HEAR THE RUSHING OF THE LARGER WORLDS AND CANNOT SEE THEM AS THEY CIRCLE ROUND THE SUN
WHERE HER LADYSHIP INTENDS TO STAY SOME WEEKS AFTER WHICH HER MOVEMENTS ARE UNCERTAIN THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE SAYS SO
OR WHATEVER THEY MAY BE IN LEGAL COURT SUITS THESE ARE ALL YAWNING FOR NO CRUMB OF AMUSEMENT EVER FALLS FROM JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE THE CAUSE IN HAND
AT THE VERY HEART OF THE FOG SITS THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR IN HIS HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY NEVER CAN THERE COME FOG TOO THICK NEVER CAN THERE COME MUD AND MIRE TOO DEEP
AND IF IT BE NOT IN ITS HEYDAY IT IS NOT YET IN ITS AUTUMN SHE HAS A FINE FACE ORIGINALLY OF A CHARACTER THAT WOULD BE RATHER CALLED VERY PRETTY THAN HANDSOME
WHEN ALL THE STOPPED SPITS IN THE KITCHEN SHALL BEGIN TO TURN PRODIGIOUSLY IT IS NOT A LARGE WORLD RELATIVELY EVEN TO THIS WORLD OF OURS WHICH HAS ITS LIMITS TOO
AND HOLDS HER PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS IN THE HIGHEST ESTIMATION HIS GALLANTRY TO MY LADY WHICH HAS NEVER CHANGED SINCE HE COURTED HER
IS OMNISCIENT OF THE PAST AND PRESENT BUT NOT THE FUTURE CANNOT YET UNDERTAKE TO SAY SIR LEICESTER DEDLOCK IS ONLY A BARONET
SINCE OLD TOM JARNDYCE IN DESPAIR BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT AT A COFFEE HOUSE IN CHANCERY LANE BUT JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE STILL DRAGS ITS DREARY LENGTH BEFORE THE COURT PERENNIALLY HOPELESS
RINGING IN THE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF THE VERY LITTLE COUNSEL DROPS AND THE FOG KNOWS HIM NO MORE EVERYBODY LOOKS FOR HIM NOBODY CAN SEE HIM I WILL SPEAK WITH BOTH THE YOUNG PEOPLE
SMOKE LOWERING DOWN FROM CHIMNEY POTS MAKING A SOFT BLACK DRIZZLE WITH FLAKES OF SOOT IN IT AS BIG AS FULL GROWN SNOWFLAKES GONE INTO MOURNING ONE MIGHT IMAGINE FOR THE DEATH OF THE SUN
SAYS THE CHANCELLOR ANEW AND SATISFY MYSELF ON THE SUBJECT OF THEIR RESIDING WITH THEIR COUSIN
BY GIUSEPPE BIANCHINI A PREBENDARY OF VERONA OTHERWISE DISTINGUISHED IN LETTERS WHO PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF IT AT VERONA IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WHICH HE AFTERWARDS REPUBLISHED AT ROME
THE MOST IS MADE AS THE HONOURABLE BOB STABLES HAS FREQUENTLY ASSERTED UPON OATH OF ALL HER POINTS THE SAME AUTHORITY OBSERVES THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY GOT UP
IT IS NOT SO UNLIKE THE COURT OF CHANCERY BUT THAT WE MAY PASS FROM THE ONE SCENE TO THE OTHER AS THE CROW FLIES BOTH THE WORLD OF FASHION AND THE COURT OF CHANCERY
THE SHORT HAND WRITERS THE REPORTERS OF THE COURT AND THE REPORTERS OF THE NEWSPAPERS INVARIABLY DECAMP WITH THE REST OF THE REGULARS WHEN JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE COMES ON THEIR PLACES ARE A BLANK
UPON WHOSE IMPALING FILES REAMS OF DUSTY WARRANTS
SIR LEICESTER IS TWENTY YEARS FULL MEASURE OLDER THAN MY LADY HE WILL NEVER SEE SIXTY FIVE AGAIN NOR PERHAPS SIXTY SIX NOR YET SIXTY SEVEN
FULLY INFLATED IN THE BACK SETTLEMENTS OF THE FOG AND SAYS WILL YOUR LORDSHIP ALLOW ME I APPEAR FOR HIM HE IS A COUSIN SEVERAL TIMES REMOVED I AM NOT AT THE MOMENT PREPARED TO INFORM THE COURT
AND ADMIT NO LIGHT OF DAY INTO THE PLACE WELL MAY THE UNINITIATED FROM THE STREETS WHO PEEP IN THROUGH THE GLASS PANES IN THE DOOR BE DETERRED FROM ENTRANCE BY ITS OWLISH ASPECT
AND WERE CONSTANTLY BEING JUGGLED THROUGH THE WHOLE SET ACROSS THE HALL AND UP THE STAIRS AND ALONG THE PASSAGES AND THROUGH THE ROOMS WHICH ARE VERY BRILLIANT IN THE SEASON AND VERY DISMAL OUT OF IT
THE SUBJECT WAS A WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND WAS IGNORANTLY CONVICTED OF HAVING MURDERED HER BUT ON SOLEMN APPEAL TO A HIGHER COURT HE WAS ACQUITTED BECAUSE IT WAS SHOWN UPON THE EVIDENCE
FAIR WARDS OF COURT HAVE FADED INTO MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS A LONG PROCESSION OF CHANCELLORS HAS COME IN AND GONE OUT THE LEGION OF BILLS IN THE SUIT HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO MERE BILLS OF MORTALITY
AITS AND MEADOWS FOG DOWN THE RIVER WHERE IT ROLLS DEFILED AMONG THE TIERS OF SHIPPING AND THE WATERSIDE POLLUTIONS OF A GREAT AND DIRTY CITY FOG ON THE ESSEX MARSHES FOG ON THE KENTISH HEIGHTS
HE WOULD ON THE WHOLE ADMIT NATURE TO BE A GOOD IDEA A LITTLE LOW PERHAPS WHEN NOT ENCLOSED WITH A PARK FENCE BUT AN IDEA DEPENDENT FOR ITS EXECUTION
THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT IS CALLED SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION HAS BEEN DENIED SINCE THE DEATH OF MISTER KROOK AND MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER LEWES
WITH ONE OR OTHER OF WHOM I THINK IT MUST HAVE ORIGINATED IN SUCH MOUTHS I MIGHT HAVE COUPLED IT WITH AN APT QUOTATION FROM ONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS MY NATURE IS SUBDUED
TO ADDRESS THE CHANCELLOR AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY'S BUSINESS AND WHO CAN BY NO MEANS BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS LEGALLY IGNORANT OF HIS EXISTENCE AFTER MAKING IT DESOLATE
OF SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION IS GIVEN I DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO ADD TO THESE NOTABLE FACTS AND THAT GENERAL REFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES WHICH WILL BE FOUND AT PAGE
MY LORD BUT THE CHANCELLOR BEING AWARE OF HIM HAS DEXTEROUSLY VANISHED EVERYBODY ELSE QUICKLY VANISHES TOO
HOW MANY PEOPLE OUT OF THE SUIT JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE HAS STRETCHED FORTH ITS UNWHOLESOME HAND TO SPOIL AND CORRUPT WOULD BE A VERY WIDE QUESTION FROM THE MASTER
AND IT WOULD NOT BE WONDERFUL TO MEET A MEGALOSAURUS FORTY FEET LONG OR SO
AND ALWAYS EXPECTING SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE JUDGMENT TO BE GIVEN IN HER FAVOUR
THE MAN FROM SHROPSHIRE CRIES MY LORD MACES BAGS AND PURSES INDIGNANTLY PROCLAIM SILENCE AND FROWN AT THE MAN FROM SHROPSHIRE IN REFERENCE PROCEEDS THE CHANCELLOR
STILL ON JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE TO THE YOUNG GIRL BEGLUDSHIP'S PARDON BOY SAYS MISTER TANGLE PREMATURELY
AND REMARKS IN COMMENDATION OF HER HAIR ESPECIALLY THAT SHE IS THE BEST GROOMED WOMAN IN THE WHOLE STUD WITH ALL HER PERFECTIONS ON HER HEAD MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS COME UP FROM HER PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE
ON SUCH AN AFTERNOON SOME SCORE OF MEMBERS OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY BAR OUGHT TO BE AS HERE THEY ARE MISTILY ENGAGED IN ONE OF THE TEN THOUSAND STAGES OF AN ENDLESS CAUSE
JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE HAS PASSED INTO A JOKE
BUT NO ONE KNOWS FOR CERTAIN BECAUSE NO ONE CARES SHE CARRIES SOME SMALL LITTER IN A RETICULE WHICH SHE CALLS HER DOCUMENTS PRINCIPALLY CONSISTING OF PAPER MATCHES AND DRY LAVENDER
GAS LOOMING THROUGH THE FOG IN DIVERS PLACES IN THE STREETS MUCH AS THE SUN MAY FROM THE SPONGEY FIELDS BE SEEN TO LOOM BY HUSBANDMAN AND PLOUGHBOY
MISTER TANGLE SAYS THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR LATTERLY SOMETHING RESTLESS UNDER THE ELOQUENCE OF THAT LEARNED GENTLEMAN MLUD SAYS MISTER TANGLE MISTER TANGLE KNOWS MORE OF JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE THAN ANYBODY
AND FOR YEARS NOW MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS BEEN AT THE CENTRE OF THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE AND AT THE TOP OF THE FASHIONABLE TREE HOW ALEXANDER WEPT WHEN HE HAD NO MORE WORLDS TO CONQUER
LUDSHIP IS THE REPLY THAT SLIDES OUT OF MISTER TANGLE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE BAR ARE STILL TO BE HEARD I BELIEVE SAYS THE CHANCELLOR WITH A SLIGHT SMILE
WHO ARE NEVER IN ANY CAUSE AND THE WELL OF SOLICITORS BEFORE MENTIONED THERE IS THE REGISTRAR BELOW THE JUDGE IN WIG AND GOWN AND THERE ARE TWO OR THREE MACES OR PETTY BAGS OR PRIVY PURSES
IS ALTERNATELY A LEAD COLOURED VIEW AND A VIEW IN INDIAN INK THE VASES ON THE STONE TERRACE IN THE FOREGROUND CATCH THE RAIN ALL DAY AND THE HEAVY DROPS FALL DRIP DRIP DRIP
I WILL SEE THEM AND SATISFY MYSELF AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF MAKING THE ORDER FOR THEIR RESIDING WITH THEIR UNCLE MISTER TANGLE ON HIS LEGS AGAIN BEGLUDSHIP'S PARDON DEAD WITH THEIR
NEAR THAT LEADEN HEADED OLD OBSTRUCTION APPROPRIATE ORNAMENT FOR THE THRESHOLD OF A LEADEN HEADED OLD CORPORATION TEMPLE BAR AND HARD BY TEMPLE BAR IN LINCOLN'S INN HALL
I HAVE NO NEED TO OBSERVE THAT I DO NOT WILFULLY OR NEGLIGENTLY MISLEAD MY READERS AND THAT BEFORE I WROTE THAT DESCRIPTION I TOOK PAINS TO INVESTIGATE THE SUBJECT
ON BY NO MEANS ENLARGING THE NUMBER OF CHANCERY JUDGES APPOINTED I BELIEVE BY RICHARD THE SECOND BUT ANY OTHER KING WILL DO AS WELL THIS SEEMED TO ME TOO PROFOUND A JOKE TO BE INSERTED IN THE BODY OF THIS BOOK
WELL MAY THE COURT BE DIM WITH WASTING CANDLES HERE AND THERE WELL MAY THE FOG HANG HEAVY IN IT AS IF IT WOULD NEVER GET OUT WELL MAY THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS
HE IS SURROUNDED BY A MYSTERIOUS HALO OF FAMILY CONFIDENCES OF WHICH HE IS KNOWN TO BE THE SILENT DEPOSITORY
AS THE HOUSEKEEPER HAS PASSED ALONG THE OLD ROOMS SHUTTING UP THE SHUTTERS AND WHEN THEY WILL NEXT COME FORTH AGAIN THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE WHICH LIKE THE FIEND
TO WHAT IT WORKS IN LIKE THE DYER'S HAND PITY ME THEN AND WISH I WERE RENEWED BUT AS IT IS WHOLESOME THAT THE PARSIMONIOUS PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW
NOT YET DECIDED WHICH WAS COMMENCED BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY AND IN WHICH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SEVENTY THOUSAND POUNDS HAS BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN COSTS IF I WANTED OTHER AUTHORITIES FOR JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE
WHO HAS THE HONOUR OF ACTING AS LEGAL ADVISER OF THE DEDLOCKS AND HAS AS MANY CAST IRON BOXES IN HIS OFFICE WITH THAT NAME OUTSIDE AS IF THE PRESENT BARONET WERE THE COIN OF THE CONJUROR'S TRICK
ON YOUR GREAT COUNTY FAMILIES HE IS A GENTLEMAN OF STRICT CONSCIENCE DISDAINFUL OF ALL LITTLENESS AND MEANNESS AND READY ON THE SHORTEST NOTICE TO DIE ANY DEATH YOU MAY PLEASE TO MENTION
AT A KEEPER'S LODGE AND SEEING THE LIGHT OF A FIRE UPON THE LATTICED PANES AND SMOKE RISING FROM THE CHIMNEY AND A CHILD CHASED BY A WOMAN RUNNING OUT INTO THE RAIN
THE APPEARANCES BEYOND ALL RATIONAL DOUBT OBSERVED IN THAT CASE ARE THE APPEARANCES OBSERVED IN MISTER KROOK'S CASE THE NEXT MOST FAMOUS
HIS FAMILY IS AS OLD AS THE HILLS AND INFINITELY MORE RESPECTABLE HE HAS A GENERAL OPINION THAT THE WORLD MIGHT GET ON WITHOUT HILLS BUT WOULD BE DONE UP WITHOUT DEDLOCKS
AND ARE COME TO THE BRINK OF THE VOID BEYOND IT IS A VERY LITTLE SPECK THERE IS MUCH GOOD IN IT THERE ARE MANY GOOD AND TRUE PEOPLE IN IT IT HAS ITS APPOINTED PLACE BUT THE EVIL OF IT IS
FOR HALF A MILE IN BREADTH IS A STAGNANT RIVER WITH MELANCHOLY TREES FOR ISLANDS IN IT AND A SURFACE PUNCTURED ALL OVER ALL DAY LONG WITH FALLING RAIN
FOG CREEPING INTO THE CABOOSES OF COLLIER BRIGS FOG LYING OUT ON THE YARDS AND HOVERING IN THE RIGGING OF GREAT SHIPS FOG DROOPING ON THE GUNWALES OF BARGES AND SMALL BOATS
DOGS UNDISTINGUISHABLE IN MIRE HORSES SCARCELY BETTER SPLASHED TO THEIR VERY BLINKERS FOOT PASSENGERS JOSTLING ONE ANOTHER'S UMBRELLAS IN A GENERAL INFECTION OF ILL TEMPER
WITH ANY MORE BUT SHE HAD BEAUTY PRIDE AMBITION INSOLENT RESOLVE AND SENSE ENOUGH TO PORTION OUT A LEGION OF FINE LADIES WEALTH AND STATION ADDED TO THESE SOON FLOATED HER UPWARD
SCORES OF PERSONS HAVE DELIRIOUSLY FOUND THEMSELVES MADE PARTIES IN JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE WITHOUT KNOWING HOW OR WHY WHOLE FAMILIES HAVE INHERITED LEGENDARY HATREDS WITH THE SUIT
A SALLOW PRISONER HAS COME UP IN CUSTODY
WHO SAID THAT SUCH A THING MIGHT HAPPEN WHEN THE SKY RAINED POTATOES HE OBSERVED OR WHEN WE GET THROUGH JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE MISTER BLOWERS A PLEASANTRY THAT PARTICULARLY TICKLED THE MACES BAGS AND PURSES
AND BY THE DRAWL LANGUIDLY ECHOING TO THE ROOF FROM THE PADDED DAIS WHERE THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR LOOKS INTO THE LANTERN THAT HAS NO LIGHT IN IT AND WHERE THE ATTENDANT WIGS ARE ALL STUCK IN A FOG BANK
IN WHAT EXACT REMOVE HE IS A COUSIN BUT HE IS A COUSIN LEAVING THIS ADDRESS
FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY PLANTS HIMSELF IN A GOOD PLACE AND KEEPS AN EYE ON THE JUDGE READY TO CALL OUT MY LORD IN A VOICE OF SONOROUS COMPLAINT ON THE INSTANT OF HIS RISING
I COULD RAIN THEM ON THESE PAGES TO THE SHAME OF A PARSIMONIOUS PUBLIC THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER POINT ON WHICH I OFFER A WORD OF REMARK
AND THERE IS A GENERAL SMELL AND TASTE AS OF THE ANCIENT DEDLOCKS IN THEIR GRAVES MY LADY DEDLOCK WHO IS CHILDLESS LOOKING OUT IN THE EARLY TWILIGHT FROM HER BOUDOIR
ARTICLED CLERKS HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF FLESHING THEIR LEGAL WIT UPON IT THE LAST LORD CHANCELLOR HANDLED IT NEATLY
AND LOSING THEIR FOOT HOLD AT STREET CORNERS WHERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER FOOT PASSENGERS HAVE BEEN SLIPPING AND SLIDING SINCE THE DAY BROKE IF THIS DAY EVER BROKE ADDING NEW DEPOSITS TO THE CRUST
OR I SHOULD HAVE RESTORED IT
UPON CRUST OF MUD STICKING AT THOSE POINTS TENACIOUSLY TO THE PAVEMENT AND ACCUMULATING AT COMPOUND INTEREST FOG EVERYWHERE FOG UP THE RIVER WHERE IT FLOWS AMONG GREEN
IT IS BUT A GLIMPSE OF THE WORLD OF FASHION
TO ASSORT WITH THE GROPING AND FLOUNDERING CONDITION WHICH THIS HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY MOST PESTILENT OF HOARY SINNERS HOLDS THIS DAY IN THE SIGHT OF HEAVEN AND EARTH ON SUCH AN AFTERNOON IF EVER
ARE THINGS OF PRECEDENT AND USAGE OVERSLEEPING RIP VAN WINKLES WHO HAVE PLAYED AT STRANGE GAMES THROUGH A DEAL OF THUNDERY WEATHER SLEEPING BEAUTIES WHOM THE KNIGHT WILL WAKE ONE DAY
HER PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE THE WATERS ARE OUT IN LINCOLNSHIRE AN ARCH OF THE BRIDGE IN THE PARK HAS BEEN SAPPED AND SOPPED AWAY THE ADJACENT LOW LYING GROUND
A MERE BUD ON THE FOREST TREE OF THE PARENT SUIT AND REALLY WILL COME TO A SETTLEMENT ONE OF THESE DAYS THE CHANCELLOR RISES THE BAR RISES THE PRISONER IS BROUGHT
THE CHANCELLOR IS ABOUT TO BOW TO THE BAR WHEN THE PRISONER IS PRESENTED NOTHING CAN POSSIBLY COME OF THE PRISONER'S CONGLOMERATION BUT HIS BEING SENT BACK TO PRISON WHICH IS SOON DONE
EVERYBODY KNOWS OR HAS SOME REASON TO KNOW BY THIS TIME THE MATTER HAVING BEEN RATHER FREQUENTLY MENTIONED MY LADY DEDLOCK HAVING CONQUERED HER WORLD FELL NOT INTO THE MELTING BUT RATHER
THAN WHEN IT WAS BEGUN
A FEW LAWYERS CLERKS AND OTHERS WHO KNOW THIS SUITOR BY SIGHT LINGER ON THE CHANCE OF HIS FURNISHING SOME FUN AND ENLIVENING THE DISMAL WEATHER A LITTLE JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE DRONES ON
THIS IS THE COURT OF CHANCERY WHICH HAS ITS DECAYING HOUSES AND ITS BLIGHTED LANDS IN EVERY SHIRE WHICH HAS ITS WORN OUT LUNATIC IN EVERY MADHOUSE AND ITS DEAD IN EVERY CHURCHYARD
AT WHICH POINT I THOUGHT THE JUDGE'S EYE HAD A CAST IN MY DIRECTION WAS ALMOST IMMACULATE THERE HAD BEEN HE ADMITTED A TRIVIAL BLEMISH OR SO IN ITS RATE OF PROGRESS
AND THE SOFT LOPPINGS AND PRUNINGS OF THE WOODMAN'S AXE CAN MAKE NO CRASH OR CRACKLE AS THEY FALL THE DEER LOOKING SOAKED LEAVE QUAGMIRES WHERE THEY PASS
RATHER THAN GIVE OCCASION FOR THE LEAST IMPEACHMENT OF HIS INTEGRITY HE IS AN HONOURABLE OBSTINATE TRUTHFUL HIGH SPIRITED INTENSELY PREJUDICED PERFECTLY UNREASONABLE MAN
MAKE EIGHTEEN BOWS AND DROP INTO THEIR EIGHTEEN PLACES OF OBSCURITY WE WILL PROCEED WITH THE HEARING ON WEDNESDAY FORTNIGHT SAYS THE CHANCELLOR FOR THE QUESTION AT ISSUE IS ONLY A QUESTION OF COSTS
MICHAELMAS TERM LATELY OVER AND THE LORD CHANCELLOR SITTING IN LINCOLN'S INN HALL IMPLACABLE NOVEMBER WEATHER AS MUCH MUD IN THE STREETS AS IF THE WATERS HAD BUT NEWLY RETIRED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH
TO THE YOUNG GIRL AND BOY THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE MISTER TANGLE CRUSHED WHOM I DIRECTED TO BE IN ATTENDANCE TO DAY AND WHO ARE NOW IN MY PRIVATE ROOM
TO MAKE A PERSONAL APPLICATION TO PURGE HIMSELF OF HIS CONTEMPT WHICH BEING A SOLITARY SURVIVING EXECUTOR WHO HAS FALLEN INTO A STATE OF CONGLOMERATION ABOUT ACCOUNTS OF WHICH IT IS NOT PRETENDED THAT HE HAD EVER ANY KNOWLEDGE
UPON THE BROAD FLAGGED PAVEMENT CALLED FROM OLD TIME THE GHOST'S WALK ALL NIGHT ON SUNDAYS THE LITTLE CHURCH IN THE PARK IS MOULDY
SUFFER ANY WRONG THAT CAN BE DONE YOU RATHER THAN COME HERE WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN THE LORD CHANCELLOR'S COURT THIS MURKY AFTERNOON BESIDES THE LORD CHANCELLOR THE COUNSEL IN THE CAUSE TWO OR THREE COUNSEL
SIX YEARS EARLIER AND THE HISTORIAN IN THAT CASE IS LE CAT
OUGHT TO BE AS ARE THEY NOT RANGED IN A LINE IN A LONG MATTED WELL BUT YOU MIGHT LOOK IN VAIN FOR TRUTH AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
I WILL SET BEFORE HIM THE EXAMPLE OF MADAME DE MORCERF AND HER SON WHAT EXAMPLE THEY GAVE ALL THEIR FORTUNE TO THE HOSPITALS WHAT FORTUNE THEIR OWN
YOU THEREFORE STILL OWE ME FIVE MILLIONS AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS I WILL TAKE THE FIVE SCRAPS OF PAPER THAT I NOW HOLD AS BONDS WITH YOUR SIGNATURE ALONE AND HERE IS A RECEIPT IN FULL FOR THE SIX MILLIONS BETWEEN US
BURNED SEVERAL PAPERS LEFT OTHERS EXPOSED TO VIEW
AND SAYING SOMETHING TO HIS COMPANION WITH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST PROBABLY THOUGHT AMORY WHAT HE SAID WAS MY GOD AREN'T PEOPLE HORRIBLE NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD AMORY CONSIDERED POOR PEOPLE
OH WORK WORK MY PASSION MY JOY MY DELIGHT IT IS FOR THEE TO ALLEVIATE MY SORROWS
THAT IS BEING WRESTED FROM ITS GRASP SUDDENLY HE RALLIED MADE A VIOLENT EFFORT TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF AND THEN A SMILE GRADUALLY WIDENED THE FEATURES OF HIS DISTURBED COUNTENANCE CERTAINLY HE SAID YOUR RECEIPT IS MONEY
NO DECIDEDLY NO KEEP MY SIGNATURES BUT YOU KNOW NONE ARE SO FORMAL AS BANKERS IN TRANSACTING BUSINESS I INTENDED THIS MONEY FOR THE CHARITY FUND AND I SEEMED TO BE ROBBING THEM IF I DID NOT PAY THEM WITH THESE PRECISE BONDS HOW ABSURD
HOW THE SMELL OF IT HAD SUDDENLY CLEARED THE AIR AND GIVEN EVERY ONE IN THE CAR A MOMENTARY GLOW I DETEST POOR PEOPLE THOUGHT AMORY SUDDENLY I HATE THEM FOR BEING POOR POVERTY MAY HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL ONCE BUT IT'S ROTTEN NOW
THAT DEPRESSED HIM WITH ITS HEAVY ODOR COMPOUNDED OF THE TOBACCO SMELL OF THE MEN AND THE FETID SENSUOUSNESS OF STALE POWDER ON WOMEN AFTER THE THICK CROWD CAME ANOTHER SCATTERING A STRAY HALF DOZEN A MAN ON CRUTCHES
HE SLEEPS INDEED AND THIS IS THE MORE STRANGE SINCE THE LEAST CONTRADICTION KEEPS HIM AWAKE ALL NIGHT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO NOR HAVE I MUCH CURIOSITY TO MORROW I'M GOING TO LEAVE NEW YORK FOR GOOD IT'S A BAD TOWN UNLESS YOU'RE ON TOP OF IT QUESTION DO YOU WANT A LOT OF MONEY A
THEY'RE WARMING THEMSELVES AT HER VIRTUE BUT SARAH SEES THE SIMPER AND NEVER MAKES THAT REMARK AGAIN ONLY SHE FEELS A LITTLE COLDER AFTER THAT QUESTION ALL YOUR CALORIES GONE
THE SILENCE OF THE THEATRE BEHIND HIM ENDED WITH A CURIOUS SNAPPING SOUND FOLLOWED BY THE HEAVY ROARING OF A RISING CROWD AND THE INTERLACED CLATTER OF MANY VOICES THE MATINEE WAS OVER
WHILE THE PERSPIRATION STARTED FROM THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR YES KEEP IT KEEP IT MONTE CRISTO REPLACED THE NOTES IN HIS POCKET WITH THAT INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED TO SAY COME REFLECT IF YOU REPENT THERE IS STILL TIME
THEY ARE GONE TO SEEK A VERY STRICT CONVENT IN ITALY OR SPAIN
IT IS ONE OF THE BEST HOUSES IN EUROPE SAID DANGLARS CARELESSLY THROWING DOWN THE RECEIPT ON HIS DESK AND HE HAD FIVE MILLIONS IN YOUR HANDS ALONE WHY THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO MUST BE A NABOB INDEED I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS
I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO
I THINK I ARRIVED JUST IN TIME TO OBTAIN YOUR SIGNATURES OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DISPUTED WITH ME
THAT MONEY MITIGATES MANY TRIALS AND IF YOU ADMIT THE EFFICACY OF THIS SOVEREIGN BALM YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY EASILY CONSOLED YOU THE KING OF FINANCE THE FOCUS OF IMMEASURABLE POWER
IT IS INDEED SAID DANGLARS IT IS A FINE THING TO HAVE SUCH CREDIT REALLY IT IS ONLY IN FRANCE THESE THINGS ARE DONE FIVE MILLIONS ON FIVE LITTLE SCRAPS OF PAPER IT MUST BE SEEN TO BE BELIEVED
FOR INDEED MISFORTUNE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF MY HOUSE WHEN I PERCEIVED YOU I WAS JUST ASKING MYSELF WHETHER I HAD NOT WISHED HARM TOWARDS THOSE POOR MORCERFS WHICH WOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED THE PROVERB OF
I THINK SO I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL AT ALL ANY MORE QUESTION IS THAT A BAD SIGN IN ITSELF

AFTER EXPRESSING ACUTE SYMPATHY WITH THE FATHER
ACCOMPANIED BY ALL THE LEADING MEN OF THE DAY AT THE BAR IN LITERATURE OR THE ARMY
IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED BUT THE ARTICLE IS NOT MINE
THEY DON'T THEY JUST WANT THE FUN OF EATING IT ALL OVER AGAIN THE MATRON DOESN'T WANT TO REPEAT HER GIRLHOOD SHE WANTS TO REPEAT HER HONEYMOON
FOOL THEN ENCLOSING MONTE CRISTO'S RECEIPT IN A LITTLE POCKET BOOK HE ADDED YES COME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK I SHALL THEN BE FAR AWAY THEN HE DOUBLE LOCKED HIS DOOR EMPTIED ALL HIS DRAWERS COLLECTED ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN BANK NOTES
EVERYTHING AND INDEED NO SOONER HAD THE DOCTOR LEFT THE ROOM THAN HE WAS AGAIN ABSORBED IN STUDY
FAMILY GRIEFS OR INDEED ANY OTHER AFFLICTION WHICH WOULD CRUSH A MAN WHOSE CHILD WAS HIS ONLY TREASURE ARE ENDURABLE TO A MILLIONAIRE PHILOSOPHERS MAY WELL SAY AND PRACTICAL MEN WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT THE OPINION
FIVE MILLIONS HERE IS HIS RECEIPT BELIEVE YOUR OWN EYES
AND SOME OF OUR OLD FRIENDS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE WE MEAN DEBRAY
EQUALLY PLEASED TO WITNESS THE FESTIVITIES OR THE MOURNING OF THE RICH AND WHO RUSH WITH THE SAME AVIDITY TO A FUNERAL PROCESSION AS TO THE MARRIAGE OF A DUCHESS GRADUALLY THE RECEPTION ROOM FILLED
HE WHO WISHES MISFORTUNES TO HAPPEN TO OTHERS EXPERIENCES THEM HIMSELF WELL ON MY WORD OF HONOR I ANSWERED NO I WISHED NO ILL TO MORCERF HE WAS A LITTLE PROUD PERHAPS FOR A MAN WHO LIKE MYSELF HAS RISEN FROM NOTHING
BECOMING REALLY INSINCERE CALLING MYSELF NOT SUCH A BAD FELLOW THINKING I REGRETTED MY LOST YOUTH WHEN I ONLY ENVY THE DELIGHTS OF LOSING IT
SHALL YOU BE PRESENT IN THE RECEPTION ROOM NO I HAVE A COUSIN WHO HAS UNDERTAKEN THIS SAD OFFICE I SHALL WORK DOCTOR

CERTAINLY IT WILL ONLY COST YOU A DISCOUNT OF FIVE THOUSAND OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS THE RECEIVER STARTED BACK MA FOI HE SAID I PREFER WAITING TILL TO MORROW WHAT A PROPOSITION
CAME A FURTHER SCATTERING OF PEOPLE WHOSE EYES AS THEY EMERGED GLANCED INVARIABLY FIRST AT THE WET STREET THEN AT THE RAIN FILLED AIR FINALLY AT THE DISMAL SKY LAST A DENSE STROLLING MASS
AND ALWAYS THERE WAS THE ECONOMICAL STUFFINESS OF INDOOR WINTER AND THE LONG SUMMERS NIGHTMARES OF PERSPIRATION BETWEEN STICKY ENVELOPING WALLS DIRTY RESTAURANTS WHERE CARELESS TIRED PEOPLE HELPED THEMSELVES TO SUGAR WITH THEIR OWN USED COFFEE SPOONS
LEAVING HARD BROWN DEPOSITS IN THE BOWL IT WAS NOT SO BAD WHERE THERE WERE ONLY MEN OR ELSE ONLY WOMEN IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE VILELY HERDED THAT IT ALL SEEMED SO ROTTEN IT WAS SOME SHAME THAT WOMEN GAVE OFF AT HAVING MEN SEE THEM TIRED AND POOR
NO SAID VILLEFORT ONLY RETURN AGAIN AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT TWELVE THE THE OH HEAVENS MY POOR POOR CHILD AND THE PROCUREUR AGAIN BECOMING A MAN LIFTED UP HIS EYES AND GROANED
WE NEED NOT SAY THAT A SMILE OF CONDESCENSION WAS STAMPED UPON HIS LIPS GOOD MORNING CREDITOR SAID HE FOR I WAGER ANYTHING IT IS THE CREDITOR WHO VISITS ME
IT WAS SOME DISGUST THAT MEN HAD FOR WOMEN WHO WERE TIRED AND POOR IT WAS DIRTIER THAN ANY BATTLE FIELD HE HAD SEEN
A FATHOM DEEP IN SLEEP I LIE WITH OLD DESIRES RESTRAINED BEFORE TO CLAMOR LIFEWARD WITH A CRY AS DARK FLIES OUT THE GREYING DOOR AND SO IN QUEST OF CREEDS TO SHARE I SEEK ASSERTIVE DAY AGAIN
OR NEAPOLITAN BONDS SAID MONTE CRISTO NO SAID DANGLARS SMILING
TAKE IT TO ROTHSCHILD'S OR LAFITTE'S AND THEY WILL TAKE IT OFF YOUR HANDS AT ONCE
EUGENIE HAS LEFT US GOOD HEAVENS WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME THE TRUTH MY DEAR COUNT OH HOW HAPPY YOU MUST BE IN NOT HAVING EITHER WIFE OR CHILDREN DO YOU THINK SO INDEED I DO
THERE IS STILL A SUM OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OH A MERE NOTHING SAID MONTE CRISTO THE BALANCE WOULD COME TO ABOUT THAT SUM BUT KEEP IT AND WE SHALL BE QUITS COUNT SAID DANGLARS ARE YOU SPEAKING SERIOUSLY
HOW SO THE COUNT HAS AN UNLIMITED CREDIT UPON ME A CREDIT OPENED BY THOMSON AND FRENCH OF ROME HE CAME TO DEMAND FIVE MILLIONS AT ONCE WHICH I PAID HIM WITH CHECKS ON THE BANK MY FUNDS ARE DEPOSITED THERE AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
A GREAT SWARM OF TIRED MAGPIE GIRLS FROM A DEPARTMENT STORE CROWDED ALONG WITH SHRIEKS OF STRIDENT LAUGHTER THREE TO AN UMBRELLA A SQUAD OF MARCHING POLICEMEN PASSED ALREADY MIRACULOUSLY PROTECTED BY OILSKIN CAPES THE RAIN GAVE AMORY A FEELING OF DETACHMENT
STILL HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HERE SAID DEBRAY I WONDER WHAT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT TO NIGHT THIS FUNERAL IS THE NEWS OF THE DAY BUT HUSH HERE COMES OUR MINISTER OF JUSTICE
YOU DID SEE HIM I THINK YES WELL
THAT IF I DRAW OUT TEN MILLIONS ON THE SAME DAY IT WILL APPEAR RATHER STRANGE TO THE GOVERNOR TWO DAYS WILL BE A DIFFERENT THING SAID DANGLARS SMILING COME SAID BOVILLE WITH A TONE OF ENTIRE INCREDULITY FIVE MILLIONS TO THAT GENTLEMAN WHO JUST LEFT
THAT'S WHY A GOOD MAN GOING WRONG ATTRACTS PEOPLE THEY STAND AROUND AND LITERALLY WARM THEMSELVES AT THE CALORIES OF VIRTUE HE GIVES OFF SARAH MAKES AN UNSOPHISTICATED REMARK AND THE FACES SIMPER IN DELIGHT HOW INNOCENT THE POOR CHILD IS
AS THOUGH TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER HE SPOKE SERIOUSLY YES HE ANSWERED IF A FORTUNE BRINGS CONSOLATION I OUGHT TO BE CONSOLED I AM RICH
AS IF ONE CROWN WERE NOT AS GOOD AS ANOTHER EXCUSE ME AND HE BEGAN TO LAUGH LOUDLY BUT NERVOUSLY CERTAINLY I EXCUSE YOU SAID MONTE CRISTO GRACIOUSLY AND POCKET THEM AND HE PLACED THE BONDS IN HIS POCKET BOOK BUT
GRIEF DOES NOT STUN ME I HAVE NOT BEEN IN BED FOR TWO NIGHTS BUT THEN LOOK AT MY DESK SEE WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN DURING THESE TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS I HAVE FILLED THOSE PAPERS AND HAVE MADE OUT THE ACCUSATION AGAINST THE ASSASSIN BENEDETTO
OWN TASTE THE BEST ISABELLE CLARA ROSALIND ELEANOR WERE ALL AMERICAN ELEANOR WOULD PITCH PROBABLY SOUTHPAW ROSALIND WAS OUTFIELD WONDERFUL HITTER CLARA FIRST BASE MAYBE
STAY COUNT HE ADDED YOU WHO MAY BE CALLED THE EMPEROR IF I CLAIM THE TITLE OF KING OF FINANCE HAVE YOU MANY PIECES OF PAPER OF THIS SIZE EACH WORTH A MILLION
SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE INSULT OFFERED TO US BY THAT WRETCH SO SHE ASKED PERMISSION TO TRAVEL AND IS SHE GONE THE OTHER NIGHT SHE LEFT
THAT YOU HAD A DEFICIENCY TO MAKE UP INDEED SAID THE RECEIVER AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE IT WOULD BE WORTH WHILE TO MAKE SOME SACRIFICE THANK YOU NO SIR THEN IT WILL BE TO MORROW YES BUT WITHOUT FAIL
RATHER I DON'T WANT TO COMMIT MORAL SUICIDE QUESTION HAVE YOU NO INTERESTS LEFT
AND THEY BOTH RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY TO THE PROCUREUR'S STUDY
ARE YOU THEN PRESSED FOR THIS MONEY YES FOR THE EXAMINATION OF OUR CASH TAKES PLACE TO MORROW TO MORROW WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME SO BEFORE WHY IT IS AS GOOD AS A CENTURY AT WHAT HOUR DOES THE EXAMINATION TAKE PLACE AT TWO O'CLOCK
AND DANGER IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREIN BIRTH AND MARRIAGE AND DEATH WERE LOATHSOME SECRET THINGS HE REMEMBERED ONE DAY IN THE SUBWAY WHEN A DELIVERY BOY HAD BROUGHT IN A GREAT FUNERAL WREATH OF FRESH FLOWERS
THIS DIALOGUE MERGED GROTESQUELY INTO HIS MIND'S MOST FAMILIAR STATE A GROTESQUE BLENDING OF DESIRES WORRIES EXTERIOR IMPRESSIONS AND PHYSICAL REACTIONS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVENTH STREET OR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVENTH STREET
REALLY THEY ARE THE ONLY THINGS I CAN DO QUESTION BE DEFINITE
ONE OF THEM WAS MADE OF DEBRAY CHATEAU RENAUD AND BEAUCHAMP POOR GIRL SAID DEBRAY LIKE THE REST PAYING AN INVOLUNTARY TRIBUTE TO THE SAD EVENT POOR GIRL
JUST PASSIVELY AFRAID QUESTION
AND ADVANCED TO MEET HIM WITH A SAD THOUGH AFFABLE SMILE WELL SAID HE EXTENDING HIS HAND TO MONTE CRISTO
TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK PLEASE PAY TO MY ORDER FROM THE FUND DEPOSITED BY ME THE SUM OF A MILLION AND CHARGE THE SAME TO MY ACCOUNT BARON DANGLARS
THE GENTLEMAN WHO RECEIVES US IS HE A DEPUTY OH NO I AM CONDEMNED TO WITNESS THOSE GENTLEMEN EVERY DAY SAID BEAUCHAMP BUT HE IS PERFECTLY UNKNOWN TO ME HAVE YOU MENTIONED THIS DEATH IN YOUR PAPER
THE CHARITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES TO YOU THROUGH ME THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS DEPUTE ME TO RECEIVE ALMS TO THE AMOUNT OF FIVE MILLIONS FROM YOU
NONE I'VE NO MORE VIRTUE TO LOSE JUST AS A COOLING POT GIVES OFF HEAT SO ALL THROUGH YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE WE GIVE OFF CALORIES OF VIRTUE THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED INGENUOUSNESS QUESTION AN INTERESTING IDEA
NOW I THINK OF IT YOU CAN DO BETTER SAID DANGLARS HOW DO YOU MEAN
THAT I HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS TO MY NAME QUESTION
OH DEAR YES AND IF YOU WERE AT ROME THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH WOULD MAKE NO MORE DIFFICULTY ABOUT PAYING THE MONEY ON MY RECEIPT THAN YOU HAVE JUST DONE PARDON ME COUNT PARDON ME THEN I MAY KEEP THIS MONEY YES SAID DANGLARS
DON'T ASK ME QUESTION DON'T YOU CARE
FROM TWELVE TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS BUT TO RETURN TO OUR MILLIONS
DANGLARS SIGNATURE THE NEXT MORNING DAWNED DULL AND CLOUDY DURING THE NIGHT THE UNDERTAKERS HAD EXECUTED THEIR MELANCHOLY OFFICE AND WRAPPED THE CORPSE IN THE WINDING SHEET
HE STOOD ASIDE EDGED A LITTLE INTO THE RAIN TO LET THE THRONG PASS A SMALL BOY RUSHED OUT SNIFFED IN THE DAMP FRESH AIR AND TURNED UP THE COLLAR OF HIS COAT CAME THREE OR FOUR COUPLES IN A GREAT HURRY
AND THEN MYSELF COVERED WITH RIDICULE THROUGH THE VILLANY OF BENEDETTO BESIDES BESIDES WHAT ASKED THE COUNT ALAS DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT NEW CALAMITY MY DAUGHTER
AND WHO BOWED TO ME AS THOUGH HE KNEW ME
UNCLE HAD ONLY PAID HUNDRED A MONTH FOR WHOLE GREAT BIG HOUSE IN MINNEAPOLIS QUESTION WERE THE STAIRS ON THE LEFT OR RIGHT AS YOU CAME IN ANYWAY IN TWELVE UNIVEE THEY WERE STRAIGHT BACK AND TO THE LEFT WHAT A DIRTY RIVER
AT BEST JUST PEOPLE TOO HOT OR TOO COLD TIRED WORRIED HE PICTURED THE ROOMS WHERE THESE PEOPLE LIVED WHERE THE PATTERNS OF THE BLISTERED WALL PAPERS WERE HEAVY REITERATED SUNFLOWERS ON GREEN AND YELLOW BACKGROUNDS
IF A THUNDERBOLT HAD FALLEN AT THE BANKER'S FEET
FOR EXAMPLE LOOK AT THE PURITANICAL PROCUREUR WHO HAS JUST LOST HIS DAUGHTER AND IN FACT NEARLY ALL HIS FAMILY IN SO SINGULAR A MANNER MORCERF DISHONORED AND DEAD
WONDER WHAT HUMBIRD'S BODY LOOKED LIKE NOW IF HE HIMSELF HADN'T BEEN BAYONET INSTRUCTOR HE'D HAVE GONE UP TO LINE THREE MONTHS SOONER PROBABLY BEEN KILLED WHERE'S THE DARNED BELL
I NEVER JOKE WITH BANKERS SAID MONTE CRISTO IN A FREEZING MANNER WHICH REPELLED IMPERTINENCE
PAY ME IN A DIFFERENT FORM I WISHED FROM CURIOSITY TO TAKE THESE THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT WITHOUT ANY ADVICE OR PREPARATION THE HOUSE OF DANGLARS HAD PAID ME FIVE MILLIONS WITHOUT A MINUTE'S DELAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE BUT HERE ARE YOUR BONDS PAY ME DIFFERENTLY
BUT DID YOU RECEIVE MY LETTER YESTERDAY YES I HAVE BROUGHT MY RECEIPT
FOR WHAT REASON BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT SPEND MONEY SO GUILTILY ACQUIRED
BUT WHOM ARE YOU SEEKING DEBRAY I AM SEEKING THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO SAID THE YOUNG MAN
NO SAID MONTE CRISTO FOLDING THE FIVE NOTES MOST DECIDEDLY NOT THE THING IS SO CURIOUS I WILL MAKE THE EXPERIMENT MYSELF I AM CREDITED ON YOU FOR SIX MILLIONS I HAVE DRAWN NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
NOT NECESSARILY QUESTION WHAT WOULD BE THE TEST OF CORRUPTION
A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT IN OUR STORY AS IN THE WORLD HE OCCUPIED ONE OF THOSE BEINGS DESIGNED FROM THEIR BIRTH TO MAKE THEMSELVES USEFUL TO OTHERS HE WAS PUNCTUAL DRESSED IN BLACK WITH CRAPE AROUND HIS HAT
AT THE DOOR HE FOUND HIS CARRIAGE AND WAS IMMEDIATELY DRIVEN TO THE BANK
AND MONTE CRISTO PLACED THE BONDS IN HIS POCKET WITH ONE HAND
SOMEWHERE IN HIS MIND A CONVERSATION BEGAN RATHER RESUMED ITS PLACE IN HIS ATTENTION IT WAS COMPOSED NOT OF TWO VOICES BUT OF ONE WHICH ACTED ALIKE AS QUESTIONER AND ANSWERER QUESTION WELL WHAT'S THE SITUATION ANSWER
WHO WAS STANDING IN THE WAITING ROOM AND WHO WAS INTRODUCED INTO DANGLARS ROOM AS SOON AS THE COUNT HAD LEFT THE COUNT'S SAD FACE WAS ILLUMINED BY A FAINT SMILE AS HE NOTICED THE PORTFOLIO WHICH THE RECEIVER GENERAL HELD IN HIS HAND
AND WHO DID NOT EXACT A MOURNFUL FACE OR FORCE TEARS AS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE WITH A FATHER A BROTHER OR A LOVER
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE DURING WHICH THE NOISE OF THE BANKER'S PEN WAS ALONE HEARD WHILE MONTE CRISTO EXAMINED THE GILT MOULDINGS ON THE CEILING ARE THEY SPANISH HAITIAN
ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SAID MONTE CRISTO FIVE MILLIONS WHY WHAT A CROESUS YOU ARE THIS IS HOW I TRANSACT BUSINESS SAID DANGLARS IT IS REALLY WONDERFUL SAID THE COUNT ABOVE ALL
THE AIR BECAME GRAY AND OPALESCENT A SOLITARY LIGHT SUDDENLY OUTLINED A WINDOW OVER THE WAY THEN ANOTHER LIGHT THEN A HUNDRED MORE DANCED AND GLIMMERED INTO VISION UNDER HIS FEET A THICK IRON STUDDED SKYLIGHT TURNED YELLOW
LESS OWING TO HIS SOCIAL POSITION THAN TO HIS PERSONAL MERIT THE COUSIN STANDING AT THE DOOR USHERED IN THE GUESTS AND IT WAS RATHER A RELIEF TO THE INDIFFERENT TO SEE A PERSON AS UNMOVED AS THEMSELVES
NO I AM MERELY AFRAID OF BEING POOR QUESTION VERY AFRAID
THE QUERULOUS WORRY AS TO WHETHER SOME ONE ISN'T LEANING ON YOU A MAN DECIDING NOT TO GIVE HIS SEAT TO A WOMAN HATING HER FOR IT THE WOMAN HATING HIM FOR NOT DOING IT AT WORST A SQUALID PHANTASMAGORIA OF BREATH
HE HAS THREE UNLIMITED CREDITS ONE ON ME ONE ON ROTHSCHILD ONE ON LAFITTE AND YOU SEE HE ADDED CARELESSLY HE HAS GIVEN ME THE PREFERENCE BY LEAVING A BALANCE OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
WHAT HE STAMMERED DO YOU MEAN TO KEEP THAT MONEY EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME BUT I OWE THIS MONEY TO THE CHARITY FUND A DEPOSIT WHICH I PROMISED TO PAY THIS MORNING OH WELL THEN SAID MONTE CRISTO
SAYNE WHAT THE DEVIL NECK HURTS DARNED UNCOMFORTABLE SEAT NO DESIRE TO SLEEP WITH JILL WHAT COULD ALEC SEE IN HER
AND PRESENTED HIMSELF AT HIS COUSIN'S WITH A FACE MADE UP FOR THE OCCASION AND WHICH HE COULD ALTER AS MIGHT BE REQUIRED AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE MOURNING COACHES ROLLED INTO THE PAVED COURT
HE WOULD HAVE INTERESTED HIMSELF SOMEWHAT MORE ABOUT IT STILL SAID CHATEAU RENAUD
BUT WE ALL HAVE OUR FAULTS DO YOU KNOW COUNT THAT PERSONS OF OUR TIME OF LIFE NOT THAT YOU BELONG TO THE CLASS YOU ARE STILL A YOUNG MAN BUT AS I WAS SAYING PERSONS OF OUR TIME OF LIFE HAVE BEEN VERY UNFORTUNATE THIS YEAR
IF IT WASN'T APPENDICITIS INFLUENZA MAYBE WHAT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTIETH STREET
NO WITH A RELATION BUT STILL WE HAVE QUITE LOST OUR DEAR EUGENIE FOR I DOUBT WHETHER HER PRIDE WILL EVER ALLOW HER TO RETURN TO FRANCE STILL BARON SAID MONTE CRISTO
HE THOUGHT CYNICALLY HOW COMPLETELY HE WAS LACKING IN ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY O HENRY HAD FOUND IN THESE PEOPLE ROMANCE PATHOS LOVE HATE AMORY SAW ONLY COARSENESS PHYSICAL FILTH AND STUPIDITY HE MADE NO SELF ACCUSATIONS
NO SAID THE BANKER I HAVE APPEARED RATHER RIDICULOUS SINCE THAT AFFAIR OF BENEDETTO SO I REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND BAH YOU ARE WRONG HOW WERE YOU TO BLAME IN THAT AFFAIR
FINALLY THE RATTLING BANG OF FOLDING SEATS INSIDE ANNOUNCED THAT THE USHERS WERE AT WORK NEW YORK SEEMED NOT SO MUCH AWAKENING AS TURNING OVER IN ITS BED PALLID MEN RUSHED BY PINCHING TOGETHER THEIR COAT COLLARS
WHICH WHATEVER MAY BE SAID ABOUT THE EQUALITY OF DEATH IS AT LEAST A LAST PROOF OF THE LUXURY SO PLEASING IN LIFE THIS WINDING SHEET WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF CAMBRIC
SO YOUNG SO RICH SO BEAUTIFUL COULD YOU HAVE IMAGINED THIS SCENE CHATEAU RENAUD WHEN WE SAW HER AT THE MOST THREE WEEKS AGO ABOUT TO SIGN THAT CONTRACT INDEED NO SAID CHATEAU RENAUD DID YOU KNOW HER
THAT REMINDS ME HE SAID THAT WHEN YOU ENTERED I WAS ON THE POINT OF SIGNING FIVE LITTLE BONDS I HAVE ALREADY SIGNED TWO WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO DO THE SAME TO THE OTHERS PRAY DO SO
I MUST VISIT HIM HE SAID AND OBTAIN SOME PIOUS GRANT FROM HIM OH YOU MAY MAKE SURE OF HIM HIS CHARITIES ALONE AMOUNT TO TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH IT IS MAGNIFICENT
IF YOU WISHED TO DEMOLISH THEM YOU COULD NOT AND IF IT WERE POSSIBLE YOU WOULD NOT DARE
BUT OLD MONOTONY IS THERE ENDLESS AVENUES OF RAIN OH MIGHT I RISE AGAIN MIGHT I THROW OFF THE HEAT OF THAT OLD WINE SEE THE NEW MORNING MASS THE SKY WITH FAIRY TOWERS LINE ON LINE
MORE DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE MIGHT SOME DAY EVEN BE HIS PROBLEM AT PRESENT IT ROUSED ONLY HIS PROFOUND DISTASTE HE WALKED OVER TO FIFTH AVENUE DODGING THE BLIND BLACK MENACE OF UMBRELLAS AND STANDING IN FRONT OF DELMONICO'S HAILED AN AUTO BUS
ONE O TWO INSTEAD OF ONE TWO SEVEN ROSALIND NOT LIKE BEATRICE ELEANOR LIKE BEATRICE ONLY WILDER AND BRAINIER APARTMENTS ALONG HERE EXPENSIVE PROBABLY HUNDRED AND FIFTY A MONTH MAYBE TWO HUNDRED
WITH AN ENERGY OF ACTION THOSE CAN ALONE UNDERSTAND
LISTEN WHEN ONE BEARS AN IRREPROACHABLE NAME AS I DO ONE IS RATHER SENSITIVE
AND THE NUMEROUS UNPLEASANT ASPECTS OF CITY LIFE WITHOUT MONEY OCCURRED TO HIM IN THREATENING PROCESSION THERE WAS THE GHASTLY STINKING CRUSH OF THE SUBWAY THE CAR CARDS THRUSTING THEMSELVES AT ONE LEERING OUT LIKE DULL BORES WHO GRAB YOUR ARM WITH ANOTHER STORY
WANT TO GO DOWN THERE AND SEE IF IT'S DIRTY FRENCH RIVERS ALL BROWN OR BLACK SO WERE SOUTHERN RIVERS TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS MEANT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOUGHNUTS HE COULD LIVE ON IT THREE MONTHS AND SLEEP IN THE PARK WONDER WHERE JILL WAS JILL BAYNE FAYNE
HIS BANKER DANGLARS IS HIS BANKER IS HE NOT ASKED CHATEAU RENAUD OF DEBRAY I BELIEVE SO REPLIED THE SECRETARY WITH SLIGHT UNEASINESS BUT MONTE CRISTO IS NOT THE ONLY ONE I MISS HERE I DO NOT SEE MORREL
MADE PROFOUND REFLECTIONS ON THE OLD MAN'S CONVERSATION THIS HONEST TURK SAID HE TO PANGLOSS AND MARTIN SEEMS TO BE IN A SITUATION FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT OF THE SIX KINGS WITH WHOM WE HAD THE HONOUR OF SUPPING
AND SHE BEGAN AT ONCE TO FEED HIM WITH BITS OF BISCUIT AND SIPS OF WINE AS SHE FED HIM HE CONTRIVED TO KISS THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS NOW AND THEN SHE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THE PRINCE FELT BETTER
KING NADAB THE SON OF JEROBOAM WAS KILLED BY BAASA
HE RESOLVED TO ABIDE HIS FATE AND TURNING TO THE PEOPLE SAID NOW YOU CAN GO THE KING HAD ALREADY GONE HOME TO DINNER NOW YOU CAN GO REPEATED THE PRINCESS AFTER HIM LIKE A PARROT
BUT SHE BECAME AN EXCELLENT PASTRY COOK
WHETHER THE PRINCE WAS SO NEAR PERFECTION THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO DEMAND PERFECTION ITSELF I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE WAS A FINE HANDSOME
VERY WELL SAID THE PRINCE AND CATCHING HER UP IN HIS ARMS HE SPRANG WITH HER FROM THE ROCK THE PRINCESS HAD JUST TIME TO GIVE ONE DELIGHTED SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER BEFORE THE WATER CLOSED OVER THEM
SO HE GAVE HER A STRONG LIFT OUT OF THE WATER TO LAY HER ON THE BANK BUT HER GRAVITATION CEASING THE MOMENT SHE LEFT THE WATER AWAY SHE WENT UP INTO THE AIR SCOLDING AND SCREAMING
AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
HIS WIFE BECAME UGLIER EVERY DAY MORE PEEVISH AND UNSUPPORTABLE THE OLD WOMAN WAS INFIRM AND EVEN MORE FRETFUL THAN CUNEGONDE CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE
OR IN SHORT THE POWER OF MAKING IMPRESSIONS UPON THE RADICAL SENSORIUM SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER SHE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE OF COURSE HE MADE NO FURTHER INQUIRIES ABOUT HER
AT LEAST I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHERE IT IS I WISH I HADN'T ONE EITHER REJOINED THE PRINCESS IT IS SO STUPID I HAVE A GREAT MIND SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY THEM ALL A TRICK WHY COULDN'T THEY LEAVE ME ALONE
AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER PRINCESS SAID HE BUT AT THE MOMENT UP STARTED THE PRINCESS CRYING I'M AFLOAT I'M AFLOAT AND THE LITTLE BOAT BUMPED AGAINST THE STONE PRINCESS
CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT
THOUGHT THE PRINCE BUT YOU ARE WORTH DYING FOR AFTER ALL AGAIN A WAVELET AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED BOTH THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK OR MOVE
IT IS NATURAL TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS CANDIDE MARRIED AND LIVING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER PANGLOSS THE PHILOSOPHER MARTIN THE PRUDENT CACAMBO AND THE OLD WOMAN
I PITY YOU THE PRINCE NOW SAW THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE BEWITCHED PRINCESS AND HAD ALREADY OFFENDED HER BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT SHE BURST OUT ANGRILY GIVING A STAMP WITH HER FOOT
UNTIL REACHING THE GROUND AND SEEING HIM STANDING THERE SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM AND SAID I'LL TELL PAPA OH NO YOU WON'T RETURNED THE PRINCE YES I WILL SHE PERSISTED
AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
HE TURNED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS AND SAID HOW AM I TO PUT YOU IN THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS SHE ANSWERED QUITE SNAPPISHLY
WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO PULL ME DOWN OUT OF THE WATER AND THROW ME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR I NEVER DID YOU ANY HARM PARDON ME I DID NOT MEAN TO HURT YOU I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY BRAINS AND THAT IS A WORSE LOSS THAN YOUR WRETCHED GRAVITY
REPLIED THE PRINCESS I THINK I WILL GO TO SLEEP AGAIN JUST GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE AND A BISCUIT FIRST SAID THE PRINCE VERY HUMBLY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE PRINCESS AND GAPED AS SHE SAID IT
FOR HE MADE A GOOD JOINER AND BECAME A VERY HONEST MAN
THE COURTIERS DID NOT RESENT HIS BLUNTNESS EXCEPT BY SAYING TO EACH OTHER THAT HE WAS TAKING IT OUT IN IMPUDENCE BUT HOW WAS HE TO BE PUT IN THE GOLDEN PLATE CONTAINED NO INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT
THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU THE PRINCE WENT TO DRESS FOR THE OCCASION FOR HE WAS RESOLVED TO DIE LIKE A PRINCE WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THAT A MAN HAD OFFERED TO DIE FOR HER
BRAVE GENEROUS WELL BRED AND WELL BEHAVED YOUTH AS ALL PRINCES ARE IN HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD COME ACROSS SOME REPORTS ABOUT OUR PRINCESS
IT TOUCHED HIS CHIN IT TOUCHED HIS LOWER LIP IT TOUCHED BETWEEN HIS LIPS HE SHUT THEM HARD TO KEEP IT OUT THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO FEEL STRANGE IT TOUCHED HIS UPPER LIP
AND WHERE EVEN IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT HE WOULD BE IN NO DANGER OF BEING DISCOVERED FROM THE OPPOSITE SHORE IT WAS A SORT OF CAVE IN THE ROCK WHERE HE PROVIDED HIMSELF A BED OF WITHERED LEAVES AND LAY DOWN TOO TIRED FOR HUNGER TO KEEP HIM AWAKE
WITH KAIMAK ENRICHED WITH THE CANDIED PEEL OF CITRONS WITH ORANGES LEMONS PINE APPLES PISTACHIO NUTS AND MOCHA COFFEE UNADULTERATED WITH THE BAD COFFEE OF BATAVIA OR THE AMERICAN ISLANDS
HAVING BESIDES BROUGHT SO MANY DIAMONDS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ANCIENT INCAS MUST HAVE LED A VERY HAPPY LIFE BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IMPOSED UPON BY THE JEWS THAT HE HAD NOTHING LEFT EXCEPT HIS SMALL FARM
GRANDEUR SAID PANGLOSS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF PHILOSOPHERS FOR IN SHORT EGLON KING OF MOAB WAS ASSASSINATED BY EHUD ABSALOM WAS HUNG BY HIS HAIR AND PIERCED WITH THREE DARTS
SHE WAS SO TRANSPORTED THAT SHE JUMPED OFF THE BED FEEBLE AS SHE WAS AND DANCED ABOUT THE ROOM FOR JOY SHE DID NOT CARE WHO THE MAN WAS THAT WAS NOTHING TO HER THE HOLE WANTED STOPPING AND IF ONLY A MAN WOULD DO WHY TAKE ONE
DON'T YOU LIKE FALLING IN THEN SAID THE PRINCE IT IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL FUN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE ANSWERED SHE I NEVER FELL BEFORE I WISH I COULD LEARN
NOW I CANNOT TELL HOW IT CAME ABOUT WHETHER SHE PRETENDED TO BE DROWNING OR WHETHER HE FRIGHTENED HER OR CAUGHT HER SO AS TO EMBARRASS HER BUT CERTAINLY HE BROUGHT HER TO SHORE IN A FASHION IGNOMINIOUS TO A SWIMMER
AND THE PRINCESS SAT AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE FED HIM NOW AND THEN THE NIGHT WORE ON THE WATERS ROSE AND ROSE THE MOON ROSE LIKEWISE HIGHER AND HIGHER
AS SOON AS THEY DISAPPEARED HE LANDED IN SEARCH OF HIS TUNIC AND SWORD AND AFTER SOME TROUBLE FOUND THEM AGAIN THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY ROUND THE LAKE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE THE WOOD WAS WILDER
PANGLOSS OWNED THAT HE HAD ALWAYS SUFFERED HORRIBLY BUT AS HE HAD ONCE ASSERTED THAT EVERYTHING WENT WONDERFULLY WELL HE ASSERTED IT STILL THOUGH HE NO LONGER BELIEVED IT WHAT HELPED TO CONFIRM MARTIN IN HIS DETESTABLE PRINCIPLES
I CONTENT MYSELF WITH SENDING THERE FOR SALE THE FRUITS OF THE GARDEN WHICH I CULTIVATE HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE INVITED THE STRANGERS INTO HIS HOUSE HIS TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS PRESENTED THEM WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF SHERBET WHICH THEY MADE THEMSELVES
REPEATED THE PRINCE ENCOURAGED BY SEEING HER WIDE AWAKE AND LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE WATER WELL SAID SHE WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND
SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND LISTENED STRANGE SOUNDS CAME ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS IN FACT THE PRINCESS LAUGHING NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN HER LAUGH AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED
SO PERFECTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAD SHE BEEN IN THE WATER THAT EVEN YET THE PRINCE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW HER ASCEND SLOWLY GRASP THE BALCONY AND DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE WINDOW
MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE WITH WHAT MEDDLEST THOU SAID THE DERVISH IS IT THY BUSINESS
IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE APPEARED THE PRINCESS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM HERE I AM SAID THE PRINCE PUT ME IN
I SHALL NEVER SWIM MORE SAID THE PRINCE OH I FORGOT SAID THE PRINCESS AND WAS SILENT SO THE WATER GREW AND GREW AND ROSE UP AND UP ON THE PRINCE
AND MERELY WHISPERED AS HE GAVE HER THE PARTING LIFT DON'T TELL THE ONLY ANSWER THE PRINCESS RETURNED WAS A ROGUISH LOOK SHE WAS ALREADY A YARD ABOVE HIS HEAD THE LOOK SEEMED TO SAY NEVER FEAR IT IS TOO GOOD FUN TO SPOIL THAT WAY
I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER BUT I DON'T CARE AT ALL EVENTS AS WE HAVE FALLEN IN LET US HAVE A SWIM TOGETHER WITH ALL MY HEART RESPONDED THE PRINCE
FEELING VERY FAINT INDEED ONLY I SHALL DIE BEFORE IT IS OF ANY USE TO YOU UNLESS I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT THERE THEN SAID SHE HOLDING OUT THE WINE TO HIM AH YOU MUST FEED ME I DARE NOT MOVE MY HANDS
AND A LONG PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU PRINCE SAID THE PRINCESS AT LAST QUITE COOLLY AS SHE LAY IN THE BOAT WITH HER EYES SHUT I AM SORRY I CAN'T RETURN THE COMPLIMENT
AND THEY SAW OTHER CADIS PASHAS AND EFFENDIS COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
FOR HER ANGER MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN ANY ONE ELSE HAD EVER BEHELD HER AND AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT FAR SHE HAD NOT A SINGLE FAULT ABOUT HER EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT SHE HAD NOT ANY GRAVITY
HE NEVER DREAMED THAT SHE COULD BEWITCH HIM FOR WHAT INDEED COULD A PRINCE DO WITH A PRINCESS THAT HAD LOST HER GRAVITY WHO COULD TELL WHAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE NEXT SHE MIGHT LOSE HER VISIBILITY OR HER TANGIBILITY
AND ONE MUST ALLOW THAT SHE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO FEEL PROVOKED WITH THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE FARED NO BETTER BUT BOTH HE AND THE QUEEN WERE FAST ASLEEP AND THE CHAMBERLAIN WENT BACK TO HIS BED
THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THE HOLE AND SAW BUT ONE WAY HE PUT BOTH HIS LEGS INTO IT SITTING ON THE STONE AND STOOPING FORWARD COVERED THE CORNER THAT REMAINED OPEN WITH HIS TWO HANDS IN THIS UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION
AND SHONE FULL ON THE FACE OF THE DYING PRINCE THE WATER WAS UP TO HIS NECK WILL YOU KISS ME PRINCESS SAID HE FEEBLY THE NONCHALANCE WAS ALL GONE NOW
ATHALIAH BY JEHOIADA THE KINGS JEHOIAKIM JECONIAH AND ZEDEKIAH WERE LED INTO CAPTIVITY
TO THINK I AM THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FATHER'S KINGDOM THAT CAN'T FALL HERE THE POOR PRINCESS LOOKED ALMOST SAD I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO FALL IN WITH YOU ANY TIME YOU LIKE SAID THE PRINCE DEVOTEDLY THANK YOU
SOMEHOW THE DOCTORS NEVER CAME SO THE PRINCESS AND HER OLD NURSE WERE LEFT WITH THE PRINCE BUT THE OLD NURSE WAS A WISE WOMAN AND KNEW WHAT TO DO THEY TRIED EVERYTHING FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SUCCESS
THERE IS A CONCATENATION OF EVENTS IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
THAT WOULD HAVE SENT HER ALOFT AGAIN BUT FOR THE HOLD SHE HAD OF HIS ARM PUT ME UP DIRECTLY PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER ALMOST ALREADY
THE PRINCESS WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED BETWEEN HOPE AND FEAR BUT SHE TRIED ON AND ON ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND EVERYTHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT LAST WHEN THEY HAD ALL BUT GIVEN IT UP JUST AS THE SUN ROSE
THE PEOPLE OBEYED HER AND WENT PRESENTLY A LITTLE WAVE FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED ONE OF THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT MUCH
HE TURNED ALMOST EXPECTING TO SEE HER STILL BY HIS SIDE BUT HE WAS ALONE IN THE WATER SO HE SWAM AWAY QUIETLY AND WATCHED THE LIGHTS ROVING ABOUT THE SHORE FOR HOURS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS SAFE IN HER CHAMBER
IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN PUT INTO THE INQUISITION IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED OVER AMERICA IF YOU HAD NOT STABBED THE BARON IF YOU HAD NOT LOST ALL YOUR SHEEP FROM THE FINE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE EATING PRESERVED CITRONS AND PISTACHIO NUTS
THERE IS HORRIBLE EVIL IN THIS WORLD WHAT SIGNIFIES IT SAID THE DERVISH WHETHER THERE BE EVIL OR GOOD WHEN HIS HIGHNESS SENDS A SHIP TO EGYPT DOES HE TROUBLE HIS HEAD WHETHER THE MICE ON BOARD ARE AT THEIR EASE OR NOT
AS YOU DID A LITTLE WHILE AGO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH HOLD OF THE BALCONY AND GET IN AT THE WINDOW AND THEN THEY MAY LOOK FOR ME TILL TO MORROW MORNING WITH MORE OBEDIENCE THAN PLEASURE SAID THE PRINCE GALLANTLY AND AWAY THEY SWAM VERY GENTLY
TILL SHE GOT TO THE LANDING STAIRS OF THE PALACE BY THIS TIME HER PEOPLE WERE ON THE SHORE FOR THEY HAD HEARD HER SHRIEK SHE MADE THEM CARRY THE PRINCE TO HER OWN ROOM AND LAY HIM IN HER BED AND LIGHT A FIRE AND SEND FOR THE DOCTORS
BUT THE LAKE YOUR HIGHNESS SAID THE CHAMBERLAIN WHO ROUSED BY THE NOISE CAME IN IN HIS NIGHTCAP GO AND DROWN YOURSELF IN IT SHE SAID THIS WAS THE LAST RUDENESS OF WHICH THE PRINCESS WAS EVER GUILTY
NOW FOR YOUR OWN SAKE PRINCESS SAID HE I CANNOT LET YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU MUST SIT AND LOOK AT ME ELSE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WELL I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO OBLIGE YOU
LET US WORK SAID MARTIN WITHOUT DISPUTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO RENDER LIFE TOLERABLE THE WHOLE LITTLE SOCIETY ENTERED INTO THIS LAUDABLE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABILITIES THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRINCESSES WHO ARE FORCED TO MARRY BEFORE THEY HAVE HAD A BIT OF FUN I WISH OUR PRINCESSES GOT LOST IN A FOREST SOMETIMES ONE LOVELY EVENING AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR MANY DAYS
THE PRINCE MEANTIME STOOD IN THE WATER STARING AND FORGETTING TO GET OUT BUT THE PRINCESS DISAPPEARING HE SCRAMBLED ON SHORE AND WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TREE
AND THE BUBBLES OF HIS LAST BREATH BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER THE PRINCESS GAVE A SHRIEK AND SPRANG INTO THE LAKE SHE LAID HOLD FIRST OF ONE LEG AND THEN OF THE OTHER AND PULLED AND TUGGED BUT SHE COULD NOT MOVE EITHER SHE STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
AND AWAY THEY WENT SWIMMING AND DIVING AND FLOATING UNTIL AT LAST THEY HEARD CRIES ALONG THE SHORE AND SAW LIGHTS GLANCING IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS NOW QUITE LATE AND THERE WAS NO MOON I MUST GO HOME SAID THE PRINCESS
FOR THE HATCHING OF A REAL HEARTY LAUGH REQUIRES THE INCUBATION OF GRAVITY AND PERHAPS THIS WAS HOW THE PRINCE MISTOOK THE LAUGHTER FOR SCREAMING LOOKING OVER THE LAKE HE SAW SOMETHING WHITE IN THE WATER AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD TORN OFF HIS TUNIC
AND GUSH AFTER GUSH THE WATERS WERE RISING UP THE PRINCE'S BODY THEY WERE UP TO HIS WAIST NOW WHY CAN'T WE GO AND HAVE A SWIM SAID THE PRINCESS
THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
THEY WON'T TRUST ME IN THE LAKE FOR A SINGLE NIGHT YOU SEE WHERE THAT GREEN LIGHT IS BURNING THAT IS THE WINDOW OF MY ROOM NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST SWIM THERE WITH ME VERY QUIETLY AND WHEN WE ARE ALL BUT UNDER THE BALCONY
HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
YOU MUST HAVE A VAST AND MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID CANDIDE TO THE TURK I HAVE ONLY TWENTY ACRES REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AND MY CHILDREN CULTIVATE THEM OUR LABOUR PRESERVES US FROM THREE GREAT EVILS WEARINESS VICE AND WANT
NO PRINCE HOWEVER WOULD JUDGE OF A PRINCESS BY WEIGHT THE LOVELINESS OF HER FOOT HE WOULD HARDLY ESTIMATE BY THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION IT COULD MAKE IN MUD PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE IN THE WATER YOU STUPID
WILL YOU BE IN THE LAKE TO MORROW NIGHT THE PRINCE VENTURED TO ASK TO BE SURE I WILL I DON'T THINK SO PERHAPS WAS THE PRINCESS'S SOMEWHAT STRANGE ANSWER
IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO
HE FOUND THAT HE WAS APPROACHING THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST FOR THE TREES HAD GOT SO THIN THAT HE COULD SEE THE SUNSET THROUGH THEM AND HE SOON CAME UPON A KIND OF HEATH NEXT HE CAME UPON SIGNS OF HUMAN NEIGHBOURHOOD
AND MORE NEARLY DROWNED THAN SHE HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE FOR THE WATER HAD GOT INTO HER THROAT AS OFTEN AS SHE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE BORE HER THE BANK WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER
THAT YOUR PRESENTS WOULD SOON BE DISSIPATED AND ONLY MAKE THEM THE MORE MISERABLE YOU HAVE ROLLED IN MILLIONS OF MONEY YOU AND CACAMBO
ANSWERED THE PRINCESS COME THEN SAID THE PRINCE THE CONDITION OF HER DRESS INCREASING HER USUAL DIFFICULTY IN WALKING COMPELLED HER TO CLING TO HIM AND HE COULD HARDLY PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT IN A DELIGHTFUL DREAM
AND YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ME ONCE DID HE THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST BUT I AM SO SLEEPY SLEEP THEN DARLING AND DON'T MIND ME SAID THE POOR PRINCE
BUT AS SURE AS HE FOUND A PRINCESS HE FOUND SOME FAULT IN HER OF COURSE HE COULD NOT MARRY A MERE WOMAN HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL AND THERE WAS NO PRINCESS TO BE FOUND WORTHY OF HIM
AND NOW THIS NEW ADVENTURE SET THEM PHILOSOPHISING MORE THAN EVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
THAT WE MUST CULTIVATE OUR GARDEN YOU ARE RIGHT SAID PANGLOSS FOR WHEN MAN WAS FIRST PLACED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE WAS PUT THERE UT OPERARETUR EUM THAT HE MIGHT CULTIVATE IT WHICH SHOWS THAT MAN WAS NOT BORN TO BE IDLE
ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
ONE DAY HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS RETINUE IN A GREAT FOREST THESE FORESTS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DELIVERING PRINCES FROM THEIR COURTIERS LIKE A SIEVE THAT KEEPS BACK THE BRAN THEN THE PRINCES GET AWAY TO FOLLOW THEIR FORTUNES
IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE GOING UP REJOINED SHE MY FEELING WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF ELEVATION TOO THE PRINCE CONCEDED THE PRINCESS DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM FOR SHE RETORTED HIS QUESTION
YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY MAN SHE CRIED NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HER INTO A PASSION BEFORE WHEN THE PRINCE SAW HER ASCEND HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED
TWO THREE FOUR HOURS PASSED IN THIS WAY THE PRINCESS APPARENTLY ASLEEP AND THE PRINCE VERY PATIENT BUT HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED IN HIS POSITION FOR HE HAD NONE OF THE CONSOLATION HE HAD HOPED FOR
WHAT THEN MUST WE DO SAID PANGLOSS HOLD YOUR TONGUE ANSWERED THE DERVISH I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
BUT WHEN SHE DID SHE FAINTED AWAY COMING TO HERSELF SHE SEIZED THE OARS KEPT HERSELF STEADY AS BEST SHE COULD AND ROWED AND ROWED THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ROWED BEFORE ROUND ROCKS AND OVER SHALLOWS AND THROUGH MUD SHE ROWED
THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
HA SAID PANGLOSS TO PAQUETTE PROVIDENCE HAS THEN BROUGHT YOU AMONGST US AGAIN MY POOR CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COST ME THE TIP OF MY NOSE AN EYE AND AN EAR AS YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WORLD IS THIS
I PRESUME IN GENERAL THAT THEY WHO MEDDLE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIE SOMETIMES MISERABLY AND THAT THEY DESERVE IT BUT I NEVER TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT IS TRANSACTING AT CONSTANTINOPLE
SAID THE PRINCESS BEYOND EVERYTHING ANSWERED HE FOR I HAVE FALLEN IN WITH THE ONLY PERFECT CREATURE I EVER SAW NO MORE OF THAT I AM TIRED OF IT SAID THE PRINCESS PERHAPS SHE SHARED HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO PUNNING
ASKED THE OLD MAN WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE STRANGLED MUFTI I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED THE WORTHY MAN AND I HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NAME OF ANY MUFTI NOR OF ANY VIZIER I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHOEBLACK SAID THE PRINCESS SO I AM SAID THE PRINCE I BLACKED YOUR LITTLE BOOTS THREE TIMES A DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL I COULD GET OF YOU PUT ME IN
THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY PLACED A LITTLE BOAT FOR HER THE WATER WAS NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT IT BUT THEY HOPED IT WOULD BE BEFORE LONG THEY LAID HER ON CUSHIONS PLACED IN THE BOAT WINES AND FRUITS AND OTHER NICE THINGS AND STRETCHED A CANOPY OVER ALL
HE BREATHED THROUGH HIS NOSTRILS THE PRINCESS LOOKED WILD IT COVERED HIS NOSTRILS HER EYES LOOKED SCARED AND SHONE STRANGE IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS HEAD FELL BACK THE WATER CLOSED OVER IT
AND THE SHORE STEEPER RISING MORE IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS WHICH SURROUNDED THE LAKE ON ALL SIDES AND KEPT SENDING IT MESSAGES OF SILVERY STREAMS FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND ALL NIGHT LONG HE SOON FOUND A SPOT WHENCE HE COULD SEE THE GREEN LIGHT IN THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
DIONYSIUS OF SYRACUSE PYRRHUS PERSEUS HANNIBAL JUGURTHA ARIOVISTUS CAESAR POMPEY NERO OTHO VITELLIUS DOMITIAN
THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES
LOVE AND WATER BROUGHT BACK ALL HER STRENGTH SHE GOT UNDER THE WATER AND PULLED AND PULLED WITH HER WHOLE MIGHT TILL AT LAST SHE GOT ONE LEG OUT THE OTHER EASILY FOLLOWED HOW SHE GOT HIM INTO THE BOAT SHE NEVER COULD TELL
BUT THE EXTREME IMPERTINENCE OF THE BARON DETERMINED HIM TO CONCLUDE THE MATCH
HEREUPON IT WAS THAT AS I HAVE SAID HE WAS A LITTLE BORED DO YOU WANT TO BUY UP THEIR LEASES HE ASKED WELL HAVE YOU GOT ANY LIVINGS SHE DEMANDED OH I SAY HE CRIED
WHAT AM I TO DO PERCY BEAUMONT WAS ANNOYED AS WELL HE HAD DEEMED IT HIS DUTY AS I HAVE NARRATED TO WRITE TO THE DUCHESS BUT HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT THIS DISTINGUISHED WOMAN WOULD ACT SO PROMPTLY UPON HIS HINT
HE KNEW THAT I COULD NOT HAVE A MORE KIND AND ATTENTIVE NURSE THAN HIMSELF AND FIRM IN THE HOPE HE FELT OF MY RECOVERY HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT INSTEAD OF DOING HARM
BUT I HAVE SAID THAT HE WAS A REASONABLE YOUNG MAN AND I CAN GIVE NO BETTER PROOF OF IT THAN THE FACT THAT HE REMARKED TO HIS COMPANION AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT AFTER ALL I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HER
HAVE YOU GOT A CLERGYMAN THAT IS LOOKING OUT BUT SHE MADE HIM TELL HER THAT HE HAD A CASTLE HE CONFESSED TO BUT ONE IT WAS THE PLACE IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BROUGHT UP
I HAVE LATELY BEEN SO DEEPLY ENGAGED IN ONE OCCUPATION THAT I HAVE NOT ALLOWED MYSELF SUFFICIENT REST AS YOU SEE BUT I HOPE I SINCERELY HOPE THAT ALL THESE EMPLOYMENTS ARE NOW AT AN END
AND SINCE YOU APPEAR IN SUCH GOOD SPIRITS I MAY SPEAK TO YOU ON ONE SUBJECT MAY I NOT I TREMBLED ONE SUBJECT WHAT COULD IT BE
AND HE HAD A STRONG INCORRUPTIBLE SENSE OF THE PROPRIETIES OF LIFE HIS KINSMAN MEANWHILE WAS HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF TALK WITH BESSIE ALDEN ON THE RED SEA ROCKS BEYOND THE LAWN
TO EVERY ONE OF THEM MADAM THAT IS NOT MY NAME THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE MESSENGERS CAME BACK AND SAID I HAVE TRAVELLED TWO DAYS WITHOUT HEARING OF ANY OTHER NAMES BUT YESTERDAY AS I WAS CLIMBING A HIGH HILL
HIS POSITION PERCY BEAUMONT REPEATED HIS RANK OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T GOT A PEERAGE LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THACKERAY
BUT HE WAS ABSENT ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS DURING WHICH WITH MISTER WESTGATE'S ASSISTANCE HE COMPLETELY SETTLED THIS PIECE OF BUSINESS THEY CERTAINLY DO THINGS QUICKLY IN NEW YORK HE OBSERVED TO HIS COUSIN
THEN THE LITTLE MAN BEGAN TO CHUCKLE AT THE THOUGHT OF HAVING THE POOR CHILD TO TAKE HOME WITH HIM TO HIS HUT IN THE WOODS AND HE CRIED OUT NOW LADY WHAT IS MY NAME IS IT JOHN ASKED SHE
REEL AWAY REEL AWAY STRAW INTO GOLD AND ROUND ABOUT THE WHEEL WENT MERRILY THE WORK WAS QUICKLY DONE AND THE STRAW WAS ALL SPUN INTO GOLD
AND ARE HIS PARENTS LIVING OH YES IF HIS FATHER WERE NOT LIVING HE WOULD BE A DUKE
HER FEATURES APPEARED TO CHANGE AND I THOUGHT THAT I HELD THE CORPSE OF MY DEAD MOTHER IN MY ARMS A SHROUD ENVELOPED HER FORM AND I SAW THE GRAVE WORMS CRAWLING IN THE FOLDS OF THE FLANNEL I STARTED FROM MY SLEEP WITH HORROR
AND SHE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN WHILE SHE CONTINUED THAT SLOW PACED PROMENADE WHICH ENABLED HER WELL ADJUSTED SKIRTS TO DISPLAY THEMSELVES SO ADVANTAGEOUSLY THAT UNFORTUNATELY IN AMERICA THERE WAS NO LEISURE CLASS
FROM A HIGH POINT OF VIEW IT WOULD BE VERY INSPIRING THE LESS ONE THINKS OF IT THE BETTER LORD LAMBETH AFFIRMED I THINK IT'S TREMENDOUS SAID BESSIE ALDEN AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION SHE ASKED HIM IF HE HAD ANY TENANTRY
OF EVENINGS AT OPEN WINDOWS OR ON THE PERPETUAL VERANDAS IN THE SUMMER STARLIGHT ABOVE THE WARM ATLANTIC THE YOUNG ENGLISHMEN WERE INTRODUCED TO EVERYBODY
LORD LAMBETH MADE HIS FAREWELLS BUT THE FEW LAST WORDS THAT HE EXCHANGED WITH BESSIE ALDEN ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE A PLACE IN OUR RECORD
HIS WIFE MORE THAN ONCE ANNOUNCED THAT SHE EXPECTED HIM ON THE MORROW BUT ON THE MORROW SHE WANDERED ABOUT A LITTLE WITH A TELEGRAM IN HER JEWELED FINGERS DECLARING IT WAS VERY TIRESOME THAT HIS BUSINESS DETAINED HIM IN NEW YORK
I FELT MY FLESH TINGLE WITH EXCESS OF SENSITIVENESS AND MY PULSE BEAT RAPIDLY I WAS UNABLE TO REMAIN FOR A SINGLE INSTANT IN THE SAME PLACE I JUMPED OVER THE CHAIRS CLAPPED MY HANDS AND LAUGHED ALOUD
THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY OFF WHILE THE NURSE LAUGHED AND THE BABY CROWED AND ALL THE COURT JEERED AT HIM FOR HAVING HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE FOR NOTHING AND SAID
I DID NOT BEFORE REMARK HOW VERY ILL YOU APPEAR SO THIN AND PALE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD BEEN WATCHING FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS YOU HAVE GUESSED RIGHT
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE MEMORY OF THIS PROMISE THAT MADE HIM SAY TO HIS COMPANION A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THAT HE RATHER WONDERED HE SHOULD BE SO FOND OF THAT GIRL IN THE FIRST PLACE HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW FOND I AM OF HER ASKED LORD LAMBETH
AND IN THE SECOND PLACE WHY SHOULDN'T I BE FOND OF HER I SHOULDN'T THINK SHE WOULD BE IN YOUR LINE WHAT DO YOU CALL MY LINE YOU DON'T SET HER DOWN AS FAST EXACTLY SO
IT STOPPED JUST WHERE I WAS STANDING AND ON THE DOOR BEING OPENED I PERCEIVED HENRY CLERVAL WHO ON SEEING ME INSTANTLY SPRUNG OUT MY DEAR FRANKENSTEIN EXCLAIMED HE HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU
AND THAT I AM AT LENGTH FREE I TREMBLED EXCESSIVELY I COULD NOT ENDURE TO THINK OF AND FAR LESS TO ALLUDE TO THE OCCURRENCES OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT I WALKED WITH A QUICK PACE
HIS HAIR WAS OF A LUSTROUS BLACK AND FLOWING HIS TEETH OF A PEARLY WHITENESS BUT THESE LUXURIANCES ONLY FORMED A MORE HORRID CONTRAST WITH HIS WATERY EYES
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INFUSING LIFE INTO AN INANIMATE BODY FOR THIS I HAD DEPRIVED MYSELF OF REST AND HEALTH I HAD DESIRED IT WITH AN ARDOUR THAT FAR EXCEEDED MODERATION
RUMPELSTILTSKIN SAID THE LADY SLYLY SOME WITCH TOLD YOU THAT SOME WITCH TOLD YOU THAT CRIED THE LITTLE MAN AND DASHED HIS RIGHT FOOT IN A RAGE SO DEEP INTO THE FLOOR THAT HE WAS FORCED TO LAY HOLD OF IT WITH BOTH HANDS TO PULL IT OUT
I DREADED TO BEHOLD THIS MONSTER BUT I FEARED STILL MORE THAT HENRY SHOULD SEE HIM ENTREATING HIM THEREFORE TO REMAIN A FEW MINUTES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS I DARTED UP TOWARDS MY OWN ROOM
A STEP TO WHICH PERCY BEAUMONT AT FIRST OFFERED SOME CONSCIENTIOUS OPPOSITION I CALL HIS OPPOSITION CONSCIENTIOUS BECAUSE IT WAS FOUNDED UPON SOME TALK THAT HE HAD HAD ON THE SECOND DAY WITH BESSIE ALDEN
I AFTERWARDS LEARNED THAT KNOWING MY FATHER'S ADVANCED AGE AND UNFITNESS FOR SO LONG A JOURNEY AND HOW WRETCHED MY SICKNESS WOULD MAKE ELIZABETH HE SPARED THEM THIS GRIEF BY CONCEALING THE EXTENT OF MY DISORDER
IS IT AN IMPORTANT POSITION SHE ASKED OH DEAR NO SAID LORD LAMBETH I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE VERY GRAND SAID BESSIE ALDEN TO POSSESS SIMPLY BY AN ACCIDENT OF BIRTH THE RIGHT TO MAKE LAWS FOR A GREAT NATION
OF UNIVERSAL FRIENDLINESS AND FRANKNESS OF OCCASIONS ON WHICH THEY KNEW EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING AND HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF EASE
ONLY TO BE FAIR HE ADDED YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD MY MOTHER ALSO THAT SHE IS NOT SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN ME PERCY BEAUMONT GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH THERE IS NOTHING SO CHARMING AS MODESTY IN A YOUNG MAN IN YOUR POSITION
HOW KIND HOW VERY GOOD YOU ARE TO ME THIS WHOLE WINTER INSTEAD OF BEING SPENT IN STUDY AS YOU PROMISED YOURSELF HAS BEEN CONSUMED IN MY SICK ROOM HOW SHALL I EVER REPAY YOU
AND DISCOVERED TO MY SLEEPLESS AND ACHING EYES THE CHURCH OF INGOLSTADT ITS WHITE STEEPLE AND CLOCK WHICH INDICATED THE SIXTH HOUR THE PORTER OPENED THE GATES OF THE COURT WHICH HAD THAT NIGHT BEEN MY ASYLUM AND I ISSUED INTO THE STREETS
AND ALL THOSE SCENES OF HOME SO DEAR TO MY RECOLLECTION I GRASPED HIS HAND AND IN A MOMENT FORGOT MY HORROR AND MISFORTUNE I FELT SUDDENLY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING MANY MONTHS CALM AND SERENE JOY
GOOD MORROW TO YOU MY GOOD LASS WHAT ARE YOU WEEPING FOR ALAS SAID SHE I MUST SPIN THIS STRAW INTO GOLD AND I KNOW NOT HOW WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME SAID THE HOBGOBLIN
COULD HE ALLUDE TO AN OBJECT ON WHOM I DARED NOT EVEN THINK COMPOSE YOURSELF SAID CLERVAL WHO OBSERVED MY CHANGE OF COLOUR I WILL NOT MENTION IT IF IT AGITATES YOU
BUT TELL ME HOW YOU LEFT MY FATHER BROTHERS AND ELIZABETH VERY WELL AND VERY HAPPY ONLY A LITTLE UNEASY THAT THEY HEAR FROM YOU SO SELDOM BY THE BY I MEAN TO LECTURE YOU A LITTLE UPON THEIR ACCOUNT MYSELF
HE HAD INDEED HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HER FOR SHE WAS NOT LITERALLY ALWAYS IN CONVERSATION WITH LORD LAMBETH HE HAD MEDITATED UPON MISSUS WESTGATE'S ACCOUNT OF HER SISTER
THOUGH IF IT WERE CONVENIENT I MIGHT PRESENT A RECORD OF IMPRESSIONS NONETHELESS DELECTABLE THAT THEY WERE NOT EXHAUSTIVELY ANALYZED MANY OF THEM STILL LINGER IN THE MINDS OF OUR TRAVELERS ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF HARMONIOUS IMAGES
YOU PREFER A BLUESTOCKING IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL MISS ALDEN HER SISTER TELLS ME SAID PERCY BEAUMONT THAT SHE IS TREMENDOUSLY LITERARY I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
I FEEL THE GREATEST REMORSE FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN THE OCCASION BUT YOU WILL FORGIVE ME YOU WILL REPAY ME ENTIRELY IF YOU DO NOT DISCOMPOSE YOURSELF BUT GET WELL AS FAST AS YOU CAN
THE FORM OF THE MONSTER ON WHOM I HAD BESTOWED EXISTENCE WAS FOREVER BEFORE MY EYES AND I RAVED INCESSANTLY CONCERNING HIM DOUBTLESS MY WORDS SURPRISED HENRY
I IMAGINED THAT THE MONSTER SEIZED ME I STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY AND FELL DOWN IN A FIT POOR CLERVAL WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN HIS FEELINGS A MEETING WHICH HE ANTICIPATED WITH SUCH JOY
HE AT FIRST BELIEVED THEM TO BE THE WANDERINGS OF MY DISTURBED IMAGINATION BUT THE PERTINACITY WITH WHICH I CONTINUALLY RECURRED TO THE SAME SUBJECT PERSUADED HIM THAT MY DISORDER INDEED OWED ITS ORIGIN TO SOME UNCOMMON AND TERRIBLE
HOW FORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE AT THE VERY MOMENT OF MY ALIGHTING NOTHING COULD EQUAL MY DELIGHT ON SEEING CLERVAL HIS PRESENCE BROUGHT BACK TO MY THOUGHTS MY FATHER ELIZABETH
IT WAS LORD LAMBETH'S THEORY FREELY PROPOUNDED WHEN THE YOUNG MEN WERE TOGETHER THAT PERCY BEAUMONT WAS HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME WITH MISSUS WESTGATE AND THAT UNDER THE PRETEXT OF MEETING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANIMATED DISCUSSION
BESSIE ALDEN LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT IS SHE VERY PLAIN BEAUMONT BEGAN TO LAUGH AGAIN YOU WOULD NOT FIND HER SO HANDSOME AS HER BROTHER HE SAID
NOW THE QUEEN LAY AWAKE ALL NIGHT THINKING OF ALL THE ODD NAMES THAT SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND SHE SENT MESSENGERS ALL OVER THE LAND TO FIND OUT NEW ONES THE NEXT DAY THE LITTLE MAN CAME AND SHE BEGAN WITH TIMOTHY
HIS LIMBS WERE IN PROPORTION AND I HAD SELECTED HIS FEATURES AS BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL GREAT GOD HIS YELLOW SKIN SCARCELY COVERED THE WORK OF MUSCLES AND ARTERIES BENEATH
HE PERFORMED THE KINDEST ACTION THAT HE COULD TOWARDS THEM BUT I WAS IN REALITY VERY ILL AND SURELY NOTHING BUT THE UNBOUNDED AND UNREMITTING ATTENTIONS OF MY FRIEND COULD HAVE RESTORED ME TO LIFE
AT OTHERS I NEARLY SANK TO THE GROUND THROUGH LANGUOR AND EXTREME WEAKNESS MINGLED WITH THIS HORROR I FELT THE BITTERNESS OF DISAPPOINTMENT
WE ASCENDED INTO MY ROOM AND THE SERVANT PRESENTLY BROUGHT BREAKFAST BUT I WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF IT WAS NOT JOY ONLY THAT POSSESSED ME
SHE HAS BEEN ASKING ME SAID BEAUMONT ALL ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR POSSESSIONS I AM SURE IT IS VERY GOOD OF HER LORD LAMBETH REJOINED WELL THEN OBSERVED HIS COMPANION IF YOU GO YOU GO WITH YOUR EYES OPEN
BUT I ESCAPED AND RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS I TOOK REFUGE IN THE COURTYARD BELONGING TO THE HOUSE WHICH I INHABITED WHERE I REMAINED DURING THE REST OF THE NIGHT WALKING UP AND DOWN IN THE GREATEST AGITATION
CLERVAL AT FIRST ATTRIBUTED MY UNUSUAL SPIRITS TO JOY ON HIS ARRIVAL BUT WHEN HE OBSERVED ME MORE ATTENTIVELY HE SAW A WILDNESS IN MY EYES FOR WHICH HE COULD NOT ACCOUNT
SO STRANGELY TURNED TO BITTERNESS BUT I WAS NOT THE WITNESS OF HIS GRIEF FOR I WAS LIFELESS AND DID NOT RECOVER MY SENSES FOR A LONG LONG TIME
THAT'S A GREAT PITY SAID BEAUMONT YOU WOULD FIND IT ALL SET FORTH THERE SO MUCH BETTER THAN I CAN DO IT HE IS A PEER THEN OH YES HE IS A PEER AND HAS HE ANY OTHER TITLE THAN LORD LAMBETH
TO SAY TO LORD LAMBETH THAT HE SUSPECTED THAT THE DUCHESS'S TELEGRAM WAS IN PART THE RESULT OF SOMETHING HE HIMSELF HAD WRITTEN TO HER I WROTE TO HER AS I EXPLICITLY NOTIFIED YOU I HAD PROMISED TO DO
PACING THEM WITH QUICK STEPS AS IF I SOUGHT TO AVOID THE WRETCH WHOM I FEARED EVERY TURNING OF THE STREET WOULD PRESENT TO MY VIEW I DID NOT DARE RETURN TO THE APARTMENT WHICH I INHABITED BUT FELT IMPELLED TO HURRY ON
THE FIRST LITTLE CHILD THAT YOU MAY HAVE WHEN YOU ARE QUEEN THAT MAY NEVER BE THOUGHT THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER AND AS SHE KNEW NO OTHER WAY TO GET HER TASK DONE SHE SAID SHE WOULD DO WHAT HE ASKED
BESSIE ALDEN APPEARED TO BE LOOKING AT HIM WITH INTEREST HE IS THE SON OF THE DUKE OF BAYSWATER HE ADDED PRESENTLY THE ELDEST SON THE ONLY SON
ENTERTAINED BY EVERYBODY INTIMATE WITH EVERYBODY AT THE END OF THREE DAYS THEY HAD REMOVED THEIR LUGGAGE FROM THE HOTEL AND HAD GONE TO STAY WITH MISSUS WESTGATE
ALL THIS MUST BE SPUN INTO GOLD BEFORE MORNING AS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE IT WAS IN VAIN THAT THE POOR MAIDEN SAID THAT IT WAS ONLY A SILLY BOAST OF HER FATHER
COLERIDGE'S ANCIENT MARINER CONTINUING THUS I CAME AT LENGTH OPPOSITE TO THE INN AT WHICH THE VARIOUS DILIGENCES AND CARRIAGES USUALLY STOPPED HERE I PAUSED I KNEW NOT WHY
NO MADAM IS IT TOM NO MADAM IS IT JEMMY IT IS NOT CAN YOUR NAME BE
SO THAT WHEN HIS FATHER DIES PURSUED BESSIE ALDEN WITH MORE SIMPLICITY THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN A CLEVER GIRL HE WILL BECOME DUKE OF BAYSWATER OF COURSE SAID PERCY BEAUMONT
PERCY BEAUMONT RETURNED WITH HIS COUSIN AND HIS SENSE OF DUTY COMPELLED HIM ONE WINDLESS AFTERNOON IN MID ATLANTIC
I BELIEVE I LEFT HIM INCREDULOUS TO THE LAST FOR HIS CONSTANT ANSWER TO MY UNWEARIED ENTREATIES WAS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE DUTCH SCHOOLMASTER IN THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD I HAVE TEN THOUSAND FLORINS A YEAR WITHOUT GREEK
LISTENING ATTENTIVELY CATCHING AND FEARING EACH SOUND AS IF IT WERE TO ANNOUNCE THE APPROACH OF THE DEMONIACAL CORPSE TO WHICH I HAD SO MISERABLY GIVEN LIFE OH NO MORTAL COULD SUPPORT THE HORROR OF THAT COUNTENANCE
MISSUS WESTGATE HOWEVER WAS NOT TO ENJOY MUCH LONGER THE ENTERTAINMENT WITH WHICH AN INDULGENT HUSBAND HAD DESIRED TO KEEP HER PROVIDED ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF AUGUST LORD LAMBETH RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM HIS MOTHER
AND HE MUTTERED SOME INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHILE A GRIN WRINKLED HIS CHEEKS HE MIGHT HAVE SPOKEN BUT I DID NOT HEAR ONE HAND WAS STRETCHED OUT SEEMINGLY TO DETAIN ME
AND MY LOUD UNRESTRAINED HEARTLESS LAUGHTER FRIGHTENED AND ASTONISHED HIM MY DEAR VICTOR CRIED HE WHAT FOR GOD'S SAKE IS THE MATTER DO NOT LAUGH IN THAT MANNER HOW ILL YOU ARE
THAT HE ONE DAY TOLD THE KING OF THE LAND WHO USED TO COME AND HUNT IN THE WOOD THAT HIS DAUGHTER COULD SPIN GOLD OUT OF STRAW NOW THIS KING WAS VERY FOND OF MONEY
AND WHEN HE HEARD THE MILLER'S BOAST HIS GREEDINESS WAS RAISED AND HE SENT FOR THE GIRL TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM THEN HE LED HER TO A CHAMBER IN HIS PALACE WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT HEAP OF STRAW AND GAVE HER A SPINNING WHEEL AND SAID
TO DO IT FOR YOU MY NECKLACE REPLIED THE MAIDEN HE TOOK HER AT HER WORD AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN TO THE WHEEL AND WHISTLED AND SANG ROUND ABOUT ROUND ABOUT LO AND BEHOLD
IT MEANS HE SAID THAT YOUR FATHER IS LAID UP I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S ANYTHING SERIOUS BUT YOU HAVE NO OPTION TAKE THE FIRST STEAMER BUT DON'T BE ALARMED
DAMN MY EYES EXCLAIMED LORD LAMBETH IF ONE IS TO BE A DOZEN TIMES A DAY AT THE HOUSE IT IS A GREAT DEAL MORE CONVENIENT TO SLEEP THERE I AM SICK OF TRAVELING UP AND DOWN THIS BEASTLY AVENUE
AND WE SOON ARRIVED AT MY COLLEGE I THEN REFLECTED AND THE THOUGHT MADE ME SHIVER THAT THE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LEFT IN MY APARTMENT MIGHT STILL BE THERE ALIVE AND WALKING ABOUT
BUT HIS FATHER IS IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND HIS MOTHER BEAUMONT SMILED A LITTLE THE DUCHESS IS UNCOMMONLY ROBUST AND HAS HE ANY SISTERS YES THERE ARE TWO
THE CHAMBER DOOR WAS LOCKED AND SHE WAS LEFT ALONE SHE SAT DOWN IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO BEWAIL HER HARD FATE WHEN ON A SUDDEN THE DOOR OPENED AND A DROLL LOOKING LITTLE MAN HOBBLED IN AND SAID
IN THE COURSE OF LONG ISLAND RIDES WITH A SLOW RETURN IN THE GLOWING TWILIGHT ON THE DEEP VERANDA LATE IN THE EVENING LORD LAMBETH WHO HAD STAYED AT MANY HOUSES
WITH AN ANXIETY THAT ALMOST AMOUNTED TO AGONY I COLLECTED THE INSTRUMENTS OF LIFE AROUND ME THAT I MIGHT INFUSE A SPARK OF BEING INTO THE LIFELESS THING THAT LAY AT MY FEET IT WAS ALREADY ONE IN THE MORNING
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT SO GREAT A GOOD FORTUNE COULD HAVE BEFALLEN ME BUT WHEN I BECAME ASSURED THAT MY ENEMY HAD INDEED FLED I CLAPPED MY HANDS FOR JOY AND RAN DOWN TO CLERVAL
AND WHAT ARE THEY CALLED ONE OF THEM IS MARRIED SHE IS THE COUNTESS OF PIMLICO AND THE OTHER THE OTHER IS UNMARRIED SHE IS PLAIN LADY JULIA
AND HE DISCOVERED FOR HIMSELF THAT THE YOUNG LADY WAS CLEVER AND APPEARED TO HAVE READ A GREAT DEAL SHE SEEMED VERY NICE THOUGH HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT AS MISSUS WESTGATE HAD SAID SHE WAS SHY
BUT I REMAINED SOME MINUTES WITH MY EYES FIXED ON A COACH THAT WAS COMING TOWARDS ME FROM THE OTHER END OF THE STREET AS IT DREW NEARER I OBSERVED THAT IT WAS THE SWISS DILIGENCE
MERRILY I'LL DANCE AND SING FOR NEXT DAY WILL A STRANGER BRING LITTLE DOES MY LADY DREAM RUMPELSTILTSKIN IS MY NAME WHEN THE QUEEN HEARD THIS SHE JUMPED FOR JOY
I FELT ALSO SENTIMENTS OF JOY AND AFFECTION REVIVE IN MY BOSOM MY GLOOM DISAPPEARED AND IN A SHORT TIME I BECAME AS CHEERFUL AS BEFORE I WAS ATTACKED BY THE FATAL PASSION
THEY WERE INDULGING IN PRACTICES THAT IMPARTED A SHADE OF HYPOCRISY TO THE LADY'S REGRET FOR HER HUSBAND'S ABSENCE I ASSURE YOU WE ARE ALWAYS DISCUSSING AND DIFFERING SAID PERCY BEAUMONT SHE IS AWFULLY ARGUMENTATIVE
MISSUS WESTGATE TELLS ME THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE FAST GIRL IN AMERICA THAT IT'S AN ENGLISH INVENTION AND THAT THE TERM HAS NO MEANING HERE ALL THE BETTER IT'S AN ANIMAL I DETEST
THEN SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE TO WEEP BUT THE DWARF SOON OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME TO DO YOUR TASK THE RING ON MY FINGER SAID SHE
OF COURSE I NEEDN'T ASSURE YOU HE SAID THAT IF YOU SHOULD COME TO ENGLAND NEXT YEAR I EXPECT TO BE THE FIRST PERSON THAT YOU INFORM OF IT BESSIE ALDEN LOOKED AT HIM A LITTLE AND SHE SMILED
DO NOT ASK ME CRIED I PUTTING MY HANDS BEFORE MY EYES FOR I THOUGHT I SAW THE DREADED SPECTRE GLIDE INTO THE ROOM HE CAN TELL OH SAVE ME SAVE ME
AND HE ADDED THAT MISTER WESTGATE HAD SEEMED VERY UNEASY LEST HIS WIFE SHOULD MISS HER VISITOR HE HAD BEEN IN SUCH AN AWFUL HURRY TO SEND HIM BACK TO HER I'M AFRAID YOU'LL NEVER COME UP TO AN AMERICAN HUSBAND IF THAT'S WHAT THE WIVES EXPECT HE SAID TO LORD LAMBETH
AND A CONVULSIVE MOTION AGITATED ITS LIMBS HOW CAN I DESCRIBE MY EMOTIONS AT THIS CATASTROPHE OR HOW DELINEATE THE WRETCH WHOM WITH SUCH INFINITE PAINS AND CARE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO FORM
A MUMMY AGAIN ENDUED WITH ANIMATION COULD NOT BE SO HIDEOUS AS THAT WRETCH I HAD GAZED ON HIM WHILE UNFINISHED HE WAS UGLY THEN BUT WHEN THOSE MUSCLES AND JOINTS WERE RENDERED CAPABLE OF MOTION
I SAW A LITTLE HUT AND BEFORE THE HUT BURNT A FIRE AND ROUND ABOUT THE FIRE A FUNNY LITTLE DWARF WAS DANCING UPON ONE LEG AND SINGING MERRILY THE FEAST I'LL MAKE TODAY I'LL BREW TOMORROW BAKE
THE RAIN PATTERED DISMALLY AGAINST THE PANES AND MY CANDLE WAS NEARLY BURNT OUT WHEN BY THE GLIMMER OF THE HALF EXTINGUISHED LIGHT I SAW THE DULL YELLOW EYE OF THE CREATURE OPEN IT BREATHED HARD
AND AS SOON AS HER LITTLE FRIEND CAME SHE SAT DOWN UPON HER THRONE AND CALLED ALL HER COURT ROUND TO ENJOY THE FUN AND THE NURSE STOOD BY HER SIDE WITH THE BABY IN HER ARMS AS IF IT WAS QUITE READY TO BE GIVEN UP
IF SHE WAS SHY SHE CARRIED IT OFF VERY WELL MISTER BEAUMONT SHE HAD SAID PLEASE TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT LORD LAMBETH'S FAMILY HOW WOULD YOU SAY IT IN ENGLAND HIS POSITION
I PERCEIVED THAT THE FALLEN LEAVES HAD DISAPPEARED AND THAT THE YOUNG BUDS WERE SHOOTING FORTH FROM THE TREES THAT SHADED MY WINDOW IT WAS A DIVINE SPRING AND THE SEASON CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO MY CONVALESCENCE
THIS YOUNG LADY NO LONGER APPLIED TO PERCY BEAUMONT FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING HIS LORDSHIP SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF DIRECTLY TO THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN SHE ASKED HIM A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS SOME OF WHICH BORED HIM A LITTLE
ROUND WENT THE WHEEL AGAIN TO THE OLD SONG AND THE MANIKIN ONCE MORE SPUN THE HEAP INTO GOLD THE KING CAME IN THE MORNING AND FINDING ALL HE WANTED WAS FORCED TO KEEP HIS WORD
ON LONG SEA ROADS BENEATH A SKY LIGHTED UP BY MARVELOUS SUNSETS OF SUPPERS ON THE RETURN INFORMAL IRREGULAR AGREEABLE
NOT NOW WAS THE CAUSE AN IMPERTINENCE IN TALL BLACK LETTERS IT WAS INSTEAD A SHINING BEACON IN LETTERS OF FLAME GUIDING STRAIGHT TO VICTORY
OH WELL I CAN STILL CALL HIM MARY JANE RETORTED BILLY WITH AIRY DISDAIN ALL THIS HOWEVER SO FAR AS BILLY COULD SEE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST HELPING ALONG THE CAUSE THAT HAD BECOME SO DEAR TO HER
THIS ISN'T AN UNDERSTUDY LIKE MARIE'S WEDDING YOU KNOW SHE FINISHED DEMURELY THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT BERTRAM HAD BREATHED FERVENTLY BUT EVEN AS HE SAID THE WORDS HE GREW SICK WITH FEAR WHAT IF AFTER ALL THIS WERE AN UNDERSTUDY TO WHAT WAS TO COME LATER WHEN MUSIC
IN THAT CASE AS THE OLD INDIAN SAID EVERYBODY WOULD WANT MY SQUAW IT WAS PLAIN THAT DIANA DID SEE SOMETHING IN FRED WRIGHT HOWEVER ANNE'S EYES MIGHT BE HOLDEN DIANA CAME TO GREEN GABLES THE NEXT EVENING A PENSIVE SHY YOUNG LADY
THAT ALL DEPENDS ON WHO YOU'RE ENGAGED TO ANSWERED DIANA WITH THAT
HER VOICE WHEN SHE RESUMED CARRIED THE STERN NOTE SO FAMILIAR TO BILLY IN HER FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER AS I PRESUME MISTER ARKWRIGHT HAS TOLD YOU WE HAVE MET WITH MANY CHANGES IN OUR LIFE CHANGES WHICH NECESSITATED A NEW HOME AND A NEW MODE OF LIVING
BESPOKE THE UNUSUAL FLASHING THE SIGNALS WHICH PROCLAIMED IT A DISPATCH BEARER FOR THE JEDDAK IT CIRCLED IMPATIENTLY AWAITING THE TARDY PATROL BOAT WHICH MUST CONVOY IT TO THE PALACE DOCKS
ALL BARSOOM I HAD TO FLY LOW TO GET SUFFICIENT AIR TO BREATHE BUT I TOOK A STRAIGHT COURSE ACROSS AN OLD SEA BOTTOM AND SO HAD TO RISE ONLY A FEW FEET ABOVE THE GROUND I TRAVELED WITH AWFUL VELOCITY FOR MY ERRAND WAS A RACE AGAINST TIME WITH DEATH
I KNEW I COULD TRUST FATHER TO PICK ME OUT A NICE LITTLE SECOND MOTHER HE SAID PROUDLY IT'S A FINE THING TO HAVE A FATHER YOU CAN DEPEND ON TEACHER I JUST LOVE MISS LAVENDAR GRANDMA IS PLEASED TOO SHE SAYS SHE'S REAL GLAD FATHER DIDN'T PICK OUT AN AMERICAN FOR HIS SECOND WIFE BECAUSE
BUT THE WORST WE FEAR HAS HAPPENED THE INSTRUMENTS SHOW A RAPIDLY DECREASING AIR PRESSURE ON ALL PARTS OF BARSOOM THE ENGINE HAS STOPPED MY GENTLEMEN HE CONCLUDED WE HAVE AT BEST THREE DAYS TO LIVE
YOU KNOW TEACHER CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH WAS ANOTHER RADIANT PERSON OH MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM IT HAS ALL TURNED OUT SO BEAUTIFUL
MEN CRAZED WITH FEAR HAVE SURGED ABOUT THIS PORTAL IN VAIN ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE ITS MYSTERY I HAD NO TIME TO TALK I WAS BECOMING VERY WEAK AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I CONTROLLED MY MIND AT ALL BUT WITH A FINAL EFFORT AS I SANK WEAKLY TO MY KNEES I HURLED
THE PEOPLE SEEMED NEVER TO TIRE OF HEAPING HONORS UPON ME AND NO DAY PASSED THAT DID NOT BRING SOME NEW PROOF OF THEIR LOVE FOR MY PRINCESS THE INCOMPARABLE DEJAH THORIS
TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY MANY OF THE WEAKER COMMENCED TO SUCCUMB AND WITHIN AN HOUR THE PEOPLE OF BARSOOM WERE SINKING BY THOUSANDS INTO THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS WHICH PRECEDES DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION
HIS RIVAL HAD REALLY CONQUERED BERTRAM KNEW THAT HOWEVER SECURE MIGHT SEEM BILLY'S AFFECTION FOR HIMSELF THERE WAS STILL IN HIS OWN MIND A HORRID FEAR LEST UNDERNEATH THAT SECURITY WERE AN UNCONSCIOUS
IF THE AIR SUPPLY REMAINED UNREPLENISHED I WELL KNEW AND SO THROWING CAUTION TO THE WINDS I FLUNG OVERBOARD EVERYTHING BUT THE ENGINE AND COMPASS
WHEN THE DELICATE SHELL SHOULD BREAK VIVID IN MY MEMORY IS THE PICTURE OF THE LAST NIGHT AS WE SAT THERE TALKING IN LOW TONES OF THE STRANGE ROMANCE WHICH HAD WOVEN OUR LIVES TOGETHER AND OF THIS WONDER WHICH WAS COMING TO AUGMENT OUR HAPPINESS
HE REPLIED IF YOU OPEN QUICKLY I CAN LAST BUT A FEW MOMENTS MORE BUT IT IS USELESS THEY ARE BOTH DEAD AND NO ONE ELSE UPON BARSOOM KNEW THE SECRET OF THESE AWFUL LOCKS FOR THREE DAYS
APPARELLED IN CELESTIAL LIGHT WEARING A GLORY AND A FRESHNESS NOT VISIBLE TO THOSE WHO LIKE HERSELF AND CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH LOOKED AT THINGS ONLY THROUGH PROSE WHEN'S THE WEDDING TO BE SHE ASKED AFTER A PAUSE THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST
AS IF SOMEHOW DIANA HAD GONE FORWARD INTO A NEW WORLD SHUTTING A GATE BEHIND HER LEAVING ANNE ON THE OUTSIDE THINGS ARE CHANGING SO FAST IT ALMOST FRIGHTENS ME ANNE THOUGHT A LITTLE SADLY AND I'M AFRAID
THE NINE THOUGHT WAVES AT THAT AWFUL THING BEFORE ME THE MARTIAN HAD CRAWLED TO MY SIDE AND WITH STARING EYES FIXED ON THE SINGLE PANEL BEFORE US WE WAITED IN THE SILENCE OF DEATH SLOWLY
MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE THOROUGHLY APPROVES OF THE MATCH AND THINKS ITS LIKELY MISS LAVENDAR WILL GIVE UP HER QUEER NOTIONS AND BE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE NOW THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE MARRIED
BANISH GILBERT'S IMAGE FROM HER CASTLE IN SPAIN BUT SOMEHOW HE WENT ON BEING THERE SO ANNE BEING IN A HURRY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT AND PURSUED HER AERIAL ARCHITECTURE WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT HER HOME O'DREAMS WAS BUILT AND FURNISHED BEFORE DIANA SPOKE AGAIN
SOME ONE THAT HE WAS NOT A FONDNESS THAT WOULD ONE DAY CAUSE BILLY TO AWAKE
THUS HAD COME THE BREAKING OF WHATEVER TIE THERE WAS BETWEEN ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT NOT TO HAVE BROKEN IT WOULD HAVE MEANT FOR ALICE THE PLACING OF HERSELF IN A POSITION WHERE SOMETIME APOLOGIES MUST BE MADE FOR HER FATHER
EVERYBODY CONCERNED IN MISS LAVENDAR'S STORY WAS VERY HAPPY
VERY FEARSOME INDEED TO SAY TO MISSUS GREGGORY THEN BILLY REMEMBERED HER CAUSE AND TOOK HEART BILLY WAS SPELLING IT NOW WITH A CAPITAL C FOR A LONG MINUTE MISSUS GREGGORY DID NOT ANSWER FOR SO LONG A MINUTE
LAY A SNOW WHITE EGG FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS TEN SOLDIERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD HAD CONSTANTLY STOOD OVER IT AND NOT A DAY PASSED WHEN I WAS IN THE CITY THAT DEJAH THORIS AND I DID NOT STAND HAND IN HAND BEFORE OUR LITTLE SHRINE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE
PUSHING THE SPEED LEVER TO ITS LAST NOTCH I SPLIT THE THIN AIR OF DYING MARS WITH THE SPEED OF A METEOR AN HOUR BEFORE DARK THE GREAT WALLS OF THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT LOOMED SUDDENLY BEFORE ME AND WITH A SICKENING
WHICH WAS WITHHOLDING THE SPARK OF LIFE FROM THE INHABITANTS OF AN ENTIRE PLANET BESIDE THE DOOR A GREAT CREW OF MEN HAD BEEN LABORING TO PIERCE THE WALL BUT THEY HAD SCARCELY SCRATCHED THE FLINT LIKE SURFACE
BUT EVEN SO IT'S NICE TO THINK ONE WAS AN INSTRUMENT USED BY PREDESTINATION YES INDEED IT'S VERY ROMANTIC I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S SO TERRIBLY ROMANTIC AT ALL SAID MARILLA RATHER CRISPLY
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN FROM JOY TO DEATH FOR TEN DAYS THE HORDES OF THARK AND THEIR WILD ALLIES WERE FEASTED AND ENTERTAINED AND THEN LOADED WITH COSTLY PRESENTS
I DO NOT NEED TO TELL YOU WHAT THIS MEANS TO BARSOOM IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS TO PENETRATE THOSE MIGHTY WALLS IN FACT THE WORK HAS ALREADY COMMENCED AND THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO FEAR WERE THE ENGINE OF THE PUMPING PLANT TO RUN AS IT SHOULD
BILLY LAUGHED BUT SHE FROWNED TOO I KNOW DEAR I DON'T LIKE THAT PART I WISH THEY WOULD LET ME ALONE WHEN I'M WITH YOU BUT AS FOR THE OPERETTA IT IS REALLY A GOOD THING DEAR AND YOU'LL SAY SO WHEN YOU SEE IT
AS I PRESSED HER DEAR LIPS TO MINE THE OLD FEELING OF UNCONQUERABLE POWER AND AUTHORITY ROSE IN ME THE FIGHTING BLOOD OF VIRGINIA SPRANG TO LIFE IN MY VEINS IT SHALL NOT BE MY PRINCESS
SHE WAS AND NEVER ASKED ANYBODY ANYTHING ABOUT HER AND NOW EVERYTHING HAS COME RIGHT AND I HAD A HAND IN BRINGING IT ABOUT PERHAPS AS MISSUS LYNDE SAYS
WITH ARKWRIGHT AND HIS FRIENDS THE GREGGORYS SO MUCH THERE WERE THE NEW SONGS AND THE OPERETTA WITH ITS REHEARSALS AS A CAUSE FOR IT ALL AT THE SAME TIME DEEP WITHIN HIS FEARFUL SOUL WAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ARKWRIGHT THE GREGGORYS AND THE OPERETTA WERE BUT
THE AVENUES AND PLAZAS OF HELIUM WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE ALL BUSINESS HAD CEASED FOR THE MOST PART THE PEOPLE LOOKED BRAVELY INTO THE FACE OF THEIR UNALTERABLE DOOM HERE AND THERE HOWEVER MEN AND WOMEN GAVE WAY TO QUIET GRIEF
BUT MY DEARS BOTH OF YOU BILLY HAD AT LAST SAID TO THEM JUST LISTEN WE SHALL HAVE
NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THEM HOW THEY SHOULD DIE LET US GO ABOUT OUR DUTIES AS THOUGH A THOUSAND USEFUL YEARS STILL LAY BEFORE US THE CHAMBER RANG WITH APPLAUSE
I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE MY PART IS ONLY A SMALL ONE YOU KNOW WE SHALL MAKE LOTS OF MONEY FOR THE HOME TOO I'M SURE BUT YOU'RE WEARING YOURSELF ALL OUT WITH IT DEAR SCOWLED BERTRAM
SO I TOLD HER ALL THAT I HAD HEARD WE HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY JOHN CARTER SHE SAID AND I THANK WHATEVER FATE OVERTAKES US THAT IT PERMITS US TO DIE TOGETHER
BUT AS THINGS SEEN ARE MIGHTIER THAN THINGS HEARD OR SUSPECTED THE REALIZATION THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY SO CAME TO HER WITH ALMOST THE SHOCK OF PERFECT SURPRISE THIS WAS SUCCEEDED BY A QUEER LITTLE LONELY FEELING
THEY STARTED ON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THEIR OWN LANDS THE JED OF LESSER HELIUM WITH A SMALL PARTY OF NOBLES ACCOMPANIED THEM ALL THE WAY TO THARK TO CEMENT MORE CLOSELY THE NEW BONDS OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
SO YOU SEE SHE FINISHED WHEN ALICE GREGGORY HAD DONE LAUGHING OVER THE TALE
NATURALLY UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES OLD FRIENDS AND OLD ROMANCES MUST CHANGE TOO BUT MISSUS GREGGORY STAMMERED BILLY I'M SURE MISTER ARKWRIGHT WOULD WANT AN UP LIFTED HAND SILENCED HER PEREMPTORILY
AND THERE WAS THE RAPTURE AND WRETCHEDNESS OF CHOOSING FASHIONS AND BEING FITTED ANNE AND DIANA SPENT HALF THEIR TIME AT ECHO LODGE AND THERE WERE NIGHTS WHEN ANNE COULD NOT SLEEP FOR WONDERING WHETHER SHE HAD DONE RIGHT IN ADVISING MISS LAVENDAR TO SELECT BROWN RATHER THAN NAVY BLUE FOR HER TRAVELING DRESS
WAITING HAPPILY FOR THE SUMMER TO BRING LIFE AND LAUGHTER BACK TO IT AGAIN THERE WAS MORE ROMANCE IN THE WORLD THAN THAT WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF THE MIDDLE AGED LOVERS OF THE STONE HOUSE
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IF YOU LOOK AT IT THROUGH POETRY AND I THINK IT'S NICER ANNE RECOVERED HERSELF AND HER EYES SHONE AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHED
CONDITIONS SEEMED MUCH WORSE HERE THAN AT HELIUM AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT I BREATHED AT ALL THERE WERE A FEW MEN STILL CONSCIOUS AND TO ONE OF THESE I SPOKE IF I CAN OPEN THESE DOORS IS THERE A MAN WHO CAN START THE ENGINES I ASKED I CAN
SHE GASPED OH IT DOES SEEM SO SO SO HOPELESSLY GROWN UP ANNE OF LATE HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT HER SUSPICIONS THAT DIANA WAS PROVING FALSE TO THE MELANCHOLY BYRONIC HERO OF HER EARLY DREAMS
THAT THIS CAN'T HELP MAKING SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIANA AND ME I'M SURE I CAN'T TELL HER ALL MY SECRETS AFTER THIS SHE MIGHT TELL FRED AND
MISTER ARKWRIGHT AND MISS GREGGORY BUT THEN THAT OF COURSE DID NOT SIGNIFY BILLY DECLARED TO HERSELF I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T EVER CALL HIM MARY JANE SHE SAID TO THE GIRL A LITTLE MISCHIEVOUSLY ONE DAY MARY JANE MISTER ARKWRIGHT NO I DON'T
SOLA ALSO ACCOMPANIED TARS TARKAS HER FATHER WHO BEFORE ALL HIS CHIEFTAINS HAD ACKNOWLEDGED HER AS HIS DAUGHTER
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE CAUSE AND BERTRAM FEBRUARY CAME THE OPERETTA FOR WHICH BILLY WAS WORKING SO HARD WAS TO BE GIVEN THE TWENTIETH THE ART EXHIBITION FOR WHICH BERTRAM WAS PREPARING HIS FOUR PICTURES WAS TO OPEN THE SIXTEENTH
THERE'S NOT MUCH COMFORT FOR THE REST OF US IN THAT SEEING THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE FRED LAUGHED ANNE OH ANNE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID DIANA IN VEXATION I DIDN'T MEAN THAT IT'S SO HARD TO EXPLAIN
BESIDES FRED'S FATHER IS GOING TO BUY THE ABRAHAM FLETCHER FARM FOR HIM AND HE SAYS HE'S GOT TO HAVE IT TWO THIRDS PAID FOR
REJOINED MISS GREGGORY WITH AN ODD SMILE THEN AFTER A MOMENT SHE ADDED I BELIEVE HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS USED TO HOWEVER YES I KNOW LAUGHED BILLY WE THOUGHT HE WAS A REAL MARY JANE ONCE AND SHE TOLD THE STORY OF HIS ARRIVAL
YOU MUST BE MY BRIDESMAID YOU KNOW ANNE PROMISE ME THAT WHEREVER YOU MAY BE WHEN I'M MARRIED
THE FACE OF DEJAH THORIS HUNG ALWAYS BEFORE ME AS I TURNED FOR A LAST LOOK AS I LEFT THE PALACE GARDEN I HAD SEEN HER STAGGER AND SINK UPON THE GROUND BESIDE THE LITTLE INCUBATOR THAT SHE HAD DROPPED INTO THE LAST COMA WHICH WOULD END IN DEATH
AND WILL HAVE TO STAY ALL NIGHT SEVERAL TIMES PROBABLY YOU MISSUS GREGGORY
AS THE AWE OF THE GRIM SHADOW OF DEATH CREPT OVER US EVEN WOOLA SEEMED TO FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE IMPENDING CALAMITY FOR HE PRESSED CLOSE TO DEJAH THORIS AND TO ME WHINING PITIFULLY
AS IF HE WANTED KATE'S OPINION ON THAT OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT CONCERNED HIM AND BILLY ONCE TORN BY JEALOUSY AND EXASPERATED AT THE FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS OF THEIR QUIET HOURS TOGETHER HE HAD COMPLAINED OPENLY ACTUALLY BILLY IT'S WORSE THAN MARIE'S WEDDING HE DECLARED
CRIED ANNE REPENTANTLY I WAS ONLY TEASING YOU A BIT I THINK YOU'LL MAKE THE SWEETEST LITTLE HOUSEKEEPER IN THE WORLD AND I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY LOVELY OF YOU TO BE PLANNING ALREADY FOR YOUR HOME O'DREAMS
ONCE THAT THERE WOULD BE A ROMANCE THERE THEY WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS AND THEY WERE WELL SUITED TO EACH OTHER IN TASTES AND TEMPERAMENT I THINK INDEED THAT THE ROMANCE WAS WELL UNDER WAY THOUGH THERE WAS NEVER AN ENGAGEMENT WHEN MISSUS GREGGORY PAUSED AND WET HER LIPS
ANNE STUMBLED SUDDENLY ON IT ONE EVENING WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO ORCHARD SLOPE BY THE WOOD CUT AND CAME OUT INTO THE BARRY GARDEN DIANA BARRY AND FRED WRIGHT WERE STANDING TOGETHER UNDER THE BIG WILLOW DIANA WAS LEANING AGAINST THE GRAY TRUNK HER LASHES CAST DOWN ON VERY CRIMSON CHEEKS
AIN'T MISTER IRVING SPLENDID HE JUST WORSHIPS THE GROUND SHE TREADS ON AND IT MAKES ME FEEL SO QUEER SOMETIMES TO SEE THE LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN HE'S WATCHING HER IT BEGGARS DESCRIPTION MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM I'M AWFUL THANKFUL THEY'RE SO FOND OF EACH OTHER IT'S THE BEST WAY WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE
AND FULFILL OUR HOPES IN THE DISTANCE WE SAW THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT OF AN APPROACHING AIRSHIP BUT WE ATTACHED NO SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO SO COMMON A SIGHT LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING IT RACED TOWARD HELIUM UNTIL ITS VERY SPEED
MARILLA THAT IS ROMANTIC EVEN IN PROSE THERE'S TO BE NOBODY THERE EXCEPT MISSUS IRVING AND PAUL AND GILBERT AND DIANA AND I AND MISS LAVENDAR'S COUSINS
THAT NOW SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW AS IT WAS BECOMING PERCEPTIBLY DIFFICULT TO BREATHE TARDOS MORS AROSE SAYING LET US BID EACH OTHER FAREWELL THE DAYS OF THE GREATNESS OF BARSOOM ARE OVER
WHICH THE WORLD CANNOT BESTOW OR TAKE AWAY OF LOOKING AT LIFE THROUGH SOME TRANSFIGURING OR REVEALING MEDIUM
NOW WHERE IS THE ROMANCE IN ALL THAT OH THERE ISN'T ANY WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY GASPED ANNE RATHER AS IF SOMEBODY HAD THROWN COLD WATER OVER HER I SUPPOSE THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS IN PROSE
THAT BILLY'S BREATH DROPPED INTO A FLUTTERING SIGH AND HER CAUSE BECAME SUDDENLY IMPERTINENCE SPELLED IN BLACK CAPITALS THEN MISSUS GREGGORY SPOKE SLOWLY A LITTLE SADLY I DON'T MIND SAYING TO YOU THAT I DID HOPE
WHICH THROUGH ALL ETERNITY MUST GO SWINGING THROUGH THE HEAVENS PEOPLED NOT EVEN BY MEMORIES IT IS THE END
WITH A PRIVATE VIEW FOR SPECIALLY INVITED FRIENDS THE EVENING BEFORE ON THE ELEVENTH DAY OF FEBRUARY MISSUS GREGGORY AND HER DAUGHTER ARRIVED AT HILLSIDE FOR A TEN DAYS VISIT NOT UNTIL AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF PLEADING AND ARGUMENT HOWEVER HAD BILLY BEEN ABLE TO BRING THIS ABOUT
I AM GLAD DIANA IS SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED BUT WHEN MY TURN COMES IF IT EVER DOES I DO HOPE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE THRILLING ABOUT IT BUT THEN DIANA THOUGHT SO TOO ONCE
EARNESTLY SOLICITOUS THAT IT SHOULD BE A SUCCESS SHE EVEN AS HE SOMETIMES HALF IRRITABLY REMEMBERED HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT SHE REALIZED HE BELONGED TO ART BEFORE HE DID TO HIMSELF AND WHEN HE HAD INDIGNANTLY DENIED THIS SHE HAD ONLY LAUGHED AND THROWN A KISS AT HIM
POETRY AND PROSE FOR THE NEXT MONTH ANNE LIVED IN WHAT FOR AVONLEA MIGHT BE CALLED A WHIRL OF EXCITEMENT THE PREPARATION OF HER OWN MODEST OUTFIT FOR REDMOND WAS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE
ARKWRIGHT AND ALICE GREGGORY HAD BEEN ALMOST LOVERS WHEN THE CHARGES AGAINST THE JUDGE'S HONOR HAD PLUNGED THE FAMILY INTO DESPAIRING HUMILIATION THEN HAD COME THE TIME WHEN ACCORDING TO ARKWRIGHT'S OWN STORY THE TWO WOMEN HAD SHUT THEMSELVES INDOORS REFUSED TO SEE THEIR FRIENDS AND LEFT TOWN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
MARILLA THOUGHT ANNE WAS TOO WORKED UP ABOUT IT AND HAD PLENTY TO DO WITH GETTING READY FOR COLLEGE WITHOUT TRAIPSING TO ECHO LODGE TWO DAYS OUT OF THREE HELPING MISS LAVENDAR
HE'S VERY NICE AND JOLLY BUT HE'S JUST FRED WRIGHT IT IS ALWAYS A VERY PUZZLING QUESTION WHAT CAN SOMEBODY SEE IN SOMEBODY ELSE BUT HOW FORTUNATE AFTER ALL THAT IT IS SO FOR IF EVERYBODY SAW ALIKE WELL
BERTRAM HENSHAW IN THE STRATA WAS AS IT HAPPENED NOT FALLING ASLEEP HE WAS LYING BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE BERTRAM VERY FREQUENTLY LAY BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE THESE DAYS OR RATHER NIGHTS HE TOLD HIMSELF ON THESE OCCASIONS
I WAS TOO WEAK AFTER IT I CRIED TO MY COMPANION AND IF YOU REACH THE PUMP ROOM TURN LOOSE ALL THE PUMPS IT IS THE ONLY CHANCE BARSOOM HAS TO EXIST TOMORROW FROM WHERE I LAY I OPENED THE SECOND DOOR
MISS GREGGORY LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE WHY IT'S SHE STOPPED SHORT HER EYES QUESTIONING WHY HASN'T HE EVER TOLD YOU SHE QUERIED BILLY LIFTED HER CHIN NO
RETURNED UPON A BATTLESHIP THAT HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO THARK TO FETCH THEM IN TIME FOR THE CEREMONY WHICH MADE DEJAH
MISTER ARKWRIGHT WAS VERY KIND AND A GENTLEMAN ALWAYS INTERPOSED THE LADY COLDLY BUT JUDGE GREGGORY'S DAUGHTER WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO BE PLACED WHERE APOLOGIES FOR HER FATHER WOULD BE NECESSARY EVER THERE PLEASE
PROMISED ANNE SOLEMNLY OF COURSE IT WON'T BE FOR EVER SO LONG YET SAID DIANA BLUSHING THREE YEARS AT THE VERY LEAST FOR I'M ONLY EIGHTEEN AND MOTHER SAYS NO DAUGHTER OF HERS SHALL BE MARRIED BEFORE SHE'S TWENTY ONE
HER EYES OPENED AND LOOKED INTO MINE KISS ME JOHN CARTER SHE MURMURED I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU IT IS CRUEL THAT WE MUST BE TORN APART WHO WERE JUST STARTING UPON
IT'S PERFECTLY LOVELY TO BE ENGAGED TO FRED
THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN A YOUNG NOBLE AROSE
THE NEXT TWO DAYS BROUGHT NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN THE SUPPLY OF AIR
DEAR MISS NEILSON LET US NOT TALK OF IT ANY MORE BEGGED MISSUS GREGGORY BROKENLY NO INDEED OF COURSE NOT CRIED BILLY BUT HER HEART REJOICED SHE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL NOW
NINE LONG FORGOTTEN SOUNDS LIKE A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE DARKNESS THEIR FULL PURPORT DAWNED UPON ME
MUSIC MUSIC THE SPECTRE THAT FROM THE FIRST HAD DOGGED HIS FOOTSTEPS WITH BILLY'S BEHAVIOR TOWARD HIMSELF BERTRAM COULD FIND NO FAULT SHE WAS ALWAYS HER SWEET LOYAL LOVABLE SELF EAGER TO HEAR OF HIS WORK
IF IT ISN'T METHUSELAH JOHN WHAT IS IT THEN BUT ALICE GREGGORY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE TOO IT SEEMED COULD BE FIRM ON OCCASION AND THOUGH SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY ALL SHE WOULD SAY WAS IF HE HASN'T TOLD YOU I SHA'N'T YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO HIM
EVER SINCE THE FIRST MEETING OF ALICE GREGGORY AND ARKWRIGHT BILLY HAD BEEN SORELY TROUBLED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE SHE HAD AS SHE MOURNFULLY TOLD HERSELF
HELPING HER ARRANGE PICTURES LAY OUT GARDENS AND ACCOMPLISH SUNDRY OTHER TASKS WHICH A PROUD AND MELANCHOLY HERO EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED BENEATH HIS DIGNITY ANNE TRIED TO
NEVER MIND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOMETIME WHEN YOUR OWN TURN COMES BLESS YOU DEAREST OF DIANAS I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT IS AN IMAGINATION FOR IF NOT TO ENABLE YOU TO PEEP AT LIFE THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S EYES
OR FAR WORSE STILL WITH OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN IT
AND WAS HAPPY WITH ALL THREE EXCEPT AT THE TIMES OF THE FUNERALS BUT I THINK SHE TOOK A RESK MISS SHIRLEY MA'AM OH IT'S ALL SO ROMANTIC BREATHED ANNE TO MARILLA THAT NIGHT
PACING BACK AND FORTH WITH TENSE DRAWN FACE WHEN ALL WERE IN THEIR SEATS HE TURNED TOWARD US THIS MORNING HE SAID
ONE HAND WAS HELD BY FRED WHO STOOD WITH HIS FACE BENT TOWARD HER STAMMERING SOMETHING IN LOW EARNEST TONES THERE WERE NO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THEIR TWO SELVES AT THAT MAGIC MOMENT SO NEITHER OF THEM SAW ANNE WHO AFTER ONE
WE WENT OUR WAYS WITH SMILES UPON OUR FACES AND SORROW GNAWING AT OUR HEARTS
MARILLA GLANCED AT THE RADIANT YOUNG FACE AND REFRAINED FROM FURTHER SARCASTIC COMMENTS PERHAPS SOME REALIZATION CAME TO HER THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE LIKE ANNE THE VISION AND THE FACULTY DIVINE THAT GIFT
ANNE HAD NO SOONER UTTERED THE PHRASE HOME O'DREAMS THAN IT CAPTIVATED HER FANCY AND SHE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THE ERECTION OF ONE OF HER OWN IT WAS OF COURSE TENANTED BY AN IDEAL MASTER DARK PROUD AND MELANCHOLY
HE STOOPED AND KISSED THE WOMEN OF HIS FAMILY AND LAID HIS STRONG HAND UPON THE SHOULDERS OF THE MEN AS I TURNED SADLY FROM HIM MY EYES FELL UPON DEJAH THORIS HER HEAD WAS DROOPING UPON HER BREAST TO ALL APPEARANCES SHE WAS LIFELESS
I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP HOUSE WITH ONLY THIRTY SIX DOILIES CONCEDED ANNE WITH A SOLEMN FACE BUT DANCING EYES DIANA LOOKED HURT I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D MAKE FUN OF ME ANNE SHE SAID REPROACHFULLY DEAREST I WASN'T MAKING FUN OF YOU
HE DID NOT WAIT TO QUESTION BUT IN AN INSTANT A GUARD WAS RACING TO THE NEAREST DOCK AND THOUGH THE AIR WAS THIN AND ALMOST GONE AT THE ROOFTOP THEY MANAGED TO LAUNCH THE FASTEST ONE MAN AIR SCOUT MACHINE THAT THE SKILL OF BARSOOM HAD EVER PRODUCED
I CRIED THERE IS THERE MUST BE SOME WAY AND JOHN CARTER WHO HAS FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH A STRANGE WORLD FOR LOVE OF YOU WILL FIND IT AND WITH MY WORDS THERE CREPT ABOVE THE THRESHOLD OF MY CONSCIOUS MIND A SERIES OF
BUT THREE YEARS ISN'T ANY TOO MUCH TIME TO GET READY FOR HOUSEKEEPING FOR I HAVEN'T A SPECK OF FANCY WORK MADE YET BUT I'M GOING TO BEGIN CROCHETING DOILIES TOMORROW
THAT THE KEEPER OF THE ATMOSPHERE PLANT HAD MADE NO WIRELESS REPORT FOR TWO DAYS NOR HAD ALMOST CEASELESS CALLS UPON HIM FROM A SCORE OF CAPITALS ELICITED A SIGN OF RESPONSE THE AMBASSADORS OF THE OTHER NATIONS ASKED US TO TAKE THE MATTER IN HAND
IT HAD BEEN THE GREAT GOOD AND PLEASURE WHICH THE VISIT WOULD BRING TO MISSUS GREGGORY THAT HAD BEEN THE FINAL STRAW TO TIP THE SCALES ON THE ELEVENTH OF FEBRUARY THEREFORE IN THE COMPANY OF THE ONCE SCORNED PEGGY AND MARY JANE ALICE GREGGORY AND HER MOTHER HAD ARRIVED AT HILLSIDE
MISS LAVENDAR WAS GETTING READY TO BE MARRIED AND THE STONE HOUSE WAS THE SCENE OF ENDLESS CONSULTATIONS AND PLANNINGS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH HOVERING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THINGS IN AGITATED DELIGHT AND WONDER THEN THE DRESSMAKER CAME
THEIR RUNNING ACROSS EACH OTHER LIKE THIS MISSUS GREGGORY SHE MURMURED AND THERE WAS A ROMANCE WASN'T THERE I HAVE JUST FELT IN MY BONES THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE BILLY HELD HER BREATH IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD MEANT TO SAY BUT NOW THAT SHE HAD SAID IT THE WORDS SEEMED
DEJAH THORIS AND I WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY HAD COLLECTED IN A SUNKEN GARDEN WITHIN AN INNER COURTYARD OF THE PALACE WE CONVERSED IN LOW TONES WHEN WE CONVERSED AT ALL
DAZED GLANCE OF COMPREHENSION TURNED AND SPED NOISELESSLY BACK THROUGH THE SPRUCE WOOD NEVER STOPPING TILL SHE GAINED HER OWN GABLE ROOM WHERE SHE SAT BREATHLESSLY DOWN BY HER WINDOW AND TRIED TO COLLECT HER SCATTERED WITS DIANA AND FRED ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
THE TALL SLENDER KIND BUT SOMEHOW I WOULDN'T WANT FRED TO BE TALL AND SLENDER BECAUSE DON'T YOU SEE HE WOULDN'T BE FRED THEN OF COURSE ADDED DIANA RATHER DOLEFULLY WE WILL BE A DREADFULLY PUDGY COUPLE
AND TOLD ANNE THE WHOLE STORY IN THE DUSKY SECLUSION OF THE EAST GABLE BOTH GIRLS CRIED AND KISSED AND LAUGHED I'M SO HAPPY SAID DIANA BUT IT DOES SEEM RIDICULOUS TO THINK OF ME BEING ENGAGED
THE TWO WERE CIVILITY ITSELF TO EACH OTHER BUT VERY PLAINLY THEY WERE NOT AT EASE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY AND BILLY MUCH TO HER SURPRISE HAD TO ADMIT THAT ARKWRIGHT DID NOT APPEAR TO APPRECIATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW THAT HE HAD THEM THE PAIR CALLED EACH OTHER CEREMONIOUSLY
AND HASTEN THE ASSISTANT KEEPER TO THE PLANT ALL DAY A THOUSAND CRUISERS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR HIM UNTIL JUST NOW ONE OF THEM RETURNS BEARING HIS DEAD BODY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE PITS BENEATH HIS HOUSE HORRIBLY MUTILATED BY SOME ASSASSIN
BUT ONLY ELICITED FROM HIS OWN WIFE A REPETITION OF HER LAST REPLY TELL THE WIND AND THE FIRE WHERE TO STOP NOT ME CUSTOMERS ENTERED AND THE GROUP WAS BROKEN UP THE ENGLISH CUSTOMER PAID FOR WHAT HE HAD HAD
TAKE A BUCKET OF ICE AND POUND IT FINE MIX WITH IT TWO QUARTS OF SALT PUT YOUR CREAM IN A FREEZER COVER IT CLOSE AND IMMERSE IT IN THE BUCKET DRAW THE ICE ROUND IT SO AS TO TOUCH EVERY PART AFTER IT HAS BEEN IN A FEW MINUTES PUT IN A SPOON AND STIR IT FROM THE EDGE TO THE CENTRE
DEFARGE WENT BACK TO THE COUNTER AND SAID CERTAINLY A LITTLE LIKE MADAME STERNLY RETORTED I TELL YOU A GOOD DEAL LIKE JACQUES THREE PACIFICALLY REMARKED
IT WILL BE DARK SOON AFTER FOUR LET US STRETCH THE HOUR OR TWO IF I GO TO MISTER LORRY'S AT NINE SHALL I HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE EITHER FROM OUR FRIEND OR FROM YOURSELF YES MAY YOU PROSPER MISTER LORRY
HAVING ASCERTAINED ITS SITUATION CARTON CAME OUT OF THOSE CLOSER STREETS AGAIN AND DINED AT A PLACE OF REFRESHMENT AND FELL SOUND ASLEEP AFTER DINNER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS HE HAD NO STRONG DRINK
AND HAD ONLY LEFT HER FOR A FEW MINUTES TO COME AND KEEP HIS APPOINTMENT HER FATHER HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE HE QUITTED THE BANKING HOUSE TOWARDS FOUR O'CLOCK SHE HAD SOME FAINT HOPES THAT HIS MEDIATION MIGHT SAVE CHARLES BUT THEY WERE VERY SLIGHT
THOUGH HE SAID IT WITH A GRAVE SMILE OF EARNESTNESS AND THOUGH HE EVEN PUT THE OLD MAN'S HAND TO HIS LIPS HE DID NOT PART FROM HIM THEN HE HELPED HIM SO FAR TO AROUSE THE ROCKING FIGURE BEFORE THE DYING EMBERS AS TO GET A CLOAK AND HAT PUT UPON IT
WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE NEXT ROOM HE TURNED SUDDENLY ON MISTER LORRY AND HER FATHER WHO WERE FOLLOWING AND SAID TO THE LATTER YOU HAD GREAT INFLUENCE BUT YESTERDAY DOCTOR MANETTE LET IT AT LEAST BE TRIED
EXTERMINATION IS GOOD DOCTRINE MY WIFE SAID DEFARGE RATHER TROUBLED IN GENERAL I SAY NOTHING AGAINST IT BUT THIS DOCTOR HAS SUFFERED MUCH YOU HAVE SEEN HIM TO DAY YOU HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE WHEN THE PAPER WAS READ
I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE REPEATED MADAME CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND ANGRILY YES I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE I HAVE OBSERVED HIS FACE TO BE NOT THE FACE OF A TRUE FRIEND OF THE REPUBLIC LET HIM TAKE CARE OF HIS FACE
HE HAD BEEN MORE THAN FIVE HOURS GONE WHERE COULD HE BE MISTER LORRY WAITED UNTIL TEN BUT DOCTOR MANETTE NOT RETURNING AND HE BEING UNWILLING TO LEAVE LUCIE ANY LONGER IT WAS ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD GO BACK TO HER AND COME TO THE BANKING HOUSE AGAIN AT MIDNIGHT
AFTER LOOKING AT HER AS IF THE SOUND OF EVEN A SINGLE FRENCH WORD WERE SLOW TO EXPRESS ITSELF TO HIM HE ANSWERED IN HIS FORMER STRONG FOREIGN ACCENT YES MADAME YES I AM ENGLISH
GOT INTO IT AND HE TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE THE DRIVER WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE GATEWAY WHERE HE HAD PAUSED IN THE DARK NOT MANY HOURS BEFORE TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF ON WHICH OF THE ROUGH STONES OF THE STREET HER FEET HAD TRODDEN HE LIFTED HER AGAIN
THE AMIABLE VENGEANCE ADDED WITH A LAUGH YES MY FAITH AND YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE TO SEEING HIM ONCE MORE TO MORROW CARTON FOLLOWED THE LINES AND WORDS OF HIS PAPER WITH A SLOW FOREFINGER
MISTER LORRY HELD IT OPEN IN HIS HAND GAZING IN HIS EARNEST FACE KEEP IT FOR ME UNTIL TO MORROW I SHALL SEE HIM TO MORROW YOU REMEMBER AND I HAD BETTER NOT TAKE IT INTO THE PRISON WHY NOT I DON'T KNOW I PREFER NOT TO DO SO
AND HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE DEFARGE HAD DESCRIBED HIMSELF THAT DAY AS THE KEEPER OF A WINE SHOP IN THE SAINT ANTOINE SUBURB IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ONE WHO KNEW THE CITY WELL TO FIND HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTION
PROMISE ME SOLEMNLY THAT NOTHING WILL INFLUENCE YOU TO ALTER THE COURSE ON WHICH WE NOW STAND PLEDGED TO ONE ANOTHER NOTHING CARTON REMEMBER THESE WORDS TO MORROW CHANGE THE COURSE OR DELAY IN IT FOR ANY REASON AND NO LIFE
CAN POSSIBLY BE SAVED AND MANY LIVES MUST INEVITABLY BE SACRIFICED I WILL REMEMBER THEM I HOPE TO DO MY PART FAITHFULLY AND I HOPE TO DO MINE NOW GOOD BYE
OF THE RESTLESS FINGERS AND THE CROAKING VOICE THIS MAN WHOM HE HAD SEEN UPON THE JURY STOOD DRINKING AT THE LITTLE COUNTER IN CONVERSATION WITH THE DEFARGES MAN AND WIFE THE VENGEANCE ASSISTED IN THE CONVERSATION LIKE A REGULAR MEMBER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
WHO HAD DONE WITH IT IT WAS AS LATE AS SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN HE AWOKE REFRESHED AND WENT OUT INTO THE STREETS AGAIN AS HE PASSED ALONG TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE HE STOPPED AT A SHOP WINDOW WHERE THERE WAS A MIRROR
MISTER LORRY LEANED HIS ARM UPON THE DOOR POST AND BOWED HIS FACE UPON IT DON'T DESPOND SAID CARTON VERY GENTLY DON'T GRIEVE I ENCOURAGED DOCTOR MANETTE IN THIS IDEA BECAUSE I FELT THAT IT MIGHT ONE DAY BE
BOTH HER HEARERS DERIVED A HORRIBLE ENJOYMENT FROM THE DEADLY NATURE OF HER WRATH THE LISTENER COULD FEEL HOW WHITE SHE WAS WITHOUT SEEING HER AND BOTH HIGHLY COMMENDED IT DEFARGE A WEAK MINORITY INTERPOSED A FEW WORDS FOR THE MEMORY OF THE COMPASSIONATE WIFE OF THE MARQUIS
IT IS A SOUND PRECAUTION AND MAY BE A NECESSARY PREPARATION BUT CARE CARE CARE LET ME THINK IT OUT CHECKING HIS STEPS WHICH HAD BEGUN TO TEND TOWARDS AN OBJECT
BY MANY PASSAGES HAD NOT CEASED WHEN LUCIE STOOD STRETCHING OUT HER ARMS TOWARDS HER HUSBAND WITH NOTHING IN HER FACE BUT LOVE AND CONSOLATION IF I MIGHT TOUCH HIM IF I MIGHT EMBRACE HIM ONCE O GOOD CITIZENS IF YOU WOULD HAVE SO MUCH COMPASSION FOR US
AND WITH A RADIANT LOOK UPON HER FACE IN WHICH THERE WAS EVEN A COMFORTING SMILE AS HE WENT OUT AT THE PRISONERS DOOR SHE TURNED LAID HER HEAD LOVINGLY ON HER FATHER'S BREAST TRIED TO SPEAK TO HIM AND FELL AT HIS FEET
CONSOLATORY TO HER
WHILE SHE ONLY FAINTS OH CARTON CARTON DEAR CARTON CRIED LITTLE LUCIE SPRINGING UP AND THROWING HER ARMS PASSIONATELY ROUND HIM IN A BURST OF GRIEF NOW THAT YOU HAVE COME I THINK YOU WILL DO SOMETHING TO HELP MAMMA
ALL OF PITY THAT HAD A FLUSH OF PRIDE IN IT SHALL I TAKE HER TO A COACH I SHALL NEVER FEEL HER WEIGHT HE CARRIED HER LIGHTLY TO THE DOOR AND LAID HER TENDERLY DOWN IN A COACH HER FATHER AND THEIR OLD FRIEND
YOU KNOW IT IS A CAPITAL CRIME TO MOURN FOR OR SYMPATHISE WITH A VICTIM OF THE GUILLOTINE SHE AND HER FATHER WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY BE GUILTY OF THIS CRIME AND THIS WOMAN THE INVETERACY OF WHOSE PURSUIT CANNOT BE DESCRIBED
OR ALL OF THESE MEN WERE DISPOSED TO SPARE HIM WHICH IS A LARGE SUPPOSITION FOR WHAT IS HIS LIFE OR ANY MAN'S TO THEM I DOUBT IF THEY DURST SPARE HIM AFTER THE DEMONSTRATION IN THE COURT AND SO DO I I HEARD THE FALL OF THE AXE IN THAT SOUND
BUT I WILL DO MY DUTY WHILE I CAN AND WHEN I LEAVE HER GOD WILL RAISE UP FRIENDS FOR HER AS HE DID FOR ME HER FATHER HAD FOLLOWED HER AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN ON HIS KNEES TO BOTH OF THEM BUT THAT DARNAY PUT OUT A HAND AND SEIZED HIM CRYING NO NO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
HE TOOK A TURN OR TWO IN THE ALREADY DARKENING STREET AND TRACED THE THOUGHT IN HIS MIND TO ITS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES HIS FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CONFIRMED IT IS BEST HE SAID FINALLY RESOLVED
IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE SAID THE PRISONER ALL THINGS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER AS THEY HAVE FALLEN OUT IT WAS THE ALWAYS VAIN ENDEAVOUR TO DISCHARGE MY POOR MOTHER'S TRUST THAT FIRST BROUGHT MY FATAL PRESENCE NEAR YOU GOOD COULD NEVER COME OF SUCH EVIL
WE KNOW NOW WHAT YOU UNDERWENT WHEN YOU SUSPECTED MY DESCENT AND WHEN YOU KNEW IT WE KNOW NOW THE NATURAL ANTIPATHY YOU STROVE AGAINST AND CONQUERED FOR HER DEAR SAKE
THEY SPOKE IN SUCH A TONE AS THEY WOULD HAVE USED IF THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING BY A SICK BED IN THE NIGHT CARTON STOOPED TO PICK UP THE COAT WHICH LAY ALMOST ENTANGLING HIS FEET
NOW TAKE THIS PAPER THAT DOCTOR MANETTE HAS CARRIED ABOUT HIM IT IS A SIMILAR CERTIFICATE ENABLING HIM AND HIS DAUGHTER AND HER CHILD AT ANY TIME TO PASS THE BARRIER AND THE FRONTIER YOU SEE YES
STRAIN IT THROUGH A COLANDER AND SKIM OFF ALL THE FAT THAT IS ON THE TOP SET IT AWAY TO COOL AND WHEN THE JELLY IS QUITE STIFF WIPE IT WITH A TOWEL TO TAKE OFF ANY GREASE THAT SHOULD REMAIN
THEN ISSUING FROM THE OBSCURE CORNER FROM WHICH HE HAD NEVER MOVED SYDNEY CARTON CAME AND TOOK HER UP ONLY HER FATHER AND MISTER LORRY WERE WITH HER HIS ARM TREMBLED AS IT RAISED HER AND SUPPORTED HER HEAD YET
NOT IF TO LIFT THIS GLASS WOULD DO IT BUT I WOULD LEAVE THE MATTER THERE I SAY STOP THERE SEE YOU THEN JACQUES SAID MADAME DEFARGE WRATHFULLY AND SEE YOU TOO MY LITTLE VENGEANCE SEE YOU BOTH LISTEN
CARTON TOOK IT UP AND THERE WAS A FOLDED PAPER IN IT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THIS HE SAID MISTER LORRY NODDED HIS CONSENT HE OPENED IT AND EXCLAIMED THANK GOD WHAT IS IT ASKED MISTER LORRY EAGERLY
THE ENGLISH CUSTOMER WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS REFLECTIONS THEN THAT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD DEED TO SEIZE THAT ARM LIFT IT AND STRIKE UNDER IT SHARP AND DEEP BUT HE WENT HIS WAY AND WAS SOON SWALLOWED UP IN THE SHADOW OF THE PRISON WALL
EARLY TO MORROW HAVE YOUR HORSES READY SO THAT THEY MAY BE IN STARTING TRIM AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IT SHALL BE DONE HIS MANNER WAS SO FERVENT AND INSPIRING THAT MISTER LORRY CAUGHT THE FLAME AND WAS AS QUICK AS YOUTH YOU ARE A NOBLE HEART

WHEN HE HAD REVEALED HIS OWN DESOLATE HEART TO IT OUTWATCHED THE AWFUL NIGHT HE ENTERED THE COURTYARD AND REMAINED THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALONE LOOKING UP AT THE LIGHT IN THE WINDOW OF HER ROOM BEFORE HE WENT AWAY HE BREATHED A BLESSING TOWARDS IT
YES RETURNED MISTER LORRY DRYING HIS EYES YOU ARE RIGHT BUT HE WILL PERISH THERE IS NO REAL HOPE YES HE WILL PERISH THERE IS NO REAL HOPE ECHOED CARTON
WHEN EGGS ARE USED IN CALF'S FOOT AND OTHER JELLIES CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HAVE THE INGREDIENTS COOL
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US IF THOSE SHOES ARE NOT DONE TO NIGHT LOST UTTERLY LOST IT WAS SO CLEARLY BEYOND HOPE TO REASON WITH HIM OR TRY TO RESTORE HIM THAT AS IF BY AGREEMENT THEY EACH PUT A HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER

IT IS SO ASSENTED DEFARGE AGAIN I COMMUNICATE TO HIM THAT SECRET I SMITE THIS BOSOM WITH THESE TWO HANDS AS I SMITE IT NOW AND I TELL HIM DEFARGE I WAS BROUGHT UP AMONG THE FISHERMEN OF THE SEA SHORE

OF LITTLE WORTH AS LIFE IS WHEN WE MISUSE IT IT IS WORTH THAT EFFORT IT WOULD COST NOTHING TO LAY DOWN IF IT WERE NOT I WILL GO SAID DOCTOR MANETTE TO THE PROSECUTOR AND THE PRESIDENT STRAIGHT
HE KNOWS THAT A WOOD SAWYER LIVING BY THE PRISON WALL IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE DEFARGES AND HAS BEEN REHEARSED BY MADAME DEFARGE AS TO HIS HAVING SEEN HER HE NEVER MENTIONED LUCIE'S NAME MAKING SIGNS AND SIGNALS TO PRISONERS

BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS
AND HASTILY SCANNED ITS PAGES AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PLATFORM IN THE WAKE OF THE CAPABLE PORTER WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER RUGS AND HAND BAGGAGE IN THE PERSONAL COLUMN SHE FOUND THE VERY PARAGRAPH SHE SOUGHT
AN HOUR AFTER SHE HAD READ IT SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD TO CAIRO EMBARKED AT ALEXANDRIA THE NEXT DAY LANDED AT BRINDISI
WELL SAID THE DOCTOR NIAGARA IS A BIG THING ISN'T IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME WERE YOU NOT DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA WE WERE I FEEL TEMPTED TO WISH FOR ONE HOMICIDAL MOMENT THAT THE EARTH WOULD OPEN HER MOUTH AND SWALLOW THEM UP

YOU KNOW NOTHING OF HER FORMER LIFE AND LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED NO MATTER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOOKING THROUGH A PERSON'S EYES INTO THE HEART AND LEARNING MORE OF THE HEIGHT AND BREADTH
THAT JANE'S HALF CROWN WAS NOT A PENNY HE HAD A SICK YOUNG WIFE AT HOME WHO HAD BEEN ORDERED EXTRA NOURISHMENT AND JUST AS THE RUSH ON BOARD BEGAN HE HAD PUT UP A SIMPLE PRAYER TO THE HEAVENLY FATHER
WHOM SHE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO LET US CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AND WHO ARTHUR WITH SUCH AN AIR OF MYSTERY TOLD US WAS HIS MAMMA'S FRIEND YES ROSE I REMEMBER IT ALL AND I CAN FORGIVE YOUR UNCHARITABLE CONCLUSIONS
YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS AND JANE SEATED IN A COMFORTABLE CORNER CHOKED BACK THE TEARS OF RELIEF WHICH THREATENED TO FALL DRANK HER COFFEE AND WAS THEREBY MORE REVIVED THAN SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE
AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
SHE CALLED ME GILBERT BY MY EXPRESS DESIRE AND I CALLED HER HELEN FOR I HAD SEEN THAT NAME WRITTEN IN HER BOOKS I SELDOM ATTEMPTED TO SEE HER ABOVE TWICE A WEEK
WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
IN TIME FOR TEA BUT OFFERED TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATELY PREPARED IF HE WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO PARTAKE OF IT NOT ANY FOR ME I THANK YOU REPLIED HE I SHALL BE AT HOME IN A FEW MINUTES OH BUT DO STAY AND TAKE A LITTLE
WHAT QUARRELLING MARKHAM CRIED THE LATTER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO ME
PROVIDED YOU NEVER ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE I MAKE NO EMPTY PROMISES BUT YOU SHALL SEE THE MOMENT YOU DO OUR INTIMACY IS AT AN END THAT'S ALL AND WILL YOU ALWAYS CALL ME GILBERT
THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY
YOU MUST SUPPOSE ABOUT THREE WEEKS PASSED OVER MISSUS GRAHAM AND I WERE NOW ESTABLISHED FRIENDS OR BROTHER AND SISTER AS WE RATHER CHOSE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES
PEOPLE WHO CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA AND TALK ABOUT IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CRAWL ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MOTHER ISN'T SHE WORTH KNOWING I HOPE SHE SENT ME HER LOVE AND NEW YORK HARBOUR
AND THE SCANDAL MONGERS HAVE GREEDILY SEIZED THE RUMOUR TO MAKE IT THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN INFERNAL STRUCTURE WELL BUT GILBERT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TO COUNTENANCE SUCH REPORTS DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN HER MANNER
YET I COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS AT TIMES UNHAPPY AND DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF OR HER POSITION AND TRULY I MYSELF WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE LATTER THIS ASSUMPTION OF BROTHERLY NONCHALANCE WAS VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN
THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MISTER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY
MERE CHANCE AND YET TO JANE IT SEEMED SO LIKE HIM TO HAVE TAKEN UP HIS POSITION PRECISELY AT THE RIGHT SPOT ON THAT LONG PLATFORM AN ENTHUSIASTIC LADY PATIENT HAD ONCE SAID OF DERYCK BRAND WITH MORE ACCURACY OF DEFINITION THAN OF GRAMMAR
THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
AND THIS NIGHT AND DAY TRAVELLING HAD BROUGHT HER AT LAST WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SHORES OF ENGLAND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WOULD SET FOOT UPON THEM AND THEN THERE WOULD BE BUT TWO MORE STAGES TO HER JOURNEY FOR FROM THE MOMENT SHE STARTED
WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
NO CERTAINLY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY
REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER WHY SO MISTER MILLWARD ASKED I HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED
AND I SAW A FLASH OF ECSTATIC BRILLIANCE IN HER EYE A GLOW OF GLAD EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE I THOUGHT MY HOUR OF VICTORY WAS COME BUT INSTANTLY A PAINFUL RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO FLASH UPON HER
AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME BREWED ALE
IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MISSUS MARKHAM SAID HE I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE
BUT I QUICKLY RE CAPTURED THE PONY SCARCE LESS ASTONISHED THAN ITS MASTER AT SUCH UNCIVIL USAGE REALLY MISTER MARKHAM THIS IS TOO MUCH SAID THE LATTER CAN I NOT GO TO SEE MY TENANT ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS WITHOUT BEING ASSAULTED IN THIS MANNER BY
MISSUS GRAHAM AND I ARE TWO FRIENDS AND WILL BE AND NO MAN BREATHING SHALL HINDER IT OR HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE BETWEEN US BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW THEY TALK YOU WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL FOR HER SAKE AS WELL AS FOR YOUR OWN
PILOTED JANE THROUGH THE CROWD OPENED THE DOOR OF A NEAT ELECTRIC BROUGHAM HELPED HER IN TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE HER AND THEY GLIDED SWIFTLY OUT INTO THE STRAND AND TURNED TOWARDS TRAFALGAR SQUARE
AFTER HER CURT NOD FROM A DISTANCE HAD ENGAGED HIM HE HAD RESPONDED TO THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A FUSSY LITTLE WOMAN WITH MANY MORE BAGS AND RUGS AND A PARROT CAGE WHO WAS NOW DOLING FRENCH COPPERS OUT OF THE WINDOW OF THE NEXT COMPARTMENT
STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
EMBLEM OF THE UNDENIABLE PURITY OF ENGLAND THE STAINLESS HONOUR AND INTEGRITY OF HER THRONE HER CHURCH HER PARLIAMENT HER COURTS OF JUSTICE AND HER DEALINGS AT HOME AND ABROAD WHETHER WITH FRIEND OR FOE
AND THEN OF OTHER THINGS THE EVENING WAS KIND AND GENIAL AND SO WAS MY COMPANION BY DEGREES I WAXED MORE WARM AND TENDER THAN PERHAPS I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
WHEN ALL WERE GONE I LEARNT THAT THE VILE SLANDER HAD INDEED BEEN CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VICTIM ROSE HOWEVER VOWED SHE DID NOT AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT
AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM IT IS JUST SIX WEEKS BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED MY DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
AND HER OWN MAID WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE IN THE DUCHESS'S HOUSEHOLD IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS ON THE PLATFORM AND HER HAND WAS IN DERYCK'S THAT IS RIGHT DEAR HE SAID ALL FIT AND WELL I CAN SEE NOW HAND OVER YOUR KEYS
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOTHING CONTRABAND I TELEPHONED THE DUCHESS TO SEND SOME OF HER PEOPLE TO MEET YOUR LUGGAGE AND NOT TO EXPECT YOU HERSELF UNTIL DINNER TIME AS YOU WERE TAKING TEA WITH US WAS THAT RIGHT THIS WAY COME OUTSIDE THE BARRIER WHAT A RABBLE
BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY
BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
AND IN TRUTH THE VICAR WAS JUST BEHIND ME PLODDING HOMEWARD FROM SOME REMOTE CORNER OF HIS PARISH I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE SQUIRE AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY SALUTING MISTER MILLWARD AS HE PASSED
THE WELL KNOWN NERVE SPECIALIST IN CONSULTATION WITH THE OCULIST AND THE LOCAL PRACTITIONER IN CHARGE OF THE CASE THERE IS A FEELING OF WIDE SPREAD REGRET AND SYMPATHY IN THOSE SOCIAL AND ARTISTIC CIRCLES WHERE MISTER DALMAIN WAS SO WELL KNOWN AND SO DESERVEDLY POPULAR
YOU KNOW HE IS ALWAYS SO VERY JUST THERE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOCTOR HAD MADE HIM TO MANY A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF TROUBLE HE WAS THROUGH THE LINE OF PORTERS AND HAD HIS HAND UPON THE HANDLE OF JANE'S DOOR IN A MOMENT
A GREAT CALM TOOK ITS PLACE AND JANE DROPPED QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS WASHED AND BRUSHED AND GREATLY REFRESHED
BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
AND SO THEY DARE TO TURN MY FRIENDSHIP INTO FOOD FOR FURTHER SCANDAL AGAINST HER THAT PROVES THE FALSEHOOD OF THEIR OTHER LIES AT ALL EVENTS IF ANY PROOF WERE WANTING MIND YOU CONTRADICT THEM ROSE WHENEVER YOU CAN
BUT SHE OFFERED NO EXTENUATION OR DEFENCE AND WITH A KIND OF SHAMELESS CALMNESS SHOCKING INDEED TO WITNESS IN ONE SO YOUNG AS GOOD AS TOLD ME THAT MY REMONSTRANCE WAS UNAVAILING AND MY PASTORAL ADVICE QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER
I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER GRADUALLY BECAME MORE SOLID AND DISTINCT UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ROSE FROM THE SEA A STRONG WHITE WALL
SEVEN PENCE APENNY OF THIS STUFF AIN'T MUCH FOR CARRYING ALL THAT ALONG I DON'T THINK GRUMBLED HIS MATE AND JANE'S YOUNG PORTER EXPERIENCED THE DOUBLE JOY OF FAITH CONFIRMED AND WILLING SERVICE GENEROUSLY REWARDED A TELEGRAPH BOY WALKED ALONG THE TRAIN SAYING
OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
OVER THE FIRST HALF CROWN HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF MILK AND NEW LAID EGGS NOW AS HE POCKETED THE SECOND HE ADDED THE OTHER TWO THINGS MENTIONED BY THE PARISH DOCTOR SOUP AND JELLY AND HIS HEART GLOWED
MISSUS GRAHAM HERSELF WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT THERE WAS ARTHUR PLAYING WITH HIS FROLICSOME LITTLE DOG IN THE GARDEN I LOOKED OVER THE GATE AND CALLED HIM TO ME HE WANTED ME TO COME IN BUT I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S LEAVE
BUT I AM FULLY DETERMINED MISSUS MARKHAM THAT MY DAUGHTERS SHALL NOT CONSORT WITH HER DO YOU ADOPT THE SAME RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO YOURS AS FOR YOUR SONS AS FOR YOU YOUNG MAN HE CONTINUED STERNLY TURNING TO ME
HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
THE NEXT MINUTE SAW ME HURRYING WITH RAPID STRIDES IN THE DIRECTION OF WILDFELL HALL TO WHAT INTENT OR PURPOSE I COULD SCARCELY TELL BUT I MUST BE MOVING SOMEWHERE AND NO OTHER GOAL WOULD DO
WHO KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS ASKING THAT HE MIGHT CATCH THE EYE OF A GENEROUS TRAVELLER HE FELT HE HAD INDEED BEEN LED TO THIS PLAIN BROWN FACED BROAD SHOULDERED LADY WHEN HE REMEMBERED HOW NEARLY
IS IT SIR SAID I AY IT IS SO HE ADDED AN AFFIRMATORY NOD AND CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON ME WITH A KIND OF IRATE SOLEMNITY HOLDING HIS SUBSTANTIAL STICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES
THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HIM JANE KNEW BUT SHE FELT UTTERLY UNABLE TO ARRANGE HOW OR IN WHAT WAY HER GOING COULD BE MANAGED THAT IT WAS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM HER COMMON SENSE TOLD HER
AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME
ALL WANTING TO BREAK EVERY POSSIBLE RULE AND REGULATION AND EACH TRYING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON IN THE FRONT ROW REALLY THE PATIENCE AND GOOD TEMPER OF RAILWAY OFFICIALS SHOULD TEACH THE REST OF MANKIND A LESSON THE DOCTOR TALKING ALL THE TIME
BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME
SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND ME WITH A BANG THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND MADE MY MOTHER SCREAM AND GAVE A MOMENTARY RELIEF TO MY EXCITED FEELINGS
I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR CALLING YOU OUT ON SUCH A LOVELY EVENING THOUGH IT BE FOR A MATTER OF NO GREATER IMPORTANCE TELL HIM TO COME IN MAMMA SAID ARTHUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN ASKED THE LADY YES
SHE READ HIS TELEGRAM THROUGH ONCE MORE AND SMILED HOW LIKE HIM TO THINK OF THE COFFEE AND OH HOW LIKE HIM TO BE COMING TO THE STATION SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND LEANED BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONS
I WILL NOT I REPLIED BUT YOU PARDON THIS OFFENCE ON CONDITION THAT YOU NEVER REPEAT IT AND MAY I COME TO SEE YOU NOW AND THEN PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY
AND DEPTH OF ANOTHER'S SOUL IN ONE HOUR THAN IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO DISCOVER IF HE OR SHE WERE NOT DISPOSED TO REVEAL IT OR IF YOU HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HER THIS EVENING
JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
HE WILL ALWAYS BE BLIND DEAR BUT LIFE HOLDS OTHER THINGS BESIDE SIGHT WE MUST NEVER SAY NO HOPE WILL HE LIVE THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
STANDING AT THE WINDOW SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE FIRM LEAN FACE NOW ALIGHT WITH WELCOME AND READ IN THE KIND STEADFAST EYES OF HER CHILDHOOD'S FRIEND A PERFECT SYMPATHY AND COMPREHENSION THEN SHE SAW BEHIND HIM HER AUNT'S FOOTMAN
WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
AND HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT SAYING SHE HAD FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES FROM WHOM SHE WISHED HER PRESENT RESIDENCE TO BE CONCEALED AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF THEIR TRACING HER OUT AND THEN HOW SUDDENLY SHE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THAT PERSON CAME
AND THAT HER SUREST WAY TO GARTH LAY THROUGH THE DOCTOR'S CONSULTING ROOM SO SHE TELEGRAPHED TO DERYCK FROM PARIS AND AT PRESENT HER MIND SAW NO FURTHER THAN WIMPOLE STREET AT DOVER SHE BOUGHT A PAPER
HAVE COFFEE AT DOVER DERYCK JANE GAVE ONE HARD TEARLESS SOB OF THANKFULNESS AND RELIEF SHE HAD BEEN SO LONELY THEN SHE TURNED TO THE WINDOW HERE SOMEBODY FETCH ME A CUP OF COFFEE WILL YOU
AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH
AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
AND THIS WAS SUCH A DAY I COULD NOT HELP GOING TO HIM UP IN HIS ROOM BEFORE WE SET OFF TO ADVISE HIM NOT TO VENTURE HE WAS PUTTING ON HIS WIG SO I SAID COACHMAN
I DID INDEED IT MIGHT NOT BE SAVING THEM MUCH BUT IT WAS SOMETHING AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO SIT AT MY EASE AND BE DRAGGED UP AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE NOBLE ANIMALS I CAUGHT A DREADFUL COLD BUT THAT I DID NOT REGARD MY OBJECT WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN THE VISIT
THE SLIGHTEST MENTION OF ANYTHING RELATIVE TO WILLOUGHBY OVERPOWERED HER IN AN INSTANT
BUT THERE WAS A SOMETHING IN SIR THOMAS WHEN THEY SAT ROUND THE SAME TABLE WHICH MADE MISTER YATES THINK IT WISER TO LET HIM PURSUE HIS OWN WAY AND FEEL THE FOLLY OF IT WITHOUT OPPOSITION HE HAD KNOWN MANY DISAGREEABLE FATHERS BEFORE
AND ANOTHER PAUSE SUCCEEDED THIS WAS BROKEN BY WILLOUGHBY WHO SAID WITH A FAINT SMILE IT IS FOLLY TO LINGER IN THIS MANNER I WILL NOT TORMENT MYSELF ANY LONGER BY REMAINING AMONG FRIENDS WHOSE SOCIETY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOW TO ENJOY
ONE MOMENT SHE FEARED THAT NO SERIOUS DESIGN HAD EVER BEEN FORMED ON HIS SIDE AND THE NEXT THAT SOME UNFORTUNATE QUARREL HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HER SISTER
BUT MY HEART QUITE ACHED FOR HIM AT EVERY JOLT AND WHEN WE GOT INTO THE ROUGH LANES ABOUT STOKE WHERE WHAT WITH FROST AND SNOW UPON BEDS OF STONES IT WAS WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE I WAS QUITE IN AN AGONY ABOUT HIM
AND NO REASON IN THE WORLD TO THINK ILL OF TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MOTIVES UNANSWERABLE IN THEMSELVES THOUGH UNAVOIDABLY SECRET FOR A WHILE AND AFTER ALL WHAT IS IT YOU SUSPECT HIM OF
IN SUCH A CASE A PLAIN AND OPEN AVOWAL OF HIS DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HIS HONOUR I THINK AS WELL AS MORE CONSISTENT WITH HIS GENERAL CHARACTER BUT I WILL NOT RAISE OBJECTIONS AGAINST ANY ONE'S CONDUCT ON SO ILLIBERAL A FOUNDATION
WHERE THEY FOUND ONLY WILLOUGHBY WHO WAS LEANING AGAINST THE MANTEL PIECE WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THEM HE TURNED ROUND ON THEIR COMING IN AND HIS COUNTENANCE SHEWED THAT HE STRONGLY PARTOOK OF THE EMOTION WHICH OVER POWERED MARIANNE
IT SEEMS BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT AND LAST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US SO HAPPY SO CHEERFUL SO AFFECTIONATE AND NOW AFTER ONLY TEN MINUTES NOTICE GONE TOO WITHOUT INTENDING TO RETURN
AND TOM HAD TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING WITH PROPER APOLOGIES FOR HIS FATHER'S PARTICULARITY WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED MISTER YATES FELT IT AS ACUTELY AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED
MISSUS NORRIS BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT HER AND WONDER THAT HIS FALLING IN LOVE WITH JULIA HAD COME TO NOTHING AND COULD ALMOST FEAR THAT SHE HAD BEEN REMISS HERSELF IN FORWARDING IT BUT WITH SO MANY TO CARE FOR
ENTIRELY AT AN END LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY AT HIS FATHER THE PAINTER WAS SENT OFF YESTERDAY AND VERY LITTLE WILL REMAIN OF THE THEATRE TO MORROW I KNEW HOW THAT WOULD BE FROM THE FIRST IT IS EARLY FOR BATH YOU WILL FIND NOBODY THERE
AND THAT HE FELT FOR US THE ATTACHMENT OF THE NEAREST RELATION HAVE WE NOT PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER HAS NOT MY CONSENT BEEN DAILY ASKED BY HIS LOOKS HIS MANNER HIS ATTENTIVE AND AFFECTIONATE RESPECT
AND NOW ELINOR WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY NOTHING FOR YOU HAVE ANTICIPATED MY ANSWER THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED
WHICH HIS ACTIONS CONTRADICTED OR TO BURY THE TUMULT OF HER FEELINGS UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF SOCIETY FOR GENERAL CIVILITIES SOON CALLED HIS NOTICE FROM HER AND THE FAREWELL VISIT AS IT THEN BECAME OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGED WAS A VERY SHORT ONE HE WAS GONE
AND THE MUSIC WHICH SIR THOMAS CALLED FOR FROM HIS DAUGHTERS HELPED TO CONCEAL THE WANT OF REAL HARMONY
WITH A PURER SPIRIT DID FANNY REJOICE IN THE INTELLIGENCE SHE HEARD IT AT DINNER AND FELT IT A BLESSING BY ALL THE OTHERS IT WAS MENTIONED WITH REGRET AND HIS MERITS HONOURED WITH DUE GRADATION OF FEELING
HE BELIEVED HE SHOULD CERTAINLY ATTACK THE BARONET ON THE ABSURDITY OF HIS PROCEEDINGS AND ARGUE HIM INTO A LITTLE MORE RATIONALITY HE BELIEVED THIS VERY STOUTLY WHILE HE WAS IN MANSFIELD WOOD AND ALL THE WAY HOME
HIS DECIDED PREFERENCE OF A QUIET FAMILY PARTY TO THE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION OF ACTING HE SEEMED TO FEEL EXACTLY AS ONE COULD WISH YES INDEED AND THE MORE YOU KNOW OF HIM THE BETTER YOU WILL LIKE HIM HE IS NOT A SHINING CHARACTER
YOU MUST THINK WRETCHEDLY INDEED OF WILLOUGHBY IF AFTER ALL THAT HAS OPENLY PASSED BETWEEN THEM YOU CAN DOUBT THE NATURE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH THEY ARE TOGETHER HAS HE BEEN ACTING A PART IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO YOUR SISTER ALL THIS TIME
SHOULD LEAVE HER AND LEAVE HER PERHAPS FOR MONTHS WITHOUT TELLING HER OF HIS AFFECTION THAT THEY SHOULD PART WITHOUT A MUTUAL EXCHANGE OF CONFIDENCE I CONFESS REPLIED ELINOR
HER SENSATIONS WERE INDEFINABLE AND SO WERE THEY A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS UPON HEARING HENRY CRAWFORD WHO HAD A CHAIR BETWEEN HERSELF AND TOM ASK THE LATTER IN AN UNDERVOICE WHETHER THERE WERE ANY PLANS FOR RESUMING THE PLAY
IS SHE ILL I HOPE NOT HE REPLIED
BUT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR SEPARATION
HER ONLY RESOURCE WAS TO GET OUT OF THE SUBJECT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND TURN THE CURRENT OF SIR THOMAS'S IDEAS INTO A HAPPIER CHANNEL SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO INSINUATE IN HER OWN PRAISE
HE LEFT THE HOUSE IN ALL THE SOBERNESS OF ITS GENERAL CHARACTER AND SIR THOMAS HOPED IN SEEING HIM OUT OF IT TO BE RID OF THE WORST OBJECT CONNECTED WITH THE SCHEME AND THE LAST THAT MUST BE INEVITABLY REMINDING HIM OF ITS EXISTENCE
IT WAS NOT INCLINATION THAT HE WANTED ELINOR I COULD PLAINLY SEE THAT HE HAD NOT THE POWER OF ACCEPTING IT I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER I ASSURE YOU
HE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY CONDITION WITH HIS UNCLE FOR ATTENDING THEM WHENEVER HE MIGHT BE WANTED THE PLAY SHOULD NOT BE LOST BY HIS ABSENCE FROM BATH NORFOLK LONDON YORK WHEREVER I MAY BE SAID HE
HE FELT IT TOO MUCH INDEED FOR MANY WORDS AND HAVING SHAKEN HANDS WITH EDMUND MEANT TO TRY TO LOSE THE DISAGREEABLE IMPRESSION AND FORGET HOW MUCH HE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN HIMSELF AS SOON AS HE COULD
BUT YOU ELINOR WHO LOVE TO DOUBT WHERE YOU CAN IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOU I KNOW BUT YOU SHALL NOT TALK ME OUT OF MY TRUST IN IT I AM PERSUADED THAT MISSUS SMITH SUSPECTS HIS REGARD FOR MARIANNE DISAPPROVES OF IT
AND MADE A POINT OF BEING INTRODUCED TO HIS MOTHER AND THEN PREVAILED ON MY SISTER TO PAY THE FIRST VISIT I AM AS CERTAIN AS I SIT HERE THAT NOTHING WOULD HAVE COME OF IT FOR MISTER RUSHWORTH IS THE SORT OF AMIABLE MODEST YOUNG MAN WHO WANTS A GREAT DEAL OF ENCOURAGEMENT
AND WHILE THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION
THE HAND WHICH HAD SO PRESSED HERS TO HIS HEART THE HAND AND THE HEART WERE ALIKE MOTIONLESS AND PASSIVE NOW HER SPIRIT SUPPORTED HER BUT THE AGONY OF HER MIND WAS SEVERE SHE HAD NOT LONG TO ENDURE WHAT AROSE FROM LISTENING TO LANGUAGE
I WANT NO PROOF OF THEIR AFFECTION SAID ELINOR BUT OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT I DO I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED OF BOTH YET NOT A SYLLABLE HAS BEEN SAID TO YOU ON THE SUBJECT BY EITHER OF THEM
YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THEY WERE GOING TO BE MARRIED UNGRACIOUS GIRL BUT I REQUIRE NO SUCH PROOF NOTHING IN MY OPINION HAS EVER PASSED TO JUSTIFY DOUBT NO SECRECY HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED ALL HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY OPEN AND UNRESERVED
THOUGH WE HAVE NOT KNOWN HIM LONG HE IS NO STRANGER IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND WHO HAS EVER SPOKEN TO HIS DISADVANTAGE HAD HE BEEN IN A SITUATION TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY AND MARRY IMMEDIATELY
YOU CANNOT DOUBT YOUR SISTER'S WISHES IT MUST BE WILLOUGHBY THEREFORE WHOM YOU SUSPECT BUT WHY IS HE NOT A MAN OF HONOUR AND FEELING HAS THERE BEEN ANY INCONSISTENCY ON HIS SIDE TO CREATE ALARM CAN HE BE DECEITFUL
THAT WHERE THE PRESENT PLEASURE OF THOSE SHE LOVED WAS AT STAKE HER KINDNESS DID SOMETIMES OVERPOWER HER JUDGMENT IT WAS A BUSY MORNING WITH HIM CONVERSATION WITH ANY OF THEM OCCUPIED BUT A SMALL PART OF IT
EVERY ONE WAS SILENT MISSUS DASHWOOD FIRST SPOKE I HAVE ONLY TO ADD MY DEAR WILLOUGHBY
WHICH THIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE OCCASIONED ELINOR'S UNEASINESS WAS AT LEAST EQUAL TO HER MOTHER'S SHE THOUGHT OF WHAT HAD JUST PASSED WITH ANXIETY AND DISTRUST
HE COULD NOT HELP GIVING MISSUS NORRIS A HINT OF HIS HAVING HOPED THAT HER ADVICE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTERPOSED TO PREVENT WHAT HER JUDGMENT MUST CERTAINLY HAVE DISAPPROVED THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN VERY INCONSIDERATE IN FORMING THE PLAN
FOR I WILL NOT PRESS YOU TO RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE YOU ONLY CAN JUDGE HOW FAR THAT MIGHT BE PLEASING TO MISSUS SMITH AND ON THIS HEAD I SHALL BE NO MORE DISPOSED TO QUESTION YOUR JUDGMENT THAN TO DOUBT YOUR INCLINATION
AND HAD HEARD NO TIDINGS BEYOND A FRIENDLY NOTE OF CONGRATULATION AND INQUIRY FROM MISSUS GRANT TO LADY BERTRAM IT WAS THE FIRST DAY FOR MANY MANY WEEKS IN WHICH THE FAMILIES HAD BEEN WHOLLY DIVIDED FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS HAD NEVER PASSED BEFORE
AND WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND HE ONLY REPLIED YOU ARE TOO GOOD MISSUS DASHWOOD LOOKED AT ELINOR WITH SURPRISE ELINOR FELT EQUAL AMAZEMENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS
IT MAY BE PROPER TO CONCEAL THEIR ENGAGEMENT IF THEY ARE ENGAGED FROM MISSUS SMITH AND IF THAT IS THE CASE
YOUR LADY AND I SHALL BE VERY SAFE YOU KNOW HOW STEADY STEPHEN IS AND CHARLES HAS BEEN UPON THE LEADERS SO OFTEN NOW THAT I AM SURE THERE IS NO FEAR BUT HOWEVER I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO HE WAS BENT UPON GOING
DO NOT BLAME HIM HOWEVER FOR DEPARTING FROM HIS CHARACTER WHERE THE DEVIATION IS NECESSARY BUT YOU REALLY DO ADMIT THE JUSTICE OF WHAT I HAVE SAID IN HIS DEFENCE I AM HAPPY AND HE IS ACQUITTED NOT ENTIRELY
HE IS MOREOVER AWARE THAT SHE DOES DISAPPROVE THE CONNECTION HE DARES NOT THEREFORE AT PRESENT CONFESS TO HER HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH MARIANNE AND HE FEELS HIMSELF OBLIGED
MISTER RUSHWORTH HAD SET OFF EARLY WITH THE GREAT NEWS FOR SOTHERTON AND SHE HAD FONDLY HOPED FOR SUCH AN IMMEDIATE ECLAIRCISSEMENT AS MIGHT SAVE HIM THE TROUBLE OF EVER COMING BACK AGAIN BUT THEY HAD SEEN NO ONE FROM THE PARSONAGE NOT A CREATURE
AND IS MISSUS SMITH YOUR ONLY FRIEND IS ALLENHAM THE ONLY HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO WHICH YOU WILL BE WELCOME FOR SHAME WILLOUGHBY CAN YOU WAIT FOR AN INVITATION HERE
AS TO GENERAL ATTENTION TO THE INTEREST AND COMFORT OF HIS FAMILY MUCH EXERTION AND MANY SACRIFICES TO GLANCE AT IN THE FORM OF HURRIED WALKS AND SUDDEN REMOVALS FROM HER OWN FIRESIDE AND MANY EXCELLENT HINTS OF DISTRUST AND ECONOMY
IT WAS OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE TO HER THAT CRAWFORD SHOULD NOW LOSE NO TIME IN DECLARING HIMSELF AND SHE WAS DISTURBED THAT EVEN A DAY SHOULD BE GONE BY WITHOUT SEEMING TO ADVANCE THAT POINT SHE HAD BEEN EXPECTING TO SEE HIM THE WHOLE MORNING
TO BE A SECOND TIME DISAPPOINTED IN THE SAME WAY WAS AN INSTANCE OF VERY SEVERE ILL LUCK AND HIS INDIGNATION WAS SUCH THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR DELICACY TOWARDS HIS FRIEND AND HIS FRIEND'S YOUNGEST SISTER
I HAVE NOT WANTED SYLLABLES WHERE ACTIONS HAVE SPOKEN SO PLAINLY HAS NOT HIS BEHAVIOUR TO MARIANNE AND TO ALL OF US FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FORTNIGHT DECLARED THAT HE LOVED AND CONSIDERED HER AS HIS FUTURE WIFE
AFTER THE PRESENT HAPPY INTERRUPTION WITH A COURTEOUS GLANCE AT SIR THOMAS
ARE YOU GOING THIS MORNING ALMOST THIS MOMENT THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE
I WILL ATTEND YOU FROM ANY PLACE IN ENGLAND AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE IT WAS WELL AT THAT MOMENT THAT TOM HAD TO SPEAK AND NOT HIS SISTER HE COULD IMMEDIATELY SAY WITH EASY FLUENCY I AM SORRY YOU ARE GOING
WHO WANTED NEITHER PRIDE NOR RESOLUTION WAS PREPARING TO ENCOUNTER HER SHARE OF IT WITH TOLERABLE CALMNESS
YOU WILL FIND FANNY EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH SIR THOMAS SAW ALL THE IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH A SCHEME AMONG SUCH A PARTY AND AT SUCH A TIME AS STRONGLY AS HIS SON HAD EVER SUPPOSED HE MUST
IT IS I WHO MAY RATHER EXPECT TO BE ILL FOR I AM NOW SUFFERING UNDER A VERY HEAVY DISAPPOINTMENT DISAPPOINTMENT YES FOR I AM UNABLE TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT WITH YOU
SAID SHE AS SHE SAT DOWN TO WORK AND WITH HOW HEAVY A HEART DOES HE TRAVEL IT IS ALL VERY STRANGE
WAS IN HAVING FORMED THE CONNEXION WITH THE RUSHWORTHS THERE SHE WAS IMPREGNABLE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE CREDIT OF BRINGING MISTER RUSHWORTH'S ADMIRATION OF MARIA TO ANY EFFECT IF I HAD NOT BEEN ACTIVE SAID SHE
WAS QUITE OVERCOME SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND LEFT THE ROOM THIS VIOLENT OPPRESSION OF SPIRITS CONTINUED THE WHOLE EVENING SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY POWER BECAUSE SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE OF COMMAND OVER HERSELF
THERE IS GREAT TRUTH HOWEVER IN WHAT YOU HAVE NOW URGED OF THE ALLOWANCES WHICH OUGHT TO BE MADE FOR HIM AND IT IS MY WISH TO BE CANDID IN MY JUDGMENT OF EVERY BODY WILLOUGHBY MAY UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE VERY SUFFICIENT REASONS FOR HIS CONDUCT
AND IT SEEMED AS IF HER TEARS WERE EVEN THEN RESTRAINED WITH DIFFICULTY SHE AVOIDED THE LOOKS OF THEM ALL COULD NEITHER EAT NOR SPEAK AND AFTER SOME TIME ON HER MOTHER'S SILENTLY PRESSING HER HAND WITH TENDER COMPASSION HER SMALL DEGREE OF FORTITUDE
AND ABSENT HIMSELF FROM DEVONSHIRE FOR A WHILE YOU WILL TELL ME I KNOW THAT THIS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED BUT I WILL LISTEN TO NO CAVIL UNLESS YOU CAN POINT OUT ANY OTHER METHOD OF UNDERSTANDING THE AFFAIR AS SATISFACTORY AT THIS
WHILE VINDICATING HIMSELF TO SAY NOTHING UNKIND OF THE OTHERS BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMONGST THEM WHOSE CONDUCT HE COULD MENTION WITHOUT SOME NECESSITY OF DEFENCE OR PALLIATION WE HAVE ALL BEEN MORE OR LESS TO BLAME SAID HE
AFTER THE HOUSE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF EVERY OBJECT ENFORCING THE REMEMBRANCE AND RESTORED TO ITS PROPER STATE HE DID NOT ENTER INTO ANY REMONSTRANCE WITH HIS OTHER CHILDREN HE WAS MORE WILLING TO BELIEVE THEY FELT THEIR ERROR THAN TO RUN THE RISK OF INVESTIGATION
HE HAD TO REINSTATE HIMSELF IN ALL THE WONTED CONCERNS OF HIS MANSFIELD LIFE TO SEE HIS STEWARD AND HIS BAILIFF TO EXAMINE AND COMPUTE AND IN THE INTERVALS OF BUSINESS TO WALK INTO HIS STABLES AND HIS GARDENS AND NEAREST PLANTATIONS
BUT ALL THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY SUCH A SITUATION OF HIS AFFAIRS AS YOU HAVE SUPPOSED HE HAD JUST PARTED FROM MY SISTER HAD SEEN HER LEAVE HIM IN THE GREATEST AFFLICTION AND IF HE FELT OBLIGED FROM A FEAR OF OFFENDING MISSUS SMITH
AND THEY MAY SOON BE ENTIRELY DONE AWAY IF WE FIND THEY CORRESPOND EVERY FEAR OF MINE WILL BE REMOVED A MIGHTY CONCESSION INDEED IF YOU WERE TO SEE THEM AT THE ALTAR
HE COLOURED AS HE REPLIED YOU ARE VERY KIND BUT I HAVE NO IDEA OF RETURNING INTO DEVONSHIRE IMMEDIATELY MY VISITS TO MISSUS SMITH ARE NEVER REPEATED WITHIN THE TWELVEMONTH
SIR THOMAS HAD BEEN QUITE INDIFFERENT TO MISTER CRAWFORD'S GOING OR STAYING
OF LOVERS VOWS IN THE HOUSE FOR HE WAS BURNING ALL THAT MET HIS EYE MISTER YATES WAS BEGINNING NOW TO UNDERSTAND SIR THOMAS'S INTENTIONS THOUGH AS FAR AS EVER FROM UNDERSTANDING THEIR SOURCE HE AND HIS FRIEND HAD BEEN OUT WITH THEIR GUNS THE CHIEF OF THE MORNING
SINCE AUGUST BEGAN WITHOUT BRINGING THEM TOGETHER IN SOME WAY OR OTHER IT WAS A SAD ANXIOUS DAY AND THE MORROW THOUGH DIFFERING IN THE SORT OF EVIL DID BY NO MEANS BRING LESS A FEW MOMENTS OF FEVERISH ENJOYMENT WERE FOLLOWED BY HOURS OF ACUTE SUFFERING
I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS THINK THE ACQUAINTANCE WORTH ANY TROUBLE THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN TO ESTABLISH IT THERE IS NOTHING VERY STRIKING IN MISTER RUSHWORTH'S MANNERS BUT I WAS PLEASED LAST NIGHT WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE HIS OPINION ON ONE SUBJECT
BUT ACTIVE AND METHODICAL HE HAD NOT ONLY DONE ALL THIS BEFORE HE RESUMED HIS SEAT AS MASTER OF THE HOUSE AT DINNER
FEEL HIS MOTIVES TO DESERVE AND ACKNOWLEDGING WITH PERFECT INGENUOUSNESS THAT HIS CONCESSION HAD BEEN ATTENDED WITH SUCH PARTIAL GOOD AS TO MAKE HIS JUDGMENT IN IT VERY DOUBTFUL HE WAS ANXIOUS
SUCH CARELESSNESS OF THE FUTURE AS YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM YOU MUST REMEMBER MY DEAR MOTHER THAT I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THIS MATTER AS CERTAIN I HAVE HAD MY DOUBTS I CONFESS BUT THEY ARE FAINTER THAN THEY WERE
AND THERE WERE GIRLS ENOUGH ON THE CATCH FOR HIM IF WE HAD BEEN IDLE BUT I LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED I WAS READY TO MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO PERSUADE MY SISTER AND AT LAST I DID PERSUADE HER YOU KNOW THE DISTANCE TO SOTHERTON
AND EVEN SECRECY AS FAR AS IT CAN BE OBSERVED MAY NOW BE VERY ADVISABLE THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE ENTRANCE OF MARGARET AND ELINOR WAS THEN AT LIBERTY TO THINK OVER THE REPRESENTATIONS OF HER MOTHER
WILLOUGHBY'S BEHAVIOUR IN TAKING LEAVE OF THEM HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND AFFECTATION OF CHEERFULNESS AND ABOVE ALL HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT HER MOTHER'S INVITATION A BACKWARDNESS SO UNLIKE A LOVER SO UNLIKE HIMSELF GREATLY DISTURBED HER
MISSUS DASHWOOD'S VISIT TO LADY MIDDLETON TOOK PLACE THE NEXT DAY AND TWO OF HER DAUGHTERS WENT WITH HER BUT MARIANNE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM BEING OF THE PARTY UNDER SOME TRIFLING PRETEXT OF EMPLOYMENT
AND SO ENDED ALL THE HOPES HIS SELFISH VANITY HAD RAISED IN MARIA AND JULIA BERTRAM JULIA COULD REJOICE THAT HE WAS GONE HIS PRESENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BE ODIOUS TO HER AND IF MARIA GAINED HIM NOT
AND IS NO ALLOWANCE TO BE MADE FOR INADVERTENCE OR FOR SPIRITS DEPRESSED BY RECENT DISAPPOINTMENT
DO YOU SUPPOSE HIM REALLY INDIFFERENT TO HER NO I CANNOT THINK THAT HE MUST AND DOES LOVE HER I AM SURE BUT WITH A STRANGE KIND OF TENDERNESS IF HE CAN LEAVE HER WITH SUCH INDIFFERENCE
AND I WILL HOPE THAT HE HAS BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE WILLOUGHBY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AT ONCE SECRECY MAY BE ADVISABLE BUT STILL I CANNOT HELP WONDERING AT ITS BEING PRACTICED BY HIM
HE WAS GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY BEING TO MEET HIS UNCLE AT BATH WITHOUT DELAY BUT IF THERE WERE ANY PROSPECT OF A RENEWAL OF LOVERS VOWS HE SHOULD HOLD HIMSELF POSITIVELY ENGAGED HE SHOULD BREAK THROUGH EVERY OTHER CLAIM
PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE HAS OTHER VIEWS FOR HIM AND ON THAT ACCOUNT IS EAGER TO GET HIM AWAY AND THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH SHE SENDS HIM OFF TO TRANSACT IS INVENTED AS AN EXCUSE TO DISMISS HIM
IF MISTER RUSHWORTH WERE A SON OF YOUR OWN HE COULD NOT HOLD SIR THOMAS IN GREATER RESPECT SIR THOMAS GAVE UP THE POINT FOILED BY HER EVASIONS DISARMED BY HER FLATTERY AND WAS OBLIGED TO REST SATISFIED WITH THE CONVICTION
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ODD THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE US WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING EVERYTHING TO ME AT ONCE BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT IN SOME RESPECTS NOT PROSPEROUSLY BEGUN FOR THEIR MARRIAGE MUST BE AT A VERY UNCERTAIN DISTANCE
THE DISTRESS IN WHICH MARIANNE HAD QUITTED THE ROOM WAS SUCH AS A SERIOUS QUARREL COULD MOST REASONABLY ACCOUNT FOR THOUGH WHEN SHE CONSIDERED WHAT MARIANNE'S LOVE FOR HIM WAS A QUARREL SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
HE DID NOT SPEAK HE DID NOT BEHAVE LIKE HIMSELF YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THE DIFFERENCE AS WELL AS I WHAT CAN IT BE CAN THEY HAVE QUARRELLED WHY ELSE SHOULD HE HAVE SHEWN SUCH UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION HERE
IT IS ABOUT MY UNCLE'S USUAL TIME WHEN DO YOU THINK OF GOING I MAY PERHAPS GET AS FAR AS BANBURY TO DAY WHOSE STABLES DO YOU USE AT BATH WAS THE NEXT QUESTION
AND AM THE MORE CONCERNED THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MY DEAR SIR THOMAS IF YOU HAD SEEN THE STATE OF THE ROADS THAT DAY I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOT THROUGH THEM THOUGH WE HAD THE FOUR HORSES OF COURSE
TO LADY BERTRAM AND EDMUND TO DETAIL WHEREBY A MOST CONSIDERABLE SAVING HAD ALWAYS ARISEN AND MORE THAN ONE BAD SERVANT BEEN DETECTED BUT HER CHIEF STRENGTH LAY IN SOTHERTON HER GREATEST SUPPORT AND GLORY
BUT FOR HIS CHILDREN'S SAKE AND HE MIGHT BE THANKFUL TO HIS FAIR DAUGHTER JULIA THAT MISTER YATES DID YET MEAN TO STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER UNDER HIS ROOF THE EVENING PASSED WITH EXTERNAL SMOOTHNESS THOUGH ALMOST EVERY MIND WAS RUFFLED
WHAT HAD BEEN SO LATELY PUT UP IN THE BILLIARD ROOM AND GIVEN THE SCENE PAINTER HIS DISMISSAL LONG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE PLEASING BELIEF OF HIS BEING THEN AT LEAST AS FAR OFF AS NORTHAMPTON THE SCENE PAINTER WAS GONE HAVING SPOILT ONLY THE FLOOR OF ONE ROOM
AS A DIFFERENCE IN JUDGMENT FROM MYSELF OR A DEVIATION FROM WHAT I MAY THINK RIGHT AND CONSISTENT YOU SPEAK VERY PROPERLY WILLOUGHBY CERTAINLY DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE SUSPECTED
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF A BETTER DECISION THEMSELVES BUT THEY WERE YOUNG
THAT EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE EXCEPT ONE IS IN FAVOUR OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT BUT THAT ONE IS THE TOTAL SILENCE OF BOTH ON THE SUBJECT AND WITH ME IT ALMOST OUTWEIGHS EVERY OTHER HOW STRANGE THIS IS
MY ENGAGEMENTS AT PRESENT REPLIED WILLOUGHBY CONFUSEDLY ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT I DARE NOT FLATTER MYSELF HE STOPT MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS TOO MUCH ASTONISHED TO SPEAK
I HOPE NOT I BELIEVE NOT CRIED ELINOR I LOVE WILLOUGHBY SINCERELY LOVE HIM AND SUSPICION OF HIS INTEGRITY CANNOT BE MORE PAINFUL TO YOURSELF THAN TO ME IT HAS BEEN INVOLUNTARY
EVERY ONE OF US EXCEPTING FANNY FANNY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS JUDGED RIGHTLY THROUGHOUT WHO HAS BEEN CONSISTENT HER FEELINGS HAVE BEEN STEADILY AGAINST IT FROM FIRST TO LAST SHE NEVER CEASED TO THINK OF WHAT WAS DUE TO YOU
SHE WAS NOW COOL ENOUGH TO DISPENSE WITH ANY OTHER REVENGE SHE DID NOT WANT EXPOSURE TO BE ADDED TO DESERTION HENRY CRAWFORD GONE SHE COULD EVEN PITY HER SISTER
WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HER REMAINING AT HOME ON THEIR RETURN FROM THE PARK THEY FOUND WILLOUGHBY'S CURRICLE AND SERVANT IN WAITING AT THE COTTAGE AND MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS CONVINCED THAT HER CONJECTURE HAD BEEN JUST
SO FAR IT WAS ALL AS SHE HAD FORESEEN BUT ON ENTERING THE HOUSE SHE BEHELD WHAT NO FORESIGHT HAD TAUGHT HER TO EXPECT THEY WERE NO SOONER IN THE PASSAGE THAN MARIANNE CAME HASTILY OUT OF THE PARLOUR APPARENTLY IN VIOLENT AFFLICTION
I CAN HARDLY TELL MYSELF BUT SUSPICION OF SOMETHING UNPLEASANT IS THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AN ALTERATION AS WE JUST WITNESSED IN HIM
WITH GREATER SURPRISE THEREFORE HE MUST REGARD HER ACQUIESCENCE IN THEIR WRONG MEASURES HER COUNTENANCE OF THEIR UNSAFE AMUSEMENTS THAN THAT SUCH MEASURES AND SUCH AMUSEMENTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED
HENRY CRAWFORD WAS AGAIN IN THE HOUSE HE WALKED UP WITH DOCTOR GRANT WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO SIR THOMAS AND AT RATHER AN EARLY HOUR THEY WERE USHERED INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE WERE MOST OF THE FAMILY SIR THOMAS SOON APPEARED
AND HER MOTHER WHO CONCLUDED THAT A PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE BY WILLOUGHBY THE NIGHT BEFORE OF CALLING ON HER
THE REPROOF OF AN IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION OF EVERYTHING THE SWEEP OF EVERY PREPARATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENT THERE WAS ONE PERSON HOWEVER IN THE HOUSE WHOM HE COULD NOT LEAVE TO LEARN HIS SENTIMENTS MERELY THROUGH HIS CONDUCT
THEY SAW HIM STEP INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND IN A MINUTE IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT MISSUS DASHWOOD FELT TOO MUCH FOR SPEECH AND INSTANTLY QUITTED THE PARLOUR TO GIVE WAY IN SOLITUDE TO THE CONCERN AND ALARM
AND I CAN PERFECTLY ACCOUNT FOR EVERY THING THAT AT FIRST SEEMED STRANGE TO ME AS WELL AS TO YOU CAN YOU INDEED YES
MY HEAD STILL ACHED AND BLED WITH THE BLOW AND FALL I HAD RECEIVED NO ONE HAD REPROVED JOHN FOR WANTONLY STRIKING ME AND BECAUSE I HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM TO AVERT FARTHER IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE
BUT THE MOTHER'S HEART TURNED FROM AN OPINION SO HARSH
AND WHAT A SCREAM
THEIR TWO PAIR OF HANDS ARRESTED ME INSTANTLY IF YOU DON'T SIT STILL YOU MUST BE TIED DOWN SAID BESSIE
A BED SUPPORTED ON MASSIVE PILLARS OF MAHOGANY
THE PILED UP MATTRESSES AND PILLOWS OF THE BED
EVEN IF YOU WAS BROUGHT UP IN TORONTO I S'POSE YOU THINK A HIRED BOY HASN'T ANY BUSINESS TO PRAY FOR PARTICULAR THINGS BUT I'LL SHOW YOU I'LL JUST PRAY FOR WHAT I PLEASE AND I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY AND STOP ME
AN HONOUR IS AWARDED WHERE IT IS NOT MERITED AND CONSEQUENTLY DENIED WHERE IT IS JUSTLY DUE
AFTER THAT NO MORAL FORCE ON EARTH COULD HAVE PREVENTED FELIX FROM FIGHTING HE WOULD HAVE FACED AN ARMY WITH BANNERS YOU MIGHT SETTLE IT BY DRAWING LOTS SAID CECILY DESPERATELY DRAWING LOTS IS WICKEDER THAT FIGHTING SAID DAN
CONVENTIONALITY IS NOT MORALITY SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS IS NOT RELIGION TO ATTACK THE FIRST IS NOT TO ASSAIL THE LAST TO PLUCK THE MASK FROM THE FACE OF THE PHARISEE IS NOT TO LIFT AN IMPIOUS HAND TO THE CROWN OF THORNS
HER POTENT VOICE MADE ME FEEL THAT I WAS QUITE A HERO AFTER ALL AND THE STING WENT OUT OF MY RECOLLECTION OF THAT OLD FIGHT WHEN WE ARRIVED BEHIND THE GRANARY THE OTHERS WERE ALL THERE
AT INTERVALS WHILE TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF MY BOOK I STUDIED THE ASPECT OF THAT WINTER AFTERNOON AFAR IT OFFERED A PALE BLANK OF MIST AND CLOUD NEAR A SCENE OF WET LAWN AND STORM BEAT SHRUB WITH CEASELESS RAIN
ROGER IS LOOKING FOR YOU TO WASH HIS BUGGY BE OFF
I DWELT ON IT WITH GATHERING DREAD I COULD NOT REMEMBER HIM BUT I KNEW THAT HE WAS MY OWN UNCLE
MISSUS REED IMPATIENT OF MY NOW FRANTIC ANGUISH AND WILD SOBS ABRUPTLY THRUST ME BACK AND LOCKED ME IN WITHOUT FARTHER PARLEY I HEARD HER SWEEPING AWAY AND SOON AFTER SHE WAS GONE I SUPPOSE I HAD A SPECIES OF FIT
HE CONTRIVED TO EAT A BITTER APPLE WITHOUT A GRIMACE UNTIL HE CAME TO THE LAST BITE WHICH PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM BUT FELIX WAS VASTLY ENCOURAGED
BESSIE ANSWERED NOT BUT ERE LONG ADDRESSING ME SHE SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE AWARE MISS THAT YOU ARE UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO MISSUS REED SHE KEEPS YOU
CECILY KEEP QUIET NOW ONE TWO THREE PETER AND FELIX PITCHED IN WITH MORE ZEAL THAN DISCRETION ON BOTH SIDES AS A RESULT PETER GOT WHAT LATER DEVELOPED INTO A BLACK EYE AND FELIX'S NOSE BEGAN TO BLEED
I SAY CORDIALLY GENTLEMEN I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART
DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO FORSAKE THE RED ROOM IT WAS PAST FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE BECLOUDED AFTERNOON WAS TENDING TO DREAR TWILIGHT I HEARD THE RAIN STILL BEATING CONTINUOUSLY ON THE STAIRCASE WINDOW AND THE WIND HOWLING IN THE GROVE BEHIND THE HALL
PLEADED BESSIE LET HER GO WAS THE ONLY ANSWER LOOSE BESSIE'S HAND CHILD YOU CANNOT SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT BY THESE MEANS BE ASSURED I ABHOR ARTIFICE PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN
I REALIZED HOW DEEPLY HE FELT ON THE SUBJECT AND HOPED HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL FELIX PRAYED EARNESTLY THAT HE MIGHT BE ENABLED TO EAT A BITTER APPLE WITHOUT MAKING A FACE AND WHEN HE HAD PRAYED THREE NIGHTS AFTER THIS MANNER
VERY PAINFUL AND CRUSHING BUT ONLY HALF INTELLIGIBLE MISS ABBOT JOINED IN
NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
SAID FELIX THE GIRLS GASPED BUT DAN AND I WERE JUBILANT SNUFFING BATTLE AFAR OFF ALL RIGHT I CAN FIGHT AS WELL AS PRAY OH DON'T FIGHT IMPLORED CECILY I THINK IT WOULD BE DREADFUL
ALL SAID I WAS WICKED AND PERHAPS I MIGHT BE SO
AND GAVE SIGNIFICANCE TO THE ROCK STANDING UP ALONE IN A SEA OF BILLOW AND SPRAY TO THE BROKEN BOAT STRANDED ON A DESOLATE COAST
FELIX MARCHED OVER TO UNCLE ROGER'S AND WE TRAILED AFTER SCENTING A SCENE WE FOUND PETER SHELLING BEANS IN THE GRANARY AND WHISTLING CHEERILY AS WITH A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENCE TOWARDS ALL MEN LOOK HERE PETER
AND FOR THE LOOK YOU HAD IN YOUR EYES TWO MINUTES SINCE YOU RAT
DID SHE SAY THAT TO ME DID YOU HEAR HER ELIZA AND GEORGIANA WON'T I TELL MAMA BUT FIRST HE RAN HEADLONG AT ME I FELT HIM GRASP MY HAIR AND MY SHOULDER HE HAD CLOSED WITH A DESPERATE THING
HE HAD NOT FELT VERY KEENLY OVER THE MATTER OF THE SERMONS AND CERTAINLY THE MERE FACT THAT PETER COULD EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT MAKING FACES DID NOT CAST ANY REFLECTION ON THE HONOUR OR ABILITY OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS
WAS UNIVERSALLY INDULGED HER BEAUTY HER PINK CHEEKS AND GOLDEN CURLS SEEMED TO GIVE DELIGHT TO ALL WHO LOOKED AT HER AND TO PURCHASE INDEMNITY FOR EVERY FAULT JOHN NO ONE THWARTED MUCH LESS PUNISHED
BUT CONTINUALLY EVERY NERVE I HAD FEARED HIM AND EVERY MORSEL OF FLESH IN MY BONES SHRANK WHEN HE CAME NEAR THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I WAS BEWILDERED BY THE TERROR HE INSPIRED
I MAY BE MISTAKEN BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THE STORY GIRL WANTED THAT FIGHT STOPPED
DID YOU EVER FIGHT ASKED THE STORY GIRL ONCE I SAID BRIEFLY DREADING THE NEXT QUESTION WHICH PROMPTLY CAME WHO BEAT IT IS SOMETIMES A BITTER THING TO TELL THE TRUTH
OF HIM WHO WOULD PRESENTLY DEAL IT
AND FELT SORE WHENEVER I THOUGHT OF MY FAILURE BUT I HAD NO BURNING DESIRE TO EAT SOUR APPLES WITHOUT GRIMACING AND I DID NOT SYMPATHIZE OVER AND ABOVE WITH MY BROTHER WHEN HOWEVER HE TOOK TO PRAYING ABOUT IT
BE SEATED SOMEWHERE AND UNTIL YOU CAN SPEAK PLEASANTLY REMAIN SILENT A BREAKFAST ROOM ADJOINED THE DRAWING ROOM I SLIPPED IN THERE IT CONTAINED A BOOKCASE I SOON POSSESSED MYSELF OF A VOLUME
IF ANYTHING COULD HAVE MADE HIM THIN THE WAY HE WORRIED OVER THIS MATTER WOULD HAVE DONE IT FOR MYSELF I CARED NOT A GROAT
I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE WOULD SAY HE RETORTED FELICITY TRIED ANOTHER TACK YOU'LL BE SURE TO GET WHIPPED IF YOU FIGHT WITH PETER SHE SAID YOU'RE TOO FAT TO FIGHT
SCARCELY LESS PROMINENT WAS AN AMPLE CUSHIONED EASY CHAIR NEAR THE HEAD OF THE BED ALSO WHITE WITH A FOOTSTOOL BEFORE IT AND LOOKING AS I THOUGHT LIKE A PALE THRONE THIS ROOM WAS CHILL BECAUSE IT SELDOM HAD A FIRE
STOOD OUT LIKE A TABERNACLE IN THE CENTRE THE TWO LARGE WINDOWS WITH THEIR BLINDS ALWAYS DRAWN DOWN WERE HALF SHROUDED IN FESTOONS AND FALLS OF SIMILAR DRAPERY THE CARPET WAS RED THE TABLE AT THE FOOT OF THE BED WAS COVERED WITH A CRIMSON CLOTH
AND THEN MY COURAGE SANK MY HABITUAL MOOD OF HUMILIATION SELF DOUBT
AND THITHER WE ALL RESORTED AT SUNSET I HOPE FELIX WILL BEAT SAID THE STORY GIRL TO ME NOT ONLY FOR THE FAMILY HONOUR BUT BECAUSE THAT WAS A MEAN MEAN PRAYER OF PETER'S DO YOU THINK HE WILL I DON'T KNOW
I GUESS YOU MEAN PRINCIPLE I SUGGESTED YES THAT'S IT AGREED PETER IT'S ALL RIGHT TO FIGHT FOR PRINCIPLE IT'S KIND OF PRAYING WITH YOUR FISTS OH CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING TO PREVENT THEM FROM FIGHTING SARA
ADDED BESSIE IN NO HARSH VOICE YOU SHOULD TRY TO BE USEFUL AND PLEASANT THEN PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE A HOME HERE BUT IF YOU BECOME PASSIONATE AND RUDE MISSIS WILL SEND YOU AWAY I AM SURE BESIDES SAID MISS ABBOT
PERSISTED CECILY GOOD PRESBYTERIANS DON'T FIGHT OH DON'T THEY I HEARD YOUR UNCLE ROGER SAY THAT PRESBYTERIANS WERE THE BEST FOR FIGHTING IN THE WORLD OR THE WORST I FORGET WHICH HE SAID BUT IT MEANS THE SAME THING
CECILY WAS VERY PALE AND FELIX AND PETER WERE TAKING OFF THEIR COATS THERE WAS A PURE YELLOW SUNSET THAT EVENING
WHAT DOES BESSIE SAY I HAVE DONE I ASKED JANE I DON'T LIKE CAVILLERS OR QUESTIONERS BESIDES THERE IS SOMETHING TRULY FORBIDDING IN A CHILD TAKING UP HER ELDERS IN THAT MANNER
WHEN SHE CHANCED TO BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AND WHEN HAVING BROUGHT HER IRONING TABLE TO THE NURSERY HEARTH SHE ALLOWED US TO SIT ABOUT IT AND WHILE SHE GOT UP MISSUS REED'S LACE FRILLS AND CRIMPED HER NIGHTCAP BORDERS
A NOXIOUS THING CHERISHING THE GERMS OF INDIGNATION AT THEIR TREATMENT OF CONTEMPT OF THEIR JUDGMENT I KNOW THAT HAD I BEEN A SANGUINE BRILLIANT CARELESS EXACTING HANDSOME ROMPING CHILD THOUGH EQUALLY DEPENDENT AND FRIENDLESS
NOR COULD I PASS UNNOTICED THE SUGGESTION OF THE BLEAK SHORES OF LAPLAND SIBERIA SPITZBERGEN NOVA ZEMBLA ICELAND GREENLAND WITH THE VAST SWEEP OF THE ARCTIC ZONE AND THOSE FORLORN REGIONS OF DREARY SPACE
IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE REMOTE FROM THE NURSERY AND KITCHEN SOLEMN BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN TO BE SO SELDOM ENTERED THE HOUSE MAID ALONE CAME HERE ON SATURDAYS TO WIPE FROM THE MIRRORS AND THE FURNITURE A WEEK'S QUIET DUST
I WAS LOADED WITH GENERAL OPPROBRIUM UNJUST UNJUST SAID MY REASON FORCED BY THE AGONISING STIMULUS INTO PRECOCIOUS THOUGH TRANSITORY POWER AND RESOLVE EQUALLY WROUGHT UP
NOW I'LL TEACH YOU TO RUMMAGE MY BOOKSHELVES FOR THEY ARE MINE ALL THE HOUSE BELONGS TO ME OR WILL DO IN A FEW YEARS
CECILY GAVE A SHRIEK AND RAN OUT OF THE WOOD WE THOUGHT SHE HAD FLED BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD AND WE WERE NOT SORRY FOR HER MANIFEST DISAPPROVAL AND ANXIETY WERE DAMPING THE EXCITEMENT OF THE OCCASION
IT IS MY DUTY TO SHOW YOU THAT TRICKS WILL NOT ANSWER YOU WILL NOW STAY HERE AN HOUR LONGER AND IT IS ONLY ON CONDITION OF PERFECT SUBMISSION AND STILLNESS THAT I SHALL LIBERATE YOU THEN O AUNT HAVE PITY
HE TOLD FELICITY AND FELICITY TOLD ME SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT IT WAS REAL CUTE OF HIM I THINK THAT IS A DREADFUL WAY TO TALK ABOUT PRAYING AND I TOLD HER SO
CRIED THE LADY'S MAID WHAT SHOCKING CONDUCT MISS EYRE TO STRIKE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN YOUR BENEFACTRESS'S SON YOUR YOUNG MASTER MASTER HOW IS HE MY MASTER AM I A SERVANT
AND IN THOSE LAST WORDS LIES THE SECRET OF THE RED ROOM THE SPELL WHICH KEPT IT SO LONELY IN SPITE OF ITS GRANDEUR MISTER REED HAD BEEN DEAD NINE YEARS IT WAS IN THIS CHAMBER HE BREATHED HIS LAST
WHOSE EARS DETECT IN EACH PROTEST AGAINST BIGOTRY THAT PARENT OF CRIME AN INSULT TO PIETY THAT REGENT OF GOD ON EARTH I WOULD SUGGEST TO SUCH DOUBTERS CERTAIN OBVIOUS DISTINCTIONS
BESSIE AND ABBOT ENTERED MISS EYRE ARE YOU ILL SAID BESSIE
AND COULD DISCOVER BY HER OWN OBSERVATION THAT I WAS ENDEAVOURING IN GOOD EARNEST TO ACQUIRE A MORE SOCIABLE AND CHILDLIKE DISPOSITION A MORE ATTRACTIVE AND SPRIGHTLY MANNER SOMETHING LIGHTER FRANKER MORE NATURAL AS IT WERE
I REALLY SAW IN HIM A TYRANT A MURDERER I FELT A DROP OR TWO OF BLOOD FROM MY HEAD TRICKLE DOWN MY NECK AND WAS SENSIBLE OF SOMEWHAT PUNGENT SUFFERING THESE SENSATIONS FOR THE TIME PREDOMINATED OVER FEAR AND I RECEIVED HIM IN FRANTIC SORT
I MIGHT SAY NEVER INDEED UNLESS WHEN A CHANCE INFLUX OF VISITORS AT GATESHEAD HALL RENDERED IT NECESSARY TO TURN TO ACCOUNT ALL THE ACCOMMODATION IT CONTAINED YET IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND STATELIEST CHAMBERS IN THE MANSION
I HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO THESE WORDS THEY WERE NOT NEW TO ME MY VERY FIRST RECOLLECTIONS OF EXISTENCE INCLUDED HINTS OF THE SAME KIND THIS REPROACH OF MY DEPENDENCE HAD BECOME A VAGUE SING SONG IN MY EAR
THE WARDROBE THE TOILET TABLE THE CHAIRS WERE OF DARKLY POLISHED OLD MAHOGANY
HE STRUCK SUDDENLY AND STRONGLY I TOTTERED AND ON REGAINING MY EQUILIBRIUM RETIRED BACK A STEP OR TWO FROM HIS CHAIR
EACH PICTURE TOLD A STORY MYSTERIOUS OFTEN TO MY UNDEVELOPED UNDERSTANDING AND IMPERFECT FEELINGS YET EVER PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING AS INTERESTING AS THE TALES BESSIE SOMETIMES NARRATED ON WINTER EVENINGS
SOMETHING BAD MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND FETCH YOU AWAY THEY WENT SHUTTING THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT BEHIND THEM THE RED ROOM WAS A SQUARE CHAMBER VERY SELDOM SLEPT IN
AND WHEN I DARED MOVE I GOT UP AND WENT TO SEE ALAS YES NO JAIL WAS EVER MORE SECURE RETURNING I HAD TO CROSS BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS MY FASCINATED GLANCE INVOLUNTARILY EXPLORED THE DEPTH IT REVEALED
FORGIVE ME I CANNOT ENDURE IT LET ME BE PUNISHED SOME OTHER WAY I SHALL BE KILLED IF SILENCE
WITH SUBDUED BROKEN REFLECTIONS VARYING THE GLOSS OF ITS PANELS TO MY LEFT WERE THE MUFFLED WINDOWS A GREAT LOOKING GLASS BETWEEN THEM REPEATED THE VACANT MAJESTY OF THE BED AND ROOM I WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THEY HAD LOCKED THE DOOR
ALL LOOKED COLDER AND DARKER IN THAT VISIONARY HOLLOW THAN IN REALITY AND THE STRANGE LITTLE FIGURE THERE GAZING AT ME WITH A WHITE FACE AND ARMS SPECKING THE GLOOM
CHAPTER TWO I RESISTED ALL THE WAY A NEW THING FOR ME AND A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GREATLY STRENGTHENED THE BAD OPINION BESSIE AND MISS ABBOT WERE DISPOSED TO ENTERTAIN OF ME THE FACT IS I WAS A TRIFLE BESIDE MYSELF
PLEADED CECILY TURNING TO THE STORY GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A BIN SWINGING HER SHAPELY BARE FEET TO AND FRO IT DOESN'T DO TO MEDDLE IN AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND BETWEEN BOYS SAID THE STORY GIRL SAGELY
IT WAS ULTIMATELY ARRANGED THAT THE COMBAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE FIR WOOD BEHIND UNCLE ROGER'S GRANARY IT WAS A NICE REMOTE BOSKY PLACE WHERE NO PROWLING GROWN UP WOULD BE LIKELY TO INTRUDE
AND PERHAPS TO PINING AFTER HOME JOHN HAD NOT MUCH AFFECTION FOR HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AN ANTIPATHY TO ME HE BULLIED AND PUNISHED ME NOT TWO OR THREE TIMES IN THE WEEK
ALSO I HAD DRAWN PARALLELS IN SILENCE WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT THUS TO HAVE DECLARED ALOUD
NOT SOON ENOUGH HOWEVER THE VOLUME WAS FLUNG IT HIT ME AND I FELL STRIKING MY HEAD AGAINST THE DOOR AND CUTTING IT THE CUT BLED THE PAIN WAS SHARP MY TERROR HAD PASSED ITS CLIMAX OTHER FEELINGS SUCCEEDED
MY HEAD GREW HOT A SOUND FILLED MY EARS WHICH I DEEMED THE RUSHING OF WINGS SOMETHING SEEMED NEAR ME I WAS OPPRESSED SUFFOCATED ENDURANCE BROKE DOWN I RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND SHOOK THE LOCK IN DESPERATE EFFORT
THE TWO SHIPS BECALMED ON A TORPID SEA I BELIEVED TO BE MARINE PHANTOMS
A COOL AUTUMNAL WIND WAS WHISTLING AMONG THE DARK BOUGHS AND SCATTERING BLOOD RED LEAVES FROM THE MAPLE AT THE END OF THE GRANARY NOW SAID DAN I'LL COUNT
HE CALLED HIS MOTHER OLD GIRL TOO SOMETIMES REVILED HER FOR HER DARK SKIN SIMILAR TO HIS OWN BLUNTLY DISREGARDED HER WISHES NOT UNFREQUENTLY TORE AND SPOILED HER SILK ATTIRE
IT ISN'T FAIR OH FELIX DON'T TALK LIKE THAT SAID CECILY SHOCKED GOD MUST BE FAIR I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE REASON PETER PRAYS THREE TIMES A DAY REGULAR
I MOUNTED INTO THE WINDOW SEAT GATHERING UP MY FEET I SAT CROSS LEGGED LIKE A TURK AND HAVING DRAWN THE RED MOREEN CURTAIN NEARLY CLOSE I WAS SHRINED IN DOUBLE RETIREMENT
I BEGAN TO RECALL WHAT I HAD HEARD OF DEAD MEN TROUBLED IN THEIR GRAVES BY THE VIOLATION OF THEIR LAST WISHES REVISITING THE EARTH TO PUNISH THE PERJURED AND AVENGE THE OPPRESSED
UNCLE ALEC WALKED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE GRANARY WITH CECILY BEHIND HIM HE WAS NOT ANGRY THERE WAS A QUIZZICAL LOOK IN HIS EYES BUT HE TOOK THE COMBATANTS BY THEIR SHIRT COLLARS AND DRAGGED THEM APART THIS STOPS RIGHT HERE BOYS
I FEARED NOTHING BUT INTERRUPTION AND THAT CAME TOO SOON
BUT HATE AS IT WILL IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AHAB DID NOT LIKE MICAIAH BECAUSE HE NEVER PROPHESIED GOOD CONCERNING HIM BUT EVIL
YOU ARE A DEPENDENT MAMA SAYS YOU HAVE NO MONEY YOUR FATHER LEFT YOU NONE YOU OUGHT TO BEG AND NOT TO LIVE HERE WITH GENTLEMEN'S CHILDREN LIKE US AND EAT THE SAME MEALS WE DO
A SINGULAR NOTION DAWNED UPON ME I DOUBTED NOT NEVER DOUBTED THAT IF MISTER REED HAD BEEN ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE TREATED ME KINDLY
AS RUNNING AWAY OR IF THAT COULD NOT BE EFFECTED NEVER EATING OR DRINKING MORE AND LETTING MYSELF DIE WHAT A CONSTERNATION OF SOUL WAS MINE THAT DREARY AFTERNOON
ALL HIS MOTHER'S AVERSION ALL THE SERVANTS PARTIALITY TURNED UP IN MY DISTURBED MIND LIKE A DARK DEPOSIT IN A TURBID WELL WHY WAS I ALWAYS SUFFERING ALWAYS BROWBEATEN
SAID FELIX OMINOUSLY THEY TELL ME THAT YOU'VE BEEN PRAYING RIGHT ALONG THAT I COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE NOW I TELL YOU
ELIZA WHO WAS HEADSTRONG AND SELFISH WAS RESPECTED GEORGIANA WHO HAD A SPOILED TEMPER A VERY ACRID SPITE
IN THE MORNING AND AT DINNER TIME AND AT NIGHT AND BESIDES THAT ANY TIME THROUGH THE DAY WHEN HE HAPPENS TO THINK OF IT HE JUST PRAYS STANDING UP DID YOU EVER HEAR OF SUCH GOINGS ON WELL
AND APPEARING BEFORE THE EYES OF BELATED TRAVELLERS I RETURNED TO MY STOOL SUPERSTITION WAS WITH ME AT THAT MOMENT BUT IT WAS NOT YET HER HOUR FOR COMPLETE VICTORY MY BLOOD WAS STILL WARM
THE OTHER FELLOW I SAID WITH RELUCTANT HONESTY WELL SAID THE STORY GIRL I THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU GET WHIPPED OR NOT SO LONG AS YOU FIGHT A GOOD SQUARE FIGHT
ALWAYS ACCUSED FOR EVER CONDEMNED WHY COULD I NEVER PLEASE
OH I SAW A LIGHT AND I THOUGHT A GHOST WOULD COME I HAD NOW GOT HOLD OF BESSIE'S HAND AND SHE DID NOT SNATCH IT FROM ME
THAT RESERVOIR OF FROST AND SNOW WHERE FIRM FIELDS OF ICE THE ACCUMULATION OF CENTURIES OF WINTERS
I NEVER MENTIONED YOUR NAME I NEVER PRAYED THAT YOU COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE I JUST PRAYED THAT I'D BE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD WELL THAT'S THE SAME THING CRIED FELIX YOU'VE JUST BEEN PRAYING FOR THE OPPOSITE TO ME OUT OF SPITE
AND HUMBLED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY PHYSICAL INFERIORITY TO ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA REED THE SAID ELIZA JOHN AND GEORGIANA WERE NOW CLUSTERED ROUND THEIR MAMA IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE LAY RECLINED ON A SOFA BY THE FIRESIDE
HE'S GOT TO STOP PRAYING AGAINST ME ANYHOW SAID FELIX RESOLUTELY
THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF TAKING A WALK THAT DAY WE HAD BEEN WANDERING INDEED IN THE LEAFLESS SHRUBBERY AN HOUR IN THE MORNING BUT SINCE DINNER MISSUS REED WHEN THERE WAS NO COMPANY DINED EARLY THE COLD WINTER WIND HAD BROUGHT WITH IT
AND HE'S A YEAR OLDER THAN FELIX
TO LET WHITE WASHED WALLS VOUCH FOR CLEAN SHRINES
AS THE VERY MASTER OF THAT WORKING CORPS WHO WOULD RESTORE TO RECTITUDE THE WARPED SYSTEM OF THINGS BECAUSE I THINK NO COMMENTATOR ON HIS WRITINGS HAS YET FOUND THE COMPARISON THAT SUITS HIM THE TERMS WHICH RIGHTLY CHARACTERISE HIS TALENT
AND YOU'VE GOT TO STOP IT PETER CRAIG
EITHER OF VISION OR CONCEPTION BUT ELIZA JUST PUT HER HEAD IN AT THE DOOR AND SAID AT ONCE
MY CARE WAS HOW TO ENDURE THE BLOW WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW THE INSULT WHAT WERE YOU DOING BEHIND THE CURTAIN HE ASKED I WAS READING SHOW THE BOOK I RETURNED TO THE WINDOW AND FETCHED IT THENCE
BUT TO FELIX EVERYTHING SUDDENLY BECAME FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE BECAUSE PETER CONTINUED TO HOLD THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF BITTER APPLES IT HAUNTED HIS WAKING HOURS AND OBSESSED HIS NIGHTS I HEARD HIM TALKING IN HIS SLEEP ABOUT IT
I WIPED MY TEARS AND HUSHED MY SOBS FEARFUL LEST ANY SIGN OF VIOLENT GRIEF MIGHT WAKEN A PRETERNATURAL VOICE TO COMFORT ME OR ELICIT FROM THE GLOOM SOME HALOED FACE BENDING OVER ME WITH STRANGE PITY
I CAN NOW CONJECTURE READILY THAT THIS STREAK OF LIGHT WAS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GLEAM FROM A LANTERN CARRIED BY SOME ONE ACROSS THE LAWN BUT THEN PREPARED AS MY MIND WAS FOR HORROR SHAKEN AS MY NERVES WERE BY AGITATION
GAMBLING WHAT WOULD AUNT JANE SAY IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO FIGHT CECILY DEMANDED OF PETER DON'T YOU DRAG MY AUNT JANE INTO THIS AFFAIR SAID PETER DARKLY YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE A PRESBYTERIAN
I TURN TO ANOTHER CLASS A SMALL ONE SO FAR AS I KNOW BUT NOT THEREFORE TO BE OVERLOOKED I MEAN THE TIMOROUS OR CARPING FEW WHO DOUBT THE TENDENCY OF SUCH BOOKS AS JANE EYRE IN WHOSE EYES WHATEVER IS UNUSUAL IS WRONG
A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF JANE EYRE BEING UNNECESSARY I GAVE NONE THIS SECOND EDITION DEMANDS A FEW WORDS BOTH OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS REMARK MY THANKS ARE DUE IN THREE QUARTERS
AT THIS MOMENT A LIGHT GLEAMED ON THE WALL WAS IT I ASKED MYSELF A RAY FROM THE MOON PENETRATING SOME APERTURE IN THE BLIND NO MOONLIGHT WAS STILL AND THIS STIRRED
BUT IF HE DOES THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SETTLE IT BUT HOW WILL THAT SETTLE IT ASKED CECILY
AND SO NO DOUBT SHE FELT IT I WAS A PRECOCIOUS ACTRESS IN HER EYES SHE SINCERELY LOOKED ON ME AS A COMPOUND OF VIRULENT PASSIONS MEAN SPIRIT AND DANGEROUS DUPLICITY BESSIE AND ABBOT HAVING RETREATED
AND I THOUGHT MISTER REED'S SPIRIT HARASSED BY THE WRONGS OF HIS SISTER'S CHILD MIGHT QUIT ITS ABODE WHETHER IN THE CHURCH VAULT OR IN THE UNKNOWN WORLD OF THE DEPARTED AND RISE BEFORE ME IN THIS CHAMBER
AND HE WAS STILL HER OWN DARLING I DARED COMMIT NO FAULT
MEN TOO OFTEN CONFOUND THEM THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONFOUNDED APPEARANCE SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR TRUTH NARROW HUMAN DOCTRINES THAT ONLY TEND TO ELATE AND MAGNIFY A FEW SHOULD NOT BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE WORLD REDEEMING CREED OF CHRIST
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN HER WAS THE REPLY I'VE TOLD MISSIS OFTEN MY OPINION ABOUT THE CHILD
BUT SHE ONLY WANTED TO BRING US ALL HERE I KNOW HER NAUGHTY TRICKS WHAT IS ALL THIS
NO YOU ARE LESS THAN A SERVANT FOR YOU DO NOTHING FOR YOUR KEEP THERE SIT DOWN AND THINK OVER YOUR WICKEDNESS THEY HAD GOT ME BY THIS TIME INTO THE APARTMENT INDICATED BY MISSUS REED AND HAD THRUST ME UPON A STOOL
I RETURNED TO MY BOOK
THAT CERTAINLY WAS A CRIME AND WAS I FIT TO DIE OR WAS THE VAULT UNDER THE CHANCEL OF GATESHEAD CHURCH AN INVITING BOURNE IN SUCH VAULT I HAD BEEN TOLD DID MISTER REED LIE BURIED AND LED BY THIS THOUGHT TO RECALL HIS IDEA
THESE THINGS AND DEEDS ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED
SHE NOW CAME UPON THE SCENE FOLLOWED BY BESSIE AND HER MAID ABBOT
TELL MAMA SHE IS RUN OUT INTO THE RAIN BAD ANIMAL IT IS WELL I DREW THE CURTAIN THOUGHT I AND I WISHED FERVENTLY HE MIGHT NOT DISCOVER MY HIDING PLACE NOR WOULD JOHN REED HAVE FOUND IT OUT HIMSELF HE WAS NOT QUICK
OF THESE DEATH WHITE REALMS I FORMED AN IDEA OF MY OWN
SHE NEVER SAW HIM STRIKE OR HEARD HIM ABUSE ME THOUGH HE DID BOTH NOW AND THEN IN HER VERY PRESENCE MORE FREQUENTLY HOWEVER BEHIND HER BACK
OR RATHER OUT OF MYSELF AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT A MOMENT'S MUTINY HAD ALREADY RENDERED ME LIABLE TO STRANGE PENALTIES AND LIKE ANY OTHER REBEL SLAVE I FELT RESOLVED IN MY DESPERATION TO GO ALL LENGTHS
BY THE QUALITY OF THE WINE HE DIRECTED TO BE SERVED THEREFORE WHEN AT DESSERT UPON A SIGN FROM D'ARTAGNAN PORTHOS HAD SENT AWAY HIS SERVANTS AND THE TWO FRIENDS WERE ALONE PORTHOS SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO WILL ATTEND YOU IN YOUR CAMPAIGNS
OH SIR GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH I LOVE REVERE YOU
NO INDEED SIR ANSWERED RAOUL
NOTHING BUT A PHANTOM TO WHOM HE LENT A SOUL AND YET SO POWERFUL IS MAJESTY AMONGST US THIS MAN HAS NOT EVEN THE HONOR OF A TOMB AT THE FEET OF HIM IN WHOSE SERVICE HIS LIFE WAS WORN AWAY REMEMBER RAOUL THIS
HE WHO FIRES THE FIRST SHOT RARELY HITS HIS MAN FOR HE FIRES WITH THE APPREHENSION OF BEING DISARMED BEFORE AN ARMED FOE THEN WHILST HE FIRES MAKE YOUR HORSE REAR
WE LIVED TOGETHER WE LOVED WE HATED TOGETHER WE SHED WE MINGLED OUR BLOOD TOGETHER AND TOO PROBABLY I MAY STILL ADD THAT THERE MAY BE YET A BOND BETWEEN US CLOSER EVEN THAN THAT OF FRIENDSHIP
AND PERHAPS HE COMPREHENDED ALL THAT PASSED IN THE HEART OF THE MAN WHO WAS AWAITING HIS AWAKENING AS A LOVER AWAITS THE AWAKENING OF HIS MISTRESS FOR HIS GLANCE IN RETURN HAD ALL THE TENDERNESS OF LOVE YOU ARE THERE SIR
HOWEVER BECAUSE I WAS PRUDENT YOU MUST NOT TAKE ME FOR A FOOL
BE IT SO CRIED ARAMIS CARDINALISTS OR FRONDEURS WHAT MATTERS IT LET US MEET AGAIN AS CAPITAL SECONDS IN A DUEL DEVOTED FRIENDS IN BUSINESS MERRY COMPANIONS IN OUR ANCIENT PLEASURES
THE HORSES ARE WAITING AND I WAS ASLEEP CRIED RAOUL WHILST YOU SIR YOU HAD THE KINDNESS TO ATTEND TO ALL THESE DETAILS TRULY SIR YOU OVERWHELM ME WITH BENEFITS
D'ARTAGNAN WHO AS A GASCON WAS INCLINED TO SOBRIETY
SHOWED TO PORTHOS A BLUE RIBBON AND A DUCAL MANTLE THEY WERE IN FACT ASLEEP ON THE TABLE WHEN THE SERVANTS CAME TO LIGHT THEM TO THEIR BED MOUSQUETON WAS HOWEVER SOMEWHAT CONSOLED BY D'ARTAGNAN WHO THE NEXT DAY TOLD HIM THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY
REMOUNTED THE STEPS WENT INTO THE CATHEDRAL THERE TO KNEEL DOWN IN THE DARKEST CORNER
BUT ALAS THE POOR FELLOW DOES NOT KNOW THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH I AM HERE HE THEN MADE A SIGN FOR MOUSQUETON TO COME TO HIM SIR SAID THE SERVANT I HAVE A FAVOUR TO ASK YOU SPEAK OUT MY FRIEND I AM AFRAID TO DO SO
BUT HE DID HIS BEST TO KEEP UP WITH HIS HOST MEANWHILE HIS MISGIVINGS IN REGARD TO MOUSQUETON RECURRED TO HIS MIND AND WITH GREATER FORCE BECAUSE MOUSQUETON THOUGH HE DID NOT HIMSELF WAIT ON THE TABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN BENEATH HIM IN HIS NEW POSITION APPEARED AT THE DOOR FROM TIME TO TIME
INSTEAD OF MAKING COMPLIMENTS TO EACH OTHER LET US EXPLAIN OUR CONDUCT TO EACH OTHER LIKE MEN OF RIGHT AND HONEST HEARTS I WISH FOR NOTHING MORE HAVE YOU ANY CAUSE OF COMPLAINT AGAINST ME OR MONSIEUR D'HERBLAY IF SO SPEAK OUT
THAT DEVIL PORTHOS IS A MAN OF PRODIGIOUS STRENGTH STILL IF ATHOS JOINS US
AFTER SPEAKING IN A LOW VOICE TO THE LACKEY WHO INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THEM IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THEIR ROOMS RAOUL DELIGHTED AT THE COUNT'S COMPANIONSHIP PERCEIVED OR AFFECTED TO PERCEIVE NOTHING OF THIS BYPLAY
TAKE CARE RAOUL I HAVE ALREADY OFTEN TOLD YOU OF THIS YOU MUST NOT FORGET IT FOR IT IS A GREAT DEFECT IN A RIDER SEE YOUR HORSE IS TIRED ALREADY HE FROTHS AT THE MOUTH WHILST MINE LOOKS AS IF HE HAD ONLY JUST LEFT THE STABLE
WELL SAID PORTHOS IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD YOU IN THE OLD TIMES THAT THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN PLANCHET WOULD RESCUE ROCHEFORT AND THAT YOU WOULD PROTECT HIM IN IT I SHOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED HIM BUT MEN ARE CHANGED BY EVENTS THERE IS NOTHING TRUER THAN THAT SAID PORTHOS
NOW TO HORSE THAT I MAY SEE YOU DEPART RAOUL OBEYED ADIEU RAOUL SAID THE COUNT ADIEU MY DEAREST BOY ADIEU SIR ADIEU MY BELOVED PROTECTOR
AND OF PIERREFONDS WHICH WAS BETWEEN COMPIEGNE AND VILLARS COTTERETS BUT FORMERLY IT APPEARS BEGAN MOUSQUETON TIMIDLY OH SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE DON'T NOW MAKE WAR AS WE DID FORMERLY TO DAY IT'S A SORT OF DIPLOMATIC ARRANGEMENT ASK PLANCHET
AND LET US RETAIN AS OUR BATTLE STANDARD
WHO BOWED AND PROCEEDED TOWARD THE BASEMENT COME RAOUL HE SAID LET US FOLLOW THIS MAN THE VERGER OPENED THE IRON GRATING THAT GUARDED THE ROYAL TOMBS AND STOOD ON THE TOPMOST STEP
AND HE WIPED HIS EYES STILL MOIST HAS NOT ONE OF YOU A CROSS ASKED ATHOS ARAMIS SMILED AND DREW FROM HIS VEST A CROSS OF DIAMONDS WHICH WAS HUNG AROUND HIS NECK BY A CHAIN OF PEARLS HERE IS ONE HE SAID
SAY IT THEN IF I AM IN FAULT I WILL AVOW THE ERROR THE GRAVE AND HARMONIOUS TONES OF THAT BELOVED VOICE SEEMED TO HAVE STILL ITS ANCIENT INFLUENCE WHILST THAT OF ARAMIS WHICH HAD BECOME HARSH AND TUNELESS IN HIS MOMENTS OF ILL HUMOR
GENTLEMEN HE SAID OUR PRESENCE HERE IS THE BEST PROOF OF FORMER FRIENDSHIP NOT ONE OF US HAS FAILED THE OTHERS AT THIS RENDEZVOUS NOT ONE HAS THEREFORE TO REPROACH HIMSELF HEAR ME COUNT REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
ROYALTY IS THE GIFT OF GOD WHENEVER YOU HESITATE AS TO WHOM YOU OUGHT TO SERVE ABANDON THE EXTERIOR THE MATERIAL APPEARANCE FOR THE INVISIBLE PRINCIPLE FOR THE INVISIBLE PRINCIPLE IS EVERYTHING
AND AS FOR ME SAID PORTHOS I SWEAR NOTHING BUT I'M CHOKED FORSOOTH IF I WERE OBLIGED TO FIGHT AGAINST YOU
YOU HOLD THE BIT TOO TIGHT AND SO MAKE HIS MOUTH HARD SO THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE HIM MANOEUVRE QUICKLY THE SAFETY OF A CAVALIER OFTEN DEPENDS ON THE PROMPT OBEDIENCE OF HIS HORSE
IRRITATED HIM HE ANSWERED THEREFORE I THINK MONSIEUR LE COMTE THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING TO COMMUNICATE TO ME AT YOUR CHATEAU OF BRAGELONNE AND THAT GENTLEMAN
BUT WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE OR CHANGES FOR THE BETTER IS WINE
HE DARED NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK AND RAOUL WENT AWAY HIS HEAD UNCOVERED ATHOS REMAINED MOTIONLESS LOOKING AFTER HIM UNTIL HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STREET THEN THE COUNT THREW THE BRIDLE OF HIS HORSE INTO THE HANDS OF A PEASANT
SINCE I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF BEING MY LORD'S STEWARD I HAVE TAKEN THE LAST NAME AS MORE DIGNIFIED AND CALCULATED TO MAKE MY INFERIORS RESPECT ME YOU SIR KNOW HOW NECESSARY SUBORDINATION IS IN ANY LARGE ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS D'ARTAGNAN SMILED
I SHALL PASS ALL MY LIFE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN IN SEEKING FOR A MAN WHO IS REALLY CONTENTED WITH HIS LOT WHILST MAKING THIS REFLECTION CHANCE SEEMED AS IT WERE TO GIVE HIM THE LIE DIRECT WHEN PORTHOS HAD LEFT HIM TO GIVE SOME ORDERS
TO FOUR MEN WHO COMPELLED SUCH A MAN AS RICHELIEU TO ACT AS WE PLEASED WHAT IS SUCH OR SUCH A PRINCE TO US WHO FIXED THE DIADEM UPON A GREAT QUEEN'S HEAD
WHILST HE ADMIRED THE DELICATE TENDERNESS WITH WHICH IT WAS BESTOWED
THERE WAS THIS MORNING IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE SOMETHING TARDY AND IRRESOLUTE HE WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE PREPARATIONS FOR RAOUL'S DEPARTURE AND WAS SEEKING TO GAIN TIME IN THE FIRST PLACE
SHOWING THE SERVANT RAOUL'S SHOULDER BELT TIGHTEN THE BUCKLE OF THE SWORD IT FALLS TOO LOW YOU WILL ACCOMPANY MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE TILL GRIMAUD REJOINS YOU YOU KNOW RAOUL GRIMAUD IS AN OLD AND ZEALOUS SERVANT HE WILL FOLLOW YOU YES SIR ANSWERED RAOUL
WE SHOULD BE SO ON THIS OCCASION IF ONLY TO BE FAITHFUL TO OUR OATH SAID ARAMIS AH I'M READY TO DO WHAT YOU WILL CRIED PORTHOS EVEN TO SWEAR BY MAHOMET DEVIL TAKE ME IF I'VE EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS AT THIS MOMENT
THEY PROCEEDED SILENTLY TO THE CENTRE OF THE PLACE BUT AS AT THIS VERY MOMENT THE MOON HAD JUST EMERGED FROM BEHIND A CLOUD THEY THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE OBSERVED IF THEY REMAINED ON THAT SPOT AND THEREFORE REGAINED THE SHADE OF THE LIME TREES
I SEEM TO READ YOUR FUTURE DESTINY AS THROUGH A CLOUD IT WILL BE HAPPIER I THINK THAN OURS HAS BEEN DIFFERENT IN YOUR FATE FROM US YOU WILL HAVE A KING WITHOUT A MINISTER WHOM YOU MAY SERVE LOVE RESPECT
THAT MANOEUVRE HAS SAVED MY LIFE SEVERAL TIMES I SHALL DO SO IF ONLY IN GRATITUDE
AND I EVEN I OPPOSED THE DESIGNS OF THE GREAT MAN WHO HELD THE DESTINIES OF FRANCE WITHIN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND RAOUL LEARN HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE KING FROM ROYALTY THE KING IS BUT A MAN
WHY REPLIED PORTHOS MOUSTON OF COURSE THIS WAS A BLOW TO D'ARTAGNAN HE COULD ALREADY SEE THE INTENDANT'S BEAMING SMILE CHANGE TO A CONTORTION OF GRIEF BUT HE SAID MOUSTON IS NOT SO YOUNG AS HE WAS MY DEAR FELLOW BESIDES HE HAS GROWN FAT
MOUSQUETON INQUIRED THEREFORE THE STATE OF THE CASE OF HIS OLD FRIEND WHO CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT OF D'ARTAGNAN BUT HE ADDED IN THIS WAR PRISONERS STAND A CHANCE OF BEING HUNG THE DEUCE THEY DO SAID MOUSQUETON I THINK I SHOULD LIKE THE SIEGE OF ROCHELLE BETTER THAN THIS WAR THEN
EXTENDED HIS HAND WITH THE AIR OF SUPREME COMMAND WHICH CHARACTERIZED HIM ALONE DREW OUT HIS SWORD AND THE SCABBARD AT THE SAME TIME BROKE THE BLADE IN THE SHEATH ON HIS KNEE AND THREW THE PIECES TO HIS RIGHT THEN TURNING TO ARAMIS
BECAUSE OVER THIS KING WATCHED THE SPIRIT OF ANOTHER MAN EVEN AS THIS LAMP KEEPS VIGIL OVER THIS COFFIN AND ILLUMINES IT HE WHOSE INTELLECT WAS THUS SUPREME RAOUL WAS THE ACTUAL SOVEREIGN THE OTHER
YOURS IS A NOBLE NATURE HE SAID HERE IS YOUR SWORD RAOUL BENT HIS KNEE TO THE GROUND IT WAS WORN BY MY FATHER A LOYAL GENTLEMAN
LET US PUT OUR SWORDS INTO OUR LEFT HANDS AND SHAKE HANDS WITH THE RIGHT
WHEN THE HILT WAS IN MY HAND AND THE SHEATH AT MY SIDE SHOULD YOUR HAND STILL BE TOO WEAK TO USE THIS SWORD RAOUL SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU WILL HAVE THE MORE TIME TO LEARN TO DRAW IT ONLY WHEN IT OUGHT TO BE USED SIR REPLIED RAOUL
THEY SET OUT PASSING OVER THE PONT NEUF
AND JUST BELOW THIS LAMP THERE WAS LAID WRAPPED IN A FLOWING MANTLE OF VIOLET VELVET
I OWE YOU EVERYTHING AND YET THIS SWORD IS THE MOST PRECIOUS GIFT YOU HAVE YET MADE ME I WILL WEAR IT I SWEAR TO YOU AS A GRATEFUL MAN SHOULD DO TIS WELL ARISE VICOMTE EMBRACE ME
FOR I NEVER LOVED ANY ONE BUT YOU IN THE WIDE WORLD AND HONEST PORTHOS BURST INTO TEARS AS HE EMBRACED ATHOS MY FRIENDS SAID ATHOS THIS IS WHAT I EXPECTED FROM SUCH HEARTS AS YOURS YES I HAVE SAID IT AND I NOW REPEAT IT
THEN ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING RAOUL SHOULD YOU BE WOUNDED IN A BATTLE AND FALL FROM YOUR HORSE IF YOU HAVE ANY STRENGTH LEFT DISENTANGLE YOURSELF FROM THE LINE THAT YOUR REGIMENT HAS FORMED OTHERWISE IT MAY BE DRIVEN BACK
PERHAPS YOU WILL THINK SIR THAT PROSPERITY HAS SPOILED ME ART THOU HAPPY FRIEND ASKED D'ARTAGNAN AS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE
IN THE POSITION OF PORTHOS D'ARTAGNAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY AND TO MAKE PORTHOS CONTENTED THERE WAS WANTING WHAT FIVE LETTERS TO PUT BEFORE HIS THREE NAMES A TINY CORONET TO PAINT UPON THE PANELS OF HIS CARRIAGE
THERE WAS A SOLEMN THOUGH MOMENTARY SILENCE WHICH WAS BROKEN BY ARAMIS I SWEAR HE SAID WITH A CALM BROW AND KINDLY GLANCE BUT IN A VOICE STILL TREMBLING WITH RECENT EMOTION I SWEAR THAT I NO LONGER BEAR ANIMOSITY TO THOSE WHO WERE ONCE MY FRIENDS
AND GO TO THE HOTEL DE LA CHEVRETTE RUE TIQUETONNE AND THERE AWAIT ME THAT'S AGREED SAID PORTHOS AS TO MYSELF I SHALL GO AROUND TO SEE ATHOS FOR THOUGH I DON'T THINK HIS AID WORTH MUCH ONE MUST WITH ONE'S FRIENDS OBSERVE ALL DUE POLITENESS SAID D'ARTAGNAN
ARAMIS STARTED BACK AND DREW HIS D'ARTAGNAN BENT FORWARD READY EITHER TO ATTACK OR TO STAND ON HIS DEFENSE
IN RECALLING ALL HE HAD BEEN THROUGH HE FORESAW ALL THAT RAOUL MIGHT SUFFER AND THE EXPRESSION OF THE DEEP AND TENDER COMPASSION WHICH THROBBED IN HIS HEART WAS PICTURED IN THE MOIST EYE WITH WHICH HE GAZED ON THE YOUNG MAN
JOY SHONE IN RAOUL'S EYES AND HE LEAPED LIGHTLY TO HIS SADDLE
HE SAW MOUSQUETON APPROACHING THE FACE OF THE STEWARD DESPITE ONE SLIGHT SHADE OF CARE LIGHT AS A SUMMER CLOUD SEEMED A PHYSIOGNOMY OF ABSOLUTE FELICITY HERE IS WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN
HOW DO YOU FEEL THIS MORNING HE INQUIRED PERFECTLY WELL QUITE RESTED SIR YOU ARE STILL GROWING ATHOS CONTINUED WITH THAT CHARMING AND PATERNAL INTEREST FELT BY A GROWN MAN FOR A YOUTH OH SIR I BEG YOUR PARDON EXCLAIMED RAOUL
WHICH IS THAT IN FIRING OFF YOUR PISTOL YOU HOLD YOUR ARM TOO FAR OUTSTRETCHED THIS TENSION LESSENS THE ACCURACY OF THE AIM SO IN TWELVE TIMES YOU THRICE MISSED THE MARK WHICH YOU SIR STRUCK TWELVE TIMES ANSWERED RAOUL SMILING
POLISH UP OR MAKE SOME ONE ELSE POLISH MY ARMS THEN TAKE PISTOLS WITH THEE AND A HUNTING KNIFE ARE WE THEN GOING TO TRAVEL MY LORD ASKED MOUSQUETON RATHER UNEASY SOMETHING BETTER STILL MOUSTON AN EXPEDITION SIR ASKED THE STEWARD WHOSE ROSES BEGAN TO CHANGE INTO LILIES
SHOULD ANY HARM BEFALL ME YOUR NAME WILL BE THE LAST NAME THAT I SHALL UTTER THE REMEMBRANCE OF YOU MY LAST THOUGHT
HE HAS SET UP A LITTLE SHOP IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS AND IS NOW A CONFECTIONER AH HE IS A CONFECTIONER IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS
OF SUCH A MAN AS YOU ARAMIS
NOW HATE ME IF YOU CAN BUT FOR MY OWN PART I SHALL EVER EVEN IF YOU DO HATE ME RETAIN ESTEEM AND FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU I REPEAT MY WORDS ARAMIS AND THEN IF YOU DESIRE IT AND IF THEY DESIRE IT LET US SEPARATE FOREVER FROM OUR OLD FRIENDS
RAOUL AROSE AND THREW HIMSELF WITH EMOTION INTO THE COUNT'S ARMS ADIEU FALTERED THE COUNT WHO FELT HIS HEART DIE AWAY WITHIN HIM ADIEU AND THINK OF ME
IF RICHELIEU MADE THE KING BY COMPARISON SEEM SMALL HE MADE ROYALTY GREAT THE PALACE OF THE LOUVRE CONTAINS TWO THINGS THE KING WHO MUST DIE AND ROYALTY WHICH NEVER DIES
WHO HAS SO WARMLY WELCOMED ME WILL MONSIEUR REMAIN LONG WITH US ASKED MOUSQUETON WITH A SERENE AND GLOWING COUNTENANCE I GO TO MORROW MY FRIEND REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN AH MONSIEUR SAID MOUSQUETON THEN YOU HAVE COME HERE ONLY TO AWAKEN OUR REGRETS
ASHAMED OF SO MUCH ATTENTION IN AN INSTANT I SHALL BE DRESSED ATHOS THEN CALLED OLIVAIN
ARE NOT THOSE FELLOWS POACHERS THEY HAVE ARRESTED YONDER
AND PERHAPS HAS LOST HIS FITNESS FOR ACTIVE SERVICE THAT MAY BE TRUE REPLIED PORTHOS BUT I AM USED TO HIM AND BESIDES HE WOULDN'T BE WILLING TO LET ME GO WITHOUT HIM HE LOVES ME SO MUCH OH BLIND SELF LOVE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN AND YOU ASKED PORTHOS
ZOUNDS MY WEAPONS WHAT WEAPONS MY MILITARY WEAPONS YES MY LORD AT ANY RATE I THINK SO MAKE SURE OF IT AND IF THEY WANT IT HAVE THEM BURNISHED UP WHICH IS MY BEST CAVALRY HORSE VULCAN AND THE BEST HACK
YOU SAY STRANGE THINGS SAID ARAMIS YOU CAME SEEKING ME TO MAKE TO ME CERTAIN PROPOSALS BUT DID YOU MAKE THEM NO YOU SOUNDED ME NOTHING MORE VERY WELL WHAT DID I SAY TO YOU
SHOULD THE KING PROVE A TYRANT FOR POWER BEGETS TYRANNY SERVE LOVE RESPECT ROYALTY THAT DIVINE RIGHT THAT CELESTIAL SPARK WHICH MAKES THIS DUST STILL POWERFUL AND HOLY SO THAT WE
AND HE LOOKED AT D'ARTAGNAN WITH AN AIR OF REPROACH HE STAGGERED AND HIS VOICE WAS ALMOST CHOKED YES AND NO WE SHALL SERVE IN A CAMPAIGN SEEK OUT ALL SORTS OF ADVENTURES RETURN IN SHORT TO OUR FORMER LIFE THESE LAST WORDS FELL ON MOUSQUETON LIKE A THUNDERBOLT
YOU SPEAK CHARMINGLY SAID PORTHOS AND ARE THE FIRST OF MEN ADDED D'ARTAGNAN YOU EXCEL US ALL ATHOS SMILED WITH INEFFABLE PLEASURE TIS THEN ALL SETTLED GENTLEMEN YOUR HANDS
HE SAID RESPECTFULLY YES RAOUL REPLIED THE COUNT AND YOU DID NOT AWAKEN ME I WISHED TO LEAVE YOU STILL TO ENJOY SOME MOMENTS OF SLEEP MY CHILD YOU MUST BE FATIGUED FROM YESTERDAY OH SIR HOW GOOD YOU ARE
AND HE ADDED TURNING TO PORTHOS HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO'S OF THE SAME OPINION AS MYSELF PORTHOS WHO HAD NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD ANSWERED MERELY BY A WORD AND A GESTURE
HE HIMSELF FURBISHED A SWORD WHICH HE DREW FROM ITS PERFUMED LEATHER SHEATH HE EXAMINED IT TO SEE IF ITS HILT WAS WELL GUARDED AND IF THE BLADE WAS FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE HILT THEN HE PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VALISE BELONGING TO THE YOUNG MAN
A LOVE AS TENDER AS THAT OF A LOVER FOR HIS MISTRESS DWELLS UNDOUBTEDLY IN SOME PATERNAL HEARTS TOWARD A SON
PORTHOS MEANTIME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN TO GIVE HIM HIS INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO PROCEED ON HIS JOURNEY FOUR DAYS REPLIED HIS FRIEND ARE NECESSARY TO REACH BLOIS ONE DAY TO REST THERE THREE OR FOUR DAYS TO RETURN TO PARIS SET OUT THEREFORE IN A WEEK WITH YOUR SUITE
PORTHOS WANTED TO LENGTHEN OUT HIS NAMES MOUSQUETON TO CUT HIS SHORT WELL MY DEAR MOUSTON HE SAID REST SATISFIED I WILL CALL THEE MOUSTON AND IF IT MAKES THEE HAPPY I WILL NOT TUTOYER YOU ANY LONGER
PENETRATED INTO THE ROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW THE CURTAINS OF WHICH RAOUL HAD NEGLECTED TO CLOSE ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HE WAS STILL SLEEPING HIS HEAD GRACEFULLY REPOSING ON HIS ARM
WHO SEEMS AS IF HE WERE GOING TO JOIN THE ARMY
IT WAS THOSE VERY TERRIBLE OLD DAYS THAT MADE THE PRESENT SO EXCESSIVELY DELIGHTFUL AND THE BLOW WAS SO GREAT HE RUSHED OUT OVERCOME AND FORGOT TO SHUT THE DOOR THE TWO FRIENDS REMAINED ALONE TO SPEAK OF THE FUTURE AND TO BUILD CASTLES IN THE AIR
TIS ONLY BECAUSE MONSIEUR DE LA FERE HAS SPOKEN OF FRIENDSHIP THAT I QUESTION YOUR CONDUCT
THEN CALLED L'ABREUVOIR PEPIN
WE ARE GOING TO RETURN TO THE SERVICE MOUSTON REPLIED PORTHOS STILL TRYING TO RESTORE HIS MUSTACHE TO THE MILITARY CURL IT HAD LONG LOST INTO THE SERVICE THE KING'S SERVICE MOUSQUETON TREMBLED EVEN HIS FAT SMOOTH CHEEKS SHOOK AS HE SPOKE
HAD HIS OBJECT AND REWARD BUT POOR MOUSQUETON WHOSE ONLY WISH WAS TO BE CALLED MOUSTON WAS IT NOT CRUEL TO SNATCH HIM FROM THE DELIGHTFUL STATE OF PEACE AND PLENTY IN WHICH HE WAS HE WAS THINKING OF THESE MATTERS WHEN PORTHOS SUMMONED HIM TO DINNER WHAT
SWEAR ON THIS CROSS WHICH IN SPITE OF ITS MAGNIFICENT MATERIAL IS STILL A CROSS
HE REMEMBERED THAT ALL THE FIRST PART OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN EMBITTERED BY A WOMAN AND HE THOUGHT WITH ALARM OF THE INFLUENCE LOVE MIGHT ASSUME OVER SO FINE AND AT THE SAME TIME SO VIGOROUS AN ORGANIZATION AS THAT OF RAOUL
OUR DESTINIES ARE IRREVOCABLY UNITED ALTHOUGH WE NOW PURSUE DIVERGENT ROADS I RESPECT YOUR CONVICTIONS AND WHILST WE FIGHT FOR OPPOSITE SIDES LET US REMAIN FRIENDS
A SMALL BAG OF LOUIS CALLED OLIVAIN THE LACKEY WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM FROM BLOIS AND MADE HIM PACK THE VALISE UNDER HIS OWN EYES WATCHFUL TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE PUT IN WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL TO A YOUNG MAN ENTERING ON HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN
THESE PROCEEDINGS MADE D'ARTAGNAN AND PORTHOS DRAW BACK D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT DRAW HIS SWORD PORTHOS PUT HIS BACK INTO THE SHEATH NEVER EXCLAIMED ATHOS RAISING HIS RIGHT HAND TO HEAVEN NEVER
OH CRIED MOUSQUETON REDDENING WITH JOY IF YOU DO ME SIR SUCH HONOR I SHALL BE GRATEFUL ALL MY LIFE IT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK ALAS THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN IT IS VERY LITTLE TO OFFSET THE UNEXPECTED TRIBULATIONS I AM BRINGING TO THIS POOR DEVIL
PLANCHET YES I HAVE FOUND HIM AGAIN
BUT IMAGINATION HAS THE WINGS OF AN ANGEL OF LIGHT AND TRAVELS SAFELY THROUGH OR OVER THE SEAS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ALMOST SHIPWRECKED THE DARKNESS IN WHICH OUR ILLUSIONS ARE LOST THE PRECIPICE WHENCE OUR HAPPINESS HAS BEEN HURLED AND SWALLOWED UP
HE LOOKED LONG ON THIS YOUNG MAN WHOSE SMILING MOUTH AND HALF CLOSED EYES BESPOKE SOFT DREAMS AND LIGHTEST SLUMBER AS IF HIS GUARDIAN ANGEL WATCHED OVER HIM WITH SOLICITUDE AND AFFECTION
WELL WHY SHOULD NOT WE TOO BELONG TO A PARTY YOU HAD YOUR SECRET AND WE HAD OURS WE DIDN'T EXCHANGE THEM SO MUCH THE BETTER IT PROVES THAT WE KNOW HOW TO KEEP OUR SECRETS I DO NOT REPROACH YOU MONSIEUR SAID D'ARTAGNAN
WHEN I SAW YOU AT YOUR CHATEAU AT BRAGELONNE
A CATAFALQUE RESTING ON TRESTLES OF OAK THE YOUNG MAN PREPARED FOR THIS SCENE BY THE STATE OF HIS OWN FEELINGS WHICH WERE MOURNFUL AND BY THE MAJESTY OF THE CATHEDRAL WHICH HE HAD PASSED THROUGH DESCENDED IN A SLOW AND SOLEMN MANNER
WHAT IS HE THEN WITH HIS SIXTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS YOU REMEMBER THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS HE EARNED AT THE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE
BY HIS MANNER SIR AND HIS AGE HE'S THE SECOND TO DAY HAS A YOUNG MAN SUCH AS I AM GONE THROUGH THIS MORNING THEN ASKED RAOUL FAITH YES WITH A HAUGHTY PRESENCE A FINE EQUIPAGE SUCH AS THE SON OF A NOBLE HOUSE WOULD HAVE
D'ARTAGNAN HE SAID YOU ARE HERE TO NIGHT STILL INFURIATED BY YESTERDAY'S ADVENTURE I BELIEVED YOUR HEART NOBLE ENOUGH TO ENABLE A FRIENDSHIP OF TWENTY YEARS TO OVERCOME AN AFFRONT OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR COME DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME
OH NO NO DO NOT GO AWAY EXCLAIMED D'ARTAGNAN IMPELLED BY ONE OF THOSE IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSES WHICH SHOWED THE NOBILITY OF HIS NATURE THE NATIVE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS CHARACTER I SWEAR THAT I WOULD GIVE THE LAST DROP OF MY BLOOD AND THE LAST FRAGMENT OF MY LIMBS
BECAUSE I BENT MY ARM AND RESTED MY HAND ON MY ELBOW SO DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN YES SIR I HAVE FIRED SINCE IN THAT MANNER AND HAVE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL WHAT A COLD WIND RESUMED ATHOS A WINTRY BLAST
ALAS HE CANNOT MAKE ME FORGET WHAT I SHALL HAVE LOST THUS TALKING THEY TRAVERSED THE STREETS FULL OF PEOPLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE FETE AND ARRIVED OPPOSITE THE OLD CATHEDRAL WHERE FIRST MASS WAS GOING ON
BEFORE THESE MORTAL SPOILS OF THE LAST KING WHO WAS NOT TO BE PLACED BY THE SIDE OF HIS FOREFATHERS UNTIL HIS SUCCESSOR SHOULD TAKE HIS PLACE THERE AND WHO APPEARED TO ABIDE ON THAT SPOT THAT HE MIGHT THUS ADDRESS HUMAN PRIDE
AT THIS MOMENT RAOUL AWOKE WITHOUT A CLOUD ON HIS FACE WITHOUT WEARINESS OR LASSITUDE
I CONSIDER IT WORTHY CONDUCT OF A PUPIL OF JESUITS ON SEEING D'ARTAGNAN RISE PORTHOS ROSE ALSO THESE FOUR MEN WERE THEREFORE ALL STANDING AT THE SAME TIME WITH A MENACING ASPECT OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER UPON HEARING D'ARTAGNAN'S REPLY
GENTLEMEN NEVERTHELESS OF RANK AND CONDITION ARE AS NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THE COLD CORPSE THERE EXTENDED I SHALL ADORE GOD SIR SAID RAOUL RESPECT ROYALTY AND EVER SERVE THE KING AND IF DEATH BE MY LOT
WAR WOULD ALWAYS BE CARRIED ON IN THE HEART OF PARIS AND WITHIN REACH OF THE CHATEAU DU VALLON
AND WHO IN THE DARKNESS OF THIS NIGHT HEARETH US NEVER SHALL MY SWORD CROSS YOURS NEVER MY EYE EXPRESS A GLANCE OF ANGER
OLIVAIN TAKE CARE OF OUR HORSES AND GIVE ME MY SWORD THE TWO GENTLEMEN THEN WENT INTO THE CHURCH
SO FRESH HIS OWN YOUTH SEEMED TO REAPPEAR BRINGING WITH IT ALL THOSE SAVOURY REMEMBRANCES WHICH ARE LIKE PERFUMES MORE THAN THOUGHTS BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE PRESENT WAS AN INEFFABLE ABYSS
SO SURE TO BE EXALTED BY THE GLORIES OF A THRONE DUST OF THE EARTH HERE I AWAIT THEE THERE WAS PROFOUND SILENCE
AND THOSE WHOM HE RECEIVES WITH A WOODEN LADDER I COULD HAVE SPOKEN OUT WHAT ARE YOU MEDDLING WITH CRIED ARAMIS PALE WITH ANGER SUSPECTING THAT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ACTED AS A SPY ON HIM AND HAD SEEN HIM WITH MADAME DE LONGUEVILLE
TO DINNER SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHAT TIME IS IT THEN EH WHY IT IS AFTER ONE O'CLOCK YOUR HOME IS A PARADISE PORTHOS ONE TAKES NO NOTE OF TIME I FOLLOW YOU THOUGH I AM NOT HUNGRY COME IF ONE CAN'T ALWAYS EAT ONE CAN ALWAYS DRINK
WE ARE JUDGES OF WOUNDS WE OLD SOLDIERS ATHOS ADDED SMILING THANK YOU SIR ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN MUCH MOVED THEY ARRIVED THAT VERY MOMENT AT THE GATE OF THE TOWN GUARDED BY TWO SENTINELS HERE COMES A YOUNG GENTLEMAN SAID ONE OF THEM
BUT THE GARTER WAS SO BASHFUL SO MODEST AND THOUGHT IT WAS A STRANGE QUESTION TO ANSWER YOU ARE CERTAINLY A GIRDLE SAID THE COLLAR THAT IS TO SAY AN INSIDE GIRDLE
THEY ARE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY ALSO THEY MAKE THEIR NESTS UNDER SUN DIALS ALSO THEY LIVE ON CHEESE
AND WENT PROUDLY OVER THE COLLAR FOR SHE FANCIED SHE WAS A STEAM ENGINE THAT WOULD GO ON THE RAILROAD AND DRAW THE WAGGONS RAG
HUMPTY DUMPTY WENT ON WAGGING HIS HEAD GRAVELY FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR TO GET THEIR WAGES YOU KNOW ALICE DIDN'T VENTURE TO ASK WHAT HE PAID THEM WITH
PARTICULARLY VERBS THEY'RE THE PROUDEST ADJECTIVES YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH BUT NOT VERBS HOWEVER I CAN MANAGE THE WHOLE LOT OF THEM
AND WRITE IT DOWN I WILL IF I CAN REMEMBER IT SO LONG
ALICE SAID INDIGNANTLY TOO PROUD THE OTHER INQUIRED
DO YOU SEEK MY HAND SAID THE SCISSORS
AND IT HAPPENED THAT IT CAME TO BE WASHED IN COMPANY WITH A GARTER NAY SAID THE COLLAR
THOUGH I HAVEN'T TIME TO LOOK IT OVER THOROUGHLY JUST NOW
IMPENETRABILITY THAT'S WHAT I SAY
AND HOW EXACTLY LIKE AN EGG HE IS SHE SAID ALOUD STANDING WITH HER HANDS READY TO CATCH HIM FOR SHE WAS EVERY MOMENT EXPECTING HIM TO FALL
EVIDENTLY ADDRESSED TO A TREE SO SHE STOOD AND SOFTLY REPEATED TO HERSELF HUMPTY DUMPTY SAT ON A WALL HUMPTY DUMPTY HAD A GREAT FALL ALL THE KING'S
WITH A KIND OF SNEEZE IN THE MIDDLE HOWEVER YOU'LL HEAR IT DONE MAYBE DOWN IN THE WOOD YONDER AND WHEN YOU'VE ONCE HEARD IT YOU'LL BE QUITE CONTENT
OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY SHE REPEATED THIS ALOUD AS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE SUCH A LONG WORD TO SAY OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY PEOPLE
IS A THIN SHABBY LOOKING BIRD
AND THEY'RE SOMETHING LIKE CORKSCREWS
BUT THE COLLAR CAME TO BE JUST THIS VERY PIECE OF WHITE PAPER WE HERE SEE AND ON WHICH THE STORY IS PRINTED AND THAT WAS BECAUSE IT BOASTED SO TERRIBLY AFTERWARDS OF WHAT HAD
THERE WAS A LARGE COMPANY OF RAGS THE FINE BY THEMSELVES AND THE COARSE BY THEMSELVES JUST AS IT SHOULD BE THEY ALL HAD MUCH TO SAY
I THINK IT WAS
THE LITTLE FISHES ARE IN BED I SAID TO HIM I SAID IT PLAIN THEN YOU MUST WAKE THEM UP AGAIN I SAID IT VERY LOUD AND CLEAR
A BELT I MEAN I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE ADDED IN DISMAY
FOR WE CAN NEVER KNOW IF WE MAY NOT IN THE COURSE OF TIME ALSO COME INTO THE RAG CHEST AND BE MADE INTO WHITE PAPER AND THEN HAVE OUR
MOUTH UNDER IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME NOW IF YOU HAD THE TWO EYES ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE NOSE FOR INSTANCE OR THE MOUTH AT THE TOP THAT
AND A GOOD HANDSOME SHAPE IT IS TOO WITH A NAME LIKE YOURS YOU MIGHT BE ANY SHAPE ALMOST
HUMPTY DUMPTY EXCLAIMED TRIUMPHANTLY YOU NEVER SAID A WORD LIKE IT
HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF BEING BETROTHED YES OF COURSE YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT SAID THE HAIR COMB
THAT'S A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE ONE WORD MEAN ALICE SAID IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE WHEN I MAKE A WORD DO A LOT OF WORK LIKE THAT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY
ASK ANOTHER DON'T YOU THINK YOU'D BE SAFER DOWN ON THE GROUND
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY AND IT'S MY TURN TO CHOOSE A SUBJECT HE TALKS ABOUT IT JUST AS IF IT WAS A GAME THOUGHT ALICE SO HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU
BUT HE HAD THE FINEST FALSE COLLARS IN THE WORLD AND IT IS ABOUT ONE OF THESE COLLARS THAT WE ARE NOW TO HEAR A STORY IT WAS SO OLD THAT IT BEGAN TO THINK OF MARRIAGE
YES ALL HIS HORSES AND ALL HIS MEN HUMPTY DUMPTY WENT ON THEY'D PICK ME UP AGAIN IN A MINUTE THEY WOULD HOWEVER
SHE SAID AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD I SHOULDN'T KNOW YOU AGAIN IF WE DID MEET HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLIED IN A DISCONTENTED TONE GIVING HER ONE OF HIS FINGERS TO SHAKE
PRUDE EXCLAIMED THE COLLAR AND THEN IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE WASHING TUB IT WAS STARCHED HUNG OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR IN THE SUNSHINE AND WAS THEN LAID ON THE IRONING BLANKET
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR OF COURSE HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKED DOUBTFUL I'D RATHER SEE THAT DONE ON PAPER HE SAID
WHO BECAME GLOWING HOT BUT I LEFT HER STANDING TILL SHE GOT BLACK AGAIN THERE WAS ALSO THE FIRST OPERA DANCER SHE GAVE ME THAT CUT
HE SAID I'D GO AND WAKE THEM IF I TOOK A CORKSCREW FROM THE SHELF I WENT TO WAKE THEM UP MYSELF AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED I PULLED AND PUSHED
HUMPTY DUMPTY CRIED BREAKING INTO A SUDDEN PASSION YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING AT DOORS AND BEHIND TREES AND DOWN CHIMNEYS OR YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT
THE FISHES ANSWERED
SHE SAID THAT ONE CAN'T HELP GROWING OLDER ONE CAN'T PERHAPS SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY BUT TWO CAN
SAID ALICE WHAT THAT MEANS NOW YOU TALK LIKE A REASONABLE CHILD SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING VERY MUCH PLEASED I MEANT BY IMPENETRABILITY
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY ALICE DIDN'T WANT TO BEGIN ANOTHER ARGUMENT SO SHE SAID NOTHING SEVEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS HUMPTY DUMPTY REPEATED THOUGHTFULLY
I SEE WELL THAT YOU ARE BOTH FOR USE AND ORNAMENT
HE SAID AT LAST WHEN A PERSON DOESN'T KNOW A CRAVAT FROM A BELT I KNOW IT'S VERY IGNORANT OF ME ALICE SAID
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE SAID ALICE AND HOW MANY BIRTHDAYS HAVE YOU ONE
I BEG YOUR PARDON ALICE SAID WITH A PUZZLED AIR I'M NOT OFFENDED SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY I MEAN WHAT IS AN UN BIRTHDAY PRESENT
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
OH SAID ALICE SHE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO MAKE ANY OTHER REMARK AH YOU SHOULD SEE EM
ALL THAT HARD STUFF TO YOU I READ IT IN A BOOK SAID ALICE BUT I HAD SOME POETRY REPEATED TO ME MUCH EASIER THAN THAT
HUMPTY DUMPTY TOOK THE BOOK AND LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY THAT SEEMS TO BE DONE RIGHT HE BEGAN YOU'RE HOLDING IT UPSIDE DOWN ALICE INTERRUPTED
IF IT COMES TO THAT OH IT NEEDN'T COME TO THAT ALICE HASTILY SAID HOPING TO KEEP HIM FROM BEGINNING THE PIECE I'M GOING TO REPEAT
SHE SAID GOOD BYE ONCE MORE AND GETTING NO ANSWER TO THIS SHE QUIETLY WALKED AWAY BUT SHE COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO HERSELF AS SHE WENT
SHE WAS SO FEROCIOUS MY OWN HAIR COMB WAS IN LOVE WITH ME SHE LOST ALL HER TEETH
ALICE COULDN'T HELP SMILING AS SHE TOOK OUT HER MEMORANDUM BOOK AND WORKED THE SUM FOR HIM
AND SO FINE SO SOFT AND SO NEAT
BUT HUMPTY DUMPTY ONLY SHUT HIS EYES AND SAID WAIT TILL YOU'VE TRIED ALICE WAITED A MINUTE TO SEE IF HE WOULD SPEAK AGAIN
WHICH WAS NECK AND WHICH WAS WAIST EVIDENTLY HUMPTY DUMPTY WAS VERY ANGRY
CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY HIMSELF IT CAN'T BE ANYBODY ELSE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I'M AS CERTAIN OF IT
I SAID YOU LOOKED LIKE AN EGG SIR ALICE GENTLY EXPLAINED
IT'S VERY PROVOKING HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID AFTER A LONG SILENCE LOOKING AWAY FROM ALICE AS HE SPOKE TO BE CALLED AN EGG VERY
AND AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE FELL OFF THE WALL IN DOING SO AND OFFERED ALICE HIS HAND SHE WATCHED HIM A LITTLE ANXIOUSLY AS SHE TOOK IT
HUMPTY DUMPTY REMARKED SEVERELY ALICE WAS SILENT IN SPRING WHEN WOODS ARE GETTING GREEN
HORSES AND ALL THE KING'S MEN COULDN'T PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY IN HIS PLACE AGAIN THAT LAST LINE IS MUCH TOO LONG FOR THE POETRY SHE ADDED
THERE'S GLORY FOR YOU
AT THE EDGE AND SO CAME THE LONG SCISSORS TO CUT OFF THE JAGGED PART OH SAID THE COLLAR YOU ARE CERTAINLY THE FIRST OPERA DANCER
SO SHE SAT DOWN AND SAID
HUMPTY DUMPTY SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY OF COURSE YOU DON'T TILL I TELL YOU I MEANT THERE'S A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT FOR YOU
SHE FELT THAT IT WOULD HARDLY BE CIVIL TO STAY SO SHE GOT UP AND HELD OUT HER HAND GOOD BYE
THEY HAD HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF THE SUBJECT OF AGE SHE THOUGHT AND IF THEY REALLY WERE TO TAKE TURNS IN CHOOSING SUBJECTS IT WAS HER TURN NOW AT LEAST
AS IF HIS NAME WERE WRITTEN ALL OVER HIS FACE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A HUNDRED TIMES EASILY ON THAT ENORMOUS FACE HUMPTY DUMPTY WAS SITTING WITH
IN WINTER WHEN THE FIELDS ARE WHITE I SING THIS SONG FOR YOUR DELIGHT ONLY I DON'T SING IT HE ADDED AS AN EXPLANATION
THAT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT SUBJECT AND IT WOULD BE JUST AS WELL IF YOU'D MENTION WHAT YOU MEAN TO DO NEXT AS I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T MEAN TO STOP HERE ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
ALMOST OUT LOUD FORGETTING THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY WOULD HEAR HER DON'T STAND THERE CHATTERING TO YOURSELF LIKE THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID LOOKING AT HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
IT MEANS JUST WHAT
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A HISTORY OF ENGLAND THAT IS NOW TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME I'M ONE THAT HAS SPOKEN TO A KING I AM
NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THE QUESTION IS SAID ALICE WHETHER YOU CAN MAKE WORDS MEAN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
AND A GOOD MANY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INVENTED JUST YET THIS SOUNDED VERY HOPEFUL SO ALICE REPEATED THE FIRST VERSE TWAS BRILLIG
IS THE GRASS PLOT ROUND A SUN DIAL I SUPPOSE SAID ALICE SURPRISED AT HER OWN INGENUITY
JABBERWOCKY LET'S HEAR IT SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY I CAN EXPLAIN ALL THE POEMS THAT WERE EVER INVENTED
WHOLE LIFE'S HISTORY PRINTED ON IT EVEN THE MOST SECRET
AND ALICE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE MESSENGER FOR ANYTHING BUT HE WAS VERY STIFF AND PROUD HE SAID YOU NEEDN'T SHOUT SO LOUD
I HAVEN'T INDEED ALICE SAID VERY GENTLY IT'S IN A BOOK AH WELL THEY MAY WRITE SUCH THINGS IN A BOOK HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN A CALMER TONE
WITH PROPER ASSISTANCE YOU MIGHT HAVE LEFT OFF AT SEVEN
SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY STRETCHING OUT ONE OF HIS GREAT HANDS
I WENT AND SHOUTED IN HIS EAR HUMPTY DUMPTY RAISED HIS VOICE ALMOST TO A SCREAM
BUT GLORY DOESN'T MEAN A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT ALICE OBJECTED WHEN I USE A WORD HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID IN RATHER A SCORNFUL TONE
SAID ALICE NOT WISHING TO BEGIN AN ARGUMENT WHY
I WAS ALWAYS A FINE STARCHED UP GENTLEMAN I HAD BOTH A BOOT JACK AND A HAIR COMB
I AM QUITE CHANGED I BEGIN TO UNFOLD MYSELF YOU WILL BURN A HOLE IN ME OH I OFFER YOU MY HAND RAG SAID THE BOX IRON
I LIKE BIRTHDAY PRESENTS BEST SHE SAID AT LAST
CRIED HUMPTY DUMPTY
THE LITTLE FISHES OF THE SEA THEY SENT AN ANSWER BACK TO ME
BUT THE COLLAR THE MOST FOR HE WAS A REAL BOASTER I HAVE HAD SUCH AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF SWEETHEARTS SAID THE COLLAR I COULD NOT BE IN PEACE IT IS TRUE
AND A BEAUTIFUL ONE AS YOU SAY IT'S A PRESENT FROM THE WHITE KING AND QUEEN THERE NOW IS IT REALLY SAID ALICE QUITE PLEASED TO FIND THAT SHE HAD
CERTAINLY SAID ALICE
I SEE YOU DON'T SAID ALICE
FIT FOR THE DEED I HAD TO DO MY HEART WENT HOP MY HEART WENT THUMP I FILLED THE KETTLE AT THE PUMP THEN SOME ONE CAME TO ME AND SAID
THERE'S ANOTHER PORTMANTEAU FOR YOU
AND A LONG WAY BEYOND IT ON EACH SIDE ALICE ADDED EXACTLY SO
BUT TELL ME YOUR NAME AND YOUR BUSINESS MY NAME IS ALICE BUT IT'S A STUPID ENOUGH NAME HUMPTY DUMPTY INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY
SHE NEVER FINISHED THE SENTENCE FOR AT THIS MOMENT
WHEN HE DID SPEAK AGAIN IT WAS IN A DEEP GROWL
SHE CORRECTED HERSELF ON SECOND THOUGHTS A BEAUTIFUL CRAVAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID
EXCLAIMED THE COLLAR NOW THERE WAS NO OTHER TO COURT AND SO HE DESPISED IT A LONG TIME PASSED AWAY THEN THE COLLAR CAME INTO THE RAG CHEST AT THE PAPER MILL
I'M AFRAID I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID ALICE IT GETS EASIER FURTHER ON HUMPTY DUMPTY REPLIED I SENT TO THEM AGAIN TO SAY
I'M NOT PROUD YOU MAY SHAKE HANDS WITH ME
BUT I AM EXTREMELY SORRY FOR THE GARTER I MEAN THE GIRDLE THAT WENT INTO THE WATER TUB I HAVE MUCH ON MY CONSCIENCE I WANT TO BECOME WHITE PAPER
SHE ADDED HOPING TO TURN HER REMARK INTO A SORT OF A COMPLIMENT SOME PEOPLE SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY LOOKING AWAY FROM HER AS USUAL HAVE NO MORE SENSE THAN A BABY
ALICE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS IT WASN'T AT ALL LIKE CONVERSATION SHE THOUGHT AS HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HER IN FACT HIS LAST REMARK WAS
THAT I SHALL NOT TELL YOU SAID THE GARTER
GYROSCOPE TO GIMBLE
AND THEY PUT ME OUT I SENT A MESSAGE TO THE FISH I TOLD THEM
AS HIS EYES WERE STEADILY FIXED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND HE DIDN'T TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF HER SHE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A STUFFED FIGURE AFTER ALL
ALICE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO SAY ANYTHING SO AFTER A MINUTE HUMPTY DUMPTY BEGAN AGAIN THEY'VE A TEMPER SOME OF THEM
HOW OLD ARE YOU ALICE EXPLAINED IF I'D MEANT THAT
AN UNCOMFORTABLE SORT OF AGE NOW IF YOU'D ASKED MY ADVICE I'D HAVE SAID LEAVE OFF AT SEVEN BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW
HE WENT ON WITHOUT NOTICING HER REMARK WAS WRITTEN ENTIRELY FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT
WHEN SHE HAD COME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF IT SHE SAW THAT IT HAD EYES AND A NOSE AND MOUTH AND WHEN SHE HAD COME CLOSE TO IT SHE SAW
IN SUMMER WHEN THE DAYS ARE LONG PERHAPS YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THE SONG IN AUTUMN WHEN THE LEAVES ARE BROWN TAKE PEN AND INK
YOU'RE SO EXACTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THE FACE IS WHAT ONE GOES BY GENERALLY ALICE REMARKED IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE THAT'S JUST WHAT I COMPLAIN OF
MAYHAP YOU'LL NEVER SEE SUCH ANOTHER
TO BE SURE I WAS HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID GAILY AS SHE TURNED IT ROUND FOR HIM I THOUGHT IT LOOKED A LITTLE QUEER AS I WAS SAYING THAT SEEMS TO BE DONE RIGHT
SHE WAS A GIRDLE SO FINE SO SOFT AND SO CHARMING SHE THREW HERSELF INTO A TUB OF WATER FOR MY SAKE
HUMPTY DUMPTY HOWEVER THE EGG ONLY GOT LARGER AND LARGER
AND KICKED AND KNOCKED AND WHEN I FOUND THE DOOR WAS SHUT I TRIED TO TURN THE HANDLE BUT THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE IS THAT ALL ALICE TIMIDLY ASKED
THERE ARE TWO MEANINGS PACKED UP INTO ONE WORD I SEE IT NOW ALICE REMARKED THOUGHTFULLY AND WHAT ARE TOVES
AND IT BECAME SO
OF COURSE I DON'T THINK SO WHY IF
WAS NOT TRUE FOR IT WAS HIS MASTER WHO HAD THEM BUT HE BOASTED DON'T COME SO NEAR ME SAID THE GARTER
HOW WELL YOU CAN STRETCH YOUR LEGS OUT IT IS THE MOST GRACEFUL PERFORMANCE I HAVE EVER SEEN
LET'S GO BACK TO THE LAST REMARK BUT ONE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER IT ALICE SAID VERY POLITELY IN THAT CASE WE START FRESH
ARE SOMETHING LIKE BADGERS
HIM AND THEN HE WAS CONDEMNED I SHALL NOW BE OBLIGED TO ASK THE HAIR COMB IT IS SURPRISING HOW WELL YOU PRESERVE YOUR TEETH MISS SAID THE COLLAR
IN I TOLD THEM ONCE I TOLD THEM TWICE THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ADVICE I TOOK A KETTLE LARGE AND NEW
HOW OLD DID YOU SAY YOU WERE ALICE MADE A SHORT CALCULATION AND SAID SEVEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS WRONG
HIS LEGS CROSSED LIKE A TURK ON THE TOP OF A HIGH WALL SUCH A NARROW ONE THAT ALICE QUITE WONDERED HOW HE COULD KEEP HIS BALANCE AND
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR DAYS WHEN YOU MIGHT GET
AND THE MOME RATHS
THEN CAME THE WARM BOX IRON
ALICE ASKED DOUBTFULLY OF COURSE IT MUST HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID WITH A SHORT LAUGH MY NAME MEANS THE SHAPE I AM
I'M NOT CERTAIN ABOUT I THINK IT'S SHORT FOR FROM HOME MEANING THAT THEY'D LOST THEIR WAY YOU KNOW AND WHAT DOES OUTGRABE MEAN WELL
IF HE SMILED MUCH MORE THE ENDS OF HIS MOUTH MIGHT MEET BEHIND SHE THOUGHT AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HIS HEAD I'M AFRAID IT WOULD COME OFF
NEVER HAPPENED TO IT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO BEWARE
AND SHE BEWAILED IT AS EXCEEDINGLY UNLUCKY THAT THE LADIES SHOULD HAPPEN TO GO AWAY JUST AS THEY WERE ALL GETTING SO INTIMATE TOGETHER AFTER LAMENTING IT HOWEVER AT SOME LENGTH
AND HER ASTONISHMENT WAS CONSEQUENTLY SO GREAT AS TO OVERCOME AT FIRST THE BOUNDS OF DECORUM AND SHE COULD NOT HELP CRYING OUT ENGAGED TO MISTER COLLINS
THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED A SHEET OF ELEGANT LITTLE HOT PRESSED PAPER WELL COVERED WITH A LADY'S FAIR FLOWING HAND AND ELIZABETH SAW HER SISTER'S COUNTENANCE CHANGE AS SHE READ IT
THE BENNETS WERE ENGAGED TO DINE WITH THE LUCASES AND AGAIN DURING THE CHIEF OF THE DAY WAS MISS LUCAS SO KIND AS TO LISTEN TO MISTER COLLINS ELIZABETH TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING HER
SIR YOU QUITE MISUNDERSTAND ME SAID MISSUS BENNET ALARMED LIZZY IS ONLY HEADSTRONG IN SUCH MATTERS AS THESE IN EVERYTHING ELSE SHE IS AS GOOD NATURED A GIRL AS EVER LIVED
THE STRANGENESS OF MISTER COLLINS'S MAKING TWO OFFERS OF MARRIAGE WITHIN THREE DAYS WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON OF HIS BEING NOW ACCEPTED SHE HAD ALWAYS FELT THAT CHARLOTTE'S OPINION OF MATRIMONY WAS NOT EXACTLY LIKE HER OWN
I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF UNDERSTANDING YOU SAID HE
TO WHICH MISS BINGLEY LOOKS FORWARD MAY ARRIVE EARLIER THAN SHE IS AWARE AND THAT THE DELIGHTFUL INTERCOURSE YOU HAVE KNOWN AS FRIENDS WILL BE RENEWED WITH YET GREATER SATISFACTION AS SISTERS MISTER BINGLEY WILL NOT BE DETAINED IN LONDON BY THEM
FOR THE CURIOSITY EXCITED BY HIS LONG ABSENCE BURST FORTH IN SUCH VERY DIRECT QUESTIONS ON HIS RETURN AS REQUIRED SOME INGENUITY TO EVADE AND HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME EXERCISING GREAT SELF DENIAL
MISTER COLLINS WAS ALSO IN THE SAME STATE OF ANGRY PRIDE ELIZABETH HAD HOPED THAT HIS RESENTMENT MIGHT SHORTEN HIS VISIT BUT HIS PLAN DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY IT HE WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE GONE ON SATURDAY
WHEN I CALL CHARLES MOST CAPABLE OF ENGAGING ANY WOMAN'S HEART WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOUR AN ATTACHMENT AND NOTHING TO PREVENT IT AM I WRONG MY DEAREST JANE
ELIZABETH PASSED QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM JANE AND KITTY FOLLOWED BUT LYDIA STOOD HER GROUND DETERMINED TO HEAR ALL SHE COULD AND CHARLOTTE
I WILL HAVE NO RESERVES FROM YOU
STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND BE SATISFIED THAT WE SHALL TAKE NO OFFENCE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MY GRATITUDE IS WARMLY EXCITED BY SUCH AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION
BUT STILL HE WOULD BE HER HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING HIGHLY EITHER OF MEN OR MATRIMONY MARRIAGE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER OBJECT
IF THEREFORE SHE ACTUALLY PERSISTS IN REJECTING MY SUIT PERHAPS IT WERE BETTER NOT TO FORCE HER INTO ACCEPTING ME BECAUSE IF LIABLE TO SUCH DEFECTS OF TEMPER SHE COULD NOT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO MY FELICITY
IN AS SHORT A TIME AS MISTER COLLINS'S LONG SPEECHES WOULD ALLOW EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED BETWEEN THEM TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE
MISTER COLLINS MEANWHILE WAS MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE ON WHAT HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT TOO WELL OF HIMSELF TO COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVES HIS COUSIN COULD REFUSE HIM AND THOUGH HIS PRIDE WAS HURT
MY DEAR MADAM REPLIED HE LET US BE FOR EVER SILENT ON THIS POINT FAR BE IT FROM ME HE PRESENTLY CONTINUED
AND SAW HER DWELLING INTENTLY ON SOME PARTICULAR PASSAGES JANE RECOLLECTED HERSELF SOON AND PUTTING THE LETTER AWAY TRIED TO JOIN WITH HER USUAL CHEERFULNESS IN THE GENERAL CONVERSATION
FOR HE WAS LONGING TO PUBLISH HIS PROSPEROUS LOVE AS HE WAS TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TOO EARLY ON THE MORROW TO SEE ANY OF THE FAMILY THE CEREMONY OF LEAVE TAKING WAS PERFORMED WHEN THE LADIES MOVED FOR THE NIGHT
WHO HAS BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS I HAVE BEEN IN EARLY PREFERMENT AND I TRUST I AM RESIGNED
WHILE THE FAMILY WERE IN THIS CONFUSION CHARLOTTE LUCAS CAME TO SPEND THE DAY WITH THEM SHE WAS MET IN THE VESTIBULE BY LYDIA WHO FLYING TO HER CRIED IN A HALF WHISPER
AND ANSWER EVERY WISH OF HER HEART THEY AGREED THAT MISSUS BENNET SHOULD ONLY HEAR OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT BEING ALARMED ON THE SCORE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT BUT EVEN THIS PARTIAL COMMUNICATION GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN
AND HIS PROSPECTS OF FUTURE WEALTH WERE EXCEEDINGLY FAIR LADY LUCAS BEGAN DIRECTLY TO CALCULATE WITH MORE INTEREST THAN THE MATTER HAD EVER EXCITED BEFORE HOW MANY YEARS LONGER MISTER BENNET WAS LIKELY TO LIVE
I HAVE CERTAINLY MEANT WELL THROUGH THE WHOLE AFFAIR MY OBJECT HAS BEEN TO SECURE AN AMIABLE COMPANION FOR MYSELF
THAN SHE ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND CONGRATULATED BOTH HIM AND HERSELF
WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUED BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON ELIZABETH WOULD WONDER AND PROBABLY WOULD BLAME HER AND THOUGH HER RESOLUTION WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN HER FEELINGS MUST BE HURT
BUT THE CASE IS THIS WE ARE NOT RICH ENOUGH OR GRAND ENOUGH FOR THEM AND SHE IS THE MORE ANXIOUS TO GET MISS DARCY FOR HER BROTHER FROM THE NOTION THAT WHEN THERE HAS BEEN ONE INTERMARRIAGE SHE MAY HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN ACHIEVING A SECOND
WHO SUFFER AS I DO FROM NERVOUS COMPLAINTS CAN HAVE NO GREAT INCLINATION FOR TALKING
AND ON PERCEIVING WHOM SHE SAID TO THE GIRLS
THAT BECAUSE MISS BINGLEY TELLS YOU HER BROTHER GREATLY ADMIRES MISS DARCY HE IS IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE LESS SENSIBLE OF YOUR MERIT THAN WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE OF YOU ON TUESDAY OR THAT IT WILL BE IN HER POWER TO PERSUADE HIM THAT INSTEAD OF BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU
AND IT WAS MOST ACCEPTABLE AS AN OCCASION OF INTRODUCING HIM TO HER FATHER AND MOTHER SOON AFTER THEIR RETURN A LETTER WAS DELIVERED TO MISS BENNET
YOUR MOTHER INSISTS UPON YOUR ACCEPTING IT IS IT NOT SO MISSUS BENNET YES OR I WILL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AN UNHAPPY ALTERNATIVE IS BEFORE YOU ELIZABETH
AND THAT SHE WISHED HER ALL IMAGINABLE HAPPINESS I SEE WHAT YOU ARE FEELING REPLIED CHARLOTTE YOU MUST BE SURPRISED VERY MUCH SURPRISED SO LATELY AS MISTER COLLINS WAS WISHING TO MARRY YOU
THAT I HAD BETTER NOT MEET MISTER DARCY THAT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM THE SAME PARTY WITH HIM FOR SO MANY HOURS TOGETHER MIGHT BE MORE THAN I COULD BEAR AND THAT SCENES MIGHT ARISE UNPLEASANT TO MORE THAN MYSELF
SHE SOON REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND CALMLY REPLIED WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED MY DEAR ELIZA
AND IF MY MANNER HAS BEEN AT ALL REPREHENSIBLE
IS HEIGHTENED INTO SOMETHING STILL MORE INTERESTING
YOU CANNOT BE TOO MUCH UPON YOUR GUARD RISK ANYTHING RATHER THAN HER DISPLEASURE AND IF YOU FIND IT LIKELY TO BE RAISED BY YOUR COMING TO US AGAIN WHICH I SHOULD THINK EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
SEEMED ALMOST AS FAR FROM POSSIBILITY
TO ELIZABETH HOWEVER HE VOLUNTARILY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NECESSITY OF HIS ABSENCE HAD BEEN SELF IMPOSED I FOUND SAID HE AS THE TIME DREW NEAR
WHY WILL YOU THINK SO IT MUST BE HIS OWN DOING HE IS HIS OWN MASTER BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW ALL I WILL READ YOU THE PASSAGE WHICH PARTICULARLY HURTS ME
HOWEVER OPENLY OR ARTFULLY SPOKEN COULD INFLUENCE A YOUNG MAN SO TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF EVERYONE SHE REPRESENTED TO HER SISTER AS FORCIBLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT SHE FELT ON THE SUBJECT
CAROLINE DECIDEDLY SAYS THAT NONE OF THE PARTY WILL RETURN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE THIS WINTER I WILL READ IT TO YOU WHEN MY BROTHER LEFT US YESTERDAY
FOR MINE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT WILL YOU HEAR IT MOST WILLINGLY YOU SHALL HAVE IT IN A FEW WORDS MISS BINGLEY SEES THAT HER BROTHER IS IN LOVE WITH YOU AND WANTS HIM TO MARRY MISS DARCY
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE DISCUSSION OF MISTER COLLINS'S OFFER WAS NOW NEARLY AT AN END AND ELIZABETH HAD ONLY TO SUFFER FROM THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS NECESSARILY ATTENDING IT
BY ENGAGING THEM TOWARDS HERSELF SUCH WAS MISS LUCAS'S SCHEME AND APPEARANCES WERE SO FAVOURABLE THAT WHEN THEY PARTED AT NIGHT
AND HOWEVER UNCERTAIN OF GIVING HAPPINESS MUST BE THEIR PLEASANTEST PRESERVATIVE FROM WANT THIS PRESERVATIVE SHE HAD NOW OBTAINED AND AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN
BUT BY STIFFNESS OF MANNER AND RESENTFUL SILENCE HE SCARCELY EVER SPOKE TO HER AND THE ASSIDUOUS ATTENTIONS WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO SENSIBLE OF HIMSELF WERE TRANSFERRED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TO MISS LUCAS
WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN HANDSOME SHE FELT ALL THE GOOD LUCK OF IT THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE BUSINESS WAS THE SURPRISE IT MUST OCCASION TO ELIZABETH BENNET
HER REFLECTIONS WERE IN GENERAL SATISFACTORY MISTER COLLINS TO BE SURE WAS NEITHER SENSIBLE NOR AGREEABLE HIS SOCIETY WAS IRKSOME AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MUST BE IMAGINARY
MY CONDUCT MAY I FEAR BE OBJECTIONABLE IN HAVING ACCEPTED MY DISMISSION FROM YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIPS INSTEAD OF YOUR OWN BUT WE ARE ALL LIABLE TO ERROR
OF MY ROOM I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE THE LIBRARY TO MYSELF AS SOON AS MAY BE NOT YET HOWEVER IN SPITE OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER HUSBAND DID MISSUS BENNET GIVE UP THE POINT
AS FOR MY FAIR COUSINS THOUGH MY ABSENCE MAY NOT BE LONG ENOUGH TO RENDER IT NECESSARY
EVEN SUPPOSING THE BEST IN ACCEPTING A MAN WHOSE SISTERS AND FRIENDS ARE ALL WISHING HIM TO MARRY ELSEWHERE YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF SAID ELIZABETH
MISTER COLLINS RECEIVED AND RETURNED THESE FELICITATIONS WITH EQUAL PLEASURE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO RELATE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR INTERVIEW WITH THE RESULT OF WHICH HE TRUSTED HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED
AND HAD SOON THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ITS HAPPY EFFECT JANE'S TEMPER WAS NOT DESPONDING AND SHE WAS GRADUALLY LED TO HOPE THOUGH THE DIFFIDENCE OF AFFECTION SOMETIMES OVERCAME THE HOPE THAT BINGLEY WOULD RETURN TO NETHERFIELD
AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH WE ARE SCARCELY LESS EAGER TO MEET HER AGAIN I REALLY DO NOT THINK GEORGIANA DARCY HAS HER EQUAL FOR BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE AFFECTION SHE INSPIRES IN LOUISA AND MYSELF
I AM CONVINCED THAT MY CHANCE OF HAPPINESS WITH HIM IS AS FAIR AS MOST PEOPLE CAN BOAST ON ENTERING THE MARRIAGE STATE ELIZABETH QUIETLY ANSWERED UNDOUBTEDLY AND AFTER AN AWKWARD PAUSE
RELATED THE EVENT OF THE DAY BEFORE THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTER COLLINS'S FANCYING HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER FRIEND HAD ONCE OCCURRED TO ELIZABETH WITHIN THE LAST DAY OR TWO BUT THAT CHARLOTTE COULD ENCOURAGE HIM
SINCE THE REFUSAL WHICH HIS COUSIN HAD STEADFASTLY GIVEN HIM WOULD NATURALLY FLOW FROM HER BASHFUL MODESTY AND THE GENUINE DELICACY OF HER CHARACTER THIS INFORMATION HOWEVER STARTLED MISSUS BENNET
AND IF UPON MATURE DELIBERATION YOU FIND THAT THE MISERY OF DISOBLIGING HIS TWO SISTERS IS MORE THAN EQUIVALENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF BEING HIS WIFE I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO REFUSE HIM
SHE IS A VERY HEADSTRONG FOOLISH GIRL AND DOES NOT KNOW HER OWN INTEREST BUT I WILL MAKE HER KNOW IT PARDON ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MADAM CRIED MISTER COLLINS
AND YOU MAY BE VERY CERTAIN THAT I SHALL AVAIL MYSELF OF IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED AND MISTER BENNET WHO COULD BY NO MEANS WISH FOR SO SPEEDY A RETURN
BUT HERE SHE DID INJUSTICE TO THE FIRE AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS CHARACTER FOR IT LED HIM TO ESCAPE OUT OF LONGBOURN HOUSE THE NEXT MORNING WITH ADMIRABLE SLYNESS AND HASTEN TO LUCAS LODGE TO THROW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
HE WILL HAVE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SEEING HER ON THE MOST INTIMATE FOOTING HER RELATIONS ALL WISH THE CONNECTION AS MUCH AS HIS OWN AND A SISTER'S PARTIALITY IS NOT MISLEADING ME I THINK
AND MISSUS BENNET WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CORDIALITY SAID HOW HAPPY THEY SHOULD BE TO SEE HIM AT LONGBOURN AGAIN
I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME FOR THERE IS SUCH FUN HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED THIS MORNING
SHE TALKED TO ELIZABETH AGAIN AND AGAIN COAXED AND THREATENED HER BY TURNS SHE ENDEAVOURED TO SECURE JANE IN HER INTEREST BUT JANE WITH ALL POSSIBLE MILDNESS DECLINED INTERFERING
I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN TALKING TO UNDUTIFUL CHILDREN
SHE ADDED THAT LIZZY SHALL BE BROUGHT TO REASON
BUT IF SHE IS REALLY HEADSTRONG AND FOOLISH I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE WOULD ALTOGETHER BE A VERY DESIRABLE WIFE TO A MAN IN MY SITUATION WHO NATURALLY LOOKS FOR HAPPINESS IN THE MARRIAGE STATE
IS THAT SHE IS DECEIVING HERSELF THAT IS RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE STARTED A MORE HAPPY IDEA SINCE YOU WILL NOT TAKE COMFORT IN MINE BELIEVE HER TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL MEANS
HE IMAGINED THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TO LONDON MIGHT BE CONCLUDED IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN IT CANNOT BE SO AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVINCED THAT WHEN CHARLES GETS TO TOWN HE WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE IT AGAIN
MISTER COLLINS WAS NOT LEFT LONG TO THE SILENT CONTEMPLATION OF HIS SUCCESSFUL LOVE FOR MISSUS BENNET HAVING DAWDLED ABOUT IN THE VESTIBULE TO WATCH FOR THE END OF THE CONFERENCE NO SOONER SAW ELIZABETH OPEN THE DOOR
DETAINED FIRST BY THE CIVILITY OF MISTER COLLINS WHOSE INQUIRIES AFTER HERSELF AND ALL HER FAMILY WERE VERY MINUTE AND THEN BY A LITTLE CURIOSITY SATISFIED HERSELF WITH WALKING TO THE WINDOW AND PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR
SHE RESOLVED TO GIVE HER THE INFORMATION HERSELF AND THEREFORE CHARGED MISTER COLLINS WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONGBOURN TO DINNER TO DROP NO HINT OF WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE ANY OF THE FAMILY
FROM THIS DAY YOU MUST BE A STRANGER TO ONE OF YOUR PARENTS YOUR MOTHER WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT MARRY MISTER COLLINS AND I WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO
IN INDULGING THE HOPE OF AN EVENT WHICH WILL SECURE THE HAPPINESS OF SO MANY
MISS LUCAS PERCEIVED HIM FROM AN UPPER WINDOW AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND INSTANTLY SET OUT TO MEET HIM ACCIDENTALLY IN THE LANE BUT LITTLE HAD SHE DARED TO HOPE THAT SO MUCH LOVE AND ELOQUENCE AWAITED HER THERE
HAD MY FAIR COUSIN HONOURED ME WITH HER HAND FOR I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT RESIGNATION IS NEVER SO PERFECT AS WHEN THE BLESSING DENIED BEGINS TO LOSE SOMEWHAT OF ITS VALUE IN OUR ESTIMATION
HE WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID THE NOTICE OF HIS COUSINS FROM A CONVICTION THAT IF THEY SAW HIM DEPART THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO CONJECTURE HIS DESIGN
HER MISTER BENNET RAISED HIS EYES FROM HIS BOOK AS SHE ENTERED AND FIXED THEM ON HER FACE WITH A CALM UNCONCERN WHICH WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALTERED BY HER COMMUNICATION
WITHOUT HAVING PAID YOURSELF AND MISTER BENNET THE COMPLIMENT OF REQUESTING YOU TO INTERPOSE YOUR AUTHORITY IN MY BEHALF
FOR THOUGH FEELING ALMOST SECURE AND WITH REASON FOR CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN TOLERABLY ENCOURAGING HE WAS COMPARATIVELY DIFFIDENT SINCE THE ADVENTURE OF WEDNESDAY HIS RECEPTION HOWEVER WAS OF THE MOST FLATTERING KIND
NO ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN YOU TOGETHER CAN DOUBT HIS AFFECTION MISS BINGLEY I AM SURE CANNOT SHE IS NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HALF AS MUCH LOVE IN MISTER DARCY FOR HERSELF
THERE WAS A SOLIDITY IN HIS REFLECTIONS WHICH OFTEN STRUCK HER AND THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO CLEVER AS HERSELF SHE THOUGHT THAT IF ENCOURAGED TO READ AND IMPROVE HIMSELF BY SUCH AN EXAMPLE AS HERS
AND ATTENDED THEM TO THEIR AUNT'S WHERE HIS REGRET AND VEXATION AND THE CONCERN OF EVERYBODY
CAROLINE IS INCAPABLE OF WILFULLY DECEIVING ANYONE
WHO ACCEPTED HIM SOLELY FROM THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED DESIRE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT CARED NOT HOW SOON THAT ESTABLISHMENT WERE GAINED SIR WILLIAM AND LADY LUCAS WERE SPEEDILY APPLIED TO FOR THEIR CONSENT
THE STEADY COUNTENANCE WHICH MISS LUCAS HAD COMMANDED IN TELLING HER STORY GAVE WAY TO A MOMENTARY CONFUSION HERE ON RECEIVING SO DIRECT A REPROACH THOUGH AS IT WAS NO MORE THAN SHE EXPECTED
MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
BUT ELIZABETH FELT AN ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH DREW OFF HER ATTENTION EVEN FROM WICKHAM AND NO SOONER HAD HE AND HIS COMPANION TAKEN LEAVE THAN A GLANCE FROM JANE INVITED HER TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE I AM NOT ROMANTIC YOU KNOW I NEVER WAS I ASK ONLY A COMFORTABLE HOME AND CONSIDERING MISTER COLLINS'S CHARACTER
SHE FOLLOWS HIM TO TOWN IN HOPE OF KEEPING HIM THERE AND TRIES TO PERSUADE YOU THAT HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU JANE SHOOK HER HEAD INDEED JANE YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE ME
AS TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING THE LOSS OF THE THREE OF WHOM WE SHALL DEPRIVE YOU IT IS EVIDENT BY THIS ADDED JANE THAT HE COMES BACK NO MORE THIS WINTER
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO BE EQUALLY SATISFIED THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD MEANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY PROTESTING AGAINST HIS PROPOSALS BUT SHE DARED NOT BELIEVE IT
IT KEEPS HIM IN GOOD HUMOUR SAID SHE AND I AM MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN I CAN EXPRESS CHARLOTTE ASSURED HER FRIEND OF HER SATISFACTION IN BEING USEFUL
AND ELIZABETH SOMETIMES WITH REAL EARNESTNESS AND SOMETIMES WITH PLAYFUL GAIETY REPLIED TO HER ATTACKS THOUGH HER MANNER VARIED HOWEVER HER DETERMINATION NEVER DID
BUT IT IS ALWAYS SO THOSE WHO DO NOT COMPLAIN ARE NEVER PITIED HER DAUGHTERS LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THIS EFFUSION
WHO CAME TO TELL THE SAME NEWS AND NO SOONER HAD THEY ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE MISSUS BENNET WAS ALONE THAN SHE LIKEWISE BEGAN ON THE SUBJECT CALLING ON MISS LUCAS FOR HER COMPASSION
THAT WHEN CALLED INTO ACTION SHE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED EVERY BETTER FEELING TO WORLDLY ADVANTAGE CHARLOTTE THE WIFE OF MISTER COLLINS WAS A MOST HUMILIATING PICTURE
AND OCCASIONALLY FROM SOME PEEVISH ALLUSIONS OF HER MOTHER AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF HIS FEELINGS WERE CHIEFLY EXPRESSED NOT BY EMBARRASSMENT OR DEJECTION OR BY TRYING TO AVOID HER
MY DEAR MADAM HE REPLIED THIS INVITATION IS PARTICULARLY GRATIFYING BECAUSE IT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN HOPING TO RECEIVE
AND THE BOYS WERE RELIEVED FROM THEIR APPREHENSION OF CHARLOTTE'S DYING AN OLD MAID CHARLOTTE HERSELF WAS TOLERABLY COMPOSED SHE HAD GAINED HER POINT AND HAD TIME TO CONSIDER OF IT
THE IDEA OF HIS RETURNING NO MORE ELIZABETH TREATED WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT IT APPEARED TO HER MERELY THE SUGGESTION OF CAROLINE'S INTERESTED WISHES AND SHE COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSE THAT THOSE WISHES
THE WHOLE FAMILY IN SHORT WERE PROPERLY OVERJOYED ON THE OCCASION THE YOUNGER GIRLS FORMED HOPES OF COMING OUT A YEAR OR TWO SOONER THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE DONE
AND THAT IF SHE SUSPECTS THE NATURE OF MY FEELINGS FOR HIM SHE MEANS MOST KINDLY TO PUT ME ON MY GUARD CAN THERE BE ANY OTHER OPINION ON THE SUBJECT YES THERE CAN
SHE ADDED IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
IN A VOICE THAT MARKED HIS DISPLEASURE TO RESENT THE BEHAVIOUR OF YOUR DAUGHTER RESIGNATION TO INEVITABLE EVILS IS THE DUTY OF US ALL THE PECULIAR DUTY OF A YOUNG MAN
WOULD ONLY INCREASE THE IRRITATION SHE TALKED ON THEREFORE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FROM ANY OF THEM TILL THEY WERE JOINED BY MISTER COLLINS
AND SOON DINING AT LONGBOURN AND THE CONCLUSION OF ALL WAS THE COMFORTABLE DECLARATION THAT THOUGH HE HAD BEEN INVITED ONLY TO A FAMILY DINNER SHE WOULD TAKE CARE TO HAVE TWO FULL COURSES
IT IS UNLUCKY SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT PAUSE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT MAY WE NOT HOPE THAT THE PERIOD OF FUTURE HAPPINESS
AND THAT IT AMPLY REPAID HER FOR THE LITTLE SACRIFICE OF HER TIME THIS WAS VERY AMIABLE BUT CHARLOTTE'S KINDNESS EXTENDED FARTHER THAN ELIZABETH HAD ANY CONCEPTION OF
THE STUPIDITY WITH WHICH HE WAS FAVOURED BY NATURE MUST GUARD HIS COURTSHIP FROM ANY CHARM THAT COULD MAKE A WOMAN WISH FOR ITS CONTINUANCE AND MISS LUCAS
NOT EXCEPTING MY COUSIN ELIZABETH WITH PROPER CIVILITIES THE LADIES THEN WITHDREW
SAID JANE AS SHE FINISHED IT IS IT NOT CLEAR ENOUGH DOES IT NOT EXPRESSLY DECLARE THAT CAROLINE NEITHER EXPECTS NOR WISHES ME TO BE HER SISTER THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HER BROTHER'S INDIFFERENCE
IMMEDIATELY SAID BUT IS THERE NOT DANGER OF LADY CATHERINE'S DISAPPROBATION HERE MY GOOD SIR YOU HAD BETTER NEGLECT YOUR RELATIONS THAN RUN THE RISK OF OFFENDING YOUR PATRONESS MY DEAR SIR
AFTER BREAKFAST THE GIRLS WALKED TO MERYTON TO INQUIRE IF MISTER WICKHAM WERE RETURNED AND TO LAMENT OVER HIS ABSENCE FROM THE NETHERFIELD BALL HE JOINED THEM ON THEIR ENTERING THE TOWN
MAY BE HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM THE RANGE THEY CROP OUT LIKE THAT SUDDENLY WE LEFT THE LAKE AND STRUCK DIRECTLY TOWARD THE CLIFFS WE HEARD RUNNING WATER BEFORE WE REACHED IT AND THE GUIDE POINTED PROUDLY TO HIS RIVER IT WAS SHORT
TERRY'S SMILE WAS IRREPROACHABLE BUT I DID NOT LIKE THE LOOK IN HIS EYES IT WAS LIKE A CREATURE ABOUT TO SPRING I COULD ALREADY SEE IT HAPPEN THE DROPPED NECKLACE THE SUDDEN CLUTCHING HAND THE GIRL'S SHARP CRY AS HE SEIZED HER AND DREW HER IN BUT IT
SO WE JOKED AND DISPUTED AND SPECULATED AND AFTER AN INTERMINABLE JOURNEY WE GOT TO OUR OLD CAMPING PLACE AT LAST
YOU'LL FIND IT'S BUILT ON A SORT OF MATRIARCHAL PRINCIPLE THAT'S ALL
IT WAS ONLY A RAG A LONG RAVELED FRAGMENT OF CLOTH BUT IT WAS A WELL WOVEN FABRIC WITH A PATTERN AND OF A CLEAR SCARLET THAT THE WATER HAD NOT FADED
WITH YOUR TREMENDOUS SPEED WE CAN REACH THAT RANGE AND BACK ALL RIGHT THEN WE CAN LEAVE A SORT OF
DIDN'T HAPPEN SHE MADE A TIMID REACH WITH HER RIGHT HAND FOR THE GAY SWINGING THING HE HELD IT A LITTLE NEARER THEN SWIFT AS LIGHT SHE SEIZED IT FROM HIM WITH HER LEFT AND DROPPED ON THE INSTANT TO THE BOUGH BELOW HE MADE HIS SNATCH QUITE VAINLY
HE CRIED SOFTLY IN RESTRAINED ENTHUSIASM I NEVER SAW A FOREST SO PETTED EVEN IN
DANGER ENOUGH TERRY AND WE'LL HAVE TO BE MIGHTY CAREFUL WOMEN OF THAT STAGE OF CULTURE ARE QUITE ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND HAVE NO WELCOME FOR UNSEASONABLE VISITORS WE TALKED AND TALKED AND WITH ALL MY AIRS OF SOCIOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY
THERE AMONG THE BOUGHS OVERHEAD WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN ONE SOMETHING THAT CLUNG MOTIONLESS CLOSE TO THE GREAT TRUNK AT FIRST AND THEN AS ONE AND ALL WE STARTED UP THE TREE
WE CAME AFTER A WHILE TO A SORT OF MARSHY LAKE VERY BIG SO THAT THE CIRCLING FOREST LOOKED QUITE LOW AND DIM ACROSS IT OUR GUIDE TOLD US THAT BOATS COULD GO FROM THERE TO OUR CAMP BUT LONG WAY ALL DAY
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US IN COLLEGE DAYS WAS QUITE PLEASED TO HAVE HIM WITH OUR SISTERS WE WEREN'T VERY STRINGENT HEAVENS NO BUT TERRY WAS THE LIMIT LATER ON WHY OF COURSE A MAN'S LIFE IS HIS OWN
SAVAGE DIALECTS STUDIED AND ALL MANNER OF STRANGE FLORA AND FAUNA EXPECTED BUT THIS STORY IS NOT ABOUT THAT EXPEDITION THAT WAS ONLY THE MEREST STARTER FOR OURS
THAT THERE WAS THIS STRANGE COUNTRY WHERE NO MEN LIVED ONLY WOMEN AND GIRL CHILDREN NONE OF THEM HAD EVER SEEN IT IT WAS DANGEROUS DEADLY THEY SAID FOR ANY MAN TO GO THERE
IT WAS QUITE EASY TO SEE AFTERWARD THAT OUR BEST PLAN WAS TO HAVE STUDIED THE COUNTRY MORE FULLY BEFORE WE LEFT OUR SWOOPING AIRSHIP AND TRUSTED OURSELVES TO MERE FOOT SERVICE BUT WE WERE THREE YOUNG MEN
A LITTLE HAPPY SOUND INSTANTLY SMOTHERED WE STOOD LIKE SO MANY POINTERS AND THEN USED OUR GLASSES SWIFTLY CAREFULLY
THE REST OF THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT COUNTRY I HAVEN'T SAID WHERE IT WAS FOR FEAR SOME SELF APPOINTED MISSIONARIES OR TRADERS OR LAND GREEDY EXPANSIONISTS WILL TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PUSH IN THEY WILL NOT BE WANTED I CAN TELL THEM THAT
A FINE CHEST HE HAD TOO AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF HE WAS BRACED CAREFULLY FOR THE OCCASION AND ACHIEVED AN EXCELLENT OBEISANCE AGAIN THEY LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY AND THE ONE NEAREST ME FOLLOWED HIS TACTICS
LOOKING AT THE LONG BLUE ROLLERS SLIPPING BY AND FINGERING THAT IMPRESSIVE MUSTACHE OF HIS BUT I THOUGHT THEN THAT I COULD FORM A FAR CLEARER IDEA OF WHAT WAS BEFORE US THAN EITHER OF THEM YOU'RE ALL OFF BOYS I INSISTED
I ALSO TRIED TO MAKE AN EFFECTIVE SALUTE AND NEARLY LOST MY BALANCE
THE GROUND GROWING FIRMER AS WE ADVANCED AND PRESENTLY WE TURNED THE CORNER OF A WOODED PROMONTORY AND SAW A QUITE DIFFERENT COUNTRY A SUDDEN VIEW OF MOUNTAINS STEEP AND BARE ONE OF THOSE LONG EASTERLY SPURS TERRY SAID APPRAISINGLY
A PUNITIVE EXPEDITION I URGED IF THE LADIES DO EAT US WE MUST MAKE REPRISALS
AND PUMPED THE MAN FOR FURTHER INFORMATION HE COULD TELL US ONLY WHAT THE OTHERS HAD A LAND OF WOMEN NO MEN BABIES BUT ALL GIRLS NO PLACE FOR MEN DANGEROUS SOME HAD GONE TO SEE NONE HAD COME BACK
JEFF MARGRAVE AND I VANDYCK JENNINGS WE HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER YEARS AND YEARS AND IN SPITE OF OUR DIFFERENCES WE HAD A GOOD DEAL IN COMMON ALL OF US WERE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE TERRY WAS RICH ENOUGH TO DO AS HE PLEASED
AS FOR ME SOCIOLOGY'S MY MAJOR YOU HAVE TO BACK THAT UP WITH A LOT OF OTHER SCIENCES OF COURSE
THEY HEARD OUR WHIRRING SCREW THEY RAN OUT OF THE HOUSES THEY GATHERED IN FROM THE FIELDS SWIFT RUNNING LIGHT FIGURES CROWDS OF THEM WE STARED AND STARED UNTIL IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE TO CATCH THE LEVERS SWEEP OFF AND RISE AGAIN
SO I SHOWED HIM A RED AND BLUE PENCIL I CARRIED AND ASKED AGAIN YES HE POINTED TO THE RIVER AND THEN TO THE SOUTHWESTWARD RIVER GOOD WATER RED AND BLUE
THERE IS NO SUCH CLOTH MADE BY ANY OF THESE LOCAL TRIBES I ANNOUNCED EXAMINING THOSE RAGS WITH GREAT CARE SOMEWHERE UP YONDER THEY SPIN AND WEAVE AND DYE AS WELL AS WE DO THAT WOULD MEAN A CONSIDERABLE CIVILIZATION VAN
THE EXPEDITION WAS UP AMONG THE THOUSAND TRIBUTARIES AND ENORMOUS HINTERLAND OF A GREAT RIVER
AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL OF THE WOMEN THEMSELVES NOBODY WILL EVER BELIEVE HOW THEY LOOKED DESCRIPTIONS AREN'T ANY GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN AND I NEVER WAS GOOD AT DESCRIPTIONS ANYHOW BUT IT'S GOT TO BE DONE SOMEHOW
ABOUT A STRANGE AND TERRIBLE WOMAN LAND IN THE HIGH DISTANCE UP YONDER OVER THERE WAY UP WAS ALL THE DIRECTION THEY COULD OFFER BUT THEIR LEGENDS ALL AGREED ON THE MAIN POINT
MY WORD THE MEN OF THIS COUNTRY MUST BE GOOD SPRINTERS INHABITANTS EVIDENTLY ARBOREAL I GRIMLY SUGGESTED CIVILIZED AND STILL ARBOREAL PECULIAR PEOPLE
BUT WE WERE TOO HIGH AND GOING TOO FAST TO SEE MUCH IT APPEARED TO BE WELL FORESTED ABOUT THE EDGES BUT IN THE INTERIOR THERE WERE WIDE PLAINS AND EVERYWHERE PARKLIKE MEADOWS AND OPEN PLACES THERE WERE CITIES TOO THAT I INSISTED
THEN THERE WAS A TORRENT OF SOFT TALK TOSSED BACK AND FORTH NO SAVAGE SING SONG BUT CLEAR MUSICAL FLUENT SPEECH WE MET THEIR LAUGHTER CORDIALLY AND DOFFED OUR HATS TO THEM AT WHICH THEY LAUGHED AGAIN
BUT THERE WERE TALES OF LONG AGO WHEN SOME BRAVE INVESTIGATOR HAD SEEN IT A BIG COUNTRY BIG HOUSES PLENTY PEOPLE ALL WOMEN HAD NO ONE ELSE GONE
NONE OF US WAS CERTAIN AT FIRST WE SAW SHORT HAIR HATLESS LOOSE AND SHINING A SUIT OF SOME LIGHT FIRM STUFF THE CLOSEST OF TUNICS AND KNEEBREECHES MET BY TRIM GAITERS
SEPARATED INTO THREE SWIFT MOVING FIGURES AND FLED UPWARD AS WE CLIMBED WE COULD CATCH GLIMPSES OF THEM SCATTERING ABOVE US BY THE TIME WE HAD REACHED ABOUT AS FAR AS THREE MEN TOGETHER DARED PUSH THEY HAD LEFT THE MAIN TRUNK AND MOVED OUTWARD
ON THEIR PRECARIOUS PERCHES AND FRANKLY CURIOUSLY STARED AT US GIRLS WHISPERED JEFF UNDER HIS BREATH
RASH ADVANCES NOT MORE THAN TEN OR FIFTEEN MILES WE JUDGED IT FROM OUR LANDING ROCK TO THAT LAST VILLAGE FOR ALL OUR EAGERNESS WE THOUGHT IT WISE TO KEEP TO THE WOODS AND GO CAREFULLY
OFFERED IT FIRST TO ONE THEN TO ANOTHER HOLDING IT OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH TOWARD THE GIRL NEAREST HIM HE STOOD BRACED IN THE FORK HELD FIRMLY BY ONE HAND THE OTHER SWINGING HIS BRIGHT TEMPTATION REACHED FAR OUT ALONG THE BOUGH
THOSE NATIVES CAN'T GET INTO IT OR HURT IT OR MOVE IT TERRY EXPLAINED PROUDLY WE'LL START OUR FLIER FROM THE LAKE AND LEAVE THE BOAT AS A BASE TO COME BACK TO IF WE COME BACK I SUGGESTED CHEERFULLY FRAID THE LADIES WILL EAT YOU HE SCOFFED
COULDN'T RISK IT HE ASSERTED SOLEMNLY YOU MIGHT START A REVOLUTION
HIS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE STOOD HIM IN GOOD STEAD THERE IT WAS A VERY COMPLETE LITTLE OUTFIT
THOUGH SOME WERE TERRIFIED ENOUGH THERE WAS GREAT BEAUTY
AS FREE FROM SUSPICION AS A CHILD'S WHO HAS NEVER BEEN REBUKED HER INTEREST WAS MORE THAT OF AN INTENT BOY PLAYING A FASCINATING GAME THAN OF A GIRL LURED BY AN ORNAMENT THE OTHERS MOVED A BIT FARTHER OUT HOLDING FIRMLY WATCHING
OF COURSE WE DIDN'T BELIEVE THE STORY
FIRST TIE YOUR CAMEL AND THEN TRUST IN THE LORD JEFF MURMURED SO WE ALL HAD OUR WEAPONS IN HAND AND STOLE CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE FOREST TERRY STUDIED IT AS WE PROGRESSED TALK OF CIVILIZATION
I SUGGESTED BUT TERRY WAS SILENT WE WERE APPROACHING A VILLAGE I CONFESS THAT WE PAID SMALL ATTENTION TO THE CLEAN WELL BUILT ROADS TO THE ATTRACTIVE ARCHITECTURE TO THE ORDERED BEAUTY OF THE LITTLE TOWN
HE BROKE OFF YOU'RE RIGHT TERRY ONCE THE STORY GETS OUT THE RIVER WILL CRAWL WITH EXPEDITIONS AND THE AIRSHIPS RISE LIKE A SWARM OF MOSQUITOES I LAUGHED AS I THOUGHT OF IT WE'VE MADE A GREAT MISTAKE NOT TO LET MISTER YELLOW PRESS IN ON THIS SAVE US
THE SAME TASTE I HAPPENED TO SPEAK OF THAT RIVER TO OUR LAST GUIDE A RATHER SUPERIOR FELLOW WITH QUICK BRIGHT EYES HE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER RIVER OVER THERE SHORT RIVER SWEET WATER RED AND BLUE
PRECIOUS FEW PEOPLE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT AND IT'S BEEN MINDING ITS OWN BUSINESS FOR A THOUSAND YEARS THEN THERE'S MONTENEGRO SPLENDID LITTLE STATE YOU COULD LOSE A DOZEN MONTENEGROES UP AND DOWN THESE GREAT RANGES WE DISCUSSED IT HOTLY ALL THE WAY BACK TO CAMP
HE PRODUCED FROM AN INNER POCKET A LITTLE BOX OF PURPLE VELVET THAT OPENED WITH A SNAP AND OUT OF IT HE DREW A LONG SPARKLING THING
HIS GREAT AIM WAS EXPLORATION HE USED TO MAKE ALL KINDS OF A ROW BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO EXPLORE NOW ONLY PATCHWORK AND FILLING IN HE SAID HE FILLED IN WELL ENOUGH HE HAD A LOT OF TALENTS GREAT ON MECHANICS AND ELECTRICITY
AND WE HAD TO GET BACK TO OUR PARTY BEFORE NIGHT
AND AS WE GOT FARTHER AND FARTHER UPSTREAM IN A DARK TANGLE OF RIVERS LAKES MORASSES AND DENSE FORESTS WITH HERE AND THERE AN UNEXPECTED LONG SPUR RUNNING OUT FROM THE BIG MOUNTAINS BEYOND I NOTICED THAT MORE AND MORE OF THESE SAVAGES HAD A STORY
FOR THAT MATTER THEY MAY LIVE UP IN THE MOUNTAINS YONDER AND KEEP THE WOMEN IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY SORT OF A NATIONAL HAREM BUT THERE ARE MEN SOMEWHERE DIDN'T YOU SEE THE BABIES WE HAD ALL SEEN BABIES CHILDREN BIG AND LITTLE
NO YOU'LL HAVE TO BE BEHEADED OR BOWSTRUNG OR WHATEVER THE POPULAR METHOD OF EXECUTION IS YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT YOURSELF REMEMBER GRINNED JEFF NO HUSKY BLACK SLAVES AND MAMELUKES
WE SCRAMBLED ALONG THE STEEP BANKS AND GOT CLOSE TO THE POOL THAT FOAMED AND BOILED BENEATH THE FALLING WATER HERE WE SEARCHED THE BORDER AND FOUND TRACES OF COLOR BEYOND DISPUTE MORE JEFF SUDDENLY HELD UP AN UNLOOKED FOR TROPHY
AND FRUIT GATHERERS BUT AN AIRSHIP IS A CONSPICUOUS OBJECT AND BY NO MEANS QUIET AND WOMEN ARE CAUTIOUS
LET'S GO URGED TERRY JUST US THREE MAYBE WE CAN REALLY FIND SOMETHING MAY BE CINNABAR IN IT MAY BE INDIGO JEFF SUGGESTED WITH HIS LAZY SMILE IT WAS EARLY YET WE HAD JUST BREAKFASTED
CHAPTER ONE A NOT UNNATURAL ENTERPRISE THIS IS WRITTEN FROM MEMORY UNFORTUNATELY IF I COULD HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME THE MATERIAL I SO CAREFULLY PREPARED THIS WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT STORY
THIS DIRECTION AND NOT FAR FROM THE WOODS AS I REMEMBER WHEN WE REACHED THE EDGE OF THE OPEN COUNTRY WE RECONNOITERED WITH OUR FIELD GLASSES THERE IT WAS ABOUT FOUR MILES OFF THE SAME TOWN WE CONCLUDED UNLESS AS JEFF VENTURED THEY ALL HAD PINK HOUSES
AND FROM WHAT WE COULD SEE OF THE SIDES AND THAT ICY RIDGE AT THE BACK END
EH VAN JEFF'S IDEAS AND TERRY'S WERE SO FAR APART THAT SOMETIMES IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO KEEP THE PEACE BETWEEN THEM JEFF IDEALIZED WOMEN IN THE BEST SOUTHERN STYLE HE WAS FULL OF CHIVALRY AND SENTIMENT AND ALL THAT AND HE WAS A GOOD BOY
THEN SOFTLY AND SLOWLY SHE DREW NEARER THIS WAS ALIMA A TALL LONG LIMBED LASS WELL KNIT AND EVIDENTLY BOTH STRONG AND AGILE HER EYES WERE SPLENDID WIDE FEARLESS
WELL TERRY WAS POPULAR AMONG WOMEN EVEN WHEN THERE WERE OTHER MEN AROUND AND IT'S NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT HE HAD PLEASANT DREAMS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN I COULD SEE IT IN HIS EYES AS HE LAY THERE
WOMAN COUNTRY UP THERE THEN WE WERE INTERESTED
AND IT WAS NAVIGABLE AS FAR AS THE LAKE WHEN WE REACHED THAT AND SLID OUT ON ITS BROAD GLISTENING BOSOM WITH THAT HIGH GRAY PROMONTORY RUNNING OUT TOWARD US AND THE STRAIGHT WHITE FALL CLEARLY VISIBLE IT BEGAN TO BE REALLY EXCITING
AND SEE THE BROAD FAIR LAND AT OUR PLEASURE SEMITROPICAL
AND WILL FARE WORSE THAN WE DID IF THEY DO FIND IT IT BEGAN THIS WAY THERE WERE THREE OF US CLASSMATES AND FRIENDS TERRY O NICHOLSON
AND IT WAS AN EXCELLENT ONE A WIDE FLAT TOPPED ROCK OVERLOOKING THE LAKE AND QUITE OUT OF SIGHT FROM THE INTERIOR THEY WON'T FIND THIS IN A HURRY HE ASSERTED AS WE SCRAMBLED WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY DOWN TO SAFER FOOTING COME ON BOYS THERE WERE SOME GOOD LOOKERS IN THAT BUNCH OF COURSE
AND LEAVING WORD THAT WE'D BE BACK BEFORE NIGHT WE GOT AWAY QUIETLY NOT WISHING TO BE THOUGHT TOO GULLIBLE IF WE FAILED AND SECRETLY HOPING TO HAVE SOME NICE LITTLE DISCOVERY ALL TO OURSELVES IT WAS A LONG TWO HOURS NEARER THREE
AS BRIGHT AND SMOOTH AS PARROTS AND AS UNAWARE OF DANGER THEY SWUNG THERE BEFORE US WHOLLY AT EASE STARING AS WE STARED TILL FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL OF THEM BURST INTO PEALS OF DELIGHTED LAUGHTER
BUT T O NICHOLSON COULD FIX UP HIS BIG STEAM YACHT LOAD HIS SPECIALLY MADE BIG MOTORBOAT ABOARD AND TUCK IN A DISSEMBLED BIPLANE WITHOUT ANY MORE NOTICE THAN A SNIP IN THE SOCIETY COLUMN WE HAD PROVISIONS AND PREVENTIVES AND ALL MANNER OF SUPPLIES
AND USED TO ARGUE LEARNEDLY ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OF THE SEX WE WERE NOT IN THE LEAST ADVANCED ON THE WOMAN QUESTION
THEY WERE PERFECTLY FRIENDLY NOW WE'VE SCARED THEM BUT IT WAS NO USE GRUMBLING AND TERRY REFUSED TO ADMIT ANY MISTAKE NONSENSE HE SAID THEY EXPECTED IT WOMEN LIKE TO BE RUN AFTER
ONLY IT WAS EVEN MORE EVIDENTLY AN ENORMOUS GARDEN
EVEN TERRY'S ARDOR WAS HELD IN CHECK BY HIS FIRM CONVICTION THAT THERE WERE MEN TO BE MET AND WE SAW TO IT THAT EACH OF US HAD A GOOD STOCK OF CARTRIDGES THEY MAY BE SCARCE AND THEY MAY BE HIDDEN AWAY SOMEWHERE SOME KIND OF
I COULD SEE TERRY'S JAW SET AT THAT NO PLACE FOR MEN DANGEROUS HE LOOKED AS IF HE MIGHT SHIN UP THE WATERFALL ON THE SPOT BUT THE GUIDE WOULD NOT HEAR OF GOING UP EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY POSSIBLE METHOD OF SCALING THAT SHEER CLIFF
BUT AS TO BEING RED AND BLUE IT WAS GREENISH IN TINT THE GUIDE SEEMED NOT AT ALL SURPRISED HE HUNTED ABOUT A LITTLE AND SHOWED US A QUIET MARGINAL POOL WHERE THERE WERE SMEARS OF RED ALONG THE BORDER YES AND OF BLUE
NOW WE HAD NO EAVESDROPPERS WE COULD LOLL AND LOAF IN OUR DECK CHAIRS AND TALK AND TALK THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO
IF YOU DO JEFF ASKED MILDLY JEFF WAS A TENDER SOUL I THINK HE THOUGHT THAT COUNTRY IF THERE WAS ONE WAS JUST
MY INTEREST WAS FIRST ROUSED BY TALK AMONG OUR GUIDES I'M QUICK AT LANGUAGES KNOW A GOOD MANY AND PICK THEM UP READILY WHAT WITH THAT AND A REALLY GOOD INTERPRETER WE TOOK WITH US I MADE OUT QUITE A FEW LEGENDS AND FOLK MYTHS OF THESE SCATTERED TRIBES
NOW FOR THE FOLKS I'VE HAD ENOUGH SCENERY SO WE SAILED LOW CROSSING BACK AND FORTH QUARTERING THE COUNTRY AS WE WENT AND STUDYING IT WE SAW I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW HOW MUCH OF THIS WE NOTED THEN AND HOW MUCH WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY OUR LATER KNOWLEDGE
PEACHES ADDED TERRY SCARCELY LOUDER PEACHERINOS APRICOT NECTARINES WHEW THEY WERE GIRLS OF COURSE NO BOYS COULD EVER HAVE SHOWN THAT SPARKLING BEAUTY AND YET
HE SUGGESTED BY SIGNS THAT WE ALL GO DOWN TOGETHER BUT AGAIN THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS STILL MERRILY THEN ELLADOR CLEARLY INDICATED THAT WE SHOULD GO DOWN POINTING TO EACH AND ALL OF US WITH UNMISTAKABLE FIRMNESS AND FURTHER
DELIGHTEDLY THEN TERRY WHOLLY IN HIS ELEMENT MADE A POLITE SPEECH WITH EXPLANATORY GESTURES AND PROCEEDED TO INTRODUCE US WITH POINTING FINGER MISTER JEFF MARGRAVE HE SAID CLEARLY
WE'LL LEAVE PAPERS WITH OUR CONSUL WHERE THE YACHT STAYS TERRY PLANNED
WHOLE BOOKS FULL OF NOTES CAREFULLY COPIED RECORDS FIRSTHAND DESCRIPTIONS AND THE PICTURES THAT'S THE WORST LOSS WE HAD SOME BIRD'S EYES OF THE CITIES AND PARKS
OR WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS THE MAIN STREAM
BUT TERRY STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS LOOK HERE FELLOWS HE SAID THIS IS OUR FIND LET'S NOT TELL THOSE COCKY OLD PROFESSORS LET'S GO ON HOME WITH EM AND THEN COME BACK JUST US HAVE A LITTLE EXPEDITION OF OUR OWN WE LOOKED AT HIM MUCH IMPRESSED
YES BUT HOW WILL THEY GET UP ASKED JEFF SAME WAY WE DO OF COURSE IF THREE VALUABLE AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE LOST UP THERE THEY WILL FOLLOW SOMEHOW TO SAY NOTHING OF THE GLITTERING ATTRACTIONS OF THAT FAIR LAND LET'S CALL IT FEMINISIA
BUT NOT QUITE TO HIS FULL STRETCH SHE WAS VISIBLY MOVED I NOTED HESITATED SPOKE TO HER COMPANIONS THEY CHATTERED SOFTLY TOGETHER
SHE LAID A FIRM DELICATE HAND ON HER GOLD GREEN JERKIN ELLADOR THIS WAS PLEASANT BUT WE GOT NO NEARER WE CAN'T SIT HERE AND LEARN THE LANGUAGE TERRY PROTESTED
SO WE GOT THE BIG BIPLANE TOGETHER AND LOADED IT WITH OUR SCIENTIFICALLY COMPRESSED BAGGAGE THE CAMERA OF COURSE THE GLASSES A SUPPLY OF CONCENTRATED FOOD OUR POCKETS WERE MAGAZINES OF SMALL NECESSITIES AND WE HAD OUR GUNS OF COURSE THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TERRY REMARKED DRILY GO YOU'LL HAVE TO GET AN INJUNCTION TO STOP ME BOTH JEFF AND I WERE SURE ABOUT THAT BUT
THERE WAS A DESPERATE TANGLE OF WOOD AND WATER AND A SWAMPY PATCH WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE FOUND OUR WAY ACROSS ALONE BUT THERE WAS ONE AND I COULD SEE TERRY WITH COMPASS AND NOTEBOOK MARKING DIRECTIONS AND TRYING TO PLACE LANDMARKS
BUT THEY NEVER CAME BACK IT WAS NO PLACE FOR MEN OF THAT THEY SEEMED SURE I TOLD THE BOYS ABOUT THESE STORIES AND THEY LAUGHED AT THEM NATURALLY I DID MYSELF I KNEW THE STUFF THAT SAVAGE DREAMS ARE MADE OF
AND THEN WE HELD OUR PEACE FOR A LONG RUN UPWARD GOSH SAID TERRY AFTER A WHILE ONLY WOMEN THERE AND CHILDREN JEFF URGED EXCITEDLY
OUR INSTRUMENTS MEASURED IT CLEARLY WE HAD NOT REALIZED THE LONG GENTLE RISE FROM THE COAST PERHAPS
A SORT OF WEDDING CALL THIS IS A CONDITION KNOWN TO HAVE EXISTED HERE'S JUST A SURVIVAL
WE MUSTN'T LOOK TO FIND ANY SORT OF ORDER AND ORGANIZATION YOU'RE DEAD WRONG JEFF TOLD HIM
WHAT HEADLINES NOT MUCH SAID TERRY GRIMLY THIS IS OUR PARTY WE'RE GOING TO FIND THAT PLACE ALONE
THESE TOWERING TREES WERE UNDER AS CAREFUL CULTIVATION AS SO MANY CABBAGES IN OTHER CONDITIONS
HE REFUSED TO LISTEN TO JEFF'S SUGGESTION THAT WE EXAMINE THE COUNTRY FURTHER BEFORE WE RISKED LEAVING OUR MACHINE
WE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY FOR OVER A YEAR HARDLY BELIEVING THAT THERE WAS SUCH A PLACE AND NOW WE WERE IN IT
THEY NEEDED A DOCTOR AND THAT GAVE JEFF AN EXCUSE FOR DROPPING HIS JUST OPENING PRACTICE THEY NEEDED TERRY'S EXPERIENCE HIS MACHINE AND HIS MONEY AND AS FOR ME I GOT IN THROUGH TERRY'S INFLUENCE
EACH ONE BALANCED ON A LONG BRANCH THAT DIPPED AND SWAYED BENEATH THE WEIGHT WE PAUSED UNCERTAIN IF WE PURSUED FURTHER THE BOUGHS WOULD BREAK UNDER THE DOUBLE BURDEN WE MIGHT SHAKE THEM OFF PERHAPS BUT NONE OF US WAS SO INCLINED
BUT WE COULD NOT HELP SEEING THIS MUCH EVEN ON THAT EXCITED DAY A LAND IN A STATE OF PERFECT CULTIVATION WHERE EVEN THE FORESTS LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE CARED FOR A LAND THAT LOOKED LIKE AN ENORMOUS PARK
TERRY GOT OUT HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS AND SQUATTED DOWN TO INVESTIGATE CHEMICALS OF SOME SORT I CAN'T TELL ON THE SPOT LOOK TO ME LIKE DYESTUFFS LET'S GET NEARER HE URGED UP THERE BY THE FALL
OH CLOTH WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SPINSTERS BUT THERE THEY STOP YOU'LL SEE WE JOKED TERRY ABOUT HIS MODEST IMPRESSION THAT HE WOULD BE WARMLY RECEIVED BUT HE HELD HIS GROUND YOU'LL SEE HE INSISTED
JEFF MARGRAVE WAS BORN TO BE A POET A BOTANIST OR BOTH BUT HIS FOLKS PERSUADED HIM TO BE A DOCTOR INSTEAD HE WAS A GOOD ONE FOR HIS AGE BUT HIS REAL INTEREST WAS IN WHAT HE LOVED TO CALL THE WONDERS OF SCIENCE
IN THE SOFT DAPPLED LIGHT OF THESE HIGH REGIONS BREATHLESS WITH OUR RAPID CLIMB WE RESTED AWHILE EAGERLY STUDYING OUR OBJECTS OF PURSUIT WHILE THEY IN TURN WITH NO MORE TERROR THAN A SET OF FROLICSOME CHILDREN IN A GAME OF TAG
WE HELD AND ASKED NO QUESTIONS BUT BARRING A POSSIBLE EXCEPTION IN FAVOR OF A NOT IMPOSSIBLE WIFE OR OF HIS MOTHER OR OF COURSE THE FAIR RELATIVES OF HIS FRIENDS TERRY'S IDEA SEEMED TO BE THAT
BUT WHEN WE HAD REACHED OUR FARTHEST POINT JUST THE DAY BEFORE WE ALL HAD TO TURN AROUND AND START FOR HOME AGAIN AS THE BEST OF EXPEDITIONS MUST IN TIME WE THREE MADE A DISCOVERY THE MAIN ENCAMPMENT WAS ON A SPIT OF LAND RUNNING OUT INTO THE MAIN STREAM
ALMOST LOSING HIS POSITION AS HIS HAND CLUTCHED ONLY AIR AND THEN WITH INCONCEIVABLE RAPIDITY THE THREE BRIGHT CREATURES WERE GONE THEY DROPPED FROM THE ENDS OF THE BIG BOUGHS TO THOSE BELOW FAIRLY POURING THEMSELVES OFF THE TREE
HE LIVED UP TO HIS IDEALS YOU MIGHT SAY TERRY DID TOO IF YOU CAN CALL HIS VIEWS ABOUT WOMEN ANYTHING SO POLITE AS IDEALS I ALWAYS LIKED TERRY HE WAS A MAN'S MAN VERY MUCH SO GENEROUS AND BRAVE AND CLEVER BUT
WITH CIRCLING SEATS BENEATH LOOK HE PURSUED THERE ARE SHORT STUMPS OF BRANCHES LEFT TO CLIMB ON THERE'S SOMEONE UP THAT TREE I BELIEVE WE STOLE NEAR CAUTIOUSLY
THERE WAS A VERY LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL TREE IN THE GLADE WE HAD JUST ENTERED WITH THICK WIDE SPREADING BRANCHES THAT SLOPED OUT IN LAPPING FANS LIKE A BEECH OR PINE IT WAS TRIMMED UNDERNEATH SOME TWENTY FEET UP AND STOOD THERE LIKE A HUGE UMBRELLA
WE HAD OUR GLASSES OUT EVEN TERRY
THE REST SPLENDID HARDWOOD CALL THIS A FOREST IT'S A TRUCK FARM GOOD THING TO HAVE A BOTANIST ON HAND I AGREED SURE THERE ARE NO MEDICINAL ONES OR ANY FOR PURE ORNAMENT AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY WERE QUITE RIGHT
WE COULD SEE WHERE IT POURED DOWN A NARROW VERTICAL CATARACT FROM AN OPENING IN THE FACE OF THE CLIFF IT WAS SWEET WATER THE GUIDE DRANK EAGERLY AND SO DID WE THAT'S SNOW WATER TERRY ANNOUNCED MUST COME FROM WAY BACK IN THE HILLS
IT WAS REALLY UNPLEASANT SOMETIMES TO SEE THE NOTIONS HE HAD BUT I GOT OUT OF PATIENCE WITH JEFF TOO HE HAD SUCH ROSE COLORED HALOS ON HIS WOMENFOLKS
ON THE OCEAN VOYAGE AND THE RIVER VOYAGE TOO ADMITTING THE IMPROBABILITY WE'D BEGIN SOLEMNLY AND THEN LAUNCH OUT AGAIN THEY WOULD FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES TERRY INSISTED WOMEN ALWAYS DO
I TOLD HIM TERRY BLAZED UP AT ONCE ASK HIM HOW FAR IT IS THE MAN INDICATED A SHORT JOURNEY I JUDGED ABOUT TWO HOURS MAYBE THREE
HERLAND BY CHARLOTTE PERKINS STETSON GILMAN
WHILE WE CLIMBED DOWNWARD AS SWIFTLY AS WE COULD WE HEARD THEIR VANISHING GAY LAUGHTER WE SAW THEM FLEETING AWAY IN THE WIDE OPEN REACHES OF THE FOREST AND GAVE CHASE BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CHASED WILD ANTELOPES SO WE STOPPED AT LENGTH SOMEWHAT BREATHLESS
TERRY WAS STUDYING THE FOREST GROWTH
THAT THESE FIVE CAME DOWN TO HIM BEFORE HE LEFT THE PLACE CONDEMNED TO DIE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE FIRST OF THEM TOLD HIM SO WITH THE CUSTOMARY PRISON SIGN OF DEATH A RAISED FINGER AND THEY ALL ADDED IN WORDS
NO OTHER MAN IN ALL THIS FRANCE COULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR ME SHE LAID HER HEAD UPON HER FATHER'S BREAST AS SHE HAD LAID HIS POOR HEAD ON HER OWN BREAST LONG LONG AGO HE WAS HAPPY IN THE RETURN HE HAD MADE HER
WITH THE SECOND PREDOMINATING NO SOONER WAS THE ACQUITTAL PRONOUNCED THAN TEARS WERE SHED AS FREELY AS BLOOD AT ANOTHER TIME AND SUCH FRATERNAL EMBRACES WERE BESTOWED UPON THE PRISONER BY AS MANY OF BOTH SEXES AS COULD RUSH AT HIM
AND TWO HAD ALREADY BEEN GUILLOTINED AND FORGOTTEN THE LIST WAS READ IN THE VAULTED CHAMBER WHERE DARNAY HAD SEEN THE ASSOCIATED PRISONERS ON THE NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL EVERY ONE OF THOSE HAD PERISHED IN THE MASSACRE
BECAUSE HE HAD VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISHED A TITLE THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND A STATION THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND HAD LEFT HIS COUNTRY HE SUBMITTED BEFORE THE WORD EMIGRANT IN THE PRESENT ACCEPTATION BY THE TRIBUNAL WAS IN USE
THE MESS ROOM WILL DRINK ISABELLA THORPE FOR A FORTNIGHT AND SHE WILL LAUGH WITH YOUR BROTHER OVER POOR TILNEY'S PASSION FOR A MONTH CATHERINE WOULD CONTEND NO LONGER AGAINST COMFORT
OH DEAR SAID GUB GUB THE KING'S MEN ARE QUITE CLOSE NOW LOOK AT THEM I AM AFRAID WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN BACK TO PRISON AGAIN AND HE BEGAN TO WEEP
OR WHICH THEY REGARDED AS SOME SET OFF AGAINST THEIR SWOLLEN ACCOUNT OF CRUEL RAGE NO MAN CAN DECIDE NOW TO WHICH OF THESE MOTIVES SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WERE REFERABLE IT IS PROBABLE TO A BLENDING OF ALL THE THREE
AND SHE THOUGHT WITH SINCERE COMPASSION OF HIS APPROACHING DISAPPOINTMENT FOR IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED HERSELF TO OVERHEAR IN THE PUMP ROOM HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SO INCOMPATIBLE WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF ISABELLA'S ENGAGEMENT
ISABELLA IS WRONG BUT I AM SURE SHE CANNOT MEAN TO TORMENT FOR SHE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET AND WHILE MY FATHER'S CONSENT WAS UNCERTAIN SHE FRETTED HERSELF ALMOST INTO A FEVER
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE MONKEYS HAD NO HISTORY BOOKS OF THEIR OWN BEFORE DOCTOR DOLITTLE CAME TO WRITE THEM FOR THEM THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS BY TELLING STORIES TO THEIR CHILDREN
THEY WERE STILL BEING FOLLOWED BY THE KING'S MEN IF CHEE CHEE HAD KNOWN THIS HE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE HIDDEN THEM AGAIN BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW IT ONE DAY CHEE CHEE CLIMBED UP A HIGH ROCK AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE TREE TOPS
CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEY EVEN GOT THE DOCTOR SOME TOBACCO ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND WANTED TO SMOKE
AND AFTER EMBRACING THE EVER ZEALOUS AND FAITHFUL PROSS WHO LIFTED HER HE TOOK HIS WIFE IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER UP TO THEIR ROOMS LUCIE MY OWN I AM SAFE O DEAREST CHARLES
YOU KNOW SHE MUST BE ATTACHED TO HIM I UNDERSTAND
UNTIL THE VERY TIDE OF THE RIVER ON THE BANK OF WHICH THE MAD SCENE WAS ACTED SEEMED TO RUN MAD LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHORE THEY PUT HIM INTO A GREAT CHAIR THEY HAD AMONG THEM
BY THIS TIME THE DOCTOR HAD PICKED HIMSELF UP AND ON THEY WENT AGAIN RUNNING AND RUNNING AND CHEE CHEE SHOUTED IT'S ALL RIGHT WE HAVEN'T FAR TO GO NOW
HE CALLED EVERYBODY A FOOL HE THREW HIS TOOTH BRUSH AT THE PALACE CAT HE RUSHED ROUND IN HIS NIGHT SHIRT AND WOKE UP ALL HIS ARMY AND SENT THEM INTO THE JUNGLE TO CATCH THE DOCTOR
SO THAT HIS TEARS AND HER LIPS MIGHT COME TOGETHER UNSEEN A FEW OF THE PEOPLE FELL TO DANCING
SO FAR FROM BEING IN FAVOUR WITH THE ARISTOCRAT GOVERNMENT THERE HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED FOR HIS LIFE BY IT AS THE FOE OF ENGLAND AND FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AS HE BROUGHT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO VIEW WITH THE GREATEST DISCRETION
COME OUT AND LISTEN TO THE EVENING PAPER YOU INSIDE THERE CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SO AT LAST BEGAN THE EVENING PAPER AT LA FORCE
IN WINDING AND TRAMPING THROUGH THEM AS THEY HAD REDDENED THEM BELOW THE SNOW WITH A DEEPER DYE THEY CARRIED HIM THUS INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE BUILDING WHERE HE LIVED HER FATHER HAD GONE ON BEFORE TO PREPARE HER
SHE WISHED BY A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE TO REMIND ISABELLA OF HER SITUATION AND MAKE HER AWARE OF THIS DOUBLE UNKINDNESS BUT FOR REMONSTRANCE EITHER OPPORTUNITY OR COMPREHENSION WAS ALWAYS AGAINST HER
MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT WAS HENRY'S ANSWER DOES HE THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT SHE EAGERLY CONTINUED
BUT IT WAS A DEGREE OF WILFUL THOUGHTLESSNESS WHICH CATHERINE COULD NOT BUT RESENT JAMES WAS THE SUFFERER SHE SAW HIM GRAVE AND UNEASY AND HOWEVER CARELESS OF HIS PRESENT COMFORT
AFTER SOME MOMENTS CONSIDERATION YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GUESS AT YOUR BROTHER'S INTENTIONS FROM ALL THIS BUT I AM SURE I CANNOT BUT IS NOT YOUR FATHER UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT
YES I THINK SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART MY BROTHER'S HEART AS YOU TERM IT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ASSURE YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT WELL
BUT WHAT HE MOST NOTICED IN THE TWO FIGURES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE POSTED AS CLOSE TO HIMSELF AS THEY COULD BE THEY NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION
AND A LITTLE CONCERT FOR THAT EVENING THEY CROWDED TO THE GRATES AND SHED TEARS THERE BUT TWENTY PLACES IN THE PROJECTED ENTERTAINMENTS HAD TO BE REFILLED AND THE TIME WAS AT BEST SHORT TO THE LOCK UP HOUR
ON THESE FEW STEPS OF HIS DANGEROUS WAY CHARLES DARNAY HAD SET HIS FOOT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR MANETTE'S REITERATED INSTRUCTIONS THE SAME CAUTIOUS COUNSEL DIRECTED EVERY STEP THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
WELL NAY IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES TO BE GUIDED BY SECOND HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE YOU
WAS PACKED OFF TO HELP THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR SEARCH ALL THIS TIME THE DOCTOR AND HIS ANIMALS WERE RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO GUB GUB
IT MIGHT HAVE PASSED UNNOTICED A SOMETHING OF LANGUID INDIFFERENCE OR OF THAT BOASTED ABSENCE OF MIND WHICH CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE WOULD OCCASIONALLY COME ACROSS HER BUT HAD NOTHING WORSE APPEARED
WHEREAS IN ENGLAND HE LIVED BY GIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE HE HAD RETURNED WHEN HE DID ON THE PRESSING AND WRITTEN ENTREATY OF A FRENCH CITIZEN WHO REPRESENTED THAT HIS LIFE WAS ENDANGERED BY HIS ABSENCE
I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER NO HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT CRIED CATHERINE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER
SOME DAGGERS SOME ATE AND DRANK AS THEY LOOKED ON MANY KNITTED AMONG THESE LAST WAS ONE WITH A SPARE PIECE OF KNITTING UNDER HER ARM AS SHE WORKED SHE WAS IN A FRONT ROW BY THE SIDE OF A MAN
BUT WHICH HE DID NOT DOUBT WOULD BE FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS THEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT THE DOCTOR HAD TAKEN CARE THAT IT SHOULD BE THERE HAD ASSURED HIM THAT IT WOULD BE THERE
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS THEY CAME TO A STEEP CLIFF WITH A RIVER FLOWING BELOW THIS WAS THE END OF THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI
THE LONGER HE STAYS THE WORSE IT WILL BE FOR HIM AT LAST PRAY ADVISE HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE AND FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE TO LEAVE BATH DIRECTLY ABSENCE WILL IN TIME MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE AGAIN BUT HE CAN HAVE NO HOPE HERE
AND SO DID ALL OF THEM JOHN DOLITTLE WAS THE LAST TO CROSS AND JUST AS HE WAS GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUSHING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHOOK THEIR FISTS AND YELLED WITH RAGE
SURE IF YOUR FATHER WERE TO SPEAK TO HIM HE WOULD GO MY DEAR MISS MORLAND SAID HENRY IN THIS AMIABLE SOLICITUDE FOR YOUR BROTHER'S COMFORT MAY YOU NOT BE A LITTLE MISTAKEN
HENRY SMILED AND SAID I AM SURE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT WISH TO DO THAT THEN YOU WILL PERSUADE HIM TO GO AWAY PERSUASION IS NOT AT COMMAND BUT PARDON ME
AND HE LED THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS TO THE VERY THICKEST PART OF THE FOREST A PLACE WHERE NO MAN HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE AND HID THEM ALL IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE BETWEEN HIGH ROCKS
AND ENJOYED THE LIFE OF TRAVEL VERY MUCH BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS GLAD WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AND THEY STOPPED FOR THEIR RESTING TIME THEN THE DOCTOR USED TO MAKE A LITTLE FIRE OF STICKS
HAD BEEN A WITNESS ON THAT ENGLISH TRIAL AND COULD CORROBORATE HIS ACCOUNT OF IT THE JURY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HEARD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY WERE READY WITH THEIR VOTES IF THE PRESIDENT WERE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THEM AT EVERY VOTE
AND THEY LOOKED AT THE JURY BUT AT NOTHING ELSE UNDER THE PRESIDENT SAT DOCTOR MANETTE IN HIS USUAL QUIET DRESS AS WELL AS THE PRISONER COULD SEE HE AND MISTER LORRY WERE THE ONLY MEN THERE UNCONNECTED WITH THE TRIBUNAL
BUT AS HE PROCEEDED AS HE SHOWED THAT THE ACCUSED WAS HIS FIRST FRIEND ON HIS RELEASE FROM HIS LONG IMPRISONMENT THAT THE ACCUSED HAD REMAINED IN ENGLAND ALWAYS FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND HIMSELF IN THEIR EXILE THAT
HAD HEARD THE NOISE OF THE MONKEYS CHEERING AND THEY AT LAST KNEW WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS AND HASTENED ON TO CATCH HIM THE BIG MONKEY CARRYING GUB GUB WAS COMING ALONG BEHIND SLOWLY
WHOSE LIFE WAS FORFEIT TO THE REPUBLIC UNDER THE DECREE WHICH BANISHED ALL EMIGRANTS ON PAIN OF DEATH IT WAS NOTHING THAT THE DECREE BORE DATE SINCE HIS RETURN TO FRANCE THERE HE WAS AND THERE WAS THE DECREE
EVERY HUMAN CREATURE HE HAD SINCE CARED FOR AND PARTED WITH HAD DIED ON THE SCAFFOLD THERE WERE HURRIED WORDS OF FAREWELL AND KINDNESS BUT THE PARTING WAS SOON OVER IT WAS THE INCIDENT OF EVERY DAY
LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THE FIVE HAD HAD IT IS TRUE NO AUDIENCE TO LENGTHEN THEIR PROCEEDINGS FOR WHEN HE AND DOCTOR MANETTE EMERGED FROM THE GATE THERE WAS A GREAT CROWD ABOUT IT
IF HE KNOWS HER ENGAGEMENT WHAT CAN HE MEAN BY HIS BEHAVIOUR YOU ARE A VERY CLOSE QUESTIONER AM I I ONLY ASK WHAT I WANT TO BE TOLD
WHEN THE COMMON ROOMS AND CORRIDORS WOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE GREAT DOGS WHO KEPT WATCH THERE THROUGH THE NIGHT THE PRISONERS WERE FAR FROM INSENSIBLE OR UNFEELING THEIR WAYS AROSE OUT OF THE CONDITION OF THE TIME SIMILARLY
PERCEIVING HER STILL TO LOOK DOUBTFUL AND GRAVE HE ADDED THOUGH FREDERICK DOES NOT LEAVE BATH WITH US HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BUT A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEHIND US
WAS A BRIDGE ALL READY FOR HIM MADE OF LIVING MONKEYS FOR WHILE HIS BACK WAS TURNED THE MONKEYS QUICK AS A FLASH HAD MADE THEMSELVES INTO A BRIDGE
NO AND THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO QUIET THEM WHICH IT DID NOT FOR THEY CONTINUED TO CRY NO
AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD FORCE OF TRUTH AND EARNESTNESS THE JURY AND THE POPULACE BECAME ONE AT LAST WHEN HE APPEALED BY NAME TO MONSIEUR LORRY AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN THEN AND THERE PRESENT WHO LIKE HIMSELF
THEY'VE GOT THE CAPTAIN LOOSE AND HE'S COMING ON LIKE A DEER GET LIVELY
IN WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE EVERY FACE HE HAD SEEN IN COURT EXCEPT TWO FOR WHICH HE LOOKED IN VAIN ON HIS COMING OUT THE CONCOURSE MADE AT HIM ANEW WEEPING EMBRACING AND SHOUTING ALL BY TURNS AND ALL TOGETHER
AND ALL OF US HAVE LIKE WONDERS HIDDEN IN OUR BREASTS ONLY NEEDING CIRCUMSTANCES TO EVOKE THEM THE PASSAGE TO THE CONCIERGERIE WAS SHORT AND DARK
AND THE BIG ONE SHOUTED TO THE DOCTOR WALK OVER WALK OVER ALL OF YOU HURRY GUB GUB WAS A BIT SCARED WALKING ON SUCH A NARROW BRIDGE AT THAT DIZZY HEIGHT
THEN BEGAN ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WITH WHICH THE POPULACE SOMETIMES GRATIFIED THEIR FICKLENESS OR THEIR BETTER IMPULSES TOWARDS GENEROSITY AND MERCY
UNDOUBTEDLY IT WAS WAS HE NOT AN EMIGRANT THEN WHAT DID HE CALL HIMSELF NOT AN EMIGRANT HE HOPED WITHIN THE SENSE AND SPIRIT OF THE LAW WHY NOT THE PRESIDENT DESIRED TO KNOW
AND HAD PREPARED EVERY INCH OF HIS ROAD THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHY HAD HE RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN HE DID AND NOT SOONER HE HAD NOT RETURNED SOONER HE REPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS OF LIVING IN FRANCE SAVE THOSE HE HAD RESIGNED
THE BRIDGE OF APES QUEEN ERMINTRUDE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE SEEN HER HUSBAND SO TERRIBLE AS HE GOT THAT NIGHT HE GNASHED HIS TEETH WITH RAGE
THE PRESIDENT REMINDED HIM TRUE BUT NOT AN ENGLISH WOMAN A CITIZENESS OF FRANCE YES BY BIRTH HER NAME AND FAMILY
BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD VERY LONG EARS THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS VERY SHORT AND AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HOLD OF THE DOCTOR ONE OF HIS EARS CAUGHT FAST IN A TREE
IF ABLE TO SUGGEST A HINT ISABELLA COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT IN THIS DISTRESS THE INTENDED DEPARTURE OF THE TILNEY FAMILY BECAME HER CHIEF CONSOLATION THEIR JOURNEY INTO GLOUCESTERSHIRE WAS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW DAYS
I THINK MISTER MORLAND WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE A DIFFERENCE NO MAN IS OFFENDED BY ANOTHER MAN'S ADMIRATION OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES IT IS THE WOMAN ONLY WHO CAN MAKE IT A TORMENT CATHERINE BLUSHED FOR HER FRIEND AND SAID
NOT THAT JAMES HAS EVER TOLD ME SO BUT I AM SURE HE IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ARE YOU SURE IT IS MY BROTHER'S DOING YES VERY SURE IS IT MY BROTHER'S ATTENTIONS TO MISS THORPE
MANY GREAT EXPLORERS AND GRAY BEARDED NATURALISTS HAVE LAIN LONG WEEKS HIDDEN IN THE JUNGLE WAITING TO SEE THE MONKEYS DO THAT TRICK BUT WE NEVER LET A WHITE MAN GET A GLIMPSE OF IT BEFORE YOU ARE THE FIRST TO SEE THE FAMOUS BRIDGE OF APES
HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH
TO LIVE BY HIS OWN INDUSTRY IN ENGLAND RATHER THAN ON THE INDUSTRY OF THE OVERLADEN PEOPLE OF FRANCE WHAT PROOF HAD HE OF THIS HE HANDED IN THE NAMES OF TWO WITNESSES THEOPHILE GABELLE AND ALEXANDRE MANETTE
AND HE TOLD THEM OF THE GREAT MAMMOTHS AND LIZARDS AS LONG AS A TRAIN THAT WANDERED OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THOSE TIMES NIBBLING FROM THE TREE TOPS AND OFTEN THEY GOT SO INTERESTED LISTENING
HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN FRANCE AND HIS HEAD WAS DEMANDED TAKE OFF HIS HEAD CRIED THE AUDIENCE AN ENEMY TO THE REPUBLIC THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO SILENCE THOSE CRIES
WHO WORE THEIR USUAL CLOTHES AND HAD NOT ASSUMED THE COARSE GARB
HE HAD COME BACK TO SAVE A CITIZEN'S LIFE AND TO BEAR HIS TESTIMONY AT WHATEVER PERSONAL HAZARD TO THE TRUTH WAS THAT CRIMINAL IN THE EYES OF THE REPUBLIC THE POPULACE CRIED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
AFTER A SHORT PAUSE CATHERINE RESUMED WITH THEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA SO VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER I CAN HAVE NO OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT BUT WHAT CAN YOUR BROTHER MEAN
THAT IN THE PRESSURE OF BUSINESS IMPOSED ON THE TRIBUNAL BY THE MULTITUDE OF ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WHICH IT HAD TO DEAL HE HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY OVERLOOKED IN HIS PRISON OF THE ABBAYE IN FACT
ARE YOU NOT CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR WOULD HE THANK YOU EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR MISS THORPE'S FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION OR AT LEAST HER GOOD BEHAVIOUR IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN TILNEY
THE JURYMEN VOTED ALOUD AND INDIVIDUALLY THE POPULACE SET UP A SHOUT OF APPLAUSE ALL THE VOICES WERE IN THE PRISONER'S FAVOUR AND THE PRESIDENT DECLARED HIM FREE
THE PRESIDENT REQUIRED THE NAME OF THAT CITIZEN THE ACCUSED EXPLAINED THAT THE CITIZEN WAS HIS FIRST WITNESS HE ALSO REFERRED WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE CITIZEN'S LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM AT THE BARRIER
OF THE DAYS WHEN MEN DRESSED IN BEAR SKINS AND LIVED IN HOLES IN THE ROCK AND ATE THEIR MUTTON RAW BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT COOKING WAS HAVING NEVER SEEN A FIRE
THAT AFTER HIS LONG AND UNWHOLESOME CONFINEMENT HE WAS IN DANGER OF FAINTING FROM EXHAUSTION NONE THE LESS BECAUSE HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE VERY SAME PEOPLE CARRIED BY ANOTHER CURRENT WOULD HAVE RUSHED AT HIM WITH THE VERY SAME INTENSITY
THEY WOULD SIT ROUND IT IN A RING LISTENING TO POLYNESIA SINGING SONGS ABOUT THE SEA OR TO CHEE CHEE TELLING STORIES OF THE JUNGLE AND MANY OF THE TALES THAT CHEE CHEE TOLD WERE VERY INTERESTING
COMING AFTER THEM BEGAN TO RUN TOO AND THE CAPTAIN RAN HARDEST OF ALL THEN THE DOCTOR TRIPPED OVER HIS MEDICINE BAG AND FELL DOWN IN THE MUD AND THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT HE WOULD SURELY CATCH HIM THIS TIME
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR HIS ARMY TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS IN A STRANGE LAND AND WOULD NOT KNOW HIS WAY BUT HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE KNEW ALL THE PATHS THROUGH THE JUNGLE BETTER EVEN THAN THE KING'S MEN DID
HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE WILL SOON EXPIRE AND HE MUST RETURN TO HIS REGIMENT AND WHAT WILL THEN BE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
AND HE SAW THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARMY SNEAKING THROUGH THE TREES SO HE HURRIED AFTER THE DOCTOR AND TOLD HIM TO RUN THEN THEY ALL RAN HARDER THAN THEY HAD EVER RUN IN THEIR LIVES AND THE KING'S MEN
BY THE SURRENDER OF THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE WAS NEXT QUESTIONED HIS HIGH PERSONAL POPULARITY AND THE CLEARNESS OF HIS ANSWERS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION
AND THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE ACROSS THE RIVER AND JIP THE DOG LOOKED DOWN OVER THE EDGE OF THE STEEP STEEP CLIFF AND SAID GOLLY HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET ACROSS
AT LAST WHEN DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO COME THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES OVERHEAD THEY HEARD QUEEN ERMINTRUDE SAYING IN A VERY TIRED VOICE THAT IT WAS NO USE LOOKING ANY MORE THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND GET SOME SLEEP
BUT A WILD INFECTION OF THE WILDLY SHAKEN PUBLIC MIND IN SEASONS OF PESTILENCE SOME OF US WILL HAVE A SECRET ATTRACTION TO THE DISEASE A TERRIBLE PASSING INCLINATION TO DIE OF IT
LUCIE MANETTE ONLY DAUGHTER OF DOCTOR MANETTE THE GOOD PHYSICIAN WHO SITS THERE THIS ANSWER HAD A HAPPY EFFECT UPON THE AUDIENCE CRIES IN EXALTATION OF THE WELL KNOWN GOOD PHYSICIAN RENT THE HALL
THE NIGHT IN ITS VERMIN HAUNTED CELLS WAS LONG AND COLD NEXT DAY FIFTEEN PRISONERS WERE PUT TO THE BAR BEFORE CHARLES DARNAY'S NAME WAS CALLED ALL THE FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED
SO THERE THEY STAYED THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH THEY OFTEN HEARD THE KING'S MEN SEARCHING AND TALKING IN THE JUNGLE ROUND ABOUT BUT THEY WERE QUITE SAFE FOR NO ONE KNEW OF THAT HIDING PLACE BUT CHEE CHEE NOT EVEN THE OTHER MONKEYS
OR MISS THORPE'S ADMISSION OF THEM THAT GIVES THE PAIN
IS HE SAFE ONLY IN SOLITUDE OR IS HER HEART CONSTANT TO HIM ONLY WHEN UNSOLICITED BY ANYONE ELSE HE CANNOT THINK THIS AND YOU MAY BE SURE
THAT MIGHT ONLY HAVE SPREAD A NEW GRACE AND INSPIRED A WARMER INTEREST BUT WHEN CATHERINE SAW HER IN PUBLIC ADMITTING CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ATTENTIONS AS READILY AS THEY WERE OFFERED
AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
WITH HIS SHORT LEGS SOON GOT TIRED AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO CARRY HIM WHICH MADE IT PRETTY HARD WHEN THEY HAD THE TRUNK AND THE HAND BAG WITH THEM AS WELL THE KING OF THE JOLLIGINKI
AFTER GRASPING THE DOCTOR'S HAND AS HE STOOD VICTORIOUS AND PROUD BEFORE HIM AFTER GRASPING THE HAND OF MISTER LORRY
AND THEY SET OFF FOR THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS IT WAS A LONG LONG WAY AND THEY OFTEN GOT VERY TIRED ESPECIALLY GUB GUB BUT WHEN HE CRIED THEY GAVE HIM MILK OUT OF THE COCOANUTS
FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
A FEW DAYS PASSED AWAY AND CATHERINE THOUGH NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO SUSPECT HER FRIEND COULD NOT HELP WATCHING HER CLOSELY THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATIONS WAS NOT AGREEABLE
THESE MONKEYS MADE A TREMENDOUS NOISE CHEERING AND WAVING LEAVES AND SWINGING OUT OF THE BRANCHES TO GREET HIM THEY WANTED TO CARRY HIS BAG AND HIS TRUNK AND EVERYTHING HE HAD AND ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES EVEN CARRIED GUB GUB
AND CAPTAIN TILNEY'S REMOVAL WOULD AT LEAST RESTORE PEACE TO EVERY HEART BUT HIS OWN BUT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAD AT PRESENT NO INTENTION OF REMOVING HE WAS NOT TO BE OF THE PARTY TO NORTHANGER HE WAS TO CONTINUE AT BATH
THE SEVENTH CHAPTER
LET ME THANK GOD FOR THIS ON MY KNEES AS I HAVE PRAYED TO HIM THEY ALL REVERENTLY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND HEARTS WHEN SHE WAS AGAIN IN HIS ARMS HE SAID TO HER
CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY HAD REASON TO KNOW THE USAGE HE HAD SEEN HUNDREDS PASS AWAY SO
TO REND HIM TO PIECES AND STREW HIM OVER THE STREETS HIS REMOVAL TO MAKE WAY FOR OTHER ACCUSED PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE TRIED RESCUED HIM FROM THESE CARESSES FOR THE MOMENT
THEN HE MADE ALL HIS SERVANTS GO TOO HIS COOKS AND HIS GARDENERS AND HIS BARBER AND PRINCE BUMPO'S TUTOR EVEN THE QUEEN WHO WAS TIRED FROM DANCING IN A PAIR OF TIGHT SHOES
WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
SOME LIGHT TROOPS AND CAVALRY FROM SELINUS A FEW GELOANS AND SICELS NUMBERING A THOUSAND IN ALL AND SET OUT ON HIS MARCH FOR SYRACUSE
TO PUT OUT AGAINST THEM FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT HARBOUR BESIDES THIS HE NOW BEGAN TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE WAR BY SEA SEEING THAT THE COMING OF GYLIPPUS HAD DIMINISHED THEIR HOPES BY LAND
WHILE THE ELEVEN OTHERS SAILED TO ITALY HEARING THAT VESSELS LADEN
AND ALLIES SAILING OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
GOING TO SICILY AND UNDERTAKING A NEW WAR NOTHING INFERIOR TO THAT WHICH THEY ALREADY HAD WITH THE PELOPONNESIANS THESE CAUSES
UNTIL THE ATHENIANS AT LAST RESOLVED NOT TO LET THEMSELVES BE WORN OUT BY WAITING WHERE THEY WERE BUT TO ATTACK WITHOUT DELAY AND GIVING A CHEER WENT INTO ACTION THE SYRACUSANS RECEIVED THEM AND CHARGING PROW TO PROW AS THEY HAD INTENDED
AND MEANWHILE PREPARED FOR THE MUSTER OF THEIR FORCES
TOO EXPENSIVE AS THE PAY OF EACH MAN WAS A DRACHMA A DAY
KING OF THE LACEDAEMONIANS THEY BEGAN BY DEVASTATING THE PARTS BORDERING UPON THE PLAIN AND NEXT PROCEEDED
FROM THEIR BEING MORE USED TO SAIL ROUND AND CHARGE THE ENEMY'S SIDE THAN TO MEET HIM PROW TO PROW
AND PASSED THE NIGHT THERE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE LED OUT THE MAIN BODY OF HIS ARMY AND DRAWING THEM UP IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE WALLS OF THE ATHENIANS TO PREVENT THEIR GOING TO THE RELIEF OF ANY OTHER QUARTER DISPATCHED A STRONG FORCE AGAINST FORT LABDALUM AND TOOK IT
OR FREEDMEN SIX HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY IN ALL UNDER THE COMMAND OF ECCRITUS
MEANWHILE THE SYRACUSANS PLIED THEM WITH MISSILES FROM THE DOCKS
WHO HAD FURNISHED THEM WITH THE DARTERS ARRIVED AT METAPONTIUM IN ITALY HERE THEY PERSUADED THEIR ALLIES THE METAPONTINES TO SEND WITH THEM THREE HUNDRED DARTERS AND TWO GALLEYS AND WITH THIS REINFORCEMENT COASTED ON TO THURII
WHICH NO ONE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE IF HE HAD HEARD OF IT BEFORE IT HAD COME TO PASS FOR COULD ANY ONE HAVE IMAGINED THAT EVEN WHEN BESIEGED BY THE PELOPONNESIANS ENTRENCHED IN ATTICA THEY WOULD STILL INSTEAD OF WITHDRAWING FROM SICILY
A CORINTHIAN HELD THE INTERVENING SPACE AND BLOCKED UP THE ENTRANCE THE ATHENIANS UNDER DIPHILUS NOW SAILED OUT AGAINST THEM WITH THIRTY THREE SHIPS FROM NAUPACTUS AND THE CORINTHIANS
OR OTHER OF THE VARIOUS FACILITIES OF ESCAPE WHICH THE MAGNITUDE OF SICILY AFFORDS THEM SOME EVEN ENGAGE IN TRADE THEMSELVES AND PREVAIL UPON THE CAPTAINS TO TAKE HYCCARIC SLAVES ON BOARD IN THEIR PLACE
AND THEY SENT AND APPOINTED A PLACE FOR THE SELINUNTINES TO MEET THEM WITH ALL THEIR FORCES A FEW TROOPS WERE ALSO PROMISED BY THE GELOANS AND SOME OF THE SICELS
WERE HAVING THE BEST OF IT IN THE ENGAGEMENT IN THE GREAT HARBOUR AND SENT A FAST SAILING GALLEY TO PURSUE THEM
WAS IN THE FIELD AND DILIGENTLY PROSECUTING THE WAR GREAT MISCHIEF WAS THEREFORE DONE TO THE ATHENIANS THEY WERE DEPRIVED OF THEIR WHOLE COUNTRY MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND SLAVES HAD DESERTED A GREAT PART OF THEM ARTISANS AND ALL THEIR SHEEP AND BEASTS OF BURDEN WERE LOST
AND THAT ONLY FOR A LITTLE WAY AND IN THE LITTLE SPACE IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN CAMP
ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THEM ABOUT LOCRIS AND RHEGIUM AND THE APPROACH TO SICILY GYLIPPUS MEANWHILE WENT ON WITH THE WALL ACROSS EPIPOLAE USING THE STONES WHICH THE ATHENIANS HAD LAID DOWN
TAKE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF DEPARTING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CITIES
SHOULD PUT AN END TO THE WAR THIS HE PREVENTED AND REASSURED THEM BY TELLING THEM THAT MORE VESSELS WERE STILL TO ARRIVE AND THAT GYLIPPUS SON OF CLEANDRIDAS HAD BEEN DISPATCHED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS TO TAKE THE COMMAND
FOR I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CONTEMPLATE A COMBINED ATTACK UPON OUR LINES WITH THEIR LAND FORCES AND WITH THEIR FLEET BY SEA YOU MUST NONE OF YOU BE SURPRISED THAT I SAY BY SEA ALSO
AFTER THIS THE REMAINING TWELVE VESSELS OF THE CORINTHIANS AMBRACIOTS AND LEUCADIANS SAILED INTO THE HARBOUR UNDER THE COMMAND
A LITTLE THE FIRST AND BROUGHT THEM UP TO THE WALL OF THE ATHENIANS
TO SEND TO THE OFFICIALS IN THE CITY AND TELL THEM TO MOVE THE SALE MARKET AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD DOWN TO THE SEA
OR STRONGLY REINFORCED FROM HOME THEY HAD NO HOPE OF SAFETY HE FEARED HOWEVER THAT THE MESSENGERS EITHER THROUGH INABILITY TO SPEAK OR THROUGH FAILURE OF MEMORY OR FROM A WISH TO PLEASE THE MULTITUDE MIGHT NOT REPORT THE TRUTH
WHILE WITH RESPECT TO MORAL ADVANTAGES IT WERE INTOLERABLE
THIS SAME SUMMER ARRIVED AT ATHENS THIRTEEN HUNDRED TARGETEERS THRACIAN SWORDSMEN OF THE TRIBE OF THE DII WHO WERE TO HAVE SAILED TO SICILY WITH DEMOSTHENES SINCE THEY HAD COME TOO LATE THE ATHENIANS DETERMINED TO SEND THEM BACK TO THRACE WHENCE THEY HAD COME
MADE ALL HASTE TO ARRIVE AND ONE OF THEIR COMMANDERS GONGYLUS STARTING LAST WITH A SINGLE SHIP WAS THE FIRST TO REACH SYRACUSE A LITTLE BEFORE GYLIPPUS GONGYLUS FOUND THE SYRACUSANS ON THE POINT OF HOLDING AN ASSEMBLY TO CONSIDER WHETHER THEY
GYLIPPUS LED OUT HIS HEAVY INFANTRY FURTHER FROM THE FORTIFICATIONS THAN ON THE FORMER OCCASION AND SO JOINED BATTLE POSTING HIS HORSE AND DARTERS UPON THE FLANK OF THE ATHENIANS IN THE OPEN SPACE WHERE THE WORKS OF THE TWO WALLS TERMINATED DURING THE ENGAGEMENT
THE ATHENIANS WERE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THEM WITH TWENTY SHIPS AT MEGARA BUT WERE ONLY ABLE TO TAKE ONE VESSEL WITH ITS CREW THE REST GETTING CLEAR OFF TO SYRACUSE
WHO NOT ONLY ROUTED THE SQUADRON IN QUESTION BUT ALSO THAT BY WHICH THEY WERE AT FIRST BEING DEFEATED IN THE HARBOUR SINKING ELEVEN OF THE SYRACUSAN VESSELS AND KILLING MOST OF THE MEN EXCEPT THE CREWS OF THREE SHIPS WHOM THEY MADE PRISONERS
TO THE SWORD THE PLACE NOT BEING WITHIN SIGHT OF THE ATHENIANS
STAY ON THERE BESIEGING IN LIKE MANNER SYRACUSE A TOWN TAKEN AS A TOWN IN NO WAY INFERIOR TO ATHENS OR WOULD SO THOROUGHLY UPSET THE HELLENIC ESTIMATE OF THEIR STRENGTH AND AUDACITY AS TO GIVE THE SPECTACLE OF A PEOPLE WHICH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR
BOEOTARCHS THE MYCALESSIANS LOST A LARGE PROPORTION OF THEIR POPULATION WHILE MYCALESSUS THUS EXPERIENCED A CALAMITY FOR ITS EXTENT AS LAMENTABLE AS ANY THAT HAPPENED IN THE WAR
HIS ARRIVAL CHANCED AT A CRITICAL MOMENT THE ATHENIANS HAD ALREADY FINISHED A DOUBLE WALL OF SIX OR SEVEN FURLONGS TO THE GREAT HARBOUR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL PORTION
BY WHICH HE HOPED TO ACHIEVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THE WAR NOT UNWORTHY OF THE RISK WITH HIM HERMOCRATES ACTIVELY JOINED IN TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HIS COUNTRYMEN TO ATTACK THE ATHENIANS AT SEA
LED THEM AGAINST MYCALESSUS THE NIGHT HE PASSED UNOBSERVED NEAR THE TEMPLE OF HERMES NOT QUITE TWO MILES FROM MYCALESSUS AND AT DAYBREAK ASSAULTED AND TOOK THE TOWN WHICH IS NOT A LARGE ONE THE INHABITANTS BEING OFF THEIR GUARD AND NOT EXPECTING THAT ANY ONE WOULD EVER COME UP
AND TO GUARD THE COUNTRY THEIR HORSES WERE EITHER LAMED BY BEING CONSTANTLY WORKED UPON ROCKY GROUND OR WOUNDED BY THE ENEMY
AS THE ENEMY WILL OBTAIN HIS SICILIAN REINFORCEMENTS SHORTLY THOSE FROM PELOPONNESE AFTER A LONGER INTERVAL AND UNLESS YOU ATTEND TO THE MATTER THE FORMER WILL BE HERE BEFORE YOU WHILE THE LATTER WILL ELUDE YOU AS THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE SUCH WERE THE
DEMOSTHENES AND EURYMEDON ACCORDINGLY SENT TEN OF THEIR BEST SAILERS WITH CONON
PRODUCED THEIR FINANCIAL EMBARRASSMENT AND IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THEY IMPOSED UPON THEIR SUBJECTS INSTEAD OF THE TRIBUTE THE TAX OF A TWENTIETH UPON ALL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS BY SEA WHICH THEY THOUGHT WOULD BRING THEM IN MORE MONEY THEIR EXPENDITURE BEING NOW
BUT ARE COMPELLED TO DEPEND BOTH FOR SUPPLYING THE CREWS IN SERVICE
WHEN THE FLEET WAS READY GYLIPPUS LED OUT THE WHOLE ARMY BY NIGHT HIS PLAN BEING TO ASSAULT IN PERSON THE FORTS ON PLEMMYRIUM BY LAND WHILE THIRTY FIVE SYRACUSAN GALLEYS SAILED ACCORDING TO APPOINTMENT AGAINST THE ENEMY FROM THE GREAT HARBOUR
AND NOTHING COULD BE BROUGHT IN WITHOUT FIGHTING BESIDES THE GENERAL IMPRESSION OF DISMAY AND DISCOURAGEMENT PRODUCED UPON THE ARMY AFTER THIS THE SYRACUSANS SENT OUT TWELVE SHIPS UNDER THE COMMAND OF AGATHARCHUS A SYRACUSAN
TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE AND THEY CONSULTED ACCORDINGLY WHETHER THEY SHOULD KEEP SICILY ON THEIR RIGHT AND RISK SAILING IN BY SEA
WITH MORE EASE THE SYRACUSAN SHIPS FIGHTING OFF THE MOUTH OF THE HARBOUR FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE ATHENIAN VESSELS AND SAILING IN WITHOUT ANY ORDER FELL FOUL OF ONE ANOTHER AND TRANSFERRED THE VICTORY TO THE ATHENIANS
UPON THEIR INEXPERIENCE HE ACCORDINGLY URGED THEM TO THROW ASIDE THEIR FEARS AND TO TRY THEIR FORTUNE AT SEA AND THE SYRACUSANS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GYLIPPUS AND HERMOCRATES AND PERHAPS SOME OTHERS MADE UP THEIR MINDS FOR THE SEA FIGHT AND BEGAN TO MAN THEIR VESSELS
SAYING THAT THE LATTER HAD NOT INHERITED THEIR NAVAL PROWESS NOR WOULD THEY RETAIN IT FOR EVER
PROMONTORY AND STARTING FROM THENCE
WENT TO LOCRI AND ONE OF THE MERCHANTMEN FROM PELOPONNESE COMING IN WHILE THEY WERE AT ANCHOR THERE CARRYING THESPIAN HEAVY INFANTRY TOOK THESE ON BOARD AND SAILED ALONGSHORE TOWARDS HOME
GUARD AT THIS POINT THEMSELVES DISPOSING THEIR CONFEDERATES ALONG THE REMAINDER OF THE WORKS
SYRACUSAN CAVALRY THE LOSS OF OUR PREVIOUS SUPERIORITY EMBOLDENS OUR SLAVES TO DESERT OUR FOREIGN SEAMEN ARE IMPRESSED BY THE UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE OF A NAVY AGAINST US
THE CAVALRY EXCEPTED AT THE DIFFERENT MILITARY POSTS OR UPON THE WALL BUT WHAT
WHEN THE ATHENIANS HAD HEARD IT THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT HIS RESIGNATION BUT CHOSE HIM TWO COLLEAGUES
SEEING THE LARGEST SO EASILY TAKEN AT THE FALL OF THE FIRST FORT THE MEN FROM IT WHO SUCCEEDED IN TAKING REFUGE IN THEIR BOATS AND MERCHANTMEN FOUND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN REACHING THE CAMP AS THE SYRACUSANS
WHERE THEY TOOK ON BOARD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
NOW NICIAS AND THE ATHENIANS HELD THE OPINION THAT EVEN IF THE SYRACUSANS SHOULD NOT WISH TO OFFER BATTLE IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO PREVENT THE BUILDING OF THE CROSS WALL AS IT ALREADY
THEIR OWN LOSS WAS CONFINED TO THREE VESSELS AND AFTER HAULING ASHORE THE SYRACUSAN WRECKS AND SETTING UP A TROPHY UPON THE
INDEED ALMOST THE WHOLE OF SICILY EXCEPT THE AGRIGENTINES WHO WERE NEUTRAL NOW CEASED MERELY TO WATCH EVENTS AS IT HAD HITHERTO DONE AND ACTIVELY JOINED SYRACUSE AGAINST THE ATHENIANS WHILE THE SYRACUSANS AFTER THE SICEL DISASTER
INDEED THERE WAS NO END TO THE CONTRIVANCES TO WHICH THEY RESORTED AGAINST EACH OTHER AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED BETWEEN TWO HOSTILE ARMIES CONFRONTING EACH OTHER AT SUCH A SHORT DISTANCE AND SKIRMISHES AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER ATTEMPTS WERE OF CONSTANT OCCURRENCE
WHERE THEY FOUND THE PARTY HOSTILE TO ATHENS RECENTLY EXPELLED
THE ATHENIANS TREATED THIS PROPOSITION WITH CONTEMPT AND DISMISSED THE HERALD WITHOUT AN ANSWER AFTER THIS BOTH SIDES BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR ACTION GYLIPPUS OBSERVING THAT THE SYRACUSANS WERE IN DISORDER AND DID NOT EASILY FALL INTO LINE
FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER THAT ANY SHIP THAT WAS HARD PRESSED MIGHT BE ABLE TO RETREAT IN SAFETY AND SAIL OUT AGAIN AT LEISURE THESE PREPARATIONS OCCUPIED THE ATHENIANS ALL DAY UNTIL NIGHTFALL
AND ACCORDINGLY SAILED TO AEGINA AND THERE WAITED FOR THE REMAINDER OF HIS ARMAMENT AND FOR CHARICLES TO FETCH THE ARGIVE TROOPS IN SICILY ABOUT THE SAME TIME IN THIS SPRING GYLIPPUS CAME TO SYRACUSE WITH AS MANY TROOPS AS HE COULD BRING FROM THE CITIES
OF EXHAUSTING ALL OUR STRENGTH UPON THE BLOCKADE
HIMSELF ALSO SENT TO ATHENS HE HAD BEFORE SENT FREQUENT REPORTS OF EVENTS AS THEY OCCURRED AND FELT IT ESPECIALLY INCUMBENT UPON HIM TO DO SO NOW AS HE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE IN A CRITICAL POSITION AND THAT UNLESS SPEEDILY RECALLED
IN ANY WAY THAT MIGHT OFFER EITHER IN MERCHANT VESSELS OR TRANSPORTS OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER LIKELY TO PROVE SUCCESSFUL
AND ISLANDERS WITH THE MOTLEY RABBLE THAT ACCOMPANIED THEM AND OF DRIVING THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY AFTER THIS HE EMBRACED THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED OF AGAIN LEADING THEM AGAINST THE ENEMY
HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS USE WERE NOW PREPARING TO DISPATCH A FORCE OF HEAVY INFANTRY
AND THE ATHENIANS IF HARD PRESSED BY CROWDING TOGETHER IN A SMALL SPACE AND ALL TO THE SAME POINT WOULD RUN FOUL OF ONE ANOTHER
A GOOD NUMBER WHO WERE AFTER PLUNDER WERE ACTUALLY CAUGHT IN THE TOWN AND PUT TO DEATH ALTOGETHER THE THRACIANS HAD TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY KILLED OUT OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED
DURING THE WINTER WITH THE MONEY FOR THE ARMY
THE ARMAMENT WITH WHICH HE WAS TO GO TO THE ISLAND
THEY ALSO VOTED TO SEND OUT ANOTHER ARMY AND NAVY DRAWN PARTLY FROM THE ATHENIANS ON THE MUSTER ROLL PARTLY FROM THE ALLIES
WE HAVE NOW THEREFORE BEEN FORCED BY THE NUMBERS OF THOSE OPPOSED TO US TO DISCONTINUE THE WORK OF CIRCUMVALLATION AND TO REMAIN INACTIVE BEING UNABLE TO MAKE USE EVEN OF ALL THE FORCE WE HAVE SINCE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR HEAVY INFANTRY
HERE ALSO CONON CAME TO THEM THE COMMANDER AT NAUPACTUS WITH NEWS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE CORINTHIAN SHIPS STATIONED OPPOSITE TO HIM FAR FROM GIVING OVER THE WAR WERE MEDITATING AN ENGAGEMENT
THE ATHENIANS NOW SAILED BACK TO NAUPACTUS AND THE CORINTHIANS IMMEDIATELY SET UP A TROPHY AS VICTORS BECAUSE THEY HAD DISABLED A GREATER NUMBER OF THE ENEMY'S SHIPS
ABOUT TWO MILES AND A QUARTER FROM ERINEUS THE CORINTHIAN STATION THIS WAS THE TERMINATION
OWING TO THE RECENT DEATH OF ARCHONIDAS A POWERFUL SICEL KING IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND FRIENDLY TO ATHENS AND OWING ALSO TO THE VIGOUR SHOWN
AND A VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF THE WAR BUT THE LACEDAEMONIANS DERIVED MOST ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE BELIEF THAT ATHENS WITH TWO WARS ON HER HANDS
THIS CHARGING PROW TO PROW WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN THOUGHT WANT OF SKILL IN A HELMSMAN WOULD BE THE SYRACUSANS CHIEF MANOEUVRE AS BEING THAT WHICH THEY SHOULD FIND MOST USEFUL
THE CAVALRY ATTACKED AND ROUTED THE LEFT WING OF THE ATHENIANS
WOULD BE MORE EASY TO SUBDUE AND FROM THE CONVICTION THAT SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO INFRINGE THE TRUCE IN THE FORMER WAR THEY CONSIDERED THE OFFENCE HAD BEEN MORE ON THEIR OWN SIDE BOTH ON ACCOUNT OF THE ENTRANCE OF THE THEBANS
SO THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO SAIL UP FOR FEAR OF RUNNING THE SHIPS UPON THEM JUST AS UPON A REEF THROUGH NOT SEEING THEM HOWEVER DIVERS WENT DOWN AND SAWED OFF EVEN THESE FOR REWARD ALTHOUGH THE SYRACUSANS DROVE IN OTHERS
TO MAKE USE OF THEM IF POSSIBLE IN THE VOYAGE ALONGSHORE TO INJURE THE ENEMY
TO BE TOLD THE BEST SIDE OF THINGS AND THEN TO BLAME THE TELLER IF THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH HE HAS RAISED IN YOUR MINDS ARE NOT ANSWERED BY THE RESULT AND I THEREFORE THOUGHT IT SAFEST TO DECLARE TO YOU THE TRUTH
THE ATHENIANS BROUGHT UP TO THEM A SHIP OF TEN THOUSAND TALENTS BURDEN FURNISHED WITH WOODEN TURRETS AND SCREENS AND FASTENED ROPES ROUND THE PILES FROM THEIR BOATS WRENCHED THEM UP AND BROKE THEM OR DIVED DOWN AND SAWED THEM IN TWO
AS WE ARE PREVENTED BY THEIR CAVALRY FROM EVEN GOING FOR ANY DISTANCE INTO THE COUNTRY BESIDES THIS AN EMBASSY HAS BEEN DISPATCHED TO PELOPONNESE TO PROCURE REINFORCEMENTS AND GYLIPPUS HAS GONE TO THE CITIES IN SICILY
AND SAILED AGAINST THEIR SIDES AND DISCHARGED FROM THENCE THEIR DARTS UPON THE SAILORS
THE ATHENIANS QUICKLY MANNED SIXTY SHIPS AND WITH TWENTY FIVE OF THESE ENGAGED THE THIRTY FIVE OF THE SYRACUSANS IN THE GREAT HARBOUR SENDING THE REST TO MEET THOSE SAILING ROUND FROM THE ARSENAL
AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE SELFSAME DAY TO ATTACK THE ATHENIANS AGAIN WHEN THEY WERE NOT EXPECTING IT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ADVICE A MESSENGER WAS SENT AND THE MARKET GOT READY UPON WHICH THE SYRACUSANS SUDDENLY BACKED WATER AND WITHDREW TO THE TOWN
RETIRING FROM THE LINES THE NEXT DAY THE SYRACUSANS REMAINED QUIET AND GAVE NO SIGNS OF WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO BUT NICIAS SEEING THAT THE BATTLE HAD BEEN A DRAWN ONE AND EXPECTING THAT THEY WOULD ATTACK AGAIN COMPELLED THE CAPTAINS TO REFIT ANY OF THE SHIPS THAT HAD SUFFERED
THE PLACE OFF WHICH THEY LAY BEING IN THE FORM OF A CRESCENT THE LAND FORCES FURNISHED BY THE CORINTHIANS AND THEIR ALLIES ON THE SPOT CAME UP AND RANGED THEMSELVES UPON THE PROJECTING HEADLANDS ON EITHER SIDE WHILE THE FLEET
WITH TEN SHIPS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TALENTS OF SILVER AND INSTRUCTIONS TO TELL THE ARMY THAT REINFORCEMENTS WOULD ARRIVE AND THAT CARE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THEM
MEANWHILE THE ATHENIANS RECOVERING FROM THE CONFUSION INTO WHICH THEY HAD
WITH A GREAT MANY SHIPS IN NOT MUCH ROOM WAS ALSO A FACT IN THEIR FAVOUR CHARGING PROW TO PROW THEY WOULD STAVE IN THE ENEMY'S BOWS BY
INDEED THEY MAY BE SEEN EXERCISING AND IT LIES WITH THEM TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE AND NOT HAVING TO MAINTAIN A BLOCKADE THEY HAVE GREATER FACILITIES FOR DRYING THEIR SHIPS
AND SENT FOR TROOPS TO THE ALLIES AND MEANWHILE GOT TOGETHER MONEY SHIPS AND HEAVY INFANTRY AT HOME THE ATHENIANS ALSO SENT TWENTY VESSELS ROUND PELOPONNESE TO PREVENT ANY ONE CROSSING OVER TO SICILY FROM CORINTH OR PELOPONNESE
PUT OFF ANY IMMEDIATE ATTACK UPON THE ATHENIANS DEMOSTHENES AND EURYMEDON
IF IT IS DESIRABLE FOR YOU TO KNOW THE REAL STATE OF THINGS HERE BEFORE TAKING YOUR MEASURES
IT WOULD BECOME IMPOSSIBLE THE LOSSES WHICH OUR CREWS HAVE SUFFERED AND STILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER ARISE FROM THE FOLLOWING CAUSES
SUDDENLY THE SYRACUSANS HAD MANNED THEIR SHIPS AND AGAIN SAILED AGAINST THEM AND THE ATHENIANS IN GREAT CONFUSION AND MOST OF THEM FASTING GOT ON BOARD AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PUT OUT TO MEET THEM FOR SOME TIME BOTH PARTIES REMAINED ON THE DEFENSIVE WITHOUT ENGAGING
WHOSE CHEEKS HAD BEEN STRENGTHENED FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE AFTER AN ACTION OF THIS EVEN CHARACTER IN WHICH EITHER PARTY COULD CLAIM THE VICTORY
REST OF THE TIME THE ENEMY WAS NOW PERMANENTLY FIXED IN ATTICA AT ONE TIME IT WAS AN ATTACK IN FORCE AT ANOTHER IT WAS THE REGULAR GARRISON
CALLING THE SYRACUSANS TOGETHER HE TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST MAN AS MANY SHIPS AS POSSIBLE
AS THE ATHENIANS HAD USED THEM AS A MAGAZINE THERE WAS A LARGE STOCK OF GOODS AND CORN OF THE MERCHANTS INSIDE AND ALSO A LARGE STOCK BELONGING TO THE CAPTAINS THE MASTS AND OTHER FURNITURE OF FORTY GALLEYS BEING TAKEN BESIDES THREE GALLEYS WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN UP ON SHORE
AND SECONDLY THE ATHENIANS FOR WANT OF ROOM WOULD BE UNABLE TO USE THEIR FAVOURITE MANOEUVRE OF BREAKING THE LINE OR OF SAILING ROUND AS THE SYRACUSANS WOULD DO THEIR BEST NOT TO LET THEM DO THE ONE AND WANT OF ROOM WOULD PREVENT THEIR DOING THE OTHER
WHEN GYLIPPUS ARRIVED FROM LACEDAEMON WITH AN ARMY OBTAINED FROM PELOPONNESE AND FROM SOME OF THE CITIES IN SICILY IN OUR FIRST BATTLE WITH HIM WE WERE VICTORIOUS IN THE BATTLE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WE WERE OVERPOWERED BY A MULTITUDE OF CAVALRY AND DARTERS AND COMPELLED TO RETIRE WITHIN OUR LINES
THIS WAS THE FIRST AND CHIEF OCCASION OF THE LOSSES WHICH THE CREWS EXPERIENCED THE WATER WHICH THEY USED WAS SCARCE AND HAD TO BE FETCHED FROM FAR
THEY NOT HAVING LIKE THE SYRACUSANS THE WHOLE HARBOUR TO RETREAT OVER
THUS FULFILLING THE OBJECT FOR WHICH THEY HAD BEEN MANNED ORIGINALLY WHICH WAS TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE ATHENIANS FROM THE MERCHANTMEN TO THE GALLEYS
WHERE THE VESSELS WHICH BROUGHT THEM WERE LYING THE GREATEST SLAUGHTER TOOK PLACE WHILE THEY WERE EMBARKING AS THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM AND THOSE IN THE VESSELS ON SEEING
THEY RAZED BUT PUT IN ORDER AND GARRISONED THE TWO OTHERS IN THE CAPTURE OF THE FORTS A GREAT MANY MEN WERE KILLED AND MADE PRISONERS AND A GREAT QUANTITY OF PROPERTY WAS TAKEN IN ALL
AT THE SAME TIME THEY DISPATCHED DEMOSTHENES TO SICILY AS THEY HAD INTENDED
FOR OUR PRESENT CONFEDERATES NAXOS AND CATANA ARE INCAPABLE OF SUPPLYING US THERE IS ONLY ONE THING MORE WANTING TO OUR OPPONENTS I MEAN THE DEFECTION OF OUR ITALIAN MARKETS IF THEY WERE TO SEE YOU NEGLECT TO RELIEVE US FROM OUR PRESENT CONDITION
AND SO TO PROCEED WITHOUT DELAY TO SICILY WHILE CHARICLES WAITED UNTIL HE HAD COMPLETED THE FORTIFICATION OF THE PLACE AND LEAVING A GARRISON THERE RETURNED HOME SUBSEQUENTLY WITH HIS THIRTY SHIPS AND THE ARGIVES ALSO
THAT IS TO SAY THE HEAVY INFANTRY THAT
MAINTAINED WITH EQUAL TENACITY ON BOTH SIDES
IN THE SAME WAY AS THE CORINTHIANS HAD ALTERED THEIR PROWS BEFORE ENGAGING THE SQUADRON AT NAUPACTUS THE SYRACUSANS THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD THUS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE ATHENIAN VESSELS WHICH WERE NOT CONSTRUCTED WITH EQUAL STRENGTH BUT WERE SLIGHT IN THE BOWS
THE CORINTHIANS NOT PUTTING OUT AGAIN TO MEET THEM THE TWO COMBATANTS PARTED NO PURSUIT TOOK PLACE AND NO PRISONERS WERE MADE ON EITHER SIDE
AND AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE SYRACUSANS AND CORINTHIANS WHO WISHED FOR AN INVASION TO ARREST THE REINFORCEMENTS
NOT THE SAME AS AT FIRST BUT HAVING GROWN WITH THE WAR WHILE THEIR REVENUES DECAYED ACCORDINGLY NOT WISHING TO INCUR EXPENSE IN THEIR PRESENT WANT OF MONEY THEY SENT BACK AT ONCE THE THRACIANS WHO CAME TOO LATE FOR DEMOSTHENES
FOR REINFORCEMENTS WHILE THE SYRACUSANS PROCEEDED TO MAN A FLEET AND TO EXERCISE MEANING TO TRY THEIR FORTUNE IN THIS WAY ALSO AND GENERALLY BECAME EXCEEDINGLY CONFIDENT NICIAS PERCEIVING THIS AND SEEING THE STRENGTH OF THE ENEMY AND HIS OWN DIFFICULTIES DAILY INCREASING
AFTER THIS ARRIVING AT ZACYNTHUS AND CEPHALLENIA HE TOOK A BODY OF HEAVY INFANTRY ON BOARD AND SENDING FOR SOME OF THE MESSENIANS
WITH A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND SOMEONE TO SUCCEED ME AS A DISEASE IN THE KIDNEYS UNFITS ME FOR RETAINING MY POST I HAVE I THINK SOME CLAIM ON YOUR INDULGENCE
AND WHATEVER ELSE HAD BEFALLEN THEM BUT WHEN BESIDES THE RAVAGES FROM PYLOS WHICH WENT ON WITHOUT ANY INTERMISSION THE THIRTY ATHENIAN SHIPS CAME OUT FROM ARGOS AND WASTED PART OF EPIDAURUS
TO ALYZIA AND TO ANACTORIUM
AND UNAPPROACHED BY ANY IN SUDDENNESS AND IN HORROR
AND A HAND TO HAND FIGHT ENSUED BETWEEN THE LINES WHERE THE SYRACUSAN CAVALRY COULD BE OF NO USE AND THE SYRACUSANS AND THEIR ALLIES WERE DEFEATED AND TOOK UP THEIR DEAD UNDER TRUCE WHILE THE ATHENIANS ERECTED A TROPHY
THAT MIGHT AGREE TO JOIN THEM GO TO SYRACUSE BY LAND FINALLY THEY DETERMINED TO SAIL FOR HIMERA
TERRITORY A QUANTITY OF TIMBER FOR SHIPBUILDING WHICH HAD
IN ADDITION TO OTHER IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE FORMER SEA FIGHT WHICH THEY NOW ADOPTED IN THE EQUIPMENT OF THEIR NAVY THEY CUT DOWN THEIR PROWS TO A SMALLER COMPASS TO MAKE THEM MORE SOLID AND MADE THEIR CHEEKS STOUTER AND FROM THESE LET STAYS INTO THE VESSELS SIDES
WHEN UPON EVERY DISPUTE THAT AROSE AS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF ANY DOUBTFUL POINT IN THE TREATY THEIR OWN OFFERS OF ARBITRATION WERE ALWAYS REJECTED BY THE ATHENIANS THE LACEDAEMONIANS AT LENGTH DECIDED THAT ATHENS HAD NOW COMMITTED THE VERY SAME OFFENCE
MAKING IT HIS AIM NOW TO KEEP ON THE DEFENSIVE AND TO AVOID ANY UNNECESSARY DANGER
AND DRIVEN HEADLONG WITHIN THEIR LINES THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE SYRACUSANS CARRIED THEIR WALL UP TO THE ATHENIAN WORKS AND PASSED THEM THUS PUTTING IT OUT OF THEIR POWER ANY LONGER TO STOP THEM AND DEPRIVING THEM EVEN IF VICTORIOUS IN THE FIELD
MEANWHILE THE SYRACUSANS SENT EMBASSIES TO THE CITIES COMPOSED OF CORINTHIANS AMBRACIOTS AND LACEDAEMONIANS
WHO ESCAPED WERE CONDUCTED TO SYRACUSE ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE CAMARINAEANS ALSO CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF SYRACUSE WITH FIVE HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY THREE HUNDRED DARTERS AND AS MANY ARCHERS WHILE THE GELOANS SENT CREWS FOR FIVE SHIPS FOUR HUNDRED DARTERS AND TWO HUNDRED HORSE
THAN TO THEIR OWN DISORDER AND GENERALLY
THUS THEY HAVE RUINED THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR NAVY NOW I NEED NOT REMIND YOU THAT THE TIME DURING WHICH A CREW IS IN ITS PRIME IS SHORT AND THAT THE NUMBER OF SAILORS WHO CAN START A SHIP ON HER WAY AND KEEP THE ROWING IN TIME IS SMALL
THEIR COUNTRYMEN AT HOME SENT OFF AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE HEAVY INFANTRY IN THE MERCHANT VESSELS TO SICILY THE LACEDAEMONIANS FURNISHING A PICKED FORCE OF HELOTS AND
ONE OF THESE WENT TO PELOPONNESE WITH AMBASSADORS TO DESCRIBE THE HOPEFUL STATE OF THEIR AFFAIRS AND TO INCITE THE PELOPONNESIANS TO PROSECUTE THE WAR THERE
TO SICILY HAD GOT READY FOR ENGAGING AND MANNING SOME ADDITIONAL VESSELS SO AS TO BE NUMERICALLY LITTLE INFERIOR
AND ACCORDINGLY REMAINED THERE TO MUSTER AND REVIEW THE WHOLE ARMY TO SEE IF ANY HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND TO PREVAIL UPON THE THURIANS RESOLUTELY TO JOIN THEM IN THEIR EXPEDITION
THE SICYONIANS ALSO SENT OFF TWO HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY AT SAME TIME AS THE CORINTHIANS UNDER THE COMMAND OF SARGEUS A SICYONIAN
WITHOUT ITS BEING LOST IN TRANSMISSION AND BE ABLE TO DECIDE UPON THE REAL FACTS OF THE CASE HIS EMISSARIES ACCORDINGLY DEPARTED WITH THE LETTER AND THE REQUISITE VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS AND HE ATTENDED TO THE AFFAIRS OF THE ARMY
SOME THOUGHT MIGHT HOLD OUT ONE YEAR SOME TWO NONE MORE THAN THREE IF THE PELOPONNESIANS INVADED THEIR COUNTRY NOW SEVENTEEN YEARS AFTER THE FIRST INVASION AFTER HAVING ALREADY SUFFERED FROM ALL THE EVILS OF WAR
OF GYLIPPUS AND THE SYRACUSANS FORMED IN ORDER OF BATTLE GYLIPPUS HALTED AT A SHORT DISTANCE OFF AND SENT ON A HERALD TO TELL THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD EVACUATE SICILY WITH BAG AND BAGGAGE WITHIN FIVE DAYS TIME HE WAS WILLING TO MAKE A TRUCE ACCORDINGLY
AS THE ATHENIANS WERE EXPECTED WITH A FRESH ARMY AND IF THE ONE ALREADY THERE COULD BE DESTROYED BEFORE THE OTHER ARRIVED THE WAR WOULD BE AT AN END WHILE THE CONTENDING PARTIES IN SICILY WERE THUS ENGAGED DEMOSTHENES HAVING NOW GOT TOGETHER
TO PREVENT PLUNDERING INCURSIONS ON THE PART OF THE ATHENIANS AT PLEMMYRIUM
A SORT OF ISTHMUS TO WHICH THE HELOTS
AND AT THE BIG STOUT FIGURE OF PIERRE WHO HANGING HIS HEAD MEEKLY FOLLOWED HER
YOU MUST NOT SPEAK AT ALL
MISTER BICKERSDYKE SEEMED ABOUT TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION AT THIS POINT BUT PSMITH WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND HURRIED ON WE FIND THAT THE SUN STILL SHINES THE BIRDS STILL SING
A GRAND BAT THAT BOY I SAID SO LAST SUMMER BETTER THAN ANY OF HIS BROTHERS
AND SAT DOWN IN THE LADY'S CHAIR PLACING HIS HUGE HANDS SYMMETRICALLY ON HIS KNEES IN THE NAIVE ATTITUDE OF AN EGYPTIAN STATUE AND DECIDED IN HIS OWN MIND THAT ALL WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
BUT I INTEND TO ACQUIRE A KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW WHICH SHALL OUTWEIGH THIS DEFECT BEFORE LEAVING YOU I SHOULD LIKE TO SAY I MAY SPEAK FOR YOU AS WELL AS MYSELF COMRADE JACKSON
WITH ITS LARGE BUST AND FULL LENGTH PORTRAIT OF CATHERINE THE GREAT THE SAME PEOPLE
LITTLE BY LITTLE WE COME TO OURSELVES AGAIN LIFE WHICH WE HAD THOUGHT COULD HOLD NO MORE PLEASURE FOR US GRADUALLY SHOWS ITSELF NOT WHOLLY GREY
BUT NOW HE HAD SLIPPED TO GO OFF AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE THE PROPER TIME AND TO REFUSE TO RETURN WHEN SUMMONED BY THE HEAD OF HIS DEPARTMENT THESE WERE OFFENCES FOR WHICH HE COULD BE DISMISSED WITHOUT FUSS
VIA THE POSTAGE AND INWARDS BILLS DEPARTMENTS TOOK HIM TO THE SWING DOORS IT WAS HERE THAT THE DANGER BECAME ACUTE THE DOORS WERE WELL WITHIN VIEW OF THE FIXED DEPOSITS DEPARTMENT
AND BEGIN IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME SAID THE MANAGER I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD SAY IT AND GO
THE EPISODE HAD BEEN DISTURBING HE WAS TO MEET HIS FATHER AT THE MANSION HOUSE
ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU IN SHORT PLEASE TO TELL ME FOR AS I HAPPEN TO POSSESS IN A SMALL DEGREE THE SIX SUPERNATURAL POWERS I AM ABLE TO GRATIFY ALMOST ANY WISH THAT YOU CAN EXPRESS
MADE VISIBLE BY A SINGLE RAY OF LIGHT THAT SHOT FROM THE FOREHEAD OF THE BLESSED ONE TO PIERCE BEYOND UTTERMOST TIME THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND
I AM THE KITE THAT THOSE CRUEL BOYS WERE TORMENTING AT KITA NO OJI YOU SAVED MY LIFE AND THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS WORLD MORE PRECIOUS THAN LIFE SO I NOW WISH TO RETURN YOUR KINDNESS IN SOME WAY OR OTHER
AH MY FRIEND SHE SAID TOUCHING HIS ARM AS SHE HAD DONE HER SON'S WHEN SPEAKING TO HIM THAT AFTERNOON BELIEVE ME I SUFFER NO LESS THAN YOU DO BUT BE A MAN
THIRTY AT LUNCH TIME HE WOULD APPEAR TO BE MAKING SOMETHING OF A STAND WITH HIS BROTHER JOE WHO HAS MADE SIXTY ONE UP TO THE MOMENT OF GOING TO PRESS IT'S POSSIBLE HE MAY STILL BE IN WHEN WE GET THERE IN WHICH CASE WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO SLIDE INTO THE PAVILION
ARE LEAVING THE BANK I AM AWARE OF THAT SAID MISTER BICKERSDYKE DRILY PSMITH PUT DOWN THE GLASS YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD ALREADY HE SAID THAT ACCOUNTS FOR YOUR CALM
THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TENGU BUT ALL ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MOUNTAIN HAUNTING SPIRITS CAPABLE OF ASSUMING MANY FORMS AND OCCASIONALLY APPEARING AS CROWS VULTURES OR EAGLES
AT ANY MOMENT MISTER GREGORY'S HOARSE ROAR MIGHT SHATTER THE COMPARATIVE STILLNESS OR THE SINISTER NOTE OF MISTER BICKERSDYKE MAKE ITSELF HEARD
AND HE TURNED TO GO BUT PIERRE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO ASK HOW IS AND HESITATED NOT KNOWING WHETHER IT WOULD BE PROPER TO CALL THE DYING MAN
AND THE GODS OF THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE WIND AND THE SHINING MYRIADS OF BRAHMA'S HEAVEN AND INCOMPARABLY FURTHER THAN EVEN THE MEASURELESS CIRCLING OF THE GLORY OF THESE HE SAW
MISTER GREGORY WAS LEANING OVER THE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDED HIS LAIR FROM THE OUTER WORLD AND GESTICULATING VIOLENTLY WHERE ARE YOU GOING ROARED THE HEAD OF THE FIXED DEPOSITS
INSTANTLY WITH A SHOCK AS OF EARTHQUAKE THE STUPENDOUS SPECTACLE DISAPPEARED AND THE PRIEST FOUND HIMSELF ALONE IN THE DARK KNEELING UPON THE GRASS OF THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
AND HAD GONE UPON HIS WAYS GRINNING AT ME
A STRANGE LADY THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TO THE PRIESTS ROSE AND OFFERED HIM HER SEAT AN AIDE DE CAMP PICKED UP AND RETURNED A GLOVE PIERRE HAD DROPPED
A VENDOR OF NEWSPAPERS CAME TO THE CAB THRUSTING AN EVENING PAPER INTO THE INTERIOR PSMITH BOUGHT IT LET'S SEE HOW THEY'RE GETTING ON HE SAID OPENING THE PAPER WHERE ARE WE
AND THE BEINGS IN EACH OF THE SIX STATES OF EXISTENCE AND EVEN THE SHAPES OF THE BUDDHAS EXTINCT THAT HAD ENTERED INTO NIRVANA THESE AND ALL THE GODS
REASON SUGGESTED THAT THERE WERE PROBABLY ONE OR TWO KNOCKING ABOUT SOMEWHERE BUT THIS WAS NO TIME TO THINK OF THEM HE EXAMINED THE FUTURE AND FOUND IT GOOD
LUNCH SCORES LORD'S
SHE HURRIEDLY ASCENDED THE NARROW DIMLY LIT STONE STAIRCASE CALLING TO PIERRE WHO WAS LAGGING BEHIND TO FOLLOW THOUGH
AS HE WALKED DELICATELY NOT COURTING OBSERVATION HE REMINDED HIMSELF OF THE HERO OF PILGRIM'S PROGRESS ON ALL SIDES OF HIM LAY FEARSOME BEASTS LYING IN WAIT TO POUNCE UPON HIM
LET US DO IT NOW
AND ALSO TO PICK UP THE GLOVE HIMSELF AND TO PASS ROUND THE DOCTORS WHO WERE NOT EVEN IN HIS WAY BUT ALL AT ONCE HE FELT THAT THIS WOULD NOT DO AND THAT TONIGHT
IT IS AS WELL TO CLOSE THE CHAPTER HOW IT HAPPENED IT IS HARD TO SAY BUT SOMEHOW I FANCY I DID NOT PRECISELY HIT IT OFF WITH COMRADE BICKERSDYKE WITH PSMITH THE WORKER HE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND
WITH THEIR COUNTLESS FOLLOWING GODS DEMONS NAGAS GOBLINS MEN AND BEINGS NOT HUMAN SARIPUTRA HE SAW AND KASYAPA AND ANANDA
LIKE A DASHED APE A MOST UNJUST DESCRIPTION OF THE SAD SWEET SMILE WHICH PSMITH HAD BESTOWED UPON HIM FROM THE DOORWAY
BUT I THINK WE MAY SAY THAT WE ARE WELL OUT OF THE PLACE MIKE'S MIND ROAMED INTO THE FUTURE
I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME MYSELF IN HIS PLACE PSMITH SMOOTHED HIS WAISTCOAT
NOT ALTOGETHER SORRY THAT WE DID NOT SAID PSMITH I HAVE ENJOYED THE CHANCES MY COMMERCIAL LIFE HAS GIVEN ME OF ASSOCIATING WITH SUCH A MAN AS COMRADE BICKERSDYKE IN MANY WAYS A MASTER MIND BUT PERHAPS
THE PROBLEM OF LIFE SEEMED TO HIM TO BE SOLVED HE LOOKED ON DOWN THE YEARS
MOREOVER MISTER GREGORY DEPOSED THE ERRANT ONE SEEN SLIDING OUT OF THE SWINGING DOOR AND SUMMONED IN A LOUD CLEAR VOICE TO COME BACK HAD FLATLY DISOBEYED
MISTER BICKERSDYKE LOOKED FORWARD TO TOMORROW'S INTERVIEW WITH HIS EMPLOYEE MEANWHILE HAVING ENJOYED AN EXCELLENT DINNER HE WAS NOW AS PSMITH HAD PREDICTED
BUT REALLY HADN'T I BETTER GO AWAY HE ASKED
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING TIRED OF IT NOT PRECISELY TIRED BUT
HE WAS A PERSON OBLIGED TO PERFORM SOME SORT OF AWFUL RITE WHICH EVERYONE EXPECTED OF HIM AND THAT HE WAS THEREFORE BOUND TO ACCEPT THEIR SERVICES HE TOOK THE GLOVE IN SILENCE FROM THE AIDE DE CAMP
IN ANY CASE IT IS SAFEST TO HAVE A PICK ME UP HANDY HE PAID THE WAITER AND ADVANCED ACROSS THE ROOM FOLLOWED BY MIKE IN HIS HAND EXTENDED AT ARM'S LENGTH
MIKE RESPONDED TO THE CALL WITHOUT HESITATION
PROCLAIMING THE PERFECT WAY THEN THE PRIEST OPENING HIS EYES IN A GREAT RADIANCE PERCEIVED THAT ALL THINGS HAD BEEN CHANGED THE PLACE WAS INDEED THE VULTURE PEAK
THE PRIEST GLADLY PROMISED TO FOLLOW THESE INJUNCTIONS AND THE TENGU HURRIED AWAY AS IF TO PREPARE THE SPECTACLE THE DAY WANED AND PASSED AND THE DARKNESS CAME BUT THE OLD PRIEST WAITED PATIENTLY BENEATH A TREE
THEY HAD CAUGHT THE BIRD IN A SNARE AND WERE BEATING IT WITH STICKS OH THE POOR CREATURE COMPASSIONATELY EXCLAIMED THE PRIEST WHY DO YOU TORMENT IT SO CHILDREN
THE DOCTOR CAST A RAPID GLANCE UPWARDS AND SILENTLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
ADDRESSING A MAID WHO WAS HURRYING PAST WITH A DECANTER ON A TRAY AS MY DEAR AND MY SWEET ASKED ABOUT THE PRINCESS HEALTH AND THEN LED PIERRE ALONG A STONE PASSAGE
BUT IT SEEMED TO ME SOMETIMES DURING OUR FESTIVE EVENINGS TOGETHER AT THE CLUB THAT ALL WAS NOT WELL FROM LITTLE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SIGNS I HAVE SUSPECTED NOW AND THEN THAT HE WOULD JUST AS SOON HAVE BEEN WITHOUT MY COMPANY
THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL TO BE SAID FOR THE BAR AS A CAREER PSMITH KNEW HIS FATHER
HAVING SAID THIS SHE WENT UP TO THE DOCTOR DEAR DOCTOR SAID SHE THIS YOUNG MAN IS THE COUNT'S SON IS THERE ANY HOPE
HOWEVER SAID PSMITH PHILOSOPHICALLY THESE ARE LIFE'S TRIALS AND MUST BE BORNE PATIENTLY A ROUNDABOUT ROUTE
WITH ALL HER MIGHT THIS ACTION WAS SO UNLIKE HER USUAL COMPOSURE AND THE FEAR DEPICTED ON PRINCE VASILI'S FACE SO OUT OF KEEPING WITH HIS DIGNITY
NEVER A DAY PASSES IN WHICH THIS REGRET DOES NOT COME TO ME IN THE HOUR OF MORNING OR OF EVENING PRAYER AH MY FRIEND IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO CONQUER TIME AND SPACE LIKE THE BODHISATTVAS
MERCY AND POINTING OUT A SMALL SOFA FOR HIM TO SIT AND WAIT FOR HER SHE WENT SILENTLY TOWARD THE DOOR THAT EVERYONE WAS WATCHING
BEGAN PSMITH IN A LOW SORROWFUL VOICE AND IT MUST NOT BE SHIRKED HAVE I YOUR EAR MISTER BICKERSDYKE ADDRESSED THUS DIRECTLY
THE DYING MAN WISHED TO SEE HER OWN ADMISSION WAS ASSURED CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AT ALL THOSE IN THE ROOM AND NOTICING THE COUNT'S CONFESSOR THERE SHE GLIDED UP TO HIM WITH A SORT OF AMBLE
BUT HE DECIDED THAT ALL THESE THINGS HAD TO BE FROM THE PASSAGE THEY WENT INTO A LARGE DIMLY LIT ROOM ADJOINING THE COUNT'S RECEPTION ROOM
THIS IS UNMANLY COMRADE BICKERSDYKE HE SAID I HAD NOT EXPECTED THIS THAT YOU SHOULD BE DAZED BY THE SHOCK WAS NATURAL
ASKED ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OF ONE OF THEM YES REPLIED A FOOTMAN IN A BOLD LOUD VOICE AS IF ANYTHING WERE NOW PERMISSIBLE THE DOOR TO THE LEFT MA'AM
NOR THE COACHMAN WHO COULD NOT HELP SEEING THESE PEOPLE TOOK ANY NOTICE OF THEM IT SEEMS TO BE ALL RIGHT PIERRE CONCLUDED AND FOLLOWED ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA
SO THAT NOW I CANNOT FLY AND WITH THESE WORDS THE TENGU VANISHED FOREVER
AND ALL THE DEMONS HE SAW BOW DOWN BEFORE THE LION THRONE AND HE HEARD THAT MULTITUDE INCALCULABLE OF BEINGS PRAISING THE SUTRA OF THE LOTOS OF THE GOOD LAW LIKE THE ROAR OF A SEA BEFORE THE LORD
WAS DRIVING INTO THE COURT OF COUNT BEZUKHOV'S HOUSE AS THE WHEELS ROLLED SOFTLY OVER THE STRAW BENEATH THE WINDOWS
ALL WE RELATIVES HAVE BEEN IN SUCH ANXIETY THIS YOUNG MAN IS THE COUNT'S SON SHE ADDED MORE SOFTLY WHAT A TERRIBLE MOMENT
REALLY I CANNOT REMEMBER TO HAVE EVER SEEN YOU BEFORE PLEASE TELL ME WHO YOU ARE IT IS NOT WONDERFUL THAT YOU CANNOT RECOGNIZE ME IN THIS FORM RETURNED THE MONK
THERE WAS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF WORK STILL TO BE DONE IN THE FIXED DEPOSITS DEPARTMENT WORK IN WHICH BY RIGHTS AS MIKE'S UNDERSTUDY HE SHOULD HAVE LENT A SYMPATHETIC AND HELPING HAND
BUT WHAT OF THAT HE MUSED THOUGHTFULLY SMOOTHING HIS HAT WITH HIS KNUCKLES COMRADE GREGORY IS A MAN WHO TAKES SUCH AN ENTHUSIASTIC PLEASURE IN HIS DUTIES
PSMITH RELATED BRIEFLY THE HISTORY OF MIKE'S DEPARTURE MISTER SMITH LISTENED WITH INTEREST WELL HE SAID AT LAST
THIS STORY MAY BE FOUND IN THE CURIOUS OLD JAPANESE BOOK CALLED JIKKUN SHO THE SAME LEGEND HAS FURNISHED THE SUBJECT OF AN INTERESTING NO PLAY CALLED DAI E THE GREAT ASSEMBLY
OUR PLACE IS ELSEWHERE HE ROSE MIKE FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE WITH ALACRITY
ENGAGED WITH A CIGAR AND A CUP OF COFFEE IN THE LOWER SMOKING ROOM OF THE SENIOR CONSERVATIVE CLUB PSMITH AND MIKE ENTERED THE ROOM WHEN HE WAS ABOUT HALF THROUGH THESE LUXURIES PSMITH'S FIRST ACTION WAS TO SUMMON A WAITER
HE ENTERED THE CAB WITH SOMETHING OF THE STATELINESS OF AN OLD ROMAN EMPEROR BOARDING HIS CHARIOT AND SETTLED HIMSELF COMFORTABLY IN HIS SEAT MISTER SMITH DIVED IN LIKE A RABBIT
THAT THIS WAS NO MORE THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED BE A MAN MY FRIEND I WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR INTERESTS SAID SHE IN REPLY TO HIS LOOK
IT HAD TO BE HOWEVER THE BANK WAS NO PLACE FOR US AN EXCELLENT CAREER IN MANY RESPECTS BUT UNSUITABLE FOR YOU AND ME IT IS HARD ON COMRADE BICKERSDYKE ESPECIALLY AS HE TOOK SUCH TROUBLE TO GET ME INTO IT
THAT PIERRE STOPPED AND GLANCED INQUIRINGLY OVER HIS SPECTACLES AT HIS GUIDE ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA EVINCED NO SURPRISE SHE ONLY SMILED FAINTLY AND SIGHED AS IF TO SAY
AND HE SET THE BIRD FREE IT HAD NOT BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT AND WAS ABLE TO FLY AWAY HAPPY AT HAVING PERFORMED THIS BUDDHIST ACT OF MERIT THE PRIEST THEN RESUMED HIS WALK
PERHAPS THE COUNT DID NOT ASK FOR ME SAID PIERRE WHEN HE REACHED THE LANDING I'D BETTER GO TO MY OWN ROOM ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA PAUSED AND WAITED FOR HIM TO COME UP
AND THAT IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE HIS HEAD AND DO FOOLISH THINGS HE MUST NOT ACT ON HIS OWN IDEAS TONIGHT BUT MUST YIELD HIMSELF UP ENTIRELY TO THE WILL OF THOSE WHO WERE GUIDING HIM
AND MISTER GREGORY HAD AN EYE COMPARED WITH WHICH THAT OF AN EAGLE WAS MORE OR LESS BLEARED PSMITH SAUNTERED TO THE DOOR AND PUSHED IT OPEN IN A GINGERLY MANNER
HAD PLUNGED INTO HIS ROOM WITH A LONG STATEMENT OF HOW PSMITH DEPUTED TO HELP IN THE LIFE AND THOUGHT OF THE FIXED DEPOSITS DEPARTMENT HAD LEFT THE BUILDING AT FOUR O'CLOCK
MISTER SMITH HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THEN MADE UP HIS MIND VERY WELL HE SAID I REALLY THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA THERE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES OPEN TO A BARRISTER I WISH WE HAD THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE I AM
HE REMOVED HIS HAT
WHERE'S A CAB HI CABBY NO THAT ONE'S GOT SOME ONE IN IT THERE'S ANOTHER HI HERE LUNATIC ARE YOU BLIND GOOD HE'S SEEN US
ONE OF THE BOYS MADE ANSWER WE WANT TO KILL IT TO GET THE FEATHERS MOVED BY PITY THE PRIEST PERSUADED THE BOYS TO LET HIM HAVE THE KITE IN EXCHANGE FOR A FAN THAT HE WAS CARRYING
PIERRE HAD NEVER BEEN IN THIS PART OF THE HOUSE AND DID NOT EVEN KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THESE ROOMS
KEEPING PIERRE CLOSE BESIDE HER ENTERED THE ROOM EVEN MORE BOLDLY THAN THAT AFTERNOON SHE FELT THAT AS SHE BROUGHT WITH HER THE PERSON
AND ONLY LATER GRASPED THAT A STROKE WAS AN ATTACK OF ILLNESS PRINCE VASILI SAID SOMETHING TO LORRAIN IN PASSING AND WENT THROUGH THE DOOR ON TIPTOE
CERTAINLY MY BOY SAID MISTER SMITH SENIOR
WHILE THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE GOING ON IN THE RECEPTION ROOM AND THE PRINCESS ROOM A CARRIAGE CONTAINING PIERRE WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR
CASTING SIGNIFICANT LOOKS AT HIM WITH A KIND OF AWE AND EVEN SERVILITY
WITH SAMANTABHADRA AT HIS RIGHT HAND AND MANJUSRI AT HIS LEFT AND BEFORE THEM ASSEMBLED IMMEASURABLY SPREADING INTO SPACE LIKE A FLOOD OF STARS THE HOSTS OF THE MAHASATTVAS AND THE BODHISATTVAS
ONE IS PRACTICALLY A HUNTED HARE EITHER THE HEADS OF MY DEPARTMENT MUST REFRAIN FROM VIEW HALLOOS WHEN THEY OBSERVE ME GOING FOR A STROLL OR I ABANDON COMMERCE FOR SOME LESS EXACTING WALK IN LIFE
HALFWAY UP THE STAIRS THEY WERE ALMOST KNOCKED OVER BY SOME MEN WHO CARRYING PAILS CAME RUNNING DOWNSTAIRS THEIR BOOTS CLATTERING THESE MEN PRESSED CLOSE TO THE WALL
YOU MUST NOT BOW DOWN NOR PRAY NOR UTTER
OF THE SAME KIND HIDING IN THE SHADOW OF THE HOUSE ON BOTH SIDES
URGED PSMITH SYMPATHETICALLY HOLDING OUT THE GLASS BE BRAVE HE WENT ON RAPIDLY TIME SOFTENS THE HARSHEST BLOWS
THE ELDEST PRINCESS FOLLOWED HIM AND THE PRIESTS AND DEACONS AND SOME SERVANTS ALSO WENT IN AT THE DOOR THROUGH THAT DOOR
HE SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN THINNER SINCE THE MORNING HIS EYES SEEMED LARGER THAN USUAL WHEN HE GLANCED ROUND AND NOTICED PIERRE HE WENT UP TO HIM TOOK HIS HAND A THING HE NEVER USED TO DO
AND HEEDLESSLY ALLOWED YOUR FEELINGS TO OVERCOME YOU THE GOHOTENDO WHO IS THE GUARDIAN OF THE DOCTRINE SWOOPED DOWN SUDDENLY FROM HEAVEN UPON US
ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE PRIEST KNEW THAT HE WAS SPEAKING WITH A TENGU AND HE FRANKLY MADE ANSWER MY FRIEND I HAVE LONG CEASED TO CARE FOR THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD I AM NOW SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE
IN JAPANESE POPULAR ART THE TENGU ARE COMMONLY REPRESENTED EITHER AS WINGED MEN WITH BEAK SHAPED NOSES OR AS BIRDS OF PREY
ON THE MOUNTAIN CALLED HIYEI ZAN NEAR KYOTO ONE SUMMER DAY THIS GOOD PRIEST AFTER A VISIT TO THE CITY WAS RETURNING TO HIS TEMPLE BY WAY OF KITA NO OJI
NEITHER FAME NOR PLEASURE HAS ANY ATTRACTION FOR ME I FEEL ANXIOUS ONLY ABOUT MY FUTURE BIRTH BUT AS THAT IS A MATTER IN WHICH NO ONE CAN HELP ME IT WERE USELESS TO ASK ABOUT IT
ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S FACE EXPRESSED A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE DECISIVE MOMENT HAD ARRIVED WITH THE AIR OF A PRACTICAL PETERSBURG LADY SHE NOW
THIS BANK BUSINESS IS FAR FROM BEING MUCH OF A CATCH INDEED I SHOULD DESCRIBE IT DEFINITELY AS A BIT OFF I HAVE GIVEN IT A FAIR TRIAL AND I NOW DENOUNCE IT UNHESITATINGLY AS A SHADE TOO THICK
AND WENT STILL FASTER ALONG THE PASSAGE PIERRE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT AND STILL LESS WHAT WATCHING OVER HIS INTERESTS MEANT
AND THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH MANDARAVA AND MANJUSHAKA FLOWERS SHOWERED FROM HEAVEN AND THE NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH FRAGRANCE AND SPLENDOUR AND THE SWEETNESS OF THE GREAT VOICE AND IN MID AIR
HAVING TURNED WITH WORDS OF COMFORT TO HER COMPANION REALIZED THAT HE WAS ASLEEP IN HIS CORNER AND WOKE HIM UP ROUSING HIMSELF
THEN A SADNESS UNSPEAKABLE FELL UPON HIM BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF THE VISION
ALMOST CLOSING THE LATTER SIGHED AND MOVED AWAY FROM THE DOCTOR TO PIERRE TO HIM IN A PARTICULARLY RESPECTFUL AND TENDERLY SAD VOICE
TO LET PIERRE AND ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA PASS AND DID NOT EVINCE THE LEAST SURPRISE AT SEEING THEM THERE IS THIS THE WAY TO THE PRINCESSES APARTMENTS
THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PSMITH ESTATES SEEMS THE JOB ON WHICH HE CAN GET THE RAPID HALF NELSON FOR MY OWN PART I FEEL THAT MY LONG SUIT IS THE BAR I AM A POOR UNREADY SPEAKER
CRYING OUT HOW DO YE DARE THUS TO DECEIVE A PIOUS PERSON THEN THE OTHER MONKS WHOM I HAD ASSEMBLED ALL FLED IN FEAR AS FOR MYSELF ONE OF MY WINGS HAS BEEN BROKEN
THE BLOW TO THE MANAGEMENT ESPECIALLY TO COMRADE BICKERSDYKE WILL BE A PAINFUL ONE BUT IT IS THE TRUEST KINDNESS TO ADMINISTER IT SWIFTLY LET ME RESIGN TOMORROW AND DEVOTE MY TIME TO QUIET STUDY
AS SOON AS ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA HAD DISAPPEARED HE NOTICED THAT THE EYES OF ALL IN THE ROOM TURNED TO HIM WITH SOMETHING MORE THAN CURIOSITY AND SYMPATHY HE NOTICED THAT THEY WHISPERED TO ONE ANOTHER
WERE SITTING CLOSE TOGETHER TALKING SEEING THEM PASS
PITYINGLY THROUGH HIS EYEGLASS MIKE WHO FELT EMBARRASSED TOOK A SEAT SOME LITTLE WAY BEHIND HIS COMPANION THIS WAS PSMITH'S AFFAIR AND HE PROPOSED TO ALLOW HIM TO DO THE TALKING
WHILE HE WAS GETTING DOWN FROM THE CARRIAGE STEPS TWO MEN WHO LOOKED LIKE TRADESPEOPLE RAN HURRIEDLY FROM THE ENTRANCE AND HID IN THE SHADOW OF THE WALL PAUSING FOR A MOMENT
OUR RESOLVE AND RETURN TO THE BANK IS UNWORTHY OF YOU BE A MAN BITE THE BULLET THE FIRST KEEN PANG WILL PASS TIME WILL SOFTEN THE FEELING OF BEREAVEMENT YOU MUST BE BRAVE
WHAT
HE WENT ON AS IF HE WERE ADVISING A FRIEND ON SOME COURSE OF ACTION
THE DOCTORS BECAME RESPECTFULLY SILENT AS HE PASSED BY AND MOVED TO MAKE WAY FOR HIM
SAID PSMITH PERHAPS YOU ARE WISE IN A WORD THEN HE PICKED UP THE BRANDY AND HELD IT OUT TO HIM
BUT I ANSWERED THAT LAST QUESTION AS SOON AS I ASKED IT AND IN THE NEGATIVE FOR THE LIGHT OF MY LAMP SHOWED A FINE HEAVY GOLD WATCH CHAIN FESTOONED ACROSS THE MAN'S WAISTCOAT IF MURDEROUSLY INCLINED THIEVES HAD BEEN AT HIM
SO SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE WOULD WRITE MISSUS SMITH OR SEE HER TO SAY THAT YOU TOO ARE GOING TO BE MISSUS SMITH CHUCKLED THE ARCHDEACON'S COUSIN IN HIS DRY WAY WHICH MADE HIM SEEM EVEN OLDER THAN HE WAS
THAT'S WHAT KEPT ME RATHER LONG THAT AND WAITING FOR THE DRAGON TO GO OTHERWISE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN BEFORE RUTHVEN SMITH TRAPPED ME FOR A SECOND IT LOOKED AS IF THE GAME OF LIFE WAS UP AND THEN I FOUND OUT HOW MUCH YOU MEANT TO ME
EITHER IN THE SHAPE OF A CORONER OR A POLICEMAN ASKED ME ABOUT MY OWN ADVENTURES THAT NIGHT TO BE SURE I HAD SEEN A STRANGER AND I HAD OBSERVED THAT HE HAD LOST A COUPLE OF FINGERS THE FIRST AND SECOND OF HIS RIGHT HAND
ANNESLEY STAMMERED HER EYES APPEALING SEEKING TO EXPLAIN AND BEGGING PARDON BUT IF QUITE RIGHT WHY NOT TELL HE ANSWERED INSTANTLY HIS FIRST GLANCE OF SURPRISE TURNING TO CHEERFUL REASSURANCE
THAT'S JUST WHERE I'M COMING WITH YOU HE ANSWERED I'VE MY BICYCLE CLOSE BY AND WE'LL RIDE INTO THE TOWN TOGETHER AT ONCE FOR DO YOU SEE MISTER HUGH
AND CALLING TO ME LET ME KNOW THAT THEY WERE MAISIE DUNLOP AND HER BROTHER TOM THAT SHE HAD MADE TO COME WITH HER
WHAT'S IN A NAME WE MIGHT AS WELL BE IN REALITY WHAT WE PLAYED AT BEING TO NIGHT
EXCEPT THE RETURN HALF OF A RAILWAY TICKET BETWEEN PEEBLES AND COLDSTREAM AND A BIT OF A TORN BILL HEAD GIVING THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF A TRADESMAN IN DUNDEE THERE'S SOMETHING TO GO ON ANYWAY REMARKED CHISHOLM
OR A FEW YEARS AGO AND IN THE WAVE OF RELIEF WHICH OVERWHELMED HER ANNESLEY FORGOT RUTHVEN SMITH'S QUESTION AND HER ANSWER SHE REMEMBERED AGAIN ONLY WITH THE SHOCK OF HEARING HIM ADDRESS THE NEWCOMER BY THE NAME SHE HAD GIVEN
AND HAS LIVED IN THE ARGENTINE BUT I MET HER IN NEW YORK SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ME OR ENOUGH AND IF SHE'D BEEN IN THE RESTAURANT AT DINNER THIS EVENING SHE COULD HAVE DONE FOR ME WHAT YOU DID I HAD REASON TO THINK SHE WOULD BE THERE WHEN I BOLTED IN TO GET OUT OF A FIX
WHO ELSE SAID I CAN YOU THINK OF ANY OTHER THAT IT WOULD BE AND I'M WONDERING IF WHOEVER KILLED THIS FELLOW WHOEVER HE MAY BE WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED MISTER GILVERTHWAITE TOO IF HE'D COME
AFTERWARD YOU'LL BE NICE TO HER AND THAT WILL BE DOING HER A GOOD TURN BECAUSE SHE'S APT TO BE LONESOME IN LONDON
AND THAT MOMENT AS FRESHLY NOW AS IF THE AFFAIR HAD HAPPENED LAST NIGHT THE DEAD MAN LYING IN THE CRUSHED GRASS HIS ARMS THROWN OUT HELPLESSLY ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE GLOOM OF THE TREES ALL AROUND
IT FLASHED INTO THE GIRL'S MIND THAT IT WOULD BE PERFECT IF SHE COULD BE MARRIED TO HER KNIGHT BY ARCHDEACON SMITH BUT SHE HAD BEEN IMPRUDENT TOO OFTEN ALREADY SHE DARED NOT MAKE SUCH A SUGGESTION WITHOUT CONSULTING THE OTHER PERSON MOST CONCERNED
MISS GRAYLE AND I WILL GO TOGETHER TWO WOMEN ALONE AND INDEPENDENT LUCKY IT'S NOT THE SEASON OR WE MIGHT FIND NOTHING FREE AT SHORT NOTICE BUT DON I MEAN NELSON ALWAYS DID HAVE LUCK I HOPE HE ALWAYS WILL
HE'LL HAVE TO BE TAKEN TO THE NEAREST INN FOR THE INQUEST THAT'S HOW THE LAW IS I WASN'T GOING TO ASK IT WHILE YON MAN WAS ABOUT MISTER HUGH HE CONTINUED WHEN TURNDALE HAD GONE HURRYING TOWARDS THE VILLAGE
NOT CARING TO STAY LONGER FOR I HAD HEARD WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE SPOT BY A SINGLE BLOW FROM A KNIFE OR DAGGER WHICH HAD BEEN THRUST INTO HIS HEART FROM BEHIND WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE AND THE THOUGHT OF IT
SHE NOTICED THAT THIS HAND WAS AS WONDERFUL AS THE REST OF THE WOMAN'S PERSONALITY IT WAS VERY LONG VERY NARROW
NOW YOU MUST ENGAGE HER ROOM NELSON SMITH SAID ABRUPTLY IT'S LATE YOU CAN MAKE FRIENDS AFTERWARD VERY WELL THE COUNTESS AGREED AND YOU WILL YOU COME TO THE DESK YET NO IT IS BETTER NOT
AND MAKING UGLY PATCHES OF CRIMSON ON THE GRASS AND THE GRAVEL WOULD BE AN ORDINARY THING BUT TO ME THAT HAD NEVER SEEN BLOOD LET IN VIOLENCE EXCEPT IN SUCH MATTERS AS A BOUT OF FISTICUFFS AT SCHOOL
FOR IF HE KNOWS NO MORE HE'LL KNOW WHO YON MAN IS I MADE NO ANSWER TO THAT I HAD NO CERTAIN ANSWER TO MAKE I WAS ALREADY WONDERING ABOUT A LOT OF CONJECTURES
THAT WAS GOING TO KEEP ME BUSIED TILL DAY BROKE I SET TO IT THERE AND THEN LEAVING THE MAN JUST AS I HAD FOUND HIM AND HASTENING BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MAIN ROAD AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT I HEARD VOICES OF MEN ON TWIZEL BRIDGE
DRAWING ME ASIDE THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T ROB THE MAN OF HIS MONEY AND VALUABLES THEY TOOK SOMETHING ELSE FROM HIM THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OF MUCH MORE VALUE THAN EITHER WHAT I ASKED PAPERS SAID HE
AND HAD AS LIKE AS NOT BEEN TRAMPING IT OVER PLODDEN FIELD AND THAT HISTORIC CORNER OF THE COUNTRY AND HAD BECOME BENIGHTED ERE HE COULD REACH WHEREVER HIS HEADQUARTERS WERE AND I WAS NOT GOING TO BRING SUSPICION
MY ASSOCIATION WITH THOSE MEN IS ONE OF THE THINGS I LONG TO TURN THE KEY UPON I KNOW THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE BLUEBEARD TO FATIMA BUT IT ISN'T AS BAD AS THAT TO ME IT DOESN'T SEEM BAD AT ALL AND I SWEAR THAT WHATEVER MYSTERY
ALL THAT WAS WHAT AT MISTER GILVERTHWAITE'S BIDDING I HAD RIDDEN OUT FROM BERWICK TO FIND IN THAT LONELY SPOT BUT I KNEW OF COURSE THAT JAMES GILVERTHWAITE HIMSELF HAD NOT FORESEEN THIS AFFAIR
THIS IS NO BY CHANCE MURDER CHISHOLM AS YOU'LL BE FINDING OUT WELL WELL I NEVER KNEW ITS LIKE HE REMARKED STARING FROM ME TO THE BODY AND FROM IT TO ME
YOU COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF DESTINY AND ALL'S FOR THE BEST YOU WERE AN ANGEL TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF TO SAVE ME AND YOUR DOING IT THE WAY YOU DID HAS MADE ME A HAPPY MAN AT ONE STROKE AS FOR THE NAME
YET AGAIN WAS THIS SOME MAN WHO HAD COME UPON MISTER GILVERTHWAITE'S CORRESPONDENT AND FOR SOME REASON BEEN MURDERED BY HIM IT WAS HOWEVER ALL BEYOND ME JUST THEN AND PRESENTLY THE SERGEANT AND I WERE ON OUR MACHINES
AND IT'S NO CONCERN OF MINE TO KEEP IT BACK AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT NOT ME THE TRUTH IS WE'VE A LODGER AT OUR HOUSE ONE MISTER JAMES GILVERTHWAITE THAT'S A MYSTERIOUS SORT OF MAN
AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THIS POCKET BOOK WITH WHAT WAS IN IT THEY WERE AFTER AND NOT TROUBLING ABOUT HIS PURSE AT ALL THEY MADE SURE OF HIM ANYWAY SAID I AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM WHERE THEY HAD LAID THE BODY
SAID THE GIRL AND I'VE BEEN VERY FOOLISH I'VE COMPLICATED EVERYTHING FIRST BY WHAT I TOLD MISTER RUTHVEN SMITH ABOUT ABOUT US AND THEN SAYING YOUR NAME WAS NELSON SMITH YOU WEREN'T FOOLISH HE CONTRADICTED
AND CHISHOLM CLICKED HIS TONGUE SHARPLY AT WHAT HE SAW HERE'S A SORE SIGHT FOR HONEST FOLK HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AS HE BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED ONE OF THE HANDS
AND HE'S AT PRESENT IN HIS BED WITH A CHILL OR SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE TO KEEP HIM THERE AND TONIGHT HE GOT ME TO RIDE OUT HERE TO MEET A MAN WHOM HE OUGHT TO HAVE MET HIMSELF AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AND ALL THAT I HAVE TO DO WITH IT
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU MAKES ME FEEL AS IF I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WHENEVER I CAN AND THE TRUTH IS THAT FOR REASONS YOU MAY UNDERSTAND SOME DAY THOUGH I HOPE TO HEAVEN YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO
NELSON SMITH AND BEFORE THE WORDS HAD LEFT HER LIPS A TAXI DREW UP AT THE DOOR THERE WAS ONE INSTANT OF AGONY DURING WHICH THE PREVIOUS SUSPENSE SEEMED NOTHING AN INSTANT WHEN THE GIRL FORGOT WHAT SHE HAD SAID
AND YET IT DID NOT SEEM TO BE HERSELF BUT SOMETHING WITHIN STRONGER THAN SHE THAT SUDDENLY TOOK CONTROL OF HER WHY SHOULD I NOT WISH TO TELL YOU THE SOMETHING WAS SAYING THE NAME IS THE SAME AS YOUR OWN SMITH
AS HE CAREFULLY PUT THESE THINGS ASIDE AFTER POINTING OUT TO US THAT THE TICKET WAS DATED ON WHAT WAS NOW THE PREVIOUS DAY FOR IT WAS ALREADY WELL PAST MIDNIGHT AND THE TIME WAS CREEPING ON TO MORNING
AND I SHALL TAKE CARE YOU DON'T WAKE UP AFTERWARD THERE CAME A TIME WHEN ANNESLEY CALLED BACK THOSE WORDS AND WONDERED IF THEY HAD HELD A DEEPER MEANING THAN SHE GUESSED BUT HAVING UTTERED THEM
AND AGAIN THE GIRL HAD A FEW MOMENTS OF SUSPENSE THINKING OF THE DANGER WHICH MIGHT NOT AFTER ALL BE OVER JUST AS SHE HAD BEGUN TO BE ANXIOUS HOWEVER SHE SAW HIM COMING WITH A WONDERFUL WOMAN ANNESLEY COULD HAVE LAUGHED
I THINK THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN AND YOU WILL BE A LUCKY GIRL HE TOO WILL BE LUCKY I SEE THAT WITH ANOTHER SMILE ANNESLEY WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S VOICE WAS NOT SWEET
NOBODY PAID THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO THE NEWCOMERS AND ANNESLEY SETTLED DOWN UNOBTRUSIVELY IN A CORNER WHILE HER COMPANION WENT TO SCRIBBLE A LINE TO THE COUNTESS DE SANTIAGO WHEN HE HAD FINISHED AND SENT UP THE LETTER HE DID NOT RETURN
BUT IT HAD BEEN BORNE IN ON MY MIND PRETTY STRONGLY THAT THE MAN I HAD SEEN LOOKING AT HIS MAP WAS SOME GENTLEMAN TOURIST WHO WAS WALKING THE DISTRICT
IF YOU CALL IT MYSTERY' THERE IS ABOUT ME IT SHA'N'T HURT YOU WILL YOU BELIEVE THIS AND TRUST ME FOR THE REST I'VE TOLD YOU I WOULD THE GIRL REMINDED HIM I KNOW BUT THINGS WERE DIFFERENT THEN
NOT ONLY DID HE SHAKE HANDS BUT ACTUALLY CAME OUT TO THE TAXI WITH THEM ASKING ANNESLEY IF HE SHOULD TELL HIS COUSINS OF HER ENGAGEMENT OR IF SHE PREFERRED TO GIVE THE NEWS HERSELF
THOSE MEN I ASSURE YOU IT'S SAFER NOW THAN ANYWHERE IN LONDON THE MAN CUT HER SHORT I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS I COULD EXPLAIN IF I CARED TO RIG UP A STORY
HE OFFERED HIS HAND WITH A SMILE TO HIS NAMESAKE AND ANNESLEY REALIZED FROM THE OUTSIDER'S POINT OF VIEW THE PECULIAR ATTRACTION OF THE MAN RUTHVEN SMITH FELT IT AS SHE HAD FELT IT THOUGH DIFFERENTLY AND IN A LESSER DEGREE
I SUPPOSE YOU DID KNOW OR DID YOU CHANCE IT I WAS AS SURE AS I NEEDED TO BE NELSON SMITH ANSWERED A MOMENT AFTER I SWITCHED ON THE ELECTRICITY IN THE ROOM UP THERE I HEARD A TAXI DRIVE AWAY
AND THAT THE DEAD MAN MUST ACCORDINGLY HAVE COME TO COLDSTREAM NOT MANY HOURS BEFORE HIS DEATH AND WE'LL LIKELY FIND SOMETHING ABOUT HIM FROM EITHER DUNDEE OR PEEBLES BUT I'M INCLINED TO THINK MISTER HUGH HE CONTINUED
BUT IF I CAN GIVE YOU A HAPPY LIFE AND A FEW OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS YOU DESERVE WHY IT'S SOMETHING BESIDES I'M GOING TO WORSHIP MY PRINCESS I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO SHOW YOU HOW I BUT NO
LOOK AT THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE MAN HE'S NO COMMON OR ORDINARY SORT IS IT LIKELY NOW SUCH A MAN WOULD BE WITHOUT LETTERS AND THAT SORT OF THING IN HIS POCKETS LIKE AS NOT HE'D CARRY HIS POCKET BOOK
AND IT SEEMED VERY EVIDENT THAT ROBBERY HAD NOT BEEN THE MOTIVE OF THE MURDERERS BUT OF PAPERS THAT COULD IDENTIFY THE MAN THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE SHAPE OF PAPER OR ITS LIKE THERE WAS NOT ONE SCRAP IN ALL THE CLOTHING
EVEN IF I'D BEEN STOPPING THERE I SHOULD MOVE IF I WERE GOING TO PUT YOU IN THE HOTEL BUT I HAVE MY OWN LAIR IN LONDON I'VE BEEN OVER HERE A NUMBER OF TIMES INDEED I'M PARTLY ENGLISH BORN IN CANADA THOUGH I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES
HE SEEMED TO PUT THE THOUGHT OUT OF HIS MIND AND TURN TO THE NEXT ABOUT THE SAVOY HE WENT ON I WANT TO TAKE YOU THERE BECAUSE I KNOW A WOMAN STAYING IN THE HOTEL A WOMAN OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR MOTHER WHO'LL LOOK AFTER YOU TO PLEASE ME TILL WE'RE MARRIED
I'M NOT MUCH OF A PRINCESS BUT YOU ARE SAINT GEORGE SAINT GEORGE HE ECHOED A RING OF BITTERNESS UNDER HIS LAUGH THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN CALLED A SAINT AND I'M AFRAID IT WILL BE THE LAST I CAN'T LIVE UP TO THAT
WELL YOU CAN TRUST ME WITH MISSUS ELLSWORTH IF SHE GOES ON AS SHE BEGAN TO NIGHT I'M AFRAID I SHALL HAVE TO FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE FOLD MY TENT LIKE AN ARAB AND SILENTLY STEAL AWAY HA HA
I SAW NOBODY AND HEARD NOTHING ABOUT HERE SAID I IT'S NOT LIKELY THERE'D BE STRANGERS IN THIS SPOT AT MIDNIGHT FOR THAT MATTER THE POOR FELLOW IS A STRANGER HIMSELF SAID HE
EVEN THE THUMB WAS ABNORMALLY LONG WHICH FACT PREVENTED THE HAND FROM BEING AS BEAUTIFUL AS IT WAS SOMEHOW UNFORGETTABLE THIS IS A PLEASURE AND A SURPRISE BEGAN THE COUNTESS SMILING
UNTIL THE MOMENT YOU'RE MY WIFE MEANTIME I'LL TRY TO GROW A BIT MORE LIKE WHAT YOUR LOVER OUGHT TO BE AND LATER I SHALL KISS YOU ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IF FIVE HOURS AGO ANY ONE HAD TOLD ANNESLEY GRAYLE
WOULD MISTER GILVERTHWAITE KNOW WHO THE MAN WAS WAS HE THE MAN I OUGHT TO HAVE MET OR HAD THAT MAN BEEN THERE WITNESSED THE MURDER AND GONE AWAY FRIGHTENED TO STOP WHERE THE MURDER HAD BEEN DONE OR
HER EYES APPEARING TO TAKE IN THE FULL LENGTH PORTRAIT OF ANNESLEY GRAYLE WITH THEIR WIDE UNMOVING GAZE WHEN SHE SMILED SHE WAS STILL EXTREMELY HANDSOME BUT NOT SO PERFECT AS WITH LIPS CLOSED FOR HER WHITE TEETH WERE TOO SHORT SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR AND SET TOO WIDE APART
AND IF THEY WERE STILL LURKING ABOUT AND WATCHING ME FROM THE BRUSHWOOD AND I MADE AN EFFORT AND BENT DOWN AND TOUCHED ONE OF THE NERVELESS HANDS IT WAS STIFFENED ALREADY
AND I KNEW THEN THAT THE MAN HAD BEEN DEAD SOME TIME AND I KNEW ANOTHER THING IN THAT MOMENT POOR MAISIE LYING AWAKE TO LISTEN FOR THE TAP AT HER WINDOW SO THAT SHE MIGHT GET UP AND PEEP ROUND THE CORNER OF HER BLIND
THAT WE SHOULD SOON BE IN ANOTHER GOING BACK TO THE PLACE WE STARTED FROM THE SAVOY EXCLAIMED ANNESLEY
THEN YOU'LL BE PROVIDED WITH A CHAPERON I'M NOT ANXIOUS ABOUT MYSELF BUT ABOUT YOU ANNESLEY SAID YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME YET WHAT HAPPENED AFTER YOU WENT UPSTAIRS AT MISSUS ELLSWORTH'S AND HOW YOU KNEW THOSE MEN WERE GONE
ON WHAT WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY AN INNOCENT STRANGER SO I ANSWERED CHISHOLM'S QUESTION AS I MEANT TO ANSWER ANY SIMILAR ONE UNLESS INDEED I HAD REASON TO ALTER MY MIND
AND HAD ALMOND SHAPED DARK EYES WITH BROODING LASHES UNDER SLENDER BROWS THAT MET IN CONTRAST HER HAIR WAS OF A FLAME COLOUR VIVID AS HER DRAPERIES AND HER LIPS WERE RED AT FIRST GLANCE ANNESLEY THOUGHT THAT THE DAZZLING CREATURE COULD NOT BE MORE THAN THIRTY
WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE MET ANNESLEY THOUGHT ALOUD HOW STRANGE JUST THAT LITTLE THING YOUR FRIEND BEING OUT TO DINNER AND OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE TO BE CHANGED OH YOU MUST BE SORRY
REMEMBERING HOW HE HAD SAID THE COUNTESS WOULD MOTHER HER ANY ONE LESS MOTHERLY THAN THIS JUNO LIKE BEAUTY IN FLAME COLOURED CHIFFON OVER GOLD TISSUE IT WOULD BE HARD TO IMAGINE THE SPANISH SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTESS WAS OF A CAMELIA PALENESS
SHE SPOKE ENGLISH PERFECTLY WITH A SLIGHT FOREIGN ACCENT AND A ROLL OF THE LETTER R MY FRIEND NELSON SMITH SHE TURNED LAUGHING TO HIM HAS TOLD ME EX CITING NEWS WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER A LONG TIME
WHO HAD MET THERE IN THE COURSE OF THEIR NIGHT ROUNDS I KNEW THEM BOTH THE SERGEANT BEING ONE CHISHOLM AND THE CONSTABLE A MAN NAMED TURNDALE AND THEY KNEW ME WELL ENOUGH FROM HAVING SEEN ME IN THE COURT AT BERWICK
IT WAS THE BIGGEST THING THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED AND I STOOD STARING DOWN AT THE WHITE FACE AS IF I SHOULD NEVER LOOK AT ANYTHING ELSE AS LONG AS I LIVED I REMEMBER ALL ABOUT THAT SCENE
BY JOVE HE EXCLAIMED I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT IT'S A DIFFICULTY BUT WE'LL OBVIATE IT SOMEHOW DON'T WORRY ONLY I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T ASK YOUR FRIEND THE ARCHDEACON TO MARRY US AS I MEANT TO SUGGEST
SHE COULD NOT PARRY THE MAN'S QUESTIONS SHE COULD NOT BEAR HIS GRIEVED OR OFFENDED REPROACHES IF HE PERSISTED THROUGH THESE MOMENTS OF SUSPENSE SHE WOULD SCREAM OR BURST OUT CRYING TREMBLING WITH TEARS IN HER VOICE SHE HEARD HERSELF ANSWER
NOBODY AT THE SAVOY BUT THE COUNTESS DE SANTIAGO KNOWS WHO I AM AND SHE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT IT MAY BE CONVENIENT FOR ME TO CHANGE MY NAME NELSON SMITH IS A RESPECTABLE ONE AND SHE'LL RESPECT IT
THEY WERE NOT LIKE TO HAVE LEFT THAT THEN I WONDERED IF I HAD DISTURBED THE MURDERERS IT WAS FIXED IN ME FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE IN AT THIS DREADFUL GAME
THE MURMURING OF THE WATERS WHERE TILL WAS POURING ITS SLUGGISH FLOOD INTO THE MORE ACTIVE SWIRL AND RUSH OF THE TWEED THE HOT OPPRESSIVE AIR OF THE NIGHT AND THE BLOOD ON THE DRY ROAD
FOR HE WENT ON AFTER AN INSTANT'S PAUSE AS IF HE HAD WAITED FOR SOMETHING IN VAIN AND HIS TONE WAS CHANGED ANNESLEY THOUGHT IT BY CONTRAST ALMOST BUSINESSLIKE YOU MUSTN'T BE AFRAID HE SAID THAT I MEAN TO STAY AT THE SAVOY MYSELF
HER SOUL PRESSING TO THE WINDOWS OF HER EYES WAS IT HE WHO HAD COME OR IT WAS HE BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO FINISH THE THOUGHT HE WALKED IN CONFIDENT AND SMILING AS WHEN SHE HAD LEFT HIM A FEW MINUTES
AND IT WAS WITH OPEN MOUTHED SURPRISE THAT THEY LISTENED TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL THEM PRESENTLY WE WERE ALL THREE ROUND THE DEAD MAN AND THIS TIME THERE WAS THE LIGHT OF THREE LAMPS ON HIS FACE AND ON THE GOUTS OF BLOOD THAT WERE ALL ABOUT HIM
THEN THEY WERE OFF THEY TWO ALONE TOGETHER AND ANNESLEY GUESSED THAT THE CHAUFFEUR MUST HAVE HAD HIS INSTRUCTIONS WHERE TO DRIVE AS SHE HEARD NONE GIVEN PERHAPS IT WAS BEST THAT THEIR DESTINATION SHOULD NOT BE PUBLISHED ALOUD FOR THERE ARE WALLS WHICH HAVE EARS
WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN INTRODUCTION A HARDNESS ABOUT THE HANDSOME FACE A FEW LINES ABOUT THE EYES AND MOUTH AND A FULLNESS OF THE CHIN SHOWED THAT SHE WAS OLDER FORTY PERHAPS
NOTHING AND NOBODY I SAID WELL SAID HE WE'LL HAVE TO GET HIM AWAY FROM THIS YOU'LL HAVE TO GET HELP HE WENT ON TURNING TO THE CONSTABLE FETCH SOME MEN TO HELP US CARRY HIM
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW I ASKED OF CHISHOLM WHO HAD FOLLOWED ME AND DO YOU WANT ME ANY MORE SERGEANT FOR IF NOT
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU SLIP OUT OF MY DREAM NOW I'VE GOT YOU IN IT
SHE FLASHED HIM A MEANING LOOK THOUGH WHAT THE MEANING WAS ANNESLEY COULD NOT GUESS SHE KNEW ONLY THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE THE COUNTESS AS SHE HAD WISHED TO LIKE HER LOVER'S FRIEND
CHAPTER SEVEN THE COUNTESS DE SANTIAGO YOU DON'T WISH TO TELL ME THE NAME RUTHVEN SMITH WAS SAYING THE REPETITION IRRITATED THE GIRL WHOSE NERVES WERE STRAINED TO SNAPPING POINT
THERE ARE EVEN REASONS WHY I'M PLEASED THAT YOU'VE MADE ME A PRESENT OF THE NAME I THANK YOU FOR IT AND FOR ALL THE REST OH BUT IF IT ISN'T REALLY YOUR NAME WE SHA'N'T BE LEGALLY MARRIED SHALL WE ANNESLEY PROTESTED
THAT THERE WAS MYSTERY IN THIS AFFAIR WAS SURER THAN EVER WHEN HAVING GOT THE MAN TO THE NEAREST INN AND BROUGHT MORE HELP INCLUDING A DOCTOR THEY BEGAN TO EXAMINE HIM AND HIS CLOTHING AND NOW
NOW MY PLAN IS TO ASK FOR HER SHE'LL BE IN BY THIS TIME HAVE A FEW WORDS OF EXPLANATION ON THE QUIET NOT TO EMBARRASS YOU AND THE COUNTESS WILL DO THE REST SHE'LL ENGAGE A ROOM FOR YOU NEXT TO HER OWN SUITE OR AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE
AYE AND HE'S BEEN DEAD A GOOD HOUR I SHOULD SAY BY THE FEEL OF HIM YOU HEARD NOTHING AS YOU CAME DOWN YON LANE MISTER HUGH NOT A SOUND I ANSWERED AND SAW NOTHING HE QUESTIONED
SHE WOULD HAVE FELT INSULTED YET SO IT WAS
BUT SHE SAT STILL IN HER CORNER OF THE TAXI AND GAVE HIM NO ANSWER LEST SHE SHOULD BETRAY HERSELF HER SILENCE AFTER THE WARMTH OF HIS WORDS SEEMED COLD PERHAPS HE FELT IT SO
I DARE SAY SHE'S OWING YOU SALARY I'LL REMIND HER OF IT IF YOU LIKE TELL HER YOU ASKED ME IT MAY HELP WITH THE TROUSSEAU THANK YOU BUT MY WIFE WON'T NEED TO REMIND MISSUS ELLSWORTH OF HER DEBT
I WAS GOOD BEFORE WHEN I WAS TEMPTED TO KISS YOU YOU'RE AT MY MERCY NOW IN A WAY ALL THE MORE BECAUSE I'M TAKING YOU FROM YOUR OLD EXISTENCE TO ONE YOU DON'T KNOW I SHA'N'T ASK TO KISS YOU EXCEPT MAYBE YOUR LITTLE HAND IF YOU DON'T MIND
WAS THIS THE MAN MISTER GILVERTHWAITE MEANT ME TO MEET WOULD MISTER GILVERTHWAITE HAVE BEEN MURDERED TOO IF HE HAD COME THERE IN PERSON AND HAD THE MAN BEEN MURDERED FOR THE SAKE OF ROBBERY
YOU SAW NOBODY ABOUT CLOSE BY NOR IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO STRANGERS ON THE ROAD I WAS READY FOR THAT QUESTION EVER SINCE FINDING THE BODY I HAD BEEN WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD SAY WHEN AUTHORITY
I HEAR FROM MISS GRAYLE THAT WE ARE NAMESAKES MISTER RUTHVEN SMITH SAID AS NELSON SMITH SPRANG IN AND TOOK THE GIRL'S BAG FROM HER ICE COLD HAND I HE ASKED ME I TOLD HIM
THE ANSWER CAME BEFORE ANNESLEY COULD SPEAK AND SHE WILL BE MY WIFE IN A DAY OR TWO AT LATEST GOOD NIGHT GLAD TO HAVE MET YOU
I TURNED OFF THE LIGHT SO I COULD LOOK OUT BY FLATTENING MY NOSE AGAINST THE GLASS I COULD SEE THAT THE PLACE WHERE THOSE CHAPS HAD WAITED WAS EMPTY BUT IN CASE THE TAXI WAS ONLY TURNING AND MEANT TO PASS THE HOUSE AGAIN I LIT THE ROOM ONCE MORE FOR REALISM
TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT HER HUGHIE WAS ALIVE AND SAFE WOULD HAVE TO LIE QUAKING AND SPECULATING THROUGH THE DARK HOURS OF THAT NIGHT
STILL ANNESLEY HOPED THAT HER LOVER HAD NOT ASKED THE LADY TO MOTHER HIS FIANCEE SHE HAD NOT THE AIR OF ONE WHO WOULD BE COMPLIMENTED BY SUCH A REQUEST AS ANNESLEY PUT HER HAND INTO THAT OF THE COUNTESS
BUT YOU'LL NOT MIND ME ASKING IT NOW WHAT WERE YOU DOING HERE YOURSELF AT THIS HOUR YOU'VE A GOOD RIGHT CHISHOLM SAID I AND I'LL TELL YOU FOR BY ALL I CAN SEE THERE'LL BE NO WAY OF KEEPING IT BACK
IT OCCURRED TO THE GIRL THAT PRECAUTIONS MIGHT STILL HAVE TO BE TAKEN BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS UNDECEIVED I THOUGHT OLD RUTHVEN SMITH WOULD BE SHOCKED IF HE KNEW THE SAFE REFUGE I HAVE FOR YOU
AND LINEN AND A TWEED SUIT OF THE SORT AFFECTED BY TOURISTS THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY IN HIS POCKETS BANK NOTES GOLD AND SILVER AND AN EXPENSIVE WATCH AND CHAIN AND OTHER SUCH THINGS THAT A GENTLEMAN WOULD CARRY
CHAPTER FOUR THE MURDERED MAN THERE MAY BE FOLK IN THE WORLD TO WHOM THE FINDING OF A DEAD MAN LYING GRIM AND STARK BY THE ROADSIDE WITH THE BLOOD FRESHLY RUN FROM IT
THAT I SAW HIM IN A STRONGER LIGHT I FOUND THAT HE WAS A STRONGLY BUILT WELL MADE MAN OF ABOUT MISTER GILVERTHWAITE'S AGE SAY JUST OVER SIXTY YEARS OR SO DRESSED IN A GENTLEMANLIKE FASHION AND WEARING GOOD BOOTS
I TELL YOU MEETING YOU AND WINNING YOU IN THIS WAY IS WORTH THE BEST TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE BUT YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION I'LL ANSWER IT NOW CRIED THE GIRL MEETING YOU IS WORTH ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE
NOW MISSUS ELLSWORTH IS ELIMINATED I'M NO LONGER A SECRET AND I EXPECT YOU'LL LIKE TO MEET MISTER RUTHVEN SMITH AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE A HOUSE TO ENTERTAIN HIM IN SO SPEAKING
HAD BEEN PROCLAIMED EMPEROR SOPHIA GOVERNING AS REGENT IN THEIR NAMES THE PRINCESS NOW MADE AN ARRANGEMENT FOR ESTABLISHING PETER IN A HOUSEHOLD OF HIS OWN AT A PALACE SITUATED IN A SMALL VILLAGE AT SOME DISTANCE FROM MOSCOW
AND THE NEXT INSTANT HE WAS CLOSE TO ME IN THE GLOOM AND LOOKING SHARPLY IN MY FACE ARE YOU SO SURE OF THAT NOW HE WHISPERED CUNNINGLY
AND TOOK THE OTHER IN MY HAND THIS I LIFTED OVER THE ROOF AND GENTLY SET IT DOWN ON THE SPACE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND COURT WHICH WAS EIGHT FEET WIDE I THEN STEPT OVER THE BUILDING VERY CONVENIENTLY FROM ONE STOOL TO THE OTHER
WITH THEIR CHIEF ATTENDANTS ABOUT THEM HER IMPERIAL MAJESTY WAS PLEASED TO SMILE VERY GRACIOUSLY UPON ME AND GAVE ME OUT OF THE WINDOW HER HAND TO KISS BUT I SHALL NOT ANTICIPATE THE READER WITH FURTHER DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS KIND
AND THE TIME ARRIVED FOR HIM TO LEAVE THE PLACE THE INSTITUTION HAD BECOME COMPLETELY ESTABLISHED
MAYBE YOUR MOTHER HUGH CAN FIND MISSUS HANSON A LODGING I ANSWERED THAT MY MOTHER WOULD NO DOUBT DO WHAT SHE COULD TO LOOK AFTER MISSUS HANSON AND PRESENTLY THE WOMAN WENT AWAY WITH MAISIE LEAVING HER PAPERS WITH MISTER LINDSEY
HE NEVER CAME NEAR ME SIR SHE SAID AND I NEVER HEARD WORD OF HIS BEING THERE FROM ANYBODY
THAT IS WITH ALL WHO BELONGED TO OR WERE CONNECTED WITH HIS MOTHER'S BRANCH OF THE FAMILY WITH THOSE WHO WERE CONNECTED WITH THE CHILDREN OF ALEXIS FIRST WIFE HE WAS AN OBJECT OF CONTINUAL JEALOUSY AND SUSPICION
HE EVEN CONTRIVED TO TURN THE HOURS OF PLAY AND THE COMPANIONS WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM AS MERE INSTRUMENTS OF PLEASURE INTO MEANS OF IMPROVEMENT
IT IS LIFTED UP PURE INTO THE AIR AND BORNE BY THE SERVANT WINDS BACK TO THE MOUNTAINTOPS AND THE SNOW THE SOLID ICE AND THE MOLTEN STREAM WELL WHEN THE HEART OF THE EARTH HAS THUS COME RUSHING UP AMONG HER CHILDREN
FOR WHERE THE LIGHT HAS NOTHING TO SHINE UPON MUCH THE SAME AS DARKNESS FROM THE HEAT FROM THE ENDLESS TUMULT OF BOILING UNREST UP WITH A SUDDEN HEAVENWARD SHOOT INTO THE WIND AND THE COLD AND THE STARSHINE
PURSUED FOR A LITTLE TIME AS LONG AS THE NOVELTY LASTED AND THEN THROWN ASIDE FOR SOMETHING MORE AMUSING PETER KNEW THAT WHEN HE BECAME A MAN HE WOULD BE EMPEROR OF ALL RUSSIA
MILDENDO THE METROPOLIS OF LILLIPUT DESCRIBED TOGETHER WITH THE EMPEROR'S PALACE A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND A PRINCIPAL SECRETARY CONCERNING THE AFFAIRS OF THAT EMPIRE THE AUTHOR'S OFFERS TO SERVE THE EMPEROR IN HIS WARS
THAT HE WAS CERTAINLY IN LIVERPOOL
AFTER GENERAL MENESIUS HAD BEEN DISMISSED SOPHIA ADOPTED AN ENTIRELY NEW SYSTEM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PETER BEFORE THIS TIME THEODORE HAD DIED AND PETER IN CONJUNCTION WITH JOHN
AS FAST AS HE HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS ADVANCED IN YEARS AND IN POWER OF APPRECIATING STUDIES MORE AND MORE ELEVATED THE RESULT WAS THAT WHEN AT LENGTH HE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
WAS SURROUNDED BY OTHER NATIONS THAT WOULD SOMETIMES UNLESS HE WAS WELL PREPARED FOR THEM ASSUME A HOSTILE ATTITUDE AGAINST HIS GOVERNMENT AND PERHAPS MAKE GREAT AGGRESSIONS UPON HIS TERRITORIES
MOST URGENT COUNSELS TO PERSEVERE AS HE HAD BEGUN IN THE FAITHFUL PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTY TO RESIST EVERY TEMPTATION TO IDLENESS OR EXCESS AND TO DEVOTE HIMSELF WHILE YOUNG WITH PATIENCE
UPON THE MOUNTAIN ON ONE OF ITS MANY CLAWS STOOD A GRAND OLD HOUSE HALF FARMHOUSE HALF CASTLE BELONGING TO THE KING AND THERE HIS ONLY CHILD
AND OF COURSE I WOULD LIKE TO PUT IN MY CLAIM TO WHAT HE'S LEFT IF HE'S LEFT IT TO NOBODY ELSE JUST SO AGREED MISTER LINDSEY AYE AND HOW LONG IS IT SINCE YOU LAST SAW YOUR BROTHER NOW
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEODORE'S IMBECILITY AS RELATED IN THE FIRST CHAPTER ONE OF THE FIRST SOURCES OF UNEASINESS FOR HER IN RESPECT TO THE CONTINUANCE OF HER POWER WAS THE PROBABILITY THAT PETER WOULD GROW UP TO BE A TALENTED
HE WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD THINGS AS THEY WERE EXCEPT FOR THE PRINCESS'S SAKE BUT WHOEVER IS DILIGENT WILL SOON BE CHEERFUL AND THOUGH THE MINERS MISSED THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE CASTLE THEY YET MANAGED TO GET ON WITHOUT THEM
AYE HE SAID PANAMA NOW HE WAS THERE AND THAT'S THE LAST YOU EVER HEARD THAT'S THE VERY LAST WE EVER HEARD SIR SHE ANSWERED TILL OF COURSE WE SAW THESE PIECES IN THE PAPERS THIS LAST DAY OR TWO
BEFORE I KNEW HOW IT CAME ABOUT CRONE WAS DEEP INTO THE MURDER BUSINESS THEY'LL NOT HAVE FOUND MUCH OUT BY THIS TIME YON POLICE FELLOWS NO DOUBT MISTER MONEYLAWS HE SAID
WAS WORTH TEN THOUSAND OFFERS TO DIE FOR HIS SAKE AND WOULD PROVE SO WHEN THE RIGHT TIME CAME AS FOR HIS FATHER AND MOTHER THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM UP WITHOUT A GRUMBLE FOR THEY WERE JUST AS GOOD AS THE KING
BUT OH HOW SWEET WAS THE AIR ON THE MOUNTAIN FACE WHEN THEY CAME OUT AT SUNSET TO GO HOME TO WIFE AND MOTHER THEY DID BREATHE DEEP THEN THE MINES BELONGED TO THE KING OF THE COUNTRY
MISTER LINDSEY AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER PANAMA THAT WAS THE PASSWORD WHICH JAMES GILVERTHWAITE HAD GIVEN ME SO HERE AT ANY RATE WAS SOMETHING HOWEVER LITTLE THAT HAD THE MAKINGS OF A CLUE IN IT
HE SAID TURNING TO MISSUS HANSON YOU CAN ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS NO DOUBT ABOUT YOUR BROTHER AND ABOUT MATTERS IN RELATION TO HIM FIRST OF ALL DO YOU KNOW IF ANY OF YOUR FOLKS HAILED FROM THIS PART
AND HE AND THEY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY BUT IN THIS MATTER NOT SEEING THAT HE COULD DO ANYTHING FOR THE KING WHICH ONE OF HIS NUMEROUS ATTENDANTS COULD NOT DO AS WELL CURDIE FELT THAT IT WAS FOR HIM TO DECIDE
EYEING ME INQUISITIVELY IN THE LIGHT OF THE ONE NAPHTHA LAMP THAT WAS SPURTING AND JUMPING IN HIS UNTIDY SHOP THEY'RE A SLOW UNORIGINAL LOT THE POLICE
THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE TWO BRANCHES OF THE FAMILY BECAME MORE DECIDED THAN EVER AND WHEN SOPHIA OBTAINED HER RELEASE FROM THE CONVENT AND MANAGED TO GET THE CONTROL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
THUS SHE THOUGHT THAT HIS PROGRESS IN STUDY WOULD BE EFFECTUALLY IMPEDED AND THAT PERHAPS HE WOULD UNDERMINE HIS HEALTH AND DESTROY HIS CONSTITUTION BY EATING AND DRINKING
WHAT FOR DID YOU NOT LET ON IN YOUR EVIDENCE
OF MY DESIGN TO VISIT THE TOWN THE WALL WHICH ENCOMPASSED IT IS TWO FEET AND A HALF HIGH AND AT LEAST ELEVEN INCHES BROAD SO THAT A COACH AND HORSES MAY BE DRIVEN VERY SAFELY ROUND IT AND IT IS FLANKED WITH STRONG TOWERS AT TEN FEET DISTANCE
I WALKED WITH THE UTMOST CIRCUMSPECTION TO AVOID TREADING ON ANY STRAGGLERS WHO MIGHT REMAIN IN THE STREETS ALTHOUGH THE ORDERS WERE VERY STRICT THAT ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KEEP IN THEIR HOUSES AT THEIR OWN PERIL
UNTIL IT SPRINGS NEWBORN TO THE LIGHT AND RUSHES DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE IN TORRENTS AND DOWN THE VALLEYS IN RIVERS DOWN DOWN REJOICING TO THE MIGHTY LUNGS OF THE WORLD THAT IS THE SEA
THAT COMES WANDERING ABOUT THE HOUSE AT NIGHT AND EVERLASTING STILLNESS EXCEPT FOR THE WIND THAT TURNS THE ROCKS AND CAVERNS INTO A ROARING ORGAN FOR THE YOUNG ARCHANGELS THAT ARE STUDYING HOW TO LET OUT THE PENT UP PRAISES OF THEIR HEARTS
AND IT CONTINUED IN SUCCESSFUL OPERATION AS SUCH FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
AND WHOEVER CAN'T TELL IS FREE TO THINK ALL WAITING TO FLASH WAITING FOR MILLIONS OF AGES EVER SINCE THE EARTH FLEW OFF FROM THE SUN A GREAT BLOT OF FIRE AND BEGAN TO COOL
AND I'VE NEVER SET EYES ON HIM FROM THAT DAY TO THIS BUT I SHOULD KNOW HIM NOW HE WAS BURIED YESTERDAY REMARKED MISTER LINDSEY IT'S A PITY YOU DIDN'T TELEGRAPH TO SOME OF US
LIKE THE RICH EMBROIDERY OF THE GARMENT BELOW
AND DREW UP THE FIRST AFTER ME WITH A HOOKED STICK
AND TO IMPROVE AND PERFECT THE ORGANIZATION OF IT IN EVERY WAY AFTER A WHILE HE ADOPTED IMPROVED UNIFORMS AND EQUIPMENTS FOR THE PUPILS
AS FOR HIS VERSES THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO MAKE ANY NOW HE HAD MADE THEM ONLY TO DRIVE AWAY THE GOBLINS AND THEY WERE ALL GONE A GOOD RIDDANCE ONLY THE PRINCESS WAS GONE TOO
EACH SIDE OF THE WALL BEING FIVE HUNDRED FEET LONG THE TWO GREAT STREETS WHICH RUN ACROSS AND DIVIDE IT INTO FOUR QUARTERS ARE FIVE FEET WIDE THE LANES AND ALLEYS WHICH I COULD NOT ENTER BUT ONLY VIEW THEM AS I PASSED
IF HE KNEW IN DETAIL PRECISELY HOW EVERY THING OUGHT TO BE DONE AND THAT WAS THE REASON WHY HE TOOK SO MUCH PAINS TO LEARN HIMSELF HOW TO DO THEM AS HE GREW OLDER HE CONTRIVED TO INTRODUCE HIGHER AND HIGHER BRANCHES OF MILITARY ART INTO THE SCHOOL
AND ALLOW HIM TO DO AS HE PLEASED HER PLAN WAS ALSO TO SUPPLY HIM WITH MEANS OF PLEASURE AND INDULGENCE VERY FREELY THINKING THAT A BOY OF HIS AGE WOULD NOT HAVE THE GOOD SENSE OR THE RESOLUTION TO RESIST THESE TEMPTATIONS
WHO FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND IN VARIOUS WAYS MADE THEMSELVES TROUBLESOME TO ALL BUT TO THE LITTLE PRINCESS DANGEROUS MAINLY BY THE WATCHFUL DEVOTION AND ENERGY OF CURDIE HOWEVER
WHERE THE TWO GREAT STREETS MEET IT IS ENCLOSED BY A WALL OF TWO FEET HIGH AND TWENTY FEET DISTANCE FROM THE BUILDINGS I HAD HIS MAJESTY'S PERMISSION TO STEP OVER THIS WALL AND THE SPACE BEING SO WIDE BETWEEN THAT AND THE PALACE
AND THE TREES GROWING OUT OF ITS SIDES LIKE HAIR TO CLOTHE IT AND THE LOVELY GRASS IN THE VALLEYS AND THE GRACIOUS FLOWERS
COME YOU COULD HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER AS THE SAYING IS WHEN HE SAID THAT AND BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FROM THE SURPRISE OF IT HE HAD A HAND ON MY ARM
HOW BEAUTIFUL HE LOOKED THEY SAID WHEN HE RODE THE KING'S OWN HORSE THROUGH THE RIVER THAT THE GOBLINS HAD SENT OUT OF THE HILL HE MIGHT SOON HAVE BEEN A CAPTAIN THEY DID BELIEVE THE GOOD KIND PEOPLE DID NOT REFLECT
AND LEARNED WITH THEM ALL THE EVOLUTIONS AND PRACTICED ALL THE DISCIPLINE NECESSARY IN A CAMP
GENERAL MENESIUS RESIDED IN THE PALACE WITH HIS CHARGE
BECAUSE I RESERVE THEM FOR A GREATER WORK WHICH IS NOW ALMOST READY FOR THE PRESS CONTAINING A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THIS EMPIRE FROM ITS FIRST ERECTION THROUGH ALONG SERIES OF PRINCES WITH A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THEIR WARS AND POLITICS
THAT SO THEY MIGHT LEARN IT THEMSELVES AND COME TO DO WITHOUT JUDGES AT ALL NOTHING THAT COULD BE GOT FROM THE HEART OF THE EARTH COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO BETTER PURPOSES THAN THE SILVER THE KING'S MINERS GOT FOR HIM
HE TURNED TO ME WHEN WE WERE ALONE SOME FOLKS WOULD THINK THAT WAS A BIT OF HELP TO ME IN SOLVING THE MYSTERY HUGH SAID HE BUT HANG ME IF I DON'T THINK IT MAKES THE WHOLE THING MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN EVER
IN OLD TIMES WITHOUT KNOWING SO MUCH OF THEIR STRANGENESS AND AWFULNESS AS WE DO PEOPLE WERE YET MORE AFRAID OF MOUNTAINS BUT THEN SOMEHOW THEY HAD NOT COME TO SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE AS WELL AS AWFUL AND THEY HATED THEM
THEIR DESIGNS HAD BEEN UTTERLY DEFEATED AND MADE TO RECOIL UPON THEMSELVES TO THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION SO THAT NOW THERE WERE VERY FEW OF THEM LEFT ALIVE AND THE MINERS DID NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A SINGLE GOBLIN REMAINING IN THE WHOLE INSIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
AND THE FRIGHTFUL GULFS OF BLUE AIR CRACKED IN THE GLACIERS AND THE DARK PROFOUND LAKES COVERED LIKE LITTLE ARCTIC OCEANS WITH FLOATING LUMPS OF ICE ALL THIS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAIN
DO YOU KNOW AUGHT OF THAT MAN JOHN PHILLIPS WHOSE NAME'S IN THE PAPERS TOO HE ASKED NO SIR NOTHING SHE REPLIED PROMPTLY NEVER HEARD TELL OF HIM
HAVE FALLEN INTO THE SNARE SO ADROITLY LAID FOR THEM AND BEEN RUINED BUT PETER ESCAPED IT WHETHER IT WAS FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE COUNSELS AND INSTRUCTIONS OF HIS FORMER GOVERNOR OR FROM HIS OWN NATIVE GOOD SENSE
AND HE WANTED THE SILVER NOT TO BUY RICH THINGS FOR HIMSELF BUT TO HELP HIM TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY AND PAY THE ONES THAT DEFENDED IT FROM CERTAIN TROUBLESOME NEIGHBOURS AND THE JUDGES WHOM HE SET TO PORTION OUT RIGHTEOUSNESS AMONG THE PEOPLE
THE LAWYER I WENT TO SIR SAID GO YOURSELF REPLIED MISSUS HANSON SO I SET OFF FIRST THING THIS MORNING LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE PAPERS SAID MISTER LINDSEY
WHICH I SPENT IN CUTTING DOWN WITH MY KNIFE SOME OF THE LARGEST TREES IN THE ROYAL PARK ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT FROM THE CITY OF THESE TREES I MADE TWO STOOLS EACH ABOUT THREE FEET HIGH
SAID MISSUS HANSON HE WAS A GREAT MASTERFUL STRONG LAD AND HE'D RUN OFF TO SEA BY THE TIME HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD
AFTER THE MURDER OF JOHN PHILLIPS AND IT WAS JUST THE EIGHTH NIGHT AFTER MY FINDING OF THE BODY THAT I GOT INTO THE HANDS OF ABEL CRONE ABEL CRONE WAS A MAN THAT HAD COME TO BERWICK ABOUT THREE YEARS BEFORE THIS
AND LYING DOWN UPON MY SIDE I APPLIED MY FACE TO THE WINDOWS OF THE MIDDLE STORIES WHICH WERE LEFT OPEN ON PURPOSE AND DISCOVERED THE MOST SPLENDID APARTMENTS THAT CAN BE IMAGINED THERE I SAW THE EMPRESS AND THE YOUNG PRINCES IN THEIR SEVERAL LODGINGS
SO YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE THE SISTER OF THIS MAN JAMES GILVERTHWAITE MA'AM BEGAN MISTER LINDSEY MOTIONING THE VISITOR TO SIT DOWN AND BECKONING MAISIE TO STOP WITH US WHAT MIGHT YOUR NAME BE NOW
AND WHAT PEOPLE HATE THEY MUST FEAR NOW THAT WE HAVE LEARNED TO LOOK AT THEM WITH ADMIRATION PERHAPS WE DO NOT FEEL QUITE AWE ENOUGH OF THEM
AND THE MOLTEN MUSIC OF THE STREAMS RUSHING EVER FROM THE BOSOMS OF THE GLACIERS FRESH BORN THINK TOO OF THE CHANGE IN THEIR OWN SUBSTANCE
THE KING HAD BEEN SO PLEASED WITH THE BOY THEN APPROACHING THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE THAT WHEN HE CARRIED AWAY HIS DAUGHTER HE ASKED HIM TO ACCOMPANY THEM
OR THE LIKE OF THAT SOMETHING MORE THAN BY ORDINARY YOU'LL UNDERSTAND ME TO MEAN MISTER MONEYLAWS
THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO WHEN IT CAME INTO THEIR HANDS DEGRADED IT BY LOCKING IT UP IN A CHEST AND THEN IT GREW DISEASED AND WAS CALLED MAMMON AND BRED ALL SORTS OF QUARRELS
TILL SHE WAS NEARLY NINE YEARS OLD AND WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE CONTINUED MUCH LONGER BUT FOR THE STRANGE EVENTS TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED AT THAT TIME THE HOLLOW PLACES OF THE MOUNTAIN WERE INHABITED BY CREATURES CALLED GOBLINS
WHOSE RUSTY BLACK CLOTHES MADE HER LOOK THINNER AND MORE MEAGRE THAN SHE REALLY WAS ALL THE SAME
AND STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR MY WEIGHT THE PEOPLE HAVING RECEIVED NOTICE A SECOND TIME I WENT AGAIN THROUGH THE CITY TO THE PALACE WITH MY TWO STOOLS IN MY HANDS WHEN I CAME TO THE SIDE OF THE OUTER COURT I STOOD UPON ONE STOOL
THAT THE ROAD TO THE NEXT DUTY IS THE ONLY STRAIGHT ONE OR THAT FOR THEIR FANCIED GOOD WE SHOULD NEVER WISH OUR CHILDREN OR FRIENDS TO DO WHAT WE WOULD NOT DO OURSELVES IF WE WERE IN THEIR POSITION
I ANSWERED WHERE SIR PANAMA HE EXCLAIMED WITH A JERK OF HIS HEAD PANAMA JUST THAT IT BEGAN A LONG WAY OFF PANAMA AS FAR AS I SEE IT AND WHAT DID BEGIN AND WHAT WAS GOING ON
FROM ONE SQUARE INTO ANOTHER WERE BUT EIGHTEEN INCHES HIGH AND SEVEN INCHES WIDE NOW THE BUILDINGS OF THE OUTER COURT WERE AT LEAST FIVE FEET HIGH AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO STRIDE OVER THEM WITHOUT INFINITE DAMAGE TO THE PILE
THEN THERE ARE CAVERNS FULL OF WATER NUMBINGLY COLD FIERCELY HOT HOTTER THAN ANY BOILING WATER FROM SOME OF THESE THE WATER CANNOT GET OUT AND FROM OTHERS IT RUNS IN CHANNELS AS THE BLOOD IN THE BODY
LITTLE VEINS BRING IT DOWN FROM THE ICE ABOVE INTO THE GREAT CAVERNS OF THE MOUNTAIN'S HEART WHENCE THE ARTERIES LET IT OUT AGAIN GUSHING IN PIPES AND CLEFTS AND DUCTS OF ALL SHAPES AND KINDS THROUGH AND THROUGH ITS BULK
PERSEVERANCE AND INDUSTRY TO THE WORK OF STORING HIS MIND WITH USEFUL KNOWLEDGE AND OF ACQUIRING EVERY POSSIBLE ART AND ACCOMPLISHMENT WHICH COULD BE OF ADVANTAGE TO HIM WHEN HE BECAME A MAN
ELSE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO COME ALL THIS WAY MY NAME'S HANSON MISSUS HANSON I COME FROM GARSTON NEAR LIVERPOOL AYE JUST SO A LANCASHIRE WOMAN SAID MISTER LINDSEY NODDING
LAWS LEARNING AND RELIGION THEIR PLANTS AND ANIMALS THEIR PECULIAR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS WITH OTHER MATTERS VERY CURIOUS AND USEFUL MY CHIEF DESIGN AT PRESENT BEING ONLY TO RELATE SUCH EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS AS HAPPENED TO THE PUBLIC
AND TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT BECOME ME WHO WAS A FOREIGNER TO INTERFERE WITH PARTIES BUT I WAS READY WITH THE HAZARD OF MY LIFE
CHAPTER NINE THE MARINE STORE DEALER
AND I WAS HELPING HIM TO BUILD HUTCHES FOR THE BEASTS IN HIS FATHER'S BACK YARD AND WE WERE WANTING SOME BITS OF STUFF IRON AND WIRE AND THE LIKE AND KNOWING I WOULD PICK IT UP FOR A FEW PENCE AT CRONE'S SHOP I WENT ROUND THERE ALONE
THOUGH THE WALLS WERE STRONGLY BUILT OF HEWN STONE AND FOUR INCHES THICK AT THE SAME TIME THE EMPEROR HAD A GREAT DESIRE THAT I SHOULD SEE THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS PALACE BUT THIS I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO TILL THREE DAYS AFTER
THE WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD AS IF THIS QUESTION PRESENTED DIFFICULTIES
I STEPPED OVER THE GREAT WESTERN GATE AND PASSED VERY GENTLY AND SIDLING THROUGH THE TWO PRINCIPAL STREETS ONLY IN MY SHORT WAISTCOAT FOR FEAR OF DAMAGING THE ROOFS AND EAVES OF THE HOUSES WITH THE SKIRTS OF MY COAT
AND TO HAVE ANOTHER ARRANGEMENT MADE FOR THE BOY BY WHICH SHE THOUGHT HER ENDS WOULD BE ATTAINED SO MENESIUS BADE HIS YOUNG CHARGE FAREWELL NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT GIVING HIM IN PARTING
HEAVED UP IN BILLOWS TWISTED IN WATERSPOUTS DASHED TO MIST UPON ROCKS BEATEN BY MILLIONS OF TAILS AND BREATHED BY MILLIONS OF GILLS WHENCE AT LAST MELTED INTO VAPOUR BY THE SUN
FOR SAID HE AS FLOURISHING A CONDITION AS WE MAY APPEAR TO BE IN TO FOREIGNERS WE LABOUR UNDER TWO MIGHTY EVILS A VIOLENT FACTION AT HOME AND THE DANGER OF AN INVASION
ONE MORNING ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTER I HAD OBTAINED MY LIBERTY RELDRESAL PRINCIPAL SECRETARY AS THEY STYLE HIM FOR PRIVATE AFFAIRS CAME TO MY HOUSE ATTENDED ONLY BY ONE SERVANT
RUNNING CEASELESSLY COLD AND BABBLING THROUGH BANKS CRUSTED WITH CARBUNCLES AND GOLDEN TOPAZES OR OVER A GRAVEL OF WHICH SOME OF THE STONES ARC RUBIES AND EMERALDS PERHAPS DIAMONDS AND SAPPHIRES WHO CAN TELL
NOW THINK OUT OF THAT CAULDRON WHERE ALL THE BUBBLES WOULD BE AS BIG AS THE ALPS IF IT COULD GET ROOM FOR ITS BOILING CERTAIN BUBBLES HAVE BUBBLED OUT AND ESCAPED UP AND AWAY
WHICH WENT TO PROVE THAT THIS MAN HAD BEEN BORN IN LIVERPOOL ABOUT SIXTY TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY THAT AS MISTER LINDSEY WAS QUICK TO POINT OUT FITTED IN WITH WHAT GILVERTHWAITE HAD TOLD MY MOTHER AND MYSELF ABOUT HIS AGE WELL
BUT WHEN FIRST IT LEFT THE KING'S HANDS IT NEVER MADE ANY BUT FRIENDS AND THE AIR OF THE WORLD KEPT IT CLEAN ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE THIS STORY BEGAN A SERIES OF VERY REMARKABLE EVENTS HAD JUST ENDED
OR BY OTHER HURTFUL INDULGENCES BUT SOPHIA FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT INDUCE GENERAL MENESIUS TO CO OPERATE WITH HER IN ANY SUCH PLANS HE HAD SET HIS HEART ON MAKING HIS PUPIL
OBEYING THE COMMANDS WHICH WERE GIVEN TO HIM WHEN IT CAME TO HIS TURN TO SERVE AND TAKING HIS FULL SHARE OF ALL THE HARDEST OF THE WORK WHICH WAS TO BE DONE NOR WAS THIS ALL MERE BOYS PLAY
THAT SO MANY OF THE LEADING NOBLES ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO HIS CAUSE
THERE WAS A MAN A NEIGHBOUR OF OURS CAME HOME FROM CENTRAL AMERICA MAYBE FIVE YEARS AGO AND HE TOLD US HE'D SEEN OUR JAMES OUT THERE AND THAT HE WAS WORKING AS A SUB CONTRACTOR OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT ON THAT PANAMA CANAL THERE WAS SO MUCH TALK ABOUT IN THEM DAYS
FOR HER SPEECH WAS LIKE HIS
WHAT'S WANTED IN AN AFFAIR LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GENIUSES YOU READ ABOUT IN THE STORYBOOKS THE MEN THAT CAN TRACE A MURDER FROM THE WAY A MAN TURNS OUT HIS TOES
IT WAS JUST AFTER I WAS MARRIED TO HANSON AND THAT WAS WHEN I WAS ABOUT THREE AND TWENTY AND I WAS FIFTY SIX LAST BIRTHDAY JAMES CAME ONCE TO SEE ME AND HANSON SOON AFTER WE WAS SETTLED DOWN
AND THERE THEY STAND IN THE COOL COLD SKY MOUNTAINS THINK OF THE CHANGE AND YOU WILL NO MORE WONDER THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING AWFUL ABOUT THE VERY LOOK OF A MOUNTAIN FROM THE DARKNESS
BUT OF GLOWING HOT MELTED METALS AND STONES AND AS OUR HEARTS KEEP US ALIVE SO THAT GREAT LUMP OF HEAT KEEPS THE EARTH ALIVE IT IS A HUGE POWER OF BURIED SUNLIGHT THAT IS WHAT IT IS
BUT HOWEVER THIS BE
SHE ANSWERED AND TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF SIR
SAID HE MIGHT PRETEND TO SOME MERIT IN IT BUT HOWEVER ADDED THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THINGS AT COURT
DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR BROTHER EVER CAME TO BERWICK AS A LAD ASKED MISTER LINDSEY WITH A GLANCE AT ME
AND AT LAST THE WOMAN PUT THE QUESTION WHICH IT WAS EVIDENT SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO HAVE ANSWERED DEFINITELY
YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF FOLLOWING ANYTHING UP YOURSELF MISTER MONEYLAWS I SUPPOSE ME I EXCLAIMED WHAT SHOULD I BE FOLLOWING UP MAN I KNOW NO MORE THAN THE MERE SURFACE FACTS OF THE AFFAIR
ARE TUNNELLED AND BORED IN THE DARKNESS OF THEIR BOSOMS BY THE DWELLERS IN THE HOUSES WHICH THEY HOLD UP TO THE SUN AND AIR CURDIE AND HIS FATHER WERE OF THESE THEIR BUSINESS WAS TO BRING TO LIGHT HIDDEN THINGS
ARE FROM TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN INCHES THE TOWN IS CAPABLE OF HOLDING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS THE HOUSES ARE FROM THREE TO FIVE STORIES THE SHOPS AND MARKETS WELL PROVIDED THE EMPEROR'S PALACE IS IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY
BRINGING WITH IT GIFTS OF ALL THAT SHE POSSESSES THEN STRAIGHTWAY INTO IT RUSH HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN FIND THERE WITH PICKAXE AND SPADE AND CROWBAR WITH BORING CHISEL AND BLASTING POWDER
YOU SAY YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HIM FOR THIRTY YEARS OR MORE BUT HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF HIM SHE NODDED HER HEAD WITH DECISION AT THAT QUESTION YES SHE REPLIED I HAVE HEARD OF HIM JUST ONCE
PETER AND HIS WIFE HOWEVER WERE TROUBLED WITH THE FANCY THAT THEY HAD STOOD IN THE WAY OF THEIR BOY'S GOOD FORTUNE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A FINE THING FOR HIM AND THEM TOO THEY THOUGHT IF HE HAD RIDDEN WITH THE GOOD KING'S TRAIN
AND DESIRED I WOULD GIVE HIM AN HOURS AUDIENCE WHICH I READILY CONSENTED TO
I SHALL BE SO GLAD WHEN I CAN GO TO SCHOOL FOR I'VE HEARD SUCH EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THE NEW TEACHER THE GIRLS ALL THINK SHE IS PERFECTLY SWEET DIANA SAYS SHE HAS THE LOVELIEST FAIR CURLY HAIR AND SUCH FASCINATING EYES SHE DRESSES BEAUTIFULLY AND HER SLEEVE PUFFS ARE BIGGER THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S IN AVONLEA
SO HE MEANS TO EARN HIS OWN WAY THROUGH I EXPECT HE'LL GET THE SCHOOL HERE IF MISS AMES DECIDES TO LEAVE ANNE FELT A QUEER LITTLE SENSATION OF DISMAYED SURPRISE SHE HAD NOT KNOWN THIS
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE THOSE POINTED FIRS COMING OUT AGAINST THE PINK SKY AND THAT WHITE ORCHARD AND THE OLD SNOW QUEEN ISN'T THE BREATH OF THE MINT DELICIOUS AND THAT TEA ROSE
BUT STILL I LIKE HIM AND I'M AWFULLY SORRY I EVER CRITICIZED HIS PRAYERS I BELIEVE NOW HE REALLY DOES MEAN THEM ONLY HE HAS GOT INTO THE HABIT OF SAYING THEM AS IF HE DIDN'T HE COULD GET OVER THAT IF HE'D TAKE A LITTLE TROUBLE I GAVE HIM A GOOD BROAD HINT
A LITTLE TIRED OF ALL THEIR GAMES AND RIPE FOR ANY ENTICING FORM OF MISCHIEF WHICH MIGHT PRESENT ITSELF THIS PRESENTLY TOOK THE FORM OF DARING DARING WAS THE FASHIONABLE AMUSEMENT AMONG THE AVONLEA SMALL FRY JUST THEN IT HAD BEGUN AMONG THE BOYS BUT SOON SPREAD TO THE GIRLS
OH I THINK SOME PARTS OF IT ARE FINE CONCEDED DAVY THAT STORY ABOUT JOSEPH NOW IT'S BULLY BUT IF I'D BEEN JOSEPH
IT WILL HELP ME THROUGH SPLENDIDLY I EXPECT WHAT DO PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T ANY IMAGINATION DO WHEN THEY BREAK THEIR BONES DO YOU SUPPOSE MARILLA ANNE HAD GOOD REASON TO BLESS HER IMAGINATION MANY A TIME AND OFT DURING THE TEDIOUS SEVEN WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED BUT SHE WAS NOT SOLELY DEPENDENT ON IT
YOU MUST TAKE A REST NOW THAT I'M HOME I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE THIS ONE DAY OFF TO VISIT ALL THE DEAR OLD SPOTS AND HUNT UP MY OLD DREAMS AND THEN IT WILL BE YOUR TURN TO BE LAZY WHILE I DO THE WORK MARILLA SMILED AFFECTIONATELY AT HER GIRL IT'S NOT THE WORK IT'S MY HEAD
SHE WON'T BE NEW ANY MORE BY THE TIME I'M ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND GIL EVERYBODY WILL GET AHEAD OF ME IN CLASS OH I AM AN AFFLICTED MORTAL
FOR WE PAY A PRICE FOR EVERYTHING WE GET OR TAKE IN THIS WORLD AND ALTHOUGH AMBITIONS ARE WELL WORTH HAVING THEY ARE NOT TO BE CHEAPLY WON BUT EXACT THEIR DUES OF WORK AND SELF DENIAL ANXIETY AND DISCOURAGEMENT ANNE WAS PALE AND QUIET
EVERY OTHER FRIDAY AFTERNOON SHE HAS RECITATIONS
A WEEK AFTER THE TEA AT THE MANSE DIANA BARRY GAVE A PARTY SMALL AND SELECT ANNE ASSURED MARILLA JUST THE GIRLS IN OUR CLASS THEY HAD A VERY GOOD TIME AND NOTHING UNTOWARD HAPPENED UNTIL AFTER TEA WHEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE BARRY GARDEN
I HAVEN'T THE MORAL COURAGE I'M GOING STRAIGHT TO THE GIRLS DRESSING ROOM YOU MUST READ THE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND THEN COME AND TELL ME JANE AND I IMPLORE YOU IN THE NAME OF OUR OLD FRIENDSHIP TO DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
SHE'S THE WOMAN YOU AND DIANA LIT ON WHEN YOU JUMPED INTO THE SPARE ROOM BED AIN'T SHE DIANA TOLD ME THAT STORY IS THAT WHY SHE LEFT YOU SO MUCH
OH IT'S JUST GLORIOUS TO THINK OF IT JOSIE PYE SAYS SHE HATES IT BUT THAT IS JUST BECAUSE JOSIE HAS SO LITTLE IMAGINATION DIANA AND RUBY GILLIS AND JANE ANDREWS ARE PREPARING A DIALOGUE CALLED A MORNING VISIT FOR NEXT FRIDAY
AND WADED UP TO GREEN GABLES EVERY POSSIBLE EVENING BUT GILBERT'S VISITS WERE NOT WHAT THEY ONCE WERE ANNE ALMOST DREADED THEM IT WAS VERY DISCONCERTING TO LOOK UP IN THE MIDST OF A SUDDEN SILENCE AND FIND GILBERT'S HAZEL EYES FIXED UPON HER
WELL ANNE YOU'VE DONE REAL WELL AT QUEEN'S I MUST SAY TO TAKE FIRST CLASS LICENSE IN ONE YEAR AND WIN THE AVERY SCHOLARSHIP
ALL THE FIFTH CLASS GIRLS SAID OH PARTLY IN EXCITEMENT PARTLY IN DISMAY DON'T YOU DO IT ANNE ENTREATED DIANA YOU'LL FALL OFF AND BE KILLED NEVER MIND JOSIE PYE IT ISN'T FAIR TO DARE ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING SO DANGEROUS I MUST DO IT
AND YELLING AT THE TOPS OF THEIR VOICES HURRAH FOR BLYTHE MEDALIST FOR A MOMENT ANNE FELT ONE SICKENING PANG OF DEFEAT AND DISAPPOINTMENT SO SHE HAD FAILED AND GILBERT HAD WON
FOR THE OLD WAY THROUGH THE HAUNTED WOOD WAS IMPASSABLE WITH DRIFTS AND THE LONG WAY OVER THE FROZEN LAKE OF SHINING WATERS WAS ALMOST AS BAD RUBY GILLIS WAS SLEEPING IN THE WHITE HEAPED GRAVEYARD JANE ANDREWS WAS TEACHING A SCHOOL ON WESTERN PRAIRIES GILBERT TO BE SURE WAS STILL FAITHFUL
MATTHEW HASTILY SUMMONED FROM THE HARVEST FIELD WAS STRAIGHTWAY DISPATCHED FOR THE DOCTOR WHO IN DUE TIME CAME TO DISCOVER THAT THE INJURY WAS MORE SERIOUS THAN THEY HAD SUPPOSED ANNE'S ANKLE WAS BROKEN
I AM SHE SAID ANNE WENT HOME TO AVONLEA WITH MATTHEW AND MARILLA THAT EVENING SHE HAD NOT BEEN HOME SINCE APRIL AND SHE FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT WAIT ANOTHER DAY THE APPLE BLOSSOMS WERE OUT AND THE WORLD WAS FRESH AND YOUNG
ANNE TOSSED HER RED BRAIDS I DON'T THINK IT'S SUCH A VERY WONDERFUL THING TO WALK A LITTLE LOW BOARD FENCE SHE SAID I KNEW A GIRL IN MARYSVILLE WHO COULD WALK THE RIDGEPOLE OF A ROOF I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID JOSIE FLATLY I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY COULD WALK A RIDGEPOLE
AND THE BARRYS HAVE BEEN EXPECTING TO HEAR OF HER DEATH ANY TIME IT IS WELL SHE IS AT REST
MY HONOR IS AT STAKE SAID ANNE SOLEMNLY I SHALL WALK THAT RIDGEPOLE DIANA OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT IF I AM KILLED YOU ARE TO HAVE MY PEARL BEAD RING ANNE CLIMBED THE LADDER AMID BREATHLESS SILENCE GAINED THE RIDGEPOLE
AND SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF WOMEN AT ALL SHE SAYS IT UNFITS THEM FOR WOMAN'S TRUE SPHERE I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT SPEAKING OF RACHEL REMINDS ME DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THE ABBEY BANK LATELY ANNE I HEARD IT WAS SHAKY ANSWERED ANNE WHY
AND EVEN ON FINE DAYS IT DRIFTED UNCEASINGLY NO SOONER WERE THE ROADS BROKEN THAN THEY FILLED IN AGAIN IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STIR OUT THE A V I S TRIED ON THREE EVENINGS TO HAVE A PARTY IN HONOR OF THE COLLEGE STUDENTS
ANNE HAD LEFT A THIN TYPEWRITTEN COMMUNICATION TILL THE LAST THINKING IT UNIMPORTANT
SURELY HE WAS MUCH GRAYER THAN HE HAD BEEN A YEAR BEFORE MARILLA SHE SAID HESITATINGLY WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT IS MATTHEW QUITE WELL NO HE ISN'T SAID MARILLA IN A TROUBLED TONE HE'S HAD SOME REAL BAD SPELLS WITH HIS HEART THIS SPRING
IN TEN MORE MINUTES SHE WOULD KNOW WHO HAD WON THE MEDAL AND WHO THE AVERY BEYOND THOSE TEN MINUTES THERE DID NOT SEEM JUST THEN TO BE ANYTHING WORTH BEING CALLED TIME OF COURSE YOU'LL WIN ONE OF THEM ANYHOW SAID JANE
WHEN ANNE HAD FINISHED HER ESSAY IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN GLAD RETORTED MARILLA YOU DO LIKE TO RUB THINGS IN MATTHEW CUTHBERT MISS BARRY WHO WAS SITTING BEHIND THEM LEANED FORWARD AND POKED MARILLA IN THE BACK WITH HER PARASOL AREN'T YOU PROUD OF THAT ANNE GIRL
I'VE GOT A PAIN SO OFTEN NOW BEHIND MY EYES DOCTOR SPENCER'S BEEN FUSSING WITH GLASSES BUT THEY DON'T DO ME ANY GOOD THERE IS A DISTINGUISHED OCULIST COMING TO THE ISLAND THE LAST OF JUNE AND THE DOCTOR SAYS I MUST SEE HIM I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO I CAN'T READ OR SEW WITH ANY COMFORT NOW
A PLAINTIVE VOICE GREETED HER FROM THE BED AREN'T YOU VERY SORRY FOR ME MARILLA IT WAS YOUR OWN FAULT SAID MARILLA TWITCHING DOWN THE BLIND AND LIGHTING A LAMP AND THAT IS JUST WHY YOU SHOULD BE SORRY FOR ME SAID ANNE
AWFUL OLD GOSSIP COMPLETED DAVY CALMLY THAT'S WHAT EVERY ONE CALLS HER BUT IS IT A SURE THING ANNE I WANT TO KNOW YOU'RE A VERY SILLY LITTLE BOY DAVY SAID ANNE STALKING HAUGHTILY OUT OF THE ROOM THE KITCHEN WAS DESERTED
OR A VOLCANIC EXPLOSION WHICH BLEW HIM HIGH AND DRY OUT OF HIS TROUBLES LANDED HIM IN A FORTUNE
WHEN THEY WENT UP THE ENTRANCE STEPS OF QUEEN'S
TERRIFIED SHRIEK IF ANNE HAD TUMBLED OFF THE ROOF ON THE SIDE UP WHICH SHE HAD ASCENDED
BUT I THINK I AM RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS WHERE SOBBED CARRIE SLOANE OH WHERE ANNE BEFORE ANNE COULD ANSWER MISSUS BARRY APPEARED ON THE SCENE AT SIGHT OF HER ANNE TRIED TO SCRAMBLE TO HER FEET BUT SANK BACK AGAIN WITH A SHARP LITTLE CRY OF PAIN
THAN ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE WHO HAS NEVER TRIED IT BUT JOSIE PYE IF DEFICIENT IN SOME QUALITIES THAT MAKE FOR POPULARITY HAD AT LEAST A NATURAL AND INBORN GIFT DULY CULTIVATED FOR WALKING BOARD FENCES JOSIE WALKED THE BARRY FENCE WITH AN AIRY UNCONCERN WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY
HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE TIME HE BROKE HIS ANKLE WHEN HE WAS A BOY IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF SUPERINTENDENT BELL EVER BEING A BOY EVEN MY IMAGINATION HAS ITS LIMITS FOR I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WHEN I TRY TO IMAGINE HIM AS A BOY I SEE HIM WITH GRAY WHISKERS AND SPECTACLES
WITH A QUITE UNMISTAKABLE EXPRESSION IN THEIR GRAVE DEPTHS AND IT WAS STILL MORE DISCONCERTING TO FIND HERSELF BLUSHING HOTLY AND UNCOMFORTABLY UNDER HIS GAZE JUST AS IF JUST AS IF WELL IT WAS VERY EMBARRASSING
AT THAT MOMENT MARILLA HAD A REVELATION IN THE SUDDEN STAB OF FEAR THAT PIERCED HER VERY HEART SHE REALIZED WHAT ANNE HAD COME TO MEAN TO HER SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT SHE LIKED ANNE NAY THAT SHE WAS VERY FOND OF ANNE BUT NOW SHE KNEW AS SHE HURRIED WILDLY DOWN THE SLOPE
AND THERE SEEMED LITTLE PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH IN THE SUMMER VACATION I SUPPOSE I'LL JUST HAVE TO DROP OUT NEXT YEAR SHE THOUGHT DREARILY AND TEACH A DISTRICT SCHOOL AGAIN UNTIL I EARN ENOUGH TO FINISH MY COURSE
FORTUNATELY SHE FELL ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE THE ROOF EXTENDED DOWN OVER THE PORCH SO NEARLY TO THE GROUND THAT A FALL THEREFROM WAS A MUCH LESS SERIOUS THING NEVERTHELESS WHEN DIANA AND THE OTHER GIRLS HAD RUSHED FRANTICALLY AROUND THE HOUSE
BRING HER IN HERE MISTER BARRY AND LAY HER ON THE SOFA MERCY ME THE CHILD HAS GONE AND FAINTED IT WAS QUITE TRUE OVERCOME BY THE PAIN OF HER INJURY ANNE HAD ONE MORE OF HER WISHES GRANTED TO HER SHE HAD FAINTED DEAD AWAY
SUITED HER SPRINGING STEP TO HIS YOU'VE BEEN WORKING TOO HARD TODAY MATTHEW SHE SAID REPROACHFULLY WHY WON'T YOU TAKE THINGS EASIER WELL NOW I CAN'T SEEM TO SAID MATTHEW
MAYBE HE WILL NOW YOU'RE HOME YOU ALWAYS CHEER HIM UP ANNE LEANED ACROSS THE TABLE AND TOOK MARILLA'S FACE IN HER HANDS YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AS WELL YOURSELF AS I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU MARILLA YOU LOOK TIRED I'M AFRAID YOU'VE BEEN WORKING TOO HARD
ANNE COMES TO GRIEF IN AN AFFAIR OF HONOR ANNE HAD TO LIVE THROUGH MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AS IT HAPPENED ALMOST A MONTH HAVING ELAPSED SINCE THE LINIMENT CAKE EPISODE IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HER TO GET INTO FRESH TROUBLE OF SOME SORT LITTLE MISTAKES
I WAS WALKING THE RIDGEPOLE AND I FELL OFF I EXPECT I HAVE SPRAINED MY ANKLE BUT MARILLA I MIGHT HAVE BROKEN MY NECK LET US LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THINGS I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN YOU'D GO AND DO SOMETHING OF THE SORT WHEN I LET YOU GO TO THAT PARTY SAID MARILLA SHARP AND SHREWISH IN HER VERY RELIEF
ADDRESSES WERE GIVEN ESSAYS READ SONGS SUNG THE PUBLIC AWARD OF DIPLOMAS PRIZES AND MEDALS MADE MATTHEW AND MARILLA WERE THERE WITH EYES AND EARS FOR ONLY ONE STUDENT ON THE PLATFORM A TALL GIRL IN PALE GREEN
WON'T THEY SOON BE TOO OLD TO GET MARRIED ANNE I HOPE GILBERT WON'T COURT YOU THAT LONG WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE MARRIED ANNE MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT'S A SURE THING MISSUS LYNDE IS A BEGAN ANNE HOTLY THEN STOPPED
WELL IT WASN'T RIGHT FOR HER TO SAY IT SAID ANNE PROMPTLY DECIDING UPON WHICH HORN OF THIS DILEMMA TO EMPALE HERSELF IT ISN'T RIGHT FOR ANYBODY TO TAKE THAT NAME IN VAIN OR SPEAK IT LIGHTLY DAVY DON'T EVER DO IT AGAIN
THE THREE CATS THE MERRY CHATTER OF THE GIRLS THE PLEASANTNESS OF FRIDAY EVENINGS WHEN COLLEGE FRIENDS DROPPED IN TO TALK OF GRAVE AND GAY ANNE WAS LONELY DIANA DURING THE WHOLE OF THE HOLIDAYS WAS IMPRISONED AT HOME WITH A BAD ATTACK OF BRONCHITIS SHE COULD NOT COME TO GREEN GABLES
SHE WAS ALWAYS KIND TO YOU SHE HAS BEEN KIND TO THE LAST MARILLA THIS LETTER IS FROM HER LAWYER SHE HAS LEFT ME A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN HER WILL GRACIOUS AIN'T THAT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY EXCLAIMED DAVY
AND I THINK I HAVE BEEN PUNISHED SO MUCH THAT YOU NEEDN'T BE VERY CROSS WITH ME MARILLA IT'S NOT A BIT NICE TO FAINT AFTER ALL AND THE DOCTOR HURT ME DREADFULLY WHEN HE WAS SETTING MY ANKLE I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO AROUND FOR SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS AND I'LL MISS THE NEW LADY TEACHER
NO SIREE ANNE I'D HAVE CUT ALL THEIR HEADS OFF MISSUS LYNDE WAS AWFUL MAD WHEN I SAID THAT AND SHUT THE BIBLE UP AND SAID SHE'D NEVER READ ME ANY MORE OF IT IF I TALKED LIKE THAT SO I DON'T TALK NOW WHEN SHE READS IT SUNDAY AFTERNOONS
SHE HAD MANY VISITORS AND NOT A DAY PASSED WITHOUT ONE OR MORE OF THE SCHOOLGIRLS DROPPING IN TO BRING HER FLOWERS AND BOOKS AND TELL HER ALL THE HAPPENINGS IN THE JUVENILE WORLD OF AVONLEA EVERYBODY HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND KIND MARILLA SIGHED ANNE HAPPILY
THAT ANNE WAS DEARER TO HER THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON EARTH MISTER BARRY WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HER SHE GASPED MORE WHITE AND SHAKEN THAN THE SELF CONTAINED SENSIBLE MARILLA HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS ANNE HERSELF ANSWERED LIFTING HER HEAD DON'T BE VERY FRIGHTENED MARILLA
AND HE'D ALWAYS BANKED WITH HIM MATTHEW SAID ANY BANK WITH HIM AT THE HEAD OF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY I THINK HE HAS ONLY BEEN ITS NOMINAL HEAD FOR MANY YEARS SAID ANNE HE IS A VERY OLD MAN HIS NEPHEWS ARE REALLY AT THE HEAD OF THE INSTITUTION WELL WHEN RACHEL TOLD US THAT
AT GREEN GABLES MARILLA WENT PROMPTLY TO MISSUS LYNDE'S DOMAIN WHEN GILBERT CAME AND INSISTED ON TAKING THE TWINS WITH HER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WAS UNMISTAKABLE AND ANNE WAS IN A HELPLESS FURY OVER IT DAVY HOWEVER WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX THE GLORY AND THE DREAM ON THE MORNING WHEN THE FINAL RESULTS OF ALL THE EXAMINATIONS WERE TO BE POSTED ON THE BULLETIN BOARD AT QUEEN'S ANNE AND JANE WALKED DOWN THE STREET TOGETHER
SHE WENT WITH MATTHEW FOR THE COWS THROUGH LOVERS LANE TO THE BACK PASTURE THE WOODS WERE ALL GLORIED THROUGH WITH SUNSET AND THE WARM SPLENDOR OF IT STREAMED DOWN THROUGH THE HILL GAPS IN THE WEST MATTHEW WALKED SLOWLY WITH BENT HEAD ANNE TALL AND ERECT
WHAT IS THE MATTER ANNE ASKED MARILLA MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY IS DEAD SAID ANNE IN A LOW TONE SO SHE HAS GONE AT LAST SAID MARILLA WELL SHE HAS BEEN SICK FOR OVER A YEAR
THEY FOUND ANNE LYING ALL WHITE AND LIMP AMONG THE WRECK AND RUIN OF THE VIRGINIA CREEPER ANNE ARE YOU KILLED SHRIEKED DIANA THROWING HERSELF ON HER KNEES BESIDE HER FRIEND OH ANNE DEAR ANNE SPEAK JUST ONE WORD TO ME AND TELL ME IF YOU'RE KILLED TO THE IMMENSE RELIEF OF ALL THE GIRLS
MARILLA WAS OUT IN THE ORCHARD PICKING A PANFUL OF SUMMER APPLES WHEN SHE SAW MISTER BARRY COMING OVER THE LOG BRIDGE AND UP THE SLOPE WITH MISSUS BARRY BESIDE HIM AND A WHOLE PROCESSION OF LITTLE GIRLS TRAILING AFTER HIM IN HIS ARMS HE CARRIED ANNE WHOSE HEAD LAY LIMPLY AGAINST HIS SHOULDER
I WANT TO SEE WHAT THEM PESKY GRITS ARE DOING I'M A CONSERVATIVE ANNE AND I TELL YOU YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON THEM GRITS MISTER HARRISON HAD BROUGHT THE MAIL AND MERRY LETTERS FROM STELLA AND PRISCILLA AND PHIL SOON DISSIPATED ANNE'S BLUES AUNT JAMESINA TOO HAD WRITTEN
THERE THERE I'M NOT CROSS SAID MARILLA YOU'RE AN UNLUCKY CHILD THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT AS YOU SAY YOU'LL HAVE THE SUFFERING OF IT HERE NOW TRY AND EAT SOME SUPPER ISN'T IT FORTUNATE I'VE GOT SUCH AN IMAGINATION SAID ANNE
NOT NOWADAYS SAID ANNE ABSENTLY AS THE WIND BLEW A SCUD OF SNOW AGAINST THE WINDOW OH DEAR WILL IT EVER STOP STORMING GOD KNOWS SAID DAVY AIRILY PREPARING TO RESUME HIS READING ANNE WAS SHOCKED THIS TIME
AND PATTY'S PLACE WILL BE OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT THERE I'M NOT GOING TO BE A COWARD I'M THANKFUL I CAN EARN MY WAY THROUGH IF NECESSARY HERE'S MISTER HARRISON WADING UP THE LANE ANNOUNCED DAVY RUNNING OUT I HOPE HE'S BROUGHT THE MAIL IT'S THREE DAYS SINCE WE GOT IT
ON THE DAY WHEN SHE COULD FIRST LIMP ACROSS THE FLOOR IT ISN'T VERY PLEASANT TO BE LAID UP BUT THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDE TO IT MARILLA YOU FIND OUT HOW MANY FRIENDS YOU HAVE WHY EVEN SUPERINTENDENT BELL CAME TO SEE ME AND HE'S REALLY A VERY FINE MAN NOT A KINDRED SPIRIT OF COURSE
THE WEATHER HAS BEEN REAL COLD SHE WROTE SO I LET THE CATS SLEEP IN THE HOUSE RUSTY AND JOSEPH ON THE SOFA IN THE LIVING ROOM AND THE SARAH CAT ON THE FOOT OF MY BED IT'S REAL COMPANY TO HEAR HER PURRING WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE NIGHT AND THINK OF MY POOR DAUGHTER IN THE FOREIGN FIELD
BUT JUST NOW I FEEL AS IF IT WERE JOY ENOUGH TO SIT HERE AND LOOK AT YOU I'M TIRED I THINK TIRED OF BEING STUDIOUS AND AMBITIOUS I MEAN TO SPEND AT LEAST TWO HOURS TOMORROW LYING OUT IN THE ORCHARD GRASS THINKING OF ABSOLUTELY NOTHING YOU'VE DONE SPLENDIDLY ANNE
WHEN CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME THE GIRLS OF PATTY'S PLACE SCATTERED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES
AND SHE SAT DOWN BY THE WINDOW IN THE FAST FALLING WINTRY TWILIGHT THE SUN HAD SET AND THE WIND HAD DIED DOWN A PALE CHILLY MOON LOOKED OUT BEHIND A BANK OF PURPLE CLOUDS IN THE WEST THE SKY FADED OUT BUT THE STRIP OF YELLOW ALONG THE WESTERN HORIZON GREW BRIGHTER AND FIERCER
AND THEN THE GIRLS WERE AROUND THEM AND ANNE WAS THE CENTER OF A LAUGHING CONGRATULATING GROUP HER SHOULDERS WERE THUMPED
SHE WAS PUSHED AND PULLED AND HUGGED AND AMONG IT ALL SHE MANAGED TO WHISPER TO JANE OH WON'T MATTHEW AND MARILLA BE PLEASED I MUST WRITE THE NEWS HOME RIGHT AWAY COMMENCEMENT WAS THE NEXT IMPORTANT HAPPENING THE EXERCISES WERE HELD IN THE BIG ASSEMBLY HALL OF THE ACADEMY
AND THE FRIDAY AFTERNOONS THEY DON'T HAVE RECITATIONS MISS STACY TAKES THEM ALL TO THE WOODS FOR A FIELD DAY AND THEY STUDY FERNS AND FLOWERS AND BIRDS
THAT IS WHAT RACHEL SAID SHE WAS UP HERE ONE DAY LAST WEEK AND SAID THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT IT MATTHEW FELT REAL WORRIED ALL WE HAVE SAVED IS IN THAT BANK EVERY PENNY I WANTED MATTHEW TO PUT IT IN THE SAVINGS BANK IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT OLD MISTER ABBEY WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF FATHER'S
AND LET THEM DARE AWAY SUCH ABSURDITY SAID MARILLA ANNE SIGHED BUT YOU HAVE SUCH STRENGTH OF MIND MARILLA I HAVEN'T I JUST FELT THAT I COULDN'T BEAR JOSIE PYE'S SCORN
SUCH AS ABSENTMINDEDLY EMPTYING A PAN OF SKIM MILK INTO A BASKET OF YARN BALLS IN THE PANTRY INSTEAD OF INTO THE PIGS BUCKET AND WALKING CLEAN OVER THE EDGE OF THE LOG BRIDGE INTO THE BROOK WHILE WRAPPED IN IMAGINATIVE REVERIE NOT REALLY BEING WORTH COUNTING
WHICH WERE NOT WHOLLY FULFILLED SHE FOUND AVONLEA IN THE GRIP OF SUCH AN EARLY COLD AND STORMY WINTER AS EVEN THE OLDEST INHABITANT COULD NOT RECALL GREEN GABLES WAS LITERALLY HEMMED IN BY HUGE DRIFTS ALMOST EVERY DAY OF THAT ILL STARRED VACATION IT STORMED FIERCELY
DAVY SHE EXCLAIMED REPROACHFULLY MISSUS LYNDE SAYS THAT PROTESTED DAVY ONE NIGHT LAST WEEK MARILLA SAID WILL LUDOVIC SPEED AND THEODORA DIX EVER GET MARRIED AND MISSUS LYNDE SAID GOD KNOWS' JUST LIKE THAT
JOSIE'S TRIUMPH BEING RATHER MORE PRONOUNCED THAN GOOD TASTE PERMITTED ANNE SHIRLEY DARED HER TO WALK ALONG THE TOP OF THE BOARD FENCE WHICH BOUNDED THE GARDEN TO THE EAST NOW TO WALK BOARD FENCES REQUIRES MORE SKILL AND STEADINESS OF HEAD AND HEEL
BECAUSE THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS ALL MY OWN FAULT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD IF I COULD BLAME IT ON ANYBODY I WOULD FEEL SO MUCH BETTER BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE MARILLA IF YOU HAD BEEN DARED TO WALK A RIDGEPOLE I'D HAVE STAYED ON GOOD FIRM GROUND
I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T BE TEACHING NOW THAT YOU'VE WON THE AVERY NO I'M GOING TO REDMOND IN SEPTEMBER DOESN'T IT SEEM WONDERFUL I'LL HAVE A BRAND NEW STOCK OF AMBITION LAID IN BY THAT TIME AFTER THREE GLORIOUS GOLDEN MONTHS OF VACATION JANE AND RUBY ARE GOING TO TEACH
AND ESPECIALLY OF JOSIE PYE WHO IN SPITE OF LACK OF IMAGINATION HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH HORRIBLE VISIONS OF A FUTURE BRANDED AS THE GIRL WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF ANNE SHIRLEY'S EARLY AND TRAGIC DEATH ANNE SAT DIZZILY UP AND ANSWERED UNCERTAINLY NO DIANA I AM NOT KILLED
DIANA WAS AT GREEN GABLES TO MEET HER IN HER OWN WHITE ROOM WHERE MARILLA HAD SET A FLOWERING HOUSE ROSE ON THE WINDOW SILL ANNE LOOKED ABOUT HER AND DREW A LONG BREATH OF HAPPINESS OH DIANA IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK AGAIN
JANE WAS SMILING AND HAPPY EXAMINATIONS WERE OVER AND SHE WAS COMFORTABLY SURE SHE HAD MADE A PASS AT LEAST FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS TROUBLED JANE NOT AT ALL SHE HAD NO SOARING AMBITIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS NOT AFFECTED WITH THE UNREST ATTENDANT THEREON
WHAT WOULD SHE DO WITHOUT THEIR INSPIRING RIVALRY WOULD NOT WORK EVEN AT A COEDUCATIONAL COLLEGE WITH A REAL DEGREE IN PROSPECT BE RATHER FLAT WITHOUT HER FRIEND THE ENEMY THE NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST IT SUDDENLY STRUCK ANNE THAT MATTHEW WAS NOT LOOKING WELL
OF A WONDERFUL HERO WHO SEEMED BLESSED WITH A MIRACULOUS FACULTY
IF IT WAS ANYWHERE BUT IN INDIA I WOULDN'T WORRY BUT THEY SAY THE SNAKES OUT THERE ARE TERRIBLE IT TAKES ALL THE SARAH CATS'S PURRING TO DRIVE AWAY THE THOUGHT OF THOSE SNAKES I HAVE ENOUGH FAITH FOR EVERYTHING BUT THE SNAKES I CAN'T THINK WHY PROVIDENCE EVER MADE THEM SOMETIMES I DON'T THINK HE DID
WITHOUT TRYING TO BREAK IT GENTLY AND WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T SYMPATHIZE WITH ME PROMISE ME THIS JANE JANE PROMISED SOLEMNLY BUT AS IT HAPPENED
JUST AS HE LOOKS IN SUNDAY SCHOOL ONLY SMALL NOW IT'S SO EASY TO IMAGINE MISSUS ALLAN AS A LITTLE GIRL MISSUS ALLAN HAS BEEN TO SEE ME FOURTEEN TIMES ISN'T THAT SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF MARILLA WHEN A MINISTER'S WIFE HAS SO MANY CLAIMS ON HER TIME
I COULDN'T GO TO ANY OF THE PLACES I'VE BEEN INVITED AND TAKE THOSE THREE CATS SHE SAID AND I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE POOR CREATURES HERE ALONE FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS
ISN'T IT SPLENDID TO THINK WE ALL GOT THROUGH EVEN TO MOODY SPURGEON AND JOSIE PYE THE NEWBRIDGE TRUSTEES HAVE OFFERED JANE THEIR SCHOOL ALREADY SAID DIANA GILBERT BLYTHE IS GOING TO TEACH TOO HE HAS TO HIS FATHER CAN'T AFFORD TO SEND HIM TO COLLEGE NEXT YEAR AFTER ALL
SHE NEVER TELLS YOU IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT AND SHE HOPES YOU'LL BE A BETTER GIRL ON ACCOUNT OF IT MISSUS LYNDE ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME AND SHE SAID IT IN A KIND OF WAY THAT MADE ME FEEL SHE MIGHT HOPE I'D BE A BETTER GIRL BUT DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE I WOULD EVEN JOSIE PYE CAME TO SEE ME
HE HAD BEEN SO SURE SHE WOULD WIN AND THEN SOMEBODY CALLED OUT THREE CHEERS FOR MISS SHIRLEY WINNER OF THE AVERY OH ANNE GASPED JANE AS THEY FLED TO THE GIRLS DRESSING ROOM AMID HEARTY CHEERS OH ANNE I'M SO PROUD ISN'T IT SPLENDID
IT'S ONLY THAT I'M GETTING OLD ANNE AND KEEP FORGETTING IT WELL WELL I'VE ALWAYS WORKED PRETTY HARD AND I'D RATHER DROP IN HARNESS IF I HAD BEEN THE BOY YOU SENT FOR SAID ANNE WISTFULLY I'D BE ABLE TO HELP YOU SO MUCH NOW AND SPARE YOU IN A HUNDRED WAYS
AND ON EACH EVENING THE STORM WAS SO WILD THAT NOBODY COULD GO SO THEY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT IN DESPAIR ANNE DESPITE HER LOVE OF AND LOYALTY TO GREEN GABLES COULD NOT HELP THINKING LONGINGLY OF PATTY'S PLACE ITS COSY OPEN FIRE
WHO COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE FACULTY COULD BE SO UNFAIR AS TO ORDER IT OTHERWISE I HAVE NOT HOPE OF THE AVERY SAID ANNE EVERYBODY SAYS EMILY CLAY WILL WIN IT
AS IF ALL THE STRAY GLEAMS OF LIGHT WERE CONCENTRATING IN ONE SPOT THE DISTANT HILLS RIMMED WITH PRIEST LIKE FIRS STOOD OUT IN DARK DISTINCTNESS AGAINST IT ANNE LOOKED ACROSS THE STILL WHITE FIELDS COLD AND LIFELESS IN THE HARSH LIGHT OF THAT GRIM SUNSET
WELL NOW I'D RATHER HAVE YOU THAN A DOZEN BOYS ANNE SAID MATTHEW PATTING HER HAND JUST MIND YOU THAT RATHER THAN A DOZEN BOYS WELL NOW I GUESS IT WASN'T A BOY THAT TOOK THE AVERY SCHOLARSHIP WAS IT IT WAS A GIRL MY GIRL
I THINK IT'S QUITE NATURAL THAT A NINE YEAR OLD BOY WOULD SOONER READ AN ADVENTURE STORY THAN THE BIBLE BUT WHEN YOU ARE OLDER
AND HE WON'T SPARE HIMSELF A MITE I'VE BEEN REAL WORRIED ABOUT HIM BUT HE'S SOME BETTER THIS WHILE BACK AND WE'VE GOT A GOOD HIRED MAN
WHAT'S THE MATTER WHERE HAVE YOU HURT YOURSELF DEMANDED MISSUS BARRY MY ANKLE GASPED ANNE OH DIANA PLEASE FIND YOUR FATHER AND ASK HIM TO TAKE ME HOME I KNOW I CAN NEVER WALK THERE AND I'M SURE I COULDN'T HOP SO FAR ON ONE FOOT WHEN JANE COULDN'T EVEN HOP AROUND THE GARDEN
HE REVELED IN GETTING OUT IN THE MORNING AND SHOVELING OUT THE PATHS TO THE WELL AND HENHOUSE HE GLORIED IN THE CHRISTMAS TIDE DELICACIES WHICH MARILLA AND MISSUS LYNDE VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN PREPARING FOR ANNE
ALBEIT IN MORTAL DREAD OF THE FAT GREEN CATERPILLARS WITH WHICH SAID TREE WAS INFESTED AND WITH THE FEAR OF HER MOTHER BEFORE HER EYES IF SHE SHOULD TEAR HER NEW MUSLIN DRESS NIMBLY DID
I RECEIVED HER AS POLITELY AS I COULD BECAUSE I THINK SHE WAS SORRY SHE DARED ME TO WALK A RIDGEPOLE IF I HAD BEEN KILLED SHE WOULD HAD TO CARRY A DARK BURDEN OF REMORSE ALL HER LIFE DIANA HAS BEEN A FAITHFUL FRIEND SHE'S BEEN OVER EVERY DAY TO CHEER MY LONELY PILLOW BUT OH
BALANCED HERSELF UPRIGHTLY ON THAT PRECARIOUS FOOTING AND STARTED TO WALK ALONG IT DIZZILY CONSCIOUS THAT SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLY HIGH UP IN THE WORLD AND THAT WALKING RIDGEPOLES WAS NOT A THING IN WHICH YOUR IMAGINATION HELPED YOU OUT MUCH NEVERTHELESS
ANNE LAUGHED AND PELTED DIANA WITH THE FADED JUNE LILIES OF HER BOUQUET STELLA MAYNARD IS THE DEAREST GIRL IN THE WORLD EXCEPT ONE AND YOU ARE THAT ONE DIANA SHE SAID I LOVE YOU MORE THAN EVER AND I'VE SO MANY THINGS TO TELL YOU
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED THAT STELLA MAYNARD BETTER THAN ME SAID DIANA REPROACHFULLY JOSIE PYE TOLD ME YOU DID
WOULD YOU SMILED ANNE DAVY PEERED CURIOUSLY AT HER YOU DON'T SEEM A BIT SHOCKED ANNE MISSUS LYNDE WAS AWFUL SHOCKED WHEN I SAID IT TO HER NO I'M NOT SHOCKED DAVY
THAT A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT WASN'T WORTH A DARE RELUCTANT ADMIRATION GREETED HER EXPLOIT FOR MOST OF THE OTHER GIRLS COULD APPRECIATE IT HAVING SUFFERED MANY THINGS THEMSELVES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO WALK FENCES JOSIE DESCENDED FROM HER PERCH FLUSHED WITH VICTORY AND DARTED A DEFIANT GLANCE AT ANNE
SO FREE FROM SHADOW AND SO LAVISH OF BLOSSOM ANNE SPENT SOME OF ITS RICH HOURS IN THE ORCHARD SHE WENT TO THE DRYAD'S BUBBLE AND WILLOWMERE AND VIOLET VALE SHE CALLED AT THE MANSE AND HAD A SATISFYING TALK WITH MISSUS ALLAN AND FINALLY IN THE EVENING
BUT THERE'S NOTHING EXCEPT MILLIONAIRES ON THIS STREET SO I'LL STAY HERE AND KEEP PATTY'S PLACE WARM FOR YOU
AND ALL THE SILLY THINGS THAT WERE DONE IN AVONLEA THAT SUMMER BECAUSE THE DOERS THEREOF WERE DARED TO DO THEM WOULD FILL A BOOK BY THEMSELVES FIRST OF ALL CARRIE SLOANE DARED RUBY GILLIS TO CLIMB TO A CERTAIN POINT IN THE HUGE OLD WILLOW TREE BEFORE THE FRONT DOOR WHICH RUBY GILLIS
SHE MANAGED TO TAKE SEVERAL STEPS BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE CAME THEN SHE SWAYED LOST HER BALANCE STUMBLED STAGGERED AND FELL SLIDING DOWN OVER THE SUN BAKED ROOF AND CRASHING OFF IT THROUGH THE TANGLE OF VIRGINIA CREEPER BENEATH ALL BEFORE THE DISMAYED CIRCLE BELOW COULD GIVE A SIMULTANEOUS
SHE HAD A CURIOUS INFECTIOUSNESS SHE LED ONE ON AND THE WAY HER UNSTEADY MIND LEAPED AT CONCLUSIONS WRONG ONES OF COURSE WITNESS THE ONE THAT SHE MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WAS MISERABLE
AS SHE HAD LEFT FREDERICK TO GOD NOTHING OF THIS MONEY WAS SPENT ON HER HOUSE OR DRESS THOSE REMAINED EXCEPT FOR THE GREAT SOFT SOFA AUSTERE
HOW SHE HAD BEEN INVITED A FRIEND HAD INVITED HER EASTER TOO EASTER WAS IN APRIL WASN'T IT
OF LEARNED MAINTENON THE POOR WERE THE FILTER THROUGH WHICH THE MONEY WAS PASSED TO COME OUT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT HOPED PURIFIED SHE COULD DO NO MORE
PERHAPS THEY NEED A HOLIDAY SUGGESTED MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AN UNSATISFACTORY A QUEER REPLY THE VICAR THOUGHT IN FEBRUARY HE CALLED AFTER HER SARCASTICALLY
IT GOT HOLD OF MISSUS WILKINS FIRST AND SPREAD FROM HER LIKE A ROSE COLOURED FLAME OVER HER PALE COMPANION MELLERSH AT CALAIS WHERE THEY RESTORED THEMSELVES WITH SOLES
SUGGESTED A GREAT CALM THAT COULD ONLY PROCEED FROM WISDOM BUT IF SHE WAS WISER OLDER AND CALMER MISSUS ARBUTHNOT'S NEW FRIEND
NEVERTHELESS SEEMED TO HER TO BE THE ONE WHO IMPELLED INCOHERENT SHE YET IMPELLED SHE APPEARED TO HAVE APART FROM HER NEED OF HELP AN UPSETTING KIND OF CHARACTER
THEY SEEMED TO QUICKEN UNSUSPECTED FACULTIES INTO LIFE SHE WAS SURE SHE HAD BEEN A THOROUGHLY AMUSING WOMAN BETWEEN LUNCH AND TEA AND A PRETTY ONE TOO SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN SHE HAD BEEN PRETTY
IT COULD BE THE NEXT NEST EGG WHOSE ORIGINAL CORRUPTION WOULD BE PURGED AWAY BY THE USE TO WHICH IT WAS FINALLY PUT FOR MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WHO HAD NO MONEY OF HER OWN WAS OBLIGED TO LIVE ON THE PROCEEDS OF FREDERICK'S ACTIVITIES
SO THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PUBLISH A BOOK OF MEMOIRS DURING EACH YEAR OF HIS MARRIED LIFE AND EVEN SO THERE WERE GREATER FURTHER PILES OF THESE LADIES WAITING TO BE DEALT WITH MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WAS HELPLESS
TIED TOGETHER BY A BLUE ENAMEL RIBBON ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN GOLD LETTERS ESTO PERPETUA MISTER WILKINS WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED BRUSHING HIS WIFE'S HAIR
BUT ALWAYS SHE HAD BEEN HANDICAPPED WHEN SHE TRIED TO BY BEING SO DREADFULLY FOND OF HIM AND SO MUCH AFRAID THAT FRESH WOUNDS WERE GOING TO BE GIVEN HER WRETCHED SOFT HEART BUT NOW
BY JUST AN INCOHERENT STRANGER IT WAS INDEED DISTURBING SHE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND HER SUDDEN LONGING
THERE WAS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD HE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED HE WOULD NOT CARE THE DAY WAS WRETCHED BLUSTERING AND WET THE CROSSING WAS ATROCIOUS AND THEY WERE VERY SICK
AND BY THE AFTERNOON OF THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY GOT INTO ITALY ENGLAND FREDERICK MELLERSH THE VICAR THE POOR HAMPSTEAD THE CLUB SHOOLBRED
LET HIM WOUND HER AS MUCH AS HE CHOSE AS MUCH AS HE POSSIBLY COULD SHE WOULD STILL HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM NOT THAT HE EVER INTENTIONALLY WOUNDED HER SHE KNEW HE NEVER MEANT TO
LIVING FOR OTHERS AND PRAYER AND THE PEACE TO BE FOUND IN PLACING ONESELF UNRESERVEDLY IN GOD'S HANDS TO MEET ALL THESE WORDS MISSUS WILKINS HAD OTHER WORDS INCOHERENT AND YET
HE HAD NOT HEARD SHE STOLE NEARER AND NEARER AND THE FIRE CRACKLED AND HE HEARD NOTHING SHE STOPPED A MOMENT UNABLE TO BREATHE SHE WAS AFRAID SUPPOSE HE
BUT AFTER WHAT ENTREATIES WHAT PASSIONATE PERSUADING MISSUS ARBUTHNOT HAD NOT IMAGINED SHE WOULD HAVE TO FACE MISTER WILKINS AND SAY THINGS TO HIM
AND PRETEND THEY WERE THEIRS SCRAP WHO HAD THAT AFFECTION FOR HER PARENTS WHICH WARMS IN ABSENCE WAS ATHIRST FOR NEWS AND BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED BY THE NEWS HE GRADUALLY IMPARTED
ONE WOMAN BEING HAPPY AND THESE PITEOUS MULTITUDES SHE WAS UNABLE TO LOOK THE VICAR IN THE FACE HE DID NOT KNOW NOBODY KNEW WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO
SHE HAD NOTHING NOBODY OF HER OWN TO LAVISH HERSELF ON THE POOR BECAME HER CHILDREN AND GOD THE OBJECT OF HER LOVE WHAT COULD BE HAPPIER THAN SUCH A LIFE SHE SOMETIMES ASKED HERSELF
AND ALSO ANY CHARMING FUNNY THINGS THAT HAD BEEN DONE OR MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE FOR HE COULD IMAGINE ALMOST ANYTHING SCRAP'S EYES GREW ROUND WITH WONDER AND AFFECTIONATE PRIDE IN HER MOTHER
AND ITS PLACE WAS TAKEN BY A KIND OF SUPPRESSED AND FRIGHTENED PLEASEDNESS WHICH WOULD HAVE LED A MORE WORLDLY MINDED AUDIENCE TO THE INSTANT CONVICTION OF RECENT AND PROBABLY IMPASSIONED LOVEMAKING
BETWEEN TEA AND DINNER THINKING OF HIM HARDER THAN EVER
MISSUS ARBUTHNOT SPOKE ON AND ON
AS THEY TURNED AWAY FROM THE LETTER BOX HOW IMMACULATELY GOOD WE'VE BEEN ALL OUR LIVES
WAS THROWING AWAY SPOILT TIE AFTER SPOILT TIE SCRAP IN HERS WAS HURRYING INTO A BLACK FROCK WITH A VAGUE NOTION THAT MISTER BRIGGS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE HER SO CLEARLY IN BLACK
SURE AS SHE SO MISERABLY WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO ANYTHING SHE DID SHE MERELY WROTE HIM A NOTE AND PUT IT ON THE HALL TABLE READY FOR HIM IF AND WHEN HE SHOULD COME HOME
SHOWN HERSELF VERY CALM TO MISSUS WILKINS VERY PRACTICAL AND SOBER CONCEALING HER OWN EXCITEMENT BUT SHE WAS REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY MOVED AND SHE FELT HAPPY AND SHE FELT GUILTY
UNREPUDIATED BECAUSE OF HER CONVICTION THAT HERE WAS ANOTHER FELLOW CREATURE IN URGENT NEED OF HER HELP AND NOT JUST BOOTS AND BLANKETS AND BETTER SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS THIS TIME
AND SHE HAD NOT YET EVEN PREPARED THE FORM OF WORDS IN WHICH SHE WOULD BREAK IT MISTER WILKINS WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABROAD SINCE BEFORE THE WAR AND WAS NOTICING WITH INCREASING DISGUST
DRAWING ROOM DOOR WAS OPEN AND THE HOUSE WAS QUIET WITH THE HUSH THAT PRECEDES DINNER WHEN THE INHABITANTS ARE ALL SHUT UP IN THEIR ROOMS DRESSING BRIGGS IN HIS ROOM
AND MISTER ARUNDEL STILL WENT ON AMUSING HER AND IT WAS A QUARTER TO EIGHT BEFORE SHE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED DINNER OH GOOD HEAVENS SHE EXCLAIMED JUMPING UP YES IT'S LATE SAID ARUNDEL
AND WHEN THE LETTER HAD BEEN POSTED IN THE LETTER BOX IN THE HALL AND ACTUALLY WAS BEYOND GETTING BACK AGAIN BOTH SHE AND MISSUS WILKINS FELT THE SAME SENSE OF GUILT IT ONLY SHOWS
AND VERY NEARLY SHE STUCK A CRIMSON CAMELLIA IN HER HAIR DOWN BY HER EAR SHE DID HOLD IT THERE FOR A MINUTE AND IT LOOKED ALMOST SINFULLY ATTRACTIVE AND WAS EXACTLY THE COLOUR OF HER MOUTH
SHE HUNG HIM UP FINALLY BY HER BEDSIDE AS THE CHIEF SUBJECT OF HER PRAYERS AND LEFT HIM EXCEPT FOR THOSE ENTIRELY TO GOD SHE HAD LOVED FREDERICK TOO DEEPLY
SO HE NEEDED HER FOR HE HAD COME INSTANTLY SO HE TOO MUST HAVE BEEN THINKING LONGING HER HEART WHICH HAD SEEMED TO STOP BEATING WAS SUFFOCATING HER NOW
OH NO NOT TILL APRIL SAID MISSUS ARBUTHNOT OVER HER SHOULDER VERY ODD THOUGHT THE VICAR VERY ODD INDEED AND HE WENT HOME AND WAS NOT PERHAPS QUITE CHRISTIAN
THERE BEING FIVE IN THAT MARCH AND IT BEING ON THE FIFTH OF THEM THAT SHE AND MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WERE TO START SHE WOULD TELL MELLERSH OF HER INVITATION ON THE THIRD SUNDAY THEN AFTER A VERY WELL COOKED LUNCH
SOON SHE WOULD BE BACK WITH THEM AGAIN AND WHAT WOULD A CAMELLIA BEHIND HER EAR SEEM LIKE THEN SIMPLY FANTASTIC BUT ON ONE THING SHE WAS DETERMINED
THE FIRST THING SHE WOULD DO WHEN SHE GOT HOME WOULD BE TO HAVE IT OUT WITH FREDERICK IF HE DIDN'T COME TO SAN SALVATORE THAT IS WHAT SHE WOULD DO THE VERY FIRST THING LONG AGO SHE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE THIS
FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST TILL ONE HAD HAD MORE TIME DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THE EXACT RIGHT WORDS WERE A SUGGESTION THAT IT WOULD DO NO HARM TO ANSWER THE ADVERTISEMENT NON COMMITTAL MERE INQUIRY
WHEN MISSUS WILKINS HER HEART IN HER MOUTH
SHE MUST GO AND PUT HER FACE IN IT BUT SHE NEVER GOT TO THE LILAC SHE WENT ONE STEP TOWARDS IT AND THEN STOOD STILL FOR SHE HAD SEEN THE FIGURE LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW IN THE FARTHEST CORNER
AFTER THOSE EARLY PAINFUL ATTEMPTS TO HOLD HIM UP TO THE POINT FROM WHICH THEY HAD HAND IN HAND SO SPLENDIDLY STARTED ATTEMPTS IN WHICH SHE HERSELF HAD GOT TERRIBLY HURT AND THE FREDERICK SHE SUPPOSED SHE HAD MARRIED WAS MANGLED OUT OF RECOGNITION
THEY GOT UP SIMULTANEOUSLY MISSUS ARBUTHNOT HAD A SENSATION OF SURPRISE THAT MISSUS WILKINS SHOULD BE SO TALL AND WENT TO A WRITING TABLE
HE ONLY BEGAN IT AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE WHEN SHE MARRIED HIM HE HAD BEEN A BLAMELESS OFFICIAL ATTACHED TO THE LIBRARY OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM TO PUBLISH THE MEMOIRS UNDER ANOTHER NAME SO THAT SHE WAS NOT PUBLICLY BRANDED HAMPSTEAD READ THE BOOKS WITH GLEE
AND WE ARE UNHAPPY THERE ARE MISERABLE SORTS OF GOODNESS AND HAPPY SORTS THE SORT WE'LL HAVE AT THE MEDIAEVAL CASTLE FOR INSTANCE IS THE HAPPY SORT THAT IS SUPPOSING WE GO THERE SAID MISSUS ARBUTHNOT RESTRAININGLY
WHAT SORT OF A FACE DID LLOYD GEORGE MAKE SHE LAUGHED AND LAUGHED AND HAD A GREAT LONGING TO HUG HER MOTHER AND THE TIME FLEW AND IT GREW QUITE DUSK AND IT GREW NEARLY DARK
SHE KNEW HE OFTEN HAD NO IDEA OF HAVING DONE IT FOR A PERSON WHO WROTE BOOKS THOUGHT ROSE FREDERICK DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH IMAGINATION ANYHOW SHE SAID TO HERSELF
BUT AFTER HAVING BEEN VERY SICK JUST TO ARRIVE AT CALAIS AND NOT BE SICK WAS HAPPINESS AND IT WAS THERE THAT THE REAL SPLENDOUR OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING FIRST BEGAN TO WARM THEIR BENUMBED SPIRITS
AND ALL HER WAITING AND DEPENDENT POOR WERE LISTENING AND CONDEMNING IT ISN'T AS IF IT COMMITTED US TO ANYTHING SAID MISSUS WILKINS ALSO IN A LOW VOICE BUT HER VOICE SHOOK
MISSUS ARBUTHNOT ALWAYS SILENT ABOUT HIM HAD SAID NOTHING OF THIS TO MISSUS WILKINS FREDERICK WENT TOO DEEP INTO HER HEART FOR HER TO TALK ABOUT HIM
AS WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK OF WIND AND RAIN THE PECULIAR PERSISTENT VILENESS OF THE WEATHER AND SLOWLY CONCEIVED A DESIRE TO GET AWAY FROM ENGLAND FOR EASTER
CROSS EXAMINED HER WITH THE UTMOST SEVERITY HE DEMANDED THAT SHE REFUSE THE INVITATION HE DEMANDED THAT SINCE SHE HAD SO OUTRAGEOUSLY ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM
CHAPTER TWENTY SCRAP WANTED TO KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT HER MOTHER THAT ARUNDEL HAD PRESENTLY TO INVENT HE WOULD TALK ABOUT ANYTHING SHE WISHED
EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING THE WHOLE INFLAMED SORE DREARINESS
WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS MISTER WILKINS COMING BACK DAILY TO HIS DINNER AND EATING HIS FISH IN THE SILENCE OF IMAGINED SECURITY
AN UNUSUAL QUALITY THEY BECAME AMUSING MOTHER SAID THAT SCRAP INTERRUPTED SURPRISED AND PRESENTLY LADY DROITWICH BEGAN TO DO AMUSING THINGS AS WELL AS SAY THEM
SHE LOOKED AT HER LITTLE CLOCK STILL TEN MINUTES BEFORE DINNER TIRED OF STAYING IN HER BEDROOM SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD GO ON TO MISSUS FISHER'S BATTLEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE EMPTY AT THIS HOUR
GETTING UP FROM THE DRESSING TABLE THINGS COULDN'T GO ON LIKE THIS SHE WOULD HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM THIS SEPARATE LIFE THIS FREEZING LONELINESS
THEN HE WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR AT BREAKFAST HAVING LET HIMSELF IN WITH HIS LATCHKEY THE NIGHT BEFORE VERY JOVIAL AND GOOD NATURED AND FREE HANDED AND GLAD IF SHE WOULD ALLOW HIM TO GIVE HER SOMETHING A WELL FED MAN CONTENTED WITH THE WORLD
BUT OF COURSE IT COULDN'T GO ON ONCE CAROLINE APPEARED ROSE KNEW HER PLACE SHE COULD SEE AS WELL AS ANY ONE THE UNUSUALLY
IT WAS A DREADFUL AFTERNOON MELLERSH PROFOUNDLY INDIGNANT BESIDES HAVING HIS INTENDED TREAT COMING BACK ON HIM LIKE A BLESSING TO ROOST
OF LADY CAROLINE HOW WARM THOUGH THINGS LIKE ADMIRATION AND APPRECIATION MADE ONE FEEL HOW CAPABLE OF REALLY DESERVING THEM HOW DIFFERENT HOW GLOWING
FOR INATTENTION AT SUCH A MOMENT WAS DEPLORABLE OF TAKING YOU TO ITALY FOR EASTER DID YOU NOT HEAR ME YES SHE HAD HEARD HIM
THERE SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DIRECT TO LEAD TO ADVISE TO SUPPORT EXCEPT FREDERICK SHE LONG SINCE HAD LEARNED TO LEAVE FREDERICK TO GOD BEING LED HERSELF BEING INFLUENCED AND THROWN OFF HER FEET BY JUST AN ADVERTISEMENT
A HAD A HOUSE THERE IN FACT MISSUS WILKINS DRIVEN BY TERROR GUILT AND SURPRISE HAD BEEN MORE INCOHERENT IF POSSIBLE THAN USUAL
I MUST TRY AND HELP HER NOT TO ALOUD SHE SAID GRAVELY I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU INSIST THAT I'M NOT HAPPY WHEN YOU KNOW ME BETTER I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT I AM
WHICH WAS THE SCENE OF HIS EXHUMATIONS AND THERE HE WENT EVERY MORNING AND HE CAME BACK LONG AFTER HIS WIFE WAS ASLEEP SOMETIMES HE DID NOT COME BACK AT ALL SOMETIMES SHE DID NOT SEE HIM FOR SEVERAL DAYS TOGETHER
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE LEAST NEED OF ANY OF THE THINGS HE USED TO SAY WERE SO IMPORTANT AND BEAUTIFUL LOVE HOME COMPLETE COMMUNION OF THOUGHTS COMPLETE IMMERSION IN EACH OTHER'S INTERESTS
HE ASKED NO QUESTIONS SHE WAS SCARLET HE LOOKED AT HER A MOMENT AND THEN LOOKED AWAY IT WAS A RELIEF TO FREDERICK THAT SHE SHOULD TAKE SOME MONEY SHE GAVE IT ALL IMMEDIATELY TO THE ORGANIZATION SHE WORKED WITH
PEOPLE WOULD CEASE TO WANT TO READ OF WICKEDNESS AND THEN FREDERICK WOULD NEED SUPPORTING ON HELPING THE POOR THE PARISH FLOURISHED BECAUSE TO TAKE A HANDFUL AT RANDOM
AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SHE WAS UNABLE TO LOOK ANYBODY IN THE FACE SHE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM MAKING SPEECHES APPEALING FOR MONEY HOW COULD SHE STAND UP AND ASK PEOPLE FOR MONEY
LOTTY WOULD HAVE REMOVED IT BY THE FRANK COMMENTS SHE MADE WHILE SHE AND ROSE SAT TOGETHER AFTER TEA ON THE WALL LOTTY WAS DELIGHTED AT MORE LOVE BEING INTRODUCED INTO SAN SALVATORE EVEN IF IT WERE ONLY ONE SIDED
AND SHE FELT AFRAID AND SHE HAD ALL THE FEELINGS THOUGH THIS SHE DID NOT KNOW OF A WOMAN WHO WAS COME AWAY FROM A SECRET MEETING WITH HER LOVER THAT INDEED WAS WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE
NOT A SINGLE OFFICIAL AT CALAIS CARED A FIG FOR MELLERSH IN PARIS THERE WAS NO TIME TO THINK OF HIM BECAUSE THEIR TRAIN WAS LATE
TERROR AND DETERMINATION TOLD HER HUSBAND THAT SHE HAD BEEN INVITED TO ITALY AND HE DECLINED TO BELIEVE IT OF COURSE HE DECLINED TO BELIEVE IT
HOW GAY IT LOOKED THE FIRE TRANSFORMED THE ROOM A DARK UGLY ROOM IN THE DAYTIME IT WAS TRANSFORMED JUST AS SHE HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED BY THE WARMTH OF
TO SPEND ONE'S OWN HARD COLLECTED SAVINGS ON BEING HAPPY
BUT HER FACE AND PARTICULARLY HER EYES CONTINUED SAD PERHAPS WHEN WE'RE OLD PERHAPS WHEN WE ARE BOTH QUITE OLD
BUT NO SOUND CAME OR IF IT DID THE CRACKLING OF THE FIRE COVERED IT UP SHE MUST GO NEARER SHE BEGAN TO CREEP TOWARDS HIM SOFTLY SOFTLY HE DID NOT MOVE
AND WATCH THE MOON RISE OUT OF THE SEA SHE WENT INTO THE DESERTED UPPER HALL WITH THIS INTENTION BUT WAS ATTRACTED ON HER WAY ALONG IT BY THE FIRELIGHT SHINING THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR OF THE DRAWING ROOM
AND AT THE END OF THE MEETING HER EYES
SHE FELT THAT MISSUS WILKINS NEEDED HOLDING ON TO AFTER ALL WE'VE ONLY WRITTEN JUST TO ASK ANYBODY MAY DO THAT I THINK IT QUITE LIKELY WE SHALL FIND THE CONDITIONS IMPOSSIBLE
WERE TO ARRIVE ON THE MORNING OF APRIL SECOND IN THIS WAY EVERYTHING WOULD BE GOT NICELY READY FOR THE TWO WHO SEEMED IN SPITE OF THE EQUALITY OF THE SHARING YET TO HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT THEM OF GUESTS
I AM THINKING OF TAKING YOU TO ITALY FOR EASTER AND PAUSED FOR HER ASTOUNDED AND GRATEFUL ECSTASY NONE CAME THE SILENCE IN THE ROOM
OR EVEN TO REFLECT WERE USELESS IT YET INFLUENCED HER MISSUS WILKINS'S EYES HAD BEEN THE EYES OF A SEER SOME PEOPLE WERE LIKE THAT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT KNEW
IT WAS THE POOR WHO PROFITED THEIR VERY BOOTS WERE STOUT WITH SINS BUT HOW DIFFICULT IT HAD BEEN MISSUS ARBUTHNOT GROPING FOR GUIDANCE PRAYED ABOUT IT TO EXHAUSTION
THE WAY IT RACED ALONG FREDERICK DID LOVE HER THEN HE MUST LOVE HER OR WHY HAD HE COME SOMETHING PERHAPS HER ABSENCE HAD MADE HIM TURN TO HER WANT HER
AND FOUND HERSELF MORE TANGLED IN DOUBTS THAN EVER MISSUS WILKINS ON THE CONTRARY HAD NO DOUBTS SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS A MOST PROPER THING TO HAVE A HOLIDAY AND ALTOGETHER RIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL
IN ORDER TO ANSWER HER INQUIRES AND KEEP HER THERE TO HIMSELF HE PROCEEDED TO INVENT IT WAS QUITE EASY TO FASTEN SOME OF THE ENTERTAINING THINGS HE WAS CONSTANTLY THINKING ON TO OTHER PEOPLE
REALLY MOST EXTRAORDINARY
SHE HAD TRIED IN DAYS GONE BY TO THINK THE SITUATION OUT TO DISCOVER THE EXACT RIGHT COURSE FOR HER TO TAKE BUT HAD FOUND IT AS SHE HAD FOUND FREDERICK TOO DIFFICULT AND HAD LEFT IT
THUS FAR IN THIS THIRD WEEK HAD HE PROGRESSED IN DEMONSTRATIVENESS WHILE SHE FOR HER PART SITTING ON A CHAIR IN FRONT OF HIM PUT HIS STUDS IN A CLEAN SHIRT AND ROSE
EACH ONE CONVINCED THAT THEY NEEDED CONTRIBUTIONS THEMSELVES SHE LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE WERE HIDING SOMETHING DISCREDITABLE BUT DELIGHTFUL CERTAINLY HER CUSTOMARY CLEAR EXPRESSION OF CANDOR WAS NOT THERE
SHE WAS STARING STRAIGHT INTO THE FIRE AND IT WAS NO DOUBT THE FIRE THAT MADE HER FACE SO RED I AM THINKING HE REPEATED RAISING HIS CLEAR CULTIVATED VOICE AND SPEAKING WITH ACERBITY
FANCY MOTHER WHAT AN OLD DARLING DID SHE REALLY DO THAT HOW PERFECTLY ADORABLE OF HER AND DID SHE REALLY SAY BUT HOW WONDERFUL OF HER TO THINK OF IT
WE FEEL GUILTY I'M AFRAID I CAN'T SAY I'VE BEEN IMMACULATELY GOOD GENTLY PROTESTED MISSUS ARBUTHNOT A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE AT THIS FRESH EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL LEAPING AT CONCLUSIONS
ARUNDEL FOLLOWED HE DID NOT WISH TO ARRIVE TOO HOT SO HAD TO GO SLOWLY FORTUNATELY HE WAS NEAR THE TOP AND FRANCESCA CAME DOWN THE PERGOLA TO PILOT HIM INDOORS
BOX ONE THOUSAND THE TIMES FOR PARTICULARS SHE ASKED FOR ALL PARTICULARS BUT THE ONLY ONE THEY REALLY WANTED WAS THE ONE ABOUT THE RENT THEY BOTH FELT THAT IT WAS MISSUS ARBUTHNOT WHO OUGHT TO WRITE THE LETTER AND DO THE BUSINESS PART
CHAPTER FOUR IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED THAT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AND MISSUS WILKINS TRAVELING TOGETHER SHOULD ARRIVE AT SAN SALVATORE ON THE EVENING OF MARCH THIRTY FIRST
SHE STILL BUZZED SHE STILL TINGLED JUST AT THE REMEMBRANCE WHAT FUN IT HAD BEEN HAVING AN ADMIRER EVEN FOR THAT LITTLE WHILE NO WONDER PEOPLE LIKED ADMIRERS
WHEN SHE HERSELF WAS SPENDING SO MUCH ON HER OWN SELFISH PLEASURE NOR DID IT HELP HER OR QUIET HER THAT HAVING ACTUALLY TOLD FREDERICK IN HER DESIRE TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT SHE WAS SQUANDERING THAT SHE WOULD BE GRATEFUL
PROBABLY SHE WAS ABSORBED IN SOME FOOLISH DAY DREAM IT WAS REGRETTABLE HOW CHILDISH SHE REMAINED HE TURNED HIS HEAD THEIR CHAIRS WERE IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND LOOKED AT HER
WE'RE NOT ANY LONGER REAL HUMAN BEINGS REAL HUMAN BEINGS AREN'T EVER AS GOOD AS WE'VE BEEN OH SHE CLENCHED HER THIN HANDS TO THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO BE SO HAPPY NOW
MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AS SHE PRESENTLY SPLASHED THOUGH THE DRIPPING STREETS ON HER WAY TO A MEETING SHE WAS TO SPEAK AT WAS IN AN UNUSUALLY DISTURBED CONDITION OF MIND SHE HAD SHE HOPED
AND OUTSIDE THE DEEP SLITS OF WINDOWS HUNG THE BLUE CURTAIN OF THE NIGHT HOW PRETTY WHAT A SWEET PLACE SAN SALVATORE WAS AND THAT GORGEOUS LILAC ON THE TABLE
HOWEVER MUCH ONE TABULATED WAS YET A MYSTERY THERE WERE ALWAYS SOME PEOPLE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLACE FREDERICK WAS ONE OF THEM HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BEAR THE REMOTEST RESEMBLANCE TO THE ORIGINAL FREDERICK
FOR SHE HAD NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT HER FEELING OF GUILT OH BUT I'M SURE YOU HAVE I SEE YOU BEING GOOD AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT HAPPY SHE SHOULDN'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT THOUGHT MISSUS ARBUTHNOT
HE TOLD MISSUS ARBUTHNOT AS A MATTER OF HONOUR NOT TO MENTION IT AND AT LEAST HER LITTLE HOUSE WAS NOT HAUNTED BY THE LOOSE LIVED LADIES FOR FREDERICK DID HIS WORK AWAY FROM HOME HE HAD TWO ROOMS NEAR THE BRITISH MUSEUM
