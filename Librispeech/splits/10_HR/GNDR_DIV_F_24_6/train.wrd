ENCOURAGED HIS HORSE MADE ODD NOISES AND DROVE ON AND CATHERINE ANGRY AND VEXED AS SHE WAS HAVING NO POWER OF GETTING AWAY WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE POINT AND SUBMIT HER REPROACHES HOWEVER WERE NOT SPARED
MY SWEET CATHERINE IN YOUR GENEROUS HEART I KNOW IT WOULD SIGNIFY NOTHING BUT WE MUST NOT EXPECT SUCH DISINTERESTEDNESS IN MANY AS FOR MYSELF I AM SURE I ONLY WISH OUR SITUATIONS WERE REVERSED HAD I THE COMMAND OF MILLIONS WERE I MISTRESS OF THE WHOLE WORLD YOUR BROTHER WOULD
I AM SURE THEY WILL CONSENT WAS HER FREQUENT DECLARATION I AM SURE THEY WILL BE DELIGHTED WITH YOU FOR MY OWN PART SAID ISABELLA MY WISHES ARE SO MODERATE THAT THE SMALLEST INCOME IN NATURE WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME
BEFORE THE DELIVERY OF THE LETTERS A NEEDFUL EXERTION FOR AS THE TIME OF REASONABLE EXPECTATION DREW NEAR ISABELLA BECAME MORE AND MORE DESPONDING AND BEFORE THE LETTER ARRIVED HAD WORKED HERSELF INTO A STATE OF REAL DISTRESS
THE RAIN CONTINUED FAST THOUGH NOT HEAVY CATHERINE WENT EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO THE CLOCK THREATENING ON EACH RETURN THAT IF IT STILL KEPT ON RAINING ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES SHE WOULD GIVE UP THE MATTER AS HOPELESS
BUT I HAVE A NOTION MISS MORLAND YOU AND I THINK PRETTY MUCH ALIKE UPON MOST MATTERS PERHAPS WE MAY
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE LIKE ME I DARE SAY ONLY A GREAT DEAL BETTER GOOD MORNING TO YOU BUT I SAY MISS MORLAND I SHALL COME AND PAY MY RESPECTS AT FULLERTON BEFORE IT IS LONG IF NOT DISAGREEABLE PRAY DO
THERE WILL BE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN THE PUMP ROOM IF IT RAINS ALL THE MORNING I HOPE MISTER ALLEN WILL PUT ON HIS GREATCOAT WHEN HE GOES BUT I DARE SAY HE WILL NOT FOR HE HAD RATHER DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD THAN WALK OUT IN A GREATCOAT I WONDER HE SHOULD DISLIKE IT IT MUST BE SO COMFORTABLE
YOU ARE TO THANK YOUR BROTHER AND ME FOR THE SCHEME IT DARTED INTO OUR HEADS AT BREAKFAST TIME I VERILY BELIEVE AT THE SAME INSTANT AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF TWO HOURS AGO IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS DETESTABLE RAIN BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE NIGHTS ARE MOONLIGHT AND WE SHALL DO DELIGHTFULLY
DECLARED HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO MEN SO MUCH ALIKE IN HIS LIFE AND WOULD HARDLY GIVE UP THE POINT OF ITS HAVING BEEN TILNEY HIMSELF THEIR DRIVE EVEN WHEN THIS SUBJECT WAS OVER WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY AGREEABLE
PONDERING OVER THESE HEART RENDING TIDINGS CATHERINE WALKED SLOWLY UPSTAIRS AT THE HEAD OF THEM SHE WAS MET BY MISTER ALLEN WHO ON HEARING THE REASON OF THEIR SPEEDY RETURN
AND IN ONE MOMENT ALL WAS JOYFUL SECURITY THE BRIGHTEST GLOW WAS INSTANTLY SPREAD OVER ISABELLA'S FEATURES ALL CARE AND ANXIETY SEEMED REMOVED HER SPIRITS BECAME ALMOST TOO HIGH FOR CONTROL AND SHE CALLED HERSELF WITHOUT SCRUPLE
OR EVEN OF HAVING THEIR LAMP THEIR ONLY LAMP EXTINGUISHED BY A SUDDEN GUST OF WIND AND OF BEING LEFT IN TOTAL DARKNESS IN THE MEANWHILE THEY PROCEEDED ON THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT ANY MISCHANCE AND WERE WITHIN VIEW OF THE TOWN OF KEYNSHAM
IN MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN BY THE COMMUNICATION OF THE WONDERFUL EVENT HOW GREAT WAS HER DISAPPOINTMENT THE IMPORTANT AFFAIR WHICH MANY WORDS OF PREPARATION USHERED IN HAD BEEN FORESEEN BY THEM BOTH EVER SINCE HER BROTHER'S ARRIVAL
AND I HAVE ALMOST BROKE MY ARM WITH PULLING HIM IN TO THAT CURSED BROKEN WINDED JADE'S PACE MORLAND IS A FOOL FOR NOT KEEPING A HORSE AND GIG OF HIS OWN NO HE IS NOT SAID CATHERINE WARMLY
FOR YOU KNOW MISS TILNEY MAY STILL CALL MISSUS ALLEN AGREED TO IT JOHN THORPE WAS SOON WITH THEM AND HIS VOICE WAS WITH THEM YET SOONER FOR ON THE STAIRS HE WAS CALLING OUT TO MISS MORLAND TO BE QUICK MAKE HASTE MAKE HASTE AS HE THREW OPEN THE DOOR
IT WILL BE SO DIRTY OH THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY I NEVER MIND DIRT NO REPLIED HER FRIEND VERY PLACIDLY I KNOW YOU NEVER MIND DIRT AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
OR AT LEAST IN TUSCANY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE THE NIGHT THAT POOR SAINT AUBIN DIED SUCH BEAUTIFUL WEATHER AT HALF PAST TWELVE WHEN CATHERINE'S ANXIOUS ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER WAS OVER AND SHE COULD NO LONGER CLAIM ANY MERIT FROM ITS AMENDMENT
CONTAINING THE SAME THREE PEOPLE THAT HAD SURPRISED HER SO MUCH A FEW MORNINGS BACK ISABELLA MY BROTHER AND MISTER THORPE I DECLARE THEY ARE COMING FOR ME PERHAPS BUT I SHALL NOT GO I CANNOT GO INDEED
CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MORROW BROUGHT A VERY SOBER LOOKING MORNING THE SUN MAKING ONLY A FEW EFFORTS TO APPEAR AND CATHERINE AUGURED FROM IT EVERYTHING MOST FAVOURABLE TO HER WISHES
SHE WAS LESS AND LESS DISPOSED EITHER TO BE AGREEABLE HERSELF OR TO FIND HER COMPANION SO AND THEY RETURNED TO PULTENEY STREET WITHOUT HER SPEAKING TWENTY WORDS AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE THE FOOTMAN TOLD HER THAT A GENTLEMAN AND LADY HAD CALLED
AS HER FANCY REPRESENTED BLAIZE CASTLE TO BE WAS SUCH A COUNTERPOISE OF GOOD AS MIGHT CONSOLE HER FOR ALMOST ANYTHING THEY PASSED BRISKLY DOWN PULTENEY STREET AND THROUGH LAURA PLACE WITHOUT THE EXCHANGE OF MANY WORDS
AND IF SHE HAD NOT A PENNY WHY SO MUCH THE BETTER VERY TRUE I THINK LIKE YOU THERE IF THERE IS A GOOD FORTUNE ON ONE SIDE THERE CAN BE NO OCCASION FOR ANY ON THE OTHER NO MATTER WHICH HAS IT SO THAT THERE IS ENOUGH
TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF CURIOSITY
MADE HIS FRIEND PULL UP TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER THE OTHERS THEN CAME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR CONVERSATION AND MORLAND SAID WE HAD BETTER GO BACK THORPE IT IS TOO LATE TO GO ON TODAY
BUT THE TILNEYS WERE ENTIRELY TO BLAME WHY WERE NOT THEY MORE PUNCTUAL IT WAS DIRTY INDEED BUT WHAT DID THAT SIGNIFY I AM SURE JOHN AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE MINDED IT I NEVER MIND GOING THROUGH ANYTHING WHERE A FRIEND IS CONCERNED THAT IS MY DISPOSITION
I THOUGHT HOW IT WOULD BE SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WALK FOR ME TODAY SIGHED CATHERINE BUT PERHAPS IT MAY COME TO NOTHING OR IT MAY HOLD UP BEFORE TWELVE PERHAPS IT MAY BUT THEN MY DEAR
IT WAS TO CATHERINE THE MOST SURPRISING INSENSIBILITY THE DISCLOSURE HOWEVER OF THE GREAT SECRET OF JAMES'S GOING TO FULLERTON THE DAY BEFORE DID RAISE SOME EMOTION IN MISSUS ALLEN SHE COULD NOT LISTEN TO THAT WITH PERFECT CALMNESS
THE TWO YOUNGEST MISS THORPES WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE PARLOUR AND ON ANNE'S QUITTING IT TO CALL HER SISTER CATHERINE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING THE OTHER FOR SOME PARTICULARS OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY
TWICE WAS HE CALLED ALMOST FROM THE DOOR BY HER EAGERNESS TO HAVE HIM GONE INDEED MORLAND I MUST DRIVE YOU AWAY CONSIDER HOW FAR YOU HAVE TO RIDE I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU LINGER SO FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE WASTE NO MORE TIME
AND SO YOU GUESSED IT THE MOMENT YOU HAD MY NOTE SLY CREATURE OH MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU ALONE WHO KNOW MY HEART CAN JUDGE OF MY PRESENT HAPPINESS YOUR BROTHER IS THE MOST CHARMING OF MEN I ONLY WISH I WERE MORE WORTHY OF HIM
THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS MISSUS THORPE WITH TEARS OF JOY EMBRACED HER DAUGHTER HER SON HER VISITOR AND COULD HAVE EMBRACED HALF THE INHABITANTS OF BATH WITH SATISFACTION
THE ANXIOUS AFFECTION WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING CONTINUALLY WATCHED IN ISABELLA'S EVERY LOOK AND ACTION HAD IN THE COURSE OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY RECEIVED THE DELIGHTFUL CONFESSION OF AN EQUAL LOVE HER HEART AND FAITH WERE ALIKE ENGAGED TO JAMES
OF WHICH THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LIFE CAN HARDLY AFFORD A RETURN THE STRENGTH OF HER FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT EXPRESS THE NATURE OF THEM HOWEVER CONTENTED HER FRIEND THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING SUCH A SISTER WAS THEIR FIRST EFFUSION
MY NOTION OF THINGS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH LET ME ONLY HAVE THE GIRL I LIKE SAY I WITH A COMFORTABLE HOUSE OVER MY HEAD AND WHAT CARE I FOR ALL THE REST FORTUNE IS NOTHING I AM SURE OF A GOOD INCOME OF MY OWN
BUT FOR PARTICULARS ISABELLA COULD WELL AFFORD TO WAIT THE NEEDFUL WAS COMPRISED IN MISTER MORLAND'S PROMISE HIS HONOUR WAS PLEDGED TO MAKE EVERYTHING EASY AND BY WHAT MEANS THEIR INCOME WAS TO BE FORMED WHETHER LANDED PROPERTY WERE TO BE RESIGNED
AND HURRYING BACK TO THE HOTEL SWALLOWED THEIR DINNER IN HASTE TO PREVENT BEING IN THE DARK AND THEN HAD A DELIGHTFUL DRIVE BACK ONLY THE MOON WAS NOT UP AND IT RAINED A LITTLE AND MISTER MORLAND'S HORSE WAS SO TIRED HE COULD HARDLY GET IT ALONG
BUT WHAT WILL YOUR EXCELLENT FATHER AND MOTHER SAY OH HEAVENS WHEN I THINK OF THEM I AM SO AGITATED CATHERINE'S UNDERSTANDING BEGAN TO AWAKE AN IDEA OF THE TRUTH SUDDENLY DARTED INTO HER MIND AND
I DOUBT OUR BEING ABLE TO DO SO MUCH SAID MORLAND YOU CROAKING FELLOW CRIED THORPE WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO TEN TIMES MORE KINGSWESTON AYE AND BLAIZE CASTLE TOO AND ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN HEAR OF
A REVERIE SUCCEEDED THIS CONVICTION AND WHEN ISABELLA SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS TO RESOLVE ON THE QUALITY OF HER WEDDING GOWN THEIR CONFERENCE WAS PUT AN END TO BY THE ANXIOUS YOUNG LOVER HIMSELF WHO CAME TO BREATHE HIS PARTING SIGH BEFORE HE SET OFF FOR WILTSHIRE
AND IT IS NOT ONLY GOOD NATURE BUT YOU HAVE SO MUCH SO MUCH OF EVERYTHING AND THEN YOU HAVE SUCH UPON MY SOUL I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY LIKE YOU OH
WHAT IS IT REALLY A CASTLE AN OLD CASTLE THE OLDEST IN THE KINGDOM
THERE ARE NOT MANY THAT I KNOW MY OWN MIND ABOUT BY JOVE NO MORE DO I
IMPATIENT FOR THE REALIZATION OF ALL THAT HE HOPED AT HOME
THIS IS JUST THE TIME OF DAY FOR IT TO CLEAR UP AND I DO THINK IT LOOKS A LITTLE LIGHTER THERE IT IS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER TWELVE AND NOW I SHALL GIVE IT UP ENTIRELY OH THAT WE HAD SUCH WEATHER HERE AS THEY HAD AT UDOLPHO
THAT A BRIGHT AFTERNOON WOULD SUCCEED AND JUSTIFIED THE OPINION OF MISSUS ALLEN WHO HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD CLEAR UP BUT WHETHER CATHERINE MIGHT STILL EXPECT HER FRIENDS WHETHER THERE HAD NOT BEEN TOO MUCH RAIN FOR MISS TILNEY TO VENTURE MUST YET BE A QUESTION
OR FUNDED MONEY MADE OVER WAS A MATTER IN WHICH HER DISINTERESTED SPIRIT TOOK NO CONCERN SHE KNEW ENOUGH TO FEEL SECURE OF AN HONOURABLE AND SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT AND HER IMAGINATION TOOK A RAPID FLIGHT OVER ITS ATTENDANT FELICITIES
WELL PRAY DO NOT LET ANYBODY HERE BE A RESTRAINT ON YOU I DARE SAY WE COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT YOU BUT YOU MEN THINK YOURSELVES OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE CATHERINE COULD ALMOST HAVE ACCUSED ISABELLA OF BEING WANTING IN TENDERNESS TOWARDS HERSELF AND HER SORROWS
MAKE YOURSELF EASY THERE IS NO DANGER OF THAT FOR I HEARD TILNEY HALLOOING TO A MAN WHO WAS JUST PASSING BY ON HORSEBACK THAT THEY WERE GOING AS FAR AS WICK ROCKS THEN I WILL SHALL I GO MISSUS ALLEN
DIVIDED BETWEEN REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF ONE GREAT PLEASURE AND THE HOPE OF SOON ENJOYING ANOTHER ALMOST ITS EQUAL IN DEGREE HOWEVER UNLIKE IN KIND SHE COULD NOT THINK THE TILNEYS HAD ACTED QUITE WELL BY HER
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW VEXED I AM I SHALL HAVE NO PLEASURE AT CLIFTON NOR IN ANYTHING ELSE I HAD RATHER TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER GET OUT NOW AND WALK BACK TO THEM HOW COULD YOU SAY YOU SAW THEM DRIVING OUT IN A PHAETON THORPE DEFENDED HIMSELF VERY STOUTLY
BUT WHEN IT DID COME WHERE COULD DISTRESS BE FOUND I HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GAINING THE CONSENT OF MY KIND PARENTS AND AM PROMISED THAT EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER SHALL BE DONE TO FORWARD MY HAPPINESS WERE THE FIRST THREE LINES
BUT HERE IS YOUR SISTER SAYS SHE WILL NOT GO BLAIZE CASTLE CRIED CATHERINE WHAT IS THAT THE FINEST PLACE IN ENGLAND WORTH GOING FIFTY MILES AT ANY TIME TO SEE
AND INQUIRED FOR HER A FEW MINUTES AFTER HER SETTING OFF THAT WHEN HE TOLD THEM SHE WAS GONE OUT WITH MISTER THORPE THE LADY HAD ASKED WHETHER ANY MESSAGE HAD BEEN LEFT FOR HER AND ON HIS SAYING NO HAD FELT FOR A CARD BUT SAID SHE HAD NONE ABOUT HER AND WENT AWAY
IT IS VERY ODD BUT I SUPPOSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO DIRTY FOR A WALK AND WELL THEY MIGHT FOR I NEVER SAW SO MUCH DIRT IN MY LIFE WALK YOU COULD NO MORE WALK THAN YOU COULD FLY IT HAS NOT BEEN SO DIRTY THE WHOLE WINTER IT IS ANKLE DEEP EVERYWHERE
MAY WE GO UP EVERY STAIRCASE AND INTO EVERY SUITE OF ROOMS YES YES EVERY HOLE AND CORNER BUT THEN IF THEY SHOULD ONLY BE GONE OUT FOR AN HOUR TILL IT IS DRYER AND CALL BY AND BY
WITH THE NATURAL BLUSH OF SO NEW AN EMOTION SHE CRIED OUT GOOD HEAVEN MY DEAR ISABELLA WHAT DO YOU MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU REALLY BE IN LOVE WITH JAMES THIS BOLD SURMISE HOWEVER SHE SOON LEARNT COMPREHENDED BUT HALF THE FACT
THAT I QUITE DOTED ON YOU THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW YOU BUT SO IT ALWAYS IS WITH ME THE FIRST MOMENT SETTLES EVERYTHING THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT MORLAND CAME TO US LAST CHRISTMAS THE VERY FIRST MOMENT I BEHELD HIM MY HEART WAS IRRECOVERABLY GONE
BE MY ONLY CHOICE THIS CHARMING SENTIMENT RECOMMENDED AS MUCH BY SENSE AS NOVELTY GAVE CATHERINE A MOST PLEASING REMEMBRANCE OF ALL THE HEROINES OF HER ACQUAINTANCE AND SHE THOUGHT HER FRIEND NEVER LOOKED MORE LOVELY THAN IN UTTERING THE GRAND IDEA
A VERY GOOD EQUIVALENT FOR THE QUIET AND COUNTRY AIR OF AN INN AT CLIFTON HER SATISFACTION TOO IN NOT BEING AT THE LOWER ROOMS WAS SPOKEN MORE THAN ONCE HOW I PITY THE POOR CREATURES THAT ARE GOING THERE
DO YOU THAT'S HONEST BY HEAVENS I AM GLAD YOU ARE NO ENEMY TO MATRIMONY HOWEVER DID YOU EVER HEAR THE OLD SONG GOING TO ONE WEDDING BRINGS ON ANOTHER
THEY PROMISED TO COME AT TWELVE ONLY IT RAINED BUT NOW AS IT IS SO FINE I DARE SAY THEY WILL BE HERE SOON NOT THEY INDEED CRIED THORPE FOR AS WE TURNED INTO BROAD STREET I SAW THEM DOES HE NOT DRIVE A PHAETON WITH BRIGHT CHESTNUTS
AND AWAY SHE WENT IT WAS NOT IN THE POWER OF ALL HIS GALLANTRY TO DETAIN HER LONGER WITH SUCH NEWS TO COMMUNICATE AND SUCH A VISIT TO PREPARE FOR HER DEPARTURE WAS NOT TO BE DELAYED BY ANYTHING IN HIS NATURE TO URGE AND SHE HURRIED AWAY
AND NOW I MAY DISMISS MY HEROINE TO THE SLEEPLESS COUCH WHICH IS THE TRUE HEROINE'S PORTION TO A PILLOW STREWED WITH THORNS AND WET WITH TEARS
CATHERINE FELT THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN SAFER BUT ASHAMED OF AN IGNORANCE LITTLE EXPECTED SHE DARED NO LONGER CONTEST THE POINT NOR REFUSE TO HAVE BEEN AS FULL OF ARCH PENETRATION AND AFFECTIONATE SYMPATHY AS ISABELLA CHOSE TO CONSIDER HER
I AM COME TO BID YOU GOOD BYE CATHERINE WISHED HIM A GOOD JOURNEY WITHOUT APPEARING TO HEAR HER HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW FIDGETED ABOUT HUMMED A TUNE AND SEEMED WHOLLY SELF OCCUPIED
I DARE SAY IT WILL NOT BE A VERY GOOD BALL I KNOW THE MITCHELLS WILL NOT BE THERE I AM SURE I PITY EVERYBODY THAT IS BUT I DARE SAY MISTER MORLAND YOU LONG TO BE AT IT DO NOT YOU I AM SURE YOU DO
SAID HE SOON AFTERWARDS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE IT VERY WELL
ISABELLA CORROBORATED IT MY DEAREST CATHERINE YOU CANNOT FORM AN IDEA OF THE DIRT COME YOU MUST GO YOU CANNOT REFUSE GOING NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CASTLE BUT MAY WE GO ALL OVER IT
WERE NOT MORE THAN THAT BELOVED CHILD HAD NOW WELL EARNED JOHN HIMSELF WAS NO SKULKER IN JOY
AND A BRILLIANT EXHIBITION OF HOOP RINGS ON HER FINGER WHEN THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER WERE ASCERTAINED JOHN THORPE WHO HAD ONLY WAITED ITS ARRIVAL TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TO LONDON PREPARED TO SET OFF WELL MISS MORLAND
I KNOW BUT I WILL NOT PAIN YOU BY DESCRIBING MY ANXIETY YOU HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF IT I FEEL THAT I HAVE BETRAYED MYSELF PERPETUALLY SO UNGUARDED IN SPEAKING OF MY PARTIALITY FOR THE CHURCH BUT MY SECRET I WAS ALWAYS SURE WOULD BE SAFE WITH YOU
I DINE WITH MISS TILNEY TODAY AND MUST NOW BE GOING HOME NAY BUT THERE IS NO SUCH CONFOUNDED HURRY WHO KNOWS WHEN WE MAY BE TOGETHER AGAIN NOT BUT THAT I SHALL BE DOWN AGAIN BY THE END OF A FORTNIGHT
YOU WILL BE SO INFINITELY DEARER TO ME MY CATHERINE THAN EITHER ANNE OR MARIA I FEEL THAT I SHALL BE SO MUCH MORE ATTACHED TO MY DEAR MORLAND'S FAMILY THAN TO MY OWN THIS WAS A PITCH OF FRIENDSHIP BEYOND CATHERINE
THORPE TALKED TO HIS HORSE AND SHE MEDITATED BY TURNS ON BROKEN PROMISES AND BROKEN ARCHES PHAETONS AND FALSE HANGINGS TILNEYS AND TRAP DOORS AS THEY ENTERED ARGYLE BUILDINGS HOWEVER SHE WAS ROUSED BY THIS ADDRESS FROM HER COMPANION
AND ALL THAT THEY FELT ON THE OCCASION WAS COMPREHENDED IN A WISH FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS WITH A REMARK ON THE GENTLEMAN'S SIDE IN FAVOUR OF ISABELLA'S BEAUTY
I DO NOT KNOW INDEED YES I KNOW HE DOES I SAW HIM YOU ARE TALKING OF THE MAN YOU DANCED WITH LAST NIGHT ARE NOT YOU YES WELL I SAW HIM AT THAT MOMENT TURN UP THE LANSDOWN ROAD DRIVING A SMART LOOKING GIRL
WHO IS THAT GIRL WHO LOOKED AT YOU SO HARD AS SHE WENT BY WHO WHERE ON THE RIGHT HAND PAVEMENT SHE MUST BE ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT NOW CATHERINE LOOKED ROUND AND SAW MISS TILNEY LEANING ON HER BROTHER'S ARM
HOW COULD YOU DECEIVE ME SO MISTER THORPE HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW THEM DRIVING UP THE LANSDOWN ROAD I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD IT HAPPEN SO FOR THE WORLD THEY MUST THINK IT SO STRANGE SO RUDE OF ME TO GO BY THEM TOO WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
MARIA'S INTELLIGENCE CONCLUDED WITH A TENDER EFFUSION OF PITY FOR HER SISTER ANNE
EXHIBITING THE REMAINS OF MAGNIFICENT FURNITURE THOUGH NOW FOR MANY YEARS DESERTED THE HAPPINESS OF BEING STOPPED IN THEIR WAY ALONG NARROW WINDING VAULTS BY A LOW GRATED DOOR
IF I CAN BUT BE NEAR YOU I SHALL BE SATISFIED BUT THIS IS IDLE TALKING I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS TILL WE HAVE YOUR FATHER'S ANSWER MORLAND SAYS THAT BY SENDING IT TONIGHT TO SALISBURY WE MAY HAVE IT TOMORROW TOMORROW
IN SO READILY GIVING UP THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT SENDING HER ANY MESSAGE OF EXCUSE IT WAS NOW BUT AN HOUR LATER THAN THE TIME FIXED ON FOR THE BEGINNING OF THEIR WALK AND IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD OF THE PRODIGIOUS ACCUMULATION OF DIRT IN THE COURSE OF THAT HOUR
THERE GO GO I INSIST ON IT THE TWO FRIENDS WITH HEARTS NOW MORE UNITED THAN EVER WERE INSEPARABLE FOR THE DAY AND IN SCHEMES OF SISTERLY HAPPINESS THE HOURS FLEW ALONG MISSUS THORPE AND HER SON
CATHERINE'S COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LONGER WHAT IT HAD BEEN IN THEIR FORMER AIRING SHE LISTENED RELUCTANTLY AND HER REPLIES WERE SHORT BLAIZE CASTLE REMAINED HER ONLY COMFORT TOWARDS THAT SHE STILL LOOKED AT INTERVALS WITH PLEASURE
IT IS ALL ONE TO ME REPLIED THORPE RATHER ANGRILY AND INSTANTLY TURNING HIS HORSE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO BATH
THIS WAS OF COURSE VEHEMENTLY TALKED DOWN AS NO REASON AT ALL MISSUS ALLEN WAS CALLED ON TO SECOND HIM AND THE TWO OTHERS WALKED IN TO GIVE THEIR ASSISTANCE MY SWEETEST CATHERINE IS NOT THIS DELIGHTFUL WE SHALL HAVE A MOST HEAVENLY DRIVE
THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND IT STILL RAINED YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO MY DEAR I DO NOT QUITE DESPAIR YET I SHALL NOT GIVE IT UP TILL A QUARTER AFTER TWELVE
OH I AM IN SUCH ECSTASIES AT THE THOUGHTS OF A LITTLE COUNTRY AIR AND QUIET SO MUCH BETTER THAN GOING TO THE LOWER ROOMS WE SHALL DRIVE DIRECTLY TO CLIFTON AND DINE THERE
SHE SAW HERSELF AT THE END OF A FEW WEEKS THE GAZE AND ADMIRATION OF EVERY NEW ACQUAINTANCE AT FULLERTON THE ENVY OF EVERY VALUED OLD FRIEND IN PUTNEY WITH A CARRIAGE AT HER COMMAND A NEW NAME ON HER TICKETS
IT COMES ON FASTER AND FASTER SAID CATHERINE AS SHE STOOD WATCHING AT A WINDOW SO IT DOES INDEED IF IT KEEPS RAINING THE STREETS WILL BE VERY WET THERE ARE FOUR UMBRELLAS UP ALREADY HOW I HATE THE SIGHT OF AN UMBRELLA
HER BROTHER SHE FOUND WAS PREPARING TO SET OFF WITH ALL SPEED TO FULLERTON TO MAKE KNOWN HIS SITUATION AND ASK CONSENT AND HERE WAS A SOURCE OF SOME REAL AGITATION TO THE MIND OF ISABELLA CATHERINE ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HER AS SHE WAS HERSELF PERSUADED THAT
THAT NOBODY COULD IMAGINE HOW CHARMING IT HAD BEEN AND THAT IT HAD BEEN MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN ANYBODY COULD CONCEIVE SUCH WAS THE INFORMATION OF THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES THE SECOND UNFOLDED THUS MUCH IN DETAIL
AND THAT IF PEOPLE WHO ROLLED IN MONEY COULD NOT AFFORD THINGS HE DID NOT KNOW WHO COULD WHICH CATHERINE DID NOT EVEN ENDEAVOUR TO UNDERSTAND DISAPPOINTED OF WHAT WAS TO HAVE BEEN THE CONSOLATION FOR HER FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT
BUT TO WHAT PURPOSE DID SHE SPEAK THORPE ONLY LASHED HIS HORSE INTO A BRISKER TROT THE TILNEYS WHO HAD SOON CEASED TO LOOK AFTER HER WERE IN A MOMENT OUT OF SIGHT ROUND THE CORNER OF LAURA PLACE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS HERSELF WHISKED INTO THE MARKETPLACE
BUT I AM DETERMINED I WILL NOT BE CROSS IT IS NOT A LITTLE MATTER THAT PUTS ME OUT OF TEMPER ISABELLA NOW ENTERED THE ROOM WITH SO EAGER A STEP AND A LOOK OF SUCH HAPPY IMPORTANCE AS ENGAGED ALL HER FRIEND'S NOTICE
BUT KNEW NOT WHAT TO SAY AND HER ELOQUENCE WAS ONLY IN HER EYES FROM THEM HOWEVER THE EIGHT PARTS OF SPEECH SHONE OUT MOST EXPRESSIVELY
I HATE THE IDEA OF ONE GREAT FORTUNE LOOKING OUT FOR ANOTHER AND TO MARRY FOR MONEY I THINK THE WICKEDEST THING IN EXISTENCE GOOD DAY
DECLINED GIVING ANY ABSOLUTE PROMISE OF SUNSHINE SHE APPLIED TO MISSUS ALLEN AND MISSUS ALLEN'S OPINION WAS MORE POSITIVE SHE HAD NO DOUBT IN THE WORLD OF ITS BEING A VERY FINE DAY IF THE CLOUDS WOULD ONLY GO OFF AND THE SUN KEEP OUT
TO CATHERINE'S SIMPLE FEELINGS THIS ODD SORT OF RESERVE SEEMED NEITHER KINDLY MEANT NOR CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED AND ITS UNKINDNESS SHE WOULD HARDLY HAVE FORBORNE POINTING OUT HAD ITS INCONSISTENCY BEEN LESS THEIR FRIEND
THEY NEVER CAN CONSENT TO IT YOUR BROTHER WHO MIGHT MARRY ANYBODY HERE CATHERINE AGAIN DISCERNED THE FORCE OF LOVE INDEED ISABELLA YOU ARE TOO HUMBLE THE DIFFERENCE OF FORTUNE CAN BE NOTHING TO SIGNIFY OH
SO VERY LITTLE DID THEY APPEAR TO DWELL ON HER MIND AND SO VERY INADEQUATE WAS THE COMFORT SHE OFFERED DO NOT BE SO DULL MY DEAREST CREATURE SHE WHISPERED YOU WILL QUITE BREAK MY HEART IT WAS AMAZINGLY SHOCKING TO BE SURE
I REMEMBER I WORE MY YELLOW GOWN WITH MY HAIR DONE UP IN BRAIDS AND WHEN I CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND JOHN INTRODUCED HIM I THOUGHT I NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO HANDSOME BEFORE HERE
STILL HOWEVER AND DURING THE LENGTH OF ANOTHER STREET SHE ENTREATED HIM TO STOP PRAY PRAY STOP MISTER THORPE I CANNOT GO ON I WILL NOT GO ON I MUST GO BACK TO MISS TILNEY BUT MISTER THORPE ONLY LAUGHED SMACKED HIS WHIP
HER HEART WAS OVERFLOWING WITH TENDERNESS IT WAS DEAR JOHN AND DEAR CATHERINE AT EVERY WORD DEAR ANNE AND DEAR MARIA MUST IMMEDIATELY BE MADE SHARERS IN THEIR FELICITY AND TWO DEARS AT ONCE BEFORE THE NAME OF ISABELLA
MY FATHER AND MOTHER WILL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AND I HOPE I HOPE MISS MORLAND YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY TO SEE ME OH DEAR NOT AT ALL
AND IN TWO MINUTES THEY WERE OFF CATHERINE'S FEELINGS AS SHE GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE
AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK HOWEVER A FEW SPECKS OF SMALL RAIN UPON THE WINDOWS CAUGHT CATHERINE'S WATCHFUL EYE AND OH DEAR I DO BELIEVE IT WILL BE WET BROKE FROM HER IN A MOST DESPONDING TONE
IT WAS TOO DIRTY FOR MISSUS ALLEN TO ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND TO THE PUMP ROOM HE ACCORDINGLY SET OFF BY HIMSELF AND CATHERINE HAD BARELY WATCHED HIM DOWN THE STREET WHEN HER NOTICE WAS CLAIMED BY THE APPROACH OF THE SAME TWO OPEN CARRIAGES
BUT SWORE OFF MANY SENTENCES IN HIS PRAISE THE LETTER WHENCE SPRANG ALL THIS FELICITY WAS SHORT CONTAINING LITTLE MORE THAN THIS ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS AND EVERY PARTICULAR WAS DEFERRED TILL JAMES COULD WRITE AGAIN
THOUGH RATHER THAN BE DISAPPOINTED OF THE PROMISED WALK AND ESPECIALLY RATHER THAN BE THOUGHT ILL OF BY THE TILNEYS SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GIVEN UP ALL THE HAPPINESS WHICH ITS WALLS COULD SUPPLY THE HAPPINESS OF A PROGRESS THROUGH A LONG SUITE OF LOFTY ROOMS
SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW HOW COULD I HELP IT JOHN WOULD HAVE ME GO FOR HE VOWED HE WOULD NOT DRIVE HER BECAUSE SHE HAD SUCH THICK ANKLES I DARE SAY SHE WILL NOT BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AGAIN THIS MONTH
SPARE ME THE ANNOYANCES TO WHICH THE STRANGENESS OF OUR MUTUAL POSITION MIGHT GIVE RISE TO OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHERS I AM NEITHER WHIMSICAL NOR PRUDISH AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO GET THAT REPUTATION
THE LOVE WHICH IS MY PRIDE AND WHENCE I HAVE DRAWN AS FROM A MAGIC FOUNTAIN FRESH LIFE
WHICH MY CHILDISH EYES USED TO SEE WITHOUT COMPREHENDING A FORTNIGHT AFTER MY ARRIVAL MY FATHER AND MOTHER TOOK ME ALONG WITH MY TWO BROTHERS TO DINE WITH ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS
OCTOBER HOW DEEPLY YOUR LETTER MOVED ME ABOVE ALL WHEN I COMPARE OUR WIDELY DIFFERENT DESTINIES HOW BRILLIANT IS THE WORLD YOU ARE ENTERING HOW PEACEFUL THE RETREAT WHERE I SHALL END MY MODEST CAREER
HAVING GOT AN INCH TO ASK FOR AN ELL AND YOU AND I SWEET LOVE ARE OF THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE IT ALL I WATCHED LOUIS OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE AND PUT IT TO MYSELF HAS SUFFERING HAD A SOFTENING OR A HARDENING EFFECT ON HIM
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESE THREE OBVIOUS DRAWBACKS MADE HIM DISTRUSTFUL OF HIMSELF HE DOUBTED HIS POWER TO MAKE ME HAPPY AND GUESSED THAT HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS
THANKS TO AN IRON RAILING AT THE ENTRANCE FACING THE ROAD THIS SIMPLE FARM HAS A CERTAIN AIR OF BEING A COUNTRY SEAT
WITH MAGIC TOUCH I HAVE EFFACED THE VERY MEMORY OF HIS SUFFERINGS IT IS A COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS LOUIS IS REALLY VERY ATTRACTIVE NOW FEELING SURE OF MY AFFECTION HE THROWS OFF HIS RESERVE AND DISPLAYS UNSUSPECTED GIFTS
WHICH WAS SERVED TO US ON OLD SILVER DISHES BLACKENED AND BATTERED THE EXILE MY DARLING PET IS LIKE THE RAILING EMACIATED HE IS PALE AND SILENT AND BEARS TRACES OF SUFFERING AT THIRTY SEVEN HE MIGHT BE FIFTY
SHALL BE ALWAYS GREEN I SHALL CARRY MY PARK UP THE HILLSIDE AND PLANT ON THE HIGHEST POINT SOME PRETTY KIOSQUE WHENCE PERHAPS MY EYES MAY CATCH THE SHIMMER OF THE MEDITERRANEAN ORANGE AND LEMON TREES AND ALL CHOICEST THINGS THAT GROW
BY DINT OF CONSTANT WATCHING I DISCOVERED HOW HIS MIND AND COUNTENANCE HARMONIZE THE ANIMAL THAT WE CALL A HUSBAND TO QUOTE YOUR WORDS DISAPPEARED AND ONE BALMY EVENING I DISCOVERED IN HIS STEAD A LOVER
MY FATHER AND MOTHER ENTERED INTO THEIR NEIGHBOR'S IDEA WITH AN EYE TO MY INTERESTS SO SOON AS THEY DISCOVERED THAT RENEE DE MAUCOMBE WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE WITHOUT A DOWRY AND THAT THE MONEY THE SAID RENEE OUGHT TO INHERIT FROM HER PARENTS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GIRL AND A MARRIED WOMAN IS SO VAST THAT THE GIRL CAN NO MORE COMPREHEND IT THAN THE MARRIED WOMAN CAN GO BACK TO GIRLHOOD AGAIN
I FOUND MY ROOM ALMOST EXACTLY AS I LEFT IT
THE BARON A VERY PIOUS OLD MAN PRACTISED THAT FINE THEOLOGICAL VIRTUE WHICH WE USED TO CULTIVATE AT BLOIS HOPE
SUCH IS YOUR FRIEND'S SPLENDID TITLE
SECURE OF MY FREEDOM I WAS ABLE TO THROW MYSELF GAILY INTO THE PETTY DETAILS WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANY A CEREMONY OF THE KIND AND TO BE MY NATURAL SELF PERHAPS I MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR AN OLD BIRD AS THEY SAY AT BLOIS
WHEN YOU ARE MARRIED YOU WILL APPROVE THIS RESERVE ENOUGH THAT NOTHING WAS LACKING EITHER OF SATISFACTION FOR THE MOST FASTIDIOUS SENTIMENT OR OF THAT UNEXPECTEDNESS WHICH BRINGS IN A SENSE ITS OWN SANCTION
I CAN'T TELL YOU ALL MY REASONS FOR THIS TO YOU ALONE SHALL I CONFIDE EVEN AS MUCH AS THIS I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN WHETHER PASSIONATELY LOVED OR NOT LOSE MUCH IN THEIR RELATION WITH THEIR HUSBANDS BY NOT CONCEALING THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT MARRIAGE AND THE WAY THEY LOOK AT IT
WHICH ARE YOURS ALSO IN PERFECTION STILL LET ME SAY THAT THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING YOUR UNCHANGING BEAUTY ON WHICH TO FEAST MY EYES GIVES ME A JOY THAT GROWS WITH EVERY GLANCE THERE IS A GRACE AND DIGNITY IN THE LINES OF YOUR FACE
ON THE OTHER HAND MARRIAGE WILL REMAIN WHEN PLEASURES HAVE VANISHED AND IT IS THE SOURCE OF INTERESTS FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN THOSE OF THE MAN AND WOMAN ENTERING ON THE ALLIANCE MIGHT IT NOT THEREFORE BE THAT THE ONLY REQUISITE FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE WAS FRIENDSHIP
INFUSE WITH PASSION THEN IF YOU WILL THIS FRIENDSHIP AND LET THE VOICE OF LOVE DISTURB ITS CALM ON MY PART I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO BRING MY FEELINGS INTO ACCORD WITH YOURS ONE THING ABOVE ALL I WOULD BEG OF YOU
EVERY WITCHERY OF IMAGINATION OF PASSION OF RELUCTANCE OVERCOME OF THE IDEAL PASSING INTO REALITY PLAYED ITS PART YET IN SPITE OF ALL THIS ENCHANTMENT I ONCE MORE STOOD OUT FOR MY COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE
BUT ABOVE ALL I HAVE INSISTED ON THE GREATEST SECRECY IN REGARD TO OUR DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS A HUSBAND WHO SUBMITS TO HIS WIFE'S YOKE IS JUSTLY HELD AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE A WOMAN'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE ENTIRELY CONCEALED
I HAVE VOWED TO MYSELF TO COMFORT THIS YOUNG MAN WHO HAS NEVER KNOWN YOUTH BUT PASSED STRAIGHT FROM HIS MOTHER'S ARMS TO THE EMBRACE OF WAR AND FROM THE JOYS OF HIS COUNTRY HOME TO THE FROSTS AND FORCED LABOR OF SIBERIA
AND OBTAINING FOR IT THE MAXIMUM OF PLEASURE WITH THE MINIMUM OF COST I HAVE ALREADY CONVINCED LOUIS OF THE NECESSITY OF GETTING ROADS MADE IN ORDER THAT HE MAY EARN THE REPUTATION OF A MAN INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF HIS DISTRICT
SO HERE ARE MY BLACK HAIR AND MY BLACK EYES WHOSE LASHES ACT ACCORDING TO YOU LIKE VENETIAN BLINDS MY COMMANDING AIR AND MY WHOLE PERSON RAISED TO THE RANK OF SOVEREIGN POWER TEN YEARS HENCE DEAR
A CODE WHICH WILL DRIVE AS MANY GIRLS OF GOOD FAMILY INTO CONVENTS AS IT WILL FIND HUSBANDS FOR THE FRENCH NOBILITY FROM THE LITTLE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER SEEM TO BE DIVIDED ON THESE MATTERS THE DINNER DARLING
RAISED IN HIS NURSERY WITH A SPECIAL VIEW TO THIS ACQUISITION THE BARON HAVING FOUND HIS LONG LOST SON HAS NOW BUT ONE THOUGHT TO MARRY HIM AND MARRY HIM TO A GIRL OF GOOD FAMILY
AND TRY TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT THE SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT I WAS UNDERTAKING FILLED ME AT FIRST WITH TERROR MARRIAGE IS A MATTER CONCERNING THE WHOLE OF LIFE WHILST LOVE AIMS ONLY AT PLEASURE
YET LOUIS IS LOVABLE HIS TEMPER IS WONDERFULLY EVEN AND HE PERFORMS AS A MATTER OF COURSE ACTS ON WHICH MOST MEN WOULD PLUME THEMSELVES IN SHORT IF I DO NOT LOVE HIM I SHALL FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN BEING GOOD TO HIM
PERHAPS SOME DAY THE COUNTRY DAME MAY GO AND SPEND A WINTER IN MARSEILLES BUT DANGER DOES NOT HAUNT THE PURLIEUS OF A NARROW PROVINCIAL STAGE THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO FEAR NOT EVEN AN ADMIRATION SUCH AS COULD ONLY MAKE A WOMAN PROUD
SO YOU MUST NARRATE TO ME IN FULL ALL YOUR ADVENTURES DESCRIBE YOUR BALLS AND PARTIES TELL ME WHAT YOU WEAR WHAT FLOWERS CROWN YOUR LOVELY GOLDEN LOCKS AND WHAT ARE THE WORDS AND MANNERS OF THE MEN YOU MEET
WE SAT FIVE IN THE ANTIQUATED CARRIAGE AND ARRIVED IN STATE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK THE DINNER WAS FOR THREE AT THE GRANGE WHICH IS THE DWELLING OF THE BARON DE L'ESTORADE MY FATHER IN LAW TO BE HAS YOU SEE NO CASTLE
I LONG FOR THE DAY WHICH SHALL MAKE YOU A MOTHER THAT I MAY SEE YOU CONTENT WITH THE FULNESS OF YOUR LIFE MAY HEAR YOU IN THE SWEET VOICE I LOVE AND WITH THE THOUGHTS BLESS THE LOVE WHICH HAS REFRESHED MY SOUL AND GIVEN NEW VIGOR TO MY POWERS
I SHALL TAKE A LEADING PART IN THE PUBLIC LIFE OF THE DISTRICT AND ON YOU SHALL FALL THE RAYS OF A GLORY WHICH WILL OWE ITS EXISTENCE TO THE DESIRE OF PLEASING YOU SO MUCH FOR MY PUPIL DEAR DO YOU SUPPOSE HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN LIKE THIS BEFORE
WHY SHOULD WE NOT BOTH BE LAUGHING AND GAY IN YOUR PARIS WHENCE I SHALL CARRY YOU OFF NOW AND AGAIN TO MY BEAUTIFUL OASIS IN PROVENCE OH LOUISE DON'T SPOIL THE SPLENDID FUTURE WHICH AWAITS US BOTH DON'T DO THE MAD THINGS WITH WHICH YOU THREATEN ME
A YEAR HENCE HIS STYLE WILL HAVE STILL FURTHER IMPROVED LOUIS IS NOW IN HIS FIRST TRANSPORT WHAT I LOOK FORWARD TO IS THE UNIFORM AND CONTINUOUS SENSATION OF CONTENT WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE FRUIT OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE
I INSIST TOO ON HIS STUDYING A GREAT DEAL BEFORE LONG I HOPE TO SEE HIM A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF MY FAMILY AND HIS MOTHER'S I HAVE TOLD HIM PLAINLY THAT I AM AMBITIOUS
OH OUR DEFERENCE AND PROPRIETY ARE QUITE DISQUIETING I ASSURE YOU THERE I AM OFF AGAIN GOOD BYE DEAR P S I HAVE JUST OPENED YOUR THIRD LETTER
A LOOK OF YOUTH THE GREATER REFINEMENT WHICH I INTRODUCED INTO THE HOUSE WAS REFLECTED IN HIS PERSON INSENSIBLY I BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO HIS PRESENCE AND MADE ANOTHER SELF OF HIM
SHALL EMBELLISH MY RETREAT AND THERE WILL I BE A MOTHER AMONG MY CHILDREN THE POETRY OF NATURE WHICH NOTHING CAN DESTROY SHALL HEDGE US ROUND AND STANDING LOYALLY AT THE POST OF DUTY WE NEED FEAR NO DANGER
HUMBLE COUNTRY PLEASURES WILL ENLIVEN THE MONOTONY OF MY FUTURE IT SHALL BE MY AMBITION TO ENLARGE THE OASIS ROUND MY HOUSE AND TO GIVE IT THE LORDLY SHADE OF FINE TREES
MY HAPPINESS WOULD WOUND HIM AND HAS TO BE CONCEALED HE IS SENSITIVE AS A WOMAN LIKE ALL MEN WHO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH FOR THREE MONTHS WE REMAINED AS WE WERE BEFORE MARRIAGE AS YOU MAY IMAGINE
YOU ARE SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL RENEE AND YOUR BEAUTY IS OF THE STATUESQUE AND REGAL TYPE ON WHICH TIME LEAVES BUT LITTLE IMPRESSION NO DOUBT THE LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DEPENDS LESS ON OUTWARD BEAUTY THAN ON GRACES OF CHARACTER
EVEN THE OLD MAN WOULD NOT BE A BLOT UPON MY PRETTY HOME AND HAS BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO LINE WITH ALL MY IMPROVEMENTS TO PLEASE ME HE HAS ADOPTED THE DRESS AND WITH THE DRESS THE MANNERS OF THE DAY WE HAVE ENGLISH HORSES
IN A COUNTRY LIFE SUCH AS OURS WILL BE OUGHT WE NOT TO BEAR IN MIND THE EVANESCENT NATURE OF PASSION IS IT NOT SIMPLE PRUDENCE TO MAKE PROVISION BEFOREHAND AGAINST THE CALAMITIES INCIDENT TO CHANGE OF FEELING
BITTERLY ASHAMED I STRUGGLED WITH MYSELF ALAS WHEN PRIDE IS THE ONLY MOTIVE FOR RESISTANCE EXCUSES FOR CAPITULATION ARE SOON FOUND WE CELEBRATED OUR UNION IN SECRET AND SECRET IT MUST REMAIN BETWEEN US
AND BEFORE LONG IT BECAME CLEAR THAT CHANCE HAD GIVEN ME FOR ADVERSARY ONE WHO WAS THE LESS FITTED FOR THE CONTEST BECAUSE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU MAGNILOQUENTLY CALL MY GREATNESS OF SOUL BROKEN BY SUFFERINGS AND MISFORTUNE
YOUR FAVORS TO ME HOWEVER SLIGHT WILL ALWAYS MAKE MY HAPPINESS IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE AS NOW FOR I AM SENSIBLE HOW MUCH DIGNITY THERE IS IN OUR PROMISE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER'S LIBERTY
THE FAVOR I AM ABOUT TO ASK FROM YOU WILL DEMAND UNSELFISHNESS ON YOUR PART FAR NOBLER THAN THE SERVITUDE TO WHICH A MAN'S LOVE WHEN SINCERE IS SUPPOSED TO REDUCE HIM THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU RISE TO THE HEIGHT OF FRIENDSHIP SUCH AS I UNDERSTAND IT
LIFE GIVES US BUT ONE FRIEND AND I WISH TO BE YOURS FRIENDSHIP IS THE BOND BETWEEN A PAIR OF KINDRED SOULS UNITED IN THEIR STRENGTH AND YET INDEPENDENT LET US BE FRIENDS AND COMRADES TO BEAR JOINTLY THE BURDEN OF LIFE
RETAINING PERFECT INDEPENDENCE WHAT COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE MORE HONORABLE A CONTRACT OF THIS KIND DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE LEGAL CONTRACT AND EVEN TO THE SACRAMENT ITSELF COULD BE CONCLUDED ONLY BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
WHOM THE FATHER INTERVIEWED IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN DECLARED THAT HE HAD SEEN HIM TAKEN BY THE RUSSIANS
A FRIENDSHIP WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF THESE ADVANTAGES WOULD SHUT ITS EYES TO MANY OF THE IMPERFECTIONS OF HUMANITY NOW THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXISTENCE OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MYSELF AND LOUIS DE L'ESTORADE
WHOSE WORDS THRILLED ME AND ON WHOSE ARM I LEANT WITH PLEASURE BEYOND WORDS IN SHORT TO BE OPEN WITH YOU AS I WOULD BE WITH GOD BEFORE WHOM CONCEALMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE THE PERFECT LOYALTY WITH WHICH HE HAD KEPT HIS OATH MAY HAVE PIQUED ME
BUILT OF BIG ROUND PEBBLES SET IN LAYERS ALTERNATELY SLOPING OR UPRIGHT ACCORDING TO THE ARTISTIC TASTE OF THE MASON WHICH FINDS HERE ITS ONLY OUTLET THE MUD IN WHICH THEY ARE SET IS FALLING AWAY IN PLACES
OLD GENTLEMAN OF GOOD FAMILY WHO HAS MADE HIMSELF RICH AFTER THE PROVINCIAL FASHION BY SCRAPING AND PARING
TO BE THE UNCEASING SPRING OF HAPPINESS FOR A MAN WHO KNOWS IT AND ADDS GRATITUDE TO LOVE AH DEAR ONE THIS IS A CONVICTION WHICH FORTIFIES THE SOUL EVEN MORE THAN THE MOST PASSIONATE LOVE CAN DO
HIS FINE BLUE EYES ARE CAVERNOUS HE IS A LITTLE DEAF WHICH SUGGESTS THE KNIGHT OF THE SORROWFUL COUNTENANCE
IN THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE
IN THIS TASK TOWARDS WHICH MY EVERY ENERGY SHALL BE BENT WHILE IT REMAINS CONCEALED FROM ALL BUT GOD AND YOU I AM VERY NEARLY HAPPY NOW BUT SHOULD I BE SO WITHOUT A FRIENDLY HEART IN WHICH TO POUR THE CONFESSION FOR HOW MAKE A CONFIDANT OF HIM
HE WAS GREATLY ASTONISHED TO FIND ME AT ONCE SO REASONABLE AND SO APT AT REASONING BUT HE MADE ME A SOLEMN PROMISE AFTER WHICH I TOOK HIS HAND AND PRESSED IT AFFECTIONATELY WE WERE MARRIED AT THE END OF THE WEEK
AND TO QUEEN IT IN PARIS YOUR POOR LITTLE SWEETHEART RENEE THAT CHILD OF THE DESERT HAS FALLEN FROM THE EMPYREAN WHITHER TOGETHER WE HAD SOARED INTO THE VULGAR REALITIES OF A LIFE AS HOMELY AS A DAISY'S
BUT ONLY ON THE EXPRESS CONDITION OF BEING ALLOWED TO WORK MY WILL UPON THE GRANGE AND MAKE A PARK THERE I HAVE DEMANDED FROM MY FATHER IN SET TERMS A GRANT OF WATER WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT THITHER FROM MAUCOMBE
BY DINT OF CLOSE STUDY I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS LOVE AMOUNTED TO A PASSION ONCE TRANSFORMED INTO AN IDOL WHOSE SLIGHTEST FROWN WOULD TURN HIM WHITE AND TREMBLING I REALIZED THAT I MIGHT VENTURE ANYTHING
THE IMPORTANT POINT OF SEPARATING MARRIAGE FROM MARITAL RIGHTS WAS SETTLED IN A CONVERSATION BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE GAVE PROOF OF AN EXCELLENT TEMPER AND A TENDER HEART
DEAR THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH WOULD BESET MY LIFE HAD APPEARED TO ME CLEARLY AS IN A VISION AND I WAS SINCERELY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF THE MAN I MARRIED NOW IN THE SOLITUDE OF A LIFE LIKE OURS
AND MY CHILDREN IF I HAVE ANY WILL NOT BE RENT FROM ME THEY WILL BE MINE TO TRAIN AND MAKE MEN OF THE JOY OF MY LIFE IF YOU ALSO ARE TRUE TO YOUR DESTINY
OUR OWN IMPULSE SHALL WITH US ALONE DICTATE THE EXPRESSION OF FEELING WE SHALL BE FREE EVEN IN OUR FETTERS I SHALL HAVE THE MORE PRIDE IN WOOING YOU AGAIN NOW THAT I KNOW THE REWARD YOU PLACE ON VICTORY YOU CANNOT SPEAK BREATHE
THIS DIFFICULTY THE FIRST WHICH HAS ARISEN IS THE ONLY ONE WHICH HAS DELAYED THE COMPLETION OF OUR MARRIAGE ALTHOUGH AT FIRST I MAY HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO ACCEPT ANYTHING RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT IT IS ONLY IN HUMAN NATURE
LEAVE ME ABSOLUTELY FREE I WOULD PUT NO HINDRANCE IN THE WAY OF YOUR INSPIRING ME WITH A LOVE SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN BUT I AM DETERMINED TO BE YOURS ONLY OF MY OWN FREE GIFT CREATE IN ME THE WISH TO GIVE UP MY FREEDOM
A FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS LEADS TO THE DOOR WHICH IS PROTECTED BY A PENT HOUSE ROOF
WAS A FIRST MEETING BETWEEN YOUR SWEETHEART AND THE EXILE THE COMTE DE MAUCOMBE'S SERVANTS DONNED THEIR OLD LACED LIVERIES AND HATS THE COACHMAN HIS GREAT TOP BOOTS
NOT COUNTING HOUSE AND LANDS QUITE A CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE IN PROVENCE HIS WORTHY FATHER HAD BOUGHT ON THE VERY EVE OF THE CHEVALIER'S RETURN A FINE BUT BADLY MANAGED ESTATE WHERE HE DESIGNS TO PLANT TEN THOUSAND MULBERRY TREES
AND ROOFED WITH HOLLOW TILES OF A GOOD RED CONSTITUTE THE GRANGE THE RAFTERS BEND UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THIS BRICK KILN THE WINDOWS INSERTED CASUALLY WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT SYMMETRY HAVE ENORMOUS SHUTTERS PAINTED YELLOW
FOR DEAR I HAVE MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION AFTER THE SNOWS OF SIBERIA A MAN IS READY ENOUGH TO SEE MERIT IN THOSE BLACK EYES WHICH ACCORDING TO YOU USED TO RIPEN FRUIT WITH A LOOK
AFTER SUCCESSFULLY ELUDING THE CONSCRIPTION HE WAS FORCED TO SEND HIM TO THE ARMY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN TO JOIN THE EMPEROR'S BODYGUARD AFTER LEIPSIC NO MORE WAS HEARD OF HIM
WITH THE ADDITION OF THE FATHER'S SAVINGS
MY ONE JOY AND IT IS SUPREME SPRINGS FROM THE CERTAINTY OF HAVING BROUGHT NEW LIFE TO MY HUSBAND BEFORE I HAVE BORNE HIM ANY CHILDREN LOUIS HAS REGAINED HIS YOUTH STRENGTH AND SPIRITS HE IS NOT THE SAME MAN
THE WHOLE STORY OF MY LIFE LIES BEFORE ME NOW ITS GREAT CRISES WILL BE THE TEETHING AND NUTRITION OF THE YOUNG MASTERS DE L'ESTORADE AND THE MISCHIEF THEY DO TO MY SHRUBS AND ME TO EMBROIDER THEIR CAPS
WILL HE FIND OUT THERE ARE TWO I AM WRITING NONSENSE NOW AND AS HENCEFORTH I CAN ONLY BE FOOLISH BY PROXY I HAD BETTER STOP ONE KISS THEN ON EACH CHEEK MY LIPS ARE STILL VIRGINAL HE HAS ONLY DARED TO TAKE MY HAND
ONLY A SIMPLE COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING BENEATH ONE OF OUR HILLS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THAT NOBLE VALLEY THE PRIDE OF WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE THE BUILDING IS QUITE UNPRETENTIOUS FOUR PEBBLE WALLS COVERED WITH A YELLOWISH WASH
RATHER THAN RETURN TO THE CONVENT THAT AT LEAST IS PLAIN SO SOON AS I REALIZED THAT THE CONVENT WAS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO MARRYING LOUIS I HAD AS GIRLS SAY TO SUBMIT
HAVING RENOUNCED ALL IDEA OF FINDING IN MARRIAGE THOSE TRANSPORTS OF LOVE ON WHICH OUR MINDS USED SO OFTEN AND WITH SUCH PERILOUS RAPTURE TO DWELL I FOUND A GENTLE CALM SETTLING OVER ME IF DEBARRED FROM LOVE
WHAT GRATITUDE COULD YOU FEEL TO ME LATER FOR A GIFT IN WHICH MY GOODWILL COUNTED FOR NOTHING IF DURING THE TIME THAT I REMAINED INDIFFERENT TO YOU YIELDING ONLY A PASSIVE OBEDIENCE SUCH AS MY MOTHER HAS JUST BEEN URGING ON ME A CHILD WERE BORN TO US
THAT LOUIS HAS SINCE CONFESSED TO ME THE ALARM IT CAUSED HIM TO FIND IN ME SO LITTLE OF THE IGNORANT MAIDEN THEN I LISTENED TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN REPLY HE GOT MIXED UP IN HIS ARGUMENTS AS PEOPLE DO WHEN HANDICAPPED BY FEAR
ACT OR THINK WITHOUT ADDING TO THE ADMIRATION I FEEL FOR YOUR CHARM BOTH OF BODY AND MIND THERE IS IN YOU A RARE COMBINATION OF THE IDEAL THE PRACTICAL AND THE BEWITCHING WHICH SATISFIES ALIKE JUDGMENT A HUSBAND'S PRIDE DESIRE AND HOPE
AND THAT I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED HIS FATHER SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOOK AFTER THE ESTATE AND PRACTISE ECONOMIES BECAUSE I WISHED HIM TO DEVOTE HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO POLITICS IF WE HAD CHILDREN I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM ALL PROSPEROUS AND WITH GOOD STATE APPOINTMENTS
YOU SEE THAT HE FANCIES HIMSELF VANITY OF MEN THE CHOSEN OF MY HEART JUST AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO LEGAL BONDS NEVERTHELESS I HAVE NOT YET GOT BEYOND THAT EXTERNAL ATTRACTION WHICH GIVES US STRENGTH TO PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL
WHY NOT SEEK FOR HAPPINESS I SAID TO MYSELF MOREOVER I AM LOVED AND THE LOVE OFFERED ME I SHALL ACCEPT MY MARRIED LIFE WILL BE NO SLAVERY BUT RATHER A PERPETUAL REIGN
ONE EVENING HE TENTATIVELY SUGGESTED THAT I ONLY MARRIED HIM TO ESCAPE THE CONVENT I CANNOT DENY IT WAS MY GRAVE REPLY MY DEAR IT TOUCHED ME TO THE HEART TO SEE THE TWO GREAT TEARS WHICH STOOD IN HIS EYES
IN THE NEXT PLACE HE SHARES OUR VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF MY BEAUTY AND IT IS CRUEL FOR HIM TO SEE HOW THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS LIFE HAVE ROBBED HIM OF YOUTH FINALLY HE FELT THE SUPERIORITY OF MY WOMANHOOD OVER HIS MANHOOD
THE FORCE THUS DEVELOPED AT ONCE IMPETUOUS AND ENDURING SIMPLE AND DIVERSIFIED BRINGS FORTH ULTIMATELY THE FAMILY THAT NOBLE PRODUCT OF WOMANHOOD WHICH I REALIZE NOW IN ALL ITS ANIMATING BEAUTY
THAT HE WILL LEAVE THE REINS IN HIS WIFE'S HANDS AND AS I SHALL DO NOTHING TO REMIND HIM OF THIS WISE RESOLVE IT IS LIKELY HE MAY PERSEVERE IN IT YOU MY DEAR LOUISE WILL SUPPLY THE ROMANCE OF MY LIFE
AT LAST IT DAWNED UPON ME THAT THE UNEXPECTED RETURN OF THIS SON WAS THE CAUSE OF MY OWN WHO COULD HAVE IMAGINED WHILST FANCY WAS LEADING US A GIDDY DANCE
WE SHALL TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN THE SILKWORMS FOR WHOSE BENEFIT OUR MULBERRY LEAVES WILL BE SOLD WE SHALL KNOW THE STRANGE VICISSITUDES OF LIFE IN PROVENCE AND THE STORMS THAT MAY ATTACK EVEN A PEACEFUL HOUSEHOLD
DO NOT FANCY I CONCLUDED THAT I ASK THIS FROM ANY WISH TO BE ECCENTRIC IT IS THE GREAT DESIRE I HAVE FOR YOUR RESPECT WHICH PROMPTS MY REQUEST IF YOU OWE THE CROWN OF YOUR LOVE MERELY TO THE LEGAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY
THAT MY DESTINED HUSBAND WAS SLOWLY TRAVELING ON FOOT THROUGH RUSSIA POLAND AND GERMANY HIS BAD LUCK ONLY FORSOOK HIM AT BERLIN WHERE THE FRENCH MINISTER HELPED HIS RETURN TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
I DREW HIM ASIDE IN THE MOST NATURAL MANNER ON SOLITARY WALKS DURING WHICH I DISCREETLY SOUNDED HIS FEELINGS I MADE HIM TALK AND GOT HIM TO EXPOUND TO ME HIS IDEAS AND PLANS FOR OUR FUTURE MY QUESTIONS BETRAYED SO MANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
LA CRAMPADE FEBRUARY MY DEAR LOUISE I WAS BOUND TO WAIT SOME TIME BEFORE WRITING TO YOU BUT NOW I KNOW OR RATHER I HAVE LEARNED MANY THINGS WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR FUTURE HAPPINESS I MUST TELL YOU
AND INVEST HER WITH AN EXHAUSTLESS POWER A REDUNDANCY OF LIFE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING BLOSSOM AROUND HER THE MORE SHE IS MISTRESS OF HERSELF THE MORE CERTAINLY WILL THE LOVE AND HAPPINESS SHE CREATES BE FIT TO WEATHER THE STORMS OF LIFE
A PROVENCAL LAD AND THE OLD WOMAN WHO USED TO WAIT ON HIS WIFE THE ROOMS ARE SCANTILY FURNISHED NEVERTHELESS THE HOUSE OF L'ESTORADE HAD DONE ITS BEST THE CUPBOARDS HAD BEEN RANSACKED AND ITS LAST MAN BEATEN UP FOR THE DINNER
MARRIAGE SOON BECOMES INTOLERABLE UNLESS THE WOMAN IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT A WOMAN IN SUCH A CASE NEEDS THE CHARM OF A MISTRESS COMBINED WITH THE SOLID QUALITIES OF A WIFE
YOU WHO OUGHT TO FIND YOUR MATE AMONGST THE GREAT ONES OF THE EARTH THE CHILDREN OF YOUR RENEE WILL NOT LACK A ZEALOUS PROTECTRESS FAREWELL THEN FOR ME AT LEAST TO THE ROMANCES AND THRILLING ADVENTURES IN WHICH WE USED OURSELVES TO PLAY THE PART OF HEROINE
HE HOARDED HIS INCOME FOR HIM AND GUARDED CAREFULLY THE PORTION OF INHERITANCE WHICH FELL TO HIM
AH MY LOVE BY THE ARDOR WITH WHICH HE EMBRACED MY PLANS I CAN GAUGE THE DEPTH OF HIS AFFECTION TO CONCLUDE HERE IS A LETTER HE WROTE ME YESTERDAY FROM MARSEILLES WHERE HE HAD GONE TO SPEND A FEW HOURS MY SWEET RENEE
UNDER PENALTY THEREFORE OF FORFEITING MY ESTEEM AND AFFECTION HE MUST GET HIMSELF CHOSEN DEPUTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AT THE COMING ELECTIONS MY FAMILY WOULD SUPPORT HIS CANDIDATURE AND WE SHOULD THEN HAVE THE DELIGHT OF SPENDING ALL OUR WINTERS IN PARIS
WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN IN PERFECT TRUST AND MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF GIVING VARIETY TO THE INFINITE THIS IS THE TASK SET BEFORE EVERY TRUE WIFE THE ANSWER BEGINS TO DAWN ON ME AND I SHALL NOT REST TILL I HAVE MADE IT MINE
FOR HIS COQUETTISH WHITE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS BLUE ROOF GLITTERING IN THE SUN THE GARDEN AND SURROUNDING WALKS ARE HORRIBLY DUSTY AND THE TREES SEEM BURNT UP
WHEN I AM WITH YOU LOVE SO TRANSPORTS ME THAT I AM POWERLESS TO EXPRESS THE DEPTH OF MY AFFECTION I CAN BUT WORSHIP AND ADMIRE ONLY AT A DISTANCE DOES THE POWER OF SPEECH RETURN
AH DARLING MY LIFE UNROLLS ITSELF BEFORE MY EYES LIKE ONE OF THE GREAT HIGHWAYS OF FRANCE LEVEL AND EASY SHADED WITH EVERGREEN TREES THIS CENTURY WILL NOT SEE ANOTHER BONAPARTE
DURING THIS TIME I MADE A CLOSE STUDY OF MANY SMALL PERSONAL MATTERS WHICH HAVE MORE TO DO WITH LOVE THAN IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED IN SPITE OF MY COLDNESS LOUIS GREW BOLDER AND HIS NATURE EXPANDED I SAW ON HIS FACE A NEW EXPRESSION
FIDELITY AND COMPLAISANCE ARE THE PRINCIPAL DUTIES OF BOTH AND THOSE MEN WHO DO NOT CHOOSE TO DANCE OR MARRY THEMSELVES HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH THE PARTNERS OR WIVES OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THEY ARE SUCH VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
CONFUSED BY HIS NOTICE AND BLUSHING FROM THE FEAR OF ITS BEING EXCITED BY SOMETHING WRONG IN HER APPEARANCE SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
SHE ENTERED THE ROOMS ON THURSDAY EVENING WITH FEELINGS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAD ATTENDED HER THITHER THE MONDAY BEFORE
FOR IF I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TALK TO THEM AND BESIDES I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A SECURITY WORTH HAVING AND I SHALL PROCEED WITH COURAGE
I ASSURE YOU MY BROTHER IS QUITE IN LOVE WITH YOU ALREADY AND AS FOR MISTER TILNEY BUT THAT IS A SETTLED THING EVEN YOUR MODESTY CANNOT DOUBT HIS ATTACHMENT NOW HIS COMING BACK TO BATH MAKES IT TOO PLAIN OH
TWELVE O'CLOCK WAS HER PARTING SPEECH TO HER NEW FRIEND OF HER OTHER HER OLDER HER MORE ESTABLISHED FRIEND ISABELLA OF WHOSE FIDELITY AND WORTH SHE HAD ENJOYED A FORTNIGHT'S EXPERIENCE SHE SCARCELY SAW ANYTHING DURING THE EVENING
NO INDEED I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEN I AM QUITE AT A LOSS ONE THING HOWEVER I MUST OBSERVE THIS DISPOSITION ON YOUR SIDE IS RATHER ALARMING
FIGURE AND DRESS AND FELT GRATEFUL AS WELL SHE MIGHT FOR THE CHANCE WHICH HAD PROCURED HER SUCH A FRIEND MISSUS THORPE WAS A WIDOW AND NOT A VERY RICH ONE SHE WAS A GOOD HUMOURED WELL MEANING WOMAN
SHE KEPT HER EYES INTENTLY FIXED ON HER FAN AND A SELF CONDEMNATION FOR HER FOLLY IN SUPPOSING THAT AMONG SUCH A CROWD THEY SHOULD EVEN MEET WITH THE TILNEYS IN ANY REASONABLE TIME HAD JUST PASSED THROUGH HER MIND WHEN SHE SUDDENLY FOUND HERSELF ADDRESSED
MISTER TILNEY DID NOT APPEAR EVERY CREATURE IN BATH EXCEPT HIMSELF WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE ROOM AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE FASHIONABLE HOURS
NOW MISTER MORLAND FOR HE WAS CLOSE TO HER ON THE OTHER SIDE I SHALL NOT SPEAK ANOTHER WORD TO YOU ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING SO I CHARGE YOU NOT TO EXPECT IT MY SWEETEST CATHERINE HOW HAVE YOU BEEN THIS LONG AGE
MISTER TILNEY WAS VERY MUCH AMUSED ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN HE REPEATED WHAT A PICTURE OF INTELLECTUAL POVERTY HOWEVER WHEN YOU SINK INTO THIS ABYSS AGAIN YOU WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY
WHAT WOULD NOT I GIVE TO SEE HIM I REALLY AM QUITE WILD WITH IMPATIENCE MY MOTHER SAYS HE IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD SHE SAW HIM THIS MORNING YOU KNOW YOU MUST INTRODUCE HIM TO ME
THAT GENTLEMAN WOULD HAVE PUT ME OUT OF PATIENCE HAD HE STAYED WITH YOU HALF A MINUTE LONGER HE HAS NO BUSINESS TO WITHDRAW THE ATTENTION OF MY PARTNER FROM ME WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT OF MUTUAL AGREEABLENESS FOR THE SPACE OF AN EVENING
AM I NEVER TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM HOW DO YOU LIKE MY GOWN I THINK IT DOES NOT LOOK AMISS THE SLEEVES WERE ENTIRELY MY OWN THOUGHT DO YOU KNOW I GET SO IMMODERATELY SICK OF BATH
AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES ON THE NOTICE OF ONE WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER I CONSIDER A COUNTRY DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE
AND MISSUS ALLEN IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE FEATURES OF A FORMER SCHOOLFELLOW AND INTIMATE WHOM SHE HAD SEEN ONLY ONCE SINCE THEIR RESPECTIVE MARRIAGES AND THAT MANY YEARS AGO THEIR JOY ON THIS MEETING WAS VERY GREAT
CONSOLING HERSELF HOWEVER WITH THE DISCOVERY WHICH HER KEEN EYE SOON MADE
AND WAS NOW CHIEFLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID HIS SIGHT LEST HE SHOULD ENGAGE HER AGAIN FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT DARED NOT EXPECT THAT MISTER TILNEY SHOULD ASK HER A THIRD TIME TO DANCE
NEAR LONDON THE WHOLE BEING EXPLAINED MANY OBLIGING THINGS WERE SAID BY THE MISS THORPES OF THEIR WISH OF BEING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER OF BEING CONSIDERED AS ALREADY FRIENDS THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP OF THEIR BROTHERS ET CETERA WHICH CATHERINE HEARD WITH PLEASURE
AND AGAIN SOLICITED TO DANCE BY MISTER TILNEY HIMSELF WITH WHAT SPARKLING EYES AND READY MOTION SHE GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND WITH HOW PLEASING A FLUTTER OF HEART SHE WENT WITH HIM TO THE SET MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED
I HOPE I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AGAIN SOON SAID CATHERINE SHALL YOU BE AT THE COTILLION BALL TOMORROW PERHAPS WE YES I THINK WE CERTAINLY SHALL I AM GLAD OF IT FOR WE SHALL ALL BE THERE
HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT VERY ODD TO HEAR ME SAY I WAS ENGAGED THE OTHER EVENING WHEN HE SAW ME SITTING DOWN BUT I REALLY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHOLE DAY TO MISTER THORPE MISS TILNEY COULD ONLY BOW
THIS WAS THE LAST SENTENCE BY WHICH HE COULD WEARY CATHERINE'S ATTENTION FOR HE WAS JUST THEN BORNE OFF BY THE RESISTLESS PRESSURE OF A LONG STRING OF PASSING LADIES HER PARTNER NOW DREW NEAR AND SAID
BUT I NEED NOT ASK YOU FOR YOU LOOK DELIGHTFULLY YOU REALLY HAVE DONE YOUR HAIR IN A MORE HEAVENLY STYLE THAN EVER
RETURNED HER ADVANCES WITH EQUAL GOODWILL AND THEY CONTINUED TALKING TOGETHER AS LONG AS BOTH PARTIES REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND THOUGH IN ALL PROBABILITY NOT AN OBSERVATION WAS MADE
THIS BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE FAMILY IS INTENDED TO SUPERSEDE THE NECESSITY OF A LONG AND MINUTE DETAIL FROM MISSUS THORPE HERSELF OF HER PAST ADVENTURES AND SUFFERINGS
I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD BE TIRED IF I WERE TO STAY HERE SIX MONTHS BATH COMPARED WITH LONDON HAS LITTLE VARIETY AND SO EVERYBODY FINDS OUT EVERY YEAR FOR SIX WEEKS I ALLOW BATH IS PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT BEYOND THAT IT IS THE MOST TIRESOME PLACE IN THE WORLD
THE MORNING HAD ANSWERED ALL HER HOPES AND THE EVENING OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS NOW THE OBJECT OF EXPECTATION THE FUTURE GOOD WHAT GOWN AND WHAT HEAD DRESS SHE SHOULD WEAR ON THE OCCASION BECAME HER CHIEF CONCERN
WHERE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF EVENTS AND CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE MISTER ALLEN AFTER DRINKING HIS GLASS OF WATER JOINED SOME GENTLEMEN TO TALK OVER THE POLITICS OF THE DAY AND COMPARE THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR NEWSPAPERS
IN MARRIAGE THE MAN IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN TO MAKE THE HOME AGREEABLE TO THE MAN HE IS TO PURVEY AND SHE IS TO SMILE BUT IN DANCING THEIR DUTIES ARE EXACTLY CHANGED
DOOR OF MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE AND THAT THEY SHOULD THERE PART WITH A MOST AFFECTIONATE AND LENGTHENED SHAKE OF HANDS AFTER LEARNING TO THEIR MUTUAL RELIEF THAT THEY SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER ACROSS THE THEATRE AT NIGHT AND SAY THEIR PRAYERS IN THE SAME CHAPEL
AND DO NOT LET US PUT IT OFF LET US GO TOMORROW THIS WAS READILY AGREED TO WITH ONLY A PROVISO OF MISS TILNEY'S THAT IT DID NOT RAIN WHICH CATHERINE WAS SURE IT WOULD NOT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THEY WERE TO CALL FOR HER IN PULTENEY STREET AND REMEMBER
WAS NOT THE YOUNG LADY HE DANCED WITH ON MONDAY A MISS SMITH YES AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS HUGHES I DARE SAY SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO DANCE DO YOU THINK HER PRETTY NOT VERY
I SEE THAT YOU GUESS WHAT I HAVE JUST BEEN ASKED THAT GENTLEMAN KNOWS YOUR NAME AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW HIS IT IS GENERAL TILNEY MY FATHER CATHERINE'S ANSWER WAS ONLY OH BUT IT WAS AN OH EXPRESSING EVERYTHING NEEDFUL
AT LENGTH HOWEVER SHE WAS EMPOWERED TO DISENGAGE HERSELF FROM HER FRIEND BY THE AVOWED NECESSITY OF SPEAKING TO MISS TILNEY WHOM SHE MOST JOYFULLY SAW JUST ENTERING THE ROOM WITH MISSUS HUGHES
SHE CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED IN IT DRESS IS AT ALL TIMES A FRIVOLOUS DISTINCTION AND EXCESSIVE SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT OFTEN DESTROYS ITS OWN AIM CATHERINE KNEW ALL THIS VERY WELL HER GREAT AUNT HAD READ HER A LECTURE ON THE SUBJECT ONLY THE CHRISTMAS BEFORE
THIS CIVILITY WAS DULY RETURNED AND THEY PARTED ON MISS TILNEY'S SIDE WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE'S FEELINGS AND ON CATHERINE'S WITHOUT THE SMALLEST CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING EXPLAINED THEM SHE WENT HOME VERY HAPPY
AND WHOM SHE INSTANTLY JOINED WITH A FIRMER DETERMINATION TO BE ACQUAINTED THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD COURAGE TO COMMAND HAD SHE NOT BEEN URGED BY THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE DAY BEFORE MISS TILNEY MET HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY
THE COTILLIONS WERE OVER THE COUNTRY DANCING BEGINNING AND SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE TILNEYS DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED MY DEAR CATHERINE WHISPERED ISABELLA BUT I AM REALLY GOING TO DANCE WITH YOUR BROTHER AGAIN
IN CHATTING WITH MISS TILNEY BEFORE THE EVENING CONCLUDED A NEW SOURCE OF FELICITY AROSE TO HER SHE HAD NEVER TAKEN A COUNTRY WALK SINCE HER ARRIVAL IN BATH MISS TILNEY TO WHOM ALL THE COMMONLY FREQUENTED ENVIRONS WERE FAMILIAR
AND A VERY INDULGENT MOTHER HER ELDEST DAUGHTER HAD GREAT PERSONAL BEAUTY AND THE YOUNGER ONES BY PRETENDING TO BE AS HANDSOME AS THEIR SISTER IMITATING HER AIR AND DRESSING IN THE SAME STYLE DID VERY WELL
EDWARD AT MERCHANT TAYLORS AND WILLIAM AT SEA AND ALL OF THEM MORE BELOVED AND RESPECTED IN THEIR DIFFERENT STATION THAN ANY OTHER THREE BEINGS EVER WERE
IN WHICH THE WORTHLESSNESS OF LORDS AND ATTORNEYS MIGHT BE SET FORTH
SPOKE OF THEM IN TERMS WHICH MADE HER ALL EAGERNESS TO KNOW THEM TOO AND ON HER OPENLY FEARING THAT SHE MIGHT FIND NOBODY TO GO WITH HER IT WAS PROPOSED BY THE BROTHER AND SISTER THAT THEY SHOULD JOIN IN A WALK SOME MORNING OR OTHER I SHALL LIKE IT SHE CRIED
OF A COMMANDING ASPECT PAST THE BLOOM BUT NOT PAST THE VIGOUR OF LIFE AND WITH HIS EYE STILL DIRECTED TOWARDS HER SHE SAW HIM PRESENTLY ADDRESS MISTER TILNEY IN A FAMILIAR WHISPER
CATHERINE HAD NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO ANSWER THE OTHERS WALKED AWAY JOHN THORPE WAS STILL IN VIEW AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP FOR LOST THAT SHE MIGHT NOT APPEAR HOWEVER TO OBSERVE OR EXPECT HIM
FAR MORE READY TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND EACH HEARING VERY LITTLE OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID MISSUS THORPE HOWEVER HAD ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE AS A TALKER OVER MISSUS ALLEN IN A FAMILY OF CHILDREN
ISABELLA SMILED INCREDULOUSLY AND TALKED THE REST OF THE EVENING TO JAMES CATHERINE'S RESOLUTION OF ENDEAVOURING TO MEET MISS TILNEY AGAIN CONTINUED IN FULL FORCE THE NEXT MORNING
WOMAN IS FINE FOR HER OWN SATISFACTION ALONE NO MAN WILL ADMIRE HER THE MORE NO WOMAN WILL LIKE HER THE BETTER FOR IT
BEFORE SHE REMEMBERED THAT HER ELDEST BROTHER HAD LATELY FORMED AN INTIMACY WITH A YOUNG MAN OF HIS OWN COLLEGE OF THE NAME OF THORPE
SHE COULD COMPARE THE BALLS OF BATH WITH THOSE OF TUNBRIDGE ITS FASHIONS WITH THE FASHIONS OF LONDON COULD RECTIFY THE OPINIONS OF HER NEW FRIEND IN MANY ARTICLES OF TASTEFUL ATTIRE COULD DISCOVER A FLIRTATION BETWEEN ANY GENTLEMAN AND LADY WHO
OH YES I SHALL NEVER BE IN WANT OF SOMETHING TO TALK OF AGAIN TO MISSUS ALLEN OR ANYBODY ELSE I REALLY BELIEVE I SHALL ALWAYS BE TALKING OF BATH WHEN I AM AT HOME AGAIN
OR SOME NONSENSE OF THAT KIND WHICH WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED ME BEYOND CONCEPTION
IS HE IN THE HOUSE NOW LOOK ABOUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE I ASSURE YOU I CAN HARDLY EXIST TILL I SEE HIM NO SAID CATHERINE HE IS NOT HERE I CANNOT SEE HIM ANYWHERE OH HORRID
GREAT THOUGH NOT UNCOMMON FROM WHICH ONE OF THE OTHER SEX RATHER THAN HER OWN A BROTHER RATHER THAN A GREAT AUNT MIGHT HAVE WARNED HER
THEIR INCREASING ATTACHMENT WAS NOT TO BE SATISFIED WITH HALF A DOZEN TURNS IN THE PUMP ROOM BUT REQUIRED WHEN THEY ALL QUITTED IT TOGETHER
AND YET SHE LAY AWAKE TEN MINUTES ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT DEBATING BETWEEN HER SPOTTED AND HER TAMBOURED MUSLIN AND NOTHING BUT THE SHORTNESS OF THE TIME PREVENTED HER BUYING A NEW ONE FOR THE EVENING THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT
ATTENTION TO HIS WORDS AND PERFECT RELIANCE ON THEIR TRUTH WITH REAL INTEREST AND STRONG ADMIRATION DID HER EYE NOW FOLLOW THE GENERAL AS HE MOVED THROUGH THE CROWD AND HOW HANDSOME A FAMILY THEY ARE WAS HER SECRET REMARK
HAD NOT THE EASY GAIETY OF MISS THORPE'S MANNERS AND HER FREQUENT EXPRESSIONS OF DELIGHT ON THIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER SOFTENED DOWN EVERY FEELING OF AWE AND LEFT NOTHING BUT TENDER AFFECTION
YOUR BROTHER AND I WERE AGREEING THIS MORNING THAT THOUGH IT IS VASTLY WELL TO BE HERE FOR A FEW WEEKS WE WOULD NOT LIVE HERE FOR MILLIONS WE SOON FOUND OUT THAT OUR TASTES WERE EXACTLY ALIKE IN PREFERRING THE COUNTRY TO EVERY OTHER PLACE
AND WHEN SHE EXPATIATED ON THE TALENTS OF HER SONS AND THE BEAUTY OF HER DAUGHTERS WHEN SHE RELATED THEIR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND VIEWS THAT JOHN WAS AT OXFORD
AND THE HONEST RELISH OF BALLS AND PLAYS AND EVERYDAY SIGHTS IS PAST WITH THEM HERE THEIR CONVERSATION CLOSED THE DEMANDS OF THE DANCE BECOMING NOW TOO IMPORTUNATE FOR A DIVIDED ATTENTION
AND ALMOST FORGOT MISTER TILNEY WHILE SHE TALKED TO MISS THORPE FRIENDSHIP IS CERTAINLY THE FINEST BALM FOR THE PANGS OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE THEIR CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THOSE SUBJECTS OF WHICH THE FREE DISCUSSION HAS GENERALLY MUCH TO DO IN PERFECTING A SUDDEN INTIMACY BETWEEN TWO YOUNG LADIES
HE CAME ONLY TO ENGAGE LODGINGS FOR US
A FAMOUS CLEVER ANIMAL FOR THE ROAD ONLY FORTY GUINEAS I HAD FIFTY MINDS TO BUY IT MYSELF
HE NEVER COMES TO THE PUMP ROOM I SUPPOSE YES SOMETIMES BUT HE HAS RID OUT THIS MORNING WITH MY FATHER MISSUS HUGHES NOW JOINED THEM AND ASKED MISS TILNEY IF SHE WAS READY TO GO
DO YOU FIND BATH AS AGREEABLE AS WHEN I HAD THE HONOUR OF MAKING THE INQUIRY BEFORE YES QUITE MORE SO INDEED MORE SO TAKE CARE OR YOU WILL FORGET TO BE TIRED OF IT AT THE PROPER TIME YOU OUGHT TO BE TIRED AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS
THE MISS THORPES WERE INTRODUCED AND MISS MORLAND WHO HAD BEEN FOR A SHORT TIME FORGOTTEN WAS INTRODUCED LIKEWISE THE NAME SEEMED TO STRIKE THEM ALL AND AFTER SPEAKING TO HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY
IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU BUT IS NOT YOUR NAME ALLEN THIS QUESTION ANSWERED AS IT READILY WAS THE STRANGER PRONOUNCED HERS TO BE THORPE
UP THE STEPS AND DOWN PEOPLE WHOM NOBODY CARED ABOUT AND NOBODY WANTED TO SEE AND HE ONLY WAS ABSENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL PLACE BATH IS SAID MISSUS ALLEN AS THEY SAT DOWN NEAR THE GREAT CLOCK
HOW LITTLE THEY HAD THOUGHT OF MEETING IN BATH AND WHAT A PLEASURE IT WAS TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND THEY PROCEEDED TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND GIVE INTELLIGENCE AS TO THEIR FAMILIES SISTERS AND COUSINS TALKING BOTH TOGETHER
THAT IN BOTH IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN FORMED FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF EACH AND THAT WHEN ONCE ENTERED INTO THEY BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO EACH OTHER TILL THE MOMENT OF ITS DISSOLUTION THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY
NOR AN EXPRESSION USED BY EITHER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MADE AND USED SOME THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE UNDER THAT ROOF IN EVERY BATH SEASON
THE ELDEST YOUNG LADY OBSERVED ALOUD TO THE REST HOW EXCESSIVELY LIKE HER BROTHER MISS MORLAND IS
TILL CATHERINE BEGAN TO DOUBT THE HAPPINESS OF A SITUATION WHICH CONFINING HER ENTIRELY TO HER FRIEND AND BROTHER GAVE HER VERY LITTLE SHARE IN THE NOTICE OF EITHER THEY WERE ALWAYS ENGAGED IN SOME SENTIMENTAL DISCUSSION OR LIVELY DISPUTE
REALLY OUR OPINIONS WERE SO EXACTLY THE SAME IT WAS QUITE RIDICULOUS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE POINT IN WHICH WE DIFFERED I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD YOU ARE SUCH A SLY THING I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE MADE SOME DROLL REMARK OR OTHER ABOUT IT
MISTER THORPE IS SUCH A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MY BROTHER'S THAT IF HE TALKS TO ME I MUST TALK TO HIM AGAIN BUT THERE ARE HARDLY THREE YOUNG MEN IN THE ROOM BESIDES HIM THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH AND IS THAT TO BE MY ONLY SECURITY ALAS ALAS
ONE DAY IN THE COUNTRY IS EXACTLY LIKE ANOTHER BUT THEN YOU SPEND YOUR TIME SO MUCH MORE RATIONALLY IN THE COUNTRY DO I DO YOU NOT I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH DIFFERENCE HERE YOU ARE IN PURSUIT ONLY OF AMUSEMENT ALL DAY LONG
AND THE LADIES WALKED ABOUT TOGETHER NOTICING EVERY NEW FACE AND ALMOST EVERY NEW BONNET IN THE ROOM THE FEMALE PART OF THE THORPE FAMILY ATTENDED BY JAMES MORLAND APPEARED AMONG THE CROWD IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
SOON AFTER THEIR REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE SET CATHERINE PERCEIVED HERSELF TO BE EARNESTLY REGARDED BY A GENTLEMAN WHO STOOD AMONG THE LOOKERS ON IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HER PARTNER
THE AGREEABLENESS THE COMPLIANCE ARE EXPECTED FROM HIM WHILE SHE FURNISHES THE FAN AND THE LAVENDER WATER THAT I SUPPOSE WAS THE DIFFERENCE OF DUTIES WHICH STRUCK YOU AS RENDERING THE CONDITIONS INCAPABLE OF COMPARISON
I DO LIKE IT SO VERY MUCH IF I COULD BUT HAVE PAPA AND MAMMA AND THE REST OF THEM HERE I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE TOO HAPPY JAMES'S COMING MY ELDEST BROTHER IS QUITE DELIGHTFUL
ALL HAVE BEEN OR AT LEAST ALL HAVE BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE IN DANGER FROM THE PURSUIT OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY WISHED TO AVOID AND ALL HAVE BEEN ANXIOUS FOR THE ATTENTIONS OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY
THIS SENTIMENT HAD BEEN UTTERED SO OFTEN IN VAIN THAT MISSUS ALLEN HAD NO PARTICULAR REASON TO HOPE IT WOULD BE FOLLOWED WITH MORE ADVANTAGE NOW BUT WE ARE TOLD TO DESPAIR OF NOTHING WE WOULD ATTAIN AS UNWEARIED
WHAT IS COSTLY OR NEW IN THEIR ATTIRE HOW LITTLE IT IS BIASED BY THE TEXTURE OF THEIR MUSLIN AND HOW UNSUSCEPTIBLE OF PECULIAR TENDERNESS TOWARDS THE SPOTTED
WITH MORE THAN USUAL EAGERNESS DID CATHERINE HASTEN TO THE PUMP ROOM THE NEXT DAY SECURE WITHIN HERSELF OF SEEING MISTER TILNEY THERE BEFORE THE MORNING WERE OVER AND READY TO MEET HIM WITH A SMILE BUT NO SMILE WAS DEMANDED
YOU WILL ALLOW ALL THIS YES TO BE SURE AS YOU STATE IT ALL THIS SOUNDS VERY WELL BUT STILL THEY ARE SO VERY DIFFERENT I CANNOT LOOK UPON THEM AT ALL IN THE SAME LIGHT NOR THINK THE SAME DUTIES BELONG TO THEM IN ONE RESPECT THERE CERTAINLY IS A DIFFERENCE
I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD INDEED YOU DO ME INJUSTICE I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SO IMPROPER A REMARK UPON ANY ACCOUNT AND BESIDES I AM SURE IT WOULD NEVER HAVE ENTERED MY HEAD
SUCH AS DRESS BALLS FLIRTATIONS AND QUIZZES MISS THORPE HOWEVER BEING FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN MISS MORLAND AND AT LEAST FOUR YEARS BETTER INFORMED
WISHED TO PLEASE AS SOON AS THEY WERE JOINED BY THE THORPES CATHERINE'S AGONY BEGAN SHE FIDGETED ABOUT IF JOHN THORPE CAME TOWARDS HER HID HERSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM HIS VIEW AND WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR HIM
WHICH I CAN KNOW NOTHING OF THERE YOU ARE NOT FOND OF THE COUNTRY YES I AM I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED THERE AND ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY
AND POINT OUT A QUIZ THROUGH THE THICKNESS OF A CROWD THESE POWERS RECEIVED DUE ADMIRATION FROM CATHERINE TO WHOM THEY WERE ENTIRELY NEW AND THE RESPECT WHICH THEY NATURALLY INSPIRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO GREAT FOR FAMILIARITY
HOW WELL YOUR BROTHER DANCES WAS AN ARTLESS EXCLAMATION OF CATHERINE'S TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH AT ONCE SURPRISED AND AMUSED HER COMPANION HENRY SHE REPLIED WITH A SMILE YES HE DOES DANCE VERY WELL
WELL OTHER PEOPLE MUST JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE WHO GO TO LONDON MAY THINK NOTHING OF BATH BUT I WHO LIVE IN A SMALL RETIRED VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY CAN NEVER FIND GREATER SAMENESS IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAN IN MY OWN HOME
TILNEY HE REPEATED HUM I DO NOT KNOW HIM A GOOD FIGURE OF A MAN WELL PUT TOGETHER
THAT YOU THINK THEY CANNOT BE COMPARED TOGETHER TO BE SURE NOT PEOPLE THAT MARRY CAN NEVER PART BUT MUST GO AND KEEP HOUSE TOGETHER PEOPLE THAT DANCE ONLY STAND OPPOSITE EACH OTHER IN A LONG ROOM FOR HALF AN HOUR
AND SUCH IS YOUR DEFINITION OF MATRIMONY AND DANCING TAKEN IN THAT LIGHT CERTAINLY THEIR RESEMBLANCE IS NOT STRIKING BUT I THINK I COULD PLACE THEM IN SUCH A VIEW YOU WILL ALLOW THAT IN BOTH MAN HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF CHOICE WOMAN ONLY THE POWER OF REFUSAL
THE TALLEST IS ISABELLA MY ELDEST IS NOT SHE A FINE YOUNG WOMAN THE OTHERS ARE VERY MUCH ADMIRED TOO BUT I BELIEVE ISABELLA IS THE HANDSOMEST
BEFORE A LADY OF ABOUT HER OWN AGE WHO WAS SITTING BY HER AND HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER ATTENTIVELY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ADDRESSED HER WITH GREAT COMPLAISANCE IN THESE WORDS
WAS REPEATED BY THEM ALL TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER FOR A MOMENT CATHERINE WAS SURPRISED BUT MISSUS THORPE AND HER DAUGHTERS HAD SCARCELY BEGUN THE HISTORY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER JAMES MORLAND
AND ESPECIALLY AS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE VERY FAMILY WE ARE JUST GOT SO INTIMATE WITH ARE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS ALREADY OH WHO CAN EVER BE TIRED OF BATH NOT THOSE WHO BRING SUCH FRESH FEELINGS OF EVERY SORT TO IT AS YOU DO
AND TILL THE USUAL MOMENT OF GOING TO THE PUMP ROOM SHE FELT SOME ALARM FROM THE DREAD OF A SECOND PREVENTION BUT NOTHING OF THAT KIND OCCURRED NO VISITORS APPEARED TO DELAY THEM AND THEY ALL THREE SET OFF IN GOOD TIME FOR THE PUMP ROOM
AFTER PARADING THE ROOM TILL THEY WERE TIRED AND HOW PLEASANT IT WOULD BE IF WE HAD ANY ACQUAINTANCE HERE
AND CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY TOOK HER USUAL PLACE BY THE SIDE OF HER FRIEND JAMES WHO WAS NOW IN CONSTANT ATTENDANCE MAINTAINED A SIMILAR POSITION AND SEPARATING THEMSELVES FROM THE REST OF THEIR PARTY THEY WALKED IN THAT MANNER FOR SOME TIME
SINCE THEY HAD BEEN CONTENTED TO KNOW NOTHING OF EACH OTHER FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS COMPLIMENTS ON GOOD LOOKS NOW PASSED AND AFTER OBSERVING HOW TIME HAD SLIPPED AWAY SINCE THEY WERE LAST TOGETHER
DILIGENCE OUR POINT WOULD GAIN AND THE UNWEARIED DILIGENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD EVERY DAY WISHED FOR THE SAME THING WAS AT LENGTH TO HAVE ITS JUST REWARD FOR HARDLY HAD SHE BEEN SEATED TEN MINUTES
BUT IT WOULD NOT ANSWER MY PURPOSE IT WOULD NOT DO FOR THE FIELD I WOULD GIVE ANY MONEY FOR A REAL GOOD HUNTER I HAVE THREE NOW THE BEST THAT EVER WERE BACKED I WOULD NOT TAKE EIGHT HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR THEM
EACH TO ENDEAVOUR TO GIVE THE OTHER NO CAUSE FOR WISHING THAT HE OR SHE HAD BESTOWED THEMSELVES ELSEWHERE AND THEIR BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THEIR OWN IMAGINATIONS FROM WANDERING TOWARDS THE PERFECTIONS OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS
NO INDEED I SHOULD NOT OH YES YOU WOULD INDEED I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
THAT THOUGH CATHERINE'S SUPPORTING OPINION WAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY CALLED FOR BY ONE OR THE OTHER SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO GIVE ANY
YOU TOTALLY DISALLOW ANY SIMILARITY IN THE OBLIGATIONS AND MAY I NOT THENCE INFER THAT YOUR NOTIONS OF THE DUTIES OF THE DANCING STATE ARE NOT SO STRICT AS YOUR PARTNER MIGHT WISH HAVE I NOT REASON TO FEAR THAT IF THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE TO YOU JUST NOW WERE TO RETURN
HER WISHES HOPES AND PLANS ALL CENTRED IN NOTHING LESS EVERY YOUNG LADY MAY FEEL FOR MY HEROINE IN THIS CRITICAL MOMENT FOR EVERY YOUNG LADY HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER KNOWN THE SAME AGITATION
NEATNESS AND FASHION ARE ENOUGH FOR THE FORMER AND A SOMETHING OF SHABBINESS OR IMPROPRIETY WILL BE MOST ENDEARING TO THE LATTER BUT NOT ONE OF THESE GRAVE REFLECTIONS TROUBLED THE TRANQUILLITY OF CATHERINE
AND ANSWERED WITH ALL THE PRETTY EXPRESSIONS SHE COULD COMMAND AND AS THE FIRST PROOF OF AMITY SHE WAS SOON INVITED TO ACCEPT AN ARM OF THE ELDEST MISS THORPE AND TAKE A TURN WITH HER ABOUT THE ROOM CATHERINE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS EXTENSION OF HER BATH ACQUAINTANCE
HOW SURPRISED I WAS TO SEE HIM AGAIN I FELT SO SURE OF HIS BEING QUITE GONE AWAY
TO ESCAPE AND AS SHE BELIEVED SO NARROWLY ESCAPE JOHN THORPE AND TO BE ASKED SO IMMEDIATELY ON HIS JOINING HER ASKED BY MISTER TILNEY AS IF HE HAD SOUGHT HER ON PURPOSE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HER THAT LIFE COULD SUPPLY ANY GREATER FELICITY
MISSUS ALLEN HAD NO SIMILAR INFORMATION TO GIVE NO SIMILAR TRIUMPHS TO PRESS ON THE UNWILLING AND UNBELIEVING EAR OF HER FRIEND
THAT THOU WILT SATISFY ME WITH THY NAME O LEAF OF MINE IN WHOM I PLEASURE TOOK E'EN WHILE AWAITING I WAS THINE OWN ROOT SUCH A BEGINNING HE IN ANSWER MADE ME THEN SAID TO ME THAT ONE FROM WHOM IS NAMED THY RACE
AND IF IT DO REMAIN SAY IN WHAT MANNER AFTER YE ARE AGAIN MADE VISIBLE IT CAN BE THAT IT INJURE NOT YOUR SIGHT AS BY A GREATER GLADNESS URGED AND DRAWN THEY WHO ARE DANCING IN A RING SOMETIMES UPLIFT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR MOTIONS QUICKEN
AND HE WILL HAVE SOME SHADOWING FORTH OF THAT TRUE CONSTELLATION AND THE DOUBLE DANCE THAT CIRCLED ROUND THE POINT AT WHICH I WAS BECAUSE IT IS AS MUCH BEYOND OUR WONT AS SWIFTER THAN THE MOTION OF THE CHIANA MOVETH THE HEAVEN THAT ALL THE REST OUTSPEEDS
BUT BEATRICE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING APPEARED TO ME THAT WITH THE OTHER SIGHTS THAT FOLLOWED NOT MY MEMORY I MUST LEAVE HER THEN TO UPLIFT THEMSELVES MINE EYES RESUMED THE POWER AND I BEHELD MYSELF TRANSLATED TO HIGHER SALVATION WITH MY LADY ONLY
THAT IT WEIGHS DOWN THE BALANCE OF ALL SIN WHATE'ER OF LIGHT IT HAS TO HUMAN NATURE BEEN LAWFUL TO POSSESS WAS ALL INFUSED BY THE SAME POWER THAT BOTH OF THEM CREATED AND HENCE AT WHAT I SAID ABOVE DOST WONDER
SOME WHO TURN FLORENTINES AND TRADE AND DISCOUNT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK AGAIN TO SIMIFONTE THERE WHERE THEIR GRANDSIRES WENT ABOUT AS BEGGARS AT MONTEMURLO STILL WOULD BE THE COUNTS THE CERCHI IN THE PARISH OF ACONE PERHAPS IN VALDIGRIEVE
SO AT THAT ORISON DEVOUT AND PROMPT THE HOLY CIRCLES A NEW JOY DISPLAYED IN THEIR REVOLVING AND THEIR WONDROUS SONG WHOSO LAMENTETH HIM THAT HERE WE DIE THAT WE MAY LIVE ABOVE HAS NEVER THERE SEEN THE REFRESHMENT OF THE ETERNAL RAIN
THE ONE AND TWO AND THREE WHO EVER LIVETH AND REIGNETH EVER IN THREE AND TWO AND ONE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED AND ALL THINGS CIRCUMSCRIBING THREE SEVERAL TIMES WAS CHANTED BY EACH ONE AMONG THOSE SPIRITS WITH SUCH MELODY THAT FOR ALL MERIT IT WERE JUST REWARD
THAT SOON IT SHALL BE JETSAM FROM THE BARK THE RAVIGNANI WERE FROM WHOM DESCENDED THE COUNTY GUIDO AND WHOE'ER THE NAME OF THE GREAT BELLINCIONE SINCE HATH TAKEN HE OF LA PRESSA KNEW THE ART OF RULING ALREADY
AS FROM WITHOUT TIS STRUCK OR FROM WITHIN INTO MY MIND UPON A SUDDEN DROPPED WHAT I AM SAYING AT THE MOMENT WHEN SILENT BECAME THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF THOMAS BECAUSE OF THE RESEMBLANCE THAT WAS BORN OF HIS DISCOURSE AND THAT OF BEATRICE WHOM AFTER HIM IT PLEASED THUS TO BEGIN
I AM AS I AM WONT TWILL NOT BE FROM CASAL NOR ACQUASPARTA FROM WHENCE COME SUCH UNTO THE WRITTEN WORD THAT ONE AVOIDS IT AND THE OTHER NARROWS
WHO HAST UNTO MY SEED SO COURTEOUS BEEN AND IT CONTINUED HUNGER LONG AND GRATEFUL DRAWN FROM THE READING OF THE MIGHTY VOLUME WHEREIN IS NEVER CHANGED THE WHITE NOR DARK THOU HAST APPEASED MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT IN WHICH I SPEAK TO THEE
NOW IF NO FARTHER FORTH I SHOULD PROCEED THEN IN WHAT WAY WAS HE WITHOUT A PEER
WHEN THE EMPEROR WHO REIGNETH EVERMORE PROVIDED FOR THE HOST THAT WAS IN PERIL THROUGH GRACE ALONE AND NOT THAT IT WAS WORTHY AND AS WAS SAID HE TO HIS BRIDE BROUGHT SUCCOUR WITH CHAMPIONS TWAIN AT WHOSE DEED AT WHOSE WORD THE STRAGGLING PEOPLE WERE TOGETHER DRAWN
AND ALREADY GALIGAJO HAD HILT AND POMMEL GILDED IN HIS HOUSE MIGHTY ALREADY WAS THE COLUMN VAIR SACCHETTI GIUOCHI FIFANT AND BARUCCI AND GALLI AND THEY WHO FOR THE BUSHEL BLUSH
THE WOMAN WHO FOR HIM HAD GIVEN ASSENT SAW IN A DREAM THE ADMIRABLE FRUIT THAT ISSUE WOULD FROM HIM AND FROM HIS HEIRS AND THAT HE MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS HE WAS A SPIRIT FROM THIS PLACE WENT FORTH TO NAME HIM WITH HIS POSSESSIVE WHOSE HE WHOLLY WAS
WHO I AM THOU ASKEST NOT AND WHY I SEEM MORE JOYOUS UNTO THEE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GLADSOME CROWD THOU THINK'ST THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE SMALL AND GREAT OF THIS EXISTENCE LOOK INTO THE MIRROR WHEREIN BEFORE THOU THINK'ST THY THOUGHT THOU SHOWEST
THEN BROKE THE SILENCE OF THOSE SAINTS CONCORDANT THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ADMIRABLE LIFE OF GOD'S OWN MENDICANT WAS TOLD TO ME AND SAID
I SAY IN HEAVEN OF THEE I MADE A BOAST TRULY THOU ART A CLOAK THAT QUICKLY SHORTENS SO THAT UNLESS WE PIECE THEE DAY BY DAY TIME GOETH ROUND ABOUT THEE WITH HIS SHEARS WITH YOU WHICH ROME WAS FIRST TO TOLERATE
FROM UTTERING OF THE AVE TILL THE BIRTH IN WHICH MY MOTHER WHO IS NOW A SAINT OF ME WAS LIGHTENED WHO HAD BEEN HER BURDEN
WELL WAS I WARE THAT I WAS MORE UPLIFTED BY THE ENKINDLED SMILING OF THE STAR THAT SEEMED TO ME MORE RUDDY THAN ITS WONT WITH ALL MY HEART AND IN THAT DIALECT WHICH IS THE SAME IN ALL SUCH HOLOCAUST TO GOD I MADE AS THE NEW GRACE BESEEMED
FROM WHICH SHE TAKETH STILL HER TIERCE AND NONES ABODE IN QUIET TEMPERATE AND CHASTE NO GOLDEN CHAIN SHE HAD NOR CORONAL NOR LADIES SHOD WITH SANDAL SHOON NOR GIRDLE THAT CAUGHT THE EYE MORE THAN THE PERSON DID
THE STOCK FROM WHICH WERE THE CALFUCCI BORN WAS GREAT ALREADY AND ALREADY CHOSEN TO CURULE CHAIRS THE SIZII AND ARRIGUCCI O HOW BEHELD I THOSE WHO ARE UNDONE BY THEIR OWN PRIDE AND HOW THE BALLS OF GOLD FLORENCE ENFLOWERED IN ALL THEIR MIGHTY DEEDS
BUT WHO BETHINKS HIM THAT THE LIVING SEALS OF EVERY BEAUTY GROW IN POWER ASCENDING AND THAT I THERE HAD NOT TURNED ROUND TO THOSE CAN ME EXCUSE IF I MYSELF ACCUSE TO EXCUSE MYSELF AND SEE THAT I SPEAK TRULY FOR HERE THE HOLY JOY IS NOT DISCLOSED
WHEN JUNO TO HER HANDMAID GIVES COMMAND THE ONE WITHOUT BORN OF THE ONE WITHIN LIKE TO THE SPEAKING OF THAT VAGRANT ONE WHOM LOVE CONSUMED AS DOTH THE SUN THE VAPOURS
SILENT AND WAKEFUL MANY A TIME WAS HE DISCOVERED BY HIS NURSE UPON THE GROUND AS IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID FOR THIS I CAME O THOU HIS FATHER FELIX VERILY O THOU HIS MOTHER VERILY JOANNA IF THIS INTERPRETED MEANS AS IS SAID
AND WHEN THE BOW OF BURNING SYMPATHY WAS SO FAR SLACKENED THAT ITS SPEECH DESCENDED TOWARDS THE MARK OF OUR INTELLIGENCE THE FIRST THING THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY ME WAS BENEDIGHT BE THOU O TRINE AND ONE
I FOLLOWED IN HIS TRAIN AGAINST THAT LAW'S INIQUITY WHOSE PEOPLE DOTH USURP YOUR JUST POSSESSION THROUGH YOUR PASTOR'S FAULT THERE BY THAT EXECRABLE RACE WAS I RELEASED FROM BONDS OF THE FALLACIOUS WORLD
BUT STILL THE ORBIT WHICH THE HIGHEST PART OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE MADE IS DERELICT SO THAT THE MOULD IS WHERE WAS ONCE THE CRUST HIS FAMILY THAT HAD STRAIGHT FORWARD MOVED WITH FEET UPON HIS FOOTPRINTS ARE TURNED ROUND SO THAT THEY SET THE POINT UPON THE HEEL
AND NOT YET FROM MY BOSOM WAS EXHAUSTED THE ARDOUR OF SACRIFICE BEFORE I KNEW THIS OFFERING WAS ACCEPTED AND AUSPICIOUS FOR WITH SO GREAT A LUSTRE AND SO RED SPLENDOURS APPEARED TO ME IN TWOFOLD RAYS I SAID O HELIOS WHO DOST SO ADORN THEM
AND IN ITS GYRE HAD NOT TURNED WHOLLY ROUND BEFORE ANOTHER IN A RING ENCLOSED IT AND MOTION JOINED TO MOTION SONG TO SONG SONG THAT AS GREATLY DOTH TRANSCEND OUR MUSES OUR SIRENS IN THOSE DULCET CLARIONS AS PRIMAL SPLENDOUR THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED
ANOTHER DRAWING TRESSES FROM HER DISTAFF TOLD O'ER AMONG HER FAMILY THE TALES OF TROJANS AND OF FESOLE AND ROME AS GREAT A MARVEL THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD A LAPO SALTERELLO
NOT YET THE DAUGHTER AT HER BIRTH STRUCK FEAR INTO THE FATHER FOR THE TIME AND DOWER DID NOT O'ERRUN THIS SIDE OR THAT THE MEASURE NO HOUSES HAD SHE VOID OF FAMILIES NOT YET HAD THITHER COME SARDANAPALUS TO SHOW WHAT IN A CHAMBER CAN BE DONE
IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
DOMINIC WAS HE CALLED AND HIM I SPEAK OF EVEN AS OF THE HUSBANDMAN WHOM CHRIST ELECTED TO HIS GARDEN TO ASSIST HIM ENVOY AND SERVANT SOOTH HE SEEMED OF CHRIST FOR THE FIRST LOVE MADE MANIFEST IN HIM WAS THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT WAS GIVEN BY CHRIST
NOR CAN SO GREAT A SPLENDOUR WEARY US FOR STRONG WILL BE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY TO EVERYTHING WHICH HATH THE POWER TO PLEASE US SO SUDDEN AND ALERT APPEARED TO ME BOTH ONE AND THE OTHER CHOIR TO SAY AMEN THAT WELL THEY SHOWED DESIRE FOR THEIR DEAD BODIES
FOR WILL INCREASE WHATE'ER BESTOWS ON US OF LIGHT GRATUITOUS THE GOOD SUPREME LIGHT WHICH ENABLES US TO LOOK ON HIM THEREFORE THE VISION MUST PERFORCE INCREASE INCREASE THE ARDOUR WHICH FROM THAT IS KINDLED INCREASE THE RADIANCE WHICH FROM THIS PROCEEDS
IF LUNI THOU REGARD AND URBISAGLIA HOW THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY AND HOW ARE PASSING CHIUSI AND SINIGAGLIA AFTER THEM TO HEAR HOW RACES WASTE THEMSELVES AWAY WILL SEEM TO THEE NO NOVEL THING NOR HARD
AS AT THE BLOWING OF THE WINDS A COAL QUICKENS TO FLAME SO I BEHELD THAT LIGHT BECOME RESPLENDENT AT MY BLANDISHMENTS AND AS UNTO MINE EYES IT GREW MORE FAIR WITH VOICE MORE SWEET AND TENDER BUT NOT IN THIS MODERN DIALECT IT SAID TO ME
BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHENCE THEY THITHER CAME SILENCE IS MORE CONSIDERATE THAN SPEECH ALL THOSE WHO AT THAT TIME WERE THERE BETWEEN MARS AND THE BAPTIST FIT FOR BEARING ARMS WERE A FIFTH PART OF THOSE WHO NOW ARE LIVING BUT THE COMMUNITY THAT NOW IS MIXED
FOR I HAVE SEEN ALL WINTER LONG THE THORN FIRST SHOW ITSELF INTRACTABLE AND FIERCE AND AFTER BEAR THE ROSE UPON ITS TOP AND I HAVE SEEN A SHIP DIRECT AND SWIFT RUN O'ER THE SEA THROUGHOUT ITS COURSE ENTIRE TO PERISH AT THE HARBOUR'S MOUTH AT LAST
OUT OF THE HEART OF ONE OF THE NEW LIGHTS THERE CAME A VOICE THAT NEEDLE TO THE STAR MADE ME APPEAR IN TURNING THITHERWARD AND IT BEGAN THE LOVE THAT MAKES ME FAIR DRAWS ME TO SPEAK ABOUT THE OTHER LEADER BY WHOM SO WELL IS SPOKEN HERE OF MINE
THAT HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND DOTH TIGHTEN AND RELAX HOW UNTO JUST ENTREATIES SHALL BE DEAF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH TO GIVE ME DESIRE OF PRAYING THEM WITH ONE ACCORD GREW SILENT TIS WELL THAT WITHOUT END HE SHOULD LAMENT
THUS DID SABELLIUS ARIUS AND THOSE FOOLS WHO HAVE BEEN EVEN AS SWORDS UNTO THE SCRIPTURES IN RENDERING DISTORTED THEIR STRAIGHT FACES NOR YET SHALL PEOPLE BE TOO CONFIDENT IN JUDGING EVEN AS HE IS WHO DOTH COUNT THE CORN IN FIELD OR EVER IT BE RIPE
AS CINCINNATUS OR CORNELIA NOW TO SUCH A QUIET SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE OF THE CITIZEN TO SUCH A SAFE COMMUNITY AND TO SO SWEET AN INN DID MARY GIVE ME WITH LOUD CRIES INVOKED AND IN YOUR ANCIENT BAPTISTERY AT ONCE CHRISTIAN AND CACCIAGUIDA I BECAME
O THOU OUR POOR NOBILITY OF BLOOD IF THOU DOST MAKE THE PEOPLE GLORY IN THEE DOWN HERE WHERE OUR AFFECTION LANGUISHES A MARVELLOUS THING IT NE'ER WILL BE TO ME FOR THERE WHERE APPETITE IS NOT PERVERTED
WHO ALWAYS IN GREAT OFFICES POSTPONED CONSIDERATIONS SINISTER HERE ARE ILLUMINATO AND AGOSTINO WHO OF THE FIRST BAREFOOTED BEGGARS WERE THAT WITH THE CORD THE FRIENDS OF GOD BECAME HUGH OF SAINT VICTOR IS AMONG THEM HERE
SO THAT THE SIGHT SEEMS REAL AND UNREAL IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NEW SUBSISTENCES BEGAN THERE TO BE SEEN AND MAKE A CIRCLE OUTSIDE THE OTHER TWO CIRCUMFERENCES O VERY SPARKLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HOW SUDDEN AND INCANDESCENT IT BECAME UNTO MINE EYES THAT VANQUISHED BORE IT NOT
SO LIKEWISE DID THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE WHO EVERMORE WHEN VACANT IS YOUR CHURCH FATTEN BY STAYING IN CONSISTORY THE INSOLENT RACE THAT LIKE A DRAGON FOLLOWS WHOEVER FLEES AND UNTO HIM THAT SHOWS HIS TEETH OR PURSE IS GENTLE AS A LAMB
BY GRACE OF HER WHO TO THIS LOFTY FLIGHT WITH PLUMAGE CLOTHED THEE THOU THINKEST THAT TO ME THY THOUGHT DOTH PASS FROM HIM WHO IS THE FIRST AS FROM THE UNIT IF THAT BE KNOWN RAY OUT THE FIVE AND SIX AND THEREFORE
IN THE LIKE MANNER WORKING AS THE ARTIST WHO HAS THE SKILL OF ART AND HAND THAT TREMBLES IF THEN THE FERVENT LOVE THE VISION CLEAR OF PRIMAL VIRTUE DO DISPOSE AND SEAL PERFECTION ABSOLUTE IS THERE ACQUIRED
HERE DOTH MY MEMORY OVERCOME MY GENIUS FOR ON THAT CROSS AS LEVIN GLEAMED FORTH CHRIST SO THAT I CANNOT FIND ENSAMPLE WORTHY BUT HE WHO TAKES HIS CROSS AND FOLLOWS CHRIST AGAIN WILL PARDON ME WHAT I OMIT SEEING IN THAT AURORA LIGHTEN CHRIST
NOR SOLE FOR THEM PERHAPS BUT FOR THE MOTHERS THE FATHERS AND THE REST WHO HAD BEEN DEAR OR EVER THEY BECAME ETERNAL FLAMES AND LO ALL ROUND ABOUT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AROSE A LUSTRE OVER WHAT WAS THERE LIKE AN HORIZON THAT IS CLEARING UP
THEN TELL ME MY BELOVED ROOT ANCESTRAL WHO WERE YOUR ANCESTORS AND WHAT THE YEARS THAT IN YOUR BOYHOOD CHRONICLED THEMSELVES TELL ME ABOUT THE SHEEPFOLD OF SAINT JOHN HOW LARGE IT WAS AND WHO THE PEOPLE WERE WITHIN IT WORTHY OF THE HIGHEST SEATS
AND IN AMONG THE SHOOTS HERETICAL HIS IMPETUS WITH GREATER FURY SMOTE WHEREVER THE RESISTANCE WAS THE GREATEST OF HIM WERE MADE THEREAFTER DIVERS RUNNELS WHEREBY THE GARDEN CATHOLIC IS WATERED SO THAT MORE LIVING ITS PLANTATIONS STAND
AND I BEGAN YOU ARE MY ANCESTOR YOU GIVE TO ME ALL HARDIHOOD TO SPEAK YOU LIFT ME SO THAT I AM MORE THAN I SO MANY RIVULETS WITH GLADNESS FILL MY MIND THAT OF ITSELF IT MAKES A JOY BECAUSE IT CAN ENDURE THIS AND NOT BURST
MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
WHEN I NARRATED THAT NO SECOND HAD THE GOOD WHICH IN THE FIFTH LIGHT IS ENCLOSED NOW OPE THINE EYES TO WHAT I ANSWER THEE AND THOU SHALT SEE THY CREED AND MY DISCOURSE FIT IN THE TRUTH AS CENTRE IN A CIRCLE THAT WHICH CAN DIE
AFTER THE DANCE AND OTHER GRAND REJOICINGS BOTH OF THE SINGING AND THE FLAMING FORTH EFFULGENCE WITH EFFULGENCE BLITHE AND TENDER TOGETHER AT ONCE WITH ONE ACCORD HAD STOPPED EVEN AS THE EYES THAT AS VOLITION MOVES THEM MUST NEEDS TOGETHER SHUT AND LIFT THEMSELVES
BUT THAT THE SACRED LOVE IN WHICH I WATCH WITH SIGHT PERPETUAL AND WHICH MAKES ME THIRST WITH SWEET DESIRE MAY BETTER BE FULFILLED NOW LET THY VOICE SECURE AND FRANK AND GLAD PROCLAIM THE WISHES THE DESIRE PROCLAIM TO WHICH MY ANSWER IS DECREED ALREADY
NOT THROUGH ITSELF BUT HIM WHO SITS THERE AND DEGENERATES NOT TO DISPENSE OR TWO OR THREE FOR SIX NOT ANY FORTUNE OF FIRST VACANCY NON DECIMAS QUAE SUNT PAUPERUM DEI
OF THE SAME WEIGHT FOR EACH OF YOU BECAME FOR IN THE SUN WHICH LIGHTED YOU AND BURNED WITH HEAT AND RADIANCE THEY SO EQUAL ARE THAT ALL SIMILITUDES ARE INSUFFICIENT BUT AMONG MORTALS WILL AND ARGUMENT FOR REASON THAT TO YOU IS MANIFEST
IN THE LIKE MANNER FORTUNE DOES WITH FLORENCE THEREFORE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A MARVELLOUS THING WHAT I SHALL SAY OF THE GREAT FLORENTINES OF WHOM THE FAME IS HIDDEN IN THE PAST I SAW THE UGHI
WHEREIN HER FAMILY LESS PERSEVERES YET ONCE AGAIN MY WORDS BEGINNING MADE WHENCE BEATRICE WHO STOOD SOMEWHAT APART SMILING APPEARED LIKE UNTO HER WHO COUGHED
ALREADY RISING WAS BUT FROM LOW PEOPLE SO THAT IT PLEASED NOT UBERTIN DONATO THAT HIS WIFE'S FATHER SHOULD MAKE HIM THEIR KIN ALREADY HAD CAPONSACCO TO THE MARKET FROM FESOLE DESCENDED AND ALREADY GIUDA AND INFANGATO WERE GOOD BURGHERS
WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE SWEET WEST WIND RISES TO OPEN THE NEW LEAVES WHEREWITH EUROPE IS SEEN TO CLOTHE HERSELF AFRESH NOT FAR OFF FROM THE BEATING OF THE WAVES BEHIND WHICH IN HIS LONG CAREER THE SUN SOMETIMES CONCEALS HIMSELF FROM EVERY MAN
LET HIM IMAGINE WHO WOULD WELL CONCEIVE WHAT NOW I SAW AND LET HIM WHILE I SPEAK RETAIN THE IMAGE AS A STEADFAST ROCK THE FIFTEEN STARS THAT IN THEIR DIVERS REGIONS THE SKY ENLIVEN WITH A LIGHT SO GREAT
AND THE GOOD ARE RARE WITH THIS DISTINCTION TAKE THOU WHAT I SAID AND THUS IT CAN CONSIST WITH THY BELIEF OF THE FIRST FATHER AND OF OUR DELIGHT AND LEAD SHALL THIS BE ALWAYS TO THY FEET TO MAKE THEE LIKE A WEARY MAN MOVE SLOWLY
OR IF IN SEMICIRCLE CAN BE MADE TRIANGLE SO THAT IT HAVE NO RIGHT ANGLE WHENCE IF THOU NOTEST THIS AND WHAT I SAID A REGAL PRUDENCE IS THAT PEERLESS SEEING IN WHICH THE SHAFT OF MY INTENTION STRIKES AND IF ON ROSE THOU TURNEST THY CLEAR EYES
BOTH TO THE YES AND NO THOU SEEST NOT FOR VERY LOW AMONG THE FOOLS IS HE WHO AFFIRMS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OR DENIES AS WELL IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS THAT FULL OFTEN BENDS CURRENT OPINION IN THE FALSE DIRECTION
AND PETER MANGIADOR AND PETER OF SPAIN WHO DOWN BELOW IN VOLUMES TWELVE IS SHINING NATHAN THE SEER AND METROPOLITAN CHRYSOSTOM
THE BUONDELMONTI EVER THE INTERMINGLING OF THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MALADY IN CITIES AS IN THE BODY FOOD IT SURFEITS ON AND A BLIND BULL MORE HEADLONG PLUNGES DOWN THAN A BLIND LAMB AND VERY OFTEN CUTS BETTER AND MORE A SINGLE SWORD THAN FIVE
TIS RIGHT WHERE ONE IS TO BRING IN THE OTHER THAT AS THEY WERE UNITED IN THEIR WARFARE TOGETHER LIKEWISE MAY THEIR GLORY SHINE THE SOLDIERY OF CHRIST WHICH IT HAD COST SO DEAR TO ARM AGAIN BEHIND THE STANDARD MOVED SLOW AND DOUBTFUL AND IN NUMBERS FEW
THEN PLEASANT TO THE HEARING AND THE SIGHT THE SPIRIT JOINED TO ITS BEGINNING THINGS I UNDERSTOOD NOT SO PROFOUND IT SPAKE NOR DID IT HIDE ITSELF FROM ME BY CHOICE BUT BY NECESSITY FOR ITS CONCEPTION ABOVE THE MARK OF MORTALS SET ITSELF
DIVERSELY FEATHERED IN THEIR PINIONS ARE WHENCE I WHO MORTAL AM FEEL IN MYSELF THIS INEQUALITY SO GIVE NOT THANKS SAVE IN MY HEART FOR THIS PATERNAL WELCOME TRULY DO I ENTREAT THEE LIVING TOPAZ SET IN THIS PRECIOUS JEWEL AS A GEM
WHICH THE HEAVEN PRODUCES BY ITS OWN MOTION WITH SEED AND WITHOUT NEITHER THEIR WAX NOR THAT WHICH TEMPERS IT REMAINS IMMUTABLE AND HENCE BENEATH THE IDEAL SIGNET MORE AND LESS SHINES THROUGH THEREFORE IT HAPPENS THAT THE SELFSAME TREE
I'LL TELL A THING INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE ONE ENTERED THE SMALL CIRCUIT BY A GATE WHICH FROM THE DELLA PERA TOOK ITS NAME EACH ONE THAT BEARS THE BEAUTIFUL ESCUTCHEON OF THE GREAT BARON WHOSE RENOWN AND NAME THE FESTIVAL OF THOMAS KEEPETH FRESH
AND WHO A HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE HAS CIRCLED ROUND THE MOUNT ON THE FIRST CORNICE A SON OF MINE AND THY GREAT GRANDSIRE WAS WELL IT BEHOVES THEE THAT THE LONG FATIGUE THOU SHOULDST FOR HIM MAKE SHORTER WITH THY WORKS FLORENCE WITHIN THE ANCIENT BOUNDARY
HERE IS RABANUS AND BESIDE ME HERE SHINES THE CALABRIAN ABBOT JOACHIM HE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ENDOWED TO CELEBRATE SO GREAT A PALADIN HAVE MOVED ME THE IMPASSIONED COURTESY AND THE DISCREET DISCOURSES OF FRIAR THOMAS
WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES AND OTHERS WITH THEM FLORENCE BEHELD I IN SO GREAT REPOSE THAT NO OCCASION HAD SHE WHENCE TO WEEP
NOT FOR THE WORLD WHICH PEOPLE TOIL FOR NOW IN FOLLOWING OSTIENSE AND TADDEO BUT THROUGH HIS LONGING AFTER THE TRUE MANNA HE IN SHORT TIME BECAME SO GREAT A TEACHER THAT HE BEGAN TO GO ABOUT THE VINEYARD WHICH FADETH SOON IF FAITHLESS BE THE DRESSER
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THIRTY MORE TO REINFLAME ITSELF BENEATH HIS PAW MY ANCESTORS AND I OUR BIRTHPLACE HAD WHERE FIRST IS FOUND THE LAST WARD OF THE CITY BY HIM WHO RUNNETH IN YOUR ANNUAL GAME SUFFICE IT OF MY ELDERS TO HEAR THIS
IN WHICH THE HOLY CHURCH ITSELF DEFENDED AND IN THE FIELD ITS CIVIC BATTLE WON TRULY FULL MANIFEST SHOULD BE TO THEE THE EXCELLENCE OF THE OTHER UNTO WHOM THOMAS SO COURTEOUS WAS BEFORE MY COMING
SEEING THAT EVEN CITIES HAVE AN END ALL THINGS OF YOURS HAVE THEIR MORTALITY EVEN AS YOURSELVES BUT IT IS HIDDEN IN SOME THAT A LONG WHILE ENDURE AND LIVES ARE SHORT AND AS THE TURNING OF THE LUNAR HEAVEN COVERS AND BARES THE SHORES WITHOUT A PAUSE
WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT DOTH NOT LAST ETERNALLY DESPOILS HIM OF THAT LOVE AS THROUGH THE PURE AND TRANQUIL EVENING AIR THERE SHOOTS FROM TIME TO TIME A SUDDEN FIRE MOVING THE EYES THAT STEADFAST WERE BEFORE
AFTER ITS KIND BEARS WORSE AND BETTER FRUIT AND YE ARE BORN WITH CHARACTERS DIVERSE IF IN PERFECTION TEMPERED WERE THE WAX AND WERE THE HEAVEN IN ITS SUPREMEST VIRTUE THE BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAL WOULD ALL APPEAR BUT NATURE GIVES IT EVERMORE DEFICIENT
THINK WHO HE WAS AND WHAT OCCASION MOVED HIM TO MAKE REQUEST WHEN IT WAS TOLD HIM ASK I'VE NOT SO SPOKEN THAT THOU CANST NOT SEE CLEARLY HE WAS A KING WHO ASKED FOR WISDOM THAT HE MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY A KING TWAS NOT TO KNOW THE NUMBER IN WHICH ARE THE MOTORS HERE ABOVE
SO FROM THE LIGHTS THAT THERE TO ME APPEARED UPGATHERED THROUGH THE CROSS A MELODY WHICH RAPT ME NOT DISTINGUISHING THE HYMN WELL WAS I WARE IT WAS OF LOFTY LAUD BECAUSE THERE CAME TO ME ARISE AND CONQUER AS UNTO HIM WHO HEARS AND COMPREHENDS NOT
EVEN IN THEIR FALL ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS AND SAW AS MIGHTY AS THEY ANCIENT WERE WITH HIM OF LA SANNELLA HIM OF ARCA AND SOLDANIER ARDINGHI AND BOSTICHI NEAR TO THE GATE THAT IS AT PRESENT LADEN WITH A NEW FELONY OF SO MUCH WEIGHT
AND FROM THE MIRROR HIS DAME DEPART WITHOUT A PAINTED FACE AND HIM OF NERLI SAW AND HIM OF VECCHIO CONTENTED WITH THEIR SIMPLE SUITS OF BUFF AND WITH THE SPINDLE AND THE FLAX THEIR DAMES O FORTUNATE WOMEN
MORONTO WAS MY BROTHER AND ELISEO FROM VAL DI PADO CAME TO ME MY WIFE AND FROM THAT PLACE THY SURNAME WAS DERIVED I FOLLOWED AFTERWARD THE EMPEROR CONRAD AND HE BEGIRT ME OF HIS CHIVALRY SO MUCH I PLEASED HIM WITH MY NOBLE DEEDS
SO MUCH ENAMOURED I BECAME THEREWITH THAT UNTIL THEN THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING THAT E'ER HAD FETTERED ME WITH SUCH SWEET BONDS PERHAPS MY WORD APPEARS SOMEWHAT TOO BOLD POSTPONING THE DELIGHT OF THOSE FAIR EYES INTO WHICH GAZING MY DESIRE HAS REST
AND THEN THE FEELINGS BIND THE INTELLECT FAR MORE THAN USELESSLY HE LEAVES THE SHORE SINCE HE RETURNETH NOT THE SAME HE WENT WHO FISHES FOR THE TRUTH AND HAS NO SKILL
THE MOMENT WHEN SHE FELT THE FROST OF DEATH AND ONE TO HAVE ITS RAYS WITHIN THE OTHER AND BOTH TO WHIRL THEMSELVES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE SHOULD FORWARD GO THE OTHER BACKWARD
AND THAT WHICH DIETH NOT ARE NOTHING BUT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE IDEA WHICH BY HIS LOVE OUR LORD BRINGS INTO BEING BECAUSE THAT LIVING LIGHT WHICH FROM ITS FOUNT EFFULGENT FLOWS SO THAT IT DISUNITES NOT FROM HIM NOR FROM THE LOVE IN THEM INTRINED
KNIGHTHOOD AND PRIVILEGE FROM HIM RECEIVED THOUGH WITH THE POPULACE UNITES HIMSELF TO DAY THE MAN WHO BINDS IT WITH A BORDER ALREADY WERE GUALTEROTTI AND IMPORTUNI AND STILL MORE QUIET WOULD THE BORGO BE IF WITH NEW NEIGHBOURS IT REMAINED UNFED
SO THAT FIRE SEEMED IT BEHIND ALABASTER THUS PITEOUS DID ANCHISES SHADE REACH FORWARD IF ANY FAITH OUR GREATEST MUSE DESERVE WHEN IN ELYSIUM HE HIS SON PERCEIVED
AND SEEMS TO BE A STAR THAT CHANGETH PLACE EXCEPT THAT IN THE PART WHERE IT IS KINDLED NOTHING IS MISSED AND THIS ENDURETH LITTLE SO FROM THE HORN THAT TO THE RIGHT EXTENDS UNTO THAT CROSS'S FOOT THERE RAN A STAR OUT OF THE CONSTELLATION SHINING THERE
WHICH SURPASSED SHALL IN ITS DOWNFALL BE AS IN ITS RISE
THAT IN THE POINT BEGINNETH OF THE AXIS ROUND ABOUT WHICH THE PRIMAL WHEEL REVOLVES TO HAVE FASHIONED OF THEMSELVES TWO SIGNS IN HEAVEN
AND HIM OF SIGNA WHO HAS SHARP EYES FOR TRICKERY ALREADY HAD NOT THE FOLK WHICH MOST OF ALL THE WORLD DEGENERATES BEEN A STEP DAME UNTO CAESAR
A WILL BENIGN IN WHICH REVEALS ITSELF EVER THE LOVE THAT RIGHTEOUSLY INSPIRES AS IN THE INIQUITOUS CUPIDITY SILENCE IMPOSED UPON THAT DULCET LYRE AND QUIETED THE CONSECRATED CHORDS
THIS MAN HAS NEED AND DOES NOT TELL YOU SO NOR WITH THE VOICE NOR EVEN IN HIS THOUGHT OF GOING TO THE ROOT OF ONE TRUTH MORE DECLARE UNTO HIM IF THE LIGHT WHEREWITH BLOSSOMS YOUR SUBSTANCE SHALL REMAIN WITH YOU ETERNALLY THE SAME THAT IT IS NOW
AND WHEN IT WAS CREATED WAS HIS MIND REPLETE WITH SUCH A LIVING ENERGY THAT IN HIS MOTHER HER IT MADE PROPHETIC AS SOON AS THE ESPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE BETWEEN HIM AND THE FAITH AT HOLY FONT WHERE THEY WITH MUTUAL SAFETY DOWERED EACH OTHER
HE ASKED FOR BUT AGAINST THE ERRANT WORLD PERMISSION TO DO BATTLE FOR THE SEED OF WHICH THESE FOUR AND TWENTY PLANTS SURROUND THEE THEN WITH THE DOCTRINE AND THE WILL TOGETHER WITH OFFICE APOSTOLICAL HE MOVED LIKE TORRENT WHICH SOME LOFTY VEIN OUT PRESSES
ITS BRIGHTNESS IS PROPORTIONED TO THE ARDOUR THE ARDOUR TO THE VISION AND THE VISION EQUALS WHAT GRACE IT HAS ABOVE ITS WORTH WHEN GLORIOUS AND SANCTIFIED OUR FLESH IS REASSUMED THEN SHALL OUR PERSONS BE MORE PLEASING BY THEIR BEING ALL COMPLETE
EVEN AS DISTINCT WITH LESS AND GREATER LIGHTS GLIMMERS BETWEEN THE TWO POLES OF THE WORLD THE GALAXY THAT MAKETH WISE MEN DOUBT THUS CONSTELLATED IN THE DEPTHS OF MARS THOSE RAYS DESCRIBED THE VENERABLE SIGN THAT QUADRANTS JOINING IN A CIRCLE MAKE
ITSELF ETERNALLY REMAINING ONE THENCE IT DESCENDS TO THE LAST POTENCIES DOWNWARD FROM ACT TO ACT BECOMING SUCH THAT ONLY BRIEF CONTINGENCIES IT MAKES AND THESE CONTINGENCIES I HOLD TO BE THINGS GENERATED
WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN WAS SHE HANDSOME WAS THERE ANY PICTURE OF HER IN THE ABBEY
ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
YES THESE WERE CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS THEY BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION A COUNTLESS VARIETY OF DREADFUL SITUATIONS AND HORRID SCENES WHICH SUCH BUILDINGS HAD WITNESSED AND SUCH STORMS USHERED IN
IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR AND THEN EXPRESSING HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE TEA HOUSE PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK IF MISS MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED
TO RETIRE TO BED HOWEVER UNSATISFIED ON SUCH A POINT WOULD BE VAIN SINCE SLEEP MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CABINET SO MYSTERIOUSLY CLOSED IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY AGAIN THEREFORE SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KEY
AND SO DESPERATE SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH THAT UNLESS SECURED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK WITH THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO ENTER HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY AND MORE THAN ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS
IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
HE TRUSTED HOWEVER THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ERE LONG OCCUR OF SELECTING ONE THOUGH NOT FOR HIMSELF CATHERINE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
AND CATHERINE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW MUCH HER SPIRITS WERE RELIEVED BY THE SEPARATION
HENRY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ONLY IN JEST IN WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER THAT MORNING IN A HOUSE SO FURNISHED AND SO GUARDED SHE COULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLORE OR TO SUFFER AND MIGHT GO TO HER BEDROOM AS SECURELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN CHAMBER AT FULLERTON
IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
THE WALLS WERE PAPERED THE FLOOR WAS CARPETED THE WINDOWS WERE NEITHER LESS PERFECT NOR MORE DIM THAN THOSE OF THE DRAWING ROOM BELOW THE FURNITURE THOUGH NOT OF THE LATEST FASHION WAS HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER FAR FROM UNCHEERFUL
AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MISSUS TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE
SOON AFTER HER DEATH I OBTAINED IT FOR MY OWN AND HUNG IT IN MY BED CHAMBER
HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
BUT IT WAS SO VERY ODD AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID IN SHORT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT SO PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON A CHAIR SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN IT BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH
THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
BROKEN PERHAPS PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE AND ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID WAS A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER IN THE SAME METAL CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY SHE COULD NOT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT
ADDED ELEANOR THOUGH I NEVER LOVED IT THEN AS I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE AT THAT TIME INDEED I USED TO WONDER AT HER CHOICE BUT HER MEMORY ENDEARS IT NOW AND OUGHT IT NOT REFLECTED CATHERINE TO ENDEAR IT TO HER HUSBAND YET THE GENERAL WOULD NOT ENTER IT
SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
AND FORCED HER IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY TO PROCEED IN HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK FOR HER THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED TO INTEREST AND ALARM AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON A SECOND ATTEMPT
AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
I THINK IT WOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE MOST IMPARTIAL EYE TO HAVE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THE HOUSE STANDS AMONG FINE MEADOWS FACING THE SOUTH EAST WITH AN EXCELLENT KITCHEN GARDEN IN THE SAME ASPECT
SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED TO HER HAND HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY
TO CLOSE HER EYES IN SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE FELT MUST BE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH A CURIOSITY SO JUSTLY AWAKENED AND FEELINGS IN EVERY WAY SO AGITATED REPOSE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THE STORM TOO ABROAD SO DREADFUL
HER PICTURE I SUPPOSE BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN QUESTION HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM NO IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING ROOM BUT MY FATHER WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE
I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
ENTERED THE ROOM AND TO THE RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH
HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
A VIOLENT GUST OF WIND RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED A SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR
HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE AND THOUGH THE LOVE OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC WHO CAN TELL THE SENTIMENT ONCE RAISED BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE
MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
AND YET UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD
A SMALL DOOR CLOSED ALSO WITH A LOCK AND KEY SECURED IN ALL PROBABILITY A CAVITY OF IMPORTANCE CATHERINE'S HEART BEAT QUICK BUT HER COURAGE DID NOT FAIL HER WITH A CHEEK FLUSHED BY HOPE AND AN EYE STRAINING WITH CURIOSITY
SHE WAS ENABLED ESPECIALLY ON PERCEIVING THAT MISS TILNEY SLEPT ONLY TWO DOORS FROM HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITH A TOLERABLY STOUT HEART AND HER SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY ASSISTED BY THE CHEERFUL BLAZE OF A WOOD FIRE
AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
SHE COULD NOT REMAIN MANY PACES FROM THE CHEST AT LENGTH HOWEVER HAVING SLIPPED ONE ARM INTO HER GOWN HER TOILETTE SEEMED SO NEARLY FINISHED THAT THE IMPATIENCE OF HER CURIOSITY MIGHT SAFELY BE INDULGED
AND SHE WAS PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE WHICH THE CHAISE SEAT HAD CONVEYED FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE HIGH CHEST STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START
WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
AND FITTED UP IN A STYLE OF LUXURY AND EXPENSE WHICH WAS ALMOST LOST ON THE UNPRACTISED EYE OF CATHERINE WHO SAW LITTLE MORE THAN ITS SPACIOUSNESS AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR ATTENDANTS OF THE FORMER SHE SPOKE ALOUD HER ADMIRATION AND THE GENERAL WITH A VERY GRACIOUS COUNTENANCE
AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
AND SAT PALE AND BREATHLESS IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN AND DETESTING OLD CHESTS AND THE GENERAL RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE LOOKED AT HER SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND
FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
BY WHAT MEANS COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO LONG CONCEALED AND HOW SINGULARLY STRANGE THAT IT SHOULD FALL TO HER LOT TO DISCOVER IT TILL SHE HAD MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF ITS CONTENTS HOWEVER SHE COULD HAVE NEITHER REPOSE NOR COMFORT AND WITH THE SUN'S FIRST RAYS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERUSE IT
THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
SAID MISS TILNEY AS CATHERINE HASTILY CLOSED IT AND TURNED AWAY TO THE GLASS
MAMMA SAYS I AM NEVER WITHIN
THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON IT IS A FAMILY LIVING MISS MORLAND AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING CHIEFLY MY OWN YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD ONE
TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON THIS POINT SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF ANYTHING AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY
AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
PUSHED BACK TOO AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT I WILL LOOK INTO IT COST ME WHAT IT MAY I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND DIRECTLY TOO BY DAYLIGHT IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT SHE ADVANCED AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY
THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH BETTER SIZED APARTMENTS AT MISTER ALLEN'S NO INDEED WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE MISTER ALLEN'S DINING PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE AND SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE
IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE APPEARANCE OF A HIGH OLD FASHIONED BLACK CABINET WHICH THOUGH IN A SITUATION CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH HAD NEVER CAUGHT HER NOTICE BEFORE HENRY'S WORDS HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE EBONY CABINET WHICH WAS TO ESCAPE HER OBSERVATION AT FIRST
NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
THE WALLS SEEMED COUNTLESS IN NUMBER ENDLESS IN LENGTH A VILLAGE OF HOT HOUSES SEEMED TO ARISE AMONG THEM AND A WHOLE PARISH TO BE AT WORK WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE THE GENERAL WAS FLATTERED BY HER LOOKS OF SURPRISE WHICH TOLD HIM ALMOST AS PLAINLY
BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE SHE STOOD GAZING ON IT IN MOTIONLESS WONDER WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HER
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION THE GENERAL WISHED HE COULD DO THE SAME
AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO TELL HIM IN WORDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO THEM BEFORE
AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
A LAMP COULD NOT HAVE EXPIRED WITH MORE AWFUL EFFECT CATHERINE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS MOTIONLESS WITH HORROR IT WAS DONE COMPLETELY NOT A REMNANT OF LIGHT IN THE WICK COULD GIVE HOPE TO THE REKINDLING BREATH DARKNESS IMPENETRABLE AND IMMOVABLE FILLED THE ROOM
BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG LADIES I AM SURE YOUR FATHER MISS MORLAND WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT THE MONEY IS NOTHING IT IS NOT AN OBJECT BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING
SHE SEIZED WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND THE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT
THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF BREATH FROM HASTE WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST OCCASION FOR HURRY IN THE WORLD
IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT AND HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE HER HEART FLUTTERED HER KNEES TREMBLED AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE
IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS AND CATHERINE STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT AND EAGER TO ENTER IT COULD NOT EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION BE KEPT FROM STEPPING FORWARD
STRUCK ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE A COLD SWEAT STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND AND GROPING HER WAY TO THE BED SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES
SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME
WAS EVERY MOMENT GROWING GREATER AND SEIZING WITH TREMBLING HANDS THE HASP OF THE LOCK SHE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO SATISFY HERSELF AT LEAST AS TO ITS CONTENTS WITH DIFFICULTY FOR SOMETHING SEEMED TO RESIST HER EFFORTS SHE RAISED THE LID A FEW INCHES
AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
THE WIND HAD BEEN RISING AT INTERVALS THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AND BY THE TIME THE PARTY BROKE UP IT BLEW AND RAINED VIOLENTLY CATHERINE AS SHE CROSSED THE HALL LISTENED TO THE TEMPEST WITH SENSATIONS OF AWE AND WHEN SHE HEARD IT RAGE ROUND A CORNER OF THE ANCIENT BUILDING AND CLOSE WITH SUDDEN FURY A DISTANT DOOR
BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING ELEANOR WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THAT COLD DAMP PATH TO IT MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET OUR BEST WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK
SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
HAS HIS PROFESSION THE IMPOSING EFFECT OF THIS LAST ARGUMENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS WISHES THE SILENCE OF THE LADY PROVED IT TO BE UNANSWERABLE SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID THE EVENING BEFORE OF HER BEING SHOWN OVER THE HOUSE AND HE NOW OFFERED HIMSELF AS HER CONDUCTOR
HE IS A HAPPY MAN SAID THE GENERAL WITH A LOOK OF VERY HAPPY CONTEMPT HAVING TAKEN HER INTO EVERY DIVISION AND LED HER UNDER EVERY WALL TILL SHE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF SEEING AND WONDERING
WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
OFFERED IT NO INJURY AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK WITH EASY GAIETY OF THE DELIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WHICH SUCH A GROVE INSPIRED I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS SPOT SAID HER COMPANION WITH A SIGH IT WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE WALK
THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
BUT IT WAS JAPAN BLACK AND YELLOW JAPAN OF THE HANDSOMEST KIND AND AS SHE HELD HER CANDLE THE YELLOW HAD VERY MUCH THE EFFECT OF GOLD THE KEY WAS IN THE DOOR AND SHE HAD A STRANGE FANCY TO LOOK INTO IT NOT HOWEVER WITH THE SMALLEST EXPECTATION OF FINDING ANYTHING
THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
IN COARSE AND MODERN CHARACTERS SEEMED ALL THAT WAS BEFORE HER IF THE EVIDENCE OF SIGHT MIGHT BE TRUSTED SHE HELD A WASHING BILL IN HER HAND SHE SEIZED ANOTHER SHEET AND SAW THE SAME ARTICLES WITH LITTLE VARIATION A THIRD A FOURTH AND A FIFTH PRESENTED NOTHING NEW
FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
THE GENERAL LISTENED WITH ASSENTING GRATITUDE AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS OWN ESTIMATION OF NORTHANGER HAD WAITED UNFIXED TILL THAT HOUR
SHE WAS HANDSOME SHE WAS VIGOROUS IN HER ANIMAL SPIRITS THERE WAS AN AFFLUENCE OF LIFE AND CERTAINTY OF FLOW SUCH AS EXCITED MY WONDER WHILE IT BAFFLED MY COMPREHENSION I COULD TALK A WHILE WHEN THE EVENING COMMENCED
LOOKED OUT OF A SMALL BUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE WOOD ONE DAY AND SAW DOROTHY STANDING A LITTLE WAY OFF HE DID NOT SCAMPER AWAY AS IS HIS CUSTOM BUT SAT VERY STILL AND MET THE GAZE OF HER SWEET EYES BOLDLY
YOU SEE WE HAVE ONLY OUR EYES AND OUR EARS AND OUR LEGS TO DEFEND OURSELVES WITH WE CANNOT FIGHT BUT WE CAN ALWAYS RUN AWAY AND THAT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO SAVE OUR LIVES THAN BY FIGHTING WHERE IS YOUR HOME BUNNY ENQUIRED THE GIRL
AND THEN SHE ROMPED AWAY TO THE FIELDS TO AMUSE HERSELF IN HER OWN WAY SHE CAME TO KNOW EVERY FLOWER THAT GREW AND TO CALL THEM BY NAME AND SHE ALWAYS STEPPED VERY CAREFULLY TO AVOID TREADING ON THEM FOR DOROTHY WAS A KIND HEARTED CHILD
THE NEXT CHRISTMAS WHEN I WATCHED BY THE ROAD SIDE TO SEE SANTA I WAS PLEASED TO NOTICE A GREAT MANY OF THE TOY RABBITS STICKING OUT OF THE LOADED SLEIGH THE BABIES MUST HAVE LIKED THEM TOO FOR EVERY YEAR SINCE I HAVE SEEN THEM AMONGST THE TOYS
THIS GREW TO FORCE COMPRESSED CONDENSED CONTROLLED THE HEART WAS THRILLED THE MIND ASTONISHED BY THE POWER OF THE PREACHER NEITHER WERE SOFTENED THROUGHOUT THERE WAS A STRANGE BITTERNESS AN ABSENCE OF CONSOLATORY GENTLENESS
FOR IT WAS ONE OF THE LOVELIEST PLACES YOU COULD IMAGINE IT STOOD ON THE TOP OF A HIGH MOUNTAIN AND IS BUILT OF GOLD AND SILVER BRICKS AND THE WINDOWS ARE PURE DIAMOND CRYSTALS
AND SO HE WENT SOFTLY UP TO THE PIG STY AND REACHED OVER AND GRABBED THE LITTLE PIG BY THE EARS THE PIG SQUEALED OF COURSE BUT THE FARMER WAS MAKING SO MUCH NOISE HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT HEAR IT
AND BEGAN TO MAKE A WHISTLE OUT OF THE PIG'S TAIL WITH HIS POCKET KNIFE NOW FARMER BOWSER WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAWING THE WOOD FOUND IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE PIG SO HE TOOK A PAIL OF MEAL AND WENT TO THE PIGSTY
WHEN I MEET AN ENEMY I RUN TO MY HOLE AND JUMP IN AND THERE I STAY UNTIL ALL DANGER IS OVER YOU HAVE TOLD ME WHAT YOU SEE IN SUMMER CONTINUED DOROTHY WHO WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE RABBIT'S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF
ZEALOUS AS HE WAS HAD NOT YET FOUND THAT PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING HE HAD NO MORE FOUND IT I THOUGHT THAN HAD I WITH MY CONCEALED AND RACKING REGRETS FOR MY BROKEN IDOL AND LOST ELYSIUM
IT WAS ONE MORNING AFTER CHRISTMAS SAID THE RABBIT WHO SEEMED TO ENJOY TALKING NOW THAT HE HAD OVERCOME HIS FEAR OF DOROTHY AND I WAS SITTING BY THE ROAD SIDE WHEN SANTA CLAUS CAME RIDING BACK IN HIS EMPTY SLEIGH HE DOES NOT COME HOME QUITE SO FAST AS HE GOES
SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS I WATCHED HIM MAKING ALL KINDS OF TOYS AND I WONDERED TO SEE HOW QUICKLY HE MADE THEM AND HOW MANY NEW THINGS HE INVENTED I ALMOST WISH I WAS A CHILD I SAID TO HIM ONE DAY FOR THEN I TOO COULD HAVE PLAYTHINGS
STERN ALLUSIONS TO CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ELECTION PREDESTINATION REPROBATION WERE FREQUENT AND EACH REFERENCE TO THESE POINTS SOUNDED LIKE A SENTENCE PRONOUNCED FOR DOOM
WHAT SHALL WE DO HE ASKED HIS FATHER GO HUNGRY REPLIED BARNEY UNLESS YOU WANT TO TAKE MY PIPES AND PLAY IN THE VILLAGE
SAY WHAT DO YOU SEE WITH YOUR BIG ROUND EYE ON CHRISTMAS WE RABBITS SAYS BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY LITTLE DOROTHY HAD PASSED ALL THE FEW YEARS OF HER LIFE IN THE COUNTRY
TOM THE PIPER'S SON
IT BEGAN CALM AND INDEED AS FAR AS DELIVERY AND PITCH OF VOICE WENT IT WAS CALM TO THE END AN EARNESTLY FELT YET STRICTLY RESTRAINED ZEAL BREATHED SOON IN THE DISTINCT ACCENTS AND PROMPTED THE NERVOUS LANGUAGE
HAD SPRUNG FROM A DEPTH WHERE LAY TURBID DREGS OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHERE MOVED TROUBLING IMPULSES OF INSATIATE YEARNINGS AND DISQUIETING ASPIRATIONS
ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT HE HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN FOR ME YET IT BECAME URGENT THAT I SHOULD HAVE A VOCATION OF SOME KIND ONE MORNING BEING LEFT ALONE WITH HIM A FEW MINUTES IN THE PARLOUR I VENTURED TO APPROACH THE WINDOW RECESS
THAN WHEN HE STOLE THE PIG TO GET A DINNER AND SUFFERED A SEVERE BEATING AS A PUNISHMENT
AS GOVERNESSES IN A LARGE FASHIONABLE SOUTH OF ENGLAND CITY WHERE EACH HELD A SITUATION IN FAMILIES
BUT NO TRACES OF THE PIG COULD HE FIND ANYWHERE AND THAT WAS NO GREAT WONDER FOR THE PIG WAS EATEN BY THAT TIME AND ITS BONES PICKED CLEAN FINALLY THE FARMER CAME TO THE END OF THE STREET WHERE THE PIPER LIVED IN HIS LITTLE HUT
NO ANSWERED TOM SHAKING HIS HEAD NO ONE WILL GIVE ME A PENNY FOR PLAYING
BUT THERE WAS MORE OF GLOOM THAN PLEASURE IN THE TONE AND WORDS IN WHICH THE SENTIMENT WAS MANIFESTED AND NEVER DID HE SEEM TO ROAM THE MOORS FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR SOOTHING SILENCE NEVER SEEK OUT OR DWELL UPON THE THOUSAND PEACEFUL DELIGHTS THEY COULD YIELD
SO AFTER MOTHER HUBBARD HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD MEAL OF TURNIPS AND SLICED CABBAGE SANTA CLAUS PUT THE MAGIC COLLAR AROUND MY NECK AND I STARTED FOR HOME I TOOK MY TIME ON THE JOURNEY FOR I KNEW NOTHING COULD HARM ME
AND THEN HE STUFFED THE FUR FULL OF SAWDUST AND SEWED IT UP NEATLY AFTER WHICH HE PUT IN SOME GLASS EYES THAT MADE THE TOY RABBIT LOOK WONDERFULLY LIFE LIKE WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE HE PUT IT ON THE TABLE BESIDE ME
I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIM NOR OF HIS REINDEER AND IT IS SUCH FUN TO SEE HIM COME DASHING ALONG CRACKING HIS WHIP AND CALLING OUT CHEERILY TO HIS REINDEER WHO ARE ABLE TO RUN EVEN SWIFTER THAN WE RABBITS
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE PIPER HAD THE PIG KILLED AND CUT INTO PIECES AND BOILING IN THE POT ONLY THE TAIL WAS LEFT OUT FOR TOM WANTED TO MAKE A WHISTLE OF IT AND AS THERE WAS PLENTY TO EAT BESIDES THE TAIL HIS FATHER LET HIM HAVE IT
OUR NATURES DOVETAILED MUTUAL AFFECTION OF THE STRONGEST KIND WAS THE RESULT THEY DISCOVERED I COULD DRAW THEIR PENCILS AND COLOUR BOXES WERE IMMEDIATELY AT MY SERVICE MY SKILL GREATER IN THIS ONE POINT THAN THEIRS SURPRISED AND CHARMED THEM
IN A FEW DAYS I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED MY HEALTH THAT I COULD SIT UP ALL DAY AND WALK OUT SOMETIMES I COULD JOIN WITH DIANA AND MARY IN ALL THEIR OCCUPATIONS CONVERSE WITH THEM AS MUCH AS THEY WISHED
ZEALOUS IN HIS MINISTERIAL LABOURS BLAMELESS IN HIS LIFE AND HABITS HE YET DID NOT APPEAR TO ENJOY THAT MENTAL SERENITY THAT INWARD CONTENT WHICH SHOULD BE THE REWARD OF EVERY SINCERE CHRISTIAN AND PRACTICAL PHILANTHROPIST
CAME THE STRAP OVER TOM'S BACK OW OW CRIED THE BOY AND STARTED TO RUN DOWN THE STREET WHACK WHACK FELL THE STRAP OVER HIS SHOULDER FOR THE FARMER FOLLOWED AT HIS HEELS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET
I LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY LIKED TO READ WHAT THEY ENJOYED DELIGHTED ME WHAT THEY APPROVED I REVERENCED THEY LOVED THEIR SEQUESTERED HOME I TOO IN THE GREY SMALL ANTIQUE STRUCTURE
AND WHEN HE HAD LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY HE CRIED OUT THIS TAIL BELONGED TO MY LITTLE PIG FOR I KNOW VERY WELL THE CURL AT THE END OF IT TELL ME YOU RASCAL WHERE IS THE PIG THEN TOM FELL IN A TREMBLE FOR HE KNEW HIS WICKEDNESS WAS DISCOVERED
I MUST PUT A SQUEAK IN IT SAID SANTA SO HE TOOK A BOX OF SQUEAKS FROM A SHELF AND PUT ONE INTO THE RABBIT BEFORE HE SEWED IT UP WHEN IT WAS ALL FINISHED HE PRESSED THE TOY RABBIT WITH HIS THUMB AND IT SQUEAKED SO NATURALLY THAT I JUMPED OFF THE TABLE
OH NO SAID I I PREFER TO RUN BY MYSELF FOR I CAN EASILY FIND THE WAY AND I WANT TO SEE THE COUNTRY IF THAT IS THE CASE REPLIED SANTA I MUST GIVE YOU A MAGIC COLLAR TO WEAR SO THAT YOU WILL COME TO NO HARM
ITS AVENUE OF AGED FIRS ALL GROWN ASLANT UNDER THE STRESS OF MOUNTAIN WINDS ITS GARDEN DARK WITH YEW AND HOLLY AND WHERE NO FLOWERS BUT OF THE HARDIEST SPECIES WOULD BLOOM FOUND A CHARM BOTH POTENT AND PERMANENT
WHAT I HAD PERUSED DURING THE DAY THOUGHT FITTED THOUGHT OPINION MET OPINION WE COINCIDED IN SHORT PERFECTLY IF IN OUR TRIO THERE WAS A SUPERIOR AND A LEADER IT WAS DIANA PHYSICALLY SHE FAR EXCELLED ME
DIANA OFFERED TO TEACH ME GERMAN I LIKED TO LEARN OF HER I SAW THE PART OF INSTRUCTRESS PLEASED AND SUITED HER THAT OF SCHOLAR PLEASED AND SUITED ME NO LESS
FEARING AT FIRST THE NEW RABBIT WAS ALIVE OLD SANTA LAUGHED MERRILY AT THIS AND I SOON RECOVERED FROM MY FRIGHT AND WAS PLEASED TO THINK THE BABIES WERE TO HAVE SUCH PRETTY PLAYTHINGS
THE PIG IS EAT YOUR HONOR HE ANSWERED THE FARMER SAID NEVER A WORD BUT HIS FACE GREW BLACK WITH ANGER AND UNBUCKLING THE STRAP THAT WAS ABOUT HIS WAIST HE WAVED IT AROUND HIS HEAD AND WHACK
THE PIPER AND HIS SON HAD A FINE DINNER THAT DAY AND SO GREAT WAS THEIR HUNGER THAT THE LITTLE PIG WAS ALL EATEN UP AT ONE MEAL THEN BARNEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP AND TOM SAT ON A BENCH OUTSIDE THE DOOR
AND THEY WILL GO IN THREE DAYS NOW I SAID YES AND WHEN THEY GO I SHALL RETURN TO THE PARSONAGE AT MORTON HANNAH WILL ACCOMPANY ME AND THIS OLD HOUSE WILL BE SHUT UP
AND AID THEM WHEN AND WHERE THEY WOULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A REVIVING PLEASURE IN THIS INTERCOURSE OF A KIND NOW TASTED BY ME FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND THERE HE SAW TOM SITTING ON A BENCH AND BLOWING ON A WHISTLE MADE FROM A PIG'S TAIL WHERE DID YOU GET THAT TAIL ASKED THE FARMER I FOUND IT SAID NAUGHTY TOM BEGINNING TO BE FRIGHTENED LET ME SEE IT DEMANDED THE FARMER
OF COURSE I CONSENTED FOR WE ALL LIKE TO PLEASE OLD SANTA AND A MINUTE LATER I HAD JUMPED INTO THE SLEIGH BESIDE HIM AND WE WERE DASHING AWAY AT FULL SPEED TOWARD HIS CASTLE I ENJOYED THE RIDE VERY MUCH BUT I ENJOYED THE CASTLE FAR MORE
BUT THEN YOU SEE I HAVE BEEN MAKING TOYS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND I MAKE SO MANY IT IS NO WONDER I AM SKILLFUL AND NOW IF YOU ARE READY TO GO HOME I LL HITCH UP THE REINDEER AND TAKE YOU BACK AGAIN
BUT HE WAS SO SLY AND CAUTIOUS THAT NO ONE HAD EVER CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT OF STEALING ALTHOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS HAD BEEN MISSED AFTER THEY HAD FALLEN INTO THE OLD MAN'S WAY BARNEY HAD ONE SON NAMED TOM
HE EXPRESSED ONCE AND BUT ONCE IN MY HEARING A STRONG SENSE OF THE RUGGED CHARM OF THE HILLS AND AN INBORN AFFECTION FOR THE DARK ROOF AND HOARY WALLS HE CALLED HIS HOME
AND IF I LET A GUST OF WIND OR A SPRINKLING OF RAIN TURN ME ASIDE FROM THESE EASY TASKS WHAT PREPARATION WOULD SUCH SLOTH BE FOR THE FUTURE I PROPOSE TO MYSELF DIANA AND MARY'S GENERAL ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WAS A SIGH
DEVELOPED FOR ME IN THESE REGIONS THE SAME ATTRACTION AS FOR THEM WOUND ROUND MY FACULTIES THE SAME SPELL THAT ENTRANCED THEIRS INDOORS WE AGREED EQUALLY WELL
I DO N'T DOUBT IT YOUR HONOR I ANSWERED BUT THEY D SOON KILL ME WITH HANDLING EVEN IF THEY DID NOT SCARE ME TO DEATH FOR BABIES ARE VERY ROUGH WITH THEIR PLAYTHINGS THAT IS TRUE REPLIED SANTA CLAUS AND YET YOU ARE SO SOFT AND PRETTY
THEY WERE BOTH MORE ACCOMPLISHED AND BETTER READ THAN I WAS BUT WITH EAGERNESS I FOLLOWED IN THE PATH OF KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD TRODDEN BEFORE ME I DEVOURED THE BOOKS THEY LENT ME THEN IT WAS FULL SATISFACTION TO DISCUSS WITH THEM IN THE EVENING
DID NOT EXTEND TO HIM ONE REASON OF THE DISTANCE YET OBSERVED BETWEEN US WAS THAT HE WAS COMPARATIVELY SELDOM AT HOME A LARGE PROPORTION OF HIS TIME APPEARED DEVOTED TO VISITING THE SICK AND POOR AMONG THE SCATTERED POPULATION OF HIS PARISH
HE NEVER DID ANY WORK EXCEPT TO PLAY THE PIPES AND HE PLAYED SO BADLY THAT FEW PENNIES EVER FOUND THEIR WAY INTO HIS POUCH IT WAS WHISPERED AROUND THAT OLD BARNEY WAS NOT VERY HONEST
AND HER CUPBOARD IS NEVER BARE NOW I CAN PROMISE YOU AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE THERE IS ONE BIG ROOM AND THAT IS SANTA'S WORK SHOP WHERE HE MAKES THE TOYS ON ONE SIDE IS HIS WORK BENCH WITH PLENTY OF SAWS AND HAMMERS AND JACK KNIVES
SANTA NEVER FORGETS ME AND EVERY TIME HE PASSES HE CALLS OUT IN HIS JOLLY VOICE A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU BUN RABBIT THE BABIES STILL LOVE YOU DEARLY THE RABBIT PAUSED AND DOROTHY WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION
THEY CLUNG TO THE PURPLE MOORS BEHIND AND AROUND THEIR DWELLING TO THE HOLLOW VALE INTO WHICH THE PEBBLY BRIDLE PATH LEADING FROM THEIR GATE DESCENDED AND WHICH WOUND BETWEEN FERN BANKS FIRST AND THEN AMONGST A FEW OF THE WILDEST LITTLE PASTURE FIELDS
AND I SEE THE DOGS AND THE MEN LONG BEFORE THEY CAN SEE ME OR KNOW THAT I AM NEAR AND THEREFORE I AM ABLE TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY IS THAT THE REASON YOUR EYES ARE SO BIG ASKED DOROTHY I SUPPOSE SO RETURNED THE RABBIT
AFTER I GOT HOME REPLIED THE RABBIT THE COLLAR DISAPPEARED FROM AROUND MY NECK AND I KNEW SANTA HAD CALLED IT BACK TO HIMSELF AGAIN HE DID NOT GIVE IT TO ME YOU SEE HE MERELY LET ME TAKE IT ON MY JOURNEY TO PROTECT ME
AND IN A MINUTE TOM HAD THE PIG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM AND WAS RUNNING BACK HOME WITH IT THE PIPER WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE THE PIG AND SAID TO TOM YOU ARE A GOOD SON AND THE PIG IS VERY NICE AND FAT WE SHALL HAVE A DINNER FIT FOR A KING
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE STY THERE WAS NO PIG TO BE SEEN AND HE SEARCHED ALL ROUND THE PLACE FOR A GOOD HOUR WITHOUT FINDING IT
WHEN TOM SHOWED BY HIS ACTIONS HIS INTENTION OF BEING HONEST HE SOON GOT A JOB OF WORK TO DO AND BEFORE LONG HE WAS ABLE TO EARN A LIVING MORE EASILY AND A GREAT DEAL MORE HONESTLY
AND SO HE SNIPPED A LITTLE OFF THE FUR HE WAS CUTTING
BUT THE FIRST GUSH OF VIVACITY AND FLUENCY GONE I WAS FAIN TO SIT ON A STOOL AT DIANA'S FEET TO REST MY HEAD ON HER KNEE AND LISTEN ALTERNATELY TO HER AND MARY WHILE THEY SOUNDED THOROUGHLY THE TOPIC ON WHICH I HAD BUT TOUCHED
SO HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND BUCKLED A STRAP AROUND HIS WAIST AND WENT DOWN TO THE VILLAGE TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND OUT WHO HAD STOLEN HIS PIG UP AND DOWN THE STREET HE WENT AND IN AND OUT THE LANES
AND HE TALKED TO ME IN SUCH A JOLLY WAY THAT I SAT PERFECTLY STILL AND ALLOWED HIM TO MEASURE MY EARS AND MY LEGS SO THAT HE COULD CUT THE FUR INTO THE PROPER FORM
AH YOU CAN RUN ABOUT ALL DAY IN SUMMER AND IN WINTER AND ENJOY YOURSELF IN YOUR OWN WAY SAID SANTA BUT THE POOR LITTLE CHILDREN ARE OBLIGED TO STAY IN THE HOUSE IN THE WINTER AND ON RAINY DAYS IN THE SUMMER
UNDER HIS FATHER'S GUIDANCE HE FELL INTO BAD WAYS ONE MORNING TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON WAS HUNGRY WHEN THE DAY BEGUN HE WANTED A BUN AND ASKED FOR ONE BUT SOON FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE NONE
THE ROOMS ARE BIG AND HIGH AND THERE IS A SOFT CARPET UPON EVERY FLOOR AND MANY STRANGE THINGS SCATTERED AROUND TO AMUSE ONE SANTA CLAUS LIVES THERE ALL ALONE EXCEPT FOR OLD MOTHER HUBBARD WHO COOKS THE MEALS FOR HIM
AND HE PLAYED THIS ONE TUNE AS BADLY AS HIS FATHER HIMSELF PLAYED SO THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ANNOYED WHEN THEY HEARD HIM AND OFTEN BEGGED HIM TO STOP WHEN HE CAME TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE TOM STARTED UP THE PIPES
SO TOM TOOK HIS FATHER'S PIPES AND WALKED OVER THE HILL TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON LEARNED TO PLAY WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
THE PIG WAS EAT AND TOM WAS BEAT AND TOM RAN CRYING DOWN THE STREET
STILL AS THEY WOULD ABUSE A LIVE RABBIT I THINK I SHALL MAKE THEM SOME TOY RABBITS WHICH THEY CANNOT HURT SO IF YOU WILL JUMP INTO MY SLEIGH WITH ME AND RIDE HOME TO MY CASTLE FOR A FEW DAYS I LL SEE IF I CAN'T MAKE SOME TOY RABBITS JUST LIKE YOU
AND SANTA CLAUS WHEN HE SEES ME ALWAYS GIVES ME A NOD AND A SMILE AND THEN I LOOK AFTER HIM AND HIS BIG LOAD OF TOYS WHICH HE IS CARRYING TO THE CHILDREN UNTIL HE HAS GALLOPED AWAY OUT OF SIGHT I LIKE TO SEE THE TOYS FOR THEY ARE SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY
ONE OF CLOSE AND ANXIOUS INTEREST TO ME WHAT IS THE EMPLOYMENT YOU HAD IN VIEW MISTER RIVERS I HOPE THIS DELAY WILL NOT HAVE INCREASED THE DIFFICULTY OF SECURING IT
UNTIL THE RABBIT BECAME REASSURED AND BLINKED HIS BIG EYES AT HER THOUGHTFULLY FOR HE WAS AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE LITTLE GIRL AS SHE IN HIM SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DARED TO MEET A PERSON FACE TO FACE
AND AT FIRST I DID N'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS THE LIVE RABBIT OR THE TOY RABBIT WE WERE SO MUCH ALIKE
I WAITED A FEW MOMENTS EXPECTING HE WOULD GO ON WITH THE SUBJECT FIRST BROACHED BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE ENTERED ANOTHER TRAIN OF REFLECTION HIS LOOK DENOTED ABSTRACTION FROM ME AND MY BUSINESS
AND APPRECIATED ONLY THEIR ACQUIRED ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS THEY APPRECIATED THE SKILL OF THEIR COOK OR THE TASTE OF THEIR WAITING WOMAN
WHO WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THE GIRL SPEAK IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE IN SUMMER TIME I SEE THE CLOVER LEAVES THAT I LOVE TO FEED UPON AND THE CABBAGES AT THE END OF THE FARMER'S GARDEN I SEE THE COOL BUSHES WHERE I CAN HIDE FROM MY ENEMIES
AND BEING THE ONLY CHILD UPON THE FARM SHE WAS ALLOWED TO ROAM ABOUT THE MEADOWS AND WOODS AS SHE PLEASED ON THE BRIGHT SUMMER MORNINGS DOROTHY'S MOTHER WOULD TIE A SUN BONNET UNDER THE GIRL'S CHIN
I SCARCELY KNOW IN WHICH LIGHT HE REGARDED IT SOMETIMES WHEN THE DAY WAS VERY UNFAVOURABLE HIS SISTERS WOULD EXPOSTULATE HE WOULD THEN SAY WITH A PECULIAR SMILE MORE SOLEMN THAN CHEERFUL
YOU HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK OF ME HE SAID YES I WISH TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE HEARD OF ANY SERVICE I CAN OFFER MYSELF TO UNDERTAKE I FOUND OR DEVISED SOMETHING FOR YOU THREE WEEKS AGO BUT AS YOU SEEMED BOTH USEFUL AND HAPPY HERE
NO WEATHER SEEMED TO HINDER HIM IN THESE PASTORAL EXCURSIONS RAIN OR FAIR HE WOULD WHEN HIS HOURS OF MORNING STUDY WERE OVER TAKE HIS HAT AND FOLLOWED BY HIS FATHER'S OLD POINTER CARLO GO OUT ON HIS MISSION OF LOVE OR DUTY
AFTER MOTHER HUBBARD HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD DINNER AND I HAD EATEN SOME OF THE MOST DELICIOUS CLOVER I HAVE EVER TASTED SANTA TOOK ME UP INTO HIS WORK ROOM AND SAT ME UPON THE TABLE IF I CAN ONLY MAKE RABBITS HALF AS NICE AS YOU ARE HE SAID
AND AGAIN HE SAID GOOD GRACIOUS THE EARS ARE TOO SHORT ENTIRELY SO HE HAD TO GET A NEEDLE AND THREAD AND SEW ON MORE FUR TO THE EARS SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE THE RIGHT SIZE BUT AFTER A TIME IT WAS ALL FINISHED
AND EVERY YEAR THERE IS SOMETHING NEW AMONGST THEM ONCE I VISITED SANTA AND SAW HIM MAKE THE TOYS
AS MY SISTERS HAD EVIDENTLY BECOME ATTACHED TO YOU AND YOUR SOCIETY GAVE THEM UNUSUAL PLEASURE I DEEMED IT INEXPEDIENT TO BREAK IN ON YOUR MUTUAL COMFORT TILL THEIR APPROACHING DEPARTURE FROM MARSH END SHOULD RENDER YOURS NECESSARY
AND SOME MINUTES OF APPARENTLY MOURNFUL MEDITATION BUT BESIDES HIS FREQUENT ABSENCES THERE WAS ANOTHER BARRIER TO FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM HE SEEMED OF A RESERVED AN ABSTRACTED AND EVEN OF A BROODING NATURE
THAT EVER BORDERED A WILDERNESS OF HEATH OR GAVE SUSTENANCE TO A FLOCK OF GREY MOORLAND SHEEP WITH THEIR LITTLE MOSSY FACED LAMBS THEY CLUNG TO THIS SCENE I SAY WITH A PERFECT ENTHUSIASM OF ATTACHMENT
BUT THAT IT WAS PERTURBED AND EXCITING MIGHT BE SEEN IN THE FREQUENT FLASH AND CHANGEFUL DILATION OF HIS EYE I THINK MOREOVER THAT NATURE WAS NOT TO HIM
OFTEN OF AN EVENING WHEN HE SAT AT THE WINDOW HIS DESK AND PAPERS BEFORE HIM HE WOULD CEASE READING OR WRITING REST HIS CHIN ON HIS HAND AND DELIVER HIMSELF UP TO I KNOW NOT WHAT COURSE OF THOUGHT
A GOOD BEATING AND TOM WAS SO SCARED THAT HE NEVER STOPPED RUNNING UNTIL HE CAME TO THE END OF THE VILLAGE AND HE BAWLED LUSTILY THE WHOLE WAY AND CRIED OUT AT EVERY STEP
FOR THE WORD PASSED AROUND AMONGST THEM THAT SHE COULD BE TRUSTED TO DO THEM NO HARM FOR THE HORSE WHOSE SOFT NOSE DOROTHY OFTEN GENTLY STROKED TOLD THE COW OF HER KINDNESS AND THE COW TOLD THE DOG AND THE DOG TOLD THE CAT
AND I SAW A GOOD MANY STRANGE SIGHTS BEFORE I GOT BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN BUT WHAT BECAME OF THE MAGIC COLLAR ASKED DOROTHY WHO HAD LISTENED WITH BREATHLESS INTEREST TO THE RABBIT'S STORY
AND BEGAN TO PLAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE FARMER WAS IN HIS WOODSHED SAWING WOOD SO HE DID NOT HEAR THE PIPES AND THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS DEAF AND COULD NOT HEAR THEM
ON THE WILD COLOURING COMMUNICATED TO RIDGE AND DELL BY MOSS BY HEATH BELL BY FLOWER SPRINKLED TURF BY BRILLIANT BRACKEN AND MELLOW GRANITE CRAG THESE DETAILS WERE JUST TO ME WHAT THEY WERE TO THEM
REGRETS TO WHICH I HAVE LATTERLY AVOIDED REFERRING BUT WHICH POSSESSED ME AND TYRANNISED OVER ME RUTHLESSLY MEANTIME A MONTH WAS GONE
IT WAS DARK BEFORE HE CAME BACK TO HIS HOME AND HIS FATHER WAS STILL ASLEEP SO TOM CREPT INTO THE HUT AND WENT TO BED BUT HE HAD RECEIVED A GOOD LESSON AND NEVER AFTER THAT COULD THE OLD PIPER INDUCE HIM TO STEAL
BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE WINTER IN WINTER WE RABBITS SAID BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY AND DO YOU EVER SEE HIM ASKED THE GIRL EAGERLY OH YES EVERY WINTER
IF I WENT TO HIS HOUSE HE DID LAST WEEK YOU KNOW
I LIVE IN THE GROUND FAR DOWN IN A COOL PLEASANT HOLE I HAVE DUG IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE IS THE NICEST LITTLE ROOM YOU CAN IMAGINE AND THERE I HAVE MADE A SOFT BED TO REST IN AT NIGHT
WHEN I HEARD HIM PREACH IN HIS OWN CHURCH AT MORTON I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE THAT SERMON BUT IT IS PAST MY POWER I CANNOT EVEN RENDER FAITHFULLY THE EFFECT IT PRODUCED ON ME
THE FARMER HAD STOPPED SAWING TO REST JUST THEN AND WHEN HE HEARD THE SINGING HE RUSHED OUT OF THE SHED AND CHASED TOM AWAY WITH A BIG STICK OF WOOD THE BOY WENT BACK TO HIS FATHER AND SAID SORROWFULLY FOR HE WAS MORE HUNGRY THAN BEFORE
AND THEY LIVED ALL ALONE IN A LITTLE HUT AWAY AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE STREET FOR TOM'S MOTHER HAD DIED WHEN HE WAS A BABY YOU MAY NOT SUPPOSE THAT TOM WAS A VERY GOOD BOY SINCE HE HAD SUCH A QUEER FATHER BUT NEITHER WAS HE VERY BAD
AFTER THIS SAID SANTA CLAUS I CAN MAKE RABBITS WITHOUT HAVING YOU FOR A PATTERN BUT IF YOU LIKE YOU MAY STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER IN MY CASTLE AND AMUSE YOURSELF I THANKED HIM AND DECIDED TO STAY
OH NO SINCE IT IS AN EMPLOYMENT WHICH DEPENDS ONLY ON ME TO GIVE AND YOU TO ACCEPT
FINALLY DOROTHY VENTURED TO SPEAK SO SHE ASKED VERY SOFTLY AND SLOWLY OH LITTLE BUN RABBIT SO SOFT AND SO SHY SAY WHAT DO YOU SEE WITH YOUR BIG ROUND EYE MANY THINGS ANSWERED THE RABBIT
INCOMMUNICATIVE AS HE WAS SOME TIME ELAPSED BEFORE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF GAUGING HIS MIND
AND DID NOT LIKE TO CRUSH THE PRETTY FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN HER PATH AND SHE WAS ALSO VERY FOND OF ALL THE ANIMALS AND LEARNED TO KNOW THEM WELL AND EVEN TO UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN DO AND THE ANIMALS LOVED DOROTHY IN TURN
WHEN HE SAVED ME THE TROUBLE BY BEING THE FIRST TO COMMENCE A DIALOGUE
THE FARMER GAVE ME NOTHING BUT A SCOLDING BUT THERE WAS A VERY NICE PIG RUNNING AROUND THE YARD HOW BIG WAS IT ASKED BARNEY OH JUST ABOUT BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE A NICE DINNER FOR YOU AND ME
THE LITTLE ONES WILL BE DELIGHTED THEN HE LIT A BIG PIPE AND BEGAN TO SMOKE AND SOON HE TOOK A ROLL OF SOFT FUR FROM A SHELF IN A CORNER AND COMMENCED TO CUT IT OUT IN THE SHAPE OF A RABBIT HE SMOKED AND WHISTLED ALL THE TIME HE WAS WORKING
MARY WOULD SIT AND WATCH ME BY THE HOUR TOGETHER THEN SHE WOULD TAKE LESSONS AND A DOCILE INTELLIGENT ASSIDUOUS PUPIL SHE MADE THUS OCCUPIED AND MUTUALLY ENTERTAINED DAYS PASSED LIKE HOURS AND WEEKS LIKE DAYS
AND THEN THEY MUST HAVE TOYS TO AMUSE THEM AND KEEP THEM CONTENTED I KNEW THIS WAS TRUE SO I ONLY SAID ADMIRINGLY YOU MUST BE THE QUICKEST AND THE BEST WORKMAN IN ALL THE WORLD SANTA I SUPPOSE I AM HE ANSWERED
AND WENT ABOUT HIS USUAL OCCUPATIONS WITH MORE HOPE AND PLEASURE THAN HE HAD KNOWN FOR MANY DAYS THE BIRDS WERE ONCE MORE HUNG OUT TO SING IN THEIR OLD PLACES AND THE SWEETEST WILD FLOWERS THAT COULD BE FOUND WERE ONCE MORE GATHERED TO GLADDEN ROSE WITH THEIR BEAUTY
AND LAID IT DOWN AGAIN FIFTY TIMES AND HAD CONSIDERED AND RECONSIDERED THE FIRST LINE OF HER LETTER WITHOUT WRITING THE FIRST WORD WHEN OLIVER WHO HAD BEEN WALKING IN THE STREETS WITH MISTER GILES FOR A BODY GUARD ENTERED THE ROOM IN SUCH BREATHLESS HASTE AND VIOLENT AGITATION
IN THE FIRST EXPLOSION OF HIS INDIGNATION HE WOULD REGARD THE INSTRUMENT OF OLIVER'S RECAPTURE TO TRUST HIM WITH THE SECRET WHEN HER REPRESENTATIONS IN THE GIRL'S BEHALF COULD BE SECONDED BY NO EXPERIENCED PERSON
RESERVING NANCY'S INFORMATION FOR THAT GENTLEMAN'S PRIVATE EAR AND CONCLUDING WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HIS ONLY SORROW FOR SOME MONTHS PAST HAD BEEN NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET WITH HIS FORMER BENEFACTOR AND FRIEND THANK GOD SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN
AND WHY SHOULD I SUFFER THE PAIN OF A DELAY IN GIVING THEM VENT WHICH CAN BE PRODUCTIVE OF NO EARTHLY GOOD NO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE ROSE SHALL HEAR ME SHE SHALL SAID MISSUS MAYLIE
HE IS COGNIZANT OF THE BUSINESS ON WHICH I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU MISTER BROWNLOW INCLINED HIS HEAD MISTER GRIMWIG WHO HAD MADE ONE VERY STIFF BOW AND RISEN FROM HIS CHAIR MADE ANOTHER VERY STIFF BOW AND DROPPED INTO IT AGAIN
BE SEATED PRAY MISTER BROWNLOW I BELIEVE SIR SAID ROSE GLANCING FROM THE OTHER GENTLEMAN TO THE ONE WHO HAD SPOKEN THAT IS MY NAME SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THIS IS MY FRIEND MISTER GRIMWIG
AND AS THE DAY HAD BEEN UNCOMMONLY SULTRY AND HE HAD EXERTED HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL IT IS NO DISPARAGEMENT TO THE AUTHORS WHOEVER THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TO SAY THAT GRADUALLY AND BY SLOW DEGREES HE FELL ASLEEP
I HAVE NO THOUGHT NO VIEW NO HOPE IN LIFE BEYOND HER AND IF YOU OPPOSE ME IN THIS GREAT STAKE YOU TAKE MY PEACE AND HAPPINESS IN YOUR HANDS AND CAST THEM TO THE WIND MOTHER THINK BETTER OF THIS AND OF ME
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW WHAT INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVE OF THIS POOR CHILD ALLOWING ME TO PROMISE THAT I EXHAUSTED EVERY MEANS IN MY POWER OF DISCOVERING HIM AND THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN ABSENT FROM THIS COUNTRY MY FIRST IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD IMPOSED UPON ME
AND DOUBTLESS HE WOULD IN THIS FIRST OUTBREAK HAVE CARRIED THE INTENTION INTO EFFECT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF HE HAD NOT BEEN RESTRAINED IN PART BY CORRESPONDING VIOLENCE ON THE SIDE OF MISTER BROWNLOW
WHEN THE ROOM DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM MISTER GRIMWIG LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND CONVERTING ONE OF THE HIND LEGS OF HIS CHAIR INTO A PIVOT DESCRIBED THREE DISTINCT CIRCLES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS STICK AND THE TABLE SITTING IN IT ALL THE TIME AFTER PERFORMING THIS EVOLUTION
THE GOOD SOUL LAUGHED AND WEPT UPON HIS NECK BY TURNS LEAVING HER AND OLIVER TO COMPARE NOTES AT LEISURE MISTER BROWNLOW LED THE WAY INTO ANOTHER ROOM AND THERE HEARD FROM ROSE A FULL NARRATION OF HER INTERVIEW WITH NANCY
THIS IS GREAT HAPPINESS TO ME GREAT HAPPINESS BUT YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHERE HE IS NOW MISS MAYLIE YOU MUST PARDON MY FINDING FAULT WITH YOU
THE MELANCHOLY WHICH HAD SEEMED TO THE SAD EYES OF THE ANXIOUS BOY TO HANG FOR DAYS PAST OVER EVERY OBJECT BEAUTIFUL AS ALL WERE WAS DISPELLED BY MAGIC THE DEW SEEMED TO SPARKLE MORE BRIGHTLY ON THE GREEN LEAVES THE AIR TO RUSTLE AMONG THEM WITH A SWEETER MUSIC
AND MISTER LOSBERNE SAYS THAT ALL DANGER IS AT AN END THE GENTLEMAN SAID NOT ANOTHER WORD BUT OPENING THE CHAISE DOOR LEAPED OUT AND TAKING OLIVER HURRIEDLY BY THE ARM LED HIM ASIDE YOU ARE QUITE CERTAIN
WHO MAY HE BE THAT LADY'S SON AND THIS YOUNG LADY'S VERY OLD FRIEND SAID THE DOCTOR MOTIONING TOWARDS MISSUS MAYLIE AND CONCLUDING WITH AN EXPRESSIVE GLANCE AT HER NIECE
OLIVER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE WAS IN HIS OWN LITTLE ROOM THAT HIS BOOKS WERE LYING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM THAT THE SWEET AIR WAS STIRRING AMONG THE CREEPING PLANTS OUTSIDE AND YET HE WAS ASLEEP SUDDENLY THE SCENE CHANGED
HE SEEMED ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS OF AGE AND WAS OF THE MIDDLE HEIGHT HIS COUNTENANCE WAS FRANK AND HANDSOME AND HIS DEMEANOR EASY AND PREPOSSESSING NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUTH AND AGE
SAID THE DOCTOR NONE AT ALL SIR REPLIED MISTER GILES WITH MUCH GRAVITY WELL SAID THE DOCTOR I AM SORRY TO HEAR IT BECAUSE YOU DO THAT SORT OF THING ADMIRABLY PRAY HOW IS BRITTLES
QUICK SHE SAID TELL THEM TO FETCH A HACKNEY COACH AND BE READY TO GO WITH ME I WILL TAKE YOU THERE DIRECTLY WITHOUT A MINUTE'S LOSS OF TIME I WILL ONLY TELL MY AUNT THAT WE ARE GOING OUT FOR AN HOUR AND BE READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE
DEAR ME SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE BOTTLE GREEN COAT HASTILY RISING WITH GREAT POLITENESS I BEG YOUR PARDON YOUNG LADY I IMAGINED IT WAS SOME IMPORTUNATE PERSON WHO I BEG YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
GRIMWIG WILL YOU LEAVE US FOR A FEW MINUTES I BELIEVE INTERPOSED MISS MAYLIE THAT AT THIS PERIOD OF OUR INTERVIEW I NEED NOT GIVE THAT GENTLEMAN THE TROUBLE OF GOING AWAY IF I AM CORRECTLY INFORMED
WITH HER ATTENTION NOT A LITTLE DISTRACTED BY THESE AND A GREAT MANY OTHER INCOHERENT EXCLAMATIONS OF JOY ROSE READ THE ADDRESS WHICH WAS CRAVEN STREET IN THE STRAND SHE VERY SOON DETERMINED UPON TURNING THE DISCOVERY TO ACCOUNT
DON'T BE AFRAID I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR GRANDFATHER YOU'RE A SWEET GIRL I LIKE YOU HERE THEY ARE IN FACT AS HE THREW HIMSELF AT ONE DEXTEROUS DIVE INTO HIS FORMER SEAT MISTER BROWNLOW RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY OLIVER
URGED THE YOUNG MAN SHE HAS FORMED NO OTHER ATTACHMENT NO INDEED REPLIED HIS MOTHER YOU HAVE OR I MISTAKE TOO STRONG A HOLD ON HER AFFECTIONS ALREADY WHAT I WOULD SAY RESUMED THE OLD LADY STOPPING HER SON AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK
AND READILY UNDERTOOK TO HOLD SOLEMN CONFERENCE WITH THE WORTHY DOCTOR HIMSELF TO AFFORD HIM AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THIS DESIGN IT WAS ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD CALL AT THE HOTEL AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT EVENING AND THAT IN THE MEANTIME
THE FORMER NOW HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HARRY MAYLIE AND HEARTY SALUTATIONS WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN THEM THE DOCTOR THEN COMMUNICATED IN REPLY TO MULTIFARIOUS QUESTIONS FROM HIS YOUNG FRIEND A PRECISE ACCOUNT OF HIS PATIENT'S SITUATION
OR HOW COULD SHE POSTPONE THE JOURNEY WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION MISTER LOSBERNE WAS WITH THEM AND WOULD BE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS BUT ROSE WAS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXCELLENT GENTLEMAN'S IMPETUOSITY AND FORESAW TOO CLEARLY THE WRATH WITH WHICH
THAT CREPT OVER THE CASEMENT AND FILLED THE PLACE WITH THEIR DELICIOUS PERFUME IT LOOKED INTO A GARDEN WHENCE A WICKET GATE OPENED INTO A SMALL PADDOCK ALL BEYOND WAS FINE MEADOW LAND AND WOOD THERE WAS NO OTHER DWELLING NEAR IN THAT DIRECTION
HE WAS FAIN TO ADMIT THAT NO BETTER COURSE OCCURRED TO HIM JUST THEN AND AS BOTH ROSE AND MISSUS MAYLIE SIDED VERY STRONGLY WITH MISTER BROWNLOW THAT GENTLEMAN'S PROPOSITION WAS CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY I SHOULD LIKE HE SAID
OLIVER NEEDED NO PROMPTING TO DESPATCH AND IN LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CRAVEN STREET WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE ROSE LEFT OLIVER IN THE COACH UNDER PRETENCE OF PREPARING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO RECEIVE HIM
AND SENDING UP HER CARD BY THE SERVANT REQUESTED TO SEE MISTER BROWNLOW ON VERY PRESSING BUSINESS THE SERVANT SOON RETURNED TO BEG THAT SHE WOULD WALK UPSTAIRS AND FOLLOWING HIM INTO AN UPPER ROOM MISS MAYLIE WAS PRESENTED TO AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN OF BENEVOLENT APPEARANCE
HE ROSE AND LIMPED AS FAST AS HE COULD UP AND DOWN THE ROOM AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND THEN STOPPING SUDDENLY BEFORE ROSE KISSED HER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST PREFACE HUSH HE SAID AS THE YOUNG LADY ROSE IN SOME ALARM AT THIS UNUSUAL PROCEEDING
HE IS WAITING IN A COACH AT THE DOOR REPLIED ROSE AT THIS DOOR CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH WHICH HE HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM DOWN THE STAIRS UP THE COACHSTEPS AND INTO THE COACH WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
LADEN WITH FLOWERS WHICH HE HAD CULLED WITH PECULIAR CARE FOR THE ADORNMENT OF THE SICK CHAMBER AS HE WALKED BRISKLY ALONG THE ROAD HE HEARD BEHIND HIM THE NOISE OF SOME VEHICLE APPROACHING AT A FURIOUS PACE
TO CALL IN THE AID OF MY FRIEND GRIMWIG HE IS A STRANGE CREATURE BUT A SHREWD ONE AND MIGHT PROVE OF MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO US I SHOULD SAY THAT HE WAS BRED A LAWYER AND QUITTED THE BAR IN DISGUST BECAUSE HE HAD ONLY ONE BRIEF AND A MOTION OF COURSE
THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY STRATAGEM AND BY CATCHING HIM WHEN HE IS NOT SURROUNDED BY THESE PEOPLE FOR SUPPOSE HE WERE APPREHENDED WE HAVE NO PROOF AGAINST HIM HE IS NOT EVEN SO FAR AS WE KNOW OR AS THE FACTS APPEAR TO US
AND IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO PRODUCE ANY EVIDENCE WHICH WILL ALTER THE UNFAVOURABLE OPINION I WAS ONCE INDUCED TO ENTERTAIN OF THAT POOR CHILD IN HEAVEN'S NAME PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF IT A BAD ONE I'LL EAT MY HEAD IF HE IS NOT A BAD ONE
UPSET IT WITH A GREAT CRASH AND FALLING BACK IN HIS CHAIR DISCHARGED FROM HIS FEATURES EVERY EXPRESSION BUT ONE OF UNMITIGATED WONDER AND INDULGED IN A PROLONGED AND VACANT STARE THEN AS IF ASHAMED OF HAVING BETRAYED SO MUCH EMOTION
HER WORDS AND MANNER HAD TOUCHED ROSE MAYLIE'S HEART AND MINGLED WITH HER LOVE FOR HER YOUNG CHARGE AND SCARCELY LESS INTENSE IN ITS TRUTH AND FERVOUR WAS HER FOND WISH TO WIN THE OUTCAST BACK TO REPENTANCE AND HOPE
I'D SEND THEM ONE AND ALL TO NEVER MIND WHERE INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNLOW BUT REFLECT WHETHER SENDING THEM ANYWHERE IS LIKELY TO ATTAIN THE OBJECT WE HAVE IN VIEW WHAT OBJECT ASKED THE DOCTOR
RUNNING UP TO THE CHAISE DOOR GILES POPPED OUT HIS NIGHTCAP AGAIN PREPARATORY TO MAKING SOME REPLY WHEN HE WAS SUDDENLY PULLED BACK BY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO OCCUPIED THE OTHER CORNER OF THE CHAISE AND WHO EAGERLY DEMANDED WHAT WAS THE NEWS
WHICH WAS QUITE AS CONSOLATORY AND FULL OF PROMISE AS OLIVER'S STATEMENT HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE AND TO THE WHOLE OF WHICH MISTER GILES WHO AFFECTED TO BE BUSY ABOUT THE LUGGAGE LISTENED WITH GREEDY EARS
THIS DONE THE POSTBOY DROVE OFF GILES MISTER MAYLIE AND OLIVER FOLLOWED AT THEIR LEISURE AS THEY WALKED ALONG OLIVER GLANCED FROM TIME TO TIME WITH MUCH INTEREST AND CURIOSITY AT THE NEW COMER
GETTING OUT OF A COACH REPLIED OLIVER SHEDDING TEARS OF DELIGHT AND GOING INTO A HOUSE I DIDN'T SPEAK TO HIM I COULDN'T SPEAK TO HIM FOR HE DIDN'T SEE ME AND I TREMBLED SO THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO GO UP TO HIM BUT GILES ASKED FOR ME
HE BORE SO STRONG A LIKENESS TO THE OLD LADY THAT OLIVER WOULD HAVE HAD NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN IMAGINING THEIR RELATIONSHIP IF HE HAD NOT ALREADY SPOKEN OF HER AS HIS MOTHER MISSUS MAYLIE WAS ANXIOUSLY WAITING TO RECEIVE HER SON WHEN HE REACHED THE COTTAGE
NOT TO BE DISCHARGED ON EMPTY AIR BUT TO DIE AWAY IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF HIS STOMACH MISTER BROWLOW WAS NO LESS SURPRISED ALTHOUGH HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT EXPRESSED IN THE SAME ECCENTRIC MANNER HE DREW HIS CHAIR NEARER TO MISS MAYLIE'S AND SAID
IT WAS WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN THIS PURSUIT THAT HE WAS GREATLY STARTLED AND DISTRESSED BY A MOST UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE THE LITTLE ROOM IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SIT WHEN BUSY AT HIS BOOKS
IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE HARRY SAID MISSUS MAYLIE
WILL BE INFLUENCED AND MATERIALLY INFLUENCED BY THE MERE SILENT PRESENCE OF SOME EXTERNAL OBJECT WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN NEAR US WHEN WE CLOSED OUR EYES AND OF WHOSE VICINITY WE HAVE HAD NO WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS
CONCERNED WITH THE GANG IN ANY OF THEIR ROBBERIES IF HE WERE NOT DISCHARGED IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT HE COULD RECEIVE ANY FURTHER PUNISHMENT THAN BEING COMMITTED TO PRISON AS A ROGUE AND VAGABOND
A BURST OF TEARS CAME TO HIS RELIEF AND HE SEEMED TO AWAKEN ALL AT ONCE TO A FULL SENSE OF THE JOYFUL CHANGE THAT HAD OCCURRED AND THE ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE LOAD OF ANGUISH WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIS BREAST THE NIGHT WAS FAST CLOSING IN WHEN HE RETURNED HOMEWARD
THEY PURPOSED REMAINING IN LONDON ONLY THREE DAYS PRIOR TO DEPARTING FOR SOME WEEKS TO A DISTANT PART OF THE COAST IT WAS NOW MIDNIGHT OF THE FIRST DAY WHAT COURSE OF ACTION COULD SHE DETERMINE UPON WHICH COULD BE ADOPTED IN EIGHT AND FORTY HOURS
AND HE'D UNCOMMONLY LIKE TO SEE ANY MAN OFFER TO DO IT RESPONDED MISTER GRIMWIG KNOCKING HIS STICK UPON THE FLOOR HAVING GONE THUS FAR THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN SEVERALLY TOOK SNUFF
DO ME THE FAVOUR MY DEAR YOUNG LADY TO LEAVE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT GOODNESS AND BENEVOLENCE OF WHICH YOU SPEAK AND OF WHICH NOBODY ELSE KNOWS ANYTHING
BUT WHAT IS THIS OF WHOM DO YOU SPEAK I HAVE SEEN THE GENTLEMAN REPLIED OLIVER SCARCELY ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS SO GOOD TO ME MISTER BROWNLOW THAT WE HAVE SO OFTEN TALKED ABOUT WHERE ASKED ROSE
THAN HE POURED FORTH A SHOWER OF MINGLED THREATS AND EXECRATIONS THREATENED TO MAKE HER THE FIRST VICTIM OF THE COMBINED INGENUITY OF MESSRS BLATHERS AND DUFF AND ACTUALLY PUT ON HIS HAT PREPARATORY TO SALLYING FORTH TO OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF THOSE WORTHIES
TO DEPOSIT IN THE LOCAL SAVINGS BANK THE SUM OF FIVE AND TWENTY POUNDS FOR HIS SOLE USE AND BENEFIT AT THIS THE TWO WOMEN SERVANTS LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS AND EYES AND SUPPOSED THAT MISTER GILES PULLING OUT HIS SHIRT FRILL REPLIED NO NO
AND WHO CAN WONDER IF IT BE SO MOTHER REJOINED THE YOUNG MAN OR WHY SHOULD I SAY IF IT IS IT IS YOU KNOW IT MOTHER YOU MUST KNOW IT
AND WERE WITHAL AS ORIGINAL AND AS MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AS THE REMARKS OF GREAT MEN COMMONLY ARE ABOVE STAIRS THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY FOR THE DOCTOR WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND HOWEVER FATIGUED OR THOUGHTFUL HARRY MAYLIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT FIRST
WHETHER HE LIVED THERE AND THEY SAID HE DID LOOK HERE SAID OLIVER OPENING A SCRAP OF PAPER HERE IT IS HERE'S WHERE HE LIVES I'M GOING THERE DIRECTLY OH DEAR ME DEAR ME WHAT SHALL I DO WHEN I COME TO SEE HIM AND
IN A WORD CRIED THE GENTLEMAN BETTER OR WORSE BETTER MUCH BETTER REPLIED OLIVER HASTILY THANK HEAVEN EXCLAIMED THE GENTLEMAN YOU ARE SURE QUITE SIR REPLIED OLIVER THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE ONLY A FEW HOURS AGO
MISSUS MAYLIE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUSLY INFORMED OF ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED THESE PRELIMINARIES ADJUSTED ROSE AND OLIVER RETURNED HOME ROSE HAD BY NO MEANS OVERRATED THE MEASURE OF THE GOOD DOCTOR'S WRATH NANCY'S HISTORY WAS NO SOONER UNFOLDED TO HIM
CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER IT WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH HAPPINESS TO BEAR
HE JERKED HIMSELF AS IT WERE BY A CONVULSION INTO HIS FORMER ATTITUDE AND LOOKING OUT STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM EMITTED A LONG DEEP WHISTLE WHICH SEEMED AT LAST
HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE STEPS OF THE CHAISE SUPPORTING AN ELBOW ON EACH KNEE AND WIPING HIS EYES WITH A BLUE COTTON POCKET HANDKERCHIEF DOTTED WITH WHITE SPOTS THAT THE HONEST FELLOW HAD NOT BEEN FEIGNING EMOTION
I WOULD RATHER WALK SLOWLY ON SO AS TO GAIN A LITTLE TIME BEFORE I SEE HER YOU CAN SAY I AM COMING I BEG YOUR PARDON MISTER HARRY SAID GILES GIVING A FINAL POLISH TO HIS RUFFLED COUNTENANCE WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF BUT IF YOU WOULD LEAVE THE POSTBOY TO SAY THAT
AND AFTERWARDS SHOOK HANDS ACCORDING TO THEIR INVARIABLE CUSTOM NOW MISS MAYLIE SAID MISTER BROWNLOW TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT IN WHICH YOUR HUMANITY IS SO MUCH INTERESTED
AND IN EXACT PROPORTION TO HIS SUCCESS IN THE WORLD BE CAST IN HIS TEETH AND MADE THE SUBJECT OF SNEERS AGAINST HIM HE MAY NO MATTER HOW GENEROUS AND GOOD HIS NATURE
WHAT GOOD SHOULD WE BRING ABOUT HANGING A FEW OF THEM AT LEAST IN ALL PROBABILITY SUGGESTED THE DOCTOR AND TRANSPORTING THE REST VERY GOOD REPLIED MISTER BROWNLOW SMILING
I KNOW THAT SHE DESERVES THE BEST AND PUREST LOVE THE HEART OF MAN CAN OFFER SAID MISSUS MAYLIE I KNOW THAT THE DEVOTION AND AFFECTION OF HER NATURE REQUIRE NO ORDINARY RETURN BUT ONE THAT SHALL BE DEEP AND LASTING IF I DID NOT FEEL THIS
THAT YOUTH HAS MANY GENEROUS IMPULSES WHICH DO NOT LAST AND THAT AMONG THEM ARE SOME WHICH BEING GRATIFIED BECOME ONLY THE MORE FLEETING ABOVE ALL I THINK SAID THE LADY FIXING HER EYES ON HER SON'S FACE THAT IF AN ENTHUSIASTIC
IF IT BE PAINFUL TO HIM SHE THOUGHT TO COME BACK HERE HOW PAINFUL IT WILL BE TO ME BUT PERHAPS HE WILL NOT COME HE MAY WRITE OR HE MAY COME HIMSELF AND STUDIOUSLY ABSTAIN FROM MEETING ME HE DID WHEN HE WENT AWAY
EVEN IF SHE HAD KNOWN HOW TO DO SO IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE THOUGHT OF FOR THE SAME REASON ONCE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HER OF SEEKING ASSISTANCE FROM HARRY BUT THIS AWAKENED THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR LAST PARTING AND IT SEEMED UNWORTHY OF HER TO CALL HIM BACK WHEN
ARE IN THE RIGHT BUT THE SOMBRE COLOURS ARE REFLECTIONS FROM THEIR OWN JAUNDICED EYES AND HEARTS THE REAL HUES ARE DELICATE AND NEED A CLEARER VISION IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK AND OLIVER DID NOT FAIL TO NOTE IT AT THE TIME THAT HIS MORNING EXPEDITIONS WERE NO LONGER MADE ALONE
WHICH OCCASIONED HIM NO LITTLE SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY ROSE ALSO EXPLAINED HER REASONS FOR NOT CONFIDING IN HER FRIEND MISTER LOSBERNE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE OLD GENTLEMAN CONSIDERED THAT SHE HAD ACTED PRUDENTLY
THERE THERE AT THE WINDOW CLOSE BEFORE HIM SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD HAVE ALMOST TOUCHED HIM BEFORE HE STARTED BACK WITH HIS EYES PEERING INTO THE ROOM AND MEETING HIS THERE STOOD THE JEW AND BESIDE HIM WHITE WITH RAGE OR FEAR OR BOTH
WILL HAVE BEGUN TO THINK BY THIS TIME THAT WE HAVE WEARIED OF HIS COMPANY AND ENTERED INTO SOME DARK CONSPIRACY TO THRUST HIM FORTH UPON THE WORLD
I SHALL SURPRISE YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID ROSE NATURALLY EMBARRASSED BUT YOU ONCE SHOWED GREAT BENEVOLENCE AND GOODNESS TO A VERY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND OF MINE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL TAKE AN INTEREST IN HEARING OF HIM AGAIN
ACCOMMODATE THEMSELVES WITH SURPRISING READINESS TO OUR VISIONS UNTIL REALITY AND IMAGINATION BECOME SO STRANGELY BLENDED THAT IT IS AFTERWARDS ALMOST MATTER OF IMPOSSIBILITY TO SEPARATE THE TWO
DO YOU STILL SUPPOSE THAT I AM A BOY IGNORANT OF MY OWN MIND AND MISTAKING THE IMPULSES OF MY OWN SOUL I THINK MY DEAR SON RETURNED MISSUS MAYLIE LAYING HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER
IF YOU BURIED HIM FIFTY FEET DEEP AND TOOK ME ACROSS HIS GRAVE I FANCY I SHOULD KNOW IF THERE WASN'T A MARK ABOVE IT
THE TEARS ROSE TO HER EYES AS SHE PURSUED THIS TRAIN OF REFLECTION HE MIGHT HAVE BY THIS TIME LEARNT TO FORGET HER AND TO BE HAPPIER AWAY DISTURBED BY THESE DIFFERENT REFLECTIONS INCLINING NOW TO ONE COURSE AND THEN TO ANOTHER
HAS ALWAYS BEEN HER CHARACTERISTIC WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT I LEAVE YOU TO DISCOVER REPLIED MISSUS MAYLIE I MUST GO BACK TO HER GOD BLESS YOU I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT SAID THE YOUNG MAN EAGERLY
AND SOME SLIGHT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR KINDNESS TO OLIVER NOT EXACTLY THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW LAUGHING BUT WE MUST PROCEED GENTLY AND WITH GREAT CARE GENTLENESS AND CARE EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR
AND AGAIN RECOILING FROM ALL AS EACH SUCCESSIVE CONSIDERATION PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER MIND ROSE PASSED A SLEEPLESS AND ANXIOUS NIGHT AFTER MORE COMMUNING WITH HERSELF NEXT DAY SHE ARRIVED AT THE DESPERATE CONCLUSION OF CONSULTING HARRY
THERE IS SOMETHING IN YOUR MANNER WHICH WOULD ALMOST IMPLY THAT SHE WILL HEAR ME COLDLY MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN NOT COLDLY REJOINED THE OLD LADY FAR FROM IT HOW THEN
NOR IS THIS THE MOST STRIKING PHENOMENON INCIDENTAL TO SUCH A STATE IT IS AN UNDOUBTED FACT THAT ALTHOUGH OUR SENSES OF TOUCH AND SIGHT BE FOR THE TIME DEAD YET OUR SLEEPING THOUGHTS AND THE VISIONARY SCENES THAT PASS BEFORE US
HAVE YOU SHOT ANYTHING PARTICULAR LATELY GILES INQUIRED THE DOCTOR WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED NOTHING PARTICULAR SIR REPLIED MISTER GILES COLOURING UP TO THE EYES NOR CATCHING ANY THIEVES NOR IDENTIFYING ANY HOUSE BREAKERS
AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES LIKE MISFORTUNES SELDOM COME ALONE HER SITUATION WAS INDEED ONE OF NO COMMON TRIAL AND DIFFICULTY
OLIVER COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT THE WITHERED FLOWERS WERE NEVER THROWN AWAY ALTHOUGH THE LITTLE VASE WAS REGULARLY REPLENISHED NOR COULD HE HELP OBSERVING THAT WHENEVER THE DOCTOR CAME INTO THE GARDEN HE INVARIABLY CAST HIS EYES UP TO THAT PARTICULAR CORNER
INDEED SAID MISTER BROWNLOW OLIVER TWIST YOU KNEW HIM AS REPLIED ROSE THE WORDS NO SOONER ESCAPED HER LIPS
SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RINGING THE BELL SEND MISSUS BEDWIN HERE IF YOU PLEASE THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH ALL DISPATCH AND DROPPING A CURTSEY AT THE DOOR WAITED FOR ORDERS WHY YOU GET BLINDER EVERY DAY BEDWIN
AND IT WAS LATE BEFORE THEY RETIRED WITH LIGHT AND THANKFUL HEARTS TO TAKE THAT REST OF WHICH AFTER THE DOUBT AND SUSPENSE THEY HAD RECENTLY UNDERGONE THEY STOOD MUCH IN NEED OLIVER ROSE NEXT MORNING IN BETTER HEART
SAID THE IMPETUOUS DOCTOR WHEN THEY HAD REJOINED THE TWO LADIES ARE WE TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO ALL THESE VAGABONDS MALE AND FEMALE AND BEG THEM TO ACCEPT A HUNDRED POUNDS OR SO APIECE AS A TRIFLING MARK OF OUR ESTEEM
GOD BE GOOD TO ME CRIED THE OLD LADY EMBRACING HIM IT IS MY INNOCENT BOY MY DEAR OLD NURSE CRIED OLIVER HE WOULD COME BACK I KNEW HE WOULD SAID THE OLD LADY HOLDING HIM IN HER ARMS HOW WELL HE LOOKS
THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF ANY MISTAKE ON YOUR PART MY BOY IS THERE DEMANDED THE GENTLEMAN IN A TREMULOUS VOICE DO NOT DECEIVE ME BY AWAKENING HOPES THAT ARE NOT TO BE FULFILLED I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD SIR REPLIED OLIVER INDEED YOU MAY BELIEVE ME
WHETHER YOU THINK IT REASONABLE THAT THIS PROMISE TO THE GIRL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BINDING A PROMISE MADE WITH THE BEST AND KINDEST INTENTIONS BUT REALLY DO NOT DISCUSS THE POINT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY PRAY SAID MISTER BROWNLOW INTERRUPTING ROSE AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK
SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RATHER TESTILY WELL THAT I DO SIR REPLIED THE OLD LADY PEOPLE'S EYES AT MY TIME OF LIFE DON'T IMPROVE WITH AGE SIR I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW
MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN IMPATIENTLY HE WOULD BE A SELFISH BRUTE UNWORTHY ALIKE OF THE NAME OF MAN AND OF THE WOMAN YOU DESCRIBE WHO ACTED THUS YOU THINK SO NOW HARRY REPLIED HIS MOTHER AND EVER WILL SAID THE YOUNG MAN
AND THAT YOUR ARRIVAL HERE A DAY SOONER OR A DAY LATER
THERE IS A KIND OF SLEEP THAT STEALS UPON US SOMETIMES WHICH WHILE IT HOLDS THE BODY PRISONER DOES NOT FREE THE MIND FROM A SENSE OF THINGS ABOUT IT AND ENABLE IT TO RAMBLE AT ITS PLEASURE SO FAR AS AN OVERPOWERING HEAVINESS A PROSTRATION OF STRENGTH
WERE THE SCOWLING FEATURES OF THE MAN WHO HAD ACCOSTED HIM IN THE INN YARD
AND AN UTTER INABILITY TO CONTROL OUR THOUGHTS OR POWER OF MOTION CAN BE CALLED SLEEP THIS IS IT AND YET WE HAVE A CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THAT IS GOING ON ABOUT US AND IF WE DREAM AT SUCH A TIME WORDS WHICH ARE REALLY SPOKEN OR SOUNDS WHICH REALLY EXIST AT THE MOMENT
OLIVER FELT STUNNED AND STUPEFIED BY THE UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE HE COULD NOT WEEP OR SPEAK OR REST HE HAD SCARCELY THE POWER OF UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING THAT HAD PASSED UNTIL AFTER A LONG RAMBLE IN THE QUIET EVENING AIR
YET LEFT HER CHAMBER AND THERE WERE NO EVENING WALKS SAVE NOW AND THEN FOR A SHORT DISTANCE WITH MISSUS MAYLIE HE APPLIED HIMSELF WITH REDOUBLED ASSIDUITY TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE WHITE HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN AND LABOURED SO HARD THAT HIS QUICK PROGRESS SURPRISED EVEN HIMSELF
AND THE PROSPECT IT COMMANDED WAS VERY EXTENSIVE ONE BEAUTIFUL EVENING WHEN THE FIRST SHADES OF TWILIGHT WERE BEGINNING TO SETTLE UPON THE EARTH OLIVER SAT AT THIS WINDOW INTENT UPON HIS BOOKS HE HAD BEEN PORING OVER THEM FOR SOME TIME
THESE WERE ALL REASONS FOR THE GREATEST CAUTION AND MOST CIRCUMSPECT BEHAVIOUR IN COMMUNICATING IT TO MISSUS MAYLIE WHOSE FIRST IMPULSE WOULD INFALLIBLY BE TO HOLD A CONFERENCE WITH THE WORTHY DOCTOR ON THE SUBJECT AS TO RESORTING TO ANY LEGAL ADVISER
BUT I MET WITH A CURE FOR IT MY BROTHER KEPT ME UP TO HEAR HIS LEARNED LECTURE TILL AFTER TWO O'CLOCK AND I SPENT ALL MY ILL HUMOUR UPON HIM AND YET WE PARTED VERY QUIETLY
HERE COMES THE NOTE AGAIN TO TELL YOU I CANNOT CALL ON YOU TO NIGHT I CANNOT HELP IT AND YOU MUST TAKE IT AS PATIENTLY AS YOU CAN BUT I AM ENGAGED TO NIGHT AT THE THREE RINGS TO SUP AND PLAY
THE GRIZZLY OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WHO WOBBLES ON HIS HIND LEGS AND LICKS HIMSELF WITH A TONGUE FULL OF BLOOD
PREFERRED TERRA FIRMA WE ARE AFRAID WE MUST MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT IN OUR HERO THERE WERE TWO VERY DISTINCT CHARACTERS
ARE SOON SPOTTED AN ACCOMMODATION LIAR SOON LEARNS TO RUN LIKE AN EXPRESS A GUILTY CONSCIENCE NEEDS NO ACCUSER IF YOU CATCH HIM AT IT A AN ADJECTIVE
WELL MY MASTER REMEMBER LAST NIGHT YOU SWAGGERED LIKE A YOUNG LORD
SATURDAY I CONFESS WAS DEVOTED TO MY LADY BUT YESTERDAY
AND A NAME HAS BEEN GIVEN HIM RAPID IS WHAT THEY CALL HIM
IN HIS LEFT HAND
THAT I COULD RISE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT HIS KINDLY COLLABORATION ONE DAY WHILE IN NEW YORK I WENT UP TO THE FIFTY NINTH FLOOR OF A SKY REMOVER BUILDING THE ELEVATOR WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS THAT DAY
WRITES M SANTOS SEE PAGE NINETY SEVEN WAS FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO RISE IN THE WORLD WHEN BUT A LITTLE BOY MY DEAREST WISH WAS TO GET UP TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER AND THEN HAVE SOMEONE REMOVE THE LADDER
BUT FINALLY WEARY OF AWAITING THEM AND CERTAIN THEY WOULD NOT SHOW THEMSELVES HE WOULD FLING A LAST GLARE OF DEFIANCE INTO THE SHADES
IN A FRENZIED EFFORT TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME MY PUBLISHER THEN YELLED FEVERISHLY FOR A PRINTER ENCLOSED PLEASE FIND THE RESULT IN THE MEANTIME HOWEVER
CONSTANTLY HOPED THAT BEYOND THE TURN OF ONE OF THESE CUT THROATS HAUNTS THEY WOULD LEAP FROM THE SHADOW AND FALL ON HIS BACK I WARRANT YOU THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WARMLY RECEIVED THOUGH
AND WITH A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HIS HEAD HE WOULD TRANSLATE HIS READINGS INTO ACTION AND GOADING HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN VOICE
AND DON'T PUT ME OFF WITH A BIT OF A NOTE NOW YOU COULD WRITE ME A FINE LONG LETTER WHEN I DID NOT DESERVE IT HALF SO WELL
WHICH SETS A TOPER LAUGHING AND SINGING AFTER THAT WHEN THOROUGHLY BRACED UP THEY RISE WHISTLE THE DOGS TO HEEL SET THE GUNS ON HALF COCK AND GO ON THE SHOOT
SWEETLY SMELLING AND WITH THE PLAY OF LIGHT ON WATERED SILK UPON ITS UNCTUOUS SURFACE AND WITH SUCCULENT GRILLED STEAK FLAVOURED WITH ANISE SEED
EVERY SUNDAY MORNING OUT HE WOULD MARCH IN A NEW CAP AND BACK HE WOULD STRUT EVERY SUNDAY EVENING WITH A MERE THING OF SHREDS THE LOFT OF BAOBAB VILLA
QUICKLY GLANCING TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT ERE BANGING THE DOOR TO AND FASTENING IT SMARTLY WITH DOUBLE LOCKING THEN ON THE WAY NOT SO MUCH AS A CAT UPON THE AVIGNON ROAD
AND SHOUTING UP AND AT EM
AND TAKING HIS FINGERS OFF THE PUBLIC PULSE DON'T YOU NOAH LOTT CHESTNUT HILL
THIS LIFE IN A PETTY TOWN WEIGHED UPON HIM AND SUFFOCATED HIM THE GREAT MAN OF TARASCON WAS BORED IN TARASCON
VIOLENTLY AND ABRUPTLY SO THAT IT SHOULD SLAM AGAINST THE OUTER WALL IF THEY HAD BEEN SKULKING BEHIND IT YOU MAY WAGER THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN JAM
PASS THE BUTTER T L THE LIMIT PREFACE SOME EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO I TOOK THIS BRILLIANT BUNCH OF BRAIN BURRS TO MY ESTEEMED PUBLISHER
HE PLAYED SUCH A CAPITAL KNIFE AND FORK ON GAME OF ALL KINDS SO WAS THE LEGISLATURE ON TARTARIN'S SIDE TWO OR THREE TIMES IN OPEN COURT THE OLD CHIEF JUDGE
WHO CARRIED IN HIS FRAME THE SOUL OF DON QUIXOTE THE SAME CHIVALRIC IMPULSES
ABSOLUTE DEARTH STUPID AS THE BRUTE CREATION IS YOU CAN READILY UNDERSTAND THAT IN TIME IT LEARNT SOME DISTRUST
IF I STAYED UP I KNEW I WAS SUCCESSFUL IF I CAME DOWN I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR A WEEK OR TWO THE READER WILL NOTICE A PECULIARITY ABOUT THIS GENTLEMAN'S NAME
ALL THE DOORS CLOSED AND NO LIGHTS IN THE CASEMENTS
SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS WORTH OF GLORY AND ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS WORTH OF FAME TOUGH ISN'T IT I THINK MY PUBLISHER SHOULD BE CENSURED FOR GOING OUT GOLFING
HE HAD NOT EVEN TAKEN THAT OBLIGATORY TRIP TO MARSEILLES
IT STARTS OFF WITH M AND THEN THERE IS EIGHT BARS REST UNTIL IT COMES TO SANTOS THIS IS A FRENCH CUSTOM EVERY MAN IN FRANCE BEGINS HIS FIRST NAME WITH M
TO AVOID ANY DROPPINGS FROM WINDOWS AS HAPPENS AFTER DARK IN TARASCON AND THE OLD TOWN OF EDINBURGH
TO IMITATE FOR INSTANCE THE MAN WHO IMITATES HIS BETTERS IS THE EASIEST MAN TO MAKE A MONKEY OF APPLAUSE THE FUSS WHICH WE THINK THE WORLD OUGHT TO MAKE OVER US
SAVE ONE OLD ROGUE OF A HARE ESCAPED BY MIRACLE FROM THE MASSACRES WHO IS STUBBORNLY DETERMINED TO STICK TO IT ALL HIS LIFE HE IS VERY WELL KNOWN AT TARASCON
ALONG THE WATERSIDE
AND THE REST OF THE TIME TO LADLE OUT CASTING VOTES AT THE GUNMAKER'S
THE SILLY SYCLOPEDIA A TERRIBLE THING IN THE FORM OF A LITERARY TORPEDO WHICH IS LAUNCHED FOR HILARIOUS PURPOSES ONLY INACCURATE IN EVERY PARTICULAR CONTAINING COPIOUS ETYMOLOGICAL DERIVATIONS
WAS A STOUT HONEST BULLY OF A BODY VERY FAT VERY WEIGHTY MOST SENSUAL AND FOND OF CODDLING HIGHLY TOUCHY FULL OF LOW CLASS APPETITE AND HOMELY REQUIREMENTS
THE CHINESE TIGER EQUIPPING HIMSELF FOR COMBAT OR THE COMANCHE WARRIOR PAINTING UP FOR GOING ON THE WAR PATH ALL HANDS MAKE READY FOR ACTION AS THE MEN OF WAR'S MEN SAY
BUT THIS SHORT FLYING TRIP MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION UPON MY MIND AND OTHERWISE TEN YEARS LATER I LEFT HOME JUST TO CONVINCE MY FATHER
I WAS PAINED AND SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THAT MY STOMACH DID NOT TRAVEL WITH ME
IN THE RIGHT HE CARRIED A SWORD CANE IN HIS LEFT POCKET A LIFE PRESERVER IN THE RIGHT A REVOLVER
TOLD ME IF I DID NOT LIKE IT TO GET OUT AND FLY THAT WAS THE INSPIRATION WHICH DROVE ME TO BUILD THE FLYING MACHINE
I COMPLAINED BITTERLY TO HIM ABOUT SUCH AN INHUMAN INVENTION WHICH RUSHED THROUGH SPACE WITH A MAN'S EXTERIOR AND LEFT HIS INTERIOR TO BUMP ITS WAY DOWNSTAIRS
CAN YOU ENDURE THAT WORD NO OUT UPON'T I'LL SEE YOU ANON
BETWIXT OUTER AND UNDER GARMENT LAY A MALAY KREESE BUT NEVER ANY POISONED ARROWS THEY ARE WEAPONS ALTOGETHER TOO UNFAIR BEFORE STARTING
NOT SO MUCH AS A DOG OR A DRUNKEN MAN NOTHING AT ALL STILL THERE WERE FALSE ALARMS SOMEWHILES HE WOULD CATCH A SOUND OF STEPS AND MUFFLED VOICES WARE HAWKS
THERE ARE EVEN SOME HATTERS WHO SELL HUNTING CAPS READY SHOT TORN AND PERFORATED FOR THE BAD SHOTS BUT THE ONLY BUYER KNOWN IS THE CHEMIST BEZUQUET
AND LOOK'D AS IF A LITTLE GOOD FORTUNE MIGHT MAKE US GOOD FRIENDS BUT YOUR SPECIAL FRIEND MY ELDER BROTHER I HAVE A STORY TO TELL YOU OF HIM WILL MY COUSIN F COME THINK YOU
EXCEPT FOR THE PARISH LAMPS WELL SPACED APART BLINKING IN THE RIVER MIST CALM AND PROUD
HAS DOUBLED AY TRIPLED THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY BUT NOBODY HAS YET MANAGED TO LAY HIM LOW AT PRESENT
IT'S UP TO YOU I F M I'M FROM MISSOURI M M T S MAKE MINE THE SAME N G NICE GENTLEMAN O T L ON THE LEVEL P D Q
HE AT ONCE REACHED OVER AND GRABBED THE PUBLIC PULSE TO HIS ASTONISHMENT
RINGING HIS HEELS WITH REGULARITY AND SENDING SPARKS OUT OF THE PAVING STONES
I HAVE A HEART STILL THAT CANNOT RESOLVE TO REFUSE YOU ANYTHING WITHIN ITS POWER TO GRANT BUT LORD WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU
I FIND MY CONSCIENCE A LITTLE TROUBLED TILL I HAVE ASKED YOUR PARDON FOR MY ILL HUMOUR LAST NIGHT WILL YOU FORGIVE IT ME IN EARNEST I COULD NOT HELP IT
A MUSICAL TERM WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED HERE BECAUSE THE MUSICAL UNION MIGHT GET SORE A FLAT A PEOPLE COOP SEVEN ROOMS AND A LANDLORD WITH HOT AND COLD GAS AND RUNNING SERVANTS
ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT EVERY MAN PLUCKS OFF HIS CAP SHIES IT UP WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
THE DAUNTLESS ONE WOULD LINGER YET A MOMENT
AND BAD DREAMS A LIQUID SUBSTANCE WHICH WHEN APPLIED TO A HOLDOVER REVIVIFIES IT AND ENABLES ITS OWNER TO SIT UP AND NOTICE THE BAR TENDER ABSTAIN
COULD YOU NOT STAY TILL THEY ARE ALL GONE TO ROEHAMPTON THEY GO THIS MORNING I DO BUT ASK THOUGH DO WHAT YOU PLEASE ONLY BELIEVE YOU DO A GREAT INJUSTICE IF YOU THINK ME FALSE
MY COLD WOULD NOT SUFFER ME BUT KEPT ME PRISONER ALL THE DAY I WENT TO YOUR LODGING TO TELL YOU THAT VISITING THE SICK WAS PART OF THE WORK OF THE DAY BUT YOU WERE GONE AND SO I WENT TO BED AGAIN
BUTT IN C O CATCH ON D T L DOWN THE LINE E S EASY STREET I T N IN THE NECK
IN READINESS TO SPRING FORWARD WHILST UTTERING HIS WAR CRY WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN OUT OF THE THICK OF THE MURKINESS
FOR DOING OUR DUTY AUTOMOBILE A HORSELESS IDEA WHICH MAKES PEOPLE GO FAST AND THE MONEY GO FASTER A TIDE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MAN WHICH TAKEN BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES AND THE CURBSTONE
WOULD MUTTER AMONG ONE ANOTHER IN ADMIRATION NOW THERE'S A POWERFUL CHAP IF YOU LIKE HE HAS DOUBLE MUSCLES DOUBLE MUSCLES WHY YOU NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING OUTSIDE OF TARASCON
NOW ONLY LET EM COME THEM WHO WERE THEY TARTARIN DID NOT HIMSELF ANY TOO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THEY WAS ALL THAT SHOULD BE ATTACKED AND FOUGHT WITH
THE VERY BIRDS OF PASSAGE HAVE TICKED IT OFF ON THEIR GUIDE BOOKS AND WHEN THE WILD DUCKS COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE CAMARGUE IN LONG TRIANGLES
A MACHINE INVENTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FLYING THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS SEE M SANTOS DUMONT IN CASE HE ISN'T IN WHEN YOU CALL A PART OF HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS PRINTED HEREWITH MY FIRST YEARNING
TOGETHER WITH A HURLY BURLY OF HOUNDS CRACKING OF WHIPS AND BLOWING OF WHISTLES AND HUNTING HORNS IT'S SPLENDID TO SEE UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LACK OF GAME AN
A WILD ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT WHICH DREAMT OF NOTHING BUT BATTLES RACES ACROSS THE PAMPAS MIGHTY BATTUES DESERT SANDS BLIZZARDS AND TYPHOONS IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO GO OUT EVERY SUNDAY TO POP AT A CAP
BUT ALACK BY REASON OF SOME NASTY MEANNESS OF DESTINY
AND YET THE PRETTY HILLOCKS ARE MIGHTILY TEMPTING SWEET SMELLING AS THEY ARE OF MYRTLE LAVENDER AND ROSEMARY AND THE FINE MUSCATELS PLUMPED OUT WITH SWEETNESS EVEN UNTO BURSTING
WITH HIS RIDDLED CAP ON THE END OF HIS GUN BARREL AMID ANY QUANTITY OF DOG BARKS AND HORN BLASTS IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT CAP SELLING IS A FINE BUSINESS IN THE TOWN
INCLUDED BEAUCAIRE AND YET THAT'S NOT FAR FROM TARASCON THERE BEING MERELY THE BRIDGE TO GO OVER UNFORTUNATELY THIS RASCALLY BRIDGE HAS SO OFTEN BEEN BLOWN AWAY BY THE GALES IT IS SO LONG AND FRAIL
THE HARD WORK A MAN DOES ON THE GOLF LINKS TO GIVE HIMSELF AN APPETITE FOR SAUSAGE LINKS ANGEL SOMETHING BEHIND A SHOW AND ALWAYS SOMETHING BEHIND APE
JUMPED OVER THE FENCE CLIMBED A TELEGRAPH POLE BURST ITS CYLINDER HEAD EXPLODED ALL ITS TIRES AND THEN TURNED AROUND AND BARKED AT ME ABBREVIATIONS USED IN THIS WORK
ALL THAT BITES CLAWS SCALPS WHOOPS AND YELLS
WHETHER IN AVENUES STREETS OR LANES HE TOOK CARE TO KEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AN EXCELLENT METHOD OF PRECAUTION ALLOWING ONE TO SEE DANGER COMING AND ABOVE ALL
NOW I HAVE GOT THE TRICK OF BREAKING MY WORD I SHALL DO IT EVERY DAY I MUST GO TO ROEHAMPTON TO DAY BUT TIS ALL ONE YOU DO NOT CARE MUCH FOR SEEING ME
WHAT STRIFE WHAT CLAPPER CLAWING OH THE FINE DIALOGUE FOR LUCIAN OR SAINT EVREMOND TO WRITE BETWEEN THE TWO TARTARINS
GOOD NIGHT OLD FELLOW MALEDICTIONS UPON IT IT WAS THE CHEMIST BEZUQUET WITH HIS FAMILY COMING FROM SINGING THEIR FAMILY BALLAD AT COSTECALDE'S OH GOOD EVEN GOOD EVEN
AND HAD READ ALL THE HANDBOOKS OF ALL POSSIBLE KINDS OF VENERY FROM CAP POPPING TO BURMESE TIGER SHOOTING THE SPORTSMEN CONSTITUTED HIM THEIR GREAT CYNEGETICAL JUDGE
THE STEPS WOULD DRAW NEARER AND THE VOICES GROW MORE DISTINCT TILL NO MORE DOUBT WAS POSSIBLE THEY WERE COMING IN FACT HERE THEY WERE
A FLAT IS THE POOR RELATION OF AN APARTMENT ABROAD A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE GO TO BE CURED OF VISITING FOREIGN LANDS ABSCOND TO DUCK WITH THE DOUGH
SEND ME WORD IT MAYBE TWAS A COMPLIMENT IF I CAN SEE YOU THIS MORNING I WILL BUT I DARE NOT PROMISE IT
HE HAD BECOME THE SWELL BRUISER THE ARISTOCRATIC PUGILIST THE CRACK BULLY OF THE LOCAL CORINTHIANS FOR THE TARASCONERS FROM HIS BUILD BEARING STYLE THAT ASPECT OF A GUARD'S
CALLED FOR AND DEFIED THEM NEVER DID THEY COME ODSBODDIKINS WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE COME TO DO IN TARASCON NEVERTHELESS TARTARIN ALWAYS EXPECTED TO RUN UP AGAINST THEM
ALTHOUGH YOUR TARASCONER IS VERY SLIGHTLY SUPERSTITIOUS NATURALLY AND WOULD EAT COCK ROBINS ON TOAST OR THE SWALLOW WHICH IS OUR LADY'S OWN BIRD FOR THAT MATTER IF HE COULD FIND ANY BUT THAT WON'T DO
ACCORDING TO WHAT HE IS LOADED FOR THE MAN WHO LODGES MOST SHOT IN HIS CAP IS HAILED AS KING OF THE HUNT AND STALKS BACK TRIUMPHANTLY AT DUSK INTO TARASCON
AND MURMURING I MEAN TO STAY AT HOME THE DUET
FOR THAT IS A FACT UP TO THE AGE OF FIVE AND FORTY THE DREADLESS TARASCONIAN
UNHAPPILY THEY WERE NOT THERE THE WAY BEING OPEN
STEADY WITH EYE AFIRE AND HEAVING BREAST
LASTLY
AND SOME LITTLE TO FORGET HIS CLUB AND THE MARKET PLACE IN VAIN DID HE PILE WEAPON UPON WEAPON AND MALAY KREESE UPON MALAY KREESE IN VAIN DID HE CRAM WITH ROMANCES
IF WITH THESE DIRECTIONS YOU CAN FIND IT OUT YOU WILL THERE FIND ONE THAT IS VERY MUCH YOUR SERVANT
WITH HIS CAP ON THE MUZZLE OF HIS GUN AND HIS FUSTIAN SHOOTING JACKET BELTED IN TIGHTLY THE STURDY RIVER LIGHTERMEN WOULD RESPECTFULLY BOB AND BLINKING TOWARDS THE HUGE BICEPS SWELLING OUT HIS ARMS
FROM THE GREATEST TO THE LEAST THE CHASE IS THE LOCAL CRAZE AND SO IT HAS EVER BEEN SINCE THE MYTHOLOGICAL TIMES WHEN THE TARASQUE AS THE COUNTY DRAGON WAS CALLED
THERE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TEDIUM IN IT TO KILL HIM WITH CONSUMPTION IN VAIN DID HE SURROUND HIMSELF WITH BAOBABS AND OTHER AFRICAN TREES TO WIDEN HIS HORIZON
I AM ABED STILL AND SLEPT SO SOUNDLY NOTHING BUT YOUR LETTER COULD HAVE WAKED ME YOU SHALL HEAR FROM ME AS SOON AS WE HAVE DINED FAREWELL
UNTIL WE GET USED TO IT ALCOHOL THE FOREFATHER OF A HOLD OVER BOOZERINE IN THE RAW STATE FROM THE LATIN WORDS ALCO AND HAUL MEANING
THEY GO OUT INTO THE REAL COUNTRY TWO OR THREE LEAGUES FROM TOWN THEY GATHER IN KNOTS OF FIVE OR SIX
ABOVE ALL SELF CONTROL
AS THEY SPREAD ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RHONE ARE DEUCEDLY TEMPTING TOO TRUE TRUE BUT TARASCON LIES BEHIND ALL THIS AND TARASCON IS DOWN IN THE BLACK BOOKS OF THE WORLD OF FUR AND FEATHER
ONE THAT COULD GET THROUGH TWENTY NIGHTS WITHOUT ITS BREAST PLATE BEING UNBUCKLED OFF AND FORTY EIGHT HOURS ON A HANDFUL OF RICE ON THE CONTRARY
LEADS ON TO THE HOSPITAL AXE GRINDING THE ART PRACTICED BY THOSE WHO GIVE YOU A COOKIE SO THEY CAN TOUCH YOU FOR A BARREL OF FLOUR THE AXE GRINDING INDUSTRY
SOME FATHER OF THE CHURCH HAS SAID I FEEL THERE ARE TWO MEN IN ME
ARMING HIMSELF CAPA PIE TO GO TO HIS CLUB AT NINE
GAVE ME A FAIRLY GOOD CIGAR AND BEGAN TO LOOK HARD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ELEVATOR LAST WEEK WHILE SEARCHING FOR SOME MISSING GOVERNMENT BONDS
AND STOP SHORT AS IF TAKING ROOT ON THE SPOT SCRUTINISING THE GLOOM SNIFFING THE WIND EVEN GLUEING HIS EAR TO THE GROUND IN THE ORTHODOX RED INDIAN MODE
POOR MAN I AM SORRY FOR YOU IN EARNEST I SHALL BE QUITE SPOILED I SEE NO REMEDY THINK WHETHER IT WERE NOT BEST TO LEAVE ME AND BEGIN A NEW ADVENTURE
I NEVER RESOLV'D TO GIVE YOU AN ETERNAL FAREWELL BUT I RESOLV'D AT THE SAME TIME TO PART WITH ALL THE COMFORT OF MY LIFE AND WHETHER I TOLD IT YOU OR NOT I SHALL DIE YOURS
HAUL HIM TO THE ALCOVE SEE LORD MACAULAY'S JAGS OF ANCIENT ROME AMBITION THE ONLY DISEASE WHICH LAZINESS CAN CURE AMUSEMENT
THE MALAY PIRATE THE BRIGAND OF THE ABRUZZI IN SHORT THEY WAS WARFARE TRAVEL ADVENTURE AND GLORY BUT ALAS IT WAS TO NO AVAIL THAT THE FEARLESS TARASCONER
OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS THROUGH THE TWIGS OF HIS BAOBAB THE TEMPEST OF GREAT VOYAGES AND JOURNEYS
HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN THE SERPENT WAS EXTREMELY PARTIAL TO AUTUMN SO HE GAVE EVE A NICE RED APPLE AND IN EXCHANGE SHE GAVE THE SERPENT AN EARLY FALL
WHEN HE WAS READING ALONE AMIDST HIS BLADES POINTS AND EDGES HOW MANY TIMES DID HE DASH DOWN HIS BOOK AND RUSH TO THE WALL TO UNHOOK A DEADLY ARM THE POOR MAN FORGOT HE WAS AT HOME IN TARASCON IN HIS UNDERCLOTHES
COMMONLY CALLED THE INDEFINITE ARTICLE BECAUSE THE HIGHER THE FEWER A BAS
PEOPLE WILL THINK ME MAD IF I GO ABROAD THIS MORNING AFTER HAVING SEEN ME IN THE CONDITION I WAS IN LAST NIGHT AND THEY WILL THINK IT STRANGE TO SEE YOU HERE
IN THE SILENCE AND OBSCURITY OF HIS STUDY HE EXERCISED HIMSELF FOR A WHILE WARDING OFF IMAGINARY CUTS AND THRUSTS LUNGING AT THE WALL AND GIVING HIS MUSCLES PLAY THEN HE TOOK HIS MASTER KEY
HAPPENED WHILE I WAS EXTREMELY YOUNG ONE DAY WHILE OUT IN THE BRAZILIAN DIAMOND FIELDS PICKING THE LUSCIOUS WHITE STONES FROM THE TREES IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME WHAT A FRIVOLOUS LIFE I WAS LEADING
BUT YET HE WAS EVEN THEN THE COCK OF THE WALK AT TARASCON LET US SHOW WHENCE AROSE THIS SOVEREIGNTY IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS SHOOTING MAD IN THESE PARTS
THE BRAVE COMMANDANT BRAVIDA HONORARY CAPTAIN RETIRED IN THE MILITARY CLOTHING FACTORY DEPARTMENT CALLED HIM A GAME FELLOW AND YOU MAY WELL ADMIT THAT THE WARRIOR KNEW ALL ABOUT GAME FELLOWS
FROM THE LATIN WORD ABSCONDITTO MEANING TO GRAB THE LONG GREEN AND HIKE FOR THE BAD LANDS ABSINTHE THE NATIONAL HEADACHE OF THE FRENCH A JAG BUILDER WHICH IS MOSTLY WORMWOOD
IN THE CAR WAS A CHAUFFEUR AND AN OLD GENTLEMAN WITH SNOWY SIDE WHISKERS AND A SCOTCH PLAID CAP WHICH COULD NOT BE WORN WHILE AUTOMOBILING EXCEPT BY A PERSONAGE NOT EVEN A WINE AGENT WOULD DARE DO IT
HIS HOME WAS DISMANTLED
TO NIGHT JOHN PERKINS ENCOUNTERED A TREMENDOUS UPHEAVAL OF THE COMMONPLACE WHEN HE REACHED HIS DOOR NO KATY WAS THERE WITH HER AFFECTIONATE CONFECTIONATE KISS THE THREE ROOMS SEEMED IN PORTENTOUS DISORDER
NOW WHERE ARE YOU GOING I'D LIKE TO KNOW JOHN PERKINS
SHE WAS A GRAND EXAMPLE OF KRAFT'S THEORY OF THE ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE SHE BELONGED LARGELY TO WAITING AS MINERVA DID TO THE ART OF SCRAPPING OR VENUS TO THE SCIENCE OF SERIOUS FLIRTATION
AND THE WILD MEN OF THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE EAST IN KHAKI THERE IS LITTLE TELLING THEM ONE FROM ANOTHER SO THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS AND COMRADES ALL AROUND ELLSWORTH REMSEN WHOSE OLD KNICKERBOCKER DESCENT
WHO SAT BY THE WINDOW SMOKING CIGARS I WISH YOU AND THE REST OF THE POLICE FORCE AND ALL BADGES HORSES BRASS BUTTONS AND MEN WHO CAN'T DRINK TWO GLASSES OF BRUT WITHOUT GETTING UPSET WERE AT THE DEVIL SAID REMSEN FEELINGLY
WINSOME WAITRESS WINS WEALTHY WISCONSIN WOODSMAN FOR A WHILE WE FELT THAT MILLY WAS ON THE VERGE OF BEING LOST TO US IT WAS OUR LOVE OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE THAT INSPIRED US
MORE EXQUISITE THAN THE FIRST QUARTER MOON VIEWED AT TWILIGHT THROUGH THE TOPS OF OLEANDERS REMSEN SAW HER AND KNEW HIS FATE HE COULD HAVE FLUNG HIMSELF UNDER THE VERY WHEELS THAT CONVEYED HER
BUT HE KNEW THAT WOULD BE THE LAST MEANS OF ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO RIDE IN MOTOR CARS SLOWLY THE AUTO PASSED AND IF WE PLACE THE POETS ABOVE THE AUTOISTS CARRIED THE HEART OF REMSEN WITH IT
LUCKILY FOR REMSEN'S PEACE OF MIND THERE CAME A DIVERSION IN THE GUISE OF A REUNION OF THE GENTLE RIDERS OF THE CITY THERE WERE NOT MANY OF THEM PERHAPS A SCORE AND THERE WAS WASSAIL AND THINGS TO EAT
BUT KNOWING HE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE ANYTHING ELSE AT THE END OF THE DAY REMSEN SENT THE CHESTNUT TO HIS STABLE AND WENT TO O'ROON'S ROOM THE POLICEMAN WAS AGAIN A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN
AND HE WILL MARRY MILLY NEVER EXCLAIMED JUDKINS AND I IN HORROR A LUMBERMAN REPEATED KRAFT HOARSELY AND A MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN I SIGHED DESPAIRINGLY FROM WISCONSIN GROANED JUDKINS
BECAUSE HE HAD A NAME TO GIVE WHICH WITHOUT UNDUE PRIDE WAS WORTHY OF BEING SPOKEN IN HIGH PLACES AND A SMALL FORTUNE WHICH WITH DUE PRIDE HE COULD LEAVE AT HIS END WITHOUT DISGRACE HE OPENED HIS LIPS TO SPEAK
OF AN ESSENCE GONE OF ITS SOUL AND LIFE DEPARTED JOHN PERKINS STOOD AMONG THE DEAD REMAINS WITH A QUEER FEELING OF DESOLATION IN HIS HEART HE BEGAN TO SET THE ROOMS TIDY AS WELL AS HE COULD
THERE HE RUMBLED A ROUGHLY GOOD HUMOURED PROTEST THAT'S THE GIRL FOR MY MONEY HE DECLARED SHE CAN EAT OUT OF MY SKILLET THE REST OF HER LIFE WHY I NEVER SEE SUCH A FINE GIRL I'M GOING BACK THERE AND ASK HER TO MARRY ME
WITH A SINKING HEART JOHN SAW THE COMB WITH A CURLING CLOUD OF HER BROWN HAIR AMONG ITS TEETH SOME UNUSUAL HURRY AND PERTURBATION MUST HAVE POSSESSED HER
YES THERE WAS THE CITY ROARING OUTSIDE FOR JOHN PERKINS TO COME DANCE IN THE TRAIN OF MOMUS AND AT MC CLOSKEY'S THE BOYS WERE KNOCKING THE BALLS IDLY INTO THE POCKETS AGAINST THE HOUR FOR THE NIGHTLY GAME BUT NO PRIMROSE WAY
IF YOU DAMAGED THAT HORSE OF MINE I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU I'M GOING TO BUY HIM AND TAKE HIM BACK WITH ME OH YES AND I THINK MY SISTER LADY ANGELA YOU KNOW WANTS PARTICULARLY FOR YOU TO COME UP TO THE HOTEL WITH ME THIS EVENING
DON'T FORGET TO WRITE TO THE COMPANY ABOUT THE GAS METER AND YOUR GOOD SOCKS ARE IN THE TOP DRAWER I WILL WRITE TO MORROW HASTILY KATY NEVER DURING THEIR TWO YEARS OF MATRIMONY
THE TWO RODE SIDE BY SIDE DURING THE FAMOUS MOOTED UP HILL CHARGE THAT WAS DISPUTED SO HOTLY AT THE TIME BY THE SPANIARDS AND AFTERWARD BY THE DEMOCRATS AFTER THE WAR REMSEN CAME BACK TO HIS POLO AND SHAD
THE PENDULUM EIGHTY FIRST STREET LET EM OUT PLEASE YELLED THE SHEPHERD IN BLUE A FLOCK OF CITIZEN SHEEP SCRAMBLED OUT AND ANOTHER FLOCK SCRAMBLED ABOARD
OF LATE SUCH HAD BEEN JOHN PERKINS'S HABIT AT TEN OR ELEVEN HE WOULD RETURN SOMETIMES KATY WOULD BE ASLEEP SOMETIMES WAITING UP
AND YET SOMEHOW I COULD NEVER THINK OF HER AS EXISTING OUTSIDE OF CYPHER'S THERE NATURE HAD PLACED HER AND SHE HAD TAKEN ROOT AND GROWN MIGHTILY
SUCH AS DRINK POLICEMEN HORSES AND EARLDOMS DURING A CERTAIN WAR A TROOP CALLING ITSELF THE GENTLE RIDERS RODE INTO HISTORY AND ONE OR TWO AMBUSCADES THE GENTLE RIDERS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE WILD MEN OF THE WEST
NOR CLICKING CUE COULD WOO THE REMORSEFUL SOUL OF PERKINS THE BEREFT THE THING THAT WAS HIS LIGHTLY HELD AND HALF SCORNED HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM AND HE WANTED IT BACKWARD TO A CERTAIN MAN NAMED ADAM
I NEVER GOT OFF THE TRAIN SINCE I MUSHED OUT OF SEATTLE AND I'M HUNGRY THE STUFF THE NIGGERS FEED YOU ON PULLMANS DON'T COUNT YOU GENTLEMEN ORDER WHAT YOU WANT AND THEN MILLY LOOMED UP WITH A THOUSAND DISHES ON HER BARE ARM
WITH YOUR BADGE ON YOUR HORSE IN YOUR UNIFORM WILL I CHARM NURSE MAIDS AND PREVENT THE GRASS FROM GROWING UNDER PEOPLE'S FEET IN THE PARK THIS DAY I WILL HAVE YOUR BADGE AND YOUR HONOR BESIDES HAVING THE JOLLIEST LARK I'VE BEEN BLESSED WITH SINCE WE LICKED SPAIN
HIS LEGS DECLINED TO FULFIL THE OBLIGATIONS THEY HAD SWORN TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT I'M STEWED REMSEN SAID O'ROON TO HIS FRIEND WHY DO THEY BUILD HOTELS THAT GO ROUND AND ROUND LIKE CATHERINE WHEELS
HER SLEEVES WERE ALWAYS ROLLED ABOVE HER ELBOWS SHE COULD HAVE TAKEN US THREE MUSKETEERS IN HER TWO HANDS AND DROPPED US OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE HAD SEEN FEWER YEARS THAN ANY OF US BUT SHE WAS OF SUCH SUPERB EVEHOOD AND SIMPLICITY THAT SHE MOTHERED US FROM THE BEGINNING
SPEAK I INTERRUPTED MUCH PERTURBED YOU DO NOT THINK THAT MILLY WILL BEGIN TO LACE ONE DAY CONCLUDED KRAFT SOLEMNLY THERE WILL COME TO CYPHER'S FOR A PLATE OF BEANS A MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN FROM WISCONSIN
THE JANITOR WOULD DRIVE MISSUS ZANOWITSKI'S FIVE CHILDREN ONCE MORE ACROSS THE YALU THE LADY WITH THE CHAMPAGNE SHOES AND THE SKYE TERRIER WOULD TRIP DOWNSTAIRS AND PASTE HER THURSDAY NAME OVER HER BELL AND LETTER BOX
MILLY STEERED HER MAGNIFICENT WAY LIKE SOME GREAT LINER CLEAVING AMONG THE CANOES OF HOWLING SAVAGES OUR GODDESS OF GRUB WAS BUILT ON LINES SO MAJESTIC THAT THEY COULD BE FOLLOWED ONLY WITH AWE
WITH A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR A WEEK CONTRACT THEN THE GENT AT THE WINDOW ACROSS THE AIR SHAFT WOULD GET OUT HIS FLUTE THE NIGHTLY GAS LEAK WOULD STEAL FORTH TO FROLIC IN THE HIGHWAYS THE DUMBWAITER WOULD SLIP OFF ITS TROLLEY
WHEN HE TOUCHED HER CLOTHES A THRILL OF SOMETHING LIKE TERROR WENT THROUGH HIM HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT WHAT EXISTENCE WOULD BE WITHOUT KATY SHE HAD BECOME SO THOROUGHLY ANNEALED INTO HIS LIFE THAT SHE WAS LIKE THE AIR HE BREATHED
SLOWLY BECAUSE IN THE LEXICON OF HIS DAILY LIFE THERE WAS NO SUCH WORD AS PERHAPS THERE ARE NO SURPRISES AWAITING A MAN WHO HAS BEEN MARRIED TWO YEARS AND LIVES IN A FLAT AS HE WALKED
JOHN SEIZED IT IT WAS A NOTE FROM HIS WIFE RUNNING THUS DEAR JOHN I JUST HAD A TELEGRAM SAYING MOTHER IS VERY SICK
WE WERE AT OUR SUPPER OF BEEF STEW AND DRIED APPLES WHEN HE TROTTED IN AS IF ON THE HEELS OF A DOG TEAM AND MADE ONE OF THE MESS AT OUR TABLE
IT CAME JUST AS REMSEN WAS STROLLING INTO FIFTH AVENUE FROM HIS CLUB A FEW DOORS AWAY A MOTOR CAR WAS CREEPING ALONG FOOT BY FOOT IMPEDED BY A FRESHET OF VEHICLES THAT FILLED THE STREET
ALONG THE DRIVEWAY IN THE EARLY MORNING SPUN A VICTORIA DRAWN BY A PAIR OF FIERY BAYS THERE WAS SOMETHING FOREIGN ABOUT THE AFFAIR
JOHN SAT AT A FRONT WINDOW HE DID NOT CARE TO SMOKE OUTSIDE THE CITY ROARED TO HIM TO COME JOIN IN ITS DANCE OF FOLLY AND PLEASURE THE NIGHT WAS HIS
ALL ABOUT LAY HER THINGS IN CONFUSION SHOES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR CURLING TONGS HAIR BOWS KIMONOS POWDER BOX JUMBLED TOGETHER ON DRESSER AND CHAIRS THIS WAS NOT KATY'S WAY
THEY WERE ASKING HIS NAME AND BESTOWING UPON HIM WELLBRED THANKS FOR HIS HEROIC DEED AND THE SCOTCH CAP WAS ESPECIALLY BABBLING AND INSISTENT BUT THE ELOQUENT APPEAL WAS IN THE EYES OF THE LADY A LITTLE THRILL OF SATISFACTION RAN THROUGH REMSEN
ONE DAY A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN DISTURBED HIM AT HIS CLUB AND HE AND O'ROON WERE SOON POUNDING EACH OTHER AND EXCHANGING OPPROBRIOUS EPITHETS AFTER THE MANNER OF LONG LOST FRIENDS
THEN SAID I WHEN YOU LED US AGAINST THE LUMBERMAN THE KLONDIKER IT WASN'T ALTOGETHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE WELL
WE HAD NO CREDIT WE WENT IN CALLED FOR FOOD AND ATE IT WE PAID OR WE DID NOT PAY WE HAD CONFIDENCE IN CYPHER'S SULLENNESS AND SMOULDERING FEROCITY
I'M A DOUBLE DYED DUB MUSED JOHN PERKINS THE WAY I'VE BEEN TREATING KATY OFF EVERY NIGHT PLAYING POOL AND BUMMING WITH THE BOYS INSTEAD OF STAYING HOME WITH HER THE POOR GIRL HERE ALL ALONE WITH NOTHING TO AMUSE HER AND ME ACTING THAT WAY
WITH THE FREEDOM OF THE CAMPS HE ASSAULTED OUR EARS AND CLAIMED THE FELLOWSHIP OF MEN LOST IN THE WILDS OF A HASH HOUSE WE EMBRACED HIM AS A SPECIMEN AND IN THREE MINUTES WE HAD ALL BUT DIED FOR ONE ANOTHER AS FRIENDS
DEEP DOWN IN HIS SUNLESS SOUL HE WAS EITHER A PRINCE A FOOL OR AN ARTIST HE SAT AT A WORM EATEN DESK COVERED WITH FILES OF WAITERS CHECKS SO OLD THAT I WAS SURE THE BOTTOMEST ONE WAS FOR CLAMS THAT HENDRIK HUDSON HAD EATEN AND PAID FOR
THREE YEARS AGO KRAFT BILL JUDKINS A POET AND I TOOK OUR MEALS AT CYPHER'S ON EIGHTH AVENUE I SAY TOOK WHEN WE HAD MONEY CYPHER GOT IT OFF OF US AS HE EXPRESSED IT
I LOOKED BACK AND SAW HIM SHAKING WITH INAUDIBLE LAUGHTER BEHIND HIS FILM NOW AND THEN WE PAID UP BACK SCORES BUT THE CHIEF THING AT CYPHER'S WAS MILLY MILLY WAS A WAITRESS
MADE COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO A LONELY MEAL FACE TO FACE WITH THE STRAWBERRY MARMALADE'S SHAMELESS CERTIFICATE OF PURITY BRIGHT AMONG WITHDRAWN BLESSINGS NOW APPEARED TO HIM THE GHOSTS OF POT ROASTS AND THE SALAD WITH TAN POLISH DRESSING
FOR SHE ALWAYS CAREFULLY PLACED THESE COMBINGS IN THE LITTLE BLUE VASE ON THE MANTEL TO BE SOME DAY FORMED INTO THE COVETED FEMININE RAT HANGING CONSPICUOUSLY TO THE GAS JET BY A STRING WAS A FOLDED PAPER
AND THE BOTTLE OF STRAWBERRY MARMALADE BLUSHING AT THE CERTIFICATE OF CHEMICAL PURITY ON ITS LABEL AFTER DINNER KATY WOULD SHOW HIM THE NEW PATCH IN HER CRAZY QUILT THAT THE ICEMAN HAD CUT FOR HER OFF THE END OF HIS FOUR IN HAND
ONCE WHEN WE LEFT HIM UNPAID
JOHN PERKINS YOU'RE THE WORST KIND OF A SHINE I'M GOING TO MAKE IT UP FOR THE LITTLE GIRL I'LL TAKE HER OUT AND LET HER SEE SOME AMUSEMENT AND I'LL CUT OUT THE MC CLOSKEY GANG RIGHT FROM THIS MINUTE
THE COTTON HAS ITS BOLLWORM THE CHORUS GIRL HAS HER PITTSBURGER THE SUMMER BOARDER HAS HIS POISON IVY THE HERO HAS HIS CARNEGIE MEDAL ART HAS ITS MORGAN THE ROSE HAS ITS
HE WAS RUGGED AND BEARDED AND WIND DRIED HE HAD JUST COME OFF THE TRAIL HE SAID AT ONE OF THE NORTH RIVER FERRIES I FANCIED I COULD SEE THE SNOW DUST OF CHILCOOT YET POWDERING HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN HE STREWED THE TABLE WITH THE NUGGETS
AT HALF PAST SEVEN THEY WOULD SPREAD NEWSPAPERS OVER THE FURNITURE TO CATCH THE PIECES OF PLASTERING THAT FELL WHEN THE FAT MAN IN THE FLAT OVERHEAD BEGAN TO TAKE HIS PHYSICAL CULTURE EXERCISES EXACTLY AT EIGHT
HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR ALL HIS NEGLECT WHAT WAS LIFE WITHOUT HER THE DOOR OPENED KATY WALKED IN CARRYING A LITTLE HAND SATCHEL JOHN STARED AT HER STUPIDLY MY I'M GLAD TO GET BACK SAID KATY
THERE ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR HUNG PATHETICALLY EMPTY AND FORMLESS THE RED WRAPPER WITH BLACK DOTS THAT SHE ALWAYS WORE WHILE GETTING THE MEALS HER WEEK DAY CLOTHES HAD BEEN TOSSED HERE AND THERE IN HER HASTE
HE MIGHT GO FORTH UNQUESTIONED AND THRUM THE STRINGS OF JOLLITY AS FREE AS ANY GAY BACHELOR THERE HE MIGHT CAROUSE AND WANDER AND HAVE HIS FLING UNTIL DAWN IF HE LIKED AND THERE WOULD BE NO WRATHFUL KATY WAITING FOR HIM
ONE OF THE TROOPERS WAS A WELL SET UP AFFABLE COOL YOUNG MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF O'ROON TO THIS YOUNG MAN REMSEN TOOK AN ESPECIAL LIKING
HE HIT UNERRINGLY UPON THE KEYNOTE OF HIS DISCOMFORT HE KNEW NOW THAT KATY WAS NECESSARY TO HIS HAPPINESS HIS FEELING FOR HER LULLED INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY THE DULL ROUND OF DOMESTICITY
WHICH COULD NOT BE WORN WHILE DRIVING EXCEPT BY A PERSONAGE AT HIS SIDE SAT THE LADY OF REMSEN'S HEART THE LADY WHO LOOKED LIKE POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS AND THE GIBBOUS MOON REMSEN MET THEM COMING
MA WASN'T SICK TO AMOUNT TO ANYTHING
AND MANY WOMEN WHO AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE APPEAR TO RESEMBLE POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS YET HE HOPED TO SEE HER AGAIN FOR EACH ONE FANCIES THAT HIS ROMANCE HAS ITS OWN TUTELARY GUARDIAN AND DIVINITY
OUR PATHS SEPARATED AND I SAW KRAFT NO MORE AND JUDKINS SELDOM BUT AS I SAID I SAW A PAINTING THE OTHER DAY THAT WAS SOLD FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE TITLE WAS BOADICEA
O'ROON LOOKED SEEDY AND OUT OF LUCK AND PERFECTLY CONTENTED BUT IT SEEMED THAT HIS CONTENT WAS ONLY APPARENT GET ME A JOB REMSEN HE SAID I'VE JUST HANDED A BARBER MY LAST SHILLING
AND SPEECHES AND THE SPANIARD WAS BEARDED AGAIN IN RECAPITULATION AND WHEN DAYLIGHT THREATENED THEM THE SURVIVORS PREPARED TO DEPART BUT SOME REMAINED UPON THE BATTLEFIELD ONE OF THESE WAS TROOPER O'ROON WHO WAS NOT SEASONED TO POTENT LIQUIDS
TWO WHO SOMEWHAT RESEMBLE EACH OTHER IN FEATURE AND FIGURE WILL APPEAR AS TWIN BROTHERS SO REMSEN TROTTED DOWN THE BRIDLE PATHS ENJOYING HIMSELF HUGELY SO FEW REAL PLEASURES DO TEN MILLIONAIRES HAVE
HAD BEEN SHARPLY STIRRED BY THE LOSS OF HER PRESENCE HAS IT NOT BEEN DINNED INTO US BY PROVERB AND SERMON AND FABLE THAT WE NEVER PRIZE THE MUSIC TILL THE SWEET VOICED BIRD HAS FLOWN
IT STILL RETAINED SOMETHING OF HER CONTOUR MIDWAY OF THE SLEEVES WERE FINE INDIVIDUAL WRINKLES MADE BY THE MOVEMENTS OF HER ARMS IN WORKING FOR HIS COMFORT AND PLEASURE A DELICATE BUT IMPELLING ODOR OF BLUEBELLS CAME FROM IT
PROMPTLY ON TIME THE COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENT OF MOUNTED POLICEMAN O'ROON SINGLE FOOTED INTO THE PARK ON HIS CHESTNUT STEED IN A UNIFORM TWO MEN WHO ARE UNLIKE WILL LOOK ALIKE
DON'T MENTION IT HE SAID STOLIDLY WE POLICEMEN ARE PAID TO DO THESE THINGS IT'S OUR DUTY AND HE RODE AWAY
STUFFED PTARMIGANS BEAD WORK AND SEAL PELTS OF THE RETURNED KLONDIKER AND BEGAN TO PRATE TO US OF HIS MILLIONS BANK DRAFTS FOR TWO MILLIONS WAS HIS SUMMING UP
THERE AMID THE STEAM OF VEGETABLES AND THE VAPOURS OF ACRES OF HAM AND THE CRASH OF CROCKERY THE CLATTER OF STEEL THE SCREAMING OF SHORT ORDERS THE CRIES OF THE HUNGERING AND ALL THE HORRID TUMULT OF FEEDING MAN
HICKEY AND MOONEY OF THE VAUDEVILLE TEAM UNBOOKED IN THE FLAT ACROSS THE HALL WOULD YIELD TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF DELIRIUM TREMENS AND BEGIN TO OVERTURN CHAIRS UNDER THE DELUSION THAT HAMMERSTEIN WAS PURSUING THEM
YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THE DIAMOND TIARAS ON MILLY'S BROW AND THE HAND EMBROIDERED SILK PARIS GOWNS THAT HE MEANT TO BUY FOR HER AT LAST THE BOLLWORM HAD ATTACKED THE COTTON THE POISON IVY WAS REACHING OUT ITS TENDRILS TO ENTWINE THE SUMMER BOARDER
THE PAINTER WAS A YOUNG SCRUB OUT OF THE WEST NAMED KRAFT WHO HAD A FAVOURITE FOOD AND A PET THEORY HIS PABULUM WAS AN UNQUENCHABLE BELIEF IN THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE
READY TO MELT IN THE CRUCIBLE OF HER IRE A LITTLE MORE GOLD PLATING FROM THE WROUGHT STEEL CHAINS OF MATRIMONY FOR THESE THINGS CUPID WILL HAVE TO ANSWER WHEN HE STANDS AT THE BAR OF JUSTICE WITH HIS VICTIMS FROM THE FROGMORE FLATS
AH YOU'RE ALL RIGHT O'ROON COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT MORE NEATLY
THUS THE WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH HIS OWN GUNS WE DROVE HIM FROM THE FIELD AND THEN WE HAD HIM CARTED TO A DISTANT SMALL HOTEL AND PUT TO BED WITH HIS NUGGETS AND BABY SEAL SKINS STUFFED AROUND HIM HE WILL NEVER FIND CYPHER'S AGAIN SAID KRAFT
AND SCOTCH CAP FROM POSSIBLE DEATH WHERE WAS POLICEMAN O'ROON OFF HIS BEAT EXPOSED DISGRACED DISCHARGED
TO THE EXQUISITE CONGRUITY BETWEEN MILLY AND CYPHER'S THERE IS A CERTAIN FATE HANGING OVER MILLY SAID KRAFT AND IF IT OVERTAKES HER SHE IS LOST TO CYPHER'S AND TO US SHE WILL GROW FAT
THE MILLIONAIRE LUMBERMAN THINLY DISGUISED AS THE ALASKAN MINER WAS ABOUT TO ENGULF OUR MILLY AND UPSET NATURE'S ADJUSTMENT KRAFT WAS THE FIRST TO ACT HE LEAPED UP AND POUNDED THE KLONDIKER'S BACK COME OUT AND DRINK HE SHOUTED
THIS I SAY HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO AND ABOUT THAT TIME A LITTLE LUCK DESCENDED UPON US THREE AND WE WERE ENABLED TO BUY COSTLIER AND LESS WHOLESOME FOOD THAN CYPHER'S
REMSEN LINGERING WAS DIMLY CONSCIOUS OF A VAGUE IMPOSSIBLE UNNECESSARY OLD GENTLEMAN IN A SCOTCH CAP WHO TALKED INCESSANTLY ABOUT SOMETHING AND HE WAS ACUTELY CONSCIOUS OF A PAIR OF VIOLET EYES
THE BADGE OF POLICEMAN O'ROON IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE LOOKED UPON ONE ANOTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME AND BECOME INSTANTLY ENAMORED IT IS A RISKY PROCESS THIS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
ASKED JUDKINS FEARSOMELY SHE WILL GO TO NIGHT SCHOOL AND BECOME REFINED I VENTURED ANXIOUSLY IT IS THIS SAID KRAFT PUNCTUATING IN A PUDDLE OF SPILLED COFFEE WITH A STIFF FOREFINGER CAESAR HAD HIS BRUTUS
BEARING THE CHALICE THAT HELD THE DREGS OF HIS JOY HE MIGHT PLAY POOL AT MC CLOSKEY'S WITH HIS ROISTERING FRIENDS UNTIL AURORA DIMMED THE ELECTRIC BULBS IF HE CHOSE
A LITTLE PAPER BAG OF HER FAVORITE BUTTER SCOTCH LAY WITH ITS STRING YET UNWOUND A DAILY PAPER SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR GAPING RECTANGULARLY WHERE A RAILROAD TIME TABLE HAD BEEN CLIPPED FROM IT EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM SPOKE OF A LOSS
HER VOICE RANG LIKE A GREAT SILVER BELL HER SMILE WAS MANY TOOTHED AND FREQUENT SHE SEEMED LIKE A YELLOW SUNRISE ON MOUNTAIN TOPS I NEVER SAW HER BUT I THOUGHT OF THE YOSEMITE
KRAFT WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR SUCH A POLITE BARBED INSULT RELATING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE MISERLY WITH THEIR FUNDS THAT THE MINER CRASHED DOWN HANDFUL AFTER HANDFUL OF SILVER AND NOTES CALLING FOR ALL THE FLUIDS IN THE WORLD TO DROWN THE IMPUTATION
BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF THE VERY HAND OF DEATH HAD POINTED A FINGER AT HIS SECURE AND UNEVENTFUL HOME JOHN DRAGGED THE COLD MUTTON FROM THE ICE BOX
THE BAYS HAD BOLTED REMSEN SENT HIS CHESTNUT AFTER THE VICTORIA LIKE A SHOT THERE WAS WORK CUT OUT FOR THE IMPERSONATOR OF POLICEMAN O'ROON THE CHESTNUT RANGED ALONGSIDE THE OFF BAY THIRTY SECONDS AFTER THE CHASE BEGAN
AND NOW AT THE EXTREME RISK OF WEARYING OLD GENTLEMEN WHO CARRY LEATHER FOB CHAINS AND ELDERLY LADIES WHO BUT NO GRANDMOTHER HERSELF YET THRILLS AT FOOLISH IMMORTAL ROMEO THERE MUST BE A HINT OF LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
ATONED FOR HIS MODEST RATING AT ONLY TEN MILLIONS ATE HIS CANNED BEEF GAYLY BY THE CAMPFIRES OF THE GENTLE RIDERS THE WAR WAS A GREAT LARK TO HIM SO THAT HE SCARCELY REGRETTED POLO AND PLANKED SHAD
THAT WOULD HAVE DRAWN SAINT PYRITES FROM HIS IRON PILLAR OR WHATEVER THE ALLUSION IS AND OF THE LADY'S SMILE AND LOOK A LITTLE FRIGHTENED BUT A LOOK THAT WITH THE EVER COWARD HEART OF A TRUE LOVER HE COULD NOT YET CONSTRUE
AND THE FIGURE SEEMED TO FILL ALL OUT OF DOORS BUT OF ALL THE PICTURE'S ADMIRERS WHO STOOD BEFORE IT I BELIEVE I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO LONGED FOR BOADICEA TO STALK FROM HER FRAME BRINGING ME CORNED BEEF HASH WITH POACHED EGG
LOOMED UP BIG AND WHITE AND PINK AND AWFUL AS MOUNT SAINT ELIAS WITH A SMILE LIKE DAY BREAKING IN A GULCH AND THE KLONDIKER THREW DOWN HIS PELTS AND NUGGETS AS DROSS AND LET HIS JAW FALL HALF WAY AND STARED AT HER
I GUESS SHE WON'T WANT TO SLING HASH ANY MORE WHEN SHE SEES THE PILE OF DUST I'VE GOT YOU'LL TAKE ANOTHER WHISKEY AND MILK NOW KRAFT PERSUADED WITH SATAN'S SMILE I THOUGHT YOU UP COUNTRY FELLOWS WERE BETTER SPORTS
I'D LIKE TO BE ONE OF THOSE BOBBIES ON HORSEBACK THAT WOULD BE ABOUT THE TICKET BESIDES IT'S THE ONLY THING I COULD DO I CAN RIDE A LITTLE AND THE FRESH AIR SUITS ME THINK YOU COULD LAND THAT FOR ME
THE DRIVER RELEASED HIS HANDS FROM THE WRAPPED REINS JUMPED FROM HIS SEAT AND STOOD AT THE HEADS OF THE TEAM THE CHESTNUT APPROVING HIS NEW RIDER DANCED AND PRANCED REVILING EQUINELY THE SUBDUED BAYS
ONCE FORTUNE SMILED UPON THEM STRAIGHT TO NEW YORK THEY HIE AND LAY THEIR GOODS AT THE FEET OF THE GIRL WHO SERVES THEM BEANS IN A BEANERY WHY THE ALPHABET ITSELF CONNIVES THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPER'S HEADLINER'S WORK IS CUT FOR HIM
OF RUSSIANS AND JAPS SLAUGHTERED BY THE DEADLY LINOTYPE FOR DINNER THERE WOULD BE POT ROAST A SALAD FLAVORED WITH A DRESSING WARRANTED NOT TO CRACK OR INJURE THE LEATHER STEWED RHUBARB
DING DING THE CATTLE CARS OF THE MANHATTAN ELEVATED RATTLED AWAY AND JOHN PERKINS DRIFTED DOWN THE STAIRWAY OF THE STATION WITH THE RELEASED FLOCK JOHN WALKED SLOWLY TOWARD HIS FLAT
NECESSARY BUT SCARCELY NOTICED NOW WITHOUT WARNING SHE WAS GONE VANISHED AS COMPLETELY ABSENT AS IF SHE HAD NEVER EXISTED OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS OR AT MOST A WEEK OR TWO
AT THE INSTANT OF THEIR PASSING HER EYES LOOKED INTO HIS AND BUT FOR THE EVER COWARD'S HEART OF A TRUE LOVER HE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT SHE FLUSHED A FAINT PINK
NO TROUBLE AT ALL SAID REMSEN I KNOW A LOT OF MEN WHO HAVE BANKS AND STORES AND THINGS DOWNTOWN ANY PARTICULAR LINE YOU FANCY YES SAID O'ROON WITH A LOOK OF INTEREST I TOOK A WALK IN YOUR CENTRAL PARK THIS MORNING
YOU EXPECTED TO SEE HER COLOSSAL FIGURE LOOM THROUGH THAT REEKING BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE FROM FRYING FAT JUST AS YOU EXPECT THE PALISADES TO APPEAR THROUGH A DRIFTING HUDSON RIVER FOG
OUR FEARS MUST HAVE BEEN PROPHETIC FOR ON THAT SAME EVENING THE WILDWOOD DISCHARGED UPON US MILLY'S PREORDAINED CONFISCATOR OUR FEE TO ADJUSTMENT AND ORDER BUT ALASKA AND NOT WISCONSIN BORE THE BURDEN OF THE VISITATION
BUT THESE TWO WERE OF NO CONSEQUENCE EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR THE GUIDING OF THE MACHINE AND THE PAYING FOR IT AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S SIDE SAT A YOUNG LADY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS
SO THEY TROTTED ON IN SILENCE TILL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF A GREAT CROWD IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH THE LION AND UNICORN WERE FIGHTING THEY WERE IN SUCH A CLOUD OF DUST THAT AT FIRST ALICE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHICH WAS WHICH
HE WENT ON PUTTING HIS ARM AFFECTIONATELY ROUND HATTA'S NECK HATTA LOOKED ROUND AND NODDED AND WENT ON WITH HIS BREAD AND BUTTER WERE YOU HAPPY IN PRISON DEAR CHILD SAID HAIGHA HATTA LOOKED ROUND ONCE MORE
AND IF HIS GRANDMOTHER TOLD THEM STORIES HE ALWAYS INTERRUPTED HER BESIDES IF HE COULD MANAGE IT HE WOULD GET BEHIND HER
WHY I BEAT YOU ALL ROUND THE TOWN YOU CHICKEN THE LION REPLIED ANGRILY HALF GETTING UP AS HE SPOKE HERE THE KING INTERRUPTED TO PREVENT THE QUARREL GOING ON
FOR THE STREAM DRIFTED THE BOAT QUITE NEAR THE LAND GERDA CALLED STILL LOUDER AND AN OLD WOMAN THEN CAME OUT OF THE COTTAGE LEANING UPON A CROOKED STICK SHE HAD A LARGE BROAD BRIMMED HAT ON
THE BOY IS CERTAINLY VERY CLEVER
AND THEN IT MADE ONE SHUDDER FOR THEIR HEART BECAME LIKE A LUMP OF ICE SOME OF THE BROKEN PIECES WERE SO LARGE THAT THEY WERE USED FOR WINDOWPANES THROUGH WHICH ONE COULD NOT SEE ONE'S FRIENDS OTHER PIECES WERE PUT IN SPECTACLES
ASKED THE LITTLE BOY FOR HE KNEW THAT THE HONEY BEES ALWAYS HAVE ONE
THERE WAS AN END OF THIS PLEASURE THE WINDOWS WERE OFTEN FROZEN OVER BUT THEN THEY HEATED COPPER FARTHINGS ON THE STOVE AND LAID THE HOT FARTHING ON THE WINDOWPANE AND THEN THEY HAD A CAPITAL PEEP HOLE QUITE NICELY ROUNDED
THE GLASS THAT WAS STICKING IN HIS HEART WHICH MADE HIM TEASE EVEN LITTLE GERDA WHOSE WHOLE SOUL WAS DEVOTED TO HIM HIS GAMES NOW WERE QUITE DIFFERENT TO WHAT THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN THEY WERE SO VERY KNOWING ONE WINTER'S DAY WHEN THE FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FLYING ABOUT
STRETCHED OUT HER CROOKED STICK TOWARDS THE ROSE BUSHES WHICH BEAUTIFULLY AS THEY WERE BLOWING ALL SANK INTO THE EARTH AND NO ONE COULD TELL WHERE THEY HAD STOOD THE OLD WOMAN FEARED THAT IF GERDA SHOULD SEE THE ROSES SHE WOULD THEN THINK OF HER OWN
OVER SEAS AND MANY LANDS AND BENEATH THEM
NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WAS MANY SAD TEARS WERE SHED AND LITTLE GERDA WEPT LONG AND BITTERLY AT LAST SHE SAID HE MUST BE DEAD
SHE CAME FLYING OUT OF THE WOOD OVER YONDER HOW FAST THOSE QUEENS CAN RUN
TO COME AND GO ONE TO COME AND ONE TO GO
AND THIS TIME A TEAR OR TWO TRICKLED DOWN HIS CHEEK BUT NOT A WORD WOULD HE SAY SPEAK CAN'T YOU HAIGHA CRIED IMPATIENTLY
I SEE SOMEBODY NOW SHE EXCLAIMED AT LAST
SAID THE KING HE'S AN ANGLO SAXON MESSENGER AND THOSE ARE ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDES
STILL THE LITTLE VEHICLE RUSHED ON WITH THE QUICKNESS OF THE WIND
AND SHE RAN ABOUT AMONGST THE FLOWERBEDS AND LOOKED AND LOOKED
THESE MANAGED RATHER BETTER THAN THE FOOT SOLDIERS BUT EVEN THEY STUMBLED NOW AND THEN AND IT SEEMED TO BE A REGULAR RULE THAT
HOWEVER NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR BREATH YOU MAY TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE TOWN I'LL WHISPER IT SAID THE MESSENGER PUTTING HIS HANDS TO HIS MOUTH IN THE SHAPE OF A TRUMPET AND STOOPING
THE LION HAD JOINED THEM WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON HE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND SLEEPY AND HIS EYES WERE HALF SHUT
AND SLOPES WITH SHEEP AND COWS BUT NOT A HUMAN BEING WAS TO BE SEEN PERHAPS THE RIVER WILL CARRY ME TO LITTLE KAY
AND I HAVEN'T SENT THE TWO MESSENGERS EITHER
FOR A MINUTE OR TWO ALICE STOOD SILENT WATCHING HIM SUDDENLY SHE BRIGHTENED UP
THE SNOW QUEEN FIRST STORY WHICH TREATS OF A MIRROR AND OF THE SPLINTERS NOW THEN LET US BEGIN
HE CAN'T DO THAT
AND ONE THE LARGEST OF ALL REMAINED LYING ON THE EDGE OF A FLOWER POT THE FLAKE OF SNOW GREW LARGER AND LARGER
WHAT A FIGHT WE MIGHT HAVE FOR THE CROWN NOW THE UNICORN SAID
WHICH THE POOR KING WAS NEARLY SHAKING OFF HIS HEAD HE TREMBLED SO MUCH
SHE THEN SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT HER HOT TEARS FELL JUST WHERE A ROSE BUSH HAD SUNK AND WHEN HER WARM TEARS WATERED THE GROUND THE TREE SHOT UP SUDDENLY AS FRESH AND BLOOMING AS WHEN IT HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP GERDA KISSED THE ROSES
I NEVER SAW ONE ALIVE BEFORE
AND NOW IT WORKED MUCH MORE EVIL THAN BEFORE FOR SOME OF THESE PIECES WERE HARDLY SO LARGE AS A GRAIN OF SAND AND THEY FLEW ABOUT IN THE WIDE WORLD AND WHEN THEY GOT INTO PEOPLE'S EYES THERE THEY STAYED
EVERY TIME HE WAS GOING TO UNTIE HIS SLEDGE THE PERSON NODDED TO HIM AND THEN KAY SAT QUIET AND SO ON THEY WENT TILL THEY CAME OUTSIDE THE GATES OF THE TOWN THEN THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL SO THICKLY
THEY WERE ALWAYS TRIPPING OVER SOMETHING OR OTHER AND WHENEVER ONE WENT DOWN SEVERAL MORE ALWAYS FELL OVER HIM SO THAT THE GROUND WAS SOON COVERED WITH LITTLE HEAPS OF MEN THEN CAME THE HORSES HAVING FOUR FEET
ON THE TABLE STOOD THE MOST EXQUISITE CHERRIES AND GERDA ATE AS MANY AS SHE CHOSE FOR SHE HAD PERMISSION TO DO SO WHILE SHE WAS EATING THE OLD WOMAN COMBED HER HAIR WITH A GOLDEN COMB
SAID THE MESSENGER QUITE RIGHT SAID THE KING THIS YOUNG LADY SAW HIM TOO SO OF COURSE NOBODY WALKS SLOWER THAN YOU
THAT THEY SEEMED TO FILL THE WHOLE FOREST ALICE GOT BEHIND A TREE FOR FEAR OF BEING RUN OVER AND WATCHED THEM GO BY SHE THOUGHT THAT IN ALL HER LIFE SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SOLDIERS SO UNCERTAIN ON THEIR FEET
AND SHE NO LONGER APPEARED OF ICE AS BEFORE WHEN SHE SAT OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND BECKONED TO HIM IN HIS EYES SHE WAS PERFECT HE DID NOT FEAR HER AT ALL AND TOLD HER THAT HE COULD CALCULATE IN HIS HEAD AND WITH FRACTIONS EVEN
I SEE NOBODY ON THE ROAD
PEEPING INTO THE BAG HAY THEN THE KING MURMURED IN A FAINT WHISPER ALICE WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT IT REVIVED HIM A GOOD DEAL THERE'S NOTHING LIKE EATING HAY WHEN YOU'RE FAINT
IT WAS THE SNOW QUEEN WE HAVE TRAVELLED FAST SAID SHE BUT IT IS FREEZINGLY COLD COME UNDER MY BEARSKIN AND SHE PUT HIM IN THE SLEDGE BESIDE HER WRAPPED THE FUR ROUND HIM AND HE FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE SINKING IN A SNOW WREATH
WE SHALL KNOW MORE THAN WE KNOW NOW BUT TO BEGIN ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WICKED SPRITE INDEED HE WAS THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS OF ALL SPRITES ONE DAY HE WAS IN A VERY GOOD HUMOR FOR HE HAD MADE A MIRROR
IF THEY DID NOT MELT IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS THAT KAY CAME ONE DAY WITH LARGE GLOVES ON AND HIS LITTLE SLEDGE AT HIS BACK AND BAWLED RIGHT INTO GERDA'S EARS I HAVE PERMISSION TO GO OUT INTO THE SQUARE
SAID ALICE SEVERAL THOUSAND I SHOULD THINK FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN THAT'S THE EXACT NUMBER THE KING SAID REFERRING TO HIS BOOK
MANY A WINTER'S NIGHT SHE FLIES THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE TOWN AND PEEPS IN AT THE WINDOWS
AND HER HAIR CURLED AND SHONE WITH A LOVELY GOLDEN COLOR AROUND THAT SWEET LITTLE FACE WHICH WAS SO ROUND AND SO LIKE A ROSE I HAVE OFTEN LONGED FOR SUCH A DEAR LITTLE GIRL SAID THE OLD WOMAN
BUT SHE SOON MANAGED TO DISTINGUISH THE UNICORN BY HIS HORN THEY PLACED THEMSELVES CLOSE TO WHERE HATTA THE OTHER MESSENGER WAS STANDING WATCHING THE FIGHT WITH A CUP OF TEA IN ONE HAND AND A PIECE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN THE OTHER
ALICE TOOK A PIECE TO TASTE BUT IT WAS VERY DRY I DON'T THINK THEY'LL FIGHT ANY MORE TO DAY THE KING SAID TO HATTA GO AND ORDER THE DRUMS TO BEGIN AND HATTA WENT BOUNDING AWAY LIKE A GRASSHOPPER
THIS YOUNG LADY LOVES YOU WITH AN H THE KING SAID INTRODUCING ALICE IN THE HOPE OF TURNING OFF THE MESSENGER'S ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF BUT IT WAS NO USE
AND TWICE AS NATURAL I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE FABULOUS MONSTERS SAID THE UNICORN IS IT ALIVE IT CAN TALK SAID HAIGHA SOLEMNLY
THAT'S FULL OF HAY HAIGHA TOOK A LARGE CAKE OUT OF THE BAG AND GAVE IT TO ALICE TO HOLD WHILE HE GOT OUT A DISH AND CARVING KNIFE
WITH ANGRY LOOKS AT BEING INTERRUPTED IN THEIR FEAST BEFORE SHE DROPPED TO HER KNEES AND PUT HER HANDS OVER HER EARS VAINLY TRYING TO SHUT OUT THE DREADFUL UPROAR IF THAT DOESN'T DRUM THEM OUT OF TOWN SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF
THE LION SAID LYING DOWN AND PUTTING HIS CHIN ON THIS PAWS AND SIT DOWN BOTH OF YOU TO THE KING AND THE UNICORN
NOW YOU WILL HAVE NO MORE KISSES SAID SHE OR ELSE I SHOULD KISS YOU TO DEATH KAY LOOKED AT HER SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL A MORE CLEVER OR A MORE LOVELY COUNTENANCE HE COULD NOT FANCY TO HIMSELF
THAT SUMMER THE ROSES FLOWERED IN UNWONTED BEAUTY THE LITTLE GIRL HAD LEARNED A HYMN
THEN SHE TOOK OFF HER RED SHOES THE MOST PRECIOUS THINGS SHE POSSESSED
HIS NAME IS HAIGHA AND HE LIVES HE LIVES ON THE HILL THE KING REMARKED SIMPLY WITHOUT THE LEAST IDEA THAT HE WAS JOINING IN THE GAME WHILE ALICE WAS STILL HESITATING FOR THE NAME OF A TOWN BEGINNING WITH H
BE GOOD ENOUGH ALICE PANTED OUT AFTER RUNNING A LITTLE FURTHER TO STOP A MINUTE JUST TO GET ONE'S BREATH AGAIN I'M GOOD ENOUGH THE KING SAID
THAT THERE IS NO ROOF LEFT FOR EVERYBODY TO HAVE A LITTLE GARDEN AND WHERE ON THIS ACCOUNT MOST PERSONS ARE OBLIGED TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH FLOWERS IN POTS THERE LIVED TWO LITTLE CHILDREN WHO HAD A GARDEN SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN A FLOWER POT
THE TENDRILS OF THE PEAS HUNG DOWN OVER THE BOXES AND THE ROSE TREES SHOT UP LONG BRANCHES TWINED ROUND THE WINDOWS AND THEN BENT TOWARDS EACH OTHER IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A TRIUMPHANT ARCH OF FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS
THE KING REMARKED IN A FRETFUL TONE
AND LITTLE ROSETREES BESIDES THERE WAS A ROSE IN EACH BOX AND THEY GREW SPLENDIDLY THEY NOW THOUGHT OF PLACING THE BOXES ACROSS THE GUTTER SO THAT THEY NEARLY REACHED FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER AND LOOKED JUST LIKE TWO WALLS OF FLOWERS
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES LOOKED LIKE BOILED SPINACH AND THE BEST PERSONS WERE TURNED INTO FRIGHTS OR APPEARED TO STAND ON THEIR HEADS THEIR FACES WERE SO DISTORTED THAT THEY WERE NOT TO BE RECOGNISED AND IF ANYONE HAD A MOLE
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN HIM THROUGH WITH YOUR HORN YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T HURT HIM THE UNICORN SAID CARELESSLY AND HE WAS GOING ON WHEN HIS EYE HAPPENED TO FALL UPON ALICE HE TURNED ROUND RATHER INSTANTLY
IN THE LARGE HUGE EMPTY SPACE ABOVE HIM AND ON SHE FLEW WITH HIM FLEW HIGH OVER THE BLACK CLOUDS WHILE THE STORM MOANED AND WHISTLED AS THOUGH IT WERE SINGING SOME OLD TUNE
AND OUT OF EACH PEEPED A GENTLE FRIENDLY EYE IT WAS THE LITTLE BOY
BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM THE SNOW DRIFTED AND THE SLEDGE FLEW ON AND SOMETIMES IT GAVE A JERK AS THOUGH THEY WERE DRIVING OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES HE WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED AND HE TRIED TO REPEAT THE LORD'S PRAYER BUT ALL HE COULD DO HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO REMEMBER THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
FOR THE MESSENGER KEPT SKIPPING UP AND DOWN AND WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL AS HE CAME ALONG
HIS NAME WAS KAY HERS WAS GERDA IN SUMMER WITH ONE JUMP THEY COULD GET TO EACH OTHER BUT IN WINTER THEY WERE OBLIGED FIRST TO GO DOWN THE LONG STAIRS AND THEN UP THE LONG STAIRS AGAIN
IT WAS THATCHED AND BEFORE IT TWO WOODEN SOLDIERS STOOD SENTRY AND PRESENTED ARMS WHEN ANYONE WENT PAST GERDA CALLED TO THEM FOR SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE ALIVE BUT THEY OF COURSE DID NOT ANSWER SHE CAME CLOSE TO THEM
THE UNICORN LOOKED DREAMILY AT ALICE AND SAID TALK CHILD
THAT THE LITTLE BOY COULD NOT SEE AN ARM'S LENGTH BEFORE HIM BUT STILL ON HE WENT WHEN SUDDENLY HE LET GO THE STRING HE HELD IN HIS HAND IN ORDER TO GET LOOSE FROM THE SLEDGE
AND THEN HIS GRANDMOTHER PATTED HIS HEAD AND TOLD HIM OTHER STORIES IN THE EVENING WHEN LITTLE KAY WAS AT HOME AND HALF UNDRESSED HE CLIMBED UP ON THE CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND PEEPED OUT OF THE LITTLE HOLE A FEW SNOW FLAKES WERE FALLING
WHERE THE OTHERS ARE PLAYING AND OFF HE WAS IN A MOMENT THERE IN THE MARKET PLACE SOME OF THE BOLDEST OF THE BOYS USED TO TIE THEIR SLEDGES TO THE CARTS AS THEY PASSED BY AND SO THEY WERE PULLED ALONG AND GOT A GOOD RIDE
AND THEN PEOPLE SAW EVERYTHING PERVERTED OR ONLY HAD AN EYE FOR THAT WHICH WAS EVIL THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE VERY SMALLEST BIT HAD THE SAME POWER WHICH THE WHOLE MIRROR HAD POSSESSED SOME PERSONS EVEN GOT A SPLINTER IN THEIR HEART
NO PICTURE BOOK COULD BE GAYER OR MORE BEAUTIFUL GERDA JUMPED FOR JOY AND PLAYED TILL THE SUN SET BEHIND THE TALL CHERRY TREE SHE THEN HAD A PRETTY BED WITH A RED SILKEN COVERLET FILLED WITH BLUE VIOLETS SHE FELL ASLEEP
ALICE ASKED VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT HIS TAKING IT SO QUIETLY
THEY ARE JUST LIKE THE BOX THEY ARE PLANTED IN AND THEN HE GAVE THE BOX A GOOD KICK WITH HIS FOOT
AND STOOD FOR SOME TIME LOOKING AT HER WITH AN AIR OF THE DEEPEST DISGUST
AND HAVE A JOKE THERE THE HIGHER THEY FLEW WITH THE MIRROR THE MORE TERRIBLY IT GRINNED THEY COULD HARDLY HOLD IT FAST HIGHER AND HIGHER STILL THEY FLEW NEARER AND NEARER TO THE STARS WHEN SUDDENLY
CAUGHT HOLD OF THE BOAT WITH HER CROOKED STICK DREW IT TO THE BANK AND LIFTED LITTLE GERDA OUT AND GERDA WAS SO GLAD TO BE ON DRY LAND AGAIN
THE SNOW FLAKES GREW LARGER AND LARGER TILL AT LAST THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE GREAT WHITE FOWLS SUDDENLY THEY FLEW ON ONE SIDE THE LARGE SLEDGE STOPPED AND THE PERSON WHO DROVE ROSE UP IT WAS A LADY
NOW YOU SHALL SEE HOW WELL WE AGREE TOGETHER AND WHILE SHE COMBED LITTLE GERDA'S HAIR THE CHILD FORGOT HER FOSTER BROTHER KAY MORE AND MORE FOR THE OLD WOMAN UNDERSTOOD MAGIC BUT SHE WAS NO EVIL BEING
AND THEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER OWN FLOWERS AND SHE SANG THE VERSE TO THE LITTLE BOY WHO THEN SANG IT WITH HER THE ROSE IN THE VALLEY IS BLOOMING SO SWEET
AND AS HE PERCEIVED HER FRIGHT HE PULLED UP ANOTHER ROSE GOT IN AT THE WINDOW AND HASTENED OFF FROM DEAR LITTLE GERDA AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE BROUGHT HER PICTURE BOOK HE ASKED WHAT HORRID BEASTS HAVE YOU THERE
I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW THE LION GROWLED OUT AS HE LAY DOWN AGAIN THERE WAS TOO MUCH DUST TO SEE ANYTHING WHAT A TIME THE MONSTER IS CUTTING UP THAT CAKE
AND KAY TIED ON HIS SLEDGE AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD AND OFF HE DROVE WITH IT ON THEY WENT QUICKER AND QUICKER INTO THE NEXT STREET AND THE PERSON WHO DROVE TURNED ROUND TO KAY AND NODDED TO HIM IN A FRIENDLY MANNER JUST AS IF THEY KNEW EACH OTHER
SHE'S KEPT NONE FOR HERSELF ANYHOW SAID THE LION
AND HAD AS PLEASANT DREAMS AS EVER A QUEEN ON HER WEDDING DAY THE NEXT MORNING SHE WENT TO PLAY WITH THE FLOWERS IN THE WARM SUNSHINE AND THUS PASSED AWAY A DAY GERDA KNEW EVERY FLOWER AND NUMEROUS AS THEY WERE IT
THE KING SAID WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING ROUND THAT WOOD'S FULL OF THEM
BUT BEFORE SHE COULD DO SO THE BOAT WAS MORE THAN A YARD FROM THE LAND AND WAS GLIDING QUICKLY ONWARD LITTLE GERDA WAS VERY FRIGHTENED AND BEGAN TO CRY BUT NO ONE HEARD HER EXCEPT THE SPARROWS AND THEY COULD NOT CARRY HER TO LAND BUT THEY FLEW ALONG THE BANK
WITH THE POWER OF CAUSING ALL THAT WAS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL WHEN IT WAS REFLECTED THEREIN TO LOOK POOR AND MEAN BUT THAT WHICH WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING AND LOOKED UGLY WAS SHOWN MAGNIFIED AND INCREASED IN UGLINESS IN THIS MIRROR
SHE ASKED AS WELL AS SHE COULD
PAINTED WITH THE MOST SPLENDID FLOWERS POOR LITTLE CHILD SAID THE OLD WOMAN HOW DID YOU GET UPON THE LARGE RAPID RIVER TO BE DRIVEN ABOUT SO IN THE WIDE WORLD AND THEN THE OLD WOMAN WENT INTO THE WATER
THIS SOUNDED NONSENSE BUT ALICE VERY OBEDIENTLY GOT UP AND CARRIED THE DISH ROUND AND THE CAKE DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE PIECES AS SHE DID SO NOW CUT IT UP SAID THE LION
AND THAT NOW ONLY AS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THE WORLD REALLY LOOKED THEY RAN ABOUT WITH THE MIRROR
THE NEXT DAY IT WAS A SHARP FROST AND THEN THE SPRING CAME THE SUN SHONE THE GREEN LEAVES APPEARED THE SWALLOWS BUILT THEIR NESTS THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN AGAIN SAT IN THEIR PRETTY GARDEN
HE COPIED ALL HER WAYS AND THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM HE WAS SOON ABLE TO IMITATE THE GAIT AND MANNER OF EVERYONE IN THE STREET EVERYTHING THAT WAS PECULIAR AND DISPLEASING IN THEM THAT KAY KNEW HOW TO IMITATE AND AT SUCH TIMES
HE PRONOUNCED IT SO AS TO RHYME WITH MAYOR I LOVE MY LOVE WITH AN H ALICE COULDN'T HELP BEGINNING BECAUSE HE IS HAPPY I HATE HIM WITH AN H BECAUSE HE IS HIDEOUS
THE OLD WOMAN HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE IT FROM HER HAT WHEN SHE MADE THE OTHERS VANISH IN THE EARTH BUT SO IT IS WHEN ONE'S THOUGHTS ARE NOT COLLECTED WHAT
THE LITTLE GIRL PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK HE WINKED HIS EYES NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN
THE KING WAS EVIDENTLY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AT HAVING TO SIT DOWN BETWEEN THE TWO GREAT CREATURES
OH THOSE WERE VERY LONG AND DISMAL WINTER EVENINGS AT LAST SPRING CAME WITH ITS WARM SUNSHINE KAY IS DEAD AND GONE SAID LITTLE GERDA THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SAID THE SUNSHINE
THEY WERE NOT BROTHER AND SISTER BUT THEY CARED FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS IF THEY WERE THEIR PARENTS LIVED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THEY INHABITED TWO GARRETS AND WHERE THE ROOF OF THE ONE HOUSE JOINED THAT OF THE OTHER
ONE TO FETCH AND ONE TO CARRY AT THIS MOMENT THE MESSENGER ARRIVED HE WAS FAR TOO MUCH OUT OF BREATH TO SAY A WORD
BUT THEY FELL CLOSE TO THE BANK AND THE LITTLE WAVES BORE THEM IMMEDIATELY TO LAND IT WAS AS IF THE STREAM WOULD NOT TAKE WHAT WAS DEAREST TO HER FOR IN REALITY IT HAD NOT GOT LITTLE KAY
SHE ROSE AND LOOKED FOR MANY HOURS AT THE BEAUTIFUL GREEN BANKS PRESENTLY SHE SAILED BY A LARGE CHERRY ORCHARD
SAID ALICE IT ISN'T RESPECTABLE TO BEG SAID THE KING I ONLY MEANT THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SAID ALICE
THE LION LOOKED AT ALICE WEARILY ARE YOU ANIMAL
AND SPREADING OUT BOTH HIS HANDS TOWARDS HER IN AN ANGLO SAXON ATTITUDE
BUT HE NO DOUBT WOULD COME AND SHE TOLD HER NOT TO BE CAST DOWN BUT TASTE HER CHERRIES AND LOOK AT HER FLOWERS WHICH WERE FINER THAN ANY IN A PICTURE BOOK EACH OF WHICH COULD TELL A WHOLE STORY SHE THEN TOOK GERDA BY THE HAND
ALICE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE BANK OF A LITTLE BROOK WITH THE GREAT DISH ON HER KNEES
THE MIRROR SHOOK SO TERRIBLY WITH GRINNING THAT IT FLEW OUT OF THEIR HANDS
IT WAS SO CAPITAL JUST AS THEY WERE IN THE VERY HEIGHT OF THEIR AMUSEMENT A LARGE SLEDGE PASSED BY
SAID THE GRANDMOTHER SHE FLIES WHERE THE SWARM HANGS IN THE THICKEST CLUSTERS SHE IS THE LARGEST OF ALL AND SHE CAN NEVER REMAIN QUIETLY ON THE EARTH BUT GOES UP AGAIN INTO THE BLACK CLOUDS
DOUBLE E AT THIS MOMENT THE UNICORN SAUNTERED BY THEM WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS I HAD THE BEST OF IT THIS TIME HE SAID TO THE KING JUST GLANCING AT HIM AS HE PASSED
HE REMARKED TO HER AS HE MUNCHED AWAY I SHOULD THINK THROWING COLD WATER OVER YOU WOULD BE BETTER ALICE SUGGESTED OR SOME SAL VOLATILE I DIDN'T SAY THERE WAS NOTHING BETTER THE KING REPLIED
SO SHE CLAMBERED INTO A BOAT WHICH LAY AMONG THE RUSHES WENT TO THE FARTHEST END AND THREW OUT THE SHOES BUT THE BOAT WAS NOT FASTENED AND THE MOTION WHICH SHE OCCASIONED MADE IT DRIFT FROM THE SHORE SHE OBSERVED THIS AND HASTENED TO GET BACK
BUT BEFORE ALICE COULD ANSWER HIM THE DRUMS BEGAN WHERE THE NOISE CAME FROM SHE COULDN'T MAKE OUT THE AIR SEEMED FULL OF IT AND IT RANG THROUGH AND THROUGH HER HEAD TILL SHE FELT QUITE DEAFENED
THAT HE KNEW THE NUMBER OF SQUARE MILES THERE WERE IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND HOW MANY INHABITANTS THEY CONTAINED AND SHE SMILED WHILE HE SPOKE IT THEN SEEMED TO HIM AS IF WHAT HE KNEW WAS NOT ENOUGH AND HE LOOKED UPWARDS
THE UNICORN WENT ON TURNING FROM HER TO THE KING NONE OF YOUR BROWN BREAD FOR ME CERTAINLY CERTAINLY THE KING MUTTERED AND BECKONED TO HAIGHA OPEN THE BAG HE WHISPERED QUICK NOT THAT ONE
SAID BOTH THE CHILDREN AND SO THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS TRUE CAN THE SNOW QUEEN COME IN
SAID KAY THAT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN REAL FLOWERS
AND OUT OF DOORS THERE WAS QUITE A SNOW STORM IT IS THE WHITE BEES THAT ARE SWARMING SAID KAY'S OLD GRANDMOTHER
DRESSED IN THE FINEST WHITE GAUZE MADE OF A MILLION LITTLE FLAKES LIKE STARS SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
CHAPTER SEVEN THE LION AND THE UNICORN THE NEXT MOMENT SOLDIERS CAME RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD AT FIRST IN TWOS AND THREES THEN TEN OR TWENTY TOGETHER AND AT LAST IN SUCH CROWDS
STILL SEEMED TO GERDA THAT ONE WAS WANTING THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHICH ONE DAY WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING AT THE HAT OF THE OLD WOMAN PAINTED WITH FLOWERS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEM ALL SEEMED TO HER TO BE A ROSE
KAY IS DEAD AND GONE
LED HER INTO THE LITTLE COTTAGE AND LOCKED THE DOOR THE WINDOWS WERE VERY HIGH UP THE GLASS WAS RED BLUE AND GREEN AND THE SUNLIGHT SHONE THROUGH QUITE WONDROUSLY IN ALL SORTS OF COLORS
MY SLEDGE DO NOT FORGET MY SLEDGE IT WAS THE FIRST THING HE THOUGHT OF IT WAS THERE TIED TO ONE OF THE WHITE CHICKENS WHO FLEW ALONG WITH IT ON HIS BACK BEHIND THE LARGE SLEDGE
AND CAUGHT THE SNOW AS IT FELL LOOK THROUGH THIS GLASS GERDA SAID HE AND EVERY FLAKE SEEMED LARGER AND APPEARED LIKE A MAGNIFICENT FLOWER OR BEAUTIFUL STAR IT WAS SPLENDID TO LOOK AT LOOK HOW CLEVER
KAY AND GERDA LOOKED AT THE PICTURE BOOK FULL OF BEASTS AND OF BIRDS AND IT WAS THEN THE CLOCK IN THE CHURCH TOWER WAS JUST STRIKING FIVE THAT KAY SAID OH
IS THAT A BARGAIN YES IF YOU LIKE SAID ALICE
AND NOW WE SHALL HEAR WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SECOND STORY A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL IN A LARGE TOWN WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY HOUSES AND SO MANY PEOPLE
SHE'S A DEAR GOOD CREATURE HE REPEATED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN MY LITTLE PLAYFELLOW
IF YOU WILL GIVE HIM BACK TO ME AND AS IT SEEMED TO HER
SHE WAS TALL AND OF SLENDER FIGURE
IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO DIE BUT A MOMENT MORE
THE WOLVES HOWLED THE SNOW CRACKLED ABOVE THEM FLEW LARGE SCREAMING CROWS BUT HIGHER UP APPEARED THE MOON QUITE LARGE AND BRIGHT
SAID THE ROSES WE HAVE BEEN IN THE EARTH WHERE ALL THE DEAD ARE BUT KAY WAS NOT THERE MANY THANKS SAID LITTLE GERDA AND SHE WENT TO THE OTHER FLOWERS LOOKED INTO THEIR CUPS AND ASKED
WHILE BY DAY HE SLEPT AT THE FEET OF THE SNOW QUEEN THIRD STORY OF THE FLOWER GARDEN AT THE OLD WOMAN'S WHO UNDERSTOOD WITCHCRAFT
AND AT THAT DISTANCE TOO WHY IT'S AS MUCH AS I CAN DO TO SEE REAL PEOPLE BY THIS LIGHT ALL THIS WAS LOST ON ALICE WHO WAS STILL LOOKING INTENTLY ALONG THE ROAD SHADING HER EYES WITH ONE HAND
IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE ENLIGHTENED COUNSELORS THE EXPERIENCE OF A DISCREET MATRON IS FREQUENTLY OF GREAT EFFICACY IN CHECKING THE PROGRESS OF DISEASE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MADAM IT IS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO CONTEND WITH IGNORANCE AND OBSTINACY
FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHEN HE MADE HIS MORNING ENTRANCE BUT AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT PRESIDED OVER THE COMFORTS OF THE ENGLISH COLONEL SARAH HAD SHRUNK WITH CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ENTERING THE ROOM YET SHE KNEW THE POSITION OF EVERY GLASS AND HAD WITH HER OWN HANDS SUPPLIED THE CONTENTS OF EVERY BOWL THAT STOOD ON HIS TABLE
WHAT SAID THE SURGEON INTERRUPTING HER DOES HE AFFECT TO DESPISE THE NEEDLE BUT IT IS MY LOT TO MEET WITH MEN DAILY WHO ARE EQUALLY PERVERSE AND WHO SHOW A STILL MORE CULPABLE DISRESPECT FOR THE INFORMATION THAT FLOWS FROM THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE
YES SAID THE OTHER SENDING THE SECOND SLIPPER AFTER THE FIRST AND THIS MAJOR DUNWOODIE NEVER OVERLOOKS AN ADVANTAGE I THINK IF WE HAD THE THING TO DO OVER AGAIN CONTINUED THE COLONEL RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS FEET WE MIGHT ALTER THE CASE VERY MATERIALLY THOUGH THE CHIEF THING THE REBELS HAVE NOW TO BOAST OF IS MY CAPTURE
THE FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE SPECTATORS AND THEY DISPERSED IN PURSUIT OF THEIR USUAL AVOCATIONS ISABELLA YIELDED TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF FRANCES WITHOUT RESISTANCE
AND FEARFUL THE CONVERSATION WOULD CEASE HE INQUIRED WITH AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT INTEREST YOU THINK IT WAS AGE AND DEBILITY THAT REMOVED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AT LAST AND THE TROUBLESOME TIMES TROUBLE IS A HEAVY PULL DOWN TO A SICK BED
HE DIED ABOUT TWO HOURS AND TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE COCK CROWED AS NEAR AS WE CAN SAY SHE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE PHYSICIAN WHO APPROACHING INQUIRED WITH MUCH INTEREST THE NATURE OF THE DISORDER GLANCING HER EYE OVER THE FIGURE OF THIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE KATY INSTINCTIVELY ADJUSTING HER DRESS
FRANCES WITHDREW TO SEEK HER AUNT MUSING DEEPLY ON THE CHARACTER AND EXTREME SENSIBILITY OF THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE CHANCE HAD BROUGHT TO THE COTTAGE THE WOUNDED OFFICER FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES AS SHE MOVED WITH INFANTILE GRACE THROUGH THE DOOR OF HIS APARTMENT AND AS SHE VANISHED FROM HIS VIEW HE OBSERVED
IMPELLED BY A CHARM THAT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL THE YOUTH HAD THROWN AN EARNEST LOOK AT FRANCES AS SOON AS HIS SISTER RAISED HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE LOVELY LINEAMENTS OF OUR HEROINE
BUT FREQUENTLY THROUGH A DREAD OF FUTURE DEPREDATIONS FROM THE COMMISERATION OF THEIR NEIGHBORS ALSO ADDITIONAL DUTIES HAD DRAWN THE LADIES FROM THEIR PILLOWS AT AN HOUR SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL AND CAPTAIN LAWTON
HE ANSWERED THE APPLICANT WITH A GOOD NATURED SMILE I JUDGE NOT IF DEATH HAS ANTICIPATED YOUR NUPTIALS I AM FEARFUL YOU HAVE NO REMEDY AGAINST HIS STERN DECREES TO KATY THIS SOUNDED WELL ALTHOUGH SHE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF ITS MEANING BUT DEATH AND NUPTIALS
THERE IS BUT LITTLE DANGER OF EXCEEDING THE TRUTH
THAT IS A QUESTION THE MAJOR CAN ANSWER BEST BUT YOU KNOW THE REDCOATS ARE ABROAD AND DUNWOODIE COMMANDS IN THE COUNTY THESE ENGLISH MUST BE LOOKED TO TRUE SAID SINGLETON SLOWLY AS IF STRUCK WITH THE OTHER'S REASONS BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE IDLE WHEN THERE IS WORK TO DO
AND HAVING GAINED THE ROOM WHERE THE LATTER CONDUCTED HER WEPT IN SILENCE ON THE SHOULDER OF THE OBSERVANT AND SOOTHING GIRL UNTIL FRANCES THOUGHT HER TEARS EXCEEDED THE EMOTION NATURAL TO THE OCCASION
WHO ADMINISTERED TO THE CASE NO ONE YET SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH QUICKNESS I EXPECT HE HAS MADE HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT THE SURGEON DISREGARDED THE SMILE OF THE LADIES AND PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES IT IS DOUBTLESS WISE TO BE PREPARED FOR DEATH BUT UNDER WHOSE CARE WAS THE SICK MAN DURING HIS INDISPOSITION
THE SURGEON DREW UP AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN WHISTLING A LOW AIR AS HE LOOKED OVER SOME PHIALS ON A TABLE BUT THE HOUSEKEEPER TURNING TO HIM WITH AN INCLINATION OF THE HEAD CONTINUED I SUPPOSE SIR A WOMAN HAS NO DOWER IN HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY UNLESS THEY BE ACTUALLY MARRIED
TRUE TRUE CRIED THE COLONEL WITH ANIMATION HAD I BEEN THERE TO HAVE IMPROVED THAT ADVANTAGE WE MIGHT HAVE TURNED THE TABLE ON THE YANKEES SAYING WHICH HE DISPLAYED STILL GREATER ANIMATION IN COMPLETING HIS TOILET AND HE WAS SOON PREPARED TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE FULLY RESTORED TO HIS OWN GOOD OPINION AND FAIRLY PERSUADED THAT HIS CAPTURE WAS OWING TO CASUALTIES ABSOLUTELY BEYOND THE CONTROL OF MAN
EVERYTHING IS AS YOU LEFT IT BUT IT GLIDED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH THE GRACE OF A FAIRY AND THE TENDERNESS OF AN ANGEL
AS HE INQUIRED WITH A BREVITY THAT WOULD HAVE HONORED LIEUTENANT MASON HAD IT PETTICOATS GEORGE I SAW NOTHING BUT ITS HEAVENLY EYES ITS BLOOM ITS MAJESTIC STEP ITS GRACE REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN WITH RATHER MORE ARDOR THAN HIS SURGEON THOUGHT CONSISTENT WITH HIS DEBILITATED CONDITION
TOLERATED THE INTERRUPTIONS WITH A VERY ILL GRACE AND ONCE FOR AN INSTANT HE VENTURED TO STEAL SOFTLY TO THE BED OF HIS OBSTINATE COMRADE AND WAS NEAR SUCCEEDING IN OBTAINING A TOUCH OF HIS PULSE WHEN A TERRIBLE OATH SWORN BY THE TROOPER IN A DREAM
AT LENGTH A SINGLE HORSE CHAISE WAS SEEN MAKING ITS WAY CAREFULLY AMONG THE STONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY AND APPROACHED THE COTTAGE
THE MAJOR CONSIDERATE DUNWOODIE MURMURED THE EXHAUSTED YOUTH SINKING AGAIN ON HIS PILLOW WHERE THE COMMANDS OF HIS ATTENDANT COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN SILENT EVEN CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN RECEIVED WITH MANY AND COURTEOUS INQUIRIES AFTER THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
NAY MY DEAR SITGREAVES SAID THE YOUTH TAKING HIS HAND YOU SEE THERE IS NO FEVER ABOUT ME LOOK IS THERE ANY OF JACK LAWTON'S HOARFROST ON MY TONGUE NO INDEED SAID THE SURGEON CLAPPING A SPOON IN THE MOUTH OF THE OTHER FORCING IT OPEN AND LOOKING DOWN HIS THROAT AS IF DISPOSED TO VISIT THE INTERIOR IN PERSON
HEM WITH SOMETHING OF THE KIND OF STEP YOU SPEAK OF A VERY COMPLACENT EYE AND AS TO THE BLOOM I DARE SAY OFFICES OF CHARITY CAN SUMMON AS FINE A COLOR TO HER CHEEKS AS GLOWS IN THE FACES OF HER MORE YOUTHFUL NIECES NIECES HAS SHE NIECES THEN
OH AUNT JEANETTE IS EXERTING HERSELF TO DO CREDIT TO MY FATHER'S HOSPITALITY SAID THE LAUGHING GIRL AND I AM A TRUANT FROM HER LABORS AS I SHALL BE A STRANGER TO HER FAVOR UNLESS I PROFFER MY ASSISTANCE
HIS CASE YOUNG LADY EXCEEDS MY ART TO HEAL AND I TAKE IT SIR HENRY CLINTON IS THE BEST ADVISER HE CAN APPLY TO THOUGH MAJOR DUNWOODIE HAS MADE THE COMMUNICATION WITH HIS LEECH RATHER DIFFICULT FRANCES SMILED BUT AVERTED HER FACE WHILE SARAH MOVED WITH THE GRACE OF AN OFFENDED JUNO FROM THE APARTMENT
AND THOSE HE HAS ON ARE NONE OF THE BEST I CAN TELL YOU HOW EXCLAIMED THE OTHER ASTONISHED COULD ANYONE HAVE THE HEART TO PLUNDER A MAN IN SUCH DISTRESS HEARTS REPEATED KATY CATCHING HER BREATH MEN LIKE THEM HAVE NO BOWELS AT ALL PLUNDER AND DISTRESS INDEED
BUT ISABELLA THE MEETING HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU YOU TREMBLE ISABELLA MADE NO REPLY SHE STRETCHED HER HAND TOWARDS THE TABLE WHICH HELD THE NOURISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTENTIVE FRANCES COMPREHENDED HER WISHES IN A MOMENT A GLASS OF WATER IN SOME MEASURE REVIVED THE SISTER WHO WAS ENABLED TO SAY
THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATED A MOMENT AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND ALL THAT THE SURGEON EXPRESSED YET SHE FELT IT WAS BOTH COMPLIMENTARY AND KIND THEREFORE SUPPRESSING HER NATURAL FLOW OF LANGUAGE A LITTLE SHE REPLIED
WHY GEORGE YOUR CASE IS BECOMING SINGULAR CONTINUED THE DOCTOR INSTINCTIVELY THROWING ASIDE HIS WIG YOUR PULSE EVEN AND SOFT YOUR SKIN MOIST BUT YOUR EYE FIERY AND CHEEK FLUSHED OH I MUST EXAMINE MORE CLOSELY INTO THESE SYMPTOMS
WE CAN DIE SECUNDEM ARTEM CRIED THE TROOPER TO THIS OBSERVATION THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT DEIGN TO REPLY BUT DEEMING IT NECESSARY TO HIS PROFESSIONAL DIGNITY THAT THE CONVERSATION SHOULD CONTINUE HE ADDED PERHAPS IN THIS INSTANCE JUDICIOUS TREATMENT MIGHT HAVE PROLONGED THE LIFE OF THE PATIENT
THE SOBS OF MISS SINGLETON FOR A TIME WERE VIOLENT AND UNCONTROLLABLE UNTIL WITH AN EVIDENT EXERTION SHE YIELDED TO A KIND OBSERVATION OF HER COMPANION AND SUCCEEDED IN SUPPRESSING HER TEARS RAISING HER FACE TO THE EYES OF FRANCES SHE ROSE
THAT SEEMED SO OVERWHELMING A NEARER VIEW OF THE DISTURBED FEATURES OF THE VISITOR CONFIRMED MISS PEYTON IN HER BELIEF AND WITH THE SHOCK THAT GENTLE FEELINGS EVER EXPERIENCE AT A SUDDEN AND ENDLESS SEPARATION FROM EVEN THE MEANEST OF THEIR ASSOCIATES SHE SAID HASTILY
HIS PATIENT SMILED AS HE GENTLY REPULSED HIS PHYSICIAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDO THE BANDAGES AND WITH A RETURNING GLOW TO HIS CHEEKS INQUIRED
AND AS SUCH WAS HIGHLY PLEASED WITH WHAT HE SAID
IT WAS THROWN OPEN BY A DRAGOON WHO FOLLOWED THE CARRIAGE AND WHO HAD BEEN THE MESSENGER DISPATCHED BY DUNWOODIE TO THE FATHER OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON MISS PEYTON ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR GUEST AND THE SISTERS UNITED IN GIVING HER THE KINDEST WELCOME
KATY IS HE GONE NO MA'AM REPLIED THE DISTURBED DAMSEL WITH GREAT BITTERNESS HE IS NOT YET GONE BUT HE MAY GO AS SOON AS HE PLEASES NOW FOR THE WORST IS DONE
BESIDES WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE DEERSKIN PURSE BUT HARVEY IS LITTLE BETTER NOW THAN A BEGGAR AND A BEGGAR MISS JEANETTE IS THE MOST AWFULLY DESPISABLE OF ALL EARTHLY CREATURES
HER EYES WERE UNIFORMLY FASTENED ON THE POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS SUDDENLY LOST BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HILL AND AT EACH TURN AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF THE SPOT SHE LINGERED UNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER SISTER QUICKENED HER PACE TO AN EVEN MOTION WITH THAT OF HER OWN
MISS PEYTON WAS LOOKING FROM A WINDOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TENEMENT OF THE PEDDLER AND WAS EXPRESSING A KIND ANXIETY AFTER THE WELFARE OF THE SICK MAN WHEN THE PERSON OF KATY SUDDENLY EMERGED FROM THE DENSE COVERING OF AN EARTHLY CLOUD WHOSE MISTS WERE SCATTERING BEFORE THE CHEERING RAYS OF THE SUN
THE TONGUE IS WELL AND THE PULSE BEGINS TO LOWER AGAIN AH THE BLEEDING DID YOU GOOD PHLEBOTOMY IS A SOVEREIGN SPECIFIC FOR SOUTHERN CONSTITUTIONS
STILL FRANCES COULD WITH DIFFICULTY WITHDRAW HER TRUANT EYES FROM THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR VISITOR SHE WAS YOUNG AND OF A LIGHT AND FRAGILE FORM BUT OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS HER EYES WERE LARGE FULL BLACK PIERCING AND AT TIMES A LITTLE WILD HER HAIR WAS LUXURIANT
THE COUNTENANCE OF KATY CHANGED FROM THE NATURAL EXPRESSION OF CONCERN TO THE SET FORM OF MELANCHOLY AS SHE ANSWERED HE IS HAPPILY REMOVED FROM THE CARES OF THE WORLD THE CHINKING OF THE MONEY MADE HIM GET OUT OF HIS BED AND THE POOR SOUL FOUND THE SHOCK TOO GREAT FOR HIM
FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
MY SWORD ARM IS NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION AND ROANOKE HAS BUT A SHAMBLING GAIT THIS MORNING BESIDES THERE IS ANOTHER REASON I COULD MENTION IF IT WERE NOT THAT MISS WHARTON WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME
A GOOD MOTHERLY LADY BUT AS TO LOVE THAT IS A MATTER OF TASTE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER WITH DEFERENCE TO HER PRUDENCE AND EXPERIENCE WOULD ACCORD BETTER WITH MY FANCY SHE MUST BE UNDER TWENTY SAID THE OTHER QUICKLY IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY YOU COUNT IF YOU BEGIN AT THE HEEL OF LIFE WELL
THE EYE OF THE SISTER WAS NOW BENT ON THE FACE OF THE TROOPER WHO MADE HIS SALUTATIONS TO THE LADY WITH EASE BLENDED WITH THE FRANKNESS OF A SOLDIER HIS MAN HAS BEEN HERE TWICE HE SAID TO INQUIRE HOW WE FARED IN THE LAZARETTO AND WHY NOT HIMSELF
THEREIN YOU SHOW YOUR SENSE SAID THE SURGEON APPROACHING THE SPINSTER WHO SAT HOLDING THE PALMS OF HER HANDS AND THE SOLES OF HER FEET TO THE GENIAL HEAT OF A FINE FIRE MAKING THE MOST OF COMFORT AMID ALL HER TROUBLES
AND BY HIS SYMPATHY SUCCEEDED IN RESTORING THE COLONEL TO HIS OWN GOOD GRACES
THE FAMILY AT THE LOCUSTS HAD SLEPT OR WATCHED THROUGH ALL THE DISTURBANCES AT THE COTTAGE OF BIRCH IN PERFECT IGNORANCE OF THEIR OCCURRENCE THE ATTACKS OF THE SKINNERS WERE ALWAYS MADE WITH SO MUCH PRIVACY AS TO EXCLUDE THE SUFFERERS
PIERCING EYES LOWERING AT HER THROUGH HIS THICK BROWS IN SILENCE PERHAPS THIS GENTLEMAN KNOWS HE SEEMS TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN MY STORY MADAM SAID THE TROOPER BOWING VERY LOW BOTH YOU AND THE TALE ARE EXTREMELY INTERESTING KATY SMILED INVOLUNTARILY
ON THE MARCH ISABELLA EAGERLY INQUIRED HER BROTHER NO DISMOUNTED AND SEEMINGLY AT REST WAS THE REPLY THE WONDERING DRAGOON TURNED HIS GAZE ON THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS SISTER WHO SAT WITH HER EYE BENT ON THE CARPET IN UNCONSCIOUS ABSENCE BUT FOUND NO EXPLANATION
CONSCIOUS INTEREST KEPT HER TONGUE TIED UNTIL HER SISTER WITH THE FRANKNESS OF INNOCENCE HAD PUT THE DESIRED QUESTION TO DOCTOR SITGREAVES COLONEL WELLMERE SAID THE OPERATOR GRAVELY IS IN WHAT I CALL A STATE OF FREE WILL MADAM HE IS ILL OR HE IS WELL AS HE PLEASES
AND DOCTOR SITGREAVES REMOVED ALL FURTHER APPREHENSIONS BY CONFIDENTLY PRONOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE A WELL MAN WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
AT THE TIME OF OUR TALE WE WERE A DIVIDED PEOPLE AND SARAH THOUGHT IT WAS NO MORE THAN HER DUTY TO CHERISH THE INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY TO WHICH SHE YET CLUNG AS THE LAND OF HER FOREFATHERS BUT THERE WERE OTHER AND MORE COGENT REASONS FOR THE SILENT PREFERENCE SHE WAS GIVING TO THE ENGLISHMAN
FRANCES FIXED HER LAUGHING EYES ON HER SISTER BUT FORBEARING TO SPEAK THE OTHER READILY CONSTRUED THEIR EXPRESSION AND HASTILY ADDED BUT I FORGET HE IS ONE OF YOUR RENOWNED CORPS OF VIRGINIANS AND MUST BE SPOKEN OF REVERENTLY AS RESPECTFULLY AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR SISTER
IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR A MAN TO GET A WIFE AT ALL IN SUCH A PREDICARY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD MISS PEYTON I SELDOM TROUBLE MYSELF WITH SUCH THINGS SAID THE LADY GRAVELY DURING THIS DIALOGUE CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN STUDYING THE COUNTENANCE AND MANNER OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH A MOST LUDICROUS GRAVITY
DOCTOR SITGREAVES DOES NOT MEAN A RIG'LAR SOLDIER BUT A REGULAR PHYSICIAN MADAM SAID THE TROOPER OH CRIED THE MAIDEN AGAIN CORRECTING HERSELF FOR THE BEST OF ALL REASONS THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD SO I TOOK CARE OF HIM MYSELF
HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
AND POSSIBLY DREAMING THAT THESE LITTLE FEMININE OFFICES WERE PERFORMED FOR ANOTHER HER NATURAL BLOOM WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE INSINUATION OF THE SURGEON NOR WAS THE LUSTER OF HER EYE IN ANY DEGREE DIMINISHED THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS OF SITGREAVES HASTENED HER RETREAT DOWN A PRIVATE STAIRWAY TO THE SIDE OF HER SISTER
HIS LOOK WAS CHANGED TO THE FACE OF FRANCES WHO STARTLED BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS EXPRESSION AROSE AND HASTILY INQUIRED IF HE WOULD HAVE ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU CAN PARDON THE RUDENESS SAID THE WOUNDED OFFICER MAKING A FEEBLE EFFORT TO RAISE HIS BODY I WOULD REQUEST TO HAVE CAPTAIN LAWTON'S COMPANY FOR A MOMENT
IT IS TRUE HE WANTED THE PERSONAL EXCELLENCE OF PEYTON DUNWOODIE BUT HIS PRETENSIONS WERE FAR FROM CONTEMPTIBLE SARAH HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE MORNING CASTING FREQUENT AND LONGING GLANCES AT THE DOOR OF WELLMERE'S APARTMENT ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE CONDITION OF HIS WOUNDS AND YET ASHAMED TO INQUIRE
INDEED I CAN EASILY COMPREHEND THE MORTIFICATION YOU MUST HAVE FELT IN HAVING ONE SO SELF WILLED TO DEAL WITH RETURNED THE SURGEON GLANCING HIS EYES REPROACHFULLY AT HIS COMRADE BUT YOU SHOULD RISE SUPERIOR TO SUCH OPINIONS AND PITY THE IGNORANCE BY WHICH THEY ARE ENGENDERED
WHY RETURNED THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATING A LITTLE I THOUGHT WE WERE AS GOOD AS SO I WONDER IF I HAVE NO CLAIM ON THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOW IT IS HARVEY'S IT WILL SURELY BE CONFISCATED TURNING TO LAWTON WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN ONE POSTURE WITH HIS
MORE COMPOSED THAN HER PREVIOUS AGITATION HAD GIVEN REASON TO EXPECT ISABELLA FOUND HER BROTHER LOOKING BETTER AND IN LESS DANGER THAN HER SENSITIVE IMAGINATION HAD LED HER TO SUPPOSE HER SPIRITS ROSE IN PROPORTION FROM DESPONDENCY SHE PASSED TO SOMETHING LIKE GAYETY
THE COLOR OF FRANCES CHANGED AS THE VEHICLE GRADUALLY DREW NEARER AND WHEN SHE WAS ENABLED TO SEE A FEMALE FORM IN IT BY THE SIDE OF A BLACK IN LIVERY HER LIMBS SHOOK WITH AN AGITATION THAT COMPELLED HER TO LEAN ON SARAH FOR SUPPORT IN A FEW MINUTES THE TRAVELERS APPROACHED THE GATE
IN SHORT WHARTON SAID THE COLONEL PUTTING ONE LEG OUT OF BED IT MAY BE CALLED A COMBINATION OF UNTOWARD EVENTS YOUR OWN UNGOVERNABLE HORSE PREVENTED MY ORDERS FROM BEING CARRIED TO THE MAJOR IN SEASON TO FLANK THE REBELS VERY TRUE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN KICKING A SLIPPER TOWARDS THE BED
BUT MY HUMBLE KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO THE SETTING OF A SQUADRON IN THE FIELD AND USING IT WHEN THERE I BEG LEAVE TO REFER YOU TO DOCTOR ARCHIBALD SITGREAVES A GENTLEMAN OF UNIVERSAL ATTAINMENTS AND UNBOUNDED PHILANTHROPY THE VERY MILK OF HUMAN SYMPATHIES AND A MORTAL FOE TO ALL INDISCRIMINATE CUTTING
HE HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN BRINGING ME A NURSE WHOSE PRESENCE ALONE IS ABLE TO RAISE ME FROM MY COUCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE LADY'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED
THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
HER OWN ROOM HOWEVER AFFORDED HER BUT LITTLE RELIEF AND IN PASSING THROUGH THE LONG GALLERY THAT COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE BUILDING SHE NOTICED THE DOOR OF SINGLETON'S ROOM TO BE OPEN THE WOUNDED YOUTH SEEMED SLEEPING AND WAS ALONE
AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT THE POWDER IT WAS THEN THE FASHION TO WEAR IT FELL IN RAVEN BLACKNESS A FEW OF ITS LOCKS HAD FALLEN ON HER CHEEK GIVING ITS CHILLING WHITENESS BY THE CONTRAST A MORE DEADLY CHARACTER
NOTWITHSTANDING THE SUFFERINGS OF HIS BODY HAD RISEN IN COMPLIANCE WITH A RULE FROM WHICH HE NEVER DEPARTED OF SLEEPING BUT SIX HOURS AT A TIME THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEW POINTS IN WHICH THE CARE OF THE HUMAN FRAME WAS INVOLVED ON WHICH THE TROOPER AND THE SURGEON OF HORSE WERE EVER KNOWN TO AGREE
I'M SURE HARVEY HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY FROM HAVING SO MUCH CONCERNS WITH THE RIG'LARS REPLIED THE HOUSEKEEPER HE HAS LOST HIS ALL AND MADE HIMSELF A VAGABOND THROUGH THE LAND AND I HAVE REASON TO RUE THE DAY I EVER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
AND THE LATTER ADVANCED PROMPTLY AND LAID HIS FINGERS ON THE PULSE OF THE YOUTH BECKONING TO HIM TO BE SILENT WHILE HE MUTTERED GROWING SYMPTOMS OF A FEBRILE PULSE NO NO MY DEAR GEORGE YOU MUST REMAIN QUIET AND DUMB THOUGH YOUR EYES LOOK BETTER AND YOUR SKIN HAS EVEN A MOISTURE
THEY WERE REPULSED YOU SAW IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO DRIVE US FROM THE WOOD AT LEAST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY MADE AN ATTACK SAID THE CAPTAIN THROWING THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES WITHIN REACH OF THE COLONEL
UNDER MINE ANSWERED KATY WITH AN AIR OF A LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND CARE THROWN AWAY I MAY WELL CALL IT FOR HARVEY IS QUITE TOO DESPISABLE TO BE ANY SORT OF COMPENSATION AT PRESENT THE MUTUAL IGNORANCE OF EACH OTHER'S MEANING MADE VERY LITTLE INTERRUPTION TO THE DIALOGUE
IT WAS A MAXIM WITH DOCTOR SITGREAVES THAT NO SPECIES OF KNOWLEDGE WAS TO BE DESPISED AND CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS AN EMPIRIC IN EVERYTHING BUT HIS PROFESSION AT FIRST INDIGNATION AT THE IRONY OF HIS COMRADE KEPT HIM SILENT BUT SUDDENLY CHANGING HIS PURPOSE
BUT I THINK MISTER DUNWOODIE HAS TAKEN A LIBERTY THAT EXCEEDS THE RIGHTS OF CONSANGUINITY HE HAS MADE OUR FATHER'S HOUSE A HOSPITAL WE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT NONE OF THE PATIENTS IT CONTAINS ARE DEARER TO US YOUR BROTHER IS ONE TRUE TRUE INTERRUPTED FRANCES BLUSHING TO THE EYES
STARTLED THE PRUDENT SURGEON AND WARNED HIM OF A TRITE SAYING IN THE CORPS THAT CAPTAIN LAWTON ALWAYS SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN THIS GROUP HAD ASSEMBLED IN ONE OF THE PARLORS AS THE SUN MADE ITS APPEARANCE OVER THE EASTERN HILL DISPERSING THE COLUMNS OF FOG WHICH HAD ENVELOPED THE LOWLAND
I DOCTORED HIM MOSTLY WITH YARBS SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER SMILING AS IF CONSCIOUS OF ERROR WITH SIMPLES RETURNED THE SURGEON THEY ARE SAFER IN THE HANDS OF THE UNLETTERED THAN MORE POWERFUL REMEDIES BUT WHY HAD YOU NO REGULAR ATTENDANT
FRANCES HAD STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE ACTION AND FACE OF ISABELLA WITH A KIND OF UNEASY ADMIRATION BUT SHE NOW SPRANG TO HER SIDE WITH THE ARDOR OF A SISTER AND KINDLY DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HER OWN LED THE WAY TO A RETIRED ROOM
DOUBTLESS IT IS HIS DUTY TWAS SAID ABOVE A ROYAL PARTY WAS MOVING ON THE RIVER THOUGH I PASSED THE TROOPS BUT TWO MILES FROM THIS SPOT THE LATTER PART OF THE SENTENCE WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE AND IT WAS SPOKEN MORE IN THE MANNER OF A SOLILOQUY THAN AS IF FOR THE EARS OF HER COMPANIONS
TO THIS PART OF HIS SPEECH THEN SHE DIRECTED HER REPLY I DID THINK HE ONLY WAITED THE DEATH OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN BEFORE HE MARRIED SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER LOOKING ON THE CARPET BUT NOW HE IS NOTHING MORE THAN DESPISABLE OR WHAT'S THE SAME THING A PEDDLER WITHOUT HOUSE PACK OR MONEY
I TELL HARVEY HIS CONDUCT IS OFTEN CONDEMNABLE AND LAST NIGHT HE MADE MY WORDS GOOD BUT THE OPINIONS OF SUCH UNBELIEVERS IS NOT VERY CONSEQUENTIAL YET IT IS DREADFUL TO THINK HOW HE BEHAVES AT TIMES NOW WHEN HE THREW AWAY THE NEEDLE
WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
A BROTHER WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND PERHAPS A VICTIM YOUR FATHER DISTRESSED HIS PRIVACY INTERRUPTED AND NOT IMPROBABLY HIS ESTATES TORN FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS KING FRANCES CONTINUED HER WALK IN SILENCE WHILE FACING THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE VALE
TO HIS GREAT JOY HIS MAN PRONOUNCED THE STEED TO BE EQUALLY CONVALESCENT WITH THE MASTER AND LAWTON FOUND THAT BY DINT OF RUBBING THE ANIMAL'S LIMBS SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT CEASING HE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE HIS FEET IN WHAT HE CALLED SYSTEMATIC MOTION
THE ANGEL I SAW MAY BE A DAUGHTER A SISTER OR A NIECE BUT NEVER AN AUNT HUSH GEORGE HUSH YOUR TALKING HAS BROUGHT YOUR PULSE UP AGAIN YOU MUST OBSERVE QUIET AND PREPARE FOR A MEETING WITH YOUR OWN SISTER WHO WILL BE HERE WITHIN AN HOUR WHAT ISABELLA AND WHO SENT FOR HER
IT IS PRESUMPTUOUS IN YOU TO PRETEND TO TELL YOUR MEDICAL ATTENDANT WHEN YOU ARE FREE FROM PAIN IF IT BE NOT TO ENABLE US TO DECIDE IN SUCH MATTERS OF WHAT AVAIL THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE FOR SHAME GEORGE FOR SHAME EVEN THAT PERVERSE FELLOW JOHN LAWTON COULD NOT BEHAVE WITH MORE OBSTINACY
THE SISTERS THEN SOUGHT THE FRESH AIR ON THE PIAZZA AND AS THEY PURSUED THEIR WALK ARM IN ARM THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE TOOK PLACE THERE IS SOMETHING DISAGREEABLE ABOUT THIS SURGEON OF DUNWOODIE SAID SARAH THAT CAUSES ME TO WISH HIM AWAY MOST HEARTILY
YOU APPEAR TO BE A SENSIBLE DISCREET WOMAN AND SOME WHO HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF ACQUIRING MORE CORRECT VIEWS MIGHT ENVY YOU YOUR RESPECT FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE ALTHOUGH THE HOUSEKEEPER DID NOT ALTOGETHER COMPREHEND THE OTHER'S MEANING SHE KNEW HE USED A COMPLIMENT
SPEAK I BEG WITHOUT DREAD OF MY DISPLEASURE SAID FRANCES RETURNING THE GOOD HUMORED SMILE OF THE TROOPER WITH THE ARCHNESS NATURAL TO HER OWN SWEET FACE THE ODORS OF YOUR KITCHEN THEN CRIED LAWTON BLUNTLY FORBID MY QUITTING THE DOMAINS UNTIL I QUALIFY MYSELF TO SPEAK WITH MORE CERTAINTY CONCERNING THE FATNESS OF THE LAND
BUT I SUPPOSE HIS TIME HAD COME AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT MATTERS BUT LITTLE WHAT DOCTOR'S STUFF WE TAKE LET ME SET YOU RIGHT IN THAT PARTICULAR INTERRUPTED THE SURGEON WE MUST ALL DIE IT IS TRUE BUT IT IS PERMITTED US TO USE THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE IN ARRESTING DANGERS AS THEY OCCUR UNTIL
BUT IF YOU RECKON DOWNWARD AS IS MOST COMMON I THINK SHE IS NEARER FORTY YOU HAVE MISTAKEN AN ELDER SISTER FOR THE AUNT SAID ISABELLA LAYING HER FAIR HAND ON THE MOUTH OF THE INVALID YOU MUST BE SILENT YOUR FEELINGS ARE BEGINNING TO AFFECT YOUR FRAME
IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF ME THAT I WANTED NOTHING BUT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE QUITE A PHYSICIAN MYSELF SO LONG AS BEFORE I CAME TO LIVE WITH HARVEY'S FATHER THEY CALLED ME THE PETTICOAT DOCTOR MORE TRUE THAN CIVIL I DARE SAY RETURNED THE SURGEON LOSING SIGHT OF THE WOMAN'S CHARACTER IN HIS ADMIRATION OF HER RESPECT FOR THE HEALING ART
AND WAS SEEN MAKING HASTY STEPS TOWARDS THE LOCUSTS THERE WAS THAT IN THE AIR OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WHICH BESPOKE DISTRESS OF AN UNUSUAL NATURE AND THE KIND HEARTED MISTRESS OF THE LOCUSTS OPENED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH THE BENEVOLENT INTENTION OF SOOTHING A GRIEF
ORDERS WERE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN TO BE IN READINESS TO REJOIN THE TROOP AT THE FOUR CORNERS AS SOON AS HIS MASTER HAD SHARED IN THE BOUNTY OF THE APPROACHING BANQUET
DOCTOR SITGREAVES SUPPORTED HER FROM THE CHAISE AND WHEN SHE GAINED THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA SHE TURNED AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PRACTITIONER YOUR BROTHER IS OUT OF DANGER AND WISHES TO SEE YOU MISS SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON THE LADY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS OWN ROOM AND NOTWITHSTANDING CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SMILES OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE
BUT HE LEAVES HIS ROOM AND THINKS HIS WOUND LIGHTLY PURCHASED BY THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS IF SHE ADDED WITH A TREMULOUS LIP THIS DREADFUL SUSPICION THAT IS AFFIXED TO HIS VISIT WERE REMOVED I COULD CONSIDER HIS WOUND OF LITTLE MOMENT YOU NOW HAVE THE FRUITS OF REBELLION BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
GOD WILL REWARD YOU FOR ALL THE GOOD YOU HAVE DONE SAID MISS PEYTON MILDLY YES INTERRUPTED THE SPINSTER HASTILY AND WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE THAT WAS INSTANTLY SUCCEEDED BY AN EXPRESSION THAT DENOTED MORE OF WORLDLY CARE
REPLIED TWAS THE TROUBLES OF THE TIMES AND THE LOSS OF PROPERTY THAT BROUGHT HIM DOWN HE WASTED FROM DAY TO DAY AND ALL MY CARE AND ANXIETY WERE LOST FOR NOW HARVEY IS NO BETTER THAN A BEGGAR AND WHO IS THERE TO PAY ME FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE
SOFTLY MY GOOD FRIEND SOFTLY SAID THE YOUTH FALLING BACK ON HIS PILLOW AND LOSING SOME OF THAT COLOR WHICH ALARMED HIS COMPANION I BELIEVE IN EXTRACTING THE BALL YOU DID FOR ME ALL THAT IS REQUIRED I AM FREE FROM PAIN AND ONLY WEAK I DO ASSURE YOU CAPTAIN SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON WITH HEAT
THE MORNING FOUND THEM ALL RESTORED IN SOME MEASURE TO THEIR FORMER EASE OF BODY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS WHO HAD BEEN SO DEEPLY REGRETTED BY DUNWOODIE THE WOUND OF THIS OFFICER WAS SEVERE THOUGH THE SURGEON PERSEVERED IN SAYING THAT IT WAS WITHOUT DANGER
BUT THEN I HAVE LEFT MY WAGES FOR THREE YEARS PAST IN THE HANDS OF HARVEY AND HOW AM I TO GET THEM MY BROTHERS TOLD ME AGAIN AND AGAIN TO ASK FOR MY MONEY BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT ACCOUNTS BETWEEN RELATIONS WERE EASILY SETTLED WERE YOU RELATED THEN TO BIRCH ASKED MISS PEYTON OBSERVING HER TO PAUSE
WHARTON KNEW THAT THEIR MISFORTUNE AS THEY BOTH TERMED THEIR DEFEAT WAS OWING TO THE OTHER'S RASHNESS BUT HE FORBORE TO SPEAK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT WHICH HAD DEPRIVED THE ENGLISH OF THEIR LEADER AND TO WHICH HE GOOD NATUREDLY ASCRIBED THEIR SUBSEQUENT DISCOMFITURE
HER BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED WITH RENOVATED BRILLIANCY AND HER FACE WAS LIGHTED WITH SMILES SO FASCINATING THAT FRANCES WHO IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER EARNEST ENTREATIES HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE SICK CHAMBER SAT GAZING ON A COUNTENANCE THAT POSSESSED SO WONDERFUL VARIABILITY
HARVEY IS AS OBSTINATE ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS A DUMB BEAST ONE WOULD THINK THE CARE I TOOK OF HIS BEDRIDDEN FATHER MIGHT LEARN HIM BETTER THAN TO DESPISE GOOD NURSING BUT SOME DAY HE MAY KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANT A CAREFUL WOMAN IN HIS HOUSE THOUGH NOW I AM SURE HE IS TOO DESPISABLE HIMSELF TO HAVE A HOUSE
WHY MA'AM THERE WERE IN THE IRON POT IN PLAIN SIGHT FIFTY FOUR GUINEAS OF GOLD BESIDES WHAT LAY UNDERNEATH WHICH I COULDN'T COUNT WITHOUT HANDLING AND I DIDN'T LIKE TO TOUCH IT FOR THEY SAY THAT ANOTHER'S GOLD IS APT TO STICK SO JUDGING FROM THAT IN SIGHT THERE WASN'T LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
THE DOCTOR HAD WATCHED DURING THE NIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE BED OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE WOUNDED ENGLISHMAN WHO BEING MORE HURT IN THE SPIRIT THAN IN THE FLESH
FOR MY PART I AM CLEAR FOR DOCTORING THOUGH HARVEY SAYS I AM KILLING MYSELF WITH MEDICINES
IF ANYONE INTERFERES WITH MY PATIENTS CRIED THE DOCTOR HASTILY I WILL TEACH THEM SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT WHAT IT IS TO MEDDLE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CONCERNS TUT MY DEAR FELLOW THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE MADE NOR ANY INTENDED SEE EXHIBITING THE BANDAGES
HUMMING A LITTLE SONG I LISTENED TO MY RIDER'S FOOTSTEPS UNTIL THEY REACHED THE HOUSE AND HEARD HIM KNOCK AT THE DOOR THERE WAS A MEADOW ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE GATE OF WHICH STOOD OPEN
AND WHEN THE KING ASKED HIM WHERE DO MY TWELVE DAUGHTERS DANCE AT NIGHT HE ANSWERED WITH TWELVE PRINCES IN A CASTLE UNDER GROUND AND THEN HE TOLD THE KING ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHOWED HIM THE THREE BRANCHES AND THE GOLDEN CUP
AND JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE FLYING FIGURE NOW FAR AWAY ON THE ROAD IN AN INSTANT HE SPRANG TO THE SADDLE I NEEDED NO WHIP NO SPUR FOR I WAS AS EAGER AS MY RIDER
THOUGH THE MAN WHO HAD ME SWORE IT WAS ONLY A SLIP IN THE STALL THE FIRST THING WAS TO PULL MY MOUTH OPEN
JUST AS WE WERE MOVING OFF A FOOTMAN CAME OUT WITH A SLIP OF PAPER
THEY CONFESSED IT ALL AND THE KING ASKED THE SOLDIER
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW MANY KINGS SONS HAVE ALREADY WATCHED IN VAIN AND AS FOR THIS SOLDIER EVEN IF I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM HIS SLEEPING DRAUGHT
AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL MASH READY FOR ME SAUSAGE DUMPLING AND APPLE TURNOVER SHOUTED THE BOY WHICH SET THEM ALL LAUGHING I WAS LED INTO A COMFORTABLE CLEAN SMELLING STALL WITH PLENTY OF DRY STRAW
SO THEY WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO A GREAT LAKE AND AT THE SIDE OF THE LAKE THERE LAY TWELVE LITTLE BOATS WITH TWELVE HANDSOME PRINCES IN THEM WHO SEEMED TO BE WAITING THERE FOR THE PRINCESSES ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WENT INTO EACH BOAT
I FOUND BY THEIR CONVERSATION THAT MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS NOW OUT OF DANGER AND WOULD SOON BE ABLE TO RIDE AGAIN
I HARDLY KNOW WHERE I AM GOING OR WHAT I HAD BETTER DO SAID THE SOLDIER BUT I THINK I SHOULD LIKE VERY WELL TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCE AND THEN IN TIME I MIGHT BE A KING WELL SAID THE OLD DAME
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE STAIRS THE SOLDIER RAN ON BEFORE THE PRINCESSES AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND AS THE TWELVE SISTERS SLOWLY CAME UP VERY MUCH TIRED THEY HEARD HIM SNORING IN HIS BED SO THEY SAID
I AM NOT VERY YOUNG SO I WILL HAVE THE ELDEST AND THEY WERE MARRIED THAT VERY DAY
AS SOON AS YOU PUT THAT ON YOU WILL BECOME INVISIBLE AND YOU WILL THEN BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE PRINCESSES WHEREVER THEY GO
AND THE HEAD GROOM WAS LEFT IN CHARGE THE LADY HARRIET WHO REMAINED AT THE HALL WAS A GREAT INVALID AND NEVER WENT OUT IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE LADY ANNE PREFERRED RIDING ON HORSEBACK WITH HER BROTHER OR COUSINS
TO THE COMMON TO THE COMMON SIR SHE HAS TURNED OFF THERE I KNEW THIS COMMON VERY WELL IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART VERY UNEVEN GROUND COVERED WITH HEATHER AND DARK GREEN FURZE BUSHES
AND I WILL TRY YOUR CHARMING LIZZIE YOU MUST CONFESS THAT IN SIZE AND APPEARANCE
AND THE SOLDIER BROKE A BRANCH FROM EACH AND EVERY TIME THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE WHICH MADE THE YOUNGEST SISTER TREMBLE WITH FEAR BUT THE ELDEST STILL SAID IT WAS ONLY THE PRINCES WHO WERE CRYING FOR JOY
HE DETERMINED TO TRY HIS LUCK SO HE WENT TO THE KING AND SAID HE WAS WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK HE WAS AS WELL RECEIVED AS THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AND THE KING ORDERED FINE ROYAL ROBES TO BE GIVEN HIM
ORDERED HIS HEAD TO BE CUT OFF AFTER HIM CAME SEVERAL OTHERS
AS THEY WERE TROTTED OUT WITH A LEADING REIN THE GROOM RUNNING BY THE SIDE BUT ROUND IN THE BACKGROUND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF POOR THINGS SADLY BROKEN DOWN WITH HARD WORK WITH THEIR KNEES KNUCKLING OVER
THEN FEEL ALL THE WAY DOWN MY LEGS AND GIVE ME A HARD FEEL OF THE SKIN AND FLESH AND THEN TRY MY PACES IT WAS WONDERFUL WHAT A DIFFERENCE THERE WAS IN THE WAY THESE THINGS WERE DONE SOME DID IT IN A ROUGH OFFHAND WAY AS IF
SHE WAS A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN AND AS GAY AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL SHE CHOSE ME FOR HER HORSE AND NAMED ME BLACK AUSTER I ENJOYED THESE RIDES VERY MUCH IN THE CLEAR COLD AIR
WHILE OTHERS WOULD TAKE THEIR HANDS GENTLY OVER ONE'S BODY WITH A PAT NOW AND THEN AS MUCH AS TO SAY BY YOUR LEAVE OF COURSE I JUDGED A GOOD DEAL OF THE BUYERS BY THEIR MANNERS TO MYSELF
THE LADY ANNE OR A RUNAWAY HORSE EARLY IN THE SPRING LORD W AND PART OF HIS FAMILY WENT UP TO LONDON AND TOOK YORK WITH THEM
AND LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD WE DASHED AFTER THEM FOR ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF THE ROAD RAN STRAIGHT AND THEN BENT TO THE RIGHT AFTER WHICH IT DIVIDED INTO TWO ROADS
YOU SILLY CREATURE SAID THE ELDEST IT IS NOTHING BUT A NAIL IN THE WALL THEN DOWN THEY ALL WENT AND AT THE BOTTOM THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MOST DELIGHTFUL GROVE OF TREES AND THE LEAVES WERE ALL OF SILVER
WHEN LORD GEORGE TOOK GINGER FOR HUNTING YORK SHOOK HIS HEAD HE SAID IT OUGHT TO BE A STEADY HAND TO TRAIN A HORSE FOR THE FIRST SEASON AND NOT A RANDOM RIDER LIKE LORD GEORGE GINGER USED TO LIKE IT VERY MUCH
THERE WAS NO SOUND GENTLY HE TURNED HER FACE UPWARD IT WAS GHASTLY WHITE AND THE EYES WERE CLOSED ANNIE DEAR ANNIE DO SPEAK BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER HE UNBUTTONED HER HABIT
THAT IF ANY PERSON COULD DISCOVER THE SECRET AND FIND OUT WHERE IT WAS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCED IN THE NIGHT HE SHOULD HAVE THE ONE HE LIKED BEST FOR HIS WIFE AND SHOULD BE KING AFTER HIS DEATH
THERE THEY ALL LANDED AND WENT INTO THE CASTLE AND EACH PRINCE DANCED WITH HIS PRINCESS AND THE SOLDIER WHO WAS ALL THE TIME INVISIBLE DANCED WITH THEM TOO AND WHEN ANY OF THE PRINCESSES HAD A CUP OF WINE SET BY HER HE DRANK IT ALL UP
HIS SHOVEL DROPPED AND HIS HANDS RAISED AS WE CAME NEAR HE MADE A SIGN TO SPEAK
THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES THERE WAS A KING WHO HAD TWELVE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS THEY SLEPT IN TWELVE BEDS ALL IN ONE ROOM AND WHEN THEY WENT TO BED THE DOORS WERE SHUT
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN SHE CAME BACK I COULD SEE THAT SHE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH STRAINED AND NOW AND THEN SHE GAVE A SHORT COUGH SHE HAD TOO MUCH SPIRIT TO COMPLAIN BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE COACH HOUSES AND STABLES ON THE OTHER MY OWNER PULLED UP AT ONE OF THE HOUSES AND WHISTLED THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE GIRL AND BOY RAN OUT
TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT BLANTYRE PAID ME A VISIT HE PATTED ME AND PRAISED ME VERY MUCH HE TOLD LORD GEORGE THAT HE WAS SURE THE HORSE KNEW OF ANNIE'S DANGER AS WELL AS HE DID
AND IF A HORSE MAY SPEAK HIS MIND SO FAR AS HE UNDERSTANDS I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE MORE LIES TOLD AND MORE TRICKERY AT THAT HORSE FAIR
NOW ALL IS QUITE SAFE THEN THEY UNDRESSED THEMSELVES PUT AWAY THEIR FINE CLOTHES PULLED OFF THEIR SHOES AND WENT TO BED IN THE MORNING THE SOLDIER SAID NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
JUST THEN SOME CART HORSES AND SEVERAL YOUNG COLTS CAME TROTTING OUT IN A VERY DISORDERLY MANNER WHILE A BOY BEHIND WAS CRACKING A GREAT WHIP THE COLTS WERE WILD AND FROLICSOME
AS IF HE WAS FAST ASLEEP WHEN THE TWELVE PRINCESSES HEARD THIS THEY LAUGHED HEARTILY AND THE ELDEST SAID THIS FELLOW TOO MIGHT HAVE DONE A WISER THING THAN LOSE HIS LIFE IN THIS WAY
THROUGH SOME ACCIDENT OR BLEMISH UNSOUNDNESS OF WIND OR SOME OTHER COMPLAINT THERE WERE SOME SPLENDID ANIMALS QUITE IN THEIR PRIME AND FIT FOR ANYTHING THEY WERE THROWING OUT THEIR LEGS AND SHOWING OFF THEIR PACES IN HIGH STYLE
NOW IT CHANCED THAT AN OLD SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN WOUNDED IN BATTLE AND COULD FIGHT NO LONGER PASSED THROUGH THE COUNTRY WHERE THIS KING REIGNED AND AS HE WAS TRAVELLING THROUGH A WOOD HE MET AN OLD WOMAN WHO ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING
MAY OPEN HER EYES SOON THEN SEEING THE OTHER MAN HE CALLED OUT HERE JOE RUN FOR SOME WATER AND TELL MY MISSIS
AND A GOOD MANY LIKE MYSELF HANDSOME AND HIGH BRED
NO NO HE SAID I'LL BE BACK TO EM AGAIN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE FIELDS
THEN THEY ROSE UP AND OPENED THEIR DRAWERS AND BOXES AND TOOK OUT ALL THEIR FINE CLOTHES AND DRESSED THEMSELVES AT THE GLASS
AND WITH ONE DETERMINED LEAP CLEARED BOTH DIKE AND BANK MOTIONLESS AMONG THE HEATHER WITH HER FACE TO THE EARTH
THERE HAD BEEN A WIDE DIKE RECENTLY CUT AND THE EARTH FROM THE CUTTING WAS CAST UP ROUGHLY ON THE OTHER SIDE SURELY THIS WOULD STOP THEM BUT NO WITH SCARCELY A PAUSE LIZZIE TOOK THE LEAP
TILL IN THE TWILIGHT WE REACHED THE GREAT CITY THE GAS LAMPS WERE ALREADY LIGHTED THERE WERE STREETS TO THE RIGHT AND STREETS TO THE LEFT AND STREETS CROSSING EACH OTHER FOR MILE UPON MILE I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER COME TO THE END OF THEM
ONLY TAKE CARE NOT TO DRINK ANY OF THE WINE WHICH ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WILL BRING TO YOU IN THE EVENING AND AS SOON AS SHE LEAVES YOU PRETEND TO BE FAST ASLEEP THEN SHE GAVE HIM A CLOAK AND SAID
WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN THE KING CALLED FOR THE PRINCESSES AND ASKED THEM WHETHER WHAT THE SOLDIER SAID WAS TRUE AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY WERE DISCOVERED
AND WHEN THE EVENING CAME HE WAS LED TO THE OUTER CHAMBER JUST AS HE WAS GOING TO LIE DOWN THE ELDEST OF THE PRINCESSES BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF WINE BUT THE SOLDIER THREW IT ALL AWAY SECRETLY TAKING CARE NOT TO DRINK A DROP
SOMETIMES WITH GINGER SOMETIMES WITH LIZZIE THIS LIZZIE WAS A BRIGHT BAY MARE ALMOST THOROUGHBRED AND A GREAT FAVORITE WITH THE GENTLEMEN ON ACCOUNT OF HER FINE ACTION AND LIVELY SPIRIT
SO PLEASE HELP ME TO MOUNT LIKE A GOOD FRIEND AS YOU ARE THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE SAID HE PLACED HER CAREFULLY ON THE SADDLE LOOKED TO THE BIT AND CURB GAVE THE REINS GENTLY INTO HER HAND AND THEN MOUNTED ME
WOULD THEY ASK THIS QUESTION FOR HER AT DOCTOR ASHLEY'S AND BRING THE ANSWER THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT A MILE OFF AND THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE WAS THE LAST IN IT WE WENT ALONG GAYLY ENOUGH
AND THERE WERE SOME VERY DEJECTED LOOKING OLD HORSES WITH THE UNDER LIP HANGING DOWN AND THE EARS LYING BACK HEAVILY AS IF THERE WERE NO MORE PLEASURE IN LIFE AND NO MORE HOPE THERE WERE SOME SO THIN YOU MIGHT SEE ALL THEIR RIBS
SCARCELY DRAWING THE REIN BLANTYRE SHOUTED WHICH WAY TO THE RIGHT CRIED THE WOMAN POINTING WITH HER HAND AND AWAY WE WENT UP THE RIGHT HAND ROAD THEN FOR A MOMENT WE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER
AT ONCE THE LITTLE HAND WAS PATTING ABOUT ALL OVER MY SHOULDER WITHOUT FEAR HOW GOOD IT FELT LET ME GET HIM A BRAN MASH WHILE YOU RUB HIM DOWN SAID THE MOTHER DO POLLY IT'S JUST WHAT HE WANTS
AND SOME WITH OLD SORES ON THEIR BACKS AND HIPS THESE WERE SAD SIGHTS FOR A HORSE TO LOOK UPON WHO KNOWS NOT BUT HE MAY COME TO THE SAME STATE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF BARGAINING OF RUNNING UP AND BEATING DOWN
AND SHE CRIED OUT TO HER SISTERS ALL IS NOT RIGHT
WITH LADY ANNE'S MAID AND HELP I SHALL STAY HERE ALL RIGHT SIR
AND THE SOLDIER STEPPED INTO THE SAME BOAT WITH THE YOUNGEST AS THEY WERE ROWING OVER THE LAKE THE PRINCE WHO WAS IN THE BOAT WITH THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS AND THE SOLDIER SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT IS BUT THOUGH I AM ROWING WITH ALL MY MIGHT
NO DOUBT A HORSE FAIR IS A VERY AMUSING PLACE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AT ANY RATE THERE IS PLENTY TO SEE
BUT SHE GAVE A VIOLENT KICK AND DASHED OFF INTO A HEADLONG GALLOP IT WAS SO SUDDEN THAT LADY ANNE WAS NEARLY UNSEATED BUT SHE SOON RECOVERED HERSELF I GAVE A LOUD SHRILL NEIGH FOR HELP
TILL WE CAME TO HIS GATE THERE WAS A SHORT DRIVE UP TO THE HOUSE BETWEEN TALL EVERGREENS BLANTYRE ALIGHTED AT THE GATE AND WAS GOING TO OPEN IT FOR LADY ANNE BUT SHE SAID I WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE
I WISH YOU LUCK WITH HIM THANK YOU GOVERNOR AND HE RODE ON WE SOON TURNED UP ONE OF THE SIDE STREETS AND ABOUT HALFWAY UP THAT WE TURNED INTO A VERY NARROW STREET WITH RATHER POOR LOOKING HOUSES ON ONE SIDE
AND NOT ANOTHER SIXPENCE YES OR NO DONE SAID THE SALESMAN AND YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THERE'S A MONSTROUS DEAL OF QUALITY IN THAT HORSE AND IF YOU WANT HIM FOR CAB WORK HE'S A BARGAIN
THERE WAS ONE MAN I THOUGHT IF HE WOULD BUY ME I SHOULD BE HAPPY HE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN NOR YET ONE OF THE LOUD FLASHY SORT THAT CALL THEMSELVES SO HE WAS RATHER A SMALL MAN BUT WELL MADE
THE ELDEST LEADING THE WAY AND THINKING HE HAD NO TIME TO LOSE HE JUMPED UP PUT ON THE CLOAK WHICH THE OLD WOMAN HAD GIVEN HIM AND FOLLOWED THEM BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAIRS HE TROD ON THE GOWN OF THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
THEN HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON HIS BED AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
BUT WHOEVER TRIED AND DID NOT SUCCEED AFTER THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH A KING'S SON SOON CAME HE WAS WELL ENTERTAINED AND IN THE EVENING
THE SOLDIER PLACED HIMSELF IN THE BOAT WITH THE ELDEST PRINCESS AND ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE THEY TOOK LEAVE OF EACH OTHER THE PRINCESSES PROMISING TO COME AGAIN THE NEXT NIGHT
IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE GINGER CAME BACK AND BEFORE WE WERE LEFT ALONE AND THEN SHE TOLD ME ALL THAT SHE HAD SEEN I CAN'T TELL MUCH SHE SAID WE WENT A GALLOP NEARLY ALL THE WAY
AND LOCKED UP BUT EVERY MORNING THEIR SHOES WERE FOUND TO BE QUITE WORN THROUGH AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DANCED IN ALL NIGHT AND YET NOBODY COULD FIND OUT HOW IT HAPPENED OR WHERE THEY HAD BEEN THEN THE KING MADE IT KNOWN TO ALL THE LAND
AND I HAVE FOLLOWED THE HOUNDS A GREAT MANY TIMES THOUGH I KNOW YOU DO NOT APPROVE OF LADIES HUNTING BUT STILL THAT IS THE FACT AND I INTEND TO TRY THIS LIZZIE
AS SOON AS THE TIME CAME WHEN HE WAS TO DECLARE THE SECRET HE WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE KING WITH THE THREE BRANCHES AND THE GOLDEN CUP AND THE TWELVE PRINCESSES STOOD LISTENING BEHIND THE DOOR TO HEAR WHAT HE WOULD SAY
NO SMELL OF OLD BEER AND TOBACCO WHICH I HATED BUT A FRESH SMELL AS IF HE HAD COME OUT OF A HAYLOFT HE OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS FOR ME BUT THAT WAS REFUSED AND HE WALKED AWAY
AND GLITTERED AND SPARKLED BEAUTIFULLY THE SOLDIER WISHED TO TAKE AWAY SOME TOKEN OF THE PLACE SO HE BROKE OFF A LITTLE BRANCH AND THERE CAME A LOUD NOISE FROM THE TREE THEN THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SAID AGAIN
BUT HE WALKED OFF ONE OR TWO MORE CAME WHO DID NOT MEAN BUSINESS THEN THE HARD FACED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN AND OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS A VERY CLOSE BARGAIN WAS BEING DRIVEN FOR MY SALESMAN
THE MONEY WAS PAID ON THE SPOT AND MY NEW MASTER TOOK MY HALTER AND LED ME OUT OF THE FAIR TO AN INN WHERE HE HAD A SADDLE AND BRIDLE READY HE GAVE ME A GOOD FEED OF OATS AND STOOD BY WHILE I ATE IT
AND WHETHER IT WAS THE STUPID COLT OR THE LOUD CRACKING OF THE WHIP
THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE WERE TAKEN OFF AND A CLOTH THROWN OVER ME GINGER WAS SADDLED AND SENT OFF IN GREAT HASTE FOR LORD GEORGE AND I SOON HEARD THE CARRIAGE ROLL OUT OF THE YARD
BUT MY PACE SOON CURED THAT DIFFICULTY AND HE FOUND THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO STICK TO THE SADDLE AND HOLD ME IN WHICH HE DID MANFULLY I SHOOK HIM AS LITTLE AS I COULD HELP BUT ONCE OR TWICE
WE HAD HARDLY TURNED ON THE COMMON WHEN WE CAUGHT SIGHT AGAIN OF THE GREEN HABIT FLYING ON BEFORE US MY LADY'S HAT WAS GONE AND HER LONG BROWN HAIR WAS STREAMING BEHIND HER HER HEAD AND BODY WERE THROWN BACK
HE THEN SOMEHOW SCRAMBLED INTO THE SADDLE AND WITH A GEE UP AND A CLAP ON MY SIDES WITH BOTH HIS LEGS HE STARTED ON HIS JOURNEY MAKING A LITTLE CIRCUIT TO AVOID THE DIKE HE HAD NO WHIP WHICH SEEMED TO TROUBLE HIM
BUT NOW WITH A LIGHT HAND AND A PRACTICED EYE HE GUIDED ME OVER THE GROUND IN SUCH A MASTERLY MANNER THAT MY PACE WAS SCARCELY SLACKENED AND WE WERE DECIDEDLY GAINING ON THEM
THERE WERE ALSO OPEN SPACES OF FINE SHORT GRASS WITH ANT HILLS AND MOLE TURNS EVERYWHERE
LONG BEFORE WE CAME TO THE BEND SHE WAS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH WAY HAD SHE TURNED A WOMAN WAS STANDING AT HER GARDEN GATE SHADING HER EYES WITH HER HAND AND LOOKING EAGERLY UP THE ROAD
SHE WAS UNCOMMON GOOD TO MY WIFE IN THE WINTER THEN MOUNT THIS HORSE MY FRIEND YOUR NECK WILL BE QUITE SAFE AND RIDE TO THE DOCTOR'S AND ASK HIM TO COME INSTANTLY
BEGAN TO THINK HE SHOULD NOT GET ALL HE ASKED AND MUST COME DOWN BUT JUST THEN THE GRAY EYED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP REACHING OUT MY HEAD TOWARD HIM HE STROKED MY FACE KINDLY
AGAIN AND AGAIN I NEIGHED PAWING THE GROUND IMPATIENTLY AND TOSSING MY HEAD TO GET THE REIN LOOSE I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BLANTYRE CAME RUNNING TO THE GATE HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ABOUT
LET ME BEG YOU TO HAVE THE SADDLES CHANGED MY DEAR COUSIN SAID LADY ANNE LAUGHING PRAY DO NOT TROUBLE YOUR GOOD CAREFUL HEAD ABOUT ME I HAVE BEEN A HORSEWOMAN EVER SINCE I WAS A BABY
BUT THE YOUNGEST SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS WHILE YOU ARE SO HAPPY I FEEL VERY UNEASY I AM SURE SOME MISCHANCE WILL BEFALL US YOU SIMPLETON SAID THE ELDEST YOU ARE ALWAYS AFRAID
STEADY WOAH STEADY ON THE HIGHROAD WE WERE ALL RIGHT AND AT THE DOCTOR'S AND THE HALL HE DID HIS ERRAND LIKE A GOOD MAN AND TRUE THEY ASKED HIM IN TO TAKE A DROP OF SOMETHING
LOOSENED HER COLLAR FELT HER HANDS AND WRIST THEN STARTED UP AND LOOKED WILDLY ROUND HIM FOR HELP AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE WERE TWO MEN CUTTING TURF WHO SEEING LIZZIE RUNNING WILD WITHOUT A RIDER
AND WAS SOON HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES LIZZIE WAS STANDING QUIETLY BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A FEW PACES OFF WITH HER BACK TO ME MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS SITTING EASILY WITH A LOOSE REIN
OPEN THE GATES AND MOTHER WILL BRING US THE LANTERN THE NEXT MINUTE THEY WERE ALL STANDING ROUND ME IN A SMALL STABLE YARD IS HE GENTLE FATHER YES DOLLY AS GENTLE AS YOUR OWN KITTEN COME AND PAT HIM
HAD LEFT THEIR WORK TO CATCH HER BLANTYRE'S HALLOO SOON BROUGHT THEM TO THE SPOT THE FOREMOST MAN SEEMED MUCH TROUBLED AT THE SIGHT AND ASKED WHAT HE COULD DO CAN YOU RIDE
AND GOT THERE JUST AS THE DOCTOR RODE UP THERE WAS A WOMAN SITTING ON THE GROUND WITH THE LADY'S HEAD IN HER LAP THE DOCTOR POURED SOMETHING INTO HER MOUTH BUT ALL THAT I HEARD WAS SHE IS NOT DEAD THEN I WAS LED OFF BY A MAN
TALKING TO HIMSELF AND TALKING TO ME HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO LONDON THROUGH PLEASANT LANES AND COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL WE CAME INTO THE GREAT LONDON THOROUGHFARE ON WHICH WE TRAVELED STEADILY
STAYING AT THE HALL HE ALWAYS RODE LIZZIE AND PRAISED HER SO MUCH THAT ONE DAY LADY ANNE ORDERED THE SIDE SADDLE TO BE PUT ON HER AND THE OTHER SADDLE ON ME WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR THE GENTLEMAN SEEMED VERY UNEASY
AT LAST IN PASSING THROUGH ONE WE CAME TO A LONG CAB STAND WHEN MY RIDER CALLED OUT IN A CHEERY VOICE GOOD NIGHT GOVERNOR HALLOO CRIED A VOICE HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD ONE I THINK SO REPLIED MY OWNER
ANOTHER BEND AND SHE WAS HIDDEN AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES WE CAUGHT GLIMPSES AND THEN LOST THEM WE SCARCELY SEEMED TO GAIN GROUND UPON THEM AT ALL AN OLD ROAD MENDER WAS STANDING NEAR A HEAP OF STONES
SO THAT WHEN SHE PUT THE CUP TO HER MOUTH IT WAS EMPTY AT THIS TOO THE YOUNGEST SISTER WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED BUT THE ELDEST ALWAYS SILENCED HER
WAS TAKEN TO THE CHAMBER NEXT TO THE ONE WHERE THE PRINCESSES LAY IN THEIR TWELVE BEDS THERE HE WAS TO SIT AND WATCH WHERE THEY WENT TO DANCE AND IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT PASS WITHOUT HIS HEARING IT THE DOOR OF HIS CHAMBER WAS LEFT OPEN
BUT GINGER WHO KNEW MORE OF HER THAN I DID TOLD ME SHE WAS RATHER NERVOUS
WE DO NOT GET ON SO FAST AS USUAL AND I AM QUITE TIRED THE BOAT SEEMS VERY HEAVY TODAY IT IS ONLY THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER SAID THE PRINCESS I FEEL IT VERY WARM TOO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE STOOD A FINE ILLUMINATED CASTLE
AND EVERY THING HAPPENED JUST AS BEFORE THE PRINCESSES DANCED EACH TIME TILL THEIR SHOES WERE WORN TO PIECES AND THEN RETURNED HOME HOWEVER ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE SOLDIER CARRIED AWAY ONE OF THE GOLDEN CUPS AS A TOKEN OF WHERE HE HAD BEEN
BUT THE KING'S SON SOON FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE IN THE MORNING HE FOUND THAT THE PRINCESSES HAD ALL BEEN DANCING FOR THE SOLES OF THEIR SHOES WERE FULL OF HOLES THE SAME THING HAPPENED THE SECOND AND THIRD NIGHT SO THE KING
TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AFTER AWHILE SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE CARRIAGE AND WE CAME HOME TOGETHER I HEARD MY MASTER SAY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO STOPPED HIM TO INQUIRE THAT HE HOPED NO BONES WERE BROKEN BUT THAT SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN YET
WELL OLD CHAP HE SAID I THINK WE SHOULD SUIT EACH OTHER I'LL GIVE TWENTY FOUR FOR HIM SAY TWENTY FIVE AND YOU SHALL HAVE HIM TWENTY FOUR TEN SAID MY FRIEND IN A VERY DECIDED TONE
I WAS PUT WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER STRONG USEFUL LOOKING HORSES AND A GOOD MANY PEOPLE CAME TO LOOK AT US THE GENTLEMEN ALWAYS TURNED FROM ME WHEN THEY SAW MY BROKEN KNEES
BUT THE ELDEST SAID IT IS ONLY OUR PRINCES WHO ARE SHOUTING FOR JOY AT OUR APPROACH THEN THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GROVE OF TREES WHERE ALL THE LEAVES WERE OF GOLD AND AFTERWARDS TO A THIRD WHERE THE LEAVES WERE ALL GLITTERING DIAMONDS
HOW IS THIS HE SAID ARE YOU TIRED OF YOUR GOOD BLACK AUSTER OH NO NOT AT ALL SHE REPLIED BUT I AM AMIABLE ENOUGH TO LET YOU RIDE HIM FOR ONCE
AND QUICK IN ALL HIS MOTIONS I KNEW IN A MOMENT BY THE WAY HE HANDLED ME THAT HE WAS USED TO HORSES HE SPOKE GENTLY AND HIS GRAY EYE HAD A KINDLY CHEERY LOOK IN IT IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO SAY
AND EAGER AS SHE HAD LONG BEEN TO QUIT IT COULD NOT WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT BID ADIEU TO THE HOUSE IN WHICH SHE HAD FOR THE LAST TIME ENJOYED THOSE HOPES AND THAT CONFIDENCE IN WILLOUGHBY WHICH WERE NOW EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER WITHOUT GREAT PAIN
STEALING AWAY THROUGH THE WINDING SHRUBBERIES NOW JUST BEGINNING TO BE IN BEAUTY TO GAIN A DISTANT EMINENCE WHERE FROM ITS GRECIAN TEMPLE HER EYE WANDERING OVER A WIDE TRACT OF COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH EAST
AND TOLERABLY EARLY IN THE DAY THE TWO PARTIES FROM HANOVER SQUARE AND BERKELEY STREET SET OUT FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES TO MEET BY APPOINTMENT ON THE ROAD FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF CHARLOTTE AND HER CHILD
AND THAT ALL OUR OLD FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS WERE MOMENTARILY FORGOTTEN AND STRANGE THAT NIGHT WHEN HE POINTED OUT THE STARS TO US FROM THE PULPIT STONE WAS THE LAST TIME FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THAT PETER SHARED OUR TOIL AND PASTIME
AND TOLD HER WHAT HE MEANT TO DO HIMSELF TOWARDS REMOVING THEM HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER IN THIS AS WELL AS IN EVERY OTHER PARTICULAR HIS OPEN PLEASURE IN MEETING HER AFTER AN ABSENCE OF ONLY TEN DAYS HIS READINESS TO CONVERSE WITH HER
JUST THINK HOW DREADFUL IT WOULD BE IF OUR FATHER HAD LEFT US LIKE THAT OUR FATHER IS A KING SAID FELICITY LOFTILY AND PETER'S FATHER WAS ONLY A CRAIG A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY COULDN'T BEHAVE LIKE THAT
WAVED BLOOD RED BANNERS OVER THE SOMBRE CONE BEARERS THE STORY GIRL GENERALLY HAD HER HEAD GARLANDED WITH THEIR LEAVES THEY BECAME HER VASTLY
FELIX ALONE MUST UNJUSTLY AND SPITEFULLY DECLARED THAT PETER WAS SIMPLY SHIRKING HE'S JUST LAZY THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM HE SAID
AND GREAT CITIES SPRANG UP WHERE HE HAD TRODDEN AND EVERY LAND THROUGH WHICH HE PASSED WAS BLESSED BECAUSE ONE OF THE GODS HAD COME DOWN TO MEN BUT MANY MEN AND WOMEN FOLLOWED ODIN HIMSELF
THOU MAYEST RETURN TO EARTH IF THOU FEAREST TO ESSAY THE FLOOD SAID THE WARDER NAY SAID VING WILDLY EARTHLY LIFE WITHOUT ALIN IS MORE DREADFUL THAN THE DEATH WHICH AWAITS ME IN YON DARK RIVER
GIVING UP ALL THEIR WORLDLY POSSESSIONS AND AMBITIONS AND TO THESE HE PROMISED THE GIFT OF ETERNAL LIFE ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE GOOD AND NOBLE AND UNSELFISH AND KIND BUT THE BEST AND NOBLEST OF THEM ALL WAS A YOUTH NAMED VING
HIS HIND LEGS CAUGHT IN THE RING AND HE FELL TO THE FLOOR IN A HEAP WHEN HE GOT UP HE WAS LAME AND COULD HARDLY LIMP AS FAR AS THE STABLE PINOCCHIO WE WANT PINOCCHIO WE WANT THE LITTLE DONKEY
THE WILD COLD SPRAY BEAT ON HIS EYES AND BLINDED HIM SO THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING AND THE ROAR OF THE RIVER DEAFENED HIM SO THAT HE COULD HEAR NOTHING BUT HE FELT KEENLY THE WOUNDS AND BRUISES OF THE CRUEL ROCKS
AS SOON AS THE BUYER HAD PAID THE FOUR CENTS THE DONKEY CHANGED HANDS HIS NEW OWNER TOOK HIM TO A HIGH CLIFF OVERLOOKING THE SEA PUT A STONE AROUND HIS NECK TIED A ROPE TO ONE OF HIS HIND FEET GAVE HIM A PUSH
AS IF THE GOLD AND FLAME OF HER SPIRIT HAD BROKEN OUT IN A CORONAL AS MUCH A PART OF HER AS THE PALE HALO SEEMS A PART OF THE MADONNA IT ENCIRCLES WHAT TALES SHE TOLD US ON THOSE FAR AWAY AUTUMN DAYS
BUT IT WAS HARD TOO AND OUR ARMS AND BACKS ACHED ROUNDLY AT NIGHT IN THE MORNINGS IT WAS VERY DELIGHTFUL IN THE AFTERNOONS TOLERABLE BUT IN THE EVENINGS WE LAGGED AND THE LAUGHTER AND ZEST OF FRESHER HOURS WERE LACKING
FORD THAT FLOOD ON THE FURTHEST BANK IS THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE THOU MOCKEST ME MUTTERED VING SULLENLY NO MORTAL COULD CROSS THAT FLOOD OH MASTER HE PRAYED TURNING BESEECHINGLY TO ODIN
BUT INSTEAD OF WORDS A LOUD BRAYING WAS HEARD IN THE THEATER SO LOUD AND SO LONG THAT ALL THE SPECTATORS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN BUT ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN BURST OUT LAUGHING
FOR NOT ONLY WAS IT CONSIDERED AS HER FUTURE HOME BY HER BROTHER AND MISSUS JENNINGS BUT EVEN LUCY WHEN THEY PARTED GAVE HER A PRESSING INVITATION TO VISIT HER THERE VERY EARLY IN APRIL
A GREAT SASH OF GOLD AND SILVER WAS FASTENED AROUND HIS WAIST AND HIS TAIL WAS DECORATED WITH RIBBONS OF MANY BRILLIANT COLORS HE WAS A HANDSOME DONKEY INDEED THE MANAGER WHEN INTRODUCING HIM TO THE PUBLIC
PETER AND THE STORY GIRL KNEW ALL ABOUT THEM AND IMPARTED THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO US GENEROUSLY I RECALL PETER STANDING ON THE PULPIT STONE ONE NIGHT ERE MOONRISE AND POINTING THEM OUT TO US
THE MORNING WAS FINE AND DRY AND MARIANNE IN HER PLAN OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD HAD NOT CALCULATED FOR ANY CHANGE OF WEATHER DURING THEIR STAY AT CLEVELAND WITH GREAT SURPRISE THEREFORE
AND HE STARTED TO YAWN FROM HUNGER AS HE YAWNED HE OPENED A MOUTH AS
WITH A MORE WARM THOUGH LESS PUBLIC ASSURANCE FROM JOHN TO ELINOR OF THE PROMPTITUDE WITH WHICH HE SHOULD COME TO SEE HER AT DELAFORD WAS ALL THAT FORETOLD ANY MEETING IN THE COUNTRY
BUT AS IT WAS SUCH A NOTION HAD SCARCELY EVER ENTERED HER HEAD EXCEPT BY MISSUS JENNINGS'S SUGGESTION AND SHE COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING HERSELF THE NICEST OBSERVER OF THE TWO SHE WATCHED HIS EYES WHILE MISSUS JENNINGS THOUGHT ONLY OF HIS BEHAVIOUR
NOR COULD SHE LEAVE THE PLACE IN WHICH WILLOUGHBY REMAINED BUSY IN NEW ENGAGEMENTS AND NEW SCHEMES IN WHICH SHE COULD HAVE NO SHARE
GREAT SPECTACLE TONIGHT LEAPS AND EXERCISES BY THE GREAT ARTISTS AND THE FAMOUS HORSES OF THE COMPANY FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE OF THE FAMOUS DONKEY CALLED PINOCCHIO THE STAR OF THE DANCE
THEY WERE TO BE MORE THAN TWO DAYS ON THEIR JOURNEY AND MISTER PALMER TRAVELLING MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY WITH COLONEL BRANDON WAS TO JOIN THEM AT CLEVELAND SOON AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL MARIANNE FEW AS HAD BEEN HER HOURS OF COMFORT IN LONDON
AND IN VISITING HER POULTRY YARD WHERE IN THE DISAPPOINTED HOPES OF HER DAIRY MAID BY HENS FORSAKING THEIR NESTS OR BEING STOLEN BY A FOX OR IN THE RAPID DECREASE OF A PROMISING YOUNG BROOD SHE FOUND FRESH SOURCES OF MERRIMENT
ODIN WAS THE GREAT GOD OF THE NORTHLAND YOU KNOW AND WHEREVER HE WENT AMONG MEN HE TAUGHT THEM LOVE AND BROTHERHOOD AND SKILFUL ARTS
HAD NOT THE THOUGHT OF SWEET ALIN'S LOVING EYES BROUGHT HIM THE STRENGTH AND DESIRE TO STRUGGLE AS LONG AS IT WAS POSSIBLE LONG LONG LONG TO HIM SEEMED THAT BITTER AND PERILOUS PASSAGE
WE STOPPED PICKING APPLES SAT DOWN ON THE GRASS AND TRIED TO REASON IT OUT
THEY SAY THERE MUST BE A BLACK SHEEP IN EVERY FAMILY SAID THE STORY GIRL THERE ISN'T ANY IN OURS SAID CECILY LOYALLY WHY DO WHITE SHEEP EAT MORE THAN BLACK ASKED FELIX
AND CONFIRMING HER OWN THEIR JOURNEY WAS SAFELY PERFORMED THE SECOND DAY BROUGHT THEM INTO THE CHERISHED OR THE PROHIBITED COUNTY OF SOMERSET FOR AS SUCH WAS IT DWELT ON BY TURNS IN MARIANNE'S IMAGINATION
WHERE THE RAINBOW TOUCHED THE EARTH AND THE RAINBOW WAS A GREAT BRIDGE BUILT OF LIVING COLOURS SO DAZZLING AND WONDERFUL THAT BEYOND IT THE EYE COULD SEE NOTHING ONLY FAR AWAY A GREAT BLINDING SPARKLING GLORY
CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT THE TALE OF THE RAINBOW BRIDGE FELIX SO FAR AS MY REMEMBRANCE GOES NEVER ATTAINED TO SUCCESS IN THE ORDEAL OF BITTER APPLES HE GAVE UP TRYING AFTER AWHILE
THAT THEY MIGHT DRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE BEYOND AND THE WARDER SET OPEN THE GATE PASS ON AND DRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN HE SAID TO ALL WHO TASTE OF IT SHALL IMMORTALITY BE GIVEN
PINOCCHIO OBEDIENTLY BENT HIS TWO KNEES TO THE GROUND AND REMAINED KNEELING UNTIL THE MANAGER WITH THE CRACK OF THE WHIP CRIED SHARPLY WALK THE DONKEY LIFTED HIMSELF ON HIS FOUR FEET AND WALKED AROUND THE RING
WE USED TO THROW THEM UP IN THE AIR AND LET THEM FALL ON THE GROUND UNTIL THEY WERE BRUISED AND BATTERED TO THE BURSTING POINT THEN WE SUCKED ON THE JUICE
AFFORDING A PLEASANT ENLARGEMENT OF THE PARTY AND A VERY WELCOME VARIETY TO THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH A LONG MORNING OF THE SAME CONTINUED RAIN HAD REDUCED VERY LOW ELINOR HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF MISTER PALMER AND IN THAT LITTLE
HAD SEEN SO MUCH VARIETY IN HIS ADDRESS TO HER SISTER AND HERSELF THAT SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO EXPECT TO FIND HIM IN HIS OWN FAMILY SHE FOUND HIM HOWEVER PERFECTLY THE GENTLEMAN IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ALL HIS VISITORS
A SHOWER OF APPLAUSE GREETED THE DONKEY AS HE AROSE TO HIS FEET CRIES AND SHOUTS AND HANDCLAPPINGS WERE HEARD ON ALL SIDES AT ALL THAT NOISE PINOCCHIO LIFTED HIS HEAD AND RAISED HIS EYES
SINCE FELIX SOLEMNLY VOWED CROSS HIS HEART WHITE SHEEP DID EAT MORE THAN BLACK
STRONG NOBLE AND VALIANT HE SAID RAINBOW BRIDGE IS NOT FOR THEE VERY DARK GREW VING'S FACE HOT REBELLION ROSE IN HIS HEART AND RUSHED OVER HIS PALE LIPS
WHO HAD BEEN INTO DORSETSHIRE LATELY AND WHO TREATING HER AT ONCE AS THE DISINTERESTED FRIEND OF MISTER FERRARS AND THE KIND OF CONFIDANT OF HIMSELF TALKED TO HER A GREAT DEAL OF THE PARSONAGE AT DELAFORD DESCRIBED ITS DEFICIENCIES
THAT BEAUTIFUL LADY IS MY FAIRY SAID PINOCCHIO TO HIMSELF RECOGNIZING HER HE FELT SO HAPPY THAT HE TRIED HIS BEST TO CRY OUT OH MY FAIRY MY OWN FAIRY
THIS SPEECH WAS GREETED BY MUCH LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE AND THE APPLAUSE GREW TO A ROAR WHEN PINOCCHIO THE FAMOUS DONKEY APPEARED IN THE CIRCUS RING HE WAS HANDSOMELY ARRAYED
BUT PINOCCHIO DID NOT LIKE THAT ANY BETTER AH YOU DON'T LIKE HAY EITHER HE CRIED ANGRILY WAIT MY PRETTY DONKEY I'LL TEACH YOU NOT TO BE SO PARTICULAR WITHOUT MORE ADO HE TOOK A WHIP
ONE OTHER SHORT CALL IN HARLEY STREET IN WHICH ELINOR RECEIVED HER BROTHER'S CONGRATULATIONS ON THEIR TRAVELLING SO FAR TOWARDS BARTON WITHOUT ANY EXPENSE
FOR HIS BEAUTY AND STRENGTH AND GOODNESS ALWAYS HE WALKED ON ODIN'S RIGHT HAND AND ALWAYS THE FIRST LIGHT OF ODIN'S SMILE FELL ON HIM
BUT I HAVE FOUND IN HIM ONE GREAT REDEEMING FEATURE DO YOU SEE THIS LITTLE BUMP ON HIS FOREHEAD IT IS THIS BUMP WHICH GIVES HIM HIS GREAT TALENT OF DANCING AND USING HIS FEET AS NIMBLY AS A HUMAN BEING
AND HIS DEFERENCE FOR HER OPINION MIGHT VERY WELL JUSTIFY MISSUS JENNINGS'S PERSUASION OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH PERHAPS HAD NOT ELINOR STILL AS FROM THE FIRST BELIEVED MARIANNE HIS REAL FAVOURITE TO MAKE HER SUSPECT IT HERSELF
BUT AT LAST HE WON THROUGH TO THE FURTHEST SIDE BREATHLESS AND REELING HIS VESTURE TORN HIS GREAT WOUNDS BLEEDING HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE SHORE WHERE THE FOUNTAIN OF IMMORTALITY SPRANG UP
COULD FONDLY REST ON THE FARTHEST RIDGE OF HILLS IN THE HORIZON AND FANCY THAT FROM THEIR SUMMITS COMBE MAGNA MIGHT BE SEEN IN SUCH MOMENTS OF PRECIOUS INVALUABLE MISERY
A SHOWER CAME UP IN THE EVENING AND WE HAD TO STOP PICKING AFTER THE SHOWER THERE WAS A MAGNIFICENT DOUBLE RAINBOW WE WATCHED IT FROM THE GRANARY WINDOW AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US AN OLD LEGEND CULLED
CRIED THE BOYS FROM THE ORCHESTRA SADDENED BY THE ACCIDENT NO ONE SAW PINOCCHIO AGAIN THAT EVENING THE NEXT MORNING THE VETERINARY THAT IS THE ANIMAL DOCTOR DECLARED THAT HE WOULD BE LAME FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
THE DAY CAME AT LAST WHEN PINOCCHIO'S MASTER WAS ABLE TO ANNOUNCE AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE THE ANNOUNCEMENTS POSTED ALL AROUND THE TOWN AND WRITTEN IN LARGE LETTERS READ THUS
THE MOUNTAIN ASH AND THE ACACIA AND A THICK SCREEN OF THEM ALTOGETHER INTERSPERSED WITH TALL LOMBARDY POPLARS SHUT OUT THE OFFICES MARIANNE ENTERED THE HOUSE WITH A HEART SWELLING WITH EMOTION
THOSE TWO GIRLS WERE OF A DOMESTIC TYPE THAT ASSORTED ILL WITH THE WILDFIRE IN NATURE'S VEINS BUT WHEN THE STORY GIRL WREATHED HER NUT BROWN TRESSES WITH CRIMSON LEAVES IT SEEMED AS PETER SAID THAT THEY GREW ON HER
IT AMUSED HER TO OBSERVE THAT ALL HER FRIENDS SEEMED DETERMINED TO SEND HER TO DELAFORD A PLACE IN WHICH OF ALL OTHERS SHE WOULD NOW LEAST CHUSE TO VISIT OR WISH TO RESIDE
WHEN THE FIRST PART OF THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER THE OWNER AND MANAGER OF THE CIRCUS IN A BLACK COAT WHITE KNEE BREECHES AND PATENT LEATHER BOOTS PRESENTED HIMSELF TO THE PUBLIC AND IN A LOUD POMPOUS VOICE MADE THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT
FELICITY HAS NOT GOTTEN OVER THAT TO THIS DAY CECILY DEAR HEART SENT MOST OF HERS TO THE HOSPITAL IN TOWN AND NO DOUBT GATHERED IN THEREFROM DIVIDENDS OF GRATITUDE AND SATISFACTION OF SOUL
PEOPLING THE RUSSET ARCADES WITH FOLK OF AN ELDER WORLD MANY A PRINCESS RODE BY US ON HER PALFREY MANY A SWAGGERING GALLANT RUFFLED IT BRAVELY IN VELVET AND PLUME ADOWN UNCLE STEPHEN'S WALK MANY A STATELY LADY SILKEN CLAD
A FEW MINUTES PASSED AND AGAIN THE VOICE OF THE MANAGER CALLED QUICKSTEP AND PINOCCHIO OBEDIENTLY CHANGED HIS STEP GALLOP AND PINOCCHIO GALLOPED FULL SPEED
HE HAD EATEN IT ALL DURING THE NIGHT HE TRIED THE STRAW BUT AS HE CHEWED AWAY AT IT HE NOTICED TO HIS GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT THAT IT TASTED NEITHER LIKE RICE NOR LIKE MACARONI PATIENCE HE REPEATED AS HE CHEWED
SHE WAS PLEASED TO BE FREE HERSELF FROM THE PERSECUTION OF LUCY'S FRIENDSHIP SHE WAS GRATEFUL FOR BRINGING HER SISTER AWAY UNSEEN BY WILLOUGHBY SINCE HIS MARRIAGE AND SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH HOPE TO WHAT A FEW MONTHS OF TRANQUILITY AT BARTON MIGHT DO TOWARDS RESTORING MARIANNE'S PEACE OF MIND
FROM ONE OF AUNT OLIVIA'S MANY SCRAPBOOKS LONG LONG AGO IN THE GOLDEN AGE WHEN THE GODS USED TO VISIT THE EARTH SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS NOTHING UNCOMMON TO SEE THEM ODIN MADE A PILGRIMAGE OVER THE WORLD
A NEW BRIDLE OF SHINING LEATHER WITH BUCKLES OF POLISHED BRASS WAS ON HIS BACK TWO WHITE CAMELLIAS WERE TIED TO HIS EARS RIBBONS AND TASSELS OF RED SILK ADORNED HIS MANE WHICH WAS DIVIDED INTO MANY CURLS
SHE RETURNED JUST IN TIME TO JOIN THE OTHERS AS THEY QUITTED THE HOUSE ON AN EXCURSION THROUGH ITS MORE IMMEDIATE PREMISES AND THE REST OF THE MORNING WAS EASILY WHILED AWAY IN LOUNGING ROUND THE KITCHEN GARDEN EXAMINING THE BLOOM UPON ITS WALLS
WE MIGHT DISPOSE OF THEM AS WE WILLED FELICITY SOLD HERS TO UNCLE ALEC'S HIRED MAN AND WAS BADLY CHEATED TO BOOT FOR HE LEVANTED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS TAKING THE APPLES WITH HIM HAVING PAID HER ONLY HALF HER RIGHTFUL DUE
HE STAGGERED TO ITS BRINK AND DRANK OF ITS CLEAR STREAM THEN ALL PAIN AND WEARINESS FELL AWAY FROM HIM AND HE ROSE UP A GOD BEAUTIFUL WITH IMMORTALITY
AND HE WEPT BITTERLY NO ONE KNEW IT HOWEVER LEAST OF ALL THE MANAGER WHO CRACKING HIS WHIP CRIED OUT BRAVO PINOCCHIO NOW SHOW US HOW GRACEFULLY YOU CAN JUMP THROUGH THE RINGS
AS HE MUST FEEL HIMSELF TO BE TO MISSUS JENNINGS AND CHARLOTTE FOR THE REST OF HIS CHARACTER AND HABITS THEY WERE MARKED AS FAR AS ELINOR COULD PERCEIVE WITH NO TRAITS AT ALL UNUSUAL IN HIS SEX AND TIME OF LIFE HE WAS NICE IN HIS EATING
AND HE PLUNGED FIERCELY IN HE SWAM AND STRUGGLED HE BUFFETTED THE TURMOIL THE WAVES WENT OVER HIS HEAD AGAIN AND AGAIN THE WHIRLPOOLS CAUGHT HIM AND FLUNG HIM ON THE CRUEL ROCKS
OBSERVE I BEG OF YOU THE SAVAGE LOOK OF HIS EYE ALL THE MEANS USED BY CENTURIES OF CIVILIZATION IN SUBDUING WILD BEASTS FAILED IN THIS CASE I HAD FINALLY TO RESORT TO THE GENTLE LANGUAGE OF THE WHIP
AND GAVE THE DONKEY A HEARTY BLOW ACROSS THE LEGS PINOCCHIO SCREAMED WITH PAIN AND AS HE SCREAMED HE BRAYED HAW HAW HAW I CAN'T DIGEST STRAW THEN EAT THE HAY ANSWERED HIS MASTER
AND EVEN TO STAND ON YOUR HEAD POOR PINOCCHIO WHETHER HE LIKED IT OR NOT HAD TO LEARN ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS BUT IT TOOK HIM THREE LONG MONTHS AND COST HIM MANY MANY LASHINGS BEFORE HE WAS PRONOUNCED PERFECT
PINOCCHIO TRIED TWO OR THREE TIMES BUT EACH TIME HE CAME NEAR THE RING HE FOUND IT MORE TO HIS TASTE TO GO UNDER IT THE FOURTH TIME AT A LOOK FROM HIS MASTER HE LEAPED THROUGH IT BUT AS HE DID SO
AND LIKE EVERY OTHER PLACE OF THE SAME DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE IT HAD ITS OPEN SHRUBBERY AND CLOSER WOOD WALK A ROAD OF SMOOTH GRAVEL WINDING ROUND A PLANTATION LED TO THE FRONT THE LAWN WAS DOTTED OVER WITH TIMBER THE HOUSE ITSELF WAS UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE FIR
IS THAT A CONUNDRUM ASKED CECILY CAUTIOUSLY IF IT IS I WON'T TRY TO GUESS THE REASON I NEVER CAN GUESS CONUNDRUMS IT ISN'T A CONUNDRUM SAID FELIX IT'S A FACT THEY DO AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR IT
THE THEATER WILL BE AS LIGHT AS DAY THAT NIGHT AS YOU CAN WELL IMAGINE THE THEATER WAS FILLED TO OVERFLOWING ONE HOUR BEFORE THE SHOW WAS SCHEDULED TO START NOT AN ORCHESTRA CHAIR COULD BE HAD
THE MOST FAMOUS DONKEY IN THE WORLD A DONKEY THAT HAS HAD THE GREAT HONOR IN HIS SHORT LIFE OF PERFORMING BEFORE THE KINGS AND QUEENS AND EMPERORS OF ALL THE GREAT COURTS OF EUROPE WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
FOUR DOLLARS I'LL GIVE YOU FOUR CENTS DON'T THINK I'M BUYING HIM FOR WORK I WANT ONLY HIS SKIN IT LOOKS VERY TOUGH AND I CAN USE IT TO MAKE MYSELF A DRUMHEAD I BELONG TO A MUSICAL BAND IN MY VILLAGE AND I NEED A DRUM
AND FINALLY GAVE THE DOOR SUCH A VIOLENT KICK THAT IT FLEW OPEN WITH HIS USUAL SWEET SMILE ON HIS LIPS HE LOOKED AT PINOCCHIO AND LAMP WICK AND SAID TO THEM FINE WORK BOYS YOU HAVE BRAYED WELL
THEN IN ORDER TO TEACH THE DONKEY THAT IT WAS NOT GOOD MANNERS TO BRAY BEFORE THE PUBLIC THE MANAGER HIT HIM ON THE NOSE WITH THE HANDLE OF THE WHIP THE POOR LITTLE DONKEY STUCK OUT A LONG TONGUE AND LICKED HIS NOSE FOR A LONG TIME
CHAPTER THIRTY THREE PINOCCHIO HAVING BECOME A DONKEY IS BOUGHT BY THE OWNER OF A CIRCUS WHO WANTS TO TEACH HIM TO DO TRICKS THE DONKEY BECOMES LAME AND IS SOLD TO A MAN WHO WANTS TO USE HIS SKIN FOR A DRUMHEAD
BUT HOW MUCH HAPPIER I SHOULD BE IF I HAD STUDIED JUST NOW INSTEAD OF HAY I SHOULD BE EATING SOME GOOD BREAD AND BUTTER PATIENCE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE AWOKE PINOCCHIO LOOKED IN THE MANGER FOR MORE HAY
NOT A BALCONY SEAT NOR A GALLERY SEAT NOT EVEN FOR THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD THE PLACE SWARMED WITH BOYS AND GIRLS OF ALL AGES AND SIZES WRIGGLING AND DANCING ABOUT IN A FEVER OF IMPATIENCE TO SEE THE FAMOUS DONKEY DANCE
SHE LIKED HIM HOWEVER UPON THE WHOLE MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND IN HER HEART WAS NOT SORRY THAT SHE COULD LIKE HIM NO MORE NOT SORRY TO BE DRIVEN BY THE OBSERVATION OF HIS EPICURISM HIS SELFISHNESS AND HIS CONCEIT
AND ONLY OCCASIONALLY RUDE TO HIS WIFE AND HER MOTHER SHE FOUND HIM VERY CAPABLE OF BEING A PLEASANT COMPANION AND ONLY PREVENTED FROM BEING SO ALWAYS BY TOO GREAT AN APTITUDE TO FANCY HIMSELF AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE IN GENERAL
OCCASIONALLY HAVING A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH THE STORY GIRL OVER THE NAME OF SOME PARTICULAR STAR JOB'S COFFIN AND THE NORTHERN CROSS WERE TO THE WEST OF US SOUTH OF US FLAMED FOMALHAUT
CECILY AND FELIX WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD DISTINGUISH THE DOUBLE STAR IN THE HANDLE OF THE BIG DIPPER AND GREATLY DID THEY PLUME THEMSELVES THEREON THE STORY GIRL TOLD US THE MYTHS AND LEGENDS WOVEN AROUND THESE IMMEMORIAL CLUSTERS
UNCLE ROGER SAYS PETER'S FATHER WASN'T EXACTLY LAZY SAID THE STORY GIRL THE TROUBLE WAS THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER THINGS HE LIKED BETTER THAN WORK
THE OPENNESS AND HEARTINESS OF HER MANNER MORE THAN ATONED FOR THAT WANT OF RECOLLECTION AND ELEGANCE WHICH MADE HER OFTEN DEFICIENT IN THE FORMS OF POLITENESS HER KINDNESS RECOMMENDED BY SO PRETTY A FACE WAS ENGAGING HER FOLLY
THE GREAT SQUARE OF PEGASUS WAS OVER OUR HEADS CASSIOPEIA SAT ENTHRONED IN HER BEAUTIFUL CHAIR IN THE NORTH EAST AND NORTH OF US THE DIPPERS SWUNG UNTIRINGLY AROUND THE POLE STAR
THERE WAS A WARDER OF THE BRIDGE A GOD DARK AND STERN AND SORROWFUL AND TO HIM ODIN GAVE COMMAND THAT HE SHOULD OPEN THE GATE AND ALLOW HIS FOLLOWERS TO CROSS THE RAINBOW BRIDGE
ADMIRE HIM O SIGNORI AND ENJOY YOURSELVES I LET YOU NOW BE THE JUDGES OF MY SUCCESS AS A TEACHER OF ANIMALS BEFORE I LEAVE YOU I WISH TO STATE THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER PERFORMANCE TOMORROW NIGHT
AND THREW HIM INTO THE WATER PINOCCHIO SANK IMMEDIATELY AND HIS NEW MASTER SAT ON THE CLIFF WAITING FOR HIM TO DROWN
AND WHILE HIS LOOKS OF ANXIOUS SOLICITUDE ON MARIANNE'S FEELING IN HER HEAD AND THROAT THE BEGINNING OF A HEAVY COLD BECAUSE UNEXPRESSED BY WORDS ENTIRELY ESCAPED THE LATTER LADY'S OBSERVATION SHE COULD DISCOVER IN THEM THE QUICK FEELINGS
THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU HERE ONLY TO GIVE YOU FOOD AND DRINK OH NO YOU ARE TO HELP ME EARN SOME FINE GOLD PIECES DO YOU HEAR COME ALONG NOW I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU TO JUMP AND BOW
BUT ONLY TO THAT ONE WHO SHALL DRINK OF IT FIRST SHALL BE PERMITTED TO WALK AT ODIN'S RIGHT HAND FOREVER THEN THE COMPANY PASSED THROUGH IN GREAT HASTE ALL FIRED WITH A DESIRE
WE WERE ALL OF US TOO TIRED THOSE NIGHTS TO DO ANY SPECIAL PRAYING SOMETIMES I FEAR OUR REGULAR PRAYERS WERE SLURRED OVER OR MUMBLED IN ANYTHING BUT REVERENT HASTE
AND WONDERED WHETHER MISTER PALMER AND COLONEL BRANDON WOULD GET FARTHER THAN READING THAT NIGHT ELINOR HOWEVER LITTLE CONCERNED IN IT JOINED IN THEIR DISCOURSE AND MARIANNE WHO HAD THE KNACK OF FINDING HER WAY IN EVERY HOUSE TO THE LIBRARY
IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD BECOME A MILLIONAIRE WHAT HAPPENED TO LAMP WICK MY DEAR CHILDREN I DO NOT KNOW PINOCCHIO I CAN TELL YOU MET WITH GREAT HARDSHIPS EVEN FROM THE FIRST DAY
OCTOBER WAS A BUSY MONTH ON THE HILL FARMS THE APPLES HAD TO BE PICKED AND THIS WORK FELL MAINLY TO US CHILDREN WE STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL TO DO IT IT WAS PLEASANT WORK AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FUN IN IT
HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE AVOIDED BY THE FAMILY IN GENERAL SOON PROCURED HERSELF A BOOK NOTHING WAS WANTING ON MISSUS PALMER'S SIDE THAT CONSTANT AND FRIENDLY GOOD HUMOUR COULD DO TO MAKE THEM FEEL THEMSELVES WELCOME
TO REST WITH COMPLACENCY ON THE REMEMBRANCE OF EDWARD'S GENEROUS TEMPER SIMPLE TASTE AND DIFFIDENT FEELINGS OF EDWARD OR AT LEAST OF SOME OF HIS CONCERNS SHE NOW RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE FROM COLONEL BRANDON
COMPLETED THE INTERCOURSE OF THE BROTHER AND SISTERS IN TOWN AND A FAINT INVITATION FROM FANNY TO COME TO NORLAND WHENEVER IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE IN THEIR WAY WHICH OF ALL THINGS WAS THE MOST UNLIKELY TO OCCUR
MINGLED WITH THE WOODSY ODOURS OF THE WITHERING GRASSES THE HENS AND TURKEYS PROWLED ABOUT PECKING AT WINDFALLS AND PAT MADE MAD RUSHES AT THEM AMID THE FALLEN LEAVES
TALL AND STRAIGHT WAS HE AS A YOUNG PINE AND HIS LONG HAIR WAS THE COLOUR OF RIPE WHEAT IN THE SUN AND HIS BLUE EYES WERE LIKE THE NORTHLAND HEAVENS ON A STARRY NIGHT IN ODIN'S BAND WAS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN NAMED ALIN
THIS HORRID LITTLE BEING WHOSE FACE SHONE WITH KINDNESS WENT ABOUT THE WORLD LOOKING FOR BOYS LAZY BOYS BOYS WHO HATED BOOKS BOYS WHO WANTED TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME BOYS WHO WERE TIRED OF SCHOOL ALL THESE WERE HIS JOY
YOU KNOW SIR WHAT A DANGEROUS THING IT IS FOR AN ILL NATURED WOMAN TO BE MARRIED TO A DOCTOR INCENSED AT THE BEHAVIOUR OF HIS WIFE HE ONE DAY GAVE HER SO EFFECTUAL A REMEDY TO CURE HER OF A SLIGHT COLD
WHEREAS MARTIN HAD NOTHING AT ALL TO HOPE BESIDES CANDIDE WAS POSSESSED OF MONEY AND JEWELS
I CONCLUDED THAT I KNEW AS MUCH AS HE AND THAT I HAD NO NEED OF A GUIDE TO LEARN IGNORANCE HA HERE ARE FOUR SCORE VOLUMES OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CRIED MARTIN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING VALUABLE IN THIS COLLECTION
HITHERTO I HAVE MET WITH NONE BUT UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE HABITABLE GLOBE EXCEPT IN EL DORADO BUT AS TO THIS PAIR I WOULD VENTURE TO LAY A WAGER THAT THEY ARE VERY HAPPY I LAY YOU THEY ARE NOT SAID MARTIN
BUT RECOLLECTING HER AS SHE SPOKE ALAS SAID HE MY POOR CHILD IT IS YOU WHO REDUCED DOCTOR PANGLOSS TO THE BEAUTIFUL CONDITION IN WHICH I SAW HIM ALAS IT WAS I SIR INDEED ANSWERED PAQUETTE
SIR ANSWERED MARTIN OUR PRIESTS ACCUSED ME OF BEING A SOCINIAN
CANDIDE BEING DESIROUS OF SELECTING FROM AMONG THE BEST MARKED OUT ABOUT ONE TWENTIETH OF THEM WHO SEEMED TO BE SOCIABLE MEN AND WHO ALL PRETENDED TO MERIT HIS PREFERENCE
THE SECOND DAY TWO OF THEIR SHEEP PLUNGED INTO A MORASS WHERE THEY AND THEIR BURDENS WERE LOST TWO MORE DIED OF FATIGUE A FEW DAYS AFTER SEVEN OR EIGHT PERISHED WITH HUNGER IN A DESERT
THERE MIGHT BE SAID POCOCURANTE IF ONLY ONE OF THOSE RAKERS OF RUBBISH HAD SHOWN HOW TO MAKE PINS
BOTH CASES HAVE HAPPENED TO ME THIS IS THE PRICE AT WHICH YOU EAT SUGAR IN EUROPE
THE POOR MAN HAD LOST HIS LEFT LEG AND HIS RIGHT HAND
IMMEDIATELY HE ACCOSTED THEM PRESENTED HIS COMPLIMENTS AND INVITED THEM TO HIS INN TO EAT SOME MACARONI WITH LOMBARD PARTRIDGES AND CAVIARE AND TO DRINK SOME MONTEPULCIANO
THAT SHE DIED TWO HOURS AFTER IN MOST HORRID CONVULSIONS THE WIFE'S RELATIONS PROSECUTED THE HUSBAND HE TOOK FLIGHT AND I WAS THROWN INTO JAIL MY INNOCENCE WOULD NOT HAVE SAVED ME IF I HAD NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING
AT LENGTH ONE LET OFF A BROADSIDE SO LOW AND SO TRULY AIMED THAT THE OTHER SANK TO THE BOTTOM
OUR TRAVELLERS SPENT THE FIRST DAY VERY AGREEABLY THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH POSSESSING MORE TREASURE THAN ALL ASIA EUROPE AND AFRICA COULD SCRAPE TOGETHER
TOWARDS THE LATTER END OF A REPAST HE INCLINED TO PANGLOSS'S DOCTRINE BUT YOU MISTER MARTIN SAID HE TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL THIS WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS ON MORAL AND NATURAL EVIL
THE IMMENSE PLUNDER WHICH THIS VILLAIN HAD AMASSED WAS BURIED WITH HIM IN THE SEA AND OUT OF THE WHOLE ONLY ONE SHEEP WAS SAVED YOU SEE SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN THAT CRIME IS SOMETIMES PUNISHED
SHE LOOKED AMOROUSLY AT HER THEATIN AND FROM TIME TO TIME PINCHED HIS FAT CHEEKS AT LEAST YOU WILL ALLOW ME SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN THAT THESE TWO ARE HAPPY
LET WHO WILL GO TO SEE BAD TRAGEDIES SET TO MUSIC WHERE THE SCENES ARE CONTRIVED FOR NO OTHER END THAN TO INTRODUCE TWO OR THREE SONGS RIDICULOUSLY OUT OF PLACE TO SHOW OFF AN ACTRESS'S VOICE LET WHO WILL OR WHO CAN
I HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE FRIGHTFUL DISASTERS THAT BEFELL THE FAMILY OF MY LADY BARONESS
I AM ONE SAID MARTIN I CANNOT HELP IT I KNOW NOT HOW TO THINK OTHERWISE
I HAVE READ WITH MUCH DISTASTE HIS INDELICATE VERSES AGAINST OLD WOMEN AND WITCHES NOR DO I SEE ANY MERIT IN TELLING HIS FRIEND MAECENAS THAT IF HE WILL BUT RANK HIM IN THE CHOIR OF LYRIC POETS HIS LOFTY HEAD SHALL TOUCH THE STARS
NAY HE WAS PROOF AGAINST THE TEMPTATIONS OF ALL THE LADIES YOU ARE IN TRUTH VERY SIMPLE SAID MARTIN TO HIM IF YOU IMAGINE THAT A MONGREL VALET WHO HAS FIVE OR SIX MILLIONS IN HIS POCKET
FIRST OF ALL LET HIM PAY DOWN THE THIRTY THOUSAND PIASTRES THEN WE SHALL SEE CANDIDE SOLD TWO SMALL DIAMONDS THE LEAST OF WHICH WAS WORTH MORE THAN WHAT THE SKIPPER ASKED FOR HIS FREIGHT HE PAID HIM IN ADVANCE
WHO OFFERED TO AGREE WITH THEM UPON REASONABLE TERMS HE APPOINTED TO MEET THEM AT A PUBLIC HOUSE
THE TWO SHEEP WERE PUT ON BOARD CANDIDE FOLLOWED IN A LITTLE BOAT TO JOIN THE VESSEL IN THE ROADS THE SKIPPER SEIZED HIS OPPORTUNITY SET SAIL AND PUT OUT TO SEA THE WIND FAVOURING HIM
REPRESENTS THE DEVILS CANNONADING IN HEAVEN NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN IN ITALY COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN THOSE MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCES AND THE MARRIAGE OF SIN AND DEATH AND THE SNAKES BROUGHT FORTH BY SIN
THIS PANGLOSS SAID HE WOULD BE PUZZLED TO DEMONSTRATE HIS SYSTEM I WISH THAT HE WERE HERE CERTAINLY IF ALL THINGS ARE GOOD IT IS IN EL DORADO AND NOT IN THE REST OF THE WORLD
THE VISIT TO LORD POCOCURANTE A NOBLE VENETIAN
IF HE FIND HER HE WILL KEEP HER TO HIMSELF IF HE DO NOT FIND HER HE WILL GET ANOTHER I ADVISE YOU TO FORGET YOUR VALET CACAMBO AND YOUR MISTRESS CUNEGONDE MARTIN WAS NOT CONSOLING CANDIDE'S MELANCHOLY INCREASED
THE JUDGE SET ME FREE ON CONDITION THAT HE SUCCEEDED THE SURGEON
A MILLION REGIMENTED ASSASSINS FROM ONE EXTREMITY OF EUROPE TO THE OTHER GET THEIR BREAD BY DISCIPLINED DEPREDATION AND MURDER FOR WANT OF MORE HONEST EMPLOYMENT EVEN IN THOSE CITIES WHICH SEEM TO ENJOY PEACE
BUT THAT CONTINUAL REPETITION OF BATTLES SO EXTREMELY LIKE ONE ANOTHER THOSE GODS THAT ARE ALWAYS ACTIVE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING DECISIVE THAT HELEN WHO IS THE CAUSE OF THE WAR
AND OBLIGED TO CONTINUE THIS ABOMINABLE TRADE WHICH APPEARS SO PLEASANT TO YOU MEN WHILE TO US WOMEN IT IS THE UTMOST ABYSS OF MISERY I HAVE COME TO EXERCISE THE PROFESSION AT VENICE
OH OH SAID THE DUTCH SKIPPER ONCE MORE TO HIMSELF THIRTY THOUSAND PIASTRES ARE A TRIFLE TO THIS MAN SURELY THESE SHEEP MUST BE LADEN WITH AN IMMENSE TREASURE LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
THOU HADST NOT GUESSED AT THIS ABOMINATION IT IS THE END I MUST AT LAST RENOUNCE THY OPTIMISM WHAT IS THIS OPTIMISM SAID CACAMBO
I GRANT ALL YOU SAY SAID CACAMBO BUT WE HAVE STILL TWO SHEEP REMAINING WITH MORE TREASURE THAN THE KING OF SPAIN WILL EVER HAVE
MY FRIEND YOU SEE HOW PERISHABLE ARE THE RICHES OF THIS WORLD THERE IS NOTHING SOLID BUT VIRTUE
HOLDING A GIRL ON HIS ARM THE THEATIN LOOKED FRESH COLOURED PLUMP AND VIGOROUS HIS EYES WERE SPARKLING HIS AIR ASSURED HIS LOOK LOFTY AND HIS STEP BOLD THE GIRL WAS VERY PRETTY AND SANG
CACAMBO APPLAUDED THIS WISE RESOLUTION HE DESPAIRED AT PARTING FROM SO GOOD A MASTER WHO HAD BECOME HIS INTIMATE FRIEND BUT THE PLEASURE OF SERVING HIM PREVAILED OVER THE PAIN OF LEAVING HIM THEY EMBRACED WITH TEARS
AT LENGTH HE MADE CHOICE OF A POOR MAN OF LETTERS WHO HAD WORKED TEN YEARS FOR THE BOOKSELLERS OF AMSTERDAM HE JUDGED THAT THERE WAS NOT IN THE WHOLE WORLD A TRADE WHICH COULD DISGUST ONE MORE
AND WHO WHILE MOSES REPRESENTS THE ETERNAL PRODUCING THE WORLD BY A WORD MAKES THE MESSIAH TAKE A GREAT PAIR OF COMPASSES FROM THE ARMOURY OF HEAVEN TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS WORK HOW CAN I HAVE ANY ESTEEM FOR A WRITER WHO HAS SPOILED TASSO'S HELL AND THE DEVIL
UPON CONDITION THAT THIS MAN WAS THE MOST DISSATISFIED WITH HIS STATE AND THE MOST UNFORTUNATE IN THE WHOLE PROVINCE SUCH A CROWD OF CANDIDATES PRESENTED THEMSELVES THAT A FLEET OF SHIPS COULD HARDLY HAVE HELD THEM
IMPOSSIBLE TO TREAT ONE'S RELATIONS IN A MORE BARBAROUS MANNER
I GRANT SAID THE SENATOR
YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT MY DEAR MARTIN ALL IS MISERY AND ILLUSION HE FELL INTO A DEEP MELANCHOLY AND NEITHER WENT TO SEE THE OPERA NOR ANY OF THE OTHER DIVERSIONS OF THE CARNIVAL
I SWEAR TO YOU THAT MY FATE HAS BEEN SCARCELY LESS SAD I WAS VERY INNOCENT WHEN YOU KNEW ME A GREY FRIAR WHO WAS MY CONFESSOR EASILY SEDUCED ME THE CONSEQUENCES WERE TERRIBLE
DECLARE EVERY SUNDAY THAT WE ARE ALL OF US CHILDREN OF ADAM BLACKS AS WELL AS WHITES I AM NOT A GENEALOGIST BUT IF THESE PREACHERS TELL TRUTH WE ARE ALL SECOND COUSINS
WHICH PUT CANDIDE A LITTLE OUT OF COUNTENANCE BUT WAS NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO MARTIN FIRST TWO PRETTY GIRLS VERY NEATLY DRESSED SERVED THEM WITH CHOCOLATE WHICH WAS FROTHED EXCEEDINGLY WELL
HERE IS THE GREAT MAN WHOM I FANCY YOU ARE NEVER TIRED OF READING I NEVER READ HIM REPLIED THE VENETIAN WHAT IS IT TO ME WHETHER HE PLEADS FOR RABIRIUS OR CLUENTIUS I TRY CAUSES ENOUGH MYSELF
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AT SURINAM
CANDIDE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM COMMENDING THEIR BEAUTY GRACE AND ADDRESS THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH CREATURES SAID THE SENATOR I MAKE THEM LIE WITH ME SOMETIMES FOR I AM VERY TIRED OF THE LADIES OF THE TOWN OF THEIR COQUETRIES
AND FLUNG HIM INTO A DEEP MELANCHOLY THE VILLAINY OF MANKIND PRESENTED ITSELF BEFORE HIS IMAGINATION IN ALL ITS DEFORMITY AND HIS MIND WAS FILLED WITH GLOOMY IDEAS AT LENGTH HEARING THAT A FRENCH VESSEL WAS READY TO SET SAIL FOR BORDEAUX
OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM BUT AFTER ALL THESE TWO GIRLS BEGIN TO WEARY ME
AND TO HAVE IN PROSPECT ONLY A FRIGHTFUL OLD AGE A HOSPITAL AND A DUNG HILL
PROMISING TO CHOOSE HIM WHO APPEARED TO BE MOST JUSTLY DISCONTENTED WITH HIS STATE AND TO BESTOW SOME PRESENTS UPON THE REST THEY SAT UNTIL FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
BUT I CARE LITTLE FOR HIS JOURNEY TO BRUNDUSIUM AND HIS ACCOUNT OF A BAD DINNER OR OF HIS LOW QUARREL BETWEEN ONE RUPILIUS WHOSE WORDS HE SAYS WERE FULL OF POISONOUS FILTH AND ANOTHER WHOSE LANGUAGE WAS IMBUED WITH VINEGAR
THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL WELL SAID CANDIDE I FIND THAT I SHALL BE THE ONLY HAPPY MAN WHEN I AM BLESSED WITH THE SIGHT OF MY DEAR CUNEGONDE IT IS ALWAYS WELL TO HOPE SAID MARTIN
THE GARDENS LAID OUT WITH TASTE WERE ADORNED WITH FINE MARBLE STATUES THE PALACE WAS BEAUTIFULLY BUILT THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN OF SIXTY AND VERY RICH HE RECEIVED THE TWO TRAVELLERS WITH POLITE INDIFFERENCE
FOOLS ADMIRE EVERYTHING IN AN AUTHOR OF REPUTATION FOR MY PART I READ ONLY TO PLEASE MYSELF I LIKE ONLY THAT WHICH SERVES MY PURPOSE
INSTEAD OF HER I HAVE ONLY MET A PARISIAN WENCH AND A PERIGORDIAN ABBE CUNEGONDE IS DEAD WITHOUT DOUBT AND THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME BUT TO DIE ALAS HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR ME TO HAVE REMAINED IN THE PARADISE OF EL DORADO
WE ARE AT THE END OF ALL OUR TROUBLES AND AT THE BEGINNING OF HAPPINESS AS THEY DREW NEAR THE TOWN THEY SAW A NEGRO STRETCHED UPON THE GROUND WITH ONLY ONE MOIETY OF HIS CLOTHES THAT IS OF HIS BLUE LINEN DRAWERS
THE GIRL BLUSHED
JEALOUSY DISCORD AND FURY DWELL IN THE CONVENT IT IS TRUE I HAVE PREACHED A FEW BAD SERMONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ME IN A LITTLE MONEY OF WHICH THE PRIOR STOLE HALF WHILE THE REST SERVES TO MAINTAIN MY GIRLS
I SEE THAT WE OFTEN MEET WITH THOSE WHOM WE EXPECTED NEVER TO SEE MORE SO THAT PERHAPS AS I HAVE FOUND MY RED SHEEP AND PAQUETTE IT MAY WELL BE THAT I SHALL ALSO FIND CUNEGONDE
THERE SAID HE IS A BOOK THAT WAS ONCE THE DELIGHT OF THE GREAT PANGLOSS THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN GERMANY IT IS NOT MINE ANSWERED POCOCURANTE COOLLY THEY USED AT ONE TIME TO MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT I TOOK A PLEASURE IN READING HIM
AND OTHERS SUBSEQUENTLY FELL DOWN PRECIPICES AT LENGTH AFTER TRAVELLING A HUNDRED DAYS ONLY TWO SHEEP REMAINED
I WAS OBLIGED TO QUIT THE CASTLE SOME TIME AFTER THE BARON HAD SENT YOU AWAY WITH KICKS ON THE BACKSIDE IF A FAMOUS SURGEON HAD NOT TAKEN COMPASSION ON ME I SHOULD HAVE DIED FOR SOME TIME I WAS THIS SURGEON'S MISTRESS MERELY OUT OF GRATITUDE
TO BE OFTEN REDUCED TO BORROWING A PETTICOAT ONLY TO GO AND HAVE IT RAISED BY A DISAGREEABLE MAN TO BE ROBBED BY ONE OF WHAT ONE HAS EARNED FROM ANOTHER TO BE SUBJECT TO THE EXTORTIONS OF THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE
IF THE GOVERNOR MAKES ANY DIFFICULTY GIVE HIM A MILLION IF HE WILL NOT RELINQUISH HER GIVE HIM TWO AS YOU HAVE NOT KILLED AN INQUISITOR THEY WILL HAVE NO SUSPICION OF YOU I'LL GET ANOTHER SHIP AND GO AND WAIT FOR YOU AT VENICE THAT'S A FREE COUNTRY
I'LL ANSWER FOR IT SAID HE THAT WITH THIS THEY WILL BE HAPPY
I HAVE A GREAT MANY PICTURES BUT I PRIZE THEM VERY LITTLE WHILE THEY WERE WAITING FOR DINNER POCOCURANTE ORDERED A CONCERT
UPON HIS LIPS TOLD THE SPANIARD ALL HIS ADVENTURES
I HAVE A NOTION SAID HE THAT A REPUBLICAN MUST BE GREATLY PLEASED WITH MOST OF THESE BOOKS WHICH ARE WRITTEN WITH A SPIRIT OF FREEDOM YES ANSWERED POCOCURANTE IT IS NOBLE TO WRITE AS ONE THINKS THIS IS THE PRIVILEGE OF HUMANITY
HE HAD INDEED ENDURED MISFORTUNES A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE
I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
ALAS SAID HE THIS IS A TRICK WORTHY OF THE OLD WORLD HE PUT BACK OVERWHELMED WITH SORROW FOR INDEED HE HAD LOST SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THE FORTUNE OF TWENTY MONARCHS HE WAITED UPON THE DUTCH MAGISTRATE
BUT WHEN I RETURN AT NIGHT TO THE MONASTERY I AM READY TO DASH MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALLS OF THE DORMITORY AND ALL MY FELLOWS ARE IN THE SAME CASE
WAS MUCH SURPRISED AT WHAT HE HEARD MARTIN FOUND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF REASON IN POCOCURANTE'S REMARKS
I HAVE LIVED SAID MARTIN
THOUGH THE KNAVERY OF THE DUTCH SKIPPER STILL SAT HEAVY UPON HIS MIND YET WHEN HE REFLECTED UPON WHAT HE HAD STILL LEFT
CANDIDE WAS MORE REJOICED AT THE RECOVERY OF THIS ONE SHEEP THAN HE HAD BEEN GRIEVED AT THE LOSS OF THE HUNDRED LADEN WITH THE LARGE DIAMONDS OF EL DORADO
THE FRENCH AND SPANISH SHIPS CONTINUED THEIR COURSE AND CANDIDE CONTINUED HIS CONVERSATION WITH MARTIN THEY DISPUTED FIFTEEN SUCCESSIVE DAYS AND ON THE LAST OF THOSE FIFTEEN DAYS THEY WERE AS FAR ADVANCED AS ON THE FIRST
YES SIR SAID THE NEGRO IT IS THE CUSTOM THEY GIVE US A PAIR OF LINEN DRAWERS FOR OUR WHOLE GARMENT TWICE A YEAR WHEN WE WORK AT THE SUGAR CANES AND THE MILL SNATCHES HOLD OF A FINGER
ALAS I KNOW NOT WHETHER I HAVE MADE THEIR FORTUNES THIS I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE NOT MADE MINE DOGS MONKEYS AND PARROTS ARE A THOUSAND TIMES LESS WRETCHED THAN I THE DUTCH FETICHES WHO HAVE CONVERTED ME
I HAVE SEEN SO MUCH AND EXPERIENCED SO MUCH THAT I AM A MANICHEAN
THIS PHILOSOPHER WAS AN HONEST MAN BUT HE HAD BEEN ROBBED BY HIS WIFE BEATEN BY HIS SON AND ABANDONED BY HIS DAUGHTER WHO GOT A PORTUGUESE TO RUN AWAY WITH HER HE HAD JUST BEEN DEPRIVED OF A SMALL EMPLOYMENT ON WHICH HE SUBSISTED
AY SAID THE SKIPPER TO HIMSELF THIS MAN AGREES TO PAY TWENTY THOUSAND PIASTRES WITH AS MUCH EASE AS TEN HE WENT BACK TO HIM AGAIN AND DECLARED THAT HE COULD NOT CARRY HIM TO VENICE FOR LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PIASTRES
AND IN HIS DISTRESS HE KNOCKED OVER LOUDLY AT THE DOOR
HE IS SO DEEPLY CONCERNED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE MAY VERY WELL BE IN ME AS WELL AS IN EVERYBODY ELSE
THEY HAD BOTH SEEN AND SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL
WAS REMINDED OF WHAT THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID TO HIM IN THEIR VOYAGE TO BUENOS AYRES AND OF HER WAGER THAT THERE WAS NOT A PERSON ON BOARD THE SHIP BUT HAD MET WITH VERY GREAT MISFORTUNES HE DREAMED OF PANGLOSS AT EVERY ADVENTURE TOLD TO HIM
THERE ARE MAXIMS IN THIS WRITER ANSWERED POCOCURANTE FROM WHICH A MAN OF THE WORLD MAY REAP GREAT BENEFIT AND BEING WRITTEN IN ENERGETIC VERSE THEY ARE MORE EASILY IMPRESSED UPON THE MEMORY
OH OH SAID THE PRUDENT VANDERDENDUR TO HIMSELF THIS STRANGER GIVES TEN THOUSAND PIASTRES UNHESITATINGLY HE MUST BE VERY RICH RETURNING A LITTLE WHILE AFTER
HIS INSIPID LAVINIA I THINK THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE FLAT AND DISAGREEABLE I PREFER TASSO A GOOD DEAL OR EVEN THE SOPORIFIC TALES OF ARIOSTO
BUT HOWEVER THEY CHATTED THEY COMMUNICATED IDEAS THEY CONSOLED EACH OTHER
I KNOW OF NOTHING IN SO BAD A TASTE SAID THE MASTER ALL YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY TRIFLING AFTER TO MORROW I WILL HAVE IT PLANTED WITH A NOBLER DESIGN
THAT MAY BE SAID MARTIN BUT I KNOW THEM NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DISPUTE THEY HEARD THE REPORT OF CANNON IT REDOUBLED EVERY INSTANT EACH TOOK OUT HIS GLASS
THE FRENCH CAPTAIN SOON SAW THAT THE CAPTAIN OF THE VICTORIOUS VESSEL WAS A SPANIARD AND THAT THE OTHER WAS A DUTCH PIRATE
THEY SAW TWO SHIPS IN CLOSE FIGHT ABOUT THREE MILES OFF THE WIND BROUGHT BOTH SO NEAR TO THE FRENCH VESSEL THAT OUR TRAVELLERS HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE FIGHT AT THEIR EASE
THIS ROGUE OF A DUTCH SKIPPER HAS MET WITH THE FATE HE DESERVED YES SAID MARTIN BUT WHY SHOULD THE PASSENGERS BE DOOMED ALSO TO DESTRUCTION GOD HAS PUNISHED THE KNAVE AND THE DEVIL HAS DROWNED THE REST
BUT WITH DISCRETION MARTIN WAS ENTIRELY OF THE SENATOR'S OPINION THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE AND AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES
AND AMONG ALL THE LADIES OF PLEASURE BUT TO NO PURPOSE HE SENT EVERY DAY TO INQUIRE ON ALL THE SHIPS THAT CAME IN BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS OF CACAMBO WHAT SAID HE TO MARTIN I HAVE HAD TIME TO VOYAGE FROM SURINAM TO BORDEAUX
AND I ONLY TREAT IT NOW AS IT WAS TREATED IN ITS OWN COUNTRY BY CONTEMPORARIES FOR THE MATTER OF THAT I SAY WHAT I THINK AND I CARE VERY LITTLE WHETHER OTHERS THINK AS I DO
I HAVE SOMETIMES ASKED LEARNED MEN WHETHER THEY WERE NOT AS WEARY AS I OF THAT WORK THOSE WHO WERE SINCERE HAVE OWNED TO ME THAT THE POEM MADE THEM FALL ASLEEP YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY
ASKED WHETHER HE DID NOT LOOK UPON THIS AUTHOR AS A GREAT MAN WHO SAID POCOCURANTE THAT BARBARIAN WHO WRITES A LONG COMMENTARY IN TEN BOOKS OF HARSH VERSE ON THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS
PLATO OBSERVED A LONG WHILE AGO THAT THOSE STOMACHS ARE NOT THE BEST THAT REJECT ALL SORTS OF FOOD
DIE AWAY WITH PLEASURE AT THE SIGHT OF AN EUNUCH QUAVERING THE ROLE OF CAESAR OR OF CATO AND STRUTTING AWKWARDLY UPON THE STAGE FOR MY PART I HAVE LONG SINCE RENOUNCED THOSE PALTRY ENTERTAINMENTS
WHILE SPEAKING HE SAW HE KNEW NOT WHAT OF A SHINING RED SWIMMING CLOSE TO THE VESSEL THEY PUT OUT THE LONG BOAT TO SEE WHAT IT COULD BE IT WAS ONE OF HIS SHEEP
HE WEPT FOR A LONG WHILE AT LAST HE DREW CACAMBO ASIDE HERE MY DEAR FRIEND SAID HE TO HIM THIS THOU MUST DO WE HAVE EACH OF US IN HIS POCKET FIVE OR SIX MILLIONS IN DIAMONDS
WHO SAID TO HIS FRIEND YOU SEE THAT ALREADY I HAVE WON HALF THE WAGER
HIS WIFE WHO WAS MAD WITH JEALOUSY BEAT ME EVERY DAY UNMERCIFULLY SHE WAS A FURY THE SURGEON WAS ONE OF THE UGLIEST OF MEN
AND WHERE THE ARTS FLOURISH THE INHABITANTS ARE DEVOURED BY MORE ENVY CARE AND UNEASINESS THAN ARE EXPERIENCED BY A BESIEGED TOWN SECRET GRIEFS ARE MORE CRUEL THAN PUBLIC CALAMITIES IN A WORD
I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT GOD HAS ABANDONED IT TO SOME MALIGNANT BEING I EXCEPT ALWAYS EL DORADO I SCARCELY EVER KNEW A CITY THAT DID NOT DESIRE THE DESTRUCTION OF A NEIGHBOURING CITY
AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY YOU MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY ONE ELSE EVER OPENS THEM MARTIN SAW SOME SHELVES FILLED WITH ENGLISH BOOKS
YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
BY THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE THE SUBJECT OF MORAL AND NATURAL EVIL WOULD HAVE ENABLED THEM TO ENTERTAIN ONE ANOTHER DURING THE WHOLE VOYAGE CANDIDE HOWEVER HAD ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER MARTIN
WHO TOOK HIM FOR A SOCINIAN WE MUST ALLOW THAT THE OTHERS WERE AT LEAST AS WRETCHED AS HE
TO COAST ALONG PORTUGAL AND SPAIN TO CROSS THE WHOLE MEDITERRANEAN
ARE THEY NOT PERPETUALLY SINGING YOU DO NOT SEE THEM SAID MARTIN AT HOME WITH THEIR WIVES AND BRATS THE DOGE HAS HIS TROUBLES THE GONDOLIERS HAVE THEIRS
I WISH THAT ALL THE THEATINS WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED A HUNDRED TIMES TO SET FIRE TO THE CONVENT AND GO AND BECOME A TURK MY PARENTS FORCED ME AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN TO PUT ON THIS DETESTABLE HABIT
AFTER HE HAD HIRED DOMESTICS AND PURCHASED EVERYTHING NECESSARY FOR A LONG VOYAGE
THEY RAISED THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN AND UTTERED TERRIBLE OUTCRIES AND THE NEXT MOMENT WERE SWALLOWED UP BY THE SEA WELL SAID MARTIN THIS IS HOW MEN TREAT ONE ANOTHER
WHO LIVES IN THAT FINE PALACE ON THE BRENTA WHERE HE ENTERTAINS FOREIGNERS IN THE POLITEST MANNER THEY PRETEND THAT THIS MAN HAS NEVER FELT ANY UNEASINESS
AND MARTIN CONTINUED TO PROVE TO HIM THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE VIRTUE OR HAPPINESS UPON EARTH EXCEPT PERHAPS IN EL DORADO WHERE NOBODY COULD GAIN ADMITTANCE WHILE THEY WERE DISPUTING ON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT
I SHOULD BE HANGED AND SO WOULD YOU THE FAIR CUNEGONDE IS MY LORD'S FAVOURITE MISTRESS
THEN HE LISTENED PATIENTLY PROMISED TO EXAMINE INTO HIS AFFAIR AT THE SKIPPER'S RETURN AND ORDERED HIM TO PAY TEN THOUSAND PIASTRES FOR THE EXPENSE OF THE HEARING
MY DEAR CHILD BLESS OUR FETICHES ADORE THEM FOR EVER THEY WILL MAKE THEE LIVE HAPPILY THOU HAST THE HONOUR OF BEING THE SLAVE OF OUR LORDS THE WHITES WHICH IS MAKING THE FORTUNE OF THY FATHER AND MOTHER
ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER THIS OBSCURE WHIMSICAL AND DISAGREEABLE POEM WAS DESPISED UPON ITS FIRST PUBLICATION
HE LET HIM KNOW THAT UPON SECOND CONSIDERATION HE COULD NOT UNDERTAKE THE VOYAGE FOR LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PIASTRES
THIS NOISE SAID THE SENATOR MAY AMUSE ONE FOR HALF AN HOUR BUT IF IT WERE TO LAST LONGER IT WOULD GROW TIRESOME TO EVERYBODY THOUGH THEY DURST NOT OWN IT MUSIC TO DAY IS ONLY THE ART OF EXECUTING DIFFICULT THINGS
WHAT ART THOU DOING THERE FRIEND IN THAT SHOCKING CONDITION I AM WAITING FOR MY MASTER MYNHEER VANDERDENDUR THE FAMOUS MERCHANT ANSWERED THE NEGRO
AS HE HAD NO SHEEP LADEN WITH DIAMONDS TO TAKE ALONG WITH HIM HE HIRED A CABIN AT THE USUAL PRICE HE MADE IT KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE WOULD PAY THE PASSAGE AND BOARD AND GIVE TWO THOUSAND PIASTRES TO ANY HONEST MAN WHO WOULD MAKE THE VOYAGE WITH HIM
I WISH SAID MARTIN SHE MAY ONE DAY MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY BUT I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH
THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE WITH PAQUETTE AND THE THEATIN THE REPAST WAS ENTERTAINING AND TOWARDS THE END THEY CONVERSED WITH ALL CONFIDENCE
THERE WAS A LITTLE SILENCE ONE ADMITS THAT THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SUFFRAGE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG SAID A GIRL OPPOSITE LEANING FORWARD AND CRUMBLING HER BREAD ARE THEY
ONLY THAT WOULD BE A JOKE AND I KNOW I SHOULD SPOIL IT VERY NEAR THOUGH MURMURED THE CARRIER WITH A CHUCKLE VERY NEAR THE STRANGER
SAID TIBBY FAINTLY AND LEANT SO FAR BACK IN HIS CHAIR THAT HE EXTENDED IN A HORIZONTAL LINE FROM KNEES TO THROAT AND DON'T THINK I'M NOT SERIOUS BECAUSE I DON'T USE THE TRADITIONAL ARGUMENTS
AND NOT TILL THE MEAL WAS HALF OVER DID THEY REALIZE THAT THE PRINCIPAL GUEST HAD TAKEN NO PART IN THE CHASE THERE WAS NO COMMON TOPIC MISSUS WILCOX WHOSE LIFE HAD BEEN SPENT IN THE SERVICE OF HUSBAND AND SONS
SHE HAD HEARD HIM EXPOSE SOCIALISM BUT TRUE INSIGHT BEGAN JUST WHERE HIS INTELLIGENCE ENDED AND ONE GATHERED THAT THIS WAS THE CASE WITH MOST MILLIONAIRES WHAT RIGHT HAD SUCH MEN BUT MARGARET CHECKED HERSELF
BUT THE DEMON OF VOCIFERATION WAS IN HER AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS OFF AGAIN ONLY ON TUESDAY FOR THEY LIVE RIGHT AWAY AT STETTIN
FOR THAT GOOD DOG MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN HIS MASTER HAD IT SEEMED BEEN WATCHING THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS SLEEP LEST HE SHOULD WALK OFF WITH A FEW YOUNG POPLAR TREES THAT WERE TIED UP BEHIND THE CART
GOOD EVENING TILLY GOOD EVENING UNBEKNOWN HOW'S BABY MUM BOXER'S PRETTY WELL I HOPE ALL THRIVING CALEB REPLIED DOT
RETORTED HELEN AND THAT TOPIC WAS RESUMED BUT WITH ACRIMONY THEN TEA CAME AND AFTER TEA HELEN WENT ON PREPARING HER SPEECH AND MARGARET PREPARED ONE TOO FOR THEY WERE GOING OUT TO A DISCUSSION SOCIETY ON THE MORROW
THAT SHE CERTAINLY DID NOT FEEL SHE HAD KEPT HOUSE FOR OVER TEN YEARS SHE HAD ENTERTAINED ALMOST WITH DISTINCTION SHE HAD BROUGHT UP A CHARMING SISTER AND WAS BRINGING UP A BROTHER SURELY IF EXPERIENCE IS ATTAINABLE SHE HAD ATTAINED IT
MARGARET WAS NOT SHOCKED BUT WENT ON SEWING FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SHE REPLIED
YOUR LAST SPEECH INTERESTED ME SO MUCH GENERALLY PEOPLE DO NOT
MAKING MONEY A SPHERE AWAITING YOU AND SO ON ALL OF WHICH ARE FOR VARIOUS REASONS CANT SHE SEWED ON I'M ONLY YOUR SISTER I HAVEN'T ANY AUTHORITY OVER YOU AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY JUST TO PUT BEFORE YOU
HER HOSTESS WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN PLACING ROTHENSTEIN TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WAS REPEATED I HOPE THAT YOUR SISTER IS SAFE IN GERMANY BY NOW MARGARET CHECKED HERSELF AND SAID YES THANK YOU I HEARD ON TUESDAY
WAS VERY READY TO OBLIGE THE WHOLE PARTY BY CONSENTING TO A PROLONGATION OF HER STAY AND IN THE COURSE OF TWO MONTHS CEASED TO WRITE OF HER ABSENCE AND IN THE COURSE OF TWO OR MORE TO WRITE TO HER AT ALL
SHE HAD A FACE LIKE A SILKWORM AND THE DINING ROOM REEKS OF ORRIS ROOT WE CHATTED PLEASANTLY A LITTLE ABOUT HUSBANDS AND I WONDERED WHERE HERS WAS TOO AND ADVISED HER TO GO TO THE POLICE SHE THANKED ME
I AM NOT SURE THAT I AGREE DO YOU SAID HE TURNING TO MISSUS WILCOX SHE REPLIED I THINK MISS SCHLEGEL PUTS EVERYTHING SPLENDIDLY
OUT TO HIS DUTY DUTY ALWAYS ELICITED A GROAN HE DOESN'T WANT THE MONEY IT IS WORK HE WANTS THOUGH IT IS BEASTLY WORK DULL COUNTRY DISHONEST NATIVES AN ETERNAL FIDGET OVER FRESH WATER AND FOOD
NOT ANYONE POMPOUS OR TEARFUL WERE CARING FOR US UP IN THE SKY THE LONDONER SELDOM UNDERSTANDS HIS CITY UNTIL IT SWEEPS HIM TOO AWAY FROM HIS MOORINGS
WAS THERE SUCH A THING AS STETTININITY MARGARET SWEPT ON PEOPLE AT STETTIN DROP THINGS INTO BOATS OUT OF OVERHANGING WAREHOUSES
CONCERTS AND PLAYS SWEPT PAST THEM MONEY HAD BEEN SPENT AND RENEWED REPUTATIONS WON AND LOST AND THE CITY HERSELF EMBLEMATIC OF THEIR LIVES ROSE AND FELL IN A CONTINUAL FLUX
THE PART BY THE LANDING STAGE IS IN B MINOR IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY BUT LOWER DOWN THINGS GET EXTREMELY MIXED THERE IS A SLODGY THEME IN SEVERAL KEYS AT ONCE MEANING MUD BANKS AND ANOTHER FOR THE NAVIGABLE CANAL AND THE EXIT INTO THE BALTIC IS IN C
CONCLUDED BY DECLINING ENTIRELY TO PROFIT BY SUCH UNEXAMPLED ATTENTION MISSUS VERNON PERSEVERED HOWEVER IN THE OFFER OF IT AND THOUGH LADY SUSAN CONTINUED TO RESIST HER RESISTANCE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS SEEMED
IT HAD SEEN SO MUCH HAPPINESS WHY HAD IT TO BE SWEPT AWAY IN THE STREETS OF THE CITY SHE NOTED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE ARCHITECTURE OF HURRY AND HEARD THE LANGUAGE OF HURRY ON THE MOUTHS OF ITS INHABITANTS
YET SHE AND DAILY LIFE WERE OUT OF FOCUS ONE OR THE OTHER MUST SHOW BLURRED AND AT LUNCH SHE SEEMED MORE OUT OF FOCUS THAN USUAL AND NEARER THE LINE THAT DIVIDES LIFE FROM A LIFE THAT MAY BE OF GREATER IMPORTANCE
BEFORE HE COULD HAVE READ TWO LINES HE AGAIN INTERRUPTED HIMSELF TO SAY BABY YOURS
AND DARK BRIGHT PENETRATING EYES LOOKED ROUND WITH A SMILE AND SALUTED THE CARRIER'S WIFE BY GRAVELY INCLINING HIS HEAD HIS GARB WAS VERY QUAINT AND ODD A LONG LONG WAY BEHIND THE TIME ITS HUE WAS BROWN ALL OVER
FOR THE FORMER SOON PERCEIVED BY THE STYLE OF FREDERICA'S LETTERS THAT THEY WERE WRITTEN UNDER HER MOTHER'S INSPECTION AND THEREFORE DEFERRING ALL PARTICULAR ENQUIRY TILL SHE COULD MAKE IT PERSONALLY IN LONDON CEASED WRITING MINUTELY
ROUSE UP THAT'S MY HEARTY JOHN SAID THESE LATTER WORDS OUTSIDE THE DOOR WHITHER HE HAD HURRIED WITH THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND MISS SLOWBOY CONSCIOUS OF SOME MYSTERIOUS REFERENCE TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND CONNECTING IN HER MYSTIFIED IMAGINATION
CERTAINLY LONDON FASCINATES ONE VISUALIZES IT AS A TRACT OF QUIVERING GREY INTELLIGENT WITHOUT PURPOSE AND EXCITABLE WITHOUT LOVE AS A SPIRIT THAT HAS ALTERED BEFORE IT CAN BE CHRONICLED
AND CONFIRMED HER IN THE PLAN OF ALTERING IT NO UNKINDNESS HOWEVER ON THE PART OF LADY SUSAN APPEARED PERSECUTION ON THE SUBJECT OF SIR JAMES WAS ENTIRELY AT AN END HIS NAME MERELY MENTIONED TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT IN LONDON
AS A HEART THAT CERTAINLY BEATS BUT WITH NO PULSATION OF HUMANITY IT LIES BEYOND EVERYTHING NATURE WITH ALL HER CRUELTY COMES NEARER TO US THAN DO THESE CROWDS OF MEN
MEN HAVE DEVELOPED THE DESIRE FOR WORK AND THEY MUST NOT STARVE IT IT'S A NEW DESIRE IT GOES WITH A GREAT DEAL THAT'S BAD BUT IN ITSELF IT'S GOOD AND I HOPE THAT FOR WOMEN TOO NOT TO WORK WILL SOON BECOME AS SHOCKING AS
NO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR NINNIES THEN THEY WERE MEN WHO HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO SAID HIS SISTER FEELING THAT SHE WAS ENTITLED TO SCORE THIS POINT SO TAKE WARNING YOU MUST WORK OR ELSE YOU MUST PRETEND TO WORK WHICH IS WHAT I DO
OH TO BE SURE SAID CALEB IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH CARE YES YES THAT'S MINE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITH CASH INDEED IF MY DEAR BOY IN THE GOLDEN SOUTH AMERICAS HAD LIVED JOHN YOU LOVED HIM LIKE A SON DIDN'T YOU
SOMEWHAT LESS FORMIDABLE THE LUCKY ALARM OF AN INFLUENZA DECIDED WHAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN DECIDED QUITE SO SOON LADY SUSAN'S MATERNAL FEARS WERE THEN TOO MUCH AWAKENED FOR HER TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT FREDERICA'S REMOVAL FROM THE RISK OF INFECTION
FOR WHEN HE TURNED TO SHUT THE DOOR AND KEEP THE WEATHER OUT HE DISCLOSED UPON THE BACK OF THAT GARMENT THE INSCRIPTION G AND T IN LARGE BLACK CAPITALS ALSO THE WORD GLASS IN BOLD CHARACTERS GOOD EVENING JOHN SAID THE LITTLE MAN
AND DWARFED THEIR ACTIVITIES THERE WAS NO BITTERNESS IN MISSUS WILCOX THERE WAS NOT EVEN CRITICISM SHE WAS LOVABLE AND NO UNGRACIOUS OR UNCHARITABLE WORD HAD PASSED HER LIPS
CALEB PLUMMER WITH CARE YES
TO BE LIKE MUSIC IT'S OBLIGED TO REMIND HER OF A SYMPHONIC POEM
MADE HER ALMOST TURN FROM HER WITH HORROR NO REMEMBRANCE OF REGINALD NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT GAVE ONE LOOK OF EMBARRASSMENT
LET ME SEE I THINK THAT'S ALL I THINK NOT SAID THE CARRIER TRY AGAIN
WHAT IT IS HE SNEERED WHAT IT IS WORSE LUCK I WANT ACTIVITY WITHOUT CIVILIZATION HOW PARADOXICAL YET I EXPECT THAT IS WHAT WE SHALL FIND IN HEAVEN AND I SAID TIBBY
THE CARRIER PUT HIS HAND INTO A POCKET OF THE COAT HE HAD TAKEN OFF AND BROUGHT OUT CAREFULLY PRESERVED IN MOSS AND PAPER A TINY FLOWER POT THERE IT IS HE SAID ADJUSTING IT WITH GREAT CARE
SHE WAS NOT INTELLECTUAL NOR EVEN ALERT AND IT WAS ODD THAT ALL THE SAME SHE SHOULD GIVE THE IDEA OF GREATNESS MARGARET ZIGZAGGING WITH HER FRIENDS OVER THOUGHT AND ART WAS CONSCIOUS OF A PERSONALITY THAT TRANSCENDED THEIR OWN
VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE TO THE STATE COULD BE DERIVED FROM THE EPISTOLARY INTERCOURSE OF MISSUS VERNON AND HER NIECE
AND I'M SURE I NEED ONLY LOOK AT YOU FOR ANOTHER SAID CALEB HE DIDN'T LOOK AT HER THOUGH HE HAD A WANDERING AND THOUGHTFUL EYE WHICH SEEMED TO BE ALWAYS PROJECTING ITSELF INTO SOME OTHER TIME AND PLACE NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID
HAS VERY LITTLE FAITH IN THE CONTINENT AND OUR CHILDREN HAVE ALL TAKEN AFTER HIM ON WHAT GROUNDS DO THEY FEEL THAT THE CONTINENT IS IN BAD FORM MISSUS WILCOX HAD NO IDEA SHE PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO GROUNDS
WAS DEFRAUDED OF HER DUE BY A WOMAN TEN YEARS OLDER
SOON FOUND SOME ACCOMMODATING BUSINESS TO CALL HIM THITHER WITH A HEART FULL OF THE MATTER MISSUS VERNON WAITED ON LADY SUSAN SHORTLY AFTER HER ARRIVAL IN TOWN AND WAS MET WITH SUCH AN EASY AND CHEERFUL AFFECTION AS
AND FINALLY DISMISSED HIM AS HAVING NO POSSIBLE BEARING ON THE SUBJECT UNDER DISCUSSION THAT BLEAT OF TIBBY'S INFURIATED HELEN BUT HELEN WAS NOW DOWN IN THE DINING ROOM PREPARING A SPEECH ABOUT POLITICAL ECONOMY AT TIMES HER VOICE COULD BE HEARD DECLAIMING THROUGH THE FLOOR
THE LEAVES WERE FALLING BY MIDSUMMER THE SUN SHONE THROUGH DIRT WITH AN ADMIRED OBSCURITY TO SPEAK AGAINST LONDON IS NO LONGER FASHIONABLE THE EARTH AS AN ARTISTIC CULT HAS HAD ITS DAY
CHAPTER NINE MISSUS WILCOX CANNOT BE ACCUSED OF GIVING MARGARET MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT LIFE AND MARGARET ON THE OTHER HAND HAS MADE A FAIR SHOW OF MODESTY AND HAS PRETENDED TO AN INEXPERIENCE
WHILE HER SHALLOWS WASHED MORE WIDELY AGAINST THE HILLS OF SURREY AND OVER THE FIELDS OF HERTFORDSHIRE THIS FAMOUS BUILDING HAD ARISEN THAT WAS DOOMED TODAY WHITEHALL HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED IT WOULD BE THE TURN OF REGENT STREET TOMORROW
NOT SO MUCH AS A LEAF DAMAGED FULL OF BUDS CALEB'S DULL EYE BRIGHTENED AS HE TOOK IT AND THANKED HIM DEAR CALEB SAID THE CARRIER VERY DEAR AT THIS SEASON
AND A CHILL FELL ON THE CONVERSATION OH MISSUS WILCOX SAY SOMETHING NICER THAN THAT IT'S SUCH A SNUB TO BE TOLD YOU PUT THINGS SPLENDIDLY I DO NOT MEAN IT AS A SNUB
OR OFTEN HAVING LEARNT ENOUGH IN THE MEANWHILE FROM HER OPEN HEARTED BROTHER OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND LADY SUSAN TO SINK THE LATTER LOWER THAN EVER IN HER OPINION
THREE MONTHS MIGHT HAVE DONE IT IN GENERAL BUT REGINALD'S FEELINGS WERE NO LESS LASTING THAN LIVELY WHETHER LADY SUSAN WAS OR WAS NOT HAPPY IN HER SECOND CHOICE I DO NOT SEE HOW IT CAN EVER BE ASCERTAINED
THE PARTICULAR MILLIONAIRE WHO OWNED THE FREEHOLD OF WICKHAM PLACE AND DESIRED TO ERECT BABYLONIAN FLATS UPON IT WHAT RIGHT HAD HE TO STIR SO LARGE A PORTION OF THE QUIVERING JELLY HE WAS NOT A FOOL
AND THE LITERATURE OF THE NEAR FUTURE WILL PROBABLY IGNORE THE COUNTRY AND SEEK INSPIRATION FROM THE TOWN ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THE REACTION OF PAN AND THE ELEMENTAL FORCES THE PUBLIC HAS HEARD A LITTLE TOO MUCH
NOT TO BE MARRIED WAS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE OF THIS PROFOUND DESIRE TO WHICH YOU ALLUDE ENUNCIATED TIBBY
HE NEVER STRIKES ME AS PARTICULARLY HAPPY
WAS SHE PRETTY HER FIGURE MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD ONCE THE FLATS THEIR ONLY OUTLOOK HUNG LIKE AN ORNATE CURTAIN BETWEEN MARGARET AND THE WELTER OF LONDON HER THOUGHTS TURNED SADLY TO HOUSE HUNTING
SAID THE LITTLE MAN SPELLING OUT THE DIRECTION WITH CASH WITH CASH JOHN I DON'T THINK IT'S FOR ME WITH CARE RETURNED THE CARRIER LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER WHERE DO YOU MAKE OUT CASH
AND SHE WAS A WISP OF HAY A FLOWER
ACKNOWLEDGING IN TERMS OF GRATEFUL DELIGHT THAT FREDERICA WAS NOW GROWING EVERY DAY MORE AND MORE WHAT A PARENT COULD DESIRE MISSUS VERNON SURPRIZED AND INCREDULOUS KNEW NOT WHAT TO SUSPECT
A NATION WHO CAN PRODUCE MEN OF THAT SORT MAY WELL BE PROUD NO WONDER ENGLAND HAS BECOME AN EMPIRE EMPIRE I CAN'T
OR LIVERPOOL STREET IN THE MORNING THE CITY INHALING OR THE SAME THOROUGHFARES IN THE EVENING THE CITY EXHALING HER EXHAUSTED AIR WE REACH IN DESPERATION BEYOND THE FOG BEYOND THE VERY STARS THE VOIDS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE RANSACKED TO JUSTIFY THE MONSTER
OH MISSUS WILCOX YOU WOULD LOVE THE ODER THE RIVER OR RATHER RIVERS THERE SEEM TO BE DOZENS OF THEM ARE INTENSE BLUE AND THE PLAIN THEY RUN THROUGH AN INTENSEST GREEN
WANT CIVILIZATION WITHOUT ACTIVITY WHICH I EXPECT IS WHAT WE SHALL FIND IN THE OTHER PLACE
WHAT I THINK THE TRUTH YOU SEE
I WISH IT WAS OR COULD BE CRIED THE CARRIER THANKEE SAID THE LITTLE MAN YOU SPEAK VERY HEARTY TO THINK THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER SEE THE DOLLS AND THEM A STARING AT HER SO BOLD ALL DAY LONG
IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GREAT BROWN CLUB OR WALKING STICK AND STRIKING THIS UPON THE FLOOR IT FELL ASUNDER AND BECAME A CHAIR ON WHICH HE SAT DOWN QUITE COMPOSEDLY THERE SAID THE CARRIER TURNING TO HIS WIFE
FOR WHO WOULD TAKE HER ASSURANCE OF IT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION THE WORLD MUST JUDGE FROM PROBABILITIES SHE HAD NOTHING AGAINST HER BUT HER HUSBAND AND HER CONSCIENCE
THEN THERE'S GUY THAT WAS A PITIFUL BUSINESS BESIDES SHIFTING TO THE GENERAL EVERY ONE IS THE BETTER FOR SOME REGULAR WORK GROANS I SHALL STICK TO IT SHE CONTINUED SMILING
NOR IN THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN JOURNALISM AND LITERATURE WHICH WAS STARTED AS A CONVERSATIONAL HARE THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE DARTED AFTER IT WITH CRIES OF JOY MARGARET LEADING THEM
BUT I THINK SHE SUSPECTED ME UP TO THE LAST BAGS I WRITING TO AUNT JULEY ABOUT THIS NOW MEG REMEMBER BAGS I BAG IT BY ALL MEANS
AS WELL AS SHE HAD DONE AT CHURCHHILL AS SHE MUST CONFESS HERSELF TO HAVE SOMETIMES AN ANXIOUS DOUBT OF LONDON'S PERFECTLY AGREEING WITH HER MISSUS VERNON ENCOURAGING THE DOUBT DIRECTLY PROPOSED HER NIECE'S RETURNING WITH THEM INTO THE COUNTRY
I NEVER FOLLOW ANY ARGUMENTS I AM ONLY TOO THANKFUL NOT TO HAVE A VOTE MYSELF
WON'T YOU EVEN HAVE COFFEE THEY LEFT THE DINING ROOM CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND AS MISSUS WILCOX BUTTONED UP HER JACKET SHE SAID WHAT AN INTERESTING LIFE YOU ALL LEAD IN LONDON NO
SIR JAMES MAY SEEM TO HAVE DRAWN A HARDER LOT THAN MERE FOLLY MERITED I LEAVE HIM THEREFORE TO ALL THE PITY THAT ANYBODY CAN GIVE HIM FOR MYSELF I CONFESS THAT I CAN PITY ONLY MISS MAINWARING WHO
CONCLUSION THIS CORRESPONDENCE BY A MEETING BETWEEN SOME OF THE PARTIES AND A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE OTHERS COULD NOT TO THE GREAT DETRIMENT OF THE POST OFFICE REVENUE BE CONTINUED ANY LONGER
ABOVE ALL DISORDERS IN THE WORLD SHE MOST DREADED THE INFLUENZA FOR HER DAUGHTER'S CONSTITUTION FREDERICA RETURNED TO CHURCHHILL WITH HER UNCLE AND AUNT AND THREE WEEKS AFTERWARDS LADY SUSAN ANNOUNCED HER BEING MARRIED TO SIR JAMES MARTIN
I KNOW WHAT I KNOW SHE KEPT REPEATING NOT UNCIVILLY BUT WITH EXTREME GLOOM
PEOPLE WILL THERE DISCUSS WITH HUMILITY VITAL QUESTIONS THAT WE HERE THINK OURSELVES TOO GOOD TO TOUCH WITH TONGS I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO PRUSSIAN SAID MISSUS WILCOX NOT EVEN TO SEE THAT INTERESTING VIEW THAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING
SAID MARGARET A LITTLE SADLY THEY ARE TOO DIFFICULT FOR ME I CAN ONLY LOOK AT THE MEN AN EMPIRE BORES ME SO FAR BUT I CAN APPRECIATE THE HEROISM THAT BUILDS IT UP LONDON BORES ME BUT WHAT THOUSANDS OF SPLENDID PEOPLE ARE LABOURING TO MAKE LONDON
A CHANCE OF OBTAINING HER SISTER IN LAW'S CONSENT TO IT HER ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT MADE HER PRESS FOR AN EARLY VISIT TO LONDON AND MISTER VERNON WHO AS IT MUST ALREADY HAVE APPEARED LIVED ONLY TO DO WHATEVER HE WAS DESIRED
INDEED THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MOST BEAUTIFUL VIEW MISS SCHLEGEL SO I SAY BUT HELEN WHO WILL MUDDLE THINGS SAYS NO IT'S LIKE MUSIC
SHE WAS PROPORTIONABLY MORE ANXIOUS TO GET FREDERICA REMOVED FROM SUCH A MOTHER AND PLACED UNDER HER OWN CARE AND THOUGH WITH LITTLE HOPE OF SUCCESS WAS RESOLVED TO LEAVE NOTHING UNATTEMPTED THAT MIGHT OFFER
AND STAMPED WITH A HUMAN FACE LONDON IS RELIGION'S OPPORTUNITY NOT THE DECOROUS RELIGION OF THEOLOGIANS BUT ANTHROPOMORPHIC CRUDE YES THE CONTINUOUS FLOW WOULD BE TOLERABLE IF A MAN OF OUR OWN SORT
THAT'S WHERE IT CUTS WHAT'S THE DAMAGE JOHN I'LL DAMAGE YOU SAID JOHN IF YOU INQUIRE DOT VERY NEAR WELL IT'S LIKE YOU TO SAY SO OBSERVED THE LITTLE MAN IT'S YOUR KIND WAY
HAD LITTLE TO SAY TO STRANGERS WHO HAD NEVER SHARED IT AND WHOSE AGE WAS HALF HER OWN CLEVER TALK ALARMED HER AND WITHERED HER DELICATE IMAGININGS IT WAS THE SOCIAL COUNTERPART OF A MOTORCAR ALL JERKS
I DECLARE I'VE CLEAN FORGOTTEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE CART SAID JOHN HE WAS ASLEEP AMONG THE STRAW THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM I'VE
CLIPPED WORDS FORMLESS SENTENCES POTTED EXPRESSIONS OF APPROVAL OR DISGUST MONTH BY MONTH THINGS WERE STEPPING LIVELIER BUT TO WHAT GOAL THE POPULATION STILL ROSE BUT WHAT WAS THE QUALITY OF THE MEN BORN
MAKING NO MORE OF BOXER THAN IF HE HAD BEEN A HOUSE LAMB THE CARRIER AND HIS WIFE EXCHANGED A LOOK OF PERPLEXITY THE STRANGER RAISED HIS HEAD AND GLANCING FROM THE LATTER TO THE FORMER SAID YOUR DAUGHTER MY GOOD FRIEND
DID HE AT ALL KNOW WHERE HE WANTED TO LIVE TIBBY DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE DID KNOW DID HE AT ALL KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO DO HE WAS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN BUT WHEN PRESSED REMARKED THAT HE SHOULD PREFER TO BE QUITE FREE OF ANY PROFESSION
LADY SUSAN WAS UNABLE TO EXPRESS HER SENSE OF SUCH KINDNESS YET KNEW NOT FROM A VARIETY OF REASONS HOW TO PART WITH HER DAUGHTER AND AS THOUGH HER OWN PLANS WERE NOT YET WHOLLY FIXED
HER HUSBAND MAY BE THOUGH SAID MARGARET MOVING TO THE WINDOW
NEVER MIND THAT IT WOULD BE CHEAP TO ME WHAT EVER IT COST RETURNED THE LITTLE MAN ANYTHING ELSE JOHN A SMALL BOX REPLIED THE CARRIER HERE YOU ARE FOR CALEB PLUMMER
AND WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN HER OWN VIEWS ONLY FEARED GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ACCOMPLISHING THEM THE FIRST HOPE OF ANYTHING BETTER WAS DERIVED FROM LADY SUSAN'S ASKING HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT FREDERICA LOOKED QUITE
THEN WITH A NEWBORN EMOTION THEY SHOOK HANDS THE CONVERSATION CEASED SUDDENLY WHEN MARGARET RE ENTERED THE DINING ROOM HER FRIENDS HAD BEEN TALKING OVER HER NEW FRIEND AND HAD DISMISSED HER AS
VERY NEARLY REMEMBERED HIM TWICE SINCE I CAME IN BUT HE WENT OUT OF MY HEAD AGAIN
OVER TWO YEARS PASSED AND THE SCHLEGEL HOUSEHOLD CONTINUED TO LEAD ITS LIFE OF CULTURED BUT NOT IGNOBLE EASE STILL SWIMMING GRACEFULLY ON THE GREY TIDES OF LONDON
SUCH MEN GIVE ME MORE PLEASURE THAN MANY WHO ARE BETTER EQUIPPED AND I THINK IT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE WORKED REGULARLY AND HONESTLY SPARE ME THE WILCOXES HE MOANED
AND FOR DISCUSSING WITH HUMILITY I AM TOO OLD WE NEVER DISCUSS ANYTHING
THAT'S THE WAY I FOUND HIM SITTING BY THE ROADSIDE UPRIGHT AS A MILESTONE AND ALMOST AS DEAF SITTING IN THE OPEN AIR JOHN IN THE OPEN AIR REPLIED THE CARRIER JUST AT DUSK CARRIAGE PAID HE SAID AND GAVE ME EIGHTEEN PENCE THEN HE GOT IN AND
A DESCRIPTION WHICH WILL EQUALLY APPLY TO HIS VOICE OR AT JOHN FOR ANOTHER SAID CALEB OR AT TILLY AS FAR AS THAT GOES OR CERTAINLY AT BOXER BUSY JUST NOW CALEB ASKED THE CARRIER WHY PRETTY WELL JOHN
AND AM NOT PRETENDING
NICER THAN WOMEN LABOURING UNDER SUCH A DELUSION WHY DO YOU NOT MARRY I SOMETIMES JOLLY WELL THINK I WOULD IF I GOT THE CHANCE HAS NOBODY ARST YOU ONLY NINNIES DO PEOPLE ASK HELEN PLENTIFULLY TELL ME ABOUT THEM
IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM SAID MISSUS WILCOX UNEXPECTEDLY CATCHING ON TO THE THOUGHT AND ROUSING FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME A FAINT HOPE IN THE BREASTS OF THE DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE IT CANNOT STAND WITHOUT THEM AND I SOMETIMES THINK BUT
SHE INSTINCTIVELY MADE A CHARGE OR BUTT AT HIM WITH THE ONLY OFFENSIVE INSTRUMENT WITHIN HER REACH THIS INSTRUMENT HAPPENING TO BE THE BABY GREAT COMMOTION AND ALARM ENSUED WHICH THE SAGACITY OF BOXER RATHER TENDED TO INCREASE
AND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS ONE OF POLITE BEWILDERMENT HER TASTES WERE SIMPLE HER KNOWLEDGE OF CULTURE SLIGHT AND SHE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THE NEW ENGLISH ART CLUB
FLATTERED AND FINESSED INTO AN AFFECTION FOR HER WHICH ALLOWING LEISURE FOR THE CONQUEST OF HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MOTHER FOR HIS ABJURING ALL FUTURE ATTACHMENTS AND DETESTING THE SEX MIGHT BE REASONABLY LOOKED FOR IN THE COURSE OF A TWELVEMONTH
SAID CALEB AFTER PONDERING A LITTLE WHILE TO BE SURE THAT'S WHAT I CAME FOR BUT MY HEAD'S SO RUNNING ON THEM ARKS AND THINGS HE HASN'T BEEN HERE HAS HE NOT HE RETURNED THE CARRIER HE'S TOO BUSY COURTING
WORK WORK WORK IF YOU'D SAVE YOUR SOUL AND YOUR BODY IT IS HONESTLY A NECESSITY DEAR BOY LOOK AT THE WILCOXES LOOK AT MISTER PEMBROKE WITH ALL THEIR DEFECTS OF TEMPER AND UNDERSTANDING
NEVER SAID MISSUS WILCOX GRAVELY
MURMURED MARGARET PUTTING DOWN HER WORK I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS SO FUNNY HELEN IT MEANS SOME HORRIBLE VOLCANO SMOKING SOMEWHERE DOESN'T IT
FOR ANOTHER YOU YOUNGER PEOPLE MOVE SO QUICKLY THAT IT DAZES ME CHARLES IS THE SAME DOLLY THE SAME BUT WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT OLD AND YOUNG I NEVER FORGET THAT THEY WERE SILENT FOR A MOMENT
WITH A LATCH THAT ANY ONE COULD LIFT IF HE CHOSE AND A GOOD MANY PEOPLE DID CHOOSE FOR ALL KINDS OF NEIGHBOURS LIKED TO HAVE A CHEERFUL WORD OR TWO WITH THE CARRIER THOUGH HE WAS NO GREAT TALKER HIMSELF
OH YES OR ILFRACOMBE AND SWANAGE AND TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND SURBITON AND BEDFORD THERE ON NO ACCOUNT LONDON THEN
IF YOU PLEASE I WAS TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR SAID THE STRANGER MILDLY DON'T MIND ME
SOME KNEW WHAT OTHERS KNEW AND OTHERS DIDN'T AND IF THEY DIDN'T THEN OTHERS AGAIN HAD BETTER BE CAREFUL
TIME SUFFERED NO INCONVENIENCE BUT ALL NIGHT AND ALL THIS MORNING HER APPREHENSIONS GREW BREAKFAST DIDN'T SEEM THE SAME NO NO MORE DID LUNCH AND SO SHE STROLLED UP TO TWO WICKHAM PLACE AS BEING THE MOST LIKELY PLACE FOR THE MISSING
I GET UP SAID MANICAMP STRETCHING HIMSELF IN HIS BED COMPLACENTLY OH NO THANK YOU YOU HAVE SOLD ALL YOUR CLOTHES NO I HAVE ONE SUIT LEFT THE HANDSOMEST EVEN BUT I EXPECT A PURCHASER
AND HE TOOK THE TWENTY PISTOLES NOW THEN BE OFF WELL AS I CANNOT BE BACK BEFORE TO MORROW WE HAVE TIME TIME FOR WHAT TIME TO PLAY WHAT DO YOU WISH TO PLAY WITH YOUR TWENTY PISTOLES PARDIEU

THE PRESENT AFFAIR IS TO PROCURE FOR ME A SECOND PLACE OF MAID OF HONOR MY FRIEND IF YOU WERE TO PROMISE ME THE PRICE OF HEAVEN I WOULD DECLINE TO DISTURB MYSELF AT THIS MOMENT MALICORNE CHINKED THE MONEY IN HIS POCKET THERE ARE TWENTY PISTOLES HERE SAID MALICORNE
I HAVE DECLARED MY SENTIMENTS TO YOU CONTINUED MALICORNE
I DOUBT IT AND I SWEAR IT COXCOMB AND THEN THAT IS NOT THE TRUE REASON
WHAT SOMETHING IMPORTANT
BUT MALICORNE SUSTAINED THE ATTACK BRAVELY
AT THE HEAD OF A SHOPKEEPER WITHOUT ANY INTRODUCTION IN THE NATURE OF AN ARTICLE AND IF IT HAPPENED NOT TO BE THE NAME OF THE THING SHE WANTED TO LOOK ROUND FOR THAT THING LAY HOLD OF IT AND HOLD ON BY IT UNTIL THE BARGAIN WAS CONCLUDED SHE ALWAYS MADE A BARGAIN FOR IT BY HOLDING UP
NO GARRET NO SHOEMAKING NO ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE NORTH TOWER NOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE TASK HE HAD SET HIMSELF HIS PROMISE WAS REDEEMED HE HAD SAVED CHARLES LET THEM ALL LEAN UPON HIM
FOR A WEEK AT LEAST WAS CONSEQUENTLY VERY SAD HE WAS EXPECTING A USURER AND SAW MALICORNE ENTER A CRY OF DISTRESS ESCAPED HIM EH WHAT SAID HE IN A TONE WHICH NOTHING CAN DESCRIBE IS THAT YOU AGAIN DEAR FRIEND

THAT I HEARD STRANGE FEET UPON THE STAIRS MY LOVE THE STAIRCASE IS AS STILL AS DEATH AS HE SAID THE WORD A BLOW WAS STRUCK UPON THE DOOR
AURE WOULD HAVE CRIED OUT BUT THE CRY WAS STIFLED IN HIS KISS NERVOUS AND APPARENTLY ANGRY THE YOUNG GIRL PUSHED MALICORNE AGAINST THE WALL GOOD SAID MALICORNE PHILOSOPHICALLY THAT'S ENOUGH FOR SIX WEEKS ADIEU MADEMOISELLE ACCEPT MY VERY HUMBLE SALUTATION
A RUDE CLATTERING OF FEET OVER THE FLOOR AND FOUR ROUGH MEN IN RED CAPS ARMED WITH SABRES AND PISTOLS ENTERED THE ROOM THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SAID THE FIRST WHO SEEKS HIM
THEIR HOUSEKEEPING WAS OF A VERY FRUGAL KIND NOT ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS THE SAFEST WAY OF LIFE INVOLVING THE LEAST OFFENCE TO THE PEOPLE BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT RICH AND CHARLES THROUGHOUT HIS IMPRISONMENT HAD HAD TO PAY HEAVILY FOR HIS BAD FOOD
EH WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT FIVE HUNDRED PISTOLES I SAY IT IS FOR NOTHING MY FRIEND SAID MANICAMP TAKING UP THE PEN AGAIN AND YOU EXHAUST MY CREDIT DICTATE MALICORNE CONTINUED WHICH MY FRIEND THE COMTE DE GUICHE WILL OBTAIN FOR MY FRIEND MALICORNE

THAT HE STOOD WITH THE LAMP IN HIS HAND
CHAPTER FIVE MANICAMP AND MALICORNE
BY THE CITIZEN AND CITIZENESS DEFARGE AND BY ONE OTHER WHAT OTHER DO YOU ASK CITIZEN DOCTOR YES
AND FOR HIS GUARD AND TOWARDS THE LIVING OF THE POORER PRISONERS PARTLY ON THIS ACCOUNT AND PARTLY TO AVOID A DOMESTIC SPY THEY KEPT NO SERVANT THE CITIZEN AND CITIZENESS WHO ACTED AS PORTERS AT THE COURTYARD GATE RENDERED THEM OCCASIONAL SERVICE
WHEN IT PLEASES YOU TO BE GAY I MAKE YOU LAUGH WHEN IT SUITS ME TO BE LOVING I LOOK AT YOU I HAVE GIVEN YOU A COMMISSION OF LADY OF HONOR WHICH YOU WISHED FOR YOU WILL GIVE ME PRESENTLY SOMETHING I WISH FOR I WILL YES YOU WILL BUT AT THIS MOMENT MY DEAR AURE
JUST SO SIXTEEN HOURS IN ALL
THE REPUBLIC GOES BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE IS SUPREME EVREMONDE WE ARE PRESSED ONE WORD THE DOCTOR ENTREATED WILL YOU TELL ME WHO DENOUNCED HIM IT IS AGAINST RULE ANSWERED THE FIRST BUT YOU CAN ASK HIM OF SAINT ANTOINE HERE
THE PEOPLE WERE SO PASSIONATELY REVENGEFUL AND FITFUL THE INNOCENT WERE SO CONSTANTLY PUT TO DEATH ON VAGUE SUSPICION AND BLACK MALICE IT WAS SO IMPOSSIBLE TO FORGET THAT MANY AS BLAMELESS AS HER HUSBAND AND AS DEAR TO OTHERS AS HE WAS TO HER
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING SAID MALICORNE PUTTING HIS WATCH QUICKLY BACK INTO HIS FOB AH TRUE
I HAVE SAVED HIM IT WAS NOT ANOTHER OF THE DREAMS IN WHICH HE HAD OFTEN COME BACK HE WAS REALLY HERE AND YET HIS WIFE TREMBLED AND A VAGUE BUT HEAVY FEAR WAS UPON HER ALL THE AIR ROUND WAS SO THICK AND DARK
HE TOOK THE LAMP IN HIS HAND
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY IMPERTINENT FOR THAT OH THAT YES THAT'S TRUE YOU SEE PLAINLY THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO AVOW IT SAID MALICORNE MONSIEUR MALICORNE DON'T LET US BE ANGRY IF YOU HAVE RETAINED ME THEN IT HAS NOT BEEN WITHOUT CAUSE
TO WHOM DO YOU TELL THAT WHEN I AM KING I PROMISE YOU ONE THING WHAT TO CALL YOURSELF MALICORNE THE FIRST NO TO MAKE YOU SUPERINTENDENT OF MY FINANCES BUT THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION NOW UNFORTUNATELY
EMBROIDERED AND LACED WITH GOLD WHICH HAD BEEN THE ADMIRATION OF THE COURT BUT TO BE ABLE TO SELL THIS SUIT THE LAST HE HAD LEFT
LEANT FROM TIME TO TIME VERY LOVINGLY TOWARDS HIS INTERLOCUTRIX WHO WE MUST SAY DID NOT ALWAYS DRAW BACK SO RAPIDLY AS STRICT PROPRIETY HAD A RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE YOUNG GIRL
AND AS THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS DEEPENED THE OWNER OF THAT NAME HIMSELF APPEARED FROM OVERLOOKING A PAINTER WHOM DOCTOR MANETTE HAD EMPLOYED TO ADD TO THE LIST THE NAME OF CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY IN THE UNIVERSAL FEAR AND DISTRUST THAT DARKENED THE TIME
SHALL I HAVE MY BREVET TO BE SURE YOU SHALL SOON TO DAY OH TAKE CARE MONSIEUR DE MANICAMP YOU UNDERTAKE MUCH AND I DO NOT ASK THAT THIRTY LEAGUES IN A DAY IS TOO MUCH YOU WOULD KILL YOURSELF
NOW MONSIEUR MALICORNE SAID THE YOUNG GIRL DOES IT AT LENGTH PLEASE YOU THAT WE SHOULD TALK REASONABLY YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT IS VERY EASY MADEMOISELLE AURE REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN TO DO WHAT WE LIKE WHEN WE CAN ONLY DO WHAT WE ARE ABLE GOOD
I HAVE ALREADY OBTAINED FOR YOU WHAT TWELVE HUNDRED WOMEN ARE TRYING FOR
YOU FLATTER ME WHO I YES YOU HOW SO SINCE I MAINTAIN THAT I HAVE NO CREDIT AND YOU MAINTAIN I HAVE WELL THEN MY COMMISSION WELL YOUR COMMISSION SHALL I HAVE IT OR SHALL I NOT YOU SHALL HAVE IT
YOU MISTOOK ME MY FRIEND YOU DID NOT HEAR PLAINLY WHAT DID YOU SAY THEN I SAID FIVE HUNDRED AND THE FIVE HUNDRED HERE THEY ARE MANICAMP DEVOURED THE ROULEAU WITH HIS EYES
MIGHT HAVE KNOWN AS MUCH OF THEIR LANGUAGE AS OF HER OWN IF SHE HAD HAD A MIND SHE HAD NO MIND IN THAT DIRECTION CONSEQUENTLY SHE KNEW NO MORE OF THAT NONSENSE AS SHE WAS PLEASED TO CALL IT THAN MISTER CRUNCHER DID
AND JERRY ALMOST WHOLLY TRANSFERRED TO THEM BY MISTER LORRY HAD BECOME THEIR DAILY RETAINER AND HAD HIS BED THERE EVERY NIGHT IT WAS AN ORDINANCE OF THE REPUBLIC ONE AND INDIVISIBLE OF LIBERTY EQUALITY FRATERNITY OR DEATH
AND SO SAYING MALICORNE DREW THE YOUNG GIRL A SECOND TIME TOWARDS HIM BUT AT THAT INSTANT A STEP RESOUNDED ON THE STAIRCASE THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE SO CLOSE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IN THE ARMS OF EACH OTHER IF MONTALAIS HAD NOT VIOLENTLY PUSHED MALICORNE WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOOR JUST THEN OPENING
AND AFTER WHAT FASHION OH THAT IS RATHER TRYING I WARN YOU THE DEVIL
OF WHAT ASKED THE DOCTOR CITIZEN DOCTOR SAID THE FIRST WITH HIS FORMER RELUCTANCE ASK NO MORE IF THE REPUBLIC DEMANDS SACRIFICES FROM YOU
I FEAR NOT YET IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR CHARLES YET
IT IS NOT AT LEAST BECAUSE I LOVE YOU CRIED MONTALAIS
THE DOCTOR TURNED HIS EYES UPON THAT MAN WHO MOVED UNEASILY ON HIS FEET RUBBED HIS BEARD A LITTLE AND AT LENGTH SAID WELL TRULY IT IS AGAINST RULE BUT HE IS DENOUNCED AND GRAVELY
WE ALL KNOW YOU CITIZEN DOCTOR SAID THE OTHER THREE
MISS PROSS CURTSEYED AT THE NAME AND AS SUCH MY MAXIM IS CONFOUND THEIR POLITICS FRUSTRATE THEIR KNAVISH TRICKS ON HIM OUR HOPES WE FIX GOD SAVE THE KING
THAT WILL BE TWENTY EIGHT LEAGUES I SHALL HAVE GONE FOR THE LOVE OF YOU THEN WITH HIS SARDONIC SMILE TAKING UP THE INTERRUPTED SENTENCE
IN HAND WELL BE IT SO I LAY SAID MALICORNE CURIOUS ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW THIS SELLER OF CLOTHES WOULD GET THROUGH IS IT AGREED IT IS PASS ME THE PEN INK AND PAPER HERE THEY ARE THANK YOU
DE MANICAMP THIS PAINFUL TASK ACCOMPLISHED HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN IN BED AGAIN WELL ASKED MALICORNE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY TO HAVE THE LETTER FROM THE COMTE DE GUICHE FOR MONSIEUR I HAVE WON MY WAGER HOW THE DEVIL IS THAT
THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE COMTE DE GUICHE'S LETTER IN HOW SOON IN EIGHT HOURS HAVE YOU A WINGED HORSE THEN THAT IS NO MATTER WILL YOU BET I SHALL HAVE THE COMTE'S LETTER IN EIGHT HOURS YES IN HAND
AH NO I AM COME TO TELL YOU THAT MADAME HENRIETTA OF ENGLAND IS COMING TO MARRY THE KING'S BROTHER INDEED MALICORNE YOU ARE INSUPPORTABLE WITH YOUR NEWS OF THE LAST CENTURY NOW MIND IF YOU PERSIST IN THIS BAD HABIT OF LAUGHING AT PEOPLE I WILL HAVE YOU TURNED OUT
GOING ON IN THE STREETS NOW LADYBIRD NEVER YOU STIR FROM THAT FIRE TILL I COME BACK TAKE CARE OF THE DEAR HUSBAND YOU HAVE RECOVERED AND DON'T MOVE YOUR PRETTY HEAD FROM HIS SHOULDER AS YOU HAVE IT NOW TILL YOU SEE ME AGAIN
AND FIXING HIS TWO GREAT EYES UPON MALICORNE YOU ARE RIGHT SAID HE
TO AVOID ATTRACTING NOTICE AND TO GIVE AS LITTLE OCCASION AS POSSIBLE FOR TALK AND ENVY WAS THE GENERAL DESIRE FOR SOME MONTHS PAST MISS PROSS AND MISTER CRUNCHER HAD DISCHARGED THE OFFICE OF PURVEYORS THE FORMER CARRYING THE MONEY
THESE TWO PERSONS SO OCCUPIED NOT BY THE DEATH OF THE DUKE BUT BY THE CONVERSATION WHICH WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT DEATH
WE ARE GOING THERE AND SO IT WAS FOR THAT MOTIVE ONLY YOU HAVE SERVED ME SELFISH FELLOW WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME SAY AURE I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU WELL IN TRUTH IT IS JUST SO WITH ME YOU ARE NEVERTHELESS IT MUST BE CONFESSED A VERY BAD HEARTED YOUNG MAN
BEWARE MONTALAIS I KNOW YOU SAID MALICORNE YOU ARE GOING TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT WELL YES SAID SHE HANGING ROUND HIS NECK WITH CHILDISH INDOLENCE RATHER THAN WITH LOVING ABANDONMENT WELL YES FOR I MUST THANK YOU AT LEAST AND FOR WHAT
I THINK NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE WHEN OBLIGING A FRIEND YOU ARE QUITE HEROIC WHERE ARE THE TWENTY PISTOLES HERE THEY ARE SAID MALICORNE SHOWING THEM THAT'S WELL
DECIDEDLY MANICAMP YOU ARE A GREAT MAN
AND FOURTEEN LEAGUES BACK DOUBTLESS WELL FOR THESE TWENTY EIGHT LEAGUES YOU CANNOT ALLOW LESS THAN FOURTEEN HOURS THAT IS AGREED ONE HOUR TO FIND THE COMTE DE GUICHE GO ON
DON'T YOU MOVE LADYBIRD THEY WENT OUT LEAVING LUCIE AND HER HUSBAND HER FATHER AND THE CHILD BY A BRIGHT FIRE MISTER LORRY WAS EXPECTED BACK PRESENTLY FROM THE BANKING HOUSE MISS PROSS HAD LIGHTED THE LAMP
WITH A MIEN SOMETIMES LIVELY AND SOMETIMES DULL MAKING GOOD USE OF TWO LARGE EYES SHADED WITH LONG EYE LASHES WAS SHORT OF STATURE AND SWART OF SKIN HE SMILED WITH AN ENORMOUS BUT WELL FURNISHED MOUTH AND HIS POINTED CHIN WHICH APPEARED TO ENJOY A MOBILITY
MALICORNE RETURNED THE RECOMMENDATION MANICAMP ADDED THE WORDS GOOD SAID MALICORNE TAKING BACK THE PAPER MANICAMP BEGAN TO COUNT OUT THE PISTOLES THERE WANT TWENTY SAID HE HOW SO THE TWENTY I HAVE WON
ALL THE USUAL HARMLESS WAYS OF LIFE WERE CHANGED IN THE DOCTOR'S LITTLE HOUSEHOLD AS IN VERY MANY OTHERS THE ARTICLES OF DAILY CONSUMPTION THAT WERE WANTED WERE PURCHASED EVERY EVENING IN SMALL QUANTITIES AND AT VARIOUS SMALL SHOPS
THAT YOU DID NOT LOVE ME YOU HAVE EMBRACED ME ONCE WITHOUT LAUGHING AND THAT IS ALL I WANT ALL SAID THE PROUD AND COQUETTISH MONTALAIS IN A TONE THROUGH WHICH THE WOUNDED PRIDE WAS VISIBLE ABSOLUTELY ALL MADEMOISELLE REPLIED MALICORNE AH
THE YOUNG GIRL PRESENTED A SINGULAR MIXTURE OF SHYNESS AND REFLECTION SHE WAS CHARMING WHEN SHE LAUGHED BEAUTIFUL WHEN SHE BECAME SERIOUS BUT LET US HASTEN TO SAY SHE WAS MORE FREQUENTLY CHARMING THAN BEAUTIFUL THESE TWO APPEARED TO HAVE ATTAINED THE CULMINATING POINT OF A DISCUSSION HALF BANTERING HALF SERIOUS
MANICAMP HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE TO HIS BED NO MORE FIRE NO MORE POCKET MONEY NO MORE WALKING MONEY
AND WHAT DO YOU DESIRE MONSIEUR DEMON THAT I SHOULD LOSE MY SOUL FROM ANGER MALICORNE WAS ROLLING HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY BETWEEN HIS FINGERS BUT ALL AT ONCE HE LET FALL HIS HAT SEIZED THE YOUNG GIRL BY THE SHOULDERS PULLED HER TOWARDS HIM AND SEALED HER MOUTH WITH TWO LIPS THAT WERE VERY WARM
IN WHAT WAY BY LAYING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE LETTER FROM THE COMTE DE GUICHE IN EIGHT HOURS AH THAT'S FAIR AND HE GAVE HIM THE TWENTY PISTOLES
HUMPH YOU ARE VERY POLITE SAID MALICORNE AY BUT LOOK YOU I WAS EXPECTING MONEY AND INSTEAD OF MONEY I SEE YOU
THAT IS TRANSPARENT ENOUGH I THINK YOU TAKE THAT PAPER
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD QUIETLY LISTEN MONTALAIS SAID HE WITHOUT HEEDING WHETHER THAT FAMILIARITY PLEASED HIS MISTRESS OR NOT LET US NOT DISPUTE ABOUT IT AND WHY NOT BECAUSE DURING THE YEAR WHICH I HAVE KNOWN YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD ME TURNED OUT OF DOORS TWENTY TIMES IF I DID NOT PLEASE YOU
HE HAD A FORTNIGHT BEFORE EXTORTED FROM THE COMTE DE GUICHE A HUNDRED PISTOLES ALL HE HAD
THE LATTER THE BASKET EVERY AFTERNOON AT ABOUT THE TIME WHEN THE PUBLIC LAMPS WERE LIGHTED THEY FARED FORTH ON THIS DUTY AND MADE AND BROUGHT HOME SUCH PURCHASES AS WERE NEEDFUL ALTHOUGH MISS PROSS THROUGH HER LONG ASSOCIATION WITH A FRENCH FAMILY
OH YES FOR REALLY YOU EXASPERATE ME THERE THERE PATIENCE MADEMOISELLE YOU WANT TO MAKE YOURSELF OF CONSEQUENCE I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHY GO TELL ME AND I WILL ANSWER YOU FRANKLY YES IF THE THING BE TRUE
AS SHE READ HER FACE BRIGHTENED MALICORNE CRIED SHE AFTER HAVING READ IT IN TRUTH YOU ARE A GOOD LAD WHAT FOR MADEMOISELLE
AT THIS MOMENT YOU WOULD ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE THROWN OUT OF THAT WINDOW RATHER THAN ALLOW ME TO KISS THE TIP OF YOUR FINGER I WOULD PRECIPITATE MYSELF FROM THE TOP OF THE BALCONY RATHER THAN TOUCH THE HEM OF YOUR ROBE BUT IN FIVE MINUTES YOU WILL LOVE ME AND I SHALL ADORE YOU OH IT IS JUST SO
A FORTNIGHT MADEMOISELLE SAID MALICORNE BOWING MONTALAIS LIFTED UP HER LITTLE DOUBLED FIST MONSTER SAID SHE OH THAT I WERE A MAN WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO ME I WOULD STRANGLE YOU AH VERY WELL THEN SAID MALICORNE I BELIEVE I BEGIN TO DESIRE SOMETHING
BUT THE BENEFIT WILL BE I HOPE IN PROPORTION WITH THE EXPENSE AND MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE WILL BRING ME BACK MORE THAN MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS OR ELSE OR ELSE MY NAME IS NOT MALICORNE
MAY I ASK A QUESTION DOCTOR MANETTE BEFORE I GO I THINK YOU MAY TAKE THAT LIBERTY THE DOCTOR ANSWERED SMILING FOR GRACIOUS SAKE DON'T TALK ABOUT LIBERTY WE HAVE QUITE ENOUGH OF THAT SAID MISS PROSS HUSH DEAR AGAIN
BUT HAD PUT IT ASIDE IN A CORNER THAT THEY MIGHT ENJOY THE FIRE LIGHT UNDISTURBED LITTLE LUCIE SAT BY HER GRANDFATHER WITH HER HANDS CLASPED THROUGH HIS ARM AND HE IN A TONE NOT RISING MUCH ABOVE A WHISPER BEGAN TO TELL HER A STORY OF A GREAT AND POWERFUL FAIRY
WHO I YES YOU QUIT THAT LAWYER'S LOGIC MY DEAR ANOTHER IMPOSSIBILITY CLERK I AM MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS DEMOISELLE I AM MONSIEUR MALICORNE ALAS I KNOW IT WELL AND YOU OVERWHELM ME BY YOUR RANK SO I WILL SAY NO MORE TO YOU
FOR THE REST A JOYOUS BEAM OF THE SUN FOR THE SUN APPEARED TO CARE LITTLE FOR THE LOSS FRANCE HAD JUST SUFFERED A SUNBEAM WE SAY DESCENDED UPON THEM DRAWING PERFUMES FROM THE NEIGHBORING FLOWERS AND ANIMATING THE WALLS THEMSELVES
SAID HER FATHER STOPPING IN HIS STORY AND LAYING HIS HAND ON HERS COMMAND YOURSELF WHAT A DISORDERED STATE YOU ARE IN THE LEAST THING NOTHING STARTLES YOU YOU YOUR FATHER'S DAUGHTER
AS MUCH FOR BED AND SUPPER
TILL UNDER HIS WORSHIPPING EYES HER OWN FILLED WITH SLOW ECSTATIC TEARS DOCTOR CALLED A STARTLED VOICE ROW OUT I AM RIGHT UNDER THE TREES THEY BOTH STARTED
BEGAN THE READING OF THE DESIGNATED LINES HER VOICE SOUNDED UNUSUALLY CLEAR AND SWEET YET LACKED SOMETHING OF THE POWER OF EXPRESSION DISPLAYED BY GRACE IN HER RENDERING OF THE SAME SCENE WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED
RUTH IN A WHITE WOOL GOWN SAT OPPOSITE HIM IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DINED WITH THEM AND HE ENJOYED A SINGULAR FEELING OVER THE SITUATION
I SUPPOSE WE SHALL ALL BE THROUGH DINNER BY HALF PAST TWO YOU HAD BETTER BRING YOUR GIRLS TO MY HOUSE EACH OF YOU IS TO HAVE TWO AND JESSICA HAS ONE BESIDES MABEL I AM TO HAVE THREE I FOUND ANOTHER YESTERDAY DAVID PROMISED TO GET ME THE TICKETS
IN THE BOW I DISLIKE TO SEE DANGERS BEFORE WE COME TO THEM HE HELPED HER CAREFULLY TO HER PLACE SHE THANKED HIM LAUGHINGLY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ARM AND HE TURNED TO RUTH I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO MOVE FROM MY PLACE SHE SAID IN DEFIANT MISCHIEF
HOWEVER I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER MUCH ABOUT THE PLAY NOW FOR THE SENIOR TEAM HAS JUST SENT ME A CHALLENGE TO PLAY THEM SATURDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH SO I'LL HAVE TO GET THE TEAM TOGETHER AND GO TO WORK WE'RE AWFULLY LATE THIS YEAR ABOUT STARTING DON'T YOU THINK SO ASKED NORA
THERE IS NOTHING ABROAD HERE BUT THE STARS SHE ANSWERED FLITTING BEFORE THEM AND THEY ARE STANCH SILENT FRIENDS ON SUCH A NIGHT REMARKED KEMP SOFTLY
BUT SHE WAS TOO OVERCOME TO THANK THEM AND SMILED AT THEM THROUGH A MIST OF TEARS LOOK AT ELEANOR WHISPERED NORA TO GRACE SHE'S SO ANGRY SHE CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT SHE MUST HAVE WANTED TO PLAY ROSALIND HERSELF
ANNE STOOD PERFECTLY STILL LOOKING RATHER DAZED THE UNEXPECTED HAD HAPPENED SHE WAS TO HAVE NOT ONLY A PART BUT THE BEST PART AT THAT THE GIRLS GATHERED EAGERLY ABOUT HER CONGRATULATING HER ON HER SUCCESS
AND SEATED THUS KEMP'S KNEES WERE NOT HALF A FOOT FROM RUTH'S WHITE GOWN WILL YOU DIRECT ME HE SAID AS HE SWEPT AROUND I HAVE NOT ROWED ON THIS RIVER FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS YOU CAN KEEP STRAIGHT AHEAD FOR SOME DISTANCE SHE SAID LEANING BACK IN HER SEAT
WHEN HE TURNED FOR RUTH SHE HAD ALREADY SPRUNG ASHORE AND HAD STARTED UP THE SLOPE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OARS LAY FORGOTTEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT
YES ADMITTED GRACE I AM JUST AS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER BASKETBALL AS EVER ONLY I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO DEVOTE TO IT THAT I DID LAST YEAR NEVER MIND YOU'LL MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AFTER THANKSGIVING SAID ANNE SOOTHINGLY AS FOR ME I'M GOING TO DREAM ABOUT THE PLAY
ALTHOUGH THE GIRLS BELONGING TO JULIA'S PARTY WERE SILENT CONCERNING WHAT HAPPENED AT THE OMNIBUS HOUSE THE STORY LEAKED OUT CREATING CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE TWO UPPER CLASSES JULIA CROSBY HAD A SHREWD SUSPICION
BY A VAGUE SOMETHING IN KEMP'S EYES THE FEELING HOWEVER HAD VANISHED GRADUALLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DOCTOR ALWAYS HAD A PECULIARLY INTENT GAZE AND MOREOVER NO ONE COULD HAVE HELPED APPRECIATING HER LOVELINESS THAT NIGHT
YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN HE SAID MOTIONING TO THE ROWER'S SEAT AND YOU SHE ASKED I SHALL SIT BESIDE YOU AND USE THE OTHER OAR HE ANSWERED NONCHALANTLY SMILING DOWN AT HER WITH A HALF PLEASED FEELING OF DISCOMFITURE
SHE COULD NOT YET MEET HIS EYES AGAIN COME RUTH EITHER STAY WITH US OR JUST AHEAD OF US
I SUPPOSE IT'S THE SENSE OF POWER THAT ONE HAS OVER PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS THAT MAKES ACTING SO FASCINATING IT IS THE OTHER SIDE THAT I HATE SHE ADDED WITH A SLIGHT SHUDDER I SUPPOSE THEATRICAL PEOPLE DO UNDERGO MANY HARDSHIPS SAID GRACE
BY THE WAY GIRLS DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE OF ANY USE TO INVITE ELEANOR ELEANOR EXCLAIMED NORA AFTER WHAT SHE HAS SAID TO YOU YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW YOUR INVITATION INTO THE FIRE FOR IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT SHE WILL DO SO WHEN SHE RECEIVES IT
WAS SUCH AS WOULD PROVE DANGEROUSLY SEDUCTIVE TO ANY WOMAN WHOM HE CARED TO HONOR WITH HIS FAVOR BUT WITH A GET THEE BEHIND ME SATAN DESIRE HE HAD PUT THE QUESTION FROM HIM HE COULD HAVE TAKEN HIS OATH ON RUTH'S HEART WHOLENESS
AND DISGUST THE NIGHT WITH LACK OF APPRECIATION SHE TURNED TO A CORNER OF THE PORCH AND LIFTED A PAIR OF OARS TO HER SHOULDER WHY HE SAID IN SURPRISE COMING TOWARD HER YOU KEEP YOUR OARS AT HOME ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NEITHER A BORROWER NOR A LENDER BE
YET NOW AS HE RECOGNIZED HER COMPANION HIS MISGIVINGS RETURNED THREEFOLD THE COURTEOUS GENTLEMAN HOWEVER WAS AT HIS EASE AS THEY CAME UP THIS IS A SURPRISE DOCTOR HE EXCLAIMED CORDIALLY OPENING THE GATE AND EXTENDING HIS HAND
STANDING MOTIONLESS BESIDE THE BOAT YOUR PLACE AH YES NOW HE SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HER WILL YOU STEP IN SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND STEPPED IN THEY WERE BOTH STANDING AND AS THE LITTLE BARK SWAYED HE MADE A MOVEMENT TO CATCH HOLD OF HER
AND HOW TO AVOID THEM THERE IS SOME CHANCE OF HER BECOMING GREAT TOO OF COURSE REAL STARS DO APPEAR ONCE IN A WHILE WHO ARE TOO TALENTED TO BE KEPT DOWN HOWEVER THE REALLY GREAT ONES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
RUTH AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE DOCTOR IF SHE HAD PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF RUTH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HIS MIND BUT SINCE HIS WIFE WAS THERE WHAT HARM COULD ACCRUE THAT HIS PRESENCE WOULD PREVENT SO WITH A SINCERE APOLOGY HE WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL
I WANTED HER TO PLAY ROSALIND AND I KNEW SHE COULD DO IT LOOK GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD IS SHAKING HANDS WITH HER TRUE ENOUGH ANNE WAS SHYLY SHAKING HANDS WITH THE GREAT ACTOR WHO WAS CONGRATULATING HER WARMLY UPON HER RECENT EFFORT
THEY HAD DRIFTED INTO A COVE AND SHE WAS COWERING FROM THE OVER HANGING BOUGHS I DO NOT CARE TO BE ABSALOMED WHERE WERE YOUR EYES RUTH SHE COMPLAINED AS KEMP PUSHED OUT WITH A HAPPY APOLOGETIC LAUGH
WE FIND IT SAVES BOTH TIME AND SPLEEN SHE HELD THEM LIGHTLY IN PLACE ON HER SHOULDER ALLOW ME HE SAID PLACING HIS HAND UPON THE OARS A SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION TOOK POSSESSION OF HER
SINGING OF LOVE THEIR EYES MET
THAT AS IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT YOUR TAKING A LITTLE ROW AND THEN EACH CAN JUDGE OF THE OTHER'S CLAIM TO SUPERIORITY MY CLAIM HAS NEVER BEEN JUSTLY ESTABLISHED SAID RUTH I HAVE NEVER ALLOWED ANY ONE TO USURP MY OARS
AND THE MOCK SERIOUS BANTERING TONES IN WHICH SHE DELIVERED ROSALIND'S WITTY SPEECHES CAUSED MISTER SOUTHARD TO SMILE AND NOD APPROVINGLY AS SHE GAVE FULL VALUE TO THE IMMORTAL LINES HER CHANGE OF VOICE FROM ROSALIND TO ORLANDO WAS WHOLLY DELIGHTFUL
SAW THE TRIO APPROACHING FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEMAN IN HIS SUMMER ATTIRE WHEN HE DID SURPRISE THEN PLEASURE THEN A SPIRIT OF INQUIETUDE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM HE HAD BEEN UNEXPECTEDLY STARTLED ON RUTH'S BIRTHNIGHT
WHO NOW THAT THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN OPENED WANTED TO HEAR MORE OF ANNE'S VIEWS OF THE STAGE UNLESS ANY GIRL HAS REMARKABLE TALENT I SHOULD ADVISE HER TO KEEP OFF THE STAGE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY OF COURSE WHEN A GIRL COMES OF A THEATRICAL FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS
CONSIDERING THAT SHE ISN'T ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH ANY OF US HAD THE GIRL CHUMS KNOWN THEN WHAT ELEANOR WAS UP TO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MATTER OF SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION TO ALL OF THEM AFTER IMPERIOUSLY COMMANDING HER SATELLITES TO WAIT FOR HER IN THE CORRIDOR
GRACE'S HEART WAS WITH HER CLASS SHE WISHED IT TO BE A CLASS AMONG CLASSES AND FELT AN ALMOST MOTHERLY ANXIETY FOR ITS SUCCESS WHAT DOES AIL SOME OF OUR CLASS SHE EXCLAIMED TO ANNE AND NORA ONE DAY AS THEY LEFT THE SCHOOL BUILDING
AND SO CHARMINGLY DID SHE DEPICT BOTH CHARACTERS THAT WHEN SHE ENDED WITH ORLANDO'S EXIT SHE RECEIVED A LITTLE OVATION FROM THE LISTENING GIRLS IN WHICH MISTER SOUTHARD AND MISS TEBBS JOINED
AND ACQUITTED THEMSELVES WITH CREDIT THEN ELEANOR'S TURN CAME HANDING HER COAT WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN OFF AND CARRIED UPON HER ARM TO EDNA WRIGHT SHE WALKED PROUDLY OVER THEN WITHOUT A TRACE OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS
THOUGH OF COURSE HE DID NOT SAY SO AS THEY STROLLED ABOUT AFTERWARD HE MANAGED TO KEEP HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM AND ALLOWED KEMP TO APPROPRIATE HIS WIFE THEY FINALLY DRIFTED TO THE COTTAGE STEPS
ELEANOR WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER BUT EDNA WRIGHT BECAME A CLOSE SECOND AND BETWEEN THEM THEY MANAGED TO DISSEMINATE A SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL THAT THE TEACHERS FOUND HARD TO COMBAT GRACE HARLOWE WATCHED THE TREND THAT AFFAIRS WERE TAKING WITH CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY
IT IS WONDERFUL TO FEEL THAT ONE IS ABLE TO FORGET ONE'S SELF AND BECOME SOME ONE ELSE BUT IT IS MORE WONDERFUL TO MAKE ONE'S AUDIENCE FEEL IT TOO TO HAVE THEM FORGET THAT ONE IS ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LIVING BREATHING PERSON WHOSE CHARACTER ONE IS TRYING TO PORTRAY
AND YOU CAN WIN PLENTY OF APPLAUSE PLAYING IT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT ONCE HAVING GIVEN OUT A PART I SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT FROM THE GIRL I HAD GIVEN IT TO SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME OTHER GIRL DESIRED IT THAT WOULD BE BOTH UNFAIR AND UNJUST
THEY SEEM POSSESSED WITH IMPS THE PHI SIGMA TAU GIRLS AND A FEW OF THE GRINDS ARE REALLY THE ONLY ONES WHO BEHAVE LATELY IT'S LARGELY DUE TO ELEANOR I THINK REPLIED ANNE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME QUITE A POWER AMONG SOME OF THE GIRLS IN THE CLASS
WHO SWAYED TO AND FRO IN HER ROCKER HE WAS INTENTLY CONSCIOUS OF RUTH'S WHITE FIGURE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL
STOOD AWAITING HER REPLY I SHOULD LIKE TO DO THAT ELEANOR SAID SLOWLY A CURIOUS LIGHT IN HER EYES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS TEBBS
AND WENT ABOUT MAKING MYSTERIOUS SIGNS TO EACH OTHER WHENEVER THEY MET THE VERY NAME OF THE SOCIETY WAS SHROUDED IN MYSTERY THOUGH NORA O'MALLEY WAS HEARD TO DECLARE THAT SHE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A BRANCH OF THE BLACK HAND
WITH NUMEROUS ADDITIONS FAR FROM PLEASING TO HER SHE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY AND AT ONCE LAID THE MATTER AT GRACE'S DOOR WHILE HER ANIMOSITY TOWARD GRACE GREW DAILY BUT GRACE WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT ELEANOR DISLIKED
HIS FINGERS CLOSED SOFTLY TIGHTLY OVER HERS SHE HEARD HIM SAY ALMOST INAUDIBLY TILL MONDAY SHE RAISED HER SHY EYES FOR ONE BRIEF SECOND TO HIS GLOWING ONES AND HE PASSED A TALL DARK FIGURE DOWN THE SHADOWY ROAD
NOW WHEN HE DECIDEDLY OBJECTED TO MOVING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARTLESS NOT TO GO DON'T CONSIDER ME SAID THE DOCTOR OBSERVING HIS HESITANCY IF IT ILL RELIEVE YOU I ASSURE YOU I SHALL NOT MISS YOU IN THE LEAST GO RIGHT AHEAD JULES URGED HIS WIFE
THEN STOPPED AND TURNING HER BACK UPON THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEGAN TALKING TO EDNA WRIGHT JUST THEN MISS TEBBS WHO HAD BEEN BUSY WITH HER LIST ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD NOW NAME THE CAST AND ALL CONVERSATION CEASED AS BY MAGIC
ANNE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE MORE LOVE FOR THE STAGE THAN YOU WILL ADMIT SAID GRACE LAUGHING YOU ARE ALL TAKEN UP WITH THE IDEA OF THIS PLAY IF ONE COULD LIVE IN THE SAME ATMOSPHERE AS THAT OF HOME THEN THERE COULD BE NO PROFESSION MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN THAT OF THE ACTOR REPLIED ANNE THOUGHTFULLY
IF DOCTOR KEMP WISHED TO ROW HE SHOULD ROW AND SINCE THE JEWISH MISSUS GRUNDY WAS NOT ON HAND ANYTHING HARMLESSLY ENJOYABLE WAS PERMISSIBLE RUTH WENT INDOORS THIS WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR
NO SHE ANSWERED A LITTLE BREATHLESSLY I BELIEVE I AM GROWING FAR SIGHTED IT MUST BE TIME TO SIGHT HOME NOW SAID HER MOTHER I AM QUITE CHILLY
SOME MERRY ROWERS DOWN THE RIVER WERE SINGING COLLEGE SONGS HARMONIOUSLY
DOCTOR KEMP MOVED QUIETLY BACK TO HIS FORMER POSITION FAR ACROSS THE RIVER A WOMAN'S SILVERY VOICE WAS SINGING THE SWEET OLD LOVE SONG JUANITA OVERHEAD THE GOLDEN CRESCENT MOON HUNG LOW FROM THE FLOOR OF HEAVEN PULSATING WITH STARS
NO OTHER GIRLS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NORA HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO READ AS MUCH OF ANY SCENE AS THEY TWO HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO READ BUT ELEANOR HAD RECKONED WITHOUT HER HOST FOR THERE WAS ONE GIRL WHO HAD NOT AS YET COME TO THE FRONT
I SHALL TRY AWFULLY HARD FOR A PART EVEN IF IT IS ONLY TWO LINES SAID ANNE EARNESTLY I WONDER WHAT PLAY IS TO BE CHOSEN AND IF IT IS TO BE GIVEN FOR THE SCHOOL ONLY
THE GIRL WAS ANNE PIERSON WHO IN SOME MYSTERIOUS MANNER HAD BEEN ALL BUT OVERLOOKED UNTIL MISS TEBBS SPIED HER STANDING BETWEEN GRACE AND NORA CAN YOU SPARE US A MOMENT MORE MISTER SOUTHARD SAID MISS TEBBS TO THE ACTOR WHO WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE
SLEEP WITH THIS NEW CROWN UPON HER HUMBLE AS THE BEAUTIFUL BEGGAR MAID MUST HAVE FELT WHEN THE KING RAISED HER SHE WONDERED WHY SHE HAD BEEN THUS CHOSEN BY ONE WHOM SHE HAD DEEMED SO IMMEASURABLY ABOVE HER
MIRIAM NESBIT WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE DUKE WHILE MARIAN BARBER WAS TO PLAY FREDERICK HIS BROTHER JESSICA WAS IN RAPTURES OVER PHEBE WHILE NORA HAD CAPTURED TOUCHSTONE EVA ALLEN AUDREY AND TO HER GREAT DELIGHT
A DIRECT SLAP IN THE FACE COULD SCARCELY HAVE CONVEYED GREATER INSULT THAN DID THAT ONE INSOLENT GLANCE THE PRINCIPAL WAS AT A LOSS AS TO ITS IMPORT SHE WISELY DECIDED TO IGNORE IT BUT STORED IT UP IN HER MEMORY FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
AND SEEMED STRIVING TO OUTDO THE NIGHT IN BRILLIANCY FOR A WHILE KEMP MAINTAINED A SORT OF ROLAND FOR AN OLIVER CONVERSATION WITH HER BUT WITH HIS EYES CONTINUALLY STRAYING TO THE GIRL BEFORE HIM IT BECAME RATHER DIFFICULT
THIS IS A VERITABLE LAND OF MILK AND HONEY COME UP AND LISTEN TO MY WIFE RHAPSODIZE HOW IS SHE HE ASKED TURNING WITH HIM AND CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF RUTH'S VANISHING FIGURE
KEMP GRASPED HIS HAND HEARTILY I AM A SORT OF SURPRISE PARTY HE ANSWERED SWINGING ETHEL TO THE GROUND AND WATCHING HER SCAMPER OFF TO THE HOTEL AND WHAT IS MORE HE CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM I HAVE NOT BROUGHT A HAMPER WHICH MAKES ONE OF ME
THERE GOES ELEANOR AFTER MISS TEBBS OBSERVED MARIAN BARBER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE'S UP TO NOW OH NEVER MIND HER SAID NORA IMPATIENTLY YOU'LL SEE ENOUGH OF HER DURING REHEARSAL IT WILL BE SO PLEASANT TO REHEARSE WITH HER
WHO MADE AN ENTRY ON HER PAD AND BECKONED TO THE GIRL NEXT TO MARIAN TO COME FORWARD STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE HE WENT SOMETIMES STOPPING A GIRL AT HER THIRD OR FOURTH LINE RARELY ALLOWING THEM TO READ FARTHER THAN THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD OF ALL MY GLOWING COMPLIMENTS ON YOUR ROWING AND I WAS TELLING YOUR MOTHER THAT IN ALL MODESTY I WAS CONSIDERED A FINE OAR AT MY ALMA MATER
BUT SHE WAS RATHER STARTLED WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT KEMP WAS ADDRESSING HER I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW MY PROWESS TO YOU MISS LEVICE IN WHAT SHE ASKED SOMEWHAT DAZED RUTH RUTH LAUGHED HER MOTHER
SHE WOULD MEET AND ANSWER EVERY ONE OF HIS LONG GLANCES IN KIND SHE WOUND A BLACK LACE SHAWL AROUND HER HEAD AND WITH SOME WRAPS FOR HER MOTHER CAME OUT HADN'T YOU BETTER PUT SOMETHING OVER YOUR SHOULDERS HE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY AS SHE APPEARED
LIKE MAUD ADAMS OR ETHEL BARRYMORE THEN THAT IS DIFFERENT SHE IS PRACTICALLY BORN BRED AND BROUGHT UP IN THE THEATRE SHE IS AS CAREFULLY GUARDED AS THOUGH SHE LIVED IN A LITTLE VILLAGE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE KNOWS FROM BABYHOOD ALL THE UNPLEASANT FEATURES OF THE PROFESSION
THE JUNIORS WILL GET THE REPUTATION AMONG THE TEACHERS THIS YEAR THAT THE JUNIOR CLASS HAD LAST AND IT SEEMS SUCH A PITY I OVERHEARD MISS CHESTER TELL MISS KANE THE OTHER DAY
HER HEAD WAS LEANING AGAINST THE FLAG STAFF
AS HE PUT ONE FOOT IN AFTER SHOVING IT OFF
THAT HER JUNIOR CLASSES WERE THE MOST TRYING OF THE DAY BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK HARDER TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE THAN TO TEACH HER SUBJECT THAT'S A NICE REPUTATION TO CARRY AROUND ISN'T IT REMARKED NORA INDIGNANTLY BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS TO TRY HARDER THAN EVER TO MAKE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY
LONG GENTLE STROKES TOUCHED THE WATER AND PRESENTLY THE OARS LAY IDLE IN THEIR LOCKS THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUSLY DRIFTING THE WATER DIPPED AND LAPPED ABOUT THE SIDES THE TENDER WOMAN'S VOICE ACROSS THE WATER STOLE TO THEM
I AM SURE ROSALIND WILL BE SAFE WITH YOU
THAT EDNA WRIGHT HAD BEEN THE ORIGINAL PURVEYOR OF THE NEWS AND IN THIS SHE WAS RIGHT EDNA HAD UNDER PLEDGE OF SECRECY TOLD IT TO A SOPHOMORE WHO IMMEDIATELY TOLD IT TO HER DEAREST FRIEND AND SO THE TALE TRAVELED UNTIL IT REACHED ELEANOR
AS YET CORRECTED KEMP THEN WILL YOU WRAP SOMETHING ABOUT YOU AND COME DOWN TO THE RIVER CERTAINLY SHE WILL ANSWERED HER MOTHER RUN IN AND GET SOME WRAPS RUTH YOU WILL COME TOO MAMMA OF COURSE BUT CONSIDERING DOCTOR KEMP'S LENGTH
I TOLD YOU SHE'D SULK IF SHE COULDN'T BE THE LEADING LADY GRACE GLANCED OVER TOWARD ELEANOR WHO STOOD BITING HER LIP HER HANDS CLENCHED AND HER FACE SET IN ANGRY LINES SHE LOOKS LIKE THE VENDETTA OR THE CAMORRA
READ THIS HE SAID BRIEFLY HOLDING OUT THE BOOK TO NORA NORA BEGAN AND READ GLIBLY ON UNCONSCIOUSLY EMPHASIZING AS SHE DID SO DOWN ONE PAGE SHE READ AND HALF WAY THROUGH THE NEXT BEFORE MISTER SOUTHARD SEEMED SATISFIED
WHO WOULD FOLLOW HER ABOUT LIKE SHEEP AND IT WAS OVER THESE GIRLS THAT GRACE FELT WORRIED IF ELEANOR WERE TO ORGANIZE AND CARRY OUT ANY MALICIOUS PIECE OF MISCHIEF AND THEY WERE IMPLICATED THEY WOULD ALL HAVE TO SUFFER FOR WHAT SHE WOULD BE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE
I DON'T BELIEVE THEIR SOCIETY WILL LAST LONG AT ANY RATE THOSE GIRLS ARE SURE TO QUARREL AMONG THEMSELVES AND THAT WILL END THE WHOLE THING OR THEY MAY GO TOO FAR AND HAVE MISS THOMPSON TO RECKON WITH AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY COOL THEIR ARDOR O GIRLS EXCLAIMED GRACE
OR SOME OTHER ITALIAN VENGEANCE AGENCY DOESN'T SHE SAID NORA WITH A GIGGLE GRACE LAUGHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF AT NORA'S REMARK BUT REGRETTED IT THE NEXT MOMENT FOR ELEANOR SAW THE GLANCES DIRECTED TOWARD HER AND HEARD NORA'S GIGGLE
SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THE EASY MOTION OF HIS FIGURE AS HE ROWED LIGHTLY DOWN THE RIVER HIS FLANNEL SHIRT LOW AT THE THROAT SHOWED HIS STRONG WHITE NECK RISING LIKE A COLUMN FROM HIS BROAD SHOULDERS
NORA WAS THE SECOND PHI SIGMA TAU TO UNDERGO THE ORDEAL AS SHE BRISKLY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINES THE ACTOR STOPPED HER TAKING THE BOOK FROM HER HE TURNED TO THE PART WHERE TOUCHSTONE QUAINTLY HUMOROUS HOLDS FORTH UPON THE LIE SEVEN TIMES REMOVED
EVER IN THE AFTER TIME WHEN RUTH HEARD THAT SONG SHE WAS AGAIN ROCKING IN THE FRAIL ROW BOAT UPON THE LOVELY RIVER AND A MAN'S DEEP GRAVE EYES HELD HERS AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER LET THEM GO
SHE LEANED A LITTLE FARTHER FORWARD LOOKING PAST KEMP MAMMA THEN SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF BACK IN HER SEAT
THE CRICKETS CHIRPED IN THE HEDGES NOW AND THEN A FIREFLY FLASHED BEFORE THEM
HE GENTLY LIFTED HER RESISTING FINGERS ONE BY ONE AND RAISED THE BROAD BONE OF CONTENTION TO HIS SHOULDER
THE SORORITY THAT ELEANOR HAD MENTIONED IN HER LETTER TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WAS NOW IN FULL FLOWER THE SEVEN GIRLS WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE OMNIBUS HOUSE WERE THE CHOSEN MEMBERS THEY WORE PINS IN THE SHAPE OF SKULLS AND CROSS BONES
THE BALMY SUMMER FREIGHTED AIR MADE HER FEEL DROWSY SHE LISTENED ABSENTLY TO RUTH'S OCCASIONAL WARNINGS TO KEMP AND TO THE SWIFT DIP OF THE OARS NOW WE HAVE CLEAR SAILING FOR A STRETCH SAID RUTH AS THEY CAME TO A BROAD CURVE
THEY EXPECTED HER TO LIVE UP TO HER REPUTATION AND SHE HAD SCARCELY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINE BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT SHE WOULD NOT DISAPPOINT THEM HER MUSICAL VOICE VIBRATED WITH EXPRESSION
HE HARDLY APPRECIATED WHAT AN ADMIRABLE AIDE HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM IN HIS WIFE KEMP SAT UPON THE TOP STEP AND LEANED HIS BACK AGAINST THE RAILING
YOU WILL REPORT FOR REHEARSAL NEXT TUESDAY AFTERNOON AFTER SCHOOL WHEN TYPEWRITTEN COPIES OF YOUR PARTS WILL BE HANDED YOU SAID MISS TEBBS AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE ROOM THE MOMENT MISS TEBBS CEASED TALKING THE GIRLS BEGAN AS THEY GATHERED IN LITTLE GROUPS AROUND THE LUCKY ONES
SHE ATE A HEARTY MEAL AND THAT RUTH WHO WAS UNUSUALLY QUIET TASTED SCARCELY ANYTHING HER FATHER ALSO OBSERVED IT AND RESOLVED UPON A COURSE OF STRICT SURVEILLANCE HE WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE ON THE EARLY MORNING'S TRAIN
ELEANOR OVERTOOK MISS TEBBS JUST OUTSIDE MISS THOMPSON'S OFFICE I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU MISS TEBBS SAID ELEANOR AS THE TEACHER PAUSED HER HAND ON THE DOORKNOB WELL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU MISS SAVELL I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE PLAY
THAT IS NO HINDRANCE TO MY VOLUBILITY I AM GLAD TO SAY A BACK IS NOT VERY INSPIRING OR EXPRESSIVE BUT RUTH CAN TELL ME WHEN YOU LOOK BORED IF I WAX TOO DISCURSIVE IT WAS A TINY BOAT
IF I AM ANYWHERE NEAR HERE WHEN YOUR PLAY IS ENACTED I SHALL MAKE IT A POINT TO COME AND SEE IT SHAKING HANDS WARMLY WITH MISS TEBBS AND BOWING TO THE ADMIRING GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD HURRIEDLY DEPARTED LEAVING HIS AUDIENCE DEVOURED WITH CURIOSITY AS TO THE CHOSEN ONES
THEN HE AGAIN HELD CONVERSATION WITH MISS TEBBS WHO NODDED AND LOOKED SMILINGLY TOWARD NORA WHO STOOD SCOWLING FAINTLY RATHER ILL PLEASED AT ATTRACTING SO MUCH ATTENTION
WHISPERED JESSICA TO GRACE WHO WAS ABOUT TO REPLY WHEN MISTER SOUTHARD MOTIONED TO HER GRACE WHO KNEW THE SCENE BY HEART WENT FEARLESSLY FORWARD AND READ THE LINES WITH SPLENDID EMPHASIS MARIAN AND EVA ALLEN FOLLOWED HER
THERE IS TALK OF GIVING A SHAKESPEARIAN PLAY WITH MISS TEBBS TO ENGINEER IT AND THE CAST TO BE CHOSEN FROM THE THREE LOWER CLASSES THE SENIORS OF COURSE WILL GIVE THEIR OWN PLAY LATER HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ASKED ANNE MISS THOMPSON HERSELF TOLD ME ABOUT IT REPLIED GRACE
HARDLY A RECITATION PASSES IN MY CLASS
JUST AS THAT TEACHER HAD OBSERVED HER AS MOST OF THE GIRLS PRESENT HAD HEARD ANNE RECITE
A THIRD IN YOUR LITTLE BOAT WILL BE THE PROVERBIAL TRUMPERY STILL I SUPPOSE I CAN RELY ON YOU TWO CRACK OARSMEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE SLIGHTEST TREMBLE IN THE BOAT IN THE FAIREST WEATHER IS LIKELY TO CREATE A SQUALL ON MY PART
SHE CERTAINLY WILL SAID NORA BUT TO GIVE THE PLAY A REST AND COME DOWN TO EVERYDAY AFFAIRS WHERE SHALL WE MEET TO GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAME LET ME SEE SAID GRACE THE GAME IS TO BE CALLED AT THREE O'CLOCK
FATHER SAYS HE HAS AT LAST SCARED UP TWO OTHER GENTLEMEN AND WILL YOU PLEASE COME OVER AND PLAY A RUBBER OF WHIST MISTER LEVICE FELT HIMSELF A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES HE AND MISTER TYRRELL HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A COUPLE OF OPPONENTS AND HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP THE SEARCH
HOW COULD HER MOTHER BE SO BLIND AS NOT TO KNOW OR FEEL HER DESIRE TO EVADE DOCTOR KEMP SHE FELT A POSITIVE CONTEMPT FOR HERSELF THAT HIS PRESENCE SHOULD AFFECT HER AS IT DID SHE DARED NOT LOOK AT HIM LEST HER HEART SHOULD FLUTTER TO HER EYES
AND THE SLIGHT WHITE FIGURE STOOD STILL TILL THEY CAME UP YOU ARE SO SLOW SHE SAID WITH A RECKLESS LITTLE LAUGH I FEEL AS IF I COULD FLY HOME ARE YOU LIGHT HEADED RUTH ASKED HER MOTHER BUT THE GIRL HAD FALLEN BEHIND THEM
THIS OF ITSELF WILL BRING A SOFTNESS INTO A MAN'S MANNER AND WITHOUT DOUBT HIS FEARS HAD BEEN GROUNDLESS FEARS THAT HE HAD NOT DARED TO PUT INTO WORDS FOR OLD MAN AS HE WAS HE REALIZED THAT DOCTOR KEMP'S STRONG PERSONALITY
SHE SCARCELY SEEMED TO BREATHE SO STILL SHE SAT HER SLENDER HANDS LOOSELY CLASPED IN HER LAP DOCTOR KEMP SAT OPPOSITE HER AND MISSUS LEVICE SLEPT SLOWLY AND MORE SLOWLY SPED THE TINY BOAT
HE PROTESTED AT SUCH A STUPENDOUS COMPARISON AND INSISTED THAT SHE MAKE CLEAR THAT THE DUMMY WAS NOT INCLUDED THE SHORT AFTERNOON GLIDED INTO EVENING AND DOCTOR KEMP WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL AND DINED AT THE LEVICES TABLE
AND WERE ENJOYING THE BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT WHEN WILL TYRRELL PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THEM GOOD EVENING HE SAID TAKING OFF HIS HAT AS HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS
THE PLAY HASN'T BEEN DECIDED UPON YET REPLIED GRACE BUT THE OBJECT OF IT IS TO GET SOME MONEY FOR NEW BOOKS FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARY THE PLAN IS TO CHARGE FIFTY CENTS A PIECE FOR THE TICKETS AND TO GIVE EACH GIRL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEM TO SELL
FROM THE DAY THAT MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN HER TO TASK FOR ABSENCE SHE HAD ENTERTAINED A SUPREME CONTEMPT FOR THE PRINCIPAL OF WHICH MISS THOMPSON WAS WHOLLY UNAWARE UNTIL ENCOUNTERING ELEANOR ONE MORNING IN THE CORRIDOR
OTHERS ARE ENJOYING THEMSELVES ALSO HE REMARKED AS THEIR FEET TOUCHED THE PEBBLY BEACH A FAINT CRESCENT MOON SHONE OVER THE WATER RUTH WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LITTLE BOAT AGROUND ON THE SHORE IT LOOKS LIKE A COCKLE SHELL HE SAID
WHEN I COMPARE MY LIFE BEFORE I CAME HERE WITH THE GOOD TIMES I HAVE HAD SINCE I MET YOU GIRLS I HATE THE VERY IDEA OF THE STAGE ONLY SHE CONCLUDED WITH A SHAME FACED AIR THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE DESIRE TO ACT IS IRRESISTIBLE
SHE HANDED THE BOOK BACK WITH AN AIR OF STUDIED INDIFFERENCE SHE WAS FAR FROM FEELING SHE HAD DECIDED IN HER OWN MIND THAT ROSALIND WAS THE PART BEST SUITED TO HER AND FELT THAT THE HONOR NOW LAY BETWEEN HERSELF AND GRACE
PROBABLY THE DISPLAY AMUSED HIM WHAT WAS SHE TO HIM ANYWAY BUT A GIRL WITH WHOM HE COULD FLIRT IN HIS IDLE MOMENTS WELL WITH A PASSIONATE FLING OF HER ARMS SHE WOULD EXTINGUISH HER UNCONTROLLABLE LITTLE BEATER FOR THE NONCE
THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE WAS TELLING A FIB HAD YOU HEARD REBECCA FIRST I GIVE MISS SHARP WARNING THOUGH SAID OSBORNE THAT RIGHT OR WRONG I CONSIDER MISS AMELIA SEDLEY THE FIRST SINGER IN THE WORLD YOU SHALL HEAR SAID AMELIA
O JOSEPH WE KNOW THAT STORY SAID AMELIA LAUGHING NEVER MIND ABOUT TELLING THAT BUT PERSUADE MAMMA TO WRITE TO SIR SOMETHING CRAWLEY FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR POOR DEAR REBECCA HERE SHE COMES HER EYES RED WITH WEEPING I'M BETTER NOW SAID THE GIRL WITH
AT WHICH SPEECH EVEN MISTER SAMBO AT THE SIDEBOARD BURST OUT LAUGHING AND POOR FAT JOE FELT INCLINED TO BECOME A PARRICIDE ALMOST UNDO HIS STAYS CONTINUED THE PITILESS OLD GENTLEMAN
BUT THERE WAS NO LETTER DO THEY TALK THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS AT BOGGLEY WOLLAH SEDLEY ASKED OSBORNE LAUGHING POOH NONSENSE REPLIED THE SENTIMENTAL YOUTH BOUGHT EM AT NATHAN'S VERY GLAD YOU LIKE EM
IN A WORD GEORGE WAS AS FAMILIAR WITH THE FAMILY AS SUCH DAILY ACTS OF KINDNESS AND INTERCOURSE COULD MAKE HIM DO YOU REMEMBER SEDLEY WHAT A FURY YOU WERE IN WHEN I CUT OFF THE TASSELS OF YOUR HESSIAN BOOTS AND HOW MISS HEM
AND AT THIS MOMENT MISTER SAMBO MADE HIS APPEARANCE WITH A TRAY CONTAINING SANDWICHES JELLIES AND SOME GLITTERING GLASSES AND DECANTERS ON WHICH JOSEPH SEDLEY'S ATTENTION WAS IMMEDIATELY FIXED
WAS ONE OF THE DEFECTS OF THIS SILLY LITTLE THING GEORGE OSBORNE LOOKED AT THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN WITH A TOUCHED CURIOSITY AND JOSEPH SEDLEY HEAVED SOMETHING VERY LIKE A SIGH OUT OF HIS BIG CHEST
THAT EVERYBODY FELT HOW CRUEL HER LOT WAS AND HOW SORRY THEY WOULD BE TO PART WITH HER O THAT YOU COULD STAY LONGER DEAR REBECCA SAID AMELIA WHY ANSWERED THE OTHER STILL MORE SADLY
AND ACTUALLY HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK MISS REBECCA FOR WHOM SHE WAS KNITTING THE GREEN SILK PURSE HE WAS QUITE SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED AT HIS OWN GRACEFUL FAMILIAR MANNER
THE PETITION TOO FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE YOUNG LADY'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE HAD ALREADY BEEN DESPATCHED AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A PRETEXT FOR ABRUPTLY DISMISSING HER AND AS IF ALL THINGS CONSPIRED IN FAVOUR OF THE GENTLE REBECCA THE VERY ELEMENTS
SIR AND MISTER SAMBO TO THE DELIGHT OF THAT ATTENDANT
AND JOSEPH SEDLEY WAS ACTUALLY POLITE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE CANDLES TO THE PIANO OSBORNE HINTED THAT HE SHOULD LIKE QUITE AS WELL TO SIT IN THE DARK BUT MISS SEDLEY LAUGHING DECLINED TO BEAR HIM COMPANY ANY FARTHER
BONEY HIMSELF HASN'T GOT SUCH IN HIS CELLAR MY BOY A GOBLET OF CHAMPAGNE RESTORED JOSEPH'S EQUANIMITY AND BEFORE THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTIED OF WHICH AS AN INVALID HE TOOK TWO THIRDS HE HAD AGREED TO TAKE THE YOUNG LADIES TO VAUXHALL
AT THIS I DON'T KNOW IN THE LEAST FOR WHAT REASON MISSUS SEDLEY LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND AND LAUGHED MISTER SEDLEY'S EYES TWINKLED IN A MANNER INDESCRIBABLY ROGUISH AND HE LOOKED AT AMELIA AND AMELIA HANGING DOWN HER HEAD
BUT JOS WAS LEFT ALONE WITH REBECCA WHO HAD RESUMED HER WORK AND THE GREEN SILK AND THE SHINING NEEDLES WERE QUIVERING RAPIDLY UNDER HER WHITE SLENDER FINGERS WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
AND THAT A WOMAN OF YOUR YEARS AND SIZE IS TO CATCH COLD IN SUCH AN ABOMINABLE DAMP PLACE THE CHILDREN MUST HAVE SOMEONE WITH THEM CRIED MISSUS SEDLEY LET JOE GO SAID HIS FATHER LAUGHING HE'S BIG ENOUGH
AND SMELT THEM DELICATELY AND HELD THEM TO HER BOSOM AND CAST UP HER EYES TO THE CEILING IN AN ECSTASY OF ADMIRATION PERHAPS SHE JUST LOOKED FIRST INTO THE BOUQUET TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS A BILLET DOUX HIDDEN AMONG THE FLOWERS
BLUSHED AS ONLY YOUNG LADIES OF SEVENTEEN KNOW HOW TO BLUSH
YET SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SUPPOSE THAT THE LITTLE HUMBLE GRATEFUL GENTLE GOVERNESS WOULD DARE TO LOOK UP TO SUCH A MAGNIFICENT PERSONAGE AS THE COLLECTOR OF BOGGLEY WOLLAH
SO YOU KNOW SHE THE POOR CHILD IS ALL HEART SAID MISSUS SEDLEY I WISH SHE COULD STAY WITH US ANOTHER WEEK SAID AMELIA SHE'S DEVILISH LIKE MISS CUTLER THAT I USED TO MEET AT DUMDUM ONLY FAIRER
THOUGH FOR THE MATTER OF THAT THE COUPLE IN THE NEXT APARTMENT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DISTURBED HAD THE TALKING BEEN EVER SO LOUD SO OCCUPIED WERE THEY WITH THEIR OWN PURSUITS ALMOST FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE MISTER SEDLEY FOUND HIMSELF TALKING
ORDER MISTER JOS'S ELEPHANT SAMBO CRIED THE FATHER SEND TO EXETER CHANGE SAMBO BUT SEEING JOS READY ALMOST TO CRY WITH VEXATION THE OLD JOKER STOPPED HIS LAUGHTER AND SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HIS SON
HOW DELIGHTED MISS REBECCA WAS AT THE GOVERNMENT BALLS AND HOW SHE LAUGHED AT THE STORIES OF THE SCOTCH AIDES DE CAMP AND CALLED MISTER SEDLEY A SAD WICKED SATIRICAL CREATURE AND HOW FRIGHTENED SHE WAS AT THE STORY OF THE ELEPHANT
OVER AGAIN AS SHE CAME TO THE LAST WORDS MISS SHARP'S DEEP TONED VOICE FALTERED EVERYBODY FELT THE ALLUSION TO HER DEPARTURE AND TO HER HAPLESS ORPHAN STATE JOSEPH SEDLEY WHO WAS FOND OF MUSIC AND SOFT HEARTED
IN SMALL CHANGE HAVING EXPENDED HER LITTLE STORE OF SONGS OR HAVING STAYED LONG ENOUGH IN THE BACK DRAWING ROOM IT NOW APPEARED PROPER TO MISS AMELIA TO ASK HER FRIEND TO SING YOU WOULD NOT HAVE LISTENED TO ME SHE SAID TO MISTER OSBORNE
NO YOU MISS SHARP MY DEAR MISS SHARP DO SING IT NOT NOW MISTER SEDLEY SAID REBECCA WITH A SIGH MY SPIRITS ARE NOT EQUAL TO IT BESIDES I MUST FINISH THE PURSE WILL YOU HELP ME MISTER SEDLEY
DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING LIKE YOUR BROTHER'S ELOQUENCE WHISPERED MISTER OSBORNE TO AMELIA WHY YOUR FRIEND HAS WORKED MIRACLES THE MORE THE BETTER SAID MISS AMELIA WHO LIKE ALMOST ALL WOMEN WHO ARE WORTH A PIN
A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE AND INTIMACY IS PRESENTLY ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM THERE IS NO NEED OF GIVING A SPECIAL REPORT OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH NOW TOOK PLACE BETWEEN MISTER SEDLEY AND THE YOUNG LADY FOR THE CONVERSATION AS MAY BE JUDGED FROM THE FOREGOING SPECIMEN
AND WHAT A SENSATION SHE WOULD MAKE AT THE CALCUTTA BALLS IT'S EVIDENT THE POOR DEVIL'S IN LOVE WITH ME THOUGHT HE SHE IS JUST AS RICH AS MOST OF THE GIRLS WHO COME OUT TO INDIA
AS HE CAST HIS EYES DOWN TOWARDS HIS FAVOURITE HESSIAN BOOTS LET US HAVE SOME MUSIC MISS SEDLEY AMELIA SAID GEORGE
SOSPIRI AND FELICITA OF THE ETERNAL DONIZETTIAN MUSIC WITH WHICH WE ARE FAVOURED NOW A DAYS CONVERSATION OF A SENTIMENTAL SORT BEFITTING THE SUBJECT WAS CARRIED ON BETWEEN THE SONGS TO WHICH SAMBO AFTER HE HAD BROUGHT THE TEA
I EXACTLY BEGIN TO FEEL AS I DID AT DUMDUM WITH MISS CUTLER MANY SWEET LITTLE APPEALS HALF TENDER HALF JOCULAR DID MISS SHARP MAKE TO HIM ABOUT THE DISHES AT DINNER FOR BY THIS TIME SHE WAS ON A FOOTING OF CONSIDERABLE FAMILIARITY WITH THE FAMILY
AND BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO ASK HOW MISTER JOSEPH SEDLEY OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY'S SERVICE WAS ACTUALLY SEATED TETE A TETE WITH A YOUNG LADY LOOKING AT HER WITH A MOST KILLING EXPRESSION
I WAS UPON MY HONOUR GOLLOP MY DOCTOR CAME IN AT ELEVEN FOR I'M A SAD INVALID YOU KNOW AND SEE GOLLOP EVERY DAY AND GAD THERE I WAS SINGING AWAY LIKE A ROBIN O YOU DROLL CREATURE DO LET ME HEAR YOU SING IT
SEDLEY SHALL BE REPRESENTED IN BUCKSKINS AND HOLDING ONE OF THE INJURED BOOTS IN ONE HAND BY THE OTHER HE SHALL HAVE HOLD OF MY SHIRT FRILL AMELIA SHALL BE KNEELING NEAR HIM WITH HER LITTLE HANDS UP AND THE PICTURE SHALL HAVE A GRAND ALLEGORICAL TITLE
MISSUS SEDLEY TOOK HER HUSBAND TO TASK FOR HIS CRUEL CONDUCT TO POOR JOE IT WAS QUITE WICKED OF YOU MISTER SEDLEY SAID SHE TO TORMENT THE POOR BOY SO MY DEAR SAID THE COTTON TASSEL IN DEFENCE OF HIS CONDUCT
THE DELIGHTED COOK AND EVEN MISSUS BLENKINSOP THE HOUSEKEEPER CONDESCENDED TO LISTEN ON THE LANDING PLACE AMONG THESE DITTIES WAS ONE THE LAST OF THE CONCERT AND TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT AH
AH LOUD AND PIERCING WAS THE STORM THE COTTAGE ROOF WAS SHELTER'D SURE
AMELIA HAD BETTER WRITE A NOTE SAID HER FATHER AND LET GEORGE OSBORNE SEE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HANDWRITING WE HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM MISS PINKERTON'S
HE HAD NEVER BEEN BUT ONCE AT A TIGER HUNT WHEN THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED AND WHEN HE WAS HALF KILLED NOT BY THE TIGER BUT BY THE FRIGHT AND AS HE TALKED ON HE GREW QUITE BOLD
IT'S A MERCY HE DID NOT BRING US OVER A BLACK DAUGHTER IN LAW MY DEAR BUT MARK MY WORDS THE FIRST WOMAN WHO FISHES FOR HIM HOOKS HIM SHE SHALL GO OFF TO MORROW THE LITTLE ARTFUL CREATURE SAID MISSUS SEDLEY WITH GREAT ENERGY
WITHOUT THE LEAST TIMIDITY OR HESITATION TO A PERSON OF THE OTHER SEX MISS REBECCA ASKED HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT INDIA WHICH GAVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF NARRATING MANY INTERESTING ANECDOTES ABOUT THAT COUNTRY AND HIMSELF
NOTHING COULD INDUCE HER FRIEND TO GO WITHOUT HER WHAT YOU WHO HAVE SHOWN THE POOR ORPHAN WHAT HAPPINESS AND LOVE ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE QUIT YOU NEVER AND THE GREEN EYES LOOKED UP TO HEAVEN AND FILLED WITH TEARS
FOR YOUR MOTHER'S SAKE DEAR MISTER SEDLEY SHE SAID
WHO FELT AT THAT MOMENT AN EXTRAORDINARY ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TO SEIZE THE ABOVE MENTIONED YOUNG WOMAN IN HIS ARMS AND TO KISS HER IN THE FACE OF THE COMPANY AND SHE LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT
THE GIRLS MUST HAVE A GENTLEMAN APIECE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN JOS WILL BE SURE TO LEAVE EMMY IN THE CROWD
AND AS FOR AMELIA I THINK SHE WAS MORE FRIGHTENED THAN EVEN THE PEOPLE MOST CONCERNED SAMBO WHO FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER JOSEPH FOLLOWED GRINNING IN THE COLLECTOR'S REAR
THOSE TWO HAVE TOLD THEIRS AS SOON AS HE GETS HIS COMPANY SAID JOSEPH I BELIEVE THE AFFAIR IS SETTLED GEORGE OSBORNE IS A CAPITAL FELLOW AND YOUR SISTER THE DEAREST CREATURE IN THE WORLD SAID REBECCA
JOS INSTANTLY RELAPSED INTO AN ALARMED SILENCE AND QUICKLY TOOK HIS DEPARTURE HE DID NOT LIE AWAKE ALL NIGHT THINKING WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH MISS SHARP THE PASSION OF LOVE NEVER INTERFERED WITH THE APPETITE OR THE SLUMBER OF MISTER JOSEPH SEDLEY
WHEN THE PARENTS OF THE HOUSE OF SEDLEY RETURNED FROM THEIR DINNER PARTY THEY FOUND THE YOUNG PEOPLE SO BUSY IN TALKING THAT THEY HAD NOT HEARD THE ARRIVAL OF THE CARRIAGE AND MISTER JOSEPH WAS IN THE ACT OF SAYING
AND THAT NIGHT IN A CONVERSATION WHICH TOOK PLACE IN A FRONT ROOM IN THE SECOND FLOOR IN A SORT OF TENT HUNG ROUND WITH CHINTZ OF A RICH AND FANTASTIC INDIA PATTERN AND DOUBLE WITH CALICO OF A TENDER ROSE COLOUR
SADLY PUTTING OUT AMELIA WHO WAS WRITING TO HER TWELVE DEAREST FRIENDS AT CHISWICK MALL AND REBECCA WAS EMPLOYED UPON HER YESTERDAY'S WORK AS JOE'S BUGGY DROVE UP AND WHILE AFTER HIS USUAL THUNDERING KNOCK AND POMPOUS BUSTLE AT THE DOOR
EXERCISE THEIR POWERS OFTENER WE CAN'T RESIST THEM IF THEY DO LET THEM SHOW EVER SO LITTLE INCLINATION AND MEN GO DOWN ON THEIR KNEES AT ONCE OLD OR UGLY IT IS ALL THE SAME AND THIS I SET DOWN AS A POSITIVE TRUTH
AND IN WHICH BRITISH TARS OUR KING POOR SUSAN BLUE EYED MARY AND THE LIKE WERE THE PRINCIPAL THEMES THEY ARE NOT IT IS SAID VERY BRILLIANT IN A MUSICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT CONTAIN NUMBERLESS GOOD NATURED SIMPLE APPEALS TO THE AFFECTIONS
IN THE INTERIOR OF WHICH SPECIES OF MARQUEE WAS A FEATHERBED ON WHICH WERE TWO PILLOWS ON WHICH WERE TWO ROUND RED FACES ONE IN A LACED NIGHTCAP AND ONE IN A SIMPLE COTTON ONE ENDING IN A TASSEL
OR WERE REPLACED BY THE GENTLE BUT UNROMANTIC MUSIC OF THE NOSE AND SAVE WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS TOLLED THE HOUR AND THE WATCHMAN CALLED IT ALL WAS SILENT AT THE HOUSE OF JOHN SEDLEY ESQUIRE OF RUSSELL SQUARE AND THE STOCK EXCHANGE
BUT I'VE NO PATIENCE WITH JOS AND HIS DANDIFIED MODESTY IT IS OUT JOSEPHING JOSEPH MY DEAR AND ALL THE WHILE THE BOY IS ONLY THINKING OF HIMSELF AND WHAT A FINE FELLOW HE IS I DOUBT MA'AM WE SHALL HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH HIM YET
AND DISCOVERED A MILLION OF VIRTUES AND AMIABLE QUALITIES IN HER WHICH SHE HAD NOT PERCEIVED WHEN THEY WERE AT CHISWICK TOGETHER FOR THE AFFECTION OF YOUNG LADIES IS OF AS RAPID GROWTH AS JACK'S BEAN STALK AND REACHES UP TO THE SKY IN A NIGHT
WHEN MORNING CAME THE GOOD NATURED MISSUS SEDLEY NO LONGER THOUGHT OF EXECUTING HER THREATS WITH REGARD TO MISS SHARP FOR THOUGH NOTHING IS MORE KEEN NOR MORE COMMON NOR MORE JUSTIFIABLE THAN MATERNAL JEALOUSY
BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WOULD BE TO HEAR SUCH SONGS AS THOSE AFTER CUTCHERRY WHAT A DISTINGUEE GIRL SHE WAS HOW SHE COULD SPEAK FRENCH BETTER THAN THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S LADY HERSELF
FOR ON THE EVENING APPOINTED FOR THE VAUXHALL PARTY GEORGE OSBORNE HAVING COME TO DINNER AND THE ELDERS OF THE HOUSE HAVING DEPARTED ACCORDING TO INVITATION TO DINE WITH ALDERMAN BALLS AT HIGHBURY BARN THERE CAME ON SUCH A THUNDER STORM AS ONLY HAPPENS ON VAUXHALL NIGHTS
THE DAWN IS UP THE GUEST IS GONE THE COTTAGE HEARTH IS BLAZING STILL HEAVEN PITY ALL POOR WANDERERS LONE HARK TO THE WIND UPON THE HILL IT WAS THE SENTIMENT OF THE BEFORE MENTIONED WORDS WHEN I'M GONE
KNOWING GLANCES WERE TELEGRAPHED BETWEEN OSBORNE AND MISS SEDLEY AND THE PAIR SMILING ARCHLY LOOKED AT REBECCA WHO ACTUALLY BLUSHED AS SHE BENT HER FAIR RINGLETS OVER HER KNITTING HOW HER HEART BEAT AS JOSEPH APPEARED
YOU ARE NOT SO GOOD TO ME AS DEAR AMELIA HE DOESN'T KNOW YOU SO WELL CRIED AMELIA I DEFY ANYBODY NOT TO BE GOOD TO YOU MY DEAR SAID HER MOTHER THE CURRY WAS CAPITAL INDEED IT WAS SAID JOE QUITE GRAVELY
AND BEARING TWO HANDSOME NOSEGAYS OF FLOWERS WHICH THE MONSTER HAD ACTUALLY HAD THE GALLANTRY TO PURCHASE IN COVENT GARDEN MARKET THAT MORNING THEY WERE NOT AS BIG AS THE HAYSTACKS WHICH LADIES CARRY ABOUT WITH THEM NOW A DAYS IN CONES OF FILIGREE PAPER
NO THERE WAS NOT AND THE CHILIS
JOSEPH SEDLEY'S BACHELORHOOD WOULD HAVE BEEN AT AN END AND THIS WORK WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BUT AT THE CLOSE OF THE DITTY REBECCA QUITTED THE PIANO AND GIVING HER HAND TO AMELIA WALKED AWAY INTO THE FRONT DRAWING ROOM TWILIGHT
THE SWEETEST SMILE POSSIBLE TAKING GOOD NATURED MISSUS SEDLEY'S EXTENDED HAND AND KISSING IT RESPECTFULLY HOW KIND YOU ALL ARE TO ME ALL SHE ADDED WITH A LAUGH EXCEPT YOU MISTER JOSEPH ME SAID JOSEPH MEDITATING AN INSTANT DEPARTURE
ONCE IN LOOKING OVER SOME DRAWINGS WHICH AMELIA HAD SENT FROM SCHOOL REBECCA SUDDENLY CAME UPON ONE WHICH CAUSED HER TO BURST INTO TEARS AND LEAVE THE ROOM
IT IS WHAT SENTIMENTALISTS WHO DEAL IN VERY BIG WORDS CALL A YEARNING AFTER THE IDEAL AND SIMPLY MEANS THAT WOMEN ARE COMMONLY NOT SATISFIED UNTIL THEY HAVE HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN ON WHOM THEY MAY CENTRE AFFECTIONS WHICH ARE SPENT ELSEWHERE AS IT WERE
THAT THEY DECLARED THEY WERE RATHER GLAD OF THE THUNDER STORM THAN OTHERWISE WHICH HAD CAUSED THEM TO PUT OFF THEIR VISIT TO VAUXHALL OSBORNE WAS SEDLEY'S GODSON AND HAD BEEN ONE OF THE FAMILY ANY TIME THESE THREE AND TWENTY YEARS
A WOMAN WITH FAIR OPPORTUNITIES AND WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTE HUMP MAY MARRY WHOM SHE LIKES ONLY LET US BE THANKFUL THAT THE DARLINGS ARE LIKE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD AND DON'T KNOW THEIR OWN POWER THEY WOULD OVERCOME US ENTIRELY IF THEY DID
JOSEPH PUFFING FROM THE STAIRCASE IN SHINING CREAKING BOOTS JOSEPH IN A NEW WAISTCOAT RED WITH HEAT AND NERVOUSNESS AND BLUSHING BEHIND HIS WADDED NECKCLOTH IT WAS A NERVOUS MOMENT FOR ALL
WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED AT THIS REMARK THOUGH HE DREW HIS LEGS UNDER HIS CHAIR AS IT WAS MADE MISS SHARP SAID GEORGE OSBORNE YOU WHO ARE SO CLEVER AN ARTIST YOU MUST MAKE A GRAND HISTORICAL PICTURE OF THE SCENE OF THE BOOTS
AND IF I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY FELL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AT THAT SINGLE INSTANT OF TIME I SHOULD PERHAPS BE TELLING AN UNTRUTH FOR THE FACT IS THAT THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN BRED UP BY THEIR PARENTS FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE
PROMISE NEVER TO GO ON ONE OF THOSE HORRID EXPEDITIONS POOH POOH MISS SHARP SAID HE PULLING UP HIS SHIRT COLLARS THE DANGER MAKES THE SPORT ONLY THE PLEASANTER
FOR ANY ONE WHO WANTS A PURSE REPLIED MISS REBECCA LOOKING AT HIM IN THE MOST GENTLE WINNING WAY SEDLEY WAS GOING TO MAKE ONE OF THE MOST ELOQUENT SPEECHES POSSIBLE AND HAD BEGUN
AND AS FOR THE GIRLS THEY LOVED EACH OTHER LIKE SISTERS YOUNG UNMARRIED GIRLS ALWAYS DO IF THEY ARE IN A HOUSE TOGETHER FOR TEN DAYS AS IF BENT UPON ADVANCING REBECCA'S PLANS IN EVERY WAY WHAT MUST AMELIA DO BUT REMIND HER BROTHER OF A PROMISE MADE LAST EASTER HOLIDAYS
YES AND AFTER I HAD CUT THE TASSELS OF HIS BOOTS TOO BOYS NEVER FORGET THOSE TIPS AT SCHOOL NOR THE GIVERS I DELIGHT IN HESSIAN BOOTS SAID REBECCA JOS SEDLEY WHO ADMIRED HIS OWN LEGS PRODIGIOUSLY
AS THE FRONTISPIECES HAVE IN THE MEDULLA AND THE SPELLING BOOK I SHAN'T HAVE TIME TO DO IT HERE SAID REBECCA I'LL DO IT WHEN WHEN I'M GONE AND SHE DROPPED HER VOICE AND LOOKED SO SAD AND PITEOUS
WAS A MATCH MAKER IN HER HEART AND WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED THAT JOSEPH SHOULD CARRY BACK A WIFE TO INDIA SHE HAD TOO IN THE COURSE OF THIS FEW DAYS CONSTANT INTERCOURSE WARMED INTO A MOST TENDER FRIENDSHIP FOR REBECCA
DURING THE DRINKING OF WHICH SEDLEY TOLD A NUMBER OF HIS BEST INDIAN STORIES FOR HE WAS EXTREMELY TALKATIVE IN MAN'S SOCIETY AND AFTERWARDS MISS AMELIA SEDLEY DID THE HONOURS OF THE DRAWING ROOM AND THESE FOUR YOUNG PERSONS PASSED SUCH A COMFORTABLE EVENING TOGETHER
AMELIA HASTENED AFTER HER FRIEND TO KNOW THE CAUSE OF THIS DISPLAY OF FEELING AND THE GOOD NATURED GIRL CAME BACK WITHOUT HER COMPANION RATHER AFFECTED TOO YOU KNOW HER FATHER WAS OUR DRAWING MASTER MAMMA AT CHISWICK AND USED TO DO ALL THE BEST PARTS OF OUR DRAWINGS
AND EH AMELIA MY DEAR I BOUGHT A PINE APPLE AT THE SAME TIME WHICH I GAVE TO SAMBO LET'S HAVE IT FOR TIFFIN VERY COOL AND NICE THIS HOT WEATHER REBECCA SAID SHE HAD NEVER TASTED A PINE AND LONGED BEYOND EVERYTHING TO TASTE ONE
AND THEIR BANNS HAD AS IT WERE BEEN READ IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FAMILIES ANY TIME THESE TEN YEARS THEY WENT OFF TO THE PIANO WHICH WAS SITUATED AS PIANOS USUALLY ARE
MY LOVE I'M SURE I ALWAYS HEARD MISS PINKERTON SAY THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH THEM HE ONLY MOUNTED THEM IT WAS CALLED MOUNTING MAMMA REBECCA REMEMBERS THE DRAWING AND HER FATHER WORKING AT IT AND THE THOUGHT OF IT CAME UPON HER RATHER SUDDENLY AND
AND MISSUS SEDLEY COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT HER DAUGHTER'S FRIEND HAD A CHARMING KIND HEART OF HER OWN AS FOR MISTER SEDLEY'S JOKES REBECCA LAUGHED AT THEM WITH A CORDIALITY AND PERSEVERANCE WHICH NOT A LITTLE PLEASED AND SOFTENED THAT GOOD NATURED GENTLEMAN
FLING SOME WATER IN HIS FACE MISS SHARP OR CARRY HIM UPSTAIRS THE DEAR CREATURE'S FAINTING POOR VICTIM CARRY HIM UP HE'S AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER
I SHALL TAKE CARE HOW I LET YOU CHOOSE FOR ME ANOTHER TIME SAID REBECCA AS THEY WENT DOWN AGAIN TO DINNER
AND AS IT WAS RATHER DARK MISS AMELIA IN THE MOST UNAFFECTED WAY IN THE WORLD PUT HER HAND INTO MISTER OSBORNE'S WHO OF COURSE COULD SEE THE WAY AMONG THE CHAIRS AND OTTOMANS A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN SHE COULD
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WROTE TO HIM TO COME ON TWELFTH NIGHT EMMY AND SPELT TWELFTH WITHOUT THE F THAT WAS YEARS AGO SAID AMELIA IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY DON'T IT JOHN SAID MISSUS SEDLEY TO HER HUSBAND
IF A PERSON IS TOO POOR TO KEEP A SERVANT THOUGH EVER SO ELEGANT HE MUST SWEEP HIS OWN ROOMS IF A DEAR GIRL HAS NO DEAR MAMMA TO SETTLE MATTERS WITH THE YOUNG MAN SHE MUST DO IT FOR HERSELF AND OH WHAT A MERCY IT IS THAT THESE WOMEN DO NOT
SAID THE COLLECTOR IT MADE ME CRY ALMOST PON MY HONOUR IT DID BECAUSE YOU HAVE A KIND HEART MISTER JOSEPH ALL THE SEDLEYS HAVE I THINK IT KEPT ME AWAKE LAST NIGHT AND I WAS TRYING TO HUM IT THIS MORNING IN BED
QUITE READY TO KISS HER BROTHER IF HE WERE SO MINDED AND I THINK FOR A KISS FROM SUCH A DEAR CREATURE AS AMELIA I WOULD PURCHASE ALL MISTER LEE'S CONSERVATORIES OUT OF HAND O HEAVENLY HEAVENLY FLOWERS EXCLAIMED MISS SHARP
BUT THE YOUNG WOMEN WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE GIFT AS JOSEPH PRESENTED ONE TO EACH WITH AN EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN BOW BRAVO JOS CRIED OSBORNE THANK YOU DEAR JOSEPH SAID AMELIA
A PROMISE THAT HE JOSEPH WOULD TAKE HER TO VAUXHALL NOW SHE SAID THAT REBECCA IS WITH US WILL BE THE VERY TIME O DELIGHTFUL SAID REBECCA GOING TO CLAP HER HANDS BUT SHE RECOLLECTED HERSELF AND PAUSED LIKE A MODEST CREATURE AS SHE WAS
BUT VOWED THAT HE HAD TOTALLY FORGOTTEN IT WELL DO YOU REMEMBER COMING DOWN IN A GIG TO DOCTOR SWISHTAIL'S TO SEE ME BEFORE YOU WENT TO INDIA AND GIVING ME HALF A GUINEA AND A PAT ON THE HEAD I ALWAYS HAD AN IDEA THAT YOU WERE AT LEAST SEVEN FEET HIGH
AND THE TWO ACCORDINGLY FOLLOWED MISTER JOSEPH REBECCA SANG FAR BETTER THAN HER FRIEND THOUGH OF COURSE OSBORNE WAS FREE TO KEEP HIS OPINION AND EXERTED HERSELF TO THE UTMOST AND INDEED TO THE WONDER OF AMELIA
HE DESCRIBED THE BALLS AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY KEPT THEMSELVES COOL IN THE HOT WEATHER WITH PUNKAHS TATTIES AND OTHER CONTRIVANCES
AND IN THESE MEDITATIONS HE FELL ASLEEP HOW MISS SHARP LAY AWAKE THINKING WILL HE COME OR NOT TO MORROW NEED NOT BE TOLD HERE
WHO HAD NEVER KNOWN HER PERFORM SO WELL SHE SANG A FRENCH SONG WHICH JOSEPH DID NOT UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST AND WHICH GEORGE CONFESSED HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND THEN A NUMBER OF THOSE SIMPLE BALLADS WHICH WERE THE FASHION FORTY YEARS AGO
HERE IS EMMY'S LITTLE FRIEND MAKING LOVE TO HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN THAT'S QUITE CLEAR AND IF SHE DOES NOT CATCH HIM SOME OTHER WILL THAT MAN IS DESTINED TO BE A PREY TO WOMAN AS I AM TO GO ON CHANGE EVERY DAY
AT SIX WEEKS OLD HE HAD RECEIVED FROM JOHN SEDLEY A PRESENT OF A SILVER CUP AT SIX MONTHS OLD A CORAL WITH GOLD WHISTLE AND BELLS FROM HIS YOUTH UPWARDS HE WAS TIPPED REGULARLY BY THE OLD GENTLEMAN AT CHRISTMAS
IT WAS AN ADVANCE AND AS SUCH PERHAPS SOME LADIES OF INDISPUTABLE CORRECTNESS AND GENTILITY WILL CONDEMN THE ACTION AS IMMODEST BUT YOU SEE POOR DEAR REBECCA HAD ALL THIS WORK TO DO FOR HERSELF
SHE WAS ALL RESPECTFUL GRATITUDE TO MISSUS SEDLEY DELIGHTED BEYOND MEASURE AT THE BAZAARS AND IN A WHIRL OF WONDER AT THE THEATRE WHITHER THE GOOD NATURED LADY TOOK HER ONE DAY AMELIA HAD A HEADACHE AND COULD NOT GO UPON SOME PARTY OF PLEASURE TO WHICH THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WERE INVITED
JOS IS A GREAT DEAL VAINER THAN YOU EVER WERE IN YOUR LIFE AND THAT'S SAYING A GOOD DEAL THOUGH SOME THIRTY YEARS AGO IN THE YEAR SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WHAT WAS IT PERHAPS YOU HAD A RIGHT TO BE VAIN I DON'T SAY NO
HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HER IN AN IMPLORING ATTITUDE AND HIS HANDS BOUND IN A WEB OF GREEN SILK WHICH SHE WAS UNWINDING IN THIS ROMANTIC POSITION OSBORNE AND AMELIA FOUND THE INTERESTING PAIR
SO THE CONVERSATION WENT ON I DON'T KNOW ON WHAT PRETEXT OSBORNE LEFT THE ROOM OR WHY PRESENTLY AMELIA WENT AWAY PERHAPS TO SUPERINTEND THE SLICING OF THE PINE APPLE
NO SAID SHE I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T AND THEN SHE GAVE HIM EVER SO GENTLE A PRESSURE WITH HER LITTLE HAND AND DREW IT BACK QUITE FRIGHTENED AND LOOKED FIRST FOR ONE INSTANT IN HIS FACE AND THEN DOWN AT THE CARPET RODS
AND AS OBLIGED THE YOUNG PEOPLE PERFORCE TO REMAIN AT HOME MISTER OSBORNE DID NOT SEEM IN THE LEAST DISAPPOINTED AT THIS OCCURRENCE HE AND JOSEPH SEDLEY DRANK A FITTING QUANTITY OF PORT WINE TETE A TETE IN THE DINING ROOM
AND HE WAS VERY WITTY REGARDING THE NUMBER OF SCOTCHMEN WHOM LORD MINTO THE GOVERNOR GENERAL PATRONISED AND THEN HE DESCRIBED A TIGER HUNT AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MAHOUT OF HIS ELEPHANT HAD BEEN PULLED OFF HIS SEAT BY ONE OF THE INFURIATED ANIMALS
SO HAVING A TRAP SET IN OUR HOUSE TO CATCH MICE AND BEING ALWAYS MORE OR LESS SUCCESSFUL IN CATCHING THE VERMIN I ONE DAY TOOK THE TRAP WITH A MOUSE IN IT TO THE GARDEN AND BY DINT
AVAILED THEMSELVES OF HIS ACCOMMODATIONS AND THUS SUCCEEDED IN REACHING CANADA HIS RISK WAS VERY GREAT ON THIS ACCOUNT HE CLAIMED AS DID CERTAIN OTHERS THAT IT WAS NO MORE THAN FAIR TO CHARGE FOR HIS SERVICES
TO ANY ONE WHO MAY HAVE FED IT WHEN HUNGRY NOT LONG AGO WRITES A LADY TO ME A CAT ONE OF THE KIND KEPT AS A MACHINE USED TO FREQUENT OUR GARDEN STARVED ENOUGH POOR THING AS ITS KNOTTY FUR BETOKENED
I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING YOU WITH THESE FEW LINES TO INFORM YOU THAT I ARRIVED HERE TO DAY AND HOPE THAT THIS MAY FIND YOURSELF AND MISSUS STILL WELL AS THIS LEAVES ME AT THE PRESENT I WILL ALSO SAY TO YOU
HE HOPPED OFF TO THE WOODS AGAIN HE DID NOT RETURN HOWEVER AND FOR TWO YEARS WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN BUT ONE DARK NIGHT HIS MASTER ON PASSING THROUGH A WOOD HAD HIS ATTENTION ATTRACTED BY THE CRIES OF A CAT
THIS WAS THE TURNING POINT OF HIS ILLNESS HE BEGAN TO RALLY AND SOON GOT WELL AND PLUMP AND SLEEK AND THE OTHER DAY DIED AT THE AGE OF TWELVE BUT IT WAS A TREAT TO SEE HOW
IN NORTH CAROLINA MONEY AND ALSO HIS DARK ORANGE COLORED INTELLIGENT AND GOOD LOOKING TURNKEY BOB SERVED HIM RIGHT IT IS NO STEALING FOR ONE PIECE OF PROPERTY TO GO OFF WITH ANOTHER PIECE REASONED A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE
AND HIS LITTLE NURSE WAS FINALLY REWARDED BY HAVING HER PET GAMBOLLING AROUND HER AS USUAL A CAT SOME TIME AGO RECEIVED A CHARGE OF RAGGED SHOT IN HIS SHOULDER
SO PITIFUL AN OBJECT LOOKED HE THAT HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS HAD THE SIN OF KEEPING HIM ALIVE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT TO THEM BY THEIR FRIENDS INDEED HE WAS NOW SO WEAK AS TO BE UNABLE TO MOVE
AS WELL AS WRITING TO A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE JOE AND BOB HAD THE ASSURANCE TO WRITE BACK TO THE TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE KEEPER IN THEIR LETTER THEY STATED THAT THEY HAD ARRIVED SAFELY IN CANADA AND WERE HAVING GOOD TIMES
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD HAD BUT FEW PRIVILEGES SUNDAYS AND WEEK DAYS ALIKE HE WAS KEPT PRETTY SEVERELY BENT DOWN TO DUTY HE HAD BEEN BEATEN AND KNOCKED AROUND SHAMEFULLY HE HAD A WIFE
SO AFTER HAVING ATTENDED TO ALL HIS DISAGREEABLE DUTIES HE MADE HIS GRAB AND GOT A HAND FULL HE DID NOT KNOW HOWEVER HOW IT WOULD HOLD OUT THAT EVENING INSTEAD OF PARTICIPATING WITH THE GAY DANCERS
AND DOUBTLESS WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF BEHAVING HIMSELF HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE AUCTION BLOCK HAVING BEEN SOLD THREE TIMES AND HAD HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF A CRUEL MASTER EACH TIME
CATS ALWAYS SHOW GRATITUDE BY LICKING YOUR HAND IT IS THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT A CAT CAN PAY YOU FOR THEY ARE NOT SO READY AS DOGS TO SOW THEIR KISSES AND CARESSES BROAD CAST I WAS AMUSED THE OTHER DAY
AND A MOST HEARTLESS WRETCH HE WAS IN JOE'S ESTIMATION THE TRUTH WAS JOE COULD NOT STAND THE BURDENS AND ABUSES WHICH SADLER WAS INCLINED TO HEAP UPON HIM SO HE CONCLUDED TO JOIN HIS BROTHER
FURTHER THAN TO SUGGEST THAT WHATEVER UNDERSTANDING WAS AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES THEMSELVES SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY ADHERED TO MANY SLAVES IN CITIES COULD RAISE BY HOOK OR BY CROOK FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY FOR A PASSAGE
THAT WAS FOR A WHOLE FORTNIGHT IN A TRAP THE CRUEL KEEPERS HAD LEFT HIM FOR ALL THAT TIME WITHOUT EITHER FOOD OR DRINK HE WAS AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED BY HIS OWNER
BUT IN LONG LINGERING ILLNESSES PUSSY IS A MUCH BETTER PATIENT PUSSY MOREOVER IS BLESSED WITH EXTREME GOOD NATURE AND WILL PARDON ALMOST ANY INJURY FROM ONE SHE LOVES
AND DOESN'T CARE A RAT'S TAIL HOW SHE LOOKS WHEN A CAT'S COAT BEGINS TO APPEAR ROUGH AND STARE IT IS THE FIRST INDICATION OF APPROACHING ILLNESS AND THIS SYMPTOM
AND PUT THE QUESTION TO THEM DIRECT ARE YOU THE ONES WE ARE THEY OWNED UP WITHOUT HESITATION THE COMMITTEE DID NOT SEE A DOLLAR OF THEIR MONEY BUT UNDERSTOOD THEY HAD ABOUT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS AFTER PAYING THE CAPTAIN WHILE BOB CONSIDERED
HIS ACCOUNT OF THINGS WAS TOO HARROWING FOR DETAIL HERE EXCEPT IN THE BRIEFEST MANNER AND THAT ONLY WITH REFERENCE TO A FEW PARTICULARS IN ORDER TO PREPARE SLAVES FOR THE MARKET
ON THE NINTH DAY HE COULD JUST SING ONE BAR AND ON THE TENTH DAY ONLY ONE NOTE THIS CAT HAD A GREAT DISLIKE FOR MONTHS AFTERWARDS TO MILK IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM
IF YOU HAD I DARE BE SWORN TUCKER WOULD HAVE ALIGHTED ON HIS FEET AT THE OTHER SIDE
AND WATCH FOR THE RETURN OF HER MASTER OR MISTRESS BE THEY NEVER SO LONG ABSENT SHE KNOWS THEIR FOOTSTEPS AND JUMPS UP AT THEIR KNOCK AND RUNS TO THE DOOR TO MEET THEM I KNOW OF A POOR CAT
VERY WELL SAID ROBERT TO DAY I WILL PLEASE MY MASTER SO WELL THAT I WILL CATCH HIM AT AN UNGUARDED MOMENT
OLD NAME MARY EPPS NOW JOSEPH AND ROBERT MARY'S ASSOCIATE PASSENGERS FROM RICHMOND MUST HERE BE NOTICED JOSEPH WAS OF A DARK ORANGE COLOR MEDIUM SIZE VERY ACTIVE AND INTELLIGENT
DARK COMPLEXION ROUND BUILT AND INTELLIGENT SHE HAD BEEN THE MOTHER OF FIFTEEN CHILDREN FOUR OF WHOM HAD BEEN SOLD AWAY FROM HER ONE WAS STILL HELD IN SLAVERY IN PETERSBURG THE OTHERS WERE ALL DEAD
YOUR LETTER OF DATE APRIL SEVENTH I HAVE JUST GOT IT HAD BEEN OPENED BEFORE IT CAME TO ME I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY OTHER LETTER FROM YOU AND CAN GET NO ACCOUNT OF THEM IN THE POST OFFICE IN THIS PLACE
SHE HAD FORMERLY BELONGED TO THE LATE LITTLETON REEVES WHOM SHE REPRESENTED AS HAVING BEEN KIND TO HER MUCH MORE SO THAN HER MISTRESS MISSUS REEVES SAID MARY SHE BEING OF A JEALOUS DISPOSITION
WHEN A FOE MAY POUNCE UPON HER SHE HAS TO SLEEP EVEN WITH OPEN EARS IS IT ANY WONDER THEN THAT WHEN ROUSED FROM SLUMBER BY A CRUEL AND PAINFUL TREAD ON HER TAIL SHE SHOULD START UP
THE HUSBAND OF MARY HAD FOR A LONG TIME WANTED HIS OWN FREEDOM BUT DID NOT FEEL THAT HE COULD GO WITHOUT HIS WIFE IN FACT HE RESOLVED TO GET HER OFF FIRST THEN TO TRY AND ESCAPE HIMSELF IF POSSIBLE
AND SEEMED IN NO WAY INCONVENIENCED FROM THE LOSS OF ITS HIND LEG BUT TRAVELLERS NEVER CAN SETTLE AND PUSS TOOK TO THE WOODS AGAIN
ROBERT HIS YOUNGER BROTHER
WERE SAFELY LANDED AT THE USUAL PLACE AND SO ACCURATE WERE THE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE PAPER THAT ON FIRST SEEING THEM THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZED THEM INSTANTLY AND WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS CEREMONIES
AND EVERY TIME THE POULTICE WAS CHANGED THE CAT LICKED HER HAND IN EVIDENT GRATITUDE IN FACT TOM MADE THE BEST OF PATIENTS BEING MORE LIKE A SINCERE CHRISTIAN THAN ANYTHING ELSE
AND TAKEN HOME ALTHOUGH A BEAUTIFUL LARGE TOM TABBY WHEN HE LEFT HOME HE WAS REDUCED TO A PERFECT SKELETON HIS LEG HAD TO BE AMPUTATED BUT HE BORE THE OPERATION WITHOUT FLINCHING
WHILE THE BRUTAL TRADER WOULD STRAP THEM WITH A BROAD LEATHER STRAP THE STRAP BEING PREFERRED TO THE COW HIDE AS IT WOULD NOT BREAK THE SKIN AND DAMAGE THE SALE ONE HUNDRED LASHES WOULD ONLY BE A COMMON FLOGGING
ONLY ONE OBSTACLE STOOD IN HIS WAY MATERIAL AID IT OCCURRED TO ROBERT THAT HE HAD FREQUENT ACCESS TO THE MONEY DRAWER AND OFTEN IT CONTAINED THE PROCEEDS OF FRESH SALES OF FLESH AND BLOOD
THUS WHILE THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE OF PHILADELPHIA ESPECIALLY NEITHER CHARGED NOR ACCEPTED ANYTHING FOR THEIR SERVICES IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT ANY OF THE SOUTHERN AGENTS COULD AFFORD TO DO LIKEWISE
AND THE TRADER TOLD THE CAPTAIN THAT HE WOULD GIVE HIM TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF HE WOULD GET THEM FINALLY HE TOLD HIM HE WOULD GIVE EVERY CENT THEY WOULD BRING WHICH WOULD BE MUCH OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AS THEY WERE SO VERY LIKELY
REMINDING YOU ONLY THEN BY HER LOUD SINGING AND DEMONSTRATIVE KINDNESS THAT THERE IS STILL A LITTLE HOLE IN HER STOMACH THAT WANTS FILLING AND HOW PATIENTLY SIT AND WAIT
AND HE REASONED THAT IF SOME OF THAT WOULD HELP HIM AND HIS BROTHER TO FREEDOM THERE COULD BE NO HARM IN HELPING HIMSELF THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THE CAPTAIN WAS ALL READY AND PROVIDED HE COULD GET THREE PASSENGERS AT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ROUGH TREATMENT AT BABY HANDS TUCKER WAS ABOUT THE BEST NATURED LUMP OF A CAT I EVER KNEW YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE ANYTHING WITH HIM FLUNG HIM OVER THE CHURCH FOR INSTANCE
AND TOM HIMSELF LOOKED GENERALLY SEEDY AND OUT OF SORTS NOW HAD IT BEEN A BOY INSTEAD OF A GIRL HE WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE DONE NOTHING USEFUL BUT FEMALES ARE ALWAYS PRACTICAL
THE ANIMAL WAS IN A TREE AND ON THE GENTLEMAN'S APPROACH IT SPRANG DOWN AND COMMENCED RUBBING ROUND HIS LEGS WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS ON BENDING DOWN TO CARESS IT
WITH A LARGE POULTICE THEN SHE ROLLED HIM IN AN OLD SHAWL AND PUT HIM TO BED IN A BASKET TOM KEPT HIS BED FOR TEN DAYS DURING WHICH TIME SHE FED HIM FROM A PLATE NOT ALLOWING HIM TO GET UP
SAID TUCKER POPPING OUT HIS HEAD AT A CORNER AS MUCH AS TO SAY NOT JUST YET FRIEND AND THE LAUGH WAS ALL AGAINST THE GROCER HOW PATIENTLY A CAT WILL WAIT FOR HER DINNER UNTIL EVERY ONE ELSE IS SERVED
BE KIND ENOUGH TO SEND A FEW LINES TO THE LADY SPOKEN OF FOR THAT MOCKING BIRD AND MUCH OBLIGE ME WRITE ME SOON AND BELIEVE ME YOUR OBEDIENT SERV'T LOVE AND RESPECTS TO LADY AND DAUGHTER JOSEPH ROBINSON
HOW PATIENTLY A DOG WILL BEAR A LIKE ACCIDENT AY BUT SAY I YOU MUST BEAR IN MIND THREE THINGS FIRST A DOG IS GENERALLY LARGER THAN A CAT AND A TREAD IS CONSEQUENTLY A MERE TRIFLE TO HIM
A BEAUTIFUL GROUSE OR PLUMP LITTLE PARTRIDGE WITNESS THEIR PATIENCE AND LONG SUFFERING WITH CHILDREN THIS I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN ABOUT AND NEED NOT REPEAT HAVING PROVED
FROM HIS BED BY THE KITCHEN FIRE ON THE TENTH DAY WHEN HE WAS AT HIS VERY WORST A LITTLE RAW MEAT WAS GIVEN HIM AND HIS HEAD BEING SUPPORTED HE MANAGED TO SWALLOW IT
THE FIRST ESSENTIAL STEP TOWARDS SUCCESS HE CONSIDERED WAS TO SAVE HIS MONEY AND MAKE IT AN OBJECT TO THE CAPTAIN TO HELP HIM SO WHEN HE HAD MANAGED TO LAY BY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE WILLINGLY OFFERED THIS SUM TO CAPTAIN B
TILL THE VERY LAST A GOOD SOLID HARE HE SAID FEELING THE BUNDLE BUT BLESS ME ISN'T HE WARM DO YOU THINK HE IS REALLY DEAD
AND SHE IS ALWAYS REWARDED WITH SUCCESS SHE IS THE SAME IN THE HUNTING FIELD WAITING FOR HOURS AT THE DOOR OF A RABBIT BURROW TILL POOR BUNNY OR SOME ONE OF HER CHILDREN PEEPS OUT
I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHETHER A CAT IS PROPERLY CARED FOR AND HAS SUFFICIENT FOOD BY THE APPEARANCE OF HER COAT IF SHE IS ALLOWED TO BE HUNGRY OR IS BADLY HOUSED SHE SOON LOSES ALL TASTE IN HERSELF
WHETHER INFLICTED BY TRAPS OR STONES YOU MEAN TO DO THEM GOOD CATS EVEN STRANGE CATS OFTEN LICK MY HANDS WHEN I AM PROBING A WOUND AND INFLICTING THE MOST SEVERE PAIN ON THEM
I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT CATS ARE UNFORGIVING OR THAT A FRIENDSHIP OF YEARS MAY BE CANCELLED IN A MOMENT BY AN ACCIDENTAL TREAD ON ITS TAIL OR FEET LOOK THE SAME PARTIES WILL TELL YOU
AND THE HOPE THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD SOON FOLLOW HER TO CANADA INSPIRED HER WITH EXPECTATIONS THAT SHE WOULD ONE DAY SIT UNDER HER OWN VINE AND FIG TREE WHERE NONE DARED TO MOLEST OR MAKE HER AFRAID
STRUGGLING A LITTLE AT FIRST ONLY BUT GIVING VENT TO NO EXPRESSION OF PAIN HE MADE A VERY GOOD RECOVERY BUT BEING ONE OF THE MIGHTY HUNTER PERSUASION AS SOON AS HE WAS PERFECTLY RECOVERED
A REGULAR NEGRO TRADER EIGHT YEARS THIS SLAVE'S DUTIES HAD BEEN AT THE SLAVE PRISON AND AMONG OTHER DAILY OFFICES HE HAD TO ATTEND TO WAS TO LOCK UP THE PRISON
HE LEFT AS HE DID HIS WIFE IN SLAVERY HE DECLARED THAT HE STUCK TO THEM AS LONG AS HE COULD GEORGE E SADLER THE KEEPER OF AN OYSTER HOUSE HELD THE DEED FOR JOE
MY BROTHER IS ALSO AT WORK WITH ME AND DOING WELL THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT WOULD INTEREST YOU IN THE WAY OF NEWS THERE IS A MASONIC LODGE OF OUR PEOPLE AND TWO CHURCHES AND SOCIETYS HERE AND SOME OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR OUR BENEFIT
THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES WAS THOUGHT NOTHING OF OFTEN I HAVE BEEN FLOGGED FOR REFUSING TO FLOG OTHERS WHILE NOT YET TWENTY THREE YEARS OF AGE ROBERT EXPRESSED HIMSELF
AND THIS EMBRYO MISS NIGHTINGALE AFTER HAVING A GOOD CRY SET ABOUT AT ONCE TO PUT MATTERS STRAIGHT FOR POOR TOM
IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE THEM GREASED AND RUBBED TO MAKE THEM LOOK BRIGHT AND SHINING AND HE WENT ON FURTHER TO STATE THAT FEMALES AS WELL AS MALES WERE NOT UNCOMMONLY STRIPPED NAKED LASHED FLAT TO A BENCH AND THEN HELD BY TWO MEN SOMETIMES FOUR
MARY FLED FROM PETERSBURG AND THE ROBINSONS FROM RICHMOND
AT SEEING THE CARE AND ATTENTION A LITTLE GIRL WAS BESTOWING ON A PET CAT TOM HAD BEEN OUT ALL NIGHT AND CAME IN NEXT DAY ON THREE LEGS THE ONE HE CARRIED WAS WOUNDED BRUISED AND MUCH SWOLLEN
CAUSED ME TO BE HIRED OUT WITH A HARD FAMILY WHERE I WAS MUCH ABUSED FREQUENTLY FLOGGED AND STINTED FOR FOOD ET CETERA BUT THE SWEETS OF FREEDOM IN THE CARE OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE NOW DELIGHTED HER MIND
HOW FAR THE CAPTAIN TALKED APPROVINGLY HE DID NOT EXACTLY TELL THE COMMITTEE BUT THEY GUESSED HE TALKED STRONG DEMOCRATIC DOCTRINE TO THEM UNDER THE FRIGHTFUL CIRCUMSTANCES
AND WILL ASK HIM FOR A PASS TO GO TO A BALL TO NIGHT SLAVE HOLDERS LOVE TO SEE THEIR SLAVES FIDDLING AND DANCING OF NIGHTS AND AS I SHALL BE LEAVING IN A HURRY I WILL TAKE A GRAB FROM THE DAY'S SALE AND WHEN SLATER HEARS OF ME AGAIN I WILL BE IN CANADA
HE WOULD SET SAIL WITHOUT MUCH OTHER FREIGHT OF COURSE HE WAS TOO SHREWD TO GET OUT PAPERS FOR PHILADELPHIA THAT WOULD BETRAY HIM AT ONCE WASHINGTON OR BALTIMORE
THE COMMITTEE RENDERED HER THE USUAL ASSISTANCE AND IN DUE TIME FORWARDED HER ON TO QUEEN VICTORIA'S FREE LAND IN CANADA ON HER ARRIVAL SHE WROTE BACK AS FOLLOWS TORONTO MARCH FOURTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
SHE RESEMBLES THE FEMALE OF THE HUMAN FAMILY PUSSY IS FOR EVER CLEANING AND WASHING AT HERSELF IF A WELL BRED PARLOUR CAT SHE WILL NEVER ALLOW A SPECK OF DIRT TO SULLY HER FUR
UNTIL THEY MIGHT REACH THE DEPOT AT PHILADELPHIA THE RICHMOND DISPATCH AN ENTERPRISING PAPER IN THE INTEREST OF SLAVEHOLDERS WHICH CAME DAILY TO THE COMMITTEE WAS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF THE PASSENGERS
WHICH SHE EVINCES UNDER SUFFERINGS SOMETIMES THE MOST ACUTE WE TALK ABOUT DOGS BEING GAME AND TAKING THEIR DEATH EASY AND SO THEY MOSTLY DO UNDER EXCITEMENT
OF VERY LITTLE PERSUASION MANAGED TO GET NEAR THIS CAT WAIF AND GIVE IT THE MOUSE THAT WAS QUITE ENOUGH IT GOT THEM EVER AFTER SO LONG AS IT WAS IN LIFE
AND WOULD BRING ANY KIND OF FREIGHT THAT WOULD PAY THE MOST WAS THE CONDUCTOR IN THIS INSTANCE
THAT OF ALL OUR DOMESTIC PETS PUSSY UNDOUBTEDLY BEARS THE BELL FOR PERSONAL CLEANLINESS NATURE HAS ADORNED HER WITH A MOST BEAUTIFUL COAT OF THE SOFTEST SILKIEST FUR AND LOVELIEST OF COLOURS
PATIENTLY POOR TACKET BORE HIS ILLNESS EVERY MORNING WHEN HIS MASTER WENT TO SEE HIM ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT RISE HE TRIED TO SING BUT THE POWER OF PURRING LEFT HIM AS HE GOT WEAKER
THAT PUSSY'S PATIENCE IS BEST EXEMPLIFIED A POOR CAT MANY YEARS AGO TOOK A SEVERE ILLNESS JAUNDICE HE WAS A FINE LARGE TOM CAT OF THE NAME OF TACKET
SHE WILL CREEP FROM UNDER THE SOFA OR BED TO FONDLY CARESS THE VERY ONE WHO HURT HER NO ANIMAL APPRECIATES KINDNESS MORE THAN A CAT WITNESS THE GRATITUDE EVEN A POOR STRAY WILL EVINCE
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE DISPATCH BROUGHT THE NEWS
AND INVARIABLY FROM THAT DATE WHENEVER IT SAW ME IN THE GARDEN IT WOULD COME BOUNDING TO ME AND I AM SURE BY ITS DUMB DELIGHT IT WELL REPAID ME SHOWING THAT IT FULLY APPRECIATED BOTH THE VOICE
THAT MAKES OUR DOMESTIC CAT SUCH AN EXCELLENT HUNTER AND VERMIN KILLER WE ALL KNOW HOW PATIENTLY SHE WILL SIT IN A CORNER AND WATCH FOR A MOUSE OR RAT SHE KNOWS VERY WELL IT WILL COME SOONER OR LATER
PUSSY'S PATIENCE AND CLEANLINESS NEXT TO A CAT'S LOVE FOR CHILDREN IF THERE IS ONE THING MORE THAN ANOTHER THAT OUGHT TO MAKE ONE LOVE HER AND RESPECT HER AS A PET IT IS THE EXTREME PATIENCE
AS HAVING BECOME SO DAILY SICK OF THE BRUTALITY AND SUFFERING HE COULD NOT HELP WITNESSING THAT HE FELT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY STAND IT ANY LONGER LET THE COST BE WHAT IT MIGHT IN THIS STATE OF MIND HE MET WITH CAPTAIN B
OR SCOTCH CHEESE HE WAS ONCE SENT A DISTANCE OF THIRTY YARDS TRUSSED UP IN THIS FASHION TO A SHOPKEEPER'S PLACE TO BE WEIGHED TUCKER WENT THROUGH THE OPERATION SO PATIENTLY THAT THE GROCER NEVER SUSPECTED
HE FAINTED FROM LOSS OF BLOOD AND AFTERWARDS HAD HIGH FEVER JUST AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD HAVE DONE UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES THE GREATER PORTION OF THE SHOT WAS EXTRACTED OR WORKED OUT IN THE PROCESS OF HEALING
IN THE EATING LINE HAD AN ABUNDANCE OF THE BEST ALSO HAD VERY CHOICE WINES AND BRANDIES WHICH THEY SUPPOSED THAT THEY TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE KEEPER WOULD GIVE A GREAT DEAL TO HAVE A SMACK AT AND THEN THEY GAVE THEM A VERY CORDIAL INVITATION TO MAKE THEM A VISIT
THAT I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING ALONG THE TWO YOUNG MEN THAT WAS WITH ME LEFT ME AT SUSPENSION BRIDGE THEY WENT ANOTHER WAY I CANNOT SAY MUCH ABOUT THE PLACE AS I HAVE BEN HERE BUT A SHORT TIME BUT SO FAR AS I HAVE SEEN I LIKE VERY WELL
THE GENTLEMAN WAS SURPRISED TO FIND IT HAD ONLY THREE LEGS IT FOLLOWED HIM HOME AND HE THEN MADE CERTAIN IT WAS NONE OTHER THAN HIS LONG LOST PET IT STOPPED AT HOME FOR MANY A DAY AFTER THIS
INDEED HE DID NOT PROFESS TO BRING PERSONS FOR NOTHING EXCEPT IN RARE INSTANCES
WHEN LO AND BEHOLD IN TURNING TO THE INTERESTING COLUMN CONTAINING THE ELEGANT ILLUSTRATIONS OF RUNAWAY NEGROES IT WAS SEEN THAT THE UNFORTUNATE SLATER
ROBERT WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN AND FROM LONG AND DAILY EXPERIENCE WITH THE CUSTOMS AND USAGES OF THE SLAVE PRISON HE WAS AS FAMILIAR WITH THE BUSINESS AS A PENNSYLVANIA FARMER WITH HIS BARN YARD STOCK
ONE PORTION HOWEVER PUSSY CARRIED TO HIS GRAVE WITH HIM DURING THE PAINFUL PROCESS OF HAVING HIS WOUNDS PROBED FOR SHOT
IS APPENDED A SHORT LETTER ANNOUNCING THEIR ARRIVAL AND CONDITION UNDER THE BRITISH LION SAINT CATHARINE APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
I AM WELL AND HAVE GOT A GOOD SITUATION IN THIS CITY AND INTEND STAYING HERE
WAS IN LIKE MANNER CAUGHT IN A TRAP AND HAD TO ENDURE AMPUTATION OF THE LEG ALTHOUGH IN MUCH SUFFERING AND PAIN
AND A VERY GREAT PET BUT IN A SHORT TIME HE GOT REDUCED TO A MERE BAG OF BONES
THE CAPTAIN WHO BROUGHT AWAY THE THREE PASSENGERS MADE IT HIS BUSINESS FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER TO CALL AT THE OYSTER HOUSE KEPT BY THE OWNER OF JOE AND WHILE THERE THIS LETTER WAS READ AND COMMENTED ON IN TORRENTS OF BILLINGSGATE PHRASES
YOU WILL GIVE MY RESPECT TO YOUR LADY AND MISTER AND MISSUS BROWN IF YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN TO PETERSBURG YOU WILL PLEASE TO WRITE AS SOON AS CAN I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO WRITE AT PRESENT BUT YOURS RESPECTFULLY EMMA BROWN
BUT THIS LITTLE EPISODE WAS NOT A MATTER TO EXCITE SYMPATHY IN THE BREASTS OF THE HIGHLY REFINED AND TENDER HEARTED CHRISTIAN MOTHERS OF PETERSBURG IN THE MERCY OF PROVIDENCE HOWEVER HER REASON AND STRENGTH RETURNED
AND SHE SPARES NO PAINS TO KEEP IT CLEAN AND SMART I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE CAT IS VERY PROUD OF HER APPEARANCE AND LIKES TO CUT A DASH HERE AGAIN BY THE BYE
THE CAPTAIN AGREED TO THE TERMS AND FULFILLED HIS ENGAGEMENT TO THE LETTER ABOUT THE FIRST OF MARCH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE MARY WAS PRESENTED TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE SHE WAS OF AGREEABLE MANNERS ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE
AND WITHOUT FIRST GREASING THEMSELVES AND THEN HANGING ON VERY FAST THE JOURNEY MIGHT NOT PROVE ALTOGETHER ADVANTAGEOUS TO THEM THIS WAS WORMWOOD AND GALL TO THE TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE MAN A MOST REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE WAS THAT
SECONDLY A CAT IS TEN TIMES MORE SENSITIVE TO PAIN THAN A DOG AND THIRDLY A CAT HAS SO MANY ENEMIES OF ALL SORTS THAT SHE MUST BE FOR EVER ON THE ALERT TO AVERT DANGER NOT KNOWING
AND SHOW FIGHT OR RUN OFF GROWLING PERHAPS INDEED ONLY HALF AWAKE BUT MALICE SHE NEVER HARBOURS IN HER HEART AND IN HALF AN HOUR WHEN SHE HAS THOUGHT THE MATTER OVER
WERE NAMES WHICH STOOD FAIR IN THE EYES OF VIRGINIA CONSEQUENTLY BEING ABLE TO PACK THE FUGITIVES AWAY IN A VERY PRIVATE HOLE OF HIS BOAT AND BEING ONLY BOUND FOR A SOUTHERN PORT THE CAPTAIN WAS WILLING TO RISK HIS SHARE OF THE DANGER
THEN I'LL HAVE YOU SAYS PUSS AND FORTHWITH WALKS IT OFF OR HIDDEN UNDER A HEATHER HILLOCK OR A TURNIP LEAF SHE WILL WAIT AND WAIT AND NEVER WEARY UNTIL SHE CAN SECURE
AT THE SALE OF ONE OF HER CHILDREN SHE WAS SO AFFECTED WITH GRIEF THAT SHE WAS THROWN INTO VIOLENT CONVULSIONS
WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AFTER PAYING THE WORTHY CAPTAIN ONE HUNDRED EACH FOR HIMSELF AND HIS BROTHER BESIDES MAKING THE CAPTAIN AN ADDITIONAL PRESENT OF NEARLY ONE HUNDRED WIND AND TIDE WERE NOW
HE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE SOFA AND STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT HIS OVERCOAT LYING THERE AS THOUGH HE WERE AFRAID TO TOUCH IT WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED MISSUS VERLOC IN A SUBDUED VOICE
BECAUSE MISTER VERLOC WENT OUT VERY EARLY THAT MORNING AND DID NOT COME BACK TILL NEARLY DUSK SHE DID NOT MIND BEING ALONE SHE HAD NO DESIRE TO GO OUT
MISSUS VERLOC ROSE AND WALKING TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE SAID IN THE FULNESS OF HER HEART AND YOU ARE NOT TIRED OF ME MISTER VERLOC MADE NO SOUND
HIS EXPRESSION WAS PROUD APPREHENSIVE AND CONCENTRATED LIKE THAT OF A SMALL CHILD ENTRUSTED FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH A BOX OF MATCHES
YOU'LL WANT SOME BREAKFAST SHE SAID FROM A DISTANCE MISTER VERLOC MOVED HIS HANDS SLIGHTLY AS IF OVERCOME BY AN IMPOSSIBLE SUGGESTION BUT ONCE ENTICED INTO THE PARLOUR HE DID NOT REJECT THE FOOD SET BEFORE HIM
BUT MISTER VERLOC WAS NOT A DEBAUCHED MAN IN HIS CONDUCT HE WAS RESPECTABLE HIS APPEARANCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE EFFECT OF A FEVERISH COLD HE DRANK THREE CUPS OF TEA BUT ABSTAINED FROM FOOD ENTIRELY HE RECOILED FROM IT
MICHAELIS WOULDN'T MIND GIVING STEVIE A ROOM TO SLEEP IN THERE WERE NO VISITORS AND NO TALK THERE MICHAELIS WAS WRITING A BOOK MISSUS VERLOC DECLARED HER AFFECTION FOR MICHAELIS MENTIONED HER ABHORRENCE OF KARL YUNDT
NOTHING MUCH IT SEEMED MOSTLY NONSENSE ENOUGH TO LET ME GUESS THAT SOMETHING WORRIED YOU MISTER VERLOC RAMMED HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD A CRIMSON FLOOD OF ANGER RAN OVER HIS FACE NONSENSE EH
AND CALLED HIS ATTENTION TO THE COLD BEEF HE REMAINED INSENSIBLE TO THE SUGGESTION WITH HIS CHIN ON HIS BREAST YOU SHOULD FEED YOUR COLD MISSUS VERLOC SAID DOGMATICALLY HE LOOKED UP AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
HE ATE AS IF IN A PUBLIC PLACE HIS HAT PUSHED OFF HIS FOREHEAD THE SKIRTS OF HIS HEAVY OVERCOAT HANGING IN A TRIANGLE ON EACH SIDE OF THE CHAIR
AND BRINGING IN HER BROTHER STEVIE AS SOON AS SHE COULD INTO THE CURRENT OF DOMESTIC EVENTS SHE MENTIONED THAT THE BOY HAD MOPED A GOOD DEAL IT'S ALL ALONG OF MOTHER LEAVING US LIKE THIS MISTER VERLOC NEITHER SAID DAMN
AND SHE WAS SINCERE AND ON EACH SIDE OF HER THIN RED NOSE HER BLEARED MISTY EYES SWAM IN TEARS BECAUSE SHE FELT REALLY THE WANT OF SOME SORT OF STIMULANT IN THE MORNING IN THE PARLOUR
YOU JUST GO ON AND HAVE YOUR WALK OUT DON'T WORRY
AND WITH PEACEFUL PRIDE SHE CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON A CERTAIN RESOLUTION SHE HAD TAKEN A FEW YEARS BEFORE
BECAUSE OF HER RESPECTABILITY AND HER IGNORANCE BUT THE MAN WAS HER HUSBAND NOW AND SHE WAS NO LONGER IGNORANT SHE KEPT IT ON HIM FOR A WHOLE SECOND WITH HER GRAVE FACE MOTIONLESS LIKE A MASK WHILE SHE SAID PLAYFULLY
YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH DON'T YOU OH YES I UNDERSTAND ENGLISH THERE WAS NOTHING FOREIGN IN HIS ACCENT EXCEPT THAT HE SEEMED IN HIS SLOW ENUNCIATION TO BE TAKING PAINS WITH IT
IT WAS IN ALL ESSENTIALS OF DOMESTIC PROPRIETY AND DOMESTIC COMFORT A RESPECTABLE HOME HER DEVOTED AFFECTION MISSED OUT OF IT HER BROTHER STEVIE NOW ENJOYING A DAMP VILLEGIATURE IN THE KENTISH LANES UNDER THE CARE OF MISTER MICHAELIS
BUT MISSUS VERLOC GRATIFIED BY HER BROTHER'S DOCILITY RECOMMENDED HIM NOT TO DIRTY HIS CLOTHES UNDULY IN THE COUNTRY AT THIS STEVIE GAVE HIS SISTER GUARDIAN AND PROTECTOR A LOOK
WITH A THIN NECK AND THE PEAKED SHOULDERS RAISED SLIGHTLY UNDER THE LARGE SEMI TRANSPARENT EARS THE MATERIAL OF THEIR OVERCOATS WAS THE SAME THEIR HATS WERE BLACK AND ROUND IN SHAPE
BUT HE REFRAINED FROM POINTING OUT TO HIS WIFE THAT THE IDEA OF MAKING STEVIE THE COMPANION OF HIS WALKS WAS HER OWN AND NOBODY ELSE'S AT THAT MOMENT TO AN IMPARTIAL OBSERVER MISTER VERLOC WOULD HAVE APPEARED MORE THAN HUMAN IN HIS MAGNANIMITY
BUSY FISHING FOR HIS HAT BUT WHEN HE GOT IT FROM UNDER THE SOFA HE HELD IT AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW THE USE OF A HAT WELL HE'S WAITING FOR YOU SAID MISSUS VERLOC AT LAST I SAY ADOLF
ALREADY MISSUS VERLOC WAS REGRETTING HER WORDS THEY HAD SOUNDED MORE UNKIND THAN SHE MEANT THEM TO BE THEY HAD ALSO THE UNWISDOM OF UNNECESSARY THINGS IN FACT SHE HAD NOT MEANT THEM AT ALL
BUT TALKING ROUND THAT VITAL POINT SHE APPROACHED ABSOLUTE VEHEMENCE IN HER DELIVERY MEANWHILE WITH BRUSQUE MOVEMENTS SHE ARRAYED HERSELF IN AN APRON FOR THE WASHING UP OF CUPS AND AS IF EXCITED BY THE SOUND OF HER UNCONTRADICTED VOICE
HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT AND HIS FACE RED HIS FINGERS HAD RUFFLED HIS HAIR INTO A DISSIPATED UNTIDINESS ALTOGETHER HE HAD A DISREPUTABLE ASPECT EXPRESSIVE OF THE DISCOMFORT THE IRRITATION
AS LONELY AND UNSAFE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SITUATED IN THE MIDST OF A FOREST NO RECEPTACLE SHE COULD THINK OF AMONGST THE SOLID HEAVY FURNITURE SEEMED OTHER BUT FLIMSY AND PARTICULARLY TEMPTING TO HER CONCEPTION OF A HOUSE BREAKER
MISSUS VERLOC SHOOK HER HEAD COMPETENTLY HE WON'T YOU DON'T KNOW HIM THAT BOY JUST WORSHIPS YOU
FRANCE OR CALIFORNIA THE UTTER UNEXPECTEDNESS IMPROBABILITY AND INCONCEIVABLENESS OF SUCH AN EVENT ROBBED THIS VAGUE DECLARATION OF ALL ITS EFFECT
I'LL HAVE YOU LAID UP ON MY HANDS SHE SAID WITH GENUINE UNEASINESS I DON'T THINK SO REMARKED MISTER VERLOC SNUFFLING HUSKILY
IN THE SPIRIT NO DOUBT IN WHICH A MAN INVITES THE ATTENDANCE OF THE HOUSEHOLD DOG THOUGH OF COURSE IN A DIFFERENT MANNER IN THE HOUSE MISTER VERLOC COULD BE DETECTED STARING CURIOUSLY AT STEVIE A GOOD DEAL HIS OWN DEMEANOUR HAD CHANGED
PROPPED UP ON HIS TWO ARMS AS THOUGH HE WERE FEELING GIDDY OR SICK SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ADOLF SHE CALLED OUT HALF ALOUD AND WHEN HE HAD RAISED HIMSELF DO YOU KNOW THAT MAN SHE ASKED RAPIDLY I'VE HEARD OF HIM
SHE WENT INTO THE PARLOUR ON HER WAY TO THE KITCHEN MISTER VERLOC WOULD WANT HIS TEA PRESENTLY CONFIDENT OF THE POWER OF HER CHARMS WINNIE DID NOT EXPECT FROM HER HUSBAND IN THE DAILY INTERCOURSE OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE
DRAW THE MONEY OUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN ALL OF IT YES ALL OF IT MISSUS VERLOC SPREAD OUT WITH CARE THE SCANTY TABLE CLOTH GOT TWO KNIVES AND TWO FORKS OUT OF THE TABLE DRAWER AND SUDDENLY STOPPED IN HER METHODICAL PROCEEDINGS
HAD SOLD SOME WARES HAD SEEN MISTER MICHAELIS SEVERAL TIMES HE HAD TOLD HER THE LAST TIME THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY TO LIVE IN A COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRY SOMEWHERE ON THE LONDON CHATHAM AND DOVER LINE KARL YUNDT
AND THAT ANYHOW HE DID NOT CARE THE PROPOSAL AS TO SLIPPERS WAS DISREGARDED AS BENEATH HIS NOTICE BUT THE QUESTION OF GOING OUT IN THE EVENING RECEIVED AN UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT
SILENT AND WITH HIS HAT RAMMED DOWN UPON HIS FOREHEAD MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE PARLOUR DOOR SHE SAID SERENELY WHAT A WRETCHED DAY YOU'VE BEEN PERHAPS TO SEE STEVIE NO I HAVEN'T SAID MISTER VERLOC SOFTLY
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR MAY WANT IT SOON SNUFFLED VAGUELY MISTER VERLOC WHO WAS COMING TO THE END OF HIS CALCULATED INDISCRETIONS
HE SNUFFLED APOLOGETICALLY AND ADDED I'VE BEEN TO THE BANK MISSUS VERLOC BECAME ATTENTIVE YOU HAVE SHE SAID DISPASSIONATELY WHAT FOR MISTER VERLOC MUMBLED WITH HIS NOSE OVER THE GRATE AND WITH MARKED UNWILLINGNESS
MADE IT APPEAR UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE MEANT TO STRANGLE OR TO EMBRACE HIS WIFE BUT MISSUS VERLOC'S ATTENTION WAS CALLED AWAY FROM THAT MANIFESTATION BY THE CLATTER OF THE SHOP BELL SHOP ADOLF YOU GO HE STOPPED
SHE WENT ROUND THE CORNER TO DRINK ARDENT SPIRITS IN A MEAN AND MUSTY PUBLIC HOUSE THE UNAVOIDABLE STATION ON THE VIA DOLOROSA OF HER LIFE MISSUS VERLOC'S COMMENT UPON THIS PRACTICE
IT WAS A SORT OF PHRASE THAT IS SUGGESTED BY THE DEMON OF PERVERSE INSPIRATION BUT SHE KNEW A WAY TO MAKE IT AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN
YES YES I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT HE DREW OUT OF HIS BREAST POCKET A NEW PIGSKIN POCKET BOOK MISSUS VERLOC RECEIVED IT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND STOOD STILL TILL THE BELL
QUITE FOND OF HIM OF LATE SHE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE WITH HER INFLEXIBLE ASSURANCE MISTER VERLOC TYING UP THE CARDBOARD BOX INTO A PARCEL FOR THE POST BROKE THE STRING BY AN INJUDICIOUS JERK AND MUTTERED SEVERAL SWEAR WORDS CONFIDENTIALLY TO HIMSELF
THE EMBASSY PEOPLE I WOULD CUT THEIR HEARTS OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER BUT LET THEM LOOK OUT I'VE GOT A TONGUE IN MY HEAD HE FUMED PACING UP AND DOWN BETWEEN THE TABLE AND THE SOFA HIS OPEN OVERCOAT CATCHING AGAINST THE ANGLES
GET RID OF THE MAN WHOEVER HE IS AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND COME BACK HOME TO ME YOU WANT LOOKING AFTER FOR A DAY OR TWO MISTER VERLOC CALMED DOWN AND WITH RESOLUTION IMPRINTED ON HIS PALE FACE HAD ALREADY OPENED THE DOOR WHEN HIS WIFE CALLED HIM BACK IN A WHISPER
MISSUS VERLOC WAS STARTLED YOU'VE BEEN GETTING WET SHE SAID NOT VERY MISTER VERLOC MANAGED TO FALTER OUT IN A PROFOUND SHUDDER BY A GREAT EFFORT HE SUPPRESSED THE RATTLING OF HIS TEETH
ONLY HE SUPPOSED HIS WIFE COULD NOT GET ON WITHOUT HIM COULD NOT GET ON WITHOUT HIM REPEATED MISSUS VERLOC SLOWLY I COULDN'T GET ON WITHOUT HIM IF IT WERE FOR HIS GOOD
THROUGH THE DOOR LEFT AJAR SHE COULD SEE THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT GONE YET I FIND I'LL HAVE TO GO OUT THIS EVENING SAID MISTER VERLOC HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO PICK UP HIS OUTER GARMENT
YOUR HUSBAND HAS NOT GONE OUT TO WAIT FOR ME IN THE STREET BY CHANCE IN THE STREET REPEATED MISSUS VERLOC SURPRISED HE COULDN'T THERE'S NO OTHER DOOR TO THE HOUSE
SHE LAID TWO PLATES GOT THE BREAD THE BUTTER
IN THE NORMAL EVOLUTION OF HIS SYMPATHY STEVIE HAD BECOME ANGRY ON DISCOVERING THAT HE HAD NO SHILLING IN HIS POCKET IN HIS INABILITY TO RELIEVE AT ONCE MISSUS NEALE'S LITTLE UNS PRIVATIONS HE FELT THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD BE MADE TO SUFFER FOR IT
THEN HE MURMURED A FEW OMINOUS GENERALITIES ON THE THEME OF NECESSITY WILL HAVE TO
FOR THE THIRD TIME THAT DAY MISTER VERLOC WAS SURPRISED HE STARED STUPIDLY AT HIS WIFE SHE CONTINUED IN HER STEADY MANNER THE BOY WHENEVER HE WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING MOPED IN THE HOUSE
THEN RAISING HIS TONE TO THE USUAL HUSKY MUTTER HE ANNOUNCED HIS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE STEVIE INTO THE COUNTRY HIMSELF AND LEAVE HIM ALL SAFE WITH MICHAELIS HE CARRIED OUT THIS SCHEME ON THE VERY NEXT DAY
HAD AN UNEXPECTED PROFUNDITY AS COMING FROM A PERSON DISINCLINED TO LOOK UNDER THE SURFACE OF THINGS OF COURSE WHAT IS SHE TO DO TO KEEP UP IF I WERE LIKE MISSUS NEALE I EXPECT I WOULDN'T ACT ANY DIFFERENT
WITH SOMBRE AVERSION WHEN URGED BY MISSUS VERLOC WHO SAID AT LAST AREN'T YOUR FEET WET YOU HAD BETTER PUT ON YOUR SLIPPERS YOU AREN'T GOING OUT ANY MORE THIS EVENING MISTER VERLOC INTIMATED BY MOROSE GRUNTS AND SIGNS THAT HIS FEET WERE NOT WET
BECAUSE IF HE HAD NOT BEEN MISTER VERLOC WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM INSIDE UNDOING THE STRINGS OF HER APRON WITH A JERK SHE THREW IT ON A CHAIR AND WALKED BACK TO THE PARLOUR SLOWLY AT THAT PRECISE MOMENT MISTER VERLOC ENTERED FROM THE SHOP
YOU'D THINK HE COULDN'T DO ENOUGH FOR US MISTER VERLOC DIRECTED A CASUAL AND SOMNOLENT GLANCE AT STEVIE WHO SAT ON HIS RIGHT DELICATE PALE FACED HIS ROSY MOUTH OPEN VACANTLY IT WAS NOT A CRITICAL GLANCE IT HAD NO INTENTION
AND SHE FOLLOWED IT WITH THE EVERLASTING PLAINT OF THE POOR PATHETICALLY MENDACIOUS MISERABLY AUTHENTICATED BY THE HORRIBLE BREATH OF CHEAP RUM AND SOAP SUDS SHE SCRUBBED HARD SNUFFLING ALL THE TIME AND TALKING VOLUBLY
AT HER MOTIONLESS HUSBAND HUGGING THE FIRE SHE WENT DOWN TWO STEPS INTO THE KITCHEN IT WAS ONLY WHEN COMING BACK CARVING KNIFE AND FORK IN HAND
AND MISSUS VERLOC IN HER VARIED EXPERIENCE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SOME FOREIGNERS COULD SPEAK BETTER ENGLISH THAN THE NATIVES SHE SAID LOOKING AT THE DOOR OF THE PARLOUR FIXEDLY YOU DON'T THINK PERHAPS OF STAYING IN ENGLAND FOR GOOD
TALKED OF THE EMBASSY TO YOU MISTER VERLOC SEEMED SCARED AND BEWILDERED BEYOND MEASURE HIS WIFE EXPLAINED YOU'VE BEEN TALKING A LITTLE IN YOUR SLEEP OF LATE ADOLF WHAT WHAT DID I SAY WHAT DO YOU KNOW
PEEPED IN TO SEE THAT THE CONTENTS WERE ALL RIGHT AND PUT IT DOWN GENTLY ON THE COUNTER NOT TILL THAT WAS DONE DID HE BREAK THE SILENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT MOST LIKELY STEVIE WOULD PROFIT GREATLY BY BEING SENT OUT OF TOWN FOR A WHILE
YOU COULD DO ANYTHING WITH THAT BOY ADOLF MISSUS VERLOC SAID WITH HER BEST AIR OF INFLEXIBLE CALMNESS HE WOULD GO THROUGH FIRE FOR YOU HE SHE PAUSED ATTENTIVE HER EAR TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR OF THE KITCHEN
MISTER VERLOC UNCOVERED HIS HEAD BEFORE HIS EXTENDED ARM COULD PUT DOWN THE HAT STEVIE POUNCED UPON IT AND BORE IT OFF REVERENTLY INTO THE KITCHEN AND AGAIN MISTER VERLOC WAS SURPRISED
WALKED IN BEHIND THE COUNTER SHE DID NOT LOOK OVERTLY AT THE CUSTOMER TILL SHE HAD ESTABLISHED HERSELF COMFORTABLY ON THE CHAIR BUT BY THAT TIME SHE HAD NOTED THAT HE WAS TALL AND THIN AND WORE HIS MOUSTACHES TWISTED UP
YOU COULDN'T YOU WOULD MISS ME TOO MUCH MISTER VERLOC STARTED FORWARD EXACTLY HE SAID IN A LOUDER TONE THROWING HIS ARMS OUT AND MAKING A STEP TOWARDS HER SOMETHING WILD AND DOUBTFUL IN HIS EXPRESSION
THE STRANGER GAVE HER AGAIN A SILENT SMILE HE HAD A KINDLY MOUTH AND PROBING EYES AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD A LITTLE SADLY IT SEEMED MY HUSBAND WILL SEE YOU THROUGH ALL RIGHT MEANTIME FOR A
HE HAD CERTAINLY CONTRIVED SOMEHOW TO CATCH AN ABOMINABLE COLD BETWEEN SEVEN IN THE MORNING AND FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON MISSUS VERLOC LOOKED AT HIS BOWED BACK WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN TO DAY SHE ASKED NOWHERE
IT WAS EARLY MORNING STEVIE DUSTING VARIOUS OBJECTS DISPLAYED IN THE FRONT WINDOWS TURNED TO GAPE AT HIM WITH REVERENCE AND AWE HERE SAID MISTER VERLOC GIVING A SLIGHT KICK TO THE GLADSTONE BAG ON THE FLOOR
HAD DONE NO WEAVING DURING HER HUSBAND'S ABSENCE
MISSUS VERLOC OBSERVED WITH KNOWLEDGE THERE'S MISSUS NEALE AT IT AGAIN WITH HER HARROWING TALES ABOUT HER LITTLE CHILDREN
DURING HIS WALKS MISTER VERLOC OF COURSE MET AND CONVERSED WITH VARIOUS PERSONS IT COULD HARDLY BE OTHERWISE HIS WALKS WERE AN INTEGRAL PART OF HIS OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES WHICH HIS WIFE HAD NEVER LOOKED DEEPLY INTO
HE WAS FOND OF HIS WIFE AS A MAN SHOULD BE THAT IS GENEROUSLY BUT A WEIGHTY OBJECTION PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIS MIND AND HE FORMULATED IT HE'LL LOSE SIGHT OF ME PERHAPS AND GET LOST IN THE STREET HE SAID
SHE SAID AFTER A TIME THE LONG THIN STRANGER WITHOUT EXACTLY LOOKING AT MISSUS VERLOC ANSWERED ONLY BY A FAINT AND PECULIAR SMILE MISSUS VERLOC'S STEADY INCURIOUS GAZE RESTED ON HIM
PRESERVED A HIERATIC IMMOBILITY WHEN THE PRESSURE WAS REMOVED HE LET GO THE CHAIR ROSE AND WENT TO STAND BEFORE THE FIREPLACE HE TURNED NO LONGER HIS BACK TO THE ROOM WITH HIS FEATURES SWOLLEN AND AN AIR OF BEING DRUGGED
IT WAS NOT OF GOING OUT IN THE EVENING THAT MISTER VERLOC WAS THINKING HIS THOUGHTS EMBRACED A VASTER SCHEME FROM MOODY AND INCOMPLETE PHRASES IT BECAME APPARENT THAT MISTER VERLOC HAD BEEN CONSIDERING THE EXPEDIENCY OF EMIGRATING
MISSUS VERLOC ROSE AND WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TO STOP THAT NONSENSE AND SHE DID IT FIRMLY BUT GENTLY SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT DIRECTLY MISSUS NEALE RECEIVED HER MONEY
YOU'VE A BAD COLD IT WAS INDEED OBVIOUS THAT MISTER VERLOC WAS NOT IN HIS USUAL STATE PHYSICALLY AND EVEN MENTALLY A SOMBRE IRRESOLUTION HELD HIM SILENT FOR A WHILE
CARRIED THE TRAY INTO THE KITCHEN SHE WASHED THE CUPS AND SOME OTHER THINGS BEFORE SHE STOPPED IN HER WORK TO LISTEN NO SOUND REACHED HER THE CUSTOMER WAS A LONG TIME IN THE SHOP IT WAS A CUSTOMER
YOU KNOW YOU DO GET YOURSELF VERY UNTIDY WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE STEVIE MISTER VERLOC WAS ALREADY GONE SOME WAY DOWN THE STREET THUS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER MOTHER'S HEROIC PROCEEDINGS AND OF HER BROTHER'S ABSENCE ON THIS VILLEGIATURE
SHE CONGRATULATED HERSELF STILL MORE ON OBSERVING IN THE COURSE OF DAYS THAT MISTER VERLOC SEEMED TO BE TAKING KINDLY TO STEVIE'S COMPANIONSHIP NOW WHEN READY TO GO OUT FOR HIS WALK MISTER VERLOC CALLED ALOUD TO THE BOY
AND THIS RESEMBLANCE TO A MECHANICAL FIGURE WENT SO FAR THAT HE HAD AN AUTOMATON'S ABSURD AIR OF BEING AWARE OF THE MACHINERY INSIDE OF HIM HE CLOSED THE PARLOUR DOOR AND MISSUS VERLOC MOVING BRISKLY
IT MADE HER UNEASY IT MADE HER NERVOUS SHE CONFESSED AND THAT FROM THE CALM WINNIE SOUNDED LIKE EXAGGERATION BUT IN TRUTH
SHE CONDEMNED IT FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW BUT HER ONLY REAL CONCERN WAS STEVIE'S WELFARE HE APPEARED TO HER THOUGHT IN THAT CONNECTION AS SUFFICIENTLY PECULIAR NOT TO BE TAKEN RASHLY ABROAD AND THAT WAS ALL
STEVIE OFFERED NO OBJECTION HE SEEMED RATHER EAGER IN A BEWILDERED SORT OF WAY HE TURNED HIS CANDID GAZE INQUISITIVELY TO MISTER VERLOC'S HEAVY COUNTENANCE AT FREQUENT INTERVALS ESPECIALLY WHEN HIS SISTER WAS NOT LOOKING AT HIM
WINNIE LEANED ON HIS SHOULDER FROM BEHIND AND PRESSED HER LIPS TO HIS FOREHEAD THUS SHE LINGERED NOT A WHISPER REACHED THEM FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON THE PAVEMENT DIED OUT IN THE DISCREET DIMNESS OF THE SHOP
MISSUS VERLOC FOUND HERSELF OFTENER THAN USUAL ALL ALONE NOT ONLY IN THE SHOP BUT IN THE HOUSE FOR MISTER VERLOC HAD TO TAKE HIS WALKS SHE WAS ALONE LONGER THAN USUAL ON THE DAY OF THE ATTEMPTED BOMB OUTRAGE IN GREENWICH PARK
AND HIS FEET PLANTED INSIDE THE FENDER HIS HEAD HELD BETWEEN HIS HANDS HE WAS HANGING LOW OVER THE GLOWING GRATE HIS TEETH RATTLED WITH AN UNGOVERNABLE VIOLENCE CAUSING HIS WHOLE ENORMOUS BACK TO TREMBLE AT THE SAME RATE
SOME OF THEM MUST BE BIG ENOUGH BY NOW TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING FOR THEMSELVES IT ONLY MAKES STEVIE ANGRY THESE WORDS WERE CONFIRMED BY A THUD AS OF A FIST STRIKING THE KITCHEN TABLE
SHE DID NOT LOOK FOR COURTESIES FROM HIM BUT HE WAS A GOOD HUSBAND AND SHE HAD A LOYAL RESPECT FOR HIS RIGHTS MISSUS VERLOC WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PARLOUR AND ON TO HER DOMESTIC DUTIES IN THE KITCHEN
LIKE MISTER VERLOC FOR INSTANCE WINNIE AT THE SHOP DOOR DID NOT SEE THIS FATAL ATTENDANT UPON MISTER VERLOC'S WALKS SHE WATCHED THE TWO FIGURES DOWN THE SQUALID STREET ONE TALL AND BURLY THE OTHER SLIGHT AND SHORT
THEN LEFT HER SEAT TO GO AND PEEP THROUGH THE GLAZED DOOR SUDDENLY SHE OPENED IT AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE PARLOUR MISTER VERLOC HAD DONE NO MORE THAN PUT ON HIS OVERCOAT
THE IDEA OF COURSE I CAN GET ON WITHOUT HIM BUT THERE'S NOWHERE FOR HIM TO GO MISTER VERLOC GOT OUT SOME BROWN PAPER AND A BALL OF STRING AND MEANWHILE HE MUTTERED THAT MICHAELIS WAS LIVING IN A LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRY
HE TURNED AWAY HIS HEAVY EYES SAYING HUSKILY WELL LET HIM COME ALONG THEN AND RELAPSED INTO THE CLUTCHES OF BLACK CARE THAT PERHAPS PREFERS TO SIT BEHIND A HORSEMAN BUT KNOWS ALSO HOW TO TREAD CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF PEOPLE NOT SUFFICIENTLY WELL OFF TO KEEP HORSES
HE HAD GONE IN RED HE CAME OUT A STRANGE PAPERY WHITE HIS FACE LOSING ITS DRUGGED FEVERISH STUPOR HAD IN THAT SHORT TIME ACQUIRED A BEWILDERED AND HARASSED EXPRESSION
ANSWERED MISTER VERLOC IN A LOW CHOKED NASAL TONE HIS ATTITUDE SUGGESTED AGGRIEVED SULKS OR A SEVERE HEADACHE THE UNSUFFICIENCY AND UNCANDIDNESS OF HIS ANSWER BECAME PAINFULLY APPARENT IN THE DEAD SILENCE OF THE ROOM
NOR YET STEVIE BE HANGED AND MISSUS VERLOC NOT LET INTO THE SECRET OF HIS THOUGHTS FAILED TO APPRECIATE THE GENEROSITY OF THIS RESTRAINT IT ISN'T THAT HE DOESN'T WORK AS WELL AS EVER SHE CONTINUED HE'S BEEN MAKING HIMSELF VERY USEFUL
THIS OPTIMISM PROCURED FOR MISTER VERLOC HIS FOURTH SURPRISE OF THE DAY IS HE HE GRUNTED DOUBTFULLY BUT PERHAPS HIS BROTHER IN LAW WAS NOT SUCH AN IDIOT AS HE LOOKED HIS WIFE WOULD KNOW BEST
MISTER VERLOC AGAINST HIS USUAL PRACTICE HAD THROWN OFF HIS OVERCOAT IT WAS LYING ON THE SOFA HIS HAT WHICH HE MUST ALSO HAVE THROWN OFF RESTED OVERTURNED UNDER THE EDGE OF THE SOFA
ON THE POINT OF TAKING OUT THE JAM SHE REFLECTED PRACTICALLY HE WILL BE FEELING HUNGRY HAVING BEEN AWAY ALL DAY AND SHE RETURNED TO THE CUPBOARD ONCE MORE TO GET THE COLD BEEF SHE SET IT UNDER THE PURRING GAS JET AND WITH A PASSING GLANCE
IT ONLY EXCITED THE POOR BOY BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HELP THEM BEING SO
HE TOOK DOWN A SMALL
THE RED FLOOD OF ANGER EBBED OUT AND LEFT HIS FACE ALL WHITE WITH QUIVERING NOSTRILS MISSUS VERLOC FOR THE PURPOSES OF PRACTICAL EXISTENCE PUT DOWN THESE APPEARANCES TO THE COLD WELL SHE SAID
FEW DAYS YOU COULDN'T DO BETTER THAN TAKE LODGINGS WITH MISTER GIUGLIANI CONTINENTAL HOTEL IT'S CALLED PRIVATE IT'S QUIET MY HUSBAND WILL TAKE YOU THERE A GOOD IDEA SAID THE THIN DARK MAN WHOSE GLANCE HAD HARDENED SUDDENLY
SHE WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY IN A TONE ALMOST TART IF YOU GO ABROAD YOU'LL HAVE TO GO WITHOUT ME YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T SAID MISTER VERLOC HUSKILY AND THE UNRESONANT VOICE OF HIS PRIVATE LIFE TREMBLED WITH AN ENIGMATICAL EMOTION
HE FOLLOWED HIS WIFE'S MOVEMENTS WITH HIS EYES MISSUS VERLOC WENT ABOUT SERENELY CLEARING UP THE TABLE HER TRANQUIL VOICE COMMENTED THE IDEA THROWN OUT IN A REASONABLE AND DOMESTIC TONE IT WOULDN'T STAND EXAMINATION
STRIKING A MATCH ON THE BOX SHE HELD IN HER HAND SHE TURNED ON AND LIGHTED ABOVE THE PARLOUR TABLE ONE OF THE TWO GAS BURNERS WHICH BEING DEFECTIVE FIRST WHISTLED AS IF ASTONISHED AND THEN WENT ON PURRING COMFORTABLY LIKE A CAT
GREW UPON HER HEARING BIZARRE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE IT ARRESTED MISSUS VERLOC'S ATTENTION THEN AS ITS CHARACTER BECAME PLAIN TO THE EAR SHE STOPPED SHORT AMAZED AND CONCERNED
SITTING BEHIND THE COUNTER WITH SOME SEWING SHE DID NOT RAISE HER EYES FROM HER WORK WHEN MISTER VERLOC ENTERED IN THE AGGRESSIVE CLATTER OF THE BELL SHE HAD RECOGNISED HIS STEP ON THE PAVEMENT OUTSIDE SHE DID NOT RAISE HER EYES BUT AS MISTER VERLOC
A CEREMONIOUS AMENITY OF ADDRESS AND COURTLINESS OF MANNER VAIN AND ANTIQUATED FORMS AT BEST PROBABLY NEVER VERY EXACTLY OBSERVED DISCARDED NOWADAYS EVEN IN THE HIGHEST SPHERES AND ALWAYS FOREIGN TO THE STANDARDS OF HER CLASS
COVERED WITH BROWN OIL CLOTH WINNIE HIS WIFE TALKED EVENLY AT HIM THE WIFELY TALK AS ARTFULLY ADAPTED NO DOUBT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS RETURN AS THE TALK OF PENELOPE TO THE RETURN OF THE WANDERING ODYSSEUS MISSUS VERLOC HOWEVER
THIS WAS A CHANGE BUT IT WAS NO IMPROVEMENT MISSUS VERLOC INCLUDING ALL THESE VAGARIES UNDER THE GENERAL DEFINITION OF EXCITEMENT BEGAN TO FEAR THAT STEVIE WAS HEARING MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM OF HER HUSBAND'S CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS FRIENDS
AND IF MISTER VERLOC THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT HIS WIFE'S BROTHER LOOKED UNCOMMONLY USELESS IT WAS ONLY A DULL AND FLEETING THOUGHT DEVOID OF THAT FORCE AND DURABILITY WHICH ENABLES SOMETIMES A THOUGHT TO MOVE THE WORLD LEANING BACK
THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE DIED BEFORE HE ADMITTED IT TO DORA NOW THAT THE EXHILARATION OF TRUANT DELIGHTS HAD DIED AWAY HIS CONSCIENCE WAS BEGINNING TO GIVE HIM SALUTARY TWINGES
WHEN I'M THROUGH REDMOND I'LL STICK TO TEACHING I CAN TEACH I CAN'T WRITE STORIES
THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THAT REPORT SAID DIANA BLUSHING WELL DON'T PUT IT OFF TOO LONG SAID AUNT ATOSSA SIGNIFICANTLY YOU'LL FADE SOON YOU'RE ALL COMPLEXION AND HAIR AND THE WRIGHTS ARE TERRIBLE FICKLE
I WONDER YOUR MOTHER ALLOWS YOU BUT SHE ALWAYS SPOILED YOU WE ALL THOUGHT WHEN GEORGE MARRIED HER SHE WOULDN'T BE A SUITABLE WIFE FOR HIM AUNT ATOSSA SIGHED HEAVILY AS IF ALL FOREBODINGS UPON THE OCCASION OF GEORGE BARRY'S MARRIAGE HAD BEEN AMPLY AND DARKLY FULFILLED
SHE HAD ACHIEVED HER PATHETIC SCENE WITHOUT SACRIFICING ROBERT RAY AND SHE KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE ON DIANA AS SHE READ IT DIANA ROSE TO THE OCCASION AND CRIED PROPERLY BUT WHEN THE END CAME SHE LOOKED A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
BUT YOU LIKE TO CRY OVER STORIES OH YES IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM BUT I LIKE EVERYTHING TO COME RIGHT AT LAST I MUST HAVE ONE PATHETIC SCENE IN IT
I'M AFRAID THAT IS TOO ARISTOCRATIC A NAME FOR A CHORE BOY DIANA
MISSUS LYNDE HAD MENDED THEM BEAUTIFULLY AND NEVER SAID A WORD TO MARILLA ABOUT THEM BUT DAVY'S CUP OF INIQUITY WAS NOT YET FULL
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OF LATE YEARS THEY HAD GROWN APART BUT THE OLD TIE OF SCHOOL GIRL INTIMACY WAS THERE AND MADE ITSELF FELT SHARPLY IN THE TUG THE NEWS GAVE AT ANNE'S HEARTSTRINGS RUBY THE BRILLIANT THE MERRY THE COQUETTISH
FAR FROM WELL CONTINUED AUNT ATOSSA SOLEMNLY BUT STILL I KEEP A DOING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T WORK AREN'T WANTED HERE IF IT ISN'T TOO MUCH TROUBLE WILL YOU BE CONDESCENDING ENOUGH TO SET THE JELLY IN THE PANTRY
BUT SHE SAYS SHE'S GOING TO TEACH AGAIN IN THE FALL AND SHE'S AFTER THE WHITE SANDS SCHOOL SHE'LL BE IN HER GRAVE POOR GIRL WHEN WHITE SANDS SCHOOL OPENS THAT'S WHAT ANNE LISTENED IN SHOCKED SILENCE RUBY GILLIS HER OLD SCHOOL CHUM DYING
SHE EXPECTED THAT DAVY WOULD BE STRUCK DOWN DEAD ON THE SPOT BUT NOTHING HAPPENED ANYWAY
DAVY KNEW THEY MUST GO HE DISCARDED TOMMY'S OVERALLS RESUMED HIS OWN RIGHTFUL ATTIRE AND TURNED AWAY FROM HIS STRING OF TROUT WITH A SIGH NO USE TO THINK OF TAKING THEM HOME WELL HADN'T WE A SPLENDID TIME
YOU BET SAID DAVY EMPHATICALLY THAT WAS YOUR CONSCIENCE PUNISHING YOU DAVY
AND THRILL TO THE SUNSHINE AND RAIN THAT HAD DRIFTED OVER THEM THE AIR WAS FRAGRANT WITH THE WILD SWEET WHOLESOME SMELL OF YOUNG RASPBERRY COPSES WHITE MISTS WERE HOVERING IN THE SILENT HOLLOWS AND VIOLET STARS WERE SHINING BLUELY ON THE BROOKLANDS
SHE CEASED NOT FROM CUTTING SETS WITH MUCH ENERGY
I HEARD PRISCILLA SAY ONCE THAT ALL MISSUS MORGAN'S FIRST STORIES WERE REJECTED BUT I'M SURE YOURS WOULDN'T BE ANNE FOR IT'S LIKELY EDITORS HAVE MORE SENSE NOWADAYS MARGARET BURTON ONE OF THE JUNIOR GIRLS AT REDMOND WROTE A STORY LAST WINTER
WHY DID YOU KILL MAURICE LENNOX SHE ASKED REPROACHFULLY HE WAS THE VILLAIN PROTESTED ANNE HE HAD TO BE PUNISHED I LIKE HIM BEST OF THEM ALL SAID UNREASONABLE DIANA
BUT FINALLY I GOT A PLOT THAT MATCHED HER THEN CAME THE EXCITEMENT OF CHOOSING NAMES FOR ALL MY CHARACTERS YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW FASCINATING THAT IS I'VE LAIN AWAKE FOR HOURS THINKING OVER THOSE NAMES THE HERO'S NAME IS PERCEVAL DALRYMPLE
BUT SHE PROMISED TO GO AND DIANA OFFERED TO GO WITH HER
SAID MISTER HARRISON I DON'T BELIEVE IN PUTTING MARRYING OFF TOO LONG LIKE I DID
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS YOU WOULDN'T DARE SAY BEFORE EVERYBODY
AND DAVY HURLED CENT AND NICKEL
MISSUS LYNDE LIMPED OUT OF HER KITCHEN AS HE JOINED DORA ARE YOU CLEAN SHE DEMANDED SEVERELY
AND THE MINISTER WHO HADN'T HEARD A WORD SHE SAID IMMEDIATELY REMARKED IN A VERY DEVOUT VOICE
CHANGING THE NAME OF COURSE OR ELSE MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WOULD PROBABLY THINK SHE WAS THE HEROINE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSOCIATE THE THOUGHT OF HER WITH ANYTHING LIKE DEATH SHE HAD GREETED ANNE WITH GAY CORDIALITY AFTER CHURCH AND URGED HER TO COME UP THE NEXT EVENING I'LL BE AWAY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY EVENINGS SHE HAD WHISPERED TRIUMPHANTLY
BUT HER TONGUE IS SHARPER STILL LATE AS IT WAS AUNT ATOSSA WAS CUTTING POTATO SETS IN THE WRIGHT KITCHEN SHE WORE A FADED OLD WRAPPER AND HER GRAY HAIR WAS DECIDEDLY UNTIDY AUNT ATOSSA DID NOT LIKE BEING CAUGHT IN A KILTER
YES'M QUAKINGLY WAS PRAYER MEETING I I DON'T KNOW YOU SHOULD KNOW YOU SHOULD LISTEN MORE ATTENTIVELY TO THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WHAT WAS MISTER HARVEY'S TEXT DAVY TOOK A FRANTIC GULP OF WATER
PROTESTED DORA YOU'VE GOT TO SAID DAVY IF YOU DON'T COME I'LL TELL MARILLA THAT FRANK BELL KISSED YOU IN SCHOOL LAST MONDAY
YESTERDAY WAS REAL DINKY BUT I LIKE SOMETHING BRIGHTER FOR MYSELF DID YOU NOTICE THOSE TWO RIDICULOUS BOYS DOWNSTAIRS THEY'VE BOTH COME DETERMINED TO SIT EACH OTHER OUT I DON'T CARE A SINGLE BIT ABOUT EITHER OF THEM YOU KNOW HERB SPENCER IS THE ONE I LIKE
AT LEAST THE COTTONS CERTAINLY HAD AND DAVY SEEMED TO HAVE IT NOT BEING ENTIRELY BEREFT OF PRUDENCE
BUT HIS SOUL SEETHED WITHIN DAVY HAD SUFFERED OR THOUGHT HE HAD SUFFERED MANY THINGS AT THE HANDS AND TONGUE OF MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE SINCE SHE HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES FOR MISSUS LYNDE COULD NOT LIVE WITH ANYBODY WHETHER THEY WERE NINE OR NINETY
IT'S JUST WHAT ANYBODY MIGHT DO HEROINES SHOULDN'T DO COOKING I THINK WHY THAT IS WHERE THE HUMOR COMES IN AND IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE WHOLE STORY SAID ANNE AND IT MAY BE STATED THAT IN THIS SHE WAS QUITE RIGHT
RUBY WAS DRESSED IN WHITE AND HER EYES AND CHEEKS WERE VERY BRILLIANT
THOUGH MISSUS LYNDE BELIEVES WE'RE ALL BAD BUT MOST OF US HAVE GOT A LITTLE DECENCY SOMEWHERE IN US KEEP ON WRITING ANNE NO
I'D FEEL AS IF I HAD A SHARE IN THE STORY THEN YOU MAY NAME THE LITTLE HIRED BOY WHO LIVED WITH THE LESTERS CONCEDED ANNE HE IS NOT VERY IMPORTANT BUT HE IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNNAMED CALL HIM RAYMOND
AND HAILED DAVY'S APPEARANCE WITH WHOOPS OF DELIGHT PETE TOMMY ADOLPHUS AND MIRABEL COTTON WERE ALL ALONE THEIR MOTHER AND OLDER SISTERS WERE AWAY DORA WAS THANKFUL MIRABEL WAS THERE AT LEAST
YOU USED TO WRITE PERFECTLY THRILLING STORIES YEARS AGO IN OUR OLD STORY CLUB
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET SAID DIANA
SHE'D HAVE REFORMED HIM YOU CAN REFORM A MAN
COME ALONE I WANT YOU ARE YOU FEELING QUITE WELL RUBY
WHO AS MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE SAID HAD ACTUALLY MANAGED TO DIE AT LAST AFTER PRACTICING AT IT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND OLD JOSIAH SLOANE WHOM NOBODY KNEW IN HIS COFFIN BECAUSE HE HAD HIS WHISKERS NEATLY TRIMMED
DON'T FORGET THE GOLDEN TEXT DON'T LOSE YOUR COLLECTION OR FORGET TO PUT IT IN DON'T WHISPER AT PRAYER TIME AND DON'T FORGET TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE SERMON DAVY DEIGNED NO RESPONSE HE MARCHED AWAY DOWN THE LANE FOLLOWED BY THE MEEK DORA
THERE IS TOO WOULD YOU DEMANDED DORA GRAVELY WOULD YOU SAY TOMCAT BEFORE THE MINISTER THIS WAS A STAGGERER DAVY WAS NOT PREPARED FOR SUCH A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH
IS RUBY GILLIS ILL ANNE ASKED OF MISSUS LYNDE AS THEY WENT HOME FROM CHURCH RUBY GILLIS IS DYING OF GALLOPING CONSUMPTION
WHITE CURTAINS AROUND IT ANNE ROUSED HERSELF FROM HER REVERIE WITH A HAPPY SIGH I WAS THINKING OUT MY STORY DIANA OH HAVE YOU REALLY BEGUN IT CRIED DIANA ALL ALIGHT WITH EAGER INTEREST IN A MOMENT
THOMAS PUSSY SAID DAVY I THINK GENTLEMAN CAT WOULD BE MORE POLITE REFLECTED DORA YOU THINKING RETORTED DAVY WITH WITHERING SCORN DAVY WAS NOT FEELING COMFORTABLE
WHAT DID YOU DO OH I'M AFRAID TO TELL YOU YOU'LL NEVER LIKE ME AGAIN ANNE
IN HER LITERARY PURSUITS NOW SHE WOULD BE JUBILANT OVER A BRILLIANT IDEA NOW DESPAIRING BECAUSE SOME CONTRARY CHARACTER WOULD NOT BEHAVE PROPERLY DIANA COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MAKE THEM DO AS YOU WANT THEM TO SHE SAID
ANNE DROPPED HER LIDS TO HIDE HER DANCING EYES SHE RECALLED THE STORMY WINTER NIGHT OF THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WHEN JANE HAD PROPOSED FOR BILLY HE CERTAINLY HAD NOT BROKEN HIS HEART OVER HIS REJECTION ANNE WONDERED IF JANE HAD ALSO PROPOSED TO NETTIE FOR HIM
DO TO ME HE WHISPERED NOTHING DEAR YOU'VE BEEN PUNISHED ALREADY I THINK
HAVE YOU FORGIVEN ME ANNE YES DEAR
GOD WILL PUNISH YOU IF YOU DO SAID DORA SOLEMNLY THEN I
AND YOU'LL NEVER BE BAD LIKE THAT AGAIN
OH ISN'T SHE DREADFUL GASPED DIANA AS THEY ESCAPED DOWN THE LANE SHE'S WORSE THAN MISS ELIZA ANDREWS SAID ANNE
THE ROUND OF LIFE ANNE WAS BACK IN AVONLEA WITH THE LUSTER OF THE THORBURN SCHOLARSHIP ON HER BROW
HE BELONGS TO ME AND I WANT HIM TO LIVE AND FLOURISH
I RUN AWAY FROM SUNDAY SCHOOL AND WENT FISHING WITH THE COTTONS
BUT FATHER PUT HIS FOOT DOWN LIVE WITH AUNT ATOSSA HE WOULD NOT IS SHE SO TERRIBLE ASKED ANNE ABSENTLY YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE WHAT SHE'S LIKE BEFORE WE CAN GET AWAY SAID DIANA SIGNIFICANTLY FATHER SAYS SHE HAS A FACE LIKE A HATCHET IT CUTS THE AIR
SMILED ANNE I DO IT YET LAUGHED DIANA
I WISH THOSE TWO BOYS HADN'T COME TONIGHT
HE HAD A CENT IN HIS POCKET FOR THE SUNDAY SCHOOL COLLECTION AND A FIVE CENT PIECE FOR THE CHURCH COLLECTION HE CARRIED HIS BIBLE IN ONE HAND AND HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL QUARTERLY IN THE OTHER HE KNEW HIS LESSON AND HIS GOLDEN TEXT
OUT CAME THE SUNSET BUT IN SPITE OF THIS HEROIC MUTILATION THE EDITOR OF THE CANADIAN WOMAN SENT AVERIL'S ATONEMENT BACK SO PROMPTLY
OH I LIKE HAPPY ENDINGS BEST YOU'D BETTER LET HIM MARRY HER SAID DIANA
DON'T YOU TELL ME BUT IT WAS NOT AT JANE ANNE GAZED THAT DAY IN DISMAY AND SURPRISE IT WAS AT RUBY GILLIS WHO SAT BESIDE HER IN THE CHOIR WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO RUBY
I'VE LEFT OUT ALL THE DESCRIPTIONS BUT THE SUNSET SHE SAID AT LAST I SIMPLY COULDN'T LET IT GO IT WAS THE BEST OF THEM ALL IT HASN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY SAID MISTER HARRISON
I'M AWFUL GLAD YOU'RE HOME I COULDN'T GO TO SLEEP TILL I'D TOLD SOMEBODY TOLD SOMEBODY WHAT HOW MIS'RUBUL I AM WHY ARE YOU MISERABLE DEAR
HE DEMANDED DEFIANTLY AS THEY WENT DOWN THE HILL FIELD I HADN'T SAID DORA FLATLY AND I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAD REALLY EITHER SHE ADDED WITH A FLASH OF INSIGHT THAT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED OF HER I HAD SO
THEY DARED NOT OF COURSE GO FISHING ON THE POND WHERE THEY WOULD BE SEEN BY PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH THEY HAD TO RESORT TO THE BROOK IN THE WOODS BEHIND THE COTTON HOUSE BUT IT WAS FULL OF TROUT AND THEY HAD A GLORIOUS TIME THAT MORNING
I SUPPOSE THE EDITOR IS PREJUDICED AGAINST ANY ONE WHO ISN'T A YANKEE DON'T BE DISCOURAGED ANNE REMEMBER HOW MISSUS MORGAN'S STORIES CAME BACK SEND YOURS TO THE CANADIAN WOMAN I BELIEVE I WILL SAID ANNE PLUCKING UP HEART AND IF IT IS PUBLISHED
SHE'S FIGHTING SO HARD FOR HER LIFE AND YET SHE HASN'T ANY CHANCE AT ALL THEY SAY THE GIRLS WALKED SILENTLY DOWN THE RED TWILIT ROAD THE ROBINS WERE SINGING VESPERS IN THE HIGH TREETOPS FILLING THE GOLDEN AIR WITH THEIR JUBILANT VOICES
WOULD WIN ANY GIRL'S HEART COMPLETELY
DID YOU SAY YOUR GOLDEN TEXT AND CATECHISM YES'M DID YOU PUT YOUR COLLECTION IN YES'M WAS MISSUS MALCOLM MAC PHERSON IN CHURCH I DON'T KNOW THIS AT LEAST WAS THE TRUTH THOUGHT WRETCHED DAVY WAS THE LADIES
I CALL IT AVERIL'S ATONEMENT DOESN'T THAT SOUND NICE AND ALLITERATIVE NOW DIANA TELL ME CANDIDLY DO YOU SEE ANY FAULTS IN MY STORY WELL
IF WE COULD SAIL TO IT IN THE MOONSHINE BOAT PAUL WROTE OF IN HIS OLD COMPOSITION YOU REMEMBER HOW NICE IT WOULD BE SAID ANNE ROUSING FROM HER REVERIE
DAVY WOULD LIKELY TAKE TO HIS HEELS AND SHE COULD NOT PURSUE HIM TODAY WELL BE SURE YOU BEHAVE YOURSELVES SHE WARNED THEM DON'T WALK IN THE DUST DON'T STOP IN THE PORCH TO TALK TO THE OTHER CHILDREN DON'T SQUIRM OR WRIGGLE IN YOUR PLACES
OR IF HE HAD MUSTERED ENOUGH SPUNK TO ASK THE FATEFUL QUESTION HIMSELF ALL THE ANDREWS FAMILY SEEMED TO SHARE IN HIS PRIDE AND PLEASURE FROM MISSUS HARMON IN THE PEW TO JANE IN THE CHOIR
COULDN'T YOU HAVE CHANGED HER NAME NO THE THING WAS IMPOSSIBLE I TRIED TO BUT I COULDN'T DO IT ANY MORE THAN I COULD CHANGE YOURS
THERE WAS SILENCE
INSTEAD HERE SHE WAS ROAMING THE WOODS WITH THOSE HALF WILD COTTONS TRYING TO KEEP HER BOOTS CLEAN AND HER PRETTY WHITE DRESS FREE FROM RENTS AND STAINS MIRABEL HAD OFFERED THE LOAN OF AN APRON BUT DORA HAD SCORNFULLY REFUSED
YES I HAVE ONLY A FEW PAGES WRITTEN BUT I HAVE IT ALL PRETTY WELL THOUGHT OUT I'VE HAD SUCH A TIME TO GET A SUITABLE PLOT
THERE'S ONE PLACE WHERE THAT DALRYMPLE CHAP TALKS EVEN ON FOR TWO PAGES AND NEVER LETS THE GIRL GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE IF HE'D DONE THAT IN REAL LIFE SHE'D HAVE PITCHED HIM I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID ANNE FLATLY
MISSUS LYNDE MIGHT BE BOSSY BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS A BOX OF COOKIES IN HER KITCHEN CUPBOARD AND SHE WAS NOT STINGY AT THIS INCONVENIENT MOMENT DAVY REMEMBERED THAT WHEN HE HAD TORN HIS NEW SCHOOL PANTS THE WEEK BEFORE
HE GLIBLY RECITED AN OLD GOLDEN TEXT LEARNED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO FORTUNATELY MISSUS LYNDE NOW STOPPED QUESTIONING HIM BUT DAVY DID NOT ENJOY HIS DINNER
IN THE PEWS MORE THAN ONE FAMILIAR FACE WAS MISSING FOREVER OLD UNCLE ABE HIS PROPHESYING OVER AND DONE WITH MISSUS PETER SLOANE WHO HAD SIGHED IT WAS TO BE HOPED FOR THE LAST TIME TIMOTHY COTTON
THEY SPENT A SPLENDID HALF HOUR CLIMBING ON THE ROOF AND DIVING OFF INTO THE STRAW WITH WHOOPS AND YELLS BUT EVEN UNLAWFUL PLEASURES MUST COME TO AN END WHEN THE RUMBLE OF WHEELS OVER THE POND BRIDGE TOLD THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING HOME FROM CHURCH
AVONLEA HAD NOT CHANGED EITHER AT LEAST SO IT SEEMED AT FIRST BUT AS ANNE SAT IN THE GREEN GABLES PEW
DIANA PRUDENTLY REFRAINED FROM ANY FURTHER CRITICISM BUT MISTER HARRISON WAS MUCH HARDER TO PLEASE FIRST HE TOLD HER THERE WAS ENTIRELY TOO MUCH DESCRIPTION IN THE STORY CUT OUT ALL THOSE FLOWERY PASSAGES HE SAID UNFEELINGLY
SHE WILL DO AND SAY THINGS I NEVER MEANT HER TO THEN THAT SPOILS EVERYTHING THAT WENT BEFORE AND I HAVE TO WRITE IT ALL OVER AGAIN FINALLY HOWEVER THE STORY WAS FINISHED AND ANNE READ IT TO DIANA IN THE SECLUSION OF THE PORCH GABLE
BUT HE KNEW ANYWAY DAVY THAT'S WHAT DORA SAID
OF COURSE IT WILL BE ACCEPTED AND THEY WILL LIKELY ASK YOU TO SEND THEM MORE YOU MAY BE AS FAMOUS AS MISSUS MORGAN SOME DAY ANNE AND THEN HOW PROUD I'LL BE OF KNOWING YOU SAID DIANA WHO POSSESSED AT LEAST THE STRIKING MERIT
THEN POOR DAVY BETOOK HIMSELF TO A SECLUDED RETREAT BEHIND THE WOODPILE TO THINK OVER THE WAY OF TRANSGRESSORS GREEN GABLES WAS WRAPPED IN DARKNESS AND SILENCE WHEN ANNE REACHED HOME SHE LOST NO TIME GOING TO BED FOR SHE WAS VERY TIRED AND SLEEPY
THAT CONGESTION LAST WINTER PULLED ME DOWN A LITTLE BUT JUST SEE MY COLOR I DON'T LOOK MUCH LIKE AN INVALID I'M SURE RUBY'S VOICE WAS ALMOST SHARP
THAT ONE SIN DEMANDS ANOTHER TO COVER IT THEY HAD DINNER WITH MISSUS LYNDE THAT DAY AND THE FIRST THING SHE ASKED DAVY WAS WERE ALL YOUR CLASS IN SUNDAY SCHOOL TODAY YES'M
ANNE TOOK THIS SECOND REJECTION WITH THE CALMNESS OF DESPAIR SHE LOCKED THE STORY AWAY IN THE GARRET TRUNK WHERE THE OLD STORY CLUB TALES REPOSED
I'D RATHER TELL YOU FIRST WHAT IS IT YOU DID
BUT ONE DID NOT HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH DORA OF COURSE NOT HE ADMITTED SULKILY TOMCAT ISN'T A HOLY WORD I WOULDN'T MENTION SUCH AN ANIMAL BEFORE A MINISTER AT ALL BUT IF YOU HAD TO PERSISTED DORA
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT EXCEPT HERSELF AND HER FAMILY
EXPLAINED DIANA OH ANYTHING DOES FOR AN EXCUSE OF COURSE SAID AUNT ATOSSA AMIABLY
HE DID BAD THINGS BUT HE DID THEM PERCEVAL HADN'T TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT MOONING MOONING THAT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN PITCHING MAURICE LENNOX WAS THE VILLAIN SAID ANNE INDIGNANTLY I DON'T SEE WHY EVERY ONE LIKES HIM BETTER THAN PERCEVAL
WAS HONESTLY ALARMED LEST HE SHOULD NEVER IN THE WORLD BE ABLE TO GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT AGAIN DARN HER EXPLODED DAVY OH DAVY DON'T SWEAR GASPED DORA IN DISMAY
IN IMAGINATION ANNE SAW HERSELF READING A STORY OUT OF A MAGAZINE TO MARILLA ENTRAPPING HER INTO PRAISE OF IT FOR IN IMAGINATION ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE AND THEN TRIUMPHANTLY ANNOUNCING HERSELF THE AUTHOR ONE DAY
DAVY IS THAT YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER A WHITE CLAD FIGURE FLUNG ITSELF ACROSS THE FLOOR
IT'S COLLEGE AIRS I S'POSE YOU'D BE WISER TO KEEP AWAY FROM RUBY GILLIS THE DOCTORS SAY CONSUMPTION'S CATCHING I ALWAYS KNEW RUBY'D GET SOMETHING GADDING OFF TO BOSTON LAST FALL FOR A VISIT PEOPLE WHO AIN'T CONTENT TO STAY HOME ALWAYS CATCH SOMETHING
SHE WAS EVEN HANDSOMER THAN EVER BUT HER BLUE EYES WERE TOO BRIGHT AND LUSTROUS AND THE COLOR OF HER CHEEKS WAS HECTICALLY BRILLIANT BESIDES SHE WAS VERY THIN THE HANDS THAT HELD HER HYMN BOOK WERE ALMOST TRANSPARENT IN THEIR DELICACY
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO END IT HAPPILY OR UNHAPPILY I'M NOT SURE
BUT AT LEAST SHE WORE DRESSES WE'VE COME
SHE SAT PRIMLY ON A HENCOOP IN THE YARD WHILE THE OTHERS PLAYED AN UPROARIOUS GAME OF TAG AND THEN THEY ALL CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE PIG HOUSE ROOF AND CUT THEIR INITIALS ON THE SADDLEBOARD
RETORTED DAVY RECKLESSLY WELL IF YOU MUST SAY DREADFUL WORDS DON'T SAY THEM ON SUNDAY PLEADED DORA DAVY WAS AS YET FAR FROM REPENTANCE BUT IN HIS SECRET SOUL HE FELT THAT PERHAPS HE HAD GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR
WELL ANYWAY IT'S A PERFECTLY ELEGANT STORY ANNE AND WILL MAKE YOU FAMOUS OF THAT I'M SURE HAVE YOU GOT A TITLE FOR IT
DAVY WAS STILL BOILING OVER THIS AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF THE LANE DAVY STOPPED AND TWISTED HIS COUNTENANCE INTO SUCH AN UNEARTHLY AND TERRIFIC CONTORTION THAT DORA ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW HIS GIFTS IN THAT RESPECT

RUBY SLIPPED HER ARM ABOUT ANNE'S WAIST WITH A SHALLOW LITTLE LAUGH BUT JUST FOR A MOMENT THEIR EYES MET AND BEHIND ALL THE LUSTER OF RUBY'S ANNE SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE HER HEART ACHE COME UP OFTEN WON'T YOU ANNE WHISPERED RUBY
CHAPTER TWELVE AVERIL'S ATONEMENT WHAT ARE YOU DREAMING OF ANNE THE TWO GIRLS WERE LOITERING ONE EVENING IN A FAIRY HOLLOW OF THE BROOK FERNS NODDED IN IT
AND BY INVADING THE PALATINATE INSTEAD OF THE REPUBLIC FOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN DOING HIS UTMOST TO WIN OVER TO HIS SIDE BY THE AGENCY OF WALDECK AND BENTINCK THE PROTESTANT PRINCES OF GERMANY WITH THE RESULT THAT BRANDENBURG HANOVER SAXONY
THE PRETEXT ASSIGNED WAS THE NECESSITY OF PROTECTING THE EASTERN FRONTIER OF THE REPUBLIC AGAINST AN ATTACK FROM COLOGNE WHERE CARDINAL FUERSTENBERG
THE COLONEL WAS TRIED ON THE CHARGE OF DESERTING HIS POST AND SHOT
BY THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF ORANGE
ENDEAVOURED TO DETACH THE REPUBLIC BY OFFERING TO MAKE A SEPARATE PEACE ON GENEROUS TERMS
MARY'S CHARACTER AS IT IS REVEALED IN HER PRIVATE DIARIES WHICH HAVE BEEN PRESERVED DESERVES THOSE EPITHETS PROFOUNDLY RELIGIOUS AND A CONVINCED PROTESTANT MARY WITH PRAYERS FOR GUIDANCE AND NOT WITHOUT MANY TEARS FELT
WILLIAM WATCHED KEENLY ALL THAT WAS GOING ON AND KEPT HIMSELF IN CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE WITH SEVERAL OF THE PRINCIPAL MALCONTENTS HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT ALL EYES WERE TURNING TO HIM AND HE ACCEPTED THE POSITION AS THE NATURAL DEFENDER SHOULD THE NEED ARISE
UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIS OWN COUNTRY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE HE OFTEN SUBORDINATED ITS PARTICULAR INTERESTS TO THE WIDER EUROPEAN INTERESTS WHICH OCCUPIED HIS ATTENTION THE WORK OF BUILDING UP AFRESH A COALITION TO WITHSTAND THE EVER GROWING MENACE OF THE FORMIDABLE FRENCH POWER
AND ESPECIALLY IN AMSTERDAM PROSPERITY WAS JUST BEGINNING TO REVIVE AND A REMEMBRANCE OF PAST EXPERIENCES FILLED THE HEARTS OF MANY WITH DREAD AT THE THOUGHT OF THE FRENCH ARMIES ONCE MORE INVADING THEIR LAND
BY HAVING TO PLACE GARRISONS IN THE CONQUERED PROVINCES AND NEITHER TURENNE NOR LUXEMBURG FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO ATTACK THE STRONGLY PROTECTED DUTCH FRONTIERS BEHIND THE WATER LINE THE PRINCE HOWEVER WAS NOT CONTENT WITH INACTION
INCLINED TO FOLLOW HIS FATHER'S EXAMPLE AND CRUSH THE OPPOSITION OF AMSTERDAM BY FORCE
HE HAD WALDECK AT HIS SIDE NOT MERELY AS A MILITARY ADVISER BUT AS A SKILFUL DIPLOMATIST WELL VERSED IN THE INTRICATE POLITICS OF THE SMALLER GERMAN STATES
WHILE THOSE PARTS OF HOLLAND AND ZEELAND ON WHICH THE ENEMY HAD NOT SET FOOT HAD BEEN CRUSHED BENEATH HEAVY TAXES AND THE LOSS OF COMMERCE THE POSITION OF THE THREE PROVINCES UTRECHT GELDERLAND AND OVERYSSEL WHICH HAD BEEN OVERRUN BY THE FRENCH AT THE OPENING OF HOSTILITIES AND HELD BY THEM EVER SINCE
THE ELECTOR OF BRANDENBURG AS HEAD OF THE PRINCIPAL PROTESTANT STATE IN GERMANY HAD ALSO OFFERED AN ASYLUM TO THE FRENCH EXILES AND NOW REVERTED ONCE MORE TO HIS NATURAL ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES HE SENT HIS TRUSTED COUNCILLOR
THE YOUNG GIRL WEPT BITTERLY AT HAVING TO LEAVE HER HOME FOR A STRANGE LAND AT THE SIDE OF A COLD UNSYMPATHETIC HUSBAND THE WEEKS HE SPENT IN ENGLAND HAD BEEN UTILISED BY THE PRINCE TO GOOD PURPOSE
THE NOMINATION OR THE CHOICE OUT OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF NOMINEES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE TOWN CORPORATIONS OF THE COURTS OF JUSTICE AND OF THE DELEGATES TO THE STATES GENERAL WAS GRANTED TO HIM THE DUTCH REPUBLIC WAS FULL OF ANOMALIES
PROVED WORTHY SUCCESSORS OF VAN BEVERNINGH AND VAN BEUNINGEN
IT NO SOONER MET THAN IT SHOWED ITS STRONG SYMPATHY WITH THE NETHERLANDS AND THE KING SPEEDILY SAW THAT HE COULD NO LONGER PURSUE A POLICY OPPOSED TO THE WISHES OF HIS PEOPLE WHEN THEREFORE WILLIAM SENT OVER HIS MOST TRUSTED FRIEND AND COUNSELLOR BENTINCK
PAUL FUCHS IN MAY SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO OFFER TO HIS NEPHEW THE PRINCE OF ORANGE HIS FRIENDLY CO OPERATION IN THE FORMATION OF A POWERFUL COALITION AGAINST FRANCE FUCHS WAS A SKILLED DIPLOMATIST
AFTER SOME HESITATION WILLIAM WITH THE CONSENT AND APPROVAL OF THE PRINCESS DECIDED TO ACCEPT IT NO MAN EVER HAD A MORE LOYAL AND DEVOTED WIFE THAN WILLIAM THE THIRD OF ORANGE AND HE DID NOT DESERVE IT FOR SOME YEARS AFTER HIS MARRIAGE HE TREATED MARY WITH COLDNESS AND NEGLECT
HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT THERE WAS IN ENGLAND A VERY STRONG AND WIDESPREAD OPPOSITION TO THE SUCCESSION OF JAMES DUKE OF YORK WHO MADE NO SECRET OF HIS DEVOTED ATTACHMENT TO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC FAITH SO STRONG WAS THE FEELING THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO RESIGN HIS POST OF LORD HIGH ADMIRAL
THE TREATY WAS SIGNED ON SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH SIXTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE PEACE OF NIJMWEGEN THUS BROUGHT HOSTILITIES TO AN END LEAVING THE UNITED PROVINCES IN POSSESSION OF ALL THEIR TERRITORY IT LASTED TEN YEARS BUT IT WAS ONLY AN ARMED TRUCE
TO THESE WERE NOW ADDED THE EMPEROR AND THE POPE WHO BEING ACTUALLY AT WAR WITH FRANCE WERE READY TO LOOK FAVOURABLY UPON AN EXPEDITION WHICH WOULD WEAKEN THE COMMON ENEMY
AUGUST FIFTEENTH SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH LEFT THE FRENCH KING IN POSSESSION OF ALL HIS CONQUESTS NO MORE CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF THE INFLEXIBLE RESOLVE OF WILLIAM THE THIRD CAN BE FOUND THAN THE PATIENCE HE NOW EXHIBITED HIS FAITH IN HIMSELF WAS NEVER SHAKEN
AND A RAPID MARCH WAS MADE TO EXETER
THE NAVAL POWER AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF ENGLAND WERE NEEDED TO ENABLE THE COALITION
THE AMSTERDAM REGENTS EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO ENTER INTO SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH D'AVAUX AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY HENRY CASIMIR WHO WAS ALWAYS READY TO THWART HIS COUSIN'S POLICY WILLIAM WAS CHECKMATED AND AT FIRST IN HIS ANGER
ACCESSION AFTER HAVING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS PERSECUTED THE HUGUENOTS IN DEFIANCE OF THE EDICT OF NANTES TAKEN THE STEP OF REVOKING THAT GREAT INSTRUMENT OF RELIGIOUS TOLERATION ON NOVEMBER SEVENTEENTH SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE
ASSUMING THE OFFENSIVE HE VENTURED ON A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON NAARDEN AND ON WOERDEN RAISED THE SIEGE OF MAESTRICHT AND FINALLY MADE AN ATTEMPT TO CUT THE FRENCH COMMUNICATIONS BY A MARCH UPON CHARLEROI ALL THESE RAIDS
NEVER DID DE RUYTER EXHIBIT HIGHER QUALITIES OF LEADERSHIP THAN IN THE NAVAL CAMPAIGN OF SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE HIS FLEET WAS GREATLY INFERIOR IN NUMBERS TO THE COMBINED ANGLO FRENCH FLEET UNDER PRINCE RUPERT AND D'ESTREES
SPEEDILY AGREED TO CONCLUDE PEACE ON THE FOLLOWING TERMS THE FRENCH TO RESTORE MAESTRICHT AND TO EVACUATE ALL OCCUPIED DUTCH TERRITORY AND TO MAKE A COMMERCIAL TREATY SPAIN TO SURRENDER AN IMPORTANT SLICE OF SOUTHERN FLANDERS
HAD THE PRINCE AT THIS MOMENT SET HIS HEART UPON OBTAINING THE TITLE OF SOVEREIGN HE WOULD HAVE HAD BUT LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN GRATIFYING HIS AMBITION
ALREADY IN JULY VIGOROUS PREPARATIONS IN ALL SECRECY BEGAN TO BE MADE FOR THE EXPEDITION THE NAVAL YARDS WERE WORKING AT FULL PRESSURE WITH THE OSTENSIBLE OBJECT OF SENDING OUT A FLEET TO SUPPRESS PIRACY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
AND DENMARK THE CAMPAIGN OF THE SUMMER OF SIXTEEN SEVENTY FOUR THUS OPENED UNDER FAVOURING CIRCUMSTANCES BUT NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE OCCURRED UNTIL AUGUST ELEVENTH
WILLIAM THUS FOUND HIMSELF BEFORE THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE CAME TO AN END ABLE TO PURSUE HIS POLICY WITHOUT SERIOUS LET OR HINDRANCE HE WAS QUITE READY TO SEIZE HIS OPPORTUNITY
WHERE THE ANTI ORANGE PARTY WAS MOST STRONGLY REPRESENTED THE PRINCE HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING ON OCTOBER EIGHTH THE UNANIMOUS APPROVAL OF THE STATES GENERAL ASSEMBLED IN SECRET SESSION TO THE PROPOSED EXPEDITION
AND NORTH BRABANT AND IN THE MEANTIME THE STADHOLDER WAS WEEK BY WEEK STRENGTHENING THE WEAK POINTS IN HIS DEFENCES ENCOURAGING HIS MEN PERSONALLY SUPERVISING EVERY DETAIL AND SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF UNSHAKEN COURAGE AND OF CEASELESS INDUSTRY
HE WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH OTHER THINGS AND THE AGE OF MARY SHE WAS ONLY TWELVE RENDERED IT EASY FOR HIM TO POSTPONE HIS FINAL DECISION EVENTS WERE TO FORCE HIS HAND IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SIX THE FRENCH KING FEARING THE POWER OF THE COALITION THAT WAS GROWING IN STRENGTH
A VISIT MADE BY WILLIAM TO LONDON CONVINCED HIM THAT NOTHING WAS AT PRESENT TO BE HOPED FOR FROM THAT QUARTER AT THE SAME TIME THE VERY ABLE FRENCH AMBASSADOR AT THE HAGUE D'AVAUX DID HIS UTMOST TO FOMENT THE DIVISIONS AND FACTIONS IN THE PROVINCES
BUT TO BE LEFT IN POSSESSION OF A BELT OF FORTRESSES TO COVER THEIR NETHERLAND POSSESSIONS AGAINST FURTHER FRENCH ATTACK
ALARM AT THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE FRENCH POWER BROUGHT AT LAST BOTH SPANISH AND AUSTRIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE HARD PRESSED NETHERLANDS AND THE COURAGE AND SKILL OF DE RUYTER HELD SUCCESSFULLY AT BAY THE UNITED FLEETS OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE AND EFFECTUALLY PREVENTED THE LANDING OF AN ARMY ON THE DUTCH COAST
MOST OF THEM ALWAYS READY TO HIRE OUT THEIR ARMED FORCES FOR A SUBSIDY SWEDEN ALSO OFFERED ASSISTANCE BUT BOTH ENGLAND AND BRANDENBURG WERE IN SECRET COLLUSION WITH FRANCE AND THE EMPEROR WOULD NOT MOVE OWING TO THE TURKISH MENACE
PRO RELIGIONE ET LIBERTATE INSCRIBED ABOVE THE MOTTO OF THE HOUSE OF ORANGE
ALL ATTEMPTS HOWEVER TO PASS THE WATER LINE AND ENTER HOLLAND MET WITH FAILURE AND AS THE SUMMER DREW TO ITS CLOSE THE ADVANCE OF IMPERIAL AND SPANISH FORCES BEGAN TO RENDER THE POSITION OF THE FRENCH PRECARIOUS
VERY RARELY COULD A BORN LEADER OF MEN HAVE BEEN MORE UNAMIABLE OR LESS ANXIOUS TO WIN POPULAR APPLAUSE BUT HIS WHOLE DEMEANOUR INSPIRED CONFIDENCE AND IGNORING THE MANY DIFFICULTIES AND OPPOSITIONS WHICH THWARTED HIM
COULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN MORE UNPROMISING THAN IT NOW APPEARED SPAIN WAS UTTERLY EXHAUSTED AND FEEBLE
SPEEDILY FOLLOWED ON JUNE TENTH BY THE BIRTH OF A PRINCE OF WALES THE REPORT WAS SPREAD THAT THE CHILD WAS SUPPOSITITIOUS AND IT WAS ACCEPTED AS TRUE BY LARGE NUMBERS OF PERSONS INCLUDING THE PRINCESS ANNE AND ALSO ON THE STRENGTH OF HER TESTIMONY
THE EXILE OF NUMEROUS FAMILIES WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN DRIVEN OUT BY THE DRAGONNADES WAS NOW FOLLOWED BY THE EXPULSION OF THE ENTIRE HUGUENOT BODY OF ALL AT LEAST WHO REFUSED TO CONFORM TO THE CATHOLIC FAITH
WILLIAM ACCORDINGLY ARRIVED IN LONDON ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH AND THE ASSENT OF THE KING AND THE DUKE OF YORK BEING OBTAINED THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH ALMOST INDECENT HASTE IT WAS A PURELY POLITICAL UNION AND WHEN EARLY IN DECEMBER THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF ORANGE SET SAIL FOR HOLLAND
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES EVERYTHING WAS FAVOURABLE TO AN UNDERSTANDING AND PEACE WAS CONCLUDED AT WESTMINSTER ON FEBRUARY NINETEENTH SIXTEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE TERMS DIFFERED LITTLE FROM THOSE OF BREDA EXCEPT THAT THE REPUBLIC
OF ENGLAND'S CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES THE NEED AROSE AND THE CALL CAME IN THE SUMMER OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND IT FOUND WILLIAM PREPARED
HAD THE EFFECT OF INFLUENCING PUBLIC OPINION POWERFULLY IN THE STATES IN FAVOUR OF THEIR STADHOLDER'S WARLIKE POLICY
THE PEACE PARTY INCLUDED SUCH TRIED AND TRUSTED STATESMEN AS VAN BEVERNINGH VAN BEUNINGEN AND THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY FAGEL ALL OF THEM LOYAL COUNSELLORS OF THE STADHOLDER SO RESOLUTE WAS THE ATTITUDE OF AMSTERDAM THAT THE LEADERS OF BOTH MUNICIPAL PARTIES
HE ALWAYS INSISTED THAT HE WAS ACCREDITED TO THE STATES GENERAL
THE STATES AND THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT WERE BOTH ANXIOUS TO AVOID THIS AND THE PRINCE OF ORANGE WHO STEADILY OPPOSED THE TREATY RETURNED TOWARDS THE END OF JULY TO HIS CAMP TO WATCH THE SIEGE OF MONS AND PREVENT ITS FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY
CHARLES HIMSELF HAD A STRONG AFFECTION FOR HIS NEPHEW AND BEGAN TO TURN A FAVOURABLE EAR TO HIS PROPOSALS FOR NEGOTIATIONS MORE ESPECIALLY AS HIS HEROIC EFFORTS TO STEM THE TIDE OF FRENCH INVASION HAD MET WITH SO MUCH SUCCESS
ADMIRAL HERBERT WAS IN COMMAND OF THE NAVAL FORCE WHICH CONVOYED SAFELY THROUGH THE CHANNEL WITHOUT OPPOSITION THE LONG LINES OF TRANSPORTS OVER THE PRINCE'S VESSEL FLOATED HIS FLAG WITH THE WORDS
HIS TALENTS FOR COMMAND ALWAYS SHOWED THEMSELVES MOST CONSPICUOUSLY IN ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES HIS COOLNESS AND COURAGE IN MOMENTS OF PERIL AND DIFFICULTY NEVER DESERTED HIM AND THOUGH A STRICT DISCIPLINARIAN HE ALWAYS RETAINED THE CONFIDENCE AND AFFECTION OF HIS SOLDIERS
AND FEW COULD EVEN GUESS AT THE HIDDEN WORKINGS OF THAT SCHEMING MIND OR AT THE BURNING FIRES OF ENERGY AND WILL POWER BENEATH THE PROUD AND FRIGID RESERVE OF A MAN SO FRAIL IN BODY AND ALWAYS AILING
HAD TURENNE AND LUXEMBURG MADE A UNITED EFFORT TO FORCE THIS LINE AT THE OPENING OF THE CAMPAIGN THE PROBABILITY IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED INSTEAD OF DOING SO THEY EXPENDED THEIR ENERGIES IN THE CAPTURE OF A NUMBER OF FORTIFIED PLACES IN GELDERLAND OVERYSSEL
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MAN IN AMSTERDAM WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED HIM
HAD TO BE RE SETTLED THEY HAD DURING THIS PERIOD PAID NO TAXES AND HAD NO REPRESENTATION IN THE STATES GENERAL HOLLAND WAS IN FAVOUR OF REDUCING THEM TO THE STATUS OF GENERALITY LANDS UNTIL THEY HAD PAID THEIR ARREARS
BUT THOUGH TENTATIVE EFFORTS WERE MADE BY THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT TO SET ON FOOT NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE AND A GROWING PARTY IN HOLLAND WERE BEGINNING TO CLAMOUR FOR THE CESSATION OF A WAR WHICH WAS CRIPPLING THEIR TRADE AND DRAINING THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY
ON AUGUST TENTH JUST BEFORE TIME FOR RESUMING HOSTILITIES HAD BEEN REACHED THEY TACTFULLY CONCEDED THIS POINT AND PROMISED IMMEDIATE EVACUATION IF THE TREATY WERE AT ONCE CONCLUDED VAN BEVERNINGH AND HIS COLLEAGUES ACCORDINGLY ACTING ON THEIR INSTRUCTIONS
THE FIRST STEP WAS TO CONCLUDE PEACE THIS WAS NOT A DIFFICULT TASK THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND STILL MORE THE ENGLISH PEOPLE HAD THROUGHOUT BEEN AVERSE FROM FIGHTING ON THE SIDE OF THE FRENCH AGAINST THE DUTCH
HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO PROMISE HIS SUPPORT BY LAND AND SEA TO THE NETHERLANDS IN CASE THE TERMS OF PEACE OFFERED BY THE ALLIES WERE REJECTED BY THE FRENCH A TREATY BETWEEN THE STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN GIVING EFFECT TO THIS PROMISE WAS ACTUALLY SIGNED ON JANUARY TWENTY NINTH SIXTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
THE STADHOLDER BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR ENTIRELY FREED THE COUNTRY FROM ITS INVADERS ONCE MORE A PRINCE OF ORANGE HAD SAVED THE DUTCH REPUBLIC IN ITS EXTREMITY THE EFFECT OF THIS WAS TO PLACE ALMOST SUPREME POWER IN HIS HANDS
ORANGE AT ONCE REFERRED THE MATTER TO THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND HIMSELF PROPOSED THAT SIXTEEN THOUSAND SHOULD BE SENT AS THIS HOWEVER COULD ONLY MEAN A RENEWAL OF THE WAR WITH FRANCE THE PROPOSAL MET WITH STRONG OPPOSITION IN MANY QUARTERS
THE STADHOLDER FELT THAT HE WAS ABLE TO RELY UPON THE WILLING CO OPERATION OF THE STATES IN HIS PROJECT HIS DIFFICULTY NOW AS ALWAYS WAS TO SECURE THE ASSENT OF AMSTERDAM BUT THE OPPOSITION OF THAT CITY PROVED LESS FORMIDABLE THAN WAS ANTICIPATED
THE FRENCH RAISED VARIOUS PRETEXTS TO DELAY THE SIGNATURE OF THE TREATY HOPING THAT MEANWHILE MONS WHICH WAS CLOSELY BELEAGUERED BY LUXEMBURG MIGHT FALL INTO THEIR HANDS AND THUS BECOME AN ASSET WHICH THEY COULD EXCHANGE FOR SOME OTHER POSSESSION
WITH A GRANT OF ONE THIRTY THIRD OF ITS DIVIDENDS
AT THE SAME TIME JULY TWENTY SIXTH KING CHARLES WHO HAD BEEN WORKING THROUGH SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE FOR THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE NOW DECLARED THAT UNLESS THE TREATY WAS SIGNED BEFORE AUGUST ELEVENTH HE WOULD ASSIST THE ALLIES TO ENFORCE IT
AFFIXED THEIR SIGNATURES JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT THEY FELL INTO THE TRAP LAID FOR THEM FOR THE TREATY BETWEEN FRANCE AND SPAIN WAS NOT YET SIGNED AND IT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE FRENCH TO MAKE FURTHER PRETEXTS FOR DELAY IN THE HOPE THAT MONS MEANWHILE WOULD FALL
THEY HELD THAT IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE REPUBLIC TO ATTEND TO ITS OWN AFFAIRS AND TO LEAVE LOUIS TO PURSUE HIS AGGRESSIVE POLICY AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES SO LONG AS HE LEFT THEM ALONE THE IDEAL WHICH WILLIAM THE THIRD HAD SET BEFORE HIM WAS THE EXACT REVERSE OF THIS AND
THE PRINCE WAS RESOLUTELY OPPOSED TO THE ENGLISH OFFER OF MEDIATION WHICH HE REGARDED AS INSINCERE AND PREMATURE
AND CARRIED ON CORRESPONDENCE AND INTRIGUES WITH THE PARTY IN AMSTERDAM OPPOSED TO THE STADHOLDER'S ANTI FRENCH POLICY THE CUMBROUS AND COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT ENABLED HIM THUS TO DO MUCH TO THWART THE PRINCE AND TO THROW OBSTACLES IN HIS WAY
AND HIS PATIENCE IN AWAITING THE FAVOURABLE MOMENT WAS INEXHAUSTIBLE TO HIM FAR MORE APPROPRIATELY THAN TO HIS GREAT GRANDFATHER MIGHT THE NAME OF WILLIAM THE SILENT HAVE BEEN GIVEN HE HAD NO CONFIDANTS EXCEPT WALDECK AND WILLIAM BENTINCK
THE SUPPORT OF A MAJORITY IN THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND HE USED THIS WITH EFFECT
THE GRAND ALLIANCE OF WILLIAM'S DREAMS HAD THUS SHOULD HIS EXPEDITION TO ENGLAND PROVE SUCCESSFUL COME WITHIN THE RANGE OF PRACTICAL POLITICS AND WITH HIS BASE SECURED ORANGE NOW DETERMINED TO DELAY NO LONGER BUT TO STAKE EVERYTHING UPON THE ISSUE OF THE ENGLISH VENTURE
BUT WAS A CRUSADE AGAINST PROTESTANTISM THE GOVERNING CLASSES IN HOLLAND ZEELAND FRIESLAND AND GRONINGEN
THE FORCE ALSO COMPRISED THE PRINCE'S DUTCH GUARDS AND OTHER PICKED DUTCH TROOPS AND ALSO SOME GERMAN LEVIES
SEVERAL ENGLISHMEN OF NOTE SIGNED AN INVITATION TO THE PRINCE TO LAND IN ENGLAND WITH AN ARMED FORCE IN DEFENCE OF THE RELIGION AND LIBERTIES OF THE COUNTRY AND IT WAS BROUGHT TO HIM BY ADMIRAL RUSSELL ONE OF THE SIGNATORIES
THAT THE RESOLVE OF HER HUSBAND TO HAZARD ALL ON ARMED INTERVENTION IN ENGLAND WAS FULLY JUSTIFIED AND AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE SHE HAD NO HESITATION IN ALLOWING HER SENSE OF DUTY TO HER HUSBAND AND HER COUNTRY TO OVERRIDE THAT OF A DAUGHTER TO HER FATHER
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SPAIN WAS COMPELLED SIXTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY THE ENTRY OF THE ARMIES OF LOUIS INTO THE SOUTHERN NETHERLANDS TO DECLARE WAR UPON FRANCE AND CALLED UPON THE STATES FOR THEIR MILITARY AID OF EIGHT THOUSAND MEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE TREATY OF NIJMWEGEN
WRONG HEADED AND FANATICAL AND FROM THE FIRST HE AIMED AT THE IMPOSSIBLE HIS ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH ABSOLUTE RULE TO BRING BACK THE ENGLISH NATION TO THE FOLD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND AS A MEANS TO THAT END
WITHDREW FROM THE DUTCH FRONTIER AND AT THE SAME TIME THE MUENSTER COLOGNE FORCES HASTILY EVACUATED THE EASTERN PROVINCES
WILLIAM DESPITE THE ARRIVAL OF AN ENGLISH AUXILIARY FORCE UNDER MONMOUTH COULD DO LITTLE TO CHECK THE ENEMY'S SUPERIOR FORCES MEANWHILE FRENCH DIPLOMACY WAS BUSY AT AMSTERDAM AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STATES WORKING AGAINST THE WAR PARTIES
THE FRENCH DIPLOMATISTS AT NIJMWEGEN HAD HITHERTO DECLARED THAT THEIR TROOPS WOULD NOT EVACUATE MAESTRICHT AND THE OTHER PLACES WHICH THEY HAD AGREED TO RESTORE TO THE STATES UNTIL BRANDENBURG AND DENMARK HAD EVACUATED THE TERRITORY THEY HAD CONQUERED FROM SWEDEN
IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HOWEVER THE CAPTURE OF VALENCIENNES
WAS NOT SLOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
AND WITH COLOGNE MAY ELEVENTH ON THE BASIS OF THE EVACUATION OF ALL CONQUERED TERRITORY FRANCE WAS ISOLATED AND OPPOSED NOW BY A STRONG COALITION THE REPUBLIC HAVING SECURED THE HELP OF AUSTRIA SPAIN BRANDENBURG
BY THE IMPERIALIST CONTINGENTS HAD TO RETIRE FROM THE FIELD HE WAS NEVER A GREAT STRATEGIST BUT HE NOW CONDUCTED A RETREAT WHICH EXTRACTED ADMIRATION FROM HIS OPPONENTS
BY THAT TIME AN ARMY OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEN HAD BEEN GATHERED TOGETHER AND WAS ENCAMPED AT MOOK OF THESE THE SIX ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH REGIMENTS WHO NOW AS THROUGHOUT THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE WERE MAINTAINED IN THE DUTCH SERVICE FORMED THE NUCLEUS
A HARD FROST IN DECEMBER ENABLED LUXEMBURG TO PENETRATE INTO HOLLAND BUT A RAPID THAW COMPELLED A HASTY WITHDRAWAL THE ONLY ROAD OPEN TO HIM WAS BLOCKED BY A FORTIFIED POST AT NIEUWERBRUG
TO MAKE HIMSELF INDEPENDENT OF PARLIAMENT BY ACCEPTING SUBSIDIES FROM THE FRENCH KING WERE BOUND TO END IN CATASTROPHE
GELDERLAND AND OVERYSSEL WHILE THE STATES GENERAL IN THEIR TURN MADE THE CAPTAIN AND ADMIRAL GENERALSHIP OF THE UNION HEREDITARY OFFICES NOR WAS GRATITUDE CONFINED TO THE CONFERRING OF POWERS AND DIGNITIES WHICH GAVE THE PRINCE IN ALL BUT NAME MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY
IN HAINAULT THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT OUT WITH GREAT OBSTINACY AND THERE WERE HEAVY LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES THE FRENCH HOWEVER THOUGH INFERIOR IN NUMBERS HAD THE ADVANTAGE IN BEING A MORE COMPACT FORCE THAN THAT OF THE ALLIES AND WILLIAM POORLY SUPPORTED
SO LONG AS ENGLAND AND BRANDENBURG WERE ON FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH FRANCE TO PUT PRESSURE UPON THE STATES GENERAL THE FRENCH TROOPS TO THE PRINCE'S CHAGRIN OVERRAN FLANDERS AND HE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO CONCUR IN THE TRUCE FOR TWENTY YEARS CONCLUDED AT RATISBON
AND HE FELT THAT HONOUR COMPELLED HIM TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE
AND HIS TIRELESS OPPONENT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE HENCEFORTH MADE IT THE ONE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE TO FORM A GRAND ALLIANCE TO CURB FRENCH AMBITION AND UPHOLD IN EUROPE WHAT WAS HENCEFORTH KNOWN AS THE BALANCE OF POWER IN SETTING ABOUT THIS TASK WILLIAM WAS CONFRONTED WITH ALMOST INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES
AS HE LIKEWISE CONTROLLED THE ESTATES IN ZEELAND HE COULD ALWAYS COUNT UPON A MAJORITY VOTE IN THE STATES GENERAL IN SUPPORT OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY NOR WAS THIS ALL HOLLAND ITSELF IN GRATITUDE FOR ITS DELIVERANCE HAD BECOME ENTHUSIASTICALLY ORANGIST
THE PRINCE BADE FAREWELL TO THE STATES GENERAL ON OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH AND FOUR DAYS LATER HE SET SAIL FROM HELVOETSLUIS BUT WAS DRIVEN BACK BY A HEAVY STORM WHICH SEVERELY DAMAGED THE FLEET
LARGE TRACTS ON THE BORDERS OF HOLLAND UTRECHT AND FRIESLAND SUBMERGED BY THE SEA WATERS THROUGH THE CUTTING OF THE DAMS HAD BEEN RENDERED VALUELESS FOR SOME YEARS TO COME
AND THE REVOCATION OF THE EDICT OF NANTES WHICH WERE TO HAVE FAR REACHING CONSEQUENCES THE NEW KING OF ENGLAND WAS NOT MERELY A STRONG BUT A BIGOTED ROMAN CATHOLIC
AND TO HIM THE EYES OF A LARGE PARTY IN ENGLAND WERE TURNING
HE STEADFASTLY BIDED HIS TIME AND OPPORTUNITY IT NOW CAME QUICKLY FOR THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WAS MARKED BY TWO EVENTS
IMMERSED IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS HE LEFT THE INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE HANDS OF SUBORDINATES CHOSEN RATHER FOR THEIR SUBSERVIENCE THAN FOR THEIR ABILITY AND PROBITY
THE COMMERCIAL CLASSES HAD BEEN HARD HIT BY THE FRENCH INVASION AND THEY WERE NOW SUFFERING HEAVY LOSSES AT SEA THROUGH THE DUNKIRK PRIVATEERS LED BY THE DARING JEAN BART
BRUNSWICK AND HESSE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO GIVE HIM ACTIVE SUPPORT AGAINST A FRENCH ATTACK WHILE THE CONSTANT THREAT AGAINST HER POSSESSIONS IN THE BELGIC NETHERLANDS COMPELLED SPAIN TO JOIN THE ANTI FRENCH LEAGUE WHICH THE STADHOLDER HAD SO LONG BEEN STRIVING TO BRING INTO EXISTENCE
THE DISLIKE AND DISTRUST HE AROUSED HAD BEEN ACCENTUATED BY HIS SECOND MARRIAGE TO MARY OF MODENA A ZEALOUS CATHOLIC WILLIAM WAS THE SON OF THE ELDEST DAUGHTER
IT DECLARED THE STADHOLDERSHIP HEREDITARY IN THE MALE LINE AND ITS EXAMPLE WAS FOLLOWED BY ZEELAND UTRECHT
THE REPORT OF THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE REACHED THE STADHOLDER IN HIS CAMP ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH BUT UNOFFICIALLY
TO LONDON ON A SECRET MISSION IN THE SUMMER HE MET WITH A MOST FAVOURABLE RECEPTION
THE RESULTS HOWEVER DID NOT ANSWER WILLIAM'S EXPECTATIONS THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND THE STATES ALIKE HAD NO TRUST IN KING CHARLES NOR WAS THE ENGLISH MATCH AT FIRST POPULAR IN HOLLAND A STRONG OPPOSITION AROSE AGAINST THE PRINCE'S WAR POLICY
HAD BEEN ELECTED TO THE ARCHIEPISCOPAL THRONE MEANWHILE DIPLOMACY WAS ACTIVE
THE PRINCE WAS OPPOSED TO ANY HARSHNESS OF TREATMENT AND HIS WILL PREVAILED THE THREE PROVINCES WERE RE ADMITTED INTO THE UNION BUT WITH SHORN PRIVILEGES AND WILLIAM WAS ELECTED STADHOLDER BY EACH OF THEM WITH LARGELY INCREASED POWERS
IN THE HANDS OF THE FRENCH THE WAR ON LAND DRAGGED ON WITHOUT ANY DECISIVE RESULTS DURING SIXTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE STADHOLDER WAS BADLY SUPPORTED BY HIS ALLIES AND REDUCED TO THE DEFENSIVE
WILLIAM SEIZED HIS OPPORTUNITY IN SEPTEMBER TO CAPTURE NAARDEN BEFORE LUXEMBURG COULD ADVANCE TO ITS RELIEF HE THEN TOOK A BOLDER STEP IN OCTOBER AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEN OF WHOM FIFTEEN THOUSAND WERE SPANISH HE MARCHED TO COLOGNE AND
THE CURIOUS THING IS THAT WILLIAM WAS SO INTENT ON HIS LARGER PROJECTS THAT HE WAS CONTENT TO USE THE POWERS HE HAD WITHOUT MAKING ANY SERIOUS ATTEMPT AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO MAKE THE MACHINE OF GOVERNMENT MORE WORKABLE BY REFORMS IN THE DIRECTION OF CENTRALISATION
HE CONFESSED ON ONE OCCASION TO BISHOP BURNET THAT HIS CHURLISHNESS WAS PARTLY DUE TO JEALOUSY HE COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT THAT MARY MIGHT SUCCEED TO THE ENGLISH THRONE AND HE WOULD IN THAT COUNTRY BE INFERIOR IN RANK TO HIS WIFE
AND BY HIS MEDIATION AN UNDERSTANDING WAS ARRIVED AT BETWEEN THE STADHOLDER AND HIS OPPONENTS IN AMSTERDAM AT THE SAME TIME STRONG FAMILY INFLUENCE WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON HENRY CASIMIR OF FRIESLAND AND A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO STADHOLDERS WAS EFFECTED
HE HAD AT HIS SIDE AS HIS FIELD MARSHAL GEORGE FREDERICK COUNT OF WALDECK AN OFFICER OF EXPERIENCE AND SKILL WHO HAD ENTERED THE REPUBLIC'S SERVICE
THE DUTCH PEOPLE GENERALLY HAD SUFFERED TERRIBLY IN THE LATE INVASIONS AND WERE HEARTILY SICK OF WAR THE INTEREST OF THE HOLLANDERS AND ESPECIALLY OF THE AMSTERDAMMERS WAS ABSORBED IN THE PEACEFUL PURSUITS OF COMMERCE
AFTER EFFECTING A JUNCTION WITH THE IMPERIAL ARMY LAID SIEGE TO BONN WHICH SURRENDERED ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH THIS BRILLIANT STROKE HAD GREAT RESULTS THE FRENCH FEARING THAT THEIR COMMUNICATIONS MIGHT BE CUT
THE BISHOP INFORMED THE PRINCESS WHO AT ONCE WARMLY DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER ACCEPT THE CROWN UNLESS HER HUSBAND RECEIVED NOT MERELY THE TITLE OF KING BUT THE PREROGATIVES OF A REIGNING SOVEREIGN FROM THAT TIME FORWARD A COMPLETE RECONCILIATION TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THEM
AND SCARCELY LESS THE SECURITY OF THE COMMERCE ON WHICH AMSTERDAM DEPENDED FOR ITS PROSPERITY THE SUPPORT OF AMSTERDAM SECURED THAT OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND AND FINALLY AFTER THUS SURMOUNTING SUCCESSFULLY THE ELEMENTS OF OPPOSITION IN THE TOWN AND THE PROVINCE
A STUBBORN ACTION TOOK PLACE NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE SCHELDT ON JUNE SEVENTH IN WHICH THE ENGLISH HAD LITTLE ASSISTANCE FROM THE FRENCH SQUADRON AND FINALLY RETIRED TO THE ESTUARY OF THE THAMES
HE KEPT HIMSELF WELL INFORMED OF THE INTRIGUES OF THE COURT AND OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC OPINION BY SECRET AGENTS AND ENTERED INTO CLANDESTINE CORRESPONDENCE WITH PROMINENT STATESMEN
HE WAS ACCUSED OF WISHING TO CONTINUE THE WAR FROM MOTIVES OF PERSONAL AMBITION AND THE DESIRE OF MILITARY GLORY IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR HOWEVER
DESPITE THE STRONG OPPOSITION HE ENCOUNTERED AT AMSTERDAM AND SOME OTHER TOWNS WHERE THE INTERESTS OF COMMERCE REIGNED SUPREME
HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS LEFT THEIR HOMES TO FIND REFUGE IN FOREIGN LANDS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY BUT AMONGST THEM WERE GREAT NUMBERS OF INDUSTRIOUS AND SKILLED ARTISANS AND HANDICRAFTSMEN WHO SOUGHT ASYLUM IN THE DUTCH REPUBLIC AND THERE FOUND A READY AND SYMPATHETIC WELCOME
A SHORT DISTANCE FROM MONS WILLIAM EXPOSED HIS LIFE FREELY AND THOUGH THE RESULT WAS NOMINALLY A DRAWN BATTLE HE ACHIEVED HIS PURPOSE
AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN EVERYTHING INTO GOLD AND THEN SHE COULD HAVE A NEW WEDDING RING OF DIAMONDS ALL SET IN EMERALDS AND RUBIES AND TOPAZES AND ALL THE FURNITURE COULD BE TURNED INTO THE FINEST OF GOLD
WHEN THE MATTER WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM HE WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM
THE TURKEY SAID AGAMEMNON MUST BE JUST ABOVE THE KITCHEN DOOR IF I HAD A LADDER AND AN AXE I COULD CUT AWAY THE PLASTERING AND REACH IT THAT IS A GREAT IDEA SAID MISSUS PETERKIN IF YOU THINK YOU COULD DO IT SAID MISTER PETERKIN
THE SIGHT OF THIS PROCESSION ROUSED UP THE VILLAGE A TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION CRIED ALL THE BOYS OF THE TOWN AND THEY GATHERED ROUND THE HOUSE SHOUTING FOR THE FLAG
AND ELIZABETH ELIZA WHO PREFERRED FAT HAD A LEAN SLICE SOLOMON JOHN WHO COULD EAT NOTHING BUT LEAN WAS HELPED TO FAT AND SO ON NOBODY HAD WHAT HE COULD EAT

HE LISTENED AS CALMLY AS HE COULD TO THE STORY OF HOW MISSUS PETERKIN HAD PUT SALT IN HER COFFEE AT FIRST HE SAID HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT WHEN AGAMEMNON SAID THEY WOULD PAY IN GOLD IF HE WOULD ONLY GO
AND THE LITTLE BOYS CRIED OUT OH MAY WE GO TOO MISSUS PETERKIN SAID THAT ELIZABETH ELIZA AND THE LITTLE BOYS MIGHT GO SO MISTER PETERKIN HAD THE HORSE PUT INTO THE CARRYALL AND HE AND AGAMEMNON WENT OFF TO THEIR BUSINESS
AND IN A YEAR OR TWO IT WOULD MAKE VERY NICE VINEGAR BUT THEY SAID THEY WANTED IT THAT VERY AFTERNOON
BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN READ BY THEIR NEIGHBORS IN THEIR OWN TOWN POST OFFICE BEFORE LEAVING IT MUST HAVE BEEN READ ALONG ITS WAY FOR BY EACH MAIL CAME PILES OF POSTALS AND LETTERS FROM TOWN AFTER TOWN IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION AND ALL IN THE SAME TONE
BUT FOUND HE HAD GONE OUT OF TOWN FOR A DAY'S JOB BUT HIS WIFE TOLD THEM THAT HE ALWAYS CAME BACK AT NIGHT TO RING THE NINE O'CLOCK BELL WE MUST WAIT TILL THEN SAID MISTER PETERKIN WITH AN EFFORT AT CHEERFULNESS AT HOME HE FOUND AGAMEMNON READING HIS BOOK
BUT WHEN SHE WAS TOLD WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS SHE VERY KINDLY SAID THEY MIGHT DRAW UP THE CURTAIN FROM THE WINDOW AT THE FOOT OF THE BED AND OPEN THE BLINDS AND SHE WOULD SEE THEN SHE ASKED FOR HER OPERA GLASS AND LOOKED THROUGH IT ACROSS THE WAY UP THE STREET TO MISSUS PETERKIN'S DOOR
INDEED THERE ISN'T A KIND OF HERB YOU CAN THINK OF THAT THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN DIDN'T HAVE DONE UP IN HER LITTLE PAPER BAGS
ONLY PUT ON YOUR INDIA RUBBER BOOTS AND THEY HURRIED OUT OF THE HOUSE THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA WAS JUST GOING IN TO HER DINNER BUT SHE KINDLY STOPPED IN THE ENTRY TO HEAR WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
HOW COULD THEY MANAGE IT AGAMEMNON HAD BEEN TO COLLEGE AND THE CHILDREN ALL WENT TO SCHOOL BUT STILL AS A FAMILY THEY WERE NOT WISE IT COMES FROM BOOKS SAID ONE OF THE FAMILY
AT LAST SAID MISSUS PETERKIN RATHER UNCERTAINLY SUPPOSE WE ASK THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA WHAT IS BEST TO BE DONE BUT MISTER PETERKIN SAID HE DIDN'T LIKE TO GO TO HER FOR EVERYTHING LET THE CHILDREN TRY AND EAT THEIR DINNER AS IT WAS
ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS FROM THE OPPOSITE HOUSE LOOKING OUT JUST THEN CALLED OUT TO THEM TO TRY THE WHIP THERE WAS A HIGH WIND AND THEY COULD NOT HEAR EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID I HAVE TRIED THE WHIP SAID ELIZABETH ELIZA SHE SAYS WHIPS
MISSUS PETERKIN TASTED EACH AND SAID THE FLAVOR WAS PLEASANT BUT NOT PRECISELY THAT OF COFFEE
BUT THERE WAS NO LITTLE OLD WOMAN SHE HAD GONE UP INTO THE WOODS TO GET SOME MORE WILD HERBS SO THEY ALL THOUGHT THEY WOULD FOLLOW HER ELIZABETH ELIZA SOLOMON JOHN AND THE LITTLE BOYS
THERE WAS A FAMILY SHOUT THE TROUBLE WAS IN THE WEIGHT SAID THE CARPENTER THAT IS WHY IT IS CALLED A DUMB WAITER

THEN SHE TRIED A LITTLE FLAGROOT AND SNAKEROOT THEN SOME SPRUCE GUM AND SOME CARAWAY AND SOME DILL SOME RUE AND ROSEMARY
BUT WHERE ARE THE BOOKS SO THEY SAT AND THOUGHT A LITTLE WHILE WHEN SOLOMON JOHN EXCLAIMED I WILL MAKE A BOOK THEY ALL LOOKED AT HIM IN WONDER YES SAID SOLOMON JOHN

YES SAID AGAMEMNON THEY FOUND THERE POTS AND KETTLES NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THEY DID IT AND I MEAN TO BORROW A BOOK AND READ I THINK IT WAS DONE WITH A PICKAXE SO THE PARTY SET OUT BUT WHEN MISTER PETERKIN REACHED THE CARPENTER'S SHOP
UNGRATEFULLY SAID IT TASTED OF ANYTHING BUT COFFEE THE CHEMIST WAS NOT DISCOURAGED HE PUT IN A LITTLE BELLADONNA AND ATROPINE SOME GRANULATED HYDROGEN SOME POTASH
SO MISTER PETERKIN FOUND IN THE NEWSPAPER THIS GAVE AGAMEMNON A PRETTY LITTLE SUM HE SAT HIMSELF DOWN TO DO IT BUT THERE WAS THE COFFEE ALL SAT AND THOUGHT AWHILE TILL ELIZABETH ELIZA SAID
ELIZABETH ELIZA THOUGHT THE POSTAL A BRIGHT IDEA
WHY DID WE NOT THINK OF THAT BEFORE SAID MISSUS PETERKIN WHAT SHALL WE DO WHEN THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA GOES HOME AGAIN
FIRST ONE OF LEAN THAN ONE OF FAT THEN TWO SLICES OF LEAN AND SO ON MISTER PETERKIN BEGAN AS USUAL BY HELPING THE CHILDREN FIRST ACCORDING TO THEIR AGE NOW AGAMEMNON WHO LIKED LEAN GOT A FAT SLICE
WHY THE PETERKINS HAD A LATE DINNER THE TROUBLE WAS IN THE DUMB WAITER ALL HAD SEATED THEMSELVES AT THE DINNER TABLE AND AMANDA HAD GONE TO TAKE OUT THE DINNER SHE HAD SENT UP FROM THE KITCHEN ON THE DUMB WAITER
WHO SWALLOWED IT DOWN VERY QUICKLY THAT IS JUST WHAT HE WANTED SAID MISSUS PETERKIN NOW HE WILL CERTAINLY GO SO THEY ALL GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE AGAIN AND PUT IN THE CURRANTS AND THE GOOSEBERRIES AND THE FLOWERS
AND A BRANDY CHERRY TREE SHADED THE DOOR AND A LUXURIANT CRANBERRY VINE FLUNG ITS DELICIOUS FRUIT ACROSS THE WINDOW THEY WENT INTO A SMALL PARLOR WHICH SMELT VERY SPICY
BUT MISSUS PETERKIN DIDN'T LIKE THAT THEN HE ADDED SOME TARTARIC ACID AND SOME HYPERSULPHATE OF LIME BUT NO IT WAS NO BETTER I HAVE IT EXCLAIMED THE CHEMIST A LITTLE AMMONIA IS JUST THE THING
NO DINNER EXCLAIMED AGAMEMNON I AM QUITE HUNGRY SAID SOLOMON JOHN AT LAST MISTER PETERKIN SAID I AM NOT PROUD I AM WILLING TO DINE IN THE KITCHEN THIS ROOM WAS BELOW THE DINING ROOM ALL CONSENTED TO THIS
AND THEY ALL WENT BACK REJOICING SO SOLOMON JOHN SAT DOWN AND THE FAMILY ALL SAT ROUND THE TABLE LOOKING AT HIM HE HAD HIS PEN HIS INK AND HIS PAPER HE DIPPED HIS PEN INTO THE INK AND HELD IT OVER THE PAPER AND THOUGHT A MINUTE
SO THEY WENT INTO THE PARLOR AND SAT DOWN TO MAKE A BOOK BUT THERE WAS NO INK WHAT SHOULD HE DO FOR INK ELIZABETH ELIZA SAID SHE HAD HEARD THAT NUTGALLS AND VINEGAR MADE VERY GOOD INK
AND WOULDN'T SHE COME AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD DO
AND GET A QUILL BUT IT WAS ALREADY DARK THEY HAD HOWEVER TWO LANTERNS AND THE LITTLE BOYS BORROWED THE NEIGHBORS THEY SET OUT IN PROCESSION FOR THE POULTRY YARD
WITH THE HONEYSUCKLE VINES BEHIND HER IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TOO MOONLIGHT EVENINGS
FOR THE CHEMIST LIVED OVER THE WAY AND WAS A VERY WISE MAN MISSUS PETERKIN SAID YES AND MISTER PETERKIN SAID VERY WELL AND ALL THE CHILDREN SAID THEY WOULD GO TOO
AND ELIZABETH ELIZA WANTED TO PICK SOME FLOWERS TO TAKE TO THE MINISTER'S WIFE SO IT TOOK THEM A LONG TIME TO PREPARE THE LITTLE BOYS WENT OUT TO PICK THE CURRANTS AND THE GOOSEBERRIES AND ELIZABETH ELIZA WENT OUT FOR HER FLOWERS
THAT THE MAIL WAS ABOUT IN AND PERHAPS HE SHOULD HAVE A LETTER AND THEN THEY COULD USE THE ENVELOPE TO WRITE UPON SO THEY ALL WENT TO THE POST OFFICE AND THE LITTLE BOYS HAD THEIR INDIA RUBBER BOOTS ON AND THEY ALL SHOUTED WHEN THEY FOUND MISTER PETERKIN HAD A LETTER
AND KNEW A GREAT DEAL THEY ALL SHOUTED WITH JOY AT THE IDEA OF ASKING HER AND SOLOMON JOHN AND THE YOUNGER CHILDREN AGREED TO GO AND FIND HER TOO
AFTER THEY HAD GONE THE FAMILY ALL CAME IN TO LOOK AT THE PIANO BUT THEY FOUND THE CARTERS HAD PLACED IT WITH ITS BACK TURNED TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM STANDING CLOSE AGAINST THE WINDOW HOW COULD ELIZABETH ELIZA OPEN IT
THERE WERE SHANGHAIS AND COCHIN CHINAS AND GUINEA HENS AND BARBARY HENS AND SPECKLED HENS AND POLAND ROOSTERS AND BANTAMS AND DUCKS AND TURKEYS BUT NOT ONE GOOSE NO GEESE BUT OURSELVES SAID MISSUS PETERKIN WITTILY
NOW HIS WIFE WAS JUST CONSENTING WHEN THE PETERKIN FAMILY BURST IN YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MAD THE CHEMIST WAS HE CAME NEAR THROWING HIS CRUCIBLE THAT WAS THE NAME OF HIS MELTING POT AT THEIR HEADS BUT HE DIDN'T
AND WENT BACK TO HER HOUSE THERE SHE STOPPED AND STUFFED HER HUGE POCKETS WITH SOME OF ALL THE KINDS OF HERBS SHE TOOK SOME TANSY AND PEPPERMINT AND CARAWAY SEED AND DILL SPEARMINT AND CLOVES
SO THEY DECIDED TO MAKE SOME THE LITTLE BOYS SAID THEY COULD FIND SOME NUTGALLS UP IN THE WOODS SO THEY ALL AGREED TO SET OUT AND PICK SOME MISSUS PETERKINS PUT ON HER CAPE BONNET
AND SOLOMON JOHN TO SCHOOL AND MISSUS PETERKIN BEGAN TO GET READY FOR HER RIDE SHE HAD SOME CURRANTS SHE WANTED TO CARRY TO OLD MISSUS TWOMLY AND SOME GOOSEBERRIES FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
AND PLAY UPON THE PIANO THERE SO THEY TRIED THIS AND THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY SIGHT TO SEE ELIZABETH ELIZA PLAYING ON THE PIANO
AND HE HAD A LARGE GLASS BOTTLE INTO WHICH HE PUT ALL KINDS OF GOLD AND SILVER AND MANY OTHER VALUABLE THINGS AND MELTED THEM ALL UP OVER THE FIRE TILL HE HAD ALMOST FOUND WHAT HE WANTED
HE PACKED UP HIS BOTTLES IN A LEATHER CASE AND WENT BACK WITH THEM ALL FIRST HE LOOKED AT THE COFFEE AND THEN STIRRED IT THEN HE PUT IN A LITTLE CHLORATE OF POTASSIUM AND THE FAMILY TRIED IT ALL ROUND BUT IT TASTED NO BETTER
AND THEY HAD TO WALK A GREAT WAY BEFORE THEY FOUND ANY NUTGALLS AT LAST THEY CAME HOME WITH A LARGE BASKET AND TWO NUTGALLS IN IT THEN CAME THE QUESTION OF THE VINEGAR
MISTER AND MISSUS PETERKIN HOWEVER LIKED BOTH FAT AND LEAN AND WERE MAKING A VERY GOOD MEAL WHEN THEY LOOKED UP AND SAW THE CHILDREN ALL SITTING EATING NOTHING AND LOOKING DISSATISFIED INTO THEIR PLATES WHAT IS THE MATTER NOW
THE FAMILY CAME IN THEY ALL TASTED AND LOOKED AND WONDERED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AND ALL SAT DOWN TO THINK AT LAST AGAMEMNON WHO HAD BEEN TO COLLEGE SAID WHY DON'T WE GO OVER AND ASK THE ADVICE OF THE CHEMIST
BUT SOMETHING WAS THE MATTER SHE COULD NOT PULL IT UP THERE WAS THE DINNER BUT SHE COULD NOT REACH IT ALL THE FAMILY IN TURN WENT AND TRIED ALL PULLED TOGETHER IN VAIN THE DINNER COULD NOT BE STIRRED
NOW MISSUS PETERKIN NEVER LIKED TO USE THE WHIP BUT AS THE HORSE WOULD NOT GO SHE SAID SHE WOULD GET OUT AND TURN HER HEAD THE OTHER WAY WHILE ELIZABETH ELIZA WHIPPED THE HORSE AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO GO SHE WOULD HURRY AND GET IN
AT LAST ELIZABETH ELIZA SAID THEY SAY THAT THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA WHO IS STAYING IN TOWN IS VERY WISE SUPPOSE I GO AND ASK HER WHAT IS BEST TO BE DONE TO THIS THEY ALL AGREED IT WAS A GREAT THOUGHT
WITH THE CHILDREN TAKING HER STICK MEANWHILE MISSUS PETERKIN WAS GETTING QUITE IMPATIENT FOR HER COFFEE
HE COULD TURN THINGS INTO ALMOST GOLD BUT JUST NOW HE HAD USED UP ALL THE GOLD THAT HE HAD ROUND THE HOUSE AND GOLD WAS HIGH HE HAD USED UP HIS WIFE'S GOLD THIMBLE
AND THE LITTLE BOYS GOT INTO THEIR INDIA RUBBER BOOTS AND OFF THEY WENT THE NUTGALLS WERE HARD TO FIND
SUPPOSE WE GO AND ASK THE MINISTER'S WIFE SAID ELIZABETH ELIZA SO THEY ALL WENT TO THE MINISTER'S WIFE SHE SAID IF THEY WANTED SOME GOOD VINEGAR THEY HAD BETTER SET A BARREL OF CIDER DOWN IN THE CELLAR
AND HOW THEY WENT FOR THE LITTLE OLD HERB WOMAN AND HOW SHE HAD TRIED IN VAIN FOR HER MOTHER COULDN'T DRINK THE COFFEE THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA LISTENED VERY ATTENTIVELY AND THEN SAID
ANXIOUS TO FIND A BRIGHT POINT LET US SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT IT SAID MISTER PETERKIN I HAVE AN IDEA SAID AGAMEMNON AFTER A WHILE LET US HEAR IT SAID MISTER PETERKIN LET EACH ONE SPEAK HIS MIND
HE WAS DOWN ON HIS KNEES BEFORE HIS WIFE ASKING HER TO LET HIM HAVE HER WEDDING RING
ALL AROUND HUNG LITTLE BAGS FULL OF CATNIP AND PEPPERMINT AND ALL KINDS OF HERBS AND DRIED STALKS HUNG FROM THE CEILING AND ON THE SHELVES WERE JARS OF RHUBARB SENNA MANNA AND THE LIKE
IF THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA WERE AWAY
I HAVE OBSERVED THAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK A GREAT DEAL OF THINKING SO THEY ALL SAT AND THOUGHT A GREAT WHILE THEN SAID AGAMEMNON I WILL MAKE A LIBRARY THERE ARE SOME BOARDS IN THE WOOD SHED
ELIZABETH ELIZA PRACTICED IN THE MORNINGS WITH HER CLOAK ON BUT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP HER MUSIC IN THE EVENINGS THE FAMILY SHIVERED SO ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS TALKING WITH THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA SHE SPOKE OF THIS TROUBLE
THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AGAMEMNON LOOKED AT ELIZABETH ELIZA AND SOLOMON JOHN LOOKED AT THE LITTLE BOYS WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF THAT SAID THEY AND RAN HOME TO TELL THEIR MOTHER
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO HAVE A CARPENTER ASKED ELIZABETH ELIZA A CARPENTER MIGHT HAVE A LADDER AND AN AXE AND I THINK WE HAVE NEITHER SAID MISSUS PETERKIN A CARPENTER A CARPENTER EXCLAIMED THE REST
THE PETERKINS AT THE FARM IT MAY BE REMEMBERED THAT THE PETERKINS ORIGINALLY HESITATED ABOUT PUBLISHING THEIR FAMILY PAPERS AND WERE DECIDED BY REFERRING THE MATTER TO THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA
AND THEY ALL TRIED BUT THEY COULDN'T VERY WELL THEN SAID MISTER PETERKIN LET THEM GO AND ASK THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA ALL OF US CRIED ONE OF THE LITTLE BOYS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT YES SAID MISSUS PETERKIN
THE CHILDREN TASTED AFTER EACH MIXTURE BUT MADE UP DREADFUL FACES MISSUS PETERKIN TASTED AND DID THE SAME THE MORE THE OLD WOMAN STIRRED AND THE MORE SHE PUT IN
MISTER PETERKIN SAT DOWN TO CUT THE HAM BUT THE HAM TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY REMARKABLE ONE THE FAT AND THE LEAN CAME IN SEPARATE SLICES
AND SOUR SOME OPPERMINT AND SAPPERMINT A LITTLE SPEARMINT AND PEPPERMINT SOME WILD THYME AND SOME OF THE OTHER TAME TIME
SO NOW ALTHOUGH THE CHILDREN SAW UPON THEIR PLATES APPLE SAUCE AND SQUASH AND TOMATO AND SWEET POTATO AND SOUR POTATO NOT ONE OF THEM COULD EAT A MOUTHFUL BECAUSE NOT ONE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE MEAT
SO THE BOYS PUT ON THEIR INDIA RUBBER BOOTS AGAIN AND THEY SET OFF IT WAS A LONG WALK THROUGH THE VILLAGE BUT THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE HERB WOMAN'S HOUSE AT THE FOOT OF A HIGH HILL THEY WENT THROUGH HER LITTLE GARDEN
A PART OF THE FAMILY THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT DO THE REST WANTED TEA I SUPPOSE YOU REMEMBER THE WISE LADY OF PHILADELPHIA WHO WAS HERE NOT LONG AGO SAID MISTER PETERKIN OH YES SAID MISSUS PETERKIN
THAT IT WAS ONLY HIS FAMILY VISITING HIS HENS AFTER THE CROWD HAD DISPERSED SOLOMON JOHN SAT DOWN TO THINK OF HIS WRITING AGAIN AGAMEMNON AGREED TO GO OVER TO THE BOOKSTORE TO GET A QUILL
IT WAS DECIDED THAT MISTER PETERKIN SOLOMON JOHN AND THE LITTLE BOYS SHOULD GO IN SEARCH OF A CARPENTER AGAMEMNON PROPOSED THAT MEANWHILE HE SHOULD GO AND BORROW A BOOK FOR HE HAD ANOTHER IDEA
SO THE OLD WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD AND MUTTERED A FEW WORDS AND SAID SHE MUST GO SHE BELIEVED THE COFFEE WAS BEWITCHED SHE BUNDLED UP HER PACKETS OF HERBS AND TOOK HER TROWEL
AGAMEMNON AND ELIZABETH ELIZA TOLD HER ALL THE DIFFICULTY AND THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA SAID BUT WHY DON'T YOU GIVE THE SLICES OF FAT TO THOSE WHO LIKE THE FAT AND THE SLICES OF LEAN TO THOSE WHO LIKE THE LEAN
BUT THE LITTLE BOYS HAD THEIR INDIA RUBBER BOOTS AT LAST THEY DISCOVERED THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN THEY KNEW HER BY HER HAT IT WAS STEEPLE CROWNED WITHOUT ANY VANE THEY SAW HER DIGGING WITH HER TROWEL ROUND A SASSAFRAS BUSH
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A GREAT MANY BOOKS ARE VERY WISE THEN THEY COUNTED UP THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW BOOKS IN THE HOUSE A FEW SCHOOL BOOKS AND MISSUS PETERKIN'S COOK BOOK WERE ALL THAT'S THE THING SAID AGAMEMNON
WE WANT A LIBRARY WE WANT A LIBRARY SAID SOLOMON JOHN AND ALL OF THEM EXCLAIMED WE WANT A LIBRARY LET US THINK HOW WE SHALL GET ONE SAID MISSUS PETERKIN
AND HER BASKET AND HER STICK AND WENT BACK TO HER ROOT OF SASSAFRAS THAT SHE HAD LEFT HALF IN THE AIR AND HALF OUT AND ALL SHE WOULD TAKE FOR PAY WAS FIVE CENTS IN CURRENCY
AGAMEMNON HAD A STEEL ONE BUT SOLOMON JOHN SAID POETS ALWAYS USED QUILLS
SAID MISTER PETERKIN BUT THE CHILDREN WERE TAUGHT NOT TO SPEAK AT TABLE AGAMEMNON HOWEVER MADE A SIGN OF DISGUST AT HIS FAT AND ELIZABETH ELIZA AT HER LEAN AND SO ON AND THEY PRESENTLY DISCOVERED WHAT WAS THE DIFFICULTY
ELIZABETH ELIZA SHOOK THE REINS AND PULLED THEM AND THEN SHE CLUCKED TO THE HORSE AND MISSUS PETERKIN CLUCKED AND THE LITTLE BOYS WHISTLED AND SHOUTED BUT STILL THE HORSE WOULD NOT GO WE SHALL HAVE TO WHIP HIM SAID ELIZABETH ELIZA
AND THEN SAID BUT I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING TO SAY
MISSUS PETERKIN WISHES TO GO TO DRIVE ONE MORNING MISSUS PETERKIN WAS FEELING VERY TIRED AS SHE HAD BEEN HAVING A GREAT MANY THINGS TO THINK OF AND SHE SAID TO MISTER PETERKIN I BELIEVE I SHALL TAKE A RIDE THIS MORNING
A LITTLE UNCERTAIN OF WHETHER SHE MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE AT PHILADELPHIA THEY DETERMINED TO WRITE AND ASK HER SOLOMON JOHN SUGGESTED A POSTAL CARD EVERYBODY READS A POSTAL AND EVERYBODY WOULD READ IT AS IT CAME ALONG AND SEE ITS IMPORTANCE AND HELP IT ON
ELIZABETH ELIZA WAS THE ONLY DAUGHTER SHE WAS NAMED AFTER HER TWO AUNTS ELIZABETH FROM THE SISTER OF HER FATHER ELIZA FROM HER MOTHER'S SISTER NOW THE HERB WOMAN WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO CAME ROUND TO SELL HERBS
THE THEORY REMAINED THE SAME ALTHOUGH THE EXPERIMENT HAD FAILED PERHAPS A LITTLE STARCH WOULD HAVE SOME EFFECT IF NOT THAT WAS ALL THE TIME HE COULD GIVE HE SHOULD LIKE TO BE PAID AND GO THEY WERE ALL MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM AND WILLING TO GIVE HIM
THIS AFFAIR OF THE TURKEY HE SAID REMINDS ME OF THOSE BURIED CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DUG OUT HERCULANEUM FOR INSTANCE OH YES INTERRUPTED ELIZABETH ELIZA
AND ELIZABETH ELIZA SHOOK THE REINS AND THEY ALL CLUCKED BUT STILL THE HORSE WOULD NOT GO WE MUST EITHER GIVE UP OUR RIDE SAID MISSUS PETERKIN MOURNFULLY OR ELSE SEND OVER TO THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA AND SEE WHAT SHE WILL SAY
SO THE LITTLE BOYS PUT ON THEIR INDIA RUBBER BOOTS AND OVER THEY WENT NOW THE CHEMIST WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT SOMETHING
AND GAVE THEM A CUPFUL TO CARRY HOME SO THEY STIRRED IN THE NUTGALLS AND BY THE TIME EVENING CAME THEY HAD VERY GOOD INK THEN SOLOMON JOHN WANTED A PEN
AGAMEMNON AND SOLOMON JOHN TOOK THE POSTAL CARD TO THE POST OFFICE EARLY ONE MORNING AND BY THE AFTERNOON OF THAT VERY DAY AND ALL THE NEXT DAY AND FOR MANY DAYS CAME STREAMING IN ANSWERS ON POSTALS AND ON LETTERS
SQUASH TOMATO POTATO AND SWEET POTATO MISSUS PETERKIN CONTINUED SWEET POTATO EXCLAIMED BOTH THE LITTLE BOYS I AM VERY GLAD NOW THAT I DID NOT HAVE CRANBERRY SAID MISSUS PETERKIN
THEIR CARD HAD BEEN ADDRESSED TO THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA WITH THE NUMBER OF HER STREET
THEN THE FAMILY WERE IN DESPAIR AND ALL SAT AND THOUGHT A GREAT WHILE
AND FOUND THE CARPENTER THEY ASKED HIM TO BRING A LADDER AXES AND PICKAXE
THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA LOOKED SURPRISED AND THEN SAID BUT WHY DON'T YOU TURN THE PIANO ROUND ONE OF THE LITTLE BOYS PERTLY SAID IT IS A SQUARE PIANO
AND I HAVE A HAMMER AND SOME NAILS AND PERHAPS WE CAN BORROW SOME HINGES AND THERE WE HAVE OUR LIBRARY THEY WERE ALL VERY MUCH PLEASED AT THE IDEA THAT'S THE BOOK CASE PART SAID ELIZABETH ELIZA
NO IT WASN'T THE THING AT ALL THEN HE TRIED EACH IN TURN SOME OXALIC CYANIC ACETIC PHOSPHORIC CHLORIC HYPERCHLORIC SULPHURIC BORACIC
AND A VERY LITTLE ANTIMONY FINISHING OFF WITH A LITTLE PURE CARBON BUT STILL MISSUS PETERKIN WAS NOT SATISFIED
THEY ALL WENT OVER WITH HIM THE BOOKSELLER WAS JUST SHUTTING UP HIS SHOP HOWEVER HE AGREED TO GO IN AND GET A QUILL WHICH HE DID AND THEY HURRIED HOME SO SOLOMON JOHN SAT DOWN AGAIN BUT THERE WAS NO PAPER AND NOW THE BOOKSTORE WAS SHUT UP MISTER PETERKIN SUGGESTED
AND MISSUS PETERKIN PUT ON HER CAPE BONNET AND IN TIME THEY WERE ALL READY THE LITTLE BOYS WERE IN THEIR INDIA RUBBER BOOTS AND THEY GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE ELIZABETH ELIZA WAS TO DRIVE
IT TASTED BAD WHAT SHOULD SHE DO OF COURSE SHE COULDN'T DRINK THE COFFEE SO SHE CALLED IN THE FAMILY
SO THEY HAD TEA AND AS IT PROVED ALL SAT DOWN TO IT BUT NOT MUCH WAS EATEN
AND OFF ELIZABETH ELIZA WENT SHE TOLD THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA THE WHOLE STORY HOW HER MOTHER HAD PUT SALT IN THE COFFEE HOW THE CHEMIST HAD BEEN CALLED IN HOW HE TRIED EVERYTHING BUT COULD MAKE IT NO BETTER
EACH ONE WENT DOWN TAKING A NAPKIN THE COOK LAID THE KITCHEN TABLE PUT ON IT HER BEST TABLE CLOTH AND THE FAMILY SAT DOWN AMANDA WENT TO THE DUMB WAITER FOR THE DINNER BUT SHE COULD NOT MOVE IT DOWN THE FAMILY WERE ALL IN DISMAY
THIS WAS MISSUS PETERKIN IT WAS A MISTAKE SHE HAD POURED OUT A DELICIOUS CUP OF COFFEE AND JUST AS SHE WAS HELPING HERSELF TO CREAM
WHAT SHALL BE DONE NOW SAID MISSUS PETERKIN
SO THEY TRIED THIS BUT THE HORSE WOULD NOT STIR PERHAPS WE HAVE TOO HEAVY A LOAD SAID MISSUS PETERKIN AS SHE GOT IN SO THEY TOOK OUT THE CURRANTS AND THE GOOSEBERRIES AND THE FLOWERS BUT STILL THE HORSE WOULD NOT GO
LET US TRY TO THINK WHAT SHE WOULD ADVISE US SAID MISTER PETERKIN I WISH SHE WERE HERE SAID ELIZABETH ELIZA I THINK SAID MISTER PETERKIN SHE WOULD SAY LET THEM THAT WANT TEA HAVE IT THE REST CAN GO WITHOUT
BUT GO ON WITH YOUR STORY ONE DAY SHORTLY AFTER THE DEATH OF THE QUEEN CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN YOUR HIGHNESS WAS HUNTING AND OUTSTRIPPED ALL YOUR ATTENDANTS WHILE CHASING THE DEER YOU WERE IN A PART OF THE COUNTRY WHICH YOU DID NOT KNOW
HERE I AM SAID VAMPA INSTANTLY APPEARING WHAT DO YOU WANT TAKE MY LAST GOLD MUTTERED DANGLARS HOLDING OUT HIS POCKET BOOK AND LET ME LIVE HERE I ASK NO MORE FOR LIBERTY I ONLY ASK TO LIVE THEN YOU SUFFER A GREAT DEAL
AND THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT BE MORE LUCKY THE THIRD TIME SO BACK HE WENT TO THE OLD PLACE WILT THOU WED ME FARMER'S DAUGHTER HE SAID TO THE YOUNGEST INDEED I WILL WED THEE A PRETTY CREATURE IS THE HOODIE ANSWERED SHE
HAD NOT HIS GRANDFATHER THE DUKE STEPPED BETWEEN AND COMMANDED US TO LAY THE AFFAIR BEFORE YOU THE KING HAD LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE STORY AND WHEN IT WAS ENDED HE SAID I SUPPOSE THE PRINCE HAD NO ARMS WITH HIM OR ELSE HE WOULD HAVE USED THEM
TO THIS HE REPLIED THAT AS MY MISFORTUNE RESULTED FROM A SPELL THIS WAS RATHER DIFFICULT BUT HE WOULD DO HIS BEST AND AT ANY RATE HE COULD PROMISE THAT BEFORE MY FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY
AND THE REAL COOK WHO HAD COME BACK FROM THE RACE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE HIM HE MAY BE THE COOK BUT HE DID NOT COOK THIS FEAST SAID THE BRIDEGROOM AND THEN INQUIRY WAS MADE AND THE GIRL WAS SUMMONED TO THE GREAT HALL THAT IS MY MARRIED WIFE HE DECLARED
COULD THAT REALLY BE HIS WIFE THAT BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE THE PRINCE WAS STILL GAZING IN SURPRISE WHEN THE LADY OPENED HER EYES AND SMILED AT HIM YES I REALLY AM YOUR WIFE SHE SAID AS IF SHE HAD GUESSED HIS THOUGHTS
ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION AND CALLED OUT WITH EVERY PULSATION OF HIS HEART THOU SHALT DIE DANGLARS RESEMBLED A TIMID ANIMAL EXCITED IN THE CHASE
AND THE HOODIE WAS MORE ANGRY THAN BEFORE AND WENT AWAY IN A RAGE HOWEVER
AS HE SPOKE THE YOUNG MAN LAID THE JEWELS AT THE FEET OF THE KING AND THE NOBLES AND THE JUDGES PRESSED ROUND TO EXAMINE THEM THE KING ALONE DID NOT MOVE FROM HIS SEAT FOR HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE HALL OF JUSTICE AND ALL ABOUT HIM
YES YOUR EXCELLENCY WHAT THEN
AND GAVE HER A SOFT BED TO LIE ON AND THE HOODIE'S WIFE LAY DOWN AND SO TIRED WAS SHE THAT IT SEEMED TO HER BUT A MOMENT BEFORE THE SUN ROSE AND SHE AWOKE AGAIN FROM HILL TO HILL SHE WENT AFTER THE HOODIE
HERE LET ME SEE HIM CERTAINLY AND THE NEXT MOMENT LUIGI VAMPA APPEARED BEFORE DANGLARS YOU SENT FOR ME HE SAID TO THE PRISONER
THIS DAY EVERYTHING BEFELL AS ON THE TWO OTHER DAYS BUT WHEN SHE REACHED THE SMALL HOUSE THE WOMAN BADE HER KEEP AWAKE AND IF THE HOODIE FLEW INTO THE ROOM TO TRY TO SEIZE HIM
IT IS SO HARD TO LEAVE THE WORLD AND GO OUT INTO THE DARKNESS YOU WILL NOT NEED TO DO THAT ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN YOU HAVE ONLY GOT TO MARRY ME AND YOU WILL SOON BE FREE MARRY YOU EXCLAIMED HE BUT BUT I AM NOT YET TWENTY AND YOU
BUT THEY WERE MORE AMAZED STILL AT THE LIGHTNESS OF HER STEP AS SHE SKIPPED UP THE STEPS TO THE GREAT DOOR BEFORE WHICH THE KING WAS STANDING WITH THE PRINCE AT HIS SIDE IF THEY BOTH FELT A SHOCK AT THE APPEARANCE OF THE AGED LADY THEY DID NOT SHOW IT
AND FINALLY HE PRAYED THAT THIS SUM MIGHT BE PRESERVED TO HIM AND AS HE PRAYED HE WEPT THREE DAYS PASSED THUS DURING WHICH HIS PRAYERS WERE FREQUENT IF NOT HEARTFELT
BUT TO DIE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE DANGLARS CONTEMPLATED DEATH WITH A MIXTURE OF DREAD AND DESIRE THE TIME HAD COME WHEN THE IMPLACABLE SPECTRE WHICH EXISTS IN THE MIND OF EVERY HUMAN CREATURE
THAN KNOW THAT HE WOULD SUFFER SUCH AN INJURY WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO AVENGE IT AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN WHO STRUCK HIM HE WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE MY JUDGES AND WILL PLEAD HIS OWN CAUSE BUT I HARDLY THINK HE CAN ESCAPE DEATH AFTER HAVING ASSAULTED THE HEIR TO THE CROWN
SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CARED ABOUT ME AND WE LIVED TOGETHER IN THIS CITY ON A SMALL PENSION ALLOWED ME BY THE KING WHEN I WAS ABOUT THREE AN OLD MAN ARRIVED AT OUR HOUSE AND BEGGED MY NURSE TO LET HIM COME IN AND REST AS HE COULD WALK NO LONGER
AT LAST WE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM THE WIZARD WHO TOLD US WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT COURT AND YOUR STORY BIDDING ME TO PUT MYSELF IN YOUR WAY WHEN YOU HAD LOST ALL HOPE AND OFFER TO SAVE YOU IF YOU WOULD CONSENT TO MARRY ME
AND SAW ONLY THE APPLE ORCHARD AS IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL PLAYING AT BALL A SUDDEN SILENCE ROUND HIM MADE HIM LOOK UP AND HE FOUND THE EYES OF THE ASSEMBLY FIXED ON HIM IT IS TRUE
FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS LITTLE WAS SEEN OF THE PRINCE WHO SPENT ALL HIS DAYS IN HUNTING AND TRYING TO FORGET THE OLD WIFE AT HOME AS FOR THE PRINCESS NO ONE TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT HER AND SHE PASSED THE DAYS ALONE IN HER APARTMENTS
HE HAD CONCEALED HALF OF HIS FOWL AND A PIECE OF THE BREAD IN THE CORNER OF HIS CELL BUT HE HAD NO SOONER EATEN THAN HE FELT THIRSTY HE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HE STRUGGLED AGAINST HIS THIRST TILL HIS TONGUE CLAVE TO THE ROOF OF HIS MOUTH
AND EVERYONE MEANT TO BE THERE EXCEPT THE STRANGER WHO HAD COME OVER THE HILL OF POISON EVERYONE THAT IS BUT THE COOK WHO WAS TO MAKE THE BRIDAL SUPPER GREATLY HE LOVED RACES AND SORE WAS HIS HEART TO THINK THAT ONE SHOULD BE RUN WITHOUT HIS SEEING IT
I LEAVE MY CAUSE WITHOUT FEAR IN YOUR HANDS KNOWING THAT YOU WILL LISTEN AND JUDGE RIGHTLY AND THAT YOU WILL SUFFER ME TO SPEAK TO THE END BEFORE YOU GIVE JUDGMENT FOR FOUR YEARS YOU O KING HAD BEEN MARRIED TO THE QUEEN AND YET HAD NO CHILDREN
FOR SHE HAD TO GO SOME WAY FORWARDS AND THEN THROW THE HORSE SHOES BACK FOR HIM TO PUT ON STILL AT LAST THEY WERE OVER AND THEY WENT BACK THE WAY SHE HAD COME AND STOPPED AT THE THREE HOUSES IN ORDER TO TAKE THEIR LITTLE SONS TO THEIR OWN HOME
FOR NONE COULD FIND ANY EXCUSE FOR THE BLOW HE HAD GIVEN TO THE PRINCE THE FOURTEENTH NIGHT HAD COME AND IN DESPAIR THE PRISONER WENT OUT TO TAKE HIS LAST WALK THROUGH THE CITY HE WANDERED ON HARDLY KNOWING WHERE HE WENT
THE MARRIAGE SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET AFTER THE CEREMONY YOU GAVE HER THREE RINGS AND A CHARM WITH A CROSS ON IT AND THEN PUT HER IN A COTTAGE IN THE FOREST THINKING TO HIDE THE MATTER SECURELY FOR SOME MONTHS YOU VISITED THE COTTAGE EVERY WEEK
AND THE MAN BECAME A HOODIE AGAIN AND FLEW AWAY THE TWO SISTERS RETURNED HOME BUT THE WIFE FOLLOWED THE HOODIE SOMETIMES SHE WOULD SEE HIM ON A HILL TOP AND THEN WOULD HASTEN AFTER HIM HOPING TO CATCH HIM
AND HOW YOU ARE SEEKING IF IN ANY WISE YOU CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE BUT THERE IS NONE THAT CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION SAVE ONLY I MYSELF IF YOU WILL PROMISE TO DO ALL I ASK AT HER WORDS THE PRISONER FELT AS IF A LOAD HAD ALL AT ONCE BEEN ROLLED OFF HIM
SO HARD DID SHE WORK THAT IN A FEW DAYS SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE HORSE SHOES EARLY ONE MORNING SHE SET OUT FOR THE HILL OF POISON ON HER HANDS AND FEET SHE WENT BUT EVEN WITH THE HORSE SHOES ON SHE HAD TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO STUMBLE
WHEN A NUMBER OF YOUNG NOBLES SUDDENLY APPEARED BEFORE HIM AND ONE AMONGST THEM STEPPED FORWARD AND SPOKE SIRE THIS MORNING WE WERE ALL PLAYING TENNIS IN THE COURT THE PRINCE AND THIS GENTLEMAN WITH THE REST
DANGLARS UTTERED A CRY AND FELL PROSTRATE RISE SAID THE COUNT YOUR LIFE IS SAFE THE SAME GOOD FORTUNE HAS NOT HAPPENED TO YOUR ACCOMPLICES ONE IS MAD
AND HURRIED AWAY DOWN THE STREET LEFT TO HIMSELF THE FULL HORROR OF HIS COMING DEATH RUSHED UPON THE YOUNG MAN AND HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD THROWN AWAY HIS SOLE CHANCE OF LIFE WELL IF HE MUST HE MUST HE SAID TO HIMSELF
FOR IT WAS SUMMER AND EVERYONE ROSE EARLY AND RESTED FROM TWELVE TO THREE AS THEY DO IN HOT COUNTRIES HE HAD DRESSED HIMSELF IN COOL WHITE CLOTHES AND WAS PASSING THROUGH THE HALL ON HIS WAY TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER
BUT BY THE TIME SHE HAD GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL HE WOULD BE IN THE VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE WHEN NIGHT CAME AND SHE WAS TIRED SHE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SOME PLACE TO REST AND GLAD SHE WAS TO SEE A LITTLE HOUSE FULL OF LIGHT STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
I AM HE WHOSE FATHER YOU CONDEMNED TO DIE OF HUNGER I AM HE WHOM YOU ALSO CONDEMNED TO STARVATION AND WHO YET FORGIVES YOU BECAUSE HE HOPES TO BE FORGIVEN
IT IS HE WHO IS MY SON AND NOT THE OTHER HE SAID WITH AN EFFORT AND LET EVERY MAN PRESENT SWEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM AS KING AFTER MY DEATH THEREFORE ONE BY ONE THEY ALL KNELT BEFORE HIM AND TOOK THE OATH
AND HOW HE HAD SWORN BEFORE A PRIEST TO MARRY HER THOUGH HE DID NOT WANT TO DO IT ON ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR AGES AND BESIDES HE WOULD RATHER RECEIVE A BRIDE CHOSEN BY THE KING HIMSELF BUT THE KING FROWNED AND ANSWERED SHARPLY
AND THE HOODIE'S WIFE WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT HER HUSBAND RESOLVED TO TAKE HER AWAY TO ANOTHER HOUSE HE HAD AND HER SISTERS WITH HER FOR COMPANY SO THEY SET OUT IN A COACH WHICH WAS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD THEM AND HAD NOT GONE VERY FAR WHEN THE HOODIE SUDDENLY SAID
A MAN WAS SITTING READING AT THE ONLY OUTLET TO THE CELL AND BEHIND THAT MAN SHAPES ARMED WITH GUNS CONTINUALLY PASSED HIS RESOLUTION NOT TO SIGN LASTED TWO DAYS AFTER WHICH HE OFFERED A MILLION FOR SOME FOOD
COME COME CALM YOURSELF YOU WILL EXCITE YOUR BLOOD AND THAT WOULD PRODUCE AN APPETITE IT WOULD REQUIRE A MILLION A DAY TO SATISFY BE MORE ECONOMICAL BUT WHEN I HAVE NO MORE MONEY LEFT TO PAY YOU
AND WHILE HE SMILED AS HE ATTEMPTED TO REGARD THE AFFAIR AS A JOKE HE FELT HIS TEMPLES GET MOIST WITH PERSPIRATION COME MY FRIEND SAID DANGLARS SEEING THAT HE MADE NO IMPRESSION ON PEPPINO YOU WILL NOT REFUSE ME A GLASS OF WINE
AND A MESSAGE WAS SENT TO THE FALSE PRINCE FORBIDDING HIM EVER AGAIN TO APPEAR AT COURT THOUGH A HANDSOME PENSION WAS GRANTED HIM AT LAST THE CEREMONY WAS OVER AND THE KING SIGNING TO HIS NEWLY FOUND SON TO FOLLOW HIM
SO WHEN HE BEHELD A WOMAN WHOM HE DID NOT KNOW COMING ALONG THE STREET HOPE SPRANG UP IN HIM WILL YOU COOK THE WEDDING FEAST IN PLACE OF ME HE SAID AND I WILL PAY YOU WELL WHEN I RETURN FROM THE RACE GLADLY SHE AGREED
THE GIRL WAS SURPRISED AT HIS WORDS FOR SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT HE COULD BE ANYTHING BUT A HOODIE AT ALL TIMES STILL SHE SAID NOTHING OF THIS AND ONLY REPLIED I WOULD RATHER THOU WERT A MAN BY DAY AND A HOODIE BY NIGHT AND SO HE WAS
BEFORE HIM THE OLD WOMAN BADE THE PRISONER SWEAR THAT SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE AND THIS HE DID IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES THEN BEGGING THE PRIEST AND THE GUARDS TO LEAVE THEM ALONE FOR A LITTLE SHE TOLD THE YOUNG MAN WHAT HE WAS TO DO
AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE THIS WAS NOT EASY AS MY UGLINESS WAS SUCH THAT NO ONE WOULD LOOK AT ME A SECOND TIME MY NURSE AND I WERE ALMOST IN DESPAIR AS MY FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY WAS DRAWING NEAR AND I HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS SPOKEN TO A MAN
THEN SHE LOOKED ROUND FOR SOME PLACE TO REST IN AND SHE BEHELD A LITTLE HOUSE OF LIGHT BEFORE HER AND FAST SHE HURRIED TOWARDS IT AT THE DOOR STOOD A LITTLE BOY AND HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH PLEASURE AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
SHE SAW THAT HE WAS VERY ILL SO PUT HIM TO BED AND TOOK SUCH CARE OF HIM THAT BY AND BYE HE WAS AS STRONG AS EVER IN GRATITUDE FOR HER GOODNESS TO HIM HE TOLD HER THAT HE WAS A WIZARD
AND THE BIRD MUCH OFFENDED SPREAD HIS WINGS AND FLEW AWAY BUT THE FOLLOWING DAY HE CAME BACK AGAIN AND SAID TO THE SECOND GIRL WILT THOU WED ME FARMER'S DAUGHTER INDEED I WILL NOT ANSWERED SHE AN UGLY BRUTE IS THE HOODIE
WHEN THIS MAN IS SATISFIED LET HIM BE FREE DANGLARS REMAINED PROSTRATE WHILE THE COUNT WITHDREW WHEN HE RAISED HIS HEAD HE SAW DISAPPEARING DOWN THE PASSAGE NOTHING BUT A SHADOW BEFORE WHICH THE BANDITS BOWED
THEN NO LONGER ABLE TO RESIST HE CALLED OUT THE SENTINEL OPENED THE DOOR IT WAS A NEW FACE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCE SO HE SENT FOR PEPPINO
I AM NOT THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THEN WHO ARE YOU I AM HE WHOM YOU SOLD AND DISHONORED I AM HE WHOSE BETROTHED YOU PROSTITUTED I AM HE UPON WHOM YOU TRAMPLED THAT YOU MIGHT RAISE YOURSELF TO FORTUNE
ROSE AND WENT INTO ANOTHER ROOM TELL ME HOW YOU KNEW ALL THAT HE SAID THROWING HIMSELF INTO A CARVED CHAIR FILLED WITH CRIMSON CUSHIONS AND THE PRINCE TOLD OF HIS MEETING WITH THE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM THE JEWELS FROM HIS MOTHER
AND SOMETIMES SHE SAW HIM ON THE TOP BUT WHEN SHE GOT TO THE TOP HE HAD FLOWN INTO THE VALLEY AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE VALLEY HE WAS ON THE TOP OF ANOTHER HILL AND SO IT HAPPENED TILL NIGHT CAME ROUND AGAIN
AND THE YOUNG MAN PAUSED AND LOOKED AT THE KING WHO COLOURED DEEPLY SHE WENT BACK TO HER FATHER THE OLD DUKE ONCE YOUR CHAMBERLAIN AND THE CROSS ON HER BREAST REVEALED AT ONCE WHO YOU WERE FIERCE WAS HIS ANGER WHEN HE HEARD HIS DAUGHTER'S TALE
THE NEXT DAY DANGLARS WAS AGAIN HUNGRY CERTAINLY THE AIR OF THAT DUNGEON WAS VERY PROVOCATIVE OF APPETITE THE PRISONER EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD BE AT NO EXPENSE THAT DAY FOR LIKE AN ECONOMICAL MAN
WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE FOLLOW ME AT ONCE
WHO WAS THE INVISIBLE CHIEF WHAT COULD BE HIS INTENTIONS TOWARDS HIM AND WHY WHEN EVERY ONE ELSE WAS ALLOWED TO BE RANSOMED MIGHT HE NOT ALSO BE
SO THAT THE BLOOD RAN FROM HIS MOUTH AND NOSE WE WERE ALL SO HORRIFIED AT THE SIGHT THAT WE SHOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE KILLED THE MAN THEN AND THERE FOR DARING TO LAY HANDS ON THE PRINCE
WHO BY THIS TIME COULD SCARCELY BE SEEN EVEN IN THE MOONLIGHT WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED A WOMAN PAST NINETY COULD WALK WITH SUCH SPEED IT SEEMED MORE LIKE FLYING BUT AT LENGTH BREATHLESS AND EXHAUSTED HE REACHED HER SIDE AND GASPED OUT
IT TOOK SOME TIME TO DISCOVER THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE OLD WOMAN BUT AT LENGTH IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED AT THE PALACE WITH THE EQUERRY SHE WAS RECEIVED WITH ROYAL HONOURS AS BECAME THE BRIDE OF THE PRINCE
SO SEEING AN ORCHARD ALL PINK AND WHITE WITH APPLE BLOSSOMS AND A GIRL TOSSING A BALL IN ONE CORNER
HE REMAINED THERE ALL NIGHT NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS WHEN DAYLIGHT DAWNED
WHERE THE COMPANY OF YOUNG MEN REMAINED SILENT THEN HE CAME BACK HIS FACE WHITE AND STERN I TELL YOU HE SAID AND IT IS THE SOLEMN TRUTH THAT I WOULD RATHER YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT THE PRINCE WAS DEAD THOUGH HE IS MY ONLY SON
I WOULD RATHER DIE AT ONCE YOU MAY TORTURE TORMENT KILL ME BUT YOU SHALL NOT HAVE MY SIGNATURE AGAIN AS YOUR EXCELLENCY PLEASES SAID VAMPA AS HE LEFT THE CELL DANGLARS RAVING THREW HIMSELF ON THE GOAT SKIN WHO COULD THESE MEN BE
NO AND YET YOU WILL LET ME PERISH WITH HUNGER AH THAT IS A DIFFERENT THING WELL THEN WRETCHES CRIED DANGLARS I WILL DEFY YOUR INFAMOUS CALCULATIONS
BY THEIR ADVICE HE SPENT THE FOURTEEN DAYS THAT REMAINED TO HIM GOING ABOUT TO SEEK COUNSEL FROM WISE MEN OF ALL SORTS AS TO HOW HE MIGHT ESCAPE DEATH BUT NO ONE COULD HELP HIM
BY STRIKING THE HEIR TO THE THRONE AND IF SO TO BE QUICK IN SETTING IT FORTH WITH A LOW BOW THE YOUTH MADE ANSWER IN A CLEAR VOICE O MY LORD AND GRACIOUS KING AND YOU NOBLES AND WISE MEN OF THE LAND
BUT NOWHERE COULD THEY FIND IT AND THE FARMER WHO HAD COME TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER WAS GREATLY GRIEVED AS HE FEARED IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD STOLEN IT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT THE HOODIE FOR A SON IN LAW
WHEN THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING AND THE JUDGES THE HALL WAS FULL TO OVERFLOWING WHEN THE PRISONER ENTERED IT AND ALL MARVELLED AT THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS FACE THE KING INQUIRED IF HE HAD ANY EXCUSE TO PLEAD FOR THE HIGH TREASON HE HAD COMMITTED
THE NEXT YEAR THE HOODIE'S WIFE HAD ANOTHER SON AND THIS TIME A WATCH WAS SET AT EVERY DOOR BUT IT WAS NO USE IN VAIN THEY DETERMINED THAT COME WHAT MIGHT THEY WOULD NOT CLOSE THEIR EYES
YOU ARE SURE YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
ASKED THE INFURIATED DANGLARS THEN YOU MUST SUFFER HUNGER SUFFER HUNGER SAID DANGLARS BECOMING PALE MOST LIKELY REPLIED VAMPA COOLLY
BUT THE WIFE HAD WALKED FAR AND WAS VERY TIRED AND STRIVE AS SHE WOULD SHE FELL SOUND ASLEEP MANY HOURS SHE SLEPT AND THE HOODIE ENTERED THROUGH A WINDOW AND LET FALL A RING ON HER HAND
IF YOU DEPRIVE ME OF THAT TAKE AWAY MY LIFE ALSO WE ARE FORBIDDEN TO SHED YOUR BLOOD AND BY WHOM ARE YOU FORBIDDEN BY HIM WE OBEY YOU DO THEN OBEY SOME ONE YES A CHIEF
DO YOU WISH TO ASSASSINATE A MAN WHO IN THE EYES OF HEAVEN IS A BROTHER OH MY FORMER FRIENDS MY FORMER FRIENDS HE MURMURED AND FELL WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND THEN RISING IN DESPAIR HE EXCLAIMED THE CHIEF THE CHIEF
AND A HANDSOMER MAN OR A MORE BEAUTIFUL HOODIE NEVER WAS SEEN THE GIRL LOVED THEM BOTH AND NEVER WISHED FOR THINGS TO BE DIFFERENT BY AND BYE THEY HAD A SON AND VERY PLEASED THEY BOTH WERE
SHE DROPPED THE RING AND THE FEATHER INTO IT AND SET IF HERSELF BEFORE HIM WITH THE FIRST SPOONFUL HE TOOK UP THE RING AND A THRILL RAN THROUGH HIM IN THE SECOND HE BEHELD THE FEATHER AND ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WHO HAS COOKED THIS FEAST ASKED HE
THEY SENT HIM A MAGNIFICENT SUPPER AND TOOK HIS MILLION FROM THIS TIME THE PRISONER RESOLVED TO SUFFER NO LONGER BUT TO HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTED AT THE END OF TWELVE DAYS AFTER HAVING MADE A SPLENDID DINNER
THEN I FORGIVE YOU SAID THE MAN DROPPING HIS CLOAK AND ADVANCING TO THE LIGHT THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO SAID DANGLARS MORE PALE FROM TERROR THAN HE HAD BEEN JUST BEFORE FROM HUNGER AND MISERY YOU ARE MISTAKEN
AND THERE YOU CANNOT FOLLOW HIM WITHOUT HORSE SHOES ON YOUR HANDS AND FEET BUT I WILL HELP YOU PUT ON THIS SUIT OF MEN'S CLOTHES AND GO DOWN THIS ROAD TILL YOU COME TO THE SMITHY AND THERE YOU CAN LEARN TO MAKE HORSE SHOES FOR YOURSELF
FIRST IT FLIES THEN DESPAIRS AND AT LAST BY THE VERY FORCE OF DESPERATION SOMETIMES SUCCEEDS IN ELUDING ITS PURSUERS DANGLARS MEDITATED AN ESCAPE BUT THE WALLS WERE SOLID ROCK
BUT IN THE NIGHT SOFT MUSIC WAS HEARD STEALING CLOSE TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND EVERY MAN SLEPT AND THE MOTHER SLEPT ALSO WHEN THEY WOKE AGAIN IT WAS MORNING AND THE BABY WAS GONE HIGH AND LOW THEY LOOKED FOR IT
SOMETIMES HE WAS DELIRIOUS AND FANCIED HE SAW AN OLD MAN STRETCHED ON A PALLET HE ALSO WAS DYING OF HUNGER ON THE FOURTH HE WAS NO LONGER A MAN BUT A LIVING CORPSE
BUT WHEN HE SAW THE BLOOD POURING FROM HIS FACE HE WENT TO A CORNER OF THE COURT AND BEGAN TO CRY WHICH WAS THE STRANGEST THING OF ALL ON HEARING THIS THE KING WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH HIS BACK TO THE ROOM
AND HIS FACE WAS SO WHITE AND DESPERATE THAT NONE OF HIS COMPANIONS DARED SPEAK TO HIM THE SAD LITTLE PROCESSION HAD PASSED SOME HOURS IN THIS MANNER WHEN NEAR THE GATE OF A MONASTERY AN OLD WOMAN APPEARED ROUND A CORNER
OF WHAT MUST I REPENT STAMMERED DANGLARS OF THE EVIL YOU HAVE DONE SAID THE VOICE
AND ON THE MORROW THEY WERE MARRIED I HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK THEE SAID THE HOODIE WHEN THEY WERE FAR AWAY IN HIS OWN HOUSE WOULDST THOU RATHER I SHOULD BE A HOODIE BY DAY AND A MAN BY NIGHT OR A MAN BY DAY AND A HOODIE BY NIGHT
AND COOKED THE FEAST IN A KITCHEN THAT LOOKED INTO THE GREAT HALL WHERE THE COMPANY WERE TO EAT IT AFTER THAT SHE WATCHED THE SEAT WHERE THE BRIDEGROOM WAS SITTING
HE OFFERED HIM ONE THOUSAND FRANCS FOR A MOUTHFUL OF BREAD BUT PEPPINO DID NOT ANSWER ON THE FIFTH DAY HE DRAGGED HIMSELF TO THE DOOR OF THE CELL ARE YOU NOT A CHRISTIAN HE SAID FALLING ON HIS KNEES
HE WAS THIRSTY AND DRAGGED HIMSELF TOWARDS IT
WHY YOU MUST BE A HUNDRED AT LEAST OH NO IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE HE SPOKE WITHOUT THINKING BUT THE FLASH OF ANGER WHICH DARTED FROM HER EYES MADE HIM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE HOWEVER ALL SHE SAID WAS AS YOU LIKE SINCE YOU REJECT ME LET THE CROWS HAVE YOU
AND ADOPTED IN SECRET THE BABY OF A POOR QUARRYMAN SENDING A MESSENGER TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HAD A SON NO ONE SUSPECTED THE TRUTH EXCEPT A PRIEST TO WHOM THE QUEEN CONFESSED THE TRUTH AND IN A FEW WEEKS SHE FELL ILL AND DIED
AT THE FIRST NOTE OF MUSIC THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN THE FARMER ARRIVED IN THE MORNING TO SEE HIS GRANDSON HE FOUND THEM ALL WEEPING FOR WHILE THEY HAD SLEPT THE BABY HAD VANISHED WELL THE NEXT YEAR IT ALL HAPPENED AGAIN
AND IN FIFTEEN DAYS HE WOULD BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL BEFORE THE HIGHEST JUDGES IN THE LAND THE YOUNG MAN LEFT THE KING'S PRESENCE SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS AND ACCOMPANIED BY MANY OF HIS FRIENDS FOR HE WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE
AND THE KING WITH A GRAVE BOW TOOK HER BAND AND LED HER TO THE CHAPEL WHERE A BISHOP WAS WAITING TO PERFORM THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY
AND SOONER THAN GIVE THEM UP HE RESOLVED TO ENTER AGAIN UPON A LIFE OF PRIVATION HE WAS DELUDED BY THE HOPEFULNESS THAT IS A PREMONITION OF MADNESS HE WHO FOR SO LONG A TIME HAD FORGOTTEN GOD BEGAN TO THINK THAT MIRACLES WERE POSSIBLE
BUT A REBELLION BROKE OUT IN A DISTANT PART OF THE KINGDOM AND CALLED FOR YOUR PRESENCE WHEN NEXT YOU RODE UP TO THE COTTAGE IT WAS EMPTY AND NONE COULD INFORM YOU WHITHER YOUR BRIDE HAD GONE THAT SIRE I CAN NOW TELL YOU
HE RECKONED HIS ACCOUNTS AND FOUND THAT HE HAD ONLY FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS LEFT THEN A STRANGE REACTION TOOK PLACE
KEEP THE FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS YOU HAVE LEFT I GIVE THEM TO YOU THE FIVE MILLION YOU STOLE FROM THE HOSPITALS HAS BEEN RESTORED TO THEM BY AN UNKNOWN HAND AND NOW EAT AND DRINK I WILL ENTERTAIN YOU TO NIGHT VAMPA
THE KING OF GRANADA IS MY FATHER AND I WAS BORN IN THE PALACE WHICH OVERLOOKS THE PLAIN OF THE VEGA I WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS OLD WHEN A WICKED FAIRY WHO HAD A SPITE AGAINST MY PARENTS CAST A SPELL OVER ME
THE GIRL AWOKE WITH A START AND LEANT FORWARD TO GRASP HIM BUT HE WAS ALREADY FLYING OFF AND SHE ONLY SEIZED A FEATHER FROM HIS WING AND WHEN DAWN CAME SHE GOT UP AND TOLD THE WOMAN HE HAS GONE OVER THE HILL OF POISON SAID SHE
BY AND BYE I WAS BORN AND WAS BROUGHT UP BY MY GRANDFATHER IN ONE OF HIS GREAT HOUSES HERE ARE THE RINGS YOU GAVE TO MY MOTHER AND HERE IS THE CROSS AND THESE WILL PROVE IF I AM YOUR SON OR NOT
COME SAID DANGLARS WILL YOU TAKE A MILLION NO TWO MILLIONS THREE FOUR COME FOUR I WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU ON CONDITION THAT YOU LET ME GO
CREEPING SOFTLY TO THE DOOR HE PEEPED THROUGH IT AND BEHELD HER LYING QUIETLY WITH A CROWN OF GOLD AND PEARLS UPON HER HEAD HER WRINKLES ALL GONE AND HER FACE WHICH WAS WHITER THAN THE SNOW AS FRESH AS THAT OF A GIRL OF FOURTEEN
AND NO ONE ELSE WILL I HAVE AND AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE SPELLS FELL OFF HIM AND NEVER MORE WOULD HE BE A HOODIE HAPPY INDEED WERE THEY TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN AND LITTLE DID THEY MIND THAT THE HILL OF POISON TOOK LONG TO CROSS
WHY DO YOU OFFER ME FOUR MILLION FOR WHAT IS WORTH FIVE MILLION THIS IS A KIND OF USURY BANKER THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND TAKE ALL THEN TAKE ALL I TELL YOU AND KILL ME
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHY AFTER THAT A WOMAN BADE HER ENTER AND SET FOOD BEFORE HER AND GAVE HER A SOFT BED TO LIE IN AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE SHE GOT UP AND LEFT THE HOUSE IN SEARCH OF THE HOODIE
BUT WHEN SHE TURNED TO ANSWER YOU YOU WERE SO STRUCK WITH HER BEAUTY THAT ALL ELSE FLED FROM YOUR MIND AGAIN AND AGAIN YOU RODE BACK TO SEE HER AND AT LENGTH PERSUADED HER TO MARRY YOU SHE ONLY THOUGHT YOU A POOR KNIGHT AND AGREED THAT AS YOU WISHED IT
BENDING MY BACK AND WRINKLING MY SKIN TILL I LOOKED AS IF I WAS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND MAKING ME SUCH AN OBJECT OF DISGUST TO EVERYONE
