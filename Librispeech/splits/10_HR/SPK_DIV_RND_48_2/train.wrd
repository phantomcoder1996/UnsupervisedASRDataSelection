WITHOUT ASKING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND ALIGHTED COMMENDED THE HORSES TO THE CARE OF HIS LACKEY
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE JOURNEY OF ONE OF MY LADS TO PARIS
THE PROTESTANT RELIGION IMMEDIATELY PREVAILED IN HIS MIND HE LOWERED HIS GUN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAVELER THEN WHEN HE WAS WITHIN TEN PACES OF HIM HE COMMENCED A CONVERSATION WHICH ALMOST ALWAYS ENDED BY THE TRAVELER'S ABANDONING HIS PURSE TO SAVE HIS LIFE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING
D'ARTAGNAN WAS THEREFORE SERVED WITH MIRACULOUS CELERITY THE REGIMENT OF THE GUARDS WAS RECRUITED AMONG THE FIRST GENTLEMEN OF THE KINGDOM AND D'ARTAGNAN FOLLOWED BY A LACKEY AND TRAVELING WITH FOUR MAGNIFICENT HORSES
OUR HOST HAS A WELL FURNISHED CELLAR THE KEY OF WHICH NEVER LEAVES HIM ONLY THIS CELLAR HAS A VENTILATING HOLE NOW THROUGH THIS VENTILATING HOLE I THROW MY LASSO AND AS I NOW KNOW IN WHICH PART OF THE CELLAR IS THE BEST WINE THAT'S MY POINT FOR SPORT
PARDON MY DEAR MONSIEUR BONACIEUX IF I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY SAID D'ARTAGNAN BUT NOTHING MAKES ONE SO THIRSTY AS WANT OF SLEEP I AM PARCHED WITH THIRST
IT IS A WOUND THAT CONFINES HIM TO HIS BED AH AND A MASTER STROKE TOO I ASSURE YOU YOUR FRIEND'S SOUL MUST STICK TIGHT TO HIS BODY WERE YOU THERE THEN
BECAUSE SHE FLEW INTO A GREAT PASSION ON RECEIVING THE LETTER
AND WHAT HAS BECAME OF HIM OH I DON'T KNOW HE HAD ENOUGH AND SET OFF WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE REST BUT YOU MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU SO THAT THIS STRAIN OF THE KNEE CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN MY DEAR PORTHOS KEEPS YOU IN BED
WELL CAN I SEE PORTHOS CERTAINLY MONSIEUR TAKE THE STAIRS ON YOUR RIGHT GO UP THE FIRST FLIGHT AND KNOCK AT NUMBER ONE ONLY WARN HIM THAT IT IS YOU WHY SHOULD I DO THAT
NO I NEVER SAW HIM UNTIL THAT MOMENT AND HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE VERY WELL I KNOW ALL THAT I WISH TO KNOW PORTHOS'S CHAMBER IS YOU SAY ON THE FIRST STORY NUMBER ONE
D'ARTAGNAN GLANCED DOWN AT HIS BOOTS ALL COVERED WITH MUD BUT THAT SAME GLANCE FELL UPON THE SHOES AND STOCKINGS OF THE MERCER AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID THEY HAD BEEN DIPPED IN THE SAME MUD HEAP BOTH WERE STAINED WITH SPLASHES OF MUD OF THE SAME APPEARANCE
MONSIEUR I FOLLOWED THEM FROM CURIOSITY SO THAT I SAW THE COMBAT WITHOUT THE COMBATANTS SEEING ME AND WHAT TOOK PLACE OH THE AFFAIR WAS NOT LONG I ASSURE YOU THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON GUARD
THAT WHEN HE SAW A HUGUENOT COMING HE FELT HIMSELF FILLED WITH SUCH ARDENT CATHOLIC ZEAL
HE ADOPTED A MIXED BELIEF WHICH PERMITTED HIM TO BE SOMETIMES CATHOLIC SOMETIMES A HUGUENOT
I CANNOT TELL YOU MONSIEUR WHAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME SURELY YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PERSON YES BUT IN OUR SITUATION WE MUST NOT SAY ALL WE KNOW PARTICULARLY AS WE HAVE BEEN WARNED THAT OUR EARS SHOULD ANSWER FOR OUR TONGUES
D'ARTAGNAN REMARKED SOMETHING PERFIDIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE PLAY OF THE WRINKLED FEATURES OF HIS COUNTENANCE A ROGUE DOES NOT LAUGH IN THE SAME WAY THAT AN HONEST MAN DOES A HYPOCRITE DOES NOT SHED THE TEARS OF A MAN OF GOOD FAITH
MY GOD THAT'S ALL I SHALL BE ABOUT AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS WHY DID YOU NOT HAVE YOURSELF CONVEYED TO PARIS YOU MUST BE CRUELLY BORED HERE THAT WAS MY INTENTION BUT MY DEAR FRIEND I HAVE ONE THING TO CONFESS TO YOU WHAT'S THAT
THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL ARABIAN CUSTOM WHICH MAKES ETERNAL FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE TOGETHER EATEN BREAD AND SALT UNDER THE SAME ROOF I KNOW IT MADAME REPLIED THE COUNT BUT WE ARE IN FRANCE AND NOT IN ARABIA
AND WHO BOTH KNEW HIM AGAIN SO THEY UNITED AGAINST HIM AND HANGED HIM ON A TREE
ALLOW ME TO TAKE A GLASS OF WATER IN YOUR APARTMENT YOU KNOW THAT IS NEVER REFUSED AMONG NEIGHBORS WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE PERMISSION OF HIS HOST D'ARTAGNAN WENT QUICKLY INTO THE HOUSE AND CAST A RAPID GLANCE AT THE BED IT HAD NOT BEEN USED
HE FURNISHES IT IT IS TRUE BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS THAT HONOR EXPLAIN YOURSELF MOUSQUETON YOUR CONVERSATION IS FULL OF INSTRUCTIVE THINGS THAT IS IT MONSIEUR
NO ONE CAN REPROACH YOU FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND MONSIEUR BONACIEUX SAID THE YOUNG MAN YOU ARE A MODEL FOR REGULAR PEOPLE IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN A MAN POSSESSES A YOUNG AND PRETTY WIFE HE HAS NO NEED TO SEEK HAPPINESS ELSEWHERE
WELL HE COMES TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER WHY SO
I HAVE SUFFERED DEEPLY MADAME ANSWERED MONTE CRISTO BUT NOW YOU ARE HAPPY DOUBTLESS REPLIED THE COUNT SINCE NO ONE HEARS ME COMPLAIN AND YOUR PRESENT HAPPINESS HAS IT SOFTENED YOUR HEART
DRESSED WITH A DOZEN YOUNG AND TENDER SPRING CHICKENS AFTER THE HARE HE ORDERED SOME PARTRIDGES A FEW PHEASANTS A COUPLE OF RABBITS AND A DOZEN FROGS AND LIZARDS THAT WAS ALL HE FELT ILL HE SAID AND COULD NOT EAT ANOTHER BITE
WHO ALTHOUGH SHE IS AT LEAST FIFTY STILL GIVES HERSELF JEALOUS AIRS
AND YET SAID D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING IT APPEARS TO ME THAT FROM TIME TO TIME YOU MUST MAKE SORTIES AND HE AGAIN POINTED TO THE BOTTLES AND THE STEWPANS NOT I UNFORTUNATELY SAID PORTHOS THIS MISERABLE STRAIN CONFINES ME TO MY BED
AS HE WAS SO IN NEED OF STRENGTH HE HAD TO HAVE FOUR MORE HELPINGS OF BUTTER AND CHEESE THE FOX AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF COAXING TRIED HIS BEST TO EAT A LITTLE THE DOCTOR HAD PUT HIM ON A DIET AND HE HAD TO BE SATISFIED WITH A SMALL HARE
I PUT MY FOOT ON A STONE SLIPPED AND STRAINED MY KNEE TRULY HONOR
I WILL SEE THE QUEEN I WILL RELATE TO HER THE DETAILS OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS POOR WOMAN OF WHICH SHE IS NO DOUBT IGNORANT THESE DETAILS WILL GUIDE HER ON HER PART AND ON YOUR RETURN I SHALL PERHAPS HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TO TELL YOU RELY ON ME
YOU SAID THAT PORTHOS HAD RECEIVED A SWORD CUT YES BUT HE HAS FORBIDDEN ME SO STRICTLY TO SAY SO AND WHY SO ZOUNDS MONSIEUR BECAUSE HE HAD BOASTED THAT HE WOULD PERFORATE THE STRANGER WITH WHOM YOU LEFT HIM IN DISPUTE
AND I ON THAT OF THE HUGUENOT TWO HOURS AFTER ALL WAS OVER WE HAD DONE THE BUSINESS OF BOTH ADMIRING THE FORESIGHT OF OUR POOR FATHER WHO HAD TAKEN THE PRECAUTION TO BRING EACH OF US UP IN A DIFFERENT RELIGION WELL
WHILE A SPIT LOADED WITH PARTRIDGES WAS TURNING BEFORE THE FIRE AND ON EACH SIDE OF A LARGE CHIMNEYPIECE OVER TWO CHAFING DISHES WERE BOILING TWO STEWPANS FROM WHICH EXHALED A DOUBLE ODOR OF RABBIT AND FISH STEWS
HE FOUND PLANCHET IN A GREAT FRIGHT AH MONSIEUR
AND WHAT WAS THE END OF THIS WORTHY MAN ASKED D'ARTAGNAN OH OF THE MOST UNFORTUNATE KIND MONSIEUR ONE DAY HE WAS SURPRISED IN A LONELY ROAD BETWEEN A HUGUENOT AND A CATHOLIC WITH BOTH OF WHOM HE HAD BEFORE HAD BUSINESS
THE FALSEHOOD WOULD THEN LIE AT MY DOOR AND AS I AM NOT A GENTLEMAN I MAY BE ALLOWED TO LIE
PINOCCHIO PAID A GOLD PIECE FOR THE THREE SUPPERS AND STARTED ON HIS WAY TOWARD THE FIELD THAT WAS TO MAKE HIM A RICH MAN HE WALKED ON NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS GOING FOR IT WAS DARK SO DARK THAT NOT A THING WAS VISIBLE
THEY REACHED THE BUILDING ORNAMENTED WITH MAGNIFICENT FRUITS WHICH RIPEN AT THE BEGINNING OF JULY IN THE ARTIFICIAL TEMPERATURE WHICH TAKES THE PLACE OF THE SUN SO FREQUENTLY ABSENT IN OUR CLIMATE THE COUNTESS LEFT THE ARM OF MONTE CRISTO
MY PRESENT HAPPINESS EQUALS MY PAST MISERY SAID THE COUNT ARE YOU NOT MARRIED ASKED THE COUNTESS I MARRIED EXCLAIMED MONTE CRISTO SHUDDERING
AND THAT SHE WAS SURE IT WAS FOR SOME WOMAN HE HAD RECEIVED THIS WOUND HAS HE BEEN WOUNDED THEN OH GOOD LORD
MONTE CRISTO REMAINED AS UNMOVED AS IF THE REPROACH HAD NOT BEEN ADDRESSED TO HIM ALBERT AT THIS MOMENT RAN IN OH MOTHER HE EXCLAIMED SUCH A MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED WHAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED ASKED THE COUNTESS
THEY WENT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE GARDEN WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD SIR SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED THE COUNTESS AFTER THEIR WALK HAD CONTINUED TEN MINUTES IN SILENCE IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE SEEN SO MUCH TRAVELLED SO FAR AND SUFFERED SO DEEPLY
THE HOST ON SEEING A YOUNG MAN FOLLOWED BY A LACKEY WITH TWO EXTRA HORSES ADVANCED RESPECTFULLY TO THE DOOR NOW AS THEY HAD ALREADY TRAVELED ELEVEN LEAGUES D'ARTAGNAN THOUGHT IT TIME TO STOP
THIS PROBABILITY AFFORDED HIM HIS FIRST CONSOLATION IF BONACIEUX KNEW WHERE HIS WIFE WAS ONE MIGHT BY EXTREME MEANS FORCE THE MERCER TO OPEN HIS TEETH AND LET HIS SECRET ESCAPE
BUT YOU ARE HERE MY DEAR FELLOW LET US SPEAK OF YOU I CONFESS I BEGAN TO BE VERY UNEASY ON YOUR ACCOUNT BUT YOUR HOST BEHAVES VERY WELL TOWARD YOU AS IT APPEARS MY DEAR PORTHOS
SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE LET THEM TELL THEIR STORY OUT REPLIED MOUSQUETON THEN AS IN LEAVING THE CABARET THEY TOOK DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
ALL FALSEHOOD IS A MASK AND HOWEVER WELL MADE THE MASK MAY BE WITH A LITTLE ATTENTION WE MAY ALWAYS SUCCEED IN DISTINGUISHING IT FROM THE TRUE FACE
SHE EXCLAIMED IN SO PLAINTIVE AN ACCENT THAT IT SEEMED TO STIFLE A SOB REALLY YOU PAIN ME A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED THE PEACH LIKE THE GRAPES FELL TO THE GROUND COUNT ADDED MERCEDES WITH A SUPPLICATING GLANCE
I HATE THEM NOT AT ALL WHY SHOULD I THE COUNTESS PLACED HERSELF BEFORE MONTE CRISTO STILL HOLDING IN HER HAND A PORTION OF THE PERFUMED GRAPES TAKE SOME SHE SAID
AND IN FRANCE ETERNAL FRIENDSHIPS ARE AS RARE AS THE CUSTOM OF DIVIDING BREAD AND SALT WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT SAID THE COUNTESS BREATHLESSLY WITH HER EYES FIXED ON MONTE CRISTO WHOSE ARM SHE CONVULSIVELY PRESSED WITH BOTH HANDS WE ARE FRIENDS ARE WE NOT
PINOCCHIO ATE LEAST OF ALL HE ASKED FOR A BITE OF BREAD AND A FEW NUTS AND THEN HARDLY TOUCHED THEM THE POOR FELLOW WITH HIS MIND ON THE FIELD OF WONDERS WAS SUFFERING FROM A GOLD PIECE INDIGESTION
HE ASSISTED HIM TO RISE BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE HOTEL MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND DISAPPEARED SO IT WAS WITH MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN THIS STRANGER MEANT TO QUARREL IT APPEARS SO
THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO HAVE ANY DOUBTS UPON THE SUPERIORITY OF OUR HOLY RELIGION FOR MY PART MONSIEUR I AM CATHOLIC MY FATHER FAITHFUL TO HIS PRINCIPLES HAVING MADE MY ELDER BROTHER A HUGUENOT
THEN A SUDDEN IDEA CROSSED THE MIND OF D'ARTAGNAN THAT LITTLE STOUT MAN SHORT AND ELDERLY THAT SORT OF LACKEY DRESSED IN DARK CLOTHES TREATED WITHOUT CEREMONY BY THE MEN WEARING SWORDS WHO COMPOSED THE ESCORT
I MUST ALLOW AS YOU SAY YOUR FATHER WAS A VERY INTELLIGENT FELLOW AND YOU SAY IN HIS LEISURE MOMENTS THE WORTHY MAN WAS A POACHER YES MONSIEUR AND IT WAS HE WHO TAUGHT ME TO LAY A SNARE AND GROUND A LINE THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WHEN I SAW OUR LABORERS
HE ACCEPTED MY CHALLENGE AND MY FAITH MY SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES PASSED FROM MY POCKET TO HIS WITHOUT RECKONING MY HORSE WHICH HE WON INTO THE BARGAIN BUT YOU MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT MY DEAR PORTHOS
YOU MUST GIVE YOUR RECIPE TO PLANCHET I MAY BE BESIEGED IN MY TURN AND I SHALL NOT BE SORRY FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO LET ME ENJOY THE SAME ADVANTAGES WITH WHICH YOU GRATIFY YOUR MASTER LORD MONSIEUR THERE IS NOTHING MORE EASY SAID MOUSQUETON WITH A MODEST AIR
DON'T BE AFRAID HE IS NOT SO MUCH OF A DEVIL AS HE APPEARS
BUT MOUSQUETON FORAGES AND BRINGS IN PROVISIONS FRIEND MOUSQUETON YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE A REINFORCEMENT AND WE MUST HAVE AN INCREASE OF SUPPLIES MOUSQUETON SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOU MUST RENDER ME A SERVICE WHAT MONSIEUR
THE PLACE NAMED BY BONACIEUX AS THAT WHICH HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF HIS JOURNEY WAS A FRESH PROOF IN SUPPORT OF THE SUSPICIONS D'ARTAGNAN HAD CONCEIVED
AH BUT YOU ARE JOKING MY WORTHY MAN SAID D'ARTAGNAN IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IF MY BOOTS NEED A SPONGE YOUR STOCKINGS AND SHOES STAND IN EQUAL NEED OF A BRUSH MAY YOU NOT HAVE BEEN PHILANDERING A LITTLE ALSO MONSIEUR BONACIEUX
BUT WHAT SHALL WE DRINK TO SO AS TO AVOID WOUNDING ANY SUSCEPTIBILITY LET US DRINK TO THE PROSPERITY OF YOUR ESTABLISHMENT
THE HOUR IS LATE I WANT TO GO ON THE NIGHT IS VERY DARK I WANT TO GO ON THE ROAD IS DANGEROUS I WANT TO GO ON
YOUR LORDSHIP DOES ME MUCH HONOR SAID THE HOST AND I THANK YOU SINCERELY FOR YOUR KIND WISH BUT DON'T MISTAKE SAID D'ARTAGNAN THERE IS MORE SELFISHNESS IN MY TOAST THAN PERHAPS YOU MAY THINK
THE COUNT LOOKED AT MERCEDES AS IF TO INTERROGATE HER BUT SHE CONTINUED TO WALK ON IN SILENCE AND HE REFRAINED FROM SPEAKING
WHO HAS BEEN HERE COME SPEAK MONSIEUR DE CAVOIS
WELL YOU SEE MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN WITH WHAT ILL LUCK I PLAY REPLIED PORTHOS WITH THE MOST CARELESS AIR IN THE WORLD I WROTE TO HER TO SEND ME FIFTY LOUIS OR SO
BUT STEPPED BACK DO YOU REFUSE SAID MERCEDES IN A TREMULOUS VOICE PRAY EXCUSE ME MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BUT I NEVER EAT MUSCATEL GRAPES MERCEDES LET THEM FALL AND SIGHED
ANSWERED THE LITTLE BEING IN A FAINT VOICE THAT SOUNDED AS IF IT CAME FROM A FAR AWAY WORLD WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE MARIONETTE I WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW WORDS OF GOOD ADVICE
PORTHOS SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FREELY AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU MY DEAR PORTHOS CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN WHY ON MAKING A THRUST AT MY ADVERSARY WHOM I HAD ALREADY HIT THREE TIMES AND WHOM I MEANT TO FINISH WITH THE FOURTH
A BOY GOES UP TO THAT INSTITUTION GETS HIS PASS AND RETURNS TO CIVIL LIFE SO THEY TELL ME WITH A DANGEROUS KNOWLEDGE THAT HE IS A SUCKLING VON MOLTKE AND MAY APPLY HIS LEARNING WHEN OCCASION OFFERS GIVEN TROUBLE THAT MAN WILL BE A NUISANCE
STRUCK HIM A VIOLENT BLOW ON THE NOSE WITH A TEASPOON THEN HE TURNED TO ME VERY PALE AND SAID PAULINE THIS MUST END THE TIME HAS COME TO SPEAK UP A NERVOUS HIGHLY STRUNG MAN LIKE MYSELF SHOULD NOT AND MUST NOT BE CALLED UPON TO LIVE IN A HOUSE
OF COURSE IT'S THE TITLE THAT DOES IT LADY PAULINE WETHERBY ALGIE SAYS IT OUGHTN'T TO BE THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT THE DAUGHTER OF A DUKE
FOR THE LAST PERSON ROSCOE SHERRIFF HANDLED AN EMOTIONAL ACTRESS NAMED DEVENISH HAD TO KEEP A YOUNG PUMA BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE END OF IT WAS THAT HE RANG OFF
AND THE DEAR PEOPLE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO WITH IT
MILK THE QUICKEST YOU CAN GET ME
AND WE'LL SCARE UP SOME BREAKFAST STEVE'S IGNORANCE OF THE LOCALITY IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF WAS COMPLETE BUT HE HAD A GENERAL IMPRESSION THAT FARMERS AS A CLASS WERE PEOPLE WHO DELIGHTED IN PROVIDING BREAKFASTS FOR THE NEEDY IF THE NEEDY POSSESSED THE NECESSARY PRICE
CONFIDED TO ME THAT SHE HATED THE IDEA OF SALT LAKE CITY BEING TURNED INTO A SHOW PLACE FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE GENTILES
AND IN THE TABERNACLE ON A SUNDAY THE PREACHERS FOLLOW SUIT WHEN I WENT THERE
HIS NAME'S JIM FINE
THE SWEDES THEY THINK IT HIS I KNOW IT HISN'T BUT YOU'VE GOT YOUR LAND ALL RIGHT OH YES WE'VE GOT OUR LAND AN WE NEVER SAY AUGHT AGAINST POLYGAMY O COURSE
DARLING CLAIRE DO COME OR I KNOW I SHALL WEAKEN AND YIELD TO ALGIE'S OUTRAGEOUS DEMANDS FOR
THE BOND BETWEEN THE STATES IS OF AN AMAZING TENUITY SO LONG AS THEY DO NOT ABSOLUTELY MARCH INTO THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SIT ON THE WASHINGTON STATUES AND INVENT A FLAG OF THEIR OWN
SEEMED SUDDENLY LESS ATTRACTIVE BED WAS WHAT HE WANTED NOW NOT NATURE
AND HOW I PRESERVE MY BEAUTY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING WELL ONE THING HE MADE ME DO WAS TO BUY A SNAKE AND A MONKEY ROSCOE SHERRIFF IS CRAZY ABOUT ANIMALS AS AIDS TO ADVERTISEMENT HE SAYS AN ANIMAL STORY IS THE THING HE DOES BEST SO I BOUGHT THEM
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT ALGIE WALKED STRAIGHT OUT OF THE HOUSE STILL HOLDING THE TEASPOON AND HAS NOT RETURNED LATER IN THE DAY HE CALLED ME UP ON THE PHONE AND SAID THAT
WILLIAM BANNISTER MADE NO MORE OBJECTIONS HE ATTACKED HIS MEAL WITH AN EASY CONSCIENCE
HE KNEADED THE RECUMBENT FORM OF HIS GODSON WITH A LARGE HAND UNTIL HE HAD MASSAGED OUT OF HIM THE LAST REMAINS OF HIS GREAT SLEEP IT TOOK SOME TIME BUT IT WAS EFFECTIVE THE WHITE HOPE SAT UP FULL OF LIFE AND ENERGY
HE'S A BAD BOY WELL
THEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER HOTEL TO WRITE A LETTER HOME NOTIFYING HER MOTHER OF HER PLANS SHE LOOKED AT HER WATCH IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK BACK IN WEST KENSINGTON A RICH SMELL OF DINNER WOULD BE FLOATING THROUGH THE FLAT THE COOK
HAS THE CUTEST WAY OF CLIMBING UP THE LEG OF THE TABLE
AS IF HE WERE A SUPERIOR BEING OF SOME KIND GOVERNED BY CODES WHICH SHE COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO UNDERSTAND
BY GREAT GOOD LUCK THE EVIL MINDED TRAIN ALREADY DELAYED TWELVE HOURS BY A BURNED BRIDGE BROUGHT ME TO THE CITY ON A SATURDAY
HE INSPECTED STEVE GRAVELY FOR A MOMENT ENDEAVOURING TO PLACE HIM HELLO STEVE HE SAID AT LENGTH HELLO KID WHERE AM I IN THE COUNTRY IN CONNECTICUT WHAT'S NECTICUT
HE WENT ON QUICKLY AS HIS GODSON OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK
FROM WHICH THE STOPPING OF THE CAR DID NOT AWAKEN HIM STEVE JUMPED DOWN AND STRETCHED HIMSELF THERE WAS A WONDERFUL FRESHNESS IN THE AIR WHICH MADE HIM FORGET FOR A MOMENT HIS DESIRE FOR REPOSE HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM BREATHING DEEP DRAUGHTS OF ITS COOLNESS
IT WAS A LONG LETTER TOO LONG TO BE READ UNTIL SHE WAS AT LEISURE AND WRITTEN IN A STRAGGLING HAND THAT MADE READING DIFFICULT SHE WAS MILDLY SURPRISED THAT POLLY SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN HER FOR SHE HAD BEEN BACK IN AMERICA A YEAR OR MORE NOW
IN HIS HEART HE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE COULD NEVER BE HAPPY FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING OF BROADWAY CARS BUT AT THAT MOMENT SUCH WAS THE MAGIC OF THE DAWN HE FELT A LONGING TO SETTLE DOWN IN THE COUNTRY AND PASS THE REST OF HIS DAYS A SIMPLE FARMER
THEN I WENT ABOUT THE STREETS AND PEEPED INTO PEOPLE'S FRONT WINDOWS AND THE DECORATIONS UPON THE TABLES WERE AFTER THE MANNER OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FIFTY MAIN STREET WAS FULL OF COUNTRY FOLK FROM THE DESERT
THEY FEED YOU ROLLS AT HOME WRAPPED UP IN TISSUE PAPER IS THAT IT WHAT'S TISSUE SAME AS CRINKLY WELL SEE HERE YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE WAS TALKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT ABOUT GERMS YES WELL
WOULD BE CAPABLE OF HEAVING A SHOVELFUL OF MUD INTO THE ATLANTIC IN THE HOPE OF FILLING IT UP CONSEQUENTLY THE AUTHORITIES ARE FASCINATED WITH THE IDEA OF THE SLIDING SCALE OR CONCERTINA ARMY THIS IS AN HEREDITARY INSTINCT FOR YOU KNOW THAT WHEN WE ENGLISH HAVE GOT TOGETHER TWO COMPANIES ONE MACHINE GUN A SICK BULLOCK
I'VE GOT THINGS O MY OWN AND SOME LAND BUT I SUPPOSE YOU WILL NOT ME
BUT FOR THE CERTAINTY THAT UGLY PERSONS ARE JUST AS IRRATIONAL IN THE MATTER OF UNDIVIDED LOVE AS THE BEAUTIFUL IT SEEMS THAT POLYGAMY WAS A BLESSED INSTITUTION FOR THE WOMEN AND THAT ONLY THE DREAD THREATS OF THE SPIRITUAL POWER
HIT THE HAY THERE WAS THE WHITE HOPE'S BED TO BE MADE AND BY THE WAY OF A PRELIMINARY TO THAT SHEETS MUST BE FOUND AND BLANKETS
FLAT AS A TABLE AGAINST THE FLANKS OF THE RINGING HILLS MARKS WHERE THE SALT LAKE RESTED FOR AWHILE IN ITS COLLAPSE
MEN ENGAGED IN A CONFLICT WITH POLICE OR JAILS
THE SUN WAS HIGH WHEN STEVE WOKE HE ROSE STIFFLY AND WENT INTO THE OTHER ROOM WILLIAM BANNISTER STILL SLEPT STEVE REGARDED HIM ADMIRINGLY FOR THE DORMOUSE ACT HE MUSED
OR THE SHINING LEVELS OF THE SALT LAKE HAD BEEN REACHED THAT MAYOR HIMSELF A GENTILE AND ONE RENOWNED FOR HIS DEALINGS WITH THE MORMONS TOLD ME THAT THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE POWER WITHIN THE POWER
COME IN TO TRADE WITH THE ZION MERCANTILE CO OPERATIVE INSTITUTE THE CHURCH I FANCY LOOKS AFTER THE FINANCES OF THIS THING AND IT CONSEQUENTLY PAYS GOOD DIVIDENDS THE FACES OF THE WOMEN WERE NOT LOVELY IN DEED
BUT TO DAY SO FAR FROM KILLING OPENLY OR SECRETLY OR BURNING GENTILE FARMS IT IS ALL THE MORMON DARE DO TO FEEBLY TRY TO BOYCOTT THE INTERLOPER
COULD DRIVE THE HULKING BOARD FACED MEN INTO IT THE WOMEN WORE HIDEOUS GARMENTS AND THE MEN APPEARED TO BE TIED UP WITH STRINGS
I'M GOING TO HURRY SAID CLAIRE CLENCHING HER FISTS AS TWO SIMULTANEOUS BURSTS OF SONG IN DIFFERENT KEYS AND VARYING TEMPOS
BUT HIS FATHER USED TO BE A LOW PRIZE FIGHTER AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE STEVE NODDED SYMPATHETICALLY
WITH A DEEP SIGH OF REPLETION STEVE MEANWHILE HAD ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SAY
THE IMMORTAL WRECK OF THE GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC IS A POLITICAL POWER OF THE LARGEST AND MOST UNBLUSHING DESCRIPTION IT OUGHT NOT TO HELP TO LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF AN AMATEUR MILITARY POWER THAT IS BLIND AND IRRESPONSIBLE
THAT KID CERTAINLY STANDS ALONE YOU GOT TO HAND IT TO HIM
BECAUSE HE IS A HIDEOUSLY VERSATILE AMERICAN TO BEGIN WITH
SHE MEANT TO GET HER PACKING DONE IN RECORD TIME AND ESCAPE FROM THIS PLACE SHE WENT INTO HER BEDROOM AND BEGAN TO THROW THINGS UNTIDILY INTO HER TRUNK
AND WENT SO BIG THAT MY AGENT SHIFTED ME TO THE RESTAURANTS AND THEY HAVE TO CALL OUT THE POLICE RESERVES TO HANDLE THE CROWD YOU CAN'T GET A TABLE AT REIGELHEIMER'S WHICH IS MY PITCH
AND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS GROWING LESS ARDUOUS YEAR BY YEAR B INTERNAL RIOTS AND COMMOTIONS WHICH RISE UP LIKE A DUST DEVIL WHIRL FURIOUSLY AND DIE OUT LONG BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES AT WASHINGTON COULD BEGIN TO FILL UP EVEN THE THIRD SKELETON BATTALIONS
THEY LIVE IN THE COTTAGE BY THE BIG HOUSE YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THEM TREES HIS POP LOOKS AFTER MISTER WILSON'S PRIZE DAWGS THAT'S HIS JOB WHAT'S WILSON ASKED THE WHITE HOPE COMING OUT OF HIS STUPOR
I'M DOING BAREFOOT DANCING
THOUGH ONE COULD BE CERTAIN THAT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING INVOLVING A DEAFENING NOISE CLAIRE
YOU HAVE A FIRST CLASS ENGINE FOR PIONEER WORK THE TAWDRY MYSTICISM AND THE BORROWING FROM FREEMASONRY SERVE THE LOW CASTE SWEDE AND DANE THE WELSHMAN AND THE CORNISH COTTER JUST AS WELL AS A HIGHLY ORGANIZED HEAVEN
AND NOW IT'S PICTURES I DON'T MIND HIS PAINTING IT GIVES HIM SOMETHING TO DO AND KEEPS HIM OUT OF MISCHIEF HE HAS A STUDIO DOWN IN WASHINGTON SQUARE AND IS PERFECTLY HAPPY MESSING ABOUT THERE ALL DAY EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE IF HE DIDN'T THINK IT NECESSARY
WATCHING THE BOILING CABBAGE WOULD BE SINGING A FEW MORE YEARS SHALL ROLL HER MOTHER WOULD BE SIGHING AND HER LITTLE BROTHER PERCY WOULD BE EMPLOYED UPON SOME
OF ALL THE THINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE CHIMED IN WITH HER DISCONTENTED MOOD AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN FLIGHT TO AMERICA WAS THE MOST ALLURING ONLY ONE CONSIDERATION HELD HER BACK SHE HAD NOT THE MONEY FOR HER FARE
I SAY CLAIRE IT'S GOT AN AMERICAN STAMP ON IT CAN I HAVE IT CLAIRE I HAVEN'T GOT ONE IN MY COLLECTION HIS SISTER REGARDED HIM BROODINGLY FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T BELLOW LIKE THAT SHE SAID OF COURSE YOU CAN HAVE THE STAMP I DON'T WANT IT
THE DROPPED H BETRAYED HER AND WHEN DID YOU LEAVE ENGLAND I SAID SUMMER OF EIGHTY FOUR
AND TALKING ABOUT A LADY WETHERBY TEN MINUTES LATER HER PASSAGE SECURED CLAIRE WAS WALKING TO THE LOCAL THEATRE TO INFORM THOSE IN CHARGE OF THE DESTINIES OF THE GIRL AND THE ARTIST NUMBER ONE COMPANY THAT THEY MUST LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR A SUBSTITUTE FOR MISS CLAUDIA WINSLOW
POLLY DAVIS NOW MARRIED FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE TO THAT CURIOUS INVERTEBRATE PERSON ALGIE WETHERBY WAS THE ONLY REAL FRIEND CLAIRE HAD MADE ON THE STAGE A SORT OF SHIVERING GENTILITY
THE ROBINS WHICH THOUGH NOT SO WELL ADVERTISED RISE JUST AS PUNCTUALLY AS THE LARK WERE BEGINNING TO SING AS THEY MADE THEIR SIMPLE TOILETS BEFORE SETTING OUT TO ATTEND TO THE EARLY WORM
JIM SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD TO ME ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS THIS ONE FOR THE LORD'S SAKE
THE OMNIBUS ROLLED ON TOWARDS WEST KENSINGTON CLAIRE HATED THE PLACE WITH THE BITTER HATE OF ONE WHO HAD READ SOCIETY NOVELS AND YEARNED FOR GROSVENOR SQUARE AND BUTLERS AND A GENERAL ATMOSPHERE OF SOFT CUSHIONS AND PINK SHADED LIGHTS
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE WHERE ARE WE HERE IN CONNECTICUT WHY STEVE RAISED A PROTESTING HAND NOT SO EARLY IN THE DAY KID NOT BEFORE BREAKFAST HE PLEADED HONEST I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH
THE AUTOMOBILE THE CAR THE CHUG CHUG WAGON THE THING WE CAME HERE IN
IT AIN'T AS IF WE WAS A VAUDEVILLE TEAM THAT HAD GOT TO REHEARSE WHAT'S REHEARSE STEVE CHANGED THE SUBJECT SAY KID AIN'T YOU FEELING LIKE YOU COULD BITE INTO SOMETHING
AND FOUND HIM EYEING A BOWL OF BREAD AND MILK IN A SORT OF FROZEN HORROR
THE SKY TO THE EAST WAS A DELICATE BLEND OF PINKS AND GREENS AND YELLOWS WITH A HINT OF BLUE BEHIND THE GREY WHICH WAS STILL THE PREVAILING NOTE A VAGUELY SENTIMENTAL MOOD CAME UPON STEVE
UNLESS YOU TIP THE HEAD WAITER A SMALL FORTUNE AND PROMISE TO MAIL HIM YOUR CLOTHES WHEN YOU GET HOME I DANCE DURING SUPPER WITH NOTHING ON MY FEET AND NOT MUCH ANYWHERE ELSE AND IT TAKES THREE VANS TO CARRY MY SALARY TO THE BANK
THIRD BATTALION SKELETON FOURTH ON PAPER EIGHT REGIMENTS CAVALRY AT FOUR BATTALIONS FOUR TROOPS EACH THIRD BATTALION SKELETON FOURTH ON PAPER FIVE REGIMENTS ARTILLERY AT FOUR BATTALIONS FOUR COMPANIES EACH THIRD BATTALION SKELETON FOURTH ON PAPER
YAWNING WEARILY HE SET OUT ON HIS SEARCH HE FOUND SHEETS BUT MISTRUSTED THEM THEY MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE PERFECTLY DRY HE DID NOT CARE TO RISK HIS GODSON'S VALUABLE HEALTH IN THE EXPERIMENT
AND MAIDS TO DO ONE'S HAIR SHE HATED THE CHEAP FURNITURE OF THE LITTLE PARLOUR THE PENETRATING CONTRALTO OF THE COOK SINGING HYMNS IN THE KITCHEN AND THE UBIQUITOUSNESS OF HER SMALL BROTHER HE WAS ONLY TEN AND SMALL FOR HIS AGE
HE CLIMBED IN AND UNLOCKED THE FRONT DOOR THEN HE CARRIED HIS YOUNG CHARGE INTO THE SITTING ROOM AND LAID HIM DOWN ON A CHAIR
ALGIE KICKED FROM THE FIRST I OUGHT TO TELL YOU THAT SINCE WE LEFT ENGLAND
IT'S ONE WAY OF FIXING EM WHAT'S FIXING INQUIRED WILLIAM BANNISTER BRIGHTLY STEVE SIGHED WHEN HE SPOKE HE WAS CALM BUT DETERMINED THAT'LL BE ALL THE DIALOGUE FOR THE PRESENT HE SAID WE'LL PLAY THE REST OF OUR ACT IN DUMB SHOW GET A MOVE ON YOU
POLLY MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SHE REFLECTED BITTERLY SHE TOOK THE LETTER UP AGAIN AND SAW THAT ON THE LAST PAGE THERE WAS A POSTSCRIPT P S I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU ARE FIXED FOR MONEY OLD GIRL
FORTY GENERALS AND A MASS OF W O FORMS WE SAY WE POSSESS AN ARMY CORPS CAPABLE OF INDEFINITE EXTENSION THE AMERICAN ARMY IS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ARMY SOME DAY WHEN ALL THE INDIANS ARE HAPPILY DEAD OR DRUNK
ROUND SHOULDERS HAD JO BIG HANDS AND FEET A FLYAWAY LOOK TO HER CLOTHES AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE APPEARANCE OF A GIRL WHO WAS RAPIDLY SHOOTING UP INTO A WOMAN AND DIDN'T LIKE IT ELIZABETH OR BETH AS EVERYONE CALLED HER
GLAD TO FIND YOU SO MERRY MY GIRLS SAID A CHEERY VOICE AT THE DOOR AND ACTORS AND AUDIENCE TURNED TO WELCOME A TALL MOTHERLY LADY WITH A CAN I HELP YOU LOOK ABOUT HER WHICH WAS TRULY DELIGHTFUL
IT WAS A COMFORTABLE ROOM THOUGH THE CARPET WAS FADED AND THE FURNITURE VERY PLAIN FOR A GOOD PICTURE OR TWO HUNG ON THE WALLS BOOKS FILLED THE RECESSES CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND CHRISTMAS ROSES BLOOMED IN THE WINDOWS AND A PLEASANT ATMOSPHERE OF HOME PEACE PERVADED IT
NEVER HAVING KNOWN MOTHER OR SISTERS HE WAS QUICK TO FEEL THE INFLUENCES THEY BROUGHT ABOUT HIM AND THEIR BUSY LIVELY WAYS MADE HIM ASHAMED OF THE INDOLENT LIFE HE LED
HOW BLITHELY SHE SANG THAT EVENING AND HOW THEY ALL LAUGHED AT HER BECAUSE SHE WOKE AMY IN THE NIGHT BY PLAYING THE PIANO ON HER FACE IN HER SLEEP
BUT I DON'T THINK THE LITTLE WE SHOULD SPEND WOULD DO ANY GOOD WE'VE EACH GOT A DOLLAR AND THE ARMY WOULDN'T BE MUCH HELPED BY OUR GIVING THAT
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO AND THANK HIM SAID JO BY WAY OF A JOKE FOR THE IDEA OF THE CHILD'S REALLY GOING NEVER ENTERED HER HEAD
SIGHED AMY WHEN WILL HE COME HOME MARMEE ASKED BETH WITH A LITTLE QUIVER IN HER VOICE NOT FOR MANY MONTHS DEAR UNLESS HE IS SICK
BETH ATE NO MORE BUT CREPT AWAY TO SIT IN HER SHADOWY CORNER AND BROOD OVER THE DELIGHT TO COME TILL THE OTHERS WERE READY I THINK IT WAS SO SPLENDID IN FATHER TO GO AS CHAPLAIN WHEN HE WAS TOO OLD TO BE DRAFTED AND NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR A SOLDIER SAID MEG WARMLY
SHE STAYED TILL HANNAH CAME TO TAKE HER HOME TO DINNER BUT SHE HAD NO APPETITE AND COULD ONLY SIT AND SMILE UPON EVERYONE IN A GENERAL STATE OF BEATITUDE
NOT IN PLAY BUT IN EARNEST AND SEE HOW FAR ON YOU CAN GET BEFORE FATHER COMES HOME REALLY MOTHER WHERE ARE OUR BUNDLES ASKED AMY WHO WAS A VERY LITERAL YOUNG LADY EACH OF YOU TOLD WHAT YOUR BURDEN WAS JUST NOW EXCEPT BETH
BEFORE MISSUS MARCH COULD REPLY MISTER LAURENCE WENT ON WITH AN ODD LITTLE NOD AND SMILE THEY NEEDN'T SEE OR SPEAK TO ANYONE BUT RUN IN AT ANY TIME FOR I'M SHUT UP IN MY STUDY AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE LAURIE IS OUT A GREAT DEAL
SHE WAS NOT ELEGANTLY DRESSED BUT A NOBLE LOOKING WOMAN AND THE GIRLS THOUGHT THE GRAY CLOAK AND UNFASHIONABLE BONNET COVERED THE MOST SPLENDID MOTHER IN THE WORLD WELL DEARIES HOW HAVE YOU GOT ON TODAY
WOULDN'T SOME OF YOUR GIRLS LIKE TO RUN OVER AND PRACTICE ON IT NOW AND THEN JUST TO KEEP IT IN TUNE YOU KNOW MA'AM BETH TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND PRESSED HER HANDS TIGHTLY TOGETHER TO KEEP FROM CLAPPING THEM FOR THIS WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE TEMPTATION AND THE THOUGHT OF PRACTICING ON THAT SPLENDID INSTRUMENT QUITE TOOK HER BREATH AWAY
SAID JO MARCHING UP AND DOWN WITH HER HANDS BEHIND HER BACK AND HER NOSE IN THE AIR I DON'T MEAN TO ACT ANY MORE AFTER THIS TIME I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR SUCH THINGS OBSERVED MEG WHO WAS AS MUCH A CHILD AS EVER ABOUT DRESSING UP FROLICS
IN HER EARNEST YET TIMID WAY OH SIR THEY DO CARE VERY VERY MUCH ARE YOU THE MUSICAL GIRL HE ASKED WITHOUT ANY STARTLING HEY AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER VERY KINDLY I'M BETH
SHE HAD A DECIDED MOUTH A COMICAL NOSE AND SHARP GRAY EYES WHICH APPEARED TO SEE EVERYTHING AND WERE BY TURNS FIERCE FUNNY OR THOUGHTFUL HER LONG THICK HAIR WAS HER ONE BEAUTY BUT IT WAS USUALLY BUNDLED INTO A NET TO BE OUT OF HER WAY
I DON'T CARE IF HUGO DOES COME AT ME WITH A PISTOL RETURNED AMY WHO WAS NOT GIFTED WITH DRAMATIC POWER BUT WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE SHE WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO BE BORNE OUT SHRIEKING BY THE VILLAIN OF THE PIECE DO IT THIS WAY CLASP YOUR HANDS SO AND STAGGER ACROSS THE ROOM CRYING FRANTICALLY
AND I SHALL PROVIDE THE SLIPPERS FOR HE TOLD ME TO TAKE SPECIAL CARE OF MOTHER WHILE HE WAS GONE
HOW WILL WE GIVE THE THINGS ASKED MEG
DURING ONE OF THE BRIEF CALLS HE MADE HE ARTFULLY LED THE CONVERSATION TO MUSIC AND TALKED AWAY ABOUT GREAT SINGERS WHOM HE HAD SEEN FINE ORGANS HE HAD HEARD
AS YOUNG READERS LIKE TO KNOW HOW PEOPLE LOOK WE WILL TAKE THIS MOMENT TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE SKETCH OF THE FOUR SISTERS WHO SAT KNITTING AWAY IN THE TWILIGHT WHILE THE DECEMBER SNOW FELL QUIETLY WITHOUT AND THE FIRE CRACKLED CHEERFULLY WITHIN
AND SHE RAN AWAY DECLARING SHE WOULD NEVER GO THERE ANY MORE NOT EVEN FOR THE DEAR PIANO NO PERSUASIONS OR ENTICEMENTS COULD OVERCOME HER FEAR TILL THE FACT COMING TO MISTER LAURENCE'S EAR IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY HE SET ABOUT MENDING MATTERS
CAN I DO IT ASKED BETH A FEW WEEKS AFTER THAT EVENTFUL CALL OF HIS YES DEAR IT WILL PLEASE HIM VERY MUCH
IT'S THE BEST WE'VE HAD YET SAID MEG AS THE DEAD VILLAIN SAT UP AND RUBBED HIS ELBOWS I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN WRITE AND ACT SUCH SPLENDID THINGS JO
A QUICK BRIGHT SMILE WENT ROUND LIKE A STREAK OF SUNSHINE BETH CLAPPED HER HANDS REGARDLESS OF THE BISCUIT SHE HELD AND JO TOSSED UP HER NAPKIN CRYING A LETTER A LETTER THREE CHEERS FOR FATHER
SO COME AND DRUM AWAY AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE AND I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO YOU HOW KIND YOU ARE SIR BETH BLUSHED LIKE A ROSE UNDER THE FRIENDLY LOOK HE WORE BUT SHE WAS NOT FRIGHTENED NOW
THEN THINGS WENT SMOOTHLY FOR DON PEDRO DEFIED THE WORLD IN A SPEECH OF TWO PAGES WITHOUT A SINGLE BREAK HAGAR THE WITCH CHANTED AN AWFUL INCANTATION OVER HER KETTLEFUL OF SIMMERING TOADS WITH WEIRD EFFECT
ALL SORTS OF PLEASANT THINGS HAPPENED ABOUT THAT TIME FOR THE NEW FRIENDSHIP FLOURISHED LIKE GRASS IN SPRING EVERY ONE LIKED LAURIE AND HE PRIVATELY INFORMED HIS TUTOR THAT THE MARCHES WERE REGULARLY SPLENDID GIRLS
HE CAN'T GET INTO MISCHIEF IN THAT LITTLE NUNNERY OVER THERE AND MISSUS MARCH IS DOING MORE FOR HIM THAN WE CAN WHAT GOOD TIMES THEY HAD TO BE SURE
HAS ANYONE CALLED BETH HOW IS YOUR COLD MEG JO YOU LOOK TIRED TO DEATH COME AND KISS ME BABY WHILE MAKING THESE MATERNAL INQUIRIES MISSUS MARCH GOT HER WET THINGS OFF HER WARM SLIPPERS ON AND SITTING DOWN IN THE EASY CHAIR
SHE'D NEVER HAVE GONE IN HER RIGHT MIND CRIED HANNAH STARING AFTER HER WHILE THE GIRLS WERE RENDERED QUITE SPEECHLESS BY THE MIRACLE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL MORE AMAZED IF THEY HAD SEEN WHAT BETH DID AFTERWARD
YOU HAD ALL THE LOVELY THINGS YOU COULD COLLECT TO MAKE A CELESTIAL CITY WHAT FUN IT WAS ESPECIALLY GOING BY THE LIONS FIGHTING APOLLYON AND PASSING THROUGH THE VALLEY WHERE THE HOB GOBLINS WERE SAID JO
DREW AMY TO HER LAP PREPARING TO ENJOY THE HAPPIEST HOUR OF HER BUSY DAY THE GIRLS FLEW ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE THINGS COMFORTABLE EACH IN HER OWN WAY MEG ARRANGED THE TEA TABLE JO BROUGHT WOOD AND SET CHAIRS DROPPING OVER TURNING AND CLATTERING EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHED
YES I MEAN TO I GUESS I'LL GO NOW BEFORE I GET FRIGHTENED THINKING ABOUT IT AND TO THE UTTER AMAZEMENT OF THE ASSEMBLED FAMILY BETH WALKED DELIBERATELY DOWN THE GARDEN THROUGH THE HEDGE AND IN AT THE LAURENCES DOOR WELL
AND THE SERVANTS ARE NEVER NEAR THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER NINE O'CLOCK HERE HE ROSE AS IF GOING AND BETH MADE UP HER MIND TO SPEAK FOR THAT LAST ARRANGEMENT LEFT NOTHING TO BE DESIRED
VERY FEW LETTERS WERE WRITTEN IN THOSE HARD TIMES THAT WERE NOT TOUCHING ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH FATHERS SENT HOME
HE SAID TO MISSUS MARCH THE BOY NEGLECTS HIS MUSIC NOW AND I'M GLAD OF IT FOR HE WAS GETTING TOO FOND OF IT BUT THE PIANO SUFFERS FOR WANT OF USE
NOTHING DELIGHTED YOU MORE THAN TO HAVE ME TIE MY PIECE BAGS ON YOUR BACKS FOR BURDENS GIVE YOU HATS AND STICKS AND ROLLS OF PAPER AND LET YOU TRAVEL THROUGH THE HOUSE FROM THE CELLAR WHICH WAS THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION UP UP TO THE HOUSETOP WHERE
THAT'S WHY I DO IT I DETEST RUDE UNLADYLIKE GIRLS I HATE AFFECTED NIMINY PIMINY CHITS
AND STRAIGHTWAY FORGOT HER FEAR HERSELF AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT WHICH THE MUSIC GAVE HER FOR IT WAS LIKE THE VOICE OF A BELOVED FRIEND
BRIGHTENED TO WELCOME HER MEG STOPPED LECTURING AND LIGHTED THE LAMP AMY GOT OUT OF THE EASY CHAIR WITHOUT BEING ASKED AND JO FORGOT HOW TIRED SHE WAS AS SHE SAT UP TO HOLD THE SLIPPERS NEARER TO THE BLAZE THEY ARE QUITE WORN OUT MARMEE MUST HAVE A NEW PAIR
THAT WHEN I COME BACK TO THEM I MAY BE FONDER AND PROUDER THAN EVER OF MY LITTLE WOMEN EVERYBODY SNIFFED WHEN THEY CAME TO THAT PART
BUT SHE GOT NO FURTHER FOR JO QUENCHED HER BY SLAMMING DOWN THE WINDOW
I'VE WANTED IT SO LONG SAID JO WHO WAS A BOOKWORM I PLANNED TO SPEND MINE IN NEW MUSIC SAID BETH WITH A LITTLE SIGH WHICH NO ONE HEARD BUT THE HEARTH BRUSH AND KETTLE HOLDER I SHALL GET A NICE BOX OF FABER'S DRAWING PENCILS
IT WAS A CHEERFUL HOPEFUL LETTER FULL OF LIVELY DESCRIPTIONS OF CAMP LIFE MARCHES AND MILITARY NEWS AND ONLY AT THE END DID THE WRITER'S HEART OVER FLOW WITH FATHERLY LOVE AND LONGING FOR THE LITTLE GIRLS AT HOME
I CAN'T GET OVER MY DISAPPOINTMENT IN NOT BEING A BOY AND IT'S WORSE THAN EVER NOW FOR I'M DYING TO GO AND FIGHT WITH PAPA AND I CAN ONLY STAY HOME AND KNIT LIKE A POKY OLD WOMAN AND JO SHOOK THE BLUE ARMY SOCK TILL THE NEEDLES RATTLED LIKE CASTANETS AND HER BALL BOUNDED ACROSS THE ROOM POOR JO
IT MAKES ME CROSS AND MY HANDS GET SO STIFF I CAN'T PRACTICE WELL AT ALL AND BETH LOOKED AT HER ROUGH HANDS WITH A SIGH THAT ANY ONE COULD HEAR THAT TIME I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF YOU SUFFER AS I DO CRIED AMY
I KNOW I DO TEACHING THOSE TIRESOME CHILDREN NEARLY ALL DAY WHEN I'M LONGING TO ENJOY MYSELF AT HOME BEGAN MEG IN THE COMPLAINING TONE AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE HALF SUCH A HARD TIME AS I DO SAID JO
SAID BETH CONTENTEDLY FROM HER CORNER THE FOUR YOUNG FACES ON WHICH THE FIRELIGHT SHONE BRIGHTENED AT THE CHEERFUL WORDS BUT DARKENED AGAIN AS JO SAID SADLY WE HAVEN'T GOT FATHER AND SHALL NOT HAVE HIM FOR A LONG TIME
IT'S PROPER TO USE GOOD WORDS AND IMPROVE YOUR VOCABILARY RETURNED AMY WITH DIGNITY DON'T PECK AT ONE ANOTHER CHILDREN
AND AWAY HE WENT IN A GREAT HURRY BETH HAD A RAPTURE WITH HER MOTHER AND THEN RUSHED UP TO IMPART THE GLORIOUS NEWS TO HER FAMILY OF INVALIDS AS THE GIRLS WERE NOT HOME
WE CAN'T DO MUCH BUT WE CAN MAKE OUR LITTLE SACRIFICES AND OUGHT TO DO IT GLADLY BUT I AM AFRAID I DON'T AND MEG SHOOK HER HEAD AS SHE THOUGHT REGRETFULLY OF ALL THE PRETTY THINGS SHE WANTED
WHAT THE CHARACTERS OF THE FOUR SISTERS WERE WE WILL LEAVE TO BE FOUND OUT THE CLOCK STRUCK SIX AND HAVING SWEPT UP THE HEARTH BETH PUT A PAIR OF SLIPPERS DOWN TO WARM SOMEHOW THE SIGHT OF THE OLD SHOES HAD A GOOD EFFECT UPON THE GIRLS FOR MOTHER WAS COMING AND EVERYONE
BUT AFTER HE HAD CALLED SAID SOMETHING FUNNY OR KIND TO EACH ONE OF THE GIRLS AND TALKED OVER OLD TIMES WITH THEIR MOTHER NOBODY FELT MUCH AFRAID OF HIM EXCEPT TIMID BETH THE OTHER LION WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE POOR AND LAURIE RICH FOR THIS MADE THEM SHY OF ACCEPTING FAVORS WHICH THEY COULD NOT RETURN
I SUSPECT SHE IS RIGHT AND THAT I'VE BEEN CODDLING THE FELLOW AS IF I'D BEEN HIS GRANDMOTHER LET HIM DO WHAT HE LIKES AS LONG AS HE IS HAPPY
OH DEAR YES HE LIKED IT AMAZINGLY AND WAS SO TOUCHED AND PLEASED BY THAT CONFIDING LITTLE KISS THAT ALL HIS CRUSTINESS VANISHED AND HE JUST SET HER ON HIS KNEE AND LAID HIS WRINKLED CHEEK
DEAR MADAM HOW NICE IT SOUNDS I WISH SOMEONE WOULD WRITE TO ME SO SAID AMY WHO THOUGHT THE OLD FASHIONED ADDRESS VERY ELEGANT I HAVE HAD MANY PAIRS OF SLIPPERS IN MY LIFE BUT I NEVER HAD ANY THAT SUITED ME SO WELL AS YOURS CONTINUES JO
I THOUGHT I'D GET HER SOME WITH MY DOLLAR SAID BETH NO I SHALL CRIED AMY I'M THE OLDEST BEGAN MEG BUT JO CUT IN WITH A DECIDED
NEXT DAY HAVING SEEN BOTH THE OLD AND YOUNG GENTLEMAN OUT OF THE HOUSE BETH AFTER TWO OR THREE RETREATS FAIRLY GOT IN AT THE SIDE DOOR AND MADE HER WAY AS NOISELESSLY AS ANY MOUSE TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE HER IDOL STOOD
I LOVE IT DEARLY AND I'LL COME IF YOU ARE QUITE SURE NOBODY WILL HEAR ME AND BE DISTURBED SHE ADDED FEARING TO BE RUDE AND TREMBLING AT HER OWN BOLDNESS AS SHE SPOKE NOT A SOUL MY DEAR THE HOUSE IS EMPTY HALF THE DAY
THEIR CHEERFUL SOCIETY AND THE COMFORT HE TOOK IN THAT HUMBLE HOME OF THEIRS SO THEY SOON FORGOT THEIR PRIDE AND INTERCHANGED KINDNESSES WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK WHICH WAS THE GREATER
YOU WON'T STOP I KNOW AS LONG AS YOU CAN TRAIL ROUND IN A WHITE GOWN WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN AND WEAR GOLD PAPER JEWELRY YOU ARE THE BEST ACTRESS WE'VE GOT AND THERE'LL BE AN END OF EVERYTHING IF YOU QUIT THE BOARDS SAID JO WE OUGHT TO REHEARSE TONIGHT
IT'S BAD ENOUGH TO BE A GIRL ANYWAY WHEN I LIKE BOY'S GAMES AND WORK AND MANNERS
BUT I'D LIKE TO TRY MACBETH IF WE ONLY HAD A TRAPDOOR FOR BANQUO
A CLUSTER OF GRAVE YET CHEERFUL PANSIES ON A DEEPER PURPLE GROUND WAS PRONOUNCED VERY APPROPRIATE AND PRETTY AND BETH WORKED AWAY EARLY AND LATE WITH OCCASIONAL LIFTS OVER HARD PARTS SHE WAS A NIMBLE LITTLE NEEDLEWOMAN AND THEY WERE FINISHED BEFORE ANYONE GOT TIRED OF THEM
IT MEANT A SPECIAL PULL AND A SPECIAL WAY OF DOING THINGS AND YOU'LL DO WELL MY GIRL TO GIVE UP MISTER TAUSIG'S PROPERTY TO HIM THE SERGEANT SAID STIFFLY
I WAS SURE FROM THE VERY WHISPER IN WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN THAT THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD HE WANTED WAS TO HAVE THAT AGREEMENT MADE PUBLIC BY MY ARREST BUT I TRIPPED UP ON ONE THING I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A MIDDLE WAY FOR A MAN WITH MONEY
IT ONLY STUCK TO HIS TEETH AND HE FOUND HIMSELF STICKING TO THE PAN WITH HIS MOUTH AS WELL AS HIS FEET INDEED HE WAS HELD SECURELY BY THE STICKY STRINGY CANDY
BUT DID NOT LEAVE HIS FEET INSTEAD IT GOT BETWEEN HIS TOES AND HELD HIM STILL FASTER HE TRIED TO BITE IT OFF BUT INSTEAD OF COMING OFF
HE SAID EAGERLY A A CONTRACT JUST A SINGLE SHEET OF LEGAL CAP PAPER IT WAS TYPE WRITTEN AND SIGNED BY MYSELF AND SOME OTHER GENTLEMEN AND FOLDED TWICE THE WOMAN LOOKED AT ME SHE WAS A BIT HARD MOUTHED WITH IRON GRAY HAIR
THE LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS GIVING THE PARTY LET'S PUT HIM IN THE BATH TUB AND SOAK IT OFF JUST THE VERY THING ONE OF THE BOYS REPLIED WAIT TILL I GET SOMETHING TO WRAP HIM IN SO I WON'T GET ALL STUCK UP WITH THE CANDY
CHALLENGED THE ADMIRATION OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS HIS OFFICE WAS ENLARGED AND STILL BEING TOO SMALL
AND THEN PERHAPS I CAN SNEAK INTO THE KITCHEN AND STEAL A PIECE OF CAKE THOUGHT ZIP BUT ALAS HE WAS SO BUSY GAZING UP AT THE LIGHTED WINDOWS TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THE HOUSE THAT HE NEGLECTED TO LOOK WHERE HE WAS STEPPING
AND IN A JIFFY I'D PINNED THAT PRECIOUS PAPER WITH A SAFETY PIN TO THE BABY'S UNDER PETTICOAT PREFERRING THAT RISK TO RISK I SHOULD SAY IT WAS
WE'LL CALL THEM THE TEMPORARILY UN STRAIGHT SHE WAS SATISFIED JUST NOT TO LET ME GET AHEAD OF HER IN THE LEAST PARTICULAR BUT SHE WASN'T MEAN AND SHE WOULD LEND ME A NICKEL NOT AN EMOTIONALLY EXTRAVAGANT TEN CENT PIECE BUT JUST A NICKEL
THIS TIME THEY GOT HIM IN THE TUB SAFELY AND BEGAN TO TURN THE WATER IN THE TUB WAS SLIPPERY AND SO WAS THE CANDY AND AS THE WATER CREPT UP TO WHERE ZIP WAS TIED NOT HAND AND FOOT BUT WORSE STILL
FOR IF ONE BOX WAS SUFFICIENT TO PURIFY THE BLOOD ELEVEN EXTRA BOXES WOULD HAVE NO INJURIOUS EFFECT I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK IN JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT AND BY THAT TIME I HAD BECOME SUCH A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE EFFICACY OF BRANDRETH'S PILLS
THE ADMIRABLE DRAGON IN THE BLUE DRESS DIDN'T WAVER A BIT BECAUSE HER SUPERIOR SPOKE PLEASANTLY TO ME SHE ONLY WATCHED AND LISTENED WHICH PUTS YOU IN A DIFFICULT POSITION WHEN YOUR NAME'S NANCE OLDEN YOU HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH I'VE BEEN DETAINED
ON THE WAY HE HIT A HAMPER OF CLOTHES ON THE LANDING AND IT JOINED HIM AND WENT BUMPETY BUMP BANGETY BANG TO THE BOTTOM AND OUT INTO THE KITCHEN HITTING THE WAITRESS WHO WAS CARRYING A TRAY OF GLASSES FILLED WITH FRUIT LEMONADE
DOCTOR BRANDRETH IS A LIBERAL MAN AND A PLEASANT ENTERTAINING AND EDIFYING COMPANION HE DESERVES ALL THE SUCCESS HE HAS EVER RECEIVED
SO FINALLY THE DOCTOR RAPPED ON THE HARDWAY KITCHEN DOOR TO ASK THE MAID IF ZIP HAD NOT SLIPPED IN THE HOUSE AND GOTTEN UP ON THE ROOF HE KNOCKED REPEATEDLY BUT NO ONE ANSWERED AS HE STILL HEARD ZIP HOWLING
AND SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE TALKING ALL AT ONCE HE MADE BOLD TO OPEN THE DOOR AND STEP IN WHAT HE SAW YOU ALREADY KNOW AS BY THIS TIME THE CHILDREN HAD STARTED TO BATHE ZIP THE DOCTOR WAS TOLD TO GO RIGHT UPSTAIRS
OH DEAR DEAR IT'S WELL YOU HAD THAT BEAUTIFUL WIG OF RED HAIR THAT PUTS EVEN CARTER'S IN THE SHADE
I SAID IMPULSIVELY IF I WERE YOU AND ANYBODY HAD STOLEN A VALUABLE PAPER FROM ME I'D HAVE HIM ARRESTED I WOULD I SHOULD NOT CARE A RAP WHAT THE PUBLIC EXPOSURE DID TO HIS REPUTATION SO LONG SO LONG
AND WHEN THE CHILDREN TRIED TO PULL IT OFF IT NEARLY KILLED HIM WITH PAIN FOR IT TOOK ALL THE LITTLE FINE HAIRS OF HIS COAT WITH IT THE WINDOW OF THE BATHROOM WAS OPEN AND THE DOCTOR COMING OUT ON HIS FRONT PORCH TO LOOK AT THE SKY BEFORE RETIRING
THAT IF THERE'S NOT ALWAYS FIRE WHERE THERE IS SMOKE IT'S BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S BEEN CLEVER ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH TO COVER THE BLAZE WELL GOOD BY I SAID PUTTING OUT MY HAND IT'S BEEN DISAGREEABLE BUT I'M OBLIGED TO YOU FOR
AND INTRODUCED MYSELF WITHOUT CEREMONY I TOLD HIM MY EXPERIENCES HE WAS DELIGHTED I NEXT HEARTILY INDORSED EVERY WORD STATED IN HIS ADVERTISEMENTS HE WAS NOT SURPRISED FOR HE KNEW THE EFFECTS OF HIS PILLS WERE SUCH AS I DESCRIBED
WAS A BIG BALL OF MOLASSES CANDY ROLLING DOWN THE SLOPING WALK ALL THEY COULD SEE IN THE SEMI DARKNESS WAS THE CANDY FOR ZIP WAS TOO BALLED UP TO SHOW A BIT OF DOG STICKING OUT OF THE SOFT MESS
WHICH HAD BEEN BENT DOWN BETWEEN HIS FORE LEGS AS THE CANDY BEGAN TO LOOSEN AND DROP OFF FIRST ONE BLACK EAR STOOD UP AND THEN THE OTHER AND LAST THE LITTLE LEGS BEGAN TO SHOOT OUT
AND HIS POOR LITTLE TAIL STUCK OUT LIKE A HANDLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALL THAT WAS ALL THAT COULD BE SEEN OF ZIP AT THAT MOMENT FOR IN HIS NUMEROUS ROLLS THE CANDY HAD SPREAD ALL OVER HIM UNTIL HE WAS NO LONGER A DOG WITH LEGS
BLEEDING REDUCES THE VITAL POWERS BRANDRETH'S PILLS INCREASE THEM SO IN SICKNESS NEVER BE BLED ESPECIALLY IN DIZZINESS AND APOPLEXY BUT ALWAYS USE BRANDRETH'S PILLS
THE BOY MANAGED TO GET HIM TO THE ROOM AND WAS JUST ABOUT TO DROP HIM IN THE TUB FROM THE APRON WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT THE APRON WAS STICKING TO THE CANDY ONE OF THE BOYS GAVE IT A JERK TO LOOSEN IT BUT SAD TO RELATE HE GAVE TOO VIGOROUS A PULL
NANCY OLDEN I SAID TO MYSELF MORE IN SORROW THAN IN ANGER YOU'VE MET YOUR MATCH RIGHT HERE WHEN A WOMAN KNOWS A FACT AND STATES IT WITH SUCH QUIET CONVICTION WITHOUT THE LEAST UNNECESSARY EMPHASIS AND NOT A SUPERFLUOUS WORD
AND THEN THEY HAVE RETAILED THE PILLS FROM THEIR DRUG SHOPS I LAUGHED AT THIS SHREWD SUGGESTION AND REMARKED THIS MAY BE SO BUT I GUESS MY IMAGINATION DID THE BUSINESS
WHICH WAY I'LL COME BACK MISTER TAUSIG TO RECEIVE YOUR APOLOGY BUT YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT ME TO GO TO LUNCH AFTER THIS HE GROWLED A WRATHFUL RESENTING MOUTHFUL BUT HE LOOKED A BIT PUZZLED JUST THE SAME
I SAID HUMBLY I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T BE LIKELY TO MAKE A MISTAKE BUT JUST TO CONVINCE ME DO YOU MIND LETTING ME GO BACK TO LOOK NOT AT ALL SHE SAID PLACIDLY IF I GO WITH YOU THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT LOOK
I GRINNED RIGHT UP AT HIM SO LONG AS IT DIDN'T HURT ME MYSELF IN THE EYES OF THE LAW MAD OH HE WAS HOPPING A GERMAN SWEAR WORD BURST FROM HIM I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT BUT I CAN IMAGINE
THOUSANDS OF PERSONS MAY BE READING YOUR ADVERTISEMENT WHILE YOU ARE EATING OR SLEEPING OR ATTENDING TO YOUR BUSINESS HENCE PUBLIC ATTENTION IS ATTRACTED NEW CUSTOMERS COME TO YOU AND IF YOU RENDER THEM A SATISFACTORY EQUIVALENT FOR THEIR MONEY
THERE WAS NO HOPE THERE I TURNED TO GO I'LL LEND YOU A NICKEL TO GET HOME IF YOU'LL LEAVE ME YOUR ADDRESS SHE SAID AFTER A MOMENT OH THAT ADMIRABLE WOMAN
THAT I HARDLY STOPPED LONG ENOUGH TO SPEAK WITH MY FAMILY BEFORE I HASTENED TO THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF DOCTOR BRANDRETH TO CONGRATULATE HIM ON BEING THE GREATEST PUBLIC BENEFACTOR OF THE AGE I FOUND THE DOCTOR AT HOME
AND I HAVEN'T CHANGED MY DRESS YET YOU'LL CHANGE IT ALL RIGHT FOR SOMETHING NOT SO BECOMING IF YOU DON'T SHELL OUT THAT PAPER PAPER YES PAPER LOOK HERE IF YOU GIVE IT BACK TO ME THIS MINUTE NOW I'LL NOT PROSECUTE YOU FOR
THE DOCTOR WAS UNEASY BUT HE ASKED ME AS A FAVOR TO BRING HIM ONE OF THE EMPTY PILL BOXES WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM THE SOUTH THE NEXT DAY I COMPLIED WITH HIS REQUEST AND I WILL DO THE DOCTOR JUSTICE TO SAY THAT ON COMPARISON IT PROVED AS HE HAD SUSPECTED
EVER EXPERIENCED BY A MEMBER OF THE HUMAN FAMILY BUT WAS A MOST IRREFRAGABLE EVIDENCE OF THE IMPURITY OF THE BLOOD AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BLASPHEMY TO HAVE DENIED THE SELF EVIDENT THEORY THAT
AND WAS HOLDING IT SO THAT THE WATER COULD NOT GET TO ZIP'S HEAD THEN WITH ONE HAND HE GENTLY THREW THE WATER UPON THE CANDY UNTIL IT BEGAN TO LOOSEN AND FALL OFF FIRST HE RELEASED THE LITTLE DOG'S HEAD
DID YOU FIND A BABY TOO DID I FIND HE GLARED AT ME I FIND YOU THAT'S ENOUGH NOW BUT THE LUNCHEON WAS TO BE AT TWELVE THIRTY I LAUGHED
BEYOND HIM WAS AN OVERTURNED HAMPER OF SOILED CLOTHES WITH STOCKINGS COLLARS SHEETS AND PETTICOATS SPILLING OUT OF IT AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM STOOD MISSUS HARDWAY WIPING THE LEMONADE OFF HER DRESS
SOLELY TO THE ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT COLUMN UPON COLUMN OF ADVERTISEMENTS APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE SHAPE OF LEARNED AND SCIENTIFIC PATHOLOGICAL DISSERTATIONS THE VERY READING OF WHICH WOULD TEMPT A POOR MORTAL TO RUSH FOR A BOX OF BRANDRETH'S PILLS
YOU MUST BE RIGHT I SAID AT LENGTH LOOKING WOEFULLY UP AT HER YES I KNEW I WAS SHE SAID STEADILY I MUST HAVE LOST IT YES
BRANDRETH'S PILLS MAGNIFICENT ADVERTISING POWER OF IMAGINATION IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR DOCTOR BENJAMIN BRANDRETH COMMENCED ADVERTISING IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK
YOU ZIP KEEP STILL OR YOU'LL SLIP OUT OF THE APRON YOU'RE WRAPPED IN AND GET MY BEST SUIT ALL STICKY CALLED THE LITTLE BOY WHO HELD HIM IN HIS ARMS AND WAS CARRYING HIM UP TO THE BATHROOM BY SQUEEZING HIM TIGHTLY
SHE OUGHT TO BE RULING EMPIRES INSTEAD OF SEARCHING THIEVES LOOK AT THE BALANCE OF HER MAG MY BEST ACTING HADN'T SHAKEN HER
WHOSE LIFE GIVING POWER NO PEN CAN DESCRIBE
ALL THIS MADE THE CHILDREN LAUGH TO SEE WHAT APPEARED TO BE A BIG BALL OF CANDY DEVELOP INTO A LITTLE DOG AT LAST WHEN ZIP WAS ENTIRELY CLEAN AND HAD BEEN WRAPPED IN A BIG BATH TOWEL TO DRY
HIS FACTORY WAS AT HIS RESIDENCE IN HUDSON STREET HE PUT UP A LARGE GILT SIGN OVER THE SUN OFFICE FIVE OR SIX FEET WIDE BY THE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING WHICH ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION AS AT THAT TIME IT WAS PROBABLY THE LARGEST SIGN IN NEW YORK
A FUNNY INCIDENT OCCURRED TO ME IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GREAT PILL IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX WHILE I WAS TRAVELLING THROUGH THE STATES OF ALABAMA MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA I BECAME CONVINCED BY READING DOCTOR BRANDRETH'S ADVERTISEMENTS THAT I NEEDED HIS PILLS
I DEMANDED HE GRINNED AND SHRUGGED HIS BIG SHOULDERS WE'VE A WAY OF FINDING OUT YOU KNOW HERE GIVE IT UP OR BUT WHAT DOES HE SAY I'VE TAKEN WHAT CHARGE IS THERE AGAINST ME
LOOKING UP HE SAW THAT THE HOUSE WAS LIGHTED MORE THAN WAS USUAL AND HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT THEY MUST BE HAVING A LITTLE DANCE OR A CHILDREN'S PARTY OF SOME KIND JUST THEN HE THOUGHT HE GOT A WHIFF OF BOILING MOLASSES
AND IN SPITE OF MY BEING SO SURE HE WOULDN'T HAVE ME ARRESTED I'D GUESS MAG GUESS THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY THE BABY OF COURSE IN THE MOMENT I HAD IT WASN'T LONG I'D STOOPED DOWN PRETENDING TO KISS THAT CHERUB GOOD BY
BUT AT THE TIME BRANDRETH STARTED HIS WAS CONSIDERED THE MOST LIBERAL NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING OF THE DAY ADVERTISING IS TO A GENUINE ARTICLE WHAT MANURE IS TO LAND IT LARGELY INCREASES THE PRODUCT
AND HAD BECOME THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THE ONLY REAL GREENHORNS IN THE WORLD WERE THOSE WHO PREFERRED MEAT OR BREAD TO BRANDRETH'S PILLS I TOOK THEM MORNING NOON AND NIGHT IN FACT THE ADVERTISEMENTS ANNOUNCED THAT ONE COULD NOT TAKE TOO MANY
I DIDN'T KNOW JUST HOW FAR I MIGHT GO WITH HER SHE KNEW THE PAPER WASN'T ON ME AND I COULD SEE SHE WAS DISPOSED TO BELIEVE I WAS AS NICE AS SHE'D HAVE LIKED ME TO BE
AND WHEN THE RAJA'S MEN SAW THAT KARA AND GUJA HAD NOTHING BUT A DRUM THEY SAID YES IT IS YOUR TURN
EXCEPT NEW ORLEANS PASSED UNDER THE BRITISH FLAG THE REMAINDER OF THE LOUISIANA TERRITORY WAS TRANSFERRED TO SPAIN AND FRENCH IMPERIAL AMBITIONS ON THE AMERICAN CONTINENT WERE LAID TO REST
CONQUESTS EQUALING IN RAPIDITY AND FAR SURPASSING IN MAGNITUDE THOSE OF CORTES AND PIZARRO HAD BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE EAST WELL COULD THE MERCHANTS OF LONDON DECLARE THAT UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF WILLIAM PITT THE IMPERIAL GENIUS OF THIS WORLD WIDE CONFLICT
GUJA TOLD HIM ON NO ACCOUNT TO LET IT GO BUT AT LAST KARA GOT SO TIRED
IT IS DESPAIR THAT BROUGHT YOU HITHER AND YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE YOUR DESTINY
SO WELL UNDERSTOOD IN DIPLOMATIC CIRCLES APPLIED NEARLY AS WELL TO THE ORIGINAL THIRTEEN AMERICAN COLONIES AS TO THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE THE NECESSITY FOR COMMON DEFENSE IF NOT EQUALLY GREAT WAS CERTAINLY ALWAYS PRESSING
NOT TO PUNISH THE INNOCENT FOR THE GUILTY SIR SAID THE YOUNG MAN TO THE VIZIER I DO PROTEST THAT I AM HE WHO COMMITTED THIS VILE ACT AND NOBODY ELSE HAD ANY CONCERN IN IT MY SON SAID THE OLD MAN
OF SQUANTO AND SAMOSET TEACHING THE PILGRIMS THE WAYS OF THE WILDS OF ROGER WILLIAMS BUYING HIS LANDS FROM THE FRIENDLY NATIVES OR OF WILLIAM PENN TREATING WITH THEM ON HIS ARRIVAL IN AMERICA
ON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE ENGLAND SUBSIDIZED PRUSSIAN ARMS TO HOLD FRANCE AT BAY IN INDIA ON THE BANKS OF THE GANGES AS ON THE BANKS OF THE SAINT LAWRENCE BRITISH ARMS WERE TRIUMPHANT WELL COULD THE HISTORIAN WRITE
WHO HAD LIKEWISE FORCED HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD CAME UP TO HIM SAYING DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT THIS YOUNG MAN TELLS YOU I KILLED THAT LADY WHO WAS FOUND IN THE TRUNK AND THIS PUNISHMENT OUGHT ONLY TO FALL UPON ME I CONJURE YOU IN THE NAME OF GOD
WHO UNDOUBTEDLY COMMITTED THE CRIME WITHOUT WITNESS AND PERHAPS MAY BE ALREADY GONE FROM HENCE ANY OTHER VIZIER THAN I WOULD TAKE SOME WRETCHED PERSON OUT OF PRISON AND CAUSE HIM TO BE PUT TO DEATH TO SATISFY THE CALIPH BUT I WILL NOT BURDEN MY CONSCIENCE WITH SUCH A BARBAROUS ACTION
AS WELL AS THE SAINT LAWRENCE
AT THE JUNCTION OF THE STREAMS FORMING THE OHIO THOUGH THEY WERE WARNED BY GEORGE WASHINGTON IN THE NAME OF THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA
THAT SOUNDED THE FIRST NOTE OF COLONIAL ALARM
AND FROM THAT TIME TO THIS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CATCH ONE FISH AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE A WIFE AND SMALL CHILDREN AND NOTHING TO MAINTAIN THEM
WHO OPENED THE LAKE REGION AND LA SALLE WHO IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY TWO HAD GONE DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI TO THE GULF HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY THE BUILDERS OF FORTS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE FRENCH FOUNDED NEW ORLEANS THUS TAKING POSSESSION OF THE GATEWAY TO THE MISSISSIPPI
AND THEREUPON MANY MEN TRIED TO KILL THEM BUT THE KITES HAD MADE THEIR NEST OF PLOUGHS AND CLOD CRUSHERS SO THAT THE ARROWS COULD NOT HIT THEM AND THE SHOOTERS HAD TO GIVE UP THE ATTEMPT
AND PUT THEM ONE BY ONE INTO THE DRUM WHEN THE RAJA'S ATTENDANTS CAME BACK AND SAW THAT THERE WERE TWO MEN IN THE TREE THEY CALLED OUT WHY HAVE YOU DISHONOURED OUR RAJA WE WILL KILL YOU KARA AND GUJA ANSWERED COME AND SEE WHO WILL DO THE KILLING
WHAT PAINS SOEVER THEY TOOK THEY COULD NOT DISCOVER THE MURDERER SO THAT THE VIZIER CONCLUDED HIS LIFE TO BE LOST THE THIRD DAY BEING ARRIVED AN OFFICER CAME TO THE UNFORTUNATE MINISTER WITH A SUMMONS TO FOLLOW HIM WHICH THE VIZIER OBEYED
THEY WOULD NOT TAKE TIME TO UNDO IT BUT CUT THE THREAD WITH A KNIFE AND TOOK OUT OF THE BASKET A PACKAGE WRAPT UP IN A SORRY PIECE OF HANGING AND BOUND ABOUT WITH A ROPE WHICH BEING UNTIED THEY FOUND TO THEIR GREAT AMAZEMENT THE CORPSE OF A YOUNG LADY
WERE JUST GOING TO BE SACRIFICED WHEN A YOUNG MAN OF HANDSOME MIEN PRESSED THROUGH THE CROWD TILL HE CAME UP TO THE GRAND VIZIER
AND THROW MY SUBJECTS INTO THE TIGRIS THAT THEY MAY CRY FOR VENGEANCE AGAINST ME AT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT
AT THESE WORDS THE YOUNG MAN SPOKE AGAIN I SWEAR BY THE GREAT GOD WHO HAS RAISED THE HEAVENS SO HIGH THAT I AM THE MAN WHO KILLED THE LADY CUT HER IN PIECES AND ABOUT FOUR DAYS AGO THREW HER INTO THE TIGRIS
AND WENT OUT ALL THREE TOGETHER THEY PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL PLACES AND BY SEVERAL MARKETS AS THEY ENTERED A SMALL STREET THEY PERCEIVED BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON A TALL MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD WHO CARRIED NETS ON HIS HEAD AND A STAFF IN HIS HAND
THOUGH THESE WORDS OCCASIONED GREAT JOY TO THE VIZIER YET HE COULD NOT BUT PITY THE YOUNG MAN IN WHOSE LOOK HE SAW SOMETHING THAT INSTEAD OF EVINCING GUILT WAS ENGAGING BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO ANSWER HIM A TALL MAN ADVANCED IN YEARS
THEY CAME TO THE BANK OF THE RIVER AND THE FISHERMAN HAVING THROWN IN HIS NET WHEN HE DREW IT AGAIN BROUGHT UP A TRUNK CLOSE SHUT AND VERY HEAVY THE CALIPH MADE THE GRAND VIZIER PAY HIM ONE HUNDRED SEQUINS IMMEDIATELY AND SENT HIM AWAY
AND FRANCE AUSTRIA SPAIN AND MINOR POWERS ON THE OTHER ON AMERICAN SOIL THE DEFEAT OF BRADDOCK IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE AND WOLFE'S EXPLOIT IN CAPTURING QUEBEC FOUR YEARS LATER WERE THE DRAMATIC FEATURES
THEY THREW HIM A BIT OF SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT THE TIGER WOULD NOT GO AWAY BUT LAY THERE EXPECTING TO BE FED AND KARA AND GUJA DEBATED HOW TO GET RID OF HIM THEN GUJA SUDDENLY JUMPED UP AND DASHED AT THE TIGER AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE TAIL AND BEGAN TO TWIST THE TAIL
BELIEVED HIM ESPECIALLY SINCE THE OLD MAN MADE NO ANSWER WHEREUPON TURNING TO THE YOUNG MAN WRETCH SAID HE WHAT MADE THEE COMMIT THAT DETESTABLE CRIME AND WHAT IS IT THAT MOVES THEE TO OFFER THYSELF VOLUNTARILY TO DIE
THE SECOND OF THESE WARS HAD HARDLY CLOSED HOWEVER BEFORE THE ENGLISH COLONISTS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED ABOUT THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING FRENCH DOMINION IN THE WEST MARQUETTE AND JOLIET
HAST THOU THE COURAGE TO GO BACK AND CAST THY NET ONCE MORE WE WILL GIVE THEE A HUNDRED SEQUINS FOR WHAT THOU SHALT BRING UP AT THIS PROPOSAL THE FISHERMAN FORGETTING ALL HIS DAY'S TOIL
WHEN THE TRUNK WAS OPENED THEY FOUND IN IT A LARGE BASKET MADE OF PALM LEAVES
AND THEN SHOT THEM BOTH THROUGH THE HOLE IN A CLOD CRUSHER INTO WHICH THE POLE FITS AND THE TWO KITES FELL DOWN DEAD AT THE SOURCE OF THE GANGES AND JUMNA AND WHERE THEY FELL THEY MADE A GREAT DEPRESSION IN THE GROUND THEN KARA AND GUJA
CALLED HIS TRIBESMEN TO A WAR OF EXTERMINATION WHICH BROUGHT THE STRENGTH OF ALL NEW ENGLAND TO THE FIELD AND ENDED IN HIS OWN DESTRUCTION
IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE THEY OCCUPIED CROWN POINT IN SEVENTEEN FORTY NINE THEY FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THEIR DOMINION OVER ALL THE TERRITORY DRAINED BY THE OHIO RIVER HAVING ASSERTED THIS LOFTY CLAIM
THEY HAD YOUNG ONES IN A NEST IN A TREE AND USED TO CARRY OFF CHILDREN TO FEED THEIR NESTLINGS UNTIL THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS DESOLATED SO THE WHOLE POPULATION WENT IN A BODY TO THE RAJA AND TOLD HIM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IF HE COULD NOT HAVE THE KITES KILLED
WHICH ALONE COULD SPEAK FOR ALL THE PROVINCES AT THE SAME TIME NEITHER DID THE PROPRIETORS AND THE GOVERNORS WHO SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER IN AN IRREGULAR TRAIN
COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY PERSON THAT COULD GIVE ME THE LEAST ACCOUNT OF HIM
PERSONAL TREACHERY OR A FLASH OF BAD TEMPER OFTEN SET IN MOTION DESTRUCTIVE FORCES OF THE MOST TERRIBLE CHARACTER ON ONE SIDE OF THE LEDGER MAY BE SET INNUMERABLE GENEROUS RECORDS
MAY BE WELDED INTO A SOLID AND COMPACT BODY BY AN ATTACK FROM A FOREIGN POWER THE IMPERATIVE CALL TO COMMON DEFENSE THE HABIT OF SHARING COMMON BURDENS
AS THE DIFFICULTIES AROSE MAINLY ON THE FRONTIERS WHERE THE RESTLESS AND PUSHING PIONEERS WERE MAKING THEIR WAY WITH GUN AND AX NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WAS THE RESULT OF CHANCE RATHER THAN OF CALCULATION
CARRIED THE BODIES TO THE RAJA AND HE GAVE THEM A GRANT OF LAND AND THEIR GRATEFUL NEIGHBOURS MADE A LARGE RICE FIELD OF THE DEPRESSION WHICH THE KITES HAD MADE IN THE EARTH AND THIS WAS GIVEN TO KARA AND GUJA AS SERVICE LAND TO THEIR GREAT DELIGHT
IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE WHOLE FRONTIER WAS ABLAZE NATHANIEL BACON VAINLY ATTEMPTED TO STIR THE COLONIAL GOVERNOR TO PUT UP AN ADEQUATE DEFENSE AND FAILING IN THAT PLEA HIMSELF HEADED A REVOLT AND A SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION AGAINST THE INDIANS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE GENERAL STATEMENTS ABOUT THE RELATIONS OF THE COLONISTS TO THE INDIANS THE PROBLEM WAS PRESENTED IN DIFFERENT SHAPE IN DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF AMERICA IT WAS NOT HANDLED ACCORDING TO ANY COHERENT OR UNIFORM PLAN BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
NOTHING LIKE THE ACT OF EATING FOR EQUALISING MEN DYING IS NOTHING TO IT THE PHILOSOPHER DIES SENTENTIOUSLY THE PHARISEE OSTENTATIOUSLY THE SIMPLE HEARTED HUMBLY
AND FOLLOWED DIXON OUT OF THE ROOM I CAN'T LEAVE HER I MUST WRITE TO THEM AT OXFORD TO SEE THAT THE PREPARATIONS ARE MADE THEY CAN BE GETTING ON WITH THESE TILL I ARRIVE CAN'T MISSUS LENNOX COME TO HER
SURELY I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM WHEN THE FAMILY FIRST CAME TO MILTON THE SON WHO WAS CONCERNED IN THAT MUTINY I NEVER HEARD OF HIM TILL THIS MOMENT WHERE DOES HE LIVE IN SPAIN
MY POOR SISTER HALE
TO TRY BECAUSE ANOTHER EXTOLLED WHAT HE REVERENCED AND PASSIONATELY LOVED TO OUTDO HIM IN LAUDATION
HE REGRETTED HE HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF YOU LATELY I AM OBLIGED TO YOU FOR WISHING TO SHOW HIM RESPECT BUT ABOUT FREDERICK DOES HE NEVER COME TO ENGLAND NEVER
IF IT DID NOT EXCEED THE LOVER IN HER ESTIMATION WHEN HER BROTHER AND MISTER BELL CAME IN FANNY BLUSHED AND SIMPERED AND FLUTTERED OVER THE SIGNS OF HER EMPLOYMENT IN A WAY WHICH COULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO DRAW ATTENTION FROM ANY ONE ELSE BUT MISTER BELL
NOT AT FIRST AND NOT TILL I HAD PUT IT INTO HIS HEAD I ADMIRED MISS HALE EVERY ONE MUST DO SO SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE SAID MISTER THORNTON DRIVEN TO BAY BY MISTER BELL'S PERTINACIOUS QUESTIONING
HE MINCED UP SOME OF THE FOWL FOR MARGARET AND PEPPERED AND SALTED IT WELL BUT WHEN DIXON FOLLOWING HIS DIRECTIONS TRIED TO FEED HER THE LANGUID SHAKE OF HEAD
MARGARET HAD REMAINED IN THE SAME STATE WHITE MOTIONLESS SPEECHLESS TEARLESS THEY HAD TOLD HER THAT HER AUNT SHAW WAS COMING
AND BEING SERVED IN BUTCHER'S MEAT BY OUR OWN FAMILY BUTCHER I CAN ASSURE YOU THE HOT DINNERS THE MATRON TURNS OUT ARE BY NO MEANS TO BE DESPISED DO YOU TASTE EACH DISH AS IT GOES IN IN VIRTUE OF YOUR OFFICE
BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPRESSED EITHER SURPRISE OR PLEASURE OR DISLIKE TO THE IDEA MISTER BELL WHOSE APPETITE HAD RETURNED AND WHO APPRECIATED DIXON'S ENDEAVOURS TO GRATIFY IT
IF YOU DON'T LIKE SHOLTO TO BE SO LONG ABSENT FROM YOU EDITH I HOPE YOU WILL LET ME GO DOWN TO MILTON AND GIVE WHAT ASSISTANCE I CAN
ACHES ROUND YOU LIKE A STRONG DISEASE AND NEW WHAT HOPE WHAT HELP
YOU MUST NOT GO TO THE CLARENDON WE HAVE FIVE OR SIX EMPTY BED ROOMS AT HOME WELL AIRED I THINK YOU MAY TRUST MY MOTHER FOR THAT THEN I'LL ONLY RUN UP STAIRS AND WISH THAT WAN GIRL GOOD NIGHT
SHE'S COME BACK TO ENGLAND ISN'T SHE YES SIR SHE'S COME BACK BUT I DON'T THINK SHE WILL LIKE TO LEAVE MISSUS LENNOX AT SUCH AN INTERESTING TIME SAID DIXON WHO DID NOT MUCH APPROVE OF A STRANGER ENTERING THE HOUSEHOLD TO SHARE WITH HER IN HER RULING CARE OF MARGARET
WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED TO HIM EXTERNAL TO HIS RELATION TO HER HE COULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN OF THAT TIME WHEN HE COULD HAVE SEEN HER EVERY DAY WHEN HE HAD HER WITHIN HIS GRASP AS IT WERE AS A TIME OF SUFFERING
SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE COME TRUE AND SINCERE AS WAS HER SYMPATHY WITH MARGARET
BUT AFTER WIPING HER EYES AND STEADYING HER VOICE SHE MANAGED TO TELL MISTER BELL THAT MISSUS LENNOX WAS TOO NEAR HER CONFINEMENT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE ANY JOURNEY AT PRESENT WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST HAVE MISSUS SHAW
BUT YOU ARE HARDLY ACQUAINTED WITH OUR DARKSHIRE FELLOWS FOR ALL YOU'RE A DARKSHIRE MAN YOURSELF THEY HAVE SUCH A SENSE OF HUMOUR AND SUCH A RACY MODE OF EXPRESSION
SHE LAY ON THE SOFA WITH HER EYES SHUT NEVER SPEAKING BUT WHEN SPOKEN TO AND THEN REPLYING IN WHISPERS MISTER BELL WAS PERPLEXED HE DARED NOT LEAVE HER
WITH AN IMPLIED MEANING WHICH HER SON UNDERSTOOD WELL
SHE WAS AS CURT AS SHE DURST BE IN TELLING HIM THAT HE COULD SEE NONE OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT IT WAS RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE TO BE CONTRADICTED IN HER STATEMENT BY MISTER BELL'S OPENING THE STUDY DOOR AND CALLING OUT THORNTON
OF THE BERESFORD BLOOD OF THE STATION SO SHE WAS PLEASED TO TERM IT FROM WHICH HER YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN OUSTED AND TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW PLEASE GOD TO BE RESTORED
I HOPE I MAY BE ALLOWED TO GO CERTAINLY THANKFULLY YOU'RE A GOOD FELLOW AFTER ALL THORNTON HALE LIKED YOU HE SPOKE TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY ABOUT YOU AT OXFORD
THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING ABROAD
IN COMPARISON WITH THAT POOR CREATURE THERE THAT HELPLESS HOMELESS FRIENDLESS MARGARET LYING AS STILL ON THAT SOFA AS IF IT WERE AN ALTAR TOMB AND SHE THE STONE STATUE ON IT I TELL YOU
THE POOR IDIOT BLINDLY AS THE SPARROW FALLS TO THE GROUND THE PHILOSOPHER AND IDIOT PUBLICAN AND PHARISEE ALL EAT AFTER THE SAME FASHION GIVEN AN EQUALLY GOOD DIGESTION THERE'S THEORY FOR THEORY FOR YOU
SHE ASKED ABOUT AS BROKEN DOWN BY THIS LAST STROKE AS SHE CAN BE
IF THEY HAD NOT ASKED ME I WOULD NO MORE HAVE INTRUDED ON THEM THAN I'D HAVE GONE TO THE MESS AT THE BARRACKS WITHOUT INVITATION I SHOULD THINK YOU WERE RATHER A RESTRAINT ON YOUR HOSTS CONVERSATION THEY CAN'T ABUSE THE MASTERS WHILE YOU'RE THERE
BESIDES SHE SAYS AND VERY JUSTLY THAT SHE HAS FRIENDS SHE MUST SEE THAT SHE MUST WISH GOOD BYE TO SEVERAL PEOPLE AND THEN HER AUNT WORRIED HER ABOUT OLD CLAIMS AND WAS SHE FORGETFUL OF OLD FRIENDS
INTERESTING TIME BE MISTER BELL RESTRICTED HIMSELF TO COUGHING OVER THE END OF HIS SENTENCE SHE COULD BE CONTENT TO BE AT VENICE OR NAPLES OR SOME OF THOSE POPISH PLACES AT THE LAST INTERESTING TIME
AND FIRST FOUND THE PASSIONATE RELIEF OF TEARS ON HER AUNT'S SHOULDER ALL THOUGHTS OF QUIET HABITUAL LOVE OF TENDERNESS FOR YEARS OF RELATIONSHIP TO THE DEAD
BUT I SAW THAT THE MEN WOULD BE HURT IF AFTER MAKING THE ADVANCE I DIDN'T MEET THEM HALF WAY SO I WENT IN AND I NEVER MADE A BETTER DINNER IN MY LIFE I TOLD THEM MY NEXT NEIGHBOURS I MEAN FOR I'M NO SPEECH MAKER
IS THAT ALL
SHE WAS NEVER SO GRACIOUS AS WHEN RECEIVING HER SON'S FRIENDS IN HER SON'S HOUSE AND THE MORE UNEXPECTED THEY WERE
I HOPE YOU HAVE A WHITE WAND I WAS VERY SCRUPULOUS AT FIRST IN CONFINING MYSELF TO THE MERE PURCHASING PART
BUT MARGARET WAS THE FIRST TO HEAR THE STOPPING OF THE CAB THAT BROUGHT HER AUNT FROM THE RAILWAY STATION HER EYELIDS QUIVERED HER LIPS COLOURED AND TREMBLED MISTER BELL WENT DOWN TO MEET MISSUS SHAW
AND MAKE IT LOOK NEW AND BRIGHT AND CHEER HER UP A LITTLE IN THE SAME SPIRIT OF KINDNESS MISSUS SHAW JOURNEYED TO MILTON OCCASIONALLY DREADING THE FIRST MEETING AND WONDERING HOW IT WOULD BE GOT OVER
FOR WHEN MISTER BELL HAD FIRST GONE UP STAIRS MISSUS SHAW LAY ASLEEP ON THE SOFA AND NO SOUND BROKE THE SILENCE MISSUS THORNTON GAVE MISTER BELL HER FORMAL HOSPITABLE WELCOME
HE PAUSED AS IF ASKING A QUESTION BUT HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER FROM HIS COMPANION THE ECHO OF WHOSE THOUGHTS KEPT REPEATING WHERE SHE HAD SUFFERED SO MUCH
HE HAD A PLATEFUL OF SOMETHING BROUGHT UP TO HIM IN GENERAL HE WAS PARTICULAR AND DAINTY ENOUGH AND KNEW WELL EACH SHADE OF FLAVOUR IN HIS FOOD BUT NOW THE DEVILLED CHICKEN TASTED LIKE SAWDUST
BUT YOU ARE A FRIEND AND I EXPECT YOU WILL PAY MY EXPERIMENT THE RESPECT OF SILENCE IT IS BUT A NEW BROOM AT PRESENT AND SWEEPS CLEAN ENOUGH
HE DARED NOT ASK HER TO ACCOMPANY HIM BACK TO OXFORD WHICH HAD BEEN ONE OF THE PLANS HE HAD FORMED ON THE JOURNEY TO MILTON HER PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION WAS EVIDENTLY TOO COMPLETE FOR HER TO UNDERTAKE ANY SUCH FATIGUE
I WAS KEPT BY THOSE WOMEN IN THE DRAWING ROOM MISSUS SHAW IS ANXIOUS TO GET HOME ON ACCOUNT OF HER DAUGHTER SHE SAYS
THEY PAY ME RENT FOR THE OVEN AND COOKING PLACES AT THE BACK OF THE MILL AND WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR THE NEW DINING ROOM I DON'T WANT IT TO FALL INTO A CHARITY I DON'T WANT DONATIONS ONCE LET IN THE PRINCIPLE
AND ALMOST BREATHLESS BY HIM HE WOULD NOT LEAVE HER EVEN FOR THE DINNER WHICH DIXON HAD PREPARED FOR HIM DOWN STAIRS AND WITH SOBBING HOSPITALITY WOULD FAIN HAVE TEMPTED HIM TO EAT
AND WHEN THEY CAME UP MARGARET WAS STANDING TRYING TO STEADY HER DIZZY SELF AND WHEN SHE SAW HER AUNT SHE WENT FORWARD TO THE ARMS OPEN TO RECEIVE HER
HER MOTHER REALLY TRIED TO SYMPATHISE WITH HER BUT COULD NOT NEITHER TASTE NOR DRESS WERE IN HER LINE OF SUBJECTS AND SHE HEARTILY WISHED THAT FANNY HAD ACCEPTED HER BROTHER'S OFFER
WHO DON'T SEEM TO VALUE THE PRIVILEGE OF THEIR RIGHT NOW IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF FREDERICK CLAIMED HER
AND COOKING A GOOD QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS TOGETHER MUCH MONEY MIGHT BE SAVED AND MUCH COMFORT GAINED SO I SPOKE TO MY FRIEND OR MY ENEMY THE MAN I TOLD YOU OF AND HE FOUND FAULT WITH EVERY DETAIL OF MY PLAN
BUT I SUPPOSE MISSUS THORNTON ASSISTS YOU IN YOUR MARKETING NOT A BIT REPLIED MISTER THORNTON SHE DISAPPROVES OF THE WHOLE PLAN AND NOW WE NEVER MENTION IT TO EACH OTHER BUT I MANAGE PRETTY WELL GETTING IN GREAT STOCKS FROM LIVERPOOL
AND NOT TO INTRUDE MY OWN IDEAS UPON THEM SO ONE DAY TWO OR THREE OF THE MEN MY FRIEND HIGGINS AMONG THEM ASKED ME IF I WOULD NOT COME IN AND TAKE A SNACK IT WAS A VERY BUSY DAY
ALAS AND THAT WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THIS EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN MILTON TO HIM SO UNSPEAKABLY PRECIOUS DOWN TO ITS VERY BITTERNESS WHICH WAS WORTH ALL THE REST OF LIFE'S SWEETNESS WOULD BE REMEMBERED
BUT MORE FREQUENTLY PLANNING HOW SOON SHE COULD GET MARGARET AWAY FROM THAT HORRID PLACE AND BACK INTO THE PLEASANT COMFORTS OF HARLEY STREET OH DEAR SHE SAID TO HER MAID LOOK AT THOSE CHIMNEYS
FIRST COME SOME VILLAS JUST SUFFICIENTLY RETIRED FROM THE ROAD TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN SCARCELY BELONG TO ANY ONE LIABLE TO BE SUMMONED IN A HURRY AT THE CALL OF SUFFERING OR DANGER FROM HIS COMFORTABLE FIRESIDE
BY THAT MEANS I HOPE TO SAVE HIM FROM ONE DEGRADING VICE AT LEAST I WISH I COULD RENDER THE INCENTIVES TO EVERY OTHER EQUALLY INNOXIOUS IN HIS CASE BUT BY SUCH MEANS SAID I YOU WILL NEVER RENDER HIM VIRTUOUS
AND AS I HAVE SAID WHAT WITH VILLAS GREAT WORSTED FACTORIES ROWS OF WORKMEN'S HOUSES WITH HERE AND THERE AN OLD FASHIONED FARMHOUSE AND OUT BUILDINGS IT CAN HARDLY BE CALLED COUNTRY
OR THAT OF HAVING NO TEMPTATIONS TO RESIST IS HE A STRONG MAN THAT OVERCOMES GREAT OBSTACLES AND PERFORMS SURPRISING ACHIEVEMENTS THOUGH BY DINT OF GREAT MUSCULAR EXERTION
THE STANDARDS OF REFERENCE ON ALL POINTS OF MORALITY MANNERS AND EVEN POLITICS AND RELIGION IN SUCH A NEW MANUFACTURING PLACE AS KEIGHLEY IN THE NORTH AND ANY STATELY SLEEPY PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL TOWN IN THE SOUTH
EVERYBODY LAUGHED EXCEPT THE YOUNG WIDOW AND HER SON WELL MISSUS GRAHAM SAID MY MOTHER WIPING THE TEARS OF MERRIMENT FROM HER BRIGHT BLUE EYES
ANY PART OF THE WAY FOR TWO MILES THE ROAD PASSES OVER TOLERABLY LEVEL GROUND DISTANT HILLS ON THE LEFT A BECK FLOWING THROUGH MEADOWS ON THE RIGHT AND FURNISHING WATER POWER AT CERTAIN POINTS
OLD FASHIONED VILLAGE INTO A STILL MORE POPULOUS AND FLOURISHING TOWN IT IS EVIDENT TO THE STRANGER THAT AS THE GABLE ENDED HOUSES WHICH OBTRUDE THEMSELVES CORNER WISE ON THE WIDENING STREET FALL VACANT
WHAT YOU CALL A MAN OF THE WORLD ONE THAT HAS SEEN LIFE AND GLORIES IN HIS EXPERIENCE EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD SO FAR PROFIT BY IT AS TO SOBER DOWN AT LENGTH
THE NAMES OVER THE SHOPS OF WHICH THE ONE JUST GIVEN IS A SAMPLE SEEM STRANGE EVEN TO AN INHABITANT OF THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTY AND HAVE A PECULIAR SMACK AND FLAVOUR OF THE PLACE
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PLACE TELLS OF THE MOST DAINTY ORDER THE MOST EXQUISITE CLEANLINESS THE DOOR STEPS ARE SPOTLESS THE SMALL OLD FASHIONED WINDOW PANES GLITTER LIKE LOOKING GLASS
THE TOWN OF KEIGHLEY NEVER QUITE MELTS INTO COUNTRY ON THE ROAD TO HAWORTH ALTHOUGH THE HOUSES BECOME MORE SPARSE AS THE TRAVELLER JOURNEYS UPWARDS TO THE GREY ROUND HILLS THAT SEEM TO BOUND HIS JOURNEY IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION
A B SHE DIED AGED TWENTY SEVEN YEARS
AS THE ENTRANCE TO THIS FROM THE ROAD IS AT THE SIDE THE PATH GOES ROUND THE CORNER INTO THE LITTLE PLOT OF GROUND UNDERNEATH THE WINDOWS IS A NARROW FLOWER BORDER CAREFULLY TENDED IN DAYS OF YORE
REPLIED SHE AS SHE SHOOK HANDS WITH ROSE YOU MUST BRING YOUR SISTER TO SEE ME SOME FINE DAY AND I'LL LISTEN AS PATIENTLY AS YOU COULD WISH TO WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO SAY
TO THE FACTORIES BUILT ON ITS BANKS THE AIR IS DIM AND LIGHTLESS WITH THE SMOKE FROM ALL THESE HABITATIONS AND PLACES OF BUSINESS THE SOIL IN THE VALLEY OR BOTTOM TO USE THE LOCAL TERM IS RICH
NOR WOULD I WATCH AND GUARD HER TILL DEPRIVED OF SELF RESPECT AND SELF RELIANCE SHE LOST THE POWER OR THE WILL TO WATCH AND GUARD HERSELF AND AS FOR MY SON
SHE LAUGHINGLY TURNED ROUND AND HELD OUT HER HAND I GAVE IT A SPITEFUL SQUEEZE
WHERE THOUGHT AND SUFFERING SEEM EQUALLY TO HAVE STAMPED THEIR IMPRESS
IT WAS A LITTLE CHILD SEATED ON THE GRASS WITH ITS LAP FULL OF FLOWERS THE TINY FEATURES AND LARGE BLUE EYES SMILING THROUGH A SHOCK OF LIGHT BROWN CURLS
BUT INDEED YOU ARE NOT AND IF YOU PERSIST IN THE ATTEMPT BELIEVE ME YOU WILL BITTERLY REPENT IT WHEN THE MISCHIEF IS DONE I AM TO SEND HIM TO SCHOOL I SUPPOSE TO LEARN TO DESPISE HIS MOTHER'S AUTHORITY AND AFFECTION
AND NOT EVEN SHELTERED FROM THE SHOCK OF THE TEMPEST GRANTED BUT WOULD YOU USE THE SAME ARGUMENT WITH REGARD TO A GIRL CERTAINLY NOT
AND DILIGENT AND ACTIVE HABITS IN THE WOMEN BUT THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE ARE HARD AND THEIR TONES DISCORDANT PROMISING LITTLE OF THE MUSICAL TASTE THAT DISTINGUISHES THE DISTRICT AND WHICH HAS ALREADY FURNISHED A CARRODUS TO THE MUSICAL WORLD
I ONLY SAY THAT IT IS BETTER TO ARM AND STRENGTHEN YOUR HERO THAN TO DISARM AND ENFEEBLE THE FOE AND IF YOU WERE TO REAR AN OAK SAPLING IN A HOTHOUSE TENDING IT CAREFULLY NIGHT AND DAY AND SHIELDING IT FROM EVERY BREATH OF WIND
ONLY SOME ONE COME ABOUT THE PICTURES SAID SHE IN APOLOGY FOR HER ABRUPT DEPARTURE I TOLD HIM TO WAIT
AND ILLIMITABLE BARRIER ACCORDING TO THE MOOD OF MIND IN WHICH THE SPECTATOR MAY BE FOR A SHORT DISTANCE THE ROAD APPEARS TO TURN AWAY FROM HAWORTH AS IT WINDS ROUND THE BASE OF THE SHOULDER OF A HILL
BUT IMMEDIATELY I WAS SENSIBLE OF HAVING COMMITTED AN ACT OF IMPERTINENCE IN SO DOING FOR SHE COLOURED AND HESITATED BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE FRANKNESS SHE REPLIED BECAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS
SAID I SULKILY RESIGNING THE PICTURE INTO HER HANDS FOR WITHOUT A GRAIN OF CEREMONY SHE TOOK IT FROM ME AND QUICKLY RESTORING IT TO THE DARK CORNER WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
AND I THINK IN FUTURE I MUST CONTRIVE TO BRING HIM WITH ME OR STAY AT HOME IS HE SO MISCHIEVOUS ASKED MY MOTHER CONSIDERABLY SHOCKED NO REPLIED THE LADY
SAYING WITH A SOFT VOICE AND BY NO MEANS A DISAGREEABLE SMILE NOT THE SUN GO DOWN UPON YOUR WRATH MISTER MARKHAM I'M SORRY I OFFENDED YOU BY MY ABRUPTNESS
WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT MY REAL DISPOSITION AND PRINCIPLES SHE WAS EVIDENTLY PREJUDICED AGAINST ME AND SEEMED BENT UPON SHOWING ME THAT HER OPINIONS RESPECTING ME ON EVERY PARTICULAR FELL FAR BELOW THOSE I ENTERTAINED OF MYSELF
APPARENTLY IMMERSED IN THE PERUSAL OF A VOLUME OF THE FARMER'S MAGAZINE
THE BRIGHT BLUE EYES REGARDED THE SPECTATOR WITH A KIND OF LURKING DROLLERY YOU ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE THEM WINK THE LIPS A LITTLE TOO VOLUPTUOUSLY FULL SEEMED READY TO BREAK INTO A SMILE
AND A DULL BECLOUDED SKY ABOVE YOU SEE THERE IS A SAD DEARTH OF SUBJECTS OBSERVED THE FAIR ARTIST I TOOK THE OLD HALL ONCE ON A MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND I SUPPOSE I MUST TAKE IT AGAIN ON A SNOWY WINTER'S DAY
NEVER MIND ARTHUR SAID HIS MAMMA MISSUS MARKHAM THINKS IT WILL DO YOU GOOD AS YOU WERE TIRED WITH YOUR WALK BUT SHE WILL NOT OBLIGE YOU TO TAKE IT
LIKE THE REST OF MANKIND UNLESS I TAKE CARE TO PREVENT IT YOU ARE VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO US ALL I OBSERVED I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU I SPEAK OF THOSE I DO KNOW
AND CONTEST THE RIGHT OF THE VICAR OF BRADFORD TO NOMINATE A CURATE AT HAWORTH I HAVE GIVEN THIS EXTRACT IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE IMAGINARY GROUNDWORK OF A COMMOTION WHICH TOOK PLACE IN HAWORTH ABOUT FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS AGO
MAMMA SENDS ALL HER PICTURES TO LONDON SAID ARTHUR AND SOMEBODY SELLS THEM FOR HER THERE AND SENDS US THE MONEY IN LOOKING ROUND UPON THE OTHER PIECES I REMARKED A PRETTY SKETCH OF LINDEN HOPE FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL
AND A FEW FINISHED PAINTINGS MOSTLY OF LANDSCAPES AND FIGURES I MUST MAKE YOU WELCOME TO MY STUDIO SAID MISSUS GRAHAM
AND HE IS TOO MERCURIAL TO BE TIED TO AN ELDERLY WOMAN BUT YOU LEFT HIM TO COME TO CHURCH
AND THE GRAVEYARD RISES ABOVE THE CHURCH AND IS TERRIBLY FULL OF UPRIGHT TOMBSTONES THE CHAPEL OR CHURCH CLAIMS GREATER ANTIQUITY THAN ANY OTHER IN THAT PART OF THE KINGDOM BUT THERE IS NO APPEARANCE OF THIS IN THE EXTERNAL ASPECT
YES OF COURSE REPLIED I DETERMINED TO BE AS PROVOKING AS HERSELF FOR WHEN A LADY DOES CONSENT TO LISTEN TO AN ARGUMENT AGAINST HER OWN OPINIONS SHE IS ALWAYS PREDETERMINED TO WITHSTAND IT TO LISTEN ONLY WITH HER BODILY EARS
THAT WAS LYING AT MY FEET ON LOOKING UP I BEHELD HIM STANDING ABOUT TWO YARDS OFF WITH HIS CLEAR BLUE EYES WISTFULLY GAZING ON THE DOG TRANSFIXED TO THE SPOT
NEARLY EVERY DWELLING SEEMS DEVOTED TO SOME BRANCH OF COMMERCE IN PASSING HASTILY THROUGH THE TOWN ONE HARDLY PERCEIVES WHERE THE NECESSARY LAWYER AND DOCTOR CAN LIVE
BUT BY A TIMID DISINCLINATION TO APPROACH ITS MASTER A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT HOWEVER INDUCED HIM TO COME FORWARD THE CHILD THOUGH SHY WAS NOT SULLEN IN A MINUTE HE WAS KNEELING ON THE CARPET
AND THE HORSE BREATHES MORE EASILY AS THEY PASS INTO THE QUITE LITTLE BY STREET THAT LEADS TO HAWORTH PARSONAGE THE CHURCHYARD IS ON ONE SIDE OF THIS LANE THE SCHOOL HOUSE AND THE SEXTON'S DWELLING WHERE THE CURATES FORMERLY LODGED
OF THE PRESENT EDIFICE UNLESS IT BE IN THE TWO EASTERN WINDOWS WHICH REMAIN UNMODERNIZED AND IN THE LOWER PART OF THE STEEPLE
OH NO BUT IF YOU WOULD HAVE A BOY TO DESPISE HIS MOTHER
YOU HAVE ALMOST COMPLETED YOUR PAINTING SAID I APPROACHING TO OBSERVE IT MORE CLOSELY AND SURVEYING IT WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT THAN I CARED TO EXPRESS
BOTH FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT WHEN I HAVE DONE ALL I CAN TO RENDER VICE AS UNINVITING TO HIM AS IT IS ABOMINABLE IN ITS OWN NATURE I MYSELF HAVE HAD INDEED BUT FEW INCENTIVES TO WHAT THE WORLD CALLS VICE
WITH A TABLE BESIDE IT COVERED WITH ROLLS OF CANVAS BOTTLES OF OIL AND VARNISH
OR ANYTHING CONNECTED THEREWITH IT MUST BE EITHER THAT YOU THINK SHE IS ESSENTIALLY SO VICIOUS OR SO FEEBLE MINDED THAT SHE CANNOT WITHSTAND TEMPTATION AND THOUGH SHE MAY BE PURE AND INNOCENT AS LONG AS SHE IS KEPT IN IGNORANCE AND RESTRAINT
A FEW MORE TOUCHES IN THE FOREGROUND WILL FINISH IT I SHOULD THINK BUT WHY HAVE YOU CALLED IT FERNLEY MANOR CUMBERLAND INSTEAD OF WILDFELL HALL SHIRE I ASKED ALLUDING TO THE NAME SHE HAD TRACED IN SMALL CHARACTERS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CANVAS
THE REST OF THE GROUND IS OCCUPIED BY A SQUARE GRASS PLOT AND A GRAVEL WALK THE HOUSE IS OF GREY STONE TWO STORIES HIGH HEAVILY ROOFED WITH FLAGS
BUT AS THE ROAD BEGINS TO ASCEND THE VEGETATION BECOMES POORER IT DOES NOT FLOURISH IT MERELY EXISTS AND INSTEAD OF TREES THERE ARE ONLY BUSHES AND SHRUBS ABOUT THE DWELLINGS
YET THE ASPECT OF KEIGHLEY PROMISES WELL FOR FUTURE STATELINESS IF NOT PICTURESQUENESS GREY STONE ABOUNDS AND THE ROWS OF HOUSES BUILT OF IT HAVE A KIND OF SOLID GRANDEUR
ROSE NOW AT A HINT FROM MY MOTHER PRODUCED A DECANTER OF WINE WITH ACCOMPANIMENTS OF GLASSES AND CAKE FROM THE CUPBOARD AND THE OAK SIDEBOARD AND THE REFRESHMENT WAS DULY PRESENTED TO THE GUESTS
BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE LESS REMORSE IN TELLING YOU AT THE END OF THE DISCOURSE THAT I PRESERVE MY OWN OPINION PRECISELY THE SAME AS AT THE BEGINNING AS WOULD BE THE CASE I AM PERSUADED WITH REGARD TO EITHER LOGICIAN
THE LAWYER THE DOCTOR AND THE CLERGYMAN LIVE AT HAND AND HARDLY IN THE SUBURBS WITH A SCREEN OF SHRUBS FOR CONCEALMENT IN A TOWN ONE DOES NOT LOOK FOR VIVID COLOURING
SAID I OBSERVING HER RISE AND BEGIN TO TAKE LEAVE OF MY MOTHER YOU MAY HAVE AS MANY WORDS AS YOU PLEASE ONLY I CAN'T STAY TO HEAR THEM NO THAT IS THE WAY YOU HEAR JUST AS MUCH OF AN ARGUMENT AS YOU PLEASE AND THE REST MAY BE SPOKEN TO THE WIND
WHO ENTERTAINED AN IDEA THAT THE MYSTERIOUS OCCUPANT OF WILDFELL HALL WOULD WHOLLY DISREGARD THE COMMON OBSERVANCES OF CIVILIZED LIFE IN WHICH OPINION SHE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE WILSONS WHO TESTIFIED THAT NEITHER THEIR CALL
SO LITTLE APPEARANCE IS THERE OF ANY DWELLINGS OF THE PROFESSIONAL MIDDLE CLASS SUCH AS ABOUND IN OUR OLD CATHEDRAL TOWNS IN FACT NOTHING CAN BE MORE OPPOSED THAN THE STATE OF SOCIETY THE MODES OF THINKING
BUT I WAS IN NO HUMOUR FOR JESTING I CARELESSLY TURNED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD LOOKING OUT UPON THE DESOLATE GARDEN LEAVING HER TO TALK TO ROSE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
THE WARMLY TINTED CHEEKS WERE EMBELLISHED WITH A LUXURIANT GROWTH OF REDDISH WHISKERS WHILE THE BRIGHT CHESTNUT HAIR CLUSTERING IN ABUNDANT WAVY CURLS TRESPASSED TOO MUCH UPON THE FOREHEAD AND SEEMED TO
AND TELL YOU WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO AND ALL ABOUT IT AND I DON'T DOUBT HE'LL BE ABLE TO CONVINCE YOU IN A MINUTE NO OCCASION TO TROUBLE THE VICAR SAID MISSUS GRAHAM GLANCING AT ME
IF YOU PERSIST IN I THINK IT A VERY EXCELLENT PLAN INTERRUPTED MISSUS GRAHAM WITH IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY
YES BUT THE SUREST MEANS WILL BE TO ENDEAVOUR TO FORTIFY HIM AGAINST TEMPTATION NOT TO REMOVE IT OUT OF HIS WAY I WILL DO BOTH MISTER MARKHAM GOD KNOWS HE WILL HAVE TEMPTATIONS ENOUGH TO ASSAIL HIM
TO TEACH HER HOW TO SIN IS AT ONCE TO MAKE HER A SINNER AND THE GREATER HER KNOWLEDGE THE WIDER HER LIBERTY THE DEEPER WILL BE HER DEPRAVITY WHEREAS IN THE NOBLER SEX THERE IS A NATURAL TENDENCY TO GOODNESS
ORATE PRO BONO STATU EUTEST TOD NOW EVERY ANTIQUARY KNOWS THAT THE FORMULA OF PRAYER BONO STATU ALWAYS REFERS TO THE LIVING I SUSPECT THIS SINGULAR CHRISTIAN NAME
CONNECTED WITH THEIR UNIFORM AND ENDURING LINES THE FRAME WORK OF THE DOORS AND THE LINTELS OF THE WINDOWS EVEN IN THE SMALLEST DWELLINGS ARE MADE OF BLOCKS OF STONE
THEN YOU DON'T INTEND TO KEEP THE PICTURE SAID I ANXIOUS TO SAY ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT NO
IS IT THAT YOU THINK SHE HAS NO VIRTUE ASSUREDLY NOT WELL BUT YOU AFFIRM THAT VIRTUE IS ONLY ELICITED BY TEMPTATION AND YOU THINK THAT A WOMAN CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE EXPOSED TO TEMPTATION OR TOO LITTLE ACQUAINTED WITH VICE
BY WAY OF MEDICINE WHEN HE WAS SICK
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THERE EXISTED ON THIS GROUND A FIELD KIRK OR ORATORY IN THE EARLIEST TIMES
NOR THE MILLWARDS HAD BEEN RETURNED AS YET NOW HOWEVER THE CAUSE OF THAT OMISSION WAS EXPLAINED
THAT IS TO SAY BEFORE THE PREACHING OF CHRISTIANITY IN NORTHUMBRIA
NEVERTHELESS I SURVEYED IT WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST THERE WAS A CERTAIN INDIVIDUALITY IN THE FEATURES AND EXPRESSION THAT STAMPED IT AT ONCE A SUCCESSFUL LIKENESS
BUT SHE SEEMED TO THINK ENOUGH HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT AND ABRUPTLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION JUST AS I THOUGHT SAID I TO MYSELF THE LADY'S TEMPER IS NONE OF THE MILDEST NOTWITHSTANDING HER SWEET PALE FACE AND LOFTY BROW
YOU MAY OCCASION REMARKS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TRAVEL ON HIS CONCERNS YOU ARE RIGHT HUMPHREY I MUST NOT DO THINGS BY HALVES AND UNLESS I WEAR THE HAT I MIGHT BE SUSPECTED I DOUBT IF THE INTENDANT WEARS IT FOR ANY OTHER REASON SAID HUMPHREY
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN EDWARD SAID EDITH SCOLD PABLO HE HAS BEEN ILL TREATING MY POOR CAT HE IS A CRUEL BOY PABLO LAUGHED SEE EDWARD HE'S LAUGHING PUT HIM IN THE PITFALL AGAIN
SAID PATIENCE WITH A LITTLE MOCK CEREMONY EDWARD DID SO WITHOUT REPLYING AND WAS USHERED INTO A LARGE AIRY ROOM VERY NEATLY FURNISHED THIS IS YOUR FUTURE LODGING SAID PATIENCE I HOPE YOU WILL LIKE IT
AT ALL EVENTS I WILL NOT GO TO THE HEIGHT OF THE FASHION REPLIED EDWARD LAUGHING SOME OF THE HATS ARE NOT QUITE SO TALL AS THE OTHERS HERE IS THE SHOP FOR THE HAT AND FOR THE SWORD BELT EDWARD CHOSE A HAT AND A PLAIN SWORD BELT
EDWARD REMAINED AT THE COTTAGE EXPECTING TO BEAR SOME MESSAGE FROM THE INTENDANT HE WAS RIGHT IN HIS CONJECTURE FOR ON THE THIRD DAY OSWALD PARTRIDGE CAME OVER TO SAY THAT THE INTENDANT WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE HIM IF HE COULD MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO GO OVER
AFTER NO VICTUALS FOR THREE DAYS I SHOULD HOPE NOT REPLIED HUMPHREY ALTHOUGH I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO SEVERELY PUNISHED AND I HOPE PABLO YOU WILL NEVER STEAL ANY MORE WHY STEAL ANY MORE REPLIED PABLO
INDEED I OUGHT TO FEEL GRATEFUL TO HER FOR IF SHE HAD NOT GIVEN ME SO BAD A BED THAT NIGHT I NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO COMFORTABLY LODGED AS IT IS PROPOSED THAT I SHALL BE NOW I HOPE YOU ARE HUNGRY EDWARD SAID CLARA DINNER IS ALMOST READY
WHILE ALL THESE PURCHASES ON THE PART OF EDWARD AND MANY OTHERS BY HUMPHREY SUCH AS NAILS SAWS TOOLS AND VARIOUS ARTICLES WHICH ALICE REQUIRED FOR THE HOUSEHOLD WERE GATHERED TOGETHER THE LANDLORD HAD SENT OUT TO INQUIRE FOR THE GOATS
AND HE SAID THAT IF YOU ACCEPTED AN OFFER HE HAD MADE YOU AND CAME OVER HERE WE SHOULD NOT WANT VENISON SO IT IS CLEAR THAT HE DOES NOT EXPECT YOU TO HAVE YOUR PEN ALWAYS IN YOUR HAND I AM GLAD TO HEAR THAT REPLIED EDWARD DEPEND UPON IT HIS OWN TABLE
BY THIS CONVERSATION IT WILL APPEAR TO THE READER THAT THEY HAD BEEN TRYING TO IMPRESS PABLO WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND SUCH WAS THE CASE EDITH HAVING BEEN ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE IN THE ENDEAVOR
I CERTAINLY DO NOT THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A LIBERTY IN A PERSON AFTER BEING WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ME TO CALL ME PATIENCE REPLIED SHE ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT PERSON LIVES IN THE HOUSE WITH US EATS AND ASSOCIATES WITH US AS ONE OF THE FAMILY
THAT I COULD GET ON BY MYSELF BUT STILL EDWARD YOU KNOW WE CAN NOT TELL WHAT A DAY MAY BRING FORTH AND I MIGHT FALL SICK OR SOMETHING HAPPEN WHICH MIGHT PREVENT MY ATTENDING TO ANY THING AND THEN WITHOUT YOU OR PABLO EVERY THING MIGHT HAVE GONE TO RACK AND RUIN
AND SO YOU MAY TELL THE INTENDANT I WILL AND THAT WILL BE AN EXCUSE FOR HIM TO SEND SOME OVER IF HE PLEASES INDEED AS I KNOW I SHALL BE PERMITTED TO GO OUT WITH OSWALD IT WILL BE HARD IF A STRAY BUCK DOES NOT FIND ITS WAY TO THE COTTAGE
TO TAKE UP HIS ABODE WITH THEM BILLY WAS FRESH AND CANTERED GAYLY ALONG SO THAT EDWARD WAS BACK EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND ONCE MORE WELCOMED BY HIS HOUSEHOLD HE STATED TO HUMPHREY ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED
AT ALL EVENTS SHALL BE WELL SUPPLIED IS NOT THAT FELLOW CORBOULD WHO IS LEANING AGAINST THE WALL YES HE IS TO BE DISCHARGED AS HE CAN NOT WALK WELL AND THE SURGEON SAYS HE WILL ALWAYS LIMP
MOST OF THEM ARE MEN WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE ARMY AND I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN APPOINTED TO THESE SITUATIONS TO GET RID OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE TROUBLESOME AND THEY ARE ANY THING BUT GOOD CHARACTERS THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WE KILL BUT FEW DEER
WHICH I CAN NOT DO WHILE I AM SECLUDED IN THE FOREST AND DEPEND UPON IT WE SHALL HAVE STIRRING NEWS I SUPPOSE YOU THINK THAT THE KING WILL COME OVER REPLIED OSWALD I FEEL CERTAIN OF IT OSWALD
HUMPHREY WAS OFF THE NEXT MORNING WITH PABLO AT AN EARLY HOUR TO MEET THE FARMER OF WHOM HE HAD PURCHASED THE GOATS AND KIDS HE FOUND THEM PUNCTUAL TO THE TIME AT THE PLACE AGREED UPON AND BEING SATISFIED WITH THE LOT
WHICH WOULD BE ONLY THREE MILES FROM THE PLACE AGREED UPON HAVING SETTLED THAT SATISFACTORILY HE RETURNED TO EDWARD WHO WAS ALL READY AND THEY WENT BACK HOME WE HAVE DIPPED SOMEWHAT INTO THE BAG TO DAY EDWARD SAID HUMPHREY BUT THE MONEY IS WELL SPENT
I SHOULD THINK BUT HE IS VERY CLOSE THE CONVERSATION THEN CHANGED AND AFTER A RIDE OF EIGHT HOURS THEY ARRIVED AT THE INTENDANT'S HOUSE EDWARD GAVE BILLY INTO OSWALD'S CHARGE AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
WHAT IS YOUR REPLY I AM VERY THANKFUL TO YOU FOR THE OFFER SIR REPLIED EDWARD AND WILL ACCEPT IT IF YOU THINK THAT I AM FITTING FOR IT
THEY ARE FOND OF FLOWERS AND WILL BE MUCH PLEASED WITH POSSESSING ANY YOU SLEEP HERE TO NIGHT I THINK MY FATHER SAID INQUIRED PATIENCE HE DID MAKE THE PROPOSAL AND I SHALL GLADLY AVAIL MYSELF OF IT AS I AM NOT TO TRUST TO PHOEBE'S IDEAS OF COMFORT THIS TIME
AND YOU HAVE TWO COW CALVES BRINGING UP THAT IS VERY TRUE BUT I DO NOT INTEND TO HAVE GOATS FOR THEIR MILK BUT SIMPLY FOR EATING IN LIEU OF MUTTON SHEEP I CAN NOT MANAGE BUT GOATS WITH A LITTLE HAY IN WINTER WILL DO WELL
I AM NOT YET EIGHTEEN CLARA SO THAT I CAN HARDLY BE CALLED A MAN WHY YOU ARE AS TALL AS MISTER HEATHERSTONE YES I BELIEVE I AM AND CAN'T YOU DO EVERY THING THAT A MAN CAN DO I REALLY DON'T KNOW
EDWARD REMAINED IN CONVERSATION WITH THE INTENDANT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN WAS CONDUCTED BY HIM TO HIS ROOM WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN SHOWN TO HIM BY PATIENCE EDWARD DID NOT SLEEP MUCH THAT NIGHT THE NOVELTY OF HIS SITUATION THE NOVELTY OF HIS PROSPECTS
I WILL THIS TIME BUT IF HE KICKS PUSSY AGAIN HE MUST BE PUT IN THE PITFALL MIND THAT PABLO YES MISSY EDITH I GO INTO PITFALL AND THEN YOU CRY AND ASK MASTER EDWARD TO TAKE ME OUT
FOR WE ARE NOT A LITTLE HUNGRY I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE SOME RABBIT STEW ON THE FIRE HUMPHREY ALL READY FOR YOU AND YOU WILL FIND IT VERY GOOD NOTHING I LIKE BETTER MY DEAR GIRL PABLO WON'T THANK ME FOR BRINGING THIS HOME CONTINUED HUMPHREY
FIRST RECOLLECT MYSELF IN THAT COUNTRY DO YOU RECOLLECT YOUR FATHER NO NEVER SEE HIM DID YOUR MOTHER NEVER TALK ABOUT HIM CALL HER MOTHER BUT THINK NO MOTHER AT ALL CUSTOM
THAT ALTHOUGH I STATED THAT THE APARTMENTS AT ARNWOOD WERE ON A GRANDER SCALE I NEVER SAID THAT I HAD EVER BEEN A POSSESSOR OF ONE OF THEM PATIENCE SMILED AND MADE NO REPLY NOW THAT YOU KNOW YOUR WAY TO YOUR APARTMENT MASTER ARMITAGE
YOU CAN PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A SUIT AT LYMINGTON I WILL FURNISH YOU THE MEANS I THANK YOU SIR I HAVE MEANS MUCH MORE THAN SUFFICIENT REPLIED EDWARD ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE SO WEALTHY AS LITTLE CLARA APPEARED TO BE
SAID HUMPHREY YOUR DRESS AS I CONSIDER IS A SORT OF DISGRACE TO A CAVALIER BORN AND THE HEIR OF ARNWOOD WHY NOT THEREFORE TAKE ITS HAT AS WELL AS SECRETARY TO THE INTENDANT YOU SHOULD DRESS LIKE HIM IF NOT
PAID THE FARMER HIS MONEY AND DROVE THEM HOME THROUGH THE FOREST GOAT VERY GOOD KID BETTER ALWAYS EAT KID IN SPAIN SAID PABLO WERE YOU BORN IN SPAIN PABLO NOT SURE BUT I THINK SO
THAT EVERY THING MAY BE READY I SUPPOSE SIR I MUST CHANGE MY ATTIRE REPLIED EDWARD LOOKING AT HIS FORESTER'S DRESS THAT WILL HARDLY ACCORD WITH THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY
CERTAINLY WHEN WE THINK HOW WE WERE LEFT BY THE DEATH OF OLD JACOB TO OUR OWN RESOURCES WE HAVE MUCH TO THANK GOD FOR IN HAVING GOT ON SO WELL I AGREE WITH YOU AND ALSO THAT IT HAS PLEASED HEAVEN TO GRANT US ALL SUCH GOOD HEALTH
ALMOST AS IF YOU WERE AT THE COTTAGE YOU DO NOT RETURN TILL TO MORROW HOW DID YOU COME OVER I RODE THE PONY BILLY MISTRESS PATIENCE
YOUR HAVING CAUGHT PABLO AS YOU DID HUMPHREY FOR I DO NOT WELL KNOW HOW I COULD HAVE LEFT YOU IF YOU HAD NOT AT ALL EVENTS I CAN DO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT YOU THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE REPLIED HUMPHREY ALTHOUGH I THINK NOW
OH YES I HAVE HEARD MY FATHER SPEAK OF IT SAID CLARA WITH THE TEARS STARTING IN HER EYES AT HIS MEMORY YES IT WAS BURNED DOWN AND ALL THE CHILDREN BURNED TO DEATH SO THEY SAY CLARA
I CAN WEAR THAT WITH A GUN IN MY HAND BUT NOT WITH A PEN SO I MUST GO TO LYMINGTON AND SEE WHAT A TAILOR CAN DO FOR ME YOU WILL FEEL AS STRANGE IN A SECRETARY'S DRESS AS I DID IN BOYS CLOTHES SAID CLARA PERHAPS I MAY SAID EDWARD
AND HIS SPECULATIONS THEREON KEPT HIM AWAKE TILL NEAR MORNING HE WAS HOWEVER UP IN GOOD TIME AND HAVING ASSISTED AT THE MORNING PRAYERS AND AFTERWARD EATEN A MOST SUBSTANTIAL BREAKFAST
GOING TO THE KENNEL AND EXAMINING THE DOGS AND TALKING OF MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE CHASE I HAVE NOT TWO MEN THAT CAN STALK A DEER OBSERVED OSWALD THE MEN APPOINTED HERE
PLENTY VICTUALS LIKE ENGLAND BEST
AND TEN MORE FEMALE KIDS WHICH HAD JUST BEEN WEANED THE MAN ENGAGED TO DRIVE THEM FROM LYMINGTON AS FAR AS THE ROAD WENT INTO THE FOREST ON THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN HUMPHREY WOULD MEET THEM PAY HIM HIS MONEY AND DRIVE THEM TO THE COTTAGE
THAT YOU MUST FORGIVE THEM WHO BEHAVE ILL TO YOU YES MISSY EDITH YOU TELL ME ALL THAT AND SO I DO I FORGIVE PUSSY CAUSE SHE BITE ME BUT I KICK HER FOR IT THAT'S NOT FORGIVENESS IS IT EDWARD
I VERY OFTEN SHALL SEND YOU TO LONDON INSTEAD OF GOING MYSELF AND TO THAT I PRESUME YOU WILL HAVE NO OBJECTION CERTAINLY NONE SIR WELL THEN IT IS NO USE SAYING ANY MORE JUST NOW YOU WILL HAVE A CHAMBER IN THIS HOUSE
AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE READ HIS THOUGHTS EDWARD SMILED AND SAID DO YOU DOUBT WHAT I SAY NO INDEED SAID SHE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU WERE AT THE COTTAGE AT THE TIME BUT I WAS THINKING THAT IF THE APARTMENTS AT ARNWOOD WERE MORE SPLENDID
AND YOU WILL LIVE WITH ME AND AT MY TABLE ALTOGETHER NEITHER SHALL I SAY ANY THING JUST NOW ABOUT REMUNERATION AS I AM CONVINCED THAT YOU WILL BE SATISFIED ALL THAT I REQUIRE NOW IS TO KNOW THE DAY THAT YOU WILL COME
ALICE AND EDITH DID NOT QUITE SO MUCH APPROVE OF IT AND A FEW TEARS WERE SHED AT THE IDEA OF EDWARD LEAVING THE COTTAGE THE NEXT DAY EDWARD AND HUMPHREY SET OFF FOR LYMINGTON WITH BILLY IN THE CART DO YOU KNOW EDWARD SAID HUMPHREY
BUT I CERTAINLY SHALL ALWAYS TRY SO TO DO WELL THEN YOU MUST BE A MAN WELL CLARA IF IT PLEASES YOU I WILL BE A MAN HERE COMES MISTER HEATHERSTONE SO I KNOW DINNER IS READY IS IT NOT SIR

YOU HAVE BEEN USED TO BETTER AND TO WORSE AND THEREFORE WILL I TRUST BE CONTENT WITH THESE I TRUST I HAVE SHOWN NO SIGNS OF DISCONTENT I SHOULD INDEED BE DIFFICULT TO PLEASE IF AN APARTMENT LIKE THIS DID NOT SUIT ME BESIDES ALLOW ME TO OBSERVE
HUMPHREY LEFT EDWARD TO PUT AWAY THESE IN THE CART WHILE HE WENT OUT A SECOND TIME TO SEE THE GOATS HE MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE MAN WHO HAD THEM FOR SALE FOR A MALE AND THREE FEMALES WITH TWO KIDS EACH AT THEIR SIDES
ALTHOUGH HE FELT THAT SUCH WOULD NOT BE THE CASE HAVING BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO MUCH BETTER CLOTHES WHEN AT ARNWOOD THAN WHAT WERE USUALLY WORN BY SECRETARIES AND THIS REMEMBRANCE BROUGHT BACK ARNWOOD IN ITS TRAIN AND EDWARD BECAME SILENT AND PENSIVE
PATIENCE OBSERVED IT AND AFTER A TIME SAID YOU WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH OVER YOUR SISTERS MISTER ARMITAGE
I CAN BUT GIVE IT A TRIAL AND LEAVE IF I FIND IT TOO ARDUOUS OR TOO IRKSOME TOO ARDUOUS IT SHALL NOT BE THAT SHALL BE MY CONCERN AND TOO IRKSOME I HOPE YOU WILL NOT FIND IT
BY TELLING HER THAT YOU ARE TO BECOME A RESIDENT WITH US YOU WILL OF COURSE DINE WITH US TO DAY AND SLEEP HERE TO NIGHT MISTER HEATHERSTONE THEN OPENED THE DOOR AND SAYING TO HIS DAUGHTER PATIENCE MY DEAR I LEAVE YOU TO ENTERTAIN EDWARD ARMITAGE
WHILE RESUMING WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FAVOURITE MEANS OF WARRING UPON HIS ENEMIES JIMMY COMMENCED HURLING MASSES OF STONE AT THE COMING FOES CHECKED AS THEY WERE THOUGH IT WAS ONLY FOR A
THE NOISE WAS NOT SO GREAT THOUGH NOW THAT WE COULD NOT TALK AND AFTER RECOVERING FROM THE APPALLING SHOCK OF THE NEW DANGER WE HAD TIME TO LOOK AROUND OUR FIRST THOUGHT WAS
WHICH DARTED AND QUIVERED IN THE GORGE AT TIMES SEEMING TO LICK THE WALLS AT OTHERS PLUNGING INTO THE RUSHING SEETHING STREAM INTO WHICH THE RAIN POURED IN VERY CATARACTS DOWN THE ROCKY SIDES
IT SEEMED A STRANGE TIME AFTER PASSING THROUGH SUCH A SERIES OF DANGERS AFTER ESCAPING BY SO LITTLE FROM BEING SWEPT AWAY AND WHILE IN TERRIBLE DANGER FROM THE SWIFTLY RISING WATERS
ALL OVER BIG COUNTRY WATER ALL GONE JIMMY CUNNING ARTFUL NOT MEAN DIE DIS TIME BUNYIP NOT GOT NUFF WATER GIVE JIMMY SOMETHING EAT
WAITING FOR THE TIME WHEN WE SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY IN SPITE OF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT AT MOST IN AN HOUR THE LEDGE WOULD BE COVERED

NO KNOW WHAT UM SAY CRIED THE BLACK IMPATIENTLY CAN'T GET AWAY I SAID NO GET WAY WAITUM WAITUM JIMMY JIMMY SEE
FALLING OVER EACH OTHER IN THEIR HASTE AND WE SAW TWO THRUST INTO THE SWIFT RIVER
BUT I COULD NOT HELP IT JACK'S ASPECT AS HE SAT THERE COOLLY VERY COOLLY CLOTHED IN HIS TROUSERS ALONE WAS SO LUDICROUS THAT I BURST OUT LAUGHING WHEN JIMMY JOINED IN AND BEGAN TO DANCE WITH DELIGHT
GREAT TUPID GO DIE WHEN QUITE WELL TANK YOU MASS JOE JIMMY BLACK FELLOW WON'T DIE YET MASS JOE HAB BIG SWIM LONG O JIMMY
FOR MANY AGES AFTER EVERY STORM AND
WITH A WONDERFUL DISPLAY OF ACTIVITY WHICH RESULTED MERELY IN HIS SLIPPING BACK THEN HE TRIED ELSEWHERE IN TWO PLACES BUT WITH THE SAME RESULT AND AFTER A FEW MORE TRIALS
FIRST HE PULLED OFF HIS BOOTS THEN HIS STOCKINGS WHICH HE TUCKED METHODICALLY ALONG WITH HIS GARTERS INSIDE HIS BOOTS THIS DONE HE TOOK OFF HIS JACKET FOLDED IT CAREFULLY AND HIS SHIRT FOLLOWED
AND CLAMBER BEYOND THE REACH OF THE RUSHING TORRENT BUT NO
THEN BY DEGREES IT CREPT ON AND ON TILL I WAS STANDING WITH IT REACHING MY HIPS A FEARFUL SILENCE NOW ENSUED AND THE THOUGHT CAME UPON ME
THE SCOURING OF THE ROCKS MUST HAVE BEEN INCESSANT THEN MY THOUGHTS CAME BACK TO OUR HORRIBLE POSITION
HE CAME TO ME AND STOOD RUBBING THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AS IF PUZZLED
FOR A FRESH WAVE THE RESULT PROBABLY OF SOME PORTION OF THE FLOOD THAT HAD BEEN DAMMED UP HIGHER ON THE RIVER COURSE
THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL WHO MADE
WHERE WE STOOD WITH THE WATER RISING STILL HIGHER
OF ALL TIMES WAS THE HOUR FOR THAT SO WE WORKED ON WITH MANY A FURTIVE GLANCE AT THE WATER WHICH KEPT ON ENCROACHING TILL IT BEGAN TO LAP THE FEET OF OUR BLACK COMPANIONS
AS HIGH AS WE COULD ON LEDGES AND BLOCKS OF STONE
WHERE WE WILL PLACE THE AMMUNITION LET'S KEEP THAT DRY IF WE CAN IT MAY NOT BE TOUCHED BY THE WATER EVEN IF WE HAVE TO SWIM FOR OUR LIVES THE GUNS WON'T HURT THAT IS IF THEY ARE NOT WASHED AWAY
TO OUR PLACE OF REFUGE AND WHERE A MINUTE BEFORE THERE HAD BEEN A ROCKY SHELF THE PATH ALONG WHICH WE HAD COME
THEN THERE WAS A DEAD PAUSE AS THE THUNDER CRASHED OVERHEAD ONCE MORE AND THEN SEEMED TO BE CONTINUED IN A STRANGE RUSHING SOUND WHICH APPARENTLY PARALYSED THE ATTACKING PARTY WHO HESITATED
CLAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER AND TURNING SHARPLY I SAW THE MEANING OF THE PROLONGATION OF THE THUNDER FOR A GREAT WAVE AT LEAST TEN FEET HIGH RUDDY FOAMING AND FULL OF TOSSING BRANCHES CAME RUSHING DOWN THE GORGE
TO BE SMOOTHED AND FOLDED AND LAID UPON THE JACKET AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I THOROUGHLY REALISED HOW EXCESSIVELY THIN POOR JACK PENNY WAS AND THE REASON WHY
I SAY JOE CARSTAIRS IF I'D KNOWN WE WERE GOING TO BE DROWNED I WOULDN'T HAVE COME ARE YOU SURE IT IS RISING SAID THE DOCTOR BENDING DOWN TO EXAMINE THE LEVEL AN EXAMPLE I FOLLOWED
GET MUCH TOO MUCH WATER MASS JOE HE SAID WHAT UM GOING TO DO I SHOOK MY HEAD SADLY
THEY SHOWED NO FEAR THEY RAISED NO WILD CRY THEY ONLY SEEMED TO BE PREPARING FOR WHAT WAS INEVITABLE
I SAW THE DOCTOR LOOK UP SADLY BUT ONLY TO LOWER HIS HEAD AGAIN
THE OLD STUNNED HELPLESS FEELING BEGAN TO CREEP OVER ME AND I BEGAN TO THINK OF HOME IN A DULL HEAVY MANNER OF THE HAPPY DAYS WHEN I HAD HARDLY A CARE
HE WENT TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF AND DIPPED ONE FOOT IN THE WATER THEN THE OTHER
FOR I KNEW HE FELT THAT IT WAS HOPELESS BUT ALL THE SAME HE GRANTED THAT IT WAS OUR DUTY TO TRY THE DOCTOR NOW BENT DOWN OVER THE WATER AND I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS RISING FASTER THAN EVER
WHEN NO WATER BIG SWIM MANY HAD BEEN THE TIMES WHEN JIMMY AND I HAD DASHED INTO THE RIVER AND SWUM ABOUT BY THE HOUR TOGETHER
FOR HE ROSE FROM WHERE HE HAD BEEN SEATED AND TOOK MY HAND QUITE RIGHT MY LAD HE SAID ONE MUST NEVER SAY DESPAIR THERE'S A LEDGE
IN A NICHE OF THE ROCK WHERE THEIR WEIGHT AND THE SHELTER MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM BEING WASHED AWAY
WITH FRESH ASSAILANTS TAKING THE PLACES OF THOSE WHO FELL THE THUNDER PEALED SO THAT THE REPORTS OF OUR PIECES SEEMED FEEBLE MORE LIKE THE CRACK OF A CART WHIP AND THEIR FLASHES WERE AS SPARKS COMPARED WITH THE BLINDING LIGHTNING
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE WE AWAIT OUR FATE I GLANCED FROM THE BLACKS TO THE DOCTOR TO SEE THAT HE WAS INTENTLY GAZING UP THE GORGE WHERE THE RUSHING WATER CAME SEETHING DOWN
BUT SOMEHOW I DID NOT FEEL AS IF I REPENTED OF COMING SAVE WHEN I THOUGHT THAT MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE TWO SORROWS NOW WHEN SHE CAME
STOPPED SHORT ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY UP THE NARROW SLOPE THAT LED TO OUR LITTLE FORT AND THEN WITH A SHRIEK OF DISMAY TURNED AND BEGAN TO RETREAT I STARED AFTER THEM
AND THEN I JOINED THE DOCTOR IN SEARCHING
CAN WE DO ANYTHING DOCTOR I SAID AT LAST IN A LOW AWE STRICKEN VOICE HE GAZED AT ME TENDERLY AND HELD OUT HIS HAND TO PRESS MINE WHEN I LAID IT IN HIS GRASP
UP ALONG BOY UP ALONG AND HE PATTED THE TOP OF ONE OF THE STONES THAT WE HAD USED FOR A BREASTWORK THE DOG LEAPED UP DIRECTLY PLACING HIMSELF THREE FEET ABOVE THE FLOOD AND STOOD
THERE WAS THE OLD PAIN
ABUTMENT AND REACHING UP AS HIGH AS HE COULD BEGAN TO CLIMB IT DID NOT SEEM TO OCCUR TO HIM AT FIRST THAT IF HE WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE NO ONE ELSE WOULD BE AND HE TRIED TWICE
IT WAS AS IF HE HAD PREPARED HIMSELF FOR THE WORST AND WAS NOW GOING TO MAKE STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO SAVE HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS
SNUFFED AT IT LAPPED A LITTLE AND THREW UP HIS HEAD AGAIN BARKING AND SPLASHING IN IT A LITTLE AS HE RAN IN BREAST HIGH AND CAME BACK AS IF INTIMATING THAT HE WAS
NOT DIE YET WHILE JIMMY NOT GO DIE
DO HE SAID WHY SWIM FOR IT YOU DON'T SUPPOSE I'M GOING TO TRY IN MY CLOTHES MY MIRTH DIED OUT AS SWIFTLY AS IT CAME FOR THE DOCTOR LAID HIS HAND UPON MY ARM
AND THEN RISE UP AND LOOK ROUND AT HIS COMPANIONS SAYING A FEW WORDS IN THEIR TONGUE THE CHILL OF HORROR CAME BACK ONCE MORE
BUT I CAN SEE NONE UNLESS THE WATER SINKS WE ARE LOST JOE MY LAD YOU MUST ACT LIKE A MAN I'LL TRY DOCTOR I SAID IN A CHOKING VOICE AND AS I SPOKE
THAT WHEN THE FINAL STRUGGLE WAS AT HAND WE SHOULD BE SO CLASPED TOGETHER THAT SWIMMING WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AND WE MUST ALL BE DROWNED AND NOW ONCE MORE WITH THE WATER RISING STEADILY
AS IF I COULD NOT BREATHE THE NEXT MINUTE GYP WAS BARKING FURIOUSLY AS HE STOOD UPON HIS HIND LEGS RESTING HIS PAWS UPON HIS MASTER'S SHOULDERS AND JIMMY GAVE A LOUD SHOUT ALL A WATER RUN AWAY
AND THE BLINDING LIGHTNING THE ENEMY HAD BRAVED OUR DEFENCE HAD HAD NO EFFECT UPON THEM SAVE TO MAKE THEM ATTACK MORE FIERCELY AND YET THEY WERE NOW IN FULL RETREAT
AND THE DELUGING RAIN AT DEFIANCE THEY CAME RUSHING ON SHOUTING AND YELLING FURIOUSLY AND WE WERE ABOUT TO DRAW TRIGGER RELUCTANTLY ENOUGH BUT IN SHEER DESPERATION WHEN A VOLLEY OF ARROWS CHECKED THEM FOR A TIME
I TURNED AGHAST TO THE DOCTOR AND THEN MADE AS IF TO RUN EXPECTING THAT THE NEXT MOMENT WE SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY BUT HE CAUGHT ME BY THE ARM WITH A GRIP LIKE IRON STAND STILL HE ROARED
WHO HAD BEEN FIERCE AND ANGRY SNAPPING AND BARKING FURIOUSLY AT THE SAVAGES EACH TIME THEY CHARGED SUDDENLY THREW UP HIS HEAD AND UTTERED A DISMAL HOWL HERE YOU HOLD YOUR NOISE CRIED JACK PENNY
AND WHEN THIS HAD GONE BY THERE WAS
AND CAME TO ME WAGGING HIS TAIL AND UTTERING A SHARP BARK OR TWO
WHERE EVEN A BIRD COULD CLIMB AND IN DESPAIR I TOO BEGAN TO STRIP OFF SOME OF MY CLOTHES ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO SWIM SAID THE DOCTOR GRAVELY I NODDED
THAT OF THE FUTURE IS A HOUSE OF ETERNITY I WISH BEFORE I DIE TO BEQUEATH THEE CERTAIN CHARGES AND DO THOU TAKE HEED OF WHAT I SAY AND INCLINE THY HEART TO MY WORDS
NUR AL DIN KISSED THE SULTAN'S HAND AND WENT HOME HE AND HIS FATHER IN LAW JOYING WITH EXCEEDING JOY AND SAYING
AND I FEAR FOR THEE THE TURNS OF TIME THEN HE LET LOAD THE SADDLE BAGS
HE SAID TO HIM O MY SON HERE AM I LEFT A MAN IN YEARS AND HAVE NO MALE CHILDREN BUT ALLAH HATH BLESSED ME WITH A DAUGHTER
THAT THE WORLD OF THE PRESENT IS BUT A HOUSE OF MORTALITY
AND WASTE NOT THY SUBSTANCE LEST HAPLY THOU COME TO WANT AND MUST FARE A BEGGING FROM THE MEANEST OF MANKIND SAVE THY DIRHAMS AND DEEM THEM THE SOVEREIGNEST SALVE FOR THE WOUNDS OF THE WORLD AND HERE AGAIN
DURING ALL THE TIME OF HIS EARLIEST YOUTH HE HAD NEVER LEFT THE HOUSE TILL ON A CERTAIN DAY HIS FATHER THE WAZIR NUR AL DIN CLAD HIM IN HIS BEST CLOTHES AND MOUNTING HIM ON A SHE MULE OF THE FINEST WENT UP WITH HIM TO THE SULTAN
ON THE SEVENTH DAY AFTER HIS BIRTH MADE ENTERTAINMENTS AND SPREAD BANQUETS
TEACHING HIM READING WRITING AND CYPHERING THEOLOGY AND BELLES LETTRES HIS GRANDFATHER THE OLD WAZIR HAD BEQUEATHED TO HIM THE WHOLE OF HIS PROPERTY WHEN HE WAS BUT FOUR YEARS OF AGE NOW
LEAVING HIM AGAINST HIS WILL NOW TAKE THEE A SHEET OF PAPER AND WRITE UPON IT WHATSO I SAY TO THEE BADR AL DIN TOOK A FAIR LEAF AND SET ABOUT DOING HIS FATHER'S BIDDING AND HE WROTE THEREON
HE MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF THE WAZIR AND THAT SHE BARE HIM A SON AND
THE FORERUNNER OF DEATH BUT PRESENTLY RECOVERING HIMSELF HE SAID O HASAN O MY SON
AS IS THE WONT OF MINISTERS WHILE THE SULTAN WATCHED HIM AND WONDERED AT HIS WIT AND GOOD SENSE JUDGEMENT AND INSIGHT WHEREFOR HE LOVED HIM AND TOOK HIM INTO INTIMACY WHEN THE DIVAN WAS DISMISSED
BUT I SWORE THAT I WOULD MARRY MY DAUGHTER TO NONE SAVE TO THE SON OF MY BROTHER ON THE DAY HER MOTHER GAVE HER BIRTH WHICH WAS NIGH UPON NINETEEN YEARS AGO I HAVE LATELY HEARD THAT MY BROTHER DIED AT BASSORAH WHERE
NOW THE CAUSE OF HIS DEPARTURE WAS THAT ONE NIGHT AS WE WERE SITTING TOGETHER AND TALKING OF WIVES AND CHILDREN TO COME WE HAD WORDS ON THE MATTER
AND SYMMETRY AND PERFECT GRACE EVEN AS THE POET SAID IN THESE VERSES
WHO SALUTED HER AND SHE SAID TO HIM WHENCE COMEST THOU FROM CAIRO HE REPLIED
THOU ART MY NEPHEW THE SON OF MY BROTHER AND BRING THEE TO BE APPOINTED WAZIR IN MY PLACE THAT I MAY KEEP THE HOUSE FOR BY ALLAH O MY SON I AM STRICKEN IN YEARS AND AWEARY WHEN NUR AL DIN HEARD THE WAZIR'S WORDS
SO HE LEANT HIS HEAD AGAINST HIS FATHER'S GRAVE AND SLEEP OVERCAME HIM GLORY TO HIM WHO SLEEPETH NOT HE CEASED NOT SLUMBERING TILL THE MOON ROSE
WHEN FAILS MY WEALTH NO FRIEND WILL DEIGN BEFRIEND
THE DAUGHTER OF THE WAZIR OF BASSORAH THIS BEING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WILL OF ALMIGHTY ALLAH THAT HE MIGHT DEAL THE DECREES OF DESTINY TO HIS CREATURES FURTHERMORE IT WAS AS THE TWO BROTHERS HAD SAID
FOR THEIR TWO WIVES BECAME PREGNANT BY THEM ON THE SAME NIGHT AND BOTH WERE BROUGHT TO BED ON THE SAME DAY
HE NEVER MOUNTED HORSE NOR ATTENDED THE DIVAN
BUT HE HATH BEEN REMOVED TO THE GRACE OF ALLAH AND HE INFORMED HIM OF ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END ADDING I AM RESOLVED NEVER TO RETURN HOME BEFORE I HAVE SEEN ALL THE CITIES AND COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD
IN HIS FACE SKY SHINES THE FULLEST MOON IN HIS CHEEKS ANEMONE GLOWS THE SUN HE SO CONQUERED BEAUTY THAT HE HATH WON ALL CHARMS OF HUMANITY ONE BY ONE THE PROFESSOR BROUGHT HIM UP IN HIS FATHER'S PALACE
AND ANOTHER DAY AGAINST THEE AND ALL WORLDLY GOODS ARE BUT A LOAN TO BE REPAID AND I HAVE HEARD A POET SAY TAKE THOUGHT NOR HAST TO WIN THE THING THOU WILT HAVE RUTH ON MAN
QUOTH THE MINISTER O OUR LORD THE SULTAN I HAD A BROTHER
WAZIR OF EGYPT OF A DAUGHTER NEVER IN CAIRO WAS SEEN A FAIRER AND
NO TYRANT BUT SHALL RUE WORSE TYRANT'S IRE THE THIRD BEHEST IS LEARN TO BE SILENT IN SOCIETY AND LET THINE OWN FAULTS DISTRACT THINE ATTENTION FROM THE FAULTS OF OTHER MEN FOR
A FULL ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIS SIRE FIRST AND LAST THE DATES OF HIS ARRIVAL AT BASSORAH AND OF HIS FOREGATHERING WITH THE WAZIR
ABOUT HIM AS FOR THE MINISTER'S DAUGHTER SHE SITTETH AMONG HER NURSES AND TIREWOMEN
IT WAS DARK NIGHT WHEN HE ALIGHTED AT THE KHAN SO HE SPREAD OUT HIS PRAYER CARPET AND TOOK DOWN THE SADDLE BAGS FROM THE BACK OF HIS MULE AND GAVE HER WITH HER FURNITURE IN CHARGE OF THE DOOR KEEPER THAT HE MIGHT WALK HER ABOUT
HE CALLED TO MIND HIS BROTHER AND HIS HOME AND HIS NATIVE LAND AND WEPT OVER HIS SEPARATION FROM THOSE HE HAD FIRST LOVED THEN
SEE AH SHALL I EVER SIGHT AGAIN OUR FAIR PAST NIGHTS OF YOUR AND SHALL A SINGLE HOUSE BECOME A HOME FOR ME ONCE MORE THEN HE WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND NIGHT CAME UPON HIM
TIS LATE IN THE DAY AND THOU ART CLAD BUT LIGHTLY AND
KEEP THIS PAPER WITH ALL CARE FOR
AND THY LUCK PREVAIL O'ER THE ENVIER'S SPITE AND
HE LODGED HIM IN A PLEASANT PLACE AND ENTREATED HIM HONOURABLY AND MADE MUCH OF HIM
BADR AL DIN COVERED HIS HEAD WITH THE SKIRT OF HIS GARMENT AND WENT FORTH ON FOOT TILL HE STOOD OUTSIDE OF THE CITY WHERE HE HEARD FOLK SAYING THE SULTAN HATH SENT HIS NEW WAZIR TO THE HOUSE OF THE OLD WAZIR NOW NO MORE TO SEAL HIS PROPERTY AND SEIZE HIS SON BADR AL DIN HASAN
AND TAKE HIM BEFORE THE PRESENCE THAT HE MAY PUT HIM TO DEATH AND ALL CRIED ALAS FOR HIS BEAUTY AND HIS LOVELINESS WHEN HE HEARD THIS HE FLED FORTH AT HAZARD KNOWING NOT WHITHER HE WAS GOING AND GAVE NOT OVER HURRYING ONWARDS TILL
TILL AT LAST HE SAID TO ONE OF HIS PAGES BRING HITHER YON DOOR KEEPER THE PAGE WENT AND RETURNED TO THE WAZIR WITH THE PORTER WHO KISSED THE GROUND BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND THE MINISTER ASKED HIM WHO IS THE OWNER OF YONDER MULE
AND MARVELLED AT HIS COMELINESS AND LOVED HIM AS FOR THE CITY FOLK WHEN HE FIRST PASSED BEFORE THEM WITH HIS FATHER THEY MARVELLED AT HIS EXCEEDING BEAUTY
INCREASED HIS STIPEND AND SUPPLIES UNTIL HIS MEANS WERE AMPLE AND HE BECAME THE OWNER OF SHIPS
DESTINY DROVE HIM TO HIS FATHER'S TOMB SO HE ENTERED THE CEMETERY AND THREADING HIS WAY THROUGH THE GRAVES
PERHAPS THERE IS YET TIME SEE IF HE IS STILL IN THE SAME PLACE
BRING HIM HERE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK SIR AND MAY HEAVEN BLESS YOU AS I BLESS YOU AND NOW TIS YOUR TURN SAID THE COADJUTOR TURNING TO THE LAST THAT REMAINED HAVE YOU ANYTHING AS GOOD TO OFFER ME AS THE TWO GENTLEMEN WHO HAVE LEFT US BETTER MY LORD
THAT IS A STRANGE QUESTION SAID ARAMIS HE IS AND HE IS NOT REPLIED ATHOS THAT IS TO SAY HE IS DISMISSED BY ONE HALF OF FRANCE BUT BY INTRIGUES AND PROMISES HE MAKES THE OTHER HALF SUSTAIN HIM
THE CAPTAIN WAS ONLY WAITING FOR HIS PASSENGERS HARDLY HAD THEY PUT FOOT ON DECK ERE HER HEAD WAS TURNED TOWARDS HASTINGS WHERE THEY WERE TO DISEMBARK AT THIS INSTANT THE THREE FRIENDS TURNED IN SPITE OF THEMSELVES A LAST LOOK ON THE ROCK
WHEN ONCE MORE ALONE GONDY SENT TO SUMMON ALL THE CURATES WITH WHOM HE HAD ANY CONNECTION TO HIS HOUSE TWO HOURS LATER
THE ONLY ONE WHICH COULD BE CAUGHT AT BY THE JOKERS ANNE TURNED AROUND AND DIRECTED A GLANCE TOWARD HER FAVORITES WHICH ANNOUNCED THAT SHE DELIVERED UP THE COADJUTOR TO THEIR TENDER MERCIES IMMEDIATELY THE WITS OF THE COURT PLUNGED INTO SATIRE
AND NEVER OF THE HEART YES IT IS ONE OF MILADY'S BASTARDS YOU LAUGH ARAMIS FROM HABIT THAT IS ALL I SWEAR TO YOU I LIKE NO BETTER THAN YOURSELF TO MEET THAT VIPER IN MY PATH AH
ALAS YES MURMURED DE WINTER THEN WAIT SAID ARAMIS AND WITH THE TERRIBLE COOLNESS WHICH ON IMPORTANT OCCASIONS HE SHOWED HE TOOK ONE OF THE MUSKETS FROM TONY
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO PASS BETWEEN THE POINT OF THE JETTY SURMOUNTED BY A BEACON JUST LIGHTED AND A ROCK WHICH JUTTED OUT THEY SAW HIM IN THE DISTANCE CLIMBING THE ROCK IN ORDER TO LOOK DOWN UPON THE BOAT AS IT PASSED
WHO HAS GREAT INFLUENCE UPON THE COMMERCE OF HIS QUARTER WHAT IS HIS NAME
IT IS NOW NOON AT MIDNIGHT I WILL BE AT YOUR HOUSE IF I SHOULD NOT BE IN WAIT FOR ME GOOD AT MIDNIGHT MY LORD AT MIDNIGHT MY DEAR MONSIEUR LOUVIERES
IN A LOW TONE TO ARAMIS THEY HAD REACHED THE LADDER WHICH LED TO THE BOAT DE WINTER MADE THE GROOMS WHO CARRIED THE ARMS AND THE PORTERS WITH THE LUGGAGE DESCEND FIRST AND WAS ABOUT TO FOLLOW THEM AT THIS MOMENT
THE WAR WILL NOT ONLY BE APPROVED OF BUT DIRECTED BY THE CHURCH AS FOR THE REMISSION OF YOUR SINS WE HAVE THE ARCHBISHOP OF PARIS WHO HAS THE VERY GREATEST POWER AT THE COURT OF ROME AND EVEN THE COADJUTOR
UNGRATEFUL COURT FAITHLESS COURT COWARDLY COURT I WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO LAUGH TO MORROW BUT IN ANOTHER MANNER BUT WHILST THEY WERE INDULGING IN EXTRAVAGANT JOY AT THE PALAIS ROYAL TO INCREASE THE HILARITY OF THE QUEEN
YES BUT THE SON HAS DONE US NO HARM GRIMAUD WHO HAD RISEN TO WATCH THE EFFECT OF THE SHOT FELL BACK HOPELESS WRINGING HIS HANDS THE YOUNG MAN BURST INTO A LAUGH
HOLD YOUR TONGUE REPLIED ARAMIS YOU WOULD MAKE ME WEEP IF SUCH A THING WERE POSSIBLE AT THIS MOMENT THEY WERE HAILED BY A VOICE FROM THE SLOOP AND A FEW SECONDS LATER MEN SERVANTS AND BAGGAGE WERE ABOARD
YOU WILL CALL ME THE MOST TIMOROUS OF VISIONARIES BUT
REMAINED CALM AND STERN THE QUEEN AT LAST ASKED HIM IF HE HAD ANYTHING TO ADD TO THE FINE DISCOURSE HE HAD JUST MADE TO HER YES MADAME REPLIED THE COADJUTOR I HAVE TO BEG YOU TO REFLECT TWICE
THE EYES OF THE MENDICANT DASHED WITH CUPIDITY BUT HE QUICKLY SUPPRESSED HIS EMOTION THIS EVENING SIR HE REPLIED
UPON THE MENACING FIGURE WHICH PURSUED THEM AND NOW STOOD OUT WITH A DISTINCTNESS STILL THEN A VOICE REACHED THEM ONCE MORE SENDING THIS THREAT
MONSIEUR DE RETZ WISHED TO BECOME ARCHBISHOP IN HIS UNCLE'S PLACE AND CARDINAL LIKE MAZARIN AND THE POPULAR PARTY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY ACCORD HIM FAVORS SO ENTIRELY ROYAL HE THEREFORE HASTENED TO THE PALACE
COMMINGES WAS NEAR THE QUEEN WHO WAS QUESTIONING HIM UPON THE DETAILS OF HIS EXPEDITION AND EVERY ONE WAS LISTENING TO HIS ACCOUNT WHEN D'ARTAGNAN AND PORTHOS WERE PERCEIVED AT THE DOOR BEHIND THE CARDINAL
FOR IT TO BE WELCOME TO YOU NOW NEVER MIND SAID THE COADJUTOR YOU MUST BE WELL AWARE THAT THIS REQUIRES REFLECTION AND HOW MANY HOURS OF REFLECTION DO YOU ASK TWELVE HOURS SIR IS IT TOO LONG
THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY KIND TO ME AND THEREFORE I IN MY TURN WILL BE SERVICEABLE TO YOU
MY DEAR MONSIEUR LOUVIERES SAID THE COADJUTOR BELIEVE ME I AM TRULY CONCERNED FOR THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO YOU IS THAT TRUE AND DO YOU SPEAK SERIOUSLY ASKED LOUVIERES FROM THE DEPTH OF MY HEART SAID GONDY
ON ARRIVING AT THE RUE DES PROUVAIRES THE CURATE POINTED TOWARD THE SQUARE BEFORE THE CHURCH STOP HE SAID THERE HE IS AT HIS POST GONDY LOOKED AT THE SPOT INDICATED AND PERCEIVED A BEGGAR SEATED IN A CHAIR
GOOD UNEMPLOYED BUT ACTIVE SOULS BRAWLERS CAPABLE OF BRINGING DOWN THE WALLS OF THE PALAIS ROYAL BY CRYING DOWN WITH MAZARIN AS FELL THOSE AT JERICHO I THINK SAID THE BEGGAR I CAN UNDERTAKE THINGS MORE DIFFICULT
WHOSE COURAGE NO MAN WOULD HAVE DARED DISPUTE NEVERTHELESS AT THAT VOICE THAT ACCENT AND THOSE GESTURES THEY FELT A CHILL ACCESS OF TERROR CRAMP THEIR VEINS AS FOR GRIMAUD HIS HAIR STOOD ON END AND DROPS OF SWEAT RAN DOWN HIS BROW
SHOWING HIM THE AIRHOLE OF THE CELLAR SAUSAGES
IT WAS SOON TIME FOR GRIMAUD TO RECALL THE PAST ARRIVING BEFORE THE INN AT WHICH HIS MASTER AND HIMSELF HAD MADE SUCH AN ENORMOUS REPAST
A QUARREL ASKED ATHOS AND SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU BECOME AFRAID OF A QUARREL I AM ALWAYS AFRAID OF A QUARREL WHEN I AM EXPECTED AT ANY PLACE AND WHEN SUCH A QUARREL MIGHT POSSIBLY PREVENT MY REACHING IT
GENTLEMEN SAID THE MAN WHO WAS YOUNG AND PALE BOWING WITH EASE AND COURTESY PARDON MY CURIOSITY BUT I SEE YOU COME FROM PARIS
BUT THE LIGHTNING WILL NOT STRIKE UNTIL THERE IS A HAND TO GUIDE IT MY FRIEND SAID GONDY YOU SEEM TO BE A CLEVER AND A THOUGHTFUL MAN ARE YOU DISPOSED TO TAKE A PART IN A LITTLE CIVIL WAR SHOULD WE HAVE ONE AND PUT AT THE COMMAND OF THE LEADER
AND REPEAT OFTEN AND LOUDLY SO THAT ALL MAY KNOW IT THAT THE MISFORTUNES OF FRANCE ARE CAUSED BY MAZARIN HER LOVER AND HER DESTROYER BEGIN THIS WORK TO DAY THIS INSTANT EVEN AND IN THREE DAYS I SHALL EXPECT THE RESULT
AND LEANING AGAINST ONE OF THE MOLDINGS A LITTLE BASIN WAS NEAR HIM AND HE HELD A HOLY WATER BRUSH IN HIS HAND IS IT BY PERMISSION THAT HE REMAINS THERE ASKED GONDY NO MY LORD THESE PLACES ARE BOUGHT
ALTHOUGH ALMOST ENGAGED TO THE LEADERS OF THE FRONDE HE HAD NOT GONE SO FAR BUT THAT RETREAT WAS POSSIBLE SHOULD THE COURT OFFER HIM THE ADVANTAGES FOR WHICH HE WAS AMBITIOUS AND TO WHICH THE COADJUTORSHIP WAS BUT A STEPPING STONE
NOTHING MY LORD EXCEPT THAT HE IS TORMENTED WITH REMORSE WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF EVERY MONTH HE MAKES ME SAY A MASS FOR THE REPOSE OF THE SOUL OF ONE WHO DIED A VIOLENT DEATH
WHILST THE TWO FRIENDS WERE WITH THE CARDINAL THE QUEEN SENT FOR HIM MAZARIN THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE THE MEANS OF INCREASING THE ZEAL OF HIS TWO DEFENDERS IF HE PROCURED THEM PERSONAL THANKS FROM THE QUEEN
HIM I CAN PLACE AT YOUR DISPOSAL IT IS COUNT DE ROCHEFORT I KNOW HIM ALSO BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE IS NOT IN PARIS MY LORD HE HAS BEEN FOR THREE DAYS AT THE RUE CASSETTE AND WHEREFORE HAS HE NOT
AND AS I AM HIS WIFE'S CONFESSOR IF SHE KNOWS WHERE HE IS I SHALL KNOW IT TOO VERY WELL SIR FIND THIS MAN AND WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND HIM BRING HIM TO ME WE WILL BE WITH YOU AT SIX O'CLOCK MY LORD

YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT THIS MAY LAST A LONG TIME HOWEVER SIR SAID THE STRANGER HE HAS NEITHER FLED NOR IS IN PRISON NO SIR NOT AT THIS MOMENT AT LEAST
IT IS HE EXCLAIMED DE WINTER SEIZING THE ARM OF ATHOS IT IS HE I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED HIM AND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN WHOM DO YOU MEAN ASKED ARAMIS MILADY'S SON REPLIED ATHOS THE MONK EXCLAIMED GRIMAUD
THE FOOL OF THE COURT EXCLAIMED THAT THE QUEEN WAS VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THE SUCCOR OF RELIGION AT SUCH A MOMENT THIS CAUSED A UNIVERSAL BURST OF LAUGHTER
AND YOU SAY THAT HE HAS A GREAT INFLUENCE OVER HIS COMPEERS ARE YOU AWARE MY LORD THAT MENDACITY IS AN ORGANIZED BODY A KIND OF ASSOCIATION OF THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THOSE WHO HAVE EVERYTHING AN ASSOCIATION
FAVORED BY MAGNIFICENT WEATHER
I'FAITH EXCLAIMED GONDY YOU SPEAK WITH A CERTAINTY THAT GIVES ME PLEASURE
AND I WILL BRING YOU THE CITIZENS AND THE PARLIAMENT WITH THESE FOUR ELEMENTS PARIS IS OURS IN A WEEK AND BELIEVE ME MONSIEUR COADJUTOR THE COURT WILL GIVE FROM FEAR WHAT IT WILL NOT GIVE FROM GOOD WILL
WHO POSSESSES SOME PLENARY INDULGENCES WE WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO HIM CONSIDER MAILLARD SAID THE CURATE THAT I HAVE RECOMMENDED YOU TO THIS GENTLEMAN WHO IS A POWERFUL LORD AND THAT I HAVE MADE MYSELF RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU
IN WHICH EVERY ONE TAKES HIS SHARE ONE THAT ELECTS A LEADER YES I HAVE HEARD IT SAID REPLIED THE COADJUTOR WELL THE MAN WHOM I OFFER YOU IS A GENERAL SYNDIC AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF HIM
TO L'EPEE DU GRAND HENRI FOR INSTANCE REFRESH YOURSELVES AND IN TWO HOURS BE UPON THE JETTY OUR BOAT IS WAITING FOR US THERE THE MATTER BEING THUS DECIDED THE TWO FRIENDS FOUND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PACES FURTHER
WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN THE LATTER TO MAKE A SHORT CUT HAD APPEARED ON A SLUICE HE CERTAINLY BODES US NO GOOD SAID ATHOS BUT LET US EMBARK ONCE OUT AT SEA LET HIM COME
SHOULD WE FIND ONE YOUR PERSONAL INFLUENCE AND THE INFLUENCE YOU HAVE ACQUIRED OVER YOUR COMRADES YES SIR PROVIDED THIS WAR WERE APPROVED OF BY THE CHURCH AND WOULD ADVANCE THE END I WISH TO ATTAIN I MEAN THE REMISSION OF MY SINS
AND READY RIGGED AS IF WAITING TO START THAT IS DOUBTLESS OUR BOAT SAID ATHOS YES REPLIED ARAMIS AND THE SLOOP OUT THERE MAKING READY TO SAIL MUST BE THAT WHICH IS TO TAKE US TO OUR DESTINATION
THINK WHAT A SOLEMN ENGAGEMENT YOU ARE MAKING ONE HAS OFFERED A WEALTHY SHOPKEEPER THE OTHER A COUNT YOU ARE GOING THEN TO OFFER A PRINCE ARE YOU I OFFER YOU A BEGGAR MY LORD AH AH SAID GONDY REFLECTING
AH MADAME SAID COMMINGES HASTENING TO D'ARTAGNAN HERE IS ONE WHO CAN TELL YOU BETTER THAN MYSELF FOR HE WAS MY PROTECTOR WITHOUT HIM I SHOULD PROBABLY AT THIS MOMENT BE A DEAD FISH IN THE NETS AT SAINT CLOUD
FOR IT WAS A QUESTION OF NOTHING LESS THAN THROWING ME INTO THE RIVER SPEAK D'ARTAGNAN SPEAK D'ARTAGNAN HAD BEEN A HUNDRED TIMES IN THE SAME ROOM WITH THE QUEEN SINCE HE HAD BECOME LIEUTENANT OF THE MUSKETEERS BUT HER MAJESTY HAD NEVER ONCE SPOKEN TO HIM
DE WINTER TURNED AND FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION OF ARAMIS'S FINGER THE BEACON BATHED WITH LIGHT THE LITTLE STRAIT THROUGH WHICH THEY WERE ABOUT TO PASS AND THE ROCK WHERE THE YOUNG MAN STOOD WITH BARE HEAD AND CROSSED ARMS
THIS SHE SAID IN ANSWER TO A THREAT WHICH HE HAD MADE OFTEN BEFORE AND NOW REPEATED OF GETTING RID ALTOGETHER OF THE HOUSE IN BELGRAVE SQUARE WHENEVER HE MADE THIS THREAT HE DID NOT SCRUPLE TO TELL HER THAT THE HOUSE HAD TO BE KEPT UP SOLELY FOR HER WELFARE
HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT AS YET REALLY THIS TAKES ME QUITE BY SURPRISE I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN ENOUGH THOUGHT TO THE MATTER I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS SAID LORD SILVERBRIDGE
I THINK YOU DO I AM SURE I HOPE YOU DO
WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN UPON HIM AT THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE SHOWED BY A HUNDRED LITTLE SIGNS HIS ANXIETY THAT HIS SON AND HEIR SHOULD ARRANGE HIS AFFAIRS WITH LADY MABEL THESE SIGNS WERE MANIFEST TO MARY
ISABEL WOULD NOT TAKE THE PRIZE WITHOUT THE DUKE'S CONSENT AND MABEL COULD NOT HAVE IT WITHOUT THAT OTHER CONSENT
BUT HE SELECTED TWO FOR HIS PECULIAR NOTICE AND THOSE TWO WERE MISS BONCASSEN AND LADY MABEL WHILE HE WOULD HIMSELF WALK AND TALK AND ARGUE AFTER HIS OWN PECULIAR FASHION WITH THE AMERICAN BEAUTY
BUT NOW SHE PUT IT UP AGAIN FOR A MOMENT SO THAT HE MIGHT FEEL THE PRESSURE OF HER FINGERS
HOW MUCH I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR FRANK AND THEN WHAT A WIFE I SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM I THINK YOU WOULD HE'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER HALF SO GOOD AND HE'LL BE SURE TO GET ONE BEFORE LONG
EXPLAINING TO HER MATTERS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL TILL HE PERSUADED HER TO PROMISE TO READ HIS PAMPHLET UPON DECIMAL COINAGE HE WAS ALWAYS MAKING AWKWARD EFFORTS TO THROW SILVERBRIDGE AND LADY MABEL TOGETHER
I THINK THAT PEOPLE IN POLITICS SHOULD REMAIN AS THEY ARE BORN UNLESS THEY ARE VERY WISE INDEED WHEN MEN COME TO BE STATESMEN AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING OF COURSE THEY CAN CHANGE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS I HOPE THAT IS NOT INTENDED FOR ME LADY MABEL
I WANT TO MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER SAID SILVERBRIDGE ISABEL HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS DOWNRIGHT AND IN SUCH A MATTER HE HAD HARDLY AS YET LEARNED HOW TO EXPRESS HIMSELF WITH THOSE PARAPHRASES IN WHICH THE WORLD DELIGHTS
BUT TREGEAR IF HE GAVE WAY TO SUCH FOLLIES AS THESE WOULD SOON FALL HEADLONG INTO A PIT FROM WHICH THERE WOULD BE NO ESCAPE AND IF HE DID FALL
HAD HE POSSESSED THE POWER OF PUTTING A VETO UPON IT BUT THERE HAD BEEN A TRANSACTION LATELY BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SON WITH REFERENCE TO THE CUTTING OFF A CERTAIN ENTAIL UNDER WHICH MONEY WAS TO BE PAID TO LORD PERCIVAL THIS MONEY HAD NOT YET BEEN FORTHCOMING
AND MIGHT USE IT AGAINST HIM IF SHE PLEASED IN HIS PRESENT FRAME OF MIND HE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO JOKE WITH HER UPON THE SUBJECT ON THAT SECOND SUNDAY THE BONCASSENS WERE TO RETURN TO LONDON ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY
HOW COULD HER VERY LIFE SERVE HER IF THINGS WERE TO GO ON LIKE THAT HOW WAS SHE TO BEAR IT THINKING OF THIS SHE RESOLVED SHE ALMOST RESOLVED THAT SHE WOULD GO BOLDLY TO HER FATHER AND DESIRE THAT SHE MIGHT BE GIVEN UP TO HER LOVER
FRANK TREGEAR HAS TAKEN TO GAMBLING LIKE THE REST OF THEM WHO SAYS SO
DON'T YOU THINK THAT ONE ALWAYS HAS TO BE SORRY FOR THE YOUNG LADIES YOUNG LADIES GENERALLY HAVE A BAD TIME OF IT
THAT IS WHAT A WIFE OUGHT TO FEEL
YET IN THIS FAMILY CONCLAVE SHE TOOK HER LOVER'S PART THAT IS ALL VERY WELL FATHER SHE SAID I TOLD HIM THE SAME THING MYSELF BUT IF HE IS MAN ENOUGH TO BE FIRM I SHALL NOT THROW HIM OVER NOT FOR ALL THE DUKES IN EUROPE
SHE COULD SEE HIM MARRY AND SMILE AND PERHAPS EVEN LIKE HIS WIFE AND WHILE HE WAS DOING SO SHE COULD ALSO MARRY AND RESOLVE THAT THE HUSBAND WHOM SHE TOOK SHOULD BE MADE TO THINK THAT HE HAD A LOVING WIFE BUT WERE FRANK TO DIE
AS SOON AS YOU ARE GONE AS SOON AS WE ARE ALONE TOGETHER I WILL AND THEN I WILL FOLLOW YOU TO LONDON NOW SHALL WE NOT SAY GOOD BYE GOOD BYE MY OWN SHE WHISPERED
NOW TELL THE TRUTH LADY MABEL DOES HE NOT LOOK CONCEITED SOMETIMES HE GENERALLY LOOKS AS IF HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS MORE THAN SOME OTHER PEOPLE DO
PSHA YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN I MIGHT HAVE HAD THE FEELINGS OF A GENTLEMAN AS WELL AS THE BEST MAN THAT EVER WAS BORN I HAVEN'T BUT I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING SO MEAN AS GAMBLING NOW I HAVE GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU WHAT IS IT YOU DO FRIGHTEN ME SO WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE THAT
THAT SHE MUST MARRY HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE AS AN UNMARRIED GIRL SHE WAS A BURDEN DURING THE DINNER SHE WAS VERY GAY TO BE GAY WAS THE HABIT WE MAY ALMOST SAY THE WORK OF HER LIFE IT SO CHANCED THAT SHE SAT BETWEEN SIR TIMOTHY BEESWAX
MISTER BONCASSEN HAD SEEN NOTHING OF IT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE AWARE OF WHAT I HAVE GOT TO SAY I CANNOT QUITE SAY THAT I AM MY LORD BUT WHATEVER IT IS I AM SURE I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT
HER BROTHER THOUGH MORE TRIUMPHANT FOR HOW COULD HE FAIL TO TRIUMPH AFTER SUCH WORDS AS ISABEL HAD SPOKEN TO HIM STILL FELT HIS DIFFICULTIES VERY SERIOUSLY SHE HAD IMBUED HIM WITH A STRONG SENSE OF HER OWN FIRMNESS
WHICH OPPOSITION WOULD MAKE HIS FATHER QUITE UNABLE TO ENTERTAIN HIS GUESTS WHILE IT LASTED BUT AS HE COULD NOT DECLARE HIS WISHES TO HIS FATHER
THEN HE CONSIDERED WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT POSSIBLY MAKE SOME BARGAIN WITH HIS FATHER HOW WOULD IT BE IF HE SHOULD CONSENT TO GO BACK TO THE LIBERAL PARTY ON BEING ALLOWED TO MARRY THE GIRL HE LOVED AS FAR AS HIS POLITICAL FEELINGS WERE CONCERNED
ISABEL NO DOUBT HAD SUGGESTED A DIFFERENT COURSE BUT THAT WHICH ISABEL HAD SUGGESTED WAS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM NOW AT THIS INSTANT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S FORETHOUGHT HE DETERMINED TO TELL HIS STORY TO ISABEL'S FATHER
I SHALL NOT STAY HERE TO BE POINTED AT I WILL GO BACK HOME IF HE FOLLOWS ME THEN I SHALL CHOOSE TO FORGET ALL ABOUT HIS RANK IF HE LOVES ME WELL ENOUGH TO SHOW THAT HE IS IN EARNEST I SHALL NOT DISAPPOINT HIM FOR THE SAKE OF PLEASING HIS FATHER
AND GRADUALLY THEY BECAME MANIFEST TO ISABEL BONCASSEN THE HOST HIMSELF AS HOST WAS COURTEOUS TO ALL HIS GUESTS THEY HAD BEEN OF HIS OWN SELECTION
I HOPE YOU DON'T OBJECT TO ME PERSONALLY MY DEAR YOUNG LORD YOUR FATHER HAS GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO BE CIVIL TO ME AM I TO RETURN HIS COURTESY BY BRINGING A GREAT TROUBLE UPON HIM HE SEEMS TO BE VERY FOND OF MISS BONCASSEN
AFTER THE DINNER SHE WENT HOME ALONE THERE WERE OTHER FESTIVITIES TO BE ATTENDED HAD SHE PLEASED TO ATTEND THEM
I HAVE NO IDEA OF GOING ON SUCH A JOURNEY EXCEPT ON TERMS OF EQUALITY JUST STEP AND STEP ALIKE THEN SHE TOOK HOLD OF HIS ARM AND PUT OUT ONE FOOT ARE YOU READY I AM VERY WILLING
WHAT DID YOU DO I SPARED HIM
EXCEPT THAT IT IS EVIDENT TO YOU AS IT IS TO ME THAT SHE COULD NOT WITH PROPRIETY SAY ANYTHING ELSE I THINK SHE WOULD WOULD LIKE IT YOU KNOW SHE WOULD LIKE TO BE YOUR WIFE
AS ANY OTHER LOVER MIGHT TELL IT TO ANY OTHER FATHER I AM VERY GLAD TO FIND OURSELVES ALONE MISTER BONCASSEN HE SAID MISTER BONCASSEN BOWED AND SHOWED HIMSELF PREPARED TO LISTEN THOUGH SO MANY AT MATCHING HAD SEEN THE WHOLE PLAY
AS THEY WALKED TOGETHER FROM THE BEARGARDEN HAD ALREADY BEEN THROWN TO THE WINDS HE DID NOT LIKE TO ASK WHY THE THING WAS NOT SETTLED YOUNG MEN HE THOUGHT WERE SOMETIMES SHY AND YOUNG LADIES NOT ALWAYS READY TO GIVE IMMEDIATE ENCOURAGEMENT
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MISTER TIFTO MAJOR TIFTO OR MAJOR TIFTO WHAT DOES IT SIGNIFY NO OF COURSE WE INFERIOR PEOPLE MAY LOSE OUR MONEY JUST AS WE PLEASE BUT A MAN WHO CAN LOOK AS CLEVER AS MISTER TREGEAR OUGHT TO WIN ALWAYS
HE ASKED ME WHETHER I LIKED HIM WELL ENOUGH
AND KNEW WELL HOW THE MATTER WAS KNEW THAT THEY WERE RIVALS AND KNEW EACH THE GROUND ON WHICH SHE HERSELF AND ON WHICH THE OTHER STOOD BUT NEITHER WAS SATISFIED WITH HER ADVANTAGE OR NEARLY SATISFIED
IF HE WAS IN EARNEST HE WILL COME AGAIN HE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST THEN HE WILL COME AGAIN I DON'T THINK HE WILL SAID LADY MABEL I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS TOO OLD FOR HIM AND I TRIED TO LAUGH HIM OUT OF IT
HE WAS SURE OF THAT KING COPHETUA PROBABLY HAD NOT A FATHER AND THE BEGGAR PROBABLY WAS NOT HIGH MINDED BUT THE DISCREPANCY IN THAT CASE WAS MUCH GREATER HE INTENDED TO PERSEVERE
AND EXPLAINING HOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHILE HE WAS A MEMBER OF ONE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT HIS SON SHOULD BE SITTING AS A MEMBER OF ANOTHER HOW IT WAS THAT A NOBLEMAN COULD BE A COMMONER AND HOW A PEER OF ONE PART OF THE EMPIRE
WELL YES IF IT WERE ALL SERENE I THINK SHE WOULD CONSENT I DARE SAY SHE WOULD CONSENT IF IT WERE ALL SERENE WHY SHOULD SHE NOT DO NOT TRY HER TOO HARD LORD SILVERBRIDGE YOU SAY YOU LOVE HER
LADY MABEL'S PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE WAS AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD DO IT IF HE AND HIS FATHER WERE ALONE TOGETHER OR COMPARATIVELY ALONE HE MUST BE PREPARED FOR AN OPPOSITION AT ANY RATE OF SOME DAYS
WOULD IT BE NO DISGRACE THAT SHE SHOULD BE KNOWN HERE IN ENGLAND TO BE YOUR WIFE AND THAT NONE OF THOSE OF YOUR RANK OF WHAT WOULD THEN BE HER OWN RANK SHOULD WELCOME HER INTO HER NEW WORLD THAT WOULD BE OUT OF THE QUESTION
WHO IN THESE DAYS WAS A VERY GREAT MAN INDEED AND THAT VERY DOLLY LONGSTAFF WHOM SILVERBRIDGE IN HIS IRONY HAD PROPOSED TO HER AS A FITTING SUITOR FOR HER HAND ISN'T LORD SILVERBRIDGE A COUSIN OF YOURS ASKED SIR TIMOTHY A VERY DISTANT ONE HE HAS COME OVER TO US YOU KNOW IT IS SUCH A TRIUMPH
HE SAYS THAT ALMOST ALWAYS WHEN HE COMES BACK FROM THE RACES AND VERY OFTEN WHEN HE COMES BACK FROM THE CLUB PERCIVAL HAS LOST EVER SO MUCH I DON'T THINK MY LORD WILL HAMPER HIMSELF FOR YOUR BROTHER
OUT OF SHEER DOWNRIGHT CHRISTIAN CHARITY I SAID TO MYSELF LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOURS DON'T BE SELFISH DO UNTO HIM AS YOU WOULD HE SHOULD DO UNTO YOU THAT IS THINK OF HIS WELFARE THOUGH I HAD HIM IN MY NET I LET HIM GO
I WAS SO SORRY TO HEAR IT THIS HOWEVER AS THE READER KNOWS WAS A FIB SORRY SAID SIR TIMOTHY SURELY LORD GREX'S DAUGHTER MUST BE A CONSERVATIVE OH YES I AM A CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE I WAS BORN ONE
DUKES AND DUCHESSES WERE NOTHING TO HER IF THEY COULDN'T BE HAPPY IN ENGLAND THEN LET THEM COME AND LIVE IN NEW YORK SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT ANYBODY COULD BE TOO GOOD FOR HER DAUGHTER WAS THERE NOT AN IDEA THAT MISTER BONCASSEN WOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT
AND WAS NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS GOOD AS THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND LORD SILVERBRIDGE WHEN HE LEFT MISTER BONCASSEN WANDERED ABOUT THE PARK BY HIMSELF KING COPHETUA MARRIED THE BEGGAR'S DAUGHTER
I HOPE HE HASN'T I KNOW I HAVE I WISH SOMEONE WOULD STICK UP FOR ME AND SAY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT IS NOT MISTER TREGEAR'S WAY OF LIVING I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT LORD SILVERBRIDGE OR PERCIVAL SHOULD LOSE MONEY OR ME OR YOU IF YOU LIKE TO SAY SO OR TIFTO
BUT TO YOUR OWN FATHER YOU HAVE NOT VENTURED TO SPEAK THEN HE TOLD HIS STORY AS BEST HE KNEW HOW IT WAS NOT THAT HE FEARED HIS FATHER BUT THAT HE FELT THAT THE PRESENT MOMENT WAS NOT FIT
WELL THEN HIS SERENE HIGHNESS THE HEIR OF THE DUKE OF OMNIUM HAS DONE ME THE INEXPRESSIBLE HONOUR OF ASKING ME TO MARRY HIM NO YOU MAY WELL SAY NO AND TO TELL THE TRUTH EXACTLY HE DIDN'T
TO THIS NEITHER MISTER NOR MISSUS BONCASSEN WAS ABLE TO MAKE ANY EFFICIENT ANSWER MISSUS BONCASSEN DEAR GOOD WOMAN COULD SEE NO REASON WHY TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LOVED EACH OTHER SHOULD NOT BE MARRIED AT ONCE
AND MAY YET HAVE TO SAY AT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE CANNOT ACCEPT IT WITHOUT DISGRACE YOU WOULD NOT PUT ONE THAT YOU LOVE INTO SUCH A POSITION AS FOR DISGRACE THAT IS NONSENSE I BEG YOUR PARDON MISTER BONCASSEN
WHAT MORE DO I WANT TO KNOW IF SHE WERE ONCE MY WIFE HE WOULD NOT REJECT HER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS HE IS IN TRUTH THE KINDEST AND MOST AFFECTIONATE AND THEREFORE YOU WOULD TRY HIM AFTER THIS FASHION
SHALL I GO TO HEAVEN FOR DOING THAT I DON'T KNOW SAID MISS CASSEWARY WHO WAS SO MUCH PERTURBED BY THE NEWS SHE HAD HEARD AS TO BE UNABLE TO COME TO ANY OPINION ON THE POINT JUST RAISED OR MAYN'T I RATHER GO TO THE OTHER PLACE
WILL HE CONTINUE TO BE FOND OF HER WHEN HE HAS HEARD THIS WHAT DOES ISABEL SAY SHE SAYS THE SAME AS YOU OF COURSE WHY OF COURSE
DURING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO THE SHOOTING WENT ON WITHOUT MUCH INTERRUPTION FROM LOVE MAKING THE LOVE MAKING WAS NOT PROSPEROUS ALL ROUND POOR LADY MARY HAD NOTHING TO COMFORT HER
HE DOES NOT LIKE BEING LAUGHED AT HE HAS BEEN SAVED AND HE WILL KNOW IT BUT IF HE SHOULD COME AGAIN I SHALL NOT SPARE HIM AGAIN NO NOT TWICE
IF YOUR OWN FATHER REFUSED TO WELCOME HER WOULD NOT OTHERS FOLLOW SUIT YOU DON'T KNOW MY FATHER YOU SEEM TO KNOW HIM WELL ENOUGH TO FEAR THAT HE WOULD OBJECT YES THAT IS TRUE
THIS IS WHERE THE OLD PALLISERS USED TO BE BURIED HE SAID OH INDEED AND MARRIED I SUPPOSE I DARE SAY THEY HAD A PRIEST OF THEIR OWN NO DOUBT WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN CONVENIENT
BUT WHEN HE SAW THEM TOGETHER HE CONCLUDED THAT MATTERS WERE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT WAS HOWEVER AN OPINION WHICH HE HAD ALL TO HIMSELF DURING THE THREE OR FOUR DAYS WHICH FOLLOWED THE SCENE IN THE BILLIARD ROOM
HE WISHES YOU TO MARRY THAT LADY MABEL GREX SHE SAID HE NODDED HIS HEAD
IN JUNE LAST SHE HAD SEEN HIM BY CHANCE FOR A FEW MINUTES IN LADY MABEL'S DRAWING ROOM SINCE THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD FROM HIM OR OF HIM THAT WAS NOW MORE THAN FIVE MONTHS SINCE HOW COULD HER LOVE SERVE HER
TRUSTING MUCH TO A BELIEF THAT WHEN ONCE HE WAS MARRIED HIS FATHER WOULD COME ROUND HIS FATHER ALWAYS DID COME ROUND BUT THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE IMPOSSIBLE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD ASK HIS FATHER'S CONSENT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
HAD DRIVEN OUT OF FREDERICKSBURG THE CONFEDERATE DIVISION OF EARLY BUT WHEN HOOKER FOUND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF LEE HE HESITATED FALTERED INSTEAD OF PUSHING ON AND ALLOWED THE CONSUMMATE GENERAL TO WHOM HE WAS OPPOSED TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE
HE TOOK NOTHING WITH HIM EXCEPT AMMUNITION AND HIS ARMY WAS IN THE LIGHTEST MARCHING ORDER THIS ENABLED HIM TO MOVE WITH GREAT RAPIDITY BUT DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS WAGON TRAINS AND OF ALL MUNITIONS OF WAR EXCEPT CARTRIDGES
LEE WENT SO FAR AS TO DENY THE RIGHT OF SECESSION WHILE JACKSON INSISTED THAT THE SOUTH OUGHT TO TRY TO GET ITS RIGHTS INSIDE THE UNION AND NOT OUTSIDE BUT WHEN VIRGINIA JOINED THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY AND THE WAR HAD ACTUALLY BEGUN
AGAIN THEY CHARGED AND AGAIN WERE DRIVEN BACK AND WHEN THE BATTLE ONCE MORE BEGAN THE UNION REINFORCEMENTS HAD ARRIVED IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT JACKSON HIMSELF WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED HE HAD BEEN LEADING AND URGING ON THE ADVANCE OF HIS MEN
AND MOREOVER IT DELAYED PEMBERTON WHEN DELAY WAS OF VALUE TO GRANT IN FINISHING JOHNSTON AFTER THIS USELESS TURN TO THE SOUTHWARD PEMBERTON RESUMED HIS MARCH TO THE EAST AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE BEGINNING IN ACCORDANCE WITH JOHNSTON'S ORDERS
TO RETURN TO GRAND GULF AND THENCE COOPERATE WITH BANKS AGAINST PORT HUDSON GRANT REPLIED THAT THE ORDER CAME TOO LATE THE BEARER OF THE DESPATCH INSISTED THAT I OUGHT TO OBEY THE ORDER AND WAS GIVING ARGUMENTS TO SUPPORT THE POSITION
TO DO THIS HOWEVER IT FIRST WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO WITHDRAW THE ARMY FROM THE POSITIONS IT THEN HELD NOT FAR ABOVE VICKSBURG ON THE WESTERN BANK OF THE RIVER BUT SUCH A MOVEMENT AT THAT TIME WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY THE COUNTRY
WHAT FLAG IS THIS YOU CARRY ALONG THE SEA AND SHORE THE SAME OUR GRANDSIRES LIFTED UP THE SAME OUR FATHERS BORE IN MANY A BATTLE'S TEMPEST IT SHED THE CRIMSON RAIN
HIS LINES WERE SOON MADE SO STRONG THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE DEFENDERS OF VICKSBURG TO BREAK THROUGH THEM AND ALTHOUGH JOHNSTON HAD GATHERED TROOPS AGAIN TO THE EASTWARD AN ASSAULT FROM THAT QUARTER ON THE NATIONAL ARMY NOW SO LARGELY REINFORCED
BUT GRANT WAS NOW MORE THAN READY HE DID NOT WAIT THE COMING OF PEMBERTON LEAVING JACKSON AS SOON AS HE HEARD OF THE ENEMY'S ADVANCE FROM VICKSBURG HE MARCHED RAPIDLY WESTWARD AND STRUCK PEMBERTON AT CHAMPION HILLS
BROUGHT THE WAR TO A CLOSE HAVE LEFT US MORE THAN A REUNITED REALM NORTH AND SOUTH ALL AMERICANS NOW HAVE A COMMON FUND OF GLORIOUS MEMORIES WE ARE THE RICHER FOR EACH GRIM CAMPAIGN FOR EACH HARD FOUGHT BATTLE
FAR FROM THE REACH OF TELEGRAPHS OR MAIL AS SOON AS THE NATIONAL TROOPS REACHED VICKSBURG AN ASSAULT WAS ATTEMPTED BUT THE PLACE WAS TOO STRONG AND THE ATTACK WAS REPULSED WITH HEAVY LOSS GRANT THEN SETTLED DOWN TO A SIEGE
EVERYTHING HOWEVER IN THIS CAMPAIGN DEPENDED ON QUICKNESS AND GRANT'S DECISION AS WELL AS ALL HIS MOVEMENTS MARKED THE GENIUS OF THE GREAT SOLDIER WHICH CONSISTS VERY LARGELY IN KNOWING JUST WHEN TO ABANDON THE ACCEPTED MILITARY AXIOMS
SHIELDED BY THE FOREST JACKSON MARCHED HIS GRAY COLUMNS RAPIDLY TO THE LEFT ALONG THE NARROW COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL HE WAS SQUARE ON THE FLANK OF THE UNION RIGHT WING WHICH WAS HELD BY THE ELEVENTH CORPS UNDER HOWARD
THERE WAS A SHARP FIGHT BUT GRANT EASILY DEFEATED THE ENEMY AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE TOWN THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT POINT FOR JACKSON WAS THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI AND WAS A BASE OF MILITARY SUPPLIES
IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE REINFORCEMENTS WHICH HE EXPECTED FROM GENERAL BANKS AT PORT HUDSON HE THEREFORE GAVE UP THE IDEA OF MAKING GRAND GULF A BASE AND SHERMAN HAVING NOW JOINED HIM WITH HIS CORPS GRANT STRUCK AT ONCE INTO THE INTERIOR
AND THE CHARGE WAS REPULSED AT ONCE BUT A FEW PRICELESS MOMENTS HAD BEEN SAVED AND PLEASANTON HAD BEEN GIVEN TIME TO POST TWENTY TWO GUNS LOADED WITH DOUBLE CANISTER WHERE THEY WOULD BEAR UPON THE ENEMY
THENCE HE MARCHED TO GRAND GULF ON THE MISSISSIPPI WHICH HE TOOK AND WHICH HE HAD PLANNED TO MAKE A BASE OF SUPPLY WHEN HE REACHED GRAND GULF HOWEVER HE FOUND THAT HE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO WAIT A MONTH
YET IN THE TIMES THAT TRIED MEN'S SOULS HE PROVED NOT ONLY A COMMANDER OF GENIUS BUT A FIGHTER OF IRON WILL AND TEMPER WHO JOYED IN THE BATTLE AND ALWAYS SHOWED AT HIS BEST WHEN THE DANGER WAS GREATEST
WAS PRACTICALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION TIGHTER AND TIGHTER GRANT DREW HIS LINES ABOUT THE CITY WHERE EVERY DAY THE SUFFERING BECAME MORE INTENSE IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GIVE THE DETAILS OF THE SIEGE ON JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
SO AS TO CRUSH LEE BY AN ASSAULT ON HIS FLANK ALL WENT WELL AT THE BEGINNING AND ON THE FIRST OF MAY HOOKER FOUND HIMSELF AT CHANCELLORSVILLE FACE TO FACE WITH THE BULK OF LEE'S FORCES AND SEDGWICK CROSSING THE RIVER AND CHARGING WITH THE UTMOST DETERMINATION
THAT THE UNION SHOULD BE PRESERVED AND SLAVERY ABOLISHED THAT ONE FLAG SHOULD FLY FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE RIO GRANDE THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE FREE IN FACT AS WELL AS IN NAME AND THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD STAND AS ONE NATION
AND THE ONLY POINT AT WHICH THEY COULD CROSS THE RIVER AND KEEP UP COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR ARMIES AND TERRITORY IN THE SOUTHWEST IT WAS THE FIRST HIGH GROUND BELOW MEMPHIS WAS VERY STRONGLY FORTIFIED AND WAS HELD BY A LARGE ARMY UNDER GENERAL PEMBERTON
BY A SYSTEM OF GRADUAL APPROACHES A STRONG BASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AT MEMPHIS AND THEN THE ARMY AND THE FLEET MOVED GRADUALLY FORWARD BUILDING STOREHOUSES AND TAKING STRONG POSITIONS AS THEY WENT
IT WAS QUITE IN KEEPING WITH HIS CHARACTER THAT THIS GENTLE HIGH MINDED AND RELIGIOUS MAN SHOULD EARLY IN THE CONTEST HAVE PROPOSED TO HOIST THE BLACK FLAG NEITHER TAKE NOR GIVE QUARTER AND MAKE THE WAR ONE OF EXTERMINATION
LIKE A SERVANT OF THE LORD WITH HIS BIBLE AND HIS SWORD OUR GENERAL RODE ALONG US TO FORM US FOR THE FIGHT MACAULAY
LEE CONSENTED AND JACKSON AT ONCE MADE OFF THE COUNTRY WAS THICKLY COVERED WITH A FOREST OF RATHER SMALL GROWTH FOR IT WAS A WILD REGION IN WHICH THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF GAME
THE GREAT MISSISSIPPI STRONGHOLD FELL BEFORE HIM EFFORTS WERE MADE THROUGH THE WINTER TO REACH VICKSBURG FROM THE NORTH BY CUTTING CANALS AND BY ATTEMPTS TO GET IN THROUGH THE BAYOUS AND TRIBUTARY STREAMS OF THE GREAT RIVER
AND ACTUALLY LET HIS WHOLE CORPS BE SURPRISED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT YET ALL THE WHILE THE BATTLE WAS GOING ON ELSEWHERE AND BERDAN'S SHARPSHOOTERS HAD SURROUNDED AND CAPTURED A GEORGIA REGIMENT
HE CONSULTED WITH JACKSON AND JACKSON BEGGED TO BE ALLOWED TO MAKE ONE OF HIS FAVORITE FLANK ATTACKS UPON THE UNION ARMY ATTACKS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED ONLY BY A SKILLED AND RESOLUTE GENERAL AND BY TROOPS EQUALLY ABLE TO MARCH AND TO FIGHT
AS DARKNESS DREW NEAR HE WAS IN THE FRONT WHERE FRIEND AND FOE WERE MINGLED IN ALMOST INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION HE AND HIS STAFF WERE FIRED AT AT CLOSE RANGE BY THE UNION TROOPS AND AS THEY TURNED WERE FIRED AT AGAIN
VICKSBURG SURRENDERED THE MISSISSIPPI WAS IN CONTROL OF THE NATIONAL FORCES FROM ITS SOURCE TO ITS MOUTH AND THE CONFEDERACY WAS RENT IN TWAIN
FROM THAT TIME UNTIL HIS DEATH LESS THAN TWO YEARS AFTERWARD HIS CAREER WAS ONE OF BRILLIANT AND ALMOST UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESS WHETHER SERVING WITH AN INDEPENDENT COMMAND IN THE VALLEY
AND DETERMINED TO CROSS THE RIVER FROM THE WESTERN TO THE EASTERN BANK BELOW VICKSBURG TO THE SOUTH WITH THE AID OF THE FLEET WHICH RAN THE BATTERIES SUCCESSFULLY HE MOVED HIS ARMY DOWN THE WEST BANK UNTIL HE REACHED A POINT BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF ATTACK
IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE HOOKER HAD COMMAND OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC LIKE MC CLELLAN HE WAS ABLE TO PERFECT THE DISCIPLINE OF HIS FORCES AND TO ORGANIZE THEM AND AS A DIVISION COMMANDER HE WAS BETTER THAN MC CLELLAN
NO SUCH POLICY WAS PRACTICAL IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND IN THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC BUT IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED QUITE NATURAL AND PROPER TO JACKSON'S ANCESTORS THE GRIM SCOTCH IRISH WHO DEFENDED LONDONDERRY AGAINST THE FORCES OF THE STUART KING
GRANT THEN CROSSED THE BIG BLACK AND THE NEXT DAY WAS BEFORE VICKSBURG WITH HIS ENEMY INSIDE THE WORKS WHEN GRANT CROSSED THE MISSISSIPPI AT BRUINSBURG AND STRUCK INTO THE INTERIOR HE OF COURSE PASSED OUT OF COMMUNICATION WITH WASHINGTON
THE UNION ARMY LAY OPPOSITE FREDERICKSBURG LOOKING AT THE FORTIFIED HEIGHTS WHERE THEY HAD RECEIVED SO BLOODY A REPULSE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WINTER
THE MEN WERE NOT EVEN IN LINE MANY OF THEM HAD STACKED THEIR MUSKETS AND WERE LOUNGING ABOUT SOME PLAYING CARDS OTHERS COOKING SUPPER INTERMINGLED WITH THE PACK MULES AND BEEF CATTLE
WITH A VAST RIVER AND THE STRONGHOLD OF VICKSBURG BETWEEN ME AND MY BASE OF SUPPLIES BUT I WAS ON DRY GROUND ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE RIVER WITH THE ENEMY
BECAUSE OF THE INFINITE WOE AND SUFFERING AND BECAUSE OF THE SPLENDID ULTIMATE TRIUMPH WE HOLD THAT IT WAS VITAL TO THE WELFARE NOT ONLY OF OUR PEOPLE ON THIS CONTINENT BUT OF THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
THE COMPLETE POSSESSION OF THE MISSISSIPPI WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE CONTROL OF THAT GREAT RIVER WOULD CUT THE CONFEDERACY IN TWO AND DO MORE PROBABLY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
OR TO THEIR FOREFATHERS THE COVENANTERS OF SCOTLAND
WAS TO FIGHT AND DEFEAT A SUPERIOR ENEMY SEPARATELY AND IN DETAIL HE LOST NO TIME IN PUTTING HIS PLAN INTO ACTION AND PRESSING FORWARD QUICKLY MET A DETACHMENT OF THE ENEMY AT PORT GIBSON AND DEFEATED THEM
KEENAN'S REGIMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY BUT FOUR HUNDRED SABERS STRONG WAS ACCORDINGLY SENT FULL AGAINST THE FRONT OF THE TEN THOUSAND VICTORIOUS CONFEDERATES KEENAN HIMSELF FELL PIERCED BY BAYONETS
PRESSING FORWARD GRANT MET THE ENEMY NUMBERING BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT THOUSAND AT RAYMOND AND READILY DEFEATED THEM HE THEN MARCHED ON TOWARD JACKSON FIGHTING ANOTHER ACTION AT CLINTON
IN DASH AND LIGHT HEARTED DARING CUSTER AND KEARNEY STOOD AS CONSPICUOUS AS STUART AND MORGAN AND ON THE OTHER HAND NO NORTHERN GENERAL APPROACHED THE ROUNDHEAD TYPE THE TYPE OF THE STERN RELIGIOUS WARRIORS WHO FOUGHT UNDER CROMWELL
HAD NOTICED A MODEST CATCH LET INTO THE WOODWORK
AND IT FELL LIKE LUCIFER SON OF THE MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SAME BUNKER SO THE ARMY PLAYED THREE MORE AND SWEATING PROFUSELY GOT OUT
THAT SHE HUMBLY HOPED THAT SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED SHE GOT UP MUST BE GOING SHE SAID
CERTAINLY CAME FROM THE CHEMIST'S AND WAS NO DOUBT CONNECTED WITH TOO MANY PLUMS
AND ME ON THE OTHER PULLING A LONG FACE OVER MY DIARIES AND NEITHER OF US WITH A ROMAN ROAD OR A DIARY TO OUR NAMES LET'S HAVE AN END TO SUCH UNSOCIABLE ARRANGEMENTS OLD FRIEND
ITS MATCH IN THE AFTERNOON WITH JUST THE LAST HOLE TO PLAY WAS ALL SQUARE SO CAPTAIN PUFFIN HAVING THE HONOUR HIT A LOW NERVOUS DRIVE THAT TAPPED LOUDLY AT THE TIMBERED WALL OF THE BUNKER
THIS ONE HAD BEEN A SHADE MORE ACUTE THAN MOST AND THE DROP INTO AMITY AGAIN WAS A SHADE MORE PRECIPITOUS MAJOR FLINT IN HIS EAGERNESS HAD PUT MOST OF HIS MOUSTACHE INTO THE LIFE GIVING TUMBLER AND DRIED IT ON HIS HANDKERCHIEF
WHEREAS CAPTAIN PUFFIN HAD NOT SHE TOOK HER POPPY BORDERED SKIRT OVER HER ARM AND SMILED HER THANKFUL WAY TO BED SHE COULD ALLOW HERSELF TO WONDER WITH A LITTLE MORE DEFINITENESS NOW THAT THE MAJOR'S LIGHTS WERE OUT AND HE WAS ABED
MISS MAPP HAD PUT THE TWO SPECIMENS OF WHICH SHE HAD SO PROVIDENTIALLY BECOME POSSESSED IN HER LAP AND THEY LOOKED VERY PRETTY AGAINST THE NAVY BLUE OF HER SKIRT
AND BY FOUR O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON THERE WERE ENOUGH POPPIES CUT OUT TO FURNISH WHEN IN SEED A WHOLE STREET OF OPIUM DENS THE DRESS SELECTED FOR DECORATION WAS APART FROM A FEW MILDEW SPOTS
THERE HAD SURELY BEEN DREADFUL EXPOSURES OF PRUDENT HOUSEKEEPERS IN THE PAPERS WHICH WERE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE READING
HELP YOURSELF MAJOR HE SAID WELL THANK YE I DON'T MIND IF I DO HE SAID REVERSING THE FLASK OVER THE TUMBLER THERE'S A GOOD TRAMP IN FRONT OF US NOW THAT THE LAST TRAM HAS GONE TRAM AND TRAMP UPON MY WORD I'VE HALF A MIND TO TELEPHONE FOR A TAXI
THE ICE WAS NOT BROKEN BUT IT WAS CRACKING IN ALL DIRECTIONS UNDER THIS UNEXAMPLED THAW THE TWO HAD CLEARLY INDICATED A MUTUAL SUSPICION OF EACH OTHER'S INDUSTRIOUS HABITS AFTER DINNER
WILL DO THE SAME WITH THE WAISTBAND WHILE I PUT A BORDER OF THEM ROUND THE SKIRT AND MY DEAR OLD DRESS WILL LOOK QUITE NEW AND LOVELY I SHALL BE AT HOME TO NOBODY WITHERS THIS AFTERNOON EVEN IF THE PRINCE OF WALES CAME AND SAT ON MY DOORSTEP AGAIN
AT HIS THIRD ATTEMPT NOTHING HAPPENED AT THE FOURTH THE BALL FLEW AGAINST THE BOARDS REBOUNDED BRISKLY AGAIN INTO THE BUNKER TRICKLED DOWN THE STEEP SANDY SLOPE AND HIT THE MAJOR'S BOOT
AND THAT SHE STILL POPPED AS MUCH AS EVER
THERE'S MY FRIEND THE MAJOR IN HIS STUDY OPPOSITE WITH ALL HIS DIARIES ROUND HIM MAKING A NOTE HERE AND COPYING AN EXTRACT THERE AND CONFERRING WITH THE VICEROY ONE DAY AND REPRIMANDING THE MAHARAJAH
AND IF IT COMES TO THAT REJOINED THE MAJOR I'M SURE I'VE OFTEN DOZED OFF WHEN I'M IN BED AND WOKEN AGAIN AND PULLED UP MY BLIND AND WHAT NOT AND THERE'S YOUR LIGHT STILL BURNING POWERFUL LONG ROADS THOSE OLD ROMANS MUST HAVE MADE CAPTAIN
IF THAT'S NOT THE BEST JOKE I'VE HEARD FOR MANY A LONG DAY HE SAID THERE I'VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE OPPOSITE YOU THESE LAST TWO YEARS SEEING YOUR LIGHT BURNING LATE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AND THINKING TO MYSELF THERE'S MY FRIEND PUFFIN STILL AT IT
WHICH WAS DECORATED WITH LITTLE BUNCHES OF PINK ROSES PEEPING THROUGH TRELLIS THIS WAS IN THE NATURE OF A BONUS SHE HAD NOT UP TILL THEN CONNECTED THE CHINTZ CURTAINS WITH THE LITTLE THINGS THAT HAD FLUTTERED DOWN UPON HER AND WERE NOW SAFE IN HER GLOVE
AND ALL THE TIME YOU'VE BEEN SITTING SNOOZING AND BOOZING IN YOUR CHAIR WITH YOUR GLASS HANDY TO WASH THE DUST DOWN PUFFIN ADDED HIS FALSETTO CACKLE TO THIS MERRIMENT
PRECISELY THEN AND AT NO OTHER TIME MISS MAPP LOOKED UP AND ONE SETTLED ON HER FACE THE OTHER FELL INTO HER BASKET HER TRAINED FACULTIES WERE ALL ON THE ALERT AND SHE THRUST THEM BOTH INSIDE HER GLOVE FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION
YOU SHALL SEE FOR YOURSELF AND THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT THE CUPBOARD WAS FULL OF CHINTZ CURTAINS AND LITTLE BUNCHES OF PINK ROSES NEATLY CUT OUT OF THEM AND A PAIR OF NAIL SCISSORS
PUFFIN NATURALLY SAW IT IN ANOTHER LIGHT HE HAD PAID FOR THE WHISKY WHICH MAJOR FLINK HAD DRUNK OR OWED FOR IT IN HIS WINE MERCHANT'S BILL THAT WAS MONEY JUST AS MUCH AS A FLORIN PUSHED ACROSS THE COUNTER
IF THE COAL STRIKE TOOK PLACE THERE WOULD BE SOME DIFFICULTY IN A MONTH'S TIME FROM NOW IN REPLENISHING CELLARS BUT WE'VE HAD A GOOD SUPPLY ALL THE SUMMER ADDED AGREEABLE MISTER WOOTTEN AND ALL MY CUSTOMERS HAVE GOT THEIR CELLARS WELL STOCKED
BRIDGE AFTERWARDS I SUPPOSE SURE TO BE WISH THERE WAS A CHANCE OF MORE RED CURRANT FOOL THAT WAS A DECENT TIPPLE ALL BUT THE RED CURRANTS
AND THEN IF THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING IN THE EVENING PAPER PERHAPS I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT IT AND BLESS ME IF BY THAT TIME IT ISN'T ALREADY HALF PAST TEN OR ELEVEN AND IT SEEMS USELESS TO TACKLE ARCHOLOGY THEN AND I JUST
THREE TONS IN HER CELLAR AND AS SOON AS HER VISITOR HAD LEFT HER THIS MORNING SHE POPPED OUT TO SEE MISTER WOOTTEN HER COAL MERCHANT
IT WAS LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN MISS MAPP FELT THAT SHE WAS PHYSICALLY INCAPABLE OF TACKING ON A SINGLE POPPY MORE TO THE EDGE OF HER SKIRT AND WENT TO THE WINDOW OF THE GARDEN ROOM WHERE SHE HAD BEEN WORKING TO CLOSE IT
IT WAS ODD TO GO TO YOUR GROCER'S EVERY DAY LIKE THAT GROCERIES TWICE A WEEK WAS SUFFICIENT FOR MOST PEOPLE FROM HERE ON THE FLOOR ABOVE THE STREET SHE COULD EASILY LOOK INTO ELIZABETH'S BASKET AND SHE CERTAINLY WAS CARRYING NOTHING AWAY WITH HER FROM THE GROCER'S
HE RANG THE BELL AT MISS MAPP'S BACK DOOR
WITHOUT STOPPING TO EXAMINE THEM JUST THEN SHE ONLY KNEW THAT THEY WERE LITTLE PINK ROSES
I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST POP ACROSS FROM THE GROCER'S SHE SAID WHAT A PRETTY SCARF DEAR THAT'S A LOVELY SHADE OF ROSE MADDER WHERE CAN I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING LIKE IT BEFORE THIS WAS CLEARLY IRONICAL AND HAD BEST BE ANSWERED BY IRONY
THERE WAS A PERFECTLY PERCEPTIBLE PAUSE DURING WHICH MISS MAPP NOTICED THAT THERE WERE NO CURTAINS OVER THE WINDOW THERE CERTAINLY USED TO BE AND THEY MATCHED WITH THE CHINTZ COVER OF THE WINDOW SEAT
IT LAY EMBEDDED IN THE WALL OF THE GARDEN ROOM CLOAKED AND CONCEALED BEHIND THE SHELVES OF A FALSE BOOK CASE WHICH CONTAINED NO MORE THAN THE SIMULACRA OF BOOKS JUST BOOKS WITH TITLES THAT HAD NEVER YET APPEARED ON ANY HONEST BOOK
NOW NONE OF YOUR SAILOR TALK ASHORE CAPTAIN SAID THE MAJOR IN HIGH GOOD HUMOUR I'M NOT A MARRYING MAN ANY MORE THAN YOU ARE BETTER IF I HAD BEEN PERHAPS MORE YEARS AGO THAN I CARE TO THINK ABOUT DEAR ME MY WOUND'S GOING TO TROUBLE ME TO NIGHT
NO ONE CAN WORK AS NEATLY AS YOU WITHERS SHE SAID GAILY AND I SHALL ASK YOU TO DO THE MOST DIFFICULT PART I WANT YOU TO SEW MY LOVELY POPPIES OVER THE COLLAR AND FACINGS OF THE JACKET JUST SPACING THEM A LITTLE AND MAKING A DAINTY IRREGULARITY
OR RATHER NOT BRINGING IN THE SECOND POST BUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THERE WASN'T ANY SECOND POST THIS OPENING OF THE DOOR CAUSED A DRAUGHT AND THE BUNCHES OF ROSES WHICH LITTERED THE WINDOW SEAT ROSE BRIGHTLY IN THE AIR
BUT HOW MUCH DO THEY ALLOW YOU TO HAVE SHE ASKED OH QUITE A LITTLE ENOUGH TO GO ON WITH BUT I DARESAY THEY WON'T DISCOVER YOU I JUST TOOK THE TROUBLE TO COME AND WARN YOU
HER VOICE WAS TREMULOUS WITH ANXIETY AND INVESTIGATION GOT ANY BIG TINS OF CORNED BEEF THE ONES THAT CONTAIN SIX POUNDS
NEVER DRINK ALONE
JUST WHILE AWAY THE TIME TILL I'M SLEEPY BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A SORT OF LEGEND AMONG THE LADIES HERE THAT I'M A GREAT STUDENT OF LOCAL TOPOGRAPHY AND ROMAN ROADS AND ALL SORTS OF TRUCK AND I FIND IT BETTER TO LEAVE IT AT THAT TIRESOME TO GO INTO LONG EXPLANATIONS
HAVING PUT HER WINDOW OPEN SHE TROD SOFTLY SO AS NOT TO DISTURB THE SLUMBERER NEXT DOOR ACROSS HER ROOM ON HER FAT WHITE FEET TO HER BIG WHITE BED GOOD NIGHT MAJOR BENJY SHE WHISPERED AS SHE PUT HER LIGHT OUT
BUT NO MORE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT OF AN EVENING FOR BENJAMIN FLINT AS LONG AS YOU'RE AGREEABLE THE ADVENT OF THE TAXI WAS ANNOUNCED AND ARM IN ARM THEY LIMPED DOWN THE STEEP PATH TOGETHER TO THE ROAD
COULD BEAR TO THROW AWAY BROKEN BASKET CHAIRS PIECES OF BROWN PAPER CARDBOARD BOXES WITHOUT LIDS AND CARDBOARD LIDS WITHOUT BOXES OLD BAGS WITH HOLES IN THEM KEYS WITHOUT LOCKS AND LOCKS WITHOUT KEYS AND WORN CHINTZ COVERS
IT BECAME A MATTER OF THRILLING INTEREST AS TO WHERE SHE KEPT THESE STORES SHE COULD NOT KEEP THEM IN THE COAL CELLAR FOR THAT WAS ALREADY BURSTING WITH COAL
FOR SHE HAD BEEN OCCUPIED WITH ROSES EVER SINCE BREAKFAST THE ATTENDANT WAS AT THE TELEPHONE AT THE BACK OF THE SHOP HE SPOKE IN A LUCID TELEPHONE VOICE
IT INDICATED THAT HER INFLUENCE WAS AT WORK IN HIM FOR IN RESPONSE TO HER WISH SO OFTEN AND SO TACTFULLY URGED ON HIM THAT HE WOULD GO TO BED EARLIER AND NOT WORK SO HARD AT NIGHT HERE WAS THE DARKENED WINDOW AND SHE DISMISSED AS UNWORTHY
PUFFIN WAS SILENT A MOMENT IN APPRECIATION OF THESE NOBLE SENTIMENTS BUT YOU PUT IN A LOT OF WORK OVER THEM HE SAID AT LENGTH OFTEN WHEN I'M GOING UP TO BED I SEE THE LIGHT STILL BURNING IN YOUR SITTING ROOM WINDOW
POP IN CRUDE INVERTED COMMAS SO TO SPEAK FOR PURPOSES OF MOCKERY AND SO SHE SAID IT HERSELF MORE THAN EVER I'LL TELL MY MAID TO POP DOWN AND OPEN THE DOOR
AND THEY'VE JUST BEEN ORDERED A SMALL POT OF GINGER THEN PLEASE SAID DIVA RECKLESSLY WILL YOU SEND IT ROUND IMMEDIATELY YES MA'AM THE BOY'S JUST GOING OUT THAT WAS LUCK
AND WALKING SO SLOWLY THAT THE MOTION OF HER FEET SEEMED NOT CIRCULAR AT ALL THEN THE BELL WAS ANSWERED AND HE DELIVERED INTO WITHERS'S HANDS ONE TWO TINS OF CORNED BEEF AND A ROUND OX TONGUE
AND THE TWO NO LONGER ON SPEAKING TERMS HOBBLED INTO THE CLUB HOUSE ONE AFTER THE OTHER EACH UNCONSCIOUS OF THE OTHER'S PRESENCE SUMMONING HIS LAST REMAINING STRENGTH MAJOR FLINT ROARED FOR WHISKY AND WAS TOLD THAT ACCORDING TO REGULATION
EUREKA SAID MISS MAPP ALOUD AND THOUGH THE TELEPHONE BELL WAS RINGING AND THE POSTULANT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE SERVANTS FRIENDS RINGING THEM UP AT AN HOUR WHEN THEIR MISTRESS WAS USUALLY IN THE HIGH STREET
OH BUT MISTER WOOTTEN SHE SAID MISS MAPP POPPED DROPPED IN TO SEE ME JUST NOW TOLD ME SHE HAD HARDLY GOT ANY MISTER WOOTTEN TURNED UP HIS LEDGER IT WAS NOT ETIQUETTE TO DISCLOSE THE AFFAIRS OF ONE CLIENT TO ANOTHER
A LITTLE WAY OFF TO THE LEFT WAS THE GREAT BUNKER WHICH PRIMARILY WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR PRESENT AMITY
AND ALL THE TIME ELIZABETH'S OWN CELLARS WERE GLUTTED THOUGH SHE HAD ASSERTED THAT SHE WAS ALMOST FUELLESS
THE PATTERN WAS OF LITTLE BUNCHES OF PINK ROSES PEEPING OUT THROUGH TRELLIS WORK AND IT WAS THESE WHICH SHE HAD JUST BEGUN TO CUT OUT THOUGH TILLING WAS NOTED FOR THE INGENUITY WITH WHICH ITS MORE FASHIONABLE LADIES DEVISED NOVEL AND QUAINT EFFECTS IN THE DRESS IN AN ECONOMICAL MANNER
I'LL SERVE YOU WITH THE SAME SPOON SOME DAY AT LEAST I WOULD IF I THOUGHT IT SPORTSMANLIKE WELL WELL ENOUGH SAID ASTONISHING GOOD WHISKY THAT OF YOURS CAPTAIN PUFFIN HELPED HIMSELF TO RATHER MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT NOW REMAINED IN THE FLASK
SHE WOULD THINK YOU WERE INSULTING HER BLESS THEM THE FUNNY LITTLE FAIRIES SAID THE MAJOR WELL WHAT I TELL YOU IS TRUE MAJOR SAID PUFFIN THERE'S OLD MAPP TEETOTALLER SHE CALLS HERSELF
SHE RETURNED IN A STATE OF FURY FOR THERE WERE NO REGULATIONS WHATEVER IN EXISTENCE WITH REGARD TO THE AMOUNT OF COAL THAT ANY HOUSEHOLDER MIGHT CHOOSE TO AMASS AND MISTER WOOTTEN COMPLIMENTED HER ON HER PRUDENCE IN HAVING GOT IN A REASONABLE SUPPLY FOR HE THOUGHT IT QUITE PROBABLE THAT
DONE WITH YOU SAID THE OTHER THEIR COMRADESHIP WAS NOW ON ITS MOST FELICITOUS LEVEL AGAIN AND THEY SAT ON THE BENCH OUTSIDE THE CLUB HOUSE TILL THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR UNUSUAL CONVEYANCE LUNCHING AT THE POPPIT'S TO MORROW
THAT LED TO MISS MAPP'S HOUSE WAS VERY PROTRACTED AT THE CORNER HE DELIBERATELY PUT DOWN THE BASKET ALTOGETHER
AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SORRY IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET A DRINK HE TWIRLED HIS MOUSTACHE A GREAT MANY TIMES AND CLEARED HIS THROAT IT WANTED MORE THAN THAT TO CLEAR IT AND CAPITULATED UPON MY WORD PUFFIN
FOR SECRECY WAS AN ESSENTIAL TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE DECORATIONS BUT IN ORDER TO APPEAR NATURALLY EMPLOYED SHE PULLED OUT THE WOOLLEN SCARF SHE WAS KNITTING FOR THE AUTUMN AND WINTER
THERE CAME A LITTLE WAILING FAR AWAY IT WAS AND FAR NEARER IT DREW WAS THAT A TREMOR THAT PASSED THROUGH THE CROWDED CRATER A QUICK PULSE OF EAGERNESS HUNGRY
I THRUST MY ELBOW INTO HIS SIDE BRUTALLY NONE OF THAT REMEMBER YOU'RE HUMAN GUARD YOURSELF MAN GUARD YOURSELF WHAT HE MUTTERED THEN ABRUPTLY HOW DID YOU KNOW I FELT IT MYSELF I ANSWERED
UNCOILING EAGERLY AVIDLY THROUGH THE TWENTY FEET OF SPACE BETWEEN THEIR SOURCE AND THE ENIGMATIC MECHANISM THEY MANIPULATED THE CRATER'S DISKS TILTED DOWNWARD INTO THE VAST HOLLOW SHOT THEIR JETS OF GREEN RADIANCE
IT HOVERED A RECTANGLE FORTY FEET LONG AS MANY FEET OVER THE FLOOR AT THE BASE OF THE CRYSTAL PEDESTAL IT BENT AGAIN THIS TIME FROM THE HINGE THAT HELD THE OUTSTRETCHED ARMS TO THE BASE AND NOW IT WAS A HUGE TRUNCATED CROSS
I WAS CONSCIOUS OF A CURIOUSLY WILD EXHILARATION A QUICKENING OF THE PULSE AN ABNORMALLY RAPID BREATHING I STOOPED TO TOUCH DRAKE SPARKS LEAPED FROM MY OUTSTRETCHED FINGERS GREAT GREEN SPARKS
LOOK UP AT THE SUN SPOT THE BIG ONE I SEE IT HE HAD OBEYED ME WHAT OF IT NINE MINUTES THE SHAFT IF I WERE RIGHT HAD BY NOW TOUCHED THE SUN WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW
GOODWIN THE SPOT IT'S WIDENING IT'S WIDENING I SNATCHED THE GLASSES FROM HIM I CAUGHT AGAIN THE DAZZLING FLASHING
ON THEY SWEPT UNTIL THEY REACHED THE BASE OF THE CONES THEY PAUSED AT THE EDGE OF THE CRYSTAL TABLING THEY TURNED THERE WAS A FLASHING AS OF A METEOR BURSTING THE GLOBE HAD OPENED INTO THAT SPLENDOR OF JEWEL FIRES
LIGHTNINGS GREEN AS THE MISTS THEMSELVES LIGHTNING BOLTS OF DESTROYING VIOLETS SEARING SCARLETS TEARING CHAINS OF WITHERING YELLOWS GLOBES OF EXPLODING MULTICOLORED ELECTRIC INCANDESCENCES
AS ALIVE AS THEY FROM THESE BROBDIGNAGIAN BEAMS THEY SWUNG IN ROPES AND CLUSTERS SPHERES AND CUBES STUDDED AS THICKLY WITH THE PYRAMIDS AS EVER TITAN'S MACE WITH SPIKES GROUP AFTER BIZARRE GROUP THEY DROPPED PENDULOUS
AS THOUGH THEY GORGED THEMSELVES UPON THE LIGHT NO IT WAS AS THOUGH THE CORPUSCLES FLEW TO THEM COALESCED AND BUILT THEMSELVES INTO THE STRUCTURE OUT AND FURTHER OUT UPON THE BASE OF CRYSTAL THEY CREPT AND HIGHER AND HIGHER SOARED THEIR TIPS
IF WE COULD HAVE HANDLED THE KEEPER WE COULD HAVE SMASHED THAT PLATE THAT WORKS THE CONES WE COULD HAVE KILLED THEM THERE ARE OTHER CONES I CRIED BACK TO HIM NO HE SHOOK HIS HEAD THIS IS THE MASTER MACHINE IT'S WHAT VENTNOR MEANT
FASTER DANCED THE RADIANT BEAMS THE CRATER WAS A CAULDRON OF GREEN FIRES THROUGH WHICH THE CONICAL RAYS ANGLED AND INTERWOVE CROSSED AND MINGLED AND WHERE THEY MINGLED WHERE THEY CROSSED FLAMED OUT SUDDENLY IMMENSE RAYLESS ORBS
THRUST A MOUNTAINOUS FOREST OF THE PALLIDLY RADIANT CONES BRISTLING PRODIGIOUS TIER UPON TIER THICKET UPON THICKET PHALANX UPON PHALANX THEY CLIMBED UP AND UP PYRAMIDICALLY THEY FLUNG THEIR SPIKED HOSTS
DESTROYED THEM THINGS THAT COULD THRUST THEIR WILL AND POWER UP THROUGH NINETY MILLION MILES OF SPACE AND SUCK FROM THE SUN THE HONEY OF POWER
MADE ALLOWANCE FOR ITS POSSIBLE ACCELERATION BEGAN TO COUNT WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED DRAKE TAKE MY GLASSES I MUTTERED TRYING TO KEEP UP WHILE SPEAKING MY TALLY MATCHES IN MY POCKET SMOKE THE LENSES I WANT TO LOOK AT SUN
UPON EACH DISK SHONE CLEAR AS THOUGH SEEN THROUGH CLOUDS OF TRANSPARENT ATOMS OF AQUAMARINE AGAIN THE FILAMENTS OF THE KEEPER MOVED FEEBLY
WHAT POSSIBLE EFFECT COULD THAT SPEAR HAVE UPON THE SOLAR FORCES AND YET AND YET A GNAT'S BITE CAN DRIVE AN ELEPHANT MAD AND NATURE'S BALANCE IS DELICATE
I CALL THE METAL EMPEROR YET THIS THING ECLIPSED IT BLACK UNCOMPROMISING IN SOME INDEFINABLE WAY BRUTAL ITS SQUARE BULK BLOTTED OUT THE DISK'S EFFULGENCE SHROUDED IT
UP AND UP THE SHIELDS ROSE BUT BY WHAT MECHANISM RAISED I COULD NOT SEE THEIR MOTION CEASED IN ALL THEIR THOUSANDS THEY TURNED OVER THE CITY'S TOP AND OUT INTO THE OVAL VALLEY THEY POURED THEIR TORRENTS OF LIGHT
HUNG PENDENT CLUSTERS OF OTHER DISKS SWARMED LIKE THE GLOBULAR HIVING OF THE CONSTELLATION HERCULES CAPTURED STARS AND EACH OF THESE PRISONED THE IMAGE OF OUR SUN A HUNDRED FEET BELOW US WAS THE CRATER FLOOR UP FROM IT
OUT FROM THE DISKED WHEEL AT ITS SHORN TIP GUSHED A FLOOD OF LIGHT LIGHT THAT GATHERED ITSELF FROM THE LEAPING RADIANCE BELOW IT THE TENTACLES OF THE KEEPER MOVED MORE SWIFTLY OVER THE ENIGMATIC TABLET
DRAINED FROM IT TO FORGE THE THRUSTING SPEAR PIERCING SUNWARD THE METAL PEOPLE SEEMED TO HANG LIMPLY INERT THE LIVING GIRDERS SEEMED TO SAG THE LIVING COLUMNS TO BEND TO DROOP AND TO SWAY
CHANGING THEIR SHAPES REWRITING THEIR SYMBOLS THEY SWUNG AND THREADED SWIFTLY IN SHIFTING ARABESQUE IN GOTHIC TRACERIES IN LACE LIKE FANTASIES UTTERLY BIZARRE
I THOUGHT I SAW NORHALA FLOATING CLOTHED IN SHOUTING FLAILING FIRES I STROVE TO CALL OUT TO HER BY ME SLIPPED THE BODY OF DRAKE
A CLAMOR POURED IF WE'D BUT KNOWN DRAKE'S VOICE CAME TO ME THIN AND UNREAL THROUGH THE TUMULT IT'S WHAT VENTNOR MEANT IF WE HAD GOT DOWN THERE WHEN THEY WERE SO WEAK
A GLIMMERING MISTINESS WAS GATHERING A TRANSLUCENT MIST BERYL PALE AND BERYL CLEAR IN A HEART BEAT IT HAD THICKENED INTO A VAST AND VAPOROUS RING THROUGH WHOSE SWARMS OF CORPUSCLES THE SUN'S REFLECTED IMAGE
DESTROY THINGS THAT COULD FEED THEIR OWN LIFE INTO A MACHINE TO DRAW BACK FROM THE SUN A GREATER LIFE THINGS THAT COULD FORGE OF THEIR STRENGTH A SPEAR
THE RADIANT PILLAR HURTLED UPWARD LIKE A THUNDER BOLT VANISHED IN SPACE BEFORE US STOOD THE MOUNT OF CONES SHRUNKEN TO A SIXTH OF ITS FORMER SIZE SIXTEEN MINUTES ALL ABOUT THE CRATER LIP
AND A SHADOW SEEMED TO FALL UPON THE CRATER THE VIOLET FIRES OF THE FLANKING STARS PULSED OUT WATCHFULLY THREATENINGLY FOR ONLY AN INSTANT THE DARKENING BLOCK LOOMED AGAINST THE DISK BLACKENED IT
BUT IT WAS IN SIZE TO THAT AS AS LEVIATHAN TO A MINNOW FROM IT STREAMED THE SAME BAFFLING SUGGESTION OF INVINCIBLE FORCE TRANSMUTED INTO MATTER ENERGY COALESCED INTO THE TANGIBLE POWER MADE CONCENTRATE IN THE VESTMENTS OF SUBSTANCE
ITS MAGNETIC LIFE DRAINING INTO THE SHAFT OF GREEN FIRE DULLER GREW THE METAL EMPEROR'S GLORIES FOURTEEN MINUTES GOODWIN CRIED DRAKE THE LIFE'S GOING OUT OF THESE THINGS
FLOODING IT DELUGING IT EVEN AS THEY HAD THIS PIT THAT WAS THE CITY'S HEART FEEDING I KNEW THOSE OTHER METAL HORDES WITHOUT AND AS THOUGH IN ANSWER SWEEPING DOWN UPON US THROUGH THE CIRCLES OF OPEN SKY
WHISPERED DRAKE AGAIN LIKE A LOT OF LIONS WITH THE KEEPER COMING ALONG WITH MEAT THE WAILING WAS BELOW US I FELT NOT A QUIVER THIS TIME BUT AN UNMISTAKABLE SHOCK PASS THROUGH THE HORDE IT THROBBED AND PASSED
HE HUDDLED DOWN ONCE MORE CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF PEERING OVER NO ONE OF THE METAL PEOPLE HAD MOVED THE SILENCE THE STILLNESS WAS UNBROKEN NOW THE FLANKING PYRAMIDS SHOT FORTH INTO TWIN STARS
AND FAINTER STILL WERE THE VIOLET LUMINESCENCES OF THE WATCHING STARS THE SHIMMERING LIVERY OF HIS COURT THE KEEPER OF THE CONES WERE NOT ITS OUTSTRETCHED PLANES HOVERING LOWER AND LOWER OVER THE GLEAMING TABLET ITS TENTACLES MOVING AIMLESSLY FEEBLY
EVEN IF THAT THOUGHT WERE TRUE EVEN IF THAT PILLAR OF RADIANCE WERE A MESSENGER AN EARTH HURLED BOLT FLYING TO THE SUN THROUGH ATMOSPHERE AND OUTER SPACE WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT EVEN IF IT WERE THIS STUPENDOUS CREATION OF THESE THINGS STILL
AFTER THEM TEN SPHERES BUT LITTLE SMALLER THAN THE SHAPE WHICH LED
BRILLIANT EVER MORE BRILLIANT WAXED THE FAST THICKENING MISTS ABRUPTLY AND AGAIN AS ONE THE DISKS BEGAN TO REVOLVE FROM EVERY CONCAVE SURFACE
THE CRATER WAS THREADED WITH THE LIGHTNINGS OF THE METAL PEOPLE WAS BROIDERED WITH THEM WAS A PIT WOVEN WITH VAST AND CHANGING PATTERNS OF ELECTRIC FLAME WHAT WAS IT THAT DRAKE HAD SAID
I DON'T GET YOU AT ALL SAID DRAKE AND LOWERED THE GLASSES TEN MINUTES
AT THE EDGES I THOUGHT I COULD SEE GROOVINGS NOTED THE SAME APPEARANCES AT THE OUTLINES OF THE STARS SEEN SIDEWISE THE BODY OF THE METAL EMPEROR SHOWED AS A CONVEXITY ITS SURFACE SMOOTH WITH A SUGGESTION OF TRANSPARENCY
PYRAMID A FOUR POINTED STAR AND AS I HAD GLIMPSED IN THE PLAY OF THE LITTLE THINGS ABOUT NORHALA COULD SEE NOW SO PLAINLY IN THE KEEPER THE BLOCKS TOOK THIS INVERTED CRUCIFORM SHAPE THE METAL PEOPLE
AND CUBE OF THE METAL PEOPLE OPENING WIDE BATHING IN DRINKING FROM THE RADIANT MAELSTROM THAT FASTER AND EVER FASTER SWIRLED ABOUT THEM FEEDING IT WAS DRAKE'S AWED VOICE
THERE CAME ANOTHER METEOR BURST OF LIGHT WHERE THE CUBE HAD BEEN WAS NOW A TREMENDOUS FIERY CROSS A CROSS INVERTED ITS UPPER ARM AROSE TO TWICE THE LENGTH EITHER OF ITS HORIZONTALS OR THE SQUARE THAT WAS ITS FOOT
DID NOT THAT HYPOTHESIS BELONG TO THE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE EVEN WERE IT SO WHAT WAS IT THAT THE METAL MONSTER EXPECTED TO FOLLOW THIS RADIANT SHAFT COLOSSAL AS IT WAS TO US
THEY CLICKED INTO PLACE AROUND THE GOLDEN TURRET IN WHICH WE CROUCHED IN FANTASTIC ARRASES THEY SWAYED IN FRONT OF US NOW HIDING BY NOW REVEALING THROUGH THEIR QUICKSILVER INTERWEAVINGS THE MOUNTS OF THE CONES
FROM THE SURFACES OF THE HUGE CIRCLETS BELOW THEM FLASHED OUT A STREAM OF GREEN FIRE GREEN AS THE FIRE OF GREEN LIFE ITSELF CORPUSCULAR SPUN OF UNCOUNTED RUSHING DAZZLING IONS
TWELVE MINUTES WITH A NERVE RACKING CRASH ONE OF THE LADEN BEAMS FELL DRAGGING DOWN WITH IT OTHERS BENDING SHATTERING IN ITS FALL A THICKET OF THE HORNED COLUMNS BEHIND US
GOING OUT WITH THAT RAY THEY'RE SHOOTING FIFTEEN MINUTES I WATCHED THE TENTACLES OF THE KEEPER GROPE OVER THE TABLET ABRUPTLY THE FLAMING PYRAMID DARKENED WENT OUT
FOLDED THE OVAL DISK BECAME THE SPHERE THE FOUR POINTS OF THE STAR THE SQUARE FROM WHICH THOSE POINTS RADIATED SHUTTING BECAME THE PYRAMID THE SIX FACES OF THE CUBES WERE WHEN OPENED THE INVERTED CROSS
NOR WERE THESE FLEXIBLE MOBILE WALLS MASSIVE THEY WERE INDEED CONSIDERING THE APPARENT MASS OF THE METAL FOLK MOST ASTONISHINGLY FRAGILE THOSE OF THE KEEPER DESPITE ITS EIGHTY FEET OF HEIGHT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN A YARD IN THICKNESS
HE WAS CROUCHING DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE LIP OF THE LEDGE HANDS CLASPED AND KNUCKLES WHITE WITH THE INTENSITY OF HIS GRIP EYES RAPT STARING UPON THE VERGE OF WORSHIP EVEN AS I HAD BEEN DRAKE
WHISPERED DRAKE THEY'RE HUNGRY CLOSER WAS THE WAILING AGAIN THAT FAINT TREMOR QUIVERED OVER THE PLACE AND NOW I CAUGHT IT A QUICK AND AVID PULSING HUNGRY
WHEN HE SAID TO STRIKE THROUGH THE SUN AND WE'VE LOST THE CHANCE LOUDER GREW THE HURRICANE WITHOUT AND NOW WITHIN BEGAN ITS MATE THROUGH THE MISTS FLASHED LINKED TEMPESTS OF LIGHTNINGS BOLT UPON JAVELIN BOLT AND EVER MORE THICKLY
DOWN FROM THE IMMENSE WHEEL CAME POURING CATARACTS OF GREEN FIRES THEY CASCADED OVER THE CONES DELUGED THEM ENGULFED THEM BENEATH THAT RADIANT INUNDATION THE CONES GREW PERCEPTIBLY THEIR VOLUME INCREASED
DESTROYING LIKE ARMORED GODS ROARING AT SWORD PLAY IN A HUNDRED VALHALLAS LIKE THE WAR DRUMS OF BATTLING UNIVERSE LIKE THE SMITINGS OF WARRING SUNS AND ALL THE CITY WAS THROBBING
CRYSTALLINE GEOMETRIC ALWAYS ABRUPTLY THEIR MOVEMENT CEASED SO ABRUPTLY THAT THE STOPPAGE OF ALL THE ORDERED TURMOIL HAD THE QUALITY OF APPALLING SILENCE
A T SHAPED FIGURE HOVERING ONLY TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE PAVE DOWN FROM THE KEEPER
AN UNIMAGINABLE TAPESTRY BEDIGHT WITH INCREDIBLE BROIDERY THE METAL PEOPLE DRAPED THE VAST CUP PILLARED IT AS THOUGH IT WERE A TEMPLE GARNISHED IT WITH THEIR BODIES AS THOUGH IT WERE A SHRINE ACROSS THE FLOOR TOWARD THE CONES
DYING SOMETHING OF THAT HELLISH LONELINESS THAT DEMONIAC DESIRE FOR IMMOLATION THAT HAD ASSAILED US IN THE HAUNTED HOLLOW OF THE RUINS BEGAN TO CREEP OVER ME THE CROWDED CRATER WAS FAINTING THE LIFE WAS GOING OUT OF THE CITY
THE GREAT SUN SPOT OF THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN NINETEEN THE MOST ENORMOUS EVER RECORDED BY ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE FIVE MINUTES HAD GONE BY COMMON SENSE WHISPERED TO ME THERE WAS NO USE KEEPING MY EYES FIXED TO THE GLASSES
A HALF MILE ON HIGH AND ALL OF TWO THOUSAND FEET ACROSS RAN THE CIRCULAR LIP OF ITS VAST RIM ABOVE IT WAS A CIRCLE OF WHITE AND GLARING SKY IN WHOSE CENTER FLAMED THE SUN AND INSTANTLY
WAS SHRUNKEN THE PILLAR OF RADIANCE HAD NOT LESSENED BUT THE MECHANISM THAT WAS ITS SOURCE HAD RETREATED WHOLE YARDS WITHIN THE FIELD OF ITS CRYSTAL BASE AND THE METAL EMPEROR DULLED AND FAINT WERE HIS FIRES DIMMED HIS SPLENDORS
AND MISTER BOFFIN WAS THE HERO OF TEN MINUTES MISTER DAUBENY DETRACTED SOMETHING FROM THIS TRIUMPH BY THE OVERSTRAINED AND PERHAPS IRONIC PATHOS WITH WHICH HE DEPLORED THE LOSS OF HIS RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIEND'S SERVICES
HE HAD NO OTHER REMARK TO MAKE AND HE WAS SURE THAT THE HOUSE WOULD APPRECIATE THE COURSE WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO SEAT HIMSELF BELOW THE GANGWAY THE HOUSE CHEERED VERY LOUDLY
RISE I FORGIVE THEE THEN TURNING TO THE PERSIAN HE SAID FAIR LADY NOW YOU KNOW WHO I AM LEARN ALSO THAT I HAVE SENT NOUREDDIN TO BALSORA TO BE KING AND AS SOON AS ALL NECESSARY PREPARATIONS ARE MADE
HAVING ONCE YIELDED HE WAS EASILY PERSUADED TO TAKE A SECOND CUP AND A THIRD AND SO ON TILL HE NO LONGER KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING TILL NEAR MIDNIGHT THEY CONTINUED DRINKING LAUGHING AND SINGING TOGETHER
THE KING'S WRATH WAS KINDLED AGAINST NOUREDDIN HE ORDERED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD TO TAKE WITH HIM FORTY MEN TO PILLAGE NOUREDDIN'S HOUSE TO RASE IT TO THE GROUND AND TO BRING NOUREDDIN AND THE SLAVE TO HIM A DOORKEEPER NAMED SANGIAR
NOUREDDIN AND THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN FINDING THE WINE EXCELLENT DRANK OF IT FREELY AND WHILE DRINKING THEY SANG BOTH HAD FINE VOICES
IF IT IS THE TRUTH THEY TELL ME AND NOT FLATTERY IT IS TO YOU I OWE THE TRANSFORMATION MY DAUGHTER
AND ALL THREE ATE TOGETHER WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED EATING NOUREDDIN ASKED THE OLD MAN TO BRING THEM A BOTTLE OF WINE
WENT TO THE PRISON TO FETCH NOUREDDIN WHOM HE MOUNTED ON A WRETCHED HORSE WITHOUT A SADDLE ARRIVED AT THE PALACE SAOUY WENT IN TO THE KING LEAVING NOUREDDIN IN THE SQUARE
AND HAVE RENOUNCED WINE FOR EVER YOU WOULD HOWEVER DO US A GREAT SERVICE IN PROCURING US SOME SAID NOUREDDIN YOU NEED NOT TOUCH IT YOURSELF
THEN HE DESIRED THE FISHERMAN TO CHANGE CLOTHES WITH HIM
AND WHEN SOON AFTER THAT NOUREDDIN PROPOSED TO HAVE SOME OF THE LUSTRES LIT HE ANSWERED
WHEN THE VIZIR SAW
ASTOUNDED THAT HE SHOULD WISH TO PART FROM HER TOOK HER LUTE AND WITH TEARS IN HER EYES SANG HER REPROACHES TO ITS MUSIC
AND WHERE DO YOU GO NOW ASKED THE CALIPH WHEREVER THE HAND OF ALLAH LEADS ME SAID NOUREDDIN THEN IF YOU WILL LISTEN TO ME
THE KING GRANTED THESE REQUESTS AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAUSED UNIVERSAL GRIEF FOR THE MEMORY OF NOUREDDIN'S FATHER WAS STILL FRESH IN THE HEARTS OF HIS PEOPLE
SINCE THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN HAD BEEN TO THE BATH FIVE OR SIX DAYS AFTER HER PURCHASE THE VIZIR'S WIFE GAVE ORDERS THAT THE BATH SHOULD BE HEATED FOR HER
AND FED HIM ONLY ON BREAD AND WATER
NOR COULD THE NEIGHBOURS GIVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THEM WHEN THE KING HEARD THAT THEY HAD ESCAPED HE ISSUED A PROCLAMATION THAT A REWARD OF ONE THOUSAND GOLD PIECES WOULD BE GIVEN TO WHOEVER WOULD BRING HIM NOUREDDIN AND THE SLAVE
WHO EASILY AVOIDED A MISSILE FROM THE HAND OF A DRUNKEN MAN IT HIT AGAINST THE WALL AND BROKE INTO A THOUSAND PIECES SCHEIH IBRAHIM STILL MORE ENRAGED THEN WENT OUT TO FETCH A STICK
THE OLD MAN FURIOUS AT THIS INSOLENCE AS HE CONSIDERED IT
AND DETERMINED AT ONCE TO USE EVERY MEANS IN HIS POWER TO RETAIN HER FOR HIMSELF THE PERSIAN WAS EQUALLY CAPTIVATED BY NOUREDDIN AND SAID TO HERSELF THE VIZIR DOES ME TOO GREAT HONOUR IN BUYING ME FOR THE KING
WE STUDIED TOGETHER AND HAVE ALWAYS REMAINED THE BEST OF FRIENDS THOUGH FORTUNE WHILE MAKING HIM A KING LEFT ME A HUMBLE FISHERMAN
HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND IMMEDIATELY INVENTED AN EXCUSE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL HE SAID I MUST TELL YOU THAT FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AGO SCHEIH IBRAHIM TOLD ME THAT HE WISHED TO HAVE AN ASSEMBLY OF THE MINISTERS OF HIS MOSQUE
THEY HAVE NOT EXPECTED RELIEF FROM THE HANDS OF GREEKS BUT WILL TAKE IT WHEN IT COMES FROM GREEKS OR TROJANS WHAT WOULD MISTER TURNBULL SAY IN THIS DEBATE AND WHAT MISTER MONK MISTER TURNBULL WAS THE PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE
THOUGH UP TO THAT DATE NO CABINET MINISTER COULD WELL HAVE BEEN LESS KNOWN TO FAME THAN WAS MISTER BOFFIN WHAT WOULD THOSE LIBERALS DO WHO WOULD NATURALLY REJOICE IN THE DISESTABLISHMENT OF THE CHURCH
DETERMINED TO WATCH AND SEE WHO THE PEOPLE WERE AND WHAT THEY DID PRESENTLY SCHEIH IBRAHIM ASKED THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN IF ANYTHING WERE WANTING TO COMPLETE HER ENJOYMENT OF THE EVENING IF ONLY SHE SAID
AND TOOK THE CUP SHE OFFERED NOW THE OLD MAN ONLY MADE A PRETENCE OF RENOUNCING WINE
IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL MEN THAT NO FINER SPEECH THAN THAT DELIVERED BY HIM
THEY SKIRTED A GARDEN ENCLOSED BY A HIGH WALL THE GATE WAS SHUT BUT IN FRONT OF IT WAS AN OPEN VESTIBULE WITH A SOFA ON EITHER SIDE HERE SAID NOUREDDIN LET US PASS THE NIGHT AND RECLINING ON THE SOFAS THEY SOON FELL ASLEEP
AND ALIGHTED AT THE STEPS OF THE PALACE WHERE THE KING CAME TO GREET HIM THE VIZIR'S FIRST QUESTION WAS WHETHER NOUREDDIN WERE STILL ALIVE THE KING REPLIED THAT HE WAS AND HE WAS IMMEDIATELY LED FORTH THOUGH BOUND HAND AND FOOT
FOR LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND GOLD PIECES HE WILL NOT LET HER GO HE DECLARES THAT WHAT WITH MASTERS FOR HER INSTRUCTION AND FOR BODILY EXERCISES NOT TO SPEAK OF CLOTHING AND NOURISHMENT HE HAS ALREADY SPENT THAT SUM UPON HER
AS SOON THEN AS THE FAIR PERSIAN HAD PUT ON HER VEIL THEY FLED TOGETHER AND HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO GET OUT OF THE TOWN WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED AT THE MOUTH OF THE EUPHRATES THEY FOUND A SHIP JUST ABOUT TO START FOR BAGDAD
THAT HE HAD VOTED FOR THE PERMANENCE OF THE CHURCH ESTABLISHMENT AND HE MUST THEREFORE SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT THEN RATLER WHISPERED A FEW WORDS TO HIS NEIGHBOUR I KNEW THE WAY HE'D RUN
EVEN TO THE SHOES AND THE TURBAN TAKING THE TWO FISH IN HIS HAND HE RETURNED TO THE VIZIR WHO NOT RECOGNISING HIM WOULD HAVE SENT HIM ABOUT HIS BUSINESS LEAVING THE VIZIR AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
WHO REGARDED MISTER MONK AS THE HONESTEST AND MOST PATRIOTIC POLITICIAN OF THE DAY THE DEBATE WAS LONG AND STORMY BUT WAS PECULIARLY MEMORABLE FOR THE SKILL WITH WHICH MISTER DAUBENY'S HIGHER COLLEAGUES DEFENDED THE STEPS THEY WERE ABOUT TO TAKE
THROWING HIMSELF ON ME LIKE A MADMAN HE TORE ME FROM MY HORSE BEAT ME TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND LEFT ME IN THE STATE YOUR MAJESTY SEES SO SAYING SAOUY TURNED ASIDE HIS HEAD AND WEPT BITTERLY
THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN INCONSOLABLE AT HIS DEPARTURE
AND HE SHOULD WILLINGLY TAKE THIS BRIBE MISTER MONK SPOKE ALSO HE WOULD NOT HE SAID FEEL HIMSELF JUSTIFIED IN REFUSING THE ADDRESS TO THE CROWN PROPOSED BY MINISTERS
AT SIGHT OF THE GOLD SCHEIH IBRAHIM SET OFF AT ONCE TO EXECUTE THE COMMISSION ON HIS RETURN NOUREDDIN SAID WE HAVE STILL NEED OF CUPS TO DRINK FROM AND OF FRUIT IF YOU CAN PROCURE US SOME
AND GIVEN TO THE MERCHANT WHO BEFORE WITHDRAWING SAID SIR AS SHE IS DESTINED FOR THE KING I WOULD HAVE YOU OBSERVE THAT SHE IS EXTREMELY TIRED WITH THE LONG JOURNEY
MISTER BOFFIN HAD CERTAINLY NOT JOINED THE PRESENT MINISTRY SO HE SAID WITH THE VIEW OF DESTROYING THE CHURCH
AND IS FITTINGLY DRESSED YOU WILL SEE HOW MUCH HER BEAUTY WILL BE INCREASED
AND THAT HE WAS DESTROYED BY FEELINGS OF REGRET AND ALMOST OF REMORSE THE MINISTERS HELD A CABINET COUNCIL ON THE MONDAY MORNING AND IT WAS SUPPOSED AFTERWARDS THAT THAT ALSO HAD BEEN STORMY
SUCH A SEVERE BASTINADO WAS FIRST ADMINISTERED TO HIM THAT HE WAS LEFT MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WAS A VAST PAVILION WHOSE SUPERB SALOON HAD EIGHTY WINDOWS EACH WINDOW HAVING A LUSTRE
AND I AM GOING TO TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT IT WAIT HERE TILL I RETURN
WOULD TO HEAVEN EXCLAIMED THE WIFE OF THE VIZIR THAT WHAT YOU SAY WERE TRUE BUT NOUREDDIN HAS DECEIVED YOU AND HIS FATHER WILL SACRIFICE HIM IN VENGEANCE FOR THE WRONG HE HAS DONE
KHACAN WHO WAS BETTER ABLE TO JUDGE OF HER MERITS THAN THE DEALER WISHING TO BRING THE MATTER TO A CONCLUSION SENT FOR THE MERCHANT AND SAID TO HIM IT IS NOT FOR MYSELF THAT I WISH TO BUY YOUR SLAVE
COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL YOUR MISERABLE SLAVE HAS OFFENDED YOU AND CRAVES FORGIVENESS
FIRST FROM A DISTANCE THEN HE DREW NEARER AND FINALLY PUT HIS HEAD IN AT THE DOOR NOUREDDIN SEEING HIM CALLED TO HIM TO COME IN AND KEEP THEM COMPANY AT FIRST THE OLD MAN DECLINED
YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY RETURN TO BALSORA I WILL GIVE YOU A LETTER TO THE KING WHICH WILL ENSURE YOU A GOOD RECEPTION FROM HIM IT IS AN UNHEARD OF THING SAID NOUREDDIN THAT A FISHERMAN SHOULD BE IN CORRESPONDENCE WITH A KING LET NOT THAT ASTONISH YOU
FIRST IN GIVING THE PERMISSION SECOND IN NOT MENTIONING IT TO ME AND THIRD IN NOT INVESTIGATING THE MATTER MORE CLOSELY FOR PUNISHMENT I CONDEMN YOU TO SPEND THE REST OF THE NIGHT WITH ME IN COMPANY OF THESE WORTHY PEOPLE
SAYING THAT HIS MOTHER HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE ADMITTED TAKING EACH BY AN ARM HE PUT THEM OUT OF THE ANTEROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR THEN THEY RUSHED TO THE BATH INFORMING THEIR MISTRESS WITH SHRIEKS AND TEARS
SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT ADDRESS WAS FOUNDED ON THE PROPOSITION OF A FUTURE REFORM AS TO THE EXPEDIENCY OF WHICH HE HAD NOT FOR MANY YEARS ENTERTAINED A DOUBT
AND ASKED PERMISSION TO HOLD IT IN THE PAVILION I GRANTED HIS REQUEST BUT FORGOT SINCE TO MENTION IT TO YOUR MAJESTY GIAFAR
BUT THIS TOO HE DECLINED SAYING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED THERE HE PREFERRED NEVER TO RETURN BUT TO ENTER THE SERVICE OF THE CALIPH HE
WOULD RECEIVE THE BULK OF WHAT WAS LEFT AFTER EXISTING INTERESTS HAD BEEN AMPLY GUARANTEED THERE WOULD BE NO DOUBT SO SAID THESE GENTLEMEN THAT AMPLE FUNDS FOR THE SUPPORT OF AN EPISCOPAL CHURCH
AND HAD THE GIFT OF CHARMING ALL WITH WHOM HE CAME IN CONTACT AS SOON AS HE SAW THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN THOUGH AWARE THAT SHE WAS DESTINED FOR THE KING HE LET HIMSELF BE CARRIED AWAY BY HER CHARMS
I WILL INTEREST HIM AT THE SAME TIME IN YOUR BEHALF AND THIS WILL BE WORTH MUCH MORE TO YOU THAN WHAT EXTRA MONEY YOU MIGHT OBTAIN FROM THE MERCHANTS BAD OLD MAN HE EXCLAIMED
I WILL SEND YOU THERE TO BE QUEEN MEANWHILE I WILL GIVE YOU AN APARTMENT IN MY PALACE WHERE YOU WILL BE TREATED WITH ALL HONOUR AT THIS THE BEAUTIFUL PERSIAN TOOK COURAGE
CERTAINLY BUT NOUREDDIN HAS JUST BEEN TO TELL ME THAT HIS FATHER HAS CHANGED HIS MIND AND HAS BESTOWED ME UPON HIM I BELIEVED HIM AND SO GREAT IS MY AFFECTION FOR NOUREDDIN THAT I WOULD WILLINGLY PASS MY LIFE WITH HIM
SCHEIH IBRAHIM WHATEVER IS IN THE PURSE I WILL SHARE EQUALLY WITH YOU BUT AS TO THE SLAVE I WILL KEEP HER FOR MYSELF IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE CONDITIONS YOU SHALL HAVE NOTHING
THE TIME FOR IT HAD CLEARLY GONE BY THE CHURCH AS A CHURCH WOULD OWN INCREASED POWER WHEN IT COULD APPOINT ITS OWN BISHOPS AND BE WHOLLY DISSEVERED FROM STATE PATRONAGE
HIS WIFE TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM SAYING DO NOT TORMENT THYSELF WITH THE SALE OF MY JEWELS I WILL OBTAIN TEN THOUSAND GOLD PIECES AND WITH THIS SUM
THIS MAN IS DECLARED TO BE UNFIT FOR ANY POSITION OF NOTE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS SHOWS TEMPER ANYTHING CAN BE DONE WITH ANOTHER MAN HE CAN BE MADE TO FIT ALMOST ANY HOLE BECAUSE HE HAS HIS TEMPER UNDER COMMAND
WHEN GRESHAM INSISTED ON POOR OLD MILDMAY'S TAKING HIM INTO THE CABINET THE WHOLE THING HAS GONE TO THE DOGS SAID BONTEEN ON THE FOURTH NIGHT THE HOUSE WAS DIVIDED
WAS ALL THE HONESTY ALL THE TRUTH OF THE GREAT PARTY CONFINED TO THE BOSOMS OF MISTER BOFFIN AND LORD DRUMMOND DOUBTLESS THEY WERE ALL ESAUS BUT WOULD THEY SELL THEIR GREAT BIRTHRIGHT FOR SO VERY SMALL A MESS OF POTTAGE
HE WENT SOFTLY UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN AT THE HALF CLOSED DOOR OF THE SALOON GREAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO SEE SCHEIH IBRAHIM
BUT DARED NOT WITHOUT THE KING'S AUTHORITY TO GAIN THIS END HE LOADED SEVERAL OF HIS OWN SLAVES WITH RICH GIFTS AND PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THEIR HEAD TO THE KING
OF WHICH THEY MADE SO TEMPTING A DISH THAT NOUREDDIN AND THE FAIR PERSIAN ATE OF IT WITH GREAT RELISH WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED NOUREDDIN TOOK THIRTY GOLD PIECES ALL THAT REMAINED OF WHAT SANGIAR HAD GIVEN HIM
AS TO THE ENDOWMENTS THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION OF IDEAS BUT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE WITH THEM INAPPROPRIATE TO RELIGION EDUCATION
THE FORMULA IS ABSENT BESIDES HE HAS NOT SENT AN EXPRESS WITH THE PATENT WITHOUT WHICH THE LETTER IS USELESS LEAVE ALL TO ME AND I WILL TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES
WHILE HE WAS GONE NOUREDDIN AND THE PERSIAN WANDERED THROUGH THE GARDENS AND WENT UP THE WHITE MARBLE STAIRCASE OF THE PAVILION AS FAR AS THE LOCKED DOOR OF THE SALOON ON THE RETURN OF SCHEIH IBRAHIM
THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO LONGER THAT STURDY ADHERENCE TO THEIR CHIEF WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE SOLIDARITY OF A PARTY PERHAPS NO LEADER OF THE HOUSE WAS EVER MORE DEVOUTLY WORSHIPPED BY A SMALL NUMBER OF ADHERENTS THAN WAS MISTER GRESHAM NOW
SEEING THAT YOU ARE FEASTING WITH YOUR FRIENDS I BRING YOU THESE FISH NOUREDDIN AND THE PERSIAN SAID THAT WHEN THE FISHES WERE PROPERLY COOKED AND DRESSED THEY WOULD GLADLY EAT OF THEM
RATLER HIMSELF ALMOST FELT THAT HE LOVED THE CHURCH ONLY TWO RESIGNATIONS WHEREAS IT HAD BEEN EXPECTED THAT THE WHOLE HOUSE WOULD FALL TO PIECES WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE EARLS
AND BEFORE PRESENTING HER TO HIS MAJESTY YOU WOULD DO WELL TO KEEP HER A FORTNIGHT IN YOUR OWN HOUSE AND TO SEE THAT A LITTLE CARE IS BESTOWED UPON HER THE SUN HAS TANNED HER COMPLEXION BUT WHEN SHE HAS BEEN TWO OR THREE TIMES TO THE BATH
CALLED TO THE EXECUTIONER TO STRIKE AT ONCE THE KING HOWEVER ORDERED HIM TO DELAY NOT ONLY WAS HE JEALOUS OF SAOUY'S INTERFERENCE BUT HE HAD ANOTHER REASON A TROOP OF HORSEMEN WAS SEEN AT THAT MOMENT RIDING AT FULL GALLOP TOWARDS THE SQUARE
AND ON HIS ARRIVAL THERE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE OF THE KING OF WHOM HE DEMANDED AN AUDIENCE IT WAS IMMEDIATELY GRANTED AND HOLDING THE LETTER HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD HE FORCED HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD
YOU SEEM TO FIND THAT A VERY GREAT SUM FOR YOU IT MAY BE SO BUT NOT FOR ME
IT MAY INDEED BE ASSUMED THAT A MAN WHO LOSES HIS TEMPER WHILE HE IS SPEAKING IS ENDEAVOURING TO SPEAK THE TRUTH SUCH AS HE BELIEVES IT TO BE AND AGAIN IT MAY BE ASSUMED THAT A MAN WHO SPEAKS CONSTANTLY WITHOUT LOSING HIS TEMPER
THIS PENETRATION OF THE SHADOWS IS INDESCRIBABLY SINISTER IN THE CASE OF A CHILD
TO THEIR PLACE BUT WILL IT NOT BE SAFER FOR YOU THERE AMONG YOUR KIND I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WILL I ANSWERED PROMPTLY THOSE WHO ARE UNLIKE US
FEAR HAD LENT HER AUDACITY BAH SAID SHE I WILL TELL HIM THAT THERE WAS NO MORE WATER
MAKE THE HOLY LAND VISIBLE TO YOU AND ARE SO TO SPEAK THE VERY FORM OF FRANCE AND YOU LOVE THEM AND YOU CALL THEM UP AS THEY ARE AS THEY WERE AND YOU PERSIST IN THIS AND YOU WILL SUBMIT TO NO CHANGE
SHE WAS IN A STATE OF SUCH VIOLENT EXCITEMENT THAT HER STRENGTH WAS TREBLED WHILE THUS BENT OVER SHE DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE POCKET OF HER APRON HAD EMPTIED ITSELF INTO THE SPRING
MOREOVER AND THIS IS A REMARK TO WHICH WE SHALL FREQUENTLY HAVE OCCASION TO RECUR SHE HAD GROWN USED WITHOUT BEING HERSELF AWARE OF IT TO THE PECULIARITIES OF THIS GOOD MAN AND TO THE FREAKS OF DESTINY
IT HAD BEEN HARD TO ADVANCE FURTHER THAN THE LAST STALL IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED FURTHER THAN THE LAST HOUSE SHE SET HER BUCKET ON THE GROUND THRUST HER HAND INTO HER HAIR AND BEGAN SLOWLY TO SCRATCH HER HEAD
FOLLOW IT HE POINTED TAKE THOSE WHO CAME WITH YOU AND FOLLOW IT
HE IS UNACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW PARIS AND HE WRITES WITH THE OLD PARIS BEFORE HIS EYES IN AN ILLUSION WHICH IS PRECIOUS TO HIM IT IS A DELIGHT TO HIM TO DREAM THAT THERE STILL LINGERS BEHIND HIM SOMETHING OF THAT WHICH HE BEHELD
IT WAS THE OPEN FIELDS BLACK AND DESERT SPACE WAS BEFORE HER SHE GAZED IN DESPAIR AT THAT DARKNESS WHERE THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ONE WHERE THERE WERE BEASTS
I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY TO THEM HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET CLASPED MY WRIST IN ONE OF HIS LONG HANDS LED ME THROUGH THE CURTAINED OVAL INTO THE CYLINDRICAL HALL
ALL THOSE PLACES WHICH YOU NO LONGER BEHOLD WHICH YOU MAY NEVER BEHOLD AGAIN PERCHANCE AND WHOSE MEMORY YOU HAVE CHERISHED TAKE ON A MELANCHOLY CHARM RECUR TO YOUR MIND WITH THE MELANCHOLY OF AN APPARITION
THERE ARE INSTINCTS FOR ALL THE ENCOUNTERS OF LIFE
SHADOWS AND TREES TWO FORMIDABLE DENSITIES
AND THEN SHE WAS WITH HIM AND SHE FELT SAFE JEAN VALJEAN KNEW NO MORE WHERE HE WAS GOING THAN DID COSETTE HE TRUSTED IN GOD AS SHE TRUSTED IN HIM
STANDS TO DAY AND WHERE THE RUE
SO LONG AS SHE HAD THE HOUSES OR EVEN THE WALLS ONLY ON BOTH SIDES OF HER PATH SHE PROCEEDED WITH TOLERABLE BOLDNESS FROM TIME TO TIME SHE CAUGHT THE FLICKER OF A CANDLE THROUGH THE CRACK OF A SHUTTER THIS WAS LIGHT AND LIFE
AND NO HUMAN IMAGINATION COULD HAVE CONCEIVED IT NOR HUMAN HANDS HAVE MADE ITS THOUGHT OF BEAUTY REAL WHAT WERE THEIR SENSES THROUGH WHICH THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS FED
AN OVOID SLICE OF THE GEMLIKE MATERIAL SLID ASIDE REVEALING A DOORWAY I GLIMPSED A PATH A TRAIL LEADING INTO A FOREST PALLID GREEN BENEATH THE WAN LIGHT
AT ANY RATE THE GODDESS WAS BORN SHEDDER OF THE LIGHTNINGS EVEN FROM HER BIRTH
EQUALLY OF COURSE ALEXANDER VENTNOR HAD BEEN RIGHT YURUK I DEMANDED DIRECTLY IS SHE WHOM YOU CALL GODDESS NORHALA OF THE PEOPLE OF CHERKIS
ONE IS AFRAID TO GLANCE BEHIND HIM YET DESIROUS OF DOING SO THE CAVITIES OF NIGHT THINGS GROWN HAGGARD TACITURN PROFILES WHICH VANISH WHEN ONE ADVANCES OBSCURE DISHEVELMENTS IRRITATED TUFTS
LIMITED IN ITS EXPRESSION ONLY BY THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT WHICH ANIMATES AND IN ESSENCE THE SAME IN ALL IF SO
YOU LOVE US AS THE WHEAT FIELD LOVES THE HAIL WE ARE AS WELCOME TO YOU AS THE DEATH CORD TO THE CONDEMNED LO A DOOR OPENED INTO A LAND OF UNPLEASANT DREAMS YOU THOUGHT SEALED AND WE CAME THROUGH
THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK WHO REGRETS THE NECESSITY OF MENTIONING HIMSELF HAS BEEN ABSENT FROM PARIS FOR MANY YEARS PARIS HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED SINCE HE QUITTED IT A NEW CITY HAS ARISEN WHICH IS AFTER A FASHION
A SELF REALIZING FORCE WHICH USES THE BODY AS ITS VEHICLE JUST AS OTHER FORCES USE FOR THEIR VESTMENTS OTHER MACHINES AFTER ALL I THOUGHT WHAT IS THIS CONSCIOUS SELF OF OURS
THE ONE WHO APPEARED TO BE THEIR LEADER TURNED ROUND AND POINTED HASTILY WITH HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE DIRECTION WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAD TAKEN ANOTHER SEEMED TO INDICATE THE CONTRARY DIRECTION WITH CONSIDERABLE OBSTINACY
HE MUTTERED NOR DOES IT PASS THROUGH THEM I CAN SHOW IT TO YOU I HAD NOT BEEN BLIND TO THE FLASH OF MALICE OF CUNNING THAT HAD SHOT ACROSS THE WRINKLED FACE
THE LASHLESS LIDS HALF CLOSED YES HE SAID SULLENLY
THERE WAS A FAMILIAR SOUND TO THAT CHERKIS OF COURSE IT WAS THE NAME OF XERXES THE PERSIAN CONQUEROR CORRUPTED BY TIME INTO THIS CHERKIS AND ISKANDER
THE MOON CAST A LIVID LIGHT INTO THIS OPEN SPACE
IN THIS MANNER SHE REACHED THE SPRING IT WAS A NARROW NATURAL BASIN HOLLOWED OUT BY THE WATER IN A CLAYEY SOIL ABOUT TWO FEET DEEP
CLEAVE TO YOUR KIND CLEAVE TO YOUR KIND SUDDENLY HE SHRILLED
FINDING NOTHING WHICH SUITED HIM HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT IF ANY ONE HAD CHANCED TO BE UPON HIS TRACK THEY WOULD HAVE LOST IT
ON ALL SIDES THERE WERE LUGUBRIOUS STRETCHES THE DARKNESS WAS BEWILDERING MAN REQUIRES LIGHT WHOEVER BURIES HIMSELF IN THE OPPOSITE OF DAY FEELS HIS HEART CONTRACT
WITH WHICH SHE WAS UNFAMILIAR AND WHICH TERRIFIED HER THE PLANET WAS IN FACT VERY NEAR THE HORIZON AND WAS TRAVERSING A DENSE LAYER OF MIST WHICH IMPARTED TO IT A HORRIBLE RUDDY HUE
AND HER MOTHER NO DOUBT ALAS FOR THERE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE THE DEAD OPEN THEIR EYES IN THEIR GRAVES SHE PANTED WITH A SORT OF PAINFUL RATTLE SOBS CONTRACTED HER THROAT BUT SHE DARED NOT WEEP
COSETTE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD IT FALL SHE DREW OUT THE BUCKET NEARLY FULL AND SET IT ON THE GRASS THAT DONE SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE
SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SET OUT AGAIN AT ONCE BUT THE EFFORT REQUIRED TO FILL THE BUCKET HAD BEEN SUCH THAT SHE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A STEP SHE WAS FORCED TO SIT DOWN SHE DROPPED ON THE GRASS AND REMAINED CROUCHING THERE
ALL WERE TALL DRESSED IN LONG BROWN COATS WITH ROUND HATS AND HUGE CUDGELS IN THEIR HANDS THEIR GREAT STATURE AND THEIR VAST FISTS RENDERED THEM NO LESS ALARMING THAN DID THEIR SINISTER STRIDE THROUGH THE DARKNESS
SHE IS ONLY A WOMAN HE SPAT IN A WAY THAT MADE ME WANT TO KILL HIM BESIDES HE ENDED HAVE YOU NO ARTS TO AMUSE HIM CHERKIS I ASKED
AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE BEGAN AGAIN THIS RESTORED HER TO A TRUE PERCEPTION OF THE THINGS ABOUT HER HER HANDS WHICH SHE HAD WET IN DRAWING THE WATER FELT COLD SHE ROSE
HE COULD NOT FAIL TO GET A GOOD LOOK AT THEM AS THEY TRAVERSED THIS ILLUMINATED SPACE IN POINT OF FACT THREE MINUTES HAD NOT ELAPSED WHEN THE MEN MADE THEIR APPEARANCE THERE WERE FOUR OF THEM NOW
WITHOUT KNOWING WHY BUT BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THE AGITATED WATER IN THE BUCKET BESIDE HER WAS DESCRIBING CIRCLES WHICH RESEMBLED TIN SERPENTS OVERHEAD THE SKY WAS COVERED WITH VAST BLACK CLOUDS
AT THAT MOMENT SHE SUDDENLY BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT HER BUCKET NO LONGER WEIGHED ANYTHING AT ALL A HAND WHICH SEEMED TO HER ENORMOUS HAD JUST SEIZED THE HANDLE AND LIFTED IT VIGOROUSLY SHE RAISED HER HEAD
AGAIN SHE WAS OBLIGED TO PAUSE AFTER SOME SECONDS OF REPOSE SHE SET OUT AGAIN SHE WALKED BENT FORWARD WITH DROOPING HEAD LIKE AN OLD WOMAN THE WEIGHT OF THE BUCKET STRAINED AND STIFFENED HER THIN ARMS
WHY IT'S DAWN HE WHISPERED GOODWIN YOU OUGHT NOT TO HAVE LET ME SLEEP SO LONG I FEEL LIKE A DAMNED PIG NEVER MIND I SAID BUT WATCH THE EUNUCH CLOSELY
ON ARRIVING NEAR AN OLD CHESTNUT TREE WITH WHICH SHE WAS ACQUAINTED MADE A LAST HALT LONGER THAN THE REST IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT GET WELL RESTED
ANSWER MY QUESTIONS TRUTHFULLY AND IT MAY BE THAT WE SHALL RETURN THROUGH THAT DOOR INTEREST WELLED UP IN THE DEPTHS OF THE BLACK EYES
LATER ON WHEN YOU ARE NO LONGER THERE YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE STREETS ARE DEAR TO YOU
IS IT A WEREWOLF CHILD THEN THE WOMAN RECOGNIZED COSETTE WELL SAID SHE IT'S THE LARK
ONE KNOWS NOT WHAT VAGUE AND INTANGIBLE THING LIKE THE DREAMS OF SLEEPING FLOWERS THERE ARE FIERCE ATTITUDES ON THE HORIZON
WAS NOT THE FATHER OF ISKANDER THE GOD ZEUS AMMON WHO CAME TO ISKANDER'S MOTHER IN THE FORM OF A GREAT SNAKE
THE EGO BUT A SPARK OF REALIZATION RUNNING CONTINUOUSLY ALONG THE PATH OF TIME WITHIN THE MECHANISM WE CALL THE BRAIN MAKING CONTACT ALONG THAT PATH AS THE ELECTRIC SPARK AT THE END OF A WIRE
THAT HE WISHED TO BE AS IT WOULD SEEM HE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS THE ONLY HUMAN THING NEAR NORHALA FAILED TO REALIZE THIS AND WITH RUTH AND DRAKE WAS TERRIBLY TO PAY FOR THIS FAILURE
HER TERROR A NATURAL AND UNCONQUERABLE TERROR HAD RETURNED SHE HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT NOW TO FLEE AT FULL SPEED THROUGH THE FOREST ACROSS THE FIELDS TO THE HOUSES TO THE WINDOWS TO THE LIGHTED CANDLES
AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A SQUARE FORMED BY THE INTERSECTION OF STREETS
CEASED TO BE A PROBLEM WAS ANSWERED SO THINKING I BECAME AWARE OF INCREASING LIGHT STRODE PAST YURUK TO THE DOOR AND PEEPED OUT DAWN WAS PALING THE SKY
A GESTURE PECULIAR TO CHILDREN WHEN TERRIFIED AND UNDECIDED WHAT TO DO
IS YURUK A FOOL NOT TO KNOW THAT IN THE WORLD WITHOUT
JEAN VALJEAN COULD GLIDE ALONG CLOSE TO THE HOUSES ON THE DARK SIDE AND YET KEEP WATCH ON THE LIGHT SIDE HE DID NOT PERHAPS TAKE SUFFICIENTLY INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THE DARK SIDE ESCAPED HIM STILL
HE HAD JUST PULLED HER RIGHT OUT WHEN THE OTHER SINNERS IN THE LAKE SEEING HOW SHE WAS BEING DRAWN OUT
THAT'S THE EXPLANATION OF THE MYSTERY AGAIN ALYOSHA SEEMED NOT TO HEAR RAKITIN COULD NOT CONTROL HIMSELF
HAVEN'T I MANAGED TO PLEASE YOU ASKED RAKITIN INSTANTLY ALMOST OFFENDED YOU FRIGHTENED ME RAKITIN THAT'S WHAT IT IS GRUSHENKA TURNED WITH A SMILE TO ALYOSHA DON'T BE AFRAID OF ME MY DEAR ALYOSHA
IF HE KNEW THERE WOULD BE MURDER BUT I AM NOT AFRAID OF THAT NOW I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIS KNIFE BE QUIET RAKITIN DON'T REMIND ME OF DMITRI FYODOROVITCH HE HAS BRUISED MY HEART AND I DON'T WANT TO THINK OF THAT AT THIS MOMENT
THERE'S NO FEAR OF YOUR REFUSING IT YOU ASKED FOR IT YOURSELF AND SHE THREW THE NOTE TO HIM LIKELY I SHOULD REFUSE IT BOOMED RAKITIN OBVIOUSLY ABASHED BUT CARRYING OFF HIS CONFUSION WITH A SWAGGER
AND YOU MAKE ME ASHAMED IF YOU PRAISE ME EH I MUST CONFESS EVERYTHING LISTEN ALYOSHA I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GET HOLD OF YOU THAT I PROMISED RAKITIN TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES IF HE WOULD BRING YOU TO ME STAY RAKITIN WAIT
SHE STARTED UP AS THOUGH IN DISMAY INSTANTLY SLIPPED OFF HIS KNEE AND SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA ALYOSHA BENT A LONG WONDERING LOOK UPON HER AND A LIGHT SEEMED TO DAWN IN HIS FACE RAKITIN
I AM STILL AFRAID OF YOUR BEING ANGRY YES THAT'S REALLY TRUE RAKITIN PUT IN SUDDENLY WITH GENUINE SURPRISE
PERHAPS MY HEART IS ONLY GETTING READY TO FORGIVE I SHALL STRUGGLE WITH MY HEART YOU SEE ALYOSHA I'VE GROWN TO LOVE MY TEARS IN THESE FIVE YEARS PERHAPS I ONLY LOVE MY RESENTMENT

THAT IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAT'S A WOMAN'S WAY OF LOOKING AT IT DON'T YOU MAKE ME ANGRY RAKITIN GRUSHENKA CAUGHT HIM UP HOTLY THIS IS QUITE DIFFERENT I LOVE ALYOSHA IN A DIFFERENT WAY
OF LATE WHEN DMITRI TOO HAD COME ON THE SCENE WITH HIS LOVE THE OLD MAN LEFT OFF LAUGHING ON THE CONTRARY HE ONCE GAVE GRUSHENKA A STERN AND EARNEST PIECE OF ADVICE IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO FATHER OR SON
ENDED TO HIS OWN SURPRISE BY FALLING MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER OLD SAMSONOV GRAVELY ILL AS HE WAS WAS IMMENSELY AMUSED IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THROUGHOUT THEIR WHOLE ACQUAINTANCE GRUSHENKA WAS ABSOLUTELY AND SPONTANEOUSLY OPEN WITH THE OLD MAN
WHY ARE YOU SO DEPRESSED ALYOSHA ARE YOU AFRAID OF ME SHE PEEPED INTO HIS EYES WITH MERRY MOCKERY HE'S SAD THE PROMOTION HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN
AH HE'S SMILING HE'S SMILING HOW KINDLY HE LOOKS AT ME AND YOU KNOW ALYOSHA I'VE BEEN THINKING ALL THIS TIME YOU WERE ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE OF THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BECAUSE OF THAT YOUNG LADY I WAS A CUR THAT'S THE TRUTH
YOU CANNOT THINK HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU MY UNEXPECTED VISITOR BUT YOU FRIGHTENED ME RAKITIN I THOUGHT IT WAS MITYA BREAKING IN YOU SEE I DECEIVED HIM JUST NOW I MADE HIM PROMISE TO BELIEVE ME AND I TOLD HIM A LIE
I'LL HAVE SOME TOO FENYA FENYA BRING US THE BOTTLE MITYA LEFT LOOK SHARP THOUGH I AM SO STINGY I'LL STAND A BOTTLE NOT FOR YOU RAKITIN YOU'RE A TOADSTOOL BUT HE IS A FALCON AND THOUGH MY HEART IS FULL OF SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT SO BE IT

WHEN YOU'VE HAD A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE YOU'LL BE READY TO DANCE EH THEY CAN'T EVEN DO THAT PROPERLY HE ADDED LOOKING AT THE BOTTLE
I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS GOING TO SPEND THE EVENING WITH MY OLD MAN KUZMA KUZMITCH AND SHOULD BE THERE TILL LATE COUNTING UP HIS MONEY I ALWAYS SPEND ONE WHOLE EVENING A WEEK WITH HIM MAKING UP HIS ACCOUNTS
THERE WERE RUMORS THAT SHE HAD BEEN AT SEVENTEEN BETRAYED BY SOME ONE SOME SORT OF OFFICER AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS ABANDONED BY HIM
AND NOW ALYOSHA I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE TRUTH THAT YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WRETCH I AM
WE LOCK OURSELVES IN AND HE COUNTS ON THE RECKONING BEADS WHILE I SIT AND PUT THINGS DOWN IN THE BOOK I AM THE ONLY PERSON HE TRUSTS MITYA BELIEVES THAT I AM THERE BUT I CAME BACK AND HAVE BEEN SITTING LOCKED IN HERE EXPECTING SOME NEWS
AND AFTERWARDS HAD MADE OUT OF THEM TEN TIMES THEIR VALUE THE OLD WIDOWER SAMSONOV A MAN OF LARGE FORTUNE WAS STINGY AND MERCILESS HE TYRANNIZED OVER HIS GROWN UP SONS BUT FOR THE LAST YEAR DURING WHICH HE HAD BEEN ILL
THE GREAT GRIEF IN HIS HEART SWALLOWED UP EVERY SENSATION THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AROUSED
I HAD A DIFFERENT OBJECT ONCE BUT NOW THAT'S OVER THIS IS NOT THE MOMENT I SAY I WANT YOU TO HAVE SOMETHING NICE I AM SO GOOD NATURED NOW YOU SIT DOWN TOO RAKITIN WHY ARE YOU STANDING YOU'VE SAT DOWN ALREADY
WELL IF SO I WON'T EITHER CHIMED IN GRUSHENKA I REALLY DON'T WANT ANY YOU CAN DRINK THE WHOLE BOTTLE ALONE RAKITIN IF ALYOSHA HAS SOME I WILL WHAT TOUCHING SENTIMENTALITY SAID RAKITIN TAUNTINGLY
AND CAME BACK HERE AGAIN UGH I WAS AFRAID I RAN FOR FEAR OF MEETING HIM AND WHY ARE YOU SO DRESSED UP WHAT A CURIOUS CAP YOU'VE GOT ON HOW CURIOUS YOU ARE YOURSELF RAKITIN
IT'S TRUE ALYOSHA I HAD SLY DESIGNS ON YOU BEFORE FOR I AM A HORRID VIOLENT CREATURE BUT AT OTHER TIMES I'VE LOOKED UPON YOU ALYOSHA AS MY CONSCIENCE I'VE KEPT THINKING
I KNOW IT BY HEART FOR I AM THAT WICKED WOMAN MYSELF I BOASTED TO RAKITIN THAT I HAD GIVEN AWAY AN ONION BUT TO YOU I'LL SAY
HASTENS JOYFULLY TO MEET HIM AND SHE WON'T TAKE A KNIFE WITH HER SHE WON'T NO I AM NOT LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE MISHA BUT I AM NOT LIKE THAT IT'S A LESSON TO ME SHE IS MORE LOVING THAN WE

WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I SOMETIMES LOOK AT YOU AND FEEL ASHAMED UTTERLY ASHAMED OF MYSELF AND HOW AND SINCE WHEN I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT YOU LIKE THAT I CAN'T SAY I DON'T REMEMBER
HAVE YOU TURNED THE MAGDALENE INTO THE TRUE PATH DRIVEN OUT THE SEVEN DEVILS EH SO YOU SEE THE MIRACLES YOU WERE LOOKING OUT FOR JUST NOW HAVE COME TO PASS HUSH RAKITIN ALYOSHA ANSWERED WITH AN ACHING HEART
AND WE MUST DRAW THE CURTAINS THAT'S BETTER SHE DREW THE HEAVY CURTAINS HERSELF HE'D RUSH IN AT ONCE IF HE SAW A LIGHT I AM AFRAID OF YOUR BROTHER MITYA TO DAY ALYOSHA
GOOD BY ALYOSHA MY FATE IS SEALED GO GO LEAVE ME ALL OF YOU DON'T LET ME SEE YOU AGAIN GRUSHENKA IS FLYING TO A NEW LIFE DON'T YOU REMEMBER EVIL AGAINST ME EITHER RAKITIN I MAY BE GOING TO MY DEATH UGH
THAT WILL COME IN VERY HANDY FOOLS ARE MADE FOR WISE MEN'S PROFIT AND NOW HOLD YOUR TONGUE RAKITIN WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY NOW IS NOT FOR YOUR EARS SIT DOWN IN THAT CORNER AND KEEP QUIET YOU DON'T LIKE US SO HOLD YOUR TONGUE
AND WHAT IS THIS MESSAGE MAY I ASK OR IS IT A SECRET RAKITIN PUT IN INQUISITIVELY DOING HIS BEST TO PRETEND NOT TO NOTICE THE SNUBS THAT WERE BEING CONTINUALLY AIMED AT HIM
BUT RAKITIN LOOKED AT HIM IRONICALLY AND ALYOSHA STOPPED SHORT
ONE DOESN'T OFTEN STUMBLE UPON CHAMPAGNE HE SAID LICKING HIS LIPS NOW ALYOSHA TAKE A GLASS SHOW WHAT YOU CAN DO WHAT SHALL WE DRINK TO THE GATES OF PARADISE TAKE A GLASS GRUSHENKA YOU DRINK TO THE GATES OF PARADISE TOO
DECIDING MY WHOLE FUTURE LIFE AND YOU CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT WAS IN MY HEART YES ALYOSHA TELL YOUR YOUNG LADY NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR WHAT HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY NOBODY IN THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS WHAT I AM GOING THROUGH NOW
LITTLE WAS KNOWN OF THE GIRL'S HISTORY IN THE TOWN AND THAT LITTLE WAS VAGUE NOTHING MORE HAD BEEN LEARNT DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS EVEN AFTER MANY PERSONS HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN INTO WHOM AGRAFENA ALEXANDROVNA HAD MEANWHILE DEVELOPED
I'LL PAY HIM OUT I'LL PAY HIM OUT DO YOU HEAR WELL THEN NOW YOU UNDERSTAND ME A MONTH AGO A LETTER CAME TO ME HE WAS COMING HE WAS A WIDOWER HE WANTED TO SEE ME IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY THEN I SUDDENLY THOUGHT IF HE COMES AND WHISTLES TO CALL ME I SHALL CREEP BACK TO HIM
FROM THE HALL THEY COULD HEAR GRUSHENKA LEAP UP FROM THE SOFA AND CRY OUT IN A FRIGHTENED VOICE WHO'S THERE BUT THE MAID MET THE VISITORS AND AT ONCE CALLED BACK TO HER MISTRESS IT'S NOT HE IT'S NOTHING ONLY OTHER VISITORS WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER
GRUSHENKA SAID IN A VOICE SUDDENLY ANXIOUS TURNING HER HEAD TOWARDS RAKITIN AND DRAWING A LITTLE AWAY FROM ALYOSHA THOUGH SHE STILL SAT ON HIS KNEE WITH HER ARM ROUND HIS NECK MY OFFICER IS COMING RAKITIN MY OFFICER IS COMING I HEARD HE WAS COMING
I REALLY CAN'T TAKE IT IN EVEN NOW EH RAKITIN IF ONLY YOU HAD BROUGHT HIM YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE
SUCH A VISITOR ALYOSHA MY DEAR BOY I GAZE AT YOU AND CAN'T BELIEVE MY EYES GOOD HEAVENS CAN YOU HAVE COME HERE TO SEE ME TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I NEVER HAD A THOUGHT OF SEEING YOU AND I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU WOULD EVER COME AND SEE ME
AND HE WON'T EITHER PERHAPS WON'T HE
SO HER GUARDIAN ANGEL STOOD AND WONDERED WHAT GOOD DEED OF HERS HE COULD REMEMBER TO TELL TO GOD SHE ONCE PULLED UP AN ONION IN HER GARDEN SAID HE AND GAVE IT TO A BEGGAR WOMAN AND GOD ANSWERED
OF HIS FORMER TERROR THAT WAS WHAT INSTINCTIVELY SURPRISED HIM YOU'VE TALKED NONSENSE ENOUGH CRIED RAKITIN YOU'D MUCH BETTER GIVE US SOME CHAMPAGNE YOU OWE IT ME YOU KNOW YOU DO YES I REALLY DO
GRUSHENKA WAS NOT EASILY TO BE APPROACHED AND EXCEPT HER AGED PROTECTOR THERE HAD NOT BEEN ONE MAN WHO COULD BOAST OF HER FAVORS DURING THOSE FOUR YEARS IT WAS A POSITIVE FACT FOR THERE HAD BEEN A GOOD MANY ESPECIALLY DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS
HE IS A POLE THAT OFFICER OF HERS HE BEGAN AGAIN RESTRAINING HIMSELF AND INDEED HE IS NOT AN OFFICER AT ALL NOW HE SERVED IN THE CUSTOMS IN SIBERIA SOMEWHERE ON THE CHINESE FRONTIER SOME
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU ANSWERED ALYOSHA BENDING OVER HER WITH A TENDER SMILE AND GENTLY TAKING HER BY THE HANDS I ONLY GAVE YOU AN ONION NOTHING BUT A TINY LITTLE ONION THAT WAS ALL
EVERYTHING WAS SIMPLE AND GOOD NATURED HER GESTURES WERE RAPID DIRECT CONFIDING BUT SHE WAS GREATLY EXCITED DEAR ME HOW EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER TO DAY SHE CHATTERED ON AGAIN
IF ONLY HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT CLEARLY AT THAT MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT HE HAD NOW THE STRONGEST ARMOR TO PROTECT HIM FROM EVERY LUST AND TEMPTATION YET IN SPITE OF THE VAGUE IRRESPONSIVENESS OF HIS SPIRITUAL CONDITION AND THE SORROW THAT OVERWHELMED HIM
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT NOBODY HERE DARES TALK OR THINK OF COMING TO AGRAFENA ALEXANDROVNA WITH ANY EVIL PURPOSE OLD KUZMA IS THE ONLY MAN I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HERE I WAS BOUND AND SOLD TO HIM SATAN BROUGHT US TOGETHER BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO ONE ELSE
SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE HIM AS THOUGH IN A SUDDEN FRENZY I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL MY LIFE FOR SOME ONE LIKE YOU I KNEW THAT SOME ONE LIKE YOU WOULD COME AND FORGIVE ME I BELIEVED THAT NASTY AS I AM SOME ONE WOULD REALLY LOVE ME NOT ONLY WITH A SHAMEFUL LOVE
IF YOU PASSED ME YOU DROPPED YOUR EYES AND I'VE LOOKED AT YOU A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE TO DAY I BEGAN ASKING EVERY ONE ABOUT YOU YOUR FACE HAUNTED MY HEART HE DESPISES ME I THOUGHT HE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME
THEY'RE BOTH GETTING SO FEEBLE THEY'LL BEGIN CRYING IN A MINUTE I SHALL BEGIN TO CRY I SHALL REPEATED GRUSHENKA HE CALLED ME HIS SISTER AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT ONLY LET ME TELL YOU RAKITIN THOUGH I AM BAD I DID GIVE AWAY AN ONION
I TELL YOU I AM EXPECTING NEWS PRICELESS NEWS SO I DON'T WANT MITYA AT ALL AND HE DIDN'T BELIEVE I FEEL HE DIDN'T THAT I SHOULD STAY AT KUZMA KUZMITCH'S
WHO HAD ATTEMPTED TO OBTAIN THOSE FAVORS BUT ALL THEIR EFFORTS HAD BEEN IN VAIN AND SOME OF THESE SUITORS HAD BEEN FORCED TO BEAT AN UNDIGNIFIED AND EVEN COMIC RETREAT
ONE LOVES PEOPLE FOR SOME REASON BUT WHAT HAVE EITHER OF YOU DONE FOR ME YOU SHOULD LOVE PEOPLE WITHOUT A REASON AS ALYOSHA DOES HOW DOES HE LOVE YOU
AS SOON AS SHE SAID THAT THE ONION BROKE AND THE WOMAN FELL INTO THE LAKE AND SHE IS BURNING THERE TO THIS DAY SO THE ANGEL WEPT AND WENT AWAY SO THAT'S THE STORY ALYOSHA
AN ONION GRUSHENKA LIVED IN THE BUSIEST PART OF THE TOWN NEAR THE CATHEDRAL SQUARE IN A SMALL WOODEN LODGE IN THE COURTYARD BELONGING TO THE HOUSE OF THE WIDOW MOROZOV THE HOUSE WAS A LARGE STONE BUILDING OF TWO STORIES OLD AND VERY UGLY
YOU MUSTN'T ASK TOO MUCH OF HUMAN ENDURANCE ONE MUST BE MERCIFUL ALYOSHA SAID THIS AT THE INSTINCTIVE PROMPTING OF HIS HEART HE FELT OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND HE TURNED TO RAKITIN IF RAKITIN HAD NOT BEEN THERE
CRAWL BACK LITTLE DOG BUT ONLY FOR ONE INSTANT SHE STOOD AS THOUGH HESITATING SUDDENLY THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HER HEAD AND SENT A GLOW TO HER CHEEKS I WILL GO SHE CRIED FIVE YEARS OF MY LIFE GOOD BY
I'VE LOST A TREASURE SUCH AS YOU HAVE NEVER HAD AND YOU CANNOT JUDGE ME NOW YOU HAD MUCH BETTER LOOK AT HER DO YOU SEE HOW SHE HAS PITY ON ME I CAME HERE TO FIND A WICKED SOUL I FELT DRAWN TO EVIL BECAUSE I WAS BASE AND EVIL MYSELF
I CAME HERE SEEKING MY RUIN
SHE HAD A GOOD HEAD FOR BUSINESS WAS ACQUISITIVE SAVING AND CAREFUL AND BY FAIR MEANS OR FOUL HAD SUCCEEDED IT WAS SAID IN AMASSING A LITTLE FORTUNE THERE WAS ONLY ONE POINT ON WHICH ALL WERE AGREED
WHAT FEROCITY ALYOSHA MADE NO REPLY HE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE HEARD HE WALKED FAST BESIDE RAKITIN AS THOUGH IN A TERRIBLE HURRY HE WAS LOST IN THOUGHT AND MOVED MECHANICALLY
IF I CHOOSE I'LL SEND KUZMA BACK ALL HE HAS EVER GIVEN ME TO MORROW AND ALL HIS MONEY AND I'LL GO OUT CHARING FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
HE COULD NOT HELP WONDERING AT A NEW AND STRANGE SENSATION IN HIS HEART THIS WOMAN THIS DREADFUL WOMAN HAD NO TERROR FOR HIM NOW NONE OF THAT TERROR THAT HAD STIRRED IN HIS SOUL AT ANY PASSING THOUGHT OF WOMAN ON THE CONTRARY
LOOK ALYOSHA HE'S SITTING THERE OPPOSITE US SO OFFENDED THAT I DIDN'T ASK HIM TO SIT DOWN BEFORE YOU UGH RAKITIN IS SUCH A ONE TO TAKE OFFENSE LAUGHED GRUSHENKA DON'T BE ANGRY RAKITIN I'M KIND TO DAY
I FEEL AS THOUGH I WERE DRUNK SHE SUDDENLY LEFT THEM AND RAN INTO HER BEDROOM WELL SHE HAS NO THOUGHTS FOR US NOW GRUMBLED RAKITIN
AND NOW AFTER FOUR YEARS THE SENSITIVE INJURED AND PATHETIC LITTLE ORPHAN HAD BECOME A PLUMP ROSY BEAUTY OF THE RUSSIAN TYPE A WOMAN OF BOLD AND DETERMINED CHARACTER PROUD AND INSOLENT
THE SPEAKER WAS NEITHER GRACE NOR FITZPIERS BUT MARTY SOUTH WHO APPROACHED WITH HER FACE TURNED UP TO THE SKY IN HER ENDEAVOR TO TRACE THE BIRDS SUDDENLY PERCEIVING GRACE SHE EXCLAIMED OH MISS MELBURY
MEANWHILE IN THE WOOD THEY HAD COME FROM THE MEN HAD SAT ON SO LONG THAT THEY WERE INDISPOSED TO BEGIN WORK AGAIN THAT EVENING THEY WERE PAID BY THE TON AND THEIR TIME FOR LABOR WAS AS THEY CHOSE
TURNING THEIR HEADS THEY SAW MELBURY'S GIG APPROACHING THE WHEELS MUFFLED BY THE YIELDING MOSS
AS THE DOCTOR HAD HELPED HER OUT OF IT HE APPEARED TO THINK THAT HE HAD EXCELLENT REASONS FOR HELPING HER IN AND PERFORMED THE ATTENTION LINGERINGLY ENOUGH WHAT WERE YOU ALMOST IN TEARS ABOUT JUST NOW HE ASKED SOFTLY
AND MEET THE POST MAN AT THE END OF ONE OF THE GREEN RIDES THROUGH THE HAZEL COPSE IN THE STRAIGHT STRETCH OF WHICH HIS LADEN FIGURE COULD BE SEEN A LONG WAY OFF
OBVIOUSLY MUCH PLEASED AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE I WONDER NOW IF MY DAUGHTER KNOWS YOU ARE SO NIGH AT HAND I DON'T EXPECT SHE DO
THIS INCREASING COMPLICATION ADDED STILL MORE VALUE TO GRACE IN THE SURGEON'S EYES IT RENDERED HER ADORABLE BUT CANNOT YOU SAY HE PLEADED DISTRACTEDLY I'D RATHER NOT I THINK I MUST GO HOME AT ONCE OH YES SAID FITZPIERS
MELBURY TOLD ANCIENT TIMBER STORIES AS HE SAT
AND YET AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE IMPRACTICABILITY TO WHICH POOR WINTERBORNE'S SUIT HAD BEEN REDUCED WAS TOUCHING GRACE'S HEART TO A WARMER SENTIMENT ON HIS BEHALF THAN SHE HAD FELT FOR YEARS CONCERNING HIM
SHE DOESN'T SEE US WELL NEVER MIND LET HER BE GRACE WAS INDEED QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF FITZPIERS'S PROPINQUITY SHE WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING WHICH HAD LITTLE CONNECTION WITH THE SCENE BEFORE HER THINKING OF HER FRIEND LOST AS SOON AS FOUND MISSUS CHARMOND
BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME AND NOW GILES HAS TO SUFFER FOR IT POOR GILES MURMURED GRACE
THE FLOWERS OF LATE APRIL TOOK UP A POSITION UNSEEN AND LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD BEEN BLOOMING A LONG WHILE
THE SECRET OF QUIET HAPPINESS LAY IN LIMITING THE IDEAS AND ASPIRATIONS THESE MEN'S THOUGHTS WERE CONTERMINOUS WITH THE MARGIN OF THE HINTOCK WOODLANDS AND WHY SHOULD NOT HIS BE LIKEWISE LIMITED A SMALL PRACTICE AMONG THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM BEING THE BOUND OF HIS DESIRES
TILL VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE SURROUNDING CIRCLE OF FAMILIARS IS CHARGED WITH THE RESERVED ONE'S MOODS AND MEANINGS THIS WAS THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS BETWEEN WINTERBORNE AND HIS NEIGHBORS AFTER HIS STROKE OF ILL LUCK
AN OPERATION COMPARABLE TO THE LITTLE TOILET OF THE EXECUTIONER'S VICTIM AFTER THIS IT WAS BARKED IN ITS ERECT POSITION TO A POINT AS HIGH AS A MAN COULD REACH IF A FINE PRODUCT OF VEGETABLE NATURE COULD EVER BE SAID TO LOOK RIDICULOUS IT WAS THE CASE NOW
THROW YOURSELF UPON HER GENEROSITY
WHICH IS APT TO FILL REFLECTIVE HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE NOT UNDERTAKING MUCH THEMSELVES WITH A SUDDEN UNEASINESS AT THE CONTRAST HE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE A CURIOUS SOUND SOMETHING LIKE THE QUACK OF A DUCK WHICH
IN GETTING UP OR DOWN FROM THE GIG OR WHEN SITTING BY THE HUT FIRE SHE HAD DROPPED HER PURSE
OVER THE VALE THE AIR WAS BLUE AS SAPPHIRE SUCH A BLUE AS OUTSIDE THAT APPLE VALLEY WAS NEVER SEEN UNDER THE BLUE THE ORCHARDS WERE IN A BLAZE OF BLOOM SOME OF THE RICHLY FLOWERED TREES RUNNING ALMOST UP TO WHERE THEY DROVE ALONG
BUT TO SPEAK ANY FURTHER ON THE SUBJECT HE COULD NOT FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO DO NOW
GRACE GAVE A START AND A SCREAM THE PLACE HAD BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIM IN HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED TO FIND HIM THERE STILL FITZPIERS LOST NOT A MOMENT IN RISING AND GOING TO HER SIDE I FRIGHTENED YOU DREADFULLY I KNOW HE SAID
AS NO WIND WAS STIRRING HE KNEW THAT IT COULD NOT BE THE ROSE TREE HE TOOK UP THE CANDLE AND WENT OUT NOBODY WAS NEAR AS HE TURNED THE LIGHT FLICKERED ON THE WHITEWASHED ROUGH CASE OF THE FRONT AND HE SAW WORDS WRITTEN THEREON IN CHARCOAL
FITZPIERS BESTOWED A REGULATION THOUGHT ON THE ADVANTAGEOUS MARRIAGE HE WAS BOUND TO MAKE WITH A WOMAN OF FAMILY AS GOOD AS HIS OWN AND OF PURSE MUCH LONGER BUT AS AN OBJECT OF CONTEMPLATION FOR THE PRESENT AS OBJECTIVE SPIRIT RATHER THAN CORPOREAL PRESENCE
AS THE MUFFLED DRUM TO HIS WORLDLY MARCH
MARTY WHO POURED OUT TEA WAS JUST SAYING
THEY PLACED THE LAST GATHERINGS OF BARK IN ROWS FOR THE CURERS WHICH LED THEM FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE SHED AND THUS THEY GRADUALLY WITHDREW AS THE SUN WENT DOWN FITZPIERS LINGERED YET HE HAD OPENED HIS BOOK AGAIN THOUGH HE COULD HARDLY SEE A WORD IN IT
WILL YOU COME ALONG AND WITHOUT LINGERING LONGER SHE TOOK HOLD OF MARTY'S ARM AND LED HER AWAY THEY WENT BETWEEN THE SPECTRAL ARMS OF THE PEELED TREES AS THEY LAY AND ONWARD AMONG THE GROWING TREES BY A PATH WHERE THERE WERE NO OAKS AND NO BARKING AND NO FITZPIERS
ON THE TWELFTH DAY THE MAN OF MISSIVES WHILE YET IN THE EXTREME DISTANCE HELD UP HIS HAND AND WINTERBORNE SAW A LETTER IN IT HE TOOK IT INTO THE SPAR HOUSE BEFORE HE BROKE THE SEAL
HE SAW MARTY STANDING IN HER DOOR WAY
AND COMPELLED TO RETREAT TO A SWAMP IN THIS VERY WOOD WHENCE THEY WERE RETURNING TO THEIR OLD QUARTERS AT THE RATE OF A COCK'S STRIDE EVERY NEW YEAR'S DAY OLD STYLE HENCE THE LOCAL SAYING ON NEW YEAR'S TIDE A COCK'S STRIDE
OF WHITE WITCHES AND BLACK WITCHES AND THE STANDARD STORY OF THE SPIRITS OF THE TWO BROTHERS WHO HAD FOUGHT AND FALLEN
ITS BEAMS STREAMED ACROSS THE STILL PROFILE OF SOUTH SUBLIMED BY THE AUGUST PRESENCE OF DEATH AND ONWARD A FEW FEET FARTHER UPON THE FACE OF HIS DAUGHTER
O GILES YOU'VE LOST YOUR DWELLING PLACE AND THEREFORE GILES YOU'LL LOSE YOUR GRACE GILES WENT IN DOORS HE HAD HIS SUSPICIONS AS TO THE SCRAWLER OF THOSE LINES BUT HE COULD NOT BE SURE
IN LIKE MANNER DO WE USE OUR EYES ON OUR TACITURN COMRADE THE INFINITESIMAL MOVEMENT OF MUSCLE CURVE HAIR AND WRINKLE WHICH WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY A VOICE GOES UNREGARDED IS WATCHED AND TRANSLATED IN THE LACK OF IT
THE SURGEON WAS QUITE SHROUDED FROM OBSERVATION BY THE RECESSED SHADOW OF THE HUT AND THERE WAS NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD MOVE TILL THE STRANGER HAD PASSED BY THE SHAPE RESOLVED ITSELF INTO A WOMAN'S SHE WAS LOOKING ON THE GROUND AND WALKING SLOWLY
BUT AS HE DID NOT MOVE SHE FELT IT AWKWARD TO WALK STRAIGHT AWAY FROM HIM AND SO THEY STOOD SILENTLY TOGETHER A DIVERSION WAS CREATED BY THE ACCIDENT OF TWO BIRDS THAT HAD EITHER BEEN ROOSTING ABOVE THEIR HEADS OR NESTING THERE TUMBLING ONE OVER THE OTHER INTO THE HOT ASHES AT THEIR FEET
SPRING WEATHER CAME ON RATHER SUDDENLY THE UNSEALING OF BUDS THAT HAD LONG BEEN SWOLLEN ACCOMPLISHING ITSELF IN THE SPACE OF ONE WARM NIGHT THE RUSH OF SAP IN THE VEINS OF THE TREES COULD ALMOST BE HEARD
INDEED SUCH PRACTICE AS HE HAD HE DID NOT FOLLOW UP WITH THE ASSIDUITY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY FOR DEVELOPING IT TO EXCEPTIONAL PROPORTIONS ONE DAY BOOK IN HAND HE WALKED IN A PART OF THE WOOD WHERE THE TREES WERE MAINLY OAKS
TO WHICH GRACE HERSELF HAD HOPED TO BE INTRODUCED BY HER FRIEND'S MEANS SHE WONDERED IF THIS PATRONIZING LADY WOULD RETURN TO HINTOCK DURING THE SUMMER AND WHETHER THE ACQUAINTANCE WHICH HAD BEEN NIPPED ON THE LAST OCCASION OF HER RESIDENCE THERE WOULD DEVELOP ON THE NEXT
MELBURY FEELING THAT HE HAD DONE SO GOOD AN ACTION IN COMING AS ALMOST TO EXTENUATE HIS PREVIOUS ARBITRARY CONDUCT TO NOTHING WENT HOME AND GILES WAS LEFT ALONE TO THE SUSPENSE OF WAITING FOR A REPLY FROM THE DIVINITY WHO SHAPED THE ENDS OF THE HINTOCK POPULATION
AS COMPARED WITH HER YOUTHFUL TIME GRACE WAS NOT AN AMBITIOUS GIRL AND MIGHT IF LEFT TO HERSELF HAVE DECLINED WINTERBORNE WITHOUT MUCH DISCONTENT OR UNHAPPINESS HER FEELINGS JUST NOW WERE SO FAR FROM LATENT THAT THE WRITING ON THE WALL HAD THUS QUICKENED HER TO AN UNUSUAL RASHNESS
THE TRUE ASPECT OF A MISTRESS IN HER LOVER'S REGARD MISS MELBURY HE SAID SUDDENLY I DIVINE THAT THIS VIRTUOUS MAN YOU MENTION HAS BEEN REFUSED BY YOU SHE COULD DO NO OTHERWISE THAN ADMIT IT
I SHALL NOT FORGET HIM NOW TO KEEP HER UP TO HER OWN TRUE LEVEL IT HAPPENED THAT GRACE WENT OUT FOR AN EARLY RAMBLE THAT MORNING PASSING THROUGH THE DOOR AND GATE WHILE HER FATHER WAS IN THE SPAR HOUSE TO GO IN HER CUSTOMARY DIRECTION SHE COULD NOT AVOID PASSING WINTERBORNE'S HOUSE
WHO KEPT HER SEAT WHERE AND HOW TO DUCK HER HEAD SO AS TO AVOID THE OVERHANGING BRANCHES THEY STOPPED AT THE SPOT WHERE THE BARK RIPPING HAD BEEN TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED
THE LETTER WAS NOT FROM MISSUS CHARMOND HERSELF BUT HER AGENT AT SHERTON WINTERBORNE GLANCED IT OVER AND LOOKED UP
BIRDS BEGAN NOT TO MIND GETTING WET IN DOOR PEOPLE SAID THEY HAD HEARD THE NIGHTINGALE TO WHICH OUT DOOR PEOPLE REPLIED CONTEMPTUOUSLY THAT THEY HAD HEARD HIM A FORTNIGHT BEFORE THE YOUNG DOCTOR'S PRACTICE BEING SCARCELY SO LARGE AS A LONDON SURGEON'S HE FREQUENTLY WALKED IN THE WOOD
OWING OBVIOUSLY TO A CONVICTION THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE LIVING THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PROFIT BY NEXT SEASON'S CROP HE LOOKED AT THE LEASES AGAIN AND THE LETTER ATTACHED
THESE REFLECTIONS DETAINED HIM TILL THE WOOD WAS EMBROWNED WITH THE COMING NIGHT
THE ADMIRER IS A SUPERFICIAL CONDITIONAL CREATURE AND THIS PERSON IS QUITE DIFFERENT HE HAS ALL THE CARDINAL VIRTUES PERHAPS THOUGH I DON'T KNOW THEM PRECISELY
ACCEPTED THEIR SHOUTED INVITATION TO HAVE A DISH OF TEA FOR WHICH PURPOSE HE HITCHED THE HORSE TO A BOUGH GRACE DECLINED TO TAKE ANY OF THEIR BEVERAGE AND REMAINED IN HER PLACE IN THE VEHICLE
AS I DON'T CARE TO SELL HER I SHOULD LIKE
WHEN IT WAS READY THE MEN WERE CALLED AND FITZPIERS BEING IN A MOOD TO JOIN SAT DOWN WITH THEM THE LATENT REASON OF HIS LINGERING HERE SO LONG REVEALED ITSELF WHEN THE FAINT CREAKING OF THE JOINTS OF A VEHICLE BECAME AUDIBLE AND ONE OF THE MEN SAID HERE'S HE
HE MEANWHILE WAS SITTING DOWN ALONE IN THE OLD FAMILIAR HOUSE WHICH HAD CEASED TO BE HIS TAKING A CALM IF SOMEWHAT DISMAL SURVEY OF AFFAIRS THE PENDULUM OF THE CLOCK BUMPED EVERY NOW AND THEN AGAINST ONE SIDE OF THE CASE IN WHICH IT SWUNG
ONE HABIT OF FITZPIERS'S COMMONER IN DREAMERS OF MORE ADVANCED AGE THAN IN MEN OF HIS YEARS WAS THAT OF TALKING TO HIMSELF HE PACED ROUND HIS ROOM WITH A SELECTIVE TREAD UPON THE MORE PROMINENT BLOOMS OF THE CARPET AND MURMURED
WINTERBORNE WELCOMED HIM BY A WORD AND A LOOK AND WENT ON WITH HIS EXAMINATION OF THE PARCHMENTS HIS VISITOR SAT DOWN
AND HERE'S MISTER WINTERBORNE SHE CONTINUED SHYLY AS SHE LOOKED TOWARDS FITZPIERS WHO STOOD IN THE BACKGROUND MARTY
SHE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW THE ILLUMINED FACE OF FITZPIERS
THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD LOST HIS HOUSES BY AN ACCIDENT WHICH MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN CIRCUMVENTED IF HE HAD KNOWN THE TRUE CONDITIONS OF HIS HOLDING THE TIME FOR PERFORMANCE HAD NOW LAPSED IN STRICT LAW BUT MIGHT NOT THE INTENTION BE CONSIDERED BY THE LANDHOLDER WHEN SHE BECAME AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
MELBURY HIMSELF WAS THE FIRST TO RISE THE NEXT MORNING AND WHEN HE HAD READ THE LETTER HIS RELIEF WAS GREAT
THUS SHE APPROACHED THE HEAP OF ASHES AND ACTING UPON WHAT WAS SUGGESTED BY A STILL SHINING EMBER OR TWO SHE TOOK A STICK AND STIRRED THE HEAP WHICH THEREUPON BURST INTO A FLAME ON LOOKING AROUND BY THE LIGHT THUS OBTAINED
NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE FACTORS OF HIS LIFE HAD WORKED OUT A SORRY PRODUCT FOR THOUSANDS HE SAW NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS REGULAR IN HIS DISCOVERY AT HINTOCK OF AN ALTOGETHER EXCEPTIONAL BEING OF THE OTHER SEX WHO FOR NOBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE HAD ANY EXISTENCE
THIS PHENOMENAL GIRL WILL BE THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE WHILE I AM AT HINTOCK AND THE SPECIAL BEAUTY OF THE SITUATION IS THAT OUR ATTITUDE AND RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER WILL BE PURELY SPIRITUAL
GRACE MELBURY WOULD SERVE TO KEEP HIS SOUL ALIVE AND TO RELIEVE THE MONOTONY OF HIS DAYS HIS FIRST NOTION ACQUIRED FROM THE MERE SIGHT OF HER WITHOUT CONVERSE THAT OF AN IDLE AND VULGAR FLIRTATION WITH A TIMBER MERCHANT'S PRETTY DAUGHTER
WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS AN IMPOSSIBILITY AND JUSTIFIES ANY AMOUNT OF ALARM
BUT YOU MUST SAID MELBURY IN SHORT
HE WAS ACTUALLY SUPPORTING HER WITH HIS ARM AS THOUGH UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS QUITE OVERCOME AND IN DANGER OF FALLING AS SOON AS SHE COULD COLLECT HER IDEAS SHE GENTLY WITHDREW FROM HIS GRASP AND EXPLAINED WHAT SHE HAD RETURNED FOR
AND BE D D TO HER CREEDLE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A FACE OF SEVEN SORROWS SAYING AH TWAS THAT SPERRIT THAT LOST EM FOR YE MAISTER WINTERBORNE SUBDUED HIS FEELINGS AND FROM THAT HOUR WHATEVER THEY WERE KEPT THEM ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF
AND THE WORDS WERE STRICTLY TRUE MELBURY MOUNTED ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THEY DROVE ON OUT OF THE GROVE THEIR WHEELS SILENTLY CRUSHING DELICATE PATTERNED MOSSES HYACINTHS PRIMROSES LORDS AND LADIES AND OTHER STRANGE AND ORDINARY PLANTS AND CRACKING UP LITTLE STICKS THAT LAY ACROSS THE TRACK
HAD NOT MUCH PERSEVERANCE THOUGH
THEN SHE MADE THE BEST OF HER WAY HOME WITHOUT LOOKING BEHIND HER GILES COULD DRAW AN INFERENCE NOW IF HE CHOSE THERE COULD NOT BE THE LEAST DOUBT THAT GENTLE GRACE WAS WARMING TO MORE SYMPATHY WITH AND INTEREST IN GILES WINTERBORNE THAN EVER SHE HAD DONE WHILE HE WAS
ACCORDING TO SCHLEIERMACHER THEY ARE SELF CONTROL PERSEVERANCE WISDOM AND LOVE AND HIS IS THE BEST LIST THAT I KNOW I AM AFRAID POOR
PARTICULARLY AS SHE CONTEMPLATES PULLING THE HOUSES DOWN HE SAID QUIETLY ONLY THINK OF THAT SAID SEVERAL WINTERBORNE HAD TURNED AWAY AND SAID VEHEMENTLY TO HIMSELF THEN LET HER PULL EM DOWN
FITZPIERS TOO
THAT OF PRODUCING IN HER AN UNACCOUNTABLE TENDENCY TO TEARFULNESS MELBURY SOON PUT THE HORSE TO RIGHTS AND SEEING THAT GRACE WAS SAFE TURNED AGAIN TO THE WORK PEOPLE HIS DAUGHTER'S NERVOUS DISTRESS HAD PASSED OFF IN A FEW MOMENTS AND SHE SAID QUITE GAYLY TO FITZPIERS AS SHE WALKED WITH HIM TOWARDS THE GROUP
A FRIEND OF PUBLICANS AND SINNERS SURELY JESUS WOULD DO THIS THAT SHE WAS DOING DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS GIRL IS ASKED MADAM PAGE IN AN ANGRY WHISPER STEPPING NEAR VIRGINIA I KNOW VERY WELL
THAT BROUGHT POLLY TO OH PHRONSIE SHE CRIED AND STRAINED HER TO HER HEART WHILE THE BOYS CROWDED AROUND AND PLIED HER WITH SUDDEN QUESTIONS NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED VAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU
THE GIRLS IN THE CARRIAGE WERE SMITTEN INTO HELPLESS ASTONISHMENT THE SALOON KEEPER HAD COME TO THE DOOR OF THE SALOON AND WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING ON WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS HIPS AND THE RECTANGLE FROM ITS WINDOWS ITS SALOON STEPS ITS FILTHY SIDEWALK GUTTER AND ROADWAY PAUSED
THERE'S NO DANGER SAID VIRGINIA BRIEFLY IS IT TRUE THAT YOUR BROTHER ROLLIN HAS BEEN CONVERTED ASKED THE FIRST SPEAKER LOOKING AT VIRGINIA CURIOUSLY IT IMPRESSED HER DURING THE DRIVE TO THE RECTANGLE THAT ALL THREE OF HER FRIENDS WERE REGARDING HER WITH CLOSE ATTENTION
DECIDEDLY THEREFORE YOU WILL PLEASE NOT INVITE HIM OR OTHERS LIKE HIM TO HOT SUPPERS BECAUSE I SUGGESTED IT OH DEAR I'M AWFULLY TIRED SHE YAWNED
ASKED HER FATHER A LITTLE SHARPLY ABOUT DOCTOR BRUCE I SAY WHAT IF HE SHOULD PROPOSE TO OUR CHURCH WHAT MISTER MAXWELL PROPOSED TO HIS
WELL SHE'S A NICE CHILD HE SAID A VERY NICE CHILD AND STRAIGHTENING HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULLEST HEIGHT AND LOOKING SO VERY HANDSOME THAT HIS DAUGHTER COULD NOT CONCEAL HER ADMIRATION
THE DOOR SHUT WITH THE INCISIVE BANG PECULIAR TO WELL MADE CARRIAGES OF THIS SORT
AND HER MOTHER WAS JUST ON THE POINT ALTHOUGH IT ALMOST KILLED HER OF SENDING FOR POLLY AS IF WE SHOULD HAVE LET HER GO HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
YOU CAN ANSWER FOR THE CONSEQUENCES I DO NOT STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH A MISERABLE MADAM PAGE LOST HER SELF CONTROL VIRGINIA STOPPED HER BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK THE NEXT WORD GRANDMOTHER THIS HOUSE IS MINE
MADAM PAGE GLANCED FROM HER GRANDDAUGHTER TO LOREEN IN ASTONISHMENT
SO WITH A GREAT MANY CHUCKLINGS AND SHRUGGINGS WHEN NO ONE WAS BY HE HAD DEPARTED AFTER BREAKFAST ONE DAY SIMPLY SAYING HE SHOULDN'T BE BACK TO LUNCH POLLY SAT IN THE DRAWING ROOM NEAR THE EDGE OF THE TWILIGHT PRACTICING AWAY BRAVELY
WE OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL WE'RE RICH SUPPOSE CHRIST HAD GONE ON THAT PRINCIPLE REPLIED FELICIA WITH UNUSUAL PERSISTENCE DO YOU REMEMBER DOCTOR BRUCE'S SERMON ON THAT VERSE A FEW SUNDAYS AGO FOR YE KNOW THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
JUST AS I AM WITHOUT ONE PLEA AND AS THE CARRIAGE ROLLED PAST SHE LEERED AT IT RAISING HER FACE SO THAT VIRGINIA SAW IT VERY CLOSE TO HER OWN IT WAS THE FACE OF THE GIRL WHO HAD KNEELED SOBBING THAT NIGHT WITH VIRGINIA KNEELING BESIDE HER AND PRAYING FOR HER
AND WITH UNDISGUISED WONDER STARED AT THE TWO GIRLS OVER THE SCENE THE WARM SUN OF SPRING POURED ITS MELLOW LIGHT A FAINT BREATH OF MUSIC FROM THE BAND STAND IN THE PARK FLOATED INTO THE RECTANGLE THE CONCERT HAD BEGUN
TO MADAM PAGE SOCIETY REPRESENTED MORE THAN THE CHURCH OR ANY OTHER INSTITUTION IT WAS A POWER TO BE FEARED AND OBEYED THE LOSS OF ITS GOOD WILL WAS A LOSS MORE TO BE DREADED THAN ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LOSS OF WEALTH ITSELF SHE STOOD ERECT AND STERN
AND HANDED THEM TO A SMALL BOY WHO WAS STANDING SHIVERING ON THE EDGE OF THE SIDEWALK ALMOST UNDER THE HORSES FEET HE TOOK THEM WITH A LOOK OF ASTONISHMENT AND A THANK YE LADY AND INSTANTLY BURIED A VERY GRIMY FACE IN THE BUNCH OF PERFUME THE GIRL STEPPED INTO THE CARRIAGE
IT IS DOUBTFUL IF ANY OF THEM WOULD HAVE TAKEN A PERSON LIKE LOREEN IN HER PRESENT CONDITION BUT THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION WITH VIRGINIA JUST NOW WHAT WOULD JESUS DO WITH LOREEN THAT WAS WHAT VIRGINIA FACED
DO YOU WANT OUR HELP COULDN'T YOU NO NO EXCLAIMED VIRGINIA YOU CANNOT BE OF ANY HELP TO ME THE CARRIAGE MOVED ON AND VIRGINIA WAS ALONE WITH HER CHARGE SHE LOOKED UP AND AROUND MANY FACES IN THE CROWD WERE SYMPATHETIC
IF THEY ARE KIND AND GIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE POOR AND I AM SURE THAT HE HIMSELF IS PRETTY COMFORTABLY SETTLED HE NEVER GIVES UP HIS LUXURIES JUST BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE GO HUNGRY WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO IF HE DID I TELL YOU FELICIA
HE ADDED I'M AFRAID THOSE WOULDN'T QUITE ANSWER THE PURPOSE SAID HIS MAMMA SMILING ESPECIALLY THE LAST YET WE MUST THINK OF SOMETHING
THAT THOUGH HE WAS RICH YET FOR OUR SAKES HE BECAME POOR THAT YE THROUGH HIS POVERTY MIGHT BECOME RICH I REMEMBER IT WELL ENOUGH SAID ROSE WITH SOME PETULANCE
THE DEVIL IS WAITING FOR ME SEE HIM SHE EXCLAIMED HOARSELY SHE TURNED AND POINTED WITH A SHAKING FINGER AT THE SALOON KEEPER THE CROWD LAUGHED VIRGINIA STEPPED UP TO HER AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER LOREEN SHE SAID FIRMLY COME WITH ME
THAT THE RECTANGLE SHOWED A DELICACY IN ITS SAD SILENCE THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO THE BOULEVARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IT FLASHED ACROSS HER
SHE OUGHT NOT TO THROW AWAY HER VOICE IN THAT RAILROAD TOWN UPON ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T APPRECIATE HER MISTER STERLING LIGHTED A NEW CIGAR AND ROSE EXCLAIMED
WEREN'T YOU AWFULLY SURPRISED CRIED PERCY SAY POLLY AWFULLY
SHE ASKED IN A COLD SNEERING VOICE THAT HURT VIRGINIA MORE THAN ANYTHING SHE HAD YET FELT YES I SAID SO VIRGINIA'S FACE FLUSHED BUT SHE SEEMED TO RECALL A VERSE THAT MISTER GRAY HAD USED FOR ONE OF HIS RECENT SERMONS
OH AND THEN THE NEXT MINUTE SHE HAD HER ARMS AROUND PRINCE'S NECK TOO WHO WAS JUMPING ALL OVER HER AND TRYING AS HARD AS HE COULD TO EXPRESS HIS OVERWHELMING DELIGHT SHE'S THE CUNNINGEST LITTLE THING I EVER SAW
VIRGINIA WAS OBLIGED TO HOLD FAST TO HER ARM SEVERAL TIMES THE GIRL LURCHED HEAVILY AGAINST HER
MISSUS STERLING HAD HER MEALS SERVED IN HER ROOM MISTER STERLING WAS PREOCCUPIED HE ATE VERY LITTLE AND EXCUSED HIMSELF EARLY AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS SATURDAY NIGHT HE REMARKED AS HE WENT OUT THAT HE SHOULD BE DOWN TOWN ON SOME SPECIAL BUSINESS
WELL SAID VAN AND HE SHOWED SIGNS OF RELENTING A LITTLE AT THAT BUT PERCY IS PERFECTLY AWFUL MAMMA YOU DON'T KNOW AND HE FEELS SO SMART TOO HE SAID VINDICTIVELY
BUT LOREEN STAGGERING ALONG WITH A YOUNG LADY FROM THE SOCIETY CIRCLES UPTOWN SUPPORTING HER WAS ANOTHER THING THE RECTANGLE VIEWED IT WITH SOBERNESS AND MORE OR LESS WONDERING ADMIRATION
OH JAPPY WHAT'LL SHE SAY HUSH SAID ONE OF THE OTHER BOYS DO BE STILL DICK POLLY SAT UP VERY STRAIGHT AND WHISKED OFF THE TEARS QUICKLY UP CAME MISTER KING WITH AN ENORMOUS BUNDLE IN HIS ARMS
WAS A FACT ASTOUNDING ENOUGH TO THROW MORE OR LESS DIGNITY AND IMPORTANCE ABOUT LOREEN HERSELF THE EVENT OF LOREEN'S STUMBLING THROUGH THE GUTTER DEAD DRUNK ALWAYS MADE THE RECTANGLE LAUGH AND JEST
SAID MISSUS WHITNEY WHO HADN'T YET GOTTEN OVER HER EXTREME SURPRISE AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S COMPLETE SUBJECTION TO THE LITTLE PEPPERS HE WHOM ALL CHILDREN HAD BY INSTINCT ALWAYS APPROACHED SO CAREFULLY AND WHOM EVERY ONE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO CONCILIATE
WE WILL TAKE THE CAR HERE AT THE CORNER LOREEN STAGGERED TO HER FEET AND TO VIRGINIA'S SURPRISE MADE NO TROUBLE SHE HAD EXPECTED RESISTANCE OR A STUBBORN REFUSAL TO MOVE WHEN THEY REACHED THE CORNER AND TOOK THE CAR IT WAS NEARLY FULL OF PEOPLE GOING UPTOWN
WE NEVER WEEP OVER THE REAL THING ON THE ACTUAL STAGE OF LIFE WHAT ARE THE SHADOWS OF LONDON ON THE STAGE TO THE SHADOWS OF LONDON OR CHICAGO AS THEY REALLY EXIST
VIRGINIA EYED THE MISERABLE FIGURE OF THE GIRL WITH A FEELING THAT SHE WAS AFRAID WOULD GROW INTO DISGUST FINALLY A THOUGHT POSSESSED HER THAT SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE WHAT WAS TO HINDER HER FROM TAKING LOREEN HOME WITH HER WHY SHOULD NOT THIS HOMELESS WRETCHED CREATURE
POLLY DON'T LIKE US AT LAST SAID VAN ONE DAY IN DESPAIR THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
IT WAS AN ELEGANT MANSION OF GRAY STONE FURNISHED LIKE A PALACE EVERY CORNER OF IT WARM WITH THE LUXURY OF PAINTINGS SCULPTURE ART AND MODERN REFINEMENT THE OWNER OF IT ALL MISTER CHARLES R STERLING STOOD BEFORE AN OPEN GRATE FIRE SMOKING A CIGAR
THE ONLY PLACE EXCEPT IN FRONT OF THE GRAND PIANO WHERE POLLY APPROACHED A STATE OF COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS WAS IN THE GREENHOUSE HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS
VIRGINIA WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE STARE THAT GREETED HER AND HER COMPANION AS THEY ENTERED BUT HER THOUGHT WAS DIRECTED MORE AND MORE TO THE APPROACHING SCENE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER WHAT WOULD MADAM PAGE SAY LOREEN WAS NEARLY SOBER NOW BUT SHE WAS LAPSING INTO A STATE OF STUPOR
AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE HERE I'M I'M HERE POLLY BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK
WHICH HER FRIEND VIRGINIA PAGE IS PUTTING UP ARE COMPLETED
WHO MOANED AND SOBBED AND NOW CLUNG TO HER AS FIRMLY AS BEFORE SHE HAD REPULSED HER SO THE TWO MOVED ON THROUGH THE RECTANGLE TOWARD THE EVANGELIST'S LODGING PLACE THE SIGHT SEEMED TO IMPRESS THE RECTANGLE SERIOUSLY
SAID MISSUS WHITNEY ENTHUSIASTICALLY AFTERWARD ASIDE TO MISTER KING
MURMURED FELICIA THE SHADOWS OF CHICAGO THE SHADOWS OF LONDON THE PLAY
HAD NO PLACE THAT COULD BE CALLED HOME THE GIRL SUDDENLY WRENCHED HER ARM FROM VIRGINIA'S GRASP IN DOING SO SHE NEARLY THREW VIRGINIA DOWN YOU SHALL NOT TOUCH ME LEAVE ME LET ME GO TO HELL THAT'S WHERE I BELONG
WE CANNOT AFFORD FOR THE SAKE OF OUR REPUTATIONS TO SHELTER SUCH A PERSON GRANDMOTHER I DO NOT WISH TO DO ANYTHING THAT IS DISPLEASING TO YOU BUT I MUST KEEP LOREEN HERE TONIGHT AND LONGER IF IT SEEMS BEST THEN
WHAT PLEDGE MISTER STERLING ASKED THE QUESTION AND THEN ADDED HASTILY OH I KNOW YES
SHE WAS FAST LAPSING INTO A WRETCHED CONDITION
I SHALL NOT STAY HERE THEN SAID MADAM PAGE SHE TURNED SUDDENLY AND WALKED TO THE END OF THE HALL SHE THEN CAME BACK AND GOING UP TO VIRGINIA SAID WITH AN EMPHASIS THAT REVEALED HER INTENSIVE EXCITEMENT OF PASSION
ALEXANDER POWERS USED TO BE A FRIEND OF MINE WE LEARNED TELEGRAPHY IN THE SAME OFFICE
SHE KNEW THAT THE EVANGELIST BOARDED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE TENT A NUMBER OF VOICES GAVE THE DIRECTION COME LOREEN I WANT YOU TO GO WITH ME TO MISTER GRAY'S SHE SAID
THERE HAVE BEEN QUEER DOINGS IN RAYMOND DURING THE PAST YEAR
SHE SIMPLY SAW A SOUL THAT HAD TASTED OF THE JOY OF A BETTER LIFE
AT NIGHT WHEN NO ONE KNEW IT THE TEARS WOULD COME RACING OVER THE POOR FORLORN LITTLE FACE AND WOULD NOT BE SQUEEZED BACK IT GOT TO BE NOTICED FINALLY AND ONE AND ALL REDOUBLED THEIR EXERTIONS TO MAKE EVERYTHING TWICE AS PLEASANT AS EVER
THE HOLY SPIRIT HAD SOFTENED A GOOD DEAL OF THE RECTANGLE WHERE DOES SHE LIVE ASKED VIRGINIA NO ONE ANSWERED IT OCCURRED TO VIRGINIA AFTERWARD WHEN SHE HAD TIME TO THINK IT OVER
STOP CRIED VIRGINIA MOTIONING TO THE DRIVER WHO WAS LOOKING AROUND THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AND IN A MOMENT SHE WAS OUT AND HAD GONE UP TO THE GIRL AND TAKEN HER BY THE ARM LOREEN SHE SAID AND THAT WAS ALL THE GIRL LOOKED INTO HER FACE
THE CONCERT WAS STUPID AND THE VIOLINIST WAS SIMPLY A BORE I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD SIT SO STILL THROUGH IT ALL ROSE EXCLAIMED A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY I LIKED THE MUSIC ANSWERED FELICIA QUIETLY YOU LIKE ANYTHING
AS THEY NEARED THE DISTRICT THEY GREW MORE AND MORE NERVOUS THE SIGHTS AND SMELLS AND SOUNDS WHICH HAD BECOME FAMILIAR TO VIRGINIA STRUCK THE SENSES OF THESE REFINED DELICATE SOCIETY GIRLS AS SOMETHING HORRIBLE AS THEY ENTERED FARTHER INTO THE DISTRICT
IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT I SHALL HAVE TO GIVE UP SHE MOANED I CAN'T BEAR IT AND OVER WENT HER HEAD ON THE MUSIC RACK
SO YOU SEE I WAS JUST IN TIME IN THE VERY NICK OF TIME IN FACT SO HER MOTHER WAS WILLING ASKED HIS DAUGHTER CURIOUSLY OH SHE COULDN'T HELP IT
WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THERE'S NO DANGER OF IT SAID ROSE RISING SUDDENLY FROM THE COUCH AS THE TEA BELL RANG
THAT SHE WAS UNWILLING TO PAIN HER LOVER BY MAKING DISPLAY OF ALL SHE HAD UNDERGONE OH HE REFUSED TO REPLY SURELY THAT IS EXTREME BEHAVIOUR WHAT SHE DREADED SEEMED TO BE COMING TO PASS
EARS SMALL AND V SHAPED NICELY FEATHERED SET WIDE APART AND HIGH ON THE HEAD AND CARRIED SLIGHTLY FORWARD NECK
LONG WITH THICK UNDERCOAT STRAIGHT AND FLAT NOT CURLY NOR WAVY RATHER COARSE BUT SOFT FEATHER ON THIGHS
THE HON MISSUS MC LAREN MORRISON AN AUTHORITY ON EXOTIC DOGS WHOSE OPINION MUST ALWAYS BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT
THEY ALMOST INEVITABLY LEAVE A BLUISH MARK WHILE IN SOME CASES THE EYE ITSELF BECOMES CONTRACTED WHETHER THIS IS ONE OF THE RESULTS OF IN BREEDING IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY
IT SHOULD BE ABUNDANT PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE NECK WHERE IT FORMS A RUFFLE
THE LENGTH OF THE DOG SHOULD BE ABOUT ITS HEIGHT LEGS THE BONES OF THE LEGS SHOULD BE SMALL GIVING THEM A SLENDER APPEARANCE
OF FIVE DOGS TAKEN FROM THE SUMMER PALACE WHERE THEY HAD NO DOUBT BEEN FORGOTTEN ON THE FLIGHT OF THE COURT TO THE INTERIOR ADMIRAL LORD JOHN HAY
BLACK MASKS AND SPECTACLES ROUND THE EYES WITH LINES TO THE EARS ARE DESIRABLE LEGS SHORT FORE LEGS HEAVY
I THOUGHT YOU SEEMED A LITTLE DOUBTFUL HIS TONE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER THAT WHICH MAKES BANTER PLEASANT BETWEEN LOVERS MARIAN LOOKED AT HIM FEARFULLY

MISSUS YULE WOULD HAVE TENDED HER WITH UNREMITTING DEVOTION BUT THE GIRL DESIRED TO BE ALONE AT TIMES SHE LAY IN SILENT ANGUISH FREQUENTLY HER TEARS BROKE FORTH
ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE BITCHES FOR INSTANCE A PINKISH TINGE
SHE STOPPED AN EMPTY CAB THAT PRESENTLY PASSED HER AND SO DROVE TO THE MILVAINS LODGINGS
THE JAPANESE WHO HAVE TREASURED THEM FOR CENTURIES HAVE THE BELIEF THAT THEY ARE NOT LESS ANCIENT THAN THE DOGS OF MALTA THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBABILITY HOWEVER
SHE WENT TO HIS SIDE HER HEART ACHED BECAUSE IN HER GREAT MISERY HE HAD NOT FONDLED HER AND INTOXICATED HER SENSES WITH LOVING WORDS
JASPER STOOD RATHER STIFFLY AND THREW HIS HEAD BACK YOU KNOW THE REASON DEAR THAT PREJUDICE HAS ENTERED INTO HIS VERY LIFE IT IS NOT YOU HE DISLIKES THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE HE THINKS OF YOU

SHE ROSE WHEN THE SPARROWS BEGAN TO WALK OUT OF THE ROOF HOLES SAT ON THE FLOOR OF HER ROOM IN THE DIM LIGHT AND BY AND BY PEEPED OUT BEHIND THE WINDOW CURTAINS IT WAS EVEN NOW DAY OUT OF DOORS
AND WENT SOME WAY TO REMOVE HIS UNEASINESS AT THE PROSPECT OF ENDANGERING HIS PROFESSIONAL AND SOCIAL CHANCES BY AN ALLIANCE WITH THE FAMILY OF A SIMPLE COUNTRYMAN THE INTERIM CLOSED UP ITS PERSPECTIVE
NEVER WOULD SEE HER OR CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HER AT ALL THOUGH THEIR CREATION HAD SUCH INTERESTING RELATION TO HER LIFE THAT IT WOULD ENCLOSE HER VERY HEART AT A MOMENT WHEN THAT HEART WOULD BEAT IF NOT WITH MORE EMOTIONAL ARDOR
AND MANY THINGS OF WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROUD BUT IT HAD NEVER BEEN FATHOMED BY THE HONEST MINDS OF HINTOCK AND SHE RARELY VOLUNTEERED HER EXPERIENCES AS FOR HER CAPRICIOUS NATURE THE PEOPLE ON HER ESTATES GREW ACCUSTOMED TO IT
TO TROUBLESOME DUBIOUSNESS MATRIMONIAL AMBITION IS SUCH AN HONORABLE THING MY FATHER HAS TOLD ME THAT YOU HAVE SENT OFF ONE OF THE MEN WITH A LATE LETTER TO BUDMOUTH CRIED GRACE COMING OUT VIVACIOUSLY TO MEET HIM UNDER THE DECLINING LIGHT OF THE SKY
MY REFLECTIONS DOCTOR YOU MUST NOT COME HERE ANY MORE THEY BEGIN TO THINK IT A FARCE ALREADY I SAY YOU MUST COME NO MORE
WHEN ATTIRED SHE SEARCHED ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR HER FATHER SHE FOUND HIM AT LAST IN THE GARDEN STOOPING TO EXAMINE THE POTATOES FOR SIGNS OF DISEASE HEARING HER RUSTLE HE STOOD UP AND STRETCHED HIS BACK AND ARMS SAYING
HE DREW A TROUBLED BREATH AND WENT IN DOORS HERE HE RAPIDLY PENNED A LETTER
HE DREW BACK THE WINDOW CURTAINS WHEREUPON THE RED GLOW OF THE LAMP AND THE TWO CANDLE FLAMES BECAME ALMOST INVISIBLE WITH THE FLOOD OF LATE AUTUMN SUNLIGHT THAT POURED IN SHALL I COME ROUND TO YOU HE ASKED HER BACK BEING TOWARDS HIM NO
HER DREAMY EYES RESTING ON THE SWAYING TIP OF A DISTANT TREE
FITZPIERS CONTRADICTED THIS IDEA IN HIS MOST VIBRATORY TONES AND SHE LAPSED INTO THE FRIVOLOUS ARCHNESS UNDER WHICH SHE HID PASSIONS OF NO MEAN STRENGTH STRANGE SMOULDERING ERRATIC PASSIONS KEPT DOWN LIKE A STIFLED
HIS REMOTE GAZE AT HER HAD BEEN ONE OF MILD INTEREST RATHER THAN OF RAPTURE BUT SHE LOOKED SO LOVELY IN THE GREEN WORLD ABOUT HER HER PINK CHEEKS HER SIMPLE LIGHT DRESS
ONLY TO MIDDLETON ABBEY FOR A MONTH OR TWO YET PERHAPS I SHALL GAIN STRENGTH THERE PARTICULARLY STRENGTH OF MIND I REQUIRE IT AND WHEN I COME BACK I SHALL BE A NEW WOMAN AND YOU CAN COME AND SEE ME SAFELY THEN AND BRING YOUR WIFE WITH YOU
AFTER WHICH HIS DEPARTURE FROM HINTOCK WOULD BE IRREVOCABLE BUT COULD HE GO AWAY REMEMBERING WHAT HAD JUST PASSED THE TREES THE HILLS THE LEAVES THE GRASS
THE SHOCK GIVEN TO HER GIRLISH SENSIBILITIES BY HIS IRREVERENT VIEWS OF MARRIAGE TOGETHER WITH THE SURE AND NEAR APPROACH OF THE DAY FIXED FOR COMMITTING HER FUTURE TO HIS KEEPING MADE HER SO RESTLESS
AND THE DELICATE FLEXIBILITY OF HER MOVEMENT ACQUIRED SUCH RARITY FROM THEIR WILD WOOD SETTING THAT HIS EYES KINDLED AS HE DREW NEAR MY DARLING WHAT IS IT YOUR FATHER SAYS YOU ARE IN THE POUTS AND JEALOUS
TIM TANGS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN SHE ENTERED THE SHELTER OF THE TALL HEDGE AND ONLY THE TOP OF HER HEAD COULD BE SEEN HASTENING IN THE DIRECTION OF HER OWN DWELLING
IF I DRAGGED HER HEAD OFF DOWN SHE SAT AND OUT IT CAME A LOVELY MOLAR NOT A SPECK UPON IT AND OFF SHE WENT WITH IT IN HER HANDKERCHIEF
IT WAS ALL SO PLAUSIBLE SO COMPLETELY EXPLAINED KNOWING NOTHING OF THE INCIDENT IN THE WOOD ON OLD MIDSUMMER EVE GRACE FELT THAT HER SUSPICIONS WERE UNWORTHY AND ABSURD AND WITH THE READINESS OF AN HONEST HEART
BUT THERE WERE PREPARATIONS IMAGINABLE READILY ENOUGH BY THOSE WHO HAD SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE REMOTE AND FASHIONABLE TOWN OF SANDBOURNE SOMETHING WAS GROWING UP UNDER THE HANDS OF SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAD NEVER SEEN GRACE MELBURY
SHE SAID WITH HESITATION I'LL TELL YOU BY AND BY I MUST GO IN DOORS I HAVE HAD NO BREAKFAST BY A SORT OF DIVINATION HIS CONJECTURE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FACT NOR I SAID HE LIGHTLY
UNDER WHICH THE SCRAPE HAD TURNED THE COLOR OF AN UNRIPE BLACKBERRY PREVIOUS TO VANISHING ALTOGETHER WAIT A MOMENT THEN I'LL DAMP IT SAID FITZPIERS HE PUT HIS LIPS TO THE PLACE AND KEPT THEM THERE TILL THE PLASTER CAME OFF EASILY
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CARE BUT IT WAS NOT HEAVY FOR ITS SIZE MISSUS DOLLERY HERSELF CARRIED IT INTO THE HOUSE
THE WOMAN WENT QUICKLY DOWN THE BOX EDGED PATH BETWEEN THE RASPBERRIES AND CURRANTS AND AS SHE WALKED HER WELL DEVELOPED FORM AND GAIT BETRAYED HER INDIVIDUALITY
WITH AN AIR WHICH MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN CALLED PASSIONATE IT IS NO USE DENYING IT YOU HAVE BOUGHT A PRACTICE AT BUDMOUTH
HIS WIFE HERSELF SAW THE AWKWARDNESS OF THEIR POSITION HERE AND CHEERFULLY WELCOMED THE PURPOSED CHANGE TOWARDS WHICH EVERY STEP HAD BEEN TAKEN BUT THE LAST BUT COULD HE FIND IT IN HIS HEART AS HE FOUND IT CLEARLY ENOUGH IN HIS CONSCIENCE TO GO AWAY
PERFECTLY MADDENED WITH AN ACHING TOOTH AS NO BODY HEARD HER RING SHE THREW SOME GRAVEL AT MY WINDOW TILL AT LAST I HEARD HER AND SLIPPED ON MY DRESSING GOWN AND WENT DOWN THE POOR THING BEGGED ME WITH TEARS IN HER EYES TO TAKE OUT HER TORMENTOR
OH YES SAID FITZPIERS WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON GRACE WHOSE EYES WERE SHYLY BENT DOWNWARD NOW SAID HER FATHER TELL ME THE PAIR OF YE
DONE WE HAVE DONE NOTHING PERHAPS WE HAVE THOUGHT THE MORE HOWEVER IT IS ALL VEXATION I AM GOING AWAY TO MIDDLETON ABBEY NEAR SHOTTSFORD WHERE A RELATIVE OF MY LATE HUSBAND LIVES WHO IS CONFINED TO HER BED
AND SHAPING HER WILL INTO PASSIVE CONCURRENCE WITH ALL HIS DESIRES APART FROM HIS LOVER LIKE ANXIETY TO POSSESS HER THE FEW GOLDEN HUNDREDS OF THE TIMBER DEALER READY TO HAND FORMED A WARM BACKGROUND TO GRACE'S LOVELY FACE
WHY HAD HE CARRIED OUT THIS IMPULSE TAKEN SUCH WILD TROUBLE TO EFFECT A PROBABLE INJURY TO HIS OWN AND HIS YOUNG WIFE'S PROSPECTS HIS MOTIVE WAS FANTASTIC GLOWING SHAPELESS AS THE FIERY SCENERY ABOUT THE WESTERN SKY
CONFLAGRATION BUT BURSTING OUT NOW HERE NOW THERE THE ONLY CERTAIN ELEMENT IN THEIR DIRECTION BEING ITS UNEXPECTEDNESS
SORROW AND BITTERNESS IN THE SKY AND FLOODS OF AGONIZED TEARS BEATING AGAINST THE PANES I LAY AWAKE LAST NIGHT AND I COULD HEAR THE SCRAPE OF SNAILS CREEPING UP THE WINDOW GLASS IT WAS SO SAD
THOSE IN WHOM PARENTAL DISCOVERY OF THE VALUE OF EDUCATION HAS IMPLANTED TASTES WHICH PARENTAL CIRCLES FAIL TO GRATIFY BUT WHAT AN ATTENUATION WAS THIS COLD PRIDE OF THE DREAM OF HER YOUTH
PRAY GOD IT IS FOR THE BEST FROM THIS HOUR THERE WAS NO SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT RECALCITRATION ON HER PART FITZPIERS KEPT HIMSELF CONTINUALLY NEAR HER DOMINATING ANY REBELLIOUS IMPULSE
EACH HAD BEEN ENDOWED AND QUICKENED WITH A SUBTLE CHARM SINCE HE HAD DISCOVERED THE PERSON AND HISTORY AND ABOVE ALL MOOD OF THEIR OWNER THERE WAS EVERY TEMPORAL REASON FOR LEAVING IT
RESPONDING TO IT ENTIRELY BY CROOKING THEIR LIMBS WRINKLED LIKE AN OLD CRONE'S FACE AND ANTLERED WITH DEAD BRANCHES THAT ROSE ABOVE THE FOLIAGE OF THEIR SUMMITS
OF SOME INNERMOST CREEK OF AN EMBAYED SEA YET NO NEWS INTERFERED WITH THE NUPTIAL PURPOSE AT THEIR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE THE SAPPY GREEN TWIG TIPS OF THE SEASON'S GROWTH WOULD NOT SHE THOUGHT BE APPRECIABLY WOODIER
AND SO GOT THE LETTER OFF THE MAN RETURNED MET FITZPIERS IN THE LANE AND TOLD HIM THE THING WAS DONE FITZPIERS WENT BACK TO HIS HOUSE MUSING
IN THE EVENING WITH LISTLESS ADROITNESS SHE ENCOURAGED THE MAID WHO DRESSED HER FOR DINNER TO SPEAK OF DOCTOR FITZPIERS'S MARRIAGE MISSUS FITZPIERS WAS ONCE SUPPOSED TO FAVOR MISTER WINTERBORNE SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN
WHY SHOULD DEATH ONLY LEND WHAT LIFE IS COMPELLED TO BORROW REST ANSWER THAT DOCTOR FITZPIERS YOU MUST EAT OF A SECOND TREE OF KNOWLEDGE BEFORE YOU CAN DO IT FELICE CHARMOND THEN WHEN MY EMOTIONS HAVE EXHAUSTED THEMSELVES
MY HOT BLOOD INDEED FITZPIERS EXAMINED SO CLOSELY THAT HIS BREATH TOUCHED HER TENDERLY AT WHICH THEIR EYES ROSE TO AN ENCOUNTER HERS SHOWING THEMSELVES AS DEEP AND MYSTERIOUS AS INTERSTELLAR SPACE
BEEN PAID AND HAD RUMBLED AWAY HE ENTERED THE DWELLING
AND WE'LL BE FRIENDS SHE AND I OH HOW THIS SHUTTING UP OF ONE'S SELF DOES LEAD TO INDULGENCE IN IDLE SENTIMENTS I SHALL NOT WISH YOU TO GIVE YOUR ATTENDANCE TO ME AFTER TO DAY
IT WAS TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE HE VISITED MISSUS CHARMOND AGAIN THE MORNING HAD BEEN WINDY AND LITTLE SHOWERS HAD SOWED THEMSELVES LIKE GRAIN AGAINST THE WALLS AND WINDOW PANES OF THE HINTOCK COTTAGES
SO THAT IT MIGHT CATCH THE EYES OF THE SERVANTS AND MAKE HIS PRESENCE APPEAR DECIDEDLY NECESSARY IN CASE THERE SHOULD BE ANY DOUBT OF THE FACT OH YOU HURT ME SHE EXCLAIMED ONE DAY HE WAS PEELING OFF THE BIT OF PLASTER ON HER ARM
AS TONED BY THE SUNLIGHT AND LEAFAGE SHE HEARD A FOOT FALL CRUSHING DEAD LEAVES BEHIND HER AND FOUND HERSELF RECONNOITERED BY FITZPIERS HIMSELF APPROACHING GAY AND FRESH AS THE MORNING AROUND THEM
HER VOICE SANK ALMOST TO A WHISPER AS SHE ADDED WITH AN INCIPIENT POUT UPON HER FULL LIPS LET ME THINK AT LEAST THAT IF YOU HAD REALLY LOVED ME AT ALL SERIOUSLY YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED ME FOR EVER AND EVER YOU ARE RIGHT
LENDS TO SUCH SCENES OUTSIDE HER WINDOW HELPLESS IMMOBILITY SEEMED TO BE COMBINED WITH INTENSE CONSCIOUSNESS A MEDITATIVE INERTNESS POSSESSED ALL THINGS OPPRESSIVELY CONTRASTING WITH HER OWN ACTIVE EMOTIONS
SHE TURNED HER FACE AWAY SUDDENLY AH NONE OF THAT NONE OF THAT I CANNOT COQUET WITH YOU SHE CRIED DON'T SUPPOSE I CONSENT TO FOR ONE MOMENT OUR POOR BRIEF YOUTHFUL HOUR OF LOVE MAKING WAS TOO LONG AGO TO BEAR CONTINUING NOW
THE NARROW INTERVAL THAT STOOD BEFORE THE DAY DIMINISHED YET THERE WAS IN GRACE'S MIND SOMETIMES A CERTAIN ANTICIPATIVE SATISFACTION THE SATISFACTION OF FEELING THAT SHE WOULD BE THE HEROINE OF AN HOUR
SOMETHING BROKE THE STILLNESS THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE SHE WAS GAZING AT OPENED SOFTLY AND THERE CAME OUT INTO THE PORCH A FEMALE FIGURE WRAPPED IN A LARGE SHAWL BENEATH WHICH WAS VISIBLE
HER WHOLE BEING SEEMED TO DISSOLVE IN A SAD POWERLESSNESS TO DO ANYTHING AND THE SENSE OF IT MADE HER LIPS TREMULOUS
DOCTOR YOU ARE GOING AWAY SHE EXCLAIMED CONFRONTING HIM WITH ACCUSATORY REPROACH IN HER LARGE DARK EYES NO LESS THAN IN HER RICH COOING VOICE OH YES YOU ARE SHE WENT ON SPRINGING TO HER FEET
SO MUCH THE BETTER I HAD TO FIGHT THE BATTLE OF LIFE AS WELL AS YOU I MAY TELL YOU ABOUT IT SOME DAY BUT DON'T EVER ASK ME TO DO IT AND PARTICULARLY DO NOT PRESS ME TO TELL YOU NOW
I NATURALLY CANNOT FORGET THAT LITTLE SPACE IN WHICH I FLITTED ACROSS THE FIELD OF YOUR VISION IN THOSE DAYS OF THE PAST AND THE RECOLLECTION OPENS UP ALL SORTS OF IMAGININGS SUPPOSE MY MOTHER HAD NOT TAKEN ME AWAY SHE MURMURED
AND EDGING THROUGH A SLIT IN THE GARDEN FENCE WALKED AWAY INTO THE WOOD JUST ABOUT HERE THE TREES WERE LARGE AND WIDE APART AND THERE WAS NO UNDERGROWTH SO THAT SHE COULD BE SEEN TO SOME DISTANCE A SYLPH LIKE GREENISH WHITE CREATURE
WE KNOW BETTER JEALOUS OH NO
YET HE WELL DIVINED THE CONTENTS OF THAT BOX AND WAS IN TRUTH ALL THE WHILE IN A PLEASANT EXALTATION AT THE PROOF THAT THUS FAR AT ANY RATE NO DISAPPOINTMENT HAD SUPERVENED
HE LEFT HER AT THE DOOR OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE AS HE RECEDED AND WAS CLASPED OUT OF SIGHT BY THE FILMY SHADES HE IMPRESSED GRACE AS A MAN WHO HARDLY APPERTAINED TO HER EXISTENCE AT ALL
THE OUT BUILDINGS THE GARDEN EVERY OBJECT WORE THAT ASPECT OF MESMERIC FIXITY
IN REFUSING THAT POOR MAN HIS REASONABLE REQUEST SHE SAID TO HERSELF I FOREDOOMED MY REJUVENATED GIRLHOOD'S ROMANCE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SUCH A BUSINESS MATTER COULD HAVE NETTLED MY OWN HEART LIKE THIS
HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER IN A FLUTTER OF EXCITEMENT OVER THE WEDDING GOWN JUST ARRIVED FROM THE LEADING DRESS MAKER OF SANDBOURNE WATERING PLACE AFORESAID DURING THESE WEEKS GILES WINTERBORNE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN OR HEARD OF
LEANED OVER THEIR GARDEN GATES FOR A WHIFF OF EVENING AIR AND TO CATCH ANY LAST AND FARTHEST THROB OF NEWS FROM THE OUTER WORLD WHICH ENTERED AND EXPIRED AT LITTLE HINTOCK LIKE THE EXHAUSTED SWELL OF A WAVE IN SOME INNERMOST CAVERN
AND FITZPIERS WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE WINDOW CURTAINS WERE CLOSED AND A RED SHADED LAMP AND CANDLES BURNING
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM LOOK SO INCENSED BEFORE NOW HEARKEN TO ME HE SAID THERE'S A TIME FOR A WOMAN TO ALTER HER MIND AND THERE'S A TIME WHEN SHE CAN NO LONGER ALTER IT IF SHE HAS ANY RIGHT EYE TO HER PARENTS HONOR
FULLER WAVED HIS ARMS UP AND DOWN SLOWLY TO THE ENGINEER AS A SIGNAL TO COME TO A GRADUAL STOP THEY COASTED DOWN UPON THE BOX CAR PICKED IT UP AND CARRIED IT ON WITH THEM FULLER AND MURPHY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF IT MURPHY STAYING AT THE REAR END TO REPEAT THE SIGNALS OF FULLER
LOOSENED ONE TACK AND BENT THE CORNER UP THEN HE PUT HIS EAR DOWN AND LISTENED ALF HAD JUST RETURNED TO THE ROOM WHY NOT TAKE EM TO CHATTANOOGA NOW HE WAS DEMANDING TURN EM OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES NOW ALF SAID THE JUDGE

THROUGH EACH SETTLEMENT HE WALKED STAR QUIETLY BUT ALWAYS READY TO THROW HIMSELF FORWARD DIG HIS HEELS INTO THE HORSE'S FLANKS AND RACE AWAY AN HOUR PASSED TWO HOURS THREE HOURS THEY PRESSED NORTHWARD STEADILY SOMETIMES AT A WALK BUT USUALLY AT A COMFORTABLE STEADY TROT
PREPARED FOR A BATTLE THERE ARE BRIDGES AHEAD THE CHICKAMAUGA BRIDGES WE'LL DROP ANOTHER CAR ON THE RESECA BRIDGE GO BACK AND TELL THEM I'LL SLOW DOWN TRY TO WRECK IT IN THE SHED TOM HURRIED BACK AGAIN OVER THE WOOD PILE

PUT IT ON THE TOP RAIL AS A MARKER SHE SAID AS SHE TURNED BACK FOR THE RUN TOM SPREAD THE HANDKERCHIEF ON THE FENCE A TINY SPOT OF WHITE TO GUIDE STAR OVER THEN HE WATCHED HER AS SHE RETREATED INTO THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF THE WOODS HIS HEART THUMPING SO THAT IT HURT
THE WHEELS OF THE ABANDONED CAR KNOCKED SEVERAL OUT OF THE WAY THEN AS THE TRAIN SWUNG ABOUT THE CURVE LEAVING THE CAR HIDDEN IN THE SHED TOM SAW ONE TIE RESTING AT AN ANGLE ACROSS THE TRACK THE WHEELS STRUCK IT AND THE CAR LURCHED HEAVILY THEY COULD SEE NO MORE

IT HAD NEVER ENTERED HIS HEAD THAT THEIR LONG STRUGGLE AGAINST SO MANY OBSTACLES COULD END IN ANYTHING BUT GLORIOUS SUCCESS SURELY THEY COULD DO SOMETHING TO BLOCK THE WAY OF THE PURSUING ENGINE CAN'T WE STOP AND FIGHT HE ASKED
BUT EXPECTING TO FIND IT ABANDONED AROUND EACH CURVE HE RACED ON AND ON UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE HAND CAR THEN THE YONAH WHEN THE YONAH HAD RUN OUT OF FUEL THE NEW YORK WAS THERE TO CARRY HIM TO THE ROME ENGINE WHEN THE ROME ENGINE HAD BEEN STOPPED BY THE BREAK IN THE TRACK

THIS MAKES EVERYTHING VERY DIFFERENT HE DECLARED AND EVEN HIS VOICE WAS ALTERED THERE WAS A DETERMINED PURPOSEFUL RING ABOUT IT WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER UNLIKE HIS USUAL RECKLESS TONES THANKS FOR NOT TELLING MISTER POWART
THAT I HAD SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN GOOD NIGHT YOU AREN'T HIS VOICE WAS STRAINED AND EXCITED MONA YOU JUST NOW SAID SOMETHING OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY SURELY INCREDULOUSLY YOU RECALL SAYING SOMETHING DON'T YOU
THAT YOU HAVE PUT INTO CIRCULATION AGAINST HIM YOU KNOW ALSO THAT MY MOTHER HAS ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND THAT IT WILL GO NEAR TO BREAK HER HEART TO HAVE HIM DISMISSED FOR ANY ONE ELSE THIS IS THE MEANING OF WHAT I SAY
IT IS MY INTENTION TO SET A MARK EVEN FURTHER THAN YOUR OWN SIR FOR THE FIRST TIME POWART LAUGHED IT WAS A REALLY HEARTY LAUGH AS THOUGH FORT'S PREPOSTEROUS BOAST WAS SO UTTERLY RIDICULOUS THAT SARCASM WAS OUT OF PLACE
NOW THAT SHE WILL BE IN GOOD HANDS I SHALL FEEL THAT I HAVE DONE MY DUTY AND PRAY DOES ROWLAND KNOW OF YOUR HAVING BROUGHT THIS STRANGER HERE OF COURSE MISTER WALCOT IS OUR GUEST TILL HIS OWN HOUSE CAN BE PREPARED FOR HIM
DURING THE EATING OF WHICH THE TWO MEN BECAME PRETTY FRIENDLY YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF THE FOLKS OF YOUR STATION REBLONG FINALLY MADE BOLD TO REMARK ANY HARM IN MY SAYING SO ON THE CONTRARY LAUGHED THE ATHLETE
DO YOU LOVE ME WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY ME MONA SHE PRETENDED TO BE VERY BUSY WITH THE DRIVING SO THAT BILLIE NEVER KNEW WHETHER FORT LOOKED ANXIOUS OR NOT PRESENTLY MONA SAID I THINK
IN WELCOME WHAT IS IT YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT YE'LL KEEP BACK THIS TRIAL AS LONG'S YE KIN RAISONABLY DO SO I KNOW THUR'S A PRESSYUR FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT I KNOW TOO THAT YE'VE GOT THE POWER TO RESIST IT
AFTER ADJUSTING THE BROKEN SHOE TO THE IMPERFECT HOOF PRINT AND TAKING IT UP AGAIN
FORT CALLED UPON THE SELF MADE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD I HAVE THE HONOR TO INFORM YOU SAID FORT COMING STRAIGHT TO THE POINT THAT MISS MONA HAS SEEN FIT TO ENCOURAGE MY SUIT
YOU WILL MARRY NO ONE BUT MARY BRUCE AT LAST YOU WILL SEE WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK NOW FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE PRISCILLA IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THE REGARD YOU PROFESS TO HAVE FOR MISS BRUCE TREAT HER NAME WITH SOME RESPECT I AM ACCEPTED BY MARGARET IBBOTSON I DARE SAY YOU ARE
SECRETARY REPLIED REBLONG A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY WAS FORT A SECRET INVESTIGATOR THEN YOU CAN TELL ME IS THERE ANY DISSATISFACTION ARE THE MEN ENTIRELY CONTENT WITH THEIR TREATMENT
WHICH GOD FORBID SHOULD EVER BE REQUIRED AMONG US EVEN HERE IN TEXAS I CAN GO SO FAR AS TO HINDER ANY OPEN VIOLATION OF THE LAW BUT I CANNOT GO AGAINST THE LAW ITSELF
WERE NOT UNCOMMON SCORES OF SOUTHERNERS WORE THEM IN TEXAS AS ELSEWHERE BUT HE KNEW THAT THE YOUNG IRISHMAN WAS ACCUSTOMED TO CARRY A MEXICAN SOMBRERO A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF HEAD GEAR IT WAS POSSIBLE HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN FIT TO CHANGE THE FASHION
IT WAS NIGHT IN MONA'S PART OF THE WORLD AND BILLIE HAD COME UPON THE GIRL JUST AS SHE WAS PREPARING FOR BED THANK YOU SHE SAID
THE YOUNG FELLUR HEV TUCK LEEVE O HIS SEVEN SENSES THUR'S FEVER IN THE FEEL O HIM HE AIR GONE DULLERIOUS PHELIM INSTANTLY OBEYED
ALL DEERBROOK WILL THANK ME IGNORANT AND STUPID AS DEERBROOK IS ABOUT MANY THINGS
AND HE HAD A MODE OF QUICKENING HER SPEED KNOWN ONLY TO HIMSELF AND ONLY EMPLOYED UPON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS IT SIMPLY CONSISTED IN DRAWING THE BOWIE KNIFE FROM HIS BELT AND INSERTING ABOUT IN INCH OF ITS BLADE INTO THE MARE'S HIP
YOU KNOW THAT HOPE IS AN ABLE AND MOST HUMANE MAN IN HIS PROFESSION AND THAT HE DOES NOT STEAL DEAD BODIES YOU KNOW THE FALSEHOOD OF THE WHOLE SET OF VULGAR STORIES
BUT THEY WILL WHEN THEY GITS THE CHANCE O ONE KRIPPLED AS HE AIR DURN EM THE HUNTER HAD ALL THE TALKING TO HIMSELF
BILLIE TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN THE DARTING PLAY OF THE LITTLE FLYLIKE MACHINES THE ACTION OF THE MECHANICAL CATAPULTS AND THE EASE WITH WHICH THE TWELVE INCH BALL WAS USUALLY CAUGHT IN THE BASKETS
IN SHORT SIR WITH THE STRANGE NEW NOTE OF RESOLUTION IN HIS VOICE I AM YOUR RIVAL FOR HER HAND I THOUGHT IT ONLY RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW POWART TOOK THIS AS HE TOOK EVERYTHING STANDING
SHE SENSED HIS EARNESTNESS AND SPOKE JUST AS SERIOUSLY IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE I HAVE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS BEFORE I WAS SLEEPY AND THE POINT IS WHAT DID I SAY SHE DEMANDED I DO NOT INTEND TO TELL YOU
IT WAS THE NAME OF LOUISE'S BROTHER
BUT NOT SHRINKING FROM THE FULL STATEMENT OF THE FACTS IF THAT SHOULD PROVE NECESSARY TO HOPE'S JUSTIFICATION IF THIS GENTLEMAN BE HONOURABLE HE WILL DECLINE ATTENDING MY MOTHER AND GO AWAY MORE WILLINGLY THAN HE CAME
TO KNOW THAT HIS MASTER STILL LIVED AND FURTHERMORE WAS IN NO DANGER OF DYING SUDDENLY CHANGED HIS MELANCHOLY WHINE TO A JUBILANT HULLABALLOO
I MOUT BE ARTER BELIEVIN MY OWN SKULL CASE WA'NT ANY LONGER ATWEEN MY SHOULDERS IT AIR NO USE LOOKIN TO HIM HE ADDED GLANCING TOWARDS MAURICE
TO TELL THE TRUTH POWART I HAVEN'T ANY PLAN AT ALL YET THANKS FOR THE EXEMPTION IN RETURN I ASSURE YOU THAT WHATEVER I DO WILL BE AS TRULY IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE AS WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
WHILE THE MARE WAS LEFT PANTING UPON THE PARADE GROUND THE OLD HUNTER HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING AN INTERVIEW WITH THE MILITARY CHIEF OF FORT INGE LOOKED UPON BY THE OFFICERS AS A SORT OF PRIVILEGED CHARACTER
I SAID SO BECAUSE IT IS TRUE
WITH ITS MYRIAD OF QUAINT OLD GABLES AND ACRE WIDE RED ROOFS DOTTED WITH DORMER WINDOWS TIER UPON TIER A LITTLE TO OUR RIGHT ROSE THE TOWERS OF THE BURG AND NEARER STILL STANDING GRIM THE TORTURE TOWER WHICH WAS AND IS PERHAPS THE MOST INTERESTING PLACE IN THE CITY
STOPPING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THEN GOING ON TOGETHER AGAIN ANYHOW NO MATTER HOW IT WAS DONE AND ELIAS P HUTCHESON BECAME ONE OF OUR PARTY STRAIGHTWAY AMELIA AND I FOUND THE PLEASANT BENEFIT INSTEAD OF QUARRELLING
LAID IT ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WITH MUCH EMOTION AND ASKED PERMISSION TO RETIRE FROM THE SERVICE OF A SOVEREIGN WHO DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SPARE A VANQUISHED ENEMY THE DUKE WAS STRUCK AND EVEN AFFECTED HE BADE THE COLONEL TAKE UP HIS COMMISSION
FOR THE SCIENCES WERE NOT YET DIVIDED AND THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY IRRATIONAL IN ARGUING THAT THE SAME LAWS WHICH REGULATED THE HEAVENLY BODIES WERE PARTIALLY APPLIED TO THE ERRING LIMBS OR BRAIN OF MAN
INDEED HER NAINSELL'S A TUME BELLY
WHO FIRST CONCEIVED THE WORLD TO BE A BODY MOVING ROUND THE SUN IN SPACE THERE IS NO TRUER OR MORE COMPREHENSIVE PRINCIPLE
YET SUCH WAS THE CONFIDENCE EXISTING BETWEEN THESE TWO HONOURABLE MEN THOUGH OF DIFFERENT POLITICAL PRINCIPLES THAT WHILE THE CIVIL WAR WAS RAGING AND STRAGGLING OFFICERS FROM THE HIGHLAND ARMY WERE EXECUTED WITHOUT MERCY INVERNAHYLE HESITATED
FIRST THEY APPLIED TO EXTERNAL NATURE THE RELATIONS OF THEM WHICH THEY FOUND IN THEIR OWN MINDS AND WHERE NATURE SEEMED TO BE AT VARIANCE WITH NUMBER
THEY WERE NOT LIKE BEING OR ESSENCE MERE VACANT ABSTRACTIONS BUT ADMITTED OF PROGRESS AND GROWTH
THE AUTHOR'S ADDRESS TO ALL IN GENERAL NOW GENTLE READERS I HAVE LET YOU KEN MY VERY THOUGHTS FROM HEART AND PEN TIS NEEDLESS FOR TO CONTEN OR YET CONTROULE FOR THERE'S NOT A WORD
AND THUS SEIZE THE MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS UNOBSERVED AND STEAL INTO THE THICKET WHEN SHE DEPOSITED WHATEVER SMALL STORE OF PROVISIONS SHE HAD IN CHARGE AT SOME MARKED SPOT WHERE HER FATHER MIGHT FIND IT INVERNAHYLE SUPPORTED LIFE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS BY MEANS OF THESE
NATURE IN THE ASPECT WHICH SHE PRESENTED TO A GREEK PHILOSOPHER OF THE FOURTH CENTURY BEFORE CHRIST IS NOT EASILY REPRODUCED TO MODERN EYES THE ASSOCIATIONS OF MYTHOLOGY AND POETRY HAVE TO BE ADDED
AND YET PROBABLY THEIR FIRST IMPRESSIONS THE ILLUSIONS AND MIRAGES OF THEIR FANCY CREATED A GREATER INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND MADE A NEARER APPROACH TO THE TRUTH THAN ANY PATIENT INVESTIGATION OF ISOLATED FACTS FOR WHICH THE TIME HAD NOT YET COME COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
WITH A STRING OF PUDDINGS HUNG ON A POLE WHIP'D O'ER HIS SHOULDER SKIPPED LIKE A FOLE CAUS'D MAGGY BANN LAP O'ER THE MIDDEN AND MIDDEN HOLE AND AFF HE RAN WHEN CHECK'D FOR THIS THEY'D OFTEN TELL YE
THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONTENT OF NOTIONS IS IN INVERSE PROPORTION TO THEIR UNIVERSALITY THE ELEMENT WHICH IS THE MOST WIDELY DIFFUSED IS ALSO THE THINNEST OR IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE COMMON LOGIC THE GREATER THE EXTENSION THE LESS THE COMPREHENSION
A SMALL ENCAMPMENT OF SOLDIERS WAS FORMED ON INVERNAHYLE'S PROPERTY WHICH THEY SPARED WHILE PLUNDERING THE COUNTRY AROUND AND SEARCHING IN EVERY DIRECTION FOR THE LEADERS OF THE INSURRECTION AND FOR STEWART IN PARTICULAR
THEY MAY BE SAID MORE TRULY TO HAVE CLEARED UP AND DEFINED BY THE HELP OF EXPERIENCE IDEAS WHICH THEY ALREADY POSSESSED THE BEGINNINGS OF THOUGHT ABOUT NATURE MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS CHARACTER A TRUE METHOD IS THE RESULT OF MANY AGES OF EXPERIMENT AND OBSERVATION AND
WHICH HAVE BEEN BARREN AND UNPRODUCTIVE WE MIGHT AS WELL MAINTAIN THAT GREEK ART WAS NOT REAL OR GREAT BECAUSE IT HAD NIHIL SIMILE AUT SECUNDUM
SOON AN INNER WORLD OF IDEAS BEGAN TO BE UNFOLDED MORE ABSORBING MORE OVERPOWERING MORE ABIDING THAN THE BRIGHTEST OF VISIBLE OBJECTS WHICH TO THE EYE OF THE PHILOSOPHER LOOKING INWARD SEEMED TO PALE BEFORE THEM RETAINING ONLY A FAINT
I WILL DROP IT NEAR THE KITTEN AND THEY WILL BOTH WONDER WHERE IT CAME FROM OH BE CAREFUL SAID MY WIFE YOU MIGHT HIT THE DEAR LITTLE THING NOT ME MA'AM SAID ELIAS P WHY I'M AS TENDER AS A MAINE CHERRY TREE LOR BLESS YE
THE OTHER PROPERTIES OF OBJECTS SEEMED TO REAPPEAR ONLY IN THE LIGHT OF NUMBER LAW AND MORALITY ALSO FOUND A NATURAL EXPRESSION IN NUMBER AND FIGURE INSTRUMENTS OF SUCH POWER AND ELASTICITY COULD NOT FAIL TO BE
THEY SUGGESTED THE FIRST OBSERVATION OF THE EFFECTS OF FIRE AND WATER ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE TO THE ANCIENT PHYSICS THEY STOOD MUCH IN THE SAME RELATION WHICH GEOLOGY DOES TO MODERN SCIENCE BUT THE GREEK WAS NOT LIKE THE ENQUIRER OF THE LAST GENERATION
AND SEVERAL TO THE EXTENT AND OF THE NATURE JOCULARLY IMPUTED TO THEM BY THE BARON WERE REALLY LAID TO THE CHARGE OF THE HIGHLAND INSURGENTS FOR WHICH MANY TRADITIONS AND PARTICULARLY ONE RESPECTING THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRROR MAY BE QUOTED AS GOOD EVIDENCE
HAVING LONG MEDITATED ON THE PROPERTIES OF ONE TWO FOUR EIGHT OR ONE THREE NINE TWENTY SEVEN OR OF THREE FOUR FIVE THEY DISCOVERED IN THEM MANY CURIOUS CORRESPONDENCES AND WERE DISPOSED TO FIND IN THEM THE SECRET OF THE UNIVERSE
THE DREAMS AND VISIONS WHICH PASS THROUGH THE PHILOSOPHER'S MIND OF RESEMBLANCES BETWEEN DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SUBSTANCES OR BETWEEN THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE WORLD ARE PUT INTO THE REFINER'S FIRE
LAWS OR FORMS OF ART AND MUSIC WHICH HAD LASTED NOT IN WORD ONLY BUT IN VERY TRUTH FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS
AND THEN WE PASSED THROUGH THE LONG DIM ARCHWAY AND CAME TO THE GATE OF THE BURG
THE OFFICER PROVED TO BE COLONEL WHITEFOORD AN AYRSHIRE GENTLEMAN OF HIGH CHARACTER AND INFLUENCE
TWO ARE TRUER THAN THREE ONE THAN TWO THE WORDS BEING OR UNITY OR ESSENCE OR GOOD BECAME SACRED TO THEM THEY DID NOT SEE THAT THEY HAD A WORD ONLY AND IN ONE SENSE THE MOST UNMEANING OF WORDS
INVERNAHYLE WAS AFTERWARDS PARDONED UNDER THE ACT OF INDEMNITY THE AUTHOR KNEW HIM WELL AND HAS OFTEN HEARD THESE CIRCUMSTANCES FROM HIS OWN MOUTH HE WAS A NOBLE SPECIMEN OF THE OLD HIGHLANDER FAR DESCENDED GALLANT
IT MUST REMAIN UNCERTAIN WHETHER WAVERLEY BE THE WORK OF A POET OR A CRITIC A LAWYER OR A CLERGYMAN OR WHETHER THE WRITER TO USE MISSUS MALAPROP'S PHRASE BE
TO THE LORD ADVOCATE AND TO ALL THE OFFICERS OF STATE AND EACH APPLICATION WAS ANSWERED BY THE PRODUCTION OF A LIST IN WHICH INVERNAHYLE
TO SMITE THE WOUNDED ON THE FIELL IT'S JUST THEY GOT SUCH GROATS IN KAIL WHO DO THE SAME IT ONLY TEACHES CRUELTYS REAL TO THEM AGAIN I'VE SEEN THE MEN CALL'D HIGHLAND ROGUES
HE THEN LIMITED HIS REQUEST FOR THE PRESENT TO A PROTECTION FOR STEWART'S HOUSE WIFE CHILDREN AND PROPERTY THIS WAS ALSO REFUSED BY THE DUKE ON WHICH COLONEL WHITEFOORD TAKING HIS COMMISSION FROM HIS BOSOM
HAS OVER THE MIND LANGUAGE TWO EXERCISED A SPELL OVER THE BEGINNINGS OF PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY LEADING TO ERROR AND SOMETIMES TO TRUTH FOR MANY THOUGHTS WERE SUGGESTED BY THE DOUBLE MEANINGS OF WORDS
WHEN REVIEWING THE TALES OF MY LANDLORD FOR THE QUARTERLY REVIEW IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN THE PARTICULARS WERE DERIVED BY THE CRITIC FROM THE AUTHOR'S INFORMATION
FURTHER TENDED TO PERPLEX THEM PLATO'S DOCTRINE OF THE SAME AND THE OTHER RULING THE COURSES OF THE HEAVENS AND OF THE HUMAN BODY IS NOT A MERE VAGARY BUT IS A NATURAL RESULT OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE AND THOUGHT AT WHICH HE HAD ARRIVED
BY A PARTY OF THE ENEMY WHO FIRED AT AND PURSUED HIM THE FUGITIVE BEING FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ESCAPE THEIR SEARCH THEY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AND CHARGED THE FAMILY WITH HARBOURING ONE OF THE PROSCRIBED TRAITORS
BUT THE STONE FELL WITH A SICKENING THUD THAT CAME UP TO US THROUGH THE HOT AIR RIGHT ON THE KITTEN'S HEAD AND SHATTERED OUT ITS LITTLE BRAINS THEN AND THERE THE BLACK CAT CAST A SWIFT UPWARD GLANCE AND WE SAW HER EYES LIKE GREEN FIRE FIXED AN INSTANT ON ELIAS P HUTCHESON
APPEARED MARKED WITH THE SIGN OF THE BEAST AS A SUBJECT UNFIT FOR FAVOUR OR PARDON AT LENGTH COLONEL WHITEFOORD APPLIED TO THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND IN PERSON FROM HIM ALSO HE RECEIVED A POSITIVE REFUSAL
OR OF JUSTICE SYMBOLIZING THE LAW OF COMPENSATION ARE OF THE FATES AND FURIES TYPIFYING THE FIXED ORDER OR THE EXTRAORDINARY CONVULSIONS OF NATURE THEIR OWN INTERPRETATIONS OF HOMER AND THE POETS WERE SUPPOSED BY THEM TO BE THE ORIGINAL MEANING
IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A PRIORI THOUGHT AND INDEED OF THINKING AT ALL MEN WERE LED TO CONCEIVE IT NOT BY A LOVE OF HASTY GENERALIZATION BUT BY A DIVINE INSTINCT
NUMBER AND FIGURE WERE THE GREATEST INSTRUMENTS OF THOUGHT WHICH WERE POSSESSED BY THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER HAVING THE SAME POWER OVER THE MIND WHICH WAS EXERTED BY ABSTRACT IDEAS
IN QUEST OF PLUNDER I KNOW NOT IF HIS PLAN WAS ATTENDED TO I RATHER THINK IT SEEMED TOO HAZARDOUS TO THE CONSTITUTED AUTHORITIES WHO MIGHT NOT EVEN AT THAT TIME DESIRE TO SEE ARMS IN HIGHLAND HANDS
THE AIR WHICH IS THE BREATH OF LIFE THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE OF FIRE THE SEEMING REGULARITY OF THE GREATER PART OF NATURE AND THE IRREGULARITY OF A REMNANT THE RECURRENCE OF DAY AND NIGHT AND OF THE SEASONS THE SOLID EARTH
THEY CURSED THE REBEL SCOTS THAT DAY AS THEY'D BEEN NOWT BROUGHT UP FOR SLAUGHTER AS THAT WAY TOO MANY ROWT THEREFORE ALAS DEAR COUNTRYMEN O NEVER DO THE LIKE AGAIN TO THIRST FOR VENGEANCE NEVER BEN
WERE CLOSELY WATCHED WITH INGENUITY BEYOND HER YEARS THE CHILD USED TO STRAY ABOUT AMONG THE SOLDIERS
I KEM ON THE CAMP JUST IN TIME TO SEE SPLINTERS PASS IN HIS CHECKS
WHY I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD IT OCCUR ON NO ACCOUNT HE CAME OVER TO AMELIA AND APOLOGISED PROFUSELY AND SHE WITH HER USUAL KINDNESS OF HEART HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM THAT SHE QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THEN WE ALL WENT AGAIN TO THE WALL AND LOOKED OVER
SECONDLY THEY APPLIED NUMBER AND FIGURE EQUALLY TO THOSE PARTS OF PHYSICS SUCH AS ASTRONOMY OR MECHANICS IN WHICH THE MODERN PHILOSOPHER EXPECTS TO FIND THEM AND TO THOSE IN WHICH HE WOULD NEVER THINK OF LOOKING FOR THEM SUCH AS PHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY
TO HIS EXPERIENCE HE WAS READY TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENA OF THE HEAVENS BY THE MOST TRIVIAL ANALOGIES OF EARTH THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH NATURE WORKED FOR HIM HE SOMETIMES ACCEPTED
SUCH CRUELTY APPROV'D BY EVERY AGE I SHOOK MY HEAD SO MANY TO CURSE SO FEW TO PRAY AND SOME ALOUD
EARLY SCIENCE IS NOT A PROCESS OF DISCOVERY IN THE MODERN SENSE BUT RATHER A PROCESS OF CORRECTING BY OBSERVATION
ARISTOTELIANS OR PLATONISTS LIKE SOME PHILOSOPHERS IN MODERN TIMES WHO ARE ACCUSED OF MAKING A THEORY FIRST AND FINDING THEIR FACTS AFTERWARDS THE ADVOCATES OF EITHER OPINION NEVER THOUGHT OF APPLYING EITHER TO THEMSELVES
UPON THEIR NATIONAL CHARACTER NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM HIS WISH OR INTENTION THE CHARACTER OF CALLUM BEG IS THAT OF A SPIRIT NATURALLY TURNED TO DARING EVIL AND DETERMINED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS SITUATION TO A PARTICULAR SPECIES OF MISCHIEF
HAD IT BEEN IT WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE SO SPICK AND SPAN PERFECT AS IT IS AT PRESENT THE DITCH HAS NOT BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES AND NOW ITS BASE IS SPREAD WITH TEA GARDENS AND ORCHARDS OF WHICH SOME OF THE TREES ARE OF QUITE RESPECTABLE GROWTH AS WE WANDERED ROUND THE WALL
THE TENDENCY TO MERE ABSTRACTIONS NOT PERCEIVING THAT PURE ABSTRACTION IS ONLY NEGATION THEY THOUGHT THAT THE GREATER THE ABSTRACTION THE GREATER THE TRUTH BEHIND ANY PAIR OF IDEAS A NEW IDEA WHICH COMPREHENDED THEM
THEY WERE BRINGING ORDER OUT OF DISORDER
AND GRANTED THE PROTECTION HE REQUIRED IT WAS ISSUED JUST IN TIME TO SAVE THE HOUSE CORN AND CATTLE AT INVERNAHYLE FROM THE TROOPS WHO WERE ENGAGED IN LAYING WASTE WHAT IT WAS THE FASHION TO CALL THE COUNTRY OF THE ENEMY
TO WHOM THE REPUTATION OF BEING A NOVEL WRITER MIGHT BE PREJUDICIAL OR HE MAY BE A MAN OF FASHION TO WHOM WRITING OF ANY KIND MIGHT APPEAR PEDANTIC HE MAY BE TOO YOUNG TO ASSUME THE CHARACTER OF AN AUTHOR OR SO OLD AS TO MAKE IT ADVISABLE TO LAY IT ASIDE
A BATTERY OF FOUR FIELD PIECES WAS STORMED AND CARRIED BY THE CAMERONS AND THE STEWARTS OF APPINE THE LATE ALEXANDER STEWART OF INVERNAHYLEWAS
HE HAD MADE CONSIDERABLE PROFICIENCY THERE WERE OTHERS SUCH AS CHEMISTRY ELECTRICITY MECHANICS OF WHICH THE VERY NAMES WERE UNKNOWN TO HIM HE WAS THE NATURAL ENEMY OF MYTHOLOGY AND YET MYTHOLOGICAL IDEAS STILL RETAINED THEIR HOLD OVER HIM
AND THE DROSS AND OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH ADHERE TO THEM ARE PURGED AWAY BUT THE CONTEMPORARY OF PLATO AND SOCRATES WAS INCAPABLE OF RESISTING THE POWER
CONNECTED WITH SOME THEORY OF ONE TWO OR MORE ELEMENTS
THOUGH INCAPABLE OF INDUCTION OR GENERALIZATION IN THE MODERN SENSE THEY CAUGHT AN INSPIRATION FROM THE EXTERNAL WORLD
AND SO THERE BEGAN TO BE A REAL SYMPATHY BETWEEN THE WORLD WITHIN AND THE WORLD WITHOUT THE NUMBERS AND FIGURES WHICH WERE PRESENT TO THE MIND'S EYE BECAME VISIBLE TO THE EYE OF SENSE THE TRUTH OF NATURE WAS MATHEMATICS
THE MODERN PHYSICIST CONFINES HIMSELF TO ONE OR PERHAPS TWO BRANCHES OF SCIENCE BUT HE COMPARATIVELY SELDOM RISES ABOVE HIS OWN DEPARTMENT AND OFTEN FALLS UNDER THE NARROWING INFLUENCE WHICH ANY SINGLE BRANCH WHEN PURSUED TO THE EXCLUSION OF EVERY OTHER
ANIMATED BY A PRINCIPLE OF MOTION IMMANENT IN A PRINCIPLE OF REST HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO CONSTRUCT THE UNIVERSE ON A QUANTITATIVE PRINCIPLE SEEMING TO FIND IN ENDLESS COMBINATIONS OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES OR IN THE INFINITE VARIETY OF THEIR SIZES
SHARP TEETH SEEMED TO ALMOST SHINE THROUGH THE BLOOD WHICH DABBLED HER MOUTH AND WHISKERS SHE GNASHED HER TEETH AND HER CLAWS STOOD OUT STARK AND AT FULL LENGTH ON EVERY PAW
BUT HE NEVER TRIED EXPERIMENTS FOR HIMSELF WHICH WOULD EITHER PROVE OR DISPROVE HIS THEORIES HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS UNEQUAL
WELL WE DID NURNBERG TOGETHER AND MUCH ENJOYED THE RACY REMARKS OF OUR TRANSATLANTIC FRIEND
AS WE HAD BEEN DOING WE FOUND THAT THE RESTRAINING INFLUENCE OF A THIRD PARTY WAS SUCH THAT WE NOW TOOK EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF SPOONING IN ODD CORNERS AMELIA DECLARES THAT EVER SINCE SHE HAS AS THE RESULT OF THAT EXPERIENCE ADVISED ALL HER FRIENDS TO TAKE A FRIEND ON THE HONEYMOON
WHENCE RAN THE STEEP PAVED ROADWAY BETWEEN THE BURG AND THE PENTAGONAL TORTURE TOWER AS WE CROSSED THE BRIDGE WE SAW THE CAT AGAIN DOWN BELOW US
ARE NOT AS GREAT UPON THE WHOLE AS THOSE MADE BY THEIR SUCCESSORS
DIVINE PROPORTIONS AND TO COMPREHEND ALL TRUTH BEING OR ESSENCE AND SIMILAR WORDS REPRESENTED TO THEM A SUPREME OR DIVINE BEING IN WHICH THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY FOUND THE CONTAINING AND CONTINUING PRINCIPLE OF THE UNIVERSE
BUT ALSO A GREAT INTELLIGENCE HAVING AN INSIGHT INTO NATURE AND OFTEN ANTICIPATIONS OF THE TRUTH HE WAS FULL OF ORIGINAL THOUGHTS AND YET LIABLE TO BE IMPOSED UPON BY THE MOST OBVIOUS FALLACIES HE OCCASIONALLY CONFUSED NUMBERS WITH IDEAS AND ATOMS WITH NUMBERS
WHEN IN MODERN TIMES WE CONTEMPLATE THE HEAVENS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SCIENTIFIC TRUTH IMPERCEPTIBLY BLENDS EVEN WITH THE CURSORY GLANCE OF AN UNSCIENTIFIC PERSON
THEY WERE ALSO CAPABLE OF PRACTICAL APPLICATION MANY CURIOUS AND TO THE EARLY THINKER MYSTERIOUS PROPERTIES OF THEM CAME TO LIGHT WHEN THEY WERE COMPARED WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY ADMITTED OF INFINITE MULTIPLICATION AND CONSTRUCTION
IT SHUT OFF FIELDS OF HIGH GRASS BLOCKED AT EVERY FIFTY YARDS WITH GREAT BARRICADES OF UNDERGROWTH AND TANGLED TREES AND CHAPPARAL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIL
A BOY WAS LYING WITH A BULLET WOUND BETWEEN HIS EYES HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING WITH SHORT HOARSE NOISES WHICH I GUESSED WERE DUE TO SOME MUSCULAR ACTION ENTIRELY AND THAT HE WAS VIRTUALLY DEAD
BUT WALKED ERECT STILL SMILING ROOSEVELT POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADVANCE FARTHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE NETWORK OF WILD GRAPE VINES THAT MASKED THE SPANIARDS FROM US AND THAT WE MUST CROSS THE TRAIL
WAS NO MORE THAN A MAN COVERS IN SLIDING FOR A BASE AT OTHER TIMES HALF A TROOP WOULD RISE AND RACE FORWARD AND THEN BURROW DEEP IN THE HOT GRASS AND FIRE
WHEN SHOT THROUGH THE BODY ASKED TO BE PROPPED UP AGAINST A TREE WITH HIS CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT BESIDE HIM AND THE LAST HIS TROOP SAW OF HIM HE WAS SEATED ALONE GRIMLY FIRING OVER THEIR HEADS
NOR EVEN A COLLECTION OF HOUSES IT IS THE MEETING PLACE OF TWO TRAILS WHICH JOIN AT THE APEX OF A V THREE MILES FROM THE SEAPORT TOWN OF SIBONEY AND CONTINUE MERGED IN A SINGLE TRAIL TO SANTIAGO
AS AN EXCUSE TO GO TO LEAVE THE FIRING LINE I HAVE WATCHED OTHER FIGHTS WHERE THE MEN ENGAGED WERE QUITE WILLING TO UNSELFISHLY BEAR THE WOUNDED FROM THE ZONE OF DANGER
GENERAL WHEELER GUIDED BY THE CUBANS RECONNOITRED THIS TRAIL ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE AND WITH THE POSITION OF THE ENEMY FULLY EXPLAINED TO HIM RETURNED TO SIBONEY AND INFORMED GENERAL YOUNG AND COLONEL WOOD
GRAVE BOYISH FACES FILLED WITH SYMPATHY AND CONCERN ONLY FIFTY FEET FROM HIM AND FARTHER DOWN THE TRAIL I PASSED HIS CAPTAIN WITH HIS BODY PROPPED AGAINST CHURCH'S KNEE
FOR THE WOUNDED LYING ALONG ITS LENGTH WERE AS STILL AS THE DEAD BESIDE THEM THE NOISE OF THE LOOSE STONES ROLLING UNDER MY FEET BROUGHT A HOSPITAL STEWARD OUT OF THE BRUSH AND HE CALLED AFTER ME
BELOW THEM WAS THE BEACH AND THE ROARING SURF IN WHICH A THOUSAND OR SO NAKED MEN WERE ASSISTING AND IMPEDING THE PROGRESS SHOREWARD OF THEIR COMRADES IN PONTOONS AND SHORE BOATS
THE FIRE DISCIPLINE WAS EXCELLENT THE PROPHETS OF EVIL OF THE TAMPA BAY HOTEL HAD FORETOLD THAT THE COWBOYS WOULD SHOOT AS THEY CHOSE AND IN THE FIELD WOULD ACT INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR OFFICERS
IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR WOOD AND ROOSEVELT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE CAPTAINS AND AFTER THE FIRST GENERAL ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM THEY RELIED UPON THE LATTER'S INTELLIGENCE TO PULL THEM THROUGH
AND AS SPANISH TROOPS HATE BEING RUSHED AS A CAT HATES WATER THEY FIRED A FEW PARTING VOLLEYS AND BROKE AND RAN THE CHEERING HAD THE SAME INVIGORATING EFFECT ON OUR OWN SIDE AS A COLD SHOWER
WHICH WERE BEING HURLED AT THE BEACH LIKE SLEDS DOWN A WATER CHUTE IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST WEIRD AND REMARKABLE SCENES OF THE WAR PROBABLY OF ANY WAR
LARGE AND POWERFULLY BUILT HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE LEG JUST BELOW THE TRUNK AND I FOUND HIM LYING ON A BLANKET HALF NAKED AND COVERED WITH BLOOD AND WITH HIS LEG BOUND IN TOURNIQUETS MADE OF TWIGS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS
AT SIBONEY ROWLAND SAT STILL FOR A SHORT TIME
STRANGELY MEAN AND TAWDRY
BUT TIME AFTER TIME THEY ROSE AND STAGGERED FORWARD THROUGH THE HIGH GRASS
AND THE FACT THAT OUR MEN COULD NOT SEE THEIR OPPONENTS THEIR OWN MEN FELL OR ROLLED OVER ON EVERY SIDE SHOT DOWN BY AN INVISIBLE ENEMY WITH NO ONE UPON WHOM THEY COULD RETALIATE
IT HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO A DRESSING STATION AND THE WOUNDED OF G TROOP WERE LEFT THERE IN THE CARE OF THE HOSPITAL STEWARDS A TALL GAUNT YOUNG MAN WITH A CROSS ON HIS ARM WAS JUST COMING BACK UP THE TRAIL HIS HEAD WAS BENT
BEARER BACK TO CLIMB THE HILL AND WAVE HIS RED AND WHITE BANNER WHERE YOUNG'S MEN COULD SEE IT
LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT RAN UP JUST THEN BRINGING WITH HIM LIEUTENANT WOODBURY KANE AND TEN TROOPERS FROM K TROOP ROOSEVELT LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS BESIDE LLEWELLYN AND CONSULTED WITH HIM EAGERLY
I KNEW IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AND YET HE WAS CERTAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER TIME OF EXCITEMENT AND RUSH AND HEAT THEN I REMEMBERED HIM AS NOW HE HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BLOOD AND DIRT AND PERSPIRATION
YOU CAN START AT ONCE BUT IF YOU WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW WHEN I CAN SPARE THE MEN YOU CAN BE CARRIED ALL THE WAY
THE ENEMY'S FIRE WAS SO CLOSE THAT THE MEN COULD NOT HEAR THE WORD OF COMMAND AND CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN AND LIEUTENANT GREENWAY UNABLE TO GET THEIR ATTENTION RAN AMONG THEM
NO FLANKERS WERE PLACED FOR THE REASON THAT THE DENSE UNDERGROWTH AND THE TANGLE OF VINES THAT STRETCHED FROM THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES TO THE BUSHES BELOW MADE IT A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
IT WAS APPARENTLY THE BODY OF THE FIRST MAN KILLED AFTER DEATH THE BODIES OF SOME MEN SEEM TO SHRINK ALMOST INSTANTLY WITHIN THEMSELVES THEY BECOME LIMP AND SHAPELESS
WOOD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN ALONG IT LEADING HIS HORSE WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE OF USE IN CASE HE HAD TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ALTER HIS ORIGINAL FORMATION
HIS PLAN AT PRESENT WAS TO SPREAD OUT HIS MEN SO THAT THEY WOULD JOIN YOUNG ON THE RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT SWING AROUND UNTIL THEY FLANKED THE ENEMY K AND A TROOPS
BLOCKING THE WAY TO SANTIAGO
DODGING FROM TREE TRUNK TO TREE TRUNK AND FROM ONE BUSH TO ANOTHER THEY FELL INTO LINE AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE OTHERS BUT WHILE DOING SO THEY HAD NOT ONCE EXPOSED THEMSELVES
WHICH WERE WELL ALREADY IN ADVANCE
WHEN WE FIRED A VOLLEY ONE OF THE PRISONERS SAID LATER INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK THEY CAME FORWARD THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO FIGHT TO COME CLOSER AT EVERY VOLLEY
AND EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEM HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN UNDER FIRE NOR HAD ONE MAN IN THE REGIMENT EVER FIRED A KRAG JORGENSEN CARBINE UNTIL HE FIRED IT AT A SPANIARD
AND AT THE BATTLE OF SAN JUAN LATER WHEN HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE ARM WAS PROMOTED TO BE CAPTAIN OF L TROOP OR AS IT WAS LATER OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED CAPRON'S TROOP HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE LINE AS UNCONCERNEDLY
AND THE COLLEGE SWELLS OF THE ROUGH RIDERS
AND I WAS RUNNING FORWARD FEELING CONFIDENT THAT I MUST BE CLOSE ON OUR MEN WHEN I SAW THE BODY OF A SERGEANT BLOCKING THE TRAIL AND STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH ACROSS IT
FOR AGUARDIENTE AND WAS NOW OCCUPIED IN FORCE BY THE ENEMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT ON THE FAR LEFT WAS MOVING UP HIS MEN WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING THIS HOUSE ON THE FLANK
A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES AND UPHILL ALL THE WAY CARRYING HIS CARBINE CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN HOSPITAL WOOD SAID I WAS ROWLAND ANSWERED SHEEPISHLY
THE CONDITIONS WERE EXCEPTIONAL
OR OF BEING CARRIED A DAY LATER ON A LITTER
AND THAT SO FEW OF THEM DIED IS GREATLY DUE TO THIS YOUNG MAN WHO WENT DOWN INTO THE FIRING LINE AND PULLED THEM FROM IT AND BORE THEM OUT OF DANGER
STORMING A RIDGE EQUALLY WORTHY OF PRAISE BUT IT HAS SEEMED BETTER NOT TO TRY AND TELL OF ANYTHING I DID NOT SEE BUT TO LIMIT MYSELF TO THE WORK OF THE ROUGH RIDERS TO WHOM AFTER ALL THE VICTORY WAS DUE
CAN YOU STAND BEING CARRIED DO YOU THINK YOU CAN CARRY ME THE TROOPER ASKED YES WELL EXCLAIMED THE BOY ADMIRINGLY YOU CERTAINLY KNOW YOUR BUSINESS
F AND E TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED IN SKIRMISH LINE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE FENCE WOOD HAD DISCOVERED THE ENEMY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE HE EXPECTED TO FIND HIM AND SO FAR FROM BEING SURPRISED HE HAD TIME
I BORROWED A CARBINE FROM A WOUNDED MAN AND JOINED THE REMNANT OF L TROOP WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE TRAIL THIS TROOP WAS THEN COMMANDED BY SECOND LIEUTENANT DAY WHO ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CONDUCT THAT MORNING
AND INTO A HUGE MEXICAN SADDLE HE STUCK HIS WOUNDED ANKLE INTO ONE STIRRUP AND HIS UNTOUCHED ONE INTO THE OTHER AND GATHERED UP THE REINS DOES IT PAIN YOU CAN YOU STAND IT
THEIR LIMBS UNUSED TO SUCH EXERTION AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF CRAMPED IDLENESS ON THE TROOP SHIP TREMBLED WITH WEAKNESS AND THE SUN BLINDED
WITH IT AND THAT THOUGH THEY MIGHT PECK AND MEND AT THE BODY HE HAD RECEIVED HIS FINAL ORDERS
AS THOUGH WE WERE AT TARGET PRACTICE AND AN IRISH SERGEANT BYRNE WAS ASSISTING HIM BY KEEPING UP A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF COMMENTS AND CRITICISMS THAT SHOWED THE KEENEST ENJOYMENT OF THE SITUATION
BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WE STUMBLED OVER THE STONES AND VINES BUMPING HIS WOUNDED BODY AGAINST THE GROUND AND LEAVING A BLACK STREAK IN THE GRASS BEHIND US BUT IT SEEMED TO HURT US MORE THAN IT DID HIM
OR SHOUTING WITH DELIGHT AS THEY PLUNGED INTO THE FIRST BATH THAT HAD OFFERED IN SEVEN DAYS AND THOSE IN THE LAUNCHES AS THEY WERE PITCHED HEAD FIRST AT THE SOIL OF CUBA SIGNALIZED THEIR ARRIVAL BY HOWLS OF TRIUMPH
WOOD AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE DECIDED AT THE SAME TIME UPON THE SAME MANOEUVRE IT WAS CALLED WOOD'S BLUFF AFTERWARD FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO BACK IT WITH
A SOLDIER TO DUTY THAT HE CONTINUED WRITING HIS ACCOUNT OF THE FIGHT
AND RAN FOR THE COVER THEY WERE DIRECTED TO TAKE LIKE MEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN AND FELL PANTING ON THEIR FACES WHILE THE WESTERN TRAPPERS AND HUNTERS SLIPPED AND WRIGGLED THROUGH THE GRASS LIKE INDIANS
AND PASSING THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF CONVULSIONS HE NEVERTHELESS IN HIS BRIEF MOMENTS OF COMPARATIVE PEACE BORE HIMSELF WITH THE UTMOST CALM
AND ROOSEVELT WAS SO CLOSE TO ONE BULLET WHEN IT STRUCK A TREE THAT IT FILLED HIS EYES AND EARS WITH TINY SPLINTERS MAJOR BRODIE AND LIEUTENANT THOMAS WERE BOTH WOUNDED WITHIN A FEW FEET OF COLONEL WOOD
AND WHAT HE WAS TO DO WHEN HE FOUND HIM THAT NIGHT NO ONE SLEPT FOR UNTIL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TROOPS WERE STILL BEING DISEMBARKED IN THE SURF AND TWO SHIPS OF WAR HAD THEIR SEARCHLIGHTS TURNED ON THE LANDING PLACE
LAY THE CAMP OF THE ROUGH RIDERS AND THROUGH IT CUBAN OFFICERS WERE RIDING THEIR HALF STARVED PONIES AND SCATTERING THE ASHES OF THE CAMP FIRES
BYRNE WAS THE ONLY MAN I NOTICED WHO SEEMED TO REGARD THE FIGHT AS IN ANY WAY HUMOROUS
SOME PLACE WHERE THERE IS SHADE AND A BREEZE
WITH NO SIGN THAT THE ATTACK MIGHT NOT GO ON INDEFINITELY YET THEY NEVER ONCE TOOK A STEP BACKWARD BUT ADVANCED GRIMLY CLEANING A BUSH OR THICKET OF ITS OCCUPANTS BEFORE CHARGING IT
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE THICKET AT ONE MOMENT THE UNDERBRUSH SEEMED SWARMING WITH OUR MEN AND THE NEXT EXCEPT THAT YOU HEARD THE TWIGS BREAKING AND HEAVY BREATHING OR A CRASH AS A VINE PULLED SOME ONE DOWN
WHOSE GIFTS AND FAVOURS HAVE NOR COUNT NOR BOUND NO STROKE OF ALL FATE'S STROKES E'ER FELL ON ME BUT THEE TO TAKE ME BY THE HAND I FOUND
TILL HE HAD BEHEADED ON HER ACCOUNT FORTY DOCTORS AND CRUCIFIED FORTY ASTROLOGERS WHEREFOR THE GENERAL HELD ALOOF FROM HER ALL THE PHYSICIANS HAVING FAILED TO MEDICINE HER MALADY
FOR BOTH HIS FEET WERE SWOLLEN SO THEY ABODE THERE THREE DAYS TILL THEY WERE RESTED
CAST HIMSELF AT THEIR FEET AND EXCLAIMED
AND FOR THE VIOLENCE OF MY PASSION AND LONGING I HAVE NEVER SAVOURED THE TASTE OF SLEEP AND HAVE NO OCCUPATION SAVE WEEPING ALWAY AND REPEATING VERSES NIGHT AND DAY AND THIS O MY BROTHER IS MY STORY
NOR SHALL THEY TILL NEXT LIFE THY SIGHT DESCRY
THEN DO THOU REPEAT TO HIM THESE TWO COUPLETS WOMEN ARE SATANS MADE FOR WOE O MEN I FLY TO ALLAH FROM THEIR DEVILISH SCATHE SOURCE OF WHATEVER BALE BEFEL OUR KIND IN WORDLY MATTERS AND IN THINGS OF FAITH
AND THEN FARE FORTH AND SPEAK OF OUR SECRETS TO ANY I WILL ASSUREDLY STRIKE OFF THY HEAD BEFORE HIS FOR THOU O MY MINISTER ART THE CAUSE OF ALL THAT HATH BETIDED US FIRST AND LAST NOW DO AS THOU WILT
THE KING REPLIED O THOU WAZIR
BUT MOURNING AND WATCHING STICK FAST TO ME AND DESIRE AND PASSION TORMENT ME AND THE EXTREMES OF LANGUOR AND SICKNESS HAVE SHEET ME YET MAY MY LIFE BE A RANSOM FOR THEE ALBEIT THY PLEASURE BE TO SLAY HER WHO LOVETH THEE
THE EMIR SPRANG UP MARVELLING AT THIS ESCAPE
ENTER BUT DO NOT PROLONG THY STAY SO THEY WENT IN AND WHEN MARZAWAN BEHELD THE LADY BUDUR IN THE AFORESAID PLIGHT HE SALUTED HER AFTER HIS MOTHER HAD DOFFED HIS WOMAN'S GARB THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THEIR SATCHEL BOOKS HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM
WOULD TO HEAVEN WE HAD BEEN SLAIN AND WERE AT PEACE FROM THIS PAIN BUT WE KNOW NOT WHITHER THE HORSE HATH FLED THAT THE TREASURER IS GONE AND HATH LEFT US THUS PINIONED
IN ANY CASE THEY ARE THY SONS AND IT BEFITTETH NOT THAT THOU KILL THEM WITH SHINE OWN HAND
IT SO CAME TO PASS THAT HE FOUND IN THE POCKET OF HIS SON AS'AD'S RAIMENT A LETTER IN THE HAND OF HIS WIFE ENCLOSING HER HAIR STRINGS
SLAY ME BEFORE MY BROTHER AS'AD SO HAPLY SHALL THE FIRE BE QUENCHT IN MY HEART'S CORE AND IN THIS LIFE BURN NO MORE BUT AS'AD WEPT AND EXCLAIMED NOT SO I WILL DIE FIRST
WHEN MARZAWAN HEARD THESE WORDS HE SAID I MUST NEEDS GO IN TO HER PERADVENTURE I MAY DISCOVER WHAT SHE HATH AND BE ABLE TO MEDICINE HER
THAT WHEN HIS HORSE RAN AWAY THE TREASURER RAN AFTER IT IN HUGE CONCERN AND CEASED NOT RUNNING TO CATCH THE RUNAWAY TILL IT ENTERED A THICKET
AND DISCOVERING TO HER WHAT WAS IN HER HEART
AND I ALSO HE REPLIED ALLAH UPON THEE O WAZIR I IMPLORE THEE OF THY FAVOUR ACQUAINT ME TOUCHING THIS YOUTH THOU DESCRIBEST WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THE CONDITION IN WHICH HE IS THE WAZIR REPLIED
MOREOVER HE DISTRIBUTED ALMS TO THE POOR AND NEEDY AND SET FREE ALL THE PRISONERS THE WHOLE WORLD REJOICED IN THE COMING OF KAMAR AL ZAMAN TO THE THRONE BLESSING HIM AND WISHING HIM ENDURANCE OF GLORY AND PROSPERITY RENOWN AND FELICITY
THE SON OF THE SULTAN NOW WHEN MARZAWAN HEARD THE NAME OF KAMAR AL ZAMAN HE KNEW THAT THIS WAS HE WHOM HE HAD HEARD SPOKEN OF IN SUNDRY CITIES
AND WENT IN TO HIS OWN MOTHER AND TOLD HER WHAT HAD PASSED REVILING AND REPROACHING HER AND SAYING EACH ONE OF YOU IS VILER THAN THE OTHER
FOR INDEED ALL HIS TROUBLES AND AFFLICTIONS WERE BLOTTED OUT FROM HIM AND HE FORGOT HIS FATHER KING SHAHRIMAN AND HIS FORMER ESTATE OF HONOUR AND FAVOUR WITH HIM
AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DA AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOURTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING
NOT SO BY ALLAH TIS EVEN AS SAITH THE POET QUOTH THEY
AND SNORTING AND PUFFING AND NEIGHING AND WAXING FIERCE AND FURIOUS NOW THERE HAPPENED TO BE IN THIS THICKET A LION OF TERRIBLE MIGHT HIDEOUS TO SIGHT WITH EYES SPARKLING LIGHT HIS LOOK WAS GRIM AND HIS ASPECT STRUCK FRIGHT INTO MAN'S SPRITE
NE'ER WITH BEND AND WAVE SHALL FASCINATE THE RAVISHT GAZER'S EYE
FOR HE WAS WRATH BEYOND ALL MEASURE OF WRATH HE CURSED FALSE WOMEN AND SPRANG UP AND DRAWING HIS SWORD SMOTE THE OLD TROT ON THE NECK AND CUT OFF HER PATE THEREUPON HE WENT IN TO HIS MOTHER QUEEN HAYAT AL NUFUS WHOM HE FOUND LYING ON HER BED IN FEEBLE CASE
WHEN IT WAS THE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIFTH NIGHT SHE SAID
IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SHE GAVE HER MISSIVE TO THE EUNUCH IN WAITING AND BADE HIM BEAR IT TO PRINCE AMJAD AND THAT EUNUCH WENT FORTH IGNORING WHAT THE FUTURE HID FOR HIM FOR THE OMNISCIENT ORDERETH EVENTS EVEN AS HE WILLETH AND GOING IN TO THE PRINCE
MY SIN ANENT THE WORLD WHICH I ABHOR
BUT BY LAND IT IS SIX MONTHS MARCH SO HE WENT DOWN TO THE SEA IN A SHIP WHICH WAS BOUND FOR THE KHALIDAN ISLES AND SHE SAILED WITH A FAVOURING BREEZE FOR A WHOLE MONTH TILL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE CAPITAL
AND WHEN IT WAS TIME SHE AROSE AND SOUGHT HER SON MARZAWAN AND ATTIRED HIM IN WOMAN'S APPAREL THEN TAKING HIS HAND IN HERS LED HIM TOWARDS THE PALACE
AND BOTH EXCEEDING SICK AND WEAK
WHEN HE HALTED IN A WASTE AND DESOLATE PLACE AND DISMOUNTING FROM HIS MARE LET DOWN THE TWO CHESTS FROM THE MULE'S BACK
I HAVE SLAIN MY SONS UNJUSTLY AND HE BUFFETED HIS FACE CRYING OUT ALAS MY SONS ALAS MY LONG GRIEF THEN HE BADE THEM BUILD TWO TOMBS IN ONE HOUSE
AND MEET THOU MORE THAN THOU HAST MET AND CUT ALL CHAINS OF WORLD LOVE AND DESIRE AND SAVE THY SOUL AND RISE TO SECRETS HIGHER
AND I DESIRE OF THY FAVOUR THAT MY DAUGHTER MAY GO IN TO HER FOR AN HOUR AND LOOK ON HER AND THEN RETURN WHENCE SHE CAME SO SHALL NONE KNOW OF IT
AND ALLAH PROLONG THE LIFE OF THEE AND PRESERVE THEE FROM ALL INFIRMITY AND AFTER THESE CADENCES SHE WROTE THESE COUPLETS FATE HATH COMMANDED I BECOME THY FERE
WE SEEK REFUGE WITH GOD FROM THE ARTIFICE OF THE DEVILS THEY ARE THE SOURCE OF ALL THE MISFORTUNES THAT HAVE APPEARED AMONG MANKIND IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD
BY ALLAH O MY BROTHER YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS SITTING UPON THE SEAT OF JUDGEMENT
O MY BROTHER BE PATIENT AND THE RELIEF OF ALLAH EXTOLLED AND EXALTED BE HE SHALL ASSUREDLY COME TO US FOR THE HORSE STARTED NOT AWAY SAVE OF HIS FAVOUR TOWARDS US AND NAUGHT IRKETH US BUT THIS THIRST
WHEN IT WAS THE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE KING FARED FORTH TO SPORT AND HUNT BIDDING HIS TWO SONS SIT TO DO JUSTICE IN HIS STEAD EACH ONE DAY BY TURN AS WAS THEIR WONT
AND ON HIS ROAD HE MET THEM COMING OUT OF THE PALACE VESTIBULE FOR THEY HAD DONNED THEIR BEST CLOTHES AND THEIR RICHEST
BY ALLAH O MY BROTHER NONE SHALL GO DOWN INTO THAT CITY SAVE MYSELF AND MAY I BE THY RANSOM IF THOU LEAVE ME ALONE BE IT ONLY FOR AN HOUR
WHEN HE PULLED OFF HIS WET CLOTHES AND CLAD HIM IN A FRESH SUIT COVERING HIS HEAD WITH ONE OF HIS SERVANTS TURBANDS AFTER WHICH HE SAID TO HIM KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN THE MEANS OF SAVING THEE FROM DROWNING DO NOT THOU REQUITE ME BY CAUSING MY DEATH
IT IS INDEED HARD TO ME TO SLAY YOU
HOW OFT I CRY FOR ABSENCE AND DESIRE AH GRIEF BUT ALL MY CRYING NAUGHT OF GAIN FOR ME SHALL GAIN
MAY THE MAN NEVER BE WHO WOULD KILL YOU INDEED WITH MY VERY LIFE I WILL RANSOM YOU
O SHINING LIKE FULL MOON WHEN CLEAREST CLEAR ALL BEAUTY DOST EMBRACE ALL ELOQUENCE BRIGHTER THAN AUGHT WITHIN OUR WORLDLY SPHERE CONTENT AM I MY TORTURER THOU BE
BADE DRAW UP THE CONTRACT OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN KAMAR AL ZAMAN AND HIS DAUGHTER THE PRINCESS HAYAT AL NUFUS
ON RECEIVING THE KERCHIEF HE OPENED IT AND READING THE EPISTLE AND RECOGNIZING ITS GIST HE WAS WARE THAT HIS FATHER'S WIFE WAS ESSENTIALLY AN ADULTERESS
THUS HE ABODE A LONG WHILE ORDERING HIMSELF WORTHILY TOWARDS HIS LIEGES AND HE LIVED WITH HIS TWO WIVES IN PEACE HAPPINESS CONSTANCY AND CONTENT LYING THE NIGHT WITH EACH OF THEM IN TURN HE CEASED NOT AFTER THIS FASHION DURING MANY YEARS
NO LETTER COULD CONTAIN IT NOR CALCULATION COULD COMPASS IT INDEED EARTH AND HEAVEN UPON ME ARE STRAIT AND I HAVE NO HOPE AND NO TRUST BUT WHAT FROM THEE I AWAIT UPON DEATH I AM COME NIGH
THERE CAME OUT ON THEM A TEMPESTUOUS WIND WHICH CARRIED AWAY THE MASTS AND RENT THE CANVAS SO THAT THE SAILS FELL INTO THE SEA AND THE SHIP CAPSIZED WITH ALL ON BOARD AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
AND WHEN HE AWOKE ON THE MORROW HE FANCIED THAT DURING THE NIGHT HE HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM SLEEP AND HAD SEEN BY HIS SIDE A YOUNG LADY OF PASSING LOVELINESS WHOSE CHARMS TONGUE CAN NEVER EXPRESS
WHEN AS'AD HAD READ THE PAPER AND KNEW ITS PURPORT HE WRAPPED IT UP AGAIN IN THE RIBBONS AND PUT IT IN HIS BOSOM POCKET
AND HE ASSURED US THAT HE HAD PLUCKED OFF HER SEAL RING FROM HER FINGER AND HAD PUT IT ON HIS OWN AND THAT SHE HAD DONE LIKEWISE BUT WE KNOW NOT THE SECRET OF ALL THIS BUSINESS SO BY ALLAH O MY SON WHEN THOU COMEST UP WITH ME INTO THE PALACE LOOK NOT ON THE PRINCE
THOSE LONG LASHED EYELIDS RAIN ON ME THEIR SHAFTS GUILEFUL DESTROYING HEARTS WHERE'ER THEY LIGHT NOW WHILE MY PORTION IN THE WORLD ENDURES SHALL I BEHOLD HIM ERE I QUIT WORLD SITE WHAT BEAR I FOR HIS SAKE I'D HIDE
HAPLY IF THOU RESCUE THIS DROWNING MAN HE WILL COME TO KNOW OUR AFFAIRS
JUDGING AND ADMINISTERING JUSTICE APPOINTING AND DEPOSING BIDDING AND FORBIDDING GIVING AND BESTOWING AND HE CEASED NOT THUS TILL NEAR THE TIME OF AFTERNOON PRAYER
THEREUPON THE PRINCESS LOOKED AT HER HAND AND FINDING KAMAR AL ZAMAN'S SEAL RING ON HER FINGER IN STEAD OF HER OWN SAID TO HER
AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
EXPLAIN ME THIS MATTER REPLIED QUEEN BUDUR O KING OF THE AGE KNOW THAT THESE MANY DAYS PAST THY SON AS'AD HATH BEEN IN THE PERSISTENT HABIT OF SENDING ME LETTERS AND MESSAGES TO SOLICIT ME TO LEWDNESS AND ADULTERY WHILE I STILL FORBADE HIM FROM THIS
AND UNDERSTANDING THE CONTENTS KNEW THAT THE PRINCE HAD BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED AND WRONGOUSLY
AFTER WHICH SHE TOOK TO WEEPING AND WAILING AND SAID EXCEPT THOU DO ME JUSTICE ON HIM I WILL TELL MY FATHER KING ARMANUS THEN BOTH WOMEN WEPT WITH SORE WEEPING BEFORE KING KAMAR AL ZAMAN WHO
WHICH HE STYLED HOUSE OF LAMENTATIONS AND HAD GRAVED THEREON HIS SONS NAMES
O MY BROTHER I CAN WALK NO FARTHER
AND OF EXCELLING GRACE PROUD OF THE FACE MOON BRIGHT AND THE BROW FLOWER WHITE AND DAZZLING SPLENDID LIGHT THIS IS MY LETTER TO HIM WHOSE LOVE MELTETH MY BODY AND RENDETH MY SKIN AND BONES
AND THE CAUSE OF MY MADNESS THEN SHE POURED FORTH TEARS AND REPEATED THESE COUPLETS NOW LOVE HAST BANISHED ALL THAT BRED DELIGHT WITH THAT HEART NIBBLING FAWN MY JOYS TOOK FLIGHT
MADE HIM A PRESENT AND SAID TO HIM I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO WAS BROUGHT UP WITH THY MISTRESS AND SINCE THEN I MARRIED HER AND WHEN THAT BEFEL THE PRINCESS WHICH BEFEL HER SHE BECAME TROUBLED AND SORE CONCERNED
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN BEING RAVISHED BY THEIR CHARMS THEY GREW UP SIDE BY SIDE TILL THEY REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN EATING AND DRINKING TOGETHER AND SLEEPING IN ONE BED NOR EVER PARTING AT ANY TIME OR TIDE
BUT I WILL GO ROUND ABOUT ALL LANDS AND WILL SEEK FOR WHAT MAY HEAL THEE HAPLY ALLAH SHALL APPOINT THY HEALING TO BE AT MY HAND MEANWHILE TAKE PATIENCE AND BE NOT DISQUIETED
SUCH WAS HIS CASE
IT WERE BEST THAT I EMBRACE THEE AND THOU EMBRACE ME SO THE SWORD MAY FALL UPON US AND SLAY US BOTH AT A SINGLE STROKE THEREUPON THEY EMBRACED FACE TO FACE AND CLUNG TO EACH OTHER STRAITLY WHILST THE TREASURER TIED UP THE TWAIN AND BOUND THEM FAST WITH CORDS WEEPING THE WHILE
BIDDING AND FORBIDDING APPOINTING AND DEPOSING GIVING AND REFUSING
AND HOW SO AND THE WAZIR ANSWERED
THEREUPON MARZAWAN FAREWELLED HER PRAYING THAT SHE MIGHT BE CONSTANT AND LEFT HER REPEATING THESE COUPLETS THINE IMAGE EVER COMPANIES MY SPRITE
IT IS ON THE ISLANDS OF KHALIDAN
IN RESPECTFUL BEARING AND IN THE PERFECTION OF TRAINING AND THEY WERE INSTRUCTED IN PENMANSHIP AND SCIENCE AND THE ARTS OF GOVERNMENT AND HORSEMANSHIP TILL THEY ATTAINED THE EXTREME ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE UTMOST LIMIT OF BEAUTY AND LOVELINESS
DO THOU ANSWER VERILY THY SONS SALUTE THEE AND SAY TO THEE THOU KNEWEST NOT IF WE WERE INNOCENT OR GUILTY YET HAST THOU PUT US TO DEATH AND HAST NOT CERTIFIED THYSELF OF OUR SIN NOR LOOKED INTO OUR CASE
WE DESIRE OF THEE NAUGHT BUT THAT THOU REPEAT TO OUR SIRE THESE TWO COUPLETS
THIS MAY NOT BE EXCEPT BY NIGHT AFTER THE KING HATH VISITED HIS CHILD AND GONE AWAY THEN COME THOU AND THY DAUGHTER SO SHE KISSED THE EUNUCH'S HAND AND RETURNING HOME WAITED TILL THE MORROW AT NIGHTFALL
O THOU TO WHOM SAD TREMBLING WIGHTS IN FEAR COMPLAIN O EVER READY WHATSO COMETH TO SUSTAIN THE SOLE RESOURCE FOR ME IS AT THY DOOR TO KNOCK
FOR I CANNOT BROOK SHINE ABSENCE FROM ME
BUT HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE EXCLAMATION LOOK THERE WHICH BURST FROM SEVERAL VOICES AT ONCE
CUT A ROPE AND LEAP BACK AGAIN BEFORE THE SOLDIER WHO HELD IT COULD USE HIS WEAPON WOULD BE AN AMUSING AND DEXTEROUS PIECE OF MISCHIEF AND NOW WHEN THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO HOOT AND JOSTLE MORE VIGOROUSLY LOLLO FELT THAT HIS MOMENT WAS COME HE WAS CLOSE TO THE ELDEST PRISONER IN AN INSTANT HE HAD CUT THE CORD
AND ON THE LEFT HAND OF THE FRENCHMAN WAS A FIGURE THAT WAS NOT TO BE ECLIPSED BY ANY AMOUNT OF INTENTION OR BROCADE A FIGURE WE HAVE OFTEN SEEN BEFORE HE WORE NOTHING BUT BLACK FOR HE WAS IN MOURNING
THERE'S NO DANGER FROM YOUR FRENCH SOLDIER HE HAS BEEN SENT OFF BALDASSARRE NODDED AND TURNED IN SILENT ACCEPTANCE OF THE OFFER AND HE AND PIERO LEFT THE CHURCH TOGETHER
ARTISTS WROUGHT TO A NEW AND HIGHER AMBITION BY THE TEACHING OF SAVONAROLA LIKE THAT YOUNG PAINTER WHO HAD LATELY SURPASSED HIMSELF IN HIS FRESCO OF THE DIVINE CHILD ON THE WALL OF THE FRATE'S BARE CELL
NO PREACHER EVER HAD MORE HETEROGENEOUS MATERIALS TO WORK UPON AND ONE SECRET OF THE MASSIVE INFLUENCE LAY IN THE HIGHLY MIXED CHARACTER OF HIS PREACHING BALDASSARRE WROUGHT INTO AN ECSTASY OF SELF MARTYRING REVENGE
FAMOUS RESORT OF ALL FLORENTINES WHO CARED FOR CURIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL IRON WORK WHAT MAKES THE GIANT AT WORK SO LATE THOUGHT TITO BUT SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR ME I CAN DO THAT LITTLE BIT OF BUSINESS TO NIGHT INSTEAD OF TO MORROW MORNING
THE PRISONER'S SENSATIONS WERE NOT TOO SLOW FOR HIM TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY
WHEN PRESENTLY THE OLD COW LOWED NOTE ONE
A FINE CONTRAST TO MY BLAND AND SMILING MESSER GRECO MY BACCO TRIONFANTE WHO HAS MARRIED THE FAIR ANTIGONE IN CONTRADICTION TO ALL HISTORY AND FITNESS AHA HIS SCHOLAR'S BLOOD CURDLED UNCOMFORTABLY AT THE OLD FELLOW'S CLUTCH
IN THE MIDST OF HIS YELLOW BLOODLESS DEEP WRINKLED FACE WITH ITS LANK GREY HAIRS AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING FITFUL IN THE EYES WHICH CONTRADICTED THE OCCASIONAL FLASH OF ENERGY AFTER LOOKING ROUND WITH QUICK FIERCENESS AT WINDOWS AND FACES THEY FELL AGAIN WITH A LOST AND WANDERING LOOK
WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY CHOKED UP AND BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE A MAKESHIFT COURSE THROUGH THE BACK STREETS SO AS TO MEET THE KING AT THE CATHEDRAL ONLY ALSO IF THE YOUNG MONARCH UNDER THE CANOPY SEATED ON HIS CHARGER WITH HIS LANCE UPON HIS THIGH
HALF HUMILIATED EXPRESSION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WITHIN HEARING OF THE JOKE WHICH IS PRODUCING INFECTIOUS LAUGHTER IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL MOMENT FOR TITO FOR HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO COULD HAVE MADE SO AMUSING AN INTERPRETER
TWO SLIGHTER EBONY FIGURES ONE AT THE ANVIL THE OTHER AT THE BELLOWS SERVED TO SET OFF HIS SUPERIOR MASSIVENESS
HE HARDLY KNEW HOW THE WORDS HAD COME TO HIS LIPS
IT'S TRUE AND THE LASSES PEPPERED A FEW STONES DOWN TO FRIGHTEN THEM
AND MAY NOT KNOW HOW HOSPITABLE WE FLORENTINES ARE TO VISITORS WITH TORN DOUBLETS AND EMPTY STOMACHS THERE'S AN HOSPITAL FOR POOR TRAVELLERS OUTSIDE ALL OUR GATES
ATTRACTING THE EARS OF CURIOSITY AND MALICE AS WELL AS OF FAITH THE MEN OF IDEAS LIKE YOUNG NICCOLO MACCHIAVELLI WENT TO OBSERVE AND WRITE REPORTS TO FRIENDS AWAY IN COUNTRY VILLAS THE MEN OF APPETITES LIKE DOLFO SPINI
CONSCIOUS OF PURSES THREATENED BY WAR TAXES AND MORE STRIKING AND VARIOUS PERHAPS THAN ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE FRATE'S DISCIPLES THERE WAS THE LONG STREAM OF POORER TRADESMEN AND ARTISANS WHOSE FAITH AND HOPE IN HIS DIVINE MESSAGE VARIED FROM THE RUDE AND UNDISCRIMINATING TRUST IN HIM
SO THAT MEN COULD WALK ALONG NO LESS SECURELY AND COMMODIOUSLY THAN BY DAY FU GRAN MAGNIFICENZA ALONG THOSE ILLUMINATED STREETS TITO MELEMA WAS WALKING AT ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING ON HIS WAY HOMEWARD
VERY MUCH GRATIFIED BY AN IMMEDIATE DIVINE AUTHORITY FOR BRINGING ABOUT FREEDOM IN THEIR OWN WAY OTHERS LIKE SODERINI WITH LESS OF THE ARDENT PIAGNONE AND MORE OF THE WISE POLITICIAN THERE WERE MEN ALSO OF FAMILY LIKE PIERO CAPPONI
WHEN PIERO RE ENTERED THE PIAZZA DEL DUOMO THE MULTITUDE WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING TO FRA GIROLAMO WERE POURING OUT FROM ALL THE DOORS AND THE HASTE THEY MADE TO GO ON THEIR SEVERAL WAYS WAS A PROOF HOW IMPORTANT THEY HELD THE PREACHING WHICH HAD DETAINED THEM FROM THE OTHER OCCUPATIONS OF THE DAY
THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE IN THE NARROW PASSES OF THE MOUNTAINS AS IN OUR STREETS AND PEASANTS HAVE DESTROYED THE FINEST ARMIES OF OUR CONDOTTIERI IN TIME PAST WHEN THEY HAD ONCE GOT THEM BETWEEN STEEP PRECIPICES I TELL YOU FLORENTINES NEED BE AFRAID OF NO ARMY IN THEIR OWN STREETS
WERE REASONS WHY THE PREACHING IN THE DUOMO COULD LEAST OF ALL BE DISPENSED WITH BUT NOT ALL THE FEET IN THE PIAZZA WERE HASTENING TOWARDS THE STEPS PEOPLE OF HIGH AND LOW DEGREE WERE MOVING TO AND FRO WITH THE BRISK PACE OF MEN WHO HAD ERRANDS BEFORE THEM
WHO HAD JUST PAUSED ON HIS WAY TO THE DUOMO
AS THE FRIEND OF THE POOR AND THE ENEMY OF THE LUXURIOUS OPPRESSIVE RICH TO THAT EAGER TASTING OF ALL THE SUBTLETIES OF BIBLICAL INTERPRETATION
ON THE WAY TO THE GATE OF SANTA CROCE I AM A PAINTER I WOULD GIVE YOU MONEY TO GET YOUR PORTRAIT THE SUSPICION RETURNED INTO BALDASSARRE'S GLANCE AS HE LOOKED AT PIERO AND SAID DECIDEDLY NO AH SAID THE PAINTER CURTLY WELL GO STRAIGHT ON AND YOU'LL FIND THE PORTA SANTA CROCE
IT IS WELL SAID PIERO WITH A SHRUG AND THEY TURNED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER A MYSTERIOUS OLD TIGER THOUGHT THE ARTIST WELL WORTH PAINTING UGLY WITH DEEP LINES
CANOPY WHICH THEY HAD TORN TO PIECES AS THEIR SPOIL ACCORDING TO IMMEMORIAL CUSTOM ROYAL LIPS HAD DULY KISSED THE ALTAR AND AFTER ALL MISCHANCES THE ROYAL PERSON AND RETINUE WERE LODGED IN THE PALACE OF THE VIA LARGA
THE SHEAVES OF BANNERS WERE UNFURLED AT THE ANGLES OF THE BAPTISTERY BUT THERE WAS NO CARPET YET ON THE STEPS OF THE DUOMO
LET HIM COME AND BUY IT HIMSELF THEN SAID NICCOLO BLUNTLY I'M RATHER NICE ABOUT WHAT I SELL AND WHOM I SELL TO I LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S MY CUSTOMER I KNOW YOUR SCRUPLES NICCOLO BUT THAT IS ONLY DEFENSIVE ARMOUR IT CAN HURT NOBODY
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HIS IMPERIOUS NEED OF ASCENDANCY HAD BURNED UNDISCERNIBLY IN THE STRONG FLAME OF HIS ZEAL FOR GOD AND MAN
IT WAS A GRAND MOMENT FOR THOSE WHO WERE STATIONED ON TURRETED ROOFS AND COULD SEE THE LONG WINDING TERRIBLE POMP ON THE BACKGROUND OF THE GREEN HILLS AND VALLEY THERE WAS NO SUNSHINE TO LIGHT UP THE SPLENDOUR OF BANNERS AND SPEARS AND PLUMES AND SILKEN SURCOATS
FOR HE TOO WAS TO WALK IN PROCESSION AS LATIN SECRETARY TO THE TEN TITO MELEMA HAD BECOME CONSPICUOUSLY SERVICEABLE IN THE INTERCOURSE WITH THE FRENCH GUESTS FROM HIS FAMILIARITY WITH SOUTHERN ITALY AND HIS READINESS IN THE FRENCH TONGUE WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN IN HIS EARLY YOUTH
WHO ON A MEMORABLE OCCASION YET TO COME WAS TO RAISE HIS LEARNED ARMS IN STREET STONE THROWING FOR THE CAUSE OF RELIGION FREEDOM AND THE FRATE AND AMONG THE DIGNITIES WHO CARRIED THEIR BLACK LUCCO OR FURRED MANTLE WITH AN AIR OF HABITUAL AUTHORITY
IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THEIR WELFARE THAT HE SHOULD KEEP THE MASTERY THE EFFECT WAS INEVITABLE NO MAN EVER STRUGGLED TO RETAIN POWER OVER A MIXED MULTITUDE WITHOUT SUFFERING VITIATION HIS STANDARD MUST BE THEIR LOWER NEEDS AND NOT HIS OWN BEST INSIGHT
BUT GADDI DISTRUSTING HIS OWN PROMPTNESS HUNG BACK AND PUSHING TITO SAID YOU MELEMA
SIMPLY BRAVE UNDOCTRINAL LOVERS OF A SOBER REPUBLICAN LIBERTY WHO PREFERRED FIGHTING TO ARGUING AND HAD NO PARTICULAR REASONS FOR THINKING ANY IDEAS FALSE THAT KEPT OUT THE MEDICI AND MADE ROOM FOR PUBLIC SPIRIT
AND EVERY FOOL THAT HAS PASSED MY SHOP HAS PUT HIS PUMPKIN HEAD IN TO SAY NICCOLO WILT THOU NOT COME AND SEE THE KING OF FRANCE AND HIS SOLDIERS AND I'VE ANSWERED NO I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEIR FACES I WANT TO SEE THEIR BACKS ARE YOU MAKING ARMS FOR THE CITIZENS THEN NICCOLO
THAT CAME AS NATURALLY TO HIM AS WALKING SAID THE FEW NEEDFUL WORDS IN THE NAME OF THE SIGNORIA THEN GAVE WAY GRACEFULLY AND LET THE KING PASS ON HIS PRESENCE OF MIND WHICH HAD FAILED HIM IN THE TERRIBLE CRISIS OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN A READY INSTRUMENT THIS TIME
AND WITH WHOM THESE HIGHEST DIGNITIES WERE PROMISCUOUSLY THROWN WHEN PRESSED UPON BY THE HORSES SOMEBODY STEP FORWARD AND SAY A FEW WORDS IN FRENCH SAID SODERINI BUT NO ONE OF HIGH IMPORTANCE CHOSE TO RISK A SECOND FAILURE YOU FRANCESCO GADDI YOU CAN SPEAK
AGAINST THE RED LIGHT FRAMED IN BY THE OUTLINE OF THE FLUTED TILES AND COLUMNS STOOD IN BLACK RELIEF THE GRAND FIGURE OF NICCOLO WITH HIS HUGE ARMS IN RHYTHMIC RISE AND FALL FIRST HIDING AND THEN DISCLOSING THE PROFILE OF HIS FIRM MOUTH AND POWERFUL BROW
FOLLOWED BY THE BUTCHER AND ALL THE REST OF HIS COMPANIONS EXCEPT GORO WHO HASTILY RETREATED UP A NARROW PASSAGE THE SIGHT OF THE DYER RUNNING FORWARD WITH BLOOD RED ARMS AND AXE UPLIFTED AND WITH HIS CLUSTER OF ROUGH COMPANIONS BEHIND HIM HAD A STIMULATING EFFECT ON THE CROWD NOT THAT HE DID ANYTHING ELSE
THE LUSTRE OF GOOD FORTUNE WAS UPON HIM HE WAS SMILING LISTENING AND EXPLAINING WITH HIS USUAL GRACEFUL UNPRETENTIOUS EASE AND ONLY A VERY KEEN EYE BENT ON STUDYING HIM COULD HAVE MARKED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CHANGE IN HIM WHICH WAS NOT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE LAPSE OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS
THAT COMPLIANCE HAD GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED AND THE SOLDIERS FOUND THEMSELVES ESCORTED BY A GATHERING TROOP OF MEN AND BOYS
MIGHT EASILY CHECK ANY REBELLIOUS MOVEMENT BY THE THREAT OF THROTTLING THE MEN WHO HELD THE ROPES WERE FRENCH SOLDIERS AND BY BROKEN ITALIAN PHRASES AND STROKES FROM THE KNOTTED END OF THE ROPE THEY FROM TIME TO TIME STIMULATED THEIR PRISONERS TO BEG
WAS ONLY AN EXTREME CASE AMONG THE PARTIAL AND NARROW SYMPATHIES OF THAT AUDIENCE IN SAVONAROLA'S PREACHING THERE WERE STRAINS THAT APPEALED TO THE VERY FINEST SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF MEN'S NATURES AND THERE WERE ELEMENTS THAT GRATIFIED LOW EGOISM
BUT FOR THE MASS OF HIS AUDIENCE ALL THE PREGNANCY OF HIS PREACHING LAY IN HIS STRONG ASSERTION OF SUPERNATURAL CLAIMS IN HIS DENUNCIATORY VISIONS IN THE FALSE CERTITUDE WHICH GAVE HIS SERMONS THE INTEREST OF A POLITICAL BULLETIN AND HAVING ONCE HELD THAT AUDIENCE IN HIS MASTERY IT WAS NECESSARY TO HIS NATURE
THERE WAS AN ABUNDANT SPRINKLING OF MEN WITH MORE CONTEMPLATIVE AND SENSITIVE FACES SCHOLARS INHERITING SUCH HIGH NAMES AS STROZZI AND ACCIAJOLI WHO WERE ALREADY MINDED TO TAKE THE COWL AND JOIN THE COMMUNITY OF SAN MARCO
HAD LOOKED MORE LIKE A CHARLEMAGNE AND LESS LIKE A HASTILY MODELLED GROTESQUE THE IMAGINATION OF HIS ADMIRERS WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH ASSISTED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WISHED THAT THE SCOURGE OF ITALIAN WICKEDNESS AND CHAMPION OF THE HONOUR OF WOMEN HAD HAD A LESS MISERABLE LEG AND ONLY THE NORMAL SUM OF TOES
BENT ON HUNTING DOWN THE FRATE AS A PUBLIC NUISANCE WHO MADE GAME SCARCE WENT TO FEED THEIR HATRED AND LIE IN WAIT FOR GROUNDS OF ACCUSATION PERHAPS WHILE NO PREACHER EVER HAD A MORE MASSIVE INFLUENCE THAN SAVONAROLA
TRUE BUT IT MAY MAKE THE MAN WHO WEARS IT FEEL HIMSELF ALL THE SAFER IF HE SHOULD WANT TO HURT SOMEBODY NO NO IT'S NOT MY OWN WORK BUT IT'S FINE WORK OF MASO OF BRESCIA I SHOULD BE LOTH FOR IT TO COVER THE HEART OF A SCOUNDREL I MUST KNOW WHO IS TO WEAR IT
THAT HIS MOUTH HAD BEEN OF A LESS REPTILIAN WIDTH OF SLIT HIS NOSE AND HEAD OF A LESS EXORBITANT OUTLINE BUT THE THIN LEG RESTED ON CLOTH OF GOLD AND PEARLS AND THE FACE WAS ONLY AN INTERRUPTION OF A FEW SQUARE INCHES IN THE MIDST OF BLACK VELVET AND GOLD
SANTIDDIO HERE'S A SIGHT SAID THE DYER AS SOON AS HE HAD DIVINED THE MEANING OF THE ADVANCING TUMULT AND THE FOOLS DO NOTHING BUT HOOT COME ALONG HE ADDED SNATCHING HIS AXE FROM HIS BELT AND RUNNING TO JOIN THE CROWD
WHO HAD MADE HIMSELF A POWERFUL INSTRUMENT WITH THE PEOPLE AND MUST BE ACCEPTED AS AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL FACT
KNOWING IT WAS USELESS TO TRY PERSUASION THE FACT IS I AM LIKELY TO HAVE A JOURNEY TO TAKE AND YOU KNOW WHAT JOURNEYING IS IN THESE TIMES YOU DON'T SUSPECT ME OF TREASON AGAINST THE REPUBLIC NO I KNOW NO HARM OF YOU SAID NICCOLO IN HIS BLUNT WAY AGAIN
THE CAUSE COULD NOT BE PRECISELY GUESSED FOR THE FRENCH DRESS WAS SCREENED BY THE IMPEDING CROWD
AND I KNEW SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED NO MATTER WHAT SO I THREW MY CLOTH IN AT THE FIRST DOORWAY AND TOOK HOLD OF MY MEAT AXE AND RAN AFTER MY FINE CAVALIERS TOWARDS THE VIGNA NUOVA AND WHAT IS IT GUCCIO SAID I WHEN HE CAME UP WITH ME I THINK IT'S THE MEDICI COMING BACK
AND THE BLAZE OF RUBIES AND THE BRILLIANT TINTS OF THE EMBROIDERED AND BEPEARLED CANOPY FU GRAN MAGNIFICENZA
AND AS HE NEARED THE ANGLE TURNING INTO THE BORGO SANTA CROCE HIS EAR WAS STRUCK BY A MUSIC WHICH WAS NOT THAT OF EVENING REVELRY BUT OF VIGOROUS LABOUR THE MUSIC OF THE ANVIL TITO GAVE A SLIGHT START AND QUICKENED HIS PACE FOR THE SOUNDS HAD SUGGESTED A WELCOME THOUGHT
FU GRAN MAGNIFICENZA BUT FOR THE SIGNORIA WHO HAD BEEN WAITING ON THEIR PLATFORM AGAINST THE GATES AND HAD TO MARCH OUT AT THE RIGHT MOMENT WITH THEIR ORATOR IN FRONT OF THEM TO MEET THE MIGHTY GUEST THE GRANDEUR OF THE SCENE HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT SCREENED BY UNPLEASANT SENSATIONS
SOME IN HALF AUTOMATIC RESPONSE TO AN APPEAL IN THE NAME OF GOD OTHERS IN THAT UNQUESTIONING AWE OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERY WHICH HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE REPORTS OF THEIR CRUEL WARFARE AND ON WHICH THE FRENCH THEMSELVES COUNTED AS A GUARANTEE OF IMMUNITY IN THEIR ACTS OF INSOLENCE
MATERIALS FOR THIS STUDY ARE NOT DIFFICULT OF ACCESS FOREIGN COLORED PHOTOGRAPHS OF NORWEGIAN LANDSCAPE ARE BECOMING COMMON IN OUR ART STORES THERE ARE GOOD ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE
WITH BRIGHT COLORS THESE GAY BUILDINGS WERE CLOSE TOGETHER
AND SEE HOW FAST I CAN RUN THE BIG GREY RAT RAN TO THE END OF THE WALL WHEELED AROUND AND CAME BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE THE LITTLE BEETLE WAS SLOWLY CRAWLING ALONG
THERE WERE NO LARGE WINDOWS IN A FEAST HALL
ONE WOULD BE CALLED HAKI THE BLACK BECAUSE HE HAD BLACK HAIR THE OTHER WOULD BE CALLED HAKI THE SHIP CHESTED BECAUSE HIS CHEST WAS BROAD AND STRONG THESE NICKNAMES WERE OFTEN GIVEN ONLY FOR THE FUN OF IT
AND THERE WERE NO WINDOWS IN IT
I'D LIKE A YELLOW COAT WITH STRIPES LIKE THE TIGER'S SAID THE BIG GREY RAT
THE PUPPY CHEWED MY OTHER GOLLY I FORGOT I SUPPOSE I MUSTN'T USE THIS BUT IT'S MY BIRTHDAY NEXT MONTH AND I WANT STEEN THINGS
THEN SHE LAMMED ME I TELL YOU I RESPECTED HER FOR IT TOO BUT
AT ONCE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MAKE HIM NEED HIS SWORD HE BROKE THE PEACE BANDS AND DREW IT OUT ESKIMOS NOW THE ESKIMOS LIVE IN GREENLAND AND ALASKA AND
AND SO SHUT THEMSELVES IN OLAF'S MEN
I WOULDN'T RATHER LOSE MOTHER THAN HIM BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A STEP MOTHER
HE GAVE THE SIGNAL TO START AND THEN HE FLEW AWAY TO THE ROYAL PALM TREE TO WATCH FOR THE END OF THE RACE THE BIG GREY RAT RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD THEN HE THOUGHT HOW VERY TIRED HE WAS GETTING
OH GOLLY
SHE ALSO CAUGHT ALL THE GOLD AND RICH TREASURES THAT WENT DOWN IN SHIPS SO HER CAVE WAS FILLED WITH SHINING THINGS VALKYRIAS THESE WERE THE MAIDENS OF ODIN
TO DRESS UP FOR PARTIES BUT
WOULDN'T ALICE BE HOPPING
DIDN'T SHE SQUEAL BLOODY MURDER
THESE NORSE STORIES HAVE TO MY THINKING THREE VALUES THE MEN
NECESSARY TO BE DONE BEFORE
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THESE THINGS HAPPENED BEFORE ERIC FOUND GREENLAND IN THAT CASE HE FOUND ESKIMOS THERE AND THORFINN SAW RED INDIANS IN WINELAND
THE STUDY WILL HAVE A GENERAL VALUE THAT WILL CONTINUE PAST THE READING OF THESE STORIES INTO ALL WORK IN GEOGRAPHY TRUSTWORTHY PICTURES OF NORSE HOUSES AND COSTUMES ARE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IN
GEOGRAPHICAL WORKS REFERRED TO IN THE BOOK LIST THESE
GUDRID MEANS GUNNR'S RIDER GUDROD MEANS
THORSTEIN MEANS THOR'S STONE THORKEL MEANS THOR'S FIRE THORBIORN MEANS THOR'S BEAR GUDBRAND MEANS GUNNR'S SWORD
A SLEEPING HOUSE FOR THRALLS
LET ANYBODY ELSE ABUSE
SHE TALKED ABOUT IT SO MUCH THAT FINALLY HER MOTHER TOOK HER TO THE PARROT WHO LIVED
YET ALL THE SAME IT'S TRUE I DISTINCTLY HEARD HIM SAY HE LOVED HER BETTER THAN ANYTHING ON EARTH I DON'T THINK HE
BOTHER ABOUT A GIRL LIKE PEG WHO CAN'T DO ANYTHING
HEARD HIM ASK HER WHAT IS IT DEAR DEAR YOUR GRANDMOTHER SHE SAID THEN WHY WOULDN'T HE LET HER BE ENGAGED TO HIM LIKE ANYBODY ELSE
DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WERE FLAT STONES IN THE DIRT FLOOR HERE THE FIRES BURNED IN THE ROOF ABOVE THESE FIRES WERE HOLES FOR THE SMOKE TO GO OUT
YOU CAN SEE HE'S A JIM DANDY AND
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND I'VE HAD HIM SIX MONTHS
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS POSSIBLY THIS BOOK SEEMS MADE UP OF FOUR OR FIVE DISCONNECTED STORIES THEY ARE HOWEVER STRUNG UPON ONE THREAD THE WESTWARD EMIGRATION FROM NORWAY
YOU MAY CHANGE YOUR COAT FOR A BLUE ONE SAID THE PARROT BUT IF YOU CHANGE YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE UP SOMETHING OH I'LL GLADLY GIVE UP
TO TURN SKALDS AND COMPOSE SONGS IN THE NORSE MANNER THIS REQUIRES ONLY A SMALL VOCABULARY AND A ROUGH FEELING FOR SIMPLE RHYTHM BUT AN INTENSITY OF EMOTION AND A GREAT VIVIDNESS OF IMAGE
OF THE TWO FLOWED TOGETHER AND THEY SAID NOW WE ARE OF ONE BLOOD
HALL AND SET THEM BEFORE THE BENCHES THEN THEY LAID LONG BOARDS ACROSS FROM TRESTLE TO TRESTLE
FIND CONCEALED WINGS YOU HAVE LOST THE PRIZE UNTIL THIS DAY EVEN IN BRAZIL WHERE THE FLOWERS AND BIRDS AND BEASTS AND INSECTS HAVE SUCH GORGEOUS COLOURING THE RAT WEARS A PLAIN DULL GREY COAT
AND JUST TO MAKE THE RACE EXCITING
HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HIS EYES HE THOUGHT HE MUST BE HAVING A BAD DREAM THERE WAS THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE SITTING QUIETLY BESIDE THE BRIGHT GREEN AND GOLD PARROT THE BIG GREY RAT HAD NEVER BEEN SO SURPRISED IN ALL HIS LIFE
MOST OF THE LAND IN OLD NORWAY WAS COVERED WITH FORESTS WHEN A MAN GOT NEW LAND HE HAD TO CLEAR OFF THE TREES IN THOSE OLDEN DAYS A MAN DID NOT HAVE A SURNAME THAT BELONGED TO EVERYONE IN HIS FAMILY
HE LOOKED AWFULLY CUNNING INSIDE THE COLLARS BUT
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT HAVING TO RUN TO WIN THE RACE SHE REPLIED SO I FLEW INSTEAD
A YEAR AGO I WAS FISHING ONE DAY
ON THE VERY NORTHERN SHORES OF CANADA BUT ONCE THEY LIVED FARTHER SOUTH IN PLEASANTER LANDS
LET WELL ENOUGH ALONE AND TRIED TO BE CONTENTED
AND ALL THE GODS TO HEAR MY VOW MAY THEY HATE ME IF I BREAK IT RAN RAN WAS THE WIFE OF AEGIR
TEMPTED AFTER A WHILE TO READ THOSE FINE OLD BOOKS TO ENJOY THE TALES TO APPRECIATE STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS AND SIMPLICITY OF STYLE
ON THE FLOOR OF THIS BOX WAS STRAW WITH BLANKETS THROWN OVER IT
BY J P GAIMARD IF THE LANDSCAPE IS STUDIED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF FORMATION THE IMAGES WILL BE MORE ACCURATE AND MORE EASILY GAINED AND
I'D LIKE A BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT COLOURED NEW COAT TOO SAID THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE THE BIG GREY RAT LAUGHED LONG AND LOUD UNTIL HIS GAUNT GREY SIDES WERE SHAKING WHY
I WILL FIGHT FOR MY FOSTER BROTHER WHENEVER HE SHALL NEED ME IF HE IS KILLED BEFORE I AM I WILL PUNISH THE MAN WHO DID IT WHATEVER THINGS I OWN ARE AS MUCH MY FOSTER BROTHER'S AS MINE
RAN OUT OF A HOLE IN THE WALL AND LOOKED DOWN SCORNFULLY AT THE LITTLE BEETLE O HO HE SAID TO THE BEETLE HOW SLOWLY YOU CRAWL ALONG YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD JUST LOOK AT ME
MOST MEN HAD THEM ERIC THE RED LEIF THE LUCKY HARALD HAIRFAIR ROLF GO AFOOT THE OTHER WAY OF KNOWING
TURNED TO THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE WHO WAS WAITING QUIETLY AT HIS SIDE WHAT COLOUR DO YOU WANT YOUR NEW COAT TO BE HE ASKED THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE LOOKED UP AT THE BRIGHT GREEN AND GOLD PARROT AT THE GREEN AND GOLD PALM TREES ABOVE THEIR HEADS
TABLES BEFORE A MEAL THRALLS
THESE TWO POINTS THE ISLAND CONNECTION THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE LONG VOYAGE FROM NORWAY TO AMERICA AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF STORM TO DISCOVERY I HAVE STATED IN THE BOOK ONLY DRAMATICALLY
THAT THIS HAPPENED AFTER ERIC WENT TO GREENLAND
IT WAS HIS DUTY TO TAKE CARE OF HER AND NOT ALLOW HER TO MAKE A MISTAKE THAT MIGHT RUIN HER LIFE
TO BE CALLED AFTER A
I'D WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING THAT I KNEW ABOUT PEGGY AND HARRY GOWARD AND ALL THAT STUFF SHE'D HAVE SALLY MAKE ME THREE POUNDS OF CRUMBLY COOKIES WITH CURRANTS ON TOP IN A BOX
FOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED WAS THE THICK OUTSIDE WALL
DON'T YOU WISH THAT YOU COULD RUN LIKE THAT
IF YOU SPEAK THESE NAMES QUICKLY THEY SOUND LIKE HAKI ERICSSON
THE BLUE BEETLES COATS HAVE NOT BEEN HARD AND FIRM THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE JEWELLERS HAVE DIFFICULTY
A NORSE FATHER SENT HIS CHILDREN AWAY FROM HOME TO GROW UP THEY WENT WHEN THEY WERE THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD AND STAYED UNTIL THEY WERE GROWN THE FATHER THOUGHT
VIKING AGE AND STORY OF NORWAY BY BOYESEN G P PUTNAM'S SONS NEW YORK ARE MANY COPIES OF NORSE ANTIQUITIES IN THE FASHION OF WEAPONS SHIELD BOSSES
THAT A REALLY POLITE BEETLE NEVER BOASTS ABOUT HER OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS THE LITTLE BROWN BEETLE NEVER BOASTED A SINGLE BOAST
THAT THE ESKIMOS HAD SO THEY FOUGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH THOSE PEOPLE AND
KNOW A WHACKING SECRET THAT THEY'D ALL BE EXCITED ABOUT WOULD MAKE HER MAD ENOUGH TO
IN BRAZIL THE BEETLES HAVE SUCH BEAUTIFULLY COLOURED HARD SHELLED COATS UPON THEIR BACKS THAT THEY ARE OFTEN SET IN PINS AND NECKLACES LIKE PRECIOUS STONES ONCE UPON A TIME YEARS AND YEARS AGO
UPON THE BLUE CIRCLE THEY PLACED STARS OF SILVERY WHITE LIKE THE SILVERY WHITE LIGHTS ON THE BACK OF THE BLUE BEETLE ABOUT THE BLUE CIRCLE OF THE EARTH
SOMETIMES DURING THE FIGHT A MAN WOULD THINK THAT HE SAW THE VALKYRIAS
OF THE DANGERS OF THE SEA AND A CONSEQUENT REALIZATION OF
SHE'D HAD SALLY MAKE FOR ME TO ENTIRELY EAT BY MYSELF AND
A LITTLE AND THEY DIDN'T EITHER OF THEM SAY ANYTHING FOR A WHILE BUT THERE WERE SOFT RUSTLING SOUNDS A TROUT WAS AFTER MY BAIT SO I DIDN'T
BURST SHE THINKS SHE CAN READ MY INGROWN SOUL TOO BUT I RATHER THINK I HAVE MY OWN INTERIOR THOUGHTS THAT MISS ALICE DOESN'T TUMBLE TO FOR INSTANCE DOCTOR DENBIGH
THE HEAD OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT WHO PLANNED THIS COURSE SAYS IT IS IN A SENSE A DRAMATIZATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE FOLLOWING IS A BARE TOPICAL OUTLINE OF THE WORK EVOLUTION
GREEN AND GOLD ONE SAID THE DISCONTENTED LITTLE BEETLE WHEN SHE RECEIVED HER NEW COAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL
AN OLD NORSE STORY SAYS
SOMETIMES THERE WERE TWO OR THREE MEN OF THE SAME NAME IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT CAUSED TROUBLE PEOPLE THOUGHT OF TWO WAYS OF MAKING IT EASY TO TELL WHICH MAN WAS BEING SPOKEN OF EACH WAS GIVEN A NICKNAME SUPPOSE
AGAIN IN FORM AND IN MATTER OLD NORSE LITERATURE IS WELL WORTH OUR READING I SHOULD DEEM IT A GREAT THING ACCOMPLISHED IF THE CHILDREN WHO READ THESE STORIES
IT WAS THE EASTER VACATION AND HOW SHE WAS ONLY A STUPID GIRL AND
NEVER FORGET HER ONE MINUTE ALL HIS LIFE
OF THEIR LIVES FOR THE PRESENT BOOK THE FOLLOWING CLAIMS MAY BE MADE FIRST IT IS A MODERN BOOK ITS WRITER WATCHES HOUR BY HOUR THE NEW ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE HUMAN MIND
IF YOU OBEY HIS LAWS IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL TRY TO FIND OUT ABOUT HIS LAWS AND YOU WILL BE COMPARATIVELY LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF YOUR BUSINESS PERHAPS ON THE OTHER HAND
THE FIRST IS NOT ENTIRELY COMPETENT THE SECOND IS NOT ENTIRELY HONEST AND THE THIRD IS NOT ENTIRELY UP TO DATE NOR IS THERE ANYWHERE A BOOK IN WHICH THE EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO GIVE TO
AND TURNED OVER THE CARE OF HIS DOMESTIC LIFE TO A PRIEST IS IT NOT OBVIOUS THAT THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF SUCH PROBLEMS LIES IN DIVORCE UNLESS INDEED
THEY ARE IN EVERY RANK OF LIFE AND ARE JUST AS DEFINITELY AND CERTAINLY MENACES TO HUMAN WELFARE AND PROGRESS AS PIRATES ON THE HIGH SEAS OR HIGHWAYMEN ON THE ROAD NOR ARE THEY CONFINED TO THE MALES
WHAT INTEREST HAS SOCIETY IN THE RESTRICTION OF DIVORCE WHAT AFFAIR IS IT OF ANY OTHER PERSON IF I CHOOSE TO GET A DIVORCE AND MARRY A NEW WIFE ONCE A MONTH THERE ARE MANY REASONS
MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CAMPAIGN FUNDS OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY I DO NOT MEAN BY THIS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD GET A DIVORCE AS SOON AS THEY FIND THEY DIFFER ABOUT SOME INTELLECTUAL IDEA ON THE CONTRARY
AND FUNDAMENTAL NATURE THE TROUBLE WITH THIS LAST PLAN IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR IDEAS ON LIFE MADE UP IN TABLOID FORM THEY HAVE CREEDS AND CATECHISMS WHICH THEY KNOW BY HEART
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY TO THE RIGHT OR THE CLAIM TO THE RIGHT ON THE PART OF A MAN OR WOMAN TO BE MARRIED ONCE A YEAR THROUGHOUT A LIFETIME IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THIS PROBLEM I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT A CERTAIN MAN KNOWN TO ME
MUST THEY NOT SOMETIMES LOSE THE POWER TO MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY IN THE MARITAL BONDS WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE MAN WHO MASTERS LIFE AND BECOMES A VITAL FORCE WHILE HIS WIFE REMAINS DULL AND EMPTY
BUT I THINK WE MIGHT BEGIN BY REFUSING TO LET ANY MAN OR WOMAN HAVE MORE THAN TWO DIVORCES IN ONE LIFETIME IN ANY STATE OR PART OF THE WORLD
THIS PARTICULAR MAN HAPPENS TO CALL HIMSELF A RADICAL BUT I COULD TELL YOU OF SIMILAR MEN IN THE HIGHEST SOCIAL CIRCLES OR IN THE POLITICAL WORLD THE THEATRICAL WORLD THE SPORTING WORLD
AN AGNOSTIC WHOSE WIFE A HALF EDUCATED SENTIMENTAL WOMAN TOOK TO DABBLING IN MYSTICISM
THE TWO WOMEN IN THE CASE WERE NOT INTIMATE I GATHERED BUT THEY FREQUENTLY MET AT THE HOMES OF OTHERS
A LARGE ORDER AS THE BOYS PHRASE IT THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS FOR SUCH A BOOK TO BEGIN IT MIGHT BEGIN WITH THE CHILD BECAUSE WE ALL BEGIN THAT WAY IT MIGHT BEGIN WITH LOVE BECAUSE THAT PRECEDES THE CHILD
WHO WATCHES YOU DAY AND NIGHT AND KNOWS EVERY THOUGHT YOU THINK
AND HEARD HIM USE ALMOST THE IDENTICAL WORDS IT IS NOT ONLY IN THE CLASS ROOM AND THE SCHOOLS THAT THE MINDS OF MEN ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS IN FACT IT WAS NOT FROM THE SCHOOLS
WE MAKE NEW BODIES OF CHILDREN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY WHO HAVE YET ROMPED ON THE EARTH AND IN THE SAME WAY BY PUTTING MINDS AND SOULS TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE NEW KINDS OF MINDS AND SOULS
IS AN EVIL PER SE AND REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES THEY KNOW THIS BECAUSE GOD HAS TOLD THEM SO AND IN THE NAME OF GOD THEY SEEK TO KEEP PEOPLE TIED IN SEX UNIONS
HOW GENIUS MULTIPLIES TO INFINITY THE JOY AND POWER OF LIFE BY MEANS OF THE ARTS AND ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE ARTS IS THE ART OF LOVE CONSIDER THE GREAT LOVERS THE TRUE LOVERS OF HISTORY
FROM ROBERT AND ELIZABETH BROWNING FROM TRISTAN AND ISOLDE FROM ROMEO AND JULIET WHAT IS THE DEPTH AND THE SPLENDOR OF THIS PASSION WHICH LIES HIDDEN WITHIN US
YOU CANNOT CHANGE HUMAN NATURE I DO NOT THINK I AM INDULGING EITHER IN RELIGIOUS SUPERSTITION OR IN BLIND OPTIMISM BUT AM SPEAKING PRECISELY
THE AMERICAN PERFECT LADY SHE DOES MOST OF THE READING FOR THE FAMILY BUT SHE HAS NEVER GOT DOWN TO ANYTHING FUNDAMENTAL IN HER LIFE AND MOSTLY SHE LIKES TO READ ABOUT EXCITING LOVE AFFAIRS
MISSUS WHARTON WILL I FEAR CONSIDER ME A VERY VULGAR PERSON IF I ASSERT THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHATEVER WHY ANY OF THOSE FOUR PEOPLE IN HER STORY SHOULD HAVE HAD A MOMENT'S DISCOMFORT OF MIND
SHALL WE BE REWARDED IF WE THINK RIGHT AND WILL THE PAY BE WORTH THE TROUBLE SUCH QUESTIONS AS THESE I AM GOING TO TRY TO ANSWER IN THE SIMPLEST LANGUAGE POSSIBLE
OR WILL WE BE ONLY GUESSING CAN WE TRUST OURSELVES TO THINK ABOUT THEM OR SHALL WE BE SAFER IF WE BELIEVE WHAT WE ARE TOLD SHALL WE BE PUNISHED IF WE THINK WRONG AND HOW SHALL WE BE PUNISHED
HAS SHOWN US THAT WE CAN CHANGE PLANT NATURE THERE FLASH BACK UPON MY MEMORY ALL THOSE DULL WEARY SICK HUMAN CREATURES WHO HAVE REPEATED TO ME THAT DULL WEARY SICK OLD FORMULA
SECOND THERE ARE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF WHICH EVERY MARRIAGE IS A TANGLE AND THE SETTLEMENT OF WHICH THE LAW SHOULD ALWAYS OVERSEE THIRD
THERE IS IN SUCCESSFUL OPERATION IN SWITZERLAND A WISE AND SANE DIVORCE LAW BASED UPON COMMON SENSE AND NOT UPON SUPERSTITION A COUPLE WISH TO BREAK THEIR MARRIAGE AND THEY GO BEFORE A JUDGE
TO KNOW A LITTLE OF WHAT THE WISE MEN OF THE PAST HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THEM AND MORE ESPECIALLY WHAT SCIENCE WITH ITS NEW TOOLS OF KNOWLEDGE MAY HAVE DISCOVERED THE WRITER OF THIS BOOK SPENT NINE YEARS OF HIS LIFE IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
WHICH HAVE COME TO MEAN LOATHING INSTEAD OF LOVE NOW I WILL ASSERT IT AS A MATHEMATICAL CERTAINTY THAT A CONSIDERABLE PERCENTAGE OF MARRIAGES MUST FAIL IT IS ESSENTIAL TO PROGRESS
FOR TEN YEARS OR SO I USED TO SEE HIM ABOUT ONCE IN SIX MONTHS AND INVARIABLY HE HAD A NEW WOMAN A YOUNG GIRL OF FINE CHARACTER WHO HAD BEEN ENSNARED BY HIM AND WAS IN THE AGONIZING PROCESS
BUT SOME OF THESE LONG WORDS MEAN CERTAIN DEFINITE THINGS AND THERE ARE NO OTHER WORDS TO SERVE THE PURPOSE
IN HIS EARLY LIFE HE SPENT A COUPLE OF YEARS IN A LUNATIC ASYLUM HE LAYS CLAIM TO EXTRAORDINARY SPIRITUAL GIFTS AND USES THE LANGUAGE OF THE HIGHEST IDEALISM KNOWN HE IS A MAN OF CULTURE AND GOOD FAMILY
NOT IN ANY WAY BASED UPON RELIGIOUS SUPERSTITION OR CONVENTIONAL PREJUDICE IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE OR MAY BE CHILDREN AND SOCIETY SHOULD TRY TO PRESERVE FOR EVERY CHILD A HOME WITH A FATHER AND A MOTHER IN IT
FOR THE PROMOTION OF FORNICATION AND PROSTITUTION THERE IS A SHORT STORY BY EDITH WHARTON IN WHICH THE DIVORCE EVIL
AND THUS EXERTS A PECULIAR CHARM UPON YOUNG WOMEN OF REFINEMENT AND SENSITIVENESS TO MY KNOWLEDGE HE WAS THREE TIMES MARRIED IN SIX YEARS AND EACH TIME HE DESERTED THE WOMAN
AND HAS A CHANCE FOR A FEW MINUTES INTIMACY WITH HER HUSBAND BEFORE HE FALLS ASLEEP SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOMEBODY TELL HER WHAT TO DO FOR CROUP BUT SHE IS NOT SURE THAT SHE HAS TIME TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION WHETHER LIFE IS WORTH LIVING
TO PREY UPON THE LOVE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PLACED AT HIS MERCY BY THEIR BEST QUALITIES THEIR UNSELFISHNESS AND LACK OF SUSPICION WE CLEAR OUT FOUL SMELLING WEEDS FROM OUR GARDEN
A MAN IS UNABLE TO MAKE HIS WIFE HAPPY AND CAN I TELL HIM WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH WOMEN A MAN HAS INVESTED HIS SAVINGS IN MINING STOCK AND CAN I TELL HIM WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT
AND IF YOU SUGGEST TO THEM ANYTHING DIFFERENT THEY GIVE YOU A STARTLED LOOK AND GET OUT OF YOUR WAY AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER AND IN OUR MODERN WORLD A STILL LARGER CLASS WHO SAY OH SHUCKS
OR AS TODAY UNDER THE CAPITALIST REGIME WE CAN NOT WITHHOLD OUR SYMPATHY FROM POLITICAL PRISONERS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE COMMITTED ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH WE DEPLORE BUT WHEN WE HAVE MADE SEX LAWS
THERE COME TO THE WRITER LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF LETTERS EVERY YEAR ASKING HIM QUESTIONS SOME OF THEM OF THE STRANGEST A MAN IS DYING OF CANCER AND DO I THINK IT CAN BE CURED BY A FAST
ALL DAY UNDER THE BONUS SYSTEM OR THE PIECE WORK SYSTEM AND IS APT TO FALL ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR BEFORE HE FINISHES SUPPER THEN THERE IS THE WORKINGMAN'S WIFE WHO HAS SLAVED ALL DAY IN THE KITCHEN
THERE IS THE QUESTION OF VENEREAL DISEASE WHICH SOCIETY HAS AN UNQUESTIONABLE RIGHT TO KEEP DOWN BY EVERY REASONABLE RESTRICTION UPON SEXUAL PROMISCUITY AND FINALLY THERE IS THE RESPECT
ITS WRITER IS NOT AMONG THOSE TOO ARDENT YOUNG RADICALS WHO LEAP TO THE CONCLUSION THAT BECAUSE MANY OLD THINGS ARE STUPID AND TIRESOME THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT IS OLD IS TO BE SPURNED WITH CONTEMPT AND EVERYTHING THAT PROCLAIMS ITSELF NEW
WHAT A STRANGE THING THIS LIFE IS WHAT AM I ANYHOW WHERE DO I COME FROM AND WHAT IS GOING TO BECOME OF ME WHAT DO I MEAN WHAT AM I HERE FOR
AND WE SUGGESTED THAT PARENTS AND GUARDIANS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK THE YOUNG TO WAIT BEFORE MARRIAGE AND MAKE CERTAIN OF THE STATE OF THEIR HEARTS WE HAVE NOW THE SAME ADVICE TO GIVE CONCERNING DIVORCE
THE GREAT MASS OF THE PUBLIC HAS SYMPATHY FOR THE LAW BREAKER JUST AS IN OLD DAYS THE PEASANTS COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING THE OUTLAW WHO RESISTED UNJUST LAND LAWS AND ROBBED THE RICH
AND YOU WILL FIND THAT TO THE PREACHER OR EDITOR THIS EVIL CONSISTS OF THE FACT THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE REFUSING TO STAY UNHAPPILY MARRIED IT DOES NOT INTEREST THESE MORALIZERS IF THE STATISTICS SHOW
THEN BEING DISSATISFIED HE WENT TO THE UNRECOGNIZED TEACHERS THE ENTHUSIASTS AND THE CRANKS OF A HUNDRED SCHOOLS FINALLY HE THOUGHT FOR HIMSELF HE WAS EVEN WILLING TO TRY EXPERIMENTS UPON HIMSELF
WHAT TO OUR IGNORANT ANCESTORS WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO BE MIRACLES WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE ALL SORTS OF NEW PLANTS WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO BREED THEIR OWN KIND AND SURVIVE FOREVER IF WE GIVE THEM PROPER CARE IN OTHER WORDS LUTHER BURBANK
LOOKING ABOUT HIM HE SEES OTHERS MAKING THESE SAME MISTAKES SUFFERING FOR LACK OF THAT SAME KNOWLEDGE WHICH HE HAS SO PAINFULLY ACQUIRED THIS BEING THE CASE IT SEEMS A FRIENDLY ACT TO OFFER HIS KNOWLEDGE
FINALLY IT IS A KIND BOOK IT IS NOT WRITTEN FOR ITS AUTHOR'S GLORY NOR FOR HIS ENRICHMENT BUT TO TELL YOU THINGS THAT MAY BE USEFUL TO YOU IN THE BRIEF SPAN OF YOUR LIFE
DIVORCE LAWS SUCH AS THE CLERICAL PROPAGANDA URGES UPON US
YOU'RE A BLACK SHAME TO THE SERVICE GOLIGHTLY KEPT HIS TEMPER AND BEGAN EXPLAINING ALL OVER AGAIN FROM THE BEGINNING THEN HE WAS MARCHED OUT OF THE RAIN INTO THE REFRESHMENT ROOM AND TOLD NOT TO MAKE A QUALIFIED FOOL OF HIMSELF
I PERCEIVED MYSELF FALLEN INTO THE ALEXANDRINE LIBRARY OVERWHELMED IN AN OCEAN OF BOOKS THOUSANDS OF VOLUMES CAME TUMBLING ON MY HEAD AMIDST THE RUINS OF THAT PART OF THE VAULT THROUGH WHICH MY CHARIOT HAD DESCENDED
BENEATH A HEAP OF LEARNING HOWEVER I CONTRIVED TO EXTRICATE MYSELF AND ADVANCED WITH AWFUL ADMIRATION THROUGH THE VAST AVENUES OF THE LIBRARY I PERCEIVED ON EVERY SIDE INNUMERABLE VOLUMES AND REPOSITORIES OF ANCIENT LEARNING
DEADENED THE FORCE OF HIS SABRE SO THAT I RECEIVED BUT ONE SCAR ON MY FOREHEAD AND AT THE SAME INSTANT BY A BLOW OF MY SWORD CUT OFF HIS ARM AND HIS HAND AND SABRE FELL TO THE EARTH HE TOTTERED FOR SOME PACES AND DROPPED AT THE FOOT OF HIS ELEPHANT
BUT I'VE NEVER EARD ANY ONE TO TOUCH THIS ERE ORFICER THEY WERE NOT ANGRY WITH HIM THEY RATHER ADMIRED HIM THEY HAD SOME BEER AT THE REFRESHMENT ROOM AND OFFERED GOLIGHTLY SOME TOO BECAUSE HE HAD SWORE WON'ERFUL
EVERYONE LIKED HIM AND NOBODY EVER DREAMED OF SEEING HIM HANDCUFFED ON A STATION PLATFORM AS A DESERTER BUT THIS SAD THING HAPPENED HE WAS GOING DOWN FROM DALHOUSIE AT THE END OF HIS LEAVE RIDING DOWN
TOLD HIM IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE MUNCHAUSEN SHOULD NEVER BE SAID TO ACCEPT FROM SO GALLANT A WARRIOR ON WHICH TIPPOO INSTANTLY DISCHARGED HIS CARBINE THE BALL FROM WHICH HITTING MY HORSE'S EAR MADE HIM PLUNGE WITH RAGE AND INDIGNATION
WHEN HE GOT INTO PATHANKOTE HE COULDN'T FIND HIS SERVANTS HIS BOOTS WERE STIFF AND ROPY WITH MUD AND THERE WERE LARGE QUANTITIES OF DIRT ABOUT HIS BODY THE BLUE TIE HAD RUN AS MUCH AS THE KHAKI SO HE TOOK IT OFF WITH THE COLLAR AND THREW IT AWAY
HAVING MADE A TRACK WITH MY CHARIOT FROM SEA TO SEA I ORDERED MY TURKS AND RUSSIANS TO BEGIN AND IN A FEW HOURS WE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING A FLEET OF BRITISH EAST INDIAMEN IN FULL SAIL THROUGH THE CANAL
NO MARKS ON THE BODY WHO HAD DESERTED A FORTNIGHT AGO
GOLIGHTLY STEPPED INSIDE AND THE NEXT THING HE KNEW WAS THAT A CONSTABLE WAS ATTACHED TO EACH OF HIS LEGS AND ARMS WHILE THE STATION MASTER WAS TRYING TO CRAM A MAILBAG OVER HIS HEAD
HE EXPLAINED VERY WELL INDEED UNTIL THE CORPORAL CUT IN WITH YOU
THESE GENTRY ON THE CONTRARY TOLD ME A THOUSAND STORIES OF ANTIQUITY THAT SOME OF OUR ANTIQUARIANS WOULD GIVE THEIR VERY EYES TO HEAR IN SHORT I ORDERED THE LIBRARY TO BE PRESERVED
AND HE HOPED I WOULD NOT TELL THE MESS ABOUT IT I DIDN'T BUT YOU CAN IF YOU LIKE NOW THAT GOLIGHTLY HAS GONE HOME GOLIGHTLY SPENT THE GREATER PART OF THAT SUMMER IN TRYING TO GET THE CORPORAL AND THE TWO SOLDIERS TRIED BY COURT MARTIAL
IT NEVER STRUCK HER THAT MISS VEZZIS HAD HER OWN LIFE TO LEAD AND HER OWN AFFAIRS TO WORRY OVER AND THAT THESE AFFAIRS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE WORLD TO MISS VEZZIS VERY FEW MISTRESSES ADMIT THIS SORT OF REASONING
AND THERE UNITED MY FORCES WITH A MILLION OF TURKS ARMED WITH SHOVELS AND PICKAXES THEY DID NOT COME TO CUT EACH OTHER'S THROATS BUT FOR THEIR MUTUAL INTEREST TO FACILITATE COMMERCE AND CIVILISATION
HE PRIDED HIMSELF ON LOOKING NEAT EVEN WHEN HE WAS RIDING POST HE DID LOOK NEAT AND HE WAS SO DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE BEFORE HE STARTED THAT HE QUITE FORGOT TO TAKE ANYTHING BUT SOME SMALL CHANGE WITH HIM
THAT SAGACIOUS ANIMAL SEEING THE DANGER OF HIS MASTER ENDEAVOURED TO PROTECT HIM BY FLOURISHING HIS PROBOSCIS ROUND THE HEAD OF THE SULTAN FEARLESS I ADVANCED AGAINST THE ELEPHANT DESIROUS TO TAKE ALIVE THE HAUGHTY TIPPOO SAHIB
WHO LIVED FOR THE MOST PART ON AN OLD CANE CHAIR IN A GREASY TUSSUR SILK DRESSING GOWN AND A BIG RABBIT WARREN OF A HOUSE FULL OF VEZZISES PEREIRAS RIBIERAS LISBOAS AND GANSALVESES AND A FLOATING POPULATION OF LOAFERS
THOUGH HORRIBLY FRIGHTENED HE FELT THAT FOR THE HOUR HE THE MAN WITH THE COCHIN JEW AND THE MENIAL UNCLE IN HIS PEDIGREE WAS THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF ENGLISH AUTHORITY IN THE PLACE THEN HE THOUGHT OF MISS VEZZIS AND THE FIFTY RUPEES
AND ALL THE SCIENCE OF THE ANTEDILUVIAN WORLD HERE I MET WITH HERMES TRISMEGISTUS AND A PARCEL OF OLD PHILOSOPHERS
BUT IF THE WHOLE REVENUE OF THE DEPARTMENT HE SERVES WERE TO BE HIS REWARD MICHELE COULD NEVER NEVER REPEAT WHAT HE DID AT TIBASU FOR THE SAKE OF MISS VEZZIS THE NURSE GIRL WHICH PROVES THAT WHEN A MAN DOES GOOD WORK OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO HIS PAY
HE WENT TO THE STATION MASTER TO NEGOTIATE FOR A FIRST CLASS TICKET TO KHASA WHERE HE WAS STATIONED THE BOOKING CLERK SAID SOMETHING TO THE STATION MASTER THE STATION MASTER SAID SOMETHING TO THE TELEGRAPH CLERK
THINK OF WHAT SUPERIOR BENEFIT TO MANKIND IS OUR PRESENT UNDERTAKING PERSEVERE AND FORTUNE WILL SECOND YOUR ENDEAVOURS REMEMBER IT IS MUNCHAUSEN WHO LEADS YOU ON AND BE CONVINCED OF SUCCESS
ON WHICH I RESOLVED TO GO TO INDIA AND ENCOUNTER THE TYRANT I TRAVELLED DOWN THE RED SEA TO MADRAS AND AT THE HEAD OF A FEW SEPOYS AND EUROPEANS
MICHELE ANSWERED THAT THE SUB JUDGE MIGHT SAY WHAT HE PLEASED BUT UNTIL THE ASSISTANT COLLECTOR CAME THE TELEGRAPH SIGNALLER WAS THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA IN TIBASU AND THE ELDERS OF THE TOWN WOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR FURTHER RIOTING
IT WOULD BE EASIER TO TALK TO A NEW MADE DUCHESS ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT THAN TO THE BORDERLINE FOLK WITHOUT VIOLATING SOME OF THEIR CONVENTIONS OR HURTING THEIR FEELINGS THE BLACK AND THE WHITE MIX VERY QUAINTLY IN THEIR WAYS
ON WHICH THE INFLAMMABLE AIR RUSHED OUT WITH GREAT FORCE AND THE ROYAL GEORGE DESCENDED LIKE A FALLING STAR INTO THE VERY SPOT FROM WHENCE SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN THERE SHE STILL REMAINS
MICHELE D'CRUZE USED TO SHAMBLE ACROSS THE LOW MUD WALL OF THE COMPOUND AND MAKE LOVE TO MISS VEZZIS AFTER THE FASHION OF THE BORDERLINE WHICH IS HEDGED ABOUT WITH MUCH CEREMONY
IT WAS FAIRLY WARM AT DALHOUSIE AND KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT BELOW HE DESCENDED IN A NEW KHAKI SUIT TIGHT FITTING OF A DELICATE OLIVE GREEN A PEACOCK BLUE TIE WHITE COLLAR AND A SNOWY WHITE SOLAH HELMET
DEBATING UPON THE POLITICS AND LEARNING OF THEIR DAYS I GAVE THEM INEXPRESSIBLE DELIGHT IN TELLING THEM IN A FEW WORDS ALL THE DISCOVERIES OF NEWTON AND THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD SINCE THEIR TIME
GOLIGHTLY DREW HIMSELF UP AND TRIED TO CARRY OFF MATTERS JAUNTILY HE DID NOT FEEL TOO JAUNTY IN HANDCUFFS WITH FOUR CONSTABLES BEHIND HIM AND THE BLOOD FROM THE CUT ON HIS FOREHEAD STIFFENING ON HIS LEFT CHEEK THE CORPORAL WAS NOT JOCULAR EITHER
BUT HE HAD HIS PRIDE HE WOULD NOT BE SEEN SMOKING A HUQA FOR ANYTHING AND HE LOOKED DOWN ON NATIVES AS ONLY A MAN WITH SEVEN EIGHTHS NATIVE BLOOD IN HIS VEINS CAN THE VEZZIS FAMILY HAD THEIR PRIDE TOO THEY TRACED THEIR DESCENT FROM A MYTHICAL PLATE LAYER
AND THROWING THEM AGAINST THE FORTRESS DEMOLISHED THE STRONGEST RAMPARTS OF THE PLACE I TOOK MY MARK SO DIRECT
THAT A BLACK JEW OF COCHIN HAD ONCE MARRIED INTO THE D'CRUZE FAMILY WHILE IT WAS AN OPEN SECRET THAT AN UNCLE OF MISSUS D'CRUZE WAS AT THAT VERY TIME DOING MENIAL WORK CONNECTED WITH COOKING FOR A CLUB IN SOUTHERN INDIA
THE STREETS WERE EMPTY TIBASU WAS MORE FRIGHTENED THAN MICHELE FOR THE MOB HAD BEEN TAKEN AT THE RIGHT TIME MICHELE RETURNED TO THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE
AND IN SPITE OF THE RAIN GOLIGHTLY WAS SWEATING FREELY AT THE END OF ANOTHER MISERABLE HALF HOUR GOLIGHTLY FOUND THE WORLD DISAPPEAR BEFORE HIS EYES IN CLAMMY PULP
HE WAS PROUD OF HIS FACULTY OF ORGANIZATION WHAT WE CALL BUNDOBUST TWENTY TWO MILES OUT OF DALHOUSIE IT BEGAN TO RAIN NOT A MERE HILL SHOWER BUT A GOOD TEPID MONSOONISH DOWNPOUR
BUT I CONVINCED THEM TO THE CONTRARY BY TAKING MY AIM SO EXACTLY WITH A TWELVE POUNDER THAT I BROUGHT HER DOWN IN AN INSTANT I CONSIDERED THAT IF I SHOULD BREAK THE BALLOON WITH A CANNON BALL WHILE SHE REMAINED WITH THE VESSEL OVER THE LAND THE FALL
THEY ASKED HIM TO WAIT FOR HALF AN HOUR WHILE THEY TELEGRAPHED TO UMRITSAR FOR AUTHORITY SO HE WAITED AND FOUR CONSTABLES CAME AND GROUPED THEMSELVES PICTURESQUELY ROUND HIM JUST AS HE WAS PREPARING TO ASK THEM TO GO AWAY THE STATION MASTER SAID THAT
CAME FORTH UPON HIS ELEPHANT TO FIGHT ME I SALUTED HIM AND INSISTED HE SHOULD FIRE FIRST TIPPOO THOUGH A BARBARIAN WAS NOT DEFICIENT IN POLITENESS AND DECLINED THE COMPLIMENT UPON WHICH I TOOK OFF MY HAT AND BOWING
THE UNEDITED AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF PRIVATE ORTHERIS IF THERE WAS ONE THING ON WHICH GOLIGHTLY PRIDED HIMSELF MORE THAN ANOTHER IT WAS LOOKING LIKE AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN HE SAID IT WAS FOR THE HONOR OF THE SERVICE THAT HE ATTIRED HIMSELF SO ELABORATELY
WHERE THE OXUS RIPPLES BY GRIMLY SPAKE ATULLA KHAN LOVE HATH MADE THIS THING A MAN
AND TOOK THE SITUATION ON HIMSELF THERE WERE SEVEN NATIVE POLICEMEN IN TIBASU AND FOUR CRAZY SMOOTH BORE MUSKETS AMONG THEM ALL THE MEN WERE GRAY WITH FEAR BUT NOT BEYOND LEADING
EVEN IN AN EXPURGATED FORM THE FOUR CONSTABLES SAW HIM SAFE TO UMRITSAR IN AN INTERMEDIATE COMPARTMENT AND HE SPENT THE FOUR HOUR JOURNEY IN ABUSING THEM AS FLUENTLY AS HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE VERNACULARS ALLOWED
HINDUS AND MAHOMEDANS TOGETHER RAISED AN AIMLESS SORT OF DONNYBROOK JUST TO SEE HOW FAR THEY COULD GO THEY LOOTED EACH OTHER'S SHOPS AND PAID OFF PRIVATE GRUDGES IN THE REGULAR WAY IT WAS A NASTY LITTLE RIOT BUT NOT WORTH PUTTING IN THE NEWSPAPERS
MICHELE FELT HIMSELF SLIPPING BACK MORE AND MORE INTO THE NATIVE AND THE TALE OF THE TIBASU RIOTS ENDED WITH THE STRAIN ON THE TELLER IN AN HYSTERICAL OUTBURST OF TEARS BRED BY SORROW THAT HE HAD KILLED A MAN
BUT HE DREW A PISTOL FROM HIS BELT AND DISCHARGED IT FULL IN MY FACE AS I RUSHED UPON HIM WHICH DID ME NO FURTHER HARM THAN WOUND MY CHEEK BONE WHICH DISFIGURES ME SOMEWHAT UNDER MY LEFT EYE
HE PUSHED ON INTO PATHANKOTE TO FIND HIS SERVANTS HE DID NOT KNOW THEN THAT HIS KHITMATGAR HAD STOPPED BY THE ROADSIDE TO GET DRUNK AND WOULD COME ON THE NEXT DAY SAYING THAT HE HAD SPRAINED HIS ANKLE
AND IT HUNG DOWN IN SLIPS ON HIS SHOULDERS WHICH WERE A GOOD DEAL SCRATCHED HE WAS HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A SHIRT AS NEARLY IN TWO PIECES AS IT COULD BE AND HE WAS BEGGING THE GUARD TO LOOK AT THE NAME ON THE TAIL OF IT AS HE HAD RUCKED THE SHIRT ALL OVER HIS HEAD I COULDN'T AT FIRST SEE WHO HE WAS BUT
NOR CAN YOU EXPECT TO HEAR OF IT FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME I SIMPLY RELATE THE ENCOUNTER AS IT HAPPENED BETWEEN THE SULTAN AND ME AND IF THERE BE ANY ONE WHO DOUBTS THE TRUTH OF WHAT I SAY HE IS AN INFIDEL AND I WILL FIGHT HIM AT ANY TIME AND PLACE
AND CHALLENGES TIPPOO SAHIB TO SINGLE COMBAT THEY FIGHT THE BARON RECEIVES SOME WOUNDS TO HIS FACE BUT AT LAST VANQUISHES THE TYRANT THE BARON RETURNS TO EUROPE AND RAISES THE HULL OF THE ROYAL GEORGE
WHO HAD WORKED ON THE SONE BRIDGE WHEN RAILWAYS WERE NEW IN INDIA AND THEY VALUED THEIR ENGLISH ORIGIN
NEVER TO FORGET MISS VEZZIS AND SHE SWORE BY HER HONOR AND THE SAINTS THE OATH RUNS RATHER CURIOUSLY
AND POUR ALL THE WEALTH OF INDIA BY A NEW CHANNEL INTO EUROPE MY BRAVE FELLOWS SAID I CONSIDER THE IMMENSE LABOUR OF THE CHINESE TO BUILD THEIR CELEBRATED WALL
BUT THE LEATHER BAND AND GREEN LINING KEPT THINGS ROUGHLY TOGETHER SO THAT THE HAT DID NOT ACTUALLY MELT AWAY WHERE IT FLAPPED PRESENTLY THE PULP AND THE GREEN STUFF MADE A SORT OF SLIMY MILDEW WHICH RAN OVER GOLIGHTLY IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS
AND GAVE HER CONSENT TO THE MARRIAGE OF HER DAUGHTER WITH MICHELE ON CONDITION THAT MICHELE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST FIFTY RUPEES A MONTH TO START MARRIED LIFE UPON
I WAS SENSIBLE OF THE FAILURE OF THE VARIOUS MEANS HITHERTO EMPLOYED FOR THE PURPOSE AND THEREFORE INCLINED TO TRY A METHOD DIFFERENT FROM ANY BEFORE ATTEMPTED I GOT AN IMMENSE BALLOON MADE OF THE TOUGHEST SAIL CLOTH
GOLIGHTLY DID NOT SAY ANYTHING WORTH RECORDING HERE HE TORE OFF AND SQUEEZED UP AS MUCH OF THE BRIM AS WAS IN HIS EYES AND PLOUGHED ON THE BACK OF THE HELMET WAS FLAPPING ON HIS NECK AND THE SIDES STUCK TO HIS EARS
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TELEGRAPH MAP OF INDIA YOU WILL SEE A LONG LINE SKIRTING THE COAST FROM BACKERGUNGE TO MADRAS MICHELE WAS ORDERED TO TIBASU A LITTLE SUB OFFICE ONE THIRD DOWN THIS LINE
BUT MICHELE WAS DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH MISS VEZZIS AND THAT HELPED HIM TO ENDURE HE ACCOMPANIED MISS VEZZIS TO MASS ONE SUNDAY AND AFTER MASS WALKING HOME THROUGH THE HOT STALE DUST WITH HER HAND IN HIS HE SWORE BY SEVERAL SAINTS WHOSE NAMES WOULD NOT INTEREST YOU
MICHELE DROPPED THE KEY OF THE TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT AND WENT OUT AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMY TO MEET THE MOB AS THE SHOUTING CREW CAME ROUND A CORNER OF THE ROAD HE DROPPED AND FIRED THE MEN BEHIND HIM LOOSING INSTINCTIVELY AT THE SAME TIME
AND ADDED SHE RISING WITH ALL THE MAJESTY OF THE CZARINA EMPRESS OF HALF THE WORLD BE IT KNOWN TO ALL SUBJECTS THAT WE ORDAIN THESE CONDITIONS FOR SUCH IS OUR ROYAL WILL AND PLEASURE
AND IN A FEW MINUTES APPEARED FLOATING AMONG THE CLOUDS IT WAS THEN THE OPINION OF MANY PHILOSOPHERS THAT IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT TO GET HER DOWN THEN IT HAD BEEN TO DRAW HER UP
THE STATION MASTER TOLD HIM HE WAS
THESE HEARING NOTHING OF THE COLLECTOR SAHIB FOR SOME TIME AND HEARTILY DESPISING THE HINDU SUB JUDGE ARRANGED TO START A LITTLE MOHURRUM RIOT OF THEIR OWN BUT THE HINDUS TURNED OUT AND BROKE THEIR HEADS WHEN FINDING LAWLESSNESS PLEASANT
ARE ALWAYS BEFORE A NATIVE HE IS AS INCAPABLE AS A CHILD OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT AUTHORITY MEANS OR WHERE IS THE DANGER OF DISOBEYING IT TIBASU WAS A FORGOTTEN LITTLE PLACE WITH A FEW ORISSA MOHAMEDANS IN IT
HE LEFT ALL HIS NOTES AT THE HOTEL HIS SERVANTS HAD GONE DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE HIM TO BE READY IN WAITING AT PATHANKOTE WITH A CHANGE OF GEAR THAT WAS WHAT HE CALLED TRAVELLING IN LIGHT MARCHING ORDER
AND HAD CONFERRED WITH THE SUB JUDGE TILL THAT EXCELLENT OFFICIAL TURNED GREEN HE FOUND TIME TO DRAUGHT AN OFFICIAL LETTER DESCRIBING THE CONDUCT OF MICHELE WHICH LETTER FILTERED THROUGH THE PROPER CHANNELS AND ENDED IN THE TRANSFER OF MICHELE UP COUNTRY ONCE MORE
TO SEND MESSAGES ON FROM BERHAMPUR TO CHICACOLA AND TO THINK OF MISS VEZZIS AND HIS CHANCES OF GETTING FIFTY RUPEES A MONTH OUT OF OFFICE HOURS HE HAD THE NOISE OF THE BAY OF BENGAL AND A BENGALI BABU FOR COMPANY NOTHING MORE
HE SENT MISSUS D'CRUZE SEVEN RUPEES EIGHT ANNAS A MONTH BUT SHE FELT THE DISGRACE TO THE FAMILY VERY KEENLY ALL THE SAME HOWEVER IN THE COURSE OF A FEW SUNDAYS MISSUS VEZZIS BROUGHT HERSELF TO OVERLOOK THESE BLEMISHES
FROM THE WAY HE SWORE WHILE HE WRESTLED WITH HIS RAGS
AND HAS AN AWFUL HANKERING TO GET HOME HERE TO THIS VERY HOUSE
WHERE MEN WERE MOVING FLATS OF SCENERY FROM A BACK DOOR OF THE NEW THEATRE INTO A SORT OF TUMBRIL THE THEATRE WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD BUT TO ROMARIN IT WAS THE NEW THEATRE
WELL MISSUS JOEL AND I HAD A CHAT SHE TOLD ME ALL HER TROUBLES SHE ALWAYS HAS LOTS OF THEM SARAH WAS ALWAYS OF A GRUMBLING TURN AND SHE HAD A BRAND NEW STOCK OF THEM THIS TIME
ITS INSIDE WAS ENTIRELY NEW ITS CHEAP GLITTERING WALL MIRRORS THAT GAVE A FALSE IMPRESSION OF THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PLACE ITS LOVES AND SHEPHERDESSES PAINTED IN THE STYLE OF THE CARTS OF THE VENDORS OF ICE CREAM
ROMARIN AGREED A LITTLE SADLY IT'S YOUR TONE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT MAKES THINGS A LITTLE DIFFICULT BELIEVE ME I'VE NO END IN MY MIND EXCEPT PURE FRIENDLINESS
HOW HAD THAT DOOR KNOCKER COME TO BE LEFT BY THE OLD CROWD THAT HAD WRENCHED OFF SO MANY OTHERS BY WHAT ACCIDENT HAD THAT SURVIVED TO BRING BACK ALL THE OLD LIFE NOW SO ODDLY HE STOOD
BUT I WANTED TO COME SO MUCH IT IS SO NICE TO BE HOME AGAIN
WATCHING HIM GULP IT DOWN QUEER LOOKING BACK ACROSS ALL THAT TIME AT EM ISN'T IT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT IN A MIXED
SUCH RAMPAGEOUS YOUNG ONES I NEVER SAW
AND ROMARIN HAD FELT A GENUINE FLUSH OF PLEASURE WHEN MARSDEN HAD ACCEPTED HIS INVITATION TO DINNER BUT ROMARIN LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AGAIN IT WAS RATHER LIKE MARSDEN TO BE LATE
AND ROMARIN HONOURED AND SUCCESSFUL YET KNEW THAT HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE MARSDEN TO BE LATE FOR ALL THAT AT FIRST
HE SAID LET'S SEE WHAT YOU MEAN BY HELP FIRST DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT YOU WANT ME TO BORROW MONEY FROM YOU THAT'S HELP AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOWADAYS THEN YOU'VE CHANGED SAID ROMARIN WONDERING
YOU'RE A PERVERSE DEVIL STILL WAS ROMARIN'S THOUGHT MARSDEN'S APPARENTLY WAS OF NOTHING BUT THE WHISKEY AND SODA THE WAITER HAD GONE TO FETCH ROMARIN WAS INCLINED TO LOOK ASKANCE AT A MAN
HE WAS A HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW AND LOU HAD A LIKING FOR HIM SO ALL THE GIRLS SAID BUT HE NEVER LOOKED AT HER THAT NIGHT AND HE KEPT BY ME THE WHOLE TIME IT MADE LOU FURIOUS AND AT LAST
SHE WHEELED A SMALL TABLE UP TO HER VISITOR'S SIDE AND SAID VERY KINDLY NOW TAKE A BITE MY DEAR
TO APPROVE AND DISAPPROVE
I BELIEVE THAT AND YOU USUALLY GET WHAT YOU SET OUT FOR OH YES I'VE WATCHED YOUR RISE I'VE MADE A POINT OF WATCHING IT IT'S BEEN A BIT AT A TIME BUT YOU'VE GOT THERE YOU'RE THAT SORT IT'S
AND IF YOU'RE NOT WET TO THE SKIN
MARSDEN'S VOICE AT LEAST HAD NOT CHANGED IT WAS AS IN THE OLD DAYS A LITTLE ENVIOUS SARCASTIC ACCEPTING LOWER INTERPRETATIONS SOMEWHAT WILLINGLY SOMEWHAT GRUDGING OF BETTER ONES
BUT LAWFUL HEART ANNA DON'T MIND ABOUT MY LITTLE AFFAIRS
IF EVER I SAW DEATH IN A WOMAN'S FACE IT
AND HE INDICATED WITH THE KNIFE THE MIRROR AT THE END OF THE TABLE YOU KNOW YOU'VE DONE WELL AND I TO ALL APPEARANCES HAVEN'T YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THAT GLASS AND NOT KNOW IT BUT I'VE FOLLOWED THE LINE OF MY DEVELOPMENT TOO NO LESS LOGICALLY THAN YOU
NOW THAT HIS EYES RESTED ON THEM AGAIN THE SHAPE OF A DOORKNOCKER THE GROUPING OF AN OLD CHIMNEY STACK THE CRACK STILL THERE IN A FLAGSTONE SOMEWHERE DEEP IN THE PAST THESE THINGS HAD ASSOCIATIONS
I NEVER LIKED HER MYSELF ADMITTED MISSUS STAPP SHE THOUGHT HERSELF ABOVE US ALL WELL FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE SHE WAS BUT SHE NEEDN'T HAVE RUBBED IT IN SO WELL SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABOVE ME
PETER'S REAL NEAT AS MEN GO BUT LAWFUL HEART SUCH A MESS AS HE MAKES OF HOUSEKEEPING I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A BROTHER LIVING NO MORE DID I THEODOSIA I THOUGHT AS
YOU REMEMBER THE LAST DAY I WAS TO SEE YOU WE WERE TALKING OF LOU CARROLL WELL
AND FOUR WEEKS AGO I GOT A LETTER FROM A FIRM OF LAWYERS IN MELBOURNE AUSTRALIA SAYING THAT MY BROTHER CHARLES BENNETT HAD DIED AND LEFT ALL HIS FORTUNE TO ME I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT AT FIRST BUT THEY SENT ME SOME THINGS OF HIS THAT HE HAD WHEN HE LEFT HOME
LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY ACROSS THE GLASS WITH THE DREGS OF THE GIN AND BITTERS
SEEING WHO HIS GUEST WAS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT AT THE DOOR
BUT I EXPECT IT WILL NEED A LOT OF FIXING UP
WHOSE EMACIATED FACE WORE A PITEOUS EXPRESSION AS SHE LIFTED IT TO MISSUS MARCH
PROTESTED MISSUS STAPP FEEBLY PERHAPS SO BUT IT'S THE WAY I FEEL
THE GROUPING OF THE CHIMNEY STACK AND THE CRACK IN THE FLAGSTONE HAD BEGUN
THE REGENT STREET PHOTOGRAPHIC ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE ACADEMY SUPPLEMENTS HAD MADE WELL KNOWN
ROMARIN WAS PASSING THE RESTAURANT AGAIN THAT THERE HAD BEEN THAT QUICK BLOW ABOUT A GIRL
AND I'D LIKE ANOTHER DRINK HE PUT THE KNIFE DOWN WITH A LITTLE CLAP AS ROMARIN BECKONED TO THE WAITER THERE WAS DISTRESS ON ROMARIN'S FACE HE WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF HAVING ADOPTED A SUPERIOR ATTITUDE
CRIED MISSUS MARCH YES SHE CAME THERE FROM GOODNESS KNOWS WHERE ABOUT A MONTH AGO
LAWFUL HEART
SHE SLIPPED AWAY THIS MORNING WHEN I WAS BUSY IN THE KITCHEN
AND THE UNFAMILIAR NEW FRONT OF THE LITTLE RESTAURANT HE WAS PASSING AND REPASSING TOOK ON ITS OLD AND WELL KNOWN ASPECT AGAIN SEVEN O'CLOCK HE HAD THOUGHT IN DISMISSING HIS HANSOM
SHE SAID WITH A FEEBLE ATTEMPT AT DIGNITY I AM MISSUS BAXTER I
I DECLARE I THOUGHT THE CHIMNEY WAS AFIRE THEODOSIA THEODOSIA HE SHOUTED ANNA MARCH HAS HAD A FORTUNE LEFT HER BY HER BROTHER IN AUSTRALY
THEN HE REACHED FOR HIS ROLL PULLED IT TO PIECES AND ROMARIN REMEMBERED HOW IN THE OLD DAYS MARSDEN HAD ALWAYS EATEN BREAD LIKE THAT BEGAN TO THROW BULLETS OF BREAD INTO HIS MOUTH
WE'RE LOOKING FOR MISSUS BAXTER SHE HAS RUN AWAY AND WE THOUGHT PERHAPS SHE CAME HERE DID SHE
ODDLY SATISFIED IN HIS MEMORY THE CLOCK HAD A PECULIAR CHIME A RATHER ELABORATE ONE ENDING INCONCLUSIVELY ON THE DOMINANT AND FOLLOWED AFTER AN UNUSUALLY LONG INTERVAL BY THE STROKE OF THE HOUR ITSELF
FOR ALL SHE EXPECTED OF IT HER HUSBAND IS DEAD AND I GUESS HE LED HER A LIFE OF IT WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
AND ALL JUST THE SAME AS IT USED TO BE I GUESS SHE IS A SIGHT OF TROUBLE AND MISSUS JOEL AIN'T THE WOMAN TO LIKE THAT BUT THERE SHE HAS TO WORK MOST AWFUL HARD
AGAIN SMILING HIS HANDS FOLDED ON HIS STICK
SAID MISSUS MARCH QUIETLY DIDN'T I SAY SO DEMANDED MISSUS KENT TURNING TO MISSUS STAPP
RAN OUT JUST WHEN I NEEDED IT TO DEPEND ON BESIDES YOU SEE I'VE THOUGHT OF LOU CARROLL ALL THESE YEARS AS SHE WAS WHEN I KNEW HER HANDSOME AND SAUCY AND PROUD BUT THAT POOR CREATURE IN THERE ISN'T ANY MORE LIKE THE LOU CARROLL I KNEW THAN YOU ARE NOT A MITE
BUT AGAIN HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE MUST MAKE ALLOWANCES MEN WHO DON'T COME OFF IN LIFE'S STRUGGLE ARE APT TO BE TOUCHY AND HE WAS AFTER ALL THE SAME OLD MARSDEN THE MAN WITH WHOM
AND THE OLD CARROLL HOUSE BLOSSOMED OUT INTO RENEWED SPLENDOUR THEODOSIA STAPP
THEODOSIA GAVE A STIFLED GASP OF AMAZEMENT BUT MISSUS MARCH WENT SERENELY ON
MARSDEN WAS THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD BETWEEN WHOM AND HIMSELF LAY AS MUCH AS THE SHADOW OF AN ENMITY AND EVEN THAT FAINT SHADOW WAS NOW PASSING ONE DOES NOT GUARD FOR FORTY YEARS
I ONLY WANTED TO WARN YOU THAT I'VE DARED A GOOD MANY THINGS IN MY TIME NOW DROP IT ROMARIN HAD FINE BROWN EYES UNDER ORIENTAL ARCHED BROWS AGAIN THEY NOTED THE SINGULARLY VICIOUS LOOK OF THE MAN OPPOSITE
HOWEVER IN HIS SECRET HEART WHETHER MARSDEN HAD CHANGED VERY MUCH IN THAT RESPECT AFTER ALL MARSDEN GAVE A SHORT HONK OF A LAUGH YOU DIDN'T SUPPOSE I HADN'T CHANGED DID YOU THEN HE LEANED SUDDENLY FORWARD
NOT UNTIL ITS LAST VIBRATION HAD BECOME TOO SUBTLE FOR HIS EAR HAD ROMARIN RESUMED THE OCCUPATION THAT THE PEALING OF THE HOUR HAD INTERRUPTED IT WAS AN OCCUPATION THAT ESPECIALLY TENDED TO ABSTRACTION OF MIND
HE HAD NOT FORTY YEARS AGO BEEN THE FAMOUS PAINTER HONOURED DECORATED TAKEN BY THE ARM BY MONARCHS
BUT MISSUS KENT DECLINED I'VE GOT TO HURRY HOME STRAIGHT OFF AND GET THE MEN'S SUPPERS SUCH A SCAMPER TO HAVE OVER THAT WOMAN I'M SURE I'M THANKFUL YOU'RE WILLING TO LET HER STAY FOR SHE'D NEVER BE CONTENTED ANYWHERE ELSE
IT WAS A PECULIARLY VICIOUS FACE THAT HE SAW CORRUGATED ABOUT THE BROWS AND WITH STIFF IRON GREY HAIR UNTRIMMED ABOUT THE EARS
IT IS A DREADFUL DAY FOR YOU TO BE OUT WHY ON EARTH DIDN'T JOEL KENT DRIVE YOU OVER THEY DIDN'T KNOW I WAS COMING WHISPERED MISSUS BAXTER ANXIOUSLY I I RAN AWAY
IN THREE WEEKS TIME
BUT MARSDEN'S PROMPT POINTING OUT OF THIS WAS NOT ENCOURAGING NOW THAT HE CAME TO THINK OF IT
THE USUAL THING PLEASURE AND REGRET MINGLED OH YOU HAVE REGRETS HAVE YOU FOR CERTAIN THINGS YES NOT LET ME SAY MY TURN UP WITH YOU MARSDEN HE LAUGHED
HE DESIRED TO BE AT PEACE ARE YOU QUITE FAIR TO ME HE ASKED PRESENTLY IN A LOW VOICE
IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS IF ALL GOES WELL I'M HAVING IT ALL PAINTED AND DONE OVER INSIDE THE OUTSIDE CAN WAIT UNTIL THE SPRING IT'S QUEER HOW THINGS COME ABOUT
I DON'T SEE THAT THERE IS ANY CALL FOR A SCENE SAID MISSUS MARCH FIRMLY THE POOR WOMAN HAS JUST GOT HERE AND SHE THINKS SHE HAS GOT HOME SHE MIGHT AS WELL THINK SO IF IT IS OF ANY COMFORT TO HER YOU'D BETTER LEAVE HER HERE
LET ME TAKE YOUR BONNET AND SHAWL I MUST RUN RIGHT OUT TO TELL HANNAH TO GET YOU A HOT DRINK YOU ARE VERY KIND WHISPERED THE OTHER I DON'T KNOW YOU BUT
SEEMED TO COWER BEFORE ITS FURY
ANIMOSITIES THAT TAKE THEIR RISE IN QUICK OUTBREAKS OF THE YOUNG BLOOD AND NOW THAT ROMARIN CAME TO THINK OF IT HE HADN'T REALLY HATED MARSDEN FOR MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS IT HAD BEEN WITHIN THOSE VERY DOORS
THEY NEEDN'T EXPECT TO GET IT OH HOW BADLY I FELT MOTHER AND I WERE
I DON'T KNOW AND IT ISN'T LIKELY I EVER WILL WELL
DID HE LOOK SURLILY UP LET IT REST ROMARIN
I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE ANOTHER DRINK IN PEACE AND QUIETNESS WAITER
MY MARSDEN'S VOICE SOUNDED ACROSS THE GROUP OF SCENE SHIFTERS A MO IF YOU PLEASE GUV'NOR SAID ANOTHER VOICE FOR A MOMENT THE PAINTED WING SHUT THEM OFF FROM ONE ANOTHER
YES I ENJOYED MYSELF PRETTY WELL
IT DOES PAY THEN ROMARIN ASKED OH YES IT PAYS
THIS IS RATHER A MISTAKE ROMARIN RATHER A MISTAKE HE SAID WHAT IS
I COULDN'T BELIEVE BUT WHAT HE WAS JOKING AT FIRST YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN PETER
BUT I'M NOT IN THE HABIT OF WASTING MUCH TIME OVER MINE MIGHT AS WELL BE MAKING NEW ONES I'LL DRINK WHISKEY AND SODA IT WAS BROUGHT A LARGE ONE AND MARSDEN NODDING TOOK A DEEP GULP HEALTH
THAT IT HAD BEEN LATER HIS APPOINTMENT WAS NOT UNTIL A QUARTER PAST
WAS NOT THE SHORT STUBBLE OF GREY BEARD
AND HAD HAD IT ENGRAVED TO MY FRIEND ROMARIN YOU OUGHTN'T TO BE HERE YOU KNOW HE SAID TO THE DOOR KNOCKER IF I DIDN'T GET YOU MARSDEN OUGHT TO HAVE DONE SO
MY LIFE SAID MARSDEN CALMLY HAS BEEN NOT LITERALLY LITERALLY YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU HAVEN'T OUTGROWN THAT I HOPE NOT
THEY SAT DOWN AT A CORNER TABLE NOT FAR FROM THE SLOWLY MOVING FOUR BLADED PROPELLER NOW WE CAN TALK ROMARIN SAID I'M GLAD GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MARSDEN
HOW TO HELP HE DEMANDED THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME BUT I SUPPOSE FOR EXAMPLE YOU STILL WORK OH MY WORK
YOU DIDN'T ALTOGETHER DISLIKE I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME THINK WHAT IT WAS BY THE WAY AND YOU WANT TO LAY STRESS ON THAT AND TO SINK THE REST WELL YOU CAN'T I WON'T LET YOU I'LL NOT SUBMIT MY LIFE TO YOU LIKE THAT
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT SIR FERDINAND MORRINGER PROMPTLY ARRANGED FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS ACTION OF THREE PARTIES OF POLICE WITH THE HOPE OF CAPTURING ALL THREE OUTLAWS BUT IN TWO CASES THE BIRDS WERE FLOWN STARLIGHT'S
YOUR INTIMATE FRIEND AND PARTNER FOR THE LAST NINE MONTHS YOU PERFECTLY AMAZE ME SAYS CLIFFORD BUT CAN'T YOU BE MISTAKEN IS YOUR INFORMATION TO BE DEPENDED UPON MINE CAME FROM A JEALOUS WOMAN SAYS SIR FERDINAND THEY MAY GENERALLY BE DEPENDED UPON FOR A STRAIGHT TIP
AFTER RIDING TWENTY MILES THE SUN WAS GETTING LOW WHEN BILLY POINTED TO A TRAIL WHICH CAME BROAD WAYS ACROSS THE ROAD AND WHICH THEN FOLLOWED IT HERE THEY ARE P'LEECE AND NO MISTAKE
I DIDN'T SEE EM BUT I CUT THEIR TRACKS FIVE SHOD HORSES THEY MIGHT BE HERE TO MORROW
I WONDER WHETHER I SHALL EVER ASSOCIATE WITH GENTLEMEN AGAIN THE CHANCES ARE AGAINST IT I HAD ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE TO TELL THEM I WAS GOING AWAY WITH WARRIGAL AND YET NOT TO TELL TOO MUCH WHAT THE DICKENS SAYS CLIFFORD CAN YOU WANT GOING AWAY WITH THIS FAMILIAR OF YOURS AT THIS HOUR OF THE NIGHT YOU'RE LIKE THE FELLOW IN SCOTT'S NOVEL
LET ALONE GO OPEN MOUTHED AT IT BUT MIGHTN'T YOU HAVE COME DOWN HERE FROM THE TURON ON SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS NOW AND THEN AND HAD A YARN WITH US ALL OF COURSE WE OUGHT AND WE DESERVE TO BE KICKED THE LOT OF US BUT THERE WERE GOOD REASONS WHY WE DIDN'T LIKE TO
AND WHEN I SAID I'D COME FOR BILL'S SORREL HE THOUGHT IT LIKELY ENOUGH AND GOT OUT THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE I TIPPED HIM WELL AND WENT OFF TELLING HIM I WAS GOING TO WATTLE FLAT TO LOOK AT A QUARTZ CRUSHING PLANT THAT WAS FOR SALE I ACCOUNTED FOR COMING UP SO EARLY BY SAYING I'D LOST MY ROAD
DO YOU KNOW THAT I COULD ARREST YOU AND HASTINGS NOW AND LOCK YOU UP ON SUSPICION OF BEING CONCERNED WITH HIM IN THE BALLABRI BANK ROBBERY SAYS SIR FERDINAND IN A STERN VOICE DON'T LOOK SO INDIGNANT I ONLY SAY I COULD I AM NOT GOING TO DO SO OF COURSE
I SEEN THE P'LEECE A TAKIN HIM ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO BARGO EARLY THIS MORNING THERE WAS POOR OLD JIM A LOOKIN AS IF HE WAS GOIN TO BE HANGED WITH A CHAP LEADING THE SCREW HE WAS ON AND JIM'S LONG LEGS TIED UNDERNEATH I WAS GATHERIN CATTLE I WAS
CONFOUND HER SHE'S A HEARTLESS WRETCH AND I HOPE SHE'LL DIE IN A DITCH EXACTLY WELL SHE KNOCKED AND A CONSTABLE OPENED THE OUTER DOOR I WANT TO SEE SIR FERDINAND SHE SAYS HE'S IN BED AND CAN'T BE DISTURBED SAYS THE BOBBY ANY MESSAGE I CAN DELIVER
THERE WAS NO GREAT CHANCE IN THE OLD TIMES WITH ONLY A FEW SHEPHERDS AND STOCK RIDERS WANDERING THROUGH THE BUSH ONCE IN A WAY STRAGGLING OVER THE COUNTRY BUT NOW THE WHOLE COLONY SWARMED WITH MINERS WHO WERE ALWAYS PROSPECTING AS THEY CALLED IT THAT IS LOOKING OUT FOR FRESH PATCHES OF GOLD
WAS ONE OF THOSE SHILLING FLASKS OF BRANDY THEY SELL FOR CHAPS TO GO ON THE ROAD WITH BRANDY AIN'T A GOOD THING AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS AND I'VE SEEN MORE THAN ONE MAN OR A DOZEN EITHER THAT MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE SAWED AWAY AT THEIR THROATS WITH A BLUNT KNIFE AS PUT THE FIRST GLASS TO THEIR LIPS
TEN TIMES MORE CHANCE OF OUR BEING TRACKED OR RUN DOWN THAN EVER THAT WE KNEW FROM THE NEWSPAPERS HOW DID WE SEE THEM OH THE OLD WAY WE SENT OUT OUR SCOUT WARRIGAL
THE COMPARATIVE LULL OBSERVABLE IN SUCH EXCITING OCCURRENCES OF LATE HAS BEEN PROVED TO BE BUT THE OMINOUS HUSH OF THE ELEMENTS THAT PRECEDES THE TEMPEST WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS THE MINING COMMUNITY HAS BEEN STARTLED BY THE DISCOVERY OF THE NOTORIOUS GANG OF BUSH RANGERS STARLIGHT AND THE MARSTONS
FOR JAMES MARSTON WHO WAS MARRIED BUT A SHORT WHILE SINCE TO A MELBOURNE YOUNG LADY OF HIGH PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS AND THE MOST WINNING AMIABILITY GREAT SYMPATHY HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY ALL CLASSES SO MUCH FOR THE STAR
IT WAS A LONG WAY INTO THE NIGHT AND NOT FAR FROM DAYLIGHT EITHER WHEN WE STUMBLED UP TO THE CAVE DEAD BEAT HORSES AND MEN BOTH WE'D TWO MINDS TO CAMP ON THE MOUNTAIN BUT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED UP HARD AS WE'D RIDDEN AND WE DIDN'T LIKE TO THROW A CHANCE AWAY
WE DROPPED IN TO BREAKFAST HERE AT DAYLIGHT AND I FELT SLEEPY ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER SNOOZE WE'RE ALL HERE AGAIN IT SEEMS I SAID SOUR ENOUGH
AS WE RODE ALONG I SETTLED UPON THE WAY I'D TRY AND SET POOR JIM FREE BAD OFF AS I WAS MYSELF I COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE HIM CHAINED UP
SOMETHING MADE ME LOOK OVER TO A PARTICULAR CORNER WHERE STARLIGHT ALWAYS SLEPT WHEN HE WAS AT THE HOLLOW
AS WE CAME CLOSE OUT WALKS OLD CRIB AND SMELLS AT US HE KNEW US IN A MINUTE AND JUMPED UP AND BEGAN TO TRY AND LICK JIM'S HAND THE OLD STORY
WE HAD LONG TALKS AND BARNEYS OVER THE WHOLE THING SOMETIMES BY OURSELVES WITH STARLIGHT SOMETIMES WITH FATHER A LONG TIME IT WAS BEFORE WE SETTLED UPON ANY REGULAR PUT UP BIT OF WORK TO DO SOONER OR LATER WE BEGAN TO SEE THE SECRET OF THE HOLLOW WOULD BE FOUND OUT
BUT SOFT AS THEY SAY IN THE PLAY WHERE AM I I THOUGHT I WAS A VIRTUOUS MINER AGAIN HERE WE ARE AT THIS DEVIL DISCOVERED DEMON HAUNTED OLD HOLLOW AGAIN
HOW SHOULD I KNOW HIS INFERNAL PURSER'S NAME NO MAN IT SEEMS TO ME HAS HIS RIGHT NAME ON THIS CONFOUNDED GOLDFIELD I MEAN STARLIGHT STARLIGHT THE CATTLE STEALER THE MAIL ROBBER THE BUSH RANGER WHOSE NAME IS NOTORIOUS OVER THE THREE COLONIES AND NEW ZEALAND TO BOOT
THE ELDER MARSTON HAD ALSO ELUDED THE POLICE BUT JAMES MARSTON HINDERED POSSIBLY BY DOMESTIC TIES WAS CAPTURED AT HIS COTTAGE AT SPECIMEN GULLY FOR HIM SYMPATHY HAS BEEN UNIVERSALLY EXPRESSED
SO HE STALKED THE FAIR AND FURIOUS KATE THAT WAS HOW IT WAS THEN YES MUCH IN THAT WAY I MUST SAY DICK THAT IF YOU ARE SO EXTREMELY FOND OF WELL STUDYING THE FEMALE CHARACTER YOU SHOULD CARRY ON THE PURSUIT MORE DISCREETLY
AND I MADE READY TO RESCUE JIM IF IT COULD BE MANAGED ANYHOW HOW WAS IT TO BE DONE I COULD DEPEND ON THE RIFLE CARRYING TRUE AT SHORT RANGES BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE NOTION OF FIRING AT A MAN BEHIND HIS BACK LIKE
OF THE MARSTON BROTHERS THE ELDER ONE RICHARD WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY APPRISED BUT JAMES MARSTON WAS ARRESTED IN HIS COTTAGE IN SPECIMEN GULLY HAVING BEEN LATELY MARRIED HE WAS APPARENTLY UNWILLING TO LEAVE HIS HOME AND LINGERED TOO LONG FOR PRUDENCE
THE GOVERNOR TOLD ME YOU AND JIM HAD MADE BACK DREADFUL BORE ISN'T IT JUST WHEN WE'D ALL RUBBED OFF THE RUST OF OUR BUSH LIFE AND WERE GETTING CIVILISED I FEEL VERY SERIOUSLY ILL TREATED I ASSURE YOU I HAVE A GREAT MIND TO APPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR COMPENSATION
WARRIGAL HAD HEARD QUITE ENOUGH HE RIPS OVER TO DALY'S MOB BORROWS A HORSE SADDLE AND BRIDLE AND LEADS HIM STRAIGHT DOWN TO OUR CAMP HE ROUSED ME UP ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK AND I COULD HARDLY MAKE ANY EXPLANATION TO MY MATES SUCH STUNNING GOOD FELLOWS THEY WERE TOO
HE CAN MOSTLY TRACK LIKE A BLACKFELLOW AND TELL YOU WHETHER THE CATTLE OR HORSES WHICH HE SEES THE TRACKS OF ARE BELONGING TO HIS COUNTRY OR ARE STRANGERS HE CAN GET YOU A FRESH HORSE ON A PINCH
WELL THE COUNTRY HAD CHANGED AND WE WERE BOUND TO CHANGE WITH IT WE COULDN'T STOP BOXED UP IN THE HOLLOW DAY AFTER DAY AND MONTH AFTER MONTH SHOOTING AND HORSE BREAKING DOING NOTHING AND EARNING NOTHING IF WE WENT OUTSIDE THERE WERE TEN TIMES MORE MEN LOOKING OUT FOR US THAN EVER
JIM WAS STANDING BY SAYIN NOTHING WHILE I WAS TAKING OFF THE SADDLES AND BRIDLES AND LETTING THE HORSES GO WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE GIVES A LURCH FORWARD AND IF THE OLD MAN HADN'T LAID HOLD OF HIM IN HIS STRONG ARMS AND PROPPED HIM UP HE'D HAVE GONE DOWN FACE FOREMOST LIKE A GIRL IN A DEAD FAINT
TURN OUT HE ROARS OUT FIRST THEN DROPPING HIS VOICE SAYS OUT MY DEAR MISSUS MULLOCKSON YOU SHOULD HEAR WARRIGAL IMITATE HIM YOU HAVE MADE MY FORTUNE OFFICIALLY I MEAN OF COURSE I SHALL NEVER FORGET YOUR KINDNESS THANKS A THOUSAND TIMES
WE'RE ONLY INDEBTED TO SOMEBODY'S LAYING THE TRAPS ON A WOMAN OF COURSE FOR YOUR HONOUR'S COMPANY NEVER MIND OLD MAN I WON'T HIT YOU WHEN YOU'RE DOWN BUT I SAY YOU GO AND HAVE A YARN WITH BILLY THE BOY HE'S IN THE KITCHEN I BELIEVE THE YOUNG IMP KNOWS SOMETHING BUT HE WON'T LET ON TO BELL AND I
WE WERE REGULARLY BOXED UP WITH THE DIGGERS NOBODY KNEW WHO WE WERE OR WHERE WE CAME FROM AND ONLY FOR THIS JEZEBEL NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN IF WE'D COME HERE THEY'D HAVE ALL DROPPED THAT WE WERE OLD FRIENDS
I HEARD MOST OF THIS FROM THAT YOUNG DEVIL BILLY THE BOY HE SAW SIR FERDINAND RIDE UP SO HE HID CLOSE BY JUST FOR THE FUN OF HEARING HOW HE GOT ON HE'D SEEN WARRIGAL AND ME RIDE AWAY FRANK DEVIL BANGS OUT SIR FERDINAND WHO'D BEGUN TO GET HIS MONKEY UP
GOOD BYE CLIFFORD YOU'LL HEAR NEWS OF YOUR FRIEND BEFORE LONG OR I'M MUCH MISTAKEN STOP SIR FERDINAND YOU MUST PARDON ME BUT I DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND YOUR TONE THE MAN THAT WE KNEW BY THE NAME OF FRANK HAUGHTON MAY BE AS YOU SAY AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL
BUT WE'RE LOSING TIME WHEN DID HE LEAVE THE CLAIM AND WHICH WAY DID HE GO I HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WAY HE WENT SAYS CLIFFORD HE DID NOT SAY BUT HE LEFT ABOUT AN HOUR SINCE ON FOOT OR ON HORSEBACK ON HORSEBACK ANY ONE WITH HIM YES ANOTHER HORSEMAN
I REMEMBER HIM GIVING ME A HIDIN WHEN I WAS A KIDDY FOR SAYING SOMETHING I WASN'T SURE OF MY WORD I WAS THAT SORE FOR A WEEK AFTER I COULDN'T BUTTON MY SHIRT BUT AIN'T IT A PITY ABOUT JIM
ONE MAN WAS A BIT IN FRONT RIDING A FINE HORSE TOO
BECAME PARTNER AND TENT MATE WITH THE HON MISTER CLIFFORD AND MISTER HASTINGS AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY IN WHICH THE MANNERS AND BEARING OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN PERMITTED HIM TO MINGLE WITHOUT SUSPICION OF DETECTION SUDDENLY INFORMATION WAS FURNISHED TO THE POLICE RESPECTING ALL THREE MEN
OUR RESPECTED AND EFFICIENT INSPECTOR OF POLICE SIR FERDINAND MORRINGER PROCEEDED SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT TO THE CAMP OF MESSRS CLIFFORD AND HASTINGS HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN ARRESTING THE FAMOUS STARLIGHT WHO UNDER THE COGNOMEN OF THE HONOURABLE FRANK HAUGHTON
WHILE THE STEAKS WERE FRYING AND THEY SMELT VERY GOOD BAD AS I FELT I CALLED OUT MASTER BILLY AND HAD A TALK WITH HIM I HANDED HIM A NOTE TO BEGIN WITH IT WAS MONEY WELL SPENT AND YOU MARK MY WORDS A SHILLING SPENT IN GROG OFTEN BUYS A MAN TWENTY TIMES THE WORTH OF IT IN INFORMATION
WE DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR A FEW DAYS YOU MAY BE SURE
I COULDN'T LET THEM TAKE HIM AWAY TO HIS DEATH I COULD SEE HE WOULDN'T LIVE A MONTH HE'D GO FRETTING HIS LIFE ABOUT JEANIE
I'D MADE A BIT OF A BARGAIN WITH JONATHAN WHO SOLD ME A PAIR OF RIDING BOOTS BUTCHER'S AND A BIG TWEED PONCHO THE BOOTS WERE EASIER TO TAKE A LONG ROUGH RIDE IN THAN TROUSERS AND I WANTED THE PONCHO TO KEEP THE BALLARD RIFLE UNDER IT WOULDN'T DO TO HAVE IT IN YOUR HAND ALL THE TIME
BUSH RANGING REVIVED THE GOOD OLD DAYS HAVE APPARENTLY NOT PASSED AWAY FOR EVER WHEN MAIL ROBBERIES AND HAND TO HAND CONFLICTS WITH ARMED ROBBERS WERE MATTERS OF WEEKLY OCCURRENCE
RODE POOR OLD JIM LOOKING AS IF HE WAS GOING TO BE HANGED THAT DAY AS BILLY SAID THOUGH I KNEW WELL HE WASN'T THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE JIM EVER LOOKED MISERABLE FOR SO LONG SINCE HE WAS BORN WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE
THOUGH WE HADN'T HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT
THERE WAS NO USE BEING SHOT DOWN WITHOUT A CHANCE SO HE GAVE HIMSELF UP MY WORD DICK HE SAID I WISHED FOR A BARE BACKED HORSE AND A DEEP GULLY THEN BUT IT WASN'T TO BE
WHILE REJOICING AS MUST ALL GOOD CITIZENS AT THE DISCOVERY OF EVIL DOERS AND THE CAPTURE OF ONE MEMBER OF A BAND OF NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS WE MUST STATE IN FAIRNESS AND CANDOUR THAT THEIR CONDUCT HAS BEEN WHILE ON THE FIELD AS MINERS FREE FROM REPROACH IN EVERY WAY
MY COLONIAL OATH DICK YOU'RE QUITE THE GENTLEMAN FREE WITH YOUR MONEY JUST THE SAME AS EVER YOU TAKES AFTER THE OLD GOVERNOR
DOMICILED IN THE VERY HEART OF THE DIGGINGS ATTIRED AS ORDINARY MINERS AND FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES POSSIBLY LEADING THE LABORIOUS LIVES PROPER TO THE AVOCATION
THEY'RE NOT ALL AS GOOD AS BILLY THE BOY BUT THE WORST OF EM LIKE A BAD SHEEP DOG IS A DEAL BETTER THAN NONE A BUSH TELEGRAPH YOU SEE IS MOSTLY WORKED ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HE WAS BORN IN
BILLY HAD GROWN A SQUARISH SET MIDDLE SIZED CHAP HIS HAIR WASN'T SO LONG AND HIS CLOTHES WERE BETTER HIS EYE WAS AS BRIGHT AND BOLD LOOKING
I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF THEY'D MAKE YOU A BEAK IF YOU'D STAYED THERE LONG ENOUGH I'M AFRAID DICK'S DROPPING THE POLICEMAN WON'T ADD TO OUR POPULARITY THOUGH HE'S ALL RIGHT I SAID HURRAH LOOK HERE I'M GLAD I DIDN'T FINISH THE POOR BEGGAR LISTEN TO THIS FROM THE TURON BANNER
THAT I WAS READING OVER AGAIN YESTERDAY THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER THAT'S CALLED FOR AT MIDNIGHT BY THE AVENGER OF BLOOD DEPARTS WITH HIM AND IS NEVER SEEN MORE IN CASE YOU NEVER SEE ME AFTERWARDS I SAID WE'D BETTER SAY GOOD BYE WE'VE BEEN GOOD MATES AND TRUE FRIENDS HAVEN'T WE
I HAVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION SAYS SHE ROUSE HIM UP OR YOU'LL BE SORRY FOR IT WON'T IT DO TO MORROW MORNING SAYS HE NO IT WON'T SAYS SHE STAMPING HER FOOT
HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN BADLY WOUNDED THE OTHER TROOPER REPORTS THAT HE WAS SHOT DOWN AND THE PARTY ATTACKED BY PERSONS CONCEALED IN THE THICK TIMBER NEAR WILD HORSE CREEK AT THE EDGE OF BARGO BRUSH IN THE CONFUSION THAT ENSUED THE PRISONER ESCAPED IT WAS AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT WALSH WAS FATALLY INJURED
WE COULD MAKE OUR OWN WAY FROM THERE AND SO WE SENT OFF OUR SCOUT
SEE HERE BILLY I SAID HERE'S ANOTHER POUND FOR YOU AND THERE'LL BE A FIVER AFTER IF YOU STICK WELL TO ME TO DAY I WON'T LET JIM BE WALKED OFF TO BERRIMA WITHOUT A FLUTTER TO SAVE HIM IT'LL BE THE DEATH OF HIM HE'S NOT LIKE ME AND HE'S GOT A YOUNG WIFE BESIDES
BUT OUR LATEST REPORT GIVES GOOD HOPE OF HIS RECOVERY
TILL WE CAME TO OUR HORSES THEN WE ALL RODE OFF TOGETHER
HOW IS JIM HE'S WORSE OFF THAN EITHER OF US POOR FELLOW JIM'S VERY BAD HE CAN'T GET OVER BEING AWAY FROM JEANIE I NEVER SAW HIM SO DOWN IN THE MOUTH THIS YEARS POOR OLD JIM HE'S A DEAL TOO GOOD FOR THE PLACE SAD MISTAKE THIS GETTING MARRIED
WITH TEN THOUSAND MORE SURE TO FOLLOW WITHIN A MONTH THAT MIGHT HAPPEN AT ANY TIME ON ONE OF THE SPURS OF NULLA MOUNTAIN AND THE FINDING OUT OF THE TRACK DOWN TO THE HOLLOW BY SOME ONE OF THE DOZENS OF RAMBLING SHOOTING FISHING DIGGERS WOULD BE AS CERTAIN TO HAPPEN AS THE SUN TO RISE
HE'S AT SEA BUT WITHIN TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OF WHERE HE WAS BORN AND BRED HE KNOWS EVERY TRACK EVERY RANGE EVERY HILL EVERY CREEK AS WELL AS ALL THE SHORT CUTS AND BY ROADS HE CAN BRING YOU MILES SHORTER THAN ANY ONE THAT ONLY FOLLOWS THE ROAD
WHY YOU LOOK LIKE A GHOST HE DOESN'T HE LOOKS AS IF HE'D BEEN AT A BALL ALL NIGHT PLENTY OF PARTNERS DICK NEVER MIND DICK SAYS MADDIE GO AND MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE IN THAT ROOM AND I'LL HAVE BREAKFAST FOR YOU WHILE YOU'D LET A COW OUT OF THE BAIL WE DON'T FORGET OUR FRIENDS
NEVER BETTER HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE SHALL DO WITHOUT YOU
I NEVER FORGOT IT NOR POOR MADDIE BARNES FOR THINKING OF IT FOR ME AND I DID LIVE TO DO HER A GOOD TURN BACK
AFTER WE'D GOT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AND ON THE FLAT LAND OF THE VALLEY IT RESTED OUR FEET A BIT THAT WAS PRETTY NIGH CUT TO PIECES WITH THE ROCKS OUR HORSES WERE THAT DONE WE DURSN'T RIDE EM FOR HOURS BEFORE
ONE CARRIAGE DELAYED SUFFICED TO PARALYZE THE WHOLE LINE THEN THEY SET OUT AGAIN ON THE MARCH THE WEDDING CARRIAGES WERE IN THE FILE PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BASTILLE AND SKIRTING THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOULEVARD
HE DOES MORE GOOD THAN THE DEVIL DOES HIM HARM THIS CRAFT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE DAYS OF THE TERRESTRIAL PARADISE THE INVENTION IS OLD MY FRIENDS BUT IT IS PERFECTLY NEW PROFIT BY IT BE DAPHNIS AND CHLOE
THE LAUGHTER OF ALL IS THE ACCOMPLICE OF UNIVERSAL DEGRADATION CERTAIN UNHEALTHY FESTIVALS DISAGGREGATE THE PEOPLE AND CONVERT THEM INTO THE POPULACE AND POPULACES LIKE TYRANTS REQUIRE BUFFOONS THE KING HAS ROQUELAURE
HERE WE PAUSE ON THE THRESHOLD OF WEDDING NIGHTS STANDS A SMILING ANGEL WITH HIS FINGER ON HIS LIPS THE SOUL ENTERS INTO CONTEMPLATION BEFORE THAT SANCTUARY WHERE THE CELEBRATION OF LOVE TAKES PLACE THERE SHOULD BE FLASHES OF LIGHT ATHWART SUCH HOUSES
IN HIS CAPACITY OF COSETTE'S SUPERVISING GUARDIAN HAD SUPPLIED HIS PLACE WE WILL NOT CONDUCT THE READER EITHER TO THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OR TO THE CHURCH ONE DOES NOT FOLLOW A PAIR OF LOVERS TO THAT EXTENT
BECAUSE IT IS A GEWGAW AH YOU ARE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WELL WHAT THEN AND WE HAVE BEEN AS FOOLISH AS YOU
GAYETY ROARS SARCASM FLAMES FORTH JOVIALITY IS FLAUNTED LIKE A RED FLAG TWO JADES THERE DRAG FARCE BLOSSOMED FORTH INTO AN APOTHEOSIS IT IS THE TRIUMPHAL CAR OF LAUGHTER A LAUGHTER THAT IS TOO CYNICAL TO BE FRANK
ARE VERY FAMILIAR TO PARISIANS IF THEY WERE MISSING ON A SHROVE TUESDAY OR AT THE MID LENT IT WOULD BE TAKEN IN BAD PART AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND THAT PROBABLY THE MINISTRY IS ABOUT TO UNDERGO A CHANGE
THIS EVENING YOU SHALL HAVE ONE FROM YOUR GRANDFATHER LISTEN TO ME I WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF ADVICE ADORE EACH OTHER I DO NOT MAKE A PACK OF GYRATIONS I GO STRAIGHT TO THE MARK BE HAPPY IN ALL CREATION
TO REALIZE ONE'S DREAM TO WHOM IS THIS ACCORDED THERE MUST BE ELECTIONS FOR THIS IN HEAVEN WE ARE ALL CANDIDATES UNKNOWN TO OURSELVES THE ANGELS VOTE COSETTE AND MARIUS HAD BEEN ELECTED COSETTE
DOWN WITH THE PHILOSOPHERS WISDOM CONSISTS IN JUBILATION MAKE MERRY LET US MAKE MERRY ARE WE HAPPY BECAUSE WE ARE GOOD OR ARE WE GOOD BECAUSE WE ARE HAPPY
THERE WAS A TUMULT THEN SILENCE THE MARRIED PAIR DISAPPEARED A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT
NEVER MIND THAT OLD COVE WHO HAS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH HIS PAW I KNOW AND THAT I'M POSITIVE AND WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO KNOW HIM
IT IS DONE WITH IT IS BROKEN IT LIES ON THE EARTH THERE IS NO LONGER ANY SCEPTRE BUT MAKE ME A REVOLUTION AGAINST THAT LITTLE EMBROIDERED HANDKERCHIEF WHICH SMELLS OF PATCHOULI I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU DO IT TRY WHY IS IT SO SOLID
THAT THE CROWD LOVES TO BEHOLD THAT MONSTROUS LIVING PILE OF TINSEL RAGS HALF DUNG HALF LIGHT ROLL BY ON FOUR WHEELS HOWLING AND LAUGHING THAT THEY SHOULD CLAP THEIR HANDS AT THIS GLORY COMPOSED OF ALL SHAMES
MANAGE SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE WITH EACH OTHER NOTHING SHALL BE LACKING TO YOU AND THAT COSETTE MAY BE THE SUN FOR MARIUS AND THAT MARIUS MAY BE THE UNIVERSE TO COSETTE COSETTE LET YOUR FINE WEATHER BE THE SMILE OF YOUR HUSBAND MARIUS
AND IN THAT GLORY THE TWO APOTHEOSES MINGLING IN THE BACKGROUND ONE KNOWS NOT HOW BEHIND A CLOUD FOR COSETTE IN A FLASH FOR MARIUS THERE WAS THE IDEAL THING THE REAL THING THE MEETING OF THE KISS AND THE DREAM
THE NUPTIAL PILLOW ALL THE TORMENTS THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD PASSED CAME BACK TO THEM IN INTOXICATION IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT THEIR SORROWS THEIR SLEEPLESS NIGHTS THEIR TEARS THEIR ANGUISH THEIR TERRORS
WHEN TWO MOUTHS RENDERED SACRED BY LOVE APPROACH TO CREATE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ABOVE THAT INEFFABLE KISS A QUIVERING THROUGHOUT THE IMMENSE MYSTERY OF STARS THESE FELICITIES ARE THE TRUE ONES
THERE IS GOVERNMENT THEREIN THERE ONE LAYS ONE'S FINGER ON A MYSTERIOUS AFFINITY BETWEEN PUBLIC MEN AND PUBLIC WOMEN IT CERTAINLY IS SAD THAT TURPITUDE HEAPED UP SHOULD GIVE A SUM TOTAL OF GAYETY
I SHOULD BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO RE ENTER IT WHICH OF YOU HAS SEEN THE PLANET VENUS THE COQUETTE OF THE ABYSS THE CELIMENE OF THE OCEAN RISE IN THE INFINITE CALMING ALL HERE BELOW THE OCEAN IS A ROUGH ALCESTIS WELL GRUMBLE AS HE WILL
AND ALL BEING FINISHED COSETTE STILL COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WAS REAL SHE LOOKED AT MARIUS SHE LOOKED AT THE CROWD SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE FEARED THAT SHE SHOULD WAKE UP FROM HER DREAM
WHO THAT OLD COVE BELONGS TO AND WHERE THAT WEDDING PAIR LIVES I LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE QUEER IT'S SO EASY TO FIND OUT A WEDDING PARTY THAT PASSED THROUGH THE STREET ON A SHROVE TUESDAY A WEEK AFTERWARDS A PIN IN A HAY MOW
THESE TWO CHILDREN WERE TWO LILIES THEY DID NOT SEE EACH OTHER THEY DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EACH OTHER COSETTE PERCEIVED MARIUS IN THE MIDST OF A GLORY MARIUS PERCEIVED COSETTE ON AN ALTAR AND ON THAT ALTAR
MY CHILDREN RECEIVE AN OLD MAN'S BLESSING THE EVENING WAS GAY LIVELY AND AGREEABLE THE GRANDFATHER'S SOVEREIGN GOOD HUMOR GAVE THE KEY NOTE TO THE WHOLE FEAST AND EACH PERSON REGULATED HIS CONDUCT
IN THE MEANWHILE TWO OTHER MASKERS IN THE SAME CARRIAGE A SPANIARD WITH AN ENORMOUS NOSE AN ELDERLY AIR AND HUGE BLACK MOUSTACHE AND A GAUNT FISHWIFE WHO WAS QUITE A YOUNG GIRL
THAT HE WOULD COME TO MORROW HE HAS JUST TAKEN HIS DEPARTURE THAT EMPTY ARM CHAIR CHILLED THE EFFUSION OF THE WEDDING FEAST FOR A MOMENT BUT IF M FAUCHELEVENT WAS ABSENT
PROVIDED IT BE HONEST AND DECENT DOES HAPPINESS NO HARM AND THAT IN SHORT IT IS A GOOD AND A VENERABLE THING THAT THE FUSION OF THESE TWO DESTINIES WHENCE A FAMILY IS DESTINED TO SPRING SHOULD BEGIN AT HOME AND THAT THE HOUSEHOLD SHOULD THENCEFORTH
AND IRRECOVERABLE MOMENT AT THE DAZZLING INTERSECTION OF ALL YOUTH AND ALL JOY THEY REALIZED THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIRE THEY WERE FORTY YEARS OLD TAKEN TOGETHER IT WAS MARRIAGE SUBLIMATED
WHAT IS AN OBSCURE CORNER IN SUCH A SUBMERSION OF JOY COSETTE AND MARIUS WERE PASSING THROUGH
ALLOT TO THE BAILIFF OF THE PALACE TWENTY SOUS TOURNOIS FOR THREE COACHES OF MASCARADES IN THE CROSS ROADS IN OUR DAY THESE NOISY HEAPS OF CREATURES ARE ACCUSTOMED TO HAVE THEMSELVES DRIVEN IN SOME ANCIENT CUCKOO CARRIAGE WHOSE IMPERIAL THEY LOAD DOWN
ANY ONE IN THESE VEHICLES IS AT ONCE A SPECTATOR AND A SPECTACLE POLICE SERGEANTS MAINTAINED ON THE SIDES OF THE BOULEVARD THESE TWO INTERMINABLE PARALLEL FILES MOVING IN CONTRARY DIRECTIONS AND SAW TO IT THAT NOTHING INTERFERED WITH THAT DOUBLE CURRENT
DAZZLED WITH VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND BELIEVING THEMSELVES ALONE WERE TO LISTEN THEY WOULD HEAR IN THEIR CHAMBER A CONFUSED RUSTLING OF WINGS PERFECT HAPPINESS IMPLIES A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING WITH THE ANGELS THAT DARK LITTLE CHAMBER HAS ALL HEAVEN FOR ITS CEILING
THEIR UNHAPPINESS FORMED A HALO ROUND THEIR HAPPINESS THE LONG AGONY OF THEIR LOVE WAS TERMINATING IN AN ASCENSION IT WAS THE SAME ENCHANTMENT IN TWO SOULS
AND TO TAKE AWAY FROM US AND PUT BACK IN HIS BOX
ON THE WALLS SCONCES WITH TRIPLE AND QUINTUPLE BRANCHES MIRRORS SILVERWARE GLASSWARE PLATE PORCELAIN FAIENCE POTTERY GOLD AND SILVERSMITH'S WORK ALL WAS SPARKLING AND GAY
LET US BE HAPPY WITHOUT QUIBBLING AND QUIRKING LET US OBEY THE SUN BLINDLY WHAT IS THE SUN IT IS LOVE HE WHO SAYS LOVE SAYS WOMAN AH AH BEHOLD OMNIPOTENCE WOMEN
HONEST FAMILY COACHES LOADED DOWN WITH GREAT AUNTS AND GRANDMOTHERS DISPLAYED AT THEIR DOORS FRESH GROUPS OF CHILDREN IN DISGUISE CLOWNS OF SEVEN YEARS OF AGE COLUMBINES OF SIX RAVISHING LITTLE CREATURES WHO FELT THAT THEY FORMED AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE PUBLIC MIRTH
TO THE CHURCH OF SAINT PAUL AT THAT EPOCH
ON COMING OUT OF CHURCH OF HIDING ONESELF WITH SHAME FROM ONE'S HAPPINESS AND OF COMBINING THE WAYS OF A BANKRUPT WITH THE DELIGHTS OF THE SONG OF SONGS PEOPLE HAD NOT YET GRASPED TO THE FULL THE CHASTITY EXQUISITENESS
CAN YOU SEE THE BRIDE IF YOU STOOP DOWN NO AND THE BRIDEGROOM THERE'S NO BRIDEGROOM IN THAT TRAP BAH UNLESS IT'S THE OLD FELLOW TRY TO GET A SIGHT OF THE BRIDE BY STOOPING VERY LOW I CAN'T
THE MOST SACRED OF THE SOUVENIRS OF LIFE MINGLED PELL MELL WITH THE TETE A TETE OF THE CONDUCTOR OF THE DILIGENCE AND THE MAID SERVANT OF THE INN IN THIS SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN WHICH WE ARE NOW LIVING THE MAYOR AND HIS SCARF THE PRIEST
ADORE EACH OTHER AND SNAP YOUR FINGERS AT ALL THE REST BELIEVE WHAT I SAY TO YOU IT IS GOOD SENSE AND GOOD SENSE CANNOT LIE BE A RELIGION TO EACH OTHER EACH MAN HAS HIS OWN FASHION OF ADORING GOD
MARRIAGE WAS NOT CONDUCTED AT A FULL TROT STRANGE TO SAY AT THAT EPOCH PEOPLE STILL IMAGINED THAT A WEDDING WAS A PRIVATE AND SOCIAL FESTIVAL THAT A PATRIARCHAL BANQUET DOES NOT SPOIL A DOMESTIC SOLEMNITY THAT GAYETY EVEN IN EXCESS
THE FIRST INSPECTOR WHO GETS HIS EYE ON ME WILL ARREST ME YOU KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH YES I DO I'M BOUGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR TO DAY ALL THE SAME THAT OLD FELLOW BOTHERS ME DO THE OLD FELLOWS BOTHER YOU BUT YOU'RE NOT A YOUNG GIRL
SHE ONLY DEMANDS OF HER MASTERS WHEN SHE HAS MASTERS ONE THING PAINT ME THE MUD ROME WAS OF THE SAME MIND SHE LOVED NERO NERO WAS A TITANIC LIGHTERMAN
THEY BEHELD THE LIGHT OF A RISING SUN ALL AT ONCE THE CLOCK STRUCK MARIUS GLANCED AT COSETTE'S CHARMING BARE ARM AND AT THE ROSY THINGS WHICH WERE VAGUELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE LACE OF HER BODICE AND COSETTE
THE BREEZES OF FEBRUARY ARE NOT WARM AS THE FISHWIFE CLAD IN A LOW NECKED GOWN REPLIED TO THE SPANIARD SHE SHIVERED LAUGHED AND COUGHED HERE IS THEIR DIALOGUE SAY NOW WHAT DADDY
OATHS TO THE NORMAN HORSES WITH THEIR TAILS KNOTTED UP FALSE GALLOONS VARNISHED HAT LONG POWDERED LOCKS AN ENORMOUS WHIP AND TALL BOOTS FRANCE DOES NOT YET CARRY ELEGANCE TO THE LENGTH OF DOING LIKE THE ENGLISH NOBILITY

AND ARRANGED THEMSELVES IN THE PROPER ORDER AROUND THE TABLE TWO LARGE ARM CHAIRS FIGURED ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE BRIDE THE FIRST FOR M GILLENORMAND THE OTHER FOR JEAN VALJEAN
HE'S IN THE FIRST CARRIAGE WELL IN THE BRIDE'S TRAP WHAT THEN SO HE IS THE FATHER WHAT CONCERN IS THAT OF MINE I TELL YOU THAT HE'S THE FATHER AS IF HE WERE THE ONLY FATHER LISTEN
A NECKLACE OF FINE PEARLS A WREATH OF ORANGE FLOWERS ALL THIS WAS WHITE AND FROM THE MIDST OF THAT WHITENESS SHE BEAMED FORTH IT WAS AN EXQUISITE CANDOR EXPANDING AND BECOMING TRANSFIGURED IN THE LIGHT
YES WELL I'M SURE THAT I KNOW HIM AH I'M WILLING THAT THEY SHOULD CUT MY THROAT
SHE CARESSED HIM WITH HER SMILE A BANQUET HAD BEEN SPREAD IN THE DINING ROOM ILLUMINATION AS BRILLIANT AS THE DAYLIGHT IS THE NECESSARY SEASONING OF A GREAT JOY MIST AND OBSCURITY ARE NOT ACCEPTED BY THE HAPPY
TORMENTED WITH A BUTTERFLY SHOUTS DIRECTED AT PEDESTRIANS FISTS ON HIPS BOLD ATTITUDES BARE SHOULDERS IMMODESTY UNCHAINED A CHAOS OF SHAMELESSNESS DRIVEN BY A COACHMAN CROWNED WITH FLOWERS
COULD NOT GIVE HIS HAND TO THE BRIDE
THE POPULACE HAS THE MERRY ANDREW PARIS IS A GREAT MAD CITY ON EVERY OCCASION THAT IT IS A GREAT SUBLIME CITY THERE THE CARNIVAL FORMS PART OF POLITICS PARIS LET US CONFESS IT WILLINGLY ALLOWS INFAMY TO FURNISH IT WITH COMEDY
ASK THAT DEMAGOGUE OF A MARIUS IF HE IS NOT THE SLAVE OF THAT LITTLE TYRANT OF A COSETTE AND OF HIS OWN FREE WILL TOO THE COWARD WOMAN THERE IS NO ROBESPIERRE WHO KEEPS HIS PLACE BUT WOMAN REIGNS
OUGHT TO MAKE ITS ESCAPE THROUGH THE STONES OF THE WALLS IN BRILLIANCY AND VAGUELY ILLUMINATE THE GLOOM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THIS SACRED AND FATAL FESTIVAL SHOULD NOT GIVE OFF A CELESTIAL RADIANCE TO THE INFINITE LOVE IS THE SUBLIME CRUCIBLE
ALISON DID MIND BUT AFTER THE FIRST PANG OF DISAPPOINTMENT SHE SPOKE CHEERFULLY IT'S ALL RIGHT MISS HARLAND I'M SO THANKFUL TO BE HERE AT ALL I SHAN'T GRUMBLE AT ANYTHING
I TOOK THE LARGEST OF THE PIECES OF MEAT TIED IT CLOSE ROUND ME WITH THE CLOTH OF MY TURBAN AND THEN LAID MYSELF UPON THE GROUND WITH MY FACE DOWNWARD THE BAG OF DIAMONDS BEING MADE FAST TO MY GIRDLE
WHOSE GOLDEN HEAD AND APPLE BLOSSOM FACE SCARCELY SUGGESTED BOOKS OR SCHOLARSHIP THESE WITH ALISON KATHERINE AND JOAN MADE UP THE SEVEN KINDRED SPIRITS AN INFORMAL LITTLE CLUB OF LOYAL FRIENDS
AND SEEING PRESENTLY THAT SHE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP ALISON SLIPPED OUT OF THE ROOM ACROSS THE HALL TO THE ROOM OPPOSITE WHICH WAS KATHERINE BERTRAM'S KATHERINE WAS BETTER OFF FINANCIALLY THAN MOST OF THE GIRLS
BUT LOOKING OVER THE LAND I BEHELD SOMETHING WHITE
AND IN FLOCKED THE REST OF THE KINDRED SPIRIT EVELYN AND POLLY BOON COMPANIONS UNLIKE AS THEY WERE STUDIOUS RACHEL ROSALIND THE SCHOOL BEAUTY
HE HAD DISPLACED THE UNPLEASANT ONES WHICH CONSTANTLY STROVE FOR THE RIGHT OF POSSESSION HARD WORK AND NEW LOVE AND DAILY WEARYING OF THE BODY TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION HAD BANISHED THOSE PHANTOMS OF EARLIER YEARS SAVE IN HIS DREAMS
YES I SAW THEM THIS MORNING AS MUSICAL AS EVER OH IS THAT THE SUPPER BELL IT CAN'T BE SIX O'CLOCK ALREADY
IN SHORT THE BIRD ALIGHTED AND SAT OVER THE EGG AS I PERCEIVED HER COMING I CREPT CLOSE TO THE EGG SO THAT I HAD BEFORE ME ONE OF THE LEGS OF THE BIRD WHICH WAS AS BIG AS THE TRUNK OF A TREE
A NEW GIRL MARCIA WEST MARCIA THIS IS JOAN WENTWORTH WHO ROOMED WITH ME LAST YEAR JOAN SHOOK BACK HER LIGHT FLUFFY HAIR LOOKING RATHER TAKEN ABACK FOR AN INSTANT AS MARCIA EMERGED FROM THE CLOSET
AT FIRST I SUPPOSE THERE WON'T BE MUCH FOR ME TO DO I'LL HAVE TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE COMMUNITY BY LISTENING TO THE OLD LADIES SYMPTOMS THREE OR FOUR HOURS A DAY REGULARLY FINALLY THEY'LL LET ME VACCINATE THE KIDS AND THE REST WILL BE PITIFULLY EASY
I COULD NOT MODERATE MY JOY WHEN I FOUND MYSELF DELIVERED FROM THE DANGER I HAVE MENTIONED I THOUGHT MYSELF IN A DREAM AND COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE MYSELF OUT OF DANGER
AND HAD STREWED HER BELONGINGS ABOUT AS FREELY AS THOUGH SHE HAD EXPECTED TO OCCUPY THE ROOM ALONE IT WAS A FAIRLY GOOD SIZED ROOM CONTAINING TWO SINGLE BEDS AND A DRESSER CHAIR AND SMALL TABLE FOR EACH GIRL
BUT ALL THIS WAS IN VAIN
AND ADMIRED HIS SKILL BUT NO ONE LOVED HIM EXCEPT HIS SON AMONG ALL HIS ACQUAINTANCES THERE WAS NONE WHO CALLED HIM FRIEND EXCEPT AUSTIN THORPE THE OLD MINISTER WHO HAD BUT LATELY COME TO TOWN
TO TAKE AS MANY FOR HIS SHARE AS HE PLEASED HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH ONE AND THAT TOO THE LEAST OF THEM AND WHEN I PRESSED HIM TO TAKE MORE WITHOUT FEAR OF DOING ME ANY INJURY
AND FINALLY SET HER CHERISHED LAMP ON THE DRESSER SHE HAD SCARCELY FINISHED AND STOOD SURVEYING THE EFFECT WHEN THERE WAS A RUSH OF LITTLE FEET IN THE CORRIDOR THE DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND A SMALL ROSY FACED CURLY HAIRED GIRL RUSHED IN
BUT THEN SHE WAS NOT A NEW GIRL AND SHE KNEW THERE WERE MANY FRESHMEN LYING ON THEIR BEDS AT THIS MOMENT AND CRYING THEIR EYES OUT FOR HOMESICKNESS WELL IT WOULD NOT LAST LONG
I REALLY HAD NO OTHER PLACE FOR
MISS HARLAND SAID KISSING THE GIRL AFFECTIONATELY I WAS RATHER AFRAID FROM WHAT YOU WROTE SOME TIME AGO THAT YOU MIGHT NOT RETURN TO US THIS YEAR OH SO WAS I MISS HARLAND I WAS DREADFULLY AFRAID OF IT
BUT DID NOT ENTIRELY CONCEAL THOSE FINE LINES ABOUT THE MOUTH WHICH MEAN CRUELTY SOMEWAY IN LOOKING AT HIM ONE GOT THE IMPRESSION OF A MACHINE WELL NIGH PERFECT OF ITS KIND HIS DARK EYES WERE SHARP AND PENETRATING
SHE REACHED HER DOOR AND TAPPED LIGHTLY IT WAS OPENED AFTER AN INSTANT'S DELAY AND THE NEW GIRL STOOD THERE IN SILENCE STILL HOLDING THE DOOR AND LOOKING AT HER WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH IF NOT EXACTLY FORBIDDING
I UPBRAIDED MYSELF A HUNDRED TIMES FOR NOT BEING CONTENT WITH THE PRODUCE OF MY FIRST VOYAGE
SO CHEER UP JO IT WON'T BE SO BAD THEY FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION OF SCHOOL MATTERS WHICH WAS PRESENTLY INTERRUPTED BY A TUMULTUOUS RUSH OUTSIDE THE DOOR WAS OPENED WITHOUT CEREMONY
THEIR FAVORITE GATHERING PLACE LAST YEAR HAD BEEN THE ROOM OCCUPIED BY ALISON AND JOAN AND CONSTERNATION REIGNED WHEN THE NEWS SPREAD THAT THE NEWCOMER HAD USURPED JOAN'S PLACE
WHILE SOME DIVERTED THEMSELVES WITH GATHERING FLOWERS AND OTHERS FRUITS I TOOK MY WINE AND PROVISIONS AND SAT DOWN NEAR A STREAM BETWIXT TWO HIGH TREES WHICH FORMED A THICK SHADE
ONLY HANGING UP A FEW DRESSES AND LEAVING THE REST IN HER TRUNK SHE PLACED A FEW FAVORITE BOOKS BETWEEN A PAIR OF BRONZE BOOKENDS HER FATHER'S PARTING GIFT LAID HER BIBLE BESIDE THEM AND HER PRETTY NEW PORTFOLIO HER MOTHER HAD GIVEN HER
THIS IN ITSELF WAS NO DISTINCTION FOR THORPE WAS THE FRIEND OF EVERY MAN WOMAN CHILD AND ANIMAL IN THE VILLAGE NO TWO MEN COULD HAVE BEEN MORE UNLIKE BUT FRIENDSHIP LIKE LOVE IS OFTEN A MATTER OF CHEMICAL AFFINITY WHEREIN OPPOSITES RUSH TOGETHER IN OBEDIENCE TO A HIDDEN LAW
THE BLACK FIGURE IN THE GARDEN WITH THE CHIFFON FLUTTERING ABOUT ITS HEAD WAS EVELINA GREY OR WHAT WAS LEFT OF HER
OR I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO MISS HARLAND AND TRIED TO GET ONE OF THE OLD GIRLS TO CHANGE WITH HER OH WELL IT'S ONLY THE FIRST DAY MAYBE SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN OR WE MAY LIKE HER BETTER WHEN WE KNOW HER SAID ALISON HOPEFULLY
ONCE THEY HAD BEEN SYMPATHETIC BUT HE HAD OUTGROWN THAT HIS HANDS WERE LARGE WHITE AND WELL KEPT HIS FINGERS KNOTTED AND BLUNT AT THE TIPS HE HAD PRE EMINENTLY THE HAND OF THE SURGEON CAPABLE OF SWIFTNESS AND STRENGTH
ALL READY TO HANG UP ON THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE BESIDE YOURS I'LL BE GLAD TO GET OUT OF THE GRIND FOR A WHILE I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'VE WORKED AS HIS SATANIC MAJESTY UNDOUBTEDLY DOES WHEN HE RECEIVES WORD THAT A FRESH BATCH OF MORMONS HAS HIT THE TRAIL FOR THE GOOD INTENTIONS PAVEMENT
EACH HALL BEING PRESIDED OVER BY A TEACHER IN THESE PLEASANT COURTS OF LEARNING ALISON FAIR ARRIVED ON A GOLDEN SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON AND WAS WARMLY WELCOMED BY MISS HARLAND THE PRINCIPAL
AT NIGHT THE SOUL CLAIMS ITS OWN ITS RIGHT TO SUFFER FOR ITS SECRET SINS ITS SHIRKING ITS BETRAYALS IT IS NOT PLEASANT FOR A MAN TO BE BRANDED IN HIS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS A COWARD
BY RIGID SELF DISCIPLINE HE HAD WHOLLY MASTERED HIMSELF HIS DETACHMENT FROM HIS KIND WAS AT FIRST SPASMODIC THEN EXCEPTIONALLY COMPLETE EXCEPTING RALPH HIS RELATION TO THE WORLD WAS THAT OF AN UNIMPASSIONED CRITIC
YOU WILL TREAT ME REPLIED I WITH MORE CIVILITY WHEN YOU KNOW ME BETTER DO NOT BE UNEASY I HAVE DIAMONDS ENOUGH FOR YOU AND MYSELF MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER MERCHANTS TOGETHER WHATEVER THEY HAVE THEY OWE TO CHANCE BUT I SELECTED FOR MYSELF
MISS HARLAND TOLD ME YOU WERE HERE I'M SORRY TO BE LATE I HOPE YOU LIKE OUR ROOM PRETTY
ONE WAS A GIRL OF TWENTY LAUGHING EXQUISITELY LOVELY THE OTHER WAS A BENT AND BROKEN WOMAN IN BLACK WHOSE VEIL CONCEALED THE DREADFUL HIDEOUSNESS OF HER FACE PSHAW GRUMBLED DOCTOR DEXTER ALOUD
HE WAS SO SURE OF HIS OWN GROUND THAT HE THOUGHT HE CONSIDERED RALPH IMPERSONALLY ALSO OVER A NATURE WHICH AT THE BEGINNING WAS WARMLY HUMAN DOCTOR DEXTER HAD LAID THIS GLACIAL MASK HE DID WHAT HE HAD TO DO WITH NEATNESS AND DISPATCH
DOCTOR DEXTER'S OWN ALMA MATER HE HAD NOT BEEN AT HOME SINCE HE ENTERED THE SCHOOL HAVING UNDERTAKEN TO DO IN THREE YEARS THE WORK WHICH USUALLY REQUIRED FOUR HE WROTE FREQUENTLY HOWEVER AND DOCTOR DEXTER INVARIABLY WENT TO THE POST OFFICE HIMSELF
AND YET OF DELICACY IT WAS NOT A HAND THAT WOULD TREMBLE EASILY IT WAS POWERFUL AND IN A WAY BRUTAL HE WAS THOROUGHLY SELF SATISFIED AS WELL HE MIGHT BE FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRYSIDE ADMITTED HIS SKILL
AND THE DOCTOR REFLECTED THAT WHEN RALPH CAME THORPE WOULD BE LONELY THE DEXTER HOUSE WAS AN OLD ONE BUT IT HAD BEEN KEPT IN GOOD REPAIR FROM TIME TO TIME
THIS WAS A NEW PERPLEXITY
I MADE A GOOD MEAL AND AFTERWARD FELL ASLEEP I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG I SLEPT BUT WHEN I AWOKE THE SHIP WAS GONE IN THIS SAD CONDITION I WAS READY TO DIE WITH GRIEF
I WAS MUCH ASTONISHED AT THIS SUDDEN DARKNESS BUT MUCH MORE WHEN I FOUND IT OCCASIONED BY A BIRD OF A MONSTROUS SIZE THAT CAME FLYING TOWARD ME
SAID ALISON CONSULTING HER WRIST WATCH AND FINDING IT CORRESPOND WITH THE BELL I MUST GO AND SEE IF MY ROOMMATE IS AWAKE AND TAKE HER DOWN TO SUPPER PLEASE BE NICE TO HER GIRLS I DON'T KNOW YET WHETHER SHE IS CROSS OR JUST SHY
HIS REASON WAS FULLY SATISFIED WITH THE PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION BUT HE WAS NOT A MAN WHO WAS LIKELY TO HAVE AN HALLUCINATION OF ANY SORT HE WAS STRONG AND STRAIGHT OF BODY FINELY MUSCULAR AND DID NOT LOOK OVER FORTY
ON THE DAYS RALPH'S LETTERS WERE EXPECTED HE HAD THE ENTIRE CORRESPONDENCE ON FILE AND WHILED AWAY MANY A LONELY EVENING
AND ITS BRANCHES SO THICK THAT ONE HUNDRED MEN MAY EASILY SIT UNDER ITS SHADE THE JUICE OF WHICH THE CAMPHIRE IS MADE EXUDES FROM A HOLE BORED IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TREE AND IS RECEIVED
KIDS ALWAYS LIKE ME FOR SOME OCCULT REASON
AND IN THE MEAN TIME JOAN IS WELCOME WITH ME AS LONG AS SHE LIKES I'LL ASK FOR A COT FOR HER THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM SAID KATHERINE HOSPITABLY WE SHALL BE CLOSE BY AND CAN GET TOGETHER WHENEVER WE LIKE
THE BREAKFAST BELL RANG AGAIN AND DOCTOR DEXTER WENT DOWNSTAIRS THE SERVANT MET HIM IN THE HALL BREAKFAST IS WAITING SIR SHE SAID ALL RIGHT RETURNED THE DOCTOR ABSENTLY
BUT MARCIA SEEMED TO HAVE NO ENTHUSIASMS SHE HAD COME TO SCHOOL BECAUSE SHE WAS MADE TO AND SHE LOOKED FORWARD TO NOTHING BUT GETTING THROUGH FINALLY SHE SAID SHE WAS TIRED AND LAY DOWN ON HER BED
I FOUND THAT I HAD GAINED NOTHING BY THE CHANGE AS I WALKED THROUGH THIS VALLEY I PERCEIVED IT WAS STREWED WITH DIAMONDS SOME OF WHICH WERE OF SURPRISING BIGNESS I TOOK PLEASURE IN LOOKING UPON THEM BUT SHORTLY
WHOSE SPACIOUS ROOMS WERE NOW USED AS PARLORS LIBRARY OFFICES AND TEACHERS ROOMS THERE WERE WIDE BEAUTIFUL PORCHES IN FRONT AND BACK AND MASSIVE STONE STEPS
AND EVEN IN THE OPERATING ROOMS OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE CITY NOT FAR DISTANT DOCTOR DEXTER'S NAME WAS WELL KNOWN HE HAD THOUGHT SERIOUSLY AT TIMES OF SEEKING A WIDER FIELD BUT HE LIKED THE COUNTRY AND THE OPEN AIR AND HIS PRACTICE WOULD GIVE RALPH THE OPPORTUNITY HE NEEDED
IF AN OPERATION WAS NECESSARY HE SAID SO AT ONCE NOT TROUBLING HIMSELF TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT GRADUALLY IF THERE WAS DOUBT AS TO THE OUTCOME HE WOULD CHEERFULLY ADVISE THE PATIENT TO MAKE A WILL FIRST BUT THERE WAS SELDOM DOUBT
IT WAS PRETTILY FURNISHED AND HER PICTURES AND RUGS WERE BETTER AND MORE LUXURIOUS THAN MOST SCHOOLGIRLS ROOMS COULD BOAST NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS KNOWN AS A GOOD FELLOW AND WAS POPULAR WITH THE GIRLS
AFTER HAVING EATEN A LITTLE MORE OF MY PROVISIONS BUT I HAD SCARCELY SHUT MY EYES WHEN SOMETHING
THE BROADLY HUMAN CREED OF THE MINISTER INCLUDED EVERY LIVING THING AND THE MAN HIMSELF INTERESTED DOCTOR DEXTER IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT A NEW SLIDE FOR HIS MICROSCOPE MIGHT INTEREST HIM THEY EXCHANGED VISITS FREQUENTLY WHEN THE DUTIES OF BOTH PERMITTED
NORDSTETTEN WUERTEMBERG EIGHTEEN TWELVE AUERBACH DRIFTED FROM PREPARATION FOR THE SYNAGOGUE TOWARD LAW PHILOSOPHY AND LITERATURE THE STUDY OF SPINOZA WHOSE WORKS HE TRANSLATED
WITH HIS RIGHT ARM RESTING ON HIS KNEE AND HIS CHIN UPON HIS HAND HE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY HE UNDERSTOOD LITTLE OF THE SERMON BUT HIS EYES HUNG UPON THE PREACHER'S LIPS AND HIS MIND FOLLOWED HIS INTENTIONS
WHILE OTHERS PASSED OUT WITH EMPTY BOWLS UNDER THEIR ARMS THEY NODDED TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT SPEAKING THEY HAD BROUGHT WEDDING PRESENTS FOR THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN WHO WAS TO BE MARRIED TO HIS BRIDE THE CHURCH
EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AFTERWARD SUPPLEMENTED WITH EIN DENKERLEBEN A THINKER'S LIFE DICHTER UND KAUFMAN POET AND MERCHANT EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE STORIES BELONGING TO THE GHETTO SERIES
WITHOUT BEING STRUCK WITH BLINDNESS THE CHAPLAIN OF HORB NOW ENTERED THE PULPIT AND SOLEMNLY ADDRESSED THE PERMITIANT THEN THE LATTER TOOK HIS PLACE
HE DIED AT CANNES FRANCE IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO ON THE HEIGHTS IS DOUBTLESS AUERBACH'S BEST REPRESENTATIVE THE VILLA ON THE RHINE IS IN A LOWER KEY WITH LESS APPEALING TYPES
ALL THE WORLD LOOKED AS EXULTINGLY QUIET AND GLAD
AND ONLY COVERED HIS HEAD WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET SOGES HAD A NEW SWORD BRIGHTLY JAPANNED AND GLITTERING IN THE SUN THE SQUIRE'S WIFE SOON FOLLOWED
THEY RANK AMONG THE AUTHOR'S MOST PLEASING AND SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTIONS STAMPED AS THEY ARE WITH THAT TRUTH WHICH A WRITER LIKE AUERBACH OR A PAINTER LIKE DEFREGGER OR SCHMIDT
MEANING THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN WHO IN HIS GOLD LACED ROBE AND BARE HEAD CROWNED WITH A GOLDEN WREATH ASCENDED THE STEPS OF THE ALTAR WITH PALE AND SOBER MIEN
CAN EXPRESS WHEN SITTING DOWN TO DEAL WITH THE SCENES AND FOLK WHICH FROM EARLY YOUTH HAVE BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED UPON HIS HEART AND MEMORY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX THERE FOLLOWED IN THE SAME DESCRIPTIVE FIELD HIS
AND THE ADJOINING FIELDS AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH
TOOK THE LEAD CARRYING THE CRUCIFIX ON THE HILL THE ALTAR WAS FINELY DECORATED THE CHALICES AND THE LAMPS AND THE SPANGLED DRESSES OF THE SAINTS FLASHED IN THE SUN AND THE THRONG OF WORSHIPERS COVERED THE COMMON
I WISH I WAS IN HOCHDORF WHY BECAUSE IT'S SO NEAR TO HEAVEN AND I SHOULD LIKE TO CLIMB UP ONCE YOU SILLY BOY IT ONLY SEEMS AS IF HEAVEN BEGAN THERE
LEADING HER DAUGHTER BARBARA WHO WAS BUT SIX YEARS OLD BY THE HAND BARBARA WAS DRESSED IN BRIDAL ARRAY SHE WORE THE VEIL AND THE WREATH UPON HER HEAD AND A BEAUTIFUL GOWN
THE CLOSE OF HIS LIFE WAS MUCH EMBITTERED BY THE GROWTH OF THE ANTI SEMITIC
CHRISTIAN THE TAILOR AND HIS WIFE CAME DOWN THE COVERED STAIRS OF THE CHURCH HILL IN SUPERIOR BLISS ORDINARILY THEY ATTRACTED LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE VILLAGE BUT ON THIS OCCASION ALL CROWDED AROUND THEM
IF NOT HIS THOUGHTS WHEN THE PROCESSION RETURNED TO THE CHURCH AMID THE RENEWED PEAL OF THE BELLS AND TRIUMPHANT STRAINS OF MUSIC
OFFERS TOO MANY TYPES TO STUDY AND INTERESTS TO FOLLOW AND BETRAYS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN ITS CONSTRUCTION BUT IN SPITE OF ALL ITS DEFECTS IT IS A NOVEL THAT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN
AMID THE RINGING OF ALL THE BELLS THE PROCESSION AT LAST ISSUED FROM THE CHURCH DOOR THE PENNONS WAVED THE BAND OF MUSIC BROUGHT FROM HORB STRUCK UP
IN BLACK FOREST VILLAGE STORIES ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON THE BUSY SOUND OF HAMMER AND ADZE WAS HEARD ON THE GREEN HILL TOP WHICH SERVED THE GOOD FOLKS OF NORDSTETTEN
IS GENUINELY HUMAN THE STORY OF HER ABRUPT ATONEMENT FOR A LAPSE FROM HER BETTER SELF THE GRADUAL PROCESS OF HER FANTASTIC EXPIATION AND OF HER SELF REDEMPTION
AND WAS FOLLOWED BY WALDFRIED A LONG PATRIOTIC AND ON THE WHOLE INERT STUDY OF A GERMAN FAMILY FROM EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT UNTIL THE CLOSE OF THE FRANCO PRUSSIAN WAR
BUT WITH AUF DER HOEHE ON THE HEIGHTS A PHILOSOPHIC ROMANCE OF COURT LIFE IN THE CAPITAL AND THE ROYAL COUNTRY SEAT OF A CONSIDERABLE GERMAN KINGDOM BY NO MEANS MERELY IMAGINARY
LITTLE BAREFOOT JOSEPH IM SCHNEE JOSEPH IN THE SNOW EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND EDELWEISS EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE HIS WRITINGS OF THIS DATE
WITH BUTTONS WHICH HE TOOK FOR SILVER AND A NEWLY WASHED PAIR OF LEATHERN BREECHES HE WAS TO CARRY THE CRUCIFIX GRETCHEN IVO'S ELDEST SISTER TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND LED HIM INTO THE STREET
WITH THE GREATEST REVERENCE TO PRESENT THEIR CONGRATULATIONS THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN'S MOTHER RETURNED THANKS WITH TEARFUL EYES
OR TO RAKE THE CHIPS INTO A HEAP
THE AUTHOR OF BLACK FOREST VILLAGE STORIES AND ON THE HEIGHTS STANDS OUT IN HONORABLE INDIVIDUALITY AMONG MODERN GERMAN NOVELISTS
WAS HERE EXHIBITED AT ITS BEST HE NEVER AGAIN SHOWED THE SAME FORCE OF CONCEPTION WHICH GOT HIS IMPERFECT LITERARY ART FORGIVEN
NEXT MORNING A CLEAR BRIGHT DAY ROSE UPON THE VILLAGE
THE ELEMENT WHICH GIVES THE BOOK ITS FORCE OFFER MUCH THAT IS CONSISTENT AND APPEALING AND ELEVATING TO THE CONSCIENCE AUERBACH
AS THE VESPER BELL RANG VALENTINE RELEASED THE HAND OF HIS SON WHO QUICKLY FOLDED HIS HANDS VALENTINE ALSO BROUGHT HIS HANDS TOGETHER OVER HIS HEAVY TOOLS AND SAID AN AVE
GAVE FORM TO HIS CONVICTIONS CONCERNING HUMAN LIFE IT LED HIM TO SPEND HIS LITERARY TALENTS ON MATERIALS SO VARIOUS AS THE HOMELY SIMPLICITY OF PEASANT SCENES AND PEASANT SOULS ON THE ONE HAND
TALES SKETCHES JOURNALISTIC POLITICAL AND DRAMATIC AND OTHER PAPERS REVEAL AUERBACH'S VARYING MOODS OR ENTHUSIASMS CHRONICLE HIS RESIDENCE IN DIFFERENT GERMAN OR AUSTRIAN CITIES
AS AN IMMACULATE VIRGIN SHE WAS INTENDED TO REPRESENT THE BRIDE OF THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN THE CHURCH AT THE FIRST SOUND OF THE BELL THE PEOPLE IN SHIRT SLEEVES DISAPPEARED AS IF BY MAGIC
HALF DRESSED FOR THE FESTIVAL HAVING NO COATS ON
HE WROTE VOLUMINOUSLY AND WAS WIDELY POPULAR TO BE HALF FORGOTTEN WITHIN A DECADE AFTER HIS DEATH HE MAY PERHAPS BE RECKONED THE FOUNDER OF A CONTEMPORARY GERMAN SCHOOL OF TENDENZ NOVEL WRITERS
THROUGH THE DELIBERATE SACRIFICE OF ALL THAT BELONGS TO HER TREACHEROUS PAST HER SUCCESSFUL STRUGGLE INTO A HIGH ETHICAL LIFE AND KNOWLEDGE OF HERSELF
SO AS TO HAVE ROOM IN THE HOUSE HAVING ENJOINED UPON HIM BY NO MEANS TO GO BACK SHE RETURNED HASTILY WHEREVER HE CAME HE FOUND THE MEN STANDING IN KNOTS IN THE ROAD THEY WERE BUT
THE TRANSLATION IN FIVE VOLUMES OF SPINOZA'S PHILOSOPHY WITH A CRITICAL BIOGRAPHY EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE AND IN EIGHTEEN FORTY TWO ANOTHER WORK INTENDED TO POPULARIZE PHILOSOPHY
WAGON AFTER WAGON RUMBLED IN BRINGING FARMERS AND FARMERS WIVES FROM ABROAD AT THE HOUSES PEOPLE WELCOMED THEM AND BROUGHT CHAIRS TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING DOWN
THEN LET IT BE SO BUT MISS CLAVERING I SHALL NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE TILL YOU HAVE SAID MORE THAN THAT AND I WILL SPEAK THE TRUTH TO YOU EVEN THOUGH IT MAY OFFEND YOU I HAVE MORE OF HOPE NOW THAN I HAVE EVER HAD BEFORE
I HAVE LOVED HER JUST AS IF SHE WERE MY OWN OF COURSE I LOOK NOW FOR THE OBEDIENCE OF A CHILD SHE DOES NOT MEAN TO BE UNDUTIFUL MICHEL I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT MEANING I LIKE REALITY AND I WILL HAVE IT TOO
NEVER MIND THAT TO NIGHT MARIE O YES I WILL GO DOWN PRESENTLY I SHOULD NOT BE HAPPY IF THE THINGS WERE NOT PUT STRAIGHT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT THE HOUSE EVERYWHERE
SHE SAT THERE THINKING OF IT TILL THE NIGHT WAS HALF SPENT AND WHEN SHE CREPT UP COLD TO BED SHE HAD ALMOST MADE UP HER MIND THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR HER TO DO AS HER UNCLE WISHED AS FOR LOVING THE MAN THAT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
BUT THE WEAKNESS WAS NOT OF THAT NATURE AND HE HAD FAILED THEN HAD COME THE RIVALRY BETWEEN MOUNTJOY AND HARRY WHICH HAD SEEMED TO AUGUSTUS TO BE THE EXTREME OF IMPUDENCE FROM OF OLD HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO REGARD HIS BROTHER MOUNTJOY AS THE FIRST OF YOUNG MEN
BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF THAT MIGHT I HOPE SHE VENTURED FOR AN INSTANT TO GLANCE AT HIS FACE AND SAW THAT HIS EYES WERE GLISTENING WITH A WONDERFUL BRIGHTNESS HOW CAN I ANSWER YOU FURTHER
SHE DID NOT DO SO SHE SIMPLY BADE ME ASK YOURSELF AND SHE WAS RIGHT ON SUCH A MATTER THERE IS NO ONE TO WHOM I CAN WITH PROPRIETY ADDRESS MYSELF BUT TO YOURSELF THEREFORE I NOW ASK YOU THE QUESTION
BUT MARIE BROMAR ENTERTAINED NO GENTLE THOUGHT RESPECTING HIM HE WAS NOT WANTED THERE AND HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE COME
DOES SHE THINK SOME COUNT FROM PARIS IS TO COME AND FETCH HER NAY MICHEL I THINK SHE EXPECTS NOTHING OF THAT SORT
I AM NOT CROSS AUNT JOSEY I WENT ON JUST THE SAME AS I ALWAYS DO
AS HER AUNT'S SUSPICION THAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR HIS RETURN IT WAS NOT THAT SHE HAD BEEN DESERTED BUT THAT OTHERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAUNT HER WITH HER DESOLATION
UPON MY WORD AND HONOUR I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHAT IT IS THAT SHE WANTS I CAN'T INDEED IT WAS PERHAPS THE FAULT OF MICHEL VOSS THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN SHOULD LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM AND HAVE A WANT WHICH HE DID NOT CONCEIVE
ON THE NEXT MORNING SEPTIMUS JONES TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND ON THE DAY FOLLOWING AUGUSTUS FOLLOWED HIM
BETWEEN YOU AND ME I THINK HE MEANS TO INTERFERE WITH ME AND I DO NOT MEAN TO STAND HIS INTERFERENCE I SHOULD THINK NOT HE MUST GO BACK TO BUSTON AMONG THE BUSTONIANS OR HE AND I WILL HAVE A STAND UP FIGHT OF IT
I HAVE MY EYES OPEN AND CAN SEE AS WELL AS ANOTHER WHEN HARRY LECTURES ME ABOUT MY FATHER AND MY FATHER ABOUT ME
AND HOW FLAX WAS LIKELY TO BE DEARER THAN EVER HE HAD SEEN IT AND HOW THE TRAVELLING ENGLISH WERE FEWER THIS YEAR THAN USUAL TO THE GREAT DETRIMENT OF THE INNKEEPERS
I CARE NOTHING FOR GEORGE SAID MARIE AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM NOTHING AT ALL NOTHING ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LISTENING AT HER OWN DOOR SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF HER UNCLE'S FEET AS HE WENT TO HIS ROOM AND KNEW THAT THE HOUSE WAS QUIET
THERE IS NOT ONE WHO CAN SAY THAT HE HAS EVEN A VERBAL PROMISE FROM ME THEY NEVER CAME TO ME WHEN THEY WANTED TO LEND HIM MONEY AT FIFTY PER CENT DID THEY EVER HEAR ME SAY THAT HE WAS MY HEIR PERHAPS NOT NOT ONE HAS EVER HEARD IT
SCARBOROUGH HAD KNOWN HARRY ANNESLEY FOR A LONG TIME AS TIME IS COUNTED IN EARLY YOUTH AND HAD BY DEGREES LEARNED TO HATE HIM THOROUGHLY
BUT IT IS MY ONE GREAT HOPE AS REGARDS THIS WORLD THAT I SHOULD HAVE YOU AT SOME FUTURE DAY AS MY OWN IT MAY BE THAT I AM TOO PRONE TO HOPE BUT SURELY IF THAT WERE ALTOGETHER BEYOND HOPE
FOR THE INNKEEPER HAD BROUGHT FORTH A BOTTLE OF HIS BEST BURGUNDY IN HONOUR OF THE OCCASION WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR FRUIT MADAME VOSS LEFT THE ROOM AND MICHEL AND ADRIAN WERE SOON ALONE TOGETHER SAY NOTHING TO HER TILL TO MORROW SAID MICHEL IN A LOW VOICE
NOW SCARBOROUGH YOU MAY AS WELL TAKE IT ONCE FOR ALL THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE TALKED DOWN IF YOU WANT TO TALK A FELLOW DOWN YOU CAN GO TO WALKER BROWN OR GREEN THEN WHEN YOU ARE TIRED OF THE OCCUPATION YOU CAN COME BACK TO ME
WE HOWEVER MAY DECLARE THAT THAT INCLINATION TO RIDICULE HIS PASSION TO THINK OF HIM AS A MAN WHO HAD NO RIGHT TO LOVE WAS GONE FOREVER SHE CONCEDED TO HIM CLEARLY THAT RIGHT
IT IS LIKE A FIRST LOVE WITH SOME PEOPLE A FIRST LOVE WILL COME SO STRONGLY THAT IT MAKES A RENEWAL OF THE PASSION IMPOSSIBLE HE DID NOT SAY THAT IT WOULD BE SO WITH HIMSELF BUT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT HE INTENDED THAT SHE SHOULD SO UNDERSTAND HIM
FANNY WAS NOW A LITTLE CONFUSED SO THAT SHE COULD NOT EXACTLY CALCULATE WHAT ALL THIS MEANT MISTER SAUL WALKED ON BY HER SIDE AND FOR SOME MOMENTS NOTHING WAS SAID
MADAME VOSS IN OBEDIENCE TO HER HUSBAND'S COMMANDS WENT UP TO MARIE AND FOUND HER SITTING IN THE CHILDREN'S ROOM LEANING WITH HER HEAD ON HER HAND AND HER ELBOW ON THE TABLE WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP AROUND HER
HAS HE NOW AND I DON'T MEAN TO SPARE HIM I SHOULD THINK NOT THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE AT THE END OF WHICH JONES FOUND HIMSELF DRIVEN TO ASK A QUESTION HOW HAS HE LIED
WE NEED NOT TALK ABOUT THAT JUST AT PRESENT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE MADE UP MY MIND AT ANY RATE I DO NOT INTEND THAT HARRY ANNESLEY SHALL HAVE HER I SHOULD THINK NOT
IF I WERE STRONG THERE WOULD BE NO SUCH NEED BUT I AM WEAK WEAK IN THIS AND I COULD NOT HOLD MYSELF UNDER SUCH CONTROL AS IS WANTED FOR THE WORK I HAVE TO DO WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN OF HIS LOVE FOR THE PLACE FOR THE PARISH
AUGUSTUS HAS HIS OWN DOUBTS THAT'S AN IMPERTINENT YOUNG PUPPY SAID SEPTIMUS JONES AS SOON AS THE FLY WHICH WAS TO CARRY HARRY ANNESLEY TO THE STATION HAD LEFT THE HALL DOOR ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
BECAUSE THERE'S A TELEGRAPH WIRE FROM TRETTON TO LONDON AND BECAUSE THE JOURNEY DOWN HERE IS VERY SHORT IT ALSO OCCURS TO ME TO THINK SO FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID BY SIR WILLIAM BRODRICK OF COURSE ANY MAN MAY DIE SUDDENLY
AFTER A WHILE HE RECURRED AGAIN TO HIS PARTING FROM FLORENCE I ASKED HER ADVICE ON THAT OCCASION AND SHE GAVE IT ME CLEARLY WITH A CLEAR PURPOSE AND AN ASSURED VOICE
YOUR UNCLE WON'T BE UP YET THEN SHE LED THE WAY AND MARIE FOLLOWED HER YOUR UNCLE IS BECOMING ANGRY MARIE BECAUSE BECAUSE WHY HAVE I DONE ANYTHING TO MAKE HIM ANGRY
HE WAS DOWN UPON YOU AND DOWN UPON YOUR FATHER OF COURSE YOUR FATHER HAS MADE A MOST FRAUDULENT ATTEMPT BUT WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT TO HIM THE OTHER YOUNG MAN MADE NO ANSWER BUT ONLY SMILED
IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DAILY DUTY THERE WERE ENTRIES TO BE MADE AND FIGURES TO BE ADJUSTED WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN DRIVEN UPSTAIRS BY FEAR OF HER LOVER AND HER UNCLE BUT BY THE TIME THAT SHE TOOK HERSELF UP TO BED
DOES IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT YOU MAY NEVER SEE ME AGAIN WHAT A QUESTION IT'S ONE THAT REQUIRES AN ANSWER AT ANY RATE IT DOES OCCUR TO ME BUT NOT AT ALL AS PROBABLE WHY NOT PROBABLE
AT THIS TIME MARIE WAS UP STAIRS WITH THE CHILDREN RESOLUTE THAT NOTHING SHOULD INDUCE HER TO GO DOWN TILL SHE SHOULD BE SURE THAT THEIR VISITOR HAD GONE TO HIS CHAMBER
HE FELT THAT IT BEHOVED HIM TO DO HIS BEST AND HE DID IT HE TALKED FREELY TO MADAME VOSS TELLING HER THE NEWS FROM BASLE
WELL YES I SUPPOSE SO A MAN HAS GOT SO MANY THINGS TO LOOK AFTER WHICH HE CAN'T ATTEND TO DOWN HERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BUT YOU UNDERSTAND IT ALL I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO STAY
SHE DID NOT TELL YOU OF MY HAVING PARTED WITH HER THEN NOT ESPECIALLY THAT I REMEMBER AH YOU WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED IF SHE HAD TOLD YOU BUT SHE WAS QUITE RIGHT NOT TO TELL YOU
AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH HAD MADE UP HIS MIND LOOKING AT THE MATTER ALL ROUND THAT MORE WAS TO BE GOT BY ABUSING HARRY THAN BY PRAISING HIM THE YOUNG MAN HAS A GOOD OPINION OF HIMSELF CERTAINLY
AND THAT SHE WAS PERHAPS UNACCOUNTABLY AVERSE TO THE IDEA OF MATRIMONY SHE IS LIKE A YOUNG FILLY YOU KNOW THAT STARTS AND PLUNGES WHEN SHE IS TOUCHED HE HAD SAID YOU THINK THERE IS NOBODY ELSE URMAND HAD ASKED
IF SO IT IS FALSE WHOEVER SAYS IT I HAVE DONE NOTHING HE HAS GONE AWAY AND LET HIM STAY I SHALL NOT SEND FOR HIM UNCLE MICHEL NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF ME BECAUSE OF GEORGE
POOR MARIE ALL THAT SHE WANTED NOW AT THIS MOMENT WAS TO BE LET ALONE
SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO SAY TO HIM ANY WORD THAT SHOULD BANISH HIM FOREVER FROM THE PLACE HE LOVED SO WELL IF YOU KNOW YOUR OWN HEART WELL ENOUGH TO ANSWER ME YOU SHOULD DO SO HE WENT ON TO SAY IF YOU DO NOT SAY SO
I THINK HE'LL FIND THAT THE GARMENT IS NOT ALTOGETHER WATER TIGHT THEN AUGUSTUS FINDING THAT HE HAD TOLD AS MUCH AS WAS NEEDFUL TO SEPTIMUS JONES LEFT HIS FRIEND AND WENT ABOUT HIS OWN FAMILY BUSINESS
I WILL NOT SAID ADRIAN I DO NOT WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF FACE IF SHE KNOWS WHY I HAVE COME OF COURSE SHE KNOWS GIVE HER TO NIGHT AND TO MORROW AND WE WILL SEE HOW IT IS TO BE
YOU ARE WRONG THERE THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO NOR SHOULD THEY THOUGH I WERE AS STRONG AS YOU WHAT ARE MOUNTJOY'S CREDITORS TO ME THEY HAVE NOT A SCRAP OF MY HANDWRITING IN THEIR POSSESSION
NOTHING SHE DECLARED TO HERSELF WAS MEANER THAN A MAN WHO WOULD GO TO A GIRL'S PARENTS OR GUARDIANS FOR SUPPORT
AND AS HE SPOKE THERE CERTAINLY WERE NO SMILES ON HIS OWN I SUPPOSE SHE IS FLURRIED SAID MADAME VOSS AH FLURRIED THAT MAY DO FOR TO NIGHT I HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD TO HER HAD SHE BEEN MY OWN I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN KINDER
IT WAS THUS THAT ANNESLEY HAD BEEN WONT TO ADDRESS HIS FRIEND BUT HIS FRIEND HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO TALK DOWN THIS SPECIAL YOUNG MAN FOR SPECIAL PURPOSES AND HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF SOME WEAKNESS IN THE OTHER'S CHARACTER WHICH HE THOUGHT ENTITLED HIM TO DO SO
BUT AFTERWARD WITH THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING WHY IT WAS THAT HARRY HAD BEEN SO RETICENT THEN HE HAD ALLURED HARRY ON TO A DIRECT LIE AND SOON PERCEIVED THAT HE COULD AFTERWARD USE THE SECRET FOR HIS OWN PURPOSE
THEY HAD NOW COME TO THE GATEWAY AND HE PAUSED AS SHE PUT HER TREMBLING HAND UPON THE LATCH
WHICH BROUGHT THE PARSONAGE GATE WITHIN THEIR VIEW FANNY KNEW THAT SHE WOULD LEAVE HIM THERE AND GO IN ALONE BUT SHE KNEW ALSO THAT SHE MUST SAY SOMETHING FURTHER TO HIM BEFORE SHE COULD THUS ESCAPE
SHE HAD NEVER WHISPERED THE NAME OF GEORGE TO ANY ONE SINCE HE HAD LEFT GRANPERE AND SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED THIS INDIGNITY IF HE FANCIES I WANT TO INTERFERE WITH HIM SHE SAID TO HERSELF THINKING OF HER UNCLE AND OF HER UNCLE'S PLANS IN REFERENCE TO HIS SON
MAY I VENTURE TO HAVE ANY HOPE HIS VOICE WAS SO SOLEMN AND THERE WAS SO MUCH OF EAGER SERIOUSNESS IN HIS FACE THAT FANNY COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO ANSWER HIM WITH QUICKNESS
I RATHER LIKE A STAND UP FIGHT JUST SO WHEN A FELLOW'S SO BUMPTIOUS AS THAT HE OUGHT TO BE LICKED HE HAS LIED ABOUT MOUNTJOY SAID AUGUSTUS THEN JONES WAITED TO BE TOLD HOW IT WAS THAT HARRY HAD LIED
GEORGE VOSS WILL NEVER COME BACK FOR YOU SAID MADAME VOSS HE WILL COME WHEN I ASK HIM SAID MARIE FLASHING ROUND UPON HER AUNT WITH ALL THE FIRE OF HER BRIGHT EYES DOES ANY ONE SAY THAT I HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO BRING HIM TO ME
AMONG COMMONERS THE FIRST IN PROSPECTS AND THE FIRST IN RANK AND TO HIM FLORENCE MOUNTJOY HAD BEEN ALLOTTED AS A BRIDE HOW HE HAD HIMSELF LEARNED FIRST TO ENVY AND THEN TO COVET THIS ALLOTTED BRIDE NEED NOT HERE BE TOLD
THEN MOUNTJOY HAD DISAPPEARED HAD DISAPPEARED AS THE READER WILL HAVE UNDERSTOOD WITH HIS BROTHER'S CO OPERATION AND HARRY HAD NOT COME FORWARD
THE ANSWER THAT WAS IN HER MIND WAS IN TRUTH THIS HOW CAN YOU ASK ME TO TRY TO LOVE A MAN WHO HAS BUT SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR IN THE WORLD WHILE I MYSELF HAVE NOTHING BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS DEMEANOR
AND KNEW THAT HE HAD EXERCISED IT WELL SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS GOOD AND TRUE AND HONEST AND RECOGNIZED IN HIM ALSO MANLY COURAGE AND SPIRITED RESOLUTION SHE WOULD NOT TELL HERSELF THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD LOVE HIM
BUT SHE HAD PROMISED TO TRY AND SHE MUST BE REMINDED OF HER PROMISE HITHERTO SHE CERTAINLY HAD NOT TRIED HITHERTO SHE HAD BEEN ILL TEMPERED PETULANT AND ALMOST RUDE HE WOULD NOT SEE HER HIMSELF THIS EVENING BUT HE WOULD SEND A MESSAGE TO HER BY HIS WIFE
I DO NOT THINK I CAN MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW WELL I LOVE IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I CAN NEVER AGAIN HAVE THE SAME FEELING FOR ANY PLACE THAT I HAVE FOR THIS THERE IS NOT A HOUSE A FIELD A GREEN LANE THAT IS NOT DEAR TO ME
IF I AM TOLD THAT I MAY NEVER HOPE THAT YOU WILL BECOME MY WIFE BUT MISTER SAUL
IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT MISTER JONES WOULD NOT THUS HAVE EXPRESSED HIMSELF UNLESS HIS FRIEND AUGUSTUS SCARBOROUGH HAD DROPPED CERTAIN WORDS IN CONVERSATION IN REGARD TO HARRY TO THE SAME EFFECT
HE HAD NEITHER QUENCHED HIS OWN THIRST NOR BROUGHT US ONE DROP IN HIS GOURD MOREOVER WE SOON MADE THE DISASTROUS DISCOVERY THAT IF OUR PROGRESS CONTINUED
I COULD NOT BUT COMPARE IT TO SOME FAMILIAR SPIRIT GUIDING US THROUGH THE EARTH AND I DABBLED MY FINGERS IN ITS TEPID WATER WHICH SANG LIKE A NAIAD AS WE PROGRESSED
THE UNCERTAIN LIGHT BEGAN TO SHINE UPON THE WALLS OF THE PASSAGE AND THEN IT CAME IN VIEW FAR DOWN THE SLOPING TUNNEL AT LENGTH HANS HIMSELF APPEARED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR MATTERS TO HAVE TURNED OUT OTHERWISE OUR PECULIAR JOURNEY HAD NO CHANCE OF BEING DIVERSIFIED BY LANDSCAPE AND SCENERY AT ALL EVENTS SUCH WAS MY IDEA AT LENGTH
THEN ALL AT ONCE THE LEAF YELLOWS AND DRIES UP AND THUS IT IS WITH THE COURTIER THANKS TO THAT EMBALMING WHICH IS CALLED LEGITIMACY THE PRINCE HIMSELF
ON WEDNESDAY THE FIFTEENTH WE WERE ACTUALLY SEVEN LEAGUES TWENTY ONE MILES BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND FIFTY LEAGUES DISTANT FROM THE MOUNTAIN OF SNEFFELS THOUGH IF THE TRUTH BE TOLD WE WERE VERY TIRED
AND LEFT BY THE DUTCHMEN WHO WERE ALL DEAD AND THAT THE CHIMNEY WAS BUILT OF A BARREL WITH THE END KNOCKED OUT SUNK INTO THE ROOF I DON'T UNDERSTAND MUCH OF THY RIGMAROLE
ONCE MORE I BEGAN TO LOSE ALL HOPE MY UNCLE HOWEVER OBSERVING HOW DOWNHEARTED I WAS AGAIN BECOMING TOOK UP THE CONVERSATION HANS WAS RIGHT HE EXCLAIMED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
THAT IT IS SAILING IN SUCH A LATITUDE THAT IT HAS MET A SEA MONSTER THAT IT IS IN SIGHT OF SHORE THAT IT IS IN DISTRESS THAT IT IS ABOUT TO FOUNDER THAT IT IS LOST ET CETERA THE CAPTAIN TAKES A BOTTLE
BE IT SO ELIZABETH UNDERSTOOD A COUNTRY THE MORE FOR HOLLAND WAS A COUNTRY THE LESS FOR ENGLAND THE BOTTLE WHICH HAD GIVEN THE INFORMATION WAS HELD TO BE OF IMPORTANCE AND THENCEFORWARD
OUR HEALTH HAD RESISTED ALL SUFFERING AND WAS IN A MOST SATISFACTORY STATE OUR TRAVELER'S BOX OF MEDICAMENTS HAD NOT EVEN BEEN OPENED
LET US BEGIN BY TAKING SOME HOURS OF REPOSE I HAD UTTERLY FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS NIGHT THE CHRONOMETER HOWEVER INFORMED ME OF THE FACT
IF IT FLOATS IT IS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE FLOTSAM OFFICER IF IT BE THROWN UPON SHORE IT CONCERNS THE JETSAM OFFICER
AND THEN TRY TO STOP THE OPENING UP MY ADVICE AFTER SOME HESITATION WAS FOLLOWED OR ATTEMPTED TO BE FOLLOWED HANS PICKED UP ALL THE BROKEN PIECES OF GRANITE HE HAD KNOCKED OUT
GUIDED BY AN INSTINCT PECULIAR TO THE DWELLERS IN MOUNTAIN REGIONS AND WATER FINDERS HE SMELT THE LIVING SPRING THROUGH THE ROCK STILL HE HAD NOT SEEN THE PRECIOUS LIQUID
AND A CERTAIN SURVEILLANCE IS WISE JOSIANA HAD LORD DAVID WATCHED BY A LITTLE CREATURE OF HERS IN WHOM SHE REPOSED CONFIDENCE AND WHOSE NAME WAS BARKILPHEDRO
ALTHOUGH FALLEN AND CAST AWAY LASTS AND KEEPS PRESERVED IT IS NOT SO WITH THE COURTIER MUCH MORE DEAD THAN THE KING THE KING BEYOND THERE IS A MUMMY THE COURTIER HERE
NOW MY WORTHY UNCLE THE PROFESSOR NO DOUBT REGARDED THIS DISCOVERY AS A VERY SIMPLE FACT BUT TO ME THE IDEA WAS BY NO MEANS A PLEASANT ONE
WAS A SUCCESS HE WAS OVERJOYED BY IT HE HAD ASPIRED TO THIS CONTEMPTUOUS FAMILIARITY LADY JOSIANA THEES AND THOUS ME HE WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF AND HE WOULD RUB HIS HANDS
HE APPROACHED MY UNCLE PLACED HIS HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER AND GENTLY AWAKENED HIM MY UNCLE AS SOON AS HE SAW WHO IT WAS INSTANTLY AROSE WELL EXCLAIMED THE PROFESSOR
FOR ONCE I THOUGHT I SAW A SMILE ON HIS IMPERTURBABLE FACE HE ROSE FROM A STONE ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SEATED AND TOOK UP THE LAMP I COULD NOT HELP RISING AND FOLLOWING
VATTEN SAID THE HUNTER I DID NOT KNOW A SINGLE WORD OF THE DANISH LANGUAGE AND YET BY A SORT OF MYSTERIOUS INSTINCT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE GUIDE HAD SAID
I MADE A DISCOVERY WHY IT IS CHALYBEATE WATER A MOST EXCELLENT STOMACHIC REPLIED MY UNCLE AND HIGHLY MINERALIZED HERE IS A JOURNEY WORTH TWENTY TO SPA
MOREOVER FROM TIME TO TIME THE SLOPES WERE MUCH GREATER THE NAIAD SANG MORE LOUDLY AND WE BEGAN TO DIP DOWNWARDS IN EARNEST AS YET HOWEVER I FELT NO PAINFUL SENSATION
WHAT MODULATIONS POSSIBLE WHAT AMALGAMATION OF SOULS
BY LITTLE STEADY BLOWS OF HIS INSTRUMENT MAKING NO ATTEMPT AT A LARGER HOLE THAN ABOUT SIX INCHES AS I STOOD I HEARD OR I THOUGHT I HEARD
WE CAN VERY EASILY FIND OUT I REPLIED PULLING OUT A MAP AND COMPASSES YOU SEE I SAID AFTER CAREFUL MEASUREMENT THAT I AM NOT MISTAKEN WE ARE FAR BEYOND CAPE PORTLAND
THAT IS BY NO MEANS DOUBTFUL REPLIED MY UNCLE IF THIS COLUMN OF WATER IS ABOUT THIRTY TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE MUST BE SOMETHING ENORMOUS
AT TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE DAY THE FISSURE SUDDENLY ASSUMED A MUCH MORE GENTLE SLOPE STILL TRENDING IN A SOUTHEAST DIRECTION THE ROAD NOW BECAME COMPARATIVELY EASY AND AT THE SAME TIME DREADFULLY MONOTONOUS
EVERYTHING REALLY AND THEN EXCEPT THE STURGEON WHICH BELONGS TO THE KING I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SAID JOSIANA ALL THAT WOULD HAVE BELONGED TO NEPTUNE
BEHIND WHICH I COULD HEAR THE WATER SEETHING AND EFFERVESCING NOT TWO FEET AWAY BUT A SOLID WALL OF GRANITE STILL SEPARATED US FROM IT HANS LOOKED KEENLY AT ME AND STRANGE ENOUGH
I MADE NO REPLY BUT HASTENED ON ONCE MORE ANIMATED BY HOPE
I WAS IN A STATE OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT I SCARCELY DARED BELIEVE WHAT THE EIDER DUCK HUNTER WAS ABOUT TO DO IT WAS HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE IN A MOMENT MORE NOT TO BOTH UNDERSTAND
WATER WATER I CRIED IN A WILD AND FRANTIC TONE CLAPPING MY HANDS AND GESTICULATING LIKE A MADMAN
OUR CALVES ACHED WE THEN SEATED OURSELVES ON SOME PROJECTING ROCK WITH OUR LEGS HANGING OVER AND GOSSIPED WHILE WE ATE A MOUTHFUL DRINKING STILL FROM THE PLEASANTLY WARM RUNNING STREAM WHICH HAD NOT DESERTED US
AND THE NAME OF HANSBACH
N'EST TU PAS LA CHABOT FOR BARKILPHEDRO
I BEGAN TO THINK WHY SHOULD NOT A MAN AS SERIOUSLY CONVINCED AS MY UNCLE SUCCEED WITH SO EXCELLENT A GUIDE AS WORTHY HANS AND SO DEVOTED A NEPHEW AS MYSELF
IS A PHANTOM TO BE THE SHADOW OF A SHADOW IS LEANNESS INDEED HENCE BARKILPHEDRO BECAME FAMISHED THEN HE TOOK UP THE CHARACTER OF A MAN OF LETTERS
WE REACHED A KIND OF VAST GROTTO
HANS WENT QUIETLY TO WORK A WORK WHICH NEITHER MY UNCLE NOR I WOULD HAVE UNDERTAKEN AT ANY PRICE OUR IMPATIENCE WAS SO GREAT THAT IF WE HAD ONCE BEGUN WITH PICKAX AND CROWBAR
TRAVELING ON FRIDAY EVENING THE TENTH OF JULY ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATION WE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THIRTY LEAGUES TO THE SOUTHEAST OF REYKJAVIK AND ABOUT TWO LEAGUES AND A HALF DEEP
JOSIANA'S LAUGH REDOUBLED WHAT MEANEST THOU THOU ART FOOLING NO MADAM TO AMUSE MYSELF I SHALL ANSWER YOU SERIOUSLY SAID THE DUCHESS
OF OLD MEMORIES OF FABLES OF FIDELITY OF TOUCHING STORIES HE PIERCED AS FAR AS THE DUCHESS JOSIANA'S HEART JOSIANA TOOK A LIKING TO THIS MAN OF POVERTY AND WIT
RUSHING SPLUTTERING AND STILL FALLING SEVERAL TIMES I PASSED MY HAND ACROSS THE ROCK HOPING TO FIND SOME TRACE OF HUMIDITY OF THE SLIGHTEST PERCOLATION ALAS IN VAIN
THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING FLOATING SOMETHING BEING CAST UP IT IS THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE SEA
BUT HE WAS THRUST BACK EVEN FROM THE KITCHENS SOMETIMES HE KNEW NOT WHERE TO SLEEP WHO WILL GIVE ME SHELTER HE WOULD ASK HE STRUGGLED ON ALL THAT IS INTERESTING IN PATIENCE IN DISTRESS
THAT HE WAS SEARCHING FOR THE EXACT SPOT WHERE THE TORRENT'S ROAR WAS MOST PLAINLY HEARD THIS POINT HE SOON FOUND IN THE LATERAL WALL ON THE LEFT SIDE ABOUT THREE FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE TUNNEL FLOOR
BOILING I CRIED IN BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT WELL NEVER MIND SAID MY UNCLE IT WILL SOON GET COOL THE TUNNEL BEGAN TO BE FILLED BY CLOUDS OF VAPOR
YOUR GRACE UNDERSTANDS NO ALL THAT IS IN THE SEA ALL THAT SINKS ALL THAT FLOATS ALL THAT IS CAST ASHORE ALL BELONGS TO THE ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND
AND A PARCHMENT DRAWN OUT OF IT GAVE INFORMATION TO ENGLAND THAT HOLLAND HAD TAKEN WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT IT AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY NOVA ZEMBLA
THE ROAR OF THE TORRENT MOMENTARILY INCREASING IN LOUDNESS AND AT TIMES I ALMOST FELT THE PLEASANT SENSATION OF WATER UPON MY PARCHED LIPS AT THE END OF WHAT APPEARED AN AGE
MY UNCLE BEGAN TO THINK OF USING MORE VIOLENT MEASURES I HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN CHECKING HIM HE HAD INDEED JUST GOT HOLD OF HIS CROWBAR WHEN A LOUD AND WELCOME HISS WAS HEARD
BARKILPHEDRO FELT NEITHER HUNGER NOR COLD AGAIN JOSIANA ADDRESSED HIM IN THE SECOND PERSON IT WAS THE FASHION FOR GREAT LADIES TO DO SO TO MEN OF LETTERS
THEN A STREAM OR RATHER JET OF WATER BURST THROUGH THE WALL
NO DOUBT OLD OCEAN FLOWS OVER OUR HEADS WELL MY DEAR BOY WHAT CAN BE MORE NATURAL DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF NEWCASTLE THERE ARE COAL MINES WHICH HAVE BEEN WORKED FAR OUT UNDER THE SEA
WHILE WHEN IT FLOWED MORE PEACEFULLY I PICTURED TO MYSELF THE PLACIDITY OF THE ICELANDIC GUIDE DURING THE WHOLE OF TWO DAYS THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH OF JULY WE FOLLOWED THE EXTRAORDINARY SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE FISSURE
WE RESUMED OUR MARCH ON THURSDAY AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE GREAT GRANITE TUNNEL AS IT WENT ROUND BY SINUOUS AND WINDING WAYS PRESENTED EVERY NOW AND THEN SHARP TURNS
I THINK THAT IS VERY PROBABLE WELL THEN LET THIS WATER RUN IT WILL OF COURSE NATURALLY FOLLOW IN OUR TRACK AND WILL SERVE TO GUIDE AND REFRESH US
WE COULD HEAR IT INCREASING IN VOLUME EVERY MOMENT THE TORRENT WHICH FOR A LONG TIME COULD BE HEARD FLOWING OVER OUR HEADS NOW RAN DISTINCTLY ALONG THE LEFT WALL ROARING
AND SUPPOSING THE TORRENT ONCE HAVING GAINED AN INCH WERE TO TAKE AN ELL AND COME POURING BODILY THROUGH THE BROKEN ROCK NOT ONE OF THESE DANGERS WAS CHIMERICAL THEY WERE ONLY TOO REAL
IN WHAT DOES THE APPOINTMENT CONSIST MADAM IN FIFTEEN NINETY EIGHT A TARRED BOTTLE PICKED UP BY A MAN CONGER FISHING ON THE STRAND OF EPIDIUM PROMONTORIUM WAS BROUGHT TO QUEEN ELIZABETH
WHAT WAS THIS WATER WHENCE DID IT COME TO US WHAT WAS THAT THE SIMPLE FACT WAS IT WAS WATER AND THOUGH STILL WITH A TINGLE OF WARMTH ABOUT IT IT BROUGHT BACK TO THE HEART
HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF IN A CORNER WITH HIS USUAL IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY NOW SAID I IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE LETTING THIS WATER RUN TO WASTE
IF IT HAD EVER SERVED IN FORMER TIMES AS A KIND OF FUNNEL THROUGH WHICH PASSED THE ERUPTIVE MASSES VOMITED BY SNEFFELS I WAS AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN HOW IT HAD LEFT NO MARK WE WERE IN FACT
WHAT DEPARTMENT THE SEA PRIZE DEPARTMENT WELL THE DEPARTMENT IS SUBDIVIDED INTO THREE OFFICES LAGAN FLOTSAM AND JETSAM
AND LODGINGS AT THE ADMIRALTY AND FOR THAT WAY OF DOING NOTHING HOW IS ONE PAID
AND COMMENCE AN ATTACK UPON THE ROCK ITSELF SAVED I CRIED YES CRIED MY UNCLE EVEN MORE EXCITED AND DELIGHTED THAN MYSELF HANS IS QUITE RIGHT
HE WAS AN OLD SERVANT OF THE DUKE OF YORK HE HAD TRIED TO BE A CHURCHMAN BUT HAD FAILED THE DUKE OF YORK AN ENGLISH AND A ROMAN PRINCE COMPOUNDED OF ROYAL POPERY AND LEGAL ANGLICANISM
BESIDES WE KNEW THAT AS SOON AS THE DECLIVITY CEASED TO BE SO ABRUPT THE STREAM MUST RESUME ITS PEACEFUL COURSE AT THIS MOMENT IT REMINDED ME OF MY UNCLE HIS IMPATIENCE AND RAGE
WE DETECTIVES ARE USED TO ALL SORTS OF COMPLICATIONS AND MORE THAN ONCE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH WOMEN OFTEN ENOUGH THERE IS NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN A LITTLE INDISCRETION BUT I CAN SEE WHERE OUTSIDERS MIGHT MAKE TROUBLE PARTICULARLY HUSBANDS
CHAPTER SEVEN THE COLONEL IS SURPRISED THIS SAID COLONEL ASHLEY TO HIMSELF AS HE GLIDED RAPIDLY ALONG THE STREET IS VERY MUCH LIKE OLD TIMES VERY MUCH
THE COLONEL STEPPED INTO A CLOSET HE MADE A FEW RAPID CHANGES IN HIS CLOTHING AND TOOK OFF A TINY BIT OF EYEBROW WHICH HAD BEEN ADDED TO HIS OWN A SHORT TIME BEFORE
AS HIS CALLER LOOKED A BIT SURPRISED OH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WELL THIS WAS MISSUS LARCH'S CROSS IT IS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM I BELIEVE THOUGH MANY SUPPOSE HER HUSBAND GAVE IT TO HER FOR A WEDDING PRESENT
EH WHAT'S THAT DID I SAY ANYTHING AND THE DETECTIVE SEEMED ROUSED FROM A REVERIE FOR HE HAD SPOKEN HIS LAST REMARKS IN A LOW VOICE YOU SPOKE ABOUT A CARP THE RIGHT MAN OH I
AGREED THE DETECTIVE WELL I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FIRST I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME TO WORK ON THE MURDER CASE BUT AS I AM ALREADY ENGAGED ON THAT TO TRY TO CLEAR DARCY I CAN AS WELL INCLUDE THE DIAMOND CROSS MYSTERY ALSO
YOU CALL HER CYNTHIA I HAVE KNOWN HER SINCE WE WERE BOTH CHILDREN I SEE PRAY GO ON IN FACT WE WERE SWEETHEARTS CONTINUED GRAFTON AND WERE ENGAGED BUT THE MATCH WAS BROKEN OFF BY HER FATHER
I WONDER IF THEY HAVE ANY CONNECTION I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN HAVE MISSUS DARCY MAY MERELY HAVE PUT THE CROSS AWAY SECRETLY AND IT MAY TAKE A CAREFUL SEARCH OF THE PLACE TO FIND IT MAYBE SO I'LL HAVE TO NOSE AROUND A BIT THERE CAME A KNOCK ON THE OFFICE DOOR COME
DID YOU EVER READ DE MAUPASSANT'S DIAMOND NECKLACE I NEVER DID I'D ADVISE YOU TO ALSO WALTON
AND HE'S WORRYING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE IN THE JEWELRY SHOP AND ISN'T NOW WHAT IS IT THIS VERY EVIDENTLY WAS SOMETHING FOR COLONEL ASHLEY TO DISCOVER AND WITH ALL HIS SKILL HE SET HIMSELF TO THIS TASK
WERE THE FIRST WORDS OF THE PRISONER WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WARDEN'S OFFICE WITH A DETECTIVE FROM THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE SEATED A FEW CHAIRS AWAY IT WAS ONLY UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS THAT VISITORS WERE ALLOWED TO SEE THE JEWELRY WORKER HOW IS AMY
THEN HE CONFRONTED THE MERCHANT THE MAN I SAW IN THE JEWELRY STORE GASPED GRAFTON I REMEMBER NOW SEEING YOU THERE THE DAY I WENT TO LOOK FOR THE DIAMOND CROSS AND DIDN'T FIND IT SAID THE DETECTIVE
IT WOULD BE BETTER SINCE I ALREADY KNOW YOURS I SHALL KEEP THEM IN STRICT CONFIDENCE HOWEVER NOW THAT I AM FAIRLY WELL ASSURED THERE IS NO ULTERIOR MOTIVE IN YOUR VISIT TO ME PROCEED WELL THEN
SO THAT I MAY RELY ON YOUR SILENCE AND ER DISCRETION SIR THE COLONEL FAIRLY BRISTLED I BEG YOUR PARDON I SHOULD NOT HAVE ASKED THAT BUT I AM ALL UPSET OVER THIS MATTER
BUT IT'S TOO LATE TO THINK OF THAT NOW DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THAT WATCH THE ONE IN HER HAND IT BELONGED TO AN EAST INDIAN YOU SAID YES TO SINGA PHUT
DON'T THINK I AM TELLING YOU THIS OUT OF MERE JEALOUSY AARON GRAFTON WENT ON AND HIS MANNER WAS EARNEST I LOVED HER DEEPLY AND SINCERELY I DO YET BUT
GOING OUT WITH HIM BUT I CAME BACK THOUGH THE OLD WOUND STILL HURT I TRIED NOT TO LET HER SEE WE BECAME FRIENDS AGAIN
MUSED THE COLONEL WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS IN COMING TO THE DARCY PLACE AND NOSING AROUND AS HE DID THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME OBJECT A MAN SUCH AS HE IS DOESN'T DO THINGS LIKE THAT FOR FUN AND IT WASN'T MERE CURIOSITY EITHER
THOUGH THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT SAID THE DETECTIVE NOW I'LL LEAVE YOU I HAVE LOTS TO DO I'M SORRY COLONEL TO PUT YOU TO ALL THIS TROUBLE POOH NOW I'M IN IT THERE'S NO TROUBLE THAT'S TOO MUCH I'LL GET ABOUT THE SAME FUN OUT OF THIS AS I WOULD IF I FISHED
THEN THE YOUNG MAN SLOWLY ANSWERED NO NO I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT DID IT WELL THEN I'LL HAVE TO FISH ON THAT ALONE I GUESS I THOUGHT YOU KNOWING A LOT ABOUT CLOCK WORKS MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION
WELL I SUPPOSE THAT WAS ALL RIGHT NO SINGA PHUT DIDN'T HAVE A THING TO DO WITH THE KILLING I'M POSITIVE OF THAT AND HIS ALIBI IS PERFECT SAID THE COLONEL WELL I GUESS YOU'VE TOLD ME ALL I WANT TO KNOW
REALLY I WAS SO DISTRESSED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK I DID NOT WANT TO TELL ANY ONE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR SO I WENT ABOUT QUIETLY BUT I COULD NOT FIND IT THEN I WAS OBLIGED TO ASK DARCY ABOUT IT SECRETLY OF COURSE AND WITHOUT HINTING AS TO THE OWNERSHIP
HE WAS NOW FOLLOWING GRAFTON WITHOUT THE LATTER BEING AWARE OF IT NO VERY DIFFICULT MATTER IN A CITY THE SIZE OF COLCHESTER AND ON ONE OF ITS MAIN STREETS I THINK I WANT TO KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT HIM MUSED THE COLONEL
I TOOK THE CROSS TO HER THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED AND SHE PROMISED TO HAVE HER COUSIN FIX IT WITHOUT TELLING HIM WHOSE IT WAS AND GET IT BACK TO ME SECRETLY IN A DAY OR SO I THOUGHT CYNTHIA COULD
VERY GOOD DID HE EVER DO ANY BUSINESS WITH YOU I MEAN BUY ANYTHING IN THE STORE WHY YES I THINK VERY POSSIBLY HE MIGHT
THEN SIR LET ME EASE YOUR MIND BY STATING THAT WHATEVER YOU TELL ME WILL BE IN STRICT CONFIDENCE AS FAR AS LIES IN MY POWER TO SO OBSERVE IT I CAN NOT COMPOUND A FELONY SO IF YOU HAVE IN MIND THE DISCLOSURE OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD INCRIMINATE YOU INCRIMINATE ME YES OR
HE SAID MISSUS DARCY HAD NOT GIVEN IT TO HIM NOR ASKED HIM TO REPAIR IT NOR WAS IT IN THE SHOP AS FAR AS HE KNEW
AND THE MORE HE SAW OF THAT GENTLEMAN THE MORE THE DETECTIVE BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE MERCHANT KNEW SOMETHING OF THE CRIME
THAT IS WHY I REVEALED MYSELF TO YOU BUT YOU MUST KEEP MY SECRET IF I AM TO HELP YOU I AM KNOWN IN COLCHESTER AS COLONEL BRENTNALL HAVING REGISTERED AT THE HOTEL UNDER THAT NAME I WILL KEEP THAT NAME FOR THE PRESENT
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU PARTICULARLY IF HE WERE JEALOUS AS MANY HUSBANDS ARE SO YOU WANT ME TO TRY TO GET THIS DIAMOND CROSS BELONGING TO THE MARRIED LADY BACK FOR YOU WITHOUT HER HUSBAND KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT'S IT
THE FOLLOWING WAS WELL DONE AND A LITTLE LATER THE TWO MACHINES DREW UP IN FRONT OF THE BIG OFFICE BUILDING IN WHICH COLONEL ASHLEY HAD HIS HEADQUARTERS WHEW
NOTHING VERY COMPLICATED OR TROUBLESOME IN THAT I SUPPOSE THE CROSS WAS STOLEN FROM YOU WHILE IT WAS TEMPORARILY IN YOUR POSSESSION AND YOU DON'T LIKE TO LET YOUR FRIEND KNOW FOR FEAR SHE MAY SUSPECT YOU SUCH THINGS HAVE HAPPENED
THERE WERE FEW TRICKS KNOWN TO MODERN DETECTIVES OF WHICH COLONEL ASHLEY WAS NOT MASTER AMONG THEM BEING THE ABILITY TO DISGUISE HIMSELF NOT BY CLUMSY BEARDS AND FALSE MOUSTACHES THOUGH HE USED THEM AT TIMES
I CAME HERE PREPARED TO PAY ANY REASONABLE AMOUNT AND THE MERCHANT DREW OUT HIS WALLET THE COLONEL HELD UP A PROTESTING HAND PLEASE DON'T NOT YET HE SAID I CAN NOT ACCEPT A RETAINING FEE UNTIL I HAVE HEARD MORE OF YOUR CASE
I HAVE OFTEN HEARD YOU SPOKEN OF AND I HAVE READ OF MORE THAN ONE OF YOUR CASES SO WHEN I GOT IN THIS WELL I MAY AS WELL CALL IT TROUBLE I AT ONCE THOUGHT OF YOU I AM FORTUNATE I BELIEVE IN SEEING COLONEL ASHLEY HIMSELF WHO I UNDERSTOOD HAD RETIRED OR
THE FRANKER YOU ARE THE FEWER QUESTIONS I SHALL HAVE TO ASK GO ON WELL THEN I WANT TO FIND A CERTAIN VALUABLE DIAMOND CROSS A DIAMOND CROSS YES I DON'T KNOW JUST WHAT IT IS WORTH BUT I BELIEVE A SMALL FORTUNE
I TAKE IT THEN THAT YOU AND THE LADY WERE OUT TOGETHER WITHOUT HER HUSBAND KNOWING IT I HOPE HE DOESN'T KNOW OF IT FOR THOUGH ON MY HONOR THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG IN OUR BEING TOGETHER IT MIGHT BE HARD TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE THAT
THERE WAS A WORLD OF MEANING IN THAT EXCLAMATION AARON GRAFTON TURNED A DEEP RED AND BIT HIS LIPS
AND HE HURRIED TO A PRIVATE BOOTH IN A BACK OFFICE LEAVING GRAFTON TO HIMSELF AFTER HE HAD TELEPHONED COLONEL ASHLEY SAT IN SILENCE IN THE BOOTH MUSING NOW I WONDER HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF GRAFTON IS TELLING ME THE TRUTH
CALLED OUT THE COLONEL HIS CLERK HANDED HIM A TELEGRAM TEARING IT OPEN THE DETECTIVE READ A MESSAGE FROM ONE OF HIS AGENTS IN A DISTANT WESTERN CITY IT SAID SPOTTY MORGAN ARRESTED HERE TO DAY
INVOLVE YOU IN ANY WAY IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN MIND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME ABOUT IT I SHOULD FEEL OBLIGED TO MAKE USE OF MY KNOWLEDGE
I'D GIVE MY VERY LIFE TO MAKE HER HAPPY AND DO YOU THINK I'D I DON'T DOUBT YOU FOR A MOMENT SIR THANK YOU SAID MISTER GRAFTON
HAVING FOLLOWED HIS MAN TO THE LATTER'S STORE AND EVEN INSIDE IT WHERE HE MADE A TRIFLING PURCHASE AND HAVING SEEN MISTER GRAFTON ENTER HIS PRIVATE OFFICE THE DETECTIVE PAID A VISIT TO DARCY IN THE JAIL HOW IS SHE COLONEL
IT MAY BE THAT I CAN NOT SERVE YOU GIVE ME SOME INKLING OF WHAT YOU WANT I HOPE YOU ARE NOT IN SERIOUS TROUBLE IT IS SERIOUS FOR ME THEN I HOPE I CAN HELP YOU PLEASE BE AS FRANK AS YOU THINK BEST
IT WAS TO TALK OVER WHAT COURSE WAS BEST FOR HER TO PURSUE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE AND I WALKED OUT TOGETHER WE WENT IN SECRET FOR THERE ARE GOSSIPING AND WAGGING TONGUES IN COLCHESTER AS ELSEWHERE AND IF I
HOW ABOUT HAVING HIS WATCH REPAIRED I'D REMEMBER I THINK IF I HAD FIXED HIS WATCH I'M SURE I DIDN'T HE HAS A FINE ONE FOR I'VE SEEN HIM STOP IN FRONT OF OUR WINDOW AND COMPARE HIS TIME WITH OUR CHRONOMETER I SEE NOW ANOTHER MATTER
IF IT WAS HE'D HAVE BEEN AT THE PLACE BEFORE WHEN THE EVIDENCES OF THE CRIME WERE THERE TO BE STARED AT BY THOSE WHO CARE FOR SUCH THINGS AND THAT AARON GRAFTON HASN'T BEEN THERE SINCE I WAS FORCED INTO THIS THING I'M POSITIVE FOR I WAS FORCED INTO IT
CYNTHIA'S HUSBAND MAY ASK ABOUT IT AT ANY MOMENT AND WHAT EXCUSE CAN SHE GIVE
FOLLOW THAT TAXI THE COLONEL ORDERED THE DRIVER OF HIS MACHINE AS IT ROLLED OUT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA STATION JUST A FEW LENGTHS BEHIND THE ONE IN WHICH GRAFTON RODE
BUT NO MATTER I MUST SEE WHAT FRIEND AARON IS UP TO AND WHAT HIS LITTLE GAME IS
HE DOES WANT TO SEE ME EXCITEDLY THOUGHT THE COLONEL WHAT IN THE WORLD FOR THIS IS GETTING INTERESTING I'VE GOT TO DO A LITTLE FINE WORK NOW HE MUST NEVER SUSPECT AT LEAST FOR A WHILE THAT I HAVE BEEN IN COLCHESTER
SHOOT AND THE CAR SHOT UP WITH SPEED ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE COLONEL TO GASP USED AS HE WAS TO RAPID MOTION
AND HIS DINNER AT THE BEAUFORT NOR DID HE MENTION THE DINNER TO HIS DEAR FRIEND CECILIA
WHAT IS THERE MORE TO SAY THAN THAT I AM THE HAPPIEST WOMAN BETWEEN THE SEAS THE READER MUST BE HERE TOLD THAT THIS LETTER HAD BEEN COPIED OUT A SECOND TIME BECAUSE IN THE FIRST COPY SHE HAD ALLOWED THE WORD GIRL TO PASS IN THE ABOVE SENTENCE SOMETHING TOLD HER
BETTER THAN HE KNEW IT HIMSELF SLOWLY THE COUNT ATE HIS DINNER ENJOYING EVERY MORSEL THAT HE TOOK WITH THAT THOUGHTFUL CONSCIOUS PLEASURE WHICH YOUNG MEN NEVER ATTAIN IN EATING AND DRINKING AND WHICH MEN AS THEY GROW OLDER SO OFTEN FORGET TO ACQUIRE
AND THEY WERE MORE THAN DICK COULD ENDURE THE NATURAL INDIGNATION OF THE MAN WAS AROUSED SO THAT BY DEGREES IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HE HATED THE BARONET HE HAD BEFORE SAID VERY SHARP WORDS TO HIM BUT HAD NOW GONE HOME RESOLVED IN HIS RIGHTEOUS MIND TO BRING THINGS TO A CONCLUSION
BUT THE LADY SEEMED TO HESITATE AND ASKED FOR A WEEK TO THINK ABOUT IT THIS SHOWED SO MUCH INGRATITUDE ON HER PART WAS SO POOR AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE POSITION WHICH HE HAD OFFERED HER THAT HE WAS INCLINED TO BE INDIGNANT
HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFIED WITH IT
THAT SHE HAD BETTER WRITE WOMAN INSTEAD AND SHE HAD WRITTEN IT WHAT MORE IS THERE FOR ME TO ADD TO THE ABOVE EXCEPT TO TELL YOU THAT I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART MONTHS AGO IT SEEMS TO BE YEARS NOW WHEN CECILIA HOLT HAD CAUGHT YOUR FANCY
HE BECAME THEREFORE GRADUALLY MORE GRACIOUS AFTER THE LITTLE SPEECH WHICH HAS BEEN ABOVE GIVEN DICK HAD UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY WHO THE SHE HAD BEEN
AS NO QUESTION HAD BEEN ASKED HE HAD MADE NO REPLY
AS SOON AS HIS MARRIAGE WITH MISS ALTIFIORLA SHOULD HAVE BEEN SETTLED HE DID NOT WISH TO LEAVE HIMSELF ALTOGETHER ALONE IN THE WORLD AND IF THIS DICK WERE DISMISSED IT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH ANOTHER UNLESS HE WERE MINDED TO PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH A WIFE INSTEAD
AND AMONG THEM WAS ONE FROM MISS ALTIFIORLA BUT DICK HAD A BUDGET OF NEWS WHICH HE WAS ANXIOUS TO REVEAL AND WHICH HE DID TELL BEFORE SIR FRANCIS HAD SAID ANYTHING AS TO HIS OWN LETTER THERE WAS ANOTHER FRIEND ONE CAPTAIN FAWKES AT THE LODGE WITH THEM
EXPRESSING AN OPINION THAT THE FIFTY ONE LAFITTE WAS UNEXCEPTIONAL THE FIFTY ONE LAFITTE WAS ORDERED AND HARRY AS HE FILLED HIS GLASS CONSIDERED THE WAY IN WHICH HIS SUBJECT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED YOU KNEW LORD ONGAR I THINK ABROAD
AND NOT ADD ANYTHING TO THE BUCKET OF CLARET JUST AS YOU PLEASE SAID SIR FRANCIS THEN DICK ROSS LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT AWAY TO MAKE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIS DEPARTURE AS WERE POSSIBLE TO HIM AND THE READERS OF THIS STORY SHALL SEE HIM AND HEAR HIM NO MORE
AND HIS SPEECH HARDLY BETRAYED THAT HE WAS NOT ENGLISH HARRY KNOWING THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER NOTICED NOW AND AGAIN SOME LITTLE ACQUIRED DISTINCTNESS OF SPEECH WHICH IS HARDLY NATURAL TO A NATIVE BUT OTHERWISE THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS TONGUE TO BETRAY HIM
BUT THEY WERE DAMNABLE LIES YOU SOMETIMES TELL ME THAT I AIN'T ANY BETTER THAN ANOTHER OR GENERALLY A GREAT DEAL WORSE BUT I'D RATHER HAVE BLOWN MY BRAINS OUT THAN HAVE TOLD SUCH LIES ABOUT A WOMAN AS HAVE BEEN TOLD HERE BY SOMEBODY YOU ASK ME WHAT THEY WERE SAYING AT THE CLUB IN PERTH
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WITH THE BISHOP AND TAKEN A LESSON IN PREACHING I NEVER HEARD YOU COME OUT SO STRONG BEFORE I WISH YOU'D HEARD WHAT SOME OF THOSE MEN AT PERTH SAID ABOUT YOU AND HOW YOU ANSWERED THEM AS MY FRIEND AS FAR AS I REMEMBER I DIDN'T SAY MUCH MYSELF
AND WHY WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF THEIRS SINCE YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT WHY HAS SHE GONE TO PERSUADE HER BROTHER TO COME HOME AND TAKE HIS WIFE ONCE MORE IT WAS AN INFERNAL SHAME THAT THEY SHOULD EVER HAVE BEEN SEPARATED
AND DICK HAD AT FIRST BEEN RESTRAINED BY THIS MAN'S PRESENCE AS SOON AS HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE WITH SIR FRANCIS HE BEGAN LADY GRANT HAS GONE OFF TO DRESDEN HE SAID WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT ASKED THE BARONET THEY TOLD ME SO AT THE CLUB
I SUPPOSE I COULD OR HOW MUCH YOU HAVE DRANK OF MY WINE I HAVEN'T MADE A CALCULATION OF THAT NATURE IT ISN'T USUAL FOR SHOOTING HERE HOW MUCH HAVE YOU EVER CONTRIBUTED WHEN I SHOOT I CONTRIBUTE NOTHING
SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FOR A LADY ALL ALONE AND A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE A HOUSE SO BEAUTIFUL THEY TELL ME WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT SAID HARRY WHEREUPON THE COUNT AGAIN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT
WOULD STILL HAVE SUFFERED I DO NOT THINK THAT THE WIFE YOU NOW DESIRE IS ONE WITH WHOM YOU WILL HAVE TO WAGE WAR SHALL I SAY THAT IF YOU MARRY HER WHOM YOU HAVE NOW ASKED TO JOIN HER LOT WITH YOURS THERE WILL BE NO SUCH FIGHTING
HE LOVED TO BE FLATTERED AND WAS PRONE TO BELIEVE ANYTHING GOOD OF HIMSELF THAT WAS SAID TO HIM BY ONE OF THEM HE THEREFORE TOOK THE FOLLOWING LETTER FOR MORE THAN IT WAS WORTH MY DEAR SIR FRANCIS I KNOW THAT YOU WILL HAVE BEEN QUITE QUICK ENOUGH TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHEN YOU RECEIVED MY FORMER LITTLE SCRAWL
EVEN TO HIMSELF THAT HE LIKED THE ONGAR CLASS BETTER BUT STILL AS SUCH WAS HIS LOT HE MUST TAKE IT AS IT CAME AND ENTERTAIN BOTH SUBJECTS OF INTEREST WITHOUT ANY COMMINGLING OF THEM
WHICH WOULD NOT SUIT THERE IS AN ASPERITY RATHER THAN STRICTNESS ABOUT HER WHICH I KNEW YOUR SPIRIT WOULD NOT BROOK SHE WOULD HAVE BORNE THE BATTLINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE ARISEN WITH AN EQUAL TEMPER SHE CAN INDEED BEAR ALL THINGS WITH EQUANIMITY AS SHE DOES HER PRESENT POSITION BUT YOU
AND I SHOULD SAY THAT I HAD NOT EVEN IF I HAD PATEROFF WAS SPEAKING OF LADY ONGAR IN THIS WAY AND HARRY HATED HIM FOR DOING SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO SAY ANY GOOD OF HER SAID HE OR ANY EVIL I CERTAINLY SHALL SAY NO EVIL OF HER
IT MUST BE HERE EXPLAINED THAT DICK ROSS WAS NOT A MAN WHO FEARED MANY THINGS BUT THAT SIR FRANCIS FEARED MUCH DICK HAD LITTLE TO LOSE BY A ROW WHEREAS THE BARONET WOULD BE INJURED THE BARONET THEREFORE DECLINED TO FILL IN THE EPITHET WHICH HE HAD OMITTED
I KNOW NOTHING LOOK HERE MISTER CLAVERING IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY INQUIRY YOU HAD BETTER GO TO MY SISTER I DON'T SEE WHAT GOOD IT WILL DO
SIR FRANCIS WHEN HE WAS LEFT ALONE TOOK OUT MISS ALTIFIORLA'S LETTER AND READ IT AGAIN HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD ASSUME GRAND MANNERS IN HIS PERSONAL INTERCOURSE WITH WOMEN
I DON'T SUPPOSE THE WORLD MEANS TO CALL ME OUT FOR SAYING AS MUCH AS THAT THEN THE TWO REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTS AND DICK PROCEEDED WITH HIS ELOQUENCE
HE DESPISED THE BARONET ALMOST AS THOROUGHLY AS DID MISTER WESTERN BUT FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES AS TO WHICH HE DESPISED HIMSELF ALSO THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE BARONET SUITED HIM JUST AT PRESENT ONE MORNING FOR PRIVATE REASONS OF HIS OWN
WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD FROM ME IN CONFIDENCE I DON'T I THINK IT A VERY A VERY WHAT SIR FRANCIS I HAVE NOT DONE AS YOU ALLEGE BUT YOU WERE GOING TO OBSERVE A VERY WHAT WAS IT
HIS FATHER LORD COURTON WAS THEN ALIVE AS WAS ALSO HIS GRANDFATHER HE WAS A NICE GOOD LOOKING LAD THEN AS REGARDS HIS BEING NICE
YOU CAN GO TO MOUNT STREET AND SHE WILL BE DELIGHTED THERE IS THE CARD AND NOW WE WILL SMOKE HARRY FELT THAT HE COULD NOT WITH GOOD BREEDING DETAIN THE COUNT ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR LED THE WAY INTO THE SMOKING ROOM
HAD SHE EXPRESSED HER WARM AFFECTION AND AT ONCE ACCEPTED ALL THAT HAD BEEN PROFFERED THE GENTLEMAN WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LEARNT AT ONCE TO DESPISE THAT WHICH HAD BEEN OBTAINED SO EASILY AS IT WAS HE WAS SIMPLY CROSS AND THOUGHT THAT HE HAD DETERMINED TO WITHDRAW THE PROPOSAL
BUT I HOPE IT WILL PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS TO VISIT YOUR MOST WORTHY CLERICAL RELATIONS IN THIS CATHEDRAL CITY BEFORE LONG I SHALL SAY NOTHING TO ANY OF YOUR CLERICAL RELATIONS AS TO MY PROSPECTS IN LIFE UNTIL I SHALL HAVE RECEIVED YOUR SANCTION FOR DOING SO BUT THE SOONER I DO RECEIVE IT
ALL THAT EVERY POUND AND EVERY SHILLING AND EVERY PENNY WILL GIVE YOU AFTER THIS FASHION THE COUNT WAS A RICH MAN YOU DON'T SIT AFTER DINNER HERE I SUPPOSE SAID THE COUNT WHEN HE HAD COMPLETED AN ELABORATE WASHING OF HIS MOUTH AND MOUSTACHE
THIS THE COUNT NOTICED BY SIMPLY SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND SMILING AS HE SIPPED HIS WINE BY ALL THAT I CAN HEAR HE BECAME A HORRID BRUTE WHEN HE MARRIED SAID HARRY ENERGETICALLY HE WAS NOT PLEASANT WHEN HE WAS ILL AT FLORENCE SAID THE COUNT
THE BETTER FOR MY PEACE OF MIND SIR FRANCIS WAS UPON THE WHOLE DELIGHTED WITH THE LETTER AND THE MORE DELIGHTED AS HE NOW READ IT FOR THE THIRD TIME
THREE OR FOUR MEN HAD ALREADY SPOKEN TO THE COUNT SHOWING THAT HE WAS WELL KNOWN GIVING NOTICE AS IT WERE THAT PATEROFF WOULD BECOME A PUBLIC MAN WHEN ONCE HE WAS PLACED IN A PUBLIC CIRCLE TO HAVE GIVEN A DINNER TO THE COUNT
I HAVE SACRIFICED NO GIRL TO MY REVENGE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE HAS THROWN ME OVER IN THE LITTLE TRANSACTIONS I HAVE HAD I HAVE ALWAYS RUN STRAIGHT
I DO NOT LIVE IN MOUNT STREET I HAVE MY ADDRESS SOMETIMES AT HER HOUSE MADAME GORDELOUP YES MADAME GORDELOUP SHE IS LADY ONGAR'S FRIEND SHE WILL TALK TO YOU WILL YOU INTRODUCE ME COUNT PATEROFF OH NO IT IS NOT NECESSARY
BUT HER NAME HAS BEEN COVERED WITH LIES WHAT CAN I DO
NOW YOU KNOW IT PRETTY WELL ALL IT MUST BE SUPPOSED THAT WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE CLUB HAD INDUCED DICK TO DETERMINE THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER BECOME HIM TO REMAIN WITH SIR FRANCIS AS HIS HUMBLE FRIEND VERY EVIL THINGS HAD IN TRUTH BEEN SAID OF SIR FRANCIS
OF LADY ONGAR AND HIS EARLY LOVE HE HAD SPOKEN TO FLORENCE AT SOME LENGTH BUT HE DID NOT FIND IT NECESSARY IN HIS LETTERS
ON THE NEXT DAY HE DINED IN ONSLOW CRESCENT WITH THE BURTONS AND WHEN THERE HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT LADY ONGAR OR COUNT PATEROFF HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT HE HAD ANY SPECIAL REASON FOR BEING SILENT ON THE SUBJECT
BUT WITH YOU I SHALL ONLY ATTEMPT TO HOLD MY OWN BY MAKING MYSELF ONE WITH YOU IN ALL YOUR DESIRES AND ASPIRATIONS I AM YOURS WITH ALL MY HEART WITH ALL MY BODY AND SOUL FRANCESCA
PERHAPS TO MORROW WILL DO JUST AS YOU PLEASE THEN I SHALL BE ABLE TO ADD A FEW DROPS TO ALL THOSE BUCKETS OF CLARET WHICH YOU THREW IN MY TEETH JUST NOW I WONDER WHETHER ANY GENTLEMAN WAS EVER BEFORE ASKED BY ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
IT IS DISAGREEABLE TO BE A PENNILESS YOUNGER BROTHER I HAVE FOUND IT SO ALL MY LIFE AND I ADMIT THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE EARNED MY BREAD
BUT HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT THE BURTONS WERE PEOPLE SO FAR REMOVED IN THEIR SPHERE OF LIFE FROM LADY ONGAR THAT THE SUBJECT WOULD NOT BE SUITABLE IN ONSLOW CRESCENT IT WAS HIS LOT IN LIFE TO BE CONCERNED WITH PEOPLE OF THE TWO CLASSES HE DID NOT AT ALL MEAN TO SAY
IN FACT SHE HAS GONE TO UNDO WHAT YOU DID IF SHE CAN ONLY SUCCEED IN MAKING THE MAN KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT IT FREE FROM ALL LIES SHE'LL DO WHAT SHE'S GONE TO DO WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN BY LIES SAID SIR FRANCIS RISING IN WRATH FROM HIS CHAIR
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAS BEEN MOST CRUELLY TREATED WELL THERE IS ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR I THINK SEVEN THOUSAND A YEAR NOT FRANCS BUT POUNDS WE POOR FOREIGNERS LOSE OURSELVES IN AMAZEMENT WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT YOUR ENGLISH FORTUNES
BUT HIS GUEST WAS BY NO MEANS A MAN OF THAT STAMP EXCEPTING THAT THE COUNT'S AGE WAS ALTOGETHER UNCERTAIN NO CORRECTNESS OF GUESS ON THAT MATTER BEING POSSIBLE BY MEANS OF HIS APPEARANCE HARRY'S PRECONCEIVED NOTION WAS WRONG IN EVERY POINT
WHAT I DID SAY CERTAINLY WAS NOT IN YOUR FAVOUR BUT I WAS HARDEST ON THAT SWEET YOUNG LADY WITH THE ITALIAN NAME YOU WON'T MIND THAT BECAUSE YOU AND SHE ARE TWO NOW CAN YOU TELL ME ROSS
IT WAS THUS THAT HE SPOKE TO HIMSELF ABOUT THE LETTER AS HE SUCKED IN THE FLATTERY IT WAS THUS THAT MISS ALTIFIORLA HAD INTENDED THAT HE SHOULD RECEIVE IT SHE KNEW HERSELF TOO WELL TO SUSPECT THAT HER FLATTERY SHOULD FAIL NOT A WORD OF IT FAILED
EITHER OF LADY ONGAR OR OF HER LATE HUSBAND AT THIS TIME HE HAD BEEN DOWN TO ONGAR PARK ON THAT MISSION WHICH HAD BEEN AS WE KNOW FUTILE BUT HE SAID NO WORD OF THAT TO HARRY HE SEEMED TO ENJOY HIS DINNER THOROUGHLY AND MADE HIMSELF VERY AGREEABLE
IF HE HAD SEEN ME ALONE HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT NO MORE OF ME
THIS PLEASANT ROAD RAN ALONG THE SIDE OF A PURLING BROOK UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT TREES THAT SKIRTED THE FOREST
OR LISTENING TO THE MERRY CAROLS OF THE BIRDS OR NOTICING THE SPECKLED FISH THAT GAMBOLED THROUGH THE DARK GLIMMERING STREAM OR REVERTING TO THE SUBJECT OF HER LAST READING BUT BENEATH ALL THIS CHILDISH PLAY OF FANCY ONE GRAVE SORROWFUL THOUGHT
AND PRAYING ALOUD THERE TILL SIR AMYAS HAD HAD THE HOLE STOPPED UP
LAY UNDEVELOPED A LATENT POWER OF HEROISM SOON TO BE AROUSED INTO ACTION DARLING OF ALL HEARTS AND EYES EDITH HAD BEEN AT HOME A YEAR
WHAT'LL COME O YOU WHAT THE MASTER IN HEAVEN WILLS LORD LORD MISS EDY OLE MARSE ILL KILL WE DEM WHAT ILL OLD MARSE SAY WHAT
WHILE THESE THINGS WERE BREWING IN EDITH'S MIND SHE RODE SLOWLY AND MORE SLOWLY UNTIL AT LENGTH HER PONY STOPPED THEN SHE NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE HEAVY DOWNCAST LOOKS OF HER ATTENDANTS WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED
I HAVE NO TASTE TO BE A SPANISH SUBJECT WHY NOR HAVE I BUT THE KING OF SPAIN WILL BUT SAIL AWAY AGAIN WHEN HE HATH MADE TERMS AGAINST THE PRIVATEERS
EXPLAINING THE PLAN BY WHICH EACH PRIEST IF HE DESIRED
MISTRESS ALICE WAS THERE QUIET AS EVER YET PALER AND THINNER THAN IN FORMER YEARS MISTRESS BABINGTON HERSELF HAD GONE BACK TO HER FAMILY LAST YEAR
AT LEAST A PORTION OF IT TRUE LISTEN CRIED THE OTHER SUDDENLY AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE MISTER SUTTON WAS TAKEN AND WAS BANISHED AND CAME BACK AGAIN AS ANY WORTHY PRIEST WOULD DO THEN HE WAS TAKEN AGAIN AND CONDEMNED
YET HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY MISTER JOHN HAD WANDERED OFF TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS AND WAS HUMMING UNEASILY TO HIMSELF THEN SUDDENLY AN INTENSE CURIOSITY OVERCAME HIM HIS LIFE WAS A STRANGE AND PERILOUS ONE
MORE THAN THE PAIN I HAVE IN THINKING ON HIS SUFFERINGS THE ONE MAY PERHAPS ATONE FOR THE SINS OF THE OTHER AND YET HELP HIM TO REPENTANCE LIFE HERE AT LANGLEY WAS MORE ENCOURAGING THAN THE FURTIVE EXISTENCE NECESSARY IN THE NORTH OF DERBYSHIRE
HERE AT THE FORK THE PARTY HALTED TO TAKE LEAVE COMMODORE WAUGH CALLED HIS NIECE TO RIDE UP TO THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND GAVE HER MANY MESSAGES FOR COLONEL FAIRLIE FOR FANNY AND FOR FANNY'S YOUNG BRIDEGROOM
THE LOWER COUNTIES OF MARYLAND WERE LEFT COMPARATIVELY UNPROTECTED OLD MEN WOMEN CHILDREN AND NEGROES WERE ALL THAT REMAINED IN CHARGE OF THE FARMS AND PLANTATIONS
SHE CALCULATED ALMOST WITHOUT MISTAKE AS WAS AFTERWARDS SHOWN NOT ONLY WHICH PRIESTS WERE IN DERBYSHIRE BUT WITHIN A VERY FEW MILES OF WHERE THEY WOULD BE AND AT WHAT TIME SHE SHOWED HALF SMILING
ALL THAT YOU HAD BEST DO IS TO REMAIN HERE A WEEK OR TWO AND NOT GO DOWN TO DERBY AGAIN FOR THE PRESENT I THINK THAT SHOWING OF YOURSELF OPENLY IN TOWNS HATH ITS DANGERS AS WELL AS ITS SAFEGUARDS MISTER JOHN GLANCED ROUND MARJORIE BOWED HER HEAD IN ASSENT
BUT ONLY SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING OUT THE EXPIRING LIGHT THE SOUND OF THE UNBARRING OF THE DOOR HAD DEPRIVED HER OF THE LAST REMNANT OF SELF CONTROL
HE INSPECTED THEM GRAVELY BUT WAS NOT INVITED TO TOUCH THEM THEN HIS HOST TOUCHED HIM ON THE BREAST WITH ONE FINGER AND RECOILED SMILING THIS IS MY MAGIC HE SAID JOHN HERE DOES NOT LIKE IT
AND FINALLY WAS PERMITTED TO RETIRE WITH A BULLET LODGED UNDER HIS SHOULDER BLADE A PIECE OF SILVER TREPANNED IN THE TOP OF HIS SKULL A DEEP SWORD CUT ACROSS HIS FACE FROM THE RIGHT TEMPLE OVER HIS NOSE TO THE LEFT CHEEK AND WITH THE HONORARY TITLE OF COMMODORE
SHE LAMENTED HOWEVER THE FEWNESS OF THE PRIESTS AND ATTRIBUTED TO THIS THE GROWING LAXITY OF MANY FAMILIES LIVING IT MIGHT BE IN UPLAND FARMS OR IN INACCESSIBLE PLACES
AND WHEN AT THE CALL OF SOCIAL DUTY SHE DID GO INTO COMPANY SHE EXERCISED A REFINING AND SUBDUING INFLUENCE INVOLUNTARY AS IT WAS POTENT YET IN THAT LOVELY FRAGILE FORM IN THAT DREAMING POETICAL SOUL
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT TO MORROW HE WAS TO RIDE BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY WHENCE HE HAD FLED FOR FEAR OF HIS LIFE SIX WEEKS AGO
AND OF THE QUEEN'S NOBLE BEARING UPON THE SCAFFOLD HER UTTER FEARLESSNESS HER PROTESTATIONS THAT SHE DIED FOR HER RELIGION AND FOR THAT ONLY AND OF THE PESTERINGS OF DOCTOR FLETCHER DEAN OF PETERBOROUGH WHO HAD AT LAST GIVEN OVER IN DESPAIR AND PRAYED INSTEAD
OR AS HIS ENERGETIC COMPLAINTS OF ILL LUCK COULD MAKE THEM HE HAD DRAWN HIS SWORD IN ALMOST EVERY QUARREL OF HIS TIME ON EVERY BATTLEFIELD IN EUROPE TO FIND HIMSELF AT THE END OF HIS MILITARY CAREER NO RICHER THAN HE WAS AT ITS BEGINNING
MISTRESS MANNERS HE SAID YOU REMEMBER MY SPEAKING TO YOU AFTER FOTHERINGAY OF A FELLOW OF MY LORD SHREWSBURY'S WHO HONOURED ME WITH HIS SUSPICIONS SHE NODDED I HAVE NEVER SET EYES ON HIM FROM THAT DAY TO THIS TO THIS HE ADDED
EXCEPT WHERE FAR OFF IN THE WEST BEYOND THE TALL TREES OF THE PARK A FEW RED STREAKS LINGERED HE FELT OPPRESSED AND MISERABLE
AND ROBIN AFTER TELLING HIS TALE ANSWERED QUESTION AFTER QUESTION TILL SILENCE FELL AND ALL SAT MOTIONLESS THINKING OF THE WOMAN WHO WHILE DEAD YET SPOKE THEN MISTER JOHN STOOD UP CLAPPED THE PRIEST ON THE BACK
YOU MUST KEEP HIM TO HIS ROUTE
SOBBED JENNY NOW COMPLETELY BROKEN DOWN BY HER TERRORS
BASKETS OF POULTRY BARRELS OF PROVISIONS BOXES OF PROPERTY AND MEN AND MAID SERVANTS HURRYING WILDLY ABOUT AMONG THEM CARRYING TRUNKS AND PARCELS LOADING CARTS TACKLING HARNESS
HE ESCAPED TO SPANISH AMERICA WHERE HE LED FOR YEARS A SORT OF BUCCANEER LIFE
HOW THE DOG WAS TAKEN AWAY AND WASHED AND GIVEN AFTERWARDS INTO MISTER MELVILLE'S CHARGE HOW THE BODY AND THE HEAD HAD BEEN TAKEN UPSTAIRS HAD BEEN ROUGHLY EMBALMED AND LAID IN A LOCKED CHAMBER HOW HER SERVANTS HAD BEEN FOUND PEEPING THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
BUT THAT STRIKES AT THE DOCTRINE OF FREE WILL CRIED THE PRIEST NO SIR I THINK IT DOES NOT GOD'S FOREKNOWLEDGE DOTH NOT HINDER THE USE OF OUR FREE WILL WHICH IS A MYSTERY NO DOUBT YET NONE THE LESS TRUE
THE LETTER ENDED WITH MESSAGES TO THE PARTY WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THEIR WAY OF RETURN IF THEY SHOULD COME WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK AND WITH THE EXPLANATION GIVEN ABOVE OF THE SERIES OF MISFORTUNES BY WHICH ANY CAME TO BE AT PADLEY THAT NIGHT
PASSED THROUGH A LIFE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL VICISSITUDES WONDERFUL EVEN FOR THOSE DAYS OF ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE
I KNEW THAT A PRINCE
WHEN WHO SHOULD COME BY BUT A PARTY OF MEN AND MY LORD SHREWSBURY IN THE MIDST RIDING WITH MISTER ROGER COLUMBELL AND IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THEM MY FRIEND OF THE NEW INN OF FOTHERINGAY IT WAS ALL THE ILL FORTUNE IN THE WORLD THAT IT SHOULD BE AT SUCH MOMENT
OR A RICH PLANTATION HOUSE ILL DEFENDED THIS JACKAL WAS SURE TO SCENT OUT THE GAME FOR HIS MASTER THE LION AND MANY WERE THE COMELY MAIDENS AND YOUTHFUL WIVES SEIZED AND CARRIED OFF BY THIS MONSTER THE PATUXENT AND THE WICOMICO
BUT JUST AS WE READ IN THE SKY AT MORNING IF IT BE RED OR YELLOW WHETHER IT WILL BE FOUL OR FAIR SO I HOLD THAT GOD HAS WRITTEN OTHER SECRETS OF HIS IN OTHER THINGS AND THAT BY OBSERVING THEM AND JUDGING RIGHTLY WE MAY GUESS WHAT HE HAS IN STORE
WELL I STOPPED TO SPEAK WITH THESE TWO THE YOUNG MAN HATH LEFT MISTER MELVILLE'S SERVICE A WHILE BACK IT SEEMS AND IS TO TRY HIS FORTUNE IN FRANCE
HE CARRIED IT IN HIS HAND EVERY DAY IN THE MORNING HE COULD NOT BE SURE BUT THAT HE WOULD BE FLEEING BEFORE EVENING AS HE FELL ASLEEP HE COULD NOT BE SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT BE AWAKENED TO A NEW DREAM
AND THAT THERE WAS SOME LIMIT AFTER ALL TO WHAT GOD ALMIGHTY SHOULD DEMAND MARJORIE HAD CRIED OUT JUST NOW DRIVEN BEYOND HERSELF AT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT ALL THIS MUST MEAN FOR THE CATHOLICS OF THE COUNTRYSIDE
DECLARING THAT HE HAD DONE ALL THAT A MAN COULD DO
BUT THEIR REST OF SECURITY WAS BROKEN BY A TREMENDOUS SHOCK THE BRITISH FLEET UNDER ADMIRAL SIR A COCKBURN SUDDENLY ENTERED THE CHESAPEAKE AND THE QUIET LONELY SHORES OF THE BAY
MISTER BASSETT HAD A CONFIDENT WAY WITH HIM THAT WAS LIKE WINE TO FAINTING HEARTS AND HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BE CONFIDENT SINCE UP TO THE PRESENT BEYOND BEING FORCED TO PAY THE USUAL FINES FOR RECUSANCY HE HAD SCARCELY BEEN TROUBLED AT ALL
HE WAS SO PLEASED WITH THE BEAUTY GRANDEUR RICHNESS AND PROMISE OF THE PLACE
LAY HEAVY UPON EDITH'S TENDER HEART IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF POOR OLD LUCKENOUGH DESERTED AT ITS UTMOST NEED TO THE RAVAGES OF THE FOE THEN CAME THE QUESTION IF IT WERE NOT POSSIBLE IN CASE OF THE HOUSE BEING ATTACKED TO SAVE IT EVEN FOR HER TO SAVE IT
THAT HE MIGHT DAMN HIS OWN SOUL ETERNALLY
TO THEIR GRACES OF FRANCE AND HAD MOST WISELY REMAINED THERE EVER SINCE SO THE PARTY SAT ROUND THE FIRE IN THE SAME LITTLE PARLOUR WHERE THEY HAD SAT SO OFTEN BEFORE
STANDS THE ANCIENT MANOR HOUSE OF LUCKENOUGH THE TRADITIONS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSERT THE ORIGIN OF THE MANOR AND ITS QUAINT HAPPY AND NOT UNMUSICAL NAME TO HAVE BEEN BRIEFLY THIS
WOMEN INFANTS AND NEGROES A UNIVERSAL PANIC SEIZED THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOTHING OCCURRED TO THE DEFENSELESS PEOPLE BUT INSTANT FLIGHT FEMALES AND CHILDREN WERE HASTILY PUT INTO CARRIAGES THE MOST VALUABLE ITEMS OF PLATE OR MONEY HASTILY PACKED UP
AND I WOULD HAVE YOU NOTICE THAT HERE ARE MISTER FITZ HERBERT AND YOUR REVERENCE TOO FLEEING FOR YOUR LIVES AND HERE SIT I SAFE AT HOME AND ALL AS I HOLD BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBSERVE BY MY MAGIC WHAT IS TO COME TO PASS
IF I MEET THE ENEMY AND SAVE THE HOUSE THEY WILL SAY THAT EDITH LANCE IS A HEROINE
EDITH PASSED HER SLENDER FINGERS THROUGH HER CURLS STRINGING THEM OUT AS WAS HER WAY WHEN ABSENT IN THOUGHT SHE WAS TURNING THE WHOLE MATTER OVER IN HER MIND SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY SAVE THE MANSION THOUGH THESE TWO OLD PEOPLE WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO DO SO
THOMAS KNOWS THAT I AM AT PADLEY AND THAT MISTER EYRE WILL COME IN THERE FOR CANDLEMAS THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW IN THAT I RECOGNIZE MY SON'S KNOWLEDGE WELL I WILL DISPATCH MY MAN WHO BROUGHT THE NEWS TO MISTER EYRE TO BID HIM TO AVOID THE PLACE AND WE TWO MISTER ALBAN AND MYSELF
I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE DANGER EDITH ON REACHING LUCKENOUGH RETIRED TO BED AND ADDRESSED HERSELF TO SLEEP IT WAS IN VAIN HER NERVES WERE FEARFULLY EXCITED IN VAIN SHE TRIED TO COMBAT HER TERRORS THEY COMPLETELY OVERMASTERED HER
ROBIN LOOKED ROUND HIM IN WONDER HE HAD NO IDEA THAT HIS HOST WAS A MAN OF SUCH LEARNING ALL THE BOOKS ARE RANGED IN THEIR PROPER PLACES WENT ON THE OTHER
IN THE ROOM STOOD OLD OLIVER GRAY WITH TERROR WHILE ALL THE DOGS ON THE PREMISES WERE BARKING MADLY AND A NOISY PARTY AT THE FRONT WAS TRYING TO FORCE AN ENTRANCE VIOLENT KNOCKING AND SHAKING AT THE OUTER DOOR AND THE SOUND OF VOICES
ROBIN LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM IT WAS DARK OUTSIDE LONG AGO THEY HAD SUPPED AT SUNSET AND SAT FOR HALF AN HOUR OVER THEIR BANQUET OF SWEETMEATS AND WINE BEFORE COMING UPSTAIRS AND THE ROOM TOO WAS AS DARK AS NIGHT
WHICH IN SPITE OF HIS COURAGE HAD COME DOWN ON HIM SOMETIMES IN SOME LONELY FARM PERHAPS WHERE FLIGHT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR IN WHAT WAS FAR MORE DANGEROUS IN SOME CROWDED INN WHERE EVERY MOVEMENT WAS KNOWN
I DO NOT HOLD THAT WE ARE SO RULED BY THESE THAT WE HAVE NO ACTION OF OUR OWN ANY MORE THAN WE ARE COMPELLED TO BE WET THROUGH BY RAIN OR SCORCHED BY THE SUN WE MAY ALWAYS COME INTO A HOUSE OR SHELTER BENEATH A TREE AND THUS ESCAPE THEM SO TOO I HOLD WITH THE STARS
BACK TO LUCKENOUGH TO GUARD THE DEAR OLD HOUSE AND TAKE CARE OF YOU TWO
YET HE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE FAILED
HAD BEEN REWARDED ALSO BY ELIZABETH AND THAT THE NATURE OF HIS SERVICES WAS UNMISTAKABLE WHILE ALL THE REST OF THEM WHO HAD REFUSED UTTERLY TO TAKE ANY PART IN THE INSOLENT MOURNING AT PETERBOROUGH EITHER IN THE CATHEDRAL OR AT THE BANQUET
HE ENTERTAINED PRIESTS AND REFUGEES OF ALL KINDS FREELY ALTHOUGH DISCREETLY AND HE LAUGHED AT THE NOTION THAT THE PERSECUTION COULD BE
AND THAT HIS OWN TAKING HE PUTS DOWN TO HIS BROTHER'S ACCOUNT AS YOURSELF SIR ALSO DID THE MEN DID NO GREAT HARM IN PADLEY BEYOND BREAKING A PANEL OR TWO
THEN AS I WOULD NEVER HAVE ANY PART IN THE DEATH OF A PRIEST FOR HIS RELIGION ANOTHER WAS APPOINTED TO CARRY THE EXECUTION THROUGH
OR PLAYED AT FORMING JUVENILE MILITARY COMPANIES THE FARMS AND PLANTATIONS WERE CULTIVATED CHIEFLY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF LADIES WHOSE HUSBANDS SONS AND BROTHERS WERE ABSENT WITH THE ARMY NO ONE THOUGHT OF DANGER TO SAINT MARY'S
CHAPTER ONE LUCKENOUGH
AND OF HOUSES WHERE HE HAD SAID MASS AND I KNOW NOT WHAT ELSE
ASKED HER GROOM OLIVER NOW SPEAKING FOR THE FIRST TIME BACK TO LUCKENOUGH
MISTER COLUMBELL HIMSELF CAME WITH A SCORE OF MEN AND SURROUNDED THE HOUSE VERY EARLY HAVING SET WATCHERS ALL IN PLACE THE EVENING BEFORE THEY HAD MADE CERTAIN THEY SHOULD CATCH THE MASTER AND AT LEAST A PRIEST OR TWO
BUT I HAVE VERY HEAVY NEWS FOR ALL THAT FOR THERE HAD COME TO THE HOUSE AFTER DARK MISTER ANTHONY FITZ HERBERT WITH TWO OF HIS SISTERS MISSUS THOMAS FITZ HERBERT AND MISTER FENTON HIMSELF
OPEN OPEN LET US IN FOR GOD'S SAKE LET US IN
BECAME THE SCENE OF A WARFARE SCARCELY PARALLELED IN ATROCITY IN ANCIENT OR MODERN TIMES IF AMONG THE MARAUDING BAND OF LICENSED PIRATES AND ASSASSINS THERE WAS ONE NAME MORE DREADED MORE LOATHED AND ACCURSED THAN THE REST
ANY ROOM IN THE WORLD A SHELF RAN ROUND THE ROOM HIGH ON THE WALL AND WAS PILED WITH MANUSCRIPTS TO THE CEILING BENEATH THE BOOK SHELVES THAT RAN NEARLY ROUND THE ROOM WERE PACKED WITH VOLUMES
INQUIRED THE PRIEST CURIOUSLY FOR HE WAS NOT SURE WHETHER THE MAN WAS SERIOUS WELL SIR I HOLD THAT GOD HAS WRITTEN HIS WILL IN THE STARS AND IN THE BURNING OF HERBS AND IN THE SHINING OF THE SUN AND SUCH THINGS THERE IS NO BLACK MAGIC HERE
UNTIL THE BREAKING OUT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR WHEN HE TOOK SERVICE WITH PAUL JONES THE AMERICAN SEA KING
COMMODORE AND MISSUS WAUGH ENTERED THE FAMILY CARRIAGE WHICH THEY PRETTY WELL FILLED UP MISSUS WAUGH'S WOMAN SAT UPON THE BOX BEHIND AND THE COMMODORE'S MAN DROVE THE COACH AND THE WHOLE FAMILY PARTY SET FORWARD ON THEIR JOURNEY
BUT IF I FAIL AND LOSE MY LIFE THEY WILL SAY THAT EDITH WAS A CRACKED BRAINED GIRL WHO DESERVED HER FATE AND THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS PREDICTED SHE WOULD COME TO A BAD END BETTER GO ON TO HAY HILL MISS EDY DEED FORE MARSTER BETTER GO TO HAY HILL
I THINK YOU WILL FIND ALL THE MONEY READY FOR YOU IN THE WAY OF BETS THAT YOU WILL WANT OUR POPULATION IS MADE UP A GREAT DEAL AS YOU KNOW LARGELY OF MINERS AND RANCHERS AND THEY ARE INCLINED TO BET RECKLESSLY
I GLUED A LOT OF RATTLES TOGETHER AND BY TAKING OFF THE BUTTONS IT WAS PRETTY HARD TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE JOINED THIS RATTLE WAS MORE THAN A FOOT LONG THERE WAS ANOTHER EASTERN CHAP WANTED AN IBEX WHICH HE SAID WAS FOUND UP IN THESE MOUNTAINS
MAY THE BEST MAN WIN YOURS ET CETERA
MY CANVAS COAT SHIRT AND TROUSERS AND SOME THIN UNDERCLOTHES CONSTITUTED MY ENTIRE WARDROBE AND BY CAREFULLY CUTTING THEM INTO STRIPS WIDE ENOUGH TO BEAR MY WEIGHT AND YET NARROW ENOUGH TO GIVE SUFFICIENT LENGTH
MOST REPREHENSIBLE AND THERE IS NO MONEY IN IT BECAUSE YOU ARE DEAD SURE TO GET FOUND OUT
HE HOWEVER WAS FIGHTING MAD AND EVIDENTLY DID NOT ENJOY THE OPERATION WHICH HE HAD UNDERGONE
AND I TELL YOU THE OLD RUIN THEY CALL MONTEZUMA'S CASTLE IS A DANDY AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT THE CASTLE IS BUILT ON A LEDGE HIGH UP ON THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN WHICH HANGS OVER AT THE TOP THE ONLY WAY TO GET UP IS BY LADDERS OR ROPES
HE TRAVELLED ABOUT THE COUNTRY GIVING EXHIBITIONS WITH HIS SNAKES AND SELLING THE RATTLESNAKE CURE WHICH WAS PUT UP IN SMALL BOTTLES CONTAINING A BROWN COLORED LIQUID WHICH HE CLAIMED HE MADE FROM A PLANT WHICH WAS A SURE CURE FOR THE BITE OF THE RATTLESNAKE
THERE WERE NUMEROUS BITS OF BROKEN POTTERY SCATTERED ABOUT AND ONE NEARLY PERFECT SPECIMEN BESIDES THESE THERE WAS A VERY INTERESTING BIT OF STONE CARVING THESE THINGS I GATHERED TOGETHER AND PLACED IN A HEAP NEAR THE ENTRANCE
IT WAS EVIDENTLY HIS INTENTION TO LEAVE ME SAFELY HOUSED IN A PLACE FROM WHICH I COULD NEVER ESCAPE ALIVE AND START OFF THE PROUD OWNER OF THE TWO WAGONS FIVE HORSES AND VARIOUS VALUABLES WHICH HE BELIEVED MY BOXES TO CONTAIN
AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FEELING WHICH CAME OVER ME AS I SWUNG MYSELF CLEAR OF THE LEDGE AND HUNG SWAYING ON THAT IMPROVISED ROPE WHICH SEEMED TO STRETCH AND GROW THIN IN A WAY WHICH SENT COLD SHIVERS RUNNING UP AND DOWN MY SPINE IT SEEMED A YEAR BEFORE I REACHED THE LEDGE
WITH WHICH I HOPED I COULD SUCCEED IN REACHING THE SECOND LADDER WITHOUT BROKEN BONES
I MAY ADD THAT HE IS A PERSONAL FRIEND OF OUR VICE PRESIDENT MISTER ROBINSON
FOR THE FIRST MINUTE OR TWO NOTHING WAS DONE FORWARD AND BACK THEY MOVED THEIR ARMS MOVING IN AND OUT
MY WHOLE THOUGHTS WERE CONCENTRATED ON THE ONE DESIRE SOMETHING TO DRINK I THOUGHT AND PONDERED TRYING TO THINK OF SOME POSSIBLE WAY TO GET DOWN
HE DOCTORED UP A LOT OF HUMMING BIRDS TOO
IT REACHED HIM SAFELY BUT WHILE HE WAS UNTYING IT I CARELESSLY DROPPED THE END OF THE STRING I WENT BACK HOWEVER AND GATHERED UP THE OTHER RELICS INTENDING TO TAKE SOME OF THEM DOWN WITH ME AND THEN COME BACK FOR THE REST IF I COULD NOT MANAGE THEM ALL THE FIRST TIME
BRIGHT AND SHINING EVEN AFTER THE CANYON HAD BECOME QUITE DARK
I THINK I SENT HIM SOME THAT PLEASED HIM ANYHOW HE PAID FOR THEM ALL RIGHT I HAD A CUSTOMER WHO WANTED A RATTLESNAKE WITH A VERY BIG RATTLE AND I FIXED UP A SNAKE FOR HIM ON THIS TRIP AND SENT IT TO HIM AFTERWARDS IT HAD ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN RATTLES
I WAS STARK NAKED EXCEPTING MY SHOES
AMONG THE BIRDS HE BROUGHT BACK WERE A LOT OF SKINS OF THE BLUE CHATTERER THE ONE WITH THE PURPLE THROAT YOU KNOW
IT WAS AS I SAID IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTY NINE A
MY REVOLVER WAS STILL IN MY BELT AND HASTILY PULLING IT I COMMENCED SHOOTING AT THE RUNNING FIGURE NOW SOME SIXTY OR SEVENTY YARDS DISTANT
MONTEZUMA'S CASTLE NO SAID THE CURIOSITY DEALER THAT MUMMY IS NOT FOR SALE I HAD TOO BIG A JOB TO GET IT TELL ME ABOUT IT I ASKED THE CURIOSITY DEALER CAREFULLY CLOSED AND LOCKED THE CASE
AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE I WAS CAREFUL AND DID NOT HURRY MATTERS AND THE CAVE WAS LIKE AN OVEN WRAPPING THE LITTLE MUMMY CAREFULLY IN A BIG HANDKERCHIEF WHICH I HAD TIED ROUND MY NECK
OF COURSE I GOT DOWN THE REST OF THE WAY ALL RIGHT OR I WOULDN'T BE HERE BUT I DON'T KNOW AS I WOULD HAVE DONE IT IF ANTONIO HAD PULLED DOWN THE SECOND LADDER INSTEAD OF THE BOTTOM ONE
THERE WERE SEVERAL OF US IN THE PARTY
AND IS QUITE CLEVER HE'S A GUNSMITH BY PROFESSION
I THEN WENT BACK AND TAKING A SMALL HATCHET WHICH I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME
DON'T TOUCH ME I AM GOING TO DIE I'M GOING TO DIE AND SAY WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DID DIE
AND THE OTHER WOULD SPRING BACK WITH THE AGILITY OF A DANCING MASTER SUDDENLY THE FINANCIER THOUGHT HE SAW AN OPENING AND LET GO HIS LEFT BUT WAS SHORT
I MIGHT AS WELL GET HIM AN IBEX AS ANYBODY ELSE EVEN IF I HAD TO MAKE ONE BUT TO GET BACK TO MY STORY
HERE MY FIRST LADDER WAS PUT UP TWO SMALL LEDGES ABOVE THIS SOME THREE FEET APART AND A WIDER LEDGE FOUR FEET HIGHER ALLOWED ME TO CLIMB UP WITHOUT THE USE OF LADDERS TO ANOTHER LEDGE FROM HERE I RAN ANOTHER SMALL LADDER UP TO A LEDGE WHICH WAS BETWEEN TWO AND THREE FEET WIDE
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NOT EVEN A STRING TO AID ME IN GETTING DOWN THERE WAS NO USE HOPING FOR HELP FROM ANY ONE FOR THE PLACE WAS RARELY VISITED AND IT MIGHT BE WEEKS BEFORE ANY PERSON WOULD DISCOVER THAT I WAS THERE I WAS GETTING MORE THIRSTY ALL THE TIME
I SUCCEEDED IN MAKING TWO VERY GOOD LADDERS ONE FOURTEEN FEET LONG WITH THE TWO TOP POLES ONE FROM EACH TENT AND TWO SMALL LADDERS EACH ABOUT SEVEN FEET I MADE THESE LAST FROM THE FOUR UPRIGHT TENT POLES THERE BEING TWO TO EACH TENT AS YOU KNOW
STRANGE TO SAY I WAS NOT HUNGRY
AND COMMENCED TO CURSE ANTONIO FOR HIS CARELESSNESS BUT IMAGINE MY HORROR WHEN I SAW HIM THROW DOWN THE BOTTOM LADDER AND THEN RUN AS FAST AS HE COULD TOWARDS THE CAMP MY FIRST AND ONLY THOUGHT WAS TO PAY ANTONIO FOR HIS TREACHERY
BUT I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO TRUST TO IT IT WAS THAT OR NOTHING AND NOTHING MEANT DEATH FROM THIRST IN A VERY SHORT TIME I SUCCEEDED IN FIXING THE HATCHET FIRMLY INTO AND ACROSS A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE IT WAS SPLIT
HE TOOK THE PRECAUTION HOWEVER WHILE THE SNAKE LAY HELPLESS WITH ITS MOUTH OPEN TO CAREFULLY WASH THE TEETH AND THEN FILLED THE SMALL OPENINGS NEAR THE END OF THE FANGS WITH SOME DENTAL CEMENT WHICH BAKER HAD IN HIS OUTFIT
WHILE I WAS LOOKING THEM OVER I HEARD A CRASH AND THE SOUND OF TUMBLING STONES
THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF WAS ROUGH AND THE FIRST FIFTEEN FEET OR SO WE COULD CLIMB EASILY TO A BROAD LEDGE THEN THERE CAME A SPACE BETWEEN NINE AND TEN FEET IN HEIGHT
ANTONIO OH YES HE IS THERE YET I BELIEVE
BAKER PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD SEE HOW MUCH FAITH MIGUEL HAD IN HIS OWN ANTIDOTE
FOR A FEW MINUTES IT SHONE A FIERY RED AND THEN THE LIGHT WAS GONE LIKE A HUGE TORCH WHICH FLICKERS AND GOES OUT THEN THE NIGHT NOISES COMMENCED THE INCESSANT MADDENING CROAKING OF THE FROGS AND NOW AND THEN AN OWL
IT LOOKED VERY CLEAR AND REFRESHING I THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND THE MORE I THOUGHT THE MORE HOPELESS IT SEEMED TO ME TO PLAN A WAY TO GET DOWN ALIVE
I HAD NO SOONER ENTERED THAN I FELT PRETTY SURE IT HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY BEEN VISITED BY ANY ONE SINCE THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS LEFT IT THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TO TAKE A STOUT PIECE OF TWINE FROM MY POCKET AND FASTEN THE END OF THE LADDER TO A PIECE OF ROCK THEN I FELT EASIER
AND ONE DAY A CHAP CAME INTO OUR CAMP
BUT I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO STAY ON IT EVEN IF MY LEGS WERE NOT BROKEN BY THE FALL
BUT YET I WILL SAY ONE WORD TO THEE ERE WE SUNDER TO WIT THAT TO MY MIND THE HOLY LADY WILL LOVE NO ONE BUT THE SAINTS OF HEAVEN SAVE IT BE SOME MAN WITH WHOM ALL WOMEN ARE IN LOVE THEREWITH HE TURNED AWAY SUDDENLY
BUT NOT MUCH FOR HE DEEMED THAT HER GOODWILL TO HIM WAS ABUNDANT WHICH INDEED IT WAS NOW SHE LOOKS ON HIM AND SAYS TRULY IT DOES MY HEART GOOD TO SEE THEE BUT THOU POOR BOY THOU ART WEARING THYSELF WITH THY LONGING
HE SHALL COME WITH ME WILL HE NILL HE UNARMED AND AS A PRISONER AND THE SPOIL OF MY VALIANCY AND HE LAUGHED NOT ALTOGETHER IN BITTERNESS BUT AS IF SOME JOY WERE RISING IN HIS HEART NOW MY QUEEN SAID HE
SCOWLING AND HIS FACE WHITE AS CHALK THEN HE SPAKE TO HER COLDLY AND STERNLY STRETCHING OUT HIS BLOODY SWORD BEFORE HER I HAVE DONE THY BIDDING AND SLAIN MY VERY EARTHLY FRIEND OF FRIENDS FOR THY SAKE
THUS THEY ABODE FOR ABOUT THE SPACE OF ONE MINUTE AND MEANWHILE THE BIG MAN ROSE UP ON ONE KNEE AND STEADIED HIM WITH HIS SWORD FOR A MOMENT OF TIME AND THE BLADE WAS BLOODY FROM THE POINT HALF WAY UP TO THE HILT
SHE KNIT HER BROW AND SPAKE ANGRILY LEAVE TO DEPART SHE SAID THEN AFTER A WHILE AND IN A KINDER VOICE AND THUS MUCH OF MY LOVE THAT I PRAY THEE NOT TO SORROW FOR ME BUT TO HAVE A GOOD HEART
THOU FAIR MAN AND DOTH SO WITH HER RAIMENT THAT THOU MAYST BEST SEE HOW SHAPELY SHE IS OF LIMB AND FOOT AND TOYETH HER RIGHT HAND WITH HER LEFT WRIST AND THE LIKE WELL AS FOR ME I HAVE HAD MORE LOVERS THAN ONE OR TWO
FOR THE WORDS THAT HE HAD HEARD HE HEEDED NOT SAVE AS THEY MADE PICTURES FOR HIM OF THE WAYS OF THAT WOMAN OF THE FOREST SO THEY WENT ON SOBERLY TILL THE PRIEST LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ABOUT LIKE ONE COME OUT OF SLUMBER AND SAID IN A FIRM VOICE
AND ASKED HIM WHITHER HE WOULD SAID THE PRIEST I AM FOR THE LITTLE PLAIN AND THE LAND OF ABUNDANCE WHENCE ART THOU MY SON AND WHITHER WILT THOU FROM THAT VERY LAND I COME SAID RALPH AND AS TO WHITHER
OLD AND YOUNG WEIGH IN THY MIND BESIDE THE WORD I TELL THEE OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND KNOW CONCERNING THIS MOST EXCELLENT OF LADIES I TROW NOT AND FOR MY PART I TELL THEE THAT THOUGH SHE IS VERILY AS FAIR AS VENUS GOD SAVE US
BESIDES HE DEEMED THAT THE LADY MIGHT COME THAT DAY WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN THE CASTLE AND THAT HIMSEEMED WOULD MAKE THE MEETING SWEETER YET SO HE YEA SAID THE CARLINE'S ASKING JOYOUSLY AND IN AN HOUR'S TIME SHE WENT HER WAYS AND LEFT HIM ALONE THERE
AND THE GUARDIAN OF ALL POOR FOLK ASK THE CARLES ELSE RALPH HELD HIS PEACE AND ROSE TO BE GONE AND TURNING SAW THE DAMSEL WADING THE SHALLOW FORD AND LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER AT HIM HE GAVE THE DAME GOOD DAY
AND TO DAY IT WILL BE HANDY IF THOU ABIDEST FOR I HAVE AN ERRAND TO MY BROTHER IN THE FLESH WHO IS ONE OF THE BRETHREN OF THE THORN OVER YONDER IF THOU WILT GIVE ME LEAVE IT WILL BE TO MY PLEASURE AND GAIN RALPH WAS GLAD WHEN HE HEARD THIS DEEMING THAT IF SHE LEFT HIM ALONE THERE
SAINT ANTHONY BY NIGHT AND CLOUD SO THAT FEW MIGHT SEE HER OBEDIENT TO THE SCRIPTURE WHICH SAYETH LET NOT THY RIGHT HAND KNOW WHAT THY LEFT HAND DOETH AND SHE BAREFOOT IN HER SMOCK AMIDST THE RUGGED WOOD
SO THAT HE STIRRED SOMEWHAT AND THE COLOUR CAME INTO HIS FACE A LITTLE THEN SHE BADE GATHER STORE OF BRACKEN FOR A BED FOR THE BLACK KNIGHT AND RALPH BESTIRRED HIMSELF THEREIN BUT THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN SAT LOOKING AT THE LADY AS SHE BUSIED HERSELF WITH HIS FRIEND
AND LET THIS YOUNG MAN DEPART UNHURT WHETHER THOU MADEST HIM OR HAST BUT LED HIM AWAY FROM COUNTRY AND FRIENDS AND ALL THEN DO THOU COME WITH ME AND MAKE SOME SEMBLANCE OF LOVING ME AND SUFFER ME TO LOVE THEE
AMIDST SUCH THOUGHTS HE CAME INTO THE WOOD AND MADE HIS WAY BY THE PATHS AND OPEN PLACES GOING SOUTH AND EAST OF THE HOUSE WHEREAS THE LAST DAY HE HAD GONE WEST AND NORTH HE WENT A SOFT PACE BUT WANDERED ON WITHOUT ANY STAY TILL IT WAS NOON
RALPH STAGGERED UP TO HIS FEET BUT WAS SO FEEBLE STILL THAT HE SANK DOWN AGAIN AND MUTTERED I MAY NOT I AM SICK AND FAINT AND THEREWITH SWOONED AWAY AGAIN BUT THE KNIGHT STOOD A WHILE LEANING ON HIS SWORD
FOR I PROMISE THEE NOT TO STIR OUT OF THE HOUSE WHILES THOU ART AWAY SAID RALPH NAY I WILL ABIDE HERE YEA SHE SAID I SEE THOU TRUSTEST ME NOT WELL NO MATTER
BEFORE HE SAW THE WESTERING SUN SHINE BRIGHTLY FROM A NAKED SWORD AND THEN ANOTHER SPRANG UP TO MEET IT AND HE HEARD FAINTLY THE CLASH OF STEEL
AND THY DOUBTING AND IF THOU WILT DO AFTER MY REDE THOU WILT CERTAINLY GO INTO THE WOOD TO MORROW AND SEE WHAT MAY BEFALL AND INDEED AND IN SOOTH THOU WILT LEAVE BEHIND THEE A TRUSTY FRIEND HE LOOKED ON HER KINDLY AND SMILED AND SAID
SHE SPAKE NOT BUT STOOD QUIETLY LOOKING ON HIM NOT UNKINDLY WHILE A WIND CAME UP FROM THE WATER AND PLAYED WITH A FEW LIGHT LOCKS OF HAIR THAT HUNG DOWN FROM THAT RUDDY CROWN AND BLEW HER RAIMENT FROM HER FEET AND WRAPPED IT CLOSE ROUND HER LIMBS
YET DID HE SEEM TO SEE HER BODY THROUGH THAT WHICH COVERED IT BUT NOW HER ATTIRE WAS BUT SIMPLE A GREEN GOWN THIN AND SHORT AND THEREOVER A COTE HARDY OF BLACK CLOTH WITH ORPHREYS OF GOLD AND COLOURS BUT ON HER NECK WAS A COLLAR THAT SEEMED TO HIM
YEA HE SAID GRIMLY WHEN THOU ART WEARY OF HIM O ART THOU NOT SHAMELESS AMONGST WOMEN YET MUST I NEEDS PAY THY PRICE THOUGH MY HONOUR AND THE WELFARE OF MY LIFE GO WITH IT
AND KEEN SIGHTED AS HE WAS COULD MAKE OUT THAT THREE MEN WERE ON THE HITHER SIDE OF THE OAK TREES AND ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THEM WAS A WHITE HORSE THITHERWARD THEN HE MADE STEALING FROM BUSH TO BUSH SINCE HE DEEMED THAT HE NEEDED NOT BE SEEN OF MEN WHO MIGHT BE FOES
THERE WAS SCARCE A SMILE ON HER FACE AS SHE SAID GENTLY ONE THING IS TO BE THOUGHT OF THAT WALTER'S SOUL IS NOT YET SO FAST IN HIS BODY THAT EITHER THOU OR SOME ROUGH HANDED LEECH MAY BE SURE OF HEALING HIM IT MUST BE THIS HAND
WAS BUT THE VERY SOOTH BUT THE KNIGHT SPAKE YOUNG MAN THOU HAST FOUGHT WITH ME THOU KNOWEST NOT WHEREFORE AND GRIM WAS MY MOOD WHEN THOU MADEST THINE ONSET
I TELL THEE MY SON THAT THOU MAYEST SET THY LOVE UPON HER WITHOUT SIN AND THEREWITH SUDDENLY HE FELL A WEEPING AND RALPH WAS ILL AT EASE OF HIS WEEPING
SO RALPH LOOKED AND SAW THAT THEY HAD STRIPPED THE KNIGHT OF HIS HAUBERK AND HELM AND BARED HIS BODY AND THAT THE LADY WAS DRESSING A GREAT AND SORE WOUND IN HIS SIDE NEITHER WAS HE COME TO HIMSELF AGAIN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AND VERY GOODLY TO LOOK ON
AND EVEN BEFORE I WAS OLD I WAS NOT YOUNG I AM NOW FOUL OF FAVOUR AND EVEN BEFORE I BECAME FOUL I WAS NOT SO FAIR WELL THEN YEA WHAT THEN SAID RALPH THIS THEN FAIR YOUNG FOOL SAID SHE
YET HOW IF HE HAVE NO WILL TO FARE WITH US SHE LAUGHED AND SAID THEN SHALT THOU HAVE HIM WITH THEE AS THY CAPTIVE AND THRALL HAST THOU NOT CONQUERED HIM IN BATTLE HE STOOD SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN HE SAID THOU SAYEST IT
AND ROSE UP HASTILY AND STOOD A LITTLE ALOOF AGAIN NOW RALPH SAT UP AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND WHEN HE SAW THE LADY HE FIRST BLUSHED RED AND THEN TURNED VERY PALE FOR THE FULL LIFE WAS IN HIM AGAIN AND HE KNEW HER AND LOVE DREW STRONGLY AT HIS HEART STRINGS
BUT NOW I BID THEE DRINK OF THIS WATER AND THEN DO OFF THINE HELM AND HAUBERK AND GIVE ME THY SWORD AND DAGGER AND GO WITH US PEACEABLY
AND HE COULD NOT MEET THE OLD WOMAN'S EYES AS SHE SPAKE THUS AND THE MAIDEN TOOK HERSELF OUT OF EARSHOT AT THE FIRST WORDS OF THE CARLINE HEREOF
AND HE WENT AND LAY DOWN IN HIS BED AND SLEPT AND DREAMED OF THE DAYS OF UPMEAD AND THINGS FORGOTTEN IN HIS WAKING TIME CAME BETWEEN HIM AND ANY MEMORIES OF HIS PRESENT LONGING AND THE DAYS THEREOF HE AWOKE AND AROSE BETIMES IN THE MORNING
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE LEECHCRAFT OF THE LADY MEANWHILE SHE WENT TO RALPH AND STOOD BY HIM WHO NOW BEGAN TO STIR AGAIN AND SHE KNELT DOWN BY HIM AND KISSED HIS FACE GENTLY
THEN GREW RALPH SHAMEFACED AND TURNED AWAY FROM HER AND MISCALLED HIMSELF FOR A FOOL AND A DASTARD
DREW HIMSELF UP STARK AND STIFF AND PRESSING ON THROUGH ALL RALPH'S STROKES THOUGH THEY RENT HIS MAIL HERE AND THERE RAN WITHIN HIS SWORD
WOULDST KEEP ME AWAY FROM ALL MEN YEA I KNOW WHAT THOU WOULDST SAY THOU WOULDST KEEP ME FROM SINNING AGAIN AND SHE SMILED BUT BITTERLY WELL THE TALE IS NO LONG ONE FIVE DAYS AGO
THE PRIEST MUTTERED SOMEWHAT AS HE PASSED WHICH RALPH CAUGHT NOT THE MEANING OF AND FELL MOODY AGAIN AND WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE PAST THE FORD HE DREW REIN AND SAID NOW SON I MUST TO MY CELL HARD BY THE CHURCH YONDER
BUT THOSE NOTHING TO THE POINT THEN THE LADY TOOK HER GAY EMBROIDERED CLOAK WHICH LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE OAK TREE AND CAST IT OVER HIM AND AS RALPH DEEMED
I HAVE SEEN THEE BEFORE YEA SHE SAID TWICE BEFORE FAIR KNIGHT HOW IS THAT HE SAID ONCE I SAW THEE THE FAIREST THING IN THE WORLD AND EVIL MEN WOULD HAVE LED THEE TO SLAUGHTER BUT NOT TWICE
NOW DEVIL LET SEE WHETHER THOU WILT BLEED BLACK THEREWITH HE RAISED UP HIS HAND BUT THE WEAPON WAS STAYED OR EVER IT FELL FOR THE LADY HAD GLIDED UP TO THEM WHEN SHE SAW THAT RALPH WAS OVERCOME
AS OTHERS HAVE DONE BEFORE THEE WELL WELL
AND SEEK TO SUNWAY THROUGH THE BLIND WOODLAND WHICH SHALL IT BE THE KNIGHT LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AND SAID YEA FAIR ONE THIS IS MUCH LIKE TO THE TALE OF THE CARLE AT THE FERRY WITH THE FOX AND THE GOAT AND THE CABBAGE
THEREAT RALPH'S HEART FELL AGAIN AND HE SAID SAYEST THOU MOTHER THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS ABIDING LIKE ME IN THE TOWER I KNOW NOT WHAT THY WORDS MEAN THE CARLINE LAUGHED
BUT NOW MUST WE SET FORTH ON OUR ROAD AND HERE IS WORK FOR THEE TO DO
RALPH SAID TO HIMSELF WHEN HE SAW HER DEPART THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE MORE JOY IN THE CASTLE OF HIS LADY IF HE WERE ALONE AND WOULD WEAR AWAY THE DAY IN BETTER PATIENCE THEREFOR BUT IN SOOTH THE HOURS OF THAT DAY WERE WORSE TO WEAR THAN ANY DAY THERE HAD YET BEEN
RUSHED ON HIS FOE AND SMOTE SO FIERCELY THAT HE FELL TO THE EARTH BEFORE HIM AND THE BIG MAN FELL UPON HIM AS HE FELL AND LET KNEE AND SWORD POMMEL AND FIST FOLLOW THE STROKE AND THERE THEY WALLOWED ON THE EARTH TOGETHER STRAIGHTWAY
THAT IT TOLD NOT WHENCE THAT LADY CAME NOR WHAT SHE WAS NOR AUGHT ELSE SAVE THAT THERE SHE WAS IN THE WOOD BY HERSELF AND WAS FOUND THEREIN BY THE KING'S SON
AND FOUND THE SADDLE BAGS ON HIM AND TOOK FROM THEM BREAD AND FLESH AND A FLASK OF GOOD WINE AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE LADY WHO LAUGHED AND SAID THOU ART A GOOD SEEKER AND NO ILL FINDER THEN SHE GAVE THE WOUNDED MAN TO DRINK OF THE WINE
AND GLOOM SEEMED GATHERING ON HIM AGAIN BUT WHEN THE BRACKEN WAS ENOUGH THE LADY MADE A BED DEFTLY AND SPEEDILY AND BETWEEN THE THREE THEY LAID THE WOUNDED MAN THEREON WHO SEEMED COMING TO HIMSELF SOMEWHAT AND SPAKE A FEW WORDS
AND ALL HAS GONE WELL BUT THE FOURTH TIME SHE WILL COME AND FIND ME GONE THE CARLINE LAUGHED WELL SHE SAID
THOU ART MERCIFUL MY QUEEN THOUGH NOT TO ME AND A CHURL WERE I IF I WERE LESS MERCIFUL THAN THOU THEREFORE
O NO I GRIEVE AT IT FOR ALL THAT I HAD SUCH GOOD CAUSE TO HATE HIM HE SAID MY OWN HEART MY OWN HEART HALF OF MY HEART BIDDETH ME SLAY THEE WHO HAST MADE ME SLAY HIM WHAT WILT THOU GIVE ME
AND HE LIFTED HIS HAND AGAIN BUT AGAIN SHE STAYED HIM AND SAID LOOK THOU I WILL BUY HIM OF THEE AND INDEED I OWE HIM A LIFE HOW IS THAT SAID HE WHY WOULDST THOU KNOW SHE SAID
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO AN ADVENTURE IN THE WOOD RALPH ARRAYED HIMSELF FOR DEPARTURE NEXT MORNING WITHOUT MORE WORDS AND WHEN HE WAS READY THE CARLINE SAID TO HIM
SAID HE NOT UNCOMPELLED SHE SAID IF THOU BIDDEST ME GO WITH THREATS OF HEWING AND MANGLING THE BODY WHICH THOU SAYEST THOU LOVEST NEEDS MUST I GO THEN YET SCARCE WILT THOU DO THIS
IT IS HER WAY HERE IN THE SUMMER TIDE TO BATHE HER IN YONDER POOL UP THE WATER AND IT WAS THE SAME POOL WHEREIN RALPH HAD BATHED AND SHE HATH ME AND MY NIECE AND TWO OTHER WOMEN TO HOLD UP THE SILKEN CLOTH BETWIXT HER BODY AND THE WORLD SO THAT I HAVE SEEN HER AS GOD MADE HER
THINE OWN HEART BADE THEE TO STRIVE WITH HIM BECAUSE THOU DEEMEDST THAT HE LOVED ME BE CONTENT THOU HAST SLAIN HIM WHO STOOD IN THY WAY AS THOU DEEMEDST
RALPH SAID NOUGHT BUT WAXED SHAMEFACED AS HE DEEMED THAT THE PRIEST EYED HIM CURIOUSLY AT LAST HE SAID I WILL ASK THEE A QUESTION IN TURN FATHER YEA SAID THE PRIEST SAID RALPH
THIS IS THE BARGAIN TO BE STRUCK BETWEEN US EVEN NOW THOU WOULDST NOT REFRAIN FROM SLAYING THIS YOUNG MAN UNLESS PERCHANCE HE SHOULD SWEAR TO DEPART FROM US AND AS FOR ME I WOULD NOT GO BACK WITH THEE TO SUNHOME
THEN SHALL SHE SHOW ME THE WAY TO THE WELL AT THE WORLD'S END AND I SHALL DRINK THEREOF AND NEVER GROW OLD EVEN AS SHE ENDURETH IN YOUTH AND SHE SHALL LOVE ME FOR EVER AND I HER FOR EVER SO HE THOUGHT
SAID THE KNIGHT WHERE DOST THOU COME FROM WHERE IS THINE HOME SAID RALPH UPMEADS WELL THEN QUOTH THE BIG KNIGHT GO BACK TO UPMEADS AND LIVE
AND SO ARRAYED FAIRER THAN ANY QUEEN IN A GOLDEN GOWN YEA AS FAIR AS THE WOODWIVES OF THE ANCIENT HEATHEN
BUT FROM WHOSE MOUTH FORSOOTH I WILL TELL THEE FROM A SORT OF IDLE JADES YOUNG WOMEN WHO WOULD BE THOUGHT FAIRER THAN THEY BE WHO ARE AFRAID OF EVERYTHING SAVE A NAKED MAN AND WHO CAN LIE EASIER THAN THEY CAN SAY THEIR PATERNOSTER
SO NOW I BID THEE REJOICE THAT THERE IS A GOOD KNIGHT MORE IN THE WORLD THAN WE DEEMED E E N NOW FOR THIS MY FRIEND WALTER THE BLACK IS ALIVE STILL YEA SAID THE LADY AND BELIKE HE SHALL LIVE A LONG WHILE YET
WHERE SHOULD I BE BUT HERE AH SHE SAID BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN NEVERTHELESS SHE WENT AND FETCHED HIS WAR GEAR AND LOOKED AT HIM FONDLY AS HE DID IT ON AND WENT HIS WAYS FROM THE HALL
BUT WHEN RALPH HAD TIED UP THOSE OTHER TWO STEEDS BY SILVERFAX AND DRAWN REAR TO THOSE TWAIN THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN LOOKED UP AT HIM AND SPAKE IN A CHEERFUL VOICE THOU SEEMEST TO BE NO ILL MAN THOUGH THOU HAST COME ACROSS MY LADY
BUT SHE LOOKED ON HIM KINDLY AND SAID TO HIM HOW FARES IT WITH THEE I AM SORRY OF THY HURT WHICH THOU HAST HAD FOR ME HE SAID FORSOOTH LADY A CHANCE KNOCK OR TWO IS NO GREAT MATTER FOR A LAD OF UPMEADS BUT OH
GENTRY AND PEOPLE OF ENGLAND WHO SUPPORTED THE DISABILITIES GENERALLY AND HER CAUSE IN PARTICULAR AMONG THESE NAMES WHICH WERE VERY NUMEROUS APPEARED THAT OF LADY GEORGE GERMAIN
AND WHY SHOULD SHE GO TO THE DEANERY WHO COULD SAY WHETHER THE DEAN WOULD LET HER COME AWAY AGAIN WHAT A FEATHER IT WOULD BE IN THE DEAN'S CAP IF THE NEXT POPENJOY WERE BORN AT THE DEANERY
TIME WAS WE COULD GIVE THEM WHO SERVED US SOMETHING BETTER THAN THANKS
WHICH WAS OF COURSE WRITTEN BY THAT DAY'S POST TO LORD GEORGE THERE WERE STILL TEN DAYS TO THE TRIAL AND TWENTY DAYS BY COMPUTATION TO THE GREAT EVENT THERE WERE OF COURSE
AND THE FOND SMILE AND CORDIAL EMBRACE WITH WHICH HE GREETED GLASTONBURY MORE THAN REPAID THAT GOOD MAN FOR ALL HIS EXERTIONS THERE WAS NOTWITHSTANDING A PERCEPTIBLE DEGREE OF CONSTRAINT BOTH ON THE PART OF THE BARONET
NEVER HAVING ENTERED THE HOUSE AT MANOR CROSS OR EVEN THE PARK SINCE HIS VISIT TO ITALY THE CONSTERNATION OF THE LADIES MAY BE IMAGINED POOR MARY WAS CERTAINLY NOT IN A CONDITION TO GO INTO A COURT OF LAW
ENCOUNTERED A TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT AND MISTER COELEBS WAS DRIVEN TO CONFESS HIS OWN DISGRACE HE HAD HE SAID NEVER UNDERTAKEN TO PAY THE COST OF THE TRIAL
THE NEXT MORNING THERE CAME A HEARTRENDING LETTER FROM AUNT JU SHE WAS VERY SORRY THAT LADY GEORGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO TROUBLED BUT THEN LET THEM THINK OF HER TROUBLE OF HER MISERY
LORD BROTHERTON HAD BEEN SUMMONED AND WOULD LORD BROTHERTON COME THEY ALL BELIEVED THAT HE WAS DYING AND IF SO SURELY HE COULD NOT BE MADE TO COME BUT IS IT NOT HORRIBLE SAID LADY SUSANNA
AFTER DINNER DURING WHICH FERDINAND RECOUNTED ALL HIS ADVENTURES LADY ARMINE INVITED HIM WHEN SHE ROSE TO WALK WITH HER IN THE GARDEN IT WAS THEN WITH AN AIR OF CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION
TO BE REALLY SERVICEABLE TO THOSE HE LOVES IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR HIM TO CEASE TO EXIST MAY YOU NEVER REPENT YOUR DEVOTION TO OUR HOUSE SAID SIR RATCLIFFE RISING FROM HIS SEAT
THEN SHE SAID SOME VERY SEVERE THINGS AGAINST THE DISABILITIES GENERALLY THERE WAS THAT WOMAN FLEABODY MAKING A FORTUNE IN THEIR HALL AND WOULD TAKE NONE OF THIS EXPENSE UPON HERSELF
SHE WAS HOWEVER OF OPINION THAT IF MARY WAS CONCEALED IN A CERTAIN ROOM AT MANOR CROSS WHICH MIGHT SHE THOUGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY WARMED AND VENTILATED FOR HEALTH
THAT BARONESS PROBABLY THINKS THAT SHE WILL GET MONEY OUT OF YOU IF THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST YOU MUST SEND A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE WILL THAT DO OF COURSE IT WILL WHEN GEORGE IS HERE WE WILL GET DOCTOR LOFTLY
AND WAS ASKED OUT TO DINNER THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK WHEREAS THE BARONESS WAS IN A VERY POOR CONDITION SHE HAD INDEED SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HERSELF INVITED TO MISTER DE BARON'S HOUSE AND FROM TIME TO TIME
AFTER HAVING BEEN HONOURED ON YOUR SIDE WITH A FRIENDSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN THE CONSOLATION AND CHARM OF MY EXISTENCE INDEED TOO GREAT A BLESSING I DID BELIEVE MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN I REMINDED MYSELF
OH GEORGE SHE SAID LOOK HERE WHAT RIGHT HAVE THEY TO SAY SO I NEVER PATRONISED ANYTHING I WENT THERE ONCE WHEN I CAME TO LONDON FIRST BECAUSE MISS MILDMAY ASKED ME YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE
THE JUDGES OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND HER THE BABY IN THAT CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN AT MANOR CROSS
WITH A CARRIAGE FULL OF PRECAUTIONS WAS SENT INTO THE DEANERY TO MEET HIM THE MARCHIONESS DISCOVERED THAT THE JOURNEY WAS TO BE MADE AND WAS FULL OF MISGIVINGS AND FULL OF ENQUIRIES
OF THE UNRESTRAINED MANNER IN WHICH I HAD AVAILED MYSELF OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THAT FRIENDSHIP I DID BELIEVE ACTUATED BY FEELINGS WHICH PERHAPS I CANNOT DESCRIBE AND THOUGHTS TO WHICH I CANNOT NOW GIVE UTTERANCE THAT I MIGHT VENTURE WITHOUT OFFENCE
ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS AT LARGE SHE COULD TEACH LESSONS INFINITELY SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING THAT HAD COME FROM THAT IMPUDENT BUT IMBECILE AMERICAN
IT WAS FOUND TO BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE FROM HER WITHOUT LEAVING SOME AMOUNT OF MONEY IN HER HANDS AND THEN IN A HAPPY HOUR SHE CAME AT LAST ACROSS AN OLD GENTLEMAN
HAD BECOME QUITE AN INSTITUTION IN LONDON SHE HAD OBTAINED FULL THOUGH BY NO MEANS UNDISPUTED POSSESSION OF THE GREAT HALL IN THE MARYLEBONE ROAD AND WAS UNDOUBTEDLY FOR THE MOMENT
THE BARONESS BELIEVED THAT ENORMOUS SUMS HAD BEEN RECEIVED AND WAS LOUD IN ASSURING ALL HER FRIENDS THAT THIS POPULARITY HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE BEEN PRODUCED BY HER OWN EXERTIONS
AT ANY RATE SHE WAS RESOLVED TO SEEK REDRESS AT LAW AND AT LAST HAD BEEN ADVISED TO PROCEED CONJOINTLY AGAINST AUNT JU LADY SELINA PROTEST AND THE BALD HEADED OLD GENTLEMAN
IT IS MY WILL SAID GLASTONBURY HANDING IT TO SIR RATCLIFFE WHO LAID IT DOWN ON THE TABLE NAY
AND ABSOLUTELY DID WORK HER WAY INTO THE CHAMBERS OF THAT DISCREET JUNIOR MISTER STUFFENRUFF SHE WAS FULL OF HER CASE FULL OF HER COMING TRIUMPH SHE WOULD TEACH WOMEN LIKE MISS JULIA MILDMAY
GLASTONBURY AND HERE SIR RATCLIFFE BECAME MORE ANIMATED YOU COULD NOT PERMIT IT MY HONOUR IS SAFE IN YOUR HANDS SIR RATCLIFFE PAUSED FOR A REPLY ON THAT SCORE MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR REPLIED GLASTONBURY
TO PERUSE IT FOR IT CONCERNS YOURSELF I WOULD RATHER LEARN ITS CONTENTS FROM YOURSELF IF YOU POSITIVELY DESIRE ME REPLIED SIR RATCLIFFE I HAVE LEFT EVERYTHING TO OUR CHILD SAID GLASTONBURY FOR THUS
OH GEORGE ARE WE TO HAVE THAT ALL AGAIN WHY SHOULDN'T SHE HAVE GONE ASKED THE DEAN ARE YOU IN FAVOUR OF RIGHTS OF WOMEN NOT PARTICULARLY
GLASTONBURY I CANNOT INDEED MISTER GLASTONBURY LOOKED AT SIR RATCLIFFE STEADILY THEN RISING FROM HIS SEAT HE TOOK THE BARONET'S ARM AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE GATES OF THE CASTLE WHERE HE LODGED
AND WAS VERY KEEN IN THINKING WHAT STEPS HAD BETTER BE TAKEN MARY WISHED TO RUN OFF TO THE DEANERY AT ONCE
HAD FOR THE MOMENT BEEN THE SPOKESWOMAN AND IN THESE OVERTURES IT HAD BEEN INTIMATED TO HER THAT THE DIRECTORS WOULD BE HAPPY TO REMUNERATE HER FOR HER TROUBLE SHOULD THE MONEY COLLECTED AT THE HALL ENABLE THEM TO DO SO
CLEARING HIS THROAT AND FILLING HIS GLASS AT THE SAME TIME THAT SIR RATCLIFFE SAID TO HIS REMAINING GUEST MY DEAR GLASTONBURY YOU CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE DAYS OF MAGIC HAVE RETURNED
IT IS THEN IT MUST BE THEN AS I SUSPECT REJOINED SIR RATCLIFFE I AM YOUR DEBTOR FOR THIS GREAT SERVICE IT IS EASY TO COUNT YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO ME SAID GLASTONBURY
AND HAD NOW DONE HIS WORK LOOKED AT IN ANY LIGHT THE THING WAS VERY TERRIBLE LORD GEORGE MIGHT PROBABLY EVEN YET BE ABLE TO RUN AWAY WITH HER TO SOME OBSCURE CORNER OF THE CONTINENT
SAID SIR RATCLIFFE THROWING HIMSELF BACK IN THE CHAIR AND COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND I KNOW NOT WHAT TO SAY I KNOW NOT WHAT TO FEEL GLASTONBURY ADVANCED AND GENTLY TOOK HIS OTHER HAND
UPON THIS SLIGHT SERVICE AY THAT THE OFFERING MIGHT BE MADE IN THE SPIRIT OF MOST RESPECTFUL AFFECTION AND NOT ALTOGETHER BE DEVOID OF FAVOUR IN YOUR SIGHT EXCELLENT KIND HEARTED MAN SAID SIR RATCLIFFE
IT WAS SHE SAID VERY CRUEL AND SHE DID HOPE THAT GEORGE WOULD COME TO HER AT ONCE IF HE DIDN'T COME SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD DIE NOTHING OF COURSE WAS SAID TO THE MARCHIONESS
RAISED A LITTLE MONEY FROM THOSE WHO WERE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO COME IN HER WAY BUT SHE WAS SENSIBLE OF HER OWN DEGRADATION AND AT THE SAME TIME QUITE ASSURED THAT AS A PREACHER
THE BUSINESS HAD NOW BEEN BROUGHT INTO PROPER FORM AND THE TRIAL WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN MARCH ALL THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF MUCH TROUBLE TO POOR MARY AND OF VERY GREAT VEXATION TO LORD GEORGE
EVERYWHERE HOW SHE DID WORK THE ATTORNIES WHO HAD THE CASE IN HANDS FOUND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO SECURE THEMSELVES AGAINST HER SHE INSISTED ON SEEING THE BARRISTERS
MARY WHEN SHE SAW THIS AND THE PAPER DID NOT REACH HER TILL SHE WAS AT MANOR CROSS WAS VIOLENT IN HER ANXIETY TO WRITE HERSELF IN HER OWN NAME AND DISCLAIM ALL DISABILITIES
IT WAS ARRANGED THAT FERDINAND SHOULD JOIN HIS REGIMENT BY THE NEXT MEDITERRANEAN PACKET WHICH WAS NOT TO QUIT FALMOUTH FOR A FORTNIGHT GLASTONBURY AND HIMSELF THEREFORE LOST NO TIME
THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE NAME OF ARMINE
WHEN THE FEUD WAS FIRST BECOMING FURIOUS AN ENORMOUS ADVERTISEMENT WAS ISSUED BY DOCTOR FLEABODY'S FRIENDS IN WHICH HER CAUSE WAS ADVOCATED AND HER CLAIMS RECAPITULATED
AND HE WILL MAKE IT STRAIGHT FOR US YOU NEED NOT TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT IT AT ALL THOSE WOMEN AT MANOR CROSS ARE OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER LORD GEORGE CAME AND WAS VERY ANGRY
MISSUS TOFF REMEMBERING THAT A BROTHER OF HERS WHO HAD FORGOTTEN HIMSELF IN LIQUOR AT THE BROTHERTON ASSIZES
AND INTENDED TO BEAR ALL THE EXPENSES OF THE TRIAL IT WAS AFTER THE GENERAL INTIMATION WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO THE WORLD IN THIS MATTER THAT THE SUMMONS FOR LADY MARY HAD BEEN SENT DOWN TO MANOR CROSS
THAT JOURNEY WHICH WAS TO BE MADE FOR SO IMPORTANT AN OBJECT THEN LORD GEORGE DID JUST WHAT HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DONE HE WROTE AN ANGRY LETTER TO MISS FLEABODY AS HE CALLED HER COMPLAINING BITTERLY
THE BARONESS WHEN SHE DESIRED TO BE LITTLE THE DOCTOR ALWAYS CALLED HER A FEMALE AND THE BARONESS THOUGH IN TRUTH SHE WAS NOT PERSONALLY ATTRACTIVE DID CONTRIVE TO SURROUND HERSELF WITH SUPPORTERS
AND IMPLYING THAT THEREBY ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WAS SUPPLIED THAT THE DISABILITIES OF WOMEN WERE ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING TO THE SEX IN ENGLAND
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DEAR TO THE BARONESS BUT THE AMERICAN DOCTOR WAS MAKING A RAPID FORTUNE OUT OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE HALL
WHO IN THE MIDST OF HER WRATH AND ZEAL AND LABOUR WAS SUPERIOR TO ALL JOKES TWO DAYS BEFORE THAT FIXED FOR THE TRIAL THERE FELL A GREAT BLOW UPON THOSE WHO WERE INTERESTED IN THE MATTER
DESTINED FOR OUR FERDINAND YET A LITTLE TIME AND ADRIAN GLASTONBURY MUST BE GATHERED TO HIS FATHERS WHY THEN DEPRIVE HIM OF THE GREATEST GRATIFICATION OF HIS REMAINING YEARS THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT
IN WHICH MESSENGERS FROM THE QUEEN'S JUDGES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIND HER AND SHE MIGHT PERHAPS BEAR THE JOURNEY WITHOUT INJURY BUT THEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF A BABY PERHAPS OF A POPENJOY SO BORN
AND MISSUS MONTACUTE JONES AND THE WHOLE EXPENSE ACCORDING TO AUNT JU WOULD FALL UPON HER FOR IT SEEMED TO BE THE OPINION OF THE LAWYERS THAT SHE HAD HIRED THE BARONESS
DEAR SIR RATCLIFFE HE OBSERVED IN HIS USUAL CALM SWEET VOICE
VARIOUS LETTERS WRITTEN TO LORD GEORGE LADY SARAH WROTE VERY SENSIBLY SUGGESTING THAT HE SHOULD GO TO MISTER STOKES THE FAMILY LAWYER
THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR ORDERS FROM THE LADY AND MUST LOOK TO THE LADY FOR PAYMENT THEY WHO BEST KNEW MISTER PHILOGUNAC COELEBS THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ESCAPED CHEAPLY
AND HOLD MYSELF BUT THE STEWARD OF HIS INHERITANCE WHICH I WILL NEVER ABUSE O GLASTONBURY NO MORE OF THIS I PRAY YOU HAVE WASTED A PRECIOUS LIFE UPON OUR FORLORN RACE ALAS HOW OFTEN AND HOW KEENLY DO I FEEL
AND LADY SELINA PROTEST
HE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT A RATHER FREE LIVING SELF INDULGENT SORT OF CHAP
QUICK TO EXCUSE HE SUGGESTED YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY HEARD
PARDON ME CRIED SIR CHARLES PROMPTLY INTERPOSING AND UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION AT A GLANCE
WENT ON THE ATTACHE I SHALL GO TO THE CLUB FIRST GET A ROOM DRESS AND ALL THAT THEN CALL AT THE HOTEL MADAGASCAR THERE IS A LADY THERE ONE OF OUR PARTY IN FACT AND I SHOULD LIKE TO ASK AFTER HER SHE MAY BE GLAD OF MY SERVICES
BUT WITH TEARS IN HER SADDENED EYES HE WAS A VERY STERN OLD MAN
A RIVAL GRECIAN STATE AND THAT THREE HUNDRED MEN HAD SAVED THEIR LIVES IN FLIGHT THE NEWS WAS BROUGHT AT THE MOMENT WHEN SOME GREAT FESTIVAL WAS BEING CELEBRATED IN THE CITY
SHOULD SECRETLY REPAY ME THE AMOUNT OF MY DEPOSIT ALL THE MONEY I HAD IN IT TO JOIN ME IN HIS FRAUD IN FACT THE SCOUNDREL UPON MY WORD HE HAS BEEN WELL SERVED AND THAT WAS THE LAST YOU SAW OF HIM I SAW HIM ON THE JOURNEY
OF COURSE WE KNOW BETTER THAN THAT NOW WHY NOW HAVEN'T YOU HEARD IT WAS IN THE FIGARO YESTERDAY AND IN ALL THE PARIS PAPERS QUADLING'S BANK HAS GONE TO SMASH HE HAS BOLTED WITH ALL THE READY HE COULD LAY HANDS UPON HE DIDN'T GET FAR THEN
SHE LAID HER HAND GENTLY ON HIS ARM AND HIS CLOSED OVER IT WITH SUCH EVIDENT GOOD WILL THAT A BLUSH CRIMSONED HER CHEEK IT STILL HUNG THERE AND DEEPENED WHEN HE SAID WARMLY AS IF ANYTHING COULD MAKE ME DO THAT DON'T YOU KNOW
AND YET WHAT AFTER ALL DID IT MATTER TO HIM A GOOD DEAL REALLY MORE THAN HE CHOSE TO ADMIT TO HIMSELF EVEN NOW WHEN CLOSELY QUESTIONING HIS SECRET HEART THE FACT WAS THE COUNTESS HAD MADE A VERY STRONG IMPRESSION ON HIM FROM THE FIRST
AND DID SHE ENCOURAGE HIM LORD HOW CAN I TELL WHO SHALL SAY HOW A WOMAN'S FANCY FALLS IT MIGHT HAVE SUITED HER TOO
THEN AT THE VISITOR AS HE STOOD THERE WAITING RATHER IMPATIENTLY THEN AGAIN AT THE CARD AT LAST HE WALKED OUT AND ACROSS THE INNER COURTYARD OF THE HOTEL TO THE OFFICE PRESENTLY THE MANAGER CAME BACK BOWING LOW AND HOLDING THE CARD IN HIS HAND
FULL OF THESE THOUGHTS AND HAUNTED BY PHIDON'S UNYIELDING SEVERITY SHE HAD A STRANGE DREAM ONE NIGHT SHE DREAMED THAT KING AGESILAUS WAS WILLING TO PARDON ALL THOSE THREE HUNDRED SOLDIERS WHO HAD FLED FROM THE FIELD OF LEUCTRA
I SAW EUCRATES FIGHTING IN THE THICKEST OF THE FRAY I SAW HIM FALL AND THERE FELL ANOTHER BY HIS SIDE FIGHTING AS GALLANTLY AS HE HIS COMRADE IN DEATH AS WELL AS IN LIFE AND WHO WAS IT THAT DIED WITH MY BRAVE SON
OR KEEP THEM FROM YOU NO NO NO INDEED NOT NOW SHE LOOKED UP APPEALINGLY THE TEARS BRIMMING UP IN HER BRIGHT EYES I CANNOT WILL NOT ACCEPT THIS SACRIFICE
I WISHED SHE HAD GONE OUT MORE THERE WERE LOTS OF MEN READY TO FALL AT HER FEET YOU WERE IN ROME THEN SOME TIME BACK DID YOU EVER COME ACROSS A MAN THERE QUADLING THE BANKER OF COURSE I DID CONSTANTLY
FREELY WITH WHOLE HEART AND SOUL CREPT UP UNDER HIS SHELTERING WING LIKE A STORM BEATEN DOVE REENTERING THE NEST AND THERE COOING SOFTLY MY KNIGHT MY OWN TRUE KNIGHT AND LORD YIELDED HERSELF WILLINGLY AND UNQUESTIONINGLY TO HIS TENDER CARESSES
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY GLORY AS SOON AS NEWS HAD COME OF THE DEFEAT OF THE SPARTAN ARMY THE WHOLE REMAINING MILITARY FORCE OF SPARTA WAS SENT TO THE RESCUE AND AFTER SOME TIME RETURNED TO SPARTA BRINGING BACK THE SURVIVORS FROM THE DISASTROUS FIELD OF LEUCTRA
INTERRUPTED THE GENERAL HASTILY AND SOMEWHAT UNEASILY TO BE SURE THE MAN TOLD ME OF IT HIMSELF
PHIDON HAS HEARD THE NEWS HE SAID AND HE THANKS THE GODS FOR THIS CROWNING MERCY
CRIED SIR CHARLES YOU LOOK SURPRISED JACK DIDN'T THEY TELL YOU THIS QUADLING WAS THE MAN MURDERED IN THE SLEEPING CAR IT WAS NO DOUBT FOR THE MONEY HE CARRIED WITH HIM WAS IT QUADLING MY WORD WHAT A TERRIBLE NEMESIS WELL
HALF GRIEF HALF DREAD I CANNOT TELL YOU I AM OBLIGED TO I I THEN DO NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD HE SAID PROMPTLY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS BUT MY LIPS ARE SEALED AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT YOU DO NOT WILL NOT THINK ANY WORSE OF ME
WHO DO THEY THINK IT IS A MISTER QUADLING A BANKER WHO IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ABSCONDED FROM ROME SHE RECEIVED THE NEWS SO IMPASSIVELY WITH SUCH STRANGE SELF POSSESSION THAT FOR A MOMENT HE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HER BUT THEN
EVERY VILLAIN GETS HIS DESERTS IN THE LONG RUN SHE SAID WITH BITTER SENTENTIOUSNESS AND THIS MISTER QUADLING IS BUT WAIT YOU SHALL KNOW HIM BETTER HE CAME TO ME TO PROPOSE WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT HE HIS BANK I MEAN
ENDORSED NOW BY HIS FRIEND PAPILLON CLEARLY SHE HAD KEPT UP HER ACQUAINTANCE HER INTIMACY TO THE VERY LAST WHY OTHERWISE SHOULD SHE HAVE RECEIVED HIM ALONE BEEN CLOSETED WITH HIM FOR AN HOUR OR MORE ON THE VERY EVE OF HIS FLIGHT
AND IT WAS IN VAIN THAT IONE PLEADED FOR THE FRIEND OF EUCRATES
THE ANSWER CAME AT ONCE AND UNHESITATINGLY AS IT WOULD TO ANY OTHER HONEST CHIVALROUS GENTLEMAN BY GEORGE I'LL STICK TO HER THROUGH THICK AND THIN I'LL TRUST HER WHATEVER HAPPENS OR HAS HAPPENED COME WHAT MAY
IONE HE SAID NOT ONE SINGLE TEAR SHOULD COURSE DOWN YOUR CHEEKS NOT ONE SINGLE PANG OF GRIEF SHOULD ASSAIL YOUR HEART I IT IS WHO SHOULD WEEP I IT IS WHO SHOULD MOURN
HE LIVES AND BY LIVING HE HAS BROUGHT DISHONOUR AND SHAME ON HIS FAMILY HOW CAN I MEET HIM WHAT CAN I SAY TO HIM NAY I WILL NOT LOOK UPON HIS FACE I WILL NOT VOUCHSAFE ONE WORD OF GREETING TO HIM
BUT YOU KNEW HIM CERTAINLY THEY WERE MY BANKERS MUCH TO MY SORROW
ONLY NOW WHEN HE HAD SHARED A SERIOUS TROUBLE WITH HER HAD PASSED THROUGH COMMON DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS HE WAS FINDING WHAT ACCIDENT MAY DO HOW IT MAY FAN A FIRST LIKING INTO A STRONGER FLAME
AND TRULY HER DREAM WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF DIVINATION FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS A DECREE WAS PROPOSED BY THE KING AND PASSED IN THE ASSEMBLY TO THE EFFECT THAT ALL THOSE WHO HAD FLED FROM THE FIELD OF LEUCTRA WERE TO BE PARDONED AND RECEIVED HOME WITHOUT DISHONOUR ORDINARILY
THE MANAGER NOW RETURNED AND ADMITTED THAT MADAME LA COMTESSE WOULD RECEIVE HER VISITOR A FEW SECONDS MORE AND THE GENERAL WAS ADMITTED INTO HER PRESENCE HOW TRULY KIND OF YOU TO CALL
I WILL WAIT TILL SHE DOES THUS FORTIFIED AND DECIDED SIR CHARLES TOOK HIS WAY TO THE HOTEL MADAGASCAR ABOUT NOON AT THE DESK HE INQUIRED FOR THE COUNTESS AND BEGGED THAT HIS CARD MIGHT BE SENT UP TO HER THE MAN LOOKED AT IT
STAND BACK AND SEEING THE DETECTIVE HESITATE HE ADDED PEREMPTORILY
AND WOULD HEAR NO WORD OF COMFORT THOUGH AS THE DAYS WENT BY IT SEEMED TO EASE HIS STERN SPIRIT TO SIT BESIDE HER AND WATCH HER AT HER WORK
BUT THAT PHIDON INTERPOSED AND STANDING IN THE PUBLIC ASSEMBLY GAVE HIS VOTE AGAINST THE PARDON
SHE SAID AT ONCE COMING UP TO HIM WITH BOTH HANDS OUTSTRETCHED AND FRANK GLADNESS IN HER EYES YES SHE WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE IN HER PLAIN DARK TRAVELLING DRESS DRAPING HER TALL GRACEFUL FIGURE HER BEAUTIFUL PALE FACE WAS ENHANCED BY THE RICH TONES OF HER DARK BROWN WAVY HAIR
IT MAY SURPRISE YOU SHOCK YOU TO HEAR I THINK YOU KNEW HIM NOTHING CAN WELL SHOCK ME NOW
SHE MURMURED QUITE SOFTLY AND LOOKING UP FOR THE FIRST TIME SHYLY TO MEET HIS EYES HER HAND WAS STILL ON HIS ARM COVERED BY HIS AND SHE NESTLED SO CLOSE TO HIM THAT IT WAS EASY NATURAL INDEED
THE REVEREND SILAS AND THE MILITARY ATTACHE COLONEL PAPILLON THEY PAUSED FOR A MOMENT OUTSIDE THE STATION WHILE THE BAGGAGE WAS BEING GOT TOGETHER
HE HAD ADMIRED HER GREATLY DURING THE PAST WINTER AT ROME BUT THEN IT WAS ONLY A PASSING FANCY AS HE THOUGHT
WE SAW THAT OUR FRIEND WAS A DIPLOMAT QUICKLY MISTER ELLIOTT GAVE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE NEGRO'S CONFESSION AND THE DETECTIVE SAID
IT MUST BE IMPRESSED UPON HIM THAT HE IS REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF A HERO APPEAL TO THE INNATE WEAKNESS OF THE RACE DESIRE FOR FLATTERY
WERE IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS
AT THE STAKE OAKES SAID MOORE WITH A SMILE YOU SEEM TO MAKE MENTAL PROCESSES AND CONDITIONS
TO THEORIZE TOO MUCH WAS VERY EASY BUT SOMETIMES FATAL TO DETECTION OF CRIME HE PREFERRED TO WORK ALONG SEVERAL LINES OF INVESTIGATION BEFORE CONCENTRATION ON ANY ONE IDEA
YES SAID HALLEN AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS ONLY ONE QUINTUS OAKES IT SEEMS TO ME CONTINUED HALLEN
I SHALL MAKE TIME HALLEN TO DO WHAT LITTLE I CAN AND THUS QUINTUS OAKES BECAME THE LEADER IN THE UNRAVELLING OF THE MARK MURDER MYSTERY AFTER A FEW REMARKS OF NO PARTICULAR CONSEQUENCE
OF THE CRIMINAL'S REASONING A MOTIVE BUILT UP OF SOMETHING UNREAL A DELUSION IN THE MIND OF ONE NOT IN HIS RIGHT SENSES
BECAUSE HE MUST HAVE RIDDEN HIS CAMEL FROM THE ROADWAY RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE GRASS THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED THEN HE MUST HAVE
SOMEBODY HAD QUIETLY STOLEN HIS PURSE AND GONE AWAY THE TRAVELER RAN TO THE NEAREST VILLAGE AND THERE TOLD THE POLICE ABOUT IT NOW AMONG THE POLICE THERE WAS A VERY CLEVER MAN
UNDOUBTEDLY AND HE RAN TO ESCAPE DETECTION HIMSELF THE OTHER
ONCE UPON A TIME A TRAVELER WAS GOING ON FOOT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN HIS BELT HE HAD A PURSE FULL OF MONEY ONE DAY AS THE SUN BEGAN TO GET HOT HE LAY DOWN ON THE GRASS UNDER A TREE NEAR THE ROADWAY AND FELL ASLEEP
JUMPED DOWN UPON THE GRASS WHERE HE KNEW HE WOULD NOT LEAVE ANY FOOTPRINT HE MUST HAVE WALKED VERY QUIETLY ON THE GRASS UP TO THE TREE WHERE THE TRAVELER WAS SLEEPING AND STOLEN THE MONEY
LOOK AT HISTORY AND CONSIDER THE WAVES OF RELIGION EMOTIONAL IN CHARACTER THAT HAVE OCCURRED LOOK AT THE UNREASONABLENESS DEVELOPED IN OUR OWN COUNTRY FROM IGNORANCE AND FEAR
AND THE POLICE BROUGHT HIM WITH THEM TO THE PLACE WHERE THE MONEY HAD BEEN STOLEN THE CLEVER MAN LOOKED ALL AROUND THE PLACE VERY CAREFULLY TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND ANY MARKS ON THE GROUND
NEARLY EVERY STEP HE TOOK JERKED THE LOAD ON HIS BACK
AND A FEW GRAINS OF THE CORN FELL TO THE GROUND FROM THE PACKAGE ON HIS LEFT SIDE BUT YOU COULD NOT SEE VERY WELL HERE AND THERE ON THE GROUND JUST A FEW DROPS OF HONEY OR
IN HIS LEFT HIND FOOT
THE TENSION IS GREAT TOO GREAT FOR SAFETY
AND A MORE OR LESS GENERAL CONVERSATION HE RESUMED SUPPOSE CHIEF THAT WE NOW SMUGGLE THE NEGRO INTO MONA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BRING HIM HERE I BELIEVE THAT IF MISTER ELLIOTT GOES BACK WITH MARTIN
I COULD NOT THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED
AS ANY CARPENTER OR MASON MIGHT DO LOOKS AS THOUGH I AM GOING TO HOLD A RECEPTION THIS MORNING SAID OAKES
AFTER A FEW HOURS HE WOKE UP AND WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND THAT THE PURSE WAS GONE
ONE MUST ALWAYS TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE ACTIONS AND REASONINGS OF COMMUNITIES EMOTIONAL WAVES RUSH THROUGH THEM AS THROUGH INDIVIDUALS SOMETIMES
THAT SHOWED THAT THE CAMEL WAS LIMPING AND THE LEFT HIND FOOT ONLY JUST TOUCHED THE GROUND SO I KNEW THAT HE WAS LAME IN THAT FOOT THAT IS ALSO VERY CLEVER OF YOU THE JUDGE SAID
THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED BUT I CAN TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THE CAMEL THE CAMEL IS BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE AND LAME IN HIS LEFT HIND FOOT
THE CLEVER MAN ANSWERED VERY MODESTLY FIRST ABOUT THE CAMEL BEING BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE HE HAD NIBBLED AT THE SHRUBS AND BUSHES GROWING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD
BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAN RIDING A CAMEL BLIND IN HIS RIGHT EYE LAME IN LEFT HIND FOOT AND CARRYING HONEY ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND CORN ON THE LEFT SIDE SO THE POLICE KNEW THAT HE WAS THE THIEF
I VENTURED OR BOTH SAID OAKES AT ALL EVENTS SAID HALLEN
GOOD SAID OAKES NOW MISTER ELLIOTT WILL YOU KINDLY RETIRE WITH DOCTOR MOORE WHILE STONE MARTIN AND I HEAR WHAT THE CHIEF HAS TO SAY WHEN HALLEN CAME UP HE SEEMED VERY CORDIAL BUT WORRIED
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD I FOUND A SWARM OF BEES HERE AND THERE SO I KNEW THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO PICK UP THE HONEY AND ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD I SAW A WHOLE LOT OF ANTS HERE AND THERE
ON THE GRASS NEAR THE TREE HE FOUND NO MARKS IN FACT IF A PERSON WALKS ON THE GRASS JUST ONCE OR TWICE IT DOES NOT LEAVE ANY MARK
AND I TRUST THAT YOU WILL FIND TIME TO CONSIDER THE MURDER ALSO GENTLEMEN SAID OAKES VERY SERIOUSLY
AS THE MATTER BELONGS TO HIS JURISDICTION LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THAT MOMENT
BUT NOW AND AGAIN HE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE SHRUBS AND BUSHES WHICH GREW HERE AND THERE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD HELLO THAT IS STRANGE HE SUDDENLY SAID
THEY MIGHT INFER HE WAS THE MURDERER AND VIOLENCE WOULD CERTAINLY BE DONE HIM AT PRESENT I HAVE ALL I CAN DO TO KEEP ORDER IN THE TOWN SAID HALLEN THEN HE GAVE A LUCID ACCOUNT OF THE WAVE OF SUSPICION AND OF THE EVIDENCES
YOU SEE THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROBABLE CONDITION OF SUCH A ONE'S MIND IS OFTEN PARAMOUNT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH A CASE AS THIS IN OTHER WORDS WAS THE MOTIVE
AFTER FOLLOWING THE CAMEL'S FOOTPRINTS ON THE GROUND FOR A LONG TIME THE POLICE AT LAST CAME TO A VILLAGE THEY SEARCHED THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND FOUND MANY MEN RIDING CAMELS
OAKES DID NOT NOTICE THE REMARK BUT SAID
THAT THE FIRST ONE WARNED YOU AND WAS IN A SENSE A FRIEND IS MYSTERIOUS ENOUGH IT NEEDS SOLUTION BUT THAT THE MAN WHO WARNED YOU SHOULD HAVE RUN AWAY AND BEEN PURSUED BY THE OTHER IS PECULIAR TO SAY THE LEAST
THAT WAS THE SIMPLEST OF ALL
MIGHT BE CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER INDIRECTLY OR DIRECTLY BUT AS YET WE HAD NOT HAD SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDYING THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE HOUSE OR THE LIFE OF ITS ATTACHES TO VENTURE AN OPINION
I BELIEVE WE CAN BRING HIM HERE EASILY SAID ELLIOTT FOR HE HAS CONFIDENCE IN ME IF HE REFUSES TO COME SAID HALLEN WE CAN GET HIM HERE IN PLENTY OF WAYS YES SAID OAKES
WAIT TILL YOU GET TO THE BUSH SAID HIS UNCLE
FERGUS INQUIRED EVERY FLOCK HAD ITS SHEPHERD WHO LED IT WHEREVER FOOD AND WATER WERE TO BE FOUND WAS THE ANSWER THE LIFE OF A SHEPHERD WAS A LONELY ONE HE HAD TO WATCH THE SHEEP AND LAMBS
THERE WAS A SCRAMBLE AND A CRY BOTH BOYS LOST THEIR BALANCE AND FELL AND THE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS CRASHED THROUGH THE AIR BOTH MOTHERS RUSHED TO THE SCENE TO FIND TWO PAIRS OF ARMS AND LEGS
NOW IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL WORLD AND THE GOOD BIRDS SANG HAPPILY AND REJOICED IN THE WORK WHICH THEY HAD HELPED AND IN THE SPARKLING WATER WHICH WAS SWEET TO THEIR TASTE ALL WERE HAPPY
WHICH SLOPES DOWN TO THE PLAINS OF CENTRAL AUSTRALIA THIS CENTRAL PORTION IS AN ALMOST UNKNOWN COUNTRY THERE ARE NO GREAT RIVERS AND LITTLE RAIN THE LAND IS TERRIBLY DRY AND VERY HOT
THE CURIOUS BOOK OF BIRDS
WHILE EVERY ONE ELSE EVEN THE TINIEST LITTLE HUMMING BIRD OF ALL HAD TWO THE NIGHTINGALE FELT VERY SORE ABOUT THIS MATTER AND TRIED TO CONCEAL HER MISFORTUNE FROM THE OTHER BIRDS
SO I RAN UP BEHIND HIM JUST AS HE SWUNG HIS STICK OVER HIS SHOULDER TO HIT THE SNAKE HE HIT ME IN THE MOUTH BUT OF COURSE HE DIDN'T MEAN TO MOTHER I SCREAMED BECAUSE IT HURT ME SO AND THEN I TRIED NOT TO CRY BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD WORRY YOU
I WAS AFRAID OF SPOILING MY PRETTY BRIGHT COAT AND MY SILVER SHINING HOSE OH VAIN AND LAZY BIRD SAID THE LORD SADLY HAVE YOU NOTHING TO DO BUT SHOW OFF YOUR FINE CLOTHES AND GIVE YOURSELF AIRS
BUT HOW CAN I GO IF I DO THE OTHER BIRDS WILL DISCOVER THAT I HAVE BUT ONE EYE AND THEN HOW THE DISAGREEABLE CREATURES WILL LAUGH AT ME OH DEAR OH DEAR WHAT SHALL I DO I CANNOT GO NO
SHADED IN VINES AND LOOKING ON A GARDEN IN WHICH GORGEOUS HUED FLOWERS BLOOMED IN BRILLIANT BEAUTY THERE WAS AN AIR OF GREAT COMFORT ABOUT THE PLACE HAMMOCKS WERE SLUNG IN THE PORCHES AND EASY CHAIRS WERE PLACED INVITINGLY ABOUT
THEN HE DISAPPEARED INTO A TINY OPENING FOR THOUGH THE BLINDWORM IS NEARLY A FOOT LONG HE IS SO SMOOTH AND SLIPPERY THAT HE CAN ENTER A HOLE WHICH IS ALMOST SMALLER THAN HIMSELF
NAY NAY WARBLED THE NIGHTINGALE AS SHE FLEW AWAY TO MAKE HERSELF FINE FOR THE WEDDING I SHALL SING SING SING NIGHT AND DAY HENCEFORTH TO KEEP MYSELF AWAKE AND THUS I NEED NOT FEAR FAREWELL WELL WELL
LAUGHED MISTER MC DONALD YES AND NO YOU SEE THE AUSTRALIANS WHO LIVE IN THE CITIES CONSIDER ALL THE REST OF THE CONTINENT THE BUSH BUT TO THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE GRAZING AND FARMING DISTRICTS
WE SEE THAT SHE IS CREEPING CLIMBING LOOKING UP EAGERLY TOWARD THE SKY LONGING FOR THE RAIN TO FALL INTO HER THIRSTY BEAK SHE IS ALWAYS HOPING FOR THE STORM TO COME
BUT NOT FROM LAZINESS HAVE YOU NOT WORKED WITH YOUR BROTHERS AS I COMMANDED YOU IT WAS SUCH VERY DIRTY WORK PIPED THE WOODPECKER CROSSLY
AND BRIDGED COOL MOUNTAIN STREAMS WHEN THEIR STOPPING PLACE WAS REACHED AND THEY ALIGHTED FROM THE TRAIN TO FIND A COMFORTABLE CART AND GOOD HORSES AWAITING THEM FERGUS EXCLAIMED
A WINDMILL CARRIED WATER FROM THIS TO A PLATFORM AND UPON THIS WERE IRON TANKS FROM WHICH PIPES CARRIED WATER THROUGH THE HOUSE THE BOYS HAD DECIDED TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE RESERVOIR AND SLIDE DOWN THE PIPES
AND WEAR IT TO JENNY WREN'S WEDDING THEN NO ONE WILL EVER DISCOVER MY MISFORTUNE NOW THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT SCHEME
THEN YOU WILL BE BLIND WHOLLY BLIND AS I AM NOW AT THESE THREATENING WORDS THE NIGHTINGALE CEASED TO SING
NOR WERE THERE ANY HOLLOWS OR VALLEYS TO HOLD THE SEAS AND RIVERS FOUNTAINS AND POOLS WHICH THE WORLD OF MEN WOULD NEED IT MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN A STUPID AND UGLY EARTH IN THOSE DAYS WITH NO CHANCE FOR SWIMMING OR SAILING
BESIDES IT MADE HER ANGRY TO THINK THAT HE KNEW HER SECRET AND TALKED ALOUD ABOUT IT
BUT THE POOR NIGHTINGALE WAS SET IN A FLUTTER OF ANXIETY BY THE NEWS
SANDY SAID IT WAS A SNAKE AND BEAT THE BUSHES TO DRIVE HIM OUT IT RAN OUT JUST IN FRONT OF FERGUS AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BITE HIM AND I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO MY BROTHER
THAN SHE HAD EVER SUNG BEFORE AND AFTER THAT ALTHOUGH SHE WAS WEARY OH SO WEARY SHE SANG ALL NIGHT LONG
WAVING WILDLY FROM THE HOT BED WHILE BROKEN GLASS WAS SCATTERED HITHER AND YON
SISTER NIGHTINGALE THEY SAY MAY NOT REST BUT STILL SOUNDS THE NOTES OF HER BEAUTIFUL SONG IN GROVE AND THICKET WHY DOES SHE SING THUS ALL NIGHT LONG AS WELL AS THROUGH THE DAY
BUT TO THE WOODPECKER HE SAID AS FOR YOU O WOODPECKER I OBSERVE THAT YOUR FEATHERS ARE UNRUFFLED BY WORK AND THAT THERE IS NO SPOT OF SOIL UPON YOUR BEAK AND CLAWS HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO KEEP SO NEAT
AND SO THE NIGHTINGALE WENT TO THE WEDDING
SAID JEAN'S MOTHER IT HAS BEEN SOME TIME SINCE WE HEARD A SHRIEK OF ANY KIND OH WHAT IS THAT FOR AS SHE SPOKE THERE CAME A SCREAM SO LOUD AND PIERCING FROM THE SHRUBBERY
THEY COULD PERHAPS BUY A SMALL HOMESTEAD AND STOCK IT BUT LITTLE MORE THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE LARGE TRACTS OF LAND TO PASTURE THEIR SHEEP BUT HAD NOT MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY THE LAND THEY THEREFORE SETTLED DOWN
LONG WINDOWS CLEAR TO THE FLOOR OPENED INTO THE LIVING ROOMS AND A WIDE HALLWAY RAN THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE ON ONE SIDE WAS A DRAWING ROOM AT THE OTHER DINING ROOM AND LIVING ROOM
BUT I HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY A STATION AND I CAN'T BE A SQUATTER NOW SAID MISTER HUME THEIR WAY LAY THROUGH A BEAUTIFUL SEMI TROPICAL COUNTRY THE TRAIN MOVED THROUGH FERTILE VALLEYS FINE WOODLAND AND GREEN VALES
THAN THE BOYS DECIDED THE TIME HAD COME FOR THEM TO CARRY OUT A PLAN LONG SINCE FORMED BUT LAID ASIDE FOR A CONVENIENT SEASON AT ONE SIDE OF THE RUN WAS A LITTLE LAKE FORMED WHERE ONE OF THE BOUNDARY STREAMS WAS DAMMED
WHO APPEARED AT THAT MOMENT FROM THE STABLES GO AND GET WASHED UP AND WE'LL SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY BROKEN GLASS IN YOUR CUTS WHEN THE DAMAGES WERE REPAIRED NEITHER BOY WAS FOUND TO BE MUCH HURT BUT JEAN BEGGED SO HARD THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED
THEN THERE WAS A TWITTERING AND FLUTTERING AS THE GOOD BIRDS SET TO WORK WITH A WILL SINGING HAPPILY OVER THE WORK WHICH THEIR DEAR LORD HAD GIVEN THEM TO DO
DISOBEDIENT WOODPECKER LONG LONG AGO AT THE BEGINNING OF THINGS THEY SAY THAT THE LORD MADE THE WORLD SMOOTH AND ROUND LIKE AN APPLE THERE WERE NO HILLS NOR MOUNTAINS
IT WAS THE BLINDWORM A SPOTTED GRAY STREAK WRITHING NOISELESSLY ALONG TOWARDS THE DECAYED WOOD OF A FALLEN TREE IN WHICH HE LOVED TO BURROW AND THE BLINDWORM WAS NOT SAD LIKE THE OTHERS
I THINK I SHALL KEEP JEAN ALWAYS IF HER BEING HERE KEEPS YOU OUT OF MISCHIEF SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AND SANDY ANSWERED WELL KEEP FERGUS TOO THEN NO SOONER WAS JEAN ASLEEP
THAT'S REAL AUSTRALIA FOR YOU I LIKE YOUR KIND BETTER SAID JEAN WITH A SHUDDER BUT FERGUS SAID BOASTINGLY WELL I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE BUSH WAIT AND SEE SAID HIS FATHER
ROWING OR FISHING BUT AS YET THERE WAS NO ONE TO THINK ANYTHING ABOUT IT NO ONE WHO WOULD LONG TO SWIM SAIL ROW AND FISH FOR THIS WAS LONG BEFORE MEN WERE CREATED
IN TIME THE MATTER WAS ARRANGED BY THE GOVERNMENT'S DIVIDING THE BACK COUNTRY INTO GRAZING DISTRICTS WHICH ALL THE SQUATTERS MIGHT USE BY PAYING A YEARLY RENT HOW DID THE SQUATTERS KEEP THEIR SHEEP FROM OTHER PEOPLE
SHE FLUTTERED INTO THE TOP OF THE OAK TREE AND FROM THERE HOPPED DOWN FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH FROM TWIG TO TWIG UNTIL SHE WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE SLEEPER'S UGLY HEAD OVER THE ONE CLOSED EYE THEN WHIRR
NOW WHEN THE WORLD WAS QUITE FINISHED AND THE BEAUTIFUL WATER SPARKLED AND GLINTED HERE AND THERE COOL AND REFRESHING THE LORD CALLED THE BIRDS TO HIM AND THANKED THEM FOR THEIR HELP PRAISING THEM FOR THEIR INDUSTRY AND ZEAL
THE GUESTS CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF BOOKS AND MUSIC AS THEY WERE USHERED INTO THEIR COOL BEDROOMS THESE OPENED ON TO THE VERANDA AND WERE COOL AND PLEASANT WITH GAY CHINTZ AND WHITE HANGINGS
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SO THAT IN AFTER TIME MEN SHALL LOVE THEM DEARLY COME MY BIRDS HE CRIED COME HITHER TO ME AND WITH THE BEAKS WHICH I HAVE GIVEN YOU HOLLOW ME OUT HERE AND HERE AND HERE
BASINS FOR THE LAKES AND POOLS WHICH I INTEND TO FILL WITH WATER FOR MEN AND FOR YOU THEIR FRIENDS COME LITTLE BROTHERS BUSY YOURSELVES AS YOU WOULD WISH TO BE HAPPY HEREAFTER
BEFORE AUSTRALIA HAD STARTED IN THE TRADE THE WOOL FROM THE SHEEP ON THE RUNS WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO HER SAID MISTER MC DONALD MEN WOULD COME OUT TO THE COUNTRY AND NOT HAVING VERY MUCH MONEY
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT SQUATTERS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ANSWERED FERGUS ONLY I HAVE HEARD THE NAME AND THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WOULD TELL US ABOUT THEM IN THE OLD TIMES
THEY PECKED AND THEY PECKED WITH THEIR SHARP LITTLE BILLS THEY SCRATCHED AND THEY SCRATCHED WITH THEIR SHARP LITTLE CLAWS TILL IN THE PROPER PLACES THEY HAD HOLLOWED OUT GREAT BASINS AND VALLEYS AND LONG RIVER BEDS AND LITTLE HOLES IN THE GROUND
GOOD DAY SISTER NIGHTINGALE HE SAID HOW IS YOUR EYE THIS MORNING WE HAVE A GOODLY PAIR BETWEEN US
DOWN SHE POUNCED UPON THE BLINDWORM AND BEFORE THE CREATURE HAD A CHANCE TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE NIGHTINGALE HAD STOLEN HIS EYE AND HAD POPPED IT INTO PLACE IN THE EMPTY SOCKET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER BEAK HA HA
THE DIVIDING RANGE IS THE HIGH LAND WHICH SEPARATES THE EAST AND WEST OF THE CONTINENT AND RUNS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ALONG THE COAST IT IS SOMETIMES CALLED THE AUSTRALIAN ALPS
PREENING HER PRETTY FEATHERS AND ADMIRING HER SILVER STOCKINGS YOU CAN TOIL IF YOU WANT TO SHE SAID TO THE OTHER BIRDS WHO WONDERED AT HER BUT I SHALL DO NO SUCH DIRTY WORK MY CLOTHES ARE TOO FINE
I HAVE WORKED HARD AND BEEN SUCCESSFUL WHEN YOU SEE OUR STATION I THINK YOU WILL WANT TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIND GOLD IN NEVER NEVER LAND HE SAID TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW PERHAPS I SHALL
AND TOOK WHAT THEY NEEDED WITHOUT PERMISSION AND SO WERE CALLED SQUATTERS THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT INTERFERE WITH THEM BECAUSE THE WOOL FROM THEIR SHEEP WAS NEEDED AND BECAUSE THE COUNTRY WAS SO BIG THERE SEEMED LAND ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE
FROM THE APPROACHING STORM IT WAS A SAD PUNISHMENT FOR THE WOODPECKER BUT SHE CERTAINLY DESERVED IT EVER SINCE THAT TIME WHENEVER WE HEAR A LITTLE TAP TAPPING IN THE TREE CITY
IN THOSE DAYS THE NIGHTINGALE ALSO HAD BUT ONE EYE AS FOR THE BLINDWORM IT MATTERED VERY LITTLE FOR HE WAS A HOMELY CREATURE CONTENT TO CRAWL ABOUT IN THE DARK UNDERGROUND
WHO IS WAITING TO CATCH HER WITH HER EYES CLOSED ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WORLD WAS VERY NEW THE BLINDWORM WAS NOT QUITE BLIND BUT HAD ONE GOOD EYE MOREOVER
AUSTRALIA IS MAKING THE GREATEST CHANGE IN JEAN SAID HER MOTHER TO MISSUS MC DONALD ONE DAY AS THEY SAT UPON THE VERANDA AT HOME SHE WAS SO SHY SHE WOULD SCARCELY LOOK AT ANY ONE SHE SEEMED DELICATE
