SHE TRIED TO EAT AS WELL TO SAVE HERSELF FROM THE PAIN OF BEING URGED AS TO MAKE HER FRIEND COMFORTABLE BUT SHE HAD NO APPETITE AND COULD NOT SWALLOW MANY MOUTHFULS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS AND HER LAST BREAKFAST IN THAT ROOM GAVE HER FRESH MISERY
I AM VERY SORRY IF I HAVE OFFENDED HIM IT WAS THE LAST THING I WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DONE BUT DO NOT BE UNHAPPY ELEANOR AN ENGAGEMENT YOU KNOW MUST BE KEPT I AM ONLY SORRY IT WAS NOT RECOLLECTED SOONER THAT I MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN HOME
MAY I CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR APPLICATION TO YOUR FAIR FRIEND I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO MAKE THE REQUEST SIR AS YOU CAME IN WELL PROCEED BY ALL MEANS I KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HEART IS IN IT
I CANNOT BEAR IT I COME TO YOU ON SUCH AN ERRAND ERRAND TO ME HOW SHALL I TELL YOU OH HOW SHALL I TELL YOU A NEW IDEA NOW DARTED INTO CATHERINE'S MIND
AND SHE ONLY WANTED TO KNOW HOW FAR AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED AN APOLOGY MIGHT PROPERLY BE RECEIVED BY HER BUT THE KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS HERE IT WAS NOT CALLED FOR
MY POOR HEAD I HAD QUITE FORGOT IT WELL THE THING IS THIS I HAVE JUST HAD A LETTER FROM JOHN YOU CAN GUESS THE CONTENTS NO INDEED I CANNOT MY SWEET LOVE
HEAVILY PASSED THE NIGHT SLEEP OR REPOSE THAT DESERVED THE NAME OF SLEEP WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT ROOM IN WHICH HER DISTURBED IMAGINATION HAD TORMENTED HER ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL
HIS DEPARTURE GAVE CATHERINE THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL CONVICTION THAT A LOSS MAY BE SOMETIMES A GAIN THE HAPPINESS WITH WHICH THEIR TIME NOW PASSED EVERY EMPLOYMENT VOLUNTARY EVERY LAUGH INDULGED
CATHERINE LINGERING ONLY HALF A MINUTE BEHIND HER FRIEND TO THROW A PARTING GLANCE ON EVERY WELL KNOWN CHERISHED OBJECT AND WENT DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHERE BREAKFAST WAS PREPARED
WHAT THIS ADDITIONAL FORTNIGHT
THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT SHOULD BE SO MEEKLY BORNE THE POWER OF EARLY HABIT ONLY COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT A DISTINCTION TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BORN GAVE NO PRIDE THEIR SUPERIORITY OF ABODE WAS NO MORE TO THEM THAN THEIR SUPERIORITY OF PERSON
CATHERINE'S SPIRITS HOWEVER WERE TRANQUILLIZED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
ELEANOR BROUGHT NO MESSAGE VERY LITTLE PASSED BETWEEN THEM ON MEETING
AND COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT IF MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND WERE AWARE OF THE PLEASURE IT WAS TO HER TO HAVE HER THERE THEY WOULD BE TOO GENEROUS TO HASTEN HER RETURN CATHERINE EXPLAINED OH AS TO THAT
AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PUMP ROOM ONE MORNING BY MISSUS ALLEN'S SIDE WITHOUT ANYTHING TO SAY OR TO HEAR AND SCARCELY HAD SHE FELT A FIVE MINUTES LONGING OF FRIENDSHIP BEFORE THE OBJECT OF IT APPEARED
AND THEN TILL I CAN ASK FOR YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AS I OUGHT TO DO I WILL NOT EXPECT MORE DIRECT TO ME AT LORD LONGTOWN'S AND I MUST ASK IT UNDER COVER TO ALICE NO ELEANOR
AT THAT MOMENT CATHERINE THOUGHT SHE HEARD HER STEP IN THE GALLERY AND LISTENED FOR ITS CONTINUANCE BUT ALL WAS SILENT SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD SHE CONVICTED HER FANCY OF ERROR WHEN THE NOISE OF SOMETHING MOVING CLOSE TO HER DOOR MADE HER START
AND HENRY'S GRATIFIED LOOK ON BEING TOLD THAT HER STAY WAS DETERMINED
FOR ONE LETTER AT ALL RISKS ALL HAZARDS I MUST ENTREAT
THEY BY WHOM ABOVE ALL SHE DESIRED TO BE FAVOURABLY THOUGHT OF OUTSTRIPPED EVEN HER WISHES IN THE FLATTERING MEASURES BY WHICH THEIR INTIMACY WAS TO BE CONTINUED SHE WAS TO BE THEIR CHOSEN VISITOR
THE VERY CARRIAGE IS ORDERED AND WILL BE HERE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AND NO SERVANT WILL BE OFFERED YOU CATHERINE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS AND SPEECHLESS I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY SENSES WHEN I HEARD IT
SOON AFTER SIX ELEANOR ENTERED HER ROOM EAGER TO SHOW ATTENTION OR GIVE ASSISTANCE WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT VERY LITTLE REMAINED TO BE DONE
BUT IT IS NOT A TRIFLE THAT WILL SUPPORT A FAMILY NOWADAYS AND AFTER ALL THAT ROMANCERS MAY SAY THERE IS NO DOING WITHOUT MONEY I ONLY WONDER JOHN COULD THINK OF IT HE COULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED MY LAST YOU DO ACQUIT ME THEN OF ANYTHING WRONG
THOUGH EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO COME IN
I WILL TRUST TO YOUR OWN KINDNESS OF HEART WHEN I AM AT A DISTANCE FROM YOU BUT THIS WITH THE LOOK OF SORROW ACCOMPANYING IT WAS ENOUGH TO MELT CATHERINE'S PRIDE IN A MOMENT AND SHE INSTANTLY SAID OH ELEANOR I WILL WRITE TO YOU INDEED
TURNED FROM THE HOUSE AND IN SUCH A WAY
WHO COULD SAY WHEN THEY MIGHT MEET AGAIN AND ALL THIS BY SUCH A MAN AS GENERAL TILNEY SO POLITE SO WELL BRED AND HERETOFORE SO PARTICULARLY FOND OF HER IT WAS AS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AS IT WAS MORTIFYING AND GRIEVOUS
WHAT CAN HE WRITE ABOUT BUT YOURSELF YOU KNOW HE IS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH YOU WITH ME DEAR ISABELLA NAY MY SWEETEST CATHERINE THIS IS BEING QUITE ABSURD
BUT IT IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE I HOPE I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT TO YOUR REAL SAFETY IT WILL BE OF NONE BUT TO EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMFORT APPEARANCE PROPRIETY
MY DAUGHTER MISS MORLAND HE CONTINUED WITHOUT LEAVING HIS DAUGHTER TIME TO SPEAK HAS BEEN FORMING A VERY BOLD WISH WE LEAVE BATH AS SHE HAS PERHAPS TOLD YOU ON SATURDAY
BUT HOW CAN I TELL YOU TOMORROW MORNING IS FIXED FOR YOUR LEAVING US
CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE OPINIONS ALTER BUT MY OPINION OF YOUR BROTHER NEVER DID ALTER IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME YOU ARE DESCRIBING WHAT NEVER HAPPENED MY DEAREST CATHERINE CONTINUED THE OTHER WITHOUT AT ALL LISTENING TO HER
AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST THIS ROOF WAS TO BE THE ROOF OF AN ABBEY HER PASSION FOR ANCIENT EDIFICES WAS NEXT IN DEGREE TO HER PASSION FOR HENRY TILNEY
THOUGH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED IN SPEAKING OF IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER THAT AFTER SO LONG AN ABSENCE FROM HOME CATHERINE MIGHT NOT BE PROVIDED WITH MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE EXPENSES OF HER JOURNEY AND UPON SUGGESTING IT TO HER WITH MOST AFFECTIONATE OFFERS OF ACCOMMODATION
I AM EXCESSIVELY CONCERNED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ANY REGARD FOR ME BUT INDEED IT HAS BEEN QUITE UNINTENTIONAL ON MY SIDE I NEVER HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF IT PRAY UNDECEIVE HIM AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND TELL HIM I BEG HIS PARDON THAT IS
THE ENGAGEMENTS OF HIS CURATE AT WOODSTON OBLIGING HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON SATURDAY
CATHERINE WALKED ON TO HER CHAMBER MAKING UP HER MIND AS WELL AS SHE COULD TO A FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY AND COMFORTING HERSELF UNDER THE UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION HIS CONDUCT HAD GIVEN HER
BUT DID NOT RUIN THEIR COMFORT
SHE HAD BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED OF BEING ARCH THOUGHT THE PRESENT A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR BEING REALLY SO AND THEREFORE GAILY SAID DO NOT BE UNEASY ISABELLA JAMES WILL SOON BE HERE PSHA MY DEAR CREATURE SHE REPLIED DO NOT THINK
MY DEAR ELEANOR CRIED CATHERINE SUPPRESSING HER FEELINGS AS WELL AS SHE COULD DO NOT BE SO DISTRESSED A SECOND ENGAGEMENT MUST GIVE WAY TO A FIRST
HOWEVER IT IS NOT WORTH ARGUING ABOUT FOR WHATEVER MIGHT PASS ON HIS SIDE YOU MUST BE CONVINCED BY MY HAVING NO RECOLLECTION OF IT THAT I NEVER THOUGHT NOR EXPECTED NOR WISHED FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND FROM HIM
RESTRAINT WHICH THE GENERAL'S PRESENCE HAD IMPOSED AND MOST THANKFULLY FEEL THEIR PRESENT RELEASE FROM IT SUCH EASE AND SUCH DELIGHTS MADE HER LOVE THE PLACE AND THE PEOPLE MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY
THAN MISS TILNEY TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK HERE WAS A BLOW THE PAST SUSPENSE OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT
I TRUST YOU WILL ACQUIT ME FOR YOU MUST HAVE BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN THIS HOUSE TO SEE THAT I AM BUT A NOMINAL MISTRESS OF IT THAT MY REAL POWER IS NOTHING HAVE I OFFENDED THE GENERAL SAID CATHERINE IN A FALTERING VOICE
PROPOSE GOING AWAY AND BE GUIDED IN HER CONDUCT BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HER PROPOSAL MIGHT BE TAKEN AWARE THAT IF SHE GAVE HERSELF MUCH TIME SHE MIGHT FEEL IT DIFFICULT TO BRING FORWARD SO UNPLEASANT A SUBJECT
TO YOUR FAMILY TO THE WORLD WERE YOUR FRIENDS THE ALLENS STILL IN BATH YOU MIGHT GO TO THEM WITH COMPARATIVE EASE A FEW HOURS WOULD TAKE YOU THERE BUT A JOURNEY OF SEVENTY MILES TO BE TAKEN POST BY YOU AT YOUR AGE ALONE UNATTENDED
I WOULD NOT FOR ALL THE WORLD BE THE MEANS OF HURRYING YOU INTO AN ENGAGEMENT BEFORE YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT I DO NOT THINK ANYTHING WOULD JUSTIFY ME IN WISHING YOU TO SACRIFICE ALL YOUR HAPPINESS MERELY TO OBLIGE MY BROTHER
WE MAY EXPECT PHILOSOPHY FROM ALL THE WORLD MISS TILNEY WAS EARNEST THOUGH GENTLE IN HER SECONDARY CIVILITIES AND THE AFFAIR BECAME IN A FEW MINUTES AS NEARLY SETTLED AS THIS NECESSARY REFERENCE TO FULLERTON WOULD ALLOW
YET NO ENDEAVOURS SHALL BE WANTING ON OUR SIDE TO MAKE NORTHANGER ABBEY NOT WHOLLY DISAGREEABLE NORTHANGER ABBEY THESE WERE THRILLING WORDS AND WOUND UP CATHERINE'S FEELINGS TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF ECSTASY
EVEN OF DECENT CIVILITY DEAR DEAR CATHERINE IN BEING THE BEARER OF SUCH A MESSAGE I SEEM GUILTY MYSELF OF ALL ITS INSULT YET
AS TO ANY ATTENTIONS ON HIS SIDE I DO DECLARE UPON MY HONOUR I NEVER WAS SENSIBLE OF THEM FOR A MOMENT EXCEPT JUST HIS ASKING ME TO DANCE THE FIRST DAY OF HIS COMING
AND CASTLES AND ABBEYS MADE USUALLY THE CHARM OF THOSE REVERIES WHICH HIS IMAGE DID NOT FILL TO SEE AND EXPLORE EITHER THE RAMPARTS AND KEEP OF THE ONE OR THE CLOISTERS OF THE OTHER HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS A DARLING WISH
THERE COULD BE NO DANGER OF IT AND AS LONG AS ALL MENTION OF BATH SCENES WERE AVOIDED SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD BEHAVE TO HIM VERY CIVILLY IN SUCH CONSIDERATIONS TIME PASSED AWAY
WHICH COMMANDED A TOLERABLE VIEW OF EVERYBODY ENTERING AT EITHER IT IS SO OUT OF THE WAY CATHERINE OBSERVING THAT ISABELLA'S EYES WERE CONTINUALLY BENT TOWARDS ONE DOOR OR THE OTHER AS IN EAGER EXPECTATION AND REMEMBERING HOW OFTEN
AND AN APPREHENSION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY BELOVED BY THE OTHER SHE WOULD AT EACH MOMENT OF EACH DAY HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY BUT SHE WAS NOW IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF HER VISIT BEFORE THE GENERAL CAME HOME
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN IN THE PROPEREST WAY I WOULD NOT SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF A BROTHER OF YOURS ISABELLA I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT IF I COULD THINK OF ONE MAN MORE THAN ANOTHER
AND HUNG OVER HER WITH AFFECTIONATE SOLICITUDE MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU MUST NOT YOU MUST NOT INDEED WERE ELEANOR'S FIRST CONNECTED WORDS I AM QUITE WELL THIS KINDNESS DISTRACTS ME
WHICH CATHERINE WAS BEGINNING TO HOPE MIGHT INTRODUCE A DESIRE OF THEIR CORRESPONDING AFTER ADDRESSING HER WITH HIS USUAL POLITENESS HE TURNED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND SAID WELL ELEANOR
FOUND THEMSELVES SO WELL SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME TO THEMSELVES THAT IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK RATHER A LATE HOUR AT THE ABBEY BEFORE THEY QUITTED THE SUPPER ROOM ON THE DAY OF HENRY'S DEPARTURE THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS WHEN IT SEEMED
ME SUCH A SIMPLETON AS TO BE ALWAYS WANTING TO CONFINE HIM TO MY ELBOW IT WOULD BE HIDEOUS TO BE ALWAYS TOGETHER WE SHOULD BE THE JEST OF THE PLACE AND SO YOU ARE GOING TO NORTHANGER I AM AMAZINGLY GLAD OF IT
OH BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN THERE SO LONG NAY IF YOU CAN USE SUCH A WORD I CAN URGE YOU NO FARTHER IF YOU THINK IT LONG OH NO I DO NOT INDEED
BUT I CONFESS AS SOON AS I READ HIS LETTER I THOUGHT IT A VERY FOOLISH IMPRUDENT BUSINESS AND NOT LIKELY TO PROMOTE THE GOOD OF EITHER FOR WHAT WERE YOU TO LIVE UPON SUPPOSING YOU CAME TOGETHER YOU HAVE BOTH OF YOU SOMETHING TO BE SURE
PSHA NONSENSE WAS ISABELLA'S ANSWER IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER WHY DO YOU PUT SUCH THINGS INTO MY HEAD IF I COULD BELIEVE IT MY SPIRIT YOU KNOW IS PRETTY INDEPENDENT
TILNEY SAYS IT IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH MINDS OF A CERTAIN STAMP BUT I THOUGHT ISABELLA YOU HAD SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR TO TELL ME OH YES AND SO I HAVE BUT HERE IS A PROOF OF WHAT I WAS SAYING
AND A STILL GREATER TO SPEAK WHEN THERE CATHERINE SUPPOSING SOME UNEASINESS ON CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ACCOUNT COULD ONLY EXPRESS HER CONCERN BY SILENT ATTENTION OBLIGED HER TO BE SEATED RUBBED HER TEMPLES WITH LAVENDER WATER
SHE WAS EXPECTING HER SISTERS EVERY MOMENT SO THAT HER DEAREST CATHERINE MUST EXCUSE HER AND MUST SIT QUIETLY DOWN AGAIN BUT CATHERINE COULD BE STUBBORN TOO AND MISSUS ALLEN JUST THEN COMING UP TO PROPOSE THEIR RETURNING HOME
AND FEW AND TRIVIAL WERE THE SENTENCES EXCHANGED WHILE THEY REMAINED UPSTAIRS CATHERINE IN BUSY AGITATION COMPLETING HER DRESS AND ELEANOR WITH MORE GOODWILL THAN EXPERIENCE INTENT UPON FILLING THE TRUNK WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE THEY LEFT THE ROOM
THAN YOURSELF MODESTY SUCH AS YOURS BUT NOT FOR THE WORLD WOULD I PAIN IT BY OPEN PRAISE IF YOU CAN BE INDUCED TO HONOUR US WITH A VISIT YOU WILL MAKE US HAPPY BEYOND EXPRESSION TIS TRUE
AND THE DISTRESS IN WHICH SHE MUST HAVE BEEN THEREBY INVOLVED FILLING THE MINDS OF BOTH SCARCELY ANOTHER WORD WAS SAID BY EITHER DURING THE TIME OF THEIR REMAINING TOGETHER SHORT HOWEVER WAS THAT TIME THE CARRIAGE WAS SOON ANNOUNCED TO BE READY
TO THINK THE WORSE OF ME FOR THE PART I AM OBLIGED TO PERFORM I AM INDEED A MOST UNWILLING MESSENGER AFTER WHAT HAS SO LATELY PASSED SO LATELY BEEN SETTLED BETWEEN US HOW JOYFULLY HOW THANKFULLY ON MY SIDE
MODESTY AND ALL THAT IS VERY WELL IN ITS WAY BUT REALLY A LITTLE COMMON HONESTY IS SOMETIMES QUITE AS BECOMING I HAVE NO IDEA OF BEING SO OVERSTRAINED IT IS FISHING FOR COMPLIMENTS HIS ATTENTIONS WERE SUCH AS A CHILD MUST HAVE NOTICED
OF NORTHANGER ABBEY HAVING BEEN A RICHLY ENDOWED CONVENT AT THE TIME OF THE REFORMATION OF ITS HAVING FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF AN ANCESTOR OF THE TILNEYS ON ITS DISSOLUTION
IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST OLD PLACES IN ENGLAND I UNDERSTAND I SHALL DEPEND UPON A MOST PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF IT YOU SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE THE BEST IN MY POWER TO GIVE BUT WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ARE YOUR SISTERS COMING
SINCE THAT IS THE CASE I AM SURE I SHALL NOT TEASE YOU ANY FURTHER
BECAUSE HE IS MY BROTHER AND WHO PERHAPS AFTER ALL YOU KNOW MIGHT BE JUST AS HAPPY WITHOUT YOU FOR PEOPLE SELDOM KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD BE AT YOUNG MEN ESPECIALLY THEY ARE SO AMAZINGLY CHANGEABLE AND INCONSTANT
TO APPROVE OF HER THAT AT LEAST THEY SHOULD NOT MEET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS WOULD MAKE THEIR MEETING MATERIALLY PAINFUL SHE TRUSTED HE WOULD NEVER SPEAK OF MISS THORPE AND INDEED AS HE MUST BY THIS TIME BE ASHAMED OF THE PART HE HAD ACTED
AS LEFT HER ONLY JUST SO MUCH SOLICITUDE AS THE HUMAN MIND CAN NEVER DO COMFORTABLY WITHOUT SHE DID ALMOST ALWAYS
A LETTER FROM MY STEWARD TELLS ME THAT MY PRESENCE IS WANTED AT HOME AND BEING DISAPPOINTED IN MY HOPE OF SEEING THE MARQUIS OF LONGTOWN AND GENERAL COURTENEY HERE SOME OF MY VERY OLD FRIENDS THERE IS NOTHING TO DETAIN ME LONGER IN BATH
SO IT IS IN VAIN TO AFFECT IGNORANCE
BUT CATHERINE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY INJURY OR ANY MISFORTUNE COULD PROVOKE SUCH ILL WILL AGAINST A PERSON NOT CONNECTED OR AT LEAST
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS JUST MADE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT SHE LEFT HER KIND REMEMBRANCE FOR HER ABSENT FRIEND
TO START FORTH HER OBLIGATION OF GOING AWAY VERY SOON ELEANOR LOOKED AND DECLARED HERSELF MUCH CONCERNED SHE HAD HOPED FOR THE PLEASURE OF HER COMPANY FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME HAD BEEN MISLED PERHAPS BY HER WISHES
I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO MAKE THE REQUEST THOUGH
AH HERE HE COMES NEVER MIND HE WILL NOT SEE US I AM SURE CATHERINE LOOKING UP PERCEIVED CAPTAIN TILNEY AND ISABELLA EARNESTLY FIXING HER EYE ON HIM AS SHE SPOKE SOON CAUGHT HIS NOTICE
WITH MUCH UNEASINESS DID SHE THUS LEAVE THEM IT SEEMED TO HER THAT CAPTAIN TILNEY WAS FALLING IN LOVE WITH ISABELLA AND ISABELLA UNCONSCIOUSLY ENCOURAGING HIM
WAS AN EVIL WHICH NOTHING COULD COUNTERBALANCE HER WHOLE HAPPINESS SEEMED AT STAKE WHILE THE AFFAIR WAS IN SUSPENSE
BUT I MUST NOT TRUST MYSELF WITH WORDS MY DEAR CATHERINE WE ARE TO PART MY FATHER HAS RECOLLECTED AN ENGAGEMENT THAT TAKES OUR WHOLE FAMILY AWAY ON MONDAY WE ARE GOING TO LORD LONGTOWN'S NEAR HEREFORD FOR A FORTNIGHT
ISABELLA WAS SILENT MY DEAR FRIEND YOU MUST NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME I CANNOT SUPPOSE YOUR BROTHER CARES SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ME AND YOU KNOW WE SHALL STILL BE SISTERS
FROM WHAT IT COULD ARISE AND WHERE IT WOULD END WERE CONSIDERATIONS OF EQUAL PERPLEXITY AND ALARM THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS DONE SO GROSSLY UNCIVIL HURRYING HER AWAY WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO HER OWN CONVENIENCE
ALL THAT I KNOW ALL THAT I ANSWER FOR IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE GIVEN HIM NO JUST CAUSE OF OFFENCE HE CERTAINLY IS GREATLY VERY GREATLY DISCOMPOSED I HAVE SELDOM SEEN HIM MORE SO HIS TEMPER IS NOT HAPPY
HER CHIEF PROFIT WAS IN WONDER THAT HE SHOULD THINK IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO FANCY HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER WAS A MATTER OF LIVELY ASTONISHMENT
IT SEEMED AS IF SOMEONE WAS TOUCHING THE VERY DOORWAY AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT A SLIGHT MOTION OF THE LOCK PROVED THAT SOME HAND MUST BE ON IT SHE TREMBLED A LITTLE AT THE IDEA OF ANYONE'S APPROACHING SO CAUTIOUSLY
SHE ROSE UP AND SAYING SHE SHOULD JOIN MISSUS ALLEN PROPOSED THEIR WALKING BUT FOR THIS ISABELLA SHOWED NO INCLINATION SHE WAS SO AMAZINGLY TIRED AND IT WAS SO ODIOUS TO PARADE ABOUT THE PUMP ROOM AND IF SHE MOVED FROM HER SEAT SHE SHOULD MISS HER SISTERS
NOW LEFT HER WITH I SHALL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING CATHERINE'S SWELLING HEART NEEDED RELIEF IN ELEANOR'S PRESENCE FRIENDSHIP AND PRIDE HAD EQUALLY RESTRAINED HER TEARS BUT NO SOONER WAS SHE GONE THAN THEY BURST FORTH IN TORRENTS
WORSE TO BE TOLD SHE SAID NOTHING AND ELEANOR ENDEAVOURING TO COLLECT HERSELF AND SPEAK WITH FIRMNESS BUT WITH EYES STILL CAST DOWN SOON WENT ON YOU ARE TOO GOOD I AM SURE
BUT RESOLVING NOT TO BE AGAIN OVERCOME BY TRIVIAL APPEARANCES OF ALARM OR MISLED BY A RAISED IMAGINATION SHE STEPPED QUIETLY FORWARD AND OPENED THE DOOR ELEANOR AND ONLY ELEANOR STOOD THERE
GENERAL TILNEY WAS NOT LESS SANGUINE HAVING ALREADY WAITED ON HER EXCELLENT FRIENDS IN PULTENEY STREET AND OBTAINED THEIR SANCTION OF HIS WISHES SINCE THEY CAN CONSENT TO PART WITH YOU SAID HE
YOU KNOW MAKES NO DIFFERENCE I CAN BE READY BY SEVEN LET ME BE CALLED IN TIME
SHE WISHED ISABELLA HAD TALKED MORE LIKE HER USUAL SELF AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT MONEY AND HAD NOT LOOKED SO WELL PLEASED AT THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN TILNEY HOW STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT PERCEIVE HIS ADMIRATION
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED EVEN TO SEE HER WHAT COULD ALL THIS MEAN BUT AN INTENTIONAL AFFRONT BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER SHE MUST HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO OFFEND HIM ELEANOR HAD WISHED TO SPARE HER FROM SO PAINFUL A NOTION
SO SOON AS MONDAY AND YOU ALL GO WELL I AM CERTAIN OF I SHALL BE ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE HOWEVER I NEED NOT GO TILL JUST BEFORE YOU DO YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING HONOURABLE AND SOOTHING EVERY PRESENT ENJOYMENT AND EVERY FUTURE HOPE WAS CONTAINED IN IT
THE GENERAL WILL SEND A SERVANT WITH ME I DARE SAY HALF THE WAY AND THEN I SHALL SOON BE AT SALISBURY AND THEN I AM ONLY NINE MILES FROM HOME AH CATHERINE WERE IT SETTLED SO IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT LESS INTOLERABLE
WITH A MIND THUS FULL OF HAPPINESS CATHERINE WAS HARDLY AWARE THAT TWO OR THREE DAYS HAD PASSED AWAY WITHOUT HER SEEING ISABELLA FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES TOGETHER SHE BEGAN FIRST TO BE SENSIBLE OF THIS AND TO SIGH FOR HER CONVERSATION
MANY WERE THE INQUIRIES SHE WAS EAGER TO MAKE OF MISS TILNEY BUT SO ACTIVE WERE HER THOUGHTS THAT WHEN THESE INQUIRIES WERE ANSWERED SHE WAS HARDLY MORE ASSURED THAN BEFORE
AND BELIEVING SO FAR HER DOUBTS AND ANXIETIES WERE MERELY SPORTIVE IRRITATIONS HENRY WAS NOT ABLE TO OBEY HIS FATHER'S INJUNCTION OF REMAINING WHOLLY AT NORTHANGER IN ATTENDANCE ON THE LADIES DURING HIS ABSENCE IN LONDON
HER ANXIETY HAD FOUNDATION IN FACT HER FEARS IN PROBABILITY AND WITH A MIND SO OCCUPIED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF ACTUAL AND NATURAL EVIL THE SOLITUDE OF HER SITUATION THE DARKNESS OF HER CHAMBER THE ANTIQUITY OF THE BUILDING
TILL SHE HAD HER LEAVING THEM WAS NOT EVEN TO BE THOUGHT OF IN HAVING THIS CAUSE OF UNEASINESS SO PLEASANTLY REMOVED THE FORCE OF THE OTHER WAS LIKEWISE WEAKENED THE KINDNESS THE EARNESTNESS OF ELEANOR'S MANNER IN PRESSING HER TO STAY
OR ALLOWING HER EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF CHOICE AS TO THE TIME OR MODE OF HER TRAVELLING OF TWO DAYS THE EARLIEST FIXED ON AND OF THAT ALMOST THE EARLIEST HOUR AS IF RESOLVED TO HAVE HER GONE BEFORE HE WAS STIRRING IN THE MORNING
CATHERINE'S COUNTENANCE FELL AND IN A VOICE OF MOST SINCERE CONCERN SHE ECHOED MISS TILNEY'S CONCLUDING WORDS BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK
IN FRIENDS AND FORTUNE CIRCUMSTANCE AND CHANCE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO COOPERATE FOR HER ADVANTAGE BY THE KINDNESS OF HER FIRST FRIENDS THE ALLENS SHE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED INTO SCENES WHERE PLEASURES OF EVERY KIND HAD MET HER
I COULD NOT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD A THING OF THAT KIND YOU KNOW
AND COULD WE CARRY OUR SELFISH POINT WITH YOU WE SHOULD LEAVE IT WITHOUT A SINGLE REGRET CAN YOU IN SHORT BE PREVAILED ON TO QUIT THIS SCENE OF PUBLIC TRIUMPH AND OBLIGE YOUR FRIEND ELEANOR WITH YOUR COMPANY IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE
PAPA AND MAMMA WERE IN NO HURRY AT ALL AS LONG AS SHE WAS HAPPY THEY WOULD ALWAYS BE SATISFIED THEN WHY MIGHT SHE ASK
WE CAN OFFER YOU NOTHING LIKE THE GAIETIES OF THIS LIVELY PLACE WE CAN TEMPT YOU NEITHER BY AMUSEMENT NOR SPLENDOUR FOR OUR MODE OF LIVING AS YOU SEE IS PLAIN AND UNPRETENDING
AND IT WAS BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE LEFT BATH THAT YOU GAVE HIM THE MOST POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT HE SAYS SO IN THIS LETTER SAYS THAT HE AS GOOD AS MADE YOU AN OFFER
STRIKING AT THAT INSTANT ON HER MIND WITH PECULIAR FORCE
HER FEELINGS HER PREFERENCES HAD EACH KNOWN THE HAPPINESS OF A RETURN WHEREVER SHE FELT ATTACHMENT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IT THE AFFECTION OF ISABELLA WAS TO BE SECURED TO HER IN A SISTER THE TILNEYS
SO SOON AND SO SUDDENLY TOO BUT I AM NOT OFFENDED INDEED I AM NOT I CAN FINISH MY VISIT HERE YOU KNOW AT ANY TIME OR I HOPE YOU WILL COME TO ME CAN YOU WHEN YOU RETURN FROM THIS LORD'S COME TO FULLERTON
IN A GOOD HEAVEN WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER IT WAS QUICKLY DECIDED BY ELEANOR TO BE HER ELDEST BROTHER WHOSE ARRIVAL WAS OFTEN AS SUDDEN IF NOT QUITE SO UNSEASONABLE AND ACCORDINGLY SHE HURRIED DOWN TO WELCOME HIM
AND TURNING AS PALE AS HER FRIEND SHE EXCLAIMED TIS A MESSENGER FROM WOODSTON YOU ARE MISTAKEN INDEED RETURNED ELEANOR LOOKING AT HER MOST COMPASSIONATELY IT IS NO ONE FROM WOODSTON IT IS MY FATHER HIMSELF
THE COMPLIMENT OF JOHN THORPE'S AFFECTION DID NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR THIS THOUGHTLESSNESS IN HIS SISTER SHE WAS ALMOST AS FAR FROM BELIEVING AS FROM WISHING IT TO BE SINCERE FOR SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT HE COULD MISTAKE
AS FAR AS THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO JUDGE THAT A CARRIAGE WAS DRIVING UP TO THE DOOR AND THE NEXT MOMENT CONFIRMED THE IDEA BY THE LOUD NOISE OF THE HOUSE BELL AFTER THE FIRST PERTURBATION OF SURPRISE HAD PASSED AWAY
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO HIM I HOPE SAID THE COUNT FROWNINGLY THE PRISONER IS THERE REPLIED VAMPA POINTING TO THE HOLLOW SPACE IN FRONT OF WHICH THE BANDIT WAS ON GUARD AND I WILL GO MYSELF AND TELL HIM HE IS FREE THE CHIEF WENT TOWARDS THE PLACE HE HAD POINTED
WENT UP THE STRADA SAN GREGORIO AND REACHED THE GATES OF SAINT SEBASTIAN
SAID THE COUNT BUT PEPPINO INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES SEIZED THE COUNT'S HAND AND COVERED IT WITH KISSES AH SAID THE COUNT YOU HAVE THEN NOT FORGOTTEN THAT I SAVED YOUR LIFE
THE STREET WAS SAFER FOR HIM ALBERT THEN HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE FAMOUS BANDIT CHIEF IN WHOSE EXISTENCE HE HAD FOR SO LONG A TIME REFUSED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE HE HASTENED TO OPEN THE SECRETARY
FIVE CORRIDORS DIVERGED LIKE THE RAYS OF A STAR AND THE WALLS DUG INTO NICHES WHICH WERE ARRANGED ONE ABOVE THE OTHER IN THE SHAPE OF COFFINS SHOWED THAT THEY WERE AT LAST IN THE CATACOMBS DOWN ONE OF THE CORRIDORS WHOSE EXTENT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE
WHO GAINED THE PRIZE IN THE RACE TO DAY REPLIED FRANZ AND THEN MOREOVER WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO HIM WHO CAN TELL
LET US FOLLOW HIM FRANZ AND THE COUNT IN THEIR TURN THEN ADVANCED ALONG THE SAME PATH WHICH AT THE DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED PACES LED THEM OVER A DECLIVITY TO THE BOTTOM OF A SMALL VALLEY THEY THEN PERCEIVED TWO MEN CONVERSING IN THE OBSCURITY
BEPPO GOT IN INVITING THE FRENCHMAN TO FOLLOW HIM AND HE DID NOT WAIT TO BE ASKED TWICE HE GALLANTLY OFFERED THE RIGHT HAND SEAT TO BEPPO AND SAT BY HIM BEPPO TOLD HIM HE WAS GOING TO TAKE HIM TO A VILLA A LEAGUE FROM ROME
I PREFER WAITING HERE SAID THE MESSENGER WITH A SMILE AND WHY YOUR EXCELLENCY WILL KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE READ THE LETTER
NO EXCELLENCY AND NEVER SHALL I FORGET IT RETURNED PEPPINO WITH AN ACCENT OF PROFOUND GRATITUDE NEVER THAT IS A LONG TIME
SAID ALBERT GAYLY ARRANGING HIS CRAVAT AND WRISTBANDS
I WAS NEVER IN THEM BUT I HAVE OFTEN RESOLVED TO VISIT THEM
ANYTHING FRANZ RESOLVED TO WAIT FOR ALBERT AS LATE AS POSSIBLE
THEN IT IS TO YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT THIS LETTER IS ADDRESSED IS THERE ANY ANSWER INQUIRED FRANZ TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIM YES YOUR FRIEND AT LEAST HOPES SO COME UP STAIRS WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU
THE ROAD WHICH THE CARRIAGE NOW TRAVERSED WAS THE ANCIENT APPIAN WAY AND BORDERED WITH TOMBS FROM TIME TO TIME
AND WHICH WAS SURROUNDED WITH DIVANS THE COUNT CAME TOWARDS HIM WELL WHAT GOOD WIND BLOWS YOU HITHER AT THIS HOUR SAID HE HAVE YOU COME TO SUP WITH ME IT WOULD BE VERY KIND OF YOU NO I HAVE COME TO SPEAK TO YOU OF A VERY SERIOUS MATTER
THAT HE WAS GOING TO PASS THE NIGHT AT THE DUKE OF BRACCIANO'S THE HOUSE OF THE DUKE OF BRACCIANO IS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL IN ROME THE DUCHESS ONE OF THE LAST HEIRESSES OF THE COLONNAS DOES ITS HONORS WITH THE MOST CONSUMMATE GRACE AND THUS THEIR FETES
AND THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE DOOR THE COUNT TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HALF PAST TWELVE HE SAID
AND HE LIGHTED HIS CIGAR AT VAMPA'S TORCH NOW MY DEAR COUNT HE SAID LET US ON WITH ALL THE SPEED WE MAY I AM ENORMOUSLY ANXIOUS TO FINISH MY NIGHT AT THE DUKE OF BRACCIANO'S THEY FOUND THE CARRIAGE WHERE THEY HAD LEFT IT
PLENTY OF OTHERS AND BEPPO LED HIM OUTSIDE THE WALLS SAID THE COUNT
IT APPEARS TO ME THAT YOU RECEIVE A FRIEND WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CEREMONY GROUND ARMS EXCLAIMED THE CHIEF WITH AN IMPERATIVE SIGN OF THE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY THEN TURNING TO THE SINGULAR PERSONAGE WHO HAD CAUSED THIS SCENE HE SAID
FRANZ AND THE COUNT GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE PEPPINO PLACED HIMSELF BESIDE ALI AND THEY SET OFF AT A RAPID PACE ALI HAD RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND WENT DOWN THE CORSO CROSSED THE CAMPO VACCINO
NO NOT PRECISELY HOWEVER I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING VERY LIKE A RENDEZVOUS DIAVOLO SAID THE DUKE THIS IS A BAD DAY OR RATHER A BAD NIGHT TO BE OUT LATE IS IT NOT COUNTESS THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED TO THE COUNTESS G
CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN THE CATACOMBS OF SAINT SEBASTIAN IN HIS WHOLE LIFE PERHAPS FRANZ HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED SO SUDDEN AN IMPRESSION SO RAPID A TRANSITION
WHO WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN BEFORE A GROTTO WHICH WAS ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE BECAUSE IN THAT SPOT THE DARKNESS SEEMED MORE DENSE THAN ELSEWHERE WHEN THE COUNT THOUGHT FRANZ HAD GAZED SUFFICIENTLY ON THIS PICTURESQUE TABLEAU HE RAISED HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS
BE PRUDENT IN ANY EVENT SAID THE COUNTESS OH PRAY BE ASSURED OF THAT FRANZ TOOK HIS HAT AND WENT AWAY IN HASTE HE HAD SENT AWAY HIS CARRIAGE WITH ORDERS FOR IT TO FETCH HIM AT TWO O'CLOCK FORTUNATELY
BUT HE WILL NOT MAKE ANY DIFFICULTY AT ENTERING MINE
I DO NOT SAY MORE RELYING ON YOU AS YOU MAY RELY ON ME YOUR FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF P S I NOW BELIEVE IN ITALIAN BANDITTI BELOW THESE LINES WERE WRITTEN IN A STRANGE HAND THE FOLLOWING IN ITALIAN
IS HARDLY TEN MINUTES WALK FROM THE HOTEL DE LONDRES AS HE CAME NEAR THE HOTEL FRANZ SAW A MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS THE MESSENGER FROM ALBERT THE MAN WAS WRAPPED UP IN A LARGE CLOAK
THAT HE DID NOT HEAR THE NOISE OF HIS FOOTSTEPS WHO COMES THERE CRIED THE SENTINEL WHO WAS LESS ABSTRACTED AND WHO SAW BY THE LAMP LIGHT A SHADOW APPROACHING HIS CHIEF AT THIS CHALLENGE VAMPA ROSE QUICKLY DRAWING AT THE SAME MOMENT A PISTOL FROM HIS GIRDLE
A SERIOUS MATTER SAID THE COUNT LOOKING AT FRANZ WITH THE EARNESTNESS USUAL TO HIM AND WHAT MAY IT BE ARE WE ALONE YES REPLIED THE COUNT GOING TO THE DOOR AND RETURNING FRANZ GAVE HIM ALBERT'S LETTER READ THAT HE SAID THE COUNT READ IT
AND YET I REPEAT TO YOU YOU HAVE CARRIED HIM OFF AND CONVEYED HIM HITHER AND ADDED THE COUNT TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET YOU HAVE SET A RANSOM ON HIM AS IF HE WERE AN UTTER STRANGER WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME ALL THIS
HERE WAS ONE WHOSE GAY TEMPERAMENT WAS NOT FOR A MOMENT ALTERED AS FOR FRANZ HE WAS ENCHANTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH ALBERT HAD SUSTAINED THE NATIONAL HONOR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BANDIT MY DEAR ALBERT HE SAID IF YOU WILL MAKE HASTE
FRANZ IMAGINED THAT HE SAW SOMETHING LIKE A SENTINEL
CERTAINLY FRANZ ENTERED THE HOTEL ON THE STAIRCASE HE MET SIGNOR PASTRINI WELL SAID THE LANDLORD
IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS YOU ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU THIS TITLE CONTINUED THE COUNT IN FRENCH IT IS NECESSARY TO EXCITE THIS MAN'S CONFIDENCE YOU CAN SPEAK BEFORE ME SAID FRANZ I AM A FRIEND OF THE COUNT'S GOOD RETURNED PEPPINO I
WHICH HAD REPLACED THE LIGHT AND THE SILENCE WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED THE TURMOIL HAD LEFT IN FRANZ'S MIND A CERTAIN DEPRESSION WHICH WAS NOT FREE FROM UNEASINESS HE THEREFORE DINED VERY SILENTLY IN SPITE OF THE OFFICIOUS ATTENTION OF HIS HOST
IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME THE OPENING OF THE CATACOMBS IS CLOSE AT HAND GO ON THEN REPLIED THE COUNT THEY CAME TO AN OPENING BEHIND A CLUMP OF BUSHES AND IN THE MIDST OF A PILE OF ROCKS BY WHICH A MAN COULD SCARCELY PASS
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO GO SAID THE DUKE TO FRANZ YOU WHO KNOW ROME BETTER THAN HE DOES
TO THEM BOTH TO MAKE UP THE SUM THAT ALBERT REQUIRED TRUE HE MIGHT IN SUCH A CASE RELY ON THE KINDNESS OF SIGNOR TORLONIA HE WAS THEREFORE ABOUT TO RETURN TO THE PALAZZO BRACCIANO WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME WHEN SUDDENLY A LUMINOUS IDEA CROSSED HIS MIND
AS HE LIVED AT FLORENCE AND HAD ONLY COME TO ROME TO PASS SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS HE HAD BROUGHT BUT A HUNDRED LOUIS AND OF THESE HE HAD NOT MORE THAN FIFTY LEFT THUS SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED PIASTRES WERE WANTING
HAVE YOU THE MONEY HE DEMANDS YES ALL BUT EIGHT HUNDRED PIASTRES THE COUNT WENT TO HIS SECRETARY OPENED IT AND PULLING OUT A DRAWER FILLED WITH GOLD SAID TO FRANZ
AT WHICH I HAD FIXED YOUR FRIEND'S RANSOM THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED BUT SAID FRANZ LOOKING ROUND HIM UNEASILY
YOU ARE DECIDEDLY RIGHT AND WE MAY REACH THE PALAZZO BY TWO O'CLOCK SIGNOR LUIGI CONTINUED ALBERT
NO MATTER I KNOW IT THE COUNT KNIT HIS BROWS AND REMAINED SILENT AN INSTANT AND IF I WENT TO SEEK VAMPA WOULD YOU ACCOMPANY ME IF MY SOCIETY WOULD NOT BE DISAGREEABLE BE IT SO
WHO WERE CONCEALED ON THE BANKS OF THE ALMO SURROUNDED THE CARRIAGE THE FRENCHMAN MADE SOME RESISTANCE AND NEARLY STRANGLED BEPPO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST FIVE ARMED MEN AND WAS FORCED TO YIELD THEY MADE HIM GET OUT WALK ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER
TO AWAKEN ALBERT STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS RUBBED HIS EYELIDS AND OPENED HIS EYES OH SAID HE IS IT YOU CAPTAIN
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT WHY THAT I SHOULD THINK IT VERY AMUSING REPLIED FRANZ IF IT HAD HAPPENED TO ANY ONE BUT POOR ALBERT AND IN TRUTH IF YOU HAD NOT FOUND ME HERE SAID THE COUNT
THE POSTSCRIPT IS EXPLICIT I THINK THAT IF YOU WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE OF REFLECTING YOU COULD FIND A WAY OF SIMPLIFYING THE NEGOTIATION SAID FRANZ HOW SO RETURNED THE COUNT WITH SURPRISE IF WE WERE TO GO TOGETHER TO LUIGI VAMPA
AND I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER ME AS UNDER ETERNAL OBLIGATIONS TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR THE CARRIAGE
ANY MONEY IT IS USELESS WHERE IS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT THE LETTER IN THE STREET HE AWAITS THE ANSWER YES I MUST LEARN WHERE WE ARE GOING I WILL SUMMON HIM HITHER IT IS USELESS HE WOULD NOT COME UP TO YOUR APARTMENTS PERHAPS
IN A MOMENT ALL THE BANDITS WERE ON THEIR FEET AND TWENTY CARBINES WERE LEVELLED AT THE COUNT WELL SAID HE IN A VOICE PERFECTLY CALM AND NO MUSCLE OF HIS COUNTENANCE DISTURBED WELL MY DEAR VAMPA

THAT SOMETIMES WHEN I RISE OR AFTER MY DINNER OR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I RESOLVE ON STARTING FOR SOME PARTICULAR POINT AND AWAY I GO THE COUNT RANG AND A FOOTMAN APPEARED ORDER OUT THE CARRIAGE HE SAID
AS IN THIS MOMENT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ROME UNDER THE MAGIC BREATH OF SOME DEMON OF THE NIGHT HAD SUDDENLY CHANGED INTO A VAST TOMB BY A CHANCE WHICH ADDED YET MORE TO THE INTENSITY OF THE DARKNESS THE MOON WHICH WAS ON THE WANE
OUT AS ALBERT'S PRISON AND FRANZ AND THE COUNT FOLLOWED HIM WHAT IS THE PRISONER DOING INQUIRED VAMPA OF THE SENTINEL MA FOI CAPTAIN REPLIED THE SENTRY I DO NOT KNOW FOR THE LAST HOUR I HAVE NOT HEARD HIM STIR

RAYS OF LIGHT WERE VISIBLE THE COUNT LAID HIS HAND ON FRANZ'S SHOULDER WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A CAMP OF BANDITS IN REPOSE HE INQUIRED EXCEEDINGLY REPLIED FRANZ COME WITH ME THEN PEPPINO PUT OUT THE TORCH PEPPINO OBEYED
IT MIGHT HAVE PROVED A GALLANT ADVENTURE WHICH WOULD HAVE COST YOUR FRIEND DEAR BUT NOW BE ASSURED HIS ALARM WILL BE THE ONLY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE AND SHALL WE GO AND FIND HIM INQUIRED FRANZ
ALLOWING HIM TO LEAVE OR ENTER THE CITY AT ANY HOUR OF THE DAY OR NIGHT THE PORTCULLIS WAS THEREFORE RAISED THE PORTER HAD A LOUIS FOR HIS TROUBLE
AND THEREFORE WE HAD BETTER GO WITH ALL SPEED TO EXTRICATE HIM FROM THE HANDS OF THE INFIDELS ARE YOU STILL RESOLVED TO ACCOMPANY ME MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER WELL THEN COME ALONG FRANZ AND THE COUNT WENT DOWNSTAIRS ACCOMPANIED BY PEPPINO
INQUIRED THE BRIGAND CHIEF TURNING TOWARDS HIS MEN WHO ALL RETREATED BEFORE HIS LOOK WHY HAVE YOU CAUSED ME THUS TO FAIL IN MY WORD TOWARDS A GENTLEMAN LIKE THE COUNT WHO HAS ALL OUR LIVES IN HIS HANDS
HAVE WHAT YOU WILL AND HE MADE A SIGN TO FRANZ TO TAKE WHAT HE PLEASED IS IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THEN TO SEND THE MONEY TO LUIGI VAMPA ASKED THE YOUNG MAN LOOKING FIXEDLY IN HIS TURN AT THE COUNT
PEPPINO GLIDED FIRST INTO THIS CREVICE AFTER THEY GOT ALONG A FEW PACES THE PASSAGE WIDENED PEPPINO PASSED LIGHTED HIS TORCH AND TURNED TO SEE IF THEY CAME AFTER HIM THE COUNT FIRST REACHED AN OPEN SPACE AND FRANZ FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY
HE WENT UP TO HIM BUT TO HIS EXTREME ASTONISHMENT THE STRANGER FIRST ADDRESSED HIM WHAT WANTS YOUR EXCELLENCY OF ME INQUIRED THE MAN RETREATING A STEP OR TWO AS IF TO KEEP ON HIS GUARD
ALBERT LOOKED AROUND AND PERCEIVED FRANZ WHAT SAID HE IS IT YOU MY DEAR FRANZ WHOSE DEVOTION AND FRIENDSHIP ARE THUS DISPLAYED NO NOT I REPLIED FRANZ BUT OUR NEIGHBOR THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO OH MY DEAR COUNT
NONE SIR REPLIED THE BANDIT YOU ARE AS FREE AS AIR
YOUR PARDON YOUR EXCELLENCY BUT I WAS SO FAR FROM EXPECTING THE HONOR OF A VISIT THAT I DID NOT REALLY RECOGNIZE YOU IT SEEMS THAT YOUR MEMORY IS EQUALLY SHORT IN EVERYTHING VAMPA SAID THE COUNT AND THAT NOT ONLY DO YOU FORGET PEOPLE'S FACES
SIGNOR PASTRINI DID AS HE WAS DESIRED AND RETURNING FIVE MINUTES AFTER HE SAID THE COUNT AWAITS YOUR EXCELLENCY FRANZ WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND A SERVANT INTRODUCED HIM TO THE COUNT HE WAS IN A SMALL ROOM WHICH FRANZ HAD NOT YET SEEN
AND REMOVE THE PISTOLS WHICH ARE IN THE HOLSTERS YOU NEED NOT AWAKEN THE COACHMAN ALI WILL DRIVE
AND ALBERT FOLLOWED BY FRANZ AND THE COUNT DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE CROSSED THE SQUARE CHAMBER WHERE STOOD ALL THE BANDITS HAT IN HAND PEPPINO SAID THE BRIGAND CHIEF GIVE ME THE TORCH WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO INQUIRED THE COUNT I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY BACK MYSELF
THREE ARCADES WERE BEFORE THEM AND THE MIDDLE ONE WAS USED AS A DOOR THESE ARCADES OPENED ON ONE SIDE INTO THE CORRIDOR WHERE THE COUNT AND FRANZ WERE
HE SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM IN A LOW TONE AND THEN HE LIKE THE FIRST SALUTED THE NOCTURNAL VISITORS MAKING A SIGN THAT THEY MIGHT PROCEED BEHIND THE SENTINEL WAS A STAIRCASE WITH TWENTY STEPS FRANZ AND THE COUNT DESCENDED THESE AND FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MORTUARY CHAMBER
THAN THAT OF FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU AND THE WOMEN OF FALLING ILL OF JEALOUSY AT SEEING YOU SO LOVELY I MEANT PERSONS WHO WERE OUT IN THE STREETS OF ROME AH ASKED THE COUNTESS WHO IS OUT IN THE STREETS OF ROME AT THIS HOUR UNLESS
YOUR EXCELLENCY LODGES AT PASTRINI'S HOTEL I DO
AT THE DOOR THEY FOUND THE CARRIAGE ALI WAS ON THE BOX
AND FOUND THE POCKET BOOK IN THE DRAWER AND IN IT THE LETTER OF CREDIT THERE WERE IN ALL SIX THOUSAND PIASTRES BUT OF THESE SIX THOUSAND ALBERT HAD ALREADY EXPENDED THREE THOUSAND AS TO FRANZ HE HAD NO LETTER OF CREDIT
COME IN YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID VAMPA THE COUNT AND FRANZ ASCENDED SEVEN OR EIGHT STEPS AFTER THE CHIEF WHO DREW BACK A BOLT AND OPENED A DOOR THEN BY THE GLEAM OF A LAMP SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH LIGHTED THE COLUMBARIUM ALBERT WAS TO BE SEEN WRAPPED UP IN A CLOAK
IT BE TO GO TO A BALL OUR FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF COUNTESS WHOM I LEFT IN PURSUIT OF HIS UNKNOWN ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS EVENING SAID FRANZ AND WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE AND DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS NOT AT ALL
WELL CONTINUED THE COUNT IN A TONE THAT MADE FRANZ SHUDDER THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN LODGES IN THE SAME HOTEL AS MYSELF THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN HAS BEEN UP AND DOWN THE CORSO FOR EIGHT HOURS IN MY PRIVATE CARRIAGE
WERE TO BE SEEN TWENTY BRIGANDS OR MORE EACH HAVING HIS CARBINE WITHIN REACH
REPLIED FRANZ I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT WORK YOU WERE PERUSING WITH SO MUCH ATTENTION AS WE ENTERED CAESAR'S COMMENTARIES SAID THE BANDIT
REPLIED ALBERT WITH PERFECT EASE OF MIND REMEMBER FOR THE FUTURE NAPOLEON'S MAXIM NEVER AWAKEN ME BUT FOR BAD NEWS IF YOU HAD LET ME SLEEP ON I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED MY GALOP AND HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL TO YOU ALL MY LIFE SO THEN
AND TO WHOM I DESIRED TO PROVE THAT LUIGI VAMPA WAS A MAN OF HIS WORD COME YOUR EXCELLENCY THE COUNT ADDED
RISE AND ANSWER PEPPINO GLANCED ANXIOUSLY AT FRANZ
THEY WENT ON A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PACES IN THIS WAY AND THEN WERE STOPPED BY WHO COMES THERE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SAW THE REFLECTION OF A TORCH ON A CARBINE BARREL A FRIEND RESPONDED PEPPINO AND ADVANCING ALONE TOWARDS THE SENTRY
REPLIED THE DUKE HERE I THINK IS ONE OF MY SERVANTS WHO IS SEEKING YOU THE DUKE WAS NOT MISTAKEN WHEN HE SAW FRANZ THE SERVANT CAME UP TO HIM YOUR EXCELLENCY HE SAID THE MASTER OF THE HOTEL DE LONDRES
YOU ARE RIGHT YOUR EXCELLENCY HE SAID THIS MUST BE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS
AND THOSE WHO ARE HERE WILL COMPLAIN OF BUT ONE THING ITS TOO RAPID FLIGHT I AM NOT SPEAKING SAID THE DUKE WITH A SMILE OF THE PERSONS WHO ARE HERE
EXCLAIMED FRANZ YES AND WHO IS THE MAN I DO NOT KNOW WHY DID HE NOT BRING IT TO ME HERE THE MESSENGER DID NOT SAY AND WHERE IS THE MESSENGER HE WENT AWAY DIRECTLY HE SAW ME ENTER THE BALL ROOM TO FIND YOU OH
SAID THE CAPTAIN THAT IS THE LEAST HONOR THAT I CAN RENDER TO YOUR EXCELLENCY AND TAKING THE LIGHTED TORCH FROM THE HANDS OF THE HERDSMAN HE PRECEDED HIS GUESTS NOT AS A SERVANT WHO PERFORMS AN ACT OF CIVILITY BUT LIKE A KING WHO PRECEDES AMBASSADORS ON REACHING THE DOOR
AT TORLONIA'S WITH THE COUNTESS G THEN HE DREW HIS WATCH FROM HIS POCKET THAT HE MIGHT SEE HOW TIME SPED HALF PAST ONE ONLY SAID HE WHY THE DEVIL DO YOU ROUSE ME AT THIS HOUR TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE FREE YOUR EXCELLENCY MY DEAR FELLOW
WHICH ONE OF THE BANDITS HAD LENT HIM LYING IN A CORNER IN PROFOUND SLUMBER COME SAID THE COUNT SMILING WITH HIS OWN PECULIAR SMILE NOT SO BAD FOR A MAN WHO IS TO BE SHOT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING VAMPA LOOKED AT ALBERT WITH A KIND OF ADMIRATION
AND THIS DIAMOND WAS GIVEN BY THE GENEROUS UNKNOWN TO MY SISTER AS HER DOWRY MONTE CRISTO OPENED THE LETTER AND READ IT WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF DELIGHT IT WAS THE LETTER WRITTEN AS OUR READERS KNOW TO JULIE AND SIGNED SINBAD THE SAILOR
THAT I CAUSE NO SMALL DISTURBANCE IN YOUR HOUSE LOOK THERE SAID MAXIMILIAN LAUGHING THERE IS HER HUSBAND CHANGING HIS JACKET FOR A COAT
AN ENGLISHMAN SAID MONTE CRISTO WHO GREW UNEASY AT THE ATTENTION WITH WHICH JULIE LOOKED AT HIM AN ENGLISHMAN YOU SAY YES REPLIED MAXIMILIAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO REPRESENTED HIMSELF AS THE CONFIDENTIAL CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH AT ROME
OH HEAVEN EXCLAIMED JULIE CLASPING HER HANDS IN WHAT DID HE BELIEVE THEN HE DID NOT CREDIT IT AT THE PERIOD WHICH I KNEW HIM SAID MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED TO THE HEART BY THE ACCENTS OF JULIE'S VOICE BUT PERHAPS SINCE THEN HE HAS HAD PROOFS THAT GRATITUDE DOES EXIST
HE HAD RESERVED THE HOUSE AND HALF THE GARDEN AND BUILDING A WALL BETWEEN THE GARDEN AND THE WORKSHOPS HAD LET THEM UPON LEASE WITH THE PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
FROM PRESUMING TO SULLY THE ARISTOCRATIC ENCLOSURE BELONGING TO THE MANSION THE GATE HAD BEEN BOARDED UP TO A HEIGHT OF SIX FEET TRUE THE PLANKS WERE NOT SO CLOSELY ADJUSTED BUT THAT A HASTY PEEP MIGHT BE OBTAINED THROUGH THEIR INTERSTICES
AS THEY WAVED THEIR VARIEGATED LEAVES IN THE WIND AND CHARMED THE EYE WITH THEIR SCARLET BLOOM HAD FALLEN INTO UTTER DISUSE THE PROPRIETORS OF THE MANSION HAD MANY YEARS BEFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THE POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE ITSELF
DEAREST VALENTINE SAID THE YOUNG MAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR RESPECTIVE STATIONS MAKES ME FEAR TO OFFEND YOU BY SPEAKING OF MY LOVE BUT YET I CANNOT FIND MYSELF IN YOUR PRESENCE WITHOUT LONGING TO POUR FORTH MY SOUL AND TELL YOU HOW FONDLY I ADORE YOU
HENCEFORTH WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR I AM ON MY OWN GROUND AND HAVE AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO PLACE A LADDER AGAINST THE WALL AND TO LOOK OVER WHEN I PLEASE WITHOUT HAVING ANY APPREHENSIONS OF BEING TAKEN OFF BY THE POLICE AS A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER
ALL OF THE RICHEST AND GLOSSIEST BLACK ILL ACCORDED WITH HIS PLEBEIAN ATTIRE AFTER CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS UNOBSERVED HE ENTERED BY THE SMALL GATE AND
WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN INCREASING BECAME ALARMING HE COULD NOT SPEAK
IT IS NEEDLESS TO ADD THAT THERE WERE GOLD AND SILVER FISH IN THE BASIN THE HOUSE WITH KITCHENS AND CELLARS BELOW HAD ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR TWO STORIES AND ATTICS
FOR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY YEARS THAT I HAVE THUS YIELDED TO MY FEELINGS AND HE HASTILY QUITTED THE APARTMENT THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO IS A STRANGE MAN SAID EMMANUEL YES ANSWERED MAXIMILIAN BUT I FEEL SURE HE HAS AN EXCELLENT HEART AND THAT HE LIKES US
BUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR HAS HAD A MYSTERIOUS MEANING THAT WE CANNOT COMPREHEND WE HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND A HAND AS POWERFUL AS THAT OF AN ENCHANTER OH CRIED JULIE I HAVE NOT LOST ALL HOPE OF SOME DAY KISSING THAT HAND AS I NOW KISS THE PURSE WHICH HE HAS TOUCHED
THAT COMPLETES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS WE HAD FIXED AS THE LIMITS OF OUR GAINS
WAS ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED IN THE CHOICE BY THE ABSENCE OF ALL GLARE THE COOL REFRESHING SHADE THE SCREEN IT AFFORDED FROM THE SCORCHING RAYS OF THE SUN THAT FOUND NO ENTRANCE THERE EVEN DURING THE BURNING DAYS OF HOTTEST SUMMER
HIS COAT CLOSELY BUTTONED UP AND CONSTANTLY TAKING OUT HIS PENCIL
AND THE YOUNG OFFICER SHOOK THE COUNT'S HAND SO WARMLY THAT MONTE CRISTO COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS TO THE SINCERITY OF HIS JOY AND HE SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED WITH IMPATIENCE AND WAS RECEIVED WITH PLEASURE
BUT CONTENTMENT IS SO NEW A SIGHT TO ME THAT I COULD NEVER BE WEARY OF LOOKING AT YOURSELF AND YOUR HUSBAND WE ARE VERY HAPPY MONSIEUR REPLIED JULIE BUT WE HAVE ALSO KNOWN UNHAPPINESS AND FEW HAVE EVER UNDERGONE MORE BITTER SUFFERINGS THAN OURSELVES
AGAIN THE TIMID GIRL FOUND COURAGE TO RETURN TO THE GATE SAYING AS SHE DID SO AND WHY DO YOU COME SO LATE TO DAY IT IS ALMOST DINNER TIME AND I HAD TO USE NO LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO GET RID OF MY WATCHFUL MOTHER IN LAW MY TOO DEVOTED MAID AND MY TROUBLESOME BROTHER
WHICH WAS FAINTLY DISCERNIBLE THROUGH THE DENSE MASS OF VERDURE THAT PARTIALLY CONCEALED IT THOUGH SITUATED BUT A HUNDRED PACES OFF WHOEVER HAD SELECTED THIS RETIRED PORTION OF THE GROUNDS AS THE BOUNDARY OF A WALK OR AS A PLACE FOR MEDITATION
DOOMED TO WANT AND WRETCHEDNESS CAN AT PRESENT HEAR EVERY ONE ENVYING OUR HAPPY LOT THIS LETTER AS HE SPOKE MAXIMILIAN DREW A LETTER FROM THE PURSE AND GAVE IT TO THE COUNT THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY HIM THE DAY THAT MY FATHER HAD TAKEN A DESPERATE RESOLUTION
MONTE CRISTO ROSE AND WITHOUT MAKING ANY ANSWER FOR THE TREMULOUSNESS OF HIS VOICE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIS EMOTION WALKED UP AND DOWN THE APARTMENT WITH A SLOW STEP OUR MAGNIFICENCE MAKES YOU SMILE COUNT SAID MAXIMILIAN WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES
CLAD IN A BLOUSE AND CAP A FAINT CRY OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SURPRISE ESCAPED FROM THE LIPS OF VALENTINE WHO ALMOST INSTANTLY SAID IN A SADDENED TONE AS THOUGH SOME ENVIOUS CLOUD DARKENED THE JOY WHICH ILLUMINED HER HEART
THERE IS NOTHING NOW TO PREVENT MY BUILDING MYSELF A LITTLE HUT ON MY PLANTATION AND RESIDING NOT TWENTY YARDS FROM YOU ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HAPPINESS THAT WOULD AFFORD ME I CAN SCARCELY CONTAIN MYSELF AT THE BARE IDEA
HE LABORED AND TOILED UNTIL HE HAD AMASSED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS SIX YEARS SUFFICED TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECT OH I ASSURE YOU SIR IT WAS A TOUCHING SPECTACLE TO SEE THESE YOUNG CREATURES DESTINED BY THEIR TALENTS FOR HIGHER STATIONS TOILING TOGETHER
LISTEN TO ME OUR HOUSE TRANSACTS BUSINESS TO THE AMOUNT OF A MILLION A YEAR FROM WHICH WE DERIVE AN INCOME OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS
IF LORD WILMORE WAS YOUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR I FEAR YOU WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN I PARTED FROM HIM TWO YEARS AGO AT PALERMO AND HE WAS THEN ON THE POINT OF SETTING OUT FOR THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS SO THAT I FEAR HE WILL NEVER RETURN
HOW CAN YOU FOR AN INSTANT ENTERTAIN SO UNWORTHY A THOUGHT DEAR VALENTINE HAVE I NOT FROM THE FIRST BLESSED HOUR OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE SCHOOLED ALL MY WORDS AND ACTIONS TO YOUR SENTIMENTS AND IDEAS
AND THAT YOUR FATHER WAS RESOLVED UPON COMPLETING THE MATCH
BUT THE EYE OF LOVE HAD ALREADY SEEN EVEN THROUGH THE NARROW CHINKS OF THE WOODEN PALISADES THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHITE ROBE AND OBSERVED THE FLUTTERING OF THE BLUE SASH PRESSING HIS LIPS CLOSE TO THE PLANKS HE EXCLAIMED DON'T BE ALARMED VALENTINE IT IS I
AND RECIPROCALLY AS THEY SAY AT THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL AT THE SOUND OF THEIR STEPS A YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY TO FIVE AND TWENTY DRESSED IN A SILK MORNING GOWN AND BUSILY ENGAGED IN PLUCKING THE DEAD LEAVES OFF A NOISETTE ROSE TREE RAISED HER HEAD
CAREFULLY CLOSING AND SECURING IT AFTER HIM PROCEEDED WITH A HURRIED STEP TOWARDS THE BARRIER AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE EXPECTED THOUGH PROBABLY NOT IN SUCH A COSTUME THE YOUNG WOMAN STARTED IN TERROR AND WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A HASTY RETREAT
CONSIDER BY BECOMING A GARDENER I EFFECTUALLY SCREEN OUR MEETINGS FROM ALL SUSPICION OR DANGER I BESEECH OF YOU MAXIMILIAN TO CEASE TRIFLING AND TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN SIMPLY
PENELON COUNT IS THE OLD SAILOR YOU SAW IN THE GARDEN AND WHO FROM QUARTERMASTER HAS BECOME GARDENER
SO I HAVE BECOME A GARDENER AND CONSEQUENTLY ADOPTED THE COSTUME OF MY CALLING WHAT EXCESSIVE NONSENSE YOU TALK MAXIMILIAN NONSENSE PRAY DO NOT CALL WHAT I CONSIDER THE WISEST ACTION OF MY LIFE BY SUCH A NAME
HE WAS MY FRIEND HE HAD NO SECRETS FROM ME AND IF THIS HAD BEEN SO HE WOULD HAVE CONFIDED IN ME AND HE TOLD YOU NOTHING NOT A WORD NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO SUPPOSE NOTHING AND YET YOU SPOKE OF HIM AT ONCE AH IN SUCH A CASE ONE SUPPOSES
NO NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO PALE AS DEATH PRESSING ONE HAND ON HIS HEART TO STILL ITS THROBBINGS WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE POINTED TO A CRYSTAL COVER BENEATH WHICH A SILKEN PURSE LAY ON A BLACK VELVET CUSHION
COME COME SAID MAXIMILIAN I WILL SERVE AS YOUR GUIDE SUCH A MAN AS YOU ARE OUGHT NOT TO BE INTRODUCED BY A SERVANT MY SISTER IS IN THE GARDEN PLUCKING THE DEAD ROSES MY BROTHER IS READING HIS TWO PAPERS THE PRESSE AND THE DEBATS WITHIN SIX STEPS OF HER
IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ME START WHEN YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY
UNKNOWN YOU SAY IS THE MAN WHO RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE UNKNOWN TO YOU YES WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE HAPPINESS OF PRESSING HIS HAND CONTINUED MAXIMILIAN WE HAVE SUPPLICATED HEAVEN IN VAIN TO GRANT US THIS FAVOR
I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE RUE MESLAY YOUR FAMILY APPEARS TO BE A VERY HAPPY ONE SAID THE COUNT AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF OH YES I ASSURE YOU COUNT THEY WANT NOTHING THAT CAN RENDER THEM HAPPY
BUT LISTEN TO ME VALENTINE AND I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT I BECAME WEARY OF RANGING FIELDS AND SCALING WALLS AND SERIOUSLY ALARMED AT THE IDEA SUGGESTED BY YOU THAT IF CAUGHT HOVERING ABOUT HERE YOUR FATHER WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE ME SENT TO PRISON AS A THIEF
IS IT NOT WORTH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS TO SAVE OUR FATHER'S NAME FROM THE CHANCES OF EVIL FORTUNE AND FAILURE
BUT SUCH AS WE ARE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BITTER SORROWS AND GOD HAS POURED BALM INTO YOUR WOUNDS AS HE DOES INTO THOSE OF ALL WHO ARE IN AFFLICTION SAID MONTE CRISTO INQUIRINGLY YES COUNT RETURNED JULIE WE MAY INDEED SAY HE HAS
THE HOUSE WAS OF WHITE STONE AND IN A SMALL COURT BEFORE IT WERE TWO SMALL BEDS FULL OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS
THE WHOLE OF THE PROPERTY CONSISTING OF AN IMMENSE WORKSHOP TWO PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN AND THE GARDEN ITSELF HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY EMMANUEL WHO HAD SEEN AT A GLANCE THAT HE COULD MAKE OF IT A PROFITABLE SPECULATION
BUT I WISHED TO HAVE YOUR ADVICE IS MY COUNSEL
THOSE BORN TO WEALTH AND WHO HAVE THE MEANS OF GRATIFYING EVERY WISH SAID EMMANUEL KNOW NOT WHAT IS THE REAL HAPPINESS OF LIFE JUST AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TOSSED ON THE STORMY WATERS OF THE OCEAN ON A FEW FRAIL PLANKS CAN ALONE REALIZE THE BLESSINGS OF FAIR WEATHER
MONTE CRISTO FELT TEARS START INTO HIS EYES AND HE AGAIN WALKED HASTILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN SAID MAXIMILIAN IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HIM TELL US WHAT IT IS ALAS CRIED MONTE CRISTO STRIVING TO REPRESS HIS EMOTION
MY FATHER THOUGHT THAT THIS ACTION HAD BEEN MIRACULOUSLY PERFORMED HE BELIEVED THAT A BENEFACTOR HAD ARISEN FROM THE GRAVE TO SAVE US OH IT WAS A TOUCHING SUPERSTITION MONSIEUR AND ALTHOUGH I DID NOT MYSELF BELIEVE IT I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD HAVE DESTROYED MY FATHER'S FAITH
THE COUNT'S FEATURES DISPLAYED AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST INTENSE CURIOSITY OH ALL THIS IS A FAMILY HISTORY AS CHATEAU RENAUD TOLD YOU THE OTHER DAY OBSERVED MAXIMILIAN
BUT CONTINUED SHE LORD WILMORE HAD A FAMILY OR FRIENDS HE MUST HAVE KNOWN SOME ONE CAN WE NOT OH IT IS USELESS TO INQUIRE RETURNED THE COUNT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE WAS NOT THE MAN YOU SEEK FOR
I HAVE CHOSEN A TRADE A TRADE OH MAXIMILIAN HOW CAN YOU JEST AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SUCH DEEP CAUSE FOR UNEASINESS HEAVEN KEEP ME FROM JESTING WITH THAT WHICH IS FAR DEARER TO ME THAN LIFE ITSELF
THAT WOULD COMPROMISE THE HONOR OF THE FRENCH ARMY TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT THE CONTINUAL PRESENCE OF A CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS IN A PLACE WHERE NO WARLIKE PROJECTS COULD BE SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR IT MIGHT WELL CREATE SURPRISE
AND THROUGH THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO CHANGE ANY OF THE CUSTOMS OF THEIR PATERNAL HOUSE TAKING SIX YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT LESS SCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EFFECTED IN TWO OR THREE MARSEILLES RESOUNDED WITH THEIR WELL EARNED PRAISES AT LAST ONE DAY EMMANUEL CAME TO HIS WIFE WHO HAD JUST FINISHED MAKING UP THE ACCOUNTS
NOT ONLY FOR HIS PAST OUTLAY BUT ALSO THE INTEREST UPON THE CAPITAL LOCKED UP IN HIS NEW ACQUISITION CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH LETTING THE GROUND TEMPORARILY TO SOME MARKET GARDENERS AT A YEARLY RENTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
AND IN THE REAR OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPOSING MANSIONS IN THIS RICH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE VARIOUS HOUSES VIE WITH EACH OTHER FOR ELEGANCE OF DESIGN AND MAGNIFICENCE OF CONSTRUCTION EXTENDED A LARGE GARDEN
WHO IS ALWAYS TEASING ME ABOUT COMING TO WORK AT MY EMBROIDERY WHICH I AM IN A FAIR WAY NEVER TO GET DONE SO PRAY EXCUSE YOURSELF AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR HAVING MADE ME WAIT AND AFTER THAT TELL ME WHY I SEE YOU IN A DRESS SO SINGULAR THAT AT FIRST I DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU
INTO THE LARGE STONE VASES THAT STOOD UPON THE TWO SQUARE PILASTERS OF A CURIOUSLY WROUGHT IRON GATE
EVERYTHING IN THIS CHARMING RETREAT FROM THE WARBLE OF THE BIRDS TO THE SMILE OF THE MISTRESS BREATHED TRANQUILLITY AND REPOSE THE COUNT HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THIS HAPPINESS FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND HE REMAINED SILENT AND PENSIVE
WITH A TONE SO SWEET AND GENTLE THAT IT WENT TO MAXIMILIAN'S HEART LIKE THE VOICE OF A FATHER BUT THEY WILL NOT BE CONTENT WITH THAT YOUR BROTHER IN LAW IS A BARRISTER A DOCTOR HE WAS A MERCHANT MONSIEUR AND HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE BUSINESS OF MY POOR FATHER
AND WHERE CABBAGES CARROTS RADISHES PEASE AND MELONS HAD ONCE FLOURISHED A SCANTY CROP OF LUCERNE ALONE BORE EVIDENCE OF ITS BEING DEEMED WORTHY OF CULTIVATION
NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO I ONLY GUESSED I KNEW A LORD WILMORE WHO WAS CONSTANTLY DOING ACTIONS OF THIS KIND WITHOUT REVEALING HIMSELF HE WAS AN ECCENTRIC BEING AND DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF GRATITUDE
HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE A LARGE VASE OF JAPAN PORCELAIN FILLED WITH FLOWERS THAT LOADED THE AIR WITH THEIR PERFUME STOOD IN THE SALON JULIE SUITABLY DRESSED AND HER HAIR ARRANGED SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS FEAT IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES RECEIVED THE COUNT ON HIS ENTRANCE
A SMALL LOW DOOR GAVE EGRESS FROM THE WALLED SPACE WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING INTO THE PROJECTED STREET THE GROUND HAVING BEEN ABANDONED AS UNPRODUCTIVE BY ITS VARIOUS RENTERS
THIS WAS JULIE WHO HAD BECOME AS THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAD PREDICTED MADAME EMMANUEL HERBAULT SHE UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER AND MAXIMILIAN BEGAN TO LAUGH
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO STOP THE ISSUE OF ANY MORE AND CLOSE OUR OFFICE THIS WAS DONE INSTANTLY IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AT A QUARTER PAST A MERCHANT PRESENTED HIMSELF TO INSURE TWO SHIPS IT WAS A CLEAR PROFIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY AFFECTING THE GROWTH OF OTHER LUXURIANT SHRUBS AND FLOWERS THAT EAGERLY DRESSED FORWARD TO FILL UP THE VACANT SPACES AS THOUGH ASSERTING THEIR RIGHT TO ENJOY THE BOON OF LIGHT AND AIR AT ONE CORNER
BUT THE STRICT DECORUM AND RIGID PROPRIETY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE LEFT NO GROUNDS FOR APPREHENDING THAT ADVANTAGE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HORTICULTURE SEEMED HOWEVER TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED IN THE DESERTED KITCHEN GARDEN
IT OCCURRED TO THE POSSESSOR OF THE PROPERTY THAT A HANDSOME SUM MIGHT BE OBTAINED FOR THE GROUND THEN DEVOTED TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY BUILDING ALONG THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED STREET AND SO MAKING IT A BRANCH OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE ITSELF
OH WOULD WE COULD RELATE IT EVERYWHERE AND TO EVERY ONE SO THAT THE EMOTION OF OUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR MIGHT REVEAL HIS PRESENCE
FORGETTING THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO RENEW THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD CEASED AFTER THE FIRST SALUTATIONS HAD BEEN EXCHANGED THE SILENCE BECAME ALMOST PAINFUL WHEN BY A VIOLENT EFFORT TEARING HIMSELF FROM HIS PLEASING REVERIE
THE CARRIAGES THAT DROVE UP TO THE DOOR WERE COMPELLED TO TURN TO AVOID A FOUNTAIN THAT PLAYED IN A BASIN OF ROCKWORK AN ORNAMENT THAT HAD EXCITED THE JEALOUSY OF THE WHOLE QUARTER
THE INCESSANT AND MELODIOUS WARBLING OF BIRDS AND THE ENTIRE REMOVAL FROM EITHER THE NOISE OF THE STREET OR THE BUSTLE OF THE MANSION ON THE EVENING OF ONE OF THE WARMEST DAYS SPRING HAD YET BESTOWED ON THE INHABITANTS OF PARIS
AND SO AS WE HAVE SAID THE IRON GATE LEADING INTO THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAD BEEN CLOSED UP AND LEFT TO THE RUST WHICH BADE FAIR BEFORE LONG TO EAT OFF ITS HINGES WHILE TO PREVENT THE IGNOBLE GLANCES OF THE DIGGERS AND DELVERS OF THE GROUND
DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF JULIE SAID HE THE COUNT HAS ONLY BEEN TWO OR THREE DAYS IN PARIS BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS WHAT A FASHIONABLE WOMAN OF THE MARAIS IS AND IF HE DOES NOT YOU WILL SHOW HIM
ENDEAVORING TO DISCERN SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE BY MEANS OF THE OPENINGS IN THE PLANKS THE EARNESTNESS OF HER ATTITUDE AND THE FIXED GAZE WITH WHICH SHE SEEMED TO SEEK THE OBJECT OF HER WISHES PROVING HOW MUCH HER FEELINGS WERE INTERESTED IN THE MATTER
AND MONSIEUR MAXIMILIAN MORREL WOULD SEE HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO CRIED MORREL THROWING AWAY HIS CIGAR AND HASTENING TO THE CARRIAGE I SHOULD THINK WE WOULD SEE HIM AH A THOUSAND THANKS COUNT FOR NOT HAVING FORGOTTEN YOUR PROMISE
I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD BE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PURSE WITH THE PAPER AT ONE END AND THE LARGE DIAMOND AT THE OTHER COUNT REPLIED MAXIMILIAN WITH AN AIR OF GRAVITY THOSE ARE OUR MOST PRECIOUS FAMILY TREASURES THE STONE SEEMS VERY BRILLIANT ANSWERED THE COUNT
WHICH IS EVIDENTLY NOT HIS REAL NAME BUT A FICTITIOUS ONE THEN NOTICING THAT JULIE WAS STRUCK WITH THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TELL ME CONTINUED HE WAS HE NOT ABOUT MY HEIGHT PERHAPS A LITTLE TALLER WITH HIS CHIN IMPRISONED AS IT WERE IN A HIGH CRAVAT
FOR HE HAS DONE FOR US WHAT HE GRANTS ONLY TO HIS CHOSEN HE SENT US ONE OF HIS ANGELS
IN WHICH HE OFFERS TO PURCHASE THE GOOD WILL OF THE HOUSE TO UNITE WITH HIS OWN FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ADVISE ME WHAT I HAD BETTER DO
SAW ON THE QUAY AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS ON THE POINT OF EMBARKING ON BOARD A YACHT AND HE RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE PERSON WHO CALLED ON MY FATHER THE FIFTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE AND WHO WROTE ME THIS LETTER ON THE FIFTH OF SEPTEMBER HE FELT CONVINCED OF HIS IDENTITY BUT HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ADDRESS HIM
MAXIMILIAN HAD SCARCELY FINISHED HIS STORY DURING WHICH THE COUNT'S HEART HAD SWELLED WITHIN HIM WHEN EMMANUEL ENTERED WEARING A HAT AND COAT HE SALUTED THE COUNT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS AWARE OF THE RANK OF HIS GUEST THEN AFTER HAVING LED MONTE CRISTO AROUND THE LITTLE GARDEN
WITH ITS THICKLY PLANTED COURT YARD OPENING INTO THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE AND TO THE GARDEN SHUT IN BY THIS GATE WHICH FORMERLY COMMUNICATED WITH A FINE KITCHEN GARDEN OF ABOUT AN ACRE FOR THE DEMON OF SPECULATION DREW A LINE
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THOROUGHFARES IN THE CITY OF PARIS IN MATTERS OF SPECULATION HOWEVER THOUGH MAN PROPOSES MONEY DISPOSES FROM SOME SUCH DIFFICULTY THE NEWLY NAMED STREET DIED ALMOST IN BIRTH
SUCH FELICITY SEEMS ABOVE ALL PRICE AS A THING IMPOSSIBLE AND UNATTAINABLE BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I PURCHASE ALL THIS DELIGHT JOY AND HAPPINESS
WHERE THE FOLIAGE BECAME SO THICK AS ALMOST TO SHUT OUT DAY A LARGE STONE BENCH AND SUNDRY RUSTIC SEATS INDICATED THAT THIS SHELTERED SPOT WAS EITHER IN GENERAL FAVOR OR PARTICULAR USE BY SOME INHABITANT OF THE HOUSE
THEY ARE YOUNG AND CHEERFUL THEY ARE TENDERLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER AND WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR THEY FANCY THEMSELVES AS RICH AS ROTHSCHILD FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS IS NOT A LARGE SUM HOWEVER REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
OR IN OTHER WORDS PROJECTED A STREET AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN THE STREET WAS LAID OUT A NAME WAS CHOSEN AND POSTED UP ON AN IRON PLATE BUT BEFORE CONSTRUCTION WAS BEGUN
PARDON ME I HAD NO INTENTION OF COMMITTING AN INDISCRETION INDISCRETION OH YOU MAKE US HAPPY BY GIVING US AN EXCUSE FOR EXPATIATING ON THIS SUBJECT IF WE WANTED TO CONCEAL THE NOBLE ACTION THIS PURSE COMMEMORATES WE SHOULD NOT EXPOSE IT THUS TO VIEW
AND WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN HAS TAKEN THIS METHOD OF REQUITING THE OBLIGATION EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN THIS AFFAIR EVEN A MIRACLE WHAT WAS HIS NAME ASKED MONTE CRISTO HE GAVE NO OTHER NAME ANSWERED JULIE LOOKING EARNESTLY AT THE COUNT
AND THE PURCHASER OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAVING PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR IT AND BEING QUITE UNABLE TO FIND ANY ONE WILLING TO TAKE HIS BARGAIN OFF HIS HANDS WITHOUT A CONSIDERABLE LOSS YET STILL CLINGING TO THE BELIEF THAT AT SOME FUTURE DAY HE SHOULD OBTAIN A SUM FOR IT THAT WOULD REPAY HIM
HE MEANS THAT THE ARTICLES CONTAINED IN THIS PURSE ARE THE RELICS OF THE ANGEL I SPOKE OF JUST NOW THIS I DO NOT COMPREHEND AND YET I MAY NOT ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BOWING
AND HAD NOW FALLEN SO COMPLETELY IN GENERAL ESTIMATION AS TO RETURN NOT EVEN THE ONE HALF PER CENT IT HAD ORIGINALLY PAID TOWARDS THE HOUSE THE CHESTNUT TREES WE HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED ROSE HIGH ABOVE THE WALL
LEFT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN MY SISTER AND MYSELF FOR WE WERE HIS ONLY CHILDREN HER HUSBAND WHO WHEN HE MARRIED HER HAD NO OTHER PATRIMONY THAN HIS NOBLE PROBITY HIS FIRST RATE ABILITY AND HIS SPOTLESS REPUTATION WISHED TO POSSESS AS MUCH AS HIS WIFE
AND YOU HAVE I AM SURE THE FULLEST CONFIDENCE IN MY HONOR WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME OF EXPERIENCING A VAGUE AND INDEFINITE SENSE OF COMING DANGER I PLACED MYSELF BLINDLY AND DEVOTEDLY AT YOUR SERVICE ASKING NO OTHER REWARD THAN THE PLEASURE OF BEING USEFUL TO YOU
MADEMOISELLE JULIE SAID HE PENELON HAD STILL PRESERVED THE HABIT OF CALLING HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER MADEMOISELLE JULIE AND HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THE NAME TO MADAME HERBAULT
BUT AS HE HAD BUT ONE EYE AND THAT EYE HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT DIM IN THE COURSE OF NINE YEARS
HAD LORD WILMORE SEEN WHAT I NOW SEE HE WOULD BECOME ATTACHED TO LIFE FOR THE TEARS YOU SHED WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO MANKIND AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO JULIE WHO GAVE HIM HERS CARRIED AWAY BY THE LOOK AND ACCENT OF THE COUNT
AT LEAST I WAS IN YOUR THOUGHTS YOU ASKED ME THE CAUSE OF MY BEING LATE AND WHY I COME DISGUISED I WILL CANDIDLY EXPLAIN THE REASON OF BOTH
SAID A FEW HURRIED WORDS TO MADAME HERBAULT AND PRESSING THE HANDS OF EMMANUEL AND MAXIMILIAN MADAME SAID HE I TRUST YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO VISIT YOU OCCASIONALLY I VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND FEEL GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR WELCOME
FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL ME DID YOU KNOW THIS ENGLISHMAN BUT YOU TELL ME ALSO THAT THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAVE CONSTANTLY DENIED HAVING RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE YES THEN IS IT NOT PROBABLE THAT THIS ENGLISHMAN MAY BE SOME ONE WHO GRATEFUL FOR A KINDNESS YOUR FATHER HAD SHOWN HIM
WHERE THE WIDE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREES RAISED THEIR HEADS HIGH ABOVE THE WALLS IN A SOLID RAMPART AND WITH THE COMING OF EVERY SPRING SCATTERED A SHOWER OF DELICATE PINK AND WHITE BLOSSOMS
OH MONSIEUR THIS IS CRUEL OF YOU SAID JULIE MUCH AFFECTED AND THE YOUNG LADY'S EYES SWAM WITH TEARS MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO GRAVELY AND GAZING EARNESTLY ON THE TWO LIQUID PEARLS THAT TRICKLED DOWN JULIE'S CHEEKS
WHERE HE RECEIVED HIS FRIENDS HE WAS SUPERINTENDING THE GROOMING OF HIS HORSE AND SMOKING HIS CIGAR AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GARDEN WHEN THE COUNT'S CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE GATE
AT THAT INSTANT THE LITTLE SIDE GATE LEADING FROM THE WASTE GROUND TO THE STREET WAS NOISELESSLY OPENED AND A TALL POWERFUL YOUNG MAN APPEARED HE WAS DRESSED IN A COMMON GRAY BLOUSE AND VELVET CAP BUT HIS CAREFULLY ARRANGED HAIR BEARD AND MUSTACHE
A FRIEND LOST TO HIM FOREVER AND ON HIS DEATH BED WHEN THE NEAR APPROACH OF ETERNITY SEEMED TO HAVE ILLUMINED HIS MIND WITH SUPERNATURAL LIGHT THIS THOUGHT WHICH HAD UNTIL THEN BEEN BUT A DOUBT BECAME A CONVICTION AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE MAXIMILIAN IT WAS EDMOND DANTES
IF IT BE BUT TO CARRY AWAY WITH ME THE RECOLLECTION OF SUCH SWEET MOMENTS I COULD EVEN THANK YOU FOR CHIDING ME FOR IT LEAVES ME A GLEAM OF HOPE THAT IF YOU DID NOT EXPECT ME AND THAT INDEED WOULD BE WORSE THAN VANITY TO SUPPOSE
A FEW LOCKS OF GRAY MINGLED WITH HIS HAIR WHICH WAS STILL THICK AND MATTED WHILE HIS BRONZED FEATURES AND DETERMINED GLANCE WELL SUITED AN OLD SAILOR WHO HAD BRAVED THE HEAT OF THE EQUATOR AND THE STORMS OF THE TROPICS I THINK YOU HAILED ME
MIGHT BE SEEN NEGLIGENTLY THROWN UPON THE STONE BENCH A BOOK A PARASOL AND A WORK BASKET FROM WHICH HUNG A PARTLY EMBROIDERED CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF WHILE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THESE ARTICLES WAS A YOUNG WOMAN STANDING CLOSE TO THE IRON GATE
THERE WAS A STUDY FOR EMMANUEL WHO NEVER STUDIED AND A MUSIC ROOM FOR JULIE WHO NEVER PLAYED THE WHOLE OF THE SECOND STORY WAS SET APART FOR MAXIMILIAN IT WAS PRECISELY SIMILAR TO HIS SISTER'S APARTMENTS EXCEPT THAT FOR THE BREAKFAST PARLOR HE HAD A BILLIARD ROOM
RECOLLECT WHAT OUR EXCELLENT FATHER SO OFTEN TOLD US IT WAS NO ENGLISHMAN THAT THUS SAVED US MONTE CRISTO STARTED
ALAS NO MAXIMILIAN THIS MUST NOT BE FOR MANY REASONS WE SHOULD PRESUME TOO MUCH ON OUR OWN STRENGTH AND LIKE OTHERS PERHAPS BE LED ASTRAY BY OUR BLIND CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER'S PRUDENCE
I KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND AS YOU WISHED AND WAITED NOT FOR THE DECISION OF YOUR HEART OR MY OWN
MONSIEUR RETURNED MAXIMILIAN RAISING THE GLASS COVER AND RESPECTFULLY KISSING THE SILKEN PURSE THIS HAS TOUCHED THE HAND OF A MAN WHO SAVED MY FATHER FROM SUICIDE US FROM RUIN AND OUR NAME FROM SHAME AND DISGRACE A MAN BY WHOSE MATCHLESS BENEVOLENCE WE POOR CHILDREN
AND DO YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN MONSIEUR INQUIRED EMMANUEL OH IF YOU DO KNOW HIM CRIED JULIE CAN YOU TELL US WHERE HE IS WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM MAXIMILIAN EMMANUEL IF WE DO BUT DISCOVER HIM HE MUST BELIEVE IN THE GRATITUDE OF THE HEART
AND RAVING GOES THUS HARRYING OTHER PEOPLE O SAID I TO HIM SO MAY NOT THE OTHER SET TEETH ON THEE LET IT NOT WEARY THEE TO TELL US WHO IT IS ERE IT DART HENCE
THUS DID WE SPEAK AS FAR AS THE FIRST PLACE UPON THE CRAG WHICH THE NEXT VALLEY SHOWS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM IF THERE WERE MORE LIGHT WHEN WE WERE NOW RIGHT OVER THE LAST CLOISTER OF MALEBOLGE SO THAT ITS LAY BROTHERS COULD MANIFEST THEMSELVES UNTO OUR SIGHT
TO BE EXPERIENCED OF THE WORLD AND OF THE VICE AND VIRTUE OF MANKIND BUT I PUT FORTH ON THE HIGH OPEN SEA WITH ONE SOLE SHIP AND THAT SMALL COMPANY BY WHICH I NEVER HAD DESERTED BEEN
AND PENITENT AND CONFESSING I SURRENDERED AH WOE IS ME AND IT WOULD HAVE BESTEAD ME
THAN WAS IT TO BEHOLD THROUGH THAT DARK VALLEY THE SPIRITS LANGUISHING IN DIVERS HEAPS THIS ON THE BELLY THAT UPON THE BACK ONE OF THE OTHER LAY AND OTHERS CRAWLING SHIFTED THEMSELVES ALONG THE DISMAL ROAD
NOR IN ME THAT CORD WHICH USED TO MAKE THOSE GIRT WITH IT MORE MEAGRE BUT EVEN AS CONSTANTINE SOUGHT OUT SYLVESTER TO CURE HIS LEPROSY WITHIN SORACTE SO THIS ONE SOUGHT ME OUT AS AN ADEPT
AS THE SICILIAN BULL THAT BELLOWED FIRST WITH THE LAMENT OF HIM AND THAT WAS RIGHT WHO WITH HIS FILE HAD MODULATED IT BELLOWED SO WITH THE VOICE OF THE AFFLICTED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS MADE OF BRASS
THIS IS HE AND HE SPEAKS NOT THIS ONE BEING BANISHED EVERY DOUBT SUBMERGED IN CAESAR BY AFFIRMING THE FOREARMED ALWAYS WITH DETRIMENT ALLOWED DELAY
IF I DESERVED OF YOU OR MUCH OR LITTLE WHEN IN THE WORLD I WROTE THE LOFTY VERSES DO NOT MOVE ON BUT ONE OF YOU DECLARE WHITHER BEING LOST HE WENT AWAY TO DIE THEN OF THE ANTIQUE FLAME THE GREATER HORN MURMURING
I HAD WHILE LIVING MUCH OF WHAT I WISHED AND NOW ALAS A DROP OF WATER CRAVE
SO MAY THY NAILS SUFFICE THEE TO ALL ETERNITY UNTO THIS WORK LATIANS ARE WE WHOM THOU SO WASTED SEEST BOTH OF US HERE ONE WEEPING MADE REPLY BUT WHO ART THOU THAT QUESTIONEST ABOUT US AND SAID THE GUIDE
AND VESTED THUS IN GOING I BEMOAN ME
AND ALL THE REST WHOSE BONES ARE GATHERED STILL AT CEPERANO WHERE A RENEGADE WAS EACH APULIAN AND AT TAGLIACOZZO WHERE WITHOUT ARMS THE OLD ALARDO CONQUERED AND ONE HIS LIMB TRANSPIERCED AND ONE LOPPED OFF
AS I GREW AWARE AS SOON AS I WAS WHERE THE DEPTH APPEARED AND SUCH AS HE WHO WITH THE BEARS AVENGED HIM BEHELD ELIJAH'S CHARIOT AT DEPARTING WHAT TIME THE STEEDS TO HEAVEN ERECT UPROSE
AND THREATENING WITH HIS FINGER FIERCELY AND HEARD HIM CALLED GERI DEL BELLO SO WHOLLY AT THAT TIME WAST THOU IMPEDED BY HIM WHO FORMERLY HELD ALTAFORTE THOU DIDST NOT LOOK THAT WAY
DIVERS LAMENTINGS PIERCED ME THROUGH AND THROUGH WHICH WITH COMPASSION HAD THEIR ARROWS BARBED WHEREAT MINE EARS I COVERED WITH MY HANDS WHAT PAIN WOULD BE IF FROM THE HOSPITALS OF VALDICHIANA
O BROTHERS WHO AMID A HUNDRED THOUSAND PERILS I SAID HAVE COME UNTO THE WEST TO THIS SO INCONSIDERABLE VIGIL WHICH IS REMAINING OF YOUR SENSES
THEN URGED ME ON HIS WEIGHTY ARGUMENTS THERE WHERE MY SILENCE WAS THE WORST ADVICE AND SAID I FATHER SINCE THOU WASHEST ME OF THAT SIN INTO WHICH I NOW MUST FALL
STILL BE YE UNWILLING TO DENY THE KNOWLEDGE FOLLOWING THE SUN OF THE UNPEOPLED WORLD CONSIDER YE THE SEED FROM WHICH YE SPRANG YE WERE NOT MADE TO LIVE LIKE UNTO BRUTES
OR EVER YET AENEAS NAMED IT SO NOR FONDNESS FOR MY SON NOR REVERENCE FOR MY OLD FATHER NOR THE DUE AFFECTION WHICH JOYOUS SHOULD HAVE MADE PENELOPE COULD OVERCOME WITHIN ME THE DESIRE I HAD
AND BY THE HAIR IT HELD THE HEAD DISSEVERED HUNG FROM THE HAND IN FASHION OF A LANTERN AND THAT UPON US GAZED AND SAID O ME IT OF ITSELF MADE TO ITSELF A LAMP
O HOW BEWILDERED UNTO ME APPEARED WITH TONGUE ASUNDER IN HIS WINDPIPE SLIT CURIO WHO IN SPEAKING WAS SO BOLD AND ONE WHO BOTH HIS HANDS DISSEVERED HAD
BITING IN THE MANNER RAN ALONG THAT A BOAR DOES WHEN FROM THE STY TURNED LOOSE ONE TO CAPOCCHIO CAME AND BY THE NAPE SEIZED WITH ITS TEETH HIS NECK
WITH THE OTHER BURTHEN DROWNED HERSELF AND AT THE TIME WHEN FORTUNE DOWNWARD HURLED THE TROJAN'S ARROGANCE THAT ALL THINGS DARED SO THAT THE KING WAS WITH HIS KINGDOM CRUSHED HECUBA SAD DISCONSOLATE AND CAPTIVE
BOTH OF THE SHORES I SAW AS FAR AS SPAIN FAR AS MOROCCO AND THE ISLE OF SARDES AND THE OTHERS WHICH THAT SEA BATHES ROUND ABOUT I AND MY COMPANY WERE OLD AND SLOW
BY REASON OF OUR SPEECH AND MEMORY THAT HAVE SMALL ROOM TO COMPREHEND SO MUCH IF WERE AGAIN ASSEMBLED ALL THE PEOPLE WHICH FORMERLY UPON THE FATEFUL LAND OF PUGLIA
JOYFUL WERE WE AND SOON IT TURNED TO WEEPING FOR OUT OF THE NEW LAND A WHIRLWIND ROSE AND SMOTE UPON THE FORE PART OF THE SHIP
THE STUMPS UPLIFTING THROUGH THE MURKY AIR SO THAT THE BLOOD MADE HORRIBLE HIS FACE CRIED OUT THOU SHALT REMEMBER MOSCA ALSO WHO SAID ALAS A THING DONE HAS AN END WHICH WAS AN ILL SEED FOR THE TUSCAN PEOPLE
WHEN LIFELESS SHE BEHELD POLYXENA AND OF HER POLYDORUS ON THE SHORE OF OCEAN WAS THE DOLOROUS ONE AWARE OUT OF HER SENSES LIKE A DOG SHE BARKED SO MUCH THE ANGUISH HAD HER MIND DISTORTED
WE STEP BY STEP WENT ONWARD WITHOUT SPEECH GAZING UPON AND LISTENING TO THE SICK WHO HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIFT THEIR BODIES I SAW TWO SITTING LEANED AGAINST EACH OTHER AS LEANS IN HEATING PLATTER AGAINST PLATTER
AND PAIN FOR THE PALLADIUM THERE IS BORNE IF THEY WITHIN THOSE SPARKS POSSESS THE POWER TO SPEAK I SAID THEE MASTER MUCH I PRAY AND RE PRAY THAT THE PRAYER BE WORTH A THOUSAND
FOR THEM AM I IN SUCH A FAMILY THEY DID INDUCE ME INTO COINING FLORINS WHICH HAD THREE CARATS OF IMPURITY AND I TO HIM WHO ARE THE TWO POOR WRETCHES THAT SMOKE LIKE UNTO A WET HAND IN WINTER
BEHOLD IF ANY BE AS GREAT AS THIS AND SO THAT THOU MAY CARRY NEWS OF ME
EVER BEFORE ME STAND AND NOT IN VAIN FOR FAR MORE DOTH THEIR IMAGE DRY ME UP THAN THE DISEASE WHICH STRIPS MY FACE OF FLESH THE RIGID JUSTICE THAT CHASTISES ME DRAWETH OCCASION FROM THE PLACE IN WHICH I SINNED
WHERE THE MINISTRESS OF THE HIGH LORD JUSTICE INFALLIBLE PUNISHES FORGERS WHICH SHE HERE RECORDS I DO NOT THINK A SADDER SIGHT TO SEE WAS IN AEGINA THE WHOLE PEOPLE SICK
FOR I WAS FROM THE MOUNTAINS THERE BETWEEN URBINO AND THE YOKE WHENCE TIBER BURSTS I STILL WAS DOWNWARD BENT AND LISTENING WHEN MY CONDUCTOR TOUCHED ME ON THE SIDE SAYING SPEAK THOU
AND THEY WERE TWO IN ONE AND ONE IN TWO
AND MASTER ADAM SMOTE HIM IN THE FACE WITH ARM THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BE LESS HARD SAYING TO HIM ALTHOUGH BE TAKEN FROM ME ALL MOTION FOR MY LIMBS THAT HEAVY ARE I HAVE AN ARM UNFETTERED FOR SUCH NEED WHEREAT HE ANSWER MADE
AND THOU INSTRUCT ME HOW TO RAZE PALESTRINA TO THE GROUND HEAVEN HAVE I POWER TO LOCK AND TO UNLOCK AS THOU DOST KNOW THEREFORE THE KEYS ARE TWO THE WHICH MY PREDECESSOR HELD NOT DEAR
AND I WHO HAD BEFOREHAND MY REPLY IN READINESS FORTHWITH BEGAN TO SPEAK O SOUL THAT DOWN BELOW THERE ART CONCEALED ROMAGNA THINE IS NOT AND NEVER HAS BEEN WITHOUT WAR IN THE BOSOM OF ITS TYRANTS
AND WHERE HIS WIT THE ABBAGLIATO PROFFERED BUT THAT THOU KNOW WHO THUS DOTH SECOND THEE AGAINST THE SIENESE MAKE SHARP THINE EYE TOW'RDS ME SO THAT MY FACE WELL ANSWER THEE
AND ALBERT OF SIENA HAD ME BURNED BUT WHAT I DIED FOR DOES NOT BRING ME HERE TIS TRUE I SAID TO HIM SPEAKING IN JEST THAT I COULD RISE BY FLIGHT INTO THE AIR AND HE WHO HAD CONCEIT BUT LITTLE WIT WOULD HAVE ME SHOW TO HIM THE ART AND ONLY BECAUSE NO DAEDALUS I MADE HIM
WHEN IT WAS COME CLOSE TO THE BRIDGE'S FOOT IT LIFTED HIGH ITS ARM WITH ALL THE HEAD TO BRING MORE CLOSELY UNTO US ITS WORDS WHICH WERE BEHOLD NOW THE SORE PENALTY
TO PUT THE MORE MY SIGHS IN FLIGHT THERE IS ROMENA WHERE I COUNTERFEITED THE CURRENCY IMPRINTED WITH THE BAPTIST FOR WHICH I LEFT MY BODY BURNED ABOVE
THE CITIES OF LAMONE AND SANTERNO GOVERNS THE LIONCEL OF THE WHITE LAIR WHO CHANGES SIDES TWIXT SUMMER TIME AND WINTER AND THAT OF WHICH THE SAVIO BATHES THE FLANK EVEN AS IT LIES BETWEEN THE PLAIN AND MOUNTAIN
BY REASON THAT OUR WOUNDS ARE CLOSED AGAIN ERE ANY ONE IN FRONT OF HIM REPASS BUT WHO ART THOU THAT MUSEST ON THE CRAG PERCHANCE TO POSTPONE GOING TO THE PAIN THAT IS ADJUDGED UPON THINE ACCUSATIONS
HAS ME CONDEMNED AND TO THE POET SAID I NOW WAS EVER SO VAIN A PEOPLE AS THE SIENESE NOT FOR A CERTAINTY THE FRENCH BY FAR WHEREAT THE OTHER LEPER WHO HAD HEARD ME REPLIED UNTO MY SPEECH
AGAINST THE THEBAN BLOOD AS SHE ALREADY MORE THAN ONCE HAD SHOWN SO REFT OF REASON ATHAMAS BECAME THAT SEEING HIS OWN WIFE WITH CHILDREN TWAIN WALKING ENCUMBERED UPON EITHER HAND HE CRIED
I TURNED IT BACK TO LOOK UPON THE OTHER EVIL BORN I SAW ONE MADE IN FASHION OF A LUTE IF HE HAD ONLY HAD THE GROIN CUT OFF JUST AT THE POINT AT WHICH A MAN IS FORKED THE HEAVY DROPSY
NOW GO THY WAY NO MORE I URGE THEE BECAUSE I COME PERCHANCE A LITTLE LATE TO STAY AND SPEAK WITH ME LET IT NOT IRK THEE THOU SEEST IT IRKS NOT ME AND I AM BURNING
HE MUST COME DOWN AMONG MY SERVITORS BECAUSE HE GAVE THE FRAUDULENT ADVICE FROM WHICH TIME FORTH I HAVE BEEN AT HIS HAIR FOR WHO REPENTS NOT CANNOT BE ABSOLVED NOR CAN ONE BOTH REPENT AND WILL AT ONCE
AND HE TO ME THAT IS THE ANCIENT GHOST OF THE NEFARIOUS MYRRHA WHO BECAME BEYOND ALL RIGHTFUL LOVE HER FATHER'S LOVER SHE CAME TO SIN WITH HIM AFTER THIS MANNER BY COUNTERFEITING OF ANOTHER'S FORM
WERE LAMENTING FOR THEIR BLOOD SHED BY THE ROMANS AND THE LINGERING WAR THAT OF THE RINGS MADE SUCH ILLUSTRIOUS SPOILS AS LIVY HAS RECORDED WHO ERRS NOT
WHOLLY TO ME DID THE GOOD MASTER GATHER SAYING SAY UNTO THEM WHATE'ER THOU WISHEST AND I BEGAN SINCE HE WOULD HAVE IT SO SO MAY YOUR MEMORY NOT STEAL AWAY IN THE FIRST WORLD FROM OUT THE MINDS OF MEN
AS HE WHO GOETH YONDER UNDERTOOK THAT HE MIGHT GAIN THE LADY OF THE HERD TO COUNTERFEIT IN HIMSELF BUOSO DONATI MAKING A WILL AND GIVING IT DUE FORM AND AFTER THE TWO MANIACS HAD PASSED ON WHOM I HELD MINE EYE
ONE AM I WHO DESCENDS DOWN WITH THIS LIVING MAN FROM CLIFF TO CLIFF AND I INTEND TO SHOW HELL UNTO HIM THEN BROKEN WAS THEIR MUTUAL SUPPORT AND TREMBLING EACH ONE TURNED HIMSELF TO ME WITH OTHERS WHO HAD HEARD HIM BY REBOUND
WHENCE HE ACCUMULATING WOE ON WOE DEPARTED LIKE A PERSON SAD AND CRAZED BUT I REMAINED TO LOOK UPON THE CROWD AND SAW A THING WHICH I SHOULD BE AFRAID WITHOUT SOME FURTHER PROOF EVEN TO RECOUNT
NEPTUNE NE'ER YET BEHELD SO GREAT A CRIME NEITHER OF PIRATES NOR ARGOLIC PEOPLE THAT TRAITOR WHO SEES ONLY WITH ONE EYE AND HOLDS THE LAND WHICH SOME ONE HERE WITH ME WOULD FAIN BE FASTING FROM THE VISION OF
WHO ENTWINED EIGHT TIMES HIS TAIL ABOUT HIS STUBBORN BACK AND AFTER HE HAD BITTEN IT IN GREAT RAGE SAID OF THE THIEVISH FIRE A CULPRIT THIS
IF THOU HADST I MADE ANSWER THEREUPON ATTENDED TO THE CAUSE FOR WHICH I LOOKED PERHAPS A LONGER STAY THOU WOULDST HAVE PARDONED MEANWHILE MY GUIDE DEPARTED
THEREFORE THYSELF DISBURDEN OF ALL SADNESS AND MAKE ACCOUNT THAT I AM AYE BESIDE THEE IF E'ER IT COME TO PASS THAT FORTUNE BRING THEE WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN A LIKE DISPUTE
AND THIS IS TRUE AS THAT I SPEAK TO THEE MORE THAN A HUNDRED WERE THERE WHEN THEY HEARD HIM WHO IN THE MOAT STOOD STILL TO LOOK AT ME THROUGH WONDERMENT OBLIVIOUS OF THEIR TORTURE
AFTER THE FIRE A LITTLE MORE HAD ROARED IN ITS OWN FASHION THE SHARP POINT IT MOVED THIS WAY AND THAT AND THEN GAVE FORTH SUCH BREATH
THAT THEY WERE WISHFUL TO STAND STILL AND WEEP BUT SAID VIRGILIUS WHAT DOST THOU STILL GAZE AT
AND I TO HIM SHOW TO ME AND DECLARE IF THOU WOULDST HAVE ME BEAR UP NEWS OF THEE WHO IS THIS PERSON OF THE BITTER VISION THEN DID HE LAY HIS HAND UPON THE JAW OF ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS AND HIS MOUTH OPED CRYING
AND THEREFORE ARE CLEFT THUS A DEVIL IS BEHIND HERE WHO DOTH CLEAVE US THUS CRUELLY
TWIXT JULY AND SEPTEMBER AND OF MAREMMA AND SARDINIA ALL THE DISEASES IN ONE MOAT WERE GATHERED SUCH WAS IT HERE AND SUCH A STENCH CAME FROM IT AS FROM PUTRESCENT LIMBS IS WONT TO ISSUE
WHEN WAS THE AIR SO FULL OF PESTILENCE THE ANIMALS DOWN TO THE LITTLE WORM ALL FELL AND AFTERWARDS THE ANCIENT PEOPLE ACCORDING AS THE POETS HAVE AFFIRMED WERE FROM THE SEED OF ANTS RESTORED AGAIN
BENEATH THE GREEN PAWS FINDS ITSELF AGAIN VERRUCCHIO'S ANCIENT MASTIFF AND THE NEW
IF I WERE ONLY STILL SO LIGHT THAT IN A HUNDRED YEARS I COULD ADVANCE ONE INCH I HAD ALREADY STARTED ON THE WAY SEEKING HIM OUT AMONG THIS SQUALID FOLK ALTHOUGH THE CIRCUIT BE ELEVEN MILES AND BE NOT LESS THAN HALF A MILE ACROSS
THAT SO DISPROPORTIONS THE LIMBS WITH HUMOURS WHICH IT ILL CONCOCTS THAT THE FACE CORRESPONDS NOT TO THE BELLY COMPELLED HIM SO TO HOLD HIS LIPS APART AS DOES THE HECTIC WHO BECAUSE OF THIRST ONE TOW'RDS THE CHIN
IF THOU BUT LATELY INTO THIS BLIND WORLD HAST FALLEN DOWN FROM THAT SWEET LATIAN LAND WHEREFROM I BRING THE WHOLE OF MY TRANSGRESSION SAY IF THE ROMAGNUOLS HAVE PEACE OR WAR
THE PROMISE LONG WITH THE FULFILMENT SHORT WILL MAKE THEE TRIUMPH IN THY LOFTY SEAT FRANCIS CAME AFTERWARD WHEN I WAS DEAD FOR ME BUT ONE OF THE BLACK CHERUBIM SAID TO HIM TAKE HIM NOT DO ME NO WRONG
STILL IT APPEARED WITH AGONY TRANSFIXED THUS BY NOT HAVING ANY WAY OR ISSUE AT FIRST FROM OUT THE FIRE TO ITS OWN LANGUAGE CONVERTED WERE THE MELANCHOLY WORDS BUT AFTERWARDS
WOULD THAT IT WERE SEEING IT NEEDS MUST BE FOR TWILL AGGRIEVE ME MORE THE MORE I AGE WE WENT OUR WAY AND UP ALONG THE STAIRS THE BOURNS HAD MADE US TO DESCEND BEFORE
AND NOW DEPARTED FROM US WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE GENTLE POET WHEN YET ANOTHER WHICH BEHIND IT CAME CAUSED US TO TURN OUR EYES UPON ITS TOP BY A CONFUSED SOUND THAT ISSUED FROM IT
REMOUNTED MY CONDUCTOR AND DREW ME AND FOLLOWING THE SOLITARY PATH AMONG THE ROCKS AND RIDGES OF THE CRAG THE FOOT WITHOUT THE HAND SPED NOT AT ALL THEN SORROWED I
BECAUSE I PARTED PERSONS SO UNITED PARTED DO I NOW BEAR MY BRAIN ALAS FROM ITS BEGINNING WHICH IS IN THIS TRUNK
WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED WAY UP THROUGH THE POINT GIVING IT THAT VIBRATION THE TONGUE HAD GIVEN THEM IN THEIR PASSAGE OUT WE HEARD IT SAID O THOU AT WHOM I AIM MY VOICE AND WHO BUT NOW WAST SPEAKING LOMBARD SAYING
WHERE THOU WAST QUESTIONED OF THE TRUTH AT TROY IF I SPAKE FALSE THOU FALSIFIEDST THE COIN SAID SINON AND FOR ONE FAULT I AM HERE AND THOU FOR MORE THAN ANY OTHER DEMON
MY MASTER I REPLIED BY HEARING THEE I AM MORE SURE BUT I SURMISED ALREADY IT MIGHT BE SO AND ALREADY WISHED TO ASK THEE WHO IS WITHIN THAT FIRE WHICH COMES SO CLEFT AT TOP
AND NEVER SAW I PLIED A CURRYCOMB BY STABLE BOY FOR WHOM HIS MASTER WAITS OR HIM WHO KEEPS AWAKE UNWILLINGLY AS EVERY ONE WAS PLYING FAST THE BITE OF NAILS UPON HIMSELF FOR THE GREAT RAGE OF ITCHING
AND BEHIND HIM I WENT ALREADY MAKING MY REPLY AND SUPERADDING IN THAT CAVERN WHERE I HELD MINE EYES WITH SUCH ATTENTION FIXED I THINK A SPIRIT OF MY BLOOD LAMENTS THE SIN WHICH DOWN BELOW THERE COSTS SO MUCH THEN SAID THE MASTER
WE OF THE OARS MADE WINGS FOR OUR MAD FLIGHT EVERMORE GAINING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE ALREADY ALL THE STARS OF THE OTHER POLE THE NIGHT BEHELD AND OURS SO VERY LOW IT DID NOT RISE ABOVE THE OCEAN FLOOR
BUT FOR PURSUIT OF VIRTUE AND OF KNOWLEDGE SO EAGER DID I RENDER MY COMPANIONS WITH THIS BRIEF EXHORTATION FOR THE VOYAGE THAT THEN I HARDLY COULD HAVE HELD THEM BACK AND HAVING TURNED OUR STERN UNTO THE MORNING
I TURNED ME ROUND TOWARDS HIM WITH SUCH SHAME THAT STILL IT EDDIES THROUGH MY MEMORY AND AS HE IS WHO DREAMS OF HIS OWN HARM WHO DREAMING WISHES IT MAY BE A DREAM SO THAT HE CRAVES WHAT IS AS IF IT WERE NOT SUCH I BECAME
WHICH NO OTHER SUCCOUR HAD AND THE NAILS DOWNWARD WITH THEM DRAGGED THE SCAB IN FASHION AS A KNIFE THE SCALES OF BREAM OR ANY OTHER FISH THAT HAS THEM LARGEST
BECAUSE OF THE CONTRADICTION WHICH CONSENTS NOT O MISERABLE ME HOW I DID SHUDDER WHEN HE SEIZED ON ME SAYING PERADVENTURE THOU DIDST NOT THINK THAT I WAS A LOGICIAN HE BORE ME UNTO MINOS
LIVES BETWEEN TYRANNY AND A FREE STATE NOW I ENTREAT THEE TELL US WHO THOU ART BE NOT MORE STUBBORN THAN THE REST HAVE BEEN
FIVE TIMES REKINDLED AND AS MANY QUENCHED HAD BEEN THE SPLENDOUR UNDERNEATH THE MOON SINCE WE HAD ENTERED INTO THE DEEP PASS WHEN THERE APPEARED TO US A MOUNTAIN DIM FROM DISTANCE
THREE TIMES IT MADE HER WHIRL WITH ALL THE WATERS AT THE FOURTH TIME IT MADE THE STERN UPLIFT AND THE PROW DOWNWARD GO AS PLEASED ANOTHER
AND TO LICK UP THE MIRROR OF NARCISSUS THOU WOULDST NOT WANT WORDS MANY TO INVITE THEE
WHEN NOW THE FLAME HAD COME UNTO THAT POINT WHERE TO MY LEADER IT SEEMED TIME AND PLACE AFTER THIS FASHION DID I HEAR HIM SPEAK O YE WHO ARE TWOFOLD WITHIN ONE FIRE IF I DESERVED OF YOU WHILE I WAS LIVING
A CASK BY LOSING CENTRE PIECE OR CANT WAS NEVER SHATTERED SO AS I SAW ONE RENT FROM THE CHIN TO WHERE ONE BREAKETH WIND
BUT SO MAY IT SURVIVE NEATH MANY SUNS SAY TO ME WHO YE ARE AND OF WHAT PEOPLE LET NOT YOUR FOUL AND LOATHSOME PUNISHMENT MAKE YOU AFRAID TO SHOW YOURSELVES TO ME
BUT FOR THE HIGH PRIEST WHOM MAY ILL BETIDE WHO PUT ME BACK INTO MY FORMER SINS AND HOW AND WHEREFORE I WILL HAVE THEE HEAR WHILE I WAS STILL THE FORM OF BONE AND PULP MY MOTHER GAVE TO ME THE DEEDS I DID WERE NOT THOSE OF A LION BUT A FOX
BUT INASMUCH AS NEVER FROM THIS DEPTH DID ANY ONE RETURN IF I HEAR TRUE WITHOUT THE FEAR OF INFAMY I ANSWER I WAS A MAN OF ARMS THEN CORDELIER BELIEVING THUS BEGIRT TO MAKE AMENDS AND TRULY MY BELIEF HAD BEEN FULFILLED
THE SAME WHO GAVE TO THE YOUNG KING THE EVIL COMFORT I MADE THE FATHER AND THE SON REBELLIOUS
FROM ACUTE FEVER THEY SEND FORTH SUCH REEK AND ONE OF THEM WHO FELT HIMSELF ANNOYED AT BEING PERADVENTURE NAMED SO DARKLY SMOTE WITH THE FIST UPON HIS HARDENED PAUNCH IT GAVE A SOUND AS IF IT WERE A DRUM
HIS HEART WAS VISIBLE AND THE DISMAL SACK THAT MAKETH EXCREMENT OF WHAT IS EATEN WHILE I WAS ALL ABSORBED IN SEEING HIM HE LOOKED AT ME AND OPENED WITH HIS HANDS HIS BOSOM SAYING
BUT OPEN WAR I NONE HAVE LEFT THERE NOW RAVENNA STANDS AS IT LONG YEARS HAS STOOD THE EAGLE OF POLENTA THERE IS BROODING SO THAT SHE COVERS CERVIA WITH HER VANS
AND SAID O THOU WHOM GUILT DOTH NOT CONDEMN AND WHOM I ONCE SAW UP IN LATIAN LAND UNLESS TOO GREAT SIMILITUDE DECEIVE ME
AMONG THE THIEVES FIVE CITIZENS OF THINE LIKE THESE I FOUND WHENCE SHAME COMES UNTO ME AND THOU THEREBY TO NO GREAT HONOUR RISEST BUT IF WHEN MORN IS NEAR OUR DREAMS ARE TRUE
HAVE GIVEN ME GOOD I MAY MYSELF NOT GRUDGE IT AS MANY AS THE HIND WHO ON THE HILL RESTS AT THE TIME WHEN HE WHO LIGHTS THE WORLD HIS COUNTENANCE KEEPS LEAST CONCEALED FROM US WHILE AS THE FLY GIVES PLACE UNTO THE GNAT
CONSIDER IF TO COUNT THEM THOU BELIEVEST THAT TWO AND TWENTY MILES THE VALLEY WINDS AND NOW THE MOON IS UNDERNEATH OUR FEET HENCEFORTH THE TIME ALLOTTED US IS BRIEF AND MORE IS TO BE SEEN THAN WHAT THOU SEEST
FOR BRANDA'S FOUNT I WOULD NOT GIVE THE SIGHT ONE IS WITHIN ALREADY IF THE RAVING SHADES THAT ARE GOING ROUND ABOUT SPEAK TRUTH BUT WHAT AVAILS IT ME WHOSE LIMBS ARE TIED
LEAVE ME TO SPEAK BECAUSE I HAVE CONCEIVED THAT WHICH THOU WISHEST FOR THEY MIGHT DISDAIN PERCHANCE SINCE THEY WERE GREEKS DISCOURSE OF THINE
HIS SON BUT UNTO THE LAST BOLGIA OF THE TEN FOR ALCHEMY WHICH IN THE WORLD I PRACTISED
SPREAD OUT THE NETS THAT I MAY TAKE THE LIONESS AND HER WHELPS UPON THE PASSAGE AND THEN EXTENDED HIS UNPITYING CLAWS SEIZING THE FIRST WHO HAD THE NAME LEARCHUS AND WHIRLED HIM ROUND AND DASHED HIM ON A ROCK AND SHE
TO CURE HIM OF THE FEVER OF HIS PRIDE COUNSEL HE ASKED OF ME AND I WAS SILENT BECAUSE HIS WORDS APPEARED INEBRIATE AND THEN HE SAID BE NOT THY HEART AFRAID HENCEFORTH I THEE ABSOLVE
BEGAN TO WAVE ITSELF ABOUT EVEN AS A FLAME DOTH WHICH THE WIND FATIGUES THEREAFTERWARD THE SUMMIT TO AND FRO MOVING AS IF IT WERE THE TONGUE THAT SPAKE IT UTTERED FORTH A VOICE AND SAID
AND EVERY FLAME A SINNER STEALS AWAY I STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE UPRISEN TO SEE SO THAT IF I HAD SEIZED NOT ON A ROCK DOWN HAD I FALLEN WITHOUT BEING PUSHED AND THE LEADER WHO BEHELD ME SO ATTENT EXCLAIMED
AND THOU SHALT SEE I AM CAPOCCHIO'S SHADE WHO METALS FALSIFIED BY ALCHEMY THOU MUST REMEMBER IF I WELL DESCRY THEE
THE OTHER UPWARD TURNS O YE WHO WITHOUT ANY TORMENT ARE AND WHY I KNOW NOT IN THE WORLD OF WOE HE SAID TO US BEHOLD AND BE ATTENTIVE UNTO THE MISERY OF MASTER ADAM
NOT HAVING POWER TO SPEAK FOR TO EXCUSE MYSELF I WISHED AND STILL EXCUSED MYSELF AND DID NOT THINK I DID IT LESS SHAME DOTH WASH AWAY A GREATER FAULT THE MASTER SAID THAN THIS OF THINE HAS BEEN
HOW MUTILATED SEE IS MAHOMET IN FRONT OF ME DOTH ALI WEEPING GO CLEFT IN THE FACE FROM FORELOCK UNTO CHIN AND ALL THE OTHERS WHOM THOU HERE BEHOLDEST DISSEMINATORS OF SCANDAL AND OF SCHISM WHILE LIVING WERE
LYING THERE CLOSE UPON THY RIGHT HAND CONFINES I FOUND THEM HERE REPLIED HE WHEN I RAINED INTO THIS CHASM AND SINCE THEY HAVE NOT TURNED NOR DO I THINK THEY WILL FOR EVERMORE ONE THE FALSE WOMAN IS WHO ACCUSED JOSEPH
AND EVER SINCE I HAVE CONTINUED TO SERVE GOD WITH MORE FERVENCY THAN BEFORE I AM PERSUADED DEAR LADY THAT HE HAS SENT YOU HITHER FOR MY COMFORT FOR WHICH I RENDER HIM INFINITE THANKS FOR I MUST OWN
WE SET SAIL WITH A FAIR WIND AND SOON CLEARED THE PERSIAN GULF WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE OPEN SEA WE STEERED OUR COURSE TO THE INDIES AND THE TWENTIETH DAY SAW LAND IT WAS A VERY HIGH MOUNTAIN
YOU MUST KNOW THAT THIS CITY WAS THE METROPOLIS OF A MIGHTY KINGDOM OVER WHICH THE SULTAN MY FATHER REIGNED THAT PRINCE HIS WHOLE COURT THE INHABITANTS OF THE CITY AND ALL HIS OTHER SUBJECTS
INSTEAD OF WHICH IN A WAY OTHER THAN IS AGREEABLE TO ITS NATURE IT I WILL NOT SAY FULFILS ITS FUNCTION BUT FEIGNS TO FULFIL IT WHICH OF THESE TWO WOULD IN THY VIEW BE THE STRONGER I GUESS THY MEANING BUT I PRAY THEE
AND TWO CANDLESTICKS WITH LARGE TAPERS OF WHITE WAX BURNING I SAW A LITTLE CARPET LAID DOWN LIKE THOSE WE HAVE TO KNEEL UPON WHEN WE SAY OUR PRAYERS AND A COMELY YOUNG MAN SAT ON THIS CARPET
THE OTHER ATTAIN IT NOT IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT THE GOOD ARE ENDUED WITH POWER WHILE THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE WEAK IF ANY DOUBT IT HE IS INCAPABLE OF REFLECTING ON THE NATURE OF THINGS OR THE CONSEQUENCES INVOLVED IN REASONING
AFTER WE HAD LADEN THE VESSEL WITH WHAT WE THOUGHT MOST DESIRABLE WE TOOK SUCH PROVISIONS AND WATER ABOARD AS WERE NECESSARY FOR OUR VOYAGE
THE NAME OF THE OTHER IS SAFIE AND MY OWN ZOBEIDE AFTER OUR FATHER'S DEATH THE PROPERTY THAT HE LEFT WAS EQUALLY DIVIDED AMONG US AND
AND PERCEIVING IN HIM SO MUCH GOOD NATURE AND BEAUTY I FELT EMOTIONS I HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE HE MADE ME SIT DOWN BY HIM AND BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS DISCOURSE I COULD NOT FORBEAR SAYING WITH AN AIR THAT DISCOVERED THE SENTIMENTS I FELT
FOR HE WAS METAMORPHOSED INTO A BLACK STONE AS HE IS TO BE SEEN IN THIS PALACE AND THE QUEEN MY MOTHER HAD THE LIKE DESTINY I AM THE ONLY PERSON WHO DID NOT SUFFER UNDER THAT HEAVY JUDGMENT
BY RIOTOUS LIVING AND DEBAUCHERY SPENT ALL AND FINDING HIMSELF REDUCED TO POVERTY FOUND A PRETEXT FOR DIVORCING MY SISTER
NO ONE BUT THE GUARDS IN THE VESTIBULE ALL PETRIFIED SOME STANDING SOME SITTING AND SOME LYING I CAME TO A LARGE COURT WHERE I SAW BEFORE ME A STATELY BUILDING THE WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE INCLOSED WITH GATES OF MESSY GOLD
BRING WITH THEM ANYTHING OF SUCH SORT AS SEEMS TO HAVE NOTHING WANTING TO IT THAT IS GOOD WE TOO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME ARE MADE HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF THESE THINGS BUT IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FULFIL THEIR PROMISES AND MOREOVER
AFTER THE SAME MANNER AND IN THE SAME TONE AS IT IS READ IN OUR MOSQUES BEING EXTREMELY GLAD TO HEAR IT I IMMEDIATELY AROSE AND TAKING A TORCH IN MY HAND PASSED FROM ONE CHAMBER TO ANOTHER
THE ABILITY TO COMMIT CRIME CANNOT BE REFERRED TO THE GOOD THEREFORE IT IS NOT A THING TO BE DESIRED AND YET ALL POWER IS DESIRABLE IT IS CLEAR THEN THAT ABILITY TO DO EVIL IS NOT POWER
HOWEVER TO WIN AMPLER CREDENCE FOR MY CONCLUSION I WILL PURSUE BOTH PATHS AND DRAW CONFIRMATION FOR MY STATEMENTS FIRST IN ONE WAY AND THEN IN THE OTHER THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY HUMAN ACTION DEPENDS UPON TWO THINGS
VERILY WONDROUS GREAT ARE THY PROMISES YET I DO NOT DOUBT BUT THOU CANST MAKE THEM GOOD ONLY KEEP ME NOT IN SUSPENSE AFTER RAISING SUCH HOPES LEARN THEN FIRST SAID SHE HOW THAT POWER EVER WAITS UPON THE GOOD
THEN WE HAVE WORKED ROUND TO AN OPPOSITE CONCLUSION THE WEALTH WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO MAKE A MAN INDEPENDENT RATHER PUTS HIM IN NEED OF FURTHER PROTECTION HOW IN THE WORLD THEN
AND UPON THE THRONE THERE WAS A BED OF RICH STUFF EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS WHAT SURPRISED ME MOST WAS A SPARKLING LIGHT WHICH CAME FROM ABOVE THE BED BEING CURIOUS TO KNOW WHENCE IT PROCEEDED I ASCENDED THE STEPS
TOLD ME THEY INTENDED TO MARRY AGAIN I OBSERVED THAT IF PUTTING ME TO EXPENSE WAS THE ONLY REASON THEY MIGHT LAY THOSE THOUGHTS ASIDE AND BE WELCOME TO REMAIN FOR WHAT I HAD WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN US ALL THREE
AND HANGING OUT ITS TONGUE WHICH INDUCED ME TO CONCLUDE IT HAD RECEIVED SOME INJURY I INSTANTLY AROSE AND PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS PURSUED BY A LARGER SERPENT WHICH HAD HOLD OF ITS TAIL AND WAS ENDEAVOURING TO DEVOUR IT
AND LIFTING UP MY HEAD SAW A DIAMOND AS LARGE AS THE EGG OF AN OSTRICH LYING UPON A LOW STOOL IT WAS SO PURE THAT I COULD NOT FIND THE LEAST BLEMISH IN IT AND IT SPARKLED WITH SO MUCH BRILLIANCY
THE ABSENCE OF THE OTHER ADMITTED BUT A MAN LACKS THAT OF WHICH HE IS IN WANT HE DOES
WHY CERTAINLY NOT THERE IS NO DENYING IT CANST THOU THEN DOUBT THAT HE WHOM THOU SEEST TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE WILLED
TO GET ABOARD MY SHIP I LAID MYSELF DOWN UPON A COUCH NOT WITHOUT SOME DREAD TO BE ALONE IN A DESOLATE PLACE AND THIS FEAR HINDERED MY SLEEP ABOUT MIDNIGHT
WE CONTINUED THUS A WHOLE YEAR IN PERFECT LOVE AND HARMONY SEEING THAT GOD HAD INCREASED MY SMALL STOCK I PROJECTED A VOYAGE TO EMBARK SOME OF IT IN A COMMERCIAL SPECULATION TO THIS END
HER HUSBAND HAD TREATED HER AFTER THE SAME MANNER AND I RECEIVED HER LIKEWISE WITH THE SAME AFFECTION AS I HAD DONE THE FORMER SOME TIME AFTER MY TWO SISTERS
AND THEY HAD ALL SUCH DREADFUL COUNTENANCES THAT I WAS GREATLY ALARMED BUT PERCEIVING THEY REMAINED STATIONARY AND DID NOT SO MUCH AS MOVE THEIR EYES I TOOK COURAGE AND WENT NEARER WHEN I FOUND THEY WERE ALL TURNED INTO STONES
BUT ABUNDANTLY MORE WISE THAN WE IF YOU WILL VOUCHSAFE TO RECEIVE US ONCE MORE INTO YOUR HOUSE AND ACCOUNT US YOUR SLAVES WE SHALL NEVER COMMIT A SIMILAR FAULT AGAIN MY ANSWER WAS DEAR SISTERS
AND WHY I ALONE AM SAFE IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A TERRIBLE DISASTER I TOLD HIM IN A FEW WORDS WHENCE I HAD COME WHAT HAD MADE ME UNDERTAKE THE VOYAGE AND HOW I SAFELY ARRIVED AT THE PORT AFTER TWENTY DAYS SAILING
SEE HIS PILES OF GOLD RISE HIGH THOUGH HE GATHER STORE OF TREASURE THAT CAN NEVER SATISFY THOUGH WITH PEARLS HIS GORGET BLAZES RAREST THAT THE OCEAN YIELDS THOUGH A HUNDRED HEAD OF OXEN TRAVAIL IN HIS AMPLE FIELDS
THE SHIP I CAME IN MAY SERVE IN SOME MEASURE TO CONVINCE YOU
FOR IF THIS EVER GAPING EVER CRAVING WANT IS GLUTTED BY WEALTH IT NEEDS MUST BE THAT THE WANT ITSELF WHICH CAN BE SO GLUTTED STILL REMAINS I DO NOT SPEAK OF HOW VERY LITTLE SUFFICES FOR NATURE
I APPROACHED IN HOPES TO FIND SOME
AS WE WERE ONE DAY CONVERSING ABOUT OUR THIRD SISTER AND WONDERING WE RECEIVED NO INTELLIGENCE OF HER
THAT WE SHOULD ASSERT THAT THE BAD WHO FORM THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND DO NOT EXIST BUT THE FACT IS SO I DO NOT INDEED DENY THAT THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE BAD BUT THAT THEY ARE IN AN UNQUALIFIED AND ABSOLUTE SENSE I DENY
FOR MY SISTERS GREW JEALOUS OF THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND MYSELF AND MALICIOUSLY ASKED ME ONE DAY WHAT WE SHOULD DO WITH HIM WHEN WE CAME TO BAGDAD I PERCEIVED IMMEDIATELY
AND HOW FOR AVARICE NOTHING IS ENOUGH WHEREFORE IF WEALTH CANNOT GET RID OF WANT AND MAKES NEW WANTS OF ITS OWN
WHICH STOOD OPEN A CURTAIN OF SILK STUFF SEEMED TO BE DRAWN BEFORE IT A LAMP HUNG OVER THE ENTRANCE AFTER I HAD SURVEYED THE BUILDING I MADE NO DOUBT BUT IT WAS THE PALACE OF THE PRINCE WHO REIGNED OVER THAT COUNTRY
AND I DARE ENGAGE TO PROMISE YOU SANCTUARY THERE UNTIL THE MIGHTY COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL
I RECEIVED HER WITH EVERY POSSIBLE TENDERNESS AND INQUIRING INTO THE CAUSE OF HER DISTRESS SHE TOLD ME WITH TEARS HOW INHUMANLY HER HUSBAND HAD BEHAVED TOWARDS HER HER MISFORTUNES AFFECTED ME AND I MINGLED MY TEARS WITH HERS
FOR SINCE GOOD AND EVIL ARE CONTRARIES IF IT IS MADE PLAIN THAT GOOD IS POWER THE FEEBLENESS OF EVIL IS CLEARLY SEEN AND CONVERSELY IF THE FRAIL NATURE OF EVIL IS MADE MANIFEST THE STRENGTH OF GOOD IS THEREBY KNOWN
AND IN THIS YOUR MAJESTY MAY SEE I AM MORE TO BE PITIED THAN BLAMED IF THERE BE ANY THING ELSE RELATING TO MYSELF
FOR IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED SEVERAL VESSELS MORE TO CONVEY TO BAGDAD
THE BAD HAVE AN ABILITY NOR DO I WISH TO DENY IT ONLY THIS ABILITY OF THEIRS COMES NOT FROM STRENGTH BUT FROM IMPOTENCE FOR THEIR ABILITY IS TO DO EVIL
THE IMPORTANT SERVICES YOU HAVE RENDERED ME THAN BY WHAT I HAVE JUST DONE THE TREACHERY OF YOUR SISTERS WAS WELL KNOWN TO ME AND TO AVENGE YOUR WRONGS AS SOON AS I WAS LIBERATED BY YOUR GENEROUS ASSISTANCE
ON THAT SIDE FROM WHENCE THE SOUND PROCEEDED I CAME TO THE CLOSET DOOR AND STOOD STILL NOT DOUBTING THAT IT CAME FROM THENCE I SET DOWN MY TORCH UPON THE GROUND
BUT WHICH THEY CANNOT WIN OR HOLD NAY THEIR FAILURE CONCERNS THE VERY SUM AND CROWN OF THINGS POOR WRETCHES THEY FAIL TO COMPASS EVEN THAT FOR WHICH THEY TOIL DAY AND NIGHT
SUCH AS JEWELS GOLD AND MONEY WE LEFT THE FURNITURE AND GOODS WHICH CONSISTED OF AN INFINITE QUANTITY OF PLATE
WAS THY MIND NEVER TROUBLED IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME WRONG DONE TO THEE NAY SAID I
FOR I AM THE YOUNGEST MARRIED AND LEFT ME ALONE SOME TIME AFTER MY ELDEST SISTER'S HUSBAND SOLD ALL THAT HE HAD AND WITH THAT MONEY AND MY SISTER'S PORTION THEY WENT BOTH INTO AFRICA WHERE HER HUSBAND
FOR THEY CANNOT FIGHT AGAINST VICE OR DO THEY KNOWINGLY AND WILFULLY FORSAKE THE GOOD AND TURN ASIDE TO VICE WHY AT THIS RATE THEY NOT ONLY CEASE TO HAVE POWER BUT CEASE TO BE AT ALL FOR THEY WHO FORSAKE THE COMMON END OF ALL THINGS THAT ARE
AND AT LAST CAME INTO A LARGE ROOM WHERE THERE WAS A THRONE OF MASSIVE GOLD
WHEREAS IF THERE BE NO POWER THE WILL IS ALL IN VAIN AND SO IF THOU SEEST ANY MAN WISHING TO ATTAIN SOME END YET UTTERLY FAILING TO ATTAIN IT THOU CANST NOT DOUBT THAT HE LACKED THE POWER OF GETTING WHAT HE WISHED FOR
SIR I HUMBLY BEG OF YOU TO GIVE YOUR CONSENT FOR AS SOON AS WE COME TO BAGDAD I DESIRE TO OFFER YOU MY PERSON TO BE YOUR SLAVE
AS SOON AS I WAS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING IT SHE EXPLAINED TO ME ALL THE PASSAGES OF THIS EXCELLENT BOOK AND INFUSED PIETY INTO MY MIND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER OR ANY OTHER PERSON SHE HAPPENED TO DIE
THAT NOTHING HAS MORE POWER THAN SUPREME GOOD WE DID SAID I BUT THAT SAME HIGHEST GOOD CANNOT DO EVIL CERTAINLY NOT IS THERE ANYONE THEN WHO THINKS THAT MEN ARE ABLE TO DO ALL THINGS NONE BUT A MADMAN
HEAR ME O LORD AND GRANT MY REQUEST THE YOUNG MAN TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS ME AND SAID MY GOOD LADY PRAY LET ME KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS DESOLATE CITY
JUDGE WHAT WAS MY SURPRISE WHEN I AWOKE TO SEE STANDING BY ME A BLACK WOMAN OF LIVELY AND AGREEABLE FEATURES WHO HELD IN HER HAND TWO BITCHES OF THE SAME COLOUR FASTENED TOGETHER I SAT UP
I FOUND MOST OF THE SHOPS SHUT AND IN SUCH AS WERE OPEN I LIKEWISE FOUND THE PEOPLE PETRIFIED HAVING REACHED A VAST SQUARE IN THE HEART OF THE CITY I PERCEIVED A LARGE FOLDING GATE COVERED WITH PLATES OF GOLD
I LOST MYSELF AMONG THE APARTMENTS AND PERCEIVING I WAS COME BACK AGAIN TO THE LARGE ROOM WHERE THE THRONE THE COUCH THE LARGE DIAMOND AND THE TORCHES STOOD I RESOLVED TO TAKE MY NIGHT'S LODGING THERE AND TO DEPART THE NEXT MORNING EARLY
WILL GIVE YOU FULL INFORMATION IN THE RELATION OF HER STORY AFTER THE CALIPH HAD HEARD ZOBEIDE WITH MUCH ASTONISHMENT
CAN WANT BE DRIVEN AWAY BY RICHES CANNOT THE RICH FEEL HUNGER CANNOT THEY THIRST ARE NOT THE LIMBS OF THE WEALTHY SENSITIVE TO THE WINTER'S COLD BUT THOU WILT SAY
AND THE EMPLOYMENT I FOLLOW OF BREEDING SILK WORMS ASSURE YOURSELF THERE IS NOTHING I HAVE BUT IS AT YOUR SERVICE AND AS MUCH AT YOUR DISPOSAL AS MY OWN WE LIVED VERY COMFORTABLY TOGETHER FOR SOME MONTHS
AND THE YOUNG PRINCE WHOM THEY HAVE DROWNED I WAS FORCED TO PROMISE OBEDIENCE SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE WHIPPED THEM EVERY NIGHT THOUGH WITH REGRET WHEREOF YOUR MAJESTY HAS BEEN A WITNESS
YET IN SOME WISE NOTWITHSTANDING YE DISCERN THE TRUE END OF HAPPINESS AND SO THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS YOU THITHER TO THAT TRUE GOOD WHILE ERROR IN MANY FORMS LEADS YOU ASTRAY THEREFROM
IT SEEMS SO BUT IF THE BAD WERE TO ATTAIN THE GOOD WHICH IS THEIR OBJECT THEY COULD NOT BE BAD NO
FOR REFLECT WHETHER MEN ARE ABLE TO WIN HAPPINESS BY THOSE MEANS THROUGH WHICH THEY THINK TO REACH THE PROPOSED END TRULY IF EITHER WEALTH RANK OR ANY OF THE REST
I STOOD SOME TIME ADMIRING THE RICHES AND MAGNIFICENCE OF THE ROOM BUT ABOVE ALL
IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DARE VENTURE A SECOND TIME YOU KNOW HOW RARE IT IS TO MEET WITH A HUSBAND PERFECTLY VIRTUOUS AND DESERVING BELIEVE WHAT I SAY AND LET US LIVE TOGETHER AS COMFORTABLY AS WE CAN
AS SOON AS THESE TWO SISTERS RECEIVED THEIR PORTIONS THEY LEFT ME TO LIVE WITH THEIR MOTHER MY OTHER TWO SISTERS AND MYSELF STAYED WITH OUR MOTHER WHO WAS THEN ALIVE AND WHO WHEN SHE AFTERWARDS DIED
AT LAST WE SET SAIL WITH A WIND AS FAVOURABLE AS WE COULD WISH THE YOUNG PRINCE MY SISTERS AND MYSELF ENJOYED OURSELVES FOR SOME TIME VERY AGREEABLY BUT ALAS THIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING DID NOT LAST LONG
THAT THIS SOLITARY LIFE IS EXTREMELY IRKSOME ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS AND PARTICULARLY THE LAST GREATLY INCREASED MY LOVE FOR HIM PRINCE SAID I THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT PROVIDENCE HAS BROUGHT ME INTO YOUR PORT TO AFFORD YOU AN OPPORTUNITY
OF COURSE NOT THEN IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH A MAN IS TO BE RECKONED STRONG IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WEAK GRANTED SAID I THEN DOST THOU REMEMBER THAT BY OUR FORMER REASONINGS
SORROW HIS SPIRIT VEXES SORE AND EMPTY HOPES DELUDE
WHEN I HAD DONE I PRAYED HIM TO PERFORM HIS PROMISE AND TOLD HIM HOW MUCH I WAS STRUCK BY THE FRIGHTFUL DESOLATION WHICH I HAD SEEN IN THE CITY LADY SAID THE YOUNG MAN HAVE PATIENCE FOR A MOMENT
WHO CAN VENTURE TO DENY IT YET HE WOULD NOT UNLESS HE POSSESSED THE MONEY WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE NO HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT
CANNOT MAKE ITS POSSESSOR INDEPENDENT AND FREE FROM ALL WANT YET THIS WAS WHAT IT SEEMED TO PROMISE MOREOVER I THINK THIS ALSO WELL DESERVES TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE SPECIAL NATURE OF MONEY
WHEREAS THE BAD TRY TO ATTAIN THIS SAME GOOD THROUGH ALL MANNER OF CONCUPISCENCE WHICH IS NOT THE NATURAL WAY OF ATTAINING GOOD OR DOST THOU THINK OTHERWISE NAY RATHER ONE FURTHER CONSEQUENCE IS CLEAR TO ME
AND TO RESIGN MYSELF WHOLLY TO YOUR COMMANDS THE PRINCE REPLIED I KNOW NOT MADAM WHETHER YOU BE IN JEST OR NO BUT FOR MY PART I SERIOUSLY DECLARE BEFORE THESE LADIES YOUR SISTERS
IN A MANNER ANSWERABLE TO OUR CONDITION BUT I ADDED I RATHER BELIEVE YOU WISH TO MARRY AGAIN I SHALL FEEL MUCH SURPRISED IF SUCH BE THE CASE AFTER THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE HAD OF THE LITTLE SATISFACTION THERE IS IN WEDLOCK
I CONCLUDED IT TO BE THE QUEEN'S APARTMENTS I ENTERED AND IN A LARGE HALL I FOUND SEVERAL BLACK EUNUCHS TURNED INTO STONE I WENT FROM THENCE INTO A ROOM RICHLY FURNISHED
THE DOOR BEING ONLY HALF SHUT I OPENED IT WENT IN AND STANDING UPRIGHT BEFORE THE NICHE I REPEATED THIS PRAYER ALOUD PRAISE BE TO GOD WHO HAS FAVOURED US WITH A HAPPY VOYAGE
I SOON DRIED MY CLOTHES IN THE SUN AND AS I WALKED ALONG I FOUND SEVERAL KINDS OF FRUIT AND LIKEWISE FRESH WATER WHICH GAVE ME SOME HOPES OF PRESERVING MY LIFE I HAD JUST LAID MYSELF DOWN TO REST IN A SHADE
HOWEVER IT MADE ME IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS SOME LIVING CREATURE IN THIS PLACE FOR I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TORCHES CONTINUED THUS BURNING OF THEMSELVES SEVERAL OTHER RARITIES DETAINED MY CURIOSITY IN THIS ROOM
WHERE I BOUGHT A SHIP READY FITTED FOR SEA
I ENTERED THE TOWN AND PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS WHERE AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS STOOD MEN IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES BUT ALL MOTIONLESS AND PETRIFIED IN THE QUARTER INHABITED BY THE MERCHANTS
LACK MANY GOOD THINGS IS NOT THE HAPPINESS MEN SEEK IN THEM CLEARLY DISCOVERED TO BE A FALSE SHOW THEREFORE DO I FIRST ASK THEE THYSELF WHO BUT LATELY WERT LIVING IN AFFLUENCE AMID ALL THAT ABUNDANCE OF WEALTH
I HAVE NOT ALTERED MY MIND WITH RESPECT TO YOU SINCE WE LAST PARTED COME AGAIN AND TAKE PART OF WHAT I HAVE UPON THIS I EMBRACED THEM AND WE LIVED TOGETHER AS BEFORE
WHILE THE BAD ARE LEFT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH
BUT NOT BEFORE SHE HAD PERFECTLY INSTRUCTED ME IN ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY TO CONVINCE ME OF THE TRUTH OF THE MOOSULMAUN RELIGION AFTER HER DEATH I PERSISTED WITH CONSTANCY IN THE BELIEF OF ITS DIVINITY
WHOM I HAVE TRANSFORMED INTO THIS SHAPE BUT THIS PUNISHMENT WILL NOT SUFFICE AND MY WILL IS THAT YOU TREAT THEM HEREAFTER
AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH WE PERCEIVED A GREAT TOWN HAVING A FRESH GALE WE SOON REACHED THE HARBOUR AND CAST ANCHOR I HAD NOT PATIENCE TO WAIT TILL MY SISTERS WERE DRESSED TO GO ALONG WITH ME BUT WENT ASHORE ALONE IN THE BOAT
WHO SO ATTAINS THE END OF HIS DESIRES THAT NOTHING FURTHER TO BE DESIRED LIES BEYOND WHENCE FOLLOWS THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THEY WHO ARE WICKED ARE SEEN LIKEWISE TO BE WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH FOR WHY DO THEY FORSAKE VIRTUE AND FOLLOW VICE
AND ASKED HER WHO SHE WAS I AM SAID SHE THE SERPENT WHOM YOU LATELY DELIVERED FROM MY MORTAL ENEMY
AFTER I HAD PRESENTED MY SISTERS TO THE PRINCE I TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HINDERED MY RETURN THE DAY BEFORE HOW I HAD MET WITH THE YOUNG PRINCE HIS STORY AND THE CAUSE OF THE DESOLATION OF SO FINE A CITY
AT THESE WORDS HE SHUT THE KORAUN PUT IT INTO A RICH CASE AND LAID IT IN THE NICHE
TO HINDER ITS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE WHO POSSESS IT AGAINST THEIR WILL I ADMIT IT WHY OF COURSE WHEN EVERY DAY THE STRONGER WRESTS IT FROM THE WEAKER WITHOUT HIS CONSENT ELSE WHENCE COME LAWSUITS
WHICH WAS INESTIMABLE IN VALUE WERE IT ONLY FOR THE DIAMOND I MENTIONED THE DOORS BEING ALL OPEN OR BUT HALF SHUT I SURVEYED SOME OTHER APARTMENTS THAT WERE AS BEAUTIFUL AS THOSE I HAD ALREADY SEEN
I TOOK HER TO A BATH CLOTHED HER WITH MY OWN APPAREL AND THUS ADDRESSED HER SISTER YOU ARE THE ELDER AND I ESTEEM YOU AS MY MOTHER DURING YOUR ABSENCE GOD HAS BLEST THE PORTION THAT FELL TO MY SHARE
BUT SINCE I SEE THEE SO READY AT UNDERSTANDING I WILL HEAP PROOF ON PROOF LOOK HOW MANIFEST IS THE EXTREMITY OF VICIOUS MEN'S WEAKNESS THEY CANNOT EVEN REACH THAT GOAL TO WHICH THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS AND ALMOST CONSTRAINS THEM
FOR FROM MY ADMISSIONS IT MUST NEEDS FOLLOW THAT THE GOOD HAVE POWER AND THE BAD ARE IMPOTENT THOU ANTICIPATEST RIGHTLY AND THAT AS PHYSICIANS RECKON IS A SIGN THAT NATURE IS SET WORKING
THE RICH HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO SATE THEIR HUNGER THE MEANS TO GET RID OF THIRST AND COLD TRUE ENOUGH WANT CAN THUS BE SOOTHED BY RICHES WHOLLY REMOVED IT CANNOT BE
WITH ONE INDISTINGUISHABLE PURPOSE STRIVE TO REACH GOOD YES THAT FOLLOWS BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT BY THE ATTAINMENT OF GOOD MEN BECOME GOOD IT IS THEN DO THE GOOD ATTAIN THEIR OBJECT
AND THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT GRATIFYING MY CURIOSITY IN THE MEAN TIME NIGHT CAME ON WHICH REMINDED ME THAT IT WAS TIME TO RETIRE I PROPOSED TO RETURN THE WAY I HAD ENTERED BUT I COULD NOT FIND IT
IS IT FROM IGNORANCE OF WHAT IS GOOD WELL WHAT IS MORE WEAK AND FEEBLE THAN THE BLINDNESS OF IGNORANCE DO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY OUGHT TO FOLLOW BUT LUST DRIVES THEM ASIDE OUT OF THE WAY IF IT BE SO THEY ARE STILL FRAIL BY REASON OF THEIR INCONTINENCE
WERE MAGI WORSHIPPERS OF FIRE AND OF NARDOUN THE ANCIENT KING OF THE GIANTS WHO REBELLED AGAINST GOD BUT THOUGH I WAS BORN OF AN IDOLATROUS FATHER AND MOTHER I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE IN MY YOUTH TO HAVE A GOVERNESS
WHICH I HIT UPON THE HEAD AND KILLED THE OTHER FINDING ITSELF AT LIBERTY TOOK WING AND FLEW AWAY I LOOKED AFTER IT FOR SOME TIME TILL IT DISAPPEARED I THEN SOUGHT ANOTHER SHADY SPOT FOR REPOSE AND FELL ASLEEP
MY VESSEL IS AT YOUR SERVICE
THE SEAMEN WERE TAKEN UP SEVERAL DAYS IN UNLADING THE MERCHANDIZE I BROUGHT WITH ME AND EMBARKING
THE WISE ALONE ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD WHILE THE WICKED FOLLOW THEIR OWN HEARTS LUST BUT CAN NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY WOULD FOR THEY GO ON IN THEIR WILFULNESS
MY TEARS TESTIFY WITH HOW MUCH SORROW AND RELUCTANCE
AND PROVED TO BE A FLAT ON THE COAST WHICH WHEN DAY APPEARED I FOUND TO BE A DESERT ISLAND
READING WITH GREAT DEVOTION THE KORAUN WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM ON A DESK AT THIS SIGHT I WAS TRANSPORTED WITH ADMIRATION I WONDERED HOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT HE SHOULD BE THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE
HE ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND WE CONVERSED THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT CONCERNING OUR EMBARKATION AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY WE LEFT THE PALACE
THE WORDS WERE THESE INHABITANTS ABANDON THE WORSHIP OF NARDOUN AND OF FIRE AND WORSHIP THE ONLY GOD WHO SHEWS MERCY THIS VOICE WAS HEARD THREE YEARS SUCCESSIVELY BUT NO ONE WAS CONVERTED
IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE WHOLE AIM OF MAN'S WILL THOUGH THE MEANS OF PURSUIT VARY IS SET INTENTLY UPON HAPPINESS I DO REMEMBER THAT THIS TOO WAS PROVED DOST THOU ALSO CALL TO MIND HOW HAPPINESS IS ABSOLUTE GOOD
SHE DELIVERED TO ME THE TWO BITCHES AND SAID IF YOU WOULD NOT BE CHANGED INTO A SIMILAR FORM I COMMAND YOU IN THE NAME OF HIM THAT GOVERNS THE SEA TO GIVE EACH OF YOUR SISTERS EVERY NIGHT ONE HUNDRED LASHES WITH A ROD
AND MAY HE BE GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO PROTECT US IN THE SAME MANNER
THAT THEY PUT THIS QUESTION ON PURPOSE TO DISCOVER MY INCLINATIONS THEREFORE RESOLVING TO PUT IT OFF WITH A JEST I ANSWERED I WILL TAKE HIM FOR MY HUSBAND AND UPON THAT TURNING MYSELF TO THE PRINCE SAID
BUT HAD IN THE COURSE OF A HUNDRED YEARS GROWN INTO THE GRIMMEST LARGEST MOST GROTESQUE TREES I HAVE EVER SEEN OF THE KIND I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE AFRAID OF THEM EVEN IN THE DAYTIME BUT THEY DID ME NO HURT
NAY BY NO MEANS SAID I THEN HAPPINESS MUST CERTAINLY NOT BE SOUGHT IN THESE THINGS WHICH SEVERALLY ARE BELIEVED TO AFFORD SOME ONE OF THE BLESSINGS MOST TO BE DESIRED THEY MUST NOT I ADMIT
FOR AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR IT IS NOT DARK THERE ALL NIGHT LONG WHEN THE SKY IS UNCLOUDED AWAY IN THE NORTH WAS THE GREAT BEAR I KNEW THAT CONSTELLATION FOR BY IT ONE OF THE MEN HAD TAUGHT ME TO FIND THE POLE STAR
INDEED SAID I I SEE CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT NEITHER IS INDEPENDENCE TO BE FOUND IN WEALTH NOR POWER IN SOVEREIGNTY NOR REVERENCE IN DIGNITIES NOR FAME IN GLORY NOR TRUE JOY IN PLEASURES
BUT HIM WE MOST WORTHILY ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE THE MOST SUPREMELY EXCELLENT OF ALL THINGS IF HOWEVER IT IS IN HIM BY NATURE YET IS LOGICALLY DISTINCT THE THOUGHT IS INCONCEIVABLE
AND AS I SLEPT I DREAMED MY DREAM THE SUN WAS LOOKING VERY GRAVE AND THE MOON REFLECTED HIS CONCERN THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH ME AT LENGTH THE SUN SHOOK HIS HEAD
HOW CAN WE DOUBT HIM TO BE GOOD THAN WHOM THERE IS NOTHING BETTER NOW REASON SHOWS GOD TO BE GOOD IN SUCH WISE AS TO PROVE THAT IN HIM IS PERFECT GOOD FOR WERE IT NOT SO
HE FOLDED ME CLOSE TO HIM AND SAID HUSH RANALD MY BOY HERE I AM YOU ARE QUITE SAFE I NESTLED AS CLOSE TO HIM AS I COULD GO AND WEPT FOR BLESSEDNESS OH PAPA I SOBBED
THEY CANNOT IN ANY WISE BE DISPUTED BUT COME SEE HOW STRICTLY AND INCONTROVERTIBLY THOU MAYST PROVE THIS OUR ASSERTION
HE WOULD NOT BE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS FOR THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE MORE EXCELLENT POSSESSED OF PERFECT GOOD WHICH WOULD SEEM TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE IN PRIORITY AND DIGNITY
FOR MY FATHER WAS THERE I SPED FOR THE MANSE BUT AS I APPROACHED IT A NEW APPREHENSION LAID HOLD OF MY TREMBLING HEART I WAS NOT SURE BUT I THOUGHT THE DOOR WAS ALWAYS LOCKED AT NIGHT
MY IDEA OF HIM WAS NOT LIKE HIM IT WAS MERELY A CONFUSED MIXTURE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FANCIES ABOUT HIM AND MY OWN I HAD NOT LEARNED HOW BEAUTIFUL GOD IS
BUT WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS THE PERFECT GOOD THEREFORE TRUE HAPPINESS MUST DWELL IN THE SUPREME DEITY I ACCEPT THY REASONINGS SAID I
AND FORTHWITH LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND SANG
MY HEART SANK TOTALLY WITHIN ME I COULD BEAR NO MORE I FELL DOWN ON THE BED WEEPING BITTERLY AND WEPT MYSELF ASLEEP
METHINKS I SHOULD NEXT SHOW IN WHAT MANNER THIS PERFECTION OF FELICITY IS BUILT UP AND HERE I CONCEIVE IT PROPER TO INQUIRE FIRST WHETHER ANY EXCELLENCE SUCH AS THOU HAST LATELY DEFINED
ALL THESE HOWEVER HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE THE SAME THEREFORE THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MEMBERS OTHERWISE HAPPINESS WILL SEEM TO BE BUILT UP OUT OF ONE MEMBER WHICH CANNOT BE
HE PREFERS A MEAN AND LOW ESTATE AND ALSO DENIES HIMSELF MANY PLEASURES DEAR TO NATURE TO AVOID LOSING THE MONEY WHICH HE HAS GAINED BUT AT THIS RATE HE DOES NOT EVEN ATTAIN TO INDEPENDENCE
AND SO COMES TO APPEAR SOMEWHAT POOR IN ESTEEM I CANNOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING WHAT IT IS THIS UNION OF QUALITIES IS ALSO RIGHT FAMOUS IT FOLLOWS THEN
THIS ALSO IS NECESSARY THAT INDEPENDENCE POWER RENOWN REVERENCE AND SWEETNESS OF DELIGHT ARE DIFFERENT ONLY IN NAME BUT IN SUBSTANCE DIFFER NO WISE ONE FROM THE OTHER
OR WEIGHT OF WATERS WHELM THE EARTH THOU JOINEST AND DIFFUSEST THROUGH THE WHOLE LINKING ACCORDANTLY ITS SEVERAL PARTS A SOUL OF THREEFOLD NATURE MOVING ALL
OVER WHOSE DEFEAT HOWEVER I REJOICED WITH THE PRIDE OF A DRAGON SLAYER
OF GLORY OR OF PLEASURE FOR SINCE EACH ONE OF THESE SEVERALLY IS IDENTICAL WITH THE REST WHOSOEVER SEEKS ANY ONE OF THEM WITHOUT THE OTHERS
FOUND ME FAST ASLEEP ON HIS SO FAST THAT HE UNDRESSED ME AND LAID ME IN THE BED WITHOUT MY ONCE OPENING MY EYES THE MORE STRANGE AS I HAD ALREADY SLEPT SO LONG BUT SORROW IS VERY SLEEPY
THAT WE MUST ADMIT THAT RENOWN IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER THREE IT DOES SAID I THAT THEN WHICH NEEDS NOTHING OUTSIDE ITSELF WHICH CAN ACCOMPLISH ALL THINGS IN ITS OWN STRENGTH
CERTAINLY NOT RIGHT FOR IF THERE IS ANY FEEBLENESS OF STRENGTH IN ANYTHING IN THIS THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE NEED OF EXTERNAL PROTECTION THAT IS SO ACCORDINGLY
BETWEEN THEIR TOPS I SAW ONLY STARS AND DARKNESS I TURNED AND LOOKED BACK INTO THE BARN IT APPEARED A HORRIBLE CAVE FILLED WITH DARKNESS I REMEMBERED THERE WERE RATS IN IT
A WEAKLING VOID OF STRENGTH VEXED BY DISTRESSES MEAN AND DESPISED AND BURIED IN OBSCURITY HE AGAIN WHO THIRSTS ALONE FOR POWER SQUANDERS HIS WEALTH
SHOULD BE GODS BY PARTICIPATION IN THAT NATURE A FAIR CONCLUSION AND A PRECIOUS SAID I DEDUCTION OR COROLLARY BY WHICHEVER NAME THOU WILT CALL IT AND YET SAID SHE
HOW ANY SADNESS CAN FIND ENTRANCE INTO SUCH A STATE WHEREFORE I MUST NEEDS ACKNOWLEDGE IT FULL OF JOY AT LEAST IF OUR FORMER CONCLUSIONS ARE TO HOLD THEN FOR THE SAME REASONS
HERE SHALL BE YOUR LABOUR'S CLOSE HERE YOUR HAVEN OF REPOSE COME TO YOUR ONE REFUGE PRESS WIDE IT STANDS TO ALL DISTRESS
THE NATURE OF INDEPENDENCE AND POWER IS ONE AND THE SAME IT SEEMS SO WELL BUT DOST THINK THAT ANYTHING OF SUCH A NATURE AS THIS CAN BE LOOKED UPON WITH CONTEMPT
WE JUDGE HAPPINESS TO BE GOOD DO WE NOT YEA THE SUPREME GOOD AND THIS SUPERLATIVE APPLIES TO ALL FOR THIS SAME HAPPINESS IS ADJUDGED TO BE THE COMPLETEST INDEPENDENCE
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT SAID I BUT I AM IMPATIENT TO HEAR WHAT REMAINS WHY IT IS MANIFEST THAT ALL THE OTHERS ARE RELATIVE TO THE GOOD
IT IS MANIFEST THAT THEY BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF GODSHIP BUT AS BY THE ACQUISITION OF JUSTICE MEN BECOME JUST AND WISE BY THE ACQUISITION OF WISDOM
SINCE NOW THOU HAST SEEN WHAT IS THE FORM OF THE IMPERFECT GOOD AND WHAT THE FORM OF THE PERFECT ALSO
OR IS THERE SOME ONE OF THEM WHICH FORMS THE FULL ESSENCE OF HAPPINESS WHILE ALL THE REST ARE RELATIVE TO THIS I WOULD THOU WOULDST UNFOLD THE WHOLE MATTER TO ME AT LARGE
THOU WILT STRAIGHTWAY SEE THE TRUE HAPPINESS I PROMISED
FOUND THAT THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN I HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GETTING HUNGRY I WENT OUT AT THE OTHER DOOR INTO THE CLOSE OR FARMYARD AND RAN ACROSS TO THE HOUSE NO ONE WAS THERE
AND DOWN THEIR EYELIDS WINKED AND WINKED AND THEIR CHEEKS PUCKERED AND RELAXED INCESSANTLY THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE STORM OF EXPRESSION UPON THEIR FACES THEIR VERY NOSES TWISTED AND CURLED
I TUMBLED AT ONE OF THE DOORS RATHER THAN RAN TO IT I FOUND IT FAST
NO VOICE CAME IN REPLY AND THE PLACE WAS YET MORE SILENT THAN THE NIGHT OR THE HALL HE MUST BE ASLEEP I WAS AFRAID TO CALL LOUDER
AND THE DESOLATION OF THIS NIGHT WAS MY KEY TO THAT DREAM ONCE MORE I AWOKE TO A SENSE OF MISERY AND STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS CRYING PAPA PAPA THE SAME MOMENT I FOUND MY FATHER'S ARMS AROUND ME
LIKE PHOSPHORESCENT SPARKS IN THE SEA FOAM
SOMETHING MOVED ME TO CLIMB ON THE FORM AND LOOK OUT OF A LITTLE WINDOW FROM WHICH I COULD SEE THE MANSE AND THE ROAD FROM IT TO MY DISMAY THERE WAS MISSUS MITCHELL COMING TOWARDS THE FARM
NEARLY UNDER IT WAS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN CREEPING ROUND BY THE NORTH TOWARDS THE SPOT IN THE EAST WHERE HE WOULD RISE AGAIN
WHICH ON ANOTHER SIDE BOUNDED THE CORN YARD THERE WAS THE MOON CRESCENT AS I SAW HER IN MY DREAM BUT LOW DOWN TOWARDS THE HORIZON AND LYING ALMOST UPON HER ROUNDED BACK SHE LOOKED VERY DISCONSOLATE AND DIM
IT IS NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GOD IS VERY HAPPINESS YES SAID I I CANNOT GAINSAY MY FORMER ADMISSIONS AND I SEE CLEARLY THAT THIS IS A NECESSARY INFERENCE THEREFROM
IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED BUT THERE IS ALSO A HAPPINESS SUBSTANTIAL AND PERFECT MOST TRUE IS THY CONCLUSION AND MOST SURE SAID I NEXT
I WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED AT FIRST AND FELT AS IF I WERE BEING SLOWLY STIFLED
IN ITS OWN ESSENCE THE HIGHEST GOOD AND MOST JUSTLY SAID I BUT THE HIGHEST GOOD HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO BE HAPPINESS YES THEN SAID SHE
AND SHINE IN THINE OWN SPLENDOUR
I GAZED AT THAT PALE FADED LIGHT AND ALL AT ONCE I REMEMBERED THAT GOD WAS NEAR ME BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT GOD IS THEN AS I KNOW NOW AND WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM THEN WHICH WAS NEITHER MUCH NOR OFTEN
I POSSESSED MY WITS SUFFICIENTLY TO RUN FIRST TO KIRSTY'S PRESS AND SECURE A GOOD SUPPLY OF OATCAKE WITH WHICH I THEN SPED LIKE A HUNTED HARE TO HER FORM
IT IS UTTERLY INCONCEIVABLE HOW THAT SO CALLED IM PERFECTION SHOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE NATURE DOES NOT MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THINGS MUTILATED AND IMPERFECT
WERE ALL THESE MEMBERS COMPOSING HAPPINESS THEY WOULD DIFFER SEVERALLY ONE FROM THE OTHER FOR THIS IS THE NATURE OF PARTS
EVERYBODY BESIDES ME WAS ASLEEP ALL OVER THE WORLD AND HAD ABANDONED ME TO MY FATE WHATEVER MIGHT COME OUT OF THE DARKNESS TO SEIZE ME WHEN I GOT ROUND THE EDGE OF THE STONE WALL
ABOVE IT SHONE THE SPEECHLESS STARS NOTHING WAS ALIVE NOTHING WOULD SPEAK I WENT UP THE FEW ROUGH HEWN GRANITE
NOT AS MEN CONVERSE BUT BOTH AT ONCE YET EACH LISTENING WHILE EACH SPOKE I HEARD NO WORD BUT THEIR LIPS MOVED MOST BUSILY THEIR EYEBROWS WENT UP
MY FATHER'S HAD BEEN GREATER THAN MINE WHILE I STOOD FORSAKEN AND DESOLATE IN THE FIELD THEY HAD BEEN SEARCHING ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER BUT THE HERD HAD HAD AN IDEA AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY SEARCHED THE BARN AND EVERY PLACE THEY COULD THINK OF
TO CONSIDER WHERE THE DWELLING PLACE OF THIS HAPPINESS MAY BE THE COMMON BELIEF OF ALL MANKIND AGREES THAT GOD THE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS IS GOOD FOR SINCE NOTHING CAN BE IMAGINED BETTER THAN GOD
IS ONE AND THE SAME I CANNOT SEE HOW ANYONE CAN DISSENT FROM THESE CONCLUSIONS
I CLIMBED UP ON THE BED I FELT ALL ACROSS IT UTTER DESERTION SEIZED MY SOUL MY FATHER WAS NOT THERE WAS IT A HORRIBLE DREAM SHOULD I EVER AWAKE
CLEARLY CANNOT BE SEVERALLY EACH WHAT THE OTHER IS WHEREFORE NEITHER OF THE TWO CAN BE PERFECT SINCE TO EITHER THE OTHER IS WANTING
CANNOT BE IDENTICAL THEREFORE THAT WHICH OF ITS OWN NATURE IS DISTINCT FROM THE HIGHEST GOOD IS NOT ITSELF THE HIGHEST GOOD AN IMPIOUS THOUGHT OF HIM THAN WHOM TIS PLAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE EXCELLENT
FOR UNIVERSALLY NOTHING CAN BE BETTER IN NATURE THAN THE SOURCE FROM WHICH IT HAS COME THEREFORE ON MOST TRUE GROUNDS OF REASON WOULD I CONCLUDE THAT WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS TO BE
THAT WHICH CAN TRULY BESTOW ONE OF THEM I KNOW TO BE WITHOUT DOUBT FULL AND COMPLETE HAPPINESS HAPPY ART THOU MY SCHOLAR IN THIS THY CONVICTION ONLY ONE THING SHOULDST THOU ADD
I WAS IN DARKNESS BUT NOT IN MY OWN BED WHEN I PROCEEDED TO TURN I FOUND MYSELF HEMMED IN ON ALL SIDES I COULD NOT STRETCH MY ARMS AND THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM FOR MY BODY BETWEEN MY FEET AND MY HEAD
HITHER COME ALL YE WHOSE MINDS LUST WITH ROSY FETTERS BINDS LUST TO BONDAGE HARD COMPELLING
BY NO MEANS THEN CAN GOODS WHICH ARE SUPREME BE DIFFERENT ONE FROM THE OTHER BUT WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH HAPPINESS AND GOD ARE THE SUPREME GOOD WHEREFORE THAT WHICH IS HIGHEST DIVINITY
BUT DEEP SET WITHIN THY INMOST BEING THE FORM OF PERFECT GOOD FROM ENVY FREE AND THOU DIDST MOULD THE WHOLE TO THAT SUPERNAL PATTERN BEAUTEOUS THE WORLD IN THEE THUS IMAGED
CAN EXIST IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LEST WE BE DECEIVED BY AN EMPTY FICTION OF THOUGHT TO WHICH NO TRUE REALITY ANSWERS
EVEN THINGS WHICH BY NATURE ARE NOT GOOD ARE DESIRED AS IF THEY WERE TRULY GOOD IF THEY SEEM TO BE SO
OF THE HIGHEST GOOD IN WHAT WAY PRAY SAID I DO NOT RASHLY SUPPOSE THAT HE WHO IS THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS HATH RECEIVED THAT HIGHEST GOOD OF WHICH HE IS SAID TO BE POSSESSED EITHER FROM SOME EXTERNAL SOURCE
ALONE THERE LAY THE AWFULNESS OF IT I HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN WHAT THE NIGHT WAS THE REAL STING OF ITS FEAR LAY IN THIS THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE IN IT
AND CONCLUDE THESE THREE TO BE ONE WE MUST IF WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH THINKEST THOU THEN THIS COMBINATION OF QUALITIES TO BE OBSCURE AND WITHOUT DISTINCTION
THAT GOD AND TRUE HAPPINESS ARE ONE AND THE SAME YES SAID I THEN WE CAN SAFELY CONCLUDE ALSO THAT GOD'S ESSENCE IS SEATED IN ABSOLUTE GOOD AND NOWHERE ELSE
ON AN AXIS AND THE MOON THEREUPON SHOOK HERSELF IN RESPONSE THEN THEY NODDED TO EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT IS ENTIRELY MY OWN OPINION AT LAST THEY BEGAN TO TALK
OR RATHER FAMOUS IN ALL RENOWN JUST CONSIDER CAN THAT WANT RENOWN WHICH HAS BEEN AGREED TO BE LACKING IN NOTHING TO BE SUPREME IN POWER
IT IS SAID I THIS THEN WHICH IS ONE AND SIMPLE BY NATURE HUMAN PERVERSITY SEPARATES AND IN TRYING TO WIN A PART OF THAT WHICH HAS NO PARTS
AND MUST PUNISH THEM TO MAKE THEM GOOD WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM NOW IN THE SILENT STARRY NIGHT A YET GREATER TERROR SEIZED ME AND I RAN STUMBLING OVER THE UNEVEN FIELD DOES MY READER
BUT THEY RATHER LEAVE THE MIND IN ITS NATIVE DARKNESS BLIND FOR THE FAIREST BEAMS THEY SHED IN EARTH'S LOWEST DEPTHS WERE FED BUT THE SPLENDOUR THAT SUPPLIES STRENGTH AND VIGOUR TO THE SKIES
IF I HAD HAD ONE LIVING CREATURE NIGH ME IF ONLY THE STUPID CALF WHOSE DULL SLEEPY LOW STARTLED ME SO DREADFULLY AS I STOOD STARING ABOUT ME

THAT WHICH IS SIMPLE AND INDIVISIBLE BY NATURE HUMAN ERROR SEPARATES AND TRANSFORMS FROM THE TRUE AND PERFECT TO THE FALSE AND IMPERFECT DOST THOU IMAGINE THAT WHICH LACKETH NOTHING CAN WANT POWER
I HAD SOON DRAWN THE STOPPER OF STRAW INTO THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE WHERE HEARING NO ONE APPROACH I BEGAN TO EAT MY OATCAKE AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN BEFORE I HAD FINISHED
NO CONCLUSION COULD BE MORE TRUE SO THEN THE FORM AND THE CAUSES OF FALSE HAPPINESS ARE SET BEFORE THINE EYES NOW TURN THY GAZE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE
AND GOT OUT INTO THE OPEN FIELD
THIS CLEFT IN TWAIN AND IN TWO CIRCLES GATHERED SPEEDS IN A PATH THAT ON ITSELF RETURNS ENCOMPASSING MIND'S LIMITS AND CONFORMS THE HEAVENS TO HER TRUE SEMBLANCE
WE MUST INVOKE THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS SAID I FOR WITHOUT THIS NO ENTERPRISE SETS OUT FROM A RIGHT BEGINNING
I RECALLED THE HORRIBLE SCHOOL
TO ALL THAT MOVES THE SOURCE OF MOVEMENT FIXED THYSELF AND MOVELESS THEE NO CAUSE IMPELLED EXTRINSIC THIS PROPORTIONED FRAME TO SHAPE FROM SHAPELESS MATTER
SINCE WE ARE SPEAKING OF GOD WHO IS SUPREME OF ALL THINGS WHO WAS THERE TO JOIN THESE DISTINCT ESSENCES FINALLY WHEN ONE THING IS DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER THE THINGS SO CONCEIVED AS DISTINCT
GOOD THEN IS THE SUM AND SOURCE OF ALL DESIRABLE THINGS THAT WHICH HAS NOT IN ITSELF ANY GOOD EITHER IN REALITY OR IN SEMBLANCE CAN IN NO WISE BE DESIRED CONTRARIWISE
WHICH I COULD DRAW BACK THE OPEN DOOR REVEALED THE DARK NIGHT BEFORE ME WAS THE CORNYARD AS WE CALLED IT FULL OF RICKS HUGE AND VERY POSITIVE ALTHOUGH DIM THEY ROSE BETWIXT ME AND THE SKY
AND THIS THOU HAST SO AMPLY DEMONSTRATED THAT NO WORD MORE IS NEEDED WELL THEN THESE THINGS SEEM TO GIVE TO MORTALS SHADOWS OF THE TRUE GOOD OR SOME KIND OF IMPERFECT GOOD
TIS PLAIN TO THE BLIND SAID I THOU DIDST POINT IT OUT EVEN NOW IN SEEKING TO UNFOLD THE CAUSES OF THE FALSE
THE STARS WERE HIGH UP AWAY IN THE HEAVENS THEY DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN AND MOON AT ALL AND THEY TOOK NO HEED OF ME YET THERE WAS A GRANDEUR IN MY DESOLATION THAT WOULD HAVE ELEVATED MY HEART BUT FOR THE FEAR
SO BY PARITY OF REASONING BY ACQUIRING GODSHIP THEY MUST OF NECESSITY BECOME GODS SO EVERY MAN WHO IS HAPPY IS A GOD AND THOUGH IN NATURE GOD IS ONE ONLY YET THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THAT VERY MANY
I STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO FEEL FOR HIM
WONDER WHITHER I FLED WHITHER SHOULD I FLY BUT HOME TRUE MISSUS MITCHELL WAS THERE BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER THERE AS WELL EVEN KIRSTY WOULD NOT DO IN THIS TERROR HOME WAS THE ONLY REFUGE
I DREW NEARER THE PLACE OF POSSIBLE REFUGE ROSE BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE GRASS PLOT IN FRONT OF IT THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN ITS EYES ITS MOUTH WAS CLOSED IT WAS SILENT AS ONE OF THE RICKS
OR IS IT RATHER OF ALL THINGS MOST WORTHY OF VENERATION NAY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT LET US THEN ADD REVERENCE TO INDEPENDENCE AND POWER
WE OUGHT EVEN IN THE MOST TRIVIAL MATTERS TO IMPLORE THE DIVINE PROTECTION WHAT THINKEST THOU SHOULD WE NOW DO IN ORDER TO DESERVE TO FIND THE SEAT OF THAT HIGHEST GOOD
BUT WHAT WAS MY DISMAY TO FIND THAT EVEN WHEN MY HAND WENT OUT INTO SPACE NO LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE OPENING WHAT COULD IT MEAN SURELY I HAD NOT GROWN BLIND WHILE I LAY ASLEEP
I CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME AND ALMOST SICK WITH THE MISERY OF A BEING WHERE NO OTHER BEING WAS TO COMFORT IT I GROPED MY WAY TO MY FATHER'S ROOM WHEN I ONCE HAD MY HAND ON HIS DOOR
SO IT COMES TO PASS THAT WHENEVER IMPERFECTION IS FOUND IN ANY PARTICULAR THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE A PERFECTION IN RESPECT OF THAT PARTICULAR ALSO FOR WERE THERE NO SUCH PERFECTION
BEING THYSELF MOST BEAUTIFUL SO THOU THE WORK DIDST FASHION IN THAT FAIR LIKENESS BIDDING IT PUT ON PERFECTION THROUGH THE EXQUISITE PERFECTNESS OF EVERY PART'S CONTRIVANCE
AS THE BENEFIT OF HIS HEALTH SINCE THEN ALL THINGS ARE SOUGHT FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD IT IS NOT THESE SO MUCH AS GOOD ITSELF THAT IS SOUGHT BY ALL
IT NOW REMAINS THAT THOU SHOULDST LEARN FROM WHAT SOURCE TO SEEK THIS YES TO THIS I HAVE LONG BEEN EAGERLY LOOKING FORWARD WELL SINCE AS PLATO MAINTAINS IN THE TIMAEUS
EACH TO ITS STARRY CAR AFFIXING
TO WHICH THEY GIVE THE NAME DEDUCTIONS SO WILL I ADD HERE A SORT OF COROLLARY FOR SINCE MEN BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF HAPPINESS WHILE HAPPINESS IS VERY GODSHIP
SHE STARTS WITH WHAT IS WHOLE AND PERFECT AND FALLS AWAY LATER TO THESE FEEBLE AND INFERIOR PRODUCTIONS SO IF THERE IS AS WE SHOWED BEFORE A HAPPINESS OF A FRAIL AND IMPERFECT KIND
AND THINKS FAME AND RANK ALIKE WORTHLESS WITHOUT POWER BUT THOU SEEST IN HOW MANY WAYS HIS STATE ALSO IS DEFECTIVE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS THAT HE LACKS NECESSARIES
EVEN TO GO OUT AT THE OPPOSITE DOOR I FORGOT HOW SOUNDLY AND PEACEFULLY I HAD SLEPT IN IT I STEPPED OUT INTO THE NIGHT WITH THE GRASS OF THE CORN YARD UNDER MY FEET
WHAT IS THAT SAID I IS THERE AUGHT THINKEST THOU AMID THESE MORTAL AND PERISHABLE THINGS WHICH CAN PRODUCE A STATE SUCH AS THIS NAY SURELY NOT
THE HIGHEST POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND PLEASURE WHAT THEN ARE ALL THESE GOODS INDEPENDENCE POWER AND THE REST TO BE DEEMED MEMBERS OF HAPPINESS AS IT WERE
NOW THAT FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH ANYTHING IS DESIRED ITSELF SEEMS TO BE MOST WISHED FOR FOR INSTANCE IF ANYONE WISHES TO RIDE FOR THE SAKE OF HEALTH HE DOES NOT SO MUCH WISH FOR THE EXERCISE OF RIDING
AND THE UNIVERSE CONTROLS
AND FROM THE WOOD WAS BORNE TOWARDS THEM THE SOUNDS OF THE UNKNOWN BELL WITH WONDERFUL DISTINCTNESS THEY ALL IMMEDIATELY FELT A WISH TO GO THITHER ALL EXCEPT THREE ONE OF THEM HAD TO GO HOME TO TRY ON A BALL DRESS
THE RED COLORS ABOVE FADED AWAY AS THE SUN VANISHED BUT A MILLION STARS WERE LIGHTED A MILLION LAMPS SHONE
BUT A HELPLESS QUADRUPED HAS NOT THOUGH IF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THESE BATS ATTACKED A MAN AT THE SAME TIME HE WOULD HAVE SMALL CHANCE TO ESCAPE ALIVE THEIR BITES TOO MAY BE POISONOUS FOR ALL I KNOW
SAW A WEIRD SIGHT CIRCLING AND WHEELING ABOUT IN THE CAMP CLEARING WERE MANY OF THE BLACK SHADOWY FORMS THAT HAD CAUSED NED SUCH ALARM GREAT BATS THEY WERE AND A DANGEROUS SPECIES IF JACINTO WAS TO BE BELIEVED
AND GIVE ANOTHER TO THE OLD WATERMAN HE LEFT DIAMOND ON THE BOX A SUDDEN NOISE GOT UP AND DIAMOND LOOKED ROUND TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
BUT TWO OF THE YOUNGEST SOON GREW TIRED AND BOTH RETURNED TO TOWN TWO LITTLE GIRLS SAT DOWN AND TWINED GARLANDS SO THEY DID NOT GO EITHER AND WHEN THE OTHERS REACHED THE WILLOW TREE WHERE THE CONFECTIONER WAS THEY SAID NOW WE ARE THERE
BUT IT HAD SEEMED TO THEM AS IF IT HAD COME FROM THE TOWN
NOTHING ELSE OF MOMENT MARKED THE REMAINDER OF THE RIVER JOURNEY AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD DAY THE CANOES PULLED TO SHORE AND A NIGHT CAMP WAS MADE BUT WHERE ARE THE MULES WE ARE TO USE IN TRAVELING TO MORROW ASKED THE PROFESSOR OF JACINTO IN THE NEXT VILLAGE
COME BACK AGAIN CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SKIN I HOPE NOT I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BATS AND MOSQUITOES HE ADDED AS HE SLAPPED AT HIS FACE AND NECK INDEED THE PARTY OF WHITES WERE SET UPON BY THE NIGHT INSECTS TO SUCH AN EXTENT
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD GOT A CAB WELL YOU SEE MA'AM I HAD A CHANCE OF BUYING THE OLD HORSE AND I COULDN'T RESIST HIM
TOM AND NED KICKED OUTSIDE THE BAT THE FORMER HAD KILLED IN THEIR TENT AND THEN BOTH WENT BACK TO THEIR COTS BUT IT WAS SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE THEY FELL ASLEEP AND THEY DID NOT HAVE MUCH TIME TO REST
WHAT IS IT WHAT'S THE MATTER CRIED TOM SPRINGING FROM HIS COT AND HASTENING TO THE SIDE OF HIS CHUM IN THE TENT
ALL THE TIME THE OLD HORSE WENT ON EATING HIS HAY AND BUT WITH AN OCCASIONAL WHISK OF HIS TAIL WHEN DIAMOND TICKLED OR SCRATCHED HIM TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE PROCEEDING BUT THAT WAS ALL A PRETENCE FOR HE KNEW VERY WELL WHO IT WAS THAT WAS PERCHED ON HIS BACK AND RUBBING AWAY AT HIM WITH THE COMB AND THE BRUSH
I DO NOT THINK THIS LOT WILL COME BACK WE HAVE KILLED TOO MANY OF THEM
SHOULD HAVE THE TITLE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER EVEN IF IT WERE NOT REALLY A BELL MANY PERSONS NOW WENT TO THE WOOD FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE PLACE
HERE YOU HAVE A LIGHT LIKE MINE FLASH IT ON AND HANG IT SOMEWHERE ON YOURSELF THEN GET A CLUB AND COME ON THE LIGHTS WILL BLIND THE BATS AND WE CAN SEE TO HIT EM TOM'S PLAN SEEMED TO BE A GOOD ONE HIS LAMP AND NED'S HAD SMALL HOOKS ON THEM
I WILL CLIMB UP YONDER ROCK AND HE SEIZED HOLD OF THE CREEPING PLANTS AND THE ROOTS OF TREES CLIMBED UP THE MOIST STONES WHERE THE WATER SNAKES WERE WRITHING AND THE TOADS WERE CROAKING
AND SAID THE BELL SOUNDED LIKE THE VOICE OF A MOTHER TO A GOOD DEAR CHILD AND THAT NO MELODY WAS SWEETER THAN THE TONES OF THE BELL THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO OBSERVANT OF IT AND VOWED THAT HE WHO COULD DISCOVER WHENCE THE SOUNDS PROCEEDED
THE BATS FLEW BACK TO THE JUNGLE WHENCE THEY HAD EMERGED WE ARE SAFE FOR THE PRESENT EXCLAIMED JACINTO WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
ONE DAY JACK GAVE HIM A CURRY COMB AND A BRUSH TO TRY HIS HAND UPON OLD DIAMOND'S COAT HE USED THEM SO DEFTLY SO GENTLY AND YET SO THOROUGHLY AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH THAT THE MAN COULD NOT HELP ADMIRING HIM YOU MUST MAKE HASTE AND GROW HE SAID
THIS HE HAD DONE AND WAS NOW GOING ON IN WOODEN SHOES AND IN HIS HUMBLE DRESS FOR THE BELL SOUNDED WITH SO DEEP A TONE AND WITH SUCH STRANGE POWER THAT PROCEED HE MUST
I SEE OBSERVED TOM CALMLY HAND ME THE RIFLE NED TOM TOOK QUICK AIM AND PULLED THE TRIGGER THE EXPLOSIVE ELECTRIC BULLET WENT TRUE TO ITS MARK AND THE GREAT ANIMAL TURNED OVER IN A DEATH STRUGGLE
FOR ONE THING HE NEVER GOT FRIGHTENED AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS NEVER IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YET WHEN THE MOMENT CAME FOR DOING SOMETHING SHARP HE WAS ALWAYS READY FOR IT I MUST ONCE MORE REMIND MY READERS THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
IT WON'T DO TO HAVE A HORSE'S BELLY CLEAN AND HIS BACK DIRTY YOU KNOW GIVE ME A LEG SAID DIAMOND AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS ON THE OLD HORSE'S BACK WITH THE COMB AND BRUSH HE SAT ON HIS WITHERS AND REACHING FORWARD AS HE ATE HIS HAY
FROM CHILDREN THEY BECOME ALL AT ONCE GROWN UP PERSONS IT WAS AS IF THEIR INFANT SOULS WERE NOW TO FLY ALL AT ONCE INTO PERSONS WITH MORE UNDERSTANDING THE SUN WAS SHINING GLORIOUSLY THE CHILDREN THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WENT OUT OF THE TOWN
A BOY IN WOODEN SHOES AND WITH SO SHORT A JACKET THAT ONE COULD SEE WHAT LONG WRISTS HE HAD BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THE BOY WAS THAT ONE AMONG THE CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT COME BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO HOME AND RETURN HIS JACKET AND BOOTS TO THE INNKEEPER'S SON
THEY WERE JUST CLEARING THE RUBBISH AWAY DIAMOND'S FATHER TURNED AND MADE FOR CHARING CROSS THAT NIGHT THE FATHER AND MOTHER HAD A GREAT DEAL TO TALK ABOUT POOR THINGS SAID THE MOTHER IT'S WORSE FOR THEM THAN IT IS FOR US
AND SHE CAN'T BEAR THE MOTION OF THE OMNIBUSES INDEED WE MEANT TO WALK A BIT FIRST BEFORE WE TOOK A CAB BUT JUST AT THE CORNER FOR AS HOT AS THE SUN WAS A COLD WIND CAME DOWN THE STREET AND I SAW THAT MISS COLEMAN MUST NOT FACE IT
FINALLY THE SCIENTIST SAID OH YES WE MAY FIND AN IDOL I UNDERSTAND THE ANCIENT PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE LONG BEFORE THE SPANIARDS CAME WORSHIPED IDOLS BUT WE SHALL TAKE WHATEVER ANTIQUITIES WE FIND HUH GRUNTED JACINTO
APPEARED IN HIS WOODEN SHOES AND JACKET THE POOR BOY WHO HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WITH HIM HE HAD FOLLOWED HIS OWN PATH AND HAD REACHED THE SPOT JUST AS SOON AS THE SON OF THE KING HAD DONE THEY RAN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND STOOD TOGETHER HAND IN HAND
LIKE A PRIMROSE IN A HAILSTORM AT FIRST BECAUSE HIS FACE WAS SO QUIET AND SWEET WITH A SMILE ALWAYS EITHER AWAKE OR ASLEEP IN HIS EYES AND BECAUSE HE NEVER HEEDED THEIR UGLY WORDS AND ROUGH JOKES THEY SAID HE WASN'T ALL THERE
AND THE WORDS CHOKED THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY GOT ANY FARTHER WHEN THEY TALKED TO HIM NICELY HE HAD ALWAYS A GOOD ANSWER SOMETIMES A SMART ONE READY AND THAT HELPED MUCH TO MAKE THEM CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT HIM
BUT THE DEEP SOUND OF THE BELL ROSE LOUDER IT WAS ALMOST AS IF AN ORGAN WERE ACCOMPANYING IT AND THE TONES CAME FROM THE LEFT HAND THE SIDE WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED A RUSTLING WAS HEARD IN THE BUSHES AND A LITTLE BOY STOOD BEFORE THE KING'S SON
WHEN THEY REACHED THE CURBSTONE WHO SHOULD IT BE WAITING FOR THE CAB BUT MISSUS AND MISS COLEMAN THEY DID NOT LOOK AT THE CABMAN HOWEVER
YOU SEE THEY'VE BEEN USED TO SUCH GRAND THINGS AND FOR THEM TO COME DOWN TO A LITTLE POKY HOUSE LIKE THAT IT BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK OF IT I DON'T KNOW SAID DIAMOND THOUGHTFULLY WHETHER MISSUS COLEMAN HAD BELLS ON HER TOES
I DON'T KNOW BUT JACINTO IS YELLING SOMETHING ABOUT VAMPIRES VAMPIRES
AS IF IT WOULD SHOWER DOWN ALL ITS BLESSINGS ON THE ROOF WHERE ROSES WERE BLOOMING THE LONG STEMS TWINED ROUND THE GABLE ON WHICH THERE HUNG A SMALL BELL WAS IT THAT WHICH PEOPLE HAD HEARD YES EVERYBODY WAS UNANIMOUS ON THE SUBJECT EXCEPT ONE
HE GOT HOLD OF THE BROOM AT HER END AND PULLED ALONG WITH HER BUT THE BOYS PROCEEDED TO ROUGHER MEASURES
AND FANCIED THEY WERE NOW IN THE DEPTH OF THE GREEN WOOD THE CONFECTIONER OF THE TOWN CAME OUT AND SET UP HIS BOOTH THERE AND SOON AFTER CAME ANOTHER CONFECTIONER
WHERE THE DEER WERE PLAYING IN THE GRASS GREW MAGNIFICENT OAKS AND BEECHES AND IF THE BARK OF ONE OF THE TREES WAS CRACKED THERE GRASS AND LONG CREEPING PLANTS GREW IN THE CREVICES AND THERE WERE LARGE CALM LAKES THERE TOO
HAVE YOU THOUGHT WHAT MAY BE IN THEM GREAT HEATHEN TEMPLES IDOLS PERHAPS FOR A MOMENT NONE OF THE PROFESSOR'S COMPANIONS SPOKE
FOR IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT ANY OLD HORSE IS THINKING OH DEAR SAID DIAMOND WHEN HE HAD DONE I'M SO TIRED AND HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AT FULL LENGTH ON OLD DIAMOND'S BACK BY THIS TIME ALL THE MEN IN THE STABLE WERE GATHERED ABOUT THE TWO DIAMONDS AND ALL MUCH AMUSED
CAN KILL A HORSE OR AN OX IN A SHORT TIME BY SUCKING ITS BLOOD SO WHEN THE VILLAGERS FIND THEY ARE VISITED BY A COLONY OF THESE VAMPIRES THEY GET OUT TAKING THEIR LIVE STOCK WITH THEM AND STAY IN CAVES OR IN DENSELY WOODED PLACES UNTIL THE BATS FLY ON
SOME ROUGH YOUNG IMPS HAD PICKED A QUARREL WITH HER AND WERE NOW HAULING AT HER BROOM TO GET IT AWAY FROM HER BUT AS THEY DID NOT PULL ALL TOGETHER SHE WAS HOLDING IT AGAINST THEM SCOLDING AND ENTREATING ALTERNATELY DIAMOND WAS OFF HIS BOX IN A MOMENT AND RUNNING TO THE HELP OF THE GIRL
FOR THE ROLLING OF THE CARRIAGES AND THE VOICES OF THE MULTITUDE MADE TOO GREAT A NOISE
WHY JOSEPH CAN IT BE YOU YES MA'AM YES MISS ANSWERED HE AGAIN TOUCHING HIS HAT WITH ALL THE RESPECT HE COULD POSSIBLY PUT INTO THE ACTION IT'S A LUCKY DAY WHICH I SEE YOU ONCE MORE UPON IT WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SAID MISSUS COLEMAN
AND SPOILT ONES TOO MISSUS COLEMAN IS NONE SO POOR AS ALL THAT YET NO THANK HEAVEN SHE'S NOT COME TO THAT IS IT A GREAT DISGRACE TO BE POOR ASKED DIAMOND BECAUSE OF THE TONE IN WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SPOKEN
NOBODY KNOWS THE SENSE IN THAT HEAD OF HIS THE TWO LADIES WENT NEAR TO PAT THE HORSE AND THEN THEY NOTICED DIAMOND ON THE BOX WHY YOU'VE GOT BOTH DIAMONDS WITH YOU SAID MISS COLEMAN HOW DO YOU DO DIAMOND DIAMOND LIFTED HIS CAP AND ANSWERED POLITELY
WOODROOF AND ANEMONIES GREW ALMOST TOO HIGH BLOOMING CONVOLVULUSES AND BLACKBERRY BUSHES HUNG IN LONG GARLANDS FROM TREE TO TREE WHERE THE NIGHTINGALE SANG AND THE SUNBEAMS WERE PLAYING IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS NO PLACE FOR GIRLS TO GO
HE IS THE SON OF A KING BUT ON HE WENT WITHOUT BEING DISHEARTENED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOOD WHERE THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS WERE GROWING THERE STOOD WHITE LILIES WITH BLOOD RED STAMINA
AND DRAGGING HER BROOM AFTER HER AND FROM THAT BY DEGREES HE RECALLED THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN HE GOT DOWN FROM NORTH WIND'S BACK IN A LONDON STREET BUT HE COULD NOT QUITE SATISFY HIMSELF WHETHER THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS NOT A DREAM WHICH HE HAD DREAMED WHEN HE WAS A VERY LITTLE BOY
SHE TOLD THE CABMAN AND AWAY THEY DROVE WHEN THEY REACHED THE HOUSE DIAMOND'S FATHER GOT DOWN AND RANG THE BELL
HE RUSHED IN AND SENT THE ASSAILANTS FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS THE GIRL THANKED DIAMOND AND BEGAN SWEEPING AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED WHILE HIS FATHER LED HIM AWAY WITH THE HELP OF OLD TOM THE WATERMAN HE WAS SOON WASHED INTO DECENCY
HE RECALLED ANOTHER THING THAT HAD HAPPENED THAT MORNING WHICH ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED A MERE ACCIDENT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE
THE INDIANS SEEMED GLAD TO LEAVE THE PLACE OF THE BATS AS THEY CALLED THE CAMP SITE JACINTO EXPLAINED THAT THE INDIANS BELIEVED A VAMPIRE COULD KILL THEM WHILE THEY SLEPT AND THEY WERE VERY MUCH AFRAID OF THE BLOOD SUCKING BATS
THOUGH TO BE SURE SAID DIAMOND'S FATHER WITH WHAT TRUTH I CANNOT SAY BUT HE BELIEVED WHAT HE SAID SOME LADIES IS VERY HARD AND KEEPS YOU TO THE BARE SIXPENCE A MILE WHEN EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT AIN'T ENOUGH TO KEEP A FAMILY AND A CAB UPON TO BE SURE IT'S THE LAW
FROM THEN ON WE TRAVEL BY LAND UNTIL WELL UNTIL YOU GET TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE GOING I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS HE ADDED NODDING TOWARD THE PROFESSOR I AM LEAVING THAT PART TO YOU OH I HAVE A MAP SHOWING WHERE I WANT TO BEGIN SOME EXCAVATIONS WAS THE ANSWER
OH WE'VE GONE THROUGH WITH WORSE THAN THIS LAUGHED TOM IT'S ALL IN THE DAY'S WORK WE'VE ONLY GOT STARTED
FOR NOBODY WENT FAR ENOUGH THAT ONE NOT FURTHER THAN THE OTHERS HOWEVER HE SAID THAT THE SOUND PROCEEDED FROM A VERY LARGE OWL IN A HOLLOW TREE A SORT OF LEARNED OWL THAT CONTINUALLY KNOCKED ITS HEAD AGAINST THE BRANCHES
ALL NATURE WAS A VAST HOLY CHURCH IN WHICH THE TREES AND THE BUOYANT CLOUDS WERE THE PILLARS FLOWERS AND GRASS THE VELVET CARPETING AND HEAVEN ITSELF THE LARGE CUPOLA
THOUGH SEARCH WAS MADE FOR IT THE ACCIDENT CAST A LITTLE DAMPER OVER THE PARTY
THEY MAY THERE IS NO TELLING BLESS MY SPEEDOMETER CRIED MISTER DAMON IF THOSE BEASTS OR BIRDS WHATEVER THEY ARE COME BACK I'LL GO AND HIDE IN THE RIVER AND TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE ALLIGATORS
FROM WITHOUT THE TENT CAME THE INDIAN CRIES OF OSHTOO OSHTOO MINGLED WITH THEM WERE CALLS OF JACINTO PARTLY IN SPANISH PARTLY IN THE INDIAN TONGUE AND PARTLY IN ENGLISH IT IS A RAID BY VAMPIRE BATS WAS ALL TOM AND NED COULD DISTINGUISH
THE UNCANNY CREATURES FLEW IN AND OUT AMONG THE TREES AND TENTS NOW SWOOPING LOW NEAR THE INDIANS OR THE TRAVELERS AT SUCH TIMES CLUBS WOULD BE USED OFTEN WITH THE EFFECT OF KILLING OR STUNNING THE FLYING PESTS
AND IN THE TONE OF VOICE IN WHICH THEY WERE SAID WHICH DIAMOND FELT TO BE UGLY SO THEY DID NOT EVEN STICK TO HIM NOT TO SAY GET INSIDE HIM HE NEVER TOOK ANY NOTICE OF THEM
THEN TOM NOTICED SOMETHING QUEER THE CANOES WERE NOT ON THE RIVER BANK THERE WAS NOT AN INDIAN IN SIGHT AND NO EVIDENCE OF JACINTO WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAVE THE OTHERS GONE ON AHEAD
SO THEY COULD BE CARRIED IN THE UPPER COAT POCKET SHOWING A GLEAM OF LIGHT AND LEAVING THE HANDS FREE FOR USE OUT OF THE TENTS RUSHED THE YOUNG MEN TO FIND PROFESSOR BUMPER AND MISTER DAMON BEFORE THEM THE TWO MEN HAD CLUBS AND WERE STRIKING ABOUT IN THE HALF DARKNESS
IN THE VAST CHURCH OF NATURE AND OF POETRY WHILE OVER THEM SOUNDED THE INVISIBLE HOLY BELL
THOUGH WE HAD HARD ENOUGH WORK IN THAT TUNNEL DIGGING AFTER BREAKFAST WHILE THE INDIANS WERE MAKING READY THE CANOES PROFESSOR BUMPER WHO IN A PREVIOUS VISIT TO CENTRAL AMERICA HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT MADE A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF SOME OF THE DEAD BATS
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN DIAMOND GOES ON DIAMOND BECAME A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH ALL THE MEN ABOUT THE MEWS SOME MAY THINK IT WAS NOT THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR HIM TO BE BROUGHT UP IN BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THERE HE WAS
AND SCRATCHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND FEET TILL THEY BLED THE KING'S SON GOT SOME SCRATCHES TOO BUT THE SUN SHONE ON HIS PATH
THAT'S THE SHADOW LOOK OUT AND HE HELD UP HIS HANDS INSTINCTIVELY TO SHIELD HIS FACE SHADOW YELLED TOM UNCONSCIOUSLY ADDING TO THE DIN THAT SEEMED TO PERVADE EVERY PART OF THE CAMP THAT ISN'T A SHADOW IT'S SUBSTANCE IT'S A MONSTER BAT
AS HE AND TOM AROSE IN THE GRAY DAWN OF THE MORNING WHEN JACINTO ANNOUNCED THE BREAKFAST WHICH THE INDIAN COOK HAD PREPARED THAT WAS SOME NIGHT IF THIS IS A SAMPLE OF THE WILDS OF HONDURAS GIVE ME THE TAMENESS OF SHOPTON
IT'S CHANGED TIMES FOR BOTH OF US JOSEPH AND IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN WE CAN HAVE A CAB EVEN
AT FIRST HE HEARD A GOOD MANY ROUGH AND BAD WORDS BUT HE DID NOT LIKE THEM AND SO THEY DID HIM LITTLE HARM HE DID NOT KNOW IN THE LEAST WHAT THEY MEANT
FOR NOW THE INDIANS HAD SET SEVERAL FIRES AGLOW AND IN THE GLEAMS CONSTANTLY GROWING BRIGHTER AS MORE FUEL WAS PILED ON
THE WATERS SEETHED AND BUBBLED AS THE ALLIGATORS FOUGHT UNDER IT FOR POSSESSION OF THE PADDLER TOM FIRED BULLET AFTER BULLET FROM HIS WONDERFUL RIFLE INTO THE SPOT BUT THOUGH HE KILLED SOME OF THE ALLIGATORS THIS DID NOT SAVE THE MAN'S LIFE HIS BODY WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN
PROFESSOR BUMPER ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD SEE TO IT THAT THE MAN'S FAMILY DID NOT WANT AND THIS SEEMED TO GIVE GENERAL SATISFACTION ESPECIALLY TO A BROTHER WHO WAS WITH THE PARTY ASIDE FROM BEING CAUGHT IN A DRENCHING STORM AND ONE OR TWO MINOR ACCIDENTS
AND FELT THEIR MINDS ATTUNED MOST SOLEMNLY A LONG TIME PASSED AND PEOPLE SAID TO EACH OTHER I WONDER IF THERE IS A CHURCH OUT IN THE WOOD THE BELL HAS A TONE THAT IS WONDROUS SWEET LET US STROLL THITHER AND EXAMINE THE MATTER NEARER
THEIR CLOTHES WOULD GET SO TORN LARGE BLOCKS OF STONE LAY THERE OVERGROWN WITH MOSS OF EVERY COLOR THE FRESH SPRING BUBBLED FORTH AND MADE A STRANGE GURGLING SOUND THAT SURELY CANNOT BE THE BELL SAID ONE OF THE CHILDREN LYING DOWN AND LISTENING
I RATHER THINK THEY'VE GONE BACK WAS THE PROFESSOR'S DRY COMMENT GONE BACK YES THE INDIANS SEEM TO HAVE DESERTED US AT THE ENDING OF THIS STAGE OF OUR JOURNEY BLESS MY TIME TABLE CRIED MISTER DAMON YOU DON'T SAY SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN
HIS BREAST WAS FILLED MORE AND MORE WITH THE FOREST SOLITUDE BUT HE STILL HEARD THE LITTLE BELL WITH WHICH THE OTHERS WERE SO SATISFIED AND NOW AND THEN WHEN THE WIND BLEW HE COULD ALSO HEAR THE PEOPLE SINGING WHO WERE SITTING AT TEA WHERE THE CONFECTIONER HAD HIS TENT
PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THE ACCOUNT HE GAVE OF THE CAUSE OF HIS BEING IN A FRAY I COULDN'T LET THEM BEHAVE SO TO A POOR GIRL COULD I FATHER HE SAID CERTAINLY NOT DIAMOND SAID HIS FATHER QUITE PLEASED FOR DIAMOND'S FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN
AND IN THE GLEAM OF IT HE AND NED SAW FLUTTERING ABOUT THE TENT SOME DARK SHADOW LIKE FORM AT THE SIGHT OF WHICH TOM'S CHUM CRIED
ONE OF THEM LIFTED HIM DOWN AND FROM THAT TIME HE WAS A GREATER FAVOURITE THAN BEFORE AND IF EVER THERE WAS A BOY WHO HAD A CHANCE OF BEING A PRODIGY AT CAB DRIVING DIAMOND WAS THAT BOY FOR THE STRIFE CAME TO BE WHO SHOULD HAVE HIM OUT WITH HIM ON THE BOX
MOST OF WHICH LIVED ON FRUIT OR ON INSECTS THEY CAUGHT THE BLOOD SUCKING BATS WERE COMPARATIVELY FEW AND THE MIGRATORY SORT FEWER STILL WELL WE'RE ON OUR WAY ONCE MORE REMARKED TOM AS AGAIN THEY WERE IN THE CANOES BEING PADDLED UP THE RIVER
THE BELL PEOPLE SAID THE EVENING BELL IS SOUNDING THE SUN IS SETTING FOR A STRANGE WONDROUS TONE WAS HEARD IN THE NARROW STREETS OF A LARGE TOWN IT WAS LIKE THE SOUND OF A CHURCH BELL BUT IT WAS ONLY HEARD FOR A MOMENT
HIS MOTHER HOWEVER WAS A LITTLE SHY OF THE COMPANY FOR HIM AND BESIDES SHE COULD NOT ALWAYS SPARE HIM ALSO HIS FATHER LIKED TO HAVE HIM HIMSELF WHEN HE COULD SO THAT HE WAS MORE DESIRED THAN ENJOYED AMONG THE CABMEN
BLESS THE CHILD HE FORGETS NOTHING SAID HIS MOTHER REALLY DIAMOND A BODY WOULD NEED TO MIND WHAT THEY SAY TO YOU WHY SAID DIAMOND I ONLY THINK ABOUT IT
DIAMOND'S FATHER TURNED INSTANTLY FOR HE WAS THE FOREMOST IN THE RANK AND FOLLOWED THE GIRL ONE OR TWO OTHER PASSING CABS HEARD THE CRY AND MADE FOR THE PLACE BUT THE GIRL HAD TAKEN CARE NOT TO CALL TILL SHE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO GIVE HER FRIENDS THE FIRST CHANCE
HE CURRIED AND HE BRUSHED FIRST AT ONE SIDE OF HIS NECK AND THEN AT THE OTHER WHEN THAT WAS DONE HE ASKED FOR A DRESSING COMB AND COMBED HIS MANE THOROUGHLY THEN HE PUSHED HIMSELF ON TO HIS BACK
IN WHICH WHITE SWANS WERE SWIMMING AND BEAT THE AIR WITH THEIR WINGS THE KING'S SON OFTEN STOOD STILL AND LISTENED HE THOUGHT THE BELL SOUNDED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THESE STILL LAKES BUT THEN HE REMARKED AGAIN THAT THE TONE PROCEEDED NOT FROM THERE
AFTER THAT WELL WE SHALL TRUST TO LUCK FOR WHAT WE SHALL FIND THERE ARE SAID TO BE MANY CURIOUS THINGS WENT ON JACINTO SPEAKING AS THOUGH HE HAD NO INTEREST
AND WOOD AND SEA
SUNG HIS EVENING HYMN AND SAID I CANNOT FIND WHAT I SEEK THE SUN IS GOING DOWN AND NIGHT IS COMING THE DARK DARK NIGHT YET PERHAPS I MAY BE ABLE ONCE MORE TO SEE THE ROUND RED SUN BEFORE HE ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS
WHY IS THAT WHY PERSISTED DIAMOND
SAID HIS MOTHER SHE HAD RINGS ON HER FINGERS ANYHOW RETURNED DIAMOND OF COURSE SHE HAD AS ANY LADY WOULD WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT WHEN WE WERE DOWN AT SANDWICH SAID DIAMOND YOU SAID YOU WOULD HAVE TO PART WITH YOUR MOTHER'S RING NOW WE WERE POOR
THEN HE SAT ON HIS CROUP AND DID HIS BACK AND SIDES
BUT THE POOR CHILD THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WAS QUITE ASHAMED HE LOOKED AT HIS WOODEN SHOES PULLED AT THE SHORT SLEEVES OF HIS JACKET AND SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID HE COULD NOT WALK SO FAST BESIDES HE THOUGHT THAT THE BELL MUST BE LOOKED FOR TO THE RIGHT
SKYBLUE TULIPS WHICH SHONE AS THEY WAVED IN THE WINDS AND APPLE TREES THE APPLES OF WHICH LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE LARGE SOAPBUBBLES SO ONLY THINK HOW THE TREES MUST HAVE SPARKLED IN THE SUNSHINE AROUND THE NICEST GREEN MEADS
BUT WHETHER THE SOUND CAME FROM HIS HEAD OR FROM THE HOLLOW TREE THAT NO ONE COULD SAY WITH CERTAINTY SO NOW HE GOT THE PLACE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER AND WROTE YEARLY A SHORT TREATISE ON THE OWL
THEY WERE EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE SOME ALMOST AS BIG AS HAWKS AND WERE OF THE SUB FAMILY DESMODIDAE THE SCIENTIST SAID THIS IS A TRUE BLOOD SUCKING BAT WENT ON THE PROFESSOR THIS AND HE POINTED TO THE NOSE LEAVES IS THE SUCKING APPARATUS
WE MUST HAVE OVERSLEPT NED WE WERE TO START BEFORE OLD SOL GOT IN HIS HEAVY WORK BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST YET I DIDN'T HEAR ANY ONE CALL US REMARKED NED NOR I WONDER IF WE'RE THE ONLY LAZY BIRDS
BUT MAYHAP THEY MAY GET MORE LAW THAN THEY LIKE SOME DAY THEMSELVES
THEY DREW UP IN THE ROW UPON THE STAND BETWEEN COCKSPUR STREET AND PALL MALL THEY WAITED A LONG TIME BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO WANT TO BE CARRIED ANYWHERE BY AND BY LADIES WOULD BE GOING HOME FROM THE ACADEMY EXHIBITION AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A CHANCE OF A JOB
FOR A TIME IT SEEMED AS IF THE BATS WOULD FAIRLY OVERWHELM THE CAMP SO MANY OF THEM WERE THERE BUT THE INCREASING LIGHTS AND THE ATTACKS MADE BY THE INDIANS AND THE WHITE TRAVELERS TURNED THE TIDE OF BATTLE AND WITH SILENT FLAPPINGS OF THEIR SOFT VELVETY WINGS
WHERE THE HOUSES WERE FARTHER APART WITH GARDENS OR LITTLE FIELDS BETWEEN THEM COULD SEE THE EVENING SKY STILL BETTER AND HEARD THE SOUND OF THE BELL MUCH MORE DISTINCTLY IT WAS AS IF THE TONES CAME FROM A CHURCH IN THE STILL FOREST PEOPLE LOOKED THITHERWARD
AND THEN MISSUS COLEMAN TOOK OUT HER PURSE SAYING AND WHAT'S YOUR FARE JOSEPH NO THANK YOU MA'AM SAID JOSEPH IT WAS YOUR OWN OLD HORSE AS TOOK YOU AND ME YOU PAID LONG AGO HE JUMPED ON HIS BOX BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD
AND ONCE HE SENT THE COMB FLYING OUT OF THE STABLE DOOR TO THE GREAT AMUSEMENT OF THE MEN BUT JACK FETCHED IT AGAIN AND DIAMOND BEGAN ONCE MORE AND DID NOT LEAVE OFF UNTIL HE HAD DONE THE WHOLE BUSINESS FAIRLY WELL IF NOT IN A FIRST RATE EXPERIENCED FASHION
WE SHALL MARCH THERE IN THE MORNING NO USE TO GO THERE AT NIGHT WHEN ALL IS DARK I SUPPOSE THAT IS SO THE INDIANS MADE CAMP AS USUAL THE GOODS BEING BROUGHT FROM THE CANOES AND PILED UP NEAR THE TENTS THEN NIGHT SETTLED DOWN
HE CAUGHT UP HIS CAMERA TRIPOD WHICH WAS NEAR HIS COT AND MADE A SWING WITH IT AT THE CREATURE THAT HAD FLOWN INTO THE TENT THROUGH AN OPENING IT HAD MADE FOR ITSELF LOOK OUT YELLED NED IF IT'S A VAMPIRE IT'LL IT WON'T DO ANYTHING TO ME SHOUTED TOM AS HE STRUCK THE CREATURE
I'M AFRAID HE WAS RATHER A FALSE FRIEND WAS THE PROFESSOR'S ANSWER
BUT PRESENTLY HIS FATHER CAME BACK AND MISSING DIAMOND LOOKED ABOUT
AND THE RICH PEOPLE DROVE OUT AND THE POOR WALKED BUT THE WAY SEEMED STRANGELY LONG TO THEM AND WHEN THEY CAME TO A CLUMP OF WILLOWS WHICH GREW ON THE SKIRTS OF THE FOREST THEY SAT DOWN
I CERTAINLY AM IF THERE'S A FIGHT
THIS MUST BE LOOKED TO SO HE REMAINED AND LET THE OTHERS GO ON WITHOUT HIM THEY AFTERWARDS CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE MADE OF BRANCHES AND THE BARK OF TREES A LARGE WILD APPLE TREE BENT OVER IT
WHEN THEY FOUND THE WAY BLOCKED UP AND UPON INQUIRY WERE INFORMED THAT A STACK OF CHIMNEYS HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN IN THE NIGHT
KNOCKING IT INTO THE CORNER OF THE TENT WITH A THUD THAT TOLD IT MUST BE COMPLETELY STUNNED IF NOT KILLED
FOR HE WAS AN EXCELLENT AND RESOLUTE YOUTH
FOR OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE COME THE OTHER WAS A POOR BOY WHO HAD BORROWED HIS COAT AND BOOTS TO BE CONFIRMED IN FROM THE INNKEEPER'S SON
WE SHALL HAVE TO LIGHT FIRES TO KEEP THEM AWAY IF WE CAN SUCCEED EVERY ONE GRAB UP A CLUB AND STRIKE HARD COME ON CRIED TOM GETTING ON SOME CLOTHES BY THE LIGHT OF HIS GLEAMING ELECTRIC LIGHT WHICH HE HAD SET ON HIS COT YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE ARE YOU ASKED NED
AND THEN HE CALLED TO THE PADDLERS TO INCREASE THEIR STROKES THE JOURNEY UP THE RIVER WAS NOT VERY EVENTFUL MANY ALLIGATORS WERE SEEN AND TOM AND NED SHOT SEVERAL WITH THE ELECTRIC RIFLE TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE THIRD DAY'S TRAVEL THERE WAS A CRY FROM ONE OF THE REAR BOATS
THERE WERE THREE PERSONS WHO ASSERTED THEY HAD PENETRATED TO THE END OF THE FOREST
ONE DAY WHICH WAS NEITHER WASHING DAY NOR CLEANING DAY NOR MARKETING DAY NOR SATURDAY NOR MONDAY UPON WHICH CONSEQUENTLY DIAMOND COULD BE SPARED FROM THE BABY HIS FATHER TOOK HIM ON HIS OWN CAB
SO HE WAS QUITE PLEASED AND PROUD AND PERHAPS SAID TO HIMSELF SOMETHING LIKE THIS I'M A STUPID OLD HORSE WHO CAN'T BRUSH HIS OWN COAT BUT THERE'S MY YOUNG GODSON ON MY BACK CLEANING ME LIKE AN ANGEL I WON'T VOUCH FOR WHAT THE OLD HORSE WAS THINKING
FOR THAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE ALL SORTS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS WERE TO BE FOUND BUT THERE WE SHALL NOT MEET SAID THE KING'S SON NODDING AT THE SAME TIME TO THE POOR BOY WHO WENT INTO THE DARKEST THICKEST PART OF THE WOOD WHERE THORNS TORE HIS HUMBLE DRESS
THE BAT MAKES AN OPENING IN THE SKIN WITH ITS SHARP TEETH AND PROCEEDS TO EXTRACT THE BLOOD I CAN WELL BELIEVE TWO OR THREE OF THEM ATTACKING A STEER OR MULE AT ONCE COULD SOON WEAKEN IT SO THE ANIMAL WOULD DIE AND A MAN TOO ASKED NED
HE DID NOT LEAVE THE STILE AND I HARDLY LIKED TO ASK TO GO BY I INQUIRED SOON IF HE HAD NOT BEEN TO LONDON
AND THOUGHTS BUSILY BENT ON DISCOVERING A MEANS OF EXTRICATION BUT HE HIMSELF LOOKED SO COMPOSED AND SO GRAVE ALSO I BECAME ASHAMED OF FEELING ANY CONFUSION
MISSUS FAIRFAX SURMISED
WHEN I DID SPEAK IT WAS ONLY TO EXPRESS AN IMPETUOUS WISH THAT I HAD NEVER BEEN BORN OR NEVER COME TO THORNFIELD BECAUSE YOU ARE SORRY TO LEAVE IT
AS HE HAD TALKED OF PURCHASING A NEW CARRIAGE SHE SAID THE IDEA OF HIS MARRYING MISS INGRAM STILL SEEMED STRANGE TO HER BUT FROM WHAT EVERYBODY SAID
FOR I DID NOT WISH EITHER CAR OR CARRIAGE TO MEET ME AT MILLCOTE I PROPOSED TO WALK THE DISTANCE QUIETLY BY MYSELF AND VERY QUIETLY AFTER LEAVING MY BOX IN THE OSTLER'S CARE
YOU'RE NOT TURNING YOUR HEAD TO LOOK AFTER MORE MOTHS ARE YOU THAT WAS ONLY A LADY CLOCK CHILD FLYING AWAY HOME
WITH REGARD TO YOU ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE NEAR ME AS NOW IT IS AS IF I HAD A STRING SOMEWHERE UNDER MY LEFT RIBS TIGHTLY AND INEXTRICABLY KNOTTED
THE SWEETEST HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR DAY ITS FERVID FIRES HAD WASTED AND DEW FELL COOL ON PANTING PLAIN AND SCORCHED SUMMIT
AND IN SPITE OF ME THANK YOU MISTER ROCHESTER FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS I AM STRANGELY GLAD TO GET BACK AGAIN TO YOU AND WHEREVER YOU ARE IS MY HOME
AND IF THAT BOISTEROUS CHANNEL AND TWO HUNDRED MILES OR SO OF LAND COME BROAD BETWEEN US I AM AFRAID THAT CORD OF COMMUNION WILL BE SNAPT AND THEN
PERHAPS IF I WALK SOFTLY I CAN SLIP AWAY UNNOTICED I TRODE ON AN EDGING OF TURF THAT THE CRACKLE OF THE PEBBLY GRAVEL MIGHT NOT BETRAY ME
IT WOULD BE PAST THE POWER OF MAGIC SIR AND IN THOUGHT I ADDED A LOVING EYE IS ALL THE CHARM NEEDED TO SUCH YOU ARE HANDSOME ENOUGH
DO YOU THINK BECAUSE I AM POOR OBSCURE PLAIN AND LITTLE I AM SOULLESS AND HEARTLESS YOU THINK WRONG I HAVE AS MUCH SOUL AS YOU
WHICH I FEEL REBEL INSOLENTLY AGAINST MY WILL AND STRUGGLE TO EXPRESS WHAT I HAD RESOLVED TO CONCEAL BUT I HAVE A VEIL IT IS DOWN
IT IS TO BE SURE AND WHEN YOU GET TO BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN JANE
HOW FULL THE HEDGES ARE OF ROSES BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO GATHER ANY I WANT TO BE AT THE HOUSE I PASSED A TALL BRIAR SHOOTING LEAFY AND FLOWERY BRANCHES ACROSS THE PATH
IN SHORT SHE'S AN EXTENSIVE ARMFUL BUT THAT'S NOT TO THE POINT
ITS SOLE SEPARATION FROM LONELY FIELDS A WINDING WALK BORDERED WITH LAURELS AND TERMINATING IN A GIANT HORSE CHESTNUT CIRCLED AT THE BASE BY A SEAT LED DOWN TO THE FENCE HERE ONE COULD WANDER UNSEEN
GEORGIANA SAID SHE DREADED BEING LEFT ALONE WITH ELIZA FROM HER SHE GOT NEITHER SYMPATHY IN HER DEJECTION SUPPORT IN HER FEARS NOR AID IN HER PREPARATIONS
SHE WISHED ME TO LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE TO SEE CALLERS AND ANSWER NOTES OF CONDOLENCE
WARBLING IN A WOOD HALF A MILE OFF NO MOVING FORM IS VISIBLE NO COMING STEP
HOW PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY ARE RETURNING HOME FROM AN ABSENCE LONG OR SHORT I DID NOT KNOW I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE SENSATION
DID I SLIP AWAY FROM THE GEORGE INN ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK OF A JUNE EVENING AND TAKE THE OLD ROAD TO THORNFIELD A ROAD WHICH LAY CHIEFLY THROUGH FIELDS AND WAS NOW LITTLE FREQUENTED
NOR ATTEMPTED TO DISSUADE HER FROM IT THE VOCATION WILL FIT YOU TO A HAIR I THOUGHT MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO YOU WHEN WE PARTED SHE SAID GOOD BYE COUSIN JANE EYRE I WISH YOU WELL
THE GAPING VAULT THE SILENT CHURCH THE SOLEMN SERVICE
IT IS TRUE THAT WHILE I WORKED SHE WOULD IDLE AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF YOU AND I WERE DESTINED
DURING THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS I THOUGHT OF MISSUS REED IN HER LAST MOMENTS I SAW HER DISFIGURED AND DISCOLOURED FACE AND HEARD HER
I AVOIDED SOBBING THE THOUGHT OF MISSUS O'GALL AND BITTERNUTT LODGE STRUCK
ONCE SHE SAID SHE HAD ACTUALLY PUT THE QUESTION TO MISTER ROCHESTER AS TO WHEN HE WAS GOING TO BRING HIS BRIDE HOME BUT HE HAD ANSWERED HER
A DEPENDENT DOES HER DUTY AS WELL AS YOU HAVE DONE YOURS
AGAINST THE VOICE THAT KEPT WARNING ME OF NEAR SEPARATION AND COMING GRIEF
CUSTOM INTERVENED BETWEEN ME AND WHAT I NATURALLY AND INEVITABLY LOVED IT IS A LONG WAY I AGAIN SAID
AND HIMSELF IT IS A LONG WAY TO IRELAND JANET AND I AM SORRY TO SEND MY LITTLE FRIEND ON SUCH WEARY TRAVELS BUT IF I CAN'T DO BETTER
HE WAS STANDING AMONG THE BEDS AT A YARD OR TWO DISTANT FROM WHERE I HAD TO PASS THE MOTH APPARENTLY ENGAGED HIM I SHALL GET BY VERY WELL I MEDITATED
WHILE SUCH HONEY DEW FELL SUCH SILENCE REIGNED SUCH GLOAMING GATHERED I FELT AS IF I COULD HAUNT SUCH SHADE FOR EVER
ALL I HAD NOW TO DO WAS TO OBEY HIM IN SILENCE NO NEED FOR ME TO COLLOQUISE FURTHER I GOT OVER THE STILE WITHOUT A WORD
HOW IS IT TO BE HELPED ARE YOU ANYTHING AKIN TO ME DO YOU THINK JANE I COULD RISK NO SORT OF ANSWER BY THIS TIME MY HEART WAS STILL BECAUSE HE SAID
I BELIEVE YOU MUST JANE I AM SORRY JANET BUT I BELIEVE INDEED YOU MUST THIS WAS A BLOW BUT I DID NOT LET IT PROSTRATE ME
WELL SIR I SHALL BE READY WHEN THE ORDER TO MARCH COMES IT IS COME NOW I MUST GIVE IT TO NIGHT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED SIR
I SHOULD ASSIGN YOU YOUR SHARE OF LABOUR AND COMPEL YOU TO ACCOMPLISH IT OR ELSE IT SHOULD BE LEFT UNDONE
HERE IS THE BENCH AT ITS OLD ROOTS COME WE WILL SIT THERE IN PEACE TO NIGHT THOUGH WE SHOULD NEVER MORE BE DESTINED TO SIT THERE TOGETHER HE SEATED ME
AND MISTER ROCHESTER LOOKED ON WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED SMILING SARDONICALLY AS IT SEEMED AT BOTH HER AND ME I HAD NOT NOTIFIED TO MISSUS FAIRFAX THE EXACT
HE IS FLOWN THE MOTH ROAMED AWAY I WAS SHEEPISHLY RETREATING ALSO BUT MISTER ROCHESTER FOLLOWED ME AND WHEN WE REACHED THE WICKET HE SAID TURN BACK
JANET SAID HE MAKING ROOM FOR ME TO CROSS THE STILE GO UP HOME AND STAY YOUR WEARY LITTLE WANDERING FEET AT A FRIEND'S THRESHOLD
TO SO PRACTISED AND INDEFATIGABLE A HORSEMAN AS MISTER ROCHESTER IT WOULD BE BUT A MORNING'S RIDE I BEGAN TO CHERISH HOPES I HAD NO RIGHT TO CONCEIVE
I NEED NOT MAKE AN ABSOLUTE FOOL OF MYSELF I KNOW ANOTHER WAY TO THE HOUSE IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY IF I KNEW TWENTY WAYS FOR HE HAS SEEN ME
NOT TO SEND FOR A CARRIAGE AND COME CLATTERING OVER STREET AND ROAD LIKE A COMMON MORTAL BUT TO STEAL INTO THE VICINAGE OF YOUR HOME ALONG WITH TWILIGHT
WEARY WITH GATHERING WILD STRAWBERRIES IN HAY LANE HALF THE DAY HAD GONE TO BED WITH THE SUN I WATCHED HER DROP ASLEEP AND WHEN I LEFT HER I SOUGHT THE GARDEN IT WAS NOW
SHE STAYED IN HER OWN ROOM HER DOOR BOLTED WITHIN FILLING TRUNKS EMPTYING DRAWERS BURNING PAPERS AND HOLDING NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANY ONE
DEAD AND TELLS ME SO WHEN SHE MEETS ME ALONE HERE IN THE GLOAMING IF I DARED I'D TOUCH YOU TO SEE IF YOU ARE SUBSTANCE OR SHADOW YOU ELF
I DID NOT LIKE TO WALK AT THIS HOUR ALONE WITH MISTER ROCHESTER IN THE SHADOWY ORCHARD BUT I COULD NOT FIND A REASON TO ALLEGE FOR LEAVING HIM I FOLLOWED WITH LAGGING STEP
MISSUS FAIRFAX TOLD ME IN A LETTER AND DID SHE INFORM YOU WHAT I WENT TO
BUT I'D AS SOON OFFER TO TAKE HOLD OF A BLUE IGNIS FATUUS LIGHT IN A MARSH TRUANT TRUANT HE ADDED WHEN HE HAD PAUSED AN INSTANT
SEEMED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF A GROUP SO AMICABLE WHEN HE SAID HE SUPPOSED THE OLD LADY WAS ALL RIGHT NOW THAT SHE HAD GOT HER ADOPTED DAUGHTER BACK AGAIN
AS I SHALL NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFER EITHER TO HER OR HER SISTER AGAIN I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE THAT GEORGIANA MADE AN ADVANTAGEOUS MATCH WITH A WEALTHY WORN OUT MAN OF FASHION
NOW LIFTING THE GOOSEBERRY TREE BRANCHES TO LOOK AT THE FRUIT LARGE AS PLUMS WITH WHICH THEY ARE LADEN NOW TAKING A RIPE CHERRY FROM THE WALL
BUT THAT PERFUME INCREASES I MUST FLEE I MAKE FOR THE WICKET LEADING TO THE SHRUBBERY AND I SEE MISTER ROCHESTER ENTERING
NO VISITS TO INGRAM PARK TO BE SURE IT WAS TWENTY MILES OFF ON THE BORDERS OF ANOTHER COUNTY BUT WHAT WAS THAT DISTANCE TO AN ARDENT LOVER
NOW AT THE HOUR I ARRIVE I HAVE BUT A FIELD OR TWO TO TRAVERSE AND THEN I SHALL CROSS THE ROAD AND REACH THE GATES
IT ALIGHTS ON A PLANT AT MISTER ROCHESTER'S FOOT HE SEES IT AND BENDS TO EXAMINE IT NOW HE HAS HIS BACK TOWARDS ME THOUGHT I AND HE IS OCCUPIED TOO
YOUR STERNNESS HAS A POWER BEYOND BEAUTY MISTER ROCHESTER HAD SOMETIMES READ MY UNSPOKEN THOUGHTS WITH AN ACUMEN TO ME INCOMPREHENSIBLE
YES SIR IN DIFFERENT WAYS I HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR BOTH
AND MEANT TO LEAVE HIM CALMLY AN IMPULSE HELD ME FAST A FORCE TURNED ME ROUND I SAID OR SOMETHING IN ME SAID FOR ME
BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND YOU'LL LIKE IRELAND I THINK THEY'RE SUCH WARM HEARTED PEOPLE THERE THEY SAY IT IS A LONG WAY OFF SIR
THEN I MUST GO YOU HAVE SAID IT YOURSELF NO YOU MUST STAY I SWEAR IT AND THE OATH SHALL BE KEPT
ONE CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF SUCH A VERY EXCELLENT THING AS MY BEAUTIFUL BLANCHE WELL AS I WAS SAYING LISTEN TO ME JANE
ABSENT FROM ME A WHOLE MONTH AND FORGETTING ME QUITE I'LL BE SWORN I KNEW THERE WOULD BE PLEASURE IN MEETING MY MASTER AGAIN
I'VE A NERVOUS NOTION I SHOULD TAKE TO BLEEDING INWARDLY AS FOR YOU YOU'D FORGET ME THAT I NEVER SHOULD SIR YOU KNOW IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED JANE
JUST AS IF BOTH HAD PASSED THROUGH THE GRAVE AND WE STOOD AT GOD'S FEET EQUAL AS WE ARE AS WE ARE
MY JOURNEY SEEMED TEDIOUS VERY TEDIOUS FIFTY MILES ONE DAY A NIGHT SPENT AT AN INN FIFTY MILES THE NEXT DAY
AND ADDED THAT HE SAW ADELE WAS PRETE A
TO ONE WITH WHOM YOU HAVE NO SYMPATHY WHOM I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU TRULY LOVE FOR I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD YOU SNEER AT HER I WOULD SCORN SUCH A UNION THEREFORE I AM BETTER THAN YOU LET ME GO
WHICH IS SUCH THAT I HAVE MADE IT MY LAW OF ACTION ADELE MUST GO TO SCHOOL AND YOU MISS EYRE MUST GET A NEW SITUATION YES SIR
THAT THE MATCH WAS BROKEN OFF THAT RUMOUR HAD BEEN MISTAKEN THAT ONE OR BOTH PARTIES HAD CHANGED THEIR MINDS I USED TO LOOK AT MY MASTER'S FACE TO SEE IF IT WERE SAD OR FIERCE
KNEELING ON THE CARPET HAD NESTLED CLOSE UP TO ME AND A SENSE OF MUTUAL AFFECTION SEEMED TO SURROUND US WITH A RING OF GOLDEN PEACE I UTTERED A SILENT PRAYER
DECENTLY AND IN ORDER I SHALL EMBRACE THE TENETS OF ROME AND PROBABLY TAKE THE VEIL I NEITHER EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT THIS RESOLUTION
THE EVENING ARRIVAL AT THE GREAT TOWN OF SCATTERED THESE THOUGHTS NIGHT GAVE THEM QUITE ANOTHER TURN
IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF MY ABRUPT VOCAL RESPONSE BUT HE SMILED AT ME WITH A CERTAIN SMILE HE HAD OF HIS OWN
WHAT BRIDE I HAVE NO BRIDE BUT YOU WILL HAVE YES I WILL I WILL HE SET HIS TEETH
NOW STOOPING TOWARDS A KNOT OF FLOWERS EITHER TO INHALE THEIR FRAGRANCE OR TO ADMIRE THE DEW BEADS ON THEIR PETALS A GREAT MOTH GOES HUMMING BY ME
MISSUS FAIRFAX WILL SMILE YOU A CALM WELCOME TO BE SURE SAID I AND LITTLE ADELE WILL CLAP HER HANDS AND JUMP TO SEE YOU
A NUNNERY YOU WOULD CALL IT THERE I SHALL BE QUIET AND UNMOLESTED
BUT OF THE CRUMBS HE SCATTERED TO STRAY AND STRANGER BIRDS LIKE ME WAS TO FEAST GENIALLY HIS LAST WORDS WERE BALM THEY SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT IT IMPORTED SOMETHING TO HIM
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT SADLY FAILS ME IN FRAMING AN EXCUSE AND ALWAYS THE LAPSE OCCURS AT SOME CRISIS
I SEE THE NARROW STILE WITH STONE STEPS AND I SEE MISTER ROCHESTER SITTING THERE A BOOK AND A PENCIL IN HIS HAND HE IS WRITING
TO A SIMILAR STRING SITUATED IN THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF YOUR LITTLE FRAME
HILLO HE CRIES AND HE PUTS UP HIS BOOK AND HIS PENCIL THERE YOU ARE COME ON IF YOU PLEASE I SUPPOSE I DO COME ON
I HAD HEARD FROM MISSUS FAIRFAX IN THE INTERIM OF MY ABSENCE THE PARTY AT THE HALL WAS DISPERSED MISTER ROCHESTER HAD LEFT FOR LONDON THREE WEEKS AGO
THE WEST TOO WAS WARM NO WATERY GLEAM CHILLED IT IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WAS A FIRE LIT AN ALTAR BURNING BEHIND ITS SCREEN OF MARBLED VAPOUR
SHE WAS NOW AT LAST INVITED BY HER UNCLE MISTER GIBSON
MYSELF LOOK OUT FOR EMPLOYMENT AND AN ASYLUM FOR YOU THANK YOU SIR I AM SORRY TO GIVE OH
WITH WHAT I REVERENCE WITH WHAT I DELIGHT IN WITH AN ORIGINAL A VIGOROUS AN EXPANDED MIND I HAVE KNOWN YOU MISTER ROCHESTER AND IT STRIKES ME WITH TERROR
AND WHICH HE USED BUT ON RARE OCCASIONS HE SEEMED TO THINK IT TOO GOOD FOR COMMON PURPOSES IT WAS THE REAL SUNSHINE OF FEELING HE SHED IT OVER ME NOW PASS
EVEN SINGLY OUR WAVE GIRT LAND
I HAD MADE NO NOISE HE HAD NOT EYES BEHIND COULD HIS SHADOW FEEL I STARTED AT FIRST AND THEN I APPROACHED HIM
AND FULL AS MUCH HEART AND IF GOD HAD GIFTED ME WITH SOME BEAUTY AND MUCH WEALTH I SHOULD HAVE MADE IT AS HARD FOR YOU TO LEAVE ME AS IT IS NOW FOR ME TO LEAVE YOU
STRANGELY ALTERED VOICE I MUSED ON THE FUNERAL DAY THE COFFIN THE HEARSE THE BLACK TRAIN OF TENANTS AND SERVANTS FEW WAS THE NUMBER OF RELATIVES
THAT I CONSENT THUS TO RENDER IT SO PATIENT AND COMPLIANT ON MY PART AT LAST I SAW GEORGIANA OFF
WE'LL TALK OVER THE VOYAGE AND THE PARTING QUIETLY HALF AN HOUR OR SO WHILE THE STARS ENTER INTO THEIR SHINING LIFE UP IN HEAVEN YONDER HERE IS THE CHESTNUT TREE
THE VEHEMENCE OF EMOTION STIRRED BY GRIEF AND LOVE WITHIN ME WAS CLAIMING MASTERY AND STRUGGLING FOR FULL SWAY AND ASSERTING A RIGHT TO PREDOMINATE TO OVERCOME
LOOK AT HIS WINGS SAID HE HE REMINDS ME RATHER OF A WEST INDIAN INSECT ONE DOES NOT OFTEN SEE SO LARGE AND GAY A NIGHT ROVER IN ENGLAND THERE
OF A BALL ROOM THE OTHER THE INMATE OF A CONVENT CELL AND I DWELT ON AND ANALYSED THEIR SEPARATE PECULIARITIES OF PERSON AND CHARACTER
NOTHING TO YOU DO YOU THINK I AM AN AUTOMATON
IT IS MISTER ROCHESTER'S CIGAR I LOOK ROUND AND I LISTEN I SEE TREES LADEN WITH RIPENING FRUIT I HEAR A NIGHTINGALE
FULL LEAVED AND DEEPLY TINTED CONTRASTED WELL WITH THE SUNNY HUE OF THE CLEARED MEADOWS BETWEEN ON MIDSUMMER EVE ADELE
BECAUSE I HAVE LIVED IN IT A FULL AND DELIGHTFUL LIFE MOMENTARILY AT LEAST I HAVE NOT BEEN TRAMPLED ON I HAVE NOT BEEN PETRIFIED
MISSUS FAIRFAX RECEIVED ME WITH HER USUAL PLAIN FRIENDLINESS LEAH SMILED AND EVEN SOPHIE BID ME BON SOIR WITH GLEE
THEY ARE MAKING HAY TOO IN THORNFIELD MEADOWS OR RATHER THE LABOURERS ARE JUST QUITTING THEIR WORK AND RETURNING HOME WITH THEIR RAKES ON THEIR SHOULDERS
THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE PARTED FAR OR SOON BUT WHEN AS WE THUS SAT MISTER ROCHESTER ENTERED UNANNOUNCED AND LOOKING AT US
TO LONG FOR A PLENTEOUS MEAL AND A GOOD FIRE AND TO BE UNABLE TO GET EITHER NEITHER OF THESE RETURNINGS WAS VERY PLEASANT OR DESIRABLE
AND YOU ARE PARTED FROM HIM FOR EVER AND THEN I STRANGLED A NEW BORN AGONY A DEFORMED THING WHICH I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO OWN AND REAR AND RAN ON
ANOTHER EFFORT SET ME AT LIBERTY AND I STOOD
FOR THE HOUR OF REPOSE IS EXPIRED MUST I MOVE ON SIR I ASKED MUST I LEAVE THORNFIELD
THAT HE WAS SO SOON TO CEASE TO BE MY MASTER
AT THE BOTTOM WAS A SUNK FENCE
I LEFT REMINISCENCE FOR ANTICIPATION I WAS GOING BACK TO THORNFIELD BUT HOW LONG WAS I TO STAY THERE NOT LONG OF THAT I WAS SURE
EVENTIDE IS AS PLEASANT TO HIM AS TO ME AND THIS ANTIQUE GARDEN AS ATTRACTIVE AND HE STROLLS ON
OH YES SIR EVERYBODY KNEW YOUR ERRAND YOU MUST SEE THE CARRIAGE JANE AND TELL ME IF YOU DON'T THINK IT WILL SUIT MISSUS ROCHESTER EXACTLY
AND WHETHER SHE WON'T LOOK LIKE QUEEN BOADICEA LEANING BACK AGAINST THOSE PURPLE CUSHIONS I WISH JANE I WERE A TRIFLE BETTER ADAPTED TO MATCH WITH HER EXTERNALLY
IN ABOUT A MONTH I HOPE TO BE A BRIDEGROOM CONTINUED MISTER ROCHESTER AND IN THE INTERIM I SHALL
WELL HE IS NOT A GHOST YET EVERY NERVE I HAVE IS UNSTRUNG FOR A MOMENT I AM BEYOND MY OWN MASTERY WHAT DOES IT MEAN
AND SHE ADDED I AM OBLIGED TO YOU FOR YOUR VALUABLE SERVICES AND DISCREET CONDUCT THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIVING WITH SUCH AN ONE AS YOU AND WITH GEORGIANA
I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD TREMBLE IN THIS WAY WHEN I SAW HIM OR LOSE MY VOICE OR THE POWER OF MOTION IN HIS PRESENCE I WILL GO BACK AS SOON AS I CAN STIR
FACING MY UNKNOWN FOE AND THEN THE MOONLIGHT FLOODED THE CAVE
MY ATTENTION WAS QUICKLY RIVETED BY A LARGE RED STAR CLOSE TO THE DISTANT HORIZON AS I GAZED UPON IT I FELT A SPELL OF OVERPOWERING FASCINATION IT WAS MARS THE GOD OF WAR
AND EXHIBIT HER LAST AGONIES AT THE GREAT GAMES BEFORE TAL HAJUS REPLIED SARKOJA WHAT WILL BE THE MANNER OF HER GOING OUT INQUIRED SOLA SHE IS VERY SMALL AND VERY BEAUTIFUL I HAD HOPED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD HER FOR RANSOM
AS I CAME BACK TO MYSELF I GLANCED AT SOLA WHO HAD WITNESSED THIS ENCOUNTER AND I WAS SURPRISED TO NOTE A STRANGE EXPRESSION UPON HER USUALLY EXPRESSIONLESS COUNTENANCE WHAT HER THOUGHTS WERE I DID NOT KNOW FOR AS YET I HAD LEARNED BUT LITTLE OF THE MARTIAN TONGUE
THEY HAVE NO LAWYERS I DID NOT SEE THE PRISONER AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER AND THEN ONLY TO CATCH A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF HER AS SHE WAS BEING CONDUCTED TO THE GREAT AUDIENCE CHAMBER WHERE I HAD HAD MY FIRST MEETING WITH LORQUAS PTOMEL
THE NOISE OF THE APPROACHING HORSES HAD CEASED AND I JUDGED THE INDIANS WERE CREEPING STEALTHILY UPON ME ALONG THE LITTLE LEDGE WHICH LED TO MY LIVING TOMB I REMEMBER THAT I HOPED THEY WOULD MAKE SHORT WORK OF ME
DRIFTING UNGUIDED AND UNMANNED THROUGH THE LONELY WASTES OF THE MARTIAN HEAVENS A DERELICT OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TYPIFYING THE LIFE STORY OF THESE STRANGE AND FEROCIOUS CREATURES INTO WHOSE UNFRIENDLY HANDS FATE HAD CARRIED IT
AFTER THEY HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR THE ADULTS TO CARRY ON A DESULTORY CONVERSATION FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE LAPSING INTO SLEEP AND NOW THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE I WAS ALWAYS A KEEN LISTENER ALTHOUGH I NEVER PROFFERED ANY REMARKS MYSELF
INSTANTLY THE WARRIORS CEASED FIRING
EACH FACE WAS THE PICTURE OF AWE AND FEAR BUT FOR WHAT REASON I DID NOT KNOW NOR DID I LEARN UNTIL TEN YEARS LATER THAT THERE WERE STILL OTHER BRAVES BEHIND THOSE WHO REGARDED ME WAS APPARENT FROM THE FACT THAT THE LEADERS PASSED BACK WHISPERED WORD TO THOSE BEHIND THEM
I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT THERE WERE ANY BETTER CONDITIONS TO ESCAPE TO BUT I WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE MY CHANCES AMONG PEOPLE FASHIONED AFTER MY OWN MOLD RATHER THAN TO REMAIN LONGER AMONG THE HIDEOUS AND BLOODTHIRSTY GREEN MEN OF MARS
OR OF REINFORCEMENTS IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT SHE WOULD STRIKE THE FACE OF THE BUILDINGS ABOUT A MILE SOUTH OF OUR POSITION AND AS I WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF THE CHASE I SAW A NUMBER OF WARRIORS GALLOP AHEAD DISMOUNT AND ENTER THE BUILDING SHE SEEMED DESTINED TO TOUCH
AND HER EYES MET MINE HER FACE WAS OVAL AND BEAUTIFUL IN THE EXTREME HER EVERY FEATURE WAS FINELY CHISELED AND EXQUISITE HER EYES LARGE AND LUSTROUS AND HER HEAD SURMOUNTED BY A MASS OF COAL BLACK WAVING HAIR
MY BREATH WAS COMING IN QUICK SHORT GASPS COLD SWEAT STOOD OUT FROM EVERY PORE OF MY BODY AND THE ANCIENT EXPERIMENT OF PINCHING REVEALED THE FACT THAT I WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A WRAITH
THEY ALL LAPSED INTO SILENCE AND WERE SOON ASLEEP ONE THING THE EPISODE HAD ACCOMPLISHED WAS TO ASSURE ME OF SOLA'S FRIENDLINESS TOWARD THE POOR GIRL AND ALSO TO CONVINCE ME THAT I HAD BEEN EXTREMELY FORTUNATE IN FALLING INTO HER HANDS RATHER THAN THOSE OF SOME OF THE OTHER FEMALES
BUT ARE ALSO THE ARTISANS WHO PRODUCE EVERY MANUFACTURED ARTICLE WROUGHT BY THE GREEN MARTIANS THEY MAKE THE POWDER THE CARTRIDGES THE FIREARMS IN FACT EVERYTHING OF VALUE IS PRODUCED BY THE FEMALES IN TIME OF ACTUAL WARFARE THEY FORM A PART OF THE RESERVES
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE STILL WAS TOO HIGH FOR THEM TO HOPE TO REACH HER DECKS FROM MY VANTAGE POINT IN THE WINDOW I COULD SEE THE BODIES OF HER CREW STREWN ABOUT ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT MANNER OF CREATURES THEY MIGHT BE
I ATTEMPTED TO SPRING TO MY FEET BUT WAS HORRIFIED TO DISCOVER THAT MY MUSCLES REFUSED TO RESPOND TO MY WILL I WAS NOW THOROUGHLY AWAKE BUT AS UNABLE TO MOVE A MUSCLE AS THOUGH TURNED TO STONE IT WAS THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME
HIS EYES BULGING AND HIS JAW DROPPED AND THEN ANOTHER SAVAGE FACE APPEARED AND A THIRD AND FOURTH AND FIFTH CRANING THEIR NECKS OVER THE SHOULDERS OF THEIR FELLOWS WHOM THEY COULD NOT PASS UPON THE NARROW LEDGE
TO THE UNEXPECTED SUDDENNESS OF THE FIRST VOLLEY WHICH CAUGHT THE SHIP'S CREWS ENTIRELY UNPREPARED AND THE SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE GUNS UNPROTECTED FROM THE DEADLY AIM OF OUR WARRIORS
THE ENTIRE CAVALCADE OF CHARIOTS MASTODONS AND MOUNTED WARRIORS WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN SOLA AND I HAD ENTERED A BUILDING UPON THE FRONT OF THE CITY IN FACT THE SAME ONE IN WHICH I HAD HAD MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE APES AND WISHING TO SEE WHAT HAD CAUSED THE SUDDEN RETREAT
THIS HAD RECEIVED THE BRUNT OF OUR FIRE AND SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY UNMANNED AS NOT A MOVING FIGURE WAS VISIBLE UPON HER DECKS SLOWLY SHE SWUNG FROM HER COURSE
AND A BEARING AT ONCE RESPECTFUL AND MENACING LATER SOLA WITH THE AID OF SEVERAL OF THE OTHER WOMEN REMODELED THE TRAPPINGS TO FIT MY LESSER PROPORTIONS AND AFTER THEY COMPLETED THE WORK I WENT ABOUT GARBED IN ALL THE PANOPLY OF WAR
THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS FIRED A TERRIFIC VOLLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS FACING THE LITTLE VALLEY ACROSS WHICH THE GREAT SHIPS WERE SO PEACEFULLY ADVANCING INSTANTLY THE SCENE CHANGED AS BY MAGIC
BUT WHY I SHOULD RETAIN MY MENTAL FACULTIES AND YET BE UNABLE TO MOVE I COULD NOT FATHOM I LAY FACING THE OPENING OF THE CAVE AND WHERE I COULD SEE THE SHORT STRETCH OF TRAIL WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE CAVE AND THE TURN OF THE CLIFF AROUND WHICH THE TRAIL LED
WITH ONE'S BACK TOWARD SOME HORRIBLE AND UNKNOWN DANGER FROM THE VERY SOUND OF WHICH THE FEROCIOUS APACHE WARRIORS TURN IN WILD STAMPEDE AS A FLOCK OF SHEEP WOULD MADLY FLEE FROM A PACK OF WOLVES SEEMS TO ME THE LAST WORD IN FEARSOME PREDICAMENTS
AND THE PEOPLES WERE AS SOFT AS THE STUFF THEY SAILED UPON IN OUR DAY WE HAVE PROGRESSED TO A POINT WHERE SUCH SENTIMENTS MARK WEAKNESS AND ATAVISM IT WILL NOT BE WELL FOR YOU TO PERMIT TARS TARKAS TO LEARN THAT YOU HOLD SUCH DEGENERATE SENTIMENTS
AND A MIGHTY HOPE SURGED THROUGH ME THAT THE FLEET WOULD RETURN AND DEMAND A RECKONING FROM THE GREEN WARRIORS WHO HAD SO RUTHLESSLY AND WANTONLY ATTACKED IT CLOSE AT MY HEEL IN HIS NOW ACCUSTOMED PLACE FOLLOWED WOOLA THE HOUND
AS I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD CARE TO ENTRUST SUCH AS YOU WITH THE GRAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF MATERNITY I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH MY EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN THIS RED WOMAN RETORTED SOLA SHE HAS NEVER HARMED US NOR WOULD SHE SHOULD WE HAVE FALLEN INTO HER HANDS
SUDDENLY A LOW BUT DISTINCT MOANING SOUND ISSUED FROM THE RECESSES OF THE CAVE BEHIND ME AND AS IT REACHED THE EARS OF THE INDIANS THEY TURNED AND FLED IN TERROR PANIC STRICKEN SO FRANTIC WERE THEIR EFFORTS TO ESCAPE FROM THE UNSEEN THING BEHIND ME
I COULD SEE FIGURES CROWDING THE FORWARD DECKS AND UPPER WORKS OF THE AIR CRAFT WHETHER THEY HAD DISCOVERED US OR SIMPLY WERE LOOKING AT THE DESERTED CITY I COULD NOT SAY BUT IN ANY EVENT THEY RECEIVED A RUDE RECEPTION FOR SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING
IT WAS AN EFFORT OF THE MIND OF THE WILL OF THE NERVES NOT MUSCULAR FOR I COULD NOT MOVE EVEN SO MUCH AS MY LITTLE FINGER BUT NONE THE LESS MIGHTY FOR ALL THAT AND THEN SOMETHING GAVE THERE WAS A MOMENTARY FEELING OF NAUSEA
AS I DID NOT PARTICULARLY RELISH THE THOUGHT OF THE INNUMERABLE THINGS THEY MIGHT DO TO ME IF THE SPIRIT PROMPTED THEM I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BEFORE A STEALTHY SOUND APPRISED ME OF THEIR NEARNESS AND THEN A WAR BONNETED PAINT STREAKED FACE WAS THRUST CAUTIOUSLY AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE CLIFF
AND IN A FEW MOMENTS THEY HAD THROWN OUT GRAPPLING HOOKS AND THE BIG BOAT WAS BEING HAULED TO GROUND BY THEIR FELLOWS BELOW AFTER MAKING HER FAST THEY SWARMED THE SIDES AND SEARCHED THE VESSEL FROM STEM TO STERN
I REASONED WITH MYSELF THAT I HAD LAIN HELPLESS FOR MANY HOURS WITHIN THE CAVE
I KNEW THAT SHE WAS FOND OF ME AND NOW THAT I HAD DISCOVERED THAT SHE HATED CRUELTY AND BARBARITY I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I COULD DEPEND UPON HER TO AID ME AND THE GIRL CAPTIVE TO ESCAPE PROVIDED OF COURSE THAT SUCH A THING WAS WITHIN THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES
HE CAN METE OUT NO WORSE FATE TO ME THAN A CONTINUATION OF THE HORRIBLE EXISTENCE WE ARE FORCED TO LEAD IN THIS LIFE THIS WILD OUTBREAK ON THE PART OF SOLA SO GREATLY SURPRISED AND SHOCKED THE OTHER WOMEN THAT AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GENERAL REPRIMAND
FOREVER WARRING AMONG OUR OWN KIND AS WELL AS UPON THE RED MEN AND EVEN IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES THE INDIVIDUALS FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES OH IT IS ONE CONTINUAL AWFUL PERIOD OF BLOODSHED FROM THE TIME WE BREAK THE SHELL UNTIL WE GLADLY EMBRACE THE BOSOM OF THE RIVER OF MYSTERY
AS THE EMPTYING OF THE CONTENTS OF VARIOUS CARBOYS UPON THE DEAD BODIES OF THE SAILORS AND OVER THE DECKS AND WORKS OF THE VESSEL THIS OPERATION CONCLUDED THEY HASTILY CLAMBERED OVER HER SIDES SLIDING DOWN THE GUY ROPES TO THE GROUND
A SENSE OF DELICIOUS DREAMINESS OVERCAME ME MY MUSCLES RELAXED AND I WAS ON THE POINT OF GIVING WAY TO MY DESIRE TO SLEEP WHEN THE SOUND OF APPROACHING HORSES REACHED MY EARS
AND A QUANTITY OF SOLID FOODS AND LIQUIDS INCLUDING MANY CASKS OF WATER THE FIRST I HAD SEEN SINCE MY ADVENT UPON MARS
EACH CARRIED A STRANGE BANNER SWUNG FROM STEM TO STERN ABOVE THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE PROW OF EACH WAS PAINTED SOME ODD DEVICE THAT GLEAMED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND SHOWED PLAINLY EVEN AT THE DISTANCE AT WHICH WE WERE FROM THE VESSELS
AND THE SIGHT WHICH MET MY EYES WAS THAT OF A SLENDER GIRLISH FIGURE SIMILAR IN EVERY DETAIL TO THE EARTHLY WOMEN OF MY PAST LIFE SHE DID NOT SEE ME AT FIRST BUT JUST AS SHE WAS DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE PORTAL OF THE BUILDING WHICH WAS TO BE HER PRISON SHE TURNED
THE LAST WARRIOR TO LEAVE THE DECK TURNED AND THREW SOMETHING BACK UPON THE VESSEL WAITING AN INSTANT TO NOTE THE OUTCOME OF HIS ACT AS A FAINT SPURT OF FLAME ROSE FROM THE POINT WHERE THE MISSILE STRUCK HE SWUNG OVER THE SIDE AND WAS QUICKLY UPON THE GROUND
AND TO FULLY UNDERSTAND PRACTICALLY ALL THAT I HEARD AT THIS TIME OUR SLEEPING QUARTERS WERE OCCUPIED BY THREE OR FOUR FEMALES AND A COUPLE OF THE RECENTLY HATCHED YOUNG BESIDE SOLA AND HER YOUTHFUL WARD MYSELF AND WOOLA THE HOUND
WITH THE EYES STARING TOWARD THE OPEN LEDGE AND THE HANDS RESTING LIMPLY UPON THE GROUND I LOOKED FIRST AT MY LIFELESS CLAY THERE UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CAVE AND THEN DOWN AT MYSELF IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT FOR THERE I LAY CLOTHED
I MOUNTED TO AN UPPER FLOOR AND PEERED FROM THE WINDOW OUT OVER THE VALLEY AND THE HILLS BEYOND AND THERE I SAW THE CAUSE OF THEIR SUDDEN SCURRYING TO COVER A HUGE CRAFT LONG LOW AND GRAY PAINTED SWUNG SLOWLY OVER THE CREST OF THE NEAREST HILL
A SIGN WHICH I DID NOT OF COURSE UNDERSTAND JUST A MOMENT WE GAZED UPON EACH OTHER AND THEN THE LOOK OF HOPE AND RENEWED COURAGE WHICH HAD GLORIFIED HER FACE AS SHE DISCOVERED ME FADED INTO ONE OF UTTER DEJECTION MINGLED WITH LOATHING AND CONTEMPT
AS I GAZED AT IT ON THAT FAR GONE NIGHT IT SEEMED TO CALL ACROSS THE UNTHINKABLE VOID TO LURE ME TO IT TO DRAW ME AS THE LODESTONE ATTRACTS A PARTICLE OF IRON MY LONGING WAS BEYOND THE POWER OF OPPOSITION
AND THERE CAME AGAIN FROM THE BLACK SHADOWS THE SOUND OF A MOVING THING AND A FAINT RUSTLING AS OF DEAD LEAVES THE SHOCK TO MY ALREADY OVERSTRAINED NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE IN THE EXTREME AND WITH A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT I STROVE TO BREAK MY AWFUL BONDS
MUCH DEPRESSED AND TO ME UNACCOUNTABLY SO I SLOWLY DESCENDED TO THE STREET THE SCENE I HAD WITNESSED SEEMED TO MARK THE DEFEAT AND ANNIHILATION OF THE FORCES OF A KINDRED PEOPLE
I WAS NOT YET PROFICIENT WITH ALL THE WEAPONS BUT MY GREAT FAMILIARITY WITH SIMILAR EARTHLY WEAPONS MADE ME AN UNUSUALLY APT PUPIL AND I PROGRESSED IN A VERY SATISFACTORY MANNER THE TRAINING OF MYSELF AND THE YOUNG MARTIANS WAS CONDUCTED SOLELY BY THE WOMEN
THAT I NOTICED A SLIGHT VAPOR FILLING THE CAVE IT WAS EXTREMELY TENUOUS AND ONLY NOTICEABLE AGAINST THE OPENING WHICH LED TO DAYLIGHT THERE ALSO CAME TO MY NOSTRILS A FAINTLY PUNGENT ODOR AND I COULD ONLY ASSUME THAT I HAD BEEN OVERCOME BY SOME POISONOUS GAS
AND WHEN THE NECESSITY ARISES FIGHT WITH EVEN GREATER INTELLIGENCE AND FEROCITY THAN THE MEN THE MEN ARE TRAINED IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF THE ART OF WAR IN STRATEGY AND THE MANEUVERING OF LARGE BODIES OF TROOPS
RATHER THAN THE ROUTING BY OUR GREEN WARRIORS OF A HORDE OF SIMILAR THOUGH UNFRIENDLY CREATURES I COULD NOT FATHOM THE SEEMING HALLUCINATION NOR COULD I FREE MYSELF FROM IT BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF MY SOUL I FELT A STRANGE YEARNING TOWARD THESE UNKNOWN FOEMEN
AND SAVAGE EYES LOOKED INTO MINE THAT HE COULD SEE ME IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE CAVE I WAS SURE FOR THE EARLY MORNING SUN WAS FALLING FULL UPON ME THROUGH THE OPENING THE FELLOW INSTEAD OF APPROACHING MERELY STOOD AND STARED
AND FOLLOWED THE RETREATING ARMADA WITH A CONTINUOUS FUSILLADE OF DEADLY FIRE ONE BY ONE HOWEVER THE SHIPS MANAGED TO DIP BELOW THE CRESTS OF THE OUTLYING HILLS UNTIL ONLY ONE BARELY MOVING CRAFT WAS IN SIGHT
AND THEN COMMENCED A SYSTEMATIC RIFLING OF THE VESSEL THIS OPERATION REQUIRED SEVERAL HOURS DURING WHICH TIME A NUMBER OF THE CHARIOTS WERE REQUISITIONED TO TRANSPORT THE LOOT WHICH CONSISTED IN ARMS AMMUNITION SILKS FURS JEWELS STRANGELY CARVED STONE VESSELS
HER SKIN WAS OF A LIGHT REDDISH COPPER COLOR AGAINST WHICH THE CRIMSON GLOW OF HER CHEEKS AND THE RUBY OF HER BEAUTIFULLY MOLDED LIPS SHONE WITH A STRANGELY ENHANCING EFFECT SHE WAS AS DESTITUTE OF CLOTHES AS THE GREEN MARTIANS WHO ACCOMPANIED HER
AND AS MY HORSE HAD WANDERED OFF I WAS LEFT WITHOUT MEANS OF DEFENSE MY ONLY ALTERNATIVE SEEMED TO LIE IN FLIGHT
AND FROM MY BALCONY I COULD SEE THAT IT WALKED ERECT UPON TWO LEGS AND SURMISED THAT IT WAS SOME NEW AND STRANGE MARTIAN MONSTROSITY WITH WHICH I HAD NOT AS YET BECOME ACQUAINTED THEY REMOVED THEIR PRISONER TO THE GROUND
FROM THEN ON SOLA INSTRUCTED ME IN THE MYSTERIES OF THE VARIOUS WEAPONS AND WITH THE MARTIAN YOUNG I SPENT SEVERAL HOURS EACH DAY PRACTICING UPON THE PLAZA
I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE UNNECESSARY HARSHNESS AND BRUTALITY WITH WHICH HER GUARDS TREATED HER SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ALMOST MATERNAL KINDLINESS WHICH SOLA MANIFESTED TOWARD ME AND THE RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE OF THE FEW GREEN MARTIANS WHO TOOK THE TROUBLE TO NOTICE ME AT ALL
SO DIFFERENT IS IT FROM THE ASPECT OF ANY OTHER SPOT UPON OUR EARTH AS I STOOD THUS MEDITATING I TURNED MY GAZE FROM THE LANDSCAPE TO THE HEAVENS WHERE THE MYRIAD STARS FORMED A GORGEOUS AND FITTING CANOPY FOR THE WONDERS OF THE EARTHLY SCENE
I DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE BUT FIRST I LIFTED MY HEAD TO FILL MY LUNGS WITH THE PURE INVIGORATING NIGHT AIR OF THE MOUNTAINS AS I DID SO I SAW STRETCHING FAR BELOW ME THE BEAUTIFUL VISTA OF ROCKY GORGE AND LEVEL CACTI STUDDED FLAT
NOT A SIGN OF LIFE WAS MANIFEST UPON HER AS SHE DRIFTED SLOWLY WITH THE LIGHT BREEZE IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION SHE WAS DRIFTING SOME FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
OWING TO THE FEAR OF A RETURN ATTACK BY THE AIR CRAFT LORQUAS PTOMEL WAS TOO ASTUTE AN OLD WARRIOR TO BE CAUGHT UPON THE OPEN PLAINS WITH A CARAVAN OF CHARIOTS AND CHILDREN AND SO WE REMAINED AT THE DESERTED CITY UNTIL THE DANGER SEEMED PASSED
I COULD SEE THEM EXAMINING THE DEAD SAILORS EVIDENTLY FOR SIGNS OF LIFE AND PRESENTLY A PARTY OF THEM APPEARED FROM BELOW DRAGGING A LITTLE FIGURE AMONG THEM THE CREATURE WAS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN HALF AS TALL AS THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS
FOR A MAN WHO HAD EVER BEEN USED TO FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE WITH ALL THE ENERGY OF A POWERFUL PHYSIQUE SEVERAL TIMES I THOUGHT I HEARD FAINT SOUNDS BEHIND ME AS OF SOMEBODY MOVING CAUTIOUSLY BUT EVENTUALLY EVEN THESE CEASED
BUT WHERE TO GO AND HOW WAS AS MUCH OF A PUZZLE TO ME AS THE AGE OLD SEARCH FOR THE SPRING OF ETERNAL LIFE HAS BEEN TO EARTHLY MEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME I DECIDED THAT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY I WOULD TAKE SOLA INTO MY CONFIDENCE AND OPENLY ASK HER TO AID ME
THE OTHER VESSELS FOLLOWED IN HER WAKE EACH ONE OPENING UPON US AS SHE SWUNG INTO POSITION OUR OWN FIRE NEVER DIMINISHED AND I DOUBT IF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR SHOTS WENT WILD
ON THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE PRISONER'S VISIT TO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THE CONVERSATION FINALLY FELL UPON THIS SUBJECT AND I WAS ALL EARS ON THE INSTANT I HAD FEARED TO QUESTION SOLA RELATIVE TO THE BEAUTIFUL CAPTIVE
AND AS I EMERGED UPON THE STREET SOLA RUSHED UP TO ME AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF SOME SEARCH ON HER PART THE CAVALCADE WAS RETURNING TO THE PLAZA THE HOMEWARD MARCH HAVING BEEN GIVEN UP FOR THAT DAY NOR IN FACT WAS IT RECOMMENCED FOR MORE THAN A WEEK
I REALIZED I HAD NOT ANSWERED HER SIGNAL AND IGNORANT AS I WAS OF MARTIAN CUSTOMS I INTUITIVELY FELT THAT SHE HAD MADE AN APPEAL FOR SUCCOR AND PROTECTION WHICH MY UNFORTUNATE IGNORANCE HAD PREVENTED ME FROM ANSWERING
UPON THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE STEERING GEAR AND PROPELLERS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST VOLLEY THE GREAT FLEET SWUNG TRAILING OFF IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT HAD FIRST APPEARED SEVERAL OF THE CRAFT WERE LIMPING PERCEPTIBLY
THAT ONE OF THE BRAVES WAS HURLED HEADLONG FROM THE CLIFF TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEIR WILD CRIES ECHOED IN THE CANYON FOR A SHORT TIME AND THEN ALL WAS STILL ONCE MORE THE SOUND WHICH HAD FRIGHTENED THEM WAS NOT REPEATED
ENOUGH ONLY TO SUFFICE FOR MY DAILY NEEDS AS I REACHED THE DOORWAY OF OUR BUILDING A STRANGE SURPRISE AWAITED ME A WARRIOR APPROACHED BEARING THE ARMS ORNAMENTS AND FULL ACCOUTERMENTS OF HIS KIND THESE HE PRESENTED TO ME WITH A FEW UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS
THE CRISP FRESH MOUNTAIN AIR OUTSIDE THE CAVE ACTED AS AN IMMEDIATE TONIC AND I FELT NEW LIFE AND NEW COURAGE COURSING THROUGH ME PAUSING UPON THE BRINK OF THE LEDGE I UPBRAIDED MYSELF FOR WHAT NOW SEEMED TO ME WHOLLY UNWARRANTED APPREHENSION
THAN ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOR AN IMMEDIATE AND HASTY RETURN AS THOUGH TRAINED FOR YEARS IN THIS PARTICULAR EVOLUTION THE GREEN MARTIANS MELTED LIKE MIST INTO THE SPACIOUS DOORWAYS OF THE NEARBY BUILDINGS UNTIL IN LESS THAN THREE MINUTES
FOR EXAMPLE A PROPORTION OF THEM ALWAYS THE BEST MARKSMEN DIRECT THEIR FIRE ENTIRELY UPON THE WIRELESS FINDING AND SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE BIG GUNS OF AN ATTACKING NAVAL FORCE ANOTHER DETAIL ATTENDS TO THE SMALLER GUNS IN THE SAME WAY
SARKOJA AND THE OTHER WOMEN GRUNTED ANGRILY AT THIS EVIDENCE OF WEAKNESS ON THE PART OF SOLA IT IS SAD SOLA THAT YOU WERE NOT BORN A MILLION YEARS AGO SNAPPED SARKOJA WHEN ALL THE HOLLOWS OF THE LAND WERE FILLED WITH WATER
I CLOSED MY EYES STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS TOWARD THE GOD OF MY VOCATION AND FELT MYSELF DRAWN WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF THOUGHT THROUGH THE TRACKLESS IMMENSITY OF SPACE
AND FAR FROM BEING IN A POSITION TO INFLICT HARM UPON US SHE COULD NOT EVEN CONTROL HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE AS SHE NEARED THE CITY THE WARRIORS RUSHED OUT UPON THE PLAIN TO MEET HER
CHAPTER EIGHT A FAIR CAPTIVE FROM THE SKY THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE INCUBATOR CEREMONY WE SET FORTH TOWARD HOME BUT SCARCELY HAD THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION DEBOUCHED INTO THE OPEN GROUND BEFORE THE CITY
AND SEEMED BUT BARELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THEIR DEPLETED CREWS THEIR FIRE HAD CEASED ENTIRELY AND ALL THEIR ENERGIES SEEMED FOCUSED UPON ESCAPE OUR WARRIORS THEN RUSHED UP TO THE ROOFS OF THE BUILDINGS WHICH WE OCCUPIED
BUT I CAN SAY WITHOUT SHAME THAT IF THE SENSATIONS I ENDURED DURING THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WERE FEAR THEN MAY GOD HELP THE COWARD FOR COWARDICE IS OF A SURETY ITS OWN PUNISHMENT TO BE HELD PARALYZED
THE FOREMOST VESSEL SWUNG BROADSIDE TOWARD US AND BRINGING HER GUNS INTO PLAY RETURNED OUR FIRE AT THE SAME TIME MOVING PARALLEL TO OUR FRONT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN TURNING BACK WITH THE EVIDENT INTENTION OF COMPLETING A GREAT CIRCLE WHICH WOULD BRING HER UP TO POSITION ONCE MORE OPPOSITE OUR FIRING LINE
WHILE THE BANNERS AND UPPER WORKS DISSOLVED IN SPURTS OF FLAME AS THE IRRESISTIBLE PROJECTILES OF OUR WARRIORS MOWED THROUGH THEM THE FIRE FROM THE VESSELS WAS MOST INEFFECTUAL OWING AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED
THE DARK AND ANCIENT ISS WHICH CARRIES US TO AN UNKNOWN BUT AT LEAST NO MORE FRIGHTFUL AND TERRIBLE EXISTENCE FORTUNATE INDEED IS HE WHO MEETS HIS END IN AN EARLY DEATH SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE TO TARS TARKAS
I HAD OBSERVED ON THE TWO OCCASIONS WHEN I HAD SEEN HER THAT THE PRISONER EXCHANGED WORDS WITH HER GUARDS AND THIS CONVINCED ME THAT THEY SPOKE
INDEED SAVE FOR HER HIGHLY WROUGHT ORNAMENTS SHE WAS ENTIRELY NAKED NOR COULD ANY APPAREL HAVE ENHANCED THE BEAUTY OF HER PERFECT AND SYMMETRICAL FIGURE AS HER GAZE RESTED ON ME HER EYES OPENED WIDE IN ASTONISHMENT AND SHE MADE A LITTLE SIGN WITH HER FREE HAND
THEY MAKE THE LAWS AS THEY ARE NEEDED A NEW LAW FOR EACH EMERGENCY THEY ARE UNFETTERED BY PRECEDENT IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE CUSTOMS HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN BY AGES OF REPETITION
AND DIMINISHED THE WEIGHT UPON HER ASCENDING TO THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING I WATCHED HER FOR HOURS UNTIL FINALLY SHE WAS LOST IN THE DIM VISTAS OF THE DISTANCE THE SIGHT WAS AWE INSPIRING IN THE EXTREME AS ONE CONTEMPLATED THIS MIGHTY FLOATING FUNERAL PYRE
I HAD NO DESIRE TO FACE THE UNSEEN THING WHICH MENACED ME MY REVOLVERS WERE STRAPPED TO MY LIFELESS BODY WHICH FOR SOME UNFATHOMABLE REASON I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO TOUCH MY CARBINE WAS IN ITS BOOT STRAPPED TO MY SADDLE
AND I WAS LEFT TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF MY POSITION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION I COULD BUT VAGUELY CONJECTURE THE CAUSE OF MY PARALYSIS AND MY ONLY HOPE LAY IN THAT IT MIGHT PASS OFF AS SUDDENLY AS IT HAD FALLEN UPON ME
I FELT IT SAFER TO AFFECT INDIFFERENCE IN THE MATTER UNTIL I LEARNED MORE SURELY SOLA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE OBJECT OF MY SOLICITUDE SARKOJA
AS SOLA AND I ENTERED THE PLAZA A SIGHT MET MY EYES WHICH FILLED MY WHOLE BEING WITH A GREAT SURGE OF MINGLED HOPE FEAR EXULTATION AND DEPRESSION AND YET MOST DOMINANT WAS A SUBTLE SENSE OF RELIEF AND HAPPINESS
IN THE DARKNESS OF THE CAVE AND TO MY DISTORTED IMAGINATION TO BE CREEPING STEALTHILY UPON ME UNABLE LONGER TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO ESCAPE THIS HORRIBLE PLACE I LEAPED QUICKLY THROUGH THE OPENING INTO THE STARLIGHT OF A CLEAR ARIZONA NIGHT
CONVINCED ME THAT THE NOISES I HAD HEARD MUST HAVE RESULTED FROM PURELY NATURAL AND HARMLESS CAUSES
WROUGHT BY THE MOONLIGHT INTO A MIRACLE OF SOFT SPLENDOR AND WONDROUS ENCHANTMENT FEW WESTERN WONDERS ARE MORE INSPIRING THAN THE BEAUTIES OF AN ARIZONA MOONLIT LANDSCAPE THE SILVERED MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
THE STRANGE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS UPON HOG BACK AND ARROYO AND THE GROTESQUE DETAILS OF THE STIFF YET BEAUTIFUL CACTI FORM A PICTURE AT ONCE ENCHANTING AND INSPIRING AS THOUGH ONE WERE CATCHING FOR THE FIRST TIME A GLIMPSE OF SOME DEAD AND FORGOTTEN WORLD
AS THE CRAFT NEARED THE BUILDING AND JUST BEFORE SHE STRUCK THE MARTIAN WARRIORS SWARMED UPON HER FROM THE WINDOWS AND WITH THEIR GREAT SPEARS EASED THE SHOCK OF THE COLLISION
IT IS ONLY THE MEN OF HER KIND WHO WAR UPON US AND I HAVE EVER THOUGHT THAT THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD US IS BUT THE REFLECTION OF OURS TOWARD THEM THEY LIVE AT PEACE WITH ALL THEIR FELLOWS EXCEPT WHEN DUTY CALLS UPON THEM TO MAKE WAR WHILE WE ARE AT PEACE WITH NONE
WHICH LAY JUST WITHIN MY RANGE OF VISION UPON THE LEDGE WHERE I HAD PLACED IT IN THE EARLY MORNING FROM THEN UNTIL POSSIBLY MIDNIGHT ALL WAS SILENCE THE SILENCE OF THE DEAD THEN SUDDENLY THE AWFUL MOAN OF THE MORNING BROKE UPON MY STARTLED EARS
IS THIS THEN DEATH HAVE I INDEED PASSED OVER FOREVER INTO THAT OTHER LIFE BUT I COULD NOT WELL BELIEVE THIS AS I COULD FEEL MY HEART POUNDING AGAINST MY RIBS FROM THE EXERTION OF MY EFFORTS TO RELEASE MYSELF FROM THE ANAESTHESIS WHICH HAD HELD ME
AND YET HERE I STOOD BUT NAKED AS AT THE MINUTE OF MY BIRTH THE TRANSITION HAD BEEN SO SUDDEN AND SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT LEFT ME FOR A MOMENT FORGETFUL OF AUGHT ELSE THAN MY STRANGE METAMORPHOSIS MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS
AFTER THE LAST LOAD HAD BEEN REMOVED THE WARRIORS MADE LINES FAST TO THE CRAFT AND TOWED HER FAR OUT INTO THE VALLEY IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION A FEW OF THEM THEN BOARDED HER AND WERE BUSILY ENGAGED IN WHAT APPEARED FROM MY DISTANT POSITION
BUT IT HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT AS IT WAS TO START ME SPECULATING ON THE POSSIBLE HORROR WHICH LURKED IN THE SHADOWS AT MY BACK FEAR IS A RELATIVE TERM AND SO I CAN ONLY MEASURE MY FEELINGS AT THAT TIME BY WHAT I HAD EXPERIENCED IN PREVIOUS POSITIONS OF DANGER AND BY THOSE THAT I HAVE PASSED THROUGH SINCE
WITH THIS ADDED INCENTIVE I NEARLY DROVE SOLA DISTRACTED BY MY IMPORTUNITIES TO HASTEN ON MY EDUCATION AND WITHIN A FEW MORE DAYS I HAD MASTERED THE MARTIAN TONGUE SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO ENABLE ME TO CARRY ON A PASSABLE CONVERSATION
HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE AUDIENCE AS ONE OF THE CAPTIVE'S GUARDS AND IT WAS TOWARD HER THE QUESTION TURNED WHEN ASKED ONE OF THE WOMEN WILL WE ENJOY THE DEATH THROES OF THE RED ONE OR DOES LORQUAS PTOMEL JED INTEND HOLDING HER FOR RANSOM
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON MY HORSE WHICH HAD BEEN STANDING WITH DRAGGING REIN BEFORE THE CAVE STARTED SLOWLY DOWN THE TRAIL EVIDENTLY IN SEARCH OF FOOD AND WATER AND I WAS LEFT ALONE WITH MY MYSTERIOUS UNKNOWN COMPANION AND THE DEAD BODY OF MY FRIEND
AS I COULD NOT BUT RECALL THE STRANGE EXPRESSION I HAD NOTED UPON HER FACE AFTER MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE PRISONER THAT IT DENOTED JEALOUSY I COULD NOT SAY AND YET JUDGING ALL THINGS BY MUNDANE STANDARDS AS I STILL DID
AND THE GREAT WARSHIP LIGHTENED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE LOOT SOARED MAJESTICALLY INTO THE AIR HER DECKS AND UPPER WORKS A MASS OF ROARING FLAMES SLOWLY SHE DRIFTED TO THE SOUTHEAST RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER AS THE FLAMES ATE AWAY HER WOODEN PARTS
THE ENGLISHMAN NODDED BUT GAVE NO INDICATION WHETHER HE INTENDED TO ACCEPT THIS CHALLENGE OR NOT ANATOLE DID NOT RELEASE HIM AND THOUGH HE KEPT NODDING TO SHOW THAT HE UNDERSTOOD ANATOLE WENT ON TRANSLATING DOLOKHOV'S WORDS INTO ENGLISH
PRODUCED TO MY FEELINGS AN EFFECT FOR WHICH I NEVER COULD ACCOUNT THE EFFECT WAS THAT IT REFLECTED BACK UPON THE MURDER A PECULIAR AWFULNESS AND A DEPTH OF SOLEMNITY
DID ACTUALLY OCCUR WHICH THE GENIUS OF SHAKSPEARE HAS INVENTED AND ALL GOOD JUDGES AND THE MOST EMINENT DILETTANTI ACKNOWLEDGED THE FELICITY OF SHAKSPEARE'S SUGGESTION
THE MAN WHO HAD WISHED TO STOP THE AFFAIR RAN TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM AND THREW HIMSELF ON A SOFA WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL PIERRE HID HIS FACE FROM WHICH A FAINT SMILE FORGOT TO FADE THOUGH HIS FEATURES NOW EXPRESSED HORROR AND FEAR ALL WERE STILL
FROM MY BOYISH DAYS I HAD ALWAYS FELT A GREAT PERPLEXITY ON ONE POINT IN MACBETH IT WAS THIS THE KNOCKING AT THE GATE WHICH SUCCEEDS TO THE MURDER OF DUNCAN
SHE WOULD TALK ABOUT WILLIAM THE SILENT ABOUT GUSTAVE THE LOQUACIOUS ABOUT PARIS FROCKS ABOUT HOW THE POOR DRESSED IN THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ABOUT FANTIN LATOUR
THE LINES OF THAT MOUTH WERE REMARKABLY FINELY CURVED THE MIDDLE OF THE UPPER LIP FORMED A SHARP WEDGE AND CLOSED FIRMLY ON THE FIRM LOWER ONE
AND MADE PALPABLE IN ORDER THAT A NEW WORLD MAY STEP IN THIS WORLD MUST FOR A TIME DISAPPEAR THE MURDERERS AND THE MURDER MUST BE INSULATED
HIS HEAD AND ARM WAVERED STILL MORE WITH THE STRAIN ONE HAND MOVED AS IF TO CLUTCH THE WINDOW SILL BUT REFRAINED FROM TOUCHING IT PIERRE AGAIN COVERED HIS EYES AND THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER OPEN THEM AGAIN SUDDENLY HE WAS AWARE OF A STIR ALL AROUND HE LOOKED UP
THE BOTTLE OF RUM WAS BROUGHT THE WINDOW FRAME WHICH PREVENTED ANYONE FROM SITTING ON THE OUTER SILL WAS BEING FORCED OUT BY TWO FOOTMEN WHO WERE EVIDENTLY FLURRIED AND INTIMIDATED BY THE DIRECTIONS AND SHOUTS OF THE GENTLEMEN AROUND
SHE SEEMED TO DANCE OVER THE FLOORS OF CASTLES AND OVER SEAS AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER THE SALONS OF MODISTES AND OVER THE PLAGES OF THE RIVIERA LIKE A GAY TREMULOUS BEAM REFLECTED FROM WATER UPON A CEILING
OUR SYMPATHY MUST BE WITH HIM OF COURSE I MEAN A SYMPATHY OF COMPREHENSION A SYMPATHY BY WHICH WE ENTER INTO HIS FEELINGS AND ARE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THEM
AND CHANCING TO WALK NEAR THE COURSE THROUGH WHICH IT PASSED HAS FELT POWERFULLY IN THE SILENCE AND DESERTION OF THE STREETS AND IN THE STAGNATION OF ORDINARY BUSINESS THE DEEP INTEREST WHICH AT THAT MOMENT WAS POSSESSING THE HEART OF MAN
IN ORDINARY CASES WHERE THE SYMPATHY IS WHOLLY DIRECTED TO THE CASE OF THE MURDERED PERSON IS AN INCIDENT OF COARSE AND VULGAR HORROR AND FOR THIS REASON THAT IT FLINGS THE INTEREST EXCLUSIVELY UPON THE NATURAL
HAVE A TALK WITH HIM AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS CAME ONE FROM LEONORA SAYING YES PLEASE DO COME YOU COULD BE SO HELPFUL IT WAS AS IF HE HAD SENT THE CABLE WITHOUT CONSULTING HER AND HAD AFTERWARDS TOLD HER INDEED THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH WHAT HAD HAPPENED EXCEPT THAT
FOR THE SAKE OF GRATIFYING HIS OWN ENORMOUS AND TEEMING FACULTY OF CREATION SHAKSPEARE HAS INTRODUCED TWO MURDERERS AND AS USUAL IN HIS HANDS THEY ARE REMARKABLY DISCRIMINATED
OR SOMETHING SO EXTRAORDINARY MAY HAPPEN TO ONE THAT HONOR AND DISHONOR WILL BE ALL THE SAME PIERRE OFTEN INDULGED IN REFLECTIONS OF THIS SORT NULLIFYING ALL HIS DECISIONS AND INTENTIONS HE WENT TO KURAGIN'S
THAT IS WHAT MAKES ME THINK OF THAT FELLOW PEIRE VIDAL BECAUSE OF COURSE HIS STORY IS CULTURE AND I HAD TO HEAD HER TOWARDS CULTURE AND AT THE SAME TIME IT'S SO FUNNY AND SHE HADN'T GOT TO LAUGH AND IT'S SO FULL OF LOVE AND SHE WASN'T TO THINK OF LOVE
HAIL STORM AND THUNDER WHICH ARE TO BE STUDIED WITH ENTIRE SUBMISSION OF OUR OWN FACULTIES AND IN THE PERFECT FAITH THAT IN THEM THERE CAN BE NO TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE NOTHING USELESS OR INERT
I MEAN THAT SHE DIDN'T LOOK AS IF SHE WERE SEEING POETIC DREAMS OR LOOKING THROUGH YOU FOR SHE HARDLY EVER DID LOOK AT YOU HOLDING UP ONE HAND AS IF SHE WISHED TO SILENCE ANY OBJECTION OR ANY COMMENT FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SHE WOULD TALK
AND HALF A DOZEN FOLDING CHAIRS IN A SPECIAL CASE THAT HE ALWAYS KEPT IN HIS CABIN THERE MUST HAVE BEEN HALF A CARGO OF FRUIT FOR TO EVERY PERSON ON BOARD THE SEVERAL STEAMERS THAT THEY EMPLOYED TO EVERY PERSON WITH WHOM HE HAD SO MUCH AS A NODDING ACQUAINTANCE
TO REPRESENT THE EFFECT OF TWO WALLS STANDING AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER OR THE APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES ON EACH SIDE OF A STREET AS SEEN BY A PERSON LOOKING DOWN THE STREET FROM ONE EXTREMITY NOW IN ALL CASES
THE ANIMAL'S ACTION ITS HIGH STEPPING ITS SKIN THAT WAS LIKE SATIN AND THE PEACE AND THE RED CHEEKS AND THE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL OLD HOUSE JUST NEAR BRANSHAW TELERAGH IT WAS
ANATOLE WITH HIS SWAGGERING AIR STRODE UP TO THE WINDOW HE WANTED TO SMASH SOMETHING PUSHING AWAY THE FOOTMEN HE TUGGED AT THE FRAME BUT COULD NOT MOVE IT HE SMASHED A PANE
ALL STRIFE OF THOUGHT ALL FLUX AND REFLUX OF PASSION AND OF PURPOSE ARE CRUSHED BY ONE OVERWHELMING PANIC THE FEAR OF INSTANT DEATH SMITES HIM WITH ITS PETRIFIC MACE
AND IT STRUCK HIM THAT THE THINGS TO TAKE FOR THAT PURPOSE WERE ORANGES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THE ORANGE COUNTRY AND COMFORTABLE FOLDING CHAIRS SO HE BOUGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CASES OF ORANGES THE GREAT COOL CALIFORNIA ORANGES
THIS WAS TO BE EXPRESSED AND ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT AS WELL AS TO MAKE IT A MORE PROPORTIONABLE ANTAGONIST TO THE UNOFFENDING NATURE OF THEIR VICTIM THE GRACIOUS DUNCAN AND ADEQUATELY TO EXPOUND THE
HE GAVE AN ORANGE EVERY MORNING AND THEY LASTED HIM RIGHT ROUND THE GIRDLE OF THIS MIGHTY GLOBE OF OURS WHEN THEY WERE AT NORTH CAPE EVEN HE SAW ON THE HORIZON POOR DEAR THIN MAN THAT HE WAS A LIGHTHOUSE
BENEATH THE TALLNESS OF THE STONE PINES WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING THE STONE PINE IS NO WE NEVER DID GO BACK ANYWHERE NOT TO HEIDELBERG NOT TO HAMELIN NOT TO VERONA NOT TO MONT MAJOUR
NOT SO MUCH AS TO CARCASSONNE ITSELF WE TALKED OF IT OF COURSE BUT I GUESS FLORENCE GOT ALL SHE WANTED OUT OF ONE LOOK AT A PLACE SHE HAD THE SEEING EYE I HAVEN'T UNFORTUNATELY SO THAT THE WORLD IS FULL OF PLACES TO WHICH I WANT TO RETURN
IT HAD CERTAINLY JUMPED OR SQUEAKED OR SOMETHING JUST SUFFICIENTLY TO TAKE IN THE DOCTORS BUT IT APPEARS THAT THAT WAS BECAUSE OF AN ODD FORMATION OF THE LUNGS I DON'T MUCH UNDERSTAND ABOUT THESE MATTERS
THIS TOGETHER WITH THE RESOLUTE INSOLENT INTELLIGENCE OF HIS EYES PRODUCED AN EFFECT WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO NOTICE HIS FACE DOLOKHOV WAS A MAN OF SMALL MEANS AND NO CONNECTIONS
ARRANGED HIMSELF ON HIS SEAT IF ANYONE COMES MEDDLING AGAIN SAID HE EMITTING THE WORDS SEPARATELY THROUGH HIS THIN COMPRESSED LIPS I WILL THROW HIM DOWN THERE NOW THEN SAYING THIS HE AGAIN TURNED ROUND
AND THE HAND HOLDING THE BOTTLE WAS LIFTED HIGHER AND HIGHER AND TREMBLED WITH THE EFFORT THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTYING PERCEPTIBLY AND RISING STILL HIGHER AND HIS HEAD TILTING YET FURTHER BACK WHY IS IT SO LONG THOUGHT PIERRE
AND THE MOST TO BE DISTRUSTED AND YET THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE TRUST TO NOTHING ELSE WHICH MAY DO FOR ORDINARY LIFE BUT NOT FOR PHILOSOPHICAL PURPOSES OF THIS OUT OF TEN THOUSAND INSTANCES THAT I MIGHT PRODUCE
DOLOKHOV COULD PLAY ALL GAMES AND NEARLY ALWAYS WON HOWEVER MUCH HE DRANK HE NEVER LOST HIS CLEARHEADEDNESS BOTH KURAGIN AND DOLOKHOV WERE AT THAT TIME NOTORIOUS AMONG THE RAKES AND SCAPEGRACES OF PETERSBURG
YOU ARE SO SILENT YOU DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING I AM AT ANY RATE TRYING TO GET YOU TO SEE WHAT SORT OF LIFE IT WAS I LED WITH FLORENCE AND WHAT FLORENCE WAS LIKE WELL SHE WAS BRIGHT AND SHE DANCED
WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TRY AND TELL THE STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AS IF IT WERE A STORY OR WHETHER TO TELL IT FROM THIS DISTANCE OF TIME AS IT REACHED ME FROM THE LIPS OF LEONORA OR FROM THOSE OF EDWARD HIMSELF
I KNOW I WAS FOR DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY WHOLE ATTENTIONS MY WHOLE ENDEAVOURS WERE TO KEEP POOR DEAR FLORENCE ON TO TOPICS LIKE THE FINDS AT CNOSSOS AND THE MENTAL SPIRITUALITY OF WALTER PATER
JUMPED ONTO THE WINDOW SILL LISTEN CRIED HE STANDING THERE AND ADDRESSING THOSE IN THE ROOM ALL WERE SILENT
THE ENGLISHMAN TOOK OUT HIS PURSE AND BEGAN COUNTING OUT THE MONEY DOLOKHOV STOOD FROWNING AND DID NOT SPEAK PIERRE JUMPED UPON THE WINDOW SILL GENTLEMEN
IN WHICH NOT ONLY THE UNDERSTANDING IS ALLOWED TO OVERRULE THE EYES BUT WHERE THE UNDERSTANDING IS POSITIVELY ALLOWED TO OBLITERATE THE EYES AS IT WERE
CARDS AND SUPPER WERE OVER BUT THE VISITORS HAD NOT YET DISPERSED PIERRE THREW OFF HIS CLOAK AND ENTERED THE FIRST ROOM IN WHICH WERE THE REMAINS OF SUPPER A FOOTMAN THINKING NO ONE SAW HIM
AND THE IMMENSE MISTRAL BLEW DOWN THAT VALLEY WHICH WAS THE WAY FROM FRANCE INTO PROVENCE SO THAT THE SILVER GREY OLIVE LEAVES APPEARED LIKE HAIR FLYING IN THE WIND
ANATOLE BROUGHT TWO CANDLES AND PLACED THEM ON THE WINDOW SILL THOUGH IT WAS ALREADY QUITE LIGHT DOLOKHOV'S BACK IN HIS WHITE SHIRT AND HIS CURLY HEAD WERE LIT UP FROM BOTH SIDES EVERYONE CROWDED TO THE WINDOW THE ENGLISHMAN IN FRONT
HIS UNDERSTANDING WHICH INCLUDES NO INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAWS OF VISION CAN FURNISH HIM WITH NO REASON WHY A LINE WHICH IS KNOWN AND CAN BE PROVED TO BE A HORIZONTAL LINE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A HORIZONTAL LINE
I DIDN'T SEE ANY CALL TO DO IT WHY DOES ONE DO THINGS I JUST DRIFTED IN AND WANTED FLORENCE
HE HAD TOLD THE GIRL AND THE GIRL TOLD THE WIFE I ARRIVED HOWEVER TOO LATE TO BE OF ANY GOOD IF I COULD HAVE BEEN OF ANY GOOD AND THEN I HAD MY FIRST TASTE OF ENGLISH LIFE IT WAS AMAZING IT WAS OVERWHELMING
AND SHE WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM SO OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO HER THE THINGS PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY'RE IN LOVE HE DRESSED HIMSELF UP IN WOLFSKINS AND WENT UP INTO THE BLACK MOUNTAINS AND THE
UNLESS THE PERSON HAS HAPPENED TO OBSERVE IN PICTURES HOW IT IS THAT ARTISTS PRODUCE THESE EFFECTS HE WILL BE UTTERLY UNABLE TO MAKE THE SMALLEST APPROXIMATION TO IT YET WHY
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT WAIT A BIT HE IS NOT DRUNK YET A BOTTLE HERE SAID ANATOLE TAKING A GLASS FROM THE TABLE HE WENT UP TO PIERRE FIRST OF ALL YOU MUST DRINK PIERRE DRANK ONE GLASS AFTER ANOTHER
TOWNS WITH THE BLINDING WHITE SUN UPON THEM STONE PINES AGAINST THE BLUE OF THE SKY CORNERS OF GABLES ALL CARVED AND PAINTED WITH STAGS AND SCARLET FLOWERS AND CROWSTEPPED GABLES WITH THE LITTLE SAINT AT THE TOP
LOOKING FROM UNDER HIS BROWS AT THE TIPSY GUESTS WHO WERE AGAIN CROWDING ROUND THE WINDOW AND LISTENING TO THEIR CHATTER ANATOLE KEPT ON REFILLING PIERRE'S GLASS WHILE EXPLAINING THAT DOLOKHOV WAS BETTING WITH STEVENS AN ENGLISH NAVAL OFFICER
EMPTY HE THREW THE BOTTLE TO THE ENGLISHMAN WHO CAUGHT IT NEATLY DOLOKHOV JUMPED DOWN HE SMELT STRONGLY OF RUM WELL DONE FINE FELLOW THERE'S A BET FOR YOU DEVIL TAKE YOU CAME FROM DIFFERENT SIDES
ONE OF THE FOOTMEN WHO HAD STOOPED TO PICK UP SOME BROKEN GLASS REMAINED IN THAT POSITION WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THE WINDOW AND FROM DOLOKHOV'S BACK ANATOLE STOOD ERECT WITH STARING EYES
PERHAPS IF IT WEREN'T SO I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO CATCH HOLD OF NOW IS ALL THIS DIGRESSION OR ISN'T IT DIGRESSION AGAIN I DON'T KNOW YOU THE LISTENER SIT OPPOSITE ME BUT
HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS SEEN
AND THE HUSBAND HAD TO KNEEL DOWN AND KISS HIS FEET THOUGH LA LOUVE WOULDN'T AND PEIRE SET SAIL IN A ROWING BOAT WITH FOUR COMPANIONS TO REDEEM THE HOLY SEPULCHRE AND THEY STRUCK ON A ROCK SOMEWHERE AND AT GREAT EXPENSE THE HUSBAND HAD TO FIT OUT AN EXPEDITION TO FETCH HIM BACK AND
A TALL HANDSOME FELLOW WHO STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THE GROUP WITHOUT A COAT AND WITH HIS FINE LINEN SHIRT UNFASTENED IN FRONT WAIT A BIT YOU FELLOWS HERE IS PETYA GOOD MAN CRIED HE ADDRESSING PIERRE
BEGAN REPEATING THE TERMS OF THE WAGER TO HIM IN ENGLISH WAIT CRIED DOLOKHOV HAMMERING WITH THE BOTTLE ON THE WINDOW SILL TO ATTRACT ATTENTION WAIT A BIT KURAGIN LISTEN
WHICH WILL CREATE A HELL WITHIN HIM AND INTO THIS HELL WE ARE TO LOOK FOOTNOTE ONE
BUT THOUGH IN MACBETH THE STRIFE OF MIND IS GREATER THAN IN HIS WIFE THE TIGER SPIRIT NOT SO AWAKE AND HIS FEELINGS CAUGHT CHIEFLY BY CONTAGION FROM HER
SHE WAS YET A GRADUATE OF POUGHKEEPSIE I NEVER COULD IMAGINE HOW SHE DID IT THE QUEER CHATTERY PERSON THAT SHE WAS WITH THE FAR AWAY LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH WASN'T HOWEVER IN THE LEAST ROMANTIC
AND I AGAIN SET MYSELF TO STUDY THE PROBLEM AT LENGTH I SOLVED IT TO MY OWN SATISFACTION AND MY SOLUTION IS THIS MURDER
THEN THE WORLD OF DARKNESS PASSES AWAY LIKE A PAGEANTRY IN THE CLOUDS THE KNOCKING AT THE GATE IS HEARD AND IT MAKES KNOWN AUDIBLY THAT THE REACTION HAS COMMENCED THE HUMAN HAS MADE ITS REFLUX UPON THE FIENDISH
AND SO GUARDED AGAINST HIS HEART AND HAVING HIS NIECE WITH HIM HE WENT ROUND THE WORLD HE WASN'T OBTRUSIVE ABOUT HIS HEART YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN HE HAD ONE HE ONLY LEFT IT TO THE PHYSICAL LABORATORY AT WATERBURY FOR THE BENEFIT OF SCIENCE
PEIRE VIDAL FELL ALL OVER THE LADY'S BED WHILE THE HUSBAND WHO WAS A MOST FEROCIOUS WARRIOR REMONSTRATED SOME MORE ABOUT THE COURTESY THAT IS DUE TO GREAT POETS BUT I SUPPOSE LA LOUVE WAS THE MORE FEROCIOUS OF THE TWO ANYHOW
IT SEEMS ALMOST LUDICROUS TO GUARD AND EXPLAIN MY USE OF A WORD IN A SITUATION WHERE IT WOULD NATURALLY EXPLAIN ITSELF BUT IT HAS BECOME NECESSARY TO DO SO IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNSCHOLARLIKE USE OF THE WORD SYMPATHY
THIN GENTLE AND WITH A HEART THAT MADE HIS LIFE VERY MUCH WHAT FLORENCE'S AFTERWARDS BECAME HE DIDN'T RESIDE AT STAMFORD HIS HOME WAS IN WATERBURY WHERE THE WATCHES COME FROM
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED SUDDENLY DOLOKHOV MADE A BACKWARD MOVEMENT WITH HIS SPINE AND HIS ARM TREMBLED NERVOUSLY THIS WAS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE HIS WHOLE BODY TO SLIP AS HE SAT ON THE SLOPING LEDGE AS HE BEGAN SLIPPING DOWN
IF THE READER HAS EVER WITNESSED A WIFE DAUGHTER OR SISTER IN A FAINTING FIT
FIFTY IMPERIALS HE SPOKE FRENCH THAT THE ENGLISHMAN MIGHT UNDERSTAND HIM BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK IT VERY WELL I BET FIFTY IMPERIALS OR DO YOU WISH TO MAKE IT A HUNDRED ADDED HE ADDRESSING THE ENGLISHMAN NO
THE GIRL WAS OUT WITH THE HOUNDS I THINK AND THAT POOR DEVIL BESIDE ME WAS IN AN AGONY
THESE FELLOWS MUST BE VERY LONELY LET'S TAKE THEM SOME ORANGES SO HE HAD A BOATLOAD OF HIS FRUIT OUT AND HAD HIMSELF ROWED TO THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE HORIZON THE FOLDING CHAIRS HE LENT TO ANY LADY THAT HE CAME ACROSS AND LIKED OR WHO SEEMED TIRED AND INVALIDISH ON THE SHIP
HE HAD TO KEEP HIM FOR INSTANCE OUT OF POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS
I'LL DRINK IT LET'S HAVE A BOTTLE OF RUM SHOUTED PIERRE BANGING THE TABLE WITH A DETERMINED AND DRUNKEN GESTURE AND PREPARING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE WINDOW
AND MADE SENSIBLE ANOTHER WORLD HAS STEPPED IN
WHICH IS IN THE BLACK MOUNTAINS IN THE MIDDLE OF A TORTUOUS VALLEY THERE RISES UP AN IMMENSE PINNACLE AND ON THE PINNACLE ARE FOUR CASTLES LAS TOURS THE TOWERS
THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DOING SINCE HIS TIME OR NOTHING THAT'S WORTH SPEAKING OF BUT THIS IS WRONG FOR IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT ALL MEN TO BE GREAT ARTISTS AND BORN WITH THE GENIUS OF MISTER WILLIAMS
HE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE IN FORMING THE CHARACTER OF MY POOR DEAR WIFE JUST BEFORE THEY SET OUT FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR THE SOUTH SEAS
THAT A STORY YOU HAVEN'T AN IDEA OF THE QUEER OLD FASHIONEDNESS OF FLORENCE'S AUNTS THE MISSES HURLBIRD NOR YET OF HER UNCLE AN EXTRAORDINARILY LOVABLE MAN THAT UNCLE JOHN
LAS TOURS OF THE FOUR CASTLES HAD
AFTER WHICH THERE WAS GENERALLY A DRINKING BOUT FINISHING WITH VISITS OF A KIND PIERRE WAS VERY FOND OF
AND DISSATISFIED BY ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SINCE DONE IN THAT LINE ALL OTHER MURDERS LOOK PALE BY THE DEEP CRIMSON OF HIS AND AS AN AMATEUR ONCE SAID TO ME IN A QUERULOUS TONE
THE FACT IS THAT THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WEAK AND FLUTTERING HEART DIDN'T WANT HIS FACTORY TO MANUFACTURE ANYTHING AT ALL HE WANTED TO RETIRE AND HE DID RETIRE WHEN HE WAS SEVENTY BUT HE WAS SO WORRIED AT HAVING ALL THE STREET BOYS IN THE TOWN POINT AFTER HIM AND EXCLAIM
RELATION TO THINGS WITHOUT ABOLISHED AND ALL MUST PASS SELF WITHDRAWN INTO A DEEP SYNCOPE AND SUSPENSION OF EARTHLY PASSION HENCE IT IS THAT WHEN THE DEED IS DONE WHEN THE WORK OF DARKNESS IS PERFECT
I'LL DO THE SAME THING HE SUDDENLY CRIED EVEN WITHOUT A BET THERE TELL THEM TO BRING ME A BOTTLE I'LL DO IT BRING A BOTTLE LET HIM DO IT LET HIM DO IT SAID DOLOKHOV SMILING WHAT NEXT HAVE YOU GONE MAD NO ONE WOULD LET YOU WHY
FOR NINE MONTHS OR SO IT WOULD MANUFACTURE BUTTONS OUT OF BONE THEN IT WOULD SUDDENLY PRODUCE BRASS BUTTONS FOR COACHMEN'S LIVERIES THEN IT WOULD TAKE A TURN AT EMBOSSED TIN LIDS FOR CANDY BOXES
OVER THE RHONE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT BEAUCAIRE WE NEVER DID TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT BEAUCAIRE OF COURSE BEAUTIFUL BEAUCAIRE WITH THE HIGH TRIANGULAR WHITE TOWER THAT LOOKED AS THIN AS A NEEDLE AND AS TALL AS THE FLATIRON BETWEEN FIFTH AND BROADWAY
DROPPED HIS HANDS TOOK THE BOTTLE AND LIFTED IT TO HIS LIPS THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND RAISED HIS FREE HAND TO BALANCE HIMSELF
STOOD ON THE TOP DOORSTEP WITH A BUTLER AND FOOTMAN AND A MAID OR SO BEHIND HER AND SHE JUST SAID SO GLAD YOU'VE COME AS IF I'D RUN DOWN TO LUNCH FROM A TOWN TEN MILES AWAY INSTEAD OF HAVING COME HALF THE WORLD OVER AT THE CALL OF TWO URGENT TELEGRAMS
I SHOULD LIKE TO GO TO KURAGIN'S THOUGHT HE BUT HE IMMEDIATELY RECALLED HIS PROMISE TO PRINCE ANDREW NOT TO GO THERE THEN AS HAPPENS TO PEOPLE OF WEAK CHARACTER
AND THE TUFTS OF ROSEMARY CREPT INTO THE IRON ROCKS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE TORN UP BY THE ROOTS IT WAS OF COURSE POOR DEAR FLORENCE WHO WANTED TO GO TO LAS TOURS
EXHIBITS HUMAN NATURE IN ITS MOST ABJECT AND HUMILIATING ATTITUDE SUCH AN ATTITUDE WOULD LITTLE SUIT THE PURPOSES OF THE POET WHAT THEN MUST HE DO HE MUST THROW THE INTEREST ON THE MURDERER
THAT IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THAT ANYTHING ESSENTIALLY CALAMITOUS COULD HAPPEN TO THAT PLACE AND THOSE PEOPLE I TELL YOU IT WAS THE VERY SPIRIT OF PEACE AND LEONORA BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING WITH HER COILS OF YELLOW HAIR
WHICH WAS THEN STILL RESIDENTIAL I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAD GONE TO NEW YORK I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAD GONE TO THE TEA I DON'T SEE WHY FLORENCE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THAT SORT OF SPELLING BEE
BUT IGNOBLE INSTINCT BY WHICH WE CLEAVE TO LIFE AN INSTINCT WHICH AS BEING INDISPENSABLE TO THE PRIMAL LAW OF SELF PRESERVATION
HE STOOPED AND POINTED TO THE SLOPING LEDGE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND WITHOUT HOLDING ON TO ANYTHING IS THAT RIGHT QUITE RIGHT SAID THE ENGLISHMAN ANATOLE TURNED TO THE ENGLISHMAN AND TAKING HIM BY ONE OF THE BUTTONS OF HIS COAT
PIERRE STOOD SMILING BUT SILENT ONE MAN OLDER THAN THE OTHERS PRESENT SUDDENLY PUSHED FORWARD WITH A SCARED AND ANGRY LOOK AND WANTED TO SEIZE HOLD OF DOLOKHOV'S SHIRT I SAY THIS IS FOLLY HE'LL BE KILLED SAID THIS MORE SENSIBLE MAN
BENEATH THE HIGH THIN LEAVED ELMS THE FIRST QUESTION THEY ASKED ME WAS NOT HOW I DID BUT WHAT DID I DO AND I DID NOTHING
ANATOLE STOPPED HIM DON'T TOUCH HIM YOU'LL STARTLE HIM AND THEN HE'LL BE KILLED EH WHAT THEN EH
AT LENGTH IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE MISTER WILLIAMS MADE HIS DEBUT ON THE STAGE OF RATCLIFFE HIGHWAY AND EXECUTED THOSE UNPARALLELED MURDERS WHICH HAVE PROCURED FOR HIM SUCH A BRILLIANT AND UNDYING REPUTATION
I WILL CITE ONE ASK OF ANY PERSON WHATSOEVER WHO IS NOT PREVIOUSLY PREPARED FOR THE DEMAND BY A KNOWLEDGE OF PERSPECTIVE TO DRAW IN THE RUDEST WAY THE COMMONEST APPEARANCE WHICH DEPENDS UPON THE LAWS OF THAT SCIENCE AS FOR INSTANCE
I GUESS FLORENCE WANTED TO RAISE THE CULTURE OF THE STUYVESANT CROWD AND DID IT AS SHE MIGHT HAVE GONE IN SLUMMING INTELLECTUAL SLUMMING THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO LEAVE THE WORLD A LITTLE MORE ELEVATED THAN SHE FOUND IT POOR DEAR THING
THEY ARE TRANSFIGURED LADY MACBETH IS UNSEXED MACBETH HAS FORGOT THAT HE WAS BORN OF WOMAN BOTH ARE CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF DEVILS AND THE WORLD OF DEVILS IS SUDDENLY REVEALED
AND MADE APPREHENSIBLE BY REACTION NOW APPLY THIS TO THE CASE IN MACBETH HERE AS I HAVE SAID
AND I HAD TO APPOINT TRUSTEES I DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF THEIR NOT BEING PROPERLY HANDLED YES IT WAS A GREAT WORRY AND JUST AS I HAD GOT THINGS ROUGHLY SETTLED I RECEIVED THE EXTRAORDINARY CABLE FROM ASHBURNHAM BEGGING ME TO COME BACK AND
NOW IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IN THE FIRST OF THESE MURDERS THAT OF THE MARRS THE SAME INCIDENT
AND GREY AND PINK PALAZZI AND WALLED TOWNS A MILE OR SO BACK FROM THE SEA ON THE MEDITERRANEAN BETWEEN LEGHORN AND NAPLES NOT ONE OF THEM DID WE SEE MORE THAN ONCE
HE DESIRED SO PASSIONATELY ONCE MORE TO ENJOY THAT DISSIPATION HE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THAT HE DECIDED TO GO THE THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HIS PROMISE TO PRINCE ANDREW WAS OF NO ACCOUNT
EMOTIONS WERE REALLY STIRRED HER LITTLE HEART MIGHT CEASE TO BEAT FOR TWELVE YEARS I HAD TO WATCH EVERY WORD THAT ANY PERSON UTTERED IN ANY CONVERSATION AND I HAD TO HEAD IT OFF WHAT THE ENGLISH CALL THINGS OFF LOVE POVERTY CRIME
SOME EIGHT OR NINE YOUNG MEN WERE CROWDING ANXIOUSLY ROUND AN OPEN WINDOW THREE OTHERS WERE ROMPING WITH A YOUNG BEAR ONE PULLING HIM BY THE CHAIN AND TRYING TO SET HIM AT THE OTHERS I BET A HUNDRED ON STEVENS SHOUTED ONE
BUT IN THE MURDERER SUCH A MURDERER AS A POET WILL CONDESCEND TO THERE MUST BE RAGING SOME GREAT STORM OF PASSION JEALOUSY AMBITION VENGEANCE HATRED
THEY POLISHED HIM UP AND HER HUSBAND REMONSTRATED SERIOUSLY WITH HER VIDAL WAS YOU SEE A GREAT POET AND IT WAS NOT PROPER TO TREAT A GREAT POET WITH INDIFFERENCE SO PEIRE VIDAL DECLARED HIMSELF EMPEROR OF JERUSALEM OR SOMEWHERE
I HAVE HEARD HER LECTURE TEDDY ASHBURNHAM BY THE HOUR ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FRANZ HALS AND A WOUVERMANS AND WHY THE PRE MYCENAEAN STATUES WERE CUBICAL WITH KNOBS ON THE TOP I WONDER WHAT HE MADE OF IT PERHAPS HE WAS THANKFUL
AND AS THIS EFFECT IS MARVELLOUSLY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE DIALOGUES AND SOLILOQUIES THEMSELVES SO IT IS FINALLY CONSUMMATED BY THE EXPEDIENT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IT IS TO THIS THAT I NOW SOLICIT THE READER'S ATTENTION
DOLOKHOV WAS OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WITH CURLY HAIR AND LIGHT BLUE EYES HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE LIKE ALL INFANTRY OFFICERS HE WORE NO MUSTACHE SO THAT HIS MOUTH THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE OF HIS FACE WAS CLEARLY SEEN
FIRST RATE SAID PIERRE LOOKING AT DOLOKHOV WHO WITH A BOTTLE OF RUM IN HIS HAND WAS APPROACHING THE WINDOW FROM WHICH THE LIGHT OF THE SKY THE DAWN MERGING WITH THE AFTERGLOW OF SUNSET WAS VISIBLE DOLOKHOV THE BOTTLE OF RUM STILL IN HIS HAND
TO PUT AN END TO WHAT SEEMS TO HIM A RETROGRADE STEP IN CIVILISATION IT ALSO APPEARS SO TO ME BUT I AM NOT AWARE THAT ANY COMMUNITY HAS A RIGHT TO FORCE ANOTHER TO BE CIVILISED
HE MAY BE TO US AN OBJECT OF PITY PERHAPS OF DISLIKE BUT NOT OF ANGER OR RESENTMENT WE SHALL NOT TREAT HIM LIKE AN ENEMY OF SOCIETY THE WORST WE SHALL THINK OURSELVES JUSTIFIED IN DOING IS LEAVING HIM TO HIMSELF
TO BE FIXED ON SOME EQUITABLE PRINCIPLE OF THE LABOURS AND SACRIFICES INCURRED FOR DEFENDING THE SOCIETY OR ITS MEMBERS FROM INJURY AND MOLESTATION THESE CONDITIONS SOCIETY IS JUSTIFIED IN ENFORCING AT ALL COSTS TO THOSE WHO ENDEAVOUR TO WITHHOLD FULFILMENT
TO SEND AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THEM AND COMPEL THEM BY FORCE TO CONFORM TO THE OPINIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE THE ARTICLE OF THE MORMONITE DOCTRINE WHICH IS THE CHIEF PROVOCATIVE TO THE ANTIPATHY WHICH THUS BREAKS THROUGH THE ORDINARY RESTRAINTS OF RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE IS ITS SANCTION OF POLYGAMY
AND THE REPROBATION WHICH IS DUE TO HIM FOR AN OFFENCE AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS IS NOT A MERELY NOMINAL DISTINCTION IT MAKES A VAST DIFFERENCE BOTH IN OUR FEELINGS AND IN OUR CONDUCT TOWARDS HIM
FOR PROHIBITION OF THEIR SALE IS IN FACT AS IT IS INTENDED TO BE PROHIBITION OF THEIR USE AND THOUGH THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF EXECUTING THE LAW HAS CAUSED ITS REPEAL IN SEVERAL OF THE STATES WHICH HAD ADOPTED IT
EFFECTUAL SUMPTUARY LAW AND THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNION IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR A PERSON POSSESSING A VERY LARGE INCOME TO FIND ANY MODE OF SPENDING IT WHICH WILL NOT INCUR POPULAR DISAPPROBATION
AND IT EASILY COMES TO BE CONSIDERED A MARK OF SPIRIT AND COURAGE TO FLY IN THE FACE OF SUCH USURPED AUTHORITY AND DO WITH OSTENTATION THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT ENJOINS AS IN THE FASHION OF GROSSNESS WHICH SUCCEEDED IN THE TIME OF CHARLES TWO
COMBINED WITH THE NOTION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO A VETO ON THE MANNER IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS SHALL SPEND THEIR INCOMES WE HAVE ONLY FURTHER TO SUPPOSE A CONSIDERABLE DIFFUSION OF SOCIALIST OPINIONS
DIIS CURAE IT REMAINS TO BE PROVED THAT SOCIETY OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS HOLDS A COMMISSION FROM ON HIGH TO AVENGE ANY SUPPOSED OFFENCE TO OMNIPOTENCE WHICH IS NOT ALSO A WRONG TO OUR FELLOW CREATURES
AND USUALLY DIMINISHES BY A GREATER OR LESS AMOUNT THE GENERAL RESOURCES OF THE COMMUNITY IF HE DETERIORATES HIS BODILY OR MENTAL FACULTIES HE NOT ONLY BRINGS EVIL UPON ALL WHO DEPENDED ON HIM FOR ANY PORTION OF THEIR HAPPINESS
MERELY FROM WITHOUT IN THIS DEPARTMENT THEREFORE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS INDIVIDUALITY HAS ITS PROPER FIELD OF ACTION IN THE CONDUCT OF HUMAN BEINGS TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER IT IS NECESSARY THAT GENERAL RULES SHOULD FOR THE MOST PART BE OBSERVED
BUT NEITHER ONE PERSON NOR ANY NUMBER OF PERSONS IS WARRANTED IN SAYING TO ANOTHER HUMAN CREATURE OF RIPE YEARS THAT HE SHALL NOT DO WITH HIS LIFE FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT WHAT HE CHOOSES TO DO WITH IT HE IS THE PERSON MOST INTERESTED IN HIS OWN WELL BEING
BUT THE ENORMITY OF ACTING OR FEELING DIFFERENTLY FROM ITSELF AND THIS STANDARD OF JUDGMENT THINLY DISGUISED IS HELD UP TO MANKIND AS THE DICTATE OF RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY BY NINE TENTHS OF ALL MORALISTS AND SPECULATIVE WRITERS
WHEN ONCE IT THOROUGHLY SINKS INTO THE FEELINGS SEEMS ALWAYS TO EXCITE EVEN IN THOSE WHOSE PERSONAL HABITS ARE ANYTHING BUT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEANLY AND OF WHICH THE SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS IMPURITY SO INTENSE IN THE HINDOOS IS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE
WE HAVE A RIGHT ALSO IN VARIOUS WAYS TO ACT UPON OUR UNFAVOURABLE OPINION OF ANY ONE NOT TO THE OPPRESSION OF HIS INDIVIDUALITY BUT IN THE EXERCISE OF OURS
THAT IS OF AN OVERRULING MAJORITY THOUGH OFTEN WRONG IS LIKELY TO BE STILL OFTENER RIGHT BECAUSE ON SUCH QUESTIONS THEY ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO JUDGE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH SOME MODE OF CONDUCT IF ALLOWED TO BE PRACTISED WOULD AFFECT THEMSELVES
AND SINCE THIS JUDGMENT AND FEELING ARE A FACT WHICH HE WOULD PREFER TO AVOID IT IS DOING HIM A SERVICE TO WARN HIM OF IT BEFOREHAND AS OF ANY OTHER DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HE EXPOSES HIMSELF
THESE ARE MORAL VICES AND CONSTITUTE A BAD AND ODIOUS MORAL CHARACTER UNLIKE THE SELF REGARDING FAULTS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WHICH ARE NOT PROPERLY IMMORALITIES AND TO WHATEVER PITCH THEY MAY BE CARRIED DO NOT CONSTITUTE WICKEDNESS
THE MORAL CULPABILITY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME GEORGE BARNWELL MURDERED HIS UNCLE TO GET MONEY FOR HIS MISTRESS BUT IF HE HAD DONE IT TO SET HIMSELF UP IN BUSINESS HE WOULD EQUALLY HAVE BEEN HANGED
DISSIMULATION AND INSINCERITY IRASCIBILITY ON INSUFFICIENT CAUSE AND RESENTMENT DISPROPORTIONED TO THE PROVOCATION THE LOVE OF DOMINEERING OVER OTHERS THE DESIRE TO ENGROSS MORE THAN ONE'S SHARE OF ADVANTAGES
BUT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR ENTERTAINING ANY SUCH QUESTION WHEN A PERSON'S CONDUCT AFFECTS THE INTERESTS OF NO PERSONS BESIDES HIMSELF OR NEEDS NOT AFFECT THEM UNLESS THEY LIKE
THERE ARE FEW ACTS WHICH CHRISTIANS AND EUROPEANS REGARD WITH MORE UNAFFECTED DISGUST THAN MUSSULMANS REGARD THIS PARTICULAR MODE OF SATISFYING HUNGER IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE AN OFFENCE AGAINST THEIR RELIGION
SOME PEOPLE'S OPINION OF WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHILE VERY OFTEN IT DOES NOT EVEN MEAN THAT THE PUBLIC WITH THE MOST PERFECT INDIFFERENCE PASSING OVER THE PLEASURE OR CONVENIENCE OF THOSE WHOSE CONDUCT THEY CENSURE AND CONSIDERING ONLY THEIR OWN PREFERENCE
TO THE FANATICAL MORAL INTOLERANCE OF THE PURITANS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT IS SAID OF THE NECESSITY OF PROTECTING SOCIETY FROM THE BAD EXAMPLE SET TO OTHERS BY THE VICIOUS OR THE SELF INDULGENT IT IS TRUE THAT BAD EXAMPLE MAY HAVE A PERNICIOUS EFFECT
FLYING FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY BEFORE THE CALIPHS ARRIVED IN WESTERN INDIA THEY WERE ADMITTED TO TOLERATION BY THE HINDOO SOVEREIGNS ON CONDITION OF NOT EATING BEEF
AND HAS BEEN MADE THE FOUNDATION OF A SOCIETY IN THE AGE OF NEWSPAPERS RAILWAYS AND THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH WHAT HERE CONCERNS US IS
BY DERIVING A PROFIT FROM THE CREATION OF A MISERY I AM TAXED TO SUPPORT IT IMPEDES MY RIGHT TO FREE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT BY SURROUNDING MY PATH WITH DANGERS AND BY WEAKENING AND DEMORALISING SOCIETY
IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIVERSAL OF ALL HUMAN PROPENSITIES AS A FIRST INSTANCE CONSIDER THE ANTIPATHIES WHICH MEN CHERISH ON NO BETTER GROUNDS THAN THAT PERSONS WHOSE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THEIRS DO NOT PRACTISE THEIR RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
BUT THE OPINION OF A SIMILAR MAJORITY IMPOSED AS A LAW ON THE MINORITY ON QUESTIONS OF SELF REGARDING CONDUCT IS QUITE AS LIKELY TO BE WRONG AS RIGHT FOR IN THESE CASES PUBLIC OPINION MEANS AT THE BEST
AND OPINIONS PROPOSED WHICH ASSERT AN UNLIMITED RIGHT IN THE PUBLIC NOT ONLY TO PROHIBIT BY LAW EVERYTHING WHICH IT THINKS WRONG BUT IN ORDER TO GET AT WHAT IT THINKS WRONG TO PROHIBIT ANY NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH IT ADMITS TO BE INNOCENT
I CLAIM AS A CITIZEN A RIGHT TO LEGISLATE WHENEVER MY SOCIAL RIGHTS ARE INVADED BY THE SOCIAL ACT OF ANOTHER
GROSS DISGUSTING WHAT DO PROTESTANTS THINK OF THESE PERFECTLY SINCERE FEELINGS AND OF THE ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THEM AGAINST NON CATHOLICS
OBLIGATORY ON ALL THE WORLD THE EVIL HERE POINTED OUT IS NOT ONE WHICH EXISTS ONLY IN THEORY AND IT MAY PERHAPS BE EXPECTED THAT I SHOULD SPECIFY THE INSTANCES IN WHICH THE PUBLIC OF THIS AGE AND COUNTRY IMPROPERLY INVESTS ITS OWN PREFERENCES
THAT THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH ARE STRICTLY INSEPARABLE FROM THE UNFAVOURABLE JUDGMENT OF OTHERS ARE THE ONLY ONES TO WHICH A PERSON SHOULD EVER BE SUBJECTED FOR THAT PORTION OF HIS CONDUCT AND CHARACTER WHICH CONCERNS HIS OWN GOOD
SHOULD EVER SUCCEED IN REGAINING ITS LOST GROUND AS RELIGIONS SUPPOSED TO BE DECLINING HAVE SO OFTEN BEEN KNOWN TO DO TO IMAGINE ANOTHER CONTINGENCY PERHAPS MORE LIKELY TO BE REALISED THAN THE ONE LAST MENTIONED
WHO ARE EQUALLY INCAPABLE OF SELF GOVERNMENT IF GAMBLING OR DRUNKENNESS OR INCONTINENCE OR IDLENESS OR UNCLEANLINESS ARE AS INJURIOUS TO HAPPINESS AND AS GREAT A HINDRANCE TO IMPROVEMENT AS MANY OR MOST OF THE ACTS PROHIBITED BY LAW
IF PROTECTION AGAINST THEMSELVES IS CONFESSEDLY DUE TO CHILDREN AND PERSONS UNDER AGE
AS DRAWN FROM CONTINGENCIES IMPOSSIBLE AMONG US OPINION IN THIS COUNTRY NOT BEING LIKELY TO ENFORCE ABSTINENCE FROM MEATS OR TO INTERFERE WITH PEOPLE FOR WORSHIPPING AND FOR EITHER MARRYING OR NOT MARRYING ACCORDING TO THEIR CREED OR INCLINATION
BUT ON THAT OF THE BUYER AND CONSUMER SINCE THE STATE MIGHT JUST AS WELL FORBID HIM TO DRINK WINE AS PURPOSELY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OBTAIN IT THE SECRETARY HOWEVER SAYS
OR JUSTIFIED BY ALLOWABLE SELF PREFERENCE IS A SUBJECT OF MORAL DISAPPROBATION FOR THAT FAILURE BUT NOT FOR THE CAUSE OF IT NOR FOR THE ERRORS MERELY PERSONAL TO HIMSELF WHICH MAY HAVE REMOTELY LED TO IT
OR OTHER PREPONDERATING POWER IN THE COUNTRY AND ALL PERSONS MUST BE READY TO CONFORM TO THE IDEA OF A CHRISTIAN COMMONWEALTH AS UNDERSTOOD BY THE EARLY SETTLERS IN NEW ENGLAND IF A RELIGIOUS PROFESSION SIMILAR TO THEIRS
THE OPERATIVES ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT IN THINKING THAT IF ALL WORKED ON SUNDAY SEVEN DAYS WORK WOULD HAVE TO BE GIVEN FOR SIX DAYS WAGES BUT SO LONG AS THE GREAT MASS OF EMPLOYMENTS ARE SUSPENDED
AND HOWEVER SURPRISING THIS FACT MAY APPEAR IT HAS ITS EXPLANATION IN THE COMMON IDEAS AND CUSTOMS OF THE WORLD WHICH TEACHING WOMEN TO THINK MARRIAGE THE ONE THING NEEDFUL MAKE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT MANY A WOMAN SHOULD PREFER BEING ONE OF SEVERAL WIVES
IN SOME OF HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCES UNHAPPILY ARE AMONG THOSE WHO FIGURE IN POLITICAL LIFE THE ORGAN OF THE ALLIANCE WHO WOULD DEEPLY DEPLORE THE RECOGNITION OF ANY PRINCIPLE WHICH COULD BE WRESTED TO JUSTIFY BIGOTRY AND PERSECUTION
THIS IS NEITHER POSSIBLE NOR DESIRABLE IF HE IS EMINENT IN ANY OF THE QUALITIES WHICH CONDUCE TO HIS OWN GOOD HE IS SO FAR A PROPER OBJECT OF ADMIRATION HE IS SO MUCH THE NEARER TO THE IDEAL PERFECTION OF HUMAN NATURE
WHICH ARE NOT SOCIAL BUT INDIVIDUAL ALTHOUGH IT IS TO THIS CLASS SURELY THAT THE ACT OF DRINKING FERMENTED LIQUORS BELONGS SELLING FERMENTED LIQUORS HOWEVER IS TRADING AND TRADING IS A SOCIAL ACT BUT THE INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINED OF
BUT WHERE HAS THERE BEEN SEEN A PUBLIC WHICH SET ANY SUCH LIMIT TO ITS CENSORSHIP OR WHEN DOES THE PUBLIC TROUBLE ITSELF ABOUT UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE IN ITS INTERFERENCES WITH PERSONAL CONDUCT IT IS SELDOM THINKING OF ANYTHING
WHO HAVE NO PART OR CONCERN IN IT LET THEM SEND MISSIONARIES IF THEY PLEASE TO PREACH AGAINST IT AND LET THEM BY ANY FAIR MEANS OF WHICH SILENCING THE TEACHERS IS NOT ONE OPPOSE THE PROGRESS OF SIMILAR DOCTRINES AMONG THEIR OWN PEOPLE
NOT SIMPLY THREATENED BUT LONG SINCE CARRIED INTO TRIUMPHANT EFFECT
THE PEOPLE OF ONE ENGLISH COLONY AND OF NEARLY HALF THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN INTERDICTED BY LAW FROM MAKING ANY USE WHATEVER OF FERMENTED DRINKS
AND THAT NO ONE OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED THROUGH PIECEWORK OR OTHERWISE TO EARN BY SUPERIOR SKILL OR INDUSTRY MORE THAN OTHERS CAN WITHOUT IT AND THEY EMPLOY A MORAL POLICE WHICH OCCASIONALLY BECOMES A PHYSICAL ONE TO DETER SKILFUL WORKMEN FROM RECEIVING
THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTS DO NOT THEN FALL ON HIMSELF BUT ON OTHERS AND SOCIETY AS THE PROTECTOR OF ALL ITS MEMBERS MUST RETALIATE ON HIM MUST INFLICT PAIN ON HIM FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF PUNISHMENT
THERE ARE STILL IN THIS COUNTRY LARGE BODIES OF PERSONS BY WHOSE NOTIONS OF MORALITY AND RELIGION THESE RECREATIONS ARE CONDEMNED AND THOSE PERSONS BELONGING CHIEFLY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS
THE SMALL NUMBER WHO FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS MUST STILL WORK OBTAIN A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE OF EARNINGS AND THEY ARE NOT OBLIGED TO FOLLOW THOSE OCCUPATIONS IF THEY PREFER LEISURE TO EMOLUMENT IF A FURTHER REMEDY IS SOUGHT
TO INDIVIDUALITY SHOULD BELONG THE PART OF LIFE IN WHICH IT IS CHIEFLY THE INDIVIDUAL THAT IS INTERESTED TO SOCIETY THE PART WHICH CHIEFLY INTERESTS SOCIETY THOUGH SOCIETY IS NOT FOUNDED ON A CONTRACT
WE HAVE A RIGHT AND IT MAY BE OUR DUTY TO CAUTION OTHERS AGAINST HIM IF WE THINK HIS EXAMPLE OR CONVERSATION LIKELY TO HAVE A PERNICIOUS EFFECT ON THOSE WITH WHOM HE ASSOCIATES
NO MORE THAN BETWEEN THE DESIRE OF A THIEF TO TAKE A PURSE AND THE DESIRE OF THE RIGHT OWNER TO KEEP IT AND A PERSON'S TASTE IS AS MUCH HIS OWN PECULIAR CONCERN AS HIS OPINION OR HIS PURSE
AND PROFESS TO BE A KIND OF CHRISTIANS NO ONE HAS A DEEPER DISAPPROBATION THAN I HAVE OF THIS MORMON INSTITUTION
BY SUSPENDING THE GREATER OPERATIONS OF INDUSTRY ON A PARTICULAR DAY BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION GROUNDED ON THE DIRECT INTEREST WHICH OTHERS HAVE IN EACH INDIVIDUAL'S OBSERVANCE OF THE PRACTICE
TO AGITATE FOR A SIMILAR LAW IN THIS COUNTRY THE ASSOCIATION OR ALLIANCE AS IT TERMS ITSELF WHICH HAS BEEN FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS ACQUIRED SOME NOTORIETY
THOUGH NOT REQUIRED BY THEIR RELIGION
NOR OCCASIONS PERCEPTIBLE HURT TO ANY ASSIGNABLE INDIVIDUAL EXCEPT HIMSELF THE INCONVENIENCE IS ONE WHICH SOCIETY CAN AFFORD TO BEAR FOR THE SAKE OF THE GREATER GOOD OF HUMAN FREEDOM IF GROWN PERSONS ARE TO BE PUNISHED FOR NOT TAKING PROPER CARE OF THEMSELVES
IF THIS BE SO THE SOONER SUCH A CIVILISATION RECEIVES NOTICE TO QUIT THE BETTER IT CAN ONLY GO ON FROM BAD TO WORSE UNTIL DESTROYED AND REGENERATED LIKE THE WESTERN EMPIRE BY ENERGETIC BARBARIANS
WHICH HAS BEEN FATAL TO THEIR PREDECESSORS I FULLY ADMIT THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH A PERSON DOES TO HIMSELF MAY SERIOUSLY AFFECT BOTH THROUGH THEIR SYMPATHIES AND THEIR INTERESTS THOSE NEARLY CONNECTED WITH HIM
AND ITS BEST EFFORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN INDIVIDUAL CASES ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL ONES BUT IT IS PERFECTLY WELL ABLE TO MAKE THE RISING GENERATION AS A WHOLE AS GOOD AS AND A LITTLE BETTER THAN ITSELF
THERE MUST BE SOME LENGTH OF TIME AND AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE AFTER WHICH A MORAL OR PRUDENTIAL TRUTH MAY BE REGARDED AS ESTABLISHED AND IT IS MERELY DESIRED TO PREVENT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION FROM FALLING OVER THE SAME PRECIPICE
IT IS A DIRECT INFRACTION OF THAT PRINCIPLE BEING A MERE RIVETING OF THE CHAINS OF ONE HALF OF THE COMMUNITY AND AN EMANCIPATION OF THE OTHER FROM RECIPROCITY OF OBLIGATION TOWARDS THEM
BUT WITHOUT DWELLING UPON SUPPOSITITIOUS CASES THERE ARE IN OUR OWN DAY GROSS USURPATIONS UPON THE LIBERTY OF PRIVATE LIFE ACTUALLY PRACTISED AND STILL GREATER ONES THREATENED WITH SOME EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS
VESTED IN THE STATE ITSELF AND NOT IN THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE WITHIN IT NO MENTION IS MADE OF A THIRD CLASS DIFFERENT FROM EITHER OF THESE
AND I DO NOT SEE HOW THOSE WHO BELIEVE THIS CAN THINK OTHERWISE THAN THAT THE EXAMPLE ON THE WHOLE MUST BE MORE SALUTARY THAN HURTFUL SINCE IF IT DISPLAYS THE MISCONDUCT
HOW MUCH OF HUMAN LIFE SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALITY AND HOW MUCH TO SOCIETY EACH WILL RECEIVE ITS PROPER SHARE IF EACH HAS THAT WHICH MORE PARTICULARLY CONCERNS IT
A RECENT WRITER IN SOME RESPECTS OF CONSIDERABLE MERIT PROPOSES TO USE HIS OWN WORDS NOT A CRUSADE BUT A CIVILIZADE AGAINST THIS POLYGAMOUS COMMUNITY
AS SOON AS ANY PART OF A PERSON'S CONDUCT AFFECTS PREJUDICIALLY THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS SOCIETY HAS JURISDICTION OVER IT AND THE QUESTION WHETHER THE GENERAL WELFARE WILL OR WILL NOT BE PROMOTED BY INTERFERING WITH IT BECOMES OPEN TO DISCUSSION
A THEORY OF SOCIAL RIGHTS THE LIKE OF WHICH PROBABLY NEVER BEFORE FOUND ITS WAY INTO DISTINCT LANGUAGE BEING NOTHING SHORT OF THIS THAT IT IS THE ABSOLUTE SOCIAL RIGHT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL
AND EVEN IF RIGHT ARE AS LIKELY AS NOT TO BE MISAPPLIED TO INDIVIDUAL CASES
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PURPOSELY INFLICTED ON HIM FOR THE SAKE OF PUNISHMENT A PERSON WHO SHOWS RASHNESS OBSTINACY SELF CONCEIT WHO CANNOT LIVE WITHIN MODERATE MEANS WHO CANNOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM HURTFUL INDULGENCES
THE NOTION THAT IT IS ONE MAN'S DUTY THAT ANOTHER SHOULD BE RELIGIOUS
BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE BY NO MEANS EXPLAINS EITHER THE DEGREE OR THE KIND OF THEIR REPUGNANCE FOR WINE ALSO IS FORBIDDEN BY THEIR RELIGION AND TO PARTAKE OF IT IS BY ALL MUSSULMANS ACCOUNTED WRONG BUT NOT DISGUSTING
A CIVILISATION THAT CAN THUS SUCCUMB TO ITS VANQUISHED ENEMY MUST FIRST HAVE BECOME SO DEGENERATE THAT NEITHER ITS APPOINTED PRIESTS AND TEACHERS NOR ANYBODY ELSE HAS THE CAPACITY OR WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO STAND UP FOR IT
WE ARE NOT BOUND FOR EXAMPLE TO SEEK HIS SOCIETY WE HAVE A RIGHT TO AVOID IT THOUGH NOT TO PARADE THE AVOIDANCE FOR WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE SOCIETY MOST ACCEPTABLE TO US
IT IS EASY FOR ANY ONE TO IMAGINE AN IDEAL PUBLIC WHICH LEAVES THE FREEDOM AND CHOICE OF INDIVIDUALS IN ALL UNCERTAIN MATTERS UNDISTURBED AND ONLY REQUIRES THEM TO ABSTAIN FROM MODES OF CONDUCT WHICH UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE HAS CONDEMNED
CHAPTER FOUR OF THE LIMITS TO THE AUTHORITY OF SOCIETY OVER THE INDIVIDUAL WHAT THEN IS THE RIGHTFUL LIMIT TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL OVER HIMSELF
I AM NOT WRITING AN ESSAY ON THE ABERRATIONS OF EXISTING MORAL FEELING THAT IS TOO WEIGHTY A SUBJECT TO BE DISCUSSED PARENTHETICALLY
IF ANYTHING INVADES MY SOCIAL RIGHTS CERTAINLY THE TRAFFIC IN STRONG DRINK DOES IT DESTROYS MY PRIMARY RIGHT OF SECURITY BY CONSTANTLY CREATING AND STIMULATING SOCIAL DISORDER IT INVADES MY RIGHT OF EQUALITY
EXCEPT PERHAPS TO THAT OF HOLDING OPINIONS IN SECRET WITHOUT EVER DISCLOSING THEM FOR
WE MUST BEWARE OF ADMITTING A PRINCIPLE OF WHICH WE SHOULD RESENT AS A GROSS INJUSTICE THE APPLICATION TO OURSELVES THE PRECEDING INSTANCES MAY BE OBJECTED TO ALTHOUGH UNREASONABLY
HARDLY ANY OFFENCE THAT IS COMMITTED WOULD DETRACT MORE FROM THE GENERAL SUM OF GOOD FINALLY IF BY HIS VICES OR FOLLIES A PERSON DOES NO DIRECT HARM TO OTHERS HE IS NEVERTHELESS IT MAY BE SAID INJURIOUS BY HIS EXAMPLE
AND EVEN IT WILL BE ADDED IF THE CONSEQUENCES OF MISCONDUCT COULD BE CONFINED TO THE VICIOUS OR THOUGHTLESS INDIVIDUAL OUGHT SOCIETY TO ABANDON TO THEIR OWN GUIDANCE THOSE WHO ARE MANIFESTLY UNFIT FOR IT
WHICH SOCIETY DOES NOT PRETEND IT HAS A RIGHT TO EXACT BUT I CANNOT CONSENT TO ARGUE THE POINT AS IF SOCIETY HAD NO MEANS OF BRINGING ITS WEAKER MEMBERS UP TO ITS ORDINARY STANDARD OF RATIONAL CONDUCT EXCEPT WAITING TILL THEY DO SOMETHING IRRATIONAL
THE NEXT EXAMPLE HOWEVER SHALL BE TAKEN FROM AN INTERFERENCE WITH LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE BY NO MEANS PASSED ALL DANGER OF WHEREVER THE PURITANS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL AS IN NEW ENGLAND AND IN GREAT BRITAIN AT THE TIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH
THOUGH THE PHRASE IS NOT UNOBJECTIONABLE LOWNESS OR DEPRAVATION OF TASTE
IN ORDER THAT PEOPLE MAY KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO EXPECT BUT IN EACH PERSON'S OWN CONCERNS HIS INDIVIDUAL SPONTANEITY IS ENTITLED TO FREE EXERCISE CONSIDERATIONS TO AID HIS JUDGMENT EXHORTATIONS TO STRENGTHEN HIS WILL MAY BE OFFERED TO HIM
THERE ARE MANY WHO CONSIDER AS AN INJURY TO THEMSELVES ANY CONDUCT WHICH THEY HAVE A DISTASTE FOR AND RESENT IT AS AN OUTRAGE TO THEIR FEELINGS AS A RELIGIOUS BIGOT WHEN CHARGED WITH DISREGARDING THE RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF OTHERS
IF WE DO NOT INTERFERE BENEVOLENTLY BY SHOWING INTEREST OR CONCERN FOR HIM IT IS FAR OTHERWISE IF HE HAS INFRINGED THE RULES NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY
WHEN THE PERIOD OF EDUCATION IS PAST THE SELF REGARDING VIRTUES SHOULD BE INCULCATED HUMAN BEINGS OWE TO EACH OTHER HELP TO DISTINGUISH THE BETTER FROM THE WORSE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO CHOOSE THE FORMER AND AVOID THE LATTER
THEY SHOULD BE FOR EVER STIMULATING EACH OTHER TO INCREASED EXERCISE OF THEIR HIGHER FACULTIES AND INCREASED DIRECTION OF THEIR FEELINGS AND AIMS TOWARDS WISE INSTEAD OF FOOLISH ELEVATING INSTEAD OF DEGRADING OBJECTS AND CONTEMPLATIONS
BUT WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH HIM ACTS INJURIOUS TO OTHERS REQUIRE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TREATMENT ENCROACHMENT ON THEIR RIGHTS
AND MUST TAKE CARE THAT IT BE SUFFICIENTLY SEVERE IN THE ONE CASE HE IS AN OFFENDER AT OUR BAR
WHO ARE THE ASCENDANT POWER IN THE PRESENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITION OF THE KINGDOM IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE THAT PERSONS OF THESE SENTIMENTS MAY AT SOME TIME OR OTHER COMMAND A MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT HOW WILL THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY
IT HAS HAD THE WHOLE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD
THAT THIS RELIGION LIKE OTHER AND BETTER RELIGIONS HAS ITS MARTYRS THAT ITS PROPHET AND FOUNDER WAS FOR HIS TEACHING PUT TO DEATH BY A MOB THAT OTHERS OF ITS ADHERENTS LOST THEIR LIVES BY THE SAME LAWLESS VIOLENCE
NOR IS THERE ANYTHING WHICH TENDS MORE TO DISCREDIT AND FRUSTRATE THE BETTER MEANS OF INFLUENCING CONDUCT THAN A RESORT TO THE WORSE IF THERE BE AMONG THOSE WHOM IT IS ATTEMPTED TO COERCE INTO PRUDENCE OR TEMPERANCE ANY OF THE MATERIAL
WHY IT MAY BE ASKED SHOULD NOT LAW SO FAR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH PRACTICABILITY AND SOCIAL CONVENIENCE ENDEAVOUR TO REPRESS THESE ALSO AND AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE UNAVOIDABLE IMPERFECTIONS OF LAW
BUT WHEN THE DISSENTIENTS HAVE CONCEDED TO THE HOSTILE SENTIMENTS OF OTHERS FAR MORE THAN COULD JUSTLY BE DEMANDED WHEN THEY HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRIES TO WHICH THEIR DOCTRINES WERE UNACCEPTABLE AND ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN A REMOTE CORNER OF THE EARTH
EVERY ONE WHO RECEIVES THE PROTECTION OF SOCIETY OWES A RETURN FOR THE BENEFIT AND THE FACT OF LIVING IN SOCIETY RENDERS IT INDISPENSABLE THAT EACH SHOULD BE BOUND TO OBSERVE A CERTAIN LINE OF CONDUCT TOWARDS THE REST THIS CONDUCT CONSISTS FIRST
UNDERTAKES TO POINT OUT THE BROAD AND IMPASSABLE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDES SUCH PRINCIPLES FROM THOSE OF THE ASSOCIATION ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THOUGHT OPINION CONSCIENCE APPEAR TO ME HE SAYS TO BE WITHOUT THE SPHERE OF LEGISLATION
AND IF ADMITTED WOULD FULLY JUSTIFY THEM
IT MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE ESTABLISHMENT BY CUSTOM OF A HOLIDAY ON SOME OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK FOR THOSE PARTICULAR CLASSES OF PERSONS THE ONLY GROUND THEREFORE ON WHICH RESTRICTIONS ON SUNDAY AMUSEMENTS CAN BE DEFENDED MUST BE THAT THEY ARE RELIGIOUSLY WRONG
BINDING ON OURSELVES AND ON ALL OTHERS WHAT CAN THE POOR PUBLIC DO BUT APPLY THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND MAKE THEIR OWN PERSONAL FEELINGS OF GOOD AND EVIL IF THEY ARE TOLERABLY
HOW IT MAY BE ASKED CAN ANY PART OF THE CONDUCT OF A MEMBER OF SOCIETY BE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO THE OTHER MEMBERS
THAT EVERY OTHER INDIVIDUAL SHALL ACT IN EVERY RESPECT EXACTLY AS HE OUGHT THAT WHOSOEVER FAILS THEREOF IN THE SMALLEST PARTICULAR VIOLATES MY SOCIAL RIGHT AND ENTITLES ME TO DEMAND FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE REMOVAL OF THE GRIEVANCE
OR WHO CAN BLAME PEOPLE FOR DESIRING TO SUPPRESS WHAT THEY REGARD AS A SCANDAL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND MAN NO STRONGER CASE CAN BE SHOWN FOR PROHIBITING ANYTHING WHICH IS REGARDED AS A PERSONAL IMMORALITY
WITHOUT DOUBT ABSTINENCE ON ONE DAY IN THE WEEK SO FAR AS THE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE PERMIT FROM THE USUAL DAILY OCCUPATION THOUGH IN NO RESPECT RELIGIOUSLY BINDING ON ANY EXCEPT JEWS IS A HIGHLY BENEFICIAL CUSTOM
THEIR AVERSION TO THE FLESH OF THE UNCLEAN BEAST IS ON THE CONTRARY OF THAT PECULIAR CHARACTER RESEMBLING AN INSTINCTIVE ANTIPATHY WHICH THE IDEA OF UNCLEANNESS
THAT THEY WERE FORCIBLY EXPELLED IN A BODY FROM THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FIRST GREW UP WHILE NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CHASED INTO A SOLITARY RECESS IN THE MIDST OF A DESERT MANY IN THIS COUNTRY OPENLY DECLARE THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT ONLY THAT IT IS NOT CONVENIENT
WHETHER HE DISPLEASES US IN THINGS IN WHICH WE THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL HIM OR IN THINGS IN WHICH WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE NOT IF HE DISPLEASES US WE MAY EXPRESS OUR DISTASTE AND WE MAY STAND ALOOF FROM A PERSON AS WELL AS FROM A THING THAT DISPLEASES US
MY MIND TO THE LOVE AND NOURISHMENT OF TRUTH AND TO A DISTASTE FOR ALL SUCH REASONINGS AS WERE UNSOUND BUT I HAD NO INTENTION ON THAT ACCOUNT OF ATTEMPTING TO MASTER ALL
EMPLOYED MUCH OF MY TIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE WORK AS WELL BY ERADICATING FROM MY MIND ALL THE ERRONEOUS OPINIONS I HAD UP TO THAT MOMENT ACCEPTED AS BY AMASSING VARIETY OF EXPERIENCE TO AFFORD MATERIALS FOR MY REASONINGS
AND THE CHILD IT IS ENOUGH MY HUSBAND SAID MADAME DEFARGE I HAVE SEEN THEM WE MAY GO BUT THE SUPPRESSED MANNER HAD ENOUGH OF MENACE IN IT
THE LONG CHAINS OF SIMPLE AND EASY REASONINGS BY MEANS OF WHICH GEOMETERS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REACH THE CONCLUSIONS OF THEIR MOST DIFFICULT DEMONSTRATIONS
CAREFULLY TO SATISFY MYSELF OF THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE TASK I WAS SETTING MYSELF AND ASCERTAIN THE TRUE METHOD BY WHICH TO ARRIVE AT THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHATEVER LAY WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY POWERS
AND THEY WENT DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD THERE THEY FOUND TWO WOMEN ONE KNITTING
HAD LED ME TO IMAGINE THAT ALL THINGS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH MAN IS COMPETENT ARE MUTUALLY CONNECTED IN THE SAME WAY AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING SO FAR REMOVED FROM US AS TO BE BEYOND OUR REACH OR SO HIDDEN
AT LITTLE LUCIE AS IF IT WERE THE FINGER OF FATE YES MADAME ANSWERED MISTER LORRY THIS IS OUR POOR PRISONER'S DARLING DAUGHTER AND ONLY CHILD
THAT BY ITS USE MY MIND WAS BECOMING GRADUALLY HABITUATED TO CLEARER AND MORE DISTINCT CONCEPTIONS OF ITS OBJECTS AND I HOPED ALSO FROM NOT HAVING RESTRICTED THIS METHOD TO ANY PARTICULAR MATTER TO APPLY IT TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE OTHER SCIENCES
REPUDIATED HIM HE LIVED IN THE MOST VIOLENT QUARTER AND DOUBTLESS WAS INFLUENTIAL THERE AND DEEP IN ITS DANGEROUS WORKINGS NOON COMING AND THE DOCTOR NOT RETURNING
WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF MEN OF THIS CLASS ONCE TAKE THE LIBERTY TO DOUBT OF THEIR ACCUSTOMED OPINIONS AND QUIT THE BEATEN HIGHWAY THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO THREAD THE BYWAY THAT WOULD LEAD THEM BY A SHORTER COURSE
TO THE VENGEANCE WHOM HER EYES FIRST ENCOUNTERED WELL I AM SURE BOLDFACE I HOPE
THE PARTICULAR SCIENCES COMMONLY DENOMINATED MATHEMATICS BUT OBSERVING THAT HOWEVER DIFFERENT THEIR OBJECTS THEY ALL AGREE IN CONSIDERING ONLY THE VARIOUS RELATIONS OR PROPORTIONS
OR WITH SAVAGES AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN DRESS ITSELF THE FASHION WHICH PLEASED US TEN YEARS AGO AND WHICH MAY AGAIN PERHAPS BE RECEIVED INTO FAVOR BEFORE TEN YEARS HAVE GONE APPEARS TO US AT THIS MOMENT EXTRAVAGANT
WITH DARK CURLING HAIR FROM FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY YEARS OF AGE FOR ANSWER HE REPEATED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EMPHASIS THE WORDS DO YOU KNOW ME I HAVE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE PERHAPS AT MY WINE SHOP
AND OVERTURNING IT IN ORDER TO SET IT UP AMENDED AND THE SAME I THOUGHT WAS TRUE OF ANY SIMILAR PROJECT FOR REFORMING THE BODY OF THE SCIENCES OR THE ORDER OF TEACHING THEM ESTABLISHED IN THE SCHOOLS
AS A FIGURE TO FILL A DOORWAY THAT WOULD BEAR CONSIDERABLE KNOCKING ON THE HEAD AND RETAINED TO HIS OWN OCCUPATIONS A DISTURBED AND DOLEFUL MIND HE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON THEM AND SLOWLY AND HEAVILY THE DAY LAGGED ON WITH HIM
BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS I WAS INDUCED TO SEEK SOME OTHER METHOD WHICH WOULD COMPRISE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE THREE AND BE EXEMPT FROM THEIR DEFECTS AND AS A MULTITUDE OF LAWS OFTEN ONLY HAMPERS JUSTICE
IS AN ENGLISH LADY AND KNOWS NO FRENCH THE LADY IN QUESTION WHOSE ROOTED CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR ANY FOREIGNER WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN BY DISTRESS AND DANGER APPEARED WITH FOLDED ARMS AND OBSERVED IN ENGLISH
MAY OFTEN EQUAL OR SURPASS IN BEAUTY THOSE OF THE LATTER YET WHEN ONE OBSERVES THEIR INDISCRIMINATE JUXTAPOSITION
ALL WELL WITH CHARLES AND HE WERE TO BE RELEASED HE COULD NOT HOPE TO LEAVE THE CITY MISTER LORRY WENT OUT IN QUEST OF SUCH A LODGING AND FOUND A SUITABLE ONE HIGH UP IN A REMOVED BY STREET
WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO SEE THAT PRIVATE BUILDINGS CONTRIBUTED TO PUBLIC ORNAMENT THE DIFFICULTY OF REACHING HIGH PERFECTION WITH BUT THE MATERIALS OF OTHERS TO OPERATE ON WILL BE READILY ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE SAME WAY
TO THE CONSIDERATION OF FIGURES THAT IT CAN EXERCISE THE UNDERSTANDING ONLY ON CONDITION OF GREATLY FATIGUING THE IMAGINATION AND IN THE LATTER THERE IS SO COMPLETE A SUBJECTION TO CERTAIN RULES AND FORMULAS
AND WAS BESIDES FORTUNATELY UNDISTURBED BY ANY CARES OR PASSIONS I REMAINED THE WHOLE DAY IN SECLUSION WITH FULL OPPORTUNITY TO OCCUPY MY ATTENTION WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS
THAT IN THE TWO OR THREE MONTHS I DEVOTED TO THEIR EXAMINATION NOT ONLY DID I REACH SOLUTIONS OF QUESTIONS I HAD FORMERLY DEEMED EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT BUT EVEN AS REGARDS QUESTIONS OF THE SOLUTION OF WHICH I CONTINUED IGNORANT
RESULTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I COMMENCED WITH THE SIMPLEST AND MOST GENERAL TRUTHS AND THAT THUS EACH TRUTH DISCOVERED WAS A RULE AVAILABLE IN THE DISCOVERY OF SUBSEQUENT ONES
THE SHADOW ATTENDANT ON MADAME DEFARGE AND HER PARTY SEEMED TO FALL SO THREATENING AND DARK ON THE CHILD THAT HER MOTHER INSTINCTIVELY KNEELED ON THE GROUND BESIDE HER AND HELD HER TO HER BREAST
MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN IT HAS OF LATE GONE WITH MANY POOR SOULS CHEER UP AND HAVE A THANKFUL HEART I AM NOT THANKLESS I HOPE
AND BY CONTINUALLY EXERCISING MYSELF IN MY CHOSEN METHOD
PERCEIVING FURTHER THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THESE RELATIONS I SHOULD SOMETIMES HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM ONE BY ONE AND SOMETIMES ONLY TO BEAR THEM IN MIND OR EMBRACE THEM IN THE AGGREGATE
IT WORE ITSELF OUT AND WORE HIM OUT WITH IT UNTIL THE BANK CLOSED HE WAS AGAIN ALONE IN HIS ROOM OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT CONSIDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT WHEN HE HEARD A FOOT UPON THE STAIR
TUT TUT SAID MISTER LORRY
TO THIS LODGING HE AT ONCE REMOVED LUCIE AND HER CHILD AND MISS PROSS GIVING THEM WHAT COMFORT HE COULD AND MUCH MORE THAN HE HAD HIMSELF HE LEFT JERRY WITH THEM
INCLUDES ALL THAT GIVES CERTITUDE TO THE RULES OF ARITHMETIC BUT THE CHIEF GROUND OF MY SATISFACTION WITH THUS METHOD
AND WILL LOSE THEMSELVES AND CONTINUE TO WANDER FOR LIFE IN THE SECOND PLACE OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED OF SUFFICIENT SENSE OR MODESTY TO DETERMINE THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO EXCEL THEM IN THE POWER OF DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN TRUTH AND ERROR
IN THIS INSTANCE IS WITHIN THE REACH OF HUMAN GENIUS NOW IN CONCLUSION THE METHOD WHICH TEACHES ADHERENCE TO THE TRUE ORDER AND AN EXACT ENUMERATION OF ALL THE CONDITIONS OF THE THING SOUGHT
MISERY OPPRESSION AND NEGLECT OF ALL KINDS WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING ELSE RETURNED THE VENGEANCE
TO MY MIND SO CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY AS TO EXCLUDE ALL GROUND OF DOUBT THE SECOND
PART TWO I WAS THEN IN GERMANY ATTRACTED THITHER BY THE WARS IN THAT COUNTRY WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN BROUGHT TO A TERMINATION AND AS I WAS RETURNING TO THE ARMY FROM THE CORONATION OF THE EMPEROR
CHARLES IS SAFE BUT I CANNOT SAFELY LEAVE THIS PLACE YET I HAVE OBTAINED THE FAVOUR THAT THE BEARER HAS A SHORT NOTE FROM CHARLES TO HIS WIFE
I SHOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BELONGED TO THE LATTER CLASS HAD I RECEIVED INSTRUCTION FROM BUT ONE MASTER OR HAD I NEVER KNOWN THE DIVERSITIES OF OPINION THAT FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL HAVE PREVAILED AMONG MEN OF THE GREATEST LEARNING
YES I COME FROM DOCTOR MANETTE AND WHAT SAYS HE WHAT DOES HE SEND ME
SO THAT A STATE IS BEST GOVERNED WHEN WITH FEW LAWS THESE ARE RIGIDLY ADMINISTERED IN LIKE MANNER INSTEAD OF THE GREAT NUMBER OF PRECEPTS OF WHICH LOGIC IS COMPOSED I BELIEVED THAT THE FOUR FOLLOWING WOULD PROVE PERFECTLY SUFFICIENT FOR ME
TRUTH IN THE SCIENCES THE MATHEMATICIANS ALONE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY DEMONSTRATIONS THAT IS ANY CERTAIN AND EVIDENT REASONS I DID NOT DOUBT BUT THAT SUCH MUST HAVE BEEN THE RULE OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
AND THE MAJORITY OF ITS OTHER PRECEPTS ARE OF AVAIL RATHER IN THE COMMUNICATION OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW OR EVEN AS THE ART OF LULLY IN SPEAKING WITHOUT JUDGMENT OF THINGS OF WHICH WE ARE IGNORANT THAN IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE UNKNOWN
BUT AS FOR THE OPINIONS WHICH UP TO THAT TIME I HAD EMBRACED I THOUGHT THAT I COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN RESOLVE AT ONCE TO SWEEP THEM WHOLLY AWAY THAT I MIGHT AFTERWARDS BE IN A POSITION TO ADMIT EITHER OTHERS MORE CORRECT
SERVE FOR PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY WERE NOT ORIGINALLY BUILT THUS ALSO THOSE ANCIENT CITIES WHICH FROM BEING AT FIRST ONLY VILLAGES HAVE BECOME IN COURSE OF TIME LARGE TOWNS
WITHIN AN HOUR WILL YOU ACCOMPANY ME SAID MISTER LORRY JOYFULLY RELIEVED AFTER READING THIS NOTE ALOUD TO WHERE HIS WIFE RESIDES
HAS MUCH INFLUENCE AROUND HIM SURELY IT WILL RELEASE HIM SAID MADAME DEFARGE LET IT DO SO
I WAS ENABLED AS IT APPEARED TO ME TO DETERMINE THE MEANS WHEREBY AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH A SOLUTION WAS POSSIBLE
ARE GENERALLY MORE ELEGANT AND COMMODIOUS THAN THOSE WHICH SEVERAL HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IMPROVE
AND THAT MANY SUCH EXIST THE DIVERSITY OF CONSTITUTIONS IS ALONE SUFFICIENT TO ASSURE US CUSTOM HAS WITHOUT DOUBT MATERIALLY SMOOTHED THEIR INCONVENIENCES AND HAS EVEN MANAGED TO STEER ALTOGETHER CLEAR OF
OR CAPABLE OF BEING MORE DISTINCTLY REPRESENTED TO MY IMAGINATION AND SENSES AND ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IN ORDER TO RETAIN THEM IN THE MEMORY OR EMBRACE AN AGGREGATE OF MANY I SHOULD EXPRESS THEM BY CERTAIN CHARACTERS
AND WITHOUT BY ANY MEANS RESTRICTING THEM TO THESE THAT AFTERWARDS I MIGHT THUS BE THE BETTER ABLE TO APPLY THEM TO EVERY OTHER CLASS OF OBJECTS TO WHICH THEY ARE LEGITIMATELY APPLICABLE
GOVERNED BY OUR DESIRES AND PRECEPTORS WHOSE DICTATES WERE FREQUENTLY CONFLICTING WHILE NEITHER PERHAPS ALWAYS COUNSELED US FOR THE BEST I FARTHER CONCLUDED THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT OUR JUDGMENTS CAN BE SO CORRECT OR SOLID
BOTH THE WOMEN FOLLOWED THE SECOND WOMAN BEING THE VENGEANCE THEY PASSED THROUGH THE INTERVENING STREETS AS QUICKLY AS THEY MIGHT ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE OF THE NEW DOMICILE WERE ADMITTED BY JERRY AND FOUND LUCIE WEEPING
AND IF I THOUGHT THAT THIS TRACT CONTAINED AUGHT WHICH MIGHT JUSTIFY THE SUSPICION THAT I WAS A VICTIM OF SUCH FOLLY I WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT ITS PUBLICATION
I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS THEREFORE RECOMMEND TO EVERY ONE ELSE TO MAKE A SIMILAR ATTEMPT THOSE WHOM GOD HAS ENDOWED WITH A LARGER MEASURE OF GENIUS WILL ENTERTAIN PERHAPS DESIGNS STILL MORE EXALTED
THE CHILD FOR EXAMPLE WHO HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE ELEMENTS OF ARITHMETIC AND HAS MADE A PARTICULAR ADDITION ACCORDING TO RULE
THE SINGLE DESIGN TO STRIP ONE'S SELF OF ALL PAST BELIEFS IS ONE THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE TAKEN BY EVERY ONE THE MAJORITY OF MEN IS COMPOSED OF TWO CLASSES
FOR ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZED VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES IN THIS UNDERTAKING THESE WERE NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT REMEDY NOR ONCE TO BE COMPARED WITH SUCH AS ATTEND THE SLIGHTEST REFORMATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS LARGE BODIES
OF THESE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THAT OCCURRED TO ME WAS THAT THERE IS SELDOM SO MUCH PERFECTION IN WORKS COMPOSED OF MANY SEPARATE PARTS
I HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTS WITH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMMENCE FOR I WAS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW AND CONSIDERING THAT OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO SOUGHT
LOVING THANKFUL WOMANLY ACTION BUT THE HAND MADE NO RESPONSE DROPPED COLD AND HEAVY AND TOOK TO ITS KNITTING AGAIN THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ITS TOUCH THAT GAVE LUCIE A CHECK
I FANCIED THAT THOSE NATIONS WHICH STARTING FROM A SEMI BARBAROUS STATE AND ADVANCING TO CIVILIZATION BY SLOW DEGREES HAVE HAD THEIR LAWS SUCCESSIVELY DETERMINED AND AS IT WERE
AS IT WERE TO USE MY OWN REASON IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE BUT LIKE ONE WALKING ALONE AND IN THE DARK I RESOLVED TO PROCEED SO SLOWLY AND WITH SUCH CIRCUMSPECTION
AND AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR ITS ADEQUATE SOLUTION THE THIRD TO CONDUCT MY THOUGHTS IN SUCH ORDER THAT BY COMMENCING WITH OBJECTS THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW
I REMARKED THAT A PLURALITY OF SUFFRAGES IS NO GUARANTEE OF TRUTH WHERE IT IS AT ALL OF DIFFICULT DISCOVERY AS IN SUCH CASES IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT IT WILL BE FOUND BY ONE THAN BY MANY
THAT I CANNOT IN ANY DEGREE APPROVE OF THOSE RESTLESS AND BUSY MEDDLERS WHO CALLED NEITHER BY BIRTH NOR FORTUNE TO TAKE PART IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS ARE YET ALWAYS PROJECTING REFORMS
I TOOK INTO ACCOUNT ALSO THE VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER WHICH A PERSON BROUGHT UP FROM INFANCY IN FRANCE OR GERMANY EXHIBITS FROM THAT WHICH
I HAVE NEVER CONTEMPLATED ANYTHING HIGHER THAN THE REFORMATION OF MY OWN OPINIONS AND BASING THEM ON A FOUNDATION WHOLLY MY OWN AND ALTHOUGH MY OWN SATISFACTION WITH MY WORK HAS LED ME TO PRESENT HERE A DRAFT OF IT
NOR IN THIS PERHAPS SHALL I APPEAR TOO VAIN IF IT BE CONSIDERED THAT AS THE TRUTH ON ANY PARTICULAR POINT IS ONE WHOEVER APPREHENDS THE TRUTH KNOWS ALL THAT ON THAT POINT CAN BE KNOWN
AMONG THE BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY I HAD AT AN EARLIER PERIOD GIVEN SOME ATTENTION TO LOGIC AND AMONG THOSE OF THE MATHEMATICS TO GEOMETRICAL ANALYSIS AND ALGEBRA
I THOUGHT THAT IN ORDER THE BETTER TO CONSIDER THEM INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD VIEW THEM AS SUBSISTING BETWEEN STRAIGHT LINES THAN WHICH I COULD FIND NO OBJECTS MORE SIMPLE
USING HIS NATURAL AND UNPREJUDICED JUDGMENT DRAWS RESPECTING THE MATTERS OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL TO PASS THROUGH A STATE OF INFANCY TO MANHOOD AND HAVE BEEN OF NECESSITY FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
KISS OUR CHILD FOR ME THAT WAS ALL THE WRITING IT WAS SO MUCH HOWEVER TO HER WHO RECEIVED IT
WHICH I DID NOT CLEARLY KNOW TO BE SUCH THAT IS TO SAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID PRECIPITANCY AND PREJUDICE AND TO COMPRISE NOTHING MORE IN MY JUDGEMENT THAN WHAT WAS PRESENTED
WHOSE OPINIONS ARE DECIDEDLY REPUGNANT TO OURS ARE NOT IN THAT ACCOUNT BARBARIANS AND SAVAGES BUT ON THE CONTRARY THAT MANY OF THESE NATIONS MAKE AN EQUALLY GOOD IF NOT BETTER USE OF THEIR REASON THAN WE DO
LITTLE THINKING WHAT IT HAD BEEN DOING NEAR HIM IN THE NIGHT AND MIGHT BUT FOR A CHANCE HAVE DONE TO HIM DEAREST TAKE COURAGE I AM WELL AND YOUR FATHER HAS INFLUENCE AROUND ME YOU CANNOT ANSWER THIS
BUT I HAD BECOME AWARE EVEN SO EARLY AS DURING MY COLLEGE LIFE THAT NO OPINION HOWEVER ABSURD AND INCREDIBLE CAN BE IMAGINED WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MAINTAINED BY SOME ON OF THE PHILOSOPHERS AND AFTERWARDS
WAS THE ASSURANCE I HAD OF THEREBY EXERCISING MY REASON IN ALL MATTERS IF NOT WITH ABSOLUTE PERFECTION AT LEAST WITH THE GREATEST ATTAINABLE BY ME BESIDES I WAS CONSCIOUS
EITHER INJURIOUS OR SUPERFLUOUS MINGLED WITH THE FORMER THAT IT IS ALMOST QUITE AS DIFFICULT TO EFFECT A SEVERANCE OF THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE AS IT IS TO EXTRACT A DIANA OR A MINERVA FROM A ROUGH BLOCK OF MARBLE
JUDGE YOU IS IT LIKELY THAT THE TROUBLE OF ONE WIFE AND MOTHER WOULD BE MUCH TO US NOW SHE RESUMED HER KNITTING AND WENT OUT THE VENGEANCE FOLLOWED
SUBSISTING AMONG THOSE OBJECTS I THOUGHT IT BEST FOR MY PURPOSE TO CONSIDER THESE PROPORTIONS IN THE MOST GENERAL FORM POSSIBLE WITHOUT REFERRING THEM TO ANY OBJECTS IN PARTICULAR
THAT WE CANNOT DISCOVER IT PROVIDED ONLY WE ABSTAIN FROM ACCEPTING THE FALSE FOR THE TRUE AND ALWAYS PRESERVE IN OUR THOUGHTS THE ORDER NECESSARY FOR THE DEDUCTION OF ONE TRUTH FROM ANOTHER AND
AND EVERY MINUTE'S DELAY TENDING TO COMPROMISE TELLSON'S MISTER LORRY ADVISED WITH LUCIE SHE SAID THAT HER FATHER HAD SPOKEN OF HIRING A LODGING FOR A SHORT TERM IN THAT QUARTER NEAR THE BANKING HOUSE AS THERE WAS NO BUSINESS OBJECTION TO THIS
OR WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS ARE INSECURE WITH THIS BEFORE ME BY WAY OF EXAMPLE I WAS PERSUADED THAT IT WOULD INDEED BE PREPOSTEROUS FOR A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TO THINK OF REFORMING A STATE BY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING IT THROUGHOUT
INFLUENCE HE SAYS SOMETHING TOUCHING INFLUENCE
BUT TO USE IT IN HIS BEHALF O SISTER WOMAN THINK OF ME AS A WIFE AND MOTHER
A SHADOW INDEED NO SUBSTANCE IN IT LUCIE BUT THE SHADOW OF THE MANNER OF THESE DEFARGES WAS DARK UPON HIMSELF FOR ALL THAT
THEN AS TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE ANCIENTS AND THE ALGEBRA OF THE MODERNS BESIDES THAT THEY EMBRACE ONLY MATTERS HIGHLY ABSTRACT AND TO APPEARANCE OF NO USE THE FORMER IS SO EXCLUSIVELY RESTRICTED
AND HAD WE ALWAYS BEEN GUIDED BY IT ALONE IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO PULL DOWN ALL THE HOUSES OF A TOWN WITH THE SINGLE DESIGN OF REBUILDING THEM DIFFERENTLY
I STATE THE CASE CITIZEN DEFARGE
HAVE FOLLOWED THE APPOINTMENTS OF SOME WISE LEGISLATOR IT IS THUS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TRUE RELIGION THE ORDINANCES OF WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM GOD MUST BE INCOMPARABLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF EVERY OTHER
AND CLOSED THE DOOR COURAGE MY DEAR LUCIE SAID MISTER LORRY AS HE RAISED HER COURAGE COURAGE SO FAR ALL GOES WELL WITH US
UPON WHICH DIFFERENT HANDS HAD BEEN EMPLOYED AS IN THOSE COMPLETED BY A SINGLE MASTER THUS IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT THE BUILDINGS WHICH A SINGLE ARCHITECT HAS PLANNED AND EXECUTED
THE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE IN THIS WAY I BELIEVED THAT I COULD BORROW ALL THAT WAS BEST BOTH IN GEOMETRICAL ANALYSIS AND IN ALGEBRA AND CORRECT ALL THE DEFECTS OF THE ONE BY HELP OF THE OTHER
FORCED UPON THEM SIMPLY BY EXPERIENCE OF THE HURTFULNESS OF PARTICULAR CRIMES AND DISPUTES WOULD BY THIS PROCESS COME TO BE POSSESSED OF LESS PERFECT INSTITUTIONS THAN THOSE WHICH FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THEIR ASSOCIATION AS COMMUNITIES
WHO HAD LEFT HER IN EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE SOME SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO IT IS SHE OBSERVED HER HUSBAND DOES MADAME GO WITH US INQUIRED MISTER LORRY SEEING THAT SHE MOVED AS THEY MOVED
OFTEN ENOUGH ALL OUR LIVES WE HAVE SEEN OUR SISTER WOMEN SUFFER IN THEMSELVES AND IN THEIR CHILDREN POVERTY NAKEDNESS HUNGER THIRST SICKNESS
PROVIDED I TOOK THE FIRM AND UNWAVERING RESOLUTION NEVER IN A SINGLE INSTANCE TO FAIL IN OBSERVING THEM THE FIRST WAS NEVER TO ACCEPT ANYTHING FOR TRUE
NOT VISIBLE AND PRESENTED BUT INDISTINCT AND WITHHELD TO ALARM LUCIE INTO SAYING AS SHE LAID HER APPEALING HAND ON MADAME DEFARGE'S DRESS
AND IN POINT OF FACT THE ACCURATE OBSERVANCE OF THESE FEW PRECEPTS GAVE ME I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF SAYING SUCH EASE IN UNRAVELING ALL THE QUESTIONS EMBRACED IN THESE TWO SCIENCES
WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DEMUR BUT THE GREAT TRUST HE HELD WAS NOT HIS OWN AND AS TO THAT BUSINESS CHARGE
AND RIDICULOUS I WAS THUS LED TO INFER THAT THE GROUND OF OUR OPINIONS IS FAR MORE CUSTOM AND EXAMPLE THAN ANY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE AND FINALLY ALTHOUGH SUCH BE THE GROUND OF OUR OPINIONS
AND TO SPEAK OF HUMAN AFFAIRS I BELIEVE THAT THE PRE EMINENCE OF SPARTA WAS DUE NOT TO THE GOODNESS OF EACH OF ITS LAWS IN PARTICULAR FOR MANY OF THESE WERE VERY STRANGE AND EVEN OPPOSED TO GOOD MORALS BUT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT
SHE STOPPED IN THE ACT OF PUTTING THE NOTE IN HER BOSOM AND WITH HER HANDS YET AT HER NECK LOOKED TERRIFIED AT MADAME DEFARGE
IN WHICH I FOUND NOTHING CERTAIN I THOUGHT IT NECESSARY FIRST OF ALL TO ENDEAVOR TO ESTABLISH ITS PRINCIPLES AND BECAUSE I OBSERVED
OR INSENSIBLY CORRECTED A NUMBER WHICH SAGACITY COULD NOT HAVE PROVIDED AGAINST WITH EQUAL EFFECT AND IN FINE THE DEFECTS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS MORE TOLERABLE
WAS THIS THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO IMPERIL TELLSON'S BY SHELTERING THE WIFE OF AN EMIGRANT PRISONER UNDER THE BANK ROOF HIS OWN POSSESSIONS SAFETY LIFE HE WOULD HAVE HAZARDED FOR LUCIE AND HER CHILD
AND HE THOUGHT OF FINDING OUT THE WINE SHOP AGAIN AND TAKING COUNSEL WITH ITS MASTER IN REFERENCE TO THE SAFEST DWELLING PLACE IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE CITY BUT THE SAME CONSIDERATION THAT SUGGESTED HIM
IN A FEW MOMENTS A MAN STOOD IN HIS PRESENCE WHO WITH A KEENLY OBSERVANT LOOK AT HIM ADDRESSED HIM BY HIS NAME YOUR SERVANT SAID MISTER LORRY DO YOU KNOW ME HE WAS A STRONGLY MADE MAN
YOU WILL DO HIM NO HARM YOU WILL HELP ME TO SEE HIM IF YOU CAN YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT MY BUSINESS HERE RETURNED MADAME DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE IT IS THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR FATHER WHO IS MY BUSINESS HERE
SHE ALSO BESTOWED A BRITISH COUGH ON MADAME DEFARGE BUT NEITHER OF THE TWO TOOK MUCH HEED OF HER
I SHOULD MUCH BETTER SUCCEED IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE THAN IF I BUILT ONLY UPON OLD FOUNDATIONS AND LEANED UPON PRINCIPLES WHICH IN MY YOUTH I HAD TAKEN UPON TRUST
AND BY WHOM THEY MAY BE INSTRUCTED OUGHT RATHER TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE OPINIONS OF SUCH THAN TRUST FOR MORE CORRECT TO THEIR OWN REASON FOR MY OWN PART
FOR THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTRARY TO THE ORDER PRESCRIBED IN THE METHOD
YES THAT SHE MAY BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE THE FACES AND KNOW THE PERSONS IT IS FOR THEIR SAFETY BEGINNING TO BE STRUCK BY DEFARGE'S MANNER MISTER LORRY LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIM AND LED THE WAY
CHAPTER FOUR A PRISONER WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TEN MILES WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE VERY RAPIDLY WE WERE AS I WAS LATER TO LEARN NEARING THE EDGE OF ONE OF MARS LONG DEAD SEAS IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
TO LOOK UPON ME WITH LESS FEROCITY BUT AS I WAS TO LEARN LATER THE THING WHICH WEIGHED MOST IN MY FAVOR WAS MY EXHIBITION OF HURDLING WHILE THE MARTIANS ARE IMMENSE THEIR BONES ARE VERY LARGE
ONLY ABOUT ONE MARTIAN IN A THOUSAND DIES OF SICKNESS OR DISEASE AND POSSIBLY ABOUT TWENTY TAKE THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE THE OTHER NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DIE VIOLENT DEATHS IN DUELS IN HUNTING
MY ATTEMPTS TO WALK RESULTED IN A VARIETY OF HOPS WHICH TOOK ME CLEAR OF THE GROUND A COUPLE OF FEET AT EACH STEP AND LANDED ME SPRAWLING UPON MY FACE OR BACK
TRAILED NINETEEN OTHERS SIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS BUT AS I LEARNED LATER BEARING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES PRECISELY
OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
MY FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS HOWEVER AS THE OTHER MARTIANS AT FIRST STRUCK DUMB WITH WONDERMENT FINALLY BROKE INTO WILD PEALS OF LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE APPLAUSE AS SUCH BUT LATER
SOME WERE SURVEYING ME WITH EXPRESSIONS WHICH I AFTERWARD DISCOVERED MARKED EXTREME ASTONISHMENT AND THE OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT I HAD NOT MOLESTED THEIR YOUNG
AT THE SAME TIME HE MOTIONED HIS FOLLOWERS TO ADVANCE THEY STARTED TOWARD US ON A WILD RUN
THESE LATTER ADD A MOST FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE TO AN OTHERWISE FEARSOME AND TERRIBLE COUNTENANCE AS THE LOWER TUSKS CURVE UPWARD TO SHARP POINTS WHICH END ABOUT WHERE THE EYES OF EARTHLY HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOCATED
FROM MY PURSUERS AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE I ALIGHTED UPON THE SOFT MOSS EASILY AND WITHOUT MISHAP AND TURNING SAW MY ENEMIES LINED UP ALONG THE FURTHER WALL
AND SOME TELEPATHIC FORCE MUST HAVE WARNED ME AGAINST AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT FROM UNDER THE MUZZLES OF TWENTY OF THESE DEATH DEALING MACHINES
CHAPTER THREE MY ADVENT ON MARS I OPENED MY EYES UPON A STRANGE AND WEIRD LANDSCAPE I KNEW THAT I WAS ON MARS NOT ONCE DID I QUESTION EITHER MY SANITY OR MY WAKEFULNESS
BUT I WAS NOT LONG IN BEING ENLIGHTENED THEY FIRST REPEATED THE WORD SAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN TARS TARKAS MADE SEVERAL JUMPS REPEATING THE SAME WORD BEFORE EACH LEAP THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID SAK
GAY COLORED FEATHERS AND BEAUTIFULLY WROUGHT LEATHER TRAPPINGS INGENIOUSLY SET WITH PRECIOUS STONES FROM HIS SHOULDERS DEPENDED A SHORT CAPE OF WHITE FUR LINED WITH BRILLIANT SCARLET SILK WHAT STRUCK ME AS MOST REMARKABLE
FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TURNING THE HEAD THE EARS WHICH WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE EYES AND CLOSER TOGETHER WERE SMALL CUP SHAPED ANTENNAE PROTRUDING NOT MORE THAN AN INCH ON THESE YOUNG SPECIMENS
WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR THE WEIGHT OF THESE RIFLES IS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE AND WITH THE SMALL CALIBER EXPLOSIVE RADIUM PROJECTILES WHICH THEY USE AND THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE BARREL
OWING TO THE WANING RESOURCES OF THE PLANET IT EVIDENTLY BECAME NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE INCREASING LONGEVITY WHICH THEIR REMARKABLE SKILL IN THERAPEUTICS AND SURGERY PRODUCED
WHEREAS THE GREAT BULKS OF THE MARTIANS
LIKE AN OBEDIENT PUPPY THE THING WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHETLAND PONY
IS TO INFLICT DEATH ON THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR IN VARIOUS INGENIOUS AND HORRIBLE WAYS THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS AND CHIEFTAINS EXAMINED ME CLOSELY FEELING MY MUSCLES AND THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN
THEY WERE CONVERSING TOGETHER IN LOW TONES AND GESTICULATING AND POINTING TOWARD ME THEIR DISCOVERY THAT I HAD NOT HARMED THE LITTLE MARTIANS AND THAT I WAS UNARMED MUST HAVE CAUSED THEM
AND WAS BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WITH MURAL PAINTINGS AND MOSAICS
FOR SUCH I NOW CONSIDERED THEM DESPITE THE SUAVE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD BEEN TRAPPED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THEIR ORNAMENTS ALL WERE NAKED THE WOMEN VARIED IN APPEARANCE BUT LITTLE FROM THE MEN EXCEPT THAT THEIR TUSKS WERE MUCH LARGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR HEIGHT
WITHOUT A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION AS WE NEARED THE PLAZA AND MY PRESENCE WAS DISCOVERED WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PLUCK ME FROM MY SEAT BEHIND MY GUARD A WORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY
THEIR NOSES WERE BUT LONGITUDINAL SLITS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR FACES MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS THERE WAS NO HAIR ON THEIR BODIES
HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
AND ONE OTHER ANIMAL THE ONLY MAMMAL EXISTING ON MARS ALONE HAVE WELL FORMED NAILS AND THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO HOOFED ANIMALS IN EXISTENCE THERE BEHIND THIS FIRST CHARGING DEMON
WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
AN ENORMOUS CITY TOWARD THIS WE GALLOPED ENTERING IT BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RUINED ROADWAY LEADING OUT FROM THE CITY BUT ONLY TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE LAND WHERE IT ENDED ABRUPTLY IN A FLIGHT OF BROAD STEPS
AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED TWO LEGS AND TWO ARMS WITH AN INTERMEDIARY PAIR OF LIMBS WHICH COULD BE USED AT WILL EITHER AS ARMS OR LEGS THEIR EYES WERE SET AT THE EXTREME SIDES OF THEIR HEADS A TRIFLE ABOVE THE CENTER
HOW CAN EARTHLY WORDS DESCRIBE IT IT TOWERED TEN FEET AT THE SHOULDER HAD FOUR LEGS ON EITHER SIDE A BROAD FLAT TAIL LARGER AT THE TIP THAN AT THE ROOT AND WHICH IT HELD
I GRASPED HER PROFFERED ARM AND TOGETHER WE CROSSED THE PLAZA TOWARD A LARGE BUILDING ON THE FAR SIDE MY FAIR COMPANION WAS ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL HAVING JUST ARRIVED AT MATURITY BUT NOT YET TO HER FULL HEIGHT
BUT I NOTICED THAT WHEN I SMILED SLIGHTLY ON CONCLUDING HE DID LIKEWISE THIS FACT AND THE SIMILAR OCCURRENCE DURING MY FIRST TALK WITH TARS TARKAS CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAD AT LEAST SOMETHING IN COMMON THE ABILITY TO SMILE
ITS BELLY WAS WHITE AND ITS LEGS SHADED FROM THE SLATE OF ITS SHOULDERS AND HIPS TO A VIVID YELLOW AT THE FEET THE FEET THEMSELVES WERE HEAVILY PADDED AND NAILLESS
THE WHITENESS OF THE TEETH IS NOT THAT OF IVORY BUT OF THE SNOWIEST AND MOST GLEAMING OF CHINA AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THEIR OLIVE SKINS THEIR TUSKS STAND OUT IN A MOST STRIKING MANNER
I WAS NOT ASLEEP NO NEED FOR PINCHING HERE MY INNER CONSCIOUSNESS TOLD ME AS PLAINLY THAT I WAS UPON MARS AS YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE UPON EARTH YOU DO NOT QUESTION THE FACT
AND WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED THE CHIEFTAIN ADDRESSED ME AT SOME LENGTH I REPLIED IN OUR GOOD OLD ENGLISH TONGUE MERELY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT NEITHER OF US COULD UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
THE IRREGULARITIES OF LOW HILLS IT WAS MIDDAY THE SUN WAS SHINING FULL UPON ME AND THE HEAT OF IT WAS RATHER INTENSE UPON MY NAKED BODY YET NO GREATER
AS TO STRIKE AGAINST THE BUTT OF HIS GREAT METAL SHOD SPEAR I SHOULD HAVE SNUFFED OUT WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT DEATH WAS NEAR ME BUT THE LITTLE SOUND CAUSED ME TO TURN
NOW COMMENCED A SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS WHICH EVEN THEN SEEMED LUDICROUS IN THE EXTREME I FOUND THAT I MUST LEARN TO WALK ALL OVER AGAIN
HE SAT HIS MOUNT AS WE SIT A HORSE GRASPING THE ANIMAL'S BARREL WITH HIS LOWER LIMBS WHILE THE HANDS OF HIS TWO RIGHT ARMS HELD HIS IMMENSE SPEAR LOW AT THE SIDE OF HIS MOUNT
HIS TWO LEFT ARMS WERE OUTSTRETCHED LATERALLY TO HELP PRESERVE HIS BALANCE THE THING HE RODE HAVING NEITHER BRIDLE OR REINS OF ANY DESCRIPTION FOR GUIDANCE AND HIS MOUNT
MADE A PECULIAR HISSING SOUND AS THOUGH SIGNALING TO SOMEONE IN AN ADJOINING ROOM IN RESPONSE TO HER CALL I OBTAINED MY FIRST SIGHT OF A NEW MARTIAN WONDER IT WADDLED IN ON ITS TEN SHORT LEGS AND SQUATTED DOWN BEFORE THE GIRL
STRAIGHT OUT BEHIND WHILE RUNNING A GAPING MOUTH WHICH SPLIT ITS HEAD FROM ITS SNOUT TO ITS LONG MASSIVE NECK LIKE ITS MASTER IT WAS ENTIRELY DEVOID OF HAIR
WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON AN ARIZONA DESERT HERE AND THERE WERE SLIGHT OUTCROPPINGS OF QUARTZ BEARING ROCK WHICH GLISTENED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE TO MY LEFT PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS APPEARED A LOW WALLED ENCLOSURE
WHICH WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE ON EARTH THE THEORETIC EFFECTIVE RADIUS OF THIS RIFLE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT THE BEST THEY CAN DO IN ACTUAL SERVICE
TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
AS I TURNED TO MEET IT UNARMED AND NAKED AS I WAS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF MY IMMEDIATE PROBLEM AND THAT WAS TO GET OUT OF THE VICINITY
SMILED AT HIM AND STOOD WAITING HIS WIDE MOUTH SPREAD INTO AN ANSWERING SMILE AND LOCKING ONE OF HIS INTERMEDIARY ARMS IN MINE WE TURNED AND WALKED BACK TOWARD HIS MOUNT
OF THE POINT OF THE CHARGING SPEAR CONSEQUENTLY I GAVE A VERY EARTHLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SUPERHUMAN LEAP TO REACH THE TOP OF THE MARTIAN INCUBATOR FOR SUCH I HAD DETERMINED IT MUST BE
AND BENEATH THIS WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED LARGE EGGS PERFECTLY ROUND AND SNOWY WHITE THE EGGS WERE NEARLY UNIFORM IN SIZE BEING ABOUT TWO AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER FIVE OR SIX HAD ALREADY HATCHED
TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CITY WAS A LARGE PLAZA AND UPON THIS AND IN THE BUILDINGS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING IT WERE CAMPED SOME NINE OR TEN HUNDRED CREATURES OF THE SAME BREED AS MY CAPTORS
MY MUSCLES PERFECTLY ATTUNED AND ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ON EARTH PLAYED THE MISCHIEF WITH ME IN ATTEMPTING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COPE WITH THE LESSER GRAVITATION AND LOWER AIR PRESSURE ON MARS
SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
ON SUCH A LITTLE THING MY LIFE HUNG THAT I OFTEN MARVEL THAT I ESCAPED SO EASILY HAD NOT THE RIFLE OF THE LEADER OF THE PARTY SWUNG FROM ITS FASTENINGS BESIDE HIS SADDLE IN SUCH A WAY
IN AVIATION AND IN WAR BUT PERHAPS BY FAR THE GREATEST DEATH LOSS COMES DURING THE AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN VAST NUMBERS OF THE LITTLE MARTIANS FALL VICTIMS TO THE GREAT WHITE APES OF MARS
NOR WAS THERE ROOM BENEATH THE DESKS FOR THEIR LONG LEGS EVIDENTLY THEN THERE WERE OTHER DENIZENS ON MARS THAN THE WILD AND GROTESQUE CREATURES INTO WHOSE HANDS I HAD FALLEN BUT THE EVIDENCES OF EXTREME ANTIQUITY
AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UPON EARTH AND FROM DESIRING TO ANNIHILATE ME THEY SUDDENLY LOOKED UPON ME AS A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY TO BE CAPTURED AND EXHIBITED AMONG THEIR FELLOWS THE RESPITE
AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
WHEN I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR CUSTOMS I LEARNED THAT I HAD WON WHAT THEY SELDOM ACCORD A MANIFESTATION OF APPROBATION THE FELLOW WHOM I HAD STRUCK LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN
IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS FRONTING ON THE PLAZA AND WHICH FROM THE LITTER OF SILKS AND FURS UPON THE FLOOR I TOOK TO BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE NATIVES THE ROOM WAS WELL LIGHTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE WINDOWS
AS NO TWO OF US ARE IDENTICAL ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALL CAST IN A SIMILAR MOLD THIS PICTURE OR RATHER MATERIALIZED NIGHTMARE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AT LENGTH
HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
STILLED THEIR CLAMOR AND WE PROCEEDED AT A TROT ACROSS THE PLAZA TO THE ENTRANCE OF AS MAGNIFICENT AN EDIFICE AS MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON THE BUILDING WAS LOW BUT COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
AND THE GROTESQUE CARICATURES WHICH SAT BLINKING IN THE SUNLIGHT WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE ME TO DOUBT MY SANITY THEY SEEMED MOSTLY HEAD WITH LITTLE SCRAWNY BODIES LONG NECKS AND SIX LEGS OR
WITHOUT FALLING I THEN RETURNED BY EASY JUMPS OF TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FEET TO THE LITTLE GROUP OF WARRIORS MY EXHIBITION HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED LESSER MARTIANS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY BROKE INTO DEMANDS FOR A REPETITION
EVIDENTLY HE FEARED THAT WERE I TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENED AGAIN I MIGHT JUMP ENTIRELY OUT OF THE LANDSCAPE HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH HIS MEN MOTIONED TO ME THAT I WOULD RIDE BEHIND ONE OF THEM AND THEN MOUNTED HIS OWN ANIMAL
I CONCLUDED TO HAZARD A LITTLE CONVERSATION ON MY OWN PART AS I HAD GUESSED THAT HE WAS MAKING OVERTURES OF PEACE THE THROWING DOWN OF HIS WEAPONS AND THE WITHDRAWING OF HIS TROOP BEFORE HIS ADVANCE TOWARD ME
AND I DID THE ONLY THING A GENTLEMAN MIGHT DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BRUTALITY BOORISHNESS AND LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR A STRANGER'S RIGHTS I SWUNG MY FIST SQUARELY TO HIS JAW AND HE WENT DOWN LIKE A FELLED OX
WHEN EQUIPPED WITH THEIR WIRELESS FINDERS AND SIGHTERS IS BUT A TRIFLE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES THIS IS QUITE FAR ENOUGH TO IMBUE ME WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MARTIAN FIREARM
AND SO NOW I WENT SKIPPING AND FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE DESKS AND CHAIRS LIKE SOME MONSTROUS GRASSHOPPER AFTER BRUISING MYSELF SEVERELY
AS THE MUSCULAR EXERTION WHICH CARRIED ME EASILY AND SAFELY UPON EARTH PLAYED STRANGE ANTICS WITH ME UPON MARS INSTEAD OF PROGRESSING IN A SANE AND DIGNIFIED MANNER
AT THE TIME THIS CEREMONY AND THE WORDS THEY UTTERED MEANT NOTHING TO ME BUT LATER I CAME TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS THE CUSTOMARY GREETING BETWEEN GREEN MARTIANS HAD THE MEN BEEN STRANGERS AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO EXCHANGE NAMES
IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
THE ADULT FEMALES RANGED IN HEIGHT FROM TEN TO TWELVE FEET THE CHILDREN WERE LIGHT IN COLOR EVEN LIGHTER THAN THE WOMEN AND ALL LOOKED PRECISELY ALIKE TO ME EXCEPT THAT SOME WERE TALLER
ABOUT THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE HALL IN WHICH THEY WERE CONGREGATED WAS THE FACT THAT THE CREATURES WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DESKS CHAIRS AND OTHER FURNISHINGS THESE BEING OF A SIZE ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS SUCH AS I
WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCORD I THEREFORE IGNORED THE REPEATED COMMANDS TO SAK AND EACH TIME THEY WERE MADE I MOTIONED TO MY MOUTH AND RUBBED MY STOMACH
THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
ABOUT FOUR FEET IN HEIGHT NO WATER AND NO OTHER VEGETATION THAN THE MOSS WAS IN EVIDENCE AND AS I WAS SOMEWHAT THIRSTY I DETERMINED TO DO A LITTLE EXPLORING SPRINGING TO MY FEET I RECEIVED MY FIRST MARTIAN SURPRISE
MY EFFORT WAS CROWNED WITH A SUCCESS WHICH APPALLED ME NO LESS THAN IT SEEMED TO SURPRISE THE MARTIAN WARRIORS FOR IT CARRIED ME FULLY THIRTY FEET INTO THE AIR AND LANDED ME A HUNDRED FEET
THE FELLOW DESIGNATED REACHED DOWN TWO OR THREE HANDS AND LIFTED ME UP BEHIND HIM ON THE GLOSSY BACK OF HIS MOUNT
WHEN HE WAS WITHIN ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF ME HE UNCLASPED AN ENORMOUS METAL ARMLET AND HOLDING IT TOWARD ME IN THE OPEN PALM OF HIS HAND ADDRESSED ME IN A CLEAR RESONANT VOICE
WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THEN ORDERED ME TO MAKE BUT I WAS BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DETERMINED ON THE SPOT THAT MY ONLY METHOD OF SALVATION WAS TO DEMAND THE CONSIDERATION FROM THESE CREATURES
NEITHER DID I I FOUND MYSELF LYING PRONE UPON A BED OF YELLOWISH MOSSLIKE VEGETATION WHICH STRETCHED AROUND ME IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR INTERMINABLE MILES I SEEMED TO BE LYING IN A DEEP
HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
THEREFORE TO LAUGH DENOTING A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT I WAS TO LEARN THAT THE MARTIAN SMILE IS MERELY PERFUNCTORY AND THAT THE MARTIAN LAUGH IS A THING TO CAUSE STRONG MEN TO BLANCH IN HORROR THE IDEAS
MAKING THESE WEAPONS PRESENT A SINGULARLY FORMIDABLE APPEARANCE MOST OF THESE DETAILS I NOTED LATER FOR I WAS GIVEN BUT LITTLE TIME TO SPECULATE ON THE WONDERS OF MY NEW DISCOVERY
WHEN THEY HAD COVERED PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS THEY HALTED AND TURNING THEIR MOUNTS TOWARD US SAT WATCHING THE WARRIOR BY THE ENCLOSURE HE WAS THE ONE WHOSE SPEAR HAD SO NEARLY TRANSFIXED ME
TARS TARKAS AND THE CHIEF EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS AND THE FORMER CALLING TO A YOUNG FEMALE AMONG THE THRONG GAVE HER SOME INSTRUCTIONS AND MOTIONED ME TO ACCOMPANY HER
UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION I SAW AS WE PASSED THEM THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE DESERTED AND WHILE NOT GREATLY DECAYED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING BEEN TENANTED FOR YEARS POSSIBLY FOR AGES
AND THERE UPON ME NOT TEN FEET FROM MY BREAST WAS THE POINT OF THAT HUGE SPEAR A SPEAR FORTY FEET LONG TIPPED WITH GLEAMING METAL AND HELD LOW AT THE SIDE OF A MOUNTED REPLICA
AND SO HUMAN LIFE HAS COME TO BE CONSIDERED BUT LIGHTLY ON MARS AS IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR DANGEROUS SPORTS AND THE ALMOST CONTINUAL WARFARE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES
I WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER TO EXPLORE THE LOW STRUCTURE WHICH WAS THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF HABITATION IN SIGHT
IT HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN ME TO SEE THE ROOF OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS OF SOLID GLASS
WAS FULLY FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT
AND CAME AROUND THE END OF THE INCUBATOR TOWARD ME ENTIRELY UNARMED AND AS NAKED AS I EXCEPT FOR THE ORNAMENTS STRAPPED UPON HIS HEAD LIMBS AND BREAST
BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION WITH WHICH I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED MY WORDS STRETCHING MY HAND TOWARD HIM I ADVANCED AND TOOK THE ARMLET FROM HIS OPEN PALM CLASPING IT ABOUT MY ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW
IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
I SAW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND GATHERING MYSELF TOGETHER I SAKKED WITH SUCH MARVELOUS SUCCESS THAT I CLEARED A GOOD HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET NOR DID I THIS TIME LOSE MY EQUILIBRIUM BUT LANDED SQUARELY UPON MY FEET
WHICH LEADS NO LIVING MARTIAN KNOWS WHITHER AND FROM WHOSE BOSOM NO MARTIAN HAS EVER RETURNED OR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE DID HE RETURN AFTER ONCE EMBARKING UPON ITS COLD DARK WATERS
MY CAPTOR MERELY STRODE UP TO THE ROSTRUM THE OTHERS MAKING WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE CHIEFTAIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND UTTERED THE NAME OF MY ESCORT WHO IN TURN HALTED AND REPEATED THE NAME OF THE RULER FOLLOWED BY HIS TITLE
MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE MARTIANS HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A SHORT TIME WE GAINED THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND AFTER TRAVERSING A NARROW GORGE CAME TO AN OPEN VALLEY AT THE FAR EXTREMITY OF WHICH WAS A LOW TABLE LAND UPON WHICH I BEHELD
THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFTAIN THEN EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED A DESIRE TO SEE ME PERFORM AND MOTIONING ME TO FOLLOW HE STARTED WITH TARS TARKAS FOR THE OPEN PLAZA NOW I HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO WALK SINCE MY FIRST SIGNAL FAILURE
AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
MULLINS AND BAGSHAW AND JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH AND THE REST ARE IT IS TRUE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE BUT I HAVE KNOWN THEM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF FORMS WITH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF TALL AND SHORT DARK AND FAIR THAT INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW THEM
I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
A LAND OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE WHERE LITTLE TOWNS SPREAD THEIR SQUARE STREETS AND THEIR TRIM MAPLE TREES BESIDE PLACID LAKES ALMOST WITHIN ECHO OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST IS LARGE ENOUGH
IN REGARD TO THE PRESENT WORK I MUST DISCLAIM AT ONCE ALL INTENTIONS OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUSLY EASY AS WRITING ABOUT A REAL PLACE AND REAL PEOPLE MARIPOSA IS NOT A REAL TOWN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY OF THEM
IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
ELSE HOW WAS IT THAT HENRY MULLINS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SELLING A DRAFT FOR FORTY THOUSAND ON NEW YORK AND WHY WAS IT THAT MISTER SMITH WOULDN'T PAY BILLY THE DESK CLERK HIS BACK WAGES WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT IT INTO CUBA OH YES SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE SEEN IT
AND BY MEANS OF THIS AND SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT BY MC GILL UNIVERSITY I SURVIVED UNTIL I TOOK THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN NINETEEN O THREE THE MEANING OF THIS DEGREE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF INSTRUCTION IS EXAMINED FOR THE LAST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND IS PRONOUNCED COMPLETELY FULL
IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
COULD WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE AND BUY BOTH OF THESE BOOKS FOR SEVEN SHILLINGS YET THESE WORKS ARE OF SO HUMOROUS A CHARACTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO PRINT THEM THE COMPOSITORS FELL BACK FROM THEIR TASK SUFFOCATED WITH LAUGHTER AND GASPING FOR AIR
AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT OF ONE'S OWN MIND WORTH READING FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS AN ARDUOUS CONTRIVANCE ONLY TO BE ACHIEVED IN FORTUNATE MOMENTS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI
I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
THAT IS INDUCED BY HONEST MANUAL TOIL I WAS EDUCATED AT UPPER CANADA COLLEGE TORONTO OF WHICH I WAS HEAD BOY IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FROM THERE I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHERE I GRADUATED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
I MAY SAY IN PARENTHESES THAT IT WAS A FAVOURITE METHOD IN MARIPOSA IF YOU WANTED TO GET AT THE REAL WORTH OF A MAN TO IMAGINE HIM CLEAN SOLD UP PUT UP FOR AUCTION AS IT WERE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO TEST HIM AND NOW LOOK AT EM JEFF WENT ON
A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
AT THE UNIVERSITY I SPENT MY ENTIRE TIME IN THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGES LIVING DEAD AND HALF DEAD AND KNEW NOTHING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THIS DILIGENT PURSUIT OF WORDS I SPENT ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS OF EACH DAY
AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
THE FAULT LIES RATHER WITH AN ART THAT IS DEFICIENT THAN IN AN AFFECTION THAT IS WANTING
THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
BUT IF A FELLER KNOWS THE COUNTRY AND KEEPS HIS HEAD LEVEL HE CAN'T LOSE JEFFERSON HAD LOOKED AT SO MANY PROSPECTUSES AND SO MANY PICTURES OF MINES AND PINE TREES AND SMELTERS THAT I THINK HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN THE COUNTRY ANYWAY WHAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILES
THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
THERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITH
WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
AND NEEDS A TELLER AS FOR MISTER SMITH WITH HIS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POUNDS HIS HOARSE VOICE HIS LOUD CHECK SUIT
IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
THAT WAS JEFF'S MONEY PART OF IT MULLINS GOT THE TELEGRAM FROM A BROKER OR SOMEONE AND HE SHOWED IT TO JEFF JUST AS HE WAS GOING UP THE STREET WITH AN ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK AT A BIG EMPTY LOT ON THE HILL BEHIND THE TOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR THESE INCURABLES
CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
AN EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS LEFT ME WITH A PROFOUND SYMPATHY FOR THE MANY GIFTED AND BRILLIANT MEN WHO ARE COMPELLED TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN THE MOST DREARY THE MOST THANKLESS AND THE WORST PAID PROFESSION IN THE WORLD
TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
HE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOW
LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
AND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISE
THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
AFTER THIS NO NEW IDEAS CAN BE IMPARTED TO HIM FROM THIS TIME AND SINCE MY MARRIAGE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THIS PERIOD I HAVE BELONGED TO THE STAFF OF MC GILL UNIVERSITY FIRST AS LECTURER IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LATER AS HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
YOU MAY FIND THEM ALL THE WAY FROM LAKE SUPERIOR TO THE SEA WITH THE SAME SQUARE STREETS AND THE SAME MAPLE TREES AND THE SAME CHURCHES AND HOTELS AND EVERYWHERE THE SUNSHINE OF THE LAND OF HOPE SIMILARLY THE REVEREND MISTER DRONE IS NOT ONE PERSON BUT ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN
I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
IN OTHER WORDS I WAS WHAT IS CALLED A DISTINGUISHED GRADUATE AND AS SUCH I TOOK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AS THE ONLY TRADE I COULD FIND THAT NEED NEITHER EXPERIENCE NOR INTELLECT I SPENT MY TIME FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE TO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON THE STAFF OF UPPER CANADA COLLEGE
ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
MY PARENTS MIGRATED TO CANADA IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I DECIDED TO GO WITH THEM MY FATHER TOOK UP A FARM NEAR LAKE SIMCOE IN ONTARIO THIS WAS DURING THE HARD TIMES OF CANADIAN FARMING
THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT ALL ROUND THE BRITISH EMPIRE DELIVERING ADDRESSES ON IMPERIAL ORGANIZATION WHEN I STATE THAT THESE LECTURES WERE FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA THE BANANA RIOTS IN TRINIDAD AND THE TURCO ITALIAN WAR
NOR TO CONSTRUCT EVEN THE SMALLEST SECTION OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY THIS HOWEVER IS A FORM OF NATIONAL INGRATITUDE TO WHICH ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED IN THIS DOMINION APART FROM MY COLLEGE WORK I HAVE WRITTEN TWO BOOKS ONE CALLED LITERARY LAPSES
THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
TO MAKE HIM I CLAPPED THE GAITERS OF ONE ECCLESIASTIC ROUND THE LEGS OF ANOTHER ADDED THE SERMONS OF A THIRD AND THE CHARACTER OF A FOURTH AND SO LET HIM START ON HIS WAY IN THE BOOK TO PICK UP SUCH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES AS HE MIGHT FIND FOR HIMSELF
I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
THEY GIVE IT AWAY AND WHO DO THEY GIVE IT TO WHY TO THOSE AS DON'T WANT IT EVERY TIME THEY GIVE IT TO THESE PROFESSORS AND TO THIS RESEARCH AND THAT AND DO THE POOR GET ANY OF IT NOT A CENT AND NEVER WILL I TELL YOU BOYS CONTINUED JEFF
WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
AND THE OTHER NONSENSE NOVELS EACH OF THESE IS PUBLISHED BY JOHN LANE LONDON AND NEW YORK AND EITHER OF THEM CAN BE OBTAINED ABSURD THOUGH IT SOUNDS FOR THE MERE SUM OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE ANY READER OF THIS PREFACE FOR EXAMPLE RIDICULOUS THOUGH IT APPEARS
THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
AND MY FATHER WAS JUST ABLE BY GREAT DILIGENCE TO PAY THE HIRED MEN AND IN YEARS OF PLENTY TO RAISE ENOUGH GRAIN TO HAVE SEED FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S CROP WITHOUT BUYING ANY BY THIS PROCESS MY BROTHERS AND I WERE INEVITABLY DRIVEN OFF THE LAND
AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
EXACTLY THE KIND OF A HEAD A MAN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE A HAUL OR A CLEAN UP IT WAS EVIDENTLY SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE HEAD AND AS FAR AS ONE COULD JUDGE JEFF'S OWN WAS THE VERY TYPE REQUIRED I DON'T KNOW JUST AT WHAT TIME OR HOW JEFFERSON FIRST BEGAN HIS SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISES
THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WRITE THESE HUMOROUS NOTHINGS IN IDLE MOMENTS WHEN THE WEARIED BRAIN IS UNABLE TO PERFORM THE SERIOUS LABOURS OF THE ECONOMIST MY OWN EXPERIENCE IS EXACTLY THE OTHER WAY
AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
WHILE I AM ABLE TO MIX WITH THE POORER OF THE BUSINESS MEN OF THE CITY ON TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE EQUALITY IN POINT OF LEISURE I ENJOY MORE IN THE FOUR CORNERS OF A SINGLE YEAR THAN A BUSINESS MAN KNOWS IN HIS WHOLE LIFE I THUS HAVE WHAT THE BUSINESS MAN CAN NEVER ENJOY
I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY TO BE A NECESSARY AND UNIVERSAL ADJUNCT OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BOOK
THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
SHE BEGAN TO HATE EVERY ONE ABOUT HER SHE HAD LONG SHARED THE UNIVERSAL VENERATION FOR FATHER MADELEINE YET BY DINT OF REPEATING TO HERSELF THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD DISCHARGED HER THAT HE WAS THE CAUSE OF HER UNHAPPINESS SHE CAME TO HATE HIM ALSO AND MOST OF ALL
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY RAW MATERIAL FOR POEMS ASKED SIR WALTER WITH A FROWN PEN INK AND PAPER WHAT ELSE SAID DEMOSTHENES DOESN'T IT TAKE BRAINS TO WRITE A POEM SAID RALEIGH
I THOUGHT HOUSE COMMITTEES WERE NOT EXPECTED TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO COMPLAINTS IN COMPLAINT BOOKS I NEVER HEARD OF ITS BEING DONE BEFORE WELL I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE EITHER REPLIED DEMOSTHENES CHEWING THOUGHTFULLY ON THE PEBBLE
NOW I ASK YOU GENTLEMEN IF THESE THINGS ARE TO BE TOLERATED ARE THEY NOT RATHER TO BE REPREHENDED WHETHER I AM A CHINAMAN OR NOT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO THEN ASKED SIR WALTER RALEIGH A LITTLE NETTLED

THAT'S THEIR OWN AFFAIR WELL THEY'RE VERY WASTEFUL SAID DEMOSTHENES WE CAN MEET THAT EASILY ENOUGH OBSERVED CASSIUS FURNISH EACH WRITING TABLE WITH A SLATE I SHOULD THINK THEY'D BE PLEASED WITH THAT IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO RUB OUT THE WRONG WORD
UPON THE TOP OF WHICH STOOD A MAN DRESSED IN RED WHO WAS HOLDING FORTH HE WAS A QUACK DENTIST ON HIS ROUNDS WHO WAS OFFERING TO THE PUBLIC FULL SETS OF TEETH OPIATES POWDERS AND ELIXIRS
DOESN'T IT TAKE BRAINS TO MAKE A PAIR OF SHOES RETORTED DEMOSTHENES SWALLOWING A PEBBLE IN HIS HASTE THEY'VE GOT A RIGHT TO THE STATIONERY THOUGH PUT IN BLACKSTONE A CLEAR LEGAL RIGHT TO IT
THE FIDDLING EX EMPEROR NERO SAID BACON LOUDLY ENOUGH TO BE HEARD ALL ABOUT THE ROOM IS MISTAKEN WHEN HE ATTRIBUTES OTHELLO TO ME AHA MASTER NERO CRIED SHAKESPEARE TRIUMPHANTLY WHAT DID I TELL YOU
NOT ONE SAID SHAKESPEARE I WAS MIGHTY GLAD THAT NIGHT THAT WE WERE AN IMMORTAL BAND IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO KILL US WE'D HAVE DIED THEN AND THERE THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID NERO WITH A SIGNIFICANT SHAKE OF HIS HEAD
PULL OUT MY TWO FRONT TEETH WHY I SHOULD BE HORRIBLE MY HAIR WILL GROW AGAIN BUT MY TEETH AH WHAT A MONSTER OF A MAN I SHOULD PREFER TO THROW MYSELF HEAD FIRST ON THE PAVEMENT FROM THE FIFTH STORY
RETORTED DOCTOR JOHNSON WITH SOME ASPERITY OF COURSE COMPLAINT BOOKS ARE FOR THE RECEPTION OF COMPLAINTS NOBODY DISPUTES THAT
WE DO NOT BIND OURSELVES TO YIELD TO DOCTORS AND LAWYERS AND SHOEMAKERS AND PLUMBERS IN CASE THEY SHOULD EACH WANT A CORNER TO THEMSELVES A VERY WISE IDEA SAID SIR WALTER WHEREUPON THE RESOLUTION WAS SUITABLY WORDED AND PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
AND SHAKESPEARE KNOWS IT OTHERS KNOW IT AH HERE COMES SIR WALTER RALEIGH WE'LL LEAVE IT TO HIM HE WAS COGNIZANT OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR I LEAVE IT TO NOBODY SAID SHAKESPEARE SULKILY WHAT'S THE TROUBLE ASKED RALEIGH
TO SAY THAT THIS MAN SHALL NOT ENTER BECAUSE HE IS THIS OR THAT OR THE OTHER THING WOULD RESULT IN OUR ULTIMATELY BECOMING A CLASS ORGANIZATION WHICH AS CONFUCIUS HIMSELF SAYS WE ARE NOT AND MUST NOT BE
I WENT OVER TO BOSTON ONE NIGHT LAST WEEK AND UNKNOWN TO ANYBODY I WAYLAID A FELLOW WHO WAS TO PLAY HAMLET THAT NIGHT I DRUGGED HIM AND WENT TO THE THEATRE AND PLAYED THE PART MYSELF IT WAS THE COLDEST HOUSE YOU EVER SAW IN YOUR LIFE
WROTE TO HER CONSTANTLY LETTERS WHOSE CONTENTS DROVE HER TO DESPAIR AND WHOSE CARRIAGE RUINED HER ONE DAY THEY WROTE TO HER THAT HER LITTLE COSETTE WAS ENTIRELY NAKED IN THAT COLD WEATHER THAT SHE NEEDED A WOOLLEN SKIRT
NO PERSONALITIES PLEASE DOCTOR SAID SIR WALTER RALEIGH THE CHAIRMAN RAPPING THE TABLE VIGOROUSLY WITH THE SHADE OF A HANDSOME GAVEL THAT HAD ONCE ADORNED THE ROMAN SENATE CHAMBER
PUGILISTS CLUBS ARE GOOD SO ARE ALL OTHER CLASS CLUBS BUT SO ALSO ARE CLUBS LIKE OUR OWN WHICH TAKES IN ALL WHO ARE WORTHY
AND WHAT WAS THE FIRST SIGHT THAT GREETED OUR EYES I GIVE IT UP SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON IT MUST HAVE BEEN A CATACORNERED SIGHT WHATEVER IT WAS IF THE EMPEROR'S EYES SLANTED LIKE YOURS
FANTINE MINGLED IN THE GROUP AND BEGAN TO LAUGH WITH THE REST AT THE HARANGUE WHICH CONTAINED SLANG FOR THE POPULACE AND JARGON FOR RESPECTABLE PEOPLE
LORD THE CANDLE IS ALL BURNED OUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THEN SHE LOOKED AT FANTINE
THEY DEMAND FORTY FRANCS OF ME SO MUCH FOR YOU YOU PEASANTS
FANTINE RETURNED HOME SHE WAS FURIOUS AND RELATED THE OCCURRENCE TO HER GOOD NEIGHBOR MARGUERITE CAN YOU UNDERSTAND SUCH A THING IS HE NOT AN ABOMINABLE MAN HOW CAN THEY ALLOW SUCH PEOPLE TO GO ABOUT THE COUNTRY
IT SHOWED IN SHAKESPEARE'S ESTIMATION HIS ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE OF THOSE DULL PERSONS WHO SUPPOSED THAT IN THEM WAS CENTRED THE DESTINY OF ALL MANKIND THE FATES HOWEVER ONLY SMILED AT THESE LITTLE ACTS OF REBELLION
SO THAT UNWITTINGLY THE GREAT DRAMATIST DID THEIR WILL AFTER ALL IT WAS A PART OF THEIR PLAN THAT UPON THIS OCCASION SHAKESPEARE SHOULD PLAY POOL WITH DOCTOR JOHNSON AND THE EMPEROR NERO
PRETTY GOOD RETURNED THE DOCTOR BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF KILLING OFF YOUR AUDIENCE THAT WAY IT'S BETTER BUSINESS TO LET EM LIVE I SAY SUPPOSE NERO GAVE A LONDON AUDIENCE THAT LITTLE MUSICALE HE PROVIDED AT QUEEN ELIZABETH'S WEDNESDAY NIGHT
THOUGH I CAN'T SAY I THINK YOUR PARALLELS ARE VERY PARALLEL A SHOEMAKER MY DEAR CONFUCIUS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM A POET CERTAINLY SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON VERY DIFFERENT IN FACT DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO MAKE A CONUNDRUM OF THE QUESTION
IF WE PUT OUT THE POET TO PLEASE THE SAGE WE'LL SOON HAVE TO PUT OUT THE SAGE TO PLEASE THE FOOL AND SO ON WE'LL KEEP IT UP ONCE THE PRECEDENT IS ESTABLISHED
WE MUST STICK TO OUR ORIGINAL IDEA THEN LET US DO SOMETHING TO ABATE THE NUISANCE OF WHICH I COMPLAIN SAID CONFUCIUS CAN'T WE ADOPT A HOUSE RULE
OH BUT NOT MUCH OF ONE SIR WALTER PUT IN DOCTOR JOHNSON DEPRECATINGLY NO SAID CONFUCIUS I DON'T WANT THEM EXCLUDED BUT THEY SHOULD BE CONTROLLED YOU DON'T LET A SHOEMAKER WHO HAS BECOME A MEMBER OF THIS CLUB
GOOD SHOT SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON NONCHALANTLY
HULLO WILLIAM SAID THE DOCTOR POCKETING THREE BALLS ON THE BREAK HOW'S OUR LITTLE SWANLET OF AVON THIS AFTERNOON WORN OUT SHAKESPEARE REPLIED I'VE BEEN HARD AT WORK ON A PLAY THIS MORNING AND I'M TIRED
THEN I ERRED THAT IS ALL SAID NERO AND I APOLOGIZE BUT REALLY MY LORD HE ADDED ADDRESSING BACON I FANCIED I DETECTED YOUR FINE ITALIAN HAND IN THAT NO I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OTHELLO SAID BACON
SHAKESPEARE WAS MY STENOGRAPHER GENTLEMEN SAID LORD BACON IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH HE DID WRITE HAMLET LITERALLY BUT IT WAS AT MY DICTATION I DENY IT SAID SHAKESPEARE
AND IF THE CORNER WE SELECT BE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE OTHER CORNERS OF THE CLUB THE SQUEAKING OF THE SLATE PENCILS NEED BOTHER NO ONE I AGREE TO THAT SAID BLACKSTONE ONLY I THINK IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THAT IN GRANTING THE PETITION OF THE POETS
I AS A POET WOULD NOT OBJECT TO THAT I DO ALL MY WORK AT HOME ANYHOW THERE'S ANOTHER PHASE OF THIS BUSINESS THAT WE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED YET AND IT'S RATHER IMPORTANT SAID DEMOSTHENES
TURN THE LIBRARY SOFAS INTO BENCHES AND GO PEGGING AWAY AT BOOT MAKING SO WHY SHOULD YOU LET THE POETS TURN THE PLACE INTO A VERSE FACTORY THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN SAID BLACKSTONE
CRIED MARGUERITE WHY IT IS A FORTUNE
AND IN VIEW OF THE AGE OF THE COMPLAINANTS I THINK WE CANNOT WELL DECLINE TO GIVE THEM A SPECIFIC ANSWER RESPECT FOR AGE IS DE RIGUEUR AT ALL TIMES LIKE CLEAN HANDS I'LL SECOND THE MOTION
FANTINE FLED AND STOPPED HER EARS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HEAR THE HOARSE VOICE OF THE MAN SHOUTING TO HER REFLECT MY BEAUTY TWO NAPOLEONS THEY MAY PROVE OF SERVICE
OUT OF BRAVADO AND WITH RAGE IN HER HEART HE WAS A MISERABLE SCAMP A SORT OF MENDICANT MUSICIAN A LAZY BEGGAR WHO BEAT HER AND WHO ABANDONED HER AS SHE HAD TAKEN HIM IN DISGUST SHE ADORED HER CHILD
WHICH REDUCED THE DAILY EARNINGS OF WORKING WOMEN TO NINE SOUS SEVENTEEN HOURS OF TOIL AND NINE SOUS A DAY HER CREDITORS WERE MORE PITILESS THAN EVER THE SECOND HAND DEALER
I DO NOT SMOKE I CAN'T PLAY BILLIARDS AND I DO NOT KNOW A TREY OF DIAMONDS FROM A SILVER SALVER ALL I CAN DO IS WRITE POETRY WHY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ME BY ALL MEANS LET US HAVE A POETS CORNER WHERE A MAN CAN BE INSPIRED IN PEACE
A PLUMBERS CLUB FOR INSTANCE AND HOW ABSURD THAT WOULD BE IN HADES NO GENTLEMEN IT CAN'T BE DONE THE POETS MUST AND SHALL BE PRESERVED WHAT'S THE OBJECTION TO CLASS CLUBS ANYHOW ASKED CASSIUS I DON'T OBJECT TO THEM
IT WAS THE MONEY THAT THEY WANTED THEY GAVE THE PETTICOAT TO EPONINE THE POOR LARK CONTINUED TO SHIVER FANTINE THOUGHT MY CHILD IS NO LONGER COLD I HAVE CLOTHED HER WITH MY HAIR
OTHERWISE HE WOULD TURN LITTLE COSETTE OUT OF DOORS CONVALESCENT AS SHE WAS FROM HER HEAVY ILLNESS INTO THE COLD AND THE STREETS AND THAT SHE MIGHT DO WHAT SHE LIKED WITH HERSELF AND DIE IF SHE CHOSE
SHE AFFECTED TO LAUGH AND SING AN OLD WORKWOMAN WHO ONCE SAW HER LAUGHING AND SINGING IN THIS FASHION SAID THERE'S A GIRL WHO WILL COME TO A BAD END SHE TOOK A LOVER THE FIRST WHO OFFERED A MAN WHOM SHE DID NOT LOVE
THAT'S IN THE MATTER OF STATIONERY THIS CLUB LIKE ALL OTHER WELL REGULATED CLUBS PROVIDES ITS MEMBERS WITH A SUITABLE SUPPLY OF WRITING MATERIALS
NO SAID THE SHADE OF EMERSON WHICH HAD STROLLED IN WHILE SHAKESPEARE WAS TALKING THAT ISN'T CRITICISM THAT'S BOSTON WHO DISCOVERED BOSTON ANYHOW ASKED DOCTOR JOHNSON IT WASN'T COLUMBUS WAS IT
SHAKESPEARE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND TOSSED UP AN OBOLUS HEADS BACON TAILS POOL WITH NERO AND JOHNSON HE SAID THE COIN CAME DOWN WITH HEADS UP AND SHAKESPEARE WENT INTO THE POOL ROOM
COSETTE IS ILL WITH A MALADY WHICH IS GOING THE ROUNDS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD A MILIARY FEVER THEY CALL IT EXPENSIVE DRUGS ARE REQUIRED THIS IS RUINING US AND WE CAN NO LONGER PAY FOR THEM
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN MARGUERITE ENTERED FANTINE'S ROOM BEFORE DAYLIGHT FOR THEY ALWAYS WORKED TOGETHER AND IN THIS MANNER USED ONLY ONE CANDLE FOR THE TWO SHE FOUND FANTINE SEATED ON HER BED PALE AND FROZEN
SAID EMERSON SPELT WITH A P I SUPPOSE SAID SHAKESPEARE P S H A W PSHAW M U T MUT PSHAWMUT SO CALLED BECAUSE THE INHABITANTS ARE ALWAYS MUTTERING PSHAW EH PRETTY GOOD SAID JOHNSON
HA HA IT WAS THE GREATEST JOKE OF THE CENTURY WELL THE LAUGH IS ON YOU SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON IF YOU WROTE HAMLET AND DIDN'T HAVE THE SENSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT
ARE THE FRONT TEETH THE TWO UPPER ONES HOW HORRIBLE EXCLAIMED FANTINE TWO NAPOLEONS GRUMBLED A TOOTHLESS OLD WOMAN WHO WAS PRESENT
HE'S ONLY A CHINAMAN MUTTERED JOHNSON WHAT WAS THE SIGHT THAT GREETED YOUR EYES CONFUCIUS ASKED CASSIUS OMAR KHAYYAM STRETCHED OVER FIVE OF THE MOST COMFORTABLE CHAIRS IN THE LIBRARY RETURNED CONFUCIUS
SAID TO HER INCESSANTLY WHEN WILL YOU PAY ME YOU HUSSY WHAT DID THEY WANT OF HER GOOD GOD SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS BEING HUNTED AND SOMETHING OF THE WILD BEAST DEVELOPED IN HER ABOUT THE SAME TIME THENARDIER WROTE TO HER THAT HE HAD WAITED WITH DECIDEDLY TOO MUCH AMIABILITY
SHE RECEIVED THE LETTER AND CRUSHED IT IN HER HANDS ALL DAY LONG THAT EVENING SHE WENT INTO A BARBER'S SHOP AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND PULLED OUT HER COMB HER ADMIRABLE GOLDEN HAIR FELL TO HER KNEES
CHARON INFORMS ME THAT THE WASTE BASKETS LAST WEEK TURNED OUT FORTY TWO REAMS OF OUR BEST CORRESPONDENCE PAPER ON WHICH THESE POETS HAD SCRIBBLED THE FIRST DRAFT OF THEIR VERSES
MY CHILD WILL NOT DIE OF THAT FRIGHTFUL MALADY FOR LACK OF SUCCOR I AM CONTENT SO SAYING SHE POINTED OUT TO THE SPINSTER TWO NAPOLEONS WHICH WERE GLITTERING ON THE TABLE AH JESUS GOD
WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY ATTRIBUTING THOSE WORDS TO BACON DEMANDED SHAKESPEARE GETTING RED IN THE FACE OH COME NOW WILLIAM REMONSTRATED NERO
AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE VINGT ET UN AND OTHER PLAYERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM THE WOOERS OF THE MUSE I'LL VOTE TO HAVE THE POETS CORNER AND IN IT I MOVE THAT CASSIUS'S SLATE IDEA BE CARRIED OUT IT WILL BE A GREAT SAVING
FAVORABLE ASKED THE DOCTOR THEY ALL DISMISSED ME WITH A LINE SAID THE DRAMATIST SAID MY CONCEPTION OF THE PART WAS NOT SHAKESPEARIAN AND THAT'S CRITICISM
I THINK THE POETS CORNER ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY SAID CONFUCIUS THIS ISN'T A CLASS ORGANIZATION AND WE SHOULD RESIST ANY EFFORT TO MAKE IT OR ANY PORTION OF IT SO
AND IT WAS COMMON GOSSIP IN EREBUS THAT ONE OF THE TRIO HAD TOLD THE FURIES THAT THEY HAD OBSERVED SHAKESPEARE'S TENDENCY TO KICK OVER THE TRACES AND ALWAYS ACTED ACCORDINGLY THEY NEVER LET THE COIN FALL SO AS TO DECIDE A QUESTION THE WAY THEY WANTED IT
AND SHE HAD A BLACK HOLE IN HER MOUTH THE TWO TEETH HAD BEEN EXTRACTED
I DO NOT KNOW THAT I APPROVE OF THE SUGGESTION MYSELF BUT IN ORDER TO BRING IT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR DEBATE I AM WILLING TO MAKE A MOTION THAT THE REQUEST BE GRANTED EXCUSE ME PUT IN DOCTOR JOHNSON
AND DOCTOR JOHNSON IS DOWN IN THE BILLIARD ROOM PLAYING POOL WITH NERO HA HA LAUGHED SHAKESPEARE POOL EH DOES NERO PLAY POOL NOT AS WELL AS HE DOES THE FIDDLE SIR SAID THE JANITOR WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE
THE LITTLE ONE WILL BE DEAD SHE BURST OUT LAUGHING AND SAID TO HER OLD NEIGHBOR
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL TEETH YOU GIRL THERE WHO ARE LAUGHING IF YOU WANT TO SELL ME YOUR PALETTES I WILL GIVE YOU A GOLD NAPOLEON APIECE FOR THEM WHAT ARE MY PALETTES ASKED FANTINE THE PALETTES REPLIED THE DENTAL PROFESSOR
AND WHAT DID HE OFFER ASKED MARGUERITE TWO NAPOLEONS
I GOT THEM REPLIED FANTINE AT THE SAME TIME SHE SMILED THE CANDLE ILLUMINATED HER COUNTENANCE IT WAS A BLOODY SMILE A REDDISH SALIVA SOILED THE CORNERS OF HER LIPS
IF WE COULD HAVE HAD POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS IN MY DAY I MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD TO FALL ON MY SWORD TO GET OUT OF KEEPING AN ENGAGEMENT I HAD NO FANCY FOR CLASS CLUBS HAVE THEIR USES NO DOUBT SAID DEMOSTHENES
IN ALL THE CLUBS I HAVE KNOWN THE HOUSE COMMITTEES HAVE INVARIABLY TAKEN THE GROUND THAT THE COMPLAINT BOOK WAS ESTABLISHED TO GUARD THEM AGAINST THE ANNOYANCE OF HEARING COMPLAINTS THIS ONE HOWEVER HAS BEEN FORCED UPON US BY OUR SECRETARY
SHE HAD LOST HER SHAME SHE LOST HER COQUETRY A FINAL SIGN SHE WENT OUT WITH DIRTY CAPS WHETHER FROM LACK OF TIME OR FROM INDIFFERENCE SHE NO LONGER MENDED HER LINEN AS THE HEELS WORE OUT SHE DRAGGED HER STOCKINGS DOWN INTO HER SHOES
YOU PRESENT TO MY MIND A CLOSER RESEMBLANCE TO SIMPLE SIMON THAN TO SOCRATES FOR MY PART I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DID WRITE IT AND I DO BELIEVE THAT SHAKESPEARE DID I CAN TELL THAT BY THE SPELLING IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION
FOR FOUR DAYS THIS ENTRY LAY IN THE BOOK APPARENTLY UNNOTICED
I BELIEVE IT WAS ONE OF HIS FIDDLINGS THAT SENT NATURE INTO CONVULSIONS AND CAUSED THE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII SO THERE PUT THAT ON YOUR MUSIC RACK AND FIDDLE IT MY LITTLE EMPEROR NERO'S FACE GREW PURPLE WITH ANGER
I ADMIT YOU GAVE ME A SUGGESTION NOW AND THEN SO AS TO KEEP IT DULL AND HEAVY IN SPOTS SO THAT IT WOULD SEEM MORE LIKE A REAL TRAGEDY THAN A COMEDY PUNCTUATED WITH DEATHS BUT BEYOND THAT YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT I SIDE WITH SHAKESPEARE PUT IN EMERSON
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SHOEMAKER AND A POET ONE MAKES THE SHOES AND THE OTHER SHAKES THE MUSE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD STILL I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN EXCLUDE THE POETS IT IS THE VERY DEMOCRACY OF THIS CLUB THAT GIVES IT LIFE WE TAKE IN EVERYBODY
AND THERE STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH ON THE POOL TABLE WAS ROBERT BURNS TRYING TO WRITE A SONNET ON THE CLOTH WITH CHALK IN LESS TIME THAN VILLON COULD TURN OUT ANOTHER WITH TWO LINES START ON THE BILLIARD TABLE WITH THE SAME WRITING MATERIALS
NO NOONDAY THE EVENING JOINING ON TO THE MORNING FOGS TWILIGHT THE WINDOW IS GRAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE CLEARLY AT IT THE SKY IS BUT A VENT HOLE THE WHOLE DAY IS A CAVERN THE SUN HAS THE AIR OF A BEGGAR
FANTINE HAD GROWN TEN YEARS OLDER SINCE THE PRECEDING NIGHT JESUS SAID MARGUERITE WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU FANTINE NOTHING REPLIED FANTINE QUITE THE CONTRARY
ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY SAID NERO GRINNING BROADLY YOU ARE A BRIGHT SPIRIT SAID SHAKESPEARE WITH A SIGH I WISH I HAD THOUGHT TO WORK YOU UP INTO A TRAGEDY I'VE OFTEN WONDERED WHY YOU DIDN'T
LORD BACON ACCOMPANIED BY CHARON AND THE ICE FOR NERO AND THE ALE FOR DOCTOR JOHNSON APPEARED AS SHAKESPEARE SPOKE THE PHILOSOPHER BOWED STIFFLY AT DOCTOR JOHNSON AS THOUGH HE HARDLY APPROVED OF HIM EXTENDED HIS LEFT HAND TO SHAKESPEARE
MOST POETS PREFER TO RUB OUT THE RIGHT WORD GROWLED CONFUCIUS BESIDES I SHALL NEVER CONSENT TO SLATES IN THIS HOUSE BOAT THE SQUEAKING OF THE PENCILS WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE POEMS THEMSELVES THAT'S TRUE
THEN SHE DESCENDED THE STAIRS AND EMERGED RUNNING AND LEAPING AND STILL LAUGHING SOME ONE MET HER AND SAID TO HER WHAT MAKES YOU SO GAY SHE REPLIED
JUST TO SHOW THE FATES THAT HE DIDN'T CARE A TUPPENCE FOR THEIR VERDICT AS REGISTERED THROUGH THE OBOLUS IT WAS A PECULIAR CUSTOM OF SHAKESPEARE'S TO TOSS UP A COIN TO DECIDE QUESTIONS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE AND THEN DO THE THING THE COIN DECIDED HE SHOULD NOT DO
POETS CLUBS ARE A GOOD THING
SHE FOUND THEM IN THE STREET SHE FOUND THEM AGAIN ON HER STAIRCASE SHE PASSED MANY A NIGHT WEEPING AND THINKING HER EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT AND SHE FELT A STEADY PAIN IN HER SHOULDER TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE LEFT SHOULDER BLADE SHE COUGHED A GREAT DEAL
SHE PUT ON LITTLE ROUND CAPS WHICH CONCEALED HER SHORN HEAD AND IN WHICH SHE WAS STILL PRETTY DARK THOUGHTS HELD POSSESSION OF FANTINE'S HEART WHEN SHE SAW THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER DRESS HER HAIR
ONE OF THOSE ATTICS WHOSE EXTREMITY FORMS AN ANGLE WITH THE FLOOR AND KNOCKS YOU ON THE HEAD EVERY INSTANT THE POOR OCCUPANT CAN REACH THE END OF HIS CHAMBER AS HE CAN THE END OF HIS DESTINY ONLY BY BENDING OVER MORE AND MORE SHE HAD NO LONGER A BED
WHAT NONSENSE SAID BACON THE ONLY PLAYS OF YOURS I WROTE WERE HAM SH SAID SHAKESPEARE SHAKING HIS HEAD MADLY HUSH NOBODY'S SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT THIS IS PURELY A DISCUSSION OF OTHELLO
SHE REMAINED THOUGHTFUL AND BEGAN HER WORK AT THE EXPIRATION OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE LEFT HER SEWING
THOUGHT FANTINE BUT IN WHAT TRADE CAN ONE EARN A HUNDRED SOUS A DAY COME SAID SHE LET US SELL WHAT IS LEFT
SHE HAD NOT LAIN DOWN HER CAP HAD FALLEN ON HER KNEES HER CANDLE HAD BURNED ALL NIGHT AND WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONSUMED MARGUERITE HALTED ON THE THRESHOLD PETRIFIED AT THIS TREMENDOUS WASTEFULNESS AND EXCLAIMED
WELL SAID BACON SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AS THOUGH THE RESULTS OF THE CONTROVERSY WERE IMMATERIAL TO HIM HAVE IT SO IF YOU PLEASE THERE ISN'T ANY MONEY IN SHAKESPEARE THESE DAYS SO WHAT'S THE USE OF QUARRELLING I WROTE HAMLET
AND SAMSON WAS WISE IN BACKING IT UP THE POETS NEED TO BE CONCENTRATED SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WILL NOT BE A NUISANCE TO OTHER PEOPLE AND WHERE OTHER PEOPLE WILL NOT BE A NUISANCE TO THEM HOMER OUGHT TO HAVE A PLACE TO COMPOSE IN WHERE THE VINGT ET UN PLAYERS WILL NOT INTERRUPT HIS FRENZIES
I WISH I'D SAID THAT WELL TELL BOSWELL SAID SHAKESPEARE
BUT I SUPPOSE COMPLAINT BOOKS ARE THE PLACES FOR COMPLAINTS YOU DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO WRITE SERIAL STORIES OR DIALECT POEMS IN THEM DO YOU THAT ISN'T THE POINT AS THE MAN SAID TO THE ASSASSIN WHO TRIED TO STAB HIM WITH THE HILT OF HIS DAGGER
SHE DEEPLY HATED FATHER MADELEINE BUT MADE NO COMPLAINT SHE SEWED SEVENTEEN HOURS A DAY BUT A CONTRACTOR FOR THE WORK OF PRISONS WHO MADE THE PRISONERS WORK AT A DISCOUNT SUDDENLY MADE PRICES FALL
WE ALL KNOW WILL AND HIS DROLL WAYS NO DOUBT PUT IN NERO BUT THE QUESTION OF HAMLET ALWAYS EXCITES HIM SO THAT WE'D LIKE TO HAVE IT SETTLED ONCE AND FOR ALL AS TO WHO WROTE IT BACON SAYS YOU KNOW
THE LOWER SHE DESCENDED THE DARKER EVERYTHING GREW ABOUT HER THE MORE RADIANT SHONE THAT LITTLE ANGEL AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART SHE SAID WHEN I GET RICH I WILL HAVE MY COSETTE WITH ME AND SHE LAUGHED
AND IT RELUCTANTLY TOOK THE SUBJECT IN HAND AT AN EARLY MEETING I FIND HERE SAID DEMOSTHENES TO THE CHAIRMAN AS THE COMMITTEE GATHERED A SUGGESTION FROM HOMER AND SAMSON THAT THIS HOUSE BOAT BE PROVIDED WITH A POETS CORNER
AND STARED COLDLY AT NERO DID YOU SEND FOR ME WILLIAM HE ASKED LANGUIDLY I DID SAID SHAKESPEARE
THAT POETS MUST NOT BE INSPIRED BETWEEN THE HOURS OF ELEVEN A M AND FIVE P M OR IN THE EVENING AFTER EIGHT THAT ANY POET DISCOVERED USING MORE THAN FIVE ARM CHAIRS IN THE COMPOSITION OF A QUATRAIN WILL BE CHARGED TWO OBOLI AN HOUR FOR EACH CHAIR IN EXCESS OF THAT NUMBER
IT'S ALL RIGHT TO PULL THE WOOL OVER THE EYES OF THE MORTALS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THERE FOR BUT AS FOR US WE'RE ALL IN THE SECRET HERE WHAT'S THE USE OF PUTTING ON NONSENSE WITH US WE'LL SEE IN A MINUTE WHAT THE USE IS RETORTED THE AVONIAN WE'LL HAVE BACON DOWN HERE
COSETTE WAS NOT ILL FANTINE THREW HER MIRROR OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE HAD LONG SINCE QUITTED HER CELL ON THE SECOND FLOOR FOR AN ATTIC WITH ONLY A LATCH TO FASTEN IT
AND THAT THE BILLIARD MARKER SHALL BE REQUIRED TO CHARGE A PREMIUM OF THREE TIMES THE ORDINARY FEE FOR TABLES USED BY VERSIFIERS IN LIEU OF WRITING PADS THAT WOULDN'T BE A BAD IDEA SAID SIR WALTER RALEIGH
CHAPTER TEN RESULT OF THE SUCCESS SHE HAD BEEN DISMISSED TOWARDS THE END OF THE WINTER THE SUMMER PASSED BUT WINTER CAME AGAIN SHORT DAYS LESS WORK WINTER NO WARMTH NO LIGHT
WHAT SPLENDID HAIR EXCLAIMED THE BARBER HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR IT SAID SHE
IT IS A MALADY THAT ONE GETS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW THEN IT ATTACKS CHILDREN CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR DO PEOPLE DIE OF IT THEY MAY SAID MARGUERITE
FANTINE LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT TO READ HER LETTER ONCE MORE ON THE STAIRCASE THAT EVENING SHE WENT OUT AND WAS SEEN TO TURN HER STEPS IN THE DIRECTION
THE IDEA THAT MAKES TWO NAPOLEONS WHERE DO THEY THINK I AM TO GET THEM THESE PEASANTS ARE STUPID TRULY NEVERTHELESS SHE WENT TO A DORMER WINDOW IN THE STAIRCASE AND READ THE LETTER ONCE MORE
SAID CASSIUS I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT IF A DOZEN POETS GOT TO WORK ON THOSE SLATES AT ONCE A FIFE CORPS WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEM WELL IT ALL GOES TO PROVE WHAT I HAVE THOUGHT ALL ALONG SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON HOMER'S IDEA IS A GOOD ONE
I'VE MURDERED EVERYTHING BUT ENGLISH THOUGH I COULD HAVE MADE A FINE TRAGEDY OUT OF YOU SAID SHAKESPEARE JUST THINK WHAT A DREADFUL CLIMAX FOR A TRAGEDY IT WOULD BE JOHNSON TO HAVE NERO AS THE CURTAIN FELL PLAYING A VIOLIN SOLO
A FRIGHTFUL SEASON WINTER CHANGES THE WATER OF HEAVEN AND THE HEART OF MAN INTO A STONE HER CREDITORS HARRASSED HER FANTINE EARNED TOO LITTLE HER DEBTS HAD INCREASED
AND WHEN I VENTURED TO REMONSTRATE WITH HIM HE LOST HIS TEMPER AND SAID I'D SPOILED THE WHOLE SECOND VOLUME OF THE RUBAIYAT I TOLD HIM HE OUGHT TO DO HIS RUBAIYATTING AT HOME AND HE MADE A SCENE TO AVOID WHICH I HASTENED WITH MY GUEST OVER TO THE BILLIARD ROOM
AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
THE PALL BEARERS WERE SENATORS BLAINE VORHEES DAVID DAVIS PADDOCK AND ALLISON COLONEL WARD H LAMON HON JEREMIAH WILSON OF INDIANA AND HON THOMAS A BOYD OF ILLINOIS
REASON THE ONLY TORCH JUSTICE THE ONLY WORSHIPER HUMANITY THE ONLY RELIGION AND LOVE THE PRIEST HE ADDED TO THE SUM OF HUMAN JOY
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
WHY SHOULD WE FEAR THAT WHICH WILL COME TO ALL THAT IS WE CANNOT TELL WE DO NOT KNOW WHICH IS THE GREATEST BLESSING LIFE OR DEATH
DIED WHERE MANHOOD'S MORNING ALMOST TOUCHES NOON AND WHILE THE SHADOWS STILL WERE FALLING TOWARD THE WEST HE HAD NOT PASSED ON LIFE'S HIGHWAY THE STONE THAT MARKS THE HIGHEST POINT
I THINK THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE FLAT AND DISAGREEABLE I PREFER TASSO A GOOD DEAL OR EVEN THE SOPORIFIC TALES OF ARIOSTO
THOSE WHO WERE SINCERE HAVE OWNED TO ME THAT THE POEM MADE THEM FALL ASLEEP YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY OR LIKE THOSE RUSTY MEDALS WHICH ARE NO LONGER OF USE IN COMMERCE
ALMOST OF JOY THERE IS FOR THEM THIS CONSOLATION THE DEAD DO NOT SUFFER IF THEY LIVE AGAIN THEIR LIVES WILL SURELY BE AS GOOD AS OURS WE HAVE NO FEAR
FOR MARTIN HE WAS FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT HE WOULD BE AS BADLY OFF ELSEWHERE AND THEREFORE BORE THINGS PATIENTLY
HE CONSULTED PANGLOSS MARTIN AND THE FAITHFUL CACAMBO
BUT HE COULD NOT DO IT AND FINALLY HE BOWED HIS HEAD UPON THE DEAD MAN'S COFFIN IN UNCONTROLLABLE GRIEF IT WAS AFTER SOME DELAY AND THE GREATEST EFFORTS OF SELF MASTERY THAT COLONEL INGERSOLL WAS ABLE TO FINISH READING HIS ADDRESS
AND IN A VOICE OF EXQUISITE CADENCE DELIVERED ONE OF HIS CHARACTERISTIC EULOGIES FOR THE DEAD
ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER
YOU MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY ONE ELSE EVER OPENS THEM MARTIN SAW SOME SHELVES FILLED WITH ENGLISH BOOKS
PAQUETTE CONTINUED HER TRADE WHEREVER SHE WENT BUT MADE NOTHING OF IT
YOU KNOW SIR WHAT A DANGEROUS THING IT IS FOR AN ILL NATURED WOMAN TO BE MARRIED TO A DOCTOR INCENSED AT THE BEHAVIOUR OF HIS WIFE
BUT IN ALL THESE VOLUMES THERE IS NOTHING BUT CHIMERICAL SYSTEMS AND NOT A SINGLE USEFUL THING AND WHAT DRAMATIC WORKS I SEE HERE SAID CANDIDE IN ITALIAN SPANISH AND FRENCH YES
BROKEN ONLY BY THE MOTHER'S SOBS UNTIL THE UNDERTAKER ADVANCED TOWARD A STOUT FLORID COMPLEXIONED GENTLEMAN IN THE PARTY AND WHISPERED TO HIM THE WORDS BEING INAUDIBLE TO THE LOOKERS ON
WHILE YET IN LOVE WITH LIFE AND RAPTURED WITH THE WORLD HE PASSED TO SILENCE AND PATHETIC DUST YET AFTER ALL IT MAY BE BEST
AND YET THE BEAUTIFUL CUNEGONDE HAS NOT ARRIVED
THE GIRL BLUSHED THE THEATIN ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND SHE FOLLOWED HIM
FOR MY PART I HAVE LONG SINCE RENOUNCED THOSE PALTRY ENTERTAINMENTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE GLORY OF MODERN ITALY AND ARE PURCHASED SO DEARLY BY SOVEREIGNS
COLONEL INGERSOLL WAS UNPROTECTED BY EITHER HAT OR UMBRELLA
I KNOW OF NOTHING IN SO BAD A TASTE SAID THE MASTER ALL YOU SEE HERE IS MERELY TRIFLING AFTER TO MORROW I WILL HAVE IT PLANTED WITH A NOBLER DESIGN
FOR WHETHER IN MID SEA OR AMONG THE BREAKERS OF THE FARTHER SHORE A WRECK MUST MARK AT LAST THE END OF EACH AND ALL AND EVERY LIFE NO MATTER IF ITS EVERY HOUR IS RICH WITH LOVE
THEY INCLUDED DETECTIVE AND MISSUS GEORGE O MILLER AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO HAD GATHERED TO WITNESS THE BURIAL OF THE FORMER'S BRIGHT LITTLE SON HARRY AS THE CASKET RESTED UPON THE TRESTLES THERE WAS A PAINFUL PAUSE
AT LEAST YOU WILL ALLOW ME SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN THAT THESE TWO ARE HAPPY HITHERTO I HAVE MET WITH NONE BUT UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE HABITABLE GLOBE EXCEPT IN EL DORADO BUT AS TO THIS PAIR I WOULD VENTURE TO LAY A WAGER THAT THEY ARE VERY HAPPY I LAY YOU THEY ARE NOT SAID MARTIN
MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE
HE SIDED WITH THE WEAK AND WITH A WILLING HAND GAVE ALMS WITH LOYAL HEART AND WITH THE PUREST HAND HE FAITHFUL DISCHARGED ALL PUBLIC TRUSTS HE WAS A WORSHIPER OF LIBERTY
BUT BEING WEARY FOR A MOMENT HE LAY DOWN BY THE WAYSIDE AND USING HIS BURDEN FOR A PILLOW FELL INTO THAT DREAMLESS SLEEP THAT KISSES DOWN HIS EYELIDS STILL
THE LARGEST AND THE NOBLER FAITH IN ALL THAT IS AND IS TO BE TELLS US THAT DEATH EVEN AT ITS WORST IS ONLY PERFECT REST
IMMEDIATELY HE ACCOSTED THEM
OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
I SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH THE LIBERTY WHICH INSPIRES THE ENGLISH GENIUS IF PASSION AND PARTY SPIRIT DID NOT CORRUPT ALL THAT IS ESTIMABLE IN THIS PRECIOUS LIBERTY
TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES TO HAVE A BUTTOCK CUT OFF TO RUN THE GAUNTLET AMONG THE BULGARIANS TO BE WHIPPED AND HANGED AT AN AUTO DA FE
WHICH APPEARS SO PLEASANT TO YOU MEN WHILE TO US WOMEN IT IS THE UTMOST ABYSS OF MISERY I HAVE COME TO EXERCISE THE PROFESSION AT VENICE
YOU SEE THAT ALREADY I HAVE WON HALF THE WAGER FRIAR GIROFLEE STAYED IN THE DINING ROOM AND DRANK A GLASS OR TWO OF WINE WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR DINNER BUT SAID CANDIDE TO PAQUETTE YOU LOOKED SO GAY AND CONTENT WHEN I MET YOU
AND ALL MY FELLOWS ARE IN THE SAME CASE
MY PARENTS FORCED ME AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN TO PUT ON THIS DETESTABLE HABIT TO INCREASE THE FORTUNE OF A CURSED ELDER BROTHER WHOM GOD CONFOUND JEALOUSY DISCORD AND FURY DWELL IN THE CONVENT
THIS IS ONE OF THE MISERIES OF THE TRADE YESTERDAY I WAS ROBBED AND BEATEN BY AN OFFICER YET TO DAY I MUST PUT ON GOOD HUMOUR TO PLEASE A FRIAR CANDIDE WANTED NO MORE CONVINCING HE OWNED THAT MARTIN WAS IN THE RIGHT
IT IS TRUE I HAVE PREACHED A FEW BAD SERMONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ME IN A LITTLE MONEY OF WHICH THE PRIOR STOLE HALF WHILE THE REST SERVES TO MAINTAIN MY GIRLS
THERE ARE MAXIMS IN THIS WRITER ANSWERED POCOCURANTE FROM WHICH A MAN OF THE WORLD MAY REAP GREAT BENEFIT AND BEING WRITTEN IN ENERGETIC VERSE THEY ARE MORE EASILY IMPRESSED UPON THE MEMORY
THE GARDENS LAID OUT WITH TASTE WERE ADORNED WITH FINE MARBLE STATUES THE PALACE WAS BEAUTIFULLY BUILT
ARE TRUE OF ALL THE COUNTLESS DEAD AND NOW TO YOU WHO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FROM AMONG THE MANY MEN HE LOVED TO DO THE LAST SAD OFFICE FOR THE DEAD WE GIVE HIS SACRED DUST
AND THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME BUT TO DIE
THIS IS THE PRIVILEGE OF HUMANITY IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES DARE NOT ACQUIRE A SINGLE IDEA WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF A DOMINICAN FRIAR
LET THAT BE AS IT MAY SAID CANDIDE BUT ONE THING CONSOLES ME I SEE THAT WE OFTEN MEET WITH THOSE WHOM WE EXPECTED NEVER TO SEE MORE SO THAT PERHAPS AS I HAVE FOUND MY RED SHEEP AND PAQUETTE
BUT IN THE NIGHT OF DEATH HOPE SEES A STAR AND LISTENING LOVE CAN HEAR THE RUSTLE OF A WING HE WHO SLEEPS HERE WHEN DYING MISTAKING THE APPROACH OF DEATH FOR THE RETURN OF HEALTH
THE POOR BARBARIAN WEEPING ABOVE HIS DEAD CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION AS INTELLIGENTLY AND SATISFACTORILY AS THE ROBED PRIEST OF THE MOST AUTHENTIC CREED
BRIGHTENING AND SOBS BECOMING HUSHED THE COLONEL SAID MY FRIENDS I KNOW HOW VAIN IT IS TO GILD A GRIEF WITH WORDS AND YET I WISH TO TAKE FROM EVERY GRAVE ITS FEAR
HA HERE ARE FOUR SCORE VOLUMES OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES CRIED MARTIN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING VALUABLE IN THIS COLLECTION
THIS CATASTROPHE MADE A GREAT NOISE FOR SOME HOURS
HE CLIMBED THE HEIGHTS AND LEFT ALL SUPERSTITIONS FAR BELOW WHILE ON HIS FOREHEAD FELL THE GOLDEN DAWNING OF A GRANDER DAY HE LOVED THE BEAUTIFUL
I MAKE THEM LIE WITH ME SOMETIMES FOR I AM VERY TIRED OF THE LADIES OF THE TOWN OF THEIR COQUETRIES OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES
TO BE DISSECTED TO ROW IN THE GALLEYS IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE
NEITHER CAN WE TELL WHICH IS THE MORE FORTUNATE THE CHILD DYING IN ITS MOTHER'S ARMS BEFORE ITS LIPS HAVE LEARNED TO FORM A WORD
NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN IN ITALY COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN THOSE MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCES AND THE MARRIAGE OF SIN AND DEATH AND THE SNAKES BROUGHT FORTH BY SIN
WE CANNOT SAY THAT DEATH IS NOT GOOD WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE GRAVE IS THE END OF THIS LIFE OR THE DOOR OF ANOTHER OR WHETHER THE NIGHT HERE IS NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE A DAWN
TOOK PLACE AT HIS RESIDENCE IN WASHINGTON D C JUNE SECOND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE CEREMONIES WERE EXTREMELY SIMPLE CONSISTING MERELY OF VIEWING THE REMAINS BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS AND A FUNERAL ORATION BY COLONEL ROBERT G INGERSOLL
COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
FIRST TWO PRETTY GIRLS VERY NEATLY DRESSED SERVED THEM WITH CHOCOLATE WHICH WAS FROTHED EXCEEDINGLY WELL CANDIDE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM COMMENDING THEIR BEAUTY GRACE AND ADDRESS THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH CREATURES SAID THE SENATOR
AND A FRIEND OF THE OPPRESSED A THOUSAND TIMES I HAVE HEARD HIM QUOTE THE WORDS FOR JUSTICE ALL PLACE A TEMPLE AND ALL SEASON SUMMER HE BELIEVED THAT HAPPINESS WAS THE ONLY GOOD
AND THE SAME FATE AWAITS US ALL WE TOO HAVE OUR RELIGION AND IT IS THIS HELP FOR THE LIVING HOPE FOR THE DEAD
CANDIDE'S MELANCHOLY INCREASED AND MARTIN CONTINUED TO PROVE TO HIM THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE VIRTUE OR HAPPINESS UPON EARTH EXCEPT PERHAPS IN EL DORADO WHERE NOBODY COULD GAIN ADMITTANCE WHILE THEY WERE DISPUTING ON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT
BROTHER OF THE DECEASED A LARGE NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN WERE PRESENT INCLUDING SECRETARY SHERMAN ASSISTANT SECRETARY HAWLEY SENATORS BLAINE VORHEES PADDOCK ALLISON LOGAN
IF A FAMOUS SURGEON HAD NOT TAKEN COMPASSION ON ME I SHOULD HAVE DIED
I WISH SAID MARTIN SHE MAY ONE DAY MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY BUT I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH
THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
WELL SAID HE HAVE I NOT WON THE WHOLE WAGER
THIS BRAVE AND TENDER MAN IN EVERY STORM OF LIFE WAS OAK AND ROCK BUT IN THE SUNSHINE HE WAS VINE AND FLOWER HE WAS THE FRIEND OF ALL HEROIC SOULS
WHICH WAS AS FOLLOWS MY FRIENDS I AM GOING TO DO THAT WHICH THE DEAD OFTEN PROMISED HE WOULD DO FOR ME THE LOVED AND LOVING BROTHER HUSBAND FATHER FRIEND
REPLIED THE SENATOR THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND AND NOT THREE DOZEN OF THEM GOOD FOR ANYTHING AS TO THOSE COLLECTIONS OF SERMONS WHICH ALTOGETHER ARE NOT WORTH A SINGLE PAGE OF SENECA AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY
I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY
I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS OF CACAMBO
TO BE ROBBED BY ONE OF WHAT ONE HAS EARNED FROM ANOTHER TO BE SUBJECT TO THE EXTORTIONS OF THE OFFICERS OF JUSTICE AND TO HAVE IN PROSPECT ONLY A FRIGHTFUL OLD AGE A HOSPITAL AND A DUNG HILL
I HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE FRIGHTFUL DISASTERS THAT BEFELL THE FAMILY OF MY LADY BARONESS AND THE FAIR CUNEGONDE I SWEAR TO YOU THAT MY FATE HAS BEEN SCARCELY LESS SAD
THAT TROY SO LONG BESIEGED WITHOUT BEING TAKEN ALL THESE TOGETHER CAUSED ME GREAT WEARINESS I HAVE SOMETIMES ASKED LEARNED MEN WHETHER THEY WERE NOT AS WEARY AS I OF THAT WORK
HERE IN THIS WORLD WHERE LIFE AND DEATH ARE EQUAL KINGS ALL SHOULD BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO MEET WHAT ALL HAVE MET THE FUTURE HAS BEEN FILLED WITH FEAR STAINED AND POLLUTED BY THE HEARTLESS PAST
I GRANT SAID THE SENATOR THAT THE SECOND FOURTH AND SIXTH BOOKS OF HIS A ENEID ARE EXCELLENT
AND WHO WHILE MOSES REPRESENTS THE ETERNAL PRODUCING THE WORLD BY A WORD MAKES THE MESSIAH TAKE A GREAT PAIR OF COMPASSES FROM THE ARMOURY OF HEAVEN TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS WORK HOW CAN I HAVE ANY ESTEEM
IN EXTREME MISERY THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
THOSE GODS THAT ARE ALWAYS ACTIVE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING DECISIVE THAT HELEN WHO IS THE CAUSE OF THE WAR AND WHO YET SCARCELY APPEARS IN THE PIECE
SPEECH CAN NOT CONTAIN OUR LOVE THERE WAS THERE IS NO GENTLER STRONGER
MOST EXQUISITE YET ONE OF THE MOST SAD AND MOURNFUL SERMONS THE FUNERAL OF
THE UNDERTAKER GAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE NOD MISTER MILLER LOOKED APPEALINGLY TOWARD THE DISTINGUISHED ORATOR AND THEN COLONEL INGERSOLL ADVANCED TO THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE MADE A MOTION DENOTING A DESIRE FOR SILENCE
THIS OBSCURE WHIMSICAL AND DISAGREEABLE POEM WAS DESPISED UPON ITS FIRST PUBLICATION AND I ONLY TREAT IT NOW AS IT WAS TREATED IN ITS OWN COUNTRY BY CONTEMPORARIES FOR THE MATTER OF THAT
ANOTHER LIFE IS NAUGHT UNLESS WE KNOW AND LOVE AGAIN THE ONES WHO LOVE US HERE THEY WHO STAND WITH BREAKING HEARTS AROUND THIS LITTLE GRAVE NEED HAVE NO FEAR
THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN OF SIXTY AND VERY RICH HE RECEIVED THE TWO TRAVELLERS WITH POLITE INDIFFERENCE WHICH PUT CANDIDE A LITTLE OUT OF COUNTENANCE BUT WAS NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO MARTIN
IT MAY BE THAT DEATH GIVES ALL THERE IS OF WORTH TO LIFE IF THOSE WHO PRESS AND STRAIN AGAINST OUR HEARTS COULD NEVER DIE PERHAPS THAT LOVE WOULD WITHER FROM THE EARTH
JUST IN THE HAPPIEST SUNNIEST HOUR OF ALL THE VOYAGE WHILE EAGER WINDS ARE KISSING EVERY SAIL TO DASH AGAINST THE UNSEEN ROCK AND IN AN INSTANT HEAR THE BILLOWS ROAR OVER A SUNKEN SHIP
BUT I CARE LITTLE FOR HIS JOURNEY TO BRUNDUSIUM
I SAY WHAT I THINK AND I CARE VERY LITTLE WHETHER OTHERS THINK AS I DO
MARTIN FOUND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF REASON IN POCOCURANTE'S REMARKS
AND HIS ACCOUNT OF A BAD DINNER OR OF HIS LOW QUARREL BETWEEN ONE RUPILIUS WHOSE WORDS HE SAYS WERE FULL OF POISONOUS FILTH AND ANOTHER WHOSE LANGUAGE WAS IMBUED WITH VINEGAR I HAVE READ WITH MUCH DISTASTE HIS INDELICATE VERSES AGAINST OLD WOMEN AND WITCHES
IF HE FIND HER HE WILL KEEP HER TO HIMSELF IF HE DO NOT FIND HER HE WILL GET ANOTHER I ADVISE YOU TO FORGET YOUR VALET CACAMBO AND YOUR MISTRESS CUNEGONDE MARTIN WAS NOT CONSOLING
THE TEARFUL IGNORANCE OF THE ONE IS JUST AS CONSOLING AS THE LEARNED AND UNMEANING WORDS OF THE OTHER
YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT MY DEAR MARTIN ALL IS MISERY AND ILLUSION HE FELL INTO A DEEP MELANCHOLY AND NEITHER WENT TO SEE THE OPERA NOR ANY OF THE OTHER DIVERSIONS OF THE CARNIVAL
PAQUETTE WORKED AT EMBROIDERY THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
AND EVERY MOMENT JEWELED WITH A JOY WILL AT ITS CLOSE BECOME A TRAGEDY
SOON AFTER MISTER INGERSOLL BEGAN TO READ HIS ELOQUENT CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DEAD HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS HE TRIED TO HIDE THEM BEHIND HIS EYE GLASSES
OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM
THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE AND AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
THERE SAID HE IS A BOOK THAT WAS ONCE THE DELIGHT OF THE GREAT PANGLOSS THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN GERMANY IT IS NOT MINE ANSWERED POCOCURANTE COOLLY
MARTIN WAS FOR THROWING THE BARON INTO THE SEA CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP
CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE WAS FATIGUED WITH HARD WORK AND CURSED HIS DESTINY PANGLOSS WAS IN DESPAIR AT NOT SHINING IN SOME GERMAN UNIVERSITY
AND ONE THOUSAND TO FRIAR GIROFLEE I'LL ANSWER FOR IT SAID HE THAT WITH THIS THEY WILL BE HAPPY I DO NOT BELIEVE IT AT ALL SAID MARTIN YOU WILL PERHAPS WITH THESE PIASTRES ONLY RENDER THEM THE MORE UNHAPPY
CANDIDE HAD NOT VIEWED HER AS YET WITH ATTENTION HIS THOUGHTS BEING ENTIRELY TAKEN UP WITH CUNEGONDE BUT RECOLLECTING HER AS SHE SPOKE
HE ONE DAY GAVE HER SO EFFECTUAL A REMEDY TO CURE HER OF A SLIGHT COLD THAT SHE DIED TWO HOURS AFTER IN MOST HORRID CONVULSIONS THE WIFE'S RELATIONS PROSECUTED THE HUSBAND HE TOOK FLIGHT AND I WAS THROWN INTO JAIL
THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
AND DROPPING A FEW TEARS NO SOONER HAD SHE SET FOOT IN CANDIDE'S APARTMENT THAN SHE CRIED OUT
MAYBE A COMMON FAITH TREADS FROM OUT THE PATHS BETWEEN OUR HEARTS THE WEEDS OF SELFISHNESS AND I SHOULD RATHER LIVE AND LOVE WHERE DEATH IS KING THAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE WHERE LOVE IS NOT
I WAS SOON SUPPLANTED BY A RIVAL TURNED OUT OF DOORS QUITE DESTITUTE AND OBLIGED TO CONTINUE THIS ABOMINABLE TRADE
IN POINTING OUT FAULTS WHERE OTHERS SEE NOTHING BUT BEAUTIES THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL
I WISH THAT ALL THE THEATINS WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED A HUNDRED TIMES TO SET FIRE TO THE CONVENT AND GO AND BECOME A TURK
SHE LOOKED AMOROUSLY AT HER THEATIN AND FROM TIME TO TIME PINCHED HIS FAT CHEEKS
FROM THE WONDROUS TREE OF LIFE THE BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FALL WITH RIPENED FRUIT AND IN THE COMMON BED OF EARTH PATRIARCHS AND BABES SLEEP SIDE BY SIDE
A GONDOLIER AN ABBE TO BE EXPOSED TO ABUSE AND INSULTS TO BE OFTEN REDUCED TO BORROWING A PETTICOAT ONLY TO GO AND HAVE IT RAISED BY A DISAGREEABLE MAN
THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
THE SCENE WAS INTENSELY DRAMATIC A FINE DRIZZLING RAIN WAS FALLING AND EVERY HEAD WAS BENT AND EVERY EAR TURNED TO CATCH THE IMPASSIONED WORDS OF ELOQUENCE AND HOPE THAT FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE FAMED ORATOR
SUCH SPECTACLES AS THESE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF THEIR DISSERTATIONS AND WHEN THEY DID NOT DISPUTE TIME HUNG SO HEAVILY UPON THEIR HANDS THAT ONE DAY THE OLD WOMAN VENTURED TO SAY TO THEM I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE
ALAS SAID HE SOFTLY TO MARTIN I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN
MY INNOCENCE WOULD NOT HAVE SAVED ME IF I HAD NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING THE JUDGE SET ME FREE ON CONDITION THAT HE SUCCEEDED THE SURGEON
WELL SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR LEAVE YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
OR HE WHO JOURNEYS ALL THE LENGTH OF LIFE'S UNEVEN ROAD PAINFULLY TAKING THE LAST SLOW STEPS WITH STAFF AND CRUTCH EVERY CRADLE ASKS US WHENCE AND EVERY COFFIN WHITHER
THE FLOWER OF HEALTH SHINES IN YOUR FACE YOUR EXPRESSION MAKES PLAIN YOUR HAPPINESS YOU HAVE A VERY PRETTY GIRL FOR YOUR RECREATION AND YOU SEEM WELL SATISFIED WITH YOUR STATE AS A THEATIN MY FAITH SIR SAID FRIAR GIROFLEE
FOOLS ADMIRE EVERYTHING IN AN AUTHOR OF REPUTATION FOR MY PART I READ ONLY TO PLEASE MYSELF I LIKE ONLY THAT WHICH SERVES MY PURPOSE
YOU SANG AND YOU BEHAVED SO LOVINGLY TO THE THEATIN THAT YOU SEEMED TO ME AS HAPPY AS YOU PRETEND TO BE NOW THE REVERSE AH SIR ANSWERED PAQUETTE
WHISPERED WITH HIS LATEST BREATH I AM BETTER NOW LET US BELIEVE IN SPITE OF DOUBTS AND DOGMAS AND TEARS AND FEARS THAT THESE DEAR WORDS
ALAS IT WAS I SIR INDEED ANSWERED PAQUETTE I SEE THAT YOU HAVE HEARD ALL
THIS GENTLEMAN WAS COLONEL ROBERT G INGERSOLL A FRIEND OF THE MILLERS WHO HAD ATTENDED THE FUNERAL AT THEIR REQUEST HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WHEN THE UNDERTAKER FIRST ADDRESSED HIM AND THEN SAID SUDDENLY DOES MISSUS MILLER DESIRE IT
I DO NOT BLAME YOU FOR LOVING HIM THUVIA SHE SAID AND THAT YOUR AFFECTION FOR HIM IS PURE AND SINCERE I CAN WELL BELIEVE FROM THE CANDOUR OF YOUR AVOWAL OF IT TO ME THE FLEET CONTINUED NORTH NEARLY TO HELIUM BUT LAST NIGHT THEY EVIDENTLY REALIZED THAT JOHN CARTER HAD INDEED ESCAPED THEM
I HAD BACKED INTO THE PIT WHICH HAD RECEIVED ISSUS FOR A SECOND I TOPPLED THERE UPON THE BRINK THEN I TOO WITH THE BOY STILL TIGHTLY CLUTCHED IN MY ARMS PITCHED BACKWARD INTO THE BLACK ABYSS WE STRUCK A POLISHED CHUTE
WERE IT NECESSARY IF IT THROWS ALL HELIUM INTO A BLOODY CONFLICT I SHALL GO ON WITH THESE PLANS TO SAVE MY PRINCESS NOTHING SHALL STAY ME NOW SHORT OF DEATH AND SHOULD I DIE MY FRIENDS
I LAY ALL NIGHT WHERE I HAD FALLEN AND THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT AN EXPLANATION OF THE FORTUNATE COINCIDENCE THAT HAD SAVED ME FROM A TERRIBLE DEATH AS THE SUN ROSE I SAW A VAST PANORAMA OF SEA BOTTOM AND DISTANT HILLS LYING FAR BELOW ME
WHEN THE FEET TREAD EMPTY AIR AND THE DISTANCE BELOW IS SHROUDED IN DARKNESS THERE IS A FEELING AKIN TO PANIC AT THE THOUGHT OF RELEASING THE HOLD AND TAKING THE PLUNGE INTO UNKNOWN DEPTHS ALTHOUGH THE BOY HAD TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BUT TEN FEET TO THE FLOOR BELOW
THE OPENING ABOVE US CLOSED AS MAGICALLY AS IT HAD OPENED AND WE SHOT DOWN UNHARMED INTO A DIMLY LIGHTED APARTMENT FAR BELOW THE ARENA AS I ROSE TO MY FEET THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS THE MALIGNANT COUNTENANCE OF ISSUS GLARING AT ME
EVIDENTLY THIS SEEMED TO HIM THE EASIEST WAY OF RIDDING THE VESSEL OF MY PRESENCE AND KILLING ME AT THE SAME TIME BUT A KIND FATE INTERVENED AND BY A MIRACLE I ESCAPED WITH BUT SLIGHT BRUISES THE SHIP WAS MOVING SLOWLY AT THE TIME
AND THE CLANK OF METAL AND THE CLANG OF SWORDS WITHOUT ANOTHER GLANCE TOWARD ME WHO HAD STOOD A SPECTATOR OF THE TRAGIC SCENE THE NOBLES WHEELED AND FLED FROM THE APARTMENT THROUGH ANOTHER EXIT
AND NOTED THAT THE SOUND OF THE BATTLE ANTHEM HAD CEASED WAS DEJAH THORIS PREPARING TO TAKE HER PLACE BESIDE ME HEROIC DAUGHTER OF A HEROIC WORLD IT WOULD NOT BE UNLIKE HER TO HAVE SEIZED A SWORD AND FOUGHT AT MY SIDE
I WANTED THE MEN OF HELIUM TO SEE ME AND TO KNOW THAT THEIR BELOVED PRINCESS WAS HERE TOO FOR I KNEW THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE WOULD INSPIRE THEM TO EVEN GREATER DEEDS OF VALOR THAN THEY HAD PERFORMED IN THE PAST THOUGH GREAT INDEED MUST HAVE BEEN THOSE WHICH WON FOR THEM
WITH YOU AND CARTHORIS OUT OF THE WAY THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO PREVENT HIM FROM ASSUMING THE TITLE OF JEDDAK AND YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT SO LONG AS HE IS SUPREME HERE THERE IS NO SAFETY FOR EITHER OF YOU THERE IS A WAY CRIED HOR VASTUS TO THWART HIM EFFECTUALLY AND FOR EVER
I LABOURED WITH THE OTHER SLAVES A YEAR SINCE IN THE REMODELLING OF THESE SUBTERRANEAN GALLERIES AND AT THAT TIME WE FOUND BELOW THESE AN ANCIENT SYSTEM OF CORRIDORS AND CHAMBERS THAT HAD BEEN SEALED UP FOR AGES THE BLACKS IN CHARGE OF THE WORK EXPLORED THEM
HAVE I KNOWN SUCH COMPLETE ABSENCE OF LIGHT AS EXISTED IN THE PITS OF ISSUS FOR AN INSTANT I HUNG IN MID AIR THERE IS A STRANGE SENSATION CONNECTED WITH AN EXPERIENCE OF THAT NATURE WHICH IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE
THE RESULT OF WHICH IS SHOWN IN THE PRESENT SPLENDID RACE OF RED MEN I HAD ALWAYS SUPPOSED THAT ALL TRACES OF THE ORIGINAL RACES HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE FACE OF MARS YET WITHIN THE PAST FOUR DAYS I HAD FOUND BOTH WHITES AND BLACKS IN GREAT MULTITUDES
AND WE MAY RETURN TO THE BATTLE WHILE SHE WHO IS NOW THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM LOOKS DOWN FROM THE QUEEN'S TOWER UPON THE ANNIHILATION OF HER FORMER COUNTRYMEN AND WITNESSES THE GREATNESS
WHEREVER HE MIGHT LEAD AS WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE OVER A MILLION MEN TO MAN THE THOUSAND GREAT BATTLESHIPS WE INTENDED TO USE ON OMEAN AND THE TRANSPORTS FOR THE GREEN MEN AS WELL AS THE SHIPS THAT WERE TO CONVOY THE TRANSPORTS
AND IT GAVE THE RED MEN IN THE CORRIDOR BEYOND NO AVENUE OF ESCAPE SHOULD THEIR NEW ANTAGONISTS PRESS THEM TOO CLOSELY BUT I HAVE FACED HEAVIER ODDS MYSELF THAN WERE PITTED AGAINST ME THAT DAY
WHEN HOWEVER I SAW THE VILE HAND OF SALENSUS OLL REACH OUT FOR THE HAND OF MY BELOVED PRINCESS I COULD RESTRAIN MYSELF NO LONGER AND BEFORE THE NOBLES OF OKAR KNEW THAT AUGHT HAD HAPPENED
YERSTED THAT WILL BE THE SIMPLER WAY TO RETURN I SAID SMILING AS I HANDED THE FORGED ORDER TO THE BOY COME WE SHALL SEE NOW HOW WELL IT WORKS BUT OUR SWORDS HE EXCLAIMED WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO EXPLAIN THEM
IMMEDIATELY TWO GUARDSMEN APPEARED DRAGGING THE UNWILLING BRIDE TOWARD THE ALTAR HER HANDS WERE STILL MANACLED BEHIND HER EVIDENTLY TO PREVENT SUICIDE HER DISHEVELED HAIR AND PANTING BOSOM BETOKENED THAT
AS LAY WITHIN THE POWER OF MY SWORD ARM IT WAS A GLORIOUS BATTLE BUT THE END SEEMED INEVITABLE
TAKING SEVERAL OF US ALONG TO DO WHATEVER WORK THERE MIGHT BE OCCASION FOR I KNOW THE ENTIRE SYSTEM PERFECTLY THERE ARE MILES OF CORRIDORS HONEYCOMBING THE GROUND BENEATH THE GARDENS AND THE TEMPLE ITSELF
FATHER OF THERNS AND PHAIDOR HIS DAUGHTER PEERING INTO THE ROOM A QUICK GLANCE ABOUT THEY TOOK THEIR EYES RESTED FOR A MOMENT WIDE IN HORROR UPON THE DEAD BODY OF SALENSUS OLL UPON THE BLOOD THAT CRIMSONED THE FLOOR UPON THE CORPSES OF THE NOBLES
THE PASSAGEWAY HAD RISEN RAPIDLY SINCE LEAVING THE APARTMENT OF THE SWITCH AND NOW RAN LEVEL AND WELL LIGHTED STRAIGHT INTO THE DISTANCE AS FAR AS I COULD SEE THE MOMENT THAT MY PURSUERS REACHED THIS STRAIGHT STRETCH I WOULD BE IN PLAIN SIGHT OF THEM
THE FORMER AGREED TO TAKE SUCH VESSELS AS WE REQUIRED INTO DOCK AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
I KNEW THAT SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED THEN TO CAUSE HER THE KEENEST MENTAL AGONY AND WHEN I DISCOVERED HER CREEPING FROM THE PALACE I DID NOT NEED TO BE TOLD HER DESTINATION HASTILY AROUSING A DOZEN OF HER MOST FAITHFUL GUARDS I EXPLAINED MY FEARS TO THEM
SO THAT TO ME WAS LEFT THE REMNANTS OF THE YELLOW MEN WITHIN THE THRONEROOM THEY KEPT ME BUSY TOO
AND THE DETAILS OF THE ENTIRE PLAN HAD BEEN MAPPED OUT
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY A FORCE OF YELLOW WARRIORS APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THROUGH WHICH THE MESSENGER HAD COME THEY WERE BACKING TOWARD THE APARTMENT STUBBORNLY RESISTING THE ADVANCE OF A HANDFUL OF RED MEN WHO FACED THEM AND FORCED THEM SLOWLY BUT INEVITABLY BACK
CHAINED THOUGH SHE WAS STILL HAD SHE FOUGHT AGAINST THE THING THAT THEY WOULD DO TO HER AT SIGHT OF HER SALENSUS OLL ROSE AND DREW HIS SWORD
WHEN THEY HAD COME INTO THE CORRIDOR WITH ME THEY TURNED TOWARD A SECRET PANEL IN THE WALL WHICH LED TO THE PASSAGE THAT TERMINATED IN THE PITS BENEATH THE PALACE THAT ANY KNEW OF THIS PANEL OUTSIDE MY OWN HOUSEHOLD I WAS DOUBTFUL YET THE LEADER OF THE BAND DID NOT HESITATE A MOMENT
I HOPE HE HEARD ONLY OUR REFERENCES TO A NEW JEDDAK I SAID IF HE OVERHEARD OUR PLANS TO RESCUE DEJAH THORIS IT WILL MEAN CIVIL WAR FOR HE WILL ATTEMPT TO THWART US AND IN THAT I WILL NOT BE THWARTED THERE WOULD I TURN AGAINST TARDOS MORS HIMSELF
AND A MOMENT LATER MY ARMS AND LEGS SECURELY BOUND SO QUICKLY HAD THEY WORKED AND TO SUCH GOOD PURPOSE THAT I WAS UTTERLY BEYOND THE POWER TO RESIST THEM BY THE TIME I WAS FULLY AWAKE NEVER A WORD SPOKE THEY AND THE GAG EFFECTUALLY PREVENTED ME SPEAKING
A LOOK OF FIERCE RAGE OVERSPREAD THE FEATURES OF MATAI SHANG AND A COLD AND CUNNING SMILE TOUCHED THE LIPS OF PHAIDOR THEN THEY WERE GONE BUT NOT BEFORE A TAUNTING LAUGH WAS THROWN DIRECTLY IN MY FACE BY THE WOMAN
THE GUARDS BELOW THERE THE GUARDS WE WERE CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND ALL SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN RUN QUICKLY ACROSS A LITTLE PIECE OF SWARD AND DISAPPEAR IN THE SHRUBBERY BEYOND HE WAS ON THE BALCONY WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM CRIED HOR VASTUS QUICK LET US FOLLOW HIM
KANTOS KAN HE WAS LEADING THE LITTLE PARTY THAT HAD WON ITS WAY INTO THE VERY HEART OF THE PALACE OF SALENSUS OLL IN AN INSTANT I SAW THAT BY ATTACKING THE OKARIANS FROM THE REAR I COULD SO QUICKLY DISORGANIZE THEM THAT THEIR FURTHER RESISTANCE WOULD BE SHORT LIVED
WHOM IT WAS OUR PLAN TO SEND IN TRANSPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE VALLEY DOR AND THE TEMPLE OF ISSUS WHILE THE FLEET ENTERED OMEAN AND DESTROYED THE VESSELS OF THE FIRST BORN UPON HOR VASTUS DEVOLVED THE DELICATE MISSION OF ORGANISING A SECRET FORCE OF FIGHTING MEN SWORN TO FOLLOW JOHN CARTER
ONLY OUR FIRST ANCESTOR KNOWS HE REPLIED WE REACHED THE SUBMARINE POOL IN OMEAN WITHOUT INCIDENT HERE WE DEBATED THE WISDOM OF SINKING THE CRAFT BEFORE LEAVING HER BUT FINALLY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD ADD NOTHING TO OUR CHANCES FOR ESCAPE
BUT OF A SUDDEN THE OLD FIRE OF UNCONQUERABLE SELF CONFIDENCE SURGED THROUGH ME I SPRANG TO MY FEET AND WITH BACK THROWN SHOULDERS AND UPRAISED SWORD TOOK A SOLEMN VOW TO REACH RESCUE AND REVENGE MY PRINCESS A HUNDRED SWORDS LEAPED FROM A HUNDRED SCABBARDS
WHEN I REACHED IT I FOUND TO MY DELIGHT THAT IT BELONGED TO HELIUM HERE A THOAT WAS PROCURED FOR ME THE REST YOU KNOW FOR MANY MINUTES NONE SPOKE DEJAH THORIS IN THE CLUTCHES OF THE FIRST BORN I SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT
THAT THEY CONSIDERED THE CAPTURE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN IMPORTANT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE LONG AND EARNEST INTERVIEW THE COMMANDER OF THE FLEET HELD WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM LATER SHE WAS BOUND AND PLACED IN THE COMPARTMENT WITH DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF THE NEW CAPTIVE WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL
BUT ANOTHER UPON ITS LEFT THEY MUST HAVE EITHER HEARD OR GUESSED WHICH WAY I WENT FOR I HAD PROCEEDED BUT A SHORT DISTANCE WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF PURSUIT I HAD NO MIND TO STOP AND FIGHT THESE MEN HERE WHEN THERE WAS FIGHTING APLENTY ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY OF KADABRA
AND HIS LOYALTY AND DEVOTION TO THE PRINCESS OF HIS CHOICE DEJAH THORIS BROKE DOWN AND WEPT
FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME AT LEAST THEY WILL BE COMPARATIVELY SAFE HE SAID AND WE WILL AT LEAST KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THEM
BLACKNESS PLEASANT OLD LADY SAID A VOICE AT MY SIDE WHO SPEAKS I ASKED TIS I YOUR COMPANION WHO HAS HAD THE HONOUR THIS DAY OF FIGHTING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE GREATEST WARRIOR THAT EVER WORE METAL UPON BARSOOM
FOR A MOMENT TENSE SILENCE REIGNED IN THE NUPTIAL ROOM THEN THE FIFTY NOBLES RUSHED UPON ME FURIOUSLY WE FOUGHT BUT THE ADVANTAGE WAS MINE FOR I STOOD UPON A RAISED PLATFORM ABOVE THEM AND I FOUGHT FOR THE MOST GLORIOUS WOMAN OF A GLORIOUS RACE
BUT SOLAN'S LAST LOUD CRY HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT EFFECT FOR A MOMENT LATER A DOZEN GUARDSMEN BURST INTO THE CHAMBER THOUGH NOT BEFORE I HAD SO BENT AND DEMOLISHED THE GREAT SWITCH THAT IT COULD NOT BE AGAIN USED TO TURN THE POWERFUL CURRENT
OF CATS WE DROPPED TOGETHER INTO THE MAIN CABIN OF THE SUBMARINE EVEN HERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE QUICKLY WE COVERED AND SECURED THE HATCH THEN THE BOY STEPPED INTO THE PILOT HOUSE TOUCHED A BUTTON AND THE BOAT SANK AMID SWIRLING WATERS TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
AND THEN OF A SUDDEN ALL THAT REMAINED OF THEM FORMED BELOW ME FOR A LAST MAD DESPERATE CHARGE BUT EVEN AS THEY ADVANCED THE DOOR AT THE FAR END OF THE CHAMBER SWUNG WIDE AND A WILD EYED MESSENGER SPRANG INTO THE ROOM THE JEDDAK OF JEDDAKS HE CRIED
FAST AND FURIOUS WAS THE FIGHTING AS THE NOBLES OF SALENSUS OLL SPRANG TIME AND AGAIN UP THE STEPS BEFORE THE THRONE ONLY TO FALL BACK BEFORE A SWORD HAND THAT SEEMED TO HAVE GAINED A NEW WIZARDRY FROM ITS EXPERIENCE WITH THE CUNNING SOLAN
UPON WHICH STOOD SALENSUS OLL AWAITING HIS BRIDE NOW THE GUARDSMEN WERE FORCING THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM UP THE FEW STEPS TO THE SIDE OF THE TYRANT OF OKAR AND I HAD NO EYES AND NO THOUGHTS FOR AUGHT ELSE A PRIEST OPENED A BOOK AND RAISING HIS HAND
ISSUS HERSELF DOES NOT DREAM
SILENTLY THEY LIFTED ME AND BORE ME TOWARD THE DOOR OF MY CHAMBER AS THEY PASSED THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH THE FARTHER MOON WAS CASTING ITS BRILLIANT BEAMS I SAW THAT EACH OF THE PARTY HAD HIS FACE SWATHED IN LAYERS OF SILK I COULD NOT RECOGNIZE ONE OF THEM
I THANK GOD THAT YOU ARE NOT DEAD I SAID I FEARED FOR THAT NASTY CUT UPON YOUR HEAD IT BUT STUNNED ME HE REPLIED A MERE SCRATCH MAYBE IT WERE AS WELL HAD IT BEEN FINAL I SAID
DEJAH THORIS KNEW THAT IT COULD BE NONE OTHER THAN THE PRINCE OF HELIUM FOR WHO SHE SAID UPON ALL BARSOOM OTHER THAN JOHN CARTER COULD HAVE DONE THE DEEDS YOU TELL OF AND WHEN THUVIA TOLD DEJAH THORIS OF HER LOVE FOR JOHN CARTER
THAT ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO INSPIRE ME TO VICTORY OVER EVEN GREATER ODDS AND I VERILY BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BESTED THE ENTIRE ROOMFUL OF YELLOW WARRIORS THAT DAY IN THE NUPTIAL CHAMBER OF THE PALACE AT KADABRA HAD NOT INTERRUPTION COME TO MY AID
FOR MANY YEARS THE BLACK HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE REFITTING OF CAPTURED BATTLESHIPS THAT THEY MIGHT NAVIGATE OMEAN AND SO WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROPELLERS HOUSINGS AND THE AUXILIARY GEARING REQUIRED
A GREAT SHOUT RANG THROUGH THE CORRIDOR AND FOR A MOMENT DROWNED THE NOISE OF BATTLE FOR THE PRINCE OF HELIUM THEY CRIED FOR THE PRINCE OF HELIUM AND LIKE HUNGRY LIONS UPON THEIR PREY THEY FELL ONCE MORE UPON THE WEAKENING WARRIORS OF THE NORTH
WHAT I WAS MOST CONCERNED IN OF COURSE WAS THE RESCUING OF DEJAH THORIS
AND SO THEY TURNED TOWARD THE SOUTH ONCE MORE SHORTLY THEREAFTER A GUARD ENTERED OUR COMPARTMENT AND DRAGGED ME TO THE DECK THERE IS NO PLACE IN THE LAND OF THE FIRST BORN FOR A GREEN ONE HE SAID AND WITH THAT HE GAVE ME A TERRIFIC SHOVE THAT CARRIED ME TOPPLING FROM THE DECK OF THE BATTLESHIP
HE ALONE MAY REVIVE THE FLAGGING COURAGE OF OUR WARRIORS HE ALONE MAY SAVE THE DAY FOR OKAR WHERE IS SALENSUS OLL THE NOBLES STEPPED BACK FROM ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF THEIR RULER AND ONE OF THEM POINTED TO THE GRINNING CORPSE
A WAY INTO THE ALMOST IMPREGNABLE PALACE OF THE TYRANT OF THE NORTH AS I CROSSED THE CHAMBER TO ATTACK THE KADABRANS FROM THE REAR A SMALL DOORWAY AT MY LEFT OPENED AND TO MY SURPRISE REVEALED THE FIGURES OF MATAI SHANG
THE YELLOW MEN CORNERED BETWEEN TWO ENEMIES FOUGHT WITH THE DESPERATION THAT UTTER HOPELESSNESS OFTEN INDUCES FOUGHT AS I SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT
AND I THINK ONCE OUT THAT WE SHALL FIND NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ARMING OURSELVES ONCE MORE IN A COUNTRY WHICH ABOUNDS SO PLENTIFULLY IN ARMED MEN AS YOU SAY HE REPLIED WITH A SMILE AND SHRUG
I SOON SAW THAT THEY WOULD OVERTAKE ME UNLESS I FOUND A PLACE TO CONCEAL MYSELF UNTIL THEY HAD PASSED WHICH WOULD THEN GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN THE WAY I HAD COME AND REGAIN THE TOWER OR POSSIBLY FIND A WAY TO REACH THE CITY STREETS
I TURNED WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS TO SEIZE MY PRINCESS AND AS MY LIPS SMOTHERED HERS TO REAP THE REWARD THAT WOULD BE THRICE AMPLE PAYMENT FOR THE BLOODY ENCOUNTERS THROUGH WHICH I HAD PASSED FOR HER DEAR SAKE FROM THE SOUTH POLE TO THE NORTH
WOULD HAVE TUMBLED ABOUT OUR HEADS BUT EVIDENTLY HE DECIDED THE MESSAGE MUST BE GENUINE NOR INDEED WAS THERE ANY GOOD REASON TO DOUBT IT SINCE IT WOULD SCARCE HAVE SEEMED CREDIBLE TO HIM THAT TWO SLAVES WOULD VOLUNTARILY HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES INTO CUSTODY IN ANY SUCH MANNER AS THIS
THE GUARDS QUICKLY OVERCAME AND KILLED THE MAJORITY OF US HE SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY TAKE THEM TO SHADOR HE ORDERED TURNING TO ONE OF HIS SUBORDINATES
CHAPTER TWELVE DOOMED TO DIE FOR AN INSTANT I STOOD THERE BEFORE THEY FELL UPON ME BUT THE FIRST RUSH OF THEM FORCED ME BACK A STEP OR TWO MY FOOT FELT FOR THE FLOOR BUT FOUND ONLY EMPTY SPACE
TOGETHER WE RAN TO THE GARDENS BUT EVEN THOUGH WE SCOURED THE GROUNDS WITH THE ENTIRE GUARD FOR HOURS NO TRACE COULD WE FIND OF THE NIGHT MARAUDER WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT KANTOS KAN ASKED TARS TARKAS A SPY SENT BY ZAT ARRAS HE REPLIED IT WAS EVER HIS WAY
SINCE WE CANNOT EXPLAIN THEM WE SHALL HAVE TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND US I REPLIED IS IT NOT THE
WHO HAD FALLEN THICK BEFORE THE THRONE UPON ME AND UPON THE BATTLING WARRIORS AT THE OTHER DOOR THEY DID NOT ESSAY TO ENTER THE APARTMENT BUT SCANNED ITS EVERY CORNER FROM WHERE THEY STOOD AND THEN WHEN THEIR EYES HAD SOUGHT ITS ENTIRE AREA
IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE OUR PREPARATIONS IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE UTMOST SECRECY MUST BE MAINTAINED TO KEEP THE PROJECT FROM THE EARS OF ZAT ARRAS KANTOS KAN WAS CONFIDENT NOW THAT THE MAN'S AMBITIONS WERE FULLY AROUSED
EVEN THEN THERE WAS NO SCURRYING OF FEET AS WE HAD EXPECTED AND WHILE THE BOY REMAINED TO DIRECT THE BOAT I SLID FROM CABIN TO CABIN IN FUTILE SEARCH FOR SOME MEMBER OF THE CREW
AND LOOKING UP I BEHELD AT A LONG DISTANCE BEFORE US A DIM RADIANCE AS WE ADVANCED THE LIGHT INCREASED UNTIL PRESENTLY WE EMERGED INTO WELL LIGHTED PASSAGEWAYS FROM THEN ON OUR PROGRESS WAS RAPID UNTIL WE CAME SUDDENLY TO THE END OF A CORRIDOR
WITH A SNARL HE SPRANG TOWARD ME WITH NAKED SWORD BUT WHETHER SALENSUS OLL WAS A GOOD SWORDSMAN OR A POOR I NEVER LEARNED FOR WITH DEJAH THORIS AT MY BACK I WAS NO LONGER HUMAN I WAS A SUPERMAN AND NO MAN COULD HAVE WITHSTOOD ME THEN
HE LAUGHED A LOW LAUGH OF PLEASURE AND RELIEF AND THEN REACHING OUT THROUGH THE INKY BLACKNESS HE SOUGHT MY SHOULDER AND PULLED MY EAR CLOSE TO HIS MOUTH NOTHING COULD BE BETTER HE WHISPERED THERE ARE SECRETS WITHIN THE SECRETS OF ISSUS OF WHICH
TARS TARKAS WAS TO GET INTO COMMUNICATION WITH THARK AND LEARN THE SENTIMENTS OF HIS PEOPLE TOWARD HIS RETURN FROM DOR IF FAVOURABLE HE WAS TO REPAIR IMMEDIATELY TO THARK AND DEVOTE HIS TIME TO THE ASSEMBLING OF A GREAT HORDE OF GREEN WARRIORS
IF SUCH A THING WERE POSSIBLE
AND I KNEW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD BATTLED HIS WAY FROM A HUNDRED MORE DANGEROUS TRAPS THAN THAT IN WHICH HE NOW WAS SO IT WAS WITH NO FEELINGS OF DESPAIR THAT I TURNED MY ATTENTION TO THE BUSINESS OF THE MOMENT CONSTANTLY MY THOUGHTS REVERTED TO DEJAH THORIS
I HAD HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK FORWARD TO SINCE I HAD RETURNED TO BARSOOM BUT EVEN NOW I WAS TO BE DISAPPOINTED HOW LONG I SLEPT I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I AWOKE SUDDENLY IT WAS TO FIND A HALF DOZEN POWERFUL MEN UPON ME A GAG ALREADY IN MY MOUTH
IT WAS NO TRIFLING JOB THAT HOR VASTUS HAD BEFORE HIM AFTER THEY HAD LEFT I BID CARTHORIS GOOD NIGHT FOR I WAS VERY TIRED AND GOING TO MY OWN APARTMENTS BATHED AND LAY DOWN UPON MY SLEEPING SILKS AND FURS FOR THE FIRST GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
THROUGH THE HEAVY BARS OF A GRATED DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF THE CHAMBER RASH MORTAL SHE SHRILLED YOU SHALL PAY THE AWFUL PENALTY FOR YOUR BLASPHEMY IN THIS SECRET CELL HERE YOU SHALL LIE ALONE AND IN DARKNESS WITH THE CARCASS OF YOUR ACCOMPLICE
WILL YOU TAKE OATH TO PROSECUTE THE SEARCH FOR HER AND BRING HER BACK IN SAFETY TO HER GRANDFATHER'S COURT UPON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD EACH OF THEM SWORE TO DO AS I HAD ASKED IT WAS AGREED THAT THE BATTLESHIPS THAT WERE TO BE REMODELLED SHOULD BE ORDERED TO HASTOR
WHERE SHE STOOD BEHIND ME BESIDE THE THRONE OF THE DEAD RULER I WONDERED WHY SHE NO LONGER URGED ME ON WITH THE STRAINS OF THE MARTIAL HYMN OF HELIUM BUT I DID NOT NEED MORE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS BATTLING FOR HER TO BRING OUT THE BEST THAT IS IN ME
FROM SCRAPS OF CONVERSATION WHICH WE OVERHEARD IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BLACK PIRATES WERE SEARCHING FOR A PARTY OF FUGITIVES THAT HAD ESCAPED THEM SEVERAL DAYS PRIOR
ANOTHER HELIUMETIC CITY FAR TO THE SOUTH WEST KANTOS KAN THOUGHT THAT THE DOCKS THERE IN ADDITION TO THEIR REGULAR WORK WOULD ACCOMMODATE AT LEAST SIX BATTLESHIPS AT A TIME AS HE WAS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE NAVY
ONCE WITHIN THE PALACE I DREW SOLA TO THE DINING HALL AND WHEN SHE HAD GREETED HER FATHER AFTER THE FORMAL MANNER OF THE GREEN MEN SHE TOLD THE STORY OF THE PILGRIMAGE AND CAPTURE OF DEJAH THORIS SEVEN DAYS AGO AFTER HER AUDIENCE WITH ZAT ARRAS DEJAH THORIS ATTEMPTED TO SLIP FROM THE PALACE IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT
HIS REPRESENTATIVE AS YOU WILL JOHN CARTER SAID HOR VASTUS BUT WHAT WAS THAT HE WHISPERED POINTING TOWARD THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE GARDENS THE WORDS WERE SCARCE OUT OF HIS MOUTH ERE HE HAD SPRUNG TO THE BALCONY WITHOUT THERE HE GOES HE CRIED EXCITEDLY
ON THE UNGUESSABLE ANTIQUITY OF THESE LONG FORGOTTEN CORRIDORS THE THINGS WHICH THE STYGIAN DARKNESS HID FROM MY OBJECTIVE EYE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HALF SO WONDERFUL AS THE PICTURES WHICH MY IMAGINATION WROUGHT AS IT CONJURED TO LIFE AGAIN THE ANCIENT PEOPLES
WITH A SINGLE LOW FOR THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM I RAN MY BLADE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE ROTTEN HEART OF OKAR'S ROTTEN RULER AND BEFORE THE WHITE DRAWN FACES OF HIS NOBLES SALENSUS OLL ROLLED GRINNING IN HORRIBLE DEATH TO THE FOOT OF THE STEPS BELOW HIS MARRIAGE THRONE
AND AS ONE THEY ENLISTED WITH ME TO FOLLOW OUR BELOVED PRINCESS IN HER WANDERINGS EVEN TO THE SACRED ISS AND THE VALLEY DOR WE CAME UPON HER BUT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE PALACE WITH HER WAS FAITHFUL WOOLA THE HOUND BUT NONE OTHER
THAT NO SINGLE MAN MAY BE KEPT FROM HIS PLACE IN THE DEFENSES OTHER THAN THE FIFTY THAT CUSTOM DEMANDS SHALL WITNESS THE CREATION OF A NEW QUEEN IN OKAR
SO I CANNOT DESERT HIM NO SAID THE BOY ONE CANNOT DESERT A FRIEND IT WERE BETTER TO BE RECAPTURED OURSELVES THAN THAT THEN HE COMMENCED GROPING HIS WAY ABOUT THE FLOOR OF THE DARK CHAMBER
AND I WILL REPLACE THE TRAP THIS DONE HE TOOK ME BY THE HAND LEADING ME VERY SLOWLY WITH MUCH FEELING ABOUT AND FREQUENT HALTS TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT STRAY INTO WRONG PASSAGEWAYS
FIGHTING THAT COULD BE OF MUCH MORE AVAIL TO ME AND MINE THAN USELESS LIFE TAKING FAR BELOW THE PALACE BUT THE FELLOWS WERE PRESSING ME AND AS I DID NOT KNOW THE WAY AT ALL
AT SIGHT OF US THE MEMBERS OF THE GUARD SPRANG FORWARD IN SURPRISE AND WITH LEVELLED RIFLES HALTED US I HELD OUT THE MESSAGE TO ONE OF THEM HE TOOK IT AND SEEING TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED TURNED AND HANDED IT TO TORITH
BENEATH WHICH THE POOR BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WAS DRAGGED TOWARD HER DOOM A GRIM SMILE FORCED ITSELF TO MY LIPS AS I THOUGHT OF THE RUDE AWAKENING THAT LAY IN STORE FOR THE RULER OF OKAR AND MY ITCHING FINGERS FONDLED THE HILT OF MY BLOODY SWORD
HERE WE DISCUSSED THE DETAILS OF OUR EXPEDITION UNTIL LONG AFTER DARK
IT WAS THE VERY BOLDNESS OF THE PLAN WHICH RENDERED IT SUCCESSFUL WERE YOU CONNECTED WITH THE RISING OF THE SLAVES ASKED TORITH WE HAVE JUST HAD MEAGRE REPORTS OF SOME SUCH EVENT ALL WERE INVOLVED I REPLIED BUT IT AMOUNTED TO LITTLE
IN THE POWER OF THE FIRST BORN IT IS THE ONLY WAY I ANSWERED
SHE TOLD DEJAH THORIS THAT MANY YEARS AGO SHE HAD TAKEN THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE FROM THE COURT OF HER FATHER THE JEDDAK OF PTARTH SHE WAS THUVIA THE PRINCESS OF PTARTH AND THEN SHE ASKED DEJAH THORIS WHO SHE MIGHT BE
AND I LONGED FOR THE MOMENT WHEN THE FIGHTING DONE I COULD FOLD HER IN MY ARMS AND HEAR ONCE MORE THE WORDS OF LOVE WHICH HAD BEEN DENIED ME FOR SO MANY YEARS DURING THE FIGHTING IN THE CHAMBER I HAD NOT EVEN A SINGLE CHANCE TO SO MUCH AS STEAL A GLANCE AT HER
INTO THE MIGHTY MAGNET OF DESTRUCTION IT CONTROLLED THE RESULT OF THE SUDDEN COMING OF THE GUARDSMEN HAD BEEN TO COMPEL ME TO SEEK SECLUSION IN THE FIRST PASSAGEWAY THAT I COULD FIND AND THAT TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT PROVED TO BE NOT THE ONE WITH WHICH I WAS FAMILIAR
FESTERING IN ITS ROTTENNESS BY YOUR SIDE UNTIL CRAZED BY LONELINESS AND HUNGER YOU FEED UPON THE CRAWLING MAGGOTS THAT WERE ONCE A MAN THAT WAS ALL IN ANOTHER INSTANT SHE WAS GONE AND THE DIM LIGHT WHICH HAD FILLED THE CELL
LOOKED WITHIN THE LARGER APARTMENT BEFORE ME WERE A PARTY OF PERHAPS FIFTY GORGEOUSLY CLAD NOBLES OF THE COURT STANDING BEFORE A THRONE UPON WHICH SAT SALENSUS OLL THE JEDDAK OF JEDDAKS WAS ADDRESSING THEM
OF THE DEAD SEA BOTTOMS THAT HAD DRIVEN THEM STEP BY STEP TO THE UTTERMOST PINNACLE OF THE WORLD WHERE THEY WERE NOW INTRENCHED BEHIND AN IMPENETRABLE BARRIER OF SUPERSTITION IN ADDITION TO THE GREEN MEN THERE HAD BEEN THREE PRINCIPAL RACES UPON BARSOOM
PRESENTLY WE COMMENCED THE DESCENT OF A VERY STEEP INCLINE IT WILL NOT BE LONG HE SAID BEFORE WE SHALL HAVE LIGHT AT THE LOWER LEVELS WE MEET THE SAME STRATUM OF PHOSPHORESCENT ROCK THAT ILLUMINATES OMEAN
WHAT I ASKED HE SMILED I SHALL WHISPER IT HERE BUT SOME DAY I SHALL STAND UPON THE DOME OF THE TEMPLE OF REWARD AND SHOUT IT TO CHEERING MULTITUDES BELOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED KANTOS KAN JOHN CARTER JEDDAK OF HELIUM
WHERE THE BLACKS NEVER GO THERE WE MAY LIVE FOR A TIME AND WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY TRANSPIRE TO AID US TO ESCAPE HE HAD SPOKEN ALL IN A LOW WHISPER EVIDENTLY FEARING SPYING EARS EVEN HERE AND SO I ANSWERED HIM IN THE SAME SUBDUED TONE
OF HELIUM ARE PERMITTED TO CHOOSE FAIRLY THEIR NEXT JEDDAK WHOM THEY CHOOSE MAY COUNT UPON THE LOYALTY OF MY SWORD NOR SHALL I SEEK THE HONOUR FOR MYSELF UNTIL THEN TARDOS MORS IS JEDDAK OF HELIUM
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT IN SOME FAR OFF CORNER OF THE PLANET THERE STILL EXISTED A REMNANT OF THE ANCIENT RACE OF YELLOW MEN MY REVERIES WERE BROKEN IN UPON BY A LOW EXCLAMATION FROM THE BOY AT LAST THE LIGHTED WAY HE CRIED
THE VARIOUS RACES HAD MADE WAR UPON ONE ANOTHER FOR AGES AND THE THREE HIGHER TYPES HAD EASILY BESTED THE GREEN SAVAGES OF THE WATER PLACES OF THE WORLD BUT NOW THAT THE RECEDING SEAS NECESSITATED CONSTANT ABANDONMENT OF THEIR FORTIFIED CITIES
AND WHEN SHE HEARD SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES AND KISSED DEJAH THORIS FETTERED HANDS AND TOLD HER THAT THAT VERY MORNING SHE HAD BEEN WITH JOHN CARTER PRINCE OF HELIUM AND CARTHORIS HER SON DEJAH THORIS COULD NOT BELIEVE HER AT FIRST
AND BY THIS MECHANICAL MEANS HIDE THE LACK OF A DEFINITE PROGRAM FOR LIQUIDATING THE WAR AT THE SAME TIME IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH AN ADVANCE CANNOT BUT COMPLETELY DISORGANIZE THE ARMY BY SETTING UP ITS VARIOUS UNITS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER
IT SLAMMED AGAIN THE CURTAINS OF MY STUDY FLUTTERED OUT OF THE OPEN WINDOW FROM WHICH I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD WATCHED THE DAWN NO ONE HAD CLOSED IT SINCE THE SMASHED BUSHES WERE JUST AS I HAD LEFT THEM NEARLY FOUR WEEKS AGO
WHILE AMONG THE WORKINGMEN MUCH DISCONTENT HAD ACCUMULATED WHICH CRAVED FOR OUTWARD EXPRESSION AVAIL YOURSELVES OF THE RESIGNATIONS OF THE CADET MINISTERS
THOUGH ITS ONLY PRETENSIONS TO BEING A ROAD WAS THAT IT LED FROM SHACKLE'S FARM TO THE FIELDS WHICH BORDERED THE CLIFF AND CONSISTED OF TWO DEEP CHANNELS MADE BY THE FARM TUMBRIL WHEELS
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE UNSUCCESSFUL MILITARY ADVANCE OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH MIGHT DEAL A BLOW NOT ONLY TO THE REVOLUTION BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT TEMPORARILY THEY THREW THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF RESPONSIBILITY UPON THEIR ALLIES TO THE LEFT
AND ON BY THE SPOT WHERE THE MARTIAN HAD APPEARED TO ME IN THE THUNDERSTORM HERE MOVED BY CURIOSITY I TURNED ASIDE TO FIND AMONG A TANGLE OF RED FRONDS THE WARPED AND BROKEN DOG CART
WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE CUSTOMARY NAVVIES AND WE WERE JOLTED OVER A HASTY RELAYING ALL DOWN THE LINE FROM THERE THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS GAUNT AND UNFAMILIAR WIMBLEDON PARTICULARLY HAD SUFFERED
AND A BIT OF PRIME TAY SUCH AS WOULD PLEASE HER LADYSHIP THEN THINK HOW PLEASANT A PIPE IS SIR RISDON
FOR A SPACE I STOOD READING OVER MY ABANDONED ARGUMENTS IT WAS A PAPER ON THE PROBABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MORAL IDEAS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CIVILISING PROCESS AND THE LAST SENTENCE WAS THE OPENING OF A PROPHECY
IN THE MERE WANTONNESS OF POWER I WAS A LONELY MAN AND THEY WERE VERY KIND TO ME I WAS A LONELY MAN AND A SAD ONE AND THEY BORE WITH ME I REMAINED WITH THEM FOUR DAYS AFTER MY RECOVERY
I I CANNOT MASTER SHACKLE IT IS AGAINST THE LAW
FROM VARIOUS POINTS AT THE FRONT CAME DELEGATES AND PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS TELLING OF THE CHAOS WHICH REIGNED IN THE ARMY AS A RESULT OF THE ADVANCE THE SO CALLED GOVERNMENT PRESS DEMANDED SEVERE REPRESSIONS
BUT BY POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE NINETEENTH OF JUNE THERE WAS A SO CALLED PATRIOTIC DEMONSTRATION IN THE STREETS OF PETROGRAD THE NEVSKY PROSPECT
THERE WERE THE MUTTON AND THE BREAD BOTH FAR GONE NOW IN DECAY AND A BEER BOTTLE OVERTURNED JUST AS I AND THE ARTILLERYMAN HAD LEFT THEM MY HOME WAS DESOLATE I PERCEIVED THE FOLLY OF THE FAINT HOPE I HAD CHERISHED SO LONG
MADE MORE WEIGHTY BY THE GREATCOAT OF CAKED MUD THE VEHICLE WORE
THEY DON'T WANT US TO SEND THEM FISH MY LADY'S TOO PROUD
THE NURSERY GROUNDS WERE EVERYWHERE CRIMSON WITH THE WEED
THAT THOSE CONCESSIONS WHICH HE AND TERESHCHENKO HAD MADE TO THE KIEV RADA DID NOT BY ANY MEANS SIGNIFY A DISMEMBERMENT OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT THIS THEREFORE DID NOT GIVE THE CADETS ANY GOOD REASON FOR LEAVING THE MINISTRY
I STUMBLED INTO THE HALL AND THE HOUSE FELT EMPTY THE STAIR CARPET WAS RUFFLED AND DISCOLOURED WHERE I HAD CROUCHED SOAKED TO THE SKIN FROM THE THUNDERSTORM THE NIGHT OF THE CATASTROPHE
TO DRIVE THE BOURGEOISIE OUT OF POWER AND PROMOTE THE AIMS OF THE REVOLUTION OR TO ADOPT THE POLICY OF BRIDLING THE PEOPLE BY RESORTING TO REPRESSIVE MEASURES
YOU SEE THE REVENUE CUTTER'S HANGING ABOUT HERE A DEAL AND IT LOOKS BAD SURELY NO ONE WOULD BETRAY YOU MASTER SHACKLE HOPE NOT SIR RISDON
BUT ALSO THEIR BITTER ENMITY TOWARD REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES IN GENERAL THE ALLIED AMBASSADORS WERE PRESSING THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE DEMAND THAT ARMY DISCIPLINE BE RESTORED AND THE ADVANCE CONTINUED THE GREATEST PANIC PREVAILED IN GOVERNMENT CIRCLES
AND I WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU SIR RISDON THE GENTLEMAN STARTED NOT ABOUT
AND THEN A STRANGE THING OCCURRED IT IS NO USE SAID A VOICE THE HOUSE IS DESERTED NO ONE HAS BEEN HERE THESE TEN DAYS DO NOT STAY HERE TO TORMENT YOURSELF NO ONE ESCAPED BUT YOU
BUT IF THEY GOT AN IDEA OF IT ABOARD THE CUTTER SHE'D LAND SOME MEN SOMEHOW AND COME AND SEARCH ME BUT THEY WOULDN'T DARE TO COME AND SEARCH YOU I'VE GOT A BAD CHARACTER BUT YOU HAVEN'T
TO THE BLUE GREEN SOFTNESS OF THE EASTWARD HILLS THE LINE ON THE LONDON SIDE OF WOKING STATION WAS STILL UNDERGOING REPAIR SO I DESCENDED AT BYFLEET STATION AND TOOK THE ROAD TO MAYBURY
THENCE THE JOYFUL NEWS HAD FLASHED ALL OVER THE WORLD A THOUSAND CITIES CHILLED BY GHASTLY APPREHENSIONS SUDDENLY FLASHED INTO FRANTIC ILLUMINATIONS THEY KNEW OF IT IN DUBLIN EDINBURGH MANCHESTER BIRMINGHAM
ALL THAT I DID THAT DAY UNTIL THE TIME THAT I STOOD WEEPING AND PRAISING GOD UPON THE SUMMIT OF PRIMROSE HILL AND THEN I FORGET OF THE NEXT THREE DAYS I KNOW NOTHING I HAVE LEARNED SINCE THAT SO FAR FROM MY BEING THE FIRST DISCOVERER OF THE MARTIAN OVERTHROW
I YES MASTER SHACKLE SEE THE CUTTER I THINK I SAW A SMALL VESSEL LYING SOME DISTANCE OFF WITH WHITE SAILS THAT'S THE WHITE HAWK LUFF BROUGH
ONLY WE'RE FEARED HER LADYSHIP MIGHT THINK IT RUDE
THERE WERE STILL MANY BOURGEOIS ELEMENTS WHICH COULD STILL GO HAND IN HAND WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATS AND THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE OF THEIR CO OPERATION IT WAS NECESSARY TO ATTRACT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BOURGEOISIE INTO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE NEW MINISTRY
THE FOOD AND TRANSPORTATION SITUATIONS WERE BECOMING MORE AND MORE DISORGANIZED LOCAL CLASHES WERE GROWING MORE FREQUENT THE SOCIALISTIC MINISTERS WERE EXHORTING THE MASSES TO BE PATIENT ALL DECISIONS AND MEASURES
WE DEEM IT NECESSARY TO PRESENT AS THE FIRST ORDER OF THE DAY A QUESTION ON WHOSE SOLUTION DEPEND NOT ONLY ALL THE OTHER MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL BUT ACTUALLY AND LITERALLY THE FATE OF THE WHOLE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION
AMAZED AND AFRAID EVEN AS I STOOD AMAZED AND AFRAID WERE MY COUSIN AND MY WIFE MY WIFE WHITE AND TEARLESS SHE GAVE A FAINT CRY I CAME SHE SAID
OUR MUDDY FOOTSTEPS I SAW STILL WENT UP THE STAIRS I FOLLOWED THEM TO MY STUDY AND FOUND LYING ON MY WRITING TABLE STILL WITH THE SELENITE PAPER WEIGHT UPON IT THE SHEET OF WORK I HAD LEFT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE OPENING OF THE CYLINDER
TWO DAYS AFTER I WAS IMPRISONED IT HAD BEEN DESTROYED WITH EVERY SOUL IN IT BY A MARTIAN HE HAD SWEPT IT OUT OF EXISTENCE AS IT SEEMED WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION AS A BOY MIGHT CRUSH AN ANT HILL
BUT THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY THE DEMONSTRATION WAS LOST AS SOON AS IT WAS REPORTED FROM THE FRONT THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY HAD ADVANCED TO ATTACK THE ENEMY ON THE VERY DAY THAT THE WORKINGMEN AND THE PETROGRAD GARRISON DEMANDED THE PUBLICATION OF THE SECRET TREATIES
TRANSFIXED BY A STICK THAT KEPT IT IN PLACE IT WAS THE PLACARD OF THE FIRST NEWSPAPER TO RESUME PUBLICATION THE DAILY MAIL I BOUGHT A COPY FOR A BLACKENED SHILLING I FOUND IN MY POCKET
DOCTRINAIRISM OF FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY FOR COMPROMISING WITH THE UKRAINIANS ET CETERA ET CETERA THE TOTAL IMPRESSION WAS PITIFUL IN THE EXTREME THE HOPELESS DOCTRINAIRE OF THE COALITION GOVERNMENT
AND VERY PAINFUL TO THE EYE
AND I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO REPAY YOU TCHAH WHO WANTS REPAYING SIR RISDON WE HAVE PLENTY AT THE FARM
BUT SUFFICIENTLY AWAKE TO WHAT WAS AROUND TO MAKE HIM STOOP FROM TIME TO TIME TO PICK UP A GLISTENING WHITE TOPPED MUSHROOM
AFFILIATED WITH ENGLISH FRENCH AND AMERICAN IMPERIALISM AND THUS FREE THEM FROM THE NECESSITY OF RECKONING LATER WITH THE ORGANIZED WILL OF RUSSIAN DEMOCRACY THE SECRET COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY INSTIGATORS OF THE DRIVE
THESE PEOPLE WHOSE NAME MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THEM I MAY NOT EVEN GIVE HERE NEVERTHELESS CUMBERED THEMSELVES WITH ME SHELTERED ME AND PROTECTED ME FROM MYSELF
I LEARNED NOTHING FRESH EXCEPT THAT ALREADY IN ONE WEEK THE EXAMINATION OF THE MARTIAN MECHANISMS HAD YIELDED ASTONISHING RESULTS AMONG OTHER THINGS THE ARTICLE ASSURED ME WHAT I DID NOT BELIEVE AT THE TIME THAT THE SECRET OF FLYING WAS DISCOVERED
AT WATERLOO I FOUND THE FREE TRAINS THAT WERE TAKING PEOPLE TO THEIR HOMES THE FIRST RUSH WAS ALREADY OVER THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE IN THE TRAIN AND I WAS IN NO MOOD FOR CASUAL CONVERSATION I GOT A COMPARTMENT TO MYSELF
I WENT OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREETS THAT HAD LATELY BEEN SO DARK AND STRANGE AND EMPTY ALREADY THEY WERE BUSY WITH RETURNING PEOPLE IN PLACES EVEN THERE WERE SHOPS OPEN AND I SAW A DRINKING FOUNTAIN RUNNING WATER
A MAN STANDING AT AN OPEN COTTAGE DOOR GREETED ME BY NAME AS I PASSED I LOOKED AT MY HOUSE WITH A QUICK FLASH OF HOPE THAT FADED IMMEDIATELY THE DOOR HAD BEEN FORCED IT WAS UNFAST AND WAS OPENING SLOWLY AS I APPROACHED
WANT TO GROW INTO A JEMMY DADD NO FATHER THEN BE OFF
A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE DRIVE WE DECLARED THAT THE MILITARY ADVANCE WOULD INEVITABLY DESTROY ALL THE INTERNAL TIES WITHIN THE ARMY SET UP ITS VARIOUS PARTS ONE AGAINST THE OTHER AND TURN THE SCALES HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF THE COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS
IT'S A PITY TOO THE LATTER CONTINUED SPECIALLY AS WE OFTEN HAVE SO MUCH FISH WE PUTS IT ON THE LAND
WHO HAD TAKEN TO FISHING OR LIKE A FISHERMAN WHO HAD TAKEN TO FARMING AND HIS NAUTICAL APPEARANCE SEEMED STRANGE TO A MAN WHO WAS LEADING A VERY MEDITATIVE GREY HORSE ATTACHED TO A HEAVY CART
AND SAT WITH FOLDED ARMS LOOKING GREYLY AT THE SUNLIT DEVASTATION THAT FLOWED PAST THE WINDOWS AND JUST OUTSIDE THE TERMINUS THE TRAIN JOLTED OVER TEMPORARY RAILS AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RAILWAY THE HOUSES WERE BLACKENED RUINS
THE LAST REMARK CAME SO QUICKLY THAT THE HEARER STARTED AND MADE NO REPLY YOU SEE SIR RISDON WE MIGHT RUN THE CARGO AND STOW IT ALL UP AT MY PLACE FOR WE'VE PLENTY O ROOM
WERE SUCH AT THE TIME THAT THE SOVIET'S POWER AS A POLITICAL PARTY WOULD FALL NATURALLY INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOCIAL REVOLUTIONISTS AND THE MENSHEVIKI WE DELIBERATELY FACED THE SITUATION THANKS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF REELECTIONS AT ANY TIME
WHILE MASTER SHACKLE WENT ON CHUCKLING TO HIMSELF COULDN'T SAY ME NAY POOR FELLOW HALF STARVED THEY ARE SOMETIMES
SHOUTING TO GAUNT STARING FIGURES OF DESPAIR AND FOR THE FOOD ACROSS THE CHANNEL ACROSS THE IRISH SEA ACROSS THE ATLANTIC CORN BREAD AND MEAT WERE TEARING TO OUR RELIEF ALL THE SHIPPING IN THE WORLD SEEMED GOING LONDONWARD IN THOSE DAYS
THE MILITARY EVENTS WERE DEVELOPING AMID EVER INCREASING DIFFICULTIES IN THE INTERNAL LIFE OF THE NATION WITH REGARD TO THE LAND QUESTION INDUSTRIAL LIFE AND NATIONAL RELATIONS THE COALITION GOVERNMENT DID NOT TAKE A SINGLE RESOLUTE STEP FORWARD
AND WE FRANKLY SAID SO SHOULD TAKE THE GOVERNING POWER INTO THEIR OWN HANDS BUT EVEN AFTER THE MINISTERIAL CRISIS OF THE SECOND OF JULY
THE QUESTION OF THE MILITARY DRIVE WHICH IS BEING PLANNED FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE HAVING PUT THE PEOPLE AND THE ARMY WHICH DOES NOT KNOW IN THE NAME OF WHAT INTERNATIONAL ENDS IT IS CALLED UPON TO SHED ITS BLOOD FACE TO FACE WITH THE IMPENDING ATTACK
AY TO BE SURE SAID SHACKLE
BUT OF ALL THIS I HAVE NO MEMORY I DRIFTED A DEMENTED MAN I FOUND MYSELF IN A HOUSE OF KINDLY PEOPLE WHO HAD FOUND ME ON THE THIRD DAY WANDERING WEEPING AND RAVING THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAINT JOHN'S WOOD
FOR A TIME I STOOD REGARDING THESE VESTIGES THEN I RETURNED THROUGH THE PINE WOOD NECK HIGH WITH RED WEED HERE AND THERE TO FIND THE LANDLORD OF THE SPOTTED DOG HAD ALREADY FOUND BURIAL AND SO CAME HOME PAST THE COLLEGE ARMS
I TELL YOU IT'S SAFE ENOUGH YOU'VE ONLY TO LEAVE YOUR SIDE DOOR OPEN AND GO TO BED THAT'S ALL BUT I SHALL BE AS GUILTY AS YOU GUILTY THE MAN LAUGHED
THOSE RESULTS WHICH LATER CAME TO BE KNOWN COLLECTIVELY UNDER THE NAME OF KORNILOVISM WE BELIEVED THAT THE GREATEST DANGER THREATENED THE REVOLUTION IN EITHER CASE WHETHER THE DRIVE PROVED SUCCESSFUL WHICH WE DID NOT EXPECT OR MET WITH FAILURE
AH MASTER SHACKLE HE SAID STARTING SLIGHTLY ON BEING ADDRESSED WELL THANK YOU A LOVELY MORNING INDEED
THE CHURCH BELLS THAT HAD CEASED A FORTNIGHT SINCE SUDDENLY CAUGHT THE NEWS UNTIL ALL ENGLAND WAS BELL RINGING MEN ON CYCLES LEAN FACED UNKEMPT SCORCHED ALONG EVERY COUNTRY LANE SHOUTING OF UNHOPED DELIVERANCE
AND A SHALLOW TRACK FORMED BY HORSES HOOFS THE SAID CHANNELS BEING MORE OFTEN FULL OF WATER THAN OF MUD AND BOASTING THE QUALITY OF NEVER EVEN IN THE HOTTEST WEATHER BEING DRY
INCLUDING THE CALLING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WERE BEING POSTPONED THE INSOLVENCY AND THE INSTABILITY OF THE COALITION REGIME WERE OBVIOUS THERE WERE TWO POSSIBLE WAYS OUT
TO THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS AND MENSHEVIKI IN CONTROL OF THE SOVIET PARTIES
WITH ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES THE COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY CIRCLES OF RUSSIA ARE COUNTING ON THE FACT THAT THIS DRIVE WILL NECESSITATE A CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE MILITARY DIPLOMATIC AND CAPITALISTIC GROUPS
CHAPTER THREE HOW DO SIR RISDON THE SPEAKER WAS A CURIOUS LOOKING MAN OF FIFTY ROUGH SUNBURNED AND EVIDENTLY AS KEEN AS A WELL WORN KNIFE HE WAS DRESSED LIKE A FARMER
I DON BELIEVE SHE'D LIKE HER FATHER TO MISS GETTING A LOT OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR HIM AND YOUR MADAM THERE SIR RISDON DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT
NEVER FEEL SHAMED TO LOOK MY BOY RAMILLIES IN THE FACE IF A BIT O SMUGGLING WAS WRONG SIR RISDON THINK I'D DO IT NO SIR I THINK O THEM AS WAS BEFORE ME MY FATHER WAS IN MARLBOROUGH'S WARS
AND HAD TO BE CHECKED NOT THE KING'S LAWS BUT THE LAWS OF THAT DUTCHMAN WHO HAS COME AND STUCK HIMSELF ON THE THRONE
HOPE HE WON'T THEM CELLARS ARE TOO VALLYBLE HALLO WHAT NOW
WAS STUDDED WITH EXCITED GROUPS IN WHICH ARMY OFFICERS JOURNALISTS AND WELL DRESSED LADIES WERE CARRYING ON A BITTER CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI THE FIRST REPORTS OF THE MILITARY DRIVE WERE FAVORABLE THE LEADING LIBERAL PAPERS
RECEIVE A GREATER FOLLOWING IN THE SOVIET ORGANIZATIONS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE PROLETARIAT'S STRUGGLE FOR POWER WOULD NATURALLY MOVE IN THE CHANNEL OF SOVIET ORGANIZATIONS AND COULD TAKE A MORE NORMAL COURSE
SINCE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE IN A DEMORALIZED ARMY AN ARMY DEVOID OF CONTROLLING IDEAS WITHOUT RECOURSE TO SEVERE REPRESSIVE MEASURES IN OTHER WORDS WE FORETOLD IN THIS DECLARATION
NOT A BIT SAID THE FISHER FARMER WITH A CHUCKLE YOU'RE WELCOME SQUIRE I THANK YOU MASTER SHACKLE I THANK YOU WARMLY YOU SEE HER LADYSHIP IS VERY FOND
AND TAKE TWO ROLLS OF BUTTER A BIT OF HONEY AND A COUPLE OF CHICKENS UP TO THE HOZE YES FATHER
THERE'S A THREE MASTED LUGGER COMING OVER FROM USHANT AND SHE MAY BE IN TO NIGHT THERE'S SOME NICE THICK FOGS ABOUT NOW AND IT'S A QUIET SEA YOUR CELLARS ARE QUITE EMPTY I S'POSE
THE NEWS OF VICTORY DID NOT LAST LONG IT WAS SOON REPLACED BY GLOOMY REPORTS OF THE REFUSAL OF MANY REGIMENTS TO SUPPORT THE ADVANCING COLUMNS OF THE GREAT LOSSES IN COMMANDING OFFICERS WHO SOMETIMES COMPOSED THE WHOLE OF THE ATTACKING UNITS ET CETERA
HAVING BROKEN WITH THE BOURGEOISIE THE MIDDLE CLASS DEMOCRACY WOULD ITSELF FALL UNDER THEIR BAN AND WOULD BE COMPELLED TO SEEK A CLOSER UNION WITH THE SOCIALISTIC PROLETARIAT IN THIS WAY
YES FATHER BUT WELL THINK THE LUGGER WILL COME TO NIGHT NO I DON'T THINK ANYTHING AND DON'T YOU WILL YOU KEEP THAT RATTLE TONGUE OF YOURS QUIET
WALTON BY VIRTUE OF ITS UNBURNED PINE WOODS SEEMED THE LEAST HURT OF ANY PLACE ALONG THE LINE
THEY DID ALL THEY COULD TO DIVERT ME FROM THIS MORBIDITY BUT AT LAST I COULD RESIST THE IMPULSE NO LONGER AND PROMISING FAITHFULLY TO RETURN TO THEM AND PARTING AS I WILL CONFESS FROM THESE FOUR DAY FRIENDS WITH TEARS
WHY SIR YOU OUGHT TO TAKE A PLEASURE IN BREAKING HIS LAWS AFTER THE WAY HE HAS ROBBED YOU AND TURNED YOU FROM A REAL GENTLEMAN INTO A POOR HARD PRESSED COUNTRY SQUIRE WHO HUSH HUSH MASTER SHACKLE SAID THE TALL GENTLEMAN HUSKILY
THE RATS TELL EM TO TAKE NO NOTICE SIR RISDON GOOD DAY SIR RISDON THAT'S SETTLED THEN
AH MASTER SHACKLE I'M LOSING HEART NAY DON'T DO THAT SIR RISDON AND AS TO A FEW MUSHROOMS WHY YOU'RE WELCOME ENOUGH AND I'D OFTEN BE SENDING A CHICKEN OR A FEW EGGS OR A KIT O BUTTER
THE PERSON BLENHEIM SHACKLE FARMER AND FISHER IN HIS CANVAS SAILOR'S BREECHES BIG BOOTS STRIPED SHIRT AND RED TASSEL CAP HAD ACCOSTED WAS A TALL THIN ARISTOCRATIC LOOKING GENTLEMAN
AND AN OPEN OFFER OF PEACE KERENSKY FLUNG THE REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS INTO BATTLE THIS WAS NO MERE COINCIDENCE TO BE SURE THE PROJECTORS HAD EVERYTHING PREPARED IN ADVANCE AND THE TIME OF ATTACK WAS DETERMINED NOT BY MILITARY
DON'T RAKE UP MY MISFORTUNES NOT I SIR RISDON I'M FULL O SORROW AND RESPECT FOR A NOBLE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS SUFFERED FOR THE CAUSE OF THE REAL KING WHO WHEN HE COMES WILL SET US ALL RIGHT
YOU WILL SIR RISDON NO NO I DARE NOT AND IT GIVES A NEIGHBOUR A CHANCE TO BEG YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF A LITTLE DROP O REAL COGNAC SIR RISDON SO GOOD IN CASE O SICKNESS
THAT IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT ANY GREAT PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION COULD HAVE BEEN SLAIN BUT THEN I NOTICED HOW YELLOW WERE THE SKINS OF THE PEOPLE I MET HOW SHAGGY THE HAIR OF THE MEN HOW LARGE AND BRIGHT THEIR EYES
I SAW LITTLE OF THE MISCHIEF WROUGHT BY THE MARTIANS UNTIL I REACHED WELLINGTON STREET AND THERE I SAW THE RED WEED CLAMBERING OVER THE BUTTRESSES OF WATERLOO BRIDGE AT THE CORNER OF THE BRIDGE TOO I SAW ONE OF THE COMMON CONTRASTS OF THAT GROTESQUE TIME
AN UNSUCCESSFUL DRIVE WAS LIKELY TO DEMORALIZE THE ARMY COMPLETELY TO INVOLVE A GENERAL RETREAT AND THE LOSS OF MUCH ADDITIONAL TERRITORY AND TO BRING DISGUST AND DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE PEOPLE EVENTS TOOK THE LATTER COURSE
THE LADS COULD RUN IT UP THE VALLEY AND DOWN INTO YOUR CELLAR SIR RISDON WHISPERED THE MAN AS IF AFRAID THAT THE OLD GREY HORSE WOULD HEAR NOBODY WOULD BE A BIT THE WISER AND YOU'D BE DOING A NEIGHBOUR A GOOD TURN
THIS ONCE ONLY MASTER SHACKLE THANK YE SIR RISDON SAID THE MAN JEE DUTCHMAN THE HORSE TUGGED AT THE TUMBRIL AND SIR RISDON WENT THOUGHTFULLY ALONG THE FIELD TOWARD A CLUMP OF TREES LYING IN A HOLLOW
REGARDLESS OF ITS ULTIMATE MILITARY RESULTS WOULD DEAL A MORTAL BLOW TO THE REVOLUTION RESTORE THE ARMY'S FORMER DISCIPLINE AND ASSURE THE LIBERAL BOURGEOISIE OF A COMMANDING POSITION IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT WE HOWEVER
OF THE MIDDLE CLASS DEMOCRATIC ELEMENTS WOULD BE OVERCOME SOONER OR LATER BY THE WORKING MASSES WITH THE HELP OF OUR CRITICISM THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE DEMANDED THAT THE LEADING SOVIET PARTIES IN WHICH WE HAD NO REAL CONFIDENCE
I WAS STARTLED HAD I SPOKEN MY THOUGHT ALOUD I TURNED AND THE FRENCH WINDOW WAS OPEN BEHIND ME I MADE A STEP TO IT AND STOOD LOOKING OUT AND THERE
IN APPEARANCE BETWEEN BUTCHER'S MEAT AND PICKLED CABBAGE THE SURREY PINE WOODS WERE TOO DRY HOWEVER FOR THE FESTOONS OF THE RED CLIMBER BEYOND WIMBLEDON WITHIN SIGHT OF THE LINE IN CERTAIN NURSERY GROUNDS
IN A BROAD SKIRTED SHABBY BROWN VELVET COAT WHO WAS DAINTILY PICKING HIS WAY CANE IN HAND OVER THE SOFT TURF OF THE FIELD
CHAPTER NINE WRECKAGE AND NOW COMES THE STRANGEST THING IN MY STORY YET PERHAPS IT IS NOT ALTOGETHER STRANGE I REMEMBER CLEARLY AND COLDLY AND VIVIDLY
AND A LENGTH OR TWO OF FRENCH SILK MASTER SHACKLE MASTER SHACKLE CRIED THE TALL THIN BARONET PITEOUSLY HOW CAN YOU TEMPT A POOR SUFFERING GENTLEMAN LIKE THIS
DAN ALREADY ENTERTAINED HOPES OF A RADICAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO BE HASTILY BUILT UP AT THE TIME BY A FEW PRO DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS THE REPORT THAT THE COALITION GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN UP
THE SOVIET MINISTERS CAME TO REPORT A NEW CRISIS IN THE GOVERNMENT WE WERE INTENSELY INTERESTED TO LEARN WHAT POSITION THEY WOULD TAKE NOW THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY GONE TO PIECES UNDER THE GREAT ORDEALS ARISING FROM COALITION POLICIES
ON THE SECOND OF JULY CAME A CRISIS IN THE MINISTRY THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF WHICH WAS THE UKRAINIAN QUESTION
I HAVE PICKED A FEW SAID THE TALL THIN GENTLEMAN COLOURING SLIGHTLY I BEG YOUR PARDON MASTER SHACKLE FOR DOING SO I OUGHT TO HAVE ASKED YOUR LEAVE
ARE CONSCIOUSLY TRYING TO PLAY ON THE DEMORALIZATION IN THE ARMY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY AND TO THIS END ARE INSPIRING THE DISCOURAGED ELEMENTS WITH THE FALLACIOUS IDEA THAT THE VERY FACT OF A DRIVE CAN REHABILITATE THE ARMY
WHICH SEEMED TO US ALMOST INEVITABLE A SUCCESSFUL MILITARY ADVANCE WOULD HAVE UNITED THE MIDDLE CLASS AND THE BOURGEOISIE IN THEIR COMMON CHAUVINISTIC TENDENCIES THUS ISOLATING THE REVOLUTIONARY PROLETARIAT
CLUNG TO A MIDDLE COURSE AND ONLY MUDDLED MATTERS THE MORE
AND LET ME HAVE YOUR BILL BY AND BY I SHOULD BE GRATIFIED ON'Y TOO GLAD SIR RISDON I WILL THINK ANY ONE'S BEEN TELLING TALES TALES BOUT US SIR RISDON
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN AND GO TO BED YOU SHAN'T HEAR ANYBODY COME OR GO AWAY AND YOU'RE NOT OBLIGED TO LOOK IN THE CELLARS FOR A FEW DAYS
THEY HAVE TOLD ME SINCE THAT I WAS SINGING SOME INSANE DOGGEREL ABOUT THE LAST MAN LEFT ALIVE HURRAH THE LAST MAN LEFT ALIVE
BUT I SHALL BE AFRAID TO LOOK IN THE FACE OF MY DEAR CHILD
THE MECHANISM OF THE SOVIETS ASSURED A SUFFICIENTLY EXACT REFLECTION OF THE PROGRESSIVE SHIFT TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE MASSES OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS AFTER THE BREAK OF THE COALITION WITH THE BOURGEOISIE THE RADICAL TENDENCIES SHOULD WE EXPECTED
AT THE TIME WHEN I STOOD UPON THE VERGE OF THE PIT ALREADY MEN WEEPING WITH JOY AS I HAVE HEARD SHOUTING AND STAYING THEIR WORK TO SHAKE HANDS AND SHOUT WERE MAKING UP TRAINS EVEN AS NEAR AS CREWE TO DESCEND UPON LONDON
CONSIDERED THAT THE PRINCIPAL AIM HAD BEEN ATTAINED
ONLY TO BE REPLACED BY A NEW COALITION SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH PETROGRAD AND PROVOKED A STORM OF INDIGNATION AMONG THE WORKINGMEN AND SOLDIERS EVERYWHERE
THE SENTENCE ENDED ABRUPTLY I REMEMBERED MY INABILITY TO FIX MY MIND THAT MORNING SCARCELY A MONTH GONE BY AND HOW I HAD BROKEN OFF TO GET MY DAILY CHRONICLE FROM THE NEWSBOY I REMEMBERED HOW I WENT DOWN TO THE GARDEN GATE AS HE CAME ALONG
NECESSARILY SO SAID I NO RULE WOULD SEEM HAPPY IF IT WERE A YOKE IMPOSED ON RELUCTANT WILLS AND NOT THE SAFE KEEPING OF OBEDIENT SUBJECTS THERE IS NOTHING THEN WHICH
OF WHAT ACCOUNT IS MY HAPPINESS ANSWERED HE I HAVE LONG CEASED TO STRIVE ANY MORE FOR HAPPINESS I STRIVE FOR MY WORK O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THE ANIMALS ONCE MORE
I FOUND AMONGST A NUMBER OF OTHER PLANTS OF SIMILAR HEIGHT ONE THAT WAS DARK IN COLOR WITH TIGHTLY CLOSED LEAVES
EVERY ONE OF THEM ALIKE STANDING THERE SO ERECT AND BEARING THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE EAR
YOU CAN'T MAKE US BELIEVE THAT FOXES AND WOLVES AND RAVENS ARE ABLE TO TALK WE'VE GOT BEYOND STORIES OF THAT KIND IN THESE YOUNG HOPEFULS YOU HAVE THE ENLIGHTENED RATIONALISTS OF THE FUTURE
OVERWHELMED BY AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF LITTLE MEN A MOTHER GAVE HER CHILDREN AESOP'S FABLES TO READ IN THE HOPE OF EDUCATING AND IMPROVING THEIR MINDS
HE WILL NEED NO EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE RULING OF THE WORLD OTHERWISE IF HE STANDS IN NEED OF AUGHT HE WILL NOT POSSESS COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE THAT IS NECESSARILY SO SAID I THEN
FALLS CROUCHING AT HIS FEET THE DREAD AVENGERS TOO THAT GUILTY MINDS PURSUE WITH EVER HAUNTING FEARS ARE ALL DISSOLVED IN TEARS IXION ON HIS WHEEL A RESPITE
THERE BREATHED ALL TENDER THINGS UPON HIS SOUNDING STRINGS EACH RHAPSODY HIGH WROUGHT HIS GODDESS MOTHER TAUGHT ALL HE FROM GRIEF COULD BORROW AND LOVE REDOUBLING SORROW TILL
BUT SEE THAT HONEY IS THERE READY TO HAND YELLOW WHITE GOOD ICE COOL GOLDEN COMB HONEY FOR KNOW THAT WHEN ALOFT I WILL MAKE THE HONEY SACRIFICE
AND HE HEEDED IT NOT HIS HAIR HOWEVER BECAME WHITE ONE DAY WHEN HE SAT ON A STONE IN FRONT OF HIS CAVE AND GAZED CALMLY INTO THE DISTANCE ONE THERE GAZETH
YOU HAVE THE ASTRONOMER AND THE PHILOSOPHER WISDOM WHICH IS ONLY THEORETICAL AND NEVER PUT INTO PRACTICE IS LIKE A DOUBLE ROSE
LOOK AT THE THOUSANDS OF GAY BLOSSOMS WHICH COVER ME EVERYWHERE SAID THE APPLE TREE WHAT HAVE YOU TO SHOW IN COMPARISON DARK GREEN NEEDLES THAT IS TRUE REPLIED THE FIR
EVEN BEFORE HE COMES NEAR THEM THE FLY LIGHTS UPON HIS VERY NOSE TWO CHINAMEN TRAVELING IN EUROPE WENT TO THE THEATRE FOR THE FIRST TIME
THEN HE LAUGHED FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART LOOKED AROUND HIM AND SPAKE THUS THAT I SPAKE OF SACRIFICES AND HONEY SACRIFICES IT WAS MERELY A RUSE IN TALKING AND VERILY
THE FLY SHOULD BE USED AS THE SYMBOL OF IMPERTINENCE AND AUDACITY FOR WHILST ALL OTHER ANIMALS SHUN MAN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND RUN AWAY
A LITTLE BEFORE THOU DIDST BEGIN WITH HAPPINESS AND SAY IT WAS THE SUPREME GOOD AND DIDST DECLARE IT TO BE SEATED IN THE SUPREME GODHEAD GOD HIMSELF TOO
BUT LET US GIVE OUR ATTENTION TO THE TASK THAT WE HAVE SET BEFORE OURSELVES HAVE WE NOT COUNTED INDEPENDENCE IN THE CATEGORY OF HAPPINESS AND AGREED THAT GOD IS ABSOLUTE HAPPINESS TRULY WE HAVE THEN
IT OUGHT TO EXIST FOR ITS OWN SAKE ALONE BUT BEFORE VERY LONG IT IS MISUSED TO SERVE ALIEN ENDS
THIS IS ESPECIALLY ILLUSTRATED AND CORROBORATED IN THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONS WHETHER GREAT OR SMALL WEALTHY OR POOR FOUNDED NO MATTER IN WHAT CENTURY OR IN WHAT LAND TO MAINTAIN AND ADVANCE HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
A NUMBER OF PORCUPINES HUDDLED TOGETHER FOR WARMTH ON A COLD DAY IN WINTER BUT AS THEY BEGAN TO PRICK ONE ANOTHER WITH THEIR QUILLS
IT IS NOT LONG BEFORE PEOPLE SNEAK UP TO THEM UNDER THE PRETENCE OF WISHING TO FURTHER THOSE SPECIAL ENDS WHILE THEY ARE REALLY LED ON BY THE DESIRE TO SECURE THE EMOLUMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN LEFT FOR THEIR FURTHERANCE
MY HAPPINESS ITSELF DO I THROW OUT INTO ALL PLACES FAR AND WIDE TWIXT ORIENT NOONTIDE AND OCCIDENT
IN BODY LIKE TO A SPHERE ON ALL SIDES PERFECTLY ROUNDED IT ROLLS THE RESTLESS ORB OF THE UNIVERSE KEEPING ITSELF MOTIONLESS THE WHILE
IN THE SAME WAY THE NEED OF SOCIETY DRIVES THE HUMAN PORCUPINES TOGETHER ONLY TO BE MUTUALLY REPELLED BY THE MANY PRICKLY AND DISAGREEABLE QUALITIES OF THEIR NATURE
WHICH ONLY THOSE WILL UNDERSTAND WHO FEEL THE TRUTH OF IT YOUR ESTIMATION OF A MAN'S SIZE WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE DISTANCE AT WHICH YOU STAND FROM HIM
WOE UNTO ALL LOVING ONES WHO HAVE NOT AN ELEVATION WHICH IS ABOVE THEIR PITY THUS SPAKE THE DEVIL UNTO ME ONCE ON A TIME
NO ONE AT ALL CAN QUESTION IT WHO THINKS CONSISTENTLY NOW THERE IS NOTHING WHICH ONE WHO IS ALL POWERFUL CANNOT DO NOTHING BUT CAN GOD DO EVIL THEN
PREFERS TO REMAIN OUTSIDE WHERE HE WILL NEITHER PRICK OTHER PEOPLE
RICH SEA A SEA FULL OF MANY HUED FISHES AND CRABS FOR WHICH EVEN THE GODS MIGHT LONG AND MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO BECOME FISHERS IN IT AND CASTERS OF NETS
WEAVING A LABYRINTH OF TANGLED ARGUMENTS NOW SEEMING TO BEGIN WHERE THOU DIDST END AND NOW TO END WHERE THOU DIDST BEGIN OR DOST THOU BUILD UP SOME WONDROUS CIRCLE OF DIVINE SIMPLICITY FOR TRULY
EVEN NOW A CHILD OF NATURE SOMETIMES SEES THEM SOME ONE WHO HAS NOT ANTICIPATED HIS AESTHETIC PLEASURES BY THE HELP OF ART OR TAKEN THE CHARMS OF LIFE TOO EARLY
FOR THAT DO I WAIT THE WICKEDEST OF ALL FISH CATCHERS OUT OUT MY FISHING HOOK IN AND DOWN THOU BAIT OF MY HAPPINESS DRIP THY SWEETEST DEW
AND ABOVE ME WHAT ROSY RED STILLNESS
THEN HE DISPOSES ALL THINGS BY THE AGENCY OF GOOD IF IT BE TRUE THAT HE RULES ALL THINGS BY HIS OWN POWER WHOM WE HAVE AGREED TO BE GOOD AND HE IS AS IT WERE THE RUDDER AND HELM BY WHICH THE WORLD'S MECHANISM IS KEPT STEADY AND IN ORDER
BUT LET HIM ALONE HE WILL NOT DIE TIME WILL COME AND BRING THOSE WHO KNOW HOW TO VALUE HIM
AS A CHILD AS A YOUTH OFTEN EVEN AS A FULL GROWN MAN NAY HIS WHOLE LIFE LONG HE GOES ABOUT AMONG HIS FELLOWS LOOKING LIKE THEM AND SEEMINGLY AS UNIMPORTANT
I DO NOT THINK IT DOUBTFUL NOW NOR SHALL I EVER AND BY WHAT REASONS I AM BROUGHT TO THIS ASSURANCE I WILL BRIEFLY SET FORTH
BUT THEY VERY SOON BROUGHT THE BOOK BACK AND THE ELDEST WISE BEYOND HIS YEARS DELIVERED HIMSELF AS FOLLOWS THIS IS NO BOOK FOR US IT'S MUCH TOO CHILDISH AND STUPID
OF MUTUAL COLLISION IT MAY BE FROM THE IMPACT SOME FAIR SPARK OF TRUTH MAY BE STRUCK OUT IF IT BE THY GOOD PLEASURE SAID I NO ONE CAN DOUBT THAT GOD IS ALL POWERFUL
SATED AND PACIFIED AT LENGTH THE SHADOWY KING HIS SORROWS PITYING HE HATH PREVAILED CRIED WE GIVE HIM BACK HIS BRIDE TO HIM SHE SHALL BELONG
WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER WAS ALOFT ON THE SUMMIT HE SENT HIS ANIMALS HOME THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM AND FOUND THAT HE WAS NOW ALONE
I CALL BY THE NAME WHICH ALL RECOGNISE GOD THEN SAID SHE SEEING THAT SUCH IS THY BELIEF IT WILL COST ME LITTLE TROUBLE I THINK TO ENABLE THEE TO WIN HAPPINESS AND RETURN IN SAFETY TO THY OWN COUNTRY
FOR THIS AM I FROM THE HEART AND FROM THE BEGINNING DRAWING HITHER DRAWING UPWARD DRAWING UPBRINGING A DRAWER A TRAINER A TRAINING MASTER
LONG BEFORE WE ENTER UPON LIFE ITSELF AND WHEN AFTERWARDS WE COME TO SEE THE WORKS OF NATURE FOR OURSELVES THE VARNISH IS GONE THE ARTISTS HAVE USED IT UP AND WE HAVE ENJOYED IT IN ADVANCE
SO WILL IT BE O ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED HIS ANIMALS AND PRESSED UP TO HIM BUT WILT THOU NOT TO DAY ASCEND A HIGH MOUNTAIN THE AIR IS PURE
THE MAN WHO GOES UP IN A BALLOON DOES NOT FEEL AS THOUGH HE WERE ASCENDING HE ONLY SEES THE EARTH SINKING DEEPER UNDER HIM THERE IS A MYSTERY
ITS COLOR AND PERFUME ARE DELIGHTFUL BUT IT WITHERS AWAY AND LEAVES NO SEED NO ROSE WITHOUT A THORN YES BUT MANY A THORN WITHOUT A ROSE
IS THE CODE OF POLITENESS AND FINE MANNERS AND THOSE WHO TRANSGRESS IT ARE ROUGHLY TOLD IN THE ENGLISH PHRASE TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE BY THIS ARRANGEMENT
SUFFERED TO REMAIN ONLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO GETTING RID OF THEM AND YET BUT FOR THESE FLOWERS THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO CHARM THE EYE IN THAT WILDERNESS OF STALKS THEY ARE EMBLEMATIC OF
ONCE ON A TIME BECOME WHAT THOU ART THUS MAY MEN NOW COME UP TO ME FOR AS YET DO I AWAIT THE SIGNS THAT IT IS TIME FOR MY DOWN GOING
RED AND BLUE AND VIOLET HOW PRETTY THEY LOOKED AS THEY GREW THERE SO NATURALLY WITH THEIR LITTLE FOLIAGE BUT THOUGHT I THEY ARE QUITE USELESS THEY BEAR NO FRUIT THEY ARE MERE WEEDS
OF HIS SONG ONE SOLE CONDITION YET UPON THE BOON IS SET LET HIM NOT TURN HIS EYES TO VIEW HIS HARD WON PRIZE TILL THEY SECURELY PASS THE GATES OF HELL ALAS WHAT LAW
THOU DIDST UNFOLD WITHOUT THE HELP OF ASSUMPTIONS FROM WITHOUT BUT BY INHERENT AND PROPER PROOFS DRAWING CREDENCE ONE FROM THE OTHER THEN ANSWERED SHE FAR IS IT FROM ME TO MOCK THEE NAY
ALTHOUGH I NOW ANTICIPATE WHAT THOU INTENDEST I HAVE A DESIRE TO HEAR THE ARGUMENT PLAINLY SET FORTH AWHILE AGO THOU DEEMEDST IT BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT GOD DOTH GOVERN THE WORLD
AND CHARACTER UNLESS THERE WERE ONE WHO HIMSELF ABIDING DISPOSED THESE VARIOUS VICISSITUDES OF CHANGE THIS POWER WHATSOEVER IT BE WHEREBY THEY REMAIN AS THEY WERE CREATED AND ARE KEPT IN MOTION
THE VULTURE TOO DOTH SPARE SOME LITTLE WHILE TO TEAR
TO HEAR THE PLAINTIVE STRAIN THE WOODS MOVED IN HIS TRAIN AND THE STREAM CEASED TO FLOW HELD BY SO SOFT A
AND TO DAY ONE SEETH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN EVER YEA MINE ANIMALS ANSWERED HE YE COUNSEL ADMIRABLY AND ACCORDING TO MY HEART I WILL TO DAY ASCEND A HIGH MOUNTAIN
IN HIS OWN BOSOM RAGED THE MUSIC THAT COULD CALM ALL ELSE BROUGHT HIM NO BALM CHIDING THE POWERS IMMORTAL HE CAME UNTO HELL'S PORTAL
FOR IN A WORLD OF NEED AND IMPERFECTION EVERYTHING IS SEIZED UPON WHICH CAN BE USED TO SATISFY WANT NOTHING IS EXEMPT FROM THIS SERVICE NO
IT IS HIS LOVE FOR MAN AND LATELY
NOT THAT I WOULD HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST SUCH WRATHFUL ONES ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY ARE WELL ENOUGH FOR LAUGHTER TO ME IMPATIENT MUST THEY NOW BE THOSE BIG ALARM DRUMS WHICH FIND A VOICE NOW OR NEVER
UNTIL BITING AT MY SHARP HIDDEN HOOKS THEY HAVE TO COME UP UNTO MY HEIGHT THE MOTLEYEST ABYSS GROUNDLINGS TO THE WICKEDEST OF ALL FISHERS OF MEN
SAID SHE IT IS THE SUPREME GOOD WHICH RULES IN STRENGTH AND GRACIOUSLY DISPOSES ALL THINGS THEN SAID I HOW DELIGHTED AM I AT THY REASONINGS AND THE CONCLUSION TO WHICH THOU HAST BROUGHT THEM
ERSTWHILE THOU DIDST CONFESS THYSELF IGNORANT WHAT IS THAT SAID I THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WORLD'S GOVERNMENT SAID SHE YES I REMEMBER MY CONFESSION AND
OUT ON THE SEA AND AWAY BEYOND SINUOUS ABYSSES THEN WENT HIS ANIMALS THOUGHTFULLY ROUND ABOUT HIM AND AT LAST SET THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF HIM
A WIDE SPREADING APPLE TREE STOOD IN FULL BLOOM AND BEHIND IT A STRAIGHT FIR RAISED ITS DARK AND TAPERING HEAD
WHEN I TOUCHED IT IT SAID TO ME IN FIRM TONES LET ME ALONE I AM NOT FOR YOUR COLLECTION LIKE THESE PLANTS TO WHICH NATURE HAS GIVEN ONLY A SINGLE YEAR OF LIFE I AM A LITTLE OAK
THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DISPERSE HOWEVER THE COLD DROVE THEM TOGETHER AGAIN WHEN JUST THE SAME THING HAPPENED AT LAST AFTER MANY TURNS OF HUDDLING AND DISPERSING
BUT WHEN WINTER COMES YOU WILL BE BARED OF YOUR GLORY AND I SHALL BE AS I AM NOW ONCE AS I WAS BOTANIZING UNDER AN OAK
OR DOTH IT SIT BEHIND A BIG STONE AND CATCH FLIES AND VERILY I AM WELL DISPOSED TO MINE ETERNAL FATE BECAUSE IT DOTH NOT HOUND AND HURRY ME BUT LEAVETH ME TIME FOR MERRIMENT AND MISCHIEF
UNTO WHICH ALL WINDS COME AS UNTO THE STORM PARTING ASKING WHERE AND WHENCE AND WHITHER HERE LAUGH LAUGH MY HEARTY HEALTHY WICKEDNESS FROM HIGH MOUNTAINS CAST DOWN THY GLITTERING SCORN LAUGHTER
WITHOUT DISMAY BESIDE THE LION LAY THE HOUND BY SONG SUBDUED NO MORE THE HARE PURSUED
NOT EVEN THOSE VERY THINGS WHICH ARISE ONLY WHEN NEED AND WANT ARE FOR A MOMENT LOST SIGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE TRUE SOUGHT FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
SO RICH IS THE WORLD IN WONDERFUL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL ESPECIALLY THE HUMAN WORLD THE HUMAN SEA TOWARDS IT DO I NOW THROW OUT MY GOLDEN ANGLE ROD AND SAY OPEN UP
CAN LOVERS MOVE A HIGHER LAW IS LOVE FOR ORPHEUS WOE IS ME
NAY BY NO MEANS THEN EVIL IS NOTHING SAID SHE SINCE HE TO WHOM NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IS UNABLE TO DO EVIL ART THOU MOCKING ME SAID I
BESIDE THE FOUNT OF GOOD BLEST HE WHOSE WILL COULD BREAK EARTH'S CHAINS FOR WISDOM'S SAKE THE THRACIAN BARD TIS SAID MOURNED HIS DEAR CONSORT DEAD
THUS IT IS THAT THE WORLD SO OFTEN APPEARS HARSH AND DEVOID OF CHARM NAY ACTUALLY REPULSIVE IT WERE BETTER TO LEAVE US TO DISCOVER THE VARNISH FOR OURSELVES THIS WOULD MEAN
THOU HUMAN ABYSS OPEN UP AND THROW UNTO ME THY FISH AND SHINING CRABS WITH MY BEST BAIT SHALL I ALLURE TO MYSELF TO DAY THE STRANGEST HUMAN FISH
ONE OF THEM DID NOTHING BUT STUDY THE MACHINERY AND HE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT HOW IT WAS WORKED THE OTHER TRIED TO GET AT THE MEANING OF THE PIECE IN SPITE OF HIS IGNORANCE OF THE LANGUAGE HERE
HEARTILY DO I AGREE AND INDEED I ANTICIPATED WHAT THOU WOULDST SAY THOUGH IT MAY BE IN FEEBLE SURMISE ONLY I WELL BELIEVE IT SAID SHE FOR AS I THINK
THOU NOW BRINGEST TO THE SEARCH EYES QUICKER IN DISCERNING TRUTH BUT WHAT I SHALL SAY NEXT IS NO LESS PLAIN AND EASY TO SEE WHAT IS IT SAID I WHY SAID SHE
BY THE BLESSING OF GOD WHOM WE LATELY ADDRESSED IN PRAYER
THAT IS TO SAY OUR GREAT REMOTE HUMAN KINGDOM THE ZARATHUSTRA KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS HOW REMOTE MAY SUCH REMOTENESS BE WHAT DOTH IT CONCERN ME
AS YET DO I NOT MYSELF GO DOWN AS I MUST DO AMONGST MEN THEREFORE DO I HERE WAIT CRAFTY AND SCORNFUL UPON HIGH MOUNTAINS NO IMPATIENT ONE
AND WHEN IT HAD ONCE COME TOGETHER
A SQUANDERER WITH A THOUSAND HANDS HOW COULD I CALL THAT SACRIFICING AND WHEN I DESIRED HONEY I ONLY DESIRED BAIT AND SWEET MUCUS AND MUCILAGE
SO THAT I HAVE TO DAY ASCENDED THIS HIGH MOUNTAIN TO CATCH FISH DID EVER ANY ONE CATCH FISH UPON HIGH MOUNTAINS AND THOUGH IT BE A FOLLY WHAT I HERE SEEK AND DO
A FEW PARABLES IN A FIELD OF RIPENING CORN I CAME TO A PLACE WHICH HAD BEEN TRAMPLED DOWN BY SOME RUTHLESS FOOT
FOR ONE DAY MUST IT YET COME AND MAY NOT PASS BY WHAT MUST ONE DAY COME AND MAY NOT PASS BY OUR GREAT HAZAR
AND WILL NOT LEAVE ME AND IS LIKE MOLTEN PITCH THEN WENT HIS ANIMALS AGAIN THOUGHTFULLY AROUND HIM AND PLACED THEMSELVES ONCE MORE IN FRONT OF HIM O ZARATHUSTRA SAID THEY
AND OF HAPPINESS AND DIDST TEACH THAT THE ABSOLUTE ONE WAS THE ABSOLUTE GOOD WHICH WAS SOUGHT BY UNIVERSAL NATURE
AND THE MANY AND IF IN THE END HE LOSES ALL PATIENCE HE CRUSHES BOTH THEM AND HIMSELF OR HE IS LIKE GULLIVER AT LILLIPUT
TAKES VERY DIFFERENT SHAPES ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AT BOTTOM HE IS A MAN WHO CARES NOTHING ABOUT KNOWLEDGE FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND ONLY STRIVES TO GAIN THE SEMBLANCE OF IT THAT HE MAY USE IT FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL ENDS
PAINTERS AND POETS LAY THEMSELVES OUT TO TAKE OFF THIS VARNISH TO STORE IT UP AND GIVE IT US TO BE ENJOYED AT OUR LEISURE WE DRINK DEEP OF THIS BEAUTY
FOURTH AND LAST PART AH WHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE THERE BEEN GREATER FOLLIES THAN WITH THE PITIFUL AND WHAT IN THE WORLD HATH CAUSED MORE SUFFERING THAN THE FOLLIES OF THE PITIFUL
AND FROM THIS THOU DIDST GO ON TO ADD AS BY THE WAY THE PROOF THAT NO ONE WOULD BE HAPPY UNLESS HE WERE LIKEWISE GOD AGAIN THOU DIDST SAY THAT THE VERY FORM OF GOOD WAS THE ESSENCE BOTH OF GOD
THEN SAID I WITH ALL MY HEART I AGREE WITH PLATO INDEED THIS IS NOW THE SECOND TIME THAT THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO MY MIND FIRST I LOST THEM THROUGH THE CLOGGING CONTACT OF THE BODY
THE MUTUAL NEED OF WARMTH IS ONLY VERY MODERATELY SATISFIED BUT THEN PEOPLE DO NOT GET PRICKED
BUT MOST OF ALL AT THESE VERY WORDS WHICH THOU USEST I AM NOW AT LAST ASHAMED OF THE FOLLY THAT SO SORELY VEXED ME THOU HAST HEARD THE STORY OF THE GIANTS ASSAILING HEAVEN
THERE ARE SOME REALLY BEAUTIFULLY LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD BUT THE HUMAN FIGURES IN THEM ARE POOR AND YOU HAD NOT BETTER LOOK AT THEM
AS IT HAPPENETH WITH ME SO IS IT WITH ALL FRUITS THAT TURN RIPE IT IS THE HONEY IN MY VEINS THAT MAKETH MY BLOOD THICKER AND ALSO MY SOUL STILLER
FOR SUCH IS THE FORM OF THE DIVINE ESSENCE THAT NEITHER CAN IT PASS INTO THINGS EXTERNAL NOR TAKE UP ANYTHING EXTERNAL INTO ITSELF BUT AS PARMENIDES SAYS OF IT
BUT IN TWO ENTIRELY OPPOSITE WAYS ACCORDING AS IT IS HIS PHYSICAL OR HIS MENTAL STATURE THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE ONE WILL SEEM SMALLER THE FARTHER OFF YOU MOVE THE OTHER
AS THE ECHOES WAKEN ALL TAENARUS IS SHAKEN WHILST HE TO RUTH PERSUADES
DAY'S THRESHOLD ALL BUT WON LOOKED LOST AND WAS UNDONE YE WHO THE LIGHT PURSUE THIS STORY IS FOR YOU WHO SEEK TO FIND A WAY
A USEFUL FOLLY HERE ALOFT CAN I NOW SPEAK FREER THAN IN FRONT OF MOUNTAIN CAVES AND ANCHORITES DOMESTIC ANIMALS WHAT TO SACRIFICE I SQUANDER WHAT IS GIVEN ME
BY HIS OWN POWER ALONE HE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IT CANNOT BE DENIED NOW GOD WAS PROVED TO BE ABSOLUTE GOOD
WERE THERE NOT ONE WHO KEEPS TOGETHER WHAT HE HAS JOINED NOR WOULD THE ORDER OF NATURE PROCEED SO REGULARLY NOR COULD ITS COURSE EXHIBIT MOTIONS SO FIXED IN RESPECT OF POSITION TIME RANGE EFFICACY
YE WAGS ANSWERED ZARATHUSTRA AND SMILED HOW WELL DID YE CHOOSE THE SIMILE BUT YE KNOW ALSO THAT MY HAPPINESS IS HEAVY
NO PATIENT ONE RATHER ONE WHO HATH EVEN UNLEARNT PATIENCE BECAUSE HE NO LONGER SUFFERETH FOR MY FATE GIVETH ME TIME IT HATH FORGOTTEN ME PERHAPS
AND GENERALLY TO AFFORD HELP TO THOSE INTELLECTUAL EFFORTS WHICH ENNOBLE THE RACE WHEREVER THESE INSTITUTIONS MAY BE
A POSTURING WRATH SNORTER WITH WAITING A HOLY HOWL STORM FROM THE MOUNTAINS AN IMPATIENT ONE THAT SHOUTETH DOWN INTO THE VALLEYS HEARKEN ELSE I WILL SCOURGE YOU WITH THE SCOURGE OF GOD
SINCE GOD IS RIGHTLY BELIEVED TO GOVERN ALL THINGS WITH THE RUDDER OF GOODNESS AND SINCE ALL THINGS DO LIKEWISE AS I HAVE TAUGHT HASTE TOWARDS GOOD BY THE VERY AIM OF NATURE CAN IT BE DOUBTED THAT HIS GOVERNANCE IS WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
UNTO THE CLEARER DAY IF ON THE DARKNESS PAST ONE BACKWARD LOOK YE CAST YOUR WEAK AND WANDERING EYES
AND THAT GIOVANNI POSSESSED SEVERAL QUALITIES FAR SURPASSING THOSE OF SALVESTRO THE ASSOCIATES OF NICCOLO WERE UNINFLUENCED BY HIS REMARKS FOR THEY WERE JEALOUS OF HIS REPUTATION AND DESIRED TO EXALT SOME PERSON
SHE LIKED TO RETURN AT NIGHT TO HER OWN LITTLE HOME SOLITARY AND SIMPLE AS IT WAS AND FELT A GREAT REPUGNANCE TO ACCEPT ANY PLACE WHERE SHE WOULD BE MIXED UP WITH FAMILY AFFAIRS AGAIN
REDUCED IT ALMOST TO NOTHING THE FIRST FAMILIES THAT SUFFERED IN THIS WAY WERE THE ALBERTI THE
FROM THE POWERFUL ENEMIES WHICH EACH CONDITION CREATES ITSELF THEY NEITHER HAVE NOR CAN POSSESS ANY STABILITY FOR TYRANNY CANNOT PLEASE THE GOOD AND LICENSE IS OFFENSIVE TO THE WISE
UPON CONDITION THAT IF HE WISHED TO ALIENATE THEM THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE GENOESE IT
BUT REMEMBER I DIDN'T ASK IT FIRST SAID RACHEL HALF DROPPING THE HAND SHE HAD HELD IN BOTH HER OWN YOU PROUD CREATURE I'LL REMEMBER
WHO WAS IN FEAR OF ANTONIO BENTIVOGLI AN EMIGRANT OF BOLOGNA AT CASTEL BOLOGNESE SENT FORCES TO THAT CITY WHICH BEING CLOSE UPON THE FLORENTINE TERRITORY FILLED THE CITIZENS WITH APPREHENSION
AND THE EYES WERE OLD WITH THAT INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION WHICH COMES TO THOSE WHO COUNT THEIR LIVES BY EMOTIONS NOT BY YEARS STRANGELY HAUNTING EYES TO CHRISTIE FOR THEY SEEMED TO APPEAL TO HER
THESE OFT REPEATED ACTS OF OPPRESSION HUMILIATED THE FACTION AND ALMOST ANNIHILATED IT
AND AMONG THE REST GIOVANNI DE MEDICI WHO PUBLICLY ENDEAVORED TO SHOW
TO SEND GUIDO TORELLO AS HIS AGENT WITH FORCES TO SEIZE THE GOVERNMENT OF FURLI AND THUS THE TERRITORY FELL INTO THE DUKE'S HANDS WHEN THIS WAS KNOWN AT FLORENCE
BY MEANS OF WHOM HE MIGHT BE HUMBLED THIS WAS THE STATE OF FLORENCE IN WHICH OPPOSING FEELINGS BEGAN TO BE OBSERVABLE WHEN FILIPPO VISCONTI
THE GOOD SOUL HAD VENTURED SOUTH AND TRIED TO BUY HER MOTHER BUT OLE MISSIS WOULD NOT LET HER GO AT ANY PRICE AND THE FAITHFUL CHATTEL WOULD NOT RUN AWAY
WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN MERELY THE LEADERS OF THE RABBLE HAVING REPEATEDLY DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO MEET AGAIN AT AN APPOINTED HOUR
BUT RACHEL ONLY COLORED KEPT HER EYES FIXED ON HER WORK AND WAS MORE RESERVED THAN EVER THIS INTERESTED CHRISTIE
EXPLAINING TO THEM HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS TO AGGRANDIZE ONE WHO POSSESSED SO MUCH INFLUENCE THAT IT WAS EASY TO REMEDY AN EVIL AT ITS COMMENCEMENT
SHOWING THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT TO JUDGE OF ACTIONS MERELY BY THEIR EFFECTS FOR IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT WHAT HAS BEEN VERY MATURELY CONSIDERED IS ATTENDED WITH UNFAVORABLE RESULTS
AND ADVISED THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF RELIEF BUT THEIR ADVICE WAS REJECTED IN THE COUNCILS THEREFORE TO RENDER THE LAW AS OFFENSIVE AS POSSIBLE
MAY BE CONSTANTLY APPREHENDED HE SAID IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT THEIR RESOLUTION WOULD HAVE TWO EXCEEDINGLY PERNICIOUS EFFECTS THE ONE CONFERRING HONORS ON THOSE WHO HAVING NEVER POSSESSED THEM
AND WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING A SORT OF SEWING MACHINE WHEN LIFE WAS BRIGHTENED FOR HER BY THE FINDING OF A FRIEND AMONG THE GIRLS WAS ONE QUIET SKILFUL CREATURE
WHILE THE FORMER BRINGS ALIKE GRATIFICATION AND PROFIT THEN DIRECTING HIS DISCOURSE MORE PARTICULARLY TO RINALDO HE SAID
HE THEN MODESTLY REMINDED THEM OF WHAT HE HAD SAID UPON A FORMER OCCASION AND OF THEIR RELUCTANCE TO REMEDY THE EVIL WHEN IT MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN DONE
AMONG HER COMPANIONS WAS ONE AND ONE ONLY WHO ATTRACTED HER THE OTHERS WERE WELL MEANING GIRLS BUT
HE REMINDED THEM OF THE INIQUITY OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS IN POWER FROM THIRTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
MEASURES FOR THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR ATTEMPT OF THE HIGHER CLASSES TO DEPRIVE THE PLEBEIANS OF THEIR SHARE IN THE GOVERNMENT
THE FLORENTINES FINDING IMOLA IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY AND THE WAR PUBLICLY KNOWN SENT THEIR FORCES TO FURLI AND BESIEGED IT ON ALL SIDES THAT THE DUKE'S PEOPLE MIGHT NOT RELIEVE IT
AND WHEN WE QUARREL I'LL TAKE ALL THE BLAME UPON MYSELF THEN CHRISTIE KISSED HER WARMLY WHISKED AWAY THE TEAR
IT BEGAN TO BE THE IMPRESSION OF ALL THAT ARMS WOULD BE RESORTED TO AND ALL PRUDENT PERSONS APPREHENDED SOME APPROACHING EVIL
TO WHICH A CITY IS ACCUSTOMED THERE BEING NOTHING SO INJURIOUS TO THE PEOPLE AS SUCH A CHANGE FOR MANY ARE NECESSARILY OFFENDED AND WHERE THERE ARE SEVERAL DISCONTENTED
BOB O' LINKS MAKING RAPTUROUS MUSIC BY THE RIVER AND THE SMELL OF NEW MOWN HAY
SO DAY AFTER DAY SHE WENT TO HER SEAT IN THE WORKROOM WHERE A DOZEN OTHER YOUNG WOMEN SAT SEWING BUSILY ON GAY GARMENTS WITH AS MUCH LIVELY GOSSIP TO BEGUILE THE TIME AS MISS COTTON THE FOREWOMAN WOULD ALLOW
WHO AT FIRST IN ORDER TO CONCILIATE DID NOT COMPLAIN OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR HARDSHIPS
AND AN INTENSE FROST HAVING RENDERED THE DITCHES OF THE CITY PASSABLE HE CROSSED THEM DURING THE NIGHT CAPTURED THE PLACE AND SENT LODOVICO A PRISONER TO MILAN
WITH COMPLAINTS AND ALL CONDEMNED
THEIR LOSS WOULD BE STILL GREATER IF THEY ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE DEJECTED BUT IF THEY SET A BOLD FRONT AGAINST ADVERSITY AND MADE GOOD USE OF THE MEANS WITHIN THEIR POWER
FINDING THE STRONG POSITION WHICH THE FLORENTINES HAD TAKEN PREVENTED HIM FROM RELIEVING FURLI DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT THE CAPTURE OF ZAGONARA THINKING THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT PLACE TO BE LOST
IT WOULD THUS BE EVIDENT THAT THE INJURY DONE TO ONE PARTY
ENABLE THEM TO COMPLETE THE RUIN BOTH OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CITY TO THIS GIOVANNI REPLIED THAT HE CONSIDERED IT THE DUTY OF A GOOD AND WISE CITIZEN TO AVOID ALTERING THE INSTITUTIONS
WHO MAY BE REMOVED BY DEATH OR BECOME UNSERVICEABLE BY MISFORTUNE HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WHICH COMMENCED IN FLORENCE AT THE DEATH OF GIORGIO SCALI IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
THAT NOW THE SAME REMEDY COULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED WITHOUT INCURRING THE DANGER OF GREATER EVILS AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR THEM TO DO
AND OVERTURN THE GOVERNMENT WHICH FOR FORTY TWO YEARS HAD RULED THE CITY WITH SO MUCH GLORY THE CITIZENS WOULD THEN BE SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF THE MULTITUDE AND LIVE DISORDERLY AND DANGEROUS
AND HIS ADVICE WAS APPROVED OF BY THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY
WHICH ENJOYED FREEDOM UNDER THE DOGIATE OF TOMMASO DA CAMPO FREGOSO HE DID NOT THINK IT ADVISABLE TO ATTEMPT THIS
WITH THE PERMISSION OF LORENZO RIDOLFI AND FRANCESCO GIANFIGLIAZZI
MANY OTHERS WHETHER ENVIOUS OF THOSE IN POWER OR FEARING A RUPTURE WITH THE DUKE CONSIDERED IT UNADVISABLE SO LIGHTLY TO ENTERTAIN SUSPICIONS OF AN ALLY
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE GAVE SO MUCH GRATIFICATION TO THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE THE MULTITUDE THINKING THEY HAD NOW FOUND A DEFENDER THAT NOT WITHOUT OCCASION THE JUDICIOUS OF THE PARTY OBSERVED IT WITH JEALOUSY
TO WHOM WILL THEY FLEE FOR ASSISTANCE NOW TO POPE MARTIN WHOM THEY RIDICULED BEFORE THE FACE OF BRACCIO OR TO QUEEN GIOVANNA WHOM THEY ABANDONED
ESTEEMED THEM THE LESS AND THEREFORE HAD THE LESS OCCASION TO GRIEVE FOR THEIR ABSENCE THE OTHER TAKING THEM FROM THOSE WHO BEING ACCUSTOMED TO THEIR POSSESSION
AND MORE SOLITARY THAN HERSELF
BUT NONE FELT IT SO SEVERELY AS THE NOBILITY WHO HAD BEEN IN FAVOR OF THE WAR FOR THEY PERCEIVED THEIR ENEMIES TO BE INSPIRITED AND THEMSELVES DISARMED WITHOUT FRIENDS AND OPPOSED BY THE PEOPLE
FOR SOME WEEKS CHRISTIE RESTED AND REFRESHED HERSELF BY MAKING HER ROOM GAY
PREVAILED THE COUNCIL OF TEN WERE APPOINTED FORCES WERE HIRED AND NEW TAXES LEVIED WHICH AS THEY WERE MORE BURDENSOME UPON THE LOWER THAN THE UPPER RANKS FILLED THE CITY
THE FIRST TO DO SO WAS GIOVANNI DI BICCI DE MEDICI WHO HAVING BECOME ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN AND BEING OF A HUMANE AND BENEVOLENT DISPOSITION
FOR I CAN HELP IN NO OTHER WAY AND IF I NEED MONEY I CAN ALWAYS EARN IT THANK GOD SAID CHRISTIE AS HEPSEY HESITATED TO TAKE SO MUCH FROM A FELLOW WORKER
HER EVENINGS AT HOME WERE DEVOTED TO BOOKS FOR SHE HAD THE TRUE NEW ENGLAND WOMAN'S DESIRE FOR EDUCATION AND READ OR STUDIED FOR THE LOVE OF IT THUS SHE HAD MUCH TO THINK OF AS HER NEEDLE FLEW
AND THEIR DULL LIFE FOSTERED
BUT THESE ADVANTAGES ARE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN DENIED TO THOSE WHICH FREQUENTLY CHANGE FROM TYRANNY TO LICENSE OR THE REVERSE BECAUSE
WITH A MUTE ELOQUENCE SHE COULD NOT RESIST IN VAIN DID RACHEL ANSWER HER WITH QUIET COLDNESS NOD SILENTLY WHEN SHE WISHED HER A CHEERY GOOD MORNING AND KEEP RESOLUTELY IN HER OWN SOMEWHAT ISOLATED CORNER
OR BE UNDER THE COMMAND OF SOME INDIVIDUAL WHO MIGHT MAKE HIMSELF PRINCE FOR THESE REASONS HE WAS OF OPINION THAT WHOEVER LOVED HIS COUNTRY AND HIS HONOR MUST AROUSE HIMSELF AND CALL TO MIND
SINCE SHARES IN THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD PAY SPLENDID DIVIDENDS THAT NEVER FAIL ANOTHER PORTION OF HER FORTUNE AS SHE CALLED HARRY'S GIFT WAS BESTOWED IN WEDDING PRESENTS UPON LUCY WHO AT LENGTH
THE ELDEST SON OF MASO WHO BY HIS OWN TALENTS AND THE RESPECT HE DERIVED FROM THE MEMORY OF HIS FATHER ASPIRED TO THE FIRST OFFICES IN THE GOVERNMENT
HAVING BY THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER BECOME MASTER OF ALL LOMBARDY AND THINKING HE MIGHT UNDERTAKE ALMOST ANYTHING
THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF WAR WERE GREATLY STRENGTHENED BUT
BUT EVERYTHING TENDED TO EXCITE SUSPICION
THUS ENCOURAGED THE CITIZENS ENGAGED COUNT ODDO THE SON OF BRACCIO AND UNITED WITH HIM FOR DIRECTING THE OPERATIONS OF THE WAR
BUT WHAT GAVE EVERY ONE GREATER ALARM AND OFFERED SUFFICIENT OCCASION FOR THE DECLARATION OF WAR WAS THE EXPEDITION MADE BY THE DUKE AGAINST FURLI
WHICH IT HAD LACKED BEFORE NOW SOME ONE CARED FOR HER AND BETTER STILL SHE COULD MAKE SOME ONE HAPPY AND IN THE ACT OF LAVISHING THE AFFECTION OF HER GENEROUS NATURE ON A CREATURE SADDER
FILIPPO VISCONTI DUKE OF MILAN
AND A SMILE THAT SHOWED HOW WINSOME HER FACE HAD BEEN BEFORE MANY TEARS WASHED ITS BLOOM AWAY
ITS INSTITUTIONS FIRM AND SECURE FOR HAVING GOOD LAWS FOR ITS BASIS AND GOOD REGULATIONS FOR CARRYING THEM INTO EFFECT IT NEEDS NOT LIKE OTHERS
FOR A WHILE IT DIVERTED CHRISTIE AS SHE HAD A FEMININE LOVE FOR PRETTY THINGS AND ENJOYED SEEING DELICATE SILKS COSTLY LACE AND ALL THE INDESCRIBABLE FANTASIES OF FASHION
ALL THAT RINALDO HAD ADVANCED WAS CORRECT AND THE REMEDIES HE PROPOSED GOOD AND CERTAIN IF THEY COULD BE ADOPTED WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTE DIVISION OF THE CITY AND THIS HE HAD NO DOUBT
SENT AMBASSADORS TO THE CITY TO INTIMATE THAT HE WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT THE SUSPICIONS THEY ENTERTAINED AND OFFERED TO REVOKE WHATEVER HE HAD DONE
SHE TOOK INFINITE SATISFACTION IN SENDING ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO UNCLE ENOS
CHRISTIE KEPT HER WORD ASKED NO QUESTIONS VOLUNTEERED NO CONFIDENCES BUT HEARTILY ENJOYED THE NEW FRIENDSHIP
BUT TO AGGRANDIZE THEIR OWN POWER WHICH GOD HAS VERY JUSTLY ABATED THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ENTERPRISE BY MANY A ONE WITH WHICH THEY HAVE OPPRESSED THE CITY
BUT IF THEY WERE TO STRIKE THE FIRST BLOW AT THE DUKE PUBLIC OPINION WOULD BE AS FAVORABLE TO HIM AS TO THEMSELVES AND BESIDES THEY COULD NOT SO CONFIDENTLY DEMAND ASSISTANCE AS ASSAILANTS
HE ADVISED THEM TO IMITATE THE CONDUCT OF THEIR FOREFATHERS WHO BY COURAGEOUS CONDUCT IN ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES HAD DEFENDED THEMSELVES AGAINST ALL THEIR ENEMIES
TO MAKE WAR AT ANOTHER'S DOOR THAN AT OUR OWN THESE VIEWS PREVAILED AND IT WAS RESOLVED THAT THE TEN SHOULD PROVIDE ALL THE MEANS IN THEIR POWER FOR RESCUING FURLI FROM THE HANDS OF THE DUKE
AND TRY IF HE COULD INDUCE HIM TO JOIN THEM HE UNDERTOOK THIS COMMISSION AND IN THE MOST PREVAILING WORDS HE COULD MAKE USE OF
TO THESE REPROACHES WAS ADDED ALL THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM AN ENRAGED MULTITUDE SEEING THE DISCONTENT SO PREVALENT
WHICH HE OBTAINED ON CONDITION OF GIVING UP ZAGONARA IF THE FLORENTINES DID NOT RELIEVE HIM WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS THIS MISFORTUNE BEING KNOWN IN THE FLORENTINE CAMP AND IN THE CITY
POSTPONED ALL PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND SENT AGNOLO DELLA PERGOLA WITH A STRONG FORCE AGAINST IMOLA
AND THOUGHT HIS PROCEEDINGS NEED NOT HAVE EXCITED SO MUCH DISTRUST THAT APPOINTING THE TEN AND HIRING FORCES WAS IN ITSELF A MANIFEST DECLARATION OF WAR WHICH IF UNDERTAKEN AGAINST SO GREAT A PRINCE
AND BY SHARING WITH OTHERS THE MONEY WHICH HARRY HAD SMUGGLED INTO HER POSSESSION AFTER SHE HAD STEADILY REFUSED TO TAKE ONE PENNY MORE THAN THE SUM AGREED UPON WHEN SHE FIRST WENT TO THEM
AND SET HER HEART ON REPAYING EVERY FRACTION OF IT ANOTHER HUNDRED SHE GAVE TO HEPSEY WHO FOUND HER OUT AND CAME TO REPORT HER TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS
THERE WAS NOTHING IN HER POSSESSION THAT SHE DID NOT OFFER RACHEL
YOU MUST TAKE IT HEPSEY FOR I COULD NOT REST HAPPY IF I PUT IT AWAY TO LIE IDLE WHILE YOU CAN SAVE MEN AND WOMEN FROM TORMENT WITH IT I'D GIVE IT IF IT WAS MY LAST PENNY
AND WOULD SOON IF NOT RESTRAINED BY GREATER FORCE OR BETTER REGULATIONS APPOINT THE MAGISTRATES WHO
AS PATIENTLY AND AS GENTLY AS A LOVER MIGHT DETERMINED TO WIN HER CONFIDENCE BECAUSE ALL THE OTHERS HAD FAILED TO DO IT SOMETIMES SHE LEFT A FLOWER IN RACHEL'S BASKET ALWAYS SMILED AND NODDED AS SHE ENTERED
AND PLACE HIM IN THE HANDS OF THE DUKE UPON THIS FILIPPO
AND THE VICINITY OF THE CHURCH OUGHT TO PREVENT ANY ATTEMPT AGAINST ROMAGNA ITSELF HOWEVER
NOT BY THE INFLUENCE OF LIBERTY OR SUBJECTION AS MANY SUPPOSE BUT BY THAT OF SLAVERY AND LICENSE FOR WITH THE NOBILITY OR THE PEOPLE THE MINISTERS RESPECTIVELY OF SLAVERY OR LICENTIOUSNESS
BOTH BY THE REDUCTION IN THEIR NUMBER AND BY INCREASING THE AUTHORITY OF THE GREAT WHO ON ACCOUNT OF FORMER ENMITIES WOULD BE DISINCLINED TO FAVOR THEM HE ADDED THAT IT IS A GOOD THING
THESE THINGS DISTURBED THE MINDS OF THE CITIZENS AND MADE THEM APPREHENSIVE OF NEW TROUBLES CONSIDER THE MEANS TO BE ADOPTED FOR THEIR DEFENSE
AND HE HAD BESIDES ENTERED INTO ANOTHER TREATY WITH THE LEGATE OF BOLOGNA
THE THOUGHT OF THAT INVESTMENT LAY WARM AT CHRISTIE'S HEART AND NEVER WOKE A REGRET FOR WELL SHE KNEW THAT EVERY DOLLAR OF IT WOULD BE BLESSED
DECLARING THAT TO GRATIFY THEMSELVES AND OPPRESS THE PEOPLE THEY WOULD GO TO WAR WITHOUT ANY JUSTIFIABLE MOTIVE THEY HAD NOT YET COME TO AN OPEN RUPTURE WITH THE DUKE
AND OFTEN STOPPED TO ADMIRE THE WORK OF HER TASTEFUL FINGERS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST SUCH FRIENDLY OVERTURES
ON ENCOUNTERING THE ENEMY THEY WERE SOON ROUTED NOT SO MUCH BY THE BRAVERY OF THEIR ADVERSARIES AS BY THE SEVERITY OF THE SEASON FOR HAVING MARCHED MANY HOURS THROUGH DEEP MUD AND HEAVY RAIN
AS THEY MIGHT DO IF ASSAILED AND THAT MEN ALWAYS DEFEND THEMSELVES MORE VIGOROUSLY WHEN THEY ATTACK OTHERS THE ADVOCATES OF WAR CONSIDERED IT IMPROPER TO AWAIT THE ENEMY IN THEIR HOUSES
OR OTHERWISE FOR SOME OF THEM BELONGING TO THE COUNCIL OF TEN FORCES MIGHT BE LED INTO THE CITY WITHOUT EXCITING OBSERVATION RINALDO WAS MUCH APPLAUDED
AND LAPO NICCOLINI THE FACTIONS THAT AROSE FROM THE QUARRELS OF THE ALBIZZI AND THE RICCI AND WHICH WERE AFTERWARD SO UNHAPPILY REVIVED BY SALVESTRO DE MEDICI
THEIR JEALOUSY OF HIM
AND IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE WAS PUT DOWN STILL AS IT COMPREHENDED THE GREATEST NUMERICAL PROPORTION IT WAS NEVER ENTIRELY EXTINCT THOUGH THE FREQUENT BALIAS AND PERSECUTIONS OF ITS LEADERS FROM THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
THAT SOME ATTEMPT SHOULD BE MADE TO RECOVER THE GOVERNMENT SINCE THEIR WANT OF VIGILANCE HAD ENCOURAGED MEN TO CENSURE PUBLIC ACTIONS AND ALLOWED THOSE TO INTERFERE IN AFFAIRS
AND MADE HIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING WITH THEM KNOWN BUT WITH THE AID OF THEIR REPUTATION HE TRUSTED HE SHOULD ATTAIN HIS WISHES HE THEREFORE SENT AMBASSADORS TO FLORENCE TO SIGNIFY HIS DESIRES
THEY WOULD NOT BE SENSIBLE OF THEIR LOSS OR THE DUKE OF HIS VICTORY HE ASSURED THEM THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE ALARMED BY IMPENDING EXPENSES AND CONSEQUENT TAXATION BECAUSE THE LATTER MIGHT BE REDUCED
SOME A FATHER OTHERS A GRANDFATHER PUT TO DEATH BY ITS TYRANNY HE ASSURED THEM THEY WERE NOW IN THE SAME DANGER AND THAT THE CITY WAS SINKING UNDER THE SAME DISORDERS
AND DISTRACTING LEGS AND HAVING GAINED HER POINT MARRIED HIM WITH DRAMATIC CELERITY AND WENT WEST TO FOLLOW THE FORTUNES OF HER LORD THE OLD THEATRE WAS TO BE DEMOLISHED AND THE COMPANY SCATTERED
DESCRIBING THE CONDITION OF THE CITY AND SHOWING HOW BY THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE IT HAD AGAIN FALLEN UNDER THE POWER OF THE PLEBEIANS FROM WHOM IT HAD BEEN WRESTED BY THEIR FATHERS IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
THE FLORENTINES MURMUR AGAINST THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ADVOCATES OF THE WAR
IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD BE WRONG TO BLAME A WISE RESOLUTION
AND THE FUTURE EXPENSE WOULD NOT BE SO GREAT AS THE FORMER HAD BEEN FOR LESS PREPARATION IS NECESSARY FOR THOSE ENGAGED IN SELF DEFENSE THAN FOR THOSE WHO DESIGN TO ATTACK OTHERS
GIOVANNI DE MEDICI WAS NOT AMONG THEM EITHER BECAUSE BEING UNDER SUSPICION HE WAS NOT INVITED OR THAT ENTERTAINING DIFFERENT VIEWS HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERFERE
WHO BY THE RUIN OF THE ALBERTI RESCUED THE CITY FROM THE DANGERS THEN IMPENDING AND THAT THE CAUSE OF THE AUDACITY NOW ASSUMED BY THE MULTITUDE WAS THE EXTENSIVE SQUITTINI OR POLLINGS WHICH BY THEIR NEGLIGENCE
THAT NOW THE GREAT HAVING BEEN HUMBLED AND THE PLEBEIANS BECOME INSOLENT IT WAS WELL TO RESTRAIN THE INSOLENCE OF THE LATTER BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THE FORMER TO EFFECT THIS THEY MIGHT PROCEED EITHER OPENLY
WHO AT THE CORNERS OF STREETS INSULTED THEM WITH SARCASTIC EXPRESSIONS COMPLAINING OF THE HEAVY TAXES AND THE UNNECESSARY WAR AND SAYING OH THEY APPOINTED THE TEN TO FRIGHTEN THE ENEMY HAVE THEY RELIEVED FURLI
AND AS IN THE TREATY WHICH FILIPPO MADE WITH THE DOGE OF GENOA
HE WOULD GAIN FEW FRIENDS AND MAKE MANY ENEMIES
WERE ALLOWED TO BE MADE FOR THUS THE PALACE HAD BECOME FILLED WITH LOW MEN HE THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY MEANS OF REMEDYING THE EVIL WAS TO RESTORE THE GOVERNMENT TO THE NOBILITY
AND ALL BEING ANXIOUS THAT THE ENEMY SHOULD NOT OBTAIN THE EXPECTED ADVANTAGE THEY ENABLED HIM TO SECURE A GREATER FOR HAVING ABANDONED THE SIEGE OF FURLI TO GO TO THE RELIEF OF ZAGONARA
FOR THERE WERE LINES ON THE FOREHEAD THAT CONTRASTED STRONGLY WITH THE BRIGHT ABUNDANT HAIR ABOVE
WHOSE BLACK DRESS PECULIAR FACE AND SILENT WAYS ATTRACTED CHRISTIE HER EVIDENT DESIRE TO BE LET ALONE AMUSED THE NEW COMER AT FIRST AND SHE MADE NO EFFORT TO KNOW HER BUT PRESENTLY SHE BECAME AWARE
SO A FAREWELL FESTIVAL WAS HELD AND CHRISTIE WENT TO IT FEELING MORE SOLITARY THAN EVER AS SHE BADE HER OLD FRIENDS A LONG GOOD BYE THE REST OF THE MONEY BURNED IN HER POCKET
GIORGIO ORDELAFFI WAS LORD OF FURLI
OR KNOW WHAT A BLESSED THING IT IS TO FIND SUCH AN ONE AS YOU ARE THEN I MAY LOVE YOU AND NOT BE AFRAID OF OFFENDING CRIED CHRISTIE MUCH TOUCHED YES
BUT THAT IF HE DID NOT CONCUR WITH THEM THEY COULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT ARMS AND THAT WITH THEM THEY WOULD INCUR THE RISK OF BEING VANQUISHED OR OF NOT BEING ABLE TO REAP THE FRUIT OF VICTORY
IN THE FORMER THE INSOLENT HAVE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY AND IN THE LATTER THE FOOLISH
BY REDUCING THE COMPANIES FROM FOURTEEN TO SEVEN
HENCE FOLLOWED MANY LAMENTABLE COLLISIONS
AND TO MAKE ALL SENSIBLE OF ITS INJUSTICE THEY CONTRIVED THAT THE TAXES SHOULD BE LEVIED WITH THE UTMOST RIGOR AND MADE IT LAWFUL TO KILL ANY THAT MIGHT RESIST THE OFFICERS EMPLOYED TO COLLECT THEM
FOR SHE WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS THOUGH EVIDENTLY YOUNGER THAN SHE LOOKED RACHEL'S FACE WAS THAT OF ONE WHO HAD KNOWN SOME GREAT SORROW SOME DEEP EXPERIENCE
THE DUKE TOOK POSSESSION OF BRESCIA AND SHORTLY AFTERWARD OF GENOA CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATION OF THOSE WHO HAD ADVOCATED PEACE FOR THEY THOUGHT BRESCIA WOULD BE DEFENDED BY THE VENETIANS AND GENOA
IT IS WELL I SAID EXTENDING MY HAND FOR ANOTHER LICKING KISS I BEGAN TO REALISE WHAT ITS PRESENCE MEANT AND THE TIDE OF MY COURAGE FLOWED WHERE ARE THE OTHERS I ASKED THEY ARE MAD THEY ARE FOOLS SAID THE DOG MAN
AND THE DWINDLING SHREDS OF THE HUMANITY STILL STARTLED ME EVERY NOW AND THEN A MOMENTARY RECRUDESCENCE OF SPEECH PERHAPS AN UNEXPECTED DEXTERITY OF THE FORE FEET A PITIFUL ATTEMPT TO WALK ERECT I TOO MUST HAVE UNDERGONE STRANGE CHANGES
AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HOUSE OF PAIN HAD AFFECTED THEM I KNOW NOW THE FOLLY OF MY COWARDICE
ASK ME TO SAY IT AGAIN LEARN IT BY HEART AND GO OFF REPEATING IT WITH A WORD WRONG HERE OR THERE TO ALL THE MILDER OF THE BEAST PEOPLE HE THOUGHT NOTHING OF WHAT WAS PLAIN AND COMPREHENSIBLE I INVENTED SOME VERY CURIOUS BIG THINKS FOR HIS ESPECIAL USE
HE HAD LONG SINCE LOST SPEECH AND ACTIVE MOVEMENT AND THE LANK HAIR OF THE LITTLE BRUTE GREW THICKER EVERY DAY AND HIS STUMPY CLAWS MORE ASKEW
AS I APPROACHED THE MONSTER LIFTED ITS GLARING EYES TO MINE ITS LIPS WENT TREMBLING BACK FROM ITS RED STAINED TEETH AND IT GROWLED MENACINGLY IT WAS NOT AFRAID AND NOT ASHAMED THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE HUMAN TAINT HAD VANISHED
BUT WITH A CERTAIN LACK OF PRACTICAL SENSE WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY BANE I HAD MADE IT A MILE OR MORE FROM THE SEA AND BEFORE I HAD DRAGGED IT DOWN TO THE BEACH THE THING HAD FALLEN TO PIECES PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL THAT I WAS SAVED FROM LAUNCHING IT
THE GREY THING LEAPT ASIDE M'LING WITH A SNARL FLEW AT IT AND WAS STRUCK ASIDE MONTGOMERY FIRED
A DREADFUL THING THAT I WAS ONLY BEGINNING TO REALISE WAS THAT OVER ALL THIS ISLAND THERE WAS NOW NO SAFE PLACE WHERE I COULD BE ALONE AND SECURE TO REST OR SLEEP I HAD RECOVERED STRENGTH AMAZINGLY SINCE MY LANDING BUT I WAS STILL INCLINED TO BE NERVOUS AND TO BREAK DOWN UNDER ANY GREAT STRESS
M'LING WENT FIRST HIS SHOULDER HUNCHED HIS STRANGE BLACK HEAD MOVING WITH QUICK STARTS AS HE PEERED FIRST ON THIS SIDE OF THE WAY AND THEN ON THAT HE WAS UNARMED HIS AXE HE HAD DROPPED WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED THE SWINE MAN TEETH WERE HIS WEAPONS WHEN IT CAME TO FIGHTING
IT WAS ABOUT MAY WHEN I FIRST DISTINCTLY PERCEIVED A GROWING DIFFERENCE IN THEIR SPEECH AND CARRIAGE A GROWING COARSENESS OF ARTICULATION A GROWING DISINCLINATION TO TALK
HE HAS CHANGED HIS SHAPE HE HAS CHANGED HIS BODY I WENT ON FOR A TIME YOU WILL NOT SEE HIM HE IS THERE I POINTED UPWARD WHERE HE CAN WATCH YOU YOU CANNOT SEE HIM BUT HE CAN SEE YOU FEAR THE LAW
WE HAD SOME FOOD AND THEN ALL THREE OF US STARTED IT IS POSSIBLY DUE TO THE TENSION OF MY MIND AT THE TIME BUT EVEN NOW THAT START INTO THE HOT STILLNESS OF THE TROPICAL AFTERNOON IS A SINGULARLY VIVID IMPRESSION
BORE ME A GRUDGE BUT IT VENTED ITSELF CHIEFLY BEHIND MY BACK AND AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM MY MISSILES IN GRIMACES THE HYENA SWINE AVOIDED ME AND I WAS ALWAYS ON THE ALERT FOR HIM MY INSEPARABLE DOG MAN HATED AND DREADED HIM INTENSELY
FOR A MOMENT THE OPENING OF THE HUT WAS BLACKENED BY THE EXIT OF THE DOG MAN THEN I FOLLOWED AND STOOD UP ALMOST IN THE EXACT SPOT WHERE I HAD BEEN WHEN I HAD HEARD MOREAU AND HIS STAGHOUND PURSUING ME
IN THE DAWN THE SAIL WAS NEARER AND I SAW IT WAS THE DIRTY LUG SAIL OF A SMALL BOAT BUT IT SAILED STRANGELY MY EYES WERE WEARY WITH WATCHING AND I PEERED AND COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM TWO MEN WERE IN THE BOAT SITTING LOW DOWN ONE BY THE BOWS THE OTHER AT THE RUDDER
SUDDENLY A GREAT WHITE BIRD FLEW UP OUT OF THE BOAT AND NEITHER OF THE MEN STIRRED NOR NOTICED IT IT CIRCLED ROUND AND THEN CAME SWEEPING OVERHEAD WITH ITS STRONG WINGS OUTSPREAD THEN I STOPPED SHOUTING AND SAT DOWN ON THE HEADLAND AND RESTED MY CHIN ON MY HANDS AND STARED
ONE HAD A SHOCK OF RED HAIR LIKE THE CAPTAIN OF THE IPECACUANHA AND A DIRTY WHITE CAP LAY IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT AS I STOOD BESIDE THE BOAT THREE OF THE BEASTS CAME SLINKING OUT OF THE BUSHES AND SNIFFING TOWARDS ME
HE IS DEAD SAID THIS MONSTER THEY SAW THERE WAS NOTHING THREATENING ABOUT THIS DETACHMENT AT ANY RATE
HE IS NOT DEAD SAID I IN A LOUD VOICE EVEN NOW HE WATCHES US THIS STARTLED THEM TWENTY PAIRS OF EYES REGARDED ME THE HOUSE OF PAIN IS GONE SAID I IT WILL COME AGAIN
NONE OF THE ABUNDANT CREEPERS SEEMED LIMBER OR STRONG ENOUGH AND WITH ALL MY LITTER OF SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION I COULD NOT DEVISE ANY WAY OF MAKING THEM SO
MY THOUGHTS WERE DISTURBED BY A CRYING OF SEA BIRDS HURRYING TOWARDS SOME BLACK OBJECT THAT HAD BEEN STRANDED BY THE WAVES ON THE BEACH NEAR THE ENCLOSURE I KNEW WHAT THAT OBJECT WAS BUT I HAD NOT THE HEART TO GO BACK AND DRIVE THEM OFF
I SAW ITS FEATURES VANISH IN A FLASH ITS FACE WAS DRIVEN IN YET IT PASSED ME GRIPPED MONTGOMERY AND HOLDING HIM FELL HEADLONG BESIDE HIM AND PULLED HIM SPRAWLING UPON ITSELF IN ITS DEATH AGONY I FOUND MYSELF ALONE WITH M'LING THE DEAD BRUTE AND THE PROSTRATE MAN
THEY LOOKED I NOTICED AT THE DEEP CUTS I MADE IN THE TURF THEN THE SATYR RAISED A DOUBT I ANSWERED HIM THEN ONE OF THE DAPPLED THINGS OBJECTED AND AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION SPRANG UP ROUND THE FIRE EVERY MOMENT I BEGAN TO FEEL MORE CONVINCED OF MY PRESENT SECURITY
I KEPT A SHARP EYE FOR MY ENEMY THE HYENA SWINE BUT HE NEVER APPEARED EVERY NOW AND THEN A SUSPICIOUS MOVEMENT WOULD STARTLE ME BUT MY CONFIDENCE GREW RAPIDLY THEN AS THE MOON CREPT DOWN FROM THE ZENITH ONE BY ONE THE LISTENERS BEGAN TO YAWN
I FOUND THEIR SIMPLE SCALE OF HONOUR WAS BASED MAINLY ON THE CAPACITY FOR INFLICTING TRENCHANT WOUNDS INDEED I MAY SAY WITHOUT VANITY I HOPE THAT I HELD SOMETHING LIKE PRE EMINENCE AMONG THEM ONE OR TWO WHOM IN A RARE ACCESS OF HIGH SPIRITS I HAD SCARRED RATHER BADLY
NO GO AWAY I INSISTED AND SNAPPED MY WHIP
FOR THEM AND FOR ME IT CAME WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE SHOCK I STILL WENT AMONG THEM IN SAFETY BECAUSE NO JOLT IN THE DOWNWARD GLIDE HAD RELEASED THE INCREASING CHARGE OF EXPLOSIVE ANIMALISM THAT OUSTED THE HUMAN DAY BY DAY BUT I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SOON NOW THAT SHOCK MUST COME
HE HAD AN IDEA I BELIEVE THAT TO GABBLE ABOUT NAMES THAT MEANT NOTHING WAS THE PROPER USE OF SPEECH HE CALLED IT BIG THINKS TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM LITTLE THINKS THE SANE EVERY DAY INTERESTS OF LIFE IF EVER I MADE A REMARK HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE WOULD PRAISE IT VERY MUCH
I TALKED NOW WITHOUT THE CATCHING IN MY BREATH DUE TO THE INTENSITY OF MY EXCITEMENT THAT HAD TROUBLED ME AT FIRST IN THE COURSE OF ABOUT AN HOUR I HAD REALLY CONVINCED SEVERAL OF THE BEAST FOLK OF THE TRUTH OF MY ASSERTIONS AND TALKED MOST OF THE OTHERS INTO A DUBIOUS STATE
AND THEN CAME A DAY A WONDERFUL DAY WHICH I SPENT IN ECSTASY I SAW A SAIL TO THE SOUTHWEST A SMALL SAIL LIKE THAT OF A LITTLE SCHOONER AND FORTHWITH
PRESENTLY YOU WILL SLAY THEM ALL SAID THE DOG MAN PRESENTLY I ANSWERED I WILL SLAY THEM ALL AFTER CERTAIN DAYS AND CERTAIN THINGS HAVE COME TO PASS EVERY ONE OF THEM SAVE THOSE YOU SPARE EVERY ONE OF THEM SHALL BE SLAIN
AT FIRST I DID NOT UNDERSTAND BUT PRESENTLY IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT HE WISHED ME TO FOLLOW HIM AND THIS I DID AT LAST SLOWLY FOR THE DAY WAS HOT WHEN WE REACHED THE TREES HE CLAMBERED INTO THEM FOR HE COULD TRAVEL BETTER AMONG THEIR SWINGING CREEPERS THAN ON THE GROUND
I SNATCHED MY HAND AWAY A CRY OF ALARM BEGAN AND WAS STIFLED IN MY THROAT
SAID HE WAS DEAD BUT MONTGOMERY WAS STILL SOBER ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND MY MOTIVE IN DENYING MOREAU'S DEATH HE IS NOT DEAD HE SAID SLOWLY NOT DEAD AT ALL NO MORE DEAD THAN I AM SOME
PERHAPS HALF A MILE ALONG THE BEACH I BECAME AWARE OF ONE OF MY THREE BEAST FOLK ADVANCING OUT OF THE LANDWARD BUSHES TOWARDS ME I WAS NOW SO NERVOUS WITH MY OWN IMAGININGS THAT I IMMEDIATELY DREW MY REVOLVER
AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER RETIRED TOWARDS THE DENS IN THE RAVINE AND I DREADING THE SILENCE AND DARKNESS WENT WITH THEM KNOWING I WAS SAFER WITH SEVERAL OF THEM THAN WITH ONE ALONE IN THIS MANNER BEGAN THE LONGER PART OF MY SOJOURN UPON THIS ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU
THE BEAST PEOPLE BY THAT TIME HAD WITH ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS LEFT THE RAVINE AND MADE THEMSELVES LAIRS ACCORDING TO THEIR TASTE AMONG THE THICKETS OF THE ISLAND FEW PROWLED BY DAY MOST OF THEM SLEPT AND THE ISLAND MIGHT HAVE SEEMED DESERTED TO A NEW COMER
I REALISED MORE KEENLY THAN EVER WHAT MOREAU HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE STUBBORN BEAST FLESH THEY WERE REVERTING AND REVERTING VERY RAPIDLY SOME OF THEM THE PIONEERS IN THIS I NOTICED WITH SOME SURPRISE WERE ALL FEMALES
I TURNED MY BACK UPON THEM STRUCK THE LUG AND BEGAN PADDLING OUT TO SEA I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO LOOK BEHIND ME
THERE COULD NOW BE SCARCELY A SCORE LEFT OF THE DANGEROUS CARNIVORES THE BRAVER OF THESE WERE ALREADY DEAD AFTER THE DEATH OF THIS POOR DOG OF MINE MY LAST FRIEND I TOO ADOPTED TO SOME EXTENT THE PRACTICE OF SLUMBERING IN THE DAYTIME IN ORDER TO BE ON MY GUARD AT NIGHT
AT THE FIRST EXCUSE IT MAY SEEM TREACHEROUS BUT SO I WAS RESOLVED I WAS FAR MORE AFRAID OF HIM THAN OF ANY OTHER TWO OF THE BEAST FOLK HIS CONTINUED LIFE WAS I KNEW A THREAT AGAINST MINE
TOWARDS NOON CERTAIN OF THEM CAME AND SQUATTED BASKING IN THE HOT SAND THE IMPERIOUS VOICES OF HUNGER AND THIRST PREVAILED OVER MY DREAD I CAME OUT OF THE BUSHES AND REVOLVER IN HAND WALKED DOWN TOWARDS THESE SEATED FIGURES ONE A WOLF WOMAN TURNED HER HEAD AND STARED AT ME
I ADVANCED A STEP FARTHER STOPPED AND PULLED OUT MY REVOLVER AT LAST I HAD HIM FACE TO FACE THE BRUTE MADE NO SIGN OF RETREAT BUT ITS EARS WENT BACK ITS HAIR BRISTLED AND ITS BODY CROUCHED TOGETHER I AIMED BETWEEN THE EYES AND FIRED
CHILDREN OF THE LAW I SAID HE IS NOT DEAD
IS HE DEAD INDEED IS THERE A LAW REPEATED THE MAN IN WHITE IS THERE A LAW THOU OTHER WITH THE WHIP HE IS DEAD SAID THE HAIRY GREY THING AND THEY ALL STOOD WATCHING US
I TURNED ONCE MORE ALMOST PASSIONATELY NOW TO HAMMERING TOGETHER STAKES AND BRANCHES TO FORM A RAFT FOR MY ESCAPE I FOUND A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES I AM AN EXTREMELY UNHANDY MAN
I SPENT MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT GRUBBING AMONG THE BLACK RUINS OF THE ENCLOSURE AND ON THE BEACH WHERE THE BOATS HAD BEEN BURNT LOOKING FOR NAILS AND OTHER STRAY PIECES OF METAL THAT MIGHT PROVE OF SERVICE
BUT THEY DO NOT HELP THE TELLING OF THE STORY
IS THE LAW NOT ALIVE THIS CAME OF BREAKING THE LAW HE PEERED AT THE BODY HE SENDS THE FIRE THAT KILLS SAID HE IN HIS DEEP VOICE REPEATING PART OF THE RITUAL
BUT STILL MORE AFRAID OF MY CRACKING RED WHIP LASH AND AFTER SOME FUMBLING AND HESITATION SOME WHIP CRACKING AND SHOUTING THEY LIFTED HIM GINGERLY CARRIED HIM DOWN TO THE BEACH AND WENT SPLASHING INTO THE DAZZLING WELTER OF THE SEA ON SAID I
POINTED IS THERE A LAW NOW ASKED THE MONKEY MAN
SO THAT I PREFER TO MAKE NO CHRONICLE FOR THAT GAP OF TIME TO TELL ONLY ONE CARDINAL INCIDENT OF THE TEN MONTHS I SPENT AS AN INTIMATE OF THESE HALF HUMANISED BRUTES THERE IS MUCH THAT STICKS IN MY MEMORY THAT I COULD WRITE THINGS THAT I WOULD CHEERFULLY GIVE MY RIGHT HAND TO FORGET
ONE KNELT THEN THE OTHER TWO I TURNED AND WALKED TOWARDS THE DEAD BODIES KEEPING MY FACE TOWARDS THE THREE KNEELING BEAST MEN VERY MUCH AS AN ACTOR PASSING UP THE STAGE FACES THE AUDIENCE THEY BROKE THE LAW SAID I PUTTING MY FOOT ON THE SAYER OF THE LAW
THERE WAS A SILENCE THEN A CRASHING AMONG THE INTERLACING VEGETATION FIRST HERE THEN THERE AND THEN HALF A DOZEN FACES APPEARED STRANGE FACES LIT BY A STRANGE LIGHT
MOREAU LAY FACE DOWNWARD IN A TRAMPLED SPACE IN A CANEBRAKE ONE HAND WAS ALMOST SEVERED AT THE WRIST AND HIS SILVERY HAIR WAS DABBLED IN BLOOD HIS HEAD HAD BEEN BATTERED IN BY THE FETTERS OF THE PUMA THE BROKEN CANES BENEATH HIM WERE SMEARED WITH BLOOD
HOW THE HAIR BEGAN TO SPREAD OVER THE EXPOSED LIMBS HOW THEIR FOREHEADS FELL AWAY AND THEIR FACES PROJECTED HOW THE QUASI HUMAN INTIMACY I HAD PERMITTED MYSELF WITH SOME OF THEM IN THE FIRST MONTH OF MY LONELINESS BECAME A SHUDDERING HORROR TO RECALL THE CHANGE WAS SLOW AND INEVITABLE
I USED TO GO MOPING ABOUT THE ISLAND TRYING WITH ALL MY MIGHT TO SOLVE THIS ONE LAST DIFFICULTY SOMETIMES I WOULD GIVE WAY TO WILD OUTBURSTS OF RAGE AND HACK AND SPLINTER SOME UNLUCKY TREE IN MY INTOLERABLE VEXATION BUT I COULD THINK OF NOTHING
THE MASTER'S WILL IS SWEET SAID THE DOG MAN WITH THE READY TACT OF HIS CANINE BLOOD BUT ONE HAS SINNED SAID I HIM I WILL KILL WHENEVER I MAY MEET HIM WHEN I SAY TO YOU THAT IS HE SEE THAT YOU FALL UPON HIM
TAKING LITTLE HEED OF THE DIM THINGS THAT PEERED AT US OUT OF THE HUTS NONE ABOUT THE FIRE ATTEMPTED TO SALUTE ME MOST OF THEM DISREGARDED ME OSTENTATIOUSLY I LOOKED ROUND FOR THE HYENA SWINE BUT HE WAS NOT THERE
I HEARD SOMETHING BREATHING SAW SOMETHING CROUCHED TOGETHER CLOSE BESIDE ME I HELD MY BREATH TRYING TO SEE WHAT IT WAS IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY INTERMINABLY THEN SOMETHING SOFT AND WARM AND MOIST PASSED ACROSS MY HAND ALL MY MUSCLES CONTRACTED
THE THING THAT BLED AND RAN SCREAMING AND SOBBING THAT IS DEAD TOO SAID THE GREY THING STILL REGARDING ME THAT'S WELL GRUNTED MONTGOMERY THE OTHER WITH THE WHIP BEGAN THE GREY THING WELL SAID I
I RECOGNISED THE APE MAN I HAD INDEED ALREADY IDENTIFIED HIS VOICE AND TWO OF THE WHITE SWATHED BROWN FEATURED CREATURES I HAD SEEN IN MONTGOMERY'S BOAT
A HEAVY FACELESS THING WITH STRANGE RED EYES LOOKING AT US CURIOUSLY FROM AMIDST THE GREEN FOR A SPACE NO ONE SPOKE THEN MONTGOMERY HICCOUGHED WHO SAID HE WAS DEAD
DURING THAT TIME THEY RESPECTED THE USAGE ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW AND BEHAVED WITH GENERAL DECORUM ONCE I FOUND ANOTHER RABBIT TORN TO PIECES BY THE HYENA SWINE I AM ASSURED BUT THAT WAS ALL
ON CARRY HIM FAR THEY WENT IN UP TO THEIR ARMPITS AND STOOD REGARDING ME LET GO SAID I AND THE BODY OF MONTGOMERY VANISHED WITH A SPLASH SOMETHING SEEMED TO TIGHTEN ACROSS MY CHEST GOOD SAID I WITH A BREAK IN MY VOICE
THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGED ARM SPEAKS A STRANGE THING SAID ONE OF THE BEAST FOLK I TELL YOU IT IS SO I SAID THE MASTER AND THE HOUSE OF PAIN WILL COME AGAIN WOE BE TO HIM WHO BREAKS THE LAW THEY LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT ONE ANOTHER
ONCE I TRIED TO INDUCE THE BEAST FOLK TO HUNT HIM BUT I LACKED THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THEM CO OPERATE FOR ONE END AGAIN AND AGAIN I TRIED TO APPROACH HIS DEN AND COME UPON HIM UNAWARE BUT ALWAYS HE WAS TOO ACUTE FOR ME AND SAW OR WINDED ME AND GOT AWAY HE TOO
IT RETREATED A LITTLE WAY VERY LIKE A DOG BEING SENT HOME AND STOPPED LOOKING AT ME IMPLORINGLY WITH CANINE BROWN EYES
WHAT THE MASTER WISHES TO KILL THE MASTER KILLS SAID THE DOG MAN WITH A CERTAIN SATISFACTION IN HIS VOICE AND THAT THEIR SINS MAY GROW I SAID LET THEM LIVE IN THEIR FOLLY UNTIL THEIR TIME IS RIPE LET THEM NOT KNOW THAT I AM THE MASTER
ALTOGETHER PERHAPS TWENTY OF THE BEAST FOLK SQUATTED STARING INTO THE FIRE OR TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER HE IS DEAD HE IS DEAD THE MASTER IS DEAD SAID THE VOICE OF THE APE MAN TO THE RIGHT OF ME
MONTGOMERY RAISED HIMSELF SLOWLY AND STARED IN A MUDDLED WAY AT THE SHATTERED BEAST MAN BESIDE HIM IT MORE THAN HALF SOBERED HIM HE SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET THEN I SAW THE GREY THING RETURNING CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE TREES SEE SAID I POINTING TO THE DEAD BRUTE
IN THE AFTERNOON THE TIDE STRANDED THE BOAT AND LEFT IT A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO TO THE WESTWARD OF THE RUINS OF THE ENCLOSURE THE MEN IN IT WERE DEAD HAD BEEN DEAD SO LONG THAT THEY FELL TO PIECES WHEN I TILTED THE BOAT ON ITS SIDE AND DRAGGED THEM OUT
TWICE WE HEARD UNSEEN CREATURES HOWLING AND SHRIEKING PAST OUR LITTLE BAND AND ONCE THE LITTLE PINK SLOTH CREATURE APPEARED AND STARED AT US AND VANISHED AGAIN BUT WE WERE NOT ATTACKED AGAIN AT THE GATES OF THE ENCLOSURE OUR COMPANY OF BEAST PEOPLE LEFT US M'LING GOING WITH THE REST
I WAS PERHAPS A DOZEN SECONDS COLLECTING MYSELF THEN CRIED I SALUTE BOW DOWN HIS TEETH FLASHED UPON ME IN A SNARL WHO ARE YOU THAT I SHOULD
WE WERE IN JUST THE STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM THAT WOULD REMAIN IN ONE OF THOSE HAPPY FAMILY CAGES WHICH ANIMAL TAMERS EXHIBIT IF THE TAMER WERE TO LEAVE IT FOR EVER OF COURSE THESE CREATURES DID NOT DECLINE INTO SUCH BEASTS AS THE READER HAS SEEN IN ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
HE IS NOT DEAD HE IS NOT DEAD JABBERED ANOTHER WE SAW WE SAW SAID SEVERAL VOICES HULLO SUDDENLY SHOUTED MONTGOMERY HULLO THERE CONFOUND YOU SAID I AND GRIPPED MY PISTOL
BUT FROM THAT NIGHT UNTIL THE END CAME THERE WAS BUT ONE THING HAPPENED TO TELL SAVE A SERIES OF INNUMERABLE SMALL UNPLEASANT DETAILS AND THE FRETTING OF AN INCESSANT UNEASINESS
IMMEDIATELY AFTER APPEARED A MONSTER IN HEADLONG PURSUIT BLOOD BEDABBLED
IN THE FIRST MONTH OR SO THE BEAST FOLK COMPARED WITH THEIR LATTER CONDITION WERE HUMAN ENOUGH AND FOR ONE OR TWO BESIDES MY CANINE FRIEND I EVEN CONCEIVED A FRIENDLY TOLERANCE THE LITTLE PINK SLOTH CREATURE DISPLAYED AN ODD AFFECTION FOR ME AND TOOK TO FOLLOWING ME ABOUT
HE STOPPED IN THIS CROUCHING ATTITUDE WHEN I TURNED HIS EYES A LITTLE AVERTED FOR A MOMENT WE STOOD EYE TO EYE
I MASTER WHO ARE YOU THEY SAY THERE IS NO MASTER NOW BUT I KNOW I KNOW
I THINK NOW THAT HE WAS THE SILLIEST CREATURE I EVER MET HE HAD DEVELOPED IN THE MOST WONDERFUL WAY THE DISTINCTIVE SILLINESS OF MAN WITHOUT LOSING ONE JOT OF THE NATURAL FOLLY OF A MONKEY
THE OTHERS GATHERED ROUND AND STARED FOR A SPACE AT LAST WE DREW NEAR THE WESTWARD EXTREMITY OF THE ISLAND WE CAME UPON THE GNAWED AND MUTILATED BODY OF THE PUMA ITS SHOULDER BONE SMASHED BY A BULLET AND PERHAPS TWENTY YARDS FARTHER FOUND AT LAST WHAT WE SOUGHT
EVEN NOW THEY TALK TOGETHER BEYOND THERE THEY SAY THE MASTER IS DEAD THE OTHER WITH THE WHIP IS DEAD THAT OTHER WHO WALKED IN THE SEA IS AS WE ARE WE HAVE NO MASTER NO WHIPS NO HOUSE OF PAIN ANY MORE THERE IS AN END
ITS SPRING CARRIED IT OVER ME I FELL UNDER THE HIND PART OF ITS BODY BUT LUCKILY I HAD HIT AS I MEANT AND IT HAD DIED EVEN AS IT LEAPT
THE MASTER YOU CANNOT SEE YET EVEN NOW HE LISTENS AMONG YOU TRUE TRUE SAID THE DOG MAN THEY WERE STAGGERED AT MY ASSURANCE AN ANIMAL MAY BE FEROCIOUS AND CUNNING ENOUGH BUT IT TAKES A REAL MAN TO TELL A LIE
EVERY NOW AND THEN HE LOOKED BACK AT ME OVER HIS SHOULDER HE WENT SLANTING ALONG THE BEACH AND VANISHED BENEATH THE DRIVING MASSES OF DENSE SMOKE THAT WERE STILL POURING OUT FROM THE BURNING ENCLOSURE FOR SOME TIME I STOOD STARING AFTER HIM
MADE EVERY FOREST PATHWAY DANGEROUS TO ME AND MY ALLY WITH HIS LURKING AMBUSCADES
I ALWAYS HAD A BONFIRE READY BUT NO DOUBT THE VOLCANIC REPUTATION OF THE ISLAND WAS TAKEN TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER THAT I BEGAN TO THINK OF MAKING A RAFT BY THAT TIME MY ARM HAD HEALED AND BOTH MY HANDS WERE AT MY SERVICE AGAIN
AND THEY CAME BACK HURRYING AND FEARFUL TO THE MARGIN OF THE WATER LEAVING LONG WAKES OF BLACK IN THE SILVER AT THE WATER'S EDGE THEY STOPPED TURNING AND GLARING INTO THE SEA AS THOUGH THEY PRESENTLY EXPECTED MONTGOMERY TO ARISE THEREFROM AND EXACT VENGEANCE
MONTGOMERY ALMOST STAGGERED INTO HIM AND THEN STOPPED TOO THEN LISTENING INTENTLY WE HEARD COMING THROUGH THE TREES THE SOUND OF VOICES AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING US HE IS DEAD SAID A DEEP VIBRATING VOICE
AND THIS TIME I TOOK CARE OF THE STRENGTH THE ONLY INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE WAS THAT I HAD NO VESSEL TO CONTAIN THE WATER I SHOULD NEED IF I FLOATED FORTH UPON THESE UNTRAVELLED SEAS I WOULD HAVE EVEN TRIED POTTERY BUT THE ISLAND CONTAINED NO CLAY
HE WAS ALREADY MORE THAN HALF FUDDLED I TOLD HIM THAT SOME SERIOUS THING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO MOREAU BY THIS TIME OR HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED BEFORE THIS AND THAT IT BEHOVED US TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THAT CATASTROPHE WAS MONTGOMERY RAISED SOME FEEBLE OBJECTIONS AND AT LAST AGREED
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE BRUTE'S ATTACHMENT TO ME IT WAS SOON EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE FORMER MONSTER HAD TASTED BLOOD AND GONE THE WAY OF THE LEOPARD MAN
THE MONKEY MAN BORED ME HOWEVER HE ASSUMED ON THE STRENGTH OF HIS FIVE DIGITS THAT HE WAS MY EQUAL AND WAS FOR EVER JABBERING AT ME JABBERING THE MOST ARRANT NONSENSE
IN THIS WAY I BECAME ONE AMONG THE BEAST PEOPLE IN THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU WHEN I AWOKE IT WAS DARK ABOUT ME MY ARM ACHED IN ITS BANDAGES I SAT UP WONDERING AT FIRST WHERE I MIGHT BE I HEARD COARSE VOICES TALKING OUTSIDE
BUT AT NIGHT THE AIR WAS HIDEOUS WITH THEIR CALLS AND HOWLING I HAD HALF A MIND TO MAKE A MASSACRE OF THEM TO BUILD TRAPS OR FIGHT THEM WITH MY KNIFE HAD I POSSESSED SUFFICIENT CARTRIDGES I SHOULD NOT HAVE HESITATED TO BEGIN THE KILLING
AND THEN THE OTHERS NONE ATTEMPTED TO RISE OR SALUTE ME I FELT TOO FAINT AND WEARY TO INSIST AND I LET THE MOMENT PASS I WANT FOOD SAID I ALMOST APOLOGETICALLY AND DRAWING NEAR THERE IS FOOD IN THE HUTS SAID AN OX BOAR MAN
I HEARD HIM YELP SAW HIM RUN SIDEWAYS AND TURN KNEW I HAD MISSED AND CLICKED BACK THE COCK WITH MY THUMB FOR THE NEXT SHOT BUT HE WAS ALREADY RUNNING HEADLONG JUMPING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND I DARED NOT RISK ANOTHER MISS
NOW AND THEN SOME BEAST CREATURE WOULD WATCH ME AND GO LEAPING OFF WHEN I CALLED TO IT THERE CAME A SEASON OF THUNDER STORMS AND HEAVY RAIN WHICH GREATLY RETARDED MY WORK BUT AT LAST THE RAFT WAS COMPLETED I WAS DELIGHTED WITH IT
AND SUDDENLY IN A TRAMPLED SPACE I CAME UPON A GHASTLY GROUP MY SAINT BERNARD CREATURE LAY ON THE GROUND DEAD AND NEAR HIS BODY CROUCHED THE HYENA SWINE GRIPPING THE QUIVERING FLESH WITH ITS MISSHAPEN CLAWS GNAWING AT IT AND SNARLING WITH DELIGHT
I BEGAN WALKING ALONG THE BEACH IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION DESIGNING TO COME ROUND THE EASTWARD CORNER OF THE ISLAND AND SO APPROACH THE RAVINE OF THE HUTS WITHOUT TRAVERSING THE POSSIBLE AMBUSCADES OF THE THICKETS
THEY STOOD UP LOOKING QUESTIONINGLY AT ONE ANOTHER STAND THERE SAID I I PICKED UP THE HATCHETS AND SWUNG THEM BY THEIR HEADS FROM THE SLING OF MY ARM TURNED MONTGOMERY OVER PICKED UP HIS REVOLVER STILL LOADED IN TWO CHAMBERS
HIS REVOLVER WE COULD NOT FIND MONTGOMERY TURNED HIM OVER RESTING AT INTERVALS AND WITH THE HELP OF THE SEVEN BEAST PEOPLE FOR HE WAS A HEAVY MAN WE CARRIED MOREAU BACK TO THE ENCLOSURE THE NIGHT WAS DARKLING
SAID I HAVE BROKEN THE LAW THEY WILL DIE SOME HAVE DIED SHOW US NOW WHERE HIS OLD BODY LIES THE BODY HE CAST AWAY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MORE NEED OF IT IT IS THIS WAY MAN WHO WALKED IN THE SEA
THE TRADITION OF THE LAW WAS CLEARLY LOSING ITS FORCE I CANNOT PURSUE THIS DISAGREEABLE SUBJECT MY DOG MAN IMPERCEPTIBLY SLIPPED BACK TO THE DOG AGAIN DAY BY DAY HE BECAME DUMB QUADRUPEDAL HAIRY
ONE OF MY SPASMS OF DISGUST CAME UPON ME I THRUST THE LITTLE BOAT DOWN THE BEACH AND CLAMBERED ON BOARD HER
I AM YOUR SLAVE MASTER ARE YOU THE ONE I MET ON THE BEACH I ASKED THE SAME MASTER THE THING WAS EVIDENTLY FAITHFUL ENOUGH FOR IT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN UPON ME AS I SLEPT
HE HESITATED AS HE APPROACHED GO AWAY CRIED I
WE LOVE THE LAW AND WILL KEEP IT BUT THERE IS NO PAIN NO MASTER NO WHIPS FOR EVER AGAIN SO THEY SAY BUT I KNOW MASTER I KNOW I FELT IN THE DARKNESS AND PATTED THE DOG MAN'S HEAD IT IS WELL I SAID AGAIN
THAT DANGER AT LEAST WAS OVER BUT THIS I KNEW WAS ONLY THE FIRST OF THE SERIES OF RELAPSES THAT MUST COME I BURNT BOTH OF THE BODIES ON A PYRE OF BRUSHWOOD BUT AFTER THAT I SAW THAT UNLESS I LEFT THE ISLAND MY DEATH WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME
SLOWLY SLOWLY THE BOAT DROVE PAST TOWARDS THE WEST
AT FIRST I SPENT THE DAYLIGHT HOURS ON THE SOUTHWARD BEACH WATCHING FOR A SHIP HOPING AND PRAYING FOR A SHIP I COUNTED ON THE IPECACUANHA RETURNING AS THE YEAR WORE ON BUT SHE NEVER CAME FIVE TIMES I SAW SAILS AND THRICE SMOKE BUT NOTHING EVER TOUCHED THE ISLAND
THOUGH THEY EVIDENTLY FELT ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES EVERY NOW AND THEN I WOULD COME UPON ONE OR ANOTHER RUNNING ON TOES AND FINGER TIPS AND QUITE UNABLE TO RECOVER THE VERTICAL ATTITUDE THEY HELD THINGS MORE CLUMSILY DRINKING BY SUCTION FEEDING BY GNAWING GREW COMMONER EVERY DAY
DROWSILY AND LOOKING AWAY FROM ME I PASSED THEM AND WENT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW AND ODOURS OF THE ALMOST DESERTED RAVINE IN AN EMPTY HUT I FEASTED ON SOME SPECKED AND HALF DECAYED FRUIT AND THEN AFTER I HAD PROPPED SOME BRANCHES AND STICKS ABOUT THE OPENING
AMONG THE CHIPS SCATTERED ABOUT THE BEACH LAY THE TWO AXES THAT HAD BEEN USED TO CHOP UP THE BOATS THE TIDE WAS CREEPING IN BEHIND ME THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT COURAGE I LOOKED SQUARELY INTO THE FACES OF THE ADVANCING MONSTERS
THE EXHAUSTION OF THE LAST THIRTY HOURS CLAIMED ITS OWN AND I FELL INTO A LIGHT SLUMBER
AND THERE I SAT CHIN ON KNEES THE SUN BEATING DOWN UPON MY HEAD AND UNSPEAKABLE DREAD IN MY MIND PLOTTING HOW I COULD LIVE ON AGAINST THE HOUR OF MY RESCUE IF EVER RESCUE CAME
I SCARCELY NOTICED THE TRANSITION FROM THE COMPANION ON MY RIGHT HAND TO THE LURCHING DOG AT MY SIDE AS THE CARELESSNESS AND DISORGANISATION INCREASED FROM DAY TO DAY THE LANE OF DWELLING PLACES AT NO TIME VERY SWEET BECAME SO LOATHSOME THAT I LEFT IT
BUT MY HEART FAILED ME I WENT BACK TO THE BEACH AND TURNING EASTWARD PAST THE BURNING ENCLOSURE MADE FOR A POINT WHERE A SHALLOW SPIT OF CORAL SAND RAN OUT TOWARDS THE REEF HERE I COULD SIT DOWN AND THINK
THEY HAVE BEEN SLAIN EVEN THE SAYER OF THE LAW EVEN THE OTHER WITH THE WHIP GREAT IS THE LAW COME AND SEE NONE ESCAPE SAID ONE OF THEM ADVANCING AND PEERING NONE ESCAPE SAID I THEREFORE HEAR AND DO AS I COMMAND
I HEARD A LIGHT FOOTFALL BEHIND ME AND TURNING QUICKLY SAW THE BIG HYENA SWINE PERHAPS A DOZEN YARDS AWAY HIS HEAD WAS BENT DOWN HIS BRIGHT EYES WERE FIXED UPON ME HIS STUMPY HANDS CLENCHED AND HELD CLOSE BY HIS SIDE
TAKE GOOD AT GOD'S HANDS AND NOT BE CONTENT TO TAKE EVIL ALSO AND SO OF FRIENDS IN A PROPORTION THIS IS CERTAIN THAT A MAN THAT STUDIETH REVENGE KEEPS HIS OWN WOUNDS GREEN
AND LET THEM NOT TOO MUCH APPLY THEMSELVES TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR CHILDREN AS THINKING THEY WILL TAKE BEST TO THAT
SAILED THE LENGTH OF THE GREAT OCEAN IN AN EARTHEN POT OR PITCHER LIVELY DESCRIBING CHRISTIAN RESOLUTION THAT SAILETH IN THE FRAIL BARK OF THE FLESH THROUGH THE WAVES OF THE WORLD BUT TO SPEAK IN A MEAN
THE FRENCH HATH IT BETTER ENTREPRENANT OR REMUANT BUT THE EXERCISED FORTUNE MAKETH THE ABLE MAN FORTUNE IS TO BE HONORED AND RESPECTED
LET NOT A MAN FORCE A HABIT UPON HIMSELF WITH A PERPETUAL CONTINUANCE BUT WITH SOME INTERMISSION FOR BOTH THE PAUSE REINFORCETH THE NEW ONSET AND IF A MAN THAT IS NOT PERFECT BE EVER IN PRACTICE
IN FEW WORDS MYSTERIES ARE DUE TO SECRECY BESIDES TO SAY TRUTH NAKEDNESS IS UNCOMELY AS WELL IN MIND AS BODY
IN CREATING AND BREEDING AN EMULATION BETWEEN BROTHERS DURING CHILDHOOD WHICH MANY TIMES SORTETH TO DISCORD WHEN THEY ARE MEN AND DISTURBETH FAMILIES
AND DISSIMULATION TO TIBERIUS
BUT AFTER A TIME LET HIM PRACTISE WITH DISADVANTAGES AS DANCERS DO WITH THICK SHOES FOR IT BREEDS GREAT PERFECTION IF THE PRACTICE BE HARDER THAN THE USE WHERE NATURE IS MIGHTY AND THEREFORE THE VICTORY HARD
IT FOLLOWETH MANY TIMES UPON SECRECY BY A NECESSITY SO THAT HE THAT WILL BE SECRET MUST BE A DISSEMBLER IN SOME DEGREE FOR MEN ARE TOO CUNNING TO SUFFER A MAN TO KEEP AN INDIFFERENT CARRIAGE BETWEEN BOTH
IT IS TRUE THAT IF THE AFFECTION OR APTNESS OF THE CHILDREN BE EXTRAORDINARY THEN IT IS GOOD NOT TO CROSS IT BUT GENERALLY THE PRECEPT IS GOOD OPTIMUM
THAT THOSE THINGS WHICH I HERE SET DOWN ARE SUCH AS DO NATURALLY TAKE THE SENSE AND NOT RESPECT PETTY WONDERMENTS IT IS TRUE THE ALTERATIONS OF SCENES SO IT BE QUIETLY AND WITHOUT NOISE ARE THINGS OF GREAT BEAUTY AND PLEASURE
FOR THEY FEED AND RELIEVE THE EYE BEFORE IT BE FULL OF THE SAME OBJECT LET THE SCENES ABOUND WITH LIGHT SPECIALLY COLORED AND VARIED AND LET THE MASQUERS OR ANY OTHER
THE FORCE OF CUSTOM IS IN HIS EXALTATION CERTAINLY THE GREAT MULTIPLICATION OF VIRTUES UPON HUMAN NATURE RESTETH UPON SOCIETIES WELL ORDAINED AND DISCIPLINED
AND AS IN CONFESSION THE REVEALING IS NOT FOR WORLDLY USE BUT FOR THE EASE OF A MAN'S HEART SO SECRET MEN COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF MANY THINGS IN THAT KIND WHILE MEN RATHER DISCHARGE THEIR MINDS THAN IMPART THEIR MINDS
CERTAINLY THE ABLEST MEN THAT EVER WERE HAVE HAD ALL AN OPENNESS AND FRANKNESS OF DEALING
FOR CHARITY WILL HARDLY WATER THE GROUND WHERE IT MUST FIRST FILL A POOL IT IS INDIFFERENT FOR JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES FOR IF THEY BE FACILE AND CORRUPT YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT FIVE TIMES WORSE THAN A WIFE
ELSE A MAN'S ENEMY IS STILL BEFORE HAND AND IT IS TWO FOR ONE SOME WHEN THEY TAKE REVENGE ARE DESIROUS THE PARTY SHOULD KNOW WHENCE IT COMETH THIS IS THE MORE GENEROUS FOR THE DELIGHT SEEMETH TO BE
AND IT BE BUT FOR HER DAUGHTERS CONFIDENCE AND REPUTATION FOR THOSE TWO FELICITY BREEDETH THE FIRST WITHIN A MAN'S SELF THE LATTER IN OTHERS TOWARDS HIM ALL WISE MEN TO DECLINE THE ENVY OF THEIR OWN VIRTUES
AND WHAT TO BE SHOWED AT HALF LIGHTS AND TO WHOM AND WHEN WHICH INDEED ARE ARTS OF STATE AND ARTS OF LIFE AS TACITUS WELL CALLETH THEM TO HIM A HABIT OF DISSIMULATION IS A HINDERANCE AND A POORNESS
WHETHER IT BE THAT IT RAISETH THE PRICE OF THEIR HUSBAND'S KINDNESS WHEN IT COMES OR THAT THE WIVES TAKE A PRIDE IN THEIR PATIENCE BUT THIS NEVER FAILS IF THE BAD HUSBANDS WERE OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING AGAINST THEIR FRIENDS CONSENT
OF THEIR GOOD FAITH AND CLEARNESS OF DEALING MADE THEM ALMOST INVISIBLE THERE BE THREE DEGREES OF THIS HIDING AND VEILING OF A MAN'S SELF THE FIRST CLOSENESS RESERVATION AND SECRECY
WERE WONT TO BE SCOURGED UPON THE ALTAR OF DIANA WITHOUT SO MUCH AS QUECHING I REMEMBER IN THE BEGINNING OF QUEEN ELIZABETH'S TIME OF ENGLAND AN IRISH REBEL CONDEMNED PUT UP A PETITION TO THE DEPUTY
PLACED ALOFT AND ACCOMPANIED WITH SOME BROKEN MUSIC AND THE DITTY FITTED TO THE DEVICE ACTING IN SONG ESPECIALLY IN DIALOGUES HATH AN EXTREME GOOD GRACE I SAY ACTING NOT DANCING
THAT HE MIGHT BE HANGED IN A WITHE AND NOT IN AN HALTER BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN SO USED WITH FORMER REBELS THERE BE MONKS IN RUSSIA FOR PENANCE THAT WILL SIT A WHOLE NIGHT IN A VESSEL OF WATER
BY THE PLEASURE OF THE EYE CERTAINLY VIRTUE IS LIKE PRECIOUS ODORS MOST FRAGRANT WHEN THEY ARE INCENSED OR CRUSHED FOR PROSPERITY DOTH BEST DISCOVER VICE BUT ADVERSITY DOTH BEST DISCOVER VIRTUE
NOT SO MUCH IN DOING THE HURT AS IN MAKING THE PARTY REPENT BUT BASE AND CRAFTY COWARDS ARE LIKE THE ARROW THAT FLIETH IN THE DARK
AND THEREFORE IT IS A GOOD SHREWD PROVERB OF THE SPANIARD TELL A LIE AND FIND A TROTH AS IF THERE WERE NO WAY OF DISCOVERY BUT BY SIMULATION THERE BE ALSO THREE DISADVANTAGES TO SET IT EVEN THE FIRST
FOR JUSTS AND TOURNEYS AND BARRIERS THE GLORIES OF THEM ARE CHIEFLY IN THE CHARIOTS WHEREIN THE CHALLENGERS MAKE THEIR ENTRY ESPECIALLY IF THEY BE DRAWN WITH STRANGE BEASTS AS LIONS BEARS CAMELS AND THE LIKE
LET THE SUITS OF THE MASQUERS BE GRACEFUL AND SUCH AS BECOME THE PERSON WHEN THE VIZORS ARE OFF NOT AFTER EXAMPLES OF KNOWN ATTIRES TURKE SOLDIERS MARINERS AND THE LIKE
WHICH CARRIETH THE GREATER BENEDICTION AND THE CLEARER REVELATION OF GOD'S FAVOR YET EVEN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT IF YOU LISTEN TO DAVID'S HARP YOU SHALL HEAR AS MANY HEARSE LIKE AIRS AS CAROLS AND THE PENCIL OF THE HOLY GHOST
WHICH SEEMETH NOT TO BE WITHOUT MYSTERY NAY AND TO HAVE SOME APPROACH TO THE STATE OF A CHRISTIAN THAT HERCULES WHEN HE WENT TO UNBIND PROMETHEUS BY WHOM HUMAN NATURE IS REPRESENTED
BUT THEN THEY WERE LIKE HORSES WELL MANAGED FOR THEY COULD TELL PASSING WELL WHEN TO STOP OR TURN AND AT SUCH TIMES WHEN THEY THOUGHT THE CASE INDEED REQUIRED DISSIMULATION IF THEN THEY USED IT IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE FORMER OPINION SPREAD ABROAD
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE AS UNFIT BUT CHIEFLY LET THE MUSIC OF THEM BE RECREATIVE AND WITH SOME STRANGE CHANGES SOME SWEET ODORS SUDDENLY COMING FORTH WITHOUT ANY DROPS FALLING ARE
A WISE SON REJOICETH THE FATHER BUT AN UNGRACIOUS SON SHAMES THE MOTHER A MAN SHALL SEE WHERE THERE IS A HOUSE FULL OF CHILDREN ONE OR TWO OF THE ELDEST RESPECTED AND THE YOUNGEST MADE WANTONS BUT IN THE MIDST
THE WAY OF FORTUNE IS LIKE THE MILKEN WAY IN THE SKY WHICH IS A MEETING OR KNOT OF A NUMBER OF SMALL STARS NOT SEEN ASUNDER BUT GIVING LIGHT TOGETHER
OF CUSTOM AND EDUCATION MEN'S THOUGHTS ARE MUCH ACCORDING TO THEIR INCLINATION THEIR DISCOURSE AND SPEECHES ACCORDING TO THEIR LEARNING AND INFUSED OPINIONS BUT THEIR DEEDS
REVENGE IS A KIND OF WILD JUSTICE WHICH THE MORE MAN'S NATURE RUNS TO THE MORE OUGHT LAW TO WEED IT OUT FOR AS FOR THE FIRST WRONG IT DOTH BUT OFFEND THE LAW
PORTAS ET FORTUNAM EJUS SO SYLLA CHOSE THE NAME OF FELIX AND NOT OF MAGNUS AND IT HATH BEEN NOTED THAT THOSE WHO ASCRIBE OPENLY TOO MUCH TO THEIR OWN WISDOM AND POLICY
AND IT ADDETH NO SMALL REVERENCE TO MEN'S MANNERS AND ACTIONS IF THEY BE NOT ALTOGETHER OPEN AS FOR TALKERS AND FUTILE PERSONS THEY ARE COMMONLY VAIN AND CREDULOUS WITHAL FOR HE THAT TALKETH WHAT HE KNOWETH
LET HIM SEASONABLY WATER THE ONE AND DESTROY THE OTHER
GRAVE NATURES LED BY CUSTOM AND THEREFORE CONSTANT ARE COMMONLY LOVING HUSBANDS AS WAS SAID OF ULYSSES VETULAM SUAM PRAETULIT IMMORTALITATI CHASTE WOMEN
THAT SIMULATION AND DISSIMULATION COMMONLY CARRY WITH THEM A SHOW OF FEARFULNESS WHICH IN ANY BUSINESS DOTH SPOIL THE FEATHERS OF ROUND FLYING UP TO THE MARK THE SECOND THAT IT PUZZLETH AND PERPLEXETH THE CONCEITS OF MANY
A GENERAL CUSTOM OF SIMULATION WHICH IS THIS LAST DEGREE IS A VICE USING EITHER OF A NATURAL FALSENESS OR FEARFULNESS OR OF A MIND THAT HATH SOME MAIN FAULTS WHICH BECAUSE A MAN MUST NEEDS DISGUISE
HAVE SOME MOTIONS UPON THE SCENE ITSELF BEFORE THEIR COMING DOWN FOR IT DRAWS THE EYE STRANGELY AND MAKES IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE TO DESIRE TO SEE THAT IT CANNOT PERFECTLY DISCERN
FOR SOLDIERS I FIND THE GENERALS COMMONLY IN THEIR HORTATIVES PUT MEN IN MIND OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN AND I THINK THE DESPISING OF MARRIAGE AMONGST THE TURKS MAKETH THE VULGAR SOLDIER MORE BASE
OR IN THE DEVICES OF THEIR ENTRANCE OR IN THE BRAVERY OF THEIR LIVERIES OR IN THE GOODLY FURNITURE OF THEIR HORSES AND ARMOR BUT ENOUGH OF THESE TOYS
FOR NATURE WILL LAY BURIED A GREAT TIME AND YET REVIVE UPON THE OCCASION OR TEMPTATION LIKE AS IT WAS WITH A ESOP'S DAMSEL TURNED FROM A CAT TO A WOMAN WHO SAT VERY DEMURELY AT THE BOARD'S END TILL A MOUSE RAN BEFORE HER
SO ARE THERE A NUMBER OF LITTLE AND SCARCE DISCERNED VIRTUES OR RATHER FACULTIES AND CUSTOMS THAT MAKE MEN FORTUNATE THE ITALIANS NOTE SOME OF THEM SUCH AS A MAN WOULD LITTLE THINK WHEN THEY SPEAK OF ONE THAT CANNOT DO AMISS
IT MAKETH HIM PRACTISE SIMULATION IN OTHER THINGS LEST HIS HAND SHOULD BE OUT OF USE THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF SIMULATION AND DISSIMULATION ARE THREE FIRST TO LAY ASLEEP OPPOSITION AND TO SURPRISE
OF ADVERSITY IT WAS AN HIGH SPEECH OF SENECA AFTER THE MANNER OF THE STOICS THAT THE GOOD THINGS WHICH BELONG TO PROSPERITY ARE TO BE WISHED BUT THE GOOD THINGS THAT BELONG TO ADVERSITY ARE TO BE ADMIRED
BUT MEMORY MERIT AND NOBLE WORKS ARE PROPER TO MEN AND SURELY A MAN SHALL SEE THE NOBLEST WORKS AND FOUNDATIONS HAVE PROCEEDED FROM CHILDLESS MEN WHICH HAVE SOUGHT TO EXPRESS THE IMAGES OF THEIR MINDS WHERE THOSE OF THEIR BODIES HAVE FAILED
THIS WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER IN POESY WHERE TRANSCENDENCES ARE MORE ALLOWED AND THE POETS INDEED HAVE BEEN BUSY WITH IT FOR IT IS IN EFFECT THE THING WHICH FIGURED IN THAT STRANGE FICTION OF THE ANCIENT POETS
HE SHALL AS WELL PRACTISE HIS ERRORS AS HIS ABILITIES AND INDUCE ONE HABIT OF BOTH AND THERE IS NO MEANS TO HELP THIS BUT BY SEASONABLE INTERMISSIONS BUT LET NOT A MAN TRUST HIS VICTORY OVER HIS NATURE TOO FAR
WHO MANY TIMES NEVERTHELESS PROVE THE BEST THE ILLIBERALITY OF PARENTS IN ALLOWANCE TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN IS AN HARMFUL ERROR MAKES THEM BASE ACQUAINTS THEM WITH SHIFTS MAKES THEM SORT WITH MEAN COMPANY
THE DEGREES HAD NEED BE FIRST TO STAY AND ARREST NATURE IN TIME LIKE TO HIM THAT WOULD SAY OVER THE FOUR AND TWENTY LETTERS WHEN HE WAS ANGRY THEN TO GO LESS IN QUANTITY AS IF ONE SHOULD IN FORBEARING WINE
WILL ALSO TALK WHAT HE KNOWETH NOT THEREFORE SET IT DOWN THAT AN HABIT OF SECRECY IS BOTH POLITIC AND MORAL AND IN THIS PART IT IS GOOD THAT A MAN'S FACE GIVE HIS TONGUE LEAVE TO SPEAK
SEVERAL QUIRES PLACED ONE OVER AGAINST ANOTHER AND TAKING THE VOICE BY CATCHES ANTHEM WISE GIVE GREAT PLEASURE TURNING DANCES INTO FIGURE IS A CHILDISH CURIOSITY AND GENERALLY LET IT BE NOTED
YET THEIR THOUGHTS DO END WITH THEMSELVES AND ACCOUNT FUTURE TIMES IMPERTINENCES NAY THERE ARE SOME OTHER THAT ACCOUNT WIFE AND CHILDREN BUT AS BILLS OF CHARGES NAY MORE
TO TAKE ARMS AGAINST VITELLIUS HE SAITH WE RISE NOT AGAINST THE PIERCING JUDGMENT OF AUGUSTUS NOR THE EXTREME CAUTION OR CLOSENESS OF TIBERIUS THESE PROPERTIES OF ARTS OR POLICY
OF NATURE IN MEN NATURE IS OFTEN HIDDEN SOMETIMES OVERCOME SELDOM EXTINGUISHED FORCE MAKETH NATURE MORE VIOLENT IN THE RETURN DOCTRINE AND DISCOURSE
THERE ARE SOME FOOLISH RICH COVETOUS MEN THAT TAKE A PRIDE IN HAVING NO CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY MAY BE THOUGHT SO MUCH THE RICHER FOR PERHAPS THEY HAVE HEARD SOME TALK SUCH AN ONE IS A GREAT RICH MAN
WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD HEAL AND DO WELL PUBLIC REVENGES ARE FOR THE MOST PART FORTUNATE AS THAT FOR THE DEATH OF CAESAR FOR THE DEATH OF PERTINAX FOR THE DEATH OF HENRY THE THIRD OF FRANCE AND MANY MORE
BUT IN PRIVATE REVENGES IT IS NOT SO NAY RATHER VINDICTIVE PERSONS LIVE THE LIFE OF WITCHES WHO AS THEY ARE MISCHIEVOUS SO END THEY INFORTUNATE
MAKETH NATURE LESS IMPORTUNE BUT CUSTOM ONLY DOTH ALTER AND SUBDUE NATURE HE THAT SEEKETH VICTORY OVER HIS NATURE LET HIM NOT SET HIMSELF TOO GREAT NOR TOO SMALL TASKS
FOR THE FIRST WILL MAKE HIM DEJECTED BY OFTEN FAILINGS AND THE SECOND WILL MAKE HIM A SMALL PROCEEDER THOUGH BY OFTEN PREVAILINGS AND AT THE FIRST LET HIM PRACTISE WITH HELPS AS SWIMMERS DO WITH BLADDERS OR RUSHES
AND MAKES THEM SURFEIT MORE WHEN THEY COME TO PLENTY AND THEREFORE THE PROOF IS BEST WHEN MEN KEEP THEIR AUTHORITY TOWARDS THE CHILDREN BUT NOT THEIR PURSE MEN HAVE A FOOLISH MANNER BOTH PARENTS AND SCHOOLMASTERS AND SERVANTS
THE SPANISH NAME DESEMBOLTURA PARTLY EXPRESSETH THEM WHEN THERE BE NOT STONDS NOR RESTIVENESS IN A MAN'S NATURE BUT THAT THE WHEELS OF HIS MIND KEEP WAY WITH THE WHEELS OF HIS FORTUNE
IN PASSION FOR THAT PUTTETH A MAN OUT OF HIS PRECEPTS AND IN A NEW CASE OR EXPERIMENT FOR THERE CUSTOM LEAVETH HIM THEY ARE HAPPY MEN WHOSE NATURES SORT WITH THEIR VOCATIONS OTHERWISE THEY MAY SAY
AS PLUTARCH SAITH OF TIMOLEON'S FORTUNE IN RESPECT OF THAT OF
EXCEPT IT BE IN SOME MINDS THAT HAVE NOT SUFFERED THEMSELVES TO FIX BUT HAVE KEPT THEMSELVES OPEN AND PREPARED TO RECEIVE CONTINUAL AMENDMENT WHICH IS EXCEEDING RARE BUT IF THE FORCE OF CUSTOM SIMPLE AND SEPARATE BE GREAT
FOR COMMONWEALTHS AND GOOD GOVERNMENTS DO NOURISH VIRTUE GROWN BUT DO NOT MUCH MEND THE DEEDS BUT THE MISERY IS THAT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS ARE NOW APPLIED TO THE ENDS LEAST TO BE DESIRED
THEREFORE EXTREME LOVERS OF THEIR COUNTRY OR MASTERS WERE NEVER FORTUNATE NEITHER CAN THEY BE FOR WHEN A MAN PLACETH HIS THOUGHTS WITHOUT HIMSELF HE GOETH NOT HIS OWN WAY AN HASTY FORTUNE MAKETH AN ENTERPRISER AND REMOVER
OF FORTUNE IT CANNOT BE DENIED BUT OUTWARD ACCIDENTS CONDUCE MUCH TO FORTUNE FAVOR OPPORTUNITY DEATH OF OTHERS OCCASION FITTING VIRTUE BUT CHIEFLY THE MOULD OF A MAN'S FORTUNE IS IN HIS OWN HANDS
FOR HIS THOUGHTS WILL FLY TO IT OF THEMSELVES SO AS THE SPACES OF OTHER BUSINESS OR STUDIES WILL SUFFICE A MAN'S NATURE RUNS EITHER TO HERBS OR WEEDS THEREFORE
THEY WILL GATHER AS MUCH BY HIS SILENCE AS BY HIS SPEECH AS FOR EQUIVOCATIONS OR ORACULOUS SPEECHES THEY CANNOT HOLD OUT LONG SO THAT NO MAN CAN BE SECRET EXCEPT HE GIVE HIMSELF A LITTLE SCOPE OF DISSIMULATION WHICH IS
SHOULD HAVE GREATEST CARE OF FUTURE TIMES UNTO WHICH THEY KNOW THEY MUST TRANSMIT THEIR DEAREST PLEDGES SOME THERE ARE WHO THOUGH THEY LEAD A SINGLE LIFE
AS IF THEY WERE DEAD IMAGES AND ENGINES MOVED ONLY BY THE WHEELS OF CUSTOM WE SEE ALSO THE REIGN OR TYRANNY OF CUSTOM WHAT IT IS THE INDIANS I MEAN THE SECT OF THEIR WISE MEN
HE MUST GO THROUGH OR TAKE A FALL THE THIRD IS THE BETTER TO DISCOVER THE MIND OF ANOTHER FOR TO HIM THAT OPENS HIMSELF MEN WILL HARDLY SHOW THEMSELVES ADVERSE BUT WILL FAIR LET HIM GO ON AND TURN THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
THEREFORE LET A MAN EITHER AVOID THE OCCASION ALTOGETHER OR PUT HIMSELF OFTEN TO IT THAT HE MAY BE LITTLE MOVED WITH IT A MAN'S NATURE IS BEST PERCEIVED IN PRIVATENESS FOR THERE IS NO AFFECTATION
THEREFORE IT IS THE WEAKER SORT OF POLITICS THAT ARE THE GREAT DISSEMBLERS TACITUS SAITH LIVIA SORTED WELL WITH THE ARTS OF HER HUSBAND AND DISSIMULATION OF HER SON ATTRIBUTING ARTS OR POLICY TO AUGUSTUS
ONLY SUPERSTITION IS NOW SO WELL ADVANCED THAT MEN OF THE FIRST BLOOD ARE AS FIRM AS BUTCHERS BY OCCUPATION AND VOTARY RESOLUTION IS MADE EQUIPOLLENT TO CUSTOM EVEN IN MATTER OF BLOOD
FALLETH UPON THAT THAT HE HAD VERSATILE INGENIUM THEREFORE IF A MAN LOOK SHARPLY AND ATTENTIVELY HE SHALL SEE FORTUNE FOR THOUGH SHE BE BLIND YET SHE IS NOT INVISIBLE
IN OTHER THINGS THE PREDOMINANCY OF CUSTOM IS EVERYWHERE VISIBLE INSOMUCH AS A MAN WOULD WONDER TO HEAR MEN PROFESS PROTEST ENGAGE GIVE GREAT WORDS AND THEN DO JUST AS THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE
ARE AFTER AS THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED AND THEREFORE AS MACHIAVEL WELL NOTETH THOUGH IN AN EVIL FAVORED INSTANCE THERE IS NO TRUSTING TO THE FORCE OF NATURE NOR TO THE BRAVERY OF WORDS EXCEPT IT BE CORROBORATE BY CUSTOM
NEVER PROSPERED IN ANYTHING HE UNDERTOOK AFTERWARDS CERTAINLY THERE BE WHOSE FORTUNES ARE LIKE HOMER'S VERSES THAT HAVE A SLIDE AND EASINESS MORE THAN THE VERSES OF OTHER POETS
THE FORCE OF CUSTOM COPULATE AND CONJOINED AND COLLEGIATE IS FAR GREATER FOR THERE EXAMPLE TEACHETH COMPANY COMFORTETH EMULATION QUICKENETH GLORY RAISETH SO AS IN SUCH PLACES
BUT YET SINCE PRINCES WILL HAVE SUCH THINGS IT IS BETTER THEY SHOULD BE GRACED WITH ELEGANCY THAN DAUBED WITH COST DANCING TO SONG IS A THING OF GREAT STATE AND PLEASURE I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THE SONG BE IN QUIRE
THE VIRTUE OF PROSPERITY IS TEMPERANCE THE VIRTUE OF ADVERSITY IS FORTITUDE WHICH IN MORALS IS THE MORE HEROICAL VIRTUE PROSPERITY IS THE BLESSING OF THE OLD TESTAMENT ADVERSITY IS THE BLESSING OF THE NEW
COSMUS DUKE OF FLORENCE HAD A DESPERATE SAYING AGAINST PERFIDIOUS OR NEGLECTING FRIENDS AS IF THOSE WRONGS WERE UNPARDONABLE YOU SHALL READ SAITH HE THAT WE ARE COMMANDED TO FORGIVE OUR ENEMIES
FOR WHERE A MAN'S INTENTIONS ARE PUBLISHED IT IS AN ALARUM TO CALL UP ALL THAT ARE AGAINST THEM THE SECOND IS TO RESERVE TO A MAN'S SELF A FAIR RETREAT FOR IF A MAN ENGAGE HIMSELF BY A MANIFEST DECLARATION
THE BEST COMPOSITION AND TEMPERATURE IS TO HAVE OPENNESS IN FAME AND OPINION SECRECY IN HABIT DISSIMULATION IN SEASONABLE USE AND A POWER TO FEIGN IF THERE BE NO REMEDY
IN SUCH A COMPANY AS THERE IS STEAM AND HEAT THINGS OF GREAT PLEASURE AND REFRESHMENT DOUBLE MASQUES ONE OF MEN ANOTHER OF LADIES ADDETH STATE AND VARIETY BUT ALL IS NOTHING EXCEPT THE ROOM BE KEPT CLEAR AND NEAT
AND ASSUREDLY THE SECRET MAN HEARETH MANY CONFESSIONS FOR WHO WILL OPEN HIMSELF TO A BLAB OR A BABBLER BUT IF A MAN BE THOUGHT SECRET IT INVITETH DISCOVERY AS THE MORE CLOSE AIR SUCKETH IN THE MORE OPEN
WHICH PRICK AND SCRATCH BECAUSE THEY CAN DO NO OTHER THE MOST TOLERABLE SORT OF REVENGE
NEITHER IS THE ANCIENT RULE AMISS TO BEND NATURE AS A WAND TO A CONTRARY EXTREME WHEREBY TO SET IT RIGHT UNDERSTANDING IT WHERE THE CONTRARY EXTREME IS NO VICE
TILL THEY BE ENGAGED WITH HARD ICE MANY EXAMPLES MAY BE PUT OF THE FORCE OF CUSTOM BOTH UPON MIND AND BODY THEREFORE SINCE CUSTOM IS THE PRINCIPAL MAGISTRATE OF MAN'S LIFE
ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN SELF PLEASING AND HUMOROUS MINDS WHICH ARE SO SENSIBLE OF EVERY RESTRAINT AS THEY WILL GO NEAR TO THINK THEIR GIRDLES AND GARTERS TO BE BONDS AND SHACKLES UNMARRIED MEN ARE BEST FRIENDS
AND ANOTHER EXCEPT TO IT YEA BUT HE HATH A GREAT CHARGE OF CHILDREN AS IF IT WERE AN ABATEMENT TO HIS RICHES BUT THE MOST ORDINARY CAUSE OF A SINGLE LIFE IS LIBERTY
BECAUSE THEIR MEANS ARE LESS EXHAUST YET ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY ARE MORE CRUEL AND HARDHEARTED GOOD TO MAKE SEVERE INQUISITORS BECAUSE THEIR TENDERNESS IS NOT SO OFT CALLED UPON
COMEDERIT NON FIT DRACO OVERT AND APPARENT VIRTUES BRING FORTH PRAISE BUT THERE BE SECRET AND HIDDEN VIRTUES THAT BRING FORTH FORTUNE CERTAIN DELIVERIES OF A MAN'S SELF WHICH HAVE NO NAME
FOR SO LIVY AFTER HE HAD DESCRIBED CATO MAJOR IN THESE WORDS
BUT SO THEY BE OF THE LUMP THEY CARE NOT THOUGH THEY PASS NOT THROUGH THEIR OWN BODY AND TO SAY TRUTH IN NATURE IT IS MUCH A LIKE MATTER INSOMUCH THAT WE SEE A NEPHEW SOMETIMES RESEMBLETH AN UNCLE OR A KINSMAN
USE TO ASCRIBE THEM TO PROVIDENCE AND FORTUNE FOR SO THEY MAY THE BETTER ASSUME THEM AND BESIDES IT IS GREATNESS IN A MAN TO BE THE CARE OF THE HIGHER POWERS SO CAESAR SAID TO THE PILOT IN THE TEMPEST
AS IT WERE BUT THE SKIRTS OR TRAIN OF SECRECY BUT FOR THE THIRD DEGREE WHICH IS SIMULATION AND FALSE PROFESSION THAT I HOLD MORE CULPABLE AND LESS POLITIC EXCEPT IT BE IN GREAT AND RARE MATTERS AND THEREFORE
WE SEE IN NEEDLE WORKS AND EMBROIDERIES IT IS MORE PLEASING TO HAVE A LIVELY WORK UPON A SAD AND SOLEMN GROUND THAN TO HAVE A DARK AND MELANCHOLY WORK UPON A LIGHTSOME GROUND JUDGE THEREFORE OF THE PLEASURE OF THE HEART
BUT YOU NEVER READ THAT WE ARE COMMANDED TO FORGIVE OUR FRIENDS BUT YET THE SPIRIT OF JOB WAS IN A BETTER TUNE
THE TONGUE IS MORE PLIANT TO ALL EXPRESSIONS AND SOUNDS THE JOINTS ARE MORE SUPPLE TO ALL FEATS OF ACTIVITY AND MOTIONS IN YOUTH THAN AFTERWARDS FOR IT IS TRUE THAT LATE LEARNERS CANNOT SO WELL TAKE THE PLY
BUT OF THEIR WORK AND SO BOTH CHILDREN AND CREATURES THE DIFFERENCE IN AFFECTION OF PARENTS TOWARDS THEIR SEVERAL CHILDREN IS MANY TIMES UNEQUAL AND SOMETIMES UNWORTHY ESPECIALLY IN THE MOTHERS AS SOLOMON SAITH
EVEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE NOTICED ME SO COMPLETELY WAS HE IMMERSED IN HIS TRANCE I INCHED OVER THE CARPET AVOIDING THE TINIEST BUMP WHOSE NOISE MIGHT GIVE ME AWAY
BUT WAS OPPOSED BY SOME PRINCES WHO DREADED ITS INTRODUCTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISORDERS AND MADNESS IT BROUGHT WITH IT AS HE APPROACHED HIS NATIVE CITY THEBES PENTHEUS THE KING
WHAT WAS HE DOING JUST THEN I LISTENED AT THE DOOR TO HIS STATEROOM I HEARD THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS CAPTAIN NEMO WAS INSIDE HE HADN'T GONE TO BED
ENOUGH ENOUGH WAS IT A VOW OF REPENTANCE THAT HAD JUST ESCAPED FROM THIS MAN'S CONSCIENCE FRANTIC I RUSHED INTO THE LIBRARY
THE GOD WOULD HAVE STOPPED HER AS SHE SPAKE BUT SHE WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM THE WORDS ESCAPED AND HE COULD NEITHER UNSAY HIS PROMISE NOR HER REQUEST IN DEEP DISTRESS HE LEFT HER AND RETURNED TO THE UPPER REGIONS
ITS STEEL MUSCLES WERE CRACKING SOMETIMES IT STOOD ON END THE THREE OF US ALONG WITH IT WE'VE GOT TO HOLD ON TIGHT NED SAID AND SCREW THE NUTS DOWN AGAIN IF WE CAN STAY ATTACHED TO THE NAUTILUS WE CAN STILL MAKE IT
I LISTENED WITH ALL MY SENSES AT ONCE
LOOKED OUT OVER THE SEA AND SAID IN A VOICE OF WEEPING SAILORS THESE ARE NOT THE SHORES YOU PROMISED TO TAKE ME TO YONDER ISLAND IS NOT MY HOME WHAT HAVE I DONE THAT YOU SHOULD TREAT ME SO
FINALLY SCHOOLS OF PORPOISE THAT HELD CONTESTS OF SPEED WITH THE NAUTILUS BUT BY THIS POINT OBSERVING STUDYING AND CLASSIFYING WERE OUT OF THE QUESTION BY EVENING WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED LEAGUES UP THE ATLANTIC
RUSH OUT WITH IRRESISTIBLE VIOLENCE THEY FORM A VORTEX FROM WHICH NO SHIP HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE MONSTROUS WAVES RACE TOGETHER FROM EVERY POINT OF THE HORIZON
BUT WHILE THEY WERE GETTING READY THE INSTRUMENTS OF EXECUTION THE PRISON DOORS CAME OPEN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND THE CHAINS FELL FROM HIS LIMBS AND WHEN THEY LOOKED FOR HIM HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND PENTHEUS WOULD TAKE NO WARNING
HEAVING A SIGH SHE SAID I HOPE IT WILL TURN OUT SO BUT I CAN'T HELP BEING AFRAID PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY PRETEND TO BE IF HE IS INDEED JOVE MAKE HIM GIVE SOME PROOF OF IT
BLINDED BY THE GOD CRIED OUT SEE THERE THE WILD BOAR THE HUGEST MONSTER THAT PROWLS IN THESE WOODS COME ON SISTERS I WILL BE THE FIRST TO STRIKE THE WILD BOAR THE WHOLE BAND RUSHED UPON HIM AND WHILE HE NOW TALKS LESS ARROGANTLY
PERHAPS SPEAK TO ME ONE GESTURE FROM HIM COULD OBLITERATE ME A SINGLE WORD SHACKLE ME TO HIS VESSEL EVEN SO TEN O'CLOCK WAS ABOUT TO STRIKE IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE MY STATEROOM AND REJOIN MY COMPANIONS
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE BACCHUS ARIADNE BACCHUS BACCHUS WAS THE SON OF JUPITER AND SEMELE
THE SKIFF STILL ATTACHED TO THE SHIP'S PLATING WAS LIKEWISE CARRIED AROUND AT DIZZYING SPEED I COULD FEEL US WHIRLING I WAS EXPERIENCING THAT ACCOMPANYING NAUSEA
BUT NOW THE ATTENDANTS RETURNED WHOM HE HAD DESPATCHED TO SEIZE BACCHUS THEY HAD BEEN DRIVEN AWAY BY THE BACCHANALS BUT HAD SUCCEEDED IN TAKING ONE OF THEM PRISONER WHOM WITH HIS HANDS TIED BEHIND HIM
WE WERE RACING NORTH NORTHEAST WITH FRIGHTFUL SPEED FIFTY METERS DOWN I TOOK ONE LAST LOOK AT THE NATURAL WONDERS AND ARTISTIC TREASURES AMASSED IN THE MUSEUM THIS UNRIVALED COLLECTION DOOMED TO PERISH SOMEDAY IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEAS
AND WHAT A NOISE AROUND OUR FRAIL SKIFF WHAT ROARS ECHOING FROM SEVERAL MILES AWAY WHAT CRASHES FROM THE WATERS BREAKING AGAINST SHARP ROCKS ON THE SEAFLOOR WHERE THE HARDEST OBJECTS ARE SMASHED
SHADOWS GATHERED AND GLOOM OVERRAN THE SEA UNTIL THE MOON CAME UP I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM I COULDN'T SLEEP I WAS ASSAULTED BY NIGHTMARES THAT HORRIBLE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION KEPT REPEATING IN MY MIND'S EYE
NOT WALKING BUT GLIDING LIKE A GHOST HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING SWELLING WITH SOBS AND I HEARD HIM MURMUR THESE WORDS THE LAST OF HIS TO REACH MY EARS O ALMIGHTY GOD
THAT OUR HEADING WOULD TAKE US TO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS WITH INCOMPARABLE SPEED I COULD BARELY GLIMPSE THE SWIFT PASSING OF LONGNOSE SHARKS HAMMERHEAD SHARKS SPOTTED DOGFISH THAT FREQUENT THESE WATERS
EVERY PLEASANT OR UNPLEASANT INCIDENT THAT HAD CROSSED MY PATH SINCE I WENT OVERBOARD FROM THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN THE UNDERWATER HUNTING TRIP THE TORRES STRAIT OUR RUNNING AGROUND THE SAVAGES OF PAPUA
AND BETWEEN THEM HE WAS TORN TO PIECES WHILE HIS MOTHER SHOUTED VICTORY VICTORY WE HAVE DONE IT THE GLORY IS OURS SO THE WORSHIP OF BACCHUS WAS ESTABLISHED IN GREECE
HER MORTAL FRAME COULD NOT ENDURE THE SPLENDORS OF THE IMMORTAL RADIANCE SHE WAS CONSUMED TO ASHES JOVE TOOK THE INFANT BACCHUS AND GAVE HIM IN CHARGE
BUT ONE WORD TWENTY TIMES REPEATED ONE DREADFUL WORD TOLD ME THE REASON FOR THE AGITATION SPREADING ABOARD THE NAUTILUS WE WEREN'T THE CAUSE OF THE CREW'S CONCERN MAELSTROM MAELSTROM
WHERE TREE TRUNKS ARE WORN DOWN AND WORKED INTO A SHAGGY FUR AS NORWEGIANS EXPRESS IT WHAT A PREDICAMENT WE WERE ROCKING FRIGHTFULLY THE NAUTILUS DEFENDED ITSELF LIKE A HUMAN BEING
I OBEYED AND WHEN WE ARRIVED THERE I KINDLED THE ALTARS AND CELEBRATED THE SACRED RITES OF BACCHUS PENTHEUS HERE EXCLAIMED WE HAVE WASTED TIME ENOUGH ON THIS SILLY STORY TAKE HIM AWAY AND HAVE HIM EXECUTED WITHOUT DELAY
BACCHUS THAT FIRST FROM OUT THE PURPLE GRAPES CRUSHED THE SWEET POISON OF MISUSED WINE AFTER THE TUSCAN MANNERS TRANSFORMED COASTING THE TYRRHENE SHORE AS THE WINDS LISTED ON CIRCE'S ISLAND FELL
HE HADN'T FINISHED SPEAKING WHEN A CRACKING SOUND OCCURRED THE NUTS GAVE WAY AND RIPPED OUT OF ITS SOCKET THE SKIFF WAS HURLED LIKE A STONE FROM A SLING INTO THE MIDST OF THE VORTEX
SOMETIMES ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA SOMETIMES THIRTY FEET BENEATH IT AFTER OUR POSITION HAD BEEN MARKED ON THE CHART I SAW THAT WE WERE PASSING INTO THE MOUTH OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
WITH HIS EVERY MOVEMENT I IMAGINED HE WOULD APPEAR AND ASK ME WHY I WANTED TO ESCAPE I FELT IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF ALARM MY IMAGINATION MAGNIFIED THIS SENSATION THE FEELING BECAME SO ACUTE
FOUND HE HAD NO ARMS AND CURVING HIS MUTILATED BODY JUMPED INTO THE SEA WHAT HAD BEEN HIS LEGS BECAME THE TWO ENDS OF A CRESCENT SHAPED TAIL THE WHOLE CREW BECAME DOLPHINS AND SWAM ABOUT THE SHIP
I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE DREADING YET DESIRING AN ENCOUNTER WITH CAPTAIN NEMO WANTING YET NOT WANTING TO SEE HIM WHAT WOULD I SAY TO HIM HOW COULD I HIDE THE INVOLUNTARY HORROR HE INSPIRED IN ME NO
JUNO TO GRATIFY HER RESENTMENT AGAINST SEMELE CONTRIVED A PLAN FOR HER DESTRUCTION ASSUMING THE FORM OF BEROE HER AGED NURSE SHE INSINUATED DOUBTS WHETHER IT WAS INDEED JOVE HIMSELF WHO CAME AS A LOVER
WHERE WOULD THE MAN FLEE AFTER THIS HORRIBLE ACT OF REVENGE I REENTERED MY STATEROOM WHERE NED AND CONSEIL WERE WAITING SILENTLY
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS CAME BACK ON I WENT INTO THE LOUNGE IT WAS DESERTED I CONSULTED THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS THE NAUTILUS WAS FLEEING NORTHWARD AT A SPEED OF TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR
NOW UPON THE SURFACE NOW UNDER IT SCATTERING THE SPRAY AND SPOUTING THE WATER FROM THEIR BROAD NOSTRILS OF TWENTY MEN I ALONE WAS LEFT TREMBLING WITH FEAR THE GOD CHEERED ME FEAR NOT SAID HE STEER TOWARDS NAXOS
WE'LL ESCAPE TONIGHT EVEN IF THE SEA SWALLOWS US UP THE SEA'S ROUGH THE WIND'S BLOWING HARD BUT A TWENTY MILE RUN IN THE NAUTILUS'S NIMBLE LONGBOAT DOESN'T SCARE ME UNKNOWN TO THE CREW I'VE STOWED SOME FOOD AND FLASKS OF WATER INSIDE
MY COUNTRY IS MAEONIA MY PARENTS WERE POOR PEOPLE WHO HAD NO FIELDS OR FLOCKS TO LEAVE ME BUT THEY LEFT ME THEIR FISHING RODS AND NETS AND THEIR FISHERMAN'S TRADE THIS I FOLLOWED FOR SOME TIME TILL GROWING WEARY OF REMAINING IN ONE PLACE
WHO NOURISHED HIS INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD AND FOR THEIR CARE WERE REWARDED BY JUPITER BY BEING PLACED AS THE HYADES AMONG THE STARS WHEN BACCHUS GREW UP HE DISCOVERED THE CULTURE OF THE VINE AND THE MODE OF EXTRACTING ITS PRECIOUS JUICE
AFTER LIKEWISE CLOSING THE OPENING IN THE SKIFF THE CANADIAN BEGAN TO UNSCREW THE NUTS STILL BOLTING US TO THE UNDERWATER BOAT SUDDENLY A NOISE FROM THE SHIP'S INTERIOR BECAME AUDIBLE VOICES WERE ANSWERING EACH OTHER HURRIEDLY
THIS WAS WHERE THE NAUTILUS HAD BEEN SENT ACCIDENTALLY OR PERHAPS DELIBERATELY BY ITS CAPTAIN IT WAS SWEEPING AROUND IN A SPIRAL WHOSE RADIUS KEPT GROWING SMALLER AND SMALLER
WE HAVE SEEN IN THE STORY OF THESEUS HOW ARIADNE THE DAUGHTER OF KING MINOS AFTER HELPING THESEUS TO ESCAPE FROM THE LABYRINTH WAS CARRIED BY HIM TO THE ISLAND OF NAXOS
IT WAS BEST NOT TO MEET HIM FACE TO FACE BEST TO TRY AND FORGET HIM AND YET HOW LONG THAT DAY SEEMED THE LAST I WOULD SPEND ABOARD THE NAUTILUS I WAS LEFT TO MYSELF
AND THEY MIGHT GET A LIBERAL RANSOM FOR HIM I OBSERVED HIS DRESS HIS WALK HIS FACE THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THEM WHICH I FELT SURE WAS MORE THAN MORTAL I SAID TO MY MEN WHAT GOD THERE IS CONCEALED IN THAT FORM I KNOW NOT
HE PENETRATED THROUGH THE WOOD AND REACHED AN OPEN SPACE WHERE THE CHIEF SCENE OF THE ORGIES MET HIS EYES AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WOMEN SAW HIM
RIGHT AWAY THE CANADIAN REPLIED FIRST NED LAND CLOSED AND BOLTED THE OPENING CUT INTO THE NAUTILUS'S SHEET IRON USING THE MONKEY WRENCH HE HAD WITH HIM
AT SIX THIRTY NED LAND ENTERED MY STATEROOM HE TOLD ME WE WON'T SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN BEFORE WE GO AT TEN O'CLOCK THE MOON WON'T BE UP YET WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DARKNESS
THERE IS AN ALLUSION TO THE STORY OF BACCHUS AND THE MARINERS IN MILTON'S COMUS AT LINE FORTY SIX
THAT THE CENTAURS AND LAPITHAE QUARRELLED LOOK HOW THE CROWN WHICH ARIADNE WORE UPON HER IVORY FOREHEAD THAT SAME DAY THAT THESEUS HER UNTO HIS BRIDAL BORE
THE PRISONER UNTERRIFIED RESPONDED
HIS FEATURES WERE ACCENTUATED TAKING ON SUPERHUMAN PROPORTIONS HE WAS NO LONGER MY EQUAL HE WAS THE MAN OF THE WATERS THE SPIRIT OF THE SEAS BY THEN IT WAS NINE THIRTY
ASK HIM TO COME ARRAYED IN ALL HIS SPLENDORS SUCH AS HE WEARS IN HEAVEN THAT WILL PUT THE MATTER BEYOND A DOUBT SEMELE WAS PERSUADED TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT
IT WAS IN VAIN HIS NEAREST FRIENDS AND WISEST COUNSELLORS REMONSTRATED AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO OPPOSE THE GOD THEIR REMONSTRANCES ONLY MADE HIM MORE VIOLENT
THAT FOLLOWS SUCH CONTINUOUS SPINNING MOTIONS WE WERE IN DREAD IN THE LAST STAGES OF SHEER HORROR
BUT PERHAPS I'M MISTAKEN THAT THE NAUTILUS'S HAPHAZARD COURSE CONTINUED FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY DAYS AND I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG THIS WOULD HAVE GONE ON WITHOUT THE CATASTROPHE THAT ENDED OUR VOYAGE AS FOR CAPTAIN NEMO HE WAS NO LONGER IN THE PICTURE
AND AS HE SPOKE HIS MOUTH WIDENED HIS NOSTRILS EXPANDED AND SCALES COVERED ALL HIS BODY ANOTHER ENDEAVORING TO PULL THE OAR FELT HIS HANDS SHRINK UP AND PRESENTLY TO BE NO LONGER HANDS BUT FINS
I HELD MY HEAD IN BOTH HANDS TO KEEP IT FROM BURSTING I CLOSED MY EYES I NO LONGER WANTED TO THINK A HALF HOUR STILL TO WAIT A HALF HOUR OF NIGHTMARES THAT COULD DRIVE ME INSANE
THEY PROMISED SO TO DO AND TOLD ME TO PILOT THE SHIP TO NAXOS NAXOS LAY TO THE RIGHT AND I WAS TRIMMING THE SAILS TO CARRY US THERE WHEN SOME BY SIGNS AND OTHERS BY WHISPERS SIGNIFIED TO ME THEIR WILL
YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS OUR SITUATION HAD BECOME UNTENABLE ONE MORNING WHOSE DATE I'M UNABLE TO SPECIFY
THE CORAL CEMETERY THE SUEZ PASSAGEWAY THE ISLAND OF SANTORINI THE CRETAN DIVER THE BAY OF VIGO ATLANTIS THE ICE BANK THE SOUTH POLE
AND MELANTHUS MY STEERSMAN AND EPOPEUS THE LEADER OF THE SAILOR'S CRY ONE AND ALL EXCLAIMED SPARE YOUR PRAYERS FOR US SO BLIND IS THE LUST OF GAIN WHEN THEY PROCEEDED TO PUT HIM ON BOARD I RESISTED THEM
TOGETHER WITH ITS CURATOR I WANTED TO ESTABLISH ONE SUPREME IMPRESSION IN MY MIND I STAYED THERE AN HOUR BASKING IN THE AURA OF THE CEILING LIGHTS PASSING IN REVIEW THE TREASURES SHINING IN THEIR GLASS CASES
WHEN THEY SO TREACHEROUSLY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE PRIZE OF HIM AS ARIADNE SAT LAMENTING HER FATE BACCHUS FOUND HER CONSOLED HER AND MADE HER HIS WIFE AS A MARRIAGE PRESENT HE GAVE HER A GOLDEN CROWN ENRICHED WITH GEMS
WHOSE CHARMED CUP WHOEVER TASTED LOST HIS UPRIGHT SHAPE AND DOWNWARD FELL INTO A GROVELLING SWINE ARIADNE
THE GULF OF OB THE LYAKHOV ISLANDS OR THOSE UNKNOWN BEACHES ON THE SIBERIAN COAST I'M UNABLE TO SAY I LOST TRACK OF THE PASSING HOURS TIME WAS IN ABEYANCE ON THE SHIP'S CLOCKS
JUST THEN I HEARD INDISTINCT CHORDS FROM THE ORGAN MELANCHOLY HARMONIES FROM SOME UNDEFINABLE HYMN ACTUAL PLEADINGS FROM A SOUL TRYING TO SEVER ITS EARTHLY TIES
THE MEN ASTONISHED PULLED AT THEIR OARS AND SPREAD MORE SAIL TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS BY THE AID OF BOTH BUT ALL IN VAIN IVY TWINED ROUND THE OARS AND HINDERED THEIR MOTION AND CLUNG TO THE SAILS WITH HEAVY CLUSTERS OF BERRIES
I WENT OUT ON THE PLATFORM WHERE I COULD BARELY STAND UPRIGHT AGAINST THE JOLTS OF THE BILLOWS THE SKIES WERE THREATENING BUT LAND LAY INSIDE THOSE DENSE MISTS AND WE HAD TO ESCAPE NOT A SINGLE DAY OR EVEN A SINGLE HOUR COULD WE AFFORD TO LOSE
WHAT WAS IT HAD THEY SPOTTED OUR ESCAPE I FELT NED LAND SLIDING A DAGGER INTO MY HAND YES I MUTTERED WE KNOW HOW TO DIE THE CANADIAN PAUSED IN HIS WORK
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD WHO KNOWS WHERE THE NAUTILUS TOOK US IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC BASIN ALWAYS AT INCALCULABLE SPEED ALWAYS AMID THE HIGH ARCTIC MISTS
THEY WERE SHOUTING THE MAELSTROM COULD A MORE FRIGHTENING NAME HAVE RUNG IN OUR EARS UNDER MORE FRIGHTENING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE WE LYING IN THE DANGEROUS WATERWAYS OFF THE NORWEGIAN COAST
I CLIMBED THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY AND GOING ALONG THE UPPER GANGWAY I ARRIVED AT THE SKIFF I WENT THROUGH THE OPENING THAT HAD ALREADY GIVEN ACCESS TO MY TWO COMPANIONS LET'S GO LET'S GO I EXCLAIMED
COME TO THE SKIFF CONSEIL AND I WILL BE INSIDE WAITING FOR YOU THE CANADIAN LEFT WITHOUT GIVING ME TIME TO ANSWER HIM I WANTED TO VERIFY THE NAUTILUS'S HEADING I MADE MY WAY TO THE LOUNGE
WAS THE NAUTILUS BEING DRAGGED INTO THIS WHIRLPOOL JUST AS THE SKIFF WAS ABOUT TO DETACH FROM ITS PLATING AS YOU KNOW AT THE TURN OF THE TIDE THE WATERS CONFINED BETWEEN THE FAROE AND LOFOTEN ISLANDS
AS FOR HIS CHIEF OFFICER THE SAME APPLIED NOT ONE CREWMAN WAS VISIBLE FOR A SINGLE INSTANT THE NAUTILUS CRUISED BENEATH THE WATERS ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY WHEN IT ROSE BRIEFLY TO THE SURFACE TO RENEW OUR AIR
ALL THESE EVENTS PASSED BEFORE MY EYES LIKE BACKDROPS UNROLLING UPSTAGE IN A THEATER
I'M WITH YOU WHAT'S MORE THE CANADIAN ADDED IF THEY CATCH ME I'LL DEFEND MYSELF I'LL FIGHT TO THE DEATH THEN WE'LL DIE TOGETHER NED MY FRIEND MY MIND WAS MADE UP THE CANADIAN LEFT ME
WHEN I ASKED TONIGHT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY SUPERVISION LEFT ON THE NAUTILUS YOU'D THINK A TOTAL DAZE WAS REIGNING ON BOARD WILL YOU BE READY SIR YES WHERE ARE WE
THE GOD HIMSELF HAD A CHAPLET OF VINE LEAVES AND BORE IN HIS HAND A SPEAR WREATHED WITH IVY TIGERS CROUCHED AT HIS FEET AND FORMS OF LYNXES AND SPOTTED PANTHERS PLAYED AROUND HIM THE MEN WERE SEIZED WITH TERROR OR MADNESS
THE LOUNGE WAS PLUNGED IN PROFOUND DARKNESS CHORDS FROM THE ORGAN WERE REVERBERATING FAINTLY CAPTAIN NEMO WAS THERE HE DIDN'T SEE ME
THEY FORM A WHIRLPOOL APTLY CALLED THE OCEAN'S NAVEL WHOSE ATTRACTING POWER EXTENDS A DISTANCE OF FIFTEEN KILOMETERS IT CAN SUCK DOWN NOT ONLY SHIPS BUT WHALES AND EVEN POLAR BEARS FROM THE NORTHERNMOST REGIONS
SOME LEAPED OVERBOARD OTHERS PREPARING TO DO THE SAME BEHELD THEIR COMPANIONS IN THE WATER UNDERGOING A CHANGE THEIR BODIES BECOMING FLATTENED AND ENDING IN A CROOKED TAIL ONE EXCLAIMED WHAT MIRACLE IS THIS
BEARING CYMBALS FLUTES AND THYRSES WILD FROM NAXIAN GROVES OF ZANTE'S VINEYARDS SING DELIRIOUS VERSES IT WAS IN VAIN PENTHEUS REMONSTRATED COMMANDED AND THREATENED
THE HATCHES OPENED AND CLOSED AS IF AUTOMATED NO MORE POSITIONS WERE REPORTED ON THE WORLD MAP I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE I'LL ALSO MENTION THAT THE CANADIAN AT THE END OF HIS STRENGTH AND PATIENCE MADE NO FURTHER APPEARANCES
CONSEIL COULDN'T COAX A SINGLE WORD OUT OF HIM AND FEARED THAT IN A FIT OF DELIRIUM WHILE UNDER THE SWAY OF A GHASTLY HOMESICKNESS NED WOULD KILL HIMSELF SO HE KEPT A DEVOTED WATCH ON HIS FRIEND EVERY INSTANT
THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT TERRIFIED ME CAPTAIN NEMO HAD LEFT HIS STATEROOM HE WAS IN THE SAME LOUNGE I HAD TO CROSS IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THERE I WOULD ENCOUNTER HIM ONE LAST TIME HE WOULD SEE ME
WHO HAD NO RESPECT FOR THE NEW WORSHIP FORBADE ITS RITES TO BE PERFORMED BUT WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT BACCHUS WAS ADVANCING MEN AND WOMEN BUT CHIEFLY THE LATTER YOUNG AND OLD POURED FORTH TO MEET HIM AND TO JOIN HIS TRIUMPHAL MARCH
IT TOOK ME FIVE MINUTES TO REACH THE DOOR AT THE FAR END WHICH LED INTO THE LIBRARY
THIS SHIP SHALL NOT BE PROFANED BY SUCH IMPIETY SAID I I HAVE A GREATER SHARE IN HER THAN ANY OF YOU BUT LYCABAS A TURBULENT FELLOW SEIZED ME BY THE THROAT AND ATTEMPTED TO THROW ME OVERBOARD
AND I SCARCELY SAVED MYSELF BY CLINGING TO THE ROPES THE REST APPROVED THE DEED THEN BACCHUS FOR IT WAS INDEED HE AS IF SHAKING OFF HIS DROWSINESS EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH ME WHAT IS THIS FIGHTING ABOUT WHO BROUGHT ME HERE
THERE HE CLOTHED HIMSELF IN HIS SPLENDORS NOT PUTTING ON ALL HIS TERRORS AS WHEN HE OVERTHREW THE GIANTS BUT WHAT IS KNOWN AMONG THE GODS AS HIS LESSER PANOPLY ARRAYED IN THIS HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER OF SEMELE
I LEARNED THE PILOT'S ART AND HOW TO GUIDE MY COURSE BY THE STARS IT HAPPENED AS I WAS SAILING FOR DELOS WE TOUCHED AT THE ISLAND OF DIA AND WENT ASHORE NEXT MORNING I SENT THE MEN FOR FRESH WATER
THAT I SHOULD SAIL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND TAKE THE BOY TO EGYPT TO SELL HIM FOR A SLAVE I WAS CONFOUNDED AND SAID LET SOME ONE ELSE PILOT THE SHIP WITHDRAWING MYSELF FROM ANY FURTHER AGENCY IN THEIR WICKEDNESS THEY CURSED ME AND ONE OF THEM EXCLAIMING
FORTUNATELY I CONTROLLED MYSELF AND STRETCHED OUT ON THE BED TO SOOTHE MY BODILY AGITATION MY NERVES CALMED A LITTLE BUT WITH MY BRAIN SO AROUSED I DID A SWIFT REVIEW OF MY WHOLE EXISTENCE ABOARD THE NAUTILUS
I WAS SLUMBERING NEAR THE FIRST HOURS OF DAYLIGHT A PAINFUL SICKLY SLUMBER WAKING UP I SAW NED LAND LEANING OVER ME AND I HEARD HIM TELL ME IN A LOW VOICE WE'RE GOING TO ESCAPE I SAT UP
AND MYSELF MOUNTED THE HILL TO OBSERVE THE WIND WHEN MY MEN RETURNED BRINGING WITH THEM A PRIZE AS THEY THOUGHT A BOY OF DELICATE APPEARANCE WHOM THEY HAD FOUND ASLEEP THEY JUDGED HE WAS A NOBLE YOUTH PERHAPS A KING'S SON
THE ISLAND WHERE ARIADNE WAS LEFT WAS THE FAVORITE ISLAND OF BACCHUS THE SAME THAT HE WISHED
OUR IMPRISONMENT IN THE ICE THE BATTLE WITH THE DEVILFISH THE STORM IN THE GULF STREAM THE AVENGER AND THAT HORRIBLE SCENE OF THE VESSEL SINKING WITH ITS CREW
I EXPECTED ANY MOMENT TO SEE THAT SHROUDED HUMAN FIGURE VERY FAR LARGER IN ITS PROPORTIONS THAN ANY DWELLER AMONG MEN THROWN ACROSS THE CATARACT THAT PROTECTS THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE POLE I ESTIMATE
NOW EXCUSES HIMSELF AND NOW CONFESSES HIS CRIME AND IMPLORES PARDON THEY PRESS UPON HIM AND WOUND HIM IN VAIN HE CRIES TO HIS AUNTS TO PROTECT HIM FROM HIS MOTHER AUTONOE SEIZED ONE ARM INO THE OTHER
BETWEEN THE KNEELING HERCULES AND THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE SERPENT SPENSER ALLUDES TO ARIADNE'S CROWN THOUGH HE HAS MADE SOME MISTAKES IN HIS MYTHOLOGY IT WAS AT THE WEDDING OF PIRITHOUS AND NOT THESEUS
THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING PENTHEUS BEHOLDING HIM WITH WRATHFUL COUNTENANCE SAID FELLOW YOU SHALL SPEEDILY BE PUT TO DEATH THAT YOUR FATE MAY BE A WARNING TO OTHERS BUT THOUGH I GRUDGE THE DELAY OF YOUR PUNISHMENT SPEAK
AND WAS LEFT THERE ASLEEP WHILE THE UNGRATEFUL THESEUS PURSUED HIS WAY HOME WITHOUT HER ARIADNE ON WAKING AND FINDING HERSELF DESERTED ABANDONED HERSELF TO GRIEF BUT VENUS TOOK PITY ON HER AND CONSOLED HER WITH THE PROMISE
TEACHING THE PEOPLE THE CULTIVATION OF THE VINE THE MOST FAMOUS PART OF HIS WANDERINGS IS HIS EXPEDITION TO INDIA WHICH IS SAID TO HAVE LASTED SEVERAL YEARS RETURNING IN TRIUMPH HE UNDERTOOK TO INTRODUCE HIS WORSHIP INTO GREECE
WHATEVER HE HAD ONCE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF HUMANITY HE HAD NO RIGHT TO METE OUT SUCH PUNISHMENT HE HAD MADE ME IF NOT AN ACCOMPLICE AT LEAST AN EYEWITNESS TO HIS VENGEANCE EVEN THIS WAS INTOLERABLE
INSIDE THE NAUTILUS ALL WAS GLOOM AND SILENCE IT LEFT THIS PLACE OF DEVASTATION WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED ONE HUNDRED FEET BENEATH THE WATERS WHERE WAS IT GOING NORTH OR SOUTH
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO CARRY ME ONE OF THEM REPLIED FEAR NOTHING TELL US WHERE YOU WISH TO GO AND WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE NAXOS IS MY HOME SAID BACCHUS TAKE ME THERE AND YOU SHALL BE WELL REWARDED
LOOK DOWN INTO THE SMALL GRAVE AND WALK HOME ARM IN ARM THERE WAS GRIEF IN THE ARISTOCRATIC HOUSE AND THERE WAS JOY IN THE BOWER MISTER WEGG ARGUED IF AN ORPHAN WERE WANTED
UNTIL MISSUS BOFFIN ANNOUNCED IT
WHERE THE WHOLE METROPOLIS WAS A HEAP OF VAPOUR CHARGED WITH MUFFLED SOUND OF WHEELS AND ENFOLDING A GIGANTIC CATARRH AT NINE O'CLOCK ON SUCH A MORNING
IT SOUNDS TO ME SO WERE YOU ONE OF MANY CHILDREN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AN ONLY CHILD NO THERE WAS ANOTHER DEAD LONG AGO FATHER OR MOTHER ALIVE
AND A YAWNING GULF AT HIS WAISTBAND SLOPPY STOOD CONFESSED AND HOW IS BETTY MY GOOD FELLOW MISSUS BOFFIN ASKED HIM THANKEE MUM SAID SLOPPY
OH YOU ARE A DODGER THE OLD MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD GENTLY REPUDIATING THE IMPUTATION AND SUPPRESSED A SIGH AND MOVED TO THE TABLE AT WHICH MISTER FLEDGEBY WAS NOW POURING OUT FOR HIMSELF
WHICH MISTER ROKESMITH JUST NOW READ TO ME OUT ALOUD FOR I AIN'T GOOD AT HANDWRITINGS OFFERING TO FIND ME ANOTHER LITTLE CHILD TO NAME AND EDUCATE AND BRING UP WELL THIS HAS SET ME THINKING
TO ANOTHER DEAR CHILD AND IT PROVED AGAIN UNLUCKY NOW WHETHER SAID MISTER BOFFIN GRAVELY PROPOUNDING A CASE FOR HIS SECRETARY'S OPINION WHETHER ONE MIGHT CALL THAT A SUPERSTITION
WE AGREE NOT TO REVIVE JOHN HARMON'S NAME BUT TO LET IT REST IN THE GRAVE IT IS AS MISTER ROKESMITH SAYS A MATTER OF FEELING BUT LOR HOW MANY MATTERS ARE MATTERS OF FEELING
SHINING AND WINKING AND GLEAMING AND TWINKLING OUT OF A HUNDRED OF THOSE EYES OF BRIGHT METAL AT THE DAZZLED SPECTATORS THE ARTISTIC TASTE OF SOME UNKNOWN HATTER
CATCH A WEASEL AT IT AND CATCH A JEW
IT MAYN'T BE SO EASY TO START HER BUT ONCE STARTED SHE'S A INGEIN THIS HAS SET ME THINKING I SAY REPEATED MISSUS BOFFIN CORDIALLY BEAMING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER HUSBAND'S COMPLIMENT
OR EVEN IF I ANY WAYS SHOULD WANT A WINK OR TWO ADDED SLOPPY AFTER A MOMENT'S APOLOGETIC REFLECTION I COULD TAKE EM TURNING I'VE TOOK EM TURNING MANY A TIME AND ENJOYED EM WONDERFUL ON THE GRATEFUL IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT
SLOPPY YES MUM COME FORWARD SLOPPY SHOULD YOU LIKE TO DINE HERE EVERY DAY
AND MISTER FLEDGEBY'S RETREATING DRAPERY PLUNGED INTO BED AGAIN FOLLOWING IT AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE RIAH PASSED INTO THE BED CHAMBER WHERE A FIRE HAD BEEN SOMETIME LIGHTED AND WAS BURNING BRISKLY
RIAH WENT INTO THE FOG AND WAS LOST TO THE EYES OF SAINT MARY AXE BUT THE EYES OF THIS HISTORY CAN FOLLOW HIM WESTWARD BY CORNHILL CHEAPSIDE FLEET STREET AND THE STRAND TO PICCADILLY AND THE ALBANY
BUT THE REVEREND FRANK INCLINING TO THE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO DO ONE OR TWO OTHER THINGS SAY OUT OF NINE AND THIRTY CALCULATED TO TROUBLE THEIR CONSCIENCES RATHER MORE IF THEY WOULD THINK AS MUCH ABOUT THEM
WITH A BOTTOMLESS CHAIR A LANTERN AND A BUNCH OF MATCHES NOW OLD UN CRIED FASCINATION IN HIS LIGHT RAILLERY WHAT DODGERY ARE YOU UP TO NEXT SITTING THERE WITH YOUR EYES SHUT YOU AIN'T ASLEEP
SIR A LONG LIST REPLIED RIAH TAKING OUT A POCKET BOOK AND SELECTING FROM ITS CONTENTS A FOLDED PAPER WHICH BEING UNFOLDED BECAME A SHEET OF FOOLSCAP COVERED WITH CLOSE WRITING
AND DRAWING HER ARM THROUGH BELLA'S AND NODDY YOU SIT HERE AND MISTER ROKESMITH YOU SIT THERE NOW YOU SEE WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THIS MISTER AND MISSUS MILVEY HAVE SENT ME THE KINDEST NOTE POSSIBLE
THRICE HE REPEATED THESE ACTIONS BEFORE HIS LISTENING EARS WERE GREETED BY THE VOICE OF FLEDGEBY CALLING FROM HIS BED HOLD YOUR ROW I'LL COME AND OPEN THE DOOR DIRECTLY
HE HAD SOMETIMES BORNE A QUIETLY AMUSED FACE IN HER COMPANY BUT STILL IT HAD SEEMED AS IF THE PLEASURE HER GENIAL TEMPER AND RADIANT NATURE YIELDED HIM COULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AS NATURALLY EXPRESSED IN A TEAR AS IN A SMILE
RIAH PROCEEDED UP THE STAIRS AND PAUSED AT FASCINATION FLEDGEBY'S DOOR MAKING FREE WITH NEITHER BELL NOR KNOCKER HE STRUCK UPON THE DOOR WITH THE TOP OF HIS STAFF AND HAVING LISTENED SAT DOWN ON THE THRESHOLD
MIGHT I ASK MISS WILFER WHAT SHE THINKS IT HAS NOT BEEN A FORTUNATE NAME FOR ME SAID BELLA COLOURING
O MUM SLOPPY'S FEELINGS OBLIGED HIM TO SQUEEZE HIS HAT AND CONTRACT ONE LEG AT THE KNEE YES AND SHOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ALWAYS TAKEN CARE OF HERE IF YOU WERE INDUSTRIOUS AND DESERVING
WHEREFORE IF THE REVEREND FRANK HAD HAD TO READ THE WORDS THAT TROUBLED SOME OF HIS BRETHREN AND PROFITABLY TOUCHED INNUMERABLE HEARTS IN A WORSE CASE THAN JOHNNY'S HE WOULD HAVE DONE SO OUT OF THE PITY AND HUMILITY OF HIS SOUL
THE VOUCHERS WERE PRODUCED AND FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR MISTER FLEDGEBY CONCENTRATED HIS SUBLIME ATTENTION ON THEM THEY AND THE ACCOUNTS WERE ALL FOUND CORRECT AND THE BOOKS AND THE PAPERS RESUMED THEIR PLACES IN THE BAG
NO DON'T GO REJOINED MISSUS BOFFIN BECAUSE WE ARE COMING TO BUSINESS INSTEAD OF HAVING BEGUN IT AND YOU BELONG TO IT AS MUCH NOW MY DEAR BELLA AS I DO BUT I WANT MY NODDY TO CONSULT WITH US
BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS BRAGGING ABOUT SOMETHING GOT THE BOOKS THERE THEY ARE HERE SIR ALL RIGHT I'LL TURN THE GENERAL SUBJECT OVER IN MY MIND FOR A MINUTE OR TWO AND WHILE I'M ABOUT IT YOU CAN EMPTY YOUR BAG AND GET READY FOR ME
ARE YOU ANYWHERE HERE FLEDGEBY TO WHICH FLEDGEBY AFTER CAUTIONING RIAH IN A LOW VOICE TO TAKE HIS CUE AS IT SHOULD BE GIVEN HIM REPLIED HERE I AM AND OPENED HIS BEDROOM DOOR COME IN SAID FLEDGEBY
NOW SAID FLEDGEBY FORK OUT YOUR BALANCE IN HAND AND PROVE BY FIGURES HOW YOU MAKE IT OUT
OUT OF THOSE OLD CURIOUS RELATIONS OF HERS TOWARDS THE MURDERED MAN PERHAPS IN REVIVING THE NAME YOU WOULD NOT HAVE LIKED TO GIVE IT TO A LESS INTERESTING CHILD THAN THE ORIGINAL HE INTERESTED YOU VERY MUCH
BUT IN LIEU OF COMING DIRECTLY HE FELL INTO A SWEET SLEEP FOR SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR MORE DURING WHICH ADDED INTERVAL RIAH SAT UPON THE STAIRS AND WAITED WITH PERFECT PATIENCE AT LENGTH THE DOOR STOOD OPEN
IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN MARKED BY A SUBDUED AFFECTIONATE DEFERENCE THAT SEEMED TO HAVE SPRUNG UP ON THE VERY DAY OF HIS ENGAGEMENT WHATEVER WAS ODD IN HER DRESS OR HER WAYS HAD SEEMED TO HAVE NO ODDITY FOR HIM
PERPLEXED BY FINDING THAT SHE WAS NOT OBSERVED NOW DON'T MIND AN OLD LADY'S TALK SAID MISSUS BOFFIN BUT TELL ME ARE YOU QUITE SURE MISTER ROKESMITH THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HAD A DISAPPOINTMENT IN LOVE
WITH ANOTHER COMFORTABLE PLUNGE MISTER FLEDGEBY FELL ASLEEP AGAIN THE OLD MAN HAVING OBEYED HIS DIRECTIONS SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF A CHAIR AND FOLDING HIS HANDS BEFORE HIM GRADUALLY YIELDED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE WARMTH AND DOZED
AND FLEDGEBY CAST HIS SMALL EYES DOWN THE LIST THEY PRESENTLY BEGAN TO TWINKLE AND HE NO SOONER BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THEIR TWINKLING THAN HE LOOKED UP OVER HIS SHOULDER AT THE GRAVE FACE ABOVE HIM AND MOVED TO THE CHIMNEY PIECE
WHY WHAT TIME OF NIGHT DO YOU MEAN TO CALL IT INQUIRED FLEDGEBY TURNING AWAY BENEATH THE CLOTHES AND PRESENTING A COMFORTABLE RAMPART OF SHOULDER TO THE CHILLED FIGURE OF THE OLD MAN
BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT IN MY THOUGHTS AS WE HAD GIVEN THE NAME TO THE POOR CHILD AND AS THE POOR CHILD TOOK SO LOVINGLY TO ME I THINK I SHOULD FEEL JEALOUS OF CALLING ANOTHER CHILD BY IT
BOTHER JUSTICE SAID FLEDGEBY NOT IN GENEROSITY JEWS AND GENEROSITY SAID FLEDGEBY THAT'S A GOOD CONNEXION BRING OUT YOUR VOUCHERS AND DON'T TALK JERUSALEM PALAVER
AND FAR BE IT FROM ME TO TELL YOU OTHERWISE IT SHALL BE SEEN TO IF BETTY HIGDEN CAN BE TURNED FOR ALL THE SAME YOU SHALL COME HERE AND BE TAKEN CARE OF FOR LIFE AND BE MADE ABLE TO KEEP HER IN OTHER WAYS THAN THE TURNING
HAD FURNISHED HIM WITH A HATBAND OF WHOLESALE CAPACITY WHICH WAS FLUTED BEHIND FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HAT TO THE BRIM AND TERMINATED IN A BLACK BUNCH FROM WHICH THE IMAGINATION SHRUNK DISCOMFITED AND THE REASON REVOLTED
HELD HIS PEACE INDEED THE REVEREND FRANK MILVEY WAS A FORBEARING MAN WHO NOTICED MANY SAD WARPS AND BLIGHTS IN THE VINEYARD WHEREIN HE WORKED AND DID NOT PROFESS THAT THEY MADE HIM SAVAGELY WISE
THAT I AM TRYING TO MAKE TERMS FOR AN UNFORTUNATE FRIEND WITH IN A MATTER OF SOME DISHONOURED BILLS
ANIMATE LONDON WITH SMARTING EYES AND IRRITATED LUNGS WAS BLINKING WHEEZING AND CHOKING INANIMATE LONDON WAS A SOOTY SPECTRE DIVIDED IN PURPOSE BETWEEN BEING VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE
IT WAS CREDITABLE TO HIS TENDERNESS OF HEART BUT SUGGESTED THAT HE MIGHT ON OCCASION GIVE SOME OFFENCE TO THE NEIGHBOURS
CHAPTER TEN A SUCCESSOR SOME OF THE REVEREND FRANK MILVEY'S BRETHREN HAD FOUND THEMSELVES EXCEEDINGLY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THEIR MINDS BECAUSE THEY WERE REQUIRED TO BURY THE DEAD TOO HOPEFULLY
AND SO BEING WHOLLY NEITHER GASLIGHTS FLARED IN THE SHOPS WITH A HAGGARD AND UNBLEST AIR AS KNOWING THEMSELVES TO BE NIGHT CREATURES THAT HAD NO BUSINESS ABROAD UNDER THE SUN WHILE THE SUN ITSELF
SOME SPECIAL POWERS WITH WHICH HIS LEGS WERE ENDOWED HAD ALREADY HITCHED UP HIS GLOSSY TROUSERS AT THE ANKLES AND BAGGED THEM AT THE KNEES
WHEW WHISTLED FLEDGEBY AS HE TOOK IT IN HIS HAND QUEER STREET IS FULL OF LODGERS JUST AT PRESENT THESE ARE TO BE DISPOSED OF IN PARCELS ARE THEY IN PARCELS AS SET FORTH RETURNED THE OLD MAN LOOKING OVER HIS MASTER'S SHOULDER
AT THE MERE THOUGHT OF MISSUS HIGDEN IN THIS INCONCEIVABLE AFFLICTION MISTER SLOPPY'S COUNTENANCE BECAME PALE AND MANIFESTED THE MOST DISTRESSFUL EMOTIONS YOU ARE AS RIGHT AS RIGHT CAN BE SLOPPY SAID MISSUS BOFFIN
HERE THE FOOTMAN WHOSE FEELINGS HAD BEEN HURT ON THE FORMER OCCASION APPEARED AND CROSSING TO ROKESMITH APOLOGETICALLY ANNOUNCED THE OBJECTIONABLE SLOPPY THE FOUR MEMBERS OF COUNCIL LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND PAUSED
SHALL HE BE BROUGHT HERE MA'AM ASKED ROKESMITH YES SAID MISSUS BOFFIN WHEREUPON THE FOOTMAN DISAPPEARED REAPPEARED PRESENTING SLOPPY AND RETIRED MUCH DISGUSTED
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DISCERNED THAT THE LOFTIEST BUILDINGS MADE AN OCCASIONAL STRUGGLE TO GET THEIR HEADS ABOVE THE FOGGY SEA AND ESPECIALLY THAT THE GREAT DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S SEEMED TO DIE HARD BUT THIS WAS NOT PERCEIVABLE IN THE STREETS AT THEIR FEET
IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS HABITUAL SUBMISSION THAT HE SAT DOWN ON THE RAW DARK STAIRCASE AS MANY OF HIS ANCESTORS HAD PROBABLY SAT DOWN IN DUNGEONS TAKING WHAT BEFELL HIM AS IT MIGHT BEFALL
BUT A CREATURE TO BE HELPED FOR ITS OWN SAKE NOT PRETTY THEN SAID BELLA NO RETURNED MISSUS BOFFIN STOUTLY NOR PREPOSSESSING THEN SAID BELLA
I FURTHER NAMED TO MY HUSBAND THAT IT WAS COMFORTING TO THINK THAT HOW THE POOR BOY WOULD BE BENEFITED BY JOHN'S OWN MONEY AND PROTECTED FROM JOHN'S OWN FORLORNNESS HEAR HEAR CRIED MISTER BOFFIN SO SHE DID
ROKESMITH DEPARTED ON THAT ERRAND AND PRESENTLY RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY MISTER BOFFIN AT HIS JOG TROT BELLA FELT A LITTLE VAGUE TREPIDATION AS TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS SAME CONSULTATION
AFTER A TIME WHEN HE HAD GROWN SO COLD AS TO BE FAIN TO BLOW UPON HIS FINGERS HE AROSE AND KNOCKED WITH HIS STAFF AGAIN AND LISTENED AGAIN AND AGAIN SAT DOWN TO WAIT
BOOK THE THIRD A LONG LANE CHAPTER ONE LODGERS IN QUEER STREET IT WAS A FOGGY DAY IN LONDON AND THE FOG WAS HEAVY AND DARK
NONE CAN EVER BE BETTER FRIENDS TO ME THAN MISSUS HIGDEN'S BEEN AND SHE MUST BE TURNED FOR MUST MISSUS HIGDEN WHERE WOULD MISSUS HIGDEN BE IF SHE WARN'T TURNED FOR
DEAD AND THE REST OF YOUR RELATIONS
I HOPE EVERYBODY DOES THEY OUGHT SAID MISSUS BOFFIN BUT WE DON'T ALL OF US DO WHAT WE OUGHT DO US JOHN ROKESMITH REPLIED SOME AMONG US SUPPLY THE SHORT COMINGS OF THE REST
WELL MY DEAR RETURNED MISSUS BOFFIN GIVING HER A SQUEEZE IT'S KIND OF YOU TO FIND THAT REASON OUT AND I HOPE IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO AND INDEED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT I BELIEVE IT WAS SO BUT I AM AFRAID NOT TO THE WHOLE EXTENT
ON THE GENUINE LEG REMAINING TO HIM JOHN ROKESMITH'S MANNER TOWARDS MISSUS BOFFIN AT THIS TIME WAS MORE THE MANNER OF A YOUNG MAN TOWARDS A MOTHER THAN THAT OF A SECRETARY TOWARDS HIS EMPLOYER'S WIFE
NOT YOU RETURNED FLEDGEBY WITH A CUNNING LOOK A TELLING MOVE WITH A GOOD MANY I DARE SAY BUT IT WON'T PUT ME OFF MY GUARD NOT A BAD NOTION THOUGH IF YOU WANT TO LOOK INDIFFERENT IN DRIVING A BARGAIN
I SAY AGAIN IT IS A MATTER OF FEELING RETURNED THE SECRETARY
AND WIPING THE MOISTURE FROM HIS BEARD AND LONG GREY HAIR AS HE STOOD ON THE VERGE OF THE RUG WITH HIS EYES ON THE ACCEPTABLE FIRE WITH A PLUNGE OF ENJOYMENT FLEDGEBY SETTLED HIMSELF AFRESH
AND A LITTLE WITHIN IT BROWN AND THEN BROWNER AND THEN BROWNER UNTIL AT THE HEART OF THE CITY WHICH CALL SAINT MARY AXE IT WAS RUSTY BLACK FROM ANY POINT OF THE HIGH RIDGE OF LAND NORTHWARD
HE TOOK NONE THAT COULD BE DETECTED BUT AWARE OF HIS EMPLOYER'S SUSPICIONS STOOD WITH HIS EYES ON THE GROUND MISTER FLEDGEBY WAS THUS AMIABLY ENGAGED WHEN A STEP WAS HEARD AT THE OUTER DOOR
SUPPOSED IT TO BE SOME ORDINARY FIGURE INDISTINCTLY SEEN WHICH FANCY AND THE FOG HAD WORKED INTO THAT PASSING LIKENESS ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE IN WHICH HIS MASTER'S CHAMBERS WERE ON THE SECOND FLOOR
HE TREATED IT WITH A MANLY TENDERNESS AND RESPECT FOR WHICH SHE COULD HARDLY THANK HIM ENOUGH BUT I DO THANK YOU MISTER ROKESMITH SAID MISSUS BOFFIN AND I THANK YOU MOST KINDLY YOU LOVE CHILDREN
HE ONLY LEARNED THAT THE MORE HE HIMSELF KNEW IN HIS LITTLE LIMITED HUMAN WAY THE BETTER HE COULD DISTANTLY IMAGINE WHAT OMNISCIENCE MIGHT KNOW
EVEN AS TO THAT MUM ANSWERED THE ECSTATIC SLOPPY THE TURNING MIGHT BE DONE IN THE NIGHT DON'T YOU SEE I COULD BE HERE IN THE DAY AND TURN IN THE NIGHT I DON'T WANT NO SLEEP I DON'T
QUITE SURE WHY DO YOU ASK ME WHY FOR THIS REASON SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A KIND OF KEPT DOWN MANNER WITH YOU WHICH IS NOT LIKE YOUR AGE YOU CAN'T BE THIRTY I AM NOT YET THIRTY
MEAT ONE BEER TWO VEGETABLES THREE AND WHICH WAS FOUR WHY PUDDING HE WAS FOUR HERE SLOPPY THREW HIS HEAD BACK OPENED HIS MOUTH WIDE AND LAUGHED RAPTUROUSLY
HOWEVER THAT DON'T COME IN QUESTION NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE WITH THE NAME LAID IT UP AS A REMEMBRANCE SUGGESTED BELLA MUSINGLY MUCH BETTER SAID MY DEAR LAID IT UP AS A REMEMBRANCE WELL THEN I HAVE BEEN THINKING
THE COMPLETENESS OF HIS SYMPATHY WITH HER FANCY FOR HAVING A LITTLE JOHN HARMON TO PROTECT AND REAR HE HAD SHOWN IN EVERY ACT AND WORD AND NOW THAT THE KIND FANCY WAS DISAPPOINTED
THITHER HE WENT AT HIS GRAVE AND MEASURED PACE STAFF IN HAND SKIRT AT HEEL AND MORE THAN ONE HEAD TURNING TO LOOK BACK AT HIS VENERABLE FIGURE ALREADY LOST IN THE MIST
YOU HAVE LOVED CHILDREN WELL MISTER BOFFIN HAS TOLD ME NOT A BIT BETTER THAN HE HAS BUT THAT'S HIS WAY HE PUTS ALL THE GOOD UPON ME YOU SPEAK RATHER SADLY MISTER ROKESMITH DO I
OR THE LUMP HALF THE LUMP WILL BE WASTE PAPER ONE KNOWS BEFOREHAND SAID FLEDGEBY CAN YOU GET IT AT WASTE PAPER PRICE THAT'S THE QUESTION RIAH SHOOK HIS HEAD
HE WAS ROUSED BY MISTER FLEDGEBY'S APPEARING ERECT AT THE FOOT OF THE BED IN TURKISH SLIPPERS ROSE COLOURED TURKISH TROUSERS GOT CHEAP FROM SOMEBODY WHO HAD CHEATED SOME OTHER SOMEBODY OUT OF THEM AND A GOWN AND CAP TO CORRESPOND
ANCOAR NO NOT ANCOAR NODDY MY DEAR RETURNED MISSUS BOFFIN BECAUSE I AM GOING TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE I MEANT THAT I AM SURE AS MUCH AS I STILL MEAN IT
DEEMING IT HIGH TIME TO MAKE HER PRESENCE KNOWN BELLA COUGHED HERE TO ATTRACT ATTENTION BEGGED PARDON AND SAID SHE WOULD GO FEARING THAT SHE INTERRUPTED SOME MATTER OF BUSINESS
AND WERE COLLAPSING FLAT AND COLD EVEN IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY IT WAS A FOGGY DAY BUT THERE THE FOG WAS GREY WHEREAS IN LONDON IT WAS AT ABOUT THE BOUNDARY LINE DARK YELLOW
BUT THIS LITTLE DEATH HAS MADE ME ASK MYSELF THE QUESTION SERIOUSLY WHETHER I WASN'T TOO BENT UPON PLEASING MYSELF ELSE WHY DID I SEEK OUT SO MUCH FOR A PRETTY CHILD AND A CHILD QUITE TO MY LIKING
HOW ARE THE TWO POOR LITTLE MINDERS ASKED MISSUS BOFFIN STRIKING RIGHT OUT MUM AND COMING ROUND BEAUTIFUL
AND I HAVE THOUGHT TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL THAT I HAVE GROWN TIMID OF REVIVING JOHN HARMON'S NAME IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE NAME AND I FANCY I SHOULD REPROACH MYSELF IF I GAVE IT
I SUPPOSE HE SAID TAKING ONE UP TO EYE IT CLOSELY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN LIGHTENING ANY OF THESE BUT IT'S A TRADE OF YOUR PEOPLE'S YOU KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT SWEATING A POUND MEANS DON'T YOU
I THINK I SHOULD FEEL AS IF THE NAME HAD BECOME ENDEARED TO ME AND I HAD NO RIGHT TO USE IT SO AND THAT'S YOUR OPINION REMARKED MISTER BOFFIN OBSERVANT OF THE SECRETARY'S FACE AND AGAIN ADDRESSING HIM
OH MUM BUT THERE'S MISSUS HIGDEN SAID SLOPPY CHECKING HIMSELF IN HIS RAPTURES DRAWING BACK AND SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH VERY SERIOUS MEANING THERE'S MISSUS HIGDEN MISSUS HIGDEN GOES BEFORE ALL
MISTER SLOPPY KISSED MISSUS BOFFIN'S HAND AND THEN DETACHING HIMSELF FROM THAT GOOD CREATURE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE ROOM ENOUGH FOR HIS FEELINGS THREW BACK HIS HEAD OPENED HIS MOUTH WIDE AND UTTERED A DISMAL HOWL
BUT IS HONEST AND INDUSTRIOUS AND REQUIRES A HELPING HAND AND DESERVES IT IF I AM VERY MUCH IN EARNEST AND QUITE DETERMINED TO BE UNSELFISH LET ME TAKE CARE OF HIM
RIAH OBEYED AND THEN TAKING A BAG FROM HIS BREAST AND REFERRING TO THE SUM IN THE ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH THEY MADE HIM RESPONSIBLE TOLD IT OUT UPON THE TABLE FLEDGEBY TOLD IT AGAIN WITH GREAT CARE AND RANG EVERY SOVEREIGN
NO RETURNED MISSUS BOFFIN NOT NECESSARILY SO THAT'S AS IT MAY HAPPEN A WELL DISPOSED BOY COMES IN MY WAY WHO MAY BE EVEN A LITTLE WANTING IN SUCH ADVANTAGES FOR GETTING ON IN LIFE
WELL AND SO I COME TO THE SECOND THING I HAVE THOUGHT OF YOU MUST KNOW BELLA MY DEAR AND MISTER ROKESMITH THAT WHEN I FIRST NAMED TO MY HUSBAND MY THOUGHTS OF ADOPTING A LITTLE ORPHAN BOY IN REMEMBRANCE OF JOHN HARMON
NEXT SAID FLEDGEBY CONCERNING THAT BILL BROKING BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS THE BRANCH I LIKE BEST WHAT QUEER BILLS ARE TO BE BOUGHT AND AT WHAT PRICES YOU HAVE GOT YOUR LIST OF WHAT'S IN THE MARKET
MAKING A DESK OF IT HE STOOD THERE WITH HIS BACK TO THE OLD MAN WARMING HIS KNEES PERUSING THE LIST AT HIS LEISURE AND OFTEN RETURNING TO SOME LINES OF IT AS THOUGH THEY WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING
THE DEUCE IT IS THEN IT MUST BE PRECIOUS FOGGY VERY FOGGY SIR AND RAW THEN CHILL AND BITTER SAID RIAH DRAWING OUT A HANDKERCHIEF
WANTING TO DO GOOD WHY NOT DO IT FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND PUT MY TASTES AND LIKINGS BY PERHAPS SAID BELLA AND PERHAPS SHE SAID IT WITH SOME LITTLE SENSITIVENESS ARISING
HARK THAT'S YOUR DOING YOU PUMP OF ISRAEL SAID FLEDGEBY YOU CAN'T HAVE SHUT IT
ON WHICH THE TAILOR HAD RECEIVED PERSONAL DIRECTIONS FROM ROKESMITH TO EXPEND THE UTMOST CUNNING OF HIS ART WITH A VIEW TO THE CONCEALMENT OF THE COHERING AND SUSTAINING BUTTONS
ANY SNOW OR SLEET OR SLUSH OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT HE ASKED NO SIR NO NOT QUITE SO BAD AS THAT THE STREETS ARE PRETTY CLEAN YOU NEEDN'T BRAG ABOUT IT RETURNED FLEDGEBY
MUCH AS YOU DO SIR RETURNED THE OLD MAN WITH HIS HANDS UNDER OPPOSITE CUFFS OF HIS LOOSE SLEEVES AS HE STOOD AT THE TABLE DEFERENTIALLY OBSERVANT OF THE MASTER'S FACE MAY I TAKE THE LIBERTY TO SAY SOMETHING
WHEN IT WAS FOR A FEW MOMENTS DIMLY INDICATED THROUGH CIRCLING EDDIES OF FOG
WAS HE NOT AN ORPHAN HIMSELF AND COULD A BETTER BE DESIRED AND WHY GO BEATING ABOUT BRENTFORD BUSHES SEEKING ORPHANS FORSOOTH WHO HAD ESTABLISHED NO CLAIMS UPON YOU AND MADE NO SACRIFICES FOR YOU
AND PRETTY NOW GIVE US YOUR OPINION NODDY SAID MISSUS BOFFIN MY OPINION OLD LADY RETURNED THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN IS YOUR OPINION THEN SAID MISSUS BOFFIN
WHEN HERE WAS AN ORPHAN READY TO YOUR HAND WHO HAD GIVEN UP IN YOUR CAUSE MISS ELIZABETH MASTER GEORGE AUNT JANE AND UNCLE PARKER MISTER WEGG CHUCKLED CONSEQUENTLY WHEN HE HEARD THE TIDINGS
IT IS A MATTER OF FEELING WITH MISSUS BOFFIN SAID ROKESMITH GENTLY THE NAME HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNFORTUNATE IT HAS NOW THIS NEW UNFORTUNATE ASSOCIATION CONNECTED WITH IT THE NAME HAS DIED OUT WHY REVIVE IT
WHILE SIMILAR GIFTS IN HIS ARMS HAD RAISED HIS COAT SLEEVES FROM HIS WRISTS AND ACCUMULATED THEM AT HIS ELBOWS THUS SET FORTH
WITH THE CHARACTER WHICH IT IS YOUR POLICY THAT I SHOULD BEAR I DON'T FIND IT WORTH MY WHILE TO CUT THINGS SO FINE AS TO GO INTO THE INQUIRY FASCINATION COOLLY ANSWERED NOT IN JUSTICE
READING THEM OVER JOHNNY HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN SIX CHILDREN BUT NOT OF HIS POVERTY AND READ THEM WITH DIMMED EYES AND VERY SERIOUSLY DID HE AND HIS BRIGHT LITTLE WIFE WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING
I NEVER HEARD OF ANY AT THIS POINT OF THE DIALOGUE BELLA CAME IN WITH A LIGHT STEP SHE PAUSED AT THE DOOR A MOMENT HESITATING WHETHER TO REMAIN OR RETIRE
