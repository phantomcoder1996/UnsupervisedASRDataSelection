THE VENUE IS DIFFERENT CHELSEA AND BLOOMSBURY HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF HAMPSTEAD NOTTING HILL GATE AND HIGH STREET KENSINGTON
THE WAR CRY SOUNDS HOLLOW IN THEIR MOUTH THEY ARE LIKE POOR WANTONS ATTEMPTING WITH PENCIL PAINT AND POWDER WITH SHRILL GAIETY TO RECOVER THE ILLUSION OF THEIR SPRING
WAS A BOY OF SIXTEEN AT RUGBY
WHICH HAS REMAINED MOST OBSCURE IF THEY WHO BELIEVE IN STRICKLAND'S GREATNESS ARE RIGHT THE PERSONAL NARRATIVES OF SUCH AS KNEW HIM IN THE FLESH
DID YOU THINK THE FOOD WAS GOOD I TOLD HER THAT IF SHE WANTED WRITERS SHE MUST FEED THEM WELL ADMIRABLE ADVICE I ANSWERED BUT WHY DOES SHE WANT THEM MISS WATERFORD SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS SHE FINDS THEM AMUSING
IT IS NOT WITHOUT MELANCHOLY THAT I WANDER AMONG MY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE WORLD OF LETTERS IN LONDON WHEN FIRST BASHFUL BUT EAGER I WAS INTRODUCED TO IT IT IS LONG SINCE I FREQUENTED IT AND
THE DINING ROOM WAS IN THE GOOD TASTE OF THE PERIOD IT WAS VERY SEVERE
THE SPADE WAS NOT INVARIABLY CALLED A BLOODY SHOVEL WOMAN HAD NOT YET ALTOGETHER COME INTO HER OWN
WHEN I ARRIVED A LITTLE LATE BECAUSE IN MY FEAR OF BEING TOO EARLY I HAD WALKED THREE TIMES ROUND THE CATHEDRAL I FOUND THE PARTY ALREADY COMPLETE MISS WATERFORD WAS THERE AND MISSUS JAY RICHARD TWINING AND GEORGE ROAD WE WERE ALL WRITERS
AND THEIR DREAMS A TRIFLE DULL I DO NOT LIKE THEM I AM ON THE SHELF I WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE MORAL STORIES IN RHYMED COUPLETS BUT
NEVER PREVENTED AN EDITOR FROM TAKING YOUR STUFF
FROM AN ERA IN WHICH HE HAD HIS PLACE INTO ONE WHICH IS STRANGE TO HIM AND THEN THE CURIOUS ARE OFFERED ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR SPECTACLES IN THE HUMAN COMEDY WHO NOW FOR EXAMPLE THINKS OF GEORGE CRABBE
AND THE EFFECT WAS UNGAINLY HE WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND HIS LARGE FACE LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLY NAKED HIS HAIR WAS REDDISH CUT VERY SHORT AND HIS EYES WERE SMALL BLUE OR GREY HE LOOKED COMMONPLACE
IT MUST HAVE BEEN BAD FOR THE FURNITURE BUT I SUPPOSE THE HOSTESS TOOK HER REVENGE ON THE FURNITURE OF HER FRIENDS WHEN IN TURN SHE VISITED THEM SOME OF THEM WERE DRESSED FASHIONABLY
FAILURE OR SUCCESS NOW THE WAR HAS COME
WHO FOR THE MOST PART ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THE AUTHOR THAN IN HIS BOOK IN THE PAINTER THAN IN HIS PICTURES AND SHE INVENTED A WORLD OF THE IMAGINATION IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH A FREEDOM SHE NEVER ACQUIRED IN THE WORLD OF EVERY DAY
SHE WANTS TO BE IN THE MOVEMENT I FANCY SHE'S RATHER SIMPLE POOR DEAR AND SHE THINKS WE'RE ALL WONDERFUL AFTER ALL IT PLEASES HER TO ASK US TO LUNCHEON AND IT DOESN'T HURT US I LIKE HER FOR IT
WE BEGAN TO CHAT ABOUT VINTAGES AND TOBACCO THE K C TOLD US OF A CASE HE WAS ENGAGED IN AND THE COLONEL TALKED ABOUT POLO I HAD NOTHING TO SAY AND SO SAT SILENT TRYING POLITELY TO SHOW INTEREST IN THE CONVERSATION
BECAUSE WE LIVED IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD WE FELT FRIENDLY DISPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER THE ARMY AND NAVY STORES ARE A BOND OF UNION BETWEEN ALL WHO DWELL BETWEEN THE RIVER AND SAINT JAMES'S PARK
BUT I DO NOT REMEMBER SO CRUDE A PROMISCUITY AS SEEMS TO BE PRACTISED IN THE PRESENT DAY WE DID NOT THINK IT HYPOCRITICAL TO DRAW OVER OUR VAGARIES THE CURTAIN OF A DECENT SILENCE
BUT HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INFLUENCE ON HER CONVICTIONS IS THERE A MISTER STRICKLAND I ASKED OH YES HE'S SOMETHING IN THE CITY I BELIEVE HE'S A STOCKBROKER HE'S VERY DULL ARE THEY GOOD FRIENDS
OR TO ANOTHER WHO PUSHED A BOOK FOR ALL IT WAS WORTH SOME ADVERTISED BADLY AND SOME WELL SOME WERE MODERN AND SOME WERE OLD FASHIONED THEN WE WOULD TALK OF AGENTS AND THE OFFERS THEY HAD OBTAINED FOR US
THERE AS IS NOTORIOUS HE SPENT THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE AND THERE I CAME ACROSS PERSONS WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH HIM I FIND MYSELF IN A POSITION TO THROW LIGHT ON JUST THAT PART OF HIS TRAGIC CAREER
SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE ASPERSIONS OF HER FRIENDS HE'S ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE AND HE'S A TYPICAL BROKER I THINK HE'D BORE YOU TO DEATH DOES HE BORE YOU I ASKED YOU SEE I HAPPEN TO BE HIS WIFE
THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE THEY MET WITH INDIFFERENCE AND WOULD PART WITH RELIEF IT WAS OF COURSE A PURELY SOCIAL FUNCTION THE STRICKLANDS OWED DINNERS TO A NUMBER OF PERSONS WHOM THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN AND SO HAD ASKED THEM
STRICKLAND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND MOVING TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE TOOK HIS PLACE BETWEEN THE K C AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL HE PASSED ROUND THE PORT AGAIN AND HANDED US CIGARS THE K C REMARKED ON THE EXCELLENCE OF THE WINE AND STRICKLAND TOLD US WHERE HE GOT IT
THE PENDULUM SWINGS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THE CIRCLE IS EVER TRAVELLED ANEW SOMETIMES A MAN SURVIVES A CONSIDERABLE TIME
THE MEN WERE SELDOM ECCENTRIC IN APPEARANCE THEY TRIED TO LOOK AS LITTLE LIKE AUTHORS AS POSSIBLE
I WAS VERY YOUNG AND PERHAPS SHE LIKED THE IDEA OF GUIDING MY VIRGIN STEPS ON THE HARD ROAD OF LETTERS WHILE FOR ME IT WAS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMEONE I COULD GO TO WITH MY SMALL TROUBLES CERTAIN OF AN ATTENTIVE EAR AND REASONABLE COUNSEL
I SHOULD BE THRICE A FOOL IF I DID IT FOR AUGHT BUT MY OWN ENTERTAINMENT
THEY TALKED OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND OF GOLF OF THEIR CHILDREN AND THE LATEST PLAY OF THE PICTURES AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF THE WEATHER AND THEIR PLANS FOR THE HOLIDAYS
WITH A SICK BED RID MOTHER REVEALED BUT GOD'S WARM SUN STREAMED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW LOVELY ROSES NODDED FROM THE WOODEN FLOWER BOXES ON THE ROOF
YET WE MAY BOLDLY ASSERT THAT THE SOUL IS SHREWDEST WHEN IT SHAKES OFF EVERY FETTER AND EVERY SORT OF LEADING STRING THE BODY ONLY MAKES IT STUPID THE SEEMINGLY DEAD BODY OF THE WATCHMAN WANDERED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE HOSPITAL
THE COUNCILLOR IMAGINED IT WAS THE CHOLERA THAT WAS MEANT WHICH PEOPLE MADE SO MUCH FUSS ABOUT AND THE DISCOURSE PASSED OFF SATISFACTORILY ENOUGH
SO HE PUT THEM ON QUICKLY STUCK HIS PAPERS IN HIS POCKET AND TOOK BESIDES A FEW UNDER HIS ARM INTENDING TO LOOK THEM THROUGH AT HOME TO MAKE THE NECESSARY NOTES IT WAS NOON AND THE WEATHER THAT HAD THREATENED RAIN BEGAN TO CLEAR UP WHILE GAILY DRESSED HOLIDAY FOLKS FILLED THE STREETS
SOME ONE OF THE WORTHY BURGHERS NOW SPOKE OF THE DREADFUL PESTILENCE THAT HAD RAGED IN THE COUNTRY A FEW YEARS BACK
ALL SEEMED TO HIM IN PROPER ORDER AS USUAL IT WAS EAST STREET SPLENDID AND ELEGANT AS WE NOW SEE IT HE LAY WITH HIS FEET TOWARDS A DOORWAY AND EXACTLY OPPOSITE SAT THE WATCHMAN ASLEEP GRACIOUS HEAVEN SAID HE HAVE I LAIN HERE IN THE STREET AND DREAMED
THE YOUNGER IT IS TRUE WAS NOT DAME FORTUNE HERSELF BUT ONE OF THE WAITING MAIDS OF HER HANDMAIDENS WHO CARRY ABOUT THE LESSER GOOD THINGS THAT SHE DISTRIBUTES THE OTHER LOOKED EXTREMELY GLOOMY IT WAS CARE SHE ALWAYS ATTENDS TO HER OWN SERIOUS BUSINESS HERSELF
THE DIFFERENCE ONLY IS THAT THE POET POSSESSES A BETTER MENTAL MEMORY ON WHICH ACCOUNT HE IS ABLE TO RETAIN THE FEELING AND THE THOUGHT TILL THEY CAN BE EMBODIED BY MEANS OF WORDS A FACULTY WHICH THE OTHERS DO NOT POSSESS BUT THE TRANSITION FROM A COMMONPLACE NATURE
THE SWEET AIR CONTINUED HE OF THE POLICE OFFICE IN HIS DREAMY IMAGININGS HOW IT REMINDS ME OF THE VIOLETS IN THE GARDEN OF MY AUNT MAGDALENA YES THEN I WAS A LITTLE WILD BOY WHO DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL VERY REGULARLY O HEAVENS
IT IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE IS A MERE FABLE SUCH METEOROUS APPEARANCES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED IN THIS WAY THAT THEY ARE THE REFLECTIONS OF THE AURORA BOREALIS AND IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THEY ARE CAUSED PRINCIPALLY BY ELECTRICITY
HE HAD ON THE SHOES FOR AS YET NO LAWFUL OWNER HAD APPEARED TO CLAIM THEM AND BESIDES IT WAS SO VERY DIRTY OUT OF DOORS THEY WERE JUST THE THING FOR HIM HE THOUGHT THE BEGINNING OF THE POEM HE PRAISED WITH GREAT GENEROSITY HE EVEN FOUND THE IDEA ORIGINAL AND EFFECTIVE
WAS AGAIN SILENT GREAT HEAVEN WHAT IS COME TO ME
HE TOOK UPON HIM THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF THE OFFICER BUT AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN HE FELT HIMSELF IN HIS NEW SITUATION MUCH LESS CONTENTED AND NOW PREFERRED THE VERY THING WHICH BUT SOME MINUTES BEFORE HE HAD REJECTED SO THEN THE WATCHMAN WAS AGAIN WATCHMAN
BUT HERE THE GLASSES MAGNIFIED TO AN ASTONISHING DEGREE ON THE FLOOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM SAT LIKE A DALAI LAMA THE INSIGNIFICANT SELF OF THE PERSON QUITE CONFOUNDED AT HIS OWN GREATNESS HE THEN IMAGINED HE HAD GOT INTO A NEEDLE CASE FULL OF POINTED NEEDLES OF EVERY SIZE
HE FOUND HOWEVER A LITTLE SIDE DOOR OPEN AND THROUGH THIS HE WENT AND STEPPED INTO OUR NEW MARKET OF THE PRESENT TIME IT WAS A HUGE DESOLATE PLAIN SOME WILD BUSHES STOOD UP HERE AND THERE WHILE ACROSS THE FIELD FLOWED A BROAD CANAL OR RIVER
BUT THE SHOES MEANWHILE REMAINED BEHIND FOUR A MOMENT OF HEAD IMPORTANCE AN EVENING'S DRAMATIC READINGS A MOST STRANGE JOURNEY EVERY INHABITANT OF COPENHAGEN KNOWS FROM PERSONAL INSPECTION HOW THE ENTRANCE TO FREDERICK'S HOSPITAL LOOKS
THE COPYING CLERK TURNED ROUND AND SPOKE AWHILE WITH THE MAN ABOUT THE REPORTS AND LEGAL DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION BUT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED AND HIS EYE FELL AGAIN ON THE SHOES HE WAS UNABLE TO SAY WHETHER THOSE TO THE LEFT OR THOSE TO THE RIGHT BELONGED TO HIM
EVERY INCH A MAN RESEMBLING THE REAL PERSONAGES EVEN TO THE FINEST FEATURES AND BECOME THE HEROES OR HEROINES OF OUR WORLD OF DREAMS IN REALITY SUCH REMEMBRANCES ARE RATHER UNPLEASANT EVERY SIN EVERY EVIL THOUGHT MAY LIKE A CLOCK WITH ALARM OR CHIMES
HEM HEM SAID THE CLERK BREATHLESSLY AND QUITE EXHAUSTED HE SEATED HIMSELF ON A BANK
THE ENGLISH PIRATES HAD THEY SAID MOST SHAMEFULLY TAKEN THEIR SHIPS WHILE IN THE ROADSTEAD AND THE COUNCILLOR BEFORE WHOSE EYES THE HEROSTRATIC EVENT OF EIGHTEEN O ONE STILL FLOATED VIVIDLY
IT MUST BE HERE ON THIS VERY SPOT YET THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF RESEMBLANCE TO SUCH A DEGREE HAS EVERYTHING CHANGED THIS NIGHT AT ALL EVENTS HERE ARE SOME PEOPLE UP AND STIRRING OH OH I AM CERTAINLY VERY ILL HE NOW HIT UPON A HALF OPEN DOOR
MUST ALWAYS REMAIN HERE SITTING AT MY DESK IN THE OFFICE AND PATIENTLY SEE OTHER PEOPLE FETCH THEIR PASSPORTS TO GO ABROAD SUCH IS MY FATE
BUT WHAT SHE HAD YET TO PERFORM WAS SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL I MUST TELL YOU SAID SHE
WHILE THE SOUND PERSONS WENT AWAY THEY WERE NAMELY CASTS OF FEMALE FRIENDS WHOSE BODILY OR MENTAL DEFORMITIES WERE HERE MOST FAITHFULLY PRESERVED WITH THE SNAKE LIKE WRITHINGS OF AN IDEA HE GLIDED INTO ANOTHER FEMALE HEART BUT THIS SEEMED TO HIM LIKE A LARGE HOLY FANE
THE FIRST HEART THROUGH WHICH HE CAME WAS THAT OF A MIDDLE AGED LADY BUT HE INSTANTLY FANCIED HIMSELF IN THE ROOM OF THE INSTITUTION FOR THE CURE OF THE CROOKED AND DEFORMED WHERE CASTS OF MIS SHAPEN LIMBS ARE DISPLAYED IN NAKED REALITY ON THE WALL
YET THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTITUTION THE CASTS WERE TAKEN AT THE ENTRY OF THE PATIENT
TIS A BITTER CRUST ALAS AT WHICH I AM CONDEMNED TO GNAW NOBODY COULD BE MORE STEADY OR QUIET THAN THIS YOUNG MAN WE THEREFORE WISH HIM JOY OF THE EXCURSION WITH ALL OUR HEART AND
IN THAT LADY YONDER SO STRANGELY DRESSED I SHOULD FIND FOR CERTAIN A LARGE MILLINER'S SHOP IN THAT ONE THE SHOP IS EMPTY BUT IT WANTS CLEANING PLAIN ENOUGH
THE WELL KNOWN GROUP OF THE VIRGIN AND THE INFANT JESUS
IS THE MOST DREADFUL MOMENT OF MY LIFE THE WHOLE WORLD IS LEAGUED AGAINST ME
HE ASKED MECHANICALLY AS HE SAW THE HOSTESS PUSH ASIDE A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER THE MEANING OF THIS COUNCILLORSHIP QUERY REMAINED OF COURSE A RIDDLE TO HER YET SHE HANDED HIM THE PAPER WITHOUT REPLYING IT WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT REPRESENTING A SPLENDID METEOR
IN WHICH A CERTAIN PAIR OF MAGIC SPECTACLES DID HER ESSENTIAL SERVICE HER NEPHEW A MERRY BOY WHO WAS HIS AUNT'S DARLING BEGGED SO LONG FOR THESE SPECTACLES THAT AT LAST SHE LENT HIM THE TREASURE AFTER HAVING INFORMED HIM WITH MANY EXHORTATIONS
HE SAID HOW HAPPY YOU WILL BE I WILL DO MY BEST SAID THE INN KEEPER OF THE PONT DU GARD SHUTTING UP HIS KNIFE WELL THEN WE WILL GO INTO PARIS
DON'T THINK I WANT THE GLORY OF RIDING IN YOUR FINE CARRIAGE SAID HE OH NO IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I AM TIRED AND ALSO BECAUSE I HAVE A LITTLE BUSINESS TO TALK OVER WITH YOU
WHAT AN APPETITE YOU USED TO HAVE IS IT AS GOOD NOW OH YES REPLIED ANDREA LAUGHING
I AM YOUNG AND WILFUL BETWEEN PEOPLE LIKE US THREATS ARE OUT OF PLACE EVERYTHING SHOULD BE AMICABLY ARRANGED IS IT MY FAULT IF FORTUNE
THE MAN WHOSE HOUSE YOU HAVE JUST LEFT YES
YOU ARE NATURALLY AS SLIPPERY AS AN EEL IF I HAD MISSED YOU TO NIGHT I MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD ANOTHER CHANCE
THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART IF YOU HAVE TWO COATS YOU WILL GIVE ME ONE OF THEM I USED TO DIVIDE MY SOUP AND BEANS WITH YOU WHEN YOU WERE HUNGRY TRUE SAID ANDREA
IT IS SO WINDY THAT YOUR HAT CAN EASILY APPEAR TO HAVE BLOWN OFF COME COME ENOUGH OF THIS SAID CAVALCANTI
AND HAD RETURNED JUST AS THEY WERE STARTING BUT INSTEAD OF EITHER OF THESE HE SAW NOTHING BUT A STRANGE FACE SUNBURNT AND ENCIRCLED BY A BEARD WITH EYES BRILLIANT AS CARBUNCLES
THAT YOU ARE MISTAKEN WELL WELL DON'T BE ANGRY MY BOY YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHAT IT IS TO BE UNFORTUNATE AND MISFORTUNES MAKE US JEALOUS
WHO HAD NEVER TAKEN HIS EYES OFF HIS COMPANION PASSED HIS HAND BEHIND HIS BACK AND OPENED A LONG SPANISH KNIFE WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED WITH HIM TO BE READY IN CASE OF NEED
WERE SO FULL OF AFFABILITY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HANDS EVEN WITH THE BANKER'S SERVANTS SO MUCH DID THEIR GRATITUDE NEED AN OBJECT TO EXPEND ITSELF UPON ONE THING ABOVE ALL THE REST HEIGHTENED THE RESPECT
WELL I SHALL RENT A ROOM IN SOME RESPECTABLE HOUSE WEAR A DECENT COAT SHAVE EVERY DAY AND GO AND READ THE PAPERS IN A CAFE THEN IN THE EVENING I SHALL GO TO THE THEATRE
TORN AND FILTHY GARMENTS COVERED HIS LARGE BONY LIMBS WHICH SEEMED AS THOUGH LIKE THOSE OF A SKELETON THEY WOULD RATTLE AS HE WALKED AND THE HAND WITH WHICH HE LEANED UPON THE YOUNG MAN'S SHOULDER
HAS BEEN KIND TO ME FORTUNE HAS BEEN KIND TO YOU THEN YOUR TILBURY YOUR GROOM YOUR CLOTHES ARE NOT THEN HIRED GOOD
A PEER OF FRANCE AH SAID ANDREA WHO KNOWS MAJOR CAVALCANTI IS ALREADY ONE PERHAPS BUT THEN HEREDITARY RANK IS ABOLISHED
THE EVENING PASSED ON MADAME DE VILLEFORT EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO RETURN TO PARIS WHICH MADAME DANGLARS HAD NOT DARED TO DO NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNEASINESS SHE EXPERIENCED ON HIS WIFE'S REQUEST M DE VILLEFORT
AS YOU SAID JUST NOW YOU ARE A NATIVE OF MARSEILLES I AM DO YOU KNOW THEN NOW WHAT YOU ARE NO BUT I WAS BROUGHT UP IN CORSICA YOU ARE OLD AND OBSTINATE
RAGS ON MY BACK AND WORN OUT SHOES ON MY FEET YOU WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN ME YOU WRONG ME MY BOY NOW I HAVE FOUND YOU NOTHING PREVENTS MY BEING AS WELL DRESSED AS ANY ONE KNOWING AS I DO
ANDREA LOOKED AROUND IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD AND THEN STOPPING THE HORSE AND CROSSING HIS ARMS BEFORE THE MAN HE ASKED NOW
DO YOU THINK SO M BOSSUET AND YOU
NAY ALMOST THE VENERATION OF DANGLARS FOR CAVALCANTI THE LATTER FAITHFUL TO THE PRINCIPLE OF HORACE NIL ADMIRARI HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SHOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE
AS HE HAD HIMSELF OWNED THE REPUTED SON OF MAJOR CAVALCANTI WAS A WILFUL FELLOW HE DREW UP FOR A MINUTE THREW A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM AND THEN HIS HAND FELL INSTANTLY INTO HIS POCKET
WHERE IT BEGAN PLAYING WITH A PISTOL BUT MEANWHILE
DANGLARS THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT SUCH LUXURIES WERE COMMON AT THE TABLE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS DESCENDANT OF THE CAVALCANTI WHO MOST LIKELY IN LUCCA FED UPON TROUT BROUGHT FROM SWITZERLAND AND LOBSTERS SENT FROM ENGLAND
YES YOU IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT ME SINCE YOU INTEREST YOURSELF IN MY AFFAIRS I THINK IT IS NOW MY TURN TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS AH TRUE
THEN AFTER DINNER ON THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS HE QUESTIONED THE FATHER AND SON UPON THEIR MODE OF LIVING AND THE FATHER AND SON PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THROUGH DANGLARS THE ONE WAS TO RECEIVE HIS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
WITH HIS UNPLEASANT SMILE IT WAS VERY POLITE OF YOU COME SAID ANDREA WHAT DO YOU WANT YOU DO NOT SPEAK AFFECTIONATELY TO ME BENEDETTO MY OLD FRIEND
BUT HOW WILL YOU PASS THROUGH THE BARRIER WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION IT SEEMS TO ME
HE HAD NOTICED THE APPROACH OF VILLEFORT TO MADAME DANGLARS AND HE SOON GUESSED ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THOUGH THE WORDS HAD BEEN UTTERED IN SO LOW A VOICE
TO BE EXPERIENCED OF THE WORLD AND OF THE VICE AND VIRTUE OF MANKIND BUT I PUT FORTH ON THE HIGH OPEN SEA WITH ONE SOLE SHIP AND THAT SMALL COMPANY BY WHICH I NEVER HAD DESERTED BEEN
AND THREATENING WITH HIS FINGER FIERCELY AND HEARD HIM CALLED GERI DEL BELLO SO WHOLLY AT THAT TIME WAST THOU IMPEDED BY HIM WHO FORMERLY HELD ALTAFORTE THOU DIDST NOT LOOK THAT WAY
AFTER THE FIRE A LITTLE MORE HAD ROARED IN ITS OWN FASHION THE SHARP POINT IT MOVED THIS WAY AND THAT AND THEN GAVE FORTH SUCH BREATH
WHENCE HE ACCUMULATING WOE ON WOE DEPARTED LIKE A PERSON SAD AND CRAZED BUT I REMAINED TO LOOK UPON THE CROWD AND SAW A THING WHICH I SHOULD BE AFRAID WITHOUT SOME FURTHER PROOF EVEN TO RECOUNT
IF I WERE ONLY STILL SO LIGHT THAT IN A HUNDRED YEARS I COULD ADVANCE ONE INCH I HAD ALREADY STARTED ON THE WAY SEEKING HIM OUT AMONG THIS SQUALID FOLK ALTHOUGH THE CIRCUIT BE ELEVEN MILES AND BE NOT LESS THAN HALF A MILE ACROSS
AND PENITENT AND CONFESSING I SURRENDERED AH WOE IS ME AND IT WOULD HAVE BESTEAD ME
WHEN WAS THE AIR SO FULL OF PESTILENCE THE ANIMALS DOWN TO THE LITTLE WORM ALL FELL AND AFTERWARDS THE ANCIENT PEOPLE ACCORDING AS THE POETS HAVE AFFIRMED WERE FROM THE SEED OF ANTS RESTORED AGAIN
HE MUST COME DOWN AMONG MY SERVITORS BECAUSE HE GAVE THE FRAUDULENT ADVICE FROM WHICH TIME FORTH I HAVE BEEN AT HIS HAIR FOR WHO REPENTS NOT CANNOT BE ABSOLVED NOR CAN ONE BOTH REPENT AND WILL AT ONCE
THAT SO DISPROPORTIONS THE LIMBS WITH HUMOURS WHICH IT ILL CONCOCTS THAT THE FACE CORRESPONDS NOT TO THE BELLY COMPELLED HIM SO TO HOLD HIS LIPS APART AS DOES THE HECTIC WHO BECAUSE OF THIRST ONE TOW'RDS THE CHIN
SPREAD OUT THE NETS THAT I MAY TAKE THE LIONESS AND HER WHELPS UPON THE PASSAGE AND THEN EXTENDED HIS UNPITYING CLAWS SEIZING THE FIRST WHO HAD THE NAME LEARCHUS AND WHIRLED HIM ROUND AND DASHED HIM ON A ROCK AND SHE
AND THOU INSTRUCT ME HOW TO RAZE PALESTRINA TO THE GROUND HEAVEN HAVE I POWER TO LOCK AND TO UNLOCK AS THOU DOST KNOW THEREFORE THE KEYS ARE TWO THE WHICH MY PREDECESSOR HELD NOT DEAR
BUT OPEN WAR I NONE HAVE LEFT THERE NOW RAVENNA STANDS AS IT LONG YEARS HAS STOOD THE EAGLE OF POLENTA THERE IS BROODING SO THAT SHE COVERS CERVIA WITH HER VANS
THE OTHER UPWARD TURNS O YE WHO WITHOUT ANY TORMENT ARE AND WHY I KNOW NOT IN THE WORLD OF WOE HE SAID TO US BEHOLD AND BE ATTENTIVE UNTO THE MISERY OF MASTER ADAM
BEHOLD IF ANY BE AS GREAT AS THIS AND SO THAT THOU MAY CARRY NEWS OF ME
BUT FOR THE HIGH PRIEST WHOM MAY ILL BETIDE WHO PUT ME BACK INTO MY FORMER SINS AND HOW AND WHEREFORE I WILL HAVE THEE HEAR WHILE I WAS STILL THE FORM OF BONE AND PULP MY MOTHER GAVE TO ME THE DEEDS I DID WERE NOT THOSE OF A LION BUT A FOX
THIS IS HE AND HE SPEAKS NOT THIS ONE BEING BANISHED EVERY DOUBT SUBMERGED IN CAESAR BY AFFIRMING THE FOREARMED ALWAYS WITH DETRIMENT ALLOWED DELAY
AND NEVER SAW I PLIED A CURRYCOMB BY STABLE BOY FOR WHOM HIS MASTER WAITS OR HIM WHO KEEPS AWAKE UNWILLINGLY AS EVERY ONE WAS PLYING FAST THE BITE OF NAILS UPON HIMSELF FOR THE GREAT RAGE OF ITCHING
WHO ENTWINED EIGHT TIMES HIS TAIL ABOUT HIS STUBBORN BACK AND AFTER HE HAD BITTEN IT IN GREAT RAGE SAID OF THE THIEVISH FIRE A CULPRIT THIS
AND WHERE HIS WIT THE ABBAGLIATO PROFFERED BUT THAT THOU KNOW WHO THUS DOTH SECOND THEE AGAINST THE SIENESE MAKE SHARP THINE EYE TOW'RDS ME SO THAT MY FACE WELL ANSWER THEE
LIVES BETWEEN TYRANNY AND A FREE STATE NOW I ENTREAT THEE TELL US WHO THOU ART BE NOT MORE STUBBORN THAN THE REST HAVE BEEN
BUT FOR PURSUIT OF VIRTUE AND OF KNOWLEDGE SO EAGER DID I RENDER MY COMPANIONS WITH THIS BRIEF EXHORTATION FOR THE VOYAGE THAT THEN I HARDLY COULD HAVE HELD THEM BACK AND HAVING TURNED OUR STERN UNTO THE MORNING
THEN URGED ME ON HIS WEIGHTY ARGUMENTS THERE WHERE MY SILENCE WAS THE WORST ADVICE AND SAID I FATHER SINCE THOU WASHEST ME OF THAT SIN INTO WHICH I NOW MUST FALL
BOTH OF THE SHORES I SAW AS FAR AS SPAIN FAR AS MOROCCO AND THE ISLE OF SARDES AND THE OTHERS WHICH THAT SEA BATHES ROUND ABOUT I AND MY COMPANY WERE OLD AND SLOW
AS I GREW AWARE AS SOON AS I WAS WHERE THE DEPTH APPEARED AND SUCH AS HE WHO WITH THE BEARS AVENGED HIM BEHELD ELIJAH'S CHARIOT AT DEPARTING WHAT TIME THE STEEDS TO HEAVEN ERECT UPROSE
THAN WAS IT TO BEHOLD THROUGH THAT DARK VALLEY THE SPIRITS LANGUISHING IN DIVERS HEAPS THIS ON THE BELLY THAT UPON THE BACK ONE OF THE OTHER LAY AND OTHERS CRAWLING SHIFTED THEMSELVES ALONG THE DISMAL ROAD
NOT HAVING POWER TO SPEAK FOR TO EXCUSE MYSELF I WISHED AND STILL EXCUSED MYSELF AND DID NOT THINK I DID IT LESS SHAME DOTH WASH AWAY A GREATER FAULT THE MASTER SAID THAN THIS OF THINE HAS BEEN
BY REASON OF OUR SPEECH AND MEMORY THAT HAVE SMALL ROOM TO COMPREHEND SO MUCH IF WERE AGAIN ASSEMBLED ALL THE PEOPLE WHICH FORMERLY UPON THE FATEFUL LAND OF PUGLIA
O HOW BEWILDERED UNTO ME APPEARED WITH TONGUE ASUNDER IN HIS WINDPIPE SLIT CURIO WHO IN SPEAKING WAS SO BOLD AND ONE WHO BOTH HIS HANDS DISSEVERED HAD
AND SAID O THOU WHOM GUILT DOTH NOT CONDEMN AND WHOM I ONCE SAW UP IN LATIAN LAND UNLESS TOO GREAT SIMILITUDE DECEIVE ME
HIS SON BUT UNTO THE LAST BOLGIA OF THE TEN FOR ALCHEMY WHICH IN THE WORLD I PRACTISED
BUT CATHERINE HEARD NEITHER THE PARTICULARS NOR THE RESULT HER COMPANION'S DISCOURSE NOW SUNK FROM ITS HITHERTO ANIMATED PITCH TO NOTHING MORE THAN A SHORT DECISIVE SENTENCE OF PRAISE OR CONDEMNATION ON THE FACE OF EVERY WOMAN THEY MET AND CATHERINE
HE SAID LIGHTLY THE HORSES HAVE RESTED I THINK
SO WHAT MATTERS AFTER ALL WE RESERVE THE RIGHT HOWEVER TO DO HOMAGE TO THE QUEEN WHO RULES OVER THESE WISE OLD HILLS I OFFER YOU THE HUMBLE SERVICES OF MYSELF AND MY COMPANIONS WE ARE YOURS TO COMMAND
IT REQUIRES UNCOMMON STEADINESS OF REASON TO RESIST THE ATTRACTION OF BEING CALLED THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN THE WORLD
WHETHER IN QUEST OF PASTRY MILLINERY OR EVEN AS IN THE PRESENT CASE OF YOUNG MEN ARE NOT DETAINED ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER BY CARRIAGES HORSEMEN OR CARTS
IT WOULD BE USELESS TO DENY THE STORY THESE MEN WOULD NOT BELIEVE HER IN A FLASH
IT REMAINED ONLY FOR HER TO IMPRESS UPON AUNT FANNY THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS RESOLUTION WHAT WISE OLD HILLS THEY MUST BE SHE SAID WITH EVASIVE ENTHUSIASM YOU CANNOT EXPECT ME TO ADMIT HOWEVER THAT I AM THE PRINCESS SHE WENT ON
WITH ITS GALLANT SMILE AND OMINOUS PATCH SHE HESITATED FEAR ENTERING HER SOUL ONCE MORE
AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK HE DID MISS MORLAND I AM SURE I CANNOT GUESS AT ALL CURRICLE HUNG YOU SEE SEAT TRUNK SWORD CASE SPLASHING BOARD LAMPS SILVER MOULDING ALL YOU SEE COMPLETE THE IRON WORK AS GOOD AS NEW OR BETTER
LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET FROM WHERE THE COACH WAS STANDING HE TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND WAS LOST AMONG THE ROCKS AHEAD FOUR HORSES COVERED WITH SWEAT WERE PANTING AND HEAVING AS IF IN GREAT DISTRESS AFTER THEIR MAD RUN
I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL TOGETHER WHILE YOU ARE IN BATH SHE IS A MOST AMIABLE GIRL SUCH A SUPERIOR UNDERSTANDING HOW FOND ALL THE FAMILY ARE OF HER SHE IS EVIDENTLY THE GENERAL FAVOURITE
SAID THE MAN MOCKINGLY BEVERLY LOOKED AT HIM APPEALINGLY
IS YO DAID YIT MISS BEV'LY IS DE END CAME MOANED AUNT FANNY BEVERLY COULD NOT REPRESS A SMILE I AM QUITE ALIVE AUNTIE THESE MEN WILL NOT HURT US THEY ARE VERY NICE GENTLEMEN
I KNOW OF A PLACE WHERE YOU MAY SPEND THE NIGHT COMFORTABLY AND BE REFRESHED FOR THE ROUGH JOURNEY TO MORROW TO MORROW HOW CAN I GO ON I AM ALONE SHE CRIED DESPAIRINGLY
DRIVEN ALONG ON BAD PAVEMENT BY A MOST KNOWING LOOKING COACHMAN WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE THAT COULD MOST FITLY ENDANGER THE LIVES OF HIMSELF HIS COMPANION AND HIS HORSE OH THESE ODIOUS GIGS SAID ISABELLA LOOKING UP HOW I DETEST THEM
YES VERY KIND I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY BEFORE
MAY BE PROUD OF INDEED I AM SHE REPLIED I LOVE HER EXCEEDINGLY AND AM DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT YOU LIKE HER TOO YOU HARDLY MENTIONED ANYTHING OF HER WHEN YOU WROTE TO ME AFTER YOUR VISIT THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SHOULD SOON SEE YOU MYSELF
THE RAUCOUS VOICE OF THE DRIVER WAS HEARD CALLING TO HIS HORSES
HER BROTHER TOLD HER THAT IT WAS TWENTY THREE MILES THREE AND TWENTY CRIED THORPE FIVE AND TWENTY IF IT IS AN INCH MORLAND REMONSTRATED PLEADED THE AUTHORITY OF ROAD BOOKS INNKEEPERS AND MILESTONES
RENEWED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HIS GIG YOU WILL FIND HOWEVER MISS MORLAND IT WOULD BE RECKONED A CHEAP THING BY SOME PEOPLE FOR I MIGHT HAVE SOLD IT FOR TEN GUINEAS MORE THE NEXT DAY JACKSON OF ORIEL BID ME SIXTY AT ONCE MORLAND WAS WITH ME AT THE TIME
AND THREADING THE GUTTERS OF THAT INTERESTING ALLEY
AND TOO MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN UNLESS HE WERE EASY WHERE HE OUGHT TO BE CIVIL AND IMPUDENT WHERE HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO BE EASY HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IT FROM TETBURY MISS MORLAND I DO NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE
THIS CRITIQUE THE JUSTNESS OF WHICH WAS UNFORTUNATELY LOST ON POOR CATHERINE BROUGHT THEM TO THE DOOR OF MISSUS THORPE'S LODGINGS AND THE FEELINGS OF THE DISCERNING AND UNPREJUDICED READER OF CAMILLA GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS OF THE DUTIFUL AND AFFECTIONATE SON
I TOOK UP THE FIRST VOLUME ONCE AND LOOKED IT OVER BUT I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO INDEED I GUESSED WHAT SORT OF STUFF IT MUST BE BEFORE I SAW IT
IT IS INDEED A STREET OF SO IMPERTINENT A NATURE SO UNFORTUNATELY CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT LONDON AND OXFORD ROADS AND THE PRINCIPAL INN OF THE CITY THAT A DAY NEVER PASSES IN WHICH PARTIES OF LADIES HOWEVER IMPORTANT THEIR BUSINESS
LOOK AT THAT CREATURE AND SUPPOSE IT POSSIBLE IF YOU CAN HE DOES LOOK VERY HOT TO BE SURE HOT HE HAD NOT TURNED A HAIR TILL WE CAME TO WALCOT CHURCH
SHE IS JUST THE KIND OF YOUNG WOMAN I COULD WISH TO SEE YOU ATTACHED TO SHE HAS SO MUCH GOOD SENSE AND IS SO THOROUGHLY UNAFFECTED AND AMIABLE I ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO KNOW HER AND SHE SEEMS VERY FOND OF YOU SHE SAID THE HIGHEST THINGS IN YOUR PRAISE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
SUCH AS REPELLING BRIGANDS WHO SUDDENLY APPEAR UPON THE SCENE YES MAY I ASK WHY YOU DID NOT USE IT THIS EVENING BECAUSE IT IS LOCKED UP IN ONE OF MY BAGS I DON'T KNOW JUST WHICH ONE AND AUNT FANNY HAS THE KEY
AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
THE SERVANT HAD JUST MOUNTED THE CARRIAGE AND WAS DRIVING OFF SUCH TRUE BLOOD
WE ARE NOT SO FAR FROM THE WORLD AFTER ALL WE ROUGH PEOPLE OF THE HILLS
AND THERE WAS A TINGE OF POLITE IRONY IN THE TONES BUT ALL PEOPLE ARE ALIKE IN THE MOUNTAINS THE KING AND THE THIEF THE PRINCESS AND THE JADE LIVE IN THE COMMON FOLD AND HIS HAT SWUNG SO LOW THAT IT TOUCHED THE GROUND
AND BESIDES YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WAY AREN'T YOU GOING TO ROB US DEMANDED BEVERLY HOPE SPRINGING TO THE SURFACE WITH A JOYFUL BOUND THE STRANGER LAUGHED HEARTILY AND SHOOK HIS HEAD DO WE NOT LOOK LIKE HONEST MEN
THE MAN SHE HAD FIRST OBSERVED STOPPED NEAR THE HORSES HEADS AND PEERED INTENTLY AT HER FROM BENEATH A BROAD AND RAKISH HAT HE WAS TALL AND APPEARED TO BE MORE RESPECTABLY CLAD THAN HIS FELLOWS
FOR THE KANAKA IN HIS CANOE FOR THE FISHERMAN THE STEVEDORE THE PORTER BROADER AND DEEPER WE MUST WRITE OUR ANNALS FROM AN ETHICAL REFORMATION FROM AN INFLUX OF THE EVER NEW
IN MAN WE STILL TRACE THE REMAINS OR HINTS OF ALL THAT WE ESTEEM BADGES OF SERVITUDE IN THE LOWER RACES YET IN HIM THEY ENHANCE HIS NOBLENESS AND GRACE
THE REFORMATION THE DISCOVERY OF NEW LANDS THE OPENING OF NEW SCIENCES AND NEW REGIONS IN MAN HE SHALL BE THE PRIEST OF PAN
WHAT APPEARS ONCE IN THE ATMOSPHERE MAY APPEAR OFTEN AND IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE ARCHETYPE OF THAT FAMILIAR ORNAMENT I HAVE SEEN IN THE SKY A CHAIN OF SUMMER LIGHTNING
WE PUT OURSELVES INTO THE PLACE AND STATE OF THE BUILDER WE REMEMBER THE FOREST DWELLERS THE FIRST TEMPLES THE ADHERENCE TO THE FIRST TYPE AND THE DECORATION OF IT AS THE WEALTH OF THE NATION INCREASED
HISTORY NO LONGER SHALL BE A DULL BOOK IT SHALL WALK INCARNATE IN EVERY JUST AND WISE MAN
WHO DOES NOT SEE THAT THIS IS A GANG OF GREAT BOYS WITH SUCH A CODE OF HONOR AND SUCH LAX DISCIPLINE AS GREAT BOYS HAVE THE COSTLY CHARM OF THE ANCIENT TRAGEDY AND INDEED OF ALL THE OLD LITERATURE IS THAT THE PERSONS SPEAK SIMPLY
ESPECIALLY IN WINTER WHEN THE BARRENNESS OF ALL OTHER TREES SHOWS THE LOW ARCH OF THE SAXONS IN THE WOODS IN A WINTER AFTERNOON ONE WILL SEE AS READILY THE ORIGIN OF THE STAINED GLASS WINDOW
WHILST NOW WE PRAY WITH THE UTMOST COLDNESS AND VERY SELDOM
BESIDES THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS INDIVIDUALS WHO RETAIN THESE CHARACTERISTICS A PERSON OF CHILDLIKE GENIUS AND INBORN ENERGY
NOT OF HIMSELF BUT MORE SWEET OF THAT CHARACTER HE SEEKS IN EVERY WORD THAT IS SAID CONCERNING CHARACTER YEA FURTHER IN EVERY FACT AND CIRCUMSTANCE
SEE IN GOETHE'S HELENA THE SAME DESIRE THAT EVERY WORD SHOULD BE A THING THESE FIGURES HE WOULD SAY
ALONG THE SIDES OF THE STONE WALL WHICH OBVIOUSLY GAVE THE IDEA OF THE COMMON ARCHITECTURAL SCROLL
UNDER THIS MASK DID MY PROTEUS NATURE HIDE ITSELF THIS REMEDIES THE DEFECT OF OUR TOO GREAT NEARNESS TO OURSELVES THIS THROWS OUR ACTIONS INTO PERSPECTIVE
EVERY THOUGHT EVERY EMOTION WHICH BELONGS TO IT IN APPROPRIATE EVENTS BUT THE THOUGHT IS ALWAYS PRIOR TO THE FACT
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT COMMON SOULS PAY WITH WHAT THEY DO NOBLER SOULS WITH THAT WHICH THEY ARE AND WHY BECAUSE A PROFOUND NATURE AWAKENS IN US BY ITS ACTIONS AND WORDS BY ITS VERY LOOKS AND MANNERS
PROPERTY ALSO HOLDS OF THE SOUL COVERS GREAT SPIRITUAL FACTS AND INSTINCTIVELY WE AT FIRST HOLD TO IT WITH SWORDS AND LAWS AND WIDE AND COMPLEX COMBINATIONS
OF THAT WHICH IN GRAVE EARNEST THE MIND OF THAT PERIOD TOILED TO ACHIEVE MAGIC AND ALL THAT IS ASCRIBED TO IT
EVERY REVOLUTION WAS FIRST A THOUGHT IN ONE MAN'S MIND AND WHEN THE SAME THOUGHT OCCURS TO ANOTHER MAN IT IS THE KEY TO THAT ERA EVERY REFORM WAS ONCE A PRIVATE OPINION
WHAT DO I KNOW SYMPATHETICALLY MORALLY OF EITHER OF THESE WORLDS OF LIFE AS OLD AS THE CAUCASIAN MAN PERHAPS OLDER
THE GOTHIC CHURCH PLAINLY ORIGINATED IN A RUDE ADAPTATION OF THE FOREST TREES
EVERY PLANT EVERY ANIMAL IN ITS GROWTH TEACHES THE UNITY OF CAUSE THE VARIETY OF APPEARANCE UPBORNE AND SURROUNDED AS WE ARE BY THIS ALL CREATING NATURE
SERVE THEM FACTS ENCUMBER THEM TYRANNIZE OVER THEM AND MAKE THE MEN OF ROUTINE THE MEN OF SENSE IN WHOM A LITERAL OBEDIENCE TO FACTS HAS EXTINGUISHED EVERY SPARK OF THAT LIGHT BY WHICH MAN IS TRULY MAN
THESE HINTS DROPPED AS IT WERE FROM SLEEP AND NIGHT LET US USE IN BROAD DAY THE STUDENT IS TO READ HISTORY ACTIVELY AND NOT PASSIVELY
NOMADISM AND AGRICULTURE ARE THE TWO ANTAGONIST FACTS THE GEOGRAPHY OF ASIA AND OF AFRICA
HIS OWN SECRET BIOGRAPHY HE FINDS IN LINES WONDERFULLY INTELLIGIBLE TO HIM DOTTED DOWN BEFORE HE WAS BORN ONE AFTER ANOTHER HE COMES UP IN HIS PRIVATE ADVENTURES WITH EVERY FABLE OF AESOP OF HOMER OF HAFIZ
THE PROPERTIES OF STONE WATER AND WOOD
AND VERIFIES THEM WITH HIS OWN HEAD AND HANDS THE BEAUTIFUL FABLES OF THE GREEKS BEING PROPER CREATIONS OF THE IMAGINATION AND NOT OF THE FANCY ARE UNIVERSAL VERITIES WHAT A RANGE OF MEANINGS AND WHAT PERPETUAL PERTINENCE HAS THE STORY OF PROMETHEUS
AND SHAKSPEARE'S STRAIN ONE HISTORY THERE IS ONE MIND COMMON TO ALL INDIVIDUAL MEN EVERY MAN IS AN INLET TO THE SAME AND TO ALL OF THE SAME
IS THAT CONTINENCE OR CONTENT WHICH FINDS ALL THE ELEMENTS OF LIFE IN ITS OWN SOIL AND
TANTALUS IS BUT A NAME FOR YOU AND ME TANTALUS MEANS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DRINKING THE WATERS OF THOUGHT WHICH ARE ALWAYS GLEAMING AND WAVING WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SOUL THE TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULS IS NO FABLE I WOULD IT WERE BUT MEN AND WOMEN ARE ONLY HALF HUMAN
ALL EVENTS PROFITABLE ALL DAYS HOLY ALL MEN DIVINE FOR THE EYE IS FASTENED ON THE LIFE AND SLIGHTS THE CIRCUMSTANCE EVERY CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
THESE PROPENSITIES STILL FIGHT OUT THE OLD BATTLE IN THE NATION AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL THE NOMADS OF AFRICA WERE CONSTRAINED TO WANDER BY THE ATTACKS OF THE GAD FLY
ONE HARDLY A YOUNG MAN BUT WHO HOWEVER BEHAVED HIMSELF SO ADMIRABLY ON THIS OCCASION THAT I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF RECOMMENDING HIM TO YOUR MAJESTY HOW DOES HE CALL HIMSELF D'ARTAGNAN SIRE
ALTHOUGH HE PLAYED WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE FOUND THAT HIS WOUND WAS YET TOO RECENT TO ALLOW OF SUCH EXERTION
TWO OR THREE TIMES BAH PREOCCUPIED AS MONSIEUR WAS WITH THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED HE DID NOT OBSERVE THAT BUT I WHOM THE STRANGE FASHION IN WHICH THAT LETTER CAME INTO THE HOUSE HAD PLACED ON MY GUARD I DID NOT LOSE A MOVEMENT OF HIS FEATURES
THE CARDINAL IS NOT THE MAN TO FORGET A MYSTIFICATION UNTIL HE HAS SETTLED ACCOUNT WITH THE MYSTIFIER AND THE MYSTIFIER APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE THE AIR OF BEING A CERTAIN YOUNG GASCON OF MY ACQUAINTANCE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CARDINAL IS AS WELL POSTED AS YOURSELF
DOES NOT FIND SUCH STONES IN HIS MOTHER'S JEWEL CASE YOU THINK THEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO DREAD ASKED D'ARTAGNAN I MEAN TO SAY YOUNG MAN THAT HE WHO SLEEPS OVER A MINE THE MATCH OF WHICH IS ALREADY LIGHTED
LOOK AT ME AS LONG AS YOU LIKE MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE SAID
AND LET US ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE KING BEFORE HE IS PREJUDICED BY THE CARDINAL
HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
DID I NOT GUESS TRULY IS IT NOT SOME BAD AFFAIR
AND YOU FOUND IT TRAITOROUS MONSIEUR INDEED
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU MY DEAR HOST SO MUCH THE WORSE WHEN I AM HAPPY I WISH ALL THE WORLD TO BE SO BUT IT APPEARS THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE THE YOUNG MAN DEPARTED LAUGHING AT THE JOKE WHICH HE THOUGHT HE ALONE COULD COMPREHEND AMUSE YOURSELF WELL REPLIED BONACIEUX
YOU ARE RIGHT TREVILLE BUT THEY WERE NOT ALONE YOUR MUSKETEERS THEY HAD A YOUTH WITH THEM YES SIRE AND ONE WOUNDED MAN SO THAT THREE OF THE KING'S MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM WAS WOUNDED
WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
THE DOORS OF WHICH THEY CLOSED JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR ENEMIES FROM ENTERING WITH THEM AS TO THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN AT ONCE AND AS WE HAVE SAID IN A VERY BAD STATE
AND AS HE DECLARED HE WAS TOO IGNORANT OF THE GAME TO PLAY IT REGULARLY THEY ONLY CONTINUED GIVING BALLS TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT COUNTING
IT IS AS I HAVE THE HONOR TO RELATE IT TO YOUR MAJESTY JUSSAC ONE OF THE FIRST SWORDSMEN IN THE KINGDOM WELL SIRE FOR ONCE HE FOUND HIS MASTER I WILL SEE THIS YOUNG MAN TREVILLE I WILL SEE HIM AND IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE
HER MAJESTY DID ME THE HONOR TO GRANT ME THAT FAVOR AND THAT IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES IMPRUDENT THRICE IMPRUDENT
DID NOT INSPIRE HIM WITH THE LEAST SUSPICION OF HIS PRETTY HOSTESS
IN WHOSE SERVICE HE HAD A RELATIVE
THAT IS TRUE SAID THE KING BUT NEVER MIND TREVILLE COME STILL BY THE BACK STAIRCASE TREVILLE SMILED BUT AS IT WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO HAVE PREVAILED UPON THIS CHILD TO REBEL AGAINST HIS MASTER
AND ALL THE FAULT IS WITH YOUR MUSKETEERS
AND BY AND BY BY AND BY WE WILL SEE AH SIRE IT IS BECAUSE I CONFIDE IN THAT JUSTICE THAT I SHALL WAIT PATIENTLY AND QUIETLY THE GOOD PLEASURE OF YOUR MAJESTY
OH THE WOMEN THE WOMEN CRIED THE OLD SOLDIER I KNOW THEM BY THEIR ROMANTIC IMAGINATION EVERYTHING THAT SAVORS OF MYSTERY CHARMS THEM SO YOU HAVE SEEN THE ARM THAT WAS ALL YOU WOULD MEET THE QUEEN AND SHE WOULD NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE
AH I HAD EIGHTY LOUIS BEFORE ME PUT DOWN THE SAME SUM SO THAT THEY WHO HAVE LOST MAY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF JUSTICE BEFORE EVERYTHING
THE KING THEREFORE AROSE A MINUTE AFTER AND PUTTING THE MONEY WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM INTO HIS POCKET
EVERYONE TO RETURN HOME AND WAIT FOR NEWS
THE TRIUMPH OF THE QUEEN AND THE HUMILIATION OF HIS EMINENCE YOU MUST LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF WHAT HAVE I TO FEAR REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN AS LONG AS I SHALL HAVE THE LUCK TO ENJOY THE FAVOR OF THEIR MAJESTIES EVERYTHING BELIEVE ME
WHOSE RELATIVE AS WE ALREADY KNOW BERNAJOUX WAS
THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME MAGIC UNDERNEATH MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN HAD DARTED IN TO HIS CHAMBER AND OPENED THE LETTER
AH THAT'S QUITE ANOTHER THING BUT PROMISE ME IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE KILLED TONIGHT THAT YOU WILL GO TOMORROW I PROMISE IT DO YOU NEED MONEY
WHERE MY FRIENDS STILL REMAIN AND YOU HAVE RETURNED HAVE YOU NOT
HIS VISIT OF THE DAY BEFORE IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED HAD BEEN VERY SHORT AND VERY LITTLE EXPLICATIVE HE FOUND TREVILLE IN A JOYFUL MOOD HE HAD THOUGHT THE KING AND QUEEN CHARMING AT THE BALL IT IS TRUE THE CARDINAL HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY ILL TEMPERED
NOW LET US TALK ABOUT YOURSELF MY YOUNG FRIEND
IT IS USELESS TO LET THE CARDINAL KNOW YES SIRE YOU UNDERSTAND TREVILLE AN EDICT IS STILL AN EDICT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT AFTER ALL BUT THIS ENCOUNTER SIRE IS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF A DUEL IT IS A BRAWL
WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO DESIGNATE DURING HIS ACCOUNT BY THE TITLE OF THE CARDINAL'S EXECUTIONER AND EXPATIATED AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE BASTILLE THE BOLTS THE WICKETS THE DUNGEONS THE GRATINGS THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
NEITHER OF THEM HAD RETURNED THEIR LACKEYS LIKEWISE WERE ABSENT AND NOTHING HAD BEEN HEARD OF EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER
WELL THEN I COUNT ON YOU AT THE APPOINTED HOUR I SHALL BE READY
THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THEIR YOUNG COMPANION GO OUT WHO AS HE HAD TOLD THE GUARDSMAN OF HIS EMINENCE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE DOOR AN INSTANT AFTER THE GUARDSMAN DESCENDED IN HIS TURN
SO TRIFLING INDEED THAT D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT PERCEIVE IT ANY MORE THAN HE HAD THE MOMENTARY SHADE WHICH AN INSTANT BEFORE HAD DARKENED THE COUNTENANCE OF THE WORTHY MAN AH MAY YOU BE A TRUE PROPHET SAID D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING NO
BUT WHY THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WITH HIM I WATCHED YOU WITHOUT LISTENING TO YOU
HE APPEARED TO HER WITHOUT ELEGANCE OR GRACE AND NOT WELL BRED BUT ACTIVE CLEAR SIGHTED FULL OF RESOURCE AND NOT TOO GREAT A BORE SHE STILL MADE FUN OF HIM BUT HE HAD NOW WON HER INTEREST ONE DAY SHE WISHED TO TEST HIM
AND HOLDING THE INFANT JESUS IN HER ARMS WHAT STRIKES ONE FIRST WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THIS FIGURE IS THE PROPORTION THE BODY FROM THE NECK TO THE FEET IS ONLY TWICE AS LONG AS THE HEAD SO THAT IT APPEARS EXTREMELY SHORT AND PODGY
SAINT MARTHA A BELLY SAINT BARBARA HIPS
AND IN IT I DISCOVERED A PAINTING BY MARGARITONE A SAINT FRANCIS THE PIOUS SADNESS OF WHICH MOVED ME TO TEARS I WAS DEEPLY TOUCHED
AND HE USED THEM IN ALL THEIR PURITY WITHOUT EVER MODIFYING THE TONES FROM THIS IT FOLLOWS THAT HIS COLOURING HAS MORE VIVACITY THAN HARMONY THE CHEEKS OF THE VIRGIN AND THOSE OF THE CHILD ARE OF A BRIGHT VERMILION
WHILST MERCENARY GIRLS DO IT TOO MUCH AND WITHOUT GETTING ANY ENJOYMENT OUT OF IT IT IS INDEED DEPLORABLE
WHICH THE FRENZIED CUPIDITY OF MANUFACTURERS HURLS LIKE A JUGGERNAUT'S CAR UPON THE BEWILDERED PEOPLE AND OF WHICH THE IDLE AND FASHIONABLE MAKE A FOOLISH THOUGH FATAL ELEGANCE WILL SOON BEGIN TO PERFORM ITS TRUE FUNCTION
AT THAT PARTY EVELINE HAD BEEN MUCH NOTICED AND HAD ATTRACTED THE SPECIAL ATTENTION OF A YOUNG DIPLOMAT CALLED ROGER LAMBILLY WHO IMAGINING THAT SHE BELONGED TO A RATHER FAST SET INVITED HER TO HIS BACHELOR'S FLAT SHE THOUGHT HIM HANDSOME AND BELIEVED HIM RICH
WHO ABOUT EIGHTEEN FORTY AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY BECAME SPECTACLED PROFESSORS AND FOUNDED THE CULT OF THE PRIMITIVES
BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE PARTICULARLY PROUD OF IN THAT FOR IT IS A STATE THEY SHARE IN COMMON WITH COWS AND PIGS
SAYS THE REVERED MAC SILLY ATTAINS THE TRANSCENDENT END OF ART IT INSPIRES ITS BEHOLDERS WITH FEELINGS OF INNOCENCE AND PURITY IT MAKES THEM LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN AND SO TRUE IS THIS THAT AT THE AGE OF SIXTY SIX
AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES WERE SOON TO BE AVENGED FOR THIS CRUEL CONTEMPT THERE WAS BORN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN THE BIBLICAL VILLAGES AND REFORMED COTTAGES OF PIOUS ENGLAND A MULTITUDE OF LITTLE SAMUELS AND LITTLE SAINT JOHNS WITH HAIR CURLING LIKE LAMBS
EVEN THEN WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT REALLY TAKES PLACE FOR THE REASON THAT WHAT IS HIDDEN IS NOT SEEN THIS IS A CONDITION NECESSARY TO THE EXISTENCE OF ALL SOCIETY
AND SAINT GEORGE WILL DISPLAY BENEATH HIS ARMOUR THE MUSCULAR WEALTH OF A ROBUST VIRILITY
CROWDS OF TUMULTUOUS NATIVITIES OPULENT HOLY FAMILIES EMPHATIC CRUCIFIXIONS
FOR THE SEEDS OF THESE PLANTS GERMINATE IN THE PERICARP THE SELF IMPORTANCE WHICH THE PENGUIN LADIES GIVE THEMSELVES DOES NOT GO SO FAR BACK AS THAT
MARGARITONE'S VISION
SEEING THAT SHE WAS SUCCEEDING AND DOING HIM CREDIT LIKED HER STILL MORE HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO FALL MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER HENCEFORTH IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING SHE BEGAN TO OBSERVE HIM WITH INTEREST BEING CURIOUS TO SEE IF HIS PASSION WOULD INCREASE
AND WHEN THE MAID IN MY BOARDING HOUSE HAD SERVED MY MEAL I KEPT POURING SPOONFULS OF SOUP INTO MY EAR WITH ALL THE ARTLESSNESS OF CHILDHOOD IT IS BY SUCH RESULTS ADDS MAC SILLY THAT THE EXCELLENCE OF A WORK OF ART IS PROVED
RESPECTABLE YOUNG GIRLS SAID HE ARE GUARDED AND WATCHED OVER BESIDES MEN DO NOT AS A RULE PURSUE THEM MUCH
WOMEN FOR THE MOST PART HAVE BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED BY THEIR HUSBANDS THAT THEY HAVE NOT COURAGE ENOUGH TO BEGIN AGAIN WITH SOMEBODY ELSE I MYSELF HAVE BEEN MET BY THIS OBSTACLE SEVERAL TIMES IN MY ATTEMPTS AT SEDUCTION
BEING NOW ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH MINISTERS AND WITH THE PRESIDENT EVELINE CONTINUED TO WEAR HER ARISTOCRATIC AND PIOUS AFFECTATIONS AND THESE WON FOR HER THE SYMPATHY OF THE CHIEF PERSONAGES IN THE ANTI CLERICAL AND DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
AND IN PARTICULAR AT A GARDEN PARTY WHICH ALTHOUGH GIVEN BY A MINISTER WAS REGARDED AS REALLY FASHIONABLE AND GAINED ITS FIRST SUCCESS IN SOCIETY CIRCLES FOR THE REPUBLIC
AND WE SHOULD ESTABLISH GARAGES UPON THEM AND FOOT BRIDGES OVER THEM AND SO CREATE ORDER AND HARMONY AMONG THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION OF THE FUTURE THAT IS THE WISH OF EVERY GOOD CITIZEN
AFTER HAVING HAD THE JOY OF CONTEMPLATING IT CLOSELY FOR THREE HOURS I FELT MYSELF SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED INTO A LITTLE CHILD WHILE MY CAB WAS TAKING ME THROUGH TRAFALGAR SQUARE I KEPT LAUGHING AND PRATTLING AND SHAKING MY SPECTACLE CASE AS IF IT WERE A RATTLE
THE PENGUINS TO DAY WORSHIP THE MOTORS THAT CRUSH THEM WITHOUT A DOUBT THE FUTURE BELONGS TO THE METAL BEAST WE ARE NO MORE LIKELY TO GO BACK TO CABS THAN WE ARE TO GO BACK TO THE DILIGENCE AND THE LONG MARTYRDOM OF THE HORSE WILL COME TO AN END THE MOTOR
THE ANGELS WILL AFFECT AN EQUIVOCAL AMBIGUOUS MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY WHICH WILL TROUBLE HEARTS WHAT DESIRE FOR HEAVEN WILL THESE REPRESENTATIONS IMPART NONE
WITH HIS BROW CLASPED IN HIS HANDS HE EXCLAIMED
THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO OR EVEN LONGER AT THAT PERIOD OF INDIGENCE AND SIMPLICITY THE MUNICIPAL MUSEUMS THOUGH USUALLY KEPT SHUT WERE ALWAYS OPENED TO FOREIGNERS ONE EVENING AN OLD WOMAN WITH A CANDLE SHOWED ME FOR HALF A LIRA
HE NOTICED IN THE STUDIO A FRESHLY PAINTED MADONNA WHICH ALTHOUGH SEVERE AND RIGID NEVERTHELESS BY A CERTAIN EXACTNESS IN THE PROPORTIONS AND A DEVILISH MINGLING OF LIGHT AND SHADE ASSUMED AN APPEARANCE OF RELIEF AND LIFE
IN THE MIDST OF THE MUSES WEARING LIGHT TUNICS HE SAW VENUSES LYING UNDER SHADY MYRTLES AND THE DANAE EXPOSING THEIR CHARMING SIDES TO THE GOLDEN RAIN HE SAW PICTURES OF JESUS UNDER THE PILLAR'S OF THE TEMPLE
LIKE THE IDOLS OF THE ROMANS THERE WILL BE A SACRED ART AND A PROFANE ART AND THE SACRED ART WILL NOT BE LESS PROFANE THAN THE OTHER
COLOURING AND DESIGN CONSPIRE TO PRODUCE AN IDEAL AND MYSTICAL IMPRESSION THE VERMILION OF THE CHEEKS DOES NOT RECALL THE NATURAL APPEARANCE OF THE SKIN IT RATHER SEEMS AS IF THE OLD MASTER HAS APPLIED THE ROSES OF PARADISE TO THE FACES OF THE MOTHER
THAT THESE UNITED COLONIES ARE AND OF RIGHT OUGHT TO BE FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES THAT THEY ARE ABSOLVED FROM ALL ALLEGIANCE TO THE BRITISH CROWN
THE SHOP BOYS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD LONG BEEN IN THE HABIT OF BRANDING NOAH IN THE PUBLIC STREETS WITH THE IGNOMINIOUS EPITHETS OF LEATHERS CHARITY AND THE LIKE AND NOAH HAD BOURNE THEM WITHOUT REPLY
WITH THIS MISTER CLAYPOLE ADMINISTERED A KICK TO OLIVER AND ENTERED THE SHOP WITH A DIGNIFIED AIR WHICH DID HIM GREAT CREDIT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A LARGE HEADED SMALL EYED YOUTH OF LUMBERING MAKE AND HEAVY COUNTENANCE
THE SOONER THIS JOB IS DONE THE BETTER NOAH LOOK AFTER THE SHOP OLIVER PUT ON YOUR CAP AND COME WITH ME OLIVER OBEYED AND FOLLOWED HIS MASTER ON HIS PROFESSIONAL MISSION
AS THEIR NEGLECTED APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENTLY DENOTED WITHOUT THE CONCURRENT TESTIMONY AFFORDED BY THE SQUALID LOOKS OF THE FEW MEN AND WOMEN WHO WITH FOLDED ARMS AND BODIES HALF DOUBLED OCCASIONALLY SKULKED ALONG
AT THIS THE CHARITY BOY LOOKED MONSTROUS FIERCE AND SAID THAT OLIVER WOULD WANT ONE BEFORE LONG IF HE CUT JOKES WITH HIS SUPERIORS IN THAT WAY YER DON'T KNOW WHO I AM I SUPPOSE WORK'US SAID THE CHARITY BOY IN CONTINUATION
WE HAVE REMINDED THEM OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EMIGRATION AND SETTLEMENT HERE WE HAVE APPEALED TO THEIR NATIVE JUSTICE AND MAGNANIMITY AND WE HAVE CONJURED THEM BY THE TIES OF OUR COMMON KINDRED TO DISAVOW THESE USURPATIONS
BY DECLARING US OUT OF HIS PROTECTION AND WAGING WAR AGAINST US HE HAS PLUNDERED OUR SEAS RAVAGED OUR COASTS BURNT OUR TOWNS AND DESTROYED THE LIVES OF OUR PEOPLE HE IS AT THIS TIME
OLIVER HAD BEEN TOO OFTEN SUBJECTED TO THE PROCESS TO WHICH THE VERY EXPRESSIVE MONOSYLLABLE JUST RECORDED BEARS REFERENCE TO ENTERTAIN THE SMALLEST DOUBT THAT THE OWNER OF THE VOICE WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE
IMPRESSED WITH THE BELIEF THAT THE UNKNOWN WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM THROUGH THE KEY HOLE HAD WALKED A FEW PACES OFF TO WARM HIMSELF FOR NOBODY DID HE SEE BUT A BIG CHARITY BOY SITTING ON A POST IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE EATING A SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER
WERE TAKING THEIR SUPPER IN THE LITTLE BACK PARLOUR WHEN MISTER SOWERBERRY AFTER SEVERAL DEFERENTIAL GLANCES AT HIS WIFE SAID MY DEAR HE WAS GOING TO SAY MORE BUT MISSUS SOWERBERRY LOOKING UP WITH A PECULIARLY UNPROPITIOUS ASPECT
REPLIED OLIVER WITH CONSIDERABLE HESITATION NOT VERY MUCH SIR
HE HAS EXCITED DOMESTIC INSURRECTIONS AMONGST US AND HAS ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ON THE INHABITANTS OF OUR FRONTIERS THE MERCILESS INDIAN SAVAGES
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS THE NIGHTLY HAUNTS OF SOME HOUSELESS WRETCHES FOR MANY OF THE ROUGH BOARDS WHICH SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF DOOR AND WINDOW WERE WRENCHED FROM THEIR POSITIONS TO AFFORD AN APERTURE WIDE ENOUGH
DESCENDING FROM THE TOP OF THE POST MEANWHILE WITH EDIFYING GRAVITY NO SIR REJOINED OLIVER I'M MISTER NOAH CLAYPOLE SAID THE CHARITY BOY AND YOU'RE UNDER ME TAKE DOWN THE SHUTTERS YER IDLE YOUNG RUFFIAN
NEVER DID SIR EJACULATED THE BEADLE NO NOR NOBODY NEVER DID BUT NOW SHE'S DEAD WE'VE GOT TO BURY HER AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION AND THE SOONER IT'S DONE THE BETTER
FOR TRANSPORTING US BEYOND SEAS TO BE TRIED FOR PRETENDED OFFENCES FOR ABOLISHING THE FREE SYSTEM OF ENGLISH LAWS IN A NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE ESTABLISHING THEREIN AN ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT
HAVE RETURNED TO THE PEOPLE AT LARGE FOR THEIR EXERCISE THE STATE REMAINING IN THE MEAN TIME EXPOSED TO ALL THE DANGERS OF INVASION FROM WITHOUT AND CONVULSIONS WITHIN
WHO HAVING CONSOLED HIM WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HE'D CATCH IT CONDESCENDED TO HELP HIM MISTER SOWERBERRY CAME DOWN SOON AFTER SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MISSUS SOWERBERRY APPEARED OLIVER HAVING CAUGHT IT IN FULFILMENT OF NOAH'S PREDICTION
AS HE SAT SHIVERING ON THE BOX IN THE COLDEST CORNER OF THE ROOM AND ATE THE STALE PIECES WHICH HAD BEEN SPECIALLY RESERVED FOR HIM
THE MAN WHO HAD NEVER ONCE MOVED SINCE HE HAD TAKEN HIS STATION BY THE GRAVE SIDE STARTED RAISED HIS HEAD STARED AT THE PERSON WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM
MISSUS SOWERBERRY WHO HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TASTE IN THE UNDERTAKING WAY WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE NOVELTY OF THIS IDEA
SHE COULDN'T EVEN SEE HER CHILDREN'S FACES THOUGH WE HEARD HER GASPING OUT THEIR NAMES
AND OF CONSANGUINITY WE MUST THEREFORE ACQUIESCE IN THE NECESSITY WHICH DENOUNCES OUR SEPARATION AND HOLD THEM AS WE HOLD THE REST OF MANKIND ENEMIES IN WAR IN PEACE FRIENDS
IT AT ONCE REDUCED MISTER SOWERBERRY TO BEGGING AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT MISSUS SOWERBERRY WAS MOST CURIOUS TO HEAR AFTER A SHORT DURATION THE PERMISSION WAS MOST GRACIOUSLY CONCEDED
AND HOW IMPARTIALLY THE SAME AMIABLE QUALITIES ARE DEVELOPED IN THE FINEST LORD AND THE DIRTIEST CHARITY BOY OLIVER HAD BEEN SOJOURNING AT THE UNDERTAKER'S SOME THREE WEEKS OR A MONTH MISTER AND MISSUS SOWERBERRY THE SHOP BEING SHUT UP
FOR OPPOSING WITH MANLY FIRMNESS HIS INVASIONS ON THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE HE HAS REFUSED FOR A LONG TIME AFTER SUCH DISSOLUTIONS TO CAUSE OTHERS TO BE ELECTED
AT LENGTH AFTER A LAPSE OF SOMETHING MORE THAN AN HOUR MISTER BUMBLE AND SOWERBERRY AND THE CLERK WERE SEEN RUNNING TOWARDS THE GRAVE
BUMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE REPLIED OBSTINATE PEOPLE MISTER SOWERBERRY VERY OBSTINATE PROUD TOO I'M AFRAID SIR
DIFFICULT TASK FOR THE GRAVE WAS SO FULL THAT THE UPPERMOST COFFIN WAS WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SURFACE
BECAUSE WE WERE WORSE OFF AFTER WE HAD WASHED OUR CLOTHES THAN WE WERE BEFORE BEFORE WE HAD WASHED THEM THEY HAD BEEN VERY VERY DIRTY IT IS TRUE BUT THEY WERE JUST WEARABLE AFTER WE HAD WASHED THEM WELL
THE GREATEST NUMBER OF FISH HE EVER CAUGHT IN ONE DAY WAS THREE AND YOU CAN'T ADD TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TO THREE AT LEAST NOT IN FISH SO HE INCREASED HIS PERCENTAGE TO THIRTY THREE AND A THIRD
WELL I HAD A HAUL ON TUESDAY EVENING THAT IT'S NOT MUCH GOOD MY TELLING ANYBODY ABOUT OH WHY'S THAT THEY ASK BECAUSE I DON'T EXPECT ANYBODY WOULD BELIEVE ME IF I DID REPLIES THE OLD FELLOW CALMLY
IN FACT AT FIRST GLANCE I THOUGHT IT WAS A COD AH SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF MY GAZE FINE FELLOW THAT AIN'T HE QUITE UNCOMMON I MURMURED
LAST MONDAY I LANDED A GUDGEON WEIGHING EIGHTEEN POUNDS AND MEASURING THREE FEET FROM THE TIP TO THE TAIL THERE IS NO ART NO SKILL REQUIRED FOR THAT SORT OF THING IT SHOWS PLUCK BUT THAT IS ALL
WE PAID THE BILL WITHOUT A MURMUR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF STREATLEY AND GORING IS A GREAT FISHING CENTRE THERE IS SOME EXCELLENT FISHING TO BE HAD HERE
AND GEORGE ASKED THE OLD MAN HOW MUCH HE THOUGHT IT WEIGHED EIGHTEEN POUNDS SIX OUNCES SAID OUR FRIEND RISING AND TAKING DOWN HIS COAT YES HE CONTINUED IT WUR SIXTEEN YEAR AGO COME THE THIRD O NEXT MONTH THAT I LANDED HIM
JACK AND PERCH MAY BE ABOUT THERE INDEED I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY ARE YOU CAN SEE THEM THERE IN SHOALS WHEN YOU ARE OUT FOR A WALK ALONG THE BANKS
YOU HAVEN'T INJURED THE FISH HAVE YOU I CRIED IN ALARM RUSHING UP I HOPE NOT SAID GEORGE RISING CAUTIOUSLY AND LOOKING ABOUT BUT HE HAD
CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH A POT OF BEER IN HIS HAND AND HE ALSO LOOKED AT THE FISH GOOD SIZED TROUT THAT SAID GEORGE TURNING ROUND TO HIM AH YOU MAY WELL SAY THAT SIR REPLIED THE MAN
WOULD REQUIRE MORE PLAY OF FANCY MORE POWER OF INVENTION THAN I APPEARED TO POSSESS SOME PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE A GOOD FISHERMAN IS THE ABILITY TO TELL LIES EASILY AND WITHOUT BLUSHING
THAT TROUT LAY SHATTERED INTO A THOUSAND FRAGMENTS I SAY A THOUSAND BUT THEY MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN NINE HUNDRED I DID NOT COUNT THEM
A GOOD STATION FOR FISHING AND FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THE DISTRICT I AM QUITE PREPARED TO BEAR OUT THIS STATEMENT THERE IS NO SPOT IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN GET MORE FISHING
AND GEORGE CLUTCHED WILDLY AT THE TROUT CASE TO SAVE HIMSELF
BUT THIS IS A MISTAKE MERE BALD FABRICATION IS USELESS THE VERIEST TYRO CAN MANAGE THAT IT IS IN THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL DETAIL THE EMBELLISHING TOUCHES OF PROBABILITY
WE THOUGHT IT STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE THAT A STUFFED TROUT SHOULD BREAK UP INTO LITTLE PIECES LIKE THAT AND SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE IF IT HAD BEEN A STUFFED TROUT BUT IT WAS NOT
IT REALLY WAS A MOST ASTONISHING TROUT THE MORE WE LOOKED AT IT THE MORE WE MARVELLED AT IT IT EXCITED GEORGE SO MUCH THAT HE CLIMBED UP ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR TO GET A BETTER VIEW OF IT AND THEN THE CHAIR SLIPPED
SOME FISHERMEN COME HERE AND FISH FOR A DAY AND OTHERS STOP AND FISH FOR A MONTH
YES THEY ARE THE SORT TO GIVE IT ME TO PUT UP IN MY PARLOUR IF THEY HAD CAUGHT IT THEY ARE HA HA HA AND THEN HE TOLD US THE REAL HISTORY OF THE FISH IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD CAUGHT IT HIMSELF YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS QUITE A LAD
BECAUSE AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT I DID CATCH IT BUT FANCY YOUR GUESSING IT LIKE THAT DEAR ME IT'S REALLY A MOST REMARKABLE THING AND THEN HE WENT ON AND TOLD US HOW IT HAD TAKEN HIM HALF AN HOUR TO LAND IT
IT WILL BE ALL THE SAME THE ANGLER'S GUIDE TO THE THAMES SAYS THAT JACK AND PERCH ARE ALSO TO BE HAD ABOUT HERE BUT THERE THE ANGLER'S GUIDE IS WRONG
AND THEN HE GREW DISSATISFIED WITH IT NOBODY BELIEVED HIM WHEN HE TOLD THEM THAT HE ONLY DOUBLED AND HE THEREFORE GAINED NO CREDIT THAT WAY WHATEVER WHILE HIS MODERATION PUT HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE AMONG THE OTHER ANGLERS
AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK LATELY OF ITS BEING MADE USE OF BY THE ANGLING FRATERNITY IN GENERAL INDEED THE COMMITTEE OF THE THAMES ANGLER'S ASSOCIATION DID RECOMMEND ITS ADOPTION ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SOME OF THE OLDER MEMBERS OPPOSED IT
THE RIVER ABOUNDS IN PIKE ROACH DACE GUDGEON AND EELS JUST HERE AND YOU CAN SIT AND FISH FOR THEM ALL DAY SOME PEOPLE DO THEY NEVER CATCH THEM
NO WE TOLD HIM WE WERE STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AH SAID THE CARRIER THEN OF COURSE HOW SHOULD YOU IT WAS NEARLY FIVE YEARS AGO THAT I CAUGHT THAT TROUT OH WAS IT YOU WHO CAUGHT IT THEN SAID I
THEY SAID THEY WOULD CONSIDER THE IDEA IF THE NUMBER WERE DOUBLED AND EACH FISH COUNTED AS TWENTY IF EVER YOU HAVE AN EVENING TO SPARE UP THE RIVER I SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO DROP INTO ONE OF THE LITTLE VILLAGE INNS AND TAKE A SEAT IN THE TAP ROOM
THE GENERAL AIR OF SCRUPULOUS ALMOST OF PEDANTIC VERACITY THAT THE EXPERIENCED ANGLER IS SEEN ANYBODY CAN COME IN AND SAY OH I CAUGHT FIFTEEN DOZEN PERCH YESTERDAY EVENING OR
AND OUT HE WENT AND LEFT US ALONE WE COULD NOT TAKE OUR EYES OFF THE FISH AFTER THAT IT REALLY WAS A REMARKABLY FINE FISH WE WERE STILL LOOKING AT IT WHEN THE LOCAL CARRIER WHO HAD JUST STOPPED AT THE INN
UPON THIS SENATOR DOUGLAS HOLDS THE AFFIRMATIVE AND REPUBLICANS THE NEGATIVE THIS AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL FORM AN ISSUE AND THIS ISSUE THIS QUESTION IS PRECISELY WHAT THE TEXT DECLARES OUR FATHERS UNDERSTOOD
IT WILL BE IN THE MODE OF PRESENTING THE FACTS AND THE INFERENCES AND OBSERVATIONS FOLLOWING THAT PRESENTATION IN HIS SPEECH LAST AUTUMN AT COLUMBUS OHIO AS REPORTED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES SENATOR DOUGLAS SAID OUR FATHERS
AND WE COMMEND IT TO YOU TOGETHER WITH HIS EXAMPLE POINTING TO THE RIGHT APPLICATION OF IT BUT YOU SAY YOU ARE CONSERVATIVE EMINENTLY CONSERVATIVE WHILE WE ARE REVOLUTIONARY DESTRUCTIVE OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT
HIS HOPE THAT WE SHOULD AT SOME TIME HAVE A CONFEDERACY OF FREE STATES BEARING THIS IN MIND AND SEEING THAT SECTIONALISM HAS SINCE ARISEN UPON THIS SAME SUBJECT IS THAT WARNING A WEAPON IN YOUR HANDS AGAINST US
BUT TO BE TOLERATED AND PROTECTED ONLY BECAUSE OF AND SO FAR AS ITS ACTUAL PRESENCE AMONG US MAKES THAT TOLERATION AND PROTECTION A NECESSITY LET ALL THE GUARANTIES THOSE FATHERS GAVE IT BE NOT GRUDGINGLY
WE SHOULD THEREBY CEASE TO BE SECTIONAL YOU CANNOT ESCAPE THIS CONCLUSION AND YET ARE YOU WILLING TO ABIDE BY IT IF YOU ARE YOU WILL PROBABLY SOON FIND THAT WE HAVE CEASED TO BE SECTIONAL
NO LINE DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY NOR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION WAS VIOLATED BY CONGRESS PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY WHILE MISTER PINCKNEY
SOME OF YOU ARE FOR REVIVING THE FOREIGN SLAVE TRADE SOME FOR A CONGRESSIONAL SLAVE CODE FOR THE TERRITORIES SOME FOR CONGRESS FORBIDDING THE TERRITORIES TO PROHIBIT SLAVERY WITHIN THEIR LIMITS SOME FOR MAINTAINING SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORIES THROUGH THE JUDICIARY
AS NO BETTER THAN OUTLAWS YOU WILL GRANT A HEARING TO PIRATES OR MURDERERS BUT NOTHING LIKE IT TO BLACK REPUBLICANS IN ALL YOUR CONTENTIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER EACH OF YOU DEEMS AN UNCONDITIONAL CONDEMNATION OF BLACK REPUBLICANISM
PROPERLY FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY THE OTHER OF THE FOUR JAMES MC HENRY VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION SHOWING THAT FOR SOME CAUSE HE THOUGHT IT IMPROPER TO VOTE FOR IT
IF WE SHOULD LOOK INTO THEIR ACTS AND DECLARATIONS ON THOSE OTHER PHASES AS THE FOREIGN SLAVE TRADE AND THE MORALITY AND POLICY OF SLAVERY GENERALLY IT WOULD APPEAR TO US THAT ON THE DIRECT QUESTION OF FEDERAL CONTROL OF SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORIES
THE EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS ARE EVERYWHERE IN PARCELS BUT THERE NEITHER ARE NOR CAN BE SUPPLIED THE INDISPENSABLE CONNECTING TRAINS MUCH IS SAID BY SOUTHERN PEOPLE ABOUT THE AFFECTION OF SLAVES FOR THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES
BUT FULLY AND FAIRLY MAINTAINED FOR THIS REPUBLICANS CONTEND AND WITH THIS SO FAR AS I KNOW OR BELIEVE THEY WILL BE CONTENT AND NOW IF THEY WOULD LISTEN AS I SUPPOSE THEY WILL NOT
SUCH UNQUESTIONABLY WAS THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND THE TEXT AFFIRMS THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION BETTER THAN WE
I HAVE PURPOSELY OMITTED WHATEVER UNDERSTANDING MAY HAVE BEEN MANIFESTED BY ANY PERSON HOWEVER DISTINGUISHED OTHER THAN THE THIRTY NINE FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND FOR THE SAME REASON
CANNOT STAND AND MOST SURELY NOT IN A CASE WHEREOF WE OURSELVES DECLARE THEY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION BETTER THAN WE IF ANY MAN AT THIS DAY SINCERELY BELIEVES THAT PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY
BRAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DECLARING THAT IN HIS OPINION HE UNDERSTANDS THEIR PRINCIPLES BETTER THAN THEY DID THEMSELVES AND ESPECIALLY SHOULD HE NOT SHIRK THAT RESPONSIBILITY BY ASSERTING THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION JUST AS WELL
PROPERLY FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORY THIS TIME THE PROHIBITION BECAME A LAW BEING PART OF WHAT IS NOW WELL KNOWN AS THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN THE QUESTION OF FEDERAL CONTROL OF SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORIES
AND ARE JUSTLY OPPOSED AND DENOUNCED AS SUCH MEET US THEN ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OUR PRINCIPLE PUT IN PRACTICE WOULD WRONG YOUR SECTION
WHETHER YOUR CLAIM OF CONSERVATISM FOR YOURSELVES AND YOUR CHARGE OF DESTRUCTIVENESS AGAINST US ARE BASED ON THE MOST CLEAR AND STABLE FOUNDATIONS AGAIN YOU SAY WE HAVE MADE THE SLAVERY QUESTION MORE PROMINENT THAN IT FORMERLY WAS
AS TO MAKE THEM GUILTY OF GROSS POLITICAL IMPROPRIETY AND WILFUL PERJURY IF IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION BETWEEN LOCAL AND FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES AND SWORN TO SUPPORT
AND A PART OF IT AT LEAST IS TRUE A PLOT FOR AN UPRISING COULD SCARCELY BE DEVISED AND COMMUNICATED TO TWENTY INDIVIDUALS BEFORE SOME ONE OF THEM TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A FAVORITE MASTER OR MISTRESS WOULD DIVULGE IT
CONGRESS ORGANIZED THE TERRITORY OF MISSISSIPPI IN THE ACT OF ORGANIZATION THEY PROHIBITED THE BRINGING OF SLAVES INTO THE TERRITORY FROM ANY PLACE WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES BY FINE AND GIVING FREEDOM TO SLAVES SO BROUGHT
THE CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATION HAD BEFORE THEM THE QUESTION OF PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN THAT TERRITORY AND FOUR OF THE THIRTY NINE WHO AFTERWARD FRAMED THE CONSTITUTION WERE IN THAT CONGRESS AND VOTED ON THAT QUESTION
SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY BEFORE THE CONVENTION WHICH FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND HENCE IT IS NOT RECORDED THAT THE THIRTY NINE OR ANY OF THEM WHILE ENGAGED ON THAT INSTRUMENT EXPRESSED ANY OPINION ON THAT PRECISE QUESTION
THAT FAULT IS PRIMARILY YOURS
OR SOME PROVISION OR PRINCIPLE OF THE CONSTITUTION STOOD IN THE WAY OR THEY MAY WITHOUT ANY SUCH QUESTION HAVE VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION ON WHAT APPEARED TO THEM TO BE SUFFICIENT GROUNDS OF EXPEDIENCY
TO BE WELL PAID FOR HIS SERVICES AND SUCCEEDED IN ACQUIRING PARTLY BY THE SALE OF HIS INFLUENCE PARTLY BY GAMBLING AND PARTLY BY PIMPING AN ESTATE OF THREE THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FOR UNDER AN OUTWARD SHOW OF LEVITY PROFUSION
MIGHT PLACE A PRINCE OF HIS FAMILY ON THE THRONE OF POLAND MIGHT BE SOLE MASTER OF EUROPE FROM THE SCYTHIAN DESERTS TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND OF AMERICA FROM REGIONS NORTH OF THE TROPIC OF CANCER
WHICH ELAPSED BETWEEN THE DEATH OF CHARLES AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE VICEROYALTY OF CLARENDON WHEN THE NEW LORD LIEUTENANT WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE LONDON FOR DUBLIN THE GENERAL WAS SUMMONED FROM DUBLIN TO LONDON DICK TALBOT
TO BE LED ROUND WESTMINSTER HALL WITH AN INSCRIPTION DECLARING HIS INFAMY OVER HIS HEAD TO BE PILLORIED AGAIN IN FRONT OF THE ROYAL EXCHANGE TO BE WHIPPED FROM ALDGATE TO NEWGATE AND AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO DAYS
AND WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THESE WORDS BY THE COUNT OF AVAUX POSITIVELY REFUSED EITHER TO RETRACT THEM OR TO EXPLAIN THEM AWAY
FOR THE CONSUMMATE HYPOCRITE IS NOT HE WHO CONCEALS VICE BEHIND THE SEMBLANCE OF VIRTUE BUT HE WHO MAKES THE VICE WHICH HE HAS NO OBJECTION TO SHOW A STALKING HORSE TO COVER DARKER AND MORE PROFITABLE VICE
A PERSON WHO COUNTED THE STRIPES ON THE SECOND DAY SAID THAT THEY WERE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED THE BAD MAN ESCAPED WITH LIFE BUT SO NARROWLY THAT HIS IGNORANT AND BIGOTED ADMIRERS THOUGHT HIS RECOVERY MIRACULOUS
HE PINED FOR THE FAMILIAR HOUSE IN THE WOOD AT THE HAGUE AND NEVER WAS SO HAPPY AS WHEN HE COULD QUIT THE MAGNIFICENCE OF WINDSOR FOR HIS FAR HUMBLER SEAT AT LOO DURING HIS SPLENDID BANISHMENT
THEY CONVERSED EVERY DAY LONG AND FREELY ABOUT THE STATE OF THE SHIPPING AND THE DOCK YARDS THE RESULT OF THIS INTIMACY WAS AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT THE KEEN AND VIGILANT FRENCHMAN
AND EVEN FOR REPRIMANDS FROM VERSAILLES
ONE OF THESE WAS ROGER PALMER EARL OF CASTELMAINE IN IRELAND AND HUSBAND OF THE DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND HIS TITLE HAD NOTORIOUSLY BEEN PURCHASED BY HIS WIFE'S DISHONOUR AND HIS OWN HIS FORTUNE WAS SMALL HIS TEMPER
WITH THE INSOLENCE OF DESPAIR HE WAS CONVICTED ON BOTH INDICTMENTS HIS OFFENCE THOUGH IN A MORAL LIGHT MURDER OF THE MOST AGGRAVATED KIND WAS IN THE EYE OF THE LAW MERELY A MISDEMEANOUR THE TRIBUNAL HOWEVER
THERE WAS THE STATELY TOMB WHERE SLEPT THE GREAT POLITICIAN WHOSE BLOOD WHOSE NAME WHOSE TEMPERAMENT AND WHOSE GENIUS HE HAD INHERITED
AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO OBTAIN THE QUEEN'S INTERCESSION BUT SHE INDIGNANTLY REFUSED TO SAY A WORD IN FAVOUR OF SUCH A WRETCH AFTER AN INTERVAL OF ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS OATES WAS AGAIN BROUGHT OUT OF HIS DUNGEON HE WAS UNABLE TO STAND
REPRESENTED FRANCE AND WHO TO VIRTUES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS EMINENTLY FRENCH JOINED IN LARGE MEASURE THAT UNQUIET UNSCRUPULOUS AND VAINGLORIOUS AMBITION WHICH HAS REPEATEDLY DRAWN ON FRANCE THE RESENTMENT OF EUROPE
THE WORST FELON COULD ONLY BE HANGED THE JUDGES AS THEY BELIEVED SENTENCED OATES TO BE SCOURGED TO DEATH THAT THE LAW WAS DEFECTIVE IS NOT A SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR DEFECTIVE LAWS SHOULD BE ALTERED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND NOT STRAINED BY THE TRIBUNALS
WHEN HE WAS UNBOUND IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD BORNE AS MUCH AS THE HUMAN FRAME CAN BEAR WITHOUT DISSOLUTION JAMES WAS ENTREATED TO REMIT THE SECOND FLOGGING HIS ANSWER WAS SHORT AND CLEAR HE SHALL GO THROUGH WITH IT IF HE HAS BREATH IN HIS BODY
THAT THE FATHER OF A LARGE FAMILY WOULD RATHER BE BEREAVED OF ALL HIS CHILDREN BY ACCIDENT OR BY DISEASE THAN LOSE ONE OF THEM BY THE HANDS OF THE HANGMAN MURDER BY FALSE TESTIMONY IS THEREFORE THE MOST AGGRAVATED SPECIES OF MURDER
SECURE OF PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT HE MIGHT NOW INDULGE IN THE LUXURY OF REVENGE HIS NATURE WAS NOT PLACABLE AND WHILE STILL A SUBJECT HE HAD SUFFERED SOME INJURIES AND INDIGNITIES
EVEN WHILE THE PRAYER FOR THE DEPARTING WAS READ AT HIS BEDSIDE THAT FEELING WAS ENMITY TO FRANCE AND TO THE MAGNIFICENT KING WHO IN MORE THAN ONE SENSE
AND DOCKYARDS AND HE WAS TO MAKE SOME OVERTURES TO THE HUGUENOT REFUGEES WHO IT WAS SUPPOSED
BY LAYING THE BLAME OF THE ACCIDENT ON HER MONKEY THESE STORIES WHICH IF THEY HAD BEEN TRUE WOULD NEVER HAVE PASSED THE LIPS OF ANY BUT THE BASEST OF MANKIND WERE PURE INVENTIONS TALBOT WAS SOON FORCED TO OWN THAT THEY WERE SO
WAS TO HIM WHAT THE ROMAN REPUBLIC WAS TO HANNIBAL WHAT THE OTTOMAN POWER WAS TO SCANDERBEG
THAT THEY WOULD THANKFULLY ACCEPT ALMOST ANY TERMS OF RECONCILIATION THE NEW ENVOY'S ORIGIN WAS PLEBEIAN HIS STATURE WAS DWARFISH HIS COUNTENANCE WAS LUDICROUSLY UGLY
HAPPILY FOR HIM HE WAS NOT PUT TO THE BAR TILL THE FIRST BURST OF POPULAR RAGE HAD SPENT ITSELF AND TILL THE CREDIT OF THE FALSE WITNESSES HAD BEEN BLOWN UPON HE HAD THEREFORE ESCAPED
OCCUPIED ORANGE DISMANTLED THE FORTIFICATIONS AND CONFISCATED THE REVENUES WILLIAM DECLARED ALOUD AT HIS TABLE BEFORE MANY PERSONS THAT HE WOULD MAKE THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING REPENT THE OUTRAGE
NEWCASTLE WAS LIGHTED UP WITH GREAT PILES OF COAL
HE FOUGHT ONE OF THE MOST BLOODY AND OBSTINATE BATTLES OF THAT AGE FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE TREATY OF NIMEGUEN WAS SIGNED
AND HIS ACCENT WAS THAT OF HIS NATIVE GASCONY BUT HIS STRONG SENSE HIS KEEN PENETRATION AND HIS LIVELY WIT EMINENTLY QUALIFIED HIM FOR HIS POST
THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY COMPETENT TO INFLICT WHIPPING NOR HAD THE LAW ASSIGNED A LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF STRIPES BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW CLEARLY WAS THAT NO MISDEMEANOUR SHOULD BE PUNISHED MORE SEVERELY THAN THE MOST ATROCIOUS FELONIES
DID HE AT ALL KNOW WHERE HE WANTED TO LIVE TIBBY DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE DID KNOW DID HE AT ALL KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO DO HE WAS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN BUT WHEN PRESSED REMARKED THAT HE SHOULD PREFER TO BE QUITE FREE OF ANY PROFESSION
TO BE LIKE MUSIC IT'S OBLIGED TO REMIND HER OF A SYMPHONIC POEM
OH YES OR ILFRACOMBE AND SWANAGE AND TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND SURBITON AND BEDFORD THERE ON NO ACCOUNT LONDON THEN
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SPARED HERSELF ALL THE TROUBLE OF URGING A REMOVAL WHICH LADY SUSAN HAD DOUBTLESS RESOLVED ON FROM THE FIRST FREDERICA'S VISIT WAS NOMINALLY FOR SIX WEEKS BUT HER MOTHER THOUGH INVITING HER TO RETURN IN ONE OR TWO AFFECTIONATE LETTERS
THE LEAVES WERE FALLING BY MIDSUMMER THE SUN SHONE THROUGH DIRT WITH AN ADMIRED OBSCURITY TO SPEAK AGAINST LONDON IS NO LONGER FASHIONABLE THE EARTH AS AN ARTISTIC CULT HAS HAD ITS DAY
WAS THERE SUCH A THING AS STETTININITY MARGARET SWEPT ON PEOPLE AT STETTIN DROP THINGS INTO BOATS OUT OF OVERHANGING WAREHOUSES
NO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR NINNIES THEN THEY WERE MEN WHO HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO SAID HIS SISTER FEELING THAT SHE WAS ENTITLED TO SCORE THIS POINT SO TAKE WARNING YOU MUST WORK OR ELSE YOU MUST PRETEND TO WORK WHICH IS WHAT I DO
ABOVE ALL DISORDERS IN THE WORLD SHE MOST DREADED THE INFLUENZA FOR HER DAUGHTER'S CONSTITUTION FREDERICA RETURNED TO CHURCHHILL WITH HER UNCLE AND AUNT AND THREE WEEKS AFTERWARDS LADY SUSAN ANNOUNCED HER BEING MARRIED TO SIR JAMES MARTIN
CONCLUSION THIS CORRESPONDENCE BY A MEETING BETWEEN SOME OF THE PARTIES AND A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE OTHERS COULD NOT TO THE GREAT DETRIMENT OF THE POST OFFICE REVENUE BE CONTINUED ANY LONGER
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I MUST BE GETTING BACK TO MY OVERHANGING WAREHOUSE SAID THE MAN THEY'VE TURNED DISGRACEFULLY STRICT
THREE MONTHS MIGHT HAVE DONE IT IN GENERAL BUT REGINALD'S FEELINGS WERE NO LESS LASTING THAN LIVELY WHETHER LADY SUSAN WAS OR WAS NOT HAPPY IN HER SECOND CHOICE I DO NOT SEE HOW IT CAN EVER BE ASCERTAINED
TIME SUFFERED NO INCONVENIENCE BUT ALL NIGHT AND ALL THIS MORNING HER APPREHENSIONS GREW BREAKFAST DIDN'T SEEM THE SAME NO NO MORE DID LUNCH AND SO SHE STROLLED UP TO TWO WICKHAM PLACE AS BEING THE MOST LIKELY PLACE FOR THE MISSING
ROUSE UP THAT'S MY HEARTY JOHN SAID THESE LATTER WORDS OUTSIDE THE DOOR WHITHER HE HAD HURRIED WITH THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND MISS SLOWBOY CONSCIOUS OF SOME MYSTERIOUS REFERENCE TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND CONNECTING IN HER MYSTIFIED IMAGINATION
FOR THE FORMER SOON PERCEIVED BY THE STYLE OF FREDERICA'S LETTERS THAT THEY WERE WRITTEN UNDER HER MOTHER'S INSPECTION AND THEREFORE DEFERRING ALL PARTICULAR ENQUIRY TILL SHE COULD MAKE IT PERSONALLY IN LONDON CEASED WRITING MINUTELY
LADY SUSAN WAS UNABLE TO EXPRESS HER SENSE OF SUCH KINDNESS YET KNEW NOT FROM A VARIETY OF REASONS HOW TO PART WITH HER DAUGHTER AND AS THOUGH HER OWN PLANS WERE NOT YET WHOLLY FIXED
OUT TO HIS DUTY DUTY ALWAYS ELICITED A GROAN HE DOESN'T WANT THE MONEY IT IS WORK HE WANTS THOUGH IT IS BEASTLY WORK DULL COUNTRY DISHONEST NATIVES AN ETERNAL FIDGET OVER FRESH WATER AND FOOD
CONCLUDED BY DECLINING ENTIRELY TO PROFIT BY SUCH UNEXAMPLED ATTENTION MISSUS VERNON PERSEVERED HOWEVER IN THE OFFER OF IT AND THOUGH LADY SUSAN CONTINUED TO RESIST HER RESISTANCE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS SEEMED
SHE INSTINCTIVELY MADE A CHARGE OR BUTT AT HIM WITH THE ONLY OFFENSIVE INSTRUMENT WITHIN HER REACH THIS INSTRUMENT HAPPENING TO BE THE BABY GREAT COMMOTION AND ALARM ENSUED WHICH THE SAGACITY OF BOXER RATHER TENDED TO INCREASE
AND A CHILL FELL ON THE CONVERSATION OH MISSUS WILCOX SAY SOMETHING NICER THAN THAT IT'S SUCH A SNUB TO BE TOLD YOU PUT THINGS SPLENDIDLY I DO NOT MEAN IT AS A SNUB
BEFORE HE COULD HAVE READ TWO LINES HE AGAIN INTERRUPTED HIMSELF TO SAY BABY YOURS
VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE TO THE STATE COULD BE DERIVED FROM THE EPISTOLARY INTERCOURSE OF MISSUS VERNON AND HER NIECE
SHE WAS PROPORTIONABLY MORE ANXIOUS TO GET FREDERICA REMOVED FROM SUCH A MOTHER AND PLACED UNDER HER OWN CARE AND THOUGH WITH LITTLE HOPE OF SUCCESS WAS RESOLVED TO LEAVE NOTHING UNATTEMPTED THAT MIGHT OFFER
AND DARK BRIGHT PENETRATING EYES LOOKED ROUND WITH A SMILE AND SALUTED THE CARRIER'S WIFE BY GRAVELY INCLINING HIS HEAD HIS GARB WAS VERY QUAINT AND ODD A LONG LONG WAY BEHIND THE TIME ITS HUE WAS BROWN ALL OVER
SHE WAS NOT INTELLECTUAL NOR EVEN ALERT AND IT WAS ODD THAT ALL THE SAME SHE SHOULD GIVE THE IDEA OF GREATNESS MARGARET ZIGZAGGING WITH HER FRIENDS OVER THOUGHT AND ART WAS CONSCIOUS OF A PERSONALITY THAT TRANSCENDED THEIR OWN
NICER THAN WOMEN LABOURING UNDER SUCH A DELUSION WHY DO YOU NOT MARRY I SOMETIMES JOLLY WELL THINK I WOULD IF I GOT THE CHANCE HAS NOBODY ARST YOU ONLY NINNIES DO PEOPLE ASK HELEN PLENTIFULLY TELL ME ABOUT THEM
THERE WAS A LITTLE SILENCE ONE ADMITS THAT THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SUFFRAGE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG SAID A GIRL OPPOSITE LEANING FORWARD AND CRUMBLING HER BREAD ARE THEY
SIR JAMES MAY SEEM TO HAVE DRAWN A HARDER LOT THAN MERE FOLLY MERITED I LEAVE HIM THEREFORE TO ALL THE PITY THAT ANYBODY CAN GIVE HIM FOR MYSELF I CONFESS THAT I CAN PITY ONLY MISS MAINWARING WHO
WHILE HER SHALLOWS WASHED MORE WIDELY AGAINST THE HILLS OF SURREY AND OVER THE FIELDS OF HERTFORDSHIRE THIS FAMOUS BUILDING HAD ARISEN THAT WAS DOOMED TODAY WHITEHALL HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED IT WOULD BE THE TURN OF REGENT STREET TOMORROW
HE NEVER STRIKES ME AS PARTICULARLY HAPPY
WHETHER IN THAT SHABBY ROOK'S NEST HE IS ALWAYS PLOTTING WISDOM OR PLOTTING MURDER WHETHER HE WILL GROW UP AFTER SO MUCH SOLITARY BROODING TO ENLIGHTEN HIS FELLOW CREATURES OR TO POISON THEM IS THE ONLY SPECK OF INTEREST THAT PRESENTS ITSELF TO MY PROFESSIONAL VIEW
FOR THE JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS ARE NOT THE JOLLIEST DOGS I HAVE KNOWN BUT I SUPPOSE WE ARE BEST HERE UNTIL THEY TURN US OUT WITH THE OTHER SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS AT MIDNIGHT
ASKED GAFFER HEXAM STOPPING SHORT OR A BODY FOUND WHICH
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND AT ANY TIME RETURNED EUGENE COME TO ME AT MY WORKS AND YOU'LL ALWAYS FIND AN OPENING IN THE LIME KILN THANKEE SIR SAID BOB THIS IS MY PARTNER
DIVESTED OF ITS VARIOUS LIME LIGHTS AND SHADOWS HIS REPORT WENT TO THE EFFECT THAT GAFFER WAS AWAY IN HIS BOAT SUPPOSED TO BE ON HIS OLD LOOK OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED LAST HIGH WATER
OF THIS COMMISSION THE BARE ARMED BOB LEADING THE WAY WITH A FLAMING WISP OF PAPER SO SPEEDILY ACQUITTED HIMSELF THAT COSY SEEMED TO LEAP OUT OF A DARK SLEEP AND EMBRACE THEM WARMLY THE MOMENT THEY PASSED THE LINTELS OF ITS HOSPITABLE DOOR
YET IN SPITE OF HAVING THOSE WEIGHTS ON HIS CONSCIENCE EUGENE WAS SOMEWHAT ENLIVENED BY THE LATE SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF AFFAIRS SO WERE HIS TWO COMPANIONS ITS BEING A CHANGE WAS EVERYTHING THE SUSPENSE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN A NEW LEASE AND TO HAVE BEGUN AFRESH FROM A RECENT DATE
THIS BEING VERY OLD KNOTTED SEAMED AND BEAMED GAVE A LOWERING ASPECT TO THE CHAMBER AND ROOF AND WALLS AND FLOOR ALIKE ABOUNDING IN OLD SMEARS OF FLOUR RED LEAD OR SOME SUCH STAIN WHICH IT HAD PROBABLY ACQUIRED IN WAREHOUSING AND DAMP ALIKE HAD A LOOK OF DECOMPOSITION
IF LAZARUS WAS ONLY HALF AS FAR GONE THAT WAS THE GREATEST OF ALL THE MIRACLES HALLOA CRIED MORTIMER TURNING ROUND WITH HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD YOU SEEM TO BE AT HOME IN THE RED SEA MY YOUNG FRIEND READ OF IT WITH TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL SAID THE BOY
THOROUGHLY USED TO HIM AS HE WAS HE FOUND SOMETHING NEW AND STRAINED IN HIM THAT WAS FOR THE MOMENT PERPLEXING THIS PASSED INTO HIS MIND AND PASSED OUT AGAIN BUT HE REMEMBERED IT AFTERWARDS
HERE I AM SIR AND OUR FRIEND OF THE PERSPIRING BROW IS AT THE FAR CORNER THERE GOOD ANYTHING HAPPENED HIS DAUGHTER HAS BEEN OUT THINKING SHE HEARD HIM CALLING UNLESS IT WAS A SIGN TO HIM TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
IT WAS FORCED UPON ME SAID MORTIMER BECAUSE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT WE WANTED A SOLICITOR IN THE FAMILY AND WE HAVE GOT A PRECIOUS ONE THERE ARE FOUR OF US WITH OUR NAMES PAINTED ON A DOOR POST IN RIGHT OF ONE BLACK HOLE CALLED A SET OF CHAMBERS SAID EUGENE
I HAVE BEEN EUGENE UPON THE HONOURABLE ROLL OF SOLICITORS OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY AND ATTORNEYS AT COMMON LAW FIVE YEARS AND EXCEPT GRATUITOUSLY TAKING INSTRUCTIONS ON AN AVERAGE ONCE A FORTNIGHT FOR THE WILL OF LADY TIPPINS WHO HAS NOTHING TO LEAVE
THIS IS HIM AS HAD A NASTY CUT OVER THE EYE THIS IS THEM TWO YOUNG SISTERS WHAT TIED THEMSELVES TOGETHER WITH A HANDKECHER THIS THE DRUNKEN OLD CHAP IN A PAIR OF LIST SLIPPERS AND A NIGHTCAP WOT HAD OFFERED IT AFTERWARDS COME OUT
THERE WAS A KIND OF FILM OR FLICKER ON HER FACE WHICH AT FIRST HE TOOK TO BE THE FITFUL FIRELIGHT BUT ON A SECOND LOOK HE SAW THAT SHE WAS WEEPING A SAD AND SOLITARY SPECTACLE AS SHOWN HIM BY THE RISING AND THE FALLING OF THE FIRE
WHEN THE BOY SPOKE THESE WORDS SLIGHTINGLY OF HIS SISTER HE TOOK HIM ROUGHLY ENOUGH BY THE CHIN AND TURNED UP HIS FACE TO LOOK AT IT WELL I'M SURE SIR SAID THE BOY RESISTING I HOPE YOU'LL KNOW ME AGAIN
FOR THEY SPOKE AS THEY CROUCHED OR LAY WITHOUT SEEING ONE ANOTHER'S FACES IN REPLY TO THE QUESTION PUT BY MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND SAID EUGENE WHO WAS LYING ON HIS BACK WITH HIS HAT ON HIS FACE
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN RULE BRITANNIA MUTTERED EUGENE BUT IT WASN'T MORTIMER HERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MISTER INSPECTOR TWO BURGLARIES NOW AND A FORGERY
THEY WERE NOT INCLINED TO DISPUTE THIS RECOMMENDATION BUT THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THEY COULD JOIN THE WATCHERS WHEN SO DISPOSED RATHER THAN TRUST TO A VERBAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PLACE WHICH MIGHT MISLEAD
AT THIS TIME OF THEIR WATCH THE WATER CLOSE TO THEM WOULD BE OFTEN AGITATED BY SOME IMPULSION GIVEN IT FROM A DISTANCE
IF THE REAL MAN FEELS AS GUILTY AS I DO SAID EUGENE HE IS REMARKABLY UNCOMFORTABLE INFLUENCE OF SECRECY SUGGESTED LIGHTWOOD
THIS ONE WAS A SAILOR WITH TWO ANCHORS AND A FLAG AND G F T ON HIS ARM LOOK AND SEE IF HE WARN'T QUITE RIGHT THIS ONE WAS THE YOUNG WOMAN IN GREY BOOTS AND HER LINEN MARKED WITH A CROSS LOOK AND SEE IF SHE WARN'T QUITE RIGHT
HERE THE GIRL AROSE WITH HER WORK IN HER HAND AND WENT OUT AT THE DOOR NO MONEY PURSUED MORTIMER BUT THREEPENCE IN ONE OF THE SKIRT POCKETS THREE PENNY PIECES SAID GAFFER HEXAM IN AS MANY SENTENCES
SAID EUGENE WHO KEEPS THE BOOKS AND ATTENDS TO THE WAGES A FAIR DAY'S WAGES FOR A FAIR DAY'S WORK IS EVER MY PARTNER'S MOTTO AND A VERY GOOD UN IT IS GENTLEMEN
HIGH UP AN AWFUL STAIRCASE COMMANDING A BURIAL GROUND AND I HAVE A WHOLE CLERK TO MYSELF AND HE HAS NOTHING TO DO BUT LOOK AT THE BURIAL GROUND AND WHAT HE WILL TURN OUT WHEN ARRIVED AT MATURITY I CANNOT CONCEIVE
HIS MOVEMENTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLANNED TO GAIN FOR HIM IN GETTING BEYOND THEIR REACH TWELVE HOURS ADVANTAGE THE HONEST MAN WHO HAD EXPENDED THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW BECAME UNEASY AND BEGAN TO COMPLAIN WITH BITTERNESS OF THE PRONENESS OF MANKIND TO CHEAT HIM HIM INVESTED WITH THE DIGNITY OF LABOUR
ONLY IT HAD BEEN REGARDED BY MISTER INSPECTOR AS SO UNCOMMONLY SATISFACTORY AND SO FRAUGHT WITH MYSTERIOUS VIRTUES THAT NEITHER OF HIS CLIENTS HAD PRESUMED TO QUESTION IT TWO TAPS WERE NOW HEARD ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW
BUT THERE WERE BELLS TO WINDWARD THAT TOLD THEM OF ITS BEING ONE TWO THREE WITHOUT THAT AID THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN HOW THE NIGHT WORE BY THE FALLING OF THE TIDE RECORDED IN THE APPEARANCE OF AN EVER WIDENING BLACK WET STRIP OF SHORE
PRECISELY MY VIEW OF THE CASE EUGENE BUT SHOW ME A GOOD OPPORTUNITY SHOW ME SOMETHING REALLY WORTH BEING ENERGETIC ABOUT AND I'LL SHOW YOU ENERGY AND SO WILL I SAID EUGENE
TWO OR THREE OLD SCULLS AND OARS STOOD AGAINST THE WALL AND AGAINST ANOTHER PART OF THE WALL WAS A SMALL DRESSER MAKING A SPARE SHOW OF THE COMMONEST ARTICLES OF CROCKERY AND COOKING VESSELS THE ROOF OF THE ROOM WAS NOT PLASTERED BUT WAS FORMED OF THE FLOORING OF THE ROOM ABOVE
GIVE ME SOME MORE OF THAT STUFF
IT WAS AN IMPOSING PORTICOED HOUSE AT WHICH WE STOPPED AND THE HEAVILY CURTAINED WINDOWS GAVE EVERY INDICATION OF WEALTH UPON THE PART OF THIS FORMIDABLE PROFESSOR THE DOOR WAS OPENED BY AN ODD SWARTHY DRIED UP PERSON OF UNCERTAIN AGE
FOR IT IS ONLY WHEN A MAN GOES OUT INTO THE WORLD WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THERE ARE HEROISMS ALL ROUND HIM AND WITH THE DESIRE ALL ALIVE IN HIS HEART TO FOLLOW ANY WHICH MAY COME WITHIN SIGHT OF HIM
HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET WAVING HIS FISTS AND WHEEZING LIKE AN ASTHMATIC
BEFORE I SHOULD FIND SOME DEED WHICH WAS WORTHY OF MY LADY BUT WHO WHO IN ALL THIS WIDE WORLD COULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED THE INCREDIBLE SHAPE WHICH THAT DEED WAS TO TAKE OR THE STRANGE STEPS BY WHICH I WAS LED TO THE DOING OF IT
THERE WAS A BRUTAL DIRECTNESS ABOUT HIS METHODS WHICH MADE EVASION DIFFICULT
WHY SURELY I CRIED AND GLORIED IN MY OWN AUDACITY BUT WHAT DOES THAT PROVE
AND THERE WAS NEVER ANY BREACH IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE NETHERLANDS THE MARRIAGE OF QUEEN WILHELMINA ON FEBRUARY SEVENTH NINETEEN O ONE WITH PRINCE HENRY OF MECKLENBURG SCHWERIN WAS WELCOMED BY THE PEOPLE
A SUBJECT UPON WHICH HE WAS BY WAY OF BEING AN AUTHORITY FOR AN HOUR OR MORE THAT EVENING I LISTENED TO HIS MONOTONOUS CHIRRUP ABOUT BAD MONEY DRIVING OUT GOOD THE TOKEN VALUE OF SILVER
DON'T LET US HAVE ANY MORE SUCH GOINGS ON SAID HE NOW THEN MOVE ON THERE MOVE ON THIS TO A BUTCHER'S BOY A MAID AND ONE OR TWO LOAFERS WHO HAD COLLECTED HE CLUMPED HEAVILY DOWN THE STREET
THE DEPRECIATION OF THE RUPEE AND THE TRUE STANDARDS OF EXCHANGE SUPPOSE HE CRIED WITH FEEBLE VIOLENCE THAT ALL THE DEBTS IN THE WORLD WERE CALLED UP SIMULTANEOUSLY
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE AWARE SAID HE CHECKING OFF POINTS UPON HIS FINGERS THAT THE CRANIAL INDEX IS A CONSTANT FACTOR NATURALLY SAID
BUT CHANCES ARE ALL AROUND YOU
TACTLESSNESS THAN THROUGH MALICE SO I AM CONTENT TO PASS THE MATTER BY YOU QUOTE AN ISOLATED SENTENCE FROM MY LECTURE AND APPEAR TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING IT
AND SO IT WAS THAT I FOUND MYSELF THAT FOGGY NOVEMBER EVENING PURSUING THE CAMBERWELL TRAM WITH MY HEART GLOWING WITHIN ME AND WITH THE EAGER DETERMINATION THAT NOT ANOTHER DAY SHOULD ELAPSE
IF YOU FIND HIM DANGEROUS REALLY DANGEROUS RING THE BELL AND HOLD HIM OFF UNTIL I COME EVEN AT HIS WORST I CAN USUALLY CONTROL HIM WITH THESE ENCOURAGING WORDS THE LADY HANDED ME OVER TO THE TACITURN AUSTIN
WHICH WAS REJECTED BY THE FIRST CHAMBER A DISSOLUTION OF THIS CHAMBER LED TO THE MAJORITY BEING REVERSED AND THE MEASURE WAS PASSED ANOTHER MEASURE REVISED THE MACKAY LAW AND CONFERRED A LARGER SUBSIDY ON PRIVATE SCHOOLS
IT IS MOST CONSIDERATE OF YOU MADAM GET QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM IF HE SEEMS INCLINED TO BE VIOLENT DON'T WAIT TO ARGUE WITH HIM SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED THROUGH DOING THAT AFTERWARDS THERE IS A PUBLIC SCANDAL AND IT REFLECTS UPON ME AND ALL OF US
IT LED NEVERTHELESS TO THE ABANDONMENT OF THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL AND THE PASSING OF A BILL IN NINETEEN TWELVE FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE DEFENCES OF THE DUTCH SEA PORTS GENERALLY
NOW TELL ME WHAT'S AMISS WITH ME I'M IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SAID SHE IT WAS MY TURN TO JUMP OUT OF MY CHAIR
BUT FORTUNATELY I WAS RESCUED FROM AN ODIOUS SITUATION A POLICEMAN WAS BESIDE US HIS NOTEBOOK IN HIS HAND WHAT'S ALL THIS YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED SAID THE POLICEMAN IT WAS THE MOST RATIONAL REMARK WHICH I HAD HEARD IN ENMORE PARK
AND POSSESSED NO INDEPENDENT MAJORITY IN EITHER CHAMBER FOR THE FIRST TIME A MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY AND TRADE WAS CREATED SUCH AN ADMINISTRATION COULD ONLY LEAD A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE
FOUND ALL THE LIBERAL GROUPS UNITED IN A COMBINED ASSAULT UPON THE CHRISTIAN COALITION A SEVERE ELECTORAL STRUGGLE ENSUED WITH THE RESULT THAT FORTY FIVE LIBERALS AND SEVEN SOCIALISTS WERE RETURNED AGAINST FORTY EIGHT COALITIONISTS
AND HE FELL IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSSIA THAT WAS THE KIND OF MAN I MEAN THINK OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED AND HOW OTHER WOMEN MUST HAVE ENVIED HER THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ENVIED FOR MY MAN I'D HAVE DONE IT TO PLEASE YOU
TO INCREASE CONSIDERABLY THE EXISTING DUTIES AND TO EXTEND LARGELY THE LIST OF DUTIABLE IMPORTS THIS BILL LED TO A WIDESPREAD AGITATION IN THE COUNTRY AND MANY PETITIONS WERE PRESENTED AGAINST IT
CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE THE REIGN OF QUEEN WILHELMINA
THERE'S ONE MAN WHO IS STILL YOUR MASTER
INTO THE WONDERFUL MYSTIC TWILIGHT LAND WHERE LIE THE GREAT ADVENTURES AND THE GREAT REWARDS BEHOLD ME THEN AT THE OFFICE OF THE DAILY GAZETTE ON THE STAFF OF WHICH I WAS A MOST INSIGNIFICANT UNIT
GLADYS WAS FULL OF EVERY WOMANLY QUALITY SOME JUDGED HER TO BE COLD AND HARD BUT SUCH A THOUGHT WAS TREASON THAT DELICATELY BRONZED SKIN
AS TO YOUR SUGGESTION THAT I MAY MODIFY MY OPINION I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT IT IS NOT MY HABIT TO DO SO AFTER A DELIBERATE EXPRESSION OF MY MATURE VIEWS YOU WILL KINDLY SHOW THE ENVELOPE OF THIS LETTER TO MY MAN AUSTIN WHEN YOU CALL
AS AFFORDING HOPES FOR SOME YEARS TO BE DISAPPOINTED OF THE BIRTH OF AN HEIR TO THE THRONE THE ELECTIONS OF NINETEEN O ONE FOUND THE LIBERAL MINISTRY OUT OF FAVOUR THROUGH THE LAWS ENFORCING MILITARY SERVICE AND OBLIGATORY ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL
AND LED TO SANGUINARY REPRISALS ON THE PART OF THE DUTCH SOLDIERY
THE OBJECT BEING TO PREVENT THE BRITISH FLEET FROM SEIZING FLUSHING IN THE EVENT OF THE OUTBREAK OF AN ANGLO GERMAN WAR THE PRESS AGITATION MET HOWEVER WITH NO COUNTENANCE ON THE PART OF RESPONSIBLE STATESMEN IN ANY OF THE COUNTRIES NAMED
IT MAY BE THAT DEATH GIVES ALL THERE IS OF WORTH TO LIFE IF THOSE WHO PRESS AND STRAIN AGAINST OUR HEARTS COULD NEVER DIE PERHAPS THAT LOVE WOULD WITHER FROM THE EARTH
IN POINTING OUT FAULTS WHERE OTHERS SEE NOTHING BUT BEAUTIES THAT IS TO SAY REPLIED MARTIN THAT THERE IS SOME PLEASURE IN HAVING NO PLEASURE WELL
I MAKE THEM LIE WITH ME SOMETIMES FOR I AM VERY TIRED OF THE LADIES OF THE TOWN OF THEIR COQUETRIES OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES
YOU SEE THAT ALREADY I HAVE WON HALF THE WAGER FRIAR GIROFLEE STAYED IN THE DINING ROOM AND DRANK A GLASS OR TWO OF WINE WHILE HE WAS WAITING FOR DINNER BUT SAID CANDIDE TO PAQUETTE YOU LOOKED SO GAY AND CONTENT WHEN I MET YOU
I WISH THAT ALL THE THEATINS WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED A HUNDRED TIMES TO SET FIRE TO THE CONVENT AND GO AND BECOME A TURK
PAQUETTE WORKED AT EMBROIDERY THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
SPEECH CAN NOT CONTAIN OUR LOVE THERE WAS THERE IS NO GENTLER STRONGER
ANOTHER LIFE IS NAUGHT UNLESS WE KNOW AND LOVE AGAIN THE ONES WHO LOVE US HERE THEY WHO STAND WITH BREAKING HEARTS AROUND THIS LITTLE GRAVE NEED HAVE NO FEAR
IF A FAMOUS SURGEON HAD NOT TAKEN COMPASSION ON ME I SHOULD HAVE DIED
MAYBE A COMMON FAITH TREADS FROM OUT THE PATHS BETWEEN OUR HEARTS THE WEEDS OF SELFISHNESS AND I SHOULD RATHER LIVE AND LOVE WHERE DEATH IS KING THAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE WHERE LOVE IS NOT
TO BE DISSECTED TO ROW IN THE GALLEYS IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE
MARTIN FOUND THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF REASON IN POCOCURANTE'S REMARKS
BUT IN THE NIGHT OF DEATH HOPE SEES A STAR AND LISTENING LOVE CAN HEAR THE RUSTLE OF A WING HE WHO SLEEPS HERE WHEN DYING MISTAKING THE APPROACH OF DEATH FOR THE RETURN OF HEALTH
WELL SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN THEIR LEAVE YOU WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST OF MORTALS FOR HE IS ABOVE EVERYTHING HE POSSESSES BUT DO YOU NOT SEE ANSWERED MARTIN THAT HE IS DISGUSTED WITH ALL HE POSSESSES
THE SCENE WAS INTENSELY DRAMATIC A FINE DRIZZLING RAIN WAS FALLING AND EVERY HEAD WAS BENT AND EVERY EAR TURNED TO CATCH THE IMPASSIONED WORDS OF ELOQUENCE AND HOPE THAT FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE FAMED ORATOR
WHICH APPEARS SO PLEASANT TO YOU MEN WHILE TO US WOMEN IT IS THE UTMOST ABYSS OF MISERY I HAVE COME TO EXERCISE THE PROFESSION AT VENICE
FOR WHETHER IN MID SEA OR AMONG THE BREAKERS OF THE FARTHER SHORE A WRECK MUST MARK AT LAST THE END OF EACH AND ALL AND EVERY LIFE NO MATTER IF ITS EVERY HOUR IS RICH WITH LOVE
NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN IN ITALY COULD TAKE PLEASURE IN THOSE MELANCHOLY EXTRAVAGANCES AND THE MARRIAGE OF SIN AND DEATH AND THE SNAKES BROUGHT FORTH BY SIN
THE FLOWER OF HEALTH SHINES IN YOUR FACE YOUR EXPRESSION MAKES PLAIN YOUR HAPPINESS YOU HAVE A VERY PRETTY GIRL FOR YOUR RECREATION AND YOU SEEM WELL SATISFIED WITH YOUR STATE AS A THEATIN MY FAITH SIR SAID FRIAR GIROFLEE
SOON AFTER MISTER INGERSOLL BEGAN TO READ HIS ELOQUENT CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DEAD HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS HE TRIED TO HIDE THEM BEHIND HIS EYE GLASSES
BUT BEING WEARY FOR A MOMENT HE LAY DOWN BY THE WAYSIDE AND USING HIS BURDEN FOR A PILLOW FELL INTO THAT DREAMLESS SLEEP THAT KISSES DOWN HIS EYELIDS STILL
AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
AND HIS ACCOUNT OF A BAD DINNER OR OF HIS LOW QUARREL BETWEEN ONE RUPILIUS WHOSE WORDS HE SAYS WERE FULL OF POISONOUS FILTH AND ANOTHER WHOSE LANGUAGE WAS IMBUED WITH VINEGAR I HAVE READ WITH MUCH DISTASTE HIS INDELICATE VERSES AGAINST OLD WOMEN AND WITCHES
REPLIED THE SENATOR THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND AND NOT THREE DOZEN OF THEM GOOD FOR ANYTHING AS TO THOSE COLLECTIONS OF SERMONS WHICH ALTOGETHER ARE NOT WORTH A SINGLE PAGE OF SENECA AND THOSE HUGE VOLUMES OF THEOLOGY
TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES TO HAVE A BUTTOCK CUT OFF TO RUN THE GAUNTLET AMONG THE BULGARIANS TO BE WHIPPED AND HANGED AT AN AUTO DA FE
YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT MY DEAR MARTIN ALL IS MISERY AND ILLUSION HE FELL INTO A DEEP MELANCHOLY AND NEITHER WENT TO SEE THE OPERA NOR ANY OF THE OTHER DIVERSIONS OF THE CARNIVAL
IT IS TRUE I HAVE PREACHED A FEW BAD SERMONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ME IN A LITTLE MONEY OF WHICH THE PRIOR STOLE HALF WHILE THE REST SERVES TO MAINTAIN MY GIRLS
FROM THE WONDROUS TREE OF LIFE THE BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FALL WITH RIPENED FRUIT AND IN THE COMMON BED OF EARTH PATRIARCHS AND BABES SLEEP SIDE BY SIDE
AT LEAST YOU WILL ALLOW ME SAID CANDIDE TO MARTIN THAT THESE TWO ARE HAPPY HITHERTO I HAVE MET WITH NONE BUT UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE HABITABLE GLOBE EXCEPT IN EL DORADO BUT AS TO THIS PAIR I WOULD VENTURE TO LAY A WAGER THAT THEY ARE VERY HAPPY I LAY YOU THEY ARE NOT SAID MARTIN
AND ALL MY FELLOWS ARE IN THE SAME CASE
AND EVERY MOMENT JEWELED WITH A JOY WILL AT ITS CLOSE BECOME A TRAGEDY
THEN HER KIND FRIEND THE BIRD BROUGHT A DRESS STILL FINER THAN THE FORMER ONE AND SLIPPERS WHICH WERE ALL OF GOLD SO THAT WHEN SHE CAME TO THE FEAST NO ONE KNEW WHAT TO SAY FOR WONDER AT HER BEAUTY AND THE KING'S SON DANCED WITH NOBODY BUT HER
AND ON HIS WAY HOME AS HE RODE THROUGH A GREEN COPSE A HAZEL TWIG BRUSHED AGAINST HIM AND ALMOST PUSHED OFF HIS HAT SO HE BROKE IT OFF AND BROUGHT IT AWAY AND WHEN HE GOT HOME HE GAVE IT TO HIS DAUGHTER THEN SHE TOOK IT
GOODBYE HANS HANS TAKES THE NEEDLE STICKS IT INTO A HAY CART AND FOLLOWS THE CART HOME GOOD EVENING MOTHER GOOD EVENING HANS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN WITH GRETEL WHAT DID YOU TAKE HER
AND ON TO THE HAZEL TREE AND HAD THERE TAKEN OFF HER BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES AND PUT THEM BENEATH THE TREE THAT THE BIRD MIGHT CARRY THEM AWAY AND HAD LAIN DOWN AGAIN AMID THE ASHES IN HER LITTLE GREY FROCK THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE FEAST WAS AGAIN HELD
NEVER MIND WILL DO BETTER NEXT TIME WHITHER AWAY HANS TO GRETEL MOTHER BEHAVE WELL HANS I'LL BEHAVE WELL GOODBYE MOTHER GOODBYE HANS HANS COMES TO GRETEL GOOD DAY GRETEL
SO HE CUT OFF HER HEAD AND AS SHE WAS BEING DRESSED FOR THE SPIT THE QUEEN'S RING WAS FOUND INSIDE HER THE SERVANT COULD NOW EASILY PROVE HIS INNOCENCE AND THE KING TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE WRONG
AND I WILL LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND WATCH OVER YOU SOON AFTERWARDS SHE SHUT HER EYES AND DIED AND WAS BURIED IN THE GARDEN AND THE LITTLE GIRL WENT EVERY DAY TO HER GRAVE AND WEPT AND WAS ALWAYS GOOD AND KIND TO ALL ABOUT HER
THIS HAD GONE ON FOR A LONG TIME WHEN ONE DAY THE SERVANT WHO TOOK AWAY THE DISH WAS OVERCOME WITH SUCH CURIOSITY THAT HE COULD NOT HELP CARRYING THE DISH INTO HIS ROOM WHEN HE HAD CAREFULLY LOCKED THE DOOR HE LIFTED UP THE COVER
ONE AND ALL COME HELP ME QUICK HASTE YE HASTE YE PICK PICK PICK THEN FIRST CAME TWO WHITE DOVES FLYING IN AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW NEXT CAME TWO TURTLE DOVES AND AFTER THEM CAME ALL THE LITTLE BIRDS UNDER HEAVEN
THIS IS NOT THE TRUE BRIDE SAID HE TO THE FATHER HAVE YOU NO OTHER DAUGHTERS NO SAID HE THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE DIRTY ASHPUTTEL HERE THE CHILD OF MY FIRST WIFE I AM SURE SHE CANNOT BE THE BRIDE THE PRINCE TOLD HIM TO SEND HER
ASHPUTTEL'S TWO SISTERS WERE ASKED TO COME SO THEY CALLED HER UP AND SAID NOW COMB OUR HAIR BRUSH OUR SHOES AND TIE OUR SASHES FOR US FOR WE ARE GOING TO DANCE AT THE KING'S FEAST THEN SHE DID AS SHE WAS TOLD BUT WHEN ALL WAS DONE SHE COULD NOT HELP CRYING
IN THIS GARDEN STOOD A FINE LARGE PEAR TREE FULL OF RIPE FRUIT AND ASHPUTTEL NOT KNOWING WHERE TO HIDE HERSELF JUMPED UP INTO IT WITHOUT BEING SEEN THEN THE KING'S SON LOST SIGHT OF HER AND COULD NOT FIND OUT WHERE SHE WAS GONE
THAT HE MIGHT SEE INTO WHAT HOUSE SHE WENT
I LED HER BY THE ROPE TIED HER TO THE RACK AND SCATTERED SOME GRASS FOR HER THAT WAS ILL DONE HANS YOU SHOULD HAVE CAST FRIENDLY EYES ON HER NEVER MIND WILL DO BETTER
PRINCE PRINCE LOOK AGAIN FOR THY BRIDE FOR SHE'S NOT THE TRUE ONE THAT SITS BY THY SIDE THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND SAW THAT THE BLOOD STREAMED SO MUCH FROM THE SHOE THAT HER WHITE STOCKINGS WERE QUITE RED SO HE TURNED HIS HORSE AND BROUGHT HER ALSO BACK AGAIN
ALLOWED HIM TO ASK A FAVOUR AND PROMISED HIM THE BEST PLACE IN THE COURT THAT HE COULD WISH FOR THE SERVANT REFUSED EVERYTHING AND ONLY ASKED FOR A HORSE AND SOME MONEY FOR TRAVELLING
THAT SHE BROUGHT HOME WITH HER THEY WERE FAIR IN FACE BUT FOUL AT HEART AND IT WAS NOW A SORRY TIME FOR THE POOR LITTLE GIRL WHAT DOES THE GOOD FOR NOTHING WANT IN THE PARLOUR SAID THEY
THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT BRIDE LET THE OTHER SISTER TRY AND PUT ON THE SLIPPER THEN SHE WENT INTO THE ROOM AND GOT HER FOOT INTO THE SHOE ALL BUT THE HEEL WHICH WAS TOO LARGE BUT HER MOTHER SQUEEZED IT IN TILL THE BLOOD CAME AND TOOK HER TO THE KING'S SON
AND HER FATHER MOTHER AND SISTERS WERE GONE ASHPUTTEL WENT TO THE HAZEL TREE AND SAID SHAKE SHAKE HAZEL TREE GOLD AND SILVER OVER ME AND THE BIRD CAME AND BROUGHT A STILL FINER DRESS THAN THE ONE SHE HAD WORN THE DAY BEFORE AND WHEN SHE CAME IN IT TO THE BALL

THEY WHO WOULD EAT BREAD SHOULD FIRST EARN IT AWAY WITH THE KITCHEN MAID THEN THEY TOOK AWAY HER FINE CLOTHES AND GAVE HER AN OLD GREY FROCK TO PUT ON AND LAUGHED AT HER AND TURNED HER INTO THE KITCHEN THERE
AND PUT ON THE GOLDEN SLIPPER AND IT FITTED HER AS IF IT HAD BEEN MADE FOR HER AND WHEN HE DREW NEAR AND LOOKED AT HER FACE HE KNEW HER AND SAID THIS IS THE RIGHT BRIDE BUT THE MOTHER AND BOTH THE SISTERS WERE FRIGHTENED AND TURNED PALE WITH ANGER AS HE TOOK ASHPUTTEL ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY WITH HER
MANY HAD ALREADY MADE THE ATTEMPT BUT IN VAIN NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE YOUTH SAW THE KING'S DAUGHTER
SHE WENT DOWN INTO THE GARDEN AND STREWED WITH HER OWN HANDS TEN SACKSFUL OF MILLET SEED ON THE GRASS THEN SHE SAID
HAS BEEN TREADING DOWN MY PEOPLE WITHOUT MERCY SO HE TURNED ON TO A SIDE PATH AND THE ANT KING CRIED OUT TO HIM WE WILL REMEMBER YOU ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER THE PATH LED HIM INTO A WOOD
LONG BEFORE THE END OF THE HOUR THE WORK WAS QUITE DONE AND ALL FLEW OUT AGAIN AT THE WINDOWS THEN ASHPUTTEL BROUGHT THE DISH TO HER MOTHER OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT THAT NOW SHE SHOULD GO TO THE BALL BUT THE MOTHER SAID NO NO YOU SLUT
GOOD EVENING HANS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN WITH GRETEL WHAT DID YOU TAKE HER I TOOK HER NOTHING SHE GAVE ME SOMETHING WHAT DID GRETEL GIVE YOU GAVE ME A BIT OF BACON WHERE IS THE BACON HANS
TO GET WHAT INFORMATION HE COULD FROM BRAND WHITLOCK THE AMERICAN MINISTER IN BELGIUM HE WENT AT ONCE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES BUT THEY EVADED HIS QUESTIONS AND WAITED TEN DAYS BEFORE GIVING HIM A REPLY THEN THE GERMANS SENT HIM A STATEMENT
HIS SOUL WAS NAKED TO THE BITTER WIND OF THE ACTUAL AND THE DAYS WENT BY WENT BY AND EVERY DAY HE KNEW MORE AND MORE SURELY THAT HE HAD LIED AND THROWN AWAY HIS SOUL AND THAT THE WAGES OF SIN WERE DEATH AND NO OTHER THING WHATEVER
BUT THERE ARE SOME ACTS THAT THERE IS NO UNDOING AND THE HELL THAT HAD BURNED IN HIS HEART SO FIERCELY WHEN HE HAD SEEN HER IN THE OTHER MAN'S ARMS BURNED NOW WITH NEW BRIGHT LIGHTS AND INFERNAL FLICKERING FLAME TONGUES AND AT LAST OUT OF HELL
ANOTHER LAWYER WHO WAS A BELGIAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AND TOLD THE AMERICANS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST CAUSE FOR THEM TO WORRY AS MISS CAVELL WAS SURE TO RECEIVE ONLY JUST TREATMENT HE ALSO PROMISED TO LET THEM KNOW WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO TAKE PLACE
HE WALKED WITH MORE THAN HIS ORDINARY FIRMNESS OF GAIT AS A MAN DOES WHO IS JUST DRUNK ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE MUST TRY TO LOOK SOBER HE WALKED DOWN THE STREET CERTAIN WORDS RINGING IN HIS EARS HEART AFFECTED PROBABLY HEREDITARY WEAKNESS
DON'T HE SAID TENDERLY DON'T WORRY IT'S ALL RIGHT I WAS A FOOL PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER THERE'S SOMEONE COMING I DON'T CARE SHE SAID
BUT THIS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES THEY WERE DETERMINED TO DETECT HER IN SOME CRIME AND PUNISH HER IT WAS NOT FITTING THEY THOUGHT THAT AN ENEMY SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN WORKS OF MERCY EVEN THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT BENEFIT THEREBY
SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES KNOW OF THE AFFAIR OR OF WHAT THEY PROPOSED TO DO BUT WORD OF HER PLIGHT DID REACH ENGLAND THROUGH A TRAVELER AND AT ONCE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REQUESTED THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR DOCTOR PAGE
OH DON'T SHE CRIED I DON'T REALLY WANT THEM PLEASE NOT I WISH THEN SHE STOPPED BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY SOME TWELVE FEET FROM THE GROUND AND SHE KNEW THAT ONE SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO A MAN WHO IS CLIMBING RUINED WALLS
WHAT DID HE DIE OF FOR THE ANSWER WAS HEART AND IN IT THE DEVIL ROSE AND SHOWED THE ONLOOKER THE REALLY ONLY TRUE AND ARTISTIC WAY TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IN THIS SITUATION SO DRAMATIC IN ITS POSSIBILITIES
AND WHEN HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD HE SAW THAT THE LOVER MIGHT NOT FIND IT OUT MIGHT BE PASSED FOR THE ARMY MIGHT GO TO THE FRONT MIGHT BE KILLED AND THEN WELL I'VE DONE MY BEST ANYHOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF
WHY SHOULD HE HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM THREE WEEKS AGO HE'S A VERY OLD FRIEND OF OURS I DO HATE TO BE SUSPICIOUS BUT IT IS ODD AND THEN HIS TRYING TO GET YOU TO SOUTH AFRICA
AND PULLED HIMSELF UP TILL HIS KNEE WAS ON THE MOULDING OF THE ARCH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED ANYONE WHO HAD TOLD HER THAT ONLY TWO MINUTES HAD BEEN LIVED BETWEEN THE MOMENT OF HIS STUMBLE AND THE OTHER MOMENT WHEN HIS FOOT TOUCHED THE GRASS
AN AMERICAN LAWYER MISTER DE LEVAL WAS REQUESTED BY MISTER WHITLOCK TO TAKE MISS CAVELL'S CASE AND DO WHATEVER WAS POSSIBLE IN HER BEHALF HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SEE THE PRISONER AND WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS IN THE CASE UNTIL THE TRIAL BEGAN
BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ME UP IF I WON'T BE GIVEN UP CAN YOU HIS SMILE STRUCK HER DUMB IT WAS MORE CONVINCING THAN HIS WORDS
I'M CERTAIN HE WANTED YOU OUT OF THE WAY HE WANTED YOU TO GET KILLED OH HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO CRUEL
IT'S BETTER TO DIE OF A BULLET IN SOUTH AFRICA THAN OF FRIGHT IN LONDON THAT ROUSED THE LOVER AS IT WAS MEANT TO DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IT IS OF YOURS SIR HE SAID
YOU WILL NEVER LET HIM GO TO SOUTH AFRICA WITHOUT TELLING HIM THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT WELL YOU KNOW BEST I SUPPOSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT ARE YOU PERFECTLY CERTAIN
AND AT FIRST THEY WERE INCLINED TO LOOK UPON MISS CAVELL AS AN UNTRAINED OUTSIDER BUT HER TACT EFFICIENCY AND SKILL SOON WON THE HEARTS OF THESE GOOD WOMEN WHO AFFORDED HER EVERY COURTESY AND ENTERED INTO CORDIAL COOPERATION WITH HER
HE TURNED AWAY AND WENT BACK ALONG THE GREEN PATH WITH HELL IN HIS HEART THE OTHER TWO WERE IN PARADISE THE ONLOOKER FELL LIKE THE THIRD IN EDEN THE SERPENT IN FACT TWO MILES AWAY HE STOPPED AND LIT A PIPE
HER EYES HAD BLUE MARKS UNDER THEM HER CHIN HAD GROWN MORE POINTED HER NOSE SHARPER THERE WAS A NEW LINE ON HER FOREHEAD AND HER EYES HAD CHANGED OVER THE WINE HE HEARD FROM THE FATHER THAT SHE WAS PINING FOR THE LOVER WHO HAD INHERITED HEART DISEASE
THEY SHINE LIKE GOLD SHE SAID
SHE STUDIED AT THE LONDON HOSPITAL A PLACE WE ARE TOLD WHERE THE HARDEST AND MOST DIFFICULT CONDITIONS PREVAILED AND WHERE THE NURSES WERE WORKED TO THE LIMIT OF THEIR STRENGTH SHE ALSO HELD THE POSITION OF A NURSE IN TWO OTHER HOSPITALS
AND THOUGH HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF THE JOY OF SPEAKING IN WORDS HE HAD LET HIS EYES SPEAK MORE THAN HE KNEW AND NOW HE HAD REACHED THE WALLFLOWERS HIGH UP AND WAS PLUCKING THEM AND THROWING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY FELL IN A WAVERING BRIGHT SHOWER ROUND HER FEET
THE LOVER WAS SHORT WITH THE ONLOOKER BUT HE PERSISTED WELL IF ONE ISN'T INTERESTED IN ONE'S LIFE ONE MAY BE INTERESTED IN ONE'S DEATH OR THE MANNER OF IT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD ENLIST
CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARMS JUST ABOVE THE ELBOW SHOOK HIM ANGRILY AS ONE SHAKES A NAUGHTY CHILD LOOKED HIM ONCE IN THE EYES AND BURIED HER FACE IN HIS NECK SOBBING LONG DRY BREATHLESS SOBS EVEN THEN HE TRIED TO BE STRONG
HE NEVER INFORMED THEM THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD BEEN IMPOSED HE NEVER CAME TO SEE THEM AFTERWARD AND WHEN THEY SOUGHT HIM FOR AN EXPLANATION AND FOR ASSISTANCE HE HAD DISAPPEARED MISS CAVELL WAS KEPT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR TWO MONTHS
FOR THE TOUCH OF HIS CHEEK PRESSED AGAINST HER HAIR TOLD HER ALL THAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW LET THEM COME I DON'T CARE OH HOW COULD YOU BE SO SILLY AND HORRID
WAS VALUABLE AND CONVENIENT TO THE DUTCH BUT FROM THE VAST EXTENT OF TERRITORY LATELY ACQUIRED IN INDIA WE HAVE PLENTY OF THAT COMMODITY WITHOUT GOING TO THE DUTCH MARKET CLOSE TO THE DUTCH TOWN IS A CHINESE TOWN AND TEMPLE
WHICH WE NAMED MOUNT TEMPLE
WITH HILL AND DALE AND EQUALLY BEAUTIFUL AS DIVERSIFIED WITH ROTTI AND ITS APPENDANT ISLES IT IS AS LARGE AS THE ISLAND OF GREAT BRITAIN ITS PRINCIPAL TRADE
AND BIDDING HIM FAREWELL JUMPED OVER THE QUARTER INTO THE WATER THE CAPTAIN THEN FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND JUMPED AFTER HIM AT THAT INSTANT SHE TOOK HER LAST HEEL AND WHILE EVERY ONE WERE SCRAMBLING TO WINDWARD SHE SUNK
WAS OPEN FOR THEIR RECEPTION THEY DREW BILLS ON THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND WERE SUPPLIED WITH EVERY NECESSARY THEY STOOD IN NEED OF THE CAPTAIN OF A DUTCH
TO WHICH THE NAME OF MURRAY'S ISLANDS WAS GIVEN
WHEN I TELL THEM PROFESSIONALLY THAT ALL THE MORTALITY OF THAT PLACE ORIGINATES FROM MARSH EFFLUVIA ARISING FROM THEIR STAGNANT CANALS AND PLEASURE GROUNDS
BY WHICH MEANS HE WENT MAD AND DIED IN THE SEQUEL OF THE VOYAGE NEXT MORNING MISTER GEORGE PASSMORE THE MASTER WAS DISPATCHED IN ONE OF THE BOATS TO VISIT THE WRECK TO SEE IF ANY THING FLOATED ROUND HER
IT IS ABOUT SEVEN MILES LONG AND BEING A NEW DISCOVERY WE CALLED IT GRENVILLE'S ISLAND IN HONOUR OF LORD GRENVILLE THE NAME THE NATIVES GAVE IT IS ROTUMAH THEY CAME OFF IN A FLEET OF CANOES RESTED ON THEIR PADDLES
IN WHICH SAMARANG IS BUILT IT IS GAUDY AND CALCULATED TO PLEASE THE GENERALITY OF OBSERVERS ALLOW ME TO MENTION THE SINGULAR MANNER IN WHICH THE MONKEYS
AND BIRDS UPON EVERY PART OF THEM SO THAT EVERY MAN WAS A MOVING LANDSCAPE THESE MARKS WERE ALL RAISED AND DONE I SUPPOSE BY PINCHING UP THE SKIN THEY WERE GREAT ADEPTS IN THIEVING AND UNCOMMONLY ATHLETIC AND STRONG
SEEING OUR PASSAGE OBSTRUCTED AND STOOD OFF AND ON UNDER AN EASY SAIL
IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT THE STRAITS OF ALICE
THAT THE ANCHOR ON OUR BOW WAS UNDER WATER
THEY MADE AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE VESSEL FROM THEM WHICH THEY ALWAYS WILL TO A SMALL VESSEL WHEN ALONE BUT THEY WERE SOON OVERPOWERED WITH THE FIRE ARMS
WHICH PROMISES BETTER ANCHORAGE THAN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE FRIENDLY ISLES THE NATIVES TOLD US THERE WERE EXCELLENT WATERING PLACES IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTS WITHIN THE SOUND
HAD BEEN THROWN INTO THE BOAT THE HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE REFLECTION FROM THE SAND WAS NOW EXCRUCIATING AND OUR STOMACHS BEING FILLED WITH SALT WATER FROM THE GREAT LENGTH OF TIME WE WERE SWIMMING BEFORE WE WERE PICKED UP
HE OVERPOWERED THEM ALL AND JUMPED OVERBOARD WITH HIS PRIZE
THE TOWN IS REGULAR AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE HOUSES ARE BUILT IN A STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE WHICH HAS GIVEN LOOSE TO THE MOST SPORTIVE FANCY EACH STREET IS TERMINATED WITH SOME PUBLIC BUILDING SUCH AS A GREAT MARINE SCHOOL
IN THE TORPID PHRASEOLOGY OF THE LOG WITH DITTO REPEATED
THE COMMANDING OFFICER WHO HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SHOOT HIM ON NOT FINDING THE SHIP NEXT DAY THEY GAVE UP ALL FURTHER HOPES OF HER AND STEERED FOR ANAMOOKA THE RENDEZVOUS CAPTAIN EDWARDS HAD APPOINTED
SEEMS TO HAVE STUDIED WITH MUCH INGENUITY TO RENDER IT A CADAVEROUS STINKING PRISON AFTER BEING REFRESHED AT THE CAPE WE PASSED SAINT HELENA THE ISLAND OF ASCENSION AND ARRIVED AT HOLLAND
SOME OF THE PRISONERS WERE LET OUT OF IRONS AND TURNED TO THE PUMPS AT THIS DREADFUL CRISIS IT BLEW VERY VIOLENTLY AND SHE BEAT SO HARD UPON THE ROCKS THAT WE EXPECTED HER EVERY MINUTE TO GO TO PIECES
TWO SMALL WINE GLASSES OF WATER A DAY TO EACH MAN FOR SIXTEEN DAYS A SAW AND HAMMER HAD FORTUNATELY BEEN IN ONE OF THE BOATS WHICH ENABLED US WITH THE GREATER EXPEDITION TO MAKE
THIS EVENING
WAS PERFORMED BY HIS DRINKING A BUMPER OF BRANDY AND GUNPOWDER STIRRED ROUND WITH THE POINT OF A SWORD AFTER BEING INVESTED WITH THE REGAL DIGNITY HE CAME DOWN IN STATE TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO THE GOVERNOR
WAS COMPOSED OF VERY LARGE STONES AND CALLED IT STONY REEF ISLAND
TO THE SOUTHWARD STOOD TO THE WESTWARD WHERE THERE APPEARED TO BE AN OPENING WE SAW AN ISLAND IN THAT DIRECTION AND A REEF EXTENDING A CONSIDERABLE WAY TO THE NORTH WEST
TO GET READY TO DISCOVER IF THERE WAS A PASSAGE FOR THE SHIP
BY THE SMALLNESS OF THE WINDOWS
HAS NOT BEEN NEGLECTED AND THOSE OBJECTS OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE ARE PLACED IN A PROPER POINT OF VIEW AS THE JUST PRIDE AND ORNAMENT OF A GREAT COMMERCIAL PEOPLE SUCH IS THE EFFECT OF EARLY PREJUDICES THAT UNDER THE MUZLE OF THE SUN
THAT THE TRANSCENDENT WORTH OF A BRITISH SEAMAN IS MOST CONSPICUOUS NOR WOULD I WISH
THEY WERE HOWEVER PERFECTLY IGNORANT OF FIRE ARMS AND SEEMED MUCH STARTLED AT THE REPORT OF A MUSKET WERE TOO SHY TO STAND THE EXPERIMENT OF A GREAT GUN AS THEY CAME OFF WITH HOSTILE INTENTIONS THEY BROUGHT NO WOMEN WITH THEM
LIKEWISE AMPLY TO SUPPLY THE SLAVE TRADE FROM THE PRISONERS OF BOTH PARTIES THEY HOWEVER SOME TIME SINCE MADE HEAD AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY
THE SOUND ITSELF WAS CALLED CURTIS'S SOUND UNDER THE GENERAL DENOMINATION OF HOWE'S ISLANDS WERE INCLUDED
THEY HAVE A GOVERNOR OF THEIR OWN NATION BUT PAY LARGE TRIBUTE TO THE DUTCH NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR TRADE IS UNDER VERY SEVERE RESTRICTIONS THEY SOON MAKE RICH AND AS SOON AS THEY BECOME INDEPENDENT RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY
THE IMPETUOSITY IMAGINABLE ON A SAVAGE SHORE ABOUT SEVEN MILES
MY BROTHER IS ALSO AT WORK WITH ME AND DOING WELL THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT WOULD INTEREST YOU IN THE WAY OF NEWS THERE IS A MASONIC LODGE OF OUR PEOPLE AND TWO CHURCHES AND SOCIETYS HERE AND SOME OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR OUR BENEFIT
ON THE NINTH DAY HE COULD JUST SING ONE BAR AND ON THE TENTH DAY ONLY ONE NOTE THIS CAT HAD A GREAT DISLIKE FOR MONTHS AFTERWARDS TO MILK IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM
REMINDING YOU ONLY THEN BY HER LOUD SINGING AND DEMONSTRATIVE KINDNESS THAT THERE IS STILL A LITTLE HOLE IN HER STOMACH THAT WANTS FILLING AND HOW PATIENTLY SIT AND WAIT
AND A MOST HEARTLESS WRETCH HE WAS IN JOE'S ESTIMATION THE TRUTH WAS JOE COULD NOT STAND THE BURDENS AND ABUSES WHICH SADLER WAS INCLINED TO HEAP UPON HIM SO HE CONCLUDED TO JOIN HIS BROTHER
BUT IN LONG LINGERING ILLNESSES PUSSY IS A MUCH BETTER PATIENT PUSSY MOREOVER IS BLESSED WITH EXTREME GOOD NATURE AND WILL PARDON ALMOST ANY INJURY FROM ONE SHE LOVES
IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE THEM GREASED AND RUBBED TO MAKE THEM LOOK BRIGHT AND SHINING AND HE WENT ON FURTHER TO STATE THAT FEMALES AS WELL AS MALES WERE NOT UNCOMMONLY STRIPPED NAKED LASHED FLAT TO A BENCH AND THEN HELD BY TWO MEN SOMETIMES FOUR
AND SPOKE OF HER IN MOST ENDEARING LANGUAGE ALTHOUGH ON LEAVING HE DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO APPRISE HER OF HIS MOVEMENTS FEARING THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE SO TO DO HIS FOUR LITTLE CHILDREN TO WHOM HE APPEARED WARMLY ATTACHED
THE ANIMAL WAS IN A TREE AND ON THE GENTLEMAN'S APPROACH IT SPRANG DOWN AND COMMENCED RUBBING ROUND HIS LEGS WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS ON BENDING DOWN TO CARESS IT
AND SHOW FIGHT OR RUN OFF GROWLING PERHAPS INDEED ONLY HALF AWAKE BUT MALICE SHE NEVER HARBOURS IN HER HEART AND IN HALF AN HOUR WHEN SHE HAS THOUGHT THE MATTER OVER
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD HAD BUT FEW PRIVILEGES SUNDAYS AND WEEK DAYS ALIKE HE WAS KEPT PRETTY SEVERELY BENT DOWN TO DUTY HE HAD BEEN BEATEN AND KNOCKED AROUND SHAMEFULLY HE HAD A WIFE
VERY WELL SAID ROBERT TO DAY I WILL PLEASE MY MASTER SO WELL THAT I WILL CATCH HIM AT AN UNGUARDED MOMENT
AND EVERY TIME THE POULTICE WAS CHANGED THE CAT LICKED HER HAND IN EVIDENT GRATITUDE IN FACT TOM MADE THE BEST OF PATIENTS BEING MORE LIKE A SINCERE CHRISTIAN THAN ANYTHING ELSE
A BEAUTIFUL GROUSE OR PLUMP LITTLE PARTRIDGE WITNESS THEIR PATIENCE AND LONG SUFFERING WITH CHILDREN THIS I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN ABOUT AND NEED NOT REPEAT HAVING PROVED
AS WELL AS WRITING TO A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE JOE AND BOB HAD THE ASSURANCE TO WRITE BACK TO THE TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE KEEPER IN THEIR LETTER THEY STATED THAT THEY HAD ARRIVED SAFELY IN CANADA AND WERE HAVING GOOD TIMES
UNTIL THEY MIGHT REACH THE DEPOT AT PHILADELPHIA THE RICHMOND DISPATCH AN ENTERPRISING PAPER IN THE INTEREST OF SLAVEHOLDERS WHICH CAME DAILY TO THE COMMITTEE WAS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF THE PASSENGERS
PUSSY'S PATIENCE AND CLEANLINESS NEXT TO A CAT'S LOVE FOR CHILDREN IF THERE IS ONE THING MORE THAN ANOTHER THAT OUGHT TO MAKE ONE LOVE HER AND RESPECT HER AS A PET IT IS THE EXTREME PATIENCE
AT THE SALE OF ONE OF HER CHILDREN SHE WAS SO AFFECTED WITH GRIEF THAT SHE WAS THROWN INTO VIOLENT CONVULSIONS
SO PITIFUL AN OBJECT LOOKED HE THAT HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS HAD THE SIN OF KEEPING HIM ALIVE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT TO THEM BY THEIR FRIENDS INDEED HE WAS NOW SO WEAK AS TO BE UNABLE TO MOVE
THE HUSBAND OF MARY HAD FOR A LONG TIME WANTED HIS OWN FREEDOM BUT DID NOT FEEL THAT HE COULD GO WITHOUT HIS WIFE IN FACT HE RESOLVED TO GET HER OFF FIRST THEN TO TRY AND ESCAPE HIMSELF IF POSSIBLE
A REGULAR NEGRO TRADER EIGHT YEARS THIS SLAVE'S DUTIES HAD BEEN AT THE SLAVE PRISON AND AMONG OTHER DAILY OFFICES HE HAD TO ATTEND TO WAS TO LOCK UP THE PRISON
AND WATCH FOR THE RETURN OF HER MASTER OR MISTRESS BE THEY NEVER SO LONG ABSENT SHE KNOWS THEIR FOOTSTEPS AND JUMPS UP AT THEIR KNOCK AND RUNS TO THE DOOR TO MEET THEM I KNOW OF A POOR CAT
AND WITHOUT FIRST GREASING THEMSELVES AND THEN HANGING ON VERY FAST THE JOURNEY MIGHT NOT PROVE ALTOGETHER ADVANTAGEOUS TO THEM THIS WAS WORMWOOD AND GALL TO THE TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE MAN A MOST REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE WAS THAT
IS APPENDED A SHORT LETTER ANNOUNCING THEIR ARRIVAL AND CONDITION UNDER THE BRITISH LION SAINT CATHARINE APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
THIS WAS THE TURNING POINT OF HIS ILLNESS HE BEGAN TO RALLY AND SOON GOT WELL AND PLUMP AND SLEEK AND THE OTHER DAY DIED AT THE AGE OF TWELVE BUT IT WAS A TREAT TO SEE HOW
AND SEEMED IN NO WAY INCONVENIENCED FROM THE LOSS OF ITS HIND LEG BUT TRAVELLERS NEVER CAN SETTLE AND PUSS TOOK TO THE WOODS AGAIN
AS HAVING BECOME SO DAILY SICK OF THE BRUTALITY AND SUFFERING HE COULD NOT HELP WITNESSING THAT HE FELT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY STAND IT ANY LONGER LET THE COST BE WHAT IT MIGHT IN THIS STATE OF MIND HE MET WITH CAPTAIN B
WAS IN LIKE MANNER CAUGHT IN A TRAP AND HAD TO ENDURE AMPUTATION OF THE LEG ALTHOUGH IN MUCH SUFFERING AND PAIN
YOU WILL GIVE MY RESPECT TO YOUR LADY AND MISTER AND MISSUS BROWN IF YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN TO PETERSBURG YOU WILL PLEASE TO WRITE AS SOON AS CAN I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO WRITE AT PRESENT BUT YOURS RESPECTFULLY EMMA BROWN
HOW DID YOU GET INTO THE HOUSE IN PICCADILLY I ASKED HE WAS THERE TOO
I THOUGHT I HAD BEST MEET HIM ON HIS OWN GROUND SO I SAID YOUR CLIENTS SIR ARE HAPPY IN HAVING SO RESOLUTE A GUARDIAN OF THEIR CONFIDENCE I AM MYSELF A PROFESSIONAL MAN HERE I HANDED HIM MY CARD
TO DAY HARKER IS OUT FOLLOWING UP HIS CLUE AND ART AND QUINCEY ARE LOOKING AFTER HORSES GODALMING THINKS THAT IT WILL BE WELL TO HAVE HORSES ALWAYS IN READINESS
AND ON THE SOUTH THE NORTH AND WEST WERE SURELY NEVER MEANT TO BE LEFT OUT OF HIS DIABOLICAL SCHEME LET ALONE THE CITY ITSELF AND THE VERY HEART OF FASHIONABLE LONDON IN THE SOUTH WEST AND WEST
IN THIS INSTANCE I AM NOT PROMPTED BY CURIOSITY I ACT ON THE PART OF LORD GODALMING WHO WISHES TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE PROPERTY WHICH WAS HE UNDERSTOOD LATELY FOR SALE THESE WORDS PUT A DIFFERENT COMPLEXION ON AFFAIRS
AS HE THOUGHT HE REMEMBERED SEEING THE NAME OF THAT FIRM ON THE BOARD I DID NOT WISH TO SEEM TOO EAGER OR TO LET MY INFORMANT KNOW OR GUESS TOO MUCH SO THANKING HIM IN THE USUAL MANNER I STROLLED AWAY IT WAS NOW GROWING DUSK
WHEN SHE CAME BACK I ADDRESSED THE ENVELOPE AND STAMPED IT AND WHEN SMOLLET HAD AGAIN FAITHFULLY PROMISED TO POST THE ADDRESS WHEN FOUND I TOOK MY WAY TO HOME WE'RE ON THE TRACK ANYHOW I AM TIRED TO NIGHT
HE DID NOT REPLY FOR A MOMENT BUT LOOKED ALL ROUND HIM AND UP AND DOWN AS THOUGH HE EXPECTED TO FIND SOME INSPIRATION FOR AN ANSWER I DON'T WANT ANY SOULS HE SAID IN A FEEBLE APOLOGETIC WAY
IF YOU WILL LET ME HAVE HIS LORDSHIP'S ADDRESS I WILL CONSULT THE HOUSE ON THE SUBJECT AND WILL IN ANY CASE COMMUNICATE WITH HIS LORDSHIP BY TO NIGHT'S POST IT WILL BE A PLEASURE IF WE CAN SO FAR DEVIATE FROM OUR RULES AS TO GIVE THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO HIS LORDSHIP
THOUGH I FELT THAT BY SO DOING I WAS LOWERING MYSELF IN THE EYES OF THE LUNATIC AND WHY WITH ENOCH BECAUSE HE WALKED WITH GOD I COULD NOT SEE THE ANALOGY BUT DID NOT LIKE TO ADMIT IT
THAN IN BEING HERE AMONGST US AND IN IGNORANCE I ONLY SAW DOCTOR SEWARD FOR A MOMENT AND TOLD HIM WHERE I WAS OFF TO PROMISING TO COME BACK AND TELL THE REST SO SOON AS I SHOULD HAVE FOUND OUT ANYTHING
COMPLETE THE TASK UNOBSERVED AT PICCADILLY CIRCUS I DISCHARGED MY CAB AND WALKED WESTWARD BEYOND THE JUNIOR CONSTITUTIONAL I CAME ACROSS THE HOUSE DESCRIBED AND WAS SATISFIED THAT THIS WAS THE NEXT OF THE LAIRS ARRANGED BY DRACULA
BUT HE WOULD NOT ATTEND HE WENT ON WITH HIS SINGING JUST AS THOUGH WE HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT HE HAD GOT A SCRAP OF PAPER AND WAS FOLDING IT INTO A NOTE BOOK WE HAD TO COME AWAY AS IGNORANT AS WE WENT IN
SO I HARKED BACK TO WHAT HE HAD DENIED SO YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT LIFE AND YOU DON'T WANT SOULS WHY NOT I PUT MY QUESTION QUICKLY AND SOMEWHAT STERNLY ON PURPOSE TO DISCONCERT HIM THE EFFORT SUCCEEDED
I COULDN'T EAT THEM OR HE SUDDENLY STOPPED AND THE OLD CUNNING LOOK SPREAD OVER HIS FACE LIKE A WIND SWEEP ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND DOCTOR AS TO LIFE WHAT IS IT AFTER ALL WHEN YOU'VE GOT ALL YOU REQUIRE
HIS IS A CURIOUS CASE INDEED WE MUST WATCH HIM TO NIGHT LETTER MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY TO LORD GODALMING
THANK GOD THIS WILL BE THE LAST NIGHT OF HER LOOKING ON AT OUR CONFERENCES AND FEELING THE STING OF OUR NOT SHOWING OUR CONFIDENCE IT TOOK ALL MY COURAGE TO HOLD TO THE WISE RESOLUTION OF KEEPING HER OUT OF OUR GRIM TASK
I SOMETIMES THINK WE MUST BE ALL MAD AND THAT WE SHALL WAKE TO SANITY IN STRAIT WAISTCOATS LATER WE HAVE MET AGAIN WE SEEM AT LAST TO BE ON THE TRACK AND OUR WORK OF TO MORROW MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END
HE OPENED HIS EYES A THOUGHT WIDER AND PAUSED A FEW SECONDS BEFORE REPLYING IT IS SOLD SIR PARDON ME I SAID WITH EQUAL POLITENESS BUT I HAVE A SPECIAL REASON FOR WISHING TO KNOW WHO PURCHASED IT
HARKER IS OUT FOLLOWING UP CLUES AND SO ARE LORD GODALMING AND QUINCEY VAN HELSING SITS IN MY STUDY PORING OVER THE RECORD PREPARED BY THE HARKERS
AGAIN HE PAUSED LONGER AND RAISED HIS EYEBROWS STILL MORE IT IS SOLD SIR WAS AGAIN HIS LACONIC REPLY SURELY I SAID YOU DO NOT MIND LETTING ME KNOW SO MUCH
I LEARNED HOWEVER FROM HIS WIFE WHO SEEMED A DECENT POOR SOUL THAT HE WAS ONLY THE ASSISTANT TO SMOLLET WHO OF THE TWO MATES WAS THE RESPONSIBLE PERSON SO OFF I DROVE TO WALWORTH
THANK GOD THE CEASING OF TELLING THINGS HAS MADE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US WHEN I CAME DOWN AGAIN I FOUND THE OTHERS ALL GATHERED ROUND THE FIRE IN THE STUDY IN THE TRAIN I HAD WRITTEN MY DIARY SO FAR
AND WE ARE IN GREAT HOPES THAT HIS CLUE MAY BE AN IMPORTANT ONE BEFORE GOING TO BED I WENT ROUND TO THE PATIENT'S ROOM AND LOOKED IN THROUGH THE OBSERVATION TRAP
HE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO OBLIGE YOU IF I COULD MISTER HARKER AND ESPECIALLY WOULD I LIKE TO OBLIGE HIS LORDSHIP WE ONCE CARRIED OUT A SMALL MATTER OF RENTING SOME CHAMBERS FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS THE HONOURABLE ARTHUR HOLMWOOD
THE HOUSE LOOKED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN LONG UNTENANTED THE WINDOWS WERE ENCRUSTED WITH DUST AND THE SHUTTERS WERE UP ALL THE FRAMEWORK WAS BLACK WITH TIME AND FROM THE IRON THE PAINT HAD MOSTLY SCALED AWAY
I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF BRINGING THIS DIARY RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT I AM VERY SLEEPY AND SHALL GO TO BED JUST A LINE MINA SLEEPS SOUNDLY AND HER BREATHING IS REGULAR HER FOREHEAD IS PUCKERED UP INTO LITTLE WRINKLES
I PLACED A MAN IN THE CORRIDOR LAST NIGHT AND TOLD HIM TO MAKE AN ACCURATE NOTE OF ANY SOUND HE MIGHT HEAR FROM RENFIELD'S ROOM AND GAVE HIM INSTRUCTIONS THAT IF THERE SHOULD BE ANYTHING STRANGE HE WAS TO CALL ME
THE SUBMARINE CABLE THE TELEPHONE THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY THE ELECTRIC TROLLEY CAR THE STORAGE BATTERY THE ELECTRIC MOTOR THE PHONOGRAPH THE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH
AND MAKING IT DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ALL PRECEDING TIME EVEN IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN FEW OF THESE THINGS HAD LOST THEIR NOVELTY MOST OF THEM WERE IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT BUT IT IS WHEN WE TURN TO ELECTRICITY
FROM THE PASSAGES BEHIND SHE COULD HEAR AGAIN THE QUICK BELL NOTE REPEAT ITSELF AS THE LOBBIES WERE CLEARED AND FROM PARLIAMENT SQUARE OUTSIDE ONCE MORE CAME THE HEAVY MURMUR OF THE CROWD THAT HAD BEEN INAUDIBLE FOR THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES WHEN THAT CEASED SHE WOULD KNOW THAT HE WAS COME
BY THE RATIONAL COMPROMISE WITH ENGLAND IN THE DISPUTE OVER THE OREGON REGION PRESIDENT POLK HAD SECURED DURING EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX FOR UNDISTURBED SETTLEMENT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF FOREST FERTILE LAND AND FISHERIES
NOW HE WAS JUST A BLIND BREATHING CARCASE NOTHING MORE AND SHE STILL WORKED WITH FRAIL ENERGY STILL SWEPT AND BAKED AND WASHED FETCHED AND CARRIED IF THERE WERE SOMETHING IN THESE WISE OLD DOGS THAT DID NOT PERISH UTTERLY WITH DEATH
THE NAMES CHANGED BUT IT WAS ALWAYS LIBRULS AND TOORIES YELLOWS AND BLUES AND THEY ALWAYS QUARRELLED AND SHOUTED AS TO WHO WAS RIGHT AND WHO WAS WRONG THE ONE THEY QUARRELLED ABOUT MOST WAS A FINE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH AN ANGRY FACESHE
ON WHOSE FRONT PAGE WAS THE RECORD IN FADED INK OF A BAPTISM DATED NINETY FOUR YEARS AGO MARTHA CRALE WAS THE NAME WRITTEN ON THAT YELLOW PAGE THE YELLOW WRINKLED OLD DAME WHO HOBBLED AND MUTTERED ABOUT THE KITCHEN
THERE HAD BEEN A PALMERSTON THAT HAD BEEN A NAME DOWN TIVERTON WAY TIVERTON WAS NOT A FAR JOURNEY AS THE CROW FLIES BUT TO MARTHA IT WAS ALMOST A FOREIGN COUNTRY LATER THERE HAD BEEN NORTHCOTES AND ACLANDS AND MANY OTHER NEWER NAMES THAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN
BUT SHE WAS NOT MISTRESS OF THE KITCHEN ON ONE OF THE SHELVES OF AN OLD DRESSER IN COMPANY WITH CHIPPED SAUCE BOATS PEWTER JUGS CHEESE GRATERS AND PAID BILLS RESTED A WORN AND RAGGED BIBLE
WHO DIVIDED HIS TIME BETWEEN AMATEUR HORSE DEALING RABBIT SHOOTING AND FLIRTING WITH THE FARM MAIDS IM AFRAID OLD MARTHA IS DYING SAID EMMA JIM WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON TO WHOM ONE HAD TO BREAK NEWS GENTLY NONSENSE
THEN SHE LEANED FORWARD FROM HER CORNER AND STARED DOWN INTO THE HOUSE A GREAT CHANGE HAD PASSED OVER IT AT THE METALLIC NOISE ALL DOWN THE LONG BROWN SEATS MEMBERS WERE SHIFTING AND ARRANGING THEMSELVES MORE DECOROUSLY UNCROSSING THEIR LEGS
EVERYTHING WAS CRUDE AND PRIMITIVE THE POLES WERE TWO HUNDRED FEET APART AND COULD BARELY HOLD UP A WASH LINE
OF A BEE WANDERING IN AT A WINDOW ON A SUMMERS DAY USED AT FIRST TO WATCH HER WITH A KIND OF FRIGHTENED CURIOSITY SHE WAS SO OLD AND SO MUCH A PART OF THE PLACE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO THINK OF HER EXACTLY AS A LIVING THING OLD SHEP
LIFE SUSTENANCE AND PATERNITY CELEBRATED ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH QUARTER SUNDAY WORSHIP WAS TO BE PURELY VOLUNTARY SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANY MAN COULD REFUSE THIS HOMAGE THESE FOUR THINGS WERE FACTS
AND TELEGRAPHY SPRANG INTO ACTIVE BEING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC AT THE TIME EDISON WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN TELEGRAPHY UPON WHICH HE WAS TO LEAVE SO INDELIBLE AN IMPRINT HAD BARELY STRUGGLED INTO ACCEPTANCE BY THE PUBLIC
AND THEIR SCARLET COMBS AND THE DRAKES WITH THEIR BOTTLE GREEN HEADS
HOW STRANGE AND WONDERFUL IT WAS TO BE HERE ON THIS NIGHT OF ALL WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS TO SPEAK A MONTH AGO HE HAD ASSENTED TO A SIMILAR BILL IN GERMANY AND HAD DELIVERED A SPEECH ON THE SAME SUBJECT AT TURIN TO MORROW HE WAS TO BE IN SPAIN
WITH ITS VIOLENT RHETORIC AS TO THE RIGHTS OF MAN WAS SOBERING DOWN AND PASSING PERVASIVELY INTO NUMEROUS PRACTICAL SCHEMES FOR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL AMELIORATION CONSTITUTING IN THEIR ENTIRETY A MOST PROFOUND CHANGE THROUGHOUT EVERY PART OF THE NATIONAL LIFE
CATHOLICS COULD STILL GO TO MASS AND YET APPALLING THINGS WERE THREATENED IN GERMANY NOT LESS THAN TWELVE THOUSAND PERSONS HAD ALREADY LEFT FOR ROME AND IT WAS RUMOURED THAT FORTY THOUSAND WOULD REFUSE THIS SIMPLE ACT OF HOMAGE A FEW DAYS HENCE IT BEWILDERED AND ANGERED HER TO THINK OF IT
NOW SUCH AN INTIMATE PART OF HUMAN NATURE'S DAILY FOOD THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN TO DAY PAYS MORE FOR HIS ELECTRICAL SERVICE THAN HE DOES FOR BREAD WITH THE FIRST YEAR OF THE NEW CENTURY CAME VOLTA'S INVENTION OF THE CHEMICAL BATTERY
WERE NOT MUCH GREATER THAN THOSE TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FLIGHT OF A ROCKET WHILE THE FRICTIONAL APPLIANCE IS STILL EMPLOYED IN MEDICINE IT RANKS WITH THE FLINT AXE AND THE TINDER BOX IN INDUSTRIAL OBSOLESCENCE NO ART OR TRADE COULD BE FOUNDED ON IT
LOOKING LIKE A DEAD AUTUMN LEAF WHICH THE WINTER WINDS STILL PUSHED HITHER AND THITHER HAD ONCE BEEN MARTHA CRALE FOR SEVENTY ODD YEARS SHE HAD BEEN MARTHA MOUNTJOY FOR LONGER THAN ANYONE COULD REMEMBER
MABEL SEATED IN THE GALLERY THAT EVENING BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S CHAIR
EMMA WITH THE LATEST SCIENCE OF DEAD POULTRY DRESSING AT HER FINGER TIPS SAT BY AN UNHEEDED WATCHER WHILE OLD MARTHA TRUSSED THE CHICKENS FOR THE MARKET STALL AS SHE HAD TRUSSED THEM FOR NEARLY FOURSCORE YEARSALL
THE OPEN GANGWAYS THE GREAT MACE ON THE TABLE AND HEARD ABOVE THE MURMUR OF THE CROWD OUTSIDE AND THE DYING WHISPERS WITHIN HER OWN HEART BEAT SHE COULD NOT SEE HIM SHE KNEW HE WOULD COME IN FROM BENEATH THROUGH THE DOOR THAT NONE BUT HE MIGHT USE
AND THE CIRCUIT WAS DOWN FOR THIRTY SIX DAYS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS THE LITTLE GLASS KNOB INSULATORS MADE SEDUCTIVE TARGETS FOR IGNORANT SPORTSMEN ATTEMPTS TO INSULATE THE LINE WIRE WERE LIMITED
BUT MARTHA SAT HUDDLED IN A SHRUNKEN BUNCH ON THE WINDOW SEAT
WITH HER BOXES ALREADY STOWED IN THE FARM CART TILL THE LAST OF THE MARKET PRODUCE SHOULD BE READY FOR THE TRAIN SHE WAS TO CATCH WAS OF LESS IMPORTANCE THAN THE CHICKENS AND BUTTER AND EGGS THAT WERE TO BE OFFERED FOR SALE FROM WHERE SHE STOOD
AND SO I WISH TO ARRANGE JUST A SMALL PARTY FOR MY OWN AND MY WIFE'S FRIENDS HE SMILED STILL MORE PLEASANTLY
AND BERG AND VERA IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR EVENING PARTY INTERRUPTING EACH OTHER IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ENTERTAIN THEIR GUEST VERA HAVING DECIDED IN HER OWN MIND
THE STRAINS OF THE POLONAISE WHICH HAD CONTINUED FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME HAD BEGUN TO SOUND LIKE A SAD REMINISCENCE TO NATASHA'S EARS SHE WANTED TO CRY
I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEING ALREADY ACQUAINTED IF THE COUNTESS REMEMBERS ME SAID PRINCE ANDREW WITH A LOW AND COURTEOUS BOW QUITE BELYING
SAID HE THEY RECEIVED PIERRE IN THEIR SMALL NEW DRAWING ROOM WHERE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SIT DOWN ANYWHERE WITHOUT DISTURBING ITS SYMMETRY NEATNESS AND ORDER
THE DESPAIRING DEJECTED EXPRESSION OF NATASHA'S FACE CAUGHT HIS EYE HE RECOGNIZED HER GUESSED HER FEELINGS SAW THAT IT WAS HER DEBUT REMEMBERED HER CONVERSATION AT THE WINDOW
SAT BERG AND HIS WIFE BERG CLOSELY BUTTONED UP IN HIS NEW UNIFORM SAT BESIDE HIS WIFE EXPLAINING TO HER THAT ONE ALWAYS COULD
BECAUSE ONLY THEN DOES ONE GET SATISFACTION FROM ACQUAINTANCES YOU CAN GET TO KNOW SOMETHING YOU CAN ASK FOR SOMETHING
THERE WAS A SHADE OF CONDESCENSION AND PATRONAGE IN HIS TREATMENT OF BERG AND VERA AFTER BORIS CAME A LADY WITH THE COLONEL THEN THE GENERAL HIMSELF THEN THE ROSTOVS
PERONSKAYA'S REMARKS ABOUT HIS RUDENESS AND APPROACHING NATASHA HE HELD OUT HIS ARM TO GRASP HER WAIST BEFORE HE HAD COMPLETED HIS INVITATION HE ASKED HER TO WALTZ
HER LITTLE FEET IN THEIR WHITE SATIN DANCING SHOES DID THEIR WORK SWIFTLY LIGHTLY AND INDEPENDENTLY OF HERSELF WHILE HER FACE BEAMED WITH ECSTATIC HAPPINESS
HUSBAND AND WIFE GLANCED AT ONE ANOTHER BOTH SMILING WITH SELF SATISFACTION AND EACH MENTALLY CLAIMING THE HONOR OF THIS VISIT
I HAVE NOW QUITE SETTLED IN MY NEW ROOMS COUNT BERG SAID THIS WITH PERFECT CONVICTION THAT THIS INFORMATION COULD NOT BUT BE AGREEABLE
AH SHE'S NOT THE ONE I'M AFTER SO IT'S NOT WORTH LOOKING AT HER NO
THE HANDSOME ANATOLE WAS SMILINGLY TALKING TO A PARTNER ON HIS ARM AND LOOKED AT NATASHA AS ONE LOOKS AT A WALL BORIS PASSED THEM TWICE AND EACH TIME TURNED AWAY
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT INTERESTS EACH OF THEM AND WHAT TO SAY TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE BERG SMILED AGAIN IT CAN'T BE HELPED MEN MUST SOMETIMES HAVE MASCULINE CONVERSATION
PIERRE CAME UP TO HIM AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARM YOU ALWAYS DANCE I HAVE A PROTEGEE THE YOUNG ROSTOVA HERE ASK HER HE SAID
SEE HOW I MANAGED FROM MY FIRST PROMOTION BERG MEASURED HIS LIFE NOT BY YEARS BUT BY PROMOTIONS MY COMRADES ARE STILL NOBODIES
PRINCE ANDREW IN THE WHITE UNIFORM OF A CAVALRY COLONEL WEARING STOCKINGS AND DANCING SHOES STOOD LOOKING ANIMATED AND BRIGHT IN THE FRONT ROW OF THE CIRCLE
WHO CROWDED NEAR THE WALL NOT HAVING BEEN INVITED TO DANCE SHE STOOD WITH HER SLENDER ARMS HANGING DOWN HER SCARCELY DEFINED BOSOM
I HAVE LONG BEEN WAITING FOR YOU THAT FRIGHTENED HAPPY LITTLE GIRL SEEMED TO SAY
UNFORTUNATELY SHE COULD NOT GRANT MY REQUEST BUT I HOPE COUNT I SHALL BE MORE FORTUNATE WITH YOU HE SAID WITH A SMILE WHAT IS IT YOU WISH COLONEL I AM AT YOUR SERVICE
WITH HIS HAIR POMADED AND BRUSHED FORWARD OVER HIS TEMPLES AS THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER WORE HIS HAIR I HAVE JUST BEEN TO SEE THE COUNTESS YOUR WIFE
PRINCE ANDREW AS ONE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH SPERANSKI AND PARTICIPATING IN THE WORK OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMISSION COULD GIVE RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SITTING
TO STAND FARTHER BACK THOUGH AS IT WAS THEY WERE ALREADY CLOSE TO THE WALL AND FROM THE GALLERY RESOUNDED THE DISTINCT PRECISE ENTICINGLY RHYTHMICAL STRAINS OF A WALTZ
NOT FAR FROM THE ROSTOVS BARON FIRHOFF WAS TALKING TO HIM ABOUT THE FIRST SITTING OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE
THIS IS WHAT COMES OF KNOWING HOW TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCES THOUGHT BERG THIS IS WHAT COMES OF KNOWING HOW TO CONDUCT ONESELF
AND THE PARTY BECAME UNQUESTIONABLY EXACTLY LIKE ALL OTHER EVENING PARTIES BERG AND VERA COULD NOT REPRESS THEIR SMILES OF SATISFACTION AT THE SIGHT OF ALL THIS MOVEMENT IN THEIR DRAWING ROOM
WHICH EVERYONE ADDRESSED TO HIM WISHING ALSO TO BREAK UP THE CIRCLE OF RESTRAINT HE DISLIKED CAUSED BY THE EMPEROR'S PRESENCE HE DANCED AND HAD CHOSEN NATASHA BECAUSE PIERRE POINTED HER OUT TO HIM
AND TOLD ME TO BURN IT IF NOT YET DESPATCHED SHE IS FOREVER SPEAKING OF IT AND SAYING THAT IT WILL KILL YOU DO NOT DELAY YOUR DEPARTURE FOR AN INSTANT IF YOU WISH TO SEE THE ANGEL BEFORE SHE LEAVES US PRAY EXCUSE THIS SCRIBBLE
AND HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS I SPRANG TO MY FEET AND ASKED WHAT THE MATTER WAS AH NATALIA SAVISHNA IF YOU COULD ONLY KNOW WHAT I HAVE JUST SEEN SHE SAID
ONLY NOW DID I UNDERSTAND THE SOURCE OF THE STRONG OPPRESSIVE SMELL WHICH MINGLING WITH THE SCENT OF THE INCENSE FILLED THE CHAMBER WHILE THE THOUGHT THAT THE FACE WHICH BUT A FEW DAYS AGO HAD BEEN FULL OF FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY
KATENKA IS AS CHARMING AS USUAL AND MIMI TOO IS GOOD BUT TIRESOME NOW LET ME SPEAK OF MORE SERIOUS MATTERS YOU WRITE TO ME THAT YOUR AFFAIRS ARE NOT GOING WELL THIS WINTER
THE NOISE AWAKENED ME AND MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT SEEING ME STANDING ON THE CHAIR IN A POSTURE WHICH HAD NOTHING TOUCHING IN ITS ASPECT
AS I RECALL NOW MY IMPRESSIONS OF THAT EPISODE I FIND THAT IT WAS ONLY DURING MY MOMENTS OF SELF FORGETFULNESS THAT MY GRIEF WAS WHOLEHEARTED TRUE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE FUNERAL I NEVER CEASED TO CRY
THE HORSES AND CARRIAGE STUCK FAST IN THE MUD WELL THE DAY BEING FINE I THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD WALK A LITTLE UP THE ROAD UNTIL THE CARRIAGE SHOULD BE EXTRICATED BUT NO SOONER HAD WE REACHED THE CHAPEL
AT TEN O'CLOCK WE WERE SUMMONED TO ATTEND THE PRE FUNERAL REQUIEM THE ROOM WAS FULL OF WEEPING SERVANTS AND PEASANTS WHO HAD COME TO BID FAREWELL TO THEIR LATE MISTRESS DURING THE SERVICE I MYSELF WEPT A GREAT DEAL
HE WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW AND ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY RESTRAINED HIS TEARS HIS TALL FIGURE IN ITS BLACK FROCKCOAT HIS PALE EXPRESSIVE FACE THE GRACEFUL ASSURED MANNER IN WHICH AS USUAL
THE CANDLES THE BROCADE THE VELVET THE GREAT CANDELABRA THE PINK SATIN CUSHION TRIMMED WITH LACE THE CHAPLET OF FLOWERS THE RIBBONED CAP AND SOMETHING OF A TRANSPARENT
THEY LIKED TO BE THE FIRST TO GIVE US THAT NAME JUST AS SOME PEOPLE FIND PLEASURE IN BEING THE FIRST TO ADDRESS A NEWLY MARRIED GIRL AS MADAME IN A FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM
I THINK OF GETTING UP TO MORROW ON FRIDAY LAST I TOOK THE GIRLS FOR A DRIVE AND CLOSE TO THE LITTLE BRIDGE BY THE TURNING ON TO THE HIGH ROAD THE PLACE WHICH ALWAYS MAKES ME NERVOUS
DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE JUST WRITTEN TO YOU ABOUT MY ILLNESS IT IS MORE SERIOUS THAN ANY ONE KNOWS I ALONE KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER LEAVE MY BED AGAIN DO NOT THEREFORE DELAY A MINUTE IN COMING HERE WITH THE CHILDREN
HE MIGHT TAKE ME FOR AN UNFEELING BOY WHO HAD CLIMBED ON TO THE CHAIR OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY WHEREFORE I HASTENED TO MAKE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS TO BEND DOWN MY HEAD AND TO BURST OUT CRYING
THOUGH STILL UNABLE TO TURN MY EYES AWAY THEN AGAIN THE DREAMS WOULD REPLACE REALITY THEN AGAIN THE REALITY PUT TO FLIGHT THE DREAMS AT LAST THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BOTH LEFT ME
AND HER CAP COCKED TO ONE SIDE WHILE HER EYES WERE RED WITH WEEPING HER LEGS TREMBLING UNDER HER AND SHE SOBBED INCESSANTLY IN A HEARTRENDING MANNER AS EVER AND AGAIN SHE BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDKERCHIEF OR HER HANDS
AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH TERROR THAT WERE I TO LIVE A HUNDRED YEARS MORE I SHOULD NEVER FORGET IT EVEN NOW THE RECOLLECTION ALWAYS SENDS A COLD SHUDDER THROUGH MY FRAME I RAISED MY HEAD
YOU KNOW MY OBJECTION TO THAT KIND OF EDUCATION I DO NOT KNOW DEAR WHETHER YOU WILL ACCEDE TO MY REQUEST BUT I NEVERTHELESS BESEECH YOU BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME TO GIVE ME YOUR PROMISE THAT NEVER SO LONG AS I AM ALIVE
ALIVE HAPPY AND SMILING THEN SOME WELL KNOWN FEATURE IN THE FACE AT WHICH I WAS GAZING WOULD SUDDENLY ARREST MY ATTENTION AND IN A FLASH I WOULD RECALL THE TERRIBLE REALITY AND SHUDDER
SUCH OF THOSE PRESENT AS WERE STRANGERS I FOUND INTOLERABLE
I IMAGINE THAT SHE DID THIS TO CHECK HER CONTINUAL SOBBING WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY THE SPECTATORS I REMEMBER TOO HER TELLING PAPA THE EVENING BEFORE
AND SHE IS MOST ATTENTIVE AND ATTACHED TO ME SHE EVEN TELLS ME HER SECRET AFFAIRS UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES HER BEAUTIFUL FACE GOOD TEMPER AND YOUTH MIGHT HAVE MADE A MOST EXCELLENT GIRL OF HER
THAT IT HAD SEEN MY SORROW AND PITYING ME HAD RETURNED TO EARTH ON THE WINGS OF LOVE TO CONSOLE AND BLESS ME WITH A HEAVENLY SMILE OF COMPASSION
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ON A TABLE LAY THE COFFIN WITH WAX CANDLES BURNING ALL ROUND IT ON TALL SILVER CANDELABRA IN THE FURTHER CORNER SAT THE CHANTER READING THE PSALMS IN A LOW MONOTONOUS VOICE
GO AND RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU WE SHALL ALL OF US BE LONELY SPRING IS COMING IN BEAUTIFULLY WE KEEP THE DOOR ON TO THE TERRACE ALWAYS OPEN NOW WHILE THE PATH TO THE ORANGERY
FOR I FEEL INDEED I KNOW SINCE GOD HAS DEIGNED TO REVEAL IT TO ME THAT I HAVE NOW BUT A VERY SHORT TIME TO LIVE WILL MY LOVE FOR YOU AND THE CHILDREN CEASE WITH MY LIFE I KNOW THAT THAT CAN NEVER BE
SOME OF THEM IN REFERRING TO OURSELVES CALLED US ORPHANS JUST AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT A MATTER OF COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT CHILDREN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR MOTHER ARE KNOWN AS ORPHANS PROBABLY I THOUGHT
TO WHICH THE AUTHORITY AND CARE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE RELATE AN IGNORANCE OF A VARIETY OF MINUTE AND PARTICULAR OBJECTS WHICH DO NOT LIE WITHIN THE COMPASS OF LEGISLATION IS CONSISTENT WITH EVERY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARY TO A DUE PERFORMANCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE TRUST
THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS IN THE TWO KINGDOMS OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND CANNOT BE STATED AT LESS THAN EIGHT MILLIONS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THESE EIGHT MILLIONS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AMOUNT TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT
WILL IN ALL OF THEM BE THE FRUITS OF A MORE ADVANCED POPULATION AND WILL REQUIRE ON THE PART OF EACH STATE A FULLER REPRESENTATION
IN DETERMINING THE EXTENT OF INFORMATION REQUIRED IN THE EXERCISE OF A PARTICULAR AUTHORITY RECOURSE THEN MUST BE HAD TO THE OBJECTS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THAT AUTHORITY WHAT ARE TO BE THE OBJECTS OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION
OF TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY CONSTITUTENTS IN AN ASSEMBLY EXPOSED TO THE WHOLE FORCE OF EXECUTIVE INFLUENCE AND EXTENDING ITS AUTHORITY TO EVERY OBJECT OF LEGISLATION WITHIN A NATION WHOSE AFFAIRS
WHILST A FEW REPRESENTATIVES THEREFORE FROM EACH STATE MAY BRING WITH THEM A DUE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR OWN STATE EVERY REPRESENTATIVE WILL HAVE MUCH INFORMATION TO ACQUIRE CONCERNING ALL THE OTHER STATES THE CHANGES OF TIME
AND DEPEND ON CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CAN DIFFER BUT LITTLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SAME STATE
BUT WILL NOT THIS ALSO BE POSSESSED IN SUFFICIENT DEGREE BY A VERY FEW INTELLIGENT MEN DIFFUSIVELY ELECTED WITHIN THE STATE DIVIDE THE LARGEST STATE INTO TEN OR TWELVE DISTRICTS
OF DUTIES WHICH WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION OF COMMERCE SO FAR THE PRECEDING REMARK IS APPLICABLE TO THIS OBJECT AS FAR AS IT MAY CONSIST OF INTERNAL COLLECTIONS A MORE DIFFUSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STATE MAY BE NECESSARY
WITHOUT TAKING INTO VIEW AT THE SAME TIME THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WILL DISTINGUISH THE CONGRESS FROM OTHER LEGISLATIVE BODIES THE BEST ANSWER THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO IT WILL BE A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THESE PECULIARITIES
BUT OF THOSE AMONG DIFFERENT STATES TAKING EACH STATE BY ITSELF ITS LAWS ARE THE SAME AND ITS INTERESTS BUT LITTLE DIVERSIFIED A FEW MEN THEREFORE WILL POSSESS ALL THE KNOWLEDGE REQUISITE FOR A PROPER REPRESENTATION OF THEM
AS WAS FORMERLY REMARKED ON THE COMPARATIVE SITUATION OF THE DIFFERENT STATES WILL HAVE AN ASSIMILATING EFFECT THE EFFECT OF TIME ON THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE STATES TAKEN SINGLY WILL BE JUST THE CONTRARY
AND IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THERE WILL BE NO PECULIAR LOCAL INTERESTS IN EITHER WHICH WILL NOT BE WITHIN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DISTRICT BESIDES THIS SOURCE OF INFORMATION THE LAWS OF THE STATE FRAMED BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM EVERY PART OF IT
WITHOUT ANY AID FROM ORAL INFORMATION AND IT MAY BE EXPECTED THAT WHENEVER INTERNAL TAXES MAY BE NECESSARY AND PARTICULARLY IN CASES REQUIRING UNIFORMITY THROUGHOUT THE STATES THE MORE SIMPLE OBJECTS WILL BE PREFERRED
THE OBSERVATIONS MADE ON THE SUBJECT OF TAXATION APPLY WITH GREATER FORCE TO THE CASE OF THE MILITIA FOR HOWEVER DIFFERENT THE RULES OF DISCIPLINE MAY BE IN DIFFERENT STATES THEY ARE THE SAME THROUGHOUT EACH PARTICULAR STATE
THEY MIGHT THEREFORE WITH GREAT PROPRIETY BE CONSIDERED AS SOMETHING MORE THAN A MERE DEDUCTION FROM THE REAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION WE WILL HOWEVER CONSIDER THEM IN THIS LIGHT ALONE
DOES NOT IN ANY RESPECT CONTRADICT WHAT WAS URGED ON ANOTHER OCCASION WITH REGARD TO THE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION
EACH HAVING AND EXERCISING WITHIN ITSELF A POWER OF LOCAL LEGISLATION IS IT NOT EVIDENT THAT A DEGREE OF LOCAL INFORMATION AND PREPARATORY LABOR WOULD BE FOUND IN THE SEVERAL VOLUMES OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS
WHICH PRESENTS TO MANKIND SO MANY POLITICAL LESSONS BOTH OF THE MONITORY AND EXEMPLARY KIND AND WHICH HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY CONSULTED IN THE COURSE OF THESE INQUIRIES CORROBORATES THE RESULT OF THE REFLECTIONS WHICH WE HAVE JUST MADE
BUT WILL PROBABLY IN ALL CASES HAVE BEEN MEMBERS AND MAY EVEN AT THE VERY TIME BE MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHERE ALL THE LOCAL INFORMATION AND INTERESTS OF THE STATE ARE ASSEMBLED
WERE THE INTERESTS AND AFFAIRS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND UNIFORM A KNOWLEDGE OF THEM IN ONE PART WOULD INVOLVE A KNOWLEDGE OF THEM IN EVERY OTHER AND THE WHOLE STATE MIGHT BE COMPETENTLY REPRESENTED BY A SINGLE MEMBER TAKEN FROM ANY PART OF IT
IT CANNOT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE HALF THUS ELECTED AND WHO DO NOT EVEN RESIDE AMONG THE PEOPLE AT LARGE CAN ADD ANY THING EITHER TO THE SECURITY OF THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND INTERESTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCILS
ON A COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENT STATES TOGETHER WE FIND A GREAT DISSIMILARITY IN THEIR LAWS AND IN MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE OBJECTS OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION WITH ALL OF WHICH THE FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES OUGHT TO HAVE SOME ACQUAINTANCE
THE FORESIGHT OF THE CONVENTION HAS ACCORDINGLY TAKEN CARE THAT THE PROGRESS OF POPULATION MAY BE ACCOMPANIED WITH A PROPER INCREASE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT THE EXPERIENCE OF GREAT BRITAIN
THE GENERAL FACE OF THE COUNTRY WHETHER MOUNTAINOUS OR LEVEL MOST FIT FOR THE OPERATIONS OF INFANTRY OR CAVALRY IS ALMOST THE ONLY CONSIDERATION OF THIS NATURE THAT CAN OCCUR THE ART OF WAR TEACHES GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIZATION MOVEMENT AND DISCIPLINE
THOSE WHICH ARE OF MOST IMPORTANCE AND WHICH SEEM MOST TO REQUIRE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE ARE COMMERCE TAXATION AND THE MILITIA A PROPER REGULATION OF COMMERCE REQUIRES MUCH INFORMATION AS HAS BEEN ELSEWHERE REMARKED
ARE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE DIVERSIFIED AND COMPLICATED YET IT IS VERY CERTAIN NOT ONLY THAT A VALUABLE PORTION OF FREEDOM HAS BEEN PRESERVED UNDER ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THAT THE DEFECTS IN THE BRITISH CODE ARE CHARGEABLE IN A VERY SMALL PROPORTION
AS THIS OBJECTION EVIDENTLY PROCEEDS FROM A COMPARISON OF THE PROPOSED NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES WITH THE GREAT EXTENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE NUMBER OF THEIR INHABITANTS AND THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR INTERESTS
OF THIS NUMBER ONE NINTH ARE ELECTED BY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR PERSONS AND ONE HALF BY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PERSONS
AND TO RACK HIS BRAINS FOR EXCUSES TO PREVARICATE
I SHALL GO TO RAZUMIHIN'S OF COURSE BUT NOT NOW I SHALL GO TO HIM ON THE NEXT DAY AFTER IT WHEN IT WILL BE OVER AND EVERYTHING
BUT COMPLETELY WORN OUT
DRUNK BUT NOT EXTREMELY SO SITTING BEFORE A POT OF BEER AND HIS COMPANION A HUGE STOUT MAN
WOULD HAVE CREATED SURPRISE OWING TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE HAY MARKET THE NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS OF BAD CHARACTER THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE TRADING
WITH A KIND OF EFFORT HE BEGAN ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM SOME INNER CRAVING TO STARE AT ALL THE OBJECTS BEFORE HIM AS THOUGH LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO DISTRACT HIS ATTENTION
HE FORGOT AT ONCE WHAT HE HAD JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT AND EVEN WHERE HE WAS GOING IN THIS WAY
AND AT EVERY STEP HIS EXCITEMENT GREW MORE AND MORE VIOLENT
UTTERING A NEW WORD IS WHAT THEY FEAR MOST BUT I AM TALKING TOO MUCH
THREE TIMES AS BIG AS ALL THE OTHERS
OR SUDDENLY WAKING UP AGAIN
BAWLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE AND POINTING AT HIM THE YOUNG MAN STOPPED SUDDENLY AND CLUTCHED TREMULOUSLY AT HIS HAT
TO HIS WEARY EYES AFTER THE DUST OF THE TOWN AND THE HUGE HOUSES THAT HEMMED HIM IN
NEAR THE TAVERN THE ROAD BECAME A DUSTY TRACK THE DUST OF WHICH WAS ALWAYS BLACK
COULD NEVER HAVE INVENTED THEM IN THE WAKING STATE SUCH SICK DREAMS ALWAYS REMAIN LONG IN THE MEMORY AND MAKE A POWERFUL IMPRESSION ON THE OVERWROUGHT AND DERANGED NERVOUS SYSTEM
LOOKING ROUND HE NOTICED THAT HE WAS STANDING CLOSE TO A TAVERN WHICH WAS ENTERED BY STEPS LEADING FROM THE PAVEMENT TO THE BASEMENT AT THAT INSTANT TWO DRUNKEN MEN
THERE WAS NOT A SPECK OF DUST TO BE SEEN IN THE WHOLE FLAT
TIED UP IN A TABLE NAPKIN A SPECIAL SORT OF RICE PUDDING WITH RAISINS STUCK IN IT
A BIG TAVERN WHICH HAD ALWAYS AROUSED IN HIM A FEELING OF AVERSION EVEN OF FEAR WHEN HE WALKED BY IT WITH HIS FATHER THERE WAS ALWAYS A CROWD THERE
RECALL SOME SUCH LINES AS THESE
IN WHICH STOOD THE OLD WOMAN'S BED AND CHEST OF DRAWERS
AND FILLED WITH DETAILS SO DELICATE SO UNEXPECTEDLY BUT SO ARTISTICALLY CONSISTENT THAT THE DREAMER WERE HE AN ARTIST LIKE PUSHKIN OR TURGENEV EVEN
BUT NO WORDS NO EXCLAMATIONS COULD EXPRESS HIS AGITATION THE FEELING OF INTENSE REPULSION
THE FLOWERS ESPECIALLY CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION HE GAZED AT THEM LONGER THAN AT ANYTHING HE WAS MET TOO BY LUXURIOUS CARRIAGES AND BY MEN AND WOMEN ON HORSEBACK
IT'S SIMPLY PHYSICAL DERANGEMENT JUST A GLASS OF BEER A PIECE OF DRY BREAD
THAT'S WORTH KNOWING STRONG BOXES ALWAYS HAVE KEYS LIKE THAT
HE WOULD CREEP DOWN THE STAIRS LIKE A CAT AND SLIP OUT UNSEEN THIS EVENING
THE OLD WOMAN SAID DISTINCTLY STILL KEEPING HER INQUIRING EYES ON HIS FACE AND HERE
ALL TORN AND BESPATTERED BRIMLESS AND BENT ON ONE SIDE IN A MOST UNSEEMLY FASHION
HAD GONE OUT AT THE SAME TIME THEIR DEPARTURE LEFT THE ROOM QUIET AND RATHER EMPTY THE PERSONS STILL IN THE TAVERN WERE A MAN WHO APPEARED TO BE AN
THESE TWO ROOMS MADE UP THE WHOLE FLAT
HAD OVERTAKEN HIM I KNEW IT HE MUTTERED IN CONFUSION I THOUGHT SO
QUITE THE CONTRARY BUT FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN IN AN OVERSTRAINED IRRITABLE CONDITION
EXCEPTIONALLY HANDSOME ABOVE THE AVERAGE IN HEIGHT SLIM WELL BUILT WITH BEAUTIFUL DARK EYES AND DARK BROWN HAIR
FOR THIS BUSINESS ONE SHOULD BE AS LITTLE CONSPICUOUS AS POSSIBLE TRIFLES TRIFLES ARE WHAT MATTER WHY IT'S JUST SUCH TRIFLES
AND HE DREW OUT OF HIS POCKET AN OLD FASHIONED FLAT SILVER WATCH ON THE BACK OF WHICH WAS ENGRAVED A GLOBE THE CHAIN WAS OF STEEL BUT THE TIME IS UP FOR YOUR LAST PLEDGE
CAME OUT ON TO THE LESSER NEVA CROSSED THE BRIDGE AND TURNED TOWARDS THE ISLANDS THE GREENNESS AND FRESHNESS WERE AT FIRST RESTFUL
AND A HALF FOR THE MONTH IN ADVANCE BUT FOR THE TWO ROUBLES I LENT YOU BEFORE YOU OWE ME NOW TWENTY COPECKS ON THE SAME RECKONING IN ADVANCE
OF THE WOUNDED RECOVERED IN THE TIME OF HENRY THE THIRD OF ENGLAND
THEY WERE NOT HOT TO HAZARD SUCH DISASTER THEY DARED NOT CLOSE AN EYE DARED NOT SEE BETTER THAN THEIR MASTER SEEING THEM LACRYMOSE AND GLUM A LEECH CONSOLED THE WEEPERS HE SPREAD SMALL RAGS WITH LIQUID GUM
IN PURGATORY AY SAID THE OFFICER COLDLY
THE SECOND PERSON OF THE SECULAR TRINITY FLOP VERSUS SUDDENLY TO CHANGE ONE'S OPINIONS AND GO OVER TO ANOTHER PARTY THE MOST NOTABLE FLOP ON RECORD WAS THAT OF SAUL OF TARSUS

AMONG WORKING ARTISANS OF LONDON
AND AFTER THE REST OF US SHALL HAVE RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT OF ETERNAL OBLIVION HE WILL SIT UP TO WRITE A HISTORY OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION FORCE
HIS GRANDMOTHERLY HAND WAS WARMLY TUCKED IN THE SET SUN OF CIVILIZATION AND IN THE TWILIGHT HE PREPARES MAN'S EVENING MEAL OF MILK AND MORALITY AND TURNS DOWN THE COVERS OF THE UNIVERSAL GRAVE
THE FAIRIES ARE NOW BELIEVED BY NATURALIST TO BE EXTINCT THOUGH A CLERGYMAN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND SAW THREE NEAR COLCHESTER AS LATELY AS EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE WHILE PASSING THROUGH A PARK AFTER DINING WITH THE LORD OF THE MANOR

DISAPPEARED ABOUT THE SAME TIME BUT AFTERWARD RETURNED HE HAD SEEN THE ABDUCTION BEEN IN PURSUIT OF THE FAIRIES

N THIS LOOKS LIKE AN EASY WORD TO DEFINE BUT WHEN I CONSIDER THAT PIOUS AND LEARNED THEOLOGIANS HAVE SPENT LONG LIVES IN EXPLAINING IT AND WRITTEN LIBRARIES TO EXPLAIN THEIR EXPLANATIONS
REMARKED WITH TRULY ORIENTAL STOICISM THAT HE COULD STAND IT AS LONG AS THE FROGS AND THE JEWS COULD SO THE PROGRAMME WAS CHANGED THE FROG IS A DILIGENT SONGSTER HAVING A GOOD VOICE BUT NO EAR

A SHIP BIG ENOUGH TO CARRY TWO IN FAIR WEATHER BUT ONLY ONE IN FOUL THE SEA WAS CALM
TRYING TO IMITATE PETER'S CROW NO IT WASN'T JANE SAID GRAVELY
LONG IN COMING BUT THIS PROMISE SENT PETER AWAY QUITE GAY AGAIN
A BIG WOMAN HULLO WENDY HE SAID NOT NOTICING ANY DIFFERENCE FOR HE WAS THINKING CHIEFLY OF HIMSELF AND IN THE DIM LIGHT HER WHITE DRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NIGHTGOWN IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER FIRST HULLO PETER
WHAT WAS THE LAST THING PETER EVER SAID TO YOU THE LAST THING HE EVER SAID TO ME WAS JUST ALWAYS BE WAITING FOR ME AND THEN SOME NIGHT YOU WILL HEAR ME CROWING YES BUT ALAS HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT ME
IN TIME THEY COULD NOT EVEN FLY AFTER THEIR HATS WANT OF PRACTICE THEY CALLED IT BUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT WAS THAT THEY NO LONGER BELIEVED MICHAEL BELIEVED LONGER THAN THE OTHER BOYS
PETER CAME NEXT SPRING CLEANING AND THE STRANGE THING WAS THAT HE NEVER KNEW HE HAD MISSED A YEAR THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE GIRL WENDY EVER SAW HIM FOR A LITTLE LONGER SHE TRIED FOR HIS SAKE NOT TO HAVE GROWING PAINS
BECAUSE YOU SEE WHEN A NEW BABY LAUGHS FOR THE FIRST TIME A NEW FAIRY IS BORN AND AS THERE ARE ALWAYS NEW BABIES THERE ARE ALWAYS NEW FAIRIES THEY LIVE IN NESTS ON THE TOPS OF TREES AND THE MAUVE ONES ARE BOYS AND THE WHITE ONES ARE GIRLS AND THE BLUE ONES ARE JUST LITTLE SILLIES WHO ARE NOT SURE WHAT THEY ARE
FOR ALMOST THE ONLY TIME IN HIS LIFE THAT I KNOW OF PETER WAS AFRAID DON'T TURN UP THE LIGHT HE CRIED SHE LET HER HANDS PLAY IN THE HAIR OF THE TRAGIC BOY SHE WAS NOT A LITTLE GIRL HEART BROKEN ABOUT HIM
YOU HAVE MISSED A BIT INTERRUPTS JANE WHO NOW KNOWS THE STORY BETTER THAN HER MOTHER WHEN YOU SAW HIM SITTING ON THE FLOOR CRYING WHAT DID YOU SAY I SAT UP IN BED AND I SAID BOY WHY ARE YOU CRYING
SHE KNEW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY THAT HE HAD LET MANY SPRING CLEANING TIMES PASS I CAN'T COME SHE SAID APOLOGETICALLY I HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FLY I'LL SOON TEACH YOU AGAIN O PETER DON'T WASTE THE FAIRY DUST ON ME
OR PERHAPS WENDY ADMITS SHE DOES SEE SOMETHING I DO BELIEVE SHE SAYS THAT IT IS THIS NURSERY I DO BELIEVE IT IS SAYS JANE GO ON
JANE SAID AH YES MANY GIRLS HEAR IT WHEN THEY ARE SLEEPING BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD IT AWAKE LUCKY YOU SAID JANE AND THEN ONE NIGHT CAME THE TRAGEDY IT WAS THE SPRING OF THE YEAR
THEY ARE NOW EMBARKED ON THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN PETER FLEW IN LOOKING FOR HIS SHADOW
PERHAPS HE IS ILL MICHAEL SAID YOU KNOW HE IS NEVER ILL MICHAEL CAME CLOSE TO HER AND WHISPERED WITH A SHIVER PERHAPS THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON WENDY AND THEN WENDY WOULD HAVE CRIED IF MICHAEL HAD NOT BEEN CRYING
IT TURNED OUT THAT NOT ONE OF THEM THOUGHT HIM A CYPHER AND HE WAS ABSURDLY GRATIFIED AND SAID HE WOULD FIND SPACE FOR THEM ALL IN THE DRAWING ROOM IF THEY FITTED IN WE'LL FIT IN SIR THEY ASSURED HIM THEN FOLLOW THE LEADER HE CRIED GAILY
SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THRILLING TALKS WITH HIM ABOUT OLD TIMES BUT NEW ADVENTURES HAD CROWDED THE OLD ONES FROM HIS MIND WHO IS CAPTAIN HOOK
OF COURSE HE DID NOT STRIKE
AND THEN IT WAS WENDY'S PART TO PUT JANE TO BED THAT WAS THE TIME FOR STORIES IT WAS JANE'S INVENTION TO RAISE THE SHEET OVER HER MOTHER'S HEAD AND HER OWN THUS MAKING A TENT
VERY SOON I DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL AND LEARN SOLEMN THINGS HE TOLD HER PASSIONATELY I DON'T WANT TO BE A MAN O WENDY'S MOTHER IF I WAS TO WAKE UP AND FEEL THERE WAS A BEARD PETER SAID WENDY THE COMFORTER I SHOULD LOVE YOU IN A BEARD
YES I KNOW I CAME BACK FOR MY MOTHER HE EXPLAINED TO TAKE HER TO THE NEVERLAND YES I KNOW JANE SAID I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU WHEN WENDY RETURNED DIFFIDENTLY SHE FOUND PETER SITTING ON THE BED POST CROWING GLORIOUSLY
THAN A LITTLE DUST IN THE BOX IN WHICH SHE HAD KEPT HER TOYS WENDY WAS GROWN UP YOU NEED NOT BE SORRY FOR HER SHE WAS ONE OF THE KIND THAT LIKES TO GROW UP IN THE END SHE GREW UP OF HER OWN FREE WILL A DAY QUICKER THAN OTHER GIRLS
THE KISS THAT HAD BEEN FOR NO ONE ELSE PETER TOOK QUITE EASILY FUNNY BUT SHE SEEMED SATISFIED OF COURSE ALL THE BOYS WENT TO SCHOOL
FATHER WENDY CRIED SHOCKED BUT STILL THE CLOUD WAS ON HIM HE KNEW HE WAS BEHAVING UNWORTHILY BUT HE COULD NOT HELP IT WE COULD LIE DOUBLED UP SAID NIBS I ALWAYS CUT THEIR HAIR MYSELF SAID WENDY
WHILE JANE IN HER NIGHTY WAS FLYING ROUND THE ROOM IN SOLEMN ECSTASY SHE IS MY MOTHER PETER EXPLAINED AND JANE DESCENDED AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE WITH THE LOOK IN HER FACE THAT HE LIKED TO SEE ON LADIES WHEN THEY GAZED AT HIM
HE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVER AND WENDY SAW AT ONCE THAT HE STILL HAD ALL HIS FIRST TEETH HE WAS A LITTLE BOY AND SHE WAS GROWN UP SHE HUDDLED BY THE FIRE NOT DARING TO MOVE HELPLESS AND GUILTY
I DON'T THINK HE IS A CYPHER TOOTLES CRIED INSTANTLY DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER CURLY NO I DON'T DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER SLIGHTLY RATHER NOT TWIN WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU DON'T DO THINGS BY HALVES A GRUDGING REMARK WHICH THE TWINS THOUGHT WAS POINTED AT THEM THE FIRST TWIN WAS THE PROUD ONE AND HE ASKED FLUSHING DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO MUCH OF A HANDFUL SIR BECAUSE IF SO WE CAN GO AWAY
WHO IS TINKER BELL O PETER SHE SAID SHOCKED BUT EVEN WHEN SHE EXPLAINED HE COULD NOT REMEMBER THERE ARE SUCH A LOT OF THEM HE SAID I EXPECT SHE IS NO MORE I EXPECT HE WAS RIGHT FOR FAIRIES DON'T LIVE LONG
THEY WENT UP BY THE STAIR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE A BETTER IMPRESSION THEY STOOD IN A ROW IN FRONT OF MISSUS DARLING WITH THEIR HATS OFF AND WISHING THEY WERE NOT WEARING THEIR PIRATE CLOTHES THEY SAID NOTHING BUT THEIR EYES ASKED HER TO HAVE THEM
I DON'T THINK I SEE ANYTHING TO NIGHT SAYS WENDY WITH A FEELING THAT IF NANA WERE HERE SHE WOULD OBJECT TO FURTHER CONVERSATION YES YOU DO SAYS JANE

SO I TOLD DOT TO MAKE A NOISE IN THE HOPE OF FRIGHTENING THEM THE BITTERN WAS REALLY TOUCHED BY THE KANGAROO'S GRATITUDE AND WAS DELIGHTED AT BEING CALLED CLEVER SO IT BECAME STILL MORE UNGRACIOUS
AND NOT BONAPARTE WHEN ALLUDING TO THE LANDING AT CANNES THE ORDER FOR HIS ARREST WAS ACCORDINGLY DESPATCHED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
CAUSED ALL THAT WAS IN HIS SOUL TO APPEAR IN HIS COUNTENANCE THE DEPTHS HAVING BEEN STIRRED UP MOUNTED TO THE SURFACE THE HUMILIATION OF HAVING IN SOME SLIGHT DEGREE LOST THE SCENT AND OF HAVING INDULGED FOR A FEW MOMENTS
YOU HAVE MURDERED THAT WOMAN LET'S HAVE AN END OF THIS SHOUTED JAVERT IN A FURY I AM NOT HERE TO LISTEN TO ARGUMENT LET US ECONOMIZE ALL THAT THE GUARD IS BELOW MARCH ON INSTANTLY OR YOU'LL GET THE THUMB SCREWS
CHAPTER THREE JAVERT SATISFIED THIS IS WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE THE HALF HOUR AFTER MIDNIGHT HAD JUST STRUCK
AND WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIS AIR THE MOST ORDINARY IN THE WORLD HE WAS COOL CALM GRAVE HIS GRAY HAIR WAS PERFECTLY SMOOTH UPON HIS TEMPLES AND HE HAD JUST MOUNTED THE STAIRS WITH HIS HABITUAL DELIBERATION
ACCUSTOMED AS SHE WAS TO SEEING ARMED MEN INQUIRING FOR THE MAYOR ON ARRIVING AT FANTINE'S CHAMBER JAVERT TURNED THE HANDLE PUSHED THE DOOR OPEN WITH THE GENTLENESS OF A SICK NURSE OR A POLICE SPY AND ENTERED
PERSONIFIED JUSTICE LIGHT AND TRUTH IN THEIR CELESTIAL FUNCTION OF CRUSHING OUT EVIL BEHIND HIM AND AROUND HIM AT AN INFINITE DISTANCE HE HAD AUTHORITY REASON THE CASE JUDGED THE LEGAL CONSCIENCE
JAVERT WAS IN HEAVEN AT THAT MOMENT WITHOUT PUTTING THE THING CLEARLY TO HIMSELF BUT WITH A CONFUSED INTUITION OF THE NECESSITY OF HIS PRESENCE AND OF HIS SUCCESS
ANY ONE WHO WAS THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH HIM AND WHO HAD EXAMINED HIM ATTENTIVELY AT THE MOMENT WOULD HAVE SHUDDERED THE BUCKLE OF HIS LEATHER STOCK WAS UNDER HIS LEFT EAR INSTEAD OF AT THE NAPE OF HIS NECK THIS BETRAYED
BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY VERY KIND IN HELPING HER TO SAVE THE KANGAROO'S LIFE AND YET IT SEEMED TO DELIGHT IN SPOILING ITS KINDHEARTEDNESS BY ITS RUDENESS AFTERWARDS THE KANGAROO TOLD HER THAT THE LITTLE BITTERN IS A REALLY TENDER HEARTED FELLOW
THEY WERE PERCHED ON A ROCK AND THE MOONLIGHT LIT ALL THEIR SURROUNDINGS LIKE DAY TO THE RIGHT WAS A DEEP BLACK CHASM WITH A WHITE FOAMING WATERFALL POURING INTO THE DARKNESS BELOW IN FRONT WAS THE SAME WIDE CHASM
THE INSTANT THAT MADELEINE'S GLANCE ENCOUNTERED JAVERT'S GLANCE JAVERT WITHOUT STIRRING WITHOUT MOVING FROM HIS POST WITHOUT APPROACHING HIM BECAME TERRIBLE
HER TONGUE MOISTENED AND RETURNED TO THE MOUTH AND AT LAST DOT SAW WITH JOY THE BROWN EYES OPEN AND SHE KNEW THAT HER GOOD FRIEND WAS NOT GOING TO DIE BUT WOULD GET WELL AGAIN WHILST ALL THIS TOOK PLACE THE LITTLE BROWN BIRD STOOD ON ONE LEG
AND WITH WOLFISH GAIT AND SAVAGE SOUNDS WAS PRESSING TOWARDS THEIR PLACE OF OBSERVATION THE PANTING TREMBLING KANGAROO SAW THE APPROACHING DOG ALSO AND LEAPED DOWN FROM THE CRAG
JAVERT'S CONTENT SHONE FORTH IN HIS SOVEREIGN ATTITUDE THE DEFORMITY OF TRIUMPH OVERSPREAD THAT NARROW BROW ALL THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF HORROR WHICH A SATISFIED FACE CAN AFFORD WERE THERE
BE QUICK ABOUT IT HE SAID
TO BE DASHED TO PIECES ON THE ROCKS AND THE TREE TOPS
SHE RAISED HER POWERFUL LEG AND WITH THAT LONG STRONG CLAW TORE OPEN THE DOG'S BODY THE DOG YELPED IN PAIN AS THE KANGAROO THREW IT TO THE GROUND WHERE IT LAY ROLLING IN AGONY AND DYING FOR THE KANGAROO HAD GIVEN IT A TERRIBLE WOUND
HAD MADE A REQUISITION ON THE NEIGHBORING POST FOR A CORPORAL AND FOUR SOLDIERS HAD LEFT THE SOLDIERS IN THE COURTYARD HAD HAD FANTINE'S ROOM POINTED OUT TO HIM BY THE PORTRESS WHO WAS UTTERLY UNSUSPICIOUS
TO DECLARE THAT HIS CONVICTIONS HAD NOT BEEN IN THE LEAST MODIFIED BY THAT CURIOUS INCIDENT WHICH WOULD BE EXPLAINED THEREAFTER AND TO DEMAND IN THE MEANTIME THE CONDEMNATION OF THAT CHAMPMATHIEU
AND EARLY NEXT MORNING THE WHOLE TRIBE WENT AWAY BEING AFRAID TO REMAIN SO NEAR THE HAUNT OF THE DREADED BUNYIP DOT SAW THE FLIGHT OF THE BLACKS IN THE DIM DISTANCE AND TOLD THE GOOD NEWS TO THE KANGAROO WHO HOWEVER WAS TOO EXHAUSTED TO REJOICE AT THEIR ESCAPE
HERE THE POOR HUNTED CREATURE TOOK HER STAND WITH HER BACK CLOSE TO THE ROCK GENTLE AND TIMID AS SHE WAS AND UNFITTED BY NATURE TO FIGHT FOR HER LIFE AGAINST FIERCE ODDS IT WAS BRAVE INDEED OF THE POOR KANGAROO TO FACE HER ENEMIES
HE WAS RADIANT HE EXTERMINATED HE SMILED AND THERE WAS AN INCONTESTABLE GRANDEUR IN THIS MONSTROUS SAINT MICHAEL
AS SHE DROPPED TO EARTH SHE STOOPED AND QUICKLY LIFTED DOT OUT OF HER POUCH AND ALMOST BEFORE DOT COULD REALIZE THE MOVEMENT SHE FOUND HERSELF STANDING ALONE WHILST THE KANGAROO HOPPED FORWARD TO THE FRONT OF A BIG BOULDER AS IF TO MEET THE DOG
JEAN VALJEAN ARMED WITH HIS BAR OF IRON WALKED SLOWLY UP TO FANTINE'S COUCH WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE HE TURNED AND SAID TO JAVERT
AND THEN WHEN ALL WAS SAID ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT WAS A KINDLY AND A TOLERABLY INTELLIGENT MAN HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME A DEVOTED AND ALMOST AN ARDENT ROYALIST
AND THE MYSTERIOUS BELLOWING NOISE FOLLOWING THEM ON THE BREEZE AND THEY NEVER STOPPED RUNNING UNTIL THEY REGAINED THE LIGHT OF THEIR CAMP FIRES THERE THEY TOLD THE GINS IN AWE STRUCK VOICES
AND NOW THERE'S THE OTHER ONE WILL YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU HUSSY
THE MAJESTY PECULIAR TO THE HUMAN CONSCIENCE CLINGS TO THEM IN THE MIDST OF HORROR THEY ARE VIRTUES WHICH HAVE ONE VICE ERROR THE HONEST PITILESS JOY OF A FANATIC IN THE FULL FLOOD OF HIS ATROCITY
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME WHO SENT YOU HERE HE WENT ON HARSHLY AND WHY YOU CAME I NEVER SUSPECTED YOU I THOUGHT YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE STRANGE CREATURES ONE MEETS IN ENGLAND A GENTLEWOMAN WHO PREFERS WORKING FOR HER LIVING TO THE MORE SIMPLE BUSINESS OF GETTING MARRIED
AS HANS ONE EYE WANDERED AROUND THE BARE STONE SPACE HIS GLANCE FELL AT LAST UPON IT AND THERE IT RESTED
TIS YOU PASS UNDER PRINCESS FAIR IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO THEN SHE WENT ON HER WAY TILL SHE CAME TO THE COMMON WHERE SHE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO COMB OUT HER HAIR
THE NECKLACE SAID THE GIRL IN A FRIGHTENED WHISPER HANS THRUST IT INTO HER HAND IT'S THINE SAID HE AND NOW WILT THOU NOT HELP ME TO A TRADE I WILL TELL MY SISTER THAT THOU ART HERE SAID SHE
SHE EXAMINED THE ROOM CAREFULLY AT THE FARTHERMOST END WAS ANOTHER DOOR AND THIS SHE PUSHED GENTLY AT FIRST AND THEN VIGOROUSLY WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION SHE STILL HAD HER BAG A SMALL AFFAIR OF BLACK MOIRE WHICH HUNG FROM HER BELT
I FOR ONE SAY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE LEFT THERE TO DIE ALONE IN THAT BLACK CELL FRITZ THE SWINEHERD GAVE A GRUNT AT THIS WITHOUT RAISING HIS EYES FROM THE BOWL YES GOOD SAID KATHERINE I KNOW WHAT THOU MEANEST FRITZ
AS SHE AND CURDKEN WERE DRIVING THEIR FLOCK THROUGH THE GATE SHE SAID AS SHE PASSED UNDER OH FALADA TIS YOU HANG THERE AND THE HEAD REPLIED TIS YOU PASS UNDER PRINCESS FAIR IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO
WHEN SHE RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS SHE FOUND HERSELF LYING ON A PLAIN STRETCHER BED SHE SAT UP SUDDENLY
SHE SPRANG UP TOOK HER BAG FROM THE TABLE OPENED THE LITTLE PENKNIFE AND CUT CAREFULLY THROUGH THE THIN RUSHES SHE MIGHT HAVE TO REPLACE THE MATTING AND IT WAS NECESSARY SHE SHOULD DO HER WORK TIDILY SOON THE WHOLE OF THE TRAP WAS REVEALED
HE WAS ABREAST OF HER WHEN HE SUDDENLY SWUNG ROUND AND CATCHING HER IN HIS ARMS HE CAUGHT HER CLOSE TO HIM BEFORE SHE COULD REALISE WHAT HE PLANNED HE HAD STOOPED SWIFTLY AND KISSED HER FULL UPON THE MOUTH IF YOU SCREAM I SHALL KISS YOU AGAIN HE SAID
SHE WAS IN A CELLAR SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THAT ABOVE HER THE LIGHT SHE HAD SEEN CAME FROM AN INNER APARTMENT WHICH WOULD BE UNDERNEATH THE KITCHEN OF THE HOUSE SHE MADE HER WAY CAUTIOUSLY ALONG STEPPING ON TIP TOE THE FIRST OF THE ROOMS SHE CAME TO WAS WELL FURNISHED
SOMETHING WHICH IF SHE COULD RECOLLECT IT WOULD BE OF SERVICE TO HER THEN IN A FLASH SHE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS A LOWER CELLAR
AND HAD LEFT THUS STANDING IN THE COURT BELOW OH REPLIED THE BRIDE I BROUGHT HER WITH ME TO KEEP ME COMPANY ON THE JOURNEY
AND AWAY SHE RAN FROM THE LITTLE STONE HALLWAY CAREFULLY BOLTING AND LOCKING THE FURTHER DOOR BEHIND HER THE DOOR THAT THE GIRL HAD LOCKED WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT CONNECTED THE POSTERN HAIL WITH THE CASTLE THE ONE EYED HANS STOOD LOOKING AFTER HER
TILL MY LOCKS OF RUDDY GOLD NOW ASTRAY AND HANGING DOWN BE COMBED AND PLAITED IN A CROWN THEN A GUST OF WIND CAME AND BLEW CURDKEN'S HAT AWAY SO THAT HE HAD TO FLY OVER HILL AND DALE AFTER IT AND THE GIRL IN THE MEANTIME QUIETLY COMBED AND PLAITED HER HAIR
YOU ARE THE PERSON SAID THE KING AND YOU HAVE PASSED SENTENCE ON YOURSELF
SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED SAID THE GIRL COOLLY YOU MAY SEND FOR THE POLICE SHE LEANT BACK AGAINST THE EDGE OF THE DESK HER HANDS HOLDING THE EDGE AND FACED HIM WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A QUAVER I DO NOT LIKE THE POLICE
AND SECRETLY PROMISED HIM A PIECE OF GOLD IF HE WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR HER THERE WAS IN THE TOWN A LARGE DARK GATE THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD TO PASS NIGHT AND MORNING WITH THE GEESE WOULD HE KINDLY HANG UP FALADA'S HEAD THERE THAT SHE MIGHT SEE IT ONCE AGAIN
AND SET FORTH ON THE JOURNEY TO HER BRIDEGROOM'S KINGDOM AFTER THEY HAD RIDDEN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO FEEL VERY THIRSTY AND SAID TO HER WAITING MAID PRAY GET DOWN AND FETCH ME SOME WATER IN MY GOLDEN CUP OUT OF YONDER STREAM I WOULD LIKE A DRINK
EVEN THOUGH MY STAY BE AT THE DANGER OF MY OWN HIDE
AND SHE MADE AS IF SHE WOULD CLAP TO THE LITTLE WINDOW IN HIS FACE BUT THE ONE EYED HANS THRUST HIS STAFF BETWIXT THE BARS AND SO KEPT THE SHUTTER OPEN
IF I HAD YOU ARRESTED YOUR NAME WOULD APPEAR IN ALL THE PAPERS OF COURSE HE SAID NARROWLY AND YOUR PHOTOGRAPH WOULD PROBABLY ADORN THE SUNDAY JOURNALS HE ADDED EXPECTANTLY SHE LAUGHED
HUNG A GORGEOUS FILIGREE CROSS DIDST THOU EVER SEE A SWEETER THING THAN THIS SAID HE AND LOOK
HE SETTLED THE CAP MORE FIRMLY UPON HIS HEAD SPAT UPON HIS HANDS AND ONCE MORE STOOPING IN THE FIREPLACE GAVE A LEAP AND UP THE CHIMNEY HE WENT WITH A RATTLE OF LOOSE MORTAR AND A BLACK TRICKLE OF SOOT
AND THE REAL BRIDE WAS MADE TO ASSIST HIM IN HERDING GEESE SOON AFTER THIS THE FALSE BRIDE SAID TO THE PRINCE DEAREST HUSBAND I PRAY YOU GRANT ME A FAVOR HE ANSWERED THAT I WILL
WHEN SHE WISHED TO GET ON HER HORSE FALADA AGAIN THE WAITING MAID CALLED OUT I MEAN TO RIDE FALADA
THOU HADST BEST GET AWAY FROM HERE POOR SOUL AS FAST AS THY LEGS CAN CARRY THEE FOR IF THE LORD BARON SHOULD FIND THEE HERE TALKING SECRETLY AT THE POSTERN DOOR HE WOULD LOOSE THE WOLF HOUNDS UPON THEE PRUT SAID ONE EYED HANS WITH A GRIN
AND HE PROCEEDED TO RELATE ALL HER INIQUITIES AND SAID EVERY MORNING AS WE DRIVE THE FLOCK THROUGH THE DARK GATE SHE SAYS TO A HORSE'S HEAD THAT HANGS ON THE WALL
NAY SAID KATHERINE
NEVERTHELESS HE PERSISTED
THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING OVER THE ARRIVAL AND THE PRINCE SPRANG FORWARD TO MEET THEM AND TAKING THE WAITING MAID FOR HIS BRIDE HE LIFTED HER DOWN FROM HER HORSE AND LED HER UPSTAIRS TO THE ROYAL CHAMBER IN THE MEANTIME THE REAL PRINCESS WAS LEFT STANDING BELOW IN THE COURTYARD
AT LAST HE SAID WELL IF YOU WON'T TELL ME CONFIDE YOUR TROUBLE TO THE IRON STOVE THERE AND HE WENT AWAY THEN SHE CREPT TO THE STOVE AND BEGAN TO SOB AND CRY AND TO POUR OUT HER POOR LITTLE HEART AND SAID HERE I SIT DESERTED BY ALL THE WORLD
I WHO AM A KING'S DAUGHTER AND A FALSE WAITING MAID HAS FORCED ME TO TAKE OFF MY OWN CLOTHES AND HAS TAKEN MY PLACE WITH MY BRIDEGROOM WHILE I HAVE TO FULFILL THE LOWLY OFFICE OF GOOSE GIRL IF MY MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO
I LENT YOU MY HORSE MY DINNER YE HAVE EATEN
DICK SAID MATCHAM IT MAY NOT BE I CAN NO MORE

TO HAVE A RIDING ROD AND SPURS AND NEVER A HORSE TO SIT UPON AND BEFORE ALL HE ADDED LOOKING RUEFULLY UPON HIS CLOTHES BEFORE ALL TO BE SO SORRILY BESMIRCHED TUT CRIED DICK WOULD YE MIND A DUCKING
DICK HAD BEEN ORDERED HITHER AND THITHER ONE COMMAND FOLLOWING ANOTHER TILL HE WAS BEWILDERED WITH THE NUMBER AND THE HURRY OF COMMISSIONS ALL THAT TIME HE HAD SEEN NO MORE OF SIR OLIVER AND NOTHING OF MATCHAM AND YET BOTH THE PRIEST AND THE YOUNG LAD RAN CONTINUALLY IN HIS MIND

HE WAS AS WHITE AS A SHEET BUT HE LOOKED DICK STEADILY IN THE FACE AND NEVER MOVED DICK TOOK A STEP SWINGING THE BELT THEN HE PAUSED
HE STOOD WAVERING AND BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO COME TO HIMSELF DICK BOUNDED AT HIS THROAT AND SENT HIM SPRAWLING BACKWARD ON THE TURF
AND IF ONLY I COULD LIVE I WOULD MARRY YOU BLITHELY AND LIVE OR DIE I LOVE YOU SHE ANSWERED NOTHING COME HE SAID SPEAK UP JACK COME BE A GOOD MAID AND SAY YE LOVE ME WHY DICK SHE CRIED WOULD I BE HERE
AND IT IS I METHINKS THAT AM UNHORSED ALACK I SHALL BE TAKEN CRIED THE FUGITIVE DICK KIND DICK
HERE BE NONE TO TROUBLE YOU NAY GOOD BOY I HAVE NO ARMS NOR SKILL TO USE THEM IF I HAD REPLIED THE OTHER STEPPING FORTH UPON THE PATHWAY WHY CALL ME BOY CRIED DICK
AND HE MADE READY HIS CROSSBOW AND PUT A QUARREL THROUGH THE CREATURE'S HEAD DICK RODE ON AFTER THIS ACT OF RUGGED MERCY SOMEWHAT SOBERED IN SPIRIT AND LOOKING CLOSELY ABOUT HIM FOR ANY SIGN OF HIS LESS HAPPY PREDECESSOR IN THE WAY
WITHOUT ANY MORE WORDS HE BEGAN TO WALK FORWARD AND THE OTHER ONCE MORE FOLLOWED HIM THE BLACKNESS GREW THICKER AND THICKER ONLY HERE AND THERE IN OPEN PLACES THEY SAW THE SKY DOTTED WITH SMALL STARS IN THE DISTANCE
FOR A WITCH'S SPIRIT DICK CRIED BUT PRAY FOR HER AN YE LIST SHE WAS THE BEST WENCH IN EUROPE WAS THIS JOAN OF ARC OLD APPLEYARD THE ARCHER RAN FROM HER HE SAID AS IF SHE HAD BEEN MAHOUN NAY SHE WAS A BRAVE WENCH
AND SIR DANIEL AND HIS MEN DESISTING INSTANTLY FROM THEIR ATTACK UPON DICK'S CHAMBER HURRIED TO DEFEND THE WALLS NOW CRIED DICK WE ARE SAVED HE SEIZED THE GREAT OLD BEDSTEAD WITH BOTH HANDS AND BENT HIMSELF IN VAIN TO MOVE IT HELP ME JACK
WELL SEE YE HERE CONTINUED DICK AN WE BUT ESCAPE WHOLE WE'LL MARRY AND AN WE'RE TO DIE WE DIE AND THERE'S AN END ON'T BUT NOW THAT I THINK HOW FOUND YE MY CHAMBER I ASKED IT OF DAME HATCH SHE ANSWERED
ON EITHER HAND THERE WERE GREAT FIELDS OF BLOWING REEDS AND WILLOWS POOLS OF WATER SHAKING IN THE WIND AND TREACHEROUS BOGS AS GREEN AS EMERALD TO TEMPT AND TO BETRAY THE TRAVELLER THE PATH LAY ALMOST STRAIGHT THROUGH THE MORASS
SO THEN THEY SEPARATED FOR THE SECOND TIME AND PRESENTLY IT WAS DICK WHO WAS RUNNING AFTER MATCHAM HERE HE SAID TAKE MY CROSS BOW SHALT NOT GO UNARMED A CROSS BOW SAID MATCHAM NAY BOY

ONE LOOK BACKWARD TO WHERE THE WINDMILL SAILS WERE TURNING BLACK AGAINST THE BLUE OF HEAVEN ONE LOOK FORWARD TO THE HIGH GROUND OF TUNSTALL FOREST AND HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY DIRECTED AND HELD STRAIGHT ON THE WATER WASHING TO HIS HORSE'S KNEES AS SAFE AS ON A HIGHWAY HALF WAY ACROSS
HIS COURAGE BEGAN TO SUBSIDE SAY YE WERE IN THE WRONG THEN HE SAID LAMELY NAY SAID MATCHAM I WAS IN THE RIGHT COME CRUEL I BE LAME I BE WEARY I RESIST NOT I NE'ER DID THEE HURT COME BEAT ME COWARD
NAY THERE SHALL COME A DAY BETWEEN US HE SHALL SMART FOR ALL WOULD YE SHOOT AT THE MOON WITH A HAND GUN SAID DICK TIS A VALIANT KNIGHT AND HATH A HAND OF IRON AN HE GUESSED I HAD MADE OR MEDDLED WITH YOUR FLIGHT IT WOULD GO SORE WITH ME
WHICH THEY HAD CROSSED AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE THE GREAT BULK OF THEIR PURSUERS WERE LEANING TO THE OTHER HAND AND RUNNING TOWARDS TUNSTALL THE LADS PAUSED TO BREATHE THERE WAS NO SOUND OF PURSUIT DICK PUT HIS EAR TO THE GROUND
BUT WHEN IT WAS TO SAVE MEN'S LIVES YOUR HEART WAS HARD ENOUGH SAID DICK CONTEMPTUOUSLY
FORGIVE ME NOW SWEET DICK NAY NO FOOL WORDS RETURNED DICK
ALACK THOUGHT DICK CAN THE POOR LAD HAVE PERISHED THERE IS HIS HORSE FOR CERTAIN A BRAVE GREY NAY COMRADE IF THOU CRIEST TO ME SO PITEOUSLY I WILL DO ALL MAN CAN TO HELP THEE SHALT NOT LIE THERE TO DROWN BY INCHES

I HAVE NEITHER THE STRENGTH TO BEND NOR YET THE SKILL TO AIM WITH IT IT WERE NO HELP TO ME GOOD BOY BUT YET I THANK YOU THE NIGHT HAD NOW FALLEN AND UNDER THE TREES THEY COULD NO LONGER READ EACH OTHER'S FACE
THE TUCKET SOUNDETH AY SAID MATCHAM
YOU MUST BE RIGHT I SAID AT LENGTH LOOKING WOEFULLY UP AT HER YES I KNEW I WAS SHE SAID STEADILY I MUST HAVE LOST IT YES
AND WHEN THE CHILDREN TRIED TO PULL IT OFF IT NEARLY KILLED HIM WITH PAIN FOR IT TOOK ALL THE LITTLE FINE HAIRS OF HIS COAT WITH IT THE WINDOW OF THE BATHROOM WAS OPEN AND THE DOCTOR COMING OUT ON HIS FRONT PORCH TO LOOK AT THE SKY BEFORE RETIRING
I IN BEING THE RECIPIENT OF SUCH UNTOLD BENEFITS THROUGH HIS VALUABLE DISCOVERY AT LAST THE DOCTOR CHANCED TO SAY THAT HE WONDERED HOW I HAPPENED TO GET HIS PILLS IN NATCHEZ
BRANDRETH'S PILLS SPECIALLY RECOMMENDED TO PURIFY THE BLOOD HIS OFFICE CONSISTED OF A ROOM ABOUT TEN FEET SQUARE LOCATED IN WHAT WAS THEN KNOWN AS THE SUN BUILDING
AND TOLD THE DOCTOR THAT AFTER ALL IT SEEMED THE COUNTERFEITS WERE AS GOOD AS THE REAL PILLS PROVIDED THE PATIENT HAD SUFFICIENT FAITH THE DOCTOR WAS PUZZLED AS WELL AS VEXED BUT AN IDEA STRUCK HIM THAT SOON ENABLED HIM TO RECOVER HIS USUAL EQUANIMITY
I WAS SURE FROM THE VERY WHISPER IN WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN THAT THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD HE WANTED WAS TO HAVE THAT AGREEMENT MADE PUBLIC BY MY ARREST BUT I TRIPPED UP ON ONE THING I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A MIDDLE WAY FOR A MAN WITH MONEY
HE SAID EAGERLY A A CONTRACT JUST A SINGLE SHEET OF LEGAL CAP PAPER IT WAS TYPE WRITTEN AND SIGNED BY MYSELF AND SOME OTHER GENTLEMEN AND FOLDED TWICE THE WOMAN LOOKED AT ME SHE WAS A BIT HARD MOUTHED WITH IRON GRAY HAIR
WHOSE LIFE GIVING POWER NO PEN CAN DESCRIBE
I GRINNED RIGHT UP AT HIM SO LONG AS IT DIDN'T HURT ME MYSELF IN THE EYES OF THE LAW MAD OH HE WAS HOPPING A GERMAN SWEAR WORD BURST FROM HIM I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT BUT I CAN IMAGINE
A FUNNY INCIDENT OCCURRED TO ME IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GREAT PILL IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX WHILE I WAS TRAVELLING THROUGH THE STATES OF ALABAMA MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA I BECAME CONVINCED BY READING DOCTOR BRANDRETH'S ADVERTISEMENTS THAT I NEEDED HIS PILLS
THE INGENUITY DISPLAYED IN CONCOCTING THESE ADVERTISEMENTS WAS SUPERB AND WAS PROBABLY HARDLY EQUALED BY THAT REQUIRED TO CONCOCT THE PILLS NO PAIN ACHE TWINGE OR OTHER SENSATION GOOD BAD OR INDIFFERENT
I SUPPOSE THIS MAY BE TRUE AT ALL EVENTS NO LIVING MAN WILL BE APT TO TESTIFY TO THE CONTRARY HERE IS AN EXTRACT FROM ONE OF DOCTOR BRANDRETH'S EARLY ADVERTISEMENTS WHICH WILL GIVE AN IDEA OF HIS STYLE
OH I WAS SWEET AMIABILITY PERSONIFIED WITH THE WOMAN AND WITH THE SERGEANT WHO BEGAN TO BACK WATER FURIOUSLY BUT WITH TAUSIG WHAT YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU'RE NOT ON MAG
WITH THE WORRIED TABBY CLOSE AT HIS HEELS THE DOCTOR MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE HOUSE AND STABLE YARD BUT COULD FIND NO ZIP THE HOWLS SEEMED TO COME FROM UP IN THE AIR SOMEWHERE AS FROM THE TOP OF THE HOUSE
HEARD ZIP HOWLING SOMEWHERE ACROSS THE STREET HE WAS CRYING IN SUCH A PITIFUL FRIGHTENED MANNER THAT THE DOCTOR KNEW HE MUST BE FAST SOMEWHERE OR HURT SO HE COULD NOT GET HOME
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY I EXCLAIMED WHY I CERTAINLY YOU CERTAINLY HAD NO PURSE FOR I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT AND SEARCHED IT IF YOU HAD NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK OF A WOMAN LIKE THAT
THE LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS GIVING THE PARTY LET'S PUT HIM IN THE BATH TUB AND SOAK IT OFF JUST THE VERY THING ONE OF THE BOYS REPLIED WAIT TILL I GET SOMETHING TO WRAP HIM IN SO I WON'T GET ALL STUCK UP WITH THE CANDY
A FEW FEET FROM THE DOOR WAS THE MAID SITTING WITH LIMBS OUTSPREAD TOO DAZED TO MOVE WHILE FROM UNDER THE CORNER OF HER SKIRT ROLLED A BIG STICKY BALL OF SOME KIND THAT HOWLED AS IT ROLLED
FOR FOR THE SAKE OF MY REPUTATION I SUGGESTED SOFTLY YES HE LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT ME MISTRUSTING THE AMIABLE DEFERENCE OF MY MANNER THAT WOULD BE AWFULLY GOOD OF YOU
AND HAD BECOME THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THE ONLY REAL GREENHORNS IN THE WORLD WERE THOSE WHO PREFERRED MEAT OR BREAD TO BRANDRETH'S PILLS I TOOK THEM MORNING NOON AND NIGHT IN FACT THE ADVERTISEMENTS ANNOUNCED THAT ONE COULD NOT TAKE TOO MANY
AND I HAVEN'T CHANGED MY DRESS YET YOU'LL CHANGE IT ALL RIGHT FOR SOMETHING NOT SO BECOMING IF YOU DON'T SHELL OUT THAT PAPER PAPER YES PAPER LOOK HERE IF YOU GIVE IT BACK TO ME THIS MINUTE NOW I'LL NOT PROSECUTE YOU FOR
THAT IF THERE'S NOT ALWAYS FIRE WHERE THERE IS SMOKE IT'S BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S BEEN CLEVER ENOUGH AND QUICK ENOUGH TO COVER THE BLAZE WELL GOOD BY I SAID PUTTING OUT MY HAND IT'S BEEN DISAGREEABLE BUT I'M OBLIGED TO YOU FOR
STILL HE WAS ELATED IN HAVING ANOTHER WITNESS WHOSE EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS WITH HIS PILLS WERE SO EMINENTLY SATISFACTORY THE DOCTOR AND MYSELF WERE BOTH HAPPY HE IN BEING ABLE TO DO SO MUCH GOOD TO MANKIND
DID YOU FIND A BABY TOO DID I FIND HE GLARED AT ME I FIND YOU THAT'S ENOUGH NOW BUT THE LUNCHEON WAS TO BE AT TWELVE THIRTY I LAUGHED
AND THEN PERHAPS I CAN SNEAK INTO THE KITCHEN AND STEAL A PIECE OF CAKE THOUGHT ZIP BUT ALAS HE WAS SO BUSY GAZING UP AT THE LIGHTED WINDOWS TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THE HOUSE THAT HE NEGLECTED TO LOOK WHERE HE WAS STEPPING
POISONOUS COMPOUNDS I NEVER SELL A PILL TO A DRUGGIST I NEVER PERMIT AN APOTHECARY TO HANDLE ONE OF MY PILLS BUT THEY COUNTERFEIT THEM BY THE BUSHEL THE UNPRINCIPLED HEARTLESS MURDEROUS IMPOSTORS
THE PILLS WERE GENUINE AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD ADVERTISED THAT NO DRUGGIST SHOULD SELL THEM THEY WERE SO POPULAR THAT DRUGGISTS FOUND IT NECESSARY TO GET THEM BY HOOK OR BY CROOK AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS I HAD THE PLEASURE OF A GLORIOUS LAUGH
YOU SMILE BUT WHY DO YOU LOOK SO LIVELY AND INTERESTED WHEN I TALK ABOUT HER
BUT I DO SAID HER COUSIN SHUDDERING DON'T PROVOKE HIM AGAINST ME CATHERINE FOR HE IS VERY HARD IS HE SEVERE TO YOU MASTER HEATHCLIFF I INQUIRED
HE HARPED ON THE CRUEL OBLIGATION OF BEING HELD ASUNDER FROM HIS FRIEND AND LOVE AND GENTLY INTIMATED THAT MISTER LINTON MUST ALLOW AN INTERVIEW SOON OR HE SHOULD FEAR HE WAS PURPOSELY DECEIVING HIM WITH EMPTY PROMISES
DARLING I'D RATHER RESIGN HER TO GOD AND LAY HER IN THE EARTH BEFORE ME RESIGN HER TO GOD AS IT IS SIR I ANSWERED AND IF WE SHOULD LOSE YOU
AND DOOMED TO SOLITUDE OR THE SOCIETY OF THOSE WHO NEVER DID AND NEVER WILL LIKE ME HOW CAN I BE CHEERFUL AND WELL EDGAR THOUGH HE FELT FOR THE BOY COULD NOT CONSENT TO GRANT HIS REQUEST
BUT AM I NEVER TO SEE HER BECAUSE MY FATHER FORBIDS ME TO GO TO HER HOME AND YOU FORBID HER TO COME TO MINE DO NOW AND THEN RIDE WITH HER TOWARDS THE HEIGHTS
WE FOUND HE HAD NO HORSE AND WE WERE FORCED TO DISMOUNT AND LEAVE OURS TO GRAZE HE LAY ON THE HEATH AWAITING OUR APPROACH AND DID NOT RISE TILL WE CAME WITHIN A FEW YARDS
IT IS NICER THAN SUNSHINE NEXT WEEK IF YOU CAN WE'LL RIDE DOWN TO THE GRANGE PARK AND TRY MINE LINTON DID NOT APPEAR TO REMEMBER WHAT SHE TALKED OF
I SHOULD BE AMUSING A STRANGER TO THE FAMILY WITH RELATING THEM YET WHO KNOWS HOW LONG YOU'LL BE A STRANGER YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO REST ALWAYS CONTENTED LIVING BY YOURSELF AND I SOME WAY FANCY NO ONE COULD SEE CATHERINE LINTON AND NOT LOVE HER
REPELLING CONSOLATION AND READY TO REGARD THE GOOD HUMOURED MIRTH OF OTHERS AS AN INSULT CATHERINE PERCEIVED AS WELL AS I DID THAT HE HELD IT RATHER A PUNISHMENT THAN A GRATIFICATION TO ENDURE OUR COMPANY
MASTER HEATHCLIFF YOU ARE NOT FIT FOR ENJOYING A RAMBLE THIS MORNING HOW ILL YOU DO LOOK CATHERINE SURVEYED HIM WITH GRIEF AND ASTONISHMENT SHE CHANGED THE EJACULATION OF JOY ON HER LIPS TO ONE OF ALARM
HER AFFECTION FOR HIM WAS STILL THE CHIEF SENTIMENT IN HER HEART AND HE SPOKE WITHOUT ANGER HE SPOKE IN THE DEEP TENDERNESS OF ONE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIS TREASURE AMID PERILS AND FOES WHERE HIS REMEMBERED WORDS WOULD BE THE ONLY AID
HIS LACK OF INTEREST IN THE SUBJECTS SHE STARTED AND HIS EQUAL INCAPACITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO HER ENTERTAINMENT WERE SO OBVIOUS THAT SHE COULD NOT CONCEAL HER DISAPPOINTMENT AN INDEFINITE ALTERATION HAD COME OVER HIS WHOLE PERSON AND MANNER
CATHY BEGAN TO SEEK SOLACE IN LOOKING FOR BILBERRIES AND SHARING THE PRODUCE OF HER RESEARCHES WITH ME SHE DID NOT OFFER THEM TO HIM FOR SHE SAW FURTHER NOTICE WOULD ONLY WEARY AND ANNOY
AND PROBABLY HIS OWN HEATHCLIFF KNEW HE COULD PLEAD ELOQUENTLY FOR CATHERINE'S COMPANY THEN I DO NOT ASK HE SAID THAT SHE MAY VISIT HERE
WOULD BE LESS SWEET THAN THE ANTICIPATION THAT I WAS SOON IN A FEW MONTHS OR POSSIBLY WEEKS TO BE CARRIED UP AND LAID IN ITS LONELY HOLLOW ELLEN I'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH MY LITTLE CATHY
WE MUST NOT LEAVE HIM ASLEEP I ANSWERED WAIT TILL HE WAKES AND BE PATIENT YOU WERE MIGHTY EAGER TO SET OFF BUT YOUR LONGING TO SEE POOR LINTON HAS SOON EVAPORATED WHY DID HE WISH TO SEE ME RETURNED CATHERINE
OUR EXCURSION SHALL LIE TOWARDS HOME BUT WHEN WE REACHED HIM
WHICH MAY HE FORBID UNDER HIS PROVIDENCE I'LL STAND HER FRIEND AND COUNSELLOR TO THE LAST MISS CATHERINE IS A GOOD GIRL I DON'T FEAR THAT SHE WILL GO WILFULLY WRONG AND PEOPLE WHO DO THEIR DUTY ARE ALWAYS FINALLY REWARDED
AND WHY STOP MY GOOD FRIEND I CRIED IT MAY BE VERY POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULD LOVE HER BUT WOULD SHE LOVE ME I DOUBT IT TOO MUCH TO VENTURE MY TRANQUILLITY BY RUNNING INTO TEMPTATION
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THESE THINGS HAPPENED LAST WINTER SIR SAID MISSUS DEAN HARDLY MORE THAN A YEAR AGO LAST WINTER I DID NOT THINK AT ANOTHER TWELVE MONTHS END
THOUGH I'LL MENTION IT TO NOBODY BUT YOU NOT THAT I STAND IN AWE OF MISTER HEATHCLIFF HUSH MURMURED LINTON FOR GOD'S SAKE HUSH HE'S COMING AND HE CLUNG TO CATHERINE'S ARM
THE HOUSE OF HER ANCESTORS AND HE CONSIDERED HER ONLY PROSPECT OF DOING THAT WAS BY A UNION WITH HIS HEIR HE HAD NO IDEA THAT THE LATTER WAS FAILING ALMOST AS FAST AS HIMSELF NOR HAD ANY ONE I BELIEVE
I'D NOT CARE THAT HEATHCLIFF GAINED HIS ENDS AND TRIUMPHED IN ROBBING ME OF MY LAST BLESSING BUT SHOULD LINTON BE UNWORTHY ONLY A FEEBLE TOOL TO HIS FATHER I CANNOT ABANDON HER TO HIM AND
I CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW YOU MANAGE TO DOZE OUT OF DOORS IN THE MORNING I THOUGHT I HEARD MY FATHER HE GASPED GLANCING UP TO THE FROWNING NAB ABOVE US YOU ARE SURE NOBODY SPOKE
I'VE PRAYED OFTEN HE HALF SOLILOQUISED FOR THE APPROACH OF WHAT IS COMING AND NOW I BEGIN TO SHRINK AND FEAR IT I THOUGHT THE MEMORY OF THE HOUR I CAME DOWN THAT GLEN A BRIDEGROOM
FOR FEAR HIS FATHER SHOULD SCOLD HIM BUT I'M HARDLY GOING TO COME TO GIVE MISTER HEATHCLIFF PLEASURE WHATEVER REASON HE MAY HAVE FOR ORDERING LINTON TO UNDERGO THIS PENANCE
IS IT HALF AN HOUR NOW ELLEN SHE WHISPERED IN MY EAR AT LAST I CAN'T TELL WHY WE SHOULD STAY HE'S ASLEEP AND PAPA WILL BE WANTING US BACK WELL
SHE PLAYED THE GIRL UNTIL HE COULD REBUILD HIS FORTRESS AND HIDE HIS SOUL FROM THE WORLD WHEN THE BUTLER CAME TO CLEAR AWAY HENRY WAS IN A VERY DIFFERENT MOOD ASKED THE FELLOW WHAT HE WAS IN SUCH A HURRY FOR COMPLAINED OF THE NOISE LAST NIGHT IN THE SERVANTS HALL
SHE MURMURED STOOPING OVER THE MOWING MACHINE AND PLAYING WITH THE GRASS WHICH TRICKLED THROUGH HER FINGERS LIKE SAND HE HAD SILENCED HER BUT HER FEARS MADE HIM UNEASY
IN THE SOLEMN CALM OF THE AWAKENING MORN THAT NOTE WAS HEARD BY GABRIEL BEATING WITH UNUSUAL VIOLENCE AND RAPIDITY THIS EXCEPTIONAL RINGING MAY BE CAUSED IN TWO WAYS
CHARLES TOOK HIM OUT INTO THE GARDEN AND THEY PACED UP AND DOWN IN THEIR DRESSING GOWNS CHARLES BECAME VERY QUIET AS THE STORY UNROLLED HE HAD KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT MARGARET WAS AS BAD AS HER SISTER
CHARLES AND EVIE HAD NOT HEARD IT AND NEVER MUST HEAR NO MORE MUST PAUL OVER HIS CHILDREN HE FELT GREAT TENDERNESS WHICH HE DID NOT TRY TO TRACK TO A CAUSE MISSUS WILCOX WAS TOO FAR BACK IN HIS LIFE
FROM WHICH CHALK HAD BEEN DRAWN FOR GENERATIONS AND SPREAD OVER ADJACENT FARMS TWO HEDGES CONVERGED UPON IT IN THE FORM OF A V BUT WITHOUT QUITE MEETING THE NARROW OPENING LEFT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY OVER THE BROW OF THE PIT
THE LESS ABSOLUTE ITS CHARACTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THAT THERE IS NO REGULAR PATH FOR GETTING OUT OF LOVE AS THERE IS FOR GETTING IN SOME PEOPLE LOOK UPON MARRIAGE AS A SHORT CUT THAT WAY BUT IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO FAIL SEPARATION
LEAVING ONLY THE LAST FIVE MINUTES UNROLLED GLANCING AT THESE HE SAW THAT THE CAR WOULD BE ROUND DURING THE NEXT FIVE AND PLUNGED INTO ACTION GONGS WERE TAPPED ORDERS ISSUED
SHE COULD EVEN SEE THE BATHING SHED BUT WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING FOR CHARLES'S NEW SPRINGBOARD THE FOREHEAD OF THE HILL ROSE UP AND HID THE WHOLE SCENE SHE NEVER SAW IT AGAIN DAY AND NIGHT THE RIVER FLOWS DOWN INTO ENGLAND
I HAVE TOLD YOU TOO MUCH ALREADY FOR YOU TO FORGIVE ME NOW YES THAT'S ENOUGH DEAR I HAVE HE LOWERED HIS VOICE I HAVE BEEN THROUGH HELL GRAVELY SHE CONSIDERED THIS CLAIM HAD HE
A HEAP OF TWO HUNDRED MANGLED CARCASSES REPRESENTING IN THEIR CONDITION JUST NOW AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED MORE OAK WAS AN INTENSELY HUMANE MAN INDEED HIS HUMANITY OFTEN TORE IN PIECES ANY POLITIC INTENTIONS OF HIS WHICH BORDERED ON STRATEGY
WHAT MAN I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT HIS NAME WAS BAST MY GOD IS IT POSSIBLE SAID MISTER WILCOX IN YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE CHARLES IN YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE I KNOW PATER
SHE WILL FEEL DIFFERENTLY IN THE MORNING SAID MISTER WILCOX WHO HAD OF COURSE SAID NOTHING ABOUT MISSUS BAST BUT I CANNOT LET THIS KIND OF THING CONTINUE WITHOUT COMMENT I AM MORALLY CERTAIN THAT SHE IS WITH HER SISTER AT HOWARDS END
UNDOUBTEDLY SAID CHARLES MISTER WILCOX LINKED HIS ARM IN HIS SON'S BUT SOMEHOW LIKED HIM LESS AS HE TOLD HIM MORE
THE MORNING STAR DOGGING HER ON THE LEFT HAND THE POOL GLITTERED LIKE A DEAD MAN'S EYE AND AS THE WORLD AWOKE A BREEZE BLEW SHAKING AND ELONGATING THE REFLECTION OF THE MOON WITHOUT BREAKING IT
MARGARET FLUSHED AT ADVICE SO ELEMENTARY BUT HE WAS REALLY PAVING THE WAY FOR A LIE IF NECESSARY HE WOULD DENY THAT HE HAD EVER KNOWN MISSUS BAST AND PROSECUTE HER FOR LIBEL PERHAPS HE NEVER HAD KNOWN HER
MARGARET HAD HEARD A CERTAIN RUMOUR BUT WAS ALL RIGHT
YES YES HENRY I AM FAR FROM A SAINT IN FACT THE REVERSE BUT YOU HAVE
THERE WAS A PETULANT TOUCH ABOUT HIM MORE LIKE A WOMAN COULD IT BE THAT HE WAS GROWING OLD THE WILCOXES WERE NOT LACKING IN AFFECTION THEY HAD IT ROYALLY BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO USE IT IT WAS THE TALENT IN THE NAPKIN AND
FLOWS DEEP AND LONG OAK BELONGED TO THE EVEN TEMPERED ORDER OF HUMANITY AND FELT THE SECRET FUSION OF HIMSELF IN BATHSHEBA TO BE BURNING WITH A FINER FLAME NOW THAT SHE WAS GONE THAT WAS ALL
AND D YE COME IN THAT HE KNEW TO A HAIR'S BREADTH THE RATE OF TROTTING BACK FROM THE EWES TAILS THAT EACH CALL INVOLVED IF A STAGGERER WITH THE SHEEP CROOK WAS TO BE ESCAPED
MARGARET A PROMISE IS A PROMISE NEVER MENTION THAT WOMAN AGAIN EXCEPT FOR SOME PRACTICAL REASON NEVER PRACTICAL YOU PRACTICAL YES I'M PRACTICAL
HIS INCIPIENT FRIENDSHIP WITH HER AUNT HAD BEEN NIPPED BY THE FAILURE OF HIS SUIT AND ALL THAT OAK LEARNT OF BATHSHEBA'S MOVEMENTS WAS DONE INDIRECTLY IT APPEARED THAT SHE HAD GONE TO A PLACE CALLED WEATHERBURY
OH AH YES
AND ATTEMPT PERFECTLY CONSISTENT CONDUCT IN A WORLD MADE UP SO LARGELY OF COMPROMISE GABRIEL'S FARM HAD BEEN STOCKED BY A DEALER ON THE STRENGTH OF OAK'S PROMISING LOOK AND CHARACTER
FORMING THE BULK OF THE FLOCK WERE NOWHERE GABRIEL CALLED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE
WHAT DID YOU SAY IN THE
MISTER WILCOX LISTENED ATTENTIVELY I GOT UP THERE OH IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE THAN HALF PAST SEVEN THE AVERY WOMAN WAS LIGHTING A FIRE FOR THEM THEY WERE STILL UPSTAIRS I WAITED IN THE DRAWING ROOM
ANOTHER HOUR PASSED THE SERVANTS WENT TO BED AND CHARLES VISITED HIS FATHER AGAIN TO RECEIVE FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS MISSUS WILCOX HAD STILL NOT RETURNED I'LL SIT UP FOR HER AS LATE AS YOU LIKE
AND BY MAIN FORCE OF WORRYING HAD GIVEN THEM MOMENTUM ENOUGH TO BREAK DOWN A PORTION OF THE ROTTEN RAILING AND SO HURLED THEM OVER THE EDGE GEORGE'S SON HAD DONE HIS WORK SO THOROUGHLY THAT HE WAS CONSIDERED TOO GOOD A WORKMAN TO LIVE
WILL YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE STRONGEST MAN
HE HADN'T TIGER SAID THIS IS A ROUTINE RADIO TELESCOPIC SURVEY REPORT THE STAR IS A RED GIANT BIG AND COLD WITH THREE POSSIBLY FOUR PLANETS INSIDE THE OUTER ENVELOPE OF THE STAR ITSELF AND ONLY ONE OUTSIDE IT
BUT JACK ALSO CAME UP WITH A BLANK CENTRAL RECORDS ON HOSPITAL EARTH SENT BACK A PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF A TINY OUTER PLANET OF THE STAR WITH A THIN OXYGEN NITROGEN ATMOSPHERE VERY LITTLE WATER
MANY STAR SYSTEMS HAD NEVER BEEN EXPLORED BY SHIPS OF THE CONFEDERATION MANY RACES LIKE EARTHMEN AT THE TIME THEIR STAR DRIVE WAS DISCOVERED HAD NO INKLING OF THE EXISTENCE OF A GALACTIC CONFEDERATION OF WORLDS
MY NAME YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE A GUINEA PIG DID YOU THE BLACK DOCTOR SAID I I'M AFRAID I DIDN'T AN UNWITTING TOOL SO TO SPEAK THE BLACK DOCTOR CHUCKLED
WE HAD FULFILLED TWO CRITERIA FOR ADMISSION WITHOUT DIFFICULTY WE HAD RESOLVED OUR PROBLEMS AT HOME SO THAT WE WERE FREE FROM WAR ON OUR OWN PLANET AND WE HAD A TALENT THAT IS MUCH NEEDED
HE WANTED ONLY TO TRAVEL FROM MEDICAL CENTER TO MEDICAL CENTER ON HOSPITAL EARTH OBSERVING AND STUDYING IN ORDER TO DECIDE HOW HE WOULD BEST LIKE TO USE HIS ABILITIES AND HIS POSITION AS A PHYSICIAN FROM HOSPITAL EARTH
TIGER WAS RIGHT THIS WAS ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE WHEN A PLANET WITHOUT A MEDICAL SERVICE CONTRACT CALLED A G P P SHIP FOR HELP THERE WAS ALWAYS HOPE THAT A BRAND NEW CONTRACT MIGHT BE SIGNED IF THE CALL WAS SUCCESSFUL
EVEN MORE STRANGE DAL SAW DELEGATION AFTER DELEGATION OF ALIEN CREATURES MOVING THROUGH THE BUILDING SOME IN THE SPECIAL ATMOSPHERE MAINTAINING DEVICES NECESSARY FOR THEIR SURVIVAL ON EARTH
FUZZY LOOKED UP AT HIM BLINKING HIS SHOE BUTTON EYES HAPPILY YOU ASKED ME ONCE TO LEAVE FUZZY WITH YOU AND I REFUSED I COULDN'T SEE THEN HOW I COULD POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT HIM EVEN THE THOUGHT WAS FRIGHTENING
AND THEN A MESSAGE HAD COME THROUGH TO DAL UNDER THE OFFICIAL HOSPITAL EARTH HEADQUARTERS PRIORITY REQUESTING HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF AT ONCE AT THE GRAND COUNCIL BUILDING AT HOSPITAL PHILADELPHIA FOR AN INTERVIEW OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
I MEAN WE'D BETTER BE VERY CAREFUL HERE JACK SAID DARKLY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I THINK THIS WHOLE BUSINESS HAS A VERY STRANGE SMELL THERE WAS NOTHING STRANGE ABOUT THE BRUCKIAN SHIP WHEN IT FINALLY CAME INTO VIEW
AND STAR SURGEON THE ORDERS WERE SIGNED WITH THE PERSONAL MARK OF HUGO TANNER PHYSICIAN OF THE BLACK SERVICE OF PATHOLOGY NOW THE CEREMONY AND CELEBRATION IN HOSPITAL SEATTLE WERE OVER
YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT ANY INTELLIGENT RACE COULD DEVELOP FROM SCRATCH IN LESS THAN EIGHT CENTURIES TIME DAL PICKED UP THE REPORT AND READ IT AGAIN THIS RED GIANT STAR HE READ WAS STUDIED IN THE USUAL FASHION
NOTHING ABOUT SATELLITES NONE OF THE PLANETS THOUGHT TO BE HABITABLE BY MAN WHAT'S THE OTHER ITEM AN EXPLORATORY REPORT ON THE OUTER PLANET DONE EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS AGO SAYS IT'S AN EARTH TYPE PLANET AND NOT MUCH ELSE
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT AN INTERVIEW WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME AND WHAT ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE DOING HERE DOCTOR ARNQUIST LAUGHED DON'T WORRY HE SAID YOU WON'T HAVE TO STAY FOR THE COUNCIL MEETING
THEY DISCOVERED THAT THEIR HASTE HAD BEEN IN VAIN IT WAS LIKE GRAND ROUNDS IN THE GENERAL WARDS OF HOSPITAL PHILADELPHIA WITH THE FOUR STAR SURGEONS IN THE LEAD AS THEY TRAMPED ABOARD THE PATROL SHIP
IT WAS FOUND TO HAVE SEVEN PLANETS ALL BUT ONE LYING WITHIN THE TENUOUS OUTER GAS ENVELOPE OF THE STAR ITSELF THE SEVENTH PLANET HAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF ITS OWN AND TRAVELS AN ORBIT WELL OUTSIDE THE STAR SURFACE
BUT I'LL BET YOU BOTH THAT WE HAVE QUITE A TIME FINDING OUT WHY TIGER SAID
AND ENOUGH METHANE MIXED IN TO MAKE THE ATMOSPHERE DEADLY TO EARTHMEN THEN THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MEDICAL SERVICE CONTRACT TIGER ASKED CONTRACT JACK SAID IT DOESN'T EVEN SAY THERE ARE ANY PEOPLE THERE
IMMEDIATELY TO THE MEDICAL TRAINING COUNCIL AT HOSPITAL SEATTLE UPON ARRIVAL IN ORDER TO GIVE THEIR FORMAL GENERAL PRACTICE PATROL REPORTS AND TO RECEIVE THEIR APPOINTMENTS RESPECTIVELY AS STAR PHYSICIAN STAR DIAGNOSTICIAN
HE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE BLACK DOCTOR ARNQUIST AT THE INVESTMENT CEREMONIES BUT THERE HAD BEEN NEITHER SIGN NOR WORD FROM HIM DAL TRIED TO REACH HIM AFTER THE CEREMONIES WERE OVER ALL HE COULD LEARN WAS THAT THE BLACK DOCTOR WAS UNAVAILABLE
THE SCARLET CAPE OF THE RED SERVICE OF SURGERY HUNG FROM HIS SLENDER SHOULDERS NOW AND THE LIGHT OF THE STATION ROOM CAUGHT THE POLISHED SILVER EMBLEM ON HIS COLLAR IT WAS A TINY BIT OF METAL
AND REQUEST THE CONFEDERATION RECORDS ON THE PLACE JACK STARED AT HIM YOU MEAN JUST ASK TO SEE CONFEDERATION RECORDS WE CAN'T DO THAT THEY'D SKIN US ALIVE
IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT SILVER STAR AT LAST YOU AND YOUR LITTLE PINK FRIEND HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB A FAR BETTER JOB THAN I THOUGHT YOU WOULD DO I MUST ADMIT DAL PERCHED FUZZY ON HIS SHOULDER BUT
YOU MEAN YOU PERMITTED A PROBATIONARY PHYSICIAN TO PERFORM THIS KIND OF SURGERY THE FOUR STAR SURGEON CRIED INCREDULOUSLY I DID NOT THE BLACK DOCTOR SNAPPED HE HAD TO DRAG ME KICKING AND SCREAMING INTO THE OPERATING ROOM
THE MESSAGE STARED UP AT THEM CRYPTICALLY DAL SHOOK HIS HEAD DOESN'T GIVE US MUCH TO GO ON THAT'S CERTAIN EVEN THE LOCATION COULD BE WRONG IF THE SIGNAL CAME IN ON AN ODD FREQUENCY OR FROM A LONG DISTANCE
AND THE INTELLIGENCE LEVEL OF A GARVIAN DRACHMA HOW SMALL IS THAT JACK SAID IDIOT LEVEL DAL SAID GLUMLY I Q OF ABOUT TWENTY ON THE HUMAN SCALE
BUT HIS WORK HAD SCARCELY REASSURED THE GOUTY WHEN ONE FINE MORNING THE CORPSE OF A FOX THEN THAT OF A HAWK WITH ALL ITS FEATHERS
IT'S A RARE SPECIMEN AT THE SAME TIME I OFFERED HIM THE NEEDLE AND AS HE PIERCED THE INSECT BEFORE FIXING IT ON THE CORK SIR THOMAS UNTIL THEN IMPASSIVE GOT UP AND
HOW INFAMOUS CRIED THE BEAUTIFUL LADIES HOW HORRIBLE SO THAT'S WHAT THE VIRTUE OF THESE MINERAL WATERS CAME FROM OH TWERE BETTER TO DIE OF GRAVEL THAN CONTINUE SUCH A REMEDY
AND I WHO KNEW NOT THEN EVEN BY NAME OF THE TERRIBLE MAGNETIC POWER OF THE WILL BEGAN TO TREMBLE BELIEVING THAT AGATHA WAS DEAD CHRISTIAN WEBER APPROACHED THE NEGRESS
AND DREW FROM THE STRAW A SORT OF GOURD FROM WHICH HE POURED ME A FULL BUMPER IN A LEATHER GOBLET WHEN I HAD DRUNK ALL MY GOOD HUMOR RETURNED AND I BEGAN TO LAUGH AT MY FRIGHT
SHE SAT DOWN WITH A CORPSE LIKE STIFFNESS ALL THE BYSTANDERS WITNESSES OF THIS SHOCKING SPECTACLE GOOD FOLK WITH PRIMITIVE AND CRUDE MANNERS BUT FULL OF PIOUS SENTIMENTS MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS
THEN SMOTHERED DOUBTLESS BY THE SMOKE IT RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AND LEAPED OUT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FLAMES ITS LONG LEGS CURLED UP IT WAS AS LARGE AS MY HEAD AND OF A VIOLET RED
WHEN A BLACK OBJECT WITH LONG HOOKED CLAWS APPEARED SUDDENLY IN THE SHADOW AND PRECIPITATED ITSELF TOWARD THE OPENING A CRY RESOUNDED ABOUT THE PYRE THE SPIDER DRIVEN BACK BY THE LIVE COALS REENTERED ITS CAVE
NOT EVEN ON THE BANKS OF THE MOCARIS NOR IN THE LOWLANDS OF KONANAMA IT IS AS LARGE AS MY HEAD THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE
UNCEASINGLY RENEWED AND DISGORGED ALL AROUND STOOD THE WOODCUTTERS SOMBER MOTIONLESS EXPECTANT THEIR EYES FIXED ON THE OPENING AND I ALTHOUGH TREMBLING FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN FEAR COULD NOT TEAR AWAY MY GAZE
ACCUMULATED THERE IN A SORT OF FUNNEL DURING THE UNIVERSAL FLOOD THAT IS TO SAY FOUR THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE CHRIST AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY ONE MIGHT CONSIDER THEM AS NOTHING BUT STONES AND THAT IT WAS NEEDLESS TO BE DISGUSTED
A VERITABLE BONE YARD CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN SKELETONS OF ANIMALS OF EVERY KIND OF QUADRUPEDS BIRDS AND REPTILES IN SHORT ALL THAT ONE COULD CONCEIVE AS MOST HORRIBLE
AT THE SAME TIME ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU THAT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME ABSURD TO ADMIT THAT A SPIDER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A TEMPERATURE RAISED BY THERMAL WATERS
ON THE SUBJECT OF WHICH HASELNOSS HAD TURNED SUCH FINE PHRASES WAS NO OTHER THAN THAT OF LOUISE MUELLER THE POOR GIRL HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN DRAWN INTO THE GULF BY THE MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE WHICH ALMOST DAILY OVERCAME WEAKER BEINGS
HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED HALF A HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE SHE HAD GONE OUT TO LOOK FOR HERBS IN THE FOREST AND THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY MORE NEWS OF HER AFTERWARDS EXCEPT THAT THREE OR FOUR DAYS LATER
ONE HEARS HIS NURSE CRY OUT ONE IS AFRAID AND THE IMPRESSION STICKS BUT IF YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE SPIDER WITH A STRONG MICROSCOPE YOU WOULD BE ASTONISHED AT THE FINISH OF HIS MEMBERS
TURNED MY HEAD AND SAW THE CAVERN OF SPINBRONN CLOSE AT HAND THE ENCOMPASSING MISTS WERE A MAGNIFICENT GREEN AND THE STREAM WHICH BEFORE FALLING EXTENDS OVER A BED OF BLACK SAND AND PEBBLES WAS SO CLEAR
THE FAGOTS FELL FROM THE TOP OF THE LOADS A FEW STAKES DRIVEN DOWN BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE SPRING PREVENTED THE WATER FROM CARRYING THEM AWAY TOWARD MIDNIGHT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVERN WAS COMPLETELY CLOSED
BUT ARRIVING BEFORE THE CAVERN I STOPPED SEIZED WITH UNACCOUNTABLE TERROR IN CASTING A GLANCE IN THE DEEP SHADOWS OF THE SPRING I HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF TWO MOTIONLESS RED POINTS
SEEMS TO HAVE NO BEARING ON THE SPRINGS OF SPINBRONN BUT WAIT WAIT YOU SHALL SEE BY WHAT A SINGULAR CONCOURSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES MY STORY IS CONNECTED WITH IT I TOLD YOU THAT BIRDS DARTED INTO THE CAVERN
YOU MAY GO I SAW HIM SIT DOWN ON THE MOSS AND DRAW OFF HIS BOOTS AS I MOVED AWAY HE TURNED AND CALLED OUT IN AN HOUR FRANTZ THEY WERE HIS LAST WORDS
DEAD SAID THE DOCTOR HOW THE SPIDER
THE MERE SIGHT OF IT IT MAKES ME SHUDDER IN TRUTH A SUDDEN PALLOR OVERSPREAD HIS FACE BAH SAID MY TUTOR
HOW CALM EVERYTHING IS SAID HE THEN AFTER AN INSTANT OF SILENCE IF YOU WEREN'T HERE FRANTZ I SHOULD CERTAINLY BATHE IN THE BASIN BUT COMMODORE SAID I WHY NOT BATHE
HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE NEGRESS AND WITHOUT A WORD HAVING PASSED BETWEEN THEM THE POOR WOMAN BEGAN TO CRY NO NO I DON'T WANT TO AND I WISH IT
SCARCELY WAS HE SETTLED IN HASELNOSS'S VAST HOUSE WHEN HE PEOPLED THE BACK YARD WITH OUTLANDISH BIRDS BARBARY GEESE WITH SCARLET CHEEKS GUINEA HENS AND A WHITE PEACOCK WHICH PERCHED HABITUALLY ON THE GARDEN WALL
OH YES IT'S CERTAINLY SO SAID HE STRIKING HIS FOREHEAD THE MONSTER COULD COME OUT WITHOUT FEAR HE PRONOUNCED A FEW UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS AND THEN
THE VERY STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED INCIDENT WHICH DISTURBS THE AUDIENCE INSPIRES US LIKE YOURSELVES ONLY WITH A SENTIMENT WHICH IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR US TO EXPRESS
I AM PURSUED IT WOULD ONLY END IN THEIR ARRESTING ME IN THAT ROOM AND THAT WOULD DISTURB HER HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED WHEN A LOUD NOISE BECAME AUDIBLE ON THE STAIRCASE THEY HEARD A TUMULT OF ASCENDING FOOTSTEPS
HE HAD NOT SEEN MADELEINE'S BEGINNINGS JAVERT OWED THE POST WHICH HE OCCUPIED TO THE PROTECTION OF
HE INTERRUPTED HIM IN ACCENTS FULL OF SUAVITY AND AUTHORITY THESE ARE THE WORDS WHICH HE UTTERED HERE THEY ARE LITERALLY AS THEY WERE WRITTEN DOWN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TRIAL BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES TO THIS SCENE
THE FORTUNE OF THE GREAT MANUFACTURER WAS ALREADY MADE AND FATHER MADELEINE HAD BECOME MONSIEUR MADELEINE CERTAIN POLICE OFFICERS HAVE A PECULIAR PHYSIOGNOMY WHICH IS COMPLICATED WITH AN AIR OF BASENESS MINGLED WITH AN AIR OF AUTHORITY
THE EARTH FANTINE WAS GIVEN BACK TO THAT MOTHER
NOR ALL THE EVENING AND THAT I HAVE NOT EVEN LEFT THE DOOR A MAN RESPONDED
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME THAT IS DISTRESSING DO NOT AT LEAST CONDEMN THIS MAN WHAT THESE MEN DO NOT RECOGNIZE ME I WISH JAVERT WERE HERE HE WOULD RECOGNIZE ME
INFALLIBLE IMPERIOUS INTRACTABLE STUBBORN TO ALL COUNSELS OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND TO ALL THE DISSOLVENTS OF REASON AND WHICH IN WHATEVER MANNER DESTINIES ARE ARRANGED SECRETLY WARNS THE MAN DOG OF THE PRESENCE OF THE MAN CAT
THE MAN WHO STOOD THERE APPEARED SO CALM THAT THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND AT FIRST THEY ASKED THEMSELVES WHETHER HE HAD INDEED UTTERED THAT CRY THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT TRANQUIL MAN HAD BEEN THE ONE TO GIVE THAT TERRIBLE OUTCRY
COME IN SAID HE IT WAS SISTER SIMPLICE SHE WAS PALE HER EYES WERE RED THE CANDLE WHICH SHE CARRIED TREMBLED IN HER HAND THE PECULIAR FEATURE OF THE VIOLENCES OF DESTINY IS
WHICH IS KILLED BY THE MOTHER BECAUSE OTHERWISE AS HE GREW UP HE WOULD DEVOUR THE OTHER LITTLE ONES GIVE TO THIS DOG SON OF A WOLF A HUMAN FACE AND THE RESULT WILL BE JAVERT JAVERT HAD BEEN BORN IN PRISON OF A FORTUNE TELLER
A FEROCIOUS HONESTY A MARBLE INFORMER BRUTUS IN VIDOCQ JAVERT'S WHOLE PERSON WAS EXPRESSIVE OF THE MAN WHO SPIES AND WHO WITHDRAWS HIMSELF FROM OBSERVATION
NOR ANY ADVICE TO GIVE TO SOCIETY BUT YOU SEE THE INFAMY FROM WHICH I HAVE TRIED TO ESCAPE IS AN INJURIOUS THING THE GALLEYS MAKE THE CONVICT WHAT HE IS REFLECT UPON THAT IF YOU PLEASE
WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO DECLARE THAT JAVERT WAS A SYMBOL HIS BROW WAS NOT VISIBLE IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH HIS HAT HIS EYES WERE NOT VISIBLE SINCE THEY WERE LOST UNDER HIS EYEBROWS HIS CHIN WAS NOT VISIBLE
CHENILDIEU YOU WHO CONFERRED ON YOURSELF THE NAME OF JENIE DIEU YOUR WHOLE RIGHT SHOULDER BEARS A DEEP BURN BECAUSE YOU ONE DAY LAID YOUR SHOULDER AGAINST THE CHAFING DISH FULL OF COALS IN ORDER TO EFFACE THE THREE LETTERS T F P
NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT HOW HE HAD MANAGED TO GET INTO THE COURTYARD WITHOUT OPENING THE BIG GATES HE HAD AND ALWAYS CARRIED ABOUT HIM A PASS KEY WHICH OPENED A LITTLE SIDE DOOR BUT HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEARCHED AND HIS LATCH KEY MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM
HUMAN FACE WHICH WE HAVE JUST APPLIED TO JAVERT THE HUMAN FACE OF JAVERT CONSISTED OF A FLAT NOSE WITH TWO DEEP NOSTRILS TOWARDS WHICH ENORMOUS WHISKERS ASCENDED ON HIS CHEEKS
I SHALL WITHDRAW SINCE YOU DO NOT ARREST ME I HAVE MANY THINGS TO DO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY KNOWS WHO I AM HE KNOWS WHITHER I AM GOING HE CAN HAVE ME ARRESTED WHEN HE LIKES HE DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR
THEN PREFECT OF POLICE AT PARIS
HAVING MADE THIS RESERVATION LET US PASS ON NOW IF THE READER WILL ADMIT FOR A MOMENT WITH US THAT IN EVERY MAN THERE IS ONE OF THE ANIMAL SPECIES OF CREATION
AN EYE FULL OF SUSPICION AND CONJECTURE
IS OF COURSE FROM THE RESTRICTED POINT OF VIEW OF THE TERRESTRIAL LIFE WHICH IS APPARENT AND WITHOUT PREJUDGING THE PROFOUND QUESTION OF THE ANTERIOR OR ULTERIOR PERSONALITY OF THE BEINGS WHICH ARE NOT MAN THE VISIBLE I
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF AN INDESCRIBABLE FOUNDATION OF RIGIDITY REGULARITY AND PROBITY COMPLICATED WITH AN INEXPRESSIBLE HATRED FOR THE RACE OF BOHEMIANS WHENCE HE WAS SPRUNG HE ENTERED THE POLICE
REMAINED HIS OPPONENT AS THOUGH A SORT OF INCORRUPTIBLE AND IMPERTURBABLE INSTINCT KEPT HIM ON THE ALERT AND UNEASY IT SEEMS IN FACT
BUT HIS GUMS AND AROUND HIS NOSE THERE FORMED A FLATTENED AND SAVAGE FOLD AS ON THE MUZZLE OF A WILD BEAST JAVERT SERIOUS WAS A WATCHDOG
WHICH IN THE COURSE OF SIX OR SEVEN YEARS GRADUALLY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE DISTRICT ONE SINGLE MAN IN THE TOWN IN THE ARRONDISSEMENT ABSOLUTELY ESCAPED THIS CONTAGION AND WHATEVER FATHER MADELEINE DID
WITH FOLDED ARMS AND A SLOW SHAKE OF THE HEAD AND HIS UPPER LIP RAISED IN COMPANY WITH HIS LOWER TO HIS NOSE A SORT OF SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE WHICH MIGHT BE TRANSLATED BY WHAT IS THAT MAN AFTER ALL
THEY WERE RIGHT IN TELLING YOU THAT JEAN VALJEAN WAS A VERY VICIOUS WRETCH PERHAPS IT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER HIS FAULT LISTEN HONORABLE JUDGES A MAN WHO HAS BEEN SO GREATLY HUMBLED AS I HAVE HAS NEITHER ANY REMONSTRANCES TO MAKE TO PROVIDENCE
HE PUT AN END TO DIFFERENCES HE PREVENTED LAWSUITS HE RECONCILED ENEMIES EVERY ONE TOOK HIM FOR THE JUDGE AND WITH GOOD REASON IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE HAD FOR A SOUL THE BOOK OF THE NATURAL LAW IT WAS LIKE AN EPIDEMIC OF VENERATION
SO DECISIVE A THING THAT HE DID NOT EVEN OBSERVE THE SINGULARITY OF THAT CANDLE WHICH HAD BUT JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED AND WHICH WAS STILL SMOKING ON THE TABLE AN HOUR LATER A MAN MARCHING AMID TREES AND MISTS
SICKENING CONTRASTS AND DIABOLIC IRONIES OF LIFE SILENCE FELL SINGING LUSTILY AS IF TO EXORCISE THE DEMON OF GLOOM SKIRMISHES AND RETREATS OF CONSCIENCE
CONSUMED BY A DEMON OF ACTIVITY CONTINUOUS AND STUBBORN DISREGARD CONTRARY TO THE CLEAREST CONVICTION OF HIS JUDGMENT COUCHED IN TERMS OF FEIGNED DEVOTION CREDULOUS AND EMOTIONALLY EXTRAVAGANT
AN INEXHAUSTIBLE COPIOUSNESS AND READINESS OF SPEECH AN INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR TRIFLES AN INSATIABLE VORACITY AN INSCRUTABLE MYSTERY
DISPLAYED ENORMOUS POWER AND SPLENDOR DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES BY THEIR ECCENTRICITIES DISTRACTED BY CONTENDING DESIRES DIVERSITY OF MIND AND TEMPERAMENT
S SACRIFICED TO A FUTILE SORT OF TREADMILL SADNESS PREVAILED AMONG HER MOODS SCORCHED WITH THE LIGHTNING OF MOMENTARY INDIGNATION SCORNING SUCH PALTRY DEVICES
AN ENDLESS FIELD FOR DISCUSSION AN ENERVATING AND EMASCULATING FORM OF INDULGENCE AN ENNOBLING AND INVIGORATING INFLUENCE AN ENTIRELY NEGLIGIBLE QUANTITY
IT'S A MATTER OF IMMEDIATE URGENCY IT'S ABSOLUTE FOLLY IT'S ABSURD IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IT'S ALL NONSENSE IT'S AS LOGICAL AS IT CAN BE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
CLEVER AND CAPTIVATING ELOQUENCE COARSE AND GLITTERING OSTENTATION COHERENT AND CONTINUOUS TREND OF THOUGHT COMMENDED BY PERFECT SUAVITY
SHE FELL INTO A DREAMY SILENCE SHE FELL INTO ABSTRACTED REVERIE SHE FELT HERSELF CARRIED OFF HER FEET BY THE RUSH OF INCOHERENT IMPRESSIONS SHE FLUSHED AN AGITATED PINK
IT IS NOT SO UNREASONABLE AS YOU THINK IT IS OFTEN VERY MISLEADING IT IS ONE OF THE GRAVE PROBLEMS OF THE DAY IT IS ONLY A FANCY OF MINE
SENSUOUS ENJOYMENT OF THE OUTWARD SHOW OF LIFE SERENITY BEAMED FROM HIS LOOK SERENITY OF PARALYSIS AND DEATH SERIOUSNESS LURKED IN THE DEPTHS OF HER EYES
AS BELATED AS THEY ARE FALLACIOUS AS BY A SECRET OF FREEMASONRY AS ODIOUS AS IT IS ABSURD AS RIDICULOUS AS IT WAS UNNECESSARY
SUNNY SILENCE BROODS OVER THE REALM OF LITTLE COTTAGES SUPREME ARBITER OF CONDUCT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO FLEETING IMPRESSIONS
IT'S VERY WONDERFUL IT MAKES IT ALL QUITE INTERESTING IT MAY SOUND STRANGE TO YOU
SUBLIME INDIFFERENCE TO CONTEMPORARY USAGE AND TASTE SUBMISSION TO AN IMPLIED REBUKE SUBTLE INDICATIONS OF GREAT MENTAL AGITATION SUBTLE SUGGESTIONS OF REMOTENESS
AN INDOMITABLE AND UNSELFISH SOUL AN INERADICABLE LOVE OF FUN AND MYSTIFICATION AN INEVITABLE FACTOR OF HUMAN CONDUCT
SHE LINGERED A FEW LEISURELY SECONDS SHE NODDED MUTELY SHE NOURISHED A DREAM OF AMBITION SHE PERMITTED HERSELF A DELICATE LITTLE SMILE SHE POURED OUT ON HIM THE FULL OPULENCE OF A PROUD RECOGNITION
IT WILL CREATE A CONSIDERABLE SENSATION IT WILL DIVERT YOUR THOUGHTS FROM A MOURNFUL SUBJECT IT WILL GIVE ME PLEASURE TO DO IT IT WILL NOT ALTER MY DETERMINATION IT WOULD BE ILL ADVISED
IT IS QUITE CONCEIVABLE IT IS QUITE TOO ABSURD IT IS RATHER STARTLING IT IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE IT IS REALLY MOST CALLOUS OF YOU TO LAUGH
AN ESSENTIALLY GROTESQUE AND COMMONPLACE THING AN ETERNAL AND IMPERISHABLE EXAMPLE
CAUGHT UNAWARES BY A BASE IMPULSE CEASELESS TRAMP OF HUMANITY CENSURED FOR HIS NEGLIGENCE CHAMPIONING THE CAUSE OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION CHASTENED AND REFINED BY EXPERIENCE
AN AIR OF ROUND EYED PROFUNDITY AN ALARMED SENSE OF STRANGE RESPONSIBILITIES AN ALMOST EXCESSIVE EXACTNESS
SUDDENLY SMITTEN WITH UNREALITY SUDDENLY SNUFFED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF AMBITIOUS SCHEMES SUFFERED TO LANGUISH IN OBSCURITY SUGARED REMONSTRANCES AND CAJOLERIES
AN ARTFUL AND MALIGNANT ENEMY AN ASSUMPTION ENTIRELY GRATUITOUS AN ASSUMPTION WHICH PROVED ERRONEOUS AN ATMOSPHERE OF SUNNY GAIETY AN ATTITUDE OF PASSIVE IMPARTIALITY
DAZZLED BY THEIR NOVELTY AND BRILLIANCE DEBASED BY COMMON USE DEEP ESSENTIALS OF MORAL GRANDEUR DEEPLY ENGROSSED IN CONGENIAL WORK DEEPLY MOVED AS WELL AS KEENLY STUNG
IT IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING I CAN ASSURE YOU IT IS FOR YOU TO DECIDE IT IS HISTORICALLY TRUE IT IS I WHO SHOULD ASK FORGIVENESS IT IS INCREDIBLE
IT IS INDEED GENEROUS OF YOU TO SUGGEST IT IT IS INEXPLICABLE IT IS INTERESTING AS A THEORY IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE IT IS MERELY A MOOD IT IS MOST UNFORTUNATE
DISDAINING THE GUIDANCE OF REASON DISENCHANTING EFFECT OF TIME AND EXPERIENCE DISFIGURED BY GLARING FAULTS DISGUISED IN SENTIMENTAL FRIPPERY DISPEL ALL ANXIOUS CONCERN
I WILL TAKE A WALK ROUND THE TOWN TO INFORM MYSELF WHAT PEOPLE SAY AND PARTICULARLY HOW THEY ARE PLEASED WITH MY OFFICERS OF JUSTICE IF THERE BE ANY AGAINST WHOM THEY HAVE CAUSE OF JUST COMPLAINT WE WILL TURN THEM OUT AND PUT OTHERS IN THEIR STEAD WHO SHALL OFFICIATE BETTER
WHEN THE TRUNK WAS OPENED THEY FOUND IN IT A LARGE BASKET MADE OF PALM LEAVES
NOT ONLY IN BAGDAD BUT THROUGH ALL THE DOMINIONS OF THE CALIPH NOTHING COULD PREVENT THE EXECUTION OF THIS PRINCE'S SEVERE AND IRREVOCABLE SENTENCE AND THE LIVES OF THE MOST DESERVING PEOPLE IN THE CITY
AND WHEN THE RAJA'S MEN SAW THAT KARA AND GUJA HAD NOTHING BUT A DRUM THEY SAID YES IT IS YOUR TURN
MAY BE WELDED INTO A SOLID AND COMPACT BODY BY AN ATTACK FROM A FOREIGN POWER THE IMPERATIVE CALL TO COMMON DEFENSE THE HABIT OF SHARING COMMON BURDENS
AND PREPARED TO CONTEST ON LAND AND WATER THE ADVANCE OF BRITISH DOMINION IN AMERICA RELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS AND THE FRENCH INDIAN AFFAIRS
OWED THEIR ORIGINS AND THEIR ENDINGS MAINLY TO THE INTRIGUES AND RIVALRIES OF EUROPEAN POWERS ALTHOUGH THEY ALL INVOLVED THE AMERICAN COLONIES IN STRUGGLES WITH THE FRENCH AND THEIR SAVAGE ALLIES THE CLASH IN THE OHIO VALLEY
AND THROW MY SUBJECTS INTO THE TIGRIS THAT THEY MAY CRY FOR VENGEANCE AGAINST ME AT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT
BUT THE OLD MAN MAINTAINED THE CONTRARY GO SAID THE CALIPH TO THE GRAND VIZIER AND CAUSE THEM BOTH TO BE IMPALED BUT SIR SAID THE VIZIER IF ONLY ONE OF THEM BE GUILTY
WHEN HE CAME BEFORE THE PRINCE HE KISSED THE GROUND SEVEN TIMES AND SPAKE AFTER THIS MANNER COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I HAVE BROUGHT HERE BEFORE YOUR MAJESTY THIS OLD AND THIS YOUNG MAN EACH OF WHOM DECLARES HIMSELF TO BE THE SOLE MURDERER OF THE LADY
SAYING TO HIMSELF AS HE WENT THESE GENTLEMEN SEEM TOO HONEST AND REASONABLE NOT TO REWARD MY PAINS
THE SECOND OF THESE WARS HAD HARDLY CLOSED HOWEVER BEFORE THE ENGLISH COLONISTS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED ABOUT THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING FRENCH DOMINION IN THE WEST MARQUETTE AND JOLIET
PERSONAL TREACHERY OR A FLASH OF BAD TEMPER OFTEN SET IN MOTION DESTRUCTIVE FORCES OF THE MOST TERRIBLE CHARACTER ON ONE SIDE OF THE LEDGER MAY BE SET INNUMERABLE GENEROUS RECORDS
CARRIED THE BODIES TO THE RAJA AND HE GAVE THEM A GRANT OF LAND AND THEIR GRATEFUL NEIGHBOURS MADE A LARGE RICE FIELD OF THE DEPRESSION WHICH THE KITES HAD MADE IN THE EARTH AND THIS WAS GIVEN TO KARA AND GUJA AS SERVICE LAND TO THEIR GREAT DELIGHT
CALLED HIS TRIBESMEN TO A WAR OF EXTERMINATION WHICH BROUGHT THE STRENGTH OF ALL NEW ENGLAND TO THE FIELD AND ENDED IN HIS OWN DESTRUCTION
BY THE DEATH OF HER MURDERER I SWEAR BY HEAVEN THAT I WILL CAUSE THEE AND FORTY MORE OF THY KINDRED TO BE IMPALED COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL REPLIED THE GRAND VIZIER I BEG YOUR MAJESTY TO GRANT ME TIME TO MAKE ENQUIRY
CONQUESTS EQUALING IN RAPIDITY AND FAR SURPASSING IN MAGNITUDE THOSE OF CORTES AND PIZARRO HAD BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE EAST WELL COULD THE MERCHANTS OF LONDON DECLARE THAT UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF WILLIAM PITT THE IMPERIAL GENIUS OF THIS WORLD WIDE CONFLICT
BELIEVED HIM ESPECIALLY SINCE THE OLD MAN MADE NO ANSWER WHEREUPON TURNING TO THE YOUNG MAN WRETCH SAID HE WHAT MADE THEE COMMIT THAT DETESTABLE CRIME AND WHAT IS IT THAT MOVES THEE TO OFFER THYSELF VOLUNTARILY TO DIE
AS WELL AS THE SAINT LAWRENCE
IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE GENERAL STATEMENTS ABOUT THE RELATIONS OF THE COLONISTS TO THE INDIANS THE PROBLEM WAS PRESENTED IN DIFFERENT SHAPE IN DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF AMERICA IT WAS NOT HANDLED ACCORDING TO ANY COHERENT OR UNIFORM PLAN BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT
AS THE DIFFICULTIES AROSE MAINLY ON THE FRONTIERS WHERE THE RESTLESS AND PUSHING PIONEERS WERE MAKING THEIR WAY WITH GUN AND AX NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WAS THE RESULT OF CHANCE RATHER THAN OF CALCULATION
ACT AS AN AMALGAM DRAWING TOGETHER ALL ELEMENTS EXCEPT PERHAPS THE MOST DISCORDANT THE PRESENCE OF THE ENEMY ALLAYS THE MOST VIRULENT OF QUARRELS TEMPORARILY AT LEAST POLITICS RUNS AN OLD SAYING
A PUBLIC CRIER WAS SENT ABOUT THE CITY BY THE CALIPH'S ORDER TO CRY THUS THOSE WHO HAVE A DESIRE TO SEE THE GRAND VIZIER JAAFFIER IMPALED WITH FORTY OF HIS KINDRED LET THEM COME TO THE SQUARE BEFORE THE PALACE
IT IS DESPAIR THAT BROUGHT YOU HITHER AND YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE YOUR DESTINY
WHITER THAN SNOW ALL CUT IN PIECES
COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY PERSON THAT COULD GIVE ME THE LEAST ACCOUNT OF HIM
AND COMFORTER OF THE POOR YOU ARE NOT GUILTY OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH YOU STAND HERE WITHDRAW AND LET ME EXPIATE THE DEATH OF THE LADY THAT WAS THROWN INTO THE TIGRIS IT IS I WHO MURDERED HER AND I DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED FOR MY OFFENCE
WHO UNDOUBTEDLY COMMITTED THE CRIME WITHOUT WITNESS AND PERHAPS MAY BE ALREADY GONE FROM HENCE ANY OTHER VIZIER THAN I WOULD TAKE SOME WRETCHED PERSON OUT OF PRISON AND CAUSE HIM TO BE PUT TO DEATH TO SATISFY THE CALIPH BUT I WILL NOT BURDEN MY CONSCIENCE WITH SUCH A BARBAROUS ACTION
THE ENGLISH COLONIES ENGROSSED WITH THEIR OWN PROBLEMS GAVE LITTLE OR NO THOUGHT TO THEIR DISTANT NEIGHBORS
AND FRANCE AUSTRIA SPAIN AND MINOR POWERS ON THE OTHER ON AMERICAN SOIL THE DEFEAT OF BRADDOCK IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE AND WOLFE'S EXPLOIT IN CAPTURING QUEBEC FOUR YEARS LATER WERE THE DRAMATIC FEATURES
SPAIN CEDED TO KING GEORGE THE COLONY OF FLORIDA
SO WELL UNDERSTOOD IN DIPLOMATIC CIRCLES APPLIED NEARLY AS WELL TO THE ORIGINAL THIRTEEN AMERICAN COLONIES AS TO THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE THE NECESSITY FOR COMMON DEFENSE IF NOT EQUALLY GREAT WAS CERTAINLY ALWAYS PRESSING
IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE WHOLE FRONTIER WAS ABLAZE NATHANIEL BACON VAINLY ATTEMPTED TO STIR THE COLONIAL GOVERNOR TO PUT UP AN ADEQUATE DEFENSE AND FAILING IN THAT PLEA HIMSELF HEADED A REVOLT AND A SUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION AGAINST THE INDIANS
IN VARIOUS WAYS IT WAS THE PREVALENT OPINION HOWEVER
IN THE PRIVACY OF HIS OWN ABODE THE SYMPATHY OF ONE LIKE HIMSELF AGED FORLORN AND CHILDLESS THE INDIANS WHO BELIEVE IN THE HEREDITARY TRANSMISSION OF VIRTUES AND DEFECTS IN CHARACTER
NOW KNEW THAT ALL HIS PROJECTS MUST BE BROUGHT TO THEIR FINAL ISSUE
SUFFERED HIM TO DEPART IN SILENCE THEN WITH AN ELEVATION OF BREEDING THAT MANY IN A MORE CULTIVATED STATE OF SOCIETY MIGHT PROFITABLY EMULATE ONE OF THE CHIEFS DREW THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG MEN
SEVERAL PIPES THAT HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED WERE LIGHTED AGAIN
THE TOMAHAWKS OF YOUR YOUNG MEN HAVE BEEN VERY RED IT IS SO BUT THEY ARE NOW BRIGHT AND DULL FOR THE YENGEESE ARE DEAD AND THE DELAWARES ARE OUR NEIGHBORS
THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE CHASE WERE TO BE SEEN IN ABUNDANCE AMONG THE LODGES BUT NONE DEPARTED HERE AND THERE A WARRIOR WAS EXAMINING HIS ARMS WITH AN ATTENTION THAT IS RARELY BESTOWED ON THE IMPLEMENTS
DOES MY PRISONER GIVE TROUBLE TO MY BROTHERS SHE IS WELCOME THE PATH BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE DELAWARES IS SHORT AND IT IS OPEN LET HER BE SENT TO MY SQUAWS IF SHE GIVES TROUBLE TO MY BROTHER
WHEN NO OTHER ENEMY THAN THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST IS EXPECTED TO BE ENCOUNTERED AND OCCASIONALLY THE EYES OF A WHOLE GROUP WERE TURNED SIMULTANEOUSLY
HAD NUMBERED AN AMOUNT OF YEARS TO WHICH THE HUMAN RACE IS SELDOM PERMITTED TO ATTAIN HIS FRAME WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN TALL AND ERECT LIKE THE CEDAR WAS NOW BENDING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF MORE THAN A CENTURY
HIS DARK WRINKLED COUNTENANCE WAS IN SINGULAR AND WILD CONTRAST WITH THE LONG WHITE LOCKS WHICH FLOATED ON HIS SHOULDERS
AND THEY WERE NOW MADE TO FEEL THAT THEIR FUTURE ACTIONS WERE TO BE REGARDED WITH JEALOUSY AND DISTRUST THERE WAS NO DEEP INSIGHT INTO CAUSES AND EFFECTS NECESSARY TO FORESEE
IN SHORT EVERY OCCUPATION WAS ABANDONED FOR THE TIME AND ALL OTHER PURSUITS SEEMED DISCARDED IN ORDER THAT THE TRIBE MIGHT FREELY INDULGE AFTER THEIR OWN PECULIAR MANNER IN AN OPEN EXPRESSION OF FEELING
COMPOSED OF CRACKED CORN AND BEANS IT IS MUCH USED ALSO BY THE WHITES BY CORN IS MEANT MAISE
AFTER THIS TERMINATION OF THE SCENE DUNCAN WANDERED AMONG THE LODGES UNQUESTIONED AND UNNOTICED ENDEAVORING TO FIND SOME TRACE OF HER IN WHOSE BEHALF HE INCURRED THE RISK HE RAN
WHO BELONGS RATHER TO ANOTHER WORLD THAN TO THIS WAS RECEIVED BY HIS PEOPLE AFTER A SUITABLE AND DECENT PAUSE
THOUGH THE RETURN OF DUNCAN WAS LIKELY TO REMIND THEM OF HIS CHARACTER AND THE SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS VISIT IT PRODUCED NO VISIBLE SENSATION SO FAR THE TERRIBLE SCENE THAT HAD JUST OCCURRED
MAGUA HAD NOT ONLY MAINTAINED HIS SEAT BUT THE VERY ATTITUDE HE HAD ORIGINALLY TAKEN AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE LODGE
NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY INDIVIDUAL PRESENT WAS PERFECTLY AWARE
WILL HE THINK SO WHEN HE HEARS THAT HIS GREATEST ENEMY IS FED IN THE CAMP OF HIS CHILDREN
THE OLD MEN DISPOSED THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER THAT WHICH IT BECAME THE HONOR AND SAFETY OF THEIR TRIBE TO PERFORM UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF SO MUCH DELICACY AND EMBARRASSMENT
IN TOUCHING CONTRAST TO THE COLOR OF HIS SNOW WHITE LOCKS HIS TOMAHAWK WAS NEARLY HID IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE OF HIS KNIFE SHONE LIKE A HORN OF SOLID GOLD SO SOON AS THE FIRST HUM OF EMOTION AND PLEASURE
EQUAL TO THAT MAINTAINED BY THE CHIEF WHO WAS IN TRUTH A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE AFFLICTED WOMAN THE MINUTES LINGERED AND THE DELAY HAD SEEMED AN HOUR TO THE ADVENTURER IN EMPIRICISM WHEN THE HURON LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE
SHE IS WELCOME RETURNED THE CHIEF OF THE LATTER NATION STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY THE BAFFLED MAGUA CONTINUED SILENT SEVERAL MINUTES APPARENTLY INDIFFERENT HOWEVER TO THE REPULSE HE HAD RECEIVED
THE ELASTIC LIGHT STEP OF AN INDIAN WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE HE WAS COMPELLED TO TOIL HIS TARDY WAY OVER THE GROUND
HE WOULD GREATLY HAVE PREFERRED SILENCE AND MEDITATION TO SPEECH WHEN A DISCOVERY OF HIS REAL CONDITION MIGHT PROVE SO INSTANTLY FATAL UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS PRUDENT RESOLUTION HIS ENTERTAINERS APPEARED OTHERWISE DISPOSED
WITH MANIFEST DISAPPROBATION IF NOT WITH ALARM
THAT SUCH A SITUATION OF THINGS WAS LIKELY TO PROVE HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL TO THEIR FUTURE MOVEMENTS THEIR DISTANT VILLAGES THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS
WITH THE DIGNITY OF A MONARCH AND THE AIR OF A FATHER
STANDING A SINGLE MINUTE TO ENJOY HIS BITTER TRIUMPH HE TURNED AWAY AS IF SICKENING AT THE GAZE OF MEN AND VEILING HIS FACE IN HIS BLANKET HE WALKED FROM THE LODGE WITH THE NOISELESS STEP OF AN INDIAN SEEKING
TOGETHER WITH A MATERIAL PART OF THEIR PHYSICAL FORCE WERE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE FRENCH TERRITORY ACCORDINGLY THIS ALARMING ANNUNCIATION WAS RECEIVED AS MAGUA INTENDED
HE HAD NOT LONG OCCUPIED THE SEAT WISELY TAKEN A LITTLE IN THE SHADE WHEN ANOTHER OF THE ELDER WARRIORS WHO SPOKE THE FRENCH LANGUAGE ADDRESSED HIM MY CANADA FATHER DOES NOT FORGET HIS CHILDREN SAID THE CHIEF
BY THROWING HIS ARM UPWARD TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEN LETTING IT FALL IMPRESSIVELY ON HIS BREAST
AN APPELLATION THAT THE FRENCH HAD TRANSLATED INTO LE COEUR DUR FORGOT THAT OBDURACY OF PURPOSE
THE EYES OF THE OLD MAN WERE CLOSED AS THOUGH THE ORGANS WERE WEARIED WITH HAVING SO LONG WITNESSED THE SELFISH WORKINGS OF THE HUMAN PASSIONS
HE RETRACED HIS STEPS TO THE COUNCIL LODGE RESOLVED TO SEEK AND QUESTION DAVID IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO HIS DOUBTS ON REACHING THE BUILDING WHICH HAD PROVED ALIKE THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT AND THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
RELIGION IN AMERICA TAKES NO DIRECT PART IN THE GOVERNMENT OF SOCIETY BUT IT MUST NEVERTHELESS BE REGARDED AS THE FOREMOST OF THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY FOR IF IT DOES NOT IMPART A TASTE FOR FREEDOM
DESPOTISM MAY GOVERN WITHOUT FAITH BUT LIBERTY CANNOT RELIGION IS MUCH MORE NECESSARY IN THE REPUBLIC WHICH THEY SET FORTH IN GLOWING COLORS THAN IN THE MONARCHY WHICH THEY ATTACK AND IT IS MORE NEEDED IN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICS
WHILST THE EUROPEAN ENDEAVORS TO FORGET HIS DOMESTIC TROUBLES BY AGITATING SOCIETY THE AMERICAN DERIVES FROM HIS OWN HOME THAT LOVE OF ORDER WHICH HE AFTERWARDS CARRIES WITH HIM INTO PUBLIC AFFAIRS
IF CATHOLICISM PREDISPOSES THE FAITHFUL TO OBEDIENCE IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT PREPARE THEM FOR INEQUALITY BUT THE CONTRARY MAY BE SAID OF PROTESTANTISM WHICH GENERALLY TENDS TO MAKE MEN INDEPENDENT MORE THAN TO RENDER THEM EQUAL
AND MAY GIVE A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE AFTER ALL WHAT CAN THE CATHOLIC LORDS HAVE BEEN ABOUT THAT THEY MANAGED TO LET THEM SLIP THROUGH THEIR HANDS IN THAT WAY THEY MUST HAVE SEEN FOR SOME TIME THAT THEY WERE MAKING FOR THE ONE PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD BE SAFE UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE MAKING DOWN FOR NAVARRE
OR WHERE CONJUGAL HAPPINESS IS MORE HIGHLY OR WORTHILY APPRECIATED IN EUROPE ALMOST ALL THE DISTURBANCES OF SOCIETY ARISE FROM THE IRREGULARITIES OF DOMESTIC LIFE
THESE HABITS OF RESTRAINT RECUR IN POLITICAL SOCIETY AND ARE SINGULARLY FAVORABLE BOTH TO THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE PEOPLE AND TO THE DURABILITY OF THE INSTITUTIONS IT HAS ESTABLISHED
THEY ALL DIFFER IN RESPECT TO THE WORSHIP WHICH IS DUE FROM MAN TO HIS CREATOR BUT THEY ALL AGREE IN RESPECT TO THE DUTIES WHICH ARE DUE FROM MAN TO MAN EACH SECT ADORES THE DEITY IN ITS OWN PECULIAR MANNER
WHO ACTED AS SPOKESMAN HAD ON ENTERING ASKED THE LANDLORD IF THEY COULD SLEEP THERE
FROM HABIT MORE THAN FROM CONVICTION IN THE UNITED STATES THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY IS RELIGIOUS AND CONSEQUENTLY HYPOCRISY MUST BE COMMON BUT THERE IS NO COUNTRY IN THE WHOLE WORLD IN WHICH THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
AND FIND THAT THEY ARE TOO FAST FOR YOU PUT THEM ASHORE WHEREVER THEY MAY DIRECT IF YOU ARE TOO HOTLY CHASED TO ESCAPE AFTER LANDING THEM YOU HAD BEST ALSO DISEMBARK AND MAKE YOUR WAY BACK BY LAND AS BEST YOU CAN LEAVING THEM TO DO WHAT THEY WILL WITH THE BOAT AS LIKE AS NOT THEY WOULD CUT YOUR THROATS DID THEY TAKE YOU
THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT THERE IS NOT A DAY PASSES NOW THAT THE WIND IS FAIR THAT THREE OR FOUR BOATS DO NOT GO OFF TO BORDEAUX WITH PRODUCE FROM THE FARMS AND VINEYARDS OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T GET UP WITHOUT PAYING
FOR WHO CAN SEARCH THE HUMAN HEART BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT THEY HOLD IT TO BE INDISPENSABLE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS THIS OPINION IS NOT PECULIAR TO A CLASS OF CITIZENS OR TO A PARTY BUT IT BELONGS TO THE WHOLE NATION AND TO EVERY RANK OF SOCIETY
AND WE THANK YOU FOR HAVING PUT US IN THE WAY OF SAVING OUR LEGS TOMORROW WHAT TIME DO YOU THINK YOUR COUSIN WILL BE IN HE WILL HAVE HIS CARTS AT THE GATES BY THE TIME THEY OPEN THEM HE IS NOT ONE TO WASTE TIME BESIDES EVERY MINUTE IS OF IMPORTANCE
BE NOT CONSUMMATED IN OUR TIME O LORD WHO HOLDEST ALIKE THE HEARTS OF NATIONS AND OF MEN IN THY POWERFUL HAND RAISE UP ALLIES TO THE SACRED CAUSE OF RIGHT AROUSE THE FRENCH NATION FROM THE APATHY IN WHICH ITS RULERS RETAIN IT
IF THEN THE CATHOLIC CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES ARE NOT FORCIBLY LED BY THE NATURE OF THEIR TENETS TO ADOPT DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES AT LEAST THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO THEM
THAT WILL BE AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER WAY AND SAVE MUCH TROUBLE IT IS A LONG CHASE TO CATCH A PACK OF WOLVES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT ONE CAN MAKE SHORT WORK OF THEM ALL WHEN YOU GET THEM PENNED UP IN AN INCLOSURE
WHILST I WAS IN AMERICA A WITNESS WHO HAPPENED TO BE CALLED AT THE ASSIZES OF THE COUNTY OF CHESTER
THEY WERE ROWED ASHORE IN THE LITTLE BOAT THE CRAFT CARRIED
CATHOLICISM IS LIKE AN ABSOLUTE MONARCHY IF THE SOVEREIGN BE REMOVED ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF SOCIETY ARE MORE EQUAL THAN THEY ARE IN REPUBLICS
INFLUENCE OF MANNERS UPON THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES I HAVE PREVIOUSLY REMARKED THAT THE MANNERS OF THE PEOPLE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE GENERAL
WITH WHICH THEY SEEK FOR FORTUNE IF THE MIND OF THE AMERICANS WERE FREE FROM ALL TRAMMELS THEY WOULD VERY SHORTLY BECOME THE MOST DARING INNOVATORS AND THE MOST IMPLACABLE DISPUTANTS IN THE WORLD
TOWARDS WHICH MODERN SOCIETY IS DAILY IMPELLED BY THE IDEAS AND MANNERS OF THE TIME AND WHO SINCERELY DESIRE TO PREPARE MEN TO BE FREE WHEN THESE MEN ATTACK RELIGIOUS OPINIONS THEY OBEY THE DICTATES OF THEIR PASSIONS
IT IS CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY BARRIERS WHICH IT CANNOT SURMOUNT BEFORE IT CAN PERPETRATE INNOVATION CERTAIN PRIMAL AND IMMUTABLE PRINCIPLES ARE LAID DOWN AND THE BOLDEST CONCEPTIONS OF HUMAN DEVICE ARE SUBJECTED TO CERTAIN FORMS
THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE HAS NO TROOPS
THEY KEEP ALOOF FROM PARTIES AND FROM PUBLIC AFFAIRS IN THE UNITED STATES RELIGION EXERCISES BUT LITTLE INFLUENCE UPON THE LAWS AND UPON THE DETAILS OF PUBLIC OPINION BUT IT DIRECTS THE MANNERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND BY REGULATING DOMESTIC LIFE
WHAT I HAVE PREVIOUSLY EXPLAINED THREE CIRCUMSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO CONTRIBUTE MOST POWERFULLY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES THE FIRST IS THAT FEDERAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THE AMERICANS HAVE ADOPTED
CAUSES TO WHICH THE MAINTENANCE OF A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES IS ATTRIBUTABLE I HERE USED THE WORD MANNERS WITH THE MEANING WHICH THE ANCIENTS ATTACHED TO THE WORD MORES
BUT NO SOONER IS THE PRIESTHOOD ENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS IS THE CASE IN THE UNITED STATES
THESE TWO CAUSES INDUCE THEM UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ADOPT POLITICAL DOCTRINES WHICH THEY WOULD PERHAPS SUPPORT WITH LESS ZEAL IF THEY WERE RICH AND PREPONDERANT
BUT IT SEEKS RATHER TO JUSTIFY ITS RESULTS THE PRIESTS IN AMERICA HAVE DIVIDED THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD INTO TWO PARTS IN THE ONE THEY PLACE THE DOCTRINES OF REVEALED RELIGION WHICH COMMAND THEIR ASSENT
HE PUBLISHED IN HARPER'S MAGAZINE THREE ARTICLES ABOUT HIS ADVENTURES IN SPAIN
HE WAS THUS ENABLED TO SUCCEED DUNCAN AS KING
OWING TO THE FACT THAT SINCE BECAUSE IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THOUGH ALTHOUGH CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT REMIND YOU NOTIFY YOU
I WAS UNAWARE OF THE FACT THAT I WAS UNAWARE THAT DID NOT KNOW THE FACT THAT HE HAD NOT SUCCEEDED HIS FAILURE THE FACT THAT I HAD ARRIVED MY ARRIVAL
COLONEL NELSON PAID US A VISIT YESTERDAY
BY SENTENCES LOOSE OR PERIODIC OF THREE CLAUSES WHICHEVER BEST REPRESENT THE REAL RELATIONS OF THE THOUGHT FIFTEEN EXPRESS CO ORDINATE IDEAS
AS THE WATERS COVER THE SEA THESE CONDITIONS DID NOT PREVAIL IN THE TIME OF THE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST
IN BOTH THE EXAMPLES ABOVE BEFORE CORRECTION THE WORD PROPERLY RELATED TO THE SECOND PASSIVE IS MADE THE SUBJECT OF THE FIRST A COMMON FAULT
THE CORRECTED VERSION CONSEQUENTLY IS SIMPLY A GUESS AT THE WRITER'S INTENTION ALL THREE EXAMPLES SHOW THE WEAKNESS INHERENT IN THE WORD NOT

SEE ALSO UNDER CASE CHARACTER NATURE SYSTEM
BUT APART FROM THIS HE SHOULD FOLLOW THE PRINCIPLE OF PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION
HAS THE APPEARANCE OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT FURTHER AND IS THE LEAST SPECIFIC OF CONNECTIVES USED BETWEEN INDEPENDENT CLAUSES IT INDICATES ONLY
CAST IRON IS CHANGED INTO STEEL THE OBJECTION IS THAT THE INTERPOSED PHRASE OR CLAUSE NEEDLESSLY INTERRUPTS THE NATURAL ORDER OF THE MAIN CLAUSE
IS CHANGED INTO STEEL BY TREATMENT IN A BESSEMER CONVERTER
THE SECOND INTRODUCED BY A CONJUNCTION OR RELATIVE ALTHOUGH SINGLE SENTENCES OF THIS TYPE MAY BE UNEXCEPTIONABLE SEE UNDER RULE FOUR A SERIES SOON BECOMES MONOTONOUS
SHOWS THAT THE WRITER HAS AT LEAST MADE HIS CHOICE AND ABIDED BY IT BY THIS PRINCIPLE
THEY SHOULD BE SO ARRANGED THAT NO WRONG RELATION IS SUGGESTED ALL THE MEMBERS WERE NOT PRESENT NOT ALL THE MEMBERS WERE PRESENT HE ONLY FOUND TWO MISTAKES
THIS RULE IS DIFFICULT TO APPLY IT IS FREQUENTLY HARD TO DECIDE WHETHER A SINGLE WORD SUCH AS HOWEVER OR A BRIEF PHRASE
THE LEOPARD AND THE KID AND THE LION AND THE CALF ONE OF THE GREAT EVENTS WHICH IS TO OCCUR IN THE DAY OF THE MANIFESTATION OF THAT
THEY AND THEIRS FOR A THOUSAND YEARS FOR THEY ARE LIKE FATHER AND CHILD MOTHER AND DAUGHTER SISTER AND BROTHER THIS IS ONE OF THE MEANINGS OF THE COMPANIONSHIP OF THE WOLF AND THE LAMB
WHO BECAME PRESIDENT IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE
HE USUALLY CAME LATE HE DID NOT THINK THAT STUDYING LATIN WAS MUCH USE HE THOUGHT THE STUDY OF LATIN USELESS THE TAMING OF THE SHREW IS RATHER WEAK IN SPOTS
IS A DELIBERATELY USED MEANS OF CREATING SUSPENSE SEE EXAMPLES UNDER RULE EIGHTEEN THE RELATIVE PRONOUN SHOULD COME AS A RULE IMMEDIATELY AFTER ITS ANTECEDENT
WHO IS WHICH WAS AND THE LIKE ARE OFTEN SUPERFLUOUS
MUST HE WRITE TWENTY CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES OF THE SAME PATTERN ON CLOSER EXAMINATION
AND TEDIOUS AN UNSKILFUL WRITER WILL SOMETIMES CONSTRUCT A WHOLE PARAGRAPH OF SENTENCES OF THIS KIND USING AS CONNECTIVES
THE FIRST WOULD BE THE RIGHT FORM IN A PARAGRAPH ON THE DRAMATISTS OF THE RESTORATION
BUT SUCH FORMS AS ACHILLES HEEL MOSES LAWS ISIS TEMPLE ARE COMMONLY REPLACED BY THE HEEL OF ACHILLES THE LAWS OF MOSES
ZOROASTRIANS BUDDHISTS HINDUS AND PERSIANS ALL ASSOCIATE TOGETHER WITH THE GREATEST FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE AS IF INDEED THESE PEOPLE HAD BEEN RELATED AND CONNECTED TOGETHER
TO REMOVE THE MONOTONY REPLACING THEM BY SIMPLE SENTENCES BY SENTENCES OF TWO CLAUSES JOINED BY A SEMICOLON BY PERIODIC SENTENCES OF TWO CLAUSES
THESE TWO INDEPENDENT ARGUMENTS FROM ALPINE TEMPERATURES AND FROM THOSE OF THE MOON SUPPORT AND ENFORCE EACH OTHER AND AFFORD A CONCLUSIVE PROOF AS AGAINST ANYTHING ADVANCED BY MISTER LOWELL THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF MARS MUST BE FAR TOO LOW TO SUPPORT ANIMAL LIFE
CONSTRUCTED BY INTELLIGENT BEINGS FOR THE SPECIAL PURPOSE OF CARRYING WATER TO THE MORE ARID REGIONS IS WHOLLY ERRONEOUS AND RATIONALLY INCONCEIVABLE I NOW PROCEED TO DISCUSS HIS MORE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION
NO RAIN AND TROPICAL REGIONS WHICH ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY DESERT
A THIRD INDEPENDENT ARGUMENT LEADING TO THE SAME RESULT IS DOCTOR JOHNSTONE STONEY'S PROOF
DOUBLING OF TELESCOPIC APERTURE THEY WERE SOON DETECTED BY OTHER OBSERVERS ESPECIALLY BY MISTER LOWELL IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
SLIPHER AT MISTER LOWELL'S OBSERVATORY
RECURRING NOW TO THE QUESTION OF CLIMATE WHICH IS ALL IMPORTANT MISTER LOWELL NEVER EVEN DISCUSSES THE ESSENTIAL POINT THE TEMPERATURE THAT MUST NECESSARILY RESULT FROM AN ATMOSPHERIC ENVELOPE
THROUGHOUT THEIR WHOLE LENGTH AND APPEARING AS MISTER LOWELL SAYS CLEAR CUT UPON THE DISC ITS TWIN LINES
SINCE THE GREATEST AMOUNT HE CAN GIVE TO IT IS NOT MORE THAN ABOUT FOUR INCHES OF BAROMETRIC PRESSURE AS WE RECKON IT
BUT IT DOES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT OR VERY NEARLY SO ON OUR LOFTY PLATEAUX OFTEN HUNDREDS OF MILES IN EXTENT IN PROPORTION TO THEIR ALTITUDE QUITO
AT ANALOGOUS FACTS AND POSSIBILITIES HE HAS DECLARED THEM TO BE NON NATURAL' THEREFORE TO BE WORKS OF ART THEREFORE TO NECESSITATE THE PRESENCE OF HIGHLY INTELLIGENT BEINGS
AND THE MORE RUDDY AND BRIGHTER PORTIONS AS LAND FURTHER INCREASED ADDED TO THIS A DAY ONLY ABOUT HALF AN HOUR LONGER THAN OUR OWN AND A SUCCESSION OF SEASONS OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS OURS BUT OF NEARLY DOUBLE THE LENGTH OWING TO ITS MUCH LONGER YEAR
EVER OCCUR AT LOWLAND STATIONS EVEN WITH THE BEST INSTRUMENTS AND ALMOST ALL ARE SEEN TO BE AS PERFECTLY STRAIGHT AS IF DRAWN WITH A RULER THE DOUBLE CANALS
CHAPTER EIGHT SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION THIS LITTLE VOLUME HAS NECESSARILY TOUCHED UPON A GREAT VARIETY OF SUBJECTS IN ORDER TO DEAL IN A TOLERABLY COMPLETE MANNER WITH THE VERY
AS PECULIAR IN ORIGIN AND INTERNAL STRUCTURE AS IT IS IN ITS SURFACE FEATURES
BOTH AS TO THE HABITABILITY OF MARS AND AS TO ITS BEING ACTUALLY INHABITED BY BEINGS COMPARABLE WITH OURSELVES IN INTELLECT THE LARGER PART OF THE WORK IS IN FACT DEVOTED TO A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HE TERMS
IN ATTEMPTING TO SHOW THAT THESE ESSENTIALS ACTUALLY EXIST ON MARS HE IS NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL HE ADDUCES EVIDENCE OF AN ATMOSPHERE BUT OF AN EXCEEDINGLY SCANTY ONE
THE NON NATURAL FEATURES OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE INCLUDING ESPECIALLY
IT WAS FULLY RECOGNISED THAT A REGULAR COURSE OF CHANGE OCCURRED DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESSION OF THE SEASONS
WHICH TO HIM SEEM TO DEMONSTRATE THE INTERVENTION OF INTELLIGENT BEINGS WORKING FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT
AS EXAMPLES HE NEVER EVEN DISCUSSES THE TOTALLY INADEQUATE WATER SUPPLY FOR SUCH WORLDWIDE IRRIGATION OR THE EXTREME IRRATIONALITY OF CONSTRUCTING SO VAST A CANAL SYSTEM THE WASTE FROM WHICH BY EVAPORATION
HOW DID THE INHABITANTS EVER REACH A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE POPULATION WITH SURPLUS FOOD AND LEISURE ENABLING THEM TO RISE FROM THE LOW CONDITION OF SAVAGES TO ONE OF CIVILISATION AND ULTIMATELY TO SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN FAIRLY GRAPPLED WITH AND SOME ATTEMPT MADE TO SHOW WHY IT SHOULD NOT APPLY TO MARS EXCEPT THE WEAK REMARK THAT ON A LEVEL SURFACE
BUT THERE IS A VERY WEIGHTY ARGUMENT DEPENDING ON THE MOLECULAR THEORY OF GASES AGAINST THE POLAR CAPS OF MARS BEING COMPOSED OF FROZEN WATER AT ALL THE MASS AND ELASTIC FORCE OF THE SEVERAL GASES IS DUE TO THE GREATER
THE CANALS DISCOVERED BY SCHIAPARELLI
BUT HE NEVER CONSIDERS THE DIFFICULTIES THIS IMPLIES EVERYWHERE THESE CANALS RUN FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES ACROSS WATERLESS DESERTS FORMING A SYSTEM AND INDICATING A PURPOSE THE WONDERFUL PERFECTION OF WHICH
WHILE IT IS CERTAIN THAT LONG BEFORE HALF OF THEM WERE COMPLETED THEIR FAILURE TO BE OF ANY USE WOULD HAVE LED ANY RATIONAL BEINGS TO CEASE CONSTRUCTING THEM HE ALSO FAILS TO CONSIDER THE DIFFICULTY THAT
WITH A DENSER ATMOSPHERE THIS EFFECT IS FURTHER INTENSIFIED BY THE FACT THAT A LESS DENSE CANNOT ABSORB AND TRANSMIT SO MUCH HEAT AS A MORE DENSE ATMOSPHERE
AND WATERLESS CONDITION WATER VAPOUR CANNOT EXIST ON MARS NOW DOCTOR STONEY FINDS THAT IN ORDER TO RETAIN WATER VAPOUR PERMANENTLY A PLANET MUST HAVE A MASS
AND OTHER OBSERVERS FOUND BY LATER AND EQUALLY FAVOURABLE OBSERVATIONS THAT THEY REALLY WERE DISCOVERY OF THE DOUBLE CANALS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE ANOTHER STRANGE FEATURE WAS DISCOVERED BY SCHIAPARELLI
BESIDES DOING MUCH VALUABLE ASTRONOMICAL WORK ON OTHER PLANETS
AND OF PHYSICAL LAWS THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THAT FOR ANY HIGH FORM OF ORGANIC LIFE CERTAIN CONDITIONS WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL ON OUR EARTH MUST ALSO EXIST IN MARS
TO PUT THE WHOLE CASE IN THE FEWEST POSSIBLE WORDS
ALL THE GASES COMPOSING ITS ATMOSPHERE BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO RETAIN HYDROGEN AND AS A CONSEQUENCE
MISTER LOWELL PUBLISHED AN ILLUSTRATED VOLUME GIVING A FULL ACCOUNT OF HIS OBSERVATIONS OF MARS
TO BE SURE NICHOLAS HIGGINS THE FATHER SPOKE DIFFERENTLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED A COMMITTEE MAN AND SAID THAT HE KNEW SECRETS OF WHICH THE EXOTERIC KNEW NOTHING HE SAID THIS MORE EXPRESSLY AND PARTICULARLY
FROM HIS POSITION HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT WITHOUT THEIR WORDS BUT HERE WAS THIS MAN FROM A DISTANT COUNTY WHO WAS PERPLEXED BY THE WORKINGS OF THE SYSTEM
APROPOS OF THE SERVANT THAT MISSUS THORNTON HAD PROMISED TO INQUIRE ABOUT BESSY QUITE ROUSED UP AT THE INTELLIGENCE DEAR AND ARE YOU GOING TO DINE AT THORNTON'S AT MARLBOROUGH MILLS YES BESSY
BESSY'S CHEEKS FLUSHED A LITTLE AT HER THOUGHT BEING THUS EASILY READ WELL SAID SHE YO SEE THEY THINKEN A DEAL O MONEY HERE AND I RECKON YO'VE NOT GETTEN MUCH NO SAID MARGARET
I TELL YO AGAIN I SAW YO AS PLAINLY COMING SWIFTLY TOWARDS ME WI YO'R HAIR BLOWN BACK WI THE VERY SWIFTNESS O THE MOTION
FOR IT JUST MAKES MY HEART WARM TO YO MORE AND MORE BESSY SEEMED MUCH QUIETER TO DAY BUT FEARFULLY LANGUID AND EXHAUSTED AS SHE FINISHED SPEAKING SHE LOOKED SO FAINT AND WEARY
I WISH I KNEW WHAT YOU OUGHT TO WEAR SAID MISSUS HALE NERVOUSLY MARGARET'S MANNER CHANGED INSTANTLY SHALL I GO AND PUT THEM ON ONE AFTER ANOTHER MAMMA AND THEN YOU COULD SEE WHICH YOU LIKED BEST
MISSUS HALE WAS CURIOUSLY AMUSED AND INTERESTED BY THE IDEA OF THE THORNTON DINNER PARTY SHE KEPT WONDERING ABOUT THE DETAILS WITH SOMETHING OF THE SIMPLICITY OF A LITTLE CHILD WHO WANTS TO HAVE ALL ITS ANTICIPATED PLEASURES
AND I'M ALL IN A SWOUNDING DAZE TO DAY ONLY YON POOR CHAP MADE ME ALIVE AGAIN NO IT'S NOT DEATH YET BUT DEATH IS NOT FAR OFF AY COVER ME UP AND I'LL MAY BE SLEEP
WITH AN ANXIOUS LOOK AT MARGARET'S PRINT GOWN WHICH HER MILTON EYES APPRAISED AT SEVENPENCE A YARD MARGARET'S FACE DIMPLED UP INTO A MERRY LAUGH THANK YOU BESSY FOR THINKING SO KINDLY ABOUT MY LOOKING NICE AMONG ALL THE SMART PEOPLE
BUT MORE BEING WOMEN KEPT PLAINING PLAINING WI THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN THEIR CHEEKS AND NEVER WIPED AWAY NOR HEEDED
LET ME COME AND SEE YO IN IT I WANT TO SEE YO AND TOUCH YO AS IN VERY DEED YO WERE IN MY DREAM MY DEAR BESSY IT IS QUITE A FANCY OF YOURS FANCY OR NO FANCY YO'VE COME
AY CLEMMING FIVE SHILLING A WEEK MAY DO WELL ENOUGH FOR THEE WI BUT TWO MOUTHS TO FILL AND ONE ON EM A WENCH WHO CAN WELLY EARN HER OWN MEAT
THEY'LL WIN THE DAY SEE IF THEY DUNNOT NOT ONE WORD HAD MARGARET OR BESSY SPOKEN THEY HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE SIGHING
I SHOULD LIKE TO GET SPEECH O THEM WHEN THEY'RE A BIT INCLINED TO SIT STILL AFTER DINNER
AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE THE POWER OF HELPING ONE WHOM SHE EVIDENTLY REGARDED AS HAVING A CLAIM UPON THEM BESIDES SHE WENT ON FATHER IS SURE AND POSITIVE THE MASTERS MUST GIVE IN WITHIN THESE NEXT FEW DAYS
THAT MARGARET BECAME ALARMED IT'S NOUT SAID BESSY IT'S NOT DEATH YET I HAD A FEARFU NIGHT WI DREAMS OR SOMEWHAT LIKE DREAMS FOR I WERE WIDE AWAKE
BEFORE MARGARET COULD ANSWER HIGGINS BROKE OUT THORNTON'S AR T GOING TO DINE AT THORNTON'S
SHE SAID BOUCHER'S BEEN IN THESE DAYS PAST A TELLING ME OF HIS FEARS AND HIS TROUBLES
AN IF SORROW COMES TO THEM THEY LOVE IT HURTS EM AS SORE AS E'ER IT DID SOLOMON I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT
SAID BESSY I RECKON
BESSY SHUT HER EYES AND ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE SOOTHED AT LAST SHE SAID
AS WELL AS OTHERS DID NOT MANY A ONE THE BIBLE AY AND SEE VISIONS TOO WHY
AND THE MASTERS HAS MADE NO END O MONEY HOW MUCH FATHER DOESN'T KNOW
THE WAY THEY KEEP ON GRINNING AND FIGHTING AT EACH OTHER TILL EVEN WHILE THEY FIGHT THEY ARE PICKED OFF INTO THE PIT JUST THEN NICHOLAS HIGGINS CAME IN HE CAUGHT HIS DAUGHTER'S LAST WORDS AY
THEY HAD BEEN SMOTHERED AND KEPT DOWN BUT THEY WERE NOT EXTINCT AND SHE LIKED TO THINK OF SEEING MARGARET DRESSED FOR A PARTY AND DISCUSSED WHAT SHE SHOULD WEAR WITH AN UNSETTLED ANXIETY THAT AMUSED MARGARET WHO HAD BEEN MORE ACCUSTOMED TO SOCIETY
AND EACH WAS EAGER TO MAKE HIM A JUDGE AND TO BRING WITNESS OF HIS OWN CAUSES FOR IRRITATION THEN MISTER HALE BROUGHT ALL HIS BUDGET OF GRIEVANCES AND LAID IT BEFORE MISTER THORNTON FOR HIM WITH HIS EXPERIENCE AS A MASTER
GOOD BYE SAID MARGARET HASTILY GOOD BYE BESSY I SHALL LOOK TO SEE YOU ON THE TWENTY FIRST IF YOU'RE WELL ENOUGH THE MEDICINES AND TREATMENT WHICH DOCTOR DONALDSON HAD ORDERED FOR MISSUS HALE
AND IS NOT SO BAD OFF LEASTWAYS DOES NOT SHOW IT AS HE DOES BUT FATHER WON'T LET EM WANT NOW HE KNOWS YO SEE BOUCHER'S BEEN PULLED DOWN WI HIS CHILDER AND HER BEING SO CRANKY
BUT YES PERHAPS THAT WILL BE BEST SO OFF MARGARET WENT SHE WAS VERY MUCH INCLINED TO PLAY SOME PRANKS WHEN SHE WAS DRESSED UP AT SUCH AN UNUSUAL HOUR
IN WHICH HE LAID DOWN AXIOMS OF TRADE AND SERENELY FOLLOWED THEM OUT TO THEIR FULL CONSEQUENCES THE DISCORD JARRED UPON HER INEXPRESSIBLY THE MORE BECAUSE OF THE GATHERING WOE OF WHICH SHE HEARD FROM BESSY
NICHOLAS SAW HER COME IN AND GREETED HER WITH A GRUFF BUT NOT UNFRIENDLY NOD MARY HURRIED OUT OF THE HOUSE CATCHING GLADLY AT THE OPEN DOOR AND CRYING ALOUD WHEN SHE GOT AWAY FROM HER FATHER'S PRESENCE
WAS NOT ALWAYS SO BARBAROUS I HAD TAKEN TO MY CLASS ON THE PRECEDING WEEK SOME SPECIMENS OF FERNS NEATLY GUMMED ON WHITE PAPER THIS TIME I TOOK A PIECE OF COAL SHALE WITH IMPRESSIONS OF FERNS TO SHOW THEM
THE ACCOUNT OF HIS MIDNIGHT RIDE TO WARN HIS ENEMY OF AN IMPENDING ATTACK OF MOONLIGHTERS IS MOST POWERFUL AND SPIRITED AND IT IS PLEASANT TO MEET IN MODERN FICTION A CHARACTER THAT HAS ALL THE FINE INCONSISTENCIES OF LIFE AND IS NEITHER TOO FANTASTIC AN EXCEPTION TO BE TRUE
I TOLD EACH TO EXAMINE THE SPECIMEN AND TELL ME WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS W GAVE SO BRIGHT A SMILE THAT I SAW HE KNEW NONE OF THE OTHERS COULD TELL HE SAID THEY WERE FERNS LIKE WHAT I SHOWED THEM LAST WEEK BUT HE THOUGHT THEY WERE CHISELLED ON THE STONE
AND TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE CURRANT JELLY AT A VERY CRITICAL MOMENT SHE OWED THE AFFECTION OF SOME OF HER HUSBAND'S RELATIVES WHO UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN RATHER PREJUDICED AGAINST HER ON THE GROUND THAT SHE WAS MERELY AN UNPRACTICAL BLUE STOCKING
THIS NOTE OF REALISM IN DEALING WITH NATIONAL TYPES OF CHARACTER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC OF IRISH FICTION FROM THE DAYS OF MISS EDGEWORTH DOWN TO OUR OWN DAYS
INDEED SHE RATHER INCLINED TO BACON'S OPINION THAT UNMARRIED PEOPLE DO THE BEST PUBLIC WORK IT IS QUITE STRIKING SHE SAYS IN ONE OF HER LETTERS TO OBSERVE HOW MUCH THE USEFUL POWER AND INFLUENCE OF WOMAN HAS DEVELOPED OF LATE YEARS
HE WAS CHARGED ALONG WITH BOILEAU WITH THE TASK OF REVISING THE TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION AND RULES OF MADAME DE MAINTENON'S GREAT COLLEGE
THOUGH TO QUOTE HER OWN WORDS SHE WAS GRIEVED TO FIND THAT THE LARK WHICH AT HEAVEN'S GATE SINGS IS THOUGHT UNWORTHY OF MAN'S PROTECTION AND SHE TOOK A GREAT FANCY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO ON BEING TOLD OF THE NUMBER OF SINGING BIRDS THAT IS EATEN IN ITALY
AND IT IS NO DOUBT QUITE RIGHT THAT THE SAINTS SHOULD TAKE THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY IT IS ONLY FAIR ALSO TO REMEMBER THAT HER WORK OF RESCUE AND REFORMATION WAS CARRIED ON UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTIES
IS ANALYSED WITH MUCH SUBTLETY THE ESSAY ON MARINO ALSO IS FULL OF INTEREST WE HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WHETHER THOSE WHO TALK SO GLIBLY OF EUPHUISM AND MARINISM IN LITERATURE HAVE EVER READ EITHER EUPHUES OR THE ADONE
IT WAS THE LAST THING WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR OF JOHN HALIFAX GENTLEMAN AND REACHED ME ONLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE HER LAMENTED DEATH THAT THE STATE OF THINGS IS SUCH AS MISSUS CRAIK DESCRIBES
THE CRITICAL SPIRIT BEGINS TO MANIFEST ITSELF AND LIFE IS NOT TREATED AS A MERE SPECTACLE BUT THE LAWS OF ITS EVOLUTION AND PROGRESS ARE INVESTIGATED ALSO WE ADMIT THAT THE DESIRE TO REPRESENT LIFE AT ALL COSTS UNDER DRAMATIC CONDITIONS
CULTURE IN ITS USE OF LANGUAGE COURAGE IN ITS SELECTION OF SUBJECT MATTER THE MODERN APOSTLE OF WHOM MISS NADEN SINGS IS A YOUNG CLERGYMAN WHO PREACHES PANTHEISTIC SOCIALISM IN THE FREE CHURCH OF SOME PROVINCIAL MANUFACTURING TOWN CONVERTS EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE WOMAN WHOM HE LOVES
AND THAT LITERATURE HAD NOT YET BECOME A MOUTHPIECE FOR THE UTTERANCES OF HUMANITY MEN APPRECIATED THE ARISTOCRACY OF INTELLECT BUT WITH THE DEMOCRACY OF SUFFERING THEY HAD NO SYMPATHY THE CRY FROM THE BRICKFIELDS HAD STILL TO BE HEARD
THE STORY OF MACBETH IMPRESSED THEM VERY MUCH THEY KNEW THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE HAVING SEEN HIS NAME OVER A PUBLIC HOUSE A BOY DEFINED CONSCIENCE AS A THING A GENTLEMAN HASN'T GOT WHO WHEN A BOY FINDS HIS PURSE AND GIVES IT BACK TO HIM
THE SARAH BERNHARDT TEA GOWN FOR INSTANCE FIGURED IN THE PRESENT ISSUE HAS MANY GOOD POINTS ABOUT IT AND THE GIGANTIC DRESS IMPROVER DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE REALLY ESSENTIAL TO THE MODE AND THOUGH THE POSTILLION COSTUME OF THE FANCY DRESS BALL
THE PLAIN GIRLS WHO WANT TO GO INTO CONVENTS THE PRETTY GIRLS WHO WANT TO GET MARRIED AND THE SHOPKEEPERS DAUGHTERS WHO WANT TO BE THOUGHT YOUNG LADIES THERE IS A WHOLE PELL MELL OF MEN AND WOMEN A COMPLETE PANORAMA OF PROVINCIAL LIFE
HOWEVER IT IS ONLY FAIR TO ADD THAT LADY BELLAIRS RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE OF SELF DEVELOPMENT QUITE AS MUCH AS THE IMPORTANCE OF SELF DENIAL AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SOUND SENSE IN EVERYTHING THAT SHE SAYS ABOUT THE GRADUAL GROWTH AND FORMATION OF CHARACTER INDEED
HAD BEEN NEGLECTED BY THEM AND HAD DIED OF STARVATION SHE WAS ALMOST HEART BROKEN AT THE EVENT AND IN WRITING HER RECOLLECTIONS SEVENTY YEARS AFTER
THEIR SURPRISE AND PLEASURE WERE GREAT WHEN I EXPLAINED THE MATTER TO THEM THE HISTORY OF JOSEPH THEY ALL FOUND A DIFFICULTY IN REALISING THAT THIS HAD ACTUALLY OCCURRED ONE ASKED IF EGYPT EXISTED NOW AND IF PEOPLE LIVED IN IT
SHE UNDERWENT ALL THE USUAL TORTURES OF BACK BOARDS IRON COLLARS AND DUMBS AND ALSO BECAUSE SHE WAS A VERY TINY PERSON THE UNUSUAL ONE OF BEING HUNG BY THE NECK TO DRAW OUT THE MUSCLES AND INCREASE THE GROWTH A SIGNAL FAILURE IN HER CASE
DOESN'T GIVE THE BOY SIXPENCE ANOTHER BOY WAS ASKED AFTER A SUNDAY EVENING LECTURE ON THANKFULNESS WHAT PLEASURE HE ENJOYED MOST IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR HE REPLIED CANDIDLY COCK FIGHTIN MA'AM THERE'S A PIT UP BY THE BLACK BOY AS IS WORTH ANYTHINK IN BRISSEL
AND BECOMING MISSUS SOMERVILLE'S CONSTANT COMPANION SHE WAS ALSO VERY ENERGETIC PHYLLIS BROWNE TELLS US IN TRYING TO GET A LAW PASSED IN THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANIMALS AND SAID ONCE WITH REFERENCE TO THIS SUBJECT
FOR A WAIST NOWADAYS SEEMS TO BE REGARDED AS AN ARTICLE OF APPAREL TO BE PUT ON WHEN AND WHERE ONE LIKES A LONG WAIST ALWAYS IMPLIES SHORTNESS OF THE LOWER LIMBS AND FROM THE ARTISTIC POINT OF VIEW HAS THE EFFECT OF DIMINISHING THE HEIGHT
HER OWN ARTISTIC FEELING MAY INDUCE HER TO RECONSIDER HER RESOLUTION TO ABANDON EASTERN FOR WESTERN COSTUME I HOPE THAT SOME OF MY READERS WILL INTEREST THEMSELVES IN THE MINISTERING CHILDREN'S LEAGUE
WE HAVE OFTEN HAD OCCASION TO DIFFER FROM MISTER SYMONDS ON QUESTIONS OF DETAIL AND WE HAVE MORE THAN ONCE FELT IT OUR DUTY TO PROTEST AGAINST THE RHETORIC AND OVER EMPHASIS OF HIS STYLE BUT WE FULLY RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS WORK
NOT AS A TRIBUTE TO THE DISTINGUISHED MATHEMATICIAN BUT AS A RECOGNITION OF THE EXCELLENCE OF SOME ORANGE MARMALADE WHICH THE DISTINGUISHED MATHEMATICIAN HAD PREPARED WITH HER OWN HANDS AND PRESENTED TO THE SHIPS BEFORE THEY LEFT ENGLAND
WHEREFORE HE LEFT HIS FEASTS AND MINIONS DEAR AND JUSTLY RULED AND DIED A SAINT IN NAME BUT WHEN HIS HASTING SPIRIT HEAVENWARD CAME A STERN VOICE CRIED
THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT CONSISTS OF THE SAME CONSTITUENTS BECAUSE THE RELATION OF JUDGING PLACES THE CONSTITUENTS IN A DIFFERENT ORDER IN THE TWO CASES SIMILARLY IF CASSIO JUDGES THAT DESDEMONA LOVES OTHELLO THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE JUDGEMENT ARE STILL THE SAME
IN THESE CHARACTERISTICS THE PRINCIPLE OF INDUCTION DOES NOT STAND ALONE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER PRINCIPLES WHICH CANNOT BE PROVED OR DISPROVED BY EXPERIENCE BUT ARE USED IN ARGUMENTS WHICH START FROM WHAT IS EXPERIENCED
HENCE IT WILL BE BETTER TO SEEK FOR A THEORY OF BELIEF WHICH DOES NOT MAKE IT CONSIST IN A RELATION OF THE MIND TO A SINGLE OBJECT IT IS COMMON TO THINK OF RELATIONS AS THOUGH THEY ALWAYS HELD BETWEEN TWO TERMS BUT IN FACT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE
WHICH IS COMPOSED EXCLUSIVELY OF THE OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF IN THE SAME ORDER AS THEY HAD IN THE BELIEF WITH THE RELATION WHICH WAS ONE OF THE OBJECTS OCCURRING NOW AS THE CEMENT THAT BINDS TOGETHER THE OTHER OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF
WERE SUBJECTED TO THE TEST OF COHERENCE WE SHOULD FIND THAT IF WE CHOOSE TO SUPPOSE IT FALSE NOTHING WILL ANY LONGER BE INCOHERENT WITH ANYTHING ELSE THUS THE LAWS OF LOGIC SUPPLY THE SKELETON OR FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH THE TEST OF COHERENCE APPLIES AND THEY THEMSELVES
THUS THE SCOPE AND POWER OF A PRIORI PRINCIPLES IS STRICTLY LIMITED ALL KNOWLEDGE THAT SOMETHING EXISTS MUST BE IN PART DEPENDENT ON EXPERIENCE WHEN ANYTHING IS KNOWN IMMEDIATELY ITS EXISTENCE IS KNOWN BY EXPERIENCE ALONE WHEN ANYTHING IS PROVED TO EXIST WITHOUT BEING KNOWN IMMEDIATELY
AND THIS THOUGH NOT LOGICALLY REFUTABLE IS A THEORY TO BE AVOIDED IF POSSIBLE THUS IT IS EASIER TO ACCOUNT FOR FALSEHOOD IF WE TAKE JUDGEMENT TO BE A RELATION IN WHICH THE MIND AND THE VARIOUS OBJECTS CONCERNED ALL OCCUR SEVERALLY
AND THAT AMONG THEM ARE THE PROPOSITIONS OF LOGIC AND PURE MATHEMATICS AS WELL AS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS OF ETHICS THE QUESTION WHICH MUST NEXT OCCUPY US IS THIS HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH KNOWLEDGE AND MORE PARTICULARLY
WHICH SHALL NOT CONSIST IN RELATION TO SOMETHING WHOLLY OUTSIDE BELIEF THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTEMPT AT A DEFINITION OF THIS SORT IS THE THEORY THAT TRUTH CONSISTS IN COHERENCE IT IS SAID THAT THE MARK OF FALSEHOOD IS FAILURE TO COHERE IN THE BODY OF OUR BELIEFS
WHEN SWIFT INVITES US TO CONSIDER THE RACE OF STRULDBUGS WHO NEVER DIE WE ARE ABLE TO ACQUIESCE IN IMAGINATION BUT A WORLD WHERE TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE SEEMS QUITE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL WE FEEL THAT SUCH A WORLD IF THERE WERE ONE WOULD UPSET THE WHOLE FABRIC OF OUR KNOWLEDGE
BOTH EXPERIENCE AND A PRIORI PRINCIPLES MUST BE REQUIRED IN THE PROOF KNOWLEDGE IS CALLED EMPIRICAL WHEN IT RESTS WHOLLY OR PARTLY UPON EXPERIENCE THUS ALL KNOWLEDGE WHICH ASSERTS EXISTENCE IS EMPIRICAL AND THE ONLY A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING EXISTENCE IS HYPOTHETICAL
WHICH WE MAY INDICATE BY MEANS OF THE ORDER OF THE WORDS IN THE SENTENCE IN AN INFLECTED LANGUAGE THE SAME THING WILL BE INDICATED BY INFLECTIONS E G BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOMINATIVE AND ACCUSATIVE OTHELLO'S JUDGEMENT THAT CASSIO LOVES DESDEMONA DIFFERS FROM HIS JUDGEMENT
IF SOCRATES IS NOT ONE OF THE MEN ON WHOM OUR INDUCTION IS BASED WE SHALL STILL DO BETTER TO ARGUE STRAIGHT FROM OUR A B C TO SOCRATES THAN TO GO ROUND BY THE GENERAL PROPOSITION ALL MEN ARE MORTAL FOR THE PROBABILITY THAT SOCRATES IS MORTAL IS GREATER ON OUR DATA
IT MUST BE ADMITTED FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED THAT LOGICAL PRINCIPLES ARE KNOWN TO US AND CANNOT BE THEMSELVES PROVED BY EXPERIENCE SINCE ALL PROOF PRESUPPOSES THEM IN THIS THEREFORE WHICH WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF THE CONTROVERSY THE RATIONALISTS WERE IN THE RIGHT
THE SUBJECT AND THE OBJECTS TOGETHER ARE CALLED THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE JUDGEMENT IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT THE RELATION OF JUDGING HAS WHAT IS CALLED A SENSE OR DIRECTION WE MAY SAY METAPHORICALLY THAT IT PUTS ITS OBJECTS IN A CERTAIN ORDER
IF A CORRECT THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE IS TO BE OBTAINED FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THEM RAISES INTERESTING AND DIFFICULT QUESTIONS IN ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IS THAT FIRST OF ALL WE REALIZE SOME PARTICULAR APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE
INDUCTION IS ALWAYS THEORETICALLY PREFERABLE AND WARRANTS A GREATER CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUTH OF OUR CONCLUSION BECAUSE ALL EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS ARE MORE UNCERTAIN THAN THE INSTANCES OF THEM WE HAVE NOW SEEN THAT THERE ARE PROPOSITIONS KNOWN A PRIORI
THIS IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE PRINCIPLES WE HAVE ALREADY DEALT WITH SUCH AS IF THIS IS TRUE AND THIS IMPLIES THAT THEN THAT IS TRUE OR IF THIS AND THAT HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY FOUND CONNECTED THEY WILL PROBABLY BE CONNECTED IN THE NEXT INSTANCE IN WHICH ONE OF THEM IS FOUND
IT WOULD NOT CONTAIN ANY TRUTHS IN THE SENSE IN WHICH TRUTHS ARE THINGS OF THE SAME KIND AS FALSEHOODS IN FACT TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD ARE PROPERTIES OF BELIEFS AND STATEMENTS HENCE A WORLD OF MERE MATTER SINCE IT WOULD CONTAIN NO BELIEFS OR STATEMENTS WOULD ALSO CONTAIN
NOW IN ORDER TO KNOW WHETHER TWO PROPOSITIONS CAN BOTH BE TRUE WE MUST KNOW SUCH TRUTHS AS THE LAW OF CONTRADICTION FOR EXAMPLE THE TWO PROPOSITIONS THIS TREE IS A BEECH AND THIS TREE IS NOT A BEECH ARE NOT COHERENT BECAUSE OF THE LAW OF CONTRADICTION
WHEREVER THERE IS A RELATION WHICH RELATES CERTAIN TERMS THERE IS A COMPLEX OBJECT FORMED OF THE UNION OF THOSE TERMS AND CONVERSELY WHEREVER THERE IS A COMPLEX OBJECT THERE IS A RELATION WHICH RELATES ITS CONSTITUENTS WHEN AN ACT OF BELIEVING OCCURS THERE IS A COMPLEX IN WHICH
ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN A BELIEF IS FALSE THERE IS NO SUCH COMPLEX UNITY COMPOSED ONLY OF THE OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF IF OTHELLO BELIEVES FALSELY THAT DESDEMONA LOVES CASSIO THEN THERE IS NO SUCH COMPLEX UNITY AS DESDEMONA'S LOVE FOR CASSIO
AS OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GEOGRAPHY THEY MAINTAINED THAT BY THE REPEATED EXPERIENCE OF SEEING TWO THINGS AND TWO OTHER THINGS AND FINDING THAT ALTOGETHER THEY MADE FOUR THINGS WE WERE LED BY INDUCTION TO THE CONCLUSION THAT TWO THINGS AND TWO OTHER THINGS WOULD ALWAYS MAKE FOUR THINGS ALTOGETHER
NOW SUCH AN ARGUMENT IS NOT HARD TO FOLLOW AND IF IT IS GRANTED THAT ITS PREMISSES ARE TRUE IN FACT NO ONE WILL DENY THAT THE CONCLUSION MUST ALSO BE TRUE BUT IT DEPENDS FOR ITS TRUTH UPON AN INSTANCE OF A GENERAL LOGICAL PRINCIPLE
MAINTAINED THAT IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE KNOW BY EXPERIENCE THERE ARE CERTAIN INNATE IDEAS AND INNATE PRINCIPLES WHICH WE KNOW INDEPENDENTLY OF EXPERIENCE IT HAS NOW BECOME POSSIBLE TO DECIDE WITH SOME CONFIDENCE AS TO THE TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD OF THESE OPPOSING SCHOOLS
THUS ALTHOUGH TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD ARE PROPERTIES OF BELIEFS YET THEY ARE IN A SENSE EXTRINSIC PROPERTIES FOR THE CONDITION OF THE TRUTH OF A BELIEF IS SOMETHING NOT INVOLVING BELIEFS OR IN GENERAL ANY MIND AT ALL BUT ONLY THE OBJECTS OF THE BELIEF
DOGS AS DESTROYERS OF BIRDS I HAVE RECEIVED MANY LETTERS FROM PROTECTORS OF WILD LIFE INFORMING ME THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF GROUND NESTING BIRDS AND ESPECIALLY OF UPLAND GAME BIRDS BY ROAMING DOGS
THAT WE NEED LOSE ANY SLEEP OVER THEM INDEED I THINK THAT TODAY IT WOULD BE A MIGHTY GOOD COLLECTOR WHO COULD FIND ONE SPECIMEN IN SEVEN DAYS HUNTING LIKE ALL OTHER SPECIES THESE TOO ARE BEING SHOT OUT OF OUR BIRD FAUNA
AND CLAIM COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS THEY MAY WELL BE SET DOWN AS ONE OF THE UNSEEN FORCES DESTRUCTIVE TO BIRDS NATURALLY WE ASK WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT
THEY ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IN A DAY AND QUICKLY LEARN WHERE TO SEEK EASY GAME AND GOOD COVER IN THE DAYTIME THEY LIE CLOSE IN THE THICK BRUSH EXACTLY AS TIGERS DO IN INDIA BUT IF NOT MOLESTED FOR A PERIOD OF DAYS THEY BECOME BOLD
FOR THEY LIKE THE LYNX AND EAGLE HAVE NOTHING TO LIVE UPON SAVE THE GAME THE WOLVES AND COYOTES HAVE LEARNED TO SEEK THE RANGES OF CATTLE HORSES AND SHEEP WHERE THEY STILL DO IMMENSE DAMAGE CHIEFLY IN KILLING YOUNG STOCK
ARE ABSOLUTELY SICKENING THE NUMBER OF BIRDS KILLED BY THEM IN THIS STATE IS APPALLING SOME CAT LOVERS BELIEVE THAT EACH CAT KILLS ON THE AVERAGE NOT MORE THAN TEN BIRDS A YEAR BUT I HAVE LEARNED OF TWO INSTANCES
AND APPROACHING SANCHO THREW OVER HIM A ROBE OF BLACK BUCKRAM PAINTED ALL OVER WITH FLAMES OF FIRE AND TAKING OFF HIS CAP PUT UPON HIS HEAD A MITRE SUCH AS THOSE UNDERGOING THE SENTENCE OF THE HOLY OFFICE WEAR
NOR DO THESE CARRY ME OFF DON QUIXOTE SURVEYED HIM TOO AND THOUGH FEAR HAD GOT THE BETTER OF HIS FACULTIES HE COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE THE FIGURE SANCHO PRESENTED
THE HORSEMEN DISMOUNTED AND TOGETHER WITH THE MEN ON FOOT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY TAKING UP SANCHO AND DON QUIXOTE BODILY THEY CARRIED THEM INTO THE COURT
BECAUSE THERE ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TIMES AS MANY OF THEM AND THOSE THAT HUNT ARE NOT AFRAID TO HUNT IN THE DAYTIME OF COURSE
AGAINST TELEGRAPH WIRES AND AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO BEGIN WOULD BE ALONG THE LINE
BUT AS THEY DID NOT BURN HIM HE DID NOT CARE TWO FARTHINGS FOR THEM HE TOOK OFF THE MITRE AND SEEING PAINTED WITH DEVILS HE PUT IT ON AGAIN SAYING TO HIMSELF WELL SO FAR THOSE DON'T BURN ME
THE LADY IN QUESTION ASSURED ME THAT TO HER CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE THAT PARTICULAR CAT WOULD WATCH A NESTFUL OF YOUNG ROBINS WEEK AFTER WEEK
ON ONE SIDE OF THE COURT WAS ERECTED A STAGE WHERE UPON TWO CHAIRS WERE SEATED TWO PERSONS WHO FROM HAVING CROWNS ON THEIR HEADS AND SCEPTRES IN THEIR HANDS APPEARED TO BE KINGS OF SOME SORT
WELL WILL TOLD ME NEVER TO OVERLOOK A HOUSE CAT THAT I FOUND AS FAR AS A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM A FARM OR RANCH FOR IF THEY HAVE NOT ALREADY TURNED WILD THEY ARE LEARNING HOW EASY IT IS TO HUNT AND LIVE ON GAME AND ARE ALMOST AS BAD
IN WHICH TO STRIKE THE HUNTING CATS IN THE OPEN AND IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHILE THIS CHAPTER WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE COMPOSITORS THE HUNTING CAT AND GRAY RABBIT SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING ILLUSTRATION WERE BROUGHT IN BY A KEEPER
ANY FARMER CAN EASILY WIN ENOUGH BOUNTIES TO MORE THAN PAY THE COST OF HIS ANNUAL HUNTING LICENSE ONE DOLLAR AND THE FARMERS BOYS WILL FIND A NEW INTEREST IN LIFE
IS QUITE SWEEPING AT THE SAME TIME MISTER RAYMOND L DITMARS POINTS OUT THE FACT THAT THIS SERPENT FEEDS DURING SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR ON MICE
THOUGH THE DEVIL SHOULD CARRY ME OFF HERE DON QUIXOTE TOO BROKE SILENCE SAYING TO SANCHO HAVE PATIENCE MY SON AND GRATIFY THESE NOBLE PERSONS AND GIVE ALL THANKS TO HEAVEN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COURT WAS A CATAFALQUE RAISED ABOUT TWO YARDS ABOVE THE GROUND AND COVERED COMPLETELY BY AN IMMENSE CANOPY OF BLACK VELVET AND ON THE STEPS ALL ROUND IT WHITE WAX TAPERS
AND GIVE HIM TWELVE PINCHES AND SIX PIN THRUSTS IN THE BACK AND ARMS
FOR THEIR DESTRUCTIVENESS OF USEFUL BIRDS WITHOUT ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WORTH MENTIONING FOUR OF THESE ARE COOPER'S HAWK THE SHARP SHINNED HAWK PIGEON HAWK AND DUCK HAWK FORTUNATELY THESE SPECIES ARE NOT SO NUMEROUS
THEY WATCHED IT THROUGH ONE SEASON AND FOUND THAT IT KILLED FIFTY EIGHT BIRDS INCLUDING THE YOUNG IN FIVE NESTS NEARLY A HUNDRED CORRESPONDENTS SCATTERED THROUGH ALL THE COUNTIES OF THE STATE
FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF WOLVES IN MANY MANY PLACES THE GRAY WOLF STILL PERSISTS AND CAN NOT BE EXTERMINATED TO THE STOCKMEN OF THE WEST THE WOLF QUESTION IS A SERIOUS MATTER THE STOCKMEN OF MONTANA SAY THAT A GOVERNMENT EXPERT ONCE TOLD THEM HOW TO GET RID OF THE GRAY WOLVES
WHEN A CROW NESTED IN OUR WOODS NEAR THE BEAVER POND WE WERE GREATLY PLEASED BUT WITH THE FEEDING OF THE FIRST BROOD
HER BEAUTY AND HER SORROWS WILL I SING
WHEN I WAS A BOY IN MY TEENS I HAD A LASTING SERIES OF OBJECT LESSONS ON THE CAT AS A PREDATORY ANIMAL OUR BETTY WAS THE MOST AMBITIOUS AND SUCCESSFUL DOMESTIC CAT HUNTER OF WILD MAMMALS
BURNED IN MORE THAN A HUNDRED SILVER CANDLESTICKS UPON THE CATAFALQUE WAS SEEN THE DEAD BODY OF A DAMSEL SO LOVELY THAT BY HER BEAUTY SHE MADE DEATH ITSELF LOOK BEAUTIFUL
THE LOCALITY WAS WELLINGTON SUMNER COUNTY KANSAS IN THE MEANTIME OLD QUEEN WAS HAVING A HIGH OLD TIME UP AHEAD SOME HUNDRED FEET BY THEN RUNNING UP THE BANK AND BACK DOWN IN THE DRAW
DO THOU THEREFORE O RHADAMANTHUS WHO SITTEST IN JUDGMENT WITH ME IN THE MURKY CAVERNS OF DIS AS THOU KNOWEST ALL THAT THE INSCRUTABLE FATES HAVE DECREED TOUCHING THE RESUSCITATION OF THIS DAMSEL
IT MEANS PEACE SAID PETRUCHIO AND LOVE AND QUIET LIFE WELL SAID BAPTISTA YOU HAVE WON THE WAGER AND I WILL ADD ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND CROWNS TO HER DOWRY ANOTHER DOWRY FOR ANOTHER DAUGHTER FOR SHE IS AS CHANGED AS IF SHE WERE SOMEONE ELSE
BEFRIENDED HIM AND HELPED HIM I KNOW AND UNDERSTAND WHAT A SPICE THAT WOULD ADD TO THE PLEASURE OF DECEIVING ME IF IT REALLY WERE TRUE YES IF IT WERE TRUE BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO AND CAN'T BELIEVE IT
YOU AND ALL THE WORLD WOULD TALK AMISS OF HER YOU SHOULD SEE HOW KIND SHE IS TO ME WHEN WE ARE ALONE IN SHORT I WILL GO OFF TO VENICE TO BUY FINE THINGS FOR OUR WEDDING FOR KISS ME KATE WE WILL BE MARRIED ON SUNDAY WITH THAT
WAS ABLE TO CLOSELY FOLLOW THE COURSE OF THAT LITTLE LECTURE NOTING EACH STRONG POINT MADE BY THE PROFESSOR IN BOLSTERING UP HIS DELIGHTFUL THEORY
MOMENT I DID NOT TELL YOU THE WHOLE TRUTH I THINK THERE IS NO SUFFICIENT GROUND FOR THIS AFFAIR OR FOR BLOOD TO BE SHED OVER IT YOU WERE NOT RIGHT NOT QUITE IN THE RIGHT YOU WERE IMPETUOUS OH YES IT IS HORRIBLY STUPID SAID PIERRE
PIERRE WENT HOME BUT ROSTOV WITH DOLOKHOV AND DENISOV STAYED ON AT THE CLUB TILL LATE LISTENING TO THE GYPSIES AND OTHER SINGERS WELL THEN TILL TOMORROW AT SOKOLNIKI
WHISPERED THEIR FRIGHTENED VOICES
GET A HUSTLE ON BOYS THE DAY IS WANING AND WITH SO MUCH TO SEE TO STUDY TO COME I SAY IN SPITE OF HIS INITIAL ATTEMPT TO IMPRESS HIS NEPHEWS WITH A DUE SENSE OF THE HEAVY RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH RESTED UPON THEM
AND TOO EVERYTHING WAS SO DISTINCT AND CLEARLY OUTLINED THAT ONE COULD FAIRLY FEEL THOSE BLESSED BOW ARROWS TICKLING A FELLOW IN THE SHORT RIBS
DOLOKHOV DENISOV AND ROSTOV WERE NOW SITTING OPPOSITE PIERRE AND SEEMED VERY GAY ROSTOV WAS TALKING MERRILY TO HIS TWO FRIENDS ONE OF WHOM WAS A DASHING HUSSAR AND THE OTHER A NOTORIOUS DUELIST AND RAKE
SAID DOLOKHOV AS HE TOOK LEAVE OF ROSTOV IN THE CLUB PORCH AND DO YOU FEEL QUITE CALM ROSTOV ASKED DOLOKHOV PAUSED
SO THEY JOURNEYED ON TO BAPTISTA'S HOUSE AND ARRIVING THERE THEY FOUND ALL FOLKS KEEPING BIANCA'S WEDDING FEAST AND THAT OF ANOTHER NEWLY MARRIED COUPLE HORTENSIO AND HIS WIFE THEY WERE MADE WELCOME AND SAT DOWN TO THE FEAST AND ALL WAS MERRY
ARE WE GOING TO LAND UNCLE PHAETON QUERIED BRUNO TAKING NOTE OF THAT PREOCCUPATION WHICH MIGHT EASILY PROVE DANGEROUS UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT QUESTION SERVED TO RECALL THE PROFESSOR TO MORE MATERIAL POINTS
TO ALL SEEMING THE HUMAN FOOT HAD NEVER VENTURED HERE NOR WERE ANY MARKS OR SPOOR OF WILD BEASTS PERCEPTIBLE ON EITHER SIDE ALTHOUGH THE AEROSTAT HAD LANDED NOT FAR BELOW THE CREST OF THOSE HILLS
AND EVERY NOW AND THEN HE GLANCED IRONICALLY AT PIERRE WHOSE PREOCCUPIED ABSENT MINDED AND MASSIVE FIGURE WAS A VERY NOTICEABLE ONE AT THE DINNER ROSTOV LOOKED INIMICALLY AT PIERRE
OR WATCHING FOR THE MONSTER BIRD OF PREY RATHER SUGGESTED THE ELDER GILLESPIE OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DISTINGUISH OUR FACES AND OUR BODIES WERE FAIRLY WELL HIDDEN AND EVEN MORE OF COURSE THEY MUST BE TOTALLY IGNORANT OF ALL SUCH THINGS AS FLYING MACHINES AND THE LIKE
SO THAT KATE MIGHT SEE HOW UNBEAUTIFUL A THING ILL TEMPER WAS THE NEXT DAY TOO KATHARINE'S FOOD WAS ALL FOUND FAULT WITH AND CAUGHT AWAY BEFORE SHE COULD TOUCH A MOUTHFUL AND SHE WAS SICK AND GIDDY FOR WANT OF SLEEP
WAS THERE ANYTHING SO VERY ABSURD IN HIS METHOD OF REASONING OR OF DRAWING A DEDUCTION STILL THAT EXALTATION DID NOT PREVENT UNCLE PHAETON FROM TAKING ALL ESSENTIAL PRECAUTIONS AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN AN ESPECIALLY SECURE LANDING PLACE WAS SIGHTED
WHOM HE HAD SLAIN IN SELF DEFENCE CERTAINLY HAD ITS WEIGHT WHILE THE BRIEF AND IMPERFECT GLIMPSE WHICH HE HAD WON OF YONDER VALLEY HELPED TO BEAR OUT THAT ASTOUNDING BELIEF AND YET HOW COULD IT BE TRUE
DO WHAT YOU CAN YOURS WILL NOT BE ENTREATED BUT NOW THE SERVANT CAME IN AND SAID SHE SAYS YOU ARE PLAYING SOME JEST SHE WILL NOT COME BETTER AND BETTER CRIED PETRUCHIO NOW
BUT THEN HE RALLIED FORCING A LAUGH BEFORE SPEAKING NO NO BRUNO
STILL THE INTERVENING DISTANCE WAS NOT SO GREAT AS TO ENTIRELY DEBAR THE BROTHERS FROM FINDING NO LITTLE TO INTEREST THEM AS WAS READILY PROVEN BY THEIR VARIOUS EXCLAMATIONS
IT WAS A WELL SCREENED LOCATION WHERE NAUGHT COULD BE SEEN OF THE FLYING MACHINE UNTIL CLOSE AT HAND YET SO ARRANGED AS TO MAKE A HASTY FLIGHT A VERY EASY MATTER SHOULD THE OCCASION EVER ARISE
THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM THAT TORMENTED HIM WAS CAUSED BY HINTS GIVEN BY THE PRINCESS HIS COUSIN AT MOSCOW CONCERNING DOLOKHOV'S INTIMACY WITH HIS WIFE AND BY AN ANONYMOUS LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED THAT MORNING
THE VALLEY ITSELF SEEMED COMPOSED OF FERTILE SOIL YET BY AID OF THE RIVER WHICH CUT THROUGH NEAR ITS CENTRE IRRIGATING DITCHES CONVEYED WATER TO EVERY ACRE THUS ENSURING BOUNTEOUS CROPS OF GRAIN AND OF FRUIT AS WELL
WHILE WE'LL FORM
YET THE GAZE OF PHAETON FEATHERWIT AS A RULE KEPT TURNED TOWARDS THAT PARTICULAR POINT HIS EYES ON FIRE HIS LIPS TWITCHING HIS WHOLE DEMEANOUR THAT OF ONE WHO FEELS A DISCOVERY OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE LIES JUST BEFORE HIM
BUT THE SERVANT WHO WAS IN HIS MASTER'S SECRET SAID HE FEARED IT WAS NOT GOOD FOR HASTY TEMPERED PEOPLE WOULD SHE LIKE TRIPE
MORE AT THAT HALF SHEEPISH EXPRESSION THAN AT THE QUERY ITSELF BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS GALORE I EXPECT KID BUT YOU NEEDN'T BORROW TROUBLE ON EITHER SCORE YOU CAN OUTRUN THE LADS WHILE AS FOR THE FAIRER SEX
I HOPE BETTER PETRUCHIO ANSWERED THEN HORTENSIO SAID GO AND ENTREAT MY WIFE TO COME TO ME AT ONCE OH IF YOU ENTREAT HER SAID PETRUCHIO I AM AFRAID ANSWERED HORTENSIO SHARPLY
TO BE NUMBED MY LIMBS BEGAN TO FEEL HELPLESS AND MY THOUGHTS MOVED SLUGGISHLY
WHEN SO YOUNG AND FULL OF HEALTH AND STRENGTH EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN AMIDST THE ROAR AND TURMOIL OF THE STORM IT WOULD NOT HAVE SEEMED SO BAD OR WHEN THE GREAT FLOOD WAVE CAME DOWN BUT NOW
WHILE RESUMING WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FAVOURITE MEANS OF WARRING UPON HIS ENEMIES JIMMY COMMENCED HURLING MASSES OF STONE AT THE COMING FOES CHECKED AS THEY WERE THOUGH IT WAS ONLY FOR A
AND THEN I JOINED THE DOCTOR IN SEARCHING
HE WENT TO THE EDGE OF THE SHELF AND DIPPED ONE FOOT IN THE WATER THEN THE OTHER
WITH HIS LIPS TO MY EAR THE STORM HIGH UP THE MOUNTAINS FLOOD THE GORGE JUST THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER CRASHING PEAL OF THUNDER CLOSE UPON A FLASH OF LIGHTNING AND THE HISSING RAIN CEASED AS IF BY MAGIC
THE NOISE WAS NOT SO GREAT THOUGH NOW THAT WE COULD NOT TALK AND AFTER RECOVERING FROM THE APPALLING SHOCK OF THE NEW DANGER WE HAD TIME TO LOOK AROUND OUR FIRST THOUGHT WAS
WHICH DARTED AND QUIVERED IN THE GORGE AT TIMES SEEMING TO LICK THE WALLS AT OTHERS PLUNGING INTO THE RUSHING SEETHING STREAM INTO WHICH THE RAIN POURED IN VERY CATARACTS DOWN THE ROCKY SIDES
WITH FRESH ASSAILANTS TAKING THE PLACES OF THOSE WHO FELL THE THUNDER PEALED SO THAT THE REPORTS OF OUR PIECES SEEMED FEEBLE MORE LIKE THE CRACK OF A CART WHIP AND THEIR FLASHES WERE AS SPARKS COMPARED WITH THE BLINDING LIGHTNING
HE CAME TO ME AND STOOD RUBBING THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AS IF PUZZLED
OF OUR ENEMIES AND WE GAZED EXCITEDLY DOWN THE GORGE AND THEN AT EACH OTHER JACK PENNY SHUDDERING AND TURNING AWAY HIS HEAD
WAITING FOR THE TIME WHEN WE SHOULD BE SWEPT AWAY IN SPITE OF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT AT MOST IN AN HOUR THE LEDGE WOULD BE COVERED
I SAW THE DOCTOR LOOK UP SADLY BUT ONLY TO LOWER HIS HEAD AGAIN
TO OUR PLACE OF REFUGE AND WHERE A MINUTE BEFORE THERE HAD BEEN A ROCKY SHELF THE PATH ALONG WHICH WE HAD COME
STOPPED SHORT ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY UP THE NARROW SLOPE THAT LED TO OUR LITTLE FORT AND THEN WITH A SHRIEK OF DISMAY TURNED AND BEGAN TO RETREAT I STARED AFTER THEM
ABOUT OUR STORES JIMMY GRINNED AND HELPED READILY TO PLACE THE VARIOUS ARTICLES LIKELY TO BE DAMAGED BY
THAT'S RIGHT HE SAID I SHALL DO THE SAME WE MIGHT REACH SOME LEDGE LOWER DOWN HE SAID THAT WORD MIGHT WITH A SLOW
WHILE JACK PENNY STARED AND DREW HIS KNEES UP TO HIS CHIN EMBRACING HIS LEGS
AND DASHED ALONG AT FRIGHTFUL SPEED WE HAD ONLY ESCAPED A SIMILAR FATE THROUGH BEING ON THE SUMMIT SO TO SPEAK OF THE ROCKY PATH
AFTER A CONTEMPTUOUS LOOK AT THE BLACKS WHO WERE CALMLY AWAITING THEIR FATE
READY AT ANY MOMENT FOR A SWIM THE DOCTOR LOOKED UP NOW
THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL WHO MADE
WHO AFTER A TIME CAME UNWILLINGLY FROM THEIR LOWER POSITION SPLASHING MOURNFULLY THROUGH THE WATER BUT EVIDENTLY UNWILLING EVEN THEN TO DISOBEY THEIR WHITE LEADER THEY GROUPED THEMSELVES
READY EAT HALF SHEEP AND DAMPER GIVE JIMMY SOME EAT
BUT I CAN SEE NONE UNLESS THE WATER SINKS WE ARE LOST JOE MY LAD YOU MUST ACT LIKE A MAN I'LL TRY DOCTOR I SAID IN A CHOKING VOICE AND AS I SPOKE
BUT A SIGHT OF THE CALM RESIGNATION OF MY COMPANIONS DAMPED ME AGAIN TILL JIMMY ONCE MORE SPOKE MASS JOE TAKE OFF CLOSUMS PUT LONG GUN UP IN CORNER COME AND FETCH UM
THAT THEY SHOULD GIVE WAY JUST AT A TIME WHEN A BOLD ATTACK WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ENDED IN OUR DESTRUCTION BUT I COULD MAKE OUT NOTHING
FIRST HE PULLED OFF HIS BOOTS THEN HIS STOCKINGS WHICH HE TUCKED METHODICALLY ALONG WITH HIS GARTERS INSIDE HIS BOOTS THIS DONE HE TOOK OFF HIS JACKET FOLDED IT CAREFULLY AND HIS SHIRT FOLLOWED
IN ONE OF WHICH SAT MY MOTHER WAITING FOR TIDINGS OF HER HUSBAND AND SON I COULD NOT HELP IT BUT CLASPED MY HANDS TOGETHER UTTERING A DESPAIRING CRY FOR IT SEEMED SO HARD TO GIVE UP HOPE
WAS TAKEN OFF POUND BY POUND AND BEFORE WE COULD REALISE THE TRUTH THE WATER WAS AT MY KNEES TEN MINUTES LATER IT WAS AT MY FEET AND BEFORE HALF AN HOUR HAD PASSED
CRACKS AND POINTS OF ROCK THAT WE HAD BEFORE NOTICED DISAPPEARING ENTIRELY TILL THE FLOWING EARTH STAINED SURFACE WAS BUT A FEW INCHES BELOW THE LEDGE
WHERE WE WILL PLACE THE AMMUNITION LET'S KEEP THAT DRY IF WE CAN IT MAY NOT BE TOUCHED BY THE WATER EVEN IF WE HAVE TO SWIM FOR OUR LIVES THE GUNS WON'T HURT THAT IS IF THEY ARE NOT WASHED AWAY
AS THE RIVER ROSE WHEN THE BLACK CAME TO ME AND TOUCHED MY SHOULDER
NO WATER GO DOWN HE SAID MASS JOE MASS JACK DOCTOR
GET MUCH TOO MUCH WATER MASS JOE HE SAID WHAT UM GOING TO DO I SHOOK MY HEAD SADLY
THE SCOURING OF THE ROCKS MUST HAVE BEEN INCESSANT THEN MY THOUGHTS CAME BACK TO OUR HORRIBLE POSITION
THAT WHEN THE FINAL STRUGGLE WAS AT HAND WE SHOULD BE SO CLASPED TOGETHER THAT SWIMMING WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AND WE MUST ALL BE DROWNED AND NOW ONCE MORE WITH THE WATER RISING STEADILY
OUR HEAVY CARPENTER'S BENCH HAD TO BE BROUGHT FROM THE BARN AND CARRIED DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN FUCHS SELECTED BOARDS FROM A PILE OF PLANKS GRANDFATHER HAD HAULED OUT FROM TOWN IN THE FALL TO MAKE A NEW FLOOR FOR THE OATS BIN WHEN AT LAST THE LUMBER AND TOOLS WERE ASSEMBLED
THEY WERE ALL EAGER FOR ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE SUICIDE AND THEY WERE GREATLY CONCERNED AS TO WHERE MISTER SHIMERDA WOULD BE BURIED THE NEAREST CATHOLIC CEMETERY WAS AT BLACK HAWK
GRANDFATHER HEARD OUR STORY WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE HE ADVISED JAKE TO RIDE TO TOWN TO MORROW
THE ONE IDEA THAT HAD EVER GOT THROUGH POOR MAREK'S THICK HEAD WAS THAT ALL EXERTION WAS MERITORIOUS HE ALWAYS BORE DOWN ON THE HANDLES OF THE CULTIVATOR AND DROVE THE BLADES SO DEEP INTO THE EARTH THAT THE HORSES WERE SOON EXHAUSTED
THERE I WILL BURY HIM IF I DIG THE GRAVE MYSELF SHE SAY I HAVE TO PROMISE HER I HELP AMBROSCH MAKE THE GRAVE TO MORROW GRANDFATHER SMOOTHED HIS BEARD AND LOOKED JUDICIAL
HE SAY I BREAK HIS SAW WHEN WE BUILD AND I NEVER GRUMBLED AMBROSCH I KNEW HE HAD BROKEN THE SAW AND THEN HID IT AND LIED ABOUT IT I BEGAN TO WISH I HAD NOT STAYED FOR SUPPER EVERYTHING WAS DISAGREEABLE TO ME
GOOD MORNING MISSUS SHIMERDA CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I WILL FIND AMBROSCH WHICH FIELD HE WITH THE SOD CORN SHE POINTED TOWARD THE NORTH STILL STANDING IN FRONT OF THE COW AS IF SHE HOPED TO CONCEAL IT
THEY DID NOT TAKE THE PATH AROUND THE POND BUT PLUNGED THROUGH THE MUDDY WATER WITHOUT EVEN LIFTING THEIR SKIRTS THEY CAME ON SCREAMING AND CLAWING THE AIR
I'LL GET RIGHT AFTER JOSIAH TO START ONE IN THE SPRING IF ANYTHING WAS TO HAPPEN TO ME I DON'T WANT THE NORWEGIANS HOLDING INQUISITIONS OVER ME TO SEE WHETHER I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO BE LAID AMONGST EM SOON GRANDFATHER RETURNED BRINGING WITH HIM ANTON JELINEK AND THAT IMPORTANT PERSON THE CORONER
AMBROSCH SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAUNTERED DOWN THE HILL TOWARD THE STABLE I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS ONE OF HIS MEAN DAYS PRESENTLY HE RETURNED CARRYING A COLLAR THAT HAD BEEN BADLY USED TRAMPLED IN THE DIRT AND GNAWED BY RATS UNTIL THE HAIR WAS STICKING OUT OF IT
AMBROSCH'S FEET HAD SCARCELY TOUCHED THE GROUND WHEN HE LUNGED OUT WITH A VICIOUS KICK AT JAKE'S STOMACH FORTUNATELY JAKE WAS IN SUCH A POSITION THAT HE COULD DODGE IT THIS WAS NOT THE SORT OF THING COUNTRY BOYS DID WHEN THEY PLAYED AT FISTICUFFS AND JAKE WAS FURIOUS
OUR NEIGHBORS BURNED OFF THEIR PASTURE BEFORE THE NEW GRASS MADE A START SO THAT THE FRESH GROWTH WOULD NOT BE MIXED WITH THE DEAD STAND OF LAST YEAR THOSE LIGHT SWIFT FIRES RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SEEMED A PART OF THE SAME KINDLING THAT WAS IN THE AIR
HIS SOD CORN WILL BE GOOD FOR FODDER THIS WINTER SAID GRANDFATHER ENCOURAGINGLY AND WHERE IS ANTONIA SHE GO WITH MISSUS SHIMERDA KEPT WIGGLING HER BARE FEET ABOUT NERVOUSLY IN THE DUST VERY WELL I WILL RIDE UP THERE
AND JAKE AND OTTO WERE OFTEN SO TIRED AFTER SUPPER THAT I USED TO FEEL AS IF I WERE SURROUNDED BY A WALL OF SILENCE NOW EVERY ONE SEEMED EAGER TO TALK THAT AFTERNOON FUCHS TOLD ME STORY AFTER STORY ABOUT THE BLACK TIGER MINE
I THINK EMMALINE HE CONCLUDED I WILL ASK ANTONIA TO COME OVER AND HELP YOU IN THE KITCHEN SHE WILL BE GLAD TO EARN SOMETHING AND IT WILL BE A GOOD TIME TO END MISUNDERSTANDINGS I MAY AS WELL RIDE OVER THIS MORNING AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
SHE SEEMED TO THINK THAT MY ELDERS WITHHELD HELPFUL INFORMATION AND THAT FROM ME SHE MIGHT GET VALUABLE SECRETS ON THIS OCCASION SHE ASKED ME VERY CRAFTILY WHEN GRANDFATHER EXPECTED TO BEGIN PLANTING CORN
TWO SWEDES HAD FELL OUT OF THAT BUCKET ONCE AND HIT THE WATER FEET DOWN
WHEN SPRING CAME AFTER THAT HARD WINTER ONE COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE NIMBLE AIR EVERY MORNING I WAKENED WITH A FRESH CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WINTER WAS OVER THERE WERE NONE OF THE SIGNS OF SPRING FOR WHICH I USED TO WATCH IN VIRGINIA NO BUDDING WOODS OR BLOOMING GARDENS
AT DINNER GRANDFATHER TALKED TO JELINEK MORE THAN HE USUALLY DID TO STRANGERS WILL THEY BE MUCH DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET A PRIEST HE ASKED JELINEK LOOKED SERIOUS
WHEN I RODE UP TO THE SHIMERDAS ONE BRIGHT WINDY AFTERNOON IN APRIL YULKA RAN OUT TO MEET ME IT WAS TO HER NOW THAT I GAVE READING LESSONS ANTONIA WAS BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS
ONE MORNING HE TOLD US THAT THE SMALL GRAIN WAS COMING ON SO WELL HE THOUGHT HE WOULD BEGIN TO CUT HIS WHEAT ON THE FIRST OF JULY HE WOULD NEED MORE MEN AND IF IT WERE AGREEABLE TO EVERY ONE HE WOULD ENGAGE AMBROSCH FOR THE REAPING AND THRASHING AS THE SHIMERDAS HAD NO SMALL GRAIN OF THEIR OWN
MISSUS SHIMERDA DROPPED THE ROPE RAN AFTER US AND CROUCHING DOWN BESIDE GRANDFATHER SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND KISSED IT I DOUBT IF HE HAD EVER BEEN SO MUCH EMBARRASSED BEFORE I WAS A LITTLE STARTLED TOO SOMEHOW THAT SEEMED TO BRING THE OLD WORLD VERY CLOSE
AND THE DRY I DID NOT ANSWER HER WHAT WAS THE USE AS I SAT WAITING FOR THE HOUR WHEN AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA WOULD RETURN FROM THE FIELDS I WATCHED MISSUS SHIMERDA AT HER WORK SHE TOOK FROM THE OVEN A COFFEE CAKE WHICH SHE WANTED TO KEEP WARM FOR SUPPER
I WANT WE HAVE VERY MUCH CORN THIS FALL WHILE THE HORSES DREW IN THE WATER AND NOSED EACH OTHER AND THEN DRANK AGAIN ANTONIA SAT DOWN ON THE WINDMILL STEP AND RESTED HER HEAD ON HER HAND YOU SEE THE BIG PRAIRIE FIRE FROM YOUR PLACE LAST NIGHT
ALL DAY LONG OUR PRIEST GO ABOUT THERE TO GIVE THE SACRAMENT TO DYING MEN AND I GO WITH HIM TO CARRY THE VESSELS WITH THE HOLY SACRAMENT EVERYBODY THAT GO NEAR THAT CAMP CATCH THE SICKNESS BUT ME AND THE PRIEST BUT WE HAVE NO SICKNESS WE HAVE NO FEAR
THE WIND BLEW ABOUT US IN WARM SWEET GUSTS WE RODE SLOWLY WITH A PLEASANT SENSE OF SUNDAY INDOLENCE WE FOUND THE SHIMERDAS WORKING JUST AS IF IT WERE A WEEK DAY MAREK WAS CLEANING OUT THE STABLE AND ANTONIA AND HER MOTHER WERE MAKING GARDEN
GRANDMOTHER SAID YES M FUCHS ADMITTED WITH MODEST PRIDE SO FEW FOLKS DOES KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GOOD TIGHT BOX THAT'LL TURN WATER I SOMETIMES WONDER IF THERE'LL BE ANYBODY ABOUT TO DO IT FOR ME
I TOLD HER ADDING THAT HE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A DRY SPRING AND THAT THE CORN WOULD NOT BE HELD BACK BY TOO MUCH RAIN AS IT HAD BEEN LAST YEAR SHE GAVE ME A SHREWD GLANCE HE NOT JESUS SHE BLUSTERED HE NOT KNOW ABOUT THE WET
WHY DO YOU NEVER LET ME PUT YOU ON YOUR HORSE SAID HUGH YOU ALWAYS MANAGE TO PREVENT ME SOMEHOW OR OTHER
AND THOUGH LOVE BE GOOD A TEMPEST OF IT IN THE BRAIN WILL NOT RIPEN THE FRUITS LIKE A SOFT STEADY WIND OR WAFT THE SHIPS HOME TO THEIR DESIRED HAVEN PERHAPS WHAT ENSLAVED HUGH MOST WAS THE FEELING THAT THE DAMSEL STOOPED TO HIM
IF YOU WERE TO GO IN THIS LINE EXACTLY YOU WOULD GO THROUGH THE SMOKE AND FIRE OF A BURNING MOUNTAIN IN A LAND OF ICE IF YOU WERE TO GO THIS WAY STRAIGHT ON YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST WITH A LION GLARING AT YOUR FEET
WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT HARRY HUGH FELT A GLOW OF PLEASURE AS THE VOICE FELL ON HIS EAR IT WAS EUPHRA'S OH REPLIED HARRY MISTER SUTHERLAND IS TEACHING ME GEOGRAPHY WITH A TELESCOPE IT'S SUCH FUN
WITHOUT KNOWING THAT SHE STOOPED SHE SEEMED TO HIM IN EVERY WAY ABOVE HIM SHE KNEW SO MANY THINGS OF WHICH HE WAS IGNORANT COULD SAY SUCH LOVELY THINGS COULD HE DID NOT DOUBT WRITE LOVELY VERSES COULD SING LIKE AN ANGEL
OH IT WILL BE NICE CRIED HARRY AFTER A LITTLE MORE GEOGRAPHICAL TALK THEY PUT UP THEIR INSTRUMENTS AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE HILL HARRY WAS IN NO NEED OF HUGH'S BACK NOW BUT EUPHRA WAS IN NEED OF HIS HAND
FOR A SWEET FAULT EUPHRA I BEG YOUR PARDON MISS CAMERON YOU PUNISH ME WITH FORGIVENESS RETURNED SHE WITH ONE OF HER SWEETEST LOOKS HUGH COULD NOT HELP PRESSING THE LITTLE HAND
A FRESH SPRING BEGAN TO BURST FROM THE VERY BOSOM OF WHAT HAD SEEMED BEFORE A PERFECT SUMMER A SPRING TO SUMMER WHAT WOULD THE FOLLOWING SUMMER BE AH AND WHAT THE AUTUMN AND WHAT THE WINTER
AS THE FIRST EFFECTS OF SOME POISONS ARE LIKE A DAWN OF TENFOLD STRENGTH THE MOUNTAIN WIND BLEW FROM HER TO HIM SOMETIMES SWEEPING HER GARMENTS ABOUT HIM AND BATHING HIM IN THEIR FAINT SWEET ODOURS
OH YES OF COURSE VERY WELL WHAT LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL DOWN THERE ARNSTEAD TO BE SURE AND WHAT BEYOND THERE I DON'T KNOW LOOK THROUGH HERE
YES IT WILL IF YOU TURN IT AWAY ALL DAY LONG LOOK HARRY IF YOU WERE TO GO STRAIGHT ON IN THIS DIRECTION YOU WOULD COME TO A LAPLANDER HARNESSING HIS BROAD HORNED REINDEER TO HIS SLEDGE HE'S AT IT NOW I DARESAY
I FEAR I AM NO GENTLEMAN SAID HE LAUGHING BUT I CAN AT LEAST LEARN AS WELL AS TEACH WE SHALL BEGIN TO MORROW WHAT BOOKS HAVE YOU OH NO BOOKS IF YOU PLEASE JUST YET IF YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH HARRY'S PROGRESS SO FAR
DESPISE HIS PRESENT POSITION AND LOOK UPON A TUTOR'S EMPLOYMENT AS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE LOOK UPON IT AS A RATHER CONTEMPTIBLE ONE IN FACT
POOH POOH SAID HE THIS IS MERE CHILD'S PLAY LET ME ASK YOU SOME MISTER SUTHERLAND HIS VERY FIRST QUESTION POSED HUGH WHOSE KNOWLEDGE IN THIS SCIENCE WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS MINUTE
AND ALL THE WORLD LIES ROUND ABOUT IT DO YOU KNOW WE ARE IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE EARTH ARE WE INDEED YES DON'T YOU KNOW ANY POINT YOU LIKE TO CHOOSE ON A BALL IS THE MIDDLE OF IT
A THOROUGH GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE IS ESSENTIAL TO THE EDUCATION OF A GENTLEMAN ASK ME ANY QUESTION YOU PLEASE MISTER SUTHERLAND ON THE MAP OF THE WORLD OR ANY OF ITS DIVISIONS HUGH ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH MISTER ARNOLD ANSWERED AT ONCE
BUT IT SET HIM UPON A VERY UNPROFITABLE KIND OF CASTLE BUILDING HE WOULD BE A SOLDIER LIKE HIS FATHER HE WOULD LEAVE ARNSTEAD TO REVISIT IT WITH A SWORD BY HIS SIDE AND A SIR BEFORE HIS NAME
AH WE MUST APPLY TO YOUR PAPA NOW TO LEND US SOME OF HIS BEAUTIFUL MAPS THEY WILL TEACH US WHAT LIES BEYOND THAT HILL AND THEN WE CAN READ IN SOME OF HIS BOOKS ABOUT THE PLACES AND SO GO ON AND ON TILL WE REACH THE BEAUTIFUL WIDE RESTLESS SEA
WAS THE PRESSURE RETURNED SO SLIGHT SO AIRY WAS THE TOUCH THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONLY THE THROB OF HIS OWN PULSES ALL CONSCIOUSLY VITAL ABOUT THE WONDERFUL WOMAN HAND THAT RESTED IN HIS
PERHAPS THAT MAY BE THE REASON FOR THE DECIDED DISTASTE HE SHOWS FOR IT NOW MISTER ARNOLD BUT I WILL BEGIN TO TEACH HIM AT ONCE IF YOU DESIRE IT I DO DESIRE IT MISTER SUTHERLAND
MEANTIME THIS MUCH IS CERTAIN THAT SHE WAS DRAWING HUGH CLOSER AND CLOSER TO HER SIDE THAT A SOOTHING DREAM OF DELIGHT HAD BEGUN TO STEAL OVER HIS SPIRIT SOON TO MAKE IT TOSS IN FEVEROUS UNREST
SIR HUGH SUTHERLAND WOULD BE SOMEBODY EVEN IN THE EYES OF THE MASTER OF ARNSTEAD YES A SIX FOOT FELLOW THOUGH HE MAY BE SENSIBLE IN THE MAIN IS NOT THEREFORE FREE FROM SMALL VANITIES
AND THERE THERE IS A DESERT OF SAND AND A CAMEL DYING AND ALL HIS COMPANIONS JUST DISAPPEARING ON THE HORIZON AND THERE THERE IS AN AWFUL SEA WITHOUT A BOAT TO BE SEEN ON IT DARK AND DISMAL WITH HUGE ROCKS ALL ABOUT IT
AND WASTE BORDERS OF SAND SO DREADFUL HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS MISTER SUTHERLAND YOU HAVE NEVER WALKED ALONG THOSE LINES I KNOW FOR YOU COULDN'T GEOGRAPHY HAS TAUGHT ME NO MISTER SUTHERLAND SAID HARRY INCREDULOUSLY
IT IS NEARLY AS MUCH A MYSTERY TO ME AS TO YOU WHERE IS THE NORTH POLE LOOK THE LITTLE THING POINTS TO IT BUT I WILL TURN IT AWAY OH IT WON'T GO IT GOES BACK AND BACK DO WHAT I WILL
MISTER SUTHERLAND I BEG YOUR PARDON I CAN MAKE NO EXCUSE FOR EUPHRA FOR SHE HAD POSITIVELY NEVER HEARD HIM CALLED HUGH THERE WAS NO ONE TO DO SO BUT THE SLIP HAD NOT THEREFORE THE LESS EFFECT
WE HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING AT THAT YET MISTER ARNOLD NOT DONE ANYTHING AT GEOGRAPHY AND THE BOY GETTING QUITE ROBUST NOW I AM ASTONISHED MISTER SUTHERLAND WHY WHEN HE WAS A MERE CHILD HE COULD REPEAT ALL THE COUNTIES OF ENGLAND

SICILIA LIES WHOSE HOSPITABLE SHORES IN SAFETY WE MAY REACH WITH STRUGGLING OARS AENEAS THEN REPLIED
NOR STORMS NOR THUNDER EQUAL HALF HIS HASTE THE NEXT BUT THO THE NEXT YET FAR DISJOIN'D CAME SALIUS AND EURYALUS BEHIND THEN HELYMUS
TO SUPPORT HER IN SO LONG A WAY HE SHOWS HER WHERE HIS HIDDEN TREASURE LAY ADMONISH'D THUS AND SEIZ'D WITH MORTAL FRIGHT THE QUEEN PROVIDES COMPANIONS OF HER FLIGHT
KNOW GENTLE YOUTH IN LIBYAN LANDS YOU ARE A PEOPLE RUDE IN PEACE AND ROUGH IN WAR THE RISING CITY WHICH FROM FAR YOU SEE IS CARTHAGE
ONE WHO CONDEMN'D DIVINE AND HUMAN LAWS THEN STRIFE ENSUED
NOW ALL UNITED IN A GOODLY TEAM THEY SKIM THE GROUND AND SEEK THE QUIET STREAM AS THEY WITH JOY RETURNING CLAP THEIR WINGS AND RIDE THE CIRCUIT OF THE SKIES IN RINGS
WHICH WHEN HE FOUND HE POUR'D TO BACCHUS ON THE HALLOW'D GROUND TWO BOWLS OF SPARKLING WINE OF MILK TWO MORE AND TWO FROM OFFER'D BULLS OF PURPLE GORE
CHASING THRO IDA'S GROVES THE TREMBLING HART BREATHLESS HE SEEMS YET EAGER TO PURSUE WHEN FROM ALOFT DESCENDS IN OPEN VIEW THE BIRD OF JOVE
MY FRIENDS AND HECTOR'S FOLLOWERS HERETOFORE EXERT YOUR VIGOR TUG THE LAB'RING OAR STRETCH TO YOUR STROKES MY STILL UNCONQUER'D CREW
HIS OPPOSITE SUSTAIN IN OPEN VIEW STAND FORTH THE CHAMPION AND THE GAMES RENEW
SINCE ON OUR FRIENDLY SHORE YOUR SHIPS ARE DRIV'N HAVE COURAGE TO THE GODS PERMIT THE REST AND TO THE QUEEN EXPOSE YOUR JUST REQUEST
BUT SECRET SHELVES TOO CAUTIOUSLY HE FEAR'D AND FEARING SOUGHT THE DEEP AND STILL ALOOF HE STEER'D WITH LOUDER CRIES THE CAPTAIN CALL'D AGAIN
AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT THE EARTHS SHOULD BE STOPPED BUT THERE WERE AND HAD BEEN VARIOUS OPINIONS ON THIS DIFFICULT POINT AS THE LAWS OF HUNTING ARE COMPLEX RECONDITE NUMEROUS TRADITIONAL AND NOT ALWAYS PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD
AN OLD MAN WITH A BAG IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND LEANING UPON A YOUTH TOTTERED BY THE YOUTH BORE A TORCH GLAUCUS RECOGNIZED THE TWO AS FATHER AND SON MISER AND PRODIGAL FATHER SAID THE YOUTH
BEHOLD THE LORD DESCENDETH TO JUDGMENT HE MAKETH FIRE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IN THE SIGHT OF MEN
UNWITTING OF THE VICINITY LAY THE GIANT FORM OF HIM WHO HAD ACCOSTED THEM THE WOUNDED GLADIATOR
BUT YOU'LL BE AT MATCHING I DO GET A FEW DAYS AT HOME SOMETIMES YOU SEE I HAVE ESCAPED FOR THE PRESENT OR OTHERWISE YOU AND I WOULD NOT HAVE COME TO GRIEF TOGETHER IN BROUGHTON SPINNIES
THERE IS NO HUMAN BEING ALIVE MAJOR TIFTO WHOSE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE COULD BE A MATTER OF MORE INDIFFERENCE TO ME
HE SPENT MANY LONG HOURS AT THE BEARGARDEN THERE'LL VERY SOON BE AN END OF THIS AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED
THIS PUT HIS HAND UPON HIS HEART YOU CAN'T SLEEP IN YOUR BED TILL IT'S OUT I DID THAT THING THAT THEY SAID I DID WHAT THING WHY THE NAIL IT WAS I LAMED THE HORSE
I WISH TO DO NOTHING AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THE MATTER IS OVER IT MADE ME SICK OF HORSES AND I DO NOT WISH TO HAVE TO THINK OF IT AGAIN NEVERTHELESS MY LORD I'VE GOT TO TELL IT IT WAS GREEN WHO PUT ME UP TO IT
YOU TURNED ME OUT THAT IS TRUE MAJOR TIFTO YOU WAS VERY ROUGH THEN WASN'T YOU ROUGH A MAN'S BEDROOM IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE
A SHABBY HAT AND OLD GLOVES DID HE SPEAK TO YOU ASKED SILVERBRIDGE NO NOR I TO HIM
HE WAS TRUE TO ME TILL HE THOUGHT I SNUBBED HIM I WOULD NOT LET HIM GO DOWN TO SILVERBRIDGE WITH ME I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I DROVE THE POOR MAJOR TO HIS MALPRACTICES AT THIS MOMENT DOLLY LONGSTAFF SAUNTERED INTO THE ROOM AND CAME UP TO THEM
HE IS AT MATCHING NOW AND I DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL EVER LEAVE IT AGAIN I SHALL GO THERE FROM HERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND RELIEVE GUARD WITH LADY GLENCORA I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU GET FOR IT ALL GET WHAT SHOULD I GET
BUT I GOT A FEELING ON ME THAT YOU WANTED TO GET RID OF ME AND I ALL THE TIME DOING THE BEST I COULD FOR THE ORSES I DID DO THE BEST I COULD UP TO THAT VERY MORNING AT DONCASTER WELL IT WAS GREEN PUT ME UP TO IT
THAT LIGHTNING HAD REVEALED TO EACH OTHER THE FORM OF BEAST AND MAN YET THE INSTINCT OF BOTH WAS QUELLED NAY THE LION CREPT NEARER AND NEARER TO THE GLADIATOR AS FOR COMPANIONSHIP
IT WAS EVIDENT SHE HAD BEEN SWEPT ALONG SOME OPPOSITE DIRECTION BY THE HUMAN CURRENT THEIR FRIEND THEIR PRESERVER WAS LOST AND HITHERTO NYDIA HAD BEEN THEIR GUIDE
THEY SHALL PUNISH ME AND HIM TOO I'M IN THAT STATE OF MIND THAT ANY CHANGE WOULD BE FOR THE BETTER BUT HE HE OUGHT TO HAVE IT HEAVY IT WON'T BE DONE BY ME MAJOR TIFTO
WILL NEVER RECEIVE A TITHE OF THE RESPECT THAT HAS BEEN PAID TO THIS OLD FAINEANT BUT HE WILL ACHIEVE MUCH MORE THAN TEN TIMES THE REPUTATION SAID PHINEAS I WON'T COMPARE THEM NOR WILL I ARGUE BUT I LIKE THE DUKE
I GOT TO THINK THAT YOUR LORDSHIP WAS UPSETTING I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR LORDSHIP REMEMBERS BUT YOU DID PUT ME DOWN ONCE OR TWICE RATHER UNCOMMON I HOPE I WAS NOT UNJUST I DON'T SAY YOU WAS MY LORD
SAVE THE PRIMAL LAW OF SELF PRESERVATION THROUGH THIS AWFUL SCENE DID THE ATHENIAN WADE HIS WAY ACCOMPANIED BY IONE AND THE BLIND GIRL SUDDENLY A RUSH OF HUNDREDS IN THEIR PATH TO THE SEA SWEPT BY THEM
NYDIA WAS TORN FROM THE SIDE OF GLAUCUS WHO WITH IONE WAS BORNE RAPIDLY ONWARD AND WHEN THE CROWD WHOSE FORMS THEY SAW NOT SO THICK WAS THE GLOOM WERE GONE NYDIA WAS STILL SEPARATED FROM THEIR SIDE
AND THE GLADIATOR DID NOT RECEDE OR TREMBLE THE REVOLUTION OF NATURE HAD DISSOLVED HER LIGHTER TERRORS AS WELL AS HER WONTED TIES WHILE THEY WERE THUS TERRIBLY PROTECTED
IF YOU CANNOT MOVE MORE SWIFTLY I MUST LEAVE YOU OR WE BOTH PERISH FLY BOY THEN AND LEAVE THY SIRE BUT I CANNOT FLY TO STARVE GIVE ME THY BAG OF GOLD AND THE YOUTH SNATCHED AT IT
AND TO BE RETURNING AFTER AN EXCELLENT DAY'S WORK THEN MADAME GOESLER BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HERSELF AND TO GIVE A SHORT HISTORY OF HER LIFE DURING THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS SHE DID THIS IN A FRANK NATURAL MANNER
I CAME THEN TO CONFESS IT ALL BEFORE IT WAS DONE THEN WHY COULDN'T YOU LET THE HORSE ALONE I WAS IN THEIR HANDS AND THEN YOU WAS SO ROUGH WITH ME SO I SAID TO MYSELF I MIGHT AS WELL DO IT
WE WAS VERY MUCH TOGETHER AT ONE TIME MY LORD YES MAJOR TIFTO WE WERE OF COURSE I WAS A VILLAIN BUT IT WAS ONLY ONCE AND YOUR LORDSHIP WAS SO ROUGH TO ME I AM NOT SAYING BUT WHAT I WAS A VILLAIN
GLAUCUS SHOUTED HER NAME NO ANSWER CAME THEY RETRACED THEIR STEPS IN VAIN THEY COULD NOT DISCOVER HER
AND A SUBLIME AND UNEARTHLY EMOTION HAD NOT INDEED QUELLED THEIR AWE BUT IT HAD ROBBED AWE OF FEAR THEY HAD LONG BELIEVED ACCORDING TO THE ERROR OF THE EARLY CHRISTIANS THAT THE LAST DAY WAS AT HAND
MISTER GOWRAN THOUGHT THAT HE KNEW A GENTLEMAN WHEN HE SAW ONE HE THOUGHT ALSO THAT HE KNEW A LADY AND THAT HE DIDN'T SEE ONE WHEN HE WAS ENGAGED WITH HIS MISTRESS COUSIN INDEED
I SUPPOSE I'M A KIND OF UNCLE AND BROTHER IN ONE
BRILLIANT IS THE WORD WHICH BEST DESCRIBES YOU UNCLE JULIUS HAD THE UPPER PART OF HIS PONDEROUS FIGURE ARRAYED IN A FROCK COAT HE DID NOT TAKE KINDLY TO WHAT HE TERMED THOSE SKITTISH SPARROW TAILED AFFAIRS FROCK COATS SUITED HIM BUT I AM NOT PARTIAL TO THEM ON EVERY ONE
I DON'T CARE ONE STRAW FOR MISTER CAMPERDOWN JUST LET ME FINISH OH CERTAINLY AND YOU MUSTN'T BE ANGRY WITH ME FRANK THE MATTER IS SO MUCH TO ME ISN'T IT I WON'T BE ANGRY
ALSO I WAS TO BE FAVOURED WITH A LOOK AT MY REFLECTION IN A MIRROR FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MY ARRIVAL
AND PUT THEM IN A BOWL BESIDE MY BED
HOWEVER TONIGHT I MADE AN EFFORT IN MY OLD FAVOURITE THREE FISHERS WENT SAILING THE BEAUTY OF THE FULL TONED RONISCH PIANO AND EVERARD'S CLEVER AND SYMPATHETIC ACCOMPANYING CAUSED ME TO FORGET MY AUDIENCE AND SING AS THOUGH TO MYSELF ALONE
GAMMON THAT'S WHAT MAKES MY KISSES SO NICE HE ANSWERED AND AFTER HOLDING ME AT ARM'S LENGTH FOR INSPECTION BY GEORGE YOU'RE A WONDERFUL LOOKING GIRL YOU'RE SURELY NOT DONE GROWING YET THOUGH YOU ARE SUCH A LITTLE NIPPER I COULD PUT YOU IN MY POCKET WITH EASE
ALL THE WORLD HAS BEEN TOLD OF THE ENGAGEMENT THERE MUST BE SOME PUNISHMENT
BUT YOU ARE WILD AND WAYWARD
I DON'T CLEARLY KNOW WHAT A GILLIE IS HE SAID IN ANSWER TO ONE OF FRANK'S EXPLANATIONS IF A GILLIE MEANS A LAD WITHOUT ANY BREECHES ON I DON'T MIND
AND HERRIOT HAD COME GREYSTOCK BROUGHT WITH HIM TWO GUNS TWO FISHING RODS A MAN SERVANT
AND HER MOTHER HAD INDUCED HER TO SUE FOR A JUDICIAL SEPARATION WHICH WAS EASILY OBTAINED WHEN A WOMAN IS SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND IT IS THE RELIGION OF THE WORLD AT LARGE TO CAST THE WHOLE BLAME ON THE WIFE
I THINK THAT HIS CONDUCT IS INEXCUSABLE AND THERE IS TO BE NO PUNISHMENT SHE ASKED WITH THAT STRONG INDIGNATION AT INJUSTICE WHICH THE UNJUST ALWAYS FEEL WHEN THEY ARE INJURED
ELSE YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN A PERSON WITH THE EMPTIEST OF CHARACTERS
I THINK LORD FAWN IS BEHAVING VERY BADLY AND I HAVE TOLD HIM SO NO DOUBT HE IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OTHERS MOTHER AND SISTERS WHO ARE NOT FRIENDLY TO YOU FALSE FACED IDIOTS SAID LIZZIE HE HIMSELF IS SOMEWHAT AFRAID OF ME IS MUCH AFRAID OF YOU
FOR HER LIFE AT LEAST IT WAS ALL HERS AND AFTER HER DEATH WOULD BELONG TO HER SON WHAT MORE DOES ANY HUMAN BEING DESIRE OF SUCH A PROPERTY THAN THAT HE RODE DOWN TO THE GREAT DOORWAY THE MOUNTAIN TRACK WHICH FELL ON TO THE ROAD ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE CASTLE HAVING BEEN PLAIN ENOUGH
HAVING LEFT LONDON OVER NIGHT BY THE LIMITED MAIL TRAIN THE PONY AT ONCE PRESENTED ITSELF TO THEM IT WAS A LITTLE SHAGGY BLACK BEAST WITH A BOY ALMOST AS SHAGGY AS ITSELF BUT THEY WERE BOTH GOOD OF THEIR KIND OH YOU'RE THE LADDIE WITH THE POWNIE ARE YOU SAID FRANK
AND BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT HELD OUT HIS HAND AND TOOK ME WITH HIM THE REGRET OF IT ALL WAS I COULD NEVER MEET THEM BYRON THACKERAY DICKENS LONGFELLOW GORDON KENDALL THE MEN I LOVED ALL WERE DEAD
NO DOUBT HE IS FAR MORE CALCULATING AND ARTFUL THAN I THOUGHT HE WAS CAPABLE OF BEING
AS SHE COULD NOT RUSH INTO HIS ARMS
MY PALE BLUE CASHMERE DRESS FITTED MY FULLY DEVELOPED YET GIRLISH FIGURE TO PERFECTION
UNCLE JULIUS SAID AND AUNTIE HELEN CAME TO FINISH MY TOILET WHILE THEY WERE MAKING THEIRS THERE NOW YOU HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF IN THE WAY OF LOOKS SHE REMARKED AT THE COMPLETION OF THE CEREMONY
THE SOUND OF CAMP BELLS AND JINGLE OF HOBBLE CHAINS FLOATING ON THE SOFT TWILIGHT BREEZES HAD COME TO THESE MEN
UNCLE JAY JAY WAITED TO HEAR NO MORE BUT CARRYING ME TO THE MUSIC STOOL AND DEPOSITING ME THEREON WARNED ME NOT TO ATTEMPT TO LEAVE IT BEFORE SINGING SOMETHING
NOW SHE WAS MAKING SOME FOR ME WHICH HOWEVER I WAS NOT TO SEE UNTIL I WORE THEM AUNT HELEN HAD THIS AS A PLEASANT SURPRISE
LOVE HIM I HATE HIM I ALWAYS DESPISED HIM AND NOW I HATE HIM AND YET YOU WOULD MARRY HIM NOT FOR WORLDS FRANK NO BECAUSE YOU ADVISED ME I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD DO SO YES YOU DID FRANK
THEN HE STARTED AND HERRIOT AT ONCE WENT TO WORK ON STONE AND TODDY WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH HE HAD TRAVELLED ALL NIGHT
AND JUMPED UP LOOKING FIT TO EAT ME I ACTED SEVERAL MORE IMPROMPTU SCENES WITH THE OTHER OCCUPANTS OF THE DRAWING ROOM MISTER HAWDEN EMITTED HUMPH FROM THE CORNER WHERE HE GRUMPILY SAT BUT MISTER GREY WAS FULL OF PRAISE SPLENDID SPLENDID HE EXCLAIMED
TILL SIR FLORIAN HAD SETTLED THAT ACCOUNT FOR HER
AND BECOMING ENAMOURED OF ANOTHER WOMAN HE TRIED TO OBTAIN A DIVORCE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS WIFE'S SPOTLESS CHARACTER HE WAS UNABLE TO DO THIS HE THEREFORE DESERTED HER AND OPENLY LIVED WITH THE OTHER WOMAN AS HIS MISTRESS THIS FORCED AUNT HELEN TO RETURN TO CADDAGAT
OH EVER SO WICKED MISTER GOWRAN WHO WAS A STERN MORALIST WAS CERTAINLY DISAPPOINTED AT FRANK'S APPEARANCE
DIGEST OF THE COMMON LAW THE BEST OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION CONSISTS IN THIS
WHEN DRESSED CARELESSLY AND WITH MY HAIR PLASTERED IN A TIGHT COIL PEOPLE NOT KNOWING ME WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS UNDER TWENTY JOY AND MERRIMENT LIT UP MY FACE WHICH GLOWED WITH YOUTH HEALTH AND HAPPINESS
UNCLE JAY JAY WAS LAUGHING LIKE FUN EVEN AUNT HELEN DEIGNED TO SMILE AND EVERARD WAS LOOKING ON WITH CRITICAL INTEREST GO ON SAID UNCLE BUT MISTER HAWDEN GOT HUFFY AT THE RIDICULE WHICH HE SUSPECTED I WAS CALLING DOWN UPON HIM
AND SING AND SING TILL I MADE THE ECHOES RING WAS ONE OF THE CHIEF JOYS OF MY EXISTENCE BUT I HAD NEVER MADE A SUCCESS IN SINGING TO COMPANY BESIDES LOSING ALL NERVE I HAD A VERY QUEER VOICE
AND AS SHE SPOKE ALL HER LITTLE FEMININE SOFTNESSES WERE FOR THE MOMENT LAID ASIDE IF MISTER DOVE'S OPINION BE IN YOUR FAVOUR WELL SAID LIZZIE WHAT THEN IN THAT CASE MISTER CAMPERDOWN ACTING ON BEHALF OF JOHN EUSTACE AND YOUNG FLORIAN
BY REASON OF HER YOUTH AND PURITY MISSUS BELL HAD NOT AS MUCH TO SUFFER IN THIS WAY AS SOME OTHERS BUT COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING HER LIFE WAS WRECKED SHE HAD BEEN HUMILIATED AND OUTRAGED IN THE CRUELLEST WAY BY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVED AND TRUSTED
THERE WAS SOMETHING BEAUTIFULLY SINCERE AND REAL ABOUT AUNT HELEN SHE NEVER FUSSED OVER ANY ONE OR PRETENDED TO SYMPATHIZE JUST TO MAKE OUT HOW NICE SHE WAS SHE WAS REAL AND YOU FELT THAT NO MATTER WHAT WILD OR AWFUL RUBBISH YOU TALKED TO HER
WE DIDN'T FEEL SO BRASH AS WHAT WE DID BEFORE IT WAS HURTING HIM CONSIDERABLE AND BLEEDING SO WE LAID HIM IN THE WIGWAM
NOR SIGHT NOR SOUND OF THEM
WITH CLENCHED TEETH THE WARDEN PULLED THE POLICE ALARM AND THAT WIRE WAS CUT TOO THE STRANGER EXPLAINED THE WARDEN CAME TO HIS FEET WITH WHITE FACE AND NAILS BITING INTO THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS
ANY RESISTANCE WOULD BE BUT WHO
BUT IT DIDN'T DO NO GOOD SO WHEN HE SEES ME GETTING THE CANOE READY HE SAYS
THEN WE STRUCK OUT EASY AND COMFORTABLE FOR THE ISLAND WHERE MY RAFT WAS AND WE COULD HEAR THEM YELLING AND BARKING AT EACH OTHER ALL UP AND DOWN THE BANK
WHO'S THAT ANSWER OR I'LL SHOOT BUT WE DIDN'T ANSWER WE JUST UNFURLED OUR HEELS AND SHOVED THEN THERE WAS A RUSH AND A
AND PRETTY SOON JUMPS UP AND SAYS WHY LAWSAMERCY IT'S MOST NIGHT AND SID NOT COME YET WHAT HAS BECOME OF THAT BOY I SEE MY CHANCE SO I SKIPS UP AND SAYS
HE WARN'T THERE SO THE OLD MAN HE GOT A LETTER OUT OF THE OFFICE AND WE WAITED AWHILE LONGER BUT SID DIDN'T COME SO THE OLD MAN SAID COME ALONG
LAY OVER THE GREAT PRISON HERE AND THERE IN THE GRIM CORRIDORS A GUARD DOZED IN THE GLARE OF AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND IN THE OFFICE TOO A DESK LIGHT
NO SON OF SAINT LOUIS ASCEND TO HEAVEN WROTE DOWN IN HIS BIOGRAPHY NO SIR WE'D A WHOOPED HIM OVER THE BORDER
HE STILL SAT MOTIONLESS WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE BLACK MASK HOW DID YOU PASS THE OUTSIDE GUARD HE WAS BRIBED WAS THE READY RESPONSE NOW WARDEN THE MASKED INTRUDER CONTINUED PACIFICALLY
AND DONE IT JUST AS SLICK AS NOTHING AT ALL TOO
SO WE CRUISED ALONG UP SHORE TILL WE GOT KIND OF TIRED AND BEAT OUT AND TIED UP THE CANOE AND WENT TO SLEEP AND NEVER WAKED UP TILL ABOUT AN HOUR AGO
THE SOUNDS GOT DIM AND DIED OUT AND WHEN WE STEPPED ON TO THE RAFT I SAYS NOW OLD JIM YOU'RE A FREE MAN AGAIN
AND TWICE I WENT DOWN THE ROD AWAY IN THE NIGHT AND SLIPPED AROUND FRONT AND SEE HER SETTING THERE BY HER CANDLE IN THE WINDOW
BUT I TOLD TOM AS QUICK AS I COULD WE MUST JUMP FOR IT NOW AND NOT A MINUTE TO LOSETHE
AND IT KEEPS RUNNING ON AND GETTING WORSE AND WORSE ALL THE TIME AND YOUR WITS GETS TO ADDLING AND YOU GET TO DOING ALL SORTS O WILD THINGS AND BY AND BY YOU THINK TO YOURSELF SPOS'N I WAS A BOY
WHY I WAS THAT SCARED I DASN'T HARDLY GO TO BED OR GET UP OR LAY DOWN OR SET DOWN SISTER RIDGEWAY WHY
NOT IF IT'S FORTY YEAR I KNOWED HE WAS WHITE INSIDE
HE WARN'T THERE TO SUPPER SO RIGHT AFTER SUPPER UNCLE WENT HE COME BACK ABOUT TEN A LITTLE BIT UNEASY
NO SIR I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO I'LL WAIT AND WHEN HE COMES BACK IF HE SAYS HE'S GOT TO GO ANY MORE I'LL GET DOWN THERE TOO IF I SWIM
N HERE SO N SO PEGGED ALONG FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEAR
AS I WAS A TELLING YOU
HE'S DRESSED AND EVERYTHING'S READY NOW WE'LL SLIDE OUT AND GIVE THE SHEEP SIGNAL BUT THEN WE HEARD THE TRAMP OF MEN COMING TO THE DOOR AND HEARD THEM BEGIN TO FUMBLE WITH THE PAD LOCK
BUT YOU'LL BE GOOD WON'T YOU AND YOU WON'T GO FOR MY SAKE LAWS KNOWS I WANTED TO GO BAD ENOUGH TO SEE ABOUT TOM AND WAS ALL INTENDING TO GO
AND GOT HOME LATE TO SUPPER AND FOUND THEM IN SUCH A SWEAT AND WORRY
YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO ME IF YOU CAN ANY OF YOU WELL IT DOES BEAT
OH HE SAYS BUT HE PUT HIS FOOT ON THE GUNNEL AND ROCKED HER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID HE RECKONED HE'D LOOK AROUND FOR A BIGGER ONE BUT THEY WAS ALL LOCKED AND CHAINED
IT HAS BEEN MADE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GIVE AN ALARM THE STRANGER WENT ON THE VERY MEN ON WHOM YOU MOST DEPENDED HAVE BEEN BOUGHT AND EVEN IF THEY WERE WITHIN SOUND OF YOUR VOICE NOW THEY WOULDN'T RESPOND
I LAY IT NEVER SAWED ITSELF OFF
AND LAY FOR THEM DESPERADOES AND SAYING IT WARN'T BUT A FEW MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT AND OTHERS WAS TRYING TO GET THEM TO HOLD ON AND WAIT FOR THE SHEEP SIGNAL AND HERE WAS AUNTY
NO SAH I DOAN BUDGE A STEP OUT'N DIS PLACE
IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE PLEASANT ALL AROUND
AND AS A GENERL THING SHE WOULD BUT I S'POSE THERE WAS SO MANY STRANGE THINGS GOING ON SHE WAS JUST IN A SWEAT ABOUT EVERY LITTLE THING THAT WARN'T YARD STICK STRAIGHT SO SHE SAYS
AND IN THAT AFTER SENSE OF THE SAME WHICH HAD LASTED THREE OR FOUR DAYS THE EFFECT OF HIS FINAL APPEAL HAD IN SHORT FADED AWAY AND ALL THE FIRST YEAR OF HER MARRIAGE HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF HER BOOKS
HEARD FROM HIM AND VERY SELDOM HEARD ANY MENTION OF HIM DEEPENED THIS IMPRESSION OF HIS LONELINESS SHE ASKED LILY FOR NEWS OF HIM FROM TIME TO TIME BUT LILY KNEW NOTHING OF BOSTON
AND SHE WAS HAPPY TO SAY SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SHOW HIM CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION
I HOPE YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU LIKE HIM ISABEL DEBATED NO I DON'T LIKE HIM I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE I'M WEARY OF MY SECRET BUT THAT'S ENOUGH I CAN'T ANNOUNCE IT ON THE HOUSETOPS
AND YET SHE WISHED TO MAKE HER PEACE WITH THE WORLD TO PUT HER SPIRITUAL AFFAIRS IN ORDER IT CAME BACK TO HER FROM TIME TO TIME THAT THERE WAS AN ACCOUNT STILL TO BE SETTLED WITH CASPAR AND SHE SAW HERSELF DISPOSED
ONE HASN'T A NERVE IN ONE'S BODY THAT SHE DOESN'T SET QUIVERING YOU KNOW I NEVER HAVE ADMITTED THAT SHE'S A WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE REMINDS ME OF OF A NEW STEEL PEN THE MOST ODIOUS THING IN NATURE
AT POSILIPPO MADAME MERLE HAD CEASED TO MINISTER TO ISABEL'S HAPPINESS WHO FOUND HERSELF WONDERING WHETHER THE MOST DISCREET OF WOMEN MIGHT NOT ALSO BY CHANCE BE THE MOST DANGEROUS
THE PART HE HAD CHOSEN WAS THE HOTEL SYSTEM AND THE RIVER NAVIGATION HE HAD SEEMED REALLY FASCINATED WITH THE HOTELS HE HAD A PHOTOGRAPH OF EVERY ONE HE HAD VISITED BUT THE RIVER STEAMERS WERE HIS PRINCIPAL INTEREST
HAD HAD QUITE THE CHARACTER OF A COMPLETE RUPTURE IF SHE REMEMBERED RIGHTLY HE HAD SAID HE WISHED TO TAKE HIS LAST LOOK AT HER SINCE THEN HE HAD BEEN THE MOST DISCORDANT SURVIVAL OF HER EARLIER TIME
THE ONLY ONE IN FACT WITH WHICH A PERMANENT PAIN WAS ASSOCIATED HE HAD LEFT HER THAT MORNING WITH A SENSE OF THE MOST SUPERFLUOUS OF SHOCKS IT WAS LIKE A COLLISION BETWEEN VESSELS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
SHE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD INVESTED HIS ALL IN HER HAPPINESS WHILE THE OTHERS HAD INVESTED ONLY A PART HE WAS ONE MORE PERSON FROM WHOM SHE SHOULD HAVE TO CONCEAL HER STRESS SHE WAS REASSURED HOWEVER
JUST AS HE HAD BEEN DRESSED ON THAT DAY
TO COMPLETE THE METAPHOR HAD GIVEN THE LIGHTER VESSEL A STRAIN WHICH STILL OCCASIONALLY BETRAYED ITSELF IN A FAINT CREAKING IT HAD BEEN HORRID TO SEE HIM
SHE HAD GROWN VAGUE OF OLD SHE HAD NEVER BEEN VAGUE THOUGH UNDERTAKING MANY ENQUIRIES AT ONCE SHE HAD MANAGED TO BE ENTIRE AND POINTED ABOUT EACH SHE HAD A REASON FOR EVERYTHING SHE DID
HENRIETTA GAVE A LAUGH DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE RATHER TOO CONSIDERATE IT'S NOT OF HIM THAT I'M CONSIDERATE IT'S OF MYSELF ISABEL ANSWERED IT WAS NOT SURPRISING
HE HAD NOT BEEN VIOLENT AND YET THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLENCE IN THE IMPRESSION THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLENCE AT ANY RATE IN SOMETHING SOMEWHERE PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY IN HER OWN FIT OF WEEPING
SOMETIMES AT NIGHT SHE HAD STRANGE VISIONS SHE SEEMED TO SEE HER HUSBAND AND HER FRIEND HIS FRIEND IN DIM INDISTINGUISHABLE COMBINATION IT SEEMED TO HER
AND YET IN SPITE OF THIS FAMILIAR LOOK THERE WAS A STRANGENESS IN HIS FIGURE TOO SOMETHING THAT MADE HER FEEL IT AFRESH
GILBERT OSMOND SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN COMFORT IN MISS STACKPOLE HIS INSTINCT HAD NATURALLY SET HIM IN OPPOSITION TO A YOUNG LADY CAPABLE OF ADVISING HIS WIFE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE CONJUGAL ROOF WHEN SHE ARRIVED IN ROME
BUT SHE WOULD UNDERTAKE TO SAY IT HAD DONE HIM GOOD HE WASN'T THE SAME MAN WHEN HE LEFT AS HE HAD BEEN WHEN HE CAME IT HAD OPENED HIS EYES AND SHOWN HIM THAT ENGLAND WASN'T EVERYTHING
I DON'T WANT TO BE REMEMBERED THAT WAY MISS STACKPOLE DECLARED I CONSIDER THAT MY CONVERSATION REFERS ONLY TO THE MOMENT LIKE THE MORNING PAPERS YOUR STEPDAUGHTER AS SHE SITS THERE
THAT AS OSMOND DIDN'T LIKE HER SHE COULDN'T INVITE HER TO DINE BUT THEY COULD EASILY SEE EACH OTHER IN OTHER WAYS ISABEL RECEIVED MISS STACKPOLE FREELY IN HER OWN SITTING ROOM AND TOOK HER REPEATEDLY TO DRIVE FACE TO FACE WITH PANSY WHO
SHE THREW HERSELF INTO IT FOR NOW THAT SHE HAD MADE SUCH A POINT OF KEEPING HER CONSCIENCE CLEAR THAT WAS ONE WAY OF PROVING SHE HAD NOT BEEN SUPERFICIAL THE MORE SO AS THE YEARS IN THEIR FLIGHT
BELIEF WAS THE ONLY FORM EXERTION COULD TAKE WITH HIM IT WOULD BE BECAUSE IT WAS AN ENTERPRISING THING
ISABEL COULD HAVE FANCIED SHE HAD SEEN HIM THE DAY BEFORE IT MUST HAVE BEEN WITH JUST THAT FACE AND STEP THAT HE HAD WALKED OUT OF MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DOOR AT THE CLOSE OF THEIR LAST INTERVIEW HE WAS DRESSED
SHE COULD NEVER SAY TO HERSELF THAT HERE WAS A SUFFERER WHO HAD COMPENSATIONS AS SHE WAS ABLE TO SAY IN THE CASE OF HER ENGLISH SUITOR SHE HAD NO FAITH IN MISTER GOODWOOD'S COMPENSATIONS
IN A GIRL OF TWENTY UNNATURAL AND EVEN UNCANNY ISABEL PRESENTLY SAW THAT OSMOND WOULD HAVE LIKED HER TO URGE A LITTLE THE CAUSE OF HER FRIEND INSIST A LITTLE UPON HIS RECEIVING HER
THAT SHE HAD NOT DONE WITH HER THIS LADY HAD SOMETHING IN RESERVE ISABEL'S IMAGINATION APPLIED ITSELF ACTIVELY TO THIS ELUSIVE POINT BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN IT WAS CHECKED BY A NAMELESS DREAD
THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF HE COULD REACH THE ENTRANCE AHEAD OF HER SHE TOO MIGHT BE TALKING AND LAUGHING AS SHE LEFT THE THEATRE JUST A SINGLE WORD JUST A TONE THAT WAS ALL HE ASKED
INEVITABLY WAS WITH HIM AT MOMENTS SUCH AS THESE IT SEEMED IT ALWAYS SEEMED THAT WITH AN UNOPENED LETTER OF HERS IN HIS POSSESSION IT WAS AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO OPEN A PAGE IN THE BOOK OF FATE AND READ
A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE AND A SILVERY LAUGH JUST THAT NO MORE JIMMIE DALE IN HIS FAVOURITE SEAT AN AISLE SEAT SOME SEVEN OR EIGHT ROWS BACK FROM THE ORCHESTRA STARED AT THE STAGE
IN A MEASURE AT LEAST SEEMED TO FORSAKE HIM HE BEGAN TO DRUM NERVOUSLY WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE DESK AND SHIFT UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR AND THEN FROM FIRST ONE POCKET AND THEN THE OTHER
JIMMIE DALE SMILED INDULGENTLY MY MASK IS ONLY FOR EFFECT HE SAID MY NAME IS SMITH YES SAID CARLING I AM VERY STUPID THANK YOU
TO GET BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOME LIFE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES MISSUS MOYNE WAS GENUINELY PLEASED AND GRATEFUL
AUTOMATICALLY HE QUICKENED HIS STEPS A LITTLE IT WAS USELESS FUTILE PROFITLESS FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST TO DISTURB HIMSELF OVER HIS FAILURE THERE WAS THE LETTER
AT THE CORNER HE STOPPED TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE AND THE FLAME OF THE MATCH SPURTING UP DISCLOSED A FACE THAT WAS WORN AND HAGGARD HE THREW THE MATCH AWAY SMILED A LITTLE WEARILY AND WENT ON
HIS EYES TOO HAD IN NO DEGREE RELAXED THEIR VIGILANCE AND ONCE HALF GRIMLY HALF SARDONICALLY HE SMILED TO HIMSELF
POKE GETTER IN THE UNITED STATES THE CROWD THINNED IN THE LOBBY THINNED DOWN TO THE LAST FEW BELATED STRAGGLERS WHO PASSED HIM AS HE STILL LOITERED IN THE ENTRANCE
EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD DONE THE JOB AND HAD THE BALANCE SOMEWHERE WHAT WOULD HIS DENIALS HIS PROTESTATIONS OF INNOCENCE COUNT FOR HE WAS AN EX CONVICT A HARDENED CRIMINAL CAUGHT RED HANDED WITH A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS OF ROBBERY
WITH THE PARCEL UNDER HIS ARM STEPPED TO THE DOOR AND UNLOCKED IT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT ON THE THRESHOLD FOR A SINGLE QUICK COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM THEN PASSED ON OUT INTO THE STREET
MOTIONLESS JIMMIE DALE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE SILENT OUTSTRETCHED FORM THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE DESK AND SLOWLY DELIBERATELY PICKED UP THE SIGNED CONFESSION AND THE STEAMSHIP TICKET HE HELD THEM AN INSTANT
HELD A DISCONCERTING BEAD ON CARLING'S FOREHEAD PLEASE DON'T DO THAT SAID JIMMIE DALE SOFTLY IT'S RATHER A GOOD MAKE THAT SAFE I DARE SAY IT WOULD TAKE ME HALF AN HOUR TO OPEN IT
SAID JIMMIE DALE SLOWLY I HAVEN'T COUNTED IT YOUR BANK WAS ROBBED THIS EVENING AT CLOSING TIME I UNDERSTAND YES CARLING'S VOICE WAS EXCITED NOW
YOUR BANK WAS ROBBED TO NIGHT OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND HERE THE OTHER NINETY THOUSAND ARE IN YOUR SAFE YOU LIE ASHEN TO THE LIPS CARLING HAD RISEN IN HIS CHAIR
YOU'RE WISER THAN YOU KNOW MY MAN THAT'S WHAT WE SUSPECTED
SAID CARLING ICILY YOU REFUSE ABSOLUTELY JIMMIE DALE'S VOICE HAD A LINGERING WISTFUL NOTE IN IT I REFUSE SAID CARLING BLUNTLY I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
THE REST OF THE HOUSE WAS IN DARKNESS YES SAID JIMMIE DALE NODDING HIS HEAD I RATHER THOUGHT SO THE SERVANTS WILL HAVE RETIRED HOURS AGO IT'S SAFE ENOUGH
WITH THEIR PROSPEROUS WELL GROOMED ESCORTS THERE WAS THE WOWZER OVER THERE SLEEK DAPPER SQUIRMING IN AND OUT OF THE THRONG WITH THE AGILITY AND STEALTH OF A CAT AS LARRY THE BAT HE HAD MET THE WOWZER MANY TIMES
I WANT TO SEE MISTER THOMAS H CARLING CASHIER OF THE HUDSON MERCANTILE NATIONAL BANK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SAID JIMMIE DALE EARNESTLY I AM MISTER CARLING REPLIED THE OTHER WHAT IS IT
FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS AND GOD KNOWS HOW MANY BEFORE THAT YOU'VE GONE THE PACE THE LAVISHNESS OF THIS BACHELOR ESTABLISHMENT OF YOURS IS COMMON TALK IN NEW YORK FAR IN EXCESS OF A BANK CASHIER'S SALARY
WHO WAS ALREADY ASLEEP IN BED
AND IT WAS SAFER MUCH MORE CIRCUMSPECT ON YOUR PART NOT TO ORDER THE FLAT SEARCHED AT ONCE BUT ONLY AS A LAST RESORT AS IT WERE AFTER YOU HAD LED THE POLICE TO TRAIL HIM ALL EVENING AND STILL REMAIN WITHOUT A CLEW
THOMAS H CARLING FROM THE PAPER JIMMIE DALE'S EYES SHIFTED TO THE FIGURE BY THE COUCH AND THE PAPER FLUTTERED SUDDENLY FROM HIS FINGERS TO THE DESK CARLING WAS REELING CLUTCHING AT HIS THROAT
HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE FROM THE SIDEWALK WATCHING WITH A SORT OF SPECULATIVE SATISFACTION A MAN'S SHADOW THAT PASSED CONSTANTLY TO AND FRO ACROSS THE DRAWN BLINDS OF ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS
BUT YOU HOW DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU ARE RETURNING THE MONEY TO THE BANK EXACTLY SAID JIMMIE DALE CARLING WAS ONCE MORE THE POMPOUS BANK OFFICIAL
HIS VOICE WAS RISING GRADUALLY WELL SIR LET ME TELL YOU THAT MISTER CARLING SAID JIMMIE DALE IN A LOW EVEN TONE UNLESS YOU MODERATE YOUR VOICE SOME ONE IN THE HOUSE MIGHT HEAR YOU I AM QUITE WELL AWARE OF THAT
MY HAND IS SWOLLEN AS BIG AS A PUDDING I EXPECT THE NAILS IN HER HORRIBLE BOOTS WERE POISONED JUST THEN SOME ONE WHO SEEMED TO HAVE A RIGHT TO INTERFERE SAID EVERYTHING IS OVER NOW YOU HAD BETTER GO HOME SO THEY WENT
WHEN MOTHER SEEMED SAFE THE CHILDREN RETURNED TO THE CARPET AND SAID HOME' AND HOME THEY WENT I DON'T CARE ABOUT BEING INVISIBLE MYSELF SAID CYRIL AT LEAST NOT WITH MY OWN FAMILY
MOTHER AND THE LAMB WENT AWAY AND FATHER WENT AWAY AND THERE WAS A NEW COOK WHO LOOKED SO LIKE A FRIGHTENED RABBIT THAT NO ONE HAD THE HEART TO DO ANYTHING TO FRIGHTEN HER ANY MORE THAN SEEMED NATURAL TO HER THE PHOENIX BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED
THEN SHE SMILED QUITE A JOLLY SMILE WHY SO I AM SHE SAID WHAT A FUNNY IDEA WHY SHOULDN'T I BE IN A GOOD TEMPER MY DEARS ONCE MORE THE CARPET HAD DONE ITS WORK AND NOT ON MISSUS BIDDLE ALONE
CRIED THE LAMB IT WAS A DELICIOUS MOMENT EVEN THE BOYS THUMPED THEIR BABY BROTHER JOYOUSLY ON THE BACK THEN ANTHEA GLANCED AT MOTHER
THE DOCILE CARPET SWIRLED THEIR SENSES AWAY AND RESTORED THEM ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A GLEAMING WHITE INDIAN TOWN THEY KNEW IT WAS INDIAN AT ONCE BY THE SHAPE OF THE DOMES AND ROOFS AND BESIDES A MAN WENT BY ON AN ELEPHANT
AND DADDY'S ANXIOUS ABOUT IT AND THE LAMB'S COUGH HE HASN'T COUGHED SINCE SATURDAY THE LAMB'S ELDEST SISTER INTERRUPTED I WISH I COULD THINK SO MOTHER REPLIED AND DADDY'S GOT TO GO TO SCOTLAND I DO HOPE YOU'LL BE GOOD CHILDREN
HE FOUND THE OTHERS AND SAID IT'S NO USE SHE'S LIKE A LIONESS ROBBED OF ITS PUPPIES WE MUST WATCH WHERE IT GOES AND ANTHEA I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY IT'S OUR OWN CARPET IT WOULDN'T BE BURGLARY
AND TO FEEL WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IS THE WORST SORT OF GHOST FEELING MOTHER PICKED UP THE LAMB AND HURRIED AWAY FROM THE PINEWOOD LET'S GO HOME SAID JANE AFTER A MISERABLE SILENCE IT FEELS JUST EXACTLY AS IF MOTHER DIDN'T LOVE US
IT GOT TO THE BAZAAR BY MISTAKE WITH SOME OTHER THINGS DID IT REALLY NOW HOW VEXING SAID MISSUS BIDDLE KINDLY WELL MY DEARS I CAN VERY WELL GIVE THE EXTRA TEN SHILLINGS
EXACTED IN THE AGITATION OF PARTING THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE OUT AFTER SIX AT NIGHT EXCEPT ON SATURDAY WHEN THEY WERE TO GO TO THE BAZAAR AND WERE PLEDGED TO PUT ON THEIR BEST CLOTHES TO WASH THEMSELVES TO THE UTTERMOST AND TO CLEAN THEIR NAILS
THAT EGG YOU KNOW THAT CAME IN THE CARPET WE PUT IT IN THE FIRE AND IT HATCHED INTO THE PHOENIX AND THE CARPET WAS A WISHING CARPET AND A VERY NICE GAME DARLING SAID MOTHER TAKING UP HER PEN NOW DO BE QUIET I'VE GOT A LOT OF LETTERS TO WRITE

THE OTHER STALL HOLDERS LEFT THEIR THINGS AT THE SCHOOL TILL MONDAY MORNING BUT MISSUS BIDDLE WAS AFRAID SOME ONE WOULD STEAL SOME OF THEM SO SHE TOOK THEM IN A CAB THE CHILDREN NOW TOO DESPERATE TO CARE FOR MUD OR APPEARANCES
THAT WHAT SHE WAS WALKING ON WAS NOT A SCHOOLROOM FLOOR OR EVEN AS SHE PRESENTLY SUPPOSED A DROPPED PIN CUSHION BUT THE LIVING HAND OF A SUFFERING CHILD WHEN SHE BECAME AWARE THAT SHE REALLY HAD HURT HIM SHE GREW VERY ANGRY INDEED
THERE WAS NO FINDING THE PHOENIX SO THEY SAT ON THE BEAUTIFUL WISHING CARPET AND SAID WE WANT INDIAN THINGS FOR MOTHER'S BAZAAR WILL YOU PLEASE TAKE US WHERE PEOPLE WILL GIVE US HEAPS OF INDIAN THINGS
BUT EVERY ONE WAS AGREED THAT IF THEY APPEARED SUDDENLY IN BOURNEMOUTH IT WOULD FRIGHTEN MOTHER OUT OF HER WITS IF NOT INTO A FIT SO THEY SAT ON THE CARPET AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL THEY ALMOST BEGAN TO SQUINT LOOK HERE SAID CYRIL I KNOW
JUST AS SHE FINISHED SPEAKING A VERY BROWN GENTLEMAN IN A TURBAN CAME UP TO THEM AND BOWED DEEPLY
WE WILL WE WILL SAID ANTHEA FERVENTLY WHEN'S THE BAZAAR ON SATURDAY SAID MOTHER AT THE SCHOOLS OH DON'T TALK ANY MORE THERE'S A TREASURE MY HEAD'S GOING ROUND AND I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW TO SPELL WHOOPING COUGH
I'M SO SORRY I STEPPED ON YOUR HAND MY BOY IS IT ALL RIGHT NOW YES THANK YOU SAID ROBERT I SAY YOU ARE GOOD
AND SHE WAS STARING AT THE LAMB AS IF SHE THOUGHT HE HAD GONE MAD AND INDEED THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID THINK MY LAMB MY PRECIOUS COME TO MOTHER SHE CRIED AND JUMPED UP AND RAN TO THE BABY
BUT MOTHER SAID ANTHEA WHEN MOTHER PUT DOWN THE PEN TO LICK AN ENVELOPE THE CARPET TAKES US WHEREVER WE LIKE AND I WISH IT WOULD TAKE YOU WHERE YOU COULD GET A FEW NICE EASTERN THINGS FOR MY BAZAAR SAID MOTHER
WELL I WOULDN'T TAKE HER BACK AFTER THE WAY SHE HAS BEHAVED IT'S NOT HER FAULT SAID ANTHEA
WE WERE LOOKING AT THE THINGS IN THE CORNER SUCH NASTY PRYING WAYS SAID MISSUS BIDDLE WILL NEVER MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE THERE'S NOTHING THERE BUT PACKING AND DUST OH ISN'T THERE SAID JANE THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW
HIS APRONS WOULD COME IN SO USEFUL WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO MARRY A BISHOP MISS PEASMARSH IT WAS THEN THAT THEY DRAGGED HER AWAY AS IT WAS ROBERT'S HAND THAT MISSUS BIDDLE HAD WALKED ON IT WAS DECIDED THAT HE HAD BETTER NOT RECALL THE INCIDENT TO HER MIND
THEY'D THINK IT WAS SHAM OR ELSE THEY'D WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE GOT IT SO THEN THE QUEEN SENT OUT FOR LITTLE PRETTY THINGS AND HER SERVANTS PILED THE CARPET WITH THEM I MUST NEEDS LEND YOU AN ELEPHANT TO CARRY THEM AWAY SHE SAID LAUGHING BUT ANTHEA SAID
SO THAT WHEN WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON BROUGHT AN UNEXPECTED HOLIDAY AND EVERY ONE DECIDED TO GO SOMEWHERE ON THE CARPET THE JOURNEY HAD TO BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT THE PHOENIX
NOT WITH SCISSORS WHICH ARE SCRATCHY AND BAD BUT WITH FLAT SHARPENED ENDS OF WOODEN MATCHES WHICH DO NO HARM TO ANY ONE'S NAILS LET'S GO AND SEE THE LAMB SAID JANE
MISS PEASMARSH WAS VERY WILLING FOR NOW HER STALL THAT HAD BEEN SO NEGLECTED WAS SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BUY AND SHE WAS GLAD TO BE HELPED THE CHILDREN NOTED THAT MISSUS BIDDLE HAD NOT MORE TO DO IN THE WAY OF SELLING THAN SHE COULD MANAGE QUITE WELL
IN A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE MONOGRAMS WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE MAKERS OF CERTAIN PIPES FOUND IN QUANTITIES AT VARIOUS PLACES BY REFERENCE TO THE FREEMAN AND BURGESS ROLLS AND PARISH REGISTERS DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ENGLISH PIPES
HAS LEFT A MANUSCRIPT DIARY RELATING TO HIS RELIGIOUS WORK IN IT UNDER DATE SIXTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HE MENTIONS THAT HE HAD SPOKEN AGAINST THE INORDINATE AFFECTION TO AND THE IMMODERATE USE OF TOBACCO WHICH DID CAUS MUCH TROUBLE IN SOME OF MY HEARERS
TAKE IT WITHOUT ANY MANIFEST INCONVENIENCE IT QUENCHETH THIRST AND YET WILL MAKE ONE MORE ABLE AND FIT TO DRINK IT ABATES HUNGER AND YET WILL GET ONE A GOOD STOMACH IT IS AGREEABLE WITH MIRTH OR SADNESS WITH FEASTING AND WITH FASTING
THAT HAD LONG BEEN ABSENT FROM ENGLISH LIFE THE FOLLOWING SONG IN PRAISE OF TOBACCO TAKEN FROM A COLLECTION WHICH WAS PRINTED IN SIXTEEN SIXTY IS TOUCHED WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE TIME THOUGH IT IS REALLY FOUNDED ON AND TO NO SMALL EXTENT TAKEN FROM
THAT ON A LEAF CAN DINE HE NEEDS NO LINNEN FOR TO FOUL HIS FINGERS ENDS TO WIPE THAT HAS HIS KITCHIN IN A BOX AND ROAST MEAT IN A PIPE THE CAUSE WHEREFORE FEW RICH MEN'S SONS
HEE THREW HIS TOBACCO IN THE FIRE AND HIS PIPES AT THE WALLS RESOLVING NEVER TO MEDDLE MORE WITH IT SOE MUCH MONEY AS WAS FORMERLY WASTED BY THE WEEK IN TO SERVING HIS FAMILY AFTERWARD WEEKLY
AND CONSUME AN HOUR IN SMOKING AND TALKING SPENDING SEVERAL HOURS OF THE EVENING IN SIMILAR FASHION COUNTRY GENTLEMEN SMOKED JUST AS MUCH AS TOWN MECHANICS AND TRADESMEN IN SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT HERVEY AFTERWARDS EARL OF BRISTOL
AT THE TIME OF THE DREADFUL VISITATION OF SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE ALL THE BOYS AT ETON WERE OBLIGED TO SMOKE IN SCHOOL EVERY MORNING ONE OF THESE JUVENILE SMOKERS A CERTAIN TOM ROGERS
WERE PRESENTED BY COLONISTS IN AMERICA TO THE INDIANS THEY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME VALUABLE AS OBJECTS OF BARTER OR PART PURCHASE VALUE IN EXCHANGE FOR LAND IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PIPES AND ONE HUNDRED JEW'S HARPS WERE GIVEN FOR A STRIP OF COUNTRY NEAR TIMBER CREEK
SO THAT NONE MAY FOLLOW THE TRADE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN APPRENTICES SEVEN YEARS TOBACCO PIPE MAKING WAS A FLOURISHING INDUSTRY AT THIS PERIOD AND THROUGHOUT THE SEVENTEENTH AND FOLLOWING CENTURY IN MOST OF THE CHIEF PROVINCIAL TOWNS AND CITIES
SOME THEREIN WERE SLEEPING OTHERS SWEARING OTHERS SMOAKING TOBACCO IN THE CHIMNEY OF THE ROOM I BELIEVE THERE WAS TWO BUSHELS OF BROKEN TOBACCO PIPES ALMOST HALF ONE LOAD OF ASHES WHAT WOULD THE KING'S GRANDFATHER THE AUTHOR OF THE COUNTERBLASTE HAVE SAID
AN ENGLISH WRITER ON THRIFT IN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SIX SAID THAT IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR A MECHANIC TRADESMAN TO GO TO THE COFFEE HOUSE OR ALE HOUSE IN THE MORNING TO DRINK HIS MORNING'S DRAUGHT AND THERE HE WOULD SPEND TWOPENCE
JACOB SMITH IT DOTH BELONG AT THE BLACK LYON IN HIGH HOLBORN DATE AUGUST SIXTEEN SEVENTY ONE SMOKERS OF THE PERIOD WERE OFTEN CURIOUS IN TOBACCO BOXES
THESE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PIPES WERE LARGELY MADE IN HOLLAND OF PIPE CLAY IMPORTED FROM ENGLAND TO THE DISGUST AND LOSS OF ENGLISH PIPE MAKERS IN SIXTEEN SIXTY THREE THE COMPANY OF TOBACCO PIPE MAKERS
PETITIONED PARLIAMENT TO FORBID THE EXPORT OF TOBACCO PIPE CLAY SINCE BY THE MANUFACTURE OF PIPES IN HOLLAND THEIR TRADE IS MUCH DAMAGED FURTHER THEY ASKED FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF THEIR CHARTER OF GOVERNMENT SO AS TO EMPOWER THEM TO REGULATE ABUSES
BUT MORE GENERALLY UPON THE SPUR OR FLAT HEEL OF THE PIPE MANY PIPES DISPLAY ON THE HEELS VARIOUS FORMS OF LINES HATCHED AND MILLED WHICH WERE PERHAPS THE EARLIEST MARKS OF IDENTIFICATION ADOPTED BY THE PIPE MAKERS
IN DECEMBER SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE FOR
THIS TOO WAS DOUBTLESS VIRGINIAN OR COLONIAL TOBACCO THE NORTH ELMHAM CHURCH ACCOUNTS NORFOLK
MISTER RICHARD STAPLEY GENTLEMAN OF TWINEHAM SUSSEX WHOSE DIARY IS FULL OF CURIOUS INFORMATION WAS PRESENTED IN SIXTEEN NINETY ONE BY HIS FRIEND MISTER JOHN HILL WITH A TOBACCO BOX MADE OF TORTOISE SEVEN YEARS EARLIER STAPLEY HAD SOLD TO HILL
AS A PRESERVATIVE FROM CONTAGION AT TIMES OF PLAGUE HEARNE THE ANTIQUARY WRITING EARLY IN SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT IN THE GREAT PLAGUE OF LONDON OF SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE
AND THAT AT A STATED HOUR EACH MORNING LESSONS WERE LAID ASIDE AND MASTERS AND SCHOLARS ALIKE PRODUCED THEIR PIPES AND PROCEEDED TO SMOKE TOBACCO BUT I KNOW OF NO AUTHORITY FOR THIS WIDER STATEMENT IT SEEMS TO HAVE GROWN OUT OF HEARNE'S RECORD OF THE PRACTICE AT ETON
WINSTANLEY WHO WAS AN ENEMY OF WHAT HE CALLED THIS HEATHENISH WEED AND WHO THOUGHT THE FOLLY OF SMOKING MIGHT NEVER HAVE SPREAD SO MUCH IF STRINGENT MEANS OF PREVENTION HAD BEEN EXERCISED YET HAD TO DECLARE IN SIXTEEN SIXTY THAT
AND I HAD HIS STEEL BOX WITH THE BARGAIN AND FULL OF SMOAKE
FOR WHEN ONE TAKES IT EITHER BY CHEWING IT IN THE LEAF OR SMOAKING IT IN THE PIPE
A LATER CULLUM SIR JOHN
BUTTER CHEESE BREAD CAKES BEERE AND TOBACCO AND TOBACCO PIPES AT THE GOEING OF THE ROUNDS OF THE TOWNE ON THE OCCASION OF A SIMILAR PERAMBULATION OF THE PARISH BOUNDARIES IN SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN
DECLARED THAT THE ENGLISH WERE NATURALLY LAZY AND SPENT HALF THEIR TIME IN TAKING TOBACCO THEY SMOKED AFTER MEALS HE OBSERVED AND CONVERSED FOR A LONG TIME THERE IS SCARCE A DAY PASSES HE WROTE BUT A TRADESMAN GOES TO THE ALE HOUSE OR TAVERN TO SMOKE WITH SOME OF HIS FRIENDS
BROUGHT THEIR PROVISIONS IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THIS CRUEL AFFLICTION NEVER ATTEMPTED THE PREMISES OF A TOBACCONIST A TANNER OR A SHOEMAKER WHATEVER GROUND THERE MAY HAVE BEEN FOR THE BELIEF IN THE PROPHYLACTIC EFFECT OF SMOKING
NONE OF THOSE WHO KEPT TOBACCONISTS SHOPS SUFFERED FROM IT AND THIS BELIEF NO DOUBT ENHANCED THE MEDICAL REPUTATION OF THE WEED I HAVE ALSO SEEN IT STATED THAT DURING THE CHOLERA EPIDEMICS OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX NOT ONE LONDON TOBACCONIST DIED FROM THAT DISEASE
THE MORNING HEE FELL TO HIS OLD COURS NOTWITHSTANDING THINKING IT WAS BUT A DREAM BUT WHEN HEE CAME TO TAKE HIS PIPE HEE HAD SUCH AN APPREHENSION THAT THE DEVILL DID INDEED STAND BY HIM AND DOE THE OFFICE AS HEE DREAMED THAT HEE WAS STRUCK SPEECHLESS FOR A TIME AND WHEN HEE CAME TO HIMSELF
OF SMOAK THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT KING CHARLES SMOKED NOR WHAT HIS PERSONAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS TOBACCO MAY HAVE BEEN HIS MAJESTY WAS PLEASED HOWEVER IN A LETTER TO CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY
SHE WAS QUITE TERRIFIED AT FINDING IT SO BROWN AND UGLY BUT WHEN SHE WETTED HER LITTLE HAND AND RUBBED HER EYES AND FOREHEAD THE WHITE SKIN GLEAMED FORTH ONCE MORE
WERE THE BEAUTIFUL EVER CHANGING CLOUD PALACES OF THE FATA MORGANA INTO WHICH NO MORTAL CAN ENTER ELIZA WAS STILL GAZING AT THE SCENE WHEN MOUNTAINS FORESTS AND CASTLES MELTED AWAY
SO SHE PUT THE TOADS INTO CLEAR WATER AND THEY TURNED GREEN IMMEDIATELY SHE NEXT CALLED ELIZA AND HELPED HER TO UNDRESS AND GET INTO THE BATH AS ELIZA DIPPED HER HEAD UNDER THE WATER
AND IF SHE TOUCHED A TWIG WITH HER HAND EVER SO LIGHTLY THE BRILLIANT FIREFLIES FELL DOWN AROUND HER LIKE SHOOTING STARS ALL NIGHT LONG SHE DREAMED OF HER BROTHERS
FAR AWAY IN THE LAND TO WHICH THE SWALLOWS FLY WHEN IT IS WINTER DWELT A KING WHO HAD ELEVEN SONS AND ONE DAUGHTER NAMED ELIZA
DURING THE WHOLE OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WHILE HER BROTHERS WERE ABSENT SHE SAT IN SOLITUDE BUT NEVER BEFORE HAD THE TIME FLOWN SO QUICKLY ONE COAT WAS ALREADY FINISHED
IT SEEMED SO STRANGE TO HER TO FEEL HERSELF BEING CARRIED SO HIGH IN THE AIR OVER THE SEA BY HER SIDE LAY A BRANCH FULL OF BEAUTIFUL RIPE BERRIES AND A BUNDLE OF SWEET ROOTS
THAT FROM THE MOMENT YOU COMMENCE YOUR TASK UNTIL IT IS FINISHED EVEN SHOULD IT OCCUPY YEARS OF YOUR LIFE YOU MUST NOT SPEAK THE FIRST WORD YOU UTTER
LIKE A LONG WHITE RIBBON THEN ELIZA WENT DOWN THE SLOPE FROM THE SHORE AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE BUSHES THE SWANS ALIGHTED QUITE CLOSE TO HER
WHERE THEIR SISTER ELIZA LAY ASLEEP IN HER ROOM THEY HOVERED OVER THE ROOF TWISTED THEIR LONG NECKS AND FLAPPED THEIR WINGS BUT NO ONE HEARD THEM OR SAW THEM SO THEY WERE AT LAST OBLIGED TO FLY AWAY
AND THAT HER FATHER MAY NOT KNOW HER REST ON HER HEART SHE WHISPERED TO THE THIRD THEN SHE WILL HAVE EVIL INCLINATIONS AND SUFFER IN CONSEQUENCE
NOT A SINGLE GLOWWORM GLITTERED IN THE MOSS SORROWFULLY SHE LAID HERSELF DOWN TO SLEEP AND AFTER A WHILE IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES PARTED OVER HER HEAD
WHEN THE SUN SET THEY WOULD CHANGE TO MEN FALL INTO THE SEA AND BE DROWNED THEN SHE OFFERED A PRAYER FROM HER INMOST HEART BUT STILL NO APPEARANCE OF THE ROCK
SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE FALLING BUT THEY AGAIN SOARED ONWARD PRESENTLY SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE ROCK JUST BELOW THEM AND BY THIS TIME THE SUN WAS HALF HIDDEN BY THE WAVES
AND HIS BEAMS WERE GLANCING THROUGH THE LEAVES HERE AND THERE LIKE A GOLDEN MIST THERE WAS A SWEET FRAGRANCE FROM THE FRESH VERDURE AND THE BIRDS ALMOST PERCHED UPON HER SHOULDERS
AND THAT THE MILD EYES OF ANGELS LOOKED DOWN UPON HER FROM HEAVEN WHEN SHE AWOKE IN THE MORNING SHE KNEW NOT WHETHER SHE HAD DREAMED THIS OR IF IT HAD REALLY BEEN SO
AND THE LOVELIEST MAIDENS TO DANCE AFTERWARDS HE LED HER THROUGH FRAGRANT GARDENS AND LOFTY HALLS BUT NOT A SMILE APPEARED ON HER LIPS OR SPARKLED IN HER EYES
AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE AND HER BROTHERS AGAIN BECAME WILD SWANS THEY TOOK UP THE NET WITH THEIR BEAKS AND FLEW UP TO THE CLOUDS WITH THEIR DEAR SISTER WHO STILL SLEPT THE SUNBEAMS FELL ON HER FACE
EARLY ONE MORNING THE QUEEN WENT INTO THE BATHROOM IT WAS BUILT OF MARBLE AND HAD SOFT CUSHIONS TRIMMED WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TAPESTRY SHE TOOK THREE TOADS WITH HER
THEY WERE NOT WRITING LINES AND LETTERS AS THEY USED TO DO BUT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NOBLE DEEDS THEY HAD PERFORMED AND OF ALL THEY HAD DISCOVERED AND SEEN IN THE PICTURE BOOK TOO
STOOD NEAR HER SHE UTTERED A LOUD CRY FOR ALTHOUGH THEY WERE VERY MUCH CHANGED SHE KNEW THEM IMMEDIATELY SHE SPRANG INTO THEIR ARMS AND CALLED THEM EACH BY NAME
SHE FOUND IT WAS ONLY A SEA MIST GLIDING OVER THE OCEAN SO THERE CONTINUED TO PASS BEFORE HER EYES A CONSTANT CHANGE OF SCENE TILL AT LAST
SO THAT SHE WAS QUITE BROWN THEN SHE TANGLED HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR AND SMEARED IT WITH DISGUSTING OINTMENT TILL IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOGNIZE THE BEAUTIFUL ELIZA WHEN HER FATHER SAW HER
THE CHARCOAL BURNERS SING THE OLD SONGS TO WHICH WE HAVE DANCED AS CHILDREN THIS IS OUR FATHERLAND TO WHICH WE ARE DRAWN BY LOVING TIES AND HERE WE HAVE FOUND YOU OUR DEAR LITTLE SISTER
WAS ONLY A WITCH WHO HAD BLINDED THE KING'S EYES AND ENCHANTED HIS HEART BUT THE KING WOULD NOT LISTEN TO THIS HE ORDERED THE MUSIC TO SOUND THE DAINTIEST DISHES TO BE SERVED
THEREFORE ONE OF THE SWANS SOARED OVER HER HEAD SO THAT HIS BROAD WING MIGHT SHADE HER THEY WERE FAR FROM THE LAND WHEN ELIZA WOKE SHE THOUGHT SHE MUST STILL BE DREAMING
HIS NOSE IS PERFECTLY ODIOUS YES
JUNE THIRTIETH NINETEEN ELEVEN IS A RED LETTER DAY IN THE FRAM'S HISTORY
GO QUICKER ANDRUSHA YOU ARE A HORRIBLY LONG TIME OVER THE JOURNEY THIS MORNING BUT AT LENGTH THE GOAL WAS REACHED AND THE KOLIASKA STOPPED BEFORE A ONE STORIED WOODEN MANSION DARK GREY IN COLOUR AND
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN AND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE FATHOMS
AND EVERLASTING TIMIDITY FOR INSTANCE THE MEN'S PARTY DECLARED THAT THE WHOLE STORY WAS RUBBISH THAT THE ALLEGED ABDUCTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER
THIS GENTLEMAN ASKED US IF WE COULD NOT COME INTO THE HARBOUR AS PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SHIP I PROMISED TO COME IN ON THE WAY BACK IF WE HAD TIME ON SUNDAY MORNING THE ELEVENTH
WHICH REST IN BEARINGS ON THE FRAME SO THAT THE CYLINDER CAN BE SWUNG ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREES STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN THE CYLINDER WHILE BEING LOWERED IN AN INVERTED POSITION IS OPEN AT BOTH ENDS SO THAT THE WATER CAN PASS THROUGH
AND MUST THEREFORE BE SOUGHT FOR WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE WHILE THE SECOND DOCUMENT WAS A LETTER FROM THE GOVERNOR OF A NEIGHBOURING PROVINCE WITH REGARD TO A MALEFACTOR WHO HAD THERE EVADED APPREHENSION A LETTER CONVEYING ALSO A WARNING THAT
LISTEN TO WHAT FATHER CYRIL'S WIFE HAD TO TELL ME SHE SAID THAT
YES BUT TELL ME WHAT IS IN YOUR MIND UPON THIS THE VISITOR HAD TO CONFESS HERSELF NONPLUSSED FOR THOUGH CAPABLE OF GROWING HYSTERICAL SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF PROPOUNDING ANY RATIONAL THEORY
WHEREUPON CHICHIKOV HAD DECIDED TO CARRY OUT THE ABDUCTION ALLEGED TO THE FOREGOING OF COURSE THERE BECAME APPENDED VARIOUS ADDITIONAL PROOFS AND ITEMS OF EVIDENCE
AND TO ASCERTAIN FROM THEM THE SERVANTS CERTAIN DETAILS WITH REGARD TO THEIR MASTER'S LIFE AND ANTECEDENTS YET EVEN FROM THIS SOURCE
ARRIVED ALL PALE AND TREMBLING AND TOLD HER OH SUCH THINGS
IN FACT SHE FELT DRIVEN TO INQUIRE WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE TO BE HIDDEN BENEATH IT ALL NO TELL ME
ON THE THIRD DAY WE MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO GET THE BOTTOM THIS TIME WE GOT SPECIMENS OF THE SEA BED FROM ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRES
AND IRREFUTABLY MATERIALISED THEY STOOD STRIPPED OF ALL DOUBT AND OTHER IMPEDIMENTA SAID SOME OF THE LADIES IN QUESTION CHICHIKOV HAD LONG BEEN IN LOVE WITH THE MAIDEN
OF COURSE MADAME KOROBOTCHKA ANSWERED REASONABLY ENOUGH I CANNOT SELL YOU THOSE SOULS
IN BRIEF THEY DISPLAYED EVERYWHERE THE MALE BENT THE RUDE
ON THE EVENING OF JULY TWENTY NINTH SAINT HELENA WAS PASSED IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN THIS HISTORIC ISLAND IT WAS VERY STRANGE TO THINK THAT THE GREATEST SPIRIT OF A HUNDRED CENTURIES AS SOME AUTHOR HAS CALLED NAPOLEON
TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE ONE THOUSAND AND NINETY THREE FATHOMS AND SO ON AND WATER CYLINDERS WERE PUT ON FROM ZERO TO TWO THOUSAND METRES
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED IT WELL TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I GUESSED IT AS SOON AS EVER YOU OPENED YOUR MOUTH SO MUCH THEN FOR EDUCATING GIRLS LIKE THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER AT SCHOOL JUST SEE WHAT COMES OF IT
PETRIFIED GENUINE AMAZEMENT MY GOD SHE CRIED
AND TEMPERATURES OCCUPIED EIGHT HOURS FROM SEVEN A M TILL THREE P M
DID THE VISITOR LET FALL A REMARK WHICH LED HER ENTERTAINER TO INQUIRE AND HOW IS THE UNIVERSAL CHARMER
THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES APPEARED TO HER LONGER THAN USUAL AND IN PARTICULAR DID THE FRONT OF THE WHITE STONE HOSPITAL WITH ITS ROWS OF NARROW WINDOWS SEEM INTERMINABLE
THE FRAM LOOKED BRIGHTER THAN I SUPPOSE SHE HAS EVER DONE SINCE SHE WAS NEW
WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND WENT OUT IN THE MOST LOVELY WEATHER THAT CAN BE IMAGINED GRADUALLY THE LAND DISAPPEARED AND IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING WE LOST THE LIGHTS WE WERE ONCE MORE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC
WHAT A PRETTY CHINTZ SHE CRIED GAZING AT THE OTHER'S GOWN YES IT IS PRETTY AGREED THE VISITOR
I SWEAR THAT THEY ARE STILL ALIVE IN SHORT HE MADE SUCH A SCENE THAT THE WHOLE VILLAGE CAME RUNNING TO THE HOUSE AND CHILDREN SCREAMED AND MEN SHOUTED
FROM THE END OF THE LINE WHERE A SMALL WEIGHT A HANGS THEN IT IS LOWERED UNTIL THE INDICATOR WHEEL
WHEN THIS SINKER STRIKES THE FIRST APPARATUS A SPRING IS PRESSED
AT THE REQUIRED DEPTH REMAINS IN IT WHILE IT IS BEING HEAVED UP AND IS COLLECTED IN BOTTLES WHEN THE APPARATUS IS RELEASED THE COLUMN OF MERCURY IN THE THERMOMETER IS BROKEN
AND ENGINE POWER THE NUMBER OF STATIONS WAS SIXTY IN ALL AND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE SAMPLES OF WATER WERE TAKEN OF PLANKTON SPECIMENS ONE HUNDRED NINETY WERE SENT HOME THE FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THESE SPECIMENS IN NORWAY
FORTY ONE FIFTY FOUR EIGHTY ONE ONE HUNDRED EIGHT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE FOUR HUNDRED TEN AND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SIX FATHOMS IN ALL
BOTH DECK HOUSES THE BOATS AND THE VARIOUS WINCHES
GOES WITHOUT SAYING THE FISHERMEN INCLUDED AS THEY TOOK IT ALL IN GOOD PART AS A FISHING BOAT THE FRAM IS ON THE WHOLE NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL
THIS WORK EVERY DAY REMINDED ME OF THE CORVETTE ELLIDA WHEN THE ORDER WAS ALL HANDS ALOFT AS A RULE THOUGH IT WAS ONLY CLEWING UP THE SAILS THAT HAD TO BE DONE AS WE ALWAYS HAD TO TAKE SOUNDINGS ON THE WEATHER SIDE
OR RATHER THEY PRICKED THEMSELVES UP AND STRAIGHTENED HERSELF AND BECAME SOMEHOW MORE MODISH AND DESPITE HER NOT INCONSIDERABLE WEIGHT POSED HERSELF TO LOOK LIKE A PIECE OF THISTLEDOWN FLOATING ON THE BREEZE THE DEAD SOULS BEGAN THE HOSTESS
HE PROFFERED VARIOUS CORROBORATING CIRCUMSTANCES I SEE HIM MYSELF HE SAID I SEE HIM COMING ALONG BY THE CRAB TREE MEADOW ON A BALD FACED HOSS I'D JUST BEEN T HEV A PINT
WI THE CELLAR FULL O WATER AND FROGS AND TOADS HOPPIN UP THE STEPS BY DOZENS AND THE FLOORS ROTTEN AND THE RATS AND MICE GNAWING EVERY BIT O CHEESE AND RUNNIN OVER OUR HEADS AS WE LIE BED TILL WE EXPECT EM TO EAT US UP ALIVE
IN THESE CASES WE SOMETIMES FORM OUR JUDGMENT ON WHAT SEEMS TO US STRONG EVIDENCE AND YET FOR WANT OF KNOWING SOME SMALL FACT OUR JUDGMENT IS WRONG BUT SUPPOSE THE WORST YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY
INDEED SIR IF IT'S ANYTHING T OUR ADVANTAGE
WI INS AN OUTS TO FIT INT EVERYTHING ELSE IF YOU COULD MAKE A PUDDING WI THINKING O THE BATTER IT UD BE EASY GETTING DINNER
SHE ALWAYS CITED IT AFTERWARDS AS A CASE OF PREVISION WHICH REALLY HAD SOMETHING MORE IN IT THAN HER OWN REMARKABLE PENETRATION THAT THE MOMENT SHE SET EYES ON THE SQUIRE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I SHOULDNA WONDER IF HE'S COME ABOUT THAT MAN
NOT YET I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY
THANK YOU I WILL DO SO I WANT TO CONSULT HIM ABOUT A LITTLE MATTER BUT YOU ARE QUITE AS MUCH CONCERNED IN IT IF NOT MORE I MUST HAVE YOUR OPINION TOO HETTY RUN AND TELL YOUR UNCLE TO COME IN
YOU NEVER SAW HER SIR DID YOU YES I DID I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HER SHE PLEASED ME A GOOD DEAL AND NOW YOU MENTION IT I WISH SHE WOULD COME FOR IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A GENTLE MILD WOMAN LIKE HER
TILL A PLACE TUMBLES DOWN AND NOT THEN ON'Y WI BEGGING AND PRAYING AND HAVING TO PAY HALF AND BEING STRUNG UP WI THE RENT AS IT'S MUCH IF HE GETS ENOUGH OUT O THE LAND TO PAY FOR ALL HE'S PUT HIS OWN MONEY INTO THE GROUND BEFOREHAND SEE
BETHELL WILL DO THAT REGULARLY WITH THE CART AND PONY OH SIR BEGGING YOUR PARDON I'VE NEVER BEEN USED T HAVING GENTLEFOLKS'S SERVANTS COMING ABOUT MY BACK PLACES A MAKING LOVE TO BOTH THE GELLS AT ONCE
AFTER YOU HAD GIVEN THAT BLOW TO ARTHUR IN THE GROVE ADAM WAS SILENT THE LAST WORDS HAD CALLED UP A VIVID IMAGE OF THE PAST AND MISTER IRWINE LEFT HIM TO HIS THOUGHTS
THOUGH THERE'S SOME ON IT AS ONE'S NO NEED TO SEE THE SMELL'S ENOUGH
BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
FOR YOUR NAME'S NO BETTER THAN A BRIMSTONE MATCH IN EVERYBODY'S NOSE IF IT ISNA TWO THREE OLD FOLKS AS YOU THINK O SAVING YOUR SOUL BY GIVING EM A BIT O FLANNEL AND A DROP O PORRIDGE AN YOU MAY BE RIGHT THINKING IT'LL TAKE BUT LITTLE TO SAVE YOUR SOUL

THE SPEECHES HAD ALWAYS REMAINED IMAGINARY GOOD DAY MISSUS POYSER SAID THE OLD SQUIRE PEERING AT HER WITH HIS SHORT SIGHTED EYES A MODE OF LOOKING AT HER WHICH AS MISSUS POYSER OBSERVED ALLAYS AGGRAVATED ME
THERE ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH TWO SERVANT GIRLS AND A WAGGONER MAY BE A FORMIDABLE AUDIENCE AND AS THE SQUIRE RODE AWAY ON HIS BLACK PONY EVEN THE GIFT OF SHORT SIGHTEDNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING AWARE THAT MOLLY
I THINK FOLKS HAVE TO WAIT LONG ENOUGH AFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO EM THE FACT IS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE IGNORING MISSUS POYSER'S THEORY OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY
AND WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CAUSEWAY WHEN HIS MASTER BECKONED YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR AND YOU MAY GO SPINNIN UNDERHAND WAYS O DOING US A MISCHIEF FOR YOU'VE GOT OLD HARRY TO YOUR FRIEND THOUGH NOBODY ELSE IS
WITH TWO BEDS IN IT ONE LAID ON THE FLOOR IT IS TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE DARK WALL OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SHUTS OUT THE MOONLIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DIP CANDLE BY WHICH BARTLE MASSEY IS PRETENDING TO READ
HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
TO SIN AND MISERY I'M NOT DECEIVING YOU ADAM SAID MISTER IRWINE ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS NOT COME BACK WAS NOT COME BACK WHEN I LEFT I HAVE LEFT A LETTER FOR HIM HE WILL KNOW
I'LL SIT DOWN IN YOUR COMFORTABLE KITCHEN AH POYSER HOW DO YOU DO IN THE MIDST OF BUSINESS I SEE AS USUAL I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOUR WIFE'S BEAUTIFUL DAIRY
THAN CORN LAND MISTER POYSER WAS LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS MOUTH SCREWED UP
ALL HIS LIFE WHY DO YOU CRAVE VENGEANCE IN THIS WAY NO AMOUNT OF TORTURE THAT YOU COULD INFLICT ON HIM COULD BENEFIT HER NO O GOD NO ADAM GROANED OUT SINKING ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR
AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
COULD A CLEAN MINDED MAN IMAGINE SUCH DEPRAVITY EVIDENTLY NOT HE DREW A FREE BREATH THAT WAS THE ATTITUDE TO TAKE IT WAS DIGNIFIED ENOUGH IT GAVE HIM THE ADVANTAGE
SOMETHING UNKNOWN WITHERING AND POISONOUS HAD ENTERED HIS LIFE PASSED NEAR HIM TOUCHED HIM AND HE WAS DETERIORATING HE WAS APPALLED WHAT WAS IT SHE WAS GONE WHY
FOREIGNERS DO THEY ALSO KILL SOMETIMES IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AND TO HIS HORROR HE FELT HIMSELF DRIVEN TO REGRET ALMOST THAT THE USAGES OF A SOCIETY READY TO FORGIVE THE SHOOTING OF A BURGLAR FORBADE HIM
DIGNITY DISGUST OR FORESIGHT WOULD RESOLUTELY IGNORE EACH OTHER AND THEIR EYES QUICK OR SLOW THEIR EYES GAZING UP THE DUSTY STEPS THEIR EYES BROWN BLACK GRAY BLUE HAD ALL THE SAME STARE
AND WAS MOVED SO DEEPLY BY THE OPPRESSIVE SORROW THAT ANOTHER TURN OF THE SCREW HE FELT WOULD BRING TEARS OUT OF HIS EYES HE WAS DETERIORATING FIVE YEARS OF LIFE IN COMMON HAD APPEASED HIS LONGING YES LONG TIME AGO
HE THREW IT UP AND PUT HIS HEAD OUT A CHILL GUST OF WIND WANDERING THROUGH THE DAMP AND SOOTY OBSCURITY OVER THE WASTE OF ROOFS AND CHIMNEY POTS TOUCHED HIS FACE WITH A CLAMMY FLICK HE SAW AN ILLIMITABLE DARKNESS
ALL HIS ACQUAINTANCES HAD SAID HE WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE AND HE HAD SAID SO HIMSELF FRANKLY BECAUSE IT IS VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERY MAN FALLS IN LOVE ONCE IN HIS LIFE UNLESS HIS WIFE DIES WHEN IT MAY BE QUITE PRAISEWORTHY TO FALL IN LOVE AGAIN
HE WAS SURPRISED BY THE NUMBER OF DETAILS THAT INTRUDED UPON HIS UNWILLING MEMORY HE COULD NOT HELP REMEMBERING HER FOOTSTEPS THE RUSTLE OF HER DRESS HER WAY OF HOLDING HER HEAD HER DECISIVE MANNER OF SAYING ALVAN
THIS FIT OF HOT ANGER WAS SUCCEEDED BY A SUDDEN SADNESS BY THE DARKENING PASSAGE OF A THOUGHT THAT RAN OVER THE SCORCHED SURFACE OF HIS HEART LIKE UPON A BARREN PLAIN
IT HAD LAID ITS UNCLEAN HAND UPON THE SPOTLESS DRAPERIES OF HIS EXISTENCE AND HE HAD TO FACE IT ALONE WITH ALL THE WORLD LOOKING ON ALL THE WORLD AND HE THOUGHT THAT EVEN
AND HE PICTURED TO HIMSELF ALL THE PEOPLE HE KNEW ENGAGED IN SPECULATING AS TO WHETHER ALL THAT TIME HE HAD BEEN BLIND FOOLISH OR INFATUATED WHAT A WOMAN BLIND NOT AT ALL
WHO WOULD LISTEN ONE HAD SIMPLY TO BE WITHOUT STAIN AND WITHOUT REPROACH TO KEEP ONE'S PLACE IN THE FOREFRONT OF LIFE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL IN THAT HE SAID NO NO TEA AND WENT UPSTAIRS HE ASCENDED WITHOUT FOOTFALLS BRASS RODS GLIMMERED ALL UP THE RED CARPET ON THE FIRST FLOOR LANDING A MARBLE WOMAN
WHILE FLOATING UP TO HIS EARS THERE CAME A SOUND VAST AND FAINT THE DEEP MUTTER OF SOMETHING IMMENSE AND ALIVE IT PENETRATED HIM WITH A FEELING OF DISMAY AND HE GASPED SILENTLY
FROM THIS INTELLECTUAL CONNECTION SHE RECEIVED HER MIXED AND DECOROUS GUESTS WITH A KIND OF TALL PONDEROUS GRACE
FROM FAMILIARITY OR CONFIDENCES FROM SOMETHING SUSPECTED AND CONCEALED LIKE TRUTH OR PESTILENCE ALVAN HERVEY HESITATED STANDING ALONE IN THE DOORWAY FOR A MOMENT THEN DECIDED TO WALK HOME
AND TALKED FOR HOURS WITH A THICK LIPPED SMILE HE SAID NOTHING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED OBJECTIONABLE AND NOT QUITE THE THING TALKED IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER NOT OBVIOUSLY IRRITATINGLY HIS FOREHEAD WAS TOO LOFTY UNUSUALLY SO
ORIGINAL OR STARTLING NOTHING UNFORESEEN AND NOTHING IMPROPER HE MOVED FOR A TIME AIMLESSLY IN THAT GOOD COMPANY HUMMING A POPULAR BUT REFINED TUNE AND THINKING VAGUELY OF A BUSINESS LETTER FROM ABROAD
WELL CONNECTED WELL EDUCATED AND INTELLIGENT WHO DOESN'T BUT HIS CONNECTIONS EDUCATION AND INTELLIGENCE WERE STRICTLY ON A PAR WITH THOSE OF THE MEN WITH WHOM HE DID BUSINESS OR AMUSED HIMSELF HE HAD MARRIED FIVE YEARS AGO AT THE TIME
HE FELT VERY SICK PHYSICALLY SICK AS THOUGH HE HAD BITTEN THROUGH SOMETHING NAUSEOUS LIFE THAT TO A WELL ORDERED MIND SHOULD BE A MATTER OF CONGRATULATION
WHICH RADIATED PAIN ONLY ON EVERY SIDE PAIN WHAT KIND OF PAIN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO BE HEART BROKEN BUT IN AN EXCEEDINGLY SHORT MOMENT
LIKE A MAN INFORMED OF A DEADLY SECRET THE SECRET OF A CALAMITY THREATENING THE SAFETY OF MANKIND THE SACREDNESS
A SENTIMENT A PRINCIPLE OR A BELIEF OTHERWISE THAN IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DIGNITY OF THEIR OWN GLORIFICATION OF THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE THEY SKIMMED OVER THE SURFACE OF LIFE HAND IN HAND IN A PURE AND FROSTY ATMOSPHERE
HER INDIVIDUALITY OF WHICH SHE WAS VERY CONSCIOUS HAD NO PLAY SHE STRODE LIKE A GRENADIER WAS STRONG AND UPRIGHT LIKE AN OBELISK HAD A BEAUTIFUL FACE A CANDID BROW PURE EYES
AND THE INDELICATE ASPECT OF HIS DOMESTIC MISFORTUNE STRUCK HIM WITH SUCH SHAME THAT NEXT MOMENT
IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF A BEAT TO TURN ONE'S HEART INTO A HANDFUL OF DUST THE CONTAMINATION OF HER CRIME SPREAD OUT TAINTED THE UNIVERSE TAINTED HIMSELF WOKE UP ALL THE DORMANT INFAMIES OF THE WORLD
THE CHARMING LEGEND OF A HEARTLESS COUNTRY OF A PROMISED LAND ALL FLOWERS AND BLESSINGS HE CAME TO HIMSELF WITH A SLIGHT START
A GREAT AIMLESS UPROAR THAT IN A MANNER PREVENTED HIM FROM HEARING HIMSELF THINK AND MADE HIS MIND AN ABSOLUTE BLANK THIS ABSURD AND DISTRACTING TUMULT SEEMED TO OOZE OUT OF THE WRITTEN WORDS
AND IN THAT UNION FIND OUR GREATEST PEACE PHILOSOPHY WITH ITS PASSION FOR UNITY AND MYSTICISM WITH ITS MONOIDEISTIC BENT BOTH PASS TO THE LIMIT
WHAT I NOW SAY SUFFICIENTLY INDICATES TO THE PHILOSOPHIC READER THE PLACE WHERE I BELONG IF ASKED JUST WHERE THE DIFFERENCES IN FACT WHICH ARE DUE TO GOD'S EXISTENCE COME IN I SHOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT IN GENERAL
WORD CAME THAT THEY WERE IN DIRECT RANGE OF THE GUNS AT THE FORT AND ONCE MORE THE ADMIRAL SIGNALED STEAM AHEAD STILL LATER WORD CAME THAT THEY WERE ENTERING THE MOST DANGEROUS MINE INFESTED DISTRICT OF ALL
THESE PEARLS OF THE FAR EAST ARE SAID BY GEOLOGISTS TO BE THE RESULT OF GREAT VOLCANIC FORCES THAT TORE THEM AWAY FROM THE CONTINENT AND SET THEM OUT SIX HUNDRED MILES AS GEMS IN THE OCEAN
HE INSISTED ON HAVING DOORS AND WINDOWS CLOSED AND BLINDS ALL DOWN MISTER STUNTZ SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE MAN WANTED
I WANT TO KNOW IF IT IS SAFE IT WAS WITH A HEART THRILLING WITH PRIDE THAT THIS GREAT AMERICAN TOOK THE YOUNG MAN TO THE WINDOW AND AS HE OPENED THE BLIND AND THE WINDOW ITSELF
ORIGINALITY CANNOT BE EXPECTED IN A FIELD LIKE THIS WHERE ALL THE ATTITUDES AND TEMPERS THAT ARE POSSIBLE HAVE BEEN EXHIBITED IN LITERATURE LONG AGO AND WHERE ANY NEW WRITER CAN IMMEDIATELY BE CLASSED UNDER A FAMILIAR HEAD
IS NOT A WORLD OF FACTS BUT ONLY OF THE MEANING OF FACTS IT IS A POINT OF VIEW FOR JUDGING FACTS IT APPERTAINS TO A DIFFERENT OLOGY
BEYOND EACH MAN AND IN A FASHION CONTINUOUS WITH HIM THERE EXISTS A LARGER POWER WHICH IS FRIENDLY TO HIM AND TO HIS IDEALS ALL THAT THE FACTS REQUIRE IS
BOTH OF THEM SO VAGUE YET BOTH OF THEM NOBLE I KNOW NOT HOW TO DECIDE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS EMINENTLY A CASE FOR FACTS TO TESTIFY FACTS I THINK ARE YET LACKING TO PROVE SPIRIT RETURN
THAT THE POWER SHOULD BE BOTH OTHER AND LARGER THAN OUR CONSCIOUS SELVES ANYTHING LARGER WILL DO IF ONLY IT BE LARGE ENOUGH TO TRUST FOR THE NEXT STEP IT NEED NOT BE INFINITE IT NEED NOT BE SOLITARY
BUT AS I APPREHEND THE BUDDHISTIC DOCTRINE OF KARMA I AGREE IN PRINCIPLE WITH THAT ALL SUPERNATURALISTS ADMIT THAT FACTS ARE UNDER THE JUDGMENT OF HIGHER LAW
OF ALL THE ISLANDS IN THE EASTERN SEAS NONE ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN OUR OWN PHILIPPINES LIKE THE GENUINE PEARL WHICH IS THE RESULT OF A BRUISE AND THE OUTCOME OF SUFFERING
COULD SEE EACH INDIVIDUAL COMPANY ALTHOUGH THEY WERE HIDDEN FROM EACH OTHER THE GREAT BODY OF MEN MOVED LIKE THE WHEELS OF A GREAT CLOCK THEY STOOD KNELT TOUCHED HANDS LAY DOWN AROSE WALKED AND EXERCISED
THE RESULT WAS QUITE TO THE CONTRARY ONCE MORE IDEALISM HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE MOVING FORCE IN WORKING OUT THE DESTINIES OF NATIONS THAT IS WHAT AMERICA HAS DONE TO THE PHILIPPINES
AND IN THE TOWER AT THE CENTER WATCHMEN WHO CAN SEE THE ENTIRE PRISON STAND NIGHT AND DAY THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF THE OFFICIALS THE WRITER WAS ALLOWED TO GO INTO THIS TOWER ONE AFTERNOON
HAVE BEEN WONT TO BE AND CAN SUFFER THE NOTION OF THIS WORLD BEING PARTLY SAVED AND PARTLY LOST THE ORDINARY MORALISTIC STATE OF MIND MAKES THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD CONDITIONAL UPON THE SUCCESS WITH WHICH EACH UNIT DOES ITS PART
HE IS ASSUMED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO BE ONE AND ONLY AND TO BE INFINITE
PARTIAL AND CONDITIONAL SALVATION IS IN FACT A MOST FAMILIAR NOTION WHEN TAKEN IN THE ABSTRACT THE ONLY DIFFICULTY BEING TO DETERMINE THE DETAILS
WE HAVE THE ELEMENTS OF A THEORY TO WHICH THE PHENOMENA OF RELIGIOUS LIFE LEND PLAUSIBILITY I AM SO IMPRESSED BY THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE PHENOMENA THAT I ADOPT THE HYPOTHESIS WHICH THEY SO NATURALLY SUGGEST
AND PRESERVING THE PEACE IN GENERAL THIS FORCE IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE MOUNTED POLICE SYSTEM OF SASKATCHEWAN IN CANADA AND IS A TERROR TO EVIL DOERS
KEEPING TIME WITH THE MUSIC IN A WAY THAT WAS WONDERFUL TO BEHOLD CELLS FOR PRISONERS HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN DONE AWAY THEY MINGLE IN COMPANIES IN LARGE SUNNY CLEAN DORMITORIES WHERE THEY VISIT READ AND SING
YOU MAY TAKE THE BIBLE AND CLIMB UP ON THE RIDGEBOARD OF YOUR HOUSE AT HIGH NOON EACH DAY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS IN THE YEAR AND READ IT AS LOUD AS YOU CAN AND NO MAN SHALL HARM YOU
AND PRESENTED DESTROYERS AND A SUBMARINE TO THE UNITED STATES NAVY IT OVERSUBSCRIBED ITS QUOTA IN LIBERTY BONDS AND GAVE GENEROUSLY TO RED CROSS AND OTHER WAR WORK
COVERS HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF GROUND THE GREAT Y M C A BUILDINGS WERE THRONGED AS IN NO OTHER CITY THE WRITER EVER VISITED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS UP TO DATE THE POLICE SYSTEM WELL ORGANIZED
AND WERE LIABLE ANY INSTANT TO BE BLOWN TO ATOMS AND ONCE MORE THE FEARLESS ADMIRAL SIGNALED STEAM AHEAD THE RESULT WAS THAT THE LONG DARK NIGHT OF SPANISH RULE WAS ENDED
I VISITED THE PHILIPPINES A SHORT TIME BEFORE THE WORLD WAR BROKE OUT AND AT THAT TIME THERE WERE SEVEN MILLION ACRES OF ARABLE LAND UNOCCUPIED
AND NEW DEPARTURES ARE MADE HERE BELOW SUBJECTS ME TO BEING CLASSED AMONG THE SUPERNATURALISTS OF THE PIECEMEAL OR CRASSER TYPE UNIVERSALISTIC SUPERNATURALISM SURRENDERS IT SEEMS TO ME
AND HAD BEEN MODERATELY FORTUNATE IN THE NUMBER OF THE LOT HE MIGHT AS THE MESSENGER REPORTED BE HAPPY HERE AND ALSO HIS JOURNEY TO ANOTHER LIFE AND RETURN TO THIS INSTEAD OF BEING ROUGH AND UNDERGROUND WOULD BE SMOOTH AND HEAVENLY MOST CURIOUS HE SAID WAS THE SPECTACLE
MOST OF WHOM WERE TYRANTS AND THERE WERE ALSO BESIDES THE TYRANTS PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN GREAT CRIMINALS
OF THIS THEY WERE ALL OBLIGED TO DRINK A CERTAIN QUANTITY AND THOSE WHO WERE NOT SAVED BY WISDOM DRANK MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY AND EACH ONE AS HE DRANK FORGOT ALL THINGS NOW AFTER THEY HAD GONE TO REST ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THERE WAS A THUNDERSTORM AND EARTHQUAKE
NOW THE WHORL IS IN FORM LIKE THE WHORL USED ON EARTH AND THE DESCRIPTION OF IT IMPLIED THAT THERE IS ONE LARGE HOLLOW WHORL WHICH IS QUITE SCOOPED OUT AND INTO THIS IS FITTED ANOTHER LESSER ONE AND ANOTHER
NOT ONLY IN THIS LIFE BUT IN ALL THAT WHICH IS TO COME FOR THIS IS THE WAY OF HAPPINESS AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE MESSENGER FROM THE OTHER WORLD THIS WAS WHAT THE PROPHET SAID AT THE TIME EVEN FOR THE LAST COMER IF HE CHOOSES WISELY AND WILL LIVE DILIGENTLY
I HAVE HAD THE SATISFACTION OF HAVING MANY WHO ONCE CONDEMNED ME THANK ME HEARTILY FOR MY FRANK WORDS THE CHANGE OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE NEGRO MINISTRY SO FAR AS REGARDS MYSELF IS SO COMPLETE THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME I HAVE NO WARMER FRIENDS AMONG ANY CLASS THAN I HAVE AMONG THE CLERGYMEN
BUT I MUST ALSO MENTION THAT THERE WERE ANIMALS TAME AND WILD WHO CHANGED INTO ONE ANOTHER AND INTO CORRESPONDING HUMAN NATURES THE GOOD INTO THE GENTLE AND THE EVIL INTO THE SAVAGE IN ALL SORTS OF COMBINATIONS ALL THE SOULS HAD NOW CHOSEN THEIR LIVES
SAD AND LAUGHABLE AND STRANGE FOR THE CHOICE OF THE SOULS WAS IN MOST CASES BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OF A PREVIOUS LIFE THERE HE SAW THE SOUL WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN ORPHEUS CHOOSING THE LIFE OF A SWAN OUT OF ENMITY TO THE RACE OF WOMEN
AS SOON AS I WAS RECOGNIZED I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND MYSELF POINTED OUT AND SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF MEN WHO WISHED TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME
AND WHEN THEY HAD ALL PASSED THEY MARCHED ON IN A SCORCHING HEAT TO THE PLAIN OF FORGETFULNESS WHICH WAS A BARREN WASTE DESTITUTE OF TREES AND VERDURE AND THEN TOWARDS EVENING THEY ENCAMPED BY THE RIVER OF UNMINDFULNESS WHOSE WATER NO VESSEL CAN HOLD
WILL NOT COME IN ANY LARGE DEGREE THROUGH OUTSIDE OR ARTIFICIAL FORCING BUT WILL BE ACCORDED TO THE NEGRO BY THE SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
I BUT CONVEY TO YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND DIRECTORS THE SENTIMENT OF THE MASSES OF MY RACE WHEN I SAY THAT IN NO WAY HAVE THE VALUE AND MANHOOD OF THE AMERICAN NEGRO BEEN MORE FITTINGLY AND GENEROUSLY RECOGNIZED
TELEGRAPHED TO A NEW YORK PAPER AMONG OTHER WORDS THE FOLLOWING I DO NOT EXAGGERATE WHEN I SAY THAT PROFESSOR BOOKER T WASHINGTON'S ADDRESS YESTERDAY WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE SPEECHES BOTH AS TO CHARACTER AND AS TO THE WARMTH OF ITS RECEPTION EVER DELIVERED TO A SOUTHERN AUDIENCE
AND DID NOT AT FIRST SIGHT PERCEIVE THAT HE WAS FATED AMONG OTHER EVILS TO DEVOUR HIS OWN CHILDREN BUT WHEN HE HAD TIME TO REFLECT AND SAW WHAT WAS IN THE LOT HE BEGAN TO BEAT HIS BREAST AND LAMENT OVER HIS CHOICE FORGETTING THE PROCLAMATION OF THE PROPHET
THE SIXTH IS NEXT TO THE FIRST IN SIZE THE FOURTH NEXT TO THE SIXTH THEN COMES THE EIGHTH THE SEVENTH IS FIFTH THE FIFTH IS SIXTH THE THIRD IS SEVENTH LAST AND EIGHTH COMES THE SECOND THE LARGEST OR FIXED STARS IS SPANGLED AND THE SEVENTH
AND GOOD TO THE LIFE WHICH WILL MAKE HIS SOUL MORE JUST ALL ELSE HE WILL DISREGARD
STATUARY CARVING PAINTINGS THE MANAGEMENT OF DRUG STORES AND BANKS HAS NOT BEEN TRODDEN WITHOUT CONTACT WITH THORNS AND THISTLES WHILE WE TAKE PRIDE IN WHAT WE EXHIBIT AS A RESULT OF OUR INDEPENDENT EFFORTS WE DO NOT FOR A MOMENT FORGET THAT OUR PART IN THIS EXHIBITION WOULD FALL FAR SHORT OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS
ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER HE SAID THAT THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD SEE FROM ABOVE A LINE OF LIGHT STRAIGHT AS A COLUMN
AND THEY WENT IN THE ORDER OF THEIR CHOICE TO LACHESIS WHO SENT WITH THEM THE GENIUS WHOM THEY HAD SEVERALLY CHOSEN TO BE THE GUARDIAN OF THEIR LIVES AND THE FULFILLER OF THE CHOICE THIS GENIUS LED THE SOULS FIRST TO CLOTHO AND DREW THEM WITHIN THE REVOLUTION OF THE SPINDLE IMPELLED BY HER HAND
THERE IS NO DEFENCE OR SECURITY FOR ANY OF US EXCEPT IN THE HIGHEST INTELLIGENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALL IF ANYWHERE THERE ARE EFFORTS TENDING TO CURTAIL THE FULLEST GROWTH OF THE NEGRO LET THESE EFFORTS BE TURNED INTO STIMULATING ENCOURAGING AND MAKING HIM THE MOST USEFUL AND INTELLIGENT CITIZEN
ALTHOUGH I HAVE NEVER BEFORE SAID SO IN SO MANY WORDS THAT THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THE NEGRO IN THE SOUTH WILL BE ACCORDED ALL THE POLITICAL RIGHTS WHICH HIS ABILITY CHARACTER AND MATERIAL POSSESSIONS ENTITLE HIM TO I THINK THOUGH THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO FREELY EXERCISE SUCH POLITICAL RIGHTS
THEY MARRY WHOM THEY LIKE AND GIVE IN MARRIAGE TO WHOM THEY WILL ALL THAT YOU SAID OF THE OTHERS I NOW SAY OF THESE AND ON THE OTHER HAND OF THE UNJUST I SAY THAT THE GREATER NUMBER
THE BOARD OF JURORS WAS A LARGE ONE CONTAINING IN ALL OF SIXTY MEMBERS IT WAS ABOUT EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE AND NORTHERN WHITE PEOPLE AMONG THEM WERE COLLEGE PRESIDENTS LEADING SCIENTISTS AND MEN OF LETTERS AND SPECIALISTS IN MANY SUBJECTS
FOR WE HAVE SEEN AND KNOW THAT THIS IS THE BEST CHOICE BOTH IN LIFE AND AFTER DEATH A MAN MUST TAKE WITH HIM INTO THE WORLD BELOW AN ADAMANTINE FAITH IN TRUTH AND RIGHT THAT THERE TOO HE MAY BE UNDAZZLED BY THE DESIRE OF WEALTH OR THE OTHER ALLUREMENTS OF EVIL
BUT AFTER THE FIRST BURST OF ENTHUSIASM BEGAN TO DIE AWAY AND THE COLOURED PEOPLE BEGAN READING THE SPEECH IN COLD TYPE SOME OF THEM SEEMED TO FEEL THAT THEY HAD BEEN HYPNOTIZED THEY SEEMED TO FEEL THAT I HAD BEEN TOO LIBERAL IN MY REMARKS TOWARD THE SOUTHERN WHITES
CLOTHO FROM TIME TO TIME
AND WE SHALL PASS SAFELY OVER THE RIVER OF FORGETFULNESS AND OUR SOUL WILL NOT BE DEFILED WHEREFORE MY COUNSEL IS THAT WE HOLD FAST EVER TO THE HEAVENLY WAY AND FOLLOW AFTER JUSTICE AND VIRTUE ALWAYS
SOME DAYS AFTER ITS DELIVERY I SENT A COPY OF MY ADDRESS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE HON GROVER CLEVELAND I RECEIVED FROM HIM THE FOLLOWING AUTOGRAPH REPLY
AS WE HAVE PROVED OUR LOYALTY TO YOU IN THE PAST NURSING YOUR CHILDREN WATCHING BY THE SICK BED OF YOUR MOTHERS AND FATHERS
AND WHEN THERE WAS SILENCE ONE BY ONE THEY ASCENDED WITH EXCEEDING JOY THESE SAID ER WERE THE PENALTIES AND RETRIBUTIONS AND THERE WERE BLESSINGS AS GREAT
I WROTE THE LETTER GIVING THE EXACT FACTS AS I CONCEIVED THEM TO BE THE PICTURE PAINTED WAS A RATHER BLACK ONE OR SINCE I AM BLACK SHALL I SAY WHITE IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE WITH A RACE BUT A FEW YEARS OUT OF SLAVERY A RACE WHICH HAD NOT HAD TIME OR OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE A COMPETENT MINISTRY
AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE CAR WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A DORMITORY THE BACKS OF THE SEATS WERE THROWN BACK BEDSTEADS CAREFULLY PACKED
THE CENTRAL PACIFIC TAKING SACRAMENTO FOR ITS STARTING POINT EXTENDS EASTWARD TO MEET THE ROAD FROM OMAHA THE LINE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SACRAMENTO RUNS IN A NORTH EASTERLY DIRECTION ALONG THE AMERICAN RIVER
THE TRAVELLERS GAZED ON THIS CURIOUS SPECTACLE FROM THE PLATFORMS BUT PHILEAS FOGG WHO HAD THE MOST REASON OF ALL TO BE IN A HURRY REMAINED IN HIS SEAT AND WAITED PHILOSOPHICALLY UNTIL IT SHOULD PLEASE THE BUFFALOES TO GET OUT OF THE WAY
AND HE SOMETIMES RETURNED TO LONGBOURN ONLY IN TIME TO MAKE AN APOLOGY FOR HIS ABSENCE BEFORE THE FAMILY WENT TO BED MISSUS BENNET WAS REALLY IN A MOST PITIABLE STATE
MISTER COLLINS RETURNED MOST PUNCTUALLY ON MONDAY FORTNIGHT BUT HIS RECEPTION AT LONGBOURN WAS NOT QUITE SO GRACIOUS AS IT HAD BEEN ON HIS FIRST INTRODUCTION HE WAS TOO HAPPY HOWEVER TO NEED MUCH ATTENTION
BUT HE DID NOT TALK TO HIM AFTER RECENT EVENTS THEIR RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER HAD GROWN SOMEWHAT COLD THERE COULD NO LONGER BE MUTUAL SYMPATHY OR INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM
IT WAS ALREADY NIGHT COLD AND CHEERLESS THE HEAVENS BEING OVERCAST WITH CLOUDS WHICH SEEMED TO THREATEN SNOW THE TRAIN DID NOT PROCEED RAPIDLY COUNTING THE STOPPAGES IT DID NOT RUN MORE THAN TWENTY MILES AN HOUR
BUT SIR WILLIAM'S GOOD BREEDING CARRIED HIM THROUGH IT ALL AND THOUGH HE BEGGED LEAVE TO BE POSITIVE AS TO THE TRUTH OF HIS INFORMATION HE LISTENED TO ALL THEIR IMPERTINENCE WITH THE MOST FORBEARING COURTESY ELIZABETH
FOR IT GRATIFIED HIM HE SAID TO DISCOVER THAT CHARLOTTE LUCAS WHOM HE HAD BEEN USED TO THINK TOLERABLY SENSIBLE WAS AS FOOLISH AS HIS WIFE AND MORE FOOLISH THAN HIS DAUGHTER
THE MORMON CAPITAL PLUNGES INTO THE TUILLA VALLEY ACROSS THE AMERICAN DESERT CEDAR AND HUMBOLDT MOUNTAINS THE SIERRA NEVADA AND DESCENDS VIA SACRAMENTO TO THE PACIFIC
NOR WAS DARCY'S VINDICATION THOUGH GRATEFUL TO HER FEELINGS CAPABLE OF CONSOLING HER FOR SUCH DISCOVERY MOST EARNESTLY DID SHE LABOUR TO PROVE THE PROBABILITY OF ERROR
IF THEY CAN BE EASY WITH AN ESTATE THAT IS NOT LAWFULLY THEIR OWN SO MUCH THE BETTER
THAT HE HAD BEEN SO READY TO CLOSE WITH THEIR KIND WISH OF SEEING HIM AGAIN AT LONGBOURN WHITHER HE HOPED TO BE ABLE TO RETURN ON MONDAY FORTNIGHT FOR LADY CATHERINE HE ADDED SO HEARTILY APPROVED HIS MARRIAGE
BETWEEN OMAHA AND THE PACIFIC THE RAILWAY CROSSES A TERRITORY WHICH IS STILL INFESTED BY INDIANS AND WILD BEASTS AND A LARGE TRACT WHICH THE MORMONS AFTER THEY WERE DRIVEN FROM ILLINOIS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE BEGAN TO COLONISE
THE ENGINEER DID NOT TRY TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLE AND HE WAS WISE HE WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THE FIRST BUFFALOES NO DOUBT WITH THE COW CATCHER BUT THE LOCOMOTIVE HOWEVER POWERFUL WOULD SOON HAVE BEEN CHECKED
SHE PERSISTED IN DISBELIEVING THE WHOLE OF THE MATTER SECONDLY SHE WAS VERY SURE THAT MISTER COLLINS HAD BEEN TAKEN IN THIRDLY SHE TRUSTED THAT THEY WOULD NEVER BE HAPPY TOGETHER AND FOURTHLY
INSTEAD OF MAKING ANY ANSWER SHE WENT ON AS BEFORE I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE ALL THIS ESTATE IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE ENTAIL I SHOULD NOT MIND IT WHAT SHOULD NOT YOU MIND
AS BINGLEY HAD NOW BEEN GONE A WEEK AND NOTHING MORE WAS HEARD OF HIS RETURN JANE HAD SENT CAROLINE AN EARLY ANSWER TO HER LETTER AND WAS COUNTING THE DAYS TILL SHE MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO HEAR AGAIN
AND LONGED TO DISCHARGE HIS ARSENAL OF REVOLVERS UPON THEM WHAT A COUNTRY CRIED HE MERE CATTLE STOP THE TRAINS AND GO BY IN A PROCESSION JUST AS IF THEY WERE NOT IMPEDING TRAVEL PARBLEU
DO NOT GIVE WAY TO SUCH GLOOMY THOUGHTS LET US HOPE FOR BETTER THINGS LET US FLATTER OURSELVES THAT I MAY BE THE SURVIVOR THIS WAS NOT VERY CONSOLING TO MISSUS BENNET
AND THE OTHER THAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN BARBAROUSLY MISUSED BY THEM ALL AND ON THESE TWO POINTS SHE PRINCIPALLY DWELT DURING THE REST OF THE DAY NOTHING COULD CONSOLE AND NOTHING COULD APPEASE HER
ITS BROAD STREETS ITS NOBLE HOTELS SQUARES AND CHURCHES THE TRAIN ON LEAVING SACRAMENTO AND PASSING THE JUNCTION ROCLIN AUBURN AND COLFAX ENTERED THE RANGE OF THE SIERRA NEVADA
YES YES THEY WILL TAKE CARE NOT TO OUTRUN THEIR INCOME THEY WILL NEVER BE DISTRESSED FOR MONEY
AND THESE FOUR WORDS COMPOSE THE GENERAL DESIGNATION OF THE GREAT TRUNK LINE WHICH CROSSES THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE UNITED STATES THE PACIFIC RAILROAD IS HOWEVER REALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO DISTINCT LINES
NOR DID THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH IT WENT ON INJURIOUSLY AFFECT ITS GOOD EXECUTION THE ROAD GREW ON THE PRAIRIES A MILE AND A HALF A DAY A LOCOMOTIVE RUNNING ON THE RAILS LAID DOWN THE EVENING BEFORE
GOOD LORD SIR WILLIAM HOW CAN YOU TELL SUCH A STORY DO NOT YOU KNOW THAT MISTER COLLINS WANTS TO MARRY LIZZY NOTHING LESS THAN THE COMPLAISANCE OF A COURTIER COULD HAVE BORNE WITHOUT ANGER SUCH TREATMENT
HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN CHARLOTTE MADE HER TURN WITH FONDER REGARD TO HER SISTER OF WHOSE RECTITUDE AND DELICACY SHE WAS SURE HER OPINION COULD NEVER BE SHAKEN AND FOR WHOSE HAPPINESS SHE GREW DAILY MORE ANXIOUS
THE TRAVELLERS PASSED THROUGH SACRAMENTO SO THAT THEY SAW NOTHING OF THAT IMPORTANT PLACE
AND IF YOU WISH TO HELP ME GO WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY TO THE GREAT GALLERY NOTICE WHERE THE SUN'S RAYS FALL MOST BRIGHTLY AND IF YOU SEEK THERE YOU WILL FIND MY TREASURE THE VOICE CEASED AND THOUGH THE PRINCE IN HIS BEWILDERMENT ASKED VARIOUS QUESTIONS HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER
SHE INFORMED HER OF THE SECRET OF HER BIRTH IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT CONCEAL HER SEX THE GRANDMOTHER HOWEVER DYING THE SUPPORT FROM THAT QUARTER FAILED AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO HIRE HER OUT AS A FOOTBOY TO A FRENCH LADY THE STRENGTH AND MANLY DISPOSITION OF THIS SUPPOSED BOY
THE BUTLER AND SAID FAIR DAMSEL COME YE FROM SIR LAUNCELOT DU LAC YEA SIR SHE SAID I COME HITHER TO SPEAK WITH THE KING ALAS SAID SIR LUCAN MY LORD ARTHUR WOULD BE RECONCILED TO SIR LAUNCELOT BUT SIR GAWAIN WILL NOT SUFFER HIM
AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THOSE LANDS CAME TO SIR LAUNCELOT AND RECEIVED HIM HOME RIGHT JOYFULLY
THAN THAT OF HER OWN BUT SHE COULD NOT ENTERTAIN THE IDEA THAT HE COULD REFUSE TO FIGHT AND SO BE ESTEEMED A COWARD ACCORDINGLY SHE QUARRELLED WITH THE MAN WHO CHALLENGED HER LOVER AND CALLED HIM TO THE FIELD TWO HOURS BEFORE HIS APPOINTMENT WITH HER LOVER
HER BUSINESS DIMINISHED UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE AGAIN RESUMED HER MAN'S DRESS AND GOING INTO HOLLAND ENLISTED INTO A REGIMENT OF FOOT QUARTERED IN ONE OF THE FRONTIER TOWNS BUT THERE BEING NO PROSPECT OF PREFERMENT IN TIME OF PEACE
INCREASED WITH HER YEARS AND LEAVING THAT SERVILE EMPLOYMENT SHE ENGAGED ON BOARD A MAN OF WAR THE VOLATILE DISPOSITION OF THE YOUTH DID NOT PERMIT HER TO REMAIN LONG IN THIS STATION AND SHE NEXT WENT INTO FLANDERS AND JOINED A REGIMENT OF FOOT AS A CADET
AND MUCH PEOPLE DRAWETH UNTO HIM AS I HEAR SAY THAT MAY I BELIEVE SAID SIR GAWAIN BUT MY LORD SUMMON YOUR FRIENDS AND I WILL SUMMON MINE IT SHALL BE DONE SAID THE KING SO THEN THE KING SENT LETTERS AND WRITS THROUGHOUT ALL ENGLAND
FOR HE WAS VERY FOND OF READING AND HE SOON GOT PERMISSION TO HAVE AS MANY BOOKS AS HE LIKED
AND SAILED TO THE KINGDOM OF LOEGRIA AND IN DUE TIME ARRIVED SAFE AT CAMELOT WHERE THE KING WAS THEN WAS THERE GREAT JOY MADE OF HIM IN THE WHOLE COURT FOR THEY FEARED HE HAD BEEN DEAD THEN THE KING MADE GREAT CLERKS TO COME BEFORE HIM THAT THEY SHOULD CHRONICLE OF THE HIGH ADVENTURES OF THE GOOD KNIGHTS
THE PRINCE FOUND THAT IT PROCEEDED FROM AN IMMENSE GLOWING CARBUNCLE MADE INTO A BOX WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM HE LOST NO TIME IN OPENING IT BUT WHAT WAS HIS HORROR WHEN HE FOUND THAT IT CONTAINED A MAN'S HAND WHICH WAS HOLDING A PORTRAIT
LAWAYN WITH MANY MORE AND ALL WENT TO SIR LAUNCELOT AND THEY SAID MY LORD SIR LAUNCELOT WE PRAY YOU IF YOU WILL HAVE OUR SERVICE KEEP US NO LONGER WITHIN THESE WALLS FOR KNOW WELL ALL YOUR FAIR SPEECH AND FORBEARANCE WILL NOT AVAIL YOU
THUS A YEAR AND TWO MONTHS LIVED SIR PERCEVAL IN THE HERMITAGE A FULL HOLY LIFE AND THEN PASSED OUT OF THIS WORLD AND SIR BOHORT BURIED HIM BY HIS SISTER AND SIR GALAHAD THEN SIR BOHORT ARMED HIMSELF AND DEPARTED FROM SARRAS AND ENTERED INTO A SHIP
THEN SAID KING ARTHUR TO SIR GAWAIN I PRAY YOU MAKE YOU READY IN YOUR BEST ARMOR WITH YOUR BRETHREN SIR GAHERIS AND SIR GARETH TO BRING MY QUEEN TO THE FIRE THERE TO RECEIVE HER DEATH NAY MY MOST NOBLE LORD SAID SIR GAWAIN
THEN SIR BOHORT ENCOUNTERED WITH KING ARTHUR AND SMOTE HIM DOWN AND HE ALIGHTED AND DREW HIS SWORD AND SAID TO SIR LAUNCELOT SHALL I MAKE AN END OF THIS WAR
THE WALLS WERE OF TURQUOISES AND UPON A LOW COUCH LAY A LOVELY LADY WHO SEEMED TO BE ASLEEP HER HAIR BLACK AS EBONY WAS SPREAD ACROSS THE PILLOWS MAKING HER FACE LOOK IVORY WHITE AND THE PRINCE NOTICED THAT SHE WAS UNQUIET
THE ATTENTION OF OUR READERS IS NOW TO BE DIRECTED TO THE HISTORY OF TWO FEMALE PIRATES A HISTORY WHICH IS CHIEFLY REMARKABLE FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE SOFTER SEX ASSUMING A CHARACTER PECULIARLY DISTINGUISHED FOR EVERY VICE THAT CAN DISGRACE HUMANITY
THERE WAS A PICTURE OF A BALL AND THE PRINCE COULD WATCH THE LITTLE DANCING PEOPLE COME AND GO HE TURNED A PAGE AND THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT SMELL OF A SAVOURY DINNER AND ONE OF THE FIGURES WHO SAT AT THE FEAST LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID WE DRINK YOUR HEALTH CURLICUE
HE FOUND THAT THE PICTURES SEEMED TO BE SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF A MAN WHO APPEARED IN EVERY WINDOW AND THE PRINCE FANCYING THAT HE SAW IN THIS MAN SOME RESEMBLANCE TO HIMSELF BEGAN TO BE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE FIRST WINDOW THERE WAS A PICTURE OF HIM IN ONE OF THE TURRETS OF THE TOWER
BUT THE EAGLE UTTERING A DOLOROUS CRY FLUTTERED HIS BROAD WINGS AND DISAPPEARED THEN THE LADY TURNED TO PRINCE CURLICUE AND SAID
NOW SIR GAWAIN HAD THIS GIFT FROM A HOLY MAN THAT EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR FROM MORNING TO NOON HIS STRENGTH WAS INCREASED THREEFOLD AND THEN IT FELL AGAIN TO ITS NATURAL MEASURE SIR LAUNCELOT WAS AWARE OF THIS AND THEREFORE DURING THE THREE HOURS THAT SIR GAWAIN'S STRENGTH WAS AT THE HEIGHT
AND SIR LAUNCELOT CARRIED AWAY THE QUEEN TO HIS CASTLE OF LA JOYEUSE GARDE THEN THERE CAME ONE TO SIR GAWAIN AND TOLD HIM HOW THAT SIR LAUNCELOT HAD SLAIN THE KNIGHTS AND CARRIED AWAY THE QUEEN O LORD DEFEND MY BRETHREN
AND WHEN HE SOFTLY ADVANCED FEARING TO WAKE HER HE COULD HEAR HER SIGH AND MURMUR TO HERSELF AH HOW DARED YOU THINK TO WIN MY LOVE BY SEPARATING ME FROM MY BELOVED FLORIMOND
SO BY MEANS OF THIS BISHOP PEACE WAS MADE FOR THE SPACE OF ONE YEAR AND KING ARTHUR RECEIVED BACK THE QUEEN AND SIR LAUNCELOT DEPARTED FROM THE KINGDOM WITH ALL HIS KNIGHTS AND WENT TO HIS OWN COUNTRY SO THEY SHIPPED AT CARDIFF AND SAILED UNTO BENWICK WHICH SOME MEN CALL BAYONNE
AND WITH THIS SIR LUCAN LED THE DAMSEL TO THE KING WHERE HE SAT WITH SIR GAWAIN TO HEAR WHAT SHE WOULD SAY SO WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER TALE THE TEARS RAN OUT OF THE KING'S EYES AND ALL THE LORDS WERE FORWARD TO ADVISE THE KING TO BE ACCORDED WITH SIR LAUNCELOT SAVE ONLY SIR GAWAIN AND HE SAID
AND THIS TIME IT WAS A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG MAN POOR PRINCE CURLICUE FOUND IT A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT HIM HE WAS SO STRAIGHT AND STRONG BY THIS TIME IT HAD GROWN DARK AND THE PRINCE HAD TO GO BACK TO HIS OWN ROOM AND TO AMUSE HIMSELF HE TOOK UP A QUAINT OLD BOOK
HER MOTHER RESIDED IN THE COUNTRY FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS UNTIL HER MONEY WAS ALL SPENT AND HER INGENUITY WAS SET AT WORK TO CONTRIVE HOW TO OBTAIN A SUPPLY SHE KNEW THAT HER HUSBAND'S MOTHER WAS IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AND COULD EASILY SUPPORT HER CHILD
HER SON IN A SHORT TIME DIED AND SHE WAS RELIEVED FROM THE BURDEN OF HIS MAINTENANCE AND EDUCATION THE MOTHER HAD NOT RESIDED LONG IN THE COUNTRY BEFORE MARY READ THE SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT NARRATIVE WAS BORN AFTER THE BIRTH OF MARY
THAT SHE TOOK EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF ENJOYING HIS COMPANY AND CONVERSATION AND AFTER SHE HAD GAINED HIS FRIENDSHIP DISCOVERED HER SEX
THAT FIGHTING WOULD PROBABLY GO ON FOR A LONG TIME YET AND THAT THINGS BEING SO IT WAS QUITE LIKELY HE MIGHT BE IN COMMAND OF A REGIMENT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS TIME AS HE LOOKED AT THE MATTER IN THIS WAY
MY WIFE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF YOUR MOTHER'S WE ARE AT HOME ON THURSDAYS TODAY IS THURSDAY SO PLEASE COME AND SEE US QUITE INFORMALLY SAID THE GOVERNOR TAKING LEAVE OF HIM IMMEDIATELY ON LEAVING THE GOVERNOR'S NICHOLAS HIRED POST HORSES AND
IT IS NATURAL FOR US WHO WERE NOT LIVING IN THOSE DAYS TO IMAGINE THAT WHEN HALF RUSSIA HAD BEEN CONQUERED AND THE INHABITANTS WERE FLEEING TO DISTANT PROVINCES AND ONE LEVY AFTER ANOTHER WAS BEING RAISED FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE FATHERLAND
AND MY GOOD PEASANTS AND SO USE THE LAST RESOURCES OF MY EMPIRE IT STILL OFFERS ME MORE THAN MY ENEMIES SUPPOSE SAID THE EMPEROR GROWING MORE AND MORE ANIMATED BUT SHOULD IT EVER BE ORDAINED BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE HE CONTINUED
THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE FROM A BLIND AND DEPRAVED OLD MAN I ONLY WONDER THAT THE FATE OF RUSSIA COULD HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED TO SUCH A MAN AS LONG AS THIS NEWS REMAINED UNOFFICIAL IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DOUBT IT BUT THE NEXT DAY THE FOLLOWING COMMUNICATION WAS RECEIVED FROM COUNT ROSTOPCHIN
KUTUZOV WROTE THAT THE RUSSIANS HAD NOT RETREATED A STEP THAT THE FRENCH LOSSES WERE MUCH HEAVIER THAN OURS AND THAT HE WAS WRITING IN HASTE FROM THE FIELD OF BATTLE BEFORE COLLECTING FULL INFORMATION IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A VICTORY AND AT ONCE WITHOUT LEAVING THE CHURCH
WHEN HE HAD CHANGED POURED WATER OVER HIS HEAD AND SCENTED HIMSELF NICHOLAS ARRIVED AT THE GOVERNOR'S RATHER LATE BUT WITH THE PHRASE BETTER LATE THAN NEVER ON HIS LIPS IT WAS NOT A BALL NOR HAD DANCING BEEN ANNOUNCED
HAVE THEY SURRENDERED MY ANCIENT CAPITAL WITHOUT A BATTLE ASKED THE EMPEROR QUICKLY HIS FACE SUDDENLY FLUSHING MICHAUD RESPECTFULLY DELIVERED THE MESSAGE KUTUZOV HAD ENTRUSTED TO HIM WHICH WAS THAT IT HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGHT BEFORE MOSCOW
WHAT A WONDERFUL COINCIDENCE JUST DURING THE SERVICE BUT WHAT A LOSS KUTAYSOV IS HOW SORRY I AM WHAT DID I TELL ABOUT KUTUZOV PRINCE VASILI NOW SAID WITH A PROPHET'S PRIDE I ALWAYS SAID HE WAS THE ONLY MAN CAPABLE OF DEFEATING NAPOLEON
REMOUNTS FOR HIS DIVISION NOT ONLY WITHOUT REGRET AT BEING PREVENTED FROM TAKING PART IN THE COMING BATTLE BUT WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE WHICH HE DID NOT CONCEAL AND WHICH HIS COMRADES FULLY UNDERSTOOD A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO
HAD PRESCRIBED SMALL DOSES OF A CERTAIN DRUG TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN EFFECT BUT HELENE TORTURED BY THE FACT THAT THE OLD COUNT SUSPECTED HER AND THAT HER HUSBAND TO WHOM SHE HAD WRITTEN THAT WRETCHED PROFLIGATE PIERRE HAD NOT REPLIED
AND WHO OWNED SOME SPLENDID HORSES IN VERY FEW WORDS NICHOLAS BOUGHT SEVENTEEN PICKED STALLIONS FOR SIX THOUSAND RUBLES TO SERVE AS HE SAID AS SAMPLES OF HIS REMOUNTS AFTER DINING AND TAKING RATHER TOO MUCH OF THE HUNGARIAN WINE
AND HE TREATED HIM CORDIALLY THOUGH WITH DIGNITY AND RESTRAINT AS SOON AS NICHOLAS ENTERED IN HIS HUSSAR UNIFORM DIFFUSING AROUND HIM A FRAGRANCE OF PERFUME AND WINE AND HAD UTTERED THE WORDS BETTER LATE THAN NEVER AND HEARD THEM REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES BY OTHERS
WEPT FOR RUSSIA AND ITS ANCIENT CAPITAL AND TALKED OF SELF SACRIFICE AND SO ON BUT IN THE ARMY WHICH RETIRED BEYOND MOSCOW THERE WAS LITTLE TALK OR THOUGHT OF MOSCOW
AND THE DEATH OF HELENE ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER KUTUZOV'S REPORT A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN ARRIVED FROM MOSCOW AND NEWS OF THE SURRENDER OF MOSCOW TO THE FRENCH SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE TOWN THIS WAS TERRIBLE WHAT A POSITION FOR THE EMPEROR TO BE IN
THE EMPEROR SUDDENLY TURNED AWAY AS IF TO HIDE FROM MICHAUD THE TEARS THAT ROSE TO HIS EYES AND WENT TO THE FURTHER END OF HIS STUDY HAVING STOOD THERE A FEW MOMENTS HE STRODE BACK TO MICHAUD AND PRESSED HIS ARM BELOW THE ELBOW WITH A VIGOROUS MOVEMENT THE EMPEROR'S MILD AND HANDSOME FACE
EVERYTHING WENT WELL AND EASILY THE LANDOWNER TO WHOM NICHOLAS WENT WAS A BACHELOR AN OLD CAVALRYMAN A HORSE FANCIER A SPORTSMAN THE POSSESSOR OF SOME CENTURY OLD BRANDY AND SOME OLD HUNGARIAN WINE WHO HAD A SNUGGERY WHERE HE SMOKED
WITH THE NAIVE CONVICTION OF YOUNG MEN IN A MERRY MOOD THAT OTHER MEN'S WIVES WERE CREATED FOR THEM
AND WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF ITS BURNED RUINS NO ONE SWORE TO BE AVENGED ON THE FRENCH BUT THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR NEXT PAY THEIR NEXT QUARTERS OF MATRESHKA THE VIVANDIERE AND LIKE MATTERS AS THE WAR HAD CAUGHT HIM IN THE SERVICE
ALL RUSSIANS FROM THE GREATEST TO THE LEAST WERE SOLELY ENGAGED IN SACRIFICING THEMSELVES
HE SAW VILLAGES WITH PEASANTS AND PEASANT WOMEN GENTLEMEN'S COUNTRY HOUSES FIELDS WHERE CATTLE WERE GRAZING POSTHOUSES WITH STATIONMASTERS ASLEEP IN THEM HE REJOICED AS THOUGH SEEING ALL THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME
THEY ARE ONLY AFRAID LEST YOUR MAJESTY IN THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART SHOULD ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE PERSUADED TO MAKE PEACE THEY ARE BURNING FOR THE COMBAT DECLARED THIS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RUSSIAN NATION
ONLY UNCONSCIOUS ACTION BEARS FRUIT AND HE WHO PLAYS A PART IN AN HISTORIC EVENT NEVER UNDERSTANDS ITS SIGNIFICANCE IF HE TRIES TO REALIZE IT HIS EFFORTS ARE FRUITLESS
IT WAS LIKE A SUCCESSFULLY ARRANGED SURPRISE MENTION WAS MADE IN KUTUZOV'S REPORT OF THE RUSSIAN LOSSES
OR WEEPING OVER ITS DOWNFALL THE TALES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THAT TIME WITHOUT EXCEPTION SPEAK ONLY OF THE SELF SACRIFICE PATRIOTIC DEVOTION DESPAIR GRIEF AND THE HEROISM OF THE RUSSIANS BUT IT WAS NOT REALLY SO
AND AS IN EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON IN RUSSIA AT THAT TIME A SPECIAL RECKLESSNESS WAS NOTICEABLE AN IN FOR A PENNY IN FOR A POUND WHO CARES SPIRIT AND THE INEVITABLE SMALL TALK INSTEAD OF TURNING ON THE WEATHER AND MUTUAL ACQUAINTANCES
I HAVE RECEIVED NO COMMUNICATION FROM YOU YET ON THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER I RECEIVED FROM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF MOSCOW
HE HAD NEVER DANCED LIKE THAT IN MOSCOW AND WOULD EVEN HAVE CONSIDERED SUCH A VERY FREE AND EASY MANNER IMPROPER AND IN BAD FORM BUT HERE HE FELT IT INCUMBENT ON HIM TO ASTONISH THEM ALL BY SOMETHING UNUSUAL
WHO WELCOMED ROSTOV AS A NEAR RELATIVE AND CALLED HIM NICHOLAS
IT APPEARS THAT NOT VERY FAR FROM THE CASINO HE AND THE GIRL SAT DOWN IN THE DARKNESS UPON A PUBLIC BENCH THE LIGHTS FROM THAT PLACE OF ENTERTAINMENT MUST HAVE REACHED THEM THROUGH THE TREE TRUNKS SINCE EDWARD SAID
BEING ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE OTHER I HAD THOUGHT NOTHING I HAD SAID SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY THING I DON'T KNOW THAT ANALYSIS OF MY OWN PSYCHOLOGY MATTERS AT ALL TO THIS STORY I SHOULD SAY THAT IT DIDN'T OR AT ANY RATE
THAT THERE WAS OPPORTUNITY FOR ANOTHER REACTION MORE THAN ENOUGH HAD BEEN DONE FOR PHINEAS FINN IN ALLOWING HIM TO ELUDE THE GALLOWS THERE COULD CERTAINLY BE NO NEED FOR CROWNING HIM WITH A POLITICAL CHAPLET BECAUSE HE HAD NOT MURDERED MISTER BONTEEN
SHE HAD GONE OUT WITHOUT HER REMEDY AND HAVING FELT AN ATTACK COMING ON WHILST SHE WAS IN THE GARDENS SHE HAD RUN IN TO GET THE NITRATE IN ORDER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN RELIEF AND IT WAS EQUALLY INEVITABLE
AND VERY WISE MEN IN TANKERVILLE WERE MUCH SURPRISED WHEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT CANNOT RESIGN HIS SEAT THAT WHEN ONCE RETURNED HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE AS LONG AS THAT PARLIAMENT SHALL ENDURE
AS TO WHICH THE POLICE WERE SO BENIGNLY INEFFICIENT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE FOR THE WELFARE OF THE NATION THAT A GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE WHOSE PUBLIC LIFE HAD BEEN MARKED BY THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD ATTENDED MISTER FINN
THE PROPRIETOR OF THE HOTEL AT TIMES ONE HEAD WOULD BE THERE ALONE AT ANOTHER THE SPIKED HELMET OF THE OFFICIAL WOULD BE CLOSE TO THE HEALTHY BALDNESS OF THE PRINCE
HE LEANING SLIGHTLY TOWARDS HER AND SHE LOOKING STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE LIGHT OF THE CASINO HER FACE ILLUMINATED BY THE LAMPS THE EXPRESSION UPON HER FACE HE COULD ONLY DESCRIBE AS QUEER
THAT THE WHOLE MURDER HAD BEEN ARRANGED BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE TO BRING DOWN THE SCARLET WOMAN IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE SO FITTING A THING THAT PROVIDENCE SHOULD INTERFERE DIRECTLY TO PUNISH A TOWN
THAT AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL MOTIVE ABOUT HIS DECLARATION IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM TO BE A MATTER OF A DARK NIGHT AND A PROPINQUITY AND SO ON NO IT WAS SIMPLY OF HER EFFECT ON THE MORAL SIDE OF HIS LIFE
BUT WAS FOUND TO AGREE WITH THE DECISION OF THE PRIME MINISTER MISTER FINN WAS LEFT OUT IN THE COLD IN SPITE OF HIS GREAT FRIENDS AND THEN CAME THE MURDER OF MISTER BONTEEN CAN IT BE THAT MISTER FINN'S FITNESS FOR PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
NOT NITRATE OF AMYL BUT PRUSSIC ACID IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE WHY NOT EVEN EDWARD ASHBURNHAM WHO WAS AFTER ALL MORE INTIMATE WITH HER THAN I WAS HAD AN INKLING OF THE TRUTH HE JUST THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD DROPPED DEAD OF HEART DISEASE
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO EDWARD ASHBURNHAM HE ASSURED ME AND I SEE NO REASON FOR DISBELIEVING HIM THAT UNTIL THAT MOMENT HE HAD HAD NO IDEA WHATEVER OF CARING FOR THE GIRL
AS IT IS THE WHOLE OF MY RECOLLECTION OF THE SUCCEEDING THREE OR FOUR DAYS I WAS IN A STATE JUST SIMPLY CATALEPTIC THEY PUT ME TO BED AND I STAYED THERE THEY BROUGHT ME MY CLOTHES AND I DRESSED
WE MAY HOWEVER PROTEST AGAINST THE EMPLOYMENT OF AN UNFIT PERSON IN THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS NOT COMMITTED A MURDER
I PIECED IT TOGETHER AFTERWARDS YOU WILL REMEMBER I SAID THAT EDWARD ASHBURNHAM AND THE GIRL HAD GONE OFF THAT NIGHT TO A CONCERT AT THE CASINO AND THAT LEONORA HAD ASKED FLORENCE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR DEPARTURE TO FOLLOW THEM
NOT A THING STIRRED EXCEPT A COUPLE OF RABBITS ON THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE LAWN IT WAS LEONORA'S OWN LITTLE STUDY THAT WE WERE IN AND WE WERE WAITING FOR THE TEA TO BE BROUGHT I AS I SAID WAS SITTING IN THE DEEP CHAIR
THEN THEY ALL WENT AWAY AND I WAS LEFT ALONE FOR A LONG TIME AND I THOUGHT NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I HAD NO IDEAS I HAD NO STRENGTH I FELT NO SORROW NO DESIRE FOR ACTION
YOU ARE ALL THE CONSOLATION I HAVE IN THE WORLD AND ISN'T IT ODD TO THINK THAT IF YOUR WIFE HADN'T BEEN MY HUSBAND'S MISTRESS YOU WOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE BEEN HERE AT ALL THAT WAS HOW I GOT THE NEWS FULL IN THE FACE LIKE THAT
MISTER RUDDLES WAS AT ONCE DESPATCHED TO LONDON WITH TWO OTHER POLITICAL SPIRITS SO THAT THERE MIGHT BE A REAL DEPUTATION AND WAITED UPON PHINEAS TWO DAYS AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON
SHE HAD HER RECOMPENSE AT LAST BECAUSE OF COURSE IF YOU COME TO FIGURE IT OUT A SUDDEN POURING FORTH OF PASSION BY A MAN WHOM YOU REGARD AS A CROSS BETWEEN A PASTOR AND A FATHER MIGHT TO A WOMAN HAVE THE ASPECT
NITRATE OF AMYL YOU UNDERSTAND IS THE DRUG THAT IS GIVEN TO RELIEVE SUFFERERS FROM ANGINA PECTORIS SEEING FLORENCE AS I HAD SEEN HER RUNNING WITH A WHITE FACE AND WITH ONE HAND HELD OVER HER HEART
THE MOST LOVING FRIENDS OF MISTER BROWBOROUGH PERCEIVED AT ONCE THAT THERE WAS NOT A CHANCE FOR HIM THE BOROUGH WAS ALL BUT UNANIMOUS IN RESOLVING THAT IT WOULD RETURN NO ONE AS ITS MEMBER BUT THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY ACCUSED OF MURDER
WAS IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THAT PUBLIC SEAT IT WAS NOT A VERY DIFFICULT FEAT FOR A WOMAN INSTINCT WITH JEALOUSY THE CASINO ORCHESTRA WAS AS EDWARD REMEMBERED TO TELL ME PLAYING THE RAKOCSY MARCH
IF I HADN'T SAID TWO HOURS AFTER MY WIFE'S DEATH NOW I CAN MARRY THE GIRL SHE HAD THEN TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED THAT I HAD BEEN SUFFERING ALL THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUFFERING OR AT LEAST
SHE JUST SAT STILL AND LISTENED SMILING AND IT SEEMED TO HER THAT ALL THE BITTERNESS OF HER CHILDHOOD THE TERRORS OF HER TEMPESTUOUS FATHER THE BEWAILINGS OF HER CRUEL TONGUED MOTHER WERE SUDDENLY ATONED FOR
I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT I WAS EVEN ADDRESSED BY ONE OF THEM BUT AS LONG AS ONE OR THE OTHER OR ALL THREE OF THEM WERE THERE THEY STOOD BETWEEN ME AS IF I BEING THE TITULAR POSSESSOR OF THE CORPSE HAD A RIGHT TO BE PRESENT AT THEIR CONFERENCES
PARMITER HAD THROWN A NEW LIGHT UPON THE BUSINESS TONIGHT AND BY THE HELP OF THAT LIGHT I ARRAYED AFRESH MY SCANTY KNOWLEDGE THE STRANGENESS OF MY POSITION BESIDES KEPT ME IN SOME EXCITEMENT
HAD PERHAPS KEPT THE WORK FOR HIS OWN PERUSAL AND HER LADYSHIP WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER IF THE THING SHOULDN'T REAPPEAR FOR THE GRAND OCCASION APPOINTED BY OUR HOSTESS THE AUTHOR WOULDN'T HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO READ THAT WOULD DO JUST AS WELL
MY PRESENCE OCCASIONED HER NO SURPRISE AND THIS I THOUGHT WAS NO MORE THAN NATURAL AT THE MOMENT I TOOK MY ARM FROM HER WAIST AND GROPED ABOUT THE ROOM FOR THE WATER JUG I FOUND IT AT LAST AND A GLASS BESIDE IT
HAVE DRIVEN OVER TO LUNCHEON AT BIGWOOD I SAW POOR PARADAY WEDGE HIMSELF BY COMMAND INTO THE LITTLE SUPPLEMENTARY SEAT OF A BROUGHAM IN WHICH THE PRINCESS AND OUR HOSTESS WERE ALREADY ENSCONCED
I RAISED HER IN MY ARMS AND STILL SHE DID NOT WAKE I CARRIED HER DOWN THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AND LAID HER ON THE BED THERE WAS A COVERLET FOLDED AT THE END OF THE BED AND I SPREAD IT OVER HER
I'M MADE RESTLESS BY THE SELFISHNESS OF THE INSINCERE FRIEND I WANT TO MONOPOLISE PARADAY IN ORDER THAT HE MAY PUSH ME ON TO BE INTIMATE WITH HIM IS A FEATHER IN MY CAP IT GIVES ME AN IMPORTANCE THAT I COULDN'T NATURALLY PRETEND TO
BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND OF ANY ONE BREATHING SO I STEPPED INTO THE ROOM THE FOG WAS LESS DENSE IT HUNG OUTSIDE THE WINDOW A THIN WHITE MIST AND BEHIND THAT MIST THE DAY WAS BREAKING I LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM
THE WHITE THING WAS A LIVE THING OF FLESH AND BLOOD I SPRANG UP ON THE BED AND JUMPED TO THE FOOT OF IT IT WAS VERY DARK IN THE ROOM BUT THROUGH THE DARKNESS I COULD SEE ON A LEVEL WITH MY FACE THE FACE OF A WOMAN
I POSITIVELY FEEL MY OWN FLESH SORE FROM THE BRASS NAILS IN NEIL PARADAY'S SOCIAL HARNESS THE HOUSE IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO LIKE HIM AS THEY MENTION AWFULLY
SHOULD I EXPLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND MY PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE FOR HELEN MAYLE'S SAKE I MUST NOT DO THAT SINCE HELEN MAYLE IT SURELY WAS WHOM I HELD IN MY ARMS I PROPPED HER SECURELY IN THE CHAIR THEN CROSSED THE ROOM
AGAIN THE QUEER GASPING COUGHING NOISE BROKE FROM HER LIPS AND AT LAST I UNDERSTOOD IT IT WAS A GASP OF A WOMAN STRANGLING TO DEATH THAT WHITE STIFF STREAK ABOVE HER HEAD I KNEW WHAT IT WAS TOO
AND EVERY ONE'S TELLING EVERY ONE WHERE THEY PUT IT LAST I'M SURE IT'S RATHER SMUDGY ABOUT THE TWENTIETH PAGE I'VE A STRONG IMPRESSION TOO THAT THE SECOND VOLUME IS LOST HAS BEEN PACKED IN THE BAG OF SOME DEPARTING GUEST
I SAT UP IN MY BED WITH MY HEART BEATING VERY QUICK
AND FINALLY LIFTED ONE AND HELD HER THROAT WITH IT VERY LIKELY THERE WILL BE SOME WATER IN THE ROOM SAID I IF YOU ARE SAFE IF YOU WILL NOT FALL I WILL LOOK FOR IT THANK YOU SHE MURMURED
BUT FROM MISSUS WIMBUSH WHO HAD WISHED TO GIVE HER A GLIMPSE OF IT AS A SALVE FOR HER NOT BEING ABLE TO STAY AND HEAR IT READ IS THAT THE PIECE HE'S TO READ I ASKED WHEN GUY WALSINGHAM ARRIVES
I SLIPPED THE NOOSE BACK OVER HER HEAD AND LEFT IT DANGLING THE WOMAN I LAID DOWN UPON THE BED WHERE SHE LAY CHOKING AND MOANING I FLUNG UP THE WINDOW AND THE COLD FOG POURED INTO THE ROOM
INFURIATE ME QUITE SO MUCH HE LOOKS VERY FAGGED AND HAS AT LAST CONFESSED TO ME THAT HIS CONDITION MAKES HIM UNEASY HAS EVEN PROMISED ME HE'LL GO STRAIGHT HOME INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO HIS FINAL ENGAGEMENTS IN TOWN
I COULD FEEL HER BREATH UPON MY CHEEK AND IT CAME STEADILY AND REGULAR I CANNOT DESCRIBE MY ASTONISHMENT SHE WAS IN A DEEP SLEEP I PONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHAT I SHOULD DO SHOULD I WAKE THE HOUSEHOLD
THE PRINCESS IS A MASSIVE LADY WITH THE ORGANISATION OF AN ATHLETE
I FELT MYSELF AGAIN SLIPPING DOWN THE WET GRASS AND DANGLING OVER THE PRECIPICE I HEARD AGAIN THAT UNEARTHLY SCREECHING WHICH HAD SO FRIGHTENED DICK AND PERPLEXED ME IT PERPLEXED ME STILL
AND THE END OF THE SCARF RAN UP TO THE CROSS BEAM ABOVE THE BED POSTS THE SCARF WAS THE STREAK OF WHITE I FUMBLED AT THE KNOT WITH MY FINGERS IT WAS A SLIP KNOT AND NOW THAT NO WEIGHT KEPT IT TAUT IT LOOSENED EASILY
LAST NIGHT I HAD SOME TALK WITH HIM ABOUT GOING TO DAY CUTTING HIS VISIT SHORT SO SURE AM I THAT HE'LL BE BETTER AS SOON AS HE'S SHUT UP IN HIS LIGHTHOUSE HE TOLD ME THAT THIS IS WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DO
I APPRECIATE IT IT KEEPS ME WARM THERE ARE NO FIRES IN THE HOUSE MISSUS WIMBUSH GOES BY THE CALENDAR THE TEMPERATURE GOES BY THE WEATHER THE WEATHER GOES BY GOD KNOWS WHAT AND THE PRINCESS IS EASILY HEATED
SHE NESTLED DOWN BENEATH IT AND HER LIPS SMILED VERY PRETTILY AND SHE UTTERED A LITTLE PURRING MURMUR OF CONTENT BUT THIS SHE DID IN HER SLEEP SHE SLEPT WITH THE UNTROUBLED SLEEP OF A CHILD
WHICH MEANS OF COURSE THAT MISSUS WIMBUSH HAS FORCIBLY ANNEXED HER SHE'S TO COME OVER IN A DAY OR TWO MISSUS WIMBUSH WANTS HER TO HEAR MISTER PARADAY TO DAY'S WET AND COLD AND SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY AT THE INVITATION OF THE DUKE
HE MAKES NO SECRET OF BEING MORTALLY AFRAID OF HER AND WHEN I ASK WHAT HARM SHE CAN DO HIM THAT SHE HASN'T ALREADY DONE HE SIMPLY REPEATS I'M AFRAID I'M AFRAID DON'T ENQUIRE TOO CLOSELY HE SAID LAST NIGHT
FOR THE SOUND WAS NEITHER A SCREECH LIKE THAT WHICH ROSE FROM THE HOLLOW NOR A GROAN NOR ANY GHOSTLY NOISE IT WAS PURELY HUMAN IT WAS A KECKING SOUND IN THE THROAT SUCH AS ONE MAKES WHO GASPS FOR BREATH
SWORE TO THE FALSEHOOD OTHERS REMAINED GLOOMILY SILENT AND THE BRAVEST OF THEM RETIRED TO THE HIGHLANDS WHERE THEY DWELL AMONGST THEIR MOUNTAINS TILL THE CRIES OF SCOTLAND CALLED THEM AGAIN TO FIGHT HER BATTLES
BUT THOMAS EARL OF LANCASTER THE KING'S NEPHEW IS COME FROM ABROAD WITH A NUMEROUS ARMY HE IS TO CONDUCT THE SCOTTISH PRISONERS TO THE BORDERS AND THEN TO FALL UPON SCOTLAND WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH
WHO IS AT THIS TIME TWENTY SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE WENT TO DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING A GOOD EDUCATION
AS THEY WENT BAREHEADED HABITUALLY THEIR HAIR STOOD OUT IN THICK COARSE SUNBURNT SHOCKS THEIR BEARD COVERED THEIR THROATS AND FELL IN MATS DOWN THE BREAST MANTLES OF THE SKIN OF KIDS AND LAMBS WITH THE FLEECE ON WRAPPED THEM FROM NECK TO KNEE
HE WOULD PUT LORD DOUGLAS INTO CLOSER CONFINEMENT AND WHILE THE SOUTHRON FLEETS WOULD INEVITABLY BAFFLE WALLACE'S ATTEMPTS THE MOMENT THE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS WAS COMPLETED ON THE BORDERS AN ARMY FROM ENGLAND SHOULD ENTER SCOTLAND AND RAVAGE IT WITH FIRE AND SWORD
BRETHREN LET US GO SEE THIS THING WHICH HAS COME TO PASS THE PRIESTS AND DOCTORS HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR THE CHRIST NOW HE IS BORN AND THE LORD HAS GIVEN US A SIGN BY WHICH TO KNOW HIM LET US GO UP AND WORSHIP HIM BUT THE FLOCKS
I HAVE FREQUENTLY HEARD IT ASSERTED BY WHITE PEOPLE AND CAN TRULY SAY FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE
WHEN THE SHELIACH READ THE TEXT NONE LISTENED TO THE INTERPRETER WITH MORE ABSOLUTE FAITH AND NONE TOOK AWAY WITH THEM MORE OF THE ELDER'S SERMON OR GAVE IT MORE THOUGHT AFTERWARDS
A MILE AND A HALF IT MAY BE TWO MILES SOUTHEAST OF BETHLEHEM THERE IS A PLAIN SEPARATED FROM THE TOWN BY AN INTERVENING SWELL OF THE MOUNTAIN BESIDES BEING WELL SHELTERED FROM THE NORTH WINDS
WHY THEN THIS UNRECEDING DETERMINATION TO INVADE US NOT A BLADE OF GRASS WOULD I DISTURB ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHEVIOT IF WE MIGHT HAVE PEACE LET EDWARD YIELD TO THAT AND THOUGH HE HAS PIERCED US WITH MANY WOUNDS WE WILL YET FORGIVE HIM DE WARENNE SHOOK HIS HEAD
AT BIRTH IT BECAME HIS CHARGE HIS TO KEEP ALL ITS DAYS TO HELP OVER THE FLOODS TO CARRY DOWN THE HOLLOWS TO NAME AND TRAIN IT WAS TO BE HIS COMPANION HIS OBJECT OF THOUGHT AND INTEREST THE SUBJECT OF HIS WILL
WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN THEY LED THE WAY TO THE MARAH AND BY NIGHTFALL HAD EVERYTHING SAFE IN THE FIELD THEN THEY KINDLED A FIRE DOWN BY THE GATE PARTOOK OF THEIR HUMBLE SUPPER AND SAT DOWN TO REST AND TALK LEAVING ONE ON WATCH
AND IN THE LAST CAPACITY WENT TWO OR THREE TIMES TO PHILADELPHIA TO ASSIST IN MAKING TREATIES WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES THOMAS HAD FOUR WIVES BY WHOM HE HAD EIGHT CHILDREN JACOB JEMISON HIS SECOND SON BY HIS LAST WIFE
I KNOW MY KING TOO WELL TO EXPECT PACIFIC MEASURES HE MAY DIE WITH THE SWORD IN HIS HAND BUT HE WILL NEVER GRANT AN HOUR'S REPOSE TO THIS COUNTRY TILL IT SUBMITS TO HIS SCEPTER THEN REPLIED WALLACE THE SWORD MUST BE THE PORTION OF HIM AND HIS
THOMAS EXCEPT WHEN INTOXICATED WHICH WAS NOT FREQUENT WAS A KIND AND TENDER CHILD WILLING TO ASSIST ME IN MY LABOR
HIS TASK WAS DONE NOW FOR THE DREAMLESS SLEEP WITH WHICH LABOR BLESSES ITS WEARIED CHILDREN HE MOVED TOWARDS THE FIRE BUT PAUSED A LIGHT WAS BREAKING AROUND HIM SOFT AND WHITE LIKE THE MOON'S HE WAITED BREATHLESSLY
FEW MOTHERS PERHAPS HAVE HAD LESS TROUBLE WITH THEIR CHILDREN DURING THEIR MINORITY THAN MYSELF IN GENERAL MY CHILDREN WERE FRIENDLY TO EACH OTHER AND IT WAS VERY SELDOM THAT I KNEW THEM TO HAVE THE LEAST DIFFERENCE OR QUARREL
GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND ON EARTH PEACE GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN WHEN THE SHEPHERDS CAME FULLY TO THEIR SENSES THEY STARED AT EACH OTHER STUPIDLY UNTIL ONE OF THEM SAID IT WAS GABRIEL THE LORD'S MESSENGER UNTO MEN NONE ANSWERED
AND THAT WAS OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE SHEPHERDS WHO DROVE THEIR CHARGES THITHER THAN THE HOUSE ITSELF THE STONE WALL AROUND THE LOT WAS HIGH AS A MAN'S HEAD YET NOT SO HIGH BUT THAT SOMETIMES A PANTHER OR A LION HUNGERING FROM THE WILDERNESS LEAPED BOLDLY IN
TURNED ROSEATE AND BEGAN TO TREMBLE THEN UP FAR AS THE MEN COULD SEE THERE WAS FLASHING OF WHITE WINGS AND COMING AND GOING OF RADIANT FORMS AND VOICES AS OF A MULTITUDE CHANTING IN UNISON
THE CHILD IS HERE THEY WERE LED TO ONE OF THE MANGERS AND THERE THE CHILD WAS THE LANTERN WAS BROUGHT AND THE SHEPHERDS STOOD BY MUTE THE LITTLE ONE MADE NO SIGN IT WAS AS OTHERS JUST BORN WHERE IS THE MOTHER ASKED THE WATCHMAN
I REVERE YOUR PRINCIPLE SIR WILLIAM WALLACE BUT IT IS TOO SUBLIME TO BE MINE NAY NOR WOULD IT BE POLITIC FOR ONE WHO HOLDS HIS POSSESSIONS IN ENGLAND BY THE RIGHT OF CONQUEST TO QUESTION THE VIRTUE OF THE DEED
FOR MY SON THOMAS FROM SOME CAUSE UNKNOWN TO ME FROM THE TIME HE WAS A SMALL LAD ALWAYS CALLED HIS BROTHER JOHN A WITCH WHICH WAS THE CAUSE AS THEY GREW TOWARDS MANHOOD OF FREQUENT AND SEVERE QUARRELS BETWEEN THEM
AS WAS HER HABIT IN THOSE DAYS ROME DID NOT WAIT FOR PEOPLE SLOW TO INQUIRE ABOUT HER SHE CAME TO THEM OVER THE HILLS ALONG WHICH HE WAS LEADING HIS LAGGING HERD OR IN THE FASTNESSES IN WHICH HE WAS HIDING THEM
THOUGH HIS AMIABLE NATURE MADE HIM GRACIOUS IN THE MIDST OF HOSTILITY AND HIS GOOD DISPOSITIONS WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO ACT DISGRACEFULL IN ANY CONCERN YET DUTY TO GOD SEEMED A POET'S FLIGHT TO HIM
IT WAS TO ENLIVEN AND SHARE HIS WANDERINGS IN ITS DEFENSE HE MIGHT BE CALLED ON TO FACE THE LION OR ROBBER TO DIE THE GREAT EVENTS SUCH AS BLOTTED OUT NATIONS AND CHANGED THE MASTERY OF THE WORLD
THE CHRIST THEY ALL REPEATED FALLING UPON THEIR KNEES IN WORSHIP ONE OF THEM REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES OVER IT IS THE LORD AND HIS GLORY IS ABOVE THE EARTH AND HEAVEN AND THE SIMPLE MEN NEVER DOUBTING KISSED THE HEM OF THE MOTHER'S ROBE
WHEN THEY WERE EXPANDED MANY CUBITS BEYOND HIS STATURE HE AROSE LIGHTLY AND WITHOUT EFFORT FLOATED OUT OF VIEW TAKING THE LIGHT UP WITH HIM LONG AFTER HE WAS GONE DOWN FROM THE SKY FELL THE REFRAIN IN MEASURE MELLOWED BY DISTANCE
THE CANNIBAL BLACKS HAD DISAPPEARED AND CONTINUED TO EXIST ONLY IN THE FANCIES OF THE MARINERS SCOTT'S RESIDENCE WAS OPPOSITE NEW YEAR'S ISLAND NOT FAR FROM THE SHORE
NEVER TO SPEAK OF SUCH THINGS WHEN BRIGITTE SPOKE THUS I EXPERIENCED A FEELING THAT RESEMBLED AVARICE I CAUGHT HER IN MY ARMS AND CRIED O GOD
AND WE SIT DOWN IN OUR TEARS AS DID ADAM AT EDEN'S GATE AND IN ORDER TO CURE OUR WOUND WE HAVE BUT TO MAKE A MOVEMENT OF THE HAND AND MOISTEN OUR THROATS
NINE FREE WOMEN AND THEIR TWENTY TWO CHILDREN AND A CREW OF TWENTY SIX SEVERAL SHIPS HAD BEEN WRECKED ON KING'S ISLAND
FOR IT HAS SEEN OUR WOES
ONE NIGHT AS I WAS SEATED ON THE BENCH PLUNGED IN FRIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY I SAW A BELATED WORKMAN STAGGERING ALONG THE STREET
WHO HAD TAKEN UP IS ABODE ON THE ISLAND WITH HIS HAREM THREE TASMANIAN GINS AND SEVEN CHILDREN THEY WERE THE ONLY PERMANENT INHABITANTS
AND WITH THE FLINT AND STEEL THEY STRUCK A LIGHT AND MADE A FIRE WHEN THEY WENT DOWN TO THE BEACH IN SEARCH OF SHELLFISH ONE MAN KEPT GUARD AT THE BARRICADE AND LOOKED OUT FOR THE BLACKFELLOWS HIS MUSKET WAS LOADED WITH POWDER AND PEBBLES
I KNOW NOT WHETHER IT IS WITH JOY OR WITH FEAR THAT I TREMBLE I AM ABOUT TO CARRY OFF MY TREASURE DIE MY YOUTH DIE ALL MEMORIES OF THE PAST DIE ALL CARES AND REGRETS
PERHAPS BEFORE I KNEW YOU ANOTHER WOMAN MIGHT HAVE CURED ME BUT NOW YOU ALONE OF ALL THE WORLD HAVE POWER TO DESTROY ME OR TO SAVE ME
I AM SO PROUD AND SO FOOLISH THAT I DARE NOT ENTER A TAVERN AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT IF ALL UNFORTUNATES ENTER THERE IT IS IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY COME OUT HAPPY OH
IS SAID TO BE AS GOOD AS BREAD IN THE MONTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE HEAVY GALES WERE BLOWING OVER KING'S ISLAND FOR FOURTEEN DAYS THE SCHOONER ELIZABETH WITH WHALERS FOR PORT FAIRY
NEVERTHELESS THIS EVENING HE HAD A PIECE OF MONEY IN HIS POCKET HE ENTERED A TAVERN WHERE HE PURCHASED OBLIVION HE HAS EARNED ENOUGH IN A WEEK TO ENJOY A NIGHT OF SLUMBER
IT WAS NOW NOTHING BUT DREAMS OF HAPPINESS AND VOWS OF ETERNAL LOVE I WISHED ONCE FOR ALL TO MAKE MY DEAR MISTRESS FORGET ALL THE SUFFERING I HAD CAUSED HER
AND I WILL WHISPER TO YOU THAT NOT LONG SINCE I LOVED A TERRIBLE FELLOW WHO MADE ME VERY UNHAPPY YOU WILL REPROVE ME AND CLOSE MY MOUTH AND WE WILL AGREE
FINALLY HE FELL ON A BENCH FACING ANOTHER HOUSE OPPOSITE ME THERE HE LAY STILL SUPPORTED ON HIS ELBOWS AND SLEPT PROFOUNDLY THE STREET WAS DESERTED
HOW HAD I BEEN ABLE TO RESIST SUCH PROOFS OF TENDER AFFECTION AND COURAGEOUS RESIGNATION NOT ONLY DID BRIGITTE PARDON ME BUT SHE WAS WILLING TO MAKE A STILL GREATER SACRIFICE
SO THE LOOK OUT MAN DID NOT GO TO SLEEP
I SUDDENLY CRIED OUT WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM WHO TOLD YOU TO DRY MY TEARS IS THIS YOUR VOCATION AND DO YOU THINK I DESIRE YOU
HE HAD OBTAINED THREE COPIES OF THE GRANT SIGNED BY THREE BROTHERS JAGGA JAGGA BY BUNGAREE YAN YAN MOORWHIP AND MARMARALLAR
I STOPPED BEFORE THE SLEEPER WHAT SLEEP I SAID SURELY THIS MAN DOES NOT DREAM HIS CLOTHES ARE IN TATTERS HIS CHEEKS ARE WRINKLED HIS HANDS HARDENED WITH TOIL
NEVERTHELESS OUR PREPARATIONS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY AND I BECAME IMPATIENT TO GET AWAY AT THE SAME TIME I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD HARDLY REST
THEY DISEMBARKED ON ITS BANKS PLOUGHED SOME LAND SOWED MAIZE AND WHEAT AND PLANTED TWO THOUSAND FRUIT TREES THEY WERE NOT SO GRASPING AS BATMAN AND EACH MAN PEGGED OUT A FARM OF ONLY ONE HUNDRED ACRES
I COULD SEE THE LIGHTS IN HER ROOM I COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF HER PIANO AT TIMES I SAW SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A SHADOW THROUGH THE PARTIALLY DRAWN CURTAINS
HOW SHALL I TELL HOW DEEPLY I REPENTED MY CRUELTY WHEN I LOOKED UPON HER SMILING FACE
THEN RETURNED AND RESUMED MY SEAT I COULD NOT LEAVE THAT DOOR AT WHICH I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOCKED FOR AN EMPIRE
AND THE MEN ARMED THEMSELVES WITH ANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF WEAPONS THEY COULD FIND BUT THEIR MAIN HOPE OF VICTORY WAS THE MUSKET THEY COULD NOT EXPECT TO KILL MANY CANNIBALS WITH ONE SHOT
SHE OBSERVED MY EMOTION AND INQUIRED THE CAUSE I COULD NOT REPLY SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT I HAD SOME SECRET SORROW AND FOREBORE ANY ATTEMPT TO LEARN THE CAUSE
BRIGITTE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE LAKE
YOU HAVE DRUNK LIKE THE CHILD THAT YOU ARE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU WERE DOING SIT DOWN IN THIS CHAIR AND WAIT UNTIL A CAB PASSES YOU WILL TELL ME WHERE YOU LIVE AND I WILL ORDER THE DRIVER TO TAKE YOU HOME TO YOUR MOTHER
BUT SPAIN
AND RESEMBLING HER COMPANIONS IN NO WAY EXCEPT IN THE HARSHNESS OF HER VOICE WHICH WAS ROUGH AND BROKEN AS THOUGH IT HAD PERFORMED THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC CRIER SHE LOOKED AT ME CLOSELY
WHICH PASSED OVER HIM FOR A LONG TIME BEING UNACCUSTOMED TO HEAR IT HIS EAR HAD HAD REST
THOUGH LATE AWARE OF THY PRIDE CRUELTY AND AMBITION COME HITHER NOT TO ASK AUGHT NOR WITH THE HOPE EVEN IF WE WERE SO DISPOSED OF OBTAINING IT BUT TO REMIND THEE OF THE BENEFITS THOU HAST RECEIVED FROM THE PEOPLE OF MILAN
DID NOT EXHIBIT EITHER BY WORDS OR GESTURES ANY UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT AND REPLIED THAT HE WILLINGLY ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR ANGRY FEELINGS ALL THE SERIOUS CHARGES OF THEIR INDISCREET HARANGUE AND HE WOULD REPLY TO THEM IN DETAIL WERE HE IN THE PRESENCE OF ANYONE WHO COULD DECIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES
AND I MUST CONFESS THAT I AM DISAPPOINTED I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN ALMOST CHILDISH CURIOSITY ABOUT THAT OLD CHEST BUT I SEEM FATED NOT TO HAVE IT GRATIFIED THAT ONE THING MUST BE HER WEDDING DRESS
AND EXPRESS TO HIM MY GRATITUDE FOR THE HONOR HE HAS DONE ME RAOUL BOWED ON WHAT DAY WILL HIS MAJESTY ARRIVE CONTINUED THE PRINCE THE KING MONSEIGNEUR WILL IN ALL PROBABILITY ARRIVE THIS EVENING
AS HE WAS PASSING UNDER THE PORCH LEADING HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE
COSMO DE MEDICI DISPOSED TO DO SO THE FLORENTINES SENT AMBASSADORS TO THE COUNT AFTER THIS VICTORY THE COUNT MARCHED INTO THE BRESCIAN TERRITORY OCCUPIED THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND THEN PITCHED HIS CAMP WITHIN TWO MILES OF THE CITY THE VENETIANS
THAT OLD GARRET WAS A VERITABLE FAIRYLAND TO ME THERE WAS ONE OLD CHEST WHICH I COULD NOT EXPLORE AND LIKE ALL FORBIDDEN THINGS IT POSSESSED A GREAT ATTRACTION FOR ME IT STOOD AWAY BACK IN A DUSTY COBWEBBED CORNER
THE COUNT'S SUCCESSES THE VENETIANS COME TO TERMS WITH HIM VIEWS OF THE VENETIANS
SENT THEM ONE THOUSAND FOOT AND TWO THOUSAND HORSE BY WHOSE AID THE VENETIANS WERE IN A CONDITION TO TREAT FOR PEACE AT ONE TIME IT SEEMED THE FATE OF THEIR REPUBLIC TO LOSE BY WAR AND WIN BY NEGOTIATION FOR WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM THEM IN BATTLE WAS FREQUENTLY RESTORED TWOFOLD ON THE RESTORATION OF PEACE
CARE WILL BE TAKEN OF THAT GENTLEMAN I HOPE ADDED MADAME
THE SOLDIER MADE A PROFOUND BOW AND
IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT SO GREAT MILITARY SUPERIORITY COMBINED WITH SUCH AN EXTENT OF TERRITORY WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO THEMSELVES
SHE ALWAYS WORE STIFFLY RUSTLING GOWNS OF RICH SILK MADE IN THE FASHION OF HER YOUTH I SUPPOSE SHE MUST HAVE CHANGED HER DRESS OCCASIONALLY
THAT IS FROM ELIZA SHE SAID I WOULD KNOW HER WRITING ANYWHERE NONE OF YOUR MODERN SPRAWLY UNTIDY HANDS BUT A FINE LADY LIKE SCRIPT AS REGULAR AS COPPERPLATE READ THE LETTER WINNIFRED
AND IF AS EVER HE IS STILL THE ENEMY OF THE WICKED DO NOT THEREFORE PROMISE THYSELF ANY CERTAINTY OF VICTORY FOR THE JUST WRATH OF THE ALMIGHTY WILL WEIGH HEAVILY UPON THEE AND WE ARE RESOLVED TO LOSE OUR LIBERTY ONLY WITH OUR LIVES
AND WAS MY CHILDISH IDEAL OF ALL THAT WAS HIGH BRED AND GRACEFUL I HAD MANY BELOVED HAUNTS AT THE GRANGE BUT I LIKED THE GARRET BEST IT WAS A ROOMY OLD PLACE BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE COMFORTABLY HOUSED A FAMILY IN ITSELF
AND WE WERE INVITED TO A BALL THAT EVENING THIS YELLOW GOWN IS THE VERY ONE SHE WORE I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY SHE PUT IT AWAY HERE THE GOWN SHE WORE ON THE HAPPIEST NIGHT OF HER LIFE I HAD NEVER SEEN HER LOOK MORE BEAUTIFUL
RAOUL STOPPED EVEN WITH THE LOWER END OF THE TABLE SO AS TO BE EXACTLY BETWEEN MONSIEUR AND MADAME FROM THIS PLACE HE MADE A PROFOUND BOW TO MONSIEUR AND A VERY HUMBLE ONE TO MADAME THEN DRAWING HIMSELF UP INTO MILITARY POSE
HAVING COME TO THIS AGREEMENT
AS OF SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN STRICKEN A MORTAL BLOW
WITH WHOM THEY MADE PEACE AND ENTERED INTO ALLIANCE
AND AFTERWARDS I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY WE WENT EAGERLY UP THE GARRET STAIRS AUNT KNELT DOWN BEFORE THE OLD CHEST AND SELECTED A KEY FROM THE BUNCH AT HER BELT WOULD IT NOT BE TOO PROVOKING AMY IF THIS KEY SHOULD NOT FIT AFTER ALL WELL I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD BE ANY MORE DISAPPOINTED THAN I
AND THOUGH AMBITION SHOULD BLIND THINE EYES THE WHOLE WORLD WITNESS TO THINE INIQUITY WILL COMPEL THEE TO OPEN THEM GOD HIMSELF WILL UNCLOSE THEM IF PERJURIES IF VIOLATED FAITH IF TREACHERIES DISPLEASE HIM
AND TO FURNISH HIM DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF THE WAR FOUR THOUSAND HORSE AND TWO THOUSAND FOOT
UNSEALED IT AS HE WOULD HAVE UNSEALED A SUSPICIOUS PACKET AND IN ORDER TO READ IT SO THAT NO ONE SHOULD REMARK THE EFFECTS OF IT UPON HIS COUNTENANCE HE TURNED ROUND MADAME FOLLOWED WITH AN ANXIETY ALMOST EQUAL TO THAT OF THE PRINCE EVERY MANEUVER OF HER AUGUST HUSBAND
WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED GRAVITY MONSIEUR TURNED HIS EYES IN A CERTAIN MANNER UPON THE PEOPLE OF HIS SUITE SO THAT ALL PAGES OFFICERS AND EQUERRIES QUITTED THE SERVICE KNIVES AND GOBLETS AND MADE TOWARDS THE SECOND CHAMBER DOOR A RETREAT AS RAPID AS IT WAS DISORDERLY
THAT THE SOVEREIGNTY WHICH IS COMMENCED IN DECEIT AND VILLAINY WILL TERMINATE EITHER IN THYSELF OR THY CHILDREN WITH IGNOMINY AND BLOOD THE COUNT THOUGH NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE JUST REPROACHES OF THE MILANESE
I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THAT REVERENTLY WE PUT GOWNS AND LETTERS AND TRINKETS BACK INTO THE OLD BLUE CHEST AUNT WINNIFRED CLOSED THE LID AND TURNED THE KEY SOFTLY
BUT I CANNOT BEAR THAT ANYONE BUT MYSELF SHOULD SEE OR TOUCH THAT ONE THING SO PLEASE LEAVE THE CHEST AS IT IS DEAR AUNT IT IS NO MATTER IF THE MOTHS DO GET IN THAT IS ALL
AND WHATEVER ELSE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY HIM DURING THE LATE CAMPAIGNS AND CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THOSE TERRITORIES WHICH THE DUKE POSSESSED AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH WHEN THIS TREATY BECAME KNOWN AT MILAN IT GRIEVED THE CITIZENS MORE THAN THE VICTORY AT CARAVAGGIO HAD EXHILARATED THEM
DO YOU KNOW HIM WHY YES
MUCH NEARER MONSEIGNEUR HIS MAJESTY MUST BY THIS TIME HAVE ARRIVED AT MEUNG DOES THE COURT ACCOMPANY HIM YES MONSEIGNEUR
TO BIND THEM BY THE TIES OF INTEREST AND THEREFORE IN ASSIGNING TO EACH THEIR PORTION OF THE ENTERPRISE HE CONSENTED THAT THE VENETIANS SHOULD ATTACK CREMA AND HIMSELF WITH THE OTHER FORCES ASSAIL THE REMAINDER OF THE TERRITORY
WHICH COULD NEVER BE UNITED TO INJURE OTHERS AND SEPARATELY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO TO ATTAIN THIS HE SAW NO BETTER MEANS THAN TO REFRAIN FROM AIDING THE COUNT AND CONTINUING IN THE FORMER LEAGUE WITH THE VENETIANS THESE REASONINGS WERE NOT SATISFACTORY TO COSMO'S FRIENDS
COWPERWOOD STUDIED THE HANDWRITING THE PAPER THE PHRASEOLOGY FOR A GIRL OF ONLY A LITTLE OVER TWENTY THIS WAS WISE AND RESERVED AND TACTFUL SHE MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM AT HIS RESIDENCE
NO AND YOU NEVER STUDIED ACTING NO SHE SHOOK HER HEAD IN A SLOW SAD ENTICING WAY THE BLACK HAIR CONCEALING HER EARS MOVED HIM STRANGELY
AND THE SIGHT OF THAT UGLY DEVIL IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE'S BLOOD BOIL WHEN HE SAW MY FACE HE SEEMED TO REALISE DANGER IMMEDIATE DANGER AND SLUNK OUT OF THE ROOM AS NOISELESSLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT I LEARNED ONE THING HOWEVER
HE RESPONDED KEENLY TO HER IMPULSE TO DO OR BE SOMETHING IN THIS WORLD WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND HE LOOKED ON THE SMART EGOISTIC VANITY OF SO MANY WITH A KINDLY TOLERANT ALMOST PARENTAL EYE
HE PASSED ON A LITTLE LATER WHEN HIS STEPS TOOK HIM NATURALLY ENOUGH
AND HOW LILLA LOOKED AND WHAT MIMI SAID AND DID ALSO OOLANGA CASWALL'S WEST AFRICAN SERVANT I'LL DO WHAT I CAN SIR ALL THE TIME MISTER CASWALL WAS STARING HE KEPT HIS EYES FIXED AND MOTIONLESS
YOU AND I THEREFORE WHO BOTH LOVE HIM THOUGH IN DIFFERENT WAYS SHOULD MAKE IT OUR BUSINESS TO PROTECT HIM FROM ALL DISTURBING INFLUENCES I AM SURE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT ANY LABOUR TO THIS END WOULD BE WELL SPENT
LET ME SEE IT'S NOTHING MUCH SHE REPLIED DEPRECATINGLY I DON'T DRAW VERY WELL GIFTED GIRL HE REPLIED PICKING IT UP PAINTS DRAWS CARVES ON WOOD PLAYS SINGS ACTS
YOU ALSO OBSERVED THAT MIMI WAS DISTURBED IN HER MIND AT THE WAY MISTER CASWALL LOOKED AT HER COUSIN CERTAINLY THOUGH DISTURBED IS A POOR WAY OF EXPRESSING HER OBJECTION CAN YOU REMEMBER WELL ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE CASWALL'S EYES
AIRS FROM THE ORIENT COWPERWOOD GAINED HIS FIRST REAL IMPRESSION OF STEPHANIE AT THE GARRICK PLAYERS WHERE HE WENT WITH AILEEN ONCE TO WITNESS A PERFORMANCE OF ELEKTRA HE LIKED STEPHANIE PARTICULARLY IN THIS PART
POOR LITTLE ORGANISMS GROWING ON THE TREE OF LIFE THEY WOULD BURN OUT AND FADE SOON ENOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE BALLAD OF THE ROSES OF YESTERYEAR BUT IF HE HAD IT WOULD HAVE APPEALED TO HIM
HER FULL RICH SHORT BLACK HAIR WAS CAUGHT BY A CHILDISH BAND OF BLOOD RED RIBBON HOLDING IT LOW OVER HER TEMPLES AND EARS HER LITHE BODY SO HARMONIOUS IN ITS GRAVEN ROUNDNESS
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SHOULD WE SHE ASKED NAIVELY AFTER A MOMENT PULLING AWAY FROM HIM STEPHANIE
BUT HEARSAY MUST GUIDE US AT FIRST YOU KNOW MY MAN DAVENPORT PRIVATE SECRETARY CONFIDENTIAL MAN OF BUSINESS AND GENERAL FACTOTUM HE IS DEVOTED TO ME AND HAS MY FULL CONFIDENCE
AND I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY I HAVE SCARCELY SEEN IT TELL ME ONE THING YES SHE DREW IN A SOFT BREATH FILLING HER CHEST AND EXPANDING HER BOSOM WHILE SHE LOOKED AT HIM FROM UNDER HER BLACK HAIR
FRANK ALGERNON COWPERWOOD PERSONAL IT WAS WRITTEN IN A SMALL NEAT CAREFUL HAND ALMOST PRINTED I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WONDERFUL PRESENT
SENSUOUS HEADS AND NECKS OF SLEEPING GIRLS CHINS UP EYELIDS DOWN STUDIES OF HER BROTHERS AND SISTER AND OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER DELIGHTFUL EXCLAIMED COWPERWOOD KEENLY ALIVE TO A NEW TREASURE GOOD HEAVENS
HE HAD THE HORRID LOOKING SNAKES HE DID NOT SEEM TO SEE ADAM NO ONE WAS TO BE SEEN AT MERCY EXCEPT A FEW WORKMEN IN THE FARMYARD SO AFTER WAITING ON THE CHANCE OF SEEING MIMI ADAM BEGAN TO GO SLOWLY HOME
I THINK YOU'RE VERY WONDERFUL SHE MURMURED IS THAT ALL ISN'T THAT MUCH SHE SMILED SHOOTING A DULL BLACK OPAL LOOK IN HIS DIRECTION YOU WORE MY BRACELET TO DAY WERE YOU VERY GLAD TO GET IT
HE IS IN HIS WAY A CLEVER FELLOW FOR A NIGGER BUT IS NONE THE LESS DANGEROUS OR THE LESS HATEFUL FOR THAT THE MEN IN THE SHIP TOLD ME THAT HE WAS A COLLECTOR SOME OF THEM HAD SEEN HIS COLLECTIONS SUCH COLLECTIONS
SHE WAS STILL A LITTLE UNSCHOOLED IN THE WORLD HER HEART WAS ESSENTIALLY POETIC AND INNOCENT NO ONE HAD EVER GIVEN HER MUCH OF ANYTHING NOT EVEN HER PARENTS HER ALLOWANCE THUS FAR IN LIFE
ALL RATHER BADLY SHE SIGHED TURNING HER HEAD LANGUIDLY AND LOOKING AWAY IN HER SKETCH BOOK SHE HAD PUT ALL OF HER BEST DRAWINGS THERE WERE SKETCHES OF NUDE WOMEN DANCERS TORSOS BITS OF RUNNING FIGURES SAD HEAVY
SHE GATHERED THEM UP IN HER HANDS AND KISSED THEM FASTENING THE EAR RINGS IN HER EARS AND ADJUSTING THE BRACELET AND RING DESPITE HER EXPERIENCE WITH HER FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HER STAGE ASSOCIATES AND HER PARAMOURS
WOULD SUCH A STRONG HARD BUSINESS MAN BE INTERESTED IN HER
HAVE YOU FOUND OUT ANYTHING YET REGARDING THE NEGRO I AM ANXIOUS TO BE POSTED REGARDING HIM I FEAR THERE WILL BE OR MAY BE GRAVE TROUBLE WITH HIM YES SIR I'VE HEARD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT HIM OF COURSE IT IS NOT OFFICIAL
AND IT MIGHT CONCERN HIM UNDULY EVEN ALARM HIM I PROMISE YOU THERE SHALL BE NOTHING THAT COULD CAUSE HIM ANXIETY IN OUR SILENCE OR AT WHICH HE COULD TAKE UMBRAGE GO ON SIR SAID ADAM SIMPLY
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL TO ME STEPHANIE HE SAID SIMPLY A STRANGE UNCERTAIN FEELING OF REAL AFFECTION CREEPING OVER HIM THE MAN'S GREATEST LOVE WAS FOR ART IT WAS HYPNOTIC TO HIM DID YOU EVER STUDY ART HE ASKED
FIRST GIVING HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CAMPMASTERS
AND MANY A BURGHER WHO BEHELD HIM THAT DAY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A TRIFLE FOR A PEEP BENEATH THE WHITE CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF WHICH HUNG SO OBTRUSIVELY FROM THE POCKET OF HIS SWALLOW TAILED COAT BUT WHAT MAINLY OCCASIONED A RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION WAS THAT THE SCOUNDRELLY POPINJAY
SUFFICE IT TO SAY HOWEVER THAT I SURVIVED THIS PSYCHIC CRISIS
WILMA HUNT FOR THAT RECORD I SAID KNOWING THAT BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF TALKING I COULD KEEP THE ENTIRE COMMAND CONTINUOUSLY INFORMED AS TO THE SITUATION ON THE HILLSIDES KEEP YOUR GUNS TRAINED ON THE CIRCLES AND STAND BY ON THE HILLTOPS HOW MANY OF YOU ARE THERE
WHICH MATHEMATICIANS ARE AT TIMES FORCED TO PUT UP WITH IN CERTAIN ALGEBRAIC FORMULAE THE DATE I MAY THUS SAY IN REGARD TO THE REMOTENESS OF ITS ANTIQUITY CANNOT BE LESS THAN ANY ASSIGNABLE QUANTITY WHATSOEVER
AND HE HAD A LONG HOOKED NOSE PEA EYES A WIDE MOUTH AND AN EXCELLENT SET OF TEETH WHICH LATTER HE SEEMED ANXIOUS OF DISPLAYING AS HE WAS GRINNING FROM EAR TO EAR WHAT WITH MUSTACHIOS AND WHISKERS THERE WAS NONE OF THE REST OF HIS FACE TO BE SEEN HIS HEAD WAS UNCOVERED
PIGEON WINGED HIMSELF RIGHT UP INTO THE BELFRY OF THE HOUSE OF THE TOWN COUNCIL WHERE THE WONDER STRICKEN BELFRY MAN SAT SMOKING IN A STATE OF DIGNITY AND DISMAY BUT THE LITTLE CHAP SEIZED HIM AT ONCE BY THE NOSE GAVE IT A SWING AND A PULL CLAPPED THE BIG CHAPEAU DE BRAS UPON HIS HEAD
AND INDEED THE CASE WAS JUST THE SAME WITH ALL THE OTHER CLOCKS AND WATCHES IN THE BOROUGH NEVER WAS SUCH A PLACE FOR KEEPING THE TRUE TIME WHEN THE LARGE CLAPPER THOUGHT PROPER TO SAY TWELVE O'CLOCK ALL ITS OBEDIENT FOLLOWERS OPENED THEIR THROATS SIMULTANEOUSLY
THE RASCAL BOUNCED AS I SAY RIGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THEM GAVE A CHASSEZ HERE AND A BALANCEZ THERE
SINCE THEY'RE SETTLING WITHOUT OPENING UP DISINTEGRATORS ANY OPINIONS MY EAR DISCS REMAINED SILENT
THE TOWN COUNCIL ARE ALL VERY LITTLE ROUND OILY INTELLIGENT MEN WITH BIG SAUCER EYES AND FAT DOUBLE CHINS AND HAVE THEIR COATS MUCH LONGER AND THEIR SHOE BUCKLES MUCH BIGGER THAN THE ORDINARY INHABITANTS OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS SINCE MY SOJOURN IN THE BOROUGH
BETWEEN EACH CABBAGE AND THE TIME PIECE AGAIN IS A LITTLE CHINA MAN HAVING A LARGE STOMACH WITH A GREAT ROUND HOLE IN IT THROUGH WHICH IS SEEN THE DIAL PLATE OF A WATCH THE FIREPLACES ARE LARGE AND DEEP WITH FIERCE CROOKED LOOKING FIRE DOGS
THE GABLES ARE TURNED TO THE FRONT AND THERE ARE CORNICES AS BIG AS ALL THE REST OF THE HOUSE OVER THE EAVES AND OVER THE MAIN DOORS THE WINDOWS ARE NARROW AND DEEP WITH VERY TINY PANES AND A GREAT DEAL OF SASH
THEY HAVE THREE CORNERED COCKED HATS PURPLE WAISTCOATS REACHING DOWN TO THEIR THIGHS BUCKSKIN KNEE BREECHES RED STOCKINGS HEAVY SHOES WITH BIG SILVER BUCKLES LONG SURTOUT COATS WITH LARGE BUTTONS OF MOTHER OF PEARL EACH TOO HAS A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH
FOR THEY NEEDED NOT THE FORESTS IN WHICH THE AMERICANS LIVED NOR THE RESOURCES OF THE VAST TERRITORIES THESE FORESTS COVERED WITH THE PERFECTION TO WHICH THEY HAD REDUCED THE SYNTHETIC PRODUCTION OF NECESSITIES AND LUXURIES
AND UNTIL MY RECENT FLASH OF INSPIRATION NO ONE AMONG THEM APPARENTLY HAD EVER THOUGHT OF THE SCHEME OF SHOOTING A ROCKET INTO A REPELLOR BEAM AND LETTING THE BEAM ITSELF HURL IT UPWARD INTO THE MOST VITAL PART OF THE HAN SHIP HART PATIENTLY PLACED HIS MEN
I DESIGN HERE TO GIVE A HISTORY OF THE CALAMITOUS EVENTS WHICH HAVE SO LATELY OCCURRED WITHIN ITS LIMITS NO ONE WHO KNOWS ME WILL DOUBT THAT THE DUTY THUS SELF IMPOSED WILL BE EXECUTED TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY WITH ALL THAT RIGID IMPARTIALITY ALL THAT CAUTIOUS EXAMINATION INTO FACTS
AND RESPONDED LIKE A VERY ECHO IN SHORT THE GOOD BURGHERS WERE FOND OF THEIR SAUER KRAUT BUT THEN THEY WERE PROUD OF THEIR CLOCKS ALL PEOPLE WHO HOLD SINECURE OFFICES ARE HELD IN MORE OR LESS RESPECT
ITS FACES ARE LARGE AND WHITE AND ITS HANDS HEAVY AND BLACK THERE IS A BELFRY MAN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO ATTEND TO IT BUT THIS DUTY IS THE MOST PERFECT OF SINECURES FOR THE CLOCK OF VONDERVOTTEIMITTIS WAS NEVER YET KNOWN TO HAVE ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH IT
FOR THE HAN CITIES WERE ENTIRELY ENCLOSED WITH SPLENDID ARRANGEMENTS FOR VENTILATION AND HEATING THESE ARRANGEMENTS OF COURSE WERE EQUALLY ADEQUATE IN THEIR AIRSHIPS THE HANS INDEED HAD QUITE A DISTASTE FOR UNSHADED DAYLIGHT SINCE THEIR LIGHTING APPARATUS DIFFUSED A CONTROLLED AMOUNT OF VIOLET RAYS
AND CATERWAULING AND SQUALLING AND FLYING INTO THE FACES AND RUNNING UNDER THE PETTICOATS OF THE PEOPLE AND CREATING ALTOGETHER THE MOST ABOMINABLE DIN AND CONFUSION WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A REASONABLE PERSON TO CONCEIVE AND TO MAKE MATTERS STILL MORE DISTRESSING
THAT ONE WAS CONTAINED ENTIRELY IN A SMALL POCKET CASE THESE WITH WHICH WE WERE NOW EQUIPPED CONSISTED OF A PAIR OF EAR DISCS EACH A SEPARATE AND SELF CONTAINED RECEIVING SET THEY SLIPPED INTO LITTLE POCKETS OVER OUR EARS IN THE FABRIC HELMETS WE WORE
WITH BOTH HANDS MAKING A GREAT SHOW THE NINCOMPOOP OF PLAYING JUDY O'FLANNAGAN AND PADDY O'RAFFERTY AFFAIRS BEING THUS MISERABLY SITUATED I LEFT THE PLACE IN DISGUST AND NOW APPEAL FOR AID TO ALL LOVERS OF CORRECT TIME AND FINE KRAUT
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET THEM GET US ON THE RUN UNH WE'LL SET A TRAP FOR THE YELLOW DEVILS IN THE UNH VALLEY
HART WARNED WE'LL RISK IT
ELEVEN SAID THE BIG ONE ELEBEN ASSENTED THE LITTLE ONES TWELVE SAID THE BELL DVELF THEY REPLIED PERFECTLY SATISFIED AND DROPPING THEIR VOICES UND DVELF IT IS SAID ALL THE LITTLE OLD GENTLEMEN PUTTING UP THEIR WATCHES
AND HAD MADE NO FURTHER PRACTICAL PENETRATION INTO THE FIELD OF ETHEREAL PULSATIONS THAN THE PRIMITIVE RADIO AND TELEVISION OF THAT DAY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS THE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE WORLD
OR UTTERLY DESTROYED BY THE SHIP'S DISINTEGRATOR RAYS WHICH APPARENTLY HAD CONTINUED TO OPERATE IN THE MIDST OF ITS WARPED REMAINS FOR SOME MOMENTS AFTER THE CRASH IT WAS UNPLEASANT WORK SEARCHING THE MANGLED BODIES OF THE CREW BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE
HE DESCENDED THE HILLS AT A GREAT RATE SO THAT EVERY BODY HAD SOON A GOOD LOOK AT HIM HE WAS REALLY THE MOST FINICKY LITTLE PERSONAGE THAT HAD EVER BEEN SEEN IN VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS HIS COUNTENANCE WAS OF A DARK SNUFF COLOR
THE CLOCKS CARVED UPON THE FURNITURE TOOK TO DANCING AS IF BEWITCHED WHILE THOSE UPON THE MANTEL PIECES COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN THEMSELVES FOR FURY AND KEPT SUCH A CONTINUAL STRIKING OF THIRTEEN
THE BOSS HAD HARDLY FINISHED HIS ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE RING BARRAGE WHEN ONE OF THE SCOUTS ON AN EMINENCE TO THE NORTH ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF SEVEN HAN SHIPS SPREAD OUT IN A GREAT SEMI CIRCLE HART LEAPED FOR THE HILLSIDE
AS CLARKE FELL BACK WITH A GROAN AND LET THE PAPER DROP FROM HIS HANDS I DON'T FEEL VERY WELL VILLIERS I AM SUBJECT TO THESE ATTACKS POUR ME OUT A LITTLE WINE THANKS THAT WILL DO I SHALL FEEL BETTER IN A FEW MINUTES
SUCH RAYMOND IS THE STORY OF WHAT I KNOW AND WHAT I HAVE SEEN THE BURDEN OF IT WAS TOO HEAVY FOR ME TO BEAR ALONE AND YET I COULD TELL IT TO NONE BUT YOU VILLIERS WHO WAS WITH ME AT THE LAST KNOWS NOTHING OF THAT AWFUL SECRET OF THE WOOD
I DO WHO IS IT IT IS MISSUS HERBERT ARE YOU SURE I AM PERFECTLY SURE OF IT POOR MEYRICK HE IS ONE MORE CHAPTER IN HER HISTORY
ABOUT A THOUSAND YEARS I BELIEVE LORD ARGENTINE THOUGHT SHE WAS CHAFFING HIM YOU KNOW BUT WHEN HE LAUGHED SHE SAID SHE WAS SPEAKING QUITE SERIOUSLY AND OFFERED TO SHOW HIM THE JAR OF COURSE HE COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE AFTER THAT BUT IT SEEMS RATHER ANTIQUATED FOR A BEVERAGE DOESN'T IT
TO SEE THAT WHICH WAS ON THE BED LYING THERE BLACK LIKE INK TRANSFORMED BEFORE MY EYES THE SKIN AND THE FLESH AND THE MUSCLES AND THE BONES AND THE FIRM STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN BODY THAT I HAD THOUGHT TO BE UNCHANGEABLE
THE DISCOVERY IN PAUL STREET A FEW MONTHS AFTER VILLIERS MEETING WITH HERBERT MISTER CLARKE WAS SITTING AS USUAL BY HIS AFTER DINNER HEARTH RESOLUTELY GUARDING HIS FANCIES FROM WANDERING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BUREAU
I DON'T EXACTLY SEE WHAT MORE CAN BE SAID OR DONE IN THE MATTER YOU EVIDENTLY THINK THERE IS A MYSTERY OF SOME KIND BUT HERBERT IS DEAD WHERE THEN DO YOU PROPOSE TO LOOK I PROPOSE TO LOOK FOR THE WOMAN THE WOMAN WHOM HE MARRIED SHE IS THE MYSTERY
STATING THAT HE HAD ATTENDED THE LATE MISTER MEYRICK DURING HIS ILLNESS AND THAT THE DECEASED HAD EXPRESSED AN EARNEST WISH THAT THE ENCLOSED PACKET SHOULD BE SENT TO ME AFTER HIS DEATH THAT WAS ALL AND HAVEN'T YOU WRITTEN FOR FURTHER PARTICULARS
THE TWO MEN SAT SILENT BY THE FIRESIDE
WHICH I AM SURE IT WAS THE MAN'S LIFE WAS ALL A TRAGEDY AND A TRAGEDY OF A STRANGER SORT THAN THEY PUT ON THE BOARDS AND THAT IS THE STORY IS IT SAID CLARKE MUSINGLY YES THAT IS THE STORY
AND THE LAND OVER THE SEA ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS THE VALLEY AND THE RIVER AND HILL FOLLOWING HILL AS WAVE ON WAVE AND WOOD AND MEADOW AND CORNFIELD AND WHITE HOUSES GLEAMING AND A GREAT WALL OF MOUNTAIN AND FAR BLUE PEAKS IN THE NORTH
IN ONE CORNER THERE WAS A PILE OF NEWSPAPERS LITTERED ON THE FLOOR AND I BEGAN LOOKING AT THEM THEY WERE PAPERS OF THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO SOME OF THEM HALF TORN
THE LIGHT WITHIN THE ROOM HAD TURNED TO BLACKNESS NOT THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT IN WHICH OBJECTS ARE SEEN DIMLY FOR I COULD SEE CLEARLY AND WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT IT WAS THE NEGATION OF LIGHT OBJECTS WERE PRESENTED TO MY EYES IF I MAY SAY SO WITHOUT ANY MEDIUM
WHETHER THERE CAN BE ANY ONE WHO CAN SHOW THE LAST LINK IN THIS CHAIN OF AWFUL MYSTERY I DO NOT KNOW BUT IF THERE BE ANY ONE WHO CAN DO THIS YOU RAYMOND ARE THE MAN AND IF YOU KNOW THE SECRET IT RESTS WITH YOU TO TELL IT OR NOT AS YOU PLEASE
VILLIERS PICKED UP THE FALLEN SKETCH AND TURNED IT OVER AS CLARKE HAD DONE YOU SAW THAT HE SAID THAT'S HOW I IDENTIFIED IT AS BEING A PORTRAIT OF HERBERT'S WIFE OR I SHOULD SAY HIS WIDOW
THE DANCE ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP THE SCENES BY LONELY SHORES IN GREEN VINEYARDS BY ROCKS AND DESERT PLACES PASSED BEFORE HIM A WORLD BEFORE WHICH THE HUMAN SOUL SEEMED TO SHRINK BACK AND SHUDDER
I HATE MELODRAMA AND NOTHING STRIKES ME AS MORE COMMONPLACE AND TEDIOUS THAN THE ORDINARY GHOST STORY OF COMMERCE BUT REALLY VILLIERS IT LOOKS AS IF THERE WERE SOMETHING VERY QUEER AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THIS THE TWO MEN HAD WITHOUT NOTICING IT TURNED UP ASHLEY STREET
HAD GOT A BAD NAME IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD I HAD THE CURIOSITY TO GO AND LOOK AT THE PLACE FOR MYSELF IT'S A SADDENING KIND OF STREET THE HOUSES ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE MEAN AND DREARY BUT NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE QUAINT
I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU IMMEDIATELY ON MY GETTING BACK TO TOWN I HAVE BEEN IN THE COUNTRY FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS PERHAPS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GUESS IN WHICH PART WHILE THE HORROR AND WONDER OF LONDON WAS AT ITS HEIGHT
AS I PROFESSED MYSELF TO BE SHOULD TROUBLE ABOUT A VILLAGE TRAGEDY OF WHICH THEY GAVE A VERY COMMONPLACE VERSION AND AS YOU MAY IMAGINE I TOLD NOTHING OF WHAT I KNEW MOST OF MY TIME WAS SPENT IN THE GREAT WOOD THAT RISES JUST ABOVE THE VILLAGE AND CLIMBS THE HILLSIDE
FRAGMENTS OF TESSELLATED PAVEMENT WHICH THE PLACE CONTAINS I WAS SHOWN A SMALL SQUARE PILLAR OF WHITE STONE WHICH HAD BEEN RECENTLY DISCOVERED IN THE WOOD OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING AND AS I FOUND ON INQUIRY IN THAT OPEN SPACE WHERE THE ROMAN ROAD BROADENS OUT
HE SAID HE DARE NOT THAT WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD HAUNTED HIM BY NIGHT AND DAY
WHAT DO YOU THINK I COULDN'T SAY TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF IT WAS AFTER TURNING THE PORTRAIT IN HIS HANDS THAT HE NEARLY DROPPED FROM THE CHAIR THE NAME YOU KNOW WAS WRITTEN ON THE BACK QUITE SO AFTER ALL IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO ANY RESOLUTION IN A CASE LIKE THIS
AND THAT I WAS IN MY REAL AND TRUE SENSES I THEN FIXED MY EYES QUIETLY ON WHAT WAS BEFORE ME THOUGH HORROR AND REVOLTING NAUSEA ROSE UP WITHIN ME AND AN ODOUR OF CORRUPTION CHOKED MY BREATH I REMAINED FIRM
BUT AFTER ALL IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE FACTS MAY BE EXPLAINED IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER AS TO YOUR OWN SENSATIONS WHEN YOU WENT TO SEE THE HOUSE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY WERE DUE TO A VIVID IMAGINATION
THAT CAUSED DISSOLUTION AND CHANGE HERE TOO WAS ALL THE WORK BY WHICH MAN HAD BEEN MADE REPEATED BEFORE MY EYES I SAW THE FORM WAVER FROM SEX TO SEX DIVIDING ITSELF FROM ITSELF AND THEN AGAIN REUNITED
HE HEARD WHAT I HAD TO SAY WITH A GOOD DEAL OF INDIFFERENCE TILL I SHOWED HIM THE PORTRAIT IT WAS THEN THAT HE WAS SEIZED WITH THE ATTACK OF WHICH I SPOKE HE LOOKED GHASTLY I ASSURE YOU THEN HE MUST HAVE SEEN THE WOMAN BEFORE BUT THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER EXPLANATION
AND UNFOLDED THE OUTER COVERING INSIDE WAS A SECOND WRAPPING OF TISSUE AND VILLIERS TOOK IT OFF AND HANDED THE SMALL PIECE OF PAPER TO CLARKE WITHOUT A WORD THERE WAS DEAD SILENCE IN THE ROOM FOR FIVE MINUTES OR MORE
IT IS SOMETHING VERY RARE MEYRICK WAS A COLLECTOR PERHAPS NO I THINK NOT HARDLY A COLLECTOR
THIS IS A CHEERFUL LIFE SAID DICK SOME DAYS LATER TORP'S AWAY BESSIE HATES ME I CAN'T GET AT THE NOTION OF THE MELANCOLIA MAISIE'S LETTERS ARE SCRAPPY AND I BELIEVE I HAVE INDIGESTION
THE NEXT GOOD JOY THAT MARY HAD IT WAS THE JOY OF THREE TO SEE HER GOOD SON JESUS CHRIST MAKING THE BLIND TO SEE MAKING THE BLIND TO SEE GOOD LORD AND HAPPY WE MAY BE
IF ONLY TORP WERE BACK NOW BUT TORPENHOW WAS IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
AGAIN THE WHIRL OF WORDS BUT THIS TIME THEY CONVEYED A MEANING CAN YOU GIVE ME ANYTHING TO DRINK MANY SENTENCES WERE PRONOUNCED IN THAT DARKENED ROOM AND THE PRISONERS OFTEN NEEDED CHEERING
WE'LL GO TO THE PARK TO THINK IT OUT THEY HEADED FOR A CERTAIN TREE THAT DICK KNEW WELL AND THEY SAT DOWN TO THIN BECAUSE HIS LEGS WERE TREMBLING UNDER HIM AND THERE WAS COLD FEAR AT THE PIT OF HIS STOMACH
DICK FOUND A GLASS OF LIQUEUR BRANDY IN HIS HAND AS FAR AS I CAN GATHER HE SAID COUGHING ABOVE THE SPIRIT
THAT IF HIS FATE WERE BLINDNESS ALL THE TORPENHOWS IN THE WORLD COULD NOT SAVE HIM I CAN'T CALL HIM OFF HIS TRIP TO SIT DOWN AND SYMPATHISE WITH ME I MUST PULL THROUGH THIS BUSINESS ALONE HE SAID HE WAS LYING ON THE SOFA
AND MADDENED BY THE REFUSAL OF HIS BRAIN TO DO MORE THAN REPEAT THE NEWS THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO GO BLIND IT'S A HUMILIATING EXHIBITION HE THOUGHT AND I'M GLAD TORP ISN'T HERE TO SEE THE DOCTOR SAID I WAS TO AVOID MENTAL WORRY
SHE EXPLAINED HER ENDURING HATRED FOR DICK AND MADE IT CLEAR TO HIM THAT SHE ONLY SAT FOR THE SAKE OF HIS MONEY AND MISTER TORPENHOW'S TEN TIMES A BETTER MAN THAN YOU SHE CONCLUDED HE IS
AND THEY LEFT THE ROOM TO FIND LUNCH ELSEWHERE THEN HE SPOKE BUT SINCE THE REPROOF OF A FRIEND IS MUCH TOO SACRED AND INTIMATE A THING TO BE PRINTED AND SINCE TORPENHOW USED FIGURES AND METAPHORS WHICH WERE UNSEEMLY AND CONTEMPT UNTRANSLATABLE
HER FACE WAS ALWAYS VERY NEAR THE MELANCOLIA BEGAN TO FLAME ON THE CANVAS IN THE LIKENESS OF A WOMAN WHO HAD KNOWN ALL THE SORROW IN THE WORLD AND WAS LAUGHING AT IT IT WAS TRUE THAT THE CORNERS OF THE STUDIO DRAPED THEMSELVES IN GRAY FILM
FRONTAL BONE OPTIC NERVE EXTREME CAUTION AND THE AVOIDANCE OF MENTAL ANXIETY VERDICT HE SAID FAINTLY MY BUSINESS IS PAINTING AND I DAREN'T WASTE TIME WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
WELL SAID DICK BRUTALLY YOU'RE BETTER AS YOU ARE INSTEAD OF MAKING LOVE TO SOME DRUNKEN BEAST IN THE STREET HE FELT THAT HE HAD RESCUED TORPENHOW FROM GREAT TEMPTATION
WHICH WAS UNPLEASANTLY DAMP WHAT CAN I DO WHAT CAN I DO I HAVEN'T ANY NOTIONS LEFT AND I CAN'T THINK CONNECTEDLY BUT I MUST DO SOMETHING OR I SHALL GO OFF MY HEAD THE HURRIED WALK RECOMMENCED
AND WE CONSULT THE SURGEON SOMETIMES THE RIGGING AND THEN I ADVISE SOMETIMES THE ENGINES AND WE GO TO THE BRAIN SPECIALIST SOMETIMES THE LOOK OUT ON THE BRIDGE IS TIRED AND THEN WE SEE AN OCULIST
AND HE SAID NOTHING TILL DICK BEGAN TO DESCRIBE THE GRAY FILM IN THE STUDIO WE ALL WANT A LITTLE PATCHING AND REPAIRING FROM TIME TO TIME HE CHIRPED LIKE A SHIP MY DEAR SIR EXACTLY LIKE A SHIP SOMETIMES THE HULL IS OUT OF ORDER
AND SEEING THAT FEAR IS BUT WASTE OF THE LITTLE TIME LEFT ARE RIOTOUSLY HAPPY THE DAYS PASSED WITHOUT EVENT BESSIE ARRIVED PUNCTUALLY ALWAYS AND THOUGH HER VOICE SEEMED TO DICK TO COME FROM A DISTANCE
THE DOCTOR'S HAND TOUCHED THE SCAR OF THE SWORD CUT ON DICK'S HEAD AND DICK EXPLAINED BRIEFLY HOW HE HAD COME BY IT WHEN THE FLAME WAS REMOVED DICK SAW THE DOCTOR'S FACE AND THE FEAR CAME UPON HIM AGAIN THE DOCTOR WRAPPED HIMSELF IN A MIST OF WORDS
AND THAT WHETHER SHE LIKED IT OR NOT SHE SHOULD BE HIS WIFE THE MOOD PASSED NEXT MORNING BUT THE SIDEBOARD AND ALL UPON IT REMAINED FOR HIS COMFORT AGAIN HE SET TO WORK AND HIS EYES TROUBLED HIM WITH SPOTS AND DASHES AND BLURS
I COULDN'T PAINT EM SUDDEN DEATH COMES HOME TOO NEARLY AND THIS IS BATTLE AND MURDER FOR ME THE DAY WAS FAILING AND DICK THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT THE TWILIGHT OF THE BLIND HAD COME UPON HIM UNAWARE ALLAH ALMIGHTY HE CRIED DESPAIRINGLY
THAT MADE TORPENHOW REMOTE AND UNSYMPATHETIC AND FOR CHILDISH VANITY HURT SINCE TORPENHOW HAD NOT GIVEN A WORD OF PRAISE TO HIS WONDERFUL PICTURE BESSIE LOOKED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AFTER A LONG PAUSE AND SAW THE TWO WALKING UP AND DOWN AS USUAL
AND A WOMAN WHO TALKS TOO MUCH HE WOULD HAVE ANSWERED BUT AT THAT MOMENT THERE UNROLLED ITSELF FROM ONE CORNER OF THE STUDIO A VEIL AS IT WERE OF THE FLIMSIEST GAUZE HE RUBBED HIS EYES BUT THE GRAY HAZE WOULD NOT GO
I REALLY COULD NOT SAY I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT IT HAS COME WITHOUT ANY WARNING IF YOU WILL LET ME I'LL SIT HERE FOR A MINUTE AND THEN I'LL GO
I DID NOT KNOW I WAS DRUNK TILL I WAS TOLD BUT I MUST GO ON WITH MY WORK IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT THERE IT IS
WITH THE HURRIED FEET OF FEAR IT WAS AS THOUGH A BLACK SHADOW STOOD AT HIS ELBOW AND URGED HIM TO GO FORWARD AND THERE WERE ONLY WEAVING CIRCLES AND FLOATING PIN DOTS BEFORE HIS EYES WE NEED TO BE CALM BINKIE WE MUST BE CALM
ALL THOSE STUDIES OF BESSIE'S HEAD WERE NONSENSE AND THEY NEARLY BROUGHT YOUR MASTER INTO A SCRAPE I HOLD THE NOTION NOW AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL THE MELANCOLIA THAT TRANSCENDS ALL WIT THERE SHALL BE MAISIE IN THAT HEAD BECAUSE I SHALL NEVER GET MAISIE
BINKIE WENT TO HIS OWN CHAIR AND AS OFTEN AS HE LOOKED SAW DICK WALKING UP AND DOWN RUBBING HIS HANDS AND CHUCKLING THAT NIGHT DICK WROTE A LETTER TO MAISIE FULL OF THE TENDEREST REGARD FOR HER HEALTH BUT SAYING VERY LITTLE ABOUT HIS OWN
I REALLY COULD NOT SAY ONE CANNOT ASCERTAIN THE EXACT AMOUNT OF INJURY INFLICTED BY THE SWORD CUT THE SCAR IS AN OLD ONE AND EXPOSURE TO THE STRONG LIGHT OF THE DESERT DID YOU SAY WITH EXCESSIVE APPLICATION TO FINE WORK
EATING HIS MOUSTACHE AND WONDERING WHAT THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT WOULD BE LIKE
A BOX CAR EITHER WRECKED OR MERELY LEFT STANDING COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE PURSUING ENGINE WAS ALMOST UPON IT
IF THEY'VE COME ALL THE WAY FROM KENTUCKY TO FIGHT FOR THE SOUTH
REPLIED THE MAN THAT SO ASKED WILSON I CAN THINK OF BETTER COMPANY IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT RIFLE WAVING AROUND IN THE AIR WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PUT YOUR HANDS UP AN KEEP EM UP ORDERED THE MAN
POST NUMBER R SIX THE CALL WAS REPEATED AS THOUGH BY AN ECHO I'M ONE OF THE RAILROAD RAIDERS CONTINUED TOM I'M
ANDREWS WAVED HIM ASIDE THROW THAT WOOD ABOARD MEN HE SAID BUT THEY HAD ALREADY ATTACKED THE PILE THEN THEY HEARD REPEATED SHORT BLASTS OF A WHISTLE TO THE SOUTHWARD THE MEN PAUSED AND LOOKED AT ANDREWS PILE IT IN HURRY HE YELLED
FULLER WATCHED IT BREATHLESSLY THERE CAME A CLASH OF METAL AS THE WHEEL SLIPPED DOWN FROM THE TIE AND STRUCK THE TRACK
GOOD LUCK TOM HE GLANCED BACK AND SAW HER STANDING THERE HER ARMS RAISED ABOVE HER HEAD THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD HER HANDKERCHIEF
IT HAD NEVER ENTERED HIS HEAD THAT THEIR LONG STRUGGLE AGAINST SO MANY OBSTACLES COULD END IN ANYTHING BUT GLORIOUS SUCCESS SURELY THEY COULD DO SOMETHING TO BLOCK THE WAY OF THE PURSUING ENGINE CAN'T WE STOP AND FIGHT HE ASKED
CAPTURED HALT THERE THE COMMAND CAME FROM BEHIND THEY WHIPPED ABOUT AND FOUND THEMSELVES FACING A RAISED RIFLE THE MAN WAS A CIVILIAN TALL AND LANKY HE WAVED THE RIFLE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WHERE'RE YOU GOING HE DEMANDED CHATTANOOGA
INSTINCTIVELY THEY TURNED TOWARD ANDREWS HE WAS IN THE FIREMAN'S SEAT HANDS CLENCHED AND FACE SET STARING AHEAD HE DID NOT MOVE UNTIL THEY WERE WITHIN SIGHT OF GREEN'S STATION THE GENERAL STOPPED AT THE WOOD PILE AND THE MEN JUMPED OUT
THE LAST DASH HERE WE ARE MARJORIE HE WENT FORWARD TO MEET HER
WHICH SWEPT HIS LEGS FROM UNDER HIM HE SANK DOWN ON THE FALLEN LOG WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SITTING TOGETHER EARLIER IN THE DAY CAN YOU RIDE ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY YES IF I ONCE GET MY LEGS WRAPPED AROUND HIM I CAN STICK THERE MARJORIE IF YOU'RE CAUGHT AT THIS
I DON'T DARE TO STOP AND BUILD A FIRE THEY'RE TOO CLOSE UPON US NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TOM REALIZED THAT THE RAID MIGHT FAIL IN ITS PURPOSE THE EXCITEMENT OF THE RACE OF REACHING THIS POINT WHERE THE ROAD TO CHATTANOOGA LAY CLEAR BEFORE THEM HAD BEEN UPON HIM
IT WAS NEARLY SIX O'CLOCK WHEN THEY REACHED THE LITTLE TOWN OF JUDSON AS THEY WENT DOWN THE MAIN STREET MEN AND BOYS TAGGED ALONG BESIDE THEM PLYING THE GUARDS WITH QUESTIONS THE GUARDS WAVED THEM ASIDE AND ANSWERED DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THEM OR NOT PICKED EM UP A PIECE DOWN THE ROAD
THAT HIS LEGS HAD BEEN TOO WEAK TO CARRY HIM HE LEANED FORWARD RIDING EASILY PEERING AHEAD AT THE ROAD STAR WAS WILLING BUT NO HORSE COULD STAND SUCH A PACE FOREVER SO HE REINED IN TO A TROT
WE'VE SNEAKED THROUGH THE UNION LINES FROM KENTUCKY AND CAME ACROSS THE TENNESSEE YESTERDAY THEN WE GOT ON THE WRONG ROAD
WHEN TWO HORSEMEN PULLED UP BEFORE THEM THEY YELLED WHEN THEY SAW THE THREE PRISONERS GOOD WORK ALF
THE FLANGE RODE ON THE RAIL THEN SETTLED INTO POSITION FORCING THE RIGHT WHEEL UP FULLER YELLED IN TRIUMPH KICKED THE TIE OFF THE TRACK AND JUMPED FOR THE LADDER THE STEAM HISSED AS THE TEXAS WAS THROWN INTO REVERSE AGAIN THEY SWEPT OUT OF THE SHED PUSHING THE TWO CARS
ANDREWS SLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK WE'LL HAVE TO BREAK THE WIRES ABOVE HERE
AT TILTON JUST A FEW MILES FARTHER ON
HE THINKS HE HAS SAID WILSON YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT YELLED ALF NO USE TALKIN LIKE THAT ALF SAID THE MAN ADDRESSED AS JUDGE WHERE DID YOU FIND THEM DOWN THE RINGGOLD ROAD ABOUT FIVE MILES A MURMUR AROSE FROM THE MEN
BROWN TOOK THE THROTTLE AND PUSHED THE GENERAL ONWARD TOWARD GREEN'S STATION TOM PUT THE LAST OF THE FUEL IN THE FIRE AND LEANED WEARILY AGAINST THE CAB DROPS OF RAIN CARRIED BY THE WIND SPLASHED UPON HIM AND RAN DOWN HIS BODY STREAKING THE SOOT WHICH COVERED HIS CHEST AND STOMACH
WHAT'S THE USE OF STANDING HERE IN THE MUD I'LL WALK YOU BACK TO JUDSON AN YOU CAN TELL YER STORY THERE I AIN'T BELIEVING YOU AND I AIN'T DISBELIEVING YOU TURN AROUND THE WAY YOU WAS A GOING
IN THE BOX CAR THE MEN SILENTLY DROPPED TIES UPON THE TRACKS SOMETIMES THERE WAS A MUMBLE OF SATISFACTION AS A TIE FELL SQUARELY ACROSS THE RAILS
BOUNDED STRUCK AGAIN AND THEN BOUNDED OUT OF THE WAY THE MEN SILENTLY WATCHED THE CAR ROLLING ALONG BEHIND THEM TOM SHOOK HIS HEAD IN DISGUST LET'S KNOCK THE ENDS OF THESE CARS OUT HE SAID ONCE AGAIN THEY TOOK THE RAIL UP AND BATTERED THEIR WAY THROUGH
THEN WHEN THEY TURNED NORTHWARD TOM COULD FEEL ALL THE STRENGTH OF THE FINE VALIANT ANIMAL HE WAS RIDING IT WAS A STRENGTH WHICH SEEMED TO FLOW INTO THE ROAD WHICH CARRIED HIM FORWARD IN LONG SWINGING LEAPS GO IT STAR HE SAID GO IT BOY IN HIS EXCITEMENT
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO THE HOUSE NOW I CAN'T UNTIL YOU'RE ON THE ROAD WHY NOT PLEASE GO BACK NOW I I'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE MEN HAVE GONE
WHEN I COULD HELP YOU YOU'RE WORTH A DOZEN SOLDIERS HE EXCLAIMED THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE POOR TOM SHE SAID SOFTLY IT'S ALL SO TERRIBLE ISN'T IT AND SO WONDERFUL YOU MEN HAVE LEFT THE WHOLE SOUTH GASPING AT YOUR BRAVERY
PLOTTING OUT A WAY OF ESCAPING HE DECIDED TO REMAIN AT THE HOLE LISTENING FOR JOE'S VOICE
STAR'S HOOFS POUNDED UPON THE SOFT TURF THEN HIS BODY EMERGED FROM THE SHADOWS TOM COULD SEE MARJORIE CROUCHING RIDING TO HIS GAIT HOLDING HIM DOWN FOR THE JUMP AT THE FENCE THERE WAS AN INSTANT'S PAUSE STAR'S FOREQUARTERS ROSE SLOWLY DELIBERATELY THEN
TOM PULLED ON THE REINS AND STAR PLANTED HIS FEET THEY WENT SLIDING PAST THE SENTRY WITH HIS RIFLE GLINTING IN THE MOONLIGHT HALT THERE CAME THE SECOND WARNING AS STAR CAME TO A STOP PUT YOUR HANDS UP TOM DROPPED THE REINS AND RAISED HIS HANDS STAR ALMOST WINDED
IF YOU'LL HELP ME MOUNT HE HELD HIS HANDS BRACED AGAINST HIS KNEES SO THAT THEY FORMED A STEP FOR HER SHE WAS UP ADJUSTING HERSELF TO THE SADDLE STROKING STAR'S NECK TALKING TO HIM SOFTLY YOU CLIMB THE FENCE AND WAIT ON THE OTHER SIDE SHE ORDERED
THEN WITH HIS HAT HE SLAPPED THE MAN'S HORSE ON THE HEAD HE WHOOPED AND DUG HIS HEELS INTO STAR'S FLANKS AS THEY SHOT FORWARD HE SAW THE OTHER HORSE REAR UP PAWING THE AIR
STAR FLOATED OVER THE FENCE HE HAD CLEARED IT BY A FOOT MARJORIE WHEELED ABOUT DISMOUNTED AND READJUSTED THE STIRRUPS THERE SHE SAID NOW NOW GO I CAN NEVER THANK YOU HE BEGAN DON'T PLEASE DON'T EVEN TRY SHE INTERRUPTED
EVERY BRANCH IN A TREE COMES FROM THE ROOT IN UNBROKEN CONNECTION
TRUE THOUGH IT MAY BE THAT THERE WERE SINS AND ERRORS AMONG THE SO CALLED HERETICS IT IS NO LESS TRUE AND EVIDENT HE SAYS FARTHER ON FROM THE INNUMERABLE EXAMPLES QUOTED HERE
AS EXAMPLES OF THESE QUESTIONS IN WHICH THE ANSWERS ARE TO SOME EXTENT INCLUDED ALSO I WILL QUOTE THE FOLLOWING UNDER THE FOURTH HEAD OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HERETICS ARE MADE HE SAYS IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE SEVENTH
BUT THERE CAN BE NO OUTER SIGNS BY WHICH ONE COULD RECKON ONESELF OR ANOTHER AS A MEMBER OF THIS HOLY BODY NOR BY WHICH ONE COULD PUT ANYONE OUTSIDE IT SO THAT NO INSTITUTION HAVING AN EXTERNAL EXISTENCE CAN CORRESPOND TO THIS IDEA
BY THE CHURCH BUT CHRIST COULD NOT HAVE FOUNDED THE CHURCH THAT IS WHAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND BY THAT WORD FOR NOTHING LIKE THE IDEA OF THE CHURCH AS WE KNOW IT NOW WITH ITS SACRAMENTS MIRACLES AND ABOVE ALL ITS CLAIM TO INFALLIBILITY
THAT IT COULD NOT BE COMPREHENSIBLE IN ITS FULL SIGNIFICANCE IT HAS BEEN ONLY BY A SUCCESSION OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS ERRORS PARTIAL EXPLANATIONS AND THE CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS OF GENERATIONS
AN ASSOCIATION OF MEN HAVING THE POPE AT ITS HEAD AND CONSISTING OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BOUND TOGETHER BY A CERTAIN ORGANIZATION FOOTNOTE THE CHURCH IS THE SOCIETY OF THE FAITHFUL
TO THE SOLE POSSESSION OF THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRIST'S TEACHING SUPPORTED BY MIRACULOUS EVIDENCE HAS LED BY LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT TO THE CREEDS OF THE CHURCHES A CHURCH COULD NOT BE FOUNDED BY CHRIST DEFINITIONS OF A CHURCH ACCORDING TO THE CATECHISMS
DID NOT NEED TO BE PROVED BY MIRACLES AND NEEDED NO EXERCISE OF FAITH BECAUSE THIS PROPOSITION IS IN ITSELF CONVINCING AND IN HARMONY WITH MAN'S MIND AND NATURE BUT THE PROPOSITION THAT CHRIST WAS GOD HAD TO BE PROVED BY MIRACLES COMPLETELY BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION
THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS PRECEPT IS ONLY TO BE FOUND IN UNINTERRUPTED PROGRESS TOWARD THE ATTAINMENT OF EVER HIGHER TRUTH TOWARD ESTABLISHING MORE AND MORE FIRMLY AN EVER GREATER LOVE WITHIN ONESELF AND ESTABLISHING MORE AND MORE WIDELY
WHO REJECTED ALL OUTWARD OBSERVANCES ABLUTIONS PURIFICATIONS FASTS AND SABBATHS IT WAS PLAINLY SAID
YET YOU WILL NOT FIND ANYWHERE ANYTHING
STRANGE THOUGH IT MAY SEEM TO US WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE ERRONEOUS VIEW OF THE CHURCH AS A CHRISTIAN INSTITUTION AND IN CONTEMPT FOR HERESY YET THE FACT IS THAT ONLY IN WHAT WAS CALLED HERESY WAS THERE ANY TRUE MOVEMENT
THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SEVERAL IN NUMBER AND HOSTILE TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT IS HERESY THE WORK OF G ARNOLD ON HERESIES
THE ONE TRULY CHRISTIAN CREED
AND MAINTAIN THAT ONE CANNOT ON ACCOUNT OF THESE ABUSES DENY THE PRINCIPLE ITSELF OF A CHRISTIAN CHURCH WHICH ALONE CAN BIND ALL MEN TOGETHER IN UNITY AND BE A MEDIATOR BETWEEN MEN AND GOD BUT THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE NOT ONLY HAVE CHURCHES NEVER BOUND MEN TOGETHER IN UNITY
AND POINTS OUT ALL THE UNLAWFULNESS THE ARBITRARINESS THE SENSELESSNESS AND THE CRUELTY OF USING THE WORD HERETIC IN THE SENSE OF REPROBATE THIS BOOK IS AN ATTEMPT TO WRITE THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE FORM OF A HISTORY OF HERESY
MEN WENT FURTHER AND FURTHER IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THE MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY AND REALIZED IT MORE AND MORE IN LIFE THE LONGER MANKIND LIVED THE CLEARER AND CLEARER BECAME THE MEANING OF CHRISTIANITY
WHAT IS THE PRACTICAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES TO DAY WHAT IS THEIR INFLUENCE UPON MEN WHAT IS DONE BY THE CHURCHES AMONG US AMONG THE CATHOLICS AND THE PROTESTANTS OF ALL DENOMINATIONS WHAT IS THEIR PRACTICAL WORK AND WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THEIR PRACTICAL WORK
HERETICS AND ANTI CHRISTIANS HE EXPOUNDS AMONG OTHER THINGS IN THESE QUESTIONS THE THEORY THAT ANY VERBAL EXPRESSION OF FAITH SUCH AS WAS DEMANDED BY THE CHURCH AND THE DEPARTURE FROM WHICH WAS RECKONED AS HERESY
THE HOLY GHOST LEFT THE CATHOLIC AND PASSED INTO THE CHURCH THEY PROFESSED AND THIS IS JUST WHAT THEY DO EVERY CHURCH TRACES ITS CREED THROUGH AN UNINTERRUPTED TRANSMISSION FROM CHRIST AND THE APOSTLES AND TRULY EVERY CHRISTIAN CREED
OPENLY ASSERT THIS IN THE CATHOLIC CATECHISM IT IS SAID
BY ASCRIBING TO THEMSELVES INFALLIBILITY THE CONCEPTION OF ONE CHURCH ONLY AROSE WHEN THERE WERE TWO SIDES DIVIDED AND DISPUTING WHO EACH CALLED THE OTHER SIDE HERESY AND RECOGNIZED THEIR OWN SIDE ONLY AS THE INFALLIBLE CHURCH
RECOGNIZE THE POPES AND NEW DOGMAS BUT WITH SUCH A DEFINITION OF THE CHURCH THERE IS STILL MORE DIFFICULTY IN RECONCILING AS HOMYAKOV TRIES TO DO THE CHURCH UNITED BY LOVE WITH THE CHURCH THAT RECOGNIZES THE NICENE CREED AND THE DOCTRINE OF PHOTIUS
THAT THE RESULTS OF THEIR ACTIVITY WERE ANTAGONISTIC TO CHRISTIANITY WE CANNOT BUT ADMIT THAT HOWEVER GOOD THE MEN WERE THE WORK OF THE CHURCH IN WHICH THESE MEN TOOK PART WAS NOT CHRISTIAN THE GOODNESS AND WORTH OF THESE MEN
THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE IS PRESENTED TO THE MEN OF OUR WORLD TO DAY AS A DOCTRINE WHICH EVERYONE HAS KNOWN SO LONG AND ACCEPTED SO UNHESITATINGLY
TO ASSERT OF ONE'S SELF OR OF ANY BODY OF MEN THAT ONE IS OR THEY ARE IN POSSESSION OF PERFECT UNDERSTANDING AND FULFILLMENT OF CHRIST'S WORD IS TO RENOUNCE THE VERY SPIRIT OF CHRIST'S TEACHING STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THE CHURCHES AS
THIS LACK OF TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF CHRIST'S WORDS AT SUCH A TIME WOULD BE INEXPLICABLE IF THERE WERE NOT CAUSES TO ACCOUNT FOR IT ONE OF THESE CAUSES
EACH ASSERTING ITS OWN INFALLIBILITY AND DENYING THAT OF ALL OTHER CHURCHES SO THAT THE ONE CHURCH IS ONLY A FANTASTIC IMAGINATION WHICH HAS NOT THE LEAST TRACE OF REALITY ABOUT IT AS A REAL HISTORICAL FACT
CHRISTIANITY MISUNDERSTOOD BY BELIEVERS MEANING OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE UNDERSTOOD BY A MINORITY HAS BECOME COMPLETELY INCOMPREHENSIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF MEN REASON OF THIS
THE GREEK ORTHODOX CATECHISM SAYS THE CHURCH IS A SOCIETY FOUNDED UPON EARTH BY JESUS CHRIST WHICH IS UNITED INTO ONE WHOLE BY ONE DIVINE DOCTRINE AND BY SACRAMENTS UNDER THE RULE AND GUIDANCE OF A PRIESTHOOD APPOINTED BY GOD
SAVE THOSE THAT ABIDE WITH THE WAINS TAKE HORSE AND RIDE WITHOUT DELAY AND CROSS THE WATER AT BATTLEFORD SO THAT WE MAY FALL UPON THE FOE BEFORE THEY COME WEST OF THE WATER FOR AS YE KNOW
AND THEY AND THE MEN WHO ABODE THEM ON THE BANK SHOUTED TOGETHER FOR JOY OF FELLOWSHIP AND ALL TOSSED ALOFT THEIR WEAPONS THE MAN WHO HAD RIDDEN BEHIND VIGLUND SLIPPED OFF ON TO THE GROUND BUT WOLFKETTLE ABODE IN HIS PLACE BEHIND GEIRBALD
TO RIGHT AND LEFT FLASHED THRONG PLOUGH WHILE THIODOLF HIMSELF SCARCE SEEMED TO GUIDE IT MEN FELL BEFORE HIM AT ONCE AND CLOSE AT HIS HEELS POURED THE WOLFING KINDRED INTO THE GAP
SUCH THEN WAS THE BATTLE IN MIRKWOOD GIVE ME THE MEAD HORN THAT I MAY DRINK TO THE LIVING AND THE DEAD AND THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD AND THE DEEDS OF THE LIVING THAT ARE TO BE SO THEY BROUGHT HIM THE HORN
SO FELL THE WHOLE HOST INTO DUE ARRAY AND THEY WERE SOMEWHAT OVER THREE THOUSAND WARRIORS ALL GOOD AND TRIED MEN AND MEET TO FACE THE UTTERMOST OF BATTLE IN THE OPEN FIELD SO THEY WENT THEIR WAYS WITH ALL THE SPEED THAT FOOTMEN MAY
BETWIXT THE OPENINGS OF WHICH THE BRACKEN GREW EXCEEDING TALL WHEN VIGLUND WHO WAS VERY FINE EARED DEEMED THAT HE HEARD A HORSE COMING TO MEET THEM
AND IN A MINUTE OF TIME WAS HE AMIDST OF THE THRONG AND FACE TO FACE WITH THE GOLD DIGHT CAPTAIN WHAT WITH THE SWEEP OF THRONG PLOUGH AND THE WOLFING ONRUSH THERE WAS SPACE ABOUT HIM FOR A GREAT STROKE HE GAVE A SIDE LONG STROKE TO HIS RIGHT
YET BY HIS SIDE WAS HIS MIGHTY SWORD AND WE ALL KNEW IT FOR THRONG PLOUGH AND WERE GLAD OF IT AND OF HIM AND THE UNFENCED BREAST OF THE DAUNTLESS SIX HOURS WE WENT SPREADING WIDE THROUGH THE THICKET
NOW OF THESE ELEVEN I ORDAIN HROSSHILD TO BE THE LEADER AND CAPTAIN AND TO CHOOSE FOR HER FELLOWS
NOR TO HEED ANYTHING BUT THE TRAIL OF THE FOEMEN THROUGH THE SOUTH EASTERN HEATHS OF MIRKWOOD WHETHER OTHER ROMANS FOLLOW HIM OR NOT WHATEVER HAPPENS LET HIM LEAD THE GOTHS BY THAT ROAD
THAT I COULD SEE THE DINTS UPON THEIR ARMOUR AND THE STRANDS OF THE WIRE ON THEIR SAX HANDLES DOWN THEN BOWED THE TALL BRACKEN ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE WOOD LAWN THE THICKET CRASHED BEFORE THE MARCH OF MEN AND ON THEY STRODE INTO THE LAWN
BUT LOOKING LIKE IMAGES FASHIONED OF BROWN COPPER AND IRON HOLDING THEIR CASTING SPEARS WHICH BE MARVELLOUS HEAVY WEAPONS AND GIRT WITH THE SAX AS THEY STOOD THERE
IF IT BE BUT ENOUGH FOR OUR EYEN TO SEE THE ROAD OF FIGHT
IS OVER THEN A DAMSEL BROUGHT HIM A HORN OF MEAD AND LET IT COME INTO HIS HAND AND HE DRANK SIGHING WITH PLEASURE WHILE THE DAMSEL FOR PLEASURE OF HIM AND HIS TIDINGS LAID HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER THEN HE SET DOWN THE HORN AND SPAKE
SO CAME WE UNTO WHERE THE THICKET ENDED SUDDENLY AND THERE WAS A LONG GLADE OF THE WILD WOOD ALL SET ABOUT WITH GREAT OAK TREES AND GRASS THEREUNDER WHICH I KNEW WELL
TILL THE JOY OF OUR HEARTS IN BATTLE BRING BACK THE DAY AGAIN AS HE SPAKE THAT WORD
HAD THE HORN BEEN SOUNDING AND THERE WERE NOW A MANY WARRIORS GATHERED AND MORE COMING IN EVERY MOMENT SO OTTER STOOD UP ON THE MOUND AFTER HE HAD BIDDEN A MAN OF HIS HOUSE TO BRING HIM HIS HORSE AND WAR GEAR
THAT THIODOLF AND HIS MEN WOULD SOON RETURN TO THEM AND IN ANY CASE THEY SAID HE LAY BETWEEN THE ROMANS AND THE MARK
BUT NOT MANY OF EITHER AND HERE AND THERE A HAZEL BRAKE EASY TO THRUST THROUGH THEN COMES A SPACE OF OAK TREES SCATTERED ABOUT THE LOVELY WOOD LAWN AND THEN AT LAST
BUT NOT AS DASTARDS AND HAD NOT THIODOLF FOLLOWED HARD IN THE CHASE ACCORDING TO HIS WONT THEY MIGHT EVEN YET HAVE MADE A FRESH STAND AND SPREAD FROM OAK TREE TO OAK TREE ACROSS THE GLADE BUT AS IT BEFEL THEY MIGHT NOT GET A FAIR OFFING
THOUGH A NEW FOE FOLLOWETH ON THINE HEELS NO NEED TO QUESTION ME MORE I HAVE NO MORE TO TELL SAVE THAT A WOMAN BROUGHT THESE TIDINGS TO US WHOM THE HALL SUN HAD SENT WITH OTHERS TO WATCH THE WAYS AND SOME OF THEM HAD SEEN THE ROMANS
IT HAS BEEN TOLD HOW OTTER HAD SENT THE BEARINGS
OR EVER THEY HAVE SET THEIR HANDS TO THE DWELLINGS OF MY HOUSE AND BELIKE WHEN I HAVE DONE MINE ERRAND TO OTTER I SHALL RIDE WITH HIM TO LOOK ON THESE BURNERS
AND THEY ATE AND DRANK AND WERE MERRY BUT AS FOR SPEEDING THE TIDINGS THE HALL SUN SENT TWO WOMEN AND TWO LADS ALL A HORSEBACK TO BEAR THE WORDS THE WOMEN TO REMEMBER THE WORDS WHICH SHE TAUGHT THEM CAREFULLY
AND WERE OUT OF THE THICK WOOD BY DAY DAWN AND WHEREAS THEY RODE HARD AND VIGLUND KNEW THE WAYS WELL THEY CAME TO MIRKWOOD WATER BEFORE THE DAY WAS OLD AND SAW THAT THE HOST WAS STIRRING BUT NOT YET ON THE WAY AND
BECAUSE WE BEAR THE MESSAGE THAT THE BATTLE ROAD YE TAKE NOR TARRY FOR THE THUNDER OR THE COMING ON OF RAIN OR THE WINDY CLOUDY NIGHT TIDE LEST YOUR BATTLE BE BUT VAIN
AND WE LEFT THEM FOR THE WOLVES TO DEAL WITH AND TWENTY FIVE MEN OF THE ROMANS WE TOOK ALIVE TO BE FOR HOSTAGES IF NEED SHOULD BE AND THESE DID WE SHIELDING MEN WHO ARE NOT VERY MANY BRING ABACK TO THE WAIN BURG
NAY RATHER TURN ABOUT WITH ME OR WHY ARE YE SO GRIM OF COUNTENANCE OUR ERRAND IS NO LIGHT ONE SAID GEIRBALD BUT THOU WHY ART THOU SO MERRY I HAVE SEEN THE ROMANS FALL SAID HE
SO THE MESSENGERS PASSED ON AND THE OTHERS CLOSED UP ROUND ABOUT THEM
AND IF YE BE TAKEN AND IT SEEM TO YOU THAT YE MAY NOT BEAR THE SMART OF THE ROMAN TORMENTS FOR THEY BE WISE IN TORMENTING BUT WILL SPEAK AND BEWRAY US UNDER THEM THEN THRUST THIS LITTLE EDGE TOOL INTO THE PLACE OF YOUR BODIES
WHO PROVED TO BE ONE OF MY AGGRAVATING POOR FOLKS A GREAT GIANT OF A WOMAN IN PERFECT HEALTH AND WITH A HUSBAND TO SUPPORT HER IF HE WILL I TOLD HER THAT I COULD DO NO MORE FOR HER SHE ANSWERED ME RUDELY AND KEPT URGING HER CLAIMS I FELT RUFFLED
I STUDIED AWHILE WITH MISTER UNDERHILL AT LAST HE SAID SCRIBBLING SOMETHING ON A BIT OF PAPER HERE IS A SENTENCE I HOPE YOU CAN TRANSLATE I TOOK IT AND READ THESE WORDS YOU ARE THE BRIGHTEST PRETTIEST MOST WARM HEARTED LITTLE THING IN THE WORLD
AMELIA GORDON HAS TOO MUCH GOOD SENSE TO BE CARRIED AWAY BY A HANDSOME FACE AND AGREEABLE MANNERS I BEGAN TO CRY HE LIKES ME I GOT OUT HE LIKES ME EVER SO MUCH
AND THIS WHOLE DAY HAS BEEN FRITTERED AWAY IN THE VERIEST TRIFLES IT ISN'T LIVING TO LIVE SO WHO IS THE BETTER FOR MY BEING IN THE WORLD SINCE SIX O'CLOCK THIS MORNING I AM FOR ONE SHE SAID KISSING MY HOT CHEEKS
BUT IT SHOWED A GOOD DEAL OF THOUGHT AND EARNESTNESS I MEANT TO ASK WHO HE WAS BUT FORGOT IT THIS HAS BEEN A DELIGHTFUL SUNDAY I HAVE REALLY FEASTED ON DOCTOR CABOT'S PREACHING BUT I AM SATISFIED
MEAN MORE TO HER THAN THESE ELABORATE RINGLETS POSSIBLY CAN THEY GET IN HER EYES AND MAKE HER NECK COLD SEE THEY ARE DRIPPING WITH WATER AND THE CHILD IS ALL IN A SHIVER SO SAYING MOTHER FOLDED A TOWEL ROUND ITS NECK
SEEMS TO BE THAT IS TRUE SHE REPLIED HIS RULING PASSION IS LOVE OF ADMIRATION THE LITTLE PLEASING ACTS THAT ATTRACT YOU ARE SO MANY TRAPS SET TO CATCH THE ATTENTION AND THE FAVORABLE OPINION OF THOSE ABOUT HIM
WHICH SHE ALWAYS WEARS AND OFTEN SHOWS ME ACCORDING TO HER HE IS EXACTLY LIKE THE HEROES I MOST ADMIRE IN BOOKS SHE SAYS SHE KNOWS HE WOULD LIKE ME IF WE SHOULD MEET BUT THAT IS NOT PROBABLE VERY FEW LIKE ME
OR WHAT WAS IT HE TOOK ME INTO HIS ARMS AND SAID MY PRECIOUS WIFE WHY WILL YOU TORMENT YOURSELF WITH SUCH FANCIES MY VERY HEART WAS YEARNING OVER YOU AT THAT MOMENT
AND SOME LITTLE ORNAMENTS WERE ARRANGED ABOUT THE ROOM MOTHER COMPLIMENTED HER ON HER NEATNESS AND SAID A QUEEN MIGHT SLEEP IN SUCH A BED AS THAT
HE HAS NOT ONE HONEST DESIRE TO PLEASE BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT TO BE PLEASING OH MY PRECIOUS CHILD WHAT A FATAL MISTAKE YOU ARE MAKING IN RELYING ON YOUR OWN JUDGMENT IN THIS
HOW STRANGE THAT WE EVER FORGET THAT WE ARE ALL SUCH
AND RAN UPSTAIRS TO PUT AWAY THE HOST OF LITTLE GARMENTS THE CHILDREN HAD LEFT WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR FLIGHT AND TO MAKE MYSELF PRESENTABLE AT LUNCH THEN I BEGAN TO BE UNEASY LEST ERNEST SHOULD NOT BE PUNCTUAL AND MARY BE DELAYED BUT HE CAME JUST AS THE CLOCK STRUCK ONE
AND HAD JUST HEARD THAT SHE WAS SICK AND IN GREAT WANT WE FOUND HER IN BED THERE WAS NO FURNITURE IN THE ROOM AND THREE LITTLE HALF NAKED CHILDREN SAT WITH THEIR BARE FEET IN SOME ASHES WHERE THERE HAD BEEN A LITTLE FIRE
AND NO MORTAL FORCE COULD OPEN IT I STOPPED CRYING AND SAT WITH FOLDED ARMS MOTHER SAID WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY AND THEN I CAME TO YOU MY DEAR OLD JOURNAL YES HE LIKES ME AND I LIKE HIM COME NOW
THAT SHE WOULD REALLY TRY TO EAT A MORSEL MORE WHICH ERNEST REMARKED DRYLY WAS A GREAT TRIUMPH OF MIND OVER MATTER AS THEY TALKED AND LAUGHED AND ATE LEISURELY ON
THAT I CAN AND SHALL GET WHAT I ASK FOR I WENT DOWN INTO THE KITCHEN PUT ON MY LARGE BAKING APRON AND BEGAN MY LABORS OF COURSE THE DOOR BELL RANG AND A POOR WOMAN WAS ANNOUNCED
I SAID IF NOT ITS DEATH BLOW MEANWHILE IN PUNISHING YOURSELF YOU PUNISH YOUR POOR INNOCENT FRIENDS HE SAID LAUGHING NO CHILD GO ON SINGING GOD HAS GIVEN YOU THIS POWER OF ENTERTAINING
WHAT A DEAR LITTLE THING SHE IS SHE AND HER BROTHER ARE SO MUCH ALIKE THE PLAN IS FOR US THREE GIRLS JENNY AMELIA AND MYSELF TO FORM OURSELVES INTO A LITTLE CLASS TO READ AND TO STUDY TOGETHER SHE SAYS CHARLEY
WHY THE POOR CREATURE LIKES TO SHOW OFF HER BRIGHT CARPET AND NICE BED HER CHAIRS HER VASES AND HER KNICK KNACKS AND SHE LIKES TO TALK ABOUT HER BELOVED MONEY AND HER BANK STOCK I MAY NOT HAVE DONE HER ANY GOOD BUT I HAVE GIVEN HER A PLEASURE
SWEET BEDSIDE MANNERS AND I AM SUCH A FAVORITE WITH HIM YOU KNOW ERNEST DID NOT RECEIVE HIS FAVORITE WITH ANY SPECIAL WARMTH BUT INVITED HER OUT TO LUNCH AND GALLANTED HER TO THE TABLE WE HAD JUST LEFT JUST LIKE A MAN
SOMETHING SEEMED TO SAY THIS CAPTIVE SINGS IN HIS CAGE BECAUSE IT HAS NEVER KNOWN LIBERTY AND CANNOT REGRET A LOST FREEDOM SO THE SOUL OF MY CHILD LIMITED BY THE RESTRICTIONS OF A FEEBLE BODY
POOR MARY SHE HAD TO FLY ROUND AND GET UP WHAT SHE COULD MISSUS WINTHROP DEVOTED HERSELF TO ERNEST WITH A PERSISTENT IGNORING OF ME THAT I THOUGHT RUDE AND UNWOMANLY SHE ASKED IF HE HAD READ A CERTAIN BOOK HE HAD NOT SHE THEN SAID
AND BECAUSE HE DOES NOT ENTIRELY NEGLECT ME SHE HAS PUT HER MOTHER UP TO COMING HERE MEDDLING AND MAKING IF WHAT YOU SAY OF AMELIA IS TRUE IT IS MOST UNGENEROUS IN YOU TO TELL OF IT BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT
AND AS SOON AS I GET HOME AM STUPID AND PEEVISH
AND NOW COMES THIS BLOW AT MY VANITY ON THE WHOLE I FEEL GREATLY OUT OF SORTS THIS EVENING
SOMEHOW I FORGOT TO TELL MOTHER THAT MISTER UNDERHILL WAS TO BE OUR TEACHER SO WHEN IT CAME MY TURN TO HAVE THE CLASS MEET HERE SHE WAS NOT QUITE PLEASED I TOLD HER SHE COULD STAY AND WATCH US AND THEN SHE WOULD SEE FOR HERSELF THAT WE ALL BEHAVED OURSELVES
AS I SAT WITH THIS PRECIOUS LITTLE GROUP ABOUT ME ERNEST OPENED THE DOOR LOOKED IN GRAVELY AND WITHOUT A WORD AND INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED I FELT UNEASY AND ASKED HIM THIS EVENING WHY HE LOOKED SO WAS I INDULGING THE CHILDREN TOO MUCH
AS A GENERAL RULE I DO NOT THINK POOR PEOPLE ARE VERY INTERESTING AND THEY ARE ALWAYS UNGRATEFUL WE WENT FIRST TO SEE OLD JACOB STONE I HAVE BEEN THERE A GOOD MANY TIMES WITH THE BASKETS OF NICE THINGS MOTHER TAKES SUCH COMFORT IN SENDING HIM
SHOULD THESE RESTRICTIONS EVER BE INFRINGED SANDFORD THANKED GIFFARD FOR HIS FRIENDLY INFORMATION IT SERVED HIM AS A SECOND WARNING OF THE CIRCUMSPECTION THAT WAS NECESSARY AND HAVING TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON
HAD TURNED BURGLAR AND BEEN SHOT IN THE ARM IN AN ATTEMPT AT HOUSEBREAKING WOULDN'T BE S'PRISED SAID THE AGENT IN AN AWED VOICE
YET SHE HAD THE PRUDENCE TO CONCEAL THOSE VAGUE HOPES FROM HIS CHILD LEST A DISAPPOINTMENT MIGHT PROVE FATAL AND ASSUMING A BEHAVIOUR NEITHER TOO MUCH ELATED OR DEPRESSED SHE ADVISED THAT THEY SHOULD HOPE FOR THE BEST BUT YET AS USUAL EXPECT AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST
TO SUFFER THAT SHE MAY RESIDE AT ONE OF MY SEATS DISPENSING AT THE SAME TIME WITH MY EVER SEEING HER AND YOU WILL COMPLY I WILL TILL SHE ENCROACHES ON THIS CONCESSION AND DARES TO HOPE FOR A GREATER
FOR THE REST OUR DEFENSE ON THIS OCCASION WAS AS TO ESSENTIALS WHAT OUR DEFENSE HAD BEEN AT THE INQUIRY BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE ONCE MORE THE JUDGES CONSULTED AND ONCE MORE THEY OVERRULED OUR OBJECTION THE CONFESSIONS WERE ADMITTED IN EVIDENCE
I TOLD YOU BEFORE I DID NOT BUT IT IS NO DOUBT SOMETHING IN FAVOUR OF HER CHILD I THINK NOT HE REPLIED SUCH AS IT IS HOWEVER I GRANT IT BUT IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD NO FARTHER AND ONE NEGLECT
ONE OF MC NUTT'S NUMEROUS OCCUPATIONS WAS RAISING A PATCH OF WATERMELONS EACH YEAR ON THE LOT BACK OF THE HOUSE THESE HE HAD FOSTERED WITH GREAT CARE SINCE THE PLANTS HAD FIRST SPROUTED THROUGH THE SOIL AND IN THESE LATE AUGUST DAYS TWO OR THREE HUNDREDS OF FINE BIG MELONS
OH HEAVENS EXCLAIMED MATILDA CLASPING HER HANDS TOGETHER AND THE TEARS FALLING STILL FASTER DO NOT BE SO MUCH ALARMED MY DEAR SAID MISS WOODLEY YOU KNOW WE ARE PREPARED FOR THE WORST AND YOU KNOW YOU PROMISED YOUR MOTHER WHATEVER YOUR FATE SHOULD BE TO SUBMIT WITH PATIENCE
YOU WILL THINK MY OBSTINACY INVINCIBLE I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT EVEN THEN WHERE I ASKED IN THE BACK YARD SHE REPLIED
I COULD TELL BY THE SECOND CLASS TASTE O THEM MELLINGS AN THEIR MEASLEY LITTLE SIZE THEM THINGS AIN'T A CIRCUMSTANCE TO THE KIND I RAISE ARE YOU SURE ASKED LOUISE
DON'T BETRAY US SIR PLEADED BETH I CAN'T REPLIED MC NUTT FRANKLY I'M IN IT MYSELF AN WE'LL JEST FIND OUT WHAT HIS BLAME TWISTED OL FIFTEEN CENT MELLINGS IS LIKE
JOE WAS PLANNING TO EXPLOIT A NEW PATENT AS SOON AS HE COULD EARN ENOUGH TO GET IT INTRODUCED AND ETHEL EXHIBITED A SUBLIME CONFIDENCE IN THE BOY'S ABILITY THAT RENDERED ALL QUESTION OF MONEY INSIGNIFICANT
DAN BRAYLEY'S PLACE WAS TWO MILES DISTANT BUT IN ANSWER TO PEGGY'S EARNEST INQUIRY IF SHE KNEW THE WAY BETH DECLARED SHE COULD FIND IT BLIND FOLDED
PATSY GIGGLED AND THE OTHERS FELT A SUDDEN IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TO JOIN HER KEEP STILL CAUTIONED MC NUTT WOULDN'T OL DAN BE JEST RAVIN EF HE KNEW THIS SAY HERE'S A RIPE ONE HEV A SLICE
NOTWITHSTANDING THE LITTLE AFFAIR OF THE LETTER IN WHICH HE HAD NOT APPEARED WITH ESPECIAL CREDIT
SAID SANDFORD I ONLY TOLD YOU WHAT WAS RIGHT NAY SAID MISS WOODLEY SHE DOES NOT WEEP FOR THAT SHE FEARS HER FATHER HAS NOT COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S REQUEST PERHAPS NOT EVEN READ HER LETTER YES HE HAS READ IT RETURNED SANDFORD
WHICH HIS SUDDEN ABSENCE MIGHT INFLICT ON OTHERS WAS PLAINLY IMPLIED IN HIS SECRET WITHDRAWAL FROM THE FARM THE SAME CRUEL INDIFFERENCE PUSHED TO A FURTHER EXTREME MIGHT WELL LEAD HIM TO PRESS HIS PROPOSALS PRIVATELY ON NAOMI
TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY TO WAIT UPON HIM AND LET HIM KNOW THAT HIS LORD HAD ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THE CONSENT HE HAD GIVEN FOR HIS DAUGHTER TO BE ADMITTED AT ELMWOOD CASTLE AND UPON WHAT RESTRICTIONS THAT HE HAD FARTHER UTTERED THE SEVEREST THREATS
NOT ENTIRELY REPLIED MATILDA AND SINCE IT IS GRANTED I AM CARELESS BUT SHE TOLD ME HER LETTER CONCERNED NONE BUT ME TO EXPLAIN PERFECTLY TO MATILDA LADY ELMWOOD'S LETTER AND THAT SHE MIGHT PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND UPON WHAT TERMS SHE WAS ADMITTED INTO ELMWOOD CASTLE
THAT THEY BELONGED TO HIS ENEMY BRAYLEY A BIT OF HARMLESS FUN BUT HERE WAS THE VINDICTIVE FELLOW ACTUALLY DESTROYING HIS OWN PROPERTY BY THE WHOLESALE OH DON'T PLEASE DON'T MISTER MC NUTT PLEADED PATSY IN FRIGHTENED ACCENTS
ON THE WAY HOME SHE CONFIDED TO HER COUSINS A METHOD OF SECURING REVENGE UPON THE AGENT FOR SELLING THEM THE THREE COPIES OF THE LIVES OF THE SAINTS
I GOT UP AND RAN TO THE WINDOW TO LOOK OUT
THE GOSSIPS WANTED TO KNOW ALL THE WHYS AND WHEREFORES BUT THE BOY KEPT HIS ROOM IN THE HOTEL OR ONLY WALKED OUT WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY ETHEL OR ONE OF THE THREE NIECES SOMETIMES THEY TOOK HIM TO RIDE AS HE GREW BETTER AND THE FACT THAT JOE WERE HAND AN GLOVE WI THE NABOBS
I THINK OUR CHANCES ARE BEST DON'T YOU SHE ASKED AND THEY DECIDED TO JOIN THE CONSPIRACY THERE WAS SOME DIFFICULTY ESCAPING FROM UNCLE JOHN AND THE MAJOR THAT NIGHT BUT PATSY GOT THEM INTERESTED IN A GAME OF CHESS THAT WAS LIKELY TO LAST SOME HOURS WHILE BETH STOLE TO THE BARN AND HARNESSED JOE TO THE SURREY
AND OVERJOYED AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING ONCE AGAIN IN HIS COMPANY PAINTING AT THE SAME TIME A THOUSAND BRIGHT HOPES FROM WATCHING EVERY EMOTION OF HIS SOUL AND CATCHING EVERY PROPER OCCASION TO EXCITE OR INCREASE HIS PATERNAL SENTIMENTS
THEN PRETEND TO BE FEARFUL OF DISCOVERY AT THE DAIRY AND BRING HIM ROUND THE CORNER SO THAT I CAN HEAR HIM BEHIND THE DOOR WE LEFT THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND SEPARATED SILENTLY NAOMI FOLLOWED MY INSTRUCTIONS WITH A WOMAN'S QUICK INTELLIGENCE
YOU MAY HAVE CAUSE TO RECALL IT I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE SAID REPLIED SANDFORD YOU HAVE SAID YOU GRANT LADY ELMWOOD'S REQUEST YOU CANNOT RECALL THESE WORDS NOR I MY GRATITUDE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HER REQUEST IS RETURNED HE NOT EXACTLY MY LORD
AND THAT IT HAD ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED HIM TO KEEP IN HIDING AFTER BEING LAUGHED AT AND INSULTED AND DENIED I WAS GLAD SAID THE MISERABLE WRETCH TO SEE THAT SOME OF YOU HAD SERIOUS REASON TO WISH ME BACK AGAIN IT RESTS WITH YOU MISS NAOMI TO KEEP ME HERE
EF YE DIDN'T BELONG TO THET GUM TWISTED NABOB YE'D BE SOME PUN'KINS
WERE JUST GETTING RIPE HE SHOWED THE PATCH WITH MUCH PRIDE ONE DAY TO THE NIECES SAYING HERE'S THE MOST EXTRY FINE MELLING PATCH IN THIS COUNTY EF I DO SAY IT MYSELF DAN BRAYLEY HE THINKS HE KIN RAISE MELLINGS BUT THE OL FOOL AIN'T GOT A CIRCUMSTANCE TO THIS
BEFORE THAT TIME HOWEVER MARK HAD LIVED AND WORKED FOR MANY YEARS WITH THE APOSTLE PETER WHO IN HIS LETTER WRITTEN FROM BABYLON SPEAKS OF HIM AS MARCUS MY SON
FIGHT HIS BRAVEST IN VAIN DID HE SACRIFICE HIMSELF AND STRIVE TO MAKE UP FOR THE WRONG DOING OF HIS BROTHER HE FAILED UTTERLY FOR HOMER TELLS US THAT HE WAS HATED BY SOME OF THE GODS FOR NO FAULT OF HIS OWN AND SO THEY DOOMED HIM TO DESTRUCTION
HOW THOROUGHLY THESE FIRST CHRISTIANS KNEW THEIR BIBLE HOW THEY LOVED TO PICTURE ITS SCENES HAD ALL THE WRITINGS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BEEN LOST WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS OF OUR LORD'S LIFE ON EARTH FROM THESE FADED PAINTINGS AND WORN CARVINGS ALONE LOVE
NOT ONLY DID THE APOSTLE PETER WRITE A PART OF THE BIBLE BUT THAT SHORT BOOK KNOWN AS THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER IS ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED BY ALL THE EARLIEST CHRISTIAN WRITERS THOSE AUTHORS AND TEACHERS WHO HAD SEEN THE APOSTLES AND HAD HEARD FROM THEIR LIPS
WHICH IS THE MORE IMPORTANT SEVEN WHAT EFFECT DOES CONFIDENCE ON THE PART OF THE SPEAKER HAVE ON THE AUDIENCE EIGHT WRITE OUT A TWO MINUTE SPEECH ON CONFIDENCE AND COWARDICE NINE
PAUL WAS SO GRIEVED AT HIS FAILURE
THE WRITER OF THE GOSPEL WHICH COMES THE FIRST IN OUR NEW TESTAMENT WAS A LEVITE THAT IS HE BELONGED TO THE TRIBE OF LEVI AND THIS TRIBE WAS SPECIALLY CHOSEN IN THE TIME OF MOSES TO LEARN THE LAW AND SERVE GOD IN HIS TEMPLE
HUMILITY IS NOT THE PERSONAL DISCOUNT THAT WE MUST OFFER IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS AGAINST THIS OLD INTERPRETATION THERE HAS BEEN A MOST HEALTHY MODERN REACTION TRUE HUMILITY ANY MAN WHO THOROUGHLY KNOWS HIMSELF MUST FEEL
IN JOHN'S LATTER DAYS AND EVERY SENTENCE IN THEM SEEMS TO BREATHE FORTH THE PEACE LOVE AND WISDOM OF A VERY OLD MAN WHO HAS LIVED CLOSE TO CHRIST FOR MANY YEARS IT MAY WELL BE THEN THAT THESE CALM AND LOVING LETTERS WERE THE LAST OF ALL THE BIBLE WORDS TO BE WRITTEN
ABOVE ALL THE STORY OF OUR SAVIOUR'S ASCENSION INTO HEAVEN AND THE MARVELLOUS FULFILMENT OF HIS PROMISES IN THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AT PENTECOST WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT UNTOLD THE BOOK OF THE ACTS STANDS ALONE THERE ARE FOUR GOSPELS
BUT BARNABAS WHO BELIEVED IN HIS REPENTANCE GAVE HIM ANOTHER TRIAL
STUDENTS OF PUBLIC SPEAKING CONTINUALLY ASK HOW CAN I OVERCOME SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE FEAR THAT PARALYZES ME BEFORE AN AUDIENCE DID YOU EVER NOTICE IN LOOKING FROM A TRAIN WINDOW THAT SOME HORSES FEED NEAR THE TRACK AND NEVER EVEN PAUSE TO LOOK UP AT THE THUNDERING CARS
THAT IS IN PEACE FOR ALL THIS GREAT UNDERGROUND CITY IS IN REALITY ONE HUGE CEMETERY THE QUIET RESTING PLACE WHERE THE FIRST CHRISTIANS OF HEATHEN ROME BURIED THEIR DEAD WHERE THE MARTYRED BODIES SO CRUELLY TORTURED BY NERO WERE LAID AT LAST
THE WATER IS FINE IN FACT HAVING SPOKEN A FEW TIMES YOU WILL EVEN ANTICIPATE THE PLUNGE WITH EXHILARATION TO STAND BEFORE AN AUDIENCE AND MAKE THEM THINK YOUR THOUGHTS AFTER YOU IS ONE OF THE GREATEST PLEASURES YOU CAN EVER KNOW
THE SAVIOUR HAD ONCE TOLD PETER THAT HE MUST FORGIVE HIS BROTHER ALTHOUGH HE WAS WRONGED BY HIM ON SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN OCCASIONS
HAVE THE FIRST FEW SENTENCES WORKED OUT COMPLETELY SO THAT YOU MAY NOT BE TROUBLED IN THE BEGINNING TO FIND WORDS KNOW YOUR SUBJECT BETTER THAN YOUR HEARERS KNOW IT AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR AFTER PREPARING FOR SUCCESS EXPECT IT
THEIR LITTLE OIL LAMPS TWINKLING LIKE STARS AND THERE THEY LISTENED TO THE WORD OF GOD AND PRAYED AND SANG TOGETHER MANY TOUCHING STORIES ARE TOLD OF THESE DAYS AND OF THE MEETINGS HELD UNDERGROUND IN THESE CATACOMBS WHERE THE LIVING WERE SURROUNDED BY THE BODIES OF THE MARTYRED DEAD
GIVE A THREE MINUTE TALK ON STAGE FRIGHT
AND SHOWED THE RESULTS WHICH OUR SAVIOUR'S LIFE AND DEATH AND RESURRECTION PRODUCED AT ONCE IN THE WORLD THE MARVELLOUS ACCURACY OF SAINT LUKE AND HIS KEEN OBSERVATION BECOME EVERY YEAR MORE STRIKING AS FRESH DISCOVERIES IN THE LANDS OF WHICH HE WROTE
EIGHT CHARITY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED LOVE THEN THE LORD HAD WARNED PETER THAT SATAN HAD DESIRED TO HAVE HIM AND HE REMEMBERING THAT SOLEMN FACT IN HIS OWN LIFE TRIED TO PUT HIS READERS ON THEIR GUARD AGAINST THE GREAT ENEMY
IT IS IN JOHN'S GOSPEL THAT WE LEARN MOST ABOUT THE LOVE OF CHRIST
MILES AND MILES OF PASSAGES ARE THERE SOME LOW AND NARROW OTHERS WIDE AND LOFTY THEY CROSS AND RE CROSS EACH OTHER LIKE THE STREETS OF A TOWN AND ALL ARE SCOOPED OUT OF THE SOLID EARTH
AND BESIDES BEING HIGHLY EDUCATED AND GIFTED HE TOOK INFINITE PAINS WITH HIS WORK HE COLLECTED ALL THE INFORMATION HE COULD BOTH FROM BOOKS AND EYE WITNESSES EITHER FROM THE SAVIOUR'S MOTHER HERSELF OR FROM SOME OF HER RELATIONS
DANIEL WEBSTER FAILED IN HIS FIRST APPEARANCE AND HAD TO TAKE HIS SEAT WITHOUT FINISHING HIS SPEECH BECAUSE HE WAS NERVOUS
CHAPTER ONE ACQUIRING CONFIDENCE BEFORE AN AUDIENCE THERE IS A STRANGE SENSATION OFTEN EXPERIENCED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN AUDIENCE IT MAY PROCEED FROM THE GAZE OF THE MANY EYES THAT TURN UPON THE SPEAKER
BUT THE FISHERMAN WAS TO RECEIVE HIS EDUCATION IN A VERY DIFFERENT FASHION FROM LUKE
EVERY HEATHEN ROMAN HAD HIS HOUSE DECORATED WITH PICTURES AND CARVINGS FROM HIS PAGAN RELIGION BUT IT WAS IN THE DIM UNDERGROUND GALLERIES THAT THE FIRST BIBLE PICTURES APPEARED SOME OF THE SUBJECTS WERE TAKEN FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT SOME FROM THE NEW
IF WHEN YE BE BUFFETED FOR YOUR FAULTS YE SHALL TAKE IT PATIENTLY BUT IF WHEN YE DO WELL AND SUFFER FOR IT YE TAKE IT PATIENTLY THIS IS ACCEPTABLE WITH GOD BECAUSE CHRIST ALSO SUFFERED FOR US LEAVING US AN EXAMPLE
THE HIGHER WE GO IN THE SCALE OF LIFE THE GREATER IS THE CAPACITY FOR SUFFERING FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER SOME MASTER SPEAKERS NEVER ENTIRELY OVERCOME STAGE FRIGHT BUT IT WILL PAY YOU TO SPARE NO PAINS TO CONQUER IT
THIS IS THE WONDERFUL MESSAGE WHICH GOD GAVE TO THE WORLD THROUGH MATTHEW'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT SCRIPTURES YEARS PASSED AND THOSE WHO HAD SEEN CHRIST IN HIS EARTHLY LIFE HAD NEARLY ALL DIED
FIVE HOW DOES MODERATE EXCITEMENT AFFECT YOU SIX WHAT ARE THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL REQUISITES FOR THE ACQUIRING OF SELF CONFIDENCE
THE NEXT THING I MUST FIND SAID THE MUNCHKIN BOY IS A GILL OF WATER FROM A DARK WELL INDEED WELL THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT SAID THE SHAGGY MAN SCRATCHING HIS LEFT EAR IN A PUZZLED WAY
THE VELVET BREECHES HAD JEWELED BUCKLES AT THE KNEES AND SHAGS ALL AROUND THE BOTTOMS ON HIS BREAST HUNG A MEDALLION BEARING A PICTURE OF PRINCESS DOROTHY OF OZ AND IN HIS HAND AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT OJO WAS A SHARP KNIFE SHAPED LIKE A DAGGER
PROTESTED THE SHAGGY MAN MAY BE ANSWERED THE WOOZY
A WOOZY AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST
WITH THIS SHE RAN UP THE PATH SKIPPING AND DANCING AND THEN TURNED TO AWAIT THEM IT IS QUITE A DISTANCE FROM HERE TO THE EMERALD CITY REMARKED THE SHAGGY MAN SO WE SHALL NOT GET THERE TO DAY NOR TO MORROW THEREFORE
I DON'T DOUBT IT RETURNED THE SHAGGY MAN ADMIRINGLY
SAID THE WOOZY SO THE SHAGGY MAN TRIED IT BUT PULL AS HARD AS HE COULD HE FAILED TO GET THE HAIRS OUT OF THE WOOZY'S TAIL SO HE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND WIPED HIS SHAGGY FACE WITH A SHAGGY SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER
FOR THAT YOU MUST GO TO THE WINKIE COUNTRY THE SHAGGY MAN DECLARED I'VE NEVER NOTICED ANY BUTTERFLIES THERE BUT THAT IS THE YELLOW COUNTRY OF OZ AND IT'S RULED BY A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE
AND THE NOVELTY OF THE SCENE DREW OUR TRAVELERS CLOSE TO THE LINE OF PLANTS WHERE THEY STOOD WATCHING THEM WITH RAPT INTEREST SUDDENLY A LEAF BENT LOWER THAN USUAL AND TOUCHED THE PATCHWORK GIRL SWIFTLY
WE'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY SINCE WE MET YOU SIR HE SAID I KNOW BUT A LITTLE MISERY AT TIMES MAKES ONE APPRECIATE HAPPINESS MORE TELL ME PHONY
HAVEN'T YOU ALWAYS LIVED IN THE LAND OF OZ ASKED THE MUNCHKIN BOY
THE FIRST LEAF HE CUT DOWN RELEASED SCRAPS AND ON SEEING HER THE SHAGGY MAN THREW BACK HIS SHAGGY HEAD OPENED WIDE HIS MOUTH AND LAUGHED SO SHAGGILY AND YET SO MERRILY THAT SCRAPS LIKED HIM AT ONCE
JACK PUMPKINHEAD'S A DEAR OLD CHUM WHO MIGHT BE CALLED A CHUMP
PAST THE LAST OF THE GREAT PLANTS AND NOT TILL HE WAS SAFELY BEYOND THEIR REACH DID HE CEASE HIS WHISTLING
OH WHAT LOVELY TREES THEY WERE CERTAINLY PRETTY TO LOOK UPON AND THE TRAVELERS HURRIED FORWARD TO OBSERVE THEM MORE CLOSELY
EXPLAINED THE GLASS CAT THE SHAGGY MAN LAUGHED
AND FOUND THAT A STRANGE MAN WAS STANDING BEFORE HIM A MAN SO CURIOUS IN APPEARANCE THAT THE BOY STARED WITH ROUND EYES HE WAS A BIG MAN WITH SHAGGY WHISKERS SHAGGY EYEBROWS SHAGGY HAIR
THE SHAGGY MAN SAT DOWN AGAIN AND SEEMED WELL PLEASED
THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER INQUIRINGLY BUT NO ONE COULD ANSWER SUCH A PUZZLING QUESTION FINALLY THE SHAGGY MAN SAID I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE PHONOGRAPH PLAY OJO SIGHED
IT REALLY MUST BE SOME ONE WHISTLING HE DECIDED FOR HE COULD FOLLOW THE STRAINS OF A PRETTY MUNCHKIN MELODY
MAH COAL BLACK LULU AH WANTS MAH LOO LOO LOO LOO LOO LOO LU AH LOVES MAH LULU MAH COAL BLACK LULU THERE AIN'T NOBODY ELSE LOVES LOO LOO LU HERE SHUT THAT OFF
ADVISE YOU TO PURR SOFT AND LOOK HUMBLE IF YOU CAN AND NOW I'M GOING TO BED BUNGLE CONSIDERED THE SHAGGY MAN'S ADVICE SO CAREFULLY THAT HER PINK BRAINS WERE BUSY LONG AFTER THE OTHERS OF THE PARTY
THEN IT CAN'T AMOUNT TO MUCH
BUT I CAME HERE ONCE WITH DOROTHY AND OZMA LET ME STAY
WAS THE REPLY BUT I SING LIKE A BIRD
GORGEOUS YELLOWS TURNING TO PINK PURPLE ORANGE AND SCARLET MINGLED WITH MORE SOBER BROWNS AND GRAYS EACH APPEARING AS A BLOTCH OR STRIPE ANYWHERE ON A LEAF AND THEN DISAPPEARING
WITH MY HEART RENDING GROWL MY HORRIBLE SHUDDERFUL GROWL I SHOULD SAY NOT I AM NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING DECLARED THE WOOZY I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME SIGHED OJO
ALL AROUND WAS INTENSE SILENCE OJO WONDERED IF SCRAPS HAD STOPPED SCREAMING OR IF THE FOLDS OF THE LEAF PREVENTED HIS HEARING HER BY AND BY HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A WHISTLE AS OF SOME ONE WHISTLING A TUNE YES
THEY SEEMED TO HAVE A GENERAL GROUNDWORK OF BLUE
OJO WAS SO PLEASED WITH THIS SONG THAT HE APPLAUDED THE SINGER BY CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND SCRAPS FOLLOWED SUIT BY CLAPPING HER PADDED FINGERS TOGETHER ALTHOUGH THEY MADE NO NOISE THE CAT POUNDED ON THE FLOOR WITH HER GLASS PAWS GENTLY SO AS NOT TO BREAK THEM
HAVEN'T TIME TO BE A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR SO I'LL JUST SING YOU THIS LITTLE SONG FOR YOUR OWN AMUSEMENT THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERTAINED AND LISTENED WITH INTEREST WHILE THE SHAGGY MAN CHANTED THE FOLLOWING VERSES TO A TUNE THAT WAS NOT UNPLEASANT
LEAVING HOLES THAT MIGHT CAUSE THE UNWARY TO STUMBLE I WONDER SAID OJO LOOKING UP AND DOWN THE ROAD WHICH WAY TO GO
AND HE AGREED TO GIVE US THE THREE HAIRS BUT WE COULDN'T PULL THEM OUT SO WE HAD TO BRING THE WOOZY ALONG WITH US I SEE RETURNED THE SHAGGY MAN
BUT THEY SAY THERE ARE MANY DANGERS LURKING ON THE ROAD TO THE GREAT FAIRY CITY AND SO WE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL I HOPE NOTHING WILL BREAK ME
WHEN DARKNESS CAME ON AND THEY SAT IN A CIRCLE ON THE CABIN FLOOR FACING THE FIRELIGHT THERE BEING NO FURNITURE OF ANY SORT IN THE PLACE OJO SAID TO THE SHAGGY MAN WON'T YOU TELL US A STORY I'M NOT GOOD AT STORIES
ASKED SCRAPS BETTER THAN MINE ECHOED THE GLASS CAT MINE ARE PINK AND YOU CAN SEE EM WORK WELL YOU CAN'T SEE THE SCARECROW'S BRAINS WORK
OH EXCLAIMED OJO GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE SIGHT OF THIS STRANGER AND THEN HE ADDED WHO HAS SAVED ME SIR CAN'T YOU SEE
PROOF A MAN FOR INSTANCE PETER CAN BE THE CAUSE OF PAUL'S FEELING PAIN BECAUSE HE PETER POSSESSES SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH PAUL HATES
ONE BY GOOD I MEAN THAT WHICH WE CERTAINLY KNOW TO BE USEFUL TO US TWO BY EVIL I MEAN THAT WHICH WE CERTAINLY KNOW TO BE A HINDRANCE TO US IN THE ATTAINMENT OF ANY GOOD
THAN UNDER COMPULSION FROM EXTERNAL CAUSES SHRINKS FROM FOOD OR KILLS HIMSELF WHICH LATTER MAY BE DONE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS A MAN FOR INSTANCE KILLS HIMSELF UNDER THE COMPULSION OF ANOTHER MAN WHO TWISTS ROUND HIS RIGHT HAND
AND CONSEQUENTLY SO THAT THE MIND MAY ALSO BE EQUALLY CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING MANY THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS WAY OF LIFE THEN AGREES BEST WITH OUR PRINCIPLES AND ALSO WITH GENERAL PRACTICE
FOR INASMUCH AS WE DESIRE TO FORM AN IDEA OF MAN AS A TYPE OF HUMAN NATURE WHICH WE MAY HOLD IN VIEW IT WILL BE USEFUL FOR US TO RETAIN THE TERMS IN QUESTION IN THE SENSE I HAVE INDICATED IN WHAT FOLLOWS THEN
BUT BY ACCIDENT SIX WHAT I MEAN BY EMOTION FELT TOWARDS A THING FUTURE PRESENT AND PAST
ON THE OTHER HAND GRIEF MAY BE GOOD IN SO FAR AS STIMULATION OR PLEASURE IS BAD PROOF LOCALIZED PLEASURE OR STIMULATION TITILLATIO
HE WILL ON THE OTHER HAND CALL IT PERFECT AS SOON AS HE SEES THAT IT IS CARRIED THROUGH TO THE END WHICH ITS AUTHOR HAD PURPOSED FOR IT BUT IF A MAN SEES A WORK THE LIKE WHEREOF HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND IF HE KNOWS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE ARTIFICER
WHICH NECESSARILY ASSERTS THEIR EXISTENCE OR EXCLUDES IT FOUR PARTICULAR THINGS I CALL POSSIBLE IN SO FAR AS WHILE REGARDING THE CAUSES
WE SHALL SEE THAT THE DISCREPANCY VANISHES FOR THE TWO MEN ARE NOT IN ONE ANOTHER'S WAY IN VIRTUE OF THE AGREEMENT OF THEIR NATURES THAT IS THROUGH BOTH LOVING THE SAME THING BUT IN VIRTUE OF ONE DIFFERING FROM THE OTHER
CONSIDERED AS LESS MAD FOR THEY ARE MADE OBJECTS OF RIDICULE BUT WHEN A MISER THINKS OF NOTHING BUT GAIN OR MONEY OR WHEN AN AMBITIOUS MAN THINKS OF NOTHING BUT GLORY
SEVEN BY AN END FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH WE DO SOMETHING I MEAN A DESIRE EIGHT BY VIRTUE VIRTUS AND POWER I MEAN THE SAME THING THAT IS
SAY THAT SOME ARE MORE PERFECT THAN OTHERS AGAIN IN SO FAR AS WE ATTRIBUTE TO THEM ANYTHING IMPLYING NEGATION AS TERM END INFIRMITY ET CETERA WE TO THIS EXTENT CALL THEM IMPERFECT
THEREFORE IF THERE BE ANY QUESTION OF ANOTHER PLAN THE PLAN WE HAVE MENTIONED IS THE BEST AND IN EVERY WAY TO BE COMMENDED
NOTE I SAID THAT PAUL MAY HATE PETER BECAUSE HE CONCEIVES THAT PETER POSSESSES SOMETHING WHICH HE PAUL
FOR NO GIVEN THING CAN BE SAID TO BE MORE PERFECT BECAUSE IT HAS PASSED A LONGER TIME IN EXISTENCE THE DURATION OF THINGS CANNOT BE DETERMINED BY THEIR ESSENCE FOR THE ESSENCE OF THINGS INVOLVES NO FIXED AND DEFINITE PERIOD OF EXISTENCE BUT EVERYTHING
WHY IT IS THAT THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL STIRS UP CONFLICTS IN THE SOUL AND OFTEN YIELDS TO EVERY KIND OF PASSION
IS OF UNIVERSAL APPLICATION WHEREFORE DESIRE ARISING FROM SUCH KNOWLEDGE WHEN CONCERNED WITH THE FUTURE CAN BE MORE EASILY CONTROLLED OR QUENCHED
VIRTUE IS HUMAN POWER WHICH IS DEFINED SOLELY BY MAN'S ESSENCE
THAT BY THE SAME NECESSITY OF ITS NATURE WHEREBY IT EXISTS IT LIKEWISE WORKS
HE PLAINLY CANNOT KNOW WHETHER THAT WORK BE PERFECT OR IMPERFECT SUCH SEEMS TO BE THE PRIMARY MEANING OF THESE TERMS BUT AFTER MEN BEGAN TO FORM GENERAL IDEAS
AGAIN AS VIRTUE IS NOTHING ELSE BUT ACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF ONE'S OWN NATURE
ARE MORE PERFECT OR MORE IMPERFECT IN PROPORTION AS THEY APPROACH MORE OR LESS NEARLY TO THE SAID TYPE FOR IT MUST BE SPECIALLY REMARKED THAT WHEN I SAY THAT A MAN PASSES FROM A LESSER TO A GREATER PERFECTION OR VICE VERSA
NECESSARILY DO ONLY SUCH THINGS
IS BY THE FACT OF PAIN BEING FELT DIMINISHED OR HINDERED HENCE THE FORCE OF DESIRE ARISING FROM PLEASURE MUST BE DEFINED
AS TYPES BEFORE HERSELF THEREFORE WHEN THEY BEHOLD SOMETHING IN NATURE WHICH DOES NOT WHOLLY CONFORM TO THE PRECONCEIVED TYPE WHICH THEY HAVE FORMED OF THE THING IN QUESTION THEY SAY THAT NATURE HAS FALLEN SHORT OR HAS BLUNDERED AND HAS LEFT HER WORK INCOMPLETE
THAT SUICIDES ARE WEAK MINDED AND ARE OVERCOME BY EXTERNAL CAUSES REPUGNANT TO THEIR NATURE
THEREFORE IN SO FAR AS A THING IS IN HARMONY WITH OUR NATURE IT IS NECESSARILY GOOD
THAT BY REALITY AND PERFECTION I MEAN THE SAME THING FOR WE ARE WONT TO REFER ALL THE INDIVIDUAL THINGS IN NATURE TO ONE GENUS WHICH IS CALLED THE HIGHEST GENUS NAMELY TO THE CATEGORY OF BEING
CANNOT BE EXPLAINED SOLELY THROUGH OUR ESSENCE OR NATURE
WHICH OF THE EMOTIONS ARE IN HARMONY WITH THE RULES OF HUMAN REASON
CONCERNING THESE TERMS SEE THE FOREGOING PREFACE TOWARDS THE END THREE PARTICULAR THINGS I CALL CONTINGENT IN SO FAR AS WHILE REGARDING THEIR ESSENCE ONLY WE FIND NOTHING THEREIN
BY CONFLICTING EMOTIONS I MEAN THOSE WHICH DRAW A MAN IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THOUGH THEY ARE OF THE SAME KIND SUCH AS LUXURY AND AVARICE WHICH ARE BOTH SPECIES OF LOVE AND ARE CONTRARIES NOT BY NATURE
NOTE NO ONE THEREFORE NEGLECTS SEEKING HIS OWN GOOD OR PRESERVING HIS OWN BEING UNLESS HE BE OVERCOME BY CAUSES EXTERNAL AND FOREIGN TO HIS NATURE NO ONE I SAY FROM THE NECESSITY OF HIS OWN NATURE OR OTHERWISE
SHE GOT FANNY UP INTO HER OWN DEN ONE AFTERNOON AND SEATED HER DISCREETLY IN AN EASY ARM CHAIR MAKING HER GUEST TAKE OFF HER BONNET AND SHOWING BY VARIOUS SIGNS THAT THE VISIT WAS REGARDED AS ONE OF GREAT MOMENT FANNY SHE SAID
THEY WALKED ON IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO TILL THEY REACHED THE PARSONAGE GATE AND THEN LUCY SAID LAUGHING CAN'T YOU FANCY ME SITTING ON THAT GREAT BIG HORSE
IF LUCY WOULD PERSIST IN SECURING TO HERSELF SO MUCH OF LORD LUFTON'S TIME AND ATTENTION HER VISITS TO FRAMLEY COURT MUST BECOME LESS FREQUENT LADY LUFTON WOULD DO MUCH VERY MUCH INDEED FOR HER FRIENDS AT THE PARSONAGE
WHY DIDN'T SHE LABEL HIM DANGEROUS IN TIME AND THEN THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND UP TO THEIR OWN ROOMS IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ANY ONE TO UNDERSTAND LUCY'S STATE OF MIND AT PRESENT AND IT CAN HARDLY BE SAID THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD IT HERSELF
BUT IT WAS NOT QUITE SO EASY TO SAY WHAT LUDOVIC MIGHT DO OR THINK BUT LADY LUFTON WENT ON I AM SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ME FANNY WITH YOUR EXCELLENT SENSE AND TACT LUCY IS CLEVER AND AMUSING AND ALL THAT
FOR FEAR HE SHOULD BE SWALLOWED IN MISTAKE YOU WILL BE SAFE YOU SEE SAID FANNY LAUGHING AS YOU HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY CAUTIONED AS TO THIS INDIVIDUAL BOTTLE AH
CHAPTER THIRTEEN DELICATE HINTS LADY LUFTON HAD BEEN GREATLY REJOICED AT THAT GOOD DEED WHICH HER SON DID IN GIVING UP HIS LEICESTERSHIRE HUNTING AND COMING TO RESIDE FOR THE WINTER AT FRAMLEY IT WAS PROPER AND BECOMING
LORD LUFTON WANTS ME TO LEARN TO RIDE SAID SHE
MISSUS ROBARTS AS SHE SAW THEM COULD NOT BUT OWN THAT THERE MIGHT BE CAUSE FOR LADY LUFTON'S FEARS BUT THEN LUCY'S MANNER AS MISSUS ROBARTS APPROACHED WAS CALCULATED TO DISSIPATE ANY SUCH FEARS
AFTER I HAVE HAD SO MANY DOSES IT IS NO GOOD TELLING ME ABOUT IT NOW WHEN THE MISCHIEF IS DONE
DID FORBID LUCY ROBARTS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH LORD LUFTON BUT HER DOUBTS ON THIS SUBJECT IF SHE HELD ANY WERE NOT COMMUNICATED TO HER LADYSHIP IT HAD NEVER ENTERED INTO HER MIND
AND TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS NO GROUND FOR THEM SHE DID NOT MOVE FROM HER POSITION OR ALLOW HER HAND TO DROP OR SHOW THAT SHE WAS IN ANY WAY EITHER CONFUSED OR CONSCIOUS SHE STOOD HER GROUND
TOO MUCH FRIGHTENED AND LASTLY IT IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR A GREAT MANY OTHER VERY GOOD REASONS NONSENSE SAID LORD LUFTON A GREAT DEAL OF NONSENSE SAID LUCY LAUGHING BUT ALL OF IT OF LORD LUFTON'S TALKING
AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WITH A PRUDENCE EQUAL TO HER GENEROSITY FELT THAT SHE COULD AFFORD TO BE SUBMISSIVE IT MIGHT PERHAPS NOT BE LONG BEFORE SHE WOULD BE EQUALLY ANXIOUS TO CONQUER AGAIN
BUT NEVERTHELESS THE HOUSE WAS MORE JOYOUS TO HER WHEN HE WAS THERE THERE WAS A REASON FOR SOME LITTLE GAIETY WHICH WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED THITHER BY HERSELF BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE DID ENJOY WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY HIS PRESENCE
AND WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT SHE HAD FELT THE AIR OF THE WHOLE PLACE TO BE VERY COLD BEFORE HER INTIMACY WITH HIM AND NOW IT MUST BE COLD AGAIN TWO HOMES HAD BEEN OPEN TO HER FRAMLEY COURT AND THE PARSONAGE
AND COMFORTABLE IN THE EXTREME AN ENGLISH NOBLEMAN OUGHT TO HUNT IN THE COUNTY WHERE HE HIMSELF OWNS THE FIELDS OVER WHICH HE RIDES HE OUGHT TO RECEIVE THE RESPECT AND HONOUR DUE TO HIM FROM HIS OWN TENANTS HE OUGHT TO SLEEP UNDER A ROOF OF HIS OWN
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GENTLEMAN IS VERY RICH AND A LORD AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING NOBODY FOR A MOMENT ATTRIBUTES ANYTHING WRONG TO YOU LUCY ANYTHING WRONG NO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD BE ANYTHING WRONG EVEN IF I WERE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM
NEARLY OPPOSITE TO PODGENS SHOP SHE SAW LORD LUFTON ON HORSEBACK AND LUCY STANDING BESIDE HIM IT WAS ALREADY NEARLY FIVE O'CLOCK AND IT WAS GETTING DUSK BUT AS SHE APPROACHED OR RATHER
WAS THE PERFECTLY COLLECTED MANNER IN WHICH LUCY SPOKE AND CONDUCTED HERSELF THIS CONNECTED AS SHE COULD NOT BUT CONNECT IT WITH THE AIR OF CHAGRIN WITH WHICH LORD LUFTON RECEIVED LUCY'S DECISION MADE IT MANIFEST TO MISSUS ROBARTS
LET IT BE EVER SO SLIGHT WOULD BRING HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES AND THEN IT MIGHT BE A QUESTION WHETHER YOU COULD GET HIM ANOTHER MILE THAT DAY SO THAT ON THE WHOLE LADY LUFTON THOUGHT THAT THE OTHER PLAN WOULD BE THE BEST I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT LADY LUFTON WAS RIGHT
JUST EXPLAIN TO HER THAT ANY YOUNG LADY WHO TALKS SO MUCH TO THE SAME YOUNG GENTLEMAN WILL CERTAINLY BE OBSERVED THAT PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE HER OF SETTING HER CAP AT LORD LUFTON NOT THAT I SUSPECT HER I GIVE HER CREDIT FOR TOO MUCH PROPER FEELING
AND LADY LUFTON HAS BEEN ASKING YOU TO LECTURE ME ABOUT IT POOR MISSUS ROBARTS HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY SHE THOUGHT WELL OF ALL THE PERSONS CONCERNED AND WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO BEHAVE WELL BY ALL OF THEM
NOW FANNY YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALL LIKED YOUR SISTER IN LAW LUCY VERY MUCH
YOU MANAGE EVERYTHING SO PERFECTLY SAID LADY LUFTON AS SHE PRESSED MISSUS ROBARTS HAND THAT I AM QUITE AT EASE NOW THAT I FIND YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME MISSUS ROBARTS DID NOT EXACTLY AGREE WITH HER LADYSHIP
AND THEN LADY LUFTON PAUSED FOR A MOMENT FOR SHE ELOQUENT AND DISCREET AS SHE ALWAYS WAS FELT HERSELF RATHER AT A LOSS FOR WORDS TO EXPRESS HER EXACT MEANING I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO WITHOUT HER SAID FANNY
SPEAKING WITH THE OBJECT OF ASSISTING HER LADYSHIP IN HER EMBARRASSMENT BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS SHE AND LORD LUFTON ARE GETTING INTO THE WAY OF BEING TOO MUCH TOGETHER OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER TOO EXCLUSIVELY
I WONDER WHETHER THEY CAUTIONED GRISELDA GRANTLY WHEN SHE WAS HERE I SUPPOSE WHEN YOUNG LORDS GO ABOUT ALL THE GIRLS ARE CAUTIONED AS A MATTER OF COURSE
AND LUDOVIC LIKE ALL YOUNG MEN IS PERHAPS IGNORANT THAT HIS ATTENTIONS MAY BE TAKEN TO MEAN MORE THAN HE INTENDS
HE MADE A LITTLE UPWARD MOVEMENT OF HIS HAND IT WAS A GIN AND BITTERS MARSDEN ASSUMED HE MIGHT HAVE ROMARIN ORDERED IT HE HIMSELF DID NOT TAKE ONE MARSDEN TOSSED DOWN THE APERITIF AT ONE GULP
EH HE SAID I SAY ROMARIN DON'T LET'S GO GRAVE DIGGING AMONG MEMORIES MERELY FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING CONVERSATION
AND THE UNFAMILIAR NEW FRONT OF THE LITTLE RESTAURANT HE WAS PASSING AND REPASSING TOOK ON ITS OLD AND WELL KNOWN ASPECT AGAIN SEVEN O'CLOCK HE HAD THOUGHT IN DISMISSING HIS HANSOM
I MUST GO AND TELL PETER ABOUT IT AND I'LL SEND UP
WITH ALWAYS THE SUSPICION NOT FAR AWAY THAT YOU DID THINGS MORE FROM THEORETICAL CONVICTION THAN REAL IMPULSE AFTER ALL
YET IF MARSDEN DID NOT WISH TO TALK IT WAS DIFFICULT NOT TO DEFER TO HIS WISH
NOW THAT HIS EYES RESTED ON THEM AGAIN THE SHAPE OF A DOORKNOCKER THE GROUPING OF AN OLD CHIMNEY STACK THE CRACK STILL THERE IN A FLAGSTONE SOMEWHERE DEEP IN THE PAST THESE THINGS HAD ASSOCIATIONS
IN THAT MOMENT ROMARIN'S ACCIDENT BEFELL HIM
ROMARIN WAS PASSING THE RESTAURANT AGAIN THAT THERE HAD BEEN THAT QUICK BLOW ABOUT A GIRL
HE SAID THANKS SAID ROMARIN INSTANTLY NOTING THAT THE MONOSYLLABLE WHICH MATCHED THE OTHER'S IN CURTNESS WAS NOT AT ALL THE REPLY HE HAD INTENDED THANK YOU YOURS HE AMENDED
SHE WHEELED A SMALL TABLE UP TO HER VISITOR'S SIDE AND SAID VERY KINDLY NOW TAKE A BITE MY DEAR
IT'S A REAL HANDSOME PLACE
LAWFUL HEART
POOR LOU
I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE ANOTHER DRINK IN PEACE AND QUIETNESS WAITER
THIS IS RATHER A MISTAKE ROMARIN RATHER A MISTAKE HE SAID WHAT IS
I NEVER LIKED HER MYSELF ADMITTED MISSUS STAPP SHE THOUGHT HERSELF ABOVE US ALL WELL FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE SHE WAS BUT SHE NEEDN'T HAVE RUBBED IT IN SO WELL SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABOVE ME
ITS INSIDE WAS ENTIRELY NEW ITS CHEAP GLITTERING WALL MIRRORS THAT GAVE A FALSE IMPRESSION OF THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PLACE ITS LOVES AND SHEPHERDESSES PAINTED IN THE STYLE OF THE CARTS OF THE VENDORS OF ICE CREAM
SAID MARSDEN A LONG NO THAT SEEMED TO DELIBERATE TO EXAMINE AND FINALLY TO ADMIT
BUT MARSDEN'S PROMPT POINTING OUT OF THIS WAS NOT ENCOURAGING NOW THAT HE CAME TO THINK OF IT
I GATHER FROM WHAT MISSUS JOEL SAID
THE NOTING IN DETAIL OF THE LITTLE THINGS OF THE STREET THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN WITH SUCH COMPLETENESS
THEODOSIA GAVE A STIFLED GASP OF AMAZEMENT BUT MISSUS MARCH WENT SERENELY ON
AND AS THE CLOCK A STREET OR TWO AWAY HAD STRUCK SEVEN HE HAD STOOD HIS HANDS FOLDED ON HIS STICK FIRST CURIOUS THEN EXPECTANT
BUT MISSUS KENT DECLINED I'VE GOT TO HURRY HOME STRAIGHT OFF AND GET THE MEN'S SUPPERS SUCH A SCAMPER TO HAVE OVER THAT WOMAN I'M SURE I'M THANKFUL YOU'RE WILLING TO LET HER STAY FOR SHE'D NEVER BE CONTENTED ANYWHERE ELSE
AND IF YOU'RE NOT WET TO THE SKIN
BUT SHE WASN'T ABOVE TWITTING AND SNUBBING ME EVERY CHANCE SHE GOT
REGARDLESS OF INCONVENIENCE TO OTHERS BUT DOUBTLESS HE HAD HAD TO WALK IF ALL REPORTS WERE TRUE MARSDEN
AND WAS ALREADY MIXING HIMSELF ANOTHER STIFF PEG WELL HE SAID SINCE YOU WILL HAVE IT SO TO THE OLD DAYS TO THE OLD DAYS SAID ROMARIN
HE WAS A HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW AND LOU HAD A LIKING FOR HIM SO ALL THE GIRLS SAID BUT HE NEVER LOOKED AT HER THAT NIGHT AND HE KEPT BY ME THE WHOLE TIME IT MADE LOU FURIOUS AND AT LAST
MARSDEN'S VOICE AT LEAST HAD NOT CHANGED IT WAS AS IN THE OLD DAYS A LITTLE ENVIOUS SARCASTIC ACCEPTING LOWER INTERPRETATIONS SOMEWHAT WILLINGLY SOMEWHAT GRUDGING OF BETTER ONES
HE WAS ALREADY WITHIN HALF A DOZEN YARDS OF THE MEN WHO WERE MOVING THE SCENERY FROM THE THEATRE INTO THE TUMBRIL AND ONE OF THE WORKMEN PUT UP HIS HAND AS THE EDGE OF A FRESH WING APPEARED
THAT ROMANTIC SOAP BUBBLE OF YOURS WAS REALLY AT THE BOTTOM OF IT I SUSPECT TELL ME HE SMILED DID YOU REALLY SUPPOSE LIFE COULD BE LIVED ON THOSE MAD LINES YOU USED TO LAY DOWN
THE POINT WAS THAT THE CONVERSATION HAD BEGUN NOT VERY HAPPILY AND MUST BE MENDED AT ONCE IF AT ALL TO MEND IT ROMARIN LEANED ACROSS THE TABLE BE AS FRIENDLY AS I AM MARSDEN HE SAID I THINK
SHE SAID WITH A FEEBLE ATTEMPT AT DIGNITY I AM MISSUS BAXTER I
AND ALL JUST THE SAME AS IT USED TO BE I GUESS SHE IS A SIGHT OF TROUBLE AND MISSUS JOEL AIN'T THE WOMAN TO LIKE THAT BUT THERE SHE HAS TO WORK MOST AWFUL HARD
WINTER IS REAL PLEASANT WHEN IT DOES COME BUT I MUST SAY I DON'T FANCY THESE BETWIXT AND BETWEEN DAYS MUCH
BUT WHETHER CHARLES DID SAIL IN THE HELEN RAY OR
AND SO THIS IS YOUR REVENGE ANNA MARCH SAID THE LATTER SOLEMNLY DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME ABOUT HER YES I DO THEODOSIA AND I THOUGHT I MEANT EVERY WORD OF IT BUT I GUESS MY WICKED STREAK
YOU DIDN'T ALTOGETHER DISLIKE I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME THINK WHAT IT WAS BY THE WAY AND YOU WANT TO LAY STRESS ON THAT AND TO SINK THE REST WELL YOU CAN'T I WON'T LET YOU I'LL NOT SUBMIT MY LIFE TO YOU LIKE THAT
HE HAD NOT FORTY YEARS AGO BEEN THE FAMOUS PAINTER HONOURED DECORATED TAKEN BY THE ARM BY MONARCHS
JUST PICK OUT ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLANTS AND FLOWERS YOU CAN FIND ROUND US HERE HOW MANY DO YOU THINK THERE ARE OH THERE SEEM TO BE FOUR OR FIVE
LADY WHY AND MADAM HOW LIKEWISE WILL SURELY AVENGE THE WRONGS OF THEIR HUMAN SISTER THERE YOU DO NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND I DO NOT CARE THAT YOU SHOULD
LIKE ALL LADY WHY'S MESSAGES IS AT HEART A MERCIFUL AND LOVING ONE
AND A LITTLE STITCHWORT AND PIGNUT AND MOUSE EAR HAWKWEED TOO WHICH NOBODY WANTS WHY
AND MANY OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AND THEN THEY SAVED THE SEEDS OF THOSE FATTENING WILD GRASSES AND SOWED THEM IN FRESH SPOTS OFTEN THEY MADE MISTAKES THEY WERE CARELESS AND GOT WEEDS AMONG THE SEED
YOU MUST LEARN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THINGS BEFORE YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW THOSE DIFFERENCES CAME ABOUT YOU MUST LEARN MADAM HOW'S ALPHABET BEFORE YOU CAN READ HER BOOK AND MADAM HOW'S ALPHABET OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS IS SPECIES
SOMETHING VERY LIKE WHAT THE BIBLE CALLS TEMPTING GOD STAKING THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR LIVES UPON THE CHANCES OF NO EARTHQUAKES COMING WHILE THEY OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT AN EARTHQUAKE MIGHT COME ANY DAY THEY HAVE FULFILLED
AND OVER THE TROPIC SEAS DOWN TO THE EQUATOR AND THE PALM GROVES OF THE ETERNAL SUMMER IF WE CANNOT FIND SOMETHING EVEN AT STARTING FROM THE OPEN DOOR TO TEACH US ABOUT WHY AND HOW
YES THEN THEY SPOKE EXACT TRUTH WHAT WILL THAT HAY TURN INTO BY CHRISTMAS CAN'T YOU TELL INTO MILK OF COURSE WHICH YOU WILL DRINK AND INTO HORSEFLESH TOO WHICH YOU WILL USE
THOUGH THE MACHINE HAS CUT OFF ALL THE GRASS WHICH SHE HAS BEEN MAKING FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS FOR AS FAST AS WE SHEAR IT OFF SHE MAKES IT GROW AGAIN THERE ARE FRESH BLADES HERE AT OUR FEET A FULL INCH LONG
A LIVE MANURE CART YES CHILD IF YOU HAD SEEN AS I HAVE SEEN IN FOREIGN LANDS POOR WOMEN HAGGARD DIRTY GROWN OLD BEFORE THEIR YOUTH WAS OVER
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY I WAS TRAVELLING IN THE PYRENEES AND I CAME ONE EVENING TO THE LOVELIEST SPOT A GLEN OR RATHER A VAST CRACK IN THE MOUNTAINS SO NARROW THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR ANYTHING AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
THAT WE MAY GUESS AT SOMETHING LIKE A GOOD REASON FOR THE TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKES IN SOUTH AMERICA I DO NOT WISH TO BE HARD UPON POOR PEOPLE IN GREAT AFFLICTION BUT I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PAST
AND CUTTING IT BETTER TOO FOR THE MOWING MACHINE GOES SO MUCH NEARER TO THE GROUND THAN THE SCYTHE THAT WE GAIN BY IT TWO HUNDREDWEIGHT OF HAY ON EVERY ACRE AND SEE TOO HOW PERSEVERING OLD MADAM HOW WILL NOT STOP HER WORK
WELL AND THIS HAY FIELD IS A MANUFACTORY
AND THAT HAY AND CORN MUST BE PUT BACK AGAIN INTO THE LAND BY MANURE
IT ONLY BECOMES STRONG BY BEING TURNED INTO GAS AND STEAM BUT STEAM IS ALWAYS STRONG AND IF YOU LOOK AT A RAILWAY ENGINE STILL MORE IF YOU HAD EVER SEEN WHICH GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD A BOILER EXPLOSION
THERE IS A PROOF TO US OF WHAT MEN MAY DO IF THEY WILL ONLY LEARN THE LESSONS WHICH MADAM HOW CAN TEACH THEM THERE IS THAT BOY FRESH FROM THE NATIONAL SCHOOL CUTTING MORE GRASS IN A DAY THAN SIX STRONG MOWERS COULD HAVE CUT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOOK OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY FENCE AT THE MOORS AND WOODS THEY ARE FOREST WILD WALD AS THE GERMANS WOULD CALL IT INSIDE THE FENCE IS FIELD FELD AS THE GERMANS WOULD CALL IT
AND THE BROWN SOIL ONLY GOES UP TO IT WELL THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE COMMON SENSE NOW YOU WILL NOT SAY ANY MORE AS THE COWS OR THE BUTTERFLIES MIGHT THAT THE HAY FIELD WAS ALWAYS THERE
THAT HE DID NOT INTEND US TO LIVE IN HIS HOUSE ANY LONGER IF HE COULD HELP IT AND WAS GIVING US IN A VERY ROUGH FASHION NOTICE TO QUIT
OUT OF EACH OF WHICH POURED IN FOAMING WATERFALLS STREAMS LARGE ENOUGH TO TURN A MILL AND ABOVE THEM MOUNTAINS PILED ON MOUNTAINS
FOR ONE CANNOT EAT ONE'S CAKE AND KEEP IT TOO AND NO MORE CAN ONE EAT ONE'S GRASS SO THIS FIELD IS A TRULY WONDERFUL PLACE IT IS NO UGLY PILE OF BRICK AND MORTAR
BUT REMEMBER THIS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPINESS IS THEN IF YOU WISH TO PLEASE LADY WHY AND LADY WHY'S LORD AND KING LIKEWISE YOU WILL NEVER PASS A LITTLE CHILD WITHOUT TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPIER EVEN BY A PASSING SMILE
AND SO IT WAS WITH ME I DREAMED THAT SOME ENGLISH PEOPLE HAD COME INTO THE HOTEL WHERE I WAS AND WERE SLEEPING IN THE ROOM UNDERNEATH ME AND THAT THEY HAD QUARRELLED AND FOUGHT AND BROKE THEIR BED DOWN WITH A TREMENDOUS CRASH
YES WELL THEN DO RICH GRASSES COME UP ON THEM NOW THAT THEY ARE BROKEN UP OH NO NOTHING BUT GROUNDSEL AND A FEW WEEDS
WHY SHOULD THERE NOT HAVE BEEN ONLY ONE SORT OF BUTTERFLY AND HE ONLY OF ONE COLOUR A PLAIN BROWN OR A PLAIN WHITE AND WHY SHOULD THERE BE SO MANY SORTS OF BIRDS ALL ROBBING THE GARDEN AT ONCE
BECOME A GREAT RICH AND HAPPY NATION INSTEAD OF THE IDLE AND USELESS
IF PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY ENOUGH THEY ARE OFTEN TEMPTED TO DO MANY WRONG DEEDS AND TO THINK MANY WRONG THOUGHTS AND IF BY GOD'S GRACE THEY KNOW THE LAWS OF LADY WHY AND KEEP FROM SIN STILL
IS STEAM HAS DONE BOTH THE LID OF THE KETTLE RATTLES BECAUSE THE EXPANDING STEAM ESCAPES IN LITTLE JETS AND SO CAUSES A LID QUAKE NOW SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS STEAM UNDER THE EARTH TRYING TO ESCAPE
SO THE BOYS LEFT THE WATER AND PREPARED TO MEET THEIR OLD FRIENDS I HOPE JACK HOPKINS COMES SAID BERT FOR JACK WAS A GREAT FRIEND OH HE WILL BE ALONG HARRY REMARKED NOBODY LIKES A GOOD TIME BETTER THAN JACK HERE THEY COME ANNOUNCED HAL THE NEXT MINUTE
OF COURSE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL CAPTAIN MC KAY RETURNS BUT THE MORE QUICKLY WE GET AWAY FROM HERE THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR US I I'M SCARED AREN'T YOU STAMMERED THE FAT BOY APPREHENSIVELY NO I AM NOT SCARED
WHO HAD A GREAT REGARD FOR THINGS THAT HANG UP AND LOOK LIKE CURIOS I'LL GO ALONG AND HELP YOU MAKE THE BARGAIN WHEN THE BOYS CAME BACK THEY HAD A DOZEN OF THE FUNNY DRINKING CUPS THE LONG CROOKED HANDLES WERE SO QUEER
THE REMAINING STONES WERE QUICKLY LAID IN PLACE TAD MOTIONED FOR CHUNKY TO DESCEND THE FAT BOY LEAPED DOWN THE TREE TOP REMAINED ON THE GROUND LEAVING A WIDE OPENING IN THE ROCKS
THE CAVE THEY FOUND WAS MUCH LARGER THAN THEY HAD HAD ANY IDEA OF IN PLACES THE ROOF WAS ALL OF TEN FEET HIGH BUT AS THEY PENETRATED FURTHER IN MOVING CAUTIOUSLY LIGHTING THE WAY WITH EVERY STEP
STAMMERED HAL QUITE CONFUSED NOW NOTHING WHY I WAS ABOUT DEAD AND PULLED ON YOU WITH ALL MY TWO HUNDRED POUNDS YOU KNEW TOO YOU HAD HARDLY A CHANCE TO BRING ME UP YES INDEED I WANT YOUR NAME AND AS HE INSISTED
THE INSTANT THEY HAD CRAWLED OUT INTO THE OUTER CHAMBER THEY REALIZED THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE AT FIRST THEY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD OCCURRED TAD WAS THE FIRST TO MAKE THE DISCOVERY OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED WE'RE CAUGHT
THEN NAN FILLED HIS GOURD FROM THE DIPPER THAT STOOD IN THE BIG PAIL OF LEMONADE AND HE SMACKED HIS LIPS IN APPRECIATION THERE WAS SO MUCH TO DO AND SO MUCH TO SEE THAT THE FEW HOURS ALLOWED THE EXCURSIONISTS SLIPPED BY ALL TOO QUICKLY
AUNT SARAH TOO IS COMING ALL RIGHT THEN AGREED UNCLE DANIEL I'LL WAIT AWHILE WELL HARRY YOU LOOK LIKE AN INDIAN CAN YOU SEE THROUGH THAT COAT OF TAN HARRY LAUGHED AND SAID HE HAD BEEN AN INDIAN IN HAVING A GOOD TIME
AND WAS CATAPULTED TO THE GROUND WHICH HE STRUCK WITH A FORCE THAT MADE HIS BONES ACHE THE TWO PONY RIDER BOYS SAT UP RUBBING THEMSELVES AND LOOKING INTO EACH OTHERS FACES
I MUST GET THOSE LADS NAMES DECLARED THE MAN TO THE GUARD MINE IS AND HE GAVE THE NAME OF THE FAMOUS MILLIONAIRE WHO HAD A MAGNIFICENT SUMMER HOME IN ANOTHER COLONY THREE MILES AWAY AND YOU SWAM FROM THE CEDARS MISTER BLACK
AS A CROWD OF CHILDREN WITH MANY LUNCH BOXES CAME RUNNING DOWN TO THE OCEAN HELLO THERE HELLO THERE CALLED EVERYBODY AT ONCE FOR OF COURSE ALL THE CHILDREN KNEW HARRY AND MANY ALSO KNEW BERT THERE WERE TOM MASON JACK HOPKINS AUGUST STOUT
I I WON'T LET IT D D ROP UN UNLESS I I FALL OFF THE ROCK NEARLY GOT AWAY FROM THE FAT BOY BUTLER LEAPED BACK OUT OF THE WAY BUT STACY RECOVERED HIMSELF IN TIME AND AFTER SOME EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN PLACING THE ROCK IN THE LIMBS OF THE TREE
AND NED PRENTICE IN THE FIRST CROWD WHILE A NUMBER OF GIRLS FRIENDS OF NAN'S WERE IN ANOTHER GROUP NAN NELLIE AND DOROTHY HAD BEEN DETAINED BY SOMEBODY FURTHER UP ON THE ROAD BUT WERE NOW COMING DOWN SLOWLY SUCH A DELIGHT AS THE OCEAN WAS TO THE COUNTRY CHILDREN
ONE LITTLE SLIP MIGHT BE THE DEATH OF US FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE BE PRUDENT I'LL BE PRUDENT BUT I WISH I HAD A SANDWICH HAVE YOU LOOKED TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO EAT IN THIS HOLE NO I HAVE SOMETHING OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN FOOD TO THINK ABOUT AT PRESENT
YOU BOYS DID WELL DECLARED THE GUARD PROMPTLY SEEING HOW HARD THEY WORKED WITH THE SICK MAN YES THEY SAVED MY LIFE GASPED THE HALF DROWNED MAN THIS LITTLE FELLOW POINTING TO HAL BROUGHT ME UP ALMOST FROM
EXCLAIMED UNCLE DANIEL GIVING HIS NEPHEW A GOOD LONG HUG AND YOU HAVE TURNED INDIAN TOO WHERE'S THAT SEA SERPENT YOU WERE GOING TO CATCH FOR ME I'LL GET HIM YET DECLARED THE LITTLE FELLOW IT HASN'T RAINED HARDLY SINCE WE CAME DOWN AND THEY ONLY COME IN TO LAND OUT OF THE RAIN
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I'M GOING IN THERE I THINK PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE THE WISER PLAN FOR YOU TO REMAIN OUT HERE AND KEEP WATCH NO SIR I GUESS NOT I'VE HELPED DISCOVER THAT HOLE AND I'M GOING TO REAP MY REWARD BY EXPLORING THE INSIDE
WERE THE BUTT OF THAT GIANT TREE TO SETTLE DOWN NOW IT WOULD CRUSH THEM THE BOYS STEPPED INSIDE THEY COULD SEE BUT A FEW FEET AHEAD OF THEM BUT SAW THAT THEY WERE IN A HUGE CREVICE IN THE ROCKS
JEERED STACY BROWN I THINK WE GOT A FINE TUMBLE REPLIED TAD GRINNING AND I THINK SOMETHING ELSE TOO
I I GUESS I BEGIN TO SOME SOMEBODY'S BEEN HERE YES IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE VERY MEN CAPTAIN MC KAY IS LOOKING FOR HAVE BEEN HERE COME WE MUST BE QUICK WE ARE LIKELY TO BE INTERRUPTED AT ANY TIME
A GREAT DISCOVERY BREATHED STACY TENSELY I THINK SO BUT THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT BUT GET AWAY FROM HERE WE MAY HAVE DISTURBED SOME ONE THE LADS QUICKLY SCRAMBLED UP
AUGUST STOUT HAD NOT LEARNED MUCH ABOUT SWIMMING SINCE HE FELL OFF THE PLANK WHILE FISHING IN MEADOW BROOK SO THAT OUT IN THE WAVES THE OTHER BOYS HAD GREAT FUN WITH THEIR FAT FRIEND AND THERE IS NETTIE PRENTICE EXCLAIMED NAN SUDDENLY
NEITHER DO I WANT TO GET THROWN OFF AGAIN I'M BLACK AND BLUE ALL OVER RIGHT THIS MINUTE I THINK I MUST BE BY THE FEEL OF MY SKIN HURRY STACY RAN BACK TO THE ROOTS ONCE MORE CLAMBERING TO THE TRUNK ALONG WHICH HE RAN CLEAR TO THE OUTER END
EVIDENTLY SEARCHING FOR FRIENDS OH NAN CALLED NETTIE IN DELIGHT I'M JUST AS GLAD TO SEE YOU AS I AM TO SEE THE OCEAN AND I NEVER SAW THAT BEFORE AND THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS EXCHANGED GREETINGS OF GENUINE LOVE FOR EACH OTHER
THE BOYS WERE OBLIGED TO STOOP IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THEIR EXPLORATIONS FURTHER AFTER CREEPING UNDER THE LOW HANGING ROCK THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO STAND ERECT ONCE MORE THEN THEY DISCOVERED SOMETHING ELSE THERE WERE BALES PILED ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER
FOR LOVE HATH ROBBED ME OF MY REASON'S SIGHT SLAVED ME THIS LONGING AND ENTHRALLED ME LOVE OF YOU AND CLAD IN SICKNESS GARB A POOR AND ABJECT WIGHT I WONT ERE THIS TO THINK SMALL THINGS OF LOVE
FOR WE HAVE FURNISHED IT FOR THEE AND IT IS THY SLEEPING PLACE THEREUPON I AROSE AND WENT THITHER AND SLEPT TILL MORNING WHEN A PAGE BROUGHT ME BASIN AND EWER AND I MADE THE ABLUTION AND PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER THEN I SAT DOWN
SO SHE CALLED OUT TO A HANDMAID BRING INKCASE AND PAPER AND WROTE THESE COUPLETS HOW COMES IT I FULFILLED MY VOW THE WHILE THAT VOW BROKE YOU
AND AT SHOUTING DISTANCE BEHIND HIM WALKED ANOTHER AND SO ON AT DISTANCES OF ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM EACH OTHER IN THIS WAY THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A LINE OF MEN EXTENDING FROM THE KING TO HIS PALACE WHENEVER THE KING HAD WALKED A HUNDRED YARDS THE LINE MOVED ON AFTER HIM
EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE THINK OR WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO
THAT YOU WERE THE CAUSE OF EVERY THING GOING WRONG IN THIS KINGDOM AND NOW WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO ABOUT YOUR GOVERNMENT GIVE IT UP PROMPTLY REPLIED THE KING THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD ADVISE SAID THE SPHINX
I WILL NOW ARISE AND GO SLEEP IN SOME PLACE AFAR FROM THEM AND LEAVE THEM TO THEIR PRIVACY ONE WITH OTHER SO I ROSE BUT SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF MY SKIRTS SAYING WHAT THINKEST THOU TO DO NOTHING BUT SO AND SO ANSWERED I
I WILL NOT SIT I ASKED AND WHAT IS THAT AND SHE ANSWERED NONE MAY KNOW LOVERS SECRETS AND PUTTING HER MOUTH TO JUBAYR'S EAR WHISPERED TO HIM WHERE UPON HE REPLIED
FOR HE KNOWS IF HE DOES NOT PLEASE THEM AND GOVERN THEM WELL THEY WILL GRADUALLY DROP OFF FROM HIM AND GO TO OTHER CLUSTERS
AS THEY FOLLOWED EACH OTHER THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND OVER THE DEVIOUS WAYS IN WHICH THE SPHINX HAD LED THEM IN THE CITY OF MINGLED SENTIMENTS THE KING WAS OBLIGED TO PURSUE ALL THESE COMPLICATED TURNINGS OR BE SEPARATED FROM HIS OFFICERS
AND HE WAS LODGED IN A ROOM IN THE PALACE SUCH OF HIS FOLLOWERS AS CAME WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CITY WERE ENTERTAINED BY THE PERSONS NEAR TO WHOSE HOUSES THEY FOUND THEMSELVES WHEN THE LINE HALTED EVERY DAY THE SPHINX WENT WITH HIM TO SEE THE SIGHTS OF THIS STRANGE CITY
AS SHE WERE THE FULL MOON AMONG THE STARS SITTING IN THEIR MIDST OR THE SUN WHEN IT IS CLEAR OF CLOUDS AND MIST NOR WAS THERE ON HER ANY TRACE OF PAIN OR CARE AND AS I LOOKED AND MARVELLED AT HER CASE
AND HE MINGLED THEM UP SO MUCH THAT NO ONE COULD EVER TELL EXACTLY WHAT HE THOUGHT ON ANY PARTICULAR SUBJECT OF COURSE HIS PEOPLE GRADUALLY GOT INTO THE SAME FRAME OF MIND
THE MESSAGE WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT HE MUST EITHER STOP WHERE HE WAS OR COME HOME HIS CONSTANTLY LENGTHENING LINE OF COMMUNICATION HAD USED UP ALL THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE GOVERNMENT ALL THE CLERKS IN THE DEPARTMENTS AND ALL THE OFFICIALS OF EVERY GRADE
DID SHE INDEED WRITE THIS NOTE WITH HER HAND AND FEEL IT WITH HER FINGERS ANSWERED I O MY LORD
THE KING FOUND WHEN HE HAD TIME TO LOOK INTO THE AFFAIRS OF HIS DOMINIONS THAT EVERY THING WAS IN THE MOST ADMIRABLE CONDITION THE QUEEN HAD RETAINED A FEW OF THE BEST OFFICIALS TO CARRY ON THE GOVERNMENT AND HAD ORDERED THE REST TO FALL ONE BY ONE INTO THE LINE OF COMMUNICATION
SHE TURNED HER GLANCE UPON ME AND SEEING ME STANDING AT THE DOOR SAID TO ME WELL COME AND WELCOME AND ALL HAIL TO THEE O IBN MANSUR COME IN SO I ENTERED
ONE OF HIS COUNCILLORS OFFERED TO GO TO SOME OTHER COUNTRIES AND SEE HOW THEY WERE GOVERNED AND COME BACK AND TELL HIM ALL ABOUT IT BUT THIS DID NOT SUIT HIS MAJESTY YOU WOULD SIMPLY RETURN HE SAID AND GIVE ME YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THINGS I WANT MY OWN IDEAS
AND THEREIN WERE THESE COUPLETS HOW LONG SHALL I THY COYNESS AND THY GREAT AVERSION SEE THOU HAST SATISFIED MY CENSURERS AND PLEASED THEIR ENMITY I DID AMISS AND WOT IT NOT
IT IS GOVERNED BY A KING OF MINGLED SENTIMENTS SUPPOSE WE GO THERE I THINK YOU WILL FIND A GOVERNMENT THAT IS RATHER PECULIAR THE KING CONSENTED AND THEY WALKED DOWN THE HILL TOWARD THE CITY
THE SHAYBANI WHERE I FOUND THE BENCHES OF THE PORCH BROKEN DOWN AND NE'ER A PAGE AT THE DOOR AS OF WONT AND SAID TO MYSELF HAPLY HE TOO IS DEAD THEN I STOOD STILL BEFORE THE DOOR OF HIS HOUSE
AND SAW A SKIFF WHEREIN WERE TEN DAMSELS LIKE MOONS AND AMONGST THEM THE LADY BUDUR LUTE IN HAND SHE PRELUDED IN ELEVEN MODES THEN RETURNING TO THE FIRST SANG THESE TWO COUPLETS
THAT THOU SAYEST THIS SAYING QUOTH I HAD I SAID MORE THAN THIS VERILY IT WERE BUT THE TRUTH
THE KINGS ARE CHOSEN FROM AMONG THE VERY BEST OF THEM AND EACH ONE IS ALWAYS VERY ANXIOUS TO PLEASE HIS SUBJECTS HE KNOWS THAT EVERY THING THAT HE AND HIS QUEEN AND HIS CHILDREN EAT OR DRINK OR WEAR
AND SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE TOGETHER AND HAVE KEPT THIS UP YEAR AFTER YEAR
SAID TO MYSELF MOST LIKE GRIEF HATH BROKEN THE LADY'S HEART AND SHE IS DEAD AND SOME EMIR OR OTHER HATH TAKEN UP HIS ABODE IN HER HOUSE SO I LEFT IT
AND TURN AWAY AND LOOK THEREON WITH LOATHING PURE AND MERE LOOKYE I CAST THEE OUT OF HEART AND FAR FROM VITALS MINE THEN LET THE SLANDERER WOT THIS TRUTH AND SEE I AM SINCERE
SO DEIGN TO TELL ME NOW WHATSO THEY TOLD THEE HAPLY TWAS THE MEREST CALUMNY I WISH TO WELCOME THEE DEAR LOVE EVEN AS WELCOME I SLEEP TO THESE EYES AND EYELIDS IN THE PLACE OF SLEEP TO BE
THAT YOU MADE IT A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN IT NEED TO HAVE BEEN BY TAKING ME ABOUT IN SUCH WINDING WAYS IT MAY BE SO SAID THE SPHINX WITH ITS MYSTIC SMILE WELL I AM NOT GOING TO STOP HERE SAID THE KING
THERE SHE GOES NOW SAID AMY EDIE COULDN'T WE COAX HER TO LET HIM COME IN AND GET WARM HE LOOKS SO COLD AND SHE DREW HER SISTER OUT INTO THE HALL WHERE THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS TAKING BERTIE'S PARCELS CAROLINE WHISPERED EDITH TIMIDLY
HE COULD NOT HAVE EATEN ANOTHER MOUTHFUL AFTER SUCH WONDERFUL AND UNEXPECTED GOOD FORTUNE AFTER DINNER THEY PLAYED GAMES AND CRACKED NUTS AND ROASTED APPLES UNTIL THE CLOCK STRUCK NINE THEN BERTIE GOT UP TO GO OFF ARE YOU SAID THE DOCTOR LOOKING UP FROM HIS PAPER
BETWEEN THE HILL AND THE VALLEY IT WAS ONE OF THE MOIST PLEASANTLY ODOROUS NIGHTS OF EARLY SPRING THERE WAS A CHILL IN THE EVENING AIR BUT THE GRASS WAS GROWING GREEN IN SHELTERED SPOTS
IT WAS SUNSET WHEN BERTIE LAID AN ARMFUL OF PARCELS DOWN ON THE STEPS OF DOCTOR FORBES'S HANDSOME HOUSE
BUT ALL FURTHER REMARKS WERE CUT SHORT BY THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR FORBES HOW DO YOU DO HE SAID GIVING BERTIE'S HAND A HEARTY SHAKE BUT WHERE IS THE OTHER LITTLE FELLOW MY GIRLS WERE EXPECTING BERTIE PATIENTLY REACCOUNTED FOR WILLIAM JOHN'S NON APPEARANCE
IN SPITE OF HIMSELF JEFFREY'S HEART FILLED WITH HOT REBELLION AT THE THOUGHT
I MUST BE GOING NOW I'M VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU EDITH SLIPPED FROM THE ROOM AS HE SPOKE AND MET HIM AGAIN AT THE DOOR SHE HELD OUT A PAIR OF WARM LOOKING MITTENS THESE ARE FOR WILLIAM JOHN SHE SAID SIMPLY SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN
AND WHEN HIS MOTHER WENT IN TO RUB HIS CHEST WITH LINIMENT SHE FOUND HIM WITH THE RAGGED QUILT OVER HIS HEAD CRYING COME WILLIAM JOHN I WANT TO RUB YOU I DON'T WANT TO BE RUBBED
AND THERE WAS A FUR CAP AND A PAIR OF MITTENS FOR HIM HE WONDERED WHETHER HE WAS DREAMING AND HERE'S A PICTURE BOOK FOR WILLIAM JOHN SAID AMY AND THERE IS A SLED OUT IN THE KITCHEN FOR HIM OH THERE'S THE DINNER BELL I'M AWFULLY HUNGRY
AMONG OTHER THINGS THIS POOR CHILD WAS FORCED TWICE A DAY TO DRAW WATER ABOVE A MILE AND A HALF OFF THE HOUSE AND BRING HOME A PITCHER FULL OF IT ONE DAY AS SHE WAS AT THIS FOUNTAIN THERE CAME TO HER A POOR WOMAN WHO BEGGED OF HER TO LET HER DRINK
AND I SUPPOSE HE NEVER HAD ANY CHRISTMAS EITHER THERE ARE PLENTY WHO HAVEN'T SAID THE DOCTOR TAKING UP HIS PAPER WITH A SIGH WELL GIRLIES YOU SEEM INTERESTED IN THIS LITTLE FELLOW
TO SERVE YOU WITH WATER PRAY I SUPPOSE THE SILVER TANKARD WAS BROUGHT PURELY FOR YOUR LADYSHIP WAS IT HOWEVER YOU MAY DRINK OUT OF IT IF YOU HAVE A FANCY
THAT EVENING DOCTOR FORBES NOTICED A PECULIARLY THOUGHTFUL LOOK ON EDITH'S FACE AS SHE SAT GAZING INTO THE GLOWING COAL FIRE AFTER DINNER HE LAID HIS HAND ON HER DARK CURLS INQUIRINGLY WHAT ARE YOU MUSING OVER
YES THE OLD KUNNEL'S GONE AT LAST CHRISTOPHER JACKSON WAS SAYING HE TOOK HIS TIME DYIN THAT'S SARTAIN MUST BE A KIND OF RELIEF FOR SARA SHE'S HAD TO WAIT ON HIM HAND AND FOOT FOR YEARS BUT NO DOUBT SHE'LL FEEL PRETTY LONESOME
HE HAD NO MITTENS AND HIS HANDS WERE ALMOST FROZEN AND OH PAPA JUST THINK HE SAID HE NEVER HAD ANY CHRISTMAS OR NEW YEAR AT ALL POOR LITTLE FELLOW SAID THE DOCTOR I'VE HEARD OF HIM A PRETTY HARD TIME HE HAS OF IT I THINK
JEFFREY CAUGHT SARA'S NAME AND PAUSED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE GROUP TO LISTEN SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE WERE LYING DEAD UNDER SIX FEET OF TURF AND SARA STUART'S NAME WERE PRONOUNCED ABOVE HIM HIS HEART WOULD GIVE A BOUND OF LIFE
HE WAS SO PRETTY PAPA AND EDIE GAVE HIM HER BLUE MITTENS FOR WILLIAM JOHN THE PLOT DEEPENS WHO IS WILLIAM JOHN OH A COUSIN OR SOMETHING DIDN'T HE SAY EDIE ANYWAY HE IS SICK AND HE WANTED TO GO COASTING AND BERTIE GAVE HIM HIS MITTENS
I THOUGHT YOU'D RATHER HAVE ME HOME BUT I'LL GO IF YOU WANT ME TO
THEY WERE BOTH SO DISAGREEABLE AND SO PROUD THAT THERE WAS NO LIVING WITH THEM
AND WHO IS WILLIAM JOHN HE IS MY COUSIN SAID BERTIE
I LENT THEM TO WILLIAM JOHN HE HADN'T ANY FALTERED BERTIE HE DID NOT KNOW BUT THAT THE LADY MIGHT CONSIDER IT A GRAVE CRIME TO BE MITTENLESS NO MITTENS EXCLAIMED AMY IN DISMAY WHY I HAVE THREE PAIRS
ALL THROUGH THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY HAD BEEN FAST FRIENDS SARA'S PARENTS PLACED NO BAR TO THEIR INTIMACY THEY HAD SOON CONCLUDED THAT LITTLE JEFF MILLER WAS A VERY GOOD PLAYMATE FOR SARA HE WAS GENTLE WELL BEHAVED AND MANLY
FOR IT DID NOT OCCUR TO THE BAYSIDE PEOPLE IN GENERAL THAT A COUPLE OF SHAGGY DOGS COULD BE CALLED COMPANIONS AND THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT BOOKS MAKE VERY EXCELLENT COMRADES FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO TREAT THEM ONE OF JEFFREY'S DOGS WAS WITH HIM NOW
HIS HANDS WERE CLASPED BEHIND HIM AND HIS THIN FACE WORE A THOUGHTFUL PUZZLED LOOK THE DOOR BEHIND HIM OPENED JERKINGLY AND A SCOWLING WOMAN CAME OUT WITH A PAN OF DISHWATER IN HER HAND AIN'T YOU GONE YET BERT SHE SAID SHARPLY
THERE WAS NO COMMON GROUND ON WHICH THEY MIGHT MEET ONLY ONE THING JEFFREY HAD FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE CALMLY SOME DAY SARA WOULD MARRY A MAN WHO WAS HER EQUAL WHO SAT AT HER FATHER'S TABLE AS A GUEST
AND BAYSIDE PEOPLE HAD PERIODICAL FITS OF WONDERING WHY HE HAD NEVER MARRIED THEY PITIED HIM FOR THE LONELY LIFE HE MUST LEAD ALONE THERE AT THE VALLEY FARM WITH ONLY A DEAF OLD HOUSEKEEPER AS A COMPANION
WELL THAT IS SETTLED SAID THE DOCTOR GENIALLY COME ON MONDAY THEN AND PERHAPS WE CAN DO SOMETHING FOR THAT OTHER LITTLE CHAP WILLIAM OR JOHN OR WHATEVER HIS NAME IS WILL YOU HAVE SOME MORE PUDDING BERTIE NO THANK YOU SAID BERTIE PUDDING INDEED
LITTLE BOYS WHO WON'T DO AS THEY'RE TOLD ALWAYS GET INTO TROUBLE STOP CRYING NOW I DARE SAY IF BERTIE GOES THEY'LL SEND YOU SOME CANDY OR SOMETHING BUT WILLIAM JOHN REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED HE CRIED HIMSELF TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT AND WHEN BERTIE WENT IN TO SEE HIM NEXT MORNING
TO SEE HOW FAR THE CIVILITY AND GOOD MANNERS OF THIS PRETTY GIRL WOULD GO I WILL GIVE YOU FOR GIFT CONTINUED THE FAIRY THAT AT EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK THERE SHALL COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH EITHER A FLOWER OR A JEWEL WHEN THIS PRETTY GIRL CAME HOME
AND CONSIDERING WITH HIMSELF THAT SUCH A GIFT WAS WORTH MORE THAN ANY MARRIAGE PORTION WHATSOEVER IN ANOTHER CONDUCTED HER TO THE PALACE OF THE KING HIS FATHER AND THERE MARRIED HER AS FOR HER SISTER
BUT MY CONSCIENCE DOES NOT REPROACH ME THAT MUCH THE PRISONER'S THAT MUCH WAS A CONTEMPTUOUS SNAP OF HIS FINGER AND THUMB AND YET I'VE BEEN ARRESTED AND TREATED LIKE AN ASSASSIN HE CONTINUED
AND I'LL HAVE HIM UP HERE TO MORROW MORNING I WILL ALSO QUESTION HIS WIFE
AH HE'S A MAN OF WONDERFUL POWER OBSERVED LECOQ THE DETECTIVE WAS SINCERE IN HIS PRAISE ALTHOUGH THE PRISONER HAD DISAPPOINTED HIS PLANS AND HAD EVEN INSULTED HIM
AND FOR THIS REASON ALTHOUGH I WAS LIVING I DID NOT LEGALLY EXIST FOR TO HAVE A LEGAL EXISTENCE IT IS NECESSARY THAT ONE'S NAME PARENTAGE AND BIRTHPLACE SHOULD FIGURE UPON A MUNICIPAL REGISTER
HERE HE FELT STRONGER AND MORE AT EASE FOR HIS BACK BEING TURNED TO THE WINDOW HIS FACE WAS HALF HIDDEN IN SHADOW AND IN CASE OF NEED HE COULD BY BENDING OVER HIS PAPERS CONCEAL ANY SIGN OF SURPRISE OR DISCOMFITURE
AND WITHOUT BOASTING I FLATTER MYSELF THAT I HAVE A CERTAIN KNACK
IS IT LONG SINCE YOU HAVE EATEN ANYTHING I HAVE EATEN NOTHING SINCE THAT MAN
IT SEEMED EVIDENT TO HIM THAT THE PRISONER WAS NOT FEIGNING
THE SUPPOSED MURDERER MADE NO OBJECTION HIS FACE AT ONCE ASSUMED A DIFFERENT EXPRESSION HIS FEATURES WEARING A MINGLED AIR OF IMPUDENCE CONCEIT AND IRONY
AND HE HAD NOTICED BETWEEN THE WIDOW CHUPIN'S EYEBROWS THOSE FURROWS WHICH ACCORDING TO PHYSIOGNOMISTS INDICATE A SENSELESS BRUTISH OBSTINACY WOMEN NEVER CONFESS RESUMED THE MAGISTRATE
ACCUSED PARTIES ARE PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT THE INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATE IS ALLOWED TO ADOPT SUCH MEASURES CONCERNING THEM AS HE MAY DEEM NECESSARY FOR THE INTEREST OF THE PROSECUTION
MY CONJECTURES WERE CORRECT IT SEEMS TO ME EVIDENT THAT THIS MAN IS A CRIMINAL OF THE WORST DESCRIPTION AN OLD OFFENDER CERTAINLY AND ONE WHO HAS THE STRONGEST INTEREST IN CONCEALING HIS IDENTITY
THIS MAN THEY THOUGHT IS VERY CLEVER IT WON'T BE EASY TO GET THE BETTER OF HIM
THE DEUCE TAKE HIS IMPERTINENCE I TRIED TO BITE HIM THAT'S THE TRUTH AND IF I HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HIS FINGER BETWEEN MY TEETH IT WOULD HAVE STAYED THERE HOWEVER
THAT THE WIDOW CHUPIN MENTIONED A SON OF HERS A CERTAIN POLYTE YES WHY NOT QUESTION HIM
AND A POSITIVE DREAD OF BULLETS AND CANNON BALLS LATER ON WHEN I HAD PASSED THE PROPER AGE FOR THE CONSCRIPTION
BUT A GLEAM OF PLEASED VANITY SPARKLED IN HIS EYES WHAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS FRIENDLY BENEVOLENT MAGISTRATE
AND FLOURISHING IT WILDLY BEGAN AS FOLLOWS IN A SHRILL FALSETTO VOICE
I FEEL VERY WELL I HOPE CONTINUED THE MAGISTRATE PATERNALLY THAT IN FUTURE YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO MODERATE YOUR EXCITEMENT YESTERDAY YOU TRIED TO DESTROY YOURSELF
UNEQUALED IN THE WORLD FOR THEIR FEATS UPON THE TRAPEZE AND THE TIGHT ROPE AND IN INNUMERABLE OTHER EXERCISES OF GRACE SUPPLENESS AND STRENGTH THAT IS SUFFICIENT INTERRUPTED THE MAGISTRATE
WHO CAN TELL ME WHAT POWERFUL INTEREST INDUCES HER TO REMAIN SILENT
ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE LAW
THEY DECIDED TO CALL ME AFTER THE MONTH
THAT WERE DAILY ENACTED IN HIS PRESENCE
HE WOULD HAVE BLUSHED TO HAVE TAKEN THE SLIGHTEST MEASURE OF SELF PROTECTION ACCORDINGLY HE WENT AND SAT DOWN BY THE FIREPLACE
WAS ABOUT TO MAKE AN ANGRY RESPONSE
AND HIS FEATURES ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION WHICH INDICATED EITHER CARELESS INDIFFERENCE OR COMPLETE RESIGNATION DO YOU FEEL BETTER
THIS EXPLAINS YOUR FIRST ACT OF DESPAIR BUT LATER ON FOR INSTANCE EVEN THIS MORNING YOU REFUSED TO EAT THE FOOD THAT WAS OFFERED YOU AS THE PRISONER HEARD THIS REMARK HIS LOWERING FACE SUDDENLY BRIGHTENED
HE HAD MANY WEAPONS IN HIS ARSENAL BUT NONE STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK A WOMAN'S DOGGED RESISTANCE IF I ONLY UNDERSTOOD THE MOTIVE THAT GUIDES THIS OLD HAG HE CONTINUED BUT NOT A CLUE
WOULD HAVE CONFESSED IT LONG AGO BUT SIR THIS MAN IS SURELY NOT THE BUFFOON MAY REPLIED THE YOUNG DETECTIVE NO CERTAINLY NOT
AND THAT SUCCESS WAS STILL EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL WITH THIS CHILLING CONCLUSION PRESENCE OF MIND RETURNED TURNING TOWARD THE MAGISTRATE HE EXCLAIMED YOU WILL RECOLLECT SIR
AND THEN ADDED YOU HAVE DOUBTLESS SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING THE PRISONER'S IDENTITY UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOT THE GOVERNOR SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A KNOWING AIR IN THAT CASE SAID HE
ALL NIGHT LONG THE JAILORS SAT AROUND ME LIKE CHILDREN AMUSING THEMSELVES BY TORMENTING A CHAINED ANIMAL THEY WATCHED ME TALKED ABOUT ME AND PASSED THE CANDLE TO AND FRO BEFORE MY EYES THE PRISONER TALKED FORCIBLY BUT WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT ORATORICAL DISPLAY
YOU SAY YOU HAVE LIVED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES HE INQUIRED
YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE THAT IN FRANCE BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY IN GERMANY OF COURSE I USE THE LANGUAGE OF THAT COUNTRY LET ME HEAR THEN
BUT IF I ALLOW THIS WOMAN TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE OTHER PRISONERS SHE WILL CERTAINLY FIND SOME OPPORTUNITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PARTIES OUTSIDE
ACCORDING TO HIS HABIT WHENEVER HE CONSIDERED THAT A PRISONER HAD COMMITTED SOME GRAVE BLUNDER IN THAT CASE SAID HE WILL YOU GIVE ME A SPECIMEN OF YOUR TALENT
BUT AFTER ALL I AM NOT INFALLIBLE AND I SHALL DEPEND UPON YOUR COUNSEL AND ASSISTANCE OH I HAVE MEANS OF VERIFYING MY ASSERTION INTERRUPTED THE GOVERNOR
AS NIGHT COMES ON THIS UPWARD MOVEMENT WILL CEASE AND THERE WILL BE A SEASON OF QUIET UNTIL THE EARTH HAS BECOME COLDER THAN THE AIR AND WE HAVE A PHENOMENON OF EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE KIND WHEN THE AIR CONTRACTS INSTEAD OF EXPANDS
THEY ARE WARM AND DRY AND ARE CAUSED BY AN AREA OF LOW BAROMETER AND AN ASCENDING CURRENT OF AIR OCCURRING AT SOME POINT NORTH OF THE ALPS
WITH SUCH TREMENDOUS FORCE THAT NO SHIP COULD STAND THE STRAIN
THERE ARE VERY MANY INSTANCES HOWEVER WHERE THE CAUSE CAN BE TRACED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY MANY OF THESE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED AND THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT MIGHT BE OF COURSE AS HAS BEEN OFTEN STATED THERE IS ONLY ONE REMOTE CAUSE FOR ALL WINDS AND THAT IS THE SUN
IF IT SHOULD CONTINUE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME FORTUNATELY THE SHOCK DOES NOT LAST MORE THAN EIGHT OR TEN SECONDS WHEN IT IS FOLLOWED BY A PERFECT CALM IT IS AS THOUGH A GREAT VOLUME OF AIR HAD BEEN FIRED FROM SOME ENORMOUS CANNON FROM THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN TO THE SEA
SUCH AS DURING THE PREVALENCE OF A STORM IN SOME OF THE REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA HOTTEST DURING THE DAY TIME THE NIGHTS ARE MADE ENDURABLE AND EVEN DELIGHTFUL
WHICH CAUSES THE AIR FROM ITALY TO FLOW OVER THE ALPINE RANGE CAUSING A TREMENDOUS PRECIPITATION OF SNOW AND RAIN WHICH NOT ONLY TAKES THE MOISTURE FROM THE AIR
THE ONWARD MOVEMENT OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS ABOUT THIRTY MILES PER HOUR TORNADOES OCCUR WITH GREATER FREQUENCY IN THE UNITED STATES THAN IN ANY OTHER SECTION OF THE GLOBE TORNADOES SELDOM OCCUR IN WINTER
AND PERSONS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO PERISH FROM THE EFFECTS OF THESE HOT WINDS IN OPEN BOATS OUT ON THE WATER BEFORE THEY COULD REACH LAND HOT WINDS PREVAIL ON THE PLAINS OF KANSAS DURING THE MONTHS OF JULY AND AUGUST THAT ARE PHENOMENAL IN THEIR INTENSITY
AT THAT POINT OF COURSE THERE IS NO EXPANSION BECAUSE THERE IS NO DEPTH OF AIR AND THE EFFECT WILL BE THAT THE EXPANDED AIR WILL OVERFLOW TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN AND BE DEFLECTED UP ITS SLOPING SIDE
THE AIR BECOMES HEATED TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND ARE THE RESULTING EFFECT OF CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF AIR CURRENTS IN THE HIGHER REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THAT FORCE THE ALREADY HEATED AIR TOWARD THE EARTH
THESE WINDS SPREAD EASTWARD AS FAR AS ILLINOIS BUT NOT WITH THE SAME SEVERITY AND THEY MOVE SOUTHWARD TO THE GULF OF MEXICO SPREADING OVER THE STATES OF TEXAS AND LOUISIANA AND ARE THERE CALLED NORTHERS
WYOMING MONTANA ALSO EXTENDING UP INTO BRITISH AMERICA THIS WIND WHICH IS HERE CALLED CHINOOK
BUT BY A VIOLENT COMPRESSION THERE IS A PECULIAR WIND THAT OCCURS IN SWITZERLAND OFTEN BETWEEN THE MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND MARCH THESE WINDS LAST FROM TWO TO THREE DAYS AND ARE OF GREAT VIOLENCE ESPECIALLY NEAR THE MOUNTAINS
WHICH PRODUCES A DOWNWARD CURRENT FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOP
SO MUCH SO THAT IF THEY WERE WIDESPREAD AND OF LONG CONTINUANCE LIKE THE NORTHERN BLIZZARD THEY WOULD BE ATTENDED WITH GREAT LOSS OF LIFE AND DESTRUCTION TO VEGETATION
INVOLVING GREAT LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY WHEN A TORNADO MOVES OFF THE LAND ON TO THE OCEAN IT MAY BECOME WHAT IS TERMED A WATERSPOUT THESE PROBABLY NEVER ORIGINATE ON THE WATER
SUPPOSE WE START AT A GIVEN POINT ON THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN AND RUN OUT ON A LEVEL TILL WE ARE ONE HUNDRED FEET IN A PERPENDICULAR LINE ABOVE THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN THE AIR CONTAINED WITHIN THOSE LINES WILL BE IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE
IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT ON THE SHADY SIDE OF A HIGH AND STEEP MOUNTAIN WHERE THE SUN'S RAYS STRIKE IT SO OBLIQUELY IF AT ALL THAT THE EARTH WILL BE BUT LITTLE HEATED THERE WILL BE A VAST MASS OF COLD AIR STORED UP
WHICH IS EXCEEDINGLY COLD AND LASTS SOMETIMES FOR A PERIOD OF ONE HUNDRED HOURS THE TEMPERATURE FALLS AT TIMES THIRTY OR FORTY DEGREES BELOW ZERO AND THE WIND MAINTAINS A VELOCITY OF FROM FORTY TO FIFTY MILES AN HOUR
AS SHOWN BY THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE FIRE SYRINGE IT WAS SHOWN THAT AIR AT NORMAL TEMPERATURE COULD BE SUDDENLY COMPRESSED INTO SO SMALL A SPACE THAT THE CONDENSED HEAT WHICH WAS BEFORE DIFFUSED THROUGH THE WHOLE BULK OF AIR AT NORMAL PRESSURE
THIS IS DUE PARTLY TO THE RETARDING EFFECT OF FRICTION CAUSED BY CONTACT OF THE AIR WITH THE EARTH'S SURFACE BUT MORE PARTICULARLY BY TREES INEQUALITY OF SURFACE
BUT AFTER THEY HAVE ONCE FORMED MAY BE CARRIED OVER THE WATER TO A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE A TORNADO WAS NEVER KNOWN TO ORIGINATE ON THE SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN BUT THERE ARE A FEW INSTANCES THE MOST NOTABLE ONE BEING THE RACINE TORNADO
ALTHOUGH THEY OCCUR SOMETIMES IN APRIL JUNE AND JULY
AFTER THE VALLEY HAS BECOME INTENSELY HEATED BY THE SUN THERE IS AN ASCENDING CURRENT OF AIR WHICH IN TURN CAUSES A DOWN RUSH OF THE COLD BODY OF AIR
FROM THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THESE LOCAL WINDS ARE FREQUENTLY VERY SEVERE ONLY LASTING HOWEVER FOR A SHORT TIME UNTIL AN EQUILIBRIUM OF TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED
OFTEN AN AVALANCHE OF THIS KIND WILL PRODUCE A WIND WHICH IS CONFINED OF COURSE TO A RESTRICTED AREA THAT IS SAID TO BE SO VIOLENT AS TO TEAR ONE'S CLOTHES INTO SHREDS THIS IS NOT CAUSED BY ANY DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE
AND EVEN AT SIXTY FEET THE VELOCITY IS MUCH GREATER THAN AT THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
TO THE FREEZING POINT THERE ARE HOT WINDS CALLED BY DIFFERENT NAMES ACCORDING TO THE LOCALITIES IN WHICH THEY OCCUR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR THE INHABITANTS ARE AFFLICTED WITH WHAT THEY CALL A DESERT WIND
FORTUNATELY THEY COME IN NARROW STREAKS AND IN MOST CASES DO NOT BLOW MORE THAN FROM TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES AT A TIME THESE HOT BELTS ARE SOMETIMES NOT OVER ONE HUNDRED FEET WIDE AND AGAIN THEY ARE AS MUCH AS FIVE HUNDRED
CAME A BELLOWING AS OF SOME WILD BEAST TRYING TO GET OUT WE THEN FOLLOWED UP THE SOUND AND DISCOVERED EUMOLPUS SITTING THERE SCRIBBLING VERSES UPON AN IMMENSE SHEET OF PARCHMENT ASTOUNDED THAT HE COULD FIND TIME TO WRITE POETRY AT DEATH'S VERY DOOR
COULD ENDURE THE FILTHY RAGS AND LASHINGS NECESSARY TO SUCH AN OPERATION AS STATUES DO NO THAT'S SETTLED SOME OTHER ROAD TO SAFETY MUST BE FOUND I HAVE THOUGHT UP A SCHEME SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF IT EUMOLPUS IS A MAN OF LETTERS HE WILL HAVE INK ABOUT HIM OF COURSE
BUT PASSION SCORNED BECOMES A POWER ALAS WHO COURTS HIS END BY DRAWING SWORD AMIDST THESE WAVES WHY DIE BEFORE OUR TIME
GITON AND I PACK TOGETHER WHATEVER WE HAVE FOR THE VOYAGE AND AFTER PRAYING TO THE STARS WE WENT ABOARD CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDREDTH WE PICKED OUT A RETIRED SPOT ON THE POOP AND EUMOLPUS DOZED OFF AS IT WAS NOT YET DAYLIGHT
THE EFFECTS OF OUR RESENTMENT AND BE CAREFUL THAT YOU DO NOT SPOIL YOUR CASE BY OVER CONFIDENCE WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO SOW PREJUDICE AMONG US BY CALLING THEM WELL BORN AND RESPECTABLE
LED GITON AWAY BELOW AND FITTED THE LAD OUT IN
AND THE PILOT MAY BE MOVED TO MERCY AND GRANT YOUR PRAYER EUMOLPUS DENIED THE PRACTICABILITY OF THIS IT IS ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY AFFIRMED HE THAT LARGE SHIPS ARE WARPED INTO LANDLOCKED HARBORS
BUT TO THROW AWAY LIFE WITHOUT A REASON AS IF IT WERE A THING OF NO MOMENT IS SOMETHING WHICH I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT EVEN YOU WOULD SANCTION SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS I WILL WRAP YOU UP IN TWO HIDE BAGGAGE COVERS
LEAVING THE ENDS SOMEWHAT OPEN OF COURSE SO YOU CAN BREATHE AND GET YOUR FOOD THEN I WILL RAISE A HUE AND CRY BECAUSE MY SLAVES HAVE THROWN THEMSELVES INTO THE SEA FEARING WORSE PUNISHMENT AND WHEN THE SHIP MAKES PORT I WILL CARRY YOU OUT AS BAGGAGE WITHOUT EXCITING THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION
SOME WAY OUT MUST BE FOUND UNLESS WE BRING ABOUT A SHIPWRECK AND FREE OURSELVES FROM ALL DANGERS
CAN WE TRIM OUR BEARDS AFTER THE FOREIGN STYLE NO ARTIFICIAL COLOR DIRTIES THE BODY WITHOUT CHANGING IT
TURNED WILLING EARS SHE HAD RECOGNIZED THAT VOICE HERSELF AND FLEW TO THE BOY
IF THEY HAD EMBEZZLED YOUR MONEY OR REPAID YOUR FAITH IN THEM WITH TREACHERY BY HERCULES YOU HAVE AMPLE SATISFACTION FROM THE PUNISHMENT ALREADY INFLICTED
BUT I SHOOK MY FISTS IN TRYPHAENA'S FACE AND TOLD HER IN A LOUD VOICE THAT UNLESS SHE STOPPED HURTING GITON I WOULD USE EVERY OUNCE OF MY STRENGTH AGAINST HER REPROBATE WOMAN THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON ABOARD THE SHIP WHO DESERVED A FLOGGING
I AM WELL AWARE EUMOLPUS REPLIED TO REBUT THIS DAMNING HARANGUE THAT NOTHING CAN LOOK BLACKER AGAINST THESE POOR YOUNG MEN THAN THEIR CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR AT NIGHT
AND LEAVE NO TRACE OF IT BEHIND THE SNOWS BELONG UPON THE GROUND IN WILD AND UNCULTIVATED REGIONS BUT WHERE THE EARTH HAS BEEN BEAUTIFIED BY THE CONQUEST OF THE PLOUGH THE LIGHT SNOW MELTS AWAY WHILE YOU SPEAK OF IT
AGREED ON YOUR PART LYCAS THAT YOU DO REFRAIN FROM ANNOYING ENCOLPIUS WITH ABUSIVE WORD OR REPROACHFUL LOOK THAT YOU DO NOT SEEK TO ASCERTAIN WHERE HE SLEEP AT NIGHT
WOULD YOU RECALL THE DEAD FROM THE RELUCTANT FATES WHY NOT SHAKE OFF THIS WOMANISH WEAKNESS AND ENJOY THE BLESSINGS OF LIGHT WHILE YOU CAN
WHEREUPON HE EXPLAINED TO THE ASTONISHED EUMOLPUS THE REASONS FOR THEIR ENMITY AND FOR THE DANGER WHICH THREATENED US
BY A COINCIDENCE OF DREAMS OF WHAT THEY HAD DONE CAN YOU THEN SEE HOW IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO LET OFF THOSE WHOM A GOD HAS HIMSELF DELIVERED UP TO PUNISHMENT I AM NOT A CRUEL MAN WHAT MOVES ME IS THIS
THE TREATY WAS SIGNED UPON THESE TERMS AND WE LAID DOWN OUR ARMS IT SEEMED WELL TO WIPE OUT THE PAST WITH KISSES AFTER WE HAD TAKEN OATH FOR FEAR ANY VESTIGE OF RANCOR SHOULD PERSIST IN OUR MINDS
AND THE LADY MOURNED BY ALL AS AN UNUSUAL EXAMPLE DRAGGED THROUGH THE FIFTH DAY WITHOUT NOURISHMENT A MOST FAITHFUL MAID WAS IN ATTENDANCE UPON THE POOR WOMAN SHE EITHER WEPT IN COMPANY WITH THE AFFLICTED ONE OR REPLENISHED THE LAMP WHICH WAS PLACED IN THE VAULT AS THE OCCASION REQUIRED
AND BACCHUS WITH THE FRUITFUL VINE TO CROWN
AFTER THESE REFLECTIONS WE MADE READY TO PAY THE LAST RITES TO THE CORPSE AND LYCAS WAS BURNED UPON A FUNERAL PYRE RAISED BY THE HANDS OF ENEMIES WHILE EUMOLPUS FIXING HIS EYES UPON THE FAR DISTANCE TO GAIN INSPIRATION COMPOSED AN EPITAPH FOR THE DEAD MAN
ONE TRIED TO HARPOON THE LEAPING FISH ANOTHER HAULED IN THE STRUGGLING CATCH ON BAITED HOOKS
GITON REMOVED HIS GARMENT AND CREEPING BENEATH MY TUNIC HE STUCK OUT HIS HEAD TO BE KISSED THEN FEARING SOME MORE SPITEFUL WAVE MIGHT SEPARATE US AS WE CLUNG TOGETHER HE PASSED HIS BELT AROUND US BOTH IF NOTHING ELSE HE CRIED
THE PILOT WAS NEUTRAL BUT HE DECLARED THAT UNLESS THIS MADNESS STIRRED UP BY THE LECHERY OF A COUPLE OF VAGABONDS DIED DOWN HE WOULD LET GO THE HELM THE FURY OF THE COMBATANTS CONTINUED TO RAGE NONE THE LESS FIERCELY
ANOTHER FALLS FROM HIS CHARIOT AND DASHES OUT HIS ARDENT SPIRIT THE GLUTTON CHOKES AT DINNER
CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRD GODS AND MEN FORBID THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SO BASE AN ENDING OF YOUR LIVES CRIED EUMOLPUS NO IT WILL BE BETTER TO DO AS I DIRECT AS YOU MAY GATHER FROM HIS RAZOR MY SERVANT IS A BARBER
HOW COULD WE LEAVE THE SHIP IN SUCH A MANNER AS NOT TO BE STARED AT BY ALL THE REST WITH MUFFLED HEADS WITH BARE IF MUFFLED WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO LEND THE SICK MAN A HAND IF BARE WHAT WOULD IT MEAN IF NOT PROSCRIBING OURSELVES CHAPTER THE ONE HUNDRED AND SECOND
UNTIL THE MAID SEDUCED BY THE SMELL OF THE WINE I SUPPOSE
AS THOUGH I WERE ENVELOPED IN SOME TURBULENT NIGHTMARE WAS A LONG TIME FINDING MY VOICE BUT AT LAST WITH TREMBLING HANDS I TUGGED AT THE HEM OF EUMOLPUS CLOTHING JUST AS HE WAS SINKING INTO SLUMBER FATHER I QUAVERED ON YOUR WORD OF HONOR
SEEING THAT I HAD TO BE ABOARD THE SAME VESSEL I DID IT BECAUSE THE SCOUNDRELS HAD LONG MATTED HAIR I ORDERED THE FILTH CLEARED OFF THE WRETCHES BECAUSE I DID NOT WISH TO EVEN SEEM TO MAKE A PRISON OUT OF YOUR SHIP BESIDES
LYING IN THE BOAT NIGHT AND DAY YOU COULDN'T GET RID OF THAT WATCHMAN EXCEPT BY CUTTING HIS THROAT OR THROWING HIM OVERBOARD BY FORCE CONSULT YOUR OWN COURAGE AS TO WHETHER THAT CAN BE DONE OR NOT AND AS FAR AS MY COMING WITH YOU IS CONCERNED I SHIRK NO DANGER WHICH HOLDS OUT ANY HOPES OF SUCCESS
SUPPOSE THAT THE GARMENT DID NOT STICK TO THE INK AS IT OFTEN DOES WHERE NO GUM IS USED TELL ME WE CAN'T MAKE OUR LIPS SO HIDEOUSLY THICK CAN WE WE CAN'T KINK OUR HAIR WITH A CURLING IRON CAN WE WE CAN'T HARROW OUR FOREHEADS WITH SCARS CAN WE
THE FIRST ALONE MAY BE THE CASE WITH EVERY LABOR AS EVEN THE LABORS OF NATURE E G OF ANIMALS ARE UTILIZED BY HUMANITY FOR THE FURTHERING OF SCIENCE ET CETERA THE SECOND REQUIRES THAT HE WHO LABORS
NOT AS MEN AND IS THEREFORE CALLED EGOISTIC TO THE SOCIALISTS WELFARE IS STILL THE SUPREME AIM AS FREE RIVALRY WAS THE APPROVED THING TO THE POLITICAL LIBERALS
THEORETICAL INTEREST TO WIT AN INTEREST NOT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS ALL BUT FOR THE IDEA FOR MAN
EGOISM HAS AN IMMENSE FIELD FOR FREE UTILIZATION THE LABORER WILL UTILIZE SOCIETY FOR HIS EGOISTIC ENDS AS THE COMMONER DOES THE STATE
YOU MIGHT YET ON YOUR OWN IMPULSE BE ACTIVE FOR SOMETHING FOOLISH THEREFORE UNHUMAN YES MORE YET YOU REALLY LABOR ONLY TO NOURISH YOURSELF IN GENERAL TO LIVE
IF WE LET DISINTERESTEDNESS PASS UNCHALLENGED FOR A WHILE THEN WE ASK DO YOU MEAN NOT TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN ANYTHING NOT TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC FOR ANYTHING
ONLY BY THE LABOR THAT HAS FOR ITS END NO EGOISTIC PURPOSE BUT MAN
LIVE HOW SHOULD YOU BE LESS EGOISTS IN LEISURE YOU LABOR ONLY BECAUSE HAVING YOUR TIME TO YOURSELVES IDLING GOES WELL AFTER WORK DONE AND WHAT YOU ARE TO WHILE AWAY YOUR LEISURE TIME WITH
WORK HIS LABOR OUGHT TO SATISFY HIM AS A MAN INSTEAD OF THAT IT SATISFIES SOCIETY SOCIETY OUGHT TO TREAT HIM AS A MAN AND IT TREATS HIM AS A RAG TAG LABORER OR
YOU WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE LAST JUDGMENT TILL THE DAY WHEN MAN OR HUMANITY SHALL HAVE ATTAINED PERFECTION BUT AS YOU WILL SURELY DIE BEFORE THAT
E G PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND AGAINST LIMITED SOCIETY THAT IT MAKES TOO MUCH OF MATERIAL PRIVATE INTERESTS BOTH ARE TO LEAVE PRIVATE INTERESTS TO PRIVATE PEOPLE AND
JEW THE CHRISTIAN THE
SOMETHING OF MY OWN SO EVERY OPINION MUST BE ABOLISHED OR MADE IMPERSONAL THE PERSON IS ENTITLED TO NO OPINION BUT AS SELF WILL WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE PROPERTY TO SOCIETY
NOURISHMENT AND THE LIKE IT MUST BE A LABOR FURTHERING HUMANITY CALCULATED FOR THE GOOD OF HUMANITY
NO PERSONAL PREROGATIVE IF IN THE LABORERS OR RAGAMUFFINS SOCIETY SPECIAL PRIVATE PROPERTY IS NO LONGER RECOGNIZED SO IN HUMAN SOCIETY
YET ONLY FOR THIS REASON THAT ALL MAY GAIN LEISURE TO AN EQUAL EXTENT BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO WITH THEIR LEISURE WHAT DOES YOUR SOCIETY DO THAT THIS LEISURE MAY BE PASSED HUMANLY
AS HUMAN SOCIETY CONCERN THEMSELVES SOLELY ABOUT GENERAL HUMAN INTERESTS THE POLITICIANS THINKING TO ABOLISH PERSONAL WILL SELF WILL OR ARBITRARINESS
AND UNSOCIAL PRINCIPLES TO THIS THE HUMANE LIBERAL RETORTS THE UNSETTLEDNESS OF MANY IS ONLY YOUR PRODUCT PHILISTINE BUT THAT YOU PROLETARIAN DEMAND THE GRIND OF ALL
MAKE YOURSELF BY MEANS OF IT A HUMAN BEING AND FREE FROM THOSE LIMITS MAKE YOURSELF A FREE MAN
SO IN THIS END OF THE MODERN AGE AGE OF THE MODERNS THERE RETURNS AGAIN AS THE MAIN POINT WHAT HAD BEEN THE MAIN POINT AT ITS BEGINNING INTELLECTUAL LIBERTY
AND YOU DO NOT NOTICE THAT YOU TOO ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ONLY FOR YOUR IDEA YOUR IDEA OF LIBERTY AND FURTHER DO YOU NOT NOTICE THAT YOUR DISINTERESTEDNESS IS AGAIN LIKE
OH YES BUT THAT IS NOT AN EGOISTIC INTEREST NOT INTERESTEDNESS BUT A HUMAN
THE FANATICISM OF LIBERTY FOR THIS WOULD BE A FAITH THAT AGREED WITH THE ESSENCE OF MAN AND BECAUSE ONLY MAN IS REASONABLE YOU AND I MIGHT BE VERY UNREASONABLE A REASONABLE FAITH
A LABORING RAGAMUFFIN LABOR AND SOCIETY ARE OF USE TO HIM NOT AS HE NEEDS THEM AS A MAN BUT ONLY AS HE NEEDS THEM
BUT TO THIS THERE BELONGS A CONSCIOUSNESS STRONGER MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN A LABORER CONSCIOUSNESS THE LABORER MAKES NOTHING THEREFORE HE HAS NOTHING BUT HE MAKES NOTHING
RELIGIOUS DISINTERESTEDNESS A HEAVENLY INTERESTEDNESS CERTAINLY BENEFIT TO THE INDIVIDUAL LEAVES YOU COLD AND ABSTRACTLY YOU COULD CRY
GUTENBERG'S LABOR DID NOT REMAIN INDIVIDUAL BUT BEGOT INNUMERABLE CHILDREN AND STILL LIVES TO DAY IT WAS CALCULATED FOR THE WANT OF HUMANITY AND WAS AN ETERNAL
TO THE COMMUNIST IN PARTICULAR THE HUMANE LIBERAL SAYS IF SOCIETY PRESCRIBES TO YOU YOUR ACTIVITY THEN THIS IS INDEED FREE
UNINTELLECTUAL MASS LABOR AVERSE TO LABOR AS THEY ARE THE MASSES LOVE TO MAKE LABOR EASY FOR THEMSELVES IN LITERATURE WHICH IS TO DAY FURNISHED IN MASS
